                                                     We prove the Plancherel formula for spherical Schwartz functions on a
                                                 reductive symmetric space. Our starting point is an inversion formula for
                                                 spherical smooth compactly supported functions. The latter formula was
                                                 earlier obtained from the most continuous part of the Plancherel formula
                                                 by means of a residue calculus. In the course of the present paper we
                                                 also obtain new proofs of the uniform tempered estimates for normalized
                                                 Eisenstein integrals and of the Maass–Selberg relations satisfied by the
                                                 associated C-functions.

1    Introduction
In this paper and its sequel [15] we determine the Plancherel decomposition
for a reductive symmetric space X = G/H. Here G is a real reductive Lie
group of Harish-Chandra’s class and H is an open subgroup of the group Gσ
of fixed points for an involution σ of G. In the present paper we establish the
Plancherel formula for K-finite (spherical) Schwartz functions on X, with K a σ-
invariant maximal compact subgroup of G. In [15] we shall derive the Plancherel
decomposition, in the sense of representation theory, from it.
    The space X carries a G-invariant measure dx; accordingly the regular rep-
resentation L of G in L2 (X) is unitary. The Plancherel decomposition amounts
to an explicit decomposition of L as a direct integral of irreducible unitary rep-
resentations. The reductive group G is a symmetric space of its own right, for
the left times right action of G × G. In this ‘case of the group’, the explicit
Plancherel decomposition was obtained in the sixties and early seventies in the
work of Harish-Chandra, see [30], [31], [32]. His ideas, in particular those on the
role of Eisenstein integrals and the Maass–Selberg relations satisfied by them,
have been a major influence in our work. On the other hand, our approach to
the Plancherel formula is via a residue calculus, and thus in a sense closer in
spirit to the work of R.P. Langlands on the spectral decomposition in the theory
of automorphic forms, see [37].
    The results of this paper and [15] were found and announced in the fall of
1995 when both authors were visitors of the Mittag–Leffler Institute in Djur-
sholm, Sweden. At the same time P. Delorme announced his proof of the
Plancherel theorem. His results have appeared in a series of papers, partly


                                        2
in collaboration with J. Carmona, [19], [23], [24]. At the time of the announce-
ment we relied on the theorem of Carmona and Delorme on the Maass–Selberg
relations for Eisenstein integrals, [19], Thm. 2, which in turn relied on Delorme’s
paper [23]. On the other hand, we also announced the proof of a Paley–Wiener
theorem for reductive symmetric spaces, generalizing Arthur’s theorem [1] for
the case of the group. The proof of the Paley–Wiener theorem has now appeared
in [16], which is independent of the present paper and [15]. The present paper
as well as [15] and [16] rely on [12] and [14].
    Since the time of announcement we have been able to derive the Maass–
Selberg relations from those associated with the most continuous part of the
decomposition; these had been obtained earlier in [5],[6]. The resulting proof of
the Plancherel theorem in the present paper and [15] is independent of the one in
[24]; moreover, it follows a completely different approach. Finally, we mention
that T. Oshima has announced a Plancherel formula in [39], p. 604, but the
details have not appeared. For a more extensive survey of recent developments,
we refer the reader to [13].
    For Riemannian symmetric spaces, the Plancherel formula is due to Harish-
Chandra [27] and [28], p. 48. Later, it became incorporated in the above men-
tioned formula for the group. For further results in harmonic analysis on Rie-
mannian symmetric spaces, we refer the reader to the references given in [35].
    For reductive symmetric spaces of type GC /GR , the Plancherel formula is due
to P. Harinck, [26]. Earlier, the Plancherel decomposition had been determined
for specific non-Riemannian spaces of rank one, by V.F. Molchanov, J. Faraut,
G. van Dijk and others; see [33], p. 185, for references.
    We first give a rough outline of the contents of this paper and its sequel [15].
The following global picture should be kept in mind. We first concentrate on
the Plancherel formula for K-finite functions, with K ⊂ G a maximal compact
subgroup that is chosen to be σ-stable. The latter condition is equivalent to the
condition that the Cartan involution θ determined by K commutes with σ. The
building blocks of the formula will be discrete series representations of X and
generalized principal series of the form IndGP (ξ ⊗ ν ⊗ 1), with P = MP AP NP a
σθ-stable parabolic subgroup of G with the indicated Langlands decomposition,
ξ a discrete series representation of XP : = MP /MP ∩ H and ν contained in the
space ia∗P q of unitary characters of AP /AP ∩ H. For purposes of exposition this
introduction is written under the simplifying assumption that the number of
open H-orbits on P \G is one. In general the open orbits are parametrized by
a finite set P W of representatives, and then one should take for ξ the discrete
series representations of all the spaces XP,v : = MP /MP ∩ vHv −1 , v ∈ P W.
    In [10] we obtained the most continuous part of the Plancherel decomposi-
tion; this is the part built up from representations obtained by induction from a
minimal σθ-stable parabolic subgroup P0 = M0 A0 N0 . Here M0 /M0 ∩ H is com-
pact, so the theory of the discrete series did not critically enter at this stage.
On the level of K-finite functions the most continuous part of the formula is
described via a Fourier transform F0 , which in turn is defined in terms of Eisen-
stein integrals E ◦ (P0 : λ). The latter are essentially matrix coefficients of the
principal series induced from P0 and behave finitely under the action of the

                                         3
algebra D(X) of invariant differential operators on X.
    From the most continuous part of the Plancherel decomposition we derived in
[12] a Fourier inversion formula for functions in Cc∞ (X : τ ), the space of smooth
compactly supported τ -spherical functions on X, with τ a finite dimensional
unitary representation of K. This formula expresses a function f in terms of the
meromorphic extension of F0 f to the complexification of ia∗P0 q .
    The strategy of the present paper is to put the inversion formula in a form
that makes it valid for functions in the Schwartz space C(X : τ ). This requires
the introduction of Eisenstein integrals E ◦ (P : ν), for imaginary ν ∈ ia∗P q , via
residues of the Eisenstein integrals E ◦ (P0 : · ). To show that these residual Eisen-
stein integrals define Fourier transforms on the Schwartz space we need the
Maass–Selberg relations. It is here that the theory of the discrete series, initi-
ated by M. Flensted-Jensen in [25] and further developed by T. Oshima and T.
Matsuki in [40], enters. In our proofs we do not need the full classification of the
discrete series. However, for the theory of the constant term developed in [17]
to apply, both the necessity of the rank condition and the fact that the infinites-
imal D(X)-characters of discrete series representations are real and regular (see
Theorem 16.1, due to [40]), play a crucial role.
    The resulting inversion formula for Schwartz functions is called the spheri-
cal Plancherel formula, see Theorems 21.2 and 23.1. It naturally leads to the
spherical Plancherel formula for L2 -functions, Theorem 23.4. The present pa-
per finishes at this point, where it is not yet clear that the residual Eisenstein
integrals are related to induced representations. This fact will be established in
the second paper [15] by using the vanishing theorem of [14]. The contributions
of all K-types can then be collected and lead to the representation theoretic
Plancherel formula. At the end of the second paper it will also be shown that
the residual Eisenstein integrals E ◦ (P : ν) equal the normalized Eisenstein in-
tegrals introduced in Delorme’s paper [22]. The idea is to use the automatic
continuity theorem of W. Casselman and N.R. Wallach ([20], [43]) to show that
the residual Eisenstein integrals are matrix coefficients. An asymptotic analysis
then completes the identification.
    We shall now give a more detailed outline of the present paper. The first
few sections concern preliminaries. In particular, in Section 5 we specify the
normalizations of the residual operators and the measures used in the rest of
the paper. In Section 6 we give a formulation of the vanishing theorem of [14],
in a form suitable for this paper. Let aq be a maximal abelian subspace of p ∩ q,
the intersection of the −1 eigenspaces in g for θ and σ, respectively. Let Pσ
denote the set of σθ-stable parabolic subgroups of G containing Aq : = exp aq .
                                             hyp
For each Q ∈ Pσ we introduce a space EQ          (X : τ ) of families {fν } of spherical
generalized eigenfunctions on X, depending meromorphically on the parameter
ν ∈ a∗QqC . Here aQq : = aQ ∩ q. The vanishing theorem asserts that fν = 0 for
all ν, as soon as the coefficient of eν−ρQ in the asymptotic expansion along Q
vanishes, for all ν in a non-empty open subset of a∗QqC .
    In Section 8 we recall the inversion formula of [12]. Let Σ be the root system
of aq in g and let W be the associated Weyl group. Let ∆ be the system of


                                           4
simple roots associated with the minimal element P0 from Pσ . For each F ⊂ ∆,
let PF = MF AF NF denote the associated standard parabolic subgroup in Pσ .
Then the inversion formula is of the form
                                  X
                              f=       t(a+      t
                                          F q ) TF f,
                                          F ⊂∆

where
                                    Z           Z
        TFt f (x) = t(a+
                       F q ) |W |                   KFt (ν : x : y) f (y) dy dµF (ν).   (1.1)
                                    iaF q +εF   X

Here t is a choice of W -invariant even residue weight on Σ and εF is an element
of a+ F q , sufficiently close to zero (if F = ∆, we may take εF = 0). Moreover,
dµF is a suitable choice of Lebesgue measure on ia∗F q + εF . The kernel func-
tions KFt (ν : x : y) ∈ End(Vτ ) are obtained from residual operators acting on a
combination of normalized and partial Eisenstein integrals for P0 , see [12] for
details. They are meromorphic in the variable ν ∈ a∗QqC and smooth spherical
and D(X)-finite in both of the variables x, y ∈ X. Essentially, the idea is that
the kernel KFt determines the projection onto the part of L2 (X : τ ) determined
by the induction from the standard parabolic subgroup PF .
     To make the above formula valid for Schwartz functions it is necessary to
establish it with εF = 0, for every F. This can be achieved by using Cauchy’s
formula, once we have established the regularity at ia∗F q of the kernel functions
KFt (ν, x, y) in the variable ν. In addition to this we need estimates that are
tempered in the variables x, y with uniformity in ν ∈ ia∗Qq . All this is taken care
of by a long inductive argument, that ranges over the Sections 12 – 21. We shall
describe the structure of the argument, which goes by induction on the σ-split
rank of G, at a later stage in this introduction.
     In Section 9 we recall the definition of the generalized Eisenstein integral
EF◦ (ν), for ν ∈ a∗F qC . In [12], Def. 10.7, see also [14], Remark 16.12, this Eisen-
stein integral was defined by means of a linear combination of residual operators
(a so called Laurent functional) applied to the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P0 : λ)
with respect to the variable λ. As a family in the parameter ν, the generalized
Eisenstein integral belongs to EPhyp   F
                                         (X : τ ). Hence, in view of the vanishing theo-
rem, it can be characterized uniquely in terms of its asymptotic behavior along
PF ; see Theorem 9.3.
     In Corollary 10.6 we show that the generalized Eisenstein integral is tem-
pered for regular imaginary values of ν. This fact can be derived from a limita-
tion on the asymptotic exponents, see Theorem 10.5, caused by the support of
the residual operators. Here Thm. 3.15 of [11] is crucial. In the next section,
in Proposition 11.6, we establish uniformly moderate estimates for the gener-
alized Eisenstein integrals. These estimates come from similar estimates for
E ◦ (P0 : · ), which survive the application of the residual operators.
     In Section 12 we start with the preparation of the long inductive argument
mentioned above. The reductive symmetric pair (G, H) is said to be of residue
type if the following two conditions are fulfilled, (a) G has compact center mod-
                                   t
ulo H and (b) the operator T∆        is the projection onto the discrete part L2d (X : τ )

                                                    5
of L2 (X : τ ) (which may be trivial). Condition (b) implies that the mentioned
                                                           t
operator, and hence the associated ‘discrete’ kernel K∆      , is independent of the
particular choice of residue weight t. Moreover, from condition (b) it follows
that L2d (X : τ ) is finite dimensional, a result known for all pairs (G, H) as a
consequence of [40], see also Remark 12.7.
    We proceed with the induction in Section 13. A parabolic subgroup P ∈ Pσ
is said to be of residue type if the pair (MP , MP ∩ H) is. A subset F ⊂ ∆ is said
to be of residue type, if the associated standard parabolic subgroup PF is. In the
course of the inductive argument, many results in Sections 12 – 21 will initially
be proved under the assumption that (G, H) or a parabolic subgroup from Pσ
is of residue type. Such results will always be indicated with the abbreviation
(RT) following their declaration. The chain of results marked (RT) is needed in
the induction step of Theorem 21.2, where by induction on the σ-split rank of
G it is shown that all groups from Pσ are of residue type. In particular, also all
pairs (G, H), with G having compact center modulo H, are of residue type. It
thus follows that the results marked (RT) are valid in the generality stated (see
also Remark 12.2).
    The kernel KFt (ν : · : · ) is determined by its asymptotic expansion along
PF × PF , in view of the vanishing theorem. The coefficient of eν−ρF ⊗ e−ν−ρF in
this expansion is essentially the discrete kernel of MF /MF ∩ H. If F is of residue
type, then the discrete kernel, and hence KFt , is independent of the particular
choice of t. Therefore, so is the generalized Eisenstein integral. From then on we
call this Eisenstein integral the normalized one and denote it by E ◦ (PF : ν). It
is a meromorphic function of ν ∈ a∗F qC , with values in C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(A2,F , Vτ ),
where A2,F = L2d (XF : τF ). (Without the simplifying assumption mentioned
above, the latter space is replaced by a suitable direct sum over F W.) The
unique characterization of the normalized Eisenstein integral by means of the
vanishing theorem then allows us to define it for PF replaced by any parabolic
subgroup P ∈ Pσ of residue type. In the case of the group, the characterization
allows us to identify the normalized Eisenstein integral with Harish-Chandra’s,
as defined in [29], §6, Thm. 6; see Remark 13.9.
    The definition of the normalized Eisenstein integral in turn allows us to
define a kernel function KP for arbitrary P ∈ Pσ of residue type, generalizing
the kernels for standard parabolic subgroups of residue type. In terms of the
normalized Eisenstein integrals, the kernel is given by the formula

                KP (ν : x : y) = |WP |−1 E ◦ (P : ν : x)E ∗ (P : ν : y).      (1.2)

Here WP is the subgroup of W that corresponds to the Weyl group of XP , and
E ∗ (P : ν : · ) is the dualized Eisenstein integral. The latter is the function in
C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(Vτ , A2,P ) defined by

                         E ∗ (P : ν : y): = E ◦ (P : −ν̄ : y)∗ .

Two parabolic subgroups P, Q ∈ Pσ are said to be associated, notation P ∼ Q,
if their σ-split components aP q and aQq are conjugate under W. If P, Q ∈ Pσ are


                                           6
associated, and if one of them is of residue type, then so is the other. Moreover,
the set
                W (aQq | aP q ) = {s|aP q | s ∈ W, s(aP q ) ⊂ aQq }
is non-empty. The main result of the section is Theorem 13.23, which asserts
that the kernel function is unchanged if P, ν are replaced by Q, sν, with Q ∼ P
and s ∈ W (aQq | aP q ). For P minimal, this result is a consequence of the
Maass–Selberg relations for the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P : · ), in view of (1.2).
For arbitrary P of residue type the result follows from the minimal case by
W -equivariance properties of the residue calculus.
     In Section 14 we describe the action of D(X) on the normalized Eisenstein
integral E ◦ (P : ν), for P of residue type. The diagonalization of D(XP ) on
L2d (XP : τP ), where τP : = τ |K∩P , induces a simultaneous diagonalization of the
action of D(X) on the Eisenstein integral, in view of the vanishing theorem, see
Corollary 14.4. In the next section this result is used to show that the uni-
form moderate estimates of the Eisenstein integral can be improved to uniform
tempered estimates, exploiting a technique that goes back to [5] and [42]
     In Section 16 we recall the mentioned result of [40] on the D(X)-characters
of the discrete series in Theorem 16.1. This result is of crucial importance for
Section 17, where we determine the constant term of the normalized Eisenstein
integral. In addition we use the theory of the constant term as developed in
[17], see also [30].
     The constant term of E ◦ (P : ν) along a Q ∈ Pσ with Q ∼ P describes eρQ
times the top order asymptotic behavior along Q; it is given by
                                         X
                ◦                                      ◦
              EQ  (P : ν : ma)ψ =                asν [CQ|P (s : ν)ψ](m),      (1.3)
                                  s∈W (aQq |aP q )

for ν ∈ a∗P q generic, a ∈ AQq and m ∈ XQ . Here CQ|P◦
                                                        (s : ν), the normalized
C-function, is a meromorphic Hom(A2,P , A2,Q )-valued function of ν ∈ a∗P qC .
For the description of the constant term without the simplifying assumption
mentioned above, see Corollary 17.7.
    In Section 18 we derive the Maass–Selberg relations from the invariance
property of the kernel (1.2) mentioned above. They assert the following identity
of meromorphic functions in the variable ν ∈ a∗P q ,
                           ◦
                          CQ|P (s : −ν̄)∗ CQ|P
                                           ◦
                                               (s : ν) = I,

for P, Q ∈ Pσ associated and of residue type, and for s ∈ W (aQq | aP q ). In
particular, it follows that the normalized C-functions are unitary for imaginary
ν. This in turn shows that the constant term (1.3) is regular for imaginary ν.
By a result from [7] this implies that the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P : ν) is regular
for imaginary ν, see Theorem 18.8. Because of the uniform tempered estimates
formulated in Corollary 18.12, it becomes possible to define a spherical Fourier
transform FP in the next section by the formula
                                   Z
                        FP f (ν) =    E ∗ (P : ν : x)f (x) dx,                  (1.4)
                                    X


                                           7
for f ∈ C(X : τ ), the space of τ -spherical Schwartz functions on X. Proposition
19.6 asserts that FP is a continuous linear map into the Euclidean Schwartz
space S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P , if P is of residue type. In Section 20 it is shown, using a
result from [7], that the adjoint wave packet transform, given by the formula
                                  Z
                     JP ϕ(x) =          E ◦ (P : ν : x)ϕ(ν) dµP (ν)             (1.5)
                                  ia∗
                                    Pq


is a continuous linear map from S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P into C(X : τ ), see Theorem 20.3.
Here dµP is Lebesgue measure on ia∗P q , normalized as in Section 5.
    In Section 21 the long inductive argument is completed as follows. In the
proof of Theorem 21.2, it is shown that every P ∈ Pσ is of residue type, by
induction on the σ-split rank of G. The hypothesis of the induction step implies
that one may assume that G has compact center modulo H and that every
F ( ∆ is of residue type. In view of the regularity of the normalized Eisenstein
integrals, hence of the kernels KF (ν : · : · ), for F ( ∆ and ν ∈ ia∗F q , the formula
(1.1) becomes valid with εF = 0 for every subset F ⊂ ∆ (recall that ε∆ = 0).
Moreover, by the definition of the transforms FF : = FPF and JF : = JPF , it
takes the form                    X
                            t
                      f = T∆  f+       [W : WF ] t(PF ) JF FF f.
                                  F (∆

From this one reads off that     t
                                T∆  maps Cc∞ (X : τ ) into C(X : τ ), from which it
readily follows that T∆ is the restriction to Cc∞ (X : τ ) of the orthogonal projec-
                         t

tion onto L2d (X : τ ). This argument completes the induction step; moreover, at
the same time it shows that
                                X
                            I=     [W : WF ] t(PF ) JF FF                      (1.6)
                               F ⊂∆

on Cc∞ (X : τ ) and hence on C(X : τ ) by continuity and density. It is at this point
that the role of the residue weight in the harmonic analysis becomes clear. Define
the equivalence relation ∼ on the powerset 2∆ by F ∼ F ′ ⇐⇒ PF ∼ PF ′ . Then
by the Maass–Selberg relations the composed transform JF FF only depends on
the class of F in 2∆ /∼ . Collecting the terms in (1.6) according to such classes we
obtain, by an easy counting argument, the following Fourier inversion formula
which is independent of the choice of residue weight
                                   X
                           I=            [W : WF∗ ] JF FF ,                     (1.7)
                                [F ]∈2∆ /∼

with WF∗ the normalizer of aF q in W. In other words, the residue weight describes
the weight by which an element in the class of F contributes to the above
inversion formula.
    In Section 22 we give a precise description of the kernels and images of the
Fourier transforms and their adjoints. This leads to the spherical Plancherel
theorem for Schwartz functions, Theorem 23.1 and the similar theorem for
L2 -functions, Theorem 23.4. In particular, the summands in (1.7) extend to

                                             8
L2 (X : τ ) and become orthogonal projections onto mutually orthogonal sub-
spaces.

Institute, during which these results were found, and we thank Mogens Flensted-
Jensen for several helpful discussions. We are also grateful to Jacques Carmona
and Patrick Delorme for informing us about their results on the Maass–Selberg
relations, which played a crucial role for us, as mentioned above.


2    Notation and preliminaries
Throughout this paper, G will be a real reductive group of Harish-Chandra’s
class, σ an involution of G and H an open subgroup of Gσ , the set of fixed
points for σ. The associated reductive symmetric space is denoted by

                                    X = G/H.

The algebra of G-invariant differential operators on X is denoted by D(X).
    We fix a Cartan involution θ of G that commutes with σ; thus, the associated
maximal compact subgroup K = Gθ is σ-invariant. We follow the convention
to denote Lie groups with roman capitals, and their Lie algebras with the corre-
sponding gothic lower cases. In particular, g denotes the Lie algebra of G. The
infinitesimal involutions of g associated with θ and σ are denoted by the same
symbols.
    We equip g with a G-invariant non-degenerate bilinear form B that restricts
to the Killing form on [g, g], that is positive definite on p, negative definite on
k, and for which σ is symmetric. Then hX , Y i: = −B(X, θY ) defines a positive
definite inner product on g for which the involutions θ and σ are symmetric.
Accordingly, the decompositions g = k⊕p = h⊕q into the +1 and −1 eigenspaces
of these involutions, respectively, are orthogonal. If v ⊂ g is a linear subspace,
we agree to identify v∗ with a linear subspace of g via the inner product h· , ·i.
Finally, we equip the linear dual g∗ of g with the dual inner product, and the
complexified dual g∗C with its complex bilinear extension.
    We fix a maximal abelian subspace aq of p ∩ q and denote the associated
system of restricted roots by Σ = Σ(g, aq ). This is a, possibly non-reduced, root
system; the associated Weyl group is denoted by W = W (Σ). We recall that
W ≃ NK (aq )/ZK (aq ), naturally. Accordingly, the natural image of NK∩H (aq )
in W is denoted by WK∩H .
    If P is a parabolic subgroup of G, we denote its Langlands decomposition by
P = MP AP NP and put M1P : = MP AP . A parabolic subgroup that is invariant
under the composed involution σθ is called a σ-parabolic subgroup. The set of
σ-parabolic subgroups containing Aq : = exp aq is finite and denoted by Pσ .
    We shall briefly recall the structure of the parabolic subgroups from Pσ ,
meanwhile fixing notation. For details we refer to [14], §2. If P ∈ Pσ , then MP
and AP are σ-invariant, and σNP = θNP = N̄P . The algebra aP is σ-invariant,
hence decomposes as aP = aP h ⊕ aP q , the vector sum of the intersections of aP


                                        9
with h and q, respectively. We put AP q : = exp aP q and MP σ : = MP (AP ∩ H)
and call P = MP σ AP q NP the σ-Langlands decomposition of P.
    As usual, we denote by ρP the linear functional 12 tr [ad( · )|nP ] ∈ a∗P . The
following lemma is of importance in the theory of induced representations.
Lemma 2.1 Let P ∈ Pσ . Then ρP belongs to a∗P q .
Proof: The algebras aP and nP are σθ-invariant, hence −σρP = σθρP = ρP .
This implies that ρP vanishes on aP h , hence belongs to a∗P q .     
   The space aP q is contained in aq . Let ΣP denote the collection of roots from
Σ that vanish on aP q . Then

                               aP q = ∩α∈ΣP ker α.

The subgroup of W generated by the reflections in the roots of ΣP is denoted
by WP . It equals the centralizer of aP q in W.
   Let Σ(P ) be the collection of roots from Σ that occur in nP as an aq -weight.
Then nP is the vectorial direct sum of the root spaces gα , for α ∈ Σ(P ). We put

                  Σr (P ): = Σ(nP , aP q ) = {α|aP q | α ∈ Σ(P )}.

The set
               a+
                P q : = {X ∈ aP q | α(X) > 0    for all   α ∈ Σ(P )}
is non-empty. Therefore, the elements of Σr (P ) are non-zero linear functionals
                                                                        reg
on aP q . Moreover, a+
                     P q is a connected component of the complement aP q of the
                                       +          +
union of their null spaces. We put AP q : = exp aP q .
    The collection of weights in Σr (P ) that cannot be expressed as a sum of two
elements of Σr (P ) is denoted by ∆r (P ). We recall from [14], beginning of §3,
that the set ∆r (P ) is linearly independent over R and spans Σr (P ) over N.
    If X ∈ aq , then X ∈ p, hence adX diagonalizes with real eigenvalues. It is
well known that the sum of the eigenspaces for the non-negative eigenvalues is
a parabolic subalgebra of g. Its θ-stable Levi component m1X and its nilpotent
radical nX are given by

                 m1X = ker adX,         nX = ⊕α∈Σ, α(X)>0 gα .

The associated parabolic subgroup of G is denoted by PX . If P ∈ Pσ and
X ∈ a+P q , then it follows from [14], Eqn. (2.4), that P = PX . From σθX = X it
follows that PX ∈ Pσ .
    Let ∼ be the relation of parabolic equivalence on aq , with respect to the
root system Σ. Thus, X ∼ Y if and only if for each α ∈ Σ we have α(X) >
0 ⇐⇒ α(Y ) > 0. It readily follows from the definition given above that
X ∼ Y ⇐⇒ PX = PY .

Lemma 2.2 The map P 7→ a+      P q is a bijection from Pσ onto the set aq / ∼ of
parabolic equivalence classes.


                                        10
Proof: If P ∈ Pσ and X ∈ a+    P q then P = PX , as said above. Hence, the map
X 7→ PX is a surjection from aq onto Pσ . By the last assertion before Lemma
2.2, the map factors to a bijection from aq / ∼ onto Pσ . If X ∈ aq , let P = PX .
Then Σ(P ) = {α ∈ Σ | α(X) > 0}, hence ΣP = {α ∈ Σ | α(X) = 0}, and we
see that [X] = a+                  +
                P q . Thus, P 7→ aP q is the inverse to [X] 7→ PX .            
   It follows from the description in Lemma 2.2 that the Weyl group W acts
on the finite set Pσ . We recall from [11], Def. 3.2, that a residue weight on Σ is
a map a∗q /∼ → [0, 1] such that for every Q ∈ Pσ ,
                                   X
                                                 t(a+
                                                    P q ) = 1.                  (2.1)
                             P ∈Pσ , aP q =aQq


The collection of residue weights on Σ is denoted by WT(Σ). Via the bijection
of Lemma 2.2, a weight t ∈ WT(Σ) will also be viewed as a map t: Pσ → [0, 1].
A residue weight t ∈ WT(Σ) is said to be W -invariant if t(wa+               +
                                                                  P q ) = t(aP q ) for
                                          +          +
all P ∈ Pσ and w ∈ W, and even if t(aP q ) = t(−aP q ) for all P ∈ Pσ .
    Let Pσmin the collection of minimal elements in Pσ . Then P 7→ a+        P q is a
bijection from Pσmin onto the collection of open chambers for Σ in aq . To em-
                                              +                   +
phasize this, we shall also write a+                   +
                                   q (P ): = aP q and Aq (P ): = AP q for P ∈ Pσ .
                                                                                  min
                                                   min                            min
Accordingly, W acts simply transitively on Pσ . Note that for P ∈ Pσ ,
Σ(P ) = Σr (P ) is a positive system for Σ and ∆(P ): = ∆r (P ) the associated
collection of simple roots.
    We fix a system Σ+ of positive roots for Σ; let ∆ be the associated collection
of simple roots. Given F ⊂ ∆ we define

                                 aF q : = ∩α∈F ker α

and denote by a+   F q the subset of elements X ∈ aF q such that β(X) > 0 for
β ∈ ∆ \ F. Then a+   F q is a parabolic equivalence class. The associated parabolic
subgroup PF is called the standard parabolic subgroup determined by F. We
adopt the convention to replace an index or superscript PF by F. In particular,
the Langlands decomposition of PF is denoted by PF = MF AF NF and the
centralizer of aF q in W by WF . Let

                          W F : = {s ∈ W | s(F ) ⊂ Σ+ }.

Then the canonical map W → W/WF induces a bijection W F → W/WF .
   We write P0 for P∅ , P0 = M AN0 for its Langlands decomposition and M1 : =
M A. Then P = M1 NP for every P ∈ Pσmin .
   If P ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ), we define

                            XP,v : = MP /MP ∩ vHv −1 .                          (2.2)

Here MP is a real reductive group of Harish-Chandra’s class and MP ∩vHv −1 is
an open subgroup of the group of fixed points for the involution σ v : MP → MP
defined by σ v (m) = vσ(v −1 mv)v −1 . Thus, the space in (2.2) is a reductive

                                           11
symmetric space in the class under consideration. Moreover, θ|MP is a Cartan
involution of MP that commutes with σ v ; the associated maximal compact
subgroup is KP : = K ∩ MP .
    Note that as (an isomorphism class of) a MP -homogeneous space, the sym-
metric space XP,v depends on v through its class in the double coset space
WP \W/WK∩H . Throughout this paper, P W will denote a choice of representa-
tives in NK (aq ) of WP \W/WK∩H . In general, if f is a surjective map from a
set A onto a set B, then by a choice of representatives for B in A, we mean a
subset B ⊂ A such that f |B : B → B is a bijection.
    Let ∗ aP q denote the orthocomplement of aP q in aq . Then
                                   ∗
                                       a P q = mP ∩ a q .
Moreover, for every v ∈ NK (aq ), this space is the analogue of aq for the triple
(MP , KP , MP ∩ vHv −1 ), see [14], text following (3.4).
   In analogy with (2.2), we define X1P,v : = M1P /M1P ∩ vHv −1 , for P ∈ Pσ
and v ∈ NK (aq ). The multiplication map MP × AP q → M1P induces a diffeo-
morphism
                              X1P,v ≃ XP,v × AP q .                         (2.3)
If v = e, we agree to omit v in the notation of the spaces in this product, so
that X1P = M1P /M1P ∩ H ≃ MP /MP ∩ H × AP q .
     We end this section with collecting some basic facts about θ-stable Cartan
subspaces of q, meanwhile fixing notation. We define the dual real form gd of g
as the real form of gC given by gd = ker(σθ − I) ⊕ i ker(σθ + I). Let θC and σC
be the complex linear extensions of θ and σ, respectively. Then θd : = σC |gd is a
Cartan involution of gd and σ d : = θC |gd is an involution of gd commuting with
θd .
     If v is any σ- and θ-stable subspace of g, then d v: = vC ∩ gd is a σ d - and
θ -stable subspace of gd , whose complexification equals that of v.
 d

     If b is a θ-stable Cartan subspace of q, then b = bk ⊕ bp , where bk : = b ∩ k
and bp : = b ∩ p. Moreover,
                                   d
                                     b: = ibk ⊕ bp
is a σ d -stable maximal abelian subspace of pd . We denote by Σ(b) the root
system of d b in gd , by W (b) the associated Weyl group and by I(b) the space
of W (b)-invariants in S(b), the symmetric algebra of bC . Moreover, we denote
the associated Harish-Chandra isomorphism by
                                    d           d
                    γd b :   U (gd )k /U (gd )k ∩ U (gd )kd → I(b).            (2.4)
As usual, if l is a real Lie algebra, we denote by U (l) the universal algebra of its
complexification. Via the natural isomorphism
                                                       d     d
       D(X) ≃ U (g)h /U (g)h ∩ U (g)h = U (gd )k /U (gd )k ∩ U (gd )kd ,       (2.5)
see [5], Lemma 2.1, we shall identify the algebra D(X) with the algebra on the
left-hand side of (2.4) and thus view the Harish-Chandra isomorphism γd b as
an algebra isomorphism from D(X) onto I(b); as such it is denoted by γ = γb .

                                              12
   If P ∈ Pσ and b a θ-stable Cartan subspace of q containing aP q , we agree
to write ∗ bP : = b ∩ mP . Then ∗ bP is a θ-stable Cartan subspace of mP ∩ q and

                                  b = ∗ bP ⊕ aP q ,                              (2.6)

with orthogonal summands. If P is minimal, then b is maximally split, and we
suppress the index P, so that b = ∗ b ⊕ aq . We shall write W (∗ bP ) for the Weyl
group of the pair (mP C , ∗ bP ). Via the decomposition (2.6) this Weyl group is
naturally identified with WP (b), the centralizer of aP q in W (b).


3    Weyl groups
In this section we discuss a straightforward generalization of well known results
on Weyl groups, see [30], p. 111.
    If a1 and a2 are abelian subspaces of p, then following [30], p. 112, we define
the set

           W (a2 | a1 ): = {s ∈ Hom(a1 , a2 ) | ∃ g ∈ G: s = Ad(g)|a1 }.

From the definition it is obvious that the set W (a2 | a1 ) consists of injective
linear maps. In particular, if dim a1 = dim a2 , it consists of linear isomorphisms.
Finally, if a1 = a2 , the set is a subgroup of GL(a1 ) = GL(a2 ). We note that
W (a1 | a1 ) naturally acts from the right on W (a2 | a1 ), whereas W (a2 | a2 )
naturally acts from the left. If dim a1 = dim a2 , then both of these actions are
transitive and free. If ap is a maximal abelian subspace of p, then by W (g, ap )
we denote the Weyl group of Σ(g, ap ), the root system of ap in g.

Lemma 3.1 Let a1 and a2 be abelian subspaces of p.
 (a) The set W (a1 | a2 ) is finite.
 (b) If ϕ ∈ Int(gC ) maps a1 into a2 then ϕ|a1 ∈ W (a2 | a1 ).
 (c) If s ∈ W (a2 | a1 ), then there exists a k ∈ Ke such that s = Ad(k)|a1 .
 (d) Assume that a1 and a2 are contained in a maximal abelian subspace ap of
     p. Then

              W (a2 | a1 ) = {t ∈ Hom(a1 , a2 ) | ∃s ∈ W (g, ap ): t = s|a1 }.

Proof: All assertions are immediate consequences of Corollaries 1, 2 and 3 of
[30], p. 112.                                                              

Corollary 3.2
 (a) W = W (aq | aq ).
 (b) Let ap be a maximal abelian subspace of p, containing aq . Then the map
     k 7→ Ad(k)|aq is a surjection from NKe (aq ) ∩ NKe (ap ) onto W.

                                         13
Proof: The map k 7→ Ad(k)|aq induces a natural isomorphism NK (aq )/ZK (aq ) ≃
W, see, e.g., [4], Lemma 1.2. Hence, W ⊂ W (aq | aq ). For the converse inclusion,
select a maximal abelian subspace ap of p, containing aq . Then by Lemma 3.1
(d), any element t ∈ W (aq | aq ) is the restriction of an element s ∈ W (g, ap ).
There exists a k ∈ NKe (ap ) such that s = Ad(k)|ap . The element k necessarily
normalizes aq . Thus, we obtain the converse inclusion and also the validity of
assertion (b).                                                                  
   The following lemma generalizes Lemma 1 of [30], p. 111. Let aq be a
maximal abelian subspace of p ∩ q. Let ap be a maximal abelian subspace of
p containing aq , and j a Cartan subalgebra of g containing ap . We denote by
W (gC , jC ) the Weyl group of the root system of jC in gC .

Lemma 3.3 Two elements of aq are conjugate under Int(gC ) if and only if
they are conjugate under any one of the following groups

           W (gC , jC ), W (g, ap ), W = W (g, aq ), NKe (ap ) ∩ NKe (aq ).

Moreover, given P ∈ Pσmin and H ∈ aq , there is a unique element H0 ∈ cl a+
                                                                          q (P )
which is conjugate to H under W.

Proof: If P ∈ Pσmin , then a+  q (P ) is the open positive chamber for the positive
system Σ(P ) of the root system Σ. Also, W is the Weyl group of Σ. Thus, the
final assertion follows by a well known property of Weyl groups. We turn to the
assertions about equivalence of conjugation.
    For the first two listed groups the equivalence follows from Lemma 1 in [30],
p. 111. For the equivalence for the third group, let H1 , H2 ∈ aq and assume
that H2 = ϕ(H1 ) for some ϕ ∈ Int(gC ). We may fix P ∈ Pσmin such that
                                                          −1
H1 ∈ cl (a+ q (P )). There exists a s ∈ W such that s        (H2 ) ∈ cl (a+
                                                                          q (P )). Fix
            +
a choice Σ (g, ap ) of positive roots for Σ(g, ap ) that is compatible with Σ(P ),
and let a+                                                    +              +
          p be the associated positive chamber. Then cl (aq (P )) ⊂ cl (ap ). Since
                                                                    −1
W is naturally isomorphic to NK (aq )/ZK (aq ), the elements s (H2 ) and H1
are conjugate under Int(gC ). Hence, they are already conjugate under W (g, ap ).
Being both contained in cl (a+  p ), the elements must be equal and we conclude
that H2 = s(H1 ). The equivalence for the third group now follows.
    Using Corollary 3.2 (b), we immediately obtain the equivalence for the fourth
group from the one for the third.                                                   

Lemma 3.4 Let a be a linear subspace of aq and assume that ϕ ∈ Int(gC ) maps
a into aq . Then there exists a s ∈ W such that s|a = ϕ|a .

Proof: The proof is identical to the proof of Cor. 2 in [30], p. 112, with use of
Lemma 3.3 instead of [30], Lemma 1.                                            

Corollary 3.5 Let a1 , a2 be linear subspaces of aq , then

             W (a2 | a1 ) = {t ∈ Hom(a1 , a2 ) | ∃ s ∈ W : t = s|a1 }.


                                         14
    We briefly interrupt our discussion of Weyl groups to collect some useful
facts about conjugacy classes of the parabolic subgroups from Pσ .

Lemma 3.6 Let ap be a maximal abelian subspace of p, containing aq , and let
Q ∈ Pσ .
 (a) There exists a k ∈ NKe (aq ) ∩ NKe (ap ) such that kQk −1 is standard.
 (b) If F, F ′ ⊂ ∆ are such that PF and PF ′ are conjugate under G, then F =
     F ′.
 (c) There exists a unique subset F ⊂ ∆ such that Q is conjugate to PF under
     G.
 (d) If P ∈ Pσ is conjugate to Q under G, then it is already conjugate to Q
     under NKe (aq ) ∩ NKe (ap ).

Proof: There exists a s ∈ W such that the parabolic equivalence class s(a+   Qq )
                                            +
is contained in cl a+
                    q (P0 ), hence equals a Fq , for some F ⊂ ∆. It follows that
sQs−1 = PF , see Section 2. Now apply Corollary 3.2 (b) to obtain (a).
    For (b), we note that PF and PF ′ both contain the minimal standard σ-
parabolic subgroup P0 . Hence, PF = PF ′ , by [30], p. 111, Lemma 2. This
implies that F = F ′ , see Section 2. Assertions (c) and (d) both follow from
combining (a) and (b).                                                        
   We end this section with a discussion of automorphisms connecting θ-stable
Cartan subspaces of q; see Section 2 for basic notation.
   If b1 and b2 are two θ-stable abelian subspaces of q, then we define

              W (b2 | b1 ): = {ϕ|b1C | ϕ ∈ Int(gC ), ϕ(d b1 ) ⊂ d b2 }.       (3.1)

Note that d b2 and d b1 are abelian subspaces of pd . Using the notation of the
first part of this section, relative to the algebra gd = kd ⊕ pd with the indicated
Cartan decomposition, we see that complex linear extension induces a natural
isomorphism
                             W (d b2 | d b1 ) ≃ W (b2 | b1 ).
In particular, it follows from this that the set in (3.1) is finite. Moreover, if b1
and b2 are contained in p ∩ q, the notation (3.1) is consistent with the notation
introduced earlier in this section.
Lemma 3.7 Let b1 and b2 two θ-stable subspaces of a fixed θ-stable Cartan
subspace d of q. Then

                W (b2 | b1 ) = {s|b1C | s ∈ W (d), s(d b1 ) ⊂ d b2 }.

Proof: This follows from Corollary 3.5 applied with a1 = d b1 , a2 = d b2 and
ap = d d.                                                                   



                                         15
   If s ∈ W (b2 | b1 ), then by s∗ we denote the map b∗2C → b∗1C given by pull-
back, i.e.,
                            s∗ ν: = ν ◦ s, (ν ∈ b∗2C ).
If b1 , b2 ⊂ q are two θ-stable Cartan subspaces, then d b1 and d b2 are conjugate
under an interior automorphism of gd that commutes with θd ; hence, the set
W (b2 | b1 ) is non-empty and consists of isomorphisms. If s is any isomorphism
from this set, we denote its natural extension to the symmetric algebras by s as
well. This extension maps I(b1 ) into I(b2 ).

Lemma 3.8 Let b1 , b2 be θ-stable Cartan subspaces of q. Then W (b2 | b1 ) 6= ∅.
Moreover, if s ∈ W (b2 | b1 ), then

                                   s ◦ γb 1 = γb 2 .

Proof: The first assertion follows from the discussion preceding the lemma.
                                                                        d
    Let K d be the analytic subgroup of Int(gC ) generated by eadk . Then by
Lemma 3.1, applied to d b1 , d b2 ⊂ pd , there exists an element k ∈ K d such that
                                                              d        d
s = k|d b1 . The action of k induces the identity on U (gd )k /U (kd )k ∩ U (gd )kd .
Hence, if D belongs to the latter algebra, then sγb1 (D) = kγb1 (k −1 · D) =
γb2 (D).                                                                          


4    Laurent functionals and operators
In this section we briefly recall the concept of Laurent functional, introduced in
[14]; meanwhile, we fix notation that will be used in the rest of the paper. For
details we refer to Sections 10 and 11 of [14].
    Let V be a finite dimensional real linear space, equipped with a positive
definite inner product h · , · i. Its complexification VC is equipped with the com-
plex bilinear extension of the inner product. We write P (V ) for the algebra
of polynomial functions VC → C, and S(V ) for the symmetric algebra of VC .
We identify the latter algebra with the algebra of translation invariant differen-
tial operators on V, which in turn is identified with the algebra of translation
invariant holomorphic differential operators on VC . In both settings, u ∈ V is
identified with the differential operator f 7→ df ( · )u.
    Let X be a finite subset of non-zero elements of V. By an X-hyperplane in
VC we mean an affine hyperplane of the form H = a + ξC⊥ , with a ∈ VC and
ξ ∈ X. The hyperplane H is said to be real if a may be chosen in V. By

                                      ΠX (V )                                  (4.1)

we denote the collection of polynomial functions p ∈ P (VC ) with zero locus
p−1 (0) equal to a finite union of X-hyperplanes. The subset consisting of p with
zero locus a finite union of real X-hyperplanes is denoted by ΠX,R (V ). Note that
ΠX (V ) consists of all polynomial functions that may be written as a non-zero
multiple of a product of factors of the form hξ , · i − c, with ξ ∈ X and c ∈ C.
The subset ΠX,R (V ) consists of such products with c ∈ R in all factors.

                                         16
    By an X-configuration in VC we mean a locally finite collection of X-hyperplanes
in VC . The configuration is said to be real if all its hyperplanes are real. If a ∈ VC ,
then by M(VC , a, X) we denote the space of germs at a of meromorphic func-
tions with singular locus contained in the union of the hyperplanes a + ξC⊥ , for
ξ ∈ X. Let NX denote the space of maps X → N. For d ∈ NX we define the
polynomial function πa,d ∈ ΠX (V ) by
                                         Y
                              πa,d (z) =     hξ , z − aid .
                                        ξ∈X

Let Oa (VC ) denote the space of germs of holomorphic functions at a. Then
                                          −1
M(VC , a, X) is the union of the spaces πa,d Oa (VC ) for d ∈ NX . The space
             ∗
M(VC , a, X)laur of X-Laurent functionals at a is defined as the subspace of
M(VC , a, X)∗ consisting of L with the property that for every d ∈ NX there
exists a uL,d ∈ S(V ) such that
                                                         −1
               Lϕ = [uL,d πa,d ϕ](a),     for all   ϕ ∈ πa,d Oa (VC ).
The element uL belongs to a projective limit space S← (V, X) whose definition
is suggested by the above, see [14], Sect. 10, for more details. Moreover, the
map L 7→ uL defines a linear isomorphism
                                              ≃
                          M(VC , a, X)∗laur −→ S← (V, X),                       (4.2)
see [14], Lemma 10.4.
    The space on the left-hand side of the above isomorphism only depends on
X through its proportionality class. More precisely, a finite set X ′ ⊂ V \ {0}
is said to be proportional to X if every element of one of the sets X, X ′ is
proportional to an element of the other set. If X and X ′ are proportional sets,
then M(VC , a, X)∗laur = M(VC , a, X ′ )∗laur , see [14], Lemma 10.3.
    If Ω ⊂ VC is open and E a complete locally convex space, then a (densely
defined) E-valued function f on Ω is said to be meromorphic if for every z0 ∈ Ω
there exists an open neighborhood Ω0 of z0 and a holomorphic function g ∈
O(Ω0 ) such that gf |Ω0 is a holomorphic E-valued function on Ω. The space of
E-valued meromorphic functions on Ω is denoted by M(Ω, E). A point z ∈ Ω is
said to be a regular point of f ∈ M(Ω, E) if f is holomorphic in a neighborhood
of z. The collection of regular points of f is denoted by reg f.
    Let H be an X-configuration in VC . By M(VC , H, E) we denote the space of
meromorphic functions VC → E with singular locus contained in ∪H. We agree
to write M(VC , H): = M(VC , H, C).
    The space M(VC , H, E) is topologized as follows. Let X 0 ⊂ X be minimal
subject to the condition that X 0 and X are proportional. For each X-hyperplane
H ⊂ VC there exists a unique αH ∈ X 0 and a unique first order polynomial
                                                                       −1
function lH of the form z 7→ hαH , zi − c, with c ∈ C, such that H = lH   (0).
                      H                                             H
    We denote by N the space of maps H → N. For d ∈ N and ω ⊂ VC a
bounded subset, we define the polynomial function πω,d ∈ ΠX (V ) by
                                            Y d(H)
                                πω,d =             lH .                     (4.3)
                                         H∈H
                                        H∩ω6=∅




                                         17
A change of choice of X 0 only causes a change of this polynomial by a non-
zero factor. If E is a complete locally convex space, we define M(VC , H, d, E)
to be the space of meromorphic E-valued functions ϕ on VC with the property
that πω,d ϕ is holomorphic on ω, for every bounded open subset ω ⊂ VC . This
space is equipped with the weakest locally convex topology that makes every
map ϕ 7→ πω,d ϕ|ω continuous from M(VC , H, d, E) to O(ω, E). This topology is
complete; it is Fréchet if E is. We equip NH with the partial ordering  defined
by d  d′ ⇐⇒ ∀H ∈ H: d(H) ≤ d′ (H). We now have

                     M(VC , H, E) = ∪d∈N H M(VC , H, d, E).

Accordingly, we equip the space on the left-hand side with the direct limit locally
convex topology.
    Any non-empty intersection of X-hyperplanes in VC is called an X-subspace
of VC . An X-subspace L of VC may be written as L = a+VLC , with VL ⊂ V a real
linear subspace. Let VL⊥C denote the complexification of its orthocomplement.
The intersection VL⊥C ∩ L consists of a single point c(L), called the central point
of L. Via the translation x 7→ c(L) + x from VLC onto L we equip L with the
structure of a complex linear space, together with a real form with a positive
definite inner product on it.
    If H is an X-configuration and L ⊂ V an X-affine subspace, we define HL
to be the collection of affine hyperplanes in L of the form H ∩ L, with H ∈ H
a hyperplane that properly intersects L. Let X(L): = X ∩ VL⊥ and let Xr ⊂ VL
be the image of X \ X(L) under the orthogonal projection onto VL . The image
of Xr in L under translation by c(L) is denoted by XL . Thus, (L, XL ) is the
analogue of (VC , X). The collection HL is a XL -configuration in L.
    If L is a Laurent functional in M(VL⊥C , 0, X(L))∗laur, then L induces a con-
tinuous linear map
                           L∗ : M(VC , H) → M(L, HL ),
given by the formula
                             L∗ ϕ(ν): = L[ϕ( · + ν)],                        (4.4)
for ϕ ∈ M(VC , H) and generic ν ∈ L. The map L∗ belongs to the space
Laur (VC , L, H) of Laurent operators M(VC , H) → M(L, HL ), as defined in [11],
Sect. 1.3, see also [14], Sect. 11. It follows from the definition of Laurent op-
erator combined with the isomorphism M(VL⊥C , 0, X(L))∗laur ≃ S← (VL⊥ , X(L))
given by (4.2) that the map L 7→ L∗ defines a linear surjection

                   M(VL , X(L), 0)∗laur → Laur (VC , L, H) → 0.              (4.5)

Accordingly, a Laurent operator may alternatively be defined as any continu-
ous linear operator M(VC , H) → M(L, HL ) of the form L∗ with L a Laurent
functional from the space on the left-hand side of (4.5).
    More generally, if L ∈ M(VL , X(L), 0)∗laur and if E is a complete locally
convex space then the algebraic tensor product L∗ ⊗ IE has a unique extension
to a continuous linear map M(VC , H, E) → M(L, HL , E) that we briefly denote
by L∗ again.

                                        18
    The concept of Laurent functional may be extended as follows, see [14],
Def. 10.8. Let M(VC , ∗, X)∗laur be the disjoint union of the spaces M(VC , a, X)∗laur ,
for a ∈ VC . An X-Laurent functional on VC is defined to be a finitely sup-
ported section of M(VC , ∗, X)∗laur, i.e., a map L: VC → M(VC , ∗, X)∗laur with
La ∈ M(VC , a, X)∗laur for every a ∈ VC and with supp L: = {a ∈ VC | La 6= 0} a
finite set. The set of all X-Laurent functionals on VC naturally forms a complex
linear space, denoted M(VC , X)∗laur .
    Let H, L be as before. If a ∈ VC we denote by HL (a) the XL -configuration
consisting of all hyperplanes H ′ in L for which there exists a H ∈ H such that
H ′ = L ∩ [(−a) + H]. If S ⊂ VL⊥C is a finite subset, we put
                               HL (S) = ∪a∈S HL (a).                              (4.6)
Let now L ∈ M(VC⊥ , X)∗laur and put S = supp L. Then from the above discussion
it follows in a straightforward manner that the formula (4.4) defines a continuous
linear map L∗ : M(VC , H) → M(L, HL (S)). As above, if E is a complete locally
convex space, then the tensor product map L∗ ⊗ IE has a unique extension to
a continuous linear map
                       L∗ : M(VC , H, E) → M(L, HL (S), E);                       (4.7)
see [14], Cor. 11.6.
    By M(VC , X, E) we denote the space of meromorphic E-valued functions
on VC with singular locus contained in the union of an X-configuration. Every
Laurent functional L ∈ M(VL⊥C , X(L))∗laur determines a unique continuous linear
map L∗ : M(VC , X, E) → M(L, XL , E) such that L∗ restricts to the map (4.7)
for every X-configuration H in VC . See [14], Lemma 11.8, for details.


5     Normalization of residues and measures
For the explicit determination of the constants in the Plancherel formula, it is
of importance to specify the precise normalizations of residual operators and
measures that will be used in the rest of this paper.
    Let P0 be the standard parabolic subgroup in Pσmin and let t ∈ WT(Σ)
be a W -invariant residue weight, see § 2. Let b be a W -invariant positive
definite inner product on a∗q . Associated with the data Σ+ , t, b, we defined in
[11], beginning of § 3.4, for each subset F ⊂ ∆ and every element λ ∈ ∗ a∗F q , a
universal residue operator
                               Restλ+a∗F q : = ResP0 ,t
                                                  λ+a∗ ,                          (5.1)
                                                     Fq


which encodes the procedure of taking a residue along the affine subspace λ +
a∗F qC of a∗qC . In [11], text below Eqn. (3.6), this residue operator is introduced
as an element of a project limit space S← (∗ a∗F q , Σ̄+
                                                       F ), defined in [11], § 1.3; here
  +
Σ̄F denotes the collection of indivisible roots in Σ+ ∩ ∗ a∗F q . However, to make
the residue operator into an object as canonical as possible, we shall prefer to
view it as a Laurent functional.

                                          19
   Applying the results of Section 4 with V = ∗ a∗F q , X = ΣF , X 0 = Σ̄+
                                                                         F and
a = 0, we obtain an isomorphism
                       M(∗ a∗F qC , 0, ΣF )∗laur ≃ S← (∗ a∗F q , Σ̄+
                                                                   F ).              (5.2)
In the present paper, the universal residue operator (5.1) is accordingly viewed
as an element of the space M(∗ a∗F qC , 0, ΣF )∗laur of ΣF -Laurent functionals at the
origin in ∗ a∗F qC .
     By Eqn. (4.5), with V = a∗q , X = Σ and L = λ + a∗F q , we see that L 7→
L∗ induces a surjective linear map from M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur onto Laur (a∗qC , λ +
a∗F qC , H). In this context we omit the star in the notation, and use the notation
(5.1) also for the Laurent operator defined by the universal residue operator.
Thus, (4.4) becomes
                       (Restλ+a∗F q ϕ)(ν) = Restλ+a∗F q [ϕ( · + ν)],
for every ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , H) and ν ∈ a∗F qC generic. In this way the notation becomes
compatible with the notation of [11].
    All definitions in [11] are given with reference to the fixed W -invariant inner
product b on a∗q , denoted h · , · i in [11], so that a priori the universal residue
operator depends on the particular choice of the inner product. However, as
we will show, the dependence is through certain measures determined by b. To
explain this, it is convenient to first introduce some general terminology.
    If v is a real finite dimensional vector space, let ◦∧ (v) denote the one di-
mensional real linear space of densities on v, i.e., the space of maps ω: vn → R,
where n = dim v, transforming according to the rule ω ◦ An = | det A| ω, for all
A ∈ End(v). Evaluation at the origin induces a natural isomorphism from the
space of translation invariant densities on v, where v is viewed as a manifold,
onto ◦∧(v); we shall identify accordingly. Consequently, via integration the space
◦
 ∧(v) may be identified with the space of Radon measures Rdλ, where dλ is a
choice of Lebesgue measure on v. If v is equipped with a positive definite in-
ner product, then by the normalized density on v we mean the unique element
ω ∈ ◦∧(v) such that ω(e1 , . . . , en ) = 1, for every orthonormal basis e1 , . . . , en of
v.
    We shall often encounter the situation that v = ib with b a subspace of a
real linear space V ; here multiplication by i is defined in the complexification
VC of V. If V comes equipped with a positive definite inner product h · , · i, we
extend it to VC by complex bilinearity, and equip ib with the positive definite
inner product −h · , · i. Accordingly, in this setting it makes sense to speak of
the normalized density on ib.
    Let dµ ∈ ◦∧ (ib). If λ ∈ VC , then we shall adopt the convention to also
denote by dµ the density on the real affine subspace λ + ib of VC , obtained by
transportation under the translation X 7→ λ + X, ib → λ + ib. Accordingly,
by unoriented integration, the density dµ determines a real Radon measure on
λ + ib, which we shall denote by the same symbol.
    We now return to the dependence of the residue operator (5.1) on the choice
of b. For every α ∈ Σ, the orthogonal reflection sα is independent of the par-
ticular choice of b, and therefore so are the root hyperplanes α⊥ , and, more

                                             20
generally, the root spaces a∗F q and their orthocomplements ∗ a∗F q , for F ⊂ ∆.
Combining this observation with the uniqueness statement of [11], Theorem
1.13, it follows that the residue operator Restλ+a∗F q can be completely defined in
terms of the data Σ+ , t, λ + a∗F q and b; moreover, it depends on the latter datum
through the quotient measure on i∗ a∗F q of the normalized Lebesgue measures
dλ on ia∗q and dµF on ia∗F q .
    To keep track of constants coming from comparing residue operators related
to different choices of the mentioned inner product we shall introduce a version
of the residue operator (5.1) that is independent of the choice of b.
    The unnormalized residue operator is defined as the unique Laurent func-
tional
             Restλ+a∗F q ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , 0, ΣF )∗laur ⊗ Hom(◦∧(ia∗q ), ◦∧(ia∗F q )) (5.3)

satisfying the following requirement. Let (5.1) be defined relative to the given
choice of b and let dλ ∈ ◦∧(ia∗q ) and dµF ∈ ◦∧(ia∗F q ) be the normalized densities
associated with b. Then the requirement is that

                      Restλ+a∗F q (ϕ)(dλ) = Restλ+a∗F q (ϕ) dµF ,                 (5.4)

for ϕ ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , 0, ΣF ). From the above mentioned dependence of (5.1) on b
through the quotient density on i∗ a∗F q of dλ and dµF , it follows that the residue
operator in (5.3) only depends on the data Σ+ , t, F, λ and not on the choice of
b. In other words, if (5.1), dλ and dµF had been defined relative to an arbitrary
W -invariant inner product on aq , then formula (5.4) would be valid as well.
    Suppose now that for each F ⊂ ∆ a non-trivial density dµF ∈ ◦∧(ia∗F q ) is
given. In particular, dλ: = dµ∅ is given. Then we can use the formula (5.4) to
define residual operators Restλ+a∗F q . With this definition, the integral formula of
[11], Thm. 3.16, is valid.
    In the rest of this paper, we fix a choice dx of invariant measure on X. In the
rest of this section we will describe how this choice determines all other choices
of normalization of measures, and, by the preceding discussion, all choices of
normalization of residual operators.
    As in [10], § 3, the measure dx determines a choice da of Haar measure on
Aq , and a choice dλ of Lebesgue measure on ia∗q . A change of the measure dx by
a multiplication by a positive factor c causes a change of da by the same factor.
This in turn causes a change of the measure dλ by the factor c−1 . It follows that
the product measure dx dλ on X × ia∗q is independent of the particular choice of
the measure dx.
    In order to be able to use the formula (5.2) of [12], we normalize the Lebesgue
measures dµF of ia∗F q , for F ⊂ ∆, as in the text following the mentioned formula.
We describe this normalization in a somewhat more general setting, in terms of
the above terminology. Let B be the bilinear form of g, fixed in the beginning
of Section 2. Via restriction and dualization, B induces a positive definite inner
product on a∗q , which we denote by B as well. Let c > 0 be the positive constant
such that dλ corresponds to the density on ia∗q , normalized relative to the inner
product cB.

                                          21
    If P ∈ Pσ , then dµP denotes the Lebesgue measure on ia∗P q normalized with
respect to cB. If a∗Gq = {0}, which occurs if and only if G has a compact center
modulo H, we agree that dµG has total volume 1, in accordance with [12], text
following (5.2).
    The residual operators Restλ+a∗F q are now normalized by (5.4) and with re-
spect to the choices of normalizations of measures made. All results of [11]
and [12] needed in this paper are valid with the normalization of measures and
residual operators just described.
    If P ∈ Pσ , we denote by dλP the choice of Lebesgue measure on i∗ a∗P q for
which
                                 dλ = dλP dµP .                            (5.5)
If v ∈ P W, then by the above discussion of the normalization of dλ, applied to
the space XP,v , a choice dxP,v of invariant measure on XP,v corresponds in one-
to-one fashion with a choice of Lebesgue measure dλP,v on i∗ a∗P q . Throughout
this paper we agree to select dxP,v so that dλP,v = dλP .
    We end this section with the observation that for P, Q ∈ Pσ with aP q and
aQq conjugate under W, the measures dµP and dµQ are W -conjugate. Indeed,
this follows from the W -invariance of the inner product B. From (5.5) we see
that the measures dλP and dλQ are W -conjugate as well.


6    A vanishing theorem
Let Q ∈ Pσ . Throughout this paper, we assume (τ, Vτ ) to be a finite dimensional
                                                                     hyp
unitary representation of K. In this section we introduce a space EQ     (X : τ ) of
meromorphic families of D(X)-finite τ -spherical functions and show that the
vanishing theorem of [14] applies to it.
   Let areg
         q denote the set of regular elements in aq for the root system Σ and
put Areg         reg
      q : = exp aq . We define a subset of X by

                                 X+ : = KAreg
                                          q H.

According to [14], Sect. 2, this set is open dense in X. Let W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a
choice of representatives for W/WK∩H . Then, for each P ∈ Pσmin ,

                X+ = ∪v∈W KA+
                            P q vH                 (disjoint union).

By C ∞ (X+ : τ ) we denote the space of smooth functions f : X+ → Vτ that are
τ -spherical, i.e.,

                     f (kx) = τ (k)f (x)        (x ∈ X+ , k ∈ K).

By A(X+ : τ ) we denote the subspace of f ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ ) that behave finitely
under the action of the algebra D(X). Moreover, we denote the subspaces of
these spaces consisting of functions that extend smoothly from X+ to all of X
by C ∞ (X : τ ) and A(X : τ ), respectively.


                                           22
    Let P ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ). We put KP : = K ∩ MP and define XP,v,+ to be
the analogue of the set X+ for the triple (MP , KP , MP ∩ vHv −1 ). In particular,
XP,v,+ is an open dense subset of XP,v .
    We define the function RP,v : M1P →] 0, ∞ [ as in [14], Section 3. According
to [14], Lemma 3.2, this function is left KP - and right M1P ∩ vHv −1 -invariant.
Moreover, if P 6= G, a ∈ Aq and u ∈ NKP (aq ), then

                              RP,v (au) = max a−α .
                                            α∈Σ(P )

Finally, RP,v ≥ 1 on XP,v . The function RP,v is of importance for the description
of a domain of convergence for the series expansion that describes the asymptotic
behavior of a function from A(X+ : τ ) along (P, v). To be more precise, we define,
for 0 < r < 1,
                                                          −α
                  A+
                   P q (r): = {a ∈ AP q | ∀α ∈ ∆r (P ): a    < r}.

Then the following property, see [14], Lemma 3.3, is relevant for the mentioned
description of the domain of convergence. For m ∈ XP,v and a ∈ AP q ,
                                             −1
              m ∈ XP,v,+ , a ∈ A+
                                P q (RP,v (m)   ) ⇒ mavH ∈ X+ .

We can now describe the mentioned series expansion along (P, v), together with
a domain of convergence. According to [14], Lemma 5.3 and Thm. 3.4, a function
f ∈ A(X+ : τ ) admits a converging series expansion of the form
                               X
                    f (mav) =      aξ qξ (P, v | f, log a, m),            (6.1)
                                   ξ∈E


for m ∈ XP,v,+ and a ∈ A+     P q (RP,v (m)
                                           −1
                                              ). The set E in (6.1) is a subset of
 ∗
aP qC contained in a set of the form E0 − N∆r (P ): = E0 + (−N∆r (P )), with
E0 ⊂ a∗P qC finite. In addition, there exists a k ∈ N such that, for every ξ ∈ E,
the expression qξ (P, v | f ) belongs to Pk (aP q , C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )), the space of
polynomial functions aP q → C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP ) of degree at most k. Here τP
stands for τ |KP .
    The series on the right-hand side of (6.1) converges neatly in the sense of
[14], Def. 1.2, for each m ∈ XP,v,+ , and for a in the indicated range (depending
on m). The functions qξ are uniquely determined by these properties.
    The set of ξ ∈ E for which qξ (P, v | f ) 6= 0 is called the set of exponents
of f along (P, v), and denoted by Exp (P, v | f ). We agree to write qξ = 0 for
ξ ∈ a∗P qC \ E.
                                                                       hyp
    Using the above terminology we shall introduce the space EQ            (X : τ ) in a
number of steps. First, following [14], Def. 12.1, we introduce a suitable space
of meromorphic families of spherical functions. We agree to write P0 for the
standard minimal σ-parabolic subgroup. An index or superscript P0 will be
replaced by 0. In particular, X0,v = XP0 ,v and τ0 = τP0 . Note that X0,v = XP,v
and τ0 = τP for every P ∈ Pσmin .


                                          23
Definition 6.1 Let Q ∈ Pσ and let Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC be a finite subset. We define
                                    ep,hyp
                                   CQ,Y    (X+ : τ )                                  (6.2)

to be the space of functions f : a∗QqC ×X+ → Vτ , meromorphic in the first variable,
for which there exist a constant k ∈ N, a Σr (Q)-hyperplane configuration H in
a∗QqC and a function d: H → N such that the following conditions are fulfilled.
 (a) The function λ 7→ fλ belongs to M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (X+ : τ )).

 (b) For every P ∈ Pσmin and v ∈ NK (aq ) there exist (necessarily unique)
     functions qs,ξ (P, v | f ) in Pk (aq ) ⊗ M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (X0,v : τ0 )), for s ∈
     W/WQ and ξ ∈ −sWQ Y + N∆(P ), with the following property. For all
     λ ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H, m ∈ X0,v and a ∈ A+      q (P ),
                      X                      X
      fλ (mav) =              asλ−ρP                      a−ξ qs,ξ (P, v | f, log a)(λ, m),
                     s∈W/WQ            ξ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )
                                                                           (6.3)
      where the ∆(P )-exponential polynomial series with coefficients in Vτ con-
      verges neatly on A+
                        q (P ).

 (c) For every P ∈ Pσmin , v ∈ NK (aq ) and s ∈ W/WQ , the series
                              X
                                         a−ξ qs,ξ (P, v | f, log a)
                          ξ∈−sWQ Y +N∆(P )


      converges neatly on A+  q (P ), as an exponential polynomial series with co-
      efficients in the space M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (X0,v : τ0 )).
Finally, we define
                        C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ): = CPep,hyp
                                                 0 ,{0}
                                                        (X+ : τ ).                    (6.4)

Remark 6.2 If Q′ ∈ Pσ and aQ′ q = aQq , then Σr (Q) ⊂ Σr (Q′ ) ∪ [−Σr (Q′ )].
Hence, the notions of Σr (Q)- and Σr (Q′ )-configuration coincide. It follows that
the space (6.2) depends on Q through its σ-split component aQq .
    It is sufficient to require conditions (b) and (c) either for all P ∈ Pσmin and
a fixed v, or for a fixed P ∈ Pσmin and all v in a choice of representatives for
W/WK∩H in NK (aq ); see [14], Rem. 7.2, for details.
              ep,hyp
    If f ∈ CQ,Y      (X+ : τ ), then following [14], Def. 12.4, we define the asymp-
totic degree of f, denoted dega (f ), to be the smallest integer k for which there
exist H, d such that the conditions of Definition 6.1 are fulfilled. Moreover, we
denote by Hf the smallest Σr (Q)-configuration in a∗QqC such that the conditions
of Definition 6.1 are fulfilled with k = dega (f ) and for some d: Hf → N. We de-
note by df the -minimal map Hf → N for which the conditions of the definition
are fulfilled with H = Hf and k = dega f. Finally, we put rega (f ): = a∗QqC \ ∪Hf .
    We extend aq to a Cartan subspace b of q; clearly, b is θ-stable. If µ ∈ b∗C ,
then Iµ : = ker γ( · : µ) is an ideal of codimension one in D(X).

                                           24
    If P ∈ Pσ , we write DP for the set of finitely supported maps δ: ∗ b∗P C → N,
see (2.6). For δ ∈ DP and λ ∈ a∗P qC we define the ideal Iδ,λ in D(X) by
                                       Y       δ(Λ)
                              Iδ,λ : =        IΛ+λ .
                                           Λ∈supp δ

This ideal is cofinite, since it is a product of finitely generated cofinite ideals.
   Following [14], Def. 12.8, we introduce the following space of meromorphic
families of D(X)-finite functions.
Definition 6.3 Let Q ∈ Pσ and δ ∈ DQ . Then for Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset
we define
                            hyp
                           EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ)
                                     ep,hyp
to be the space of functions f ∈ CQ,Y       (X+ : τ ) such that, for all λ ∈ a∗QqC \ Hf ,
the function fλ : x 7→ f (λ, x) is annihilated by the cofinite ideal Iδ,λ .
    Finally, we define
                       E0hyp (X+ : τ : δ): = EPhyp
                                                0 ,{0}

    Following [14], Def. 12.8, we introduce the following subspace of meromor-
phic families of D(X)-finite functions in C ∞ (X+ : τ ) satisfying a certain addi-
tional assumption. Let Pσ1 be the collection of parabolic subgroups P ∈ Pσ
whose σ-split component aP q has codimension one in aq .
Definition 6.4 Let Q ∈ Pσ . Then for δ ∈ DQ and Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset
             hyp                                                   hyp
we define EQ,Y   (X+ : τ : δ)glob to be the space of families f ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ)
satisfying the following condition.
      For every s ∈ W, every P ∈ Pσ1 with saQq 6⊂ aP q and all v ∈ NK (aq ),
      there exists an open dense subset Ω of rega f with the following property.
      For every λ ∈ Ω, every ξ ∈ sλ|aP q + WP sWQ Y |aP q − ρP − N∆r (P ) and
      all X ∈ aP q , the function m 7→ qξ (P, v | fλ , X, m), originally defined on
      XP,v,+ , extends smoothly to all of XP,v .
Remark 6.5 In [14], Def. 9.5 and Def. 8.4, a family f satisfying the property
stated in the above display was said to be [s]-global along (P, v).
Definition 6.6 Let Q ∈ Pσ . For δ ∈ DQ and Y ⊂ ∗ a∗Qq a finite subset,
             hyp                                              hyp
we define EQ,Y   (X : τ : δ) to be the space of families f ∈ EQ,Y (X+ : τ : δ)glob
satisfying the following condition.
      For all ν in the complement of a locally finite union of analytic null-sets,
      the function fν , initially defined on X+ , extends to a smooth function on

Remark 6.7 One readily verifies that the space EQ,Y    (X : τ : δ) depends on Q
through its split component aQq . See also Remark 6.2.
Remark 6.8 If G has compact center modulo H, then aGq = {0}. Therefore,

the map f 7→ f0 defines an embedding of EG          (X : δ) into A(X : τ ), the space of

D(X)-finite functions in C (X : τ ). We claim that this map is in fact a bijection.
To see this, let g ∈ A(X : τ ). Then by [3], Thm. 5.3, the family f : a∗GqC × X → Vτ

before Definition 6.3, let S be the set of Λ ∈ ∗ b∗GC = b∗C such that D(X)g has a
non-trivial subspace on which D(X) acts by the character γ( · : Λ). Then there

Proof: This follows by using condition (a) of Definition 6.1 and applying
Cor. 18.2 of [14].                                                     

Remark 6.10 Let δ ∈ DQ and let Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC be a finite subset. It can
                                     hyp
be shown that every family f ∈ EQ,Y      (X+ : τ : δ) that satisfies the displayed

     hyp
to EQ (X : τ ). In case max δ ≤ 1, this follows from [5], Thm. 12.8. For general
δ ∈ DQ one may proceed along similar lines, see also [42], Chapter 4. However,
we shall not need such a result in the present paper, since in all cases where we
could apply it, the property of Definition 6.4 has already been established in
[14] for the functions involved. The present remark justifies the notation used.
   The following special case of the vanishing theorem of [14] will play an im-
portant role in the rest of this paper.
Theorem 6.11 (Vanishing theorem) Let Q ∈ Pσ be standard and let Q W ⊂
                                                                   hyp
NK (aq ) be a choice of representatives for WQ \W/WK∩H . Let f ∈ EQ    (X : τ )
and assume that there exists a non-empty open subset Ω ⊂ rega f such that, for
each v ∈ Q W,
                       qν−ρP (P, v | fν ) = 0,  (ν ∈ Ω).
Then f = 0.
Proof: This is a special case of [14], Thm. 12.10.                                   
   We shall often use the vanishing theorem in combination with the following
lemma to relate families of eigenfunctions.
Lemma 6.12 Let P, Q ∈ Pσ , let s ∈ W be such that saP q = aQq and assume
          hyp
that f ∈ EP,Y (X : τ ), with Y ⊂ ∗ a∗P qC a finite subset. Then the family f s : a∗QqC ×

                             hyp
a δ ∈ DP such that f ∈ EP,Y      (X : τ : δ). By Lemma 3.7 there exists a s̃ ∈ W (b)
such that s = s̃|aq . The element s̃ maps ∗ bP C onto ∗ bQC . Let s̃∗ denote its
transpose ∗ b∗QC → ∗ b∗P C . Then δ ◦ s̃∗ ∈ DQ . Moreover, one readily checks from

the definitions that f s ∈ EQ,sY   (X : τ : δ ◦ s̃∗ ).                            


7    Meromorphy of asymptotic expansions
                             hyp
Let f belong to the space EQ     (X : τ ), defined in Definition 6.6. The mentioned
definition refers back to Definition 6.1, according to which, for v ∈ NK (aq ) and
for P a minimal group in Pσ , the function fν admits an expansion along (P, v)
that depends meromorphically on the parameter ν ∈ a∗QqC in a well defined
sense. It follows from [14] that an analogous result holds for arbitrary P ∈ Pσ .
For its formulation, we need a particular type of subset of the symmetric space
XP,v . For 1 ≤ R ≤ ∞, we define the set
                     XP,v,+ [R]: = {x ∈ XP,v,+ | RP,v (x) < R};
see [14], Eqn. (3.7) for details.
    We also need an equivalence relation ∼P |Q on W to describe asymptotic
exponents along (P, v) without redundance. The relation is defined by
                    s ∼P |Q t ⇐⇒ ∀ν ∈ a∗Qq : sν|aP q = tν|aP q .                    (7.1)
If Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC is a finite subset and σ ∈ W/∼P |Q , we put
                           σ · Y : = {sη|aP q | s ∈ σ, η ∈ Y };
see [14], § 6, for details. We recall from [14], Lemma 6.5, that W/∼P |Q ≃ W/WQ ,
if P ∈ Pσmin and Q ∈ Pσ .
Proposition 7.1 Let Q ∈ Pσ , δ ∈ DQ and Y ⊂ ∗ a∗Qq a finite subset. Let f be
              ep,hyp
a family in CQ,Y     (X+ : τ ) and put k = dega f.
    Let P ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ). Then Exp (P, v | fν ) ⊂ W (ν + Y )|aP q − ρP −
N∆r (P ), for every ν ∈ rega f. Moreover, there exist unique functions
         qσ,ξ (P, v | f ) ∈ Pk (aP q ) ⊗ M(a∗QqC , Hf , df , C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP )),
for σ ∈ W/∼P |Q and ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ), such that, for every ν ∈ rega f,
                 X                 X
    fν (mav) =          aσν−ρP                a−ξ qξ (P, v | f, log a)(ν, m),

series in the variable a with coefficients in Vτ is neatly convergent in the in-
dicated range. In particular, for all ν in an open dense subset of a∗QqC and all
σ ∈ W/∼P |Q and ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (P ),
     qσ,ξ (P, v | f )(X, ν) = qσν|aP q −ρP −ξ (P, v | fν , X),     (X ∈ aP q ).     (7.2)

coefficients in M(aQqC , C (XP,v,+ [R] : τP ).

Proof: This follows from [14], Thm. 7.7 and Lemma 12.7.                              
    The following result is based on the meromorphic nature of the series in the
above proposition. It may be considered a natural companion to [14], Lemma
7.9.

Lemma 7.2 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset and f ∈ CQ,Y       (X+ : τ ).
Let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ). Assume that for every σ ∈ W/ ∼P |Q a set Eσ ⊂
−σ · Y + N∆r (P ) is given such that, for ν in a non-empty open subset Ω of
rega f,                             [
                Exp (P, v | fν ) ⊂         σν|aP q − ρP − Eσ .           (7.3)
                                     σ∈W/∼P |Q

Then (7.3) holds for every ν ∈ reg f.

Proof: Let σ0 ∈ W/∼P |Q and ξ ∈ −σ0 · Y + N∆r (P ) be such that qσ0 ,ξ (P, v |
f ) 6= 0. By Proposition 7.1 there exists an open dense subset Ω ⊂ rega f such
that, for all ν ∈ Ω, (7.2) is valid. In particular, it follows that, for ν ∈ Ω,
σ0 ν|aP q −ρP −ξ ∈ Exp (P, v | fν ); hence, σ0 ν|aP q −ρP −ξ belongs to the union on
the right-hand side of (7.3). By [14], Lemma 6.2, the sets σν|aP q +σ·Y −N∆r (P ),
for σ ∈ W/∼P |Q , are mutually disjoint, for ν in an open dense subset Ω′ of Ω.
It follows that ξ ∈ Eσ0 .
     From the above and Proposition 7.1 we conclude that for all σ ∈ W/∼P |Q
and ξ ∈ (−σ · Y + N∆r (P )) \ Eσ , the meromorphic function ν 7→ qσ,ξ (P, v | f, ν)
is zero. Hence, for ν ∈ rega f,
                     X                 X
       fν (mav) =            aσν−ρP        a−ξ qσ,ξ (P, v | f )(log a, ν, m),   (7.4)
                  σ∈W/∼P |Q              ξ∈Eσ


for m ∈ XP,v,+ and a ∈ A+   P q (RP,v (m)

                                            ). Thus, the inclusion (7.3) holds for
ν ∈ rega f. It remains to extend the domain of its validity to all of reg f.
    Let R ≥ 1. Then for each σ ∈ W/∼P |Q , the series

coefficients in the space M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R] : τP )); here H = Hf and
d = df .

    Let ν0 ∈ a∗QqC be such that the meromorphic C ∞ (X+ : τ )-valued function
ν 7→ fν is regular at ν0 . Let H(ν0 ) be the collection of H ∈ H that con-
tain ν0 . Since H is a Σr (Q)-configuration in a∗QqC , the collection H(ν0 ) is finite
and there exists a bounded open neighborhood ω of ν0 in reg (f ) such that
H(ν0 ) = {H ∈ H | H ∩ ω 6= ∅}. Put π = πω,d , see (4.3). Then ϕ 7→ πϕ|ω
defines a continuous linear map from M(a∗QqC , H, d, C ∞ (XP,v,+ [P ] : τP )) into
O(a∗QqC , C ∞ (XP,v,+ [R] : τP )). In particular, the series (7.5) multiplied with π
converges neatly on A+   P q (R

                       ∞
in the space O(ω, C (XP,v,+ [R] : τP )).
    It follows from [14], Lemma 10.5, that there exists a u ∈ S(a∗Qq ), such that
ϕ(ν0 ) = u(πϕ)(ν0 ), for ϕ ∈ O(ω). We apply this to ν 7→ fν . Then,

 f (ν0 , mav)   = u[π( · )f ( · , mav)](ν0 )

with finitely many pσ,j ∈ P (aP q ) and Uσ,j ∈ S(a∗Qq ), as is readily seen by
application of the Leibniz rule. Note that deg pσ,j + order(Uσ,j ) ≤ l: = order(u).
     From [14], Lemma 1.10, we obtain that the elements Uσ,j ∈ S(a∗Qq ), viewed
as constant coefficient differential operators in the variable ν, may be applied
termwise to the series for π( · )Fσ (a)( · , m), without disturbing the nature of the
convergence of the series. This leads to the existence of polynomial functions
q̄σ,ξ ∈ Pk+l (aP q ) ⊗ C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP ), for σ ∈ W/∼P |Q , ξ ∈ Eσ , such that
                                 X                 X
               fν0 (mav) =               aσν0 −ρP     a−ξ q̄σ,ξ (log a, m),

for a ∈ A+ P q (R
                  −1
                     ) and m ∈ XP,v,+ [R]. The series on the right-hand side con-
verges neatly as a ∆r (P )-exponential polynomial series on A+  P q (R
                                                                       −1

                 ∞
efficients in C (XP,v,+ [R] : τP ). It follows that the inclusion (7.3) is valid for
ν = ν0 .                                                                           


8     Fourier inversion
In this section we recall the Fourier inversion formula from [12] that will be the
starting point for the derivation of the spherical Plancherel formula.
    Let W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a choice of representatives for W/WK∩H . This choice
determines the space ◦ C = ◦ C(τ ), defined as the formal Hilbert direct sum of
finite dimensional Hilbert spaces
                             M
                      ◦
                        C: =     C ∞ (M/M ∩ vHv −1 : τ0 ),                   (8.1)
                             v∈W

where τ0 denotes the restriction of τ to K0 : = K ∩ M. Given P ∈ Pσmin, and
ψ ∈ ◦ C, we define the normalized Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P : ψ) as in [9], § 5. This

                                            29
Eisenstein integral is a meromorphic C ∞ (X : τ )-valued function on a∗qC , which
depends linearly on ψ. It naturally arises in representation theory, essentially
as a sum of matrix coefficients of the minimal principal series of X. However, it
can also be characterized by some of its analytic properties, as follows.
Proposition 8.1 Let P ∈ Pσmin and ψ ∈ ◦ C. The function ν →      7 E ◦ (P : ψ : ν)
                         hyp
is the unique family in EP (X : τ ) with the following property. For each v ∈ W
and for ν in a dense open subset of a∗qC ,
                    qν−ρP (P, v | E ◦ (P : ψ : ν), · , m) = ψv (m).
Here qν−ρP is the coefficient in the expansion (6.1) for f = E ◦ (P : ψ : ν).
Remark 8.2 It is implicit in the above formulation that the function on the
left-hand side of the above equation is constant as a polynomial function of the
variable indicated by the dot. It is known that for ν in a dense open subset of
a∗qC , there are no terms with log a in the expansion (6.1) with f = E ◦ (P : ψ : ν);
see [10], Thm. 7.5.
Proof: Uniqueness follows from the vanishing theorem, Thm. 6.11. Thus, it
suffices to show that, for ψ ∈ ◦ C, the C ∞ (X : τ )-valued meromorphic function
f : ν 7→ E ◦ (ψ : ν) on a∗qC satisfies the properties mentioned above. By linearity
with respect to ψ we may assume that ψ ∈ ◦ C[Λ], for some Λ ∈ ib∗k = i∗ b∗P , in the
notation of [14], text preceding Lemma 14.3. It now follows from [14], Lemma
14.5, that f ∈ EPhyp (X+ : τ : δΛ )glob , where δΛ is the characteristic function of the
subset {Λ} of ∗ b∗P C . Finally, it follows from [9], beginning of Sect. 5, that ν 7→ fν
is a C ∞ (X : τ )-valued meromorphic function on a∗qC . Therefore, f ∈ EPhyp (X : τ ).
     Combining [9], Eqns. (49), (45) and the display following the latter equation,
we finally obtain that
     qν−ρP (P, v | fν : · : m) = [pP |P,0 (1 : ν)CP |P (1 : ν)−1 ψ]v (m) = ψv (m),
for each v ∈ W and all m ∈ M.                                                        

Lemma 8.3 Let P ∈ Pσmin and ψ ∈ ◦ C. Let f be the family in EPhyp (X : τ )
defined by fν = E ◦ (P : ψ : ν), for ν ∈ a∗qC . Then the Σ(P )-configuration Hf ,
defined as in the text preceding Definition 6.3, is real.
Proof: In view of [14], Eqn. (14.12), it suffices to prove a similar statement
for the function f of [14], Lemma 14.3. We observe that in the proof of the
mentioned lemma, Hf is shown to be contained in a Σ(P )-configuration H′′ .
This configuration is given as H′′ = t−1 H ∪ H′ with t ∈ W. Now H is real by
[14], Cor. 14.2. It therefore remains to show that H′ is real. For this it suffices
to show that the singular locus of the normalized C-function CP◦ |P (t : · ) is the
union of a real Σ-configuration. By [14], Eqn. (14.6), it suffices to show that
the singular loci of CP |P (1 : · )−1 and CP |P (t : · ) are likewise. In view of [5],
Cor. 15.5, it suffices to show that the functions CQ|P (1 : · )±1 , for Q ∈ Pσmin, all
have a singular locus equal to the union of a real Σ-configuration. The latter
assertion follows by the argument following the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [12]. 

                       E ◦ (P : ν : x)ψ = E ◦ (P : ψ : ν : x),

for x ∈ X, ψ ∈ ◦ C and generic ν ∈ a∗qC . Following [12], Eqn. (2.3), we define
the dualized Eisenstein integral as the C ∞ (X, Hom(Vτ , ◦ C))-valued meromorphic
function on a∗qC given by

                        E ∗ (P : ν : x): = E ◦ (P : −ν̄ : x)∗ .

Finally, we introduce the partial Eisenstein integrals E+,s (P : · ), for s ∈ W, as
in [12], Eqn. (2.9), see also [14], Eqn. (14.11). Let 1 ⊗ τ denote the natural
representation of K in Hom(◦ C, Vτ ) ≃ ◦ C ∗ ⊗ Vτ . Then the partial Eisenstein
integrals are meromorphic C ∞ (X+ : 1 ⊗ τ )-valued functions on a∗qC . Moreover,
for ν ∈ a∗qC a regular point, the partial Eisenstein integral E+,s (P : ν) is D(X)-
finite. By [14], Lemma 5.3, it therefore has converging expansions like (6.1), but
with qξ (Q, v | E+,s (P : ν)) a C ∞ (XQ,v,+ : 1 ⊗ τ )-valued polynomial function on
aQq ; see [14], Def. 2.1, for details. The exponents of the partial Eisenstein
integrals are restricted by

                  Exp (P, v | E+,s (P : ν)) ⊂ sλ − ρP − N∆(P ),

for all v ∈ W. Finally, according to [14], Eqn. (165),
                                  X
                    E ◦ (P : ν) =     E+,s (P : ν) on         X+ .
                                  s∈W

The mentioned properties determine the partial Eisenstein integrals completely,
see [14], Lemma 2.2.
    We shall now investigate the dependence of the Eisenstein integrals on the
choice of W. To this purpose, let 8 W be a second choice of representatives for
W/WK∩H in NK (aq ). We denote by 8◦ C the associated space define by (8.1),
with 8 W in place of W. The associated Eisenstein and partial Eisenstein integrals
are similarly indicated with a backprime.

Lemma 8.4 There exists a unique linear map R: ◦ C → 8◦ C such that

                       E ◦ (P : ν : x) = 8 E ◦ (P : ν : x) ◦ R,              (8.2)

for all x ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗qC . The map R is an isometric isomorphism.

Proof: For every w ∈ W, let 8 w denote the unique element of 8 W that represents
the same class in W/WK∩H . Then for every w ∈ W we may select an element
lw ∈ K0 such that 8 w ∈ lw wNK∩H (aq ). The right regular action Rlw : C ∞ (M ) →
C ∞ (M ) induces a linear isomorphism Rw from C ∞ (M/M ∩ wHw−1 : τ0 ) onto
C ∞ (M/M ∩ 8 wH 8 w−1 : τ0 ). Let R: ◦ C → 8◦ C be the direct sum of the isomor-
phisms Rw , for w ∈ W. Then obviously R is an isometry. Let ψ ∈ ◦ C. Then


                                          31
by Proposition 8.1 the map g: ν 7→ 8 E ◦ (P : ν : x) ◦ Rψ belongs to EPhyp (X : τ ).
Moreover, it follows from the same proposition that

                      qν−ρP (P, 8 w | gν , · , m) = (Rψ)8 w (m),               (8.3)

for ν ∈ rega (g), w ∈ W and m ∈ M. Also, by the definition of R,

                             (Rψ)8 w (m) = ψw (mlw ),                          (8.4)

for each w ∈ W and all m ∈ M.
    On the other hand, still by Proposition 8.1, the map f : ν 7→ E ◦ (P : ν : x)ψ
belongs to EPhyp (X : τ ) as well, and for ν ∈ rega (f ), w ∈ W and m ∈ M,

                        qν−ρP (P, w | fν , · , m) = ψw (m).

This equation remains valid if we replace w in the expression on the left-hand
side by any element w̄ of wNK∩H (aq ), see [14], Lemma 3.7. Now 8 w = lw w̄,
for some w̄ ∈ wNK∩H (aq ); hence, applying [14], Lemma 3.6, with v = w̄ and
u = lw , we obtain that

                       qν−ρP (P, 8 w | fν , · , m) = ψw (mlw ).                (8.5)

Comparing (8.5) with (8.3) and (8.4) and applying the uniqueness statement of
Proposition 8.1, we infer that f = g. On the other hand, if R: ◦ C → 8◦ C is a
linear map such that (8.2) is valid, then f = g, hence (8.3) and (8.5) are equal.
This implies (8.4) and shows that R is uniquely determined by the requirement
(8.2).                                                                         

Lemma 8.5 Let P ∈ Pσmin and s ∈ W. Then, for all x ∈ X+ , y ∈ X and
generic ν ∈ a∗qC , the element

                     E+,s (P : ν : x)E ∗ (P : ν : y) ∈ End(Vτ )                (8.6)

does not depend on the choice of W made in the text preceding (8.1).

Proof: Let R be the isometry of Lemma 8.4. From the fact that the partial
Eisenstein integrals are uniquely determined by the properties mentioned in the
text above Lemma 8.4, it follows that they satisfy the transformation property
(8.2) with on both sides E ◦ replaced by E+,s , for s ∈ W. See also [14], Lemma
2.2.
    On the other hand, taking adjoints of the homomorphisms on both sides of
(8.2), and substituting −ν̄ for ν, we obtain that

                       E ∗ (P : ν : x) = R∗ ◦ 8 E ∗ (P : ν : x),

for all x ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗qC . From the unitarity of R it now follows that
the endomorphism (8.6) does not change if we replace E+,s and E ∗ by 8 E+,s
and 8 E ∗ , respectively.                                                     

                                          32
    In the following we consider Eisenstein integrals associated with the standard
parabolic subgroup P0 ∈ Pσmin , but suppress the symbol P0 in the notation.
Moreover, we agree to write E+ for E+,1 . We recall from [12], p. 41, that the
meromorphic functions ν 7→ E ◦ (ν) and ν 7→ E+ (ν) have singular sets that
are locally finite unions of real Σ-hyperplanes in a∗qC . Let H be the collection
of the singular hyperplanes for E ◦ ( · ) and E+ ( · ). Let t ∈ WT(Σ) be a W -
invariant even residue weight, see the text following (2.1). Associated with the
data Σ+ , t, we define, for each subset F ⊂ ∆ and every element λ ∈ ∗ a∗F qC , the
residue operator Restλ+a∗F q as in § 5, with respect to the normalization of the
Lebesgue measures dλ of a∗q and dµF of a∗F q given at the end of that section.
    The data Σ+ , F and H determine a finite subset Λ(F ) of −R+ F, the negative
of the closed cone spanned by F, see [12], Eqn. (5.1), where between the set
brackets the requirement ‘for some t’ should be added. We now recall, from
[12], Eqn. (5.7), the definition of the kernel KFt (ν : x : y) ∈ End(Vτ ), for (x, y) ∈
X+ × X and generic ν ∈ a∗F qC , by
                                                                      !
                    X                   X
    t                         t                              ∗
 KF (ν : x : y) =         Resλ+a∗F q        E+ (s · : x) ◦ E (s · : y) (λ + ν). (8.7)
                  λ∈Λ(F )                  s∈W F

From the definition it follows that ν 7→ KFt (ν : · : · ) is a meromorphic function
on a∗F qC with values in the space C ∞ (X+ × X : τ ⊗ τ ∗ ) and with singularities
along the hyperplanes of a real Σr (F )-configuration. Here τ ⊗ τ ∗ denotes the
tensor product representation of K × K in End(Vτ ) ≃ Vτ ⊗ Vτ∗ .
    The residue operators in (8.7) depend on the choices of dλ and dµF , see the
discussion in § 5; therefore, so does the kernel KFt .

Lemma 8.6 Let the data (G, H, K, τ, aq , Σ+ ) be fixed as above. Let F ⊂ ∆
and let t ∈ WT(Σ) be a W -invariant even residue weight. These data completely
determine KFt dµF dy, the product of the kernel KFt , defined by (8.7), with the
product measure dµF dy on ia∗F q × X.
    In particular, KFt dµF dy is independent of the particular choice of W, made
in the text preceding (8.1), and of the choices of B and dy, made in Sections 2
and 5.

Proof: Put                          X
                      kF ( · ) =           E+ (s · : x) ◦ E ∗ (s · : y).
                                   s∈W F

It follows from Lemma 8.5 that kF depends only on the data mentioned, and
not on W, B, dy. Moreover, from (8.7) and (5.4), it follows that
                                    X
            KFt (ν : x : y)dµF dy =    Restλ+a∗F q (kF (· + ν))(dλ)dy.
                                      λ∈Λ(F )

The occurring residue operators only depend on the data mentioned, and the
product measure dλ dy only depends on the choice of (G, H, K, aq ), by the dis-
cussion in § 5. All assertions now follow.                                   

                                              33
Remark 8.7 Since dµF and dy do not depend on the choice of W, it follows
that the same holds for the kernel KFt . This fact has already silently been
exploited in [12], text below Lemma 8.1, where the choice of W is adapted to
the set F.

    According to [12], Cor. 10.10, the kernel KFt (ν : x : y) extends smoothly to all
of X in the variable x; more precisely, KFt is a meromorphic C ∞ (X×X, End(Vτ ))-
valued function on a∗F qC with singularities along real Σr (F )-hyperplanes.
    From [12], Eqn. (5.5) and (5.8), we recall the definition of the linear operator
TFt from Cc∞ (X : τ ) to C ∞ (X+ : τ ) by
                               Z        Z
      TFt f (x) = |W | t(a+
                          Fq )             KFt (ν : x : y)f (y) dy dµF (ν),    (8.8)
                              εF +ia∗
                                    Fq    X


for f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) and x ∈ X+ . Here dµF is the translate by εF of the Lebesgue
measure on ia∗F q normalized as in Section 5. Moreover, εF is a point in the
chamber a+ F q , arbitrary but sufficiently close to the origin.

Remark 8.8 If G has compact center modulo H, then a∆q = {0} and t(a+      ∆q ) =
1. Moreover, the above is to be understood so that integration relative to dµ∆
                                                                     t
means evaluation in 0; also, ε∆ = 0. In this case we agree to write K∆ (x : y) =
  t                                       t
K∆ (0 : x : y), so that the formula for T∆ becomes
                                        Z
                         t                   t
                        T∆ f (x) = |W |     K∆ (x : y) f (y) dy             (8.9)
                                          X

for f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) and x ∈ X+ .

    In [12], Cor. 10.11, it is shown that in fact TFt maps into C ∞ (X : τ ) and
defines a continuous linear operator Cc∞ (X : τ ) → C ∞ (X : τ ). Moreover, by
[12], Thm. 1.2, it follows that
                               X
                          I=       TFt on Cc∞ (X : τ ).                   (8.10)
                              F ⊂∆

Lemma 8.9 Let (G, H, K, τ, aq , Σ+ ) and (F, t) be data as in Lemma 8.6. These
data determine the operator TFt , defined by (8.8), completely.

Proof: This follows from Lemma 8.6.                                                
    We finish this section with a discussion of how the kernels        KFt
                                                                         and the
operators TFt behave under isomorphisms of reductive symmetric spaces.
    Let ϕ: G → 8 G be an isomorphism of reductive groups of Harish-Chandra’s
class, and put 8 H = ϕ(H), 8 K = ϕ(K), 8 τ : = τ ◦ ϕ−1 , 8 aq = ϕ(aq ). Let 8 Σ be
the root system of 8 aq in 8 g and let 8 W denote the associated Weyl group. The
isomorphism ϕ naturally induces the linear isomorphism a∗qC → 8 a∗qC given by

                               ν 7→ 8 ν: = ν ◦ ϕ−1 |8 aq .

                                           34
This isomorphism restricts to an isomorphism of root systems Σ → 8 Σ. Let Σ+
be a positive system for Σ and 8 Σ+ the corresponding positive system for 8 Σ.
Let ∆ and 8 ∆ be the collections of simple roots for Σ+ and 8 Σ+ , respectively.
We denote by 8 F the image in 8 ∆ of a subset F ⊂ ∆.
     The map ϕ also naturally induces a bijection from WT(Σ) onto WT(8 Σ),
which we denote by t 7→ 8 t. If t ∈ WT(Σ) is W -invariant and even, then 8 t ∈
WT(8 Σ) is 8 W -invariant and even.
     We put X = G/H and 8 X = 8 G/8 H. Then the map ϕ factors to a diffeomor-
phism ϕ̄: X → 8 X. This diffeomorphism induces the isomorphism ϕ∗ : C ∞ (X : τ ) →
C ∞ (8 X : 8 τ ), given by f 7→ f ◦ ϕ̄−1 . It maps Cc∞ (X : τ ) onto Cc∞ (8 X : 8 τ ). We se-
lect invariant measures dx and 8 dx on X and 8 X, respectively. As in Section 5,
this choice determines Lebesgue measures dλ and 8 dλ on ia∗q and i8 a∗q , respec-
tively. As in Section 2 we fix bilinear forms B and 8 B on g and 8 g, respectively.
These choices determine densities dµF and dµ8 F on ia∗F q and i8 a∗8 F q , respectively.
               8
     Let K8 Ft be the analogue of the kernel KFt for the data (8 G, 8 H, 8 K, 8 τ, 8 aq , 8 Σ+ ,
                                                                                      8
8
  F, 8 t, 8 dx, 8 B) in place of (G, H, K, τ, aq , Σ+ , F, t, dx, B). Moreover, let T8 Ft be the
associated analogue of the operator TFt .

Lemma 8.10 Let notation be as above. Then
         8
       K8 Ft (8 ν : ϕ̄(x) : ϕ̄(y))ϕ∗ (dµ8 F ) ϕ̄∗ (8 dy) = KFt (ν : x : y) dµF dy,     (8.11)

for x, y ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗qC . Moreover, the corresponding operators are
related by           8
                   T8 Ft ◦ ϕ∗ = ϕ∗ ◦ TFt on    Cc∞ (X : τ ).           (8.12)

Proof: In view of Lemma 8.6 it suffices to prove the identity (8.11) in case
8
  W, 8 dx and 8 B are compatible with W, dx and B, via ϕ. It then follows from
the definition of the kernels that
                            8
                         K8 Ft (8 ν : ϕ̄(x) : ϕ̄(y)) = KFt (ν : x : y),

whence (8.11).
    Equation (8.12) now follows by combining (8.11) with (8.8) and using the
relations induced by ϕ between the data associated with G and 8 G.        


9     The generalized Eisenstein integral
In this section we shall use the vanishing theorem to give an alternative charac-
terization of the generalized Eisenstein integral defined in [12], Def. 10.7. This
characterization, which is in the spirit of Proposition 8.1, will be used through-
out the paper.
    For the moment we assume the G has compact center modulo H. Then, with
notation as in Remark 8.8, we define the space

                  At (X : τ ): = span {K∆
                                        t
                                          ( · : y)v | y ∈ X+ , v ∈ Vτ }.                (9.1)

                                              35
This space equals the space Cν of [12], Eqn. (10.2), with F = ∆ and ν = 0. It
is finite dimensional and consists of D(X)-finite functions in C ω (X : τ ), see [12],
Lemma 10.1. We adopt the new notation (9.1) in stead of Cν to avoid confusion
with the space defined by (8.1).
Lemma 9.1 Let G have compact center modulo H, and let t ∈ WT(Σ) be a
W -invariant even residue weight. Then the space At (X : τ ) equals the image
 t
T∆ (Cc∞ (X : τ )).
                                                            t
Proof: From [12], Lemma 10.2, it follows that K∆               extends to a real analytic
function X × X → End(Vτ ) ≃ Vτ ⊗ Vτ which is τ ⊗ τ ∗ -spherical.

    By density of X+ in X, continuity of K∆          and finite dimensionality of the
         t                                                                    t
space A (X : τ ), it follows that the latter contains the function K∆           ( · : y)v for
                                                                ∞
every y ∈ X and v ∈ Vτ . This implies that T∆ maps Cc (X : τ ) into At (X : τ ).
                                                  t

    To see that the converse inclusion holds, suppose that ξ is a linear functional
of At (X : τ ), vanishing on im (T∆t
                                     ). Then it suffices to show that ξ = 0.
    For every x ∈ X and η ∈ Vτ∗ , let ξx,η denote the linear functional ϕ 7→
η(ϕ(x)) on At (X : τ ). The intersection of the kernels of these linear functionals,
as x ∈ X and η ∈ Vτ∗ , is zero. Therefore, these linear functionals span the dual of
                 we see that there exist n ≥ 1, x1 , . . . , xn ∈ X and η1 , . . . , ηn ∈ Vτ∗ ,
At (X : τ ), and P
such that ξ = nj=1 ξxj ,ηj . In view of (8.9), the fact that ξ vanishes on im (T∆          t
                                                                                             )
implies that
                           Xn Z

0 as a function in C (X, Vτ ). It follows that ξ(K∆ ( · : y)v) = 0, for all y ∈ X+
and v ∈ Vτ . In view of (9.1), this implies that ξ = 0.                               
     We now assume that G is arbitrary again. Let F ⊂ ∆ and let F W ⊂ NK (aq )
be a choice of representatives for WF \W/WK∩H . If t ∈ WT(Σ) we denote by
∗
  t the induced residue weight of ΣF , see [11], Eqn. (3.16). Let t be W -invariant
and even; then ∗ t is WF -invariant and even.

     If v ∈ F W, let KFt (XF,v : m : m′ ), for m, m′ ∈ XF,v , denote the analogue
       t
of K∆    for the symmetric space XF,v . Note that MF has a compact center, so
that the discussion of the beginning of this section applies to MF in stead of
G. In particular, the data (MF , HF , KF , τF , ∗ aF q , Σ+  ∗
                                                          F , t) determine the finite
dimensional space

             A t (XF,v : τF ) = span {KFt (XF,v : · : m′ ) | m′ ∈ XF,v,+ }.
Note that this space was denoted CF,v in [12], Eqn. (10.7). We define
                                ∗                    ∗
                            AFt = ⊕v∈F W A t (XF,v : τF );                                 (9.2)
this formal direct sum was denoted CF in [12], Def. 10.7. The natural projections
and embeddings associated with the above direct sum are denoted by
                   ∗       ∗                                     ∗                   ∗

for v ∈ F W. Given ψ ∈ AFt we shall also write ψv : = prF,v ψ.
    The generalized Eisenstein integral EF◦ (ψ : ν), defined in [12], Def. 10.7, is a
                                                           ∗
function in C ∞ (X : τ ) that depends linearly on ψ ∈ AFt and meromorphically
          ∗
on ν ∈ aF qC . We shall not repeat the definition here, but instead give a charac-
terization based on the vanishing theorem, Theorem 6.11. The following result
will allow us to show that EF◦ (ψ : · ) belongs to the space of families EFhyp (X : τ )
introduced in Definition 6.6 with Q = PF . For its formulation, we recall some
notation from [12], § 8.
    In the rest of this section we write E ◦ (λ : x): = E ◦ (P0 : λ : x). Similarly, if
v ∈ F W, we write E ◦ (X1F,v : ν : m) for the normalized Eisenstein integral of
X1F,v , associated with the minimal parabolic subgroup M1F ∩ P0 . The analogue
of the space ◦ C for the latter Eisenstein integral is
                ◦
                    CF,v : = ⊕w∈WF,v C ∞ (M/M ∩ wvHv −1 w−1 : τ0 ).                (9.3)

Here WF,v ⊂ NMF ∩K (aq ) is a choice of representatives for WF /WKF ∩vHv−1 ;
see [12], Eqn. (8.2). Adapting the set W if necessary, we may assume that
WF,v ⊂ W. Then W is the disjoint union of the sets WF,v , for v ∈ F W, see [12],
Lemma 8.1. Accordingly, iF,v denotes the natural inclusion ◦ CF,v → ◦ C, defined
as the identity on each component of (9.3). Moreover,
                                 ◦
                                     C = ⊕v∈F W iF,v (◦ CF,v ).                    (9.4)

We denote the associated projection operator ◦ C → ◦ CF,v by prF,v , for v ∈ F W.

Lemma 9.2 Let L be a Laurent functional in M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur ⊗ ◦ C. Then
the family g: a∗F qC → C ∞ (X : τ ), defined by

                                 g(ν, x): = L[E ◦ (ν + · : x)]
            hyp
belongs to EF,Y (X : τ ), with Y = supp L. Moreover, if v ∈ F W, then for ν in a
dense open subset of a∗F qC ,

           qν−ρF (PF , v | gν , X, m) = L[E ◦ (X1F,v : · + ν : m) ◦ prF,v ],       (9.5)

for all X ∈ aF q and m ∈ XF,v,+ . Here prF,v denotes the projection associated
with (9.4).

Proof: It suffices to prove the result for a Laurent functional of the form
L = L′ ⊗ ψ, with L′ ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur and ψ ∈ ◦ C. Define the family f by
f (ν : x): = E ◦ (ν : x)ψ.
    It follows from [9], p. 52, Lemma 14, that there exists a locally finite col-
lection H of Σ-hyperplanes in a∗qC and a map d: H → N such that f belongs
to M(a∗qC , H, d, C ∞ (X : τ )). From [14], Lemma 13.1, applied with Q = PF , it
follows that g is a meromorphic function on a∗F qC with values in C ∞ (X : τ ).
    It follows from [14], Lemma 14.5, that there exists a δ ∈ DP such that f be-
longs to E0hyp (X+ : τ : δ)hglob , see [14], Def. 13.10, for the definition of the latter


                                                37
                                                                     hyp
space. According to [14], Thm. 13.12, this implies that g ∈ EF,Y          (X+ : τ )glob .
                         hyp
We conclude that g ∈ EF,Y (X : τ ).
    The family f equals the family fW defined in [14], Prop. 15.4. It follows
from that proposition, applied with Q = PF and with L′ in place of L, that
(9.5) holds for each v ∈ F W, generic ν ∈ a∗F qC and all X ∈ a∗F q and m ∈ XF,v,+ .
Combining this with [14], Theorem 7.7, Eqn. (7.14), we see that (9.5) holds for
all ν in a dense open subset of a∗F qC , every v ∈ F W, X ∈ a∗F q and all m ∈ XF,v,+ .

Theorem 9.3 Let ψ ∈ AFt . Then g: ν 7→ EF◦ (ψ : ν) is the unique family in
EFhyp (X : τ ) with the following property. For all ν in some non-empty open subset
of a∗F qC and each u ∈ F W,

      qν−ρF (PF , u | gν )(X, m) = ψu (m),            (X ∈ aF q , m ∈ XF,v,+ ).        (9.6)

Remark 9.4 If F = ∆ and G has compact center modulo H, then aF q = {0}
and f 7→ f0 defines a bijection from EFhyp (X : τ ) onto A(X : τ ), the space of
D(X)-finite functions in C ∞ (X : τ ), see Remark 6.8. Moreover, F W consists of
                                                                 ∗
one element which one may take to be 1, MF /MF ∩H ≃ X, and AFt ≃ At (X : τ ).
Finally, with notation as in the above theorem, g0 = ψ, so that ψ 7→ EF◦ (ψ : 0)
is the inclusion map At (X : τ ) → A(X : τ ).

Remark 9.5 In the proof of Theorem 9.3, we will encounter the set

                                     Λ(XF,v , F ) ⊂ −R+ F,                             (9.7)

which is defined to be the analogue of the set Λ(∆) of (8.7), for the data
(XF,v , ∗ aF q , Σ+                         +
                  F ) in place of (X, aq , Σ ).

Proof: Uniqueness follows from the vanishing theorem, Theorem 6.11; hence,
it suffices to prove existence.
                                                     ∗
    In view of (9.2), we may assume that ψ ∈ A t (XF,v : τF ) for some v ∈ F W.
According to [12], Eqn. (10.9), we may then express ψ as follows
                  X          ∗
    ψ(m) =                Resλt [E ◦ (XF,v : − · : m)Φ( · )], (m ∈ XF,v ), (9.8)
              λ∈Λ(XF,v ,F )

where

                     j=1

with {m1 , . . . , mk } a finite subset of XF,v,+ , and {v1 , . . . , vk } a finite subset of
Vτ . We now note that                       X           ∗
                                 RF : =              Resλt                              (9.9)

is a Laurent functional in M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur ; moreover, according to [12], Def.
10.7, the generalized Eisenstein integral is given by

                     g(ν, x) = RF [E ◦ (ν − · : x) ◦ iF,v Φ( · )].

Define the Laurent functional L0 ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur ⊗ ◦ C by

                          L0 ϕ: = RF [ϕ(− · ) ◦ iF,v Φ( · )],                     (9.10)

for ϕ ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF ) ⊗ ◦ C ∗ . Then the generalized Eisenstein integral is given
by
                             g(ν, x) = L0 [E ◦ (ν + · : x)].
It now follows from Lemma 9.2 that g ∈ EFhyp (X : τ ) and that, for ν in an open
dense subset of a∗F qC and all X ∈ aF q and m ∈ XF,v,+ ,

   qν−ρF (PF , u | gν , X, m) =     L0 [E ◦ (XF,v : ν + · : m) ◦ prF,u ]
                              =     RF [E ◦ (XF,v : ν − · : m) ◦ prF,u ◦ iF,v Φ( · (9.11)
                                                                                   )].

If u 6= v, then the latter expression equals 0. Since also ψu = 0, the identity
(9.6) then follows. On the other hand, if u = v, then prF,u ◦ iF,v Φ( · ) = Φ( · );
hence, (9.11) equals the expression on the right-hand side of (9.8), and since
ψv = ψ, the identity (9.6) follows.                                             

Corollary 9.6 There exists a locally finite collection H0 of hyperplanes in a∗F qC
                                         ∗
such that the following holds. Let ψ ∈ AFt and let g be defined as in Theorem
9.3. Then the meromorphic function ν 7→ gν is regular on the complement of
∪H0 . Moreover, for every u ∈ F W, X ∈ aF q and m ∈ XF,v,+ , formula (9.6)
holds for all ν ∈ a∗F qC \ ∪H0 .

Proof: Let 1̄ denote the image of 1 in W/∼PF |PF , see (7.1). Let

                           ν 7→ q1̄,0 (PF , u | g)(ν, X, m)                       (9.12)

be the function in M(a∗F qC , Σr (F ), Vτ ), defined as in Proposition 7.1. By [14],
Thm. 7.7, there exists a locally finite collection H0 of hyperplanes in a∗F qC such
that ν 7→ gν is regular on a∗F qC \ ∪H0 and for every u ∈ F W, all X ∈ aF q and
m ∈ XF,u,+ ,

               q1̄,0 (PF , u | g)(ν, X, m) = qν−ρF (PF , u | gν , X, m),          (9.13)

for all ν ∈ a∗F qC \ ∪H0 . By linearity in ψ and finite dimensionality of the space
  ∗
AFt , the collection H0 can be chosen independent of ψ. Combination of (9.13)
and (9.6) gives that the meromorphic function (9.12) is constant and equal
to ψu (m). In view of (9.13) it now follows that (9.6) holds for all X ∈ aF q ,
m ∈ XF,u,+ and ν ∈ a∗F qC \ ∪H0 .                                                

to write EF (ν : x)ψ: = EF (ψ : ν : x), for x ∈ X and generic ν ∈ aF qC . Accord-
ingly, we view the generalized Eisenstein integral as a meromorphic function on

resentation in Hom(AFt , Vτ ) ≃ Vτ ⊗ (AFt )∗ . In accordance with [14], Def. 10.7,
we put

Lemma 9.7 Let v ∈ F W and let ψ ∈ A t (XF,v : τF ).
 (a) There exists a Laurent functional L ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur ⊗ ◦ CF,v such that
                      ψ(m) = L[E ◦ (XF,v : · : m)],           (m ∈ XF,v ).      (9.15)

 (b) There exists a functional as in (a) with support contained in Λ(XF,v , F ),
     the set introduced in Remark 9.5. In particular, the support of this func-
     tional is real.
 (c) If L is any Laurent functional as in (a), then, for all x ∈ X,

                           EF,v (ν: x)ψ = L[E ◦ (ν + · : x) ◦ iF,v ]
      as an identity of meromorphic functions in ν ∈ a∗F qC .
Proof: As in the proof of Theorem 9.3 we may express ψ by (9.8). Let L0 be
defined as in (9.10) and let the Laurent functional L ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur ⊗ ◦ CF,v
be defined by Lϕ = L0 (ϕ( · ) ◦ prF,v ), for ϕ ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF ) ⊗ ◦ CF,v   ∗
                                                                                . Since
                    ◦
prF,v ◦ iF,v = I on CF,v , it follows from (9.10), (9.9) and (9.8) that L satisfies
(9.15). We observe that supp L ⊂ supp RF ⊂ Λ(XF,v , F ); in particular, L has
support contained in ∗ a∗F q . This establishes (a) and (b).
    Now assume that L is a Laurent functional as in (a). Let L′ be the Laurent
functional in M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur ⊗ ◦ C defined by L′ ϕ = L(ϕ( · ) ◦ iF,v ). Then it
follows from Lemma 9.2 that the family g: a∗F qC × X → Vτ defined by
                             g(ν, x) = L′ [E ◦ (ν + · : x)]
belongs to EFhyp (X : τ ) and satisfies, for u ∈ F W, ν in an open dense subset of
a∗F qC and all X ∈ aF q and m ∈ XF,u ,
               qν−ρF (PF , u | gν ) =     L′ [E ◦ (XF,v : · ) ◦ prF,u ]
                                     =    L[E ◦ (XF,v : · ) ◦ prF,u ◦ iF,v ]
                                     =    prF,u ◦ iF,v ψ.
Here we note that the last equality is obvious for u 6= v, since then prF,u ◦ iF,v =
                                                              ∗
0. On the other hand, if u = v, then prF,u ◦ iF,v = I on A t (XF,v : τF ) and the
equality follows from the assumption on ψ. It now follows from Theorem 9.3
that g(ν, x) = EF◦ (ν : x) ◦ iF,v ψ.                                               

satisfies Hg ⊂ H. It now follows from Lemma 9.7 (c), combined with [14],
Prop. 13.2, that Y ⊂ Y (F ) and that Hf ⊂ HF (Y (F )), with the latter set
defined as in [14], Eqn. (11.6). It follows from the mentioned definition and
the fact that H and Y (F ) are real, that HF (Y (F )) and hence Hf are real. It
remains to establish (9.17).
     Let Q, u, σ be as asserted. With a reasoning as above, it follows from Lemma
9.7, combined with [14], Lemma 14.5 and Proposition 13.9, that f is holomorphi-
cally σ-global along (Q, u) (see [14], Definition 13.6). Let ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (Q).
Then (9.17) follows by application of [14], Proposition 13.8.                           


10      Temperedness of the Eisenstein integral
In this section we show that the generalized Eisenstein integral EF◦ (ν)ψ, defined
in the previous section, is tempered for regular values of ν in ia∗F q .
    Let us first recall the notion of temperedness. Following [5], p. 415, we define
the function Θ: X → R by
                                        p
                                Θ(x) = Ξ(xσ(x)−1 ),

where Ξ is the elementary spherical function ϕ0 associated with the Riemannian
symmetric space G/K.
   Moreover, we define the function lX : X → [0, ∞ [, denoted τ in [5], by

                  lX (kah) = | log a|,      (k ∈ K, a ∈ Aq , h ∈ H).               (10.1)


                                            41
Definition 10.1 A D(X)-finite function f in C ∞ (X : τ ) is said to be tempered
if there exists a d ∈ N such that

                           sup(1 + lX )−d Θ−1 kf k < ∞.                      (10.2)
                               X

The space of these functions is denoted by Atemp (X : τ ).

   The following lemma gives a criterion for temperedness in terms of ex-
ponents. We assume that Pmin ⊂ Pσmin is a choice of representatives for
Pσmin/WK∩H and that W ⊂ NK (aq ) is a choice of representatives for W/WK∩H .
We also assume that P1 is a fixed element of Pσmin .

Lemma 10.2 Let f ∈ C ∞ (X : τ ) be a D(X)-finite function. Then the following
conditions are equivalent.
 (a) f ∈ Atemp (X : τ ).
 (b) For each P ∈ Pmin and every ξ ∈ Exp (P, e | f ) the estimate Re ξ + ρP ≤ 0
     holds on a+
               q (P ).

 (c) For each v ∈ W and every ξ ∈ Exp (P1 , v | f ) the estimate Re ξ + ρP1 ≤ 0
     holds on a+
               q (P1 ).

Proof: By sphericality and the decomposition G = cl ∪P ∈Pmin KA+      q (P )H,
see [3], Cor. 1.4 and top of p. 232, the estimate (10.2) is equivalent to the
requirement that, for each P ∈ Pmin,

                     sup (1 + | log a|)−d Θ(a)−1 kf (a)k < ∞.
                   a∈A+
                      q (P )



By [5], Prop. 17.2, there exist constants C > 0 and N ∈ N such that, for each
P ∈ Pmin ,

            a−ρP ≤ Θ(a) ≤ C (1 + | log a|)N a−ρP          (a ∈ A+
                                                                q (P )).

Therefore, (10.2) is equivalent to the existence of a constant d′ ∈ N such that,
for each P ∈ Pmin ,
                                             ′
                       sup (1 + | log a|)−d aρP kf (a)k < ∞.
                     a∈A+
                        q (P )



According to [3], Thm. 6.1, this condition is in turn equivalent to (b). This
establishes the equivalence of (a) and (b), for any choice of Pmin . The equivalence
of (b) and (c) follows from the observation that {v −1 P1 v | v ∈ W} is a choice of
representatives for Pσmin /WK∩H combined with the fact that Exp (v −1 P1 v, e |
f ) = v −1 Exp (P1 , v | f ), for v ∈ W, by [14], Lemma 3.6.                      




                                        42
    If G has compact center modulo H and t ∈ WT(Σ) is a W -invariant even
residue weight, then according to [12], Lemma 10.3, there exists, for every choice
of Hilbert structure on the space At (X : τ ), a unique endomorphism α = αt of
this space, such that
                          K∆t
                              (x : y) = e(x) ◦ α ◦ e(y)∗ ,                  (10.3)
for x, y ∈ X+ . Here the map e(x): At (X : τ ) → Vτ is defined by ϕ 7→ ϕ(x). The
corresponding function e, with values in Hom(At (X : τ ), Vτ ) ≃ Vτ ⊗ At (X : τ )∗ ,
is a τ ⊗ 1-spherical real analytic function on X. We recall from [12], Lemma 10.3,
that α is self-adjoint and bijective.
    In the following we assume that t ∈ WT(Σ) is a W -invariant even residue
                                                                       ∗
weight and that F ⊂ ∆. We equip each finite dimensional space A t (XF,v : τF ),
for v ∈ F W, with a positive definite inner product. Moreover, we equip the
                       ∗
direct sum space AFt , defined by (9.2), with the direct sum inner product,
denoted h · | · i. Here and in the following, we use a bar in the notation of an
inner product to indicate its sesquilinearity. Moreover, all such inner products
will be antilinear in the second variable.
           ∗
             t
    Let αF,v   = αF,v be the analogue of the endomorphism α for (XF,v , τF ), and
      ∗                  ∗
let αF = αF ∈ End(A t ) be the direct sum of the αF,v , for v ∈ F W. Then αF
        t

is self-adjoint and bijective. Moreover, according to [12], Prop. 10.9, see also
Lemma 10.2, we have, for x, y ∈ X,

                     KFt (ν : x : y) = EF◦ (ν : x) ◦ αF ◦ EF∗ (ν : y)            (10.4)

as an identity of End(Vτ )-meromorphic functions in the variable ν ∈ a∗F qC . Here
EF∗ denotes the dual generalized Eisenstein integral, defined by
                                                                 ∗
                    EF∗ (ν : y): = EF◦ (−ν̄ : y)∗ ∈ Hom(Vτ , AFt ),              (10.5)

for y ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗F qC .

Lemma 10.3 There exists a locally finite collection H1 of affine hyperplanes in
a∗F qC , such that ν 7→ EF∗ (ν) is regular on a∗F qC \ ∪H1 , and such that the following
holds. For every ν ∈ a∗F qC \ ∪H1 ,
                                                                  ∗
                     span{EF∗ (ν : y)v | y ∈ X+ , v ∈ Vτ } = AFt .               (10.6)

Proof: Let H0 be the collection of hyperplanes of Corollary 9.6 and let H1
be the image of H0 under the map ν 7→ −ν̄. In view of (10.5) the function
ν 7→ EF∗ (ν) is regular on the complement of ∪H1 .
                                      ∗
    Let ν ∈ a∗F qC \ ∪H1 and let ψ ∈ AFt . Assume that

                  hψ | EF∗ (ν : y)vi = 0   for all   y ∈ X+ , v ∈ Vτ .

Using (10.5) we see that EF◦ (−ν̄)ψ = 0. It now follows from Corollary 9.6 that
ψu = 0 for each u ∈ F W. Hence, ψ = 0 and (10.6) follows.                    



                                           43
   In the following we write ρ = ρP0 , where P0 denotes the standard parabolic
subgroup in Pσmin .

Lemma 10.4 Let v ∈ Vτ and y ∈ X+ . Then the family f : (ν, x) 7→ KFt (ν : x : y)v
belongs to EFhyp (X : τ ). Moreover, for every ν ∈ reg f and each u ∈ W,

                   Exp (P0 , u | fν ) ⊂ W F (ν + Λ(F )) − ρ − N∆,                  (10.7)

where Λ(F ) denotes the finite subset of −R+ F introduced in (8.7).

Proof: The first assertion follows from (10.4) and Theorem 9.3.
   According to [12], Prop. 3.1, the function λ 7→ E ∗ (P0 : λ : y)v belongs to the
space M(a∗qC , Σ)⊗ ◦ C(τ ). Combining this with [14], Lemma 14.3, we deduce that
the family h: a∗qC × X+ → Vτ , defined by
                              X
                   h(λ, x) =      E+,s (P0 : λ : x)E ∗ (P0 : λ : y)v
                              s∈W F


belongs to E0hyp (X+ : τ ), hence to C0ep,hyp (X+ : τ ). Using [14], Eqn. (14.13), we
see that if s ∈ W, µ ∈ N∆ and u ∈ NK (aq ), then

                          qs,µ (P0 , u | h) 6= 0 ⇒ s ∈ W F .                       (10.8)

In the notation of § 5, define the Laurent functional L ∈ M(∗ a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur by
                                         X
                                   L=             Restλ+a∗F q ;
                                        λ∈Λ(F )

then supp L ⊂ Λ(F ). It follows from (8.7) that f = L∗ h. From [14], Prop. 13.2
(b), it now follows that there exists an open dense subset Ω ⊂ a∗F qC such that,
for ν ∈ Ω,

Exp (P0 , u | fν ) ⊂ {s(ν+λ)−ρ−µ | s ∈ W, λ ∈ Λ(F ), µ ∈ N∆, qs,µ (P0 , v | h) 6= 0}.

In view of (10.8) this implies that the inclusion (10.7) holds for ν ∈ Ω. From
f ∈ EFhyp (X : τ ) it follows in particular that there exists a finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗F qC
                    ep,hyp
such that f ∈ CF,Y         (X+ : τ ). The canonical map W → W/WF restricts to a
bijection s 7→ s̄ from W F onto W/WF . For s ∈ W F we put Es̄ = −sΛ(F ) + N∆.
We now apply Lemma 7.2, with Q = PF , P = P0 , so that W/∼P |Q ≃ W/WF ,
and with Eσ as just defined, for σ ∈ W/WF . Then it follows that the inclusion
(10.7) holds for ν ∈ reg f.                                                             

Theorem 10.5 Let ψ ∈ AFt and p ∈ ΠΣr (F ) (a∗F q ). Then g: (ν, x) 7→ p(ν)EF◦ (ν : x)ψ
defines a family in EFhyp (X : τ ). Moreover, for each v ∈ W and every ν ∈ reg g,

                   Exp (P0 , v | gν ) ⊂ W F (ν + Λ(F )) − ρ − N∆,                  (10.9)

where Λ(F ) denotes the finite subset of −R+ F introduced above (8.7).

                                             44
Proof: The first assertion follows from Theorem 9.3. By Lemma 10.3 there
exists a ν0 ∈ a∗F qC and elements yj ∈ X+ and vj ∈ Vτ , for 1 ≤ j ≤ r, such
                                                         ∗                             ∗
that αF ◦ EF∗ (ν0 : yj )vj , 1 ≤ j ≤ r is a basis for AFt . Define meromorphic AFt -
valued functions on a∗F qC by ψj : = αF ◦ EF∗ ( · : yj )vj , for 1 ≤ j ≤ r. By standard
arguments involving analyticity and linear algebra it follows that (ψj (ν) | 1 ≤
                             ∗
j ≤ r) is a basis for AFt , for ν in an open dense subset of a∗F qC . Moreover,
       ∗                                                            P
ψ ∈ AFt may be expressed as a linear combination ψ =                   1≤j≤r cj (ν)ψj (ν),
with meromorphic functions cj : a∗F qC → C. Using (10.4) we now deduce that
                                   r
                                   X

                                   j=1

as an identity of meromorphic functions in the variable ν ∈ a∗F qC . From Lemma
10.4 it follows that there exists a dense open subset Ω ⊂ a∗F qC such that ν 7→ gν
is regular on Ω and such that, for ν ∈ Ω, the inclusion (10.9) is valid. From
g ∈ EFhyp (X : τ ) it follows that there exists a finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗F qC such that
      ep,hyp
g ∈ CF,Y     (X+ : τ ). By the same argument as at the end of the proof of Lemma
10.4 we now conclude that the inclusion (10.9) is valid for every ν ∈ reg g. 

Corollary 10.6 Let notation be as in Theorem 10.5. Then, for each ν ∈
ia∗F q ∩ reg g,
                          gν ∈ Atemp (X : τ ).

Proof: Let ν ∈ ia∗F q ∩ reg g. Then from (10.9) it follows that every (P0 , v)-
exponent of gν is of the form ξ = s(ν + η) − ρ − µ, with s ∈ W F , η ∈ Λ(F ) and
µ ∈ N∆. Now Λ(F ) ⊂ −R+ F, hence sη ∈ −R+ Σ+ . It follows that Re ξ + ρ =
sη − µ ∈ −R+ ∆, hence Re ξ + ρ ≤ 0 on A+    q (P0 ). In view of Lemma 10.2, this
implies that gν ∈ Atemp (X : τ ).                                              


11      Initial uniform estimates
In this section we shall derive estimates for the generalized Eisenstein integrals
EF◦ (ν), with uniformity in the parameter ν ∈ a∗F qC , from similar estimates for the
normalized Eisenstein integral E ◦ (λ) = E ◦ (P0 : λ). The idea is that estimates
of the latter survive the application of certain Laurent functionals.
    We start with an investigation of the type of estimates involved. For Q ∈ Pσ
and R ∈ R, we define

             a∗Qq (Q, R): = {ν ∈ a∗QqC | Re hν , αi < R, ∀α ∈ Σr (Q)}.

The closure of this set is denoted by ā∗Qq (Q, R). It is readily seen to consist of
all elements ν ∈ a∗QqC with Re hν , αi ≤ R for all α ∈ Σr (Q).
    In the following lemma we assume that S is a finite subset of a∗Qq \ {0} and
we use the notation of Section 4.

                                              45
Lemma 11.1 Let R ∈ R, p ∈ ΠS (a∗Qq ), u ∈ S(a∗Qq ) and n ∈ N. Then for every
real number R− < R and every δ > 0 there exists a constant C > 0 with the
following property.
    Assume that V is any complete locally convex space, s a continuous semi-
norm on V and b > 0 a constant. Moreover, let f : a∗Qq (Q, R) → V be a holo-
morphic function satisfying the estimate
                             s(p(ν)f (ν)) ≤ (1 + |ν|)n eb|Re ν| ,
for all ν ∈ a∗Qq (Q, R). Then

                         s(uf (ν)) ≤ C(1 + |ν|)n ebδ eb|Re ν| ,
for all ν ∈ a∗Qq (Q, R− ).
Proof: It suffices to prove this on the one hand for u = 1 and p arbitrary
and on the other hand for p = 1 and u arbitrary. In the first case the proof is
essentially the same as that of Lemma 6.1 in [5], which is based on an application
of Cauchy’s integral formula.
    In the second case the proof relies on a straightforward application of Cauchy’s
integral formula.                                                                
   Let H be a Σ-configuration in a∗qC . For Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC a finite subset, we define
the Σr (Q)-configuration HQ (Y ) = Ha∗QqC (Y ) in a∗QqC as in (4.6), with L = a∗QqC
and S = Y, see also [14], text preceding Cor. 11.6. Thus, for ν ∈ a∗QqC , we have
 ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪HQ (Y ) ⇐⇒ {∀λ ∈ Y ∀H ∈ H:                 λ + ν ∈ H ⇒ λ + a∗QqC ⊂ H}.
Let now L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur have support contained in the finite subset Y of
∗ ∗
 aQqC .For any locally convex space V we have an associated continuous linear
operator L∗ as in (4.7). The following result expresses the continuity with
uniformity in the space V.
Lemma 11.2 Let H, Y, L be as above, and let d: H → N be a map. Then there
exists a map d′ : HQ (Y ) → N with the following property. For any locally convex
space V, the prescription
                                  L∗ f (ν) = L[f ( · + ν)]
defines a continuous linear operator
                  L∗ : M(a∗qC , H, d, V ) → M(a∗QqC , HQ (Y ), d′ , V ).
Proof: This is Cor. 11.6 of [14].                                                     

   A real Σr (Q)-configuration H in         a∗QqC   consists of hyperplanes of the form
                             Hα,s : = {ν ∈ a∗QqC | hα , νi = s},
with α ∈ Σr (Q) and s ∈ R. The configuration H′ is called Q-bounded if there
exists a constant s0 ∈ R such that Hα,s ∈ H′ ⇒ s ≥ s0 , for all α ∈ Σr (Q), s ∈ R.
See [11], text before Lemma 3.1, for the similar notion for Q minimal.

                                             46
Lemma 11.3 Let Q ∈ Pσ , P ∈ Pσmin and P ⊂ Q. Let Y ⊂ ∗ a∗Qq be a finite
subset.
 (a) If H is a P -bounded real Σ-configuration in a∗qC , then HQ (Y ) is a Q-
     bounded real Σr (Q)-configuration in a∗QqC .
 (b) If H′ is a Q-bounded real Σr (Q)-configuration in a∗QqC , then for every
     R ∈ R the collection {H ∈ H′ | H ∩ ā∗Qq (Q, R) 6= ∅} is finite.
 (c) If H′ is as in (b), then for every R ∈ R there exists a constant R+ > R
     such that H ∩ā∗Qq (Q, R) 6= ∅ ⇐⇒ H ∩a∗Qq (Q, R+ ) 6= ∅, for every H ∈ H′ .

Proof: There exists t0 ∈ R such that the hyperplanes in H are all of the form
Hβ,t , with β ∈ Σ(P ) and t ∈ [t0 , ∞ [. Let η ∈ Y and assume that −η + Hβ,t
intersects a∗QqC in a proper hyperplane H ′ . Then it follows that the restriction
α = β|aQq is non-zero, hence belongs to Σr (Q). Moreover, H ′ = Hα,s with
s = t− hβ , ηi. Let m be the maximum of the numbers hβ , ηi, for β ∈ Σ(P )\ ΣQ
and η ∈ Y and put s0 = t0 − m. Then it follows that every hyperplane from
HQ (Y ) is of the form Hα,s , with α ∈ Σr (Q) and s ≥ s0 . This establishes (a).
     To prove (b), fix α ∈ Σr (Q) and put Iα,R = {s ∈ R | Hα,s ∈ H, Hα,s ∩
ā∗Qq (Q, R) 6= ∅}, for every R > 0. Then it suffices to show that Iα,R is finite.
Since H is locally finite, the set Iα,R is discrete, and since H is Q-bounded, the
set Iα,R is bounded from below. If h ∈ Hα,s ∩ ā∗Qq (Q, R), then s = hα , hi ≤ R.
It follows that the set Iα,R is bounded from above by R. Hence, Iα,R is finite.
     For (c) we observe that R ≤ R′ ⇒ Iα,R ⊂ Iα,R′ . Fix R′ > R. Using that
Iα,R′ is discrete, we see that we may choose R+ ∈ ] R, R′ [ sufficiently close to
R so that Iα,R+ = Iα,R for all α ∈ Σr (Q). The constant R+ has the required
property.                                                                        
   If H′ is a Q-bounded real Σr (Q)-configuration in a∗QqC , and d′ : H′ → N a
map, then, for R ∈ R, we define the polynomial function πQ,R,d′ on a∗QqC in
analogy with (4.3) by
                                        Y d′ (H)
                            πQ,R,d′ : =   lH ,
                                          H

where the product is taken over the collection of H ∈ H′ whose intersection
with ā∗Qq (Q, R) is non-empty; this collection is finite by Lemma 11.3 (b). It
follows from Lemma 11.3 (c) that πQ,R,d′ = πQ,R+ ,d′ , for R+ > R sufficiently
close to R.

Proposition 11.4 Let Q ∈ Pσ , P ∈ Pσmin and P ⊂ Q. Let Y ⊂ ∗ a∗Qq be a finite
subset and let L ∈ M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur be a Laurent functional with supp L ⊂
Y. Let H be a P -bounded Σ-configuration in a∗qC , d: H → N a map, and let
d′ : HQ (Y ) → N be associated with the above data as in Lemma 11.2. Let M >
maxη∈Y |Re η| and assume that R, R′ ∈ R are constants with Y + a∗Qq (Q, R′ ) ⊂
a∗q (P, R− ) for some R− < R.
     There exists a constant k ∈ N and for every n ∈ N a constant C > 0 with
the following property.


                                       47
   If V is a complete locally convex space, s a continuous seminorm on V, b > 0
a positive constant and ϕ a function in M(a∗qC , H, d, V ) satisfying the estimate

                        s(πP,R,d (λ)ϕ(λ)) ≤ (1 + |λ|)n eb|Re λ| ,

for all λ ∈ a∗q (P, R), then the function L∗ ϕ ∈ M(a∗QqC , HQ (Y ), d′ , V ) satisfies
the estimate

                  s(πQ,R′ ,d′ (ν)L∗ ϕ(ν)) ≤ C(1 + |ν|)n+k ebM eb|Re ν|

for all ν ∈ a∗Qq (Q, R′ ).

Proof: It suffices to prove this for the case that supp L consists of a single
point λ0 ∈ Y. Let H0 be the collection of H ∈ H containing λ0 + a∗QqC . Then for
every H ∈ H0 there is a unique indivisible root αH ∈ ΣQ ∩ Σ(P ) such that H =
λ0 + (α⊥                                          ∗
       H )C . We define the affine function lH : aqC → C by lH (λ) = hλ − λ0 , αH i.
             −1
Then H = lH (0). We define the polynomial function q0 : a∗qC → C by
                                           Y        d(H)
                                    q0 =            lH     .
                                           H∈H0

From the definition of the space of Laurent functionals in M(∗ a∗QqC , ΣQ )∗laur
supported at λ0 , see §4, it follows that there exists a u ∈ S(∗ a∗Qq ) such that
on a function f ∈ (q0 |∗ a∗QqC )−1 Oλ0 the action of the Laurent functional is given
by Lf = u(q0 |∗ a∗QqC f )(λ0 ). It follows that for ϕ ∈ M(a∗qC , H, d, V ) and ν ∈
a∗QqC \ ∪HQ (Y ),

        L∗ ϕ(ν) = L(ϕ( · + ν)) = u(q0 ( · )ϕ( · + ν))(λ0 ) = u(q0 ϕ)(λ0 + ν).

As in the proof of [11], Lemma 1.2, we infer that there exist a polynomial
function π ∈ ΠΣr (Q) (a∗Qq ) and finitely many qj ∈ P (a∗Qq ) and uj ∈ S(a∗q ), all
independent of V, s, b and ϕ, such that
                                      X
            π(ν) u(q0 ϕ)(λ0 + ν) =        qj (ν)uj (πP,R,d ϕ)(λ0 + ν),     (11.1)
                                           j

for ν ∈ a∗Qq (Q, R′ ). Multiplying both sides of (11.1) with a suitable polynomial
function we see that we may as well assume that π = π0 πQ,R′ ,d′ , for some
π0 ∈ ΠΣr (Q) (a∗Qq ). We obtain
                                    X
                     π0 (ν)ψ(ν) =        qj (ν)uj (πP,R,d ϕ)(λ0 + ν),           (11.2)
                                     j

where we have written ψ = πQ,R′ ,d′ L∗ ϕ.
    Let k be the maximum of the degrees of the polynomials qj . Then there
exists a constant D > 0, independent of V, s, b and ϕ, such that for every j,

                        |qj (ν)| ≤ D(1 + |ν|)k ,           (ν ∈ a∗QqC ).        (11.3)

                                               48
Put m = maxη∈Y |Re η| and fix δ > 0 such that m + 2δ < M. We may select
            ′
constants R+  > R′ and R− < R such that Y + ā∗Qq (Q, R+ ′
                                                           ) ⊂ a∗q (P, R− ).
           ′
Adapting R+ if necessary, we may in addition assume that
                                  πQ,R′+ ,d′ = πQ,R′ ,d′ ,                         (11.4)
see the text preceding the proposition.
    Let now n ∈ N and b > 0, and assume that ϕ satisfies the hypotheses of the
proposition. It follows from Lemma 11.1, applied with P in place of Q, that
there exist constants Cj > 0, independent of V, s, b and ϕ, such that
                     s(uj (πP,R,d ϕ)(λ)) ≤ Cj (1 + |λ|)n ebδ eb|Re λ| ,            (11.5)
for λ ∈  a∗q (P, R− ).
    Using the estimate 1 + |λ0 + ν| ≤ (1 + |λ0 |)(1 + |ν|) and combining (11.2),
(11.3) and (11.5), we obtain
       s(π0 (ν)ψ(ν)) ≤ C ′ (1 + |ν|)n+k ebδ eb(|Re ν|+m) ,      (ν ∈ a∗Qq (Q, R+
                                                                               ′
                                                                                 )),
with                                  X
                              C ′ = D(  Cj )(1 + |λ0 |)n .
                                         j

From (11.4) we see that the function ψ is holomorphic on a∗Qq (Q, R+  ′
                                                                        ). We may
                                             ′        ′ bδ+bm −1
therefore apply Lemma 11.1 with ψ, π0 , C and [C e           ] s in place of f, p, u
                  ′
and s, and with R+  , R′ in place of R, R− , respectively. Using that m + 2δ < M,
we obtain the desired estimate, with C > 0 a constant that is independent of
V, s, b and ϕ.                                                                    
    In the rest of the section we shall apply the above results to Eisenstein
integrals. We start with a suitable estimate for Eisenstein integrals associated
with minimal σ-parabolic subgroups.
Lemma 11.5 Let P ∈ Pσmin . Then there exists a P̄ -bounded real Σ-configuration
H in a∗qC and a map d: H → N such that the function λ 7→ E ◦ (P : λ) belongs to
the space M(a∗qC , H, d, C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(◦ C, Vτ )).
    Let R ∈ R and let p ∈ ΠΣ (a∗q ) be a polynomial such that the function λ 7→
p(λ)E ◦ (P : λ) is holomorphic on a neighborhood of ā∗q (P̄ , R). Then there exists
a constant r > 0 and for every u ∈ U (g) constants n ∈ N and C > 0 such that
                 kp(λ)E ◦ (P : λ : u; x)k ≤ C(1 + |λ|)n e(r+|Re λ|)lX (x) ,        (11.6)
for all λ ∈ ā∗q (P̄ , R) and x ∈ X. (See (10.1) for the definition of the function
lX .)
Proof: First assume that τ = τϑ , defined as in [9], text after Eqn. (28), with ϑ ⊂
Kb a finite subset. Then for x ∈ Aq the estimate (11.6) follows from [5], Corollary
16.2 and Proposition 10.3, combined with the fact that E ◦ (P : λ) = E 1 (P̄ : λ),
see [9], Eqn. (52). In view of the decomposition X = KAq (eH), the estimate
now follows for general x ∈ X by sphericality of the Eisenstein integral. Finally,
for general τ the estimate follows by application of the ‘functorial’ dependence
of the Eisenstein integral on τ, see [9], Eqn. (32).                              

                                             49
    We can now prove the following analogous result for the generalized Eisen-
stein integral.

Proposition 11.6 Let F ⊂ ∆, v ∈ F W and let t ∈ WT(Σ) be a W -invariant
even residue weight.
   There exists a P̄F -bounded, real Σr (F )-hyperplane configuration HF in a∗F qC
and a map dF : HF → N such that ν 7→ EF◦ (ν) belongs to the space
                                                                 ∗
                      M(a∗QqC , HF , dF , C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(AFt , Vτ )).

Moreover, if R′ ∈ R and if p is any polynomial in ΠΣr (F ) (a∗F q ) such that ν 7→
      ◦
p(ν)EF,v (ν) is holomorphic on a neighborhood of ā∗F q (P̄F , R′ ), then there exist
a constant r > 0 and for every u ∈ U (g) constants n ∈ N and C > 0, such that
                        ◦
                  kp(ν)EF,v (ν : u; x)k ≤ C(1 + |ν|)n e(r+|Re ν|)lX (x) ,                  (11.7)

for all ν ∈ ā∗F q (P̄F , R′ ) and x ∈ X.

Remark 11.7 This result is a sharpening of the estimate given in [12], Lemma
10.8.

Proof: According to Lemma 9.7 (b,c), the generalized Eisenstein integral may
be expressed as
                       ◦
                      EF,v (ν : x)ψ = L∗ [E ◦ (P0 : · : x) ◦ iF,v ](ν),                    (11.8)

with L ∈ M(a∗F qC , ΣF )∗laur ⊗ ◦ CF,v a Laurent functional whose support is con-
tained in a finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗Qq . Let H, d be associated with P = P0 as
in Lemma 11.5. Let HF : = HF (Y ) and dF : = d′ be associated with the data
P = P0 , Q = PF , H, d, L as in Lemma 11.2, then HF is a real P̄F -bounded
Σr (F )-configuration, by Lemma 11.3. The first assertion of the proposition
follows by application of Lemma 11.2.
    Fix R ∈ R such that a∗F q (P̄F , R′ ) + Y ⊂ a∗q (P̄0 , R− ) for some R− < R. Let r
be the constant of Lemma 11.5 applied with P0 , R and πP̄0 ,R,d in place of P, R
and p, respectively. Fix u ∈ U (g). Then according to Lemma 11.5 there exist
constants n0 ∈ N and C0 > 0, such that for all x ∈ X,

         kπP̄0 ,R,d (λ)E ◦ (P0 : λ : u; x) ◦ iF,v k ≤ C0 (1 + |λ|)n0 e(r+|Re λ|)lX (x) ,

for all λ ∈ ā∗q (P̄0 , R). Let x ∈ X. We apply Proposition 11.4 to the function
ϕ = ϕx from M(a∗qC , H, d, Hom(◦ CF,v , Vτ )), given by

                               ϕx = E ◦ (P0 : · : u; x) ◦ iF,v ,

with the constant b = lX (x) and the seminorm s = C0−1 e−rb k · k. Let M >
maxη∈Y |Re η|. Then we obtain the estimate

          kπP̄F ,R′ ,dF (ν)L∗ (ϕx )(ν)k ≤ C1 (1 + |ν|)n0 +k e(r+|Re ν|+M)lX (x) ,

                                               50
for ν ∈ a∗F q (P̄F , R′ ), with constants k ∈ N and C1 > 0 that are independent of
x, ν. We now note that

                    L∗ (ϕx )    = L∗ (E ◦ (P0 : · : u; x) ◦ iF,v )(ν)
                                = L∗ (E ◦ (P0 : · ) ◦ iF,v )(ν)(u; x)
                                   ◦
                                = EF,v (ν : u; x),

as a meromorphic identity in ν ∈ a∗QqC . The second of the above identities
involves the interchange of u and L∗ , which is allowed by the continuity of L∗ ,
see Lemma 11.2. The third identity is obtained by application of (11.8). Thus,
we obtain, for all x ∈ X and all ν ∈ a∗F q (P̄F , R′ ), the estimate

                          ◦
        kπP̄F ,R′ ,dF (ν)EF,v (ν : u; x)k ≤ C1 (1 + |ν|)n0 +k e(r+|Re ν|+M)lX (x) .

This proves the result for the particular polynomial p = πP̄F ,R′ ,dF . For p equal
to a multiple of πP̄F ,R′ ,dF the result now also follows, since any polynomial
from Pd (a∗F q ), d ∈ N, can be estimated from above by a function of the form
C(1 + |ν|)d .
    Let p now be an arbitrary element of ΠΣr (F ) (a∗F q ) satisfying the hypothesis.
        ′
Fix R+      > R′ . Then an estimate of type (11.7) holds on a∗F q (P̄F , R+  ′
                                                                               ) with
pπP̄F ,R′+ ,dF in place of p. By application of Lemma 11.1 this implies an estimate
of the form (11.7), with the required dependences of the constants.                


12      Symmetric pairs of residue type
By L2d (X) we denote the discrete part of L2 (X), i.e., the closed span in L2 (X)
of all the irreducible closed subspaces of L2 (X). Accordingly we define

                       L2d (X : τ ): = (L2d (X) ⊗ Vτ ) ∩ L2 (X : τ ).

For the following definition we recall from Section 8 that the data (G, H, K, τ, aq , Σ+ )
together with a W -invariant even residue weight t ∈ WT(Σ) determine the con-
tinuous linear operator T∆ t
                             : Cc∞ (X : τ ) → C ∞ (X : τ ). If G has a compact center
modulo H, then this operator is given by the formula (8.9).

Definition 12.1 The reductive symmetric pair (G, H) is said to be of residue
type if the following conditions are fulfilled.
 (a) The group G has a compact center modulo H.
 (b) For any choice of the data (K, aq ), the following requirement is fulfilled.
     For every finite dimensional unitary representation τ of K, every choice
     Σ+ of positive roots for Σ and every W -invariant even residue weight
     t ∈ WT(Σ), the operator T∆ t
                                  : Cc∞ (X : τ ) → C ∞ (X : τ ) is the restriction of
     the orthogonal projection L (X : τ ) → L2d (X : τ ).
                                 2




                                            51
Remark 12.2 The above definition is given for technical reasons. Together
with Definition 13.1, where the notion of residue type for a parabolic subgroup
from Pσ will be introduced, it plays a role in a long chain of reasoning that will
be used in an induction step in the proof of Theorem 21.2. (The induction goes
by induction on the σ-split rank of G.) As part of the mentioned theorem it is
asserted that in fact every pair (G, H) with G having compact center modulo
H and every group from Pσ is of residue type.
    In the course of the chain of reasoning, many results will first be proved under
the assumption that an involved parabolic subgroup from Pσ or an involved
reductive symmetric pair (G, H) is of residue type. Such results will be marked
with (RT) after their declaration. The additional hypotheses will be clearly
stated at the beginning of their proofs. Within the chain of reasoning, until
Theorem 21.2, the results marked (RT) will only be used if these additional
hypotheses are assumed to be fulfilled. The mentioned theorem implies that
the additional hypotheses are in fact always fulfilled so that in the end the
results marked (RT) are valid as stated.
    Within the chain of reasoning, it also happens that definitions need extra
hypotheses concerning residue type in order to be valid. These definitions will be
marked (RT) as well. The extra hypotheses are stated in a subsequent remark.
Within the chain of reasoning such definitions will only be used if the extra
hypotheses are assumed to be fulfilled. In the end Theorem 21.2 implies that
the extra hypotheses are always fulfilled, so that the definitions marked (RT)
are valid as stated.

Remark 12.3 If aq = {0}, then X is compact and the operator T∆ is under-
stood to be the identity operator of Cc∞ (X : τ ). Thus, conditions (a) and (b) of
the definition are fulfilled and in this case (G, H) is of residue type.

Remark 12.4 It follows from Lemma 8.10 that the notion of residue type is
stable under isomorphisms of reductive symmetric pairs.

Remark 12.5 Condition (b) of the definition is valid as soon as a particular
choice of the data (K, aq ) satisfies the mentioned requirement. Indeed, assume
that (K, aq ) satisfies the requirement and let 8 K ⊂ G be a second σ-invariant
maximal compact subgroup, g = 8 k ⊕ 8 p the associated Cartan decomposition,
and 8 aq ⊂ q ∩ 8 p an associated maximal abelian subspace. Then there exists a
(unique) g ∈ exp(h ∩ p) such that gKg −1 = 8 K, see [38], p. 153. Now Ad(g)aq is
maximal abelian in 8 p ∩ q, hence there exists an element k ∈ 8 Ke ∩ He such that
Ad(kg)aq = 8 aq . Let ϕ: G → G be conjugation by kg, then ϕ maps the data
(G, H, K, aq ) onto (G, H, 8 K, 8 aq ). In view of Lemma 8.10 it follows that the
requirement in (b) for the pair (K, aq ) is equivalent to the similar requirement
for the pair (8 K, 8 aq ).

   We recall from [5], § 17, that the Schwartz space C(X : τ ) is defined to be
the space of functions f ∈ C ∞ (X : τ ) such that, for every u ∈ U (g) and n ∈ N,

                  su,n (f ): = sup (1 + lX )n Θ(x)−1 kuf (x)k < ∞;           (12.1)
                             x∈X


                                        52
see also the beginning of § 10. The Schwartz space is equipped with the Fréchet
topology determined by the seminorms su,n . By [3], Lemma 7.2, the operators
from D(X) act on C(X : τ ) by continuous linear endomorphisms. We define
A2 (X : τ ) to be the space of D(X)-finite functions in C(X : τ ).

Lemma 12.6 (RT) Let G have compact center modulo H. Then, for every
W -invariant even residue weight t ∈ WT(Σ),

                        At (X : τ ) = L2d (X : τ ) = A2 (X : τ ).               (12.2)

In particular, the space A2 (X : τ ) is finite dimensional.

Remark 12.7 The fact that L2d (X : τ ) is finite dimensional is also an immedi-
ate consequence of the classification of the discrete series in [40]. In the present
paper it would not have been advantageous to use this known fact. Only the
spectral properties of the discrete series as formulated in Theorem 16.1 are
needed. The mentioned finite dimensionality naturally follows from the finite
dimensionality of At (X : τ ), by the nature of our argument.

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that (G, H) is of residue type,
see Remark 12.2. It follows from Definition 12.1 (b) that T∆  t
                                                                (Cc∞ (X : τ )) is dense
in L2d (X : τ ). By Lemma 9.1 it follows that At (X : τ ) is dense in L2d (X : τ ). By
finite dimensionality of the first of these spaces, the first equality in (12.2)
follows. In particular, it follows that the space L2d (X : τ ) consists of smooth
D(X)-finite functions; by [3], Thm. 7.3 with p = 2 it is therefore contained
in A2 (X : τ ). Conversely, if f ∈ A2 (X : τ ), then f is K-finite and D(X)-finite.
Hence, by a well known result of Harish-Chandra its (g, K)-span in C(X, Vτ )
is a (g, K)-module of finite length; see [41], p. 312, Thm. 12 and [42], p. 112,
Thm. 4.2.1. The closure of this span in L2 (X) ⊗ Vτ is therefore a finite direct
sum of irreducible representations. The mentioned closure contains f ; hence,
f ∈ L2d (X : τ ).                                                                    
   Assume that G has compact center modulo H and that t ∈ WT(Σ) is a W -
invariant even residue weight. We recall that a choice of Hilbert structure on the
space At (X : τ ) uniquely determines an endomorphism α = αt ∈ End(At (X : τ ))
such that (10.3) holds.

Lemma 12.8 (RT) Assume that G has compact center modulo H and let t ∈
WT(Σ) be a W -invariant even residue weight.
 (a) Assume that the space At (X : τ ) is equipped with the restriction of the in-
     ner product from L2 (X) ⊗ Vτ , see (12.2). Then the endomorphism α, de-
     termined by (10.3), equals |W |−1 times the identity operator of At (X : τ ).
                 t
 (b) The kernel K∆ is independent of the residue weight t.

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that (G, H) is of residue type,
see Remark 12.2. It follows from (12.2) that the real analytic τ ⊗ 1-spherical


                                           53
function e on X attains its values in Hom(L2d (X : τ ), Vτ ) ≃ Vτ ⊗ L2d (X : τ )∗ .
Hence, e∗ : y 7→ e(y)∗ is a real analytic 1 ⊗ τ ∗ -spherical function on X, with
values in Hom(Vτ , L2d (X : τ )).
   We define the continuous linear operator P : Cc∞ (X : τ ) → L2d (X : τ ) by
                                    Z
                               Pf =   e(y)∗ f (y) dy.
                                      X

Then one readily verifies that hP f | ψi = hf | ψi for every ψ ∈ L2d (X : τ ). It
follows that P equals the restriction to Cc∞ (X : τ ) of the orthogonal projection
L2 (X : τ ) → L2d (X : τ ). Hence, P = T∆   t
                                              . Combining this with (8.9) we obtain
that, for all x ∈ X and all f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ),
                   Z
                          t                        t
              |W |     K∆   (x : y)f (y) dy = T∆     f (x) = e(x)(P f )
                    X
                                                 Z
                                              =      e(x) ◦ e(y)∗ f (y) dy.
                                                X

                 ∗
Since e(x) ◦ e( · ) and t
                       K∆ (x :   · ) are smooth and τ ∗ ⊗1-spherical functions on X,
                                                                          t
with values in End(Vτ ), it follows from the above identities that |W |K∆   (x : y) =
           ∗                                                            −1 2
e(x) ◦ e(y) for all x, y ∈ X. This implies (10.3) with α equal to |W | ILd (X : τ ) .
Hence, (a) holds. Assertion (b) is now immediate.                                   


13     The normalized Eisenstein integral
In this section we shall define the normalized Eisenstein integral, initially for the
class of parabolic subgroups introduced in the following definition, see Remark
12.2.
Definition 13.1 A parabolic subgroup P ∈ Pσ is said to be of residue type
(relative to H) if for every v ∈ NK (aq ) the pair (MP , MP ∩ vHv −1 ) is of residue
type. A subset F ⊂ ∆ is said to be of residue type if the associated standard
σ-parabolic subgroup PF is of residue type.

Remark 13.2 In view of Remark 12.4 it suffices to require the above condition
for v in a choice of representatives P W ⊂ NK (aq ) of WP \W/WK∩H .

Remark 13.3 We write ◦ G for MG , the Langlands M -component of G viewed
as a parabolic subgroup. Thus, ◦ G equals the intersection of the kernels ker |χ|,
for χ: G → C∗ a character. By the previous remark, G (viewed as an element
from Pσ ) is of residue type relative to H if and only if the pair (◦ G, ◦ G ∩ H) is
of residue type. If G has compact center modulo H, then the pair (◦ G, ◦ G ∩ H)
is of residue type if and only if (G, H) is.

Definition 13.4 Two parabolic subgroups P, Q ∈ Pσ are said to be associated
if their σ-split components aP q and aQq are conjugate under W. The equivalence
relation of associatedness is denoted by ∼ .

                                          54
Lemma 13.5 Assume that P ∈ Pσ is of residue type. Then every Q ∈ Pσ
with Q ∼ P has the same property.

Proof: If Q ∼ P, there exists a k ∈ NK (aq ) such that aQq = Ad(k)aP q . From
this it follows that MQ = kMP k −1 . If v ∈ NK (aq ), then MQ ∩ vHv −1 equals
k(MP ∩ wHw−1 )k −1 , with w = k −1 v ∈ NK (aq ). The pair (MP , MP ∩ wHw−1 )
is of residue type, and by Remark 12.4 we conclude that (MQ , MQ ∩ vHv −1 ) is
of residue type as well.                                                    
   Let P ∈ Pσ . We equip the space XP,v , for v ∈ P W, with the invariant
measure dxP,v specified at the end of Section 5. The space A2 (XP,v : τP ) is
equipped with the inner product from L2 (XP,v , Vτ ), for v ∈ P W. Moreover, the
space A2,P = A2,P,P W is defined to be the formal direct sum
                                      M
                           A2,P : =           A2 (XP,v : τP ),               (13.1)
                                      v∈P W

equipped with the direct sum inner product. The space A2,P is finite dimen-
sional by Lemma 12.6. Application of this lemma requires P to be of residue
type, see Remark 12.2.
    We agree to denote by prP,v : A2,P → A2 (XP,v : τP ) the natural projection
operator, for v ∈ P W, and by iP,v the associated natural embedding operator.
    In the following we shall use the characterization of the generalized Eisenstein
integral by its asymptotic behavior, see Theorem 9.3, to define an Eisenstein
integral for arbitrary parabolic subgroups.

Proposition 13.6 (RT)
 (a) Let P ∈ Pσ . For every ψ ∈ A2,P there exists a unique family E ◦ (P : ψ) ∈
     EPhyp (X : τ ) with the following property. For all ν in a non-empty open
     subset of a∗P qC , each v ∈ P W, every X ∈ aP q and every m ∈ XP,v,+ ,

                      qν−ρP (P, v | E ◦ (P : ψ : ν), X, m) = ψv (m).

 (b) Let F ⊂ ∆. Then, for every W -invariant even residue weight t ∈ WT(Σ),
                 ∗
     the space AFt equals A2,F : = A2,PF ; here we assume that in the definition
     of both spaces the same set F W has been used. Moreover, for every ψ ∈
     A2,F ,
                          E ◦ (PF : ψ : ν : x) = EF◦ (ν : x)ψ,
      for all x ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗F qC .

Proof: Here we prove (a) under the assumption that P is of residue type and
(b) under the assumption that F is of residue type, see Remark 12.2.
    Uniqueness follows from Theorem 6.11. Thus, it suffices to establish ex-
istence. We will first do this for P of residue type and equal to a standard
parabolic subgroup PF , with F ⊂ ∆. Let t ∈ WT(Σ) be any W -invariant even
residue weight. Let ∗ t be the induced residue weight of ΣF . Then it follows from

                                          55
                                                                       ∗
Lemma 12.6, applied to the pair (MF , MF ∩ vHv −1 ), that A t (XF,v : τF ) =
A2 (XF,v : τF ). Moreover, if ψ ∈ A2 (XF,v : τF ), then E ◦ (PF : ψ): = EF◦ ( · )ψ sat-
isfies the desired property, by Theorem 9.3.
     Now assume that P is general and of residue type, let P W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a
choice of representatives for WP \W/WK∩H and let ψ ∈ A2,P . There exists a
u ∈ NK (aq ) such that u−1 P u = PF , with F ⊂ ∆. Moreover, PF is of residue
type, by Lemma 13.5. The set F W = u−1 (P W) is a choice of representatives
for WF \W/WK∩H in NK (aq ). For v ∈ P W, let ρτ,u be the linear isomorphism
from C ∞ (XF,u−1 v,+ : τF ) onto C ∞ (XP,v,+ : τP ), defined as in [14], Eqn. (3.24).
We define the function ψ ′ ∈ A2,F by ψu′ −1 v = ρ−1                  P
                                                     τ,u ψv , for v ∈ W. Define the
                          ∗        ∞
meromorphic family f : aP qC → C (X : τ ) by

                          fν (x) = E ◦ (PF : ψ ′ : u−1 ν : x),

for x ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗P qC . By Theorem 9.3 and Lemma 6.12, the family
f belongs to EPhyp (X : τ ). Moreover, it follows from [14], Lemma 3.6, that, for
v ∈ P W and ν in a dense open subset of a∗P qC ,

        qν−ρP (P, v | fν ) =    [Ad(u−1 )∗ ⊗ ρτ,u ] qu−1 ν−ρF (PF , u−1 v | fν )
                           =    ρτ,u ψu′ −1 v = ψv .

This establishes the result with E ◦ (P : ψ) = f.                                   
  From the uniqueness assertion in Proposition 13.6 it follows that the mero-
morphic function E ◦ (P : ψ): a∗P qC → C ∞ (X : τ ) depends linearly on ψ.

Definition 13.7 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . For ψ ∈ A2,P , let E ◦ (P : ψ) denote the
unique family in EPhyp (X : τ ) of Proposition 13.6 (a).
   The meromorphic C ∞ (X, Hom(A2,P , Vτ ))-valued function E ◦ (P : · ) = E ◦ (X : P : · )
on a∗P qC , defined by

                        E ◦ (P : ν : x)ψ = E ◦ (P : ψ : ν : x),

for ψ ∈ A2,P , x ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗QqC , is called the normalized Eisenstein
integral associated with the parabolic subgroup P (and the choice P W).
    The meromorphic C ∞ (X, Hom(Vτ , A2,P ))-valued function E ∗ (P : · ) on a∗P qC
defined by
                        E ∗ (P : ν : x) = E ◦ (P : −ν̄ : x)∗ ,
for ψ ∈ A2,P , x ∈ X, and generic ν ∈ a∗P qC , is called the dual Eisenstein integral
associated with P.

Remark 13.8 The above definition requires the validity of Proposition 13.6,
which inside the chain of reasoning leading up to Theorem 21.2, requires P to
be of residue type, see Remark 12.2.




                                          56
Remark 13.9 In the case of the group, the normalized Eisenstein integral
defined above is essentially equal to the one defined by Harish-Chandra [29],
§6, Thm. 6. This is seen as follows. Let 8 G be a real reductive group of
Harish-Chandra’s class, let G = 8 G × 8 G, let σ: G → G be the involution
given by (8 x, 8 y) 7→ (8 y, 8 x) and let H = Gσ be the diagonal subgroup. Then
(8 x, 8 y) 7→ 8 x(8 y)−1 induces a G-diffeomorphism Φ: G/H → 8 G. Let 8 g = 8 k ⊕ 8 p
be a Cartan decomposition, 8 θ the associated involution and put θ = 8 θ × 8 θ.
Then θ is a Cartan involution commuting with σ. Let 8 K and K = 8 K × 8 K be
the associated maximal compact subgroups of 8 G and G, respectively, and let
(τ, Vτ ) be a finite dimensional unitary representation of K. Let τ1 , τ2 be the uni-
tary representations of 8 K in Vτ defined by τ1 (8 k) = τ (8 k, 1) and τ2 (8 k) = (1, 8 k).
Let 8 τ denote the pair of commuting representations (τ1 , τ2 ). Then pull-back
by Φ induces a linear isomorphism Φ∗ from the space C ∞ (8 G : 8 τ ) of smooth
8
  τ -spherical functions on 8 G, onto C ∞ (G/H : τ ).
      Let a8 p be maximal abelian in 8 p, then aq : = {(X, −X) | X ∈ a8 p } is maximal
abelian in p ∩ q. Let 8 P ⊂ 8 G be a parabolic subgroup containing A8 p . Then
P : = 8 P ×8 P̄ belongs to Pσ . Moreover, the map (X, Y ) 7→ X−Y is surjective from
aP = a8 P × a8 P onto a8 P and induces a linear isomorphism from aP q = aP ∩ aq
onto a8 P , mapping a+              +                                     ∗
                          P q onto a8 P . The complexified adjoint map ϕ is the linear
                          ∗         ∗
isomorphism from a8 P C onto aP qC given by ν 7→ ( ν, − ν).
                                                  8      8    8

      We observe that MP = M8 P ×M8 P , so that XP = M8 P ×M8 P /H ∩MP , which
is MP -diffeomorphic to M8 P under the map ΦP induced by restricting Φ. It is
readily seen that Φ∗P restricts to a linear bijection from the finite dimensional
space L2d (M8 P : 8 τM8 P ) onto L2d (XP : τP ) = A2,P . Let ψ ∈ L2d (XP : τP ) and con-
sider the family f : a∗qC × G → Vτ defined by fν = Φ∗ E ◦ (8 P : Φ∗−1  P ψ: ϕ
                                                                                ∗−1
                                                                                    ν/i),
where the normalized Eisenstein integral is Harish-Chandra’s. By holomorphy
of Harish-Chandra’s unnormalized Eisenstein integral combined with meromor-
phy and the product structure of Harish-Chandra’s C-function C8 P |8 P (1 : 8 ν),
it follows that the family fν ∈ C ∞ (X : τ ) satisfies condition (a) of Definition
6.1. Via the subrepresentation theorem of [21], combined with induction by
stages, Harish-Chandra’s Eisenstein integral can be realized by matrix coeffi-
cients of the minimal principal series of 8 G. Using this information it can be
deduced that f satisfies the remaining conditions (b), (c) of Definition 6.1. In
fact, it is now readily checked that f belongs to the space CPhyp (X : τ ), de-
fined in Definition 6.6. Moreover, from the information on the constant term
of Harish-Chandra’s Eisenstein integral, see [29], §5, Thm. 5, it follows that
qν−ρP (P, 1 | fν , X, m) = ψ(m), in the notation of Proposition 13.6, for generic
ν ∈ ia∗P q . By meromorphy it now follows that the family f satisfies the condition
of Proposition 13.6 (a) (note that we may take P W = {1} here). Hence,
                    Φ∗ E ◦ (8 P : Φ∗−1
                                   P ψ: ϕ
                                         ∗−1
                                             ν/i) = E ◦ (P : ν)ψ.
Remark 13.10 At the end of the sequel to this paper, [15], we will show that
the normalized Eisenstein integral introduced above coincides (up to a change
from ν to −ν) with the one introduced by J. Carmona and P. Delorme in [19].
Remark 13.11 If G has compact center modulo H, then AGq = {0} and

                                            57
A2,G = A2 (G/H : τ ). In view of Lemma 12.6, it follows from Remark 9.4 that
E ◦ (G : 0 : x) equals the evaluation map evx : A2 (X : τ ) → Vτ , ψ 7→ ψ(x). Ac-
cordingly, E ∗ (G : 0 : x) = ev∗x ∈ Hom(Vτ , A2 (X : τ )).

    The following result describes the dependence of the normalized Eisenstein
integral on a member P of a class in Pσ /W, as well as on the choice of P W.

Lemma 13.12 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ , let s ∈ W, and let Q: = sP s−1 . Let P W and
Q
  W be choices of representatives in NK (aq ), for WP \W/WK∩H and WQ \W/WK∩H ,
respectively. Then there exists a unique linear map RP (s): A2,P → A2,Q such
that
                     E ◦ (Q : sν : x) ◦ RP (s) = E ◦ (P : ν : x),      (13.2)
for x ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗P qC . The map RP (s) is bijective and unitary.

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Left multiplication by s induces a bijective map WP \W/WK∩H →
WQ \W/WK∩H . Via the natural bijections P W → WP \W/WK∩H and Q W →
WQ \W/WK∩H we transfer the induced map to a bijection s̄: P W → Q W.
  Let ψ ∈ A2,P and define the meromorphic family f : a∗QqC → C ∞ (X : τ ) by

                           fλ (x) = E ◦ (P : s−1 λ : x)ψ,                         (13.3)
                                               hyp
for x ∈ X and generic λ ∈ a∗QqC . Then f ∈ EQ      (X : τ ), by Lemma 6.12. Select
    P
v ∈ W. We may select a representative us in NK (aq ) of a Weyl group element
from sWP such that us v = s̄(v)ws for some ws ∈ NK∩H (aq ). Note that XQ,us v =
XQ,s̄(v) . Hence, we may define the bijective linear map

                     ρτ,us : A2 (XP,v : τP ) → A2 (XQ,s̄(v) : τQ )

as in [14], Eqn. (3.24). This map is unitary in view of the choice of invariant
measures on XP,v and XQ,s̄(v) , specified at the end of Section 5.
    It follows from [14], Lemmas 3.7 and 3.6, that

        qλ−ρQ (Q, s̄(v) | fλ ) =    qλ−ρQ (Q, us v | fλ )
                               =    [Ad(us−1 )∗ ⊗ ρτ,us ]qs−1 λ−ρP (P, v | fλ )
                               =    ρτ,us ψv ,                                    (13.4)

for generic λ ∈ a∗QqC . Hence, by Definition 13.7,

                             fλ (x) = E ◦ (Q : λ : x)ψ ′ ,                        (13.5)
      ′
with ψs̄(v) = ρτ,us ψv for v ∈ P W. We define the bijective linear map RP (s): A2,P →
A2,Q by
                              (RP (s)ψ)s̄(v) = ρτ,us ψv .                     (13.6)
Then ψ ′ = RP (s)ψ and (13.2) follows from (13.3) and (13.5) by substituting sν
for λ. From the definition it follows that RP (s) is unitary.

                                          58
   To establish uniqueness, let RP (s): A2,P → A2,Q be a linear map. Let ψ ∈
A2,P , define f as above, and define the meromorphic family g: a∗QqC → C ∞ (X : τ )
by gλ = E ◦ (Q : λ : · )RP (s)ψ. Then

                         qλ−ρQ (Q, s̄(v) | gλ ) = (RP (s)ψ)s̄(v) .            (13.7)

Now assume that (13.2) holds. Then g = f ; combining (13.4) and (13.7) we
obtain (13.6).                                                          
   Let P ∈ Pσ . Then for all x, y ∈ X, the meromorphic End(Vτ )-valued function
on a∗P qC given by
                        ν 7→ E ◦ (P : ν : x)E ∗ (P : ν : y)              (13.8)
depends a priori on the choice of the set P W.

Corollary 13.13 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then for every x, y ∈ X the function
(13.8) is independent of the particular choice of P W.

Proof: Here we assume that P is of residue type, see Remark 12.2. The result
then follows from application of Lemma 13.12, with s = 1.                 

Proposition 13.14 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . There exists a P̄ -bounded, real Σr (P )-
hyperplane configuration H = HP in a∗P qC and a map d = dP : H → N such that
ν 7→ E ◦ (P : ν) belongs to the space

                      M(a∗P qC , H, d, C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(A2,P , Vτ )).

Moreover, if R ∈ R and if p is any polynomial in ΠΣr (P ) (a∗P q ) such that ν 7→
p(ν)E ◦ (P : ν) is holomorphic on a neighborhood ā∗P q (P̄ , R), then there exist a
constant r > 0 and for every u ∈ U (g) constants n ∈ N and C > 0, such that

                kp(ν)E ◦ (P : ν : u; x)k ≤ C(1 + |ν|)n e(r+|Re ν|)lX (x) ,    (13.9)

for all ν ∈ ā∗P q (P̄ , R) and x ∈ X.

Proof: Here we prove the result for P of residue type, see Remark 12.2.
     We first assume that P = PF with F ⊂ ∆ of residue type. In this case,
E ◦ (P : ν) = EF◦ (ν), by Proposition 13.6. Hence, the result follows from Propo-
sition 11.6 by summation over F W, see (9.14) and (9.2).
     Next, let P ∈ Pσ be a general parabolic subgroup of residue type. There
exists a s ∈ W such that sP s−1 = PF , by Lemma 3.6 (c). Since P is of residue
type, PF is of residue type as well, see Lemma 13.5. By Lemma 13.12 and
Proposition 13.6 there exists a unitary map RP (s): A2,P → AF,2 such that

                       E ◦ (PF : sν : x) ◦ RP (s) = E ◦ (P : ν : x)

for all x and generic ν ∈ a∗P qC . The result now follows by application of the first
part of the proof.                                                                 


                                            59
   The following result limits the exponents of the normalized Eisenstein inte-
gral along a minimal parabolic subgroup. To formulate it we need the following
notation. Let Q ∈ Pσ and let P ∈ Pσmin be such that P ⊂ Q. We put
                   ∆Q (P ) : =       {α ∈ ∆(P ) | α|aQq = 0};
                        P |Q
                    W          :=    {t ∈ W | t(∆Q (P )) ⊂ Σ(P )}.
Let s ∈ W be the unique element such that P = sP0 s−1 . Then s−1 Qs contains
P0 hence equals PF for some subset F ⊂ ∆; note that F is uniquely determined
by Q in view of Lemma 3.6. We define
                                    Λ(P |Q): = sΛ(F ),
where Λ(F ) is the finite subset of −R+ F introduced in (8.7). We note that
Λ(P |Q) is a finite subset of −R+ ∆Q (P ).
Proposition 13.15 (RT) Let Q ∈ Pσ and let P ∈ Pσmin be contained in Q.
Let ψ ∈ A2,Q and q ∈ ΠΣr (Q) (a∗Qq ). Then f : (ν, x) 7→ q(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν : x)ψ defines
             hyp
a family in EQ   (X : τ ). Moreover, for each v ∈ NK (aq ) and every ν ∈ reg f,

          Exp (P, v | fν ) ⊂ W P |Q (ν + Λ(P |Q)) − ρP − N∆(P ).              (13.10)
In particular, fν ∈ Atemp (X : τ ), for every ν ∈ ia∗Qq ∩ reg f.
Remark 13.16 For P minimal, the assertion about temperedness is due to
[5], Thm. 19.2, in view of [9], Eqn. (52). For general P the assertion about
temperedness is due to [22], Thm. 1, in view of Remark 13.10.
Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that Q is of residue type,
see Remark 12.2. Let s ∈ W and F ⊂ ∆ be as in the text preceding the
corollary. Let the polynomial function p: a∗F qC → C be defined by p(ν) = q(sν).
Then p ∈ ΠΣr (F ) (a∗F q ). It follows from Lemma 13.12 with PF in place of P
that f (ν, x) = g(s−1 ν, x), for x ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗QqC , where g: (λ, x) 7→
p(λ)EF◦ (λ : x)RPF (s)−1 ψ. By Theorem 10.5 the family g belongs to EFhyp (X : τ ).
                                          hyp
By Lemma 6.12 it follows that f ∈ EQ          (X : τ ). Moreover, let ν ∈ reg f ; then
 −1
s ν ∈ reg g and by the last mentioned theorem it follows that, for every u ∈
NK (aq ),
               Exp (P0 , u | fν )   = Exp (P0 , u | gs−1 ν )
                                    ⊂ W F (s−1 ν + Λ(F )) − ρ − N∆.
On the other hand, by [14], Lemma 3.6, it follows that, for v ∈ NK (aq ),
                       Exp (P, v | fν ) = sExp (P0 , s̄−1 v | fν ),
where s̄ is any representative of s in NK (aq ). We conclude that
             Exp (P, v | fν ) ⊂ sW F s−1 (ν + sΛ(F )) − ρP − N∆(P ).
Now sΛ(F ) = Λ(P |Q) by definition. Moreover, one readily verifies that sW F s−1 =
W P |Q . Hence, (13.10) follows. The final assertion follows from the similar as-
sertion for g, which in turn follows by application of Corollary 10.6.         

                                           60
   In the theory of the constant term, we shall need the following result on the
coefficients of the asymptotic expansions of the Eisenstein integral.

Lemma 13.17 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ and let ψ ∈ A2,P . The family f : (ν, x) 7→
                             hyp
E ◦ (P : ν : x)ψ belongs to EP,Y (X : τ ), for a suitable finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗P q .
Moreover, the Σr (P )-configuration Hf , defined as in the text before Definition
6.3, is real.
     Let k = dega f. Then for every Q ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ), each σ ∈ W/∼Q|P and
all ξ ∈ −σ · Y + N∆r (Q),

      qσ,ξ (Q, v | f ) ∈ Pk (aQq ) ⊗ M(a∗P qC , Hf , df , C ∞ (XQ,v : τQ )).   (13.11)

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. In view of Lemma 3.6 (a), there exist s ∈ W and F ⊂ ∆ such
that P = sPF s−1 . In view of Lemma 13.12 with P and PF in place of Q and P,
respectively, we may as well assume that P = PF for some F ⊂ ∆. In this case
we have E ◦ (P : ν) = EF◦ (ν) by Proposition 13.6. Hence, the result follows from
Lemma 9.8.                                                                      

Lemma 13.18 (RT) Let F ⊂ ∆ and let t ∈ WT(Σ) be a W -invariant even
residue weight. Then, for all x, y ∈ X,

          KFt (ν : x : y) = |WF |−1 E ◦ (PF : ν : x) ◦ E ∗ (PF : ν : y),       (13.12)

as an identity of End(Vτ )-valued meromorphic functions in the variable ν ∈
a∗F qC .
     In particular, the function KFt does not depend on the residue weight t, nor
on the choice of F W.

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that F is of residue type, see
                                                          ∗
Remark 12.2. From Proposition 13.6 (b) we recall that AFt = A2,F . Accordingly,
                      ∗
                        t
we equip the space AF with the inner product described in the text preceding
(13.1). As in the text preceding (10.4), this choice of inner product determines
                                  ∗
an endomorphism αF,v ∈ End(A t (XF,v : τF )), for each v ∈ F W. The endomor-
phism αF,v is the analogue for the space XF,v of the endomorphism α, described
                                                                       ∗
in (10.3). Thus, αF,v = |WF |−1 I, by Lemma 12.8. Let αF ∈ End(AFt ) be the
direct sum of the αF,v , for v ∈ F W. Then from (10.4) we obtain that

                  KFt (ν : x : y) = |WF |−1 EF◦ (ν : x)EF◦ (−ν̄ : y)∗ ,

for all x, y ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗F qC . Now use Definition 13.7 and Proposition
13.6 to conclude the validity of (13.12). It is now obvious that KFt does not
depend on t; it follows by application of Corollary 13.13 that it does not depend
on F W either.                                                                  

Remark 13.19 In view of Lemma 13.18 we agree to omit t in the notation
KFt .

Definition 13.20 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . We define the meromorphic function
KP : a∗P qC → C ∞ (X × X, End(Vτ )) by

                KP (ν : x : y) = |WP |−1 E ◦ (P : ν : x)E ∗ (P : ν : y),

for x, y ∈ X and generic ν ∈ a∗P qC .

    In the chain of reasoning leading up to Theorem 21.2 this definition requires
P to be of residue type, since only then the Eisenstein integral is well-defined,
see Remark 12.2.

Remark 13.21 If P = PF , for F ⊂ ∆, then KP = KF , in view of Lemma
13.18.

Lemma 13.22 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then, for every s ∈ W and all x, y ∈ X,

                         KP (ν : x : y) = KsP s−1 (sν : x : y)

as a meromorphic identity in ν ∈ a∗P qC .

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Put Q = sP s−1 . Since the inner product cB, specified in Sec-
tion 5, is W -invariant, the normalized measures dµP and dµQ are s-conjugate.
Moreover, since WQ = sWP s−1 , we have |WQ | = |WP |. The result now follows
from combining Definition 13.20 and Lemma 13.12.                           

Theorem 13.23 (RT) Let P, Q ∈ Pσ be associated parabolic subgroups. Then
for every s ∈ W (aQq | aP q ), and all x, y ∈ X,

                          KQ (sν : x : y) = KP (ν : x : y),                (13.13)

as an identity of End(Vτ )-valued meromorphic functions of the variable ν ∈
a∗P qC .

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P and Q are of residue
type, see Remark 12.2. Since P and Q are associated, dim aQq = dim aP q ;
hence, s is a linear bijection from aP q onto aQq . From Corollary 3.5 it follows
that there exists w ∈ W such that w(aP q ) = aQq and w|aP q = s.
    Assume first that P = PF and Q = PF ′ , with F, F ′ ⊂ ∆. Then the result
follows from [12], Lemma 6.2, since KFt = KPF and KFt ′ = KPF ′ , for any
W -invariant even residue weight t, see Remarks 13.19 and 13.21.
    Next assume that P and Q are arbitrary. Then the result follows by using
Lemma 3.6 (a) and Lemma 13.22.                                                 

14     Eigenvalues for the Eisenstein integral
In this section we investigate the action of D(X) on the normalized Eisenstein
integral.
    Let P ∈ Pσ . We define the algebra homomorphism µP : D(X) → D(X1P ) as
in [5], text following (20). Here X1P : = X1P,e = M1P /M1P ∩ H. Let b ⊂ q be
a θ-stable Cartan subspace containing aP q and let γb be the associated Harish-
Chandra isomorphism from D(X) onto I(b). Let WP (b) denote the centralizer of
aP q in W (b), and IP (b) the ring of WP (b)-invariants in S(b). Moreover, let γbX1P
denote the associated Harish-Chandra isomorphism D(X1P ) → IP (b). Then we
recall from [5], Eqn. (21), that

                                  γbX1P ◦ µP = γb .                           (14.1)

If v ∈ NK (aq ), then following [14], text above Lemma 4.12, we define the algebra
homomorphism µvP : D(G/vHv −1 ) → D(X1P,v ) as µP for the triple (G, vHv −1 , P )
instead of (G, H, P ). Moreover, we define the algebra homomorphism µP,v : D(X) →
D(X1P,v ) by
                                 µP,v = µvP ◦ Ad(v),                        (14.2)
where Ad(v) denotes the isomorphism D(X) → D(G/vHv −1 ) induced by the
adjoint action by v. Since AP q is central in M1P , it follows from (2.3) that

                         D(X1P,v ) ≃ D(XP,v ) ⊗ S(aP q ).                     (14.3)

Accordingly, if D ∈ D(X), we shall write µP,v (D : · ) for µP,v (D), viewed as
a D(XP,v )-valued polynomial function on a∗P qC . If D ∈ D(X), ν ∈ a∗P qC , and
v ∈ P W, then µP,v (D : ν) ∈ D(XP,v ) acts on the space A2 (XP,v : τP ) (see the
text preceding Lemma 12.6) by an endomorphism that we denote by µP,v (D : ν).
                                                       P
The direct sum of these endomorphisms, for v ∈              W, is an endomorphism of
the space A2,P , denoted µP (D : ν).

Lemma 14.1 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then

              DE ◦ (P : ν) = E ◦ (P : ν) µP (D : ν),         (D ∈ D(X)).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Let ψ ∈ A2,P . Then the family f : a∗P qC × X → Vτ , defined by

                             f (ν, x) = E ◦ (P : ν : x)ψ,

belongs to EPhyp (X : τ ), by Proposition 13.6. Let D ∈ D(X). The family Df : (ν, x) 7→
Dfν (x) belongs to EPhyp (X : τ ) as well, by Definition 6.6 and [14], Lemma 9.8.
Moreover, by [14], Lemma 6.2, there exists a dense open subset Ω of a∗P qC such
that, for ν ∈ Ω, the element ν − ρP is a leading exponent of fν along (P, v).
Hence, by [14], Lemma 4.12, it follows that, for ν ∈ Ω, X ∈ aP q and m ∈ XP,v,+ ,

               qν−ρP (P, v | Df )(X, ν, m) = µP,v (D)ϕν (exp Xm),

                                         63
where the function ϕν : X1P,v,+ → Vτ is defined by

                     ϕν (ma) = aν qν−ρP (P, v | fν , log a, ν, m),             (14.4)

for a ∈ AP q and m ∈ XP,v,+ . By Proposition 13.6, the expression on the right-
hand side of (14.4) equals aν ψv (m), and we see that

                 qν−ρP (P, v | Df )(X, ν, m) = µP,v (D : ν)ψv (m),             (14.5)

for ν in a dense open subset of a∗P qC , m ∈ XP,v,+ and X ∈ aP q .
    On the other hand, ν 7→ µP (D : ν)ψ is a polynomial A2,P -valued function
on a∗P qC . It readily follows that the family

                       g: (ν, x) 7→ E ◦ (P : ν : x) µP (D : ν)ψ

belongs to EPhyp (X : τ ). Moreover, by Proposition 13.6, it follows that

                  qν−ρP (P, v | g)(X, ν, m) = µP,v (D : ν)ψv (m),              (14.6)

for each v ∈ P W, ν in a dense open subset of a∗P qC , all X ∈ aP q and all m ∈
XP,v,+ . It follows from (14.5) and (14.6) that the family Df − g ∈ EPhyp (X : τ )
satisfies all hypotheses of Theorem 6.11. Therefore, Df = g.                   
     In the rest of this section we shall study the eigenvalues of the endomorphism
µP (D : ν) of A2,P . For a start, we collect some facts about the action of D(X)
on A2 (X : τ ).
     Let L2d (X) be the discrete part of L2 (X), defined as in the beginning of
Section 12. It follows from [2], Thm. 1.5, that the space L2d (X) admits a decom-
position as an orthogonal direct sum of closed G-invariant subspaces on each
of which D(X) acts by scalars (in the distribution sense). Let b be a θ-stable
Cartan subspace of q. We denote by L(X, b) the collection of infinitesimal char-
acters Λ ∈ b∗C for which the associated character γ( · : Λ) = γb ( · : Λ) of D(X)
occurs as a simultaneous eigenvalue in the decomposition mentioned.
     The elements of the D(X)-module A2 (X : τ ) are D(X)-finite and belong to
L2d (X) ⊗ Vτ . It follows that A2 (X : τ ) splits as an algebraic direct sum of D(X)-
submodules on which the action of D(X) is by infinitesimal characters from
L(X, b). More precisely, for Λ ∈ b∗C we put

        A2 (X : τ : Λ): = {f ∈ A2 (X : τ ) | Df = γ(D : Λ)f, ∀D ∈ D(X)}.

This space is finite dimensional by [2], Lemma 3.9. It depends on Λ through
its class [Λ] in b∗C /W (b); we therefore also denote it with [Λ] in place of Λ. Let
L(b, τ ) = L(X, b, τ ) denote the collection of Λ ∈ b∗C for which A2 (X : τ : Λ) 6= 0.
Then L(b, τ ) is a W (b)-invariant subset of L(X, b) and we have the following
algebraic direct sum decomposition into joint eigenspaces for D(X),
                                         M
                       A2 (X : τ ) =             A2 (X : τ : Λ).               (14.7)
                                   Λ∈L(b,τ )/W (b)


                                          64
The summands in this decomposition are finite dimensional and mutually or-
thogonal with respect to the inner product from L2 (X : τ ). Moreover, the de-
composition is finite by Lemma 12.6. In the chain of reasoning leading up to
Theorem 21.2, finiteness of the decomposition requires (G, H) to be of residue
type, see Remark 12.2.

Lemma 14.2 Let b1 , b2 ⊂ q be two θ-stable Cartan subspaces. Each element s
from W (b2 | b1 ), which set is non-empty by Lemma 3.8, maps L(b1 , τ ) bijectively
onto L(b2 , τ ).

Proof: This follows by application of Lemma 3.8.                                     

Lemma 14.3 Let P ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ). Then aP ∩ Ad(v)q = aP q .

Proof: aP ∩Ad(v)q = Ad(v)(av−1 P v ∩q) = Ad(v)(av−1 P v ∩aq ) = aP ∩aq = aP q .

     Let now b be a Cartan subspace of q containing aq and let v ∈ NK (aq ). Then
bv : = Ad(v)b is a Cartan subspace of Ad(v)q, which contains aq . In particular,
bv contains aP q , hence is contained in the latter’s centralizer m1P . We write
∗
  bP,v : = bv ∩ mP . Then
                                bv = ∗ bP,v ⊕ aP q .
In view of Lemma 14.3 this is the analogue of the decomposition (2.6) for the
Cartan subspace bv related to symmetric pair (m1P , m1P ∩ Ad(v)h). The restric-
tion of Ad(v) to b determines an element of Hom(b, bv ) that we denote by v̄.
The restriction v̄|aq is an element of W. The latter set equals W (aq | aq ), by
Corollary 3.5; hence, by Lemma 3.7, applied with b, aq , aq in place of d, b1 , b2 ,
there exists an element s ∈ W (b) such that s = v̄ on aq . It readily follows that
v̄ ◦ s−1 ∈ Hom(b, bv ) equals the identity on aP q , hence maps ∗ bP isomorphically
onto ∗ bP,v . Note that this map maps W (∗ bP )-orbits onto W (∗ bP,v )-orbits. The
induced map from ∗ b∗P C /W (∗ bP ) to (∗ bP,v )∗C /W (∗ bP,v ) is bijective and depends
on v, but is independent of the particular choice of s. Given Λ ∈ ∗ b∗P C , we define

                    A2 (XP,v : τP : Λ): = A2 (XP,v : τP : v̄ ◦ s−1 Λ).           (14.8)

Moreover, we define LP,v (b, τ ) to be the set of Λ ∈ ∗ b∗P C for which the above
space is non-trivial. Then

                        v̄ ◦ s−1 LP,v (b, τ ) = L(XP,v , ∗ bP,v , τP ).          (14.9)

Thus, LP,v (b, τ ) is a W (∗ bP )-invariant subset of ∗ b∗P C .

Corollary 14.4 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ and let b ⊂ q be a θ-stable Cartan subspace
containing aq . Then
                  M       M
         A2,P =                     iP,v A2 (XP,v : τP : Λ),       (14.10)

with a finite orthogonal direct sum of finite dimensional spaces. If D ∈ D(X)
and ν ∈ a∗P qC , then for every v ∈ P W and Λ ∈ LP,v (b, τ ),
            µP,v (D : ν) = γb (D : Λ + ν)I           on     iP,v A2 (XP,v : τP : Λ).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type,
see Remark 12.2. By (13.1) the space A2,P is the orthogonal direct sum of the
spaces A2 (XP,v : τP ), as v ∈ P W. Fix v ∈ P W. By the assumption on P, the pair
(MP , MP ∩ vP v −1 ) is of residue type, hence A2 (XP,v : τP ) is finite dimensional
and by (14.7) it is the orthogonal direct sum of the spaces A2 (XP,v : τP : Λ′ ),
with Λ′ ∈ L(XP,v , ∗ bP,v , τP )/W (∗ bP,v ). It now follows from (14.8) and (14.9)
that A2 (XP,v : τP ) is the orthogonal direct sum of the spaces A2 (XP,v : τP : Λ),
for Λ ∈ LP,v (b, τ )/W (∗ bP ); moreover, the sum is finite and the summands are
finite dimensional. This establishes (14.10), with the asserted properties.
    Let Λ ∈ LP,v (b, τ ). Then by (14.9), Λ′ : = v̄s−1 Λ belongs to L(XP,v , ∗ bP,v , τP ).
Let now ψ ∈ A2 (XP,v : τP : Λ). Then, writing Dv = Ad(v)D for D ∈ D(X),
                   µP,v (D : ν)ψ     =    µvP (Dv : ν)ψ
                                            X
                                     =    γ∗ bP,v
                                              P,v
                                                  (µvP (Dv : ν) : Λ′ )ψ
                                            X
                                     =    γbv1P,v (µvP (Dv ) : Λ′ + ν)ψ.
                                                     X         X
In the last equation we have used that γbv1P,v = γ∗ bP,v
                                                     P,v
                                                         ⊗ I, in accordance with
                                               −1 v
(14.3). Combining (14.1) for the triple (G/vHv , b , P ) in place of (G/H, b, P )
with (14.2), we obtain that
                                          G/vHv −1
                  µP,v (D : ν)ψ     =    γb v            (Dv : Λ′ + ν)ψ

                                    =    γb (D : s ◦ Ad(v)−1 (Λ′ + ν))ψ
                                    =    γb (D : Λ + ν)ψ.
                                                                                           

  We define LP (b, τ ) ⊂      to be the union of the sets LP,v (b, τ ), for v ∈ W.

Moreover, for Λ in this union, we put
                                M
                   A2,P (Λ): =        iP,v A2 (XP,v : τP : Λ).

Corollary 14.5 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then

Moreover, if Λ ∈ LP (b, τ ) and ψ ∈ A2,P (Λ), then, for every D ∈ D(X),
                     DE ◦ (P : ν)ψ = γb (D : Λ + ν)E ◦ (P : ν)ψ,
as a meromorphic C ∞ (X : τ )-valued identity in ν ∈ a∗P qC .

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. The result follows from Corollary 14.4 combined with Lemma
14.1.                                                                     
   We end this section with a description of the action of D(X) on the dualized
Eisenstein integral. For D ∈ D(X) we define the formal adjoint D∗ ∈ D(X) by

                               hDf | gi = hf | D∗ gi,                       (14.11)

for all f, g ∈ Cc∞ (X); here h · | · i denotes the inner product from L2 (X). The
canonical anti-automorphism X 7→ X ∨ of U (g) induces an anti-automorphism of
U (g)H /U (g)H ∩ U (g)h ≃ D(X), which we also denote by D 7→ D∨ . If D ∈ D(X),
let D̄ be its complex conjugate, i.e. the differential operator with complex
conjugate coefficients. Then D∗ = D̄∨ , for every D ∈ D(X).
    We recall from [3], Lemma 7.2, that D restricts to a continuous linear en-
domorphism of C(X); by density of Cc∞ (X) in C(X) it follows that (14.11) also
holds for all f, g ∈ C(X).

Lemma 14.6 Let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ) and D ∈ D(X). Then

                              µP,v (D∗ ) = µP,v (D)∗ .                      (14.12)

Proof: We note that µP,e = µP ; hence, for v = e, the result follows by the
same argument as in [5], proof of Lemma 19.3. For general v the result follows
by application of (14.2).                                                   

Lemma 14.7 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then, for every D ∈ D(X) and all ν ∈ a∗P qC ,

                           µP (D : ν)∗ = µP (D∗ : −ν̄).                     (14.13)

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Let v ∈ P W. The decomposition X1P,v ≃ XP,v × AP q induces
an isomorphism D(X1P,v ) ≃ D(XP,v ) ⊗ S(aP q ). Accordingly (u ⊗ p)∗ = u∗ ⊗ p∗ ,
for all u ∈ D(XP,v ) and p ∈ S(aP q ). Moreover, p∗ (ν) = p(−ν̄), for ν ∈ a∗P qC .
Hence, (u⊗p)∗ (ν) = p(−ν̄)u∗ = [u⊗p(−ν̄)]∗ and we see that u∗ (ν) = u(−ν̄)∗ for
u ∈ D(X1P,v ) and ν ∈ a∗P qC . Applying this to (14.12) it follows that for D ∈ D(X)
and ν ∈ a∗P qC we have µP,v (D : ν)∗ = µP,v (D∗ : −ν̄). By the argument in the
text preceding Lemma 14.6, applied to XP,v in place of X, we infer that

                    hµP,v (D : ν)f | gi = hf | µP,v (D∗ : −ν̄)gi,

for all f, g ∈ C(XP,v : τP ). Here h · | · i denotes the L2 -inner product. In par-
ticular, the equation holds for f, g in the subspace A2 (X : τP ), which is finite
dimensional, since P is of residue type. Hence, µP,v (D : ν)∗ = µP,v (D∗ : −ν̄).
By orthogonality of the direct sum decomposition in (13.1), the result follows
by summation over v ∈ P W.                                                       

Lemma 14.8 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then for every D ∈ D(X),

                       DE ∗ (P : ν) = µP (D∨ : ν)E ∗ (P : ν),

as a meromorphic identity in ν ∈ a∗P qC .

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. By linearity, we may assume that D is real. It then follows from
the definition of the dual Eisenstein integral, see Definition 13.7, combined with
Lemma 14.1, that

                      DE ∗ (P : ν) = µP (D : −ν̄)∗ E ∗ (P : ν).

The lemma now follows by application of Lemma 14.7, in view of the fact that
D∗ = D∨ .                                                                 


15      Uniform tempered estimates
In this section we present straightforward generalizations of results of [5], Sect.
18, to a setting involving families {fν } of eigenfunctions on X, with holomorphic
dependence on a parameter ν ∈ a∗QqC , where Q ∈ Pσ . A similar generalization
has been given in [22], Sect. 9. The generalized results allow us to sharpen
uniformly moderate estimates of type (13.9) to uniform tempered estimates. In
particular, we obtain estimates of the latter type for the normalized Eisenstein
integral.
    We fix Q ∈ Pσ , a θ-stable Cartan subspace b of q containing aq and an
element Λ ∈ ∗ b∗QC , cf. (2.6). For ε > 0, we put

                       a∗Qq (ε): = {X ∈ a∗QqC | |Re X| < ε}.

The closure of this set is denoted by ā∗Qq (ε).
Definition 15.1 Let ε > 0. We define E(Q : Λ : ε) = E(X : Q : Λ : ε) to be the
space of smooth functions f : a∗Qq (ε)× X → C satisfying the following conditions.
 (a) The function f is holomorphic in its first variable.
 (b) For every ν ∈ a∗Qq (ε), the function fν : x 7→ f (ν, x) satisfies the following
     system of differential equations

                        Dfν = γ(D : Λ + ν)fν ,        (D ∈ D(X)).

Note that in this definition it is not required that f is K-finite, or spherical,
from the left. We also have the following analogue of the space M(Λ, ε) defined
in [5], Sect. 18.




                                         68
Definition 15.2 Let ε > 0. A function f ∈ E(Q : Λ : ε) is called uniformly
moderate of exponential rate r ≥ 0 if for every u ∈ U (g) there exist constants
n ∈ N and C > 0 such that

                          kLu fν (x)k ≤ C(1 + |ν|)n erlX (x) ,

for all ν ∈ a∗Qq (ε) and x ∈ X. The space of all such functions is denoted by
E um (Q : Λ : ε : r).

Lemma 15.3 (RT) Let Q ∈ Pσ and let ε > 0. There exists a polynomial
function p ∈ ΠΣr (Q),R (a∗Qq ) such that the C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(A2,Q , Vτ )-valued mero-
morphic function ν 7→ p(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν) is regular on ā∗Qq (ε) and such that the
following holds. There exists a constant r > 0 such that for every Λ ∈ LQ (b, τ ),
ψ ∈ A2,Q (Λ) and η ∈ Vτ∗ , the family f : (ν, x) 7→ η(p(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν : x)) belongs to
E um (Q : Λ : ε : r).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that Q is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Let R > 0 be such that a∗Qq (ε) ⊂ a∗Qq (Q̄, R). Then by Propo-
sition 13.14 there exists a polynomial function p ∈ ΠΣr (Q) (a∗Qq ) such that the
C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(A2,Q , Vτ )-valued meromorphic function F : ν 7→ p(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν) is
holomorphic on a neighborhood of ā∗Qq (Q̄, R). Moreover, there exists r′ > 0 and
for every u ∈ U (g) constants n ∈ N and C > 0 such that
                                                    ′
                     kLu Fν (x)k ≤ C(1 + |ν|)n e(r +|Re ν|)lX (x) ,

for x ∈ X, ν ∈ ā∗Qq (Q̄, R). Put r = r′ + ε. Then it follows that F is holomorphic
on a neighborhood of ā∗Qq (ε) and satisfies the estimates

                          kLu Fν (x)k ≤ C(1 + |ν|)n erlX (x)                     (15.1)

for x ∈ X and ν ∈ a∗Qq (ε). Let f be defined as in the lemma. Then Lu fν (x) =
η(Lu Fν (x)ψ). Hence, it follows from the above and from Corollary 14.5 that f ∈
E(Q : Λ : ε). Finally, it follows from the estimates (15.1) that f ∈ E um (Q : Λ : ε : r).

   We also have the following obvious generalization of the notion of uniformly
tempered families; see [5], Sect. 18. For ν ∈ a∗QqC and x ∈ X we put

                           |(ν, x)|: = (1 + |ν|)(1 + lX (x)).

Definition 15.4 Let ε > 0. A function f ∈ E(Q : Λ : ε) is called uniformly
tempered of scale s if for every u ∈ U (g) there exist constants n ∈ N and C > 0
such that
                     |Lu fν (x)| ≤ C|(ν, x)|n Θ(x)es|Re ν|lX (x) ,
for all ν ∈ a∗Qq (ε) and all x ∈ X. The space of all such functions is denoted by
T (Q : Λ : ε : s).



                                          69
   If f ∈ E um (Q : Λ : ε : r), then for every ν ∈ a∗QqC the function fν belongs to
            ∞
the space EΛ+ν,∗  (X), defined in [5], p. 392, see also p. 387. If g is any function in
the latter space, then, viewed as a function on G, it has an asymptotic expansion
along every parabolic subgroup P ∈ Pσ of the form
                                      X
                 g(x exp tX) ∼                 pξ (P | g, x, X)etξ(X) ,
                                    ξ∈Z−N∆r (P )


as t → ∞, for x ∈ G and X ∈ a+                                        ∗
                                  P q . Here Z is a finite subset of aP qC and there
exists a d ∈ N such that the pξ (P | g) are smooth functions G → Pd (aP q ), for all
ξ. Moreover, the functions pξ (P | g) are uniquely determined, see [5], Theorem
12.8. Accordingly, we may define the set of exponents of g along the parabolic
subgroup P by

                Exp (P | g): = {ξ ∈ Z − N∆r (P ) |          pξ (P | g) 6= 0}.          (15.2)

We define the partial ordering P on a∗P qC by

                    λ P µ ⇐⇒ µ − λ ∈ ∆r (P ),              (λ, µ ∈ a∗P qC ).

The P -maximal elements in the set (15.2) are called the leading exponents of
g along P. The set of these leading exponents is denoted by Exp L (P | g).

Remark 15.5 The above notions of asymptotic coefficients and exponents are
related to the similar notions introduced in § 6, as follows.
    Let f ∈ A(X : τ ) and assume that every vector component η ◦ f, for η ∈ Vτ∗ ,
              ∞
belongs to EΛ+ν,∗   (X). For P ∈ Pσ , let Exp (f | P ) denote the union of the sets
Exp (η ◦ f | P ), for η ∈ Vτ∗ ; by sphericality of f this union equals the union with
index η ranging over any generating subset of the K-module Vτ∗ . If u ∈ NK (aq ),
then it readily follows from the definitions that Exp (P, u | f ) ⊂ Exp (P | f ).
Moreover, by uniqueness of asymptotics we have, for ξ ∈ Exp (P, u | f ), that

      η(qξ (P, u | f, X, m)) = pξ (P | η ◦ f, mu, X),          (m ∈ MP , X ∈ aP q ),

for all η ∈ Vτ∗ .

Lemma 15.6 Let ν ∈ a∗QqC and assume that g ∈ EΛ+ν,∗ ∞
                                                          (X). Let P ∈ Pσmin .
Then for every ξ ∈ Exp L (P | g) there exists a s ∈ W (b) such that ξ + ρP =
s(ν + Λ)|aq .

Proof: We recall that aq ⊂ b. Let Σ+ (b) be a choice of positive roots for Σ(b)
that is compatible with Σ(P ). Let g+       C be the associated sum of the positive root
spaces and let m+     C
                          be its intersection  with mC . Let δ: = 12 tr [ad( · )|g+ ] ∈ b∗C and
                                                                                  C
let δ0 : = 21 tr [ad( · )|m+ ] ∈ ib∗k . Then δ = δ0 + ρP .
                           C
    Let ξ be a leading exponent along P. Then by [5], Cor. 13.3 and Lemma
13.1, the function ϕ ∈ C ∞ (M1 ) defined by

              ϕ(ma) = aξ pξ (P | g, m, log a),           (m ∈ Mσ , a ∈ Aq ),

                                              70
is right Mσ ∩ H-invariant and satisfies the following system of differential equa-
tions
                  µ′P (D)ϕ = γ(D : Λ + ν)ϕ,        (D ∈ D(X)).
Here µ′P is defined as in [5], Sect. 2. Now Mσ /Mσ ∩H ≃ M10 /M10 ∩H, naturally,
so that ϕ may be viewed as a function in C ∞ (X10 ). By (14.3) with P = P0 and
v = e we have D(X10 ) ≃ D(X0 ) ⊗ S(aq ). Since pξ is polynomial in log a, the
second component of the tensor product acts on ϕ with a single generalized
eigenvalue u 7→ u(ξ). On the other hand, we recall from [5], Lemma 4.8, that
the action of D(X0 ) on C ∞ (X0 )K0 allows a simultaneous diagonalization with
eigenvalues of the form D 7→ γ X0 (D : Λ0 + δ0 ), with Λ0 ∈ ib∗k . It follows that
there exists a Λ0 ∈ ib∗k such that

           γ X0 (µ′P (D : ξ) : Λ0 + δ0 ) = γ(D : Λ + ν),      (D ∈ D(X)).

The expression on the left-hand side of this expression can be rewritten as
γP (D : Λ0 + ξ + δ0 + ρP ) = γ(D : Λ0 + ξ + δ), from which we conclude that
Λ0 + ξ + δ ∈ W (b)(Λ + ν). Since (Λ0 + δ)|aq = ρP , it follows that ξ + ρP =
s(ν + Λ)|aq , for some s ∈ W (b).                                          
   We can now generalize [5], Theorem 18.3. For an appropriate formulation
we need the following definition.

Definition 15.7 We say that the exponents of a family f ∈ E um (Q : Λ : ε : r)
are tempered along a minimal σ-parabolic subgroup P ∈ Pσmin if for every
ν ∈ a∗Qq (ε) the set of exponents Exp (P | fν ) satisfies the following condition.
For every ξ ∈ Exp (P | fν ), there exists a s ∈ W (b) such that
 (a) Re (sΛ) ≤ 0 on a+
                     q (P ),

 (b) ξ ∈ s(ν + Λ)|aq − ρP − N∆(P ).
We denote by ETum (Q : Λ : ε : r) the space of functions f ∈ E um (Q : Λ : ε : r),
such that for every P ∈ Pσmin the exponents of f along P are tempered.

Remark 15.8 If Q is a minimal σ-parabolic subgroup, then it follows by
application of [5], Thm. 13.7, that E um (Q : Λ : ε : r) = ETum (Q : Λ : ε : r).

Theorem 15.9 Let Q ∈ Pσ and let r > 0. Then there exists a s > 0 such that
for sufficiently small ε > 0,

                       ETum (Q : Λ : ε : r) ⊂ T (Q : Λ : ε : s).

Proof: The proof is a straightforward, but somewhat tedious, adaptation of
the proof of [5], Theorem 18.3, with trivial alterations because of the change
of the parameter set. Conditions (a) and (b) of Definition 15.7 are to be used
in place of [5], Theorem 13.7, see the proof of [5], Proposition 18.14, to keep
track of the exponents occurring in the asymptotic expansions considered. If Q
is minimal, then the mentioned Theorem 13.7 implies conditions (a) and (b) for
any family f ∈ E um (Q : Λ : ε : r); see Remark 15.8.                        

                                          71
Remark 15.10 Another version of Theorem 15.9 is given by [22], Thm. 3.
However, in that paper the requirement on the exponents in Definition 15.7 is
replaced by the requirement that the function fν is tempered for every ν ∈ ia∗q .
By an additional argument it is then shown that this requirement is equivalent
to the one of Definition 15.7, see [22], Lemma 23. We shall not need this result,
since by Proposition 13.15 the needed information on the exponents is known
for the normalized Eisenstein integrals to which Theorem 15.9 will be applied.

Definition 15.11 Let Q ∈ Pσ , Λ ∈ ∗ b∗QC , ε > 0 and s > 0. Then by
T (Q, τ, Λ, ε, s) we denote the space of smooth functions f : a∗Qq (ε) × X → Vτ
such that
 (a) for every η ∈ Vτ∗ the family η ◦ f : (ν, x) 7→ η(f (ν, x)) belongs to T (Q, Λ, ε, s);
 (b) fν is τ -spherical for every ν ∈ a∗Qq (ε).

Theorem 15.12 (RT) Let Q ∈ Pσ . There exists a polynomial function p ∈
ΠΣr (Q),R (a∗Qq ) and constants s > 0 and ε > 0 such that the meromorphic
C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(A2,Q , Vτ )-valued function ν 7→ p(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν) is holomorphic on
a∗Qq (ε), and such that the following holds. For each Λ ∈ LQ (b, τ ) and every
ψ ∈ A2,Q (Λ) the family f : (ν, x) 7→ p(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν : x)ψ belongs to T (Q, τ, Λ, ε, s).

Remark 15.13 For Q minimal, this result is due [5], Thm. 19.2, in view of
[9], Eqn. (52). For general Q, a similar result for an unnormalized version of
the Eisenstein integral is due to [22], Thm. 4.

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that Q is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Fix ε > 0. There exist p ∈ ΠΣr (Q),R (a∗Qq ) and r > 0 as in Lemma
15.3. Fix Λ ∈ LQ (b, τ ) and ψ ∈ A2,Q (Λ). Define f : (ν, x) 7→ p(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν : x)ψ.
Let η ∈ Vτ∗ and define F : (ν, x) 7→ η(f (ν, x)). Then by finite dimensionality of
A2,Q and Vτ it suffices to show that there exist ε′ > 0 and s > 0 such that
F ∈ T (Q : Λ : ε′ : s).
   In view of Theorem 15.9 it suffices to show that F ∈ ETum (Q : Λ : ε : r). In
view of Lemma 15.3 the function F belongs to E um (Q : Λ : ε : r). Let P ∈ Pσmin .
Then it remains to be verified that the exponents of F along P are tempered in
the sense of Definition 15.7.
   There exists a v ∈ NK (aq ) such that P1 : = v −1 P v ⊂ Q. The meromor-
phic C ∞ (X : τ )-valued function ν 7→ fν is regular on a∗Qq (ε). Moreover, from
Proposition 13.15 and [14], Lemma 3.6, it follows that, for ν ∈ reg f,

 Exp (P, e | fν ) = vExp (P1 , v −1 | fν ) ⊂ vW P1 |Q (ν + Λ(P1 |Q)) − ρP − N∆(P ).

Thus, let ν0 ∈ a∗Qq (ε) be fixed, and let ξ ∈ Exp (P | Fν0 ). Then we may select
s ∈ vW P1 |Q and ξ0 ∈ −sΛ(P1 |Q) + N∆(P ) such that ξ = sν0 − ρP − ξ0 . Since
f ∈ EQ (X : τ ), see Definition 13.7, it follows from Definitions 6.6, 6.4 and 6.3
            ep,hyp
that f ∈ CQ,Y      (X+ : τ ), for a suitable finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC . By Definition
6.1 and [14], Lemma 6.2, it follows that sν − ρP − ξ0 ∈ Exp (P, e | fν ), for ν in
an open dense subset of a∗QqC .

                                          72
   Let ξ1 be a P -minimal element in −sΛ(P1 |Q) + N∆(P ) with the property
that ξ1 P ξ0 and that sν − ξ1 − ρP ∈ Exp (P, e | fν ) for ν in an open dense
subset of a∗QqC . Then for ν in an open dense subset Ω of a∗QqC , the element
sν − ξ1 − ρP is a leading exponent of fν along (P, e). By Lemma 15.6 it follows
that
                      sν − ξ1 − ρP ∈ W (b)(ν + Λ)|aq − ρP ,
for ν ∈ Ω. This implies in turn that there exists t ∈ W (b) such that sν − ξ1 =
t(ν + Λ)|aq , for all ν ∈ a∗QqC . Hence, sν = tν|aq for all ν ∈ a∗QqC and −ξ1 = tΛ|aq .
Now −ξ1 ∈ sΛ(P1 |Q) − N∆(P ) ⊂ −s(R+ ∆Q (P1 )) − N∆(P ) ⊂ −R+ ∆(P ), hence
Re (tΛ)|aq = −ξ1 ≤ 0 on a+    q (P ). We complete the proof by observing that

  ξ = sν − ρP − ξ0 = sν − ξ1 − ρP − (ξ0 − ξ1 ) ∈ t(ν + Λ)|aq − ρP − N∆(P ).

                                                                                     


16      Infinitesimal characters of the discrete series
In this section we describe a restriction on the set L(X, b) of D(X)-characters
of the discrete series, see the text before (14.7). The main result is due to T.
Oshima and T. Matsuki, [40].
    Let b ⊂ q be a θ-stable Cartan subalgebra. If Λ ∈ b∗C then by IΛ we denote
the kernel of γb ( · : Λ) in D(X). We denote by C(X : Λ) the space of L2 -Schwartz
functions on X annihilated by IΛ . If C(X : Λ) is non-trivial, then it contains a
non-trivial K-finite function f. By a well known result of Harish-Chandra, the
closed G-span of f in L2 (X) is a subrepresentation of finite length; see [41],
p. 312, Thm. 12 and [42], p. 112, Thm. 4.2.1. Therefore, the mentioned closed
G-span is contained in L2d (X) and we deduce that Λ ∈ L(X, b). Conversely, if
Λ ∈ L(X, b), then there exists a non-trivial K-finite function f ∈ L2d (X) that is
annihilated by IΛ . From [3], Thm. 7.3, it follows that f belongs to C(X : Λ) and
we see that the latter space is non-trivial. We conclude that

                        L(X, b) = {Λ ∈ b∗C | C(X : Λ) 6= 0}.                    (16.1)

Theorem 16.1 Assume that the space L2d (X) is non-trivial. Then there exists
a compact Cartan subspace t ⊂ q. Moreover, each Λ ∈ L(X, t) belongs to it∗ and
is regular with respect to Σ(t).

Remark 16.2 This result, which plays a crucial role in the description of the
constant term of the normalized Eisenstein integral in Section 17, is essentially
due to T. Oshima and M. Matsuki, [40]. However, we have to be a bit care-
ful here, since in our situation G is assumed to be of Harish-Chandra’s class,
whereas in [40] it is assumed that G is semisimple.

Proof: Fix a Cartan subspace b ⊂ q that is fundamental, i.e., its compact part
bk = b ∩ k is of maximal dimension. Then the assumption that L2d (X) is non-
trivial is equivalent to the assumption that L(X, b) is non-empty. We must show

                                          73
that under this assumption b is compact, and all elements of L(X, b) belong to
ib∗ and are regular.
      Let X◦ = Ge /Ge ∩H be the connected component of the origin in X. If Λ ∈ b∗C
then restriction defines a linear map r: C(X : Λ) → C(X◦ : Λ). Conversely, exten-
sion by zero defines a linear embedding j: C(X◦ : Λ) → C(X : Λ). Now r ◦ j = I,
hence r is surjective. If the space C(X : Λ) is non-trivial, then by G-invariance
it follows that r is non-zero, hence its image is non-trivial. On the other hand,
if C(X◦ : Λ) is non-trivial, then C(X : Λ) is non-trivial, by injectivity of j. Thus,
from (16.1) we see that L(X, b) = L(X◦ , b). Therefore, we may as well assume
that G is connected.
      Let a∆q be the intersection in aq of the root spaces ker α, α ∈ Σ. This space
is central in g. Hence, a∆q ⊂ b and the group A∆q : = exp a∆q is central in G.
      The algebra U (a∆q ) naturally embeds into D(X) and into I(b); accordingly,
γ restricts to the identity on U (a∆q ). Let Λ ∈ L(X, b) and let f be a non-trivial
function in C(X : Λ). Then it follows that RX f = Λ(X)f for all X ∈ a∆q . Let
Λ0 : = Λ|a∆q . Then it follows that f (ax) = aΛ0 f (x) for all x ∈ X and a ∈ A∆q .
Since f is a non-trivial Schwartz function, this implies that a∆q = 0.
      Let c be the center of g. Then it follows that cq : = c∩q is contained in b∩k. Let
g1 : = [g, g]. Then b = cq ⊕b1 , with b1 = b∩g1 . Accordingly, I(b) = U (cq )⊗I(b1 ).
      Let G1 be the analytic subgroup of G with Lie algebra g1 and let H1 =
G1 ∩ H. The embeddings cq ⊂ g and g1 ⊂ g induce embeddings U (cq ) ⊂ D(X)
and D(G1 /H1 ) ⊂ D(X), via which we identify. Accordingly, D(X) = U (cq ) ⊗
D(G1 /H1 ); moreover, the map γ: D(X) → I(b) corresponds with the tensor
product of IU(cq ) and γ1 , the Harish-Chandra isomorphism for (G1 , H1 , b1 ).
      If Λ ∈ L(X, b), let Λc : = Λ|cq and Λ1 : = Λ|b1 . Then U (cq ) ≃ S(cq ) acts by the
character Λc on the non-trivial space C(X : Λ). This character must therefore
be an infinitesimal character of the compact group exp(cq ), hence belongs to
ic∗q . On the other hand, D(G1 /H1 ) acts by the character γ1 ( · : Λ1 ) on C(X : Λ).
Restriction to G1 /H1 therefore induces a map C(X : Λ) → C(G1 /H1 , Λ1 ), which
is non-zero by G-invariance and non-triviality of the space C(X : Λ). Hence,
Λ1 ∈ L(G1 /H1 , b1 ). If b1 is contained in k, then so is b and if Λ1 ∈ ib∗1 then
Λ = Λc + Λ1 ∈ ib∗ ; finally, if Λ1 is regular, then so is Λ. Therefore, we may as
well assume that g is semisimple from the start.
      Let Z(G) denote the center of G and put ZH : = Z(G) ∩ H. Since ZH is
discrete and central, 8 G: = G/ZH is a Lie group with algebra naturally iso-
morphic with g. The involution σ factors to an involution 8 σ of 8 G. Moreover,
                                                                                 8
8
  H: = H/ZH , viewed as a subgroup of 8 G, is an open subgroup of 8 G σ . The
associated symmetric space 8 X: = 8 G/8 H is naturally diffeomorphic with X and
it is readily seen that L(X, b) = L(8 X, b). Therefore, it suffices to prove the
assertions for 8 X and we see that we may as well assume from the start that
ZH = {e}.
      From now on we assume that G is connected and semisimple, and that
ZH = {e}. The natural map π: G/He → G/H is a finite covering, hence induces
a linear embedding π ∗ : C(G/H) → C(G/He ) by pull-back. Via the isomorphism
(2.5) we may identify the algebras D(G/H) and D(G/He ), so that π ∗ (Df ) =
Dπ ∗ f, for f ∈ C(G/H). Thus, if Λ ∈ L(X, b), then the image of C(G/H : Λ)

                                           74
in C(G/He ) is a non-trivial subspace annihilated by the ideal IΛ , from which
we see that Λ ∈ L(G/He , b). It follows that we may as well assume that H is
connected. We will do so from now on.
     Let gd be the dual real form of gC defined as in Section 2. Via ad we identify
gC with the Lie algebra of the complex adjoint group GC of G; accordingly,
we denote by Gd , K d and H d the analytic subgroups of GC with Lie algebras
gd , kd and hd , respectively. Via Ad we may identify K ∩ H with a connected
subgroup of GC . Accordingly, the map (k, X) 7→ k exp X is a diffeomorphism
from (K ∩H)×i[k∩q] onto H d . Hence, for every finite dimensional representation
(π, V ) of K there exists a unique finite dimensional representation (π d , V ) of H d
such that the infinitesimal representations associated with π and π d have the
same complex linear extension to kC . It follows that Flensted-Jensen’s dualization
procedure, see [25], Thm. 2.3, defines an injective linear map f 7→ f d (denoted
f 7→ f η in [25]) from the space C ∞ (G/H)K of K-finite smooth functions on
G/H into the space C ∞ (Gd /K d )H d of H d -finite smooth functions on Gd /K d .
The map is determined by the property that, for every f ∈ C ∞ (G/H)K and all
u ∈ U (kC ),
                                L u f |A q = L u f d |A q .
We note that the left H d -types of f d are all of the form π d , with π a finite dimen-
sional irreducible representation of K. We also note that for f ∈ C ∞ (G/H)K ,
the condition f ∈ L2 (G/H) can be entirely rephrased in terms of the function
f d ; in fact it is equivalent to the condition that Lu f d |Aq ∈ L2 (Aq , J da), for all
u ∈ U (k), with J the Jacobian associated with the decomposition G = KAq H,
see [10], (3.1).
     Let D 7→ Dd denote the natural algebra isomorphism from D(X) onto D(Xd ),
corresponding to (2.5). Then (Df )d = Dd f d , for every f ∈ C ∞ (G/H)K . More-
over, we recall from the text after (2.5) that Dd = γadp −1 ◦ γb (D), where we have
written adp for the maximal abelian subspace d b = bC ∩ gd of pd . Now assume
that Λ ∈ L(X, b). Then there exists a non-trivial K-finite function f ∈ C(X : Λ).
It follows that f d ∈ C ∞ (Gd /K d )H d satisfies the system of differential equations
Df d = γadp (D : Λ)f d , for D ∈ D(Gd /K d).
     It follows from the above discussion, that the theorem of [40], p. 359, as
well as its proof, can be entirely formulated in terms of the function f d , and
therefore applies without change, see [40], p. 388, note (i) added in proof. In
particular, we may draw the following conclusions. In the notation of the cited
theorem, we may take adp as above, and we may select a positive system Σ(adp )+
for Σ(gd , adp ) such that Re Λ is dominant. The hypothesis of part (i) of the
cited theorem is fulfilled, since the non-trivial function f belongs to the space
AK (G/H, Mλ ) ∩ L2 (G/H), with λ = Λ. It follows that b is compact, i.e., is
contained in k ∩ q. In the cited theorem we may now take t = b and a′p = ib.
Thus, adp = a′p , and it follows from part (i) of the cited theorem that Λ is regular.
     We note that W (a′p | adp ) = W (adp ), so that the elements x̄j = Ad(xj )|adp
of the cited theorem belong to W (adp ). It follows from part (iii) of the cited
theorem that, for some j, the element x̄j Λ = λj belongs to ad∗        p . This implies

                ∗
that Λ ∈ ad∗
          p = ib .                                                                        

Corollary 16.3 Let b ⊂ q be a θ-stable Cartan subspace. If L(X, b) 6= ∅
then there exists a Cartan subspace t ⊂ q with t ⊂ k. Moreover, let t be an
element of the set W (t | b), which is non-empty by Lemma 3.8. Then, for every
Λ ∈ L(X, b), the element tΛ belongs to it∗ and is regular relative to the root
system Σ(t).

Proof: Assume that L(X, b) 6= ∅. Then, by definition, L2d (X) 6= 0. By Theorem
16.1 there exists a compact Cartan subspace t ⊂ q. Let t ∈ W (b, t). Then by
Lemma 14.2 the element t maps L(X, t) bijectively onto L(X, b). The assertion
now follows from Theorem 16.1.                                               
   In the rest of this section we fix a Cartan subspace b ⊂ q containing aq . If
P ∈ Pσ , then the θ-stable Cartan subspace ∗ bP of mP ∩ q is defined as in the
text before (2.6).

Lemma 16.4 Let P ∈ Pσ , v ∈ NK (aq ) and assume that LP,v (b, τ ) 6= ∅. Then
there exist a Cartan subspace b̂ ⊂ m1v−1 P v ∩ q and an element t ∈ W (b̂ | b) with
the following properties.
 (a) ∗ b̂: = b̂ ∩ mv−1 P v is compact, i.e., contained in k;
 (b) t = Ad(v)−1 on aP q ;

  (c) the elements of tLP,v (b, τ ) belong to i ∗ b̂∗ and are regular relative to Σ(mv−1 P vC , ∗ b̂).

Proof: From (14.9) it follows that L(XP,v , ∗ bP,v , τP ) 6= ∅. Hence, by Corollary
16.3 there exists a Cartan subspace t of mP ∩ Ad(v)(q) that is contained in k.
Now b̂ = Ad(v)−1 (t ⊕ aP q ) is a Cartan subspace of m1v−1 P v ∩ q that satisfies
condition (a), with ∗ b̂ = Ad(v)−1 t.
    Fix t1 ∈ W (b̂ | b). Then t−1  1 Ad(v)
                                            −1
                                               aP q ⊂ d b. Since d b is maximal abelian
in pd , it follows from Lemma 3.1 (d) that there exists a t2 ∈ W (b) such that
t2 = t−1
       1 Ad(v)
                 −1
                    on aP q . It follows that t = t1 t2 ∈ W (b̂ | b) satisfies requirement
(b).
    Finally, let Λ ∈ LP,v (b, τ ). Then, in the notation of (14.9), the element Λ′ : =
Ad(v)s−1 Λ belongs to L(XP,v , ∗ bP,v , τP ). The element t′ = Ad(v)tsAd(v)−1
belongs to W (b̂v | bv ) and equals the identity on aP q , hence restricts to an
element of W (t | ∗ bP,v ). By Corollary 16.3 it follows that t′ Λ′ belongs to it∗ and
is regular relative to Σ(mP C , t). We now observe that t′ Λ′ = Ad(v)tΛ. Hence, tΛ
belongs to i∗ b̂ and is regular with respect to Σ(mv−1 P vC , ∗ b̂).                    

Remark 16.5 Let P, v, b̂, t be as in Lemma 16.4. Then it follows from Lemma
3.8 that, for all Λ ∈ LP,v (b, τ ), ν ∈ a∗P qC and D ∈ D(X),

                           γb (D : Λ + ν) = γb̂ (D : tΛ + tν).


                                            76
Corollary 16.6 Let P ∈ Pσ and let Λ ∈ LP (b, τ ). Then hΛ , αi ∈ R \ {0}, for
each α ∈ Σ(mP C , ∗ bP ).

Proof: Select v ∈ P W such that Λ ∈ LP,v (b, τ ). Let b̂, t be associated as in
Lemma 16.4. Then by (a) and (b) of the mentioned lemma, t maps b = ∗ bP ⊕aP q
onto b̂ = ∗ b̂⊕av−1 P vq , preserving the decompositions. The assertion now follows
from Lemma 16.4 (a) and (c).                                                     


17     The constant term of the Eisenstein integral
In this section we describe the constant term of the normalized Eisenstein in-
tegral, introduced in Definition 13.7. We start by recalling the notion of the
constant term introduced in [17].
   If f ∈ Atemp (X : τ ), see Def. 10.1, then in particular f ∈ A(X+ : τ ) and f
has an expansion of the form (6.1). It follows from Lemma 10.2 (c) combined
with [14], Thm. 3.5, that, for each Q ∈ Pσ and every v ∈ NK (aq ),

               ξ ∈ Exp (Q, v | f ) ⇒ Re ξ + ρQ ≤ 0        on   a+
                                                                Qq .

We define the function fQ,v : X1Q,v,+ → Vτ by
                                      X
            fQ,v (ma) = dQ (ma)             aξ qξ (Q, v | f, log a, m),
                                   ξ∈Exp (Q,v|f )
                                    Re ξ+ρQ =0


                                                                      p
for m ∈ XQ,v,+ , a ∈ AQq . Here dQ : M1Q → R is defined by dQ (m) = | det Ad(m)|nQ |.
Note that dQ = 1 on MQ and on AQ ∩ H. Hence, dQ factors to a function on
X1Q,v ; in fact, dQ (ma) = aρQ , for m ∈ MQσ and a ∈ AQq .
    We note that, for v ∈ NK (aq ), the function Rv f : x 7→ f (xv) belongs to the
space Atemp (G/vHv −1 : τ ).

Proposition 17.1
 (a) If u, v ∈ NK (aq ), then (Rv f )Q,u = fQ,uv .
 (b) The function fQ,v extends uniquely to smooth function on X1Q,v . This
     extension is the unique function in Atemp (X1Q,v : τQ ) such that

               lim (dQ (m exp tX)f (m exp tXv) − fQ,v (m exp tX)) = 0,
               t→∞

      for every m ∈ M1Q and X ∈ a+
                                 Qq .

Proof: The first assertion follows from [14], Lemma 3.7. In view of (a) it
suffices to prove the second assertion for v = e. In this case the assertion follows
from [17], proof of Thm. 1.                                                       




                                         77
    Thus, for v = e, the function fQ,v coincides with the constant term of f
along Q, introduced by [17], which in turn generalizes Harish-Chandra’s notion
of the constant term for the case of the group, see [30], Sect. 21, Thm. 1. We
shall therefore call fQ,v the constant term of f along (Q, v). The following result,
which generalizes a result of Harish-Chandra, see [30], Sect. 21, Lemma 1, is
essentially given in [17], Thm. 1 (b).

Lemma 17.2 (Transitivity of the constant term) Let P, Q ∈ Pσ be such that
P ⊂ Q. Put ∗1P : = M1Q ∩ P. Let v ∈ NK (aq ) and u ∈ NKQ (aq ). Then

                                 (fQ,v )∗1P,u = fP,uv .

Proof: For v = u = e the result is equivalent to [17], Thm. 1(b). Let now v ∈
NK (aq ) and u ∈ NKQ (aq ) be general. Then right translation by u defines a linear
isomorphism Ru : A(X1Q,v : τQ ) → A(X1Q,uv : τQ ). Hence, applying Proposition
17.1 (b) we find that
                                Ru (fQ,v ) = fQ,uv .                         (17.1)
Applying Proposition 17.1 (a) we see that

        fQ,uv = (Ruv f )Q,e      and       (fQ,v )∗1P,u = (Ru fQ,v )∗1P,e .    (17.2)

Combining (17.1) with (17.2), and using the first line of the proof and Proposi-
tion 17.1 (a), we finally obtain that

               (fQ,v )∗1P,u = ((Ruv f )Q,e )∗1P,e = (Ruv f )P,e = fP,uv .

                                                                                    

    The following transformation rule for the constant term will also be useful to
us. If u, v ∈ NK (aq ), we define the map ρτ,u : C ∞ (X1Q,v : τQ ) → C ∞ (X1uQu−1 ,uv : τuQu−1 )
in accordance with [14], Eqn. (3.24), by

                ρτ,u ϕ(m) = τ (u)ϕ(u−1 mu),          (m ∈ M1uQu−1 ).

One readily checks that ρτ,u maps Atemp (X1Q,v : τQ ) into Atemp (X1uQu−1 ,uv : τuQu−1 ).

Lemma 17.3 Let f ∈ Atemp (X : τ ) and let Q ∈ Pσ and u, v ∈ NK (aq ). Then

                               fuQu−1 ,uv = ρτ,u fQ,v .                        (17.3)

Proof: From the definition of dQ one readily verifies that duQu−1 (umu−1 ) =
dQ (m), for m ∈ M1Q . The result now follows by a straightforward application
of Proposition 17.1 (b). See [14], Lemma 3.6, for a similar proof.          
   Assume that Ω ⊂ ia∗P q is open, and f : Ω × X → Vτ a smooth map such
that fν : x 7→ f (ν, x) belongs to Atemp (X : τ ) for every ν ∈ Ω. If Q ∈ Pσ and
v ∈ NK (aq ), we shall write fQ,v for the map Ω × X1Q,v → Vτ defined by

               fQ,v (ν, m) = (fν )Q,v (m),       (ν ∈ Ω, m ∈ X1Q,v ).

We now turn our attention to the normalized Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P : · ) where
P ∈ Pσ is assumed to be of residue type. In the end it will follow that any
P ∈ Pσ is of this type, see Remark 12.2, so that this is really no restriction
on P. Let ΩP be the set of points in ia∗P q where the function ν 7→ E ◦ (P : ν) is
regular. Then for ν ∈ ΩP and ψ ∈ A2,P , the function E ◦ (P : ν : · )ψ belongs to
Atemp (X : τ ), see Proposition 13.15. In accordance with the above, we denote its
                                                                 ◦
constant term along (Q, v), for Q ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ), by EQ,v    (P : ν : · )ψ.

Proposition 17.4 (RT) Let P, Q ∈ Pσ and u ∈ NK (aq ).

 (a) The function EQ,u  (P : · ) extends to a meromorphic C ∞ (X1Q,u , Hom(A2,P , Vτ ))-
     valued function on a∗P qC , with singular set equal to a locally finite union of
     real Σr (P )-hyperplanes.
 (b) There exists a ε > 0 such that, for every ψ ∈ A2,P and p ∈ ΠΣr (P ) (a∗P q )
     with the property that ν 7→ p(ν)E ◦ (P : ν : · )ψ is regular on a∗P q (ε), the

      as an identity of meromorphic functions in the variable ν ∈ a∗QqC . Here
      s∗ ν = ν ◦ s, see § 3. The singular locus of any of the meromorphic func-

      tions EQ,u,s  (P : · ), for s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ), is the union of a locally finite
      collection of real Σr (P )-hyperplanes.

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2.
    (a): Let ψ ∈ A2,P , and define f : (ν, x) 7→ E ◦ (P : ν : x)ψ. Then f ∈
  hyp
EP,Y (X : τ ), with Y ⊂ ∗ a∗P q a finite subset, see Lemma 13.17. In particular,
                        ep,hyp
it follows that f ∈ CP,Y       (X+ : τ ), see Section 6. The set H: = Hf is a real
Σr (P )-configuration in a∗P qC , again by Lemma 13.17.
    Let H0 be the collection of H ∈ H with H ∩ ia∗P q 6= ∅. Then H0 is finite,
since H is real. For every H ∈ H0 we select a first degree polynomial function
                            −1
lH ∈ P1 (a∗P q ) with H = lH   (0), and put

with d = df . Select ε0 > 0 such that H ∈ H, H ∩ a∗P q (ε0 ) 6= ∅ ⇒ H ∈ H0 .
Then the family f 0 : (ν, x) 7→ π0 (ν)f (ν, x) belongs to O(a∗P q (ε0 ), C ∞ (X : τ )).

verges neatly in a. For every ν ∈ ΩP , the function fν0 belongs to Atemp (X : τ ),
see Proposition 13.15. Since Y is real, it follows by uniqueness of asymptotics,
for all m ∈ XQ,u,+ and a ∈ AQq , that

By density and continuity, this expression holds for all m ∈ XQ,u and a ∈ AQq .
On the other hand, by the characterization of the constant term in Proposition
17.1 (b), it follows that, for ν ∈ ΩP ,

                              (fν0 )Q,u = π0 (ν)(fν )Q,u .
                                                                           ◦
Using Lemma 13.17 once again, we infer from (17.5) that ν 7→ EQ,u            (P : ν)ψ =
(fν )Q,u extends to a meromorphic C (X1Q,u : τQ )-valued function on a∗P qC with
                                           ∞

singular set contained in ∪Hf . This establishes (a).
    We will first establish the remaining assertions under the assumption that
u = e.
    (b): Let Λ ∈ LP (b, τ ), ψ ∈ A2,P (Λ) and define f as above. For p ∈
ΠΣr (P ) (a∗P q ) we put fp (ν, x) = p(ν)f (ν, x).
    According to Theorem 15.12, there exist q ∈ ΠΣr (a∗P q ),R (a∗P q ) and constants
ε0 > 0 and s0 > 0, all independent of Λ and ψ, such that fq is holomorphic
on a∗P q (ε0 ) and belongs to T (P, τ, Λ, ε0 , s0 ). Let ε1 be any constant with 0 <
ε1 < ε0 . If p ∈ ΠΣr (P ) (a∗P q ) is such that fp is holomorphic on a∗P q (ε1 ), then
clearly fpq ∈ T (P, τ, Λ, ε0 , s0 ). By a repeated application of Cauchy’s integral
formula to fpq (ν, x), with polydiscs of size O((1 + lX (x))−1 ), it now follows that
fp ∈ T (P, τ, Λ, ε′1 , s0 ), for every ε′1 with 0 < ε′1 < ε1 . See [5], Lemma 6.1, for a
more detailed indication of how to use Cauchy’s formula.
    Let v ∈ P W be such that Λ ∈ LP,v (b, τ ), let b̂, t be as in Lemma 16.4 and
put P̂ = v −1 P v. Then, in view of Remark 16.5, the family fˆp : a∗P̂ qC × X → Vτ
defined by fˆp (µ, x) = fp (t−1 µ, x) belongs to T (P̂ , τ, tΛ, ε0 , s0 ).
    Since tΛ ∈ i∗ b̂∗ , by Lemma 16.4 (c), we may apply [17], Thm. 3, which in
turn is based on [5], Thm. 12.9. Let ε′1 < ε1 < ε0 be as above. According
to the mentioned theorem there exists a constant ε̄′1 > 0 such that for every

                                            80
F ∈ T (P̂ , τ, tΛ, ε′1 , s0 ), and all m ∈ X1Q,e , the function ν 7→ (Fν )Q,e is holomor-
phic on a∗P̂ q (ε̄′1 ). From the proof of [17], Thm. 3, it follows that this holds with
ε̄′1 = min(ε′1 , ε̄), where ε̄ > 0 is the constant of [17], Lemma 5. The latter con-
stant only depends on Λ; the set LP (b, τ ) is finite, hence we may chose ε̄ simulta-
neously for all Λ under consideration. We now fix ε > 0 such that ε < min(ε0 , ε̄).
Assume that the hypothesis of part (b) of the theorem is fulfilled. If we apply
the above discussion to the functions fp and F = fˆp , with ε1 = ε, then ε̄′1 = ε′1 ,
                                                                       ◦
and it follows that the function ν 7→ ((fp )ν )Q,e (m) = p(ν)EQ,e           (P : ν : m)ψ is
                        ∗    ′
holomorphic on aP q (ε1 ), for all m ∈ XQ,e . In view of part (a) of the theorem,
                                  ◦
it follows that ν 7→ p(ν)EQ,e        (P : ν)ψ is holomorphic on a∗P q (ε′1 ) as a function
with values in C (X1Q,e : τQ ). This holds for every ε′1 < ε, whence the desired
                       ∞

assertion.
     (c): From the hypothesis with v = e it follows that there exists a Λ ∈
                                                  ◦
LP (b, τ ) and a ψ ∈ A2,P (Λ) such that EQ,u         (P : ·)ψ 6= 0. Let Ω′P be the set of
ν ∈ ΩP such that Λ + ν is a Σ(b)-regular element of b∗C . It follows from Lemma
16.4 that Λ is regular with respect to Σ(mP C , ∗ bP ). Therefore, Ω′P is open dense
in ΩP , hence in ia∗P q . We infer that we may select ν ∈ Ω′P such that (fν )Q,e 6= 0,
with notation as introduced in part (a) of this proof.
     Fix v ∈ P W such that Λ ∈ LP,v (b, τ ). Let (b̂, t) be as in Lemma 16.4 and
put P̂ : = v −1 P v. Then tΛ belongs to i∗ b̂∗ and is regular relative to Σ(mP̂ C , ∗ b̂).
Now fν ∈ Atemp (X : τ ) and by Remark 16.5,
                              Dfν = γb̂ (D : tΛ + tν)fν ,                            (17.6)

for all D ∈ D(X). Since tΛ ∈ i∗ b̂∗ , tν ∈ iaP̂ q and tΛ + tν is regular with respect
to Σ(b̂), it follows from [17], Thm. 2, that the set W (aP̂ q | aQq ) is non-empty.
The map s 7→ t−1 ◦ s is a bijection from the latter set onto W (aP q | aQq ), which
set is therefore non-empty as well.
                                                 ◦
    (d): Uniqueness of the functions EQ,e,s            (P : · ) is obvious, by linear inde-

pendence of the functions a 7→ a           for generic ν. We fix Λ and ψ as in part (b)
of the proof and define f as in part (a). We define the set Ω′P as in (c). Let Ω′′P
be the open dense subset consisting of ν ∈ Ω′P with s∗ ν mutually different, for
s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ). Let v, b̂, t, P̂ be as in part (c) of the proof, and fix ν ∈ Ω′′P .
In view of (17.6), it follows from [17], Thm. 2, that there exists a collection of
functions ftν,ŝ,Q ∈ C ∞ (X1Q,e : τQ ), for ŝ ∈ W (aP̂ q | aQq ), such that
                                    X
              (fν )Q,e (m) =                  ftν,ŝ,Q (m),       (m ∈ X1Q,e );
                             ŝ∈W (aP̂ q |aQq )

and                            ∗
            ftν,ŝ,Q (ma) = aŝ    tν
                                        ftν,ŝ,Q (m),      (m ∈ X1Q,e , a ∈ AQq ).
Combining these equations, substituting ts for ŝ and writing fν,s,Q = ftν,ts,Q ,
we see that, for all m ∈ XQ,e and a ∈ AQq ,
                                      X         ∗
                    (fν )Q,e (ma) =          as ν fν,s,Q (m).            (17.7)

                                                  81
For every s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ) there exists an element s̃ ∈ W such that s = s̃|aQq ,
see Corollary 3.5. It follows that s∗ ν = s̃−1 ν|aQq , for all ν ∈ a∗P qC . Using
the definition of ∼Q|P we see that the class of s̃−1 in W/ ∼Q|P is uniquely
determined by s. We denote this class by σs . Comparing (17.5) and (17.7) we
see by uniqueness of asymptotics that X 7→ qσs ,0 (Q, e | f, X)(ν) is constant as
a C ∞ (XQ,e : τQ )-valued function on aQq and that

                         fν,s,Q (m) = qσs ,0 (Q, e | f, 0)(ν, m),
                                   ◦
for all m ∈ XQ,e . We define EQ,e,s    (P : ν : m)ψ: = qσs ,0 (Q, e | f, 0)(ν, m). Then
(17.4) applied to ψ follows for ν ∈ Ω′′P . Finally, the assertions on meromorphy
follow from the fact that qσs ,0 (Q, e | f, 0) ∈ M(a∗P qC , Hf , df , C ∞ (XQ,e : τQ )), by
Lemma 13.17.
    It remains to establish (b)-(d) under the assumption that u ∈ NK (aq ) is
arbitrary. Assertion (b) follows from the already established assertion with
u = e by application of Lemma 17.3 with u, e in place of u, v, respectively.
                                        ◦
    To prove (c), we assume that EQ,u       (P : · ) 6= 0 and put Q′ = u−1 Qu. Using
                                ◦
Lemma 17.3 we infer that EQ′ ,e (P : · ) 6= 0. Hence, from the already established
assertion (c) with Q′ , e in place of Q, u it follows that W (aP q | aQ′ q ) 6= ∅.
Since s 7→ Ad(u)−1 ◦ s ◦ Ad(u) induces a bijection from W (aP q | aQq ) onto
W (aP q | aQ′ q ), it follows that W (aP q | aQq ) 6= ∅.
    Finally, assertion (d) follows from the already established assertion with
u−1 Qu, e in place of Q, u by applying Lemma 17.3 once more in a similar fashion
as above.                                                                                 
   If P, Q are associated parabolic subgroups in Pσ , see Def. 13.4, then W (aP q |
aQq ) is a non-empty finite set of isomorphisms from aQq onto aP q ; moreover,
the natural left action of W (aP q ) as well as the natural right action of W (aQq )
on this set is free and transitive.

Proposition 17.5 (RT) Let P, Q ∈ Pσ be associated and let v ∈ NK (aq ).
   Then, for each s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ) and every ψ ∈ A2,P , the meromorphic
C ∞ (XQ,v : τ )-valued function ν 7→ EQ,v,s
                                          ◦
                                             (P : ν : · )ψ on a∗P qC , defined as in
(17.4), attains its values in the finite dimensional space A2 (XQ,v : τQ ).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P and Q are of residue
type, see Remark 12.2. Fix ψ ∈ A2,P . Let ν ∈ ΩP and define the function
f ∈ Atemp (X1Q,v : τQ ) by
                              ◦
                     f (m) = EQ,v (P : ν : m)ψ         (m ∈ XQ,v ).

We recall from Section 2 that ∗ aQq is maximal abelian in Ad(v)q. Let RQ be a
proper parabolic subgroup of MQ that contains ∗ AQq and is stable under the
involution σ v θ. In the notation of Section 2, RQ is of the form PX , for some
X ∈ ∗ aQq , relative to (MQ , θ) in place of (G, θ). Since X is fixed under σθ, it
follows that RQ is σθ-stable as well. The σ v -split component of the Lie algebra
of RQ equals aRQ ∩ Ad(v)q = aRQ ∩ ∗ aQq = aRQ ∩ q, hence equals the σ-split


                                            82
component. We therefore denote it by aRQ q ; the associated positive chamber is
denoted by a+ RQ q .
   Since AQ is central in M1Q , and stable under both σ v and σ, the group R1Q =
RQ AQ is a parabolic subgroup of M1Q that contains Aq and is stable under
both involutions σ v θ and σθ. The associated σ v -split component equals Aq =

  AQq AQq , which is also equal to the σ-split component of R1Q . Accordingly,
the positive chamber is given by A+          +
                                    R1Q q = ARQ q AQq .
   We now claim that every ξ ∈ Exp (R1Q , e | f ) satisfies
                          Re ξ + ρR1Q ≤ 0       on    a+

Indeed, for R1Q minimal this follows from Lemma 10.2. For general R1Q , it
follows by application of [14], Thm. 3.5.
    On the other hand, it is readily seen that R = R1Q NQ is an element of Pσ
and that R1Q = ∗1R: = R ∩ M1Q . By application of Lemma 17.2,

From RQ ( MQ we infer that R ( Q, hence aQq ( aRq , from which we see
that dim aRq > dim aP q ; hence, W (aP q | aRq ) = ∅. From Proposition 17.4 (b)
it now follows that the function on the right-hand side of the above equality is
zero. We conclude that fR1Q ,e = 0 for every RQ as above. By definition of the
constant term it follows that every ξ ∈ Exp (R1Q , e | f ) satisfies Re ξ + ρR1Q 6= 0

in addition to (17.8). Put fs = EQ,v,s (P : ν)ψ. Then

for m ∈ XQ,v and a ∈ AQq . It follows that every fs belongs to Atemp (XQ,v : τQ ).
Moreover, every ξ ∈ Exp (RQ , e | fs ) satisfies Re ξ + ρRQ ≤ 0 on a+        RQ q and
Re ξ + ρRQ 6= 0. In particular, if RQ is a maximal θσ v -stable parabolic subgroup
in MQ , it follows that every exponent ξ ∈ Exp (RQ , e | fs ) satisfies Re ξ + ρRQ <
0 on a+RQ q . This implies that (fs )RQ ,e = 0; hence, fs ∈ A2 (XQ,v : τQ ), by [9],
Prop. 12.

    Let s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ). We have shown that the function ϕ: ν 7→ EQ,v,s   (P : ν)ψ
attains its values in A2 (XQ,v : τQ ) for ν ∈ ΩP . Since Q is of residue type,
A2 (XQ,v : τQ ) is a finite dimensional subspace of C ∞ (XQ,v : τQ ) by Lemma 12.6.
By meromorphy it now follows that ϕ is A2 (XQ,v : τQ )-valued.                      
    If P, Q ∈ Pσ are associated, then s 7→ s−1 defines a bijection from W (aQq |

In the chain of reasoning leading up to Theorem 21.2, this definition requires
P to be of residue type, since it depends on the validity of Definition 13.7; see

is due to [5], Eqn. (133), in view of [9], Eqn. (52). For general P the result is
due to [19], Eqn. (5.3). See also Remark 13.10.

Remark 17.9 Note that it follows from the characterization of the normalized
Eisenstein integral in Proposition 13.6 that

18     The Maass–Selberg relations
In this section we derive the Maass–Selberg relations for the normalized C-
functions. As a first step we use the vanishing theorem to prove the following
functional equation for the Eisenstein integral.

Proposition 18.1 (RT) Let P, Q ∈ Pσ be associated parabolic subgroups.
Then, for each s ∈ W (aQq | aP q ) and all x ∈ X,

                    E ◦ (P : ν : x) = E ◦ (Q : sν : x) CQ|P

Remark 12.2. Fix ψ ∈ A2,P . By Corollary 17.7, the function ν 7→ CQ|P         (s: ν)ψ
                     ∗
belongs to M(aP qC , H, A2,Q ), for some locally finite collection H of Σr (P )-
hyperplanes in a∗P qC . It follows that the function λ 7→ CQ|P

      ∗
M(aQqC , sH, A2,Q ). Here sH is a locally finite collection of Σr (Q)-hyperplanes
in a∗QqC . By Proposition 13.6, the family (λ, x) 7→ E ◦ (Q : λ : x)ψQ belongs to
  hyp
EQ    (X : τ ), for every ψQ ∈ A2,Q . We conclude that the family

belongs to EQ     (X : τ ) as well. For λ in the complement Ω of a locally finite
union of hyperplanes in ia∗Qq , the function fλ belongs to Atemp (X : τ ), and its

                             X

see Corollary 17.7. Taking Remark 17.9 into account, we see that qλ−ρQ (Q, v |

fλ )(X, m) = [prv CQ|P (s : s−1 λ)ψ](m), for all λ ∈ Ω, X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ .
By application of [14], Thm. 7.7, Eqn. (7.14), it follows that

for generic λ ∈ ia∗Qq , X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ . By meromorphy this actually
holds as an identity of meromorphic functions in λ.
    On the other hand, it follows from Definition 13.7 combined with Lemma
6.12 that the family

union of hyperplanes in ia∗Qq , the function gλ belongs to Atemp (X : τ ), and its

This implies that, for every X ∈ aQq ,

the family f − g ∈ EQ    (X : τ ) satisfies the hypothesis of the vanishing theorem,
Theorem 6.11. Hence, f = g. It follows that the meromorphic C ∞ (X : τ )-valued
function ν 7→ fsν − gsν on a∗P qC is zero. This implies the result, in view of (18.1)

Remark 18.4 For the case of the group the above result was announced by
Harish-Chandra in [29], Thm. 6, with a proof appearing in [32], Lemma 17.1
(see also Remark 13.9). For the Riemannian case H = K, which is a special
case of that of the group, the relations were proved in [34], Thm. 6.6.
     For general reductive symmetric spaces and minimal P the result is due to
[5], Thm. 16.3, combined with [6], in view of [9], text after Eqn. (55). For general
P the result is due to J. Carmona and P. Delorme, [19], Thm. 2 and Prop. 5
(vi). See also Remark 13.10.

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P and Q are of residue

as a meromorphic identity in the variable ν ∈ a∗P qC . This holds for arbitrary
v, w ∈ Q W; in view of the direct sum decomposition (13.1) with Q in place of
P, the equality (18.10) therefore remains valid if the maps prQ,w and iQ,v are
replaced by the identity map of A2,Q .                                       

Remark 18.5 Conversely, if the Maass–Selberg relations (18.5) hold, then the
expression on the right-hand side of (18.7) equals the one on the right-hand side
of (18.6); hence (13.13), the invariance property of the kernel KP , follows. Thus,
the Maass–Selberg relations are equivalent to the invariance properties of the
kernel.

Corollary 18.6 (RT) Let P, Q ∈ Pσ be associated parabolic subgroups. and let

Hom(A2,P , A2,Q )-valued function CQ|P    (s : · ) is regular on a∗P q (ε).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P and Q are of residue
type, see Remark 12.2. The corollary is a straightforward consequence of Corol-
lary 17.7 and Theorem 18.3, combined with the lemma below.                   

Lemma 18.7 Let P ∈ Pσ . Let V be a complete locally convex space, and
let ϕ be a V -valued meromorphic function on a∗P qC , with singular locus sing ϕ
contained in a locally finite collection of real Σr (P )-hyperplanes. Assume that
for every λ0 ∈ ia∗P q there exists an open neighborhood ω of λ0 in ia∗P q such that
ϕ is bounded on ω \ sing ϕ. Then there exists a ε > 0 such that ϕ is holomorphic
on a∗P q (ε).




                                            87
Proof: Since the collection H of singular hyperplanes of ϕ is a real Σr (P )-
configuration, the number of H ∈ H with H ∩ a∗P q (ε′ ) ∩ H 6= ∅ is finite, for
every ε′ > 0. Hence, there exists a p ∈ ΠΣr (P ),R (a∗P q ) of minimal degree such
that ϕp : λ 7→ p(λ)ϕ(λ) is holomorphic on a neighborhood of ia∗P q . Clearly ϕp is
holomorphic on a∗P q (ε), for a suitable ε > 0. Assume that deg p ≥ 1. Then there
exists a α ∈ Σr (P ) and a constant c ∈ R such that l: λ 7→ hα , · i − c is a divisor
of p. By minimality of p it follows that h: = ia∗P q ∩ l−1 (0) is non-empty. From
the hypothesis we infer that ϕp = 0 on h. By analytic continuation it follows
that ϕp = 0 on hC ∩ a∗P q (ε) = l−1 (0) ∩ a∗P q (ε). By a straightforward argument
involving power series expansion in the coordinate function l, it now follows that
l−1 ϕp is holomorphic on a∗P q (ε). This contradicts the minimality of p. Hence,
deg p = 0 and the result follows.
                                                                                   

Theorem 18.8 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then there exists a constant ε > 0 such
that ν 7→ E ◦ (P : ν) is a holomorphic C ∞ (X, Hom(A2,P , Vτ ))-valued function on
a∗P q (ε).
Remark 18.9 For the group case the above result is due to Harish-Chandra
[32]. For general reductive symmetric spaces and for P minimal, the result is
due to [9], Thm. 2. For non-minimal P it is due to [19], Thm. 3(i).
Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Let Λ ∈ LP (b, τ ) and fix ψ ∈ A2,P (Λ) and η ∈ Vτ∗ . Let ε0 > 0;
then the family F : (λ, x) 7→ ηE ◦ (P : λ : x)ψ belongs to the space IImer (Λ, ε0 )
defined in [7], Def. 3. From Corollary 17.7 and Corollary 18.6 it follows that
F satisfies the hypotheses of [7], Thm. 2. Hence, there exists a ε1 > 0 such
that F belongs to the space II′ (Λ, ε1 ). In particular, this implies that λ 7→ Fλ
is holomorphic on a∗P q (ε) for some ε > 0. The theorem now follows by linearity
and finite dimensionality of Vτ and A2,P .                                       

Proposition 18.10 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then there exist constants ε > 0 and
s > 0 and for every u ∈ U (g) constants n ∈ N and C > 0, such that the func-
tion ν 7→ E ◦ (P : ν) is a holomorphic C ∞ (X, Hom(A2,P , Vτ ))-valued function on
a∗P q (ε) satisfying the estimate

   kE ◦ (P : ν : u; x)k ≤ C|(ν, x)|n Θ(x)es|Re ν|lX (x) ,     (ν ∈ a∗P q (ε), x ∈ X).
Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type,
see Remark 12.2. By finite dimensionality of Vτ and A2,P , it follows from
Theorem 15.12 and Definition 15.4 that there exists a p ∈ ΠΣr (P ),R (a∗P q ) and
constants ε > 0 and s > 0 such that ν 7→ p(ν)E ◦ (P : ν) is a holomorphic
function on a∗P q (ε), with values in C ∞ (X)⊗Hom(A2,P , Vτ ). Moreover, it satisfies
the following estimates. For every u ∈ U (g) there exist constants n ∈ N and
C > 0 such that
 kp(ν)E ◦ (P : ν : u; x)k ≤ C|(ν, x)|n Θ(x)es|Re ν|lX (x) ,     (ν ∈ a∗P q (ε), x ∈ X).
                                                                                  (18.11)

                                           88
If we choose ε > 0 sufficiently small, then by Theorem 18.8, the function ν 7→
E ◦ (P : ν) is already holomorphic on a∗P q (ε). By a straightforward application of
Cauchy’s integral formula, involving polydiscs of size O((1+lX (x))−1 ), it follows
that for ε > 0 sufficiently small, the following is true. For every u ∈ U (g) there
exist n ∈ N and C > 0 such that the estimate (18.11) holds with p = 1.            

Corollary 18.11 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then there exist constants ε > 0 and s > 0
and for every u ∈ U (g) constants n ∈ N and C > 0, such that the function ν 7→
E ∗ (P : ν) is a holomorphic C ∞ (X, Hom(Vτ , A2,P ))-valued function on a∗P q (ε)
satisfying the estimate

   kE ∗ (P : ν : u; x)k ≤ C|(ν, x)|n Θ(x)es|Re ν|lX (x) ,      (ν ∈ a∗P q (ε), x ∈ X).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. In view of Definition 13.7, the result follows from Proposition
18.10,                                                                     

Corollary 18.12 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then, for all U ∈ S(a∗P q ) and u ∈ U (g),
there exist constants m ∈ N and C > 0 such that

        kE ∗ (P : ν; U : u; x)k ≤ C|(ν, x)|m Θ(x),          (ν ∈ ia∗P q , x ∈ X).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. The result follows from the estimate of the previous corollary, by
a straightforward application of Cauchy’s integral formula involving polydiscs
of size O((1 + lX (x))−1 ).                                                   


19     The spherical Fourier transform
We recall from [5], Cor. 17.6, that there exists a constant N ∈ N such that

                                (1 + lX )−N Θ2 ∈ L1 (X).                            (19.1)

   Combining the estimate (12.1) with (19.1) and the estimate of Corollary
18.12, we see that the integral in the following definition converges absolutely.

Definition 19.1 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . If f ∈ C(X : τ ), we define its Fourier
transform FP f : ia∗P q → A2,P by
                            Z
               FP f (ν) =       E ∗ (P : ν : x) f (x) dx,     (ν ∈ ia∗P q ).
                            X

    The above definition depends on the validity of the estimate of Corollary
18.12. Thus, within the chain of reasoning leading up to Theorem 21.2, the use
of this definition requires P to be of residue type, see Remark 12.2.


                                            89
Remark 19.2 If G has compact center modulo H, then aGq = {0} and A2,G =
A2 (G/H : τ ). Moreover, using Remark 13.11 we infer that f 7→ FG f (0) is the
restriction to C(X : τ ) of the orthogonal projection L2 (X : τ ) → L2d (X : τ ) =
A2,G .

Lemma 19.3 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then for every U ∈ S(a∗P q ) there exists a
constant m ∈ N and a continuous seminorm s on C(X : τ ) such that

                      sup (1 + |ν|)−m kFP f (ν; U )k ≤ s(f ),
                     ν∈ia∗
                         Pq



for all f ∈ C(X : τ ). In particular, the Fourier transform FP maps C(X : τ )
continuous linearly into C ∞ (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P .

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. The result follows from the estimates (19.1) and (12.1) combined
with the estimate of Corollary 18.12.                                      

Lemma 19.4 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then for every D ∈ D(X) and all f ∈
C(X : τ ),
           FP (Df )(ν) = µP (D : ν)FP f (ν), (ν ∈ ia∗P q ). (19.2)

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see Re-
mark 12.2. From [3], Lemma 7.2, we recall that every D ∈ D(X) acts by a contin-
uous linear endomorphism on C(X : τ ). Since FP : C(X : τ ) → Cc∞ (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P
is continuous, it suffices to prove the identity (19.2) for f in the dense subspace
Cc∞ (X : τ ) of C(X : τ ). For such f the identity is an immediate consequence of
Lemma 14.8.                                                                      
   Let Ω be the image in D(X) of the Casimir operator defined by the bilinear
form B on g, see Section 2.

Lemma 19.5 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ and let ε > 0.

 (a) µP (Ω : ν) = −|ν|2 I + O(|ν|) as ν ∈ a∗P q (ε), |ν| → ∞.

 (b) There exists a constant R > 0 such that for every ν ∈ a∗P q (ε) with |ν| ≥ R
     the endomorphism µP (Ω : ν) is invertible and the operator norm of its
     inverse satisfies the estimate

                                |ν|2 kµP (Ω : ν)−1 k ≤ 2.                   (19.3)

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Let h · , · i denote the complex bilinear form on a∗P qC that extends
the dual of the given bilinear form on aP q . There exists a first order polynomial
function µ1 : a∗P qC → End(A2,P ) such that

                  µP (Ω : ν) = hν , νiI + µ1 (ν),    (ν ∈ a∗P qC ).         (19.4)


                                        90
Indeed, this follows by application of Corollary 14.4. It follows by a straightfor-
ward estimation that, for ν ∈ a∗P q (ε),

                   hν , νi = −|ν|2 + O(|ν|)    as     |ν| → ∞.               (19.5)

Using that kµ1 (ν)k = O(|ν|) we obtain (a) from (19.4) and (19.5). From (a) it
follows that −|ν|−2 µP (Ω : ν) = I + O(|ν|−1 ). Hence, (b) follows.         
     In the following result, S(ia∗P q ) denotes the Euclidean Schwartz space of
ia∗P q .

Proposition 19.6 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then the Fourier transform FP maps
C(X : τ ) continuous linearly into S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P .

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Moreover, we use the argumentation of [5], p. 436, completion of
the proof of Theorem 19.1, with FP in place of Fπ . Let us label the first two
displayed formulas in the mentioned text in [5] by (E1) and (E2), respectively.
The estimate (19.3) generalizes the estimate of [5], Lemma 19.4.
   Let R > 0 be as in Lemma 19.5 (b) for some choice of ε > 0 and let
u ∈ S(a∗P q ) and M ∈ N. In view of the last assertion of Lemma 19.3 it suffices to
prove the analogue of (E1), i.e., it suffices to prove the existence of a continuous
seminorm s on C(X : τ ) such that

                         kFP f (ν; u)k ≤ (1 + |ν|)−M s(f ),

for every f ∈ C(X : τ ) and all ν ∈ ia∗P q with |ν| ≥ R. As in [5] this is done by
induction on the order of u, by using Lemma 19.3 instead of (E2) and by using
Lemmas 19.4 and 19.5 instead of [5], Lemmas 19.3 and 19.4, respectively.         
   We end this section with a result on the Fourier transform of a compactly
supported smooth function. If S > 0 we write

                           XS : = {x ∈ X | lX (x) ≤ S}.

Then XS is a K-invariant compact subset of X. We write CS∞ (X : τ ) for the
closed subspace of C ∞ (X : τ ) consisting of functions with support contained in
XS .

Proposition 19.7 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ and let ε > 0 be as in Corollary 18.11.
For every f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ), the Fourier transform FP (f ) extends to a holomorphic
function on a∗P q (ε) with values in A2,P . Moreover, let S > 0. Then for every
m ∈ N there exists a continuous seminorm pm on CS∞ (X : τ ) such that, for every
f ∈ CS∞ (X : τ ),

                kFP f (ν)k ≤ (1 + |ν|)−m pm (f ),     (ν ∈ a∗P q (ε)).       (19.6)




                                        91
Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. The assertion about holomorphy is a straightforward consequence
of the holomorphy of the Eisenstein integral as formulated in Corollary 18.11.
Let n ∈ N be the constant of the mentioned corollary associated with u = 1. Let
S > 0. Then it straightforwardly follows from the estimate of Corollary 18.11
that there exists a continuous seminorm p0 on CS∞ (X : τ ) such that, for every
f ∈ CS∞ (X : τ ),

                 kFP f (ν)k ≤ (1 + |ν|)n p0 (f ),       (ν ∈ a∗P q (ε)).     (19.7)

Let R > 0 be associated with ε > 0 as in Lemma 19.5. Then it follows from the
above estimate that, for every k ∈ N and for ν ∈ a∗P q (ε) with |ν| ≥ R,

              |ν|2k kFP f (ν)k   =   |ν|2k kµP (Ω : ν)−k FP (Ωk f )(ν)k      (19.8)
                                              n     k    k
                                 ≤   (1 + |ν|) p0 (2 Ω f ).                  (19.9)

Taking k ∈ N such that n − 2k ≤ m we see that there exists a continuous
seminorm p′m on CS (X : τ ) such that for every f ∈ CS∞ (X : τ ) the estimate
(19.6) holds for all ν ∈ a∗P q (ε) with |ν| ≥ R. From (19.7) it follows that there
exists a constant C > 0 such that the estimate (19.6) holds with Cp0 in place
of pm , for all ν ∈ a∗P q (ε) with |ν| < R. Take for pm any continuous seminorm
with pm ≥ max(Cp0 , p′m ); then the desired assertion follows.                  
   We end this section with another useful result.

Lemma 19.8 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ and assume that aP q 6= 0. Then FP vanishes
on A2 (X : τ ).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Fix f ∈ A2 (X : τ ). Then there exists a non-trivial polynomial
q in one variable such that q(Ω)f = 0. In view of Lemma 19.4 it follows that
q(µP (Ω : ν))FP f (ν) = 0 for all ν ∈ ia∗P q . From Lemma 19.5 it follows that the
polynomial function ν 7→ det q(µP (Ω : ν)) is not identically zero. Hence, FP f
vanishes on an open dense subset of ia∗P q . By smoothness of FP f it follows that
FP f = 0.                                                                       


20     The wave packet transform
It follows from the estimate in Proposition 18.10 that the integral in the following
definition is absolutely convergent. We agree to write dν for the Lebesgue
measure dµP (ν) on ia∗P q , normalized as in Section 5.

Definition 20.1 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then for every ϕ ∈ S(ia∗P qC ) ⊗ A2,P , we
define the wave packet JP ϕ: X → Vτ by
                         Z
              JP ϕ(x): =       E ◦ (P : ν : x) ϕ(ν) dν (x ∈ X).
                            ia∗
                              Pq




                                         92
    This definition depends on the validity of the estimate of Proposition 18.10,
which in the chain of reasoning leading up to Theorem 21.2 requires P to be of
residue type, see Remark 12.2.
    Note that the wave packet JP ϕ is smooth τ -spherical function.

Remark 20.2 If G has compact center modulo H, then AGq = {0} and A2,G =
A2 (G/H : τ ). In this case the measure dν = dµG has total volume 1 (end of
Section 5), and using Remark 13.11 we infer that JG ϕ = ϕ(0). Accordingly, JG
is naturally identified with the inclusion map A2 (X : τ ) → C ∞ (X : τ ).

Theorem 20.3 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ Then the wave packet map JP maps S(ia∗P q )⊗
A2,P continuous linearly into the Schwartz space C(X : τ ).

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. Let Λ ∈ LP (b, τ ) and fix ψ ∈ A2,P (Λ). We recall from the proof
of Theorem 18.8 that the family F defined by

                              F (ν, x) = E ◦ (P : ν : x)ψ

has components with respect to a basis of Vτ that are functions of type II′ (Λ)
in the sense of [7]. Hence, by [7], Thm. 1, the map α 7→ Wα,F , where
                                     Z
                        Wα,F (x) =        α(ν)F (ν, x) dν,
                                        ia∗
                                          Pq


is continuous linear from S(ia∗P q ) into C(X : τ ). We note that Wα,F = JP (α⊗ψ).
Hence, the result follows by using linearity, the finite dimensionality of A2,P (see
Corollary 14.4) and the decomposition (14.10) of the latter space.                
   Let P ∈ Pσ and D ∈ D(X). In the following lemma we write µP (D) for the
endomorphism of S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P given by

                          [µP (D)ϕ](ν) = µP (D : ν)(ϕ(ν)),

for ϕ ∈ S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P and ν ∈ ia∗P q .

Lemma 20.4 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ and D ∈ D(X). Then

                D ◦ JP = JP ◦ µP (D)              on   S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P .   (20.1)

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type,
see Remark 12.2. The operator D defines a continuous linear endomorphism of
C(X : τ ), by [3], Lemma 7.2. In view of Theorem 20.3 it follows that both sides
of the equation are continuous linear maps from S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P to C(X : τ ).
Hence, by density it suffices to prove the equality when applied to an element
ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P . But then the result is an immediate consequence of
Lemma 14.1 by differentiation under the integral sign, in view of Definition
20.1.                                                                         


                                             93
    We equip C(X : τ ) with the restriction of the L2 -inner product h · | · i from
L (X : τ ). Similarly, for P ∈ Pσ , we equip S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P with the restriction of
 2

the L2 -type inner product h · | · i from L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P . With respect to these
structures the Fourier transform FP and the wave packet map JP are adjoint
in the following sense.

Lemma 20.5 (RT) Let P ∈ Pσ . Then the continuous linear operators FP : C(X : τ ) →
S(ia∗P q )⊗ A2,P and JP : S(ia∗P q )⊗ A2,P → C(X : τ ) are adjoint in the sense that,
for all f ∈ C(X : τ ) and ϕ ∈ S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P ,

                               hFP f | ϕi = hf | JP ϕi                          (20.2)

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that P is of residue type,
see Remark 12.2. By continuity and density it suffices to prove (20.2) for all
f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) and ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P . For such f and ϕ, the formula follows
by an application of Fubini’s theorem.                                             


21      Fourier inversion for Schwartz functions
In this section we show that the Fourier inversion formula (8.10), established in
[12], implies an inversion formula for Schwartz functions, formulated in terms
of the Fourier transforms and the wave packet maps introduced in the previous
sections.
    The crucial first step is the following.

Proposition 21.1 (RT) Let F ⊂ ∆. Then for every W -invariant even residue
weight t ∈ WT(Σ),

                  TFt = [W : WF ] t(a+
                                     F q ) JF FF   on    Cc∞ (X : τ ).          (21.1)

Proof: We give the proof under the assumption that PF is of residue type, see
Remark 12.2. In case F = ∆ and G has compact center modulo H, then aF q =
aGq = {0} and the proof below has to be read according to the conventions
indicated in Remarks 8.8, 9.4, 13.11, 19.2 and 20.2.
   Let f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) and x ∈ X+ . It follows from (8.8) that
                                 Z       Z
        TFt f (x) = |W | t(a+
                            Fq )             KFt (ν : x : y)f (y) dy dµF (ν),
                                  ia∗
                                    F q +εF    X


for all εF ∈ a+ F q sufficiently close to zero. In view of (13.12) and Definition 19.1,
this equality may be rewritten as
                                    Z
     TFt f (x) = [W : WF ] t(a+Fq )           E ◦ (PF : ν : x)FF f (ν) dµF (ν).  (21.2)
                                  ia∗
                                    F q +εF


Since the expressions on both sides of the equation extend smoothly to all of X
in the variable x, it follows that (21.2) holds for all x ∈ X. From Theorem 18.8

                                              94
and Proposition 19.7 it follows that ν 7→ E ◦ (PF : ν : x)FF f (ν) is holomorphic
on a∗F q (ε), for some ε > 0. Moreover, from the mentioned results it also follows
that for every N > 0, there exists a constant CN > 0 such that

          kE ◦ (PF : ν : x)FF f (ν)k ≤ CN (1 + |ν|)−N ,     (ν ∈ a∗F q (ε)).

This estimate allows us to take the limit of (21.2) for εF → 0; thus, using
Definition 20.1 and observing that dµF (ν) = dν on ia∗F q , we obtain (21.1). 
   The proof of the following result involves an induction step using the long
chain of results marked (RT), see Remark 12.2.

Theorem 21.2
 (a) Every P ∈ Pσ is of residue type.
 (b) If t is any W -invariant even residue weight for Σ, then
                               X
                          f=       [W : WF ] t(a+
                                                F q )JF FF f,                  (21.3)
                                 F ⊂∆

      for every f ∈ C(X : τ ).
 (c) The pair (G, H) is of residue type if and only if G has a compact center
     modulo H.

Proof: We first show that (c) and (b) follow from (a). Thus, assume (a). Then
viewed as a parabolic subgroup, G is of residue type. By Remark 13.3 it follows
that the pair (◦ G, ◦ G ∩ H) is of residue type. Moreover, if G has compact center
modulo H, then (G, H) is of residue type. If the center of G is not compact
modulo H, then (G, H) is not of residue type, by Definition 12.1 (a). This
establishes (c).
    We now turn to (b). Let f be a W -invariant even residue weight for Σ. Then
for each F ⊂ ∆, the parabolic subgroup PF is of residue type so that Proposi-
tion 21.1 applies. It now follows from (8.10) combined with (21.1) that (21.3)
holds for every f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ). Finally, the validity of (b) follows by density of
Cc∞ (X : τ ) and continuity of each of the JF FF , for F ⊂ ∆ (Proposition 19.6
and Theorem 20.3 apply with P = PF , since PF is of residue type).
    It remains to prove (a). We will do this by induction on dim Aq , the σ-
split rank of G. First, assume that dim Aq = 0. Then X is compact, hence the
pair (G, H) is of residue type, see Remark 12.3. It follows that G, viewed as a
parabolic subgroup, is of residue type, see Remark 13.3. Since Pσ = {G}, this
establishes (a) in case dim Aq = 0.
    Thus, assume that dim Aq ≥ 1 and that (a) has been established for all pairs
(G′ , σ ′ ) with G′ of σ-split rank smaller than dim Aq .
    If the center of G is not compact modulo H, then ◦ Aq : = ◦ G ∩ Aq ( Aq .
Hence, it follows by the inductive hypothesis that every σ-parabolic subgroup of
◦
  G containing ◦ Aq is of residue type. Denote the set of these parabolic subgroups
by ◦ Pσ . Then G = ◦ G × C, where C = exp(center (g) ∩ p) and P 7→ P C is a

                                        95
bijection from ◦ Pσ onto Pσ . Moreover, MP C = MP for every P ∈ Pσ (◦ G). In
view of Definition 13.1 it follows that every parabolic subgroup from Pσ is of
residue type as well, whence (a).
    Thus, we may assume that G has compact center modulo H; then a∆q = 0.
By the inductive hypothesis, the symmetric pairs (MF , MF ∩vHv −1 ), for F ( ∆
and v ∈ NK (aq ), satisfy condition (a). In particular, MF , viewed as a parabolic
subgroup of MF , is of residue type relative to vHv −1 . Since ◦ MF = MF , it
follows by Remark 13.3 that the pairs (MF , MF ∩ vHv −1 ), are all of residue
type. In view of Definition 13.1 it now follows that the standard parabolic
subgroups PF , for F ( ∆, are all of residue type.
                                                                 t
    Let t be a W -invariant even residue weight on Σ. Then T∆       is a continuous
                          ∞
linear operator from Cc (X : τ ) into the finite dimensional subspace At∆ (X : τ )
of C ∞ (X : τ ); all functions in this subspace are D(X)-finite, see the text after
(9.1).
    Proposition 21.1 applies for every subset F ( ∆. Hence, from (8.10) and
(21.1) it follows that
                                   X
                        T∆t

                                      F (∆

as an operator from Cc∞ (X : τ ) into C ∞ (X : τ ). Applying Proposition 19.6 and
                                  t
Theorem 20.3 we infer that T∆       extends to a continuous linear map from C(X : τ )
        t
into A∆ (X : τ ) ∩ C(X : τ ); moreover, the latter intersection is continuously con-
tained in A2 (X : τ ). By density of Cc∞ (X : τ ), the validity of the identity (21.4)
extends to the space C(X : τ ).
     By repeated application of Lemma 19.8, with P = PF , F ( ∆, it follows from
                t
(21.4) that T∆    = I on A2 (X : τ ). Finally, by application of Lemma 20.5 to (21.4)
                   t
it follows that T∆   is symmetric with respect to the L2 -inner product on C(X : τ ).
                        t
We conclude that T∆       is the orthogonal projection from C(X : τ ) onto A2 (X : τ );
in particular, it follows that the latter space is finite dimensional. Moreover,
since A2 (X : τ ) is dense in L2d (X : τ ) it follows that A2 (X : τ ) = L2d (X : τ ) and
         t
that T∆    is the restriction of the orthogonal projection L2 (X : τ ) → L2d (X : τ ).
From this we conclude that (G, H) is of residue type, see Definition 12.1 and
Remark 12.5. Hence, P∆ = G is of residue type. It follows that all standard
parabolic subgroups in Pσ are of residue type. Since every P ∈ Pσ is associated
with a standard one, see Lemma 3.6, assertion (a) follows by application of
Lemma 13.5.                                                                             
   We define the equivalence relation ∼ on the collection of subsets of ∆ by
F ∼ F ′ ⇐⇒ PF ∼ PF ′ .

Lemma 21.3 Let t be a W -invariant even residue weight on Σ and let F ⊂ ∆.
Then                  X
                                                    −1

                             F ′ ∼F




                                             96
Proof: Let Pσ (AF q ) denote the collection of all P ∈ Pσ with σ-split component
AP q equal to AF q . Moreover, let S denote the collection of all subsets F ′ ⊂ ∆
with F ′ ∼ F. For every P ∈ Pσ (AF q ) there exists a unique FP ⊂ ∆ such that
sP s−1 = PFP , for some s ∈ W, see Lemma 3.6. Clearly, FP ∼ F. Moreover, the
map p: P 7→ FP is surjective from Pσ (AF q ) onto S. If F ′ ∈ S, let WF ′ ,F denote
the collection of s ∈ W mapping aF q onto aF ′ q . Then the map s 7→ s−1 PF ′ s
from WF ′ ,F onto p−1 (F ′ ) factors to a bijection from W (aF ′ q | aF q ) onto p−1 (F ′ ).
Starting from (2.1) with Q = PF we now obtain that
                                 X
                   1 =                   t(a+
                                            P q)
                             P ∈Pσ (AF q )
                                  X                  X
                        =                                           t(s−1 (a+
                                                                            F ′ q ))
                                 F ′ ⊂∆       s∈W (aF ′ q |aF q )
                                 F ′ ∼F
                                  X
                        =                 |W (aF ′ q | aF q )| t(a+
                                                                  F ′ q ).
                                 F ′ ⊂∆
                                 F ′ ∼F


For every F ′ ⊂ ∆ with F ′ ∼ F, the group W (aF q ) acts freely and transitively
from the right on W (aF ′ q | aF q ). Hence, |W (aF ′ q | aF q )| = |W (aF q )| and the
result follows.                                                                      

Lemma 21.4 Let P, Q ∈ Pσ be associated parabolic subgroups and let s ∈
W (aP q | aQq ). Then
 (a) FP f (sν) = CP◦ |Q (s : ν)FQ f (ν), for all f ∈ C(X : τ ) and ν ∈ ia∗Qq ;

 (b) JP FP = JQ FQ as endomorphisms of C(X : τ ).

Proof: It follows from Corollary 18.2 combined with the Maass–Selberg rela-
tions (18.5), that

                      E ∗ (P : sν : x) = CP◦ |Q (s : ν)E ∗ (Q : ν : x),

for all x ∈ X and all ν ∈ ia∗Qq . Now (a) follows by Definition 19.1. The linear
bijection s from ia∗Qq onto ia∗P q maps the chosen Lebesgue measures onto each
other, see Section 5. Hence, for f ∈ C(X : τ ),
                                 Z
                 JP FP f (x) =        E ◦ (P : sν : x)FP f (sν) dν.       (21.5)
                                     ia∗
                                       Qq


Applying (a) and Proposition 18.1 we obtain that

          E ◦ (P : sν : x)FP f (sν) =            E ◦ (P : sν : x)CP◦ |Q (s : ν)FQ f (ν)
                                          =      E ◦ (Q : ν : x)FQ f (ν).

Substituting the obtained identity in the right-hand side of (21.5) we obtain (b).

Remark 21.5 Let P ∈ Pσ . Then it follows from part (b) of the above lemma
that the continuous linear endomorphism JP ◦ FP of C(X : τ ) depends on P
through its equivalence class in Pσ /∼ .
   If P ∈ Pσ , we agree to write WP∗ for the normalizer of aP q in W. Then
W (aP q ) ≃ WP∗ /WP .
Theorem 21.6 Let f ∈ C(X : τ ). Then
                           X
                   f=            [W : WP∗ ] JP FP f.

Remark 21.7 In view of Remark 13.10, this theorem corresponds to part (iii)
of Thm. 2 in Delorme’s paper [24]. Note that in the latter theorem constants
|W (aP q )|−1 , for P ∈ Pσ , appear in place of the constants [W : WP∗ ]. This is due
to a different normalization of measures, as will be explained in the sequel [15]
to this paper.
Proof: We observe that [W : WP ]|W (aP q )|−1 = [W : WP∗ ], for P ∈ Pσ . Since
every P ∈ Pσ is associated with a standard parabolic subgroup, see Lemma 3.6,
the result now follows from Theorem 21.2, Lemma 21.3 and Remark 21.5. 


22      Properties of the Fourier transforms
The purpose of this section is to establish relations between the different Fourier
and wave packet transforms FP and JQ , as P, Q ∈ Pσ . We shall also determine
the image of FP and the kernel of JQ . The relation between the several Fourier
transforms is given by Lemma 21.4 (a).
Lemma 22.1 Let P, Q, R ∈ Pσ be associated. Then, for all s ∈ W (aQq |aP q )
and t ∈ W (aRq |aQq ),
             ◦               ◦               ◦
            CR|P (ts : ν) = CR|Q (t : sν) ◦ CQ|P (s : ν),         (ν ∈ ia∗P q ).
Proof: The above identity is an immediate consequence of the functional equa-
tion for the Eisenstein integral, see Proposition 18.1, and the definition of the
C-function, see Definition 17.6.                                               
   In particular, from the above lemma with P = Q = R combined with the
Maass–Selberg relations, see Theorem 18.3, we see that we may define a unitary
representation γP of W (aP q ) in L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P by

             [γP (s)ϕ](ν) = CP◦ |P (s : s−1 ν)ϕ(s−1 ν),          (ν ∈ ia∗P q ),

for ϕ ∈ L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P . The associated collection of W (aP q )-invariants in
L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P is denoted by (L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q ) . The orthogonal pro-
jection from the first onto the latter space is denoted by
            PW (aP q ) : L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P → (L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q ) .

                                              98
The intersection of the latter space with S(ia∗P q )⊗A2,P consists of the functions
ϕ ∈ S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P satisfying
             ϕ(sν) = CP◦ |P (s : ν)ϕ(ν),        (s ∈ W (aP q ), ν ∈ ia∗P q ),   (22.1)

and is denoted by (S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q ) .
Corollary 22.2 Let P ∈ Pσ . The image of C(X : τ ) under the Fourier trans-
form FP is contained in the space (S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q ) .
Proof: Let f ∈ C(X : τ ). Then it follows from Lemma 21.4(a) with P = Q that
ϕ: = FP f satisfies (22.1).                                               
   We can now state the first main result of this section.
Theorem 22.3 Let P, Q ∈ Pσ .
 (a) If P and Q are not associated, then FQ ◦ JP = 0.
 (b) If P and Q are associated, then [W : WP∗ ] FQ ◦ JP ◦ FP = FQ on C(X : τ ).
  (c) If P and Q are associated, then, for each s ∈ W (aQq | aP q ), every ϕ ∈
      S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P and all ν ∈ ia∗P q ,

                 FQ ◦ JP ϕ (sν) = [W : WP∗ ]−1 CQ|P
                                                ◦
                                                    (s : ν)PW (aP q ) ϕ(ν).

      In particular, FP ◦ JP = [W : WP∗ ]−1 PW (aP q ) .
   The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 16.6 in [10], with adaptations
to deal with the present more general situation. In the course of the proof we
need two lemmas. The first of these is a straightforward generalization of Lemma
16.11 in [10].
Lemma 22.4 Let P ∈ Pσ , let b ⊂ q be a θ-stable Cartan subspace containing
aP q and let Λ ∈ ∗ b∗P C . Then for λ in the complement of a finite union of affine
hyperplanes in a∗P qC , the map D 7→ d[γ(D : Λ + · )](λ) is surjective from D(X)
onto aP qC .
Proof: The proof is a straightforward modification of the proof of Lemma
16.12 in [10]. In that proof one should everywhere put aP q in place of aq and
∗
  bP in place of bk . In particular, πaq should be replaced by the projection
πaP q : b∗C → a∗P qC along the subspace ∗ b∗P C .                            
   The next lemma is a consequence of Lemma 16.4, which in turn heavily relies
on the information about the infinitesimal characters of discrete series stated in
Theorem 16.1.
Lemma 22.5 Let P, Q ∈ Pσ , let b ⊂ q be a θ-stable Cartan subspace containing
aq and let Λ1 ∈ LP (b, τ ) and Λ2 ∈ LQ (b, τ ). Let ν1 ∈ ia∗P q be such that Λ1 +ν1 is
regular with respect to Σ(b), let ν2 ∈ ia∗Qq and assume that Λ1 + ν1 and Λ2 + ν2
are conjugate under W (b). Then P and Q are associated, and ν1 and ν2 are
conjugate under W (aQq | aP q ).

                                           99
Proof: Let s ∈ W (b) be such that s(Λ1 + ν1 ) = Λ2 + ν2 . Select v1 ∈ P W
and v2 ∈ Q W such that Λ1 ∈ LP, v1 (b, τ ) and Λ2 ∈ LQ, v2 (b, τ ). Let (b̂1 , t1 )
and (b̂2 , t2 ) be associated with P, v1 and Q, v2 , respectively, as in Lemma 16.4.
Then t1 Λ1 + t1 ν1 and t2 Λ2 + t2 ν2 are conjugate under t2 st−1   1   ∈ W (b̂2 | b̂1 ).
It follows by application of [17], Lemma 2, that t1 aP q = Ad(v1 )−1 aP q and
t2 aQq = Ad(v2 )−1 aQq are conjugate under t2 st−1    1 . This implies that s(aP q ) =
aQq . It follows that s|aP q ∈ W (aQq | aP q ), see Lemma 3.7; hence, P ∼ Q. It also
follows by [17], Lemma 2, that t2 st−1 1 maps t1 ν1 onto t2 ν2 ; hence, sν1 = ν2 . 

   The following lemma collects some properties of the composition FQ ◦ JP
needed in the proof of Theorem 22.3.

Lemma 22.6 Let P, Q ∈ Pσ . Then the composition T : = FQ ◦ JP is a contin-
uous linear map from S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P to S(ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q . Moreover, it satisfies
the following properties.
 (a) µQ (D) ◦ T = T ◦ µP (D) for all D ∈ D(X).

 (b) T maps into (S(ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q )W (aQq ) .

Proof: The continuity of T follows from Theorem 20.3 combined with Propo-
sition 19.6. Property (a) follows from Lemma 20.4 combined with Lemma 19.4.
Finally, (b) follows from Corollary 22.2.                                

Proposition 22.7 Let P, Q ∈ Pσ . There exists an open dense W (aQq )-invariant
subset Ω ⊂ ia∗Qq with the following property. Let T be any continuous linear
map from S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P to S(ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q satisfying the properties of Lemma
22.6.
 (a) If P and Q are not associated, then T = 0.
 (b) If P and Q are associated and s0 ∈ W (aP q | aQq ), then there exists a
     unique smooth function β: Ω → Hom(A2,P , A2,Q ) such that

                               T ϕ(ν) = PW (aQq ) (β s∗0 ϕ)(ν),                  (22.2)

      for all ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (s0 Ω) ⊗ A2,P and ν ∈ Ω.

Proof: For every ν ∈ ia∗Qq , we define the distribution uν ∈ D′ (ia∗P q ) ⊗
Hom(A2,P , A2,Q ) by

                 uν (ϕ) = T (ϕ)(ν),        (ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P ).

Then it follows from condition (a) that

                   uν ◦ µP (D) = µQ (D : ν)uν ,        (D ∈ D(X)).




                                          100
Let now Λ1 ∈ LP (b, τ ) and ψ1 ∈ A2,P (Λ1 ). Let Λ2 ∈ LQ (b, τ ) and ψ2 ∈
A2,Q (Λ2 ). We define the distribution vν ∈ D′ (ia∗P q ) by vν (f ) = huν (f ⊗ψ1 ) | ψ2 i,
for f ∈ Cc∞ (ia∗P q ). It follows that

                      [γb (D : Λ1 + · ) − γb (D : Λ2 + ν)]vν = 0.                  (22.3)

Each element Λ from the finite set LQ (b, τ ) is regular with respect to Σ(mQC , ∗ bQ ),
see Corollary 16.6. Let Ω0 be the set of ν ∈ ia∗Qq such that Λ + ν is regular with
respect to Σ(b), for every Λ ∈ LQ (b, τ ). Then Ω0 is the complement of a finite
union of hyperplanes in ia∗Qq , hence open dense.
    Let ν ∈ Ω0 and let Λ1 , Λ2 be as above. Moreover, let ν1 ∈ ia∗P q and assume
that ν ∈
       / W (aQq | aP q )ν1 . Then by Lemma 22.5, the elements Λ1 + ν1 and Λ2 + ν
are not conjugate under W (b). Hence, there exists a D ∈ D(X) such that the
polynomial function in front of vν in (22.3) does not vanish at ν1 . This implies
that vν vanishes in a neighborhood of ν1 . Let ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P . Then it
follows from the above by linearity that T (ϕ)(ν) = uν (ϕ) = 0 for all ν ∈ Ω0
with ν ∈/ W (aQq | aP q )supp ϕ. By density and continuity, this implies that the
function T (ϕ) vanishes on ia∗Qq \ W (aQq | aP q )supp ϕ. Hence,

                          supp T ϕ ⊂ W (aQq | aP q )supp ϕ.

If P and Q are not associated, then it follows that the latter set has empty
interior in ia∗Qq , hence T ϕ = 0 by continuity. This establishes (a).
    From now on, we assume that P ∼ Q. Then it follows from the above that

                              supp uν ⊂ W (aP q | aQq )ν,                          (22.4)

for every ν ∈ ia∗Qq .
    Let Ω1 be the set of ν ∈ ia∗Qq whose stabilizer in W (aQq ) is trivial. Then Ω1
contains the complement of a finite union of hyperplanes in ia∗Qq hence is open
dense in ia∗Qq . Since W (aQq ) acts simply transitively on W (aP q | aQq ) from the
right, we see that if ν ∈ Ω1 , the points sν, for s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ), are mutually
different.
    Let Ω′2 be the set of µ ∈ ia∗P q such that for every Λ1 ∈ LP (b, τ ) the map
D 7→ d[γb (D : Λ1 + · )](µ) is surjective from D(X) onto a∗P qC . Then Ω′2 is an open
subset of ia∗P q containing the complement of a finite union of hyperplanes, see
Lemma 22.4. It follows that Ω2 = ∩s∈W (aP q |aQq ) s−1 Ω′2 is a similar subset of
ia∗Qq . We define Ω: = Ω1 ∩ Ω2 .
    Let now ν ∈ Ω. We claim that the distribution uν has order zero. To prove
the claim, fix Λ1 , Λ2 , ψ1 , ψ2 as before, and define v = vν as above. Then by
linearity, it suffices to show that v has order zero. Since supp (v) ⊂ W (aP q |
aQq )ν, by (22.4), it follows by our assumption on Ω1 that we may express v
uniquely as a sum of distributions vs , for s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ), with supp vs ⊂ {sν}.
From (22.3) it follows that each vs satisfies the equations

                             ϕD vs = 0,       (D ∈ D(X)),

where ϕD : ia∗P q → C is given by ϕD = γb (D : Λ1 + · ) − γb (D : Λ + ν).

                                           101
   It follows from our assumption on Ω2 that the collection of differentials
dϕD (sν), for D ∈ D(X), spans a∗P qC . Now apply [10], Lemma 16.10, to conclude
that vs has order zero, for each s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ). This establishes the claim
that vν has order zero.
   It also follows from the above that
                                   X
                         uν =               δsν ⊗ Es (ν),
                                 s∈W (aP q |aQq )

with Es (ν) a unique element of Hom(A2,P , A2,Q ), for s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ). We
conclude that, for every ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P and all ν ∈ Ω,
                                      X
                       T ϕ(ν) =                Es (ν)ϕ(sν).             (22.5)
                                   s∈W (aP q |aQq )

Fix s0 ∈ W (aP q | aQq ). Let ν0 ∈ Ω. By the assumption on Ω1 there exists an
open neighborhood U of ν0 in Ω such that the sets sU are mutually disjoint, for
s ∈ W (aP q | aQq ). For ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (s0 U ) ⊗ A2,P we have

                              T (ϕ)(ν) = Es0 (ν)ϕ(s0 ν).

We conclude that Es0 is smooth on U. It follows that Es0 ∈ C ∞ (Ω)⊗Hom(A2,P , A2,Q ).
From the above asserted uniqueness of the Es and the transformation property
of T ϕ stated in Lemma 22.6 (b), it follows that
                             ◦
                 Es0 (tν) = CQ|Q (t : ν)Es0 t (ν),    (t ∈ W (aQq )).

If we combine this with (22.5) we obtain, for all ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (s0 Ω) ⊗ A2,P , and all
ν ∈ Ω, that
            X
                   ◦
T ϕ(ν) =          CQ|Q (t : ν)−1 Es0 (tν)ϕ(s0 tν) = |W (aQq )| PW (aQq ) (Es0 s∗0 ϕ)(ν).
          t∈W (aQq )

This establishes the result with β = |W (aQq )|Es0 .                                

Proof of Theorem 22.3: If P 6∼ Q, then it follows from Lemma 22.6 combined
with Proposition 22.7 that FQ ◦ JP = 0.
   To prove (b)Pwe note that if f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ), then it follows from Theorem
21.6 that f = [R]∈Pσ /∼ [W : WR∗ ] JR FR f. Applying FQ to both sides of this
equation, it follows by (a) that

                            FQ f = [W : WR∗ ] FQ JR FR f

for each R ∈ Pσ with R ∼ Q; in particular, we may take R = P. Thus, (b)
follows by continuity and density.
    We shall first prove (c) under the assumption that P = Q and s = 1. Put
T = FP ◦ JP . From Lemma 22.6 and Proposition 22.7 we deduce that

                             T ψ(ν) = PW (aP q ) (βψ)(ν),

                                           102
for all ψ ∈ Cc∞ (Ω) ⊗ A2,P and ν ∈ Ω; here Ω ⊂ ia∗P q is an open dense subset,
and β ∈ C ∞ (Ω) ⊗ End(A2,P ). It follows from Lemma 20.5 that the operator
T is symmetric with respect to the L2 -inner product on S(iaP q ) ⊗ A2,P . Let
ϕ ∈ S(iaP q ) ⊗ A2,P . Then for all ψ ∈ Cc∞ (Ω) ⊗ A2,P ,

         hT ϕ | ψi = hϕ | T ψi = hϕ | PW (aP q ) (βψ)i = hβ ∗ PW (aP q ) ϕ | ψi.

This implies that, for all ϕ ∈ S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P , T ϕ = β ∗ PW (aP q ) ϕ on Ω. We
claim that in fact β ∗ = [W : WP∗ ]−1 I on Ω.
    To prove the claim we note that it follows from the established part (b) with
P = Q that FP = [W : WP∗ ] T FP . We infer that, for f ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ) and ν ∈ Ω,

                  FP f (ν) =       [W : WP∗ ] T FP f (ν)
                              =    [W : WP∗ ] β(ν)∗ PW (aP q ) FP f (ν)
                              =    [W : WP∗ ] β(ν)∗ FP f (ν).

In the last equality we have used Corollary 22.2. The claim now follows by
application of Lemma 22.8 below. We infer that for all ϕ ∈ S(iaP q ) ⊗ A2,P ,
we have T ϕ = [W : WP∗ ]−1 PW (aP q ) ϕ on Ω, hence on ia∗P q , by continuity and
density. This establishes part (c) of the theorem for P = Q and s = 1. For a
general pair of associated parabolic subgroups P, Q and a general s ∈ W (aP q |
aQq ) the assertion follows by application of Lemma 21.4 (a).                   

Lemma 22.8 Let P ∈ Pσ and let ν ∈ ia∗P q have trivial stabilizer in W (aP q ).
Then f 7→ FP f (ν) maps Cc∞ (X : τ ) onto A2,P .

Proof: The proof is a reduction to the lemma below, in a way completely
analogous to the proof of [10], Lemma 16.13.                         

Lemma 22.9 Let P ∈ Pσ and let ν ∈ ia∗P q have trivial stabilizer in W (aP q ).
Then for every ψ ∈ A2,P \ {0}, the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P : ν)ψ does not
vanish identically on X.

Proof: The proof is completely analogous to the proof of [10], Lemma 16.14,
involving the constant term of the Eisenstein integral along P.          

Proposition 22.10 Let P ∈ Pσ .
 (a) The map PW (aP q ) restricts to a continuous linear projection from S(ia∗P q )⊗
     A2,P onto (S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q ) . This projection is orthogonal with re-
     spect to the given L2 -inner product.
 (b) JP ◦ PW (aP q ) = JP .
 (c) The kernel of JP equals the kernel of PW (aP q ) .



                                          103
Proof: It follows from Theorem 22.3 (c) that PW (aP q ) = [W : WP∗ ] FP ◦ JP .
It now follows from application of Lemma 22.6, that PW (aP q ) is a continuous
linear endomorphism of S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P , with image contained in (S(ia∗P q ) ⊗
A2,P )W (aP q ) . The latter space is contained in (L2 (ia∗P q )⊗A2,P )W (aP q ) , on which
space PW (aP q ) equals the identity. Hence, PW (aP q ) is a projection and (a) readily
follows.
    Starting from Theorem 22.3 (b) with P = Q, we obtain by taking adjoints
and applying Lemma 20.5, that

                            JP ◦ [W : WP∗ ]FP ◦ JP = JP .

Assertion (b) now follows by application of Theorem 22.3 (c).
   From (b) it follows that ker PW (aP q ) ⊂ ker JP . The converse inclusion follows
by Theorem 22.3 (c).                                                              

Proposition 22.11 Let P ∈ Pσ . Then the image of FP equals (S(ia∗P q ) ⊗
A2,P )W (aP q ) .

Proof: That im (FP ) ⊂ (S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q ) was asserted in Corollary 22.2.
For the converse inclusion, let ϕ ∈ (S(ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q ) . Then

                  ϕ = PW (aP q ) ϕ = FP ([W : WP∗ ] JP ϕ) ∈ im (FP ),

in view of Theorem 22.3 (c).                                                            


23      The spherical Plancherel theorem
In this final section we establish the Plancherel theorem for functions from
C(X : τ ) and L2 (X : τ ). If P ∈ Pσ , then by CP (X : τ ) we denote the image of the
operator JP in C(X : τ ).

Theorem 23.1         Let P ∈ Pσ .
 (a) The space CP (X : τ ) is closed in C(X : τ ) and depends on P ∈ Pσ through
     its class in Pσ /∼ .
 (b) The spaces ker FP and CP (X : τ ) are each other’s orthocomplement in
     C(X : τ ).
  (c) The space C(X : τ ) admits the following finite direct sum decomposition
                                          M
                            C(X : τ ) =          CR (X : τ ).             (23.1)
                                           [R]∈Pσ /∼


      The summands are mutually orthogonal with respect to the L2 -inner prod-
      uct on C(X : τ ).


                                           104
 (d) For each P ∈ Pσ , the operator [W : WP∗ ] JP ◦ FP is the projection onto
     CP (X : τ ) along the remaining summands in the above direct sum.

Remark 23.2 For the case of the group this result, together with Propositions
22.10 and 22.11, is a consequence of Harish-Chandra’s Plancherel theorem for
K-finite Schwartz functions, see Remark 13.9 and [32], §27. See also [1], Ch. III,
§1, for a review of the Plancherel theorem for spherical Schwartz functions.
    For general symmetric spaces, the result, together with Propositions 22.10
and 22.11, is equivalent to Thm. 2 in Delorme’s paper [24], in view of Remark
13.10. See also Remark 21.7.

Proof: If Q ∈ Pσ , Q 6∼ P, then, by Theorem 22.3 (a),

                           FQ = 0       on     CP (X : τ ).                   (23.2)

In view of Theorem 21.6 this implies that

                    [W : WP∗ ] JP FP = I      on      CP (X : τ ).            (23.3)

We infer that CP (X : τ ) = im (JP FP ). By Remark 21.5 it follows that CP (X : τ )
depends on P through its class in Pσ /∼ . This establishes the second assertion
of (a). From Theorem 21.6 we see that C(X : τ ) is the vector sum of the spaces
CR (X : τ ), for [R] ∈ Pσ /∼ . To establish the orthogonality of the summands,
let P, Q ∈ Pσ , P 6∼ Q, let f ∈ CP (X : τ ) and ψ ∈ S(ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q . Then
hf | JQ ψi = hFQ f | ψi = 0, by Lemma 20.5 and (23.2). This establishes (c).
Combining (c) with (23.2) and (23.3), we obtain (d). From (c) it follows that
CP (X : τ ) is closed, whence (a).
    It remains to establish (b). From (23.2) it follows that ker FP contains the
part C0 of the sum (23.1) consisting of the summands with R 6∼ P. On the other
hand, ker FP ∩ CP (X : τ ) = 0 by (23.3) and we conclude that ker FP = C0 . The
latter space equals the orthocomplement of CP (X : τ ), by the orthogonality of
the sum (23.1).                                                                 
   We denote by L2P (X : τ ) the closure in L2 (X : τ ) of CP (X : τ ). This space
depends on P through its class in Pσ /∼ .

Corollary 23.3 The space L2 (X : τ ) admits the following orthogonal direct
sum decomposition into closed subspaces
                                     M
                      L2 (X : τ ) =      L2P (X : τ ).
                                      [P ]∈Pσ /∼


Proof: Since C(X : τ ) is dense in L2 (X : τ ), the result is an immediate conse-
quence of Theorem 23.1 (c).                                                    
    We recall that a continuous linear map between Hilbert spaces T : H1 → H2 is
called a partial isometry if T is an isometry from (ker T )⊥ into H2 . In particular,
this means that im T is a closed subspace of H2 .


                                        105
Theorem 23.4        Let P ∈ Pσ .
 (a) The operator FP extends uniquely to a continuous linear map from L2 (X : τ )
     to L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P , denoted FP .

 (b) The operator JP extends uniquely to a continuous linear map from L2 (ia∗P q )⊗
     A2,P to L2 (X : τ ), denoted JP . This extension is the adjoint of the ex-
     tended operator FP .
 (c) The extended operator [W : WP∗ ]1/2 FP is a partial isometry from L2 (X : τ )
     onto the space (L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q ) , with kernel equal to the ortho-
     complement of L2P (X : τ ).
 (d) The extended operator [W : WP∗ ]1/2 JP is a partial isometry from L2 (ia∗P q )⊗
     A2,P onto L2P (X : τ ) with kernel equal to the orthocomplement of (L2 (ia∗P q )⊗
     A2,P )W (aP q ) .
 (e) Let Pσ ⊂ Pσ be a choice of representatives for the classes in Pσ /∼ . Then
                        X
                   I=        [W : WR∗ ] JR FR on L2 (X : τ ).
                            R∈Pσ


Remark 23.5 In view of Remark 13.10, this result corresponds to part (iv) of
Theorem 2 in [24]. See also Remark 23.2.

Proof: Fix Pσ as in (e). Let f ∈ C(X : τ ). Then it follows from Theorem 23.1
(c) and (d), combined with Lemma 20.5 that
                         X                             X
      kf k2 = hf | f i =   [W : WR∗ ] hf | JR FR f i =   [W : WR∗ ] kFR f k2 .
                        R∈Pσ                             R∈Pσ

In particular, this equation holds for a choice of Pσ with P ∈ Pσ . It fol-
lows that FP is continuous with respect to the L2 -topologies. By density of
C(X : τ ) in L2 (X : τ ), it follows that FP has a unique continuous linear exten-
sion L2 (X : τ ) → L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P . Hence (a).
    Since JP is the adjoint of FP with respect to the L2 -inner products on the
Schwartz spaces, it follows that the adjoint of the extension of FP is a continuous
linear extension of JP to a continuous linear operator from L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P to
L2 (X : τ ). This extension is unique by density of S(ia∗P q ) in L2 (ia∗P q ). This
proves (b).
    By continuity and density, the formula in (e) follows from Theorem 21.6.
From Theorem 23.1 (b) and (c) it follows that, for R ∈ Pσ with R 6∼ P,
FP = 0 on CR (X : τ ), hence on L2R (X : , τ ), by continuity and density. Put FeP : =
[W : WP∗ ]1/2 FP and JeP : = [W : WP∗ ]1/2 JP . Using (e) we infer that ker FeP =
L2P (X : τ )⊥ and that JeP ◦ FeP is the orthogonal projection from L2 (X : τ ) onto
L2P (X : τ ). Since JeP = FeP∗ , it follows that FeP is isometric from L2P (X : τ ) onto
im FeP and that JeP is isometric from im FeP onto L2P (X : τ ). It follows from

                                          106
Theorem 22.3 and continuity and density that FeP ◦ JeP = PW (aP q ) on L2 (ia∗P q )⊗
A2,P . Hence,

      im (FeP ) = FeP (L2P (X : τ )) = im (PW (aP q ) ) = (L2 (ia∗P q ) ⊗ A2,P )W (aP q )

and (c) follows. Finally, (d) follows from (c) by taking adjoints.                          
