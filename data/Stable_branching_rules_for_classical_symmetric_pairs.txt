                                                                              1. Introduction
                                               Given completely reducible representations, V and W of complex algebraic
                                            groups G and H respectively, together with an embedding H ֒→ G, we let [V, W ] =
                                            dim HomH (W, V ) where V is regarded as a representation of H by restriction. If
                                            W is irreducible, then [V, W ] is the multiplicity of W in V . This number may of
                                            course be infinite if V or W is infinite dimensional. A description of the numbers
                                            [V, W ] is referred in the mathematics and physics literature as a branching rule.
                                               The context of this paper has its origins in the work of D. Littlewood. In [Li2],
                                            Littlewood describes two classical branching rules from a combinatorial perspective
                                            (see also [Li1]). Specifically, Littlewood’s results are branching multiplicities for
                                            GLn to On and GL2n to Sp2n . These pairs of groups are significant in that they
                                            are examples of symmetric pairs. A symmetric pair is a pair of groups (H, G) such
                                            that G is a reductive algebraic group and H is the fixed point set of a regular
                                            involution defined on G. It follows that H is a closed, reductive algebraic subgroup
                                            of G.
                                               The goal of this paper is to put the formula into the context of the first named
                                            author’s theory of dual reductive pairs. The advantage of this point of view is
                                            that it relates branching from one symmetric pair to another and as a consequence
                                            Littlewood’s formula may be generalized to all classical symmetric pairs.
                                               Littlewood’s result provides an expression for the branching multiplicities in
                                            terms of the classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficients (to be defined later) when
                                            the highest weight of the representation of the general linear group lies in a certain
                                            stable range.
                                               The point of this paper is to show how when the problem of determining branch-
                                            ing multiplicities is put in the context of dual pairs, a Littlewood-like formula results
                                            for any classical symmetric pair. To be precise, we consider 10 families of symmet-
                                            ric pairs which we group into subsets determined by the embedding of H in G (see
                                            Table I in §3).

                                            1.1. Parametrization of Representations. Let G be a classical reductive alge-
                                            braic group over C: G = GLn (C) = GLn , the general linear group; or G = On (C) =
                                            On , the orthogonal group; or G = Sp2n (C) = Sp2n , the symplectic group. We shall
                                            explain our notations on irreducible representations of G using integer partitions.
                                                                                       1

In each of these cases, we select a Borel subalgebra of the classical Lie algebra as is
done in [GW]. Consequently, all highest weights are parameterized in the standard
way (see [GW]).
    A non-negative integer partition λ, with k parts, is an integer sequence λ1 ≥
λ2 ≥ . . . ≥ λk > 0. Sometimes we may refer to partitions as Young or Ferrers
diagrams. We use the same notation for partitions as is done in [Ma]. For example,
we write ℓ(λ) to denote   P the length (or depth) of a partition, |λ| for the size of a
partition (i.e., |λ| = i λi ). Also, λ′ denotes the transpose (or conjugate) of λ
(i.e., (λ′ )i = |{λj : λj ≥ i}|). A partition where all parts are even is called an even
partition, and we shall denote an even partition 2δ1 ≥ 2δ2 ≥ . . . ≥ 2δk simply by
2δ.

GLn Representations: Given non-negative integers p and q such that n ≥ p + q
and non-negative integer partitions λ+ and λ− with p and q parts respectively, let
  (λ+ ,λ− )
F(n)        denote the irreducible rational representation of GLn with highest weight
given by the n-tuple:
                                                                                       
               (λ+ , λ− ) = λ+        +            +                   −             −
                                 1 , λ2 , · · · , λp , 0, · · · , 0, −λq , · · · , −λ1
                              |                            {z                          }
                                                            n
                                         +            (λ+ ,λ− )
If λ− = (0) then we will write F(n)  λ
                                       for F(n)                   . Note that if λ+ = (0) then
 − ∗                     +   −
   λ                     (λ  ,λ  )
  F(n) is equivalent to F(n)       .

On Representations: The complex (or real) orthogonal group has two connected
components. Because the group is disconnected we cannot index irreducible repre-
sentation by highest weights. There is however an analog of Schur-Weyl duality for
the case of On in which each irreducible rational representation is indexed uniquely
by a non-negative integer partition ν such that (ν ′ )1 + (ν ′ )2 ≤ n. That is, the sum
of the first two columns of the Young diagram of ν is at most n. (See [GW] Chapter
                       ν
10 for details.) Let E(n) denote the irreducible representation of On indexed by ν
in this way.
   The irreducible rational representations of SOn may be indexed by their highest
weight, since the group is a connected reductive linear algebraic group. In [GW]
Section 5.2.2, the irreducible representations of On are determined in terms of
their restrictions to SOn (which is a normal subgroup having index 2). See [GW]
Section 10.2.4 and 10.2.5 for the correspondence between this parametrization and
the above parametrization by partitions.

Sp2n Representations: For a non-negative integer partition ν with p parts where
             ν
p ≤ n, let V(2n) denote the irreducible rational representation of Sp2n where the
highest weight indexed by the partition ν is given by the n tuple:
                               (ν1 , ν2 , · · · , νp , 0, · · · , 0)
                               |                {z                 } .
                                                 n
1.2. Littlewood-Richardson Coefficients. Fix a positive integer n0 . Let λ, µ
and ν denote non-negative integer partitions with at most n0 parts. For any n ≥ n0
we have:           h                   i h                        i
                     µ       ν     λ         µ       ν       λ
                    F(n) ⊗ F(n) , F(n)  = F(n  0)
                                                  ⊗ F(n0)
                                                          , F(n0)

And so we define:                    h                   i
                                       µ

                                           ⊗ F(n)    λ
                                                  , F(n)
for some (indeed any) n ≥ n0 .
   The numbers cλµ ν are known as the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and are
extensively studied in the algebraic combinatorics literature. Many treatments
defined from wildly different points of view. See [BKW], [CGR], [Fu], [GW], [JK],
[Kn1], [Ma], [Sa], [St3] and [Su] for examples.
1.3. Stability and the Littlewood Restriction Rules. We now state the Lit-
tlewood restriction rules.

                                               2δ
where the sum is over all non-negative integer partitions with even columns (2δ)′ .
   Notice that the hypothesis of the above two theorems do not include an arbitrary
parameter for the representation of the general linear group. The parameters which
fall within this range are said to be in the stable range. These hypothesis are
necessary but for certain µ it is possible to weaken them considerably see [EW1]
and [EW2].
   One purpose of this paper is to make the first steps toward a uniform stable
range valid for all symmetric pairs. In the situation presented here we approach
the stable range on a case-by-case basis. Within the stable range, one can express
the branching multiplicity in terms of the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. These
kinds of branching rules will later be combined with the rich combinatorics literature
on the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients to provide more algebraic structure to
branching rules.

                         2. Statement of the results.
   We now state our main theorem. As it addresses 10 families of symmetric pairs,
which state in 10 parts. The parts are grouped into 4 subsets named: Diagonal,
Direct Sum, Polarization and Bilinear Form. These names describe the embedding
of H into G (see Table I of §3).

2.5. Remarks: Although a thorough survey is beyond our present goals, we wish to
record here many previous works on branching rules which in many cases overlaps
with ours. We are grateful to the referee who has given us an extensive list of
references with comments on related works by experts. We shall briefly summarize
related works as follows:
    (a) Diagonal: The first rule 2.1.1 appears as (4.6) with (4.15) in King’s paper
        [Ki2]. The branching rules 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 for orthogonal and symplectic
        groups goes back to Newell [Ne] and Littlewood [Li3]. A more rigorous
        account of the Diagonal rules also appears in [Ki4], along with a treatment
        of rational representations of GLn . See Theorem 4.5 and Theorem 4.1 of
        [Ki4] and the references therein. Our methods are also cast in this same
        generality. Further, 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 are beautifully presented in Sundaram’s
        survey [Su] with references to the proofs in [BKW].
    (b) Direct Sum: Rule 2.2.1 appears as (5.8) with (4.16) in one of the earlier
        works of King [Ki1], which derives from a conjecture in the Ph.D. thesis by
        Abramsky [Ab]. These branching rules are also addressed in [Ko] and [KT].
        Specifically, 2.2.1 can be found in Proposition 2.6 of [Ko], and 2.2.2 and
        2.2.3 can be found in Theorem 2.5 and Corollary 2.6 of [KT]. An account
        of the Direct Sum rules also appears in [Ki4] (see (2.1.6) and the references
        therein).
    (c) Polarization: The polarization branching rules, 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 are stated
        as (4.21) and (4.22), respectively, in [Ki3], and also as Theorem A1 of [KT].
    (d) Bilinear Form: The Littlewood restriction rule is a special case of for-
        mulas, 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 (see [Li1] and [Li2]). These two formulas can be
        viewed as a generalization of Littlewood’s restriction rule. Besides the Di-
        agonal branching formulas, [Su] also presents a thorough treatment of the
        classical Littlewood restriction rules. However, in the most general form,
        the rules 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 appear as (5.7) with (4.19), and (5.8) with (4.23)
        respectively in [Ki2].

   Most of the results have been sufficiently well known by experts. For a well
presented survey of the representation theory of the classical groups from a com-
binatorial point of view we refer the reader to [Su]. And the late Wybourne and
his students have even incorporated these results in the software package SCHUR
downloadable at http://smc.vnet.net/Schur.html. This package implements all the
modification rules given in [Ki2] and [BKW] that allow the stable branching rules
to be generalized so as to cover all possible non-stable cases as well.
   From our point of view, it is striking that the theory of dual pairs leads to proofs
of all 10 of these formulas in such a unified manner. We feel that this unifying theme
should be brought out in the literature more systematically than it has been.
   In [Su] Theorem 5.4, it is shown how the Littlewood Richardson rule for branch-
ing from GL2n to Sp2n may be modified to obtain a version of the Littlewood
restriction rule which is valid outside the stable range. Removing the stability
condition for Littlewood’s restriction rules is a delicate problem, which was also
addressed in [EW1] and [EW2]. Classically, Newell [Ne] presents modification rules
to the Littlewood restriction rules to solve the branching problem outside of the
stable range (see [Su] and [Ki2]). For some recent remarks on the literature of
branching rules we refer the reader to [Ki3], [Kn2], [Kn3], [Kn4] and [Pr]. The
discussions in [Kn2] are relevant to our approach. Some of the results in [Kn2] are
important special cases of the results in [GK].
   While we only require decompositions of tensor products of infinite-
dimensional holomorphic discrete series as in [Re], we also wish to note the nu-
merous works in more generality which can be found in [RWB], [KW], [TTW], [OZ]
and [KTW], amongst the many others. It is interesting to note that the papers
[RWB], [KW], [TTW] and [KTW] have exploited the duality correspondence (see
§3.1) to relate the multiplicities of tensor products of infinite-dimensional represen-
tations to multiplicities of tensor products of finite-dimensional representations in
the same spirit of [Ho1].

                        3. Dual Pairs and Reciprocity
  The formulation of classical invariant theory in terms of dual pairs [Ho2] allows
one to realize branching properties for classical symmetric pairs by considering
concrete realizations of representations on algebras of polynomials on vector spaces.

3.1. Dual Pairs and Duality Correspondence. Let W ≃ R2m be a
2m-dimensional real vector space with symplectic form < ·, · >. Let Sp(W ) =
Sp2m (R) denote the isometry group of the form < ·, · >. A pair of subgroups
(G, G′ ) of Sp2m (R) is called a reductive dual pair (in Sp2m (R)) if
    (a) G is the centralizer of G′ in Sp2m (R) and vice versa, and
    (b) both G and G′ act reductively on W .
   The fundamental group of Sp2m (R) is the fundamental group of Um , its maximal
compact subgroup, and is isomorphic to Z. Let Sp f 2m (R) denote a choice of a double
                                                                            em denote
cover of Sp2m (R). We will refer to this as the metaplectic group. Also let U

This is a unitary representation and one realization is on the space of holomorphic
functions on Cm , commonly referred to as the Fock space. In this realization, the

                                                      em · v in P(Cm ) is finite dimensional.
   Choose z1 , z2 , . . . , zm as a system of coordinates on Cm . The Lie algebra action
of sp2m (the complexified Lie algebra of Sp2m (R)) on P(Cm ) can be described by
the following operators:

   Let us restrict our dual pairs to the following:
                                                                            ∗
                  (On (R), Sp2k (R)),         (Un , Up,q ),        (Sp(n), O2k ).                (3.4)
Observe that the first member is compact, and these pairs are usually loosely re-
ferred to as compact pairs.
   To avoid technicalities involving covering groups, instead of the real groups
(G0 , G′0 ), we shall discuss in the context of pairs (G, g′ ) where G is a complexi-
fication of G0 and g′ is a complexification of the Lie algebra of G′0 . The use of
the phrase “up to a central character” in the statements (a) to (c) below basically
suppresses the technicalities involving covering groups. Each of these pairs can be
conveniently realized as follows:
    (a) (On (R), Sp2k (R)) ⊂ Sp2nk (R):
        Let Cn ⊗ Ck be the space of n by k complex matrices. The complexified
                                                            enk -finite functions. The
        pair (On , sp2k ) acts on P(Cn ⊗ Ck ) which are the U
        group On acts by left multiplication on P(Cn ⊗ Ck ) and can be identified
        with the holomorphic extension of the On (R) action on the Fock space.
        The action of the subalgebra glk of sp2k is (up to a central character) the
        derived action coming from the natural right action of multiplication by
        GLk .

    (b) (Un , Up,q ) ⊂ Sp2n(p+q) (R):
                                           en(p+q) -finite functions with the polyno-
        For this pair, we may identify the U
        mial ring P(Cn ⊗ Cp ⊕ (Cn )∗ ⊗ Cq ). The complexified pair is (GLn , glp,q ).
        There is a natural action of GLn and GLp × GLq on this polynomial ring
        as follows:
                      (g, h1 , h2 ) · F (X, Y ) = F (g −1 Xh1 , g t Y h2 ),
8                    ROGER HOWE, ENG-CHYE TAN, JEB F. WILLENBRING


         where X ∈ Cn ⊗ Cp , Y ∈ (Cn )∗ ⊗ Cq , g ∈ GLn , h1 ∈ GLp and h2 ∈ GLq .
         Obviously both left and right actions commute. Here glp,q ≃ glp+q , but
         we choose to differentiate the two because of the role of the subalgebra
         glp ⊕ glq , which acts by (up to a central character) the derived action of
         GLp × GLq on the polynomial ring.
                   ∗
    (c) (Sp(n), O2k  ) ⊂ Sp4nk (R):
        In this case, P(C2n ⊗ Ck ) are the U e2nk -finite functions, with natural left
        and right actions by Sp2n and GLk respectively. The complexified pair
        is (Sp2n , o2k ), where the subalgebra glk of o2k acts by (up to a central
        character) the derived right action of GLk .
   With the realizations of these compact pairs (G, g′ ) ⊂ Sp2m (R), let us look at
the representations that appear. Form

  Observe that G0 is Hermitian symmetric in all three cases, and the decomposition
above is an instance of the complexified Cartan decomposition

where g′     ≃ ω(k′ ), g′   ≃ ω(p′ ) and g′   ≃ ω(p′ ). In particular, k′ has a

one-dimensional center and p are the ±i eigenspaces of this center. Each p′ is
an abelian Lie algebra. Note, in particular,

                                                   ′
   A representation (ρ, Vρ ) of g is holomorphic if there is a non-zero vector v0 ∈ Vρ
              −
killed by ρ(p′ ). The following are the key properties of holomorphic representa-
tions:
     (a) There is a non-trivial subspace
                                            −                                                                           −
             (Vρ )0 = ker ρ(p′ ) = {v ∈ Vρ | ρ(Y ) · v = 0 for all Y ∈ p′ }
        which is k′ irreducible. This is known as the lowest k′ -type of ρ.
    (b) Vρ is generated by (Vρ )0 , more precisely,
                                                               +                     +
                                          Vρ = U(p′ ) · V0 = S(p′ ) · V0 .
                                                                              +
         The second equality results because p′ is abelian.
  Now one of the key features in the formalism of dual pairs is the branching
decomposition of the oscillator representation. The branching property for compact
pairs alluded to is (see [Ho2] and the references therein):
                                             M
                            P(Cm ) |G×g′ =        τ ⊗ Vτ ′                    (3.8)
                                                                          b
                                                                     τ ∈S⊂G

where S is a subset of the set of irreducible representations of G, denoted by G.  b
                                                                            ′
The representations Vτ ′ (written to emphasize the correspondence τ ↔ τ and the
dependence on τ ∈ G)  b are irreducible holomorphic representations of g′ . They
are known to be derived modules of irreducible unitary representations of some
appropriate cover of G′0 ([Ho3]). The key feature of this branching is the uniqueness

of the correspondence, i.e., a representation of G appearing uniquely determines the
representation of the g′ module that appears and vice-versa. We refer to this as
the duality correspondence.
   This duality is subjugated to another correspondence in the space of harmonics.

H is a G × K ′ module and it admits a multiplicity-free G × K ′ (hence G × k′ )
decomposition:

   The structure of Vτ ′ is even nicer in certain category of pairs, which we will refer
to as the stable range. The stable range refers to the following:
    (a) (On (R), Sp2k (R)) for n ≥ 2k;
    (b) (Un , Up,q ) for n ≥ p + q;
                    ∗
    (c) (Sp(n), O2k   ) for n ≥ k.
In the stable range, the holomorphic representations of g′ that occur have k′ -
structure which are nicer ([HC], [Sc1], [Sc2]), namely,
                                           (2,0)                     (0,2)
                             Vτ ′ = S(g′           ) ⊗ ker τ ′ (g′           ).
They are known as holomorphic discrete series or limits of holomorphic discrete
series (in some limiting cases of the parameters determining τ ′ ) of the appropriate
covering group of G′0 . It is these representations that will feature prominently in
this paper.
   Let us conclude by describing the duality correspondence for the compact dual
pairs in the stable range. Parts of the following well known result can be found in
several places, see [EHW], [HC], [Ho2], [Ho3], [Sc1], [Sc2] for example.

would like to understand the branching of irreducible representations from G to H,
for symmetric pairs (H, G). Table I lists the symmetric pairs which we will cover
in this paper.

  If G is a classical group over C, then G can be embedded as one member of a dual
pair in the symplectic group as described in [Ho2]. The resulting pairs of groups

are (GLn , GLm ) or (On , Sp2m ), each inside Sp2nm , and are called irreducible dual
pairs. In general, a dual pair of reductive groups in Sp2r is a product of such pairs.

Proposition 3.1. Let G be a classical group, or a product of two copies of a
classical group. Let G belong to a dual pair (G, G′ ) in a symplectic group Sp2m .
Let H ⊂ G be a symmetric subgroup, and let H ′ be the centralizer of H in Sp2m .
Then (H, H ′ ) is also a dual pair in Sp2m , and G′ is a symmetric subgroup inside
H ′.

Proof: This can be shown by fairly easy case-by-case checking. These are shown
in Table II. We call these pair of pairs reciprocity pairs. These are special cases of
see-saw pairs [Ku].      

   Consider the dual pairs (G, G′ ) and (H, H ′ ) in Sp2m . We illustrate them in the
see-saw manner as follows:
                                  G      −       G′
                                     ∪                 ∩
                                H       −      H′
Recall the duality correspondence for G × g′ and H × h′ on the space P(Cm ):

               P(Cm ) |G×g′ =         σ ⊗ Vσ′ =      P(Cm )σ⊗σ′ ,

                                                           τ ∈T ⊂H
                             m                    m
where we have written P(C )σ⊗σ′ and P(C )τ ⊗τ ′ as the σ ⊗σ ′ -isotypic component
and τ ⊗ τ ′ -isotypic component in P(Cm ) respectively. Given σ and τ ′ , we can seek
the σ ⊗ τ ′ -isotypic component in P(Cm ) in two ways as follows:
                   P(Cm )σ⊗τ ′ ≃ (σ |H )τ ⊗ Vσ′ ≃ τ ⊗ (Wτ ′ |h′ )σ′ .                      (3.15)
In other words, we have the equality of multiplicities (as pointed out in [Ho1]):
                                    [σ, τ ] = [Wτ ′ , Vσ′ ]                                (3.16)
that is, the multiplicity of τ in σ |H is equal to the multiplicity of Vσ′ in Wτ ′ |h′ .
This is good enough for our purposes in this paper. However, this equality of
12               ROGER HOWE, ENG-CHYE TAN, JEB F. WILLENBRING


multiplicities is just a feature of some deeper phenomenon – an isomorphism of
certain branching algebras which captures the respective branching properties.
3.3. Branching Algebras. One approach to branching problems exploits the fact
that the representations have a natural product structure, embodied by the algebra
of regular functions on the flag manifold of the group. For a reductive complex
algebraic G, let NG be a maximal unipotent subgroup of G. The group NG is
determined up to conjugacy in G. Let AG denote a maximal torus which normalizes
NG , so that BG = AG ·NG is a Borel subgroup of G. Let A  b+ be the set of dominant
                                                           G
characters of AG – the semigroup of highest weights of irreducible representations
of G. It is well-known (see for instance, [Ho4]) that the space of regular functions
on the coset space G/NG decomposes (under the action of G by left translations)
as a direct sum of one copy of each irreducible representation Vψ , of highest weight
ψ, of G:                                     M
                               R(G/NG ) ≃         Vψ .
                                               b+
                                             ψ∈A G

   We note that R(G/NG ) has the structure of an A       b+ -graded algebra, for which
                                                           G
the Vψ are the graded components. Let H ⊂ G be a reductive subgroup and AH =
AG ∩ H be a maximal torus of H normalizing NH , a maximal unipotent subgroup
of H, so that BH = AH · NH is a Borel subgroup of H. We consider the algebra
R(G/NG )NH , of functions on G/NG which are invariant under left translations
by NH . This is an (A     b+ × A  b+ )-graded algebra. Knowledge of R(G/NG )NH as
                           G       H
    b +    b +
a (AG × AH )-graded algebra tell us how representations of G decompose when
restricted to H, in other words, it describes the branching rule from G to H. We
will call R(G/NG )NH the (G, H) branching algebra. When G ≃ H × H, and H
is embedded diagonally in G, the branching algebra describes the decomposition
of tensor products of representations of H, and we then call it the tensor product
algebra for H.
   Let us explain briefly how branching algebras, dual pairs and reciprocity are
related. For a reciprocity pair (G, g′ ), (H, h′ ), the duality correspondences are
subjugated to a correspondence in the space of harmonics H (see Theorem 3.1).
Branching from holomorphic discrete series of h′ to g′ behaves very much like finite-
dimensional representations in relation to their highest weights and is captured en-
tirely by the branching from the lowest KH ′ -type to KG′ . Although H is not an
algebra, it can still be identified as a quotient algebra of P(Cm ). With the G × KG′
as well as H × KH ′ multiplicity-free decomposition of H, one allows HNH ×NKG′
to be interpreted as a branching algebra from KH ′ to KG′ as well as a branching
algebra from G to H. This double interpretation solve two related branching prob-
lems simultaneously. Classical invariant theory also provides a flexible approach
which allows an inductive approach to the computation of branching algebras, and
makes evident natural connections between different branching algebras. We refer
to readers to [HTW] for more details.

  Regarding the dual pair (GLn × GLn , glp,q ⊕ glr,s ), Theorem 3.2 gives the de-

where the sum is over non-negative integer partitions µ+ , ν + , µ− , and ν − such
that:

Regarding the dual pair (GLn , glp+r,q+s ), Theorem 3.2 gives the decomposition:

where the sum is over all non-negative integer partitions λ+ and λ− such that
ℓ(λ+ ) + ℓ(λ− ) ≤ n, ℓ(λ+ ) ≤ p + r and ℓ(λ− ) ≤ q + s.
   We assume that we are in the stable range: n ≥ p + q + r + s, so that as a

Note that n ≥ p + q + r + s implies that n ≥ p + q and n ≥ r + s, so that (see

to obtain the result, but first note that in the above decompositions α, β, and γ
range over all non-negative integer partitions such that ℓ(α) ≤ p, ℓ(β) ≤ q and
ℓ(γ) ≤ min(p, q). So we obtain:

The above sum is over all non-negative integer partitions α, β, γ such that ℓ(α) ≤ p,
ℓ(β) ≤ q and ℓ(γ) ≤ min(p, q), however, the support of the Littlewood-Richardson
coefficients is contained inside the set of such (α, β, γ) when we choose p and q such
that ℓ(λ) ≤ ⌊n/2⌋ := p + q, with ℓ(µ) := p and ℓ(ν) := q.

The above sum is over all non-negative integer partitions α, β, γ such that ℓ(α) ≤ p,

where the sum is over all non-negative integer partitions λ such that ℓ(λ) ≤ k and

Using the fact that we are in the stable range:

where the sums are over all non-negative integer partitions γ and δ with at most p
and q parts respectively. We then obtain:

Combine this fact with the following two tensor product decompositions:
        α       2γ  ∼   L λ+ λ+                β     2δ  ∼   L λ− λ−
      F(p) ⊗ F(p)   =      cα 2γ F(p) and F(q)   ⊗ F(q)  =     cβ 2δ F(q)
and the result follows.

4.4.2. Sp2n ⊂ GL2n . We consider the following see-saw pair and its complexifici-

  Regarding the dual pair (GL2n , glp,q ), Theorem 3.2 gives the decomposition:

           P C2n ⊗ Cp ⊗ C2n ⊗ Cq ∼          =    F(2n)       ⊗ Fe(p,q)
where the sum is over non-negative integer partitions λ+ and λ− with at most p and
q parts respectively and such that ℓ(λ+ ) + ℓ(λ− ) ≤ 2n. Noting that (C2n )∗ ≃ C2n
as Sp2n modules, regarding the dual pair (Sp2n , so2(p+q) ), Theorem 3.2 gives the
decomposition:
                                      M λ
                      P C2n ⊗ Cp+q ∼  =      V(2n) ⊗ Ve(2(p+q))

where the sum is over all non-negative integer partitions λ such that ℓ(λ) ≤
min(2n, p + q).
