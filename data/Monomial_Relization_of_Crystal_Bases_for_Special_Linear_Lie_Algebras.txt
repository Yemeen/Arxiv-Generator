                                                      Abstract. We give a new realization of crystal bases for finite dimensional irreducible
                                                      modules over special linear Lie algebras using the monomials introduced by H. Nakajima.
                                                      We also discuss the connection between this monomial realization and the tableau realization
                                                      given by Kashiwara and Nakashima.

                                                The quantum groups, which are certain deformations of the universal enveloping algebras
                                             of Kac-Moody algebras, were introduced independently by V. G. Drinfeld and M. Jimbo
                                             [1, 4]. In [6, 7], M. Kashiwara developed the crystal basis theory for integrable modules
                                             over quantum groups. Crystal bases can be viewed as bases at q = 0 and they are given a
                                             structure of colored oriented graphs, called the crystal graphs. Crystal graphs have many nice
                                             combinatorial properties reflecting the internal structure of integrable modules. Moreover,
                                             crystal bases have a remarkably nice behavior with respect to taking the tensor product.
                                                In [13], while studying the structure of quiver varieties, H. Nakajima discovered that one
                                             can define a crystal structure on the set of irreducible components of a lagrangian subvariety Z
                                             of the quiver variety M. These irreducible components are identified with certain monomials,
                                             and the action of Kashiwara operators can be interpreted as multiplication by monomials.
                                             Moreover, in [13] and [8], M. Kashiwara and H. Nakajima gave a crystal structure on the set
                                             M of monomials and they showed that the connected component M(λ) of M containing a
                                             highest weight vector M with a dominant integral weight λ is isomorphic to the irreducible
                                             highest weight crystal B(λ). Therefore, a natural question arises: for each dominant integral
                                             weight λ, can we give an explicit characterization of the monomials in M(λ)?
                                               In this paper, for any dominant integral weight λ, we give an explicit description of the
                                             crystal M(λ) for special linear Lie algebras. In addition, we discuss the connection between
                                             the monomial realization and tableau realization of crystal bases given by Kashiwara and
                                             Nakashima. More precisely, let T (λ) denote the crystal consisting of semistandard tableaux

and T (λ), which has a very natural interpretation in the language of insertion scheme.

of 2002. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Professor M. Kashiwara for his

                                                    1. Crystal bases

  Let I be a finite set and set A = (aij )i,j∈I be a generalized Cartan matrix. Consider the
Cartan datum (A, Π, Π∨ , P, P ∨ ), where
                         M       M corankA
                                     M
                   P∨ = (  Zhi )  (        Zdj ) : the dual weight lattice,
                              i∈I                            j=1
                                          ∗     ∨
                   P = {λ ∈ h |λ(P ) ⊂ Z} : the weight lattice,
                   Π∨ = {hi | i ∈ I} : the set of simple coroots,
                   Π = {αi | i ∈ I} ⊂ h∗ : the simple roots.

Let h = Q ⊗Z P ∨ be the Cartan subalgebra and fix a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form
( | ) on h∗ satisfying:
                 (αi |αi )                    2(λ|αi )
                           ∈ Z>0 and λ(hi ) =           for all i ∈ I, λ ∈ h∗ .

   The quantum group Uq (g) associated with the cartan datum (A, Π, Π∨ , P, P ∨ ) is the asso-
ciative algebra over Q(q) with 1 generated by the elements ei , fi (i ∈ I) and q h (h ∈ P ∨ )

We also define Q =     i∈I   Zαi , Q+ =       i∈I   Z≥0 αi and
                             P + = {λ ∈ P | λ(hi ) ≥ 0 for all i ∈ I}.
In particular, the linear functional Λi ∈ P + (i ∈ I) defined by

  The category Oint consists of Uq (g)-modules M satisfying the properties:
            L
   (i) M = λ∈P Mλ with dimMλ < ∞, where
                         Mλ = {v ∈ M | q h v = q λ(h) v for all h ∈ P ∨ },
   (ii) there exist finitely many elements λ1 , · · · , λs ∈ P such that
                                      wt(M ) ⊂ sj=1 (λj − Q+ ),

         where wt(M ) = {λ ∈ P |Mλ 6= 0},
   (iii) ei and fi (i ∈ I) are locally nilpotent on M .
For each i ∈ I, it is well-known that every Uq (g)-module in the category Oint is a direct sum
of finite dimensional irreducible U(i) -submodules, where U(i) = hei , fi , Ki±1 i ∼
                                                                                   = Uq (sl2 ).

  Fix an index i ∈ I and set ei = eni /[n]i !, fi = fin /[n]i !. Then every weight vector
v ∈ Mλ can be written uniquely as

                                  v=         f i vk ,

with vk ∈ ker ei ∩ Mλ+kαi . We define the Kashiwara operators ẽi and f˜i on M by
                                X (k−1)                 X (k+1)

  Let A0 = {f /g ∈ Q(q) | f, g ∈ Q[q], g(0) 6= 0}.

Definition 1.1. A crystal basis of M is a pair (L, B) satisfying the following conditions:
 (i) L is a free A0 -submodule of M such that M ∼       = Q(q) ⊗A0 L,
                                 ∼
 (ii) B is a Q-basis of L/qL = Q ⊗A0 L,
            L
 (iii) L = λ∈P Lλ , where Lλ = L ∩ Mλ ,
            F
 (iv) B = λ∈P Bλ , where Bλ = B ∩ (Lλ /qLλ ),
 (v) ẽi L ⊂ L, f˜i L ⊂ L for all i ∈ I,
 (vi) ẽi B ⊂ B ∪ {0}, f˜i B ⊂ B ∪ {0} for all i ∈ I,
 (vii) for all b, b′ ∈ B and i ∈ I, f˜i b = b′ if and only if b = ẽi b′ .

The set B is given a colored oriented graph structure with the arrows defined by
                                 i
                              b −→ b′ if and only if f˜i b = b′ .
The graph B is called the crystal graph of M and it reflects the combinatorial structure of
M . For instance, we have
                               dimQ(q) Mλ = #Bλ           for all λ ∈ P .

Moreover, the crystal basis have a very nice behavior with respect to the tensor product. For
each b ∈ B and i ∈ I, we define

(1.4)          εi (b) = max{k ≥ 0| ẽki b ∈ B},        ϕi (b) = max{k ≥ 0| f˜ik b ∈ B}.

Then we have:

Proposition 1.2. [6, 7] Let Mj (j = 1, 2) be a Uq (g)-module in the category Oint and
(Lj , Bj ) be its crystal basis. Set

                                L = L1 ⊗A0 L2 ,        B = B1 × B2 .

Then (L, B) is a crystal basis of M1 ⊗Q(q) M2 , where        the Kashiwara operators on B are given
by

                         f˜i (b1 ⊗ b2 ) =
                                          b1 ⊗ f˜i b2 if    ϕi (b1 ) ≤ εi (b2 ).


    We close this section with the existence and uniqueness theorem for crystal bases.

Proposition 1.3. [7] Let V (λ) be the irreducible highest weight Uq (g)-module with highest
weight λ ∈ P + and highest weight vector vλ . Let L(λ) be the free A0 -submodule of V (λ)
spanned by the vectors of the form f˜i1 · · · f˜ir vλ (ik ∈ I, r ∈ Z≥0 ) and set

                      B(λ) = {f˜i1 · · · f˜ir uλ + qL(λ) ∈ L(λ)/qL(λ)} \ {0}.

Then (L(λ), B(λ)) is a crystal basis of V (λ) and every crystal basis of V (λ) is isomorphic to
(L(λ), B(λ)).




                                  2. Nakajama’s monomials

  In this section, we briefly recall the crystal structure on the set of monomials discovered
by H. Nakajima [13]. Our expression follows that of M. Kashiwara [8].
   Let M be the set of monomials in the variables Yi (n) for i ∈ I and n ∈ Z. Here, a typical
elements M of M has the form

(2.1)                              M = Yi1 (n1 )a1 · · · Yir (nr )ar ,

where ik ∈ I, nk , ak ∈ Z for k = 1, · · · , r. Since Yi (n)’s are commuting variables, we may
assume that n1 ≤ n2 ≤ · · · ≤ nr .

It is easy to verify that ϕi (M ) ≥ 0, εi (M ) ≥ 0, and hhi , wtM i = ϕi (M ) − εi (M ).
  First, we define
                                                                          s

                        nf = smallest ns such that ϕi (M ) =                      ak

                                                                              r

                            = smallest ns such that εi (M ) = −                        ak ,
                                                                            k=s+1
                                                                             ik =i
(2.3)                                                                 s
                                                                      X
                        ne = largest ns such that ϕi (M ) =                   ak
                                                                      k=1

                                                                           r
                                                                           X
                            = largest ns such that εi (M ) = −                     ak .
                                                                          k=s+1
                                                                           ik =i


In addition, choose a set C = (cij )i6=j of integers such that cij + cji = 1, and define
                                                   Y
                         Ai (n) = Yi (n)Yi (n + 1)     Yj (n + cji )αi (hj ) .
                                                            j6=i

   Now, the Kashiwara operators ẽi , f˜i (i ∈ I) on M are defined as follows:
                                     
                                     0                 if ϕi (M ) = 0,
                          ˜
                         fi (M ) =
                                     Ai (nf )−1 M if ϕi (M ) > 0,
(2.4)                                
                                     0              if εi (M ) = 0,
                         ẽi (M ) =
                                     Ai (ne )M if εi (M ) > 0.

Then the maps wt : M → P , ϕi , εi : M → Z ∪ {−∞}, ẽi , f˜i : M → M ∪ {0} define a
Uq (g)-crystal structure on M [8, 13].

  Moreover, we have

Proposition 2.1. [8]
  (i) For each i ∈ I, M is isomorphic to a crystal graph of an integrable U(i) -module.

   (ii) Let M be a monomial with weight λ such that ẽi M = 0 for all i ∈ I, and let M(λ) be
the connected component of M containing M . Then there exists a crystal isomorphism

                                3. Characterization of M(λ)

   In this section, we give an explicit characterization of the crystal M(λ) for special linear
Lie algebras. Let I = {1, · · · , n} and let A = (aij )i,j∈I be the generalized Cartan matrix of
type An . Here, the entries of A are given by
                                        

                                                 otherwise.
        MONOMIAL RELIZATION OF CRYSTAL BASES FOR SPECIAL LINEAR LIE ALGEBRAS                             7

We define by Uq (g) = Uq (sln+1 ) the corresponding quantum group. For simplicity, we take
the set C = (cij )i6=j to be
                                          
                                          0     if i > j,
(3.2)                               cij =
                                          1     if i < j,

and set Y0 (m)±1 = Yn+1 (m)±1 = 1 for all m ∈ Z. Then for i ∈ I and m ∈ Z, we have

(3.3)                     Ai (m) = Yi (m)Yi (m + 1)Yi−1 (m + 1)−1 Yi+1 (m)−1 .

To characterize M(λ), we first focus on the case when λ = Λk . Let M0 = Yk (m) for m ∈ Z.
By (2.2), we see that

                      wt(M0 ) = Λk , ϕi (M0 ) = δik and εi (M0 ) = 0 for all i ∈ I.

Hence ẽi M0 = 0 for all i ∈ I and the connected component containing M0 is isomorphic to
B(Λk ) over Uq (g). For simplicity, we will take M0 = Yk (0), even if that does not make much
difference.

Proposition 3.1. For k = 1, · · · , n, let M0 = Yk (0) be a highest weight vector of weight Λk .
Then the connected component M(Λk ) of M containing M0 is characterized as
           (   r
               Y                             (i) 0 ≤ a1 < b1 < a2 < · · · < ar < br ≤ n + 1,         )
M(Λk ) =           Yaj (mj−1 )−1 Ybj (mj ) | (ii) k = m0 > m1 > · · · > mr−1 > mr = 0,                .
               j=1                           (iii) aj + mj−1 = bj + mj for all j = 1, · · · , r ≤ k.
Proof. By Proposition 2.1, it suffices to prove the following statements:
   (a) For all i ∈ I, we have ẽi M(λ) ⊂ M(λ) ∪ {0}, f˜i M(λ) ⊂ M(λ) ∪ {0}.
   (b) For all M ∈ M(λ), there exist a sequence of indices i1 , · · · , it in I such that
                                                ẽi1 · · · ẽit M = M0 .

   Let i ∈ I and M = Ya1 (m0 )−1 Yb1 (m1 ) · · · Yar (mr−1 )−1 Ybr (mr ) ∈ M(Λk ). If i 6= bj for all
j, then ϕi (M ) = 0, which implies f˜i M = 0.
   If i = bj for some j, then ϕi (M ) = ϕbj (M ) = 1, nf = bj , and

                     Abj (mj ) = Ybj −1 (mj + 1)−1 Ybj (mj )Ybj (mj + 1)Ybj +1 (mj )−1 .

Hence we obtain
    f˜i M = Ab (mj )−1 M
                 j

           = Ya1 (m0 )−1 Yb1 (m1 ) · · · Yaj (mj−1 )−1 Ybj −1 (mj + 1)
               × Ybj (mj + 1)−1 Ybj +1 (mj )Yaj+1 (mj )−1 Ybj+1 (mj+1 ) · · · Yar (mr−1 )−1 Ybr (mr ).
If aj < bj − 1 and bj + 1 < aj+1 , then since aj + mj−1 = (bj − 1) + (mj + 1), bj + (mj + 1) =
(bj + 1) + mj , it is easy to see that f˜i M ∈ M(Λk ). If aj = bj − 1, then since aj + mj−1 =
(bj − 1) + (mj + 1), we have mj−1 = mj + 1, which implies Yaj (mj−1 )−1 Ybj −1 (mj + 1) = 1.
On the other hand, if bj + 1 = aj+1 , then Ybj +1 (mj )Yaj+1 (mj )−1 = 1 and bj + (mj + 1) =
aj+1 + mj = bj+1 + mj+1 . Hence f˜i M ∈ M(Λk ).
8                       SEOK-JIN KANG, JEONG-AH KIM AND DONG-UY SHIN

    Similarly, one can prove ẽi M ∈ M(Λk ) ∪ {0}.
 To prove (b), we have only to show that if M ∈ M(Λk ) and ẽi M = 0 for all i ∈ I, then
M = M0 = Yk (0). But this is obvious, for otherwise, we would have εaj (M ) = 1 6= 0.  

Remark 3.2. If we take M0 = Yk (N ), then we have only to modify the condition for mj ’s as
follows:
                           k + N = m0 > m1 > · · · > mr−1 > mr = N.

    For i ∈ I and m ∈ Z, we introduce new variables

(3.4)                        Xi (m) = Yi−1 (m + 1)−1 Yi (m).

Using this notation, every monomial M = rj=1 Yaj (mj−1 )−1 Ybj (mj ) ∈ M(Λk ) may be
                                            Q

written as
                       Yr
                  M=      Xaj +1 (mj−1 − 1)Xaj +2 (mj−1 − 2) · · · Xbj (mj ).
                           j=1

For example, we have M0 = Yk (0) = X1 (k − 1)X2 (k − 2) · · · Xk (0).
 Now, it is straightforward to verify that we have another characterization of the crystal
M(Λk ).

Corollary 3.3. For k = 1, · · · , n, we have
          M(Λk ) = {Xi1 (k − 1)Xi2 (k − 2) · · · Xik (0) | 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤ n + 1}.

Remark 3.4. If we take M0 = Yk (N ), then we need to replace Xi (m) by Xi (m + N ). That is,

    M(Λk ) = {Xi1 (N + k − 1)Xi2 (N + k − 2) · · · Xik (N ) | 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤ n + 1}.

    We now consider the general case.

Definition 3.5. Set M = t Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (nt ) with at + mt = bt + nt .
                             Q

 (a) For each k = 0, · · · , n − 1, we define M (k)+ to be the product of Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (nt )’s in
M with nt = k; that is,
                                            Y
                                M (k)+ =         Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (nt )
                                              t:nt =k
                                              Y
                                          =        Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (k).

  (b) For each k = 1, · · · , n, we define M (k)− to be the product of Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (nt )’s in M

   Now, for M (k)+ = t Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (k), we denote by λ+ (M (k)) the sequence (bi1 , bi2 , · · · , bir )
                     Q

whose terms are arranged in such a way that n + 1 ≥ bi1 ≥ bi2 ≥ · · · ≥ bir . Similarly, for
M (k)− = t Yat (k)−1 Ybt (nt ), we denote by λ− (M (k)) the sequence (aj1 , aj2 , · · · , ajs ) whose
          Q

terms are arranged in such a way that n + 1 > aj1 ≥ aj2 ≥ · · · ≥ ajs .

Definition 3.6. Let (λ1 , · · · , λr ) and (µ1 , · · · , µs ) be the sequences such that
                        λi ≥ λi+1 (1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1),        µj ≥ µj+1 (1 ≤ j ≤ s − 1).
We define (λ1 , · · · , λr ) ≺ (µ1 , · · · , µs ) if
                                    r ≤ s and λi < µi for all i = 1, · · · , r.

Example 3.7. Let M be a monomial (Y1 (2)−1 Y3 (0)) · (Y0 (2)−1 Y1 (1)) · (Y2 (1)−1 Y3 (0)). Then
                                 M (0)+ = (Y1 (2)−1 Y3 (0)) · (Y2 (1)−1 Y3 (0)),
                                 M (1)+ = Y0 (2)−1 Y1 (1),
                                 M (1)− = Y2 (1)−1 Y3 (0),
                                 M (2)− = (Y1 (2)−1 Y3 (0)) · (Y0 (2)−1 Y1 (1)).

Moreover, the sequences λ+ (M (0)) = (3, 3), λ+ (M (1)) = (1), λ− (M (1)) = (2), and λ− (M (2)) =
(1, 0). Therefore, λ+ (M (1)) ≺ λ− (M (1)).

Theorem 3.8. Let λ = a1 Λ1 + · · · + an Λn be a dominant integral weight and let M0 =
Y1 (0)a1 · · · Yn (0)an be a highest weight vector of weight λ in M. The connected component
M(λ) in M containing M0 is characterized as the set of monomials of the form
                                         Y
                                            Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (nt )
                                                i

with at + mt = bt + nt satisfying the following conditions:
     (i) λ+ (M (k)) ≺ λ− (M (k)) for k = 1, · · · , n − 1.
    (ii) If λ+ (M (k)) = (bi1 , bi2 , · · · , bir ) and λ− (M (k)) = (aj1 , aj2 , · · · , ajs ), then s − r = ak .

Proof. As in Proposition 3.1, it suffices to prove the following statements:
  (a) For all i = 1, · · · , n, we have

                            ẽi M(λ) ⊂ M(λ) ∪ {0},         f˜i M(λ) ⊂ M(λ) ∪ {0}.

   (b) If M ∈ M(λ) and ẽi M = 0 for all i ∈ I, then M = M0 .
   We first prove the statement (a). Let i ∈ I and M = t Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (nt ) be a monomial
                                                        Q

of M(λ). Assume that f˜i M 6= 0. Then i = bt for some t and f˜bt M is obtained from M by
multiplying
                      Abt (nt )−1 = Ybt −1 (nt + 1)Ybt (nt )−1 Ybt (nt + 1)−1 Ybt +1 (nt ).
If we express as M = Yat (mt )−1 Ybt (nt )M ′ , then f˜bt M is expressed as

                       f˜bt M = Yat (mt )−1 Ybt −1 (nt + 1)Ybt (nt + 1)−1 Ybt +1 (nt )M ′ .
10                        SEOK-JIN KANG, JEONG-AH KIM AND DONG-UY SHIN


Note that (f˜bt M )(k)− = M (k)− and (f˜bt M )(k)+ = M (k)+ unless k = nt and nt + 1. At
first, consider the case when k = nt . Let λ− (M (nt )) = (aj1 , aj2 , · · · , ajs ) and λ+ (M (nt )) =
(bi1 , · · · , bip = bt , · · · , bir ). Since λ− (M (nt )) > λ+ (M (nt )), ajp > bip = bt . If ajp > bt + 1,
then we have
                                   λ− (f˜bt M (nt )) = (aj1 , · · · , ajp , · · · , ajs ),
                           λ+ (f˜bt M (nt )) = (bi1 , · · · , bip = bt + 1, · · · , bir )
If ajp = bt + 1, then we have

                           λ− (f˜bt M (nt )) = (aj1 , · · · , ajp−1 , ajp+1 , · · · , ajs ),
                           λ+ (f˜bt M (nt )) = (bi1 , · · · , bjp−1 , bjp+1 , · · · , bir )

It is clear that f˜bt M satisfies the condition (i) and (ii). Secondly, for the case k = nt + 1, we
have

λ− ((f˜bt M )(nt + 1)) = λ− (M (nt + 1)) ∪ {bt },          λ+ ((f˜bt M )(nt + 1)) = λ+ (M (nt + 1)) ∪ {bt − 1}.

Hence f˜bt M ∈ M(λ).
     Similarly, we can prove that ẽi M(λ) ⊂ M(λ) ∪ {0}.
    To prove (b), suppose M ∈ M(λ) and ẽi M = 0 for all i ∈ I. Then by the definition of the
εi (M ), M = t Y0 (bt )−1 Ybt (0). Since wt(M ) = a1 Λ1 + · · · + an Λn and wt(Yk (0)) = Λk , we
              Q
                                   Qa1 +···+an
have M = Y1 (0)a1 · · · Yn (0)an = t=1         Y0 (bt )−1 Ybt (0).                             

Remark 3.9. The crystal M(λ) is obtained by multiplying ak -many monomials in M(Λk )
(k = 1, · · · , n). That is,

     M(λ) = {M = M1,1 · · · M1,a1 M2,1 · · · Mn,an | Mk,l ∈ M(Λk ) for 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ ak }.

Example 3.10. Let λ be a dominant integral weight Λ1 + 2Λ2 + Λ3 of A4 and let M =
Y1 (0)Y1 (1)Y1 (2)−1 Y2 (1)−1 Y3 (0)3 . Then M can be expressed as
             M = Y0 (3)−1 Y3 (0)Y1 (2)−1 Y3 (0)Y0 (2)−1 Y1 (1)Y2 (1)−1 Y3 (0)Y0 (1)−1 Y1 (0).
Therefore, we have

                  M (0)+ = Y0 (3)−1 Y3 (0)Y1 (2)−1 Y3 (0)Y2 (1)−1 Y3 (0)Y0 (1)−1 Y1 (0),
                  M (1)+ = Y0 (2)−1 Y1 (1),          M (2)+ = M (3)+ = 1,

and
                                  M (1)− = Y2 (1)−1 Y3 (0)Y0 (1)−1 Y1 (0),
                                  M (2)− = Y1 (2)−1 Y3 (0)Y0 (2)−1 Y1 (1),
                                  M (3)− = Y0 (3)−1 Y3 (0),
                                  M (4)− = 1.
It is easy to see that M satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3.8. Therefore, M ∈ M(λ).

   (ii) for each j = 1, · · · , n − 1, λ(M (j)) ≺ λ(M (j − 1)).

Example 3.13. Let λ be a dominant integral weight Λ1 + 2Λ2 + Λ3 of A4 and let M be a
monomial Y1 (0)Y1 (1)Y1 (2)−1 Y2 (1)−1 Y3 (0)3 given in Example 3.10. Then M can be expressed
as
                                     X1 (2)X2 (1)2 X1 (1)X3 (0)3 X1 (0)
and so

Moreover, since
                M (2) = X1 (2), M (1) = X1 (1)X2 (1)2 and M (0) = X1 (0)X3 (0)3 ,
we know that λ(M (j)) ≺ λ(M (j − 1)) for all j = 1, 2, 3. Therefore, M ∈ M(λ).

                                                                                            Xi (j)mij , there are mi,j

  Consider the condition (ii) in Corollary 3.12. For M =                          1≤i≤n+1
                                                                                  0≤j≤n−1
-many i entries in the sequence λ(M (j)). Therefore, the condition λ(M (j)) ≺ λ(M (j − 1))
implies that
                  m1,n = 0, mij = 0 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n + 1, n − i + 2 ≤ j ≤ n,

  Therefore, Corollary 3.12 is expressed as follows:

                               4. The connection with Young tableaux

   In this section, we give the correspondence between monomial realization and tableau
realization of crystal base for the classical Lie algebra g = An . To prove the results in this
section, we will adopt the expression of monomials given in Corollary 3.12.
   Before we give the correspondence between monomial realization and tableau realization,
we introduce certain tableaux with given shape which is different from Young diagram given
by Kashiwara and Nakashima.

Definition 4.1. (i) We define a reverse Young diagram to be a collection of boxes in right-
justified rows with a weakly decreasing number of boxes in each row from bottom to top.
   (ii) We define a (reverse) tableau by a reverse Young diagram filled with positive integers.
   (iii) A (reverse) tableau S is called a (reverse) semistandard tableau if the entries in S are
weakly increasing from left right in each row and strictly increasing from top to bottom in
each column.

Remark 4.2. A reverse Young diagram is just a diagram obtained by reflecting Young diagram
to the origin.

  Let λ be a dominant integral weight. Let S(λ) (resp. T (λ)) be the set of all (reverse)
semistandard tableaux (resp. semistandard tableaux) of shape λ with entries on {1, 2, · · · , n},
which is realized as crystal basis of finite dimensional irreducible modules [9, 11]. For the
fundamental weight Λk (k = 1, · · · , n), we have T (Λk ) = S(Λk ).

Theorem 4.3. Let λ = a1 Λ1 + · · · + an Λn be a dominant integral weight. Then there is a
crystal isomorphism ψ : M(λ) → S(λ).

Proof. Let M be a monomial in M(λ). Then M is expressed as
                                      Y
                               M=         Xi (j)mij .
                                                       1≤i≤n+1
                                                       0≤j≤n−1


We define ψ(M ) to be the semistandard tableau with mij -many i entries in (j + 1)-st row
(from bottom to top) for i = 1, · · · , n + 1, j = 0, 1, · · · , n − 1. Indeed, by the condition (ii) of
        MONOMIAL RELIZATION OF CRYSTAL BASES FOR SPECIAL LINEAR LIE ALGEBRAS                     13

Corollary 3.14, the tableau ψ(M ) is of shape λ. Moreover, the condition (i) and (iii) imply
that ψ(M ) is semistandard.
  Conversely, let S be a tableau of S(λ) with mi,j -many i entries in the j-th row (from
bottom to top) for i = 1, · · · , n + 1 and j = 1, · · · , n. We define ψ −1 (S) by the monomial
                                          Y
                                               Xi (j − 1)mi,j .
                                       1≤i≤n+1
                                        1≤j≤n


Then since S is semistandard, it is easy to see that ψ −1 (S) satisfies the condition (i)-(iii) of
Corollary 3.14. Moreover, it is clear that ψ and ψ −1 are inverses of each other.
   Now, it remains to show that ψ is a crystal morphism. Let M = Xi (j)mij be a monomial
                                                                         Q

in M(λ). Let Xa (k1 ) and Xa (k2 ) be the monomials corresponding to the entries a in Si,j
and Si′ ,j ′ , respectively. By the definitions of ψ(M ) and Si,j (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ ak ), we have
the following fact:

                          If k1 > k2 , then i > i′ , or i = i′ and j > j ′ .

Therefore, from the definition of Kashiwara operators on the set M of monomials and the
tensor product rule of Kashiwara operators which is applied to the set S(λ), it is easy to see
that ψ is a crystal morphism of Uq (An )-modules.                                           

Example 4.4. Let λ be a dominant integral weight Λ1 + 2Λ2 + Λ3 of A3 and let M be a
monomial Y1 (3)−1 Y2 (0)2 Y3 (1)−1 , then it can be expressed as
                        M = Y1 (3)−1 Y4 (0)(Y0 (2)−1 Y2 (0))2 Y3 (1)−1 Y4 (0)
and so it is a monomial of M(Λ1 + 2Λ2 + Λ3 ). Moreover, M is also expressed as
              M = X2 (2)X3 (1)X1 (1)2 X4 (0)2 X2 (0)2
                 = (X2 (2)X3 (1)X4 (0)) × (X1 (1)X4 (0)) × (X1 (1)X2 (0)) × X2 (0).

Then we have the matrix (mij ) (1 ≤ i ≤ 4, 0 ≤ j ≤ 3) and the semistandard tableau
S ∈ S(Λ1 + 2Λ2 + Λ3 ) as follows:

                                                  
                                   0   2   0   0

  We have the following proposition between S(λ) and T (λ).

Proposition 4.5. [10, 11] For a dominant integral weight λ = a1 Λ1 + · · · + an Λn , there is
a crystal isomorphism ϕ : S(λ) → T (λ) for Uq (An )-module given by

                 ϕ(S) = Sn,1 ← Sn,2 ← · · · ← Sn,an ← Sn−1,1 ← · · · ← S1,a1 ,

where Si,j ∈ S(Λi ) is the column of S of length i (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ ai ) from right to left.

Corollary 4.6. Let λ = a1 Λ1 + · · · + an Λn be a dominant integral weight. There is a crystal
isomorphism φ : M(λ) → T (λ).

Proof. By Theorem 4.3 and Proposition 4.5, φ = ϕ ◦ ψ is a crystal isomorphism.                         

Example 4.7. Let M be a monomial Y1 (3)−1 Y2 (0)2 Y3 (1)−1 of A3 given in Example 4.4.
Then we have
                       φ(M ) = S3,1 ← S2,2 ← S2,1 ← S1,1
                                             2
                                                         1               1
                                         =   3   ←               ←           ←    2
                                                         4               2
                                             4

                                         =   2   2       3           .

     Conversely, let T be a tableau of T (Λ1 + 2Λ2 + Λ3 )
                                                     1       1       2   4

                                             T =     2       2       3       .
                                                     4

By applying the reverse bumping rule to the entries from bottom to top and from right to
left, i.e., from the entry 4 of the rightmost column to the entry 1 on top of the leftmost
column, we have the following sequence
                                          (2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2).
Therefore, we have
                                 2
                                                 1                           1
                       S3,1 =    3   , S2,2 =        ,, S2,1 =                   and S1,1 =   2   ,
                                                 4                           2
                                 4

and since
                    ψ −1 (S3,1 ) = X2 (2)X3 (1)X4 (0), ψ −1 (S2,2 ) = X1 (1)X4 (0),
                           ψ −1 (S2,1 ) = X1 (1)X2 (0), ψ −1 (S1,1 ) = X2 (0),
we have
                       ϕ−1 (T ) = ψ −1 (S3,1 )ψ −1 (S2,2 )ψ −1 (S2,1 )ψ −1 (S1,1 )
                                = Y1 (3)−1 Y4 (0)(Y0 (2)−1 Y2 (0))2 Y3 (1)−1 Y4 (0)
                                = Y1 (3)−1 Y2 (0)2 Y3 (1)−1 .
