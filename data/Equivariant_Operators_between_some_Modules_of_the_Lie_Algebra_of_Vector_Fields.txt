                                             space C ∞ (M ) of smooth functions of M, and by Dpk the space of differential
                                             operators of order smaller than or equal to k, from Ωp (M ) into N . If X ∈

                                             is a differential operator of order at most k and so (Dpk , L) is a V ect(M )-module.
                                                                                                     k,ℓ

                                             from Dpk into Dqℓ , that is all operators T : Dpk → Dqℓ such that

solve here an analogous problem, thus answering a question of P. Lecomte,
who noticed that some homotopy operator, which locally coincides—up to a
coefficient—with the Koszul differential (see [2]), is equivariant if it’s restricted
to low order differential operators and asked whether this property still holds
for higher orders.


2     Local representation
The formalism described in this section was also used in [5] and [6].
   Consider an open subset U of IRm , two real finite-dimensional vector spaces
E and F , and some local operator
                         O ∈ L(C ∞ (U, E), C ∞ (U, F ))loc .
The operator is fully defined by its values on the products f e, f ∈ C ∞ (U ), e ∈ E.
A well known theorem of J. Peetre (see [4]) states that it has the form
                             X                     X
                    O(f e) =      Oα (∂ α (f e)) =   Oα (e)∂ α f,
                               α                   α
                1       m
where ∂xα = ∂xα1 . . . ∂xαm and Oα ∈ C ∞ (U, L(E, F )). Moreover, the coefficients
Oα are well determined by O and the series is locally finite (it is finite, if U is
relatively compact).
                                                                                1
    We shall symbolize the partial derivative ∂ α f by the monomial ξ α = ξ1α . . .
   m
  α
ξm   in the components ξ1 , . . . , ξm of some linear form ξ ∈ (IRm )∗ , or—at least
mentally—even by ξ α f, if this is necessary to avoid confusion. The operator O
is thus represented by the polynomial
                                           X
                               O(ξ; e) =     Oα (e)ξ α .

When identifying the space P ol(IR ) of polynomials on (IRm )∗ with the space
                                     m ∗

∨IRm of symmetric contravariant tensors of IRm , one has O ∈ C ∞ (U, ∨IRm ⊗
L(E, F )). Let’s emphasize that the form ξ symbolizes the derivatives in O that
act on the argument f e ∈ C ∞ (U, E), while e ∈ E represents this argument. In
the sequel, we shall no longer use different notations for the operator O and its
representative polynomial O; in order to simplify notations, it’s helpful to use
even the same typographical sign, when referring to the argument f e and its
representation e.
    Let’s for instance look for the local representation of (1). If D ∈ Dpk , its
restriction D|U (or simply D, if no confusion is possible) to a domain U of local
coordinates of M , is a local operator from C ∞ (U, ∧p (IRm )∗ ) into C ∞ (U ) that is
represented by D(ω) ≃ D(ξ; ω), where ω ∈ C ∞ (U, ∧p (IRm )∗ ) on the l.h.s. and
ω ∈ ∧p (IRm )∗ on the r.h.s., and where ξ represents the derivatives acting on
ω. The Lie derivative of D(ω) with respect to a vector field X ∈ C ∞ (U ; IRm ),
is then represented by LX (D(ω)) ≃ hX, η + ξiD(ξ; ω). Here η ∈ (IRm )∗ is
associated to D and hX, η + ξi denotes the evaluation of X ∈ IRm on η + ξ.
When associating ζ to X, one gets D(LX ω) ≃ D(ξ + ζ; hX, ξiω + ζ ∧ iX ω) and
      (LX D)(ω) ≃ hX, ηiD(ξ; ω) − hX, ξiτζ D(ξ; ω) − D(ξ + ζ; ζ ∧ iX ω),          (3)
where τζ D(ξ; ω) = D(ξ + ζ; ω) − D(ξ; ω).

3     Locality of equivariant operators
Let U be a domain of local coordinates of M . If D ∈ Dpk|U (Dpk|U is defined simi-
larly to Dpk , but for M = U ), its representation is a polynomial D in C ∞ (U, Epk ),
where Epk = ∨≤k IRm ⊗∧p IRm , or—equivalently—in the space of smooth sections
Γ(∨≤k T U ⊗ ∧p T U ). We denote by σ(D) or simply σ the homogeneous part of
maximal degree of this polynomial i.e. the principal symbol of the considered
differential operator. If Lt is the natural Lie derivative of tensor fields, one
easily verifies that
      LtX (σ(D)) (ξ; ω) = hX, ηiσ(ξ; ω) − hX, ξi(ζ∂ξ )σ(ξ; ω) − σ(ξ; ζ ∧ iX ω),
                  

where η and ζ are associated to σ and X respectively, and where ζ∂ξ de-
notes the derivation with respect to ξ in the direction of ζ. If Lop is the for-
merly defined Lie derivative L of differential operators, it follows from (3) that
(σ(Lop                t
    X D)) (ξ; ω) = (LX (σ(D))) (ξ; ω) i.e. that the principal symbol is equivari-
ant with respect to all vector fields.

    We are now prepared to prove the following lemma:
                                        k,ℓ
Lemma 1 Every equivariant operator T ∈ Ip,q is local.

    Proof. It suffices to show that the family Lkp = {LX : Dpk −→ Dpk | X ∈
V ect(M )} is closed with respect to locally finite sums and is locally transitive
(lt); this means that each point of M has some neighborhood Ω, such that for
every open subset ω ⊂ Ω and every D ∈ Dpk with compact support in ω, D can
be decomposed into Lie derivatives,
                 n
                 X
            D=         LXi Di (Di ∈ Dpk , supp Xi ⊂ ω, supp Di ⊂ ω),              (4)
                 i=1

with n independent of D and Ω. Indeed, proposition 3 of [1] states that Lkp is
then globally transitive i.e. that (4) holds for every open subset ω of M and
every D ∈ Dpk with support in ω. Take now a differential operator D ∈ Dpk
that vanishes in an open subset V of M and let x0 be an arbitrary point of V .
Since supp DP  ⊂ ω = M \ω0 for some neighborhood ω0 of x0 , D has form (4) and
                 n
T (D)(x0 ) = i=1 (LXi (T (Di ))) (x0 ) = 0.
     In order to confirm local transitivity (LT), let’s point out that example 12
of [1] shows that the family £rs = {LX : Γ(⊗rs M ) −→ Γ(⊗rs M ) | X ∈ V ect(M )}
is lt, if
                                     s − r 6= m.                                  (5)
Moreover, the domains U of the charts of M that correspond to cubes in IRm ,
play the role of the neighborhoods Ω in the definition of LT.
   LT of Lkp may now be proved as follows. If x ∈ M , take Ω = U and if
D ∈ Dpk is a differential operator with compact support in some open subset ω
of U , note that its principal symbol σ(D) is a contravariant tensor field with
compact support in ω. Hence condition (5) is satisfied and

4     Local expression of the equivariance equation
Let U be a connected, relatively compact domain of local coordinates of M .
    Recall that if D ∈ Dpk|U , its representation is a polynomial D ∈ C ∞ (U, Epk ),
where Epk = ∨≤k IRm ⊗ ∧p IRm .
    We identify Dpk |U with C ∞ (U, Epk ). Thus, if T ∈ Ip,q    k,ℓ
                                                                    , the restriction
T |U is a local operator from C ∞ (U, Epk ) into C ∞ (U, Eqℓ ), with representation
T (η; D)(ξ; ω) (η, ξ ∈ (IRm )∗ , D ∈ Epk , ω ∈ ∧q (IRm )∗ ).
    It’s easily checked that equivariance condition (2) locally reads

      (X.T )(η; D)(ξ; ω) − hX, ηi(τζ T (η; D))(ξ; ω)
          −hX, ξiτζ (T (η; D))(ξ; ω) + T (η + ζ; Xτζ D)(ξ; ω)
           −T (η; D)(ξ + ζ; ζ ∧ iX ω) + T (η + ζ; D(· + ζ; ζ ∧ iX ·))(ξ; ω) = 0,            (6)

where X.T is obtained by derivation of the coefficients of T in the direction of
X.
   Take in equation (6) the terms of degree 0 in ζ:

                                  (X.T )(η; D)(ξ; ω) = 0.

This means that the coefficients of T are constant.
   The terms of degree 1 lead to the equation

             hX, ηi(ζ∂η )T (η; D)(ξ; ω)
                  −T (η; X(ζ∂ξ )D)(ξ; ω) − T (η; D(· ; ζ ∧ iX ·))(ξ; ω)
                  +hX, ξi(ζ∂ξ )T (η; D)(ξ; ω) + T (η; D)(ξ; ζ ∧ iX ω) = 0,

which, if ρ denotes the natural action of gl(m, IR), may be rewritten

                              ρ(X ⊗ ζ) (T (η; D)(ξ; ω)) = 0.

Note that T (η; D)(ξ; ω) is completely characterized by T (η; Y r ⊗ (X1 ∧ . . . ∧
Xp ))(ξ; ν 1 ∧ . . . ∧ ν q ) (Y, Xi ∈ IRm , ν j ∈ (IRm )∗ , r ∈ {0, . . . , k}). This last
expression is a polynomial in Y, Xi and in η, ξ, ν j . It thus follows from the de-
scription of invariant polynomials under the action of gl(m, IR) (see [7]), that
it is a polynomial Tr (hY, ξi, hY, ηi, hY, ν j i, hXi , ξi, hXi , ηi, hXi , ν j i) in the evalu-
ations of the vectors on the linear forms.
      In order to determine the most general structure of Tr , observe that this
polynomial is homogeneous of degree r in Y and degree 1 in the Xi ’s and the
ν j ’s, and that furthermore it’s antisymmetric in the Xi ’s and the ν j ’s. It follows
from the skew-symmetry in the ν j ’s, that Y is evaluated on at most one ν j , so
that q ≤ p + 1, and from the skew-symmetry in the Xi ’s, that ξ and η are
evaluated on at most one Xi , so that q ≥ p − 2. Finally, q is p − 2, p − 1, p or
p+1. Set now Λ = X1 ∧. . .∧Xp , ω = ν 1 ∧. . .∧ν q , u = hY, ξi and v = hY, ηi. The

   It’s interesting to rewrite (6) in terms of the Tr ’s (r ∈ {0, . . . , k}). To
simplify notations, we set

Remark 2 In the sequel, we suppose that dimension m is not only ≥ sup(p, q),
but also ≥ inf {p + 2, q + 3}. In the skipped borderline cases, results have to be
completed, but proofs are not elegant.

     We claim that (9) is a polynomial identity in the independent variables
λ, . . . , δpq . Indeed, since as well the vectors X, Y, Xi as the forms ξ, η, ζ, ν j are
arbitrary, take X = e1 , Y = e2 , Xi = ei+2 (ek : canonical basis of IRm ) and let
the p + 2 first components of the preceding forms in the dual basis of ek vary in
IR, if inf {p + 2, q + 3} = p + 2; proceed similarly but exchange roles of vectors
and forms, if inf {p + 2, q + 3} = q + 3.

5       Determination of the equivariant operators
                                         k,ℓ
Proposition 1 Equivariant operators T ∈ Ip,q are mappings
                             k+1                                 k−1
                 T : Dpk −→ Dp−1 , T : Dpk −→ Dpk or T : Dpk −→ Dp+1 .
                        k,k+1
    Proof. If T ∈ Ip,p−2      , it follows from (7) and (10) that Tr = cr αr0 det(αi , βi , δij )
(r ∈ {0, . . . , k}, cr ∈ IR) and from (11) that Tr = 0 (r ∈ {0, . . . , k}). Hence the
result (see remark 1).

5.1      Case q = p + 1
                          k,k−1
Proposition 2 All spaces Ip,p+1 vanish, except
                1,0
(i) the spaces Ip,p+1 with bases defined by equation (18), and
                2,1
(ii) the space I0,1 with basis defined by equation (19).

    Proof. Equations (7) and (10) show that Tr = cr αr−1
                                                     0   det(διj )(r ∈ {0, . . . , k},
cr ∈ IR). Moreover, equations (12) and (14) yield

                               (r − 1)cr = rcr−1 (r ∈ {3, . . . , k}),                                   (16)


                              2(r − 1)cr = rcr−1 (r ∈ {2, . . . , k}).                                   (17)
Equivariant operators                                                               8


If k ≥ 3, (16) and (17) imply that each invariant vanishes. If k = 2, (17)
confirms that c1 = c2 = c (c ∈ IR). If in addition p > 0, (15), written for
r = 2, gives c = 0. If (k, p) = (2, 0) or k = 1, all local invariants have the form
T0 = 0, T1 = chY, νi, T2 = chY, ξihY, νi resp. T0 = 0, T1 = c det(διj ).

   In [2], P. Lecomte introduced—in a more general framework—some homo-
topy operator K for the dual d∗ of the de Rham differential d.
                                 ′      1                               ′
P It’s well-known
               P that each D ∈ Dp admits a global decomposition D =
  hΛ, LX ·i + hΩ, ·i, where the sums are finite, where Λ and Ω are anti-
symmetric contravariant p -tensors on M, and where X denotes a vector field
of M. Similarly,Pany differential
P                           P       operator D′′ ∈ D02 may be written D′′ =
   Λ LX ◦ LY + Ω LZ + Θ, with Λ, Ω, Θ ∈ N and X, Y, Z ∈ V ect(M ).
   One easily verifies that
                                          1 X
                         K|Dp1 (D′ ) =          hΛ, iX ·i              (18)
                                       1+p
and that
                              1X                         X
                K|D02 (D′′ ) =      Λ (iX LY + LX iY ) +     Ω iZ .              (19)
                              2
For the first formula for instance, it suffices to remember that
       hΛ, LX ωi ≃ hX, ξi(X1 ∧ . . . ∧ Xp )(ω) + (X1 ∧ . . . ∧ Xp )(ζ ∧ iX ω),
with unmistakable notations (see section 2), and to use the local representation
of K (see [2]).
    These results imply that—in the implicated cases—the homotopy operator
is independent of the local coordinates and the partition of unity involved in
its construction. Furthermore, the r.h.s. of (18) and (19) is independent of the
chosen decomposition of D′ and D′′ respectively. It’s now obvious that
                        K : Dp1 → Dp+1
                                   0
                                       and K : D02 → D11
are equivariant operators.
                        1,0        2,1
   Finally, the spaces Ip,p+1 and I0,1 are generated by K.

5.2    Case q = p − 1 (p > 0)
                          k,k+1
Proposition 3 The spaces Ip,p−1 are one-dimensional vector spaces with basis
d∗ .
    Proof. Equations (7), (10), and (11) tell us that Tr = cr αr0 det(αi , δij )
(r ∈ {0, . . . , k}, cr ∈ IR) and equation (13) brings out that cr = c (r ∈
{0, . . . , k}, c ∈ IR).
                         k,k+1
   Since obviously d∗ ∈ Ip,p−1 , the conclusion follows.

5.3    Case q = p
                              k,k                                   k,k
Proposition 4 The spaces Ip,p     are one-dimensional, except I0,0      (k > 0) and
 1,1
Ip,p (p > 0) that have dimension 2. Possible bases are id, (id, I0 ) resp. (id, d∗ K),
where I0 is defined by I0 : D → D(1)id (1 stands for the constant function
x → 1).
Equivariant operators                                                                            9


   Proof. (i) Look first at the case p = 0. Equations (7), (10), and (12) show
that T0 = c0 (c0 ∈ IR) and Tr = cαr0 (r ∈ {1, . . . , k}, c ∈ IR).

    If k = 0, the space of invariants is generated by id. Otherwise, dimension of
 k,k
I0,0  is 2 and the invariants id and I0 form a basis.

    (ii) If p > 0, it follows from equations (7), (8), (10), and (11) that
                                     p
                                     X
   Tr = cr αr0 det(δij ) + dr αr−1
                               0           αn detn0 (δij ) (r ∈ {0, . . . , k}, cr , dr ∈ IR).
                                     n=1


In this expression, detn0 (δij ) denotes the determinant det(δij ), where the line
(δn1 , . . . , δnp ) has been replaced by (δ01 , . . . , δ0p ). When exploiting equations (13)
and (14), you find (r − 1)dr = rdr−1 (r ∈ {2, . . . , k}) resp. 2(r − 1)dr =
rdr−1 (r ∈ {2, . . . , k}), so that dr = 0 (r ∈ {0, . . . , k}), if k ≥ 2. Apply now
equation (15). If k ≥ 2, this condition shows that

                      Tr = cαr0 det(δij ) (r ∈ {0, . . . , k}, c ∈ IR)

and if k = 1, it entails that c1 − c0 + d1 = 0.

   If k = 0 or k ≥ 2, invariants are thus generated by id. In the case k = 1,
                               1,1
dimension is 2 and id, d∗ K ∈ Ip,p are possible generators.
