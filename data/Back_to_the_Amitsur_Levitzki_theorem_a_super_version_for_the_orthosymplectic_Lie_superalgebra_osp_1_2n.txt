                                                The Amitsur-Levitzki theorem states that gl(n) satisfies the standard polynomial iden-
                                            tity of order 2n. More precisely:

                                            Amitsur and Levitzki proved their theorem using an inductive method that does not explain
                                            why such identity exists [1, 7]. Later, several simplifications and improvements of their
                                            proof, including graphical ones and several new proofs, were given [11, 22, 7, 19, 18, 20,
                                            9]. However, all of these proofs but Kostant’s lack a real interpretation of the result.
                                               Eight years after Amitsur-Levitzki , B. Kostant published a truly beautiful proof of
                                            their theorem, based on the cohomology of Lie algebras [11]. Besides explaining the
                                            existence of the theorem, Kostant proved with his method that o(2n) satisfies the standard
                                            polynomial identity of order 4n − 2 (as a consequence of the particular structure of its
                                            invariants due to the existence of the Pffafian). Another proof of this result was later
                                            obtained by Rowen using a direct method, but with some difficulties [20]. Finally in 1981
                                            [9], Kostant closed the subject once and for all by providing a very nice interpretation of
                                            the theorem in the context of representation theory and generalizing it using his separation
                                            of variables theorem [10]. To our knowledge, no one has returned to the Amitsur-Levitzki
                                            theorem since then.
                                               A few comments can be made about Kostant’s proofs of the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem.
                                            First, both proofs use the polynomial structure of the ring of invariants of a semi simple
                                            Lie algebra. Second, his cohomological proof is based on a quite sophisticated theorem
                                            of cohomology of Lie algebras (namely, the Hopf-Koszul-Samelson theorem, see e.g. [8])
                                            from which the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem is a consequence, modulo some combinatorial

identities concerning the trace [11]. We can give a more economical proof based on sim-
ilar arguments, but that does not rely on the Hopf-Koszul-Samelson theorem. Our proof
uses only elementary properties of the Chevalley-Cartan’s transgression operator [4, 3]
and some identities concerning the invariants Tr(X k ). It will not be presented in this paper;
however, a completely similar reasoning will allow us to handle the orthosymplectic case
osp(1, 2n).
    The goal of this paper is to study possible versions of the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem
in the case of Lie superalgebras. Consider the Lie super algebra gl(p, q) and define for
X1 , . . . , Xk ∈ gl(p, q):

                     Ak (X1 , . . . , Xk ) :=    ∑      ε (σ )ε (σ , X )Xσ (1) . . . Xσ (k)
                                                σ ∈Sk

where the super sign ε (σ , X ) will be defined in Section 1. The polynomial Ak is invariant
under the action of the super algebra gl(p, q). We call Ak the standard super polynomial
of order k and it clear that this polynomial is a natural candidate to replace Ik in the case
of the superalgebra gl(p, q). The next step is to check whether Ak is zero for k sufficiently
big. However, if pq 6= 0, one can easily see that this is not true: there always exists a non
nilpotent element X ∈ gl(p, q)1 and since Ak (X, . . . , X) = k!X k , it results that Ak 6= 0 for
all k. Therefore there is no standard super identity for gl(p, q). With this counter-example
in mind, one might think there is little hope in finding such an identity for the simple
subalgebras of gl(p, q).
    However, a closer look at the counter-example shows that it can be translated in terms of
invariants: the algebra of invariants of gl(p, q) is not finitely generated [21]. If we follow
the philosophy of Kostant’s proofs, the algebra of invariants of the considered Lie super-
algebra should be a polynomial algebra, which leaves us with a single choice: osp(1, 2n).
For this series of Lie superalgebras, the algebra of invariants is a polynomial algebra in n
variables by a theorem proved by V. Kac [15]. In addition, it is easy to see that all elements
in osp(1, 2n)1 are nilpotent (see Section 2), so the counter-example above does not apply.
    As a consequence, the series osp(1, 2n) seems to be a good candidate for an Amitsur-
Levitzki super theorem and our goal in this paper is to show that this super version does
exists. The main result presented here is the following:

    THEOREM: For X1 , . . . , X4n+2 ∈ osp(1, 2n), A4n+2 (X1 , . . . , X4n+2 ) = 0.

Notice that the number 4n + 2 appearing in the above theorem is precisely the one for
gl(2n + 1) in the classical case of the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem.
   As we mentioned before, the proof of this theorem follows the lines of Kostant’s coho-
mological proof, but in a simpler form. Our proof does not need to use a powerful theorem
such as Hopf-Koszul-Samelson’s for osp(1, 2n) (see [6]), but only elementary properties
of a (super) transgression operator and some identities concerning super traces.
   We believe that in general there is no super Amitsur-Levitzki theorem for the classical
Lie superalgebras, with exception made to the series osp(1, 2n). This can be explained by
the fact that their algebra of invariants is not (in general) finitely generated. Recall that
osp(1, 2n) are the only simple Lie superalgebras (together with simple Lie algebras) that
are also semi simple [5] (meaning complete reducibility of their finite-dimensional repre-
sentations). The fact that these Lie superalgebras satisfy an identity of Amitsur-Levitzki
type strengthens the impression that they are very close to simple Lie algebras. However,
the existence of a ghost center and of exotic primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra
[14, 15, 16] indicate that the analogy cannot be carried much further.
                                BACK TO THE AMITSUR-LEVITZKI THEOREM                                         3


   We want to stress that the present study was performed in the context of an invariant
theory for Lie superalgebras and in that spirit. It would of course be interesting to relate
our super identity with the general theory of PI-algebras (a very active domain, see e.g.
[2, 17, 20]) where the classical Amitsur-Levitzki theorem plays an important role. That
is a different study, which remains to be done since our super identity does not seem to
appear in the PI-algebras literature.

1.1. Algebras of supersymmetric and skew supersymmetric multilinear mappings.
Let V = V0 ⊕ V1 be a finite-dimensional Z2 -graded vector space. Considered elements
X ∈ V are supposed homogeneous, and we denote by a small x the degree. On W = C, set
W0 = C and W1 = {0}. Let F (V ) be the Z-graded space of multilinear forms on V and
F p (V ) the subspace of p-forms. Consider the natural Z2 -grading on F p (V ):
          F ∈ F p (V ), degZ2 (F) = f iff degZ2 (F(X1 , . . . , X p )) = x1 + · · · + x p + f
   The space F (V ) is endowed with the usual tensor product ⊗, and with a super tensor
product denoted by ⊗ and defined as :
                          s

        (F ⊗ G)(X1 , . . . , X p+q ) := (−1)g(x1 +...+x p ) F(X1 , . . . , X p )G(X p+1 , . . . , X p+q ),
            s
                                        p                q
   for X1 , . . . , X p+q ∈ V , F ∈ F f (V ), G ∈ Fg (V ) with degZ2 (F) = f and degZ2 (G) = g.
   Let X = (X1 , . . . , X p ) ∈ V p and σ an element of the symmetric group S p . Define:
                                            ε (σ , X ) := (−1)K(σ ,X )
   where K(σ , X ) := ♯{(i, j) | Xσ (i) , Xσ ( j) ∈ V1 , i < j and σ (i) > σ ( j)}. It follows from
the definition that ε (σ , X ) is a multiplier, that is:
                               ε (σ σ ′ , X ) = ε (σ , X )ε (σ ′ , σ −1 · X )
   with σ · X := (Xσ −1 (1) , . . . , Xσ −1 (p) ).
   We can consider three actions of S p on F p (V ):
                  σ · F(X1 , . . . , X p ) := F(Xσ (1) , . . . , Xσ (p) ),
                  σ · F(X1 , . . . , X p ) := ε (σ , X )F(Xσ (1) , . . . , Xσ (p) ),
                     s
                  σ · F(X1 , . . . , X p ) := ε (σ )ε (σ , X )F(Xσ (1) , . . . , Xσ (p)).

   We then say that a p-form F is supersymmetric if σ · F = F, ∀ σ ∈ S p and skew su-
                                                                            s
persymmetric if σ · F = F, ∀ σ ∈ S p . We denote by P(V ) the space of supersymmetric
                      a
forms and by A (V ) the space of skew supersymmetric forms.
   Now let S and A be two operators on F (V ) defined as:

                  S(F) :=      ∑       σ · F, A(F) :=
                                        s
                                                              ∑       σ · F, ∀ F ∈ F p (V ).
                                                                        a
                              σ ∈S p                         σ ∈S p
   We can then define a product on P(V ) and A (V ) as:
                                          1
                                F · G :=      S(F ⊗ G),
                                         p!q!     s

for F ∈ P p (V ), G ∈ P q (V ),
                                          1
                                F ∧ G :=      A(F ⊗ G),

for F ∈ A p (V ), G ∈ A q (V ).
   This gives an algebra structure on P(V ) and A (V ). The algebra P(V ) is Z2 -graded
(since V is Z2 -graded) and isomorphic to the (usual) tensor product Sym(V0∗ ) ⊗ Ext(V1∗ ).
The algebra A (V ) is double graded by Z × Z2 , and isomorphic to Ext(V0∗ ) ⊗ Sym(V1∗ ).
                                                                                                   Z×Z2
We have
                                            F · G = (−1) f g G · F
for F, G ∈ P(V ), degZ2 (F) = f , degZ2 (G) = g, and
                                        F ∧ G = (−1)nm+ f g G ∧ F,
for F, G ∈ A (V ), degZ×Z2 (F) = (n, f ), degZ×Z2 (G) = (m, g).
    These relations imply that P(V ) and A (V ) are supercommutative with respect to their
gradation. We can say that P(V ) (respectively A (V )) is the analogous of the algebra of
polynomial functions (respectively of the Grassman algebra) in the non graded case.
    The following formulae will be useful in this work: let φ1 , . . . , φ p ∈ V ∗ with Z2 -degrees
ϕ1 , . . . , ϕ p , ϕ := (ϕ1 , . . . , ϕ p ), then
                          φ1 · . . . · φ p = (−1)Ω(ϕ ,ϕ ) S(φ1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ φ p ) and

    For X ∈ V , define super derivations DX               and ι X of P(V ) and A (V ) respectively as:

for F ∈ A (V ), degZ×Z2 (F) = (p, f ).
   Hence, DX is a super derivation of degree x of P(V ) and ι X is a super derivation of
degree (−1, x) of A (V ).

   There exists a super derivation (also denoted by d) of A (V ) of degree (1, 0) extending
d: for F ∈ A (g),

        dF(X1 , . . . , Xn+1 ) := ∑ (−1)i+ j      (−1)xi (x1 +...+xi−1 ) (−1)x j (x1 +...+xbi +...+x j−1 )
                                 i< j

                                                   F([Xi , X j ], X1 , . . . , Xbi , . . . , Xbj , . . . , Xn+1 ).
    From the Jacobi identity, it comes d 2 = 0 and we can then define the cohomology (with
trivial coefficients) of g as:
                    Z(g) := Ker(d), B(g) := Im(d) and H(g) := Z(g)/B(g).
    Let {X1 , . . . , X p+q } be a basis of g and {φ1 , . . . , φ p+q } its dual basis. Define the forms φei
as φei (X) := (−1)xi x φi (X), X ∈ g. Thus, one has:

                                                  1 p+q e
(1.1)                                       d=      ∑ φi ∧ LaXi .
                                                  2 i=1
   It results from (1.1) that I a (g) ⊂ Z(g). Moreover, one has:
(1.2)                               LaX = ι X ◦ d + d ◦ ι X , ∀ X ∈ g.
   As a consequence, LaX commutes with d and LaX (Z(g)) ⊂ B(g).

                          2. O RTHOSYMPLECTIC L IE SUPERALGEBRAS
   In this section, let g be the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(1, 2n). Among simple
Lie superalgebras, the orthosymplectic osp(1, 2n) are the only ones (together with simple
Lie algebras) satisfying the remarkable property of being semi simple [5] , meaning that
every finite-dimensional representation is completely reducible.
2.1. The Weyl algebra and osp(1, 2n). In the quantization framework, the Lie superal-
gebra g can be realized as follows: let An be the Weyl algebra generated by {pi , qi , i =
1, . . . , n} with [pi , qi ]L = 1, ∀ i, [pi , q j ]L = [pi , p j ]L = [qi , q j ]L = 0, if i 6= j where [·, ·]L
denotes the Lie bracket. The algebra An is Z2 -graded, hence a Lie superalgebra. Denote
by [·, ·] its bracket.
Definition 2.1. The twisted adjoint action of An onto itself is defined as:
                                    ad′ A(B) := AB − (−1)a(b+1)BA
   for A, B ∈ An , degZ2 (A) = a, degZ2 (B) = b.
   Let V1 := span{pi , qi , i = 1, . . . , n} and h := V1 ⊕ [V1,V1 ]. Then h is a subalgebra of the
Lie superalgebra An . Let now V := V0 ⊕ V1 where V0 := C · 1. We have ad′ h(V ) ⊂ V .
Moreover the supersymmetric 2-form F(X,Y ) := [X,Y ]L , X,Y ∈ V1 and F(1, 1) := −2 is
ad′ h-invariant. It follows that h ≃ osp(1, 2n). An easy but remarkable consequence is the
following
Proposition 2.2. If X ∈ osp(1, 2n)1 , then X 3 = 0.
Proof. It is enough to show that if X ∈ V1 , then (ad′ X|V )3 = 0. Using (ad′ X)(1) = 2X and
(ad′ X)2 (Y ) = 2[X,Y ]L X, ∀ Y ∈ V1 , the result follows.                                
   More generally:

Proposition 2.3. Let π be a finite-dimensional representation of g = osp(1, 2n). If X ∈ g1 ,
then π (X) is nilpotent.
Proof. We use here the realization of g as h. Let X ∈ h1 = V1 , X 6= 0. There exists a
Darboux basis of V1 for the form F|V1 ×V1 such that X is the first basis element. We can
then suppose that X = p1 . Let l = l0 ⊕ l1 with l1 = span{p1 , q1 } and l0 = [l1 , l1 ]. So l ≃
osp(1, 2). Let ρ = π |l . Write ρ = ⊕i∈I ρi its decomposition into simple components. If
d0 = max{dim ρi , i ∈ I}, then π (p1 )d0 = 0.                                                 

2.2. Cohomology of osp(1, 2n). From [5], the representation La of g is completely re-
ducible. Using Koszul’ strategy in [12], this fact together with the results in Section 1.2, in
particular the equations (1.1) and (1.2), allows us to prove
Lemma 2.4. Every cohomology class of H(g) contains one and only one invariant cocycle.
In particular, 0 is the unique invariant coboundary and H(g) = I a (g).
   For the sake of completeness, we should mention that there exist better results concern-
ing H(g): Fuks and Leites [6] have announced that H(g) ≃ H(g0 ) = H(sp(2n)). However,
we shall not need these results here.

2.3. Invariants. Concerning I s (g), it results from V. Kac’s work that the Chevalley re-
striction theorem holds [15]: let h be a Cartan subalgebra of g0 and W the Weyl group,
then the restriction of I s (g) into Sym(h∗ )W is an algebra isomorphism. As a consequence,
I s (g) is a polynomial algebra in n variables. We will see later how to choose convenient
generators.

       3. C HEVALLEY ’ S TRANSGRESSION                OPERATOR FOR        L IE   SUPERALGEBRAS

   The transgression operator t : Sym(g∗ ) → Ext(g∗ ) was introduced by Chevalley ([4, 3],
see also [8]) and it is a fundamental tool in the theory of Lie algebras. In this section,
we shall generalize this notion to the case of Lie superalgebras and give some elementary
properties that will be useful in the sequel.
   Let g = g0 ⊕ g1 be a Lie superalgebra. Let {X1 , . . . , X p } be a basis of g0 , {Y1 , . . . ,Yq } a
basis of g1 , {Ω1 , . . . , Ω p } and {φ1 , . . . , φq } their respective dual basis. There exists a super
derivation R of P(g) of degree 0 extending Idg∗ :
                                              p              q
                                      R := ∑ Ωi DXi − ∑ φ j DY j
                                             i=1            j=1

    We have:
                                  R(P) = (degZ P) P,         ∀ P ∈ P(g)
    where degZ P comes from P(g) = Sym(g0 )⊗Ext(g1∗ ) and from the natural Z-gradations
                                                      ∗

of Sym(g∗0 ) and Ext(g1∗ ).
    There exists an algebra homomorphism s : P(g) → A (g) such that s(Ωi ) = dΩi , i =
1, . . . , p, and s(φ j ) = d φ j , j = 1, . . . , q (since the dΩi (i = 1, . . . , p) commute, the d φ j ( j =
1, . . . , q) anticommute and the dΩi , d φ j (i = 1, . . . , p, j = 1, . . . , q) commute).
    One can easily check that d(s(P)) = 0, ∀ P ∈ P(g). Besides, s is a homomorphism
of g-modules, if P(g) is endowed with the representation Ls and A (g) endowed with the
representation La . Therefore s(I s (g)) ⊂ I a (g).
    Following Chevalley, we now set:
                                  BACK TO THE AMITSUR-LEVITZKI THEOREM                        7


Definition 3.1. The transgression operator t : P(g) → A (g) is defined as
                             p                       q
(3.1)              t(P) := ∑ Ωi ∧ s(DXi (P)) − ∑ φ j ∧ s(DY j (P)), ∀ P ∈ P(g)
                            i=1                      j=1

   A priori, this definition seems to be basis dependent, but this is not the case as we shall
show below. For the time, let us state:
Lemma 3.2. One has d(t(P)) = s(R(P)), ∀ P ∈ P(g).
   Since R(P) = (degZ P) P, Lemma 3.2 shows that if P has no constant term, then s(P) is
a coboundary.
   Moreover t is an s-derivation:
Lemma 3.3. One has t(P · Q) = t(P) ∧ s(Q) + s(P) ∧ t(Q), for all P, Q ∈ P(g).
   In order to establish some other properties of the transgression, we need now an intrinsic
definition of t. First, observe that there is an isomorphism End(g) = g∗ ⊗ g given by:
                                                                            s

                       (Ω ⊗ X)(Y ) := (−1) Ω(Y ) X, ∀ Ω ∈ g , X,Y ∈ g.
                                                xy                 ∗
                             s
      Thanks to this identification, the representation π := ad
                                                              ˇ ⊗ ad becomes ad(ad ·) and Idg =
 p                q
∑ Ωi ⊗ Xi − ∑ φ j ⊗ Y j is π -invariant.
         s             s
i=1              j=1
      Now fix P ∈ P(g) and set τ p : End(g) → A (g) as

(3.2)                                 τP (Ω ⊗ X) := Ω ∧ s(DX (P))
                                            s
   It is immediate that τ p (Idg ) = t(P), so the definition of t in (3.1) is basis independent.
In addition, using the representation π on End(g) and La on A (g), one has
Lemma 3.4. If P ∈ I s (g), then τP : End(g) → A (g) is a g-module homomorphism.
      As a direct consequence of (3.2) and Lemma 3.4, we obtain:
(3.3)                                       t(I s (g)) ⊂ I a (g)
      Combining 3.3, 1.1 and Lemma 3.2, one has
Lemma 3.5. Let I+   s (g) be the subspace of I s (g) with no constant terms. Then for all
     s
P ∈ I+ (g), s(P) = 0.
      Finally applying Lemma 3.3, we conclude
                             s (g))2 , t(P) = 0.
Lemma 3.6. For all P ∈ C ⊕ (I+

             4. S TANDARD   SUPER POLYNOMIALS AND SUPER IDENTITIES IN            gl(p, q)
   In this section, V = V0 ⊕ V1 with dimV0 = p, dimV1 = q, and g is the Lie superalgebra
g = End(V ) ≃ gl(p, q).
   We identify End(V ) and V ⊗ V ∗ by using:
                             Z ⊗ Ω(T ) := Z.Ω(T ), ∀ Z, T ∈ V, Ω ∈ V ∗
      Then define the super trace on g as:
                            str(Z ⊗ Ω) := (−1)ω z Ω(Z), ∀ Z ∈ V, Ω ∈ V ∗

Remark 4.1. With this definition, the 2-form B(Z|T ) := str(ZT ) is supersymmetric and
non degenerate on g. In the case p = 1 and q = 2n, B|osp(1,2n) is non degenerate as well.
Definition 4.2. The standard supersymmetric super polynomials Pk (resp. skew super-
symmetric Ak ) are given by:
                      Pk (X1 , . . . , Xk )    :=      ∑     ε (σ ; X )Xσ (1) . . . Xσ (k) ,
                                                     σ ∈Sk

                       Ak (X1 , . . . , Xk )   :=      ∑     ε (σ )ε (σ ; X )Xσ (1) . . . Xσ (k) ,
                                                     σ ∈Sk

where k > 1, X1 , . . . , Xk ∈ g.
   The polynomials Pk and Ak are g-invariant k-linear maps from gk to g. They verify the
recursive relations below:
                                               k+1
(4.2a)        Pk+1 (X1 , . . . , Xk+1 ) =      ∑ (−1)x j (x1 +...+x j−1 ) X j .Pk (X1, . . . , Xbj , . . . , Xk+1 ),
                                               j=1

                                                        k+1
                   Ak+1 (X1 , . . . , Xk+1 ) =           ∑ (−1) j+1(−1)x j (x1 +...+x j−1 ) X j .
                                                         j=1

(4.2b)                                                  Ak (X1 , . . . , Xbj , . . . , Xk+1 ).
      From Pk and Ak , we can construct Pk ∈ I s (g) and Λk ∈ I a (g):
                                Pk (X1 , . . . , Xk ) := str(Pk (X1 , . . . , Xk )),
                                Λk (X1 , . . . , Xk ) := str(Ak (X1 , . . . , Xk ))
Proposition 4.3. One has:
(a)
                        P2k+1 (X1 , . . . , X2k+1 ) = (2k + 1)B(P2k (X1 , . . . , X2k )|X2k+1 ),
(4.4)                   Λ2k (X1 , . . . , X2k ) = 0,
                        Λ2k+1 (X1 , . . . , X2k+1 ) = (2k + 1)B(A2k (X1 , . . . , X2k )|X2k+1 ).
(b)
(4.5)         ∑       ε (σ )ε (σ ; X )[Xσ (1) , Xσ (2) ] . . . [Xσ (2k−1) , Xσ (2k) ] = 2k A2k (X1 , . . . , X2k )
             σ ∈S2k

(c)
                       ∑      ε (σ )ε (σ ; X )[Xσ (1) , Xσ (2) ] . . . [Xσ (2 j−1), Xσ (2 j) ]Xσ (2 j+1)
                  σ ∈S2k+1

                  [Xσ (2 j+2), Xσ (2 j+3)] . . . [Xσ (2k) , Xσ (2k+1) ] = 2k A2k+1 (X1 , . . . , X2k+1 )
(4.6)
Remark 4.4. The identities (4.4), (4.5) and (4.6) are super versions of classical identities
in the non graded case. Their proofs are simple adaptations to the super case. Other super
identities can be settled, but they will not be needed in this work.
   Let us examine what happens when we apply the transgression on the invariant Pk de-
fined by the super trace.
Theorem 4.5. One has t(Pk ) = (−1)k−1 kΛ2k−1 .

(notice that the products above are calculated in P(g)).
   From t(Mrs ) = Mrs , ∀ r, s and Lemma 3.3, it comes:

                    5. T HE A MITSUR L EVITZKI THEOREM FOR osp(1, 2n)
   Henceforth we will assume that g = osp(1, 2n) and e g = gl(1, 2n). We will now prove a
(super) version of the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem for g. In other words, we will show:
Theorem 5.1. For all X1 , . . . , X4n+2 ∈ g, we have A4n+2 (X1 , . . . , X4n+2 ) = 0.
   Notice that this identity is valid if X1 , . . . , X4n+2 ∈ g0 by the classical Amitsur-Levitzki
theorem. Furthermore, if X1 = · · · = X4n+2 = X ∈ g1 then by Proposition 2.2, the identity
holds as well.
   The theorem will be a consequence of Theorem 4.5 and two lemmas:
10                    PIERRE-ALEXANDRE GIÉ, GEORGES PINCZON, ROSANE USHIROBIRA


Lemma 5.2. One has:
   (1) For all X1 , . . . , X2p+1 ∈ g, P2p+1 (X1 , . . . , X2p+1) ∈ g.
   (2) For all X1 , . . . , X4p+1 ∈ g, A4p+1 (X1 , . . . , X4p+1 ) ∈ g.
   (3) For all X1 , . . . , X4p+2 ∈ g, A4p+2 (X1 , . . . , X4p+2 ) ∈ g.
    As a consequence, P2k+1, Λ4p+1 and Λ4p+2 vanish as multilinear mappings on g.
    Recall from Subsection 2.3 that the restriction R : I s (g) → J is an algebra isomor-
phism
       where J := Sym(h∗ )W .        The elements of h are the matrices H(α1 , α2 , . . . , αn ) =
   α1     0
 0 −α1                      0        
                                     
                .                    
                  ..                 , so one has Sym(h∗ ) = C[α1 , . . . , αn ] and the Weyl group
                                     
         0                 αn    0 
                             0 −αn
is generated by permutations and changes signs of α1 , . . . , αn . For these reasons, we can
write J = C[t1 , . . . ,tn ] where tk := ∑ki=1 αi2k for 1 ≤ k ≤ n. It is clear that tk ∈ J, ∀ k and
that tk ∈ J+2 if k ≥ n + 1 where J denotes the augmentation ideal. On the other hand,
                                        +
R(P2k ) = 2tk , therefore one deduces:
Lemma 5.3. One has I s (g) = C[P2 , P4 , . . . , P2n ] and P2n+2 ∈ (I+
                                                                     S (g))2 .

     We will next terminate the proof of Theorem 5.1.
Proof. (of Theorem 5.1) Let tg be the transgression defined on g and tge be transgres-
sion defined on e g. Since g is a subalgebra of e   g, if P is a p-form in P(e  g), one has
tge (P)|g = tg (P|g p ). In the sequel, we use t for both transgressions tg and tge , and we
         p

consider multilinear mappings restricted to g. Now, since P2n+2 ∈ (I+      s (g))2 , we have

t(P2n+2) = 0 from Lemma 3.6. Using Theorem 4.5, we deduce t(P2n+2) = −(2n + 2)Λ4n+3,
hence Λ4n+3 = 0. From Proposition 4.3, for all X1 , . . . , X4n+3 ∈ g,
                  Λ4n+3 (X1 , . . . , X4n+3 ) = (4n + 3)B(A4n+2(X1 , . . . , X4n+2 )|X4n+3 ).
     But A4n+2 (X1 , . . . , X4n+2 ) ∈ g by Lemma 5.2 (3), hence from Remark 4.1:
                         A4n+2 (X1 , . . . , X4n+2 ) = 0, for all X1 , . . . , X4n+2 ∈ g.
                                                                                                  
Remark 5.4. From (4.2b), we have Ak |gk = 0 if k ≥ 4n + 2. Also one can check that
A4n |g4n−1 ×g 6= 0 (thanks to Hopf-Koszul-Samelson theorem for g0 = sp(2n)). So the index
       0      1
obtained in Theorem 4.5 is the best possible, if one considers only even indices, a technical
but justified assumption (see [9]). As for A4n+1 |g4n+1 , it does not vanish if n = 1 et n = 2,
but the general case is still to be done.

  We wish to thank D. Sternheimer and the referees for suggestion of several improve-
ments to this paper.

   This article is dedicated to Moshe Flato (1937–1998). He introduced us to the Amitsur-
Levitzki theorem (among many other subjects). When Moshe was a first year student at the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Jakob Levitzki taught him algebra and (after his sudden
death in 1956) was replaced in the middle of the year by his assistant Shimshon Avraham
Amitsur, with whom Moshe considered for a while to work for a PhD before choosing

with insight in both fields. But above all he was a superb human being and a great friend.
