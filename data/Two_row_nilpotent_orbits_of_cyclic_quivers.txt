                                                                      ANTHONY HENDERSON

                                                   Abstract. We prove that the local intersection cohomology of
                                                   nilpotent orbit closures of cyclic quivers is trivial when the two
                                                   orbits involved correspond to partitions with at most two rows.
                                                   This gives a geometric proof of a result of Graham and Lehrer,
                                                   which states that standard modules of the affine Hecke algebra of
                                                   GLd corresponding to nilpotents with at most two Jordan blocks
                                                   are multiplicity-free.




                                                                        1. Introduction
                                               Let ∆n be the cyclic quiver with n vertices. The isomorphism classes
                                            of nilpotent complex representations of ∆n are in bijection with certain
                                            nilpotent orbits in a suitable variety (see §2 for the definition). The clo-
                                            sure of such a nilpotent orbit is usually singular, and it is an important
                                            problem to compute its local intersection cohomology at the points of
                                            another given orbit (see §3). If n = 1, these are the usual nilpotent
                                            orbits in gld , and the problem was solved by Lusztig in [6].
                                               The main result of this paper (Theorem 3.1 below) is that this local
                                            intersection cohomology is trivial when the two orbits involved corre-
                                            spond to partitions with at most two rows (equivalently, the represen-
                                            tations of ∆n involved are either indecomposable or the sum of two
                                            indecomposables).
                                               In §3 we discuss some equivalent formulations of this result. The
                                            most noteworthy concerns the complex representation theory of H          ed ,
                                            the affine Hecke algebra of GLd (C) (as defined in [4]). This algebra
                                            has geometrically-defined standard modules Ms,x,q0 indexed by triples
                                            (s, x, q0 ) where s ∈ GLd (C) is semisimple, x ∈ gld (C) is nilpotent,
                                            q0 ∈ C× , and
                                                                          Ad(s)(x) = q0 x.
                                            By a well-known result of Ginzburg, Theorem 3.1 (for n ≥ 2) is equiv-
                                            alent to the statement that Ms,x,q0 is multiplicity-free when q0 is a
                                            primitive n-th root of unity, all eigenvalues of s are powers of q0 , and x
                                            has at most two Jordan blocks. (See §3 for more on the equivalence.)
                                                                                   1
2                          ANTHONY HENDERSON

   This statement was recently proved by Graham and Lehrer in [2].
Actually, they imposed no conditions on s and q0 , but it is easy to
reduce to the above case. Their method is algebraic, making use of the
representation theory of the affine Temperley-Lieb algebras, and their
results apply over more general ground fields (with induced modules in-
stead of standard modules). The present paper arose from the author’s
desire to give a purely geometric/combinatorial proof of Theorem 3.1,
thus reproving Graham and Lehrer’s result (in the complex case).
   In §4 we introduce canonical resolutions of the nilpotent orbit clo-
sures, and derive a dimension formula for the orbits, which appears to
be new (see Lemma 4.1). We also discuss how to determine the local
intersection cohomology, given the Poincaré polynomials of the fibres
of these resolutions. Then for the remainder of the paper we restrict
attention to the nilpotent orbits with at most two rows. Section 5 con-
tains some preliminary Lemmas, and Section 6 completely describes
the closure relations among such orbits. Section 7 presents the proof
of Theorem 3.1.
   Our notation for partitions and Young diagrams follows [8]. In par-
ticular, if λ is a partition, its nonzero parts are λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λℓ(λ) ,
where ℓ(λ) is the length; and λ′ denotes the transpose partition.

              2. Nilpotent Orbits of Cyclic Quivers
   Fix   a positive integer n. Let ∆n be the cyclic quiver of type A]n−1 ,
which    has vertex set I = Z/nZ and an arrow from i to i − 1 for all
i ∈ I.   Let V = ⊕i∈I Vi be an I-graded vector space over C. We write
di for   dimPVi , d for the dimension vector dim V = (di )i∈I , and d for
dim V    = i∈I di . Let
                                M
                           EV =     Hom(Vi , Vi−1 )
                                i∈I

be the space of representations of ∆n on V . Two representations
                                                           Q          in
EV are isomorphic iff they are in the same orbit of GV = i∈I GL(Vi ),
acting on EV by conjugation.
   We say that x ∈ EV , and its GV -orbit, are nilpotent if x is nilpo-
tent as an element of End(V ). Let NV be the subvariety of nilpotent
elements of EV . The nilpotent GL(V )-orbits in End(V ) are in bijec-
tion with Λ(d), the set of partitions of size d: let Oλ denote the orbit
corresponding to the partition λ. The GV -orbits in NV have a similar
description, as follows.
           TWO-ROW NILPOTENT ORBITS OF CYCLIC QUIVERS                       3

   The isomorphism classes of indecomposable nilpotent representa-
tions of ∆n are called segments. There is a segment [i; l) for each i ∈ I
and l ∈ Z+ ; in our convention this is the isoclass of indecomposables
of length l whose socle is the simple module corresponding to i. The
notation is meant to suggest the multiset {i, i + 1, · · · , i + l − 1}, which
(regarded as a function I → N) is precisely the dimension vector of an
indecomposable representation in this class. Since any representation
is a direct sum of indecomposables, the nilpotent representations are
parametrized by multisegments (multisets of segments), which we write
with direct sum notation, e.g. [i1 ; l1 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ [is ; ls ).
   Collecting together all segments [i; l) with the same i, we can think
of a multisegment as an I-tuple of partitions λ = (λ(i) )i∈I . Let   ` Λ be
the set of such I-tuples, and for λ ∈ Λ, write λ for the union i∈I λ(i) .
We will identify λ with the corresponding I-labelled Young diagram
of shape λ. This is the unique I-labelled Young diagram in which the
labels from left to right across a row increase by 1 at each step, and λ(i)
is the subpartition formed by all rows starting with the label i. (Two
I-labelled Young diagrams which differ by permuting rows of equal
length are considered the same.)
Example 2.1. Suppose n = 3. Consider the multisegment
                  [2; 2) ⊕ [0; 2) ⊕ [1; 4) ⊕ [1; 1) ⊕ [0; 2).
The corresponding λ has λ(0) = (22 ), λ(1) = (41), and λ(2) = (2). So
                                          1      201

                      λ = (42 1), and λ = 0      1   .

                                          1
  The dimension vector of a nilpotent representation in the class cor-
responding to λ is d(λ) = (di (λ))i∈I , where di (λ) is the number of
boxes labelled i. Consequently, the GV -orbits in NV are in bijection
with Λ(d) = {λ ∈ Λ | d(λ) = d}. For λ ∈ Λ(d), write Oλ for the
corresponding orbit. In other words,
                 Oλ = {x ∈ NV | dim ker xk = d(λ≤k )},
where λ≤k is obtained from λ by deleting all but the first k columns.
Clearly the GL(V )-orbit containing Oλ is Oλ .
  We define a partial order ≤ on Λ(d) by
                           µ ≤ λ ⇔ Oµ ⊆ Oλ.
We will be mainly interested in the sub-poset Λ≤2 (d) of Λ(d) con-
sisting of all λ with at most two rows. The corresponding nilpotent
4                        ANTHONY HENDERSON

representations are either indecomposable or the sum of two indecom-
posables; as elements of End(V ), they have at most two Jordan blocks.
Obviously µ ∈ Λ≤2 (d), µ ≤ λ ⇒ λ ∈ Λ≤2 (d).
Remark 2.2. All of the above remains true for the linear quiver of
type A∞ , if we take I = Z. In this case Λ≤2 (d) has at most 2 elements,
of which the maximal one parametrizes the orbit which is dense in
NV = EV . As we will see, Λ≤2 (d) is more interesting for ∆n , but still
much simpler to describe than the whole poset Λ(d).

              3. Local Intersection Cohomology
   For λ ∈ Λ(d), let Hk IC(Oλ) be the k-th intersection cohomology
sheaf of the (usually singular) variety Oλ. As we will see, this vanishes
if k is odd. If µ ≤ λ, let the local IC polynomial K̃λ,µ(t) ∈ N[t] be
                               X
                   K̃λ,µ(t) =      dim Hx2kµ IC(Oλ) tk ,
                               k≥0

where Hx2kµ IC(Oλ) means the stalk at some point xµ ∈ Oµ. Trivially
we have K̃λ,λ(t) = 1 for all λ. By basic properties of intersection
cohomology, K̃λ,µ(t) has constant term 1 and satisfies
(3.1)           deg K̃λ,µ < (codim Oλ Oµ)/2, if µ < λ.
If µ  λ, we set K̃λ,µ(t) = 0. The main result of this paper is:
Theorem 3.1. For λ ≥ µ in Λ≤2 (d), K̃λ,µ(t) = 1.
In other words, for λ ≥ µ in Λ≤2 (d), Oλ is rationally smooth at the
points of Oµ (in general, it is not actually smooth there).
  If n = 1, Λ(d) = Λ(d) and Oλ = Oλ . Lusztig proved in [6] that
                     K̃λ,µ (t) = tn(µ)−n(λ) Kλ,µ (t−1 ),
                                                           P
where Kλ,µ (·) is the Kostka-Foulkes polynomial and n(λ) = (k−1)λk .
So in this case Theorem 3.1 is well known.
   Several important results involve the polynomials K̃λ,µ(t), which is
why one wants to compute them. In [7, §11] Lusztig showed that the
orbit closures Oλ could be embedded as open subvarieties of certain
affine Schubert varieties of type A, which explains why Hk IC(Oλ) = 0
for k odd. It also means that there is an order-preserving injection
                         Λ(d) ֒→ W̃ : λ 7→ wλ,
where W̃ is the affine Weyl group of type A ]d−1 , such that K̃λ,µ(t) is
the affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial Pwµ ,wλ (t). (This gives a combi-
natorial algorithm for computing K̃λ,µ(t) in general, but it is a highly
          TWO-ROW NILPOTENT ORBITS OF CYCLIC QUIVERS                    5

impractical one.) So Theorem 3.1 assserts that certain very special
affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials are trivial. One can also interpret
(K̃λ,µ(t)) as the transition matrix between two bases of the generic Hall
algebra of ∆n , an algebra of great importance in the theory of quantum
affine sln (see for instance [5, §3]). We will not say anything further
about either of these points of view.
   There are also well-known interpretations of (some of) the values
K̃λ,µ(1) in complex representation theory. In the case n = 1, K̃λ,µ (1)
is the Kostka number Kλ,µ , which gives the multiplicity of the simple
representation Vλ of the symmetric group Sd in the induced representa-
tion IndSSdµ ×Sµ ×···×Sµ (C). So in this case Theorem 3.1 asserts that an
          1    2     ℓ(µ)

induced representation of the form IndSSdµ ×Sµ (C) is multiplicity-free,
                                          1   2
which is again well known.
   If on the other hand n ≥ 2, let ζ ∈ C× be a primitive n-th root of
unity. Let s ∈ GL(V ) be the semisimple element which acts by the
scalar ζ −i on Vi . Then EV = {x ∈ End(V ) | Ad(s)(x) = ζx}. Thus for
any x ∈ NV , we have an associated standard module Ms,x,ζ of H  ed , the
affine Hecke algebra of GLd (C) mentioned in the Introduction. Up to
isomorphism, this depends only on the GV -orbit of x, so we will write
it as Mλ for λ ∈ Λ(d).
   Let Lλ be the quotient of Mλ defined in [1, Chapter 8], which is
either 0 or a simple module. We say that λ ∈ Λ(d) is aperiodic if
for all m there exists some i ∈ I such that m is not a part of λ(i) .
It follows from results of Lusztig that Lλ 6= 0 iff λ is aperiodic (see
[5, §2 and Appendix]). All simple constituents of Mµ for µ ∈ Λ(d)
are isomorphic to some such nonzero Lλ, and we have the following
multiplicity formula due to Ginzburg ([1, Theorem 8.6.15], [5, §2]):
                            [Mµ : Lλ] = K̃λ,µ(1).
So Theorem 3.1 implies that if µ ∈ Λ≤2 (d), Mµ is multiplicity-free. In
fact, this is equivalent to Theorem 3.1 (for n ≥ 2), since an element of
Λ≤2 (d) must be aperiodic, unless n = 2, all di are equal, and it is the
minimal element of Λ≤2 (d). As mentioned in the Introduction, this
equivalent formulation is part of the main result of [2]. Thus Theorem
3.1 has already been proved representation-theoretically; we will prove
it geometrically in the course of subsequent sections.

              4. Resolutions of the Orbit Closures
  The key to our approach is the fact that each orbit closure Oλ has
an obvious resolution of singularities. Fix λ ∈ Λ(d). Let l = ℓ(λ′ )
be the number of columns of λ. Recall that λ≤k ∈ Λ is obtained by
6                         ANTHONY HENDERSON

deleting all but the first k columns of λ. Define the I-graded partial
flag variety
    Fλ = {0 = W (0) ⊂ W (1) ⊂ · · · ⊂ W (l) = V | dim W (k) = d(λ≤k )},
and let
    f = {(x, (W (k) )) ∈ N × F | x(W (k) ) ⊆ W (k−1) , 1 ≤ k ≤ l}.
    O λ                   V   λ

In the case n = 1, this is the cotangent bundle of Fλ = Fλ . In general
we have:

                                    i∈I

      So if µ ≤ λ, codim Oλ Oµ = ǫ(µ) − ǫ(λ).
Proof. (1) is obvious, because Fλ is the product of partial flag varieties
in each V of the required dimension. Clearly O   f → F is a vector

This is the number of ordered pairs of boxes (b, b′ ) in λ where the
column containing b′ is further right than the column containing b, and
the label of b′ is one more than the label of b. Considering the box b′′
immediately to the left of b′ , we see that this is the same as the number
of ordered pairs of boxes (b, b′′ ) with the same label where the column
containing b′′ is further right than or equal to the column containing b,
and where b′′ is not at the end of a row. This gives (2). For (3), pλ is
proper since Fλ is projective. From the definitions,
   p−1
    λ (Oλ) = {(x, (W
                     (k)
                         )) ∈ NV × Fλ | ker xk = W (k) , 1 ≤ k ≤ l},

which is clearly open in O f and isomorphic to O . The rest follows

since we know from (1) and (2) that Oλ is smooth and irreducible.
              P      2
   Note that    i∈I di = dim GV . So (3) implies that for xλ ∈ Oλ,
dim ZGV (xλ) = ǫ(λ). (Thus the notation agrees with [5, §3].) Since
ZGV (xλ) is an open subvariety of the algebra of endomorphisms of xλ
as a representation of ∆n , it is connected. So the only GV -equivariant
simple perverse sheaves on NV are the shifted intersection cohomol-
ogy complexes IC(Oλ)[dim Oλ], for λ ∈ Λ(d). By the Equivariant
Decomposition Theorem (see for example [1, Theorem 8.4.7]),

                                   j∈Z

for some aλ,ν,j ∈ N. Since the left-hand side is Verdier self-dual,
aλ,ν,j = aλ,ν,−j . Since pλ is an isomorphism over Oλ, aλ,λ,j is 1 if
j = 0 and 0 otherwise.
   Taking stalk at xµ ∈ Oµ of both sides of (4.1), we get
                                                           !

         λ (xµ) = {(W

It is easy to prove (say by induction on l) that p−1
                                                  λ (xµ ) has a paving

use below we will see this another way.) So in fact aλ,ν,j = 0 if j is of

                               and if we write gλ,µ(t) for the Poincaré
polynomial k≥0 dim H (pλ (xµ)) tk , we have
                                                              

                    λ≥ν≥µ     j≡ǫ(ν)−ǫ(λ) mod 2

Thanks to the degree constraint and others we have mentioned, know-
ing gλ,µ(t) for all λ ≥ µ determines all aλ,µ,j and K̃λ,µ(t). In fact:
Lemma 4.2. If bλ,µ,j ∈ C and Lλ,µ(t) ∈ C[t] for all λ ≥ µ ∈ Λ(d)
and j ∈ Z satisfy:
  1. for all λ ≥ µ,
                                                        
                X        X
    gλ,µ(t) =                   bλ,ν,j t(ǫ(ν)−ǫ(λ)−j)/2  Lν,µ(t),
                  λ≥ν≥µ     j≡ǫ(ν)−ǫ(λ) mod 2

    2.   bλ,λ,j = δj,0 ,
    3.   bλ,µ,j = bλ,µ,−j ,
    4.   bλ,µ,j = 0 if j is of opposite parity to ǫ(µ) − ǫ(λ),
    5.   Lλ,λ(t) = 1, and
    6.   deg Lλ,µ < (ǫ(µ) − ǫ(λ))/2 for µ < λ,
then bλ,µ,j = aλ,µ,j , Lλ,µ(t) = K̃λ,µ(t) for all λ ≥ µ, j ∈ Z.
Proof. We know that bλ,µ,j = aλ,µ,j , Lλ,µ(t) = K̃λ,µ(t) is a solution of
(1)–(6). We now give an algorithm to determine bλ,µ,j and Lλ,µ(t) from
(1)–(6), assuming that all gλ,µ(t) are known, thus showing that this is
the unique solution. This algorithm is by induction on ǫ(µ) − ǫ(λ).
If this is 0, µ = λ, and bλ,λ,j and Lλ,λ(t) are determined by (2) and
(5) respectively. Otherwise, we can apply the induction hypothesis to
λ > ν and ν > µ, and hence assume that all terms in the right-hand
side of (1) have been determined except ν = λ and ν = µ. So we know
the value of
                             X
              Lλ,µ(t) +                bλ,µ,j t(ǫ(µ)−ǫ(λ)−j)/2 .
                            j≡ǫ(µ)−ǫ(λ) mod 2

Because of (6), this determines bλ,µ,j for j ≤ 0, j ≡ ǫ(µ) − ǫ(λ) mod 2,
hence for all j by (3) and (4). Thus Lλ,µ(t) also is determined.
The argument of this proof is familiar in other contexts, for instance
in the study of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.
Remark 4.3. Note that if we want to determine a specific polynomial
K̃λ,µ(t) by this method, we only need to know gρ,ν (t) for those ρ, ν such
that λ ≥ ρ ≥ ν ≥ µ; that is, we can restrict attention to the interval
           TWO-ROW NILPOTENT ORBITS OF CYCLIC QUIVERS                         9

[µ, λ] ⊆ Λ(d). In particular, in proving Theorem 3.1 we can restrict
attention to Λ≤2 (d). In the remaining sections, we will calculate gλ,µ(t)
for λ ≥ µ in Λ≤2 (d) and show that it has the required form.


Remark 4.4. Note that in the case n = 1, pλ : O    f → O is semismall ;
                                                    λ      λ
equivalently, aλ,ν,j = 0 if j 6= 0. For example, p(d) is the famous
Springer resolution of the nilpotent cone. The Poincaré polynomial
gλ,µ (t) is the generalized Hall polynomial g µ λ′    λ′
                                                         (t), the function
                                                 (1 l ),··· ,(1   1)

ǫ(λ) is 2n(λ)+d, and the nonzero coefficient aλ,ν,0 is the Kostka number
Kν ′ ,λ′ (see [8, III.6, Example 5]). This can be proved geometrically,
using Fourier transform (see [3, §5]). When n ≥ 2, Fourier transform
does not seem to be useful for analysing R(pλ)∗ C.

Remark 4.5. An example when pλ is not semismall is the case n = 2,
λ = [0; 4) ⊕ [0; 1). If µ = [0; 2) ⊕ [0; 2) ⊕ [0; 1), the reader can check
that aλ,µ,1 = aλ,µ,−1 = 1.

Remark 4.6. When n = 2, it is easy to see that
                                  (d0 − d1 )2 + ǫ(λ)
                         ǫ(λ) =                      ,
                                          2
whence dim Oλ = 21 dim Oλ . This is well known, since the orbits Oλ
are the nilpotent orbits of the symmetric pair (gld , gld0 ⊕ gld1 ).

Remark 4.7. When n ≥ 3, it is not true in general that ǫ(λ) only
depends on d and λ. (Consider n = 3, d0 = 2, d1 = d2 = 1, λ = (212).)
However, it is still true that µ ≤ λ, µ = λ ⇒ µ = λ. This can be seen
by interpreting Oλ as the image of pλ.


                        5. Preliminary Lemmas
   Now we restrict attention to λ ∈ Λ≤2 (d) and the corresponding
nilpotent orbits. It is convenient to return to multisegment notation,
and write elements of Λ≤2 (d) as [i1 ; l1 )⊕[i2 ; l2 ) where l2 is possibly zero
(by convention [i; 0) is the empty partition). For any m ∈ Z, write {m}
for the unique element of {0, 1, · · · , n − 1} ∩ (m + nZ). So
                     m    m − {m} m     m + {−m}
                 ⌊     ⌋=        , ⌈ ⌉=          .

Lemma 5.1. Let λ = [i1 ; l1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; l2 ), where the factors are ordered so
that l1 ≥ l2 . Then
                       l1    l2       l2 − {i1 − i2 + l1 − 1}
               ǫ(λ) = ⌈ ⌉ + ⌈ ⌉ + ⌈                           ⌉

                          +⌈                  ⌉.
                                   n
Proof. This is trivial from the definition of ǫ.
     Fix λ = [i1 ; l1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; l2 ), with l1 ≥ l2 ≥ 0. Let
                 Λ≤2 (d)≤λ = {µ ∈ Λ≤2 (d) | µ ≤ λ},
                       i1 ,i2
                Λ≤2 (d)≤λ     = {µ = [i1 ; m1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; m2 ) | µ ≤ λ}.

                                         i1 ,i2
Lemma 5.2. If l2 ≥ 1, Λ≤2 (d)≤λ = Λ≤2 (d)≤λ     . If l2 = 0,
                               [         i1 ,i2
                   Λ≤2 (d)≤λ =    Λ≤2 (d)≤λ     ,
                                             i2

and the union is disjoint except for λ.
Proof. If l2 ≥ 1, we have dim ker x = {i1 , i2 } for any x ∈ Oλ, where
{i1 , i2 } is considered as a multiset, and hence dim ker x ≥ {i1 , i2 } for
any x ∈ Oλ. Thus if µ ≤ λ and µ ∈ Λ≤2 (d), µ must be [i1 ; m1 ) ⊕
[i2 ; m2 ) for some m1 , m2 ∈ N. If l2 = 0, we know only that for x ∈ Oλ,
dim ker x ≥ {i1 }. But if µ < λ and µ ∈ Λ≤2 (d), µ must have two
rows, so there is a unique i2 such that µ = [i1 ; m1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; m2 ).

                                                        i1 ,i2
Lemma 5.3. Suppose µ = [i1 ; m1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; m2 ) ∈ Λ≤2 (d)≤λ     . Then
                        m1 + m2 = l1 + l2 , l1 ≥ m1 ≥ l2 ,
and either
               (a) m1 ≡ l1 , m2 ≡ l2 mod n; or
               (b) m1 ≡ i2 − i1 + l2 , m2 ≡ i1 − i2 + l1 mod n.
(It is possible that (a) and (b) both hold.)
Proof. That m1 + m2 = d = l1 + l2 is obvious. Since Oµ ⊆ Oλ, we
must have Oµ ⊆ Oλ , which implies that l1 ≥ m1 ≥ l2 . Finally,
                  d([i1 ; m1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; m2 )) = d([i1 ; l1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; l2 )).
Subtracting d([i1 ; m1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; l2 )) from both sides, we get
                 d([i2 + l2 ; m2 − l2 )) = d([i1 + m1 ; l1 − m1 )).
This clearly implies either (a) or (b).

   It will be easier to get a converse to this Lemma after we describe
the fibres p−1  λ (xµ ). For s1 , s2 ∈ N, let B(s1 ,s2 ) be the Springer fibre
p−1
 (s1 +s2 ) (s1 )⊕(s2 ) ), a special case of this fibre when n = 1. (The choices
          (x
of the vector space of dimension s1 + s2 and the element x(s1 )⊕(s2 ) ∈
O(s1 )⊕(s2 ) are unimportant.)
Lemma 5.4. Let µ = [i1 ; m1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; m2 ) 6= λ, where m1 and m2 satisfy
the conditions in Lemma 5.3. Then p−1          ∼
                                       λ (xµ ) = B(s1 ,s2 ) , where

                        m1 − l2 − {i2 − i1 }           m2 − l2
               s1 = ⌊                        ⌋, s2 = ⌊         ⌋,
                                n                        n
so that
                            l1 − l2 − {i2 − i1 } − {i1 − i2 + l1 − l2 }
          s1 + s2 = s :=                                                .
                                                 n
(We declare B(−1,s2 )    to be empty.)
Proof. By definition,
      p−1     ∼       (k)
                          ) ∈ Fλ | xµ(W (k) ) ⊆ W (k−1) , 1 ≤ k ≤ l1 }.
       λ (xµ) = {(W

It is clear that for 1 ≤ k ≤ l2 , W (k) is forced to be ker xkµ. Hence
p−1      ∼ −1
 λ (xµ) = pλ′ (xµ′ ) where

    λ′ = [i1 + l2 ; l1 − l2 ), µ′ = [i1 + l2 ; m1 − l2 ) ⊕ [i2 + l2 ; m2 − l2 ).
Since λ 6= µ, m2 − l2 > 0. In this new fibre, if i1 6= i2 , W (1) is
forced to be (ker xµ′ )i1 +l2 . Passing to the quotient space and repeating,
we see that W (k) is uniquely determined for 1 ≤ k ≤ {i2 − i1 }, so
p−1
 λ′
    (xµ′ ) ∼
           = p−1
              λ′′
                  (xµ′′ ) where
             λ′′ = [i2 + l2 ; l1 − l2 − {i2 − i1 }),
            µ′′ = [i2 + l2 ; m1 − l2 − {i2 − i1 }) ⊕ [i2 + l2 ; m2 − l2 ).
(If any lengths become negative here we understand that the corre-
sponding fibre is empty.)
   We now wish to apply the dual argument, so note that the end box
of λ′′ is labelled i1 + l1 − 1, and the end labels of µ′′ are i1 + l1 − 1
and i2 + l2 − 1 in some order. If i1 + l1 6= i2 + l2 , W (l1 −l2 −{i2 −i1 }−1) is
forced to be the preimage of (cokerxµ′′ )i2 +l2 −1 . Hence W (l1 −l2 −{i2 −i1 }−k)
is unique for 1 ≤ k ≤ {l1 − l2 + i1 − i2 }, so p−1
                                                λ′′
                                                    (xµ′′ ) ∼
                                                            = p−1
                                                               λ′′′
                                                                    (xµ′′′ ), where
 λ′′′ = [i2 + l2 ; l1 − l2 − {i2 − i1 } − {l1 − l2 + i1 − i2 }) = [i2 + l2 ; ns),
and µ′′′ is obtained from µ′′ by deleting the last {l1 − l2 + i1 − i2 } boxes
of the row whose end label is i1 + l1 − 1. This is the first row if (a)
holds and the second row if (b) holds; if both hold, there are no boxes
to be deleted. In either case, µ′′′ = [i2 + l2 ; ns1 ) ⊕ [i2 + l2 ; ns2 ).
12                            ANTHONY HENDERSON

     So in the end it suffices to show that
                     p−1                                   ∼
                      [i;n(s1 +s2 )) (x[i;ns1 )⊕[i;ns2 ) ) = B(s1 ,s2 ) .

This is obvious, since each I-graded flag in the left-hand side is uniquely
determined by the induced flag in the subspace corresponding to i.

Example 5.5. To illustrate this proof, here is an example of the se-
quence of steps when n = 3 (the boxes with bold borders are the ones
to be removed):

Corollary 5.6. Let µ = [i1 ; m1 ) ⊕ [i2 ; m2 ). Then µ ∈ Λ≤2 (d)≤λ     if
and only if
                m1 + m2 = l1 + l2 , l1 ≥ m1 ≥ l2 + {i2 − i1 },
and either (a) or (b) holds.
Proof. We know from Lemma 4.1 that Oλ is the image of pλ, so µ ≤ λ
iff p−1
     λ (xµ ) is nonempty. Lemma 5.4 shows that for m1 , m2 as in Lemma
5.3, p−1
      λ (xµ) is empty if and only if (a) holds and m1 −l2 < {i2 −i1 }.


Corollary 5.7. For µ < λ, p−1 λ (xµ) has no odd cohomologies, and

where s1 , s2 and s are as in Lemma 5.4.
Proof. Springer fibres such as B(s1 ,s2 ) have no odd cohomologies. The
                                             (s ,s )
right-hand side is the Green polynomial Q(11s ) 2 (t), which is well known

                    6. Description of the Posets
    Maintain the notations of §5. In particular, λ = [i1 ; l1 )⊕[i2 ; l2 ) where
l1 ≥ l2 ≥ 0; and s is as in Lemma 5.4. Using Corollary 5.6, we can
                                            i1 ,i2
completely describe the poset Λ≤2 (d)≤λ             and hence the poset Λ≤2 (d)
as a whole. The arguments are trivial applications of the Lemmas in
§5, and are mostly left to the reader. There are four cases.
    Case 1: i1 = i2 = i, l1 ≡ l2 mod n.
In this case conditions (a) and (b) coincide, and s = l1 −l    n
                                                                 2
                                                                   . If l1 − l2 = 0
                                        ≤2      i,i
or n, λ is the unique element of Λ (d)≤λ, and conversely. Otherwise,
[i; l1 − n) ⊕ [i; l2 + n) is a predecessor of λ, also in Case 1. So Λ≤2 (d)i,i   ≤λ
is a chain:




                             [i; l1 ) ⊕ [i; l2 )              (s, 0)
                                      
                                      
                                      y
                       [i; l1 − n) ⊕ [i; l2 + n)           (s − 1, 1)
                                   
                                   
                                   y
                                     :
                                     
                                     
                                     y
                   [i; l1 − ⌊ 2s ⌋n) ⊕ [i; l2 + ⌊ 2s ⌋n)   (⌈ 2s ⌉, ⌊ 2s ⌋)




Here and in subsequent diagrams µ → ν means that ν is a predecessor
of µ, and the boldface labels are the values of (s1 , s2 ) as in Lemma 5.4
(whose order is actually not determined in the case that i1 = i2 ). It is
easy to see from Lemma 5.1 that ǫ([i; l1 − n) ⊕ [i; l2 + n)) = ǫ(λ) − 2.
So the codimension at each link of the chain is 2. There are ⌊ 2s ⌋ links.
   Case 2: i1 = i2 = i, l1 6≡ l2 mod n.
Here conditions (a) and (b) are mutually exclusive, and s = ⌊ l1 −l     n
                                                                          2
                                                                            ⌋. It
                                                       ≤2    i,i
is easy to see that λ is the unique element of Λ (d)≤λ if and only if
l1 −l2 < n; otherwise, [i; l1 −{l1 −l2 }) ⊕[i; l2 + {l1 −l2 }) is a predecessor
of λ, also in Case 2, and satisfying condition (b). Again, Λ≤2 (d)i,i      ≤λ is

a chain:




                               [i; l1 ) ⊕ [i; l2 )                  (s, 0)

                         [i; l1 − n) ⊕ [i; l2 + n)               (s − 1, 1)

                                     
                                     y
                    [i; l1 − n − {l1 − l2 }) ⊕ [i; · · · )       (s − 1, 1)
                                    
                                    
                                    y
                                       :
                                       
                                       
                                       y
                  [i; l1 − ⌊ 2s ⌋n − {l1 − l2 }) ⊕ [i; · · · )   (⌈ 2s ⌉, ⌊ 2s ⌋)




(To make this and later diagrams legible, some row lengths are omitted;
recall that for every element the sum of the lengths is l1 + l2 .) If s is
even, the minimal element is actually the same as the element which
might be thought to be directly above it, namely [i; l1 − 2s n)⊕[i; l2 + 2s n).
So there are always s links in the chain. This time the codimension at
each link is 1.
   Case 3: i1 6= i2 , l1 − l2 ≡ i2 − i1 mod n.
In this case conditions (a) and (b) coincide, and s = ⌊ l1 −l         n
                                                                        2

condition for λ to be the only element of Λ (d)≤λ is that l1 − l2 =

{i2 −i1 }. Otherwise, [i2 ; l1 −{l1 −l2 })⊕[i1 ; l2 +{l1 −l2 }) is a predecessor
of λ, also in Case 3. The summands here are in the right order, i.e.

If s is even, the minimal element here is also [i1 ; l1 − 2s n) ⊕ [i2 ; l2 + 2s n),
so there are always s links in the chain. Again the codimension at each
link is 1.
    Case 4: i1 6= i2 , l1 − l2 6≡ i2 − i1 mod n.

l1 − l2 < {i2 − i1 }, λ is the unique element of Λ≤2 (d)≤λ               , and con-

If s is even, the bottom two elements coincide and are minimal. If s is
odd, there is one more element below these two, namely
                               s                  s                       s    s

So the length of a maximal chain in this poset is s + 1. Again, all
predecessors have codimension 1.

cial (relative to λ) if there is no element ν of [µ, λ] with k(ν) = k(µ)
                                                 s        s
except µ itself. If µ is special, let cλ,µ = k(µ)   − k(µ)−1   . Otherwise,
let cλ,µ = 0. We can now prove a stronger version of Theorem 3.1:
Theorem 7.1. If λ ≥ µ in Λ≤2 (d), then K̃λ,µ(t) = 1, aλ,µ,j = 0 if
j 6= 0, and aλ,µ,0 = cλ,µ.
Proof. By inspection of the diagrams in the previous section, we see
that if µ is special, then ǫ(µ)−ǫ(λ) = 2k(µ). Moreover, for all positive
k ′ ≤ k(µ), there is a unique special ν ∈ [µ, λ] such that k(ν) = k ′ . So
Corollary 5.7 can be rephrased:
                                X
                      gλ,µ(t) =      cλ,ν t(ǫ(ν)−ǫ(λ))/2 .
                                λ≥ν≥µ

Now we apply Lemma 4.2 (bearing in mind Remark 4.3) with bλ,µ,j =
δj,0cλ,µ and Lλ,µ(t) = 1. The result follows.
