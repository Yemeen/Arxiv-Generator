                                                    Abstract. The description of irreducible finite dimensional representations of finite di-
                                                    mensional solvable Lie superalgebras over complex numbers given by V. Kac is refined. In
                                                    reality these representations are not just induced from a polarization but twisted, as infinite
                                                    dimensional representations of solvable Lie algebras. Various cases of irreducibility (general
                                                    and of type Q) are classified.

                                                Hereafter the ground field is C and all the modules and superalgebras are finite dimen-

                                                A description of irreducible representations of solvable Lie superalgebras given in [K]
                                             (Theorem 7) contains an error. In reality to give such a description one has to imitate the
                                             description of infinite dimensional solvable Lie algebras [D], i.e., we must consider twisted
                                             induced representations. In what follows I give a correct description of irreducible represen-
                                             tations of solvable Lie superalgebras. I also show where a mistake crept into [K] and give a
                                             counterexample to Theorem 7 from [K].
                                                The proof given in what follows was delivered at Leites’ Seminar on Supermanifolds in 1983
                                             and is preprinted in [L] in a form considerably edited by I. Shchepochkina and D. Leites. My

                                             It is convenient to represent the functionals from L as elements of an isomorphic space
                                                                                        L0 = (g0̄ /[g0̄ , g0̄ ])∗ .
                                             The natural isomorphism of these spaces is given by the formula
                                                                            ′

                                             representation of the Lie algebra g0̄ determined by the character λ. Every functional λ ∈ L
                                             determines a symmetric form fλ on g1̄ by the formula
                                                                                      fλ (ξ1 , ξ2 ) = λ([ξ1 , ξ2 ]).
                                             A subalgebra h ⊂ g is called a polarization for λ ∈ L (and is often denoted by p(λ)) if

Lemma . For every λ ∈ L there exists a polarization h.
  If h is a polarization for λ ∈ L, then, clearly, λ determines a (1, 0)-dimensional represen-
tation of h.
1.2. Twisted representations. Let h ⊂ g be a Lie subsuperalgebra that contains g0̄ .
Define a functional θh ∈ L by setting
                                     1
                                        str (ad g) for g ∈ g0̄
                             θh(g) = 2 g/h
                                            0      for g ∈ g1̄
Note that θh([h, h]) = 0 by definition of the supertrace. Therefore, θh is a character of a
(1, 0)-dimensional representation of h.
  Let h be a polarization for λ ∈ L. Define the twisted (by the character θh) induced and
coinduced representations by setting
                         Ihg(λ) = Indgh(λ + θh) = U(g) ⊗U (h) (λ + θh);
                      CIhg(λ) = Coindgh(λ − θh) = HomU (h) (U(g), λ − θh).

Lemma . 1) Ihg(λ) is finite dimensional and irreducible.
  2) Ihg(λ) does not depend on the choice of a polarization h; therefore, notation I(λ) (= Ihg(λ)
for some h) is well-defined.
  3) CI(λ) ∼ = I(λ).
1.3. Main Theorem. Let Z = {(λ, h) : λ ∈ L and let h be a polarization for λ}. Define
an equivalence relation on Z by setting
                              (λ, h) ∼ (µ, t) ⇐⇒ λ − θh = µ − θt
Clearly, this relation is well-defined.
  Recall ([BL]) that the representation of a Lie superalgebra g is called irreducible of G-
type if it has no invariant subspaces; it is called irreducible of Q-type if it has no invariant
subsuperspaces.
Theorem . 1) Every irreducible finite dimensional representation of g is isomorphic up to
application of the change of parity functor Π to a representation of the form I(λ) for some
λ.
   2) The map λ −→ I(λ) is (up to Π) a 1-1 correspondence between elements of L and the
irreducible finite dimensional representations of g.
   3) Let (λ, h), (µ, t) ∈ Z. Then Indgh(λ) ∼    g
                                            = Indt (µ) if and only if (λ, h) ∼ (µ, t).
   4) If rkfλ is even, then I(λ) is a G-type representation; if rkfλ is odd, then I(λ) is a
Q-type representation.

                 §2. Prerequisites for the proof of Main theorem
   Let k ⊂ g be a subsuperalgebra, codim k = ε, and µ the character of the representation of
g0̄ in g/k. For the definition of the isomorphism ′ see sec. 1.1.
2.1. Lemma . µ′ is a character of g.
Proof. Let ξ ∈ g and ξ 6∈ k. Since in g/k there is a k-action that coincides with µ′ |k, it
suffices to prove that µ′ ([k, ξ]) = µ′ ([ξ, ξ]) = 0. By the Jacobi identity [[ξ, ξ], ξ] = 0 which
proves that µ′ ([ξ, ξ]) = 0. Since p(µ) = 0̄, we have µ([ξ, ξ]) = 0. Let η ∈ k1̄ . Then
[[η, ξ], ξ] = 21 [η, [ξ, ξ]] ∈ k and, therefore, µ([k1̄ , ξ]) = 0.

2.2. Corollary . Let g0̄ ⊂ h ⊂ k ⊂ g so that dim k/h = ε. Let λ be the weight of a vector
in the g0̄ -module g/h. Then λ′ is a character of k.

2.3. Corollary . ([K]). A Lie superalgebra g = g0̄ ⊕ g1̄ is solvable if and only if so is g0̄ .

2.4. Corollary . If h is a polarization for λ, then h is also polarization for λ + αθh for any
α ∈ C∗ .
  Let us recall three well-known lemmas.
2.5. Lemma . (see [K]). Let g = k ⊕ Span(g), where k is a Lie subalgebra and p(g) = 1̄. If
(V, ρ) is an irreducible representation of k in a superspace V , then W = Indgk(V ) is reducible
if and only if V admits a g-module structure that extends ρ.

2.6. Lemma . (see [K]). Let k ⊂ g be a Lie subsuperalgebra, dim g/k = (0, 1). If W is an
irreducible g-module and V ⊂ W is an irreducible proper k-submodule, then W = Indgk(V ).

2.7. Lemma . Let W be a finite dimensional g-module, f a symmetric g-invariant form
on W and V a g-invariant isotropic subspace. Then there exists a maximal g-invariant
f -isotropic subspace in W containing V .
  Proof follows from linear algebra.
2.8. Corollary . Lemma 1.1 holds.
                        §3. Description of irreducible modules
3.1. Proposition . Let λ ∈ L, let h = g0̄ ⊕ p be a polarization for λ, n the kernel of fλ
and F ⊂ p a subspace such that p = F ⊕ n, ξ0 ∈ p⊥ and ξ0 6∈ p (if rk fλ is even, then we set
ξ0 = 0), v a generator of Indgk(λ). If u ∈ Indgk(λ) and F u = 0, then u ∈ Span(v, ξ0 v).
   Proof is carried out by induction on rk fλ . If rk fλ = 0, then F = 0 and the statement
is obvious.
   Let rk fλ > 0. Select a subalgebra h ⊃ b such that and dim g1̄ /h1̄ = 1. The two cases are
possible: h⊥                 ⊥
             1̄ 6⊂ h1̄ and h1̄ ⊂ h1̄ .
       ⊥
   i) h1̄ 6⊂ h1̄ . Then g1̄ = h1̄ ⊕ Span(ξ), where ξ ⊥ h1̄ . Hence, ξ ⊥ b1̄ and ξ 6∈ b1̄ . Therefore,
we may assume that ξ = ξ0 and rk fλ is an odd number. Clearly, b is a polarization for the
restriction fλ′ onto h1̄ and rk fλ′ is an even number. Further on,
                                 Indgb(λ) = Indhb(λ) ⊕ ξ0 Indgb(λ).
  Let u = u0 + ξ0 u1 ∈ Indgb(λ) and pu = 0 for any p ∈ F . Then
                                0 = pu = pu0 + [p, ξ0]u1 − ξ0 pu1 ,
therefore, pu1 = 0. By induction, u1 ∈ Span(v), where v is the generator of Indgb(λ). Since
ξ0 ⊥ b1̄ , it follows that [p, ξ0 ]u1 = fλ (p, ξ0 )u1 = 0. Therefore, pu0 = 0 and u0 ∈ Span(v).
Hence, u ∈ Span(v, ξ0v).
   Let us show now that the weight of ξ0 v with respect to g0̄ is also equal to λ. Indeed, since
[x, ξ0 ] ⊥ b1̄ for any x ∈ g0̄ , it follows that [x, ξ0 ] = µ(x)ξ0 + p for some p ∈ b1̄ . Furthermore,
[x, [ξ0 , ξ0] = 2[[x, ξ0 ], ξ0 ]; hence,
                            0 = λ([x, [ξ0 , ξ0 ]) = 2λ([µ(x)ξ0 + p, ξ0 ]) =
                            2µ(x)λ([ξ0 , ξ0]) + 2λ([p, ξ0 ]) = 2µ(x).
So, µ(x) = 0 and the weight of ξ0 v is equal to λ.

  ii) h⊥
       1̄ ⊂ h1̄ . Then the restriction of the form fλ onto h1̄ is of rank by 2 less than that of
fλ itself.
  Select ξ ⊥ h1̄ , η ∈ h⊥
                        1̄ and F1 ⊂ b1̄ so that
                           F = F1 ⊕ Span(η); ξ ⊥ F1 ; fλ (ξ, η) 6= 0.
Let
         u = u0 + ξu1 , where u ∈ Indgb(λ), u0 , u1 ∈ Indhb(λ) and pu = 0 for any p ∈ F.
Then
                                  0 = pu = pu0 + [p, ξ]u1 + ξpu1 ,
hence, pu1 = 0 and by induction u1 ∈ Span(v, ξ0v). Thanks to i) [p, ξ]u1 = fλ (p, ξ)u1 and
if p ∈ F1 , then fλ (p, ξ)u1 = 0; hence, pu0 = 0 for any p ∈ F1 . By induction we deduce that
u0 ∈ Span(v, ξ0v). Further,
                          0 = ηu = ηu0 + ηξu1 = [η, ξ]u1 = fλ (η, ξ)u1
and since fλ (η, ξ) 6= 0, then u1 = 0 and u = u0 ∈ Span(v, ξ0v).
3.2. Corollary . If h = g0̄ ⊕p is a polarization for λ, then Indgh(λ) is an irreducible module.
  Proof Irreducibility is equivalent to the absence of singular vectors that do not lie in
Span(v, ξ0 v)).
3.3. Corollary . heading 1) of Lemma 1.2 holds.
    Proof follows from the definition of Ihg(λ) and sect. 2.4.
3.4. Corollary . Let U be an irreducible finite dimensional g-module. Then U = Indgh(λ)
for some λ ∈ L and a polarization h.
   Proof will be carried out by induction on dim g1̄ . If g = g0̄ , then this is Lie’s theorem.
Let k ⊂ g and dim g1̄ /k1̄ = 1.
   Let U be irreducible as a k-module. Then there exist λ ∈ L and a polarization h ⊂ k for
λ ∈ L such that U = Indkh(λ). If h were a polarization for λ in g, too, then by Corollary 3.2
the representation
                                   Indgh(λ) = Indgk(Indkh(λ))
would have been irreducible contradicting Lemma 2.5.
   Let ĥ ⊃ h be a polarization for λ in g and ξ ∈ ĥ so that ξ 6∈ h. If v is a generator of
Indkh(λ) and p ∈ h1̄ , then
                                 pξv = [p, ξ]v = fλ (p, ξ)v = 0,
                                      1          1
                                ξξv = [ξ, ξ]v = fλ (ξ, ξ)v = 0.
                                      2          2
Therefore, there exists a non-zero g-module homomorphism Indgĥλ −→ Indk̂h(λ) = U and
since both modules are irreducible, this is an “odd isomorphism”, i.e., the composition of an
isomorpism with the change of parity.
   Now let U be reducible as a k-module. Then by Lemma 2.6 U = IndgkV , and, by induction,
V = Indkh(λ) for a polarization h ⊂ k and λ ∈ L. If h is not a polarization for λ in
g, then let ĥ ⊃ h be a polarization. We have a non-zero g-module homomorphism U =
Indgh(λ) −→ Indgĥ(λ) and since both modules are irreducible, this is an isomorphism which is
impossible because dim Indgĥ(λ) < dim Indgh(λ). Therefore, h is a polarization for λ in g and
U = Indgh(λ).
3.5. Corollary . Heading 1) of Theorem holds.

3.6. A subsuperalgebra subordinate for l ∈ L. Recall, see [K], that if
                          gl = {g ∈ g | l([g, g1]) = 0 for all g1 ∈ g},
then a subalgebra p ⊂ g is called subordinate to λ if l([p, p]) = 0 and p ⊃ gl .
Corollary . Let l ∈ L, b a subalgebra subordinate to l. Then Indgb(l) is irreducible if and
only if b is a polarization for l.

                         §4. Classification of modules Indgh(λ)
4.1. Lemma . If (λ, h) ∼ (µ, t), then h is a polarization for µ.
Proof. By 2.4 h is a polarization for λ − θh. Since λ − θh = µ − θt, then h is a polarization
for µ − θt and since t is a polarization for µ − θt, it follows that dim h = dim t. Let n be the
kernel of fµ−θt . Then h ∩ t ⊃ g0̄ ⊕ n and, therefore, g/b is a quotient of g1̄ /n; hence by sect.
2.2 we have θt([h, h]) = 0.
   Therefore, h is completely isotropic with respect to fµ and since dim h = dim t, we see
that h is a polarization for µ.
4.2. Proof of heading 3) of Theorem. Let (λ, h) ∼ (µ, t). We will carry the proof out
by induction on k = dim h/(h ∩ t). If k = 0 the statement is obvious. Let k = 1, then,
obviously, dim t/(h ∩ t) = 1. Consider the space h + t. By Lemma 4.1 t is a polarization for
λ and, therefore, the kernel of fλ on the subspace h + t is equal to h ∩ t. Let ξ ∈ h and η ∈ t
be such that ξ¯ ∈ h/(h ∩ t), ξ¯ 6= 0 and η̄ ∈ t/(h ∩ t), η̄ 6= 0. We may assume that fλ (ξ, η) = 1.
  Let v be a generator of Indgh(λ). Then for r ∈ h ∩ t we have
                                                         1       1
                 rηv = [r, η]v = λ([r, η])v = 0, ηηv = [η, η]v = λ([η, η])v = 0,
                                                         2       2
i.e., t1̄ (ηv) = 0 and, therefore, there exists a non-zero homomorphism Indgt(µ′ ) −→ Indgh(λ),
where µ′ is the weight of ηv.
   Since Indgh(λ) is irreducible and dim Indgt(µ′ ) = dim Indgh(λ), this homomorphism is an
isomorphism. Let g ∈ g0̄ . Then
                        g(ηv) = η(gv) + [g, η]v = [λ + trt/(t∩h) ad g]ηv,
i.e., µ′ = λ − strt/(t∩h) adg.
   Since λ ∈ L, it follows that
                        0 = λ([g, [ξ, η]]) = λ([[g, ξ], η]) + λ([ξ, [g, η]]) =
                            = −(strt/t∩had g + strh/t∩had g)λ([ξ, η]).
Since λ([ξ, η] = 1, it follows that
                                  strt/t∩had g = −strh/t∩had g,
and µ′ = λ − θb − θt, i.e., Indgt(µ)∼        g
                                    = π(Indt (λ)).
  Let k > 1. Let h = g0̄ + P and t = g0̄ ⊕ Q such that P ∩ Q ⊂ F ⊂ P , F 6= P and
F 6= P ∩ Q, where F is a g0̄ -submodule in g1̄ . Set R = F + (F ⊥ ∩ Q). It is not difficult to
verify that r = g0̄ ⊕ R is a polarization for λ. Set
                                  ν(x) = λ(x) + strP/(P ∩R) (ad x).
Since P/(P ∩ R) is a subquotient in g1̄ /n, it follows that ν([R, R]) = 0. The same arguments
as in Lemma 4.1 show that r is a polarization for ν.
  Since P ∩ R ⊃ F ⊃ P ∩ Q, then dim R/(P ∩ R) < dim P/(P ∩ Q).

    Further, the diagram of inclusions
                                         P 
                                           ∩ R −→ 
                                                  P

                                           y      y
                                           R   −→ g1̄
shows that
                  2θh(x) + strP/(P    ∩ R) ad   (x) = 2θr(x) + strR/(R   ∩ P ) ad   (x).
By duality, there exists a pairing
                                (P/(P ∩ R)) × (R/(P ∩ R)) −→ C
and since strP/(P ∩ R) ad(x) = −strR/(P ∩ R) ad (x), then strR/(P ∩ R) ad(x) = θh(x) − θr(x).
   Thus,
                ν(x) − θr(x) = λ(x) − strR/(P ∩ R) ad(x) − θR (x) = λ(x) − θh(x),
i.e., (λ, h) ∼ (ν, t) and, by induction, Indgh(λ) = Indgr(ν). Besides, ν − θr = λ − θh = µ − θt
and Q ∩ R ⊃ F ⊥ ∩ Q <⊃ Q ∩ P ; therefore,
                           dim Q/Q ∩ R ≤ dim Q̄ = dim Q/(Q ∩ P ).
By induction,   Indgr(ν) ∼    g                    g         g
                         = Indt (µ), therefore, Indh(λ) = Indt (µ).
   Conversely,  let Indgh(λ) ∼      g
                             = Indt (µ). Then λ = µ + α1 + . . .  + αk , where the αi are the
weights of g1̄ /Q. Therefore, by sect. 2.2 λ([Q, Q]) = 0 and since dim Indgh(λ) = dim Indgt(µ),
it folows that dim h = dim t and h is a polarization for λ and for µ′ = λ − θh + θt, too.
Since µ′ − θt = λ − θh, then by the above Indgt(µ′) = Indgh(λ) = Indgt(µ). Let v ′ ∈ Indgt(µ′ )
be a generator of Indgt(µ′ ) and Qv = 0. By 4.1 v ′ ∈ Span(v, ξ0 v), therefore, µ′ = µ and
(µ, t) ∼ (λ, h).
4.3. Corollary . Heading 2) of Theorem and heading 2) of Lemma 1.2 hold.
Proof. Due to sect. 2.4 it is clear that h is a polarization for λ + θh and, therefore, Ihg(λ) is
irreducible. If t is another polarization for λ, then by sect. 4.2
                         Itg(λ) = Indgt(λ + θt) = Indgh(λ + θh) = Ihg(λ).
If U is irreducible, then by sect. 3.4 U ∼     g
                                          = Vh (λ) for some λ and h.
   If I(λ) = I(µ), then Indgh(λ + θh) ∼      g
                                       = Indt (µ + θt) and by sect. 4.2
                               λ = λ + θh − θb = µ + θt − θt = µ.
   Proof of heading 3) of Lemma 1.2 Let us prove now that Ibg(λ) ∼             g
                                                                          = CIb (λ). To this end,
make use of the isomorphisms (Ib (λ))∗ ∼
                                   g
                                           = CIb (−λ) and (Ib (λ))∗ ∼
                                               g                g         g
                                                                       = Ib (−λ + 2θb). The first
of these isomorphisms follows from the definitions of the induced and coinduced modules.
   Let us prove the other one. Select a basis ξ1 , . . . , ξn in the complement to b1̄ in g1̄ and
consider the following filtration of Ibg(λ):
                I0 = Span(v) ⊂ I1 = Span(v; ξ1 v, . . . , ξn v) ⊂ · · · ⊂ In = Ibg(λ).
It is clear that the elements ξ can be chosen so that each Ik is a g0̄ -module. Let l ∈ (Ibg(λ))∗
be such that l(In ) 6= 0 while l(In−1 ) = 0. Then it is easy to verify that b1̄ l = 0 and the weight
l with respect to g0̄ is equal to −λ + 2θb. Therefore, there exists a nonzero homomorphism
ϕ : Ibg(−λ + 2θb) −→ (Ibg(λ))∗ .
   Since the dimensions of these modules are equal and the first of them is irreducible, ϕ is
an isomorphism. Hence,
              CI(λ) = CI g(λ − θb) ∼
                           b
                                           g                 g
                                       = (I (−λ + θb))∗ = I (λ − θb + 2θb) = I(λ).

                                          §5. An example
  Set g0̄ = Span(x, y, z, u), g1 = Span(ξ−2 , ξ−1 , ξ1 , ξ2) and let the nonzero brackets be:
                           [ξ−1 , ξ1 ] = u, [ξ−2 , ξ2 ] = u, [ξ1 , ξ2 ] = y

                                 [y, ξ−2] = − ξ−2 , [y, ξ2] = ξ1

                                  [z, ξ1 ] = ξ−2 , [z, ξ2 ] = − ξ1
                                             2                    2
                     [x, y] = −y, [x, z] = z, [x, ξ−1 ] = ξ−1 , [x, ξ1 ] = −ξ1 .
   It is not difficult to verify that g = g0̄ ⊕ g1̄ is a Lie superalgebra. It is solvable since
so is g0̄ . Consider λ = λ1 u∗ + λ2 x∗ with λ1 6= 0. Then h = g0̄ ⊕ Span(ξ−1 , ξ−2) and
t = g0̄ ⊕ Span(ξ1 , ξ2 ) are polarizations for λ. As is easy to verify, Ihg(λ) 6∼  g
                                                                                = It (λ); besides, the
weights of the module Indgh(λ) are λ, λ − x∗ , hence, λ − (λ − x∗ ) = x∗ but x∗ ([g1̄ , g1̄ ]) 6= 0
contradicting the statement of Theorem 7 of [K].
   The error in the proof of Theorem 7 of [K] is not easy to find: it is an incorrect induction
in the proof of heading a) on p. 80. Namely, if, in notations of [K], the subalgebra H is of
codimension (0, 1) then the irreducible quotients of W considered as G0 -modules belong by
inductive hypothesis to one class from L/LH     0 , where

                                   LH         ∗
                                    0 = {λ ∈ g : λ([H, H]) = 0},
NOT to one class from L/LG
                         0 as stated on p. 80, line 13 from below.
