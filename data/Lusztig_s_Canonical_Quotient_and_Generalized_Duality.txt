                                                    Abstract. We give a new characterization of Lusztig’s canonical quotient, a finite group
                                                    attached to each special nilpotent orbit of a complex semisimple Lie algebra. This group
                                                    plays an important role in the classification of unipotent representations of finite groups
                                                    of Lie type.
                                                       We also define a duality map. To each pair of a nilpotent orbit and a conjugacy class
                                                    in its fundamental group, the map assigns a nilpotent orbit in the Langlands dual Lie
                                                    algebra. This map is surjective and is related to a map introduced by Lusztig (and studied
                                                    by Spaltenstein). When the conjugacy class is trivial, our duality map is just the one
                                                    studied by Spaltenstein and by Barbasch and Vogan which has image consisting of the
                                                    special nilpotent orbits.




                                                                                      1. Introduction
                                                 To each special nilpotent orbit in a simple Lie algebra over the complex numbers, Lusztig
                                             has assigned a finite group (called Lusztig’s canonical quotient) which is naturally a quotient
                                             of the fundamental group of the orbit. This group is defined using the Springer correspon-
                                             dence and the generic degrees of Hecke algebra representations; it plays an important role
                                             in Lusztig’s work on parametrizing unipotent representations of a finite group of Lie type
                                             [L2].
                                                 In this paper we give a description of the canonical quotient which uses the description of
                                             the component group of a nilpotent element given in [So2] when G is of adjoint type. To do
                                             this we assign to each conjugacy class in the component group a numerical value (called the
                                             b̃-value). The definition of the b̃-value makes use of the duality map of [Sp] and involves the
                                             dimension of a Springer fiber; it is related to the usual b-value of a Springer representation
                                             (the smallest degree in which the representation appears in the harmonic polynomials on
                                             the Cartan subalgebra). Our observation is that the kernel of the quotient map from the
                                             component group to the canonical quotient consists of all conjugacy classes whose b̃-value
                                             is equal to the b̃-value of the trivial conjugacy class.
                                                 In the second part of the paper we define a surjective map from the set of pairs consisting
                                             of a nilpotent orbit and a conjugacy class in its fundamental group to the set of nilpotent
                                             orbits in the Langlands dual Lie algebra. This extends the duality of [Sp] (which corresponds
                                             to the situation when the conjugacy class is trivial). In fact the map depends only on
                                             the image of the conjugacy class in Lusztig’s canonical quotient. Our map is defined by
                                             combining the duality of [Sp] and a map defined by Lusztig [L2]. Lusztig’s map can be
                                             thought of as a generalization of induction [LuSp]; in his book, Spaltenstein also studied
                                             this generalization of induction [Sp].

                                      2. Basic set-up
   Throughout the paper, G is a connected simple algebraic group over the complex numbers
C. In G we fix a maximal torus T contained in a Borel subgroup B. Let the character
group of T be X ∗ (T ). We use g for the Lie algebra of G. Let Φ be the roots of G and let
W = NG (T )/T be the Weyl group of G (with respect to T ).
   The group G acts on g via the adjoint action. If e ∈ g is an element of g, we denote by
Oe the orbit of g through e under the action of G. If e is a nilpotent element, we call Oe a
nilpotent orbit.
   We denote by No the set of nilpotent orbits in g. This set is partially ordered by the
relation Oe  Of whenever Ōe ⊂ Ōf .
   For O ∈ No and e ∈ O, let A(e) be the component group ZG (e)/ZG    0 (e). If e, e′ ∈ O, then
                                ′
A(e) may be identified with A(e ) and so we write A(O) for this finite group. Furthermore,
we may speak in a well-defined manner of the conjugacy classes of A(O). When G is simply-
connected (and we pass to the analytic topology), A(O) is just the fundamental group of O.
We denote by Â(O) the irreducible representations of A(O) and use the notion of irreducible
local system on O interchangeably with the notion of irreducible representation of A(O),
or A(e) for any e ∈ O.
   We denote by No,c the set of pairs (O, C) consisting of an orbit O ∈ No and a conjugacy
class C ⊂ A(O). The set of special orbits in No (see [L1]) will be denoted by Nosp . There
is an order-reversing duality map d : No → Nosp studied by Spaltenstein such that d2 is the
identity on Nosp [Sp]. This map is already implicit in [L1], so we refer to d henceforth as
Lusztig-Spaltenstein duality.

                               3. Notation on partitions
   In the classical groups it will be helpful to have a description of the elements of No
and No,c and the map d in terms of partitions. We introduce that notation now (roughly
following the references [CM], [Ca], and [Sp]).
   Let P(m) denote the set of partitions λ = [λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λk ] of m (we assume that λk 6= 0).
For a part λi of λ, we call i the position of λi in λ. For λ ∈ P(m), let ri = #{j | λj = i}.
For ǫ ∈ {0, 1} let Pǫ (m) be the set of partitions λ of m such that ri ≡ 0 whenever i ≡ ǫ (all
congruences are modulo 2).
   It is well known that No is in bijection with P(n + 1) when g is of type An ; with P1 (2n)
when g is of type Cn ; with P0 (2n + 1) when g is of type Bn ; and with P0 (2n) when g is
of type Dn , except that those partitions with all even parts correspond to two orbits in
No (called the very even orbits). In what follows we will never have a need to address
separately the very even orbits, so we will not bother to introduce notation to distinguish
between very even orbits.
   We will also refer to P1 (2n) as PC (2n); to P0 (2n + 1) as PB (2n + 1); and to P0 (2n) as
PD (2n).

   The set P(m) is partially ordered by the usual partial ordering on partitions. This induces
a partial ordering on the sets PC (2n), PB (2n + 1), and PD (2n) and these partial orderings
coincide with the partial ordering on nilpotent orbits given by inclusion of closures. We
will refer to nilpotent orbits and partitions interchangeable in the classical groups (with the
caveat mentioned earlier for the very even orbits in type D).
   We can also represent elements of No,c in terms of partitions in the classical groups (see
the last section of [So2]). Given (O, C) ∈ No,c let e ∈ O and let s ∈ ZG (e) be a semisimple
element whose image in A(e) ∼   = A(O) belongs to C. Set l = Zg(s). We may as well assume
that l contains Lie(T ); then the subalgebra l of g (which we called a pseudo-Levi subalgebra
in [So2]) corresponds to a proper subset of the extended Dynkin diagram of g. It is always
possible to choose s so that l has semisimple rank equal to g, which we will do. Next we
write l = l1 ⊕ l2 , where l2 is a semisimple subalgebra of the same type as g and l1 is a
simple Lie algebra (or possibly zero) which contains the root space corresponding to the
lowest root of g (the extra node in the extended Dynkin diagram). Then l1 (if non-zero)
is of type D, C, or D depending on whether g is of type B, C, or D, respectively. Write
e = e1 + e2 where e1 ∈ l1 and e2 ∈ l2 . Finally, we may modify the choice of s so that e1
is a distinguished nilpotent element in l1 . Then we can attach to (O, C) ∈ No,c a pair of
partitions (ν, η) where ν is the partition of e1 in l1 and η is the partition of e2 in l2 . We
have
                        ν ∈ PD (2k), η ∈ PB (2n + 1 − 2k) in type Bn
(1)                   ν ∈ PC (2k), η ∈ PC (2n − 2k)                    in type Cn
                      ν ∈ PD (2k), η ∈ PD (2n − 2k)                    in type Dn
where 0 ≤ k ≤ n and ν is a distinguished partition, meaning ri ≤ 1 for all i (this necessarily
forces ri = 0 whenever i ≡ ǫ). The partition λ of O is just the partition consisting of all the
parts in ν and η. We denote this partition by ν ∪ η and write λ = ν ∪ η. In types C and D
we make the further assumption that the largest i 6≡ ǫ with ri ≡ 1 is not a part of ν. These
assumptions guarantee that when G is of adjoint type there is a bijection between No,c and
the pairs (ν, η) specified above (if O is very even in type D, the component group A(O) is
trivial when G is adjoint; so there are no additional complications beyond the one mentioned
earlier). We note that ν will be the empty partition (that is, k = 0 in equation (1)) if and
only if C is the trivial conjugacy class.
   For example, let O be the orbit with partition [5, 3, 1] in B4 . Then we have
                        (∅, [5, 3, 1]), ([3, 1], [5]), ([5, 1], [3]), ([5, 3], [1])
are the four elements of No,c corresponding to the four conjugacy classes of A(O) when G
is of adjoint type, with the first pair corresponding to the trivial conjugacy class.
   The dual partition of λ ∈ P(m), denoted λ∗ , is defined by λ∗i = #{j | λj ≥ i}. Let
X = B, C, or D. We define the X-collapse of a partition λ ∈ P(m) where m is even when
X = C or D and m is odd when X = B. The X-collapse of λ ∈ P(m) is the partition
µ ∈ PX (m) such that µ  λ and such that µ′  µ whenever µ′ ∈ PX (m) and µ′  λ. The
X-collapse of λ is denoted λX . It is well-defined and unique.
   The duality map d : No → Nosp can now be expressed as follows in the classical groups.
In type A, we have d(λ) = λ∗ and in type X (for X = B, C, D) we have d(λ) = (λ∗ )X . The
set of special nilpotent orbits correspond to the partitions in the image of d (in type D all
4                                            ERIC SOMMERS

very even orbits are special). Hence in type A all nilpotent orbits are special. In the other
types it is known that λ is special if and only if
                                  λ∗ ∈ PB (2n + 1) in type Bn
(2)                               λ∗ ∈ PC (2n) in type Cn
                                  λ∗ ∈ PC (2n) in type Dn .


                                             4. b̃-value
    In this section we assign to each pair (O, C) ∈ No,c a natural number which we will call
the b̃-value of (O, C) and which will be denoted by b̃(O,C) .
    Given (O, C) ∈ No,c let e ∈ O and s ∈ ZG (e) be a semisimple element whose image in
A(e) ∼ = A(O) belongs to C. The group L = ZG (s) has as its Lie algebra l = Zg(s) and
clearly e ∈ l.
    Let Oel denote the orbit in l through e under the action of L. Applying Lusztig-
Spaltenstein duality dl with respect to l, we obtain the orbit Ofl = dl(Oel ) ⊂ l. We define
b̃(O,C) = 12 (dim(l) − dim(Ofl ) − dim(T )). Equivalently, if Bfl is the variety of Borel subalge-
bras of l which contain f , then b̃(O,C) = dim Bfl . We have the following proposition whose
proof we give after the proof of proposition 7.
Proposition 1. The number b̃(O,C) is well-defined. In other words, it is independent of the
choices made for s and e.
    By results in [So2] it is always possible to choose s so that e is distinguished in l = Zg(s).
By the previous proposition, in order to compute b̃(O,C) it is enough to determine a pair
(l, e) attached to (O, C) where e is distinguished in l (this is done in [So2]) and to compute
the b̃-value of e with respect to l (with the trivial conjugacy class 1 of A(e)). Hence it
suffices to compute b̃(O,1) for each distinguished orbit O in each simple Lie algebra.
    We now record b̃(O,1) for the distinguished orbits in the exceptional groups.

    We now record b̃(O,1) for the distinguished orbits in the classical groups. In fact, it is no
harder to record the formula for b̃(O,1) for any orbit O, whether distinguished or not. Let

Remark 2. If O is the Richardson orbit for the parabolic subgroup P whose Levi subgroup
has root system isomorphic to A1 × · · · × A1 (s-times), we have observed that b̃(O,1) =
N − s mn+1−s . Here, n is the rank of G, N is the number of positive roots of G, and mi
is the i-th exponent of G when the exponents are listed in increasing order. This offers the
hope that there is a way to determine the b̃-value of any distinguished orbit from standard
data arising purely from the root system.
   The next proposition is analogous to a statement (due to Lusztig in [L2]) about a-values
of Springer representations which we will recall in the next section.
Proposition 3. Let 1 be the trivial conjugacy and let C be any conjugacy class in A(O).
Then b̃(O,1) ≤ b̃(O,C) .
Proof. In the exceptional groups, we have verified this directly. In the classical groups, we
must show that for any λ ∈ No and (ν, η) ∈ No,c with λ = ν ∪ η that we have b̃λ ≤ b̃(ν,η) =
b̃ν + b̃η where the b̃-value is computed with respect to the appropriate subalgebras for λ, ν,
and η.
    In type B, b̃λ = 41 ki=1 λ2i − 21 i odd λi + 14 . For any (ν, η) with λ = ν ∪ η, we must
                         P            P

use both the b̃-value formula in type B for η and in type D for ν. It is clear that b̃ν + b̃η =
 1 Pk      2   1
 4    i=1 λi + 4 minus various λi . It turns out that that for each m either λ2m−1 or λ2m will
be subtracted in the formula, but not both, as we now show. There are four possibilities
for each m. If both λ2m−1 and λ2m belong to η or both belong to ν, then b̃(ν,η) will have
a term −λ2m−1 or −λ2m , but not both, since the formulas for B and D select every other
λi to subtract. If on the other hand, λ2m−1 belongs to η and λ2m belongs to ν, then again
b̃(ν,η) will have a term −λ2m−1 or −λ2m , but not both. This is because the parity of the
position of λ2m−1 in η will be the same as the parity of the position of λ2m in ν (as the
position of λ2m in λ is an even number, namely 2m). But the formula for B and D choose
to subtract parts whose positions have opposite parity. Hence, only one can be selected in
the formula for b̃ν + b̃η . The result is the same if λ2m−1 belongs to ν and λ2m belongs to
η. Thus in either of the four cases, the effect is to subtract a number which is less than or
equal to λ2m−1 since λ2m−1 ≥ λ2m , hence the inequality b̃λ ≤ b̃ν + b̃η .
    In types C and D, a similar argument holds, except we look at the consecutive parts
λ2m and λ2m+1 of λ (the part λ1 will never be subtracted in the formulas for the b̃-value).
One or the other, but not both, of these parts will be subtracted in the formula for b̃ν + b̃η
demonstrating the inequality.
  We recall some notation from [So2] in the classical groups
                                 Sodd = {i ∈ N| i 6≡ ε, ri ≡ 1}
                          Seven = {i ∈ N| i 6≡ ε, ri ≡ 0 and ri 6= 0}.
List the elements of Sodd in decreasing order jl ≥ jl−1 ≥ · · · ≥ j2 ≥ j1 . Assume that l is even
in type C by setting j1 = 0 if necessary (l is automatically odd in type B and automatically
even in type D).
   An element (ν, η) ∈ No,c determines two sets T1 and T2 such that T1 ⊂ Sodd and T2 ⊂
Seven coming from the parts of ν. Namely, the parts of ν (which each occur with multiplicity
one since ν is distinguished) consist precisely of the elements in T1 ∪ T2 . For j ∈ Sodd , let
8                                       ERIC SOMMERS

δj = 1 if j ∈ T1 and 0 if j ∈
                            / T1 . Note we are assuming that δl = 0 in types C and D. We
                (m)                       (m)
define subsets T2 of T2 as follows: let T2 consist of those i ∈ T2 such that jm+1 ≥ i ≥ jm
                                         (m)
and define tm to be the cardinality of T2 .
   The next proposition follows easily from the previous proposition and the formulas for
the b̃-value.

Proposition 4. In the classical groups (not of type A), the equality b̃(O,1) = b̃(O,C) holds if
and only if tm = 0 when m is even and δm+1 + tm + δm is even when m is odd.


                            5. Lusztig’s canonical quotient
   Our first main result is a new description of Lusztig’s canonical quotient Ā(O), which is
a quotient of A(O). These finite groups play an important role in Lusztig’s classification
of unipotent representations of finite groups of Lie type. Namely, the set of unipotent
representations for G (split, with connected center, over a finite field) is parametrized by
the following data: a special nilpotent orbit O, an element x ∈ Ā(O), and an irreducible
representation of the centralizer of x in Ā(O) (all up to the appropriate conjugation). We
hope to obtain a better understanding of this parametrization by having such an explicit
description of the canonical quotient and its conjugacy classes.
   Let us recall Lusztig’s definition of Ā(O). Although Lusztig assumed O is special, his
definition remains valid even if O is not special, so in what follows we do not assume O is
special.
   Recall that for each nilpotent element e and local system π on Oe , Springer has defined
a representation Ee,π which (if non-zero) is an irreducible representation of W . Recall also
that each irreducible representation E of W comes with two important numerical invariants.
One comes from the generic degree of E (the a-value) and one comes from the fake degree
of E (the b-value). We refer to [L2] for the definitions. Note that our notation is consistent
with [L2], but is not consistent with [L1] or [Ca]. In those sources, our b-value is their
a-value and our a-value is their ã-value. The original definition of the canonical quotient of
A(O) is as follows. Given e ∈ O, consider the set

                        S = {π ∈ Â(e) | Ee,π 6= 0 and aEe,π = aEe,1 }

where Â(e) is the set of irreducible representations of A(e) and Ee,1 denotes the Springer
representation associated to the trivial representation of A(e). Let H be the intersection of
all the kernels of the representations in S. Then Ā(O) is defined to be the quotient A(O)/H
[L2]. If a local system π is not equivariant for G when G is of adjoint type, then Ee,π will
be zero. Hence, the canonical quotient is the same for groups in the same isogeny class of
G and so we assume G is of adjoint type in what follows.

Remark 5. Lusztig has observed that for π ∈ Â(e) and Ee,π 6= 0 that aEe,π ≤ aEe,1 .
Compare this with proposition 3.

   In light of Lusztig’s original definition and proposition 3 we consider all conjugacy classes
C in A(O) with the property that b̃(O,C) = b̃(O,1) . Let H ′ be the union of all such conjugacy
classes.
                LUSZTIG’S CANONICAL QUOTIENT AND GENERALIZED DUALITY                          9

Theorem 6. The set H ′ coincides with H, so that Ā(O) = A(O)/H ′ . Moreover, the b̃-
value is constant on the cosets of H ′ = H in A(O) (which are always a union of conjugacy
classes).
Proof. We are assuming that G is of adjoint type (the result is still valid for any G). In the
exceptional groups we verified the results directly using the tables for a-values and Springer
representations in [Ca], the tables of conjugacy classes in A(O) in [So2], and knowledge of
the b̃-values for distinguished orbits given above.
  In the classical groups we need to do some work in order to understand which local
systems appear in the set S.
  We illustrate the situation in type Bn . Let O have partition λ = [λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λk ]. As
before, ri is the number of parts of λ of size i. So ri is even whenever i is even as we are in
type B. WeP associate to O a symbol as in chapter 13.3 of [Ca]. It consists of k elements.
Let di = j<i rj . Each odd i contributes to the symbol the interval of length ri
                          i−1         i−1                   i−1
                     (di +     , di +     + 1, . . . , di +     + ri − 1)
                            2          2                     2
and each even i contributes to the symbol the ri /2 numbers
                         di + i/2, di + i/2 + 2, . . . , di + i/2 + ri − 2
each repeated twice in weakly increasing order.
   Consider the elementary 2-group with basis consisting of elements xi , one for each odd
i with ri 6= 0. Then A(O) is the subgroup of this group consisting of elements expressible
as a sum of an even number of basis elements (this is because we are working in the special
orthogonal group and not in the full orthogonal group). Representations π of Â(O) are
thus specified by their values (of ±1) on the xi ’s. The representations π for which Ee,π is
non-zero are those with the property that
     #{xi | ri ≡ 1, di ≡ 0 and π(xi ) = −1} = #{xi | ri ≡ 1, di ≡ 1 and π(xi ) = −1}.
If ri is even, π may have the value 1 or −1 on xi .
   To determine the set S it is necessary to compute the a-value of each non-zero represen-
tation Ee,π (see chapter 11.4 of [Ca]). We have to convert between two different notations
for symbols. This is a bit of a pain, but the work is greatly simplified since we are only
interested in when the a-value of Ee,π equals the a-value of Ee,1 . We find that the set S
consists of the following π. Above we listed those odd i with ri odd (which was denoted
Sodd above) in decreasing order as jl ≥ jl−1 ≥ · · · ≥ j1 (note that l must be odd). If
π ∈ S, we must have π(xjl ) = 1 and π(xj2m ) = π(xj2m−1 ). Let i be odd and ri even. If
j2m+1 ≥ i ≥ j2m for some m, then π may take values ±1 on xi . If, on the other hand,
j2m ≥ i ≥ j2m−1 , then π(xi ) = π(xj2m−1 ).
   Since A(O) is abelian, each element forms its own conjugacy class. We need to relate our
two descriptions of conjugacy classes in A(O). Given x ∈ A(O) write x = xi1 +xi2 +· · ·+xi2m
where i1 ≥ i2 ≥ · · · ≥ i2m (the usual classical description). Then set ν = [i1 ≥ · · · ≥ i2m ]
and define η by λ = ν ∪ η. Then (ν, η) ∈ No,c exactly corresponds to the conjugacy class
                                                              (m)
of x ∈ A(O) (see [So1]). Using our previous notation of T2 , tm , and δj , we see that H
consists of those conjugacy classes where tm = 0 when m is even and δm+1 + tm + δm is
even when m is odd. By proposition 4 this is exactly the condition that the conjugacy class
10                                      ERIC SOMMERS

(ν, η) belongs to H ′ , showing that H ′ = H. Finally, the statement that b̃ is constant on
the cosets on H ′ = H is an easy computation similar to the one done to find which classes
belonged to H ′ .
   A similar proof holds in type C and D which we omit.

   For completeness we record Ā(O) in the classical groups. In the exceptional groups, Ā(O)
is listed in the last section.
   In type A, Ā(O) is trivial. In the other classical types, Ā(O) is an elementary 2-group.
Assuming G is the special orthogonal group in types B and D and G is the symplectic group
in type C, we describe a subgroup K of A(O) which maps bijectively onto Ā(O) = A(O)/H.
   In types B and D, consider the subgroup K of A(O) consisting of all elements expressible
                                                                                    (m)
as a sum of an even number of xi where i is equal to some jm for m odd or i ∈ T2 for m
even. In type C, consider the subgroup K of A(O) consisting of all elements expressible as
                                                             (m)
a sum of xi where i is equal to some jm for m odd or i ∈ T2 for m even. Then K ∼     = Ā(O).
In other words, the i in question correspond, in type B, to corners of the Young diagram
of λ which have odd length and odd height (i is odd and l is odd); in type D, to corners of
the Young diagram of λ which have odd length and even height (i is odd and l is even); in
type C, to corners of the Young diagram of λ which have even length and even height (i is
even and l is even).

                                         6. Duality
    Let L G be the Langlands dual group of G with Lie algebra L g (in other words, the root
data of L G and G are dual). Denote by L No the set of nilpotent orbits in L g and L Nosp the
set of special nilpotent orbits in L g.
    There is a natural order-preserving (and dimension-preserving) bijection between Nosp and
L N sp . Therefore we can also view Lusztig-Spaltenstein duality as a map d : N → L N sp . It
    o                                                                             o      o
is in this context that Barbasch and Vogan have given a representation-theoretic description
of Lusztig-Spaltenstein duality using primitive ideals [BV]. To distinguish between the
duality which stays within G and the version which passes to the dual group, we use the
notation d(O) to mean the dual orbit within g and we use the notation d(O,1) to mean the
dual orbit within L g. This is consistent with later (and earlier) notation.
    We will now define a map d : No,c → L N o with the property that it extends Lusztig-
Spaltenstein duality. It will turn out that d is surjective and depends only on the image of
C in the canonical quotient Ā(O). Moreover, if e′ ∈ d(O,C) , then we will have dim(L Be′ ) =
b̃(O,C) where L B denotes the flag variety of L G.
    The definition of d is as follows. Given (O, C) ∈ No,c , pick e ∈ O and a semisimple
element s ∈ ZG (e) whose image in A(e) ∼     = A(O) belongs to C. The group L = ZG (s) has as
its Lie algebra l = Zg(s) and clearly e ∈ l. Let Oel denote the orbit in l through e under the
action of L. Applying Lusztig-Spaltenstein duality dl with respect to l (we assume here that
dl stays within l and we don’t pass to the dual group), we obtain the orbit Ofl = dl(Oel ) ⊂ l.
At this point we simply apply Lusztig’s map from Chapter 13 of [L2].
    But first we recall the following result due to Joseph and proved uniformly in [BM]. Every
Weyl group representation of the form Ee,1 possesses property (B) of [LuSp] with respect
to G. That is, the b-value of Ee,1 coincides with dim(Be ) and moreover the multiplicity of
                LUSZTIG’S CANONICAL QUOTIENT AND GENERALIZED DUALITY                          11

Ee,1 in the harmonic polynomials of degree dim(Be ) on a Cartan subalgebra of g is exactly
one.
   The Springer correspondence for L produces an irreducible representation Ef,1 (always
non-zero) of W (s), the Weyl group of l = Zg(s). The second part of the statement of
property (B) means that we can apply the operation of truncated induction to Ef,1 (see
[L1]). So let E = jW W (E ) be the representation of W obtained by truncated induction
                       (s)  f,1
of Ef,1 from W (s) to W . Then E has the property that bE = bEf,1 from the definition of
truncated induction. Now consider E as a representation of L W , the Weyl group of L G
(since L W is isomorphic to W via the involution which interchanges long and short roots).
Lusztig has observed that E is always of the form Ee′ ,1 for some nilpotent element e′ in
L g (this will be re-verified explicitly below). We then define d                            L
                                                                 (O,C) to be the orbit in g
through e .′

   It is clear from the definition (assuming it is well-defined) and the first part of the
statement of property (B) (applied twice, once in L and once in L G) that dim(L B e′ ) = b̃(O,C)
as promised above.
Proposition 7. The duality map is well-defined; that is, it is independent of the choices
made for s and e.
Proof. We show that the representation E constructed above is independent of s (it is
clearly independent of e, since Springer representations only depend on the orbit through
e).
   One of the main properties of Lusztig-Spaltenstein duality is that if e ∈ l′ where l′ is a
Levi subalgebra of g, then
                                  dg(Oeg) = Indgl′ dl′ (Oel ).
                                                           ′



The notation on the right-side is Lusztig-Spaltenstein induction. According to [LuSp] and
the validity of property (B), one therefore has that
                                                W
                                 Edg (Oe ),1 = jW (l′ ) (Edl (Oel ),1 )

where W (l′ ) is the Weyl group of l′ .
   Now let S be a maximal torus in ZG (s, e). Then l′ = Zg(s, S) is a Levi subalgebra
of l = Zg(s) and e ∈ l′ ⊂ l. Moreover l′ is of the form Zg(s′ ) for a semisimple element
s′ ∈ ZG (e) and the image of s′ in A(e) necessarily belongs to C. By the transitivity of
truncated induction applied to the sequence l′ ⊂ l ⊂ g, we see that the representation E is
the same whether we work with respect to l or l′ , i.e. whether we work with s or s′ . The
main result of [So2] is that the pair (l′ , e) (up to simultaneous conjugation by elements in
G) is determined by (and determines in the case when G is of adjoint type) the conjugacy
class C ⊂ A(Oe ). In other words, (l′ , e) (up to simultaneous conjugation by elements in
G) is independent of the choice of s and thus the construction of E is independent of the
choices made for s and e.


   Proposition 1 now follows from the above proof either by invoking property (B) in L, or
                                                                                             ′
more simply by applying the dimension formula dim dl(Oel ) = dim(l) − dim(l′ ) + dim dl′ (Oel )
for induction of orbits from the Levi subalgebra l′ of l.

                            7. Duality in Classical Groups
   We now calculate the duality map for the classical groups not of type A (there is nothing
new here in type A). First, we assign to a partition λ (which may or may not correspond to a
nilpotent orbit in that classical group) a representation Eλ of the Weyl group of that group.
When λ corresponds to an actual nilpotent orbit, Eλ is just the Springer representation
Eλ,1 for the orbit with trivial local system.
   Let λ ∈ P(m) where m is even in types C, D and odd in type B. Form the dual partition
λ . Separate the parts of λ∗ into its odd parts 2α1 + 1 ≥ 2α2 + 1 ≥ 2α3 + 1 · · · ≥ 2αr + 1
 ∗

and its even parts 2β1 ≥ 2β2 ≥ 2β3 · · · ≥ 2βs . We then associate to λ the representation
Eλ = jWW (ǫ ′ ) where W ′ is the Weyl group of the subsystem of type
         ′  W
             
             Bα1 × Bβ1 × Dα2 +1 × Dβ2 × Bα3 × Bβ3 × Dα4 +1 × Dβ4 . . . in type B,

and ǫW ′ is the sign representation of W ′ = W (Φ′ ). In type D we are thinking of the
representation as truncated induction in type B followed by restriction to W (Dn ) ⊂ W (Bn )
which is known to produce an irreducible representation as long as λ is not very even (we
ignore the case where λ is very even since we never need to consider it in what follows).
Lemma 8. When λ corresponds to a nilpotent orbit in the appropriate classical group, Eλ
is the Springer representation of this orbit with the trivial local system.
Proof. This is shown by following Lusztig’s version of Shoji’s algorithm (see chapter 13.3 of
[Ca]).

Lemma 9. For two partitions λ, µ with the same X-collapse where X = B, C, or D, we
have Eλ = Eµ as representations of W (Xn ).
Proof. We give the proof in type B, the other types being similar. Assume λ ∈ P(2n+1), but
λ∈ / PB (2n + 1). List all the even parts of λ in decreasing order as λe1 ≥ λe2 ≥ · · · ≥ λel .
Then there exists an m such that λe2m−1 > λe2m since λ ∈        / PB (2n + 1). Let µ be the
partition obtained from λ by replacing the part λe2m−1 by λe2m−1 − 1 and the part λe2m by
λe2m + 1 and leaving all other parts of λ unchanged. This is the basic B-collapsing move
(see [CM]) and it suffices to show that Eµ = Eλ . The dual partition µ∗ equals λ∗ except
that µ∗λe +1 = λ∗λe +1 + 1 and µ∗λe         = λ∗λe     − 1. Now write λ∗ = α ∪ β where α and
         2m          2m               2m−1        2m−1
β consist respectively of the odd and even parts of λ∗ . Given a part λ∗i of λ∗ , recall that
we are calling i the position of λ∗i in λ∗ . Now λ∗i will occur as a part of either α or β. We
refer to its position in whichever partition α or β it occurs in as its parity position. We use
similar language for µ∗ .
   Assume first that a = λ∗λe +1 is even. Then it is possible to show that the parity
                                2m
position of λ∗λe +1 is odd and the parity position of µ∗λe +1 = λ∗λe +1 + 1 is also odd.
                2m                                           2m           2m
These parts will each contribute a root subsystem of type Ba/2 in the definition of Eλ or
Eµ , respectively. On the other hand, if a is odd the parity position of these parts is both
even and they will each contribute a root subsystem of type D(a+1)/2 in the definition of
Eλ or Eµ , respectively.

  Since there are no even parts of λ between λe2m−1 and λe2m , we have λ∗λe                     =
                                                                                       2m +2j
                               λe2m−1 −λe2m
λ∗λe +2j+1 for j = 1, 2, . . . ,    2         − 1. Since the same equalities hold for µ∗ , we
    2m
see that these parts (which come in pairs) contribute the same terms to Eλ and Eµ .
    Finally consider b = λ∗λe     . If b is even, then the parity position of both λ∗λe     and
                             2m−1                                                      2m−1
  ∗
µλe       is even, so they contribute a term Db/2 in the definition of Eλ or Eµ , respectively.
    2m−1
And if b is odd, then they both have odd parity position and their contribution is B(b−1)/2 .
    Hence a basic collapsing move does not affect the attached representation and the result
is proved.

Remark 10. The formulas for the b̃-values in the classical groups are a consequence of the
previous propositions and the validity of property (B).
                                                 sp
     We now explain the bijection between PB        (2n + 1) and PCsp (2n) explicitly in terms of
partitions (see [Sp], [KP]). Given λ = [λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λk−1 ≥ λk ] ∈ PB (2n + 1), let λ− = [λ1 ≥
                                                         sp
· · · ≥ λk−1 ≥ λk − 1] and set λC = λ−             C
                                        C . Then λ ∈ PC (2n). Similarly given λ = [λ1 ≥ · · · ≥
λk ] ∈ PC (2n), let λ+ = [λ1 +1 ≥ · · · ≥ λk−1 ≥ λk ] and λ+ = [λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λk−1 ≥ λk ≥ 1] and
                                 sp
set λB = (λ+ )B . Then λB ∈ PB      (2n + 1) and moreover, λB = (λ+ )∗B )∗ . For λ ∈ PB (2n + 1),
we have (λC )B = (λ∗B )∗ ; in particular, if λ is special, (λC )B = λ. Similarly for λ ∈ PC (2n),
we have (λB )C = (λ∗C )∗ ; in particular, if λ is special, (λB )C = λ.
     In what follows we identify representations of W (Bn ) and W (Cn ) via the isomorphism
of these two Coxeter groups which corresponds to interchanging long and short roots.
Lemma 11. For λ ∈ PC (2n) we have Eλ∗ = E(λB )∗ , where the left side of the identity is
computed in type C and the right in type B. For λ ∈ PB (2n + 1) we have Eλ∗ = E(λC )∗ ,
where the left side of the identity is computed in type B and the right in type C.
Proof. We prove the first isomorphism. We noted above that (λB )∗ = (λ+ )∗B and so in type
B, E(λB )∗ = E(λ+ )∗ since by the previous proposition we can omit the B-collapse on the
right side. To prove the desired identity we must study the odd and even parts of λ (in
type C) and λ+ (in type B). These partitions are the same except that the latter has an
extra part equal to 1 at the end. Now because λ ∈ PC (2n) the definition of the subsystem
in equation (4) for Eλ∗ in type C and for E(λ+ )∗ in type B coincide (with the extra part in
λ+ playing no role at all).
   We now prove the second isomorphism. The first isomorphism implies that E(λC )∗ =
E((λC )B )∗ , where the left side is in type C and the right in type B. Since λ ∈ PB (2n + 1),
we have (λC )B = (λ∗B )∗ and thus E((λC )B )∗ = E(λ∗B ) = Eλ∗ . The last equality holds since in
type B we can omit the B-collapse.

Theorem 12. Our duality map d : No,c → L No sends the pair (ν, η) to the orbit λ according
to the following recipe:

  Note that the case of ν equal to the empty partition corresponds to Lusztig-Spaltenstein
duality. In type D if ν is non-empty, our assumptions about (ν, η) ensure that η is not very
even.
Proof. We may choose s ∈ ZG (e) representing C so that l = Zg(s) has semisimple rank
equal to the rank of g. Then e ∈ l is specified by the pair of partitions (ν, η). Our first step
is to compute the Springer representation Edl (e),1 of W (s) associated to dl(e). The pair of
partitions associated to dl(e) is
                                          ∗    ∗
                                        (νD , ηB ) g type B
(6)                                     (νC∗ , ηC
                                                ∗
                                                  ) g type C
                                          ∗    ∗
                                        (νD , ηD ) g type D
By lemmas 8 and 9, the associated Springer representation Edl (e),1 of W (s) is Eν ∗ ⊠ Eη∗ .
Consider this now as a representation of W (Dk ) × W (Cn−k ) in type B, W (Ck ) × W (Bn−k )
in type C, and W (Dk ) × W (Dn−k ) in type D (there is no change in type D). Then by
applying lemma 11 in types B and C and lemma 9 again in type D, this representation can
be described as
                                 Eν ∗ ⊠ E(ηC )∗ g type B
(7)                              Eν ∗ ⊠ E(ηB )∗ g type C
                                     Eν ∗ ⊠ E(η∗ )D g type D
These representations possess property (B) as they possess property (B) in each simple
component. Hence we can apply truncated induction up to W (L g). Then by transitivity of
induction we claim that we arrive at the representation
                                     E(ν∪ηC )∗ g type B
(8)                                     E(ν∪ηB )∗ g type C
                                            ∗ )∗ )∗ g type D
                                      E(ν∪(ηD
where the first is a representation of W (Cn ), the second of W (Bn ), and the third of W (Dn ).
In type D, we use the fact that (ηD  ∗ )∗ belongs to P (2n − k). Therefore in all types if the
                                                       C
multiplicity of i in ν is odd, then the multiplicity of i in η C , η B , or (ηD
                                                                              ∗ )∗ , respectively, is

even. Then the validity of equation (8) follows from the definition of E in equation (4).
   The proof is completed by applying lemma 9 in L g.

                                          8. Bookends
Proposition 13. Our duality map is surjective.
Proof. We verified this case-by-case (Lusztig already did this in his work with his original
map although the details are not recorded). In fact, we will try to exhibit canonical elements
(O, C) of No,c which map bijectively to L Nosp . These are denoted by a star (*) in the tables
for the exceptional groups and we now explain their construction in the classical groups.
   Assume L g is of type X where X = B, C, D and λ ∈ PX (m) where m is even or odd
depending on X. Consider λ∗ . We ask whether λ∗ belongs to PB (m), PC (m), or PC (m)
depending on whether X is B, C, or D, respectively. In other words, we ask whether λ
is special (note the funny situation in type D). If not, we may uniquely write λ∗ = ν ∪ µ
                 LUSZTIG’S CANONICAL QUOTIENT AND GENERALIZED DUALITY                           15

where ν is distinguished of type C, D, or D, and where µ belongs to PB (m′ ), PC (m′ ), or
PC (m′ ), for some m′ , depending on whether X is B, C, or D.
   We now show that µ has the property that µ∗ ∈ PX (m′ ). This is because λ ∈ PX (m) and
the process of forming µ∗ amounts to taking λ and diminishing some of its parts; however,
parts not congruent to ǫ will only be diminished by an even number, so the resulting
partition remains of the same type as λ. Hence µ∗ ∈ PX (m′ ) for some m′ . It follows that
        sp
µ∗ ∈ PX    (m′ ) since µ belonged to PB (m′ ), PC (m′ ), or PC (m′ ) depending on X. It is also
true that µ is itself special in types B and C.
   We can now define η. In type B we set η = µC ; in type C we set η = µB ; and in type D
we set η = µD . Now because µ∗ is special (and µ is special in types B and C), we have η B =
(µC )B = µ in type B; η C = (µB )C = µ in type C; and (ηD    ∗ )∗ = (((µ∗ )∗ )∗ )∗ = (µ∗ )∗ = µ in
                                                                           D D
type D. The second equality in type D follows since applying Lusztig-Spaltenstein duality
twice (to µ∗ in this case) is the identity on special orbits.
   Thus in all types d(ν,η) = (ν ∪ µ)∗X = (λ∗ )∗X = λX = λ where the last equality holds since
λ ∈ PX (m). We conclude in all types that (ν, η) has the property that d(ν,η) = λ.

Remark 14. These canonical elements (O, C) that we have listed which surject onto L No
have the property that O is always special. In fact, all orbits O′ of L No in the same special
piece are affiliated with the same special orbit O of g and in fact O = d(O′ ,1) (nilpotent
orbits are in the same special piece exactly when their dual orbits are the same). Hence
for each orbit O′ in L No we get a conjugacy class in Ā(O) where O = d(O′ ,1) . This should
be the same conjugacy class that Lusztig attaches to orbits in [L3] under the identification
Ā(O) ∼
      = Ā(d(O,1) ).

Proposition 15. Let C, C ′ be conjugacy classes in A(O) whose image in Ā(O) coincide,
then d(O,C) = d(O,C ′ ) .
Proof. Again we checked this on a case-by-case basis. In the exceptional groups, this
amounts to a quick glance at the tables which follow. In the classical groups, it requires
attention to the computations in the proof of theorem 12, together with the explicit de-
scription of the canonical quotient. We omit the details.

                         9. Duality in Exceptional Groups
   To compute the duality in the exceptional groups we used knowledge of Lusztig-Spaltenstein
duality and the Springer correspondence (see [Ca]). Furthermore, we computed truncated
induction by using the induce/restrict tables of Alvis [AL]. We have listed only those orbits
with non-trivial component groups when G is of adjoint type since these are the only orbits
for which we are saying something new. The stars(*) refer to the (putatively) canonical
pair (O, C) which maps to a given orbit in the dual Lie algebra as is done in proposition 13
for the classical groups.
