                                             finite dimensional reductive Lie algebras. More precisely, the subject of the paper
                                             is a realization of the infinite dimensional Z–graded Witt algebra of all Laurent

                                             the Lie algebra sl(2, C) (the so-called qR –conformal symmetries). These infinite di-
                                             mensional Lie algebras are realized by the qR –conformal symmetries approximately.
                                             In the article there are considered two kinds of approximate representations: the
                                             representations up to a class S of operators (Hilbert-Schmidt operators, compact
                                             operators or finite-rank operators) and asymptotic representations “mod O(~)”,
                                             where ~ is a parameter (in this case several definitions of an operator “O–large” by
                                             the parameter ~ are possible). The approximate representations of the first kind
                                             may be naturally considered in the context of the pseudo-differential calculus [1,2],
                                             whereas ones of the second kind – in the context of the asymptotic methods [3-5].
                                             Note that the asymptotic representations “mod O(~)” were explored in the formal-
                                             ism of the Karasev-Maslov asymptotic quantisation [6], and representations up to
                                             S are certain generalisations of the projective representations [7,8].
                                                Results of the article, some of which were anonced in the electronic preprints of
                                             the electronic archive on functional analysis (the Los Alamos National Laboratories,
                                             USA), should be considered more as observations than as theorems with laborious
                                             proofs, which are not clear from their formulations. Proofs of all facts are performed
                                             really in one step and are bulky computative exercises (omitted where it is possible)

devoted, in general, to the formulations of results themselves.

                            §1. Preliminary definitions
1.1. The Lie algebra sl(2, C) and Verma modules over it. Lie algebra sl(2, C)
is a three-dimensional space of 2×2 complex matrices with zero trace supplied by the
standard commutator [X, Y ] = XY − Y X, where the right hand side multiplication
is the standard matrix multiplication. In the basis
                                    1                          
                        0 1                  0               0    0
               l−1 =           , l0 = 2           , l1 =
                        0 0             0 − 12              −1 0

the commutation relations are of the form: [li , lj ] = (i − j)li+j (i, j = −1, 0, 1). Lie
algebra sl(2, C) is Z–graded: deg(li ) = − ad(l0 )li = i, where ad(X) is the adjoint
action operator in the Lie algebra: ad(X)Y = [X, Y ]. Therefore, Z–graded modules
over sl(2, C) are l0 –diagonal. A vector v in a Z–graded module over the Lie algebra
                                                                           n
sl(2, C) is called extremal iff l1 v = 0 and the linear span of vectors l−1  v (n ∈ Z+ )
coincides with the module itself (i.e. v is a cyclic vector). A Z–graded module with
an extremal vector (in this case it is defined up to a multiplier) is called extremal
[11]. An extremal module is called the Verma module [12] iff the action of l−1
                                    n
is free in it, i.e. the vectors l−1   v are linearly independent. In the case of the
Lie algebra sl(2, C) the Verma modules are just the same as infinite dimensional
extremal modules. An extremal weight of the Verma module is the number defined
by the equality l0 v = hv, where v is the extremal vector. The Verma modules are
defined for all complex numbers h and are pairwise nonisomorphic. Below we shall
consider the Verma modules with real extremal weights only.
   The Verma module Vh over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) with the extremal weight
h may be realized in the space C[z] of polynomials of a complex variable z. The
formulas for the generators of the Lie algebra sl(2, C) are of the form:

                     l−1 = z,    l0 = z∂z + h,    l1 = z∂z2 + 2h∂z ,
               d
here ∂z = dz     .
    The Verma module is nondegenerate (i.e. does not contain any proper sub-
module) iff h 6= − n2 (n ∈ Z+ ). The Verma module Vh is called unitarizable (or
hermitean) iff it admits a structure of the pre-Hilbert space such that li∗ = l−i . The
completion of the unitarizable Verma module will be denoted by VhHilb . The Lie
algebra sl(2, C) acts in VhHilb by the unbounded operators. Also it is rather useful
to consider the formal Verma modules Vhform , which are realized in the space C[[z]]
of formal power series of a complex variable z, whereas the formulas for generators
of the Lie algebra sl(2, C) coincide with ones above. Note that Vh ⊆ VhHilb ⊆ Vhform
and modules Vh , VhHilb , Vhform form the Gelfand triple or the Dirac equipment of the
Hilbert space VhHilb . An action of the real form of the Lie algebra sl(2, C) generated
by the anti-Hermitean operators il0 , l1 − l−1 and i(l1 + l−1 ) in the Hilbert space
VhHilb by the unbounded operators is exponentiated to a unitary representation of
the corresponding simply connected Lie group.
    In the nonunitarizable Verma module over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) there exists
the unique (up to a scalar multiple) indefinite sesquilinear form (·, ·) such that
(li v1 , v2 ) = (v1 , l−i v2 ) for any two vectors v1 and v2 from the Verma module. If this
                                            2
sesquilinear form is nondegenerate (in this case the Verma module is nondegenerate)
then it has a signature (n, ∞), where n is finite, and therefore, there is defined a
Pontryagin completion [10] of the Verma module. The corresponding module in
which the Lie algebra sl(2, C) acts by the unbounded operators will be denoted
by VhPontr . The following chain of inclusions holds: Vh ⊆ VhPontr ⊆ Vhform . An
action of the real form of the Lie algebra sl(2, C) generated by the anti-Hermitean
(with respect to the nondegenerate indefinite sesquilinear form (·, ·)) operators il0 ,
l1 − l−1 and i(l1 + l−1 ) in the Pontryagin space VhPontr by the unbounded operators
is exponentiated to a pseudounitary representation of the corresponding simply
connected Lie group.
1.2. Hidden symmetries in Verma modules over the lie algebra sl(2, C):
Lobachevskii-Berezin C ∗ –algebra and qR –conformal symmetries.
Proposition 1 [13]. In the nondegenerate Verma module Vh over the Lie algebra
sl(2, C) there are uniquely defined the operators D and F such that

                      [D, l−1 ] = 1,     [D, l0 ] = D,     [D, l1 ] = D2 ,
                       [l−1 , F ] = 1,    [l0 , F ] = F,   [l1 , F ] = F 2 .

If the Verma modules are realized in the space C[z] of polynomials of a complex
variable z then
                                                1
                           D = ∂z ,     F = z ξ+2h ,
where ξ = z∂z . The operators F and D obey the following relations:

                 [F D, DF ] = 0,         [D, F ] = qR (1 − DF )(1 − F D),
             1
where qR = 2h−1 . In the unitarizable Verma module (qR 6= 0) the operators F and
D are bounded and F ∗ = D, D∗ = F .
   The algebra generated by the variables t and t∗ with the relations [tt∗ , t∗ t] = 0
and [t, t∗ ] = qR (1 − tt∗ )(1 − t∗ t) being the Berezin quantization of the Lobachevskii
plane realized in the unit complex disc (the Poincarè realization) [14] is called the
Lobachevskii-Berezin algebra. Proposition 1 allows to consider the Lobachevskii-
Berezin algebra as a C ∗ –algebra. The Lobachevskii-Berezin C ∗ –algebra war redis-
covered recently by S.Klimek and A.Lesnievsky [15].
Proposition 2 [13]. In the nongenerate Verma module Vh over the Lie algebra
sl(2, C) there are uniquely defined the operators Ln (n ∈ Z) such that

                    [li , Ln ] = (i − n)Li+n        (i = 1, 2, 1; n ∈ Z),

moreover, Li = li (i = −1, 0, 1). If the Verma modules are realized in the space
C[z] of polynomials of a complex variable z then

                                                              ξ+(k+1)h
      Lk = (xi + (k + 1)h)∂zk (k ≥ 0),         L−k = z k (ξ+2h)...(ξ+2h+k−1) (k ≥ 1),

where ξ = z∂z . The operators Ln obey the following relations:

                [Ln , Lm ] = (n − m)Ln+m , if n, m ≥ −1 or n, m ≤ 1.
                                               3
In the unitarizable Verma module the operators Ln are unbounded and L∗i = L−1 .
   The operators Ln are called the qR –conformal symmetries. They may be sym-
bolically represented in the form:

                 Ln = Dnh L0 Dn(1−h) ,                L−n = F n(1−h) L0 F nh .

To supply the symbolical recording by a sense one should use the general commu-
tation relations

 [Ln , f (D)] = (−D)n+1 f ′ (D) (n ≥ −1),                [L−n , f (F )] = F n+1 f ′ (D) (n ≥ −1)

for n = 0.
   The commutation relations for the operators D, F and the generators of qR –
conformal symmetries with the generators of the Lie algebra sl(2, C) mean that the
families Jk and Lk (k ∈ Z), where Ji = Di , J−i = F i (i ∈ Z+ ), are families of
tensor operators [8,16] for the Lie algebra sl(2, C).
   To the families of tensor operators Jk and Lk one may correspond the generating
functions – the operator fields, i.e. the formal Laurent series of a complex variable
u with operator coefficients:
                         X                           X
                 J(u) =      Ji (−u)−1−i , T (u) =     Li (−u)−2−i .
                           i∈Z                                i∈Z


For any value of u an operator field realizes a mapping from Vh into Vhform . The
fact that Jk and Tk (k ∈ Z) form families of tensor operators on the language of
operator fields means that

[li , J(u)] = (−u)i J(u) − (−u)i+1 J ′ (u),          [li , T (u)] = 2(−u)i T (u) − (−u)i+1 T ′ (u).

The operator fields V (u), which transform as s–differentials under the action of
the Lie algebra sl(2, C) (i.e. which obey the identity [li , V (u)] = s(−u)i V (u) −
(−u)i+1 V ′ (u)), are called the sl(2, C)–primary fields of spin s; so the operator
fields J(u) and T (u) are sl(2, C)–primary ones of spin 1 and 2. The operator fields
J(u) and T (u) as well as their properties are explored in detail in [13].
1.3. Infinite dimensional Z–graded Lie algebras: the Witt algebra wC of
all Laurent polynomial vector fields on a circle and the Virasoro alge-
bra virC , its one-dimensional nontrivial central extension. The Lie algebra
Vect(S 1 ) is realized in the space of C ∞ –smooth vector fields v(t)∂t on a circle
S 1 ≃ R/2πZ with the commutator

                    [v1 (t)∂t , v2 (t)∂t ] = (v1 (t)v2′ (t) − v1′ (t)v2 (t))∂t .

In the basis sn = sin(nt)∂t , cn = cos(nt)∂t , h = ∂t the commutation relations have
the form:
              [sn , sm ] = 12 ((m − n)sn+m + sgn(n − m)(n + m)s|n−m| ),
              [cn , cm ] = 21 ((n − m)sn+m + sgn(n − m)(n + m)s|n−m| ),
              [sn , cm ] = 12 ((m − n)cn+m − (m + n)c|n−m| ) − nδnm h,
               [h, sn ] = ncn ,     [h, cn ] = −nsn .
                                                 4
Let us denote by VectC (S 1 ) the complexification of the Lie algebra Vect(S 1 ). In
the basis en = ieikt ∂t the commutation relations in the Lie algebra Li VectC (S 1 )
have the form:
                               [ej , ek ] = (j − k)ej+k .
    It is rather convenient to consider an imbedding of the circle S 1 into the complex
plane C with the coordinate z, so that z = eit on the circle and the elements
of the basis ek (k ∈ Z) are represented by the Laurent polynomial vector fields:
ek = z k+1 ∂z . The Z–graded Lie algebra generated by the Laurent polynomial vector
fields (i.e. by the finite linear combinations of elements of the basis ek ) is called the
Witt algebra and is denoted by wC . The Witt algebra wC is the complexification of
the subalgebra w of the algebra Vect(S 1 ) generated by the trigonometric polynomial
vector fields on a circle S 1 , i.e. by the finite linear combinations of elements of the
basis sn , cn and h.
    The Lie algebra Vect(S 1 ) admits a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension
defined by the Gelfand-Fuchs 2-cocycle [17]:
                                            Z       2π
                c(v1 (t)∂t , v2 (t)∂t ) =                (v1′ (t)v2′′ (t) − v2′ (t)v1′ (t)) dt.
                                                0


This extension being continued to the complexification VectC (S 1 ) of the Lie algebra
Vect(S 1 ) and reduced to the subalgebra wC defines a central one-dimensional ex-
tension of the Witt algebra, which is called the Virasoro algebra and is denoted by
virC . The Virasoro algebra is generated by the elements ek (k ∈ Z) and the central
element c with the commutation relations:

                                                                      j3 − j
                            [ej , ek ] = (j − k)ej+k +                       c
                                                                        12
and is the complexification of a central extension vir of the Lie algebra w. In the
irreducible representation the central element c of the Virasoro algebra is mapped
to a scalar operator, which is proportional to the identity operator with a coefficient
called the central charge.

           §2. HS–projective representation of the Witt algebra
               in Verma modules over the Lie algebra sl(2, C)
2.1. A–projective representations [9].
Definition 1A. Let A be an associative algebra represented by linear operators in
the linear space H and g be the Lie algebra. The linear mapping T : g 7→ End(H)
is called a A–projective representation iff for any X and Y from g there exists an
element of the algebra A represented by the operator AXY such that

                           [T (X), T (Y )] − T ([X, Y ]) = AXY .

  If H is infinite dimensional then the representation may be realized by the un-
bounded operators with suitable domains of definition.
Remark 1. Definition 1A may be generalized for arbitrary anticommutative algeb-
ras. In this situation it is deeply related to the constructions of representations of
                                                         5
the anti-commutative algebras jl(2, C) and sl∗ (2, C) from [18,19;20:§2]. In general,
it should be considered in the context of old ideas of A.I.Maltsev on representations
of arbitarary nonassociative algebras [21]. General anti-commutative algebras and
constructions of their A–projective representations are interesting for the theory
of quasi-Hopf algebras, which are nonassociative as coalgebras, jacobian and c-
jacobian quasi-bialgebras and related structures (see refs in [9]).
Example. If (g, h) is a reductive pair then any representation of the Lie algebra g is a
U(h)–projective representation of the binary anticommutative algebra p (g = h ⊕ p,
the binary operation in p has the standard form: [X, Y ]p = π([X, Y ]), where [·, ·] is
the commutator in g and π is the projector of g onto p along h [22]).
Remark 2. The standard projective representation is a particular case of Def.1A if
the algebra A is one-dimensional and acts in H by scalar operators.
Remark 3. If H is a Hilbert (or pre-Hilbert) space then one may consider the algebra
HS of all Hilbert-Schmidt operators as A. It is possible to consider the algebras B,
K, T C and F R of all bounded, compact, trace class and finite-rank operators, too.
Definition 1B. Let A be an associative algebra with an involution ∗ symmetrically
represented in the Hilbert space H. If g is a Lie algebra with an involution ∗ then its
A–projective representation T in the space H is called symmetric iff for all elements
a from g T (a∗ ) = T ∗ (a). Let g be Z–graded Lie algebra (g = ⊕n∈Z gn ) with an
involution ∗ such that g∗n = g−n and involution is identical on the subalgebra
g0 . Let us extend the Z–grading and the involution ∗ from the Lie algebra g to
the tensor algebra T· (g). A symmetric A–projective representation of g ia called
absolutely symmetric iff for any element a of the algebra T· (g) such that deg(a) = 0
the identity T (a) = T ∗ (a) holds (here the representation T of the Lie algebra g in
H is extended to the mapping of T· (g) into End(H).
Definition 1C. A A–projective representation T of the Lie algebra g in the linear
space H is called almost absolutely closed iff for any natural n and arbitrary elements
X0 , X1 , X2 , . . . Xn+1 of the Lie algebra g there exists an element ϕ(X0 , X1 , X2 , . . .
Xn+1 ) of the algebra g such that

[ . . . [[T (X0 ), T (X1 )], T (X2 )], . . . , T (Xn+1 )] ≡ T (ϕ(X0 , X1 , X2 , . . . Xn+1 )) (mod A),

here A is considered as represented in End(H). An almost absolutely closed A–
projective representation T of the Lie algebra g in the linear space H is called
absolutely closed iff ϕ(·, . . . , ·) ≡ 0.
   The mappings (X0 , X1 , X2 , . . . Xn+1 ) 7→ ϕ(X0 , X1 , X2 , . . . Xn+1 ) associated with
an almost absolutely closed A–projective representation of the Lie algebra g define
the higher brackets in the Lie algebra g. Objects with higher brackets systematically
appear in many branches of mathematics and mathematical physics (see e.g. the
book [6] or the article [23] among others and numerous references wherein).
2.2. HS–projective representation of the Witt algebra by qR –conformal
symmetries in the unitarizable Verma modules Vh over the Lie algebra
sl(2, C) [9]. Note that the Witt algebra wC admits a natural involution ∗.
Theorem 1A. The generators Lk (k ∈ Z) of qR –conformal symmetries in the
unitarizable Verma module Vh over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) realize an absolutely
                                                  6
symmetric HS–projective representation of the Witt algebra wC . Adding the tensor
operators Jk (k ∈ Z) to the tensor operators Lk one receives an absolutely symmet-
ric HS–projective representation of a semi-direct sum of the Witt algebra and the
infinite-dimensional Z–graded Heisenberg algebra (the one-dimensional central ex-
tension of the infinite-dimensional Z–graded abelian Lie algebra C[z, z −1 ] of Laurent
polynomials).

   The statement of the theorem follows from the explicit formulas for generators of
qR –conformal symmetries and tensor operators Jk . A verification on the belonging
to the class HS of Hilbert-Schmidt operators for operators of the fixed degree
with respect to the grading in the Z–graded space of polynomials C[z] supplied by
the certain scalar product with orthogonal weight spaces (such as any unitarizable
Verma module over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) is) does not produce any problems.

Remark 4. The HS–projective representations of the Witt algebra in the unitari-
zable Verma modules over sl(2, C) are absolutely closed.

Remark 5. Theorem 1A is generalized for the pseudo-unitary case with the sub-
stitution of the class HS of Hilbert-Schmidt operators to the class K of compact
operators.
   The results on the “exponentiated” version of Theorem 1A are announced in the
e-prints [24,25].

2.3. F R–projective representations of the Witt algebra in Verma mo-
dules over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) with the extremal weight 1 and 21 . The
sattement of Theorem 1A may be strengthened in some particular cases.

Theorem 1B. For h = 1 or h = 21 the HS–projective representation of the Witt
algebra by qR –conformal symmetries in the unitarizable Verma modules over the
Lie algebra sl(2, C) is F R–projective. For h = 21 the HS–projective representation
of a semi-direct sum of the Witt algebra and the infinite-dimensional Heisenberg
algebra is also F R–projective.

  The statement follows from the explicit formulas for tensor operators Lk and Jk .

Remark 6. For h = 0 the K–projective representation of the Witt algebra in the
Verma module over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) is F R–projective.

2.4. B–projective representations of the Witt algebra. Note that one of
disadvantages of many A–projective representations, in particular, if A is a cer-
tain operator class K, HS, T C or F R, is that their set is not closed under tensor
products, in general. For the class B of bounded operators the tensor products of B–
projective representations are defined. However, any S–projective representation,
where S is one of classes above, is B–projective and as such is sometimes nontrivial
(when the initial representation is realized by unbounded operators), that allows
to construct their tensor products, which will be nontrivial B–projective represen-
tations in this case.
   Let us call a S–projective representation of the Lie algebra g (S is a certain
operator class) S–irreducible iff the representation operators can not be simulta-
neously transform by an addition of elements of S to the form, in which they have
a common proper invariant subspace.
                                          7
Theorem 2. Let Th be the B–projective representation of the Witt algebra wC by
the qR –conformal symmetries in the Verma module Vh over the Lie algebra sl(2, C)
then the B–projective representations S n (Th ) (here S n denotes the functor of the
n-th symmetric degree, cf.[26]) are B–irreducible.
   The statement of the theorem follows from the explicit formulas for generators
of qR –conformal symmetries.
Remark 7. Decompositions of the tensor products Th1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Thn of B–projective
representations Thi on B–irreducible components are not known in general case.

      §3. Asymptotic representations of the Witt algebra and the
     Virasoro algebra in Verma modules over the Lie algebra sl(2, C)
3.1. The asymptotics of qR –conformal symmetries in Verma modules Vh
over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) at qR → 0 (h → 21 ) and at qR → 1 (h → 1) and
the Witt algebra wC . Let A be the algebra of all finite linear combinations of
expressions of the form f (qp)pn (n ∈ Z+ ) or q n f (qp) (n ∈ Z+ ), where [p, q] = 1
and f are rational functions, whose denominators have no zeroes in integer points.
Let us call the algebra A the extended Weyl algebra. The extended Weyl algebra is
a topological algebra with respect to natural convergence.
Lemma. The extended Weyl algebra A admits a strict representation in the Verma
module Vh (h 6∈ Z/2):
                           p → ∂z ,   q → z.
Generators of qR –conformal symmetries Lk (k ∈ Z) as well as generators D, F of
the Lobachevskii-Berezin algebra belong to the image of the extended Weyl algebra
A.
   Below we shall interpret the “O–large” for the asymptotics of operators in the
Verma modules over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) with non-half-integer extremal weights,
which belong to the extended Weyl algebra (because its representations in the
Verma modules are strict one can identify the algebra itself with its image) in the
sense of topology in the extended Weyl algebra.
Theorem 3A. Generators of qR –conformal symmetries in the Verma modules
V 21 +~ (0 < ~ < 12 ) over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) form an asymptotic “mod O(~)”
representation of the Witt algebra wC .
     Generators of qR –conformal symmetries in the Verma modules V1±~ (0 < ~ < 21 )
over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) form an asymptotic “mod O(~)” representation of the
Witt algebra wC , too.
   The first statement of the theorem, which immediately follows from the explicit
form of generators of qR –conformal symmetries, was in fact proved in [10], where
the corresponding “exponentiated” version was considered. The second is similar
to the first.
Remark 8. The statement of the theorem is not true if the “O–large” is considered in
sense of (weak) operator convergence in the space of operators in the Verma modules
Vh over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) identified with the space C[z] of polynomials.
   An answer on the question on a “divergence” between theorem 3A and the
remark 8 is in the following: the strict representations of the extended Weyl algebra
                                         8
do not even exist for the limit value ~ = 0, but being continuous (in a weak operator
topology in the space Vh ) for all values of the parameter ~ from an interval 0 <
~ < 21 , are not uniformly continuous on this interval. Note that the continuous
representations of the extended Weyl algebra in the verma modules Vh over the Lie
algebra sl(2, C) can be extended to representations by unbounded operators in the
spaces VhHilb (or VhPontr ), and, therefore, uncontinuous, that, however, is typical for
the representation theory of Lie algebras.
3.2. The estimation “mod HS” of the second term of the asymptotics
of qR –conformal symmetries in Verma modules Vh over the Lie algebra
sl(2, C) at qR → 0 (h → 21 ) and at qR → 1 (h → 1) and the Virasoro algebra
virC . Under the “hybridization” of the approximations “mod O(~n )” and “mod S”
an interesting phenomenon of “noncommutativity” of estimations is observed, the
asymptotics of qR –conformal symmetries supply us by an example.
Theorem 3B. For generators of qR –conformal symmetries in the Verma mod-
ules V 21 +~ (0 < ~ < 21 ) over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) the following asymptotics
“mod O(~2 )” exists:

                         [Li , Lj ] = (i − j)Li+j + ~A + O(~2 ),

where
                                   2 3
                               A≡    (i − i)δij mod HS .
                                   3
So generators of qR –conformal symmetries form an approximate representation of
the Virasoro algebra virC for h → 12 in the specified sense.
    For generators of qR –conformal symmetries in the Verma modules V1±~ (0 < ~ <
1                                                                   2
2 ) over the Lie algebra sl(2, C) the following asymptotics “mod O(~ )” exists, too:

                         [Li , Lj ] = (i − j)Li+j + ~A + O(~2 ),

where
                                2 3
                               A≡ (i − i)δij mod HS .
                                3
So generators of qR –conformal symmetries form an approximate representation of
the Virasoro algebra virC for h → 1 in the specified sense.
   In the statement of the theorem the estimations “mod O(~2 )” are interpreted
in the sense of a convergence in the extended Weyl algebra A, and HS denotes the
set of all elements of this algebra, which are realized by Hilbert-Schmidt operators
under the strict representation in the Verma modules over the Lie algebra sl(2, C)
for all sufficiently small values of ~ (otherwords, if πh is the representation of A in
Vh and HS h is the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators in Vh then in the theorem
HS is interpreted as
                                   \
                            lim            πh−1 (HS h ∩πh (A)),
                           ~→0
                                 h0 <h<h0 +~

             1
where h0 =   2   or h0 = 1).
The result of Theorem 3B follows from explicit computations. Let us compute the
commutator [L2 , L−2 ] and estimate it that is enough for the determination of the
                                               9
central charge of the Virasoro algebra. The Verma module Vh is realized in the
space C[z] of polynomials, ξ = z∂z , and generators of qR –conformal symmetries are
defined by expressions written above. Then for h → 21
                                         2
                                                        (ξ+3h−2)2 ξ(ξ−1)
                 [L2 , L−2 ] = (ξ+3h) (ξ+1)(ξ+2)
                                (ξ+2h)(ξ+2h+1) −       (ξ+2h−1)(ξ+2h−2) =
                                    3                         1
                                (ξ+ 2 +3~)2 (ξ+1)(ξ+2)    (ξ− 2 +3~)2 ξ(ξ−1)
                                  (ξ+1+2~)(ξ+2+2~)     −   (ξ−1+2~)(ξ+2~) .

The following estimation “mod O(~2 )” holds (~ in denominators is not excluded
because for the zero value of ~ a representation of the extended Weyl algebra in the
corresponding Verma module is not defined):

            [L2 , L−2 ] ≡(ξ +   3
                                2   + 3~)2 (1 −       2~          2~
                                                    ξ+1+~ )(1 − ξ+2+~ )−

                        (ξ −    1

Extracting the terms of order ~ (because the first term of the order 1 is known) one
receives:

                               +      1
                                     ξ+~ )   − 2~(ξ + 32 )2 ( ξ+1+~
                                                                1
                                                                    +      1
                                                                         ξ+2+~ )    + 12~.

Perform the estimation “mod HS” and obtain:

                8~ + 12~ − 16~ = 4~.

So the “asymptotic” central charge is equal to 8~.
  Analogously, for h → 1

The following estimation “mod O(~2 )” holds (~ in denominators is not excluded

Extracting the terms of order ~ (because the first term of the order 1 is known) one

Perform the estimation “mod HS” and obtain:
                                  ξ−1              ξ+3
                   8~ + 2(ξ + 1)( ξ+~ −           ξ+2+~ )   ∼ 8~ − 4~ = 4~.
                                                  10
So the “asymptotic” central charge is equal to 8~.
Remark 9. The estimation “mod O(~2 )” may be strengthened to “mod O(~n )” for
any finite n (but not to “mod O(~∞ )” in view of the further estimation “mod HS”).
Remark 10. As follows from the results of the second paragraph the change of an
order of estimations gives the zero central charge of the Virasoro algebra.
   Perhaps, the noncommutativity of an order of the estimations “mod O(~n )”
and “mod HS” in the case of qR –conformal symmetries is a partial case of a more
general and fundamental fact of deviations between asymptotical theory of pseu-
dodifferential operators and pseudodifferential calculus on asymptotic manifolds in
sense of [27].
   Note that the result of Theorem 3B contains a strange coincidence of “asymp-
totic” central charges of the Virasoro algebra for h → 12 and h → 1 (namely, c = 8~,
~ → 0). Perhaps, this coincidence may be explaned by the hypothetical suggestion
that for all values of the extremal weight h the Virasoro algebra is presented on a
certain more hidden and unexplicated level universally (i.e. its characteristics do
not depend on h).

                                       Conclusion
   In the paper there are investigated various approximate representations of the
infinite dimensional Z–graded Lie algebras: the Witt algebra of all Laurent polyno-
mial vector fields on a circle and its one-dimensional nontrivial central extension,
the Virasoro algebra, by the infinite dimensional hidden symmetries in the Verma
modules over the Lie algebra sl(2, C). There are considered as asymptotic repre-
sentations “mod O(~n )” and representations up to a class S of operators (compact
operators, Hilbert-Schmidt operators and finite-rank operators) as cases, which
combine both types of approximations (and in these cases an effect of noncommu-
tativity of the order of their realizations is explicated, that perhaps is underlied by
a more general fundamental fact of deviations between the asymptotical theory of
pseudodifferential operators and the pseudodifferential calculus on the asymptotic
manifolds in sense of [27]). Some applications of the discussed problems to the
applied problems of information technologies (an organization of the information
transmission in integrated videocognitive interactive systems for accelerated non-
verbal computer and telecommunications) were investigated in the report [28].
