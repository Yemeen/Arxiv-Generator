                                               Let g be a Lie algebra over a field K. Consider the coadjoint representation ad∗ (g). The

                                             index of g is the minimum of dimensions of stabilisers gα over all covectors α ∈ g∗
                                                                                   ind g = min∗ dim gα .
                                                                                            α∈g

                                             The definition of index goes back to Dixmier [3, 11.1.6]. This notion is important in Repre-
                                             sentation Theory and also in Invariant Theory. By Rosenlicht’s theorem [12], generic orbits
                                             of an arbitrary action of a linear algebraic group on an irreducible algebraic variety are
                                             separated by rational invariants; in particular, ind g = tr.deg K(g∗ )G .
                                                The index of a reductive algebra equals its rank. Computing the index of an arbitrary Lie
                                             algebra seems to be a wild problem. However, there is a number of interesting results for
                                             several classes of non-reductive subalgebras of reductive Lie algerbas. For instance, parabolic
                                             subalgebras and their “relatives” (nilpotent radicals, seaweeds) are considered in [4], [8], [13].
                                             The centralisers of elements form another interesting class of subalgebras. The last topic is
                                             closely related to the theory of integrable Hamiltonian systems.
                                                Let G be a semisimple Lie group (complex or real), g = Lie G, and Gx an orbit of a
                                             covector x ∈ g∗ . Let gx denote the stabiliser of x. It is well-known that the orbit Gx
                                             possesses a G-invariant symplectic structure. There is a family of commuting with respect
                                             to a Poisson bracket polynomial functions on g∗ constructed by the argument shift method
                                             such that its restriction to Gx contains 21 dim(Gx) algebraically independent functions if and
                                             only if ind gx = ind g, [1].
                                             Conjecture (Élashvili). Let g be a reductive Lie algebra. Then ind gx = ind g for each
                                             covector x ∈ g∗ .
                                             Recall that if g is reductive, then the g-modules g∗ and g are isomorphic. In particular, it is
                                             enough to prove the “index conjecture” for stabilisers of vectors x ∈ g.
                                                Given x ∈ g, let x = xs + xn be the Jordan decomposition. Then gx = (gxs )xn . The
                                             subalgebra gxs is reductive and contains a Cartan subalgebra of g. Hence, ind gxs = ind g =
                                             rk g. Thus, a verification of the ”index conjecture” is reduced to the computation of ind gxn
                                             for nilpotent elements xn ∈ g. Clearly, we can restrict ourselves to the case of simple g.
                                                Note that if x is a regular element, then the stabiliser gx is commutative and of dimension
                                             rk g. The “index conjecture” was proved for subregular nilpotents and nilpotents of height
                                             2 [9], and also for nilpotents of height 3 [10]. (The height of a nilpotent element e is the
                                             maximal number m such that (ad e)m 6= 0.) Recently, Élashvili’s conjecture was proved by
                                             Charbonnel [2] for K = C.
                                                In the present article, we prove in an elementary way, that for any nilpotent element e ∈ g
                                             of a simple classical Lie algebra the index of ge equals the rank of g. We assume that the
                                                                                             1
ground field K contains at least k elements, where k is the number of Jordan blocks of a
nilpotent element e ∈ g. For the orthogonal and symplectic algebras, it is also assumed that
char K 6= 2. Note that if a reductive Lie algebra g does not contain exceptional ideals, then
gxs has the same property. Thus, the “index conjecture” is proved for the direct sums of
classical algebras.
   By Vinberg’s inequality, which is presented in [9, Sect. 1], we have ind gx ≥ ind g for each
element x ∈ g∗ . It remains to prove the opposite inequality. To this end, it suffices to find
α ∈ (gx )∗ such that the dimension of its stabiliser in gx is at most rk g. For g = gl(V ) and
g = sp(V ), we explicitly indicate such a point α ∈ g∗e . In case of the orthogonal algebra, the
proof is partially based on induction.
   In the last two sections, K is assumed to be algebraically closed and of characteristic zero.
It is shown that the stabilisers (ge )α constructed for g = gl(V ) and g = sp(V ) are generic
stabilisers for the coadjoint representation of ge . For the orthogonal case, we give an example
of a nilpotent element e ∈ so8 such that the coadjoint action of ge has no generic stabiliser.
Similar results for parabolic and seaweed subalgebras of simple Lie algebras were obtained by
Panyushev and also by Tauvel and Yu. In [13] there is an example of a parabolic subalgebra
of so8 having no generic stabilisers for the coadjoint representation. The affirmative answer
for series A and C is obtained by Panyushev in [11].
   In the last section, we consider the commuting variety of ge and its relationship with the
commuting variety of triples of matrices.

                                       1. Preliminaries
   Suppose g is a simple classical Lie algebra or a general linear algebra. Let e ∈ g be
a nilpotent element and z(e) its centraliser in g. Note that there is no essential difference
between g = gl(V ) and g = sl(V ). However, the first case is more suitable for calculations. In
case of orthogonal and symplectic algebras, we need some facts from the theory of symmetric
spaces.
   Let ( , )V be a non-degenerate symmetric or skew-symmetric form on a finite dimensional
vector space V given by a matrix J, i.e., (v, w)V = v t Jw, where the symbol t stands for the
transpose. The elements of gl(V ) preserving ( , )V are exactly the fixed vectors gl(V )σ of the
involution σ(ξ) = −Jξ t J −1 . There is the gl(V )σ -invariant decomposition gl(V ) = gl(V )σ ⊕g1 .
The elements of g1 multiply the form ( , )V by −1, i.e., (ξv, w)V = (v, ξw)V for every
v, w ∈ V .
   Set g = gl(V )σ , and let e ∈ g be a nilpotent element. Denote by z(e) and zgl(e) the
centralisers of e in g and gl(V ), respectively. Since σ(e) = e, σ acts on zgl(e). Clearly,
zgl(e)σ = z(e). This yields the z(e)-invariant decomposition zgl(e) = z(e) ⊕ z1 . Given α ∈
zgl(e)∗ , let α̃ denote its restriction to z(e).

Proposition 1. Suppose α ∈ zgl(e)∗ and α(z1) = 0. Then z(e)α̃ = zgl(e)α ∩ z(e).
                                                 2
Proof. Take ξ ∈ z(e). Since [ξ, z1 ] ⊂ z1 , α([ξ, z(e)]) = 0 if and only if α([ξ, zgl(e)]) = 0. In
particular, z(e)α̃ = z(e)α .                                                                    

  Suppose h is a Lie algebra and τ ∈ Auth an involution, which defines the decomposition
h = h0 ⊕ h1 . Each point γ ∈ h∗0 determines a skew-symmetric 2-form γ̂ on h1 by γ̂(ξ, η) =
γ([ξ, η]).

Lemma 1. In the above notation, we have ind h ≤ ind h0 + min∗ dim(Ker γ̂).
                                                                       γ∈h0

Proof. Consider γ as a function on h, which is equal to zero on h1 . Then hγ = (h0 )γ ⊕
(hγ ∩ h1 ) = (h0 )γ ⊕ (Ker γ̂). We have dim(h0 )γ = ind h0 for generic points (= points of
some Zariski open subset U1 ⊂ h∗0 ). The points of h∗0 , where Ker γ̂ has the minimal possible
dimension, form another open subset, say U2 ⊂ h∗0 . For the points of the intersection U1 ∩U2 ,
the dimension of the stabiliser in h equals the required sum.                               

                               2. General linear algebra
   Consider a nilpotent element e ∈ gl(V ), where V is an n-dimensional vector space over K.
Denote by z(e) the centraliser of e. Let us show that the index of z(e) equals n.
   Let k be a number of Jordan blocks of e and W ⊂ V a k-dimensional complement of Im e
in V . Denote by di + 1 the dimension of i-th Jordan block. Choose a basis w1 , w2 , . . . , wk in
W , where wi is a generator of an i-th Jordan block, i.e., the vectors esi wi with 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
0 ≤ si ≤ di form a basis of V . Let ϕ ∈ z(e). Since ϕ(es wi ) = es ϕ(wi ), the map ϕ is
completely determined by its values on wi , i = 1, . . . , k. Each value ϕ(wi ) can be written as
                                     X j,s
                            ϕ(wi ) =     ci es wj , where cj,si ∈ K.                           (1)
                                       j,s

That is, ϕ is completely determined by the coefficients cj,s  i = cj,s
                                                                   i (ϕ). Note that ϕ ∈ z(e)

preserves the space of each Jordan block if and only if ci (ϕ) = 0 for i 6= j.
  The centraliser z(e) has a basis {ξij,s}, where

We have α(ξij,s) = ai if i = j, s = di and zero otherwise.

Theorem 1. The stabiliser z(e)α of α in z(e) consist of all maps preserving the Jordan
blocks, i.e., z(e)α is the linear span of the vectors ξii,s .

The element ϕ lies in z(e)α if and only if α([ϕ, ξij,b]) = 0 for all ξij,b.
   Note that if ϕ preserves the Jordan blocks, i.e., cj,s i = 0 for i 6= j, then α([ϕ, z(e)] = 0.
Let us show that z(e)α contains no other elements. Assume that cj,s         i 6= 0 for some i 6= j. We
have three different possibilities: di < dj , di = dj and di > dj .
   If dj ≤ di , then put ξ(wj ) = e(di −s) wi and ξ(wt ) = 0 for t 6= j. It should be noted
that 0 ≤ s ≤ dj ≤ di , hence the expression e(di −s) is well defined. One has to check
that edj +1 (ξ(wj )) = 0. Adding the powers of e, we get edj +1 (ξ(wj )) = edj +1+di −s wi =
                                                             j,dj −di +s
edj −s (edi +1 wi ) = 0. We have α([ϕ, ξ]) = ai · cj,s
                                                   i − aj · ci           . In case dj = di , we obtain
               j,s
(ai − aj ) · ci 6= 0. If dj > di , then s > dj − di + s. Choose the minimal s such that cj,s    i 6= 0.
                                            j,s
For this choice, we get α([ϕ, ξ]) = ai · ci 6= 0.
   Suppose now that dj > di and s is the minimal number such that cj,s           i 6= 0. Set ξ(wj ) =
e(dj −s)wi and ξ(wt ) = 0 for t 6= j. As in the previous case, we have 0 ≤ s ≤ dj . In particular,
dj − s ≥ 0, (dj + 1 + dj − s) > di + 1 and, thereby, edj +1 (ξ(wj )) = 0. We obtain
                                                                 j,di −dj +s

                                                                                        i 6= 0.

       j,di −dj +s
Here ci              = 0, since di − dj + s < s.                                                             

Corollary. The index of z(e) equals n.

Proof. The stabiliser z(e)α consist of all maps preserving Jordan blocks. In particular, it has
dimension n. Hence, ind z(e) ≤ n. On the other hand, it follows from Vinberg’s inequality
that ind z(e) ≥ n = rk gl(V ).                                                               

  Let us give another proof of the inequality ind z(e) ≤ n.

Example 1. Let e ∈ gln be a nilpotent element and h = z(e) the centraliser of e. We may
assume that the first Jordan block of e is of maximal dimension. Then V = Vd1 +1 ⊕ Voth
and e = e1 + e2 , where Vd1 +1 is the space of the first Jordan block and Voth is the space
of all other Jordan blocks; e1 ∈ gld1 +1 , e2 ∈ gln−d1 −1 . Let τ ∈ gl(V ) be the conjugation
by a diagonal matrix of order two such that gl(V )τ = gld1 +1 ⊕ gln−d1 −1 . The involution
τ acts on h = z(e) and induces the decomposition h = h0 ⊕ h1 , where h0 = z(e1 ) ⊕ z(e2 )
(the centralisers are considered in the algebras gld1 +1 and gln−d1 −1 , respectively). Assume
that the “index conjecture” is true for all m < n; in particular, ind z(e2 ) = n − d1 − 1.
The subalgebra z(e1 ) is commutative and its index equals d1 + 1. According to Lemma 1,
ind z(e) ≤ ind (z(e1 ) ⊕ z(e2 )) + min∗ dim(Ker γ̂) ≤ n + min ∗ dim(Ker γ̂). Now, we make a
                                        γ∈h0                                   γ∈z(e1 )

   In this section g = sp2n = sp(V ), where V in an 2n-dimensional vector space over K.
As above, e ∈ sp2n is a nilpotent element and z(e) ⊂ g is the centraliser of e. Let {wi }
be generators of Jordan blocks associated with e. We may assume that the space of each
even-dimensional Jordan block is orthogonal to the space of all other Jordan blocks. If di is
even, then the restriction of sp2n -invariant form ( , )V on the space of i-th Jordan block is
zero. One can choose generators {wi } such that the odd-dimensional blocks are partitioned
in pairs (i, i′ ), where i′ is the number of the unique Jordan block which is not orthogonal to
the i-th one. Note that di′ = di .
   Let zgl(e) be the centraliser of e in gl2n . Recall that z(e) = zgl(e)σ ⊕ z1 , where σ is an
involutive automorphism of gl2n . For elements of zgl(e) we use notation introduced in the
previous section.
   Let α ∈ zgl(e)∗ be a function determined just like in the previous case:
                             α(ϕ) = a1 · c1,d
                                          1

                                                                                k

ai = −ai .

Lemma 2. In the above notation, we have α(z1 ) = 0.
Proof. Assume that there is ψ ∈ z1 such that α(ψ) 6= 0. Then there is a non-zero coefficient
ci,d
 i
    i
      of ψ. Recall that σ(ψ) = −ψ. The element ψ multiplies the sp2n -invariant skew-
symmetric form ( , )V by −1, in particular, (ψ(wi ), v)V = (wi , ψ(v))V for each vector v ∈ V .
Clearly, ψ(wi ) and wi have to be orthogonal with respect to the skew-symmetric form. If di
is odd, then (wi , edi wi )V 6= 0, hence, ci,d
                                           i
                                              i
                                                = 0. If on the contrary di is even, then
                                                                              ′
           ci,d  di                                                       i ,di
            i (e wi , wi′ )V = (ψ(wi ), wi′ )V = (wi , ψ(wi′ ))V = ci′ (wi , e wi′ )V =
               i                                                                       di
                                                     ′                           ′
                                         = (−1)di cii′ ,di (edi wi , wi′ )V = cii′ ,di (edi wi , wi′ )V .

pairs of odd-dimensional blocks

  Denote by α̃ the restriction of α to z(e).

Theorem 2. The dimension of the stabiliser z(e)α̃ = zgl(e)α ∩ sp2n equals n.
Proof. The stabiliser of α in zgl(e) consist of all maps preserving the spaces of the Jordan
blocks. By Proposition 1, z(e)α̃ = zgl(e)α ∩ z(e). Describe the intersection of zgl(e)α with
the symplectic subalgebra. If wi is a generator of an even-dimensional block, then ξii,s
multiply the skew-symmetric form by (−1)s+1 , i.e., (ξii,s (eb wi ), et wi ) = (−1)s (eb wi , ξii,s(et wi )).
Consider a space of a pair (i, i′ ) of odd-dimensional blocks. Set d := di = di′ . Recall that
(wi , ed wi′ ) = (−1)s (es wi , ed−s wi′ ) = −(wi′ , ed wi ). Since (es wi , ed−s wi′ ) = (−1)s (wi , ed wi′ ),
                                   ′
the elements ξii,s + (−1)s+1 ξii′ ,s preserve the skew-symmetric form, and the elements ξii,s +
          ′
(−1)s ξii′ ,s multiply it by −1. From each even-dimensional block i we get (di + 1)/2 vectors,
and from a pair (i, i′ ) we get di + 1 vectors. Thus the stabiliser of α in the whole of sp2n is
an n-dimensional subalgebra.                                                                                

                                       4. The orthogonal case
   In this section g = son . As above e ∈ son is a nilpotent element, z(e) is the centraliser of
e in g. Let {wi } be generators of Jordan blocks associated with e. We may assume that the
space of each odd-dimensional Jordan block is orthogonal to the space of all other Jordan
blocks. If di is odd, then the restriction of son -invariant form ( , )V on the space of i-th
Jordan block is zero. One can choose generators {wi } such that the even-dimensional blocks
are partitioned in pairs (i, i∗ ), where i∗ is the number of the unique Jordan block which is
not orthogonal to the i-th one. Note that di∗ = di .
   Like the symplectic algebra, the orthogonal algebra is a symmetric subalgebra of gln .
Denote by σ the involution defining it. Since σ(e) = e, we have zgl(e) = z(e) ⊕ z1 similarly
to the symplectic case. If di is even, set i∗ = i. Assume that (wi∗ , edi wi )V = ±1 and
(wi , edi wi )V = 1 for i = i∗ . The algebra z(e) is generated (as a vector space) by the vectors
 j,d −s              ∗
ξi j +ε(i, j, s)ξji ∗,di −s , where ε(i, j, s) = ±1 depending on i, j and s. In its turn, the subspace
                                      j,d −s             ∗
z1 is generated by the vectors ξi j − ε(i, j, s)ξji ∗,di −s . Recall that (es wi , edi −s wi∗ )V 6= 0 if
es wi 6= 0.
   We give some simple examples of linear functions with zero restrictions to z1 . Let ϕ ∈ zgl(e)
                                                                                  j,d
be a linear map defined by Formula (1). Set βi (ϕ) = ci,d    i
                                                               i −1
                                                                    , γi,j (ϕ) = ci j .
Lemma 3. If i = i∗ , j = j ∗ , t 6= t∗ , then functions βi , γi,j − γj,i and γt,t + γt∗ ,t∗ are equal to
zero on z1 .
Proof. Suppose ψ ∈ z1 is defined by Formula (1). Since σ(ψ) = −ψ and (ψ(wi ), ewi )V =
ci,d
 i
    i −1
         (ed1 −1 wi , ewi )V , we have
(ψ(wi ), ewi )V = (wi , ψ(ewi ))V = (wi , eψ(wi ))V = −(ewi , ψ(wi ))V = −ci,d
                                                                           i
                                                                              i −1
                                                                                   (ewi , ed1 −1 wi )V .
The form ( , )V is symmetric and (ewi , edi −1 wi )V 6= 0, hence βi (ψ) = ci,d
                                                                           i
                                                                              i −1
                                                                                   = 0.
  Similarly,

   Let us prove the inequality ind z(e) ≤ rk son by the induction on n. In the following two
cases, the induction argument does not go through. Therefore we consider them separately.
The first case. If e ∈ so2m+1 is a regular nilpotent element, then z(e) is a commutative
m-dimensional algebra.
The second case. Let e ∈ so4d be a nilpotent element with two Jordan blocks of size 2d each.
Set α(ϕ) = c1,2d−2
              1      − c2,2d−2
                         2     , where ϕ is defined by Formula (1). One can easily check that
z(e)α has a basis ξ11,s + (−1)s+1 ξ22,s with 0 ≤ s ≤ 2d − 1 and that dim z(e)α = 2d.
   Order the Jordan blocks of e according to their dimensions d1 ≥ d2 ≥ . . . ≥ dk . Here
di + 1 stands for the dimension of the i-th Jordan block, similarly to the case of gln . Note
that the numbers n and k have the same parity. Assume that k > 1 and if k = 2, then both
Jordan blocks are odd dimensional. Then we have the following three possibilities:
   (1) for some even number 2p < k the restriction of ( , )V to the space of the first 2p
Jordan blocks is non-degenerate;
   (2) the number di is even for i = 1, k and odd for all other i;
   (3) the number di is even if and only if i = 1.
Each of these three possibilities is considered separately. In the first two cases we make an
induction step. In the third one a point α ∈ z(e)∗ is given such that dim z(e)α ≤ rk son .
(1) Suppose the space V2m of the first 2p Jordan blocks has dimension 2m and the restriction
of ( , )V to V2m is non-degenerate. Then V = V2m ⊕ Voth , e = e1 + e2 , where e1 ∈ so2m ,
e2 ∈ son−2m . Let τ be an involution of gln corresponding to these direct sum, i.e., glτn =
gl(V2m )⊕gl(Voth ). Set h = z(e), h0 = z(e)τ . Then h0 = z(e1 )⊕z(e2 ), where the centralisers of
e1 and e2 are taken in so2m and son−2m , respectively. By the inductive hypothesis, ind z(e1 ) =
m, ind z(e2 ) = [n/2] − m. Hence, ind z(e) ≤ [n/2] + min∗ dim(Ker γ̂). To conclude we have
                                                                            γ∈h0
to point out a function γ ∈ h∗0 such that γ̂ is non-degenerate. Recall that the involutions
σ and τ commute with each other, preserve e and determine the decomposition zgl(e) =
(z(e1 ) ⊕ z(e2 ) ⊕ h1 ) ⊕ z1 . If γ(z1 ) = γ(h1 ) = 0, then Ker γ̂ = (h1 ∩ zgl(e)γ ).
   Divide odd-dimensional Jordan blocks into pairs (i, i′ ) (it is assumed that i, i′ ≤ 2p).
Define a point γ by

                                                    i′ ,di′                                          j,d
                                   X                                               X
                     γ(ϕ) =                       (ci         − ci,d
                                                                 i′ ) +
                                                                    i
                                                                                                    cj j ,
                              (i,i′ ), i,i′ ≤2p                           j≤2p, (dj +1)   is even

where ϕ ∈ zgl(e) is given by its coefficients cj,si . The first summand is a sum of (γi,i′ − γi′ ,i )
over pairs of odd-dimensional blocks, the second is the sum of (γj,j + γj ∗ ,j ∗ ) over pairs of
even-dimensional blocks. According to Lemma 3, both summands are identical zeros on z1 .
Moreover, by the definition γ(h1 ) = 0.
   Set j ′ := j for even-dimensional blocks. Assume that an element ψ ∈ h1 determined by (1)
lies in the kernel of γ̂, i.e., γ([ψ, h1 ]) = 0. Then γ([ψ, h]) = γ([ψ, zgl(e)]) = 0. Since ψ ∈ son
                                                                 7
and ψ 6= 0, we may assume that cj,s
                                i 6= 0 for some j > 2p ≥ i. We have
                                             j ′ ,dj ′
                                    γ([ψ, ηi             ]) = ±cj,s
                                                                i 6= 0.

Thus we have proved that γ̂ is non-degenerate and ind z(e) ≤ [n/2].
(2) Consider a decomposition V = Voth ⊕ Vdk +1 , where the second summand is the space
of the smallest (odd-dimensional) Jordan block and the first one is the space of all other
blocks. As above e = e1 + e2 , where nilpotent element e2 corresponds to the smallest (odd-
dimensional) Jordan block. We define an involution τ , algebras z(e1 ), z(e2 ), h0 and a subspace
h1 in the same way as in case (1). By the inductive hypothesis ind z(e1 ) = [(n − dk − 1)/2],
ind z(e2 ) = dk /2. Hence ind h0 = n/2 − 1. By Lemma 1, ind z(e) ≤ ind h0 + min∗ dim(Ker γ̂).
                                                                                          γ∈h0
Let γ be the following function
                                                                  k−1

                                                                           i ,
                                                                              i


                                                                  i=2

where ϕ is given by formula (1). The first summand is β1 , the second summand is a sum of
(γj,j + γj ∗ ,j ∗ ) over pairs of even-dimensional blocks. Due to Lemma 3, γ(z1 ) = 0. Suppose
ψ ∈ h1 is given by its coefficients cj,s    i . Then

                                    γ([ξ1k,b, ψ]) = c1,d1 −1−b

                                                     k         ,
                                         k,b         i,di −b
                                    γ([ξi , ψ]) = ck            for 1 < i < k.
One can see that the kernel of γ̂ is one-dimensional and generated by (ξk1,d1 − ξ1k,dk ). Hence,
ind z(e) ≤ [n/2] − 1 + 1 = [n/2].
(3) In this case n and k are odd, and e has a unique odd-dimensional Jordan block whose
size is maximal. Assume that k = 2m + 1. Enumerate the Jordan blocks by integers ranging
from −m to m. Let the unique odd-dimensional block has number zero. Suppose that pairs
of blocks (−i, i) and (−j, j) are orthogonal to each other if i 6= ±j, and dimensions of Jordan
blocks are increasing from −m to 0 and decreasing from 0 to m, i.e., if |i| ≤ |j|, then di ≥ dj .
Note that di = d−i . Such enumeration is shown on Picture 1. Choose the generators wi of
Jordan blocks such that i(wi , edi w−i )V = |i| for i 6= 0 and (w0 , ed0 w0 )V = 1.

  Suppose ϕ ∈ zgl(e) is given by Formula (1). Consider the following point α ∈ zgl(e)∗ :
                                                      m

                                       α(ϕ) =              ci,d
                                                            i−1 .
                                                               i


                                                 i=−m+1

One can check by direct computation that ci,d      i−1 (ψ) = −c−i
                                                      i              1−i
                                                                         (ψ) for each ψ ∈ z1 and,
                                    ∗
hence, α(z1 ) = 0. Let α̃ ∈ z(e) be the restriction of α. Let us describe the stabiliser
                                                    i,d −s      i+1,d    −s
z(e)α̃ = zgl(e)α ∩ z(e). Note that α([ϕ, ξij,s]) = cj−1j (ϕ) − cj i+1 (ϕ).

Lemma 4. Suppose ϕ ∈ z(e) and ad∗ (ϕ)α = 0. Then cj,s  j,s
                                                  i = ci (ϕ) = 0 for i < j.

Proof. Assume that the statement is wrong and take a maximal i for which there are j > i
                                                            −i,d −d +s
and s such that cj,s
                   i   6= 0. Because ϕ preserves ( , )V , c−j i j      = ±cj,s
                                                                            i  6= 0. Hence,
−j ≤ i < j, j > 0, |i| ≤ j and di ≥ dj . Moreover, −j < (i + 1) ≤ j and di+1 ≥ dj . Evidently,
                                                i+1,d −s
di+1 − s ≥ dj − s ≥ 0 and there is an element ξj i+1 ∈ zgl(e). We have
                                       i+1,di+1 −s
                           0 = α([ϕ, ξj              ]) = cj,s  j+1,δ  j,s
                                                           i − ci+1 = ci .
                                                                   j+1,b
Here we do not give a precise value of δ. Anyway all coefficients ci+1   are zeros, because
j + 1 > i + 1 > i. We get a contradiction. Thus the lemma is proved.                     
   Let us say that ϕ ∈ zgl(e) has a step l whenever cj,s
                                                      i (ϕ) = 0 for j 6= i + l. Each vector
ϕ ∈ zgl(e) can be represented as a sum ϕ = ϕ−2m + ϕ−2m+1 + . . . + ϕ2m−1 + ϕ2m , where
the step of ϕl equals l. The notion of the step is well-defined on z(e), due to an equality
(−i) − (−j) = j − i. From the definition of α, one can deduce that α(ϕl , ϕt ) 6= 0 only if
l + t = 1. The stabiliser z(e)α is a direct sum of its subspaces Φl , consisting of elements
having step l. As we have seen, Φl = ∅ if l > 0. It is remains to describe elements with
non-positive steps.
Example 2. Let us show that dim Φ0 ≤ d0 /2. Suppose ϕ ∈ Φ0 , ϕ 6= 0 and ϕ(w0 ) = 0.
Take a minimal by the absolute value i such that ϕ(wi ) 6= 0. Since ϕ ∈ son , we have also
ϕ(w−i ) 6= 0. Assume that i > 0 and a coefficient ci,s       i of ϕ is non-zero. Then |i − 1| < i,
                                  i,di −s
di−1 ≥ di , there is an element ξi−1 ∈ zgl(e) and 0 = α([ξ, ϕ]) = ci,s          i−1,s  i,s
                                                                          i − ci−1 = ci . Hence,
if ϕ(w0 ) = 0, then also ϕ = 0. Thus, a vector ϕ ∈ Φ0 is entirely determined by its value on
w0 . In its turn ϕ(w0 ) = c1 ew0 + c3 e3 w0 + . . . + cd0 −1 ed0 −1 w0 .
Lemma 5. If q = 2l or q = 2l − 1, where 0 < l ≤ m, then dim Φ−q ≤ (dl + 1)/2.
Proof. Similarly to the previous example, we show that if ϕ ∈ Φ−q and ϕ(wl ) = 0, then
also ϕ = 0. Since ϕ ∈ son , if ϕ(wi ) 6= 0, then also ϕ(wq−i ) 6= 0. Suppose ϕ(wj ) 6= 0 for
some j. If j < l, then j − q ≥ l, but ϕ(wl ) = 0, hence j > l. Find the minimal j > l
such that ϕ(wj ) 6= 0. Suppose cjj−q,s = cjj−q,s(ϕ) 6= 0. We have −j < −l ≤ j − q − 1 < j,
                                                                        j,dj−q −s
dj ≤ dj−q−1, dj−q − s ≥ 0. Hence, there is an element ξ := ξj−q−1                 ∈ zgl(e). As above
                    j−q,s     j−q−1,δ      j−q,s
0 = α([ξ, ϕ, ]) = cj      − cj−1       = cj        (we do not give a precise value of δ, anyway,
ϕ(wj−1) = 0, since l ≤ j − 1 < j). To conclude we describe possible values ϕ(wl ). If q = 2l,
then ϕ(wl ) = c0 w−l + c2 e2 w−l + . . . + cdl edl w−l . In case q = 2l − 1 we get an equation on

Theorem 3. Suppose e ∈ son is a nilpotent element. Then ind z(e) = rk son = [n/2].
Proof. If possibility (3) takes place, i.e., only one Jordan block of e is odd-dimensional and

it is also maximal, then, as we have seen, z(e)α̃ =      Φ−q . Moreover, dim Φq is at most half

   In cases (1) and (2) the inequality ind z(e) ≤ rk son was proved by induction.
   If none of these three possibilities takes place, then either k = 1 and e is a regular nilpotent
element, or k = 2 and both Jordan blocks of e are even-dimensional. These two cases have
been considered separately.                                                                      

                                       5. Generic points
   In this section we assume that K is algebraically closed and of characteristic zero. Suppose
we have a linear action of a Lie algebra g on a vector space V .
   Definition. A vector x ∈ V (a subalgebra gx ) is called a generic point (a generic sta-
biliser), if for every point y ∈ U ⊂ V of some open in Zariski topology subset U algebras gy
and gx are conjugated in g.
It is well known that generic points exist for any linear action of a reductive Lie algebra.
   It is proved in [5, §1] that a subalgebra gx is a generic stabiliser if and only if V = V gx +gx,
where V gx is the subspace of all vectors of V invariant under gx .
   Tauvel and Yu have noticed that in case of a coadjoint representation gx = (g/gx )∗ =
Ann(gx ), (g∗ )gx = Ann([gx , g]). From this observation they have deduced a simple and
useful criterion.
Theorem 4. [13, Corollaire 1.8.] Let g be a Lie algebra and x ∈ g∗ . The subalgebra gx is a
generic stabiliser of the coadjoint representation of g if and only if [gx , g] ∩ gx = {0}.
Unfortunately, the authors of [13] were not aware of the aforementioned Élashvili’s result
and have proved it anew.
  Let e ∈ gln be a nilpotent element and z(e) the centraliser of e. Set h = z(e)α , where
α ∈ z(e)∗ is the same as in Section 2.
Proposition 2. There is an h-invariant decomposition z(e) = h ⊕ m, where m is generated
by the vectors ξij,s with i 6= j.
Proof. Recall that h is generated by the vectors ξii,s . The inclusion [h, m] ⊂ m follows
immediately from the equality
                                                t,s+b

                                                     0 otherwise.

  There is a similar decomposition in the case of symplectic algebras. Let e ∈ sp(V ) ⊂ gl(V ).
Denote by zgl(e) and zsp(e) the centralisers of e in gl(V ) and sp(V ), respectively. We use
notation of Section 3. Suppose zgl(e) = h ⊕ m. Evidently, this decomposition is σ-invariant
and zsp(e) = hσ ⊕ mσ , where hσ = zsp(e)α̃ .
Theorem 5. The Lie algebras zgl(e)α and zsp(e)α̃ constructed in Sections 2 and 3 in cases
of general linear and symplectic algebras are generic stabilisers of the coadjoint actions of
zgl(e) and zsp(e).
Proof. Let us verify the condition of Theorem 4. Since [h, zgl(e)] = [h, m] ⊂ m, we have
[h, zgl(e)] ∩ h = 0. Similarly, [hσ , zsp(e)] ⊂ mσ .                                  
  In case of orthogonal algebras it can happen that a generic stabiliser of the coadjoint
action of z(e) does not exist.
Example 3. Let e ∈ so8 be a subregular nilpotent element. Then it has two Jordan blocks of
dimensions 3 and 5. Choose the generators w1 , w2 of Jordan blocks such that (w1 , e2 w1 )V =
(w2 , e4 w2 )V = 1. The dimension of z(e) is 6 and z(e) has a three-dimensional center, generated
by the vectors e, e3 = ξ22,3 and ϕ3 = ξ12,4 − ξ21,2 . Since ind z(e) = 4, we have dim z(e)α = 4 for
points of some open subset U ⊂ z(e)∗ .
  Assume that a generic stabiliser of the coadjoint action of z(e) exists and denote it by f.
Evidently, f contains the center of z(e). Consider an element ϕ2 = ξ12,3 + ξ21,1 ∈ z(e). Clearly,
the subspace [ϕ2 , z(e)] is a linear span of e3 and ϕ3 . In particular, it is contained in the
center of z(e), and, hence, in f. Hence, [ϕ2 , f] ⊂ f, and, by Theorem 4, f ⊂ z(e)ϕ2 . Since
dim z(e)ϕ2 = 4, we have f = z(e)ϕ2 . On the other hand, z(e)ϕ2 = he, e3 , ϕ3 , ϕ2 iK is a normal,
but not a central subalgebra of z(e).
  Consider the embedding so8 ⊂ so9 as the stabiliser of the first basis vector in K9 . By
a similar argument one can show that a generic stabiliser does not exist for the coadjoint
action of zso9 (e) either.

                                     6. Commuting varieties
   Let g be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero. A closed
subset Y = {(x, y)|x, y ∈ g, [x, y] = 0} ⊂ (g × g) is called the commuting variety of the
algebra g. The question of whether Y is irreducible or not is of a great interest. In case of
a reductive algebra g the commuting variety Y is irreducible and coincides with the closure
of G(a, a), where a ⊂ g is a Cartan subalgebra and G is a connected algebraic group with
Lie G = g.
   Let e ∈ gln be a nilpotent element and z(e) the centraliser of e. We use notation introduced
in Section 2. Set h = z(e)α . Consider a subalgebra t ⊂ z(e) generated by the vectors ξii,0 .
Evidently, t ⊂ h. Moreover, since [ξij,s , ti ξii,0 + tj ξjj,0] = (tj − ti )ξij,s, the algebra h coincides
with the normaliser (= centraliser) of t in z(e). Hence, h coincides with its normaliser in
z(e).
                                                   11
   Let Z(e) be the identity component of the centraliser of e in GLn . Then Y0 = Z(e)(h, h)
is an irreducible component of Y of maximal dimension. As in the reductive case, Y is
irreducible if and only if Y0 = Y . It is known that if a nilpotent element e has at most two
Jordan blocks, then Y is irreducible [7]. In the general case, the statement is not true, since
it would lead to the irreducibility of the commuting varieties of triples of matrices.
Example 4. Assume that Y0 = Y for all nilpotent elements e ∈ glm with m ≤ n. Consider
the set of triples of commuting matrices
                C3 = {(A, B, C)|A, B, C ∈ gln , [A, B] = [A, C] = [B, C] = 0}.
Let a ⊂ gln be a subalgebra of diagonal matrices. Clearly, GLn (a, a, a) is an irreducible
component of C3 . Let us prove by induction that it coincides with C3 . There is nothing
to prove for n = 1. Let n > 1. We show that each triple (A, B, C) of commuting matrices
is contained in the closure GLn (a, a, a). Without loss of generality, we may assume that
A, B, C ∈ sln . Let A = As + An be the Jordan decomposition of A. If As 6= 0, consider the
centraliser z(As ) of As in gln . Clearly, A, B, C ∈ z(As ) and z(As ) is a sum of several algebras
glni with strictly smaller dimension. We may assume that a ⊂ z(As ). Then, by the inductive
hypothesis
                            (A, B, C) ∈ Z(As )(a, a, a) ⊂ GLn (a, a, a).
  Suppose now that all three elements A, B, C are nilpotent and at least one of them, say A, is
not regular. Consider the centraliser z(A) ⊂ gln . We have assumed that Y0 = Y , i.e., the pair
(B, C) lies in the closure of Z(A)(h, h). It will be enough to show that (A, h, h) ⊂ GLn (a, a, a).
Let x ∈ t ⊂ h be a non-central semisimple element. Then A ∈ (gln )x and h ⊂ (gln )x . Once
again we can make an induction step, passing to a subalgebra (gln )x .
  If all three elements A, B, C are regular nilpotent, then there is a non-trivial linear com-
bination A′ of them, which is non-regular. In particular, the triple (A, B, C) is equivalent
under the action of GLn to some other triple (A′ , B ′ , C ′ ) of commuting nilpotent matrices.
   It is known that for n > 31 the variety C3 is reducible, see [6]. Hence, the commuting
variety Y is certainly reducible for some nilpotent elements. It will be interesting to find
minimal (in some sense) nilpotent elements for which Y is reducible and/or describe some
classes of nilpotent elements for which Y is irreducible.
