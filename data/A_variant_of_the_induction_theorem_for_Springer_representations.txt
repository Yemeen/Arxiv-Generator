                                                 Let G be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field k, and
                                            W the Weyl group of G. For a unipotent element u ∈ G, let Bu be the variety
                                            of Borel subgroups containing u. According to Springer [Sp2], Lusztig [L1], W
                                            acts naturally on the l-adic cohomology group H n (Bu ) = H n (Bu , Q̄l ), the so-called
                                            Springer representations of W . Assume that k = C, or the characteristic p of k
                                                                                  odd
                                            is good. Then L it is2nknown that H (Bu ) = 0. We consider the graded W -module
                                               ∗
                                            H (Bu ) = n≥0 H (Bu ). Let L be a Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup of G.
                                            Let WL be the Weyl group of L, which is naturally a subgroup of W . If u ∈ L,
                                            the variety BuL is defined by replacing G by L, and we have a graded WL -module
                                            H ∗ (BuL ).
                                                 Lusztig proved in [L3] an induction theorem for Springer representations, which
                                            describes the W -module structure of H ∗ (Bu ) in terms of the WL -module structure of
                                            H ∗ (BuL ), in the case where u ∈ L. However in this theorem, the information on the
                                            graded W -module structure is eliminated. In this paper, we try to recover partly
                                            the graded W -module   L structure, i.e., for a fixed positive integer e, we consider the
                                                                                 2n
                                            W -modules Ve,k =        n≡k mod e H (Bu ) for k = 0, . . . , e − 1. Let G be a simple
                                            group modulo center defined over C. We show, under a certain choice of L, u and e,
                                            that the W -module Ve,k can be described in terms of the graded WL -module H ∗ (BuL )
                                              ∗
                                               A part of this work was done during the author’s stay in CIB in Lausanne in June 2005. The
                                            author is grateful for their hospitality.
                                                                                            1

with some additional data. In particular, we see that dim Ve,k is independent of the
choice of k.
     In the case where u = 1, H ∗ (Bu ) is isomorphic, as a graded W -module, to the
coinvariant algebra of W . In this case Ve,k has been studied by many authors, by
Stembridge [St] for e corresponding to the regular elements in W , by Morita and
Nakajima [MN1] for W = Sn with e such that 1 ≤ e ≤ n, and by Bonnafé, Lehrer
and Michel [BLM] for complex reflection groups W in the most general framework.
Our result partly covers the result of [BLM]. For general u 6= 1, Morita and Nakajima
[MN2] considered certain types of unipotent elements for G = GLn , which is a special
case of ours.
     The proof of the induction theorem in [L3] is done by passing to the finite field
Fq , and using a certain specialization argument q 7→ 1 together with the properties of
Deligne-Lusztig’s virtual character RT (1). Our argument is a variant of that in [L3].
We use a specialization q 7→ ζ, where ζ is a primitive e-th root of unity. Thus our
argument is closely related to the values of Green functions at root of unity. In the
case where u is a regular unipotent element in L, we obtain an explicit formula for
such values, which is regarded as a generalization of the result by Lascoux, Leclerc
and Thibon [LLT] for the case of Green polynomials of GLn .


                      1. The statement of the main result

      1.1. Let k be an algebraic closure of a finite field with ch(k) = p > 0 or the
complex number field C. Let G be a connected reductive group G over k. Let B be
the variety of Borel subgroups of G, and W the Weyl group of G. For any g ∈ G,
put Bg = {B ′ ∈ B | g ∈ B ′ }. We consider the Springer representations of W on
H n (Bg , Q̄l ) (or on H n (Bg , C) in the case where k = C).
      Let L be a Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup P of G. The Weyl group WL
of L is naturally identified with a subgroup of W . Let BL be the variety of Borel
subgroups of L. For a unipotent element u ∈ L, we consider BuL = {B ′ ∈ BL | u ∈
B ′ }. Thus we have a WL -module H n (BuL , Q̄l ), and a W -module H n (Bu , Q̄l ). The
induction theorem for Springer representations asserts that
                    X                                X                        
(1.1.1)                (−1)n H n (Bu , Q̄l ) = IndW
                                                  WL   (−1)n H n (BuL , Q̄l )
                n≥0                               n≥0


as virtual W -modules.
Remark 1.2. The induction theorem was stated in [AL], with a brief indication
of the proof, in the case where k = C, and was proved in [L3] for any k. Note
that if p is good, the unipotent classes in G are parametrized in the same way
as the case of k = C, independent of p. Moreover in that case, it is known that
H n (Bu , Q̄l ) = 0 for odd n. Then the algorithm of computing Green functions implies
that the W -module structure of H n (Bu , Q̄l ) is independent of p. Thus by a general
principle H n (Bu , Q̄l ) is isomorphic to the W -module H n (Bu′ , C), where u′ , Bu′ are
the corresponding objects in the algebraic group GC over C. In what follows, we
express H n (Bu , Q̄l ) or H n (Bu′ , C) by H n (Bu ) by abbreviation.

     1.3. Assume that k = C. We consider the following variant of the induction
theorem. Let Γ be a cyclic group L    of order e generated by a. Let ζ be a primitive
e-th root of unity in C. Let V = n≥0 Vn be a graded W -module. Then V turns
out to be a Γ × W -module by defining the action of Γ on V by ax = ζ n x for x ∈ Vn .
We denote by V (ζ) the thus obtained Γ × W -module V .           L
     For u ∈ L, we consider the graded WL -module H ∗ (BuL ) = n≥0 H 2n (BuL ), where
the degree n part isLgiven by H 2n (BuL ), and similarly we consider the graded W -
module H ∗ (Bu ) =            2n
                        n≥0 H (Bu ). Let Γ be as before. We choose Γ such that
Γ ⊂ NW (WL ), and consider the semidirect product W       fL = Γ ⋉ WL . We assume
that the WL -module H n (BuL ) can be extended to a W  fL -module for each n. (In the
case where a ∈ ZW (WL ), we have W     fL = Γ × WL . In this case, one can choose
a trivial extension to W fL , i.e., we may asssume that Γ (⊂ W    fL ) acts trivially on
H ∗ (BuL ).) Then one can define a Γ × W   fL -module H ∗ (BL ) as above, replacing WL
                                                             u
    f                             ∗  L (ζ)
by WL , which we denote by H (Bu ) . (When we need to distinguish the group Γ
                           fL from the subgroup of W
as the first factor of Γ × W                           fL , we write the latter as Γ0 .)
                                                                                       (ζ)
Γ × W -module H ∗ (Bu )(ζ) is defined as before. Put V (ζ) = H ∗ (BuL )(ζ) , and let Vn
be the degree n-part of V (ζ) . Let us consider the induced W -module
                                             M
                            IndWWL V
                                     (ζ)
                                         =         w ⊗ V (ζ) .
                                           w∈W/WL


Then IndWWL V
              (ζ)
                  turns out to be a Γ × W -module by defining the action of Γ by
                                          (ζ)
b(w ⊗ x) = ζ (wb ⊗ bx) for b ∈ Γ0 , x ∈ Vn , which we denote by Γ -IndW
            n     −1
                                                                       WL V
                                                                            (ζ)
                                                                                .

     1.4.    In the remainder of this paper, we assume that G is simple modulo
center. Let T ⊂ B be a pair of maximal torus and a Borel subgroup of G. Put
W = NG (T )/T . Let L be a Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup P of G containing
B such that L ⊃ T . We have WL = NL (T )/T . Let Φ ⊂ X(T ) be a root system for
G with respect to T , with a simple root system Π (with respect to B), where X(T )
is the character group of T . We denote by ΦL the sub system of Φ corresponding
to L with the simple root system ΠL ⊂ Π. Let Π′ be the set of simple roots
which are orthogonal to ΠL with respect to the standard inner product on V =
R ⊗Z X(T ). We denote by L′ the Levi subgroup containing T corresponding to Π′ .
Let WL′ = NL′ (T )/T be the Weyl group of L′ . Then we have W ⊃ WL × WL′ , and
so WL′ ⊂ NW (WL ).
     We recall here the notion of regular elements of reflection groups due to Springer
[Sp1]. Let W be a reflection group in GL(V ). A vector v ∈ V is called regular if
v is not contained in any reflecting hyperplane in V . An element a ∈ W is called
regular if a has an eigenvector v which is a regular element in V . If av = ζv, with
ζ a primitive e-th root of unity, then the order of a is equal to e ([Sp1, 4.2]). In
particular, if a is regular of order e, there exists an eigenvalue ζ which is a primitive
e-th root of unity.
     The regular elements a ∈ W in the case of classical groups are given as follows
(cf. [Sp1]).
4                                            SHOJI

     Type An−1 . In this case W = Sn and there are two types of regular elements.
     (a) e is a divisor of n, and a is an n/e-product of (disjoint) e-cycles in Sn .
     (b) e is a divisor of n − 1, and a is an (n − 1)/e-product of e-cycles in Sn
     Type Bn . There are two types of regular elements.
     (a) e is an odd divisor of n, and a is an n/e-product of positive cycles of length
e.
      (b) e is an even divisor of 2n, and a is a 2n/e-product of negative cycles of
length e/2.
      Type Dn . In this case there are 4 types of regular elements.
      (a) e is an odd divisor of n, and a is a product of positive cycles of length e.
      (b) e is an odd divisor of n − 1, and a is a product of positive cycle of length 1
and (n − 1)/e positive cycles of length e.
      (c) n is even, and e is an even divisor of n. a is a product of negative cycles of
length e/2.
      (d) e is an even divisor of 2n − 2, and a is a product of (n − 1)/e negative cycles
of length e/2 and one cycle of length 1, which is positive or negative according as
(2n − 2)/e is even or odd.
      Regular elements in the exceptional Weyl groups are listed in [Sp1].
      Returning to the original setting, we consider the subgroups WL , WL′ of W . Let
V ′ be the subspace of V generated by ΠL′ . WL′ is realized as a reflection group on
V ′ . Assume that a is a regular element of WL′ of order e. Let ζ be a primitive e-th
root of unity, and V (a, ζ) the eigensubspace of a in V with eigenvalue ζ. Since a is
regular, V (a, ζ) is not contained in any reflecting hyperplane Hα for α ∈ ΦL′ . We
say that a is L-regular if V (a, ζ) is not contained in any Hα for α ∈ Φ − ΦL . If L is
the torus T , all the regular elements are L-regular. But if L 6= T , regular elements
are not necessarily L-regular. For example, if L is not simple modulo center, regular
elements in WL′ are not L-regular in many cases. In the case where L is simple
modulo center, L-regular elements are classified as follows.
Lemma 1.5. Assume that L is simple modulo center.
    (i) If W is of type An , Bn , Dn , take L such that WL is of the same type as W of
        rank m, and WL′ is of type An−m−1 . Then a regular element of WL′ of type
        (a) in 1.4 is L-regular.
   (ii) If W is of type G2 , F4 or E8 , there does not exist L-regular elements for any
        L 6= T .
  (iii) Assume that W is of type E6 or E7 . Let Π = {α1 , . . . , α7 } (resp. {α1 , . . . , α6 })
        be the set of simple roots in E7 (resp. in E6 ) as in the figure. Take
        ΠL = {αk , αk+1, . . . , α7 } (resp. {αk , αk+1, . . . , α6 }) for k ≥ 3. Then WL′
        is of type Aj or of type Aj + A1 for some j except the case where W is of
        type E7 and ΠL = {α7 }, in which case ΠL′ is of type D5 . In the former case,
        we choose a a regular element of type (a) for type A, and in the latter case,
        we choose a a regular element of type (a) for type D in 1.4, respectively.
        Then a is L-regular.
Proof. If there exists β ∈ Φ − ΦL such that β is orthogonal to VL′ , then any regular
element in WL′ cannot be L-regular. By direct inspections, one can find such β
unless L is the type given in (i), (iii) of the lemma. Assume that L is as in the

then a regular vector v ∈ V ′ can be written explicitly, and one can check the L-
regularity by direct inspections. If WL′ is of type D5 (in the case where W is of type
E7 ), a must be of type (a) (otherwise it is easy to see that a is not L-regular). But
this element is nothing but the regular element in A4 , and the checking is reduced
to the previous case. The details are omitted.                                      

    1.6. In what follows we consider a specific cyclic group Γ ∈ NW (WL ), and
u ∈ L according to the following two cases.
Case (a): WL′ 6= {1}.
    In this case, we assume that L is simple modulo center. We choose an L-regular
element a ∈ WL′ , and put Γ = hai. Let e be the order of Γ . Thus Γ ⊂ WL′ and we
have Γ × WL ⊂ W . We take any unipotent element u ∈ L.
Case (b): WL′ = {1}.
     In this case, we assume that L is of type X0 + e(An1 −1 + · · · + Anr −1 ) with X0
irreducible. We further assume that any β ∈ Φ − ΦL is not orthogonal to the root
system e(An1 −1 + · · · + Anr −1 ). (Note: since WL′ = {1}, any irreducible component
of the Dynkin diagram corresponding to Π − ΠL consists of 1 or 2 nodes. The
latter condition is satisfied for type Bn if all the irreducible components consist of
one node, and for type An , Dn if the number of irreducible components having two
nodes is at most 1.)
     We choose a ∈ W so that a permutes each component Ani −1 in a cyclic way,
and acts trivially on X0 . Thus a ∈ Sen1 × · · · × Senr , and a is a product of disjoint
cycles of length e. In particular, Γ = hai ⊂ NW (WL ), and the subgroup of W
generated by Γ and WL coincides with the semidirect product Γ ⋉ WL . Now L
is isogenic to G0 × G1 × · · · × Gr modulo center, where G0 is of type X0 , and
Gi ≃ GLni × · · · × GLni (e-factors). We choose a unipotent element u ∈ L so that
u corresponds to (u0, u1 , . . . , ur ), where u0 ∈ G0 is arbitrary, and ui is a diagonal
element in Gi , i.e., ui = (vi , . . . , vi ) with vi ∈ GLni for i = 1, . . . , r.
    We can state our main theorem, whose proof will be given in the next section.
Theorem 1.7. Assume that G is defined over C. Let L be a Levi subgroup in G.
Assume that a cyclic subgroup Γ of order e in NW (WL ) and u ∈ L are given as in
1.4. Put WfL = Γ ⋉ WL . Then the followings hold.
     (i) WL -module H ∗ (BuL ) can be extended to a W   fL -module so that Γ × W
                                                                               fL -module
          ∗   L (ζ ′ )                                           ′
         H (Bu )       is defined for any e-th root of unity ζ .
    (ii) There exists a primitive e-th root of unity ζ such that
                                                    

        as Γ × W -modules.

Remarks 1.8.       (i) The extension of WL -module H ∗ (BuL ) to W           fL -module is not
unique. The theorem aaserts that the statement (ii) holds for some choice of exten-
sion.
    (ii) The theorem asserts that (1.7.1) holds for some choice of primitive e-th
root of unity ζ, but then it holds for any choice of primitive root of unity ζ ′ . In
fact, we can write ζ ′ = ζ j for some j prime to e, and we have an automorphism τ
on Γ such that τ (a) = aj . It follows from (1.7.1) that we have an isomorphism of
Γ × W modules, where the action of Γ is twisted          by τ . It is easy to check that the   
twisted Γ × W -module Γ -IndW   WL H   ∗
                                         (Bu
                                            L (ζ)
                                             )      is isomorphic   to Γ -IndW      ∗  L (ζ ′ )
                                                                              WL H (Bu )          ,
                              ∗    (ζ)                          ∗     (ζ ′ )
and similarly the twisted H (Bu ) is isomorphic to H (Bu ) . Thus (1.7.1) holds
also for ζ ′.


                               2. Proof of Theorem 1.7

    2.1. In the case where e = 1, Theorem 1.7 is nothing but the original induction
theorem. So we assume that e ≥ 2 in what follows. Since the structure of the W -
module H n (Bu ) is independent of p provided that p is a good prime, it is enough
to show the corresponding formula for an appropriate p. So, we assume that G is
defined over Fp , of split type, with Frobenius map F . We assume that T ⊂ B are
both F -stable, and that L ⊂ P are F -stable. Thus F acts trivially on W and on
WL . We first note that
Lemma 2.2. Let a ∈ NW (WL ) and choose ȧ ∈ NG (T ) ∩ NG (L). Assume that ȧ ∈
ZG (u). Then ad ȧ stabilizes BuL , and acts on H ∗ (BuL ) in such a way that ad ȧ(w) =
awa−1 for w ∈ WL .
Proof. Since ȧ ∈ NG (L), ȧ acts on BL by the adjoint action ad ȧ, which stabilizes BuL
since ȧ ∈ ZG (u). Hence ȧ acts naturally on H ∗ (BuL ). In order to compare this action
with the action of WL , we shall recall the construction of Springer representations
of WL . Let
                        e = {(x, gB) ∈ L × BL | g −1 xg ∈ B},
                        L
and π : L e → L be the first projection. Let Lr be the set of regular semisimple
elements in L. Then π −1 (Lr ) is isomorphic to

                                        er = Tr × L/T,
                                        L

where Tr = T ∩ Lr . Let π0 : L  er → Lr be the map defined by π0 : (t, gT ) 7→ g −1 tg,
which coincides with the restriction of π on Ler under the identification π −1 (Lr ) ≃ L
                                                                                       er .
Then π0 is an unramified Galois covering with group WL , and for a constant sheaf
       er , L = π∗ Q̄l is a WL -equivariant local system on Lr . Thus K = IC(L, L) is
Q̄l on L
a WL -equivariant complex on L, and it is known by Lusztig that K ≃ π∗ Q̄l . Thus
for each u ∈ L, the stalk Hui (K) at u of the i-th cohomology sheaf of K gives rise
to a WL -module H i (BuL ).
                                SPRINGER REPRESENTATIONS                                        7

     Now ȧ acts on L  er (resp. on Lr ) by ad ȧ : (t, gT ) 7→ (ȧtȧ−1 , ȧg ȧ−1 T ) (resp.
                  −1
ad ȧ : x 7→ ȧxȧ ), and π0 commutes with ad ȧ. Hence L becomes an ȧ-equivariant
local system. Since π0−1 (t) = {(wtw −1, wT ) | w ∈ WL } for t ∈ Tr , the stalk Lt has
a natural structure of the regular WL -module. Then the isomorphism Lȧtȧ−1 → Lt
is given by ad ȧ−1 under the identification Lx ≃ Q̄l [WL ] for x ∈ Lr . It follows that
L is hȧi⋉WL -equivariant, where hȧi is a cyclic group generated by ȧ, and ȧ acts on
WL by ad ȧ(w) = awa−1 . By the functoriality of IC functor, K turns out to be a
ȧ-equivariant complex on L under the adjoint action of ȧ, which is regarded as a
hȧi⋉WL -equivariant complex on L. Hence for u ∈ L such that ȧuȧ−1 = u, Hui (K)
has a structure of hȧi⋉WL -module.
     On the other hand, ȧ acts naturally on Le and on L by the adjoint action, which
commute with π. Thus π∗ Q̄l is ȧ-equivariant, which is isomorphic to K as the
complex with ȧ-action. Hence the action of ȧ on Hui (K) coincides with the action
on H i (BuL ) induced from the adjoint action of ȧ on BuL . The lemma follows from
this.                                                                                       
    Next we show the following lemma.
Lemma 2.3. There exists a representative ȧ ∈ NG (T ) ∩ NG (L) ∩ ZG (u) such that ȧ
acts trivially on H ∗ (Bu ) and that ȧe acts trivially on H ∗(BuL ). In particular, H ∗ (BuL )
has a structure of WfL -module.

Proof. First consider the case (a) in 1.6. Let H be the subgroup of G generated by
Uα with α ∈ ΦL′ , where Uα is the root subgroup corresponding to α. Then H is
a connected reductive subgroup of L′ whose Weyl group coincides with WL′ . Since
H ⊂ ZG (u), we have H ⊂ ZG0 (u). One can choose a representative ȧ ∈ NH (T1 ) of
a ∈ WL′ , where T1 is a maximal torus of H contained in T . Then ȧ ∈ ZG0 (u) ∩NG (L)
and ȧe ∈ T1 . Since T1 ⊂ ZG (u), we see that T1 ⊂ ZL0 (u). Thus, ȧe ∈ ZL0 (u). Hence
ȧ satisfies the condition.
     Next consider the case (b) in 1.6. Let L1 be the Levi subgroup containing L
of type Xn0 + Aen1 −1 + · · · + Aenr −1 . We have a natural projection π : L1 → L̄1 =
L1 /Z 0(L1 ), and an isogeny map θ : L       e1 = G0 × SLen × · · · × SLenr → L̄1 , where
                                                                 1
G0 is the simply connected semisimple group of type X0 . Put ū = π(u) ∈ L̄1 . Now
ZL1 (u) acts on H ∗ (Bu ). Since Z 0 (L1 ) acts trivially on H ∗ (Bu ), we have an action of
ZL1 (u)/Z 0(L1 ) = ZL̄1 (ū) on H ∗ (Bu ). Let u e be an element in L   e1 such that θ(e  u) = ū.
u                                                                                 e
e = (u0 , u1, . . . , ur ) can be chosen as given in 1.4. We choose ä ∈ L1 as follows;
put ä = (a0 , a1 , . . . , ar ) with a0 ∈ G0 , and ai ∈ SLeni for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. We put
                                                   0
a0 = 1 and choose a1 , . . . , ar so that ai ∈ ZSL   eni
                                                         (ui ) and that aei ∈ Z(SLeni ). Such a
choice is always possible for ui of type (ni , . . . , ni ). Thus ä ∈ ZLe0 (eu). It follows that
                                                                            1
θ(ä) is contained in a connected subgroup of ZL̄1 (ū1), and by the previous remark,
θ(ä) acts trivially on H ∗ (Bu ). Now take ȧ ∈ ZL1 (u) such that π(ȧ) = θ(ä). Then
ȧ ∈ NG (T )∩NG (L), and acts trivially on H ∗ (Bu ). On the other hand, similar to π, θ,
we have a map π ′ : L → L̄ = L/Z 0 (L) and θ′ : L     e = G0 ×(SLn1 )e ×· · ·×(SLnr )e → L̄.
Let ū = π ′ (u) ∈ L̄, and u     e∈L e such that ū = θ′ (e
                                                          u). Then we have an isomorphism
   ∗   L       ∗     L̄        ∗  Le
H (Bu ) ≃ H (Bū ) ≃ H (Bue ) compatible with the actions of ZL (u), ZL̄ (ū) and ZLe (e       u)
with respect to π ′ , θ′ . We have äe ∈ Z(SLn1 )e × Z(SLn2 )e × · · · . Since the action of
8                                           SHOJI

Z(SLn1 )e ×Z(SLn2 )e ×· · · can be extended to an action of Z(GLn1 )e ×Z(GLn2 )e ×· · ·
           e                                  e
on H ∗ (BuLe ), äe acts trivially on H ∗ (BuLe ), and so ȧe acts trivially on H ∗ (BuL ). 

   2.4. Let Z = ZL0 be the identity component of the center of L. Put BZ =
{B ∈ B | Z ⊂ B ′ }. Then BZ is decomposed into connected components
    ′

                                              a
                                    BZ =              BZ,d ,
                                            d∈WL \W


where BZ,d = {xd B | x ∈ L}, which is isomorphic to BL under the map B ′ 7→ B ′ ∩ L.
    Put
                            Zreg = {z ∈ Z | ZG0 (z) = L}.
Then for any t ∈ Zreg , we have Bt = BZ by Lemma 2.2 (c) in [L3], and so Btu =
Bu ∩ Bt = Bu ∩ BZ . It follows that
                                      a
                             Btu =        (BZ,d ∩ Bu ),
                                         d∈WL \W


where BZ,d ∩ Bu is isomorphic to BuL under the map B ′ 7→ B ′ ∩ L. This implies that
                                           M
(2.4.1)                  H 2n (Btu ) ≃               H 2n (BZ,d ∩ Bu ).
                                         d−1 ∈W/WL


The right hand side of (2.4.1) has a natural structure of the induced W -module
IndW       2n    L
    WL H (Bu ). It is proved in [L3, Proposition 1.4] that (2.4.1) is actually an
isomorphism of W -modules. Let a ∈ W be as in the theorem. Since ȧ ∈ NG (L),
it stabilizes Z, and so ȧ acts on BZ via ad ȧ. It is easy to see that ȧ induces a
permutation action on the components of BZ ; ȧ : BZ,d 7→ BZ,ad . It follows that
ȧ induces an automorphism on H 2n (Btu ), which maps the factor corresponding to
d−1 ∈ W/WL to d−1 a−1 ∈ W/WL . Under the isomorphism H 2n (BZ,d ∩ Bu ) ≃
H 2n (BuL ), the factor corresponding to d−1 ∈ W/WL is written as d−1 ⊗H 2n (BuL ), and ȧ
maps d−1 ⊗H 2n (BuL ) → d−1 a−1 ⊗H 2n (BuL ). On the other hand, by Lemma 2.3, ȧe acts
                                                   fL on it. Hence ȧ induces an action
trivially on H 2n (BuL ), and induces an action of W
                             W
of Γ0 on H (Btu ) ≃ IndWL H (Bu ), which is given by ȧ : d−1 ⊗ x 7→ d−1 a−1 ⊗ ȧx
              2n                  2n  L

for each factor d−1 ⊗ H 2n (BuL ).
     Now we define an action of Γ on H ∗ (Btu ) by a : x 7→ ζ n ȧx for x ∈ H 2n (Btu ),
where ȧx is the action of Γ0 on H 2n (Btu ) given as above. Since the action of ȧ ∈ G
commutes with that of W , H ∗ (Btu ) turns out to be a Γ × W -module, which we
denote by H ∗ (Btu )[ζ] . The following lemma is immediate from the above discussion.
Lemma 2.5. There exists an isomorphism of Γ × W -modules

                            H ∗ (Btu )[ζ] ≃ Γ -IndW   ∗  L (ζ)
                                                  WL H (Bu ) .

     In view of Lemma 2.5, in order to prove the theorem it is enough to show the
following proposition.
                              SPRINGER REPRESENTATIONS                                     9

Proposition 2.6. Under an appropriate choice of (a good prime) p, there exists an
isomorphism of Γ × W -modules for any t ∈ Zr ,

                                 H ∗ (Bu )(ζ) ≃ H ∗ (Btu )[ζ] .


     2.7. The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of the proposition.
We shall prove it by modifying the arguments in [L3]. By [Sh1], [Sh2], [BS], the
following fact is known; assume that G is simple modulo center. Then for each
unipotent class C of G, there exists u1 ∈ C F , called a split unipotent element,
such that F acts on H 2n (Bu1 ) as a scalar multiplication by pn . (In the case where
G is of type E8 , we assume that p ≡ 1 (mod 4)). Since the component group
AG (u1 ) = ZG (u1 )/ZG0 (u1) is isomorphic to S3 , S4 , S5 or (Z/2Z)k for some k, there
exists a positive integer s0 (independent of p) such that F s0 acts on H 2n (Bu ) by a
scalar multiplication by ps0 n for any unipotent element u of GF (e.g., one can take
s0 = |S5 |.) Similarly, F s0 acts on H 2n (BuL ) by a scalar multiplication by ps0 n for any
unipotent element u ∈ LF . Note that the isomorphism in (2.4.1) is F -equivariant.
Hence F s0 acts also as a scalar multiplication by ps0 n for H 2n (Btu ).
     Note that ȧ acts trivially on H 2n (Bu ) by Lemma 2.3. It follows that one can
write
                                                      X
(2.7.1)                  Tr ((F s ȧ)i w, H ∗(Bu )) =    an (w)pisn ,
                                                         n≥0
                                                         X
(2.7.2)                 Tr ((w, ai ), H ∗ (Bu )(ζ) ) =         an (w)ζ in,
                                                         n≥0


for any w ∈ W, 0 ≤ i ≤ e − 1 and for any positive integer s divisible by s0 , where
an (w) = Tr (w, H n (Bu )) are integers for each n ≥ 0.
    On the other hand, by the description of the action of F and of ȧ on H n (Btu )
in 2.4, together with Lemma 2.5, one can write
                                                      X
(2.7.3)                 Tr ((F s ȧ)i w, H ∗(Btu )) =   bn,i (w)pisn ,
                                                         n≥0
                                                         X
                                 i     ∗       [ζ]
(2.7.4)                 Tr ((w, a ), H (Btu ) ) =              bn,i (w)ζ in,
                                                         n≥0


for w, i, s as above, where bn,i (w) are certain integers.
    For an integer x and a prime number l, we denote by ml (x) the multiplicative
order of x in Z/lZ, i.e., the smallest positive integer m such that xm ≡ 1 (mod l).
The following is a key for the proof of Proposition 2.6.
Lemma 2.8. Assume that p ≡ 1 (mod 4). Let s0 , e be fixed positive integers coprime
to p. Then there exist infinitely many prime numbers l satisfying the following
properties.
    (i) ml (ps ) = e for a certain integer s divisible by s0 .
   (ii) l − 1 is divisible by e.
10                                             SHOJI

Proof. By our assumption, the image of s0 e on Fp = Z/pZ is non-zero. Hence the
map x 7→ s0 ex + 1 induces a bijective map on Fp . Thus there exists c ∈ Z such that
the image of s0 ec + 1 in Fp is contained in F∗p − (F∗p )2 . Put α = s0 ec + 1. Then α
is prime to p, and so (α − 1)p and α are coprime each other. Then by Dirichlet’s
theorem on arithmetic progression, there exist infinitely many prime numbers l of
the form l = n(α − 1)p + α for some positive integer n. It is enough to show that
these l ≥ 3 satisfy the assertion of the lemma. For an integer a and a prime number
        a

        p

                  a      1       if x2 ≡ a (mod p) for some x ∈ Z,
                     =
                  p       −1      otherwise.

We show that

(2.8.1)                                       = −1.
                                           l
In fact, by the quadratic reciprocity law (e.g., [Se]), we have

                                p l        p−1 l−1
                                       = (−1) 2 · 2 = 1.
                                l p

The second equality follows from the assumption that p ≡ 1 (mod 4). Hence we
       p      l                                 l      α
have       =      . But l ≡ α (mod p), and so        =       = −1 since the image of α
        l      p                                  p       p
is not contained in F2p by our choice of α. Hence (2.8.1) holds.
    Now (2.8.1) is equivalent to p(l−1)/2 ≡ −1 (mod l). It follows that ml (p) = l − 1.
Since l − 1 = s0 ec(np + 1), we see that ml (ps ) = e for s = s0 c(np + 1) and that
l − 1 is divisible by e. Thus this l satisfies the assertion of the lemma. The lemma
is proved.                                                                           

     2.9 For given integers s0 ≥ 1, e ≥ 2, we choose a prime number p such that
p is not a factor of e, s0 and that p ≡ 1 (mod 4), and fix it once and for all. For
a multiple s of s0 , put F ′ = F s ȧ and q = ps . Under the setting in 1.6, we shall
describe the Sset Zreg more precisely. As in [L3, Lemma 2.2], Zreg can be written as
Zreg = Z − β ker(β|Z ), where β runs over all the roots in Φ − ΦL . (β|Z gives a
non-trivial character of Z for β ∈ Φ − ΦL ).
     First consider the case (a). Let L′ der be the derived subgroup of L′ , and S ′ be the
split maximal torus of L′ der contained in T . Then S ′ ⊂ Z. Put Sreg
                                                                    ′        ′
                                                                      T= S ∩Zreg . Now
WL′ leaves the set Φ−ΦL invariant. For each β ∈ Φ−ΦL , put Hβ = x∈Γ ker(x(β)|S ′ ).
Then Hβ is an F ′ -stable subgroup of S ′ , and we see that
                                 F′            F′
                                                         [          ′
(2.9.1)                        S ′ reg = S ′        −            HβF .
                                                        β∈Φ−ΦL


Hβ is a closed subgroup of S ′ , and we put eβ = |Hβ /Hβ0 | for each β ∈ Φ − ΦL .

    Let P ′ be the set of all prime numbers l satisfying the condition in Lemma 2.8.
Thus P ′ is an infinite set. We denote by P the subset of P ′ consisting of l such that
l > |Φ − ΦL | and that l does not divide eβ (β ∈ Φ − ΦL ). Thus P is an infinite set
also.
    Next we consider the case (b). We may assume that G has a connected center of
dimension 1, and that the derived subgroup of G is simply connected, almost simple.
Let k be an algebraic closure of Fq . We see that there exists a subtorus S of Z such
that S ≃ (k ∗ )c , where c is the number of irreducible components of ΦL . Since a
                                              ′                    ′
permutes the factors k ∗ in S, we see that S F ≃ (F∗qe )r × (F∗q )r , where r ′ is equal to
1 or 0 according to the cases where X0 is non-empty or empty.  T Since Γ ⊂ NW (WL ),
Γ preserves the set Φ − ΦL . For each β ∈ Φ − ΦL , put Kβ = x∈Γ ker(x(β)|S ). Then
Kβ is an F ′ -stable subgroup of S, and we have
                                   ′            ′
                                                         [          ′

where Sreg = S ∩ Zreg . Kβ is a closed subgroup of S, and put eβ = |Kβ /Kβ0 | for
                                                         ′                    ′
each β ∈ Φ − ΦL . Under the identification S F ≃ (F∗qe )r × (F∗q )r , we see that

Kβ0F ≃ (F∗qe )r−1 × (F∗q )r or Kβ0F ≃ F∗qe′ × (F∗qe )r−1 × (F∗q )r , where e′ is a proper
divisor of e. (Let Si be the subtorus of S corresponding to the factor eAni −1 for
i = 1, . . . , r. Then the former case occurs if β|Si , β|Sj are non-trivial for some i 6= j,
and the latter case occurs if β|Si is non-trivial for only one i. Note that by our
assumption in 1.4, β is non-trivial on S1 × · · · × Sr .)
    Let P ′ be as in the case (a). We define a subset P of P ′ as the set of prime
numbers l ∈ P ′ such that l > |Φ − ΦL | and that l does not divide eβ .
    The next lemma is a variant of Lemma 3.4 in [L3].
Lemma 2.10. Assume that l ∈ P, and let s be a multiple of s0 such that ml (ps ) = e
(see Lemma 2.8). Put F ′ = F s ȧ. Then there exists t ∈ Zreg such that F ′ (t) = t and
that tl = 1.
Proof. First consider the case (a) in 1.6. It is enough to show, for each l ∈ P, that
                        ′
there exists t ∈ S ′ Freg such that tl = 1. Note that a is a regular element of order e
in WL′ . Put V = R ⊗Z X(S ′ ). Thus WL′ acts on V as a reflection group. Let ζ
be a primitive e-th root of unity, and let a(e) be the dimension of the eigenspace
V (a, ζ) ⊂ V of a with eigenvalue ζ. We show that
                                           F′
(2.10.1)                       ♯{t ∈ S ′        | tl = 1} = la(e) .
                                                    ′
    By a general formula, we have |S ′F | = | detV (qI − a)| = Pa (q), where Pa (x) is
the characteristic polynomial of a ∈ WL′ . Since a is regular Pa (x) can be written,
by [Sp1, 4.2], as
                                  Pa (x) = Φe (x)a(e) Φ′ (x),
where Φe (x) is the cyclotomic polynomial of degree e, and Φ′ (x) is a product of
cyclotomic polynomials Φe′ (x) with e′ < e. By our assumption ml (q) = e, Φe (q) is
divisible by l, and Φ′ (q) is not divisible by l. This means that each minimal F ′ -stable
12                                             SHOJI

torus M of S ′ corresponding to the factor Φe (x) contains an element of order l. Since
          ′                    ′
{t ∈ M F | tl = 1} ⊂ F∗qe , M F contains exactly l elements t such that tl = 1. Thus
(2.10.1) is proved.
     For β ∈ Φ − ΦL , let Vβ be the subspace of V which is orthogonal to x(β) for
all x ∈ Γ . Then Vβ can be identified with R ⊗Z X(Hβ0). Γ stabilizes Vβ , and let
Vβ (a, ζ) be the eigenspace of a on Vβ with eigenvalue ζ. Since a is L-regular, we
have dim Vβ (a, ζ) < dim V (a, ζ) = a(e). It follows that the characteristic polynomial
Pa′ (x) of a on Vβ contains the factor Φe (x) with multiplicity less than a(e). By a
similar argument as above, minimal F ′ -stable subtori of Hβ0 corresponding to Φe (x)
only contain elements of order l. This implies that
                            ′                                ′
                 ♯{t ∈ HαF | tl = 1} = ♯{t ∈ Hα0F | tl = 1} ≤ la(e)−1 .

It follows, by (2.9.1), that
                       F′                            F′

where N = |Φ − ΦL |. Since l > N by our assumption, there exists t ∈ S ′ Freg such
that tl = 1. This proves the lemma in the case (a).
     Next consider the case (b) in 1.6. It is enough to show, for each l ∈ P, that
                   F′                                   ′
there exists t ∈ Sreg such that tl = 1. We note that q e − 1 is not divisible by l for
                                                                 ′                   ′
any divisor e′ < e of e by the assumption ml (q) = e. Since S F ≃ (F∗qe )r × (F∗q )r
(cf. 2.9), we have
                                               ′
                                    ♯{t ∈ S F | tl = 1} = lr .
We consider Kβ given in 2.9. By the discussion in 2.9, we have
                                ′                                ′
                  ♯{t ∈ KβF | tl = 1} = ♯{t ∈ Kβ0F | tl = 1} = lr−1 .

It follows, by (2.9.2), that
                        ′                             ′
                                                                                 [              ′

                                                                               β∈Φ−ΦL

where N is as before. Since l > N by our assumption, the lemma holds also for the
case (b).                                                                      

     We need the following lemma due to Lusztig.

Lemma 2.11 ([L3, Lemma 3.2]). Let H be a finite group, and φ a virtual character
of H (over a field of characteristic 0). Assume that φ is integral valued. Let x, y ∈ H
be such that xy = yx and y l = 1 for a prime number l. Then φ(xy) − φ(x) ∈ lZ.

    2.12. Let s0 be as in 2.7, and P be as in 2.9. Let F ′ = F s ȧ be as in Lemma
2.10 for a fixed l ∈ P. Let Rw,i = RTw (1) be the Deligne-Lusztig’s virtual character
      ′i
of GF for i = 1, . . . , e, where Tw is an F ′i -stable maximal torus of G corresponding
to w ∈ W ≃ W (T1 ) (here W (T1 ) = NG (T1 )/T1 for an F ′ -stable pair T1 ⊂ B1 ). Let
us choose t ∈ Zreg as in Lemma 2.10. Then we have

(2.12.1)                      Tr (F ′i w, H ∗(Bu )) = Tr (u, Rw,i ),
                             Tr (F ′i w, H ∗(Btu )) = Tr (tu, Rw,i ).

We remark that (2.12.1) was proved in [L2] under the assumption that ps is large
enough (which is determined only by the data of the Dynkin diagram of G). Thus
if we replace s0 in 2.7 by a suitable large number, the result in [L2] is applicable.
One can also apply [Sh3, Theorem 2.2] instead of [L2], where the restriction on ps
is removed.
                                                                               ′i
     Since Rw,i are integral valued, one can apply Lemma 2.11 for H = GF and
x = u, y = t. Hence we have

                            Tr (u, Rw,i ) = Tr (tu, Rw,i ) mod lZ.

It follows from (2.12.1) that

(2.12.2)            Tr (F ′i w, H ∗(Bu )) = Tr (F ′i w, H ∗(Btu )) mod lZ.

    Let ζ0 be a fixed primitive e-th root of unity in C, and R the ring of integers
of the cyclotomic field Q(ζ0 ). Let I be the set of non-zero prime ideals p in R such
that p contains one of the numbers 1 − ζ0i for i = 1, . . . , e − 1 and ζ0 . Let Ī be the
set of prime numbers l such that p ∩ Z = lZ for p ∈ I. Since I is a finite set, Ī is
a finite set. So, P − Ī is an infinite set. Let J be the set of prime ideals p of R
such that p ∩ Z = lZ with l ∈ P − Ī. Then J is an infinite set. Now R/p is a finite
extension of Fl . Let ζ̄0 be the image of ζ0 in R/p. Since l ∈ P, l − 1 is divisible by
e. Hence ζ̄0 ∈ F∗l , which has order e by our choice of p. Since ml (ps ) = e, the image
of ps in Z/lZ has order e. Hence there exists j such that

(2.12.3)                                   ps − ζ0j ∈ p.

Note that the number j is determined by the choice of p, which we denote by j(p).
For j = 1, .S . . , e − 1, let Jj be the set of prime ideals p in J such that j(p) = j.
Thus J = j Jj , and so there exists j0 such that J0 = Jj0 is an infinite set. We
put ζ = ζ0j0 . By (2.12.3), ζ is a primitive e-th root of unity.
    We remark that H ∗ (Btu ) = H ∗ (Bu ∩ BZ ) is independent of the choice of t ∈ Zreg .
Then in view of (2.7.1) ∼ (2.7.4), together with (2.12.3), we see that

                 Tr ((F s ȧ)i w, H ∗(Bu )) = Tr ((w, ai ), H ∗ (Bu )(ζ) )   mod p,
           Tr ((F s ȧ)i w, H ∗(Bu ∩ BZ )) = Tr ((w, ai ), H ∗ (Bu ∩ BZ )[ζ] )   mod p
14                                              SHOJI

for any p ∈ J0 . Combined with (2.12.2), we have

              Tr ((w, ai ), H ∗ (Bu )(ζ) ) = Tr ((w, ai ), H ∗ (Bu ∩ BZ )[ζ])   mod p

for p ∈ J0. Since J0 is an infinite set, we conclude that

                  Tr ((w, ai ), H ∗(Bu )(ζ) ) = Tr ((w, ai ), H ∗ (Bu ∩ BZ )[ζ] ).

Hence Proposition 2.6 is proved, and the theorem follows.


                                       3. Applications

    3.1. Let WL be the subgroup of W , and Γ the subgroup of W generated by a ∈

Let V = V    (ζ)

as a subgroup of W   fL , cf. 1.3.) Then V can be decomposed as V = L                 (i)

                                                         (i)
Proof. Under the action of Γ on Γ -IndW   WL V , wbk ⊗Vn is contained in an eigenspace
                       k+n+j
of a with eigenvalue ζ       . Then (i) follows easily from the discussion in 3.1. Now
assume that Γ commutes with WL . Then bk ⊗ V (i) has a structure of Γ × WL -
module given by ψ (−k) ⊗ V (i) . (ii) follows from the formula (3.2.1) by noticing that
          (i)
V (i) = V0 . The lemma is proved.                                                    
    We consider a Levi subgroup L ⊂ G and a unipotent element u ∈ L, and take
Γ = hai ⊂ NW (WL ) satisfying the condition in 1.6. We apply the preceding argument
to the situation V (ζ) = H ∗ (BuL )(ζ) . Then as a corollary to Theorem 1.7, we have
Proposition 3.3. Under the setting in Theorem 1.7, we have, for 0 ≤ k ≤ e − 1,

as vector spaces, where bi ∈ C[Γ ]Land H 2n (BuL )n is the   eigenspace of a ∈ Γ0 with

                                                      (Bu )   is independent of the choice
of k. In the case (a) in 1.6, (3.3.1) can be made more precise as follows;
                     M                            M                          

                 n≡k    mod e                      j∈Z/eZ


as W -modules.
Proof. By Theorem 1.7 Γ -IndW        ∗
                                 WL HL (BuL )(ζ) is isomorphic to H ∗ (Bu )(ζ) as Γ × W -
modules. Since (H ∗ (Bu )(ζ) )(k) =                   2n
                                        n≡k mod e H (Bu ), the corollary follows from
Lemma 3.2.                                                                             

Remarks 3.4. (i) In the case where u = 1, the cohomology ring H ∗ (Bu ) = H ∗ (B)
coincides with the coinvariant algebra R of W . In the special case where G is of
type An−1 , i.e., W ≃ Sn , we consider WL ≃ Sn−re for 1 ≤ e ≤ n. Then WL′ ≃ Sre ,
and if we choose a regular element a ∈ WL′ as a product of disjoint cycles of length
e, Proposition 3.3 can be applied. This recovers the formula obtained by Morita
and Nakajima [MN1].
    More generally, consider the Weyl group W acting on the real vector space V
as the reflection module. For v ∈ V , let Wv be the stabilizer of v in W , and Nv
the stabilizer of the line Rv in W . Note that Wv is normal in Nv , and Wv coincides
with WL for a certain Levi subgroup in G. Then for any Γ = hai such that Γ ⊂ Nv ,
Bonnafé, Lehrer and Michel [BLM] have proved a similar formula as in Proposition
3.3. So our formula (3.3.2) can be regarded as a special case of theirs. (Note that
they treat a more general case, where W is a complex reflection group and Γ is not
necessarily cyclic, in a framework of coinvariant algebras.)
    (ii) We consider a unipotent element u ∈ L in the case where G = GLn . u ∈ G
can be written as u = uµ by a partition µ = (1m1 , 2m2 , . . . , nmn ) of n. Take a
positive integer e ≥ 2, and let I be a subset of {1, . . . , n} such that e ≤ mi for i ∈ I.

                                                   P
We consider
     P        a Levi
                 P    subgroup  L  of type X 0 + e  i∈I Ai−1 , where X0 = Ak with
k = i∈I  / imi +   i∈I i(mi − e) − 1. Then we have WL′ = {1}, and one can choose
u ∈ L so that it satisfies the assumption of the case (b) in 1.6. Thus Proposition
3.3 can be applied. This covers the results on the stability of dimensions obtained
in [MN2], [MN3], where they considered the case |I| = 1 or the case all the mi are
divisible by e.

    Returning to the general setup, we consider the case where u is a regular unipo-
tent element in L. Then H ∗ (BuL ) = H 0 (BuL ) ≃ C is a trivial WL -module. Thus
Proposition 3.3 implies the following.

Corollary 3.5. Let G be a simple algebraic group modulo center, and L a Levi
subgroup in G. Let u be a regular unipotent element in L. Let Γ = hai be a subgroup
of NW (WL ) of order e satisfying the conditions in 1.6. Then for k = 0, . . . , e − 1,
we have
                           M
                                  H 2n (Bu ) ≃ IndW     e(−k)
                                                  Γ ⋉WL ψ
                          n≡k   mod e

as W -modules, where ψe(−k) is the character of Γ ⋉ WL obtained as the pull back of
ψ (−k) under the projection Γ ⋉ WL → Γ .

Proof. In the case (a), the assertion follows from (3.3.2). So we consider the case
(b). In the setup of 3.1, V (i) is a trivial WL -module C for i = 0 and zero otherwise.
                               (0)                                   fL -module ψe(−k) .
Then we see that V (0) = V0 , and bk ⊗ V (0) has a structure of W
The assertion follows from the formula in 3.1.                                       


    3.6. Let G be a simple algebraic group defined over Fq with Frobenius map
F . We assume that GF is of split type. The Green function QTw is defined as the
restriction of the Deligne-Lusztig’s virtual character RTw (1) to the set of unipotent
elements in GF . We assume that p = ch Fq is good, and in the case where G is of
type E8 , we further assume that q ≡ 1 (mod 4). Then as explained in 2.7, for each
unipotent class C of G, there exists a split element u ∈ C F . As in 2.12, we have
                                     X
(3.6.1)                   QTw (u) =      Tr (w, H 2n (Bu ))q n .
                                        n≥0


Hence there exists a polynomial Qw,C (x) ∈ Z[x] such that QTw (u) = Qw,C (q).
Concerning the values of Green functions at root of unity, we have the following.

Proposition 3.7. Suppose that G, L and u ∈ L are as in Corollary 3.5. Then we
have

(3.7.1)             Qw,C (ζ j ) = |WL |−1 ♯{x ∈ W | x−1 wx ∈ aj WL }

for j = 0, . . . , e − 1. In particular, the value Qw,C (ζ ′ ) is independent of the choice
of a primitive e-th root of unity ζ ′.

It follows, by (3.6.1) together with Corollary 3.5, that
                                    e−1
                                    X              X

                                                        X              e−1
                                                                       X
                                                   −1
                                  = |Γ ⋉ WL |                 ci (w)         ζ (j−i)k
                                                        i=0            k=0

                                  = |WL | cj (w).

Hence we obtain the formula (3.7.1). Let ζ j be a primitive e-th root of unity. There
exists an element τ ∈ Gal(Q(ζ)/Q) such that τ (ζ) = ζ j . By (3.6.1), we see that
Qw,C (ζ) ∈ Q(ζ) and that τ (Qw,C (ζ)) = Qw,C (ζ j ). But since Qw,C (ζ) ∈ Z by (3.7.1),
we conclude that Qw,C (ζ) = Qw,C (ζ j ). This proves the proposition.                

Remark 3.8. In the case where G = GLn and L is of type Am−1 + · · · + Am−1
(e-times) with n = em, take a regular unipotent element u in L. Then u = uµ ∈ G
with µ = (me ). For w ∈ W = Sn , let λ(w) = (1l1 , 2l2 , . . . ) be the partition of
n corresponding to the cycle decomposition of w. Then one can show by a direct
computation (cf. [M, (6.2)]) that
                                            (
                                             el(λ(w))    if e | li for all i,
         |WL |−1 ♯{x ∈ W | x−1 wx ∈ aWL } =
                                             0           otherwise,

where l(λ) is the number of parts for a partition λ. Thus we recover the formula
in [LLT, Theorem 3.2, Theorem 3.4] concerning the values of Green polynomials of
GLn at roots of unity.
     3.9. We give some more examples where Proposition 3.3 can be applied.
     (i) Assume that G is of type Bn and L is a Levi subgroup of type Bm with
m < n. Then L′ is of type An−m−1 . For any u ∈ L and a divisor e of n − m, the
proposition can be applied. Similar results hold also for Cn or Dn .
     (ii) Assume that G = Sp2n . Then a unipotent element u ∈ G can be written
as u = uµ as an element of GL2n , where µ = (1m1 , 2m2 , . . . ) is a partition of 2n such
that mi is even for odd i. Take an even integer e ≥ 2, and let I be a subset of odd
integers {1, 3, P
                . . . , 2n−1} such that e ≤ mi for i ∈ I. We consider
                                                               P        a Levi

of type X0 +e i∈I Ai−1 , where X0 is of type Ck with 2k = i∈I      /  im i +   i∈I i(mi −e).

Then WL′ = {1}, and as in Remarks 3.4 (ii), one can find u ∈ L so that the case
(b) in 1.6 can be applied. Similar results hold also for type Bn and Dn .
     (iii) Assume that G is of type E7 , and choose L of type A2 so that L′ is of type
A4 . Take any unipotent element u ∈ L. Then the proposition can be applied with
e = 5.
