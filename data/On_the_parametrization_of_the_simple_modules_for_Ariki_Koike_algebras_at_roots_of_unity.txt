                                                         Following the ideas of M.Geck and R.Rouquier in [19], we show that
                                                     there exists a “canonical basic set” of Specht modules in bijection with the
                                                     set of simple modules of Ariki-Koike algebras at roots of unity. Moreover,
                                                     we determine the parametrization of this set and we give the consequences
                                                     of these results on the representation theory of Ariki-Koike algebras.


                                             1       Introduction
                                             Let H be an Iwahori-Hecke algebra of a finite Weyl group W (or of an extended
                                             Weyl group) defined over A := Z[v, v −1 ] where v is an indeterminate. For
                                             any ring homomorphism θ : A → k into a field k, we have the corresponding
                                             specialized algebra Hk := k ⊗A H. Assume that K is the field of fractions of A.
                                             Then, the algebra HK is split semi-simple and isomorphic to the group algebra
                                             K[W ].
                                                  One of the major problems is the determination of the simple Hk -modules
                                             when Hk is not semi-simple. This problem may be attacked by using the cor-
                                             responding decomposition matrix, which relates the simple Hk -modules to the
                                             simple HK -modules, by a process of modular reduction.
                                                  In [19], using an ordering of simple HK -modules by Lusztig a-function, Geck
                                             and Rouquier showed that there exists a canonical set B ⊂ Irr(HK ) in bijection
                                             with Irr(Hk ) (see also [15] and [16]). As a consequence, this set gives a natural
                                             way for labeling the simple Hk -modules. The Lusztig a-function has several
                                             interpretations: one in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of H and one in terms
                                             of Schur elements (the coincidence is shown in [25]).
                                                  In this paper, we consider the case of Ariki-Koike algebras. Let d ∈ N>0 and
                                             Hn := Hn (v; u0 , ..., ud−1 ) be the Ariki-Koike algebra of type G(d, 1, n) where v,
                                             u0 , u1 ,..., ud−1 are d + 1 parameters. This algebra appeared independently in
                                             [5] and in [8] and can be seen as an analogue of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra for
                                             the complex reflection group (Z/dZ) ≀ Sn .
                                                  As the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type An−1 and Bn are special cases of Ariki-
                                             Koike algebras, it is a natural question to ask whether the set B is well-defined
                                             for the Ariki-Koike algebras. We don’t have Kazhdan-Lusztig type basis for
                                             Ariki-Koike algebras but we do have Schur elements. Hence, we can also define
                                             an a-function for this type of algebras.

                                                                                            1
    When the parameters are generic, the representation theory of Hn over a
field has been studied in [5]. It was shown that this algebra is semi-simple
and that the simple modules S λ are parametrized by the d-tuples of partitions
λ = (λ(0) , ..., λ(d−1) ) of rank n.
    Now, we consider the following choice of parameters:

                     v = ηe ,    ui = ηevj , j = 0, ..., d − 1,

where ηe := exp( 2iπ
                   e ) ∈ C and where 0 ≤ v0 ≤ ... ≤ vd−1 < e.
    In this case, Hn is not semi-simple in general (it may be semi-simple if n
is small). We can also attach to each d-partition λ an Hn -module S λ but it is
reducible in general. In [20], Graham and Lehrer constructed a bilinear form
on each S λ and proved that the simple modules of Hn are given by the non
zero Dλ := S λ /rad(S λ ). Then, Ariki and Mathas (see [2] and [6]) described
the non zero Dλ and showed that they are indexed by some “Kleshchev” multi-
partitions. Unfortunately, we only know a recursive description of this kind of
multipartitions.
    The aim of this paper is to prove that there exists a set B labeled by simple
modules of a semi-simple Ariki-Koike algebra which satisfy the same property
as the canonical set of [19] for Iwahori-Hecke algebras. Moreover, we prove that
the parametrization of this set coincides with the parameterization of the set
of simple Hn -modules found by Foda, Leclerc, Okado, Thibon and Welsh (see
[14]). The proof requires results of Ariki and Foda et al. about Ariki-Koike
algebras, some properties of a-function and some combinatorial objects such as
symbols.
    These results have several consequences. First, it extends some results
proved in [15] where the set B was determined for Hecke algebras of type An−1
and in [22] where B was determined for Hecke algebras of type Dn and Bn with
the following diagram:

                       1         u          u                     u
                        t         t          t     ❵ ❵ ❵           t

    In particular, it yields the determination of the set B for Hecke algebras of
type Bn and, hence, completes the classification of the canonical basic set for
Hecke algebras of finite Weyl groups with one parameter.
    Moreover, using the results of Ariki and the ideas developed by Lascoux,
Leclerc and Thibon in [24] for Hecke algebras of type An−1 , we obtain a “tri-
angular” algorithm for computing the decomposition matrix for Ariki-Koike
algebras when the parameters are roots of unity.
    The paper is divided in six parts. First, we briefly summarize the results
of Ariki and Foda et al. about simple modules for Ariki-Koike algebras and
links with quantum groups. Then, in the second part, following [7], we in-
troduce Schur elements and a-function associated to the simple modules of a
semi-simple Ariki-Koike algebra. In the third part, we prove some combinato-
rial properties about the multipartitions of Foda et al. and the a-function. The
fourth part contains the main theorem of the paper: we give an interpretation
of the multipartitions of Foda et al. in terms of the a-function. Finally, in the
fifth part, we study a particular case of Ariki-Koike algebras : the case of Hecke
algebras of type Bn with equal parameters.

2       Preliminaries
Let R be a commutative associative ring with unit and let v, u0 , ..., ud−1 be
d + 1 invertible elements in R. Let n ∈ N. We define the Ariki-Koike algebra
HR,n := HR,n (v; u0 , ..., ud−1 ) over R to be the unital associative R-algebra
generated by T0 , T1 ,..., Tn−1 subject to the relations:

        (Ti − v)(Ti + 1) = 0                                   for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
        (T0 − u0 )(T0 − u1 )...(T0 − ud−1 ) = 0,
        Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1                              for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2,
        Ti Tj = Tj Ti                                          for |i − j| > 1,
        T0 T1 T0 T1 = T1 T0 T1 T0 .

These relations are obtained by deforming the relations of the wreath product
(Z/dZ) ≀ Sn . The last three ones are known as type B braid relations.
    It is known that the simple modules of (Z/dZ)≀Sn are indexed by the d-tuples
of partitions. We will see that the same is true for the semi-simple Ariki-Koike
algebras defined over a field. In this paper, we say that λ is a d-partition of
rank n if:
                                                                                  (i)       (i)
    • λ = (λ(0) , .., λ(d−1) ) where, for i = 0, ..., d − 1, λ(i) = (λ1 , ..., λri ) is a
                                            (i)           (i)
      partition of rank |λ(i) | such that λ1 ≥ ... ≥ λri > 0,
        d−1
        X
    •         |λ(k) | = n.
        k=0

We denote by Πdn the set of d-partitions of rank n.
     For each d-partition λ of rank n, we can associate a HR,n -module S λ which
is free over R. This is called a Specht module1 .
     Assume that R is a field. Then, for each d-partition of rank n, there is
a natural bilinear form which is defined over each S λ . We denote by rad the
radical associated to this bilinear form. The non zero Dλ := S λ /rad(S λ ) form
a complete set of non-isomorphic simple HR,n -modules (see for example [4,
chapter 13]). In particular, if HR,n is semi-simple, we have rad(S λ ) = 0 for all
λ ∈ Πdn and the set of simple modules are given by the S λ .
     Now, we explain in more details the representation theory of Ariki-Koike
algebras. We summarize the results of Ariki and Foda et al. following [6] and
[14].

2.1      Simple modules of Ariki-Koike algebras and decom-
         position numbers
Here, we assume that R is a field and we consider the Ariki-Koike algebra HR,n
defined over R with parameters v, u0 ,..., ud−1 . First, we have a criterion of
semi-simplicity:
   1 Here, we use the definition of the classical Specht modules. Note that the results in [11]

are given in terms of dual Specht modules. The passage from classical Specht modules to their
                                                                    ′        ′           ′
duals is provided by the map (λ(0) , λ(1) , ..., λ(d−1) ) 7→ (λ(d−1) , λ(d−2) , ..., λ(0) ) where, for
                       ′
i = 0, ..., d − 1, λ(i) denotes the conjugate partition.



                                                  3
Theorem 2.1 (Ariki [1]). HR,n is split semi-simple if and only if we have:
   • for all i 6= j and for all d ∈ Z such that |d| < n, we have:

                                                v d ui 6= uj ,

       n
       Y
   •         (1 + v + ... + v i−1 ) 6= 0.
       i=1

     In this case, as noted at the beginning of this section, Ariki proved that the
simple modules are labeled by the d-partitions λ of rank n.
     Using the results of Dipper and Mathas ([13]), the case where HR,n is not
semi-simple can be reduced to the case where all the ui are powers of v.
     Here, we assume that R is a field of characteristic 0 and that v is a primitive
eth -root of unity with e ≥ 2:

                                   uj = ηevj for j = 0, ..., d − 1,
                                   v = ηe ,

where ηe := exp( 2iπ e ) and where 0 ≤ v0 ≤ ... ≤ vd−1 < e. The problem is
to find the non zero Dλ . To solve it, it is convenient to use the language of
decomposition matrices.
    We define R0 (HR,n ) to be the Grothendieck group of finitely generated HR,n -
modules, which is generated by the simple modules of HR,n . For a finitely
generated HR,n -module M , we denote by [M ] its equivalence class in R0 (HR,n ).
    Now, let R1 (HR,n ) be the Grothendieck group of finitely generated projec-
tive HR,n -modules. This is generated by the indecomposable projective HR,n -
modules. For a finitely generated projective HR,n -module P , we denote by [P ]p
its equivalent class in R1 (HR,n ). We have an injective homomorphism

                                 c : R1 (HR,n ) → R0 (HR,n )

given by c([P ]p ) = [P ] where P is a finitely generated projective HR,n -module.
    Following [6], we denote by Fn the free abelian group with C-basis the set
{[[S λ ]] | λ ∈ Πdn }. Fn can be seen as the Grothendieck group of a semi-simple
Ariki-Koike algebra.
    Let Φdn = {µ ∈ Πdn | Dµ 6= 0}. R0 (HR,n ) is generated by the set {[Dµ ]| µ ∈
Φn }. Hence, for all λ ∈ Πdn , there exist numbers dλ,µ with µ ∈ Φdn such that :
  d

                                               X
                                    [S λ ] =          dλ,µ [Dµ ].
                                               µ∈Φd
                                                  n



The matrix (dλ,µ )λ∈Πdn ,µ∈Φdn is called the decomposition matrix of HR,n .
   Hence, we have a homomorphism:

                                  d : Fn → R0 (HR,n ),
                                  X
defined by d([[S λ ]]) = [S λ ] =      dλ,µ [Dµ ]. d is called the decomposition map.
                                    µ∈Φd
                                       n
Note that if HR,n is semi-simple, the decomposition matrix is just the identity.


                                                  4
   Now, by Brauer reciprocity, we can see that the indecomposable projective
HR,n -modules are labeled by Φdn and that there exists an injective homomor-
phism:
                            e : R1 (HR,n ) → Fn ,
such that for µ ∈ Φdn , if P µ is the indecomposable projective HR,n -module which
is the projective cover of Dµ , we have:
                                             X
                               e([P µ ]p ) =   dλ,µ [[S λ ]].
                                            λ∈Πd
                                               n


By [20, Theorem 3.7], we obtain the following commutative diagram:


                                   R1 (HR,n )
                           ✟e✟                   c

                          ✙

                        Fn                         ✲ R0 (HR,n )


   Now, we turn to the problem of determining which Dλ are non zero. Ariki
and Mathas solve it by using deep results about quantum groups:

2.2     Links with quantum groups and Kleshchev d-partitions
We keep the notations of the first paragraph of this section. First, we introduce
some notations and we define Kleshchev d-partitions following [6].
    Let λ = (λ(0) , ..., λ(d−1) ) be a d-partition of rank n. The diagram of λ is the
following set:
                          n                                       o
                  [λ] = (a, b, c) | 0 ≤ c ≤ d − 1, 1 ≤ b ≤ λ(c)a    .

    The elements of this diagram are called the nodes of λ. Let γ = (a, b, c) be a
node of λ. The residue of γ associated to the set {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 } is the element
of Z/eZ defined by:
                          res(γ) = (b − a + vc )(mod e).
    If γ is a node with residue i, we say that γ is an i-node. Let λ and µ be two
d-partitions of rank n and n + 1 such that [λ] ⊂ [µ]. There exists a node γ such
that [µ] = [λ] ∪ {γ}. Then, we denote [µ]/[λ] = γ. If res(γ) = i, we say that γ
is an addable i-node for λ and a removable i-node for µ.
    Now, we consider the following order on the set of removable and addable
nodes of a d-partition: we say that γ = (a, b, c) is below γ ′ = (a′ , b′ , c′ ) if c < c′
or if c = c′ and a < a′ .
    This order will be called the AM-order and the notion of normal nodes and
good nodes below are linked with this order (in the next paragraph, we will give
another order on the set of nodes which is distinct from this one).
    Let λ be a d-partition and let γ be an i-node, we say that γ is a normal
i-node of λ if, whenever η is an i-node of λ below γ, there are more removable
i-nodes between η and γ than addable i-nodes between η and γ. If γ is the
highest normal i-node of λ, we say that γ is a good i-node.
    We can now define the notion of Kleshchev d-partitions associated to the set
{e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }:

                                            5
Definition 2.1. The Kleshchev d-partitions are defined recursively as follows.
   • The empty partition ∅ := (∅, ∅, ..., ∅) is Kleshchev.
   • If λ is Kleshchev, there exist i ∈ {0, ..., e − 1} and a good i-node γ such
     that if we remove γ from λ, the resulting d-partition is Kleshchev.
    We denote by Λ0{e;v0 ,...,vl−1 } the set of Kleshchev d-partitions associated to
the set {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }. If there is no ambiguity concerning {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }, we
denote it by Λ0 .
   Now, let h be a free Z-module with basis {hi , d | 0 ≤ i < e} and let {Λi , δ | 0 ≤
i < e} be the dual basis with respect to the pairing:

                                               h , i : h∗ × h → Z

such that hΛi , hj i = δij , hδ, di = 1 and hΛi , di = hδ, hj i = 0 for 0 ≤ i, j < e. For
0 ≤ i < e, we define the simple roots of h∗ by:
                             
                                 2Λ0 − Λe−1 − Λ1 + δ if i = 0,
                      αi =
                                 2Λi − Λi−1 − Λi+1        if i > 0,

where Λe := Λ0 . The Λi are called the fundamental weights.
    Now, let q be an indeterminate and let Uq be the quantum group of type
  (1)
Ae−1 . This is a unital associative algebra over C(q) which is generated by
elements {ei , fi | i ∈ {0, ..., e − 1}} and {kh | h ∈ h} (see for example [28,
chapter 6] for the relations).
    For j ∈ N and l ∈ N, we define:
                       q j − q −j
   • [j]q :=                      ,
                       q − q −1
   • [j]!q := [1]q [2]q ...[j]q ,
              
           l                     [l]!q
   •                   =                   .
           j       q       [j]!q [l − j]!q

    We now introduce the Ariki’s theorem. For details, we refer to [4]. Let
A = Z[q, q −1 ]. We consider the Kostant-Lusztig A-form of Uq which is denoted
                                                                        (l)    el
by UA : this is a A-subalgebra of Uq generated by the divided powers ei := i!
                                                                              [l]q
             l
   (l)     f j
, fj := ! for 0 ≤ i, j < e and l ∈ N and by khi , kd , kh−1  , kd−1 for 0 ≤ i < e
          [l]q                                             i


(see [26, §3.1]). Now, if S is a ring and u an invertible element in S, we can
form the specialized algebra US,u := S ⊗A UA by specializing the indeterminate
q to u ∈ S.
    Let λ and µ be two d-partitions of rank n and n + 1 such that there exists




                                                       6
an i-node γ such that [µ] = [λ] ∪ {γ}. We define:

             Nia (λ, µ) =♯{addable i − nodes of λ above γ}
                             − ♯{removable i − nodes of µ above γ},
              Nib (λ, µ)   =♯{addable i − nodes of λ below γ}
                             − ♯{removable i − nodes of µ below γ},
                 Ni (λ) =♯{addable i − nodes of λ}
                          − ♯{removable i − nodes of λ},
                Nd (λ) =♯{0 − nodes of λ}.
   For n ∈ N, let FnL be the associated space which is defined in the previous
paragraph. Let F := n∈N Fn . F is called the Fock space. For each d-partition
λ, we identify the Specht module S λ with λ so that a basis of Fn is given by
the set Πdn . F becomes a Uq - module with the following action:
                    X          a                     X          b
         ei λ =           q −Ni (µ,λ) µ,   fi λ =            q Ni (λ,µ) µ,
               res([λ]/[µ])=i                            res([µ]/[λ])=i


                       khi λ = q Ni (λ) λ,       kd λ = q −Nd (λ) λ,
where i = 0, ..., e − 1. This action was discovered by Hayashi in [21].
    Let M be the Uq -submodule of F generated by the empty d-partition. It is
isomorphic to an integrable highest weight module (see [9]). Now, this result
allows us to apply the canonical basis theory and the crystal graph theory to
M.
    In particular, the crystal graph gives a way for labeling the Kashiwara-
Lusztig’s canonical basis of M (see [4] for more details).
    Based on Misra and Miwa’s result, Ariki and Mathas observed that this
graph is given by:
   • vertices: the Kleshchev d-partitions,
                i
   • edges: λ → µ if and only if [µ]/[λ] is a good i-node.
   Thus, the canonical basis B of M is labeled by the Kleshchev d-partitions:

                           B = {G(λ) | λ ∈ Λ0{e;v0 ,...,vd−1 } }.
    This set is a basis of the UA -module MA generated by the empty d-partition
and for any specialization of q into an invertible element u of a field R, we obtain
a basis of the specialized module MR,u by specializing the set B.
    Now, we have the following theorem of Ariki which shows that the problem
of computing the decomposition numbers of HR,n can be translated to that of
computing the canonical basis of M. This theorem was first conjectured by
Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon ([24]) in the case of Hecke algebras of type An−1 .
Theorem 2.2 (Ariki [2]). We have Φdn = Λ0{e;v0 ,...,vd−1 } . Moreover, assume
that R is a field of characteristic 0. Then, for each λ ∈ Φdn , there exist poly-
nomials dµ,λ (q) ∈ Z[q] and a unique element G(λ) of the canonical basis such
that:                 X
             G(λ) =       dµ,λ (q)µ     and     G(λ) = λ (mod q).
                      µ∈Πd
                         n




                                             7
Finally, for all µ ∈ Πdn and λ ∈ Φdn , we have dµ,λ (1) = dµ,λ .
    Then, if R is a field of characteristic 0 and if we identify the d-partitions λ
with the modules S λ , we see that the canonical basis elements specialized at
q = 1 corresponds to the indecomposable projective HR,n -modules.
    As noted in the introduction, the problem of this parametrization of the sim-
ple HR,n -modules is that we only know a recursive description of the Kleshchev
d-partitions. We now deal with another parametrization of this set found by
Foda et al. which uses almost the same objects as Ariki and Mathas.

2.3    Parametrization of the simple modules by Foda et al.
The principal idea of Foda et al. ([14]) is to use another structure of Uq -module
over F by choosing another order on the set of the nodes of the d-partitions.
   Here, we say that γ = (a, b, c) is above γ ′ = (a′ , b′ , c′ ) if:

       b − a + vc < b′ − a′ + vc′ or if b − a + vc = b′ − a′ + vc′ and c > c′ .
This order will be called the FLOTW order.
                                               a             b
   This order allows us to define functions N i (λ, µ) and N i (λ, µ) given by the
same way as Nia (λ, µ) et Nib (λ, µ) for the AM order.
   Now, we have the following result:
Theorem 2.3 (Jimbo, Misra, Miwa, Okado [23]). F is a Uq -module with
action:
               X         a                 X         b
        ei λ =      q −N i (µ,λ) µ, fi λ =       q N i (λ,µ) µ,
                res([λ]/[µ])=i                              res([µ]/[λ])=i


                       khi λ = v Ni (λ) λ,        kd λ = q −Nd (λ) λ,
where 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. This action will be called the JMMO action.
    We denote by M the Uq -module generated by the empty d-partition with
the above action. This is a highest weight module and the d-partitions of the
crystal graph are obtained recursively by adding good nodes to d-partitions of
the crystal graph.
    Foda et al. showed that the analogue of the notion of Kleshchev d-partitions
for this action is as follows:
Definition 2.2. We say that λ = (λ(0) , ..., λ(d−1) ) is a FLOTW d-partition
associated to the set {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 } if and only if:
   1. for all 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 2 and i = 1, 2, ..., we have:
                                    (j)       (j+1)
                                   λi     ≥ λi+vj+1 −vj ,
                                    (d−1)         (0)
                                   λi        ≥ λi+e+v0 −vd−1 ;

   2. for all k > 0, among the residues appearing at the right ends of the length
      k rows of λ, at least one element of {0, 1, ..., e − 1} does not occur.
We denote by Λ1{e;v0 ,...,vd−1 } the set of FLOTW d-partitions associated to the set
{e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }. If there is no ambiguity concerning {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }, we denote
it by Λ1 .

                                              8
    Hence, the crystal graph of M is given by:
    • vertices: the FLOTW d-partitions,
                      i
    • edges: λ → µ if and only if [µ]/[λ] is good i-node with respect to the
      FLOTW order.
    So, the canonical basis elements are labeled by the FLOTW d-partitions
and if we specialize these elements to q = 1, we obtain the same elements
as in Theorem 2.2. Hence, there is a bijection between the set of Kleshchev
d-partitions and the set of FLOTW d-partitions.


3       Schur elements and a-functions
The aim of this section is to introduce Schur elements and a-functions associated
to simple modules of Ariki-Koike algebras. It is convenient to express them in
terms of symbols. Most of the results explained here are given in [7]. First, we
give some notations and some definitions:

3.1      Symbols
Let n ∈ N and d ∈ N>0 . The notion of symbols are usually associated to
d-partitions. Here, we generalize it to d-compositions. This generalization is
useful in our argument in the next section. A d-composition λ of rank n is a
d-tuple (λ(0) , ...., λ(d−1) ) where :
                                                             (i)   (i)
    • for all i = 0, ..., d − 1, we have λ(i) = (λ1 , ..., λh(i) ) for h(i) ∈ N and
         (i)
        λj ∈ N>0 (j = 1, ..., h(i) ), h(i) is called the height of λ(i) ,

        d−1
        XX  h(i)
                    (i)
    •              λj = n.
        i=0 j=1

   Let λ = (λ(0) , ..., λ(d−1) ) be a d-composition and let h(i) be the heights of
the compositions λ(i) . Then the height of λ is the following positive integer:

                                 hλ = max{h(0) , ..., h(d−1) }

   Let k be a positive integer. The ordinary symbol associated to λ and k is
the following set:
                            B := (B (0) , ..., B (d−1) ),
where B (i) , for i = 0, ..., d − 1, is given by:
                                              (i)      (i)
                                  B (i) := (B1 , ..., Bhλ +k ),

in which:
                           (i)    (i)
                          Bj := λj − j + hλ + k (1 ≤ j ≤ hλ + k),
        (i)
and λj := 0 if j > h(i) . Note that the entries of each B (i) (i = 0, ..., d − 1) are
given in descending order, contrary to the usual convention.



                                               9
   We denote by hB := hλ + k the height of the symbol B. Now, we fix a
sequence of rational positive numbers:

                                     m = (m(0) , ..., m(d−1) ).

Let k be a positive integer. We define a set B[m]′ associated to m and k by
                      (i)
adding on each part Bj of the ordinary symbol the number m(i) . So, we have:

                                   B[m]′ = (B ′(0) , ..., B ′(d−1) ),

where B ′(i) , for i = 0, ..., d − 1, is given by:
                                                 ′(i)         ′(i)
                                    B ′(i) := (B1 , ..., Bhλ +k ),

in which:
                  ′(i)       (i)
                Bj       := λj − j + hλ + k + m(i) (1 ≤ j ≤ hλ + k).
Note that this set is defined in [7] when the numbers m(i) are integers using the
notion of m-translated symbols.
                                       1
Example 3.1. Let d = 3 and m = (1, , 2). We consider the following 3-
                                       2
partition:
                      λ = ((4, 2), (0), (5, 2, 1)).
Let k = 0. The ordinary symbol associated                to λ is given by:
                             (0)
                             B        =                  6     3    0
                        B=      B (1) =                   2     1    0
                             (2)
                                B      =                  7     3    1

The set B[m]′ associated to λ is given             by:
                             ′(0)
                             B                    =      7   4   1
                   B[m]′ =      B ′(1)             =     5/2 3/2 1/2
                             ′(2)
                                B                  =      9   5   3

3.2     Schur elements
Let HR,n be a semi-simple Ariki-Koike algebra over a field R with parameters
{v; u0 , ..., ud−1 }. HR,n is a symmetric algebra and thus, it has a symmetrizing
normalized trace τ (see [7] and [18, chapter 7] for the representation theory
of symmetric algebras). The Schur elements are defined to be the non zero
elements sλ (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 ) ∈ R such that:
                                       X                1
                             τ=                                      χλ ,
                                             sλ (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 )
                                      λ∈Πd
                                         n



where, for λ ∈ Πdn , χλ is the irreducible character associated to the simple
HR,n -module S λ .
    Now, we give the expressions of these Schur elements. They were conjectured
in [27], calculated in [17] and the following expression is given in [7].


                                                  10
    First, let’s fix some notations: let B = (B (0) , ..., B (d−1) ) be an ordinary
symbol of height h associated to a d-partition λ = (λ(0) , ..., λ(d−1) ) of rank n.
Following [7], we denote:

                                      Y
  δB (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 ) =                         (v α ui − v β uj ),
                                   0≤i≤j<d
                              (α,β)∈B (i) ×B (j)
                                 α>β if i=j
                                  Y
  θB (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 ) =             (v k ui − uj ),
                              0≤i,j<d
                              α∈B (i)

                                             
                                  d         h
                    σB =                + n(d − 1),
                                  2         2
                                                                      
                            d(h − 1) + 1        d(h − 2) + 1             2
                     τB =                  +                   + ... +       ,
                                  2                  2                   2
                           X
                    |B| =      α,
                              0≤i<d
                              α∈B (i)
                                  Y
  νB (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 ) =              (ui − uj )h θB (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 ).
                              0≤i<j<d

Now, we have the following proposition:
Proposition 3.1 (Geck, Iancu, Malle, see [7]). Let S λ be the simple HR,n -
module associated to the d-partition λ and let B be an ordinary symbol associated
to λ, then the Schur element of S λ is given by:
                                                    −n
                                          Y                                      νB (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 )
sλ (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 ) = (v − 1)              ui         (−1)σB v τB −|B|+n                           .
                                                                                 δB (v, u0 , ..., ud−1 )

3.3    a-function for Ariki-Koike algebras
In this paragraph, we deal with the a-value of the simple modules in the case of
Ariki-Koike algebras. Let d and e be two positive integers and define complex
numbers by:
                             2iπ                        2iπ
                   ηd = exp(     )    and     ηe = exp(     ).
                              d                          e
   We fix a sequence of rational numbers m = (m(0) , ..., m(d−1) ) such that we
have dm(j) ∈ N for all j = 0, ..., d − 1. Let y be an indeterminate and let
L := Q[ηd ](y). We consider the Ariki-Koike algebra HL,n defined over the field
L with the following choice of parameters:
                                              (j)
                                  uj = y dm ηdj for j = 0, ..., d − 1,
                                  v = yd.

By Theorem 2.1, HL,n is a split semi-simple Ariki-Koike algebra.Thus, the sim-
ple modules are labeled by the d-partitions of rank n.



                                                      11
   We can now define the a-value of the simple HL,n -modules. Let λ be a
d-partition of rank n and let S λ be the simple module associated to this d-
partition. Let sλ be the Schur element of S λ . This is a Laurent polynomial in
y. Let valy (sλ ) be the valuation of sλ in y that is to say:

                           valy (sλ ) := − min{l ∈ Z | y l sλ ∈ Z[ηd ][y]}

Then, the a-value of S λ is defined by:
                                                               valy (sλ )
                                           a(S λ ) := −                   .
                                                                   d
For all λ ∈ Πdn , a(S λ ) is a rational number which depends on (m(0) , ..., m(d−1) ).
To simplify, we will denote a(λ) := a(S λ ).
Proposition 3.2. Let λ be a d-partition of rank n and let S λ be the simple
HL,n -module.
   Let k be a positive integer and B[m]′ be the set associated to m and k as in
paragraph 3.1. Then, if h is the height of B[m]′ , we have:
                                X                      X
     a(λ) = f (n, h, m) +                min {a, b} −        min {k, m(j) },
                                           0≤i≤j<d                              0≤i,j<d
                                      (a,b)∈B ′(i) ×B ′(j)                      a∈B ′(i)
                                          a>b if i=j                             1≤k≤a


where:
                                d−1
                                X                                              X
      f (n, h, m) = n                 m(j) − τB + |B| − n − h                           min {m(i) , m(j) }+
                                j=0                                           0≤i<j<d
                                 X
                                                         (j)
                          +               min {k, m            }.
                                0≤i,j<d

                               1≤k≤m(i)


Proof. We use Proposition 3.1:
                         d−1
                         X                                             X
            a(λ) = n           m(j) − τB + |B| − n − h                           min {m(i) , m(j) }+
                         j=0                                        0≤i<j<d
                X                                                         X
    +                          min {α + m(i) , β + m(j) } −                       min {k + m(i) , m(j) }.
              0≤i≤j<d                                                   0≤i,j<d
          (α,β)∈B (i) ×B (j)                                            α∈B (i)
             α>β if i=j                                                  1≤k≤α


We have:
 X                                                X                                      X
      min {k + m(i) , m(j) } =                                 min {k, m(j) }−                  min {k, m(j) }.
0≤i,j<d                                        0≤i,j<d                                0≤i,j<d
α∈B (i)                                        α∈B (i)                                α∈B (i)
1≤k≤α                                        1≤k≤α+m(i)                              1≤k≤m(i)


Using the set B[m]′ of paragraph 3.1, we conclude that:
                              X                      X
     a(λ) = f (n, h, m) +              min {a, b} −     min {k, m(j) }.

Remark 3.1. The formula of the a-function does not depend on the choice of
the ordinary symbol.
    The next section gives an interpretation of the parametrization of the simple
modules by Foda et al. in terms of this a-function when the Ariki-Koike algebra
is not semi-simple.


4     Foda et al. d-partitions and a-functions
First, we introduce some definitions:

4.1    Notations and hypothesis
Here, we keep the notations of the previous section. As in the second section,
we assume that we have nonnegative integers :
                          0 ≤ v0 ≤ v1 ≤ ... ≤ vd−1 < e.
Then, for j = 0, ..., d − 1, we define rational numbers:
                                                    je
                                  m(j) = vj −          + se,
                                                    d
where s is a positive integer such that m(j) ≥ 0 for j = 0, ..., d − 1. We have
dm(j) ∈ N for all j = 0, ..., d − 1.
   Let HL,n be the Ariki-Koike algebra over L = Q[ηd ](y) with the following
parameters:
                                         (j)
                          uj = y dm ηdj for j = 0, ..., d − 1,
                          v = yd.
   If we specialize the parameter y into ηde := exp( 2iπ
                                                     de ), we obtain an Ariki-
Koike algebra HR,n over R = Q(ηde ) with the following parameters:
                                   (j)
                             dm
                       uj = ηde ηdj = ηevj for j = 0, ..., d − 1,
                       v = ηe .
This algebra is split but not semi-simple and we will discuss about its represen-
tation theory.
    Here, we keep the notations used at the previous section and we add the
following ones. First, we extend the combinatorial definitions of diagrams and
residues introduced in paragraph 2.2 to the d- compositions of rank n in an
obvious way. Let λ be a d-composition of rank n. The nodes at the right ends
of the parts of λ will be called the nodes of the border of λ.
Example 4.1. Assume that d = 2, v0 =                   0, v1 = 2 and that e = 4. Let
λ = (4.2.3, 3.5), then the diagram of λ is the         following one:
                                                                     
                        0 1 2 3
                                           2            3 0
               λ= 3 0                 ,                              
                                           1            2 3 0       1
                        2 3 0

The nodes in bold-faced type are the nodes of the border of λ.

                                               13
   We will also use the following notations: Let λ and µ be d-compositions of
rank n and n + 1 and let k ∈ {0, ..., e − 1} be a residue.
                       k                                                       (p)
   • We write λ 7→ µ if [µ]/[λ] is a k-node on the part µj .
                     (j,p)

                      k
   • We write λ7→ µ if [µ]/[λ] is a k-node.
   The next paragraph gives combinatorial properties concerning FLOTW d-
partitions.

4.2     Combinatorial properties
First, we give some lemmas:
Lemma 4.1. Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition associated to {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }. Let
                                 (i )       (i )
ξ be a removable node on a part λj11 , let λj22 be a part of λ and assume that:

                      (i )                       (i )
                     λj22 − j2 + vi2 ≡ λj11 − j1 + vi1 − 1 (mod e).

Then, we have:
            (i )      (i )              (i )                            (i )
           λj22 ≥ λj11 ⇐⇒ λj22 − j2 + m(i2 ) + 1 ≥ λj11 − j1 + m(i1 ) .
Proof. Using the hypothesis, there exists some t ∈ Z such that:
                           (i )                        (i )
                          λj22 − j2 + vi2 = λj11 − j1 + vi1 − 1 + te.

a) We assume that:
                           (i )                                  (i )
                          λj22 − j2 + m(i2 ) + 1 ≥ λj11 − j1 + m(i1 ) .

We want to show:
                                                (i )          (i )
                                               λj22 ≥ λj11 .
Assume to the contrary that:
                                                (i )          (i )
                                               λj22 < λj11 .

We have:
                    (i )                        e        (i )               e
                   λj22 − j2 + vi2 − i2           + 1 ≥ λj11 − j1 + vi1 − i1 ,
                                                d                           d
then:
                                                        e          e
                                     −1 + te − i2         + 1 ≥ −i1 .
                                                        d          d
So, we have:
                                                          e
                                           te ≥ (i2 − i1 ) .
                                                          d
We now distinguish two cases.
If i1 ≥ i2 :
Then, we have t ≥ 0 because i2 − i1 ≥ 1 − d, thus:
                              (i )                        (i )
                             λj22 − j2 + vi2 ≥ λj11 − j1 + vi1 − 1,


                                                       14
so:
                                 j1 − j2 ≥ vi1 − vi2 .
Now, we use the characterization of the FLOTW d-partitions:
                                  (i )           (i )
                                 λj22 ≥ λj21+vi                   .
                                                         1 −vi2


We obtain:
                                         (i )           (i )
                                        λj22 ≥ λj11 ,
a contradiction.

If i1 < i2 :
Then, we have t > 0, thus:
                     (i )                       (i )
                   λj22 − j2 + vi2 ≥ λj11 − j1 + vi1 − 1 + e,

so:
                               j1 − j2 ≥ vi1 − vi2 + e.
We use the characterization of the FLOTW d-partitions:
                                 (i )           (i )
                               λj22 ≥ λj21+vi                         .
                                                        1 −vi2 +e


We obtain:
                                         (i )           (i )
                                        λj22 ≥ λj11 ,
a contradiction again.

b) We assume that:
                     (i )                                 (i )
                   λj22 − j2 + m(i2 ) + 1 < λj11 − j1 + m(i1 ) .

We want to show:
                                         (i )           (i )
                                        λj22 < λj11 .
Assume to the contrary that:
                                         (i )           (i )
                                        λj22 ≥ λj11 .

As above, we have:
                                               e
                                te < (i2 − i1 ) .
                                               d
Again, there are two cases to consider.
If i1 > i2 :
Then, we have t < 0, and so:
                     (i )                       (i )
                   λj22 − j2 + vi2 ≤ λj11 − j1 + vi1 − 1 − e,

thus:
                            j2 − (j1 + 1) ≥ vi2 − vi1 + e.
We use the characterization of the FLOTW d-partitions:
                               (i )         (i )
                             λj11+1 ≥ λj12+1+e+vi                         ,
                                                               2 −vi1




                                                 15
so:
                                        (i )            (i )
                                       λj11+1 ≥ λj22 .
Now, ξ is a removable node of λ. Thus, we obtain:
                                        (i )           (i )
                                       λj11 > λj11+1 ,

a contradiction.
If i1 ≤ i2 :
Then, we have t ≤ 0 because i1 − i2 ≥ 1 − d, thus:
                       (i )                       (i )
                      λj22 − j2 + vi2 ≤ λj11 − j1 + vi1 − 1,

so:
                              j2 − (j1 + 1) ≥ vi2 − vi1 .
We use the characterization of the FLOTW d-partitions:
                                (i )            (i )
                               λj11+1 ≥ λj12+1+vi                      ,
                                                              2 −vi1


so:
                                        (i )            (i )
                                       λj11+1 ≥ λj22 .
Now, ξ is a removable node of λ, so:
                                        (i )           (i )
                                       λj11 > λj11+1 .

Again, this is a contradiction.
Lemma 4.2. Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition associated to {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }. We
define:
                                 (0)  (1)        (l−1)
                    lmax := max{λ1 , λ1 , .., , λ1     }
                                                                                  (i )
Then, there exists a removable k-node ξ1 , for some k, on a part λj11 = lmax
which satisfies the following property: if ξ2 is a k − 1-node on the border of a
      (i )
part λj22 , then:
                                         (i )          (i )
                                       λj11 > λj22 .
                                                                           (l )          (l )
Proof. Let λ(l1 ) , ..., λ(lr ) be the partitions of λ such that λ1 1 = ... = λ1 r =
lmax are the parts of maximal length. Let k1 , ..., kr be the residues of the re-
movable nodes ξ1 ,...,ξr on the parts of length lmax . We want to show that there
exists 1 ≤ i ≤ r such that there is no node with residue ki − 1 on the border of
a part with length lmax .
    Assume that, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ r, there exists a node on the border of a part
of length lmax with residue ki − 1.
    Then, there exists a partition λ(ls1 ) , for some 1 ≤ s1 ≤ r, with a k1 − 1-node
on the border of a part of length lmax :




                                                16
                                           ...             ...
                                           ...             ...
                                                         k1 − 1
                                           ...             ...
                         λ(ls1 ) =
                                           ...             ...
                                                          ks1
                                           ...
                                           ...

                                               lmax
We have s1 6= 1, otherwise the nodes on the border of the parts with length lmax
on λ(ls1 ) would describe the set {0, ..., e − 1}. This violates the second condition
to be a FLOTW d-partition.
   We use the same idea for the residue ks1 , there exists λ(ls2 ) , for some 1 ≤
s2 ≤ r, as below:

                                          ...               ...
                                          ...               ...
                                                         ks1 − 1
                                          ...               ...
                        λ(ls2 ) =
                                          ...               ...
                                                           ks2
                                          ...
                                          ...

                                                 lmax

We have s2 6= s1 (for the same reasons as above) and s2 6= 1, otherwise the
nodes on the border of the parts with length lmax on λ(ls2 ) and on λ(ls1 ) would
describe all the set {0, ..., e − 1}. Continuing in this way, we finally obtain that
there exists 1 ≤ sr ≤ r such that:

                             sr ∈
                                / {1, s1 , s2 , ..., sr−1 }.
This is impossible since sr ∈ {1, ..., r} and for all i 6= j, we have si 6= sj .
   So, there exists 0 ≤ i ≤ r such that there is no ki − 1-node on the border of
the parts with maximal length.
Lemma 4.3. Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition associated to {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }. Let
k and ξ1 be as in the previous lemma.
   Let ξ1 , ξ2 ,..., ξs be the removable k-nodes of λ. We assume that they are on
       (i )      (i )           (i )
parts λj11 ≥ λj22 ≥ ... ≥ λjss .
   Let γ1 , γ2 ,..., γr be the k − 1-nodes on the border of λ. We assume that they
are on parts λ(l   1)     (l2 )       (lr )
                 p1 ≥ λp2 ≥ ... ≥ λpr .
                                           (i )         (l )
    We remove the nodes ξu such that λjuu > λp11 from λ. Let λ′ be the resulting
d-partition. Then, λ′ is a FLOTW d-partition associated to {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 } and
the rank of λ′ is strictly smaller than the rank of λ.




                                           17
Proof. The rank of λ′ is strictly smaller than the rank of λ by the previous
lemma. We verify the two conditions of the FLOTW d-partitions for λ′ .

First Condition:
                                  (i)  (l )   (i)  (i+1)
First, we have to verify that if λj > λp11 , λj = λj+vi+1 −vi and if we remove
                    (i)                                               (i+1)
a node from λj , then, we also remove a node from λj+vi+1 −vi . Observe that:

                      (i+1)                                          (i)
                    λj+vi+1 −vi − (j + vi+1 − vi ) + vi+1 = λj − j + vi .

                                                  (i+1)
Thus, the residue on the border of λj+vi+1 −vi is k. Moreover, the associated
node is a removable one, otherwise we would have:
                                      (i+1)                (i)
                                    λj+vi+1 −vi +1 > λj+1 ,

contradicting to our assumption that λ is a FLOTW d-partition.
           (i)    (i+1)         (i+1)         (l )
   Since λj = λj+vi+1 −vi and λj+vi+1 −vi > λp11 , the k-node on the border of
 (i+1)
λj+vi+1 −vi must be removed. So, the first condition of the FLOTW d-partitions
holds for λ′ .

Second Condition :
The only problem may arrive when there exists t ∈ {1, ..., s} such that:
    • if we delete the nodes ξ1 , ξ2 ,..., ξt−1 , the resulting d-partition λ\{ξ1 , ..., ξt−1 }
      satisfies the second condition.
    • λ \ {ξ1 , ..., ξt } doesn’t satisfy the second condition.
This implies that the set of residues of the nodes on the border of the parts of
               (i )
λ with length λjtt − 1 is equal to the following set:

                                    {0, ..., e − 1} \ {k − 1}.
                                                                                              (i )
Note that the second condition is satisfied for all the other lengths than λjtt −1.
For example, this problem occurs when λ is as follows:

                                                                                                    
      ...        ...      ...        ...        ...       ...              ...         ...     ...

                                                                                                    
     ...       k−2                  ...      k2 − 1                       ...       kr − 1          
                                                                                                    
     ...        ...            ,    ...        ...              , ...,    ...         ...           
                                                                                                    
     ...        ...                 ...        ...                        ...         ...           
                                                                                                    
     ...        k2                  ...        k3                         ...          k            
      ...                            ...                                   ...
             (i )                          (i )                               (i )
            λjtt − 1                   λjtt − 1                            λjtt − 1

We want to show that among the residues on the border of the parts of λ′
             (i )
with length λjtt − 1, k does not occur.
    There exists at least one k-node on the border of a part of λ with length
 (i )
λjtt − 1. Such a k-node must be a removable one. If otherwise, we would have

                                                  18
                                                                          (i )
a k − 1-node on the border of a part of λ with length λjtt − 1 contradicting to
our assumption.
             (i )       (l )
    We have λjtt − 1 > λp11 because there is no k − 1-node on parts with length
 (i )                                                                                       (i )
λjtt − 1. So, all the k-nodes on the border of parts with length λj11 − 1 must
be removed. Thus, we do remove all of them.
     Then, the set of residues of the nodes on the border of parts of λ′ with length
 (it )
λjt − 1 is equal to:
                                 {0, ..., e − 1} \ {k}.
Keeping the above example, λ′ is given by:

                                                                                                          
        ...         ...  ...        ...        ...        ...              ...            ...       ...
       ...       k−1               ...        k2         ...              ...            kr        ...    
                                                                                                          
       ...       k1 − 2            ...      k2 − 1                        ...          kr − 1             

Now, we can delete the remaining removable k-nodes of length λjtt without
violating the second condition. Repeating the same argument for those ξu with
 (i )    (l )
λjuu > λp11 , we conclude that the second condition holds.
Thus, λ′ is a FLOTW d-partition.
    Thanks to this lemma, we can now associate to each FLOTW d-partition a
residue sequence which have “good” properties according to the a-function.
    Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition associated to {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }. By using
                                                                              (i )
Lemma 4.2, there exists a removable node ξ1 with residue k on a part λj11 with
maximal length, such that there doesn’t exist a k − 1-node on the border of a
part with the same length as the length of the part of ξ1 .
    Let γ1 , γ2 ,..., γr be the k − 1-nodes on the border of λ, on parts λ(l 1)
                                                                          p1 ≥ λp2
                                                                                   (l2 )

≥ ... ≥ λ(l r)
         pr . Then, Lemma 4.1 implies that:

                   (i )
                 λj11 − j1 + m(i1 ) − 1 > λp(lkk ) − pk + m(lk )            k = 1, ..., r.

    As in Lemma 4.3, let ξ1 , ξ2 ,..., ξu be the removable k-nodes on the border
               (i )   (i )             (i )
of λ on parts λj11 ≥ λj22 ≥ ... ≥ λjuu such that:

                                              (i )
                                             λjuu > λp(l11 ) .

By Lemma 4.1, we have:
        (i )
     λjtt − jt + m(it ) − 1 > λp(lkk ) − pk + m(lk )             t = 1, ..., u            k = 1, ..., r.

   We remove the nodes ξ1 , ξ2 ,..., ξu from λ. Let λ′ be the resulting d-partition.
 ′
λ is a FLOTW d-partition by Lemma 4.3.
   Now the a − sequence of residues of λ is defined recursively as follows:


                                                     19
Definition 4.1. a − sequence(λ) = a − sequence(λ′ ), k, ..., k .
                                                     | {z }
                                                               u

   Note that if we have a − sequence(λ ) = a − sequence(λ′′ ), k ′ , ..., k ′ for some
                                              ′
                                                               | {z }
                                                                       u′
k ′ ∈ {0, 1, ..., e − 1} and u′ ∈ N, then we have k 6= k ′ . Indeed, let ξ1′ be a
                                  (b )
removable k ′ -node on a part λ′ a11 with maximal length, such that there doesn’t
                                                          (b )
exist a k ′ − 1-node on the border of a part of length λ′ a11 . Assume that k = k ′ .
                      (b )   (i )
We can’t have λ′ a11 = λj11 , otherwise ξ1′ = ξt for some t ∈ {1, 2, ..., u}, a
                                  (b )        (i )
contradiction. Thus, we have λ′ a11 < λj11 and as ξ1′ 6= ξt for all t ∈ {1, 2, ..., u},
                                                                         (b )
there exists a k ′ − 1-node on the border of a part of length λ′ a11 in λ′ , a
contradiction again.
Example 4.2. We assume that d = 2, v0 = 0, v1 = 1 and e = 4. The FLOTW
2-partitions are the 2-partitions (λ(0) , λ(1) ) which satisfy:
   • for all i ∈ N>0 :
                                          (0)        (1)
                                         λi       ≥ λi+1 ,
                                          (1)        (0)
                                         λi       ≥ λi+3 ;
   • for all k > 0, among the residues appearing at the right ends of the length
     k rows of λ, at least one element of {0, 1, 2, 3} does not occur.
   We consider the 2-partition λ = (2.2, 2.2.1) with the following diagram:
                                                 
                                          1 2
                              0  1
                                      , 0 1 
                               3 0
                                          3

λ is a FLOTW 2-partition.
    We search the a − sequence of λ: we have to find k ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, u ∈ N>0
and a 2-partition λ′ such that:
                   a − sequence(λ) = a − sequence(λ′ ), k, ..., k .
                                                        | {z }
                                                               u

The parts with maximal length are the parts with length 2 and the residues of
the removable nodes on these parts are 1 and 0.
    For k = 1, we have a part of length 2 with a node on the border which have
k − 1 = 0 (mod e) as a residue.
    So, we have to take k = 0 and we can remove this node as 3-node(s) on the
border have maximal length 1. There is no other removable 0-node in λ, so:
                  a − sequence(λ) = a − sequence(2.1, 2.2.1), 0.
We can verify that the 2-partition (2.1, 2.2.1) is a FLOTW 2-partition.
   Now, the removable nodes on the part with maximal length have 1 as a residue
and there is no 0-node, so:
                a − sequence(λ) = a − sequence(1.1, 2.1.1), 1, 1, 0.
Repeating the same procedure, we obtain:
                      a − sequence(λ) = 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0.


                                          20
   Let λ be a d-composition of rank n and let k be a residue. Following the
notations of paragraphe 4.1, let µ be a d-composition of rank n + 1 such that:
                                                         k
                                                  λ 7→ µ.
                                                     (j,p)

Then, we write:
                                                     k-opt
                                                 λ 7→ µ,
                                                     (j,p)

if we have:
                             (p′ )                   ′         (p)
                           λj ′      − j ′ + m(p ) ≤ λj − j + m(p) ,
                                                                               k
for all d-composition µ′ of rank n + 1 such that λ 7→
                                                    ′ ′
                                                        µ′ .
                                                                         (j ,p )

Remark 4.1. Let k ∈ {0, 1, ..., e − 1}. Assume that λ is a d-partition and that
µ and µ′ are d-compositions such that:

                                     k-opt                           k-opt
                                  λ 7→ µ             and           λ 7→
                                                                      ′ ′
                                                                          µ′
                                     (j,p)                           (j ,p )

This implies that there exists t ∈ Z such that:
                  (p′ )                        (p)
                 λj ′     − j ′ + vp′ = λj − j + vp + te ≡ k (mod e).

Moreover, we have:
                             (p′ )                   ′         (p)
                           λj ′      − j ′ + m(p ) = λj − j + m(p) .

We obtain:
                                            e
                               te = (p′ − p) .
                                            d
Hence, we have p = p′ and since λ is a d-partition, we have (j, p) = (j ′ , p′ ) and
µ′ = µ.
Proposition 4.1. Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition of rank n and let:

                              a − sequence(λ) = s1 , s2 , ..., sn .

Then, there exists a sequence of FLOTW d-partitions λ[0] = ∅, λ[1],..., λ[n] = λ
such that for all l ∈ {0, ..., n − 1}, we have:
                                                sl -opt
                                             λ[l] 7→ λ[l + 1].
                                                (jl ,pl )

Proof. Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition. Assume that:

                    a − sequence(λ) = a − sequence(λ′ ) is , ..., is ,
                                                        | {z }
                                                                                   as


where λ′ is the FLOTW d-partition as in Definition 4.1. Define λ[n − as ] := λ′ .
Then, there exist d-compositions λ[i], i = n − as + 1, ..., n such that
                          is -opt                        is -opt   is -opt          is -opt
              λ[n − as ] 7→ λ[n − as + 1] 7→ ... 7→ λ[n − 1] 7→ λ[n].


                                                         21
(we omit the indices of the nodes here to simplify the notations.)
    We claim that λ[n] = λ. Indeed, by the discussion above Definition 4.1, the
nodes of λ[n]/λ[n − as ] are precisely the nodes of λ/λ′ . Note also that in the
above graph, the nodes are succesively added on the greatest part where we
have an addable is -node. Moreover, as λ is a d-partition, it follows that for all
i ∈ {n − as , n − as + 1, ..., n}, λ[i] is a d-partition.
    Continuing in this way, there exist d-partitions λ[l] (l = 1, ..., n) such that:
     i1 -opt     i1 -opt   i1 -opt         i2 -opt      i2 -opt                  i3 −opt            is -opt
    ∅ 7→ λ[1] 7→ ... 7→ λ[a1 ] 7→ ... 7→ λ[a1 + a2 ] 7→ ... 7→ λ[n] (1).
   By Lemma 4.3 and by definition of the a − sequence, λ[a1 ], λ[a1 + a2 ],...,
λ[n] are FLOTW d-partitions. Now, assume that there exists a d-partition µ
which appears in (1) and which is not a FLOTW d-partition. Then, there exists
r ∈ {1, ..., s} such that:
                                 ir -opt     ir -opt       ir -opt    ir -opt
        λ[a1 + ... + ar−1 ] 7→ ... 7→ µ 7→ ... 7→ λ[a1 + ... + ar ] (2)
We denote ν := λ[a1 + ... + ar−1 ]. Then, we have two cases to consider.
   • If µ violates the first condition to be a FLOTW d-partition, then there
                                                                                              (i)             (i+1)
      exist j ∈ N>0 and i ∈ {0, 1, ..., d − 2} such that µj                                          < µj+vi+1 −vi (the
               (d−1)       (0)
      case µj          < µj+e+v0 −vd−1 is similar to this one). It implies that we have
                                        (i+1)                             (i)              (i+1)
      added an ir -node on νj+vi+1 −vi and that νj = νj+vi+1 −vi . We obtain:
                    (i)                          (i+1)
                  νj − j + m(i) > νj+vi+1 −vi − (j + vi+1 − vi ) + m(i+1) .
                                                                                     (i)
      It implies that we can’t add any ir -node on µj                                       in (2) because we add
                                                                                 ′
                                                                               (i )           ′
      k-nodes by decreasing order with respect to                             νj ′ − j ′ + m(i ) .
                                                                    Thus, λ[a1 +
      ... + ar ] is not a FLOTW d-partition. This is a contradiction.
   • Assume that µ is the first place where the second condition to be a
     FLOTW d-partition is violated. Thus, there exist a1 + ... + ar−1 < j <
     a1 + ... + ar such that µ = µ[j] and µ[j − 1] is a FLOTW d-partition.
                                                                                     (i)
      In (2), we have added an ir -node on a part νj                                       and the set of residues
                                                                                        (i)
      appearing at the right ends of parts of length         + 1 of µ is equal to      νj
      {0, ..., e − 1}. If there is a ir − 1-node on the border of a part of length
                        (i)
      greater than νj which will be occupied before reaching λ[a1 + ... + ar ],
      Lemma 4.1 implies that this node had to be occupied before the ir -node
                      (i)
      on the part νj is added. Thus, the set of residues appearing at the right
                                           (i)
      ends of parts of length νj + 1 in λ[a1 + ... + ar ] is equal to {0, ..., e − 1}.
      This is a contradiction as λ[a1 + ... + ar ] is a FLOTW d-partition.


   Now, we associate a graph with a FLOTW d-partition as follows:
Definition 4.2. Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition of rank n, let s1 , s2 , ..., sn be
its a − sequence of residues. Then by Remark 4.1 and Proposition 4.1, there
exist unique d-partitions λ[l] (l = 1, ..., n) such that:
                            s1 -opt         s2 -opt               sn -opt
                           ∅ 7→ λ[1] 7→ λ[2]... 7→                            λ[n] = λ,
                            (j1 ,p1 )       (j2 ,p2 )             (jn ,pn )


                                                         22
where ∅ is the empty d-partition. We call this the a-graph of λ.
Example 4.3. Assume that d = 2, v0 = 0, v1 = 1 and e = 4. Let λ =
(2.2, 2.2.1).
                a − sequence(λ) = 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0.
Then, the a-graph associated to λ is the following one:

           1-opt          0-opt           0-opt         3-opt             3-opt         2-opt
      (∅, ∅) 7→ (∅, 1) 7→ (1, 1) 7→ (1, 1.1) 7→ (1.1, 1.1) 7→ (1.1, 1.1.1) 7→
            (1,1)         (1,0)           (2,1)         (2,0)             (3,1)         (1,1)

        2-opt                  1-opt                 1-opt                  0-opt
         7→ (1.1, 2.1.1) 7→ (2.1, 2.1.1) 7→ (2.1, 2.2.1) 7→ (2.2, 2.2.1)
        (1,1)                  (1,0)                 (2,1)                  (2,0)

  Now, we deal with a fundamental property concerning the a-graph o f a
FLOTW d-partition. First, we have to show some properties about a-functions.
Definition 4.3. Let µ and ν be d-compositions of rank n. Let Bµ and Bν be
two ordinary symbols of µ et ν with the same height. Let Bµ [m]′ , Bν [m]′ be as
in paragraph 3.1. Then we write:

                                                  µ ≺ ν,

if:                      X                                 X
                                          min {a, b} −              min {k, m(j) } <
                     0≤i≤j<d                             0≤i,j<d
                        ′(i)   ′(j)                          ′(i)
                (a,b)∈Bµ ×Bµ                             a∈Bµ
                    a>b if i=j                            1≤k≤a
                           X                                 X
                                          min {a, b} −                min {k, m(j) }.
                         0≤i≤j<d                           0≤i,j<d
                            ′(i)   ′(j)                        ′(i)
                    (a,b)∈Bν     ×Bν                       a∈Bν
                        a>b if i=j                          1≤k≤a


In particular, if µ and ν are some d-partitions, we have:

                                    µ ≺ ν ⇐⇒ a(µ) < a(ν).

    The following results give the consequences of the properties showed in this
section in terms of a-function:
Lemma 4.4. Let λ be a d-composition of rank n, let B := (B (1) , ..., B (l−1) ) be
an ordinary symbol of λ, let β1 and β2 be two elements of B[m]′ , we assume
that:
                                  β1 < β2 .
Let l ∈ N>0 . We add l nodes to λ on the part associated to β1 . Let µ be the
resulting d-composition of rank n+ l. We add l nodes to λ on the part associated
to β2 . Let ν be the resulting d-composition of rank n + l. Let Bµ and Bν be
the two ordinary symbols of µ and ν with the same height as B and let Bµ [m]′ ,
Bν [m]′ be as in the paragraph 3.1. Then, we have:

                                                  ν ≺ µ.

In particular, if µ and ν are some d-partitions, then:

                                              a(µ) > a(ν).


                                                   23
Proof. We assume that β1 is on B (i1 ) and that β2 is on B (i2 ) . Then, we have:
                   X                         X
                             min {a, b} −         min {t, m(j) }
                         0≤i≤j<d                                0≤i,j<d
                            ′(i)   ′(j)                             ′(i)
                    (a,b)∈Bµ ×Bµ                                a∈Bµ
                        a>b if i=j                               1≤t≤a

                            X                                    X
               −(                          min {a, b} −                     min {t, m(j) }) =
                         0≤i≤j<d                                0≤i,j<d
                    (a,b)∈B ′(i) ×B ′(j)                        a∈B ′(i)
                        a>b if i=j                               1≤t≤a



             X                                                                   X
     =                   (min {a, β1 + l} − min {a, β1 }) −                                min {t, m(j) }.
            a∈B (i)                                                           0≤j≤d−1
           0≤i≤d−1                                                           β1 <t≤β1 +l
         a6=β1 if i=i1



and we have an analogous formula for ν.
Now, for a ∈ B (j) , j = 0, ..., d − 1, we have:
                                            
                                             0                              if a < β1 ,
       min {a, β1 + l} − min {a, β1 } =        a − β1                        if β1 ≤ a < β1 + l,
                                            
                                               l                             if a ≥ β1 + l.
As β1 < β2 , we have:
                             X
                                          (min {a, β1 + l} − min {a, β1 }) >
                            a∈B (i)
                           0≤i≤d−1
                         a6=β1 if i=i1

                              X
                                           (min {a, β2 + l} − min {a, β2 }).
                             a∈B (i)
                            0≤i≤d−1
                          a6=β2 if i=i2


Moreover, min {t, m(j) } ≤ min {t + β2 − β1 , m(j) } implies that:
                  X                          X
                         min {t, m(j) } ≤            min {t, m(j) }.
                     0≤j≤d−1                                  0≤j≤d−1
                    β1 <t≤β1 +l                              β2 <t≤β2 +l




Proposition 4.2. Let λ[n] be a FLOTW d-partition of rank n and s1 , s2 , ..., sn
be its a − sequence of residues. We consider the a-graph of λ[n]:
                                   s1 -opt       s2 -opt             sn -opt
                            (∅, ∅) 7→ λ[1] 7→ λ[2]... 7→                         λ[n],
                                   (j1 ,p1 )     (j2 ,p2 )           (jn ,pn )

where all the d-partitions appearing in this graph are FLOTW d-partitions.
Then, if we have another graph of d-compositions:
                                     1s         2   s         n         s
                            (∅, ∅) ′7→ ′
                                         µ[1] ′7→ ′
                                                    µ[2]... ′7→ ′
                                                                  µ[n],
                                   (j1 ,p1 )     (j2 ,p2 )           (jn ,pn )


we have λ[n] ≺ µ[n] if λ[n] 6= µ[n].




                                                        24
Proof. We will argue by induction on n−r ∈ N. Assume that λ[r −1] = µ[r −1].
We want to show that if we have the following graphs:
                                sr -opt           sr+1 -opt         sn -opt
                   λ[r − 1] 7→ λ[r]                  7→          ... 7→        λ[n]    (1)
                                (jr ,pr )       (jr+1 ,pr+1 )      (jn ,pn )

                              r    s                sr+1              sn
                   µ[r − 1] ′7→   µ[r]            ′
                                                     7→          ... ′7→   µ[n]        (2)
                                ′
                                (jr ,pr )       (jr+1 ,p′r+1 )           ′
                                                                   (jn ,pn )

then λ[n] ≺ µ[n] if λ[n] 6= µ[n].
Assume that n − r = 0:
Assume that λ[n] 6= µ[n]. To simplify the notations, we write λ := λ[n − 1] =
µ[n − 1]. We have:
                           sn -opt                                      n s
                        λ 7→           λ[n]          and            λ ′7→ ′
                                                                            µ[n]
                           (jn ,pn )                                  (jn ,pn )

As λ is a d-partition, by Remark 4.1, we have
                            (p)                            (p′ )                  ′
                           λj − j + m(p) > λj ′                    − j ′ + m(p )
Let Bλ be an ordinary symbol associated to λ. Then, λ[n] and µ[n] are obtained
from λ by adding a node on parts associated to two elements β1 and β2 of Bλ [m]′ .
We have:
                                    β1 > β2 .
We are in the setting of Lemma 4.4, hence:
                                                λ[n] ≺ µ[n].


Assume that n − r > 0:
Let t be such that r − 1 ≤ t < n. If the residues of the right ends of the parts
(jr , pr ) and (jr′ , p′r ) of µ[t] are the same, we say that t is admissible. Let t < t′
be the two first consecutive admissible indices. Suppose that the lengths of the
part (jr , pr ) (resp. (jr′ , p′r )) increases by N (resp. N ′ ) between µ[t] and µ[t′ ]. If
the first node added to µ[t] is on the (jr , pr )-part, we do nothing. Otherwise,
we add N nodes to the (jr′ , p′r )-part and N ′ nodes to the (jr , pr )-part instead of
adding N nodes to the (jr , pr )-part and N ′ nodes to the (jr′ , p′r )-part.
     Next we consider the consecutive admissible indices t′ < t′′ and repeat the
same procedure until we reach the final consecutive admissible indices. Then
we get a new graph as follows:
                              sr -opt              sr+1               sn
                  λ[r − 1] 7→ λ[r]                ′′
                                                    7→          ... ′′7→    ν[n],       (3)
                              (jr ,pr )         (jr+1 ,p′′
                                                        r+1 )
                                                                         ′′
                                                                   (jn ,pn )

In ν[n] and µ[n], only two parts ((jr , pr )-part and (jr′ , p′r )-part) may differ.
    • If (jr , pr ) = (jr′ , p′r ), we conclude by induction.
    • If (jr , pr ) 6= (jr′ , p′r ), to simplify, we write λ := λ[n], µ := µ[n] and ν :=
      ν[n]. Assume that ν 6= µ, then we are in the setting of Lemma 4.4: let
      γ = (γ (0) , ..., γ (l−1) ) be the d-composition defined by:
                        (p)            (p)
                      γj      := µj                                   if (j, p) 6= (jr′ , p′r ),
                        (p′ )           (p′ )
                      γjr′ r := νjr′ r .


                                                      25
                                                                     (p′ )
      Then, µ is obtained from γ by adding nodes on γjr′ r where as ν is obtained
                                                                       (p )
      from γ by adding the same number of nodes on γjr r . Now, we know that:

                           (p )                        (p′ )                  ′
                         λjr r − jr + m(pr ) > λjr′ r − jr′ + m(pr ) .

      This implies:
                           (p )                        (p′ )                  ′
                         γjr r − jr + m(pr ) > γjr′ r − jr′ + m(pr ) .

      This follows from the fact that the residue associated to (jr , pr ) and (jr′ , p′r )
      in λ are the same.
      Thus, ν and µ are obtained from γ by adding the same number of nodes
      on parts associated to two elements β1 and β2 of Bγ [m]′ where Bγ is an
      ordinary symbol associated to γ. The above discussion shows that:

                                            β1 > β2 .

      So, by Lemma 4.4, we have:
                                                ν ≺ µ.
      By induction hypothesis, we have :

                                      λ≺ν         or       λ = ν.

      We conclude that:
                                                λ ≺ µ.



   The following proposition is now clear.
Proposition 4.3. Let λ[n] be a FLOTW d-partition of rank n and let s1 , s2 , ..., sn
be its a − sequence of residues. We consider the a-graph of λ[n]:
                             s1 -opt     s2 -opt           sn -opt
                       (∅, ∅) 7→ λ[1] 7→ λ[2]... 7→                    λ[n]
                             (j1 ,p1 )   (j2 ,p2 )         (jn ,pn )

then, if we have another graph with d-partitions:
                                1 s        2s            n     s
                       (∅, ∅) ′7→ ′
                                    µ[1] ′7→ ′
                                               µ[2]... ′7→ ′
                                                             µ[n]
                             (j1 ,p1 )   (j2 ,p2 )         (jn ,pn )


we have a(λ[n]) < a(µ[n]) if λ[n] 6= µ[n].
    In the following paragraph, we see consequences of this result: we give an
interpretation of the parametrization of the simple modules by Foda et al. for
Ariki-Koike algebras in terms of a-functions.




                                             26
4.3    Principal result
First, recall the FLOTW order given in the paragraph 2.3, we have the following
proposition.
Proposition 4.4. Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition and let γ = (a, b, c), γ ′ =
(a′ , b′ , c′ ) be two nodes of λ with the same residue. Then:
                              ′
b−a+m(c) > b′ −a′ +m(c ) ⇐⇒ γ is below γ ′ with respect to the FLOTW order.

Proof. As γ and γ ′ have the same residue, there exists t ∈ Z such that:

                                  b − a + vc = b′ − a′ + vc′ + te.

Then, we have:
                                                           ′               e
                 b − a + m(c) > b′ − a′ + m(c ) ⇐⇒ (c − c′ )                 < te.
                                                                           d
Then t ≥ 0 and if t = 0, we have c′ > c. So, γ is below γ ′ .
                                                                     (1)
    Now, we consider the quantum group Uq of type Ae−1 as in the paragraph
2.2. Let M be the Uq -module generated by the empty d-partition with respect
to the JMMO action (see paragraph 2.3).
    First, we have the following result which gives the action of the divided pow-
ers on the multipartitions with respect to the JMMO action. The demonstration
is analogous to the case of the AM action (see for example [28, Lemma 6.15] for
d = 1), we give the proof for the convenience of the reader.
Proposition 4.5. Let λ be a d-partition, i ∈ {0, ..., e − 1} and j a positive
integer. Then:
                          (j)
                                 X b
                         fi λ =      q N i (λ,µ) µ,
where the sum is taken over all the µ which satisfy:

                                              i            i
                                           λ |7→ {z
                                                 ... 7→} µ,
                                                      j

and where:
                  X                                                      

N i (λ, µ) :=                ♯                      −♯

                γ∈[µ]/[λ]


Proof. The proof is by induction on j ∈ N>0 :
   • If j = 1, this is the definition of the JMMO action (see paragraph 2.3).
   • If j > 1, let µ be a d-partition such that:

                                                  i            i

                                                      27
        We assume that the nodes γl associated to (rl , pl ), l = 1, ..., j, are such
        that for all l = 1, ..., j − 1, γl is below γl+1 . Let µs , s = 1, ..., j, be the
        d-partitions such that [µs ]/[µs−1 ] = γs .
                                                                                                          b
                                                                                      (j−1)
        By induction, the coefficient of µs in fi            λ is q N i (λ,µs ) . Hence, the
                                           j
                                           X     b           b
                                (j−1)
        coefficient of µ in fi fi     λ is   q N i (λ,µs )+N i (µs ,µ) .
                                                                     s=1
       Now, we define the following numbers:

                                                                                                    j

        Hence, the coefficient of µ in fi fi                                     λ is q N i (λ,µ)         q j+1−2s .
                                                                                                    s=1

        Now, we have               fi fi     λ           =     [j]q fi .        Thus, the coefficient of µ in fi λ is
              b

        q               .


    Now, we have the following result:
Proposition 4.6. Let λ be a FLOTW d-partition and let a − sequence(λ) =

where cλ,µ (q) ∈ Z[q, q −1 ].
Proof. By Proposition 4.3, we have:

                                                                                          X

                                                                         28
where cλ,µ (q) ∈ Z[q, q −1 ]. So, we have to show that:

                                             cλ,λ (q) = 1.

Assume that the last part of the a-graph of λ is given by:

Let µ be a d-partition obtained by removing as is -nodes from λ and assume that
µ 6= ν. Then, by construction of the a − sequence of residues and Proposition
4.4, the nodes γl associated to (rl , pl ), l = 1, ..., as , are the lowest is -nodes of λ
(with respect to the FLOTW order). If µ 6= ν then at least one of the lowest
is -node is a node of µ. When this node is added, the is -node can be added to
two parts, one to obtain µ[t], the other to obtain ν[t] for some t. As we choose
the higher node, this contradicts to the optimality of ν[t]. Hence, we have to
show that:
                                      b
                                  N i (ν, λ) = 0.
There is no addable node of λ below the γl and there is no removable node of ν
below the γl . Hence this is clear.
Remark 4.2. This proposition shows that λ is a FLOTW d-partition if and
only if there exists a sequence of residues i1 , ..., i1 , i2 , ..., i2 , ..., is , ..., is such that
                                            | {z } | {z }                      | {z }

expression fis s fis−1    ...fi1 1 ∅.
    This result is similar to a conjecture of Dipper, James and Murphy ([12]):
in this paper, it was conjectured that λ is a Kleshchev d-partition if and only if
there exists a sequence of residues i1 , ..., i1 , i2 , ..., i2 , ..., is , ..., is such that:
                                      | {z } | {z }                    | {z }

    Now, the next proposition follows from the same argument as [24, Lemma
6.6], the proof gives an explicit algorithm for computing the canonical basis,
which is an analogue of the LLT algorithm (the details of the algorithm will be
published elsewhere).
Proposition 4.7. Following the notations of paragraph 2.2 , the canonical basis
elements of M are of the following form:
                                   X
                            λ+           bλ,µ (q)µ,
                                            a(µ)>a(λ)



                                                   29
where bλ,µ (q) ∈ qZ[q] and λ is a FLOTW d-partition.
   Reciprocally, for any FLOTW d-partition λ, there exists a canonical basis
element of the above form.
Proof. Let µ ∈ Λ1{e;v0 ,...vd−1 } be a FLOTW d-partition and assume that:

                a − sequence(λ) = i1 , ..., i1 , i2 , ..., i2 , ..., is , ..., is .
                                  | {z } | {z }                      | {z }
                                              a1            a2            as

Then, we define:
                                           (a ) (a      )        (a )
                                              s−1
                             A(λ) := fis s fis−1  ...fi1 1 ∅.
By the previous proposition, we have:
                                                   X
                            A(λ) = λ +                      cλ,µ (q)µ,
                                             a(µ)>a(λ)


where cλ,µ (q) ∈ Z[q, q −1 ].
    The A(λ) are linearly independant and so, the following set is a basis of the
UA -module MA generated by the empty d-partition with respect to the JMMO
action:
                               {A(µ) | µ ∈ Λ1 }.
Note that the vertices of the crystal graph of M are given by the FLOTW l-
partitions. Let {Bµ | µ ∈ Λ1 } be the canonical basis of M. There exist Laurent
polynomials mµ,ν (q) such that, for all µ ∈ Λ1 , we have:
                                         X
                                Bµ =            mµ,ν (q)A(ν).
                                         ν∈Λ1

Now, we consider the bar involution on UA , this is the Z-linear automorphism
defined by:
              q := q −1 ,   kh = k−h ,     ei = ei ,    fi = fi .
It can be extended to MA by setting, for all u ∈ UA :

                                           u∅ := u∅.

    The A(µ) are clearly invariant under the bar involution and so are the Bµ
(this is by the definition of the canonical basis, see [4]). Therefore, we have:

                                  mµ,ν (q) = mµ,ν (q −1 ),

for all µ and ν in Λ1 .
    Let α be one of the minimal d-partitions with respect to the a-function such
that mµ,α (q) 6= 0. Then, the coefficient of α in Bµ is:
                                           X
                            bµ,α (q) :=            mµ,ν (q)cν,α (q).
                                          ν∈Λ1

We have:
   • mµ,ν (q) = 0 if a(ν) < a(α).

                                                30
   • cν,α (q) = 0 if a(ν) > a(α) and if a(ν) = a(α) and cν,α (q) 6= 0 then ν = α.
Hence, we have:
                                  bµ,α (q) = mµ,α (q) 6= 0.
Now, as the FLOTW d-partitions are labeling the vertices of the crystal graph
of MA , we have:
                            Bµ = µ (mod q).
Therefore, if µ 6= α, we have:

                                      bµ,α (q) ∈ qZ[q].

Moreover, we have:
                                  mµ,α (q) = mµ,α (q −1 ).
Therefore, we have µ = α and bµ,µ (q) = 1. To summarize, we obtain:
                                            X
                       Bµ = A(µ) +                    mµ,ν (q)A(ν).
                                         a(ν)>a(µ)


The theorem follows now from Proposition 4.6.
   Using the correspondence between the canonical basis elements and the in-
decomposable projective modules, we can reformulate this result as follows.
Theorem 4.1. Let HR,n := HR,n (v; u0 , ..., ud−1 ) be the Ariki-Koike algebra of
type G(d, 1, n) over R := Q(ηde ) and assume that the parameters are given by:

                       v = ηe ,        ui = ηevj j = 0, ..., d − 1,

where ηe := exp( 2iπ
                  e ) and 0 ≤ v0 ≤ ... ≤ vd−1 < e.
          µ
    Let {PR | µ ∈ Λ0 } be the set of indecomposable projective HR,n -modules.
Then, there exists a bijection between the set of Kleshchev d-partitions and the
set of FLOTW d-partitions:
                                  j : Λ0 → Λ1 ,
such that, for all µ ∈ Λ0 :
                          µ                          X
                     e([PR ]p ) = [[S j(µ) ]] +                  dν,µ [[S ν ]].
                                                     ν∈Πdn
                                                  a(ν)>a(j(µ))



   In particular, this theorem shows that the decomposition matrix of HR,n
has a lower triangular shape with 1 along the diagonal.
Remark 4.3. Keeping the notations of the above theorem, we can attach to
each simple HR,n -module M an a-value in the following way:
                          µ
              If M = DR for µ ∈ Λ0 then aM := aS j(µ) = a(j(µ)).

Then, we have:
                              aM = min {aV | dV,M 6= 0}.
We remark that this property was shown in [16] for Hecke algebras where the
a-function was defined in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis.

                                             31
     We have also the following property: for all ν ∈ Λ1 :
                                 −1         X
                     [S ν ] = [Dj (ν) ] +           dν,µ [Dµ ].
                                              µ∈Λ0
                                          a(j(µ))<a(ν )



   In the following section, we see consequences of the above theorem on the
representation theory of Hecke algebras of type Bn .


5      Determination of the canonical basic set for
       Hecke algebras of type Bn
Let W be a finite Weyl group, S be the set of simple reflections and let H be
the associated Hecke algebra defined over Z[y, y −1 ] where y is an indeterminate.
Let v = y 2 . Then, H is defined by:
     • generators: {Tw | w ∈ W },
     • relations: for s ∈ S and w ∈ W :
                              (
                                Tsw                       if l(sw) > l(w),
                      Ts Tw =
                                vTsw + (v − 1)Tw          if l(sw) < l(w).

       where l is the usual lenght function.
Let K = Q(y) and θ : Z[y, y −1 ] → k be a specialization such that k is the field
of fractions of θ(Z[y, y −1 ]). We assume that the characteristic of k is either 0
or a good prime for W . Let HK := K ⊗Z[y,y−1 ] H and Hk := k ⊗Z[y,y−1 ] H.
Then, following [18, Theorem 7.4.3], we have a well-defined decomposition map
dθ between the Grothendieck groups of HK -modules and Hk -modules. For
V ∈ Irr(HK ), we have :
                                        X
                            dθ ([V ]) =       dV,M [M ]
                                      M∈Irr(Hk )


where the numbers dV,M ∈ N are the decomposition numbers (see [18, Chapter
7] for details).
    In [19], Geck and Rouquier have defined a “canonical basic set” B ⊂ Irr(HK )
which leads to a natural parametrization of the set Irr(Hk ).
Theorem 5.1 (Geck-Rouquier [19]). We consider the following subset of
Irr(HK ):

    B := {V ∈ Irr(HK ) | dV,M 6= 0 and a(V ) = a(M ) for some M ∈ Irr(Hk )}

Then, there exists a unique bijection B ↔ Irr(Hk ), V ↔ V , such that the
following two conditions hold:
    (i) For all V ∈ B, we have dV,V = 1 and a(V ) = a(V ).
 (ii) If V ∈ Irr(HK ) and M ∈ Irr(Hk ) are such that dV,M 6= 0, then we have
      a(M ) ≤ a(V ), with equality only for V ∈ B and M = V .


                                         32
The set B is called the canonical basic set.
    From now to the end of the paper, we assume that k is a field of characteristic
0. Then, B has been already determined for all specializations for type An−1 in
[15], for type Dn and e odd in [16] and for type Dn and e even in [22].
    The aim of this section is to find B in the case of Hecke algebras of type Bn .
Let W be a Weyl group of type Bn with the following diagram:

                         v            v          v               v
                          t            t          t   ❵ ❵ ❵       t

    Let H be the correponding Hecke algebra over Z[y, y −1 ]. First, it is known
that HK is semi-simple unless θ(u) is a root of unity. In this case, we have
B = Irr(HK ). For p ∈ N>0 we put ηp := exp( 2iπ      p ), then we can assume that
θ(v) = ηe and that k := Q(η2e ).
    The semi-simple algebra HK is an Ariki-Koike algebra with parameters
u0 = v and u1 = −1 over K. Then, the simple HK -modules are given by
the Specht modules S λ which are labeled by the 2-partitions λ of rank n. Let
λ := (λ(0) , λ(1) ) be a 2-partition and let h(0) (resp. h(1) ) be the height of λ(0)
(resp. λ(1) ). Let r be a positive integer such that r ≥ max{h(0) , h(1) }. Then,
the a-value of the Specht module labeled by λ := (λ(0) , λ(1) ) is given by

                                               Xr
                            1                               (0)  (1)
       a(λ(0) , λ(1) ) := − r(r − 1)(2r + 5) +     (i − 1)(λi + λi + 1)
                            6                  i=1
                             Xr
                                      (0)              (1)
                          +     min{λi + 1 + r − i, λj + r − j},
                              i,j=1

                 (0)                  (1)
where we put λj := 0 (resp. λj := 0) if h(0) < j ≤ r (resp. h(1) < j ≤ r).
This formula is obtained by rewriting that in Proposition 3.2 with the above
choice of parameters. Now, we have two cases to consider.

a) Assume that e is odd. In this case, we can apply results of Dipper and
James: they have shown that the simple Hk -modules are given by the modules
Dλ where λ = (λ(0) , λ(1) ) is such that λ(0) and λ(1) are e-regular. A partition
ν = (ν1 , ..., νr ) where νr > 0 is e-regular if for all i = 1, ..., r, we can not have
νi = νi+1 = ... = νi+e−1 . For λ a e-regular 2-partition and µ a 2-partition, we
denote by dµ,λ the corresponding decomposition number.
    Moreover, Dipper and James have shown that the decomposition numbers
of H are determined by the decomposition numbers of a Hecke algebra of type
An−1 in the following way (see [10] and [13] for a more general case).
    Let 0 ≤ l ≤ n and let H(Sl ) be the generic Hecke algebra of type Al−1 ,
then θ determines a decomposition map between the Grothendieck groups of
HK (Sl ) and Hk (Sl ). The simple modules of HK (Sl ) are given by Specht
modules parametrized by partitions of rank l. The simple modules of Hk (Sl )
are given by the Dλ labeled by the partitions λ of rank l which are e-regular.
Let dλ′ ,λ be the decomposition numbers of H(Sl ) where λ runs over the set of
e-regular partitions of rank l and λ′ over the set of partitions of rank l.




                                            33
   Let λ = (λ1 , ..., λr ) and µ = (µ1 , ..., µr ) be two partitions of rank l. Recall
that we write λ D µ if , for all i = 1, ..., r, we have:
                                             i

                                                   λj ≥         µj .

Then, if λ = (λ(0) , λ(1) ) is a e-regular 2-partition of rank n and µ = (µ(0) , µ(1) )
a 2-partition of rank n, we have, following [10, Theorem 5.8]:
                (
                  dµ(0) ,λ(0) dµ(1) ,λ(1) if |µ(0) | = |λ(0) | and |µ(1) | = |λ(1) |,
        dµ,λ =
                  0                       otherwise.

Assume that |µ(0) | = |λ(0) | and |µ(1) | = |λ(1) | and that dµ(0) ,λ(0) 6= 0, dµ(1) ,λ(1) 6=
0, then following [28, Theorem 3.43] (result of Dipper and James), we have:

                               µ(0) E λ(0)           and         µ(1) E λ(1) .

Then, as in [16, Proposition 6.8], it is easy to see that:

                        a(λ(0) , λ(1) ) ≤ a(λ(0) , µ(1) ) ≤ a(µ(0) , µ(1) ).

    For all e-regular 2-partition λ, we have dλ,λ = 1. Hence, it proves the
following proposition:
Proposition 5.1. Keeping the above notations, assume that W is a Weyl group
of type Bn and that e is odd, then the canonical basic set in bijection with Irr(Hk )
is the following one:

          B = {S λ | λ = (λ(0) , λ(1) ) ∈ Π2n , λ(0) and λ(1) are e-regular}.

   b) Assume that e is even. Then, by using the notations of paragraph 4.1,
                       e
we put v0 = 1 and v1 = . Then, we have:
                       2
                                 m(0) = 1            and         m(1) = 0.

Then, the Ariki-Koike algebra HK,n over K = Q(y) have the following param-
eters:
                                 u0 = y 2 ,
                                                   u1 = −1,
                                                   v = y2.
This is nothing but the one parameter Hecke algebra HK of type Bn . If we
specialize y to η2e , we obtain the Hecke algebra Hk .
   Thus, we are in the setting of Theorem 4.1. Thus, we obtain:
Proposition 5.2. Keeping the above notations, assume that W is a Weyl group
of type Bn and that e is even, then the canonical basic set in bijection with
Irr(Hk ) is the following one:

                           B = {S λ | λ = (λ(0) , λ(1) ) ∈ Λ1{e;1, e } }.
                                                                           2


             (0)    (1)
We have (λ         ,λ     )∈   Λ1{e;1, e }   if and only if:
                                       2



                                                     34
  1. we have:
                                     (0)        (1)
                                    λi     ≥ λi−1+ e ,
                                                      2
                                     (1)        (0)
                                    λi     ≥   λi+1+ e .
                                                     2


  2. For all k > 0, among the residues appearing at the right ends of the length
     k rows of λ, at least one element of {0, 1, ..., e − 1} does not occur.
    Thus, we obtain the parametrization of the canonical basic set for type Bn
in characteristic 0 for all specializations. Note that the canonical basic set for
the exceptional types can be easily deduced from the explicit tables of decom-
position numbers obtained by Geck, Lux and Müller. Hence, the above results
complete the classification of the canonical basic set for all types and all spe-
cializations in characteristic 0.
