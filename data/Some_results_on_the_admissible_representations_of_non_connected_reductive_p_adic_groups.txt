                                                   Abstract. We examine the theory of induced representations for non-connected
                                                   reductive p-adic groups for which G/G0 is abelian. We first examine the structure of
                                                   those representations of the form IndG                  0
                                                                                           P 0 (σ), where P is a parabolic subgroup of G
                                                                                                                                        0
                                                                                                                       0
                                                   and σ is a discrete series representation of the Levi component of P . Here we develop
                                                   a theory of R–groups, extending the theory in the connected case. We then prove
                                                   some general results in the theory of representations of non-connected p-adic groups
                                                   whose component group is abelian. We define the notion of cuspidal parabolic for
                                                   G in order to give a context for this discussion. Intertwining operators for the non-
                                                   connected case are examined and the notions of supercuspidal and discrete series
                                                   are defined. Finally, we examine parabolic induction from a cuspidal parabolic
                                                   subgroup of G. Here we also develop a theory of R–groups, and show that these
                                                   groups parameterize the induced representations in a manner that is consistent with
                                                   the connected case and with the first set of results as well.




                                                                                  1. Introduction
                                               The theory of induced representations plays a fundamental role within representa-
                                            tion theory in general. Within the theory of admissible representations of connected
                                            reductive algebraic groups over local fields, parabolic induction is used to complete
                                            classification theories, once certain families of representations are understood [3,8,9,
                                            10]. The theory of admissible representations on non-connected reductive groups over
                                            nonarchimedean local fields has been addressed in part in [1,4,6,11], among other
                                            places. We will study certain aspects of parabolic induction for disconnected groups
                                            whose component group is abelian.
                                               Let F be a locally compact, non-discrete, nonarchimedean field of characteristic
                                            zero. Let G be a (not necessarily connected) reductive F -group. Thus G is the
                                            set of F -rational points of a reductive algebraic group defined over F . Let G0 be the
                                            connected component of the identity in G. We assume that G/G0 is finite and abelian.
                                               Our goal is to address three major points. The first is an extension of the results of
                                            [6] to the case at hand. This entails a study of induction from a parabolic subgroup

of G◦ to G. In particular, suppose that P ◦ = M ◦ N is a parabolic subgroup of G◦ ,
and let σ0 be an irreducible discrete series representation of M ◦ . We are interested in
the structure of π0 = IndG P ◦ (σ0 ). In [1] Arthur suggests a construction, in terms of the
conjectural local Langlands parameterization, of a finite group whose representation
theory should describe the structure of π0 , when G/G◦ is cyclic. In [6] the case where
G/G◦ is of prime order is studied, and there is a construction, on the group side,
of a finite group RG (σ0 ) which (along with an appropriate 2–cocycle) parameterizes
the components of π0 . It is also shown there that RG (σ0 ) must be isomorphic to
Arthur’s group Rψ,σ0 , if the latter exists. One cannot confirm the existence of Rψ,σ0
without proofs of both the local Langlands conjecture and Shelstad’s conjecture [12]
that Rψ0 ,σ0 is isomorphic to RG◦ (σ0 ). (See [1] for the precise definitions of Rψ,σ0 and
Rψ0 ,σ0 .) Here, by extending the definition of the standard intertwining operators (cf
Section 4) we show we can construct a group RG (σ0 ) in a manner analogous to [6],
and show that it has the correct parameterization properties (cf Theorems 4.16 and
4.17). An argument, similar to the one given in [6] shows that if G/G◦ is cyclic, then
RG (σ0 ) must be isomorphic to Rψ,σ0 , assuming the latter exists (cf Remark 4.18).
   The second collection of results is an extension of some standard results in admis-
sible representation theory to the disconnected group G. In order to develop a theory
consistent with the theory for connected groups, one needs to determine an appro-
priate definition of parabolic subgroup. There are several definitions in the literature
already, yet they do not always agree. We use a definition of parabolic subgroup which
is well suited to our purposes. Among the parabolic subgroups of G we single out a
collection of parabolic subgroups which we call cuspidal. They have the property that
they support discrete series and supercuspidal representations and can be described
as follows. Let P 0 be a parabolic subgroup of G0 with Levi decomposition M 0 N and
let A be the split component of M 0 . Let M = CG (A). Then P = MN is a cuspidal
parabolic subgroup of G lying over P 0 . We also say in this case that M is a cuspi-
dal Levi subgroup of G. Thus cuspidal parabolic subgroups of G are in one to one
correspondence with parabolic subgroups of G0 .
   Using our definitions we can prove the following. Let M be a Levi subgroup of G
and let M 0 = M ∩ G0 .

Lemma 1.1. (i) If M is not cuspidal, then M has no supercuspidal representations,
i.e., admissible representations with matrix coefficients which are compactly supported
modulo the center of M and have zero constant term along the nil radical of any proper
parabolic subgroup of M.
(ii) If M is cuspidal and π is an irreducible admissible representation of M, then π is
supercuspidal if and only if the restriction of π to M 0 is supercuspidal.
(iii) If M is not cuspidal, then M has no discrete series representations, ie. unitary
representations with matrix coefficients which are square-integrable modulo the center
of M.

(iv) If M is cuspidal and π is an irreducible unitary representation of M, then π is
discrete series if and only if the restriction of π to M 0 is discrete series.
  Using Lemma 1.1 it is easy to extend the following theorem from the connected
case to our class of disconnected groups.
Theorem 1.2. Let π be an irreducible admissible (respectively tempered) represen-
tation of G. Then there are a cuspidal parabolic subgroup P = MN of G and an
irreducible supercuspidal (respectively discrete series) representation σ of M such that
π is a subrepresentation of IndG
                               P (σ).

   Let P1 = M1 N1 and P2 = M2 N2 be cuspidal parabolic subgroups and let σi be
irreducible representations of Mi , i = 1, 2, which are either both supercuspidal or
both discrete series. By studying the orbits for the action of P1 × P2 on G, we are able
to extend the proof for the connected case to our situation and obtain the following
theorem.
Theorem 1.3. Let P1 = M1 N1 , P2 = M2 N2 , σ1 , σ2 be as above. Then if π1 =
IndG                     G
    P1 (σ1 ) and π2 = IndP2 (σ2 ) have a nontrivial intertwining, then there is y ∈ G
so that
                           M2 = yM1 y −1 and σ2 ≃ yσ2 y −1 .
  The third question of study is the structure of π = IndG P (σ) when P = MN is a
cuspidal parabolic subgroup of G and σ is a discrete series representation of M. We
show that, as in the connected case, the components of π are naturally parameterized
using a finite group R. As in the connected case we first describe a collection of
standard intertwining operators R(w, σ) which are naturally indexed by w ∈ WG (σ) =
NG (σ)/M, where
                          NG (σ) = {x ∈ NG (M) : σ x ≃ σ}.
We prove that there is a cocycle η so that
              R(w1 w2 , σ) = η(w1, w2 )R(w1 , σ)R(w2 , σ), w1 , w2 ∈ WG (σ).
  Let σ0 be an irreducible component of the restriction of σ to M 0 , and P 0 = M 0 N =
P ∩ G0 . Then σ ⊂ IndM M 0 (σ0 ) so that

                    π = IndG          G     M               G
                           P (σ) ⊂ IndP (IndM 0 (σ0 )) ≃ IndP 0 (σ0 ).

Using the intertwining operators and R-group theory developed earlier for the repre-
sentation IndG
             P 0 (σ0 ), we can prove the following results. First, the collection

                                 {R(w, σ), w ∈ WG (σ)}
spans the commuting algebra of π. Second, let Φ+   1 be the set of positive restricted
roots for which the rank one Plancherel measures of σ0 are zero and let W (Φ1 ) be
the group generated by the reflections corresponding to the roots in Φ1 . Then W (Φ1 )
4                       DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

is naturally embedded as a normal subgroup of WG (σ) and WG (σ) is the semidirect
product of W (Φ1 ) and the group
                      Rσ = {w ∈ WG (σ) : wα > 0 for all α ∈ Φ+
                                                             1 }.

Finally, R(w, σ) is scalar if w ∈ W (Φ1 ). This proves that the operators R(w, σ), w ∈
Rσ , span the intertwining algebra. But we can compute the dimension of the space of
intertwining operators for IndG                                            G
                                P (σ), again by comparison with that of IndP 0 (σ0 ), and
we find that it is equal to [Rσ ]. Thus we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1.4. The R(w, σ), w ∈ Rσ , form a basis for the algebra of intertwining
operators of IndG
                P (σ).

    Just as in the connected case, we show that there are a finite central extension
                               1 → Zσ → R̃σ → Rσ → 1
over which η splits and a character χσ of Zσ so that the irreducible constituents of
IndGP (σ) are naturally parameterized by the irreducible representations of R̃σ with
Zσ -central character χσ .
   Finally, we give a few examples which point out some of the subtleties involved in
working with disconnected groups. For instance, we show that if we do not restrict
ourselves to cuspidal parabolic subgroups, then the standard disjointness theorem for
induced representations fails. Examples such as these show why one must restrict to
induction from cuspidal parabolic subgroups in order to develop a theory which is
consistent with that for connected groups.
   Many interesting problems involving disconnected groups remain. For example,
the question of a Langlands classification is still unresolved, and some of the results
here on intertwining operators may help in this direction. One also hopes to remove
the condition that G/G◦ is abelian, and extend all the results herein to that case.
Problems such as these we leave to further consideration.
   The organization of the paper is as follows. In §2 we give the definition of parabolic
subgroup and prove Lemma 1.1 and Theorem 1.2. The proof of Theorem 1.3 is in
§3. The results on induction from a parabolic subgroup of G0 to G are in §4, and the
results on induction from a parabolic subgroup of G to G, including Theorem 1.4, are
in §5. Finally, §6 contains examples that show what can go wrong when we induce
from parabolic subgroups of G which are not cuspidal.

                                2. Basic Definitions
  Let F be a locally compact, non-discrete, nonarchimedean field of characteristic
zero. Let G be a (not necessarily connected) reductive F -group. Thus G is the set
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS                 5

of F -rational points of a reductive algebraic group over F . Let G0 be the connected
component of the identity in G. We assume that G/G0 is finite and abelian.
   The split component of G is defined to be the maximal F -split torus lying in the
center of G. Let A be any F -split torus in G and let M = CG (A). Then M is a
reductive F -group. Now A is called a special torus of G if A is the split component
of M. (Of course A is an F -split torus lying in the center of M. The only question is
whether or not A is maximal with respect to this property.)
Lemma 2.1. Let A be a special torus of G0 . Then A is a special torus of G.

Proof: Let M = CG (A) and M 0 = CG0 (A) = M ∩ G0 . Write Z(M) and Z(M 0 )
for the centers of M and M 0 respectively. Now A is the maximal F -split torus lying
in Z(M 0 ) and A ⊂ Z(M). Suppose A′ is the maximal F -split torus lying in Z(M).
Then A ⊂ A′ . But A′ is a torus, so it is connected. Hence A′ ⊂ Z(M) ∩ M 0 ⊂ Z(M 0 ).
Thus A′ ⊂ A and so A′ = A is the split component of M.

Remark 2.2. The converse of Lemma 2.1 is not true. For example, let G = O(2) =
SO(2) ∪ wSO(2) where SO(2) ≃ F × is the group of 2 × 2 matrices
                                a 0                                0 1
                                                                      
                   d(a) =             , a ∈ F × , and w =
                                0 a−1                              1 0
satisfies wd(a)w −1 = d(a−1 ), a ∈ F × . Let A = {d(1)}. Then M = CG (A) = G and
Z(M) = {±d(1)}. Thus A is a special torus of G. However M 0 = CG0 (A) = G0 and
Z(M 0 ) = G0 is an F -split torus. Hence A is not the maximal F -split torus in Z(M 0 )
and so is not special in G0 .
   If G is connected, then A is a special torus of G by the above definition if and only
if A is the split component of a Levi component M of a parabolic subgroup of G.
We will define parabolic subgroups in the non-connected case so that we have this
property in the non-connected case also.
   Let A be a special torus of G and let M = CG (A). Then M is called a Levi subgroup
of G. The Lie algebra L(G) can be decomposed into root spaces with respect to the
roots Φ of L(A):
                                                 X
                                L(G) = L(G)0 ⊕         L(G)α
                                                 α∈Φ

where L(G)0 is the Lie algebra of M. Let Φ+ be a choice of positive roots, and let N
be the connected subgroup of G corresponding to α∈Φ+ L(G)α . Since elements of M
                                                 P

centralize A and L(A), they preserve the root spaces with respect to L(A). Thus M
normalizes N. Now P = MN is called a parabolic subgroup of G and (P, A) is called
a p-pair of G. The following lemma is an immediate consequence of this definition
and Lemma 2.1.
6                      DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

Lemma 2.3. Let P 0 = M 0 N be a parabolic subgroup of G0 and let A be the split
component of M 0 . Let M = CG (A). Then P = MN is a parabolic subgroup of G
and P ∩ G0 = P 0.

Lemma 2.4. Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G. Then P 0 = P ∩ G0 is a parabolic
subgroup of G0 .

Proof: Let P = MN be a parabolic subgroup of G and let A be the split component
of M. Let M 0 = CG0 (A) = M ∩ G0 . Let A1 be the split component of M 0 . Then
A ⊂ A1 so that CG0 (A1 ) ⊂ CG0 (A) = M 0 . But A1 is in the center of M 0 , so that
M 0 ⊂ CG0 (A1 ). Thus CG0 (A1 ) = M 0 so that A1 is a special torus in G0 and M 0 is
a Levi subgroup of G0 . Let Φ and Φ1 denote the sets of roots of L(A) and L(A1 )
respectively. For each α1 ∈ Φ1 , the restriction rα1 of α1 to L(A) is non-zero since
CG0 (A1 ) = CG0 (A) = M 0 . Let Φ+ be the set of positive roots used to define N. Then
Φ+                       +
  1 = {α1 ∈ Φ1 : rα1 ∈ Φ } is a set of positive roots for Φ1 and
                              X                X
                                    L(G)α =            L(G)α1 .
                             α∈Φ+             α1 ∈Φ+
                                                   1

Thus P 0 = M 0 N is a parabolic subgroup of G0 .
   We say the parabolic subgroup P of G lies over the parabolic subgroup P 0 of G0 if
P 0 = P ∩ G0 . We will also say the Levi subgroup M of G lies over the Levi subgroup
M 0 of G0 if M 0 = M ∩ G0 . Lemma 2.4 and its proof show that every parabolic (resp.
Levi) subgroup of G lies over a parabolic (resp. Levi) subgroup of G0 .
Remark 2.5. There can be more than one parabolic subgroup P of G lying over a
parabolic subgroup P 0 of G0 . For example, define G = O(2) and G0 = SO(2) as in
Remark 2.2. Then A = {d(1)} and A0 = SO(2) are special vector subgroups of G
corresponding to parabolic subgroups P = O(2) and P0 = SO(2) respectively. Both
lie over the unique parabolic subgroup SO(2) of G0 .
Lemma 2.6. Let P 0 = M 0 N be a parabolic subgroup of G0 and let A be the split
component of M 0 . Let M = CG (A) and let P = MN. Then if P1 is any parabolic
subgroup of G lying over P 0 we have P ⊂ P1 . Further, M is the unique Levi subgroup
lying over M 0 such that the split component of M is equal to A.

Proof: Write P1 = M1 N where M1 lies over M 0 . Let A1 be the split component of
M1 . Then A1 ⊂ A so that M = CG (A) ⊂ CG (A1 ) = M1 . Clearly M1 = M if and only
if A1 = A.

Remark 2.7. Lemma 2.6 shows that there is a unique smallest parabolic subgroup
P of G lying over P 0 . Although it is defined using a Levi decomposition P 0 = M 0 N
of P 0 , it is independent of the Levi decomposition. Recall that if M10 and M20 are two
Levi components of P 0 with split components A1 and A2 respectively, then there is

n ∈ N such that A2 = nA1 n−1 and M20 = nM10 n−1 . Now if Mi = CG (Ai ), i = 1, 2, we
have M2 = CG (A2 ) = nCG (A1 )n−1 = nM1 n−1 , and M2 N = nM1 n−1 N = M1 N since
M1 normalizes N.
  Let Z be the split component of G. We let Cc∞ (G, Z) denote the space of all smooth
complex-valued functions on G which are compactly supported modulo Z. We say
f ∈ Cc∞ (G, Z) is a cusp form if for every proper parabolic subgroup P = MN of G,
                             Z
                                     f (xn)dn = 0       ∀x ∈ G.
                                 N

Let 0 A(G) denote the set of cusp forms on G. We say G is cuspidal if   0
                                                                            A(G) 6= {0}.
We know that every connected G is cuspidal.
Lemma 2.8. G is cuspidal if and only if the split component of G is equal to the
split component of G0 . Moreover, if G is cuspidal, then a subgroup N of G is the
nilradical of a proper parabolic subgroup of G if and only if N is the nilradical of a
proper parabolic subgroup of G0 . If G is not cuspidal, then G has a proper parabolic
subgroup G1 with nilradical N1 = {1}.

Proof: First suppose that G and G0 have the same split component Z. Let f 6= 0 ∈
0
 A(G0). Define F : G → C by F (x) = f (x), x ∈ G0 , and F (x) = 0, x 6∈ G0 . Then
F ∈ Cc∞ (G, Z) and is non-zero. Let P = MN be any proper parabolic subgroup of
G. Then N ⊂ G0 , so for all n ∈ N, x ∈ G, xn ∈ G0 if and only if x ∈ G0 . Thus for
x 6∈ G0 ,                        Z
                                            F (xn)dn = 0
                                        N
while for x ∈ G0 ,
                             Z                    Z
                                     F (xn)dn =         f (xn)dn.
                                 N                  N
   Now P 0 = P ∩ G0 = M 0 N is a parabolic subgroup of G0 . Suppose that P 0 = G0 .
Then P lies over G0 so that by Lemma 2.6, G ⊂ P . This contradicts the fact that P
is a proper parabolic subgroup of G. Thus P 0 = M 0 N is a proper parabolic subgroup
of G0 . Since f is a cusp form for G0 we have
                             Z
                                     f (xn)dn = 0       ∀x ∈ G0 .
                                 N

Thus F is a non-zero cusp form for G.
   The above argument also showed that if P = MN is a proper parabolic subgroup of
G, then P 0 = M 0 N is a proper parabolic subgroup of G0 . Conversely, if P 0 = M 0 N
is a proper parabolic subgroup of G0 and P = MN is any parabolic subgroup of G
lying over P 0 , then clearly P 6= G.
   Conversely, suppose that G and G0 do not have the same split component. Let Z
be the split component of G0 and define G1 = CG (Z). By Lemma 2.6, G1 is a proper
8                     DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

parabolic subgroup of G. Further since G1 lies over G0 its nilradical is N1 = {1}.
Now if F is any cusp form on G and x ∈ G, we have
                                        Z
                              F (x) =        F (xn)dn = 0.
                                        N1
Thus G has no non-zero cusp forms and so is not cuspidal.

Example 2.9. Let G = O(2) as in Remarks 2.2 and 2.5. Then SO(2) is a cuspidal
parabolic subgroup of G and O(2) is not cuspidal.
  We can sum up the proceeding lemmas in the following proposition.
Proposition 2.10. Let P 0 = M 0 N be a parabolic subgroup of G0 . Then there is a
unique cuspidal parabolic subgroup P = MN of G lying over P 0 . It is contained in
every parabolic subgroup of G lying over P 0 , and is defined by M = CG (A) where A
is the split component of M 0 .
   Now that we have parabolic subgroups of G, we want to study parabolic induc-
tion of representations. Many of the most basic notions of representation theory are
defined in [13, chapter 1] for any totally disconnected group. In particular, admissi-
ble representations of G are defined and the following is an easy consequence of the
definition.
Lemma 2.11. Let Π be a representation of G. Then Π is admissible if and only if
Π|G0 , the restriction of Π to G0 , is admissible.
   Further, the results of Gelbart and Knapp regarding induction and restriction be-
tween a totally disconnected group G and an open normal subgroup H with G/H
finite abelian can be applied to G and G0 . If π is any admissible representation of
G0 on V , we will let IndGG0 (π) denote the representation of G by left translations on
H = {f : G → V : f (gg0) = π(g0 )−1 f (g), ∀g ∈ G, g0 ∈ G0 }.
Lemma 2.12. (Gelbart-Knapp [5]) Let Π be an irreducible admissible represen-
tation of G. Then Π|G0 is a finite direct sum of irreducible admissible representations
of G0 . Let π be an irreducible constituent of Π|G0 which occurs with multiplicity r.
Then
                                                   πg
                                             X
                                  Π|G0 ≃ r
                                              g∈G/Gπ
                       g
where Gπ = {g ∈ G : π ≃ π}.

Lemma 2.13. (Gelbart Knapp [5]) Let π be an irreducible admissible representa-
tion of G0 . Then there is an irreducible admissible representation Π of G such that π
occurs in the restriction of Π to G0 with multiplicity r > 0. Let X denote the group
of unitary characters of G/G0 and let X(Π) = {χ ∈ X : Π ⊗ χ ≃ Π}. Then
                             IndG
                                               X
                                G0 (π) ≃ r              Π⊗χ
                                             χ∈X/X(Π)

is the decomposition of IndG                             2                 0
                           G0 (π) into irreducibles and r [X/X(Π)] = [Gπ /G ].

   The following result was proved by Gelbart and Knapp in the case where the re-
striction is multiplicity one [5]. Tadic [14] refined their result in the connected case.
We now prove the more general result.
Lemma 2.14. Suppose that G is a totally disconnected group, and H is a closed
normal subgroup, with G/H a finite abelian group. If Π1 and Π2 are irreducible
admissible reprsentations of G, which have a common constituent upon restriction to
H, then Π2 ≃ Π1 ⊗ χ, for some character χ with χ|H ≡ 1.

Proof: If the multiplicity of the restrictions is one, then this result holds by Gelbart-
Knapp [5]. In particular, if |G/H| is prime, the statement is true. We proceed by
induction. We know the Lemma holds when |G/H| = 2. Suppose the statement is
true whenever |G1 /H| < n. Suppose |G/H| = n. We may assume n is composite, so
write n = km, with 1 < k < n. Let H ⊂ G1 ⊂ G with |G/G1| = k. If Π1 |G1 and
Π2 |G2 have a common constituent, then, by our inductieve hypothesis, there is a χ
with χ|G1 ≡ 1 with Π2 ≃ Π1 ⊗ χ. Since (G/G1ˆ) ⊂ (G/Hˆ), we are done, in this case.
  Now suppose that τ is an irreducible subrepresentarion of both Π1 |H and Π2 |H .
Then, there are constituents Ωi ⊂ Πi |G1 so that τ ⊂ Ωi |H . By the inductive hypothesis
Ω2 = Ω1 ⊗ χ, for some χ of G1 whose restriction to H is trivial. But, since G1 /H ⊂
G/H is abelian we can extend χ to a character η of G/H. Note that (Π1 ⊗ η)|G1
has Ω1 ⊗ χ ≃ Ω2 as a constituent, so, as we have seen above, Π1 ⊗ η ⊗ ω ≃ Π2 , for
some character ω of G whose restriction to G1 is trivial. Thus, the statement holds
by induction.
   Let (π, V ) be an admissible representation of G and let A(π) denote its space of
matrix coefficients. We say π is supercuspidal if A(π) ⊂ 0 A(G). Of course if G is
not cuspidal, then 0 A(G) = {0} so that G has no supercuspidal representations. If
P = MN is any parabolic subgroup of G, define V (P ) = V (N) to be the subspace
of V spanned by vectors of the form π(n)v − v, v ∈ V, n ∈ N. Then we say π is
J-supercuspidal if V (P ) = V for every proper parabolic subgroup P of G. If G
is not cuspidal, then by Lemma 2.8 there is a proper parabolic subgroup G1 of G
with nilradical N1 = {1}. For any admissible representation (π, V ) of G, V (G1 ) =
V (N1 ) = {0} =6 V so that π is not J-supercuspidal. Thus G has no J-supercuspidal
representation.
   Suppose now that G is cuspidal and let (π, V ) be an irreducible admissible repre-
sentation of G. Let (π0 , V ) denote the restriction of π to G0 .
Lemma 2.15. Assume that G is cuspidal. Then π is J-supercuspidal if and only if π0
is J-supercuspidal if and only if any irreducible constituent of π0 is J-supercuspidal.

Proof: Since G is cuspidal, by Lemma 2.8 the set of nilradicals of proper parabolic
subgroups is the same for both G and G0 . Thus π is J-supercuspidal if and only if π0
10                      DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

is J-supercuspidal. Moreover, since by Lemma 2.12 the irreducible constituents of π0
are all conjugate via elements of G, it is clear that π0 is J-supercuspidal if and only
if every irreducible constituent of π0 is J-supercuspidal if and only if any irreducible
constituent of π0 is J-supercuspidal.

Lemma 2.16. Assume that G is cuspidal. Then π is supercuspidal if and only if π0
is supercuspidal if and only if any irreducible constituent of π0 is supercuspidal.

Proof: Let Z denote the split component of G. By Lemma 2.8 it is also the split
component of G0 .
   Assume that π is supercuspidal. Thus A(π) ⊂ 0 A(G). Let f0 be a matrix coefficient
of π0 . Then there is a matrix coefficient f of π so that f0 is the restriction of f to
G0 . Now f ∈ 0 A(G). Since f smooth and compactly supported modulo Z, so is f0 .
Further, by Lemma 2.8 the nilradicals of proper parabolic subgroups are the same for
both G and G0 . Thus f0 will satisfy the integral condition necessary to be a cusp
form on G0 . Hence A(π0 ) ⊂ 0 A(G0 ) so that π0 is supercuspidal.
   Conversely, suppose that π0 is supercuspidal. Let π1 be an irreducible constituent of
π0 . Then π ⊂ IndG  G0 (π1 ) so that every matrix coefficient of π is a matrix coefficient of
the induced representation. But since G0 is a normal subgroup of finite index in G, the
restriction of IndG              0
                   G0 (π1 ) to G is equivalent to
                                                             x
                                                    x∈G/G0 π1 . Thus matrix coefficients of
                                                  P

the induced representation can be described as follows. Let f be a matrix coefficient
of IndG                                                                       x
       G0 (π1 ) and fix g ∈ G. Then there are matrix coefficients fx of π1 , x ∈ G/G ,
                                                                                           0

(depending on both f and g) so that for all g0 ∈ G0 ,
                                               X
                                  f (gg0) =              fx (g0 ).
                                              x∈G/G0

Since π1 is supercuspidal, so is π1x for any x ∈ G/G0 , and so each fx ∈ 0 A(G0 ).
Thus the restriction of f to each connected component of G is smooth and compactly
supported modulo Z. Also, if N is the nilradical of any proper parabolic subgroup of
G, then
                          Z                   X      Z
                               f (gn)dn =                 fx (n)dn = 0
                           N                         N
                                            x∈G/G0

since by Lemma 2.8, N is also the nilradical of a proper parabolic subgroup of G0 .

Proposition 2.17. Assume that G is cuspidal and let π be an irreducible admissible
representation of G. Then π is supercuspidal if and only if π is J-supercuspidal.

Proof: This is an immediate consequence of Lemmas 2.15 and 2.16 and the corre-
sponding result in the connected case.
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 11

  We now drop the assumption that G is cuspidal. Let P = MN be a parabolic
subgroup of G and let σ be an admissible representation of M. Then we let IndG
                                                                             P (σ)
denote the representation of G by left translations on
                                        −1
   H = {f ∈ C ∞ (G, V ) : f (gmn) = δP 2 (m)σ(m)−1 f (g), ∀g ∈ G, m ∈ M, n ∈ N}.
Here δP denotes the modular function of P .
Theorem 2.18. Let π be an irreducible admissible representation of G. Then there
are a cuspidal parabolic subgroup P = MN of G and an irreducible supercuspidal
representation σ of M such that π is a subrepresentation of IndG
                                                               P (σ).

Remark 2.19. We will see in Corollary 3.2 that the group M and supercuspidal
representation σ in Theorem 2.18 are unique up to conjugacy.
Proof: Let ρ be an irreducible constituent of the restriction of π to G0 . Then
π ⊂ IndG                                                                   0 0
          G0 (ρ). Since ρ is admissible, there are a parabolic subgroup P = M N of
                                                                               0
G0 and an irreducible supercuspidal representation τ of M 0 such that ρ ⊂ IndG
                                                                             P 0 (τ ).
Thus
                                                  G0
                      π ⊂ IndG                G                  G
                               G0 (ρ) ⊂ IndG0 (IndP 0 (τ )) ≃ IndP 0 (τ ).
   Let P = MN be the unique cuspidal parabolic subgroup of G lying over P 0 . Let
σ be an irreducible admissible representation of M such that τ is contained in the
restriction of σ to M 0 . By Lemma 2.16, σ is supercuspidal. By Lemma 2.13 applied
to M and M 0 we have
                                IndM
                                                 X
                                    M 0 (τ ) ≃ s         σ⊗η
                                               η∈Y /Y (σ)

where Y is the group of unitary characters of M/M 0 . Since τ is contained in the
restriction of σ ⊗ η to M 0 for any η, all the representations σ ⊗ η are supercuspidal.
Now
                        π ⊂ IndG                   IndG
                                              X
                                 P 0 (τ ) ≃ s          P (σ ⊗ η).
                                             η∈Y /Y (σ)

Thus π ⊂   IndG
              P (σ   ⊗ η) for some η.
   Let A(G) = ∪π A(π) where π runs over the set of all admissible representations of
G. Similarly we have A(G0) and because of Lemma 2.11 it is clear that if f ∈ A(G),
then f |G0 ∈ A(G0 ). Define the subspace AT (G0 ) ⊂ A(G0 ) as in [13,§4.5]. It is the
set of functions in A(G0 ) which satisfy the weak inequality. Define
               AT (G) = {f ∈ A(G) : l(x)f |G0 ∈ AT (G0 ) for all x ∈ G}
where l(x)f denotes the left translate of f by x. In other words, AT (G) is the set of
functions in A(G) which satisfy the weak inequality on every connected component of
G. If π is an admissible representation of G, we say π is tempered if A(π) ⊂ AT (G).
The following lemma is easy to prove using the properties of matrix coefficients of π
and π0 from the proof of Lemma 2.16.
12                       DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

Lemma 2.20. Let π be an irreducible admissible representation of G. Then π is
tempered if and only if π0 is tempered if and only if any irreducible constituent of π0
is tempered.
   Let π be an irreducible unitary representation of G and let Z be the split component
of G. We say that π is discrete series if A(π) ⊂ L2 (G/Z). Every unitary supercuspidal
representation is discrete series since its matrix coefficients are compactly supported
modulo Z.
Lemma 2.21. If G is not cuspidal, then G has no discrete series representations. If
G is cuspidal, then π is discrete series if and only if π0 is discrete series if and only if
any irreducible constituent of π0 is discrete series.

Proof: Suppose that G is not cuspidal. Then the split component Z of G is a
proper subgroup of the split component Z0 of G0 . Let π be any irreducible unitary
representation of G. Then there is an irreducible unitary representation π1 of G0 so
that π is contained in IndG
                          G0 (π1 ). Thus as in the proof of Lemma 2.16, for any matrix
coefficient f of π and any g ∈ G, we have matrix coefficients fx of π1x , x ∈ G/G0 , so
that for all g0 ∈ G0 ,                       X
                                 f (gg0) =       fx (g0 ).
                                                 x∈G/G0

Let ω be the Z0 -character of π1 . Then for any z ∈ Z0 , g0 ∈ G0 , we have
                                                                      ω x (z)fx (g0 ).
                                     X                       X
                       f (gg0z) =            fx (g0 z) =
                                    x∈G/G0                  x∈G/G0

Thus z 7→ f (gg0z), z ∈ Z0 , is a finite linear combination of unitary characters of Z0 ,
and cannot be square-integrable on Z0 /Z unless it is zero. Now if f is square-integrable
on G/Z, then g0 7→ f (gg0) is square-integrable on G0 /Z for all coset representatives
g ∈ G/G0 , and z 7→ f (gg0z) must be square-integrable on Z0 /Z for almost all g0 , so
that f (gg0 z) must be zero for almost all g0 , z, and f = 0.
   Suppose that G is cuspidal. Let π be a discrete series representation of G. Let
f0 be a matrix coefficient of π0 . Then there is a matrix coefficient f of π so that
f0 is the restriction of f to G0 . Since f is square-integrable on G/Z, certainly f0 is
square-integrable on G0 /Z.
   Conversely, suppose that π0 is discrete series. Let π1 be an irreducible constituent
of π0 . For any matrix coefficient f of π we have

                                2
                                                                   |f (gg0)|2 d(g0Z).

As above, for fixed g ∈ G, we have matrix coefficients fx of π1x , x ∈ G/G0 , so that for
all g0 ∈ G0 ,                            X
                               f (gg0) =       fx (g0 ).

since every fx is square-integrable on G0 /Z. Thus f is square-integrable on G/Z.
 The following theorem can be proven in the same way as Theorem 2.18 using Lem-
mas 2.20 and 2.21.
Theorem 2.22. Let π be an irreducible tempered representation of G. Then there
are a cuspidal parabolic subgroup P = MN of G and an irreducible discrete series
representation σ of M such that π is a subrepresentation of IndG
                                                               P (σ).

Remark 2.23. We will see in Corollary 3.2 that the group M and discrete series
representation σ in Theorem 2.22 are unique up to conjugacy.

                                 3. Intertwining Operators
   Let G be a reductive F -group with G/G0 finite and abelian as in §2. If π1 and π2
are admissible representations of G, we let J(π1 , π2 ) denote the dimension of the space
of all intertwining operators from π2 to π1 . We want to prove the following theorem.
   Let (Pi , Ai ), i = 1, 2, be cuspidal parabolic pairs of G with Pi = Mi Ni the corre-
sponding Levi decompositions. Let σi be an irreducible admissible representation of
Mi on a vector space Vi , and let πi = IndG   Pi (σi ), where we use normalized induction
as in §2. Let W = W (A1 |A2 ) denote the set of mappings s : A2 → A1 such that there
exists ys ∈ G such that s(a2 ) = ys a2 ys−1 for all a2 ∈ A2 .
Theorem 3.1. Assume that σ1 and σ2 are either both supercuspidal representa-
tions, or both discrete series representations. If A1 and A2 are not conjugate, then
J(π1 , π2 ) = 0. Assume A1 and A2 are conjugate. Then
                                                          J(σ1 , σ2ys ).
                                                    X
                                    J(π1 , π2 ) ≤
                                                    s∈W

Corollary 3.2. Let σ1 and σ2 be as above. Then J(π1 , π2 ) = 0 unless there is y ∈ G
such that M1 = M2y , σ1 ≃ σ2y .

Corollary 3.3. Let σ1 and σ2 be irreducible discrete series representations, and sup-
pose that π1 and π2 have an irreducible constituent in common. Then π1 ≃ π2 .

Proof: In this case J(π1 , π2 ) 6= 0 so by Corollary 3.2 there is y ∈ G such that
M1 = M2y , σ1 ≃ σ2y . Thus
                                                          y
                        π1 = IndG                G                 G
                                M1 N1 (σ1 ) = IndM2y N1 (σ2 ) ≃ IndM2 N2′ (σ2 )
                   −1
where N2′ = N1y . Now P2 = M2 N2 and P2′ = M2 N2′ are two cuspidal parabolic
subgroups of G with the same Levi component M2 . We will see in Corollary 5.9 that
14                         DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

there is an equivalence R(P2′ : P2 : σ2 ) between π2 = IndG             ′      G
                                                          P2 (σ2 ) and π2 = IndP2′ (σ2 ).
Thus
                                     π1 ≃ π2′ ≃ π2 .


     Let W (σ1 ) = {s ∈ W (A1 , A1 ) : σ1s ≃ σ1 }. We say σ1 is unramified if W (σ1 ) = {1}.
Corollary 3.4. Assume that σ1 is discrete series. Then J(π1 , π1 ) ≤ [W (σ1 )]. In
particular, if σ1 is unramified, then π1 is irreducible.
   In order to prove Theorem 3.1 for discrete series representations we will need the
following results about dual exponents. Let (π, V ) be an irreducible representation
of G and let V ′ denote the algebraic dual of V . For x ∈ G, let π(x)t : V ′ → V ′
denote the transpose of π(x). Let (P, A) be a cuspidal parabolic pair in G. Then a
quasi-character χ of A is called a dual exponent of π with respect to (P, A) if there is
a nonzero φ ∈ V ′ such that for all n ∈ N , a ∈ A,
                                                               1
                          π(n)t φ = φ and         π(a)t φ = δP2 (a)χ(a)φ.                        (∗)
We will write Yπ (P, A) for the set of all dual exponents of π with respect to (P, A).
  Let V = ki=1 Vi be the decomposition of V into G0 invariant subspaces and let πi
            P

be the irreducible representation of G0 on Vi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
Lemma 3.5. Let (P, A) be a cuspidal parabolic pair in G. Then
                                   Yπ (P, A) = ∪ki=1 Yπi (P 0 , A).

Proof: Let χ ∈ Yπ (P, A) and let φ ∈ V ′ be a nonzero functional satisfying (*). Then
there is 1 ≤ i ≤ k such that φi , the restriction of φ to Vi , is nonzero. Now for any
vi ∈ Vi and g0 ∈ G0 we have
                               < πi (g0 )t φi , vi >=< π(g0)t φ, vi > .
Now since N and A are both contained in G0 it is easy to check that
                                                                      1
     < πi (n)t φi , vi >=< φi , vi >   and     < πi (a)t φi , vi >= δ 2 0 (a)χ(a) < φi , vi >   (∗∗)
                                                                      P

for all vi ∈ Vi , n ∈ N, a ∈ A. Thus χ ∈ Yπi (P 0 , A).
   Now assume that χ ∈ Yπi (P 0 , A) for some 1 ≤ i ≤ k. and let φi ∈ Vi′ be a nonzero
functional satisfying (**). Now π is contained in the induced representation IndG
                                                                                G0 (πi )
so we can realize π on a subspace V of
                 H = {f : G → Vi : f (gg0) = πi (g0 )−1 f (g), g ∈ G, g0 ∈ G0 }
with the action of π given by left translation on the functions. Now define φ ∈ V ′ by
                                 < φ, f >=< φi , f (1) >, f ∈ V.
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 15

Then φ 6= 0 and it is easy to check that for all g0 ∈ G0 , f ∈ V , we have
                          < π(g0 )t φ, f >=< πi (g0 )t φi , f (1) > .
From this it easily follows that since φi satisfies (**), φ satisfies (*). Thus χ ∈ Yπ (P, A).


Lemma 3.6. Assume that G is cuspidal and let π be a discrete series representation
of G. Then Yπ (P, A) ∩ Â = ∅ for every cuspidal parabolic pair (P, A) 6= (G, Z).

Proof: This follows easily from Lemma 2.21, Lemma 3.5, and the corresponding
result for connected groups.
   Let (P00 , A0 ) be a minimal p-pair in G0 and let P0 be the cuspidal parabolic subgroup
lying over P00 . We will call (P0 , A0 ) a minimal parabolic pair in G.
Lemma 3.7. Let (P, A) be any parabolic pair in G. Then there is x ∈ G0 such that
P0 ⊂ xP x−1 , xAx−1 ⊂ A0 .

Proof: Let M = CG (A) and let P 0 = P ∩ G0 , M 0 = M ∩ G0 . Let A′ be the split
component of M 0 . Thus A ⊂ A′ . Now (P 0 , A′ ) is a p-pair in G0 so there is x ∈ G0 such
that P00 ⊂ xP 0 x−1 and xAx−1 ⊂ xA′ x−1 ⊂ A0 . Now M0 = CG (A0 ) ⊂ CG (xAx−1 ) =
xMx−1 so that P0 = M0 P00 ⊂ (xMx−1 )(xP 0 x−1 ) = xP x−1 .
   We will say a parabolic pair (P, A) is standard with respect to the minimal parabolic
pair (P0 , A0 ) if P0 ⊂ P and A ⊂ A0 . We say (P, A) is semi-standard with respect to
(P0 , A0 ) if A ⊂ A0 .
   Fix a minimal parabolic pair (P0 , A0 ) of G. Let NG (P0 , A0 ) denote the set of all
elements of G which normalize both P0 and A0 . Write WG (P0 , A0 ) = NG (P0 , A0 )/M00 .
If (P, A) is any parabolic pair of G which is standard with respect to (P0 , A0 ) and
M = CG (A), write NM (P0 , A0 ) = M ∩NG (P0 , A0 ) and WM (P0 , A0 ) = NM (P0 , A0 )/M00 .
Lemma 3.8. We can write P as a disjoint union
                                  P = ∪w∈WM (P0 ,A0 ) wP 0.

Proof: We first prove the result when P = G. Let y ∈ G. Then (yP00y −1, yA0 y −1) is
a minimal parabolic pair in G0 and hence is conjugate to (P00 , A0 ) via an element of
G0 . Thus there is g ∈ G0 such that gy normalizes both A0 and P00 . But then gy also
normalizes M0 = CG (A0 ) and P0 = M0 P00 . Thus gy ∈ NG (P0 , A0 ).
  Thus the coset yG0 has a representative n ∈ NG (P0 , A0 ) which depends only on the
coset w of n in WG (P0 , A0 ). Since NG (P0 , A0 ) ∩ G0 = M00 , n1 , n2 ∈ NG (P0 , A0 )
determine the same coset of G0 in G just in case they are in the same coset in
WG (P0 , A0 ). Thus we have the disjoint union
                                  G = ∪w∈WG (P0 ,A0 ) wG0 .
16                     DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

   Now let (P, A) be arbitrary. There is a subset θ of the simple roots ∆ of (P00 , A0 )
corresponding to P 0 so that P 0 = Pθ0 . Note that WG (P0 , A0 ) acts on ∆ and that
w −1 Pθ0 w = Pwθ0
                  . Let w ∈ WG (P0 , A0 ) and suppose that P ∩ wG0 6= ∅. Let wg0 ∈
P ∩ wG0 , g0 ∈ G0 . Then wg0 normalizes P 0 so that w −1 P 0 w = g0 P 0 g0−1 is conjugate
to P 0 in G0 . But w −1 P 0w = Pwθ 0
                                      is a standard parabolic subgroup of G0 and so
  0            −1
Pwθ  = g0 P 0 g0 = P 0 . Hence g0 ∈ NG0 (P 0 ) = P 0 , wθ = θ, and w has a representative
in P . Hence w normalizes A = {a ∈ A0 : α(a) = 1 for all α ∈ θ}. But NG (A)∩P = M.
Thus w ∈ WM (P0 , A0 ).
   In order to prove Theorem 3.1 we extend the proof of Silberger in [13, §2.5] to the
disconnected case. Fortunately many of the technical results on intertwining forms
needed are proven in [13, §1] for any totally disconnected group and so can be directly
used in our case. We follow Silberger’s notation. Let (P1 , A1 ) and (P2 , A2 ) be cuspidal
parabolic pairs in G. We may as well assume that they are standard with respect to
a fixed minimal parabolic pair (P0 , A0 ).
   We need to study the orbits for the action of P1 × P2 on G given by y · (p1 , p2 ) =
p−1                     0         0   0                           0
 1 yp2 . Recall that G = ∪v P0 vP0 where v runs over W (G , A0 ) = NG0 (A0 )/M0 .
                                                                                         0

Thus, G = ∪w wG0 = ∪w,v wP00 vP00 = ∪w,v P00 wvP00 where w ∈ WG (P0 , A0 ), v ∈
W (G0 , A0 ). Now since P00 ⊂ Pi , i = 1, 2, each double coset P1 yP2 can be represented
by y = wv, w ∈ WG (P0 , A0 ), v ∈ W (G0 , A0 ). Write Wi = WMi (P0 , A0 ), i = 1, 2.
Lemma 3.9. Let O = P1 w0 vP2 be an orbit of P1 × P2 in G where w0 ∈ WG (P0 , A0 )
and v ∈ W (G0 , A0 ). Then for w ∈ WG (P0 , A0 ), O∩wG0 is empty unless w ∈ W1 w0 W2 .
If w ∈ W1 w0 W2 , then O ∩ wG0 = wOw where Ow is a finite union of orbits of
(w −1 P10 w) × P20 in G0 , all of which have fixed dimension dO equal to the dimension of
the orbit O0 = (w0−1P10 w0 )vP20 .

Proof: Using Lemma 3.8 we can write
                            P1 w0 vP2 = ∪w1 ,w2 w1 P10 w0 vw2 P20
where wi ∈ Wi = WMi (P0 , A0 ), i = 1, 2. But
                        w1 P10 w0 vw2 P20 = w(w −1P10 w)w2−1vw2 P20
where w = w1 w0 w2 ∈ WG (P0 , A0 ). Thus w1 P10 w0 vw2P20 ⊂ w1 w0 w2 G0 and for fixed
w ∈ W1 w0 W2 ,
                  P1 w0 vP2 ∩ wG0 = w ∪w2 (w −1 P10 w)w2−1vw2 P20
where w2 runs over elements of W2 such that ww2−1w0−1 ∈ W1 . Finally,
                     (w −1P10 w)w2−1vw2 P20 = w2−1 (w0−1 P10 w0 )vP20w2
so that
                 dim(w −1 P10 w)w2−1vw2 P20 = dim(w0−1 P10 w0 )vP20 = dO .

   Because of Lemma 3.9 each orbit O has a well-defined dimension dO . For each
integer ν ≥ 0, let O(ν) denote the union of all orbits of dimension less than or equal
to ν. Set O(−1) = ∅.
Lemma 3.10. For each ν ≥ 0, O(ν) is a closed set in the p-adic topology. Further, if
O is an orbit of dimension d, then O ∪ O(d − 1) is also closed in the p-adic topology.

Proof: Using Lemma 3.9 we see that O(ν) ∩ wG0 = wOw (ν) where Ow (ν) is the
union of all orbits of (w −1 P10 w) × P20 in G0 having dimension less than or equal
to ν. This set is closed in the p-adic topology by [13, pg. 93]. Thus O(ν) is a
finite union of closed sets, hence is closed. Similarly, if O has dimension d, then
[O ∪ O(d − 1)] ∩ wG0 = w(Ow ∪ Ow (d − 1)) where Ow ∪ Ow (d − 1) is a finite union
of sets of the form O′ ∪ Ow (d − 1) where O′ is an orbit of (w −1 P10w) × P20 in G0 of
dimension d. These are also closed by [13, page 94].
   Let E = V1 ⊗ V2 where Vi is the space on which σi acts, i = 1, 2. Let T be the space
of all E-distributions T 0 on G such that
                                                  1        1
              T 0 (λ(p1 )ρ(p2 )α) = T 0 (δ1 (p1 ) 2 δ2 (p2 ) 2 σ1 (p1 )−1 ⊗ σ2 (p2 )−1 α)
for all (p1 , p2 ) ∈ P1 × P2 , α ∈ Cc∞ (G : E). Here λ and ρ denote left and right
translations respectively and δi is the modular function of Pi , i = 1, 2 The first step
in the proof of Theorem 3.1 is the inequality [13, 1.9.4]
                                       I(π1 , π2 ) ≤ dim T .                                (3.1)
Here I(π1 , π2 ) is the dimension of the space of “intertwining forms” defined in [13,
§1.6]. It is related to the dimension of the space of intertwining operators by I(π1 , π2 ) =
J(π̃1 , π2 ) where π̃1 is the contragredient of π1 . [13, 1.6.2]
  If O is an orbit of dimension d, write T (O) for the vector space of T 0 ∈ T with
support in O ∪ O(d − 1) and Tν for the space of those with support in O(ν). We have
                                                 X
                                          T =         T (O)

and                                       X
                              dim T ≤          dim(T (O)/Td(O)−1 ).                         (3.2)

Lemma 3.11. Suppose that (P1 , A1 ) and (P2 , A2 ) are semi-standard cuspidal para-
bolic pairs in G. Then M1 ∩ P2 = (M1 ∩ M2 )(M1 ∩ N2 ) = ∗ P1 is a cuspidal parabolic
subgroup of M1 with split component ∗ A1 = A1 A2 .

Proof: We know from the connected case [13, p 94] that ∗ P10 = M10 ∩ P20 is a
parabolic subgroup of M10 with split component ∗ A1 = A1 A2 and Levi decomposition
∗ 0
 P1 = (M10 ∩ M20 )(M10 ∩ N2 ). Thus there is a cuspidal parabolic subgroup ∗ P1 of M1
with split component ∗ A1 and Levi decomposition ∗ P1 = ∗ M1 ∗ N1 . Here ∗ M1 =
CM1 ( ∗ A1 ) = CM1 (A1 A2 ) = M1 ∩ CG (A2 ) = M1 ∩ M2 and ∗ N1 = M10 ∩ N2 = M1 ∩ N2 .
18                           DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

Clearly ∗ P1 = (M1 ∩ M2 )(M1 ∩ N2 ) ⊂ M1 ∩ P2 . Thus we need only show that
M1 ∩ P2 ⊂ ∗ P1 .
  Let x ∈ M1 ∩ P2 . Using the Levi decomposition of P2 we can write x = m2 n2 where

(P2 , A2 ) are semi-standard, we have A1 ⊂ A0 ⊂ CG (A2 ) = M2 . Thus a1 n2 a1 n−1   2 ∈ N2

n2 and m2 both commute with a1 so that n2 ∈ M1 ∩ N2 and m2 ∈ M1 ∩ M2 .
   Return to the assumption that (P1 , A1 ) and (P2 , A2 ) are standard with respect to
(P0 , A0 ) and that y ∈ W (A0 ) so that (P2y , Ay2 ) is semi-standard. Using Lemma 3.11
                                                        −1
we know that ∗ P1 = M1 ∩ P2y and ∗ P2 = M2 ∩ P1y are cuspidal parabolic subgroups
of M1 and M2 respectively.
   Let E ′ (y) denote the space of linear functionals φ on E = V1 ⊗ V2 such that

where δ∗i denotes the modular function for                                    Pi and δi the modular function for

                                                          ∗
Proof: Define the homomorphism δ :                            M1 → R∗+ by
                                 1           −1   1            1              −1          1
           δ(m) = δ∗1 (m) 2 δ∗2 (my ) 2 δ1 (m) 2 δ2 (my ) 2 δP1 ∩P2y (m)−1 , m ∈                                    ∗
                                                                                                                        M1 .
By [13, §2.5.2], the restriction of δ to ∗ M1 ∩ G0 is trivial. Now since the quotient of
∗
  M1 by ∗ M1 ∩ G0 is a finite group, δ = 1 on all of ∗ M1 .
     The proof of the following lemma is the same as that of Lemma 2.5.1 in [13].
Lemma 3.13. If φ ∈ E ′ (y), then φ vanishes on V1 ( ∗ P1 ) ⊗ V2 + V1 ⊗ V2 ( ∗ P2 ). Let
m ∈ ∗ M1 , v1 ⊗ v2 ∈ E, and φ ∈ E ′ (y). Then
                                            −1                                1               −1       1
           < φ, σ1 (m)v1 ⊗ σ2 (my )v2 >= δ∗1 (m) 2 δ∗2 (my ) 2 < φ, v1 ⊗ v2 > .
Corollary 3.14. If A1 = Ay2 , then
                                                               −1
                          < φ, σ1 (m)v1 ⊗ σ2 (my )v2 >=< φ, v1 ⊗ v2 >
               ∗
for all m ∈        M1 , v1 ⊗ v2 ∈ E, and φ ∈ E ′ (y).

Proof: As in [13, §2.5.4], A1 = Ay2 implies that                                      ∗
                                                                                          N1 =     ∗

Corollary 3.15. Assume that σ1 and σ2 are either both supercuspidal or both dis-
crete series. Then E ′ (y) 6= {0} implies that A1 = Ay2 .

Proof: This follows as in [13, §§2.5.3, 2.5.5] using Proposition 2.17 and Lemma 3.6.

  The following Lemma is now proven as in [13, §2.5.7].
Lemma 3.16. Assume that σ1 and σ2 are either both supercuspidal or both discrete
series. Let O be an orbit in G of dimension d. Then dim T (O)/Td−1 = 0 unless there
exists y ∈ O such that A1 = Ay2 . If A1 = Ay2 for some y ∈ O, then
                                dim(T (O)/Td−1 ) ≤ I(σ1 , σ2y ).
Proof of Theorem 3.1. Combine equations (3.1) and (3.2) to obtain
                                                 X
                        I(π1 , π2 ) ≤ dim T ≤        dim(T (O)/Td(O)−1 ).
                                                 O

Now using Lemma 3.16, if A1 and A2 are not conjugate, dim(T (O)/Td(O)−1 ) = 0 for
every orbit O so that I(π1 , π2 ) = 0. If A1 and A2 are conjugate we have, again using
Lemma 3.16,
                                                                             I(σ1 , σ2ys ).
                                     X                                 X
             I(π1 , π2 ) ≤ dim T ≤         dim(T (Os )/Td(Os )−1 ) ≤
                                     s∈W                               s∈W

To complete the proof note that J(π1 , π2 ) = I(π̃1 , π2 ), J(σ1 , σ2ys ) = I(σ̃1 , σ2ys ) and π̃1 =
IndG
   P1 (σ̃1 ). Thus the statement with dimensions of spaces of intertwining operators
rather than intertwining forms follows by substituting π˜1 for π1 .

                                                   P 0 (σ0 )

  In this section we will study representations of G which are induced from a parabolic
subgroup P 0 = M 0 N of G0 . Because in this section we will only work with parabolic
subgroups of G0 , we will simplify notation by dropping the superscripts on P 0 and
M 0.
  Let P = MN be a parabolic subgroup of G0 and fix an irreducible discrete series
representation (σ, V ) of M. Define
                                            −1
 HP (σ) = {f ∈ C ∞ (G, V ) : f (xmn) = δP 2 (m)σ(m)−1 f (x) for all x ∈ G, m ∈ M, n ∈ N}
where δP is the modular function on P . Then G acts by left translation on HP (σ)
and we call this induced representation IP (σ). We will also need to consider HP0 (σ) =
                                      −1
  {φ ∈ C ∞ (G0 , V ) : φ(xmn) = δP 2 (m)σ(m)−1 φ(x) for all x ∈ G0 , m ∈ M, n ∈ N}.
G0 acts by left translation on HP0 (σ) and we call this induced representation IP0 (σ).

                                                                        0
   It is well known that the equivalence class of IP0 (σ) = IndG
                                                               P (σ) is independent of
P . But
                                                        G0
                          IP (σ) = IndG          G
                                      P (σ) ≃ IndG0 IndP (σ),

so that the equivalence class of IP (σ) is also independent of P . We denote the equiv-
alence classes of IP (σ) and IP0 (σ) by iG,M (σ) and iG0 ,M (σ) respectively. If π is a
representation of G0 we will also write iG,G0 (π) for the equivalence class of the in-
duced representation IndG  G0 (π).
   We first want to compare the dimensions of the intertwining algebras of iG,M (σ)
and iG0 ,M (σ) . For this we need the results of Gelbart and Knapp summarized in §2
and the following facts.
Lemma 4.1. Suppose π1 and π2 are irreducible representations of G0 . Then iG,G0 (π1 )
and iG,G0 (π2 ) have an irreducible constituent in common if and only if π2 ≃ π1g for
some g ∈ G. In this case they are equivalent.

Proof: For i = 1, 2, write
                                                   X
                             iG,G0 (πi ) = ri                Πi ⊗ χ
                                                χ∈X/X(Πi )

as in Lemma 2.13. Suppose that iG,G0 (π1 ) and iG,G0 (π2 ) have an irreducible constituent
in common. Then Π1 ⊗ χ1 ≃ Π2 ⊗ χ2 for some χ1 , χ2 ∈ X. Now
                                                                                π1g .
                                                                        X
              π2 ⊂ Π2 ⊗ χ2 |G0 ≃ Π1 ⊗ χ1 |G0 ⊂ iG,G0 (π1 )|G0 ≃
                                                                       g∈G/G0

Thus π2 ≃ π1g for some g ∈ G. Conversely, if π2 ≃ π1g for some g ∈ G, then clearly
                           iG,G0 (π2 ) ≃ iG,G0 (π1g ) ≃ iG,G0 (π1 ).



Lemma 4.2. Suppose that for some g ∈ G, both π and π g are irreducible constituents
of iG0 ,M (σ). Then there is x0 ∈ G0 such that gx0 ∈ NG (σ) = {x ∈ NG (M) : σ x ≃ σ}.
Conversely, if π is an irreducible constituent of iG0 ,M (σ) and if g ∈ NG (σ)G0 , then
π g is also an irreducible constituent of iG0 ,M (σ) and π and π g occur with the same
multiplicities.

Proof: Suppose that π, π g ⊂ iG0 ,M (σ). Then since π g ⊂ iG0 ,M g (σ g ), we see that
iG0 ,M (σ) and iG0 ,M g (σ g ) have an irreducible constituent in common. Thus there is
x0 ∈ G0 such that M gx0 = M and σ gx0 ≃ σ, i.e. gx0 ∈ NG (σ). Conversely, if
g ∈ NG (σ)G0 , then the multiplicity of π in iG0 ,M (σ) is equal to the multiplicity of π g
in iG0 ,M (σ)g ≃ iG0 ,M g (σ g ) ≃ iG0 ,M (σ).
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 21

Lemma 4.3. Let π be an irreducible constituent of iG0 ,M (σ) and let Gπ = {x ∈ G :
π x ≃ π}. Then
                           [Gπ /G0 ] = [NGπ (σ)/NG0 (σ)]
where NG0 (σ) = NG (σ) ∩ G0 and NGπ (σ) = NG (σ) ∩ Gπ .

Proof: Consider the mapping from NGπ (σ) to Gπ /G0 given by g 7→ gG0 . Its kernel
is NGπ (σ) ∩ G0 = NG0 (σ). Further, given g ∈ Gπ , π g ≃ π occurs in iG0 ,M (σ), so by
Lemma 4.1 there is x0 ∈ G0 such that gx0 ∈ NG (σ). But π gx0 ≃ π g ≃ π so that
gx0 ∈ Gπ ∩ NG (σ) = NGπ (σ) and gx0 G0 = gG0 . Thus the mapping is surjective.
  Let C(σ) denote the algebra of G-intertwining operators for iG,M (σ) and let C 0 (σ)
denote the algebra of G0 -intertwining operators for iG0 ,M (σ).
Lemma 4.4. dim C(σ) = dim C 0 (σ)[NG (σ)/NG0 (σ)].

Proof: Let                                           X
                                     iG0 ,M (σ) =            mπ π
                                                    π∈S(σ)
be the decomposition of iG0 ,M (σ) into irreducible constituents. For π1 , π2 ∈ S(σ), we
will say that π1 ∼ π2 if there is g ∈ G such that π2 ≃ π1g . Then using Lemma 4.2, we
have π1 ∼ π2 if and only if π2 ≃ π1g for some g ∈ NG (σ). We can write
                                                                          πg .
                                          X                   X

  Now
                                                                                  iG,G0 (π g )
                                                  X                     X
           iG,M (σ) ≃ iG,G0 (iG0 ,M (σ)) ≃               mπ
                                              π∈S(σ)/∼         g∈NG (σ)/NGπ (σ)
                        X                                           X
                  =              mπ [NG (σ)/NGπ (σ)]rπ                      Ππ ⊗ χ

where Ππ is an irreducible representation of G such that π ⊂ Ππ |G0 . Because of
Lemma 4.1, the representations Ππ ⊗ χ are pairwise inequivalent as π ranges over
S(σ)/ ∼ and χ ranges over X/X(Ππ ). Thus
                                         m2π [NG (σ)/NGπ (σ)]2 rπ2 [X/X(Ππ )].
                                  X
               dim C(σ) =
                             π∈S(σ)/∼

But by Lemmas 2.13 and 4.3,
                      rπ2 [X/X(Ππ )] = [Gπ /G0 ] = [NGπ (σ)/NG0 (σ)].
Thus

                                    = [NG (σ)/NG0 (σ)] dim C 0 (σ).


   We now want to find a basis for C(σ). We proceed as in the connected case. Let
A be the split component of the center of M and write a∗C for the dual of its complex
Lie algebra. Each ν ∈ a∗C determines a one-dimensional character χν of M which is
defined by
                              χν (m) = q <HP (m),ν> , m ∈ M.
We write (IP (σ : ν), HP (σ : ν)) and (IP0 (σ : ν), HP0 (σ : ν)) for the induced representa-
tions of G and G0 as above corresponding to σν = σ ⊗ χν . Let K be a good maximal
compact subgroup of G0 with respect to a minimal parabolic pair (P0 , A0 ) of G0 such
that P0 ⊂ P, A ⊆ A0 . Then G0 = KP and we also have the usual compact realization
of IP0 (σ) on HPK (σ) =
{fK ∈ C ∞ (K, V ) : fK (kmn) = σ −1 (m)fK (k) for all k ∈ K, m ∈ M ∩ K, n ∈ N ∩ K}.
The intertwining operators between HP0 (σ, ν) and HPK (σ) are given by
                                    FPK (ν) : HP0 (σ : ν) → HPK (σ),
                       FPK (ν)φ(k) = φ(k), φ ∈ HP0 (σ : ν), k ∈ K.
For all fK ∈ HPK (σ), x ∈ G0 ,
                                                      −1
                     FPK (ν)−1 fK (x) = δP 2 (µ(x))σν−1 (µ(x))fK (κ(x)).
Here for any x ∈ G0 , κ(x) ∈ K, µ(x) ∈ M are chosen so that x ∈ κ(x)µ(x)N.
  Since we don’t know whether there is a “good” maximal compact subgroup for G,
we don’t have a single compact realization for IP (σ). However we can proceed one
coset at a time as follows. Write G as a disjoint union of cosets, G = ∪ki=1 xi G0 . For
any f ∈ HP (σ, ν), 1 ≤ i ≤ k, we can define
                                                      f (x), if x ∈ xi G0 ;
                                                  

Then fi ∈ HP (σ : ν) for each i and f =                     i=1   fi . For each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, define
                                       FPi (ν) : HP (σ : ν) → HPK (σ)
by
                         FPi (ν)f (k) = f (xi k), f ∈ HP (σ : ν), k ∈ K.
Define

Then FPi (ν)FPi (ν)−1 fK = fK for all fK ∈ HPK (σ) and FPi (ν)−1 FPi (ν)f = fi for all
f ∈ HP (σ : ν).
  If P = MN and P ′ = MN ′ are two parabolic subgroups of G0 with Levi component
M, then we have the formal intertwining operators
                       J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : ν) : HP0 (σ : ν) → HP0 ′ (σ : ν)
given by the standard integral formula
                                                  Z
                   J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : ν)φ(x) =               φ(xn)dn, x ∈ G0 .
                                                    N ∩N ′

Here MN is the opposite parabolic to P and dn is normalized Haar measure on N ∩N ′ .
We can define
                        J(P ′ : P : σ : ν) : HP (σ : ν) → HP ′ (σ : ν)
by the same formula
                                                  Z
                           ′
                     J(P : P : σ : ν)f (x) =                 f (xn)dn, x ∈ G.
                                                    N ∩N ′

In order to talk rigorously about holomorphicity and analytic continuation of these
operators we transfer them to the compact realizations. Thus we have
                                0
                               JK (P ′ : P : σ : ν) : HPK (σ) → HPK (σ)

Theorem 4.5. (Harish-Chandra [7,13]) Suppose σ is an irreducible discrete series
representation of M. There is a chamber a∗C (P ′ : P ) in a∗C such that for ν ∈ a∗C (P ′ : P )
the formal intertwining operator J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : ν) converges and defines a bounded
operator. For a fixed fK ∈ HPK (σ), the mapping
                                           0

from a∗C (P ′ : P ) to HPK (σ) is holomorphic. Further, it extends to a meromorphic
function on all of a∗C .
  Because of Harish-Chandra’s theorem we can define J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : ν) for all ν ∈ a∗C
by
                                                     0

Corollary 4.6. Suppose σ is an irreducible discrete series representation of M. Then
the formal intertwining operator J(P ′ : P : σ : ν) converges and defines a bounded
operator for ν ∈ a∗C (P ′ : P ). Further, for all ν ∈ a∗C (P ′ : P ), we have
                                            k
                    J(P ′ : P : σ : ν) =                       0

                                            i=1


Proof: It is clear from the definitions that for ν ∈ a∗C (P ′ : P ), f ∈ HP (σ : ν), x ∈
G, x0 ∈ G0 ,
                  J(P ′ : P : σ : ν)f (xx0 ) = J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : ν)φ(x0 )
where φ = l(x−1 )f |G0 is the restriction to G0 of the left translate of f by x−1 . Thus
the integral converges. Fix 1 ≤ i ≤ k. An elementary calculation shows that
                      FPi ′ (ν)J(P ′ : P : σ : ν)FPi (ν)−1 = JK
                                                              0

Thus for any f ∈ HP (σ), since clearly J(P ′ : P : σ : ν)(fi ) = (J(P ′ : P : σ : ν)f )i we
have
                                      0

   Because of Corollary 4.6 we can define J(P ′ : P : σ : ν) for all ν ∈ a∗C by the
formula
                                            k
                    J(P ′ : P : σ : ν) =                       0

Corollary 4.7. Let ν ∈ a∗C , f ∈ HP (σ : ν), x ∈ G, x0 ∈ G0 . Then
                        J(P ′ : P : σ : ν)f (xx0 ) = J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : ν)φ(x0 )
where φ = l(x−1 )f |G0 .

Proof: Suppose that 1 ≤ j ≤ k. Because J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : ν) commutes with the left
action of G0 , it is enough to prove the result for x = xj . For any ν ∈ a∗C , f ∈ HP (σ :

   Fix scalar normalizing factors r(P ′ : P : σ : ν) as in [2] used to define the normalized
intertwining operators
                     R0 (P ′ : P : σ) = r(P ′ : P : σ : 0)−1 J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : 0).
Using Corollary 4.7, the fact that r(P ′ : P : σ : ν)−1 J 0 (P ′ : P : σ : ν) is holomorphic
and non-zero at ν = 0 will imply that r(P ′ : P : σ : ν)−1 J(P ′ : P : σ : ν) is also
holomorphic and non-zero at ν = 0. Thus we can use the same normalizing factors to
define
                 R(P ′ : P : σ) = r(P ′ : P : σ : 0)−1 J(P ′ : P : σ : 0).
For the normalized intertwining operators we will also have the formula
                          R(P ′ : P : σ)f (xx0 ) = R0 (P ′ : P : σ)φ(x0 )
where notation is as in Corollary 4.7.
Lemma 4.8. Suppose P1 , P2 , and P3 are parabolic subgroups of G0 with Levi com-
ponent M. Then R(P1 : P3 : σ) = R(P1 : P2 : σ)R(P2 : P3 : σ).

Proof: This follows easily using Corollary 4.7 from the corresponding formula for the
connected case.

Lemma 4.9. Suppose P1 and P2 are parabolic subgroups of G0 with Levi component
M. Then R(P2 : P1 : σ) is an equivalence from HP1 (σ) onto HP2 (σ).

Proof: It follows from Lemma 4.8 that
                         R(P1 : P2 : σ)R(P2 : P1 : σ) = R(P1 : P1 : σ).
But it follows from the integral formula that J(P1 : P1 : σ : ν) is the identity operator
for ν in the region of convergence, and hence for all ν. Thus R(P1 : P1 : σ) is a
non-zero constant times the identity operator and so R(P2 : P1 : σ) is invertible.
  Let x ∈ NG (M). Then if P1 = MN1 is a parabolic subgroup of G0 with Levi
component M, so is P2 = xP x−1 = xMx−1 xN1 x−1 = MN2 . Let dn1 and dn2 denote
normalized Haar measure on N1 and N2 respectively. (Thus dni assigns measure one
to K ∩ Ni , i = 1, 2.) Define αP1 (x) ∈ R+ by
                 Z                            Z
                        φ(n2 )dn2 = αP1 (x)         φ(xn1 x−1 )dn1 , φ ∈ Cc∞ (N2 ).
                 N2                            N1

For all m ∈ M,
                                         αP1 (m) = δP1 (m).
Further, if x ∈ NG (K) ∩ NG (M), then αP1 (x) = 1. The following lemma is an easy
consequence of the definition.

Lemma 4.10. Let x, y ∈ NG (M). Then
                                αP (yx) = αxP x−1 (y)αP (x).
Moreover if m ∈ M, y ∈ NG (M), then
                                  αP (ym) = αP (y)δP (m).
  Now let NG (σ) = {g ∈ NG (M) : σ g ≃ σ} and let WG (σ) = NG (σ)/M. Let
WG0 (σ) = (NG (σ) ∩ G0 )/M. If w ∈ WG (σ), σ can be extended to a representation of
the group Mw generated by M and any representative nw for w in NG (σ). Fix such
an extension and denote it by σw . Now we can define an intertwining operator
                              AP (w) : Hw−1 P w (σ) → HP (σ)
by
                                                                 1
                     (AP (w)f )(x) = σw (nw )αw−1 P w (nw ) 2 f (xnw ).
The αw−1 P w term is not used in the connected case because coset representatives nw
can be chosen in K where αw−1 P w = 1. In the general case we don’t know if there is
a natural choice of coset representatives with αw−1 P w = 1. Thus we add the αw−1 P w
term so that AP (w) is independent of the coset representative nw for w. AP (w) does
however depend on the choice of the extension σw .
Lemma 4.11. The intertwining operator AP (w) is independent of the choice of coset
representative nw for w ∈ WG (σ). For w1 , w2 ∈ WG (σ) there is a non-zero complex
constant cP (w1 , w2 ) so that
                      AP (w1 w2 ) = cP (w1 , w2)AP (w1 )Aw−1 P w1 (w2 ).
                                                             1


Proof: Using Lemma 4.10 we have for any m ∈ M, f ∈ Hw−1 P w (σ),
                                                         1
                            σw (nw m)αw−1 P w (nw m) 2 f (xnw m)
                                       1             1                      1
         = σw (nw )σ(m)αw−1 P w (nw ) 2 δw−1 P w (m) 2 σ(m)−1 δw−1 P w (m)− 2 f (xnw )
                                                         1
                             = σw (nw )αw−1 P w (nw ) 2 f (xnw ).
Thus the intertwining operator is independent of the choice of coset representative.
  Let w1 , w2 ∈ WG (σ) and fix coset representatives n1 , n2 for w1 , w2 respectively. Then
we can use n1 n2 as a coset representative for w1 w2 . We will also write P1 = w1−1P w1
and P12 = w2−1w1−1 P w1 w2 . For any w ∈ WG (σ) and representative nw for w we have
                          σw (nw )σ(m)σw (nw )−1 = σ(nw mn−1
                                                          w )

for all m ∈ M. Thus
                             σw1 w2 (n1 n2 )σw2 (n2 )−1 σw1 (n1 )−1
is a non-zero self-intertwining operator for σ and hence there is a non-zero constant c
so that
                             σw1 w2 (n1 n2 ) = cσw1 (n1 )σw2 (n2 ).

                                αP12 (n1 n2 ) = αP1 (n1 )αP12 (n2 ).
  By definition, for any x ∈ G, f ∈ HP12 (σ),
                                                                       1

  If w ∈ WG0 (σ) and nw is chosen to be in K, then we also have
                                 A0 (w) : Hw0 −1 P w (σ) → HP0 (σ)
given by
                                (A0 (w)φ)(x) = σw (nw )φ(xnw ).
The compositions
                R0 (w0 , σ) = A0 (w0 )R0 (w0−1 P w0 : P : σ), w0 ∈ WG0 (σ),
                    R(w, σ) = AP (w)R(w −1P w : P : σ), w ∈ WG (σ),
give self-intertwining operators for IP0 (σ) and IP (σ) respectively.
Lemma 4.12. There is a cocycle η so that
                          R(w1 w2 , σ) = η(w1 , w2 )R(w1 , σ)R(w2 , σ)
for all w1 , w2 ∈ WG (σ).

Proof: Using Lemmas 4.8 and 4.11, we have
                   R(w1 w2 , σ) = AP (w1 w2 )R(w2−1 w1−1P w1 w2 : P : σ)
= cP (w1 , w2 )AP (w1 )Aw−1 P w1 (w2 )R(w2−1 w1−1P w1 w2 : w2−1P w2 : σ)R(w2−1 P w2 : P : σ).
                            1

We will show that there is a non-zero constant c′P (w1 , w2 ) so that
                Aw−1 P w1 (w2 )R(w2−1 w1−1 P w1w2 : w2−1 P w2 : σ)AP (w2 )−1
                   1

                          = c′P (w1 , w2 )R(w1−1P w1 : P : σ).
When this is established we will have R(w1 w2 , σ) =
      cP (w1 , w2 )c′P (w1 , w2 )AP (w1 )R(w1−1 P w1 : P : σ)AP (w2 )R(w2−1P w2 : P : σ)
                       = cP (w1 , w2)c′P (w1 , w2 )R(w1 , σ)R(w2 , σ).
Thus η can be defined by η(w1 , w2 ) = cP (w1 , w2)c′P (w1 , w2 ). It is immediate from the
formulas for the composition of the operators R(wi , σ) that η is a 2–cocycle.
   In order to prove the above identity we need to go back to the original definition of
the standard intertwining operators. WG (σ) acts on a∗C and χν (n−1       w mnw ) = χwν (m)

if nw is any representative of w ∈ WG (σ). Now for any ν ∈ a∗C , f ∈ Hw−1 P w (σ, ν), x ∈

Thus AP (w) maps Hw−1 P w (σ, ν) to HP (σ, wν). Now write P1 = w1−1 P w1, P2 =
w2−1 P w2,
P12 = w2−1 w1−1P w1 w2 and consider the composition

for all ν in the region of convergence for the integral formula for J(P12 : P2 : σ : w2−1ν).
By analytic continuation, the identity is valid for all ν. Now divide both sides of the
equation by r(P12 : P2 : σ : w2−1 ν) and evaluate at ν = 0. We obtain

   For φ ∈ HP0 (σ) define f = Φ(φ) ∈ HP (σ) such that f (x) = 0 if x 6∈ G0 and
f (x0 ) = φ(x0 ) if x0 ∈ G0 .
Lemma 4.13. Let f = Φ(φ) as above. Then for all w, w1 ∈ WG (σ), x0 ∈ G0 ,
                                             R(w, σ)f (x0 n−1

                                 1


Proof: For any x ∈ G, w ∈ WG (σ), using Corollary 4.7, R(w −1 P w : P : σ)f (x) =
R0 (w −1P w : P : σ)φ′ (1) where φ′ is the restriction to G0 of l(x−1 )f . Now since
f = Φ(φ) is supported on G0 , φ′ = 0 unless x ∈ G0 . If x0 ∈ G0 , then R(w −1P w : P :
σ)f (x0 ) = R0 (w −1 P w : P : σ)φ(x0 ).
  Now by definition, R(w, σ)f (x0 n−1  w1 ) =
                                                 1

                                           0
By the above this is zero unless n−1
                                  w1 nw ∈ G , that is unless w = w1 w0 , w0 ∈ WG0 (σ).
In this case, using Lemma 4.12,
              R(w1 w0 , σ)f (x0 n−1                                         −1

                                                         1
        = η(w1, w0 )σw1 (nw1 )αw−1P w1 (nw1 ) 2 R0 (w1 P w1−1 : P : σ)R0 (w0 : σ)φ(x0 ).
                                     1




  Recall that if we write WG0 0 (σ) for the subgroup of elements w ∈ WG0 (σ) such that
R0 (w, σ) is scalar, then WG0 0 (σ) = W (Φ1 ) is generated by reflections in a set Φ1 of
reduced roots of (G, A). Let Φ+ be the positive system of reduced roots of (G, A)
determined by P and let Φ+               +
                            1 = Φ1 ∩ Φ . If we define

                     Rσ0 = {w ∈ WG0 (σ) : wβ ∈ Φ+ for all β ∈ Φ+
                                                               1 },

then WG0 (σ) is the semidirect product of Rσ0 and W (Φ1 ). Rσ0 is called the R-group
for IP0 (σ) and the operators
                                 {R0 (r, σ), r ∈ Rσ0 }
30                     DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

form a basis for the algebra of intertwining operators of IP0 (σ). We will define
                    Rσ = {w ∈ WG (σ) : wβ ∈ Φ+ for all β ∈ Φ+
                                                            1 }.

Clearly Rσ ∩ G0 = Rσ0 .
Lemma 4.14. R(w, σ) is scalar if w ∈ W (Φ1 ), and WG (σ) is the semidirect product
of W (Φ1 ) and Rσ .

Proof: Fix w ∈ W (Φ1 ), nw ∈ K a representative for w, and f ∈ HP (σ). Then for all
x ∈ G,
R(w, σ)f (x) = σw (nw )R(w −1 P w : P : σ)f (xnw ) = σw (nw )R0 (w −1 P w : P : σ)φ(nw ) =
where φ(x0 ) = f (xx0 ) for all x0 ∈ G0 . Thus
                             R(w, σ)f (x) = R0 (w, σ)φ(1).
But since w ∈ W (Φ1 ) there is a constant cw such that R0 (w, σ)φ = cw φ for all
φ ∈ HP0 (σ). Thus
                        R(w, σ)f (x) = cw φ(1) = cw f (x)
so R(w, σ) is scalar.
  We must show that for any w ∈ WG (σ), wΦ1 = Φ1 so that
                           Rσ = {w ∈ WG (σ) : wΦ+    +
                                                1 = Φ1 }.

Then as in the connected case it will be clear that WG (σ) is the semidirect product
of Rσ and W (Φ1 ). Let w ∈ WG (σ), α ∈ Φ1 , and let sα ∈ W (Φ1 ) denote the reflection
corresponding to α. Then wsαw −1 = swα ∈ WG0 (σ). But R(sα : σ) is scalar so that
using Lemma 4.12, so is R(swα , σ) = R(wsα w −1 : σ). This implies as above that
R0 (swα, σ) is scalar. Hence swα ∈ W (Φ1 ) and wα ∈ Φ1 .

Lemma 4.15. The dimension of C(σ) is equal to [Rσ ].

Proof: By Lemma 4.4,
           dim C(σ) = [NG (σ)/NG0 (σ)] dim C 0 (σ) = [WG (σ)/WG0 (σ)][Rσ0 ]

           = [WG (σ)/WG0 (σ)][WG0 (σ)/W (Φ1 )] = [WG (σ)/W (Φ1 )] = [Rσ ].



Theorem 4.16. The operators {R(r, σ), r ∈ Rσ } form a basis for the algebra of
intertwining operators of IP (σ).

Proof: By Lemma 4.15 it suffices to show that the operators are linearly independent.
Suppose that cw , w ∈ Rσ , are constants so that
                                            X
                                                   cw R(w, σ)f (x) = 0
                                           w∈Rσ

for all f ∈ HP (σ), x ∈ G. Fix w1 ∈ Rσ . Then for all f = Φ(φ) with φ ∈ HP0 (σ) and
all x0 ∈ G0 , we have

                                                  w1 ) = 0.
                                        w∈Rσ

Now by Lemma 4.13, R(w, σ)f (x0 n−1
                                 w1 ) = 0 unless w = w1 w0 where w0 ∈ WG0 (σ) ∩
      0
Rσ = Rσ . Now again using Lemma 4.13,
                                                   cw1 w0 R(w1 w0 , σ)f (x0 n−1

                                         w0 ∈R0σ

                                                                1
                cw1 w0 η(w1 , w0 )σw1 (nw1 )αw−1 P w1 (nw1 ) 2 R0 (w1−1P w1 : P : σ)R0 (w0 : σ)φ(x0 )

                                                   1
      w0 ∈R0σ
                                  1
 = σw1 (nw1 )αw−1 P w1 (nw1 ) 2 R0 (w1−1 P w1 : P : σ)                        cw1 w0 η(w1 , w0 )R0 (w0 : σ)φ(x0 ).
                                                                     X
                     1
                                                                    w0 ∈R0σ

Thus
                                        cw1 w0 η(w1, w0 )R0 (w0 : σ)φ(x0 ) = 0
                               X

                              w0 ∈R0σ

for all φ ∈ HP0 (σ) and all x0 ∈ G0 . Now since we know that the operators R0 (w0 : σ)
are linearly independent on HP0 (σ), we can conclude that the cw1 w0 η(w1 , w0 ) and hence
the cw1 w0 are all zero.
  As in Arthur [2] we now have to deal with the cocycle η of Lemma 4.12. Fix a finite
central extension
                             1 → Zσ → R̃σ → Rσ → 1
over which η splits. Also define the functions ξσ : R̃σ → C∗ and the character χσ of
Zσ as in Arthur [2]. Then we obtain a homomorphism
                                   R̃(r, σ) = ξσ−1 (r)R(r, σ), r ∈ R̃σ ,
of R̃σ into the group of unitary intertwining operators for IP (σ) which transforms by
                             R̃(zr, σ) = χσ (z)−1 R̃(r, σ), z ∈ Zσ , r ∈ R̃σ .
  Now we can define a representation R of R̃σ × G on HP (σ) given by
                              R(r, x) = R̃(r, σ)IP (σ, x), r ∈ R̃σ , x ∈ G.
Let Π(R̃σ , χσ ) denote the set of irreducible representations of R̃σ with Zσ central
character χσ and let Πσ (G) denote the set of irreducible constituents of IP (σ).

Theorem 4.17. There is a bijection ρ 7→ πρ of Π(R̃σ , χσ ) onto Πσ (G) such that
                             R = ⊕ρ∈Π(R̃σ ,χσ )          (ρ∨ ⊗ πρ ).

Proof: Write the decomposition of R into irreducibles as
                                              mρ,π (ρ∨ ⊗ π)
                                      X
                                 R=
                                       ρ,π

where ρ runs over Π(R̃σ , χσ ), π runs over Πσ (G), and each mρ,π ≥ 0. This corresponds
to a decomposition
                               HP (σ) ≃ (Vρ∨ ⊗ Wπ )mρ,π
                                         X

                                         ρ,π
where V and Wπ denote the representation spaces for the irreducible representations
        ρ∨
ρ∨ and π. For each ρ, we also write
                                                         Wπmρ,π
                                                  X
                                 Hρ ≃ Vρ∨ ⊗
                                                     π

for the ρ-isotypic component of HP (σ). Each subspace Hρ is invariant under the action
of R, in particular by all of the intertwining operators R̃(r, σ), r ∈ R̃σ . Since these
intertwining operators span the space C(σ) of G-intertwining operators for HP (σ),
each T ∈ C(σ) must satisfy T (Hρ ) ⊂ Hρ for every ρ.
   We will first show that given π, there is at most one ρ such that mρ,π > 0. So fix π
and suppose that there are ρ1 and ρ2 such that mρi ,π > 0, i = 1, 2. Then Wπ occurs
as a G-summand of both Hρ1 and Hρ2 . Thus there is T12 6= 0 in HomG (Hρ1 , Hρ2 ).
We can extend T12 to an element T of C(σ) by setting T = T12 on Hρ1 and T = 0 on
Hρ , ρ 6= ρ1 . Thus there is T in C(σ) such that T (Hρ1 ) ⊂ Hρ2 . But by the remark in
the previous paragraph, T (Hρ1 ) ⊂ Hρ1 . Now since T (Hρ1 ) 6= 0, we must have ρ1 ≃ ρ2 .
   Now fix ρ and look at Hρ ≃ Vρ∨ ⊗ W where W = π Wπmρ,π . We will show that
                                                         P

W is irreducible as a G-module. Thus suppose that W = W1 ⊕ W2 where W1 , W2 are
G-submodules of W . Then we can define T ∈ C(σ) by T (v ⊗ (w1 + w2 )) = v ⊗ w1 if
v ∈ Vρ∨ , w1 ∈ W1 , w2 ∈ W2 , and T = 0 on Hρ′ if ρ′ 6≃ ρ. Now since T ∈ C(σ), we can
write T = r cr R̃(r, σ) where r runs over R̃σ . Thus for all v ∈ Vρ∨ , w1 ∈ W1 , w2 ∈ W2 ,
             P

we have
                                               cr ρ∨ (r)v) ⊗ w1 + (        cr ρ∨ (r)v) ⊗ w2 .
                                         X                             X
       v ⊗ w1 = T (v ⊗ (w1 + w2 )) = (
                                          r                            r
                                                 ∨
Suppose W2 6= 0. This implies that r cr ρ (r)v = 0 for all v so that v ⊗ w1 = 0 for
                                      P

all w1 . Thus W1 = {0} and hence W is irreducible. But this implies that mρ,π ≤ 1
for all π and that there is at most one π such that mρ,π = 1.
   Define
                     Π1 = {ρ ∈ Π(R̃σ , χσ ) : mρ,π = 1 for some π}.
For each ρ ∈ Π1 we have shown that the representation π such that mρ,π = 1 is unique.
Thus we will call it πρ . Further, we have shown that πρ1 ≃ πρ2 just in case ρ1 ≃ ρ2 .
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 33

Further, by definition of Πσ (G), each π ∈ Πσ (G) occurs in HP (σ) and so must be of
the form πρ for some ρ ∈ Π1 . Thus to complete the proof of the theorem we need only
show that Π1 = Π(R̃σ , χσ ).
  Since                                 X
                              HP (σ) ≃     (Vρ∨ ⊗ Wπρ ),
                                           ρ∈Π1
                                            2
we must have dim C(σ) =       ρ∈Π1 (deg   ρ) . But since the R(r, σ), r ∈ Rσ , form a basis
                            P

for C(σ), we know that
                                                              (deg ρ)2 .
                                                      X
                          dim C(σ) = [Rσ ] =
                                                  ρ∈Π(R̃σ ,χσ )

Thus Π1 = Π(R̃σ , χσ ).

Remark 4.18 Suppose now that G/G0 is cyclic. Then in [1], Arthur predicts a dual
group construction of a group Rψ,σ , in terms of the conjectural parameter ψ for the
L–packet of σ, which should also describe the components of IndG  P (σ). In particular,
                  0
Rψ,σ = Wψ,σ /Wψ,σ , where these groups are defined in terms of centralizers of the
                                                                 0
image of ψ. Furthermore, Arthur has conjecturally identified Wψ,σ    with W (Φ1 ) and
Wψ,σ with WG (σ). Thus, if the conjectural parameterization exists in the connected
case, and Shelstad’s Theorem [12] extends to the p-adic case, then it must be the
case that Rσ ≃ Rψ,σ . That is, we have shown that there is a group side construction
of Arthur’s R–group, if such an object exists. (For more details see [1] and [6],
particularly Sections 1 and 4.)

                              5. R-groups for IndG
                                                 P (σ)

   In this section we will study representations of G which are induced from discrete
series representations of a parabolic subgroup P of G. Thus we revert to the notation
that parabolic subgroups of G0 are denoted by P 0 .
   Let P = MN be a cuspidal parabolic subgroup of G. Let σ be an irreducible
discrete series representation of M and let σ0 be an irreducible constituent of the
restriction of σ to M 0 . We want to find a basis for the intertwining algebra C(σ)
of the induced representation IndG                                        M
                                    P (σ). Since σ is contained in IndM 0 (σ0 ) we know
    G                        G     M              G
IndP (σ) is contained in IndP (IndM 0 (σ0 )) ≃ IndP 0 (σ0 ). In §4 we found a basis for the
intertwining algebra C(σ0 ) of IndGP 0 (σ0 ). We will see how to obtain a basis for C(σ)
by restricting the intertwining operators defined in §4.
   We first need to embed σ in a family σν , ν ∈ a∗C , where a is the real Lie algebra of
the split component A of M. Write X(M), X(A) for the groups of rational characters
of M, A respectively. Let
                             r : X(M) ⊗Z R → X(A) ⊗Z R
be the map given by restriction. That is r(χ ⊗ t) = χ|A ⊗ t for χ ∈ X(M), t ∈ R.
34                     DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

Lemma 5.1. The homomorphism r : X(M) ⊗Z R → X(A) ⊗Z R is surjective.

Proof: Since G is a linear group we have an embedding of G in L = GL(V ), where V
is a finite dimensional F –vector space. Since A is a split torus, the action of A on V
can be diagonalized. For any χ ∈ X(A) let V (χ) = {v ∈ V : av = χ(a)v for all a ∈ A}.
Let χi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k, denote the distinct elements of X(A) such that Vi = V (χi ) 6= {0}.
We can identify a ∈ A with the block diagonal matrix with diagonal entries χi (a)Idi
where di = dim Vi and Idi denotes the identity matrix of size di , 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
   Since M = CG (A), we have M ⊂ CL (A) ≃ GL(V1 ) × GL(V2 ) × ... × GL(Vk ). For
each 1 ≤ i ≤ k we can define deti ∈ X(M) by deti (m1 , ..., mk ) = det mi . Now
deti ⊗d−1i  ∈ X(M) ⊗Z R and for a ∈ A, deti ⊗d−1                    di  −1
                                                      i (a) = χi (a) ⊗ di   = χi (a) ⊗ 1.
Thus r(deti ⊗d−1i ) = χ i ⊗ 1. The χi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are generators of X(A), although  they
need not be independent. Thus r is surjective.
     Let X0 (M) = {χ ∈ X(M) : χ|M 0 = 1}.
Lemma 5.2. The kernel of r is X0 (M) ⊗Z R.

Proof: Suppose χ ⊗ t is in the kernel of r where χ ∈ X(M) and t ∈ R. If t = 0 then
χ ⊗ t is the identity element. Assume t 6= 0. Then |χ(a)|tF = 1 for all a ∈ A implies
that |χ(a)|F = 1 for all a ∈ A. Since χ|A is a rational character of a split torus this
implies that χ|A = 1. But restriction from X(M 0 ) to X(A) is injective [13, Lemma
0.4.1], so that χ|M 0 = 1. Thus χ ∈ X0 (M).
     Recall the homomorphism HM 0 : M 0 → Hom(X(M 0 ), Z) defined by
                 < HM 0 (m), χ >= logq |χ(m)|F , m ∈ M 0 , χ ∈ X(M 0 ).
Define an analogous homomorphism HM : M → Hom(X(M), Z) by
                   < HM (m), χ >= logq |χ(m)|F , m ∈ M, χ ∈ X(M).
Lemma 5.3. Suppose that χ ∈ X0 (M). Then < HM (m), χ >= 0 for all m ∈ M.
     .
Proof: Let χ ∈ X0 (M). Thus χ(m0 ) = 1 for all m0 ∈ M 0 . Let d be the index of M 0 in
M. Thus md ∈ M 0 for all m ∈ M so that χ(md ) = 1 for all m ∈ M. Thus χ(m) is a dth
root of unity and |χ(m)|F = 1 for all m ∈ M. Thus < HM (m), χ >= logq |χ(m)|F = 0
for all m ∈ M.
   Recall that Hom(X(M 0 ), Z)⊗Z R ≃ Hom(X(A), Z)⊗Z R = a is the real Lie algebra
of A, a∗ = X(A) ⊗Z R is its real dual, and a∗C = a∗ ⊗R C is its complex dual. For
each ν ∈ a∗C we have a character χ0ν of M 0 defined by χ0ν (m) = q <HM 0 (m),ν> , m ∈ M 0 .
By Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 the mapping r above induces an isomomorphism
                               X(M) ⊗Z C
                        r∗ :               ≃ X(A) ⊗Z C ≃ a∗C .

   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 35

By Lemma 5.3, for each m ∈ M, HM (m) is an element of the complex dual of
X(M )⊗Z C
X0 (M )⊗Z C
            . Thus for each ν ∈ a∗C , we can define a character χν of M by
                                                −1
                            χν (m) = q <HM (m),r∗    (ν)>
                                                            , m ∈ M.
Lemma 5.4. For all ν ∈ a∗C , the restriction of χν to M 0 is χ0ν .

Proof: For m0 ∈ M 0 , χ ∈ X(M) we have
          < HM (m0 ), χ >= logq |χ(m0 )|F = logq |χ0 (m0 )|F =< HM0 (m0 ), χ0 >
where χ0 denotes the restriction of χ to M 0 . Since the isomorphism r∗ comes from
the restriction map it is easy to see that < HM (m0 ), r∗−1(ν) >=< HM 0 (m0 ), ν > for
all m0 ∈ M 0 , ν ∈ a∗C .
  As above, let σ be an irreducible discrete series representation of M and let σ0 be
an irreducible constituent of the restriction of σ to M 0 . Let V0 be the representation
space for σ0 and let
       W = {f : M → V0 : f (mm0 ) = σ0 (m0 )−1 f (m) for all m ∈ M, m0 ∈ M 0 }.
Then M acts on W by left translation and we will call this induced representation
(IM , W ). Let V denote the representation space for σ and fix a non-zero intertwining
operator S : V → W so that Sσ(m) = IM (m)S for all m ∈ M. Since IM is unitary,
we can also define a projection operator P : W → V so that P IM (m) = σ(m)P for
all m ∈ M and P Sv = v for all v ∈ V . We also define representation spaces
                                        −1
HP (σ) = {φ ∈ C ∞ (G, V ) : φ(xmn) = δP 2 (m)σ(m)−1 φ(x) for all x ∈ G, m ∈ M, n ∈ N};
HP 0 (σ0 ) =
                                  −1
{ψ ∈ C ∞ (G, V0 ) : ψ(xm0 n) = δP 02 (m0 )σ0 (m0 )−1 ψ(x) for all x ∈ G, m0 ∈ M 0 , n ∈ N};
HP (IM ) =
                                   −1
  {ψ ∈ C ∞ (G, W ) : ψ(xmn) = δP 2 (m)IM (m)−1 ψ(x) for all x ∈ G, m ∈ M, n ∈ N}.
In each case G acts on the representation space by left translations and we call the
induced representations IP (σ), IP 0 (σ0 ), and IP (IM ) respectively. They are the repre-
sentations IndG           G                 G     M
                P (σ), IndP 0 (σ0 ), and IndP (IndM 0 (σ0 )) respectively.
  The intertwining operators S : V → W and P : W → V induce intertwining
operators S ∗ from (IP (σ), HP (σ)) to (IP (IM ), HP (IM )) and P ∗ from (IP (IM ), HP (IM ))
to (IP (σ), HP (σ)) given by
                      (S ∗ φ)(x) = Sφ(x) for all φ ∈ HP (σ), x ∈ G;
                     (P ∗ ψ)(x) = P ψ(x) for all ψ ∈ HP (IM ), x ∈ G.
36                        DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

There is also an equivalence T between (IP (IM ), HP (IM )) and (IP 0 (σ0 ), HP 0 (σ0 )) given
by
                     (T ψ)(x) = ψ(x)(1) for all ψ ∈ HP (IM ), x ∈ G.
Its inverse is given by
                                1
          (T −1 ψ ′ )(x)(m) = δP2 (m)ψ ′ (xm) for all ψ ′ ∈ HP 0 (σ0 ), x ∈ G, m ∈ M.
   Recall for each ν ∈ a∗C we have defined characters χ0ν of M 0 and χν of M such that
χ0ν is the restriction of χν to M 0 . We use these characters to define representations
σ(ν) = σ ⊗ χν and IM (ν) = IM ⊗ χν of M and σ0 (ν) = σ0 ⊗ χ0 (ν) of M 0 . As above we
use these to form induced representation spaces HP (σ, ν) = HP (σ(ν)), HP (IM , ν) =
HP (IM (ν)), and HP 0 (σ, ν) = HP 0 (σ0 (ν)). The intertwining operators S : V → W
and P : W → V also intertwine σ(ν) and IM (ν) and so as above define induced
intertwining operators Sν∗ : HP (σ, ν) → HP (IM , ν) and Pν∗ : HP (IM , ν) → HP (σ, ν).
There are also equivalences Tν : HP (IM , ν) → HP 0 (σ0 , ν) given by
                     (Tν ψ)(x) = ψ(x)(1) for all ψ ∈ HP (IM , ν), x ∈ G.
The inverses are given by

      (Tν−1 ψ ′ )(x)(m) = δP2 (m)χν (m)ψ ′ (xm) for all ψ ′ ∈ HP 0 (σ0 , ν), x ∈ G, m ∈ M.
  Suppose P1 = MN1 and P2 = MN2 are two cuspidal parabolic subgroups of G with
Levi component M. In §4 we defined a meromorphic family of intertwining operators
                       J(P20 : P10 : σ0 : ν) : HP10 (σ0 , ν) → HP20 (σ0 , ν).
We can transfer these intertwining operators to the equivalent spaces HPi (IM , ν), i =
1, 2, by means of the equivalences Tν,Pi . Thus we define
                       J(P2 : P1 : IM : ν) : HP1 (IM , ν) → HP2 (IM , ν)

We can also define
                          J(P2 : P1 : σ : ν) : HP1 (σ, ν) → HP2 (σ, ν)

Lemma 5.5. Suppose that ν ∈ a∗C (P20 : P10 ) so that J(P20 : P10 : σ0 : ν) is given by
the convergent integral

For m ∈ M 0 we know that

        −1     1
Since βδP12 δP22 is a homomorphism from the finite group M/M 0 into R+ , it must be
identically one. Hence for all m ∈ M we have

Thus                                                                         Z

  Let r(P20 : P10 : σ0 : ν) be the scalar normalizing factors used in §4 to define the
normalized intertwining operators
                R(P20 : P10 : σ0 ) = r(P20 : P10 : σ0 : 0)−1 J(P20 : P10 : σ0 : 0).
The fact that
                           r(P20 : P10 : σ0 : ν)−1 J(P20 : P10 : σ0 : ν)
is holomorphic and non-zero at ν = 0 and that Tν,Pi , i = 1, 2, are equivalences, will
imply that
                      r(P20 : P10 : σ0 : ν)−1 J(P2 : P1 : IM : ν)
is also holomorphic and non-zero at ν = 0. Thus we can define
                R(P2 : P1 : IM ) = r(P20 : P10 : σ0 : 0)−1 J(P2 : P1 : IM : 0).
We also define
     R(P2 : P1 : σ) = r(P20 : P10 : σ0 : 0)−1 J(P2 : P1 : σ : 0) = P ∗ R(P2 : P1 : IM )S ∗ .
Lemma 5.6. Let φ ∈ HP1 (σ). Then R(P2 : P1 : IM )S ∗ φ(x) ∈ S(V ) for all x ∈ G.

Proof: For every ν we have an intertwining operator J(P2 : P1 : IM : ν)Sν∗ :
HP1 (σ, ν) → HP2 (IM : ν). In order to carry out arguments using the integral for-
mula and meromorphic extension of the intertwining operator we want a compact
realization of the representation. Since we do not know if there is a maximal compact
subgroup of G which meets every connected component, we proceed one coset at a
time. Let GM = G0 M and write G = ∪ki=1 xi GM . Then P ⊂ GM for any parabolic
subgroup P of G with Levi component M. Let K 0 be a good maximal compact
subgroup of G0 so that G0 = K 0 P 0 . Thus GM = K 0 P . Let HK 0 (σ) =
{fK ∈ C ∞ (K 0 , V ) : fK (kmn) = σ −1 (m)fK (k) for all m ∈ K 0 ∩M, n ∈ K 0 ∩N, k ∈ K 0 }.
For any φ ∈ HP (σ : ν) and 1 ≤ i ≤ k we can define
                                              φ(x), if x ∈ xi GM ;
                                          
                               φi (x) =
                                              0,    otherwise.
Then φi ∈ HP (σ : ν) for each i and φ = ki=1 φi . Thus every element of HP (σ : ν)
                                                  P

is a sum of elements supported on a single coset of GM in G and so it is enough to
prove the lemma for φ ∈ HP1 (σ) supported on a single coset of GM in G.
   Fix 1 ≤ i ≤ k and define
                                Fi (ν) : HP1 (σ : ν) → HK 0 (σ)
by Fi (ν)φ(k) = φ(xi k) for all k ∈ K 0 . Define

                                                                           0

                         0,                            otherwise.
Then Fi (ν)Fi−1 (ν)fK = fK for all fK ∈ HK 0 (σ) and Fi−1 (ν)Fi (ν)φ = φi for all
φ ∈ HP1 (σ : ν).
   Fix 1 ≤ i ≤ k and φ ∈ HP1 (σ) = HP1 (σ : 0) such that φ = φi is supported on
xi GM . Let fK = Fi (0)φ ∈ HK 0 (σ) and for each ν define φi (ν) ∈ HP1 (σ : ν) by
φi (ν : x) = Fi−1 (ν)fK (x), x ∈ G. We have φi (0) = Fi−1 (0)Fi (0)φ = φi = φ.
   Fix w ∗ ∈ S(V )⊥ and define Φ(ν : x) =< J(P2 : P1 : IM : ν)Sν∗ φi (ν : x), w ∗ >. Then
ν 7→ Φ(ν : x) is a meromorphic function of ν ∈ a∗C for each x ∈ G. If ν ∈ a∗C (P20 : P10 ),
by Lemma 5.5 we have
                                                    Z
             J(P2 : P1 : IM : ν)Sν∗ φi (ν : x) =                Sφi (ν : xn)dn ∈ S(V ).
                                                      N 1 ∩N2

Thus Φ(x : ν) = 0 for all ν ∈ a∗C (P20 : P10) and hence for all ν. Thus
                               J(P2 : P1 : IM : ν)Sν∗ φi (ν : x) ∈ S(V )
for all ν and so
                 r(P20 : P10 : σ0 : ν)−1 J(P2 : P1 : IM : ν)Sν∗ φi (ν : x) ∈ S(V )
for all ν ∈ a∗C , x ∈ G. In particular for ν = 0 we have R(P2 : P1 : IM )S ∗ φ(x) ∈ S(V )
for all x ∈ G.

Corollary 5.7. Let φ ∈ HP1 (σ). Then R(P2 : P1 : IM )S ∗ φ = S ∗ R(P2 : P1 : σ)φ.

Proof: This follows from Lemma 5.6 since SP is the identity on S(V ).

Lemma 5.8. Suppose P1 , P2 , and P3 are cuspidal parabolic subgroups of G with Levi
component M. Then
                         R(P1 : P3 : IM ) = R(P1 : P2 : IM )R(P2 : P3 : IM )
and
                           R(P1 : P3 : σ) = R(P1 : P2 : σ)R(P2 : P3 : σ).

Proof: The statement for IM follows easily from Lemma 4.8 since the intertwining
operators Tν are equivalences. Now using Corollary 5.7 we have
      R(P1 : P3 : σ) = P ∗ R(P1 : P3 : IM )S ∗ = P ∗ R(P1 : P2 : IM )R(P2 : P3 : IM )S ∗
           P ∗ R(P1 : P2 : IM )S ∗ R(P2 : P3 : σ) = R(P1 : P2 : σ)R(P2 : P3 : σ).


Lemma 5.9. Suppose P1 and P2 are parabolic subgroups of G with Levi component
M. Then R(P2 : P1 : σ) is an equivalence from HP1 (σ) onto HP2 (σ).

                                                     w mnw ), m ∈ M.

It is easy to check that
                        T (nw )IM (m) = IM (nw mn−1
                                                 w )T (nw ), m ∈ M.

Next we define intertwining operators BP (w) : Hw−1 P w (IM ) → HP (IM ) by
                                                     1
                      BP (w)ψ(g) = αw−1 P w (nw ) 2 T (nw )ψ(gnw ), g ∈ G.
Finally we define self-intertwining operators R(w, IM ) : HP (IM ) → HP (IM ) by
                           R(w, IM ) = BP (w)R(w −1P w : P : IM ).
Recall that in §4 we defined intertwining operators
          AP (w) : Hw−1 P 0 w (σ0 ) → HP 0 (σ0 ) and R(w, σ0 ) : HP 0 (σ0 ) → HP 0 (σ0 ).
It is easy to check that
               BP (w) = TP−1 AP (w)Tw−1 P w and R(w, IM ) = TP−1 R(w, σ0 )TP
where TP : HP (IM ) → HP 0 (σ0 ) is the equivalence defined above. In particular this
implies that BP (w) and R(w, IM ) are independent of the coset representatives chosen.
  Define NG (σ) = {g ∈ NG (M) : σ g ≃ σ}. If w ∈ WG (σ) = NG (σ)/M, σ can be
extended to a representation of the group Mw generated by M and any representative
nw for w. Denote such an extension by σw and define A′P (w) : Hw−1 P w (σ) → HP (σ)
by
                                                            1
                     (A′P (w)φ)(x) = σw (nw )αw−1 P w (nw ) 2 φ(xnw ).
Lemma 5.10. The intertwining operator A′P (w) is independent of the choice of coset
representative nw for w ∈ WG (σ). For w1 , w2 ∈ WG (σ) there is a non-zero constant
cP (w1 , w2 ) so that
                       A′P (w1 , w2 ) = cP (w1 , w2 )A′P (w1 )A′w−1 P w1 (w2 ).
                                                                  1


Proof: The proof is exactly the same as that of Lemma 4.11.
     Finally, for w ∈ WG (σ), we define R(w, σ) : HP (σ) → HP (σ) by
                            R(w, σ) = A′P (w)R(w −1P w : P : σ).
Note that for u ∈ WG (σ0 ) we could also have defined an intertwining operator
                                  R′ (u, σ) : HP (σ) → HP (σ)
by
                                   R′ (u, σ) = P ∗ R(u, IM )S ∗ .
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 41

  We want to relate these two definitions. Let
                    WG (σ0 , σ) = [NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ)]/M 0 ⊂ WG (σ0 ).
Suppose that x ∈ NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ). Then x represents an element xM 0 ∈ WG (σ0 , σ)
and an element xM ∈ WG (σ). Let
                                 p : WG (σ0 , σ) → WG (σ)
be given by p(xM 0 ) = xM, x ∈ NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ).
Lemma 5.11. The mapping p is surjective. Its kernel is WM (σ0 ) = NM (σ0 )/M 0 .

Proof: Let w ∈ WG (σ) and let x ∈ NG (σ) be a representative for w. Then σ0x
is contained in the restriction of σ x ≃ σ to M 0 so that there is m ∈ M such that
σ0x ≃ σ0m . Hence w has a representative xm−1 ∈ NG (σ) ∩ NG (σ0 ). Thus p is surjective.
Clearly p(xM 0 ) = M just in case x ∈ NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ) ∩ M = NM (σ0 ).

Lemma 5.12. Suppose that u ∈ WG (σ0 ) is in the complement of WG (σ0 , σ). Then
                                        R′ (u, σ) = 0.
If u ∈ WG (σ0 , σ), then there is a complex constant c so that
                                 R′ (u, σ) = cR(p(u), σ).

Proof: Using Corollary 5.7, for any u ∈ WG (σ0 ),
              R′ (u, σ) = P ∗ R(u, IM )S ∗ = P ∗ BP (u)R(u−1P u : P : IM )S ∗
                         = P ∗ BP (u)S ∗R(u−1 P u : P : σ).
But for any g ∈ G, φ ∈ Hu−1 P u (σ), if x ∈ NG (σ0 ) is a representative for u,
                                                     1
                    P ∗ BP (u)S ∗φ(g) = αu−1 P u (x) 2 (P T (x)S)φ(gx).
                                   x
Since T (x) intertwines IM and IM    , we see that P T (x)S intertwines σ and σ x ≃ σ u .
Thus P T (x)S = 0 and hence R′ (u, σ) = 0 unless σ u ≃ σ.
  Suppose u ∈ WG (σ0 , σ). Write u = ux , w = wx = p(u), x ∈ NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ). Then
P T (x)S and σw (x) both intertwine σ and σ x , and σw (x) 6= 0. Thus there is a complex
constant c′ so that P T (x)S = c′ σw (x). Thus for any g ∈ G,
                                         1
             R′ (u, σ)φ(g) = αu−1 P u (x) 2 (P T (x)S)[R(u−1P u : P : σ)φ](gx)
                                    1
                     = c′ αu−1 P u (x) 2 σw (x)[R(u−1 P u : P : σ)φ](gx)
                  = c′ A′P (w)R(w −1P w : P : σ)φ(g) = c′ R(w, σ)φ(g).


Lemma 5.13. The R(w, σ), w ∈ WG (σ), span the algebra C(σ) of self-intertwining
operators on HP (σ).
42                      DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

Proof: Let R be a self-intertwining operator for HP (σ). Then S ∗ RP ∗ is a self-
intertwining operator for HP (IM ), hence in the span of the R(u, IM ), u ∈ WG (σ0 ). But
then R = P ∗ S ∗ RP ∗ S ∗ is in the span of the P ∗ R(u, IM )S ∗ = R′ (u, σ), u ∈ WG (σ0 ).
But by Lemma 5.12, each R′ (u, σ) is either zero or a multiple of one of the operators
R(w, σ), w ∈ WG (σ).
Lemma 5.14. Let u ∈ WG (σ0 ) and suppose that R(u, IM ) is scalar. Then u ∈
WG (σ0 , σ) and R(p(u), σ) is scalar.

Proof: Suppose that there is a constant s ∈ C such R(u, IM )ψ = sψ for all ψ ∈
HP (IM ). Since R(u, IM ) 6= 0, s 6= 0. Now for all φ ∈ HP (σ),
                      R′ (u, σ)φ = P ∗ R(u, IM )S ∗ φ = sP ∗ S ∗ φ = sφ.
Thus R′ (u, σ) is scalar and non-zero. Thus by Lemma 5.12 we have u ∈ WG (σ0 , σ).
Further, by Lemma 5.12, there is a constant c so that R′ (u, σ) = cR(p(u), σ). Since
R′ (u, σ) 6= 0, c 6= 0. Thus R(p(u), σ) = c−1 R′ (u, σ) is scalar.
Lemma 5.15. There is a cocycle η so that
                        R(w1 w2 , σ) = η(w1 , w2 )R(w1 , σ)R(w2 , σ)
for all w1 , w2 ∈ WG (σ).
Proof: The proof is similar to Lemma 4.12.
   As in §4, if WG0 0 (σ0 ) is the subgroup of elements u ∈ WG0 (σ0 ) such that R0 (u, σ0 ) is
scalar, then WG0 0 (σ0 ) = W (Φ1 ) is generated by reflections in a set Φ1 of reduced roots
of (G, A). Let Φ+ , Φ+  1 be defined as in §4. Since M centralizes A, WG (σ) ⊂ NG (A)/M
acts on roots of A and we can define
                     Rσ = {w ∈ WG (σ) : wβ ∈ Φ+ for all β ∈ Φ+
                                                             1 }.

We want to prove the following.
Theorem 5.16. The R(w, σ), w ∈ Rσ , form a basis for the algebra of intertwining
operators of IP (σ).
   In order to prove Theorem 5.16, we will first compute the dimension of C(σ) using
our knowledge of the dimension of C(σ0 ). We denote the equivalence classes of IndG  P (σ)
        G
and IndP 0 (σ0 ) by iG,M (σ) and iG,M 0 (σ0 ) respectively. Let X and Y denote the groups
of unitary characters of G/G0 and M/M 0 respectively. For χ ∈ X, let χM ∈ Y denote
the restriction of χ to M. Define
                             X(σ) = {χ ∈ X : χM ⊗ σ ≃ σ};
                    X1 (σ) = {χ ∈ X : χ ⊗ iG,M (σ) ≃ iG,M (σ)};
                            Y (σ) = {η ∈ Y : σ ⊗ η ≃ σ}.
Let s denote the multiplicity of σ0 in the restriction of σ to M 0 .
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 43

Lemma 5.17.
                    dim C(σ0 ) = dim C(σ)s2 [X/X(σ)][X1 (σ)/X(σ)].

Proof: Using Lemma 2.13,
                                                     X
                               iM,M 0 (σ0 ) = s                σ ⊗ η.
                                                  η∈Y /Y (σ)

This implies that                                    X
                        iG,M (iM,M 0 (σ0 )) = s                iG,M (σ ⊗ η).
                                                  η∈Y /Y (σ)

Since both G/G0 and M/M 0 are finite abelian, it is clear that the map χ 7→ χM
induces an isomorphism between X/X(σ) and Y /Y (σ). Thus we can rewrite
                                                   X
                       iG,M (iM,M 0 (σ0 )) = s              iG,M (σ ⊗ χM ).
                                                 χ∈X/X(σ)

But by Corollary 3.3 the induced representations iG,M (σ ⊗ χM ) are either disjoint or
equal. Further,
                        iG,M (σ ⊗ χM ) = iG,M (σ) ⊗ χ = iG,M (σ)
just in case χ ∈ X1 (σ). Thus we have
                                                                X
                iG,M (iM,M 0 (σ0 )) = s[X1 (σ)/X(σ)]                    iG,M (σ) ⊗ χ
                                                          χ∈X/X1 (σ)

where the representations iG,M (σ) ⊗ χ are disjoint for χ ∈ X/X1 (σ). Thus
                    dim C(σ0 ) = dim C(σ)s2 [X1 (σ)/X(σ)]2 [X/X1(σ)]
                          = dim C(σ)s2 [X/X(σ)][X1 (σ)/X(σ)].


Lemma 5.18.
                     s2 [X/X(σ)][X1 (σ)/X(σ)] = [WG (σ0 )]/[WG (σ)].

Proof: First, using Lemma 2.13 we have
                s2 [X/X(σ)] = s2 [Y /Y (σ)] = [NM (σ0 )/M 0 ] = [WM (σ0 )].
We claim that
                       [X1 (σ)/X(σ)] = [WG (σ0 )/WG (σ0 , σ)].
This would establish the lemma since by Lemma 5.11 we have
                             [WG (σ)] = [WG (σ0 , σ)/WM (σ0 )].
  We will define a bijection between X1 (σ)/X(σ) and
                    (NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ))\NG (σ0 ) ≃ WG (σ0 , σ)\WG (σ0 ).
44                       DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

Let χ ∈ X1 (σ). The equivalence class of σ ⊗ χM depends only on the coset χ of χ in
X1 (σ)/X(σ). Further, by definition of X1 (σ), we have
                                 iG,M (σ ⊗ χM ) = iG,M (σ).
By Corollary 3.2 there is x ∈ NG (A) such that σ ⊗ χM ≃ σ x . Thus σ|M 0 ≃ σ x |M 0 .
Thus σ0x occurs in σ|M 0 and so there is m ∈ M such that σ0x ≃ σ0m . Then y = xm−1 ∈
NG (σ0 ). Although y ∈ NG (σ0 ) is not uniquely determined by χ,
                                    σ ⊗ χM ≃ σ y1 ≃ σ y2
if and only if y1 y2−1 ∈ NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ). Thus for each χ ∈ X1 (σ)/X(σ) there is
a unique coset x(χ) = (NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ))x in (NG (σ0 ) ∩ NG (σ))\NG (σ0 ) such that
χM ⊗ σ ≃ σ x . Finally, given x ∈ NG (σ0 ), σ x is a constituent of iM,M 0 (σ0x ) ≃ iM,M 0 (σ0 )
so that there is η ∈ Y such that σ x ≃ σ ⊗ η. Now let χ ∈ X such that χM = η. Then
σ ⊗ χM ≃ σ x so that x = x(χ).
  Recall from §4 that WG (σ0 ) is the semidirect product of subgroups Rσ0 and W (Φ1 )
where R(w, σ0 ) is scalar for w ∈ W (Φ1 ) and the R(r, σ0 ), r ∈ Rσ0 , give a basis for
C(σ0 ).
Lemma 5.19.
                              dim C(σ) = [WG (σ)]/[W (Φ1 )].

Proof: Combining Lemmas 5.17 and 5.18 we have
                                             [WG (σ0 )]
                     dim C(σ0 ) = dim C(σ) ·            .
                                              [WG (σ)]
But from Lemma 4.15, dim C(σ0 ) = [Rσ0 ] = [WG (σ0 )]/[W (Φ1 )].
     Since W (Φ1 ) ⊂ NG0 (A)/M 0 , it can be naturally embedded in WG (A) = NG (A)/M.
Lemma 5.20. WG (σ) is the semidirect product of W (Φ1 ) and Rσ . For w ∈ WG (σ),
R(w, σ) is scalar if and only if w ∈ W (Φ1 ).

Proof: If x ∈ NG0 (σ0 ) represents an element of W (Φ1 ), then by Lemma 4.14
R(ux , IM ) is scalar. Thus by Lemma 5.14, wx ∈ WG (σ) and R(wx , σ) is scalar. Let
WG0 (σ) denote the set of all w ∈ WG (σ) such that R(w, σ) is scalar. By the above
W (Φ1 ) ⊂ WG0 (σ). Using Lemmas 5.13 and 5.19 we see that
                   [WG (σ)]/[W (Φ1 )] = dim C(σ) ≤ [WG (σ)]/[WG0 (σ)].
Thus W (Φ1 ) = WG0 (σ).
  Now as in the proof Lemma 4.14, W (Φ1 ) is a normal subgroup of WG (σ) and so
wΦ1 = Φ1 for all w ∈ WG (σ). This implies that
                             Rσ = {w ∈ WG (σ) : wΦ+    +
                                                  1 = Φ1 }

which yields the semidirect product decomposition.
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 45

Proof of Theorem 5.16. It follows from Lemmas 5.13,5.15, and 5.20 that the
R(w, σ),
w ∈ Rσ , span the algebra C(σ). Further, by Lemmas 5.19 and 5.20,
                        dim C(σ) = [WG (σ)]/W (Φ1 )] = [Rσ ].


  Let η be the cocycle of Lemma 5.15. Exactly as in §4 we can fix a finite central
extension
                               1 → Zσ → R̃σ → Rσ → 1
over which η splits, a character χσ of Zσ , and a representation R of R̃σ × G on HP (σ).
Let Π(R̃σ , χσ ) denote the set of irreducible representations of R̃σ with Zσ central
character χσ , and let Πσ (G) denote the set of irreducible constituents of IP (σ).
Theorem 5.21. There is a bijection ρ 7→ πρ of Π(R̃σ , χσ ) onto Πσ (G) such that
                             R = ⊕ρ∈Π(R̃σ ,χσ )   (ρ∨ ⊗ πρ ).

Proof: The proof is exactly the same as that of Theorem 4.17.

                                    6. Examples
For applications involving comparisons of representations between groups and twisted
trace formulas it is customary to use the following definition of parabolic subgroup.
Let P 0 be a parabolic subgroup of G0 . Then P = NG (P 0 ) is a parabolic subgroup of G.
Thus, using this definition, parabolic subgroups of G are in one to one correspondence
with parabolic subgroups of G0 . We will show that the parabolic subgroups obtained
using this definition are also parabolic subgroups using the definition of §2. However
they are not cuspidal in general. Indeed, recall from Proposition 2.10 that if P 0 is
a parabolic subgroup of G, then the corresponding cuspidal parabolic subgroup is
the smallest parabolic subgroup of G lying over P 0. On the other hand, if P is any
subgroup of G with P ∩ G0 = P 0 , then P ⊂ NG (P 0 ). Thus NG (P 0 ) will be the largest
parabolic subgroup of G lying over P 0 . We will give examples to show that this class
of parabolic subgroups, which we call N-parabolic subgroups (N for normalizer), do
not yield a nice theory of parabolically induced representations of G.
Lemma 6.1. Let P 0 be a parabolic subgroup of G0 . Then P = NG (P 0 ) is a parabolic
subgroup of G. It is the largest parabolic subgroup lying over P 0. If M 0 is a Levi
component for P 0 , then M = NG (M 0 ) ∩ P is a Levi component for P .

Proof: Let P 0 = M 0 N be a Levi decomposition of P 0 and define M = NG (M 0 ) ∩ P .
Then M ∩ G0 = M 0 and MN ⊂ P . Let x ∈ P = NG (P 0). Then xM 0 x−1 is a
Levi subgroup of P 0 and so there is n ∈ N such that xM 0 x−1 = nM 0 n−1 . Now
n−1 x ∈ NG (M 0 ) ∩ NG (P 0 ) = M and so x ∈ NM = MN. Thus P = MN.

    Let A be the split component of M 0 . Then M normalizes A and we define a
Weyl group W = M/CM (A) where CM (A) denotes the centralizer of A in M. Since
M 0 ⊂ CM (A), we know that W is a finite abelian group. The split component of M
is A′ = {a ∈ A : xax−1 = a for all x ∈ M} = {a ∈ A : wa = a for all a ∈ W }.
Let M ′ = CG (A′ ). If we can show that A′ is the split component of M ′ , then A′ is a
special vector subgroup.
    Let Φ+ = Φ(P 0 , A) denote the set of roots of A in P 0 , a the real Lie algebra of
A, and a+ the positive chamber of a with respect to Φ+ . Fix w ∈ W and define
aw = {H ∈ a : wH = H}. Since M normalizes P 0 , we have wΦ+ = Φ+ and
wa+ = a+ . Let k be the order of w. Then since a+ is convex, for any H ∈ a+ we have
Hw = H + wH + w 2 H + ... + w k−1H ∈ a+ with wHw = Hw . Thus a+                      +
                                                                           w = aw ∩ a 6= ∅
and so for any α ∈ Φ+ , the restriction of α to aw is non-zero. Since W is a finite
abelian group, an easy induction argument shows in fact that the restriction of α to
a′ , the real Lie algebra of A′ , is non-zero for every α ∈ Φ+ . Thus M ′ ∩G0 = CG0 (A′ ) =
CG0 (A) = M 0 .
    Let A′′ be the split component of M ′ . Thus A′ ⊂ A′′ . But since M ′ ∩ G0 = M 0 and
M ⊂ M ′ , we have A′′ = {a ∈ A : xax−1 = a for all x ∈ M ′ } ⊂ A′ . Thus A′ = A′′
is the split component of M ′ . This implies that A′ is a special vector subgroup and
that M ′ = CG (A′ ) is a Levi subgroup of G. But since the restriction of α to a′ , is
non-zero for every α ∈ Φ+ , we can choose a set of positive roots (Φ′ )+ of L(G) with
respect to L(A′ ) by restricting the roots in Φ+ . With this choice of positive roots, we
obtain a parabolic subgroup P ′ = M ′ N ′ of G with N ′ = N. Thus M ′ normalizes N.
It also normalizes M 0 since M ′ ∩ G0 = M 0 . Thus M ′ ⊂ NG (M 0 ) ∩ NG (P 0) = M.
Now M ′ = M so P ′ = MN = P .
   Let (P00, A0 ) be a minimal p-pair in G0 and let ∆ denote the set of simple roots of A0
in P00 . Then as usual the standard parabolic subgroups of G0 are indexed by subsets
Θ of ∆. Write (PΘ0 , AΘ ) for the standard parabolic pair of G0 corresponding to Θ ⊂ ∆
and write PΘ = NG (PΘ0 ), the N-parabolic subgroup of G lying over PΘ0 . Let NG (P00 , A0 )
be the set of elements in G that normalize both A0 and P00 . Clearly NG (P00, A0 ) ∩
G0 = P00 ∩ NG0 (A0 ) = CG0 (A0 ) = M00 . Write WG (P00 , A0 ) = NG (P00 , A0 )/M00 . Then
WG (P00 , A0 ) acts on ∆ and for each Θ ⊂ ∆ we write
                        W (Θ) = {w ∈ WG (P00, A0 ) : wΘ = Θ}.
Lemma 6.2. For all Θ ⊂ ∆,
                                   PΘ = ∪w∈W (Θ) wPΘ0 .

Proof: This follows from Lemma 3.8.
  Now that we have a simple method of computing the groups PΘ , we will give
examples to show the following unpleasant facts.
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 47

Fact 6.3. Let P10 and P20 be parabolic subgroups of G0 and let Pi = NG (Pi0 ), i = 1,2.
Then P10 ⊂ P20 does not imply that P1 ⊂ P2 .
Example 6.4. Let G = O(2n), n ≥ 2. Then G0 = SO(2n) and the minimal parabolic
subgroup B 0 of G0 is the group of upper triangular matrices in SO(2n) with A0 the
subgroup of diagonal matrices. The simple roots are
                    ∆ = {e1 − e2 , e2 − e3 , ..., en−1 − en , en−1 + en }.
The Weyl group WG (B 0 , A0 ) has order two and is generated by the sign change cn :
en 7→ −en that interchanges en−1 − en and en−1 + en . Thus a subset Θ of ∆ is stable
under cn just in case neither or both of en−1 ± en belong to Θ. So for example if
Θ = {en−1 − en }, then B 0 ⊂ PΘ0 , but B = B 0 ∪ cn B 0 is not contained in PΘ = PΘ0 .
  We call P0 a minimal N-parabolic subgroup of G if given any N-parabolic subgroup
P of G there is x ∈ G such that P0 ⊂ xP x−1 .
Fact 6.5. G need not have a minimal N-parabolic subgroup.
   Suppose P0 is a minimal N-parabolic subgroup of G. Then it is easy to see that
P00 = P0 ∩ G0 is a minimal parabolic subgroup of G0 . Now by Lemma 6.2, P0 meets
every connected component of G. But as Example 6.4 shows, there are N-parabolic
subgroups of O(2n) which are contained in the identity component SO(2n). Thus no
conjugate could contain the minimal N-parabolic subgroup.
   If P 0 = M 0 N is a Levi decomposition for P 0, then we obtained a Levi decomposition
P = MN for P = NG (P 0 ) by defining M = NG (M 0 ) ∩ P . Thus M depends on both
M 0 and P .
Fact 6.6. Suppose that P1 = M1 N1 and P2 = M2 N2 are N-parabolic subgroups of G
such that M10 = M20 , ie. P10 and P20 have the same Levi subgroup. Then it need not
be true that M1 = M2 , or even that M1 and M2 have the same number of connected
components.
Example 6.7. Let G = O(8) as in Example 6.4. Let P1 = PΘ1 where Θ1 = {e3 − e4 }
and let P2′ = PΘ2 where Θ2 = {e1 − e2 }. Then P1 = P10 is connected and P2′ = (P2′ )0 ∪
c4 (P2′ )0 meets both components of G. Let w = (13)(24) ∈ NG (A0 )/A0 be the Weyl
group element that permutes the pairs (e1 , e3 ) and (e2 , e4 ) and define P2 = wP2′ w −1 .
Then wAΘ2 w −1 = AΘ1 and so P20 = w(P2′ )0 w −1 and P10 both have Levi component
M10 = CG0 (AΘ1 ). However M1 = M10 is connected and M2 = M20 ∪ c2 M20 meets both
components of G.
   In addition to structural problems, the class of N-parabolic subgroups does not
yield a nice theory of parabolic induction. One of the basic cornerstones of represen-
tation theory in the connected case is that every irreducible admissible representation
is contained in a representation which is parabolically induced from a supercuspidal
representation and every tempered representation is a subrepresentation of a repre-
sentation which is parabolically induced from a discrete series representation. But
if supercuspidal and discrete series representations are defined as in the connected
48                       DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

case and in §2, then the Levi component M of a parabolic subgroup P has no su-
percuspidal or discrete series representations unless P is cuspidal. Thus we will not
in general be able to obtain all irreducible admissible or tempered representations of
G via induction from supercuspidal or discrete series representations of N-parabolic
subgroups.
Example 6.8. Define G = O(2) = SO(2) ∪ wSO(2) as in Remark 2.2. The only
parabolic subgroup of G0 = SO(2) ≃ F × is itself. Thus the only N-parabolic sub-
group of G is NG (G0 ) = G itself which has split component Z = {1}. But G has
no representations with compactly supported matrix coefficients, hence no supercus-
pidal representations. It also has no representations with square-integrable matrix
coefficients, hence no discrete series representations.
   As can be seen in Example 6.8, the problem with using the standard definitions
for supercuspidal and discrete series representations with N-parabolic subgroups P =
MN is that the split component of M may be smaller than the split component of
M 0 . In order to guarantee the existence of enough supercuspidal and discrete series
representations we could define a representation of M to be supercuspidal (respectively
discrete series) just in case its restriction to M 0 is supercuspidal (respectively discrete
series). Then it would be easy to prove as in Theorem 2.18 that every irreducible
admissible (respectively tempered) representation of G is contained in a representation
which is induced from a supercuspidal (respectively discrete series) representation of
an N-parabolic subgroup.
   Another basic property of parabolic induction in the connected case is the following.
Suppose that P1 = M1 N1 and P2 = M2 N2 are parabolic subgroups and σi , i = 1, 2, are
irreducible representations of Mi which are both either supercuspidal or discrete series.
Then if the induced representations IndG    Pi (σi ) are not disjoint, then the pairs (M1 , σ1 )
and (M2 , σ2 ) are conjugate. Further, in the discrete series case, the induced represen-
tations are equivalent. These properties fail in the disconnected case when the Pi are
N-parabolic subgroups of G and supercuspidal and discrete series representations are
defined as above.
Example 6.9. Let G = O(8) and define P1 and P2 as in Example 6.7. Recall in this
case that M1 = M10 ≃ GL(2)×GL(1)2 while M2 = M20 ∪c2 M20 ≃ GL(2)×GL(1)×O(2)
with M20 = GL(2) × GL(1) × SO(2) = M10 . Let σ0 = ρ ⊗ χ1 ⊗ χ2 be an irreducible
unitary supercuspidal representation of M10 = M20 where ρ is an irreducible unitary
supercuspidal representation of GL(2), χ1 is a unitary character of GL(1), and χ2 is
a non-trivial unitary character of GL(1) with χ22 = 1. Then σ0c2 = ρ ⊗ χ1 ⊗ χ−12 = σ0
so there is an irreducible representation σ2 of M2 which extends σ0 . Further,
                                 IndM
                                    M0
                                      2
                                        (σ0 ) = σ2 ⊕ (σ2 ⊗ η)
                                      2

where η is the non-trivial character of M2 /M20 . The representations σ2 and σ2 ⊗ η of
M2 would both be supercuspidal (and discrete series) since they both restrict to σ0
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 49

on M20 . Now
                                       M2
               IndG              G                    G             G
                  P20 (σ0 ) ≃ IndP2 IndM 0 (σ0 ) = IndP2 (σ2 ) ⊕ IndP2 (σ2 ⊗ η).
                                           2

  Since P10 and P20     are parabolic subgroups of G0 with the same Levi component
M10 = M20 we have
                                       0               0
                                  IndG              G
                                     P10 (σ0 ) ≃ IndP20 (σ0 ).

But σ1 = σ0 is an irreducible supercuspidal (and discrete series) representation of
M1 = M10 and
                                                           G0
                    IndG              G              G
                        P1 (σ1 ) = IndP10 (σ0 ) ≃ IndG0 IndP10 (σ0 )
                            0
             ≃ IndG     G              G              G             G
                  G0 IndP20 (σ0 ) ≃ IndP20 (σ0 ) ≃ IndP2 (σ2 ) ⊕ IndP2 (σ2 ⊗ η).

Thus we have irreducible supercuspidal (and discrete series) representations σ1 of M1
and σ2 of M2 so that
                          IndG             G             G
                             P1 (σ1 ) ≃ IndP2 (σ2 ) ⊕ IndP2 (σ2 ⊗ η).

Clearly M1 and M2 cannot be conjugate in G since M1 is connected while M2 is
not. Further, the representations IndGPi (σi ) have a nontrivial intertwining, but are not
equivalent.
   A final nice property of parabolic induction in the connected case is the theory of
R-groups. If P = MN is a parabolic subgroup and σ is an irreducible discrete series
representation of M, then R is a subgroup of WG (σ), the group of Weyl group elements
fixing σ, which determines the reducibility of IndG P (σ). Its most basic property is that
the dimension of the algebra of self-intertwining operators of IndG   P (σ) is equal to the
number of elements in R. The following example shows that there could not be such
a simple R-group theory in the disconnected case for N-parabolic subgroups.
Example 6.10. Let G0 = SL2 (F ) × SL2 (F ) = {(x, y) : x, y ∈ SL2 (F )}. Let G =
G0 ∪ γG0 where γ(x, y)γ −1 = (y, x). Let B1 = A1 N1 denote the usual Borel subgroup
of G1 = SL2 (F ) where A1 is the subgroup of diagonal elements and N1 is the subgroup
of upper triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal. Then B 0 = B1 × B1 is a Borel
subgroup of G0 and B = NG (B 0 ) = B 0 ∪ γB 0 . B 0 and B have Levi decompositions
B 0 = M 0 N and B = MN where M 0 = A0 = A1 × A1 , M = M 0 ∪ γM 0 , and
N = N1 × N1 . We have Weyl groups W (G0 , A0 ) = W (G1 , A1 ) × W (G1 , A1 ) ≃ Z2 × Z2
and W (G, A0 ) = W (G0 , A0 ) ∪ γW (G0 , A0 ) ≃ D8 , the dihedral group of order 8.
   Let χ1 be a non-trivial character of A1 ≃ F × of order two so that IndG      B1 (χ1 ) =
                                                                                 1


π1 ⊕ πs is a reducible principal series representation. Note that the R-group here
is R1 = W (G1 , A1 ) ≃ Z2 and we denote the irreducible constituents of the induced
representation by π1 , πs to indicate that they are parameterized by the trivial and sign
characters ρ1 and ρs of R1 respectively. Now let χ = χ1 ⊗ χ1 . Then
                    0
               IndG
                  B 0 (χ) ≃ (π1 ⊕ πs ) ⊗ (π1 ⊕ πs ) = π11 ⊕ π1s ⊕ πs1 ⊕ πss
50                     DAVID GOLDBERG AND REBECCA A. HERB

where for i, j ∈ {1, s}, we write πij = πi ⊗ πj . Note that πijγ ≃ πji , so that πijγ ≃ πij
if and only if i = j. Let Πij be an irreducible representation of G such that πij is
contained in the restriction of Πij to G0 . Then if i = j we have
                              IndG
                                 G0 (πij ) = Πij ⊕ (Πij ⊗ η)

where η is the non-trivial character of G/G0 and Πij ⊗ η 6≃ Πij . If i 6= j we have
                          IndG                          G
                             G0 (πij ) = Πij ≃ Πji = IndG0 (πji ).

In this case we also have Πij ⊗ η ≃ Πij . Thus we have
                        IndG            G
                           B 0 (χ) = IndG0 (π11 ⊕ π1s ⊕ πs1 ⊕ πss )

                     = Π11 ⊕ (Π11 ⊗ η) ⊕ Πss ⊕ (Πss ⊗ η) ⊕ 2Π1s .
   Note that the above decompositions are reflected in the R-groups as follows. First,
                      0
the R-group for IndG                       0                    0  0
                    B 0 (χ) is given by R = R1 × R1 = W (G , A ) ≃ Z2 × Z2 . It has 4
             0
characters ρij = ρi ⊗ ρj , i, j ∈ {1, s} corresponding to the irreducible representations
πij . The R-group for IndG                              0     0
                           B 0 (χ) is R = W (G, A0 ) = R ∪ γR . By abuse of notation we
will denote the non-trivial character of R/R0 by the same letter η as used above for
the non-trivial character of G/G0 and below for the non-trivial character of M/M 0 .
The irreducible representations of R are the characters ρii and ρii ⊗ η where
                               IndR    0
                                  R0 (ρii ) = ρii ⊕ (ρii ⊗ η)

and the two-dimensional irreducible representation
                             IndR    0               R    0
                                R0 (ρ1s ) = ρ1s ≃ IndR0 (ρs1 ).

Thus we have the irreducible constituents of IndG
                                                B 0 (χ) parameterized by the irreducible
representations of R and occurring with multiplicities given by the degrees of the
corresponding representations.
  Now we consider IndM                        0       0      γ
                       M 0 (χ). Since M = M ∪ γM and χ = χ, we have

                                IndM
                                   M 0 (χ) = σ ⊕ (σ ⊗ η)

where σ, σ⊗η are distinct one-dimensional unitary representations of M which restrict
to χ on M 0 . Now, using transitivity of induction and properties of tensor products,
we can write
                             IndG              G    M
                                 B 0 (χ) ≃ IndB IndM 0 (χ)
                             ≃ IndG              G
                                     B (σ) ⊕ IndB (σ ⊗ η).
Now since IndG               G
              B (σ ⊗ η) ≃ IndB (σ) ⊗ η, we see that

                               IndG           G
                                  B (σ) ⊕ (IndB (σ) ⊗ η) ≃

                   Π11 ⊕ (Π11 ⊗ η) ⊕ Πss ⊕ (Πss ⊗ η) ⊕ 2Π1s .
Thus we can assume that Π11 , Πss were chosen so that
                               IndG
                                  B (σ) ≃ Π11 ⊕ Πss ⊕ Π1s
   ADMISSIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF NON-CONNECTED REDUCTIVE p-ADIC GROUPS 51

and
                      IndGB (σ ⊗ η) ≃ (Π11 ⊗ η) ⊕ (Πss ⊗ η) ⊕ Π1s .
   This example exhibits a number of unpleasant features. First, we have irreducible
discrete series representations σ1 = σ and σ2 = σ ⊗ η of B such that IndG     B (σ1 ) and
IndB (σ2 ) have a non-trivial intertwining, but are not equivalent. Second, IndG
    G
                                                                                B (σ) has
3 inequivalent irreducible subrepresentations, each occuring with multiplicity one, so
that the dimension of its space of intertwining operators is 3. There are no subgroups
of any possible Weyl groups here with order 3.
