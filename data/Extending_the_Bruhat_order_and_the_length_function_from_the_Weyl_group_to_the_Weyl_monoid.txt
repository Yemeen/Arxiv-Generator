                                                  and the category of restricted duals by a generalized Tannaka-Krein re-

                                                  has similar properties as a reductive algebraic monoid. In particular there
                                                  are Bruhat and Birkhoff decompositions, the Weyl group replaced by the

                                                  give extensions of the Bruhat order from the Weyl group to the Weyl
                                                  monoid. We show that the Bruhat and Birkhoff cells are irreducible and
                                                  principal open in their closures. We give product decompositions of the
                                                  Bruhat and Birkhoff cells. We define extended length functions, which are
                                                  compatible with the extended Bruhat orders. We show a generalization
                                                  of some of the Tits axioms for twinned BN-pairs.

                                             Introduction
                                             The Kac-Moody group G constructed in [K,P 1] by V. Kac and D. Peterson is a
                                             group analogue of a semisimple, simply connected algebraic group. In particular
                                             there are Bruhat and Birkhoff decompositions
                                                          [˙
                                                   G =        B ǫ wB δ    (ǫ, δ) ∈ { (+, +), (−, −), (−, +), (+, −) } ,
                                                          w∈W


                                                                                      1
and also certain multiplicative decompositions of the Bruhat and Birkhoff cells
like BwB = Uw · wT · U and B − wB = (U w )− · wT · U . (Here T denotes a
maximal torus, W the Weyl group, and B = B + , B − denote opposite Borel
subgroups containing T .) V. Kac and D. Peterson equipped in [K,P 2] a sym-
metrizable Kac-Moody group with a coordinate ring, the algebra of strongly
regular functions C [G]. This coordinate ring has many properties in common
with the coordinate ring of a semisimple, simply connected algebraic group. It
is an integrally closed domain, even a unique factorization domain. It admits a
Peter and Weyl theorem, i.e.,
                                  M
                        C [G] ∼
                              =        L∗ (Λ) ⊗ L(Λ)
                                   Λ∈P +

as G × G-modules. (Here L(Λ) denotes an irreducible highest weight module
with highest weight Λ, L∗ (Λ) its restricted dual, and P + the set of dominant
weights.) As a difference, in the non-classical case, the multiplication map and
the inverse map of G do not induce comorphisms. V. Kac and D. Peterson
showed that the Zariski closures of the following Bruhat and Birkhoff cells are
obtained similarly to the classical case, using the Bruhat order of the Weyl
group W:
            [                                                     [
B ǫ wB ǫ =      B ǫ w′ B ǫ where ǫ ∈ {+, −},         B − wB =         B − w′ B .
            w ′ ≤w                                                 w ′ ≥w

In [M 1] we determined by a generalized Tannaka-Krein reconstruction the
monoid with coordinate ring (G,  b C [G])
                                       b associated to a natural category de-
termined by the modules L(Λ), Λ ∈ P + , and a category of duals determined by
L∗ (Λ), Λ ∈ P + . For its history in connection with V. Kac, D. Peterson, and
P. Slodowy please look at the introduction of [M 1]. The monoid G      b contains
the Kac-Moody group G as open dense unit group. In particular its coordinate
         b is isomorphic to the algebra of strongly regular functions C [G] by the
ring C [G]
restriction map.
This monoid is a purely infinite-dimensional phenomenon. In the classical case
it reduces to a semisimple simply connected algebraic group. It is a proper
analogue of such a group. For generalizing some results of classical invariant
theory it should be more fundamental than the Kac-Moody group itself.
In [M 1] we also showed that the monoid G  b has similar structural properties as a
normal reductive algebraic monoid. In particular there are Bruhat and Birkhoff
decompositions
               [
               ˙
      b =
      G              B ǫ ŵB δ   (ǫ, δ) ∈ { (+, +), (−, −), (−, +), (+, −) } ,
                c
             ŵ∈W


the Weyl group replaced by the Weyl monoid W,     c which is an analogue of a
Renner monoid. It contains the Weyl group as unit group and its idempotents
correspond bijectively to the faces of the Tits cone.


                                           2
In [M 2] we determined and investigated the C-valued points of C [G]. b Identi-
fying the elements of Gb with their evaluation morphisms, G b embeds in the set
                          b The Bruhat decompositions of G
of C-valued points of C [G].                                   b do not extend,
                                            b
but one of the Birkhoff decompositions of G extends to a decomposition of the
C-valued points.
In [M 1], [M 2] the Bruhat and Birkhoff cells have not been investigated further.
In particular their closure relations, which determine extensions of the Bruhat
order from the Weyl group to the Weyl monoid, have not been determined.
For reductive algebraic monoids these questions have already been investigated:
L. E. Renner studied in [Re 1], [Re 2] the closure relation of the Bruhat cells of
a reductive algebraic monoid. Transferred to the Renner monoid he called this
order the Bruhat-Chevalley order. He showed that all maximal chains between
two elements have the same length. He also showed a monoid version of one of
the Tits axioms for BN -pairs. An algebraic description of the Bruhat-Chevalley
order has been obtained by E. A. Pennel, M. S. Putcha, and R. E. Renner in
[Pe,Pu,Re]. An investigation of the lexicographic shellability has been started
by M. S. Putcha in [Pu].
A length function for the Renner monoid of matrices over a finite field has first
been introduced in [So] by L. Solomon. He also showed that this length func-
tion fits to the monoid generalization of one of the Tits axiom mentioned above.
A length function for the Renner monoid of an arbitrary reductive algebraic
monoid has been introduced and investigated by L. E. Renner in [Re 2] by a
different approach. It has the property that the length of a maximal chain of
the Bruhat-Chevalley order, which is contained in an orbit of the action of the
product of the Weyl group on the Renner monoid, is given by the difference
of the length of the maximal and the minimal element of the chain. He also
showed that this length function fits to his monoid generalization of one of the
Tits axioms. A subadditivity property has been shown by E. A. Pennel, M. S.
Putcha, and R. E. Renner in [Pe,Pu,Re].
L. E. Renner gave in [Re 3] a product decomposition of a Bruhat cell of the
wonderful compactification of a semisimple algebraic group.
Note also that many of these results just mentioned induce, by using the longest
element of the Weyl group, corresponding results for the Birkhoff cells.
In this article we show that some of these results are also valid for the monoid
Gb and the spectrum Specm C [G]: b In Section 2 we obtain a similar algebraic
                                                                          b and
description of the closure relations of the Bruhat and Birkhoff cells of G,
                                  b
of the Birkhoff cells of Specm C [G]. We show that these relations are actually
order relations, which is not automatic in our infinite dimensional situation.
Transferred to the Weyl monoid we call these orders the extended Bruhat and
Birkhoff orders.
We show that the Bruhat and Birkhoff cells are irreducible and principal open
in their closures. We equip the Bruhat and Birkhoff cells with their coordinate
rings as principal open sets and give product decompositions of these cells.
In Section 3 we extend the length function on the Weyl group to functions on



                                        3
the Weyl monoid, compatible with the extended Bruhat orders. We show a
generalization of some of the Tits axiom for groups with twinned BN -pairs.
To obtain these results is often more arduous as for reductive algebraic monoids,
and we have to use different methods for the following reasons: Most of the the-
orems of algebraic geometry, which are used to investigate algebraic groups and
monoids, break down for the infinite-dimensional varieties we have to use. In
the non-classical case the multiplication map of G b is not a morphism, only the
left and right multiplications with elements of G  b are morphisms. The Weyl
group and the Weyl monoid have infinitely many elements. In particular there
is no longest element of the Weyl group, and there are infinitely many Bruhat
and Birkhoff cells.
For our algebraic geometric investigations we mainly use the following two aids:
The explicit description of the coordinate ring of Gb by the Peter and Weyl theo-
rem. This allows to use properties of the action of parts of G  b on the irreducible
highest weight representations L(Λ), Λ ∈ P + , to obtain algebraic geometric
results. As an advantage our morphisms, closures, principal open sets are de-
scribed very explicitely by using matrix coefficients. The monoid G   b does not act
on the flag varieties, but it acts on the corresponding affine cones by morphisms.
This allows to make use of the combinatorial properties of these cones described
by V. Kac and D. Peterson in [K,P 1].

1    Preliminaries
In this section we collect some basic facts about Kac-Moody algebras, minimal
and formal Kac-Moody groups, and the corresponding monoid completions,
which are used later. One aim is to introduce our notation. Another aim is
to put these things, which are scattered between many articles and books, on
equal footing appropriate for our goals.
All the material stated in this section about Kac-Moody algebras can be found
in the books [K] (most results also valid for a field of characteristic zero with
the same proofs), [Mo,Pi]. The facts about the minimal Kac-Moody group can
be found in [K,P 1], [K,P 3], [Mo,Pi], about the formal Kac-Moody group in


                                         4
[Sl], about the Kostant cones in [K,P 1], [Mo,Pi], about the algebra of strongly
regular functions in [K,P 2], about the faces of the Tits cone in [Loo], [Sl], [M 1].
The facts about the monoid completion of the minimal Kac-Moody group can
be found in [M 1], about the spectrum of F-valued points of its coordinate ring
in [M 2].
We denote by N = Z+ , Q+ , resp. R+ the sets of strictly positive numbers of Z,
Q, resp. R , and the sets N0 = Z+       +    +
                                   0 , Q0 , R0 contain, in addition, the zero. In
the whole paper, F is a field of characteristic 0 and F× its group of units.
Generalized Cartan matrices: Starting point for the construction of a Kac-
Moody algebra and its associated simply connected minimal and formal Kac-
Moody groups is a generalized Cartan matrix, which is a matrix A = (aij ) ∈
Mn (Z) with aii = 2, aij ≤ 0 for all i 6= j, and aij = 0 if and only if aji = 0.
Denote by l the rank of A, and set I := {1, 2, . . . , n}.
For the properties of the generalized Cartan matrices, in particular their classi-
fication, we refer to the book [K]. In this paper we assume A to be symmetriz-
able.
Realizations: A simply connected minimal free realization of A consists of
dual free Z-modules H, P of rank 2n − l, and linear independent sets Π∨ =
{h1 , . . . , hn } ⊆ H, Π = {α1 , . . . , αn } ⊆ P such that αi (hj ) = aji , i, j =
1, . . . , n. Furthermore there exist (non-uniquely determined) fundamental do-
minant weights Λ1 , . . . , Λn ∈ P such that Λi (hj ) = δij , i, j = 1, . . . , n. P is
called the weight lattice, and Q := Z-span { αi | i ∈ I } the root lattice. Set
Q±            ±                             ±
  0 := Z0 -span { αi | i ∈ I }, and Q := Q0 \ {0}.
                                                    ±

We fix a system of fundamental dominant weights Λ1 , . . . , Λn , and extend h1 , . . . , hn ∈
H, Λ1 , . . . , Λn ∈ P to a pair of dual bases h1 , . . . , h2n−l ∈ H, Λ1 , . . . , Λ2n−l ∈ P .
We set Hrest := Z-span { hi | i = n + 1, . . . , 2n − l }.
The Weyl group: Identify H and P with the corresponding sublattices of the
following vector spaces over F :

           h := hF := H ⊗Z F              ,        h∗ := h∗F := P ⊗Z F .

h∗ is interpreted as the dual of h. Order the elements of h∗ by λ ≤ λ′ if and
only if λ′ − λ ∈ Q+     0.
Choose a symmetric matrix B ∈ Mn (Q) and a diagonal matrix D = diag(ǫ1 , . . . , ǫn ) ,
ǫ1 , . . . , ǫn ∈ Q+ , such that A = DB. Define a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear
form on h by:

      (hi | h) = (h | hi ) := αi (h) ǫi                 i∈I, h∈h,
              (h′ | h′′ ) := 0                          h′ , h′′ ∈ hrest := Hrest ⊗ F .

Denote the induced nondegenerate symmetric form on h∗ also by ( | ).
The Weyl group W = W(A) is the Coxeter group with generators σi , i ∈ I, and
relations
                                                  mij

The Weyl group W acts faithfully and contragrediently on h and h∗ by

σi h := h − αi (h)hi    ,   σi λ := λ − λ(hi ) αi           ,     i ∈ I,   h ∈ h,   λ ∈ h∗ ,

leaving the lattices H, Q, P , and the forms invariant. ∆re := W { αi | i ∈ I }
is called the set of real roots, and ∆∨
                                      re := W { hi | i ∈ I } the set of real coroots.
The map αi 7→ hi , i ∈ I, can be extended to a W-equivariant bijection α 7→ hα .
The Tits cone and its faces: To illustrate the action of W on h∗R geometri-
cally, for J ⊆ I define

  FJ    :=   { λ ∈ h∗R | λ(hi ) = 0 for i ∈ J , λ(hi ) > 0 for i ∈ I \ J } ,
  FJ    :=   { λ ∈ h∗R | λ(hi ) = 0 for i ∈ J , λ(hi ) ≥ 0 for i ∈ I \ J } .

FJ is a finitely generated convex cone with relative interior FJ . The parabolic
subgroup W J of W is the stabilizer of every element λ ∈ FJ . For σ ∈ W call
σFJ a facet of type J.
The fundamental chamber C := { λ ∈ h∗R | λ(hi ) ≥ 0 for i ∈ I } is a funda-
mental region for the action of W onṠthe convex cone X := W C , which is called
the Tits cone. The partition C = J⊆I FJ induces a W-invariant partition of
X into facets.
We denote the set of faces of the Tits cone X by R(X). These faces can be
described as follows: A set Θ ⊆ I is called special, if either Θ = ∅, or else
all connected components of the generalized Cartan submatrix (aij )i,j∈Θ are of
non-finite type. Set Θ⊥ := { i ∈ I | aij = 0 for all j ∈ Θ }. Every face of the
Tits cone X is W-conjugate to exactly one of the faces

R(Θ) := X ∩ { λ ∈ h∗R | λ(hi ) = 0 for all i ∈ Θ } = W Θ⊥ F Θ                       ,   Θ special .

The parabolic subgroup W Θ is the pointwise stabilizer of R(Θ), and the parabolic
subgroup W Θ∪Θ⊥ is the stabilizer of the set R(Θ) as a whole.
The relative interior of R(Θ) is given by the union of the facets σFΘ∪Θf , where
σ ∈ W Θ⊥ , and Θf is a subset of Θ⊥ , which is either empty, or else for which all
connected components of (aij )i,j∈Θf are of finite type.
The Weyl monoid: The Weyl group acts on the monoid ( R(X) , ∩ ). The
semidirect product R(X) ⋊ W consists of the set R(X) × W with the structure
of a monoid given by

                        (R, σ) · (S, τ )    := (R ∩ σS, στ ) .

For R ∈ R(X) let ZW (R) := { σ ∈ W | σλ = λ for all λ ∈ R } be the pointwise
                                 c is defined as the monoid R(X)⋊W factored
stabilizer of R. The Weyl monoid W
by the congruence relation

         (R, σ) ∼ (R′ , σ ′ ) : ⇐⇒         R = R′       and σ ′ σ −1 ∈ ZW (R) .

                                                6

Recall that a monoid M is called an inverse monoid, if for every element m ∈
M there exists a unique element minv ∈ M , such that mminv m = m and
minv mminv = minv . The inverse map inv : M → M is an involution extending

The following formulas, which follow immediately from the definition of W,
be used later at many places: Let w ∈ W and Θ be special. Then

             wε (R(Θ))w−1 = ε (R(Θ)) ⇐⇒                   w ∈ W Θ∪Θ⊥ ,          (3)
wε (R(Θ)) = ε (R(Θ)) ⇐⇒              ε (R(Θ))w = ε (R(Θ)) ⇐⇒ w ∈ W Θ . (4)

The Kac-Moody algebra: The Kac-Moody algebra g = g(A) is the Lie alge-
bra over F generated by the abelian Lie algebra h and 2n elements ei , fi , (i ∈ I),
with the following relations, which hold for any i, j ∈ I, h ∈ h :

        [ei , fj ] = δij hi , [h, ei ] = αi (h)ei , [h, fi ] = −αi (h)fi ,

The Chevalley involution ∗ : g → g is the involutive anti-automorphism deter-
mined by e∗i = fi , fi∗ = ei , h∗ = h, (i ∈ I, h ∈ h).
The nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form ( | ) on h extends uniquely to a
nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form ( | ) on g.
We have the root space decomposition
      M
 g=       gα where gα := { x ∈ g | [h, x] = α(h) x for all h ∈ h } .
      α∈h∗

In particular g0 = h, gαi = Fei , and g−αi = Ffi , i ∈ I.
The set of roots ∆ := { α ∈ h∗ \ {0} | gα 6= {0} } is invariant under the Weyl
group, ∆ = −∆, and ∆ spans the root lattice Q . We have ∆re ⊆ ∆ , and
∆im := ∆ \ ∆re is called the set of imaginary roots.
∆, ∆re , and ∆im decompose into the disjoint union of the sets of positive and

There is the triangular decomposition g = n ⊕h⊕n , where n := α∈∆± gα .
Irreducible highest weight representations: For every Λ ∈ h∗ there exists,
unique up to isomorphism, an irreducible representation (L(Λ), πΛ ) of g with
highest weight Λ. It is h-diagonalizable, and we denote its set of weights by
P (Λ). Any such representation carries a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form
hh | ii : L(Λ) × L(Λ) → F which is contravariant, i.e., hhv | xwii = hhx∗ v | wii
for all v, w ∈ L(Λ), x ∈ g. This form is unique up to a nonzero multiplicative
scalar.
The category Oadm : The category O is defined as follows: Its objects are the
g-modules V , which have the properties:
(1) V is h-diagonalizable with finite dimensional weight spaces.
                                               . , λm ∈ h∗ , such that the set of

weights P (V ) of V is contained in the union 1=1 { λ ∈ h∗ | λ ≤ λi }.
The morphisms of O are the morphisms of g-modules.
Call a g-module V admissible, if V is h-diagonalizable with set of weights
P (V ) ⊆ P and the elements of gα act locally nilpotent on V for all α ∈ ∆re . (If
the generalized Cartan matrix is degenerate, then admissible is slightly stronger
than integrable, which means V is h-diagonalizable and the elements of gα act
locally nilpotent on V for all α ∈ ∆re .) Examples of admissible representations
are the adjoint representation (g , ad ), and the irreducible highest weight rep-
resentations (L(Λ), πΛ ), Λ ∈ P + := P ∩ C.
We denote by Oadm the full subcategory of the category O, whose objects are
admissible modules. This category generalizes the category of finite dimensional
representations of a semisimple Lie algebra, keeping the complete reducibility
theorem. Every object of Oadm is isomorphic to a direct sum of the admissible
irreducible highest weight modules L(Λ), Λ ∈ PS+ . The set of weights of a mod-
ule of Oadm is contained in X ∩ P because of Λ∈P + P (Λ) = X ∩ P .

The unit group G of G  b is generated by the elements of (1) and (2). It is the
minimal Kac-Moody group, which we call Kac-Moody group for short.
The Chevalley involution ∗ : G  b→G   b is the involutive anti-isomorphism deter-
mined by exp(xα )∗ := exp(x∗α ), t∗ := t, e(R)∗ := e(R), where xα ∈ gα , α ∈ ∆re ,

In this paper we are interested in the monoid G    b and the spectrum of F-valued
points of its coordinate ring, which will be defined soon. To describe the F-
valued points we needQa second monoid G     cf , extending G,
                                                            b which we define al-

extends in the obvious way to a Lie bracket of gf . Every g-module of Oadm can
be extended to a gf -module. The monoid G    cf can be characterized as follows:

(b) Gcf extends G b and it contains the following elements:
(4) For every x ∈ nf there exists an element exp(x) ∈ G     cf , such that for any
admissible representation (V, π) we have

G                  b and the elements of (4).

The unit group Gf of Gcf is generated by G and the elements of (4). It is the
formal Kac-Moody group.

     that the groups G, Gf as well as the monoid G,  cf act faithfully on the
sum Λ∈P + L(Λ).
The groups G and Gf have the following important structural properties:
(a) The elements of (1) induce an embedding of the torus H ⊗Z F× into G ⊆ Gf .
Its image is denoted by T . For α ∈ ∆re the elements of (2) induce an embedding
of (gα , +) into G ⊆ Gf . Its image Uα is called the root group belonging to α.

Sets with coordinate rings: We call a point separating algebra of functions
F [A] on a set A a coordinate ring. The closed sets of the Zariski topology on A
are given by the zero sets of the functions of F [A]. The set A is irreducible if
and only if F [A] is an integral domain.
A morphism of sets with coordinate rings (A, F [A]) and (B, F [B]) consists of a
map φ : A → B, whose comorphism φ∗ : F [B] → F [A] exists. In particular a
morphism is Zariski continuous.
If (B, F [B]) is a set with coordinate ring, and A is a nonempty subset of B, we
get a coordinate ring on A by restricting the functions of F [B] to A.
If (A, F [A]) is a set with coordinate ring and f ∈ F [A] \ {0}, the principal open
set DA (f ) := { a ∈ A | f (a) 6= 0 } is equipped with a coordinate ring by iden-
tifying the localization F [A]f in the obvious way with an algebra of functions
on DA (f ). The principal open set DA (f ) is irreducible if and only if A is irre-
ducible.
If (A, F [A]) and (B, F [B]) are sets with coordinate rings, then the product A×B
is equipped with a coordinate ring by identifying the tensor product F [A]⊗F [B]
in the obvious way with an algebra of functions on A × B. The product A × B
is irreducible if and only if A and B are irreducible.
The coordinate ring of G:      b By the Tannaka Krein reconstruction given in
[M 1], Section 4, the monoid G   b is equipped with a natural coordinate ring. It
can also be defined as follows: For a module V of Oadm , v, w ∈ V , and hh | ii
a nondegenerate symmetric contravariant bilinear form on V , call the function
fvw : G b → F defined by fvw (x) := hhv | xwii, x ∈ G, b a matrix coefficient of G.
                                                                                 b
The set of all such matrix coefficients F [G]b is a coordinate ring on G,b which is
                                       b
an integral domain. For a set M ⊆ G we denote by M its Zariski closure.
The Chevalley involution ∗ : G  b→G   b is a morphism. We denote its comorphism
                b        b
also by ∗ : F [G] → F [G] and call it Chevalley involution. Right and left multi-
plications with elements of G  b are morphisms. In particular an action of G b×G  b
     b
on G from the right by morphisms is given by

                        x (g, h) := g ∗ xh              b .
                                              x, g, h ∈ G

The comorphisms induce an action of G  b×G   b on F [G]
                                                      b from the left.
In this article we fix a nondegenerate symmetric contravariant bilinear form
on L(Λ) for every Λ ∈ P + . The coordinate ring F [G]    b admits a Peter-Weyl

theorem: The map Λ∈P + L(Λ) ⊗ L(Λ) → F [G] induced by v ⊗ w 7→ fvw is an
isomorphism of G b × G-modules.

The algebra of strongly regular functions F [G] is obtained by restricting the
                b onto G. The restriction map is an isomorphism from F [G]
functions of F [G]                                                           b to
F [G]. Restricting the functions of F [G] onto G′ , resp. Trest gives the algebras
F [G′ ], resp. F [Trest ] the first identical with the algebra of strongly regular
functions as defined in [K,P 2], the second the classical coordinate ring of the

The monoids Tb, N b, G
                     b are the Zariski closures of T , N , G, and G is the Zariski
open dense unit group of G.b
Denote by ≤ the Bruhat order on W. Lemma 3.4 of [K,P 2] is also valid for the
slightly enlarged group G, which we use here. It gives the relative closures of

The Kostant cones: Fix Λ ∈ P + . Recall that we have fixed a nondegener-
ate symmetric contravariant bilinear form hh | ii on L(Λ). Equip L(Λ) with
the coordinate ring F [L(Λ)] generated by the matrix coefficients fv , v ∈ L(Λ),
where fv (w) := hhv | wii for all w ∈ L(Λ). It is a symmetric algebra in the
linear space given by these functions. For a set M ⊆ L(Λ) denote by M its
Zariski closure.
The set VΛ := G(L(Λ)Λ ) ⊆ L(Λ) is Zariski closed. It is called Kostant cone.
Now assume that Λ ∈ FJ , J ⊆ I. Denote by W J the set of minimal coset repre-
sentatives of W/W J . Because the parabolic subgroup W J is the W-stabilizer of
Λ, the evaluation map W J → W J Λ = WΛ is bijective. By this map the Bruhat
order on W J induces an order on WΛ. The corresponding inverse order on WΛ
is denoted by . If λ, µ ∈ WΛ then λ  µ implies λ ≤ µ.
For v ∈ L(Λ) denote by supp(v) the set of weights of the nonzero weight space
components of v. Denote by S(v) the convex hull of supp(v) in h∗R .
For v ∈ VΛ \ {0} the vertices of S(v) are given by S(v) ∩ WΛ. The edges of
S(v) are parallel to real roots. The two vertices of an edge are comparable in
. S(v) has one maximal and one minimal vertex.
For λ ∈ WΛ set
       VΛ+ (λ)   :=   { v ∈ VΛ \ {0} | λ is the minimal vertex of S(v) } ,
       VΛ− (λ)   := { v ∈ VΛ \ {0} | λ is the maximal vertex of S(v) } .

The Kostant cones are the affine cones of the flag varieties. For our investigations
they are more important than the flag varieties, because the monoid G     b acts on
the Kostant cones by morphisms, but it does not act on the flag varieties. In
                b
particular VΛ = G(L(Λ)  Λ ).

(2) Due to equations (5) the relations ≤++ , ≤−− , and ≤−+ extend the Bruhat
order ≤ of the Weyl group W.
The relations ≤++ , ≤−− , and ≤−+ are the closure relations of orbit decompo-
sitions. Therefore these relations are reflexive and transitive. But we can not
conclude that they are antisymmetric, because for this we would need to know
that the orbits are locally closed.

  −δ inv −ǫ           c
B ŵ B , ŵ ∈ W, ǫ, δ ∈ {+, −}. From the definition of the extended
Bruhat orders follows immediately, that the inverse map inv : W → W is an
isomorphism of the relations (W, ≤ǫǫ ) and (W, ≤−ǫ−ǫ ), ǫ = +, −. It is an auto-
morphism of (W, ≤−+ ).

                                 b
because the coordinate ring F [G] does not contain the matrix coefficients of the
admissible lowest weight representations. Even the relative closures of BwB − ,
w ∈ W, in the Kac-Moody group G have not been determined.
Our first aim is to determine these relations explicitely. To this end we intro-
                                           c which are similar to the standard
duce three normal forms of the elements of W,

Remarks: (1) By applying the inverse map inv : W    c→W  c to an element ŵ in
normal form I resp. II we obtain the element ŵinv in normal form II resp. I. By
applying this map to an element ŵ in normal form III we obtain the element
ŵinv in normal form III.
(2) As shown in the following proof, the multiplication map of W restricts to
bijective maps

Therefore we can read off the normal forms I and II from the normal form III.
Proof: 1) We first show the existence and uniqueness of normal form I: We
         Ṡ
     c=
have W     Θ special Wε (R(Θ))W, and by using formulas (3) and (4) we find

                              ⊥                                    ⊥

 = W Θ∪Θ ε (R(Θ))W = W Θ∪Θ ε (R(Θ))W Θ W Θ = W Θ∪Θ ε (R(Θ))W Θ .

To show the uniqueness let w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 and w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ be normal forms
                         c Then by using equation (2) we find
I of the same element of W.

ε (w1 R(Θ))w1 w2 = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 = w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ = ε (w1′ R(Θ′ ))w1′ w2′ ,

which is equivalent to

    w1 R(Θ) = w1′ R(Θ′ )      and       w1′ w2′ (w1 w2 )−1 ∈ w1′ W Θ′ (w1′ )−1 .

From the first equation follows Θ = Θ′ and w1 W Θ∪Θ⊥ = w1′ W Θ∪Θ⊥ . Since the
minimal coset representatives w1 , w1′ are uniquely determined we find w1 = w1′ .
Inserting in the second expression we get w2′ w2−1 ∈ W Θ , resp. W Θ w2′ = W Θ w2 .
Because the minimal coset representatives w2 , w2′ are uniquely determined this
implies w2 = w2′ .
2) The existence and uniqueness of normal form II follows from the existence
                                                               c → W.
and uniqueness of normal form I by using the inverse map inv : W   c
3) If we show the bijectivity of the restricted multiplication maps (6), then the
existence and uniqueness of normal form I and II together with formula (3)
imply the existence and uniqueness of normal form III. We only have to show
the bijectivity of the first map, the bijectivity of the second follows by applying
the inverse map of W.
                          ⊥                    ⊥
We have W = W Θ∪Θ W Θ∪Θ⊥ = W Θ∪Θ W Θ⊥ W Θ , and the corresponding
multiplicative decomposition of the elements are unique. It remains to show
            ⊥                              ⊥
that W Θ∪Θ W Θ ⊆ W Θ . If w1 ∈ W Θ∪Θ and w2 ∈ W Θ⊥ then for all i ∈ Θ we
have

                          w1 w2 αi = w1 αi ∈ ∆+
                                              re .

Therefore w1 w2 ∈ W Θ .
                                                                                    

The following theorem describes the relations ≤++ , ≤−− , and ≤−+ explicitely.
The description of 1a) (iii) is similar to the result for reductive algebraic monoids
obtained in [Pe,Pu,Re].
For J ⊆ I and w ∈ W denote by wJ the minimal coset representative of wW J ,
and by J w the minimal coset representative of W J w.
Theorem 2.3
                                                                    c in normal
1a) Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 , ŵ′ = w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ be elements of W
form I. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) ŵ ≤++ ŵ′
(ii) Θ ⊇ Θ′ and there exists an element w ∈ W Θ′⊥ such that w1 ≤ (w1′ w)Θ and
w2 ≥ Θ (w−1 w2′ ).
(iii) Θ ⊇ Θ′ and there exists an element w ∈ W Θ′⊥ W Θ such that w1 ≤ w1′ w
and w2 ≥ w−1 w2′ .
                                                                   c in normal
b) Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 , ŵ′ = w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ be elements of W
form II. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) ŵ ≤−− ŵ′
(ii) Θ ⊇ Θ′ and there exists an element w ∈ W Θ′⊥ such that w1 ≥ (w1′ w)Θ and
w2 ≤ Θ (w−1 w2′ ).
(iii) Θ ⊇ Θ′ and there exists an element w ∈ W Θ′⊥ W Θ such that w1 ≥ w1′ w
and w2 ≤ w−1 w2′ .
                                                                   c both in normal
2) Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 , ŵ′ = w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ be elements of W
form I, or both in normal form II. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) ŵ ≥−+ ŵ′
(ii) Θ ⊇ Θ′ and there exists an element w ∈ W Θ′⊥ such that w1 ≥ (w1′ w)Θ and
w2 ≥ Θ (w−1 w2′ ).
Proof: We only have to prove the statements of the theorem, which use normal
form I. Then the statements which use normal form II follow by applying the
                  c → W,
inverse map inv : W    c compare Remark (3) following Definition 2.1, and
Remark (1) following Proposition 2.2.
(a) First we show the equivalence of (ii) and (iii) of 1a): Let (ii) be valid.
Choose an element w̃ ∈ W Θ such that Θ (w−1 w2′ ) = w̃−1 w−1 w2′ . Then we have
                    w1 ≤ (w1′ w)Θ = (w1′ ww̃)Θ ≤ w1′ ww̃ ,
                          w2 ≥ Θ (w−1 w2′ ) = (ww̃)−1 w2′ .
Let (iii) be valid. Write the element w in the form w = w̃ w̃′ with w̃ ∈ W Θ′⊥ and
w̃′ ∈ W Θ . From w1 ≤ w1′ w follows w1 = w1Θ ≤ (w1′ w)Θ = (w1′ w̃)Θ . Similarly
we get w2 ≥ Θ (w̃−1 w2′ ).
The easy part in the following proof of the equivalence (i) and (ii) in 1), 2a)
is the direction from (ii) to (i). The proof of this direction, which uses only
the formulas for the relative closures of the Bruhat and Birkhoff cells of a Kac-
Moody group, is for 1a) similar, and for 2) a modification of the corresponding
proof in [Pe,Pu,Re]. The proof of the opposite direction is quite different.
(b) To prepare the proof of the direction from (i) to (ii) of 1a) and 2) first note:

                                         17
Let Λ ∈ P + , and let v, v ′ ∈ VΛ such that hhv | v ′ ii =
                                                         6 0. Since different weight
spaces of L(Λ) are hh | ii-orthogonal we have supp(v) ∩ supp(v ′ ) 6= ∅. Let λ be
an element of this intersection. Then the biggest vertex of S(v) is bigger than
λ, which is bigger than the smallest vertex of S(v ′ ) (with respect to ).
(c) Now we can prove the direction from (i) to (ii) of 1a) and 2): Let ǫ ∈ {+, −}
and B ǫ ŵB ⊆ B ǫ ŵ′ B.
Choose an element Λ ∈ FΘ ∩ P . Choose elements vw1 Λ ∈ L(Λ)w1 Λ \ {0} and
vw2 Λ ∈ L(Λ)w2 Λ \ {0}. To cut short the notation set g := fvw1 Λ v(w )−1 Λ .
                                                                           2

Since Λ ∈ R(Θ), for any element n̂ŵ ∈ N̂ belonging to ŵ we have
                      

                                  
           g(n̂ŵ ) =   vw1 Λ | n̂w1 ε(R(Θ))w2 v(w2 )−1 Λ    6= 0 .

Therefore g does not vanish entirely on the closure B ǫ ŵ′ B, which implies that
it also can not vanish entirely on B ǫ ŵ′ B. Therefore there exists an element
n̂ŵ′ ∈ N̂ belonging to ŵ′ , and elements uǫ ∈ U ǫ , u ∈ U , such that
                        

                                              
        g(uǫ n̂ŵ′ u) =   (uǫ )∗ vw1 Λ | n̂w1′ ε(R(Θ′ ))w2′ uv(w2 )−1 Λ    6= 0 .

The vertices of S(uv(w2 )−1 Λ ) are of the form

       w̃Λ   with    w̃ ∈ W    such that w̃Θ ≤ ((w2 )−1 )Θ = (w2 )−1 .

Therefore the vertices of S(n̂w1′ ε(R(Θ′ ))w2′ uv(w2 )−1 Λ ) are of the form

w1′ w2′ w̃Λ with    w̃ ∈ W    such that w̃Θ ≤ (w2 )−1         and w2′ w̃Λ ∈ R(Θ′ ) .

Here the inequality w̃Θ ≤ (w2 )−1 is equivalent to Θ (w̃−1 ) ≤ w2 . By comparing
the type of facets in the formula w2′ w̃Λ ∈ R(Θ′ ) on the left and on the right we
find

             FΘ ⊆ FΘ′     resp. Θ ⊇ Θ′       resp. R(Θ) ⊆ R(Θ′ ) .

We also get w2′ w̃ ∈ W Θ′ ∪Θ′⊥ W Θ = W Θ′⊥ W Θ′ W Θ = W Θ′⊥ W Θ . Set w := w2′ w̃.
We have shown that Θ ⊇ Θ′ , and the vertices of S(n̂w1′ ε(R(Θ′ ))w2′ uv(w2 )−1 Λ ) are
of the form
                                                        Θ
       w1′ wΛ   with    w ∈ W Θ′⊥ W Θ      such that        (w−1 w2′ ) ≤ w2 .

w1 Λ is the biggest resp. smallest vertex of (uǫ )∗ vw1 Λ for ǫ = + resp. ǫ = −.
Using (b) we conclude that there exists an element w ∈ W Θ′⊥ W Θ such that
Θ
  (w−1 w2′ ) ≤ w2 and
                          
                             w1′ wΛ for ǫ = +
                     w1 Λ                                .
                             w1′ wΛ for ǫ = −

These inequalities are equivalent to
                           
                         Θ    ≤ (w1′ w)Θ         for ǫ = +
                w1 = w1                                           .
                              ≥ (w1′ w)Θ         for ǫ = −

                                           18
Obviously there also exists an element w ∈ W Θ′⊥ , which satisfies the required
inequalities..
(d) To prepare the proof of the direction from (ii) to (i) of 1a) and 2), we need
the following formula: Let w1 , w1′ ∈ W such that w1 ≤ w1′ for ǫ = +, and
                                     ⊥
w1 ≥ w1′ for ǫ = −. Let w2 ∈ Θ∪Θ W. By using equation (5) for the relative
closures of the Bruhat and Birkhoff cells of G, and formula (δ) stated in the
part ’The minimal and formal Kac-Moody group G and Gf , the monoids G       b and
cf ’ of the section ’Preliminaries’ we find
G

                 B ǫ w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 B ⊆ B ǫ w1 Bε (R(Θ))w2 B ⊆ B ǫ w1′ Bε (R(Θ))w2 B
 ⊆ B ǫ w1′ Bε (R(Θ))w2 B = B ǫ w1′ ε (R(Θ))w2 w2−1 UΘ⊥ w2 B = B ǫ w1′ ε (R(Θ))w2 B .
                                              |    {z   }
                                                      ⊆U +

(e) Now we show the direction from (ii) to (i) of 1a) and 2): By using (d) and
formulas (2), (4) we find

(w2′ )−1 wε (R(Θ))T w2     =   ((w2′ )−1 w)Θ ε (R(Θ))T w2 ⊆ Bw2−1 ε (R(Θ))w2 B
                                                
                           =   Bε w2−1 R(Θ) B .

The closure B is a monoid. It contains B. It contains the closure T = Tb, in
particular it contains the elements e(R), R ∈ R(X). Therefore the last set of
the preceeding formula is contained in B. From this follows

   w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))wε (R(Θ))w2 T = w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ (w2′ )−1 wε (R(Θ))w2 T
                           ∈ w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ B ⊆ B ǫ w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ B .

On the other hand we get by using formula (3):

w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))wε (R(Θ))w2 T = w1′ wε (R(Θ′ ))ε (R(Θ))w2 T = w1′ wε (R(Θ))w2 T .

Therefore

               B ǫ w1′ wε (R(Θ))w2 B ⊆ B ǫ w1′ ε (R(Θ′ ))w2′ B .                 (7)

Due to the first inequalities of 1a) (ii) and 2) (ii) we get by using (d) and formula
(4) once more:

B ǫ w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 B ⊆ B ǫ (w1′ w)Θ ε (R(Θ))w2 B = B ǫ w1′ wε (R(Θ))w2 B . (8)

From the inclusions (7) and (8) follows (i).
                                                                        
By using the explicit description of ≤++ , ≤−− , and ≤−+ given in the last
theorem, we now can show that these relations are order relations.
                                                                     c
Theorem 2.4 The relations ≤++ , ≤−− , and ≤−+ are order relations on W,
which extend the Bruhat order on W.

                                         19
Proof: It remains to show that these relations are antisymmetric. Let ŵ =
                                        c be elements of W
w1 e(R(Θ))w2 , ŵ′ = w1′ e(R(Θ′ ))w2′ ∈ W                c in normal form I,
and let ŵ ≤++ ŵ′ , ŵ′ ≤++ ŵ. Due to the last theorem we have Θ = Θ′ , and
there exist elements w, w̃ ∈ W Θ⊥ such that
                           w1 ≤ (w1′ w)Θ , w1′ ≤ (w1 w̃)Θ ,                           (9)
                         w2 ≥ Θ (w−1 w2′ ) , w2′ ≥ Θ (w̃−1 w2 ) .                    (10)
                                                                             ⊥
Remark (2) following Proposition 2.2 implies W Θ W Θ⊥ = W Θ∪Θ W Θ⊥ = W Θ .
Therefore the inequalities of (9) and (10) are equivalent to
                              w1 ≤ w1′ w     , w1′ ≤ w1 w̃ ,                         (11)
                            w2 ≥ w−1 w2′     , w2′ ≥ w̃−1 w2 .                       (12)
                     ⊥
Since w2 , w2′ ∈ Θ∪Θ W and w−1 , w̃−1 ∈ W Θ⊥ ⊆ W Θ∪Θ⊥ from (12) follows
l(w2 ) ≥ l(w−1 w2′ ) = l(w−1 ) + l(w2′ ) ≥ l(w2′ ) ≥ l(w̃−1 w2 ) = l(w̃−1 ) + l(w2 ) ≥ l(w2 ) .
This implies l(w2 ) = l(w2′ ), and inserting in this chain of inequalities we find
l(w−1 ) = l(w̃−1 ) = 0. Therefore w−1 = w̃−1 = 1. Inserting in (11), (12), we get
                                w1 ≤ w1′     , w1′ ≤ w1 ,                            (13)
                                w2 ≥   w2′   , w2′ ≥ w2 .                            (14)
Due to the antisymmetry of the Bruhat order of W we get w1 = w1′ and w2 = w2′ .

The antisymmetry of ≤−+ can be proved similarly, only ’≤’ has to be exchanged
by ’≥’ in (9), (11), (13).
                              c→W
Because the inverse map inv : W     c is an isomorphism of the relations ≤++
and ≤−− , also the relation ≤−− is antisymmetric.
                                                                           
For Λ ∈ P + and λ, µ ∈ WΛ fix elements vλ ∈ L(Λ)λ \ {0}, vµ ∈ L(Λ)µ \ {0}

Proof: 1) Let ŵ = w1 ε (e(R(Θ)))w2 be in normal form I. Let ǫ ∈ {+, −} and
δ = +.
We first show the inclusion ’⊆’ of (16). Because of the Bruhat and Birkhoff
decompositions of G,    b any element of G b can be written in the form uǫ n̂ŵ′ u with
uǫ ∈ U ǫ , u ∈ U , and n̂ŵ′ ∈ N b belonging to ŵ′ ∈ W.
                                                       c
If uǫ n̂ŵ′ u ∈ B ǫ ŵB, then we also have B ǫ ŵ′ B ⊆ B ǫ ŵB. By definition ŵ′ ≤++ ŵ
for ǫ = +, and ŵ′ ≥−+ ŵ for ǫ = −.
In part (c) of the proof of Theorem 2.3 we have seen that

                                gw1 Λw−1 Λ (uǫ n̂ŵ′ u) 6= 0
                                       2


implies Θ ⊇ Θ and there exists an element w ∈ W Θ′⊥ such that Θ (w−1 w2′ ) ≤ w2
                  ′

and
                     
                         ≤ (w1′ w)Θ for ǫ = +
                  w1                                .
                         ≥ (w1′ w)Θ for ǫ = −

Due to Theorem 2.3 itself, from this follows ŵ′ ≥++ ŵ for ǫ = +, and ŵ′ ≤−+ ŵ
for ǫ = −.
Due to the last theorem the relations ≤++ , ≤−+ are antisymmetric. Therefore
we get ŵ′ = ŵ.
To show the inclusion ’⊇’ of (16) let uǫ ∈ U ǫ , u ∈ U , and let n̂ŵ ∈ N  b belong to
     c     b
ŵ ∈ W = N /T . Write n̂ŵ in the form n̂ŵ = nw1 e(R(Θ))nw2 with nw1 , nw2 ∈ N
belonging to w1 , w2 ∈ W. We have
                                 DD                                     EE

The vertices of S(nw2 uvw−1 Λ ) are of the form w2 w̃Λ where w̃ ∈ W Θ and w̃ ≤
                               2
w2−1 . Furthermore Λ is a vertex.
Now we want to determine which verticees of this form are also verticees of
S(e(R(Θ))nw2 uvw−1 Λ ). Because of Λ is contained in the relative interior of

R(Θ) we find

     w2 w̃Λ ∈ R(Θ) ⇐⇒ w2 w̃R(Θ) ⊆ R(Θ) ⇐⇒ w2 w̃R(Θ) = R(Θ)
                     ⇐⇒ w2 w̃ ∈ W Θ∪Θ⊥ ⇐⇒ w̃ ∈ w2−1 W Θ∪Θ⊥

In this case we get w2−1 ≤ w̃ because w2−1 is a minimal coset representative of
W Θ∪Θ⊥ . Because of the antisymmetry of the Bruhat order of W this implies
w2−1 = w̃. Therefore Λ is the only vertex of S(e(R(Θ))nw2 uvw−1 Λ ) and we have
                                                                        2

2) By applying the Chevalley involution ∗ : G b on (16) for ǫ ∈ {+, −}, and
δ = + we find the equation

                B − (ŵ)inv B −ǫ ∩ DGb (g ∗ ) = B − (ŵ)inv B −ǫ ,

from which follow the remaining statements of the theorem by Remark (1)
following Proposition 2.2.
                                                                             
The next two theorems give product decompositions of B ŵB, B − ŵB − , and
              c as principal open sets in their closures. These generalize the
B − ŵB, ŵ ∈ W,
product decompositions of sets BwB = Uw ·wT ·U , and B − wB = (U w )− ·wT ·U ,
w ∈ W, given in [K,P 1] for Kac-Moody groups. The decomposition of B ŵB,
     c is nearly similar to the corresponding decomposition of a Bruhat cell of
ŵ ∈ W,
the wonderful compactification of a semisimple algebraic group in [Re 3].

2) Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 be an element of W c in normal form I or in normal

Remark: It is easy to see that

                 Uw1     = U ∩ w1 U − w1−1 = U ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 ,
                Uw−1     = U ∩ w2−1 U − w2 = U ∩ w2−1 (U Θ )− w2 .

In this sense the formulas of 1) are symmetric in the first and last factor.
Proof: We only have to show the statements of the theorem which involve
normal form I. Then the statements which involve normal form II follow by
                                      b → G,
applying the Chevalley involution ∗ : G   b together with the Remark (1)

Write n̂ in the form n̂ = n1 e(R(Θ))n2 with n1 , n2 ∈ N corresponding to w1 ∈

w2 Uw−1 w2−1 is generated by the root groups

                           ⊥
Since w2−1 ∈ W Θ∪Θ these root groups coincide with the root groups
                                                     	
    Uβ where β ∈ ∆−  re \ W Θ∪Θ⊥   αi | i ∈ (Θ ∪ Θ⊥ ) , w2−1 β ∈ ∆+re ,
                                           ⊥
which are contained in (U Θ∪Θ )− . By using formula (2) we find
                                                                  −1
                           B ŵB ⊆ Uw1 n1 e(R(Θ))T n2 U w2             ,

and the reverse inclusion is obvious. We have
                       −1
                    U w2        ⊆       w2−1 U w2 = w2−1 UΘ w2 ⋉ w2−1 U Θ w2 .
                                    ⊥
Because of w2−1 ∈ W Θ∪Θ , the group w2−1 UΘ w2 is contained in U . Clearly it is
                                                             −1
also contained in w2−1 U w2 . Therfore it is contained in U w2 .
An element x ∈ w2−1 U w2 can be written in the form x = p1 (x)p2 (x) with p1 (x) ∈
                                                        −1       −1
w2−1 UΘ w2 and p2 (x) ∈ w2−1 U Θ w2 . Obviously p2 (U w2 ) ⊇ U w2 ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 .
                                                    −1
The reverse inclusion follows because for x ∈ U w2 we have
                                                                       −1
                    w2−1 U Θ w2 ∋ p2 (x) = p1 (x)−1 x ∈ U w2                .

We get
        −1             −1
p2 (U w2 ) = U w2 ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 = U ∩ w2−1 U w2 ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 = U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 .

By using this equation and two times formula (β) we find
                                               −1                                     −1                 −1
B ŵB       = Uw1 n1 e(R(Θ))T n2 U w2               = Uw1 n1 e(R(Θ)) w2 p1 (U w2 )w2−1 T n2 p2 (U w2 )

2) By using the first equation of (δ) we get

                     w1 −
              = (U     ) n1 e(R(Θ))T n2 U .
The reverse inclusion is obvious. In the same way as before we get
          B − ŵB    =      (U w1 )− n1 e(R(Θ))T n2 (U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 )
                     =      (U w1 )− n1 e(R(Θ))n2 (w2−1 T Θ w2 )(U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 ) .
Treating the first factor in a similar way we find
B − ŵB       =   (U − ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 )n1 e(R(Θ))n2 (w2−1 T Θ w2 )(U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 )

                                                                                   
We equip B ǫ ŵB δ with its coordinate ring F [B ǫ ŵB δ ] as a principal open set in
                                                c
its closure, (ǫ, δ) ∈ {(++), (−−), (−+)}, ŵ ∈ W.
Recall that the torus T of the Kac-Moody group can be described by the fol-
lowing isomorphism of groups:

The group algebra F [P ] of the lattice
                                    P      P can be identified with the classical
coordinate ring on T , identifying    cλ eλ ∈ F [P ] with the function on T defined

Similarly, for J ⊆ I and w ∈ W, the classical coordinate ring of the torus
wT J w−1 , where

                  T J := {      thi (si ) | si ∈ F× } ,

is given by the group algebra F [wP J ], where
                  P J := Z-span { Λi | i = 1, . . . , 2n − l, i ∈

(In general the classical coordinate rings of these tori do not coincide with the
                                       b onto these tori. It is possible to show
restriction of the coordinate ring F [G]
         J −1
that wT w is principal open in its closure, and the classical coordinate ring
of wT J w−1 is the coordinate ring of this principal open set. But we do not need
this for the following considerations.)

Proof: We only have to show the statements of the theorem which involve
normal form I. Then the statements which involve normal form II follow easily
                                      b → G,
by using the Chevalley involution ∗ : G   b together with Remark (3) following
Definition 2.1 and Remark (1) following Proposition 2.2.
Due to the last theorem the maps m of 1a) and 2) are surjective. We show
that the corresponding comorphisms m∗ are well defined and surjective. This
is sufficient, because the surjectivity of the maps m imply the injectivity of
the comorphisms m∗ , and the surjectivity of the comorphisms m∗ imply the
injectivity of the maps m.

is well defined, write n̂ in the form n̂ = n1 e(R(Θ))n2 with n1 , n2 ∈ N corre-
                                   ⊥
sponding to w1 ∈ W Θ , w2 ∈ Θ∪Θ W.
Fix an element Λ ∈ FΘ , and fix v1 ∈ L(Λ)w1 Λ \ {0}, v2 ∈ L(Λ)w−1 Λ \ {0}. For
                                                                       2
u ∈ Uw1 , t ∈ w2−1 T Θ w2 , and ũ ∈ (U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 ) we have
fv1 v2 (m(u, t, ũ)) = hhv1 | un1 e(R(Θ))n2 tũv2 ii = hhu∗ v1 | n1 e(R(Θ))n2 tũv2 ii .
Because of ũ ∈ w2−1 U Θ w2 we get ũv2 = v2 . Because of
             u∗ ∈ Uw∗ 1 = (U ∩ w1 U − w1−1 )∗ = U − ∩ w1 U w1−1
we get uv1 = v1 . Therefore
fv1 v2 (m(u, t, ũ))   = hhv1 | n1 e(R(Θ))n2 tv2 ii = hhv1 | n1 e(R(Θ))n2 v2 ii ew−1 Λ (t)

Now let N ∈ P + and v, w ∈ L(N ). Choose hh | ii-dual bases of L(N ) by
choosing hh | ii-dual bases

of L(N )τ for every τ ∈ P (N ). For u ∈ Uw1 , t ∈ w2−1 T Θ w2 , and ũ ∈ (U ∩
w2−1 U Θ w2 ) we have

        fvw (m(u, t, ũ))    = hhv | un1 e(R(Θ))n2 tũwii

A summand of this sum is nonzero at the most if w 6= 0, and if τ is bigger
than an element of supp(w), which is only possible for finitely many non-zero
summands. Furthermore R(Θ) ∩ P = X ∩ P Θ . Taking into account (18) we
therefore get for p ∈ N0 :

Because F [G]
we have shown that the comorphism m∗ is well defined.
To show the surjectivity of m∗ , it is sufficient to find elements of F [B ŵB],
which are mapped onto a system of generators of F [Uw1 ] ⊗ F [w2−1 P Θ ] ⊗
F [U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 ].
a) Let v ∈ L(Λ). For u ∈ Uw1 , t ∈ w2−1 T Θ w2 , and ũ ∈ (U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 ) we have

hhv1 | un1 e(R(Θ))n2 tũvii = hhu∗ v1 | n1 e(R(Θ))n2 tũvii = hhv1 | n1 e(R(Θ))n2 tũvii
        = hhtn∗2 e(R(Θ))n∗1 v1 | ũvii = hhtn∗2 n∗1 v1 | ũvii = hhn∗2 n∗1 v1 | ũvii ew−1 Λ (t) .
                                                                                                 2


Taking into accout (18) we therefore get
                     
         fv1 v                     1
   m∗          |B ŵB   =                     1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ fn∗2 n∗1 v1 v |U∩w−1 U Θ w2 (. 20)
        fv1 v2             hhv1 | n1 n2 v2 ii                           2

                                          6=0

We have n∗1 v1 ∈ L(Λ)Λ \ {0}. Due to Theorem 5.6 of [M 1] the coordinate
ring F [U Θ ] is generated by the functions fn∗1 v1 v |U Θ , v ∈ L(Λ). Therefore its
restriction F [w2 U w2−1 ∩ U Θ ] is generated by

                      fn∗1 v1 n2 v |w2 Uw−1 ∩U Θ           ,       v ∈ L(Λ) .
                                          2



                                                   26
It is easy to check that we get an isomorphism

                         φ : U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 → w2 U w2−1 ∩ U Θ

by φ(u) := n2 un−1                     −1 Θ
                      2 . For u ∈ U ∩ w2 U w2 we have
                                       

 ∗                    
φ∗ (fn∗1 v1 n2 v |w2 Uw−1 ∩U Θ )(u) =    n1 v1 | n2 un2−1 n2 v    = hhn∗2 n∗1 v1 | uvii .
                     2


Therefore the functions

  φ∗ (fn∗1 v1 n2 v |w2 Uw−1 ∩U Θ ) = fn∗2 n∗1 v1 v |U∩w−1 U Θ w2     ,       v ∈ L(Λ) ,
                         2                              2


which appear in (20), generate the coordinate ring F [U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 ].
b) Let N ∈ FΘ ∩ P and ṽ1 ∈ L(N )w1 N \ {0}, ṽ2 ∈ L(N )w−1 N \ {0}. Let p ∈ N0 .
                                                                2
Similar to (18) we find
                               
         ∗    fṽ1 ṽ2               hhṽ1 | n1 n2 ṽ2 ii

                                    |        {z          }
                                                  6=0

It is easy to check that (FΘ ∩ P ) − N0 Λ = P Θ . Therefore the functions
ew−1 (N −mΛ) , N ∈ FΘ ∩ P , m ∈ N0 , span the coordinate ring F [w2−1 P Θ ].

c) Let v ∈ L(Λ). For u ∈ Uw1 , t ∈ w2−1 T Θ w2 , and ũ ∈ (U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 ) we have

hhv | un1 e(R(Θ))n2 tũv2 ii =         hhv | un1 e(R(Θ))n2 tv2 ii = hhv | un1 e(R(Θ))n2 v2 ii ew−1 Λ (t)

                                 =     hhv | un1 n2 v2 ii ew−1 Λ (t) .
                                                            2


Taking into account (18) we therefore get
                          
             fvv2                      1

                                               6=0

Uw1 = U ∩ w1 U − w1−1 is generated by the root groups Uα , α ∈ ∆+        −
                                                                re ∩ w1 ∆re .
            Θ             +        −     +        −
Since w1 ∈ W we have ∆re ∩ w1 ∆re = ∆re ∩ w1 (∆re \ W Θ Θ). This implies

               Uw1 = U ∩ w1 U − w1−1 ⊆ U ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 ,

and the reverse inclusion is obvious. We have n2 v2 ∈ L(Λ)Λ \ {0}. Due to
Theorem 5.6 of [M 1] the coordinate ring F [(U Θ )− ] is generated by the func-
tions fv n2 v2 |(U Θ )− , v ∈ L(Λ). Therefore its restriction F [w1−1 U w1 ∩ (U Θ )− ] is
generated by

                     fn∗1 v n2 v2 |w−1 Uw1 ∩(U Θ )−     ,       v ∈ L(Λ) .
                                  1


It is easy to check that we get an isomorphism

                   φ : U ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 → w1−1 U w1 ∩ (U Θ )−

                                                27
by φ(u) := n−1                                       Θ − −1
                  1 un1 . For u ∈ Uw1 = U ∩ w1 (U ) w1 we have
                                          

 ∗                    
φ∗ (fn∗1 v n2 v2 |w−1 Uw1 ∩(U Θ )− )(u) =   n1 v | n1−1 un1 n2 v2    = hhv | un1 n2 v2 ii
                1


Therefore the functions

    φ∗ (fn∗1 v n2 v2 |w−1 Uw1 ∩(U Θ )− ) = fv n1 n2 v2 |Uw1   ,     v ∈ L(Λ) ,
                     1


which appear in (22) generate the coordinate ring F [Uw1 ].
To 2): We use the same notations as in the first part of this proof. For u ∈
U − ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 we have u∗ ∈ w1 U Θ w1−1 . Therefore also u∗ v1 = v1 .
Completely parallel to the first part of this proof we get formula (19) with B ŵB
replaced by B − ŵB, and Uw1 replaced by U − ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 . In particular it
follows that the comorphism

m∗ : F [B − ŵB] → F [U − ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 ] ⊗ F [w2−1 P Θ ] ⊗ F [U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 ]

is well defined.
Also completely parallel to a) and b) of the first part of this proof we get
the formulas (20) and (21) with B ŵB replaced by B − ŵB. Therefore we have
found elements of F [B − ŵB], which are mapped onto a system of generators of
1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ F [U ∩ w2−1 U Θ w2 ], and 1 ⊗ F [w2−1 P Θ ] ⊗ 1.
Completely parallel to the proof of formula (22), we get formula (22) with B ŵB
replaced by B − ŵB, and Uw1 replaced by U − ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 . An easy modifi-
cation of the corresponding argument of a) of the first part of the proof shows
that the functions fv n1 n2 v2 |U − ∩w1 (U Θ )− w−1 , v ∈ L(Λ), generate the coordinate
                                                  1
ring F [U − ∩ w1 (U Θ )− w1−1 ].
                                                                            
Next we want to show that the orbits are irreducible. For this we first state
a theorem of [M 2]. Equip G  cf with a coordinate ring by identifying with the
                       c
coordinate ring of 1 ⋄ Gf ⊆ Specm F [G] b via the injective map Gcf → 1 ⋄ Gcf ,
                                              cf by M . To use later note that
x 7→ 1 ⋄ x. Denote the Zariski closure of M ⊆ G
due to Theorem 16 of [M 2] this closure coincides with the closure denoted by
M in [M 2]. Now Theorem 4 of [M 2] gives:
                                                                  b The
Theorem 2.8 Let D1 , D2 be irreducible subgroups of Gf , and x ∈ G.
D1 × D2 -orbit of the element 1 ⋄ x ∈ Specm F [G] is irreducible.
                               b
There is a similar theorem for G:
                                                                   b The
Theorem 2.9 Let D1 , D2 be irreducible subgroups of G, and let x ∈ G.
                ∗
D1 × D2 -orbit D1 xD2 is irreducible.
The proof of this theorem can be extracted from a part of the proof of Theorem
2.8. For the convenience of the reader we sketch the proof.
Proof: Let x ∈ G  b and Or := D∗ xD2 its D1 × D2 -orbit. Let A1 and A2 be
                                  1


                                             28
                   b such that Or ⊆ A1 ∪ A2 . We have to show Or ⊆ A1 or
closed subsets of G,
Or ⊆ A2 .
Let d1 ∈ D1 . The map γd1 : D2 → G b defined by γd1 (d2 ) := d∗ xd2 , d2 ∈ D2 , is
                                                              1
a morphism.
Similarly, for d2 ∈ D2 , the map δd2 : D1 → G b defined by δd2 (d1 ) := d∗ xd2 ,
                                                                           1
d1 ∈ D1 , is a morphism.
Let d1 ∈ D1 . Because of γd1 (D2 ) ⊆ Or, we have γd−11
                                                       (A1 ) ∪ γd−1
                                                                  1
                                                                    (A2 ) = D2 .
               −1           −1
Furthermore γd1 (A1 ) and γd1 (A2 ) are closed. Because of the irreducibility of
D2 we get γd−1
             1
               (A1 ) = D2 or γd−1
                                1
                                  (A2 ) = D2 .
Therefore the sets
                                                                  	
                     B1   :=       d1 ∈ D1 | γd−1

                                                  (A1 ) = D2           ,
                                                                  	
                     B2   :=       d1 ∈ D1 |   γd−1
                                                  1
                                                    (A2 )   = D2

satisfy B1 ∪ B2 = D1 .
Note that for d1 ∈ D1 and d2 ∈ D2 we have γd1 (d2 ) = δd2 (d1 ). The set B1 is
closed, because of
                                                             \
   B1 = { d1 ∈ D1 | γd1 (d2 ) ∈ A1 for all d2 ∈ D2 } =            δd−1 (A1 ) .
                                                           d2 ∈D2
                                                                  | 2 {z }
                                                                           closed

Similarly, the set B2 is closed. Because of the irreducibility of D1 we get B1 = D1
or B2 = D1 , which is equivalent to Or ⊆ A1 or Or ⊆ A2 .
                                                                                  


Proposition 2.10 B and B − are irreducible.
Proof: The Chevalley involution ∗ : G    b→G  b is an isomorphism, which maps B
onto B − . Therefore it is sufficient to show that B is irreducible.
Due to Corollary 2.5 we have DB (gΛΛ |B ) = B. Due to Theorem 2.7 the
multiplication map

                          m : U × T → DB (gΛΛ |B )

is an isomorphism. Here U is irreducible because its coordinate ring is a sym-
metric algebra, compare [K,P 2], Lemma 4.3. The torus T , which is equipped
with its classical coordinate ring, is irreducible. Therefore also the principal
open set DB (gΛΛ |B ) is irreducible, which implies that B is irreducible, which
implies that B is irreducible.
                                                                              
Combining the last proposition with Theorem 2.9 we get:
Corollary 2.11 The Bruhat and Birkhoff cells B ŵB, B − ŵB − , and B − ŵB are
                           c
irreducible for every ŵ ∈ W.


                                          29
At last we consider the Birkhoff cells of Specm F [G]. They have similar prop-
                                b
erties as the Birkhoff cells of G:
Theorem 2.12 Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 be an element of W       c in normal form I
or in normal form II, and let n̂ be a corresponding element of N b.
The closure of the Birkhoff cell Bf ⋄ ŵBf is given by
                              Spm          [
                    Bf ⋄ ŵBf       =            Bf ⋄ ŵ′ Bf .              (23)
                                              ŵ′ ∈W
                                                   c
                                            ŵ′ ≥−+ ŵ


The Birkhoff cell Bf ⋄ ŵBf is irreducible. It is principal open in its closure, i.e.,

             Bf ⋄ ŵBf ∩ DSpecm F [G]
                                   b (gw1 Λ w −1 Λ ) =           Bf ⋄ ŵBf .          (24)
                                                  2


Equip Bf ⋄ ŵBf with its coordinate ring as a principal open set in its closure.
Equip the torus w2−1 T Θ w2 with its classical coordinate ring. Then the map

 m : (Uf ∩ w1 UfΘ w1−1 ) × w2−1 T Θ w2 × (Uf ∩ w2−1 UfΘ w2 ) → Bf ⋄ ŵBf , (25)

defined by m(u, t, ũ) := u ⋄ n̂tũ, is an isomorphism.
Proof: We first show the equation (23): It is easy to adapt step (c), ǫ = −,
of the proof of Theorem 2.3 to show the inclusion ’⊆’. To show the reverse
                             b we have
inclusion, note that for M ⊆ G
                                                Spm
                             1 ⋄M ⊆ 1 ⋄M                 .
          c such that ŵ′ ≥−+ ŵ, then
Let ŵ′ ∈ W
                                                                  Spm                 Spm
B ⋄ ŵ′ B   =   1 ⋄ B − ŵ′ B ⊆ 1 ⋄ B − ŵB ⊆ 1 ⋄ B − ŵB               = B ⋄ ŵ′ B
                            Spm
            ⊆   Bf ⋄ ŵBf         .

Since Bf × Bf acts on Specm F [G] by morphisms, we find by applying Bf × Bf
to this inclusion:
                                                      Spm
                        Bf ⋄ ŵ′ Bf ⊆ Bf ⋄ ŵBf              .

It is easy to adapt the proof of Theorem 2.5 to show equation (24).
Because of Theorem 2.8, to show the irreducibility of Bf ŵBf , it is sufficient to
                                cf .
show the irreducibility of Bf ⊆ G
The relative topology on B induced by Gcf is the same as the relative topology
on B induced by G. b Due to Proposition 2.10 B is irreducible. Therefore it is
sufficient to show

                                      Bf   =    B .                                   (26)

Due to [M 2], Theorem 9 (1) we have U = Uf . Due to Proposition 1 of [M 2]
B is a monoid. Because T and U are contained in B we find Bf = T Uf ⊆ B,

                                           30
from which follows the inclusion ’⊆’ in (26). The reverse inclusion is obvious.
Due to Theorem 9 (2) of [M 2] we have U Θ = UfΘ . Therefore the coordinate
ring F [UfΘ ] is isomorphic to F [U Θ ] by the restriction map. Due to part (a) of
the proof of Theorem 21 in [M 2] we have e(R(Θ))(Uf )Θ = e(R(Θ)). Using
these results it is not difficult to adapt the proof of Theorem 2.6 and Theorem
2.7 to show that the map m in (25) is an isomorphism.
                                                                                



3    Extensions of the length function
We first define three extensions of the length function l : W → N0 of the Weyl
                               c → Z and l−+ : W
group to functions l++ , l−− : W                  c → N0 of the Weyl monoid
by using the normal forms of the elements of W. c The length function l++ is
similar to the length function of a Renner monoid given in [Re 2] up to additive
constants on the orbits given by the action of the product of the Weyl group
on the Renner monoid. The functions l++ , l−− are allowed to take positive and
negative values. It is not possible to make l++ , l−− positive on the W × W-
          c by adding constants, because in general these functions can take
orbits of W
arbitrary positive and negative values on such orbits.
Definition 3.1
                                            c in normal form I. Set
1a) Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 be an element of W
                       l++ (ŵ) :=    l(w1 ) − l(w2 ) ∈ Z .
                                           c in normal form II. Set
b) Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 be an element of W
                      l−− (ŵ)   := −l(w1 ) + l(w2 ) ∈ Z .
                                           c in normal form I or in normal
2) Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 be an element of W
form II. Set
                      l−+ (ŵ)   := l(w1 ) + l(w2 ) ∈ N0 .
Remarks:
(1) We have l++ (ŵ) = l−− (ŵinv ), and l−+ (ŵ) = l−+ (ŵinv ).
(2) If ŵ = w1 w2 ε (R(Θ))w3 = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 w3 is an element of Wc in normal
form III, then
                    l++ (ŵ) =       l(w1 ) + l(w2 ) − l(w3 ) ,
                    l−− (ŵ) =     −l(w1 ) + l(w2 ) + l(w3 ) ,
                    l−+ (ŵ) =      l(w1 ) + l(w2 ) + l(w3 ) .
The length function l : W → N0 is compatible with the Bruhat order on W and
the natural order on N0 . Similar things hold for the the extensions of the length
function restricted to the W × W-orbits of W:c


                                        31
Proposition 3.2 Let Θ be special, and ŵ, ŵ′ ∈ Wε (R(Θ))W. Equip Wε (R(Θ))W
with the restriction of the extended Bruhat order ≤ǫδ , (ǫδ) ∈ {(++), (−−), (−+)}.
a) Then ŵ ǫδ ŵ′ implies lǫδ (ŵ)  lǫδ (ŵ′ ).
b) The length of every chain joining ŵ and ŵ′ is finite, and does not extend
lǫδ (ŵ′ ) − lǫδ (ŵ). In particular there exists a maximal chain joining ŵ and ŵ′ .
Proof: b) follows immediately from a). We only have to prove the cases
(++), (−+) of a). Then the case (−−) follows from the case (++) by using
                    c → W,
the inverse map inv W    c combining Remark (3) following Definition 2.1
and Remark (1) following Definition 3.1.
Recall that for elements u, v ∈ W we have
                    | l(u) − l(v)| ≤ l(uv) ≤ l(u) + l(v) ,                       (27)
and for J ⊆ I, uJ ∈ W J , J u ∈ J W we have
                          l(uJ J u) = l(uJ ) + l(J u) .                          (28)
Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 , ŵ′ = w1′ ε (R(Θ))w2′ be in normal form I, i.e., w1 , w1′ ∈
                      ⊥
W Θ and w2 , w2′ ∈ Θ∪Θ W.
               ′
a) If ŵ ++ ŵ then due to Theorem 2.3 there exist an element w ∈ W Θ⊥ , such
that
         w1 ≤ (w1′ w)Θ = w1′ w      and     w2 ≥ Θ (w−1 w2′ ) = w−1 w2′ .
Furthermore we have w1 6= w1′ w or w2 6= w−1 w2′ because otherwise we get by
using formula (3):
ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 = w1′ wε (R(Θ))w−1 w2′ = w1′ ε (R(Θ))w2′ = ŵ′ .
Now l : (W, ≤) → (N0 , ≤) is an order morphism. By using equation (28) and
inequality (27) we get
l++ (ŵ) = l(w1 ) − l(w2 )  l(w1′ w) − l(w−1 w2′ ) = l(w1′ w) − l(w−1 ) − l(w2′ )
         ≤ l(w1′ ww−1 ) − l(w2′ ) = l++ (ŵ′ ) .
b) If ŵ −+ ŵ′ then due to Theorem 2.3 there exist an element w ∈ W Θ⊥ , such
that
         w1′ ≥ (w1 w)Θ = w1 w       and     w2′ ≥ Θ (w−1 w2 ) = w−1 w2 .
Furthermore we have w1′ 6= w1 w or w2′ 6= w−1 w2 because otherwise
ŵ′ = w1′ ε (R(Θ))w2′ = w1 wε (R(Θ))w−1 w2 = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 = ŵ .
By using that l : (W, ≤) → (N0 , ≤) is an order morphism, by using equation
(28) and inequality (27) we get
l−+ (ŵ′ ) =    l(w1′ ) + l(w2′ ) 	 l(w1 w) + l(w−1 w2 ) = l(w1 w) + l(w−1 ) + l(w2′ )
           ≥    l(w1 ww−1 ) + l(w2 ) = l−+ (ŵ) .

For a reductive algebraic monoid the length of any maximal chain of the Bruhat-
Chevalley order, which joins two elements in an orbit of the action of the prod-
uct of the Weyl group on the Renner monoid, is given by the difference of the
length functions of these elements. This follows from the definition of the length
function in [Re 2], the algebraic description of the Bruhat Chevalley order in
[Pe,Pu,Re], and the Theorem in Section 7 of [Re 1], which states that if an ele-
ment covers another then the dimension difference of the corresponding Bruhat
cells is one. The algebraic geometric proof of this theorem can not be general-
ized to the Kac-Moody setting.
A combinatorial proof working for a Renner monoid and the Weyl monoid is
not easy to find, although some particular cases are not difficult to treat. In a
separate article this will be investigated further.
For an element w ∈ W and i ∈ I the length      of σi w and w, and the length of
wσi and w are related in the following way:

The next theorem gives the generalization for the extended length functions.

In all three cases the extended lengths of σi ŵ and ŵ are equal if and only if the

In all three cases the extended lengths of ŵσi and ŵ are equal if and only if the
elements ŵσi and ŵ are equal.
Proof: We only have to show the statements 2) of the theorem, which involve
normal form II. Then the statements 1), which involve normal form I, follow
easily by using Remark (1) following Definition 3.1 and Remark (1) following
Proposition 2.2. We make use of the formulas (3) and (4) without further
mentioning.
                                                                  ⊥
Let ŵ = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 be in normal form II, i.e., w1 ∈ W Θ∪Θ , w2 ∈ Θ W. Let
                                  ⊥
w2 = bc with b ∈ W Θ⊥ and c ∈ Θ∪Θ W.
a) We have:

        ŵσi = ŵ   ⇐⇒        ε (R(Θ))w2 σi w2−1 = ε (R(Θ))
                    ⇐⇒        σw2 αi = w2 σi w2−1 ∈ W Θ   ⇐⇒ w2 αi ∈ W Θ Θ

b) Let w2 αi ∈ W Θ⊥ Θ⊥ , which is equivalent to cαi ∈ W Θ⊥ Θ⊥ . Then

 ŵσi = w1 bε (R(Θ))cσi = w1 bε (R(Θ))σcαi c = w1 bσcαi ε (R(Θ))c .

                                                      P III with bσcαi as middle
Note that the expression on the right is in normal form
part. Now cαi can be written in the form cαi =         j∈Θ nj αj with either all
                                     −1
nj ∈ N0 or all nj ∈ −N0 . Applying c we get
                                     X
                            αi =          nj c−1 αj .
                                           j∈Θ

                          ⊥
Because of c−1 ∈ W Θ∪Θ we have c−1 αj ∈ ∆+    re ⊆ N0 -span{α1 , . . . , αn } for all
j ∈ Θ. This implies that there exists an index j ∈ Θ such that αi = c−1 αj . In
particular cαi is a simple root. By using Remark (2) following Definition 3.1
and equation (30) we find

    l++ (ŵσi ) − l++ (ŵ) = l−− (ŵσi ) − l−− (ŵ) = l−+ (ŵσi ) − l−+ (ŵ)

We first show cσi ∈ Θ∪Θ W: Because of c−1 ∈ W Θ∪Θ we have

                    c−1 αj ∈ ∆+
                              re      for all    j ∈ Θ ∪ Θ⊥ .

                                            34
Due to our assumption on cαi , from this follows

   c−1 αj ∈ ∆+             +
             re \ {αi } ⊆ ∆re \ {αi } ∪ {−αi }             for all       j ∈ Θ ∪ Θ⊥ .

Applying σi we get

                     σi c−1 αj ∈ ∆+
                                  re      for all   j ∈ Θ ∪ Θ⊥ ,

which implies σi c−1 ∈ W Θ∪Θ , or equivalent cσi ∈ Θ∪Θ W.
Now ŵσi = w1 ε (R(Θ))bcσi is in normal form III with cσi as last part. By using
Remark (2) following Definition 3.1 and equation (30) we find

  l++ (ŵσi ) − l++ (ŵ) = −l−− (ŵσi ) + l−− (ŵ) = −l−+ (ŵσi ) + l−+ (ŵ)

Here cαi ∈ ∆re ± \ W Θ∪Θ⊥ (Θ ∪ Θ⊥ ) is equivalent to w2 αi = bcαi ∈ ∆re ± \
W Θ∪Θ⊥ (Θ ∪ Θ⊥ ).
Putting together the cases a), b), and c) part 2) of the theorem follows.
                                                                              

Since w1 ∈ W Θ∪Θ we have w1 w2 αi ∈ (∆re )± if w2 αi ∈ W Θ⊥ Θ⊥ ∩ (∆re )± . We
conclude:
                                                              ⊥
                                                                           ⊥ +

        = w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 σi (σi−1 Ui σi )U i T ⊆ w1 ε (R(Θ))w2 σi (Ui ∪ Ui σi Ui )U i T
        = ŵσi B ∪ w1 ε (R(Θ))Uw2 σi αi w2 B

                                                              re \ W Θ∪Θ⊥ (Θ ∪ Θ )
        = ŵσi B ∪                                                  ⊥

        = ŵσi B ∪                                        ⊥                 .
                      U−w1 w2 αi ŵB f or w2 αi ∈ W Θ⊥ Θ


Here −w1 w2 αi ∈ (∆re )∓ if w2 αi ∈ W Θ⊥ Θ⊥ ∩ (∆re )± . Note also that σi−1 Ui σi
contains elements of Ui and Ui σi Ui . We conclude:
                                                                       ⊥

                                                    re \ W Θ∪Θ⊥ (Θ ∪ Θ ) ∪ (W Θ⊥ Θ ∩ ∆re ) .
B − ŵBσi B   =   B − ŵσi B ∪ B − ŵB   for    w2 αi ∈ ∆+

Due to Part 2) of the last theorem, from a)     and b) follows:
                    
                     B ŵB                if    l++ (ŵσi ) = l++ (ŵ)
    B ŵBσi B =         B ŵσi B           if    l++ (ŵσi ) = l++ (ŵ) + 1   .
                    
                        B ŵσi B ∪˙ B ŵB if     l++ (ŵσi ) = l++ (ŵ) − 1
                     −
                     B ŵB                     if   l−− (ŵσi ) = l−− (ŵ)
  B − ŵBσi B =         B − ŵσi B              if   l−− (ŵσi ) = l−− (ŵ) − 1   .
                     −
                        B ŵσi B ∪˙ B − ŵB     if   l−− (ŵσi ) = l−− (ŵ) + 1

The remaining cases of the theorem follow by applying the Chevalley involution
∗:G b → G,
         b together with Remark (3) following Definition 2.1 and Remark (1)
following Definition 3.1.
