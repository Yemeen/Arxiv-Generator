                                             Let L be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field k of characteristic zero and
                                             let U(L) be its enveloping algebra with quotient division ring D(L). Let P be a
                                             commutative Lie subalgebra of L. In [O2] the necessary and sufficient condition on
                                             P was given in order for D(P ) to be a maximal (commutative) subfield of D(L).
                                             In particular, this condition is satisfied if P is a commutative polarization (CP)
                                             with respect to any regular f ∈ L∗ and the converse holds if L is ad-algebraic.
                                             The purpose of this paper is to study Lie algebras admitting these CP’s and to
                                             demonstrate their widespread occurrence.
                                             First we have the following characterisation if L is completely solvable: P is a CP
                                             of L if and only if there exists a descending chain of Lie subalgebras

                                                                  L = Ln ⊃ . . . ⊃ Lj+1 ⊃ Lj ⊃ . . . ⊃ Lp = P

                                             such that dim Lj = j with increasing index, i.e. i(Lj ) = i(Lj+1 ) + 1, j :
                                             p, . . . , n − 1 (Theorem 1.11). In low dimension this phenomenon appears frequently.
                                             In fact, in a case by case study of indecomposable nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension
                                             at most seven we discover that Lie algebras without CP’s are rather exceptional: 1
                                             (out of 9) in dimension at most 5; 3 (out of 22) in dimension 6 and 26 (out of 130) in
                                             dimension 7. These will be listed in section 3, in which we also prove that nonabelian
                                               1
                                                   Partially supported by the CRDF grant RM1-2088




                                                                                          1
Lie algebras having a nondegenerate, invariant bilinear form do not admit any CP
(Theorem 3.2).

Suppose k is algebraically closed. Then for a Lie algebra L to admit a CP P has
the following advantage: in U(L) the primitive ideals I(f ), with regular f ∈ L∗ ,
can all be constructed using the same polarization P , since I(f ) is the kernel of the
(twisted) induced representation σ = ind∼ (f |P , L) [D, 10.3.4]. If in addition P is
an ideal of L (a so called CP-ideal of L) then the representation σ is irreducible (in
the completely solvable case P even turns out to be a Vergne polarization). Also,
the semi-center Sz(U(L)) of U(L) is contained in U(P ) (Corollary 4.4). Moreover,
a standard technique using Grassmannians shows that if L is solvable with a CP,
then it also has a CP-ideal (Theorem 4.1).

In section 5, we look for CP-ideals in some Frobenius Lie algebras (i.e. Lie algebras
of index zero [O1]). For instance, let x ∈ L be a principal nilpotent element of
a semi-simple Lie algebra L with centralizer P . Then the normalizer F of P is a
Frobenius Lie algebra by a recent result of Panyushev [P2], in which P is a CP-ideal
(Theorem 5.7). Next, let A be a finite dimensional associative algebra over k with
a unit. A becomes a Lie algebra g for the Lie bracket [a, b] = ab − ba, a, b ∈ A
and V = A becomes a g-module by left multiplication. Consider the semi-direct
product L = g ⊕ V . Then the following are equivalent (Proposition 5.6):

 (1) A is a Frobenius algebra

 (2) L is a Frobenius Lie algebra

 (3) V is a CP-ideal of L

 (4) D(V ) is a maximal subfield of D(L).

A similar result can be obtained if A is a finite dimensional left symmetric alge-
bra (Example 5.4) or if A is a finite dimensional simple Novikov algebra over k,
char(k) = p > 2.

CP-ideals also occur naturally in the nilradical N of any parabolic Lie subalgebra of
a simple Lie algebra L of type Ar or Cr . As a bonus we obtain an explicit formula
for the index i(N) of N (Theorem 6.2).
Finally, section 7 deals with some CP-preserving extensions.

              1. PRELIMINARIES AND GENERAL RESULTS

Let L be a Lie algebra over a field k of characteristic zero with basis x1 , . . . , xn .
Let f ∈ L∗ and consider the alternating bilinear form Bf on L sending (x, y)
into f ([x, y]). For any subset A of L we denote by A⊥ or Af the subspace

                      {x ∈ L | f ([x, a]) = 0 for all a ∈ A}

We also put    L(f ) = L⊥      and   i(L) = min∗ dim L(f ), the index of L. Note that
                                             f ∈L
L(f ) is a Lie subalgebra of L containing the center Z(L) of L. We recall from [D,
1.14.13] that

                         i(L) = dim L − rankR(L) ([xi , xj ])

where R(L) is the quotient field of the symmetric algebra S(L) of L. In particular,
dim L − i(L) is an even number.
Furthermore, f is called regular if dim L(f ) = i(L). It is well- known that the
set L∗reg of all regular elements of L∗ is an open dense subset of L∗ for the Zariski
topology.

DEFINITION 1.1 [D, 1.12.7] A Lie subalgebra P of L is called a polarization
w.r.t. f ∈ L∗ if f ([P, P ]) = 0 and dim P = 12 (dim L + dim L(f )), in other
words P is a maximal totally isotropic subspace of L (equipped with Bf ). If in
addition P is commutative then f is regular by the following observation.

LEMMA 1.2 (see Theorem 14 of [O2]). Let P be a commutative Lie subalgebra
of L; h1 , . . . , hm a basis of P and x1 , . . . , xn a basis of L. Then the following
conditions are equivalent:

 (a) dim P = 21 (dim L + i(L)),      i.e. P is a CP (commutative polarization) of L
     w.r.t. each f ∈ L∗reg .

 (b) P = P f     w.r.t. some    f ∈ L∗    (such an f is necessarily regular)

 (c) rankR(L) ([hi , xj ]) = dim L − dim P

LEMMA 1.3 Let P and M be Lie subalgebras of L such that                   P ⊂ M ⊂ L.
Then the following conditions are equivalent:

 (1) P is a CP of L



                                             3
 (2) P is a CP of M and          i(M) = i(L) + dim L − dim M.

Under these conditions the following hold:

                             f ∈ L∗reg             ∗
                                         ⇒ f |M ∈ Mreg

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Take any          f ∈ L∗reg . Then           P = P f . Put   g = f |M ∈ M ∗ .
W.r.t. Bg we have:

             P g = {x ∈ M | g([x, P ]) = 0} = {x ∈ M | f ([x, P ]) = 0}
                  = M ∩ P f = M ∩ P = P.

                                      ∗
Hence P is a CP of M and         g ∈ Mreg by Lemma 1.2. In particular,

                  1
                  2
                    (dim M   + i(M)) = dim P = 21 (dim L + i(L))

Consequently, i(M) = i(L) + dim L − dim M.
(2) ⇒ (1). P is commutative and

                                  1
                   dim P =        2
                                    (dim M + i(M))
                                  1
                             =    2
                                    (dim M + i(L) +        dim L − dim M)
                                  1
                             =    2
                                    (dim L + i(L))

Hence, P is a CP of L.

The following is a direct application of [D, Lemma 1.12.2].

LEMMA 1.4. Let M be a Lie subalgebra of L of codimension one. Let                       f ∈ L∗
and put g = f |M ∈ M ∗ . Then we distinguish two cases:

  (i) If   L(f ) ⊂ M    then L(f ) is a hyperplane in M(g).

 (ii) If   L(f ) 6⊂ M   then     M(g) = L(f ) ∩ M is a hyperplane in L(f ).


REMARK 1.5. In [O2] we introduced the notion of the Frobenius semiradical
F (L) of a Lie algebra L, namely
                                             X
                                  F (L) =              L(f )
                                            f ∈L∗reg




                                               4
This is a characteristic ideal of L containing the center Z(L) of L. It seems to play
a natural role in the study of commutative polarizations. For instance if L admits
a CP P , then F (L) ⊂ P and hence is commutative [O2, p.710].

PROPOSITION 1.6.      Let M be a Lie subalgebra of L of codimension one,
f ∈ L and g = f |M ∈ M ∗ . Then we have:
     ∗


 (1) either   i(M) = i(L) + 1    or      i(M) = i(L) − 1
                                 
      f ∈ L∗reg                          ∗
                                    g ∈ Mreg
 (2)                         ⇔
      i(M) = i(L) + 1             L(f ) ⊂ M
                                
      f ∈ L∗reg                       ∗
                                   g ∈ Mreg
 (3)                  ⇔
      L(f ) 6⊂ M                 i(M) = i(L) − 1

 (4) i(M) = i(L) + 1 ⇔ F (L) ⊂ M

 (5) Suppose    i(M) = i(L) + 1       and let P be a Lie subalgebra of M. Then

                       P is a CP of L ⇔ P is a CP of M

 (6) Suppose i(M) = i(L)−1. If H is a CP (respectively a CP- ideal) of L, then
     H ∩ M is a CP (resp. a CP-ideal) of M and dim(H ∩ M) = dim H − 1.

Proof.

 (1) Choose    ϕ ∈ L∗reg     such that                ∗
                                           γ = ϕ|M ∈ Mreg .   Suppose    L(ϕ) ⊂ M
     then

                    i(M) = dim M(γ) = dim L(ϕ) + 1 = i(L) + 1

     by (i) of Lemma 1.4. On the other hand, if       L(ϕ) 6⊂ M   then

                    i(M) = dim M(γ) = dim L(ϕ) − 1 = i(L) − 1

     by (ii) of Lemma 1.4.

 (2) ⇒:
     Suppose L(f ) 6⊂ M. By (ii) of Lemma 1.4

                    i(M) ≤ dim M(g) = dim L(f ) − 1 = i(L) − 1




                                            5
    Contradiction. Therefore        L(f ) ⊂ M.     Hence,

                    i(M) − 1 = i(L) = dim L(f ) = dim M(g) − 1

                                                                          ∗
    by (i) of Lemma 1.4. Hence i(M) = dim M(g),              i.e.    g ∈ Mreg .
    ⇐:
    By (i) of Lemma 1.4 L(f ) ⊂ M implies that

                    i(L) ≤ dim L(f ) = dim M(g) − 1 = i(M) − 1

    So, i(M) ≥ i(L) + 1.          By (1), i(M) = i(L) + 1       and therefore
    i(L) = dim L(f ), i.e.        f ∈ L∗reg .

(3) ⇒:
    L(f ) 6⊂ M     implies that

                    i(M) ≤ dim M(g) = dim L(f ) − 1 = i(L) − 1

    by (ii) of Lemma 1.4. Hence, by (1), i(M) = i(L) − 1 which forces
                                   ∗
    i(M) = dim M(g), i.e. g ∈ Mreg   .
    ⇐:
    Since i(M) 6= i(L) + 1 it follows from (2) that L(f ) 6⊂ M. Hence,

                    i(L) − 1 = i(M) = dim M(g) = dim L(f ) − 1

    by (ii) of Lemma 1.4. Consequently,          dim L(f ) = i(L),    i.e.   f ∈ L∗reg .

(4) ⇒ follows from (2).
    ⇐ Choose f ∈ L∗reg such that g = f |M ∈ Mreg ∗
                                                   . Then
    L(f ) ⊂ F (L) ⊂ M. Using (2) it follows that i(M) = i(L) + 1.

(5) Clearly,     i(M) = i(L) + dim L − dim M. Now use Lemma 1.3.

(6) Suppose i(M) = i(L) − 1. Hence, by Lemma 1.3 H 6⊂ M.                      Then
    dim(H ∩ M) = dim H − 1. H ∩ M is abelian and

               dim(H ∩ M) = 21 (dim L + i(L)) − 1 = 21 (dim M + i(M))

    Consequently,     H ∩ M is a CP (resp. a CP-ideal) of M.

EXAMPLES 1.7.

 (1) Let E be a nonzero endomorphism of an n-dimensional vector space V over k.
     Consider the Lie algebra L = kE ⊕ V with Lie brackets [E, v] = Ev and
     in which V is a commutative ideal. L is solvable and i(L) = n − 1. Clearly,
     i(V ) = n = i(L) + 1 and V is a CP-ideal of L by (5) of Proposition 1.6.

 (2) Let L be a Frobenius Lie algebra (i.e. i(L) = 0) and M a Lie subalgebra of
     L of codimension one. Then i(M) = 1 (= i(L) + 1).

 (3) Let M be a Lie subalgebra of codimension one in a nonabelian Lie algebra L
     with F (L) = L. Then, i(M) = i(L) − 1 and L does not have any CP’s
     (by Proposition 1.6 and Remark 1.5). For instance, let L be the diamond Lie
     algebra with basis t, x, y, z and nonvanishing brackets [t, x] = −x [t, y] =
     y and [x, y] = z. Clearly, i(L) = 2 and M = [L, L] = hx, y, zi is
     an ideal of codimension one in L with i(M) = 1. Put f = x∗ ∈ L∗reg
     and g = f |M ∈ M ∗ . Then, L(f ) = hy, zi ⊂ M, i(M) = i(L) − 1 and
            ∗
     g∈/ Mreg . Also, P1 = hy, zi is a CP of M. But there is no CP P of L
     such that P ∩M = P1 (in fact L does not admit any CP since F (L) = L).
     See also Theorem 3.2 and (2) of Examples 3.3.


DEFINITION 1.8 A Lie algebra L is called square integrable if L(f ) = Z(L)
for some f ∈ L∗ , i.e. i(L) = dim Z(L).
In the nilpotent case these Lie algebras are precisely the Lie algebras of simply
connected Lie groups admitting square integrable representations [MW, p.450-453].

PROPOSITION 1.9 Let L be a Lie algebra having an element u ∈ L such that
its centralizer M = C(u) has codimension one in L. Then we have

  (i) i(M) = i(L) + 1

 (ii) L has a CP if and only if M has a CP

(iii) If L is square integrable then so is M.


REMARK 1.10. Note that C(u) is an ideal of codimension one of L if either
u is a noncentral semi-invariant of L (i.e. for a suitable λ ∈ L∗ \{0} : [x, u] =
λ(x)u, x ∈ L) or [u, L] is a one dimensional subspace of the center Z(L) (such



                                          7
an u always exists if L is nilpotent and dim Z(L) = 1 < dim L). In that situation,
if L has a CP-ideal then the same holds for C(u).



Proof of the proposition.

  (i) Take x ∈ L\C(u) and choose f ∈ L∗ such that f |M is regular and
      such that f ([x, u]) 6= 0. Then C(u) = uf (since both have the same
      dimension and C(u) ⊂ uf ). Then L(f ) = Lf ⊂ uf = M. It follows by
      (2) of Proposition 1.6 that i(M) = i(L) + 1 and f ∈ L∗reg .

 (ii) First, let P be a commutative Lie subalgebra of M. Then,

                      P is a CP of L if and only if P is a CP of M

     by (5) of Proposition 1.6. Next, let P be a CP of L such that P 6⊂ M. Then
     dim(P ∩ M) = dim P − 1 and u ∈         / P ∩ M (otherwise [u, P ] = 0 and
     thus P ⊂ C(u) = M).
     Finally, P1 = (P ∩ M) ⊕ ku is a CP of M since it is commutative and

               dim P1 = dim P = 21 (dim L + i(L)) = 21 (dim M + i(M))

(iii) Clearly, Z(L) ⊂ C(u) = M and           u ∈ Z(M)\Z(L). Hence,
      Z(L) ⊕ ku ⊂ Z(M). Therefore,

                    i(M) ≥ dim Z(M) ≥ dim Z(L) + 1 = i(L) + 1

     As i(M) = i(L) + 1      we may conclude that    i(M) = dim Z(M),      i.e. M is
     square integrable.


THEOREM 1.11 Let P be a commutative Lie subalgebra of a completely sol-
vable Lie algebra L. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

 (1) P is a CP (resp. CP-ideal) of L.

 (2) There exists a descending series of Lie subalgebras (resp. ideals) of L.


                  L = Ln ⊃ . . . ⊃ Lj+1 ⊃ Lj ⊃ . . . ⊃ Lp = P




                                         8
dim Lj = j,   with increasing index (i.e.       i(Lj ) = i(Lj+1 ) + 1).

Proof. Let P be a Lie subalgebra (resp. ideal) of L. P (resp. L) acts on the
quotient space L/P . Application of Lie’s theorem to this action shows the exis-
tence of Lie subalgebras (resp. ideals) Lj of L such that L = Ln ⊃ . . . ⊃ Lp = P
with dim Lj = j.
(1) ⇒ (2). Now suppose P is a CP of L.
Then, by Lemma 1.3, P is also a CP for each Lj and

                i(Lj ) = i(L) + (n − j) = i(L) + (n − (j + 1)) + 1
                       = i(Lj+1 ) + 1

(2) ⇒ (1)
By induction on j we show that P is a CP of Lj . This is trivial for j = p. Next,
let j ≥ p + 1. Then P is a CP of Lj−1 and also of Lj since i(Lj−1 ) = i(Lj ) + 1
by (5) of Proposition 1.6.

COROLLARY 1.12. Let L be a completely solvable Frobenius Lie algebra of
dimension 2n having a CP P . Then L can be obtained from the n- dimensional
abelian Lie algebra P with n successive extensions as described in Theorem 1.10.

LEMMA 1.13. Let P be a CP (resp. a CP-ideal) of a Lie algebra L, A an ideal
of L contained in P and f ∈ L∗reg such that f (A) = 0. Then P/A is a CP
(resp. a CP-ideal) of the Lie algebra L/A and

                            i(L/A) = i(L) − dim A

Proof. Let ϕ : L → L/A be the quotient homomorphism. As f (A) = 0
there is a g ∈ (L/A)∗ such that g ◦ ϕ = f . Clearly, P/A is an abelian Lie
subalgebra (resp. ideal) of L/A. It suffices to show that (P/A)g = P/A.

              (P/A)g = {ϕ(x) ∈ L/A | g([ϕ(x), ϕ(P )]) = 0, x ∈ L}
                       = ϕ({x ∈ L | f ([x, P ]) = 0}
                       = ϕ(P f ) = ϕ(P ) = P/A

as P f = P . So, by Lemma 1.2 P/A is a CP (resp. CP-ideal) of             L/A   and
g ∈ (L/A)∗reg . Therefore, dim P/A = 21 (dim L/A + i(L/A)) and

              i(L/A) = 2 dim P/A − dim L/A



                                            9
                       = 2(dim P − dim A) − (dim L − dim A)
                       = (2 dim P − dim L) − dim A = i(L) − dim A




 2. CP’S IN SQUARE INTEGRABLE NILPOTENT LIE ALGEBRAS

The following lemma is easy to verify.

LEMMA 2.1. Suppose L is a direct product of Lie algebras;             L = L1 × L2 .
Then we have the following:
 (1) i(L) = i(L1 ) + i(L2 )   and   Z(L) = Z(L1 ) × Z(L2 ).

 (2) L is square integrable if and only if the same holds for L1 and L2 .

 (3) L has a CP (resp. CP-ideal) if and only if the same holds for L1 and L2 .


PROPOSITION 2.2. Let L be a square integrable nilpotent Lie algebra over
C,
I of dimension n at most seven. Then L admits a CP-ideal.

Proof. By Lemma 2.1 we may assume that L is indecomposable. In particular,
1 ≤ dim Z(L) = i(L) < dim L.

We now distinguish the following cases:
 (1) i(L) = 1. Then n is 3, 5 or 7. Let m be the maximum dimension of all
     abelian ideals of L. Then by [Mo, p.161] and [O2, p.706] we have the following
     inequalities:
                 1 √                    1                  1
                   ( 8n + 1 − 1) ≤ m ≤ (dim L + i(L)) = (n + 1)
                 2                      2                  2
     This implies that m = 21 (dim L + i(L))      in case n = 3, 5 or 7, showing the
     existence of a CP-ideal in L.

 (2) i(L) = 2.     Then n = 6 (The case n = 4 does not occur since L
     is indecomposable). We select from Morozov’s classification of 6-dimensional
     nilpotent Lie algebras those that are indecomposable, square integrable and of
     index 2; in each {e1 , . . . , e6 } is a basis of L. The numbering is Morozov’s
     [Mo, p.168].



                                          10
        4. [e1 , e2 ] = e5 ,   [e1 , e3 ] = e6 ,   [e2 , e4 ] = e6
        5. [e1 , e3 ] = e5 ,   [e1 , e4 ] = e6 ,   [e2 , e4 ] = e5     [e2 , e3 ] = γe6 ,    γ 6= 0
        6. [e1 , e2 ] = e6 ,   [e1 , e3 ] = e4 ,   [e1 , e4 ] = e5 ,   [e2 , e3 ] = e5
        7. [e1 , e3 ] = e4 ,   [e1 , e4 ] = e5 ,   [e2 , e3 ] = e6
        8. [e1 , e2 ] = e3 + e5 ,    [e1 , e3 ] = e4 ,   [e2 , e5 ] = e6
        9. [e1 , e2 ] = e3 ,   [e1 , e3 ] = e4 ,   [e1 , e5 ] = e6 ,   [e2 , e3 ] = e6
       10. [e1 , e2 ] = e3 ,   [e1 , e3 ] = e5 ,   [e1 , e4 ] = e6 ,     [e2 , e4 ] = e5 ,   [e2 , e3 ] = γe6 ,
           γ 6= 0
       11. [e1 , e2 ] = e3 ,   [e1 , e3 ] = e4 ,   [e1 , e4 ] = e5 ,   [e2 , e3 ] = e6

      In each one of these, P = he3 , e4 , e5 , e6 i is a CP- ideal, since P is an abelian
      ideal and dim P = 4 = 21 (dim L + i(L)).

 (3) i(L) = 3.         Then n = 7 (The case n = 5 does not occur since L is
     indecomposable).
     We have the following possibilities according to Seeley’s classification of 7-
     dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras. We maintain the same notation as in
     [See]. In particular {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} is a basis of L. In each case we exhibit
     a commutative ideal P of dimension 5 (= 21 (dim L + i(L))).
     In the following 3 Lie algebras we take P = ha, d, e, f, gi
     3 7B : [a, b] = e, [b, c] = f , [c, d] = g
     3 7C : [a, b] = e, [b, c] = f , [c, d] = e, [b, d] = g
     3 7D : [a, b] = e, [b, d] = g, [c, d] = e, [a, c] = f
     In the following 3 we take P = hc, d, e, f, gi
     3, 5, 7A : [a, b] = c, [a, c] = e, [a, d] = g, [b, d] = f
     3, 5, 7B : [a, b] = c, [a, c] = e, [a, d] = g, [b, c] = f
     3, 5, 7C : [a, b] = c, [a, c] = e, [a, d] = g, [b, c] = f , [b, d] = e


REMARK 2.3 Among the Lie algebras described in Proposition 2.2 there is one
which is characteristically nilpotent, namely 1, 2, 4, 5, 7N with basis {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}
and nonzero brackets: [a, b] = c, [a, c] = d, [a, d] = g, [a, e] = f , [a, f ] = g,
[b, c] = e, [b, d] = f , [b, e] = ξg, [b, f ] = g, [c, d] = g, [c, e] = −g with
ξ 6= 0, 1. [See, p.493]. In this case take P = hd, e, f, gi.




                                                    11
                      3. LIE ALGEBRAS WITHOUT CP’S

First we want to show that the restriction on the dimension in Proposition 2.2 cannot
be removed.

EXAMPLES 3.1

  (i) Let L be the 8-dimensional Lie algebra over k with basis {e1 , . . . , e8 } and
      nonvanishing brackets: [e1 , e2 ] = e5 , [e1 , e3 ] = e6 , [e1 , e4 ] = e7 , [e1 , e5 ] =
      −e8 , [e2 , e3 ] = e8 , [e2 , e4 ] = e6 , [e2 , e6 ] = −e7 , [e3 , e4 ] = −e5 , [e3 , e5 ] =
      −e7 , [e4 , e6 ] = −e8 .
      L is characteristically nilpotent [DL]. L is also square integrable of index 2,
      but it does not admit a CP-ideal (and not any CP’s either, see section 4).


      Proof. Suppose L has a CP-ideal P . So, P is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal
      of L. Now take the linear functional f = e∗7 ∈ L∗ , which is regular. Put
      A = ke8 ⊂ Z(L). This is a 1-dimensional ideal of L contained in P and
      f (A) = 0. By Lemma 1.13 Q = P/A is a CP-ideal of L/A. Clearly,
      L/A is a 7- dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra of index 1, with basis x1 =
      e1 + A, . . . , x7 = e7 + A. So, Q is a 4-dimensional abelian ideal of L/A. One
      verifies that there are λ, µ ∈ k, not both zero such that Q is generated by
      λx1 + µx4 , x5 , x6 , x7 . Then P is generated by λe1 + µe4 , e5 , e6 , e7 , e8 . But
      this contradicts the fact that P is commutative, since

                   [λe1 + µe4 , e5 ] = −λe8 and [λe1 + µe4 , e6 ] = −µe8

 (ii) Let V be a vector space over k with basis              e1 , . . . , en ;   n ≥ 2.    Take the
                     2
                     V
      vector space       V with basis     eij = ei ∧ ej ,    i < j.         Next, consider the Lie
      algebra
                                                     2
                                                     V
                                         L=V ⊕           V
                                                                                             2
                                                                                             V
      with nonvanishing brackets [ei , ej ] = eij , i < j. Clearly, [L, L] = V =
      Z(L). So, L is 2-step nilpotent of dimension n + 21 n(n − 1) = 21 n(n + 1).
      Let x, y ∈ V . Then it is easy to see that

              [x, y] = 0 ⇔ x, y are linearly dependent over k                        (∗)




                                               12
     Next, we take n to be even. Then, rankR(L) ([ei , ej ]) = n.              This implies that

                                       1
                     i(L) = dim L − n = n(n − 1) = dim Z(L)
                                       2
     i.e. L is square integrable.

Finally, take n = 4. Then dim L = 10, dim Z(L) = i(L) = 6 and
1
2
  (dim L + i(L)) = 8. But, because of (∗), L has no 8-dimensional abelian Lie
subalgebra containing Z(L), i.e. L has no CP’s. The same holds for all even
n ≥ 4, using a similar argument.

THEOREM 3.2 Let L be a Lie algebra having a nondegenerate, invariant bilinear
form b. Then F (L) = L. In particular, L does not admit a CP unless L is abelian.

Proof.    Take y ∈ L and consider the map ϕy sending each x ∈ L into
b(x, y). Clearly, ϕy ∈ L∗ and the map ϕ : L → L∗ sending y into ϕy is an
isomorphism of L-modules. Consequently, y and ϕy have the same stabilizer in L,
i.e. C(y) = L(ϕy ).
Next, put Ω = ϕ−1 (L∗reg ). Then,
                              P                  P                P
                  F (L) =              L(f ) =         L(ϕy ) =         C(y)
                            f ∈L∗reg             y∈Ω              y∈Ω


Clearly, F (L) contains Ω, which is an open dense subset of L for the Zariski topology
since ϕ is a linear isomorphism. Consequently, F (L) = L.

EXAMPLES 3.3

 (1) L semi-simple (take b to be the Killing form of L).

 (2) The diamond Lie algebra with basis t, x, y, z and nonvanishing brackets
     [t, x] = −x, [t, y] = y and [x, y] = z. Let b be the symmetric bilinear
     form with nonzero entries b(t, z) = 1 and b(x, y) = −1.

 (3) Let g5 be the 5-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra over k with basis x1 , . . . , x5
     and nonvanishing brackets [x1 , x2 ] = x3 , [x1 , x3 ] = x4 , [x2 , x3 ] = x5 .
     Let b be the symmetric bilinear form with nonzero entries:

                    b(x1 , x5 ) = b(x3 , x3 ) = 1 and b(x2 , x4 ) = −1




                                                 13
 (4) Let g6 be the 6-dimensional 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra with basis x1 , . . . , x6
     and nonvanishing brackets [x1 , x2 ] = x6 , [x1 , x3 ] = x4 , [x2 , x3 ] = x5 .
     Let b be the symmetric bilinear form with nonzero entries:

                    b(x1 , x5 ) = b(x3 , x6 ) = 1 and b(x2 , x4 ) = −1

     (see [B1, p.133])

 (5) Consider the semi-direct product L = sl(2, k) ⊕ W2 , where W2 is the 3-
     dimensional irreducible sl(2, k)-module. L also admits a nondegenerate, in-
     variant, symmetric bilinear form.


PROPOSITION 3.4 Among all the different types of indecomposable nilpotent
Lie algebras over C
                  I of dimension n ≤ 7, only the following 30 Lie algebras do not
have a CP:

  1) n = 5:    g5 (see (3) of Examples 3.3)

  2) n = 6: From Morozov’s classification [Mo, p.168] the Lie algebras          3(∼
                                                                                  =g6 ),
     21 and 22.

  3) n = 7: From Seeley’s classification [See]: 2, 5, 7K ; 2, 5, 7L ; 2, 4, 7D ;
     2, 4, 7E ; 2, 4, 7G ; 2, 4, 7H ; 2, 4, 7J ; 2, 4, 7K ; 2, 4, 7Q ; 2, 4, 7R ;
     2, 3, 5, 7C ; 2, 3, 5, 7D ; 2, 3, 4, 5, 7B ; 2, 3, 4, 5, 7C ; 2, 3, 4, 5, 7D ;
     2, 3, 4, 5, 7F ; 2, 3, 4, 5, 7G ; 1, 3, 5, 7S , ξ = 1; 1, 3, 4, 5, 7H ;
     1, 2, 4, 5, 7C ; 1, 2, 4, 5, 7F ; 1, 2, 4, 5, 7H ; 1, 2, 4, 5, 7K ; 1, 2, 4, 5, 7L ;
     1, 2, 4, 5, 7N , ξ = 1; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7I , ξ = 0
     Note that the infinite families fail to have a CP only for exceptional values of
     the parameter ξ.

Proof: This is done case by case, considering only the ones that are not square
integrable (Proposition 2.2). Usually, CP’s are easy to spot by looking at the multi-
plication table. To prove that a Lie algebra L has no CP’s is more difficult however.
This can be achieved by using Proposition 1.9 or by showing that F (L) is not com-
mutative. For instance, take L = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7N , ξ = 1. See Remark 2.3 for its Lie
brackets. One verifies that F (L) = ha − b, c, d, e, f, gi, which is not commutative.

REMARK 3.5 Having a CP is not preserved under degeneration (for a definition
we refer to [GO1] or [GO2]). Indeed, g5 , which has no CP’s (see 3 of Examples



                                          14
3.3), is a degeneration of the Lie algebra h5 with basis x1 , . . . , x5 over C  I and
nonzero brackets [x1 , x2 ] = x3 , [x1 , x3 ] = x4 , [x1 , x4 ] = x5 and [x2 , x3 ] = x5
for which hx3 , x4 , x5 i is a CP. On the other hand, the Lie algebra j5 with the
same basis and nonzero brackets [x1 , x2 ] = x3 and [x1 , x3 ] = x4 admits a CP
(namely hx2 , x3 , x4 , x5 i) and is a degeneration of g5 [GO1, p.323].


                                  4. CP-IDEALS

These are by far the most interesting CP’s. The following shows that they occur as
often as ordinary CP’s, at least in the solvable case.

THEOREM 4.1 Let L be solvable and k algebraically closed. Let m be the
maximum dimension of all abelian ideals of L. Clearly, m ≤ 21 (dim L + i(L))
[O2, p. 706]. Then the following are equivalent:

 (1) L admits a CP

 (2) L admits a CP-ideal

 (3) m = 21 (dim L + i(L))

Proof. It suffices to show that (1) ⇒ (2), since (2) ⇒ (1) and (2) ⇔ (3)
are clear. Let G be the adjoint algebraic group of L, i.e. the smallest algebraic
subgroup of AutL such that L(G) contains adL [D, 1.1.14]. Clearly, adL and
hence its algebraic hull L(G) are solvable (since they have the same derived algebra
[Ch, p.173], which is nilpotent). Therefore G is a solvable connected group. Next
put p = 21 (dim L+i(L)). Then the set C of all CP’s is a nonempty (by assumption)
closed subset of the Grassmannian Gr(L, p), which is an irreducible and complete
algebraic variety [D, 1.11.8-9]. Hence C is also complete. Now G acts morphically
on C, mapping each CP H on g(H), g ∈ G. By Borel’s theorem, G has a fixed
point P in C [Bo, p.242]. So, g(P ) = P for all g ∈ G. In particular, adx(P ) ⊂ P
for all x ∈ L. Consequently, P is a CP-ideal of L.

REMARK 4.2 (a) The number m is an important characteristic of a Lie algebra,
often used in classifications.
(b) It is now easy to see that the 8-dimensional Lie algebra (i) of 3.1 has no CP’s
(go over to the algebraic closure of k and use Theorem 4.1).




                                          15
THEOREM 4.3 Let P be an ideal of a Lie algebra L and let P be a polarization
of L with respect to some f ∈ L∗ . Then we have

 (1) If f ∈ L∗reg then P is solvable (in fact P ′′ = 0). If in addition L is
     Frobenius or nilpotent of index one, then P is a CP-ideal of L.

 (2) If k is algebraically closed and         f ∈ L∗reg ,   then the induced representation
     ind(f |P , L) is simple.

 (3) If L is completely solvable then P is a Vergne polarization. In particular,
     ind(f |P , L) is absolutely simple.

Proof.

 (1) Take    x∈L       and     y, y ′ ∈ P ,   then

                        f ([x, [y, y ′]]) = f ([[x, y], y ′]) + f ([y, [x, y ′]])
                                          = 0 since P is an ideal

     and    f ([P, P ]) = 0.


     Hence, [y, y ′] ∈ L(f ). Therefore, P ′ = [P, P ] ⊂ L(f ). This implies that
     P ′′ = 0 since L(f ) is abelian by [D,1.11.7]. Now, suppose L is Frobenius,
     i.e. i(L) = 0. Then L(f ) = 0 which forces [P, P ] = 0. On the other
     hand, if L is nilpotent of index 1, then dim L(f ) = 1. We may assume that
     f 6= 0. Clearly, [P, P ] 6= L(f ) since f ([P, P ]) = 0 and f (L(f )) 6= 0
     [BC, p.89]. So, we conclude that [P, P ] = 0.

 (2) By [RV, p.395] or [D, 10.5.7] there exists a solvable polarization H of L w.r.t.
     f such that H ∩ P is a solvable polarization of P w.r.t. f |P and such that
     the twisted induced representation ind∼ (f |H , L) is simple. First we observe
     that

                  dim H = 12 (dim L + dim L(f )) = dim P                        (•)

     Similarly,

                    dim(H ∩ P ) = 21 (dim P + dim P (f |P )) = dim P




                                               16
     since P (f |P ) = {x ∈ P | f ([x, P ]) = 0} = P . It follows that H ∩ P = P ,
     i.e. P ⊂ H. Hence, by (•), we see that P = H.
     Consequently, ind∼ (f |P , L) is simple. Finally, ind∼ (f |P , L) = ind(f |P , L)
     because P is an ideal of L [D, 5.2.1].

 (3) L being completely solvable, we can find a flag of ideals of L:

                       L = Ln ⊃ . . . ⊃ Lp ⊃ . . . ⊃ L1 ⊃ L0 = (0)
                                                                                 P
     such that   Lp = P where p = dim P . Put fi = f |Li and Pj =                      Li (fi ).
                                                                                 i≤j
     Then Pn is the so called Vergne polarization w.r.t. this flag and f ∈ L∗ [BGR,
     9.4]. We claim that P = Pn . Clearly,

                      Li (fi ) = {x ∈ Li | f ([x, Li ]) = 0} = Li ∩ L⊥
                                                                     i


     In particular,    Lp (fp ) = Lp ∩ L⊥p = P ∩ P
                                                   ⊥
                                                     = P since P = P ⊥ w.r.t.
     f ∈ L∗ . This    implies that P ⊂ Pn . On the other hand consider Lj (fj ).
     If j ≤ p, then    Lj (fj ) ⊂ Lj ⊂ Lp = P .
     If j > p, then    P = Lp ⊂ Lj implies that Lj (fj ) = Lj ∩ L⊥    ⊥
                                                                 j ⊂ Lj ⊂ P
                                                                            ⊥
                                                                              =
                                    n
                                    P
     P.   Consequently,      Pn =         Lj (fj ) ⊂ P .
                                    j=1



COROLLARY 4.4           Let P be a CP-ideal of a Lie algebra L and take any
f ∈ L∗reg . Then,

  1. If k is algebraically closed, then       ind(f |P , L)   is simple.

  2. If L is completely solvable, then P is a Vergne polarization w.r.t. f and any
     flag of ideals containing P . In particular, ind(f |P , L) is absolutely simple.

  3. (a) Sz(U(L)) ⊂ U(P ) and Sz(D(L)) ⊂ D(P ) where Sz(U(L)) =
         L
           U(L)λ is the semi-center of U(L). Similarly for Sz(D(L)). This
           λ
          generalizes [D, 6.1.6].
                                                                             T
      (b) Put ∧(L) = {λ ∈ L∗          | U(L)λ 6= 0} and L∧ =                        ker λ.     Then,
                                                                           λ∈∧(L)
          P ⊂ L∧ .


Proof. (1) and (2) follow directly from Theorem 4.3.
(3) Let u ∈ U(L)λ be any semi-invariant with weight                λ ∈ ∧(L),         i.e.    [x, u] =



                                               17
λ(x)u for all x ∈ L.
Now, take x ∈ P . Then adx(L) ⊂ P and (adx)2 = 0 since P is a com-
mutative ideal of L. So, adx is nilpotent. This implies that λ(x) = 0 and
[x, u] = 0. Consequently, x ∈ L∧ which shows (b) and also u ∈ C(U(P )) =
U(P ).     Therefore, Sz(U(L)) ⊂ U(P ).    Similarly for Sz(D(L)) ⊂ D(P )
(since C(D(P )) = D(P )).

REMARK 4.5 The previous corollary does not hold for arbitrary CP’s of L. For
example, let L be the 2-dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field
k with basis x, y and nonzero bracket [x, y] = y. L is Frobenius and f ∈ L∗
with f (x) = 0 and f (y) = 1 is regular. Clearly, P = kx is a CP of L w.r.t.
f ∈ L∗ . But ind∼ (f |P , L) is not simple [BGR, p.95]. Also, y is a semi-invariant
of L but y ∈ / U(P ).

The following, which we recall from [O2, p.708], describes how CP-ideals naturally
arise in certain semi-direct products.

PROPOSITION 4.6. Let g be a Lie algebra with basis {x1 , . . . , xm } and
let V be a g-module with basis {v1 , . . . , vn } with dimg ≤ dim V . For each
f ∈ V ∗ we put

                  g(f ) = {x ∈ g | f (xv) = 0 for all v ∈ V }

the stabilizer of f . Consider the semi-direct product L = g ⊕ V in which
[x, v] = xv, x ∈ g, v ∈ V and in which V is an abelian ideal. Then the
following are equivalent:

 (1) D(V ) (= R(V )) is a maximal subfield of D(L)

 (2) V is a CP-ideal of L

 (3) i(L) = dim V − dim g

 (4) rankR(V ) (ei vj ) = dim g

 (5) g(f ) = 0   for some    f ∈V∗




                                        18
REMARK 4.7 If k is algebraically closed, g a simple Lie algebra, acting irre-
ducibly on V , then the conditions of the proposition are satisfied if and only if
dim g < dim V . [AVE, p.196].

The following shows that if a Lie algebra L admits a CP-ideal then its structure
comes close to that of the semi-direct product considered in Proposition 4.6.

COROLLARY 4.8 Let V be a commutative ideal of L. Clearly, the Lie algebra
g = L/V acts on V . Consider the semi-direct product L1 = g ⊕ V . Then,

                        V is a CP of L   ⇔ V is a CP of L1

In that case,   i(L1 ) = i(L).

Proof.     Let g ∈ L∗     and put    f = g|V ∈ V ∗ .         Then, we claim that   g(f ) =
V g /V .   Indeed,

                 x = x + V ∈ g(f )       ⇔        f ([x, V ]) = 0
                                         ⇔        f ([x, V ]) = 0
                                         ⇔        g([x, V ]) = 0
                                         ⇔        x∈Vg      ⇔ x ∈ V g /V

We now proceed with the proof
⇒: dim V = 12 (dim L + i(L)). Also, V g = V for some g ∈ L∗                   by Lemma
1.1. Hence, g(f ) = 0. By Proposition 4.6 V is a CP of L1 and

                i(L1 ) = dim V − dim g = dim V − (dim L − dim V )
                                         = 2 dim V − dim L = i(L).

⇐: By Proposition 4.6, g(f ) = 0 for some f ∈ V ∗ . Next, choose g ∈ L∗
such that f = g|V . Then, V g /V = g(f ) = 0. So, V g = V which by
Lemma 1.2 implies that V is a CP of L.


       5. CP-IDEALS IN CERTAIN FROBENIUS LIE ALGEBRAS

Let L be a Frobenius Lie algebra with a CP-ideal P . Take any f ∈ L∗reg and
assume that k is algebraically closed. Then I(f ) = 0 by [O1, p.42]. So, by




                                             19
Corollary 4.4 ind(f |P , L) is a faithful irreducible representation of U(L). Next,
let x1 , . . . , xm , y1 , . . . , ym be a basis of L such that y1 , . . . , ym is a basis of P .
Then det([xi , yj ]) ∈ S(P ) is a nonzero semi- invariant under the action of AutL
[O1,p.28]. It is also known that Frobenius Lie algebras give rise to constant solutions
for the classical Yang- Baxter equation [BD].

The following is a special case of Proposition 4.6.

COROLLARY 5.1 Let g be a Lie algebra and V a g-module such that dim g
= dim V . Consider the semi- direct product L = g ⊕ V . Then the following are
equivalent:

 (1) R(V ) is a maximal subfield of D(L)

 (2) V is a CP-ideal of L

 (3) L is Frobenius

 (4) g(f ) = 0     for some     f ∈V∗

EXAMPLE 5.2 Let g be Frobenius and let V = g be the adjoint representation.

EXAMPLE 5.3 The above condition is satisfied if g is reductive over an alge-
braically closed field k and V ∗ is a prehomogeneous g-module (i.e. V ∗ has an open
g-orbit) with dim g = dim V . These modules have been studied extensively by the
Japanese school since 1977 [SK], [KKTI].

EXAMPLE 5.4 Let A be a left-symmetric algebra (LSA), i.e. a finite dimensional
vector space provided with a bilinear product A × A → A, (a, b) → ab which
satisfies

                  a(bc) − (ab)c = b(ac) − (ba)c                       (∗)

for all a, b, c ∈ A. There is an extensive literature on LSA’s, see for example
[H], [Seg]. Vinberg used LSA’s to classify convex homogeneous cones [V]. A left-
symmetric algebra is Lie-admissable. This means that A becomes a Lie algebra,
which we denote by g, for the Lie bracket [a, b] = ab − ba, a, b ∈ A. Using (∗)
we observe that

                        [a, b]c = (ab)c − (ba)c = a(bc) − b(ac).



                                               20
Therefore, A becomes a g-module, which we denote by V , for the bilinear map

                            g × V → V, (x, v) → xv

Now, suppose A contains a nonzero element f ∈ A which is not a right zero
divisor of A. Let V ∗ be the dual module of V . Identifying the module V ∗∗ with V ,
we may consider f to be an element of (V ∗ )∗ . Clearly, the stabilizer g(f ) = {x ∈
g | xf = 0} = 0 by assumption.
Finally, using Corollary 5.1 we may conclude that the semi-direct product
L = g ⊕ V ∗ is a Frobenius Lie algebra in which V ∗ is a CP-ideal.

REMARK 5.5 In characteristic p > 2 a similar result can be obtained if A is a
finite dimensional simple Novikov algebra and where V is a certain irreducible A-
module. We recall that a nonassociative k-algebra is said to be a left Novikov algebra
if A is left symmetric, satisfying the identity (ab)c = (ac)b for all a, b, c ∈ A.
In characteristic zero E. Zelmanov showed that finite dimensional simple Novikov
algebras are all one- dimensional [Z]. Recently simple Novikov algebras and their
irreducible modules have been determined by M. Osborn and X. Xu [Os], [X].

We now focus on a special case, which provides an interesting link between Frobenius
algebras and Frobenius Lie algebras.

PROPOSITION 5.6 Let A be a finite dimensional associative algebra over k
with a unit element. A becomes a Lie algebra g for the Lie bracket [a, b] = ab − ba,
a, b ∈ A, and V = A becomes a g-module by left multiplication. Consider the
semi-direct product L = g ⊕ V . Then the following conditions are equivalent:

 (1) A is a Frobenius algebra

 (2) L is a Frobenius Lie algebra

 (3) V is a CP-ideal of L

 (4) R(V ) is a maximal subfield of D(L)

Proof.   In view of Corollary 5.1 it suffices to show that (1) is equivalent with
g(f ) = 0 for some f ∈ V ∗ . So, take f ∈ V ∗ . Then

                    g(f ) = {a ∈ A | f (ab) = 0 for all b ∈ A}




                                         21
Clearly, g(f ) = 0 if and only if the bilinear map A × A → k, (a, b) → f (ab)
is nondegenerate, i.e. A is a Frobenius algebra [CR, Theorem 61.3].

Finally, we devote our attention to certain Frobenius Lie subalgebras of a semi-
simple Lie algebra.

THEOREM 5.7 Let L be a semi-simple Lie algebra of rank r over k, k alge-
braically closed, and let x be a principal nilpotent element of L (i.e. the centralizer
C(x) of x in L has dimension r). Then the normalizer F of C(x) in L is a solvable
Frobenius Lie subalgebra of L in which C(x) is a CP-ideal.

Proof.   It is well known that C(x) is abelian [K]. Clearly, C(x) is an ideal of
F . In 1991 R. Brylinski and B. Kostant showed that dim F = 2r and that
F/C(x), and hence also F , is solvable [BK]. Recently, D. Panyushev proved that
F is Frobenius [P2, Theorem 5.5].


     6. CP-IDEALS IN THE NILRADICAL OF PARABOLIC LIE
           SUBALGEBRAS OF A SIMPLE LIE ALGEBRA

THEOREM 6.1 Let B be a Borel subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra L over k,
k algebraically closed, of rank r and let N be the nilradical of B. Then,

 (1) N admits a CP ⇔ L is of type Ar or Cr .
     In these 2 cases N has a CP-ideal P , which is an ideal of B.

 (2) P is also a CP-ideal of B in case L is of type Cr ,   r ≥ 1.

Proof. The information on i(N), i(B) in table 1 is obtained from [E1], [E2].
Also, we know that i(N) + i(B) = r [P2, 1.5].

                                     Table 1

The idea is to compare the maximum dimension m of abelian Lie subalgebras of
N, computed by Malcev [Ma, p.216] with the number 21 (dim N + i(N)). Then
N contains a CP if and only if these numbers coincide. According to the table this
occurs precisely if L is of type Ar or Cr .
Furthermore, we know from [PR, Table 1] that in both types (Ar or Cr ) B has
a maximal abelian ideal P of dimension 12 (dim N + i(N)).       Clearly P ⊂ N.
Therefore P is a CP-ideal of N. This can also be deduced from Theorem 4.1.
(2) Using Lemma 1.3 we see that P is also a CP-ideal of B if and only if

                 i(N) = i(B) + dim B − dim N
                        ⇔     i(N) − i(B) = r
                        ⇔     i(B) = 0 (since    i(N) + i(B) = r).

and this happens when L is of type    A1 (= C1 ) or Cr ,   r ≥ 2.

THEOREM 6.2 Let L be a simple Lie algebra over k, k algebraically closed, of
type Ar or Cr , π a parabolic Lie subalgebra of L. Then the nilradical N of π admits

  a) The first formula is new. A recursive formula for i(N) was already established
     in [E1]. A different proof for the second formula can also be found in [E1].

  b) (made by the referee) A. Joseph already gave a formula for i(N) in an arbitrary
     simple Lie algebra, using a maximal subset of strongly orthogonal positive
     roots [J, (ii) of Proposition 2.6]. Being applied to Ar or Cr , Joseph’s formula
     gives the above explicit expressions.

Proof. (1) Let L = sl(V ) where V is an n- dimensional vector space over k. By
[B2, p.187] we can find a flag F of subspaces of V :

                    {0} = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Fm = V, Fi−1 ⊂ Fi
                                                                  6=


such that π (respectively its nilradical N) consists of all endomorphisms x ∈ L
such that xFi ⊂ Fi (resp.            xFi ⊂ Fi−1 ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.                  Put pi =
dim(Fi /Fi−1 ) then π is said to be of type (p1 , . . . , pm ). Next, choose a basis
e1 , . . . , en of V compatible with the flag F (i.e. e1 , . . . , ep1 ∈ F1 \F0 , etc.). Then,
N can be considered to be the Lie algebra of matrices of the form as shown in figure
1.

                                          Figure 1

We may assume, as is the case in figure 1, that p ≤ n2 (∗). In particular,
p + pℓ+1 > n2 . As usual we denote by Eij the n × n matrix whose ij-th entry
is 1 and other entries are zero. Let P be the subspace of N generated by all Eij
with
       1≤ i ≤ p; p + 1 ≤ j ≤ n.           So, P consists of matrices of the form

   0 M 
              where M is any p × (n − p) matrix. It is easy to see that P is an
   0 0
abelian ideal of N. We claim that P is a CP of N. Let f ∈ N ∗ be defined by
f (Ep,n−p+1) = . . . = f (E1n ) = 1 and zero on all other Eij . We want to show that
P f = P . Therefore we take x ∈ P f . We write
                                         P
                                   x=         λij Eij + y
                                        i<j

where Eij ∈ N\P , λij ∈ k and y ∈ P . We need to demonstrate that each
λi0 j0 = 0. There are two cases to distinguish:

  (i) j0 ≤ p. Then i0 < j0 ≤ p                and       s = (n + 1) − i0 > (n + 1) − p > p.
      Hence, Ej0 s ∈ P and
                                              P
                  0 = f ([x, Ej0 s ]) =             λij f ([Eij , Ej0 s ]) + f ([y, Ej0s ])

                         = λ i0 j 0

     (f (Ej0 j ) = 0    since       j0 + j > i0 + s = n + 1)

 (ii) i0 > p and j0 > p1 + . . . + pℓ + pℓ+1 > .
                                              2
      By definition of p:
                                                                      n  n
                                (p1 + . . . + pℓ + pℓ+1 ) −             ≥ −p
                                                                      2  2
     Hence

                         j0 ≥ (p1 + . . . + pℓ + pℓ+1 ) + 1 ≥ n − p + 1

     So,   t = (n + 1) − j0 ≤ p < i0               and          Eti0 ∈ P . Therefore
                                                    P
                       0 = f ([Eti0 , x]) =               λij f ([Eti0 , Eij ]) + f ([Eti0 , y])

                                P

                                i<j
                                 P                        P
                          =            λi0 j f (Etj ) −         λit f (Eii0 )
                                j>i0                      i<t
                          = λ i0 j 0

     (f (Eii0 ) = 0     since     i + i0 < t + j0 = n + 1).

In both cases: x = y ∈ P . So, P f ⊂ P . Consequently, P f = P                                     as the
other inclusion is obvious by the commutativity of P .
                                                          ∗
By Lemma 1.2 we may conclude that P is a CP of N and f ∈ Nreg .
                         1
Finally, from dim P = 2 (dim N + i(N)) we obtain:

                             i(N) = 2 dim P − dim N
                                                1      m
                                                       P
                                  = 2p(n − p) − (n2 −     p2i )
                                                2     i=1

(2) Let L = sp(V ) where V is a vector space over k of dimension n = 2r provided
with a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form ϕ : V × V → k. There exists an
isotropic flag

                              {0} = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Fm = V

i.e. Fi⊥ = Fm−i for 0 ≤ i ≤ m such that π (respectively its nilradical N)
consists of all x ∈ L such that xFi ⊂ Fi (resp. xFi ⊂ Fi−1 ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.



                                                      26
Put pi = dim(Fi /Fi−1 ) then it follows that pi = pm+1−i                                       for      1 ≤ i ≤ m.
Following [B2, p.200] we can find a Witt basis of V :

                                    e1 , . . . , er , e−r , . . . , e−1

compatible with the given flag and such that ϕ(ei , e−j ) = δij .
We now
      identify
              each x ∈ L with its matrix with respect to this basis, i.e.
        A B                                                                    b

second diagonal. If x ∈ N then x is of the form as shown in figure 2.

                                      x=            λij Xεi −εj + y
                                              i<j

where Xεi −εj ∈ N, λij ∈ k and y ∈ P .                                              Fix any λst , s < t with
Xεs −εt ∈ N.  This implies that s ≤ r − r1 ,                                       t ≤ r.  Hence Xεs +εt ∈ P .
Therefore,
                                              P
           0 = f ([x, Xεs +εt ]) =                λij f ([Xεi −εj , Xεs+εt ]) + f ([y, Xεs+εt ])
                                           i<j
                  P
              =         λij f (δjs Xεi+εt + δjt Xεi +εs )
                  i<j
                  P                             P
              =         λis f (Xεi +εt ) +              λit f (Xεi+εs )
                  i<s                           i<t
              = 0 + λst

(f (Xεi +εt ) = 0 since i < s < t).
It follows that x = y ∈ P . So, P f ⊂ P . Consequently, P f = P as the
other inclusion is obvious. By Lemma 1.2 we may conclude that P is a CP of N
               ∗
and f ∈ Nreg     . Finally,

           i(N) = 2 dim P − dim N
                                                                                            ℓ

                      7. CP-PRESERVING EXTENSIONS

PROPOSITION 7.1 Let M be a finite dimensional Lie algebra over k and let
d ∈ DerM be a derivation such that d(Z(M)) 6= 0. Consider the extension
L = M ⊕ kd in which [d, x] = d(x), x ∈ M.
Then we have
  (i) i(M) = i(L) + 1.

 (ii) L has a CP if and only if M has a CP.

 (ii) If L is square integrable, then so is M.
REMARK 7.2            Example (3) of 1.7 shows that the condition on d cannot be
removed.

Proof. Take u ∈ Z(M) such that d(u) 6= 0.                       Clearly   M = C(u).       Now
the assertions follow directly from Proposition 1.8.

PROPOSITION 7.3 Let M be a finite dimensional Lie algebra over k and fix z,
a nonzero central element of M. Let S be a 2r-dimensional vector space, provided
with a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form ϕ : S × S → k. Consider the Lie
algebra L = M ⊕ S containing M as an ideal and in which [x, s] = 0 and
[s, t] = ϕ(s, t)z for x ∈ M; s, t ∈ S. Then we have
  (i) H = S ⊕ kz       is a Heisenberg Lie algebra

 (ii) i(L) = i(M)      and    Z(L) = Z(M)

 (iii) M is square integrable if and only if L is square integrable

 (iv) If M allows a CP (resp. a CP-ideal) then the same holds for L.
Proof. (i) It is easy to verify that L is a Lie algebra. There exists a f ∈ L∗reg
                      ∗
such that f |M ∈ Mreg      and f (z) 6= 0. We may assume that f (z) = 1 (by
                  1
replacing f by        f ). Then for all s, t ∈ S
                f (z)
                             Bf (s, t) = f ([s, t]) = ϕ(s, t)

From the assumption on ϕ, S ∩ S ⊥ = 0 and we can find a basis s1 , . . . , sr ; t1 , . . . , tr
of S such that for all i, j:

                    ϕ(si , sj ) = 0 = ϕ(ti , tj ) and ϕ(si , tj ) = δij



                                              29
This implies [si , sj ] = 0 = [ti , tj ] and [si , tj ] = δij z for all i, j. Consequently,
H is a Heisenberg Lie algebra.
(ii) First, we notice that M = S ⊥ . Indeed, M ⊂ S ⊥ since f ([M, S]) = 0.
For the other inclusion, take x ∈ S ⊥ , which we decompose as x = m + s with
m ∈ M and s ∈ S. Then, s = x−m ∈ S ∩ S ⊥ = {0}. Hence, x = m ∈ M.
As M = S ⊥ we deduce from [D,1.12.4] that

                   M(f |M ) = M ∩ M ⊥ = S ∩ S ⊥ + L⊥ = L(f )

Taking dimensions yields i(M) = i(L). Clearly, the elements of Z(M) commute
with those of M and S. Hence, Z(M) ⊂ Z(L). Conversely, take x ∈ Z(L)
which we can decompose as x = m + s with m ∈ M and s ∈ S. For all
s′ ∈ S:

                     [s, s′ ] = [x − m, s′ ] = [x, s′ ] − [m, s′ ] = 0

and hence also ϕ(s, s′ ) = f ([s, s′]) = 0 which implies that s = 0 and so
x = m ∈ M ∩ Z(L) ⊂ Z(M).
(iii) This follows at once from (ii).
(iv) Suppose P1 is a CP of M. Put P2 = ks1 + . . . + ksr and P = P1 ⊕ P2 .
Then P is a CP of L since P is commutative and

  dim P = dim P1 + dim P2 = 21 (dim M + i(M)) + 21 dim S = 12 (dim L + i(L)).

Finally, if P1 is an ideal of M then P is an ideal of L since

                 [M, P ] = [M, P1 ] + [M, P2 ] = [M, P1 ] ⊂ P1 ⊂ P

and

                    [tj , P ] = [tj , P1 ] + [tj , P2 ] = [tj , P2 ]
                                   P
                              =         k[tj , si ] = kz ⊂ Z(M) ⊂ P1 ⊂ P.
                                    i

PROPOSITION 7.4 Let A be an n-dimensional commutative (associative) Fro-
benius algebra over k and M an m-dimensional Lie algebra over k.
Consider the Lie algebra L = A ⊗k M for which [a ⊗ x, a′ ⊗ y] = aa′ ⊗ [x, y],
a, a′ ∈ A and x, y ∈ M. Then we have

  (i) M is square integrable if and only if L is square integrable.

 (ii) M is Frobenius if and only if L is Frobenius.



                                                30
(iii) If M allows a CP (resp. a CP-ideal) then the same holds for L.

Proof. (i) From [F, p.241-243] we know that i(L) = n.i(M). On the other
hand, Z(L) = A ⊗k Z(M) and so dim Z(L) = n. dim Z(M). Therefore,
i(L) = dim Z(L) if and only if i(M) = dim Z(M).
(ii) This follows from (i) and its proof.
(iii) Let P be a CP (resp. a CP-ideal) of M. Then Q = A ⊗k P is a commutative
Lie subalgebra (resp. ideal) of L and

                      dim Q = n. dim P = n. 21 (dim M + i(M))
                  = 21 (n. dim M + n.i(M)) = 12 (dim L + i(L))
