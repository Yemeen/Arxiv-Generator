                                             Introduction. In this survey, we describe and relate various occurences of quivers
                                             of type A (both finite and affine) and their canonical bases in combinatorics, in
                                             algebraic geometry and in representation theory. The ubiquity of these quivers
                                             makes them especially important to study : they are pervasive in very classical
                                             topics (such as the theory of symmetric functions) as well as in some of the most
                                             recent and exciting areas of representation theory (such as representation theory of
                                             quantum affine algebras, affine Hecke algebras or Cherednik algebras).

                                             . There is a vast litterature on the subject and we have been forced to make a
                                             choice in the selection of the results presented here. We believe that one of the
                                             main reasons for the omnipresence of quivers of type A is the fact that they are
                                             related (in more than one way) to classical and fundamental objects in geomet-
                                             ric representation theory of type A such as (partial) flag varieties and nilpotent
                                             orbits. This is the point we tried to emphasize in this survey. For that reason,
                                             many interesting and important results are only alluded to or sketched here and we
                                             apologize to all those whose work we did not mention through a lack of space and
                                             competence. Also, we do not give complete proofs of all results presented here and
                                             refer to the original papers whenever possible. Rather, we have tried to convey the
                                             fundamental ideas in a nontechnical way as much as possible.

                                             . This survey is organized as follows. In Section 1 we describe some basic geometric
                                             properties of quivers of type A and their representation spaces. Section 2 is a brief
                                             reminder on Ringel-Hall algebras and their canonical bases, and in Sections 3 and 4
                                             we describe the Ringel-Hall algebras of the categories of representations of quivers
                                                        (1)                 (1)
                                             of type A1 and type An , An respectively. This makes a link with combinatorics
                                             (symmetric functions, [Mac]) and with quantum group theory ([Ri1], [S1]). In Sec-
                                             tion 5 we recall some classical geometric constructions in type A such as (partial,
                                             affine) flag varieties, nilpotent orbits, Hecke algebras and various convolution alge-
                                             bras. In Section 6, we give a first link between quivers of type A and (partial, affine)
                                             Schubert varieties; one important consequence is that the coefficients of the canon-
                                             ical basis of the Hall algebras of quivers of type A are given by Kazhdan-Lusztig
                                             polynomials ([Lu1], [Z1]). Section 7 gives the geometric realization of Schur-Weyl
                                             duality and its affine and quantum cousins. This gives a conceptual explanation for
                                             some of the results in Section 4. We totally change perspective in Section 8 and,
                                             following [LLT], [A] and [VV1], we present a surprising and beautiful application
                                             of the theory of canonical bases and quivers of type A to character forumlae for
                                             quantum affine algebras and affine Hecke algebras (at roots of unity). Finally, we
                                             gather a few more interesting occurences of quivers of type A in relation to geome-
                                             try (Nakajima quiver varieties, parabolic structures on curves and surfaces) in the

                                  1. Quivers of type A
1.1. We will denote by ∆n the (equioriented) quiver of type An , with vertex set
In = {1, . . . , n} and with edge set {(i, i + 1) | i = 1, . . . , n − 1}. Similarly, we
     (1)                                                             (1)
let ∆n stand for the (equioriented) affine quiver of type An−1 , with vertex set
Z/nZ and edge set {(i, i + 1) |i ∈ Z/nZ} (note that this also makes sense for
                                                                                     (1)
n = 1). Let k be any field. Recall that a representation
                                                 L                 of ∆n (resp. of ∆n )
over k consists of a pair (V, φ) where VL=         i Vi is an In -graded (resp. Z/nZ-
graded) k-vector space and φ = (φi ) ∈        i Hom(V  i , Vi+1 ). We let M odk (∆n ) be
                                                                                   (1)
the abelian category of representations of ∆n over k. In the case of ∆n we will
                                                                             (1)
impose an additional nilpotency condition; namely, we denote by M odk (∆n ) the
                                                  (1)
abelian category of representations (V, φ) of ∆n such that φN · · · φ2 φ1 = 0 for
N ≫ 0. This restriction may seem artificial from the strict point of view of quivers,
but it will appear naturally later in the context of flag varieties.

                                   (1)
1.2. Let ∆ be either ∆n or ∆n . The simple objects in M odk (∆) are naturally
in bijection with the vertices of ∆, and we will denote by Si the simple module
with V = Vi = k. Indecomposable objects of M odk (∆n ) are parametrized by
pairs (i; l) with i ∈ In and 1 ≤ l ≤ n + 1 − i : to (i; l) corresponds the unique
indecomposable object Si,l with top Si and length l. Similarly, indecomposable
                     (1)
objects of M odk (∆n ) are parametrized by pairs (i; l) with i ∈ Z/nZ and l ≥ 1,
and we use the same notation Si,l for the unique indecomposable with top Si and
length l. In particular, in both cases, the set of isomorphism classes of objects in
M odk (∆) is in bijection with a set of n-multipartitions (or n-multisegments)
                                           XX          (i)
                            m = (λ(i) )i =        (i; λt )
                                                    i         t

         (i)
where λt ≤ n + 1 − i if ∆ = ∆n .

                                                        (1)
1.3. Let ∆ again stand for either ∆n or ∆n . Let us fix a dimension Q
                                                                    vector d =
(di )i ∈ NI with I = In or I = Z/nZ according to ∆. The group Gd = i GLk (di )
acts naturally by conjugation on the space
                                         n−1
                                         M
                             E(d) =              Hom(k di , k di+1 )
                                           i=1

if ∆ = ∆n and on the space
                                   M
    E(d) = Enilp (d) = {(φi ) ∈            Hom(k di , k di+1 ) |φN · · · φ2 φ1 = 0 for N ≫ 0}
                                  i∈Z/nZ

          (1)
if ∆ = ∆n . Moreover, the set of Gd -orbits is (by definition) in bijection with the
set of isomorphism classes of objects in M odk (∆) of dimension d. We will denote
by Om the Gd -orbit (in the appropriate space) corresponding to a multipartition
m.
   Since there are only finitely many multipartitions of a given dimension d the
group Gd acts on E(d) with only finitely many orbits. It follows that there is
a (unique) dense orbit (the “generic representation of dimension d”); it is also
easy to see that there is a unique closed orbit (the semisimple representation of
                                                                              (1)
dimension d, in which all maps φi are zero). Observe that when ∆ = ∆1 we
recover the classical situation of the group GL(d) acting on the nilpotent cone
N = {x ∈ gld |xN = 0 for N ≫ 0}.
        QUIVERS OF TYPE A, FLAG VARIETIES AND REPRESENTATION THEORY                  3


1.4. We use the same notation as in 1.3. Let m be a multisegment of dimension
d. The Zariski closure Om is a union of Gd -orbits. This induces a partial order
≤ on the set of orbits, which can be explicitly described. More important for us
will be the geometric properties of the singular variety Om . The first result in this
direction is the following.
Theorem 1.1 ([ADK],[LM]). The variety Om is normal.
   This theorem has been generalized to quivers of type A and D with arbitrary ori-
entations by Bobinski-Zwara ([BZ1], [BZ2]), and is conjectured to hold for arbitrary
quivers (in the case of the nilpotent cone this is a well-known result of Kostant).
In the same spirit, Abeasis, Del Fra and Kraft constructed in [ADK] an explicit
desingularization of Om as follows :
. We first introduce some notation. Let dP= (d(1) , . . . , d(r) ) be a sequence of di-
mension vectors for ∆ and let us set d = t d(t) . We denote by Fd the variety of
flags
                                                    M
                         0 = L0 ⊂ L1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Lr =      k di
                                                       i
                                                      (t)
of I-graded vector spaces such that dim Lt /Lt−1 = d . This is a smooth projective
variety. Now consider
                  Xd = {((Lt ), x) ∈ Fd × E(d) | x(Li ) ⊂ Li−1 }.
                                          P P         (s) (t)
This is a vector bundle over Fd of rank     i    s<t di di−1 . In particular, it is
a smooth (quasi-projective) variety. On the other hand, the second projection
π : Xd → E(d) is a projective morphism.
Proposition 1.1. Let m be a multipartition and let x ∈ Om . Set
(1.1)                     d(t) = dim Ker (xt )/Ker (xt−1 ).
Then π(Xd ) = Om and π : Xd → Om is a resolution of singularities.
Proof. Since π is projective and Gd -equivariant, its image is a closed Gd -stable
subvariety. Moreover, since Xd is irreducible, so is π(Xd ). Therefore π(Xd ) = O
for some orbit O. Now let x ∈ π(Xd ). By definition, the points of the fiber of π
over x are the flags (Lt ) ∈ Fd which are compatible with x. It is easy to see that
such a flag is unique if and only if x ∈ Om . On the other hand, if (Lt ) is a flag
compatible with x and if (Lt ) ∈ π −1 (y) with y ∈ Om then x + uy ∈ Om for u in a
dense subset of C∗ . Thus x ∈ Om . The Proposition follows.                      ♦

                              (1)
. Observe that when ∆ = ∆1 and Om is the regular nilpotent orbit then Xd =
T ∗ B where B is the flag variety of GLd and the above resolution is just the Springer
resolution of the nilpotent cone. This construction of desingularizations of orbit
closures has been generalized to arbitrary finite type quivers by Reineke ([Re]).
Corollary 1.1. The dimension of the orbit Om is
                               X X (s) (t)       (t)

                                                      (1)
  In this section we let ∆ stand for either ∆n or ∆n .

2.1. We briefly recall the definition of Ringel-Hall algebras. Let k = Fq be a finite
field with q elements and let C = M odk (∆). It is known that C satisfies the following
conditions
     i) dim Exti (M, N ) < ∞ for any M, N ∈ C, i = 0, 1,
    ii) Exti (M, N ) = 0 for any i > 1 and M, N ∈ C.
Introduce two bilinear forms on K0 (C) ≃ ZI by the formulas
                    hM, N i = dim Hom(M, N ) − dim Ext1 (M, N ),

                                    (M, N ) = hM, N i + hN, M i.
Let us consider a C-vector space UC (or simply U) with a basis {[M ]} indexed by
the isomorphism classes of objects in C. Let us choose v ∈ C such that v −2 = q.
Finally let us denote by d(M ) ∈ NI the dimension of a representation M .
. We define an algebra structure on U by setting
                                                      X

the algebra generated by U and elements KM , M ∈ K0 (C) subject to the relations
KM KN = KM+N and KM [P ] = v −(M,P ) [P ]KM . We define a bialgebra structure

transparent.

2.2. Recall that the set of isomorphism classes of objects in M odk (∆) is in bijection
with a set of multipartitions.
Proposition 2.1 ([Mac], [Ri2]). Let m, n, l be arbitrary multipartitions. There
                     l
exists a polynomial Pm,n ∈ Z[t] such that for any finite field k with q elements we
        l      l
have Fm,n = Pm,n (q).
   The nice consequence of the above Proposition is that we now may (and we
now will) consider the Hall algebras UC and Ue C for a generic q, i.e as C[v, v −1 ]-
                        (1)
algebras. When ∆ = ∆1 then the isomorphism classes of objects are labelled by
usual partitions and the above polynomials are the Hall polynomials (see [Mac]).

2.3. Let us denote by CGd [E(d)] the set of Gd -invariant functions on E(d). Observe
that we have a natural identification of vector spaces
                            M
                       U≃       CGd [E(d)],       [m] 7→ 1Om .
                                 d

In this context, Lusztig gave in [Lu0] a geometric construction of the generic Hall
algebra U, in which one works over the algebraically closed field Fq and where
Gd -invariant functions are replaced by (complexes of) Gd -equivariant constructible
sheaves (see Saito’s paper in this volume). Observe that in our case there are only
finitely many Gd -orbits and these induce an algebraic stratification of E(d). In
particular, for every orbit Om ⊂ E(d), let ICOm be the simple Gd -equivariant
perverse sheaf associated to the constant sheaf COm . We set
                                     fm = v dim Om 1Om ,
                       X
               bm =           v −i+dim Om −dim Om′ dim HO
                                                        i
                                                          m′
                                                             (ICOm )fm′ ,
                       i,m′
         i
where HO   m′
              (ICOm ) is the stalk over any point of Om′ of the ith cohomology sheaf of
ICOm ). The bases {fm }m and {bm }m are called the PBW basis and the canonical
basis respectively. Observe that Green’s scalar product restricts to a nondegenerate
                                                                               ∗
form on U. It will be important for us to consider the dual PBW basis {fm        } and
                               ∗                                        ∗
the dual canonical basis {bm } with respect to h , iG . Note that fm and fm only
differ by a scalar in C[v, v −1 ]. For d ∈ NI we simply denote by fd (= bd ) the basis
element associated to the unique closed (=semisimple) orbit.

2.4. Finally, we note the following well-known recursive procedure to compute the
canonical basis {bm } of U. The Verdier duality functor on the (derived) category
of constructible Gd -sheaves on E(d) descends to a semilinear involution u 7→ u on
U. This involution can be computed :
Proposition 2.2. The involution u 7→ u is the unique ring homomorphism U → U
such that v = v −1 and fd = fd for all d ∈ NI .
Proof. It is standard that the involution u 7→ u has the above properties. Let
U′ ⊂ U be the subalgebra generated fd for d ∈ NI . It is enough to prove that
U′ = U. We argue by induction on the (partial) degeneration order on the set of
orbits. Let m be a multipartition and assume that fm′ ∈ U′ for all m′ 6= m such
that Om′ ⊂ Om . Pick x ∈ Om and define dimension vectors d(t) , t = 1, . . . , r as in
(1.1). Then from Proposition 1.1. we have
                                                M
                     f dr · · · f d1 ∈ v Z fm ⊕   C[v, v −1 ]fm′
                                               m′ <m
                   ′
and hence fm ∈ U .                                                                   ♦

    The properties of simple perverse sheaves now translate as follows.

Proposition 2.3. The canonical basis element bm is characterized by the two
conditions
      i) bm = bm , L
     ii) bm ∈ fm ⊕ m′ <m vC[v]fm′ .

                                                                                                   ♦


                  3. Hall algebras and symmetric functions
                                                         (1)                    (1)
3.1. In this section we assume that ∆ = ∆1 and set U1 = UModk (∆) . In that
case, the set of isomorphism classes of objects in M odk (∆) is in natural bijection
with the set Π of all partitions, and we will denote by the same letter λ the isoclass
corresponding to a partition λ.

3.2. Let Γ = C[x1 , x2 , . . .]S∞ be Macdonald’s ring of symmetric polynomials in
infinitely many variables. This ring is equipped with various bases. Following
classical notations, we denote by pλ the power-sum symmetric function, by eλ the
elementary symmetric function, and by sλ the Schur function.

Theorem 3.1 ([Hal]). The assignement f(1r ) 7→ er extends to an isomorphism of
               (1) ∼
algebras φ : U1 → Γ ⊗C C[v, v −1 ]. Moreover, φ(fλ ) = Pλ (v 2 ) where Pλ is the
Hall-Littlewood polynomial.

  Now let us consider the scalar product h , iG . From the above theorem one can
deduce by direct computation :

Proposition 3.1. The scalar product h , i = φ∗ h , iG coincides with the Hall-
Littlewood scalar product :
                                                                  1
                                    hpλ , pµ i = δλ,µ zλ Q                  ,
                                                             i (1 − v 2λi )
                          Q
where z(1m1 2m2 ··· ) =       i   mi !imi .

                                                                                            (1)
   Observe that the form h , i on K0 (C) vanishes here. It follows that U1                        can
itself be equipped with a coproduct by the formula
                          X                        |Aut(M )| · |Aut(N )| P
         ∆0 ([P ]) =               v −d(M)·d(N )                        FM,N [M ] ⊗ [N ].
                                                        |Aut(P )|
                       [M],[N ]

From Green’s theorem (Theorem 2.1) and the above proposition we see that φ :
  (1) ∼
U1 → Γ ⊗C C[v, v −1 ] is an isomorphism of bialgebras, where Γ ⊗C C[v, v −1 ] is
equipped with Zelevinsky’s coproduct (see [Z2]).
  Finally, the canonical basis also admits a nice interpretation in terms of sym-
metric functions :

Proposition 3.2 ([Lu1]). We have φ(bλ ) = sλ . Hence φ(b∗λ ) = Sλ (v) where Sλ (v)
is the dual Schur function.

    We will give a geometric interpretation of the above theorem in Section 7.

                      4. Hall algebras and quantum groups
4.1. Let A = (aij )i=1,...,r be a symmetric generalized Cartan matrix. Associated to
A is a complex Kac-Moody algebra g with a Cartan decomposition g = n− ⊕ h⊕ n+ .
The quantized enveloping algebra Uv (g) of g is the C(v)-algebra generated by
elements Ei , Fi , Ki±1 for i = 1, . . . , r satisfying the relations
                       Ki Ki−1 = Ki−1 Ki = 1,                Ki Kj = Kj Ki ,
                                                                                        Ki − Ki−1

The Lusztig integral form UA (g) is the C[v, v −1 ]-subalgebra generated by Ei , Fj
and Ki±1 for i = 1, . . . , r and k ≥ 1. The above algebras are equipped with a Hopf
algebra structure with a coproduct
∆(Ki ) = Ki ⊗ Ki ,         ∆(Ei ) = Ei ⊗ Ki + 1 ⊗ Ei ,                   ∆(Fi ) = Fi ⊗ 1 + Ki−1 ⊗ Fi .
                                                                                    (k)
We will denote by U−
                   A (g) ⊂ UA (g) the subalgebra generated by Fi                          for i = 1, . . . , r
and k ≥ 1.
. To an arbitrary quiver Q with vertex set I and edge set Ω is associated a Cartan
matrix A as above : we put r = |I| and let aij be the number of (unoriented) edges
                                                                                (1)
between i and j. In particular, ∆n corresponds to the Lie algebra sln+1 while ∆n
                                      b n (for n > 1).
corresponds to the affine Lie algebra sl

4.2. Let us first assume that ∆ = ∆n and set Un = UModk (∆n ) . In that case we
have the following theorem of Ringel :

extends to an isomorphism of algebras φ : U−
                                           A (sln+1 ) → Un .


                                                                     (1)            (1)
4.3. For the rest of this section we assume that ∆ = ∆n and set Un = UMod (∆(1) ) .
                                                                                k    n

The map φ defined above gives rise to an embedding U−      ( b n ) → U(1)

longer surjective (this can easily be checked by comparing graded dimensions). Let
                        (1)
us denote by Cn ⊂ Un the image of φ. We first give a description of Cn .
. Recall that the set of isomorphism classes of objects in C is indexed by (ordered)
n-tuples of partitions m = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(n) ). Call such a multipartition aperiodic if,
for every k > 0 there exists a least one i such that k is not a part of λ(i) . Let
us denote by M the set of all multipartitions and by Map the subset of aperiodic
multipartitions.
Theorem 4.2 ([Lu4]). We have
                                           M
                                Cn =               C[v, v −1 ]bm .

4.4. Let us call a multipartition m = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(n) ) completely periodic if we
have λ(1) = . . . = λ(n) , and let Mper ⊂ M be the set of all such multipartitions.
Consider the space
                                     M
                               K=         C[v, v −1 ]b∗m .
                                   m∈Mper

Observe that K has nonzero terms only in periodic degrees d = (d, . . . , d) (and
hence it is in fact Z-graded).
Theorem 4.3 ([S1]). The following holds :
                                        (1)
     i) K is a central subalgebra of Un ,
    ii) The multiplication map induces an isomorphism of algebras
                               K ⊗C[v,v−1 ] Cn → U(1)
                                                  n ,

    iii) The algebra K is stable under the involution u 7→ u and, as a Z-graded
         algebra, K ≃ C[v, v −1 ][z1 , z2 , . . .] where deg (zl ) = l for l ≥ 1.
                                                            (1)
   Observe that if n = 1 then Cn is not defined and U1 = K. Part iii) of the
above theorem can then be deduced from Theorem 3.1 and the well-known fact
that Γ ≃ C[z1 , z2 , . . .] as a Z-graded algebra. However, we will see that, as in the
case n = 1, there is for every n a geometrically defined canonical identification
K ≃ Γ ⊗ C[v, v −1 ].
                                                                  (1)
                                                                   b
Remarks. i) Theorem 4.3 can be reinterpreted as follows : Un ≃ U−
                                                                A (gln ) where
b
gln is defined as the (universal) central extension
                                   b → gl [z, z −1] → 0.
                          0 → Cc → gln   n

The algebra K is then the quantum analogue of the algebra generated by xz k for
k ≥ 1, where x ∈ Z(gln ).
                                                                  (1)
    ii) The algebra K admits another description. Let e′i ∈ End(Un ) be the adjoint
(under h , iG ) of the left multiplication by Fi (the Kashiwara operator familiar in
crystal graph theory, see e.g. [HK]). Then K = ∩i Ker e′i . In particular, K
                                                                           (1)
corresponds to the “highest weight” subspace (of the crystal graph of Un ) with
respect to the action of the quantum group UA (sl    b n ). The above results are in
accordance with (and were partly motivated by) [LTV] where the crystal graph of
   (1)
Un was completely described, and found to be a disjoint union of copies of the
crystal graph of U−      b
                     A (sln ) indexed by partitions.
                                                (1)
    iii) In the limit n → ∞ the diagrams An and An tend to the common limit
A∞∞ (i.e. the quiver with vertex set I + Z and edge set Ω = {(i, i + 1)}). In that
              (1)
situation, U∞ = U∞ = C∞ = U−         A (sl∞ ).
    iv) Ringel also studied a “degenerate” version of the Hall algebra where one
considers representations of the given quiver over C and uses an Euler characteristic
analogue of the convolution product (2.1). This yields a construction of the Lie
algebra of sln or glb n rather than of the quantum group (see [Ri3]).

                    5. Flag varieties and Hecke algebras
   In this section we (brielfly) introduce and fix some notation for the more classical
geometric objects in type A representation theory such as (partial, affine) flag
varieties, (affine) Hecke algebras and some related algebras. Good references for
these are [G3] or [CG].

the simple reflections, so that Sr may be presented as the group generated by
si , i = 1, . . . , r − 1 with relations
(5.1)                     s2i = 1,        si sj = sj si for i 6= j ± 1,


(5.2)                                si si+1 si = si+1 si si+1 .
The extended affine symmetric group is S      b r = Sr ⋉Zr . It is isomorphic to the group
generated by si for i ∈ Z/rZ and τ subject to the relations (5.1), (5.2), τ r = 1 and
τ si = si+1 τ .
As usual we will denote by l : Sr → N and l : S        b r → N the length functions. By
definition, we have l(si ) = 1 and l(τ ) = 0.
                                                 P
. Now fix d = (d1 , . . . , dn ) ∈ Nn such that i di = r. Associated to d are parabolic
subgroups Sd ⊂ Sr and S          bd ⊂ Sb r generated by si for i 6∈ {d1 , d1 + d2 , · · · , d1 +
                               b
· · · + dn }. Observe that Sd is always finite.

5.2. Let k be either Fq or Fq Let L be an r-dimensional k-vector space. We denote
by B the variety of all complete flags
                       0 = L0 ⊂ L1 · · · ⊂ Lr = L,             dim Li = i
(a smooth projective variety). The group GL(L) acts transitively on B. The set of
GL(L)-orbits on B × B is in bijection with the symmetric group Sr . For w ∈ Sr
we denote by Ow the corresponding orbit.
. Alternatively, we may fix one flag (Li )i ∈ B and denote by B ⊂ GL(L) its
stabilizer (a Borel subgroup). This provides us with an identification B ≃ GL(L)/B.
The set of B-orbits on B is also in natural bijection with Sr and we denote by Bw
the orbit corresponding to w (a Schubert cell). It is known that dim Bw = l(w).
                                                             P
. Now let n ∈ N and fix d = (d1 , . . . , dn ) ∈ Nn such that i di = r. Let Fd be the
variety of n-step partial flags
                 0 = L0 ⊂ L1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Ln = L,              dim Li /Li−1 = di .
This is again a smooth projective variety. As above, let (Li )i be a fixed flag in Fd
and let P ⊂ GL(L) be its stabilizer (a parabolic subgroup). This identifies Fd with
GL(L)/P . The P -orbits on Fd are now parametrized by double cosets Sd \Sr /Sd .
We again denote by Fd,w the orbit corresponding to w ∈ Sd \Sr /Sd (a generalized
Schubert cell).
. The Zariski closures Bw or Fd,w of Schubert cells are called Schubert varieties.

5.3. We consider an affine analogue of the above notions. Set L = k r ((z)). By
definition, a lattice in L is a free k[[z]]-submodule L ⊂ L of rank r. Let G denote
the variety of all lattices. This infinite-dimensional space is a countable union of
(finite-dimensional) smooth projective varieties ( indeed, let us fix one lattice L0 ;
then for every l ∈ N let Xl ⊂ G be the smooth projective, finite-dimensional variety
of lattices L with z l L0 ⊂ L ⊂ z −l L0 ; we have Xl ⊂ Xl+1 and G = ∪l Xl .).
. Now let X be the variety of all infinite flags of lattices · · · ⊂ Li ⊂ Li+1 ⊂ · · · such
that dimk Li+1 /Li = 1 and which satisfy the periodicity condition Li+r = z −1 Li .
This is again a union of finite-dimensional smooth projective varieties. The map
X → G, (Li ) 7→ L0 is a smooth locally trivial B-fibration. The group GLk((z)) (L)
acts transitively on X and the set of GLk((z)) (L)-orbits on X × X is in natural

bijection with S  b r : for j ∈ Z/rZ, sj corresponds to the orbit consisting of pairs
((Li ), (Li )) such that Li = L′i for all i 6≡ j (mod r); the orbit {((Li ), (L′i )) |Li =
          ′

L′i+1 ∀ i} corresponds to τ . For any w ∈ S     b r we will write Ow for the associated
orbit in X × X .
   As in Section 5.2, we may also fix a flag (Li ) ∈ X and denote by I ⊂ GLk((z)) (L)
its stabilizer (an Iwahori subgroup). This identifies X with GLk((z)) (L)/I. The set
of I-orbits on X is also in natural bijection with S   b r and we will denote by Xw the
                                    b
orbits corresponding to w ∈ Sr (an affine Schubert cell). As in the finite type case,
we have dim Xw = l(w).
                                                       P
. Finally, let d = (d1 , . . . , dn ) ∈ Nn be such that i di = r. We set
        Yd = {(Li ) |Li ⊂ Li+1 ,        dimk Li /Li−1 = di mod n ,     Li+n = z −1 Li }.
As before, there is a (noncanonical) indentification Yd ≃ GLk((z)) (L)/P for some
(parahoric) subgroup P ; the P -orbits Yw on Yd are indexed by elements w ∈
b d \S
S    b r /S
          b d (see [Lu3] for a formula for dim Yw ).

                                                                 b r ) as the unital
5.4. Define the Hecke algebra Hr (resp. the affine Hecke algebra H

C[v, v ]-algebra generated by elements Tw , w ∈ Sr (resp. w ∈ Sr ) satisfying the
following relations
                        Tw Tw′ = Tww′         if l(ww′ ) = l(w) + l(w′ ),
                          (Tsi + 1)(Tsi − v −2 ) = 0, for all i.
We set T̃w = v   l(w)                               b
                  Tw for every w ∈ Sr (resp. w ∈ Sr ).
  In the case of an affine Hecke algebra, there is another very useful presentation,
due to Bernstein.
Theorem 5.1 (see [Lu5]). The algebra H      b r is isomorphic to the algebra generated
     ±1                           ±1
by Ti , i = 1, . . . , r − 1 and Xj , j = 1, . . . , r with relations
            Ti Ti−1 = 1 = Ti−1 Ti ,                  (Ti + 1)(Ti − v −2 ) = 0,
            Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 ,              |i − j| > 1 ⇒ Ti Tj = Tj Ti ,
            Xi Xi−1     =1=   Xi−1   Xi ,            Xi Xj = Xj Xi ,
            Ti Xi Ti = v −2 Xi+1 ,                   j 6= i, i + 1 ⇒ Xj Ti = Ti Xj .
    The isomorphism between the two presentations is such that Tsi →                7    Ti and
T̃λ−1 7→ X1λ1 · · · Xrλr if λ = (λ1 , . . . , λr ) ∈ Zr is dominant, i.e if λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λr .
The center of H   b r is Z(H b r ) = C[v, v −1 ][X ±1 , . . . , Xr±1 ]Sr .
                                                     1


. The relevance of Hecke algebras for us and the link with the previous paragraphs
comes from the following geometric construction. Let us assume that k = Fq . Let
us set G = GLk((z)) (L) and denote by CG [X × X ] the space of G-invariant functions
whose supports lie on a finite union of orbits. We equip CG [X × X ] with the algebra
structure given by the convolution product
                                f ⋆ g = p13! (p∗12 (f ) · p∗23 (g))
where pij : X × X × X → X × X is the projection on the ith and jth components.
Observe that this product is well-defined since for any two orbits Ow , Ow′ , the
projection p13 : (Ow × X ) ∩ (X × Ow′ ) → X × X is proper.

     In the next theorem, we specialize the Hecke algebra by setting v −2 = q.

Theorem 5.2 ([IM]). The assignement Tw 7→ 1Ow defines an isomorphism of
         b r ≃ CG [X × X ].
algebras H


. It follows from the above Theorem that the structure constants for the convolution
algebra CG [X × X ] are polynomials in q. Hence we may (and we will) consider the
convolution algebra as a C[v, v −1 ]-algebra.
  Naturally, the same result holds in the case of the usual flag variety B, and we
obtain in this way a geometric construction of the finite Hecke algebra Hr .

5.5. Let us now consider parabolic analogues of the constructions in the previous
paragraph. We again assume that k = Fq . Let us set
                                          Y = ⊔d Yd ,
                                                                                 P
where in the sum d runs over all sequences (d1 , . . . , dn ) ∈ Nn satisfying         di = r.
   The group G = GLk((z)) (L) acts on Y × Y. It is easy to check that the G-orbits
                           b d \S
in Yd × Yd′ are indexed by S    b r /S
                                     b d′ . Without risk of confusion, we denote by
Ow ⊂ Yd × Yd the orbit corresponding to w.

. For w ∈ S b d \S    b d′ , we set Tw = P
                 b r /S                                        b ′    b
                                             δ∈w Tδ and we let Hdd ⊂ Hr be the

                                                                         b d Tδ .
      b           b
Then Hdd′ = ed Hr ed′ . Put                 M
                                    b n,r =
                                    S         Hb dd′ .
                                              d,d′
We equip this space with the multiplication
                                                      b dc′

                                            b r by Sr , we obtain the definition of
. Of course, replacing everwhere Y by F and S
the algebra Sn,r .

  In the next theorem, we specialize the Hecke algebra by setting v −2 = q.
Theorem 5.3 ([VV1]). The linear map S   b n,r → CG [Y × Y] such that Tw 7→ 1Ow is
an algebra isomorphism.
  Again a similar result holds in the finite type case. Finally, as in Section 5.4, we
deduce from the above Theorem that CG [Y × Y] is naturally a C[v, v −1 ]-algebra.

5.6. As for Hall algebras, there is a construction of the Hecke algebras involving
(complexes of) equivariant constructible sheaves, rather than G-invariant functions.
We will not need such a construction and refer to e.g. [G3] or [V2] for details.
A consequence of this construction is the existence of canonical bases for these
algebras, which we now define.
          b r . We put
  Let w ∈ S
                              X
                       cw =         v −i+l(w)−l(x) dim HX
                                                        i
                                                          x
                                                            (ICXw )T̃x
                              i,x

where ICXw denotes the intersection cohomology complex associated to CXw and
where Hi stands for local cohomology. The elements {cw | w ∈ S  b r } form the

. Similarly, fix d, d′ and let w ∈ Sb d \S
                                         b r /S
                                              b d′ . Let Ld be any point in Yd and denote
by Yw,d the fiber above Ld of the projection of Ow → Yd on the first component.
This is an algebraic variety of dimension y(w), say (an explicit formula for y(w)
can be found in [Lu3]). For every w ∈ S      b d \S
                                                  b r /S

. In addition, as for Hall algebras, there is a purely algebraic characterization of
the elements of the canonical bases of the algebras Hr and Sn,r .

     Let us first consider the semilinear involution u 7→ u of H                    w −1 .

                                                x<w

   The polynomial Px,w (v) is the affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of type Ãr−1
associated to w and x
   Similarly, define a semilinear involution τ : H   b dd′ → H  b dd′ by τ (u) = v −2l(wd′ ) u
where wd′ ∈ S    b d′ is the longest element. The previous theorem generalizes as
follows.
Theorem 5.5. For each w ∈ S        b d \S
                                        b r /S
                                             b d′ the element cw is uniquely determined
by the properties :

                                                x<w


. Again, we have given the results in the affine case but they are all valid in the
finite type case as well.

               6. Canonical bases and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials
   We now give the fundamental constructions (due to Lusztig and Zelevinsky)
relating representations of quivers of type A to flag varieties. In particular, this
will identify the coefficients of the transition matrix between the canonical basis
{bm } and the PBW basis {fm } with Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. The strategy
is as follows : we construct a compactification of an orbit closure Om which is a
(generalized) Schubert variety, in such a way that the stratification by Schubert
cells restricts on Om to the stratification by Gd -orbits and use Theorem 5.4. In
this section, k = C or k = Fq .

                                                                          n
                        P finite type case. Let d = (d1 , . . . , dn ) ∈ N be a dimension
6.1. Let us first treat the
vector, and let us set     di = r and
                                          M                  M
                      Vi = k di ,   Vi =     Vj ,    L=            Vi .
                                                j≤i                  i
           i
Then (V ) is a partial flag belonging to Fd . Let us denote by P ⊂ GL(L) its
stabilizer. We construct a map ι : E(d) → Fd as follows. To a representation
(φi ) ∈ E(d) we associate the flag defined by
               Ui = {(x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vn |xj+1 = φj (xj ) for j ≥ i}.
       QUIVERS OF TYPE A, FLAG VARIETIES AND REPRESENTATION THEORY                   13


Proposition 6.1 ([Z1]). The map ι is an embedding of E(d) as a dense open subset
of the (generalized) Schubert variety
                        Fw0 := {(Ui ) | Ui ⊃ V i−1       for all i}.
Moreover, each Gd -orbit Om ⊂ E(d) embeds as a dense open subset of a P -orbit
Fw(m) for some w(m) ∈ Sd \Sr /Sd .
Proof. It is clear that ι(E(d)) ⊂ Fw0 . Conversely,
                                        L           it is easy to see that (Ui ) ∈ Fw0
belongs to ι(E(d)) if and only if Ui ∩ j>i Vj = 0 for all i (an open condition).
Finally note that Gd embeds as a Levi subgroup of P and that ι is Gd -equivariant.
♦

Remark. Let U ⊂ Fw0 be any P -orbit and pick (Ui ) ∈ U. Then
                     (Ui /V i−1 , φi = Id : Ui /V i−1 → Ui+1 /V i )
defines a representation of ∆n . Let m be the multipartition describing this rep-
resentation. It is easy to check that ι(Om ) ⊂ U. In particular, the assignement
m 7→ w(m) is a bijection between the set of Gd -orbits in E(d) and the set of
P -orbits (or Schubert cells) in Fw0 .

. Now let us fix Om ⊂ E(d). By the previous Proposition, the simple perverse sheaf
ICOm is the restriction to Om of the simple perverse sheaf ICFw . In particular,
                                                                              0
for any On ⊂ Om we have

                                                    (ICFw(m) ).
Next, consider the natural map π : B ≃ G/B → G/P ≃ Fd given by
           (0 = U0 ⊂ U1 · · · ⊂ Ur = L) 7→ (Ud1 ⊂ Ud1 +d2 ⊂ · · · Ur = L).
This is a locally trivial fibration with smooth projective fiber P/B. Thus, for any
w1 , w2 ∈ Sd \Sr /Sd there holds
                      i
                 dim HF w1
                           (ICFw2 ) = dim Hπi −1 (Fw ) (ICπ−1 (Fw2 ) ).
                                                         1

Finally, π −1 (Fw ) = ⊔y∈w By (a finite union of B-orbits). Since Fw is irreducible,
there exists a unique open B-orbit Byw in π −1 (Fw ) (corresponding to the longest
element y(w) ∈ w). Thus we obtain

                     i
                dim HO n
                         (ICOm ) =dim Hπi −1 (Fw(n) ) (ICπ−1 (Fw(m) ) )

                                    =dim HB y(w(n))
                                                    (ICBy(w(m)) ).
Corollary 6.1. The coefficients of the transition matrix between the canonical
basis {bm } and the PBW basis {fm } of Un are Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials (of
type AP di −1 ), where d is determined by m via Ø(m) ⊂ Ed .


6.2. Let us now briefly describe the affine analogue of the above

is due to Lusztig. Let d = (d1 , . . . , dn ) ∈ Nn and set r =     di . For clarity,
                                                                            L        we
denote by i ∈ Z/nZ the class of an integer i ∈ Z. Set Vi = k di , L = i Vi and
L = L((z)). Let · · · ⊂ L0 ⊂ L1 ⊂ · · · be the n-periodic flag of lattices defined by
                                      L0 = L[[z]],

Let P ⊂ GLk((z)) (L) be its stabilizer. We construct a map E(d) → Yd as follows :
let 0 ≤ i < n be the residue of i modulo n and set l(j) = (j − j)/n; let (φi ) ∈ E(d)
and set                              (
                                       φi    if i 6= 0
                               φ̃i =    −1
                                       z φi if i = 0,
and φh (xi ) = φ̃i+h · · · φ̃i+1 φ̃i (xi ) if xi ∈ Vi . Note that for any fixed xi , φh (xi ) = 0
for h big enough. Now we put ι((φi )) = (Nj ) where Nj = Lj−1 ⊕ z −l(j−1)−1 Uj−1
and                                       X h                   	
                                  Uj =           φ (xj ) |xj ∈ Vj .
                                            h≥0

. Just as in the finite type case, one may prove :
Proposition 6.2 ([Lu3]). The map ι is an embedding of E(d) as a dense open
subset of the (generalized) affine Schubert variety
                          Yw0 := {(Ni ) | Ni ⊃ Li−1         for all i}.
Moreover, each Gd -orbit Om ⊂ E(d) embeds as a dense open subset of a P -orbit
Yw(m) for some w(m) ∈ S  b d \S
                              b r /S
                                   b d.

Corollary 6.2. The coefficients of the transition matrix between the canonical basis

{bm } and the PBW basis {fm } of Un are affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials (of
      (1)
type AP di −1 ).


Remark. Nakajima constructed in [N3] a similar compactification of E(d) for an
arbitrary quiver. However, it is only in type A that the coefficients of the canon-
ical basis are given by Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials (see, however [BZ2] for some
descriptions of singularities of orbit closures in type D in terms of products of
Grassmanians).

              7. Schur-Weyl duality in the geometric setting
7.1. Let us first briefly recall the usual Schur-Weyl duality. Let V be an n-
dimensional C-vector space. There are two commuting group actions on V ⊗r :
GL(V ) acts diagonally while Sr acts by permutation of the factors. Moreover we
have
                       C[Sr ] = EndGL(V ) (V ⊗r ) if n ≥ r,
                             U (gl(V )) ։ EndSr (V ⊗r )
                         ⊗r
The algebra EndSr (V ) is called the Schur algebra. There are affine and quantum
                                                                             bn =
versions of this duality. The affine version is obtained by replacing gln by gl
         −1                                    b
gln [z, z ] ⊕ Cc, the symmetric group Sr by Sr and V by V [z, z ].−1


. In the quantum version, we replace gln by the quantum group Uv (gln ). Recall
that this is the C(v)-Hopf algebra generated by elements Ei , Fi , i = 1, . . . , n − 1
and Hi±1 , i = 1, . . . , n satisfying relations
                       Hi Hi−1 = Hi−1 Hi = 1,            Hi Hj = Hj Hi ,
                                    aij
                       Hi Ej = v          Ej Hi ,   Hi Fj = v −aij Fj Hi ,
                                                   −1
                                             Hi Hi+1  − Hi−1 Hi+1
                              [Ei , Fj ] = δij                     ,
                                                    v − v −1
                          [Ei , Ej ] = [Fi , Fj ] = 0 if |i − j| > 1,
      (2)                          (2)       (2)                    (2)

where (aij ) is the Cartan matrix of type An−1 . The coproduct is defined as in
Section 4.1.
   The standard representation Cn of gln admits a quantization Vq (the “vector”
representation). Using the coproduct ∆ we define an action of Uv (gln ) on Vq⊗r .
It is well-known that Uv (gln ) is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra, i.e there exists an
element R ∈ Uv (gln ) ⊗ Uv (gln ) satisfying the relation R∆ = ∆op R. From this
we construct an action of the Artin braid group on r strands Br on Vq⊗r by the
formula
              σi (v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr ) = v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ P R(vi ⊗ vi+1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr ,
where σi is the ith standard generator of Br and P : u⊗v 7→ v⊗u is the permutation
(see e.g [ES] for more details on quasitriangular Hopf algebras). One shows that the
action of Br factorizes through the Hecke algebra Hr , and that, as in the classical
case, we have

                         Hr = EndUv (gln ) (Vq⊗r )      if n ≥ r,
                                Uv (gln ) ։   EndHr (Vq⊗r )
The algebra   EndHr (Vq⊗r )   is called the q-Schur algebra.
. Finally, the quantum affine version is now obtained by replacing Uv (gln ) by
     b ), the space Vq by its affine version Vq [z, z −1 ], and Hr by H
Uv (gl                                                                     b r . However,
       n
there is a subtle point here: Uv (glb n ) is the quantization of gln [z, z ] ⊕ Cc rather
                                                                          −1

than the quantization of the Kac-Moody algebra sl       b n or the quantization of the
                          b ′             L       l
slightly bigger algebra gln := gln ⊕ l∈Z∗ z sln ⊕ Cc (unfortunately, this latter
                               b n in the litterature). In particular, the Hopf algebra
algebra is often also denoted gl
     b
Uv (gln ) is best defined through the Drinfeld new realization (see [D]) rather than
through quantum Serre-type relations. We refer to [GV] for the precise definition.

Remark. In the affine versions of the Schur-Weyl duality, the modules V [z, z −1 ]
and Vq [z, z −1 ] are of level zero, i.e the central element c (or its quantum analog)
act trivially. Thus, for the purposes of Schur-Weyl duality it is enough to consider
the loop algebra Lgln = gln [z, z −1] or its quantization.

7.2. Following Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson in the finite-type case and Ginzburg-
Vasserot and Lusztig in the affine case, we will now give a geometric construction
of the (quantum) Schur-Weyl dualities. We assume here that k = Fq .

. Recall the notations of Section 5 : L is a fixed r-dimensional k-vector space, B
the flag variety and F = ⊔d Fd the n-step partial flag variety. For any i = 1, . . . , n
we consider the subvarieties of F × F
        Oi+ = {((Lj ), (L′j )) |Lj = L′j if j 6= i and L′i ⊂ Li , dim Li /L′i = 1},

        Oi− = {((Lj ), (L′j )) |Lj = L′j if j 6= i and Li ⊂ L′i , dim L′i /Li = 1},
and for any d we set Od0 = ∆Fd ⊂ Fd × Fd .
                                                                               P

. Next we consider the affine case. Thus dim L = r, L = L((z)), X is the affine flag
variety and Y is the affine n-step partial flag variety. Again we set
        Oi+ = {((Lj ), (L′j )) |Lj = L′j if j 6= i and L′i ⊂ Li , dimk Li /L′i = 1},
        Oi− = {((Lj ), (L′j )) |Lj = L′j if j 6= i and Li ⊂ L′i , dimk L′i /Li = 1},
and Od0 = ∆Yd ⊂ Yd × Yd .
Theorem 7.2 ([GV], [Lu4]). There exists a surjective algebra homomorphism
                              b ) → CG [Y × Y] ⊗C[v,v−1 ] C(v).

. We are now ready to give the geometric version of Schur-Weyl duality. The con-
volution product defines a left action of CG [F × F] on CG [F × B] and a right action
of CG [B × B] on CG [F × B]. Moreover, it is clear that these two actions commute.
Recall the algebra Sn,r = CG [F × F] defined in Section 5.

                                          Sn,r ≃ EndHr (Vq⊗r )
and an isomorphism of Sn,r − Hr -bimodules CG [F × B] ≃ Vq⊗r such that the fol-
lowing diagram commutes

7.3. Using a combination of the constructions in Sections 6 and 7, we can give a
conceptual interpretation of Theorem 4.3. Put

            i∈Z/nZ i  /L i using  the natural  maps φi : Li /L′i → Li+1 /L′i+1 (as in

condition for affine flags. For a multipartition m we denote by Zm ⊂ O− the set of

   This can be viewed as a generalization of the Hall-Littlewood scalar product.

these bases (see [VV1], [SV]).

   8. Representation theory of Hecke algebras and quantum affine
                 algebras and graded nilpotent orbits
. This survey would be very incomplete without mentioning a totally different aspect
of quivers of type A and their canonical bases, namely their interpretations as
Grothendieck rings of finite-dimensional modules for an affine Hecke algebra and
for an affine q-Schur algebra.

8.1. We will first deal with Hecke algebras. We make a few preliminary defi-
nitions and remarks. Since Z(H    b r ) = C[v, v −1 ][X ±1 , . . . , X ±1 ]Sr , any character
                                                          1            r
θ : Z(H b r ) → C is given by an r + 1-tuple (s1 , . . . , sr ; ǫ) such that θ(xi ) = si and
                 ∗

θ(v) = ǫ. It is convenient to view such an r + 1-tuple as a pair (s, ǫ) ∈ T × C∗ where
T ⊂ GLr (C) is the subgroup of diagonal matrices. Note that θ determines s only
up to conjugation (i.e permutation). By Schur’s lemma, Z(H           b r ) acts by a character
in any simple finite-dimensional module. Let us denote by Repθ (H            b r ) the category
of finite-dimensional Hb r -modules of central character θ.
                                            b r and quivers of type A stems from
. The link between representation theory of H
the following fundamental theorem.
Theorem 8.1 ([KL3],[G1]). Fix θ = (s, ǫ) and assume that ǫ is not a root of unity.
Set Gs = StabGLr (C) s. There is a bijection between the set of simple modules in
     b r and the set of Gs -orbits in
Repθ H
                      Nθ = {x ∈ glr , x nilpotent, sxs−1 = ǫ−2 x}.
. The proof of the above theorem (the so-called Deligne-Langlands conjecture for
Hb r ) is based on a geometric realization of H
                                              b r completely different from the one
given in Section 5, as the Grothendieck group of (equivariant) coherent sheaves on
a certain variety Z ⊂ T ∗ B × T ∗ B (see [CG],[KL3]). As a part of this realization,
two types of modules are constructed for each triple (s, ǫ, x) : the simple module
Lθ,x and the so-called standard module Mθ,x , whose character is easy to compute.
The determination of the characters of the simple modules is now a consequence of
the following result.
Theorem 8.2. Let θ = (s, ǫ) and assume that ǫ is not a root of unity. For each
x ∈ Nθ we set Ox = Gs · x. Then for any two x, y ∈ Nθ the multiplicity of Lθ,x in
Mθ,y is
                                      X
                                              k
                     [Mθ,x : Lθ,y ] =   dim HO  y
                                                  (ICOx ).
                                             k



. Let us reinterpret the above Theorems in terms of quivers Am . Let us fix ǫ (the
value of the deformation parameter v). For simplicity, let us denote by Repǫ H      br
the category of all finite-dimensional modules ofLcentral charge θ = (s, ǫ) with
Spec(s) ⊂ ǫ2Z . For any such s, write Cr =         i∈Z Vǫ2i for the corresponding
eigenspace decomposition of Cr . Now observe that x(Vǫ2i ) ⊂ Vǫ2i−2 , i.e x is nothing
but a representation on the space Cr of the quiver A∞ ∞ . Let m(s, x) be the type
of this representation. Altogether, Theorems 8.1 and 8.2 are nicely summarized as
follows.
Corollary 8.1 ([A]). Assume that ǫ is not a root of unity. There exists a linear
isomorphism
                            M               ∼
                       Θ∞ :            b r) →
                                Rep∗ǫ (H      U∞,|v=1
                                     r
such that Θ∞ ([Mθ,x ]∗ ) = fm(s,x) and Θ∞ ([Lθ,x]∗ ) = bm(s,x) .


Remark. The above Theorem together with the results of Section 6 shows that,
in particular, the multiplicities [Mθ,x : Lθ,y ] are equal to evaluation at 1 of some
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of type A.

. The case when ǫ2 is a primitive nth root of unity is more subtle. In that situation,
Theorem 8.2 remains true while in Theorem 8.1 only a certain subset of Gs -orbits in
Nθ is relevant. Observe that now if Spec(s) ⊂ ǫ2Z then to a pair (s, x) is associated
                                         (1)
a representation of the cyclic quiver An rather than A∞     ∞ . The classification of
simple modules is best described by the next theorem.
Corollary 8.2 ([A],[Gro]). Assume that ǫ2 is a primitive nth root of unity. There
exists a linear isomorphism
                          M            ∼              (1)
                     Θn :         b r) →
                            Rep∗ (H      Cn,|v=1 ⊂ U
                                       ǫ                      n,|v=1
                              r

such that Θ∞ ([Lθ,x ]∗ ) = bm(s,x) .
                                        b r ) are indexed by aperiodic multiparti-
. In particular, simple modules in Repǫ(H
tions of total dimension r.
Remark. i) Ariki proved much more than the results stated above : he endowed
           L         ∗ b
the space       r Repǫ (Hr ) with an algebra structure (using the restriction functor
Repǫ (Hb r+r′ ) → Repǫ (Hb r ) ⊗ Repǫ (H
                                       b r′ )) and showed that the map Θ is actually an
algebra homomorphism.
ii) A consequence of the above Theorem and of the results in Section 6 is that the
multiplicities [Mθ,x : Lθ,y ] are now given by evaluation at 1 of affine Kazhdan-
Lysztig polynomials of type A.
iii) Recently, Vasserot succeeded in extending some of the above results to the case
of a double affine Hecke algebra, or Cherednik algebra [V3].

8.2. Let us now turn to the case of the quantum affine algebra Uv (slb k ). It is known
                                                   b
that any finite-dimensional representation of Uv (slk ) factors through S b k,r for some
r ≫ 0. Hence, by Schur-Weyl duality we expect a very similar classification result
                                               b k,r in the same spirit as [G1], [KL3]
as in Section 8.1. A geometric construction of S
was given in [GV].
Theorem 8.3 ([GV]). Let ǫ ∈ C∗ . There is a bijection between the simple finite-
                           b ) and the set of pairs
dimensional modules of Uǫ (gl k

              {(s, x) |s ∈ T, x ∈ glr , xk = 0, sxs−1 = ǫ−2 x}/GLr (C).
To each such pair is associated a simple module Ls,x and a standard module Ms,x ,
and we have                                   X
                                                     l
                     [Ms,x : Ls′ ,y ] = δs,s′   dim HO y
                                                         (ICOx )
                                               l
where Oz is the Gs -orbit containing z.
. In particular, the classification of simple modules can again be interpreted in terms
of quivers of type A. However, observe that, as opposed to Section 8.1., there are
no additional restrictions when ǫ is a root of unity. Let Repǫ (Uv (sl     b k )) denote
the category of all finite-dimensional modules with a composition series involving
only simple modules Ls,x with Spec(s) ⊂ ǫ2Z . For notational convenience, we set
  (1)
A∞ = A∞   ∞ in what follows.

Corollary 8.3 ([VV1]). Let n ∈ N ∪ {∞} be the order of ǫ2 . There exists a linear
isomorphism                M                    ∼
                                         b k )) →  (1)
                      Ξn :    Rep∗ǫ (Uv (sl       Un,|v=1
                                  k
such that Ξn ([Mθ,x ]∗ ) = fm(s,x) and Ξn ([Lθ,x ]∗ ) = bm(s,x) .

Remark. i) Again, the standard modules Ms,x can be explicitly described and
their characters computed (see [V1]). Also, as for Hecke algebras, the multiplicities
[Mθ,x : Lθ,y ] are evaluation at 1 of some Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials (affine if ǫ
is a root of unity).

. One may ask for a similar interpretation for Grothendieck groups of categories of
representations of Uǫ (slk ) or Hr . Although no geometric constructions similar to
those in [KL3] or [GV] exist for the finite type quantum group or Hecke algebra,
there exist evaluation maps ev : Uv (sl b k ) → Uv (slk ), ev : H
                                                                b r → Hr . These in
                      ∗         ∗     b
turn induce maps ev : Repǫ (Uv (slk )) → Repǫ (Uv (slk )) and ev ∗ Rep∗ǫ (H
                                                  ∗                         b r) →
     ∗
Repǫ (Hr ). In fact these maps nicely fit in the previous picture, as shown by the
following theorems.
Theorem 8.4 ([A],[VV1]). Let n ∈ N ∪ {∞} be the order of ǫ2 . There is a com-
mutative diagram
                 L     ∗ b         ∼    / Cn,v=1 ⊂ U(1)
                  r Repǫ (Hr )     Θ         n
                                                     n|v=1

                       ev ∗                                      γ

                   L                                        
                          ∗                 ∼
                    r Repǫ (Hr )

                                            θn

where VΛ0 is the highest-weight integrable representation of Cn ≃ U−  b
                                                                   v (sln ), and γ
is the action on the highest weight vector.
Theorem 8.5 ([VV1]). Let n ∈ N∪{∞} be the order of ǫ2 . There is a commutative
diagram
                 L        ∗      b      ∼       / U(1)
                     k Repǫ (Uv (slk )) Ξ         n
                                                   n|v=1

                              ev ∗                                       γ

where Λ∞ is the Fock space representation of Un constructed in [Hay], [VV1], and
γ is the action on the vacuum vector of Λ∞ .
. In addition, the spaces VΛ0 and Λ∞ are again equipped with two bases: a “canon-
ical basis” and a “PBW basis”. These correspond, under the isomorphisms θn
and ξn to the (dual) bases of simple modules and standard modules respectively.
Finally, the map γ is compatible with these canonical bases.
. This beautiful interpretation of character formulae in terms of canonical bases
of Hall algebras and Fock spaces or highest weight representations was first con-
jectured by Lascoux-Leclerc-Thibon in [LLT]. It was proved by Ariki for Hecke
algebras (in the more general framework of cyclotomic Hecke algebras, which in-
clude in particular Hecke algebras of type B) and by Varagnolo and Vasserot for
quantum affine algebras. One nice consequence of this construction for quantum
affine algebras is that it gives a new proof of Lusztig’s conjecture for the characters
of simple Uǫ (slk )-modules when ǫ is a root of unity.

                 9. Some further geometric constructions
. To conclude this survey, we briefly mention some other interesting occurences of
quivers of type A in geometry.

9.1.Nakajima quiver varieties. Nakajima recently introduced a new class of
algebraic varieties and convolution algebras which play an increasingly important
role in geometric representation theory (see [Nak1],[Nak3]). These varieties are
defined for an arbitrary quiver, but they have a special interpretation for affine (or
finite) Dynkin diagrams as moduli spaces of sheaves on complex surfaces.
. Let us consider the action of the cyclic group Γ = Z/nZ on C2 via the embedding
                                Z/nZ → SL(2, C)
                                               
                                        ζ     0
                                   1 7→ n
                                         0 ζn−1
where ζn is a primitive nth root of unity. This action extends to a natural ac-
tion on P2 (C), leaving the projective line at infinity l∞ invariant. The McKay
correspondence gives a bijection between the set of irreducible Γ-modules and the
                                                         (1)
set of simple roots (vertices) of the Dynkin diagram An−1 . Hence, we may iden-
tify the Grothendieck (semi)group K0 (Rep Γ) with the set of dimension vectors
      (1)
of ∆n . Now let v, w be two such dimension vectors, and let V , W be corre-
sponding Γ-modules. The (smooth) Nakajima quiver variety M(v, w) associated
      (1)
to ∆n is the moduli space of pairs (E, φ) where E is a Γ-equivariant torsion-
                                                                      ∼
free sheaf on P2 (C) such that H 1 (P2 , E(−l∞ )) ≃ V and φ : E∞ → Ol∞ ⊗ W is
a Γ-invariant isomorphism. Let Mvec (v, w) ⊂ M(v, w) be the subvariety con-
sisiting of pairs (E, φ) where E is a vector bundle. The singular Nakajima vari-
ety is defined as M0 (v, w) = Mvec (v, w) × (SC2 )Γ . There is a projective map
π : M(v, w) → M0 (v, w) given by (E, φ) 7→ (E ⋆⋆ , φ, supp(E ⋆⋆ /E)).
. In the McKay correspondence, the extending vertex of the affine Dynkin diagram
is associated to the trivial representation ρ0 . The quiver varieties M(v, w) and
M0 (v, w) for ∆n−1 are defined just as in the affine case with the added condition
that V and W do not contain ρ0 .

. Remarkably, the above geometrically defined varieties also admit a very concrete
                                                                             (1)
realization in terms of quivers (for arbitrary type). We give it for type An−1 , the
finite type being (as above) obtained from it as a particular case. Let us consider
                       (1)
the double quiver of ∆n , where each arrow is replaced by a pair of arrows going in
opposite directions. Let H be the set of oriented edges of this graph. For any h ∈ H
we denote by o(h) and i(h) the outgoing and incoming edges of h respectively. Let
(v, w) ∈ Nn ×Nn withL  v = (va )a∈Z/nZLand w = (wa )a∈Z/nZ . Fix some Z/nZ-graded
C-vector spaces V =      Va and W =      Wa such that dim V = v and dim W = w.
Set                                   M
                           E(V, V ) =     Hom(Vo(h) , Vi(h) ),
                                     h∈H
                       M                                     M
          L(V, W ) =       Hom(Vk , Wk ),       L(W, V ) =       Hom(Wk , Vk )
                       k                                     k
and
                  M(v, w) = E(V, V ) ⊕ L(W, V ) ⊕ L(V, W ).
An element of M(v, w) will usually be denoted by its components (B, i, j).

. Let ǫ : H → {1, −1} be any function satisfying ǫ(h) + ǫ(h) = 0, where h is the
edge h with opposite orientation. Consider the subvariety
                                         X
      M0 (v, w) = {(B, i, j) ∈ M(v, w) |     ǫ(h)Bh Bh + ik jk = 0 for all k}.

                   Q
The group GV = k GL(Vk ) acts on M0 (v, w) by conjugation. The quiver varieties
are obtained as quotients of the variety by GV . According to the Geometric Invari-
ant Theory philosophy, there are essentially two ways of doing this. Define an ele-
ment (B, i, j) to be semistable
                       L        if the following condition holds : the only B-invariant,
graded subspace S ⊂       Vk contained in Ker j is {0}. Let M0,ss (v, w) ⊂ M0 (v, w)
denote the open subvariety of semistable points.
Theorem 9.1 ([N1], [VV2]). We have M0 (v, w) = M0 (v, w)//GV (categorical
quotient) and M(v, w) = M0,ss (v, w)/GV (geometric quotient).


. Quite remarkably, in type A the quiver varieties are again related to partial flag
varieties. Let us consider the case of the quiver ∆n . Let v, w be n-tuples of positive
integers, and define another n-tuple a as follows :
                     a1 = w1 + · · · + wn−1 − v1 ,      an = vn−1 ,

             ai = wi + · · · + wn−1 − vi + vi−1 ,     for i = 2, . . . , n − 1.
Behold the partial flag variety
          Fa = {U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Un−1 ⊂ Cr | dim Ui /Ui−1 = ai },
         P
where r = i ai . The cotangent bundle T ∗ (Fa ) can be identified with the variety
of pairs
                        {((Ui ), x) |x(Ui ) ⊂ Ui+1 } ⊂ Fa × N ,
where N ⊂ glr denotes the set of nilpotent elements. It is known that the image
of the natural projection p : T ∗ Fa → N is the Zariski closure of one orbit, say Oa .
. Now let y ∈ N be a nilpotent element with wi Jordan blocks of length i and let
z, h ∈ glr be such that (y, h, z) is an sl2 -triple. The Slodowy slice at y is defined as
                            Sy = {u ∈ N |[u − y, z] = 0}.
The variety Sy is transverse to all nilpotent orbits containing y in their closure, and
plays an important role in the Brieskorn-Slodowy approach to Kleinian singularities.
The following was conjectured by Nakajima and proved by Maffei [M].
Theorem 9.2. We have
                                  M0 (v, w) ≃ Sy ∩ Oa
and
                         M(v, w) ≃ p−1 (Sy ∩ Oa ) ⊂ T ∗ Fa .


. We note that a similar link between quiver varieties and transversal slices to nilpo-
tent orbits appears in [MV], and is related there to some infinite Grassmannians.

9.2.Parabolic structures. Let k be an algebraically closed field and let X be
a curve defined over k. If x ∈ X is a smooth point then the category of torsion
sheaves (or skyscraper sheaves) on X supported at x is equivalent to the category of
finite-dimensional representations of the local ring Ox at x. Since this is a discrete
                                                        (1)
valuation ring, this category is equivalent to M odk (∆1 ). In particular, the Hall
algebra of the category of coherent sheaves on X (over Fq ) contains a copy of
   (1)
U1 ≃ Γ ⊗ C[v, v −1 ] at each (smooth) point.

. Now let us assume in addition that X is endowed with an action of the cyclic
group G = Z/nZ, and that x is an isolated fixed point for this action. Hence G
acts on Ox as i · f = ζni f , where ζn = e2iπ/n . In that situation, the category of
                                                                        (1)
G-equivariant torsion sheaves supported at x is equivalent to M odk (∆n ).
. Finally, let us consider the case of a finite group G acting on X, and let π : X →
X/G ≃ Y denote the quotient map. Assume that this map is ramified at points
y1 , . . . , yr with ramification indices p1 , . . . , pr . Then, locally over each yi we are
in the situation just described with G = Z/di Z. In particular, the category of G-
                                                                          (1)
equivariant coherent sheaves on X contains a copy of M odk (∆di ) for each i. This
has applications in [S3] to the study of Hall algebras of such categories (see also
[GL]).

. Closely related to the above is the notion of parabolic structure. Let X be a curve
and let x ∈ X be a smooth point. A p-parabolic structure at x on a coherent sheaf
F on X is a flag of coherent sheaves
                               F = F0 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fp = F (−x).
Note that if F is locally free at x then we have an induced filtration
                           (F /F0 )|x ⊂ · · · ⊂ (Fp /F0 )|x ≃ F|x ,
i.e a parabolic flag in the fiber of F at x. This notion can be seen as some global-
ization of the concept of an affine flag as in Section 5. In [FK] the authors consider
a similar situation in the case of a surface : using a variant of the Hall algebra, they
construct an action of glb on the cohomology of certain moduli spaces of coherent
                          p
sheaves on surfaces with p-parabolic structure along a rational curve.
