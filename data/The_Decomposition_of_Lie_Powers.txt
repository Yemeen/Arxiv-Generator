                                             Let G be a group, F a field of prime characteristic p and V a finite-dimensional F G-
                                             module. Let L(V ) denote the free Lie algebra on V regarded as an F G-submodule of the
                                             free associative algebra (or tensor algebra) T (V ). For each positive integer r, let Lr (V )
                                             and T r (V ) be the rth homogeneous components of L(V ) and T (V ), respectively. Here
                                             Lr (V ) is called the rth Lie power of V . Our main result is that there are submodules
                                             B1 , B2 , . . . of L(V ) such that, for all r, Br is a direct summand of T r (V ) and, whenever
                                             m > 0 and k is not divisible by p,
                                                            mk           m              m−1
                                                       Lp        (V ) = Lp (Bk ) ⊕ Lp         (Bpk ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ Lp (Bpm−1 k ) ⊕ L1 (Bpm k ).

                                             Thus every Lie power is a direct sum of Lie powers of p-power degree. The approach
                                             builds on an analysis of T r (V ) as a bimodule for G and the Solomon descent algebra.




                                                                                        1. Introduction

                                             Let G be a group and F a field. For any finite-dimensional F G-module V let
                                             L(V ) be the free Lie algebra on V . Then L(V ) may be regarded as an F G-module
                                             on which each element of G acts as a Lie algebra automorphism. Furthermore,
                                             each homogeneous component Lr (V ) is a finite-dimensional submodule, called the
                                             rth Lie power of V . We regard L(V ) as an F G-submodule of the free associative
                                             algebra, or tensor algebra, T (V ). Thus Lr (V ) is a submodule of T r (V ).
                                                 In characteristic 0, the structure of Lr (V ) has been clarified by a number of
                                             papers, including those of Brandt [3], Klyachko [19], and Kraskiewicz and Weyman
                                             [20]. We concentrate here on the more difficult case where F has prime character-
                                             istic p. When r is not divisible by p, Lr (V ) is comparatively well understood. In
                                                 Research of second author supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Scho-799).

                                                                                                  1
this case, Lr (V ) is a direct summand of T r (V ) (that is, Lr (V ) has a complement
in T r (V )) and it is possible to exploit knowledge of T r (V ). For example, when F
is infinite and G is the general linear group on V , the indecomposable summands
of Lr (V ), for r not divisible by p, were described up to isomorphism by Donkin
and Erdmann [13].
    The first case beyond this, namely the case r = p, was studied by Bryant and
Stöhr [10], by means of a detailed analysis of T p (V ). Further progress was made by
Erdmann and Schocker [14] who studied the case r = pk where k is not divisible by
p. Their methods make substantial use of Solomon’s descent algebra, showing that
its significance for free Lie algebras goes beyond the case of characteristic 0. Their
main results are concerned with the relationship between Lpk (V ) and Lk (V ). As
a consequence, they were able to prove the factorisation Φpk     p      k
                                                          F G = ΦF G ◦ ΦF G for the

“Lie resolvents” introduced by Bryant [4]. Such factorisations, for certain groups
G, first appeared in [5] and [6]. It follows from the results of [14] that the study of
Lpk (V ) can be reduced, broadly speaking, to the study of Lp (Lk (V )). As we have
already seen, Lk (V ) is comparatively well understood. Thus the study of pkth Lie
powers is reduced, in a sense, to the study of pth Lie powers.
    This theme is developed a great deal further in the present paper. We show
that the study of arbitrary Lie powers may be reduced, in the same sense, to the
study of Lie powers of p-power degree.
    First we develop some aspects of the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt Theorem. Linked
with this theorem there is a filtration of T r (V ) by F G-submodules in which the
factors are isomorphic to certain tensor products of symmetric powers of Lie powers
of V , called “higher Lie modules”. At the bottom of the filtration is Lr (V ) and,
at the top, the rth symmetric power S r (V ). Several papers on free Lie algebras
([10], for example) have used this filtration to study Lr (V ), exploiting the fact
that T r (V ) is comparatively well understood. The weakness of this method is that
the filtration has many terms.
    Our first result, called the “Filtration Theorem” and proved in §3, does some-
thing to remedy this weakness. We show that the filtration can be modified by
means of primitive idempotents of the modular descent algebra. It turns out that
T r (V ) splits up as a direct sum of F G-submodules each with a much shorter

                                          2
filtration than before. The summands of T r (V ) correspond to the primitive idem-
potents, and these are indexed by the “p-equivalence classes” of partitions of r.
    In §4, we prove our main result about free Lie algebras, called the “Decom-
position Theorem”. This reduces the study of arbitrary Lie powers to the study
of Lie powers of p-power degree and may be stated as follows. Let F be a field of
characteristic p. Let G be a group and let V be a finite-dimensional F G-module.
Then, for each positive integer r, there is a submodule Br of Lr (V ) such that Br
is a direct summand of T r (V ) and, for k not divisible by p and m > 0,

                     mk           m              m−1
                Lp        (V ) = Lp (Bk ) ⊕ Lp         (Bpk ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ L1 (Bpm k ).

This has to be interpreted with a little care. As we shall see in §2, the subalgebra of
L(V ) generated by Br is free on Br . It may therefore be identified with L(Br ) and
then we have Li (Br ) ⊆ Lir (V ) for all i. The proof of the Decomposition Theorem
uses the Filtration Theorem of §3 as well as Lazard’s “Elimination Theorem” (see
§2 below). This last result has proved to be fundamental in the theory and has
been repeatedly used in earlier work such as [7].
    In another paper [9] we shall obtain further information about the isomorphism
types of the modules Br and we shall show that the Decomposition Theorem yields
                                          m            m
the factorisation of Lie resolvents ΦpF Gk = ΦpF G ◦ ΦkF G for every non-negative integer
m and every positive integer k not divisible by p.




                                      2. Preliminaries

    We shall require some technical variations on known material concerned with
free Lie algebras and representations of the general linear group. These are col-
lected together in the present section.
    We first work over a ring R which is allowed to be either the ring of integers or
an arbitrary field. (This is simply a sufficient degree of generality for our purposes.)
Let V be a free R-module. We write T (V ) for the free associative R-algebra (with
identity element) freely generated by any R-basis of V . Thus T (V ) has an R-
                                L       r                         r
module decomposition T (V ) =      r>0 T (V ) where, for each r, T (V ) is the rth

homogeneous component of T (V ) and we identify T 1 (V ) with V . Each T r (V ) is

                                                 3
a free R-module and T r (V ) ∼
                             = V ⊗R · · · ⊗R V , with r factors. We call T r (V ) the
rth tensor power of V . Note, however, that we write ab rather than a ⊗ b for the
product of elements a and b of T (V ). For a ∈ T r (V ) we write deg a = r.
    The algebra T (V ) may be made into a Lie R-algebra by means of the bracket
operation given by [a, b] = ab − ba. The Lie subalgebra of T (V ) generated by V is
denoted by L(V ). By a theorem of Witt (see [18] for the case of a field and [2] for
general R), L(V ) is a free Lie R-algebra, freely generated by any basis of V , and
T (V ) is the enveloping algebra of L(V ). For r > 1, we write Lr (V ) = T r (V )∩L(V ).
                 L       r              1                   r
Thus L(V ) =        r>1 L (V ), where L (V ) = V . Each L (V ) is a free R-module,

called the rth Lie power of V .
    Let S(V ) denote the free commutative associative R-algebra (that is, poly-
nomial ring) freely generated by any R-basis of V . Then, as for T (V ), we have
         L      r             r
S(V ) =    r>0 S (V ). Each S (V ) is a free R-module called the rth symmetric

power of V .
    When V has finite rank then T r (V ), Lr (V ) and S r (V ) also have finite rank.
    Suppose that G is a group and that the free R-module V is a (right) RG-
module. The action of G on V extends to T (V ) so that G acts by algebra auto-
morphisms. Thus T (V ) becomes an RG-module. The subspaces L(V ), T r (V ) and
Lr (V ) are G-invariant, so they also become RG-modules. Similarly, S(V ) and the
subspaces S r (V ) can be given the structure of RG-modules.
    We now consider the case R = F , where F is a field. Suppose that B is a
subspace of T r (V ) for some r > 1. Then it is easily verified that the subalgebra of
T (V ) generated by B is isomorphic to T (B) and may be identified with T (B) by
means of an isomorphism which is the identity on B. Then T i (B) ⊆ T ir (V ) for all
i > 0. Furthermore, if B ⊆ Lr (V ) then the Lie subalgebra of L(V ) generated by
B is equal to the subalgebra L(B) of T (B) as previously defined. Thus it is a free
Lie algebra. Furthermore, Li (B) ⊆ Lir (V ) for all i > 1. This is the justification
for the notation used in the Decomposition Theorem as stated in §1.
    If L is a free Lie algebra over F and W is a subspace of L such that some basis
(equivalently, every basis) of W is a free generating set of L then we say (with
slight abuse of language) that L is free on W or that L is freely generated by W .
In this case L is isomorphic to L(W ).

                                           4
    If L is a free Lie algebra over F and Q is a subalgebra of L then, by the
theorem of Shirshov and Witt (see [21, Theorem 2.5]), Q is free (on some free
generating set). If W is a subspace of L then the subalgebra of L generated by W
is not necessarily free on W (though it is free on some subspace). If this subalgebra
is free on W we write it as L(W ). Indeed we identify the subalgebra generated by
W with L(W ) by means of the isomorphism which is the identity on W .
    The following result is essentially well known and is given as [8, Lemma 1].

    Lemma 2.1. Let L be a free Lie algebra over F and, for each r > 1, let Lr be
the rth homogeneous component of L with respect to a given free generating set.
Let Q be a subalgebra of L of the form Q = Q1 ⊕ Q2 ⊕ · · · with Qr = Q ∩ Lr for all
r. For each r > 1, let Q(r) denote the subalgebra of Q generated by Q1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Qr ,
and write Q(0) = 0. For each r > 1, let Wr be any subspace of Qr satisfying
Qr = (Q(r − 1) ∩ Qr ) ⊕ Wr . Then Q is free on W1 ⊕ W2 ⊕ · · · , that is,

                               Q = L(W1 ⊕ W2 ⊕ · · ·).



    For subspaces B and C of any Lie algebra over F , let C ≀B denote the subspace
defined by
                       C ≀ B = C + [C, B] + [C, B, B] + · · · .

(We use the left-normed convention for Lie products.) The following lemma is a
version of Lazard’s “Elimination Theorem” (see [2, Chapter 2, §2.9, Proposition
10]). In the form written here it is a special case (with trivial group action) of [7,
Lemma 2.2] or [8, Lemma 2].

    Lemma 2.2. Let B and C be F -spaces, and consider the free Lie algebra
L(B ⊕ C). Then B and C ≀ B freely generate subalgebras L(B) and L(C ≀ B), and
there is an F -space decomposition L(B ⊕ C) = L(B) ⊕ L(C ≀ B). Furthermore,

                       C ≀ B = C ⊕ [C, B] ⊕ [C, B, B] ⊕ · · ·

and, for each n > 0, there is an F -space isomorphism
                                            ∼
                                            =
                      ζn : [C, B, . . . , B ] −→ C ⊗ |B ⊗ ·{z
                                                            · · ⊗ B}
                               | {z }
                                   n                        n


                                            5
such that ζn ([c, b1 , . . . , bn ]) = c ⊗ b1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ bn for all c ∈ C and b1 , . . . , bn ∈ B.

    Corollary 2.3. Suppose, in Lemma 2.2, that C is the direct sum of sub-
           L                   L
spaces, C = i Xi . Then C ≀ B = i (Xi ≀ B) and, for each i,

                             Xi ≀ B = Xi ⊕ [Xi , B] ⊕ [Xi , B, B] ⊕ · · · .

Furthermore, for each n, ζn restricts to an isomorphism

                                                     ∼
                                                     =
                                                                   · · ⊗ B} .
                               [Xi , B, . . . , B ] −→ Xi ⊗ |B ⊗ ·{z
                                     | {z }
                                           n                                   n



      We next consider Schur algebras for the general linear group. Basically, we
follow [16], but we adapt the treatment there to allow the underlying field to be
finite or infinite. Details omitted in our treatment can be found in [16] or are
straightforward modifications of what can be found there. As before, R is either
the ring of integers or an arbitrary field.
      Let n and r be positive integers. Let I(n, r) be the set of all ordered r-tuples
i = (i1 , . . . , ir ) where i1 , . . . , ir ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
      Let AR (n, r) be the homogeneous component of degree r in the polynomial
ring over R in n2 indeterminates cij (1 6 i, j 6 n). Thus AR (n, r) has an R-basis
consisting of the monomials of degree r. For i, j ∈ I(n, r) where i = (i1 , . . . , ir ),
j = (j1 , . . . , jr ), we write ci, j for the monomial ci1 j1 · · · cir jr . The ci, j are not distinct
(when n, r > 1) but they give a basis (with repetitions) of AR (n, r).
      Let SR (n, r) = HomR (AR (n, r), R). Thus SR (n, r) has an R-basis (with rep-
etitions) consisting of the elements ξi, j (i, j ∈ I(n, r)) where ξi, j (ci, j ) = 1 and
ξi, j (ci′ , j′ ) = 0 if ci′ , j′ 6= ci, j . Multiplication in SR (n, r) may be defined as in [16,
§2.3]: for ξ, η ∈ SR (n, r),
                                                      X
                                   (ξη)(ci, j ) =                ξ(ci,k)η(ck, j ).
                                                    k∈I(n,r)


Thus SR (n, r) becomes an associative R-algebra with identity element. This is the
Schur algebra of degree r. As in [16, (2.3b)] there are equations
                                                           X
                                            ξi, j ξk,l =         zs,t ξs,t ,

                                                           6
where the zs,t are non-negative integers depending on i, j, k, l but independent of R.
When we need to show the role of R we write ξi,Rj instead of ξi, j . We may identify
SR (n, r) with R ⊗Z SZ (n, r) by identifying ξi,Rj with 1 ⊗ ξi,Z j for all i, j. If E is a
field containing R we may regard SR (n, r) as a subring of SE (n, r) by identifying
ξi,Rj with ξi,Ej . We may also identify SE (n, r) with E ⊗R SR (n, r).
    For w ∈ AR (n, r) and g = (gij ) ∈ GL(n, R) we write w(g) for the element of R
obtained from w by evaluating cij as gij for all i, j. We write e(g) for the element
of SR (n, r) given by e(g)(w) = w(g) for all w ∈ AR (n, r). Then, as in [16, §2.4], e
extends to an algebra homomorphism

                             e : RGL(n, R) −→ SR (n, r).                            (2.1)

This is surjective if R is an infinite field, by [16, (2.4b)].
    We shall consider right modules for RGL(n, R) and SR (n, r), whereas [16] has
left modules. This leads only to minor, mainly notational, differences. Suppose
that U is an SR (n, r)-module which is free of finite rank as an R-module. Then
U may be regarded as an RGL(n, R)-module by means of e, and such RGL(n, R)-
modules are called polynomial modules of degree r. If U has R-basis {u1 , . . . , ud }
then there are uniquely determined elements wst (1 6 s, t 6 d) of AR (n, r) such
that, for all ξ ∈ SR (n, r) and all s,
                                           X
                                  us ξ =           ξ(wst)ut .                       (2.2)
                                           t

These polynomials wst are called the coefficient polynomials (with respect to the
given basis). For all g ∈ GL(n, R) we also have
                                       X

If R = E, where E is an infinite field, then the coefficient polynomials are uniquely
determined by the equations (2.3) and the existence of such polynomials for an
EGL(n, E)-module U implies that U is a polynomial module of degree r.
    References for basic facts about polynomial modules are only conveniently
available when R is an infinite field. Thus the following result is often useful.

    Lemma 2.4. Let U be an RGL(n, R)-module with R-basis {u1, . . . , ud }. Let
E be an infinite field containing R. Then U is a polynomial module of degree r if

                                               7
and only if E ⊗R U is a polynomial EGL(n, E)-module which restricts to give U,
on taking U ⊆ E ⊗R U and GL(n, R) ⊆ GL(n, E), and such that the coefficient
polynomials for E ⊗R U with respect to {u1 , . . . , ud} belong to AR (n, r).

    Proof. (Sketch.) Suppose that E ⊗R U has the given properties with coefficient
polynomials wst ∈ AR (n, r). By (2.2), U is invariant under the action of SR (n, r).
Conversely, if U is an SR (n, r)-module with coefficient polynomials wst then (2.2)
holds for E ⊗R U because it holds for U.                                                    

    Let V be a free R-module of rank n with basis {x1 , . . . , xn }. The iden-
tity representation GL(n, R) → GL(n, R) gives V the structure of the “natural”
RGL(n, R)-module. It is easy to check (by Lemma 2.4, for example) that V is
an SR (n, 1)-module. Indeed the coefficient polynomials are given by wij = cij for
all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. For every positive integer r, T r (V ), Lr (V ) and S r (V ) are
RGL(n, R)-modules as we saw earlier in this section. By Lemma 2.4, they are
SR (n, r)-modules. In §3 we shall consider RGL(n, R)-modules of the form

               S m(1) (L1 (V )) ⊗R S m(2) (L2 (V )) ⊗R · · · ⊗R S m(r) (Lr (V )),

where m(1) + 2m(2) + · · · + rm(r) = r. Again they are SR (n, r)-modules.
    From now on in this section we consider only the case R = F where F is a
field (finite or infinite). Thus V is an n-dimensional vector space over F .
    For i ∈ I(n, r) where i = (i1 , . . . , ir ), write xi = xi1 · · · xir ∈ T r (V ). Thus the
elements xi form a basis of T r (V ). The action of SF (n, r) on T r (V ) is given by
[16, (2.6a)]. Translating to right modules we have
                                        X
                                 xi ξ =   ξ(ci, j )xj ,                                  (2.4)
                                             j

for all ξ ∈ SF (n, r).
    Let Λ(n, r) be the set of all n-tuples α = (α1 , . . . , αn ) of non-negative in-
tegers satisfying α1 + · · · + αn = r. For each such α take i ∈ I(n, r) so that
cα111 cα222 · · · cαnnn = ci,i and write ξα = ξi,i. Thus (see [16, §2.3 and §3.2]) the elements
ξα are pairwise orthogonal idempotents of SF (n, r) which sum to the identity. It
follows that if W is any SF (n, r)-module then
                                       M
                                 W =         W ξα ,                                      (2.5)
                                           α∈Λ(n,r)


                                                 8
where the W ξα are subspaces, called weight spaces.
     The multidegree of a monomial xi1 · · · xir of T r (V ) is defined to be the element
α = (α1 , . . . , αn ) of Λ(n, r) such that, for j = 1, . . . , n, αj is the number of values
of t such that it = j. An element of T r (V ) is said to be multihomogeneous if it is
a linear combination of monomials of the same multidegree.
     By (2.4), the action of ξα on T r (V ) is given by
                                
                                  xi1 · · · xir if xi1 · · · xir has multidegree α
           (xi1 · · · xir )ξα =                                                                (2.6)
                                  0             otherwise.

     Thus, if W is an SF (n, r)-submodule of T r (V ), the weight space W ξα , as in
(2.5), consists of multihomogeneous elements of multidegree α.
     We shall need to consider SF (n, r)-submodules of T r (V ) as n varies. Thus, let
V (ω) be a vector space over F with countably infinite basis {x1 , x2 , . . .}. For each
positive integer n, let V (n) be the subspace with basis {x1 , . . . , xn } and identify
T (V (n) ) with a subalgebra of T (V (ω) ) in the obvious way. Also, for each n, regard
V (n) as the natural F GL(n, F )-module. Thus T r (V (n) ) is an SF (n, r)-module.
     Let n1 and n2 be positive integers with n1 6 n2 . Thus I(n1 , r) ⊆ I(n2 , r).
For i, j ∈ I(n1 , r) we may identify ci, j in AF (n1 , r) with ci, j in AF (n2 , r) to make
AF (n1 , r) a subspace of AF (n2 , r). Similarly, by identifying elements ξi, j , we make
SF (n1 , r) a subspace of SF (n2 , r). It is easy to verify that SF (n1 , r) is a subalgebra
of SF (n2 , r) (though the identity elements are different if n1 < n2 ). We may also
take Λ(n1 , r) ⊆ Λ(n2 , r) by identifying (α1 , . . . , αn1 ) with (α1 , . . . , αn1 , 0, . . . , 0).
                                                                                L
    Let W be an SF (n2 , r)-submodule of T r (V (n2 ) ). Thus W = α∈Λ(n2 ,r) W ξα .
The truncation function dn2 ,n1 of [16, §6.5] gives
                                                       M
                                  dn2 ,n1 (W ) =                W ξα ,
                                                   α∈Λ(n1 ,r)


and dn2 ,n1 (W ) is an SF (n1 , r)-submodule of T r (V (n1 ) ). Another point of view is
useful. Let δn2 ,n1 : T (V (n2 ) ) → T (V (n1 ) ) be the algebra homomorphism defined by
                                      
                                        xi for i ∈ {1, . . . , n1 }
                      δn2 ,n1 (xi ) =
                                        0 for i ∈ {n1 + 1, . . . , n2 }.

Then it is easily verified, by (2.6), that

                          δn2 ,n1 (W ) = dn2 ,n1 (W ) = W ∩ T (V (n1 ) ).

                                                   9
     Let {W (n) : n ∈ N} be a family of subspaces of T (V (ω) ). (We write N
for the set of all positive integers.) We say that {W (n) } is a uniform family
of modules of degree r if W (n) is an SF (n, r)-submodule of T r (V (n) ) for all n
and δn2 ,n1 (W (n2 ) ) = W (n1 ) for all n1 , n2 with n2 > n1 . For example, the family
{T r (V (n) )} is a uniform family of modules of degree r.

     Lemma 2.5. Let W be an SF (r, r)-submodule of T r (V (r) ). Then there exists
a unique uniform family {W (n) } of modules of degree r such that W (r) = W .

     Proof. Suppose that n > r. We let the symmetric group Sym(n) act on the
right as a group of automorphisms of T (V (n) ) by extension of its right permutation
action on {x1 , . . . , xn }. For π ∈ Sym(n) and i ∈ I(n, r), where i = (i1 , . . . , ir ), we
write iπ = (i1 π, . . . , ir π). Also, we identify π with the corresponding permutation
matrix in GL(n, F ) and write π̃ for the element of SF (n, r) obtained from π by the
homomorphism (2.1). It is straightforward to verify that in SF (n, r) we have

                            π̃ξi, j = ξiπ−1 , j and ξi, j π̃ = ξi, jπ ,                 (2.7)

for all i, j ∈ I(n, r).
                           P
     We shall show that        π∈Sym(n)   W π is an SF (n, r)-submodule of T r (V (n) ). Let
σ ∈ Sym(n) and i, j ∈ I(n, r). Choose π ∈ Sym(n) so that jπ −1 ∈ I(r, r). By (2.7),

                               σ̃ξi, j = ξiσ−1 , j = ξiσ−1 , jπ−1 π̃.                   (2.8)

For w ∈ W , wξiσ−1 , jπ−1 = 0 if iσ −1 ∈
                                       / I(r, r), by (2.4). However, if iσ −1 ∈ I(r, r),
then ξiσ−1 , jπ−1 ∈ SF (r, r), so wξiσ−1 , jπ−1 ∈ W . Thus, by (2.8), (W σ)ξi, j ⊆ W π.
       P
Hence π∈Sym(n) W π is a submodule of T r (V (n) ).
                                             P
    For n > r we define W (n) =                 π∈Sym(n) W π and for n < r we define

W (n) = δr,n (W ). Then it is straightforward to verify that the family {W (n) } is
unique with the required properties.                                                       

     Lemma 2.6. Let W1 and W2 be submodules of T r (V (r) ) which span their direct

sum, and let {W1 }, {W2 } and {(W1 ⊕ W2 )(n) } be the uniform families given
by Lemma 2.5. Then, for all n,

                                                       (n)        (n)

    Proof. This is straightforward.                                                                          

ules of degrees r1 , . . . , rm , respectively. Then { [W1 , W2 , . . . , Wm ] } is a uni-
form family of modules of degree r1 + · · · + rm .

                                                                             (n)             (n)
    Proof. Let r = r1 + · · · + rm . By Lemma 2.4, [W1 , . . . , Wm ] is an SF (n, r)-
submodule of T r (V (n) ) for all n. Suppose that n1 6 n2 . Then, since, δn2 ,n1 is an
algebra homomorphism,

                     (n2 )                                          (n2 )
          δn2 ,n1 ([W1       , . . . , Wm(n2 ) ]) = [δn2 ,n1 (W1            ), . . . , δn2 ,n1 (Wm(n2 ) )]

                                               = [W1            , . . . , Wm(n1 ) ].

Thus the family is uniform.                                                                                  

    In particular, {Lr (V (n) ) : n ∈ N} is a uniform family of modules of degree r.
    We shall wish to consider arbitrary fields, possibly finite. However, it is often
convenient to pass to the infinite case, so we require some results on field extensions.

    Lemma 2.8. Let F be a field and E an extension field of F . Let A be an
F -algebra and U a finite-dimensional A-module. If E ⊗F U is injective, as an
E ⊗F A-module, then U is injective. If E ⊗F U is projective then U is projective.

    Proof. Suppose that E ⊗ U is injective as an E ⊗ A-module. Then, by [11,
Proposition II.6.2a], E ⊗U is injective as an A-module. But U is a direct summand
of E ⊗ U as an A-module. Hence U is injective. The result for projective modules
is proved in the same way, using [11, Proposition II.6.2].                                                   

    As above, we consider V (n) over an arbitrary field F .

    Lemma 2.9. Suppose that r 6 n and let U be an SF (n, r)-module which is
isomorphic to a direct summand of T r (V (n) ). Then U is injective and projective
as an SF (n, r)-module.

                                                   11
    Proof. Let E be an infinite extension field of F . Thus E ⊗ U is isomorphic
to a direct summand of T r (E ⊗ V (n) ). Since r 6 n, T r (E ⊗ V (n) ) is injective
as an SE (n, r)-module, by [12, (3.4) Lemma]. However, by [16, Example 1 after
(2.7e)], T r (E ⊗ V (n) ) is isomorphic to its contravariant dual. Thus T r (E ⊗ V (n) ) is
projective. It follows that E ⊗ U is injective and projective. Therefore, by Lemma
2.8, U is injective and projective.                                                         

    For positive integers n and r, let Tr          denote the class of all finite-dimensional
SF (n, r)-modules that are direct sums of modules each of which is isomorphic to
a direct summand of T r (V (n) ).

    Lemma 2.10. Let {W (n) } be a uniform family of modules of degree r such that
          (r)
W (r) ∈ Tr . Then, for all n, W (n) is a direct summand of T r (V (n) ).

    Proof. By Lemma 2.9, W (r) is injective. Therefore, since W (r) is a submodule
of T r (V (r) ), it is a direct summand of T r (V (r) ). It follows, by Lemma 2.6, that
W (n) is a direct summand of T r (V (n) ) for all n.                                        




                             3. Filtrations of tensor powers


    As in §2, we first work over a ring R which is either the ring of integers or an
arbitrary field. Let V be a free R-module and let r be a positive integer.
    By a composition of r we mean a sequence λ = (λ1 , . . . , λl ) of positive integers
λ1 , . . . , λl satisfying λ1 + · · · + λl = r. If we also have λ1 > · · · > λl then, as usual,
λ is called a partition of r. If µ = (µ1 , . . . , µl ) is a composition of r and we put
µ1 , . . . , µl into non-increasing order we obtain a partition of r, which we call the
partition associated to µ. We write Part(r) for the set of all partitions of r.
    If λ, θ ∈ Part(r), where λ = (λ1 , . . . , λk ) and θ = (θ1 , . . . , θl ), we say that λ
is a refinement of θ if there is a function f : {1, . . . , k} → {1, . . . , l} such that
      P
θj =     i:f (i)=j λi for j = 1, . . . , l. For example, (3, 2, 2, 2, 1) is a refinement of

(4, 3, 3). The relation of refinement is a partial order on Part(r), and this partial
order plays a key role in the study of filtrations of tensor powers. However, it is

                                              12
more convenient here to work with a total order 6∗ which extends refinement. We
use the “lexicographic” order in which

                                  (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λk ) <∗ (θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θl )

if there exists i such that λi < θi but λj = θj for all j < i. Note that if λ is a
refinement of θ then λ 6∗ θ. Note also that the smallest partition is (1, 1, . . . , 1),
written as (1r ), and the largest partition is (r).
     Our main results are stated in terms of the lexicographic order 6∗ , but similar
results apply for any total order which extends refinement, and more complicated
versions of the results could be stated in terms of refinement itself.
     Let Xr be the set of all elements of T r (V ) of the form b1 b2 · · · bl (l arbitrary)
where each bi belongs to Lµi (V ) for some positive integer µi. Thus µi = deg bi
for all i and (µ1 , . . . , µl ) is a composition of r. For each partition λ of r let Xλ
denote the set of all such elements b1 b2 · · · bl where (deg b1 , . . . , deg bl ) has λ as its
associated partition.
     For each λ, let Wλ be the R-submodule of T r (V ) spanned by all Xθ with
λ 6∗ θ. For each λ such that λ 6= (r) let λ+ be the partition of r which is next
bigger than λ. Thus we have the filtration

                    T r (V ) = W(1r ) > · · · > Wλ > Wλ+ > · · · > W(r) > 0.

We call this the PBW-filtration of T r (V ). (As we shall see it is closely connected
with the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt Theorem.) It is convenient to define W(r)+ = 0.
Thus, for all λ, Xλ spans Wλ modulo Wλ+ .
     The following result is well known and easy to prove using the identity
bi bj = bj bi + [bi , bj ].

     Lemma 3.1. Let µ = (µ1 , . . . , µl ) be a composition of r with associated parti-
tion λ. For i = 1, . . . , l, let bi ∈ Lµi (V ), and let π ∈ Sym(l): thus b1 b2 · · · bl and
b1π b2π · · · blπ belong to Xλ . We have

                              b1 b2 · · · bl + Wλ+ = b1π b2π · · · blπ + Wλ+ .




                                                         13
    For each positive integer i choose an R-basis Ai of Li (V ). The union of these
is an R-basis A of L(V ). Take any total ordering 4 of A. Then, by the Poincaré–
Birkhoff–Witt Theorem (see [18] for the case of a field and [2] for general R), T (V )
has an R-basis F consisting of all elements of the form

              a1 a2 · · · al     (l > 0, a1 , . . . , al ∈ A, a1 4 a2 4 · · · 4 al ).   (3.1)

We call F a PBW-basis of T (V ). Note that the elements (3.1) of F are distinct
as written. We write Fr for the set of all elements (3.1) of degree r. Also, for
each λ ∈ Part(r), we write Fλ for the set of elements (3.1) in Fr such that the
composition (deg a1 , . . . , deg al ) has λ as associated partition. Clearly, Fr is an
R-basis of T r (V ), called a PBW-basis of T r (V ). Also, it is easy to verify, by
Lemma 3.1 and reverse induction on λ (starting with λ = (r)), that the elements
of Fλ taken modulo Wλ+ form an R-basis of Wλ /Wλ+ . (It follows that Wλ > Wλ+
provided that dim V > 1.)
    Suppose that V is an RG-module for some group G. Let λ ∈ Part(r) and
write λ in the form

                               λ = (r m(r) , (r − 1)m(r−1) , . . . , 1m(1) ),

where m(r), . . . , m(1) are non-negative integers. Then we define an RG-module
Lλ (V ) by

         Lλ (V ) = S m(1) (L1 (V )) ⊗R S m(2) (L2 (V )) ⊗R · · · ⊗R S m(r) (Lr (V )).

This is called the higher Lie module corresponding to λ.
    The following result is essentially well known: see, for example, [17, Lemma
3.3]. However, since we have no fully appropriate reference we give a sketch proof.

    Lemma 3.2. Suppose that the free R-module V is an RG-module for some
group G. Then, for each λ ∈ Part(r), Wλ is an RG-submodule of T r (V ) and
Wλ /Wλ+ ∼
        = Lλ (V ).

    Proof. (Sketch.) It is easily verified by reverse induction on λ that Wλ is an
RG-submodule of T r (V ). In the notation used above, choose the ordering of A in
any way so that all elements of Ai are smaller than all elements of Aj whenever

                                                    14
i < j. The basis {w + Wλ+ : w ∈ Fλ } of Wλ /Wλ+ consists of all elements of the
form
                  (1)     (m(1)) (1)         (m(2))
                 a1 · · · a1    a2     · · · a2        · · · a(1)      (m(r))
                                                              r · · · ar      + Wλ+
                                                                          (1)        (m(i))
where the factors are in non-decreasing order and ai , . . . , ai                             ∈ Ai for
i = 1, . . . , r. There is a corresponding basis of Lλ (V ) consisting of the elements

                 (1)      (m(1))       (1)        (m(2))
                a1 · · · a1        ⊗ a2 · · · a2           ⊗ · · · ⊗ a(1)      (m(r))
                                                                      r · · · ar      .

It is easy to verify, by Lemma 3.1, that the R-module isomorphism α that takes
basis element to corresponding basis element is an RG-module isomorphism.                           

                                   = S r (V ) and W(r) ∼
    In particular, W(1r ) /W(1r )+ ∼                   = Lr (V ).
    If V has finite rank n then the isomorphism of Lemma 3.2 is an SR (n, r)-module
isomorphism. This is clear if R is an infinite field (because then the homomorphism
(2.1) is surjective). In the general case, let E be an infinite field containing R. By
Lemma 3.2, Wλ is an RGL(n, R)-submodule of T r (V ). We regard T r (V ) as a
subset of T r (E ⊗ V ) and identify this with E ⊗ T r (V ). It is easily verified that
E ⊗ Wλ is the subspace corresponding to λ in the PBW-filtration of T r (E ⊗ V ).
Thus we may verify by Lemma 2.4 that Wλ is an SR (n, r)-submodule of T r (V ). Let
α be the R-module isomorphism from Wλ /Wλ+ to Lλ (V ) described in the proof of
Lemma 3.2. Upon extension to E, α yields an SE (n, r)-module isomorphism, by
the case first considered. Therefore α is an SR (n, r)-module isomorphism.

    We shall make use of Solomon’s descent algebra. For definitions and further
details see [14, §2] and the works cited there. As well as results from [14] we shall
use a theorem of Garsia and Reutenauer [15]. Our notation is similar to that in
[14, §2]. Let Dr be the descent algebra of Sym(r) over the integers. Thus Dr is a
subalgebra of ZSym(r) and Dr has a Z-basis consisting of certain elements X ν of
ZSym(r) indexed by the compositions ν of r. (In the notation of [15], X ν would
be written as Bν .) The elements X ν can be interpreted as elements of R Sym(r)
and these elements form an R-basis for an R-subalgebra Dr,R of R Sym(r).
    For each composition ν of r, where ν = (ν1 , . . . , νk ), we write φν for the
corresponding Young character of Sym(r). This is the character (in characteristic
0) induced from the trivial character of the group Sym(ν1 )×· · ·×Sym(νk ) regarded

                                                  15
as a subgroup of Sym(r) in the obvious way. The Z-span of the Young characters
is a subring of the ring of all class functions Sym(r) → Z. For each ν, define
φν,R : Sym(r) → R by φν,R (σ) = φν (σ)1R for all σ ∈ Sym(r). Thus the R-span of
the φν,R is a subalgebra Cr,R of the R-algebra of all class functions Sym(r) → R.
For ξ ∈ Cr,R and λ ∈ Part(r) we write ξ(λ) for the value of ξ at the conjugacy
class of Sym(r) indexed by λ. By the same proof as for [14, Theorem 3], there is a
surjective homomorphism of algebras cr,R : Dr,R → Cr,R satisfying cr,R (X ν ) = φν,R
for all compositions ν of r.
     The symmetric group Sym(r) has a left action on T r (V ) by “place permuta-
tions”. This action is given by σ(v1 v2 · · · vr ) = v1σ v2σ · · · vrσ for all σ ∈ Sym(r),
v1 , . . . , vr ∈ V . Thus T r (V ) is an R Sym(r)-module and hence a Dr,R -module.

     Proposition 3.3. For each partition λ of r, Wλ is a Dr,R -submodule of
T r (V ). For all X ∈ Dr,R , the action of X on Wλ /Wλ+ is given by multiplication
by the element (cr,R (X))(λ) of R.

     Proof.     Let µ and ν be compositions of r, where µ = (µ1 , . . . , µl ) and
ν = (ν1 , . . . , νk ). Let Q(ν, µ) be the set of all k-tuples (I1 , . . . , Ik ) where I1 , . . . , Ik
are subsets of {1, . . . , l} such that {1, . . . , l} is the disjoint union of I1 , . . . , Ik and
     P
νj = i∈Ij µi for j = 1, . . . , k. It is easy to verify that |Q(ν, µ)| is the number of
k × l matrices of non-negative integers such that (the l-tuple formed by) the sum
of the rows is µ, the sum of the columns is ν and each column contains a unique
non-zero entry. Therefore, by [1, (12)],

                                         |Q(ν, µ)| = φν (λ),                                     (3.2)

where λ is the partition associated to µ.
     For each q = (I1 , . . . , Ik ) ∈ Q(ν, µ) let πq be the permutation of {1, . . . , l} such
that (1πq , 2πq , . . . , lπq ) consists of the elements of I1 in increasing order followed by
the elements of I2 in increasing order, and so on. For i = 1, . . . , l, let bi ∈ Lµi (V ).
Then, by [15, Theorem 2.1],
                                                      X
                           X ν (b1 b2 · · · bl ) =              b1πq b2πq · · · blπq .           (3.3)
                                                     q∈Q(ν,µ)


                                                      16
Note that this result, as stated in [15], applies only to the case where R = Q and
V has finite rank. However, since (3.3) involves only finitely many elements of V ,
the same result holds for V of infinite rank. From the result over Q we can deduce
the result over Z because, if V is a free Z-module, there are natural embeddings of
T (V ) into T (Q ⊗ V ) and of Dr into Dr,Q . In the case where R is an arbitrary field,
let V have basis {x1 , x2 , . . .}. Both sides of (3.3) are linear in each term bi . Thus it
suffices to prove (3.3) in the case where each bi is a Lie monomial in x1 , x2 , . . . . The
calculation of X ν (b1 b2 · · · bl ) is then the same as it is over Z followed by reduction
modulo the characteristic of R. Thus (3.3) holds in all cases.
    Let λ ∈ Part(r). Then, by (3.3), we have X ν u ∈ Wλ for all u ∈ Xλ and all
compositions ν of r. Thus Xu ∈ Wλ for all X ∈ Dr,R . It follows that each Wλ is a
Dr,R -submodule of T r (V ). Hence Wλ /Wλ+ is a Dr,R -module. Let b1 b2 · · · bl ∈ Xλ ,
with composition µ = (deg b1 , . . . , deg bl ), and let ν be any composition of r. By
(3.3) and Lemma 3.1,

                  X ν (b1 b2 · · · bl ) + Wλ+ = |Q(ν, µ)|b1 b2 · · · bl + Wλ+ .

Thus, by (3.2), the action of X ν on Wλ /Wλ+ is multiplication by the scalar φν (λ)1R .
By the definition of cr,R , this scalar is (cr,R (X ν ))(λ). This holds for all ν, giving
the required result.                                                                     

    From now on in this section we assume that R = F , where F is a field of
prime characteristic p. If λ, θ ∈ Part(r) and σλ and σθ are elements of Sym(r) in
the conjugacy classes corresponding to λ and θ, respectively, then, as in [14, §2],
                                                     s                     s
we say that λ and θ are p-equivalent if σλp is conjugate to σθp for some positive
integer s. This gives an equivalence relation on Part(r). By [14, Proposition 5],
for all ξ ∈ Cr,F we have ξ(λ) = ξ(θ) whenever λ and θ are p-equivalent.
   Let J be the set of all p-equivalence classes of partitions of r. As shown in [14,
                                                                     P
Corollary 6], the identity element 1 of Dr,F can be written as 1 = J∈J eJ , where
the eJ are pairwise-orthogonal primitive idempotents in Dr,F such that cr,F (eJ ) is
given by
                                                 
                                                         1 if λ ∈ J
                             (cr,F (eJ ))(λ) =
                                                         0 if λ ∈
                                                                / J.

                                               17
Therefore, by Proposition 3.3, eJ acts on Wλ /Wλ+ as the identity if λ ∈ J and as
zero otherwise. Thus
                                            
                                                Wλ if λ ∈ J
                          eJ Wλ + Wλ+ =
                                                Wλ+ if λ ∈
                                                         / J.

Also,
               eJ w + Wλ+ = w + Wλ+         for all w ∈ Wλ , where λ ∈ J.          (3.4)

Clearly we obtain a chain of subspaces

        eJ T r (V ) = eJ W(1r ) > · · · > eJ Wλ > eJ Wλ+ > · · · > eJ W(r) > 0.    (3.5)

Note that, since eJ is an idempotent, we have eJ Wλ ∩ Wλ+ = eJ Wλ+ . Thus
eJ Wλ /eJ Wλ+ ∼
              = (eJ Wλ + Wλ+ )/Wλ+ and we have

                          eJ Wλ /eJ Wλ+ ∼
                                        = Wλ /Wλ+ if λ ∈ J,                        (3.6)

while
                              eJ Wλ /eJ Wλ+ = 0 if λ ∈
                                                     / J.                          (3.7)

Therefore, if J = {λ(1), . . . , λ(s)} with λ(1) <∗ · · · <∗ λ(s), we may write the
chain (3.5) in the form

                     eJ T r (V ) = U1 > U2 > · · · > Us > Us+1 = 0,

where Uj /Uj+1 ∼
               = Wλ(j) /Wλ(j)+ for j = 1, . . . , s.
    Suppose that G is a group and V is an F G-module. It is well known and easy
to verify that the actions of Sym(r) and G on T r (V ) commute. It follows that
eJ T r (V ) is an F G-submodule of T r (V ) and the function φJ : T r (V ) → eJ T r (V )
given by w 7→ eJ w for all w ∈ T r (V ) is a homomorphism of F G-modules. By
the properties of the idempotents eJ we see that T r (V ) is the direct sum of the
submodules eJ T r (V ). The chain (3.5) is a filtration of eJ T r (V ) by F G-submodules.
Also, for λ ∈ J, the isomorphism (3.6) is evidently an isomorphism of F G-modules.
In view of Lemma 3.2, we have proved the following result.

    Theorem 3.4 (Filtration Theorem). Let F be a field of prime charac-
teristic p. Let G be a group and V an F G-module. Let eJ , J ∈ J , be primitive
idempotents of the descent algebra as described above. Then the F G-module T r (V )

                                            18
is the direct sum of its submodules eJ T r (V ). For a given J, let λ(1), . . . , λ(s) be
the partitions belonging to J in increasing lexicographic order. Then eJ T r (V ) has
a filtration of F G-submodules,

                     eJ T r (V ) = U1 > U2 > · · · > Us > Us+1 = 0,

where, for j = 1, . . . , s, we have Uj /Uj+1 ∼
                                              = Lλ(j) (V ).

    It is easily seen that if V has finite dimension n then each of the isomorphisms
of Theorem 3.4 is an isomorphism of SF (n, r)-modules.
    Some supplementary details will be important later, so we note them in the
proposition below. For each λ ∈ Part(r), let Yλ be any subset of Wλ such that the
family {y +Wλ+ : y ∈ Yλ } consists of distinct elements forming a basis of Wλ /Wλ+ .
      S
Thus Yλ is a basis of T r (V ). For each λ let Yλ be the subspace of T r (V ) with
                                                                       S
basis Yλ. Let J be a p-equivalence class of partitions of r. Let YJ = λ∈J Yλ and
                                                             L
let YJ be the subspace of T r (V ) with basis YJ . Thus YJ = λ∈J Yλ .

    Proposition 3.5. In the notation above, the function φJ : T r (V ) → eJ T r (V )
given by φJ (w) = eJ w for all w ∈ T r (V ) restricts to a vector space isomorphism
from YJ to eJ T r (V ). Thus eJ YJ is a basis of eJ T r (V ).

    Proof. By (3.7), we have

                             φJ (Wλ ) = φJ (Wλ+ ) if λ ∈
                                                       / J.

Also, since Wλ = Yλ + Wλ+ , we have

                        φJ (Wλ ) ⊆ φJ (YJ ) + φJ (Wλ+ ) if λ ∈ J.

It follows, by reverse induction on λ (starting with λ = (r)), that φJ (Wλ ) ⊆ φJ (YJ )
for all λ. Therefore φJ (T r (V )) ⊆ φJ (YJ ) and so φJ (YJ ) = φJ (T r (V )) = eJ T r (V ).
Thus the restriction φJ : YJ → eJ T r (V ) is surjective. Suppose that y is a non-zero
element of YJ . Then, for some λ ∈ J, we have y ∈ Wλ r Wλ+ . Since eJ acts as
the identity on Wλ /Wλ+ , we have φJ (y) ∈ Wλ r Wλ+ . Thus φJ (y) 6= 0 and so
φJ : YJ → eJ T r (V ) is injective.                                                      

                          4. The Decomposition Theorem

    We begin with a major step towards the proof.

    Proposition 4.1. Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field
F of prime characteristic p. Regard V as the natural F GL(n, F )-module, where
n = dim V . Let q be a positive integer such that q 6 n and write q = pm q ′ where
q ′ is not divisible by p. For each proper divisor d of q, let Bd be an SF (n, d)-
submodule of Ld (V ) such that Bd is a direct summand of T d (V ). Suppose that

                              i ′
                                          M            i ′
                            Lp q (V ) =              Lp q /d (Bd ),
                                          d|pi q ′


for i = 0, . . . , m − 1, and suppose that the modules Lq/d (Bd ), where d runs over
the proper divisors of q, span their direct sum C in Lq (V ). Then Lq (V )/C is
injective and projective as an SF (n, q)-module.

    Note that the notation Lr (Bd ) is justified by the remarks early in §2.

    Proof. We first reduce to the case where F is infinite. Let E be an infinite
extension field of F and identify E ⊗ T (V ) with T (E ⊗ V ). Thus E ⊗ Lr (V )
is identified with Lr (E ⊗ V ) for all r. The modules E ⊗ Bd within T (E ⊗ V )
satisfy the same hypotheses as the modules Bd within T (V ). Suppose that the
proposition holds over E. Then E ⊗ Lq (V )/E ⊗ C is injective and projective as
an SE (n, q)-module. However, this module is isomorphic to E ⊗ (Lq (V )/C) and
we may identify SE (n, q) with E ⊗ SF (n, q). Therefore, by Lemma 2.8, Lq (V )/C
is injective and projective as an SF (n, q)-module.
    Therefore we may assume that F is infinite. The advantage is that F GL(n, F )-
submodules of T r (V ) are the same as SF (n, r)-submodules.
    If q = 1 then C = 0 and Lq (V ) = V : thus the required conclusion follows from
Lemma 2.9. Hence we may assume that q > 1.
    The remaining proof will be done in three steps. Taking careful account of the
hypotheses, we first choose an ordered basis A of L(V ) which contains a basis of
C. This yields a PBW-basis Fq of T q (V ). We then use idempotents from various
descent algebras to modify Fq to another basis Fq∗ of T q (V ). Certain elements of

                                            20
this modified basis will be shown to span a direct summand U of T q (V ) such that
U ∩ Lq (V ) = C and such that U + Lq (V ) is also a direct summand of T q (V ). The
claim about Lq (V )/C then follows easily.
     Let D denote the set of all proper divisors of q. For each d ∈ D we write
d = pj(d) d′ where d′ is not divisible by p. For d ∈ D and i ∈ {0, . . . , m} such that
                                                                                       i ′
d | pi q ′ (equivalently, i ∈ {j(d), . . . , m}), choose a basis B(pi q ′ /d, d) of Lp q /d (Bd ).
     For i ∈ {0, . . . , m − 1} write
                                                [
                                   Api q ′ =              B(pi q ′ /d, d).
                                               d|pi q ′

                                                                                i ′
Thus, by the hypotheses of the proposition, Apiq′ is a basis of Lp q (V ). Similarly,
S                                                                  q
  d∈D B(q/d, d) is a basis of C. We extend this to a basis Aq of L (V ): thus
                                          [
                                   Aq =           B(q/d, d) ∪ A′q ,
                                          d∈D

for some complementary set A′q . For values of r not already dealt with, let Ar be
                                            S
an arbitrary basis of Lr (V ), and write A = r∈N Ar . Thus A is a basis of L(V ).
     For each d ∈ D write
                                                [
                              B(d) =                         B(pi q ′ /d, d).                (4.1)
                                         i∈{j(d),...,m}

Thus
                             [                      [               
                                   B(d) =                      Api q′ r A′q .                (4.2)
                             d∈D                i∈{0,...,m}

     We order A in any way subject to all elements of B(d1 ) being smaller than
all elements of B(d2 ) whenever d1 , d2 ∈ D with d1 < d2 . As in §3, we obtain
a PBW-basis Fq of T q (V ) consisting of all elements of the form a1 a2 · · · al , with
l > 0, a1 , . . . , al ∈ A, a1 4 · · · 4 al and deg a1 · · · al = q. For each λ ∈ Part(q), let
Fλ and Wλ be defined as in §3. Thus we have the PBW-filtration

                 T q (V ) = W(1q ) > · · · > Wλ > Wλ+ > · · · > W(q) > 0,

and the elements of Fλ taken modulo Wλ+ form a basis of Wλ /Wλ+ .
     If we replace each element a1 a2 · · · al of Fλ by any element of Wλ which is
equal to a1 a2 · · · al modulo Wλ+ we get a new set Fλ∗ and if we do this for each λ
                             S
we get a new basis Fq∗ = Fλ∗ of T q (V ).

                                                     21
    For each positive integer r and each λ ∈ Part(r) let cl(λ) denote the p-
equivalence class of λ in Part(r). For each r choose a family of primitive idempo-
tents for the modular descent algebra Dr,F as explained in §3. These are indexed
by the p-equivalence classes in Part(r). For any divisor k of r we write [r, k] for
the partition of r consisting of r/k parts all equal to k, that is,

                                    [r, k] = (k r/k ) = (k, k, . . . , k).

Furthermore, e[r,k] denotes the primitive idempotent of Dr,F indexed by cl([r, k]).
    We now consider cl([q, q ′ ]). This consists of all partitions of q of the form

                   (pm q ′ , . . . , pm q ′ , . . . , piq ′ , . . . , pi q ′ , . . . , q ′ , . . . , q ′ ),

where the number of occurrences of any of the pi q ′ can be 0. In particular,
(q) ∈ cl([q, q ′]). Note that
                                                          [
                                 F(q) = Aq =                    B(q/d, d) ∪ A′q .                                          (4.3)
                                                         d∈D

    Let
                                                       [            
                                       G=                          Fµ r A′q .
                                                  µ∈cl([q,q ′ ])

Thus, by (4.3) and the definition of C,
                                                            M
                               hG ∩ Lq (V )i =                     Lq/d (Bd ) = C,                                         (4.4)
                                                            d∈D


where hG ∩ Lq (V )i denotes the subspace of T (V ) spanned by G ∩ Lq (V ). If f ∈ G
and f = a1 · · · al , as in the definition of Fq , then each factor has degree pi q ′ for
some i ∈ {0, . . . , m} and the factors do not belong to A′q . Thus, by (4.2),
                                                                   [
                                           a1 , . . . , al ∈            B(d).
                                                                 d∈D
                                                                                                       Q
In view of the conditions on the ordering of A we have f =                                                    d∈D   fd where the
elements d of D are taken in increasing order and where, for each d, fd is a product
of elements of B(d) in increasing order.
    Let d ∈ D. By (4.1), each element of B(d) has degree divisible by (q ′ /d′ )d.
Therefore every product of elements of B(d) has degree cd for some non-negative

                                                            22
integer c divisible by q ′ /d′ . For each such c, write G(c, d) for the set of all ele-
ments of T (V ) of the form a1 a2 · · · al with a1 , . . . , al ∈ B(d), a1 4 · · · 4 al and
deg a1 · · · al = cd.
                                              Q
     Let f ∈ G and write f =                      d   fd as above. For each d write deg fd = cd d. Thus
cd is divisible by q ′ /d′ and fd ∈ G(cd , d). Since deg f = q we have
                                                        X
                                                              cd d = q.                                                       (4.5)
                                                          d

     Let S be the set of all families {cd : d ∈ D} of non-negative integers cd
satisfying (4.5) such that cd is divisible by q ′ /d′ for all d. Note that (4.5) gives

                                              cd 6 q/d = pm−j(d) q ′ /d′ .                                                    (4.6)

For each σ ∈ S, where σ = {cd : d ∈ D}, let G(σ) be the subset of T (V ) defined
by
                                                              Y
                                                 G(σ) =              G(cd , d).                                               (4.7)
                                                                d
              S
Thus G =          σ∈S   G(σ).
     We next consider G(cd , d) for fixed d and cd . Since Bd ⊆ T d (V ) we may regard
T (Bd ) as a subalgebra of T (V ), as explained early in §2. Thus T cd (Bd ) ⊆ T cd d (V ).
We shall modify G(cd , d) to get a new set G ∗ (cd , d).
     Consider first the case where cd 6= 0. We form a PBW-basis of T cd (Bd ) as
follows. We start with bases of the Lie powers of Bd using B(pi q ′ /d, d) as the basis
      i ′
of Lp q /d (Bd ) for all i ∈ {j(d), . . . , m}. Hence we get a basis of L(Bd ) containing
B(d) which we order in any way subject to agreement with the order of B(d) that
we already have. The ordered products of degree cd d (as elements of T (V )) give
the required PBW-basis of T cd (Bd ). The PBW-filtration of T cd (Bd ) has factors
indexed by the partitions of cd .
     Consider the p-equivalence class cl([cd , q ′ /d′]). By (4.6), this class consists of
all partitions of cd of the form

     (pm−j(d) q ′ /d′ , . . . , pm−j(d) q ′ /d′ , . . . , pi q ′ /d′ , . . . , pi q ′ /d′ , . . . , q ′ /d′ , . . . , q ′ /d′).

The PBW-basis elements corresponding to these partitions are precisely the ele-
ments of G(cd , d).

                                                                23
    Since Bd is a module for GL(n, F ), the action of Sym(cd ) by place permutations
on T cd (Bd ) commutes with the action of GL(n, F ). Thus e[cd ,q′/d′ ] T cd (Bd ) is a direct
summand of T cd (Bd ) as an F GL(n, F )-module. By hypothesis, Bd is a direct
summand of T d (V ), and so e[cd ,q′ /d′ ] T cd (Bd ) is a direct summand of T cd d (V ).
    For each fd ∈ G(cd , d) define fd∗ = e[cd ,q′/d′ ] fd and write

                             G ∗ (cd , d) = {fd∗ : fd ∈ G(cd , d)}.                               (4.8)

By Proposition 3.5 (applied to the module Bd rather than V ),

                              hG ∗ (cd , d)i = e[cd ,q′ /d′ ] T cd (Bd ).

Thus hG ∗ (cd , d)i is an F GL(n, F )-module which is a direct summand of T cd d (V ).
    If cd = 0 we have G(cd , d) = {1}.                   We define 1∗ = 1.               Thus we take
G ∗ (cd , d) = {1} and hG ∗ (cd , d)i = F.1 = T 0 (V ).
                                                           Q
     For f ∈ G(σ), where σ = {cd : d ∈ D} and f = d fd as above, we define
      Q
f ∗ = d fd∗ . For each d, (3.4) gives that fd∗ is equal to fd modulo terms below fd
in the PBW-filtration of T cd (Bd ). It follows that f ∗ is equal to f modulo terms
below f in the PBW-filtration of T q (V ). Hence f may be replaced by f ∗ in the
basis Fq of T q (V ).
                                                                            S
    This procedure applied to all σ gives f ∗ for all f ∈ G =                   σ   G(σ). For f ∈ Fq rG
we define f ∗ = f , and write Fq∗ = {f ∗ : f ∈ Fq }. Thus Fq∗ is a basis of T q (V ). For
each λ ∈ Part(q) we also write Fλ∗ = {f ∗ : f ∈ Fλ }. Note that if f ∈ F(q) then f
belongs to the bottom term of the PBW-filtration of T q (V ) and so f ∗ = f .
    Recall that G ∗ (cd , d) is given by (4.8). Similarly, write

                                 G ∗ (σ) = {f ∗ : f ∈ G(σ)},

for all σ ∈ S, and
                                                            [
                              G ∗ = {f ∗ : f ∈ G} =              G ∗ (σ).                         (4.9)
                                                             σ

By (4.7), if σ = {cd : d ∈ D}, we have
                                                Y
                                    G ∗ (σ) =         G ∗ (cd , d).
                                                  d

Thus
                                                Y
                                 hG ∗ (σ)i =     hG ∗ (cd , d)i,                                 (4.10)
                                                  d


                                                 24
where the right-hand side denotes the span of the product of the sets hG ∗ (cd , d)i
within T (V ). Since G ∗ (σ) ⊆ Fq∗ , it follows that G ∗ (σ) is a basis of hG ∗ (σ)i. For a
similar reason the spaces hG ∗ (σ)i, σ ∈ S, span their direct sum in T q (V ). Let U
be this direct sum,
                                          M
                                     U=         hG ∗ (σ)i.                            (4.11)
                                          σ∈S
                          ∗            ∗
Thus, by (4.9), U = hG i. Also, since F(q) = F(q) ,

                Lq (V ) = h(G ∩ Lq (V )) ∪ A′q i = h(G ∗ ∩ Lq (V )) ∪ A′q i.

Hence U + Lq (V ) = hG ∗ ∪ A′q i and U ∩ Lq (V ) = hG ∩ Lq (V )i. Thus, by (4.4),

                                     U ∩ Lq (V ) = C.                                 (4.12)

    Since each hG ∗ (cd , d)i is an F GL(n, F )-submodule of T (V ), so is hG ∗ (σ)i, by
(4.10). Indeed, since hG ∗ (cd , d)i is a direct summand of T cd d (V ) for all d, it follows
that hG ∗ (σ)i is a direct summand of T q (V ). Thus, by Lemma 2.9, each hG ∗ (σ)i is
injective as an SF (n, q)-module. Thus, by (4.11), U is injective.
    Let φ : T q (V ) → e[q,q′] T q (V ) be the mapping given by φ(w) = e[q,q′ ] w for all
w ∈ T q (V ). Thus (see §3) φ is a homomorphism of F GL(n, F )-modules; hence a
homomorphism of SF (n, q)-modules. As shown above, U + Lq (V ) is the subspace
of T q (V ) spanned by G ∗ ∪ A′q . However,
                                                    [
                                 G ∗ ∪ A′q =                    Fµ∗ .
                                               µ∈cl([q,q ′ ])

Hence, by Proposition 3.5, the restriction of φ is a vector space isomorphism from
U + Lq (V ) to e[q,q′ ] T q (V ). Thus it is an SF (n, q)-module isomorphism. Therefore,
by Lemma 2.9, U +Lq (V ) is injective and projective. (Hence it is a direct summand
of T q (V ).) However, by (4.12),

                              Lq (V )/C ∼
                                        = (U + Lq (V ))/U.

Since U is injective, it follows that Lq (V )/C is injective and projective. This
completes the proof of Proposition 4.1.                                                   

    We can now state our key result. We refer to §2 for the notation V (n) and
definitions concerning uniform families of modules.

                                               25
    Theorem 4.2. Let F be a field and k a positive integer not divisible by the
characteristic of F . For each positive integer s there exists a uniform family
   (n)                                                                         (n)
{Bsk : n ∈ N} of modules of degree sk such that, for all n, Bsk is a submodule of
Lsk (V (n) ) and a direct summand of T sk (V (n) ) and

    Before proving Theorem 4.2 we show that it implies our main results for an
arbitrary group G.

    Theorem 4.3. Let F be a field and k a positive integer not divisible by the
characteristic of F . Let G be a group and V a finite-dimensional F G-module.
For each positive integer s there is a submodule Bsk of Lsk (V ) such that Bsk is a
direct summand of T sk (V ) and
                                                M
                                   Lsk (V ) =         Ls/c (Bck ).
                                                c|s



    Proof. Let n = dim V . By choice of a basis of V , the representation of G on V
gives a homomorphism θ : G → GL(n, F ). We can regard V as the natural module
                                                                       (n)             (n)
for GL(n, F ). For each positive integer s define Bsk = Bsk where Bsk is as given
by Theorem 4.2. The action of G on T (V ) is the composite of θ and the action of
GL(n, F ) on T (V ). Hence, for each s, Bsk is an F G-submodule of Lsk (V ) and a
                                 L              L
direct summand of T sk (V ), and s Lsk (V ) = s L(Bsk ). By comparing terms of
                               L
degree sk we obtain Lsk (V ) = c|s Ls/c (Bck ).                                

    Theorem 4.4 (Decomposition Theorem). Let F be a field of prime
characteristic p. Let G be a group and V a finite-dimensional F G-module. For
each positive integer r there is a submodule Br of Lr (V ) such that Br is a direct
summand of T r (V ) and, for k not divisible by p and m > 0,

                     mk           m              m−1
                Lp        (V ) = Lp (Bk ) ⊕ Lp         (Bpk ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ L1 (Bpm k ).




                                                26
    Proof. For each positive integer k not divisible by p, take Bk , Bpk , Bp2 k , . . .
as given by Theorem 4.3. The result follows.                                              

    Proof of Theorem 4.2. We shall consider various families {U (n) : n ∈ N} where,
for each n, U (n) is a subspace of T (V (n) ). When n is regarded as fixed but arbitrary
we generally simplify the notation by writing U instead of U (n) . In particular, we
often write V for V (n) .
    Let Q = Q(n) = Lk (V ) ⊕ L2k (V ) ⊕ L3k (V ) ⊕ · · · . Clearly Q is a subalgebra of
             L
L(V ) and Q = r>1 Qr where Qr = Q ∩ Lr (V ) for all r. Of course, Qr = 0 unless
r is divisible by k and Qsk = Lsk (V ) for all s. For each r > 1, let Q(r) denote the
subalgebra of Q generated by Q1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Qr . Also, write Q(0) = 0.
                                       (n)
    For each r > 1, let Wr (or Wr ) be any subspace of Qr with the property that
Qr = (Q(r − 1) ∩ Qr ) ⊕ Wr . The choice of these subspaces is arbitrary at present:
later we make a more careful choice. By Lemma 2.1, we have Q = L(W1 ⊕W2 ⊕· · ·).
Clearly Wr = 0 unless r = sk for some s. Hence Q = L(Wk ⊕ W2k ⊕ W3k ⊕ · · ·).
Also, Wk = Lk (V ).
    For each positive integer s we construct a subspace Bsk of Lsk (V ) such that
Q = L(Bk ) ⊕ L(B2k ) ⊕ · · · . For each s, Bsk depends only on Wk , W2k , . . . , Wsk .
    Step 1. Define Bk = Wk and Ck = W2k ⊕ W3k ⊕ · · · . By Lemma 2.2,

                       Q = L(Bk ⊕ Ck ) = L(Bk ) ⊕ L(Ck ≀ Bk ).                    (4.13)

Also, by Corollary 2.3, Ck ≀ Bk is the direct sum of the subspaces in E1 , where

                       E1 = {[Wik , Bk , . . . , Bk ] : i > 1, r > 0}.
                                    | {z }
                                             r


    Step 2. Let B2k be the sum of all elements of E1 of degree 2k (so that, in fact,
B2k = W2k ) and let C2k be the sum of all elements of E1 of degree greater than 2k.
By Lemma 2.2,
                            L(Ck ≀ Bk ) = L(B2k ) ⊕ L(C2k ≀ B2k ).

Also, by Corollary 2.3, C2k ≀ B2k is the direct sum of the subspaces in E2 , where

               E2 = {[E, B2k , . . . , B2k ] : E ∈ E1 , deg E > 2k, r > 0}.
                         |      {z       }
                                   r


                                                 27
    We continue in this way. In Step s (where s > 1) we define Bsk to be the sum
of all elements of Es−1 of degree sk and Csk to be the sum of all elements of Es−1
of degree greater than sk. By Lemma 2.2 and Corollary 2.3,

                    L(C(s−1)k ≀ B(s−1)k ) = L(Bsk ) ⊕ L(Csk ≀ Bsk )                                   (4.14)

and Csk ≀ Bsk is the direct sum of the subspaces in Es , where

              Es = {[E, Bsk , . . . , Bsk ] : E ∈ Es−1 , deg E > sk, r > 0}.
                        |      {z       }
                                 r

In particular, every subspace in Es has the form

                                     [Wik , Bs(1)k , . . . , Bs(r)k ]

where i > 1, r > 0 and 1 6 s(1) 6 · · · 6 s(r) 6 s.
    By (4.13), (4.14) and considerations of degree, we obtain

                          Q = L(Bk ) ⊕ L(B2k ) ⊕ L(B3k ) ⊕ · · · .                                    (4.15)

    This will give the statement of the theorem if we can show that the families
  (n)                                                                           (n)
{Wsk }   may be chosen so that the resulting families {Bsk } are uniform families
                    (n)
of modules with Bsk a direct summand of T sk (V (n) ) for all n and s.
    Comparing terms of degree sk in (4.15) we have, for all s > 1,
                                                        M
                             Lsk (V ) = Qsk =                   Ls/c (Bck ).                          (4.16)
                                                          c|s

                                       (n)
    As at the end of §2, let Tr              (or Tr when n is understood) denote the class
of all finite-dimensional SF (n, r)-modules that are direct sums of modules each of
which is isomorphic to a direct summand of T r (V (n) ). By Lemma 2.10 it suffices
                                     (n)                        (sk)     (sk)
to obtain uniform families {Bsk } such that Bsk ∈ Tsk                            for all s.
                                                    (n)                                                   (n)
    We start with arbitrary families {Wsk } and then refine the choice of {Wk },
   (n)                                                                                (n)           (n)
{W2k }, . . . , successively, so that the resulting families {Wsk } and {Bsk } are
                                                     (n)        (n)     (n)
uniform families of modules satisfying Wsk , Bsk ∈ Tsk for all n and s.
    There is no choice possible for Wk : we have Wk = Lk (V ). Step 1 of the
                                                                                              (n)         (n)
construction described above gives Bk = Wk . Thus the families {Wk } and {Bk }
are uniform families of modules of degree k. By a well-known result (see, for

                                                   28
example, [13, §3.1]), Lk (V ) is a direct summand of T k (V ), because k is not divisible
by the characteristic of F . Thus Wk ∈ Tk and Bk ∈ Tk .
                                                                                                (n)
     Suppose that s > 2 and that we have chosen the families {Wik } for all i < s
                 (n)                 (n)
so that {Wik } and {Bik } are uniform families of modules belonging to Tik . We
now consider Step s.
     By definition, Bsk is the sum of all elements of Es−1 of degree sk. One such term
is Wsk . The other terms have the form [Wik , Bs(1)k , . . . , Bs(r)k ] with r > 0. Let Usk
denote the sum of these latter terms. Thus Bsk = Usk ⊕ Wsk . Consider a summand
[Wik , Bs(1)k , . . . , Bs(r)k ] of Usk . Since r > 0, we have i < s and s(1), . . . , s(r) < s.
                (n)        (n)                     (n)
Hence {Wik }, {Bs(1)k }, . . . , {Bs(r)k } are uniform families of modules belonging to
Tik , Ts(1)k , . . . , Ts(r)k , respectively.
     Repeated use of Corollary 2.3 gives a vector space isomorphism

                       [Wik , Bs(1)k , . . . , Bs(r)k ] ∼
                                                        = Wik ⊗ Bs(1)k ⊗ · · · ⊗ Bs(r)k .

It is easy to check, by Lemma 2.4, that these spaces are SF (n, sk)-modules and the
isomorphism is a module isomorphism. It follows that [Wik , Bs(1)k , . . . , Bs(r)k ] ∈ Tsk .
                                                            (n)       (n)         (n)
Also, by Lemma 2.7, the family {[Wik , Bs(1)k , . . . , Bs(r)k ]} is uniform. It follows
          (n)
that {Usk } is a uniform family of modules belonging to Tsk .
     By (4.16),
                                                          M
                           Lsk (V ) = Qsk =                         Ls/c (Bck ) ⊕ Usk ⊕ Wsk .         (4.17)
                                                         c|s, c<s

Note that
                                  M
                                            Ls/c (Bck ) ⊕ Usk ⊆ Q(sk − 1) ∩ Qsk
                                 c|s, c<s

and, by the defining property of Wsk ,

                                       Qsk = (Q(sk − 1) ∩ Qsk ) ⊕ Wsk .                               (4.18)

Thus, by (4.17),
                                  M
                                            Ls/c (Bck ) ⊕ Usk = Q(sk − 1) ∩ Qsk .                     (4.19)
                              c|s, c<s

     We next prove that the module
                                                            . M
                                                                               (sk)
                                            Lsk (V (sk) )                Ls/c (Bck )                  (4.20)
                                                              c|s, c<s


                                                                29
is injective and projective as an SF (sk, sk)-module. This is clear if F has charac-
teristic 0 because in that case SF (sk, sk) is semisimple, by [16, (2.6e)]. Thus we
may suppose that F has prime characteristic p. By hypothesis, p ∤ k. For each
                                                           (sk)
positive integer r not divisible by k, define Br                    = 0. In Proposition 4.1, take
                                               (sk)
n = q = sk, V = V (sk) and Bd = Bd                    for every proper divisor d of q. The hy-
potheses of Proposition 4.1 follow from (4.16). Thus the module (4.20) is injective
and projective, as required.
    By (4.17), this module has a submodule
                   M                      . M
                          s/c  (sk)   (sk)             (sk)
                        L (Bck ) ⊕ Usk          Ls/c (Bck )
                        c|s, c<s                            c|s, c<s

                 (sk)                            (sk)
isomorphic to Usk . By Lemma 2.9, Usk is injective. It follows that
                                  . M                     
                                              (sk)    (sk)
                    Lsk (V (sk) )      Ls/c (Bck ) ⊕ Usk
                                         c|s, c<s

                                                             (sk)       (sk)
is injective and projective. Hence there exists Zsk ∈ Tsk such that
                                   M         (sk)    (sk)  (sk)
                   Lsk (V (sk) ) =    Ls/c (Bck ) ⊕ Usk ⊕ Zsk .
                                    c|s, c<s

                    (sk)                                                (n)
By Lemma 2.5, Zsk            extends to a uniform family {Zsk } of modules of degree
                                   (n)          (n)
sk. Also, by Lemma 2.10, Zsk ∈ Tsk                    for all n. Furthermore, by Lemma 2.7,
        (n)                                                                                  (n)
{Ls/c (Bck )} is uniform, for all proper divisors c of s, and we have seen that {Usk }
is uniform. Hence, by Lemma 2.6, we have (for arbitrary n)
                                M
                     Lsk (V ) =    Ls/c (Bck ) ⊕ Usk ⊕ Zsk .
                                     c|s, c<s

Therefore, in view of (4.19),

                         Qsk = Lsk (V ) = (Q(sk − 1) ∩ Qsk ) ⊕ Zsk .

However, (4.18) is the defining property of Wsk . Thus we may replace our arbitrary
                                                                                             (n)
choice of Wsk by taking Wsk = Zsk . Recall that Bsk = Usk ⊕ Wsk . Thus {Wsk }
       (n)
and {Bsk } are uniform families of modules belonging to Tsk .
    This completes the proof of Theorem 4.2.                                                   
