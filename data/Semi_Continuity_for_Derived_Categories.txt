                                                     Abstract. We prove that the number of parameters defining a complex of
                                                     projective modules over an algebra is upper semi-continuous in families of
                                                     algebras. Supposing that every algebra is either derived tame or derived wild,
                                                     we get that a degeneration of a derived wild algebra is also derived wild. The
                                                     proof follows the pattern of the paper [5] and rests upon universal families
                                                     with projective bases. We also explain why the so-called counter-example of
                                                     Brüstle [2] is in fact not a counter-example.



                                                In the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras it is usual to distin-
                                            guish three types of algebras: representation finite, tame and wild (cf. [6, 4]). A
                                            useful tool in establishing representation type is provided by deformation theory.
                                            It is based on upper semi-continuity of parameter number par(n, A(x)) defining an
                                            n-dimensional module over an algebra A(x), when A(x) is an algebraic family of
                                            algebras (see [7, 5]). During last years analogous investigation of derived categories
                                            has been started, especially derived tame and wild algebras have been considered.
                                            In this article we define parameter numbers of complexes and prove that they are
                                            also upper semi-continuous in families of algebras. We follow the technique elab-
                                            orated in [5] and going back to a paper of H. Knörrer [12]. Especially, our proof
                                            depends on the construction of (almost) universal families of complexes with pro-
                                            jective bases. As a corollary, we prove that if an algebra, which is not derived
                                            tame, degenerates to another algebra, the latter is also not derived tame (note that
                                            most people working on the subject believe that ‘not tame’ means ‘wild’ in this
                                            situation too). Recently Th. Brüstle [2] has announced a counter-example to the
                                            last assertion. We explain why it is actually not a counter-example.

                                               Let A be a ring. We denote by Mod-A (mod-A) the category of right A-modules
                                            (respectively, of finitely generated A-modules). We define the category Kn (A) as
                                            follows.
                                                 1. Its objects are finite complexes of projective A-modules
                                                                                 d               dn−1

                                                2. Morphisms in Kn (A) are homomorphisms of complexes modulo quasi-homo-

       are called quasi-homotopic if there are homomorphisms of modules sk : Pk →
         ′                                                                    n
       Pk+1  such that ψk = φk + sk−1 dk + d′k+1 sk for all k < n. We write φ ∼ ψ in
       this case and call s = (sk ) a quasi-homotopy from φ to ψ.
Note that the last homomorphisms φn , ψn do not influence quasi-homotopy at all.
   There is a natural functor In : Kn (A) → Kn+1 (A). Namely, if P• is a complex
from Kn , choose an epimorphism dn+1 : Pn+1 → Pn with Im dn+1 = Ker dn and
define In P• as the complex
                                dn+1         d
                        Pn+1 −−−−→ Pn −−−n−→ . . . −→ Pm .
If φ is a homomorphism P• → P•′ , we can lift it to a homomorphism In φ : In P• →
                                        n
In P•′ in a usual way. Moreover, if φ ∼ ψ and s = (sn ) is a corresponding quasi-
homotopy, one easily sees that d′n (φn − ψn − sn−1 dn ) = 0, hence there is a mapping
             ′
sn : Pn → Pn+1   such that φn − ψn − sn−1 dn = d′n+1 sn , so we get a quasi-homotopy
     n+1
In φ ∼ In ψ. Therefore the functor In is well defined. It gives rise to the direct
limit Kω (A) = limn Kn (A).
                 −→
Proposition 1.1. The category Kω (A) is equivalent to the bounded derived cate-
gory Db (Mod-A). If A is noetherian, the bounded derived category Db (mod-A) is
equivalent to the full subcategory Kfω (A) = limn Kfn (A) of Kω (A), where Kfn (A) is
                                             −→
the full subcategory of Kn (A) consisting of complexes of finitely generated modules.
    (This result traces back to the paper [11].)
Proof. Consider the functor Jn : Kn (A) → Db (Mod-A), which maps a complex P•
to the complex
                                       d           dn−1
                 Ker dn −→ Pn −−−n−→ Pn−1 −−−−→ . . . −→ Pm .
One can check that Jn+1 In ≃ Jn , so we get the limit functor J = limn Jn :
                                                                            −→
Kω (A) → Db (Mod-A). On the other hand, let C• be a complex from Db (Mod-A)
such that Ck = 0 for k ≥ n. Consider its projective resolution P• ; it is exact at all
                      (n)
Pk with k ≥ n. Let P• ∈ Kn (A) be the complex that coincide with P• for k ≤ n.
                 (n)                                (n)      (n+1)
Then C• ≃ Jn P• in Db (Mod-A). Moreover, In P• ≃ P•                , so C• ≃ J P (n)
                        b             ω
and we get a functor D (Mod-A) → K (A) inverse to J .
   The assertion about noetherian case is obvious.                                  
   Note that there are also natural functors En : Kn+1 (A) → Kn (A): we just omit
the term Pn+1 . Hence the inverse limit K∞ (A) = limn Kn (A) is defined and the
                                                    ←−
following result hold.
Proposition 1.2. The category K∞ (A) is equivalent to the right bounded de-
rived category D− (Mod-A). If A is noetherian, the right bounded derived category
D− (mod-A) is equivalent to the full subcategory Kf∞ (A) = limn Kfn (A) of K∞ (A).
                                                            ←−
   The proof is quite analogous to that of Proposition 1.1 and we omit it.
   Suppose now that the ring A is semiperfect [1]; set R = rad A. Then any
right bounded complex of finitely generated projective A-modules is homotopic to
a minimal complex P• , i.e. such that Im dn ⊆ Pn−1 R for all n. Thus, considering
Kfn (A), we may confine ourselves to minimal complexes, and we shall always do so.
Note that two minimal complexes are homotopic if and only if they are isomorphic.
We call a minimal complex (1.1) reduced if Ker dn ⊆ Pn . Any complex from Kfn (A)

is isomorphic (as complex) to a direct sum of a reduced one and a complex having all
zero components except maybe the nth. The latter is a zero object of K n (A), so any
complex is isomorphic in Kfn (A) to a reduced one. Moreover, if a homomorphism
φ : P• → P•′ of reduced complexes from Kfn (A) is quasi-homotopic to 0, Im φk ⊆
Pk′ R for all k including k = n. Therefore if two reduced complexes are isomorphic
in Kfn (A), they are isomorphic as complexes.
    We denote by C n (A) the category of minimal complexes P• with Pk = 0 for k > n
and by C0n (A) its full subcategory of reduced complexes. Then the natural functor
C n (A) → Kfn (A) induces a representation equivalence of C0n (A) onto Kfn (A). Here
we call a functor F : A → B a representation equivalence, if
     • F is dense, i.e. every object from B is isomorphic to F A for some object
       A ∈ A;
     • F is full, i.e. all induced mappings A(A, A′ ) → B(F A, F A′ ) are surjective;
     • F is conservative, i.e. F φ is an isomorphism if and only if φ is an isomor-
       phism.
An evident consequence of these conditions is
     • F A is indecomposable if and only if A is indecomposable.
    Let A1 , A2 , . . . , At be all pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable projective
A-modules (all of them are direct summands of A). If P is a finitely gener-
                                                                 Lt
ated projective A-module, it uniquely decomposes as                 i=1 pi Ai . We denote by
r(P ) the vector (p1 , p2 , . . . , pt ) and call it the rank of P . For any complex (1.1)
from C n (A) we denote by r• (P• ) and call the vector rank of P• the sequence
(r(Pn ), r(Pn−1 ), . . . , r(Pm )). As we have already remarked, every complex from
                                      Lt
C n (A) decomposes as P• ⊕ ( i=1 ai Ai [n]), where P• is a reduced complex and
A[n] denotes, as usually, the complex with a unique non-zero component, namely
the nth one, equal A. Thus, from the viewpoint of classification problem, there is
no essential difference between C n (A) and Kfn (A).
                                                               Lt
    Given a vector r = (p1 , p2 , . . . , pt ), we denote rA = i=1 pi Ai and set A(r, r′ ) =
HomA (rA, r′ A), R(r, r′ ) = HomA (rA, r′ AR). For any sequence (rn , rn−1 , . . . , rm )
we consider the set C n (r) of minimal complexes

                               d               dn−1
(1.2)                 rn A −−−n−→ rn−1 A −−−−→ . . . −→ rm A,

or, the same, of sequences (dn , dn−1 , . . . , dm+1 ) with dk ∈ R(rk , rk−1 ) such that
dk dk+1 = 0 for all m < k < n. Two sequences (dk ) and (d′k ) define isomorphic
complexes if and only if there are invertible mappings αk ∈ A(rk , rk ) (m ≤ k ≤ n)
such that αk−1 dk = d′k αk for all m < k ≤ n. Especially two sequences (dn )
and (λn dn ), where λn are invertible elements from the centre of A, always define
isomorphic complexes.
   If A is a finite dimensional algebra over a field k, it allows us to consider com-
plexes from C n (A) of a fixed vector rank r• as (k-valued)      points of an algebraic
variety C(r• ), which is a subvariety of H(r• ) = nk=m+1 R(rk , rk+1 ). Moreover,
                                                       Q
homothetic sequences (dn ) and (λdn ) define isomorphic complexes, so considering
the classification problem we may replace the vector space H(r• ) by the projective
space P(r• ) = P(H(r• )) and C(r• ) by its image D(r• ) in P(r• ), which is a projective
variety.

                              2. Families of complexes
    From now on let A be a finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed
field k and I ⊆ R be an ideal. We define an I-family of A-complexes over an
algebraic variety X as a complex of flat coherent sheafs of AX -modules
                                  d              dn−1
(2.1)              P• : Pn −−−n−→ Pn−1 −−−−→ . . . −→ Pm ,
where AX = OX ⊗ A, such that Im dk ⊆ Pk−1 I for all m < k ≤ n. If I = R, we
also call such a complex a family of minimal A-complexes. Given a family P• and
a point x ∈ X, we get a complex P• (x) from C n (A). Since Pn are locally free over
OX , the ranks r(Pk (x)) are locally constant. We usually suppose X connected;
then these ranks are constant, so we can define r(Pk ) and r• (P• ). Consider the set
                      I = { (x, y) ∈ X × X | P• (x) ≃ P• (y) } .
It is a constructible subset of X × X and for each x ∈ X the set
                  I(x) = π1−1 (x) ∩ I ≃ { y ∈ X | P• (y) ≃ P• (x) }
is closed in I, hence also constructible. One can easily derive from the stan-
dard results on dimensions of fibres [10, Exercise II.3.22] that the set Xi (P• ) =
{ x ∈ X | dim I(x) ≤ i } is constructible too. (It is also a consequence of Proposi-
tions 2.1 and 2.3 below.) We define the number of parameters in the family P•
as
                         par(P• ) = max { dim Xi (P• ) − i } ,
                                          i
the number of parameters in I-families of vector rank r• as
                   par(r• , A, I) = max { par(P• ) | r• (P• ) = r• } ,
and the number of parameters in families of minimal complexes of vector rank r as
                              par(r• , A) = par(r• , A, R).
It is a formal version of the intuitive impression about the number of parameters
necessary to define an individual complex inside the family. Of course, we are
mainly interested in the “absolute” value par(r, A), but further on we need also
its “relative” version. Obviously par(r• , A, J) ≤ par(r• , A, I) if I ⊇ J, especially
always par(r• , A, I) ≤ par(r• , A).
   A family of complexes (2.1) is called non-degenerate if for every point x ∈ X at
least one of the homomorphisms dk (x) is non-zero. Obviously, there is an open set
U ⊆ X such that the restriction of P• onto U is non-degenerate, and considering
classification problems, as well as calculating parameter numbers, it is enough to
deal with non-degenerate families.
   We are able, just as in [5], to construct some “almost universal” non-degenerate
families. It is important that their bases L   are projective varieties. Namely, fix
                                                 n                                ′
a vector rank r• and set H = H(r, I) =           k=m+1 I(rk , rk−1 ), where I(r, r ) =
              ′
HomA (rA, r AI). Consider the projective space P = P(r• , I) = P(H) and its closed
subset D = D(r• , I) ⊆ P consisting of sequences (hk ) such that hk+1 hk = 0 for all
k. Because of the universal property of projective spaces [10, Theorem II.7.1], the
embedding D(r• ) → P(r• ) gives rise to a non-degenerate I-family V• = V• (r• , I)
                                      d            dn−1
                 V• (r• ) :   Vn −−−n−→ Vn−1 −−−−→ . . . −→ Vm ,
where Vk = OD (n − k) ⊗ rk A for all m ≤ k ≤ n. We call V• (r• , I) the canonical
I-family of A-complexes over D(r• , I). Moreover, morphisms φ : X → D(r• , I)
                       SEMI-CONTINUITY FOR DERIVED CATEGORIES                                      5


correspond to non-degenerate families of shape (2.1) with Pk = L⊗(n−k) ⊗ rk A for
some invertible sheaf L over X. Namely, such a family can be obtained as φ∗ V• for
a uniquely defined morphism φ.
Proposition 2.1. For every non-degenerate family of I-complexes P• of vector   S
rank r• over an algebraic variety X there is a finite covering open X = j Uj
such that the restriction of P• onto each Uj is isomorphic to φ∗j V(r• , I) for some
morphism φj : Uj → D(r• , I).
Proof. For each x ∈ X there is an open neighbourhood U ∋ x such that all restric-
tions Pk |U are isomorphic to OU ⊗ rk A, so the restriction P• |U is obtained from a
morphism U → D(r• , I). Evidently it implies the assertion.                       
  Note that morphisms φj are not canonical, so we cannot glue them into a global
morphism X → D(r• , I).
Corollary 2.2. par(r• , A, I) = par(V• (r• , I)).
   The main advantage of the families V• (r• , I) is the following.
Proposition 2.3. All sets
  Di (r• , I) = { x ∈ D(r• , I) | dim { y ∈ D(r• , I) | V• (r• , I)(y) ≃ V• (r• , I)(x) } ≤ i }
are closed in D(r• , I).
                                              Qn
Proof. Consider the group G = G(r• ) = k=m AutA (rk A). It acts on H(r• , I):
(gk )(hk ) = (gk−1 hk gk−1 ), hence also on P(r• , I) and on D(r• , I). Moreover, com-
plexes V(r• , I)(x) and V(r• , I)(y) are isomorphic if and only if the points x and y are
in the same orbit of the group G. Hence Di (r• , I) = { x ∈ D(r• , I) | dim Gx ≤ i },
and it is well known that this set is closed.                                          
   In the next section we shall mainly consider complexes and families of free mod-
ules, so we introduce corresponding notations. Let a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , at ) = r(A).
For any sequence of integers b = (bn , bn−1 , . . . , bm ) we set ba = (bn a, . . . , bm a),
D(b, A, I) = D(ba, I) and par(b, A, I) = par(ba, A, I), in particular par(b, A) =
par(ba, A, R). For any r = (r1 , r2 , . . . , rt ) we denote by ]r/a[ the smallest integer b
such that bai ≥ ri for all i. If r• = (rn , . . . , rm ), we set ]r• /a[= (]rn /a[, . . . , ]rm /a[).
Just analogous the values [r/a] and [r• /a] are defined. If b =]r• /a[ and b′ = [r• /a],
then evidently
                      par(b′ a, A, I) ≤ par(r• , A, I) ≤ par(ba, A, I).
Therefore, when we are interested in the asymptotic of the function par(r• , a) for
big ranks, we may only consider complexes of free A-modules.

                                 3. Families of algebras
   A family of algebras over an algebraic variety X is a sheaf A of OX -algebras,
which is coherent and flat (thus locally free) as a sheaf of OX -modules. For such
a family and every sequence b = (bn , bn−1 , . . . , bm ) one can define the function
par(b, A, x) = par(b, A(x)). Our main result is the upper semi-continuity of these
functions.
Theorem 3.1. Let A be a family of algebras based on a variety X. The set Xj =
{ x ∈ X | par(b, A, x) ≥ j } is closed for every b and every integer j.

Proof. We may assume that X is irreducible. Let K be the field of rational functions
on X. We consider it as a constant sheaf on X. Set R = rad(A ⊗OX K) and
R = R ∩ A. It is a sheaf of nilpotent ideals. Moreover, if ξ is the generic point
of X, the factor algebra A(ξ)/R(ξ) is semisimple. Hence there is an open set
U ⊆ X such that A(x)/R(x) is semisimple, thus R(x) = rad A(x) for every x ∈ U .
Therefore par(b, A, x) = par(b, A(x), R(x)) for x ∈ U , so Xj = Xj (R) ∪ Xj′ , where
                    Xj (R) = { x ∈ X | par(b, A(x), R(x)) ≥ j }
        ′
and X = X \ U is a closed subset in X. Using noetherian induction, we may
suppose that Xj′ is closed, so we only have to prove that Xj (R) is closed too.
   Consider the locally free sheaf H = nk=m+1 Hom(bk A, bk−1 R) and the projec-
                                        L
tive space bundle P(H) [10, Section II.7]. Every point h ∈ P(H) defines a set of
homomorphisms hk : bk A(x) → bk−1 R(x) (up to a homothety), where x is the
image of h in X, and the points h such that hk hk+1 = 0 form a closed subset
D ⊆ P(H). We denote by π the restriction onto D of the projection P(H) → X; it
is a projective, hence closed mapping. Moreover, for every point x ∈ X the fibre
π −1 (x) is Q
            isomorphic to D(b, A(x), R(x)). Consider also the group variety G over
              n
X: G = k=m GLbk (A). There is a natural action of G on D over X, and the
sets Di = { z ∈ D | dim Gz ≤ i} are closed in D. Therefore 	the sets Zi = π(D
                                                                             Si ) are
closed in X, as well as Zij = x ∈ Zi | dim π −1 (x) ≥ i + j . But Xj (R) = i Zij ,
thus it is also a closed set.                                                      

                     4. Derived tame and wild algebras
   To define derived tame and wild algebras we need consider families of complexes
based on non-commutative algebras. As before, we assume that the field k is
algebraically closed, though the definitions do not use this restriction.
Definition 4.1. Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over the field k with radical
R and B be any k-algebra.
   1. A family of minimal A-complexes based on B is defined as a complex
                                 d             dn−1
(4.1)              P• :    Pn −−−n−→ Pn−1 −−−−→ . . . −→ Pm ,
       of finitely generated projective B◦ ⊗ A-modules such that Im dk ⊆ Pk−1 R
       for all k.
    2. For a family (4.1) and a finite dimensional (over k) left B-module L we
       denote by P• (L) the complex
                          1⊗d                1⊗dn−1
             L ⊗B Pn −−−−n→ L ⊗B Pn−1 −−−−−→ . . . −→ L ⊗B Pm .
    3. We call a family (4.1) strict if
        (a) P• (L) ≃ P• (L′ ) if and only if L ≃ L′ ;
        (b) P(L) is indecomposable if and only if L is indecomposable.
    4. We call A derived wild if for every finitely generated k-algebra B there is a
       strict family of minimal A-complexes based on B.
    5. We call A derived tame if there is a set M of families of minimal A-complexes
       with the following properties:
        (a) Every P• ∈ M is based on a rational algebra B, which means that
             B ≃ k[x, f (x)−1 ] for a non-zero polynomial f (x). We define r• (P• ) as
             r• (P• (L)) for some (hence any) one-dimensional B-module L.
                     SEMI-CONTINUITY FOR DERIVED CATEGORIES                                  7


       (b) The set
                           M(r• ) = { P• ∈ M | r• (P• ) = r• }

            is finite for each r• .
        (c) For every r• all indecomposable minimal A-complexes of vector rank
            r• , except maybe finitely many isomorphism classes of such complexes,
            are isomorphic to P• (L) for some P• ∈ M and some B-module L.

Remark. These definitions do not coincide but are easily seen to be equivalent
to other used definitions of derived tame and wild algebras, for instance those of
[8, 2, 9]. As usually, to show that A is derived wild it suffices to construct a strict
family over one of specimen algebras such as free algebra khx, yi, or polynomial
algebra k[x, y], or power series algebra k[[x, y]].

   The following proposition follows from elementary geometrical consideration like
in [3].

Proposition 4.2.        1. If A is derived tame, then P   par(b, A) ≤ |b| dim A for each
                                                            n
       sequence b = (bn , bn−1 , . . . , bm ), where |b| = k=m bk .
    2. If A is derived wild, then there is a sequence b such that par(cb, A) ≥ c2
       for every integer c.
   In particular, no algebra can simultaneously be both derived tame and derived
wild.

  In what follows we use the following supposition, which is believed by most
experts.

Supposition 4.3. Every finite dimensional algebra is either derived tame or de-
rived wild.1

Corollary 4.4. Let A be a family of algebras based on a algebraic variety X. Then
W = { x ∈ X | A(x) is derived wild } is a union of a countable sequence of closed
subsets.
                   S
Proof. Indeed W = c,b Wc,b , where Wc,b = { x ∈ X | par(cb, A(x)) > c|b| rk A) }.
By Theorem 3.1 all these subsets are closed in X.                               

Conjecture 4.5. In the situation of Corollary 4.4, the set W is always closed in
X, or, the same, the set { x ∈ X | A(x) is tame } is open.

Corollary 4.6. Suppose that an algebra A, which is derived wild, degenerates to
another algebra A, i.e. there is a family of algebras A based on a variety X such
that A(x) ≃ A for all x from a dense open subset UX and there is a point y ∈ X
such that A(y) ≃ A. Then A is also derived wild.

Remark 4.7. Recently Th. Brüstle has announced a counter-example to the semi-
continuity for derived categories (cf. [2, Section 8.1]). Namely, he claims that the

As a matter of fact, it is not an example, since dim A = 15, while dim A = 16, so
the latter cannot be a degeneration of the former.
