                                                                                 Abstract
                                                      Let Hk (W, q) be the Iwahori–Hecke algebra associated with a finite
                                                   Weyl group W , where k is a field and 0 6= q ∈ k. Assume that the
                                                   characteristic of k is not “bad” for W and let e be the smallest i > 2
                                                   such that 1+q+q 2 +· · ·+q i−1 = 0. We show that the number of simple
                                                   Hk (H, q)-modules is “generic”, i.e., it only depends on e. The proof
                                                   uses some computations in the CHEVIE package of GAP and known
                                                   results due to Dipper–James, Ariki–Mathas, Rouquier and the author.


                                             1    Introduction
                                             Let Γ be one of the graphs in Table 1. Let S be the set of nodes of Γ.
                                             For s, t ∈ S, s 6= t, we define an integer m(s, t) as follows. If s, t are not
                                             joined in the graph, then m(s, t) = 2; if s, t are joined by an unlabelled
                                             edge, then m(s, t) = 3. Finally, if s, t are joined by an edge with label m,
                                             we set m(s, t) = m. We then define a group W = W (Γ) by the following
                                             presentation:

                                                 W = hs ∈ S | s2 = 1 for s ∈ S and (st)m(s,t) = 1 for s, t ∈ S, s 6= ti.

                                             It is known that the groups defined in this way are all finite and that they
                                             are precisely the Weyl groups arising in the theory of complex simple Lie
                                             algebras or linear algebraic groups; see [2]. For example, if Γ is the graph An ,
                                             then W is isomorphic to the symmetric group Sn+1 , where the generator si ∈
                                             S attached to the node labelled by i corresponds to the basic transposition
                                             (i, i + 1) for 1 6 i 6 n.

   Now let k be any field and q ∈ k be any non-zero element which has a
square root in k. Then we define an associative k-algebra H = Hk (W, q)
(with identity 1H ) by a presentation with

   generators: Tw , w ∈ W,
   relations:  Ts2 = q 1H + (q − 1)Ts for all s ∈ S,
               Tw Tw′ = Tww′ for w, w′ ∈ W with l(ww′ ) = l(w) + l(w′ ).

Here, the length function l : W → N0 is defined as follows. Any element
w ∈ W can be written in the form w = s1 · · · sm with s1 , . . . , sm ∈ S; if m is
as small as possible, we set l(w) := m. It is known that {Tw | w ∈ W } is in
fact a k-basis of H and that we have the following multiplication rules. Let
s ∈ S and w ∈ W . Then we have l(sw) = l(w) ± 1 and
                    
                              Tsw            if l(sw) = l(w) + 1,
            Ts Tw =
                       qTsw + (q − 1)Tw      if l(sw) = l(w) − 1;

see [10, Chapter 4]. These algebras play an important role, for example, in
the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type (see [2] and [4]) or in
the theory of knots and links (see [10, Chapter 4]).
    Now the structure of H is relatively well-understood in the case where
Hk (W, q) is split semisimple. Then Lusztig (see [12] and the references
there) has constructed a canonical isomorphism from H onto the so-called
asymptotic algebra which itself is isomorphic to the group algebra of W
Geck: Number of simple modules                                               3


over k (if the characteristic of k does not divide the order of W ). The case
where Hk (W, q) is not semisimple is much more difficult and far from being
solved. Let Irr(Hk (W, q)) be the set of simple Hk (W, q)-modules modulo
isomorphism. The purpose of this paper is to establish the following result.

Theorem 1.1 Let ℓ > 0 be the characteristic of k. Assume that
              ℓ 6= 2          if W is of type Bn or Dn ;
              ℓ 6= 2, 3       if W is of type G2 , F4 , E6 or E6 ;
              ℓ 6= 2, 3, 5    if W is of type E8 .

Let e be the smallest i > 2 such that 1 + q + q 2 + · · · + q i−1 = 0. (We set
e = ∞ if no such i exists.) Then we have

                      |Irr(Hk (W, q))| = |Irr(HC (W, ζe ))|,

where ζe ∈ C is a primitive eth root of unity. (We set ζ∞ = 1.) In particular,
|Irr(Hk (W, q))| only depends on e, but not on the particular choice of k or q.

   The above result is already known in the following cases.
 An : In this case, |Irr(Hk (W, q))| is the number of e-regular partitions of
      n+1; see Dipper–James [5]. A partition of n+1, written in exponential
      form (1n1 , 2n2 , . . .), is called e-regular if ni < e for all i.
 Bn : In this case, |Irr(Hk (W, q))| is the number of so-called Kleshchev bi-
      partitions of n; see Ariki–Mathas [1] for the proof and the precise
      definition.
Dn : In this case, the problem of computing |Irr(Hk (W, q))| can be reduced
     to the analogous problem for type Bn (but one has to consider an
     algebra of type Bn with unequal parameters); see Geck [8].
For the exceptional types G2 , F4 and E6 , the numbers |Irr(Hk (W, q))| are
explicitly known by work of Geck and Lux without any restriction on the
characteristic, but assuming that ℓ = 0 or that q lies in the prime field of k;
see [4, §3.4] and the references there.
    Consequently, we will only have to prove Theorem 1.1 for the exceptional
types G2 , F4 , E6 , E7 and E8 . In Section 2, we present a result (originally
due to Geck–Rouquier [11]), which reduces that proof to the verification
of a finite number of cases. These finitely many cases will be settled by
some explicit computations in Section 3, using the CHEVIE package [9] of
the computer algebra system GAP [13]. The numbers |Irr(HC (W, ζe ))| (for
W of exceptional type) are printed in the table in [10, 11.5.13].

Remark 1.2 The conditions on ℓ in Theorem 1.1 mean that ℓ is a “bad
prime” for W in the sense of [2, p. 28]. Simple examples show that, in
general, we will have |Irr(Hk (W, q))| < |Irr(HC (W, ζe ))| if the characteristic
of k is bad for W ; see, for example, type G2 in [4, Ex. 3.11] and the remarks
at the end of this paper.


2    The generic algebra and its specializations
We keep the setting and the notation of Section 1. In order to get hold of
Irr(Hk (W, q)), we will work with the generic Iwahori–Hecke algebra associ-
ated with W and use specialization arguments. For this purpose, we have
to introduce some notation. We use [10] as a standard reference for general
facts about finite Weyl groups and Iwahori–Hecke algebras.
    Let A = Z[v, v −1 ] be the ring of Laurent polynomials in an indeter-
minate v; let u = v 2 . Then we define the generic Iwahori–Hecke algebra
H = HA (W, u) in a similar way as Hk (W, q) was defined in Section 1. Al-
though now we are not working over a field, it is still true that H is free
as an A-module, with basis {Tw | w ∈ W }; see [10, Chapter 4]. Let K be
the field of fractions of A and HK = K ⊗A H be the K-algebra obtained by
extending scalars from A to K; we have HK = HK (W, u) canonically. It is
known that the algebra HK is split semisimple; see [10, 9.3.5].
    Let τ : H → A be the A-linear map defined by τ (T1 ) = 1 and τ (Tw ) = 0
for 1 6= w ∈ W . Then, by [10, 8.1.1], τ is a symmetrizing trace on H and
H is a symmetric algebra. Let Irr(HK ) be the set of simple HK -modules,
up to isomorphism. Let cV ∈ K be the Schur element corresponding to
V ∈ Irr(HK ); see [10, §7.2]. Since HK is split semisimple, we have cV 6= 0
for all V . Since A is integrally closed in K, we have cV ∈ A; see [10, 7.3.8].
We shall need the following fact, which is a combination of [2, p. 75], [10,
9.3.6] and the remarks in [12, 3.4], [7, 2.4].
                   X
(2.1) Let PW =          ul(w) . Then we have a factorization
                 w∈W

                                |S|
                                Y
                       |S|
               (u − 1) PW     =     (udi − 1),     where di > 1.
                                i=1

The di > 1 are called the degrees of W ; we have |W | = d1 · · · d|S| . Each
Schur element cV lies in Q[u, u−1 ] and divides PW . The denominators in
the coefficients of cV are divisible by bad primes only.

    Now let k be a field and 0 6= q ∈ k be such that q has a square root in k.
Then there is a unique ring homomorphism θ : A → k such that θ(u) = q
(and v is mapped to a chosen square root of q in k). Regarding k as an
A-module via θ, we can extend scalars from A to k and obtain a k-algebra
Hk = k ⊗A H which is canonically isomorphic to Hk (W, q). Thus, it will be
sufficient to work with H and its specializations. We can now settle a large
number of cases occurring in Theorem 1.1.
Lemma 2.2 Assume that the characteristic of k satisfies the conditions in
Theorem 1.1. Then, if q di 6= 1 for all i (where the di are the degrees of
W ), the algebra Hk is split semisimple and we have |Irr(Hk )| = |Irr(HK )| =
|Irr(HC (W, 1))|.
Proof. Using (2.1), the above conditions on k and q imply that θ(cV ) 6=
0 for all V ∈ Irr(HK ). Consequently, by [10, 9.3.9], the algebra Hk is
split semisimple. Then Tits’ Deformation Theorem (see [10, 7.4.6]) applies
and we have |Irr(Hk )| = |Irr(HK )|. Applying the same argument to the
specialization A → C, u 7→ 1, we obtain |Irr(HK )| = |Irr(HC (W, 1))|.
    Thus, from now on, we assume that the conditions in Theorem 1.1 on
the characteristic of k are satisfied and that q is a root of unity. Let k0 ⊆ k
be the field of fractions of the image of θ. Then, by [7, 3.6], the algebra Hk0
is split. So the scalar extension from k0 to k defines a bijection between
Irr(Hk0 ) and Irr(Hk ); see [10, Lemma 7.3.4]. Thus, we may assume without
loss of generality that k = k0 .
    It will be further convenient to take the following point of view. Let p be
the kernel of θ. Then p ⊂ A is a prime ideal and, identifying k with the field
of fractions of A/p, we may regard θ as the natural map A → A/p ⊆ k. Let
e be the smallest i > 2 such that 1 + q + q 2 + · · · + q i−1 = 0 and Φe (u) ∈ Z[u]
be the eth cyclotomic polynomial. Then we have Φe (q) = 0 in k and so
Φe (u) = Φe (v 2 ) ∈ p. Now we have
                    Φe (v 2 ) = Φ2e (v)          if e is even,
                         2
                    Φe (v ) = Φe (v)Φ2e (v)      if e is odd.
Thus, choosing a suitable square root of q in k, we can assume that Φ2e (v) ∈
p. Let q ⊂ A be the prime ideal generated by Φ2e (v); we have 0 6= q ⊆ p ⊂ A
and A/q = Z[ζ2e ], the ring of algebraic integers in the field F = Q[ζ2e ] ⊂ C;
see [3, (4.5)]. Then, as above, we see that HF = HF (W, ζe ) is split and the
scalar extension from F to C defines a bijection Irr(HF ) ↔ Irr(HC (W, q)).
(2.3) Factorization of decomposition maps. In the above set-up, the
natural map A → A/p ⊆ k induces a well-defined decomposition map
Geck: Number of simple modules                                             6


dp : R0 (HK ) → R0 (Hk ) between the Grothendieck groups of HK and Hk ;
see [10, 7.4.3]. Similarly, the map A → A/q ⊆ F induces a decomposition
map de : R0 (HK ) → R0 (HF ). Since A/q is integrally closed in F , we have
the following factorization (see [6, 2.6]):
                                                dp
                          R0 (HK )                     ✲ R0 (Hk )
                                 ◗                       ✑✑
                                                          ✸
                                  d◗
                                   e ◗                  ✑ dep
                                      s
                                      ◗                ✑
                                            R0 (HF )

Here, dep is the decomposition map induced by the natural map A/q → A/p.
Now, since dp and de are surjective by [7, 3.3], we conclude that |Irr(Hk )|
equals the rank of dp and the above factorization implies that

                 |Irr(Hk )| 6 |Irr(HF )| = |Irr(HC (W, ζe ))|.

Note that, if q = p, then Theorem 1.1 is now clear since Hk = HF .
    Thus, we are finally reduced to the situation where q 6= q. In this case,
p is a maximal ideal containing Φ2e (v) and a prime number ℓ > 0. (See the
description of all prime ideals of A in [10, Exercise 7.9], for example.)
    In order to proceed, we shall need some facts about the center of H,
which we denote by Z(H). Let Cl(W ) be the set of conjugacy classes of W .
For each C ∈ Cl(W ), consider the element
                               X
                        zC =       u−l(w) fw,C Tw ∈ H,
                               w∈W

where fw,C (u) ∈ Z[u] are the class polynomials defined in [10, §8.2]. By
[10, 8.2.4] (see also [11]), we have zC ∈ Z(H) and {zC | C ∈ Cl(W )} is an
A-basis of Z(H).

Definition 2.4 (Geck–Rouquier) Consider the natural map A → A/q ⊆
F and the corresponding decomposition map de : R0 (HK ) → R0 (HF ). For
M ∈ Irr(HF ), we define PM : Z(HK ) → K by
                          X          dV,M
          PM (zC ) =                      ωV (zC )     for C ∈ Cl(W ),
                                      cV
                       V ∈Irr(HK )

where dV,M are the decomposition numbers and ωV is the central character
associated with V . By [10, 7.5.3], we have

                   PM (zC ) ∈ Aq          for all C ∈ Cl(W ).

Note that, since q is a principal ideal, the localization Aq ⊂ K is a discrete
valuation ring, with residue field F .
                                 P        −l(w)
    For C ∈ Cl(W ), let z C := w∈W ζe           fw,C (ζe )Tw ∈ HF . Then z C ∈
Z(HF ) and {z C | C ∈ Cl(W )} is an F -basis of Z(HF ); see [10, 8.2.5]. Thus,
we obtain an induced function

               P M : Z(HF ) → F,         P M (z C ) = PM (zC ) mod q.

      In a slightly different form, the following results appeared in [11, 3.3].

Lemma 2.5 Assume that each Schur element cV can be expressed as

(∗)         cV = Φ2e (v)dV fV (v)   where dV > 0 and fV (v) ∈ A \ p.

Then we have PM (zC ) ∈ Ap for all M ∈ Irr(HF ) and C ∈ Cl(W ).

Proof. Let M ∈ Irr(HF ). Consider the ideal I of all g(v) ∈ Q[v, v −1 ] such
that g(v)PM (zC ) ∈ Q[v, v −1 ] for all C ∈ Cl(W ). Since Q[v, v −1 ] is a principal
ideal domain, I is generated by a polynomial g0 (v) ∈ Q[v, v −1 ]. Now, since
PM (zC ) ∈ Aq for all C ∈ Cl(W ), there exists a polynomial h(v) ∈ I which
is not divisible by Φ2e (v). Thus, Φ2e (v) does not divide g0 (v).
    On the other hand, Definition 2.4 shows that the product of all cV lies
in I (note that ωP V (zC ) ∈ A since A is integrally closed in K). So, using (∗)
and setting d := V dV > 0, we find that
                                                   Y
         Φ2e (v)d f (v) ∈ I     where f (v) =              fV (v) ∈ A \ p.
                                               V ∈Irr(HK )


Since Q[v, v −1 ] is a factorial ring, the fact that Φ2e (v) does not divide
g0 (v) implies that g0 (v) divides f (v). Consequently, we have f (v)PM (zC ) ∈
Q[v, v −1 ] for all C ∈ Cl(W ).
    Now (2.4) actually shows that Φ2e (v)d f (v)PM (zC ) ∈ A for all C ∈
Cl(W ). Therefore, since f (v) ∈ A and Φ2e (v) is monic, we conclude that

                     f (v)PM (zC ) ∈ A      for all C ∈ Cl(W ).

Thus, since f (v) ∈ A \ p, we have PM (zC ) ∈ Ap for all C ∈ Cl(W ).

Proposition 2.6 (Geck–Rouquier) In the above set-up, assume that the
condition (∗) in Lemma 2.5 holds. Then we have |Irr(HF )| = |Irr(Hk )|.

Proof. Consider the natural map Ap → k and the corresponding decomposi-
tion map dp : R0 (HK ) → R0 (Hk ). For V ∈ Irr(HK ), let χV : HK → K
be the character afforded by V . Since A is integrally closed in K, we
have χV (Tw ) ∈ A for all w ∈ W . Thus, we obtain an induced function
χ̃V : Hk → k such that χ̃V (Tw ) = χV (Tw ) mod p. By the definition of dp,
the function χ̃V is a k-linear combination of the characters afforded by the
simple Hk -modules. Hence, we certainly have
                      |Irr(Hk )| > dimk hχ̃V | V ∈ Irr(Hk )ik .
On the other hand, consider the decomposition map de induced by Aq → F .
Let B ⊆ Irr(HK ) be such that the matrix of decomposition numbers dV,M ,
where V ∈ B and M ∈ Irr(HF ), is square and invertible over Z. Such a
subset B exists by [7, Theorem 3.3]. We have already seen in (2.3) that
|B| = |Irr(HF )| > |Irr(Hk )|. Hence it is enough to show that
(†)                 {χ̃V | V ∈ B} is linearly independent.
                                                      P
To prove (†), assume that we have a linear relation V ∈B λV χ̃V = 0 with
λV ∈ k.
    Now we consider once more the function PM : Z(HK ) → K introduced
in Definition 2.4. By Lemma P  2.5, we have PM (zC ) ∈ Ap for all C ∈ Cl(W ).
To simplify notation, for h = w∈W aw (v)Tw ∈ H with aw (v) ∈ A, we write
h̃ := w∈W aw (q 1/2 )Tw ∈ Hk , where q 1/2 is the chosen square root of q.
      P
Then, again by [10, 8.2.5], we have z̃C ∈ Z(Hk ) and {z̃C | C ∈ Cl(W )} is a
k-basis of Z(Hk ). Thus, we obtain an induced function
                 P̃M : Z(Hk ) → k,      P̃M (z̃C ) = PM (zC ) mod p.
For each V ∈ Irr(HK ), let χ∗V be the unique element in Z(HK ) such that
ωV (χ∗V ′ ) = cV δV,V ′ for all V ′ ∈P  Irr(HK ). Such an element exists by [10,
7.2.6]; explicitly, we have χ∗V = w∈W u−l(w) χV (Tw )Tw−1 . Since A is inte-
grally closed in K, we have χ∗V ∈ Z(H). Thus, we obtain a corresponding
element χ̃∗V ∈ Z(Hk ). The defining equation in (2.4) now yields that
                     X        dV ′ ,M
   PM (χ∗V ) =                        ωV ′ (χ∗V ) = dV,M for all M ∈ Irr(HF ).
                               cV ′
                V ′ ∈Irr(HK )

Applying this to the above linear relation, we obtain
                                λV d˜V,M , where d˜V,M = dV,M mod p.
         X                    X
    0=       λV P̃M (χ̃∗V ) =
          V ∈B                 V ∈B

But B was chosen such that the matrix (dV,M ) is invertible over Z. Hence
(d˜V,M ) is invertible over k and so λV = 0 for all V ∈ B, proving (†).

3     Proof of Theorem 1.1
By the discussion in Section 2, in order to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1,
it remains to consider the following situation. The field k is the field of
fractions of A/p, where p is a maximal ideal containing a prime number ℓ > 0
which is not bad for W . In particular, k is a finite field of characteristic ℓ.
Furthermore, p contains the cyclotomic polynomial Φ2e (v) ∈ Z[v], where
e > 2 divides some di as in (2.1). The number e is minimal such that
1 + q + q 2 + · · · + q e−1 = 0 in k and there is a square root of q which is also
a root of Φ2e (v) in k. Under these conditions, we must show:

(E)      |Irr(Hk )| = |Irr(HF (W, ζe ))|,      where F = Q[ζ2e ] ⊂ C.

We shall need the following well-known property of cyclotomic polynomials.

Lemma 3.1 Assume that Φd (q) = 0 for some d > 2. If q = 1, then d = ℓn
for some n > 1. If q 6= 1, then e is the order of q in k× and d = eℓn for
some n > 0.

Proof. Let us write d = d′ ℓn where ℓ does not divide d′ . Now Φd (u) certainly
               n
divides Φd′ (uℓ ). Since, furthermore, taking ℓth powers is an automorphism
of k, we conclude that Φd′ (q) = 0. If d′ = 1, this means that q = 1 and
e = ℓ. So the assertion is true in this case. Now assume that q 6= 1. Then e
is minimal such that q e − 1 = 0, i.e., e is the multiplicative order of q. Hence
e divides the order of k× and so is coprime to ℓ. Then Φd′ (q) = 0 implies
   ′
q d = 1 and so e divides d′ . Assume, if possible, that e 6= d′ . Then we can
write            ′
              ud − 1
                      = a(u)Φe (u)Φd′ (u)        where a(u) ∈ Z[u].
               u−1
Differentiating with respect to u and applying the natural map A → A/p ⊆ k
yields that d′ = 0 in k, contradicting the fact that d′ is coprime to ℓ.
    The following result (first established in [11]) provides a general proof
of (E), but under a condition on ℓ which is more restrictive than that in
Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 3.2 (Geck–Rouquier) Assume that ℓ 6= 2 and that eℓ does not
divide any degree di of W . (This condition is satisfied, for example, if ℓ
does not divide |W |.) Then condition (∗) in Lemma 2.5 is satisfied and (E)
holds.
Geck: Number of simple modules                                             10


Proof. By Proposition 2.6, it is enough to verify that condition (∗) in
Lemma 2.5 is satisfied. Using (2.1), we can write cV = Φ2e (v)dV fV (v),
where dV > 0 and fV (v) ∈ Z[v, v −1 ] is a product of an integer divisible
by bad primes only, an integral power of u, Φe (v) (if e is odd) and vari-
ous cyclotomic polynomials Φd (u), where d 6= e and d > 2 divides some
degree di .
    Now consider the natural map θ : A → A/p ⊆ k. Assume, if possible,
that θ(fV (u)) = 0 for some V ∈ Irr(HK ). Since the characteristic of k is
not a bad prime, we must have θ(Φe (v)) = 0 (if e is odd) or θ(Φd (u)) = 0
for some d 6= e where d > 2 divides a degree di . The second possibility
cannot occur by Lemma 3.1 and our assumption. Hence e must be odd and
θ(Φe (v)) = 0. As in the proof of Lemma 3.1, we write (v 2e − 1)/(v − 1) =
b(v)Φe (v)Φ2e (v) with some b(v) ∈ Z[v], differentiate with respect to v and
obtain the conclusion that θ(2e) = 0, i.e., ℓ divides 2e. This contradicts the
fact that ℓ 6= 2 and e is the order of q.
    In Section 1, we have already remarked that Theorem 1.1 is known to
hold for W of type An , Bn and Dn . Thus, it remains to consider the finitely
many exceptional types. For each of these types, we need to know the prime
divisors of |W |, the bad primes and the degrees di . This information is
provided in Table 2. (The information in this table is obtained by inspection
of the tables in [10, Appendix E] and [2, p. 75].)

        Table 2: Bad primes and degrees for the exceptional types.

    Now, given W , e and ℓ, the CHEVIE function in Table 3 computes the
number of simple Hk -modules. This is done by computing the rank of the
character table of HK under the specialization A → A/p ⊆ k. That this
rank indeed equals the cardinality of |Irr(Hk )| follows from [10, 7.5.7 and
8.2.9] and the fact that dp is surjective (see [7, 3.3]). Note also that the
character tables for all HK are explicitly known and available in CHEVIE.
    By Theorem 3.2, we still have to consider all primes ℓ which divide |W |
but are not bad and all e such that e and eℓ divide some degree di . Thus,
Geck: Number of simple modules                                              11


if W is of type G2 or F4 , then all prime divisors of |W | are bad and there
is nothing more to prove. If W is of type E6 , we only have to consider the
prime ℓ = 5. But the only degree divisible by 5 is 5 itself, hence we are
done. If W is of type E7 or E8 , then 2 is the only possible value for e such
that e and eℓ (with ℓ bad) divide some di . Hence it remains to consider the
following cases:
 E7 : e = 2 and ℓ = 5, 7, where we obtain |Irr(Hk )| = 12.
 E8 : e = 2 and ℓ = 7, where we obtain Irr(Hk )| = 23.
These results are in accordance with the corresponding values in character-
istic 0 printed in [10, 11.5.13]. Thus, Theorem 1.1 is proved.

Remark 3.3 Using the above program we find that if e = ℓ is a bad prime,
then |Irr(Hk )| < |Irr(HF )|. So, in general, the assertion in Theorem 1.1 will
not hold if ℓ is a bad prime. (Another example is given in Table 3.)
