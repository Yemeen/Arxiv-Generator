                                                    Abstract. In this note we discuss the closure of an orbital variety as a union of varieties.
                                                    We show that if semisimple Lie algebra g contains factors not of type An then there are
                                                    orbital varieties whose closure contains components which are not Lagrangian. We show
                                                    that the argument does not work if all the factors are of type An and provide the facts
                                                    supporting the conjecture claiming that if all the factors of g are of type An then the
                                                    closure of an orbital variety is a union of orbital varieties.




                                                                                       1. Introduction

                                             1.1. Let G be a connected simply-connected complex algebraic group. Set g = Lie (G).
                                             Consider the co-adjoint action of G on g∗ . Identify g∗ with g through the Killing form. A
                                             G orbit O in g is called nilpotent if it consists of ad-nilpotent elements.
                                               Fix a triangular decomposition g = n− ⊕ h ⊕ n.
                                                Let O be some nilpotent orbit. Consider an intersection O ∩ n. As it was shown by N.
                                             Spaltenstein [7] and R. Steinberg [8], this is an equidimentional variety of the dimension
                                             0.5 dim O. Moreover, it was shown by A. Joseph [2] that this is a Lagrangian subvariety
                                             of O.
                                               An irreducible component of O ∩ n is called an orbital variety associated to O.
                                                According to orbit method philosophy, one would like to attach an irreducible repre-
                                             sentation of the enveloping algebra U(g) to an orbital variety. This should be a simple
                                             highest weight module. The results of A. Joseph and T. A. Springer provide a one to one
                                             correspondence between the set of primitive ideals of U(g) containing the augmentation
                                             ideal of its centre (thus, corresponding to integral weights) and the set of orbital varieties
                                             in g corresponding to Lusztig’s special orbits. Thus, orbital varieties play a key role in
                                             the study of primitive ideals in U(g). The details can be found in [1], [2] and [3].


                                             1.2. The closure of a nilpotent orbit is a union of nilpotent orbits. The combinatorial
                                             description of this union was given by M. Gerstenhaber for g = sln . Further H. Karft and
                                             C. Procesi described this union for other simple Lie algebras.
                                                                                                 1

   Generalizing the results of N. Spaltenstein, D. Mertens [6] showed that O ∩ n = O ∩ n.
Thus, O ∩ n is a union of intersections of n with corresponding orbits defined by the
results of Gerstenhaber and Kraft-Procesi.
   The question is to give a description of an orbital variety closure in the spirit of Ger-
stenhaber theory. This question is much more involved than the question on a nilpotent
orbit closure. It has two components. The first one , a purely geometrical component,
is to describe the type of varieties which constitute the closure of an orbital variety.
This question can be formulated as following. Let V be an orbital variety. Then its G-
saturation OV is a nilpotent orbit, to which V is associated. Let us take some nilpotent
orbit O : O ⊂ OV and consider V ∩ O. As we show in 3.1, this intersection is always not
empty. So, a natural task is to describe the irreducible components of this intersection.
Is this intersection equidimentional? Is this intersection Lagrangian?
   Here we show that if g contains factors not of type An , there exist orbital varieties in
g such that the intersection mentioned above is not Lagrangian.
   We explain why the same argument does not work if all factors are of type An . Moreover,
the study of special cases in [4] and [5] shows that at least for some special types of orbital
varieties in sln (that is An−1 ) the intersection of an orbital variety closure V with any
nilpotent orbit in the closure of OV is Lagrangian. Together with computations in low
rank cases (for n ≤ 6) this supports
Conjecture. In sln the closure of an orbital variety is a union of orbital varieties.

    Note that in any case the straight generalization of Gerstenhaber theory cannot work
for orbital varieties. As it is shown in [4, 4.1], even if V is of the most simple type (that
is, when V is a nilradical) in sln and O ⊂ OV one has that in general V ∩ O =    6 V ∩ O.

1.3. The second component of the description of an orbital variety closure is to give a
combinatorial algorithm describing all the orbital varieties included in the closure of a
given one. This is a very complex combinatorial question. The only general description
of an orbital variety is provided by Steinberg’s construction (cf. 2.1). It is given via
surjection from the Weyl group onto the set of orbital varieties. But even the description
of the fibers of this map is highly non trivial outside of type An . For the type An the
picture is much nicer and simpler. Here the fibers are described by Robinson-Schensted
procedure and the question can be formulated in terms of partial ordering of Young
tableaux. Partial results in this case are provided in [3], [4], [5].

1.4. The body of the paper consists of two sections. In section 2 we give all the essential
background to make this note self-contained. In section 3 we provide the results on the
orbital variety closures.

                                     2. Preliminaries
                                   ORBITAL VARIETIES                                      3




2.1. The definition of an orbital variety does not provide any way to construct it. The
only general construction of an orbital variety belongs to R. Steinberg [8]. We explain it
here in short.
  Let g be any semisimple Lie algebra. Fix its triangular decomposition g = n− ⊕ h ⊕ n.
For any X ∈ n put OX := {gXg −1 : g ∈ G} to be its nilpotent orbit.
  Let B be the Borel subgroup of G with Lie (B) = h ⊕ n and let B act adjointly on n.
   Let R ⊂ h∗ denote the set of non-zero roots, R+ the set of positive roots corresponding
to n in the triangular decomposition of g, and Π ⊂ R+ theL   resulting set of simple roots.
Let Xα denote the root subspace for α ∈ R. One has n =          Xα .
                                                               α∈R+

   Let W be the Weyl group of < n, h > . The action of w ∈ W on root subspace Xα is
defined (in a standard way) by w(Xα ) = Xw(α) . Consider the following subspace of n :
                                           M
                             n ∩w n =                  Xα .
                                       {α∈R+ | w −1 (α)∈R+ }

Consider G(n ∩w n). Since the number of orbits is finite, this is a closure of the unique
orbit which we denote by Ow . By R. Steinberg [8], one has
Theorem. For each w ∈ W there exists an orbital variety V and for each orbital variety
V there exists w ∈ W such that
                                  V = B(n ∩ w n) ∩ Ow .

  In what follows we will denote Vw := V in that case. Obviously, Vw is associated to
Ow .

2.2. For any α ∈ Π let Pα be the standard parabolic subgroup of G such that Lie (P) =
b ⊕ X−α .
    Given I ⊂ Π, let PI denote the unique standard parabolic subgroup of G such that
P−α ⊂ PI iff α ∈ I. Let MI be the unipotent radical of PI and LI a Levi factor. Let
pI , mI , lI denote the corresponding Lie algebras. Set BI := B ∩ LI and nI := n ∩ lI . We
have decompositions B = MI ⋉ BI and n = nI ⊕ mI . They define projections B → BI
and n → nI which we denote by πI .
   Set WI :=< sα : α ∈ I > to be a parabolic subgroup of W. Set DI := {w ∈ W :
w(α) ∈ R+ ∀ α ∈ I}. Set RI+ = R+ ∩ span (I). A well known result provides that each
w ∈ W has a unique expression of the form w = wI dI where dI ∈ DI , wI ∈ WI and
ℓ(w) = ℓ(wI ) + ℓ(dI ). Moreover, for any w ∈ W one has
                                RI+ ∩w R+ = RI+ ∩wI RI+ .
Thus, a decomposition W = WI × DI defines a projection πI : W → WI . For w ∈ W set
wI := πI (w). This element can be regarded as an element of WI and as an element of W.

   Let VwI be the corresponding orbital variety in g and VwI I be the corresponding orbital
variety in lI . As it is shown in [3, 4.1.1] all the projections are in correspondence on orbital
varieties, namely
Theorem. Let g be a reductive Lie algebra. Let I ⊂ Π. For every orbital variety Vw ⊂ g
one has πI (V w ) = VwI I .

2.3. In what follows we need also the notion of τ -invariant. Let w be any element of W.
Set S(w) := R+ ∩w R− = {α ∈ R+ : w −1 (α) ∈ R− }. Set τ (w) = Π ∩ S(w).
  As it can be seen immediately from Steinberg’s construction for orbital variety closures,
one has
Proposition. Let w, y ∈ W. If V w ⊂ V y then τ (w) ⊃ τ (y).

  Note that as a trivial corollary we get that if Vw = Vy then τ (w) = τ (y). In other
words, τ invariant is constant on an orbital variety.


                               3. An orbital variety closure

3.1. We begin with a simple
                                                                   ′
Lemma. Let O, O′ ⊂ g be two nilpotent orbits such that O ( O. Let V be an orbital
variety associated to O. Then V ∩ O′ 6= ∅ and in particular there exist an orbital variety
V ′ associated to O′ such that V ∩ V ′ 6= ∅.

Proof.
Indeed since there exist w ∈ W such that V = B(n ∩w n) and since G/B is projective we
get
                       O′ ⊂ O = G(n ∩w n) = G(B(n ∩w n) = G(V)
which proves the first part.
    Since O′ ∩ V = O′ ∩ n ∩ V we get the existence of V ′ .
                                                                                             


3.2. Our strategy is to show that if in g not all the factors are of type An , there exist
nilpotent orbits O1 , O2 such that O2 ( O1 and there exists Vw associated to O1 such
that for every Vz associated to O2 one has τ (w) 6⊂ τ (z). Then on one hand by lemma 3.1
there exist at least one Vz associated to O2 such that V w ∩ Vz 6= ∅. On the other hand by
proposition 2.3 if τ (z) 6⊃ τ (w) then Vz 6⊂ V w for every Vz associated to O2 . We get that
V w ∩ O2 is a non empty variety of dimension less than 0.5 dim O2 .

3.3. Consider the algebras of type B2 and G2 . They are fully described in [9] and we just
follow these computations.
    B2 : Let s be a reflection corresponding to the long root β and t be the reflection
corresponding to the short root α. Consider Os and Otst . One has Os ) Otst . Moreover,
Otst ∩ n is irreducible so Vtst is the unique orbital variety associated to Otst . Consider Vs .
If its closure is a union of orbital varieties then by lemma 3.1 Vtst must be included in it.
But τ (s) = {β} and τ (tst) = {α} so this inclusion contradicts proposition 2.3.
   In what follows we will need also the following fact about these orbits: there is no
intermediate nilpotent orbit between Os and Otst , that is if O′ is such that Otst ⊂ O′ ⊂ Os
then O′ = Otst or O′ = Os .
   G2 : In that case the picture is very similar to B2 . Let s be a reflection corresponding
to the long root β and t be the reflection corresponding to the short root α. Once more
Os ) Otstst and Otstst ∩n is irreducible so that Vtstst is the unique orbital variety associated
to Otstst . Hence if Vs is a union of orbital varieties then V s ) Vtstst which is again impossible
by proposition 2.3 since τ (s) = {β} and τ (tstst) = {α}.

3.4. For searching the situation in D4 we use the calculations in [7]. Let s3 be the reflec-
tion giving s3 (αi ) = αi + α3 for i = 1, 2, 4 and s1 , s2 , s4 the rest fundamental reflections.
Let us parameterize nilpotent orbits in D4 by the partitions corresponding to their Jor-
dan form. Then there are O1 ↔ (3, 3, 1, 1) and O2 ↔ (3, 2, 2, 1) such that O2 ⊂ O1 .
There are only 2 orbital varieties associated to O2 . The elementary calculations show that
these are Vs1 s2 s4 s3 s1 s2 s4 and Vs3 s1 s2 s4 s3 s1 s2 s4 s3 . Note that τ (s1 s2 s4 s3 s1 s2 s4 ) = {α1 , α2 , α4 }
and τ (s3 s1 s2 s4 s3 s1 s2 s4 s3 ) = {α3 }. We also have that Vs1 s3 s1 is associated to O1 . Note that
τ (s1 s3 s1 ) = {α1 , α3 }.
   Again, by 3.1 if V s1 s3 s1 is a union of orbital varieties it must include at least one of
Vs1 s2 s4 s3 s1 s2 s4 , Vs3 s1 s2 s4 s3 s1 s2 s4 s3 , which is impossible by proposition 2.3.
   Again, as in the case of B2 , there is no intermediate nilpotent orbit O′ between O1 and
O2 .

3.5. Now we are ready to show
Proposition. In a semi-simple Lie algebra g having a factor not of type An there exists
an orbital variety such that its closure is not a union of orbital varieties.

Proof.
Our proof is based on the previous computations and proposition 2.2.
   Indeed, since orbital variety as well as its closure in a semisimple Lie algebra is just a
direct product of corresponding simple factors, it is enough to prove the proposition for
a simple Lie algebra not of type An . So, let g be a simple Lie algebra not of type An .
   For g of type G2 we have shown the existence of such orbital variety in 3.3.
6                                          ANNA MELNIKOV




   If g is not of type G2 , then there exist I ⊂ Π of type B2 or of type D4 . Let us denote
simple reflections in I as in case of B2 in 3.3 if g is of type Bn , Cn or F4 , and as in case
of D4 in 3.4 otherwise. Let us denote O2 := Otst in the case of B2 and keep the notation
O2 in the case of D4 as in 3.4. Set
                              (
                                s        if g is of type Bn , Cn , or F4 ,
                       wI :=
                                s1 s3 s1 otherwise.
Recall the notion of DI from 2.2 and set dm to be the maximal element of DI . Such
element is unique by the uniqueness of the longest element in W .
    We will show that V wI dm is not a union of orbital varieties.
    By the construction
                                 V wI dm = B(nI ∩wI nI ).          (∗)
Hence for every V such that πI (V) = VwI I one has V ⊃ VwI dm .
    Assume that V wI dm \ VwI dm = ∪Vi for some orbital varieties Vi . By the previous note
                                                     I
                                       πI (V i ) ( V wI .   (∗∗)
                                   I
   Now take some point X ∈ V wI ∩ O2 . Consider it as a point of nI ⊂ n. We denote it by
X̂ when we consider it as a point of g. Then X̂ ∈ V wI dm by (∗). Moreover, OX̂ 6= OwI dm ,
hence, X̂ ∈ V wI dm \VwI dm . By our assumption there exist Vi such that X̂ ∈ Vi . By theorem
2.2 πI (V i ) is a closure of an orbital variety, and by (∗∗) πI (V i ) ( VwI I . Since X ∈ πI (V i )
and there is no intermediate nilpotent orbits between OVwI and O2 (by the notes in the
                                                                I
end of case B2 in 3.3 and of 3.4) we get that πI (V i ) is the closure of some orbital variety
associated to O2 . This contradicts our computations in 3.3, 3.4.
                                                                                                 

3.6. Now let us consider the situation g = sln . Here, as it is shown in [3, 4.1.8], one has
Proposition. Let g = sln . Then for every two nilpotent orbits O1 , O2 such that O2 ( O1
and for every V1 associated to O1 there exist V2 associated to O2 such that V2 ⊂ V 1 .

   Therefore, the argument we use in other cases cannot work for sln . Moreover, modulo
this proposition conjecture 1.2 is equivalent to the equidimensionality of V ∩ O for any O
in the closure of the nilpotent orbit, V is associated to.
   As it is shown in [4, 2.3], if V is a Richardson component (that is its closure is a nilradical
of a standard parabolic subgroup) then its closure is a union of orbital varieties. Note
that in our counterexamples 3.3, 3.4 all the orbital varieties in question are Richardson.
This demonstrates again, that the situation in sln is different from other cases. As well it
is shown in [5, 3.15] that if V is associated to a nilpotent orbit of nilpotent order 2 then
                                         ORBITAL VARIETIES                                               7




its closure is a union of orbital varieties. As we mentioned in 1.2 these results together
with computations for low ranks support conjecture 1.2.
