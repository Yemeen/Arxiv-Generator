                                             0. Introduction
                                                  The rook monoid Rk is the monoid of k × k matrices with entries from {0, 1} and at most
                                             one nonzero entry in each row and column. Recently, the representation theory of its “Iwahori-
                                             Hecke” algebra Rk (q), called the q-rook monoid algebra, has been analyzed. In particular, a
                                             Schur-Weyl type duality on tensor space was found for the q-rook monoid algebra and its irreducible
                                             representations were given explicit combinatorial constructions. In this paper we show that, in fact,
                                             the q-rook monoid algebra is a quotient of the affine Hecke algebra of type A. With this knowledge
                                             in hand, we show that the recent results on the q-rook monoid algebras actually come from known
                                             results about the affine Hecke algebra. In particular

          [AK], and the construction of the irreducible representations of Iwahori-Hecke algebras of
          type B by Hoefsmit [Ho].
      (b) The Schur-Weyl duality for the q-rook monoid algebra discovered by Solomon [So2-4] and
          studied by Halverson [Ha] turns out to be a special case of the Schur-Weyl duality for
          cyclotomic Hecke algebras given by Sakamoto and Shoji [SS].
Though these results show that the representation theory of the q-rook monoid algebra is “just”
a piece of the representation theory of the affine Hecke algebra, this was not at all obvious at the
outset. It was only on the analysis of the recent results in [So4] and [Ha] that the similarity to
affine Hecke algebra theory was noticed. This observation then led us to search for and establish
a concrete connection between these algebras.
     The q-rook monoid algebra was first studied in its q = 1 version in the 1950’s by Munn [Mu1-
2]. Solomon [So1] discovered the general q-version of the algebra as a Hecke algebra (double coset
algebra) for the finite algebraic monoid Mn (Fq ) of n × n matrices over a finite field with q elements,
with respect to the “Borel subgroup” B of invertible upper triangular matrices. Later Solomon
[So2] found a Schur-Weyl duality for Rk (1) in which Rk (1) acts as the centralizer algebra for the
action of the general linear group GLn (C) on V ⊗k where V = L(ε1 ) ⊕ L(0) is the direct sum of
the “fundamental” n-dimensional representation and the trivial module L(0) for GLn (C). Then
Solomon [So3,4] gave a presentation of Rk (q) by generators and relations and defined an action of
Rk (q) on tensor space.
     Halverson [Ha] found a new presentation of Rk (q) and used it to show that Solomon’s action
of Rk (q) on tensor space extends the Schur-Weyl duality so that Rk (q) is the centralizer of the
quantum general linear group Uq gl(n) on V ⊗k where now V = L(ε1 ) ⊕ L(0) is the direct sum of the
“fundamental” and the trivial module for Uq gl(n). Halverson also exploited his new presentation to
construct, combinatorially, all the irreducible representations of Rk (q) when Rk (q) is semisimple.
     The main results of this paper are the following:
     (a) We find yet another presentation (1.6) of Rk (q) by generators and relations.
     (b) Our new presentation shows that

                                             Rk (q) = Hk (0, 1; q)/I,

         where Hk (0, 1; q) is the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Bk with parameters specialized to
         0 and 1, and I is the ideal generated by the minimal ideal of H2 (0, 1; q) corresponding to
         the pair of partitions λ = ((12 ), ∅).
     (c) We show that the irreducible representations of Rk (q) found in [Ha] come from the con-
         structions of irreducible representations of Hk (0, 1; q).
     (d) We use the fact that Rk (q) is a quotient of Hk (0, 1; q) and the fact that the Iwahori-Hecke
         algebra Hk (q) of type Ak−1 is a quotient of Rk (q) to easily determine, in Corollary 2.21,
         the values of q for which Rk (q) is semisimple. These values were first found in [So4] using
         other methods.
     (e) We show that the Schur-Weyl duality between Rk (q) and Uq gl(n) comes from the Schur-
         Weyl duality of Sakamoto and Shoji [SS] for the cyclotomic Hecke algebras (Theorem
         3.5).
     (f) We give a different Schur-Weyl duality for algebras Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) = Hk (u1 , u2 ; q)/I, where
         u1 , u2 6= 0, Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) is the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Bk and I is the ideal
         generated by the minimal ideal of H2 (u1 , u2 ; q) corresponding to the pair of partitions
         λ = ((12 ), ∅). This Schur-Weyl duality comes from the Schur-Weyl duality of Orellana
         and Ram for the affine Hecke algebra (Theorem 3.3).

with relations

     (A2)     Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 ,                             1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2,
     (A3)     Ti Tj = Tj Ti ,                                         |i − j| > 1,

                                                                                                        (1.1)
     (R2)     Pi Pj = Pj Pi ,                                         1 ≤ i, j ≤ k,
     (R3)     Pi Tj = Tj Pi ,                                         1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,
     (R4)     Pi Tj = Tj Pi = qPi ,                                   1 ≤ j < i ≤ k,
     (R5)     Pi+1 = qPi Ti−1 Pi = q(Pi Ti Pi − (q − q −1 )Pi ),      1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.

     The algebra Rk (q) was introduced by Solomon [So1] as an analogue of the Iwahori-Hecke
algebra for the finite algebraic monoid Mk (Fq ) of k × k matrices over a finite field with q elements
with respect to its “Borel subgroup” of invertible upper triangular matrices. The presentation of
Rk (q) given above is due to Halverson [Ha].
     When q = 1, Rk (q) specializes to the algebra of the rook monoid Rk that consists of k × k
matrices with entries from {0, 1} and at most one nonzero entry in each row and column. These
correspond with the possible placements of nonattacking rooks on an k × k chessboard. In this
specialization, Ti becomes the matrix obtained by switching rows i and i + 1 in the identity matrix
I and, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, Pi becomes the matrix Ei+1,i+1 + Ei+1,i+2 + · · · + Ek,k , where Ei,j is the
matrix with a 1 in position (i, j) and zeros elsewhere. The generator Pk specializes to the 0 matrix
(which is not the 0 element in the monoid algebra).

Remark 1.2. The definition of Rk (q) in [So1,3,4] and [Ha] uses generators T̃i in place of Ti . These
generators satisfy T̃i2 = (q − 1)T̃i + q in place of (A1). In our presentation, if we let T̃i = qTi , then
T̃i2 = q 2 ((q − q −1 )Ti + 1) = (q 2 − 1)qTi + q 2 = (q 2 − 1)T̃i + q 2 , which shows that our algebra is the
same except with parameter q 2 instead of q.

     Define
                       Xi = Ti−1 Ti−2 · · · T1 (1 − P1 )T1 T2 · · · Ti−1 ,        1 ≤ i ≤ k,            (1.3)
so that Xi+1 = Ti Xi Ti .

Lemma 1.4. In Rk (q) we have the following relations
(a) Pi Pj = Pj Pi = Pj , for i ≤ j.
(b) P1 X2 = P1 − P2 .
Proof. (a) If i = j this is (R1). If i < j then, by (R5) and induction,

        Pi Pj = Pi (Pj−1 Tj−1 Pj−1 − (q − q −1 )Pj−1 ) = Pj−1 Tj−1 Pj−1 − (q − q −1 )Pj−1 = Pj .

(b) We use relations (A1), (R4), and (R5) to get

                      P1 X2 = P1 T1 (1 − P1 )T1 = P1 T12 − P1 T1 P1 T1
                             = (q − q −1 )P1 T1 + P1 − P1 T1 P1 T1
                             = (q − q −1 )P1 T1 + P1 − q −1 P2 T1 − (q − q −1 )P1 T1
                             = P1 − q −1 P2 T1 = P1 − P2 .


Proposition 1.5. The q-rook monoid algebra Rk (q) is generated by the elements X1 , T1 , . . . , Tk−1 ,
and these elements satisfy the relations (A1), (A2), (A3), and
   (B1) X1 Tj = Tj X1 , for 2 ≤ j ≤ k,
   (B2) X12 = X1 ,
   (B3) X1 T1 X1 T1 = T1 X1 T1 X1 ,
   (B4) (1 − X1 )(T1 − q)(1 − X1 )(1 − X2 ) = 0, where X2 = T1 X1 T1 .

Proof. By (R5), Rn (q) is generated by X1 = 1 − P1 , T1 , . . . , Tk−1 .
(B1) By (R3), X1 Tj = (1 − P1 )Tj = Tj (1 − P1 ) = Tj X1 .
(B2) By (R1), X12 = (1 − P1 )2 = 1 − 2P1 + P12 = 1 − P1 = X1 .
(B3) Using (R4) and (R5),

          q(T1 P1 T1 P1 − (q − q −1 )T1 P1 ) = T1 P2 = P2 T1 = q(P1 T1 P1 T1 − (q − q −1 )P1 T1 ),

and so
                          P1 T1 P1 T1 = T1 P1 T1 P1 + (q − q −1 )(P1 T1 − T1 P1 ).                       (∗)
Now, using (∗) and (A1),

     X1 T1 X1 T1 = (1 − P1 )T1 (1 − P1 )T1
                  = T12 − P1 T12 − T1 P1 T1 + P1 T1 P1 T1
                  = T12 − (q − q −1 )P1 T1 − P1 − T1 P1 T1 + T1 P1 T1 P1 + (q − q −1 )(P1 T1 − T1 P1 )
                  = T12 − P1 − T1 P1 T1 + T1 P1 T1 P1 − (q − q −1 )T1 P1
                  = T12 − T12 P1 − T1 P1 T1 + T1 P1 T1 P1
                  = T1 (1 − P1 )T1 (1 − P1 )
                  = T1 X1 T1 X1 .

Finally, to show (B4), we use Lemma 1.4(b),

         (1 − X1 )(T1 − q)(1 − X1 )(1 − X2 ) = P1 (T1 − q)P1 (1 − X2 )
                                               = P1 T1 P1 − qP1 − P1 T1 P1 X2 + qP1 X2
                                               = P1 T1 P1 − qP1 − P1 T1 (P1 − P2 ) + q(P1 − P2 )
                                               = −qP2 + P1 T1 P2
                                               = −qP2 + qP1 P2         by (R4)
                                               = −qP2 + qP2          by Lemma 1.4(a)
                                               = 0.

  (B4′ ) P22 = P2 .
Proof. Subtracting Tj from each side of

                  Tj − P1 Tj = (1 − P1 )Tj = X1 Tj = Tj X1 = Tj (1 − P1 ) = Tj − Tj P1 ,

shows that (B1) is equivalent to (B1′ ). Relations (B2) and (B2′ ) are equivalent since

                                1 − P1 = X1 = X12 = (1 − P1 )2 = 1 − 2P1 + P12 .

Since

X1 T1 X1 T1 = (1 − P1 )T1 (1 − P1 )T1 = (1 − P1 )T12 − T1 P1 T1 + P1 T1 P1 T1
              = (1 − P1 )((q − q −1 )T1 + 1) − T1 P1 T1 + (q −1 P2 + (q − q −1 )P1 )T1                  (by (A1) and (1.7))
                         −1                      −1                                    −1

              = (q − q −1 )T1 + 1 − P1 − T1 P1 T1 + q −1 P2 T1

is equal to

T1 X1 T1 X1 = T1 (1 − P1 )T1 (1 − P1 ) = T12 (1 − P1 ) − T1 P1 T1 + T1 P1 T1 P1
              = ((q − q −1 )T1 + 1)(1 − P1 ) − T1 P1 T1 + T1 (q −1 P2 + (q − q −1 )P1 )                 (by (A1) and (1.7))
                         −1                      −1                                    −1

              = (q − q −1 )T1 + 1 − P1 − T1 P1 T1 + q −1 T1 P2 ,

(B3) is equivalent to (B3′ ).

and so (1 − X1 )(T1 − q)(1 − X2 )(1 − X1 ) = 0 if and only if P22 = P2 . Thus (B4) is equivalent to
(B4′ ).


Proposition 1.9. The algebra Ak (q) is generated by T1 , . . . , Tk−1 , P1 , . . . , Pk , and these elements
satisfy the relations (A1), (A2), (A3), and
    (E1) Pi Tj = Tj Pi , for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,
    (E2) Pi Pj = Pj Pi = Pi , for all 1 ≤ j < i ≤ k,
    (E3) Pi2 = Pi , for 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
    (E4) Pi Tj = Tj Pi = qPi , for 1 ≤ j < i ≤ k,
    (E5) Pi+1 = qPi Ti−1 Pi = q(Pi Ti Pi − (q − q −1 )Pi ), for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
Proof. Since X1 = 1 − P1 , the elements T1 , . . . , Tn−1 , P1 generate Ak (q). Relation (E5) is the
definition of Pi+1 .
     We prove (E1) by induction on i. The case i = 1 is (B1′ ). Assume that j > i + 1 > 1, then Tj
commutes with Pi by induction and Tj commutes with Ti by (A3), so

           Tj Pi+1 = q −1 Tj Pi Tj Pi − (q − q −1 )Tj Pi = q −1 Pi Tj Pi Tj − (q − q −1 )Pi Tj = Pi+1 Tj ,

proving (E1).
     We now prove (E2)-(E4) collectively by induction on i. The case i = 1 for (E2) follows from
(B2′ ) since

                   P2 P1 = q(P1 T1 P1 − (q − q −1 )P1 )P1 = q(P1 T1 P1 − (q − q −1 )P1 ) = P2 .                               (∗)

The relation P1 P2 = P2 is similar. The first two cases of (E3) are (B2′ ) and (B4′ ). The i = 1 case
of (E4) follows from (B4′ ) since

                               P22 = P2 q(P1 T1 P1 − (q − q −1 )P1 )
                                   = q(P2 T1 P1 − (q − q −1 )P2 )          (by (∗))
                                                            −1
                                   = q(T1 P2 P1 − (q − q         )P2 )     (by (B3′ ))
                                   = q(T1 P2 − (q − q −1 )P2 )           (by (∗)).

Since P22 = P2 , we have T1 P2 = qP2 . The case P2 T1 = qP2 is similar.
    Now fix i > 1 and assume the following relations,
  (E2∗ ) Pi Pj = Pj Pi = Pi , for all 1 ≤ j < i,
  (E3∗ ) Pi2 = Pi ,
  (E4∗ ) Pi Tj = Tj Pi = qPi , for 1 ≤ j < i,
We show each of these relations for i + 1.
    For (E2) we use (E3∗ ) to get

                 Pi+1 Pi = q(Pi Ti Pi2 − (q − q −1 )Pi2 ) = q(Pi Ti Pi − (q − q −1 )Pi ) = Pi+1 ,

and when j < i, we use (E2∗ ) to get

               Pi+1 Pj = q(Pi Ti Pi Pj − (q − q −1 )Pi Pj ) = q(Pi Ti Pi − (q − q −1 )Pi ) = Pi+1 .

The relations Pi Pi+1 = Pi+1 and Pj Pi+1 = Pi+1 are similar, and so (E2) is established.
    To establish (E3), let i > 2 (note that we have established i = 1, 2),

    = Pi+1 .

    Finally, we prove (E4). First let j < i. Then, by (E4∗ ),

             Pi+1 Tj = q(Pi Ti Pi Tj − (q − q −1 )Pi Tj ) = q(qPi Ti Pi − (q − q −1 )qPi ) = qPi+1 ,

2. Hecke algebras


The affine Hecke algebra H̃k
    Fix q ∈ C∗ . The affine Hecke algebra H̃k is the algebra given by generators

                                      X 1 , . . . , Xk        and          T1 , . . . , Tk−1

with relations

         (1)     Ti Tj = Tj Ti ,                              |i − j| > 1,
         (2)     Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 ,                  1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2,
         (3)     Ti2 = (q − q −1 )Ti + 1,                     1 ≤ i ≤ k,
         (4)     Xi Xj = Xj Xi ,                              1 ≤ i, j ≤ k,
         (5)     Xi Ti = Ti Xi+1 + (q − q −1 )Xi ,            1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.

It follows from relations (3) and (5) that

                            Xi = Ti−1 · · · T2 T1 X1 T1 T2 · · · Ti−1 ,                for 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
                        rook monoid algebras and hecke algebras                                       9

and from (4) that
         (6) X1 T1 X1 T1 = T1 X1 T1 X1 .

In fact, H̃k can be presented as the algebra generated by X1 and T1 , . . . , Tk−1 with relations (1-3)
and (6).
     Let
                    [k]! = [1][2] · · · [k], where   [i] = 1 + q 2 + · · · + q 2(i−1) .
When [k]! 6= 0 a large class of irreducible representations of the affine Hecke algebra H̃k (q), the
integrally calibrated irreducible representations, have a simple combinatorial construction. An H̃k -
module M is integrally calibrated if M has a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors for X1 , X2 , . . . , Xk
for which the eigenvalues are all of the form q j with j ∈ Z. The construction of these H̃k -modules is
originally due to Cherednik [Ch] (see [Ra] for greater detail) and is a generalization of the classical
seminormal construction of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group by A. Young.
Young’s construction had been generalized to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of classical type (see Theorem
2.8 below) by Hoefsmit [Ho] in 1974.
      To describe the construction we shall use the notations of [Mac] for partitions so that a
partition is identified with a collection of boxes in a corner, ℓ(λ) is the number of rows of λ, and
|λ| is the number of boxes in λ. For example, the partition


                     λ = (5, 5, 3, 1, 1) =            has ℓ(λ) = 5 and |λ| = 15.


    If λ is a partition that is obtained from µ by adding k boxes let λ/µ be the skew shape
consisting of those boxes of λ that are not in µ. A standard tableau of shape λ/µ is a filling of the
boxes of λ/µ with 1, 2, . . . , k such that
     (a) the entries in the rows increase left to right, and
     (b) the entries in the columns increase top to bottom.
If b is a box in λ/µ define

                         CT (b) = q 2(c−r) ,    if b is in position (r, c) of λ.                  (2.1)


Theorem 2.2. ([Ch], see also [Ra, Theorem 4.1], and [OR, Theorem 6.20a]) Assume that [k]! 6= 0.
Then the calibrated irreducible representations H λ/µ of the affine Hecke algebra H̃k are indexed
by skew shapes and can be given explicitly as the vector space

                    H λ/µ = C-span{vL | L is a standard tableau of shape λ/µ}

Remark 2.3. In [OR] it is explained how the basis vL of H λ/µ and the action of H̃k in Theorem
2.2 can be derived in a natural way from the general mechanism of quantum groups (R-matrices,
quantum Casimirs, the tensor product rule in (3.1)) and a Schur-Weyl duality theorem (Theorem
3.3 below) for the affine Hecke algebra.


The cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hk (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)
     Let u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C and q ∈ C∗ . The cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hk (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) is the quotient
of the affine Hecke algebra H̃k by the ideal generated by the relation

                                         (X1 − u1 )(X1 − u2 ) · · · (X1 − ur ) = 0.                        (2.4)

The algebra Hk (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) is a deformation of the group algebra of the complex reflection group
G(r, 1, k) = (Z/rZ) ≀ Sk and is of dimension dim(Hk (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)) = r k k!. These algebras were
introduced by Ariki and Koike [AK]. Ariki has generalized the classical result of Gyoja and Uno
[GU] and given precise conditions for the semisimplicity of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras.

Theorem 2.5. ([Ar]) The algebra Hk (u1 , , . . . , ur ; q) is semisimple if and only if

                   q 2d ui 6= uj for all −k < d < k, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r,                and        [k]! 6= 0,

where [k]! = [1][2] · · · [k] and [i] = 1 + q 2 + · · · + q 2(i−1) .

Proof. Let us only explain the conversion between the statement in [Ar] and the statement here.
This conversion is the same as in Remark 1.2. If T̃i = qTi then T̃i2 = q 2 ((q − q −1 )Ti + 1) =
(q 2 − 1)qTi + q 2 = (q 2 − 1)T̃i + q 2 , which shows that our algebra is the same as Ariki’s except with
parameter q 2 .

     Ariki and Koike give a combinatorial construction of the irreducible representations of the
cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hk (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) when it is semisimple. Define
                    (r)
                  Ĥk = {r-tuples λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r) ) of partitions with k boxes total}.            (2.6)
            (r)
Let λ ∈ Ĥk . A standard tableau of shape λ is a filling of the boxes of λ with 1, 2, . . . , k such that
for each λ(i) , 1 ≤ i ≤ r,
     (a) the entries in the rows are increasing left to right, and
     (b) the entries in the columns are increasing top to bottom.
Let L(i) denote the the box of L containing i, and define

                      CT (b) = ui q 2(c−r) ,             if the box b is in position (r, c) of λ(i) .      (2.7)

It is interesting to note that Theorem 2.8 is almost an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.2.

The Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) of type Bk
     The Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Bk is the cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hk (u1 , u2 ; q). Thus,
for u1 , u2 ∈ C and q ∈ C∗ , Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) is the quotient of the affine Hecke algebra by the ideal
generated by the relation
                                       (X1 − u1 )(X1 − u2 ) = 0.                                 (2.9)
The algebra Hk (1, −1; q) is the group algebra of the Weyl group of type Bk (the hyperoctahedral
group of signed permutations).
    In the case of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) of type Bk Theorem 2.8 is due to
Hoefsmit [Ho]. When Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) is semisimple Hoefsmit’s construction of the irreducible repre-
sentations of Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) implies that, as Hk−1 (u1 , u2 ; q)-modules

             (X1 − u2 )(T1 − q)(X1 − u2 )(X2 − u2 ), if u1 = 0,

Proof. Using the construction of the simple H2 (u1 , u2 ; q)-modules in Theorem 2.8 it is not tedious
to check that, when u1 6= 0,

                                                                                                                2                                                                  2
Thus p is an element of the ideal I ((1                                                                               ),∅)

Theorem 2.17. Assume Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) is semisimple.
(a) Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is semisimple.

(b) As in (2.14) let hI ((1 ),∅) ik be the ideal of Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) generated by the minimal ideal I ((1                         ),∅)

    of H2 (u1 , u2 ; q). Then

                                                            =                 Mdλ (C).
                                                                      λ∈Âk


(d) The irreducible Ak (u1 , u2 ; q)-modules H λ , λ ∈ Âk , are given by Hoefsmit’s construction (The-
    orem 2.8).
(e) The Bratelli diagram for the sequence of algebras A1 (u1 , u2 ; q) ⊆ A2 (u1 , u2 ; q) ⊆ · · · ⊆
    Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) has vertices on level m indexed by λ ∈ Âm and edges λ ←→ λ− if λ− is ob-
    tained from λ by removing a box. See Figure 2.
Proof. (a) follows from the fact that Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is a quotient of Hk (u1 , u2 ; q).
                                                                                  2
(b) By Lemma 2.15, the element p generates the ideal hI ((1                           ),∅)
                                                                                             i in Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) and so this is a
consequence of the definition of Ak (u1 , u2 ; q).
(c) By (2.14)                                                         M
                                                2
                                           hI ((1   ),∅)
                                                           ik =                 I λ,                                        (2.18)
                                                                  λ⊇((12 ),∅)

and so, by (b) and (2.13), the simple components of Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) are indexed by those elements of
      (2)
λ ∈ Ĥk which do not contain ((12 ), ∅). These are exactly the elements of Âk .

                          Figure 2. Bratteli Diagram of Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) and Rk (q)

     By construction it is clear that the Bratteli diagram for Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is a subgraph of the
Bratteli diagram for Hk (u1 , u2 ; q). It is the subgraph which is obtained by removing all pairs
of partitions λ = (λ(1) , λ(2) ) which appear in (2.18) (for all k). Thus, it is the subgraph which
is obtained by removing the vertex ((12 ), ∅) and all its descendants, i.e., all pairs of partitions
λ = (λ(1) , λ(2) ) which are obtained by adding boxes to ((12 ), ∅).

Theorem 2.19. The algebra Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is semisimple if and only if

                           q 2d u1 6= u2 for all −k < d < k,                                                                                                                   and                                                    [k]! 6= 0,

where [k]! = [1][2] · · · [k] and [i] = 1 + q 2 + · · · + q 2(i−1) .
Proof. Since Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is a quotient of Hk (u1 , u2 ; q), we know that Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is semisimple
when Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) is. Thus Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is semisimple when (a) and (b) hold.
     The Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hk (q) of type Ak−1 is the cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hk (1, 1; q).
Thus, Hk (q) is the quotient Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) by the relation X1 = u1 . By Theorem 2.5 (in this case
orginally due to Gyoja and Uno) Hk (q) is semisimple if and only if [k]! 6= 0. Since Hk (q) is a
quotient of Ak (u1 , u2 ; q), the algebra Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is not semisimple when Hk (q) is not semisimple.
Thus, Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is not semisimple when [k]! = 0.
     If u1 = u2 then the representation ρ: Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) → M2 (C) given by setting

                                                                        0                     u1                                                                                                                                      0       q

is an indecomposable representation which is not irreducible. Thus Ak (u1 , u1 ; q) is not semisimple.
      The Tits deformation theorem (see [CR, (68.17)]) says that the algebra Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) has the
same structure for any choice of the parameters u1 , u2 for which it is semisimple. Assume that
[k]! 6= 0 and u2 = q 2d u1 , u1 6= 0. Let λ/µ be the skew shape given by λ = (k − 1, d) and µ = (d − 1)
and define
                    CT (b) = u1 q 2(c−r)+2 ,      if b is a box in position (r, c) of λ.
With these definitions the formulas in Theorem 2.2 define an Hk (u1 , q 2d u1 ; q)-module H λ/µ . A
check that
                          (X1 − q 2d u1 )(X2 − q 2d u1 )(X2 − q 2 u1 )vL = 0,

for all standard tableaux L of shape λ/µ shows that that H λ/µ is an Ak (u1 , q 2d u1 ; q)-module. The
standard proof (see [Ra, Theorem 4.1]) of Theorem 2.5 applies in this case to show that H λ/µ is
an irreducible Ak (u1 , q 2d u1 ; q)-module. It has dimension
                                                                                

            dim(H         ) = (the number of standard tableaux of shape λ/µ) =     − 1.
                                                                                d

When we restrict this Ak (u1 , q 2d u1 ; q)-module to Hk (q), it is a direct sum of irreducible Hk (q)-
modules indexed by partitions ν ⊢ k with multiplicity given by the classical Littlewood-Richardson
coefficient cλµν (see [Ra, Theorem 6.1]). Since λ = (k − 1, d) and µ = (d − 1) we have cλµν 6= 0 only if
ν has ≤ 2 rows and cλµν = 0 when ν = (k). So H λ/µ is an irreducible Ak (u1 , q 2 du1 ; q)-module such
that upon restriction to Hk (q) is a direct sum of irreducible representations indexed by partitions
with length ≤ 2, and which does not contain the “trivial” representation of Hk (q).
       When Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is semisimple its irreducible representations H λ are indexed by pairs of
parititions λ = (λ(1) , λ(2) ) such that λ(1) has at most one row. If λ(1) has length r, then, on
restriction to Hk (q), H λ is a direct sum of irreducibles indexed by partitions ν ⊢ k with multiplicites
cνλ(1) λ(2) . By the Pieri rule [Mac, (5.16)] the resulting ν are those obtained by adding a horizontal
strip of length r to λ(2) . Only when λ(2) has a single row will all the ν have ≤ 2 rows and, in this
case, cνλ(1) λ(2) = cν(r),(k−r) = 1 for ν = (k). Thus, when Ak (u1 , u2 ; q) is semisimple every irreducible
representation which, on restriction to Hk (q), decomposes as a direct sum of components indexed
by partitions with ≤ 2 rows does contain the “trivial” representation of Hk (q).
       Thus, the Tits deformation theorem implies that Ak (u1 , q 2d u1 ; q) is not semisimple.


Remark 2.20. It is interesting to note that the blob algebras (see [MW]) are also quotients of
Ak (u1 , u2 ; q).

The q-rook monoid algebras Rk (q)
     The new presentation of the q-rook monoid given in Section 1 shows that

                                           Rk (q) = Ak (0, 1; q),

and thus Rk (q) is a quotient of Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hn (0, 1; q) of type Bk .

Corollary 2.21.
(a) The q-rook monoid algebra Rk (q) is semisimple if and only if [k]q ! 6= 0.
(b) If Rk (q) is semisimple then the irreducible representations of Rk (q) are indexed by λ ∈ Âk (see
(2.16)) and are given explicitly by the construction in Theorem 2.8.

     Part (a) of Corollary 2.21 is Theorem 2.19 applied to Rk (q) and (b) is Theorem 2.17(e) for
Rk (q). Part (a) was proved in a different way by Solomon [So4] and part (b) is the result of
Halverson [Ha, Theorem 3.2] which was the catalyst for the results of this paper.
     As in (2.10) it follows that, as Rk−1 (q)-modules

(b) The H̃k action on L(µ) ⊗ V ⊗k commutes with the Uq gl(n)-action and the map

                         Φ: H̃k −→ EndUq gl(n) (L(µ) ⊗ V ⊗k )             is surjective.

where the sum is over all partitions λ which are obtained from µ by adding k boxes and H λ/µ is
a simple H̃k -module.
(d) The representation Φ given in part (a) is a representation of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra

A Schur-Weyl duality for Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type B
      Suppose that µ is a partition with two addable boxes, i.e.
                          (
                    µ=     d                      = ℓd ,      for some 0 < d ≤ n, ℓ ∈ Z≥0 .

Proposition 3.5. Let µ = ℓd , 0 < d ≤ n, ℓ ∈ Z≥0 . Then Theorem 3.3(d) provides a Schur-Weyl
duality for Hk (u1 , u2 ; q) with u1 = q 2ℓ and u2 = q 2d .
Proof. One only needs to note that if b1 , b2 are the addable boxes of µ and CT (b) is as defined in
(2.1) then

the Schur-Weyl duality in Theorem 3.3 becomes a Schur-Weyl duality for the algebra

Proposition 3.7. Let µ = (n−1)d . Then the H̃k action on L(µ)⊗V ⊗k which is given by Theorem
3.3 factors through the algebra Ak (u1 , u2 ; q), where u1 = q 2(n−1) and u2 = q 2ℓ .
Proof. By Theorem 3.3(d), the H̃k action on L(µ) ⊗ V ⊗k factors through the algebra Hk (u1 , u2 ; q)
where u1 = q 2(n−1) and u2 = q 2ℓ . It remains to check that (X1 − u2 )(X2 − u2 )X2 − q 2 u1 ) = 0 as
operators on L(µ)⊗V ⊗k . To do this it is sufficient to show that (X1 −u2 )(X2 −u2 )X2 −q 2 u1 ) = 0 as
operators on H λ for each H λ which appears in the decomposition (3.6). The Hk (u1 , u2 ; q)-module
H λ has basis indexed by the standard tableaux L of shape λ and

     (X1 − u2 )(X2 − u2 )(X2 − q 2 u1 )vL = (CT (L(1)) − u2 )(CT (L(2)) − u2 )(CT (L(2)) − q 2 u1 )vL .

For each of the possible positions of the first two boxes of L at least one of the factors in the last
product is 0. Thus (X1 − u2 )(X2 − u2 )X2 − q 2 u1 ) = 0 as operators on H λ .

Another Schur-Weyl duality for cyclotomic Hecke algebras

where L(j) (λ(j) ) is the simple Uq (gl(mj ))-module correspnding to the partition λ(j) , and H λ is a

Remark 3.11. The Hk (u1 , . . . , uk ; q)-module H λ appearing in Theorem 3.10(c) is simple when-
ever Hk (u1 , . . . , uk ; q) is semisimple. In that case H λ coincides with the Hk (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-module
constructed in Theorem 2.8.

                V = V1 ⊕ V2          where        V1 = Cv0 ,      and V2 = C-span{v1 , . . . , vn }.
  Let us analyze the action of Hk (0, 1; q) on V ⊗k as given by Sakamoto and Shoji. Since dv0 =
  u1 v0 = 0,
                                ΦP (X1 )(v0 ⊗ vi2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vik ) = 0,
  and, for ℓ > 0,

             ΦP (X1 )(vℓ ⊗ vi2 · · · ⊗ vik ) = Ř1−1 · · · Řk−1
                                                             −1
                                                                 Šk−1 · · · Š1 d1 (vℓ ⊗ vi2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vik )
                                              = Ř1−1 · · · Řk−1
                                                              −1
                                                                  Šk−1 · · · Š1 (vℓ ⊗ vi2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vik )
                                              = Ř1−1 · · · Řk−1
                                                              −1
                                                                  Řk−1 · · · Ř1 (vℓ ⊗ vi2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vik )
                                              = vℓ ⊗ vi2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vik ,

  and thus ΦP (X1 ) = d1 . This calculation shows that the Sakamoto-Shoji action of Hk (0, 1; q)
  coincides exactly with action for the Schur-Weyl duality for the q-rook monoid algebra Rk (q) in
  the form given by Halverson [Ha, Corollary 6.3].
