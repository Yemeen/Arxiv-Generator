                                                            Canonical basic sets for Hecke algebras

                                                     Abstract. We give an explicit description of the “canonical basic set” for
                                                     all Iwahori-Hecke algebras of finite Weyl groups in “good” characteristic. We
                                                     obtain a complete classification of simple modules for this type of algebras.

                                                 Let W be a finite Weyl group with set of simple reflections S ⊂ W and let
                                             H be the generic Iwahori-Hecke algebra of W over A = Z[v, v −1 ], where v is an
                                             indeterminate. Let u := v 2 . H has a basis {Tw | w ∈ W } and we have the following
                                             multiplication rules. Let s ∈ S and w ∈ W , then:
                                                                         (
                                                                           Tsw                 if l(sw) > l(w),
                                                                Ts Tw =
                                                                           uTsw + (u − 1)Tw if l(sw) < l(w),
                                             where l is the usual length function. Let K be the field of fractions of A and let
                                             θ : A → k be a homomorphism into a field k such that k is the field of fractions of
                                             θ(A) and such that θ(v) has finite order.
                                                  Let HK := K ⊗A H and let Hk := k ⊗A H. It is known that HK is a split
                                             semi-simple algebra, isomorphic to the group algebra K[W ] and that the simple HK -
                                             modules are in natural bijection with the simple modules of K[W ]. The problem of
                                             determining a parametrization of the simple Hk -modules is much more complicated.
                                             To solve this problem, it is convenient to use the notion of decomposition map,
                                             which relates the simple HK -modules with the simple Hk -modules via a process
                                             of modular reduction. We obtain a well-defined decomposition map between the
                                             Grothendieck groups of finitely generated HK -modules and Hk -modules:
                                                                             dθ : R0 (HK ) → R0 (Hk ).
                                             Assume that the characteristic of k is either 0 or a good prime for W . Then, in [G3]
                                             and in [GR2], M.Geck and R.Rouquier have defined a canonical set B ⊂ Irr(HK )
                                             by using Lusztig’s a-function. This set is called the “canonical basic set” and it is
                                             in natural bijection with Irr(Hk ). Hence, it gives a way to parametrize the simple
                                             Hk -modules. Moreover, the existence of the canonical basic set implies that the
                                             decomposition matrix of dθ has a lower triangular shape with 1 along the diagonal.
                                                 In characteristic 0, the canonical basic set has been completely described for
                                             type An−1 in [G3], for type Bn in [J3] and for type Dn in [G2] and [J1]. Moreover,

this set can be easily deduced for the exceptional types from the explicit tables of
decomposition numbers obtained by M.Geck, K.Lux and J.Müller. The aim of
this paper is to report these results and to show that the parametrization of B
in characteristic 0 holds in “good” characteristic. We note that the existence of
“basic sets” has been also proved for the class of cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type
G(d, 1, n) in [J3] and recently, for the class of cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type
G(d, p, n) in [GJ].
     The paper is organized as follows. In the first part, we recall the definition of
the canonical basic set. Next, in the second part, we give some useful properties of
the decomposition map and we show that the problem of determining the canonical
basic set can be reduced to the case of characteristic 0. We finally give an explicit
description of the canonical basic set for all Hecke algebras of finite Weyl groups
and for all specializations.

                      2. Existence of canonical basic sets
     2.1. Decomposition maps. Let H be an Iwahori-Hecke algebra of a finite
Weyl group W over A := Z[v, v −1 ] as it is defined in the introduction. Let K = Q(v)
and let HK be the corresponding Hecke algebra. Then A is integrally closed in K
and HK is a split semi-simple algebra. Let θ : A → k be a specialization into a
field k such that k is the field of fractions of θ(A) and such that θ(v) has finite
order. We assume that the characteristic of k is 0 or a good prime number for W .
Then, there exists a discrete valuation ring O with maximal ideal J(O) such that
A ⊂ O and J(O) ∩ A = ker θ. By [GP, Theorem 7.4.3], we obtain a well-defined
decomposition map
                               dθ : R0 (HK ) → R0 (Hk ).
This is defined as follows: let V be a simple HK -module. Then, by [GP, section
7.4], there exists a HO -module Vb such that K ⊗O Vb = V . By reducing Vb modulo
the maximal ideal of O, we obtain a HkO -module where kO is the residue field of
O. We obtain a map:
                              d′θ : R0 (HK ) → R0 (HkO ).
Since Hk is split and since kO can be seen as an extension field of k, we can
identify R0 (HkO ) with R0 (Hk ). We obtain the desired decomposition map dθ be-
tween R0 (HK ) and R0 (Hk ). Moreover, for V ∈ Irr(HK ), there exist numbers
(dV,M )M∈Irr(Hk ) such that:
                                           X
                            dθ ([V ]) =           dV,M [M ].
                                      M∈Irr(Hk )

The matrix (dV,M ) V ∈Irr(HK ) is called the decomposition matrix. For more details
                    M ∈Irr(Hk )

about the construction of decomposition maps, see [G4].
    2.2. Canonical basic sets. In this part, we recall the results of [G3] and
[GR2] which show that the above decomposition matrix has always a lower uni-
triangular shape. First, we need to attach non negative integers which are called
“a-values” to the simple modules of HK and Hk as follows.
    Let {Cw }w∈W be the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of H. For x, y ∈ W , the multipli-
cation between two elements of this basis is given by:
                                       X
                              Cx Cy =       hx,y,z Cz
                                        z∈W
                   CANONICAL BASIC SETS FOR HECKE ALGEBRAS                           3


where hx,y,z ∈ A for all z ∈ W . For any z ∈ W , there is a well-defined integer
a(z) ≥ 0 such that
                       v a(z) hx,y,z ∈ Z[v] for all x, y ∈ W,
                       v a(z)−1 hx,y,z ∈
                                       / Z[v] for some x, y ∈ W.
We obtain a function which is called the Lusztig’s a-function:
                                  a: W       →    N
                                     z       7 → a(z)
Now, following [L, Lemma 1.9], to any M ∈ Irr(Hk ), we can attach an a-value
a(M ) by the requirement that:
                  Cw .M = 0 for all w ∈ W with a(w) > a(M ),
                  Cw .M 6= 0 for some w ∈ W with a(w) = a(M ).
We can also attach an a-value a(V ) to any V ∈ Irr(HK ), in an analogous way.
    We can now give the theorem of existence of the canonical basic set. The main
tool of the proof is the Lusztig’s asymptotic algebra.
    Theorem 2.1 (M.Geck [G3], M.Geck-R.Rouquier [GR2]). Recall that we as-
sume that the characteristic of k is 0 or a good prime for W . We define the following
subset of Irr(HK ):
    B := {V ∈ Irr(HK ) | dV,M 6= 0 and a(V ) = a(M ) for some M ∈ Irr(Hk )}.
Then there exists a unique bijection
                                  Irr(Hk ) → B
                                     M     7→ VM
such that the following two conditions hold:
     (1) For all VM ∈ B, we have dVM ,M = 1 and a(VM ) = a(M ).
     (2) If V ∈ Irr(HK ) and M ∈ Irr(Hk ) are such that dV,M 6= 0, then we have
         a(M ) ≤ a(V ), with equality only for V = VM .
The set B is called the canonical basic set with respect to the specialization θ.
     Hence, to find the elements of the canonical basic set, for each M ∈ Irr(Hk ),
we have to search for VM ∈ Irr(HK ) such that a(VM ) = a(M ) and dVM ,M 6= 0.
     Note that a description of the set B would lead to a natural parametrization of
the set of simple Hk -modules. If Hk is semi-simple, we know by Tits deformation
theorem that the decomposition matrix is just the identity. Hence, we obtain the
following result.
   Proposition 2.2. Assume that θ is such that Hk is a split semi-simple algebra.
Then, we have:
                              B = Irr(HK ).
    We now want to give an explicit description of B in the non semi-simple case.
By [GP, Theorem 7.4.7], Hk is semi-simple unless θ(u) is a root of unity. Thus,
we can restrict ourselves to the case where θ(u) is a root of unity. In the next
section, we will see that it is sufficient to know the canonical basic set when the
characteristic of k is 0.

              3. Canonical basic sets in positive characteristic
     In this section, we assume that p is a “good” prime number for W . Let θp :
A → kp be a specialization into a field kp of characteristic p such that kp is the field
of fractions of θp (A). We obtain a decomposition map
                              dθp : R0 (HK ) → R0 (Hkp ).
      p
Let B be the canonical basic set associated to θp as it is defined in Theorem 2.1.
By Proposition 2.2, we can assume that θp (u) is a root of unity. We put:
           e := min{i ≥ 2 | 1 + θp (u) + θp (u)2 + ... + θp (u)i−1 = 0} ∈ N.
    We first show that the decomposition matrix of dθp can be obtained in two steps:
one step from u to a eth -root of unity over C and another step from characteristic
0 to characteristic p.
    Following [G5], we denote p := ker θp . Let Φe (u) ∈ Z[u] be the eth cyclotomic
polynomial. We have Φe (u) ∈ p and :
          Φe (u) = Φ2e (v)                                         if e is even,
          Φe (u) = Φe (v)Φ2e (v) and Φ2e (v) = ±Φe (−v)            if e is odd.
Thus, choosing a suitable square root of θp (u) in kp , we can assume that Φ2e (v) ∈ p.
Let q ⊂ A be the prime ideal generated by Φ2e (v). We have A/q ≃ Z[η2e ] where η2e
is a primitive 2eth root of unity. Then, since A/q is integrally closed in k0 := Q(η2e )
and since Hk0 is split, the natural map θ0 : A → A/q induces a decomposition map
                              dθ0 : R0 (HK ) → R0 (Hk0 ).
Similary, the canonical map π : A/q → A/p induces a decomposition map

                            dπ : R0 (Hk0 ) → R0 (Hkp ).
The following result shows that dθp is entirely determined by dθ0 and dπ .
   Proposition 3.1 (Factorization of decomposition maps, M.Geck-R.Rouquier
[GR1]). The following diagram is commutative:

                                         dθp
                             R0 (HK )                  ✲R0 (Hk )
                                                              p

                                   ❅                    ✒
                                  dθ0 ❅                dπ
                                       ❅
                                        ❘
                                        ❅
                                        R0 (Hk0 )

If Dθ0 , Dθp and Dπ are the decomposition matrices associated to θ0 , θp and π
respectively, we have:
                               Dθp = Dθ0 Dπ .
    Now, by Theorem 2.1, we have a canonical basic set B p ⊂ Irr(HK ) associated
to the specialization θp and a canonical basic set B 0 ⊂ Irr(HK ) associated to θ0 .
     Theorem 3.2 (M.Geck-R.Rouquier [GR1], [G5]). Assume that the character-
istic of kp is good. Then, we have:
                               | Irr(Hkp )| = | Irr(Hk0 )|.
                   CANONICAL BASIC SETS FOR HECKE ALGEBRAS                                5


Hence, we have:
                                       |B p | = |B 0 |
    We can now give the main result of this section. Note that another proof of this
theorem can be found in [J2, chapter 3]. The author wants to thank the referee for
suggesting him this more elementary proof.
    Theorem 3.3. Assume that the characteristic of kp is good. Then, we have:
                                        Bp = B0
    Proof. Let M ∈ Irr(Hkp ) and let V := VM ∈ B p ⊂ Irr(HK ) be the associated
element of the canonical basic set as in Theorem 2.1. In R0 (Hkp ), we have:
               dθp ([V ]) = [M ] + lower terms with respect to a − value
with a(V ) = a(M ). Then, by the factorization of the decomposition map, there is
a simple Hk0 -module M such that:
       • [M ] ∈ R0 (Hk0 ) appears in dθ0 ([V ]) with non zero coefficient,
       • [M ] ∈ R0 (Hkp ) appears in dπ ([M ]) with non zero coefficient.
Then
                           a(M ) = a(V ) ≥ a(M ) ≥ a(M ),
together with the characterization of VM in Theorem 2.1 implies that V = VM ∈ B 0 .
By Theorem 3.2, we have |B| = |B p |. Thus, we obtain:
                                         B = Bp.
                                                                                         
    Hence, it is sufficient to determine the canonical basic set in characteristic 0 to
describe the canonical basic set in “good” characteristic.

                  4. Description of the canonical basic sets
    4.1. FLOTW multipartitions. The canonical basic set has been explicitly
computed for all types and all specializations in characteristic 0. In this part, we
recall the parametrizations of these sets and we use Theorem 3.3 to compute the
canonical basic set in “good” characteristic.
    In [J3], the existence of a “canonical basic set” has been proved for another type
of algebras known as Ariki-Koike algebras (or cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type
G(d, 1, n)). This type of algebras can be seen as an analogue of Hecke algebras for
complex reflection groups. Moreover, this canonical basic set has been explicitely
described and can be parametrized by some FLOTW multipartitions arising from
a crystal graph studied by Foda et al. [FL] and Jimbo et al. [JM]. The key of
the proof is the Ariki’s theory [A] relating decomposition numbers with canonical
basis of Fock space.
    Let v0 , v1 ,..., vd−1 be integers such that 0 ≤ v0 ≤ ... ≤ vd−1 < e. For d ∈ N,
we say that λ is a d-partition of rank n if:
                                                                          (i)      (i)
       • λ = (λ(0) , .., λ(d−1) ) where, for i = 0, ..., d − 1, λ(i) = (λ1 , ..., λri ) is a
                                               (i)           (i)
         partition of rank |λ(i) | such that λ1 ≥ ... ≥ λri > 0,

       •     |λ(k) | = n.

We denote by Πdn the set of d-partitions of rank n. To define the FLOTW d-
partitions, we must introduce some notations. Let λ = (λ(0) , ..., λ(d−1) ) be a d-
partition of rank n. The diagram of λ is the following set:
                        n                                        o
                   [λ] = (a, b, c) | 0 ≤ c ≤ d − 1, 1 ≤ b ≤ λ(c)
                                                             a     .

   The elements of this diagram are called the nodes of λ. Let γ = (a, b, c) be a
node of λ. The residue of γ associated to the set {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 } is the element of
Z/eZ defined by:
                          res(γ) = (b − a + vc )(mod e).
    Definition 4.1. We say that λ = (λ(0) , ..., λ(d−1) ) is a FLOTW d-partition
associated to the set {e; v0 , ..., vd−1 } if and only if:
     (1) for all 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 2 and i = 1, 2, ..., we have:
                                 (j)       (j+1)
                               λi      ≥ λi+vj+1 −vj ,
                                 (d−1)       (0)
                               λi        ≥ λi+e+v0 −vd−1 ;

     (2) for all k > 0, among the residues appearing at the right ends of the length
         k rows of λ, at least one element of {0, 1, ..., e − 1} does not occur.
We denote by Λ1{e;v0 ,...,vd−1 } the set of FLOTW d-partitions associated to the set
{e; v0 , ..., vd−1 }.
     Now, we are able to give the parametrizations of the canonical basic sets for all
Hecke algebras of finite Weyl group and for all specializations. Let H be a Hecke
algebra of a finite Weyl group W , let θ : A → k be a specialization into the field
of fractions k of θ(A) such that the characteristic of k is 0 or a good prime for W .
Let K be the field of fractions of A.

     4.2. Type An−1 . Assume that W is a Weyl group of type An−1 and that
θ(u) is a primitive eth -root of unity. Let λ be a partition of rank n, then, we
can construct an H-module S λ , free over A which is called a Specht module (see
the construction of “dual Specht modules” in [A, Chapter 13] in a more general
setting). Moreover, we have:
                                          λ
                             Irr(HK ) = {SK | λ ∈ Π1n }.
Now, Hecke algebras of type An−1 are special cases of Ariki-Koike algebras. Hence,
we can use the results in [J3] to find the canonical basic sets. We note that we
can also find this set using results of Dipper and James as it is expained in [G3,
Example 3.5]. Note also that there is no bad prime number for W = An−1 .
     Proposition 4.2. Assume that W is a Weyl group of type An−1 and that θ(u)
is a primitive eth -root of unity. Then, we have:
                                λ
                          B = {SK | λ ∈ Λ1 {e;0} , |λ| = n}.
Note that:
      λ ∈ Λ1{e;0}   ⇐⇒      λ = (λ1 , ..., λr ) is e − regular.
                    ⇐⇒      For all i ∈ N, we can’t have λi = ... = λi+e−1 6= 0.

    4.3. Type Bn . Assume that W is a Weyl group of type Bn and that θ(u) is a
primitive eth -root of unity. Let (λ(0) , λ(1) ) be a 2-partition of rank n, then, we can
                              (0) (1)
construct an H-module S (λ ,λ ) , free over A which is called a Specht module.
Moreover, we have:
                                                 (λ(0) ,λ(1) )
                       Irr(HK ) = {SK                             | (λ(0) , λ(1) ) ∈ Π2n }.
Now, Hecke algebras of type Bn are special cases of Ariki-Koike algebras. Hence,
we can use the results in [J3] to find the canonical basic sets. The only bad prime
for type Bn is p = 2.
     Proposition 4.3. Assume that W is a Weyl group of type Bn and that θ(u)
is a primitive eth -root of unity. Then, we have:
        • if e is odd:
                           (λ(0) ,λ(1) )
                B = {SK                    | λ(0) , λ(1) ∈ Λ1{e;0} , |λ(0) | + |λ(1) | = n}.
       • if e is even:
                       (0)
                              ,λ(1) )
               B = {S (λ                 | (λ(0) , λ(1) ) ∈ Λ1{e;1, e } , |λ(0) | + |λ(1) | = n}.
                                                                          2

                                 (0)     (1)
           Recall that (λ , λ ) ∈                Λ1{e;1, e }
                                               if and only if:
                                                         2
           (1) for all i = 1, 2, ..., we have:
                                                   (0)         (1)
                                                 λi      ≥ λi+ e −1 ,
                                                                   2
                                                   (1)         (0)
                                                 λi      ≥ λi+ e +1 ;
                                                                   2

           (2) for all k > 0, among the residues appearing at the right ends of the
               length k rows of (λ(0) , λ(1) ), at least one element of {0, 1, ..., e − 1}
               does not occur.
    4.4. Type Dn . Assume that W is a Weyl group of type Dn and that θ(u) is
a primitive eth -root of unity. Then, H can be seen as a subalgebra of an Hecke
algebra H1 of type Bn with the following diagram (see [G6]).
                                   1            u                u                          u
                                    t            t                t           ❵ ❵ ❵          t

    The specialization θ induces a decomposition map for H1 :
                                         d1θ : R0 (H1,K ) → R0 (H1,k ).
Similary to the equal parameter case, for all (λ(0) , λ(1) ) ∈ Π2n , we can construct an
               (0) (1)
H1 -module S (λ ,λ ) , free over A which is called a Specht module. We have:
                                                  (λ(0) ,λ(1) )
                      Irr(H1,K ) = {SK                            | (λ(0) , λ(1) ) ∈ Π2n }.
Now, we have an operation of restriction Res between the set of H1,K -modules and
the set of HK -modules. For (λ(0) , λ(1) ) ∈ Π2n , we have:
                                                          (λ(0) ,λ(1) )               (λ(1) ,λ(0) )
       • if λ(0) 6= λ(1) , we have Res(SK                                 ) ≃ Res(SK                  ) and the HK -
                           (0)     (1)(λ(0) ,λ(1) )
           module V [λ ,λ ] := Res(SK               ) is a                     simple HK -module.
                (0)     (1)                  (λ(0) ,λ(1) )                            (0)                (0)
       •   if λ      = λ , we have Res(SK                  )       = V [λ ,+] ⊕ V [λ                           ,−]
                                                                                                                     where
             [λ(0) ,+]      [λ(0) ,−]
           V         and V                     are non isomorphic simple HK -modules.

Moreover, we have:
                    n                               o[n                   o
          Irr(HK ) = V [λ,µ] | λ 6= µ, (λ, µ) ∈ Π2n     V [λ,±] | λ ∈ Π1n2 .
    Hecke algebras of type Bn with unequal parameters are special cases of Ariki-
Koike algebras. Hence, we can also define a canonical basic set for these algebras
(the existence has been previously proved in [G6]). Furthermore, in [G6], M.Geck
has shown that the simple HK -modules in the canonical basic set for type Dn are
those which appear in the restriction of the simple H1,K -modules of the canonical
basic set for type Dn . We obtain the following description of B. Note that the only
bad prime for type Dn is p = 2.
     Proposition 4.4. Assume that W is a Weyl group of type Dn and that θ(u)
is a primitive eth -root of unity. Then:
        • if e is odd, we have:
             n    (0) (1)
                                                                                    o
       B = V [λ ,λ ] | λ(0) 6= λ(1) , λ(0) , λ(1) ∈ Λ1{e;0} , |λ(0) | + |λ(1) | = n
                       S n [λ(0) ,±]                                o
                           V         | λ(0) ∈ Λ1{e;0} , 2|λ(0) | = n .
       • if e is even, we have:

                                                                                         o
     B = V [λ ,λ ] | λ(0) 6= λ(1) , (λ(0) , λ(1) ) ∈ Λ1{e;0, e } , |λ(0) | + |λ(1) | = n
                  S n [λ(0) ,±]                                   2          o
                      V         | (λ(0) , λ(0) ) ∈ Λ1{e;0, e } , 2|λ(0) | = n .
                                                               2

                          (0)   (1)
          Recall that (λ , λ ) ∈      Λ1{e;0, e }
                                              if and only if:
                                              2
          (1) for all i = 1, 2, ..., we have:
                                         (0)         (1)
                                        λi     ≥ λi+ e ,
                                                           2
                                         (1)         (0)

           (2) for all k > 0, among the residues appearing at the right ends of the
               length k rows of (λ(0) , λ(1) ), at least one element of {0, 1, ..., e − 1}
               does not occur.
     4.5. Exceptional types. The decomposition matrices are explicitely known
for type G2 , F4 , E6 and E7 (see [Mu], [G1], [G2] and [GL]) for all specializations
in characteristic 0. Hence, in this case, it suffices to study these matrices and to
use Theorem 2.1 to obtain the canonical basic in characteristic 0. Next, Theorem
3.3 gives the canonical basic sets in “good” positive characteristic.
     For type E8 , Müller has given in [Mu] a set of projective HO -modules which
is in bijection with the set of projective indecomposable HO -modules (which corre-
sponds to the columns of the decomposition matrices, see [GP, Section 7.5]). It is
easy to obtain the canonical basic set by studying these projective HO -modules.
     An explicit description of the canonical basic set for all exceptional types and
for all specializations can be found in [J2, Chapter 3].
