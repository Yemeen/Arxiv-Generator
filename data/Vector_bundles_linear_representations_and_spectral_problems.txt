                                                   classical problems of linear algebra and representation theory, based on new approach,
                                                   originated from geometry of stable bundles and geometric invariant theory.

                                             1. Introduction
                                                  Theory of vector bundles brings a new meaning and adds a delicate geometric
                                             flavour to classical spectral problems of linear algebra, relating them to geometric
                                             invariant theory, representation theory, Schubert calculus, quantum cohomology,
                                             and various moduli spaces. The talk may be considered as a supplement to that of
                                             Hermann Weyl [35] from which I borrow the following quotation
                                                  “In preparing this lecture, the speaker has assumed that he is expected to talk
                                             on a subject in which he had some first-hand experience through his own work. And
                                             glancing back over the years he found that the one topic to which he has returned
                                             again and again is the problem of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in its various
                                             ramifications.”

                                             2. Spectra and representations
                                                  Let’s start with two classical and apparently independent problems.
                                                  Hermitian spectral problem. Find all possible spectra λ(A + B) of sum
                                             of Hermitian operators A, B with given spectra

                                                                       λ(A) : λ1 (A) ≥ λ2 (A) ≥ · · · ≥ λn (A),
                                                                       λ(B) : λ1 (B) ≥ λ2 (B) ≥ · · · ≥ λn (B).

       Among commonly known restrictions on spectra are trace identity
                         X                   X                    X
                              λi (A + B) =             λj (A) +       λk (B)
                          i                    j                  k


and a number of classical inequalities, like that of Weyl [34]

                              λi+j−1 (A + B) ≤ λi (A) + λj (B).                      (2.0)

     Tensor product problem. Find all components Vγ ⊂ Vα ⊗ Vβ of tensor
product of two irreducible representations of GLn with highest weights (=Young
diagrams)
                              α : a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an
                                   β : b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bn .

    In contrast to the spectral problem (2.1) the coefficients of tensor product
decomposition
                                       X γ
                             Vα ⊗ Vβ =     cαβ Vγ                           (2.1)
                                                       γ

can be evaluated algorithmically by Littlewood–Richardson rule, which may be de-
scribed as follows. Fill i-th row of diagram β by symbol i. Then cγαβ is equal to
number of ways to produce diagram γ by adding cells from β to α in such a way
that the symbols
        i) weakly increase in rows,
       ii) strictly increase in columns,
      iii) reading all the symbols from right to left, and from top to bottom produces
           a lattice permutation, i.e. in every initial interval symbol i appears at least
           as many times as i + 1.
     It turns out that these two problems are essentially equivalent and have the
same answer. To give it, let’s associate with a subset I ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n} of cardinality
p = |I| Young diagram σI in a rectangular of format p × q, p + q = n, cut out by
polygonal line ΓI , connecting SW and N E corners of the rectangular, with i-th
unit edge running to the North, for i ∈ I, and to the East otherwise. One can
formally multiply the diagrams by L-R rule
                                               X
                                     σI σJ =            cK
                                                         IJ σK                       (2.2)
                                                   k

       K
where σIJ  := cσσK
                 I σJ
                      are L-R coefficients. Geometrically (2.2) is decomposition of
product of two Schubert cycles in cohomology ring of Grassmannian Gqp of linear
subspaces of dimension p and codimension q.

Theorem 2.1. The following conditions are equivalent
    i) There exist Hermitian operators A, B, C = A + B with spectra λ(A), λ(B),
λ(C).
    ii) Inequality
                           λK (C) ≤ λI (A) + λJ (B),                      (IJK)

holds each time L-R coefficient cK
                                 IJ 6= 0. Here I, J, K ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n} are subsets of
                                          P
the same cardinality p < n, and λI (A) = i∈I λi (A).
     iii) For integer spectra α = λ(A), β = λ(B), γ = λ(C) the above conditions
are equivalent to
                                   Vγ ⊂ Vα ⊗ Vβ .                                   (2.3)

Remarks 2.2. (1) The last claim iii) implies a recurrence procedure to generate
all α, β, γ with cγαβ 6= 0:

         cγαβ 6= 0 ⇐⇒ Vγ ⊂ Vα ⊗ Vβ ⇐⇒ γK ≤ αI + βJ each time cK
                                                              IJ 6= 0.
                   LR                  Th


Here cγαβ are Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for group GLn , while cK
                                                                        IJ are L-R
coefficient for group GLp of smaller rank p < n. An explicit form of this recur-
rence has been conjectured by A. Horn [13] in the framework of Hermitian spectral
problem.
      (2) Inequalities (IJK) for cK
                                  IJ 6= 0 define a cone in the space of triplets of
spectra, and the facets of this cone correspond to cK
                                                    IJ = 1. P. Belkale [3] was first
to note that all inequalities (IJK) follows from those with cK
                                                             IJ = 1, and in recent
preprint A. Knutson, T. Tao, and Ch. Woodward [23] proved their independence.
In my original paper [19] condition (2.3) appears in a weaker form

                        VN γ ⊂ VN α ⊗ VN β    for some N > 0,                      (2.3′ )

and its equivalence to (2.3), known as saturation conjecture, was later proved by
A. Knutson and T. Tao [22], and in more general quiver context by H. Derksen and
J. Weyman [6].
      Note that inequalities (IJK), although complete, are too numerous to be prac-
tical for large n. That is why L-R rule, in its different incarnations [22, 11], often
provides a more intuitive way to see possible spectra for sum of Hermitian operators.
Example 2.3. Let A be Hermitian matrix with integer spectrum λ(A) : a1 ≥
a2 ≥ . . . ≥ an and B ≥ 0 be a nonnegative matrix of rank one with spectrum
λ(B) : b ≥ 0 ≥ · · · ≥ 0. Viewing the spectra as Young diagrams, and applying L-R
rule we find out that λ(A) ⊗ λ(B) is a sum of diagrams γ : c1 ≥ c2 ≥ · · · ≥ cn
satisfying the following intrlacing inequalities

                           c1 ≥ a1 ≥ c2 ≥ a2 · · · ≥ cn ≥ an .
602                                     A. Klyachko

By Theorem 2.3 this implies Cauchy interlacing theorem for spectra

                λi (A) ≤ λi (A + B) ≤ λi−1 (A),       rkB = 1,   B ≥ 0,

known in mechanics as Rayleigh-Courant-Fisher principle: Let mechanical system
S ′ is obtained from another one S, by imposing a linear constraint, e.g. by fixing a
point of a drum. Then spectrum of S separates spectrum of S ′ .

3. Toric bundles
      Historically Theorem 2.3 first appears as a byproduct of theory of toric vector
bundles and sheaves, originated in [15, 17]. See other expositions of the theory in
[21, 30], and further applications in [16, 33]. Vector bundles form a cross point at
which the diverse subjects of this paper meet together.

3.1. Filtrations
      To avoid technicalities let’s consider the simplest case of projective plane

                             P2 = {(xα : xβ : xγ )|x ∈ C}

on which diagonal torus

                              T = {(tα : tβ : tγ )|t ∈ C∗ }                       (3.1)

acts by the formula
                             t · x = (tα xα : tβ xβ : tγ xγ ).
Orbits of this action are vertices, sides and complement of the coordinate triangle. In
particular there is unique dense orbit, consisting of points with nonzero coordinates.
      The objects of our interest are T -equivariant (or toric for short) vector bundles
E over P2 . This means that E is endowed with an action T : E which is linear on
fibers and makes the following diagram commutative

                              E@ > t >> E
                            @V πV V @V V πV             t ∈ T.

                             P2 @ > t >> P2

Let us fix a generic point p0 ∈ P2 not in a coordinate line, and denote by

                                      E := E(p0 )

the corresponding generic fiber. There is no action of torus T on the fiber E.
Instead the equivariant structure produces some distinguished subspaces in E by
the following construction. Let us choose a generic point pα ∈ X α in coordinate
line X α : xα = 0. Since T -orbit of p0 is dense in P2 , we can vary t ∈ T so that tp0
                                Spectral Problems                                    603

tends to pα . Then for any vector e ∈ E = E(p0 ), we have te ∈ E(tp0 ) and can try
the limit
                                     lim (te)
                                       tp0 →pα

which either exists or not. Let us denote by E α (0) the set of vectors e ∈ E for
which the limit exists:
                        E α (0) := {e ∈ E| lim (te) exists}.
                                            tp0 →pα
             α
Evidently E (0) is a vector subspace of E, independent of p0 and pα .
     An easy modification of the previous construction allows to define for integer
m ∈ Z, the subspace
                          (                −m                )
                 α                         tα
               E (m) := e ∈ E| lim                · (te) exists .
                                  tp0 →pα  tβ
Roughly speaking E α (m) consists of vectors e ∈ E for which te vanishes up to order
m as tp0 tends to coordinate line X α . The subspaces E α (m) form a non-increasing
exhaustive Z-filtration:
                E α : · · · ⊃ E α (m − 1) ⊃ E α (m) ⊃ E α (m + 1) ⊃ · · · ,
                                E α (m) = 0, for m ≫ 0,                            (3.2)
                                E α (m) = E, for m ≪ 0.
Applying this construction to other coordinate lines, we get a triple of filtrations
E α , E β , E γ in generic fiber E = E(p0 ), associated with toric bundle E.
 Theorem 3.1. The correspondence
                                  E 7→ (E α , E β , E γ )                          (3.3)
establishes an equivalence between category of toric vector bundles on P2 and cate-
gory of triply filtered vector spaces.
      We’ll use notation E(E α , E β , E γ ) for toric bundle corresponding to triplet of
filtrations E α , E β , E γ .

3.2. Stability
      The previous theorem tells that every property or invariant of a vector bundle
has its counterpart on the level of filtrations. For application to spectral problems
the notion of stability of a vector bundle E is crucial. Recall that E → P2 is said to
be Mumford–Takemoto stable iff
                                    c1 (F )   c1 (E)
                                            <                                    (3.4)
                                     rk F      rk E
for every proper subsheaf F ⊂ E, and semistable if weak inequalities hold. Here
c1 (E) = deg det E is the first Chern class. Donaldson theorem [7] brings a deep
geometrical meaning to this seemingly artificial definition: Every stable bundle
carries unique Hermit-Einstein metric (with Ricci curvature proportional to metric).
604                                    A. Klyachko

Theorem 3.2. Toric bundle E = E(E α , E β , E γ ) is stable iff for every proper sub-
space F ⊂ E the following inequality holds
               1      X                        1    X
                           i dim F [ν] (i) <              i dim E [ν] (i)       (3.5)
             dim F                           dim E
                     ν=α,β,γ                            ν=α,β,γ
                       i∈Z                                i∈Z

where F ν (i) = F ∩ E ν (i) is induces filtration with composition factors F [ν] (i) =
F ν (i)/F ν (i + 1).
    There is nothing surprising in this theorem since the sums in (3.5) are just
Chern classes of the corresponding toric bundles and sheaves.
Remark 3.3. Inequality (3.5) depends only on relative positions of subspace F ⊂
E with respect to filtrations E α , E β , E γ , which are given by three Schubert cells
sα , sβ , sγ . Hence we have one inequality each time.
                                   sα ∩ sβ ∩ sγ 6= ∅.                             (3.6)
For filtrations in general position (3.6) is equivalent to nonvanishing of the product
of Schubert cycles σα · σβ · σγ 6= 0 in cohomolgy ring of Grassmannian, and in this
case stability inequalities (3.5) amount to inequalities (IJK) of Theorem 2.1.

3.3. Back to Hermitian operators
      Let now E be Hermitian space and H : E → E be Hermitian operator with
spectral filtration                                      
                               sum of eigenspaces of H
                    E H (x) =                               .          (3.7)
                               with eigenvalues at least x
The operator can be recovered from the filtration using spectral decomposition
                                   Z ∞
                               H=        xdPH (x)
                                        −∞

where PH (x) is orthogonal projector with kernel E H (x). So in Hermitian space we
have equivalence
                       Hermitian operators = R-filtrations.
Let H α be Hermitian operator with spectral filtration E α . Its spectrum depends
only on filtration E α , and we define Spec E α := Spec H α .
Theorem 3.3. Indecomposable triplet of R-filtrations E α , E β , E γ is stable iff there
exists a Hermitian metric in E such that the sum of the corresponding Hermitian
operators is a scalar
                            H α + H β + H γ = scalar.                              (3.8)

     This is a toric version of Donaldson theorem on existence of Hermit–Einstein
metric in stable bundles. Together with Theorem 3.2 it reduces solution of Hermit-
ian spectral problem to stability inequalities (3.5), which by remark 3.3 amounts to
inequalities (IJK) of Theorem 2.1.
     See also Faltings talk [9] on arithmetical applications of stable filtrations.

3.4. Components of tensor product
       In the previous section we explain that stability inequalities (3.5) (⇔ (IJK))
via toric Donaldson-Yau theorem solve Hermitian spectral problem. To relate this
with tensor product part of Theorem 2.1 we need another interpretation of the
stability inequalities via Geometric Invariant Theory [26].
       Recall, that point x ∈ P(V ) is said to be GIT stable with respect to linear
action G : V if G-orbit of the corresponding vector x ∈ V is closed and its stabilizer
is finite. Let
                                 X = Fα × Fβ × Fγ
be product of three flag varieties of the same types as flags of the filtrations
E α , E β , E γ , and Lα be line bundle on the flag variety F α induced by character
                      ωα : diag(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) 7→ xa1 1 xa1 2 · · · xa1 n ,
where α : a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an is the spectrum of filtration E α , i.e. spectrum of the
corresponding operator H α .
Observation 3.4. Vector bundle E = E(E α , E β , E γ ) is stable iff the corresponding
triplet of flags
              x = F α × F β × F γ ∈ F α × F β × F γ = X ֒→ P(Γ(X, L))
is a GIT stable point w.r. to group SL(E) and polarization L = Lα ⊠ Lβ ⊠ Lγ .
      This observation is essentially due to Mumford [25]. Notice that by Borel-Weil-
Bott theorem [5] the space of global sections Γ(F α , Lα ) = Vα is just an irreducible
representation of SL(E) with highest weight α. Hence Γ(X, L)) = Vα ⊗ Vβ ⊗ Vγ .
Every stable vector x can be separated from zero by a G-invariant section of LN .
Therefore triplet of flags in generic position is stable iff [VN α ⊗ VN β ⊗ VN γ ]SL(E) 6= 0
for some N ≥ 1. This proves the last part of Theorem 2.1, modulo the saturation
conjecture.

4. Unitary operators and parabolic bundles
     We have seen in the previous section that solution of the Hermitian spectral
problem amounts to stability condition for toric bundles. A remarkable ramification
of this idea was discovered by S. Angihotri and Ch. Woodward [2] for unitary
spectral problem.
     Let U ∈ SU(n) be unitary matrix with unitary spectrum
                           ε(U ) = (e2πiλ1 , e2πiλ2 , . . . , e2πiλn ).
Let’s normalize exponents λi as follows
                                
                                  λ ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn ,
                                 1
                       λ(U ) := λ1 + λ2 + · · · + λn = 0,                             (4.1)
                                
                                
                                   λ1 − λn < 1,
and, admitting an abuse of language, call λ(U ) spectrum of U .

Unitary spectral problem. Find possible spectra of product λ(U V ), when spec-
tra of the factors λ(U ), λ(V ) are given.
     To state the result we need in quantum cohomology H∗q (Grp ) of Grassmannian
Grpof linear subspaces of dimension p and codimension r. This is an algebra over
polynomial ring C[q] generated by Schubert cycles σI , I ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n}, |I| = p,
n = p + r with multiplication given by the formula
                                             X
                                 σI ∗ σJ =         cK      d
                                                    IJ (d)q σK
                                             K,d

                                                                      Vp n
where structure constants cK                                   p
                           IJ (d) are defined as follows. Let Gq ֒→ P(  C ) be
Plücker imbedding and
                                   ϕ : P1 → Grp
                                                          Vp
be a rational curve of degree d in Gressmanian Gpq ⊂ P( Cn ). One can check
that ϕ depends on dim Gpq + nd parameters. For fixed point x ∈ P1 the condition
ϕ(x) ∈ σI imposes codim σI constraints on ϕ. Hence for

                     codim σI + codim σJ + codim σK = dim Grp + nd

the numbers

      (σI , σJ , σK )d = #{ϕ : P1 → Grp | ϕ(x) ∈ σI , ϕ(x) ∈ σJ , ϕ(x) ∈ σK , deg ϕ = d}

supposed to be finite. They are known as Gromov -Witten invariants and related
to the structure constants by the formula

                                  cK
                                   IJ (d) = (σI , σJ , σK ∗ )d


where K ∗ = {n + 1 − k | k ∈ K}. For d = 0 they are just conventional Littlewood–
Richardson coefficients cK
                         IJ .

Theorem 4.1. The following conditions are equivalent
    i) There exist unitary matrices W = U V with given spectra λ(U ), λ(V ), λ(W ).
    ii) The inequality
                    λI (U ) + λJ (V ) ≤ d + λK (W )                         (IJK)d
    holds each time cK IJ (d) 6
                              = 0.

4.1. Parabolic bundles
     As in the Hermitian case solution of the unitary problem comes from its holo-
morphic interpretation in terms of vector bundles. To explain the idea let’s start
with vector bundle E over compact Riemann surface X of genus g ≥ 2. It has unique
topological invariant c1 (E) = deg det E, which for simplicity we suppose to be zero,
                                  Spectral Problems                                   607

i.e. E be topologically trivial. Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem [27] claims that ev-
ery stable bundle carries unique flat metric, and hence defines unitary monodromy
representation
                       ρE : π1 (X, x0 ) → SU(E), E = E(x0 ).
This gives rise to equivalence
                                                                
                      stable bundles    irreducible uitary represen-
            Mg :=                     =                              .               (4.2)
                      of degree zero    tations ρ : π1 → SU(E)

This theorem is an ancestor of the Donaldson-Yau generalization [7] to higher di-
mensions, and may be seen as a geometric version of Langlands correspondence.
     In algebraic terms the theorem describes stable bundles in terms of solution
of equation
                          [U1 , V1 ][U2 , V2 ] · · · [Ug , Vg ] = 1
in unitary matrices Ui , Vj ∈ SU(E). This is not the matrix problem we are
currently interested in. To modify it let’s consider punctured Riemann surface
X = X\{p1 , p2 , . . . , pℓ }. It has distinguished classes

                             γα = (small circle around pα )

in fundamental group π1 (X), and we can readily define an analogue of RHS of (4.2):

      Mg (λ(1) , λ(2) , · · · , λ(ℓ) ) = {ρ : π1 (X) → SU(E) | λ(ρ(γα )) = λ(α) },   (4.3)

where λ(α) is a given spectrum of monodromy around puncture pα . C. S. Seshadri
[31] manages to find an analogue of more subtle holomorphic LHS of (4.2) in terms
of so called parabolic bundles.
      Parabolic bundle E on X is actually a bundle on compactification X together
with R-filtration in every special fiber E α = E(pα ) with support in an interval of
length ≤ 1. The filtration is a substitution for spectral decomposition of ρ(γα ), cf.
(4.1). Seshadri also defines (semi)stability of parabolic bundle E by inequalities

                           Par deg F   Par deg E
                                     ≤           ,       ∀F ⊂ E,                     (4.4)
                             rk F        rk E
                                                                        P     (α)
where the parabolic degree is given by equation Par deg E = deg E + α,i λi .
Metha-Seshadri theorem [24] claims that every stable parabolic bundle E on X
carries unique flat metric with given spectra of monodromies λ(γα ) = λ(α) . This
gives a holomorphic interpretation of the space (4.3)
                                                                      
          (1)  (2)       (ℓ)    stable parabolic bundles of degree zero
    Mg (λ , λ , · · · , λ ) =                                            .   (4.5)
                                with given types of the filtrations

In the simplest case of projective line with three punctures (4.3) amounts to space
of solutions of equation U V W = 1 in unitary matrices U, V, W ∈ SU(n) with given
608                                    A. Klyachko

spectra. By Metha-Seshadry theorem solvability of this equation is equivalent to
stability inequalities (4.4). In the case under consideration holomorphic vector
bundle E on P1 is trivial, E = E × P1 , and hence its subbundle F ⊂ E of rank p
is nothing but a rational curve ϕ : P1 → Gp (E) in Grassmannian. This allows to
write down stability condition (4.4) in terms of quantum cohomology, and eventually
arrive at Theorem 4.1.

5. Further ramifications
     The progress in Hermitian and unitary spectral problems open way for solu-
tion of a variety of others classical, and not so classical, problems. Most of them,
however, have no holomorphic interpretation, and require different methods, bor-
rowed from harmonic analysis on homogeneous spaces, symplectic geometry, and
geometric invariant theory.

5.1. Multiplicative singular value problem
      The problem in question is about possible singular spectrum σ(AB) of product
of complex matrices with given singular spectra σ(A) and σ(B). Recall, that   √singu-
lar spectrum of complex matrix A is spectrum of its radial part σ(A) := λ( A∗ A).
      For a long time it was observed that every inequality for Hermitian problem has
a multiplicative counterpart for the singular one. For example multiplicative version
of Weyl’s inequality λi+j−1 (A + B) ≤ λi (A) + λj (B) is σi+j−1 (AB) ≤ σi (A)σj (B).
The equivalence between these two problems was conjectured by R. C. Thompson,
and first proved by the author [20] using harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces.
Later on A. Alekseev, E. Menreken, and Ch. Woodward [1] gave an elegant concep-
tual solution based on Drinfeld’s Poisson-Lie groups [8]. Here is a precise statement
for classical groups.

Theorem 5.1. Let G be one of the classical groups SL(n, C), SO(n, C), or Sp(2n, C)
and L be the corresponding compact Lie algebra of traceless skew Hermitian com-
plex, real, or quaternionic n×n matrices respectively. Then the following conditions
are equivalent
      (1) There exist Ai ∈ G with given singular spectra σ(Ai ) = σi and

                                   A1 A2 · · · AN = 1.
                                                     √
      (2) There exist Hi ∈ L with spectra λ(Hi ) =    −1 log σi and

                               H1 + H2 + · · · + HN = 0.


      Note, however, that neither of the above approaches solve the singular problem
per se, but reduces it to Hermitian one. Both of them suggest that all three problems
                                     Spectral Problems                           609

must be treated in one package. More precisely, every compact simply connected
group G give birth to three symmetric spaces
     • The group G itself,
     • Its Lie algebra LG ,
     • The dual symmetric space HG = GC /G,
of positive, zero, and negative curvature, and to three “spectral problems” concerned
with support of convolution of G orbits in these spaces, see [20] for details. For
G = SU(n) we return to the package of unitary, Hermitian, and singular problems.
     The first two problems may be effectively treated in framework of vector bun-
dles with structure group G, as explained in sections 2–4. Many flat, i.e. additive
“spectral problem” has been solved by A. Berenstein and R. Sjammar in a very
general setting [4].

5.2. Other symmetric spaces
     As an example of unresolved problem let’s consider symmetric spaces associ-
ated with different incarnations of Grassmannian
     • Compact U (p + q)/U (p) × U (q),
     • Flat Mat(p, q) = coomplex p × q matrices,
     • Hyperbolic U (p, q)/U (p) × U (q).
In compact case the corresponding spectral problem is about possible angles between
three p-subspaces U, V, W ⊂ Hn in Hermitian space Hn of dimension n = p + q,
p ≤ q. The Jordan angles

                          d                                       π
                          U V = (ϕ1 , ϕ2 , . . . , ϕp ),   0≤ϕ≤
                                                                  2
between subspaces U, V are defined via spectrum of product of orthogonal projectors
πUV : U → V and πV U : V → U
                      √
                    λ( πUV πV U ) : cos ϕ1 ≥ cos ϕ2 ≥ · · · ≥ cos ϕp ≥ 0.

Yu. Neretin [28] proved Lidskii type inequalities1 for angles U    dV , Vd d
                                                                         W,W U , and
conjectured that other inequalities are the same as in the Hermitian case. Note,
however, that the unitary triplet suggests existence of nonhomogeneous “quantum”
inequalities, e.g. sum of angles of a spherical triangle is ≤ π.
     In flat case the problem is about relation between singular spectra of p × q
matrices σ(A−B), σ(B −C), σ(C −A). This additive singular problem was resolved
by O’Shea and Sjamaar [29].
     In hyperbolic case the question is about angles between maximal positive sub-
spaces U, V, W ⊂ Hpq in Hermitian space of signature (p, q). They are defined by
equation
                  √
                λ( πUV πV U ) : cosh ϕ1 ≥ cosh ϕ2 ≥ · · · ≥ cosh ϕp ≥ 1.
     1 He   actually deals with real Grassamnnian.
610                                             A. Klyachko

Again our experience with the unitary triplet suggests that the exponential map
establishes a Thompson’s type correspondence between O’Shea-Sjamaar inequalities
for additive singular problem and that of for hyperbolic angles.

5.3. P-adic spectral problems
      There is also a nonarchimedian counterpart of this theory, which deals with
classical Chevalley groups Gp = SL(n, Qp ), SO(n, Qp ), or Sp(2n, Qp ) over p-adic
field Qp and their maximal compact subgroups Kp = SL(n, Zp ), SO(n, Zp ), or
Sp(2n, Zp ) respectively. Double coset Kp gKp may be treated as a complete invariant
of lattice L = gL0 , L0 = Zp⊕n with respect to Kp . We call lattice L = gL0
unimodular, orthogonal or symplectic if respectively g ∈ SL(n, Qp ), g ∈ SO(n, Qp )
or g ∈ Sp(2n, Qp ).
      It is commonly known that in the unimodular case there exists a basis ei of
L0 such that ẽi = pai ei form a basis of L for some ai ∈ Z. We define index (L : L0 )
by
               (L : L0 ) = (pa1 , pa2 , . . . , pan ), a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an .   (5.1)
Notice that unimodularity g ∈ SL(n, Qp ) implies a1 + a2 + · · · + an = 0.
      The index (L : L0 ) of an orthogonal or a symplectic lattices has extra symme-
tries. In orthogonal case we may choose the above basis ei of L0 to be neutral, in
which case the quadratic form becomes
                               n−1
                               X
                                     xi x−i ,    i≡n−1         mod 2.
                               1−n
Then the index takes the form
                        (L : L0 ) = (pan−1 , pan−3 , . . . , pa3−n , pa1−n ),              (5.2)
where an−1 ≥ an−3 ≥ . . . ≥ a3−n ≥ a1−n , and a−i = −ai .
     Similarly, for symplectic lattice L we can choose symplectic basis ei , fj of L0
such that ẽi = pai ei and f˜j = p−aj fj form a basis of L. In this case we have
                (L : L0 ) = (pan , pan−1 , . . . , pa1 , p−a1 , . . . , p−an−1 , p−an ),   (5.3)
with an ≥ an−1 ≥, . . . , ≥ a1 ≥ 0.
     Notice that the spectra (5.1)-(5.3) have the same symmetry, as singular spec-
trum σ(A) of a matrix A ∈ G in the corresponding classical complex group.
Theorem 5.2. The following conditions are equivalent
  (1) There exists a sequence of (unimodular, orthogonal, symplectic) lattices
                                  L0 , L1 , . . . , LN −1 , LN = L0
          of given indices σi = (Li : Li−1 ).
      (2) The indices σi satisfy the equivalent conditions of Theorem 5.1 for the cor-
          responding complex group G.
      We’ll give proof elsewhere. The theorem is known for the unimodular lattices,
see [10].

5.4. Final remarks
     In the talk I try to trace the flaw of ideas from the theory of vector bundles
to spectral problems. It seems C. Simpson [32] was the first to note that vector
bundles technic has nontrivial implications in linear algebra. He proved that product
C1 C2 · · · CN of conjugacy classes Ci ⊂ SL(n, C) is dense in SL(n, C) iff

                 dim C1 + dim C2 + · · · + dim CN ≥ (n + 1)(n − 2),
                                                                                 (5.4)
                                r1 + r2 + · · · + rN ≥ n,

where ri is maximal codimension of root space of a matrix Ai ∈ Ci . This problem
was suggested by P. Deligne, who noted that under condition

                    dim C1 + dim C2 + · · · + dim CN = 2n2 − 2

an irreducible solution of equation A1 A2 · · · AN = 1, ai ∈ Ci is unique up to conju-
gacy, see book of N. Katz [14] on this rigidity phenomenon.
      I think that inverse applications to moduli spaces of vector bundles are sill
ahead. One may consider polygon spaces [18, 12] as a toy example of this feedback,
corresponding to toric 2-bundles. A similar space of spherical polygons in S3 with
given sides is a model for moduli space of flat connections in punctured Riemann
sphere. Its description is a challenge problem.
      There are many interesting results, e.g. infinite dimensional spectral problems,
which fall out of this survey. I refer to Fulton’s paper [10] for missing details.
