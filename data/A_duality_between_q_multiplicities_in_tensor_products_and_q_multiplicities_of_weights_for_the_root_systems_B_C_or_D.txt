                                                   M (µ) is a tensor product of row or column shaped modules defined by µ. We prove that these

                                                   D. Finally we derive formulas expressing the associated multiplicities in terms of Kostka numbers.

                                             Schur duality is a classical result in representation theory establishing that Kλ,µ   is also equal to the
                                             multiplicity of V (λ) in the tensor products

                                             nantal expression of the Schur function sµ = char(V (µ)) in terms of the characters hk = char(V (kΛ1 ))
                                             of the k-th symmetric power representation. This formula can be rewritten
                                                                                                  Y

                                             makes sense to write                         Y

There exists a q-analogue Kλ,µ   (q) of Kλ,µ obtained by replacing the ordinary Kostant’s partition
function P A m                     A

which is a polynomial in q with nonnegative integer coefficients [8], [9]. In [11], Nakayashiki and Ya-
                         Am
mada have shown that Kλ,µ   (q) can also be computed from the combinatorial R matrix corresponding
                                               d
to Kashiwara’s crystals associated to some Uq (slm )-modules.
                                                                                                        g
    For g = so2m+1 , sp2m or so2m there also exist expressions similar to (3) for the multiplicities Kλ,µ
of the weight µ in the finite dimensional irreducible module V (λ) but a so simple duality as for slm
does not exist although it is possible to obtain certain duality results between multiplicities of weights
and tensor product multiplicities of representations by using duals pairs of algebraic groups (see [5]).
This implies that the quantifications of weight multiplicities and tensor product multiplicities can
                                                                                            g
not coincide for the root systems Bm , Cm and Dm . The Kostka-Foulkes polynomials Kλ,µ         (q) are the
                  g
q-analogues of Kλ,µ defined as in (4) by quantifying the partition function corresponding to the root
system associated to g (see 2.2). In [13], Hatayama, Kuniba, Okado and Takagi have introduced for
                             Cm
type Cm a quantification Xλ,µ   (q) of the multiplicity of V (λ) in the tensor product

                                            W (µ1 Λ1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ W (µm Λ1 )

where for any i = 1, ..., m,

                      W (µi Λ1 ) = V (µi Λ1 ) ⊕ V ((µi − 2)Λ1 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ V ((µi mod2)Λ1 ).

This quantification is based on the determination of the combinatorial R matrix of some Uq′ (g)-crystals
in the spirit of [11]. Note that there also exit q-multiplicities for the sp2 -module V (λ) in a tensor
product
                                          V (Λ1 )⊗k ⊗ V (Λ2 )⊗l
where k, l are positive integers obtained by Yamada [17].
   In this paper we first use Jacobi-Trudi’s type determinantal expressions for the Schur functions
associated to g to introduce q-analogues of the multiplicity of V (λ) in the tensor products

          (i) : h(µ) = V (µ1 Λ1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ V (µm Λ1 ), H(µ) = W (µ1 Λ1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ W (µm Λ1 )
          (ii) : e(µ) = V (Λµ′1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ V (Λµ′n ), E(µ) = W (Λµ′1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ W (Λµ′n ) with m ≥ |µ|

where             
                      W (µi Λ1 ) = V (µi Λ1 ) ⊕ V ((µi − 2)Λ1 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ V ((µi mod2)Λ1 )
                                                                                              .
                             W (Λk ) = V (Λk ) ⊕ V (Λk−2 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ V (Λk mod 2 )
With the condition m ≥ |µ| for (ii), these multiplicities are independent of the root system considered.
When q = 1, we recover a remarkable property already used by Koike and Terada in [6]. Next we
prove that these q-multiplicities are in fact equal to Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated to the root

                                                           2
systems of types C and D. It is possible to extend the definition (4) of the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials
associated to the root system Am by replacing µ by γ ∈ Nm where γ is not a partition. In this case
  Am                                                Am
Kλ,γ  (q) may have nonnegative coefficients but Kλ,γ   (1) is equal to the dimension of the weight space
        A
γ in V (λ). We obtained simple expressions of the q-multiplicities defined above in terms of the
          m
                Am
polynomials Kλ,γ   (q). By specializing at q = 1 we derive formulas to compute the related multiplicities
from the Kostka numbers.
    In section 1 we recall background on the root systems Bm , Cm and Dm and the corresponding
Kostka-Foulkes polynomials. We review in section 2 the determinantal identities for Schur functions
that we need in the sequel and we introduce the formalism suggested in [1] to prove the expressions
of Schur functions in terms of raising and lowering operators implicitly contain in [15]. Thank to
this formalism we are able to obtain expressions for multiplicities similar to (3). We quantify these
multiplicities to obtain the desired q-analogues in section 3. We prove in Section 4 two duality theo-
rems between our q-analogues and certain Kostka-Foulkes polynomials of types C and D. Finally we
establish formulas expressing the associated multiplicities in terms of Kostka numbers.

Notation: In the sequel we frequently define similar objects for the root systems Bn Cn and Dn .
When they are related to type Bn (resp. Cn , Dn ), we implicitly attach to them the label B (resp. the
labels C, D). To avoid cumbersome repetitions, we sometimes omit the labels B, C and D when our
definitions or statements are identical for the three root systems.

Note: While writing this work, I have been informed that Shimozono and Zabrocki [16] have introduced
independently and by using creating operators essentially the same tensor power multiplicities. Thanks
to this formalism they recover in particular Jacobi-Trudi’s type determinantal expressions of the Schur
functions associated to the root systems B, C and D which constitute the starting point of this article.


2     Background on the root systems Bm , Cm and Dm
2.1   Convention for the positive roots
Consider an integer m ≥ 1. The weight lattice for         themroot system Cm (resp. Bm and Dm ) can

be identified with PCm = Zm (resp. PBm = PDm                     ) equipped with the orthonormal basis εi ,
                                                            2
i = 1, ..., m. We take for the simple roots
           Bm                B
           αm = εm and αi m = εi − εi+1 , i = 1, ..., m − 1 for the root system Bm
             α m = 2εm and αC
               C                 m
                                   = εi − εi+1 , i = 1, ..., m − 1 for the root system Cm        .    (5)
           m  D
                               i
                                      Dm
             αm = εm + εm−1 and αi = εi − εi+1 , i = 1, ..., m − 1 for the root system Dm
                 m



Then the set of positive roots are
  +
  RBm = {εi − εj , εi + εj with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m} ∪ {εi with 1 ≤ i ≤ m} for the root system Bm
    R+m = {εi − εj , εi + εj with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m} ∪ {2εi with 1 ≤ i ≤ m} for the root system Cm .
  C  +
    RD  m
          = {εi − εj , εi + εj with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m} for the root system Dm

Denote respectively by PB+m , PC+m and PD+m the sets of dominant weights of so2m+1 , sp2m and so2m .
Let λ =P(λ1 , ..., λm ) be a partition with m parts. We will classically identify λ with the dominant
weight m i=1 λi εi . Note that there exists dominant weights associated to the orthogonal root systems


                                                    3
whose coordinates on the basis εi , i = 1, ..., m are not positive integers (hence which can not be related
to a partition). For each root system of type Bm , Cm or Dm , the set of weights having nonnegative
                                                                            + of partitions of length m. For
integer coordinates on the basis ε1 , ..., εm can be identify with the set πm
any partition λ, the weights of the finite dimensional so2m+1 , sp2m or so2m -module of highest weight
λ are all in πm = Zm . For any α ∈ πm we write |α| = α1 + · · ·αm .
The conjugate partition of the partition λ is denoted λ′ as usual. Consider λ, µ two partitions of length
m and set n = max(λ1 , µ1 ). Then by adding to λ′ and µ′ the required numbers of parts 0 we will
consider them as partitions of length n.

The Weyl group WBm = WCm of so2m+1 and sp2m can be regarded as the sub-group of the permutation
group of {m, ..., 2, 1, 1, 2, ..., m} generated by si = (i, i + 1)(i, i + 1), i = 1, ..., m − 1 and sm = (m, m)
where for a 6= b (a, b) is the simple transposition which switches a and b. We denote by lB the length
function corresponding to the set of generators si , i = 1, ...m.
The Weyl group WDm of so2m can be regarded as the sub group of the permutation group of
{m, ..., 2, 1, 1, 2, ..., m} generated by si = (i, i + 1)(i, i + 1), i = 1, ..., m − 1 and s′m = (m, m − 1)(m −
1, m). We denote by lD the length function corresponding to the set of generators s′m and si ,
i = 1, ...m − 1.
Note that WDm ⊂ WBm and any w ∈ WBm verifies w(i) = w(i) for i ∈ {1, ..., m}. The action of w on
β = (β1 , ..., βm ) ∈ Pm is given by

                                       w · (β1 , ..., βm ) = (β1w , ..., βm
                                                                          w
                                                                            )

where βiw = βw(i) if σ(i) ∈ {1, ..., m} and βiw = −βw(i) otherwise.
The half sums ρBm , ρCm and ρDm of the positive roots associated to each root system Bm , Cm and
Dm verify:
                  1     3      1
        ρBm = (m − , m − , ..., ), ρCm = (m, m − 1, ..., 1) and ρBm = (m − 1, m − 2, ..., 0).
                  2     2      2
In the sequel we identify the symmetric group Sm with the sub group of WBm or WDm generated by
the si ’s, i = 1, ..., m − 1.

2.2    Schur functions and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials
We now briefly review the notions of Schur functions and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated to
the roots systems Bm , Cm and Dm and refer the reader to [12] for more details. For any weight
β = (β1 , ..., βm ) ∈ πm we set xβ = xβ1 1 · · · xβmm where x1 , ..., xm are fixed indeterminates. We set
                                                    X
                                        aβ =            (−1)l(σ) (w · xβ )
                                              w∈WBm

where w · xµ = xw(µ) . The Schur function sβ is defined by
                                                         aβ+ρBm
                                               sB
                                                β
                                                  m
                                                    =           .
                                                          aρBm

When ν ∈ πm  + , sBm is the Weyl character of V (ν) the finite dimensional irreducible module with
                  ν
highest weight ν. For any w ∈ WBm , the dot action of w on β ∈ πm is defined by

                                       w ◦ β = w · (β + ρBm ) − ρBm .

                                                         4
We have the following straightening law for the Schur functions. For any β ∈ πm , sB   β
                                                                                         m
                                                                                           = 0 or there
                                    B
                      + such that s m = (−1)l(w) sBm with w ∈ W                                     −1
exists a unique ν ∈ πm              β               ν               Bm and ν = w ◦ β. Set K = Z[q, q ]
                                                         β                         W
and write K[πm ] for the K-module generated by the x , β ∈ πm . Set CBm = K[πm ] Bm = {f ∈ K[πm ],
w · f = f for any w ∈ WBm }. Then {sB              +
                                         ν }, ν ∈ πm is a basis of K[πm ]

We define sβ and sβ belonging to CCm = CBm and CDm in the same way when β ∈ πm                       m
and we obtain similarly that {sC ν
                                   m
                                     }, ν ∈ π + and {sDm }, ν ∈ π + are respectively bases of C

CDm .

The q-analogue PqBm of the Kostant’s partition function corresponding to the root system Bm is
defined by the equality
                                Y       1        X
                                            α

Note that PqBm (β) = 0 if β is not a linear combination of positive roots of RB   m
                                                                                    with nonnegative
                                   C      D

                                    m       m

ated to the root systems Cm and Dm . Given λ and µ two partitions of length m, the Kostka-Foulkes
polynomials of types Bm , Cm and Dm are then respectively defined by

                         Bm

    Proof. By commutting the rows i and i + 1 in the determinant (6) we see that usi ◦α = −uα . This
implies that uσ◦α = (−1)l(σ) uα for any σ ∈ Sm . Then it follows from the definition of the dot action
that uα = 0 or there exists γ ∈ πm and σ ∈ Sm such that γ1 ≥ · · · ≥ γm and γ = σ ◦ α. In this last
case we have uα = (−1)l(σ) uγ . Now if there exists a negative γi , uγ = 0 since all the Hk which appear
in the lowest row of (6) are equal to 0. The proof is similar for vβ .

Note that these maps are not ring homomorphisms. For the roots systems Cm and Dm we define
respectively the maps hCm , HCm , uCm , eCm , ECm , vCm and hDm , HDm , uDm , eDm , EDm , vDm similarly.
Let ωm and Ωm be the endomorphisms of Lm corresponding respectively to the multiplication by
               Y        xi     Y              1                Y          xi      Y            1
      φm =         (1 − )            (1 −         ) and Φm =         (1 − )             (1 −       ).

Since φ−1        −1
        m and Φm belong to Lm , ωm and Ωm are the automorphisms of Lm corresponding to the
multiplication by φ−1     −1
                   m and Φm .

Proposition 3.2.1 We have
  1. um = hm · ωm and um = Hm · Ωm ,
  2. vm = em · ωm and vm = Em · Ωm .
    Proof. 1 : We have seen that hm is not a ring-homomorphism. Nevertheless we have by definition
of the hα
                          hm (xα ) = hm (xα1 1 ) · · · hm (xαmm ) = hα1 · · · hαm .
More generally if P1 , ..., Pm are polynomials respectively in the indeterminates x1 , ..., xm , we have
                         hm (P1 (x1 ) · · · Pm (xm )) = hm (P1 (x1 )) · · · hm (Pm (xm ))
by linearity of hm . We can write
                X              α1 −σ(1)+1 α2 −σ(2)+2    α2 −σ(2)           αm −σ(m)+m    αm −σ(m)−m+2
      δm (α) =       (−1)l(σ) xσ(1)      (xσ(2)      + xσ(2)     ) · · · (xσ(m)       + xσ(m)         )
               σ∈Sm

and by the previous argument
              X
hm (δm (α)) =     (−1)l(σ) hα1 −σ(1)+1 (hα2 −σ(2)+2 + hα2 −σ(2) ) · · · (hαm −σ(m)+m + hαm −σ(m)−m+2 ) = uα
              σ∈Sm

where the last equality follows from Proposition 3.1.1. By (7) we have δm (α) = ωm (xα ). Thus by
applying hm to this equality we obtain hm (ωm (xα )) = uα = um (xα ). Hence um = hm · ωm . We derive
the equality um = Hm · Ωm in a similar way starting from
                    X              α1 −σ(1)+1    α2 −σ(1)−1           αm −σ(m)+m    αm −σ(m)−m
          ∆m (α) =      (−1)l(σ) (xσ(1)       + xσ(1)       ) · · · (xσ(m)       + xσ(m)       ).
                      σ∈Sm

   2 : The arguments are the same than in 1 once replacing the characters h and H respectively by
the characters e and E.

   Consider α = (α1 , ..., αm ) ∈ πm and two integers i, j such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ m. The raising
operator Ri,j and the lowering operator Li,j are respectively defined on πm by Ri,j (α) = α + εi − εj
and Li,j (α) = α − εi − εj . From the previous lemma we obtain:

Then by 1 of Proposition 3.2.1, we have for any µ ∈                   +,

where the last equality follows from Proposition 3.1.1. This is exactly equivalent to

                                          hµ =        f (α)uµ+α .
                                                       α∈πm

From Lemma 3.1.2 we deduce that for any α ∈ πm we have uµ+α = 0 or there exits a partition λ such
that µ + α = σ(λ + ρm P       and uµ+α = (−1)l(σ) uλ . By setting α = σ(λ + ρm ) − µ − ρm in the above
                       ) − ρm P
sum we obtain hµ = λ∈πm σ∈Sm (−1)l(σ) f (σ(λ + ρm ) − µ − ρm )uλ . The arguments are similar for
the other assertions.
From relations (i) and by using the fact that uλ = sλ for any partition λ of length m, we derive the
equalities                           X                       X

are respectively the multiplicities of V (λ) in h(µ) and H(µ). Note that uλ,µ = 0 and Uλ,µ = 0 unless
|µ| ≥ |λ| .
For the relations (ii) the situation is more complicated since the partitions ν obtained by applying
straightening laws to the vµ′ +β yields polynomials vν where ν ∈ πn+ is a partition of length n so can
not be necessarily regarded as the conjugate partition of a partition λ ∈ πm + . The straightening law of

Lemma 3.1.2 implies that |ν| = |µ | . Since |µ| = |µ | , this problem disappear if we suppose m ≥ |µ|
since we will have ν1 ≤ |ν| ≤ m and thus ν ′ ∈ πm  + . We can then set ν = λ′ with λ ∈ π and obtain
                                                                                         m

4.2     Some q-analogues of multiplicities of V (λ) in h(µ), H(µ), e(µ) or E(µ)
Given λ and µ two partitions of length m, let cλ,µ (q) and Cλ,µ (q) be the two polynomials defined by

               X                                                              X
uλ,µ (q) =            (−1)l(σ) fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − µ − ρm ) and Uλ,µ (q) =             (−1)l(σ) Fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − µ − ρm ).

Then from the equalities (8) and (9) we obtain:

Proposition 4.2.1 Let λ and µ be two partitions of length m. Then

    1. uλ,µ (q) and Uλ,µ (q) are q-analogues of the multiplicity of the representation V (λ) in h(µ) and
       H(µ),

    2. vλ,µ (q) = uλ,′ µ′ (q) and Vλ,µ (q) = Uλ′ ,µ′ (q) are q-analogues of the multiplicity of the representation
       V (λ) in e(µ) and E(µ) when the condition m ≥ |µ| is satisfied.

The following example is obtained from the explicit computation of the function fq when m = 2.

Example 4.2.2 Consider µ a partition of length 2 and set Eµ = {λ ∈ π2+ , λ = (µ1 + r − s, µ2 − r − s),
s ∈ {0, ..., µ2 }, r ∈ {0, ..., µ2 − s}}. Then for any partition λ of length 2 we have:

                                                      q 1 1 if λ ∈ Eµ
                                          uλ,µ (q) =                    .
                                                        0 otherwise

Remarks
(i) : It follows from the definition of the q-functions fq and Fq that cλ,µ (q) = Cλ,µ (q) = 0 if |λ| > |µ| .
(ii) : It is not trivial from the very definitions that uλ,µ (q) and Uλ,µ (q) are polynomials in q with
nonnegative integer coefficients. This property will be proved in Section 5 as a corollary of Theorem
5.1.5.

5     The duality theorems
5.1     A duality theorem for the q-multiplicities in h(µ) and H(µ)
For any nonnegative integer m, set κm = (1, ..., 1) ∈ πm .

Lemma 5.1.1 Consider λ, µ two partitions of length m such that |λ| ≥ |µ| . Let k be any integer such
that k ≥ |λ|−|µ|
            2    . Then we have
                                               X
                        Kλ+kκm ,µ+kκm (q) =          (−1)l(σ) Pq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm ))                  (12)
                                              σ∈Sm

where the sum is indexed by the elements of the symmetric group Sm .

    Proof. Since Pq (α) = 0 if α is not a linear combination of positive roots with nonnegative
coefficients, we have Pq (α) = 0 for any α ∈ πm such that |α| < 0. Consider δ = (δ1 , ..., δm ) ∈ πm
                                       w ) and denote by E
and w ∈ Wn . Write w(δ) = (δ1w , ..., δm                  w,δ =P
                                                               {i1 , ..., ip } the set of the indices ip such
               w
that δik and δik have opposite signs. Define the sum Sw,δ = ip ∈Ew,δ δik . Then |w(δ)| = |δ| − 2Sw,δ .
Now consider k a nonnegative integer and set δ = (λ + ρm + kκm ). We have |w(λ + ρm + kκm )| =
|(λ + ρm + kκm )| − 2Sw,δ . But Sw,δ = Sw,λ+ρm + kp. Thus we obtain

    |w(λ + ρm + kκm ) − (µ + ρm + kκm )| = |(λ + ρm + kκm )| − 2Sw,λ+ρm − |(µ + ρm + kκm )| − 2kp =
                                                                                |λ| − |µ| − 2Sw,λ+ρm − 2kp.

When w ∈ / Sm , we have p ≥ 1 and Sw,λ+ρm ≥ 1 since the coordinates of λ + ρm are all positive. Hence
|w(λ + ρm + kκm ) − (µ + ρm + kκm )| < |λ| − |µ| − 2k and is negative as soon as k ≥ |λ|−|µ|
                                                                                         2   . For such
an integer k the sum defining Kλ+kκm ,µ+kκm (q) normally running on Wm can be restricted to (12) and
we obtain
                                  X
              Kλ+kκm ,µ+kκm (q) =      (−1)l(σ) Pq (σ(λ + ρm + kκm ) − (µ + ρm + kκm )).

Since σ ∈ Sm , we have σ(kκm ) = kκm . Thus

                    Kλ+kκm ,µ+kκm (q) =     (−1)l(σ) Pq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm )).

Set α = I(β). The equality becomes
                                                        X

                                                        α∈πm

and from the definition (see 11) of the function Fq , we obtain PqBm (I(α)) = Fq (α). The assertion with
fq is proved in the same way by considering the root system Dm .

Given σ ∈ Sm , denote by σ ∗ the permutation defined by
                                                 σ ∗ (k) = σ(m − k + 1).
For any i ∈ {1, ..., m − 1}, we have s∗i = sm−i so that l(σ) = l(σ ∗ ). The following Lemma is straight-
forward:

Lemma 5.1.3 The map σ → σ ∗ is an involution of the group Sm and we have σ(I(β)) = I(σ ∗ (β))
for any β ∈ πm , σ ∈ Sm .

Lemma 5.1.4 Let λ, µ two partitions of length m and σ ∈ Sm . Then
                                                               ∗
        (−1)l(σ) fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm )) = (−1)l(σ ) PqDm (σ ∗ (I(λ) + ρm ) − (I(µ) + ρm )) and
                                                                   ∗
            (−1)l(σ) Fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρ)) = (−1)l(σ ) PqCm (σ ∗ (I(λ) + ρm ) − (I(µ) + ρm )).

   Proof. Since l(σ) = l(σ ∗ ), it suffices to prove the equalities
                  fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm )) = PqDm (σ(I(λ) + ρm ) − (I(λ) + ρm )) and
                    Fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm )) = PqCm (σ(I(µ) + ρm ) − (I(µ) + ρm )).

Set P = PqCm (σ ∗ (I(λ) + ρm ) − (I(µ) + ρm )). From the above Lemma we deduce

                                 P = PqCm (I(σ(λ) + σ ∗ (ρm ) − I(µ) − ρm ).
Now an immediate computation shows that σ ∗ (ρm ) − ρm = I(σ(ρm ) − ρm ). Thus we derive
                     P = PqCm (I(σ(λ + ρm ) − µ − ρm )) = Fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − µ − ρm )
where the last equality follows from Lemma 5.1.2.
We obtain the equality fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm )) = PqDm (σ(I(λ) + ρm ) − (I(λ) + ρm )) in a similar way.

                                         Uλ,µ (q) = KbCm              (q)

    Proof. First λ b and µb are clearly partitions of length m since n = max(λ1 , µ1 ). It follows from the
definition of Uλ,µ (q) and the above lemma that
            X                                           X          ∗
Uλ,µ (q) =      (−1)l(σ) Fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − µ − ρm ) =        (−1)l(σ ) PqCm (σ ∗ (I(λ) + ρm )) − (I(µ) + ρm )).
           σ∈Sm                                         σ∗ ∈Sm

Then by Lemma 5.1.3 we obtain
                             X
                  Uλ,µ (q) =   (−1)l(σ) PqCm (σ(I(λ) + ρm )) − (I(µ) + ρm )).
                                  σ∈Sm

We have σ(λ∗ + ρm + nκm ) = σ(λ∗ + ρm ) + nκm since σ ∈ Sm . So we can write
                        X
             Uλ,µ (q) =    (−1)l(σ) PqCm (σ(I(λ) + nκm + ρm )) − (I(µ) + nκm + ρm )).
                          σ∈Sm

      b = I(λ) + nκm and µ
Since λ                   b = I(µ) + nκm we derive
                          X
               Uλ,µ (q) =                    b + ρm ) − (b
                            (−1)l(σ) P Cm (σ(λ           µ + ρm )) = K Cm                    (q)
                                           q                                   b
                                                                               λ+kκ m ,b
                                                                                       µ+kκm
                           σ∈Sm

by Lemma 5.1.1.
We obtain similarly the equality uλ,µ (q) = KbDm                  (q) by replacing PqCm by PqDm .
                                                  λ+kκm ,b
                                                         µ+kκm

Example 5.1.6 Consider µ = (4, 2, 1) and λ = (2, 1, 0). We have n = 4, µ                                   b =
                                                                                         b = (3, 2, 0) and λ
(4, 3, 2). We choose k = 2. Then we obtain the equalities
                        (              Dm
                           uλ,µ (q) = K(6,5,4),(5,4,2) (q) = q 3 + q 2

                           Uλ,µ (q) = K(6,5,4),(5,4,2)) (q) = q 5 + 2q 4 + 3q 3 + 2q 2

By using the fact that the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials have nonnegative integer coefficients [9] we
obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 5.1.7 The polynomials uλ,µ (q) and Uλ,µ (q) have nonnegative integers coefficients.

We also recover a property of the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated to the root system Am proved
in [8].

Corollary 5.1.8 Consider λ, µ two partitions of length m such that |λ| = |µ| and set n = max(λ1 , µ1 ).
Then the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated to the root system Am verifies

    Proof. Suppose that β is a linear combination of I(RC    m
                                                               ) with nonnegative coefficients such that
|β| = 0. Then β is necessarily a linear combination of the roots εi − εj , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m with nonnegative
coefficients (see (13)) that is, a linear combination with nonnegative coefficients of the positive roots
associated to the root system Am . This implies that
                                        fq (β) = Fq (β) = PqAm (β)
where PqAm is the q-Kostant’s partition function associated to the root system Am . For any σ ∈ Sm ,
we have |σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm )| = 0 since |λ| = |µ| . Thus
       fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm )) = Fq (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm )) = PqAm (σ(λ + ρm ) − (µ + ρm ))
                                                                                          Am
and the multiplicities uλ,µ (q) and Uλ,µ (q) coincide with the Kostka-Foulkes polynomial Kλ,µ (q) when
|λ| = |µ| . Moreover by applying Theorem 5.1.5 with |λ| = |µ| and k = 0, we obtain Uλ,µ (q) =
KbCm (q) = KbAm (q) where the last equality is due to the fact that the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials
  λ,b
    µ          λ,b
                 µ
of types Bm , Cm or Dm are Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated to the root system Am when
                                        Am
|λ| = |µ| . So we derive the equality Kλ,µ  (q) = KbAm (q).

Recall that the combinatorial R-matrix associated to crystals Bk is equivalent to the description of
the crystal graph isomorphisms                      ≃

the number of highest weight vertices of weight λ in the crystal Bµ = Bµ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Bµm . Then Xλ,µ (q)
is defined by

where Eλ is the set of highest weight vertices b = b1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ bm in Bµ of highest weight λ, bj          is

                                        Uλ,µ (q) = q |µ|−|λ| Xλ,µ (q).
Note that the conjecture is in particular true for all the examples given in the tables of [13].

Consider λ, µ two partitions of length l such that l ≥ |µ| ≥ |λ| . Write m = max(λ1 , µ1 ). Then by
adding to λ′ and µ′ the required numbers of parts 0 we can consider them as partitions of length
                                                     e and µ
m. Set n = max(λ′1 , µ′1 ). We define the partitions λ                          e = (n − λ′ , ..., n − λ′ )

Theorem 5.2.1 With the above notations, we have for any integer k ≥                        2
                                   (

                                                            λ+kκm ,e
                                                                   µ+kκm
                                                                                    .

   Proof. Since l ≥ |µ| , we have by Proposition 4.2.1 the equality vλ,µ (q) = uλ′ ,µ′ (q). Moreover we
                                   ′    ′|
have n ≥ max(λ′1 , µ′1 ) and k ≥ |µ |−|λ
                                     2     for |λ′ | = |λ| and |µ′ | = |µ| . Hence by applying Theorem 5.1.5 we
                    Dm
obtain vλ,µ (q) = K b′       b′    (q) where λb′ = (n−λ′m , ..., n−λ′1 ) = λ  e and µb′ = (n−µ′ , ..., n−µ′ ) = µ
                                                                                               m          1     e.
                    λ +kκm ,µ +kκm
So (i) is proved. We obtain (ii) similarly.

Example 5.2.2 For λ = (2, 1, 0, 0, 0) and µ = (2, 2, 1, 0, 0) we have l = 5, m = 2. Moreover λ′ = (2, 1),
                          e = (2, 1) and µ
µ′ = (3, 2) and n = 3. So λ                e = (1, 0). Hence for k = 1
                              (                      Dm
                                  (i) : vλ,µ (q) = K(3,2),(2,1) (q) = q

Remark When λ, µ are considered as weight associated to the root system Cl , the above theorem is
essentially the quantification of a duality result explicited by Foulle [2] from results of [5] for the dual
pair (Sp(2l), Sp(2m)).

                                        P
which implies the equality PqCm (β) = η+δ=β cC     m |δ|/2

can suppose |η| = 0 and |δ| = |β| in the previous sum. Then δ ∈ Ckm and the result follows immediately.
The proof for PqDm (β) is similar.

Suppose that λ is a partition of length m and consider γ belonging to πm . Then we can define the

                                                                                                                  µ+δ

   Proof. We have seen in the proof of Theorem 5.1.5 that
                                X
                       Uλ,µ =                        b + ρm ) − (b
                                    (−1)l(σ) PqCm (σ(λ           µ + ρm )).
                                           σ∈Sm

Hence from the above lemma we derive
                        X            X
                Uλ,µ =     cCm |δ|/2                    b + ρm ) − (b
                                       (−1)l(σ) PqAm (σ(λ
                            δ q                                     µ + δ + ρm ))
                            δ∈Ckm                   σ∈Sm

                                                P                      b + ρm ) − (b
which yields the desired result since KbAm (q) = σ∈Sm (−1)l(σ) PqAm (σ(λ           µ + δ + ρm )).
                                       λ,b

From the above proposition and Proposition 4.2.1 we deduce by setting q = 1 :

Corollary 6.2.2 With the notations of Theorems 5.1.5 and 5.2.1 the following assertions holds.
