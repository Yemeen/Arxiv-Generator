                                                   Abstract. In this paper, we generalize a result by Berman and Billig on weight
                                                   modules over Lie algebras with polynomial multiplication. More precisely, we show
                                                   that a highest weight module with an exp-polynomial “highest weight” has finite
                                                   dimensional weight spaces. We also get a class of irreducible weight modules with
                                                   finite dimensional weight spaces over generalized Virasoro algebras which do not occur
                                                   over the classical Virasoro algebra.

                                                Representations of affine Lie algebras and the Virasoro algebra have many im-
                                             portant applications in mathematics and physics. One of the main ingredients of
                                             these theories is the construction of the highest weight modules. Recently there
                                             has been substantial activity in developing representation theories for higher rank

infinite dimensional Lie algebras, in particular toroidal Lie algebras, generalized
Virasoro algebras and quantum torus algebras (see [EM], [GL], [L], [BS], [G], [BB],
[B1], [B2], [Ma], [HWZ]).
   Unlike rank one algebras (affine and Virasoro), the higher rank infinite dimen-
sional Lie algebras do not possess a triangular decomposition, which makes the stan-
dard construction of the highest weight modules inapplicable. Nonetheless, there
have been found several explicit realizations of representations for these algebras
using the vertex operator approach.
   In the vertex constructions the highest weight is replaced with a loop-like module
for the subalgebra of degree zero (in general, this subalgebra is not commutative).
Let us describe in brief these representations from the perspective of the highest
weight modules.
   Let G be a Z × Zn -graded Lie algebra and let G = G− ⊕ G(0) ⊕ G+ be a decom-
position of G relative to Z-grading. The subalgebra G(0) is an infinite-dimensional
Lie algebra of rank n. We take some natural module V for G(0) (usually V is either
Zn -graded or finite dimensional). Parallel to the construction of a highest weight
module, we let G+ act on V trivially, and introduce the induced module

                      f(V ) = IndG(0) + V ≃ U (G− ) ⊗C V.
                      M          G +G


If V is Zn -graded then Mf(V ) inherits a Z × Zn -grading, and it is Z-graded when V
is finite-dimensional.
    The difficulty here is that M f(V ) will have infinite-dimensional homogeneous
components (and thus will not have a character). Nonetheless the explicit vertex
operator constructions show that in some cases M    f(V ) has quotients with finite-
dimensional homogeneous components. This situation has been clarified in [BB],
where it was proved that M    f(V ) has a graded factor-module M (V ) with finite-
dimensional components provided that G is a polynomial Lie algebra and V is a
polynomial module. The polynomiality condition means that the structure con-
stants of the Lie algebra and of the module are given by polynomial expressions
(see Section 1 for the precise definitions). However this left out some important
examples, notably quantum torus Lie algebras. In this paper we expand the class of
Lie algebras and modules for which the theorem is applicable. We prove that M (V )
has finite-dimensional homogeneous components when G is an exp-polynomial Lie
algebra and V is an exp-polynomial module.
    We illustrate our definitions and theorems with a sequence of 24 examples.
   The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we define exp-polynomial Lie alge-
bras, exp-polynomial modules and give the statement of the main results (Theorems
1.5 and 1.7). We provide numerous examples (old and new) of such Lie algebras and
modules as well as give examples of applications of the main theorems. In Section
2 we first establish the extended Vandermonde determinant formula, and then give
the proof of Theorems 1.5 and 1.7. In Section 3 we show a similar but stronger

result for generalized Virasoro algebras to give a class of irreducible weight modules
with finite dimensional weight spaces over generalized Virasoro algebras which do
not occur over the classical Virasoro algebra.

1.   Exp-polynomial Lie algebras and exp-polynomial modules.
    Let C be the complex number field. We assume that all Lie algebras and vec-
tor spaces are over C in this paper, although C can be replaced by any field of
characteristic 0.
    Definition 1.1. The algebra of exp-polynomial functions in r variables, n1 , . . . ,
nr , is the algebra of functions f (n1 , . . . , nr ) : Zr → C generated as an algebra by
functions nj and anj , where a ∈ C∗ = C \ {0}, j = 1, . . . , r.
    An exp-polynomial function may be written as a finite sum
                                       X X
                f (n1 , . . . , nr ) =             ck,a nk11 . . . nkr r an1 1 . . . anr r ,
                                    k∈Zr+ a∈(C∗ )r

where ck,a ∈ C, k = (k1 , . . . , kr ) with kj ≥ 0, and a = (a1 , . . . , ar ).
   An exp-polynomial function f (n) has the property that the function f (n + m) is
also exp-polynomial as a function of two variables.
   Definition 1.2. Let G = ⊕α∈Zn Gα be a Zn -graded Lie algebra. Then G is
said to be an exp-polynomial Lie algebra if G has a homogeneous spanning set
{gk (α) | k ∈ K, α ∈ Zn } with gk (α) ∈ Gα , and there exists a family of exp-
                          s
polynomial functions {fk,r   (α, β) | k, r, s ∈ K} in the 2n variables αj , βj and where
                           s
for each k, r the set {s|fk,r (α, β) 6= 0} is finite, such that
                         X
                               s
      [gk (α), gr (β)] =     fk,r (α, β)gs (α + β), for k, r ∈ K, α, β ∈ Zn .       (1.1)
                        s∈K

This homogeneous spanning set {gk (α) | k ∈ K, α ∈ Zn } is call a distinguished
spanning set.
                      s
   If the functions fk,r   (α, β) in (1.1) are in fact polynomials, we say that G is a
polynomial Lie algebra (cf. [Definition 1.6, BB]).
   Example 1. Let g be a finite dimensional Lie algebra with a basis B = {gk }k∈K .
Then the toroidal Lie algebra G = C[t±                 ±
                                          1 , . . . , tn ]⊗g is a polynomial Lie algebra with
the distinguished spanning set gk (α) = tα gk , α ∈ Zn , where here and elsewhere in
this paper tα = tα         αn
                  1 . . . tn . The Lie bracket in G is
                   1



                              [gk (α), gr (β)] = [gk , gr ](α + β).

   Example 2. Let Rn = C[t±1                    ±1
                                   1 , . . . , tn ]. The Witt algebra (or Cartan type W
Lie algebra) is the Lie algebra Wn = Der(Rn ) = Span {tα ∂i |α ∈ Zn , 1 ≤ i ≤ n},
where ∂i = ti ∂t∂ i . The bracket in Wn is given by

                          [tα ∂i , tβ ∂j ] = βi tα+β ∂j − αj tα+β ∂i .
4                                      BILLIG AND ZHAO

Thus Wn is a polynomial Lie algebra.
   Example 3. The following family of algebras plays an important role in the
representation theory of toroidal Lie algebras. Let Ω1n be the space of 1-forms on
                Pn
a torus: Ω1n =     Rn kp , where kp = t−1
                                        p dtp . We define a 2-parametric family of
                   p=1
algebras
                                  V (µ, ν) = Wn ⊕ Ω1n /dRn .
The distinguished spanning set is

                             {dj (α), kj (α)|α ∈ Zn , j = 1, . . . n},

where dj (α) = tα ∂j , kj (α) = tα kj . The Lie bracket in V (µ, ν) is given by
                                                             n
                                                             X
                   [di (α), kj (β)] = βi kj (α + β) + δij          αp kp (α + β),
                                                             p=1

                                                                              n
                                                                              X
    [di (α), dj (β)] = βi dj (α + β) − αj di (α + β) + (µβi αj + ναi βj )           βp kp (α + β),
                                                                              p=1

                                       [ki (α), kj (β)] = 0.
Note that the distinguished spanning set for this polynomial Lie algebra is not a
basis because of the linear dependencies between kj (α): α1 k1 (α)+. . .+αn kn (α) = 0.
  Next we will give an example of a Lie algebra which is exp-polynomial, but not
polynomial.
  Example 4. Consider an associative quantum torus

                                      Cq =         ⊕    Cti0 tα
                                             i∈Z,α∈Zn


generated by the variables t±           ±            ±
                                   0 , t1 , . . . , tn , where t1 , . . . , tn commute and t0 does
not commute with t1 , . . . , tn , but satisfies the relations: tj t0 = qj t0 tj , for some
q1 , . . . , qn ∈ C∗ . The Lie algebra which is obtained from the associative algebra Cq
is an exp-polynomial Lie algebra with the distinguished set ti0 (α) = ti0 tα , and the
Lie bracket given by [ti0 (α), tj0 (β)] = (q jα −q iβ )t0i+j (α + β). Here q jα = q1jα1 . . . qnjαn .
    Definition 1.3. Let G = ⊕α∈Zn Gα be an exp-polynomial Lie algebra. A G
module V = ⊕α∈Zn Vα is called a Zn -graded exp-polynomial module if V has a basis
{vj (α)}j∈J,α∈Zn , and there exists a family of exp-polynomial functions hsk,j (α, β)
for k ∈ K, j, s ∈ J such that
                                               X
                            gk (α)vj (β) =           hsk,j (α, β)vs (α + β),
                                             s∈J
                  MODULES WITH EXPONENTIAL HIGHEST WEIGHT                                       5

where {gk (α)}k∈K is the distinguished spanning set for G, and for each k, j the set
{s|hsk,j (α, β) 6= 0} is finite. The homogeneous components of the Zn -grading on
V = ⊕ Vα are given by Vα = Span {vj (α)}j∈J .
     α∈Zn
   Note that if G is a Lie algebra with polynomial multiplication and all hsk,j are
polynomial functions, then the module V is actually a polynomial module defined
in [Definition 1.8, BB].
   Example 5. Let V1 , . . . , Vk be finite dimensional modules for a finite dimen-
                                                 n
sional Lie algebra g. Fix q1 , . . . , qk ∈ (C∗ ) . We define on the space V =
Rn ⊗ V1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Vk the structure of an exp-polynomial module for the toroidal
Lie algebra G = Rn ⊗ g by
                                        k
                                        X
            g(α)v1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ vk (β) =         qpαp v1 ⊗ . . . (gvp ) ⊗ . . . ⊗ vk (α + β),
                                        p=1


where v1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ vk (β) = tβ v1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ vk . It is easy to see that in general V is an
exp-polynomial module and not a polynomial module.
   Example 6. A tensor module for the Witt algebra Wn is a polynomial module.
Let V0 be a finite-dimensional gln module. Then the tensor module V = Rn ⊗ V0
is a module for Wn under the action
                                                        n
                                                        X
                     α
                    t ∂j v(β) = βj v(α + β) +                 αp (Epj v)(α + β),
                                                        p=1


where v(β) = tβ ⊗ v, and Epj are the elementary matrices in gln . The families
{vi (β)} with {vi } being a basis of V0 , form a distinguished basis in V , for which the
structure constants are polynomials.
   We extend [Definition 1.6, BB] to give the following
   Definition 1.4. Let G be a Zn -graded exp-polynomial Lie algebra. We call this
algebra Zn -extragraded if G has another Z-gradation

                                         G = ⊕ G(i) ,                                        (1.2)
                                                 i∈Z

and the set K is a disjoint union of finite subsets Ki ,

                                         K = ∪ Ki ,
                                                  i∈Z

such that the elements of the homogeneous spanning set {gk (α) | k ∈ Ki , α ∈ Zn }
are homogeneous of degree i under this new Z-gradation and span G(i) .
   Many important infinite-dimensional Lie algebras are in fact Zn -extragraded exp-
polynomial Lie algebras. Here we give some examples.
6                                     BILLIG AND ZHAO

     Example 8. We slightly modify Example 1 to get an extragraded algebra.
Adding an extra variable t0 , we get an n + 1 toroidal Lie algebra Rn+1 ⊗ g, where
Rn+1 = C[t±             ±            ±                   n
                   0 , t1 , . . . , tn ]. We consider a Z -grading on this algebra by degrees in
t1 , . . . , tn , and a Z grading by degree in t0 . The distinguished spanning set is

                                       ti0 gk (α) = ti0 tα gk ,

with i ∈ Z, α ∈ Zn , and {gk } being a basis of g.
   The previous example can be generalized in two ways:
                                                                      (0)
   Example 9. Let G(0) be an exp-polynomial Lie algebra with Gα being finite
dimensional for all α ∈ Zn . Then G = C[t0 , t−1   0 ] ⊗ G
                                                          (0)
                                                              is an extragraded exp-
polynomial Lie algebra.
   Example 10. Let g be a Z-graded Lie algebra with finite-dimensional homoge-
neous components. Then G = g ⊗ Rn is an extragraded exp-polynomial Lie algebra.
   Remark. In the definition of an exp-polynomial Lie algebra we can relax the
requirement that each family {gk (α)} be defined for all α ∈ Zn . We may instead
require that {gk (α)} is defined for α in some sublattice Lk ⊂ Zn . Of course in this
case we should have a restriction so that the expression in the right hand side of
(1.1) is well defined.
   Example 11. With this relaxed definition we may consider the following as an
extragraded exp-polynomial Lie algebra:

                              G = g ⊗ Rn+1 ⊕ Der C[t0 , t−1
                                                         0 ]

for a finite dimensional Lie algebra g with the distinguished spanning set {ti0 gk (α),
ti0 ∂0 |i ∈ Z, α ∈ Zn , gk ∈ B}. Here the sublattice that corresponds to the elements
ti0 ∂0 is L = (0).
     Example 12. Introducing an extra variable t0 we can construct an extragraded
version of the Lie algebra from Example 3:

                           V (µ, ν) = DerRn+1 ⊕ Ω1n+1 /dRn+1 .

The Z-grading is by degree in t0 , and the distinguished spanning families are
ti0 dj (α) = ti0 tα ∂j and ti0 kj (α) = ti0 tα kj .
     Example 13. The exp-polynomial Lie algebra from Example 4 is actually ex-
tragraded. The Z-grading on it is by degree in t0 .
     Example 14. Let Rn+1 = C[t±1                          ±1           ±1
                                                      0 , t1 , . . . , tn ], Wn+1 = Der(Rn+1 ) =
Span {ti0 tα ∂k , ti0 tα ∂0 |i ∈ Z, α ∈ Zn , 1 ≤ k ≤ n}. The Lie bracket in Wn+1 is
given by
                   [ti0 tα ∂k , tj0 tβ ∂s ] = t0i+j tα+β (βk ∂s − αs ∂k ), 1 ≤ k, s ≤ n,
                  [ti0 tα ∂0 , tj0 tβ ∂s ] = t0i+j tα+β (j∂s − αs ∂0 ), 1 ≤ s ≤ n,

                            [ti0 tα ∂0 , tj0 tβ ∂0 ] = (j − i)t0i+j tα+β ∂0 .
It can be easily seen that Wn+1 is a Zn -extragraded Lie algebra.
   Cartan type S Lie algebras Sn+1 are also Zn -extragraded polynomial Lie al-
gebras. However we do not know whether Cartan type H or K Lie algebras are
Zn -extragraded polynomial Lie algebras.

C-basis Lx  x ∈ Z2 and subject to the following commutator relations

where x = (x , x ), y = (y , y ),                 =                 . It can be easily seen
                                               x      x(1) x(2)
that L is a Z1 -extragraded Lie algebra.
   From now on we assume that G is a Zn -extragraded Lie algebra with gradations
                                              (i)
(1.1) and (1.2), i.e., G = ⊕i∈Z, α∈Zn Gα is a Zn+1 -graded Lie algebra which has
                                      (i)                                     (i)       (i)
a homogeneous spanning set {gk (α) | k ∈ Ki , (i, α) ∈ Zn+1 } with gk (α) ∈ Gα ,

and there exists a family of exp-polynomial functions {fk,m,i,j          (α, β)} in the 2n
variables αp , βp where k ∈ Ki , m ∈ Kj , s ∈ Ki+j and where for each k, m, i, j the
        s

   Let G+ = ⊕ G(i) , G− = ⊕ G(i) . Then we have the decomposition
              i≥1                 i≤−1


                                     G = G− ⊕ G(0) ⊕ G+ .                                     (1.4)

   Note that G(0) is a Zn -graded exp-polynomial Lie algebra.
   Following the construction in [BB], we now introduce our Zn+1 -graded module
over Zn+1 -graded Lie algebra G.
   Assume V = ⊕α∈Zn Vα is a Zn -graded G(0) module with exp-polynomial action
as defined in Definition 1.3. We can define the action of G+ on V by G+ V = 0 and
then consider the induced module
                        f(V ) = IndG(0) + V ≃ U (G− ) ⊗C V.
                        M                                                                     (1.5)
                                   G +G

                 f(V ) is a Zn+1 -graded module over G and
It is clear that M

                                  f(V ) =
                                  M                ⊕      f(V )(i) ,

where M f(V )(i)                                    f     (0)
              α is naturally defined, for example, M (V )α = Vα . In general, the
homogeneous components M   f(V )(i)
                                  α with i < 0 are infinite-dimensional.
                         f(V ) has a unique maximal proper Zn+1 -graded submodule
  It is easy to see that M

Then we have the induced Zn+1 -gradation
                               M (V ) =      ⊕       M (V )(i)

    The main result of this paper is the following theorem.
   Theorem 1.5. Assume that G is a Zn -extragraded Lie algebra with grading (1.3),
V = ⊕α∈Zn Vα is a Zn -graded exp-polynomial G(0) module as defined in Definition
1.3 with J being finite. Then the Zn+1 -graded G module M (V ) defined in (1.7)
                                                             (i)
has finite-dimensional homogeneous spaces, i.e., dim M (V )α < ∞, for all i ∈ Z,
α ∈ Zn .
   If G(0) is a polynomial Lie algebra and V is a polynomial Zn -graded G(0) module,
the claim of Theorem 1.5 was proved in [Theorem 1.12, BB].
   Example 16. Let us consider an n + 1-toroidal Lie algebra G = Rn+1 ⊗ g as
defined in Example 8. Its component G(0) is an n-toroidal Lie algebra. We consider
a module V = Rn ⊗ V1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Vk for G(0) which was described in Example 5.
By the above theorem, the G module M (V ) has finite-dimensional homogeneous
components. Such modules were studied by Chari [C] and Rao [E].
   Example 17. Let us consider the Virasoro-like algebra L as defined in Example
15. Let L(i) = ⊕k∈Z CLi,k . Fix an exp-polynomial function f (k). Then V =
⊕j∈Z Cvj becomes an exp-polynomial L(0) module via
                                   L0,k vj = f (k)vj+k .
Then M (V ) has finite dimensional homogeneous spaces.
   Example 18. Consider a Witt algebra Wn+1 = Der C[t±             ±            ±
                                                              0 , t1 , . . . , tn ], which we
view as an extragraded polynomial Lie algebra with Z grading given by degree in t0 .
The zero component with respect to this grading is Wn ⊕ Rn ∂0 . Consider a tensor
module V = Rn ⊗ V0 for Wn as discussed in Example 6. We let Rn ∂0 act upon it
by shifts tα ∂0 · tβ ⊗ v = d tα+β ⊗ v for some fixed constant d ∈ C. By Theorem 1.5
the module M (V ) is a weight module with finite dimensional weight spaces.
   Example 19. Let V (µ, ν) be the extragraded Lie algebra from Example 12. Its
zero component with respect to Z grading is
                                             n

Consider a tensor module V from the previous example on which we define the
action of 1-forms of degree zero (in t0 ) as follows:

                               tα kp · tβ ⊗ v = 0, p = 1, . . . , n,

                        tα k0 · tβ ⊗ v = ctα+β ⊗ v, for some c ∈ C.
Again by Theorem 1.5 the module M (V ) is a weight module with finite dimensional
weight spaces. These modules and their irreducible quotients were studied in [EM],
[L], [BB], [B1], [B2].
    Example 20. Let G be the quantum torus Lie algebra from Example 4. We
consider a module V = C[t±                ±
                               1 , . . . tn ] for G
                                                   (0)
                                                       = C[t±               ±
                                                                 1 , . . . tn ] with the action de-
fined as follows: tα · tβ = f (α, β)tα+β , where f (α, β) is some fixed exp-polynomial
function. By Theorem 1.5 the module M (V ) has finite-dimensional homogeneous
components.
    Example 21. Let g be a simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra with the triangular
decomposition g = g− ⊕h⊕g+ . We consider a finite Z-grading on g compatible with
this decomposition. As explained in Example 10 above, the algebra G = Rn ⊗ g is
an extragraded polynomial Lie algebra. Its zero component is the abelian algebra
G(0) = Rn ⊗ h. Consider a G(0) module V = C[t±                    ±                       α    β
                                                       1 , . . . tn ] with the action t hk · t =
           α+β
fk (α, β)t     , where {hk } forms a basis of h and {fk (α, β)} are some fixed exp-
polynomial functions. Applying again Theorem 1.5 we conclude that M (V ) is a
weight module with finite dimensional weight spaces.
  We would like to discuss now a finite-dimensional version of the exp-polynomial
modules.

   Definition 1.6. Let G = ⊕α∈Zn Gα be an exp-polynomial Lie algebra as de-
fined in Definition 1.2. A G-module V is called a finite-dimensional exp-polynomial
module if V has a finite basis {vj }j∈J , and there exists a family of exp-polynomial
functions hsk,j (α) for k ∈ K, j, s ∈ J such that
                                                X
                                   gk (α)vj =         hsk,j (α)vs ,
                                                s∈J

where {gk (α)}k∈K,α∈Zn is the distinguished spanning set for G.

  Let G be an extragraded exp-polynomial Lie algebra and let V be a finite-
dimensional exp-polynomial module for G(0) . Just as in (1.5) and (1.7) we define a
Z-graded G module M f(V ) and its Z-graded factor-module M (V ) = M  f(V )/Mfrad .

   Theorem 1.7. Let G be a Zn -extragraded Lie algebra with grading (1.3), V be a
finite-dimensional exp-polynomial G(0) module. Then the Z-graded G module M (V )
has finite dimensional homogeneous spaces, i.e., dim M (V )(i) < ∞, for all i ∈ Z.

   Let us now give some examples of the applications of this theorem.
   Example 22. Let G be an n + 1-toroidal Lie algebra G = Rn+1 ⊗ g as defined
in Example 8. Its component G(0) is an n-toroidal Lie algebra. Let V1 , . . . , Vk be
                                                                 n
finite-dimensional modules for g, and let q1 , . . . , qk ∈ (C∗ ) . We define a structure
of a G(0) module on the finite-dimensional space V = V1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Vk in the following
way:
                                      k
                                      X
                g(α)v1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ vk =   qpαp v1 ⊗ . . . (gvp ) ⊗ . . . ⊗ vk .
                                          p=1

It is easy to see that V is a finite-dimensional exp-polynomial module for G(0) .
The induced module M     f(V ) will have infinite-dimensional homogeneous components,
however, by Theorem 1.7, the homogeneous components of its factor M (V ) are
finite-dimensional.
   The next two examples are modifications of Examples 20 and 21.
   Example 23. Let G be the quantum torus Lie algebra from Example 4. We
consider a one-dimensional module C for G(0) = C[t±                ±
                                                        1 , . . . tn ] with the action defined
as follows: tα ·1 = f (α)1, where f (α) is some fixed exp-polynomial function (highest
weight). By Theorem 1.7 the module M (C) has finite-dimensional homogeneous
components.
   Example 24. Let g be a simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra with the triangular
decomposition g = g− ⊕ h ⊕ g+ . As explained in Example 21 above, the algebra
G = Rn ⊗ g is an extragraded polynomial Lie algebra. Its zero component is the
abelian algebra G(0) = Rn ⊗h. Let {h1 , . . . , hℓ } be a basis of h. Fix exp-polynomial
functions f1 (α), . . . , fℓ (α) (highest weight) and consider a one-dimensional G(0)
module C with the action tα hk · 1 = fk (α)1. Applying again Theorem 1.7 we
conclude that M (C) is a Z-graded module with finite dimensional homogeneous
components.

2.   Proof of the main theorems.
   In this section we shall prove Theorems 1.5 and 1.7. The key step in the proof
of Theorem 1.12 in [BB] was the Vandermonde determinant argument. Here we
would need a generalization of the Vandermonde determinant formula for the exp-
polynomial functions.
    Lemma 2.1. Let a1 , . . . , am be elements of a field, s1 , s2 , . . . , sm ∈ N with
s1 + . . . + sm = s. Consider the following sequence of s exp-polynomial functions in
one integer variable: f1 (n) = an1 , f2 (n) = nan1 , . . . , fs1 (n) = ns1 −1 an1 , fs1 +1 (n) =
an2 , . . . , fs1 +s2 (n) = ns2 −1 an2 , . . . , fs (n) = nsm −1 anm . Let V = (vpk ) be the square
s × s matrix where vpk = fk (p − 1), p, k = 1, . . . s. Then
                                              sj (sj −1)

                             j=1                           1≤i<j≤m
                    MODULES WITH EXPONENTIAL HIGHEST WEIGHT                                            11



    Here we use the notation m!! = m! × (m − 1)! × . . . × 2! × 1! with the convention
0!! = 1.
   Proof. This elementary lemma may be proved by induction on s using elementary
row and column transformations of the matrix. We will give here just an outline of
the proof. The basis of induction case s = 1 is trivial. To establish the inductive
step, one begins by applying elementary row operations to the matrix, the same
as in the proof of the ordinary Vandermonde determinant formula: subtract from
the last row the preceding row number s − 1 multiplied by a1 , then subtract from
row s − 1 the preceding row s − 2 multiplied by a1 , and so on. This will produce a
matrix that has 1 as the top entry of the first column, and the rest of the entries in
the first column being zeros.
   Next we expand this determinant along the first column, which will yield an
(s − 1) × (s − 1) matrix with the same determinant. Finally, applying elemen-
tary column operations, it is possible to bring this (s − 1) × (s − 1) matrix to
the form corresponding to the sequence of functions a1 an1 , 2a1 nan1 , 3a1 n2 an1 , . . . ,
(s1 −1)a1 ns1 −2 an1 , (a2 −a1 )an2 , (a2 −a1 )nan2 , . . . , (a2 −a1 )ns2 −1 an2 , (a3 −a1 )an3 , . . . ,
(am − a1 )n(sm −1) anm .
   Pulling out the factors a1 , 2a1 , 3a1 , . . . , (s1 − 1)a1 from the first s1 − 1 columns,
and (aj − a1 ) from the remaining columns, we bring the matrix to the extended
Vandermonde form of rank s − 1. To establish the inductive step, we only need to
multiply the expression for the extended Vandermonde determinant of rank s − 1
given by the induction assumption by the factors we pulled out of the columns. 
    Corollary 2.2. In the notations of the previous lemma, let a1 , . . . , am be distinct
non-zero elements of a field of characteristic greater or equal to the maximum of
s1 , . . . sm , or of characteristic 0. Then the set of exp-polynomial functions f1 (n) =
an1 , . . . , fs (n) = nsm −1 anm is linearly independent.
   Proof. From the determinant formula (2.1) we see that the vectors of values of the
functions (fj (0), fj (1), . . . , fj (s − 1)), j = 1, . . . , s, are linearly independent. 
   Corollary 2.3. Let the exp-polynomial functions f1 (n), . . . fs (n) satisfy the con-
ditions of Lemma 2.1 and Corollary 2.2. Let {ck } be a sequence with only finitely
many non-zero terms. The sequence {ck } satisfies an infinite system of linear equa-

     Proof. Since
                                                     
                            X         s
                                      X                        s
                                                               X              X
                                           dkj fj (n) ck =         fj (n)       dkj ck ,
                             k        j=1                      j=1            k

we see that (2.3) implies (2.2).
     Suppose now that (2.2) holds. Evaluating (2.2) at n = 0, . . . , s − 1, we get that
                            s
                            X               X
                                  fj (n)         dkj ck = 0 for n = 0, . . . , s − 1.            (2.4)
                            j=1              k

Now s equations of (2.4) are linear combinations of s equations of (2.3). The change
of basis matrix from (2.3) to (2.4) is an extended Vandermonde matrix and is
invertible, since by Lemma 2.1 it has a non-zero determinant. Hence, the equations
of (2.3) are linear combinations of equations of (2.4) and thus (2.3) holds. 
     The last Corollary also admits a straightforward multi-variable generalization.
   Corollary 2.4. Let f1 (n1 , . . . , nr ), . . . fs (n1 , . . . , nr ) be a set of distinct exp-
polynomial functions of the form fj (n1 , . . . , nr ) = np11 . . . npr r bn1 1 . . . bnr r , such that
exponents pi ’s are less than the characteristic of the field, in case if the field is of
finite characteristic. Let {cβ }β∈Zm be a set with only finitely many non-zero terms.
The set {cβ } satisfies an infinite system of linear equations
                                               

if and only if it satisfies a finite system

                                dβj cβ = 0 for all j = 1, . . . , s.                             (2.6)

     Now we are ready to give a proof of Theorem 1.5.
   Proof of Theorem 1.5. For the Zn -graded G(0) module V = ⊕α∈Zn Vα as defined
                                                  (0)
in Definition 1.3, we have used gi (α) to denote gi (α). We stress here that both
      (i)
{k | gk (α) 6= 0} for any fixed (i, α) ∈ Zn+1 and J in Definition 1.3 are finite sets.
The proof of the theorem will amount to proving two claims.
   Claim 1. Let us fix i1 , i2 , . . . , is ∈ N, k1 , k2 , . . . , ks , with kp ∈ K−ip , k ∈ J and
α ∈ Zn . There exist exp-polynomial functions f1 (β), . . . , fd (β) in ns variables β

                                                                    frad if and
   Proof of Claim 1. Denote the sum in (2.7) by x. We have that x ∈ M
only if
                             (j1 )              (jr )
                           gm  1
                                   (γ1 ) . . . gm r
                                                      (γr )x = 0
for all j1 , . . . , jr ∈ N with j1 + . . . + jr = i1 + . . . + is , m1 ∈ Kj1 , . . . , mr ∈ Kjr ,
γ1 , . . . , γr ∈ Zn .
    From the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt argument and the fact that the Lie algebra G
and the module V are exp-polynomial, it follows that
                                                     X     X
                (j1 )                (jr )

                                         β∈Zns       ℓ∈J


The functions hℓ are exp-polynomial in β = (β1 , . . . βs ) and γ = (γ1 , . . . , γr ), and
depend on j1 , . . . , jr ; m1 , . . . , mr . We get that x ∈ Mfrad if and only if {bβ } satisfies
the system of equations                  X       X
                                              bβ    hℓ (β, γ) = 0                           (2.8)
                                   β∈Zns      ℓ∈J

for all γ ∈ Znr , ℓ ∈ J, j1 , . . . , jr ∈ N with j1 + . . . + jr = i1 + . . . + is , m1 ∈
Kj1 , . . . , mr ∈ Kjr . Since j1 , . . . , jr ∈ N are bounded by the condition j1 +. . .+jr =
i1 + . . . + is and m1 , . . . , mr belong to finite sets, we conclude that only finitely
many functions hℓ (β, γ) appear in the system (2.8). Nonetheless the system (2.8)
has infinitely many equations because γ has an infinite range. Our goal is to reduce
(2.8) to a system with finitely many equations.
   A exp-polynomial function hℓ (β, γ) could be expanded in γ:
                                               X
                                 hℓ (β, γ) =         fp (β)aγp γ δp ,
                                                 p

where ap ∈ Cnr , δp ∈ Znr and the summation in p is finite. By Corollary 2.4, the
system (2.8) is equivalent to a finite system of linear equations:
                                        X
                                              bβ fp (β) = 0,
                                      β∈Zns


with a finite number (say, d) of exp-polynomial functions fp (β). This establishes
Claim 1.

   Proof of Claim 2. To prove this claim we need to show that any d + 1 vectors
in this set are linearly dependent. Let B be a subset in Zns of size d + 1. The
homogeneous system of d linear equations

references therein.
                MODULES WITH EXPONENTIAL HIGHEST WEIGHT                             15

   Generalized Virasoro algebras Vir[M ] in characteristic 0 were introduced by Pa-
tera and Zassenhaus in [PZ], which are Lie algebras obtained from the Virasoro
algebra by replacing the index group Z with an arbitrary nonzero subgroup M of
the base field C, which is also the 1-dimensional universal central extension of some
generalized Witt algebras [DZ]. Representations for Generalized Virasoro algebras
Vir[M ] have been studied in several references. In [SZ], all weight modules with
weight multiplicity 1 were determined, which are some so-called intermediate se-
ries modules. In [Ma], it was proved that all irreducible Harish-Chandra modules
over the generalized Virasoro algebra Vir[Q] over C are intermediate series mod-
ules (where Q is the rational number field). In [HWZ], the irreducibility of Verma
modules over the generalized Virasoro algebra Vir[M ] over C was completely deter-
mined.
   In this section we assume that M = Z⊕M0 ⊂ C where M0 is a nonzero subgroup
of C. We simply denote L = Vir[M ]/Cc. For any i ∈ Z, we denote

                                 Li = ⊕a∈M0 Cdi+a ,

                           L+ = ⊕i∈Z+ Li , L− = ⊕i<0 Li .
Then L0 ≃ Vir[M0 ]/Cc.
   For any α, β ∈ C, we have the L0 module V (α, β) = ⊕a∈M0 Cva subject to the
actions
                    da vb = (b + α + aβ)va+b , for a, b ∈ M0 .           (3.1)
We extend L0 module structure on V (α, β) to L+ +L0 module structure by defining

                                   L+ V (α, β) = 0.                               (3.2)

Then we obtain the induced L module

           Ve = Ve (α, β) = IndL
                               L+ +L0 V (α, β) = U (L) ⊗U(L+ +L0 ) V (α, β),

where U (L) is the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra L. It is clear that,
as vector spaces, Ve ≃ U (L− ) ⊗C V (α, β). The module Ve has a unique maximal
proper submodule J trivially intersecting with V (α, β). Then we obtain the quotient
module
                                V̄ = V̄ (α, β) = Ve /J.                           (3.3)
It is clear that V̄ is uniquely determined by the constants α, β, and V̄ =
⊕i∈Z+ V̄−i+α+M0 where

  V̄−i+α+M0 = ⊕a∈M0 V̄−i+α+a , V̄−i+α+a = {v ∈ V̄ | d0 v = (−i + α + a)v}. (3.4)

We can similarly define Vei+α+M0 and Ve−i+α+a . It is easy to see that

                      dim Ve−i+α+a = ∞, for i ∈ N, a ∈ M0 .
16                                    BILLIG AND ZHAO

It will be different for V̄−i+α+a .
   Note that if M0 ≃ Zn , then L is a Zn -extragraded Lie algebra, V (α, β) is a L
module with polynomial action, and V̄ (α, β) = M (V (α, β)) as defined in Sect.2. In
this case, from Theorem 1.5, we know that V̄ (α, β) has finite dimensional weight
spaces , i.e., dim V̄−i+α+a < ∞ for all i ∈ N, a ∈ M0 . More generally, we have
   Theorem 3.1 The module V̄ (α, β) defined in (3.3) over Vir[M ] has finite dimen-
sional weight spaces, more precisely, dim V̄−i+α+a ≤ (2i + 1)!! for all i ∈ N, a ∈ M0 .
   Proof. Since L− is generated by L−1 , and L+ is generated by L1 , we deduce
that
                  L−1 V̄−i+α+M0 = V̄−i−1+α+M0 , for i ∈ Z+ ,
and, if v ∈ V̄−i+α+M0 where i ∈ N, satisfies L1 v = 0 then v = 0. We also know
that, for any n ∈ N, a ∈ M0 ,

              V̄−n+α+a = span{d−1+an d−1+an−1 ...d−1+a1 va0 | ai ∈ M0 ,

                                                        with a0 + a1 + ... + an = a}.

   Claim 1. For any n ∈ Z+ , and bi ∈ C, αi ∈ M0 , (only finitely many bi are not
zero),

     Now we first consider n = 0. Suppose (3.5′ ) holds for n = 0. We have
                  X                   X

                  i∈Z                   i∈Z

which is (3.7) for n = 0. Now suppose (3.5) holds for n = 0. For any γ ∈ M0 , we
deduce             X                       X

to yield      i∈Z bi d−1+αi va0 −αi       = 0, which is (3.6) for n = 0.
   Suppose our claim holds for any n ≤ m for a fixed m ∈ Z+ . Now we consider the
claim for n = m + 1. To get (3.7) for n = m + 1, we assume (3.5′ ) for n = m + 1.
For any γ ∈ M0 , we compute
                                      X
                            d1+γ (          bi dαi d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi )

                     X
                 =         bi (−1 − γ + αi )d1+γ+αi d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi
                     i∈Z
                                X
                            +         bi dαi d1+γ d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi .             (3.8)
                                i∈Z

Since d1+γ d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi ∈ (L−1 )m va0 −αi and the coefficients are inde-
pendent of αi , by inductive hypothesis and (3.5′ ), we see that the second term on
the right hand side of (3.8) is 0. So
                                      X
                            d1+γ (          bi dαi d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi )

                     X
                 =         bi (−1 − γ + αi )d1+γ+αi d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi

      X
  =         bi (−1 − γ + αi )(−2 − γ − αi + am+1 )dγ+αi +am+1 d−1+am ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi
      i∈Z
                                    X
 +...+d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a2                  bi (−1−γ +αi )(−2−γ −αi +a1 )dγ+αi +a1 va0 −αi . (3.9)
                                    i∈Z

From inductive hypothesis and (3.5′ ), we know that each sum on the right hand
side of (3.9) is 0. Thus, for all γ ∈ M0 ,
                                   X
                          d1+γ (         bi dαi d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi ) = 0,
                                   i∈Z


which gives                  X
                                    bi dαi d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi = 0.
                             i∈Z

So (3.7) holds for n = m + 1.
18                                        BILLIG AND ZHAO

   To verify (3.6) for n = m + 1, we suppose (3.5) holds for n = m + 1. By using
(3.7) for n = m + 1, for any γ ∈ M0 we deduce that
                                X
                         d1+γ         bi d−1+αi d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi
                                i∈Z

                  X
              =         bi (−2 + αi − γ)dγ+αi d−1+am+1 ...d−1+a1 va0 −αi = 0,
                  i∈Z

which implies (3.6) for n = m + 1. Thus Claim 1 holds for n = m + 1. By inductive
principle, Claim 1 follows.
   Fix p ∈ M0 \ {0}. Let Pi = {kp|0 ≤ k ≤ 2i} for any i ∈ N. For any n ∈ N,
a ∈ M0 , α1 , ...αn ∈ Zp with αi ∈ Pi , let

       W (a, α1 , α2 , ..., αn)
                                                                        	
       = span d−1+αn+1 d−1+αn ...d−1+α1 va−α1 −α2 −...−αn+1 | αn+1 ∈ Pn+1 .

     Claim 2. For any β ∈ M0 , we have

             d−1+β d−1+an ...d−1+a1 va−α1 −...−αn −β ∈ W (a, α1 , α2 , ..., αn).

   It is clear that we can find nontrivial bαn+1 ∈ C for αn+1 ∈ Pn+1 (consider the
following as a linear system of 2n + 3 unknowns with 2n + 3 equations) such that:
                             X
                  βk +                    αkn bαn+1 = 0, for   0 ≤ k ≤ 2n + 2,
                          αn+1 ∈Pn+1


which is an equality of (3.5). Then applying (3.6), we see that Claim 2 follows.
     From Claim 2 we know that
                           n
            dim V̄−n+α+a = d−1+αn d−1+an−1 ...d−1+a1 va−α1 −α2 −...−αn :
                                      o
          αi ∈ {kp|0 ≤ k ≤ 2i} ≤ 1 · 3 · ... · (2n + 1), for n ∈ Z+ , a ∈ M0 .

Note that dim V̄α+a = 1 for all a ∈ M0 . Thus our theorem follows.               
   It is clear that V̄ (α, β) is an irreducible Vir[M ] module if and only if V (α, β)
defined by (3.4) is an irreducible Vir[M0 ] module. Thus, if we start with the irre-
ducible Vir[M0 ] module V ′ (α, β) (which is the irreducible subquotient of V (α, β)
and some of which are no longer exp-polynomial modules), instead of V (α, β), we
get an irreducible Vir[M ] module V̄ ′ (α, β), which can be also realized by taking the
irreducible subquotient of V̄ (α, β) for all α, β ∈ C.
                    MODULES WITH EXPONENTIAL HIGHEST WEIGHT                                        19

  The module V̄ (α, β) contains height weight Vir[Z] (the classical Virasoro algebra)
modules U (Vir[Z])va for any a ∈ M0 . Thus not all its weight multiplicities are 1,
which indicates the modules V̄ (α, β) are not modules of intermediate series.
   It is natural to ask the following questions:            Are Vir[Z] modules
U (Vir[Z])va irreducible ? Is it true that U (Vir[Z])va = ⊕i∈Z+ V̄i+a ? Are there
any other types of irreducible weight modules with finite dimensional weight spaces
over Vir[M ] ?
  It is important to calculate the character formula for the modules V̄ (α, β). We
know the following about dim V̄−i+α+a for i ∈ Z+ , a ∈ M0 .
      Corollary 3.2. For any i ∈ Z+ , a1 , a2 ∈ M0 , if (−i + a1 )(−i + a2 ) 6= 0, we have

                                dim V̄−i+α+a1 = dim V̄−i+α+a2 .                               (3.10)

 Proof. Suppose a1 6= a2 . Let a = a1 − a2 , G = Vir[Za] = ⊕i∈Z Cdia . Then G is
isomorphic to the classical centerless Virasoro algebra. Consider the G module W =
⊕x∈Za V̄−i+α+a2 +x . From Theorem 3.1, we know that W is a uniformly bounded G
module. By a well-known result, we see that all the dimensions of V̄−i+α+a2 +x are
equal except for V̄0 . The corollary follows. 
