                                                       let G be an algebraic torus acting diagonally on the ring of differential operators
                                                       D(Y )G . We give necessary and sufficient conditions for D(Y )G to have enough
                                                       simple finite dimensional representations, in the sense that the intersection of
                                                       the kernels of all the simple finite dimensional representations is zero. As an

                                                       group K and if zero is not a weight of a maximal torus of K on V , then D(V )K
                                                       has enough finite dimensional representations. We also construct examples of
                                                       FCR- algebras with any GK dimension ≥ 3.


                                             1        Introduction
                                             For a variety Y over k we denote the ring of regular functions on Y by O(Y ) and
                                             the ring of differential operators by D(Y ). Recently there has been much interest
                                             in the study of the invariant ring D(Y )G when G is a reductive group acting on a
                                             smooth affine variety Y , see for example [9], [12], [13], [14], [15], [17]. In this paper
                                             our primary focus is on the case where Y = V × W for a vector space V , a torus W
                                             and G is a torus acting diagonally on Y .
                                                 We say that a k-algebra R has enough finite dimensional modules ( resp. enough
                                             simple finite dimensional modules) if ∩annR M = 0 where the intersection is taken
                                             over all finite dimensional (resp. simple finite dimensional) R-modules.

    Proposition A If D(Y )G has a finite dimensional module then G acts transi-
tively on W .

    Now assume that G acts transitively on W and let H be the stabilizer in G of
w ∈ W . Note that the connected component H o of the identity in H is a torus, but
we may have H 6= H o . The slice representation at w is isomorphic to (H, V ), see
§ 3. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for D(Y )G to have enough finite
dimensional simple modules.

    Theorem B Assume that G acts transitively on W . The following conditions
are equivalent.
         o
  1. V H = 0.
              o
  2. D(V )H has enough simple finite dimensional modules.

  3. D(Y )G has a nonzero finite dimensional module.

  4. D(Y )G has enough simple finite dimensional modules.


   Set h = Lie(H) ⊆ g = Lie(G). For λ ∈ g∗ , µ ∈ h∗ we set

             Bλ (Y ) = D(Y )G /(g − λ(g)) ,       Bµ (V ) = D(V )H /(h − µ(h)).   (1)

The algebra Bλ (Y ) is studied in detail in [13]. Let i∗ : g∗ −→ h∗ be the map
obtained from the inclusion i : h −→ g.

   Proposition C

  1. There is an injective algebra homomorphism ξ : D(V )H −→ D(Y )G .

  2. If λ ∈ g∗ and µ = i∗ (λ) the above map induces an isomorphism Bµ (V ) ∼
                                                                           =
     Bλ (Y ).


    Note that any simple D(Y )G -module is a Bλ (Y )-module for some λ ∈ g∗ . So
Propositions A and C reduce the study of finite dimensional simple D(Y )G -modules
to that of finite dimensional simple D(V )H -modules. Some other situations in which
slice representations have been used to study invariant differential operators may be
found in [14] and [17].
    Now suppose that G is a maximal torus in a reductive subgroup K of GL(V ).
Then D(V )K is a subring of D(V )G , so any D(V )G -module is also a D(V )K -module.
Thus we obtain as an immediate corollary to Theorem B.

   Theorem D If 0 is not a weight of G on V then D(V )K has enough finite
dimensional modules.



                                              2
    In general it seems rather difficult to say much about finite dimensional D(V )K -
modules (or more generally primitive ideals in D(V )K ) if K o is not a torus. As far
as we are aware if K is simple the only cases where anything is known are the case
of the adjoint representation of SL(3) [15] and some representations arising from
classical invariant theory [9].
    Here is a brief outline of the paper. First we establish some notation and express
the conditions in Proposition A and Theorem B in terms of the weights of the torus
                                                                   o
action. If either the action of G on W is not transitive, or if V H 6= 0 we show that
D(Y )G contains the fixed ring of the first Weyl algebra under the action of a finite
group. If neither of these conditions hold we show that D(Y )G has enough finite
dimensional modules by first analyzing the case O(Y )G = k, and then using Fourier
transforms to reduce to this case.
    Kraft and Small [6] call an algebra R an FCR-algebra if R has enough finite
dimensional modules and every finite dimensional R-module is completely reducible.
In the last section of the paper we combine Theorem B with results from [13] to give
examples of FCR algebras with any given integer Gelfand-Kirillov dimension ≥ 3.
We denote the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of an algebra A by GK-dimA, see [8] for
background.


2     Notation
2.1   Two exact sequences
We assume that V = kr , W = (k× )s , and Y = V × W ⊆ kn , where n = r + s. A
diagonal action of a torus G on Y is an action that extends to a diagonal action on kn .
Such an action is given by an embedding of G into the group T of diagonal matrices
in GL(n). Set X(G) = Hom(G, k× ), Y(G) = Hom(k× , G) = Hom(X(G), Z), the
groups of characters and one-parameter subgroups of G, respectively. Let

                               M = Y(G), N = X(G)                                   (2)
                               A = Y(T ), B = X(T ).                                (3)

There are natural bilinear pairings

                               < , >: M × N −→ Z                                    (4)
                               ( , ) : A × B −→ Z.                                  (5)

Let φ : X(T ) −→ X(G) be the restriction map. Let K = kerφ and

                            K ⊥ = {χ ∈ Y(T )|(χ, K) = 0}.                           (6)

Then we have exact sequences

                    0 −→ K ⊥ −→ Y(T ) = A −→ Y(T )/K ⊥ −→ 0                         (7)
                                                   ′
                    0 −→ K −→ X(T ) = B −→ N −→ 0.                                  (8)



                                           3
where N ′ = Imageφ ⊆ N = X(G). Finally there is a homomorphism

                                       ω : M −→ K ⊥                                   (9)

defined by
                                 (ω(m), b) =< m, φ(b) >                              (10)
for m ∈ M , b ∈ B. A slightly different situation is described in [12].
    By introducing bases we can describe these maps using matrices. Identify G with
(k× )m and for 1 ≤ i ≤ m define νi ∈ X(G) by νi (g) = gi for g = (g1 , . . . , gm ) ∈ G.
We call {νi } the standard basis for N . Identify T with (k× )n the standard basis {ei }
for B is defined similarly, and write {νi∗ }, {e∗i } for the dual bases of M and A. For
matrix computations we identify A, B, M , N as Z-modules of column vectors using
these bases. Let It denote the t × t identity matrix. If E is an abelian group we set
EQ = E ⊗Z Q.
    For 1 ≤ i ≤ n let ηi = φ(ei ). There is an integer matrix L = (lij ) such that
                                               m
                                               X
                                        ηi =             lji νj                      (11)
                                               j=1

for i = 1, . . . , n. From (10) it follows that
                                                 n
                                                 X
                                     ω(νi∗ ) =             lij e∗j .                 (12)
                                                 j=1

Thus the maps B −→ N and M −→ A are given by multiplication by L and the
transpose of L respectively. If β = (β1 , . . . , βn ) belongs to the submodule R of Zn
spanned by the rows of L then

                              β(t) = (tβ1 , tβ2 , . . . , tβn ) ∈ T                  (13)

determines the action of a one-parameter subgroup of G on Y . We summarize this
data by saying that G acts on Y by the matrix L.
Lemma 2.1. If ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly independent there exist matrices Γ ∈ GLm (Z),
∆ ∈ GLn (Z) such that
   1. ΓL∆ has the block matrix form
                                                                      

                                                          L2 D

      where D is a diagonal matrix with nonzero diagonal entries d1 , . . . , ds .

   2. ∆ has the block matrix form
                                                                      
                                                     Ir 0
                                         ∆=                                          (15)
                                                     0 ∆1

      with ∆1 ∈ GLs (Z).

                                                 4
Proof. Let R be the submodule of Zn spanned by the rows of L, and let ǫ : Zn −→ Zs
be the projection onto the last s coordinates. Since the submatrix of L obtained by
deleting the first r columns has rank s it follows that ǫ(R) is free abelian of rank
s. Thus if R′ = kerǫ, the map R −→ R/R′ splits and there is a submodule R′′ of
R such that R = R′ ⊕ R′′ . By choosing bases for R′ and R′′ we find Γ1 ∈ GLm (Z)
such that                                        
                                          L1 0
                                 Γ1 L =             .
                                          L′2 L3
where L1 has m − s rows and r columns and the rows of [L1 , 0] form a basis for R′ .
There exist matrices Γ2 ∈ GLs (Z) and ∆1 ∈ GLs (Z) such that D = Γ2 L3 ∆1 has
the desired form, and we set
                                                         
                          Im−s 0                  Ir 0
                    Γ=               · Γ1 , ∆=                .
                            0   Γ2                 0 Γ1



     Now suppose G acts on Y via the matrix L and set

                               ΣL = {α ∈ Nr × Zs |Lα = 0}.                             (16)

If α = (α1 , . . . , αn ) ∈ Nr × Zs , we set Qα = Qα1 1 . . . Qαnn . Then O(Y )G = span{Qα ∈
O(Y )|Lα = 0} ∼      = kΣL the semigroup algebra on ΣL . If Γ, ∆ are as in the lemma
and L′ = ΓL∆, there is an isomorphism

                                           ΣL −→ ΣL′                                   (17)

given by x 7→ ∆−1 x. Thus if ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly independent we assume hence-
forth that L has the special form

where D is a diagonal matrix with nonzero diagonal entries d1 , . . . , ds .

2.2    Rings of differential operators
Note that Y is a toric variety with a dense torus T = (k× )n ⊆ Y . Write Qi for the
character ei considered as a regular function on T , and let Pi = ∂/∂Qi . Then

                         O(Y ) = k[Q1 , . . . , Qr , Q±1             ±1

     We consider the action of G on O(T ) (or O(Y )) given by right translation, that
is

[13], section 6.
    This action extends to an action of G on A = k[Q±1                       ±1
                                                                1 , . . . , Qn , P1 , . . . , Pn ]. It is
often convenient to use exponential notation for elements of A. If λ = (λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈

    If Πi = Qi Pi , then [Πi , uα ] = αi uα . Therefore D(Y ) = ⊕D(Y )α where D(Y )α =

   Each O(Y )χ is a D(Y )G -module: for a given Qλ ∈ O(Y )χ and Qµ P ν ∈ D(Y )G ,
Lλ = χ and Lµ = Lν. Hence Qµ P ν  Qλ is a multiple of Qλ+µ−ν with L(λ + µ − ν) =

2.3     Some remarks on the algebra D(V )H
                                                                  o
Note that D(V )H is the fixed ring of D(V )H under the action of the finite abelian
                           o
group H/H o . Thus D(V )H is graded by the character group of H/H o and D(V )H
is the identity component of this grading. Hence if I is any right ideal of D(V )H we
have
                                       o
                              ID(V )H ∩ D(V )H = I.                               (28)
Now fix µ ∈ h∗ and let m be the ideal of A′0 = k[Π1 , . . . , Πr ] generated by h − µ(h).
We can apply the above remarks with I = mD(V )H . It follows that there is an
embedding of algebras
                                                    o
                             D(V )H          D(V )H
                                       −→               .                            (29)
                            mD(V )H         mD(V )H o

                                                             6
                                                                                       o
From now on we denote these algebras simply by D(V )H /(h−µ(h)) and D(V )H /(h−
µ(h)). Note that by [8], Lemma 3.1 and [13], Theorem 8.2.1 we have

                                         D(V )H
                           GK − dim               ≤ 2(n − m).                              (30)
                                       (h − µ(h))
In fact it is easily seen that equality holds.


3     Actions of tori and slice representations
In this section we express the hypothesis in Proposition A and Theorem B in terms
of the weights of the action.
Lemma 3.1. Suppose the torus G = (k× )m acts on W = (k× )s with weights
ηr+1 , . . . , ηn and w = (wr+1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ W .
    1. If ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly independent then G acts transitively on W .

    2. If ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly dependent then any orbit of G on W has dimension
       less than dimW .
Proof.     1. Suppose that ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly independent and let L′ = (lji
                                                                                     ′ ) be
                                                                                 ′ =l
      the submatrix of L spanned by the last s columns ηr+1 , . . . , ηn . Thus lji    j,i+r
                                                 ′
      for 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ i ≤ s. Since L has rank s there is an integer matrix F
      and a nonzero integer d such that F L′ = dIs .
       To show that G acts transitively on W it suffices to show that given w =
       (wr+1 , . . . , wn ) ∈ W there exists g ∈ G such that g · (1, . . . , 1) = w. For
                                                                              f
       each i choose vi ∈ k× such that vid = wi and set gj = sp=1 vpp,j and g =
                                                                    Q
                                              Qm lj,i+r
       (g1 , . . . , gm ) ∈ G. Then ηi+r (g) = j=1 gj   = vid = wi as required.

    2. We can assume that G acts faithfully on W . Then ∩ni=r+1 kerηi = 1. If
       ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly dependent this implies that dimG = m < s. Any
       element w ∈ W has trivial stabilizer, so dimGw =dimG <dimW .


    Suppose that
                                     φ : G × X −→ X                                        (31)
is an action of a reductive group G on a variety X and consider a point u ∈ X with
stabilizer H = Gu and tangent space Tu (X). The differential

                                     dφ : g −→ Tu (X)                                      (32)

has kernel h = Lie(H). If H is reductive we have

                                  Tu (X) = dφ(g/h) ⊕ U                                     (33)

for some H-module U . We call the pair (H, U ) the slice representation at u, see [10],
[16].

                                             7
      Now suppose G = (k× )m a torus acting faithfully on Y = V × W with weights
η1 , . . . , ηn . Suppose that G acts transitively on W , and let w = (wr+1 , . . . , wn ) be
an element of W . Then
                                  H = Gw = ∩ni=r+1 kerηi .                               (34)
Lemma 3.2. The slice representation at w is isomorphic to (H, V ).
Proof. Assume that G acts on Y via the matrix L as in (18). Then we can identify
g with
                                 Xn
                           span{     bj Qj Pj |b ∈ R},                     (35)
                                        j=1

with R as in the proof of Lemma 2.1. The maximal ideal mw of w in O(Y ) is
generated by the Qi − wi (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where w1 = . . . = wr = 0. For a ∈ O(Y ) write
a for the image of a mod m2w . For 1 ≤ i ≤ n let Ti = Qi − wi and let {Ti∗ } be the
basis of Tw (Y ) dual to the basis {Ti }1≤i≤n of mw /m2w . The map dφ : g −→ Tw (Y )
is defined by x · a = ew (x · a) for x ∈ g and a ∈ mw where ew : O(Y ) −→ k is
the evaluation at w. An easy calculation shows that Qj Pj · Ti = δij wi , dφ maps
g to the subspace of Tw (Y ) spanned by Tr+1 ∗ , . . . , T ∗ . The linear independence of
                                                          n
ηr+1 , . . . , ηn implies that dimg/h = s, so comparing dimensions we see that dφ
induces an isomorphism of g/h onto span{Tr+1   ∗ , . . . , T ∗ }.
                                                             n

    Finally H o is the subtorus of G generated by images of one parameter subgroups
corresponding to rows of L1 . For 1 ≤ i ≤ r let ρi be the restriction of ηi to H. These
characters can be thought of as columns of L1 .
    We can easily see the following,
                    o
Lemma 3.3. V H = 0 if and only if ρi 6= 0 for all i = 1, . . . , r.


4     The special case O(Y )G = k
Lemma 4.1.          1. If O(Y )G = k then ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly independent.
    2. Assume ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly independent. Then the following conditions
       are equivalent.
       (a) O(Y )G = k.
        (b) For all χ ∈ Λ, O(Y )χ is finite dimensional.
        (c) There exists β = (β1 , . . . , βn ) ∈ K ⊥ such that βi > 0 for i = 1, . . . , r, and
            βi = 0 for i = r + 1, . . . , n.
Proof. 1. If ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are not linearly independent we can write
                                       X           X
                                           ai ηi =   bj ηj                                 (36)
                                      i∈I          j∈J

where I, J are disjoint subsets of {r + 1, . . . , n}, I 6= ∅ and the ai , bj are positive
integers. Then
                                        b
                                 Πj∈J Qjj /Πi∈I Qai i                                (37)

is a nonconstant element of O(Y )G .
    2. (a) =⇒ (c) Suppose O(Y )G = k. For 1 ≤ i ≤ r set
                               r
                               X                   s
                                                   X
                      Ci =              Q≥0 ηj +          Qηr+j ⊆ X(G)Q            (38)
                             j=1,j6=i               j=1

and
                         Ci∨ = {γ ∈ Y(G)Q | < γ, Ci >≥ 0}.                         (39)
If α ∈ K with αi ≥ 0 for i = 1, . . . r we have α = 0 since Qα ∈ O(Y )G . It follows
that −ηi ∈/ Ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Hence by equation (*) onP   page 9 of [3], there exists
γi ∈ Ci∨ such that < γi , ηi >= (ω(γi ), ei ) > 0. If γ = ri=1 γi then some integer
multiple β of ω(γ) satisfies the condition in (c).
    (c) =⇒ (b) We may assume that L has the form (18). Suppose that χ ∈ Λ and
fix ϕ ∈ Nr × Zs with Lϕ = χ. If B is identified with Zn we have

                 O(Y )χ = span{Qα|α ∈ Nr × Zs , L(α − ϕ) = 0}.                 (40)
                     ′ 
                       α
For α ∈ B write α =         with α′ ∈ Nr and α′′ ∈ Zs . Define ϕ′ and ϕ′′ similarly.
                       α′′
To show O(Y )χ is finite dimensional it suffices to show there are at most finitely
many α ∈ Nr × Zs such that
                                 L1 (α′ − ϕ′ ) = 0                             (41)


                             L2 (α′ − ϕ′ ) + D(α′′ − ϕ′′ ) = 0.                    (42)
Since D is invertible α′′ is determined once we fix α′ . (Note however that if D −1
does not have integer entries, equation (42) may impose additional conditions on
α′ ).
     Thus we may assume that r = n and L1 = L. The condition L(α − ϕ) = 0 is
equivalent to (K ⊥ , α − ϕ) = 0. Hence given β ∈ K ⊥ as in (c) we have
                                   n
                                   X                n
                                                    X
                                          βi αi =         βi ϕi                    (43)
                                    i=1             i=1

and this equation has only finitely many solutions for α ∈ Nn since all βi are positive.
   This completes the proof since obviously (b) =⇒ (a).

Remarks 4.2.    1. The first part of the Lemma can be used to give another proof
   of one implication of Lemma 3.1.

  2. If k = C and Y = V there is a more geometric proof of the equivalence of (a)
     and (c) in the Lemma. Indeed (a) says that 0 is the only closed orbit of G on
     V , while if β is a one-parameter subgroup of G as in (c) then lim β(t)v = 0 for
                                                                          t→0
      all v ∈ V . Thus the equivalence follows by the Hilbert-Mumford criterion [5],
      III 2.2.

Lemma 4.3. If O(Y )χ 6= 0, then it is a simple D(Y )G -module.
Proof. Let Qλ , Qµ ∈ O(Y )χ . Then Lλ = Lµ = χ. Hence uµ−λ ∈ D(Y )G . Set
α = µ − λ. If 1 ≤ i ≤ r, then µi ≥ 0, so from (44), (45) we get uµ−λ  Qλ = c Qµ ,
where c is a nonzero integer. Since all weight spaces of O(Y )χ are one dimensional
the result follows from this.

    Assume that O(Y )G = k. We assume the action of G on Y is defined via the
matrix L in (18). The dimensions of the modules O(Y )χ can be calculated using
the following result. To state it we require some notation. Let F be a product of
cyclic groups of order d1 , . . . , ds and R = Z[F][[t1 , . . . , tm−s ]] a ring of formal power
series over the group Z[F]. For 1 ≤ i ≤ s let tm−s+i be a generator for the cyclic
subgroup of F of order di . For χ = (χ1 , . . . , χm ) ∈ Zm set tχ = tχ1 1 tχ2 2 · · · tχmm .
Proposition 4.4. The dimensions of the modules O(Y )χ satisfy

Let LI be the matrix with columns ς1 , . . . , ςn . Then LI defines an action of a new

Lemma 5.1. If V H = 0, there is a subset I of {1, . . . , r} such that O(Y )GI = k.

Proof. Let R′ be the submodule of Zm−s spanned by the rows of L1 , and let ǫj :
RQ′ −→ Q be the restriction of the projection onto the j th coordinate. Since V H o = 0

it follows that ǫj (RQ   ′ ) 6= 0 for all j so kerǫ 6= R′ . Therefore ∪r kerǫ 6= R′ and
                                                   j    Q              j=1   j    Q
we can find β ∈ RQ        ′ such that ǫ (β) 6= 0 for j = 1, . . . , r. Now set I = {j ∈
                                           j
{1, . . . , r}|ǫj (β) < 0}. Using Lemma 4.1 it is easy to see that O(Y )GI = k.

Lemma 5.2. Let I be a subset of {1, . . . , r}. Then the map σI : A → A defined by
                                                         
                        −Pi if i ∈ I                        Qi if i ∈ I
           σI (Qi ) =                          σI (Pi ) =                      (50)
                         Qi if i ∈
                                 /I                         Pi if i ∈
                                                                    /I

i = 1, . . . , n is an isomorphism between D(Y )G and D(Y )GI .

Proof. The map σI is an isomorphism. Therefore its restriction to D(Y )G is one-to-
one. Consider the Zn -grading of D(Y )G given by (25). Since
                                     
                                       −Πi − 1 if i ∈ I
                          σI (Πi ) =                    ,
                                       Πi if i ∈
                                               /I

we can easily see that σI (A0 ) = A0 . We can also check that σI (uα ) = ±uαI with
αI = (αI1 , . . . , αIs ) where      
                                 I     −αi if i ∈ I
                                αi =                .                         (51)
                                       αi if i ∈
                                               /I
From this we conclude that σI (D(Y )α ) = D(Y )αI . Therefore σI (D(Y )G ) = D(Y )GI .


    The automorphism σI can be thought of as a partial Fourier transform [2], Chap-
ter 5. We consider the D(Y )G -module O(Y )I which equals O(Y ) as a vector space
with a new action given by
                                 a  u = σI (a)u                               (52)
for a ∈ D(Y )G , u ∈ O(Y ). Since σ(D(Y )G ) = D(Y )GI it follows from Lemma 5.2
that
                              O(Y )I = ⊕χ∈ΛI O(Y )Iχ                        (53)
where ΛI = {LI α|α ∈ Nr × Zs } and

                           O(Y )Iχ = span{Qα|LI α = χ}.                           (54)

Note in particular that
                                  O(Y )I0 = O(Y )GI .                             (55)

6     Main results
The following Lemma can be easily proved.

Lemma 6.1. Suppose R is a Zs -graded ring. There is a homomorphism

                             Φ : R −→ R[x±1           ±1
                                         1 , . . . , xs ]

defined by Φ(r) = rxα for r ∈ R(α), α ∈ Zs .

   Assume that ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly independent. Recall that G acts on Y by
the matrix L as in (18).
   Set

                               T1 = {β ∈ Zr |L1 β = 0}                           (56)
                                             n
                               T2 = {β ∈ Z |Lβ = 0}                              (57)

and

                       T1′ = {β ∈ T1 |L2 β ∈ d1 Z × . . . × ds Z}.               (58)

For β ∈ T1′ let κ(β) ∈ Zsbe the  column vector with ith entry −γi /di where γ =
                               β
L2 β ∈ Zs , and set ǫ(β) =           .
                              κ(β)
    Part of the Luna slice theorem states that there is a closed H-stable subvariety S
containing w and étale maps V //H ←− S//H −→ Y //G, [10], [16]. Taking S = V +w
we can strengthen this statement in our case as follows.

Theorem 6.2. There is an isomorphism between V //H and Y //G.

Proof. Since O(V )H = span{Qβ |L1 β = 0, β ∈ Nr ∩ T1′ } and O(Y )G = span{Qβ |β ∈
(Nr × Zs ) ∩ T2 } there is an isomorphism between O(V )H ∼= O(Y )G sending Qβ to
  ǫ(β)
Q .

6.1   Proof of Proposition C.
By [13], Theorem 8.2.1 and the remarks in Section 2.3 we have

                  GKdim(Bµ (V )) ≤ GKdim(Bλ (Y )) = 2(n − m).                    (59)

Using the notation of § 2 we have

                             R = D(V )H = ⊕α∈T1′ A′0 uα

and
                               D(Y )G = ⊕α∈T2 A0 uα .
We regard R as a Zs -graded ring with deg(A′0 uα ) = κ(α), and apply Lemma 6.1 to
obtain a homomorphism
                              R −→ R[x±1             ±1
                                        1 , . . . , xs ]                     (60)

                                           12
which is the identity on R and maps uα to uα xκ(α) . Composition with the map
specializing x±1  i  to Q±1
                         r+i for 1 ≤ i ≤ s gives the map ξ. Note that ξ(uα ) = uǫ(α) .
     Since (h − µ(h)) is in the kernel of the map from D(V )H to Bλ (Y ), ξ induces
a map ξλ : Bµ (V ) −→ Bλ (Y ). To show that ξλ is surjective it remains to show
that the imageP     of A0 in Bλ (Y ) is contained in the image of ξλ . For 1 ≤ i ≤ s we
have di Πr+i + rj=1 lm−s+i,j Πj ∈ g. Hence mod(g − λ(g)), Πr+i is in the span of
Π1 , . . . , Πr and 1. On the other hand ξ(Πi ) = Πi for 1 ≤ i ≤ r.
     Surjectivity of ξλ implies that we have equality in (59). Since Bµ (V ) is a domain
it follows from [8], Proposition 3.15 that ξλ is injective.

6.2    Proof of Proposition A
By Lemma 3.1 it suffices to show that D(Y )G has no finite dimensional modules if
ηr+1 , . . . , ηn are linearly dependent. This follows from [13], Proposition 10.1.1(1),
but we canP      give a direct proof as follows. There exist integers cr+1 , . . . , cn Q
                                                                                        not all zero
                  n
such that i=r+1 ci ηi = 0. We can assume that c = cn 6= 0. Then Q = ni=r+1 Qci i
                  Qn−1
and P = Pnc i=r+1          Q−c
                             i
                               i
                                 belong to D(Y )G
                2πi
   Let ω = e c and consider the automorphism of A1 = k[P, Q] sending P to ωP
and Q to ω −1 Q. Let F be the subgroup of Aut(A1 ) generated by this automorphism.
We have AF1 = k[P c , Qc , P Q], and it is well known that this is a simple ring, [1]. Note
that AF1 is Z-graded when we set deg(Qc ) = 1, deg(P c ) = −1, and deg(P Q) = 0.
Applying Lemma 6.1 we see that there is a ring homomorphism AF1 −→ D(Y )G
sending Qc to Q, P c to P and P Q to Pn Qn . Since AF1 is simple it follows that this
map is injective and D(Y )G has no finite dimensional modules.

6.3    Proof of Theorem B
                      o
(1) =⇒ (4) If V H = 0 then by Lemma 5.1 there exists I ⊆ {1, . . . , r} such that
O(Y )GI = k. Therefore by Lemmas 4.1 and 5.2 the faithful D(Y )G -module O(Y )I
is a direct sum of finite dimensional simple modules O(Y )Iχ . Hence D(Y )G has
enough finite dimensional simple modules.
                      o
    (3) =⇒ (1) If V H 6= 0 we claim that D(Y )G has no finite dimensional repre-
sentations. We can assume that ρ1 = 0. Then A1 ∼       = k[Q1 , P1 ] is a subalgebra of
        o
D(V )H . Hence the invariants in A1 under the action of the finite group H/H o form
a subalgebra of D(V )H . Since D(V )H is a subalgebra of D(Y )G by Proposition C
the claim follows.
    Since (4) obviously implies (3) this proves the equivalence of (1), (3), (4). The
equivalence of (1) and (2) is a special case of the equivalence of (1) and (4).


7     More on the modules O(Y )I
We give some alternative descriptions of the modules O(Y )I . First it is easy to see
that as D(Y )-modules

                  O(Y )I ∼
                                    X             X
                          = D(Y )/(     D(Y )Qi +    D(Y )Pi ).                  (61)
                                            i∈I              i∈I
                                                              /


                                                  13
                                       Q
Next for I ⊆ {1, . . . , r} set QI =       i∈I   Qi and let

                                  O(Y )I = O(Y )[Q−1
                                                  I ].                                    (62)

Note that O(Y )I is a D(Y )-module. Now let MI be the sum of all submodules of
O(Y )I of the form O(Y )J where J is a proper subset of I. Then set

                                       NI = O(Y )I /MI .                                  (63)

Proposition 7.1. As a D(Y )-module (and hence also as a D(Y )G -module) O(Y )I ∼
                                                                               =
NI .

Proof. Let nI be the image of Q−1  I  in NI . It is easy to verify that Qi · nI = 0 if
i ∈ I and Pi · nI = 0 if i ∈
                           / I. Since NI is generated by nI it follows that there is a
surjective map from O(Y )I onto NI . This map is an isomorphism since O(Y )I is a
simple D(Y )-module.


8    FCR-algebras
We give examples of Noetherian FCR-algebras of every given integer GK dimension
≥ 3. It is conjectured in [4] that FCR algebras with GK dimension 2 do not exist.
It was proved in [13], Theorem 8.2.1(4) that GK-dimD(Y )G = 2n − m.

    1. Odd GK dimension ≥ 3. Assume dimG = 1. We can take n ≥ 2. Let the
       action of G on the nth Weyl algebra An be given by the matrix:

      with bi 6= 0 for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. By [13], Proposition 10.2.1(3), these are
      algebras with the reductive property, and by Theorem B they have enough
      simple finite dimensional modules. Then GKdimAG       n = 2n − 1. In this way we
      have many examples of FCR-algebras with odd GK-dim≥ 3.
      If we take all the bi equal to 1 so that k× acts by scalar multiplication on kn
      we obtain an unpublished example of the first author and M. Van den Bergh
      which is also mentioned in [4], §3.

    2. Even GK dimension ≥ 6. Assume dimG = 2 and n ≥ 4 . Then GK-dimAG
                                                                      n =
       2n − 2. Let the action of G on An be given by the matrix:
                                                                               
                    1 0 1 0 ... 1 0                             1 0 1 0 ... 0 1
                                                       or                             .   (65)
                    0 1 0 1 ... 0 1                             0 1 0 1 ... 1 0

      In this way we get examples of FCR-algebras with even GK-dim≥ 6. By [13],
      Corollary 10.1.6 , AG
                          n has the reductive property, and by Theorem B it has
      enough simple finite dimensional modules.

      3. GK-dimension 4. Take dimG = 2, n = 3, s = 1 and r = 2. Consider the
         algebra
                           A = k[Q1 , Q2 , Q±1
                                            3 , P1 , P2 , P3 ].

        Let the action of G on A be given by the matrix
                                                 
                                          1 1 0
                                                    .
                                          0 0 1

        Then GK-dimAG = 4. By [13], Corollary 10.1.6 and Theorem B, AG is an
        FCR-algebra.
