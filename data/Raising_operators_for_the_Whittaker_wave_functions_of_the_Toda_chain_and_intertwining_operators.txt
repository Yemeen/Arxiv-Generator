                                               Intertwiners between representations of Lie groups can be used to obtain relations for matrix elements. We apply
                                            this technique to obtain different identities for the wave functions of the open Toda chain, in particular raising operators
                                            and bilinear relations for the wave functions at different energy levels. We also recall the group theory approach to
                                            the Toda chain: treating the wave functions as matrix elements in irreducible representations between the so-called
                                            Whittaker vectors, integral representations of the wave functions, etc.

                                               Interrelations between the theory of integrable systems and representation group theory proved to be fruitful for
                                            the both fields. The subject has become so vast and diverse that it looks impossible to pick up a few of surveys which
                                            would cover all the important questions. Some topics are covered in reviews [1, 2, 3] and books [4, 5]. Review [6] is
                                            closely related to our consideration. Usually it is possible to find a group theory interpretation for all the important
                                            structures of integrable systems. Phase space, symplectic structure, Hamiltonians, Lax pairs, etc. can be interpreted
                                            in terms of an underlying group symmetry for both classical and quantum integrable systems. However we will not
                                            discuss these questions here.
                                               The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how representation theory, and, more concretely, intertwining
                                            operators, can be used to obtain relations between wave-functions at different energy levels. We will work out only the
                                            simplest case of the open Toda chain with two and three particles, but the method can be applied to other integrable
                                            systems. The paper mainly follows the ideas of [7, 8].
                                               Let us recall one of the main ideas of the group theory approach to integrable systems: solutions of integrable
                                            equations usually are matrix elements or traces of the groups elements in irreducible representations. Main examples
                                            we keep in mind are: the tau-function of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili which is a matrix element in fundamental
                                            representations of the group GL∞ (see [1, 6, 8]), and the wave functions of many-body problems like Toda or Calogero-
                                            Sutherland-Moser, which are matrix elements in infinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the semisimple
                                            groups (see for example [7]).
                                               The idea to obtain different relations for wave functions is quite simple and goes as follows: let functions fi (gi ) be
                                            solutions of some integrable system corresponding to some representation Vi (Wi respectively ) of some group, (it can
                                            be the trace or matrix element, can be a wave function or a tau function, etc.) If one has an intertwinning operator
                                            V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ ... ⊗ Vn → W1 ⊗ W2 ⊗ ... ⊗ Wm then there ’usually’2 exist the following relation: D(f1 f2 ...fn ) = D̃(g1 g2 ...gm )
                                            , where D, D̃ are some differential operators. Miraculously enough this simple idea leads to non-trivial relations. It
                                            was demonstrated in [8, 9] that in such way one can obtain famous bilinear identities for KP,KdV tau-functions, which
                                            corresponds to intertwiners between fundamental representations of the GL∞ , SL(n).ˆ      In [10], it was shown, that, in
                                            this way, one can obtain the Baxter relation for transfer matrices of integrable lattice models. The above idea is also
                                            used in representation theory approach to Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation [12, 11, 5], and in the theory of special
                                            functions (see, for example [13, 14]).

                                               2 ’usually’  means that there are no such relations for generic matrix elements, while they typically emerge for solutions of integrable
                                            systems.

   In this paper, we show how to obtain different relations for the Toda wave-functions applying the above idea.
The group theory approach to the classical Toda chain has been first proposed in [15], group theory approach to
the quantum Toda chain has been proposed by Kostant and Kazhdan at late seventies (unpublished) and further
elaborated in [16], [7]. Let us recall it following [7]. Consider the group SL(n + 1, R) with the standard Chevalley
generators ei , hi , fi , and let Vλ be irreducible representations with weight λ of the principal series with weight λ. Let
us introduce the so called Whittaker vector |w >∈ Vλ , i.e. the eigenvector of generators ei . Then, one considers the
Whittaker function, i.e. matrix element Wλ (φ1 , ..., φn ) =< w|exp(φ1 h1 +φ2 h2 +...+φn hn )|w >. The main observation
is that function Wλ (φ1 , ..., φn ) is a common eigenfunction of Toda Hamiltonians, which turn out to be Casimirs of
the group SL(n + 1, R), while the weight λ marks the corresponding energy level. (Existence and other issues on
Whittaker vectors were deeply explored by Kostant [17]).
   The relations between Whittaker functions Wλ (φ) for different Vλ will be obtained as follows: let us find the
intertwinning operators Vλ1 ⊗ Vf in → Vλ2 then we will show that there exists a relations D (Wλ1 (φ1 , ..., φn )) = D̃
(Wλ2 (φ1 , ..., φn )) (see formulas 29,71) where D, D̃ are some differential operators, and Vf in is any finite-dimensional
representation of the group SL(n + 1, R). This relation is an example of the so-called raising operators [18]. This idea
was suggested to us by S. Kharchev to whom we are deeply indebted. Analogously we will construct bilinear relations
from the intertwining operators Vλ1 ⊗ Vλ2 → Vλ3 ⊗ Vλ4 . One can proceed this way toPconstruct other relations like
above, for example Vλ1 ⊗ Vλ2 = ⊕i Vλi then one can obtain relation like Wλ1 ⊗ Wλ2 = i Di (Wλi ) (see formula 39).
   Let us also note that the existence of the bilinear identities in this situation is quite surprising, because it means
that wave-function, which are the eigen-functions of Toda Hamiltonians, i.e. eigenfunctions of some linear differential
operators, satisfy some system of nonlinear differential equations. One cannot separate some finite number of wave-
functions from this system , only infinite set of them is closed nonlinear system. Nevertheless it is some system of
nonlinear equations, but we do not know its sense, its hamiltonian description (if it is) or anything else, it seems to
be interesting to clarify it.
   Let us describe what kind of technical problems arise in proceeding to the concrete formulas. Let |w >λP         1 be the
Whittaker vector in representation Vλ1 , let us consider the intertwiner Φ : Vλ1 → Vλ2 ⊗ Vf in then Φ|w >λ1 = i |w >i
⊗|i > where |i > is some basis in finite dimensional representation Vf in . to construct the explicit relations one needs
to find such polynomials Pi that |w >i = Pi (fi , hi )|w >λ2 where Pi are some polynomials of generators fi , hi , i.e. one
needs to express the components of the image of Whittaker vector in spaces Vλ1 as application of some operators to
Whittaker in space Vλ2 . This is the main technical problem we treat in this paper, we solve it for the cases SL(2, R)
and SL(3, R), but we were unable to find the general formula for the case of SL(n, R).
   Let us mention that the SL(2) Toda equation reduces to the well-known textbook equation, whose solutions are
Bessel and Mcdonald functions (depends on necessary asymptotics, we need Mcdonald one), and the relation from
theorem 2.11 one can find, for example in [19].
   Let us argue that the scheme like above can be applied to other integrable models. One knows that if instead of the
Whittaker vector |w > one considers a spherical vector |s > i.e. a vector such that it is remains fixed under the action
of the maximal compact subgroup then one can obtain wave function for Calodgero-Sutherland integrable system -
zonal spherical function, obviously if one considers different intertwiners one can obtain different relations between
wave functions. Also instead of finite-dimensional Lie group G one can takes affine group Ĝ, which corresponds to
periodic Toda chain, or quantum group Uq (G), which leads to difference equations [20, 21]. Obviously, our scheme of
obtaining different relations will work in this situations also. But of course explicit constructions of these relations
seems to be not obvious.
   We should also mention that raising operators considered here were widely explored recently [18], but all approaches
are completely different from our’s and very simple idea, that the origin of this relations is presence of the intertwining
operators, was not present in the literature to our knowledge. Let us repeat that from our point of view one can
consider all models in the same setup. Also we see that the group theory approach shows that such at first sight
not related subjects such as Baxter relation important in lattice models [10] and conformal field theory [22], raising
operators in integrable quantum many body problems [18] and bilinear relations in the theory of classical nonlinear
equations [1, 6] have the same explanations from the point of view of intertwining operators.
   Exposition is organized as follows: section 2 is devoted to the case of SL(2) and the demonstration of the main
ideas. In the section 3 we consider the case of SL(3), which is mainly analogous to the SL(2) case, but that is the
case, where first arises the problems in writing the explicit formulas for the action of the intertwining operators on
the Whittaker vectors. And we show how these problems can be solved for SL(3). Section 4 is devoted to the SL(N )
case. We recall representation theory approach to the SL(N ) Toda chain and discuss the problem of obtaining explicit
raising operators. In section 5 we make some concluding remarks.


                                                 2. SL(2) Toda Chain.
  In this section we will show how to obtain the raising operators, bilinear, etc. identities for the wave functions of
SL(2) Toda. We will do it with the help of the intertwining operators between the tensor products of representations
                                                                                                                          3


of SL(2). Before doing this in subsections 1 and 2 we will recall representation theory interpretation of the Toda wave
functions as matrix element in irreducible representation, here we closely follow [7]. Let us sketch the content: we
consider Whittaker vector |w > in irreducible representation Vλ of SL(2), i.e. such vector that it is eigenvector for
the generator e, consider Whittaker function W (φ) =< w|exp(φh)|w > , we show that it is eigenfunction for Toda
hamiltonian 12 ∂φ2 +exp(−2φ)+∂φ , the reason is that this Hamiltonian is simply the Casimir of SL(2), then we consider
intertwining operator Φ : Vλ+1 → Vλ ⊗V1 , where V1 is standard two-dimensional representation of SL(2), and the main
                                                  1 1
technical point is to show that Φ(|w >λ+1 ) = λ+1    2 (h + λ + 2)|w >λ ⊗|0 > +µR |w >λ ⊗|1 >, it is quite obvious for
the case of SL(2), because we know the representation of the Whittaker vector in terms of the action of the generator
f on the vacuum vector in module Vλ , the fact that such representation for the case of SL(N ) is unreasonable is the
main problem for writing the explicit formulas for the SL(N ) case . Then we proceed to the bilinear relations, to find
them one should find the intertwining operator between some representations: Vλ1 ⊗ Vλ2 → Vλ3 ⊗ Vλ4 . To find such
intertwiners is not an easy problem, but there is a trick which is due to [8] that works as follows: if we have intertwiners
: Vλ+1 → Vλ ⊗ V1 and Vµ+1 → Vµ ⊗ V1 we can consider their tensor product : Vλ+1 ⊗ Vµ+1 → Vλ ⊗ V1 ⊗ Vµ ⊗ V1 then
consider intertwiner: V1 ⊗V1 → C, then consider the composition: Vλ1 +1 ⊗Vµ1 +1 → Vλ1 ⊗V1 ⊗Vµ1 ⊗V1 → Vλ+1 ⊗Vµ+1 ,
hence we get desirable intertwiner (consideration instead of V1 other finite dimensional representations leads to various
kinds of necessary intertwiners).
2.1. Notations: Let us denote by (λ, n) the product (λ)(λ− 1)(λ− 2)...(λ− n+ 1), we will often use this abbreviation.
   The Lie algebra SL(2) is defined by the generators e, f, h satisfying the following relations:

                                          [e, f ] = h, [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = −2f.

   Highest weight representation:
   We consider the principal (spherical) series of representations, induced by the one-dimensional representations of
the Borel subgroup. The space of representation Vλ is functions of one real variable x and matrix elements are defined
by integrals with the flat measure. The action of the algebra is given by differential operators:
                                       ∂              ∂                 ∂
                                  e=      , h = −2x     + λ, f = −x2      + λx.                                     (3)
                                      ∂x             ∂x                ∂x
The action of the group is given by the formula:
                                            
                                        a b
                                                : xk → (a + cx)λ−k (b + dx)k                                        (4)
                                        c d
   Obviously that Constants are vacuum (i.e. the highest weight) vectors for such representation i.e. e(Constant) =
0, h(Constant) = λ(Constant)
2.2. Whittaker function. Definition 2.1: The vector |w >µλ is called Whittaker vector in representation Vλ ,
if it is eigenvector for generator e i.e. e|w >µλ = µ|w >µλ for some constant µ.
    Lemma 2.2: For given µ and irreducible representation Vλ (λ 6= 1, 2, 3, ...) there exists a unique (up to a scalar)
Whittaker vector |w >µλ ∈ Vλ , which can be expressed as follows:
                                                             X µn f n
                                         |w >µλ = exp(µx) =               |vac >                                    (5)
                                                             i=0
                                                                 n!(λ, n)
  where we denote (λ, n) = λ(λ − 1)...(λ − n + 1) and |vac > - vacuum ( the highest weight) vector in Vλ .
  The proof is obvious.

  Remark: for the case SL(2, R) Whittaker function coincides with the textbook Macdonald function (up to some
exponents and scalars), this can be easy seen from the integral representation below, see also [7].
  Proposition 2.5: The Whittaker function satisfies the equation:
                                                               
                                      1 ∂2     ∂            −2φ             1
                                          2
                                            +    − 2µR µL e       Wλ (φ) = ( λ2 + λ)Wλ (φ)                                                   (7)

    Hence, the function Ψλ (φ) = exp(φ)Wλ (φ) satisfies two particle open Toda equation:
                                                                                 
                                          1 ∂2             −2φ               1 2
                                                − 2µ  µ
                                                     R L e       Ψ λ (φ) =     λ + λ  Ψλ (φ),                                                (8)
                                          2 ∂φ2                              2

     The proof is very simple, but we will reproduce it, since it is the same for all kinds of integrable many body
problems. The main idea is that the Hamiltonian is a Casimir operators, hence it acts by scalar on every matrix
element, that’s how RHS of 7 appears, on the other hand it is some concrete operator - that’s how LHS of 7 appears.
     Proof: The Casimir operator C = 2f e + h + 12 h2 acts as scalar 21 λ2 + λ on the representation Vλ . Hence:
< w|exp(φh)C|w >= ( 21 λ2 + λ)Wλ (φ) On the other hand < w|exp(φh)C|w >=< w|exp(φh)( 12 h2 + h + 2f e)|w >=
      ∂2                                               1 ∂2
( 21 ∂φ      ∂                                                  ∂
        2 + ∂φ )Wλ (φ) + 2 < w|f exp(φ(h − 2))e|w >= ( 2 ∂φ2 + ∂φ + 2µR µl exp(−2φ))Wλ (φ) hence we obtain RHS of 7.

Q.E.D.
   Remark: any matrix element of the irreducible representation is eigenfunction if all the Casimir operators of any
group. It may seem that hence we obtain integrable system. Of course, it’s not true, because usually the dimension
of a group is something like n2 where the number of independent Casimirs is something like n. So one does not have
enough Hamiltonians in involution. So one should reduce the phase space from the hole group to some submanifold
of it, but the problem is that Casimir operator acting on the function on this submanifold can give a function
                                                                         ∂2
beyond that class. In our case we saw that < w|exp(φh)C|w >= ( 21 ∂φ            ∂
                                                                           2 + ∂φ + 2µR µl exp(−2φ))Wλ (φ).  This is
due to the clever choice: we considered matrix element of the Cartan group element between Whittaker vectors,
the idea to do so is due to Kazhdan and Kostant. For example if one takes some arbitrary vectors < u|, |v > then
                        ∂2
< u|exp(φh)C|v >= ( 12 ∂φ      ∂
                          2 + ∂φ )Wλ (φ) + 2 < u|exp(φh)f e|v >, and one can do nothing with the < u|exp(φh)f e|v >

one cannot in general express it via < u|exp(φh)|v >. So one cannot obtain the LHS of (7), despite one has RHS. The
general conception of the consistent hamiltonian reductions is due to Drinfeld and Sokolov [3].

Whittaker vector < w| is realized as x−2(λ+1) e− x . The second equality is the textbook integral formula for the
Macdonald function.

The invariant pairing is given by: < 0|0 >= 1, < 0|1 >= 0, < 1|0 >= 0, < 1|1 >= 1.
  The proof is obvious, let us only note that in order to find the intertwiners Φ−1
                                                                                 ±1 from Vλ±1 ⊗ V1 → Vλ it is more
convinient to express them via the dual intertwiners: Vλ±1 → V1∗ ⊗ Vλ , which can be easily found.

   Q.E.D.
   Remark: let us note that such simple formulas like above cannot be true for an arbitrary vector |v >λ ∈ Vλ i.e.
of course from the irredicibility of repsentations follows that there exist series O(f, h, e) such that Φ1 (|v >λ+1 ) =
O(f, h, e)|v >λ , but in general such expression will be complicated.
   Let us find the intertwiners between tensor product of infinite-dimensional representations.

Or one can rewrite it as follows. Denote by mulk operator Vλ ⊗ Vν → Vλ+ν−k which acts: f (x) ⊗ g(x) → f (x)g(x).
Then:
                                                      k
                                                    X      (−1)i (ν)k (λ)k k−i
                  Φk : f (x) ⊗ g(x) → Ck (mulk ) ∗ (                            ∂x f (x) ⊗ ∂xi g(x)).              (27)
                                                     i=0
                                                         (k − i)!i! (ν)i (λ)k−i

   The proof can be found in the literature, or proceeded as follows: from the equality: Φk ∗ h = h ∗ Φk follows
Φk (xn ⊗ xm ) = cn,m xn+m−k , using Φk ∗ e = e ∗ Φk one obtains the recurrence relation for the coefficients cn,m .
Solution of this relation can be guessed after considering several examples of small k = 0, 1, 2.
   Proposition 2.10: The action of Φk on Whittaker vectors is given by:
                                                 k
                                                X     (−1)i (ν)k (λ)k                           µ1 +µ2
                  Φk : |w >µλ1 ⊗|w >µν 2 → Ck                              (µ1 )k−i (µ2 )i )|w >λ+ν−k  .           (28)
                                                i=0
                                                    (k − i)!i! (ν)i (λ)k−i

This easily follows from 27.

2.4. Relations for the Whittaker wave functions.
   Theorem (Raising operators) 2.11 The following relations holds:
                                          ∂φ + λ + 2                        λ        −∂φ + λ
                      Wλ+1 (φ) = exp(φ)              Wλ (φ), µL Wλ−1 (φ) =    exp(φ)         Wλ (φ).               (29)
                                           2(λ + 1)                        µR           2
 Remark: easy to see that these relations are consistent: application of one then another gives that Wλ satisfy Toda
equation.
  Proof: We will calculate λ < w|⊗ < 0| Φ1 exp(φh)|w >λ+1 in two ways, first we will apply Φ1 to exp(φh)|w >λ+1
and then take pairing, hence we will obtain the RHS of (29); to obtain the LHS of (29) we will apply Φ∗1 to λ < w|⊗ < 0|
and consider the pairing after.
                                                                                                    (h+λ+2)
  λ < w|⊗ < 0| Φ1 exp(φh)|w >λ+1 = λ < w|⊗ < 0| exp(φh)Φ1 |w >λ+1 = λ < w|⊗ < 0| exp(φh)( 2(λ+1) |w >λ ⊗|0 >
                                                                                  (∂ +λ+2)
   µR
+ λ+1 |w > ⊗|1 >) = λ < w|⊗ < 0| (h+λ+2)                                           φ
                                      2(λ+1) exp(φh)|w >λ ⊗exp(φh)|0 >= exp(φ) 2(λ+1) λ < w|⊗ < 0| exp(φh)|w >λ
. Hence we get RHS of 29.
                                                          ∗
   λ < w|⊗ < 0| Φ1 exp(φh)|w >λ+1 = (λ < w|⊗ < 0|Φ1 ) |exp(φh)|w >λ+1 = λ+1 < w|exp(φh)|w >λ+1 = Wλ+1 (φ).
Hence we get the LHS of (29). Q.E.D.The proof of the second equality in (29) is the same.
   One can deduce directly from the (29) or deduce representation theoretically (as we will do for the demonstration
of the idea) the following relations:

                                            ∂φ + λ + 1                 1     λ + 1 − ∂φ
                       exp(−φ)Wλ (φ) =                    Wλ−1 (φ) +                       Wλ+1 (φ).            (30)

  Remark: analogous considerations for the infinite-dimensional algebras leads to Baxter relations for the quantum
transfer matrices in lattice models, see [10].
    Proof: We will use isomorphism Φ : Vλ+1 ⊕ Vλ−1 → Vλ ⊗ V1 and calculate the pairing < 0| < w|exp(φh)|w > |0 >
                                                                                  ∗
first directly, obtaining LHS, then applying isomorphism Φ−1 to |w > |0 > and Φ−1 to < w| < 0|, and obtain RHS.

            (µL λ−1 < w| + λ+1 < w|)exp(φh)(          |w >λ−1 +|w >λ+1 ) =

            =          λ−1 < w|exp(φh)|w >λ−1 + λ+1 < w|exp(φh)|w >λ+1 =            Wλ−1 (φ) + Wλ+1 (φ).           (31)

Q.E.D.The proof of the second relation is the same, but one should consider        λ < w|⊗ < 1|exp(φh)|1 > ⊗|w >λ
instead of λ < w|⊗ < 0|exp(φh)|0 > ⊗|w >λ . Obviously 0 = λ < w|⊗ < 0|exp(φh)|1 > ⊗|w >λ , so one cannot obtain
any more relations like above.

   The proof is the standard procedure of deducing nonlinear equations from the bilinear ones: one should substitute
φ2 = φ1 + δ and consider the Taylor expansion of the W( φ2 ) in δ and necessary relations are obtained as equalities in
different powers δ k , the above one is for k = 1. In this way one obtains Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy from the
Hirota bilinear relations.

To prove the theorem above one should note that LHS in 39 equals to λ < w| ⊗ ν < w|exp(φh)|w >λ ⊗|w >ν , on the
other hand one can compute this expression by use of isomorphism from proposition 2.9 and obtain RHS of 39. The
calculation is very similar to the one in proof of the theorem 2.12 (Baxter relation).
   So in this section we demonstrated how to deduce different relations for the Whittaker wave function of Toda by
use of intertwiners.

                                                            3. SL(3) Toda Chain.
   In this section we will show how to obtain raising operators and the bilinear identities for the wave functions
of SL(3) Toda. The idea is completely analogous to the case of SL(2): the wave functions are matrix elements
of SL(3) in irreducible representations, so considerations of the different intertwiners: Vλ ⊗ Vf inite−dim → Vλ±1 ,
Vλ1 ⊗ Vλ2 → Vν1 ⊗ Vν2 , etc. gives different relations for the wave functions. The main technical problem here is to
find the explicit expression for the image of the Whittaker vector |w >λ through the Whittaker vector |w >λ±1 : find
P (f, h), such that Φ(|w >λ ) = P (f, h)(|w >λ+1 , pay attention that we need expression of the operator P in terms
of generators of the SL(3), (expression in operators xi,j , ∂xi,j in Borel-Weil realization one can easily find). In the
case of SL(2) such problem was easily solved by the fact that there was an explicit realization of the vector |w >λ
            P      µn f n
: |w >λ = i=0 n!(λ,n)     |vac >λ , but in case of SL(3) such formula is not reasonable or useable. So one need to find
the main formula: Φ(|w >λ ) = P (f, h)(|w >λ+1 using more or less the only information about vector |w >λ that it is
eigenvector of the generators ei . So it is the main difference with the case of Sl(2) and we will mostly pay attention
to this question and we will be brief in questions analogous to the case of SL(2).
3.1. Notations: The Lie algebra SL(3) is defined by the generators e1 , e2 , e12 , h1 , h2 , f1 , f2 , f12 . Sometimes we will
refer e12 as e3 , and f12 as f3 . Generators satisfy the following relations:

   Highest weight representation:
   We consider the principal (spherical) series of representations, induced by the one-dimensional representations of
the Borel subgroup. Let us describe Borel-Weil realization. The space of representation Vλ λ = (λ1 , λ1 ) is functions of
three real variable x1 , x2 , x12 , which are matrix elements of the 3 ∗ 3 upper triangular matrices, i.e. coordinates on the
biggest Schubert cell of the SL(3) flag variety G/B. Matrix elements are defined by integrals with the flat measure.
The action of the algebra is given by the differential operators:

Vλ , if it is eigenvector for generators e1 , e2 i.e. e1 |w >λµ1 ,µ2 = µ1 |w >λµ1 ,µ2 and e2 |w >λµ1 ,µ2 = µ2 |w >λµ1 ,µ2 for some
constants µi . Obviously e3 |w >µλ1 ,µ2 = 0. We will sometimes omit indexes λ, µ, if they remains unchanged during the
calculations.
   Lemma 3.2: For given µi and the irreducible representation Vλ (λi 6= 1, 2, 3, ...) there exist a unique (up to scalar)
Whittaker vector |w >∈ Vλ , which can be expressed as follows:
                                                  |w >= exp(µ1 x1 + µ2 x2 )                                                  (56)
The proof is obvious.
   Remark: in case of sl(2) we also gave an expression for the Whittaker vector |w > in terms of the generator f , i.e.
      P       µn f n
|w >= i=0 n!(λ,n)    |vac > one can see that such expression in case of sl(3) is rather complicated and unusable.
   Lemma 3.3: The dual Whittaker vector: < w| is given by the formula:
                                                                                    x              x2
                                                                  −(λ+2) −µL   1 −µL
                                 < w| = (x12 − x1 x2 )−(λ+2) x12        e  2 x     1 x
                                                                                    12          1 x2 −x12   .                (57)
see [7].
    Definition 3.4: The Whittaker function WλµL ,µR (φ1 , φ2 ) is the function given by:
                                      WλµL ,µR (φ1 , φ2 ) =< w|exp(φ1 h1 + φ2 h2 )|w >                                       (58)
We will sometimes omit indexes λ, µ.

   Proposition 3.5: The Whittaker function satisfies the equation:
                 2                                                                               

                          +        +               +      +      − µ1 µ1 e        − µ2 µ2 e           Wλ (φ1 , φ2 ) =
                 3 ∂φ21       ∂φ22    ∂φ1 ∂φ2        ∂φ1    ∂φ2

               (2λ1 + 2λ2 + (λ21 + λ22 + λ1 λ2 )Wλ (φ1 , φ2 ).                                                        (59)
                               3
 Remark: the proof is based on idea that this hamiltonian is the second order Casimir operator for the SL(3), and
completely analogous to the SL(2) case. The function Wλ (φ1 , φ2 ) is also eigenfunction for the third order hamiltonian,
which is the image of the third order Casimir for the SL(3). So we see that Whittaker function is the wave function
for the SL(3) quantum Toda chain. These facts are standard so we are very brief.

3.3. Intertwining operators. Denote by V(1,0) the first fundamental representation of the SL(3, R), denote by |0 >
the highest weight vector, by |1 > the vector f1 |0 >, by |2 > the vector f2 f1 |0 >= f3 |0 >, i.e.:
                                                                      
                                          1                 0                0

hence e1 |0 >= 0, e2 |0 >= 0, h1 |0 >= |0 >, h2 |0 >= 0.
  Proposition 3.7: Let us denote by Φλ = Φλ,(+1,0) ⊕ Φλ,(−1,1) ⊕ Φλ,(0,−1) the ismorphism Vλ+(1,0) ⊕ Vλ+(−1,1) ⊕
Vλ+(0,−1) → Vλ ⊗ V1 . The operators Φλ,(+1,0) and Φλ,(+1,0) −1 in Borel-Weil realization are given by the formulas:
                                         Φλ,(+1,0) : xn1 1 xn2 2 xn3 3 |0 >λ ⊗|0 >→ xn1 1 xn2 2 xn3 3 |0 >λ+(1,0) ,                             (63)
                                         Φλ,(+1,0) :   xn1 1 xn2 2 xn3 3 |0   >λ ⊗|1 >→        xn1 1 +1 xn2 2 xn3 3 |0   >λ+(1,0) ,             (64)
                                         Φλ,(+1,0) :   xn1 1 xn2 2 xn3 3 |0   >λ ⊗|2 >→        xn1 1 xn2 2 xn3 3 +1 |0   >λ+(1,0) .             (65)

     xn1 1 xn2 2 xn3 3 |0 >λ+(1,0) →                         ((n1 n2 x3 + ((λ1 + 2)n3 + n2 n3 )x1 x2 )xn1 1 −1 xn2 2 −1 xn3 3 −1 |0 >λ ⊗|2 > +

                                                                                                                              (66)
    This proposition is auxillary for us. The main formulas we need to obtain the relations between the Whittaker
wave functions are the formulas from the next proposition. But to obtain them we need this statement. Actually we
use it rather small, only to fix the constants (see below).
    To prove the formula 65 one should only note that the representation V(1,0) also have Borel-Weil realization and
the above intertwiner is given by the multiplication of functions from the two representations. The proof of the
formula 66 is more complicated, but it is standard representation theory reasoning, and should be available in the
literature, but we were not able to find it. So we sketch the proof. Let us denote the three components of the operator
            −1                                          −1
(Φλ,(+1,0) )   by Ψ0 , Ψ1 , Ψ2 , i.e. (Φλ,(+1,0) ) |v >= Ψ0 (|v >) ⊗ |0 > +Ψ1 (|v >) ⊗ |1 > +Ψ2 (|v >) ⊗ |2 >, first
simple, but useful step in proving 66 is that all the three operators Ψi can be easily expressed one throw another,
so it’s enough to find only one of them. Actually it is easy to see that, for example: Ψ1 = [Ψ2 , f2 ], Ψ0 = [Ψ2 , f3 ].
Looking at the formula 66 it is clear that operator Ψ2 is much simpler than the other two, so it is rather useful
that we can express them through the operator Ψ2 . Second step is to find Ψ2 . It goes as follows, first let us
note that: Ψ2 (xk11 xk22 xk33 ) = αk1 ,k2 ,k3 xk11 −1 xk22 −1 xk33 + βk1 ,k2 ,k3 xk11 xk22 xk33 −1 . That easily follows from the equalities:
Ψ2 h1 = h1 Ψ2 , Ψ2 h2 = h1 Ψ2 and ek11 +1 Ψ2 (xk11 xk22 xk33 ) = 0, e3k1 +1 Ψ2 (xk11 xk22 xk33 ) = 0. the second point is to use the
commutation relation of e2 and Ψ2 and to find recurrence relations for αk1 ,k2 ,k3 , βk1 ,k2 ,k3 , they can be solved directly
after some work. Hence we find Ψ2 and as explained above it follows that we find Φ1 , Φ0 .
    Remark: Some other useful formulas for the intertwiners we put to the Appendix. Let us note that it is rather easy
to find the formulas for the intertwiners in Verma realization (see Appendix), not Borel-Weil, but the problem is that
expression of the vector xk11 xk22 xk33 through the vectors f1n1 f2n2 f3n3 is rather complicated and untreatable.

   This proposition is crucial in this section. The relations for the Whittaker wave functions (71,72) easily follows
from it. Let us sketch the proof and explain the difference with SL(2) case, which is much more simple. We discuss
the analogous reasonings with more details in the next section in the case of SL(n). Let us denote by P0 , P1 , P2 the
operators such that: (P hiλ,(+1,0) )−1 |w >λ+1 = Ψ0 |w >λ ⊗|0 > +Ψ1 |w >λ ⊗|1 > +Ψ2 |w >λ ⊗|2 > . We will look for
them as some polynomials Pi (hi , fi ) from the generators ei . From the commutation relations with the operators ei
and uniqueness of the Whittaker vector it’s easy to see that the operator P2 is some constant depending only on µi .
To fix this constant we look on the formulas 66, 56 and see that P2 = µ1 µ2 . Also from the commutation relations with
operators ei follows the following relations: [P1 , e1 ] = 0, [P1 , e2 ] = e2 + Constant so A1 equals µ12 Λ2 + C1 , where Λi
are fundamental coroots, i.e. elements of Cartan subalgebra such that [Λi , ej ] = δi,j , the constant C1 can also be fixed
by the formulas 66,56. Analogously A0 satisfy the identities: [P0 , e2 ] = 0, [P0 , e1 ] = µα1 A1 e1 + βP1 , where α + β = 1.
the solution of this equation is given by the ansatz P0 = µ12 (f1 + µ11 (Λ21 + C0 Λ1 )) the constants c0 , α, β also can be
fixed by the formulas 66,56. So the necessary formulas for Pi are obtained.
   Let us one more time emphasize the difference with the SL(2) case, where we had the formula for the Whittaker
               P      µn f n
vector |w >= i=0 n!(λ,n)     |vac >. Hence the proposition 2.8, which is analogous to the proposition 3.8 above immedi-
ately follows from the formula for the action of the intertwiner on the vector f n |vac >. In the present case the formula
for |w > in terms of the generators fi is too complicated to extract something from it, so the proof of the proposition
above was based mostly on the property of the Whittaker vector: ei |w >= µi |w >.

  This proposition follows from the 67,70 in a way completely analogous to the SL(2) case (proposition 2.11), so we
omit the details.

  The prooof is also completely analogous to the SL(2) case, so we refer the reader to the previous section.
  One can obtain the nonlinear equations from this bilinear one, as it was done in the SL(2) case, but we omit these
considerations due to their length.

                                                                               ij hi hj ,                                    (75)

where the first sum goes over all (positive and negative) roots.
   In the case of generic SL(N ) group, one can define the (right) regular representation only in general terms of the
group acting on the space of the algebra of functions:
                                                       πreg (h)f (g) = f (gh).                                               (76)
Therefore, we use from now on mostly group (not algebra) terms. Still, we can restrict the space of functions to
the irreducible representations in the generic situation. For doing this, we consider the representation denoted by Vλ
induced by one-dimensional representations of the Borel subgroup. That is, we reduce the space of all functions to
the functions satisfying the following covariance property:
                                                       fλ (bg) = χλ (b)fλ (g),                                               (77)
12


where b is an element of the Borel subgroup of lower-triangle matrices and χλ is the character of the Borel subgroup
of the form:
                                               N
                                               Y −1
                                      χλ (b) =      | bii |(λ−ρ)e i (signbii )ǫi ,                               (78)
                                                        i=1

where ǫi are equal to either 0 or 1. For the sake of simplicity, we consider the representations with all these sign factors
to be zero although other cases can be also easily treated. The representation constructed belongs to the principal
(spherical) series.
   Thus, our representation is given by restricting the space of functions to the functions defined on the coset B\G,
the biggest cell of which, in turn, may be identified with the strictly upper-triangular matrices N+ . We will denote by
xi,j the matrix elements of n ∗ n matrices, and discussion above gives us realization of the representation of the SL(n)
in the space of functions of xi,j , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. The explicit formulas can be found for example in [23, 24].

4.2. Whittaker function. Definition 4.1: The vector |w >µλ1 ,...,µn−1 is called Whittaker vector in represen-
tation Vλ , if it is eigenvector for generators e1 , ..., en−1 i.e. ei |w >λ = µi |w >λ for some constants µi . Obviously
[ei , ej ]|w >λµ1 ,µ2 = 0. We will sometimes omit indexes λ, µ, if they remains unchanged during the calculations.
    Lemma 4.2: For given µi and irreducible representation Vλ there exist a unique (up to scalar) Whittaker vector
|w >∈ Vλ , which can be expressed as follows:
                                        |w >= exp(µ1 x1,2 + µ2 x2,3 + ... + µn−1 xn−1,n )                                        (79)
   The proof is obvious due to explicit formulas for generators ei in Borel-Weil realization. ei acts on such vector as
∂xi,i+1 , see [7] for details.

     Definition 4.3: The Whittaker function Wλ i             j
                                                                 (φ1 , φ2 , ..., φn−1 ) is the function given by:
                               µL   R
                                i ,µj
                            Wλ          (φ1 , φ2 ) =< w|exp(φ1 h1 + φ2 h2 + ... + φn−1 hn−1 )|w >                                (80)
We will sometimes omit indexes λ, µ.
  Proposition 4.4: The Whittaker function satisfies the equation:
                                                                 
         X                  X             X           X              µL ,µR                   µL ,µR
          A−1
             ij ∂φi ∂φj + 2
                               −1
                              Aij ∂φj − 2   µL  R
                                             i µi exp(   Ai,j φj ) Wλ i j (φi ) = (λ2 − ρ2 )Wλ i j (φi ).                       (81)
           ij                    ij                 i                  j

where ρ is one half of sum of simple roots.
   Remark: the proof is based on the idea, that this hamiltonian is the second order Casimir operator for the SL(n), and
completely analogous to the SL(2) case. The function Wλ (φi ) is also eigenfunction for the higher order hamiltonians,
which are the images of the higher order Casimirs for the SL(n). Hence, we see that Toda is completely integrable
system and the Whittaker function is the wave function for all Hamiltonians of the SL(n) quantum Toda chain. These
facts are standard so we are very brief (see [7]).

   The theorem is corollary of the facts that the invariant pairing < v|u > is realized as integral with the flat measure,
and the realizations of the Whittaker and the dual Whittaker vectors. The most nontrivial part is to find dual
Whittaker vector. We refer to [7] for detailed exposition.

4.3. Intertwining operators. Denote by V(1,0,...,0) the first fundamental representation of the SL(n, R), which is
just the standard action of the n ∗ n matrices on Cn , denote by |0 > the highest weight vector, by |1 > the vector
f1 |0 >, by |2 > the vector f2 f1 |0 >= f3 |0 >, etc.
    To construct relations for wave functions, one needs to express the action of the intertwiner on Whittaker vector,
in terms of the generators fi , hi . For example the crucial formula for us in the case of SL(3) was:

                                                                 1

   We need analogous formulas for the case of SL(n). We are unable to find them. We will present only the equations
solutions to which will give necessary formulas and first steps towards their solution.
   Let us consider the most simple intertwiner Φ : Vλ+(1,0,...,0) → Vλ ⊗ V(1,0,...,0) . We need to find such polynomials
Pj (fi , hi ), 0 ≤ j < n such that:
                                                            n−1
                                                            X
                                     Φ|w >λ+(1,0,...,0) =         Pj (fi , hi )|w >λ ⊗|j >                                (85)
                                                            j=0

  Proposition 4.6 The following relations holds :
                            ek Pj (fi , hi )|w >λ +δj,k−1 Pk (fi , hi )|w >λ = µk Pj (fi , hi )|w >λ                      (86)
The proof is obvious.
  Corollary 4.7: One can look for Pj (fi , hi ) as an elements of the U (sl(n)), satisfying the following relations:
                                                                      [ek , Pj (fi , hi )] = 0, for k 6= j + 2            (87)
                     [ek , Pk−2 (fi , hi )] = αk Pk−1 (fi , hi )ek + βk Pk−1 (fi , hi ), where αk + βk = 1.               (88)
   This allows one to organize itterative search of polynomials Pj : if Pj already found then Pj−1 is defined by
conditions: [ek , Pj−1 (fi , hi )] = 0 for k 6= j + 1 and [ej+1 , Pj−1 (fi , hi )] = αk Pk−1 (fi , hi )ek + βk Pk−1 (fi , hi ).
   We can conclude from the considered examples that the highest degree part of the Pj−1 can be defined uniquely
from this relations. The problem is that we do not know the way of solving such reccurence relations. Let us present
the first 3 polynomials Pj found by hands.
   Proposition 4.8: Polynomials Pn−1 , Pn−2 , Pn−3 are given by the formulas:
                      Pn−1 = µ1 µ2 ...µn−1 , Pn−2 = (Λn−1 + Constant)µ1 µ2 ...µn−2 ,                                      (89)
                      Pn−3 = (µn−2 fn−2 + µn−3 fn−3 + .... + µ1 f1 +
                      +(Λ2n−2 − Λn−2 Λn−3 ) + (Λ2n−3 − Λn−3 Λn−4 ) + ... + (Λ1 )2 )µ1 µ2 ...µn−3 + F1 (Λi ).              (90)
where Λi - fundamental coweights, F1 - some polynomial of degree 1.
   The proof is straightforward check that given polynomials satisfy relations (87) and one can see that they are the
only with this property.
   So we see polynomials Pn−1−j are of degree j. It’s easy to guess that it also holds true for j > 3. It’s easy to
understand that to write the simplest raising relation one should find P0 , which should be some polynomial of degree
n − 1. Our first hope to do that was to find some recurrence formula: Pj−1 = Aj Pj , but we did not succeed, looking
at 90 it seems that such formula may not exist. Another idea is that may be Pj are somehow related to the Casimirs
of subalgebras SL(n − j), which one guess looking at 90 and to commutation relation: [ek , Pj ] = 0 for k 6= j + 2.
   Let us also note that it is possible to write intertwiner Vλ+(1,0,...,0) → Vλ ⊗ V(1,0,...,0) in Borel-Weil realization so it
is possible to find the expression for Pj as some polynomial of operators of multiplication on monomials xi,j but the
problem is then express such operators via the polynomial of the fi , hi .

                                                  5. Concluding remarks.
   Let us formulate the main points of our work. First, we recalled the representation theory approach to integrable
systems, i.e. we recalled that appropriate matrix elements in irreducible representations are the wave functions
of integrable systems, Casimirs of the group are the Hamiltonians, the integral representation can be obtained by
realizing the representation of the group in space of functions, where the pairing is given by the integral. Second, we
demonstrated in our paper that different relations between the wave functions, can be obtained from considerations
of intertwining operators between above representations. We saw that raising, bilinear etc. relations can be obtained
this way.
   In this paper we did not succeed in obtaining the general formula for the case of SL(n), it seems such formula can
be quite complicated. We only found some recurrence relations, whose solution leads to desired formula. It seems that
one should guess some ansatz for the desired polynomial, something like determinant or trace of some matrix of the
generators of the algebra, like the formula for Casimirs.
   Group theory approach to integrable systems is very powerful, it allows to give transparent explanations for different
properties of the system. So let us mention some questions about integrable systems which should be interpreted by
the group theory methods. It will be interesting to understand the relation between our approach to raising relations
and approach based on Hecke algebra (see [18]). It is well-known that Bessel functions, which are very close to the
SL(2)
   P∞Toda wave nfunctions,1 satisfy1 the following properties: n
      n=−∞ Jn (x)t = exp( 2 x(t − t )) and hence J−n (x) = (−1) Jn (x).
   It will be interesting to find analogues formulas for the wave functions of SL(n) Toda chain and find their group
theory interpretation. In the studding integrable systems recently appeared such new important ideas as shift operator
and Dunkl operator [25], another new important concept is Cherednik-Matsuo correspondence (see Cherednik in [2])
14


between solutions of integrable systems and solutions of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation it seems to be interesting
to understand their group theory meaning.
   Let us note the most straight-forward generalization of relations obtained here is their transfer to the other groups:
                                                              ˆ
instead of SL(2, R) we plan to consider the affine version SL(2)    related to periodic Toda chain, quantum analogue
Uq (SL(2)) related to Mcdonald polynomilas and q-special functions, and may be finite field analog SL(2, Fq ), which
may be related to the questions considered in [26].

       Φλ,(0,−1) : f1n1 f2n2 f3n3 |0 >λ+(0,−1) → (f1n1 +1 f2n2 +1 f3n3 + (λ2 − n2 )f1n1 f2n2 f3 3      |0 >λ ⊗|0 > +
       (n1 (λ2 −   n2 )f1n1 −1 f2n2 f3n3 +1+ (n1 − (λ1 + λ2 + 1))f1n1 f2n2 +1 f3n3 )|0 >λ ⊗|1 > +

     Proposition : In Borel-Weil realization the action of the intertwiner on the Whittaker vector can be written as
follows:
                                                                      1
