                                                                                Introduction
                                                Our aim in this series of papers is to develop a theory of character sheaves on
                                             a not necessarily connected reductive algebraic group G. In the case of connected
                                             groups such a theory appeared in [L2], [L3]. An extension to disconnected groups
                                             has been sketched in [L4] without proofs; here we try to give a fuller and more
                                             precise treatment and to supply the proofs that were missing in [L4]. The main
                                             object of the theory, the character sheaves of G, are certain simple perverse sheaves
                                             on G, equivariant with respect to the conjugation action of the identity component
                                             of G. At least for connected G (over a finite field) the character sheaves are
                                             intimately related with the characters of irreducible representations of the group
                                             of rational points of G and such a relationship is also expected in the disconnected
                                             case. The theory of character sheaves on G is also crucial for the classification
                                             of ”unipotent representations” of simple p-adic groups [L5] and here one is forced
                                             to allow G to be disconnected if one wants to include p-adic groups that are not
                                             inner forms of split groups.
                                                The present paper tries to extend parts of [L2,§1-§4] from the connected case to
                                             the general case. We develop enough background so that we are able to define (see
                                             6.7) the notion of ”admissible complex” on G, one of the two incarnations of the
                                             character sheaves of G. One of the themes of this paper is the construction of a de-
                                             composition of G into finitely many strata (generalizing a construction in [L2, 3.1]),
                                             see §3. Each stratum is a locally closed, irreducible, smooth subvariety of G. Each
                                             stratum is a union of G0 -conjugacy classes of fixed dimension; more precisely, the
                                             centralizers of two points in the same stratum have G0 -conjugate identity compo-
                                             nents. Also, the closure of any stratum is a union of strata. Each stratum carries
                                             some natural local systems which extend to intersection cohomology complexes
                                             on the closure, which we also describe by a direct image construction, using the
                                             dimension estimates in §4.
                                                I wish to thank F. Digne and J. Michel for some useful comments on [L4].

                      1. Preliminaries on reductive groups
1.1. We fix an algebraically closed field k. All algebraic variety are assumed to
be over k. All algebraic groups are assumed to be affine.
   We shall use the following notation. If H is a group, the centre of H is denoted
by ZH ; if H ′ is a subgroup of H, let NH (H ′ ) = {h ∈ H; hH ′ h−1 = H ′ }. If in
addition H ′′ is a subgroup of H, let ZH ′ (H ′′ ) = {h′ ∈ H ′ ; h′ h′′ = h′′ h′ ∀h′′ ∈
H ′′ }; if h ∈ H, let ZH ′ (h) = {h′ ∈ H ′ ; h′ h = hh′ }. If H is an algebraic group, we
denote by H 0 the identity component of H and we set Hss = H/ZH             0
                                                                              0 ; for h ∈ H

we denote by hs (resp. hu ) the semisimple (resp. unipotent) part of h, so that
h = hs hu = hu hs . If X is a subset of H we set Xs = {hs ; h ∈ X}. The unipotent
radical of H (assumed to be connected) is denoted by UH .
   We fix an algebraic group G such that G0 is reductive. (We then say that G is
reductive.) Let g = Lie G.
1.2. Let T be a torus and let f : T −→ T be an automorphism of finite order with
fixed point set T f .We show that
   (a) the homomorphism (T f )0 × T − → T, (t, x) 7→ xtf (x)−1 is surjective.
This can be reduced to an analogous statement about a finite dimensional Q-
vector space V and a linear map φ : V −    → V of finite order: the linear map
Ker(φ − 1) × V − → V, (w, v) 7→ w + v − φ(v) is surjective.
1.3. Let g ∈ G. We show that
                                  0            0   0       0                    −1 −1
   (a) the homomorphism (ZG         0 ∩ ZG (g)) × ZG0 −
                                                      → ZG   0 , (t, x) 7→ xtgx   g   is
surjective.
            0       0                                                       0
Ad(g) : ZG    0 −
                → ZG  0 is of finite order since some power of g is in G . Therefore

(a) is a special case of 1.2(a).
1.4. Let g ∈ G. Then g normalizes some Borel of G0 , see [St, 7.2]. Following
[St, 9], we say that g is quasi-semisimple if there exist a Borel B of G0 and a
maximal torus T of B such that gBg −1 = B, gT g −1 = T . If g is semisimple then
it is quasi-semisimple, see [St, 7.5, 7.6]. More generally, by an argument similar
to that in [St, 7.6], we see that
    (a) if g is semisimple and P is a parabolic of G0 such that gP g −1 = P then
there exists a Levi L of P such that gLg −1 = L.
Here are some further results.

   (b) If g is semisimple or, more generally, quasi-semisimple then ZG (g) is re-
ductive. See [Sp, 1.17, 2.21].
   (c) g is quasi-semisimple if and only if gu is quasi-semisimple in the reductive
group ZG (gs ). See [Sp, 2.22].
   (d) If g is quasi-semisimple and T1 is a maximal torus of ZG (g)0 then there
is a unique maximal torus T of G0 such that T1 ⊂ T . See [Sp, 1.15]. (We have
necessarily T = ZG0 (T1 ), T1 = (T ∩ ZG (g))0 .)
   (e) g is quasi-semisimple if and only if the G0 -conjugacy class of g is closed in
G. See [Sp, 1.15].
1.5. Assume that s ∈ G is semisimple. Let T1 be a maximal torus of ZG (s)0 .
Clearly, some power of s is in ZZG (s)0 hence in T1 (since ZG (s)0 is reductive). Thus,
the subgroup hsiT1 generated by s and T1 is a closed diagonalizable subgroup of
G with identity component T1 . For any character α : hsiT1 −      → k∗ let gα = {x ∈
g; Ad(a)x = α(a)x ∀a ∈ hsiT1 }. Then g = ⊕α gα . Let R be the set of all α such
that α 6= 1, gα 6= 0. For α ∈ R we have necessarily dim ga = 1. (Compare [L5,
6.18].) We have g1 = Lie T where T = ZG0 (T1 ).
1.6. Let Ē(G0 ) be the set of all pairs (B, T ) where B is a Borel of G0 and T is a
maximal torus of B. The group Aut(G0 ) of automorphisms of G0 acts naturally on
Ē(G0 ). It is known that to G0 one can associate canonically an algebraic variety
E(G0 ) whose points are called ”épinglages” with the following properties.
   (i) There is a natural action of Aut(G0 ) on E(G0 ) which restricts to a free
transitive action of the group of inner automorphisms of G0 on E(G0 ).
   (ii) There is a natural Aut(G0 )-equivariant map p : E(G0 ) −→ Ē(G0 ).
1.7. Let g ∈ G. Assume that Ad(g)e = e where e ∈ E(G0 ). Let (B, T ) = p(e).
Then gBg −1 = B, gT g −1 = T hence g is quasi-semisimple. In particular, ZG (g) is
reductive. The following results are known.
   (a) ZB (g)0 is a Borel of ZG (g)0 .
   (b) ZZ0 G (g)0 = (ZG0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ;
   (c) P 7→ ZP (g)0 is a bijection between the set of parabolics of G0 that contain B
and are normalized by g and the set of parabolics of ZG (g)0 that contain ZB (g)0 ;
moreover, if L is a Levi of P then ZL (g)0 is a Levi of ZP (g)0 .
1.8. Assume that u ∈ G is unipotent and (B, T ) ∈ Ē(G0 ) is such that uBu−1 =
B, uT u−1 = T . We show that
   (a) there exists e ∈ E(G0 ) such that p(e) = (B, T ), Ad(u)e = e.
Let E ′ = {e ∈ E(G0 ); p(e) = (B, T )}. Then T acts transitively on E ′ . Moreover,
Ad(u)E ′ = E ′ . Hence the subgroup huiT generated by u and T acts on E ′ .
Since u ∈ NG T and (NG T )0 = T , some power of u belongs to T . Hence huiT
is a closed subgroup of G with identity component T . Let e0 ∈ E ′ . We have
Ad(u)e0 = Ad(t−1 )e0 for some t ∈ T . Thus, tu belongs to the stabilizer of e0
in huiT , a closed subgroup of huiT . Then the unipotent part (tu)u also belongs
to this stabilizer that is, Ad((tu)u )e0 = e0 . The image of (tu)s in the unipotent
4                                     G. LUSZTIG

group (huiT )/T must be 1. Hence (tu)u has the same image as tu or as u. Thus,
(tu)u = t′ u where t′ ∈ T and we have Ad(t′ u)e0 = e0 with t′ u unipotent. By
1.2(a) with f : T −  → T, f (x) = uxu−1 (of finite order), we have t′ = t2 t1 ut−1 1 u
                                                                                       −1

for some t1 , t2 ∈ T with ut2 = t2 u. Then t′ u = t2 t1 ut−1
                                                          1 . Since t2 is semisimple and
it commutes with t1 ut1 which is unipotent, we see that t1 ut−1
                         −1
                                                                      1   = (t′ u)u = t′ u
                          −1                   −1
we see that t′ u = t1 ut1 . Thus Ad(t1 ut1 )e0 = e0 hence Ad(u)e = e where
e = Ad(t1 )−1 e0 . This proves (a).
1.9. Let D be a connected component of G which contains some unipotent element
of G. Then
   (a) D contains a unique closed unipotent G0 -conjugacy class; this is the set of
unipotent, quasi-semisimple elements in D. See [Sp, 2.21].
1.10. Let P be a parabolic of G0 and let L be a Levi of P . Let g ∈ NG L∩ ∈ NG P .
We show that
    (a) ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ) = L.
Let L′ = ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ). Then L′ is a reductive, connected subgroup of G0
and L ⊂ L′ . Moreover, P ∩ L′ is a parabolic subgroup of L′ with Levi L. We
have gL′ g −1 = L′ , g(P ∩ L′ )g −1 = P ∩ L′ . If (a) is true for NG L′ , P ∩ L′ , L, g
instead of G, L, P, g, then we would have ZL′ ((ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ) = L. Hence L′ = L.
Thus, to prove (a), we may assume that L′ = G0 and we must show that L = G0 .
Replacing g by a left L-translate, we may assume that there exists (B1 , T ) ∈ Ē(L)
such that gB1 g −1 = B1 , gT g −1 = T . Since g normalizes UP , it also normalizes
the Borel B = B1 UP of G0 . Let e ∈ E(G0 ) be such that p(e) = (B, T ). Then
p(Ad(g)e) = (B, T ). We can find g0 ∈ G0 such that Ad(g)e = Ad(g0 )e hence
(B, T ) = (g0 Bg0−1 , g0 T g0−1 ) and g0 ∈ T , Ad(g0−1 g)e = e. Replacing g by g0−1 g
we may assume in addition that Ad(g)e = e. Then automatically Ad(g) fixes an
épinglage of L which lies over (B1 , T ) ∈ Ē(L). By 1.7(b) for (g, G) and (g, L), we
have
               (ZG0 ∩ ZG (g))0 = ZZ0 0 (g)0 , (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 = ZZ0 L (g)0 .
                                       G


Since L′ = G0 , we have (ZL ∩ZL (g))0 ⊂ (ZG0 ∩ZG (g))0 , hence ZZ0 L (g)0 ⊂ ZZ0 0 (g)0 .
                                                                               G
Since ZL (g)0 is a Levi of a parabolic of ZG0 (g)0 (see 1.7(c)), we have ZL (g)0 =
ZZG0 (g)0 (ZZ0 L (g)0 ) hence ZL (g)0 = ZG0 (g)0 . It follows that ZP (g)0 = ZG0 (g)0 .
Using 1.7(c) we deduce that P = G0 hence L = G0 . This proves (a).
1.11. Let P be a parabolic of G0 . Let s ∈ NG P be semisimple. Then
   (a) UP ∩ ZG (s) is connected.
Since s normalizes UP , this follows from [B, 9.3].
1.12. Let P be a parabolic of G0 . Let s ∈ NG P be semisimple. Choose a Levi L
of P such that s ∈ NG L. (See 1.4(a).) Let Q = ZG (s)0 ∩ P . We show:
   (a) Q is a parabolic of ZG (s)0 with Levi ZL (s)0 and UQ = UP ∩ ZG (s);
   (b) ZL (s)0 and ZG (s)0 have a common maximal torus and ZZG (s)0 ⊂ ZZL (s)0 .
We prove (a). By 1.4(b) (for G or for NG L), ZG (s) and ZNG L (s) are reductive.
              CHARACTER SHEAVES ON DISCONNECTED GROUPS, I                            5

Since ZG (s)0 /Q is a closed subvariety of the projective variety G/P , it is itself
a projective variety. Hence Q is a parabolic of ZG (s)0 . Now UP ∩ ZG (s) =
UP ∩ ZG (s)0 (see 1.11) is a normal unipotent subgroup of Q hence it is contained
in UQ . Since L has finite index in NG L, ZL (s) has finite index in ZNG L (s) hence
ZL (s) is reductive. Let y ∈ Q. Then y ∈ P hence we can write uniquely y =
xu where x ∈ L, u ∈ UP . Since sys−1 = y we have y = (sxs−1 )(sus−1 ) and
sxs−1 ∈ L, sus−1 ∈ UP . By uniqueness we have sxs−1 = x, sus−1 = u. Thus,
x ∈ ZL (s), u ∈ UP ∩ ZG (s). The map y 7→ x is a morphism of algebraic groups
f :Q−  → ZL (s). Since Q is connected, f (Q) is contained in ZL (s)0 . We see that
Q = ZL (s)0 (UP ∩ ZG (s)). Clearly, ZL (s)0 ∩ (UP ∩ ZG (s)) = {1}. Since ZL (s)0 is
reductive and UP ∩ ZG (s) ⊂ UQ , it follows that (a) holds.
   We prove (b). Let T1 be a maximal torus of ZL (s)0 . Let T2 be a maximal
torus of ZG (s)0 containg T1 . By 1.4(d) (for NG L instead of G), T̃ := ZL (T1 ) is
a maximal torus of L. By 1.4(d) (for G), T := ZG0 (T2 ) is a maximal torus of
G0 . Now (ZL ∩ ZL (s))0 is contained in ZZL (s)0 hence is contained in T1 . Hence
ZG0 (T1 ) ⊂ ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZL (s))0 ) = L where the last equality comes from 1.10(a).
Since T ⊂ ZG0 (T1 ), it follows that T ⊂ L and since T1 ⊂ T and T is commutative,
we have T ⊂ ZL (T1 ) = T̃ . Since T̃ , T are maximal tori of G0 , we must have T̃ = T .
By 1.4(d) we have T1 = ZT̃ (s)0 , T2 = ZT (s)0 . It follows that T1 = T2 . This proves
the first assertion of (b). Since ZG (s)0 is reductive, its centre is contained in any
maximal torus of ZG (s)0 , in particular in T2 . Since T1 = T2 and T1 ⊂ ZL (s)0 , we
see that ZZG (s)0 ⊂ ZL (s)0 and (b) follows.

1.13. Let P be a parabolic of G0 . Let s ∈ NG P be semisimple. Assume that
ZG (s)0 ⊂ P . We show:
   (a) there is a unique Levi L of P such that ZG (s)0 ⊂ L. We have s ∈ NG L.
Let T0 be a maximal torus of ZG (s)0 . Let T be a maximal torus of P containing T0 .
By 1.4(d), ZG0 (T0 ) is a maximal torus of G0 . It contains T hence it is equal to T .
Clearly, ZG0 (T0 ) is normalized by s; hence sT s−1 = T . Let L be the unique Levi
of P such that T ⊂ L. Now sLs−1 is a Levi of sP s−1 = P containing sT s−1 = T .
By uniqueness, we have sLs−1 = L. By 1.12(a), UP ∩ ZG (s)0 equals the unipotent
radical of ZP (s)0 = ZG (s)0 hence it is 1. This implies, by 1.12(a), that ZP (s)0
is a parabolic of ZG (s)0 with Levi ZL (s)0 and with unipotent radical {1}. Hence
ZP (s)0 = ZG (s)0 = ZL (s)0 . In particular, ZG (s)0 ⊂ L. This proves the existence
of L. Assume now that L′ is another Levi of P such that ZG (s)0 ⊂ L′ . Since
T0 ⊂ ZG (s)0 , we have T0 ⊂ L′ . Hence T0 is contained in a maximal torus T ′ of L′ .
Now T ′ is also a maximal torus of G0 . Since T0 is contained in a unique maximal
torus of G0 (see 1.4(d)) we have T = T ′ . Thus, L, L′ are Levi subgroups of P
containing a common maximal torus of P . It follows that L = L′ . This proves (c).
1.14. Let g ∈ G be quasi-semisimple and let T1 be a maximal torus of ZG (g)0 .
Let N = {n ∈ G0 ; ngT1 n−1 = gT1 }. We show:
   (a) N 0 = T1 hence N /T1 is finite;
   (b) any element of gT1 is quasi-semisimple;
6                                      G. LUSZTIG

     (c) any quasi-semisimple element g ′ in gG0 is G0 -conjugate to some element in
gT1 ;
     (d) two elements g ′ , g ′′ ∈ gT1 are in the same G0 -conjugacy class if and only
if they are in the same N /T1 -orbit on gT1 for the N /T1 -action induced by the
conjugation action of N on gT1 .
(Closely related results for non connected compact Lie groups appear in [D].)
     We prove (a). Let T be the unique maximal torus of G0 such that T1 ⊂ T . We
have T1 = (T ∩ ZG (g))0 . (See 1.4(d).) If n ∈ N then ngn−1 = gτ with τ ∈ T1
and gT1 = ngT1 n−1 = gτ nT1 n−1 hence nT1 n−1 = T1 . Thus, N ⊂ NG0 (T1 ).
Since N 0 ⊂ NG0 (T1 ) we must have N 0 ⊂ ZG0 (T1 ) = T by a standard rigidity
argument. If n ∈ N 0 then ngn−1 = gtn with tn ∈ T1 ; since n ∈ ZG0 (T1 ), we see
that n 7→ tn is a morphism of algebraic groups f : N 0 −          → T1 . Clearly, we can find
k ≥ 1 such that g k is in ZZG (s)0 hence in T1 (since ZG (s)0 is reductive). Then
g k = ng k n−1 = (ngn−1 )k = (gtn )k = g k tkn hence tkn = 1 for all n ∈ N 0 . Thus,
f (N 0 ) is contained in a finite subgroup of T1 ; being connected, it is {1}. Thus
N 0 ⊂ T ∩ZG (g) hence N 0 ⊂ (T ∩ZG (g))0 = T1 . The inclusion T1 ⊂ N 0 is obvious
and (a) follows.
     We prove (b). The conjugation action of T1 on the variety of all Borels of G0
that are normalized by g must have a fixed point since this variety is projective.
Thus there exists a Borel B of G0 such that T1 ⊂ B, gBg −1 = B. Now T1 is
contained in some maximal torus of B, which is necessarily T , by the definition
of T . Since gT g −1 is a maximal torus of G that contains T , we have gT g −1 = T
(again by the definition of T ). If t ∈ T1 then t normalizes both B and T since
t ∈ T . Hence gt normalizes B and T . Thus, gt is quasi-semisimple.
     We prove (c). Let T1′ be a maximal torus in ZG (g ′ )0 . As in the proof of (b)
we can find a Borel B ′ of G0 and a maximal torus T ′ of B ′ such that T1′ ⊂ T ′
and g ′ B ′ g ′−1 = B ′ , g ′ T ′ g ′−1 = T ′ . We can find h ∈ G0 such that hB ′ h−1 =
B, hT ′ h−1 = T (with B, T as above). Let g ′′ = hg ′ h−1 . Then g ′′ Bg ′′−1 =
B, g ′′ T g ′′−1 = T . We also have gBg −1 = B, gT g −1 = T . We have g ′′ = gy
where y ∈ G0 satisfies yBy −1 = B, yT y −1 = T . It follows that y ∈ T . Since a
power of g is in T1 , Ad(g) : T −        → T has finite order. Using 1.2(a) we can write
y = g y2 gy2 y1 with y2 ∈ T, y1 ∈ (T ∩ ZG (g))0 = T1 . Then gy = y2 gy1 y2−1 . We
        −1       −1

see that gy is T -conjugate (hence G0 -conjugate) to gy1 . Hence g ′ is G0 -conjugate
to gy1 ∈ gT1 . This proves (c).
     We prove (d). Let g ′ , g ′′ ∈ gT1 be such that g ′′ = xg ′ x−1 where x ∈ G0 . We have
g ′′ = gt with t ∈ T1 . Clearly, T1 is a maximal torus of ZG (g ′ )0 and a maximal torus
of ZG (g ′′ )0 . Then x−1 T1 x is a maximal torus of ZG (x−1 g ′′ x)0 = ZG (g ′ )0 . The
maximal tori T1 , x−1 T1 x of ZG (g ′ )0 are conjugate in ZG (g ′ )0 that is, there exists
z ∈ ZG (g ′ )0 such that zx−1 T1 xz −1 = T1 . Let n = zx−1 . We have nT1 n−1 = T1
and n−1 g ′ n = xz −1 g ′ zx−1 = xg ′ x−1 = g ′′ . We have n−1 gT1 n = n−1 g ′ T1 n =
g ′′ n−1 T1 n = g ′′ T1 = gT1 so that n−1 ∈ N . This proves (c).
1.15. We shall need the following result.
   (a) The number of unipotent G-conjugacy classes of G is finite. The number of

These two statements are clearly equivalent. In the case where G = G0 is con-
nected, (a) is proved in [L1]. The author handled also the general case by a method
similar to that in [L1]. See [Sp, 4.1].

We have k>0 gk = Lie UPχ .
1.17. Let Q be a parabolic of G0 . Let g ∈ NG Q. We show that:
    (a) there exists u ∈ UQ and χ ∈ Hom(k∗ , G0 ) such that gχ(a)g −1 = uχ(a)u−1
for all a ∈ k∗ and Pχ = Q.
Let π : Q −   → Q/UQ be the obvious map. As one easily checks, one can find
χ ∈ Hom(k∗ , G0 ) such that χ′ (k∗ ) ⊂ π −1 (ZQ/U

maximal torus of π (ZQ/UQ ) that contains χ (k ). We can find n ≥ 1 such that
g n ∈ Q. For j ∈ [0, n − 1], g j T g −j is a maximal torus of π −1 (ZQ/U
                                                                     0

solvable group with unipotent radical UQ . Hence we can find uj ∈ UQ such
that g j T g −j = uj T u−1                          ∗                   −1 j ′

                                                                              ). For a ∈
k∗ we have π(χ(a)) = π(χ′ (a))f (π(χ′(a)))f 2 (π(χ′ (a))) . . . f n−1 (π(χ′ (a))). Since
f n = 1 it follows that f (π(χ(a))) = π(χ(a)) that is, π(gχ(a)g −1) = π(χ(a)).
By a standard argument, if λ, λ′ ∈ Hom(k∗ , Q) are such that π(λ(a)) = π(λ′ (a))
for all a ∈ k∗ , then there exists u ∈ UQ such that λ(a) = uλ′ (a)u−1 for all a.
Thus, there exists u ∈ UQ such that gχ(a)g −1 = uχ(a)u−1 for all a. We have
Pχj = u−1      j
           j g Pχ ′ g

                                             uj = u−1
                                                   j Quj = Q. Hence the k -action
                                                                                 ∗

a 7→ Ad(χj (a)) has > 0 weights on Lie UQ and < 0 weights on g/Lie Q. Since
these actions (for j = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1) commute with each other, it follows that the
k∗ -action a 7→ Ad(χ(a)) = Ad(χ0 (a))Ad(χ1 (a)) . . . Ad(χn−1 (a)) has > 0 weights
on Lie UQ and < 0 weights on g/Lie Q. Hence Pχ = Q. This proves (a).
1.18. Let g ∈ G. Let Q be a parabolic subgroup of ZG (gs )0 such that gu Qgu−1 =
Q. We show that
    (a) there exists a parabolic P of G0 such that P ∩ ZG (gs )0 = Q and gP g −1 = P .
By 1.17, we can find χ : k∗ −     → ZG (gs )0 such that Pχ (relative to ZG (gs )0 ) is
Q and there exists u ∈ UQ such that gu χ(a)gu−1 = uχ(a)u−1 for all a ∈ k∗ .
Since gs χ(a)gs−1 = χ(a) for all a, we have gχ(a)g −1 = uχ(a)u−1 for all a. Define
χ̃ : k∗ −→ G0 , χ̃′ : k∗ −
                         → G0 by χ̃(a) = χ(a), χ̃′ (a) = g χ̃(a)g −1 = uχ̃(a)u−1 for all
a. Let P = Pχ̃ (relative to G). From the definition we have Lie P ∩ Lie ZG (gs )0 =
Lie Q. Hence P ∩ ZG (gs )0 = Q. We have gP g −1 = Pχ̃′ = uP u−1 = P since
u ∈ UQ ⊂ Q ⊂ P . This proves (a).
1.19. Let T, T ′ be tori and let f ∈ Hom(T ′ , T ) be surjective. Let τ : T −→ T, τ ′ :
  ′      ′                                                          τ   ′τ ′
T −   → T be automorphisms of finite order with fixed point sets T , T such that
    ′
f τ = τ f . We show that
8                                      G. LUSZTIG

                                                            ′
   (a) f restricts to a surjective homomorphism (T ′τ )0 −
                                                         → (T τ )0 .
This can be reduced to the analogous statement where T, T ′ are replaced by their
groups of co-characters tensored by Q. In that case we use the fact that an
automorphism of finite order of a finite dimensional Q-vector space is semisimple.
1.20. Let π : G −   → Gss be the canonical map. Let a ∈ G be semisimple. Let
φ : ZG (a)0 −→ ZGss (π(a))0 be the homomorphism induced by π. We show that
    (a) φ is surjective and Ker(φ) ⊂ ZZ0 G (a)0 .
    (b) φ induces a surjective homomorphism ZZ0 G (a)0 −      → ZZ0 G (π(a))0 .
                                                                       ss
Let I be the image of φ. Let T be a maximal torus of ZGss (π(a))0 . Then
T ′ = π −1 (T ) is a torus in G0 and Ad(a)(T ′ ) = T ′ . Moreover, since ZG0 T ′
has finite index in NG T ′ , we see that there exists an integer n ≥ 1 such that
Ad(a)n (t′ ) = t′ for all t′ ∈ T ′ . Let T ′′ = {t′ ∈ T ′ ; Ad(a)(t′ ) = t′ }0 . The obvious
homomorphism T ′ −    → T restricts to a homomorphism T ′′ −     → T ′ which is surjective,
                      ′′          0                 ′
by 1.19(a). Since T ⊂ ZG (a) , we see that T ⊂ I. Thus, I contains the union of
all maximal tori of ZGss (π(a))0 , which is dense in ZGss (π(a))0 , since ZGss (π(a))0
is reductive, connected. Thus, I is dense in ZGss (π(a))0 . It is clearly closed, hence
I = ZGss (π(a))0 . This proves the first assertion of (a). The second assertion of
(a) is obvious. Now (b) is a special case of the following general statement. Let
H−  → H ′ be a surjective homomorphism of connected reductive groups whose ker-
                                                                                   0      0
nel is contained in the centre of H. Then the induced homomorphism ZH                −
                                                                                     → ZH   ′

is surjective.
1.21. If D is a connected component of G, we set
   (a) D ZG0 = ZG0 ∩ ZG (g)
where g ∈ D. (This does not depend on the choice of g.) We write D ZG         0
                                                                                0 instead

of ( ZG0 ) . Now let X be a subset of D stable under G -conjugacy. We show:
   (b) if D ZG0                   0
                0 X ⊂ X, then ZG0 X ⊂ X.
                                            0
(The converse is obvious.) Let z ∈ ZG         0 , g ∈ X. We must show that zg ∈ X.
                                    0                                  0          0
Clearly, some power of g is in G hence some power of Ad(g) : ZG          0 −→ ZG    0 is 1.

Using 1.2(a), we can write z = txgxg with t ∈ (ZG0 ∩ZG (g)) = ZG0 , x ∈ ZG                0.

Then zg = txgx ∈ txXx = tX = X. This proves (b).

We prove (a). Let σ ∈ C. By 1.21(d), we have C = {xzσx−1 ; x ∈ G0 , z ∈ D ZG0 }.
For x, z as above we have (xzσx−1 )s = xzσs x−1 since z = zs , zσ = σz. Thus,
Cs = {xzσs x−1 ; x ∈ G0 , z ∈ D ZG     0
                                         0 }, so that Cs is an orbit for the action 1.21(c)

closed normal subgroup of G and we may form G = G/ ZG0 . Let π : G −                   → G′
                                                                         ′0
be the obvious homomorphism. Then π(Cs ) is a semisimple G -conjugacy class
in G′ hence π(Cs ) is closed in G′ by 1.4(e). Let G′ ⊂ GLn (k) be an imbedding
of algebraic groups with n ≥ 1. Let Y be the (semisimple) class in GLn (k)
that contains π(Cs ). Let Y ′ = {h ∈ GLn (k); hs ∈ Y }. It is well known that
Y ′ is closed in GLn (k) and Y ′ −     → Y, g 7→ gs is a morphism of varieties. Hence
Y ∩ G is closed in G and ρ : Y ′ ∩ G′ −

varieties. Let X = {g ∈ π(D); gs ∈ π(Cs )}. Since π(Cs ) is closed in Y ∩ G′ and
X = ρ−1 (π(Cs )) ∩ π(D), we see that X is closed in Y ′ ∩ G′ . Next we note that
C ′ = π −1 (X ). (The inclusion C ′ ⊂ π −1 (X ) is obvious; the reverse inclusion follows
from the equality D ZG    0                               ′
                            0 Cs = Cs .) We see that C is closed in D. Let a ∈ Cs . Let

H be the isotropy group of a in D ZG         0

It follows that C −    → Cs , g 7→ gs is a morphism of algebraic varieties. This proves
(a).
    We prove (b). We have C̄ ⊂ D. From (a) we see that g 7→ gs is a morphism C̄ −          →
Cs . This morphism is equivariant with respect to the actions 1.21(c) of ZG0 ×G0 D 0

(transitive on Cs ). Since C is a dense subset of C̄ invariant under this action, it
follows that for any a ∈ Cs , the intersection of C with C̄a = {x ∈ C̄; xs = a} is
dense in C̄a . Take a = hs . Then any connected component c of C̄a contains some
point of C ∩ C̄a . Let c be the connected component containing h. Let h′ ∈ C ∩ c.
Then h′s = a. Since C̄a ⊂ ZG (a) we have c ⊂ ZG (a). More precisely, c is contained
in a connected component of ZG (a). Thus h′−1 h ∈ ZG (a)0 . This proves (b).
1.23. Let c be a G0 -conjugacy class in G. Let D be the connected component of
G that contains c. Let Γ = {z ∈ D ZG   0
                                         0 ; zc = c}. We show:

   (a) Γ is finite.
Let c ∈ c. If z ∈ Γ, then zc = cz = gcg −1 hence zcs = cs z = gcs g −1 for
some g ∈ G0 . Let T1 be a maximal torus of ZG (cs )0 . We have D ZG     0
                                                                          0 ⊂ T1 . By
                     0
1.4(a), 1.4(d), the G -conjugacy class of cs intersects cs T1 in a finite set that is,
F := {hcs h−1 ; h ∈ G0 } ∩ cs T1 is finite. Since cs Γ ⊂ F , we see that cs Γ is finite
and (a) follows.
   From (a) we deduce that, for any subgroup τ of D ZG     0
                                                             0 we have

   (b) dim(τ c) = dim τ + dim c.
1.24. Let c, c′ be two G0 -conjugacy classes in G contained in the same connected
10                                         G. LUSZTIG

component D of G. Let δ, δ ′ be two subtori in ζ := D ZG     0
                                                               0 . We show:

    (a) δc ∩ δ c is a finite union of subsets of the form (δ ∩ δ ′ )c′′ where c′′ are
              ′ ′
  0
G -conjugacy classes in D.
We may assume that δc ∩ δ ′ c 6= ∅. Let x ∈ δc ∩ δ ′ c′ . Let c1 be the G0 -conjugacy
class of x. Then δc = δc1 , δ ′ c′ = δ ′ c1 . Thus we may assume that c = c′ . Let Γ be
as in 1.23. Then φ : ζ × c − → ζc, (a, c) 7→ ac is a principal covering with group Γ
(which acts by z : (a, c) 7→ (az, c)). Since φ(δ × c) = δc, φ(δ ′ × c) = δ ′ c, we have
φ−1 (δc) = ∪z∈Γ (δz × c), φ−1 (δ ′ c) = ∪z∈Γ γ(δ ′ z × c) and

             φ−1 (δc ∩ δ ′ c) = ∪z∈Γ (δz × c) ∩ ∪z ′ ∈Γ (δ ′ z ′ × c)
              = ∪z,z ′ ∈Γ (δz × c) ∩ (δ ′ z ′ × c)) = ∪z,z ′ ∈Γ ((δz ∩ δ ′ z ′ ) × c).

Hence

           δc ∩ δ ′ c = φ(∪z,z ′ ∈Γ ((δz ∩ δ ′ z ′ ) × c)) = ∪z,z ′ ∈Γ ((δz ∩ δ ′ z ′ )c).

Now δz ∩ δ ′ z ′ is either empty or of the form (δ ∩ δ ′ )z1 with z1 ∈ ζ. Since Γ is finite
(see 1.23) we see that δc ∩ δ ′ c = ∪z1 (δ ∩ δ ′ )z1 c where z1 runs over a finite subset
of ζ. (For any such z1 , z1 c is a G0 -orbit in D.)
1.25. Let P ′ (resp. P ′′ ) be a parabolic of G0 with Levi L′ (resp. L′′ ). Assume
that L′ , L′′ contain a common maximal torus. Then P ′ ∩ P ′′ is a connected group
with Levi L′ ∩ L′′ . We show:
   (a) any g ∈ NG P ′ ∩ NG P ′′ can be written uniquely in the form g = zω where
z ∈ NG L′ ∩ NG P ′ ∩ NG L′′ ∩ NG P ′′ , ω ∈ UP ′ ∩P ′′ . Thus, NG P ′ ∩ NG P ′′ is a
semidirect product (NG L′ ∩ NG P ′ ∩ NG L′′ ∩ NG P ′′ )UP ′ ∩P ′′ .
Since g −1 normalizes P ′ ∩ P ′′ , we see that g −1 (L′ ∩ L′′ )g is a Levi of P ′ ∩ P ′′
hence it equals ω −1 (L′ ∩ L′′ )ω for some ω ∈ UP ∩P ′ . Then z := gω −1 normalizes
L′ ∩ L′′ and also P ′ and P ′′ . Now L′ is the unique Levi of P ′ that contains
L′ ∩ L′′ . Clearly, zL′ z −1 is again a Levi of P ′ that contains L′ ∩ L′′ . Hence
zL′ z −1 = L′ so that z ∈ NG L′ ∩ NG P ′ . Similarly, z ∈ NG L′′ ∩ NG P ′′ . Thus,
z ∈ NG L′ ∩ NG P ′ ∩ NG L′′ ∩ NG P ′′ and g = zω, as required. To prove uniqueness,
it is enough to show that (NG L′ ∩ NG P ′ ∩ NG L′′ ∩ NG P ′′ ) ∩ UP ′ ∩P ′′ = {1}. If
u ∈ UP ′ ∩P ′′ normalizes L′ and L′′ then, using u ∈ P ′ , we have u ∈ L′ and
similarly u ∈ L′′ hence u ∈ L′ ∩ L′′ ; but L′ ∩ L′′ , being a Levi of P ′ ∩ P ′′ , has
trivial intersection with UP ′ ∩P ′′ hence u = 1.
    We have
    (b) UP ′ ∩P ′′ = (L′ ∩ UP ′′ )(UP ′ ∩ P ′′ ) (semidirect product) and also UP ′ ∩P ′′ =
(L′′ ∩ UP ′ )(UP ′′ ∩ P ′ ) (semidirect product).
1.26. Let P be a parabolic of G0 with Levi L. Then
   (a) any g ∈ NG P can be written uniquely in the form g = zω where z ∈
NG L ∩ NG P, ω ∈ UP . Thus, NG P is a semidirect product (NG L ∩ NG P )UP .
This is a special case of 1.25(a) with P ′ = P ′′ = P, L′ = L′′ = L.

1.27. Let H ′ be an algebraic group, let H be a closed subgroup of H ′ and let c
be a semisimple H ′0 -conjugacy class in H ′ . Then
   (a) H ∩ c is a finite union of (semisimple) H 0 -conjugacy classes in H.
We can regard H ′ as a closed subgroup of GLn (k) for some n ≥ 1. Let c1 be
the conjugacy class in GLn (k) that contains c. It is enough to prove (a) with c
replaced by c1 . Thus we may assume that H ′ = GLn (k). Let D be a connected
component of H that contains some semisimple elements. We can find a closed
diagonalizable subgroup TD of H such that any H 0 -conjugacy class in D meets
TD . (We pick a semisimple element s ∈ D and a maximal torus T1 in ZH (s)0 . We
can take TD to be the subgroup generated by T1 and s. The fact that this has the
required properties can be deduced from the analogous property of the reductive
group H/UH 0 , see 1.14(c).) It is enough to prove that TD ∩ c is finite. Now TD is
contained in a maximal torus T of GLn (k) and it is enough to show that T ∩ c is
finite. But this is a well known property of GLn (k).

                           2. Isolated elements of G
2.1. Let g ∈ G. Let

               T (g) = (ZZG (gs )0 ∩ ZG (gu ))0 = (ZZ0 G (gs )0 ∩ ZG (gu ))0
                = (ZZG0 (gs )0 ∩ ZG0 (gu ))0 = (ZZG (gs )0 ∩ ZG (g))0

(a torus, since ZG (gs )0 is reductive). We have T )g) ⊂ ZG (g). We sometimes write
TG (g) instead of T (g). Clearly,

                       T (xgx−1 ) = xT (g)x−1 for any x ∈ G.

Let
                        L(g) = ZG0 (T (g)), L̂(g) = NG (L(g)).
Then
   (a) L(g) is the Levi of a parabolic P of G0 such that gP g −1 = P .
Indeed, we can find χ ∈ Hom(k∗ , G0 ) such that χ(k∗ ) ⊂ T (g) and L(g) =
ZG0 (χ(k∗ )). Then P = Pχ , see 1.16, is as required.
   From the definition we have
   (b) ZG (gs )0 ⊂ L(g).
The next result shows that L(g) is characterized by being minimal with the prop-
erties (a),(b).
   (c) Let Q be a parabolic of G0 with Levi L such that g ∈ NG L ∩ NG Q and
ZG (gs )0 ⊂ L. Then L(g) ⊂ L.
Since ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ) = L, see 1.10(a), it is enough to show that ZG0 (T (g)) ⊂
ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ) or that (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ⊂ T (g) or that (ZL0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂
T (g). Clearly, (ZL0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ ZG (gs ) hence (ZL0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ ZG (gs )0 . Since
ZG (gs )0 ⊂ L, we have ZL ∩ ZG (gs )0 ⊂ ZZG (gs )0 hence (ZL0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ ZZG (gs )0 .
12                                      G. LUSZTIG

Clearly, (ZL0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ ZG (g) hence (ZL0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ ZZG (gs )0 ∩ ZG (g) and
(ZL0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ (ZZG (gs )0 ∩ ZG (g))0 = T (g), as required.
   Since T (g) ⊂ ZG (g), we have g ∈ L̂(g) hence TL̂(g) (g) is defined. We have
   (d) TL̂(g) (g) = T (g).
Since ZL̂(g) (gu ) = ZG (gu ) ∩ L̂(g) and ZZL̂(g) (gs )0 ⊂ L̂(g), we have TL̂(g) (g) =
(ZZL̂(g) (gs )0 ∩ ZL̂(g) (gu ))0 = (ZZL̂(g) (gs )0 ∩ ZG (gu ))0 . From (b) we have ZG (gs )0 ⊂
L(g) ⊂ L̂(g) hence ZL̂(g) (gs )0 = ZG (gs )0 and TL̂(g) (g) = (ZZG (gs )0 ∩ ZG (gu ))0 =
T (g). This proves (d).
   We shall need the following result.
   (e) Let g, g ′ ∈ G be such that gs = gs′ and g ′−1 g ∈ ZG (gs )0 . Then T (g) = T (g ′ ).
We must show that (ZZ0 G (gs )0 ∩ ZG (g))0 = (ZZ0 G (gs )0 ∩ ZG (g ′ ))0 . It is enough to
show that, for x ∈ ZZ0 G (gs )0 , the conditions xg = gx and xg ′ = g ′ x are equivalent.
Since x commutes with any element of ZG (gs )0 , it commutes with g ′−1 g. This
proves (e).

2.2. We show that the following five conditions for g ∈ G are equivalent:
   (i) L(g) = G0 ;
   (ii) T (g) ⊂ ZG0 ;
   (iii) T (g) = D ZG  0
                         0 where D is the connected component of G containing g;

   (iv) there is no proper parabolic P of G0 with Levi L such that g ∈ NG L ∩
NG P, ZG (gs )0 ⊂ L;
   (v) there is no proper parabolic P of G0 such that g ∈ NG P, ZG (gs )0 ⊂ P .
Indeed, it is clear that (iii) =⇒ (ii)↔(i). Assume now that (ii) holds. Then any
element of T (g) commutes with any element of G0 ; since T (g) ⊂ ZG (g), we have
T (g) ⊂ ZG0 ∩ ZG (g). Since T (g) is connected, we have T (g) ⊂ (ZG0 ∩ ZG (g))0 .
The reverse inclusion is obvious. We see that (iii) holds. Thus, the equivalence of
(i),(ii),(iii) is established. The equivalence of (i) and (iv) follows from 2.1(c). It
remains to prove the equivalence of (iv),(v). It is enough to prove the following
statement.
   If P is a parabolic of G0 such that g ∈ NG P, ZG (gs )0 ⊂ P then there exists a
Levi of P that contains ZG (gs )0 and is normalized by g.
By 1.13(a) there is a unique Levi L of P such that ZG (gs )0 ⊂ L. Now gLg −1 is a
Levi of gP g −1 = P containing gZG (gs )0 g −1 = ZG (gs )0 . By uniqueness, we have
gLg −1 = L. This completes the prove of equivalence of (i)-(v).
   We say that g is isolated (in G) if it satisfies the equivalent conditions (i)-(v).
    If g ∈ G and G′ is a closed subgroup of G containing g and G0 then, clearly,
   (a) g is isolated in G if and only if g is isolated in G′ .
By 2.1(d) we have for g ∈ G:
    ZL̂(g) (TL̂(g) (g))0 = ZL̂(g) (T (g))0 = (L̂(g) ∩ ZG (T (g))0 (L̂(g))0 ,
hence
    (b) g is isolated in L̂(g).

2.3. Let π : G −  → Gss be the obvious map. Let g ∈ G. We show:
    (a) g is isolated in G if and only if π(g) is isolated in Gss . Equivalently, the
set of isolated elements in G is the inverse image under π of the set of isolated
elements in Gss .
Using the criterion 2.2(v) we see that it is enough to show that conditions (i),(ii)
below are equivalent:
    (i) there exists a proper parabolic P of G such that ZG (gs )0 ⊂ P, gP g −1 = P
    (ii) there exists a proper parabolic P̄ of Gss such that ZGss (π(g)s )0 ⊂ P̄ ,
π(g)P̄ π(g)−1 = P̄ .
Assume that (ii) holds. Let P̄ be as in (ii). Then P = π −1 (P̄ ) is as in (i).
Conversely, assume that (i) holds. Let P be as in (i). Then P̄ = π(P ) is as in (ii)
since π induces a surjection ZG (gs )0 −→ ZGss (π(g)s)0 (see 1.20(a)).
    From (a) we see that
    (b) the set of isolated elements in G is stable under left or right translation by
  0
ZG0 .
2.4. Let g ∈ G. By 1.9(a) (applied to ZG (gs ) instead of G) the set of unipotent
elements in ZG (gs )0 gu that are quasi-semisimple in ZG (gs ) is a single ZG (gs )0 -
conjugacy class. Let u be an element of this set. According to 1.4(c), gs u is
quasi-semisimple in G. Thus there exist a Borel of G0 and a maximal torus of
it, both normalized by gs u; these are automatically normalized by u, hence u is
quasi-semisimple in G. Let H = ZG (u), a reductive group, by 1.4(b). We have
gs ∈ H. We show that
    (a) ZZH (gs )0 and its subgroup ZZG (gs )0 ∩ H have the same identity component.
Let G̃ = ZG (gs ). Let H̃ = ZG̃ (u) (a reductive group by 1.4(b)). We must prove
that ZH̃ 0 and its subgroup Z(G̃0 ) ∩ H̃ have the same identity component. This
follows from 1.7(b) applied to G̃, u instead of G, u. (Note that 1.7(b) is applicable
by 1.8(a).)
    Next we show:
    (b) (ZG0 ∩ ZG (g))0 = (ZH 0 ∩ ZG (g))0 .
                                                  0              0
By 1.7(b) (with g replaced by u), we have ZH        0 = (ZG0 ∩ H) . (Note that 1.7(b)

is applicable by 1.8(a).) Since ZG (g) ⊂ H, the left hand side of (b) is

         (ZG0 ∩ H ∩ ZG (g))0 = ((ZG0 ∩ H)0 ∩ ZG (g))0 = (ZH
                                                          0
                                                            0 ∩ ZG (g))
                                                                        0



and this equals the right hand side of (b). This proves (b).
Lemma 2.5. In the setup of 2.4, g is isolated in G if and only if gs is isolated in
H.
   We have
                     TH (gs ) = (ZZH (gs )0 ∩ ZH (gs ))0 = ZZ0 H (gs ) ,

ZZG (gs )0 ∩H = ZZG (gs )0 ∩ZG (gu ) = ZZG (gs )0 ∩ZG (gs )∩ZG (gu ) = ZZG (gs )0 ∩ZG (g),
14                                     G. LUSZTIG

since u ∈ gu ZG (gs )0 . Hence T (g) = (ZZG (gs )0 ∩ H)0 . Using 2.4(a) we deduce that
T (g) = TH (gs ). The condition that g is isolated in G is that T (g) = (ZG0 ∩ZG (g))0 .
The condition that gs is isolated in H is that TH (gs ) = (ZH 0 ∩ ZH (gs ))0 that is,
TH (gs ) = (ZG0 ∩ ZG (g))0 (see 2.4(b)). These two conditions are equivalent since
T (g) = TH (gs ). The lemma is proved.
                              0
Lemma 2.6. Assume that ZG       0 = {1}. Then the set of semisimple elements that

are isolated in G is a union of finitely many G0 -conjugacy classes.
    We fix a connected component D of G which contains some semisimple element.
Let s be a semisimple element in D. Let T1 be a maximal torus of ZG (s)0 . By
1.14(c), any semisimple element in D is G0 -conjugate to some element in sT1 .
Hence it is enough to show sT1 contains only finitely many elements that are iso-
lated in G. There exist finitely many closed connected subgroups H1 , H2 , . . . , Hn
of G0 such that for any s′ ∈ sT1 , ZG (s′ )0 is one of H1 , H2 , . . . , Hn . (Indeed, with
the notation of 1.5, Lie ZG (s′ )0 is spanned by Lie T1 and by some of the lines
                                                                          0
gα , α ∈ R.) We have sT1 = ⊔i∈[1,n] Xi where Xi = {s′ ∈ sT1 ; ZG             (s′ ) = Hi }. If
s′ ∈ Xi , the condition that s′ is isolated in G is that ZHi is finite. Thus, either
all elements in Xi are isolated in G or none is isolated. We may assume that
Xi is non-empty and consists of isolated elements if and only if i ∈ [1, k]. Here
k ≤ n. We fix s′i ∈ Xi for each i ∈ [1, k]. If s′ ∈ Xi then s′ ∈ ZG (Hi ) and
s′i ∈ ZG (Hi ) hence s′i −1 s′ ∈ ZG (Hi ). Now s′i −1 s′ ∈ T1 ⊂ Hi . Hence s′i −1 s′ ∈ ZHi .
Thus, the set of elements of sT1 that are isolated in G is contained in the finite
set ∪i∈[1,k] s′i ZHi . The lemma is proved.
                                     0     0
Lemma 2.7. The action 1.21(c) of ZG    0 ×G on G leaves stable the set of isolated

elements in G and has only finitely many orbits there.
   From 2.3(a) we see that the first assertion of the lemma holds and that, to prove
the second assertion, it is enough to show that the conjugation action of G0ss on
the set of isolated elements in Gss has only finitely many orbits there. Thus we
                        0
may assume that ZG        0 = {1}. Let D be a connected component of G. Let Y be the

set of all elements of D that are isolated in G. Let Ỹ be the set of all pairs (g, u)
where g ∈ D, u is a unipotent element in ZG (gs )0 gu that is quasi-semisimple in
ZG (gs ) and gs is isolated in ZG (u). Let ρ : Ỹ −      → Y be the first projection. (This
is well defined and surjective by Lemma 2.5.) Let (g0 , u0 ) ∈ Ỹ . Let H = ZG (u0 )
(a reductive group, by 1.4(b)). Using 1.7(b) (which is applicable in view of 1.8(a))
                 0
we see that ZH     0 = {1}. Applying Lemma 2.6 to H instead of G, we can find

isolated semisimple elements s1 , s2 , . . . , sn in H such that any isolated semisimple
element in H is H 0 -conjugate to some si . By 1.15(a), for any i ∈ [1, n] we can find
unipotent elements vi1 , vi2 , . . . , vipi in ZG (si ) such that any unipotent element in
ZG (si ) is ZG (si )0 -conjugate to some vij . It is enough to show:
   (a) Let O be an orbit for the G0 -action on Ỹ given by conjugation on both
coordinates. Then (si vij , u′ ) ∈ O for some i ∈ [1, n], j ∈ [1, pi ] and some u′ .
(Indeed, since ρ is surjective, (a) would imply that any G0 -conjugacy class in
               CHARACTER SHEAVES ON DISCONNECTED GROUPS, I                                   15

Y contains si vij for some i ∈ [1, n], j ∈ [1, pi ].) Let (g, u) ∈ O. Now uG0 =
gu G0 = (g0 )u G0 = u0 G0 (since gG0 = g0 G0 = D). Thus u, u0 are unipotent,
quasi-semisimple in G, in the same connected component of G, hence u0 = huh−1
for some h ∈ G0 . (See 1.9(a).) We have (hgh−1 , huh−1 ) ∈ O. Setting g ′ = hgh−1
we have (g ′ , u0 ) ∈ O. Since gs′ is an isolated semisimple element in H, we can find
h′ ∈ H 0 such that h′ gs′ h′−1 = si with i ∈ [1, n]. We have (h′ g ′ h′−1 , h′ u0 h′−1 ) ∈ O.
Now h′ u0 h′−1 = u0 , the semisimple part of h′ g ′ h′−1 is h′ gs′ h−1 = si and the
unipotent part of h′ g ′ h′−1 is a unipotent element ṽi in ZG (si ). Thus we have
(si ṽi , u0 ) ∈ O. We can find h′′ ∈ ZG (si )0 such that h′′ ṽi h′′−1 = vij with j ∈ [1, pi ].
We have (si vij , h′′ u0 h′′−1 ) = (h′′ si ṽi h′′−1 , h′′ u0 h′′−1 ) ∈ O. This proves (a). The
lemma is proved.
Lemma 2.8. The set of isolated elements of G is closed in G.
   Using 2.3(a) we see that if the lemma holds for Gss then it holds for G. Hence
                          0               ′
we may assume that ZG       0 = {1}. Let G be the set of isolated elements of G. Since

G′ is a union of finitely many G0 -conjugacy classes (see Lemma 2.7), we see that
G′s is a union of finitely many semisimple G0 -conjugacy classes E 1 , E 2 , . . . , E n . For
i ∈ [1, n] let G′i be the inverse image of E i under G′ −  → G′s , g 7→ gs . It is enough
to prove that G′i is closed in G for any i ∈ [1, n]. Let E ′i = {g ∈ G; gs ∈ E i }.
By 1.22(a), E i , E ′i are closed in G and π : E ′i − → E i , g 7→ gs is a morphism.
Note that π commutes with the conjugation action of G0 on E i , E ′i and that
action is transitive on E i . Hence a G0 -stable subset of E ′i is closed if and only if
its intersection with π −1 (s) is closed in G for some/any s ∈ E i . Thus, to prove
that G′i is closed in E ′i (hence in G) it is enough to prove that, if s ∈ E i , then
{g ∈ G′i ; gs = s} = {g ∈ G′ ; gs = s} is closed in G. Let τ = ZZ0 G (s)0 . We must
show that {su; u ∈ G, u unipotent, us = su, (τ ∩ ZG (u))0 = {1}} is closed in G
or that {u ∈ ZG (s); u unipotent, (τ ∩ ZG (u))0 = {1}} is closed in ZG (s). Since
the set of unipotent elements in ZG (s) is closed in ZG (s), it is enough to show
that {g ∈ ZG (s); (τ ∩ ZG (g))0 = {1}} is closed in ZG (s). Let X be a connected
component of ZG (s). It is enough to show that X0 := {g ∈ X; (τ ∩ZG (g))0 = {1}}
is closed in X. Now τ ∩ ZG (g) depends only on the connected component of g in
ZG (s). Thus, either X0 = X or X0 = ∅. In both cases, X0 is closed in X. The
lemma is proved.

                               3. A stratification of G
3.1. For g, g ′ ∈ G we write g ∼ g ′ if g ′ g −1 ∈ T (g) = T (g ′ ). This is an equivalence
relation on G. For x ∈ G0 , g, g ′ ∈ G with g ∼ g ′ we have xgx−1 ∼ xg ′ x−1 since
xT (g)x−1 = T (xgx−1 ). Hence the relation on G given by g ≍ g ′ if xgx−1 ∼ g ′ for
some x ∈ G0 is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes on G for ≍ are
called the strata of G. Each stratum of G is contained in a connected component
of G and is stable under conjugation by G0 .
Lemma 3.2. Let π : G −    → Gss be the obvious homomorphism. Let g, g ′ ∈ G. We
have g ≍ g ′ (in G) if and only if π(g) ≍ π(g ′ ) (in Gss ). Thus, the strata of G are
16                                           G. LUSZTIG

exactly the inverse images under π of the strata of Gss and each stratum of G is
                                           0
stable under left or right translation by ZG 0.


   Let g ∈ G. By 1.20(b), π induces a surjective homomorphism of tori ZZ0 G (gs )0 −
                                                                                   →
 0
ZZG (π(g)s )0 . This is compatible with the automorphisms
     ss


          Ad(gu ) : ZZ0 G (gs )0 −
                                 → ZZ0 G (gs )0 , Ad(π(g)u) : ZZ0 Gss (π(g)s )0 −
                                                                                → ZZ0 G (gs )0 ,
which have finite order. (Some power of gu belongs to ZG (gs )0 .) Applying 1.19(a)
we see that π restricts to a surjective homomorphism
                  (ZZ0 G (gs )0 ∩ ZG (gu ))0 −
                                             → (ZZ0 Gss (π(g)s )0 ∩ ZGss (π(g)u))0 .
Thus, we have
   (a) π(TG (g)) = TGss (π(g)).
                               0              0          0              0
We have TG (g) ⊂ ((TG (g)ZG      0 ) ∩ ZG (g)) = TG (g)(ZG0 ∩ ZG (g)) = TG (g). Hence
                             0              0
   (b) TG (g) = ((TG (g)ZG0 ) ∩ ZG (g)) .
If z ′′ ∈ (ZG0 ∩ ZG (g))0 we have
   (c) TG (z ′′ g) = TG (g) and z ′′ g ∼ g.
The first assertion follows from 2.1(e) since (z ′′ g)s = gs and (z ′′ g)−1 g ∈ ZG (gs )0 .
The second assertion follows from the first since z ′′ gg −1 = z ′′ ∈ T (g).
             0
   If z ∈ ZG   0 then

   (d) TG (zg) = TG (g) and zg ≍ g ′ .
                                                             0             0            0
By 1.2(a) we have z = z ′ z ′′ gz ′−1 g −1 for some z ′ ∈ ZG   0, z
                                                                    ′′
                                                                       ∈ (ZG 0 ∩ ZG (g)) .

Hence
           TG (zg) = TG (z ′ z ′′ gz ′−1 ) = z ′ TG (z ′′ g)z ′−1 = z ′ TG (g)z ′−1 = TG (g)
where the third equality comes from (c). We also have zg = z ′ z ′′ gz ′−1 ≍ z ′′ g ≍ g.
(See (c).) This proves (d).
    Next, for g, g ′ ∈ G,
    (e) we have π(g) ∼ π(g ′ ) (in Gss ) if and only if zg ∼ g ′ (in G) for some
        0
z ∈ ZG    0.
                       0               ′          ′ −1 −1
Assume that z ∈ ZG       0 and zg ∼ g that is, g g     z ∈ TG (zg) = TG (g ′ ). Applying
π and using (a), we obtain π(g )π(g) ∈ TGss (π(g)) = TGss (π(g ′ )). Thus, π(g) ∼
                                   ′       −1

π(g ′ ) in Gss .
    Conversely, assume that π(g) ∼ π(g ′ ) in Gss that is, π(g ′ )π(g)−1 ∈ TGss (π(g)) =
                                                                0               0
TGss (π(g ′ )). Using (a), we deduce that g ′ g −1 ∈ TG (g)ZG              ′
                                                                  0 = TG (g )ZG0 . Thus
                                     0
g ′ = tzg where t ∈ TG (g), z ∈ ZG     0 . Using (b), we have

                             0            ′ 0
     TG (g ′ ) = ((TG (g ′ )ZG 0 ) ∩ ZG (g ))

                0                0           0             0
     = ((TG (g)ZG 0 ) ∩ ZG (tzg)) = ((TG (g)ZG0 ) ∩ ZG (g)) = TG (g) = TG (zg).

                                                                                 0
(The third equality holds since tz belongs to the commutative group TG (g)ZG       0

and the fifth equality comes from (d).) Thus, TG (g ′ ) = TG (zg). Now g ′ (zg)−1 =
t ∈ TG (g) = TG (zg). Hence g ′ ∼ zg. This proves (e).
   The lemma follows from (d),(e).

3.3. The set of isolated elements of G is a union of strata of G. (Assume that
g ∈ G is isolated and g ′ ∈ G is in the stratum of g. We must show that g ′ is
isolated. We may assume that g ′ ∼ g. Then T (g ′ ) = T (g). By assumption,
           0             ′       0        ′
T (g) ⊂ ZG   0 . Hence T (g) ⊂ ZG0 and g is isolated.) The strata of G that consist

of isolated elements are called isolated strata. We show:
                                                                                 0     0
    (a) any isolated stratum of G is a single orbit for the action 1.21(c) of ZG   0 ×G

on G.
                                                                              0
In view of 2.3(a) and Lemma 3.2, it is enough to consider the case where ZG     0 = {1}.
                                                                           0
In this case we must show that any isolated stratum C of G is a single G -conjugacy
class in G. Let g, g ′ ∈ C. We have g ′ = hzgh−1 where h ∈ G0 , z ∈ T (g). Since g
is isolated, we have T (g) = {1}. Hence g ′ = hgh−1 . This proves (a).
Lemma 3.4. Let C be a stratum of G. If g, g ′ ∈ C then ZG (g)0 , ZG (g ′ )0 are
G0 -conjugate.
   We may assume that g ∼ g ′ . We have g ′ = tg where t ∈ T (g). If x ∈ ZG (g)0
then x ∈ ZG (gs )0 and t ∈ ZZG (gs )0 hence xt = tx. We have also xg = gx
hence xtg = tgx. Thus, x ∈ ZG (g ′ ). We see that ZG (g)0 ⊂ ZG (g ′ ) so that
ZG (g)0 ⊂ ZG (g ′ )0 . Interchanging the roles of g, g ′ we obtain ZG (g ′ )0 ⊂ ZG (g)0
hence ZG (g)0 = ZG (g ′ )0 . The lemma is proved.
3.5. Let A be the set of all pairs (L, S) where L is a Levi of some parabolic of
G0 and S is an isolated stratum of NG L with the following property: there exists
a parabolic P of G0 with Levi L such that S ⊂ NG P . Now G0 acts on A by
conjugation. Let G0 \A be the set of orbits of this action.
Lemma 3.6. Let C be a stratum of G. For g ∈ C let L = L(g) and let S be
the stratum of NG L that contains g. Then (L, S) ∈ A and C →
                                                           7 (L, S) is a well
                                                      0
defined injective map from the set of strata of G to G \A.
   By 2.2(b), g is isolated in NG L. By 2.1(a) there exists a parabolic P of G0 with
Levi L such that g ∈ NG P . We have S ⊂ NG P . (Since S is an isolated stratum
of NG L, any element of S is of the form hzgh−1 with z ∈ ZL0 , h ∈ L (see 3.3(a));
clearly, hzgh−1 ∈ NG P .) Thus (L, S) ∈ A. Let g ′ ∈ G be such that g ≍ g ′ . Let
L′ = L(g ′ ) and let S ′ be the stratum of NG L′ that contains g ′ . We show that
(L, S), (L′, S ′ ) are in the same G0 -orbit. Replacing g by a G0 -conjugate, we may
assume that g ∼ g ′ . Then T (g) = T (g ′ ) hence L = L′ . Also g ′ g −1 ∈ T (g). Using
2.1(d) we have TNG L (g) = T (g) = T (g ′ ) = TNG L (g ′ ) and g ′ g −1 ∈ TNG L hence
g ∼ g ′ (relative to NG L). Hence S = S ′ . Thus the map in the lemma is well
defined. We show that it is injective. Assume that g, g ′ ∈ G are such that for
some h ∈ G0 we have hLh−1 = L′ where L = L(g), L′ = L(g ′ ) and hgh−1 ≍ g ′
where ≍ is relative to NG L′ . We must show that g ≍ g ′ (relative to G). Replacing
g by hgh−1 , we may assume that L = L′ , g ≍ g ′ (relative to NG L). Replacing
g by an L-conjugate, we may assume further that g ∼ g ′ (relative to NG L). We
have g ′ g −1 ∈ TNG L (g) = TNG L (g ′ ). But TNG L (g) = T (g), TNG L (g ′ ) = T (g ′ ), so
that g ∼ g ′ (relative to G). The lemma is proved.

Proposition 3.7. The number of strata of G is finite.
   By Lemma 3.6, it is enough to prove that G0 \A is finite. Since the Levi
subgroups L of parabolics of G0 fall into finitely many G0 -conjugacy classes, it is
enough to show that for any such L, there are only finitely many isolated strata
of NG L. This follows from Lemma 2.7 and 3.3(a). The proposition is proved.
3.8. Let P be a parabolic of G0 with Levi L. Let g be an isolated element of
NG L ∩ NG P . (Equivalently, g is an element of NG L ∩ NG P that is isolated in
NG L, see 2.2(a); indeed, NG L ∩ NG P ⊂ NG L have the same identity component,
L.) We show:
   (a) T (g) ⊂ (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ;
   (b) L ⊂ L(g);
We prove (a). Since gs ∈ NG L∩NG P we see from 1.12(b) that ZZ0 G (gs )0 ⊂ ZZ0 L (gs )0 .
Hence

                 T (g) = (ZZ0 G (gs )0 ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ (ZZ0 L (gs )0 ∩ ZG (g))0
                 = (ZZ0 L (gs )0 ∩ ZL (g))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0

where the last equality holds since g is isolated in NG L. This proves (a).
  From (a) we deduce ZG0 (T (g)) ⊃ ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ) = L (the last equality
comes from 1.10(a)). This proves (b).
3.9. Let P, L, g be as in 3.8. We show that the following three conditions are
equivalent:
    (i) L = L(g);
    (ii) T (g) = (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ;
    (iii) ZG (gs )0 ⊂ L.
If (ii) holds, then ZG0 (T (g)) = ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ) = L (see 1.10(a)) so that
(i) holds. Assume now that (i) holds. We show that (ii) holds. By 3.8(a) it is
enough to show that (ZL ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ T (g) or that (ZZG0 (T (g)) ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ T (g)
or that (ZZG0 (T (g)) ∩ZG (gs )0 ∩ZG (gu ))0 ⊂ ZZG (gs )0 ∩ZG (gu ). It is enough to show
that ZZG0 (T (g)) ∩ ZG (gs )0 ⊂ ZZG (gs )0 . This follows from ZG (gs )0 ⊂ ZG0 (T (g)) (a
consequence of the definition of T (g)).
    By 3.8(a), condition (ii) is equivalent to (ZL ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ T (g) and also to
(ZL ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ ZZG (gs )0 . Since (ZL ∩ ZG (g))0 ⊂ ZG (gs )0 this is also equivalent
to the condition ZG (gs )0 ⊂ ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZG (g))0 ) which by 1.10(a) is the same as
(iii).
3.10. Let P, L, g be as in 3.8. For any z ∈ (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 , the element zg is
isolated in NG L ∩ NG P . (This follows from 2.3(a) for NG L ∩ NG L instead of G.)
We show:
   (a) {z ∈ (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ; ZG (zgs )0 ⊂ L} is open dense in (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 .
Assume first that g = s is semisimple. Since s is isolated in NG L we have (ZL ∩
ZL (s))0 = ZZ0 L (s)0 . Hence it is enough to show:
               CHARACTER SHEAVES ON DISCONNECTED GROUPS, I                              19

   (b) {z ∈ ZZ0 L (s)0 ; ZL (zs)0 = ZG (zs)0 } is open dense in ZZ0 L (s)0 .
By 1.12(b) we can find a maximal torus T1 of ZL (s)0 which is also a maximal
torus of ZG (s)0 . Define gα , R as in 1.5 in terms of s, G, T1 . We have ZZ0 L (s)0 ⊂ T1 .
For z ∈ ZZ0 L (s)0 , ZG (zs)0 contains T1 and is normalized by s hence Lie ZG (zs)0 is
spanned by Lie T1 and by the gα with α ∈ R, α(zs) = 1. Similarly, Lie ZL (zs)0
is spanned by Lie T1 and by the gα with α ∈ R, α(zs) = 1, gα ⊂ Lie L. For each
α ∈ R we set Xα = {z ∈ ZZ0 L (s)0 ; α(zs) 6= 1}. We see that it is enough to show:
   (c) ∩α∈R;gα 6⊂Lie L Xα is open dense in ZZ0 L (s)0 .
Assume that gα 6⊂ Lie L but α(zs) = 1 for all z ∈ ZZL (s)0 )0 . Then α(s) = 1 and
α|Z 0 0 = 1. Thus, gα ⊂ Lie ZG0 (ZZ0 L (s)0 ) = Lie ZG0 ((ZL ∩ ZL (s))0 ) = Lie L
   ZL (s)

(the last equality comes from 1.10(a)). Now ga ⊂ Lie L is a contradiction. Thus,
for any α ∈ R such that gα 6⊂ Lie L, the open subset Xα of ZZ0 L (s)0 is non-empty
hence dense. It follows that (c) holds; (b) is proved.
    We now consider the general case. Let u be a unipotent element in ZL (gs )0 gu
which is quasi-semisimple in ZL (gs ). As in 2.4, u is quasi-semisimple in NG L.
Hence there exists a Borel β of L and a maximal torus T of β such that β and
T are normalized by u. Now UP is normalized by g hence by gu , hence by lgu
for any l ∈ L. Since u = lgu for some l ∈ L, we have u ∈ NG (UP ). Then u
normalizes βUP , a Borel of G0 containing T . Thus, u is quasi-semisimple in G
and H = ZG (u) is a reductive group. Similarly, L1 = ZL (u) is a reductive group;
it is a Levi of the parabolic P1 = ZP (u)0 of H 0 . By Lemma 2.5 (with G replaced
by NG L), gs is isolated in NH (L1 ). Also, gs ∈ NH (L1 ) ∩ NH (P1 ). Applying the
already proved part of (a) to H, L1 , P1 , gs instead of G, L, P, g we see that
    {z ∈ (ZL1 ∩ ZL1 (gs ))0 ; ZH (zgs )0 ⊂ L1 } is open dense in (ZL1 ∩ ZL1 (gs ))0 .
It is then enough to show that
    (d) (ZL1 ∩ ZL1 (gs ))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0
and that, for z in (d), we have ZH (zgs )0 ⊂ L1 if and only if ZG (zgs )0 ⊂ L, or
equivalently (see 3.9), that we have TH (zgs ) = (ZL1 ∩ ZL1 (zgs ))0 if and only if
TG (zg) = (ZL ∩ ZL (zg))0 . It is enough to prove (d) and that for any z in (d) we
have
    (e) TH (zgs ) = TG (zg),
    (f) (ZL1 ∩ ZH (zgs ))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (zg))0 .
As a special case of 1.7(b) we have ZL0 1 = (ZL ∩ ZL (u))0 hence
    (ZL1 ∩ ZL1 (gs ))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (u) ∩ ZL (ugs ))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 ,
so that (d) holds. (In the last equality we have used that u ∈ ZL (gs )0 gu .) Similarly,
for z in (d) we have
    (ZL1 ∩ ZL1 (zgs ))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (u) ∩ ZL (uzgs ))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (zg))0 ,
so that (f) holds. Now (e) is shown as in the proof of Lemma 2.5 (for zg instead
of g). The lemma is proved.

Lemma 3.11. Let (L, S) ∈ A. Let P be a parabolic of G0 with Levi L such that
S ⊂ NG P . Let S ∗ = {g ∈ S; ZG (gs )0 ⊂ L}. Then S ∗ is an open dense subset of
20                                     G. LUSZTIG

S.
   By 3.3(a) (for L), S is contained in a connected component δ of NG L ∩ NG P .
We set δ ZL = ZL ∩ ZL (g ′ ) for some/any g ′ ∈ δ. By 3.3(a) and 1.21(d), the action
1.21(c) of δ ZL0 × L on S is transitive. The restriction of this action to δ ZL0 is
a free action (left translation) and Ŝ = δ ZL0 \S is well defined. The conjugation
action of L on S induces a transitive L-action on Ŝ. Hence the condition that an
L-invariant subset X of S is open dense in S is equivalent to the condition that
for any δ ZL0 -orbit O on S, the intersection X ∩ O is open dense in O. For X = S ∗
this last condition holds by 3.10(a). The lemma is proved.
Proposition 3.12. (a) If (L, S) ∈ A then YL,S = ∪x∈G0 xS ∗ x−1 is a stratum of
G.
   (b) (L, S) 7→ YL,S is a bijection between G0 \A and the set of strata of G. In
particular, we have a partition G = ⊔L,S YL,S where L, S runs through a set of
representatives for the G0 -orbits in A; this is the same as the partition of G into
strata.
    We prove (a). By Lemma 3.11, S ∗ is non-empty. Hence YL,S is non-empty. Now
YL,S is contained in a stratum of G. (It is enough to show that S ∗ is contained
in a stratum of G. It is also enough to show that, if g, g ′ ∈ S ∗ and g ∼ g ′
relative to NG L, then g ∼ g ′ relative to G. This follows from the equalities
TG (g) = TNG L(g) (g) = TNG L (g), TG (g ′ ) = TNG L(g ′ ) (g ′ ) = TNG L (g ′ ), see 2.1(d),
3.9.) We show that YL,S is a stratum of G. It is enough to show that, if g ∈ S ∗ and
g ′ ∈ G, g ≍ g ′ relative to G, then g ′ ∈ YL,S . We may assume that g ′ ∼ g relative
to G. Since TG (g) = TG (g ′ ), we have L(g) = ZG0 TG (g) = ZG0 TG (g ′ ) = L(g ′ ).
Since g ∈ S ∗ we have L = L(g) (see 3.9). It follows that L(g ′ ) = L. In particular,
g ′ ∈ NG L. As above, we have TG (g) = TNG L (g), TG (g ′ ) = TNG L(g ′ ) (g ′ ) and the
last group equals TNG L (g ′ ) since L(g ′ ) = L. Since g ′−1 g ∈ TG (g) = TG (g ′ ), we see
that g ′−1 g ∈ TNG L (g) = TNG L (g ′ ). Thus g ′ ∼ g relative to NL G. It follows that
g ′ ∈ S. More precisely, since L = L(g ′ ), we have g ′ ∈ S ∗ , as required. This proves
(a).
    From the definitions it is clear that the map in (b) is the inverse of the map
C 7→ (L, S) in Lemma 3.6. The lemma is proved.
3.13. Let (L, S) ∈ A. Let

                      ỸL,S = {(g, xL) ∈ G × G0 /L; x−1 gx ∈ S ∗ }.

                 → YL,S by π(g, xL) = g. Now WS = {n ∈ NG0 L; nSn−1 = S}/L
Define π : ỸL,S −
(a subgroup of the finite group NG0 L/L) acts (freely) on ỸL,S by n : (g, xL) 7→
(g, xn−1 L).
   (a) This makes π : ỸL,S −
                            → YL,S into a principal WS -bundle.
We must show that, if g ∈ G, x ∈ G0 , x′ ∈ G0 satisfy x−1 gx ∈ S ∗ , x′−1 gx′ ∈ S ∗ ,
then x′ = xn−1 with n ∈ NG0 L, nSn−1 = S. Replacing g, x, x′ by x′−1 gx′ , x′−1 x, 1,
              CHARACTER SHEAVES ON DISCONNECTED GROUPS, I                           21

we see that we may assume that x′ = 1 and we must show that xLx−1 =
L, xSx−1 = S. We have g ∈ S ∗ , x−1 gx ∈ S ∗ and L = L(x−1 gx) = x−1 L(g)x =
x−1 Lx. If g ′ ∈ S then g ′ = hzgh−1 for some h ∈ L, z ∈ (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0 , see 3.3(a)
and 1.21(d). We have
  x−1 zx ∈ (Zx−1 Lx ∩ Zx−1 Lx (x−1 gx))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (x−1 gx))0 = (ZL ∩ ZL (g))0
(since x−1 gx ∈ gL) hence x−1 g ′ x = (x−1 hx)(x−1 zx)(x−1 gx)(x−1 h−1 x) ∈ S.
Thus, x−1 Sx ⊂ S. Since S is irreducible we have x−1 Sx = S, as required.
    Since ỸL,S is an irreducible variety of dimension
    dim(G0 /L) + dim S ∗ = dim(G0 /L) + dim S,
it follows that
    (b) YL,S is an irreducible constructible subset of G of dimension dim(G0 /L) +
dim S.
Lemma 3.14. Let (L, S) ∈ A. Let P be a parabolic of G0 with Levi L such that
                                                       ′
S ⊂ NG P . Let S̄ be the closure of S in NG L. Let YL,S     = ∪x∈G0 xS̄UP x−1 . Then
                              ′                    ′
the closure of YL,S in G is YL,S . In particular, YL,S   is independent of the choice
of P .
   Let X = {(g, xP ) ∈ G × G0 /P ; x−1 gx ∈ S̄UP }. Let φ : X −    → G be the first
projection. Then φ is proper since G0 /P is complete and S̄UP is a closed Ad(P )-
                                            ′
stable subset of NG P . Hence φ(X) = YL,S       is a closed subset of G. Since X is
irreducible of dimension dim(G /P ) + dim S + dim UP = dim(G0 /L) + dim S, we
                                 0
            ′
see that YL,S  is an irreducible variety of dimension ≤ dim(G0 /L) + dim S. Since
YL,S is an irreducible constructible subset of dimension dim(G0 /L)+dim S of YL,S
                                                                                ′
                                                  ′
(see 3.13(b)), it follows that YL,S is dense in YL,S . The lemma is proved.
Proposition 3.15. Let (L, S) ∈ A. The closure of YL,S in G is a union of strata
of G.
                ′                                                                ′
   Let P, S̄, YL,S   be as in 3.14. By Lemma 3.14, it is enough to show that YL,S    is
                                      ′                   0
a union of strata of G. Since YL,S is stable under G -conjugacy, it is enough to
show:
             ′
   if g ∈ YL,S , g ′ ∈ G, g ∼ g ′ , then g ′ ∈ YL,S
                                                ′

or the stronger statement:
                  ′                                 ′
   (a) if g ∈ YL,S    and z ∈ TG (g) then zg ∈ YL,S   .
                               0
Replacing (L, S, P ) by a G -conjugate we may assume that g ∈ S̄UP . Now gs ∈
NG P is semisimple hence it normalizes some Levi of P , see 1.4(a). Hence, replacing
(L, S) by a UP -conjugate we may assume in addition that gs ∈ NG L ∩ NG P . Let
f be the obvious projection of the semidirect product (NG L ∩ NG P )UP (see 1.26)
onto NG L ∩ NG P (a homomorphism of algebraic groups). Let h = f (g). We have
g = hu where h ∈ S̄, u ∈ UP and hs = f (gs ). Since gs ∈ NG L ∩ NG P we have
f (gs ) = gs so that gs = hs . Since the set of isolated elements of NG L is closed in
NG L (see Lemma 2.8) and it contains S, it must also contain S̄; thus, h is isolated
in NG L so that
22                                      G. LUSZTIG

   (b) TNG L (h) = (ZL ∩ ZG (h))0 .
We show that
   (c) TG (g) = TG (h).
Using 2.1(e) and the equality gs = hs we see that it is enough to show that
u ∈ ZG (gs )0 . Now gs = hs commutes with g and h hence it commutes with u.
Thus u ∈ UP ∩ ZG (gs ) = UP ∩ ZG (gs )0 (see 1.11) and (c) follows. We show that
   (d) TG (h) ⊂ TNG L (h).
that is, (ZZG (hs )0 ∩ ZG (hu ))0 ⊂ (ZZL (hs )0 ∩ ZG (hu ))0 . It is enough to show that
ZZG (hs )0 ⊂ ZZL (hs )0 . This follows from 1.12(b) since hs ∈ NG P . (Since S ⊂ NG P ,
we have S̄ ⊂ NG P hence h ∈ NG P .)
   From (b),(c),(d) we deduce that TG (g) ⊂ (ZL ∩ ZG (h))0 . Hence to prove (a) it
is enough to show:
   if g = hu, h ∈ S̄, u ∈ UP and z ∈ (ZL ∩ ZG (h))0 then zg ∈ S̄UP .
It is enough to show that z S̄ ⊂ S̄. This follows from zS ⊂ S (see 2.3(a)). The
lemma is proved.
Proposition 3.16. For (L, S) ∈ A, YL,S is a locally closed (irreducible) subvari-
                                          ′
ety of G. In particular, YL,S is open in YL,S .
   This follows from Proposition 3.15 using the following general fact.
   Assume that we are given an algebraic variety V and a partition V = ⊔j∈J Vj
where Vj are irreducible constructible subsets of V (J is finite) such that for any
j ∈ J, the closure of Vj is a union of subsets of the form Vj ′ . Then each Vj is
locally closed in V .
We may assume that J = {1, 2, . . . , n} and j ′ ≤ j whenever Vj ′ is contained in
the closure of Vj . Then for any j, ⊔j ′ ;j ′ ≤j Vj ′ and ⊔j ′ ;j ′ <j Vj ′ are closed in V and
Vj = ⊔j ′ ;j ′ ≤j Vj ′ − ⊔j ′ ;j ′ <j Vj ′ is locally closed in V .

3.17. We show that, for (L, S) ∈ A, YL,S is a smooth variety. Since ỸL,S is a
principal WS -bundle over YL,S (see 3.13(a)), it is enough to show that ỸL,S is
smooth. Consider the morphism ỸL,S −  → G0 /L, (g, xL) 7→ xL. This is a G0 -
equivariant fibration over the homogeneous space G0 /L whose fibre at L is S ∗ ,
which is smooth (being open in the homogeneous space S).

                               4. Dimension estimates
4.1. The estimates in this section are generalizations of results in [L2,§1] which
we follow closely.
                                                                                    0
   For any parabolic P of G0 we set P̃ = NG P, P̃ = P̃ /UP , P = P/UP = P̃ ; let
        → P̃ be the canonical map. Let P be a G0 -conjugacy class of parabolics of
πP : P̃ −
G0 . Assume that for each P ∈ P we are given a P -conjugacy class cP in P̃ such
that for any P ∈ P and any g ∈ G0 , Ad(g) carries πP−1 (cP ) onto πgP g −1 (cgP g −1 ).
Let
         z = {(g, P1, P2 ) ∈ G × P × P; g ∈ πP−1

                                                                     (ZP0 2 cP2 )},

                z′ = {(g, P1 , P2 ) ∈ G × P × P; g ∈ πP−1

                                                          (cP1 ) ∩ πP−1
                                                                      2
                                                                        (cP2 )}.
We have a partition z = ∪O zO where O runs over the G0 -orbits in P × P and
zO = {(g, P1 , P2 ) ∈ z; (P1 , P2 ) ∈ O}. Similarly we have a partition z′ = ∪O z′O
where z′O = {(g, P1 , P2 ) ∈ z′ ; (P1 , P2 ) ∈ O}. We say that O is good if for some/any
(P1 , P2 ) ∈ O, P1 , P2 have a common Levi. We say that O is bad if it is not good.
Let ν be the number of positive roots of G0 . Let ν̄ be the number of positive roots
of P , c̄ = dim cP , r̄ = dim(ZP ∩ ZP (γ))0 for P ∈ P, γ ∈ cP .
Proposition 4.2. Let c be a G0 -conjugacy class in G, c = dim c.
  (a) For any P ∈ P, x ∈ cP we have dim(c ∩ πP−1 (x)) ≤ (c − c̄)/2.
  (b) For any g ∈ c we have dim{P ∈ P; g ∈ πP−1 (cP )} ≤ (ν − 2c ) − (ν̄ − 2c̄ ).
  (c) Let d = 2ν − 2ν̄ + c̄ + r̄. Then dim zO ≤ d if O is good and dim zO < d if
O is bad. Hence dim z ≤ d.
  (d) Let d′ = 2ν − 2ν̄ + c̄. Then dim z′O ≤ d′ for all O. Hence dim z′ ≤ d.
   (We make the convention that the empty set has dimension −∞.) In the case
where P = {G0 }, the proposition is trivial. Therefore we may assume that P =               6
   0
{G } and that the result is already known when G is replaced by a group of strictly
smaller dimension.
   We prove (c) and (d). We can map zO and z′O to O by (g, P1, P2 ) 7→ (P1 , P2 ).
We see that proving (c) and (d) for zO , z′O is the same as proving that for a fixed
(P ′ , P ′′ ) ∈ O we have
   (c′ ) dim{πP−1′ (ZP0 ′ cP ′ ) ∩ πP−1′′ (ZP0 ′′ cP ′′ )} ≤ d − dim O,
   (d′ ) dim{πP−1′ (cP ′ ) ∩ πP−1′′ (cP ′′ )} ≤ d′ − dim O,
with strict inequality in (c′ ) if O is bad. Choose Levi subgroups L′ of P ′ and
L′′ of P ′′ such that L′ , L′′ contain a common maximal torus. Then P ′ ∩ P ′′ is a
connected group with Levi L′ ∩ L′′ . Let L̃′ = NG L′ ∩ P̃ ′ , L̃′′ = NG L′′ ∩ P̃ ′′ . By
                                       ′                                            ′′
1.26, we may identify L̃′ = P̃ via πP ′ . Similarly we identify L̃′′ = P̃ via πP ′′ .
Thus we regard cP ′ ⊂ L̃′ , cP ′′ ⊂ L̃′′ . If g ∈ P̃ ′ ∩ P̃ ′′ then, by 1.25(a),(b), we may
write uniquely g in the form zu′′ u = zu′ v where z ∈ L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ , u′′ ∈ L′ ∩ UP ′′ , u ∈
UP ′ ∩ P ′′ , u′ ∈ L′′ ∩ UP ′ , v ∈ UP ′′ ∩ P ′ . We see that (c′ ),(d′ ) are equivalent to
       dim{(u, v, u′′ , u′ , z) ∈ (UP ′ ∩ P ′′ ) × (UP ′′ ∩ P ′ ) × (L′ ∩ UP ′′ ) × (L′′ ∩ UP ′ )
(c”)
       × (L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ ); u′′ u = u′ v, zu′′ ∈ ZL0 ′ cP ′ , zu′ ∈ ZL0 ′′ cP ′′ } ≤ d − dim O,

       dim{(u, v, u′′ , u′ , z) ∈ (UP ′ ∩ P ′′ ) × (UP ′′ ∩ P ′ ) × (L′ ∩ UP ′′ ) × (L′′ ∩ UP ′ )
(d”)
       × (L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ ); u′′ u = u′ v, zu′′ ∈ cP ′ , zu′ ∈ cP ′′ } ≤ d′ − dim O,
with strict inequality in (c′′ ) if O is bad. When (u′ , u′′ ) ∈ (L′′ ∩ UP ′ ) × (L′ ∩ UP ′′ )
is fixed, the variety
R = {(u, v) ∈ (UP ′ ∩P ′′ )×(UP ′′ ∩P ′ ); u′′ u = u′ v} = {(u, v) ∈ UP ′ ×UP ′′ ; u′′ u = u′ v}
24                                            G. LUSZTIG

is isomorphic to UP ′ ∩ UP ′′ . (Indeed, if we set ũ = u′−1 u′′ uu′′−1 ∈ UP ′ , ṽ =
vu′′−1 ∈ UP ′′ , then R becomes {(ũ, ṽ) ∈ UP ′ × UP ′′ ; ũ = ṽ}.) Since dim(UP ′ ∩
UP ′′ ) = 2ν − 2ν̄ − dim O we see that (c′′ ),(d′′ ) are equivalent to

                  dim{(u′′ , u′ , z) ∈ (L′ ∩ UP ′′ ) × (L′′ ∩ UP ′ ) × (L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ );
(e)              zu′′ ∈ ZL0 ′ cP ′ , zu′ ∈ ZL0 ′′ cP ′′ } ≤ c̄ + r̄,


                  dim{(u′′ , u′ , z) ∈ (L′ ∩ UP ′′ ) × (L′′ ∩ UP ′ ) × (L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ );
(f)              zu′′ ∈ cP ′ , zu′ ∈ cP ′′ } ≤ c̄,

with strict inequality in (e) if O is bad.
    Let us consider the variety in (f). Let π3 be the projection of that variety on
the z-coordinate. We show
    (g) image(π3 ) is a union of finitely many L′ ∩ L′′ -conjugacy classes in the re-
ductive group L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ with identity component L′ ∩ L′′ .
Let H ′ = L̃′ ∩ P̃ ′′ = (L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ )(L′ ∩ UP ′′ ) (semidirect product) and let f ′ : H ′ − →
L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ be the projection zu′′ 7→ z. Let H ′′ = L̃′′ ∩ P̃ ′ = (L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ )(L′′ ∩ UP ′ )
(semidirect product) and let f ′′ : H ′′ −     → L̃′′ ∩ L̃′ be the projection zu′ 7→ z. Then
image(π3 ) = f ′ (H ′ ∩ cP ′ ) ∩ f ′′ (H ′′ ∩ cP ′′ ). Using 1.15(a) for G or reductive groups
of smaller dimension, we see that it is enough to show that

image(π3 )s = f ′ (H ′ ∩ cP ′ )s ∩ f ′′ (H ′′ ∩ cP ′′ )s = f ′ (H ′ ∩ (cP ′ )s ) ∩ f ′′ (H ′′ ∩ (cP ′′ )s )

is a union of finitely many (semisimple) L′ ∩ L′′ -conjugacy classes in L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ . It is
enough to show that H ′ ∩(cP ′ )s is a union of finitely many H ′0 = L′ ∩P ′′ -conjugacy
classes in H ′ and that H ′′ ∩ (cP ′′ )s is a union of finitely many H ′′0 = L′′ ∩ P ′ -
conjugacy classes in H ′′ . Since (cP ′ )s is a semisimple L′ -conjugacy class in L̃′ and
H ′ is a closed subgroup of L̃′ , the intersection H ′ ∩ (cP ′ )s is a union of finitely
many H ′0 -conjugacy classes in H ′ , see 1.27; similarly, H ′′ ∩ (cP ′′ )s is a union of
finitely many H ′′0 -conjugacy classes in H ′′ . This proves (g).
    We can write image(π3 ) = χ1 ∪ χ2 ∪ · · · ∪ χn where χi are (L′ ∩ L′′ )-conjugacy
classes in L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ . The inverse image under π3 of a point z ∈ χi is a product of
two varieties of the type considered in (a) but for a smaller group (G replaced by
L̃′ or L̃′′ ) hence by the induction hypothesis it has dimension ≤ (c̄ − dim χi )/2 +
(c̄ − dim χi )/2. Hence dim π3−1 (χi ) ≤ c̄. Since this holds for each i ∈ [1, n], we
see that the variety in (f) has dimension ≤ c̄. Thus, (d) is proved (assuming the
induction hypothesis).
    We now consider the variety in (e). Let p̃3 be the projection of that variety on
the z-coordinate. With the earlier notation we have

                    image(p̃3 ) = f ′ (H ′ ∩ ZL0 ′ cP ′ ) ∩ f ′′ (H ′′ ∩ ZL0 ′′ cP ′′ ).

By 1.21(d) (for L̃′ , L̃′′ instead of G) we have
                                                   ′                                 ′′

where δ ′ (resp. δ ′′ ) is the connected component of L̃′ (resp. L̃′′ ) that contains
                                          ′
cP ′ (resp. cP ′′ ). We have δ ZL0 ′ ⊂ ZL0 ′ ⊂ ZL0 ′ ∩L′′ ⊂ H ′ and f ′ (ζh) = ζf ′ (h) for

ζ ∈ δ ZL0 ′ , h ∈ H ′ hence f ′ (H ′ ∩ ZL0 ′ cP ′ ) = δ ZL0 ′ f ′ (H ′ ∩ cP ′ ). Similarly, f ′′ (H ′′ ∩
                   ′′
ZL0 ′′ cP ′′ ) = δ ZL0 ′′ f ′′ (H ′′ ∩ cP ′′ ). By an earlier argument we have f ′ (H ′ ∩ cP ′ ) =
ǫ′1 ∪ ǫ′2 ∪ · · · ∪ ǫ′r , f ′′ (H ′′ ∩ cP ′′ ) = ǫ′′1 ∪ ǫ′′2 ∪ · · · ∪ ǫ′′t where ǫ′1 , ǫ′2 , . . . , ǫ′r , ǫ′′1 , ǫ′′2 , . . . , ǫ′′t
are (L′ ∩ L′′ )-conjugacy classes in L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ . Thus,
                                                                            ′             ′′
                              image(p̃3 ) = ∪i∈[1,r],j∈[1,t](δ ZL0 ′ ǫ′i ∩ (δ ZL0 ′′ ǫ′′j ).

Here the set corresponding to i, j is empty unless ǫ′i , e′′j are contained in the same
connected component X = Xij of L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ . In that case we have
    δ′ 0                         ′′
      ZL′ ⊂ (ZLX′ ∩L′′ )0 and δ ZL0 ′′ ⊂ (ZLX′ ∩L′′ )0 .
(Indeed, since L′ ∩ L′′ is a Levi of a parabolic of L′ , we have ZL0 ′ ∩ ZL0 ′ ∩L′′ . Let
                                                                                     ′
x ∈ ǫ′i ⊂ L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ . We have x = f ′ (x̃) for some x̃ ∈ H ′ ∩ ZL0 ′ cP ′ . If z ∈ δ ZL0 ′ , then
z ∈ ZL0 ′ ∩L′′ and z x̃ = x̃. Hence f ′ (z)f ′ (x̃) = f ′ (x̃)f ′ (z) that is, zx = xz so that

z ∈ ZLX′ ∩L′′ . We see that δ ZL0 ′ ⊂ ZLX′ ∩L′′ hence δ ZL0 ′ ⊂ (ZLX′ ∩L′′ )0 . Similarly,
δ ′′ 0
    ZL′′ ⊂ (ZLX′ ∩L′′ )0 , as required.)

    Using now 1.24(a) we see that δ ZL0 ′ ǫ′i ∩ δ ZL0 ′′ ǫ′′j is a finite union of sets of the
         ′        ′′
form (δ ZL0 ′ ∩ δ ZL0 ′′ )δ where δ is a (L′ ∩ L′′ )-conjugacy class in L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ contained
in X. We see that
                                                                        ′            ′′

where δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δm are (L′ ∩ L′′ )-conjugacy classes in L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ such that for any
k, the connected component Xk of L̃′ ∩ L̃′′ that contains δk satisfies
   δ′ 0                          ′′
     ZL′ ⊂ Xk ZL0 ′ ∩L′′ and δ ZL0 ′′ ⊂ Xk ZL0 ′ ∩L′′ .
                                                     ′       ′′
The inverse image under p̃3 of a point z ∈ (δ ZL0 ′ ∩ δ ZL0 ′′ )δk is a product of two
varieties of the type considered in (a) but for a smaller group (G replaced by L̃′
or L̃′′ ) hence by the induction hypothesis it has dimension ≤ (c̄ − dim δk )/2 + (c̄ −
dim δk )/2. Hence
                          ′            ′′                                                 ′            ′′

          = c̄ − dim δk + dim(δ ZL0 ′ ∩ δ ZL0 ′′ ) + dim δk ≤ c̄ + dim(δ ZL0 ′ ) = c̄ + r̄

where the equality comes from 1.23(a). Since this holds for each k ∈ [1, m], we see
that the variety in (e) has dimension ≤ c̄ + r̄.
26                                         G. LUSZTIG

    Moreover, if the second inequality in (h) is an equality then O is good. (Indeed,
                       ′        ′′
in this case we have δ ZL0 ′ = δ ZL0 ′′ . Taking centralizers in G0 for both sides of the
previous equality and using 1.10(a), we obtain L′ = L′′ hence O is good.) Thus
(c) is proved (assuming the induction hypothesis).
    We show that (b) is a consequence of (d). Let z′ (c) = {(g, P1, P2 ) ∈ z′ ; g ∈ c}.
If z′ (c) = ∅ then the variety in (b) is empty and (b) follows. Hence we may assume
that z′ (c) 6= ∅. From (d) we have dim z′ (c) ≤ d′ . We map z′ (c) onto c by the first
projection. Each fibre of this map is a product of two copies of the variety in (b).
It follows that the variety in (b) has dimension equal to
                                                                          c̄   c
                    (dim z′ (c) − dim c)/2 ≤ (d′ − c)/2 = ν − ν̄ +           −
                                                                          2 2
and (b) is proved.
   We show that (a) is a consequence of (b). Consider the variety {(g, P ) ∈
c × P; g ∈ πP−1 (cP )}. Projecting it to the g-coordinate and using (b) we see that
it has dimension ≤ ν − ν̄ + 2c̄ + 2c . If we project it to the P -coordinate, each fibre
will be isomorphic to the variety c ∩ πP−1 (cP ) (with P ∈ P fixed). Hence
                                                     c̄  c         c̄ c
                  dim(c ∩ πP−1 (cP )) ≤ ν − ν̄ +        + − dim P = + .
                                                     2 2           2 2
Now c ∩ πP−1 (cP ) maps onto cP (via πP ) and each fibre is the variety in (a). Hence
the variety in (a) has dimension ≤ 2c̄ + 2c − c̄ = (c− c̄)/2. The proposition is proved.
4.3. In the case where O is good, the variety in 4.2(e) is ZL0 ′ cP ′ ∩ ZL0 ′ cP ′′ since
L′ = L′′ . This is empty if ZL0 ′ cP ′ 6= ZL0 ′ cP ′′ and is ZL0 ′ cP ′ if ZL0 ′ cP ′ = ZL0 ′ cP ′′ .
In the last case, it follows that zO is irreducible of dimension equal to d.
4.4. The inequality in 4.2(b) can be reformulated as follows. Let us fix P0 ∈ P and
a P 0 -conjugacy class c0 in P̃ 0 with dim c0 = c̄. Let δ be the connected component
of P̃ 0 that contains c0 . Then for any g ∈ c we have
    (a) dim{xP0 ∈ G0 /P0 ; x−1 gx ∈ πP−1      0
                                                 (c0 )} ≤ (ν − 2c ) − (ν̄ − 2c̄ ).
We have the following variant of (a):
    (b) dim{xP0 ∈ G0 /P0 ; x−1 gx ∈ πP−1       0
                                                 (ZP0 0 c0 )} ≤ (ν − 2c ) − (ν̄ − 2c̄ ).
This follows from (a) by observing that, for given g, there exist finitely many
P 0 -conjugacy classes c1 , c2 , . . . , ct in P̃ 0 of dimension c̄ such that
    x ∈ G0 , x−1 gx ∈ πP−1 0
                             (ZP0 0 c0 ) =⇒ x−1 gx ∈ πP−1      0
                                                                 (c1 ∪ · · · ∪ ct ).
Since ZP0 0 c0 = δ ZP0 0 c0 , it is enough to show that
     (c) δ ZP0 0 c0 ∩ πP0 (c ∩ P̃0 )
is a union of finitely many P 0 -conjugacy classes in P̃ 0 . (All P 0 -conjugacy classes
contained in δ ZP0 c0 have dimension c̄.) Using 1.15(a) it is enough to show that
                       0

the set of semisimple parts of the elements in (c) that is, δ ZP0 (c0 )s ∩ πP0 (cs ∩ P̃0 ),
                                                                 0
is a finite union of (semisimple) P 0 -conjugacy classes. This follow from the fact
that cs ∩ P̃0 is a finite union of (semisimple) P0 -conjugacy classes in P̃0 (see 1.27).

                             5. Some complexes on G
5.1. We fix a prime number l invertible in k. We use the term ”local system”
instead of Q̄l -local system. For an algebraic variety V let D(V ) be the bounded de-
rived category of Q̄l -sheaves on V . For K ∈ D(V ) let Hi K be the i-th cohomology
sheaf of K.
5.2. Let C be an isolated stratum of G. For any integer n ≥ 1, invertible in
k, let Sn (C) be the category whose objects are the local systems on C that are
                                   0        0
equivariant for the (transitive) ZG  0 × G -action

                  → xz n gx−1
   (a) (z, x) : g −
on C.
If a local system is in Sn (C) then it is also in Sn′ (C) for any n′ ≥ 1 invertible in k
such that n′ ∈ nZ. Let S(C) be the category whose objects are the local systems
on C that are in Sn (C) for some n as above.
Lemma 5.3. Let C be an isolated stratum of G. Let C ′ be the image of C under
the obvious map π : G −   → Gss (an isolated stratum of Gss ). Let C ′′ be the image
of C under the obvious map ρ : G −  → G/G0der , where G0der is the derived group of
G0 (C ′′ is a connected component of G/G0der and an isolated stratum of G/G0der ).
The following two conditions for a local system E on C are equivalent:
   (i) E ∈ S(C);
   (ii) E ∼
          = ⊕m      ∗ ′     ∗ ′′       ′        ′   ′′       ′′
               i=1 π Ei ⊗ ρ Ei where Ei ∈ S(C ), Ei ∈ S(C ) are irreducible and
            ′            ′′
π:C−   → C ,ρ : C − → C are the restrictions of π, ρ above.
    The fact that (ii) implies (i) is immediate. We prove the converse. Let ′ G = G/Γ
                0      0                                                  ′
where Γ = ZG       0 ∩Gder (a finite normal subgroup of G). The image C of C under the

obvious map λ : G −     → ′ G is an isolated stratum of ′ G and λ restricts to λ : C −→ ′C
(a principal covering with group Γ). Let E be as in (i). Then λ∗ E ∈ S(′ C) (note
however that, if E ∈ Sn (C), then λ∗ E is not necessarily in Sn (′ C)). We may assume
that E is irreducible. There is natural surjective map λ∗ λ∗ (E) −     → E. Since λ∗ λ∗ (E)
                                                 ∗
is semisimple, E is a direct summand of λ λ∗ (E). We can find an irreducible direct
summand ′ E of the local system λ∗ (E) on ′ C such that E is a direct summand of
λ∗ (′ E). We have canonically ′ G0 = G0 /ZG        0       0   0        ′        ′
                                                     0 × G /Gder and C = C × C . It
                                                                                      ′′

follows from the definitions that ′ E is an external tensor product E ′ ⊠ E ′′ where
E ′ ∈ S(C ′ ), E ′′ ∈ S(C ′′ ) are irreducible local systems. Since E ′′ is irreducible and
equivariant with respect to a transitive action of a connected commutative group,
it has rank 1. Since π ∗ E ′ is the inverse image of an irreducible local system under
a smooth map with connected fibres, it is itself an irreducible local system. Since
λ∗ (′ E) = π ∗ E ′ ⊗ ρ∗ E ′′ is a tensor product of an irreducible local system and a rank
1 local system, it is irreducible. It follows that E = λ∗ (′ E) = π ∗ E ′ ⊗ ρ∗ E ′′ . The
lemma is proved.
5.4. Let (L, S) ∈ A. Let P be a parabolic of G0 with Levi L such that S ⊂ NG P .
To simplify notation, in this section we set Y = YL,S , Ỹ = ỸL,S . As in 3.14, let
X = {(g, xP ) ∈ G × G0 /P ; x−1 gx ∈ S̄UP }; let φ : X −
                                                       → G be the first projection.

Let f be the obvious projection of the semidirect product (NG L ∩ NG P )UP (see
1.26) onto NG L ∩ NG P (a homomorphism of algebraic groups).
                                                                  ∼
Lemma 5.5. (g, xL) 7→ (g, xP ) is an isomorphism γ : Ỹ −→ φ−1 (Y ).
   We verify this only at the level of sets. Assume that (g, xL), (g ′, x′ L) ∈ Ỹ
have the same image under φ. Then g = g ′ and x′ = xp with p ∈ P . We have
x−1 gx ∈ S ∗ , x′−1 gx′ ∈ S ∗ hence p−1 x−1 gxp ∈ S ∗ . It follows that L(x−1 gx) =
L = L(p−1 x−1 gxp) = p−1 L(x−1 gx)p = p−1 Lp. Thus, p−1 Lp = L so that p ∈ L
and xL = x′ L. Thus, γ is injective.
   To show that γ is surjective it is enough to show that, if g ∈ S ∗ , x ∈ G0 satisfy
x−1 gx ∈ S̄UP , then u−1 x−1 gxu ∈ S ∗ for some u ∈ UP or equivalently that,
   if g ′ ∈ S̄UP , x ∈ G0 satisfy xg ′ x−1 ∈ S ∗ , then u−1 g ′ u ∈ S ∗ for some u ∈ UP .
Now gs′ ∈ NG P is semisimple hence it normalizes some Levi of P (see 1.4(a))
that is, some UP -conjugate of L. Hence, replacing g ′ , x by u′−1 g ′ u′ , xu′ for some
u′ ∈ UP we may assume in addition that gs′ ∈ NG L ∩ NG P . We have g ′ = hv
where h = f (g ′ ) ∈ S̄, v ∈ UP and hs = f (gs′ ). Since gs′ ∈ NG L ∩ NG P we have
f (gs′ ) = gs′ so that gs′ = hs . Then h−1 g ′ ∈ UP ∩ ZG (gs′ ) = UP ∩ ZG (gs′ )0 . Using
2.1(e), we see that T (g ′ ) = T (h). By 1.22(b), we can find h′ ∈ S such that hs = h′s
and h′−1 h ∈ ZG (hs )0 . Then T (h) = T (h′ ), by 2.1(e). Thus, T (g ′ ) = T (h′ ). By
3.8(b) we have L ⊂ L(h′ ) = L(g ′ ). Since xg ′ x−1 ∈ S ∗ , we have L(xg ′ x−1 ) = L
hence L(g ′ ) = x−1 Lx. Thus, L ⊂ x−1 Lx. Since L, x−1 Lx are irreducible of
the same dimension, we have L = x−1 Lx. Hence NG L = x−1 NG Lx. Since
xg ′ x−1 ∈ S ∗ ⊂ NG L, we have g ′ ∈ NG L. Thus, g ′ ∈ NG L ∩ S̄UP hence g ′ ∈ S̄.
Since g ′ ∈ x−1 S ∗ x, we see that x−1 Sx ∩ S̄ 6= ∅. Now x−1 Sx is a stratum of NG L
since x ∈ NG L. Since S̄ is a union of strata of NG L one of which is S and the
others have dimension < dim S, we see that x−1 Sx = S. This, together with
x ∈ NG L, implies that x−1 S ∗ x = S ∗ . Since g ′ ∈ x−1 S ∗ x, we see that g ′ ∈ S ∗ .
Thus, γ is surjective. The lemma is proved.
5.6. Let E ∈ S(S). We define a local system Ẽ on Ỹ by the requirement that
b∗ E = a∗ Ẽ where a(g, x) = (g, xL), b(g, x) = x−1 gx in the diagram

                         a                                    b
                        − {(g, x) ∈ G × G0 ; x−1 gx ∈ S ∗ } −
                     Ỹ ←                                   → S.

(We use the fact that a is a principal L-bundle and b∗ E is L-equivariant.) For
any stratum S ′ of NG L ∩ NG P such that S ′ ⊂ S̄ we set XS ′ = {(g, xP ) ∈ G ×
G0 /P ; x−1 gx ∈ S ′ UP }. Then X = ⊔S ′ XS ′ (union over all S ′ ⊂ S̄ as above;
there are only finitely many S ′ in the union, see 3.7). By Lemma 2.8, each S ′ is
an isolated stratum of NG L ∩ NG P . Note that each XS ′ is smooth, irreducible.
We define a local system Ē on XS by the requirement that b′∗ E = a′∗ Ē where
a′ (g, x) = (g, xP ), b′ (g, x) = f (x−1 gx) in the diagram

                        a′                                        b′

              CHARACTER SHEAVES ON DISCONNECTED GROUPS, I                              29

(We use the fact that a′ is a principal P -bundle and b′∗ E is P -equivariant.) It is
easy to see that the restriction of Ē to Ỹ (identified with an open subset of X as
in Lemma 5.5) is Ẽ. The intersection cohomology complexes IC(X, Ē) (on X) and
IC(S̄, E) (on S̄) are related by
   (a) b′′∗ IC(X, Ē) = a′′∗ IC(S̄, E)
where a′′ (g, x) = (g, xP ), b′′ (g, x) = f (x−1 gx) in the diagram

                       a′′                                      b′′
                   X ←− {(g, x) ∈ G × G0 ; x−1 gx ∈ S̄UP } −→ S̄.

Here a′′ is a principal P -bundle and b′′ is a locally trivial fibration with smooth
connected fibres. We write φ : X −       → Ȳ for the restriction of φ : X −
                                                                           → G. Here Ȳ
                            1
is the closure of Y in G . Recall that we have a finite covering (principal bundle)
π : Ỹ −→ Y (see 3.13(a)) hence π! Ẽ is a well defined local system on Y . Thus
IC(Ȳ , π! Ẽ) is well defined (on Ȳ ).

Proposition 5.7. φ! (IC(X, Ē)) is canonically isomorphic to IC(Ȳ , π! Ẽ).
   Let K = IC(X, Ē) and let K ∗ = IC(X, Ē ∗ ) where Ē ∗ is defined like Ē by
replacing E by the dual local system E ∗ . Then K ∗ is the Verdier dual of K with
a suitable shift. Since φ is proper, it follows that φ! (K ∗ ) is the Verdier dual of
φ! K with a suitable shift. We have K|Ỹ = Ē|Ỹ = Ẽ. Using Lemma 5.5, we see
that φ! K|Y = π! Ẽ. By the definition of an intersection cohomology complex we
see that it is enough to verify the following statement.
   For any i > 0 we have dim suppHi (φ! K) < dim Y −i and dim suppHi (φ! (K ∗ )) <
dim Y − i.
We shall only verify this for K; the corresponding statement for K ∗ is entirely
analogous.
   If g ∈ Ȳ , the stalk Hgi (φ! K) at g is equal to Hci (φ−1 (g), K). We have a partition
φ−1 (g) = ∪S ′ (φ−1 (g)∩XS ′ ) where S ′ runs over the strata of NG L∩NG P contained
in S̄. If Hci (φ−1 (g), K) 6= 0 then Hci (φ−1 (g) ∩ XS ′ , K) 6= 0 for some S ′ . Hence it
is enough to prove:
   For any i > 0 and any S ′ as above we have dim{g ∈ Ȳ ; Hci (φ−1 (g) ∩ XS ′ , K) 6=
0} < dim Y − i.
Assume first that S ′ 6= S. If Hci (φ−1 (g) ∩ XS ′ , K) 6= 0 then the hypercohomology
spectral sequence for K on φ−1 (g) ∩ XS ′ shows that we can write i = j1 + j2 with
j2 ≤ 2 dim(φ−1 (g)∩XS ′ ) and Hj1 (K|φ−1 (g)∩XS ′ ) 6= 0 hence Hj1 (K)|XS ′ 6= 0. Using
5.6(a), we see that Hj1 (K) is a local system on XS ′ (since Hj1 IC(S̄, E) is a local
system on S ′ , which is a (ZL0 ×L)-orbit on NG L∩NG P ). Thus, XS ′ ⊂ suppHj1 (K).
Since K = IC(X, Ē), it follows that j1 < dim X −dim XS ′ = dim S −dim S ′ . Thus
we have i < 2 dim(φ−1 (g) ∩ XS ′ ) + dim S − dim S ′ and it is enough to show that

                                           i  1
     dim{g ∈ Ȳ ; dim(φ−1 (g) ∩ XS ′ ) >     − (dim S − dim S ′ )} < dim Y − i.

If this is violated for some i > 0, it would follow that the space of triples

       {(g, xP, x′P ) ∈ Ȳ × G0 /P × G0 /P ; x−1 gx ∈ S ′ UP , x′−1 gx′ ∈ S ′ UP }

has dimension > dim Y − i + i − (dim S − dim S ′ ) = dim G0 /L + dim S ′ . This
contradicts 4.2(c).
  Next, assume that S ′ = S. If Hci (φ−1 (g) ∩ XS , K) 6= 0 then i ≤ 2 dim(φ−1 (g) ∩
XS ) since K|φ−1 (g)∩XS is a local system. Hence it is enough to show that for i > 0
we have
                                                    i
                 dim{g ∈ Ȳ ; dim(φ−1 (g) ∩ XS ) ≥ } < dim Y − i.
                                                    2
Assume that this is violated for some i > 0. Thus, setting F = {g ∈ Ȳ ; dim(φ−1 (g)∩
XS ) ≥ 2i }, we have dim F ≥ dim Y − i. Then the space of triples

        {(g, xP, x′P ) ∈ F × G0 /P × G0 /P ; x−1 gx ∈ SUP , x′−1 gx′ ∈ SUP }

has dimension ≥ dim G0 /L + dim S (and the last inequality is strict if dim F >
dim Y −i). From 4.2(c) we see that this space of triples has dimension ≤ dim G0 /L+
dim S hence it has dimension equal to dim G0 /L + dim S, which forces dim F =
dim Y − i. We partition our space of triples into subsets by specifying the G0 -orbit
of (xP x−1 , x′ P x′−1 ) (for simultaneous conjugation). By 4.2(c), the subset corre-
sponding to a bad orbit has dimension < dim G0 /L + dim S. It follows that the
subset corresponding to some good orbit has dimension equal to dim G0 /L+dim S.
Thus there exists n ∈ NG0 L such that
(a)
{(g, xP, x′P ) ∈ F × G0 /P × G0 /P ; x−1 gx ∈ SUP , x′−1 gx′ ∈ SUP ; x−1 x′ ∈ P nP }

has dimension equal to dim G0 /L + dim S. By 4.3, the variety
(b)
{(g, xP, x′P ) ∈ G × G0 /P × G0 /P ; x−1 gx ∈ SUP , x′−1 gx′ ∈ SUP ; x−1 x′ ∈ P nP }

is empty if nSn−1 6= S and is irreducible of dimension dim G0 /L + dim S if
nSn−1 = S. It follows that we must have nSn−1 = S and the variety (a) is
dense in the variety (b). It follows that F is dense in the image I of the variety
(b) under the first projection. Hence dim I = dim Y − i. If g ∈ S ∗ then (g, P, nP )
belongs to the variety (b). Thus, S ∗ ⊂ I. Since I is stable under G0 -conjugacy,
we must have Y ⊂ I. Thus, dim I ≥ dim Y . It follows that dim Y − i ≥ dim Y
hence i ≤ 0, contradicting i > 0. The proposition is proved.

                           6. Cuspidal local systems
6.1. In this section we fix an isolated stratum C of G. Let D be the connected
component of G that contains C.

Lemma 6.2. Let P be a parabolic of G and let g ∈ C ∩NG P . Let cP be the P/UP -
conjugacy class of the image of g in NG P/UP . Let δ = dim C −dim D ZG
                                                                     0
                                                                       0 −dim cP .
                                                                i
Then dim(C ∩ gUP ) ≤ δ/2. Hence for any E ∈ S(C) we have Hc (C ∩ gUP , E) = 0
for i > δ.
   If y ∈ gUP , then the semisimple elements ys , gs normalize UP and are in the
same UP -coset hence, by a standard argument, are UP -conjugate. Using the finite-
ness of the number of unipotent classes in ZG (gs ), see 1.15, we deduce that gUP
is contained in the union of finitely many G0 -conjugacy classes in G. It is then
enough to show that for any G0 -conjugacy class c in G such that c ⊂ C, we have
dim(c ∩ gUP ) ≤ 12 δ. This follows from 4.2(a), since dim C = dim c + dim D ZG 0
                                                                                 0,

see 1.23(b).
6.3. Let E ∈ S(C). We say that E is a cuspidal local system or that (C, E) is a
cuspidal pair for G if, for any P, g as in 6.2, with P 6= G0 we have Hcδ (C ∩gUP , E) =
0 where δ is as in 6.2.
Lemma 6.4. Let E ∈ S(C). Let us write E = ⊕m             ∗ ′    ∗ ′′
                                                    i=1 π Ei ⊗ ρ Ei as in Lemma 5.3.
                                                           ′  ′
Then (C, E) is a cuspidal pair for G if and only if (C , Ei ) is a cuspidal pair for
Gss for i = 1, . . . , m (with C ′ as in Lemma 5.3.)
    Since the property of being cuspidal is preserved by taking direct sums of local
systems or by passage to a direct summand, we see that we may assume that m = 1.
Next we note that, for P, g as in 6.2, we have (π ∗ E1′ ⊗ρ∗ E1′′ )|C∩gUP ∼ = (π ∗ E1′ )|C∩gUP
since (ρ E1 )|C∩gUP ∼
          ∗ ′′                                                          ′′
                       = Q̄l . Hence we may also assume that E1 = Q̄l . We set
E = E1 . We must show that (C, E) is a cuspidal pair for G if and only if (C ′ , E ′ )
  ′     ′

is a cuspidal pair for Gss .
    Assume that (C ′ , E ′ ) is a cuspidal pair for Gss . To show that (C, E) is a cuspidal
pair for G we must show that for any P, g as in 6.2 with P 6= G0 we have Hcδ (C ∩
gUP , E) = 0 where δ is as in 6.2. Let P̄ = π(P ), a proper parabolic of G0ss . By
assumption we have Hcδ̃ (C ′ ∩ π(g)UP̄ , E ′ ) = 0 where CP̄ is the P̄ /UP̄ -conjugacy
class of the image of π(g) in NGss P̄ /UP̄ and δ̃ = dim C ′ − dim CP̄ . It is clear
                                                        ∼
that π restricts to an isomorphism C ∩ gUP −→ C ′ ∩ π(g)UP̄ . Since dim C −
dim D ZG  0          ′
            0 = dim C and dim CP = dim CP̄ (CP as in 6.2), we have δ = δ̃. Hence

Hcδ (C ∩ gUP , E) ∼= Hcδ̃ (C ′ ∩ π(g)UP̄ , E ′ ) and we see that (C, E) is a cuspidal pair
for G. The reverse implication is proved in a similar way. The lemma is proved.
6.5. Lemma 6.4 shows that the study of ccuspidal pairs for G can be reduced to
the analogous problem for Gss . We will show that we can further reduce to the
case of a unipotent class.
    Assume that G = Gss . Let E ∈ S(C). For any x ∈ Cs let C x = {u ∈
ZG (x); u unipotent, xu ∈ C}. Then ZG0 (x) acts transitively (by conjugation) on
C x . Let E x be the inverse image of E under C x −
                                                  → C, u 7→ xu.
Lemma 6.6. The following three conditions are equivalent:
  (i) (C, E) is a cuspidal pair for G;
32                                    G. LUSZTIG

    (ii) there exists x ∈ Cs such that for some/any ZG (x)0 -conjugacy class C ′ in
C x , the pair (C ′ , E x |C′ ) is cuspidal for ZG (x).
    (iii) for any x ∈ Cs and for some/any ZG (x)0 -conjugacy class C ′ in C x , the
pair (C ′ , E x |C′ ) is cuspidal for ZG (x).

    We prove (i) assuming that (ii) holds. Assume that we are given g ∈ C and a
proper parabolic P of G0 such that g ∈ NG P . The P/UP -conjugacy class of the
image ḡ of g in NG P/UP is denoted by cP . We must show that Hcδ (C ∩gUP , E) = 0
where δ = dim C − dim cP . Since g ∈ NG (UP ), we have gs ∈ NG (UP ) hence
(gs UP )s = V where V = {vgs v −1 ; v ∈ UP } ⊂ Cs . Hence y 7→ ys is a morphism
f : C ∩gUP −  → V. Since f commutes with the conjugation action of UP on C ∩gUP
and V, we have Hcδ (C ∩ gUP , E) ∼   = Hcδ−2 dim V (f −1 (gs ), E). Now u 7→ gs u defines
                         ∼                                              ∼
{u ∈ C gs ; u ∈ gu UP } −→ f −1 (gs ) or equivalently, C gs ∩ gu UQ −→ f −1 (gs ) where
Q = P ∩ZG (gs )0 (a parabolic of ZG (gs )0 with UQ = UP ∩ZG (gs ) = UP ∩ZG (gs )0 ).
It is then enough to show that Hcδ−2 dim V (C gs ∩ gu UQ , E ′ ) = 0. (We have gu ∈
NG Q ∩ ZG (gs ).) Since ZG0 (gs ) acts transitively on C gs , we see that C gs is a
disjoint union of finitely many ZG (gs )0 -conjugacy classes. It is enough to show
that for any such conjugacy class C ′ we have Hcδ−2 dim V (C ′ ∩ gu UQ , E ′ ) = 0. (If
this holds for some C ′ then it automatically holds for all C ′ , by the transitivity of
the ZG0 (gs )-action on C gs .) This would follow from (iii) provided that we verify:
    Q 6= ZG (gs )0 and δ − 2 dim V = δ ′
where cQ is the Q/UQ -conjugacy class of the image of gu in NZG (gs ) Q/UQ and
δ ′ = dim C ′ − dim cQ .
    If Q = ZG (gs )0 then ZG (gs )0 ⊂ P . Hence g is not isolated, a contradiction.
    We now show that δ − 2 dim V = δ ′ that is, dim C − dim cP − 2 dim V = dim C ′ −
dim cQ . Now Q/UQ = ZP/UP (ḡs )0 and cQ may be identified with the ZP/UP (ḡs )0 -
conjugacy class of ḡu in NG P/UP . Consider the morphism x 7→ xs , cP −        → (cP )s ;
the fibre of this morphism at ḡs is the ZP/UP (ḡs )-conjugacy class of ḡu in NG P/UP
which has pure dimension dim cQ . We see that dim cP − dim cQ = dim(cP )s . We
also have dim C = dim C ′ + dim Cs . Thus dim C − dim cP − 2 dim V − dim C ′ +
dim cQ = dim Cs −dim(cP )s −2 dim V. To prove that this is 0 it is enough to show
that (dim G−dim ZG (gs ))−(dim L1 −dim ZL1 (gs ))−2(dim UP −dim ZUP (gs )) = 0
where L1 be a Levi subgroup of P normalized by gs . Since dim G = dim L1 +
2 dim UP it is enough to show that dim ZG (gs ) = ZL1 (gs ) + 2 dim ZUP (gs ). This
follows from the fact that ZG (gs )0 is reductive and ZL1 (gs )0 is a Levi of a parabolic
of ZG (gs )0 with unipotent radical ZUP (gs ) (see 1.12(a)). This proves (i).
    We prove (iii) assuming that (i) holds. Let x ∈ Cs and let C ′ be a ZG (x)0 -
conjugacy class in C x . Assume that we are given y ∈ C ′ and a proper parabolic
Q of ZG (x)0 such that y ∈ NZG (x) Q. The Q/UQ -conjugacy class of the image ȳ
                                                                      ′
of y in NZG (x) Q/UQ is denoted by cQ . We must show that Hcδ (C ′ ∩ yUQ , E ′ ) = 0
                                                                    ′
where δ ′ = dim C ′ − dim cQ . It is enough to show that Hcδ (C gs ∩ gu UQ , E ′ ) = 0.
Let g = xy = yx. We have g ∈ C and x = gs , y = gu . By 1.18(a),we can
find a parabolic P of G0 such that g ∈ NG P and P ∩ ZG (gs )0 = Q. Clearly,
               CHARACTER SHEAVES ON DISCONNECTED GROUPS, I                                  33

P 6= G0 . By the arguments and notation in the first part of the proof, we see that
    ′
Hcδ (C gs ∩ gu UQ , E ′ ) is isomorphic to Hcδ (C ∩ gUP , E) which is 0 by assumption.
This proves (iii).
   Now (ii) and (iii) are equivalent since G0 acts transitively by conjugation on
Cs . The lemma is proved.
6.7. Let A be a simple perverse sheaf on G. We say that A is admissible if the
following condition is satisfied: there exists (L, S) ∈ A, a cuspidal irreducible local
system E ∈ S(S) and an irreducible direct summand Ẽ1 of the local system Ẽ on
Ȳ (with Ȳ , Ẽ defined as in 5.6 in terms of L, S, E), such that A is isomorhic to
IC(Ȳ , Ẽ1 )[dim Ȳ ] regarded as a simple perverse sheaf on G (0 on G − Ȳ ).
