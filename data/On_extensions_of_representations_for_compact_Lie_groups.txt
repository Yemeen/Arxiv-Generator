                                                    G/H is connected. This paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for every
                                                    complex representation of H to be extendible to G, and also for every complex G-

                                                    that the condition holds when the fundamental group of G/H is torsion free.

                                               One of the classical problems in finite group theory is to characterize extensions of
                                            representations. We mean an extension of a representation in the following way: Given
                                            a normal subgroup H of a group G, a (complex) representation œÅ : H ‚Üí GL(n, C) is
                                            called extendible to G if there exists a representation œÅe: G ‚Üí GL(n, C) (called a G-
                                            extension) such that œÅ = œÅe on H. It is to be noted that the dimension n is not changed,
                                            since œÅ as a sub-representation is always contained in the restriction of the induced
                                            representation of œÅ to H.
                                               In the case of finite G, it is well known that every complex irreducible representation of
                                            H, which is G-invariant under conjugation (see Section 2 for the definition), is extendible
                                            to G if the second group cohomology H 2 (G/H, C‚àó ) vanishes [Isa76, Theorem 11.7].
                                            On the other hand the extension problem for infinite groups has not been extensively
                                            studied. In this article we study the problem for compact Lie groups when G/H is
                                            connected. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition for every complex
                                            representation of H to be extendible to G. It is also shown that the condition is related
                                            to a topological invariant, the fundamental group of G/H.
                                               For any group G, let G‚Ä≤ denote the commutator subgroup of G.

                                            that G/H is connected. Then every complex representation of H is extendible to G if
                                            and only if H is a direct summand of G‚Ä≤ H.

if the fundamental group œÄ1 (G/H) is torsion free, or equivalently if (G/H)‚Ä≤ is simply
connected.
   Our theorem provides a complete characterization of the triviality of complex G-
vector bundles over the homogeneous space G/H. Let E be a complex G-vector bundle
over G/H. We recall that E is trivial if it is isomorphic to the product bundle G/H √óV
for some complex G-module V . Since E is uniquely determined by the fiber at the
identity element of G/H (say E0 ), the bundle E is trivial if and only if E0 as a complex
representation of H is extendible to G. Theorem 1.1 leads us to the following corollary.
Corollary 1.3. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such
that G/H is connected. Then every complex G-vector bundle over the homogeneous
space G/H is trivial if and only if H is a direct summand of G‚Ä≤ H.           
   The existence of G-extensions plays an important role even in equivariant K-theory.
Let X be a connected topological space with a compact Lie group G action. Let H be
the normal subgroup of G which consists of all elements of G acting trivially on X. Then
the projection G ‚Üí G/H induces the canonical homomorphism œÜ : KG/H (X) ‚Üí KG (X)
which sends a G/H-vector bundle over X to the same bundle viewed as a G-vector
bundle with the trivial H-action.
   On the other hand, suppose that every complex irreducible representation of H is
extendible to G. Then there is an injective group homomorphism e : R(H) ‚Üí R(G)
between two representation rings defined as follows. For each irreducible complex H-
module U choose a G-extension UG , and define e([U]) = [UG ] where [ ] denote the
classes in the representation rings. Then extend the definition of e to R(H) so that
it defines a homomorphism R(H) ‚Üí R(G). For each complex G-module V we can
associate the trivial complex G-vector bundle V = X √ó V , which defines the natural
homomorphism t : R(G) ‚Üí KG (X). We now define a group homomorphism
(1)         ¬µ : R(H) ‚äó KG/H (X) ‚Üí KG (X),          (V, Œæ) 7‚Üí t ‚ó¶ e(V ) ‚äó œÜ(Œæ).
   This homomorphism is an isomorphism. Indeed, the inverse is given as follows. Let
Irr(H) denote the set of all isomorphism classes of complex irreducible representations
of H. For each [œá] ‚àà Irr(H) choose a G-extension of œá, and let Vœá be the corresponding
G-module to the chosen G-extension. For a complex G-vector bundle E over X, the
canonical isomorphism

                               =
                                   M
                            E‚àí ‚Üí        Vœá ‚äó HomH (Vœá , E)
                                 [œá]‚ààIrr(H)

induces a group homomorphism KG (X) ‚Üí R(H) ‚äó KG/H (X) which is the desired
inverse (see [CKMS99, Section 2] for more general arguments). Therefore we have a
generalization of Proposition 2.2 in [Seg68] which deals with the extreme case when G
acts trivially on X.
Corollary 1.4. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such
that G/H is connected. Let X be a connected G-space such that H acts trivially on X.
If H is a direct summand of G‚Ä≤ H, then the map ¬µ : R(H) ‚äó KG/H (X) ‚Üí KG (X) in (1)
can be defined, and it is a group isomorphism.                                    
  This article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we shall give some basic notions and
then show that a complex irreducible representation of H, which is G-invariant under
           ON EXTENSIONS OF REPRESENTATIONS FOR COMPACT LIE GROUPS                        3

conjugation, induces an associated projective representation of G which may be viewed
as a G-extension in the projective representation level. Section 3 is devoted to prove
that every complex representation of H has a G-extension when G/H is connected and
abelian. In Section 4 we shall proceed the study in the case that G/H is semisimple
and connected. After showing that the extension problem can be reduced to this case,
we shall prove Theorem 1.1.

                   2. Associated projective representations
   Let G be a topological group and H a closed normal subgroup of G. By a (com-
plex) representation of G we shall mean a continuous homomorphism of G into the
general linear group GL(n, C) of nonsingular n √ó n matrices over the field C of complex
numbers. A representation œÅ : H ‚Üí GL(n, C) is called extendible to G if there exists a
representation œÅe: G ‚Üí GL(n, C) (called a G-extension of œÅ) such that œÅ(h) = œÅe(h) for
all h ‚àà H.
                                       œÅ
                                   H      / GL(n, C)
                                             :
                                             œÅe

                                     G
Moreover, it is enough to get a G-extension of œÅ that there is a representation œÅe: G ‚Üí
GL(n, C) such that its restriction to H is isomorphic (or similar) to œÅ, i.e., there exists
a matrix M ‚àà GL(n, C) such that M ‚àí1 œÅe(h)M = œÅ(h) for all h ‚àà H.
   Given a representation œÅ : H ‚Üí GL(n, C) the map gœá : H ‚Üí C defined by the conju-
gation gœá(h) = œá(g ‚àí1 hg) becomes a representation of H for each g ‚àà G. We say that œÅ
is G-invariant if it is isomorphic to the conjugate representation gœÅ for all g ‚àà G, which
is a necessary condition of œÅ to be extendible to G.
  In the following we assume that a representation œÅ : H ‚Üí GL(n, C) is irreducible
and G-invariant. Then there exists a matrix Mg ‚àà GL(n, C) for each g ‚àà G such that
Mg‚àí1 œÅ(h)Mg = gœÅ(h) = œÅ(g ‚àí1 hg) for all h ‚àà H. Since œÅ is irreducible, the Schur‚Äôs lemma
implies that Mg is unique up to multiplication by nonzero constant in C‚àó = C \ {0}. So
we are able to define a function œÅ‚àó of G into the projective linear group PGL(n, C) =
GL(n, C)/C‚àó by œÅ‚àó (g) = [Mg ] for each g ‚àà G, where [Mg ] denotes the image of Mg by
the canonical projection œÄ : GL(n, C) ‚Üí PGL(n, C).

Lemma 2.1. Let G be a topological group and H a compact normal subgroup of G.
Given a complex irreducible representation œÅ : H ‚Üí GL(n, C) which is G-invariant, the
function œÅ‚àó : G ‚Üí PGL(n, C) defined above is a continuous homomorphism, called the
projective representation of G associated with œÅ. Moreover, the image of œÅ‚àó is contained
in U(n)/S 1 ‚äÇ PGL(n, C) if œÅ is a unitary representation of H.
4                  JIN-HWAN CHO, MIN KYU KIM, AND DONG YOUP SUH

Proof. It is immediate that œÅ‚àó is a homomorphism. Since H is compact we may assume
that œÅ is a unitary representation of H, i.e., the image of œÅ is contained in the unitary
group U(n). Then Mg is a constant multiple of a matrix in U(n) so that œÅ‚àó (g) is
contained in U(n)/S 1 for all g ‚àà G. For the continuity of œÅ‚àó it suffices to show that the
graph of œÅ‚àó in G √ó PGL(n, C) is closed, since U(n)/S 1 is a compact Hausdorff space.
  Consider the family of continuous maps Œ¶h : G √ó GL(n, C) ‚Üí GL(n, C) for each
h ‚àà H given by (g, M) 7‚Üí œÅ(h)MœÅ(g ‚àí1 hg)‚àí1 M ‚àí1 . Then the set
              \            [

             h‚ààH           g‚ààG

is the inverse image of the graph of œÅ‚àó in G √ó PGL(n, C) by the canonical projection
1 √ó œÄ : G √ó GL(n, C) ‚Üí G √ó PGL(n, C), which is obviously closed in G √ó GL(n, C).
Therefore the graph of œÅ‚àó is also closed in G √ó PGL(n, C).                         
  We may say that œÅ is extendible to G in the projective representation level, since
œÅ (h) = [œÅ(h)] for all h ‚àà H, i.e., œÅ‚àó = œÄ ‚ó¶ œÅ on H.

Note that any G-extension (if exists) œÅe of œÅ is a lifting homomorphism of œÅ‚àó , i.e.,
œÅ‚àó = œÄ ‚ó¶ œÅe, since œÅ‚àó (g) = [e
                             œÅ(g)] for all g ‚àà G.
Remark. In case that G is finite, choose a transversal T containing e for H in G and
set Me = I, the identity matrix in GL(n, C). For each t ‚àà T and h ‚àà H, the map
œÅ‚Ä≤ : G ‚Üí GL(n, C) sending th 7‚Üí Mt œÅ(h) is a lifting (not necessarily homomorphism)
of œÅ‚àó , i.e., œÄ ‚ó¶ œÅ‚Ä≤ = œÅ‚àó , and it determines a cocycle Œ≤ in the second group cohomology
H 2 (G/H, C‚àó ), which depends only on œÅ. Moreover, œÅ is extendible to G if and only if
Œ≤ is trivial, see [Isa76, Theorem 11.7] for more details.

                3. Extensions when G/H is connected abelian
  In this section we shall prove that every complex representation of H is extendible
to G when G/H is compact, connected, and abelian, that is a torus. We begin with
a general result on extensions of representations in the special case when G = SH for
some closed subgroup S of G.
Lemma 3.1. Let G be a compact topological group such that G = SH for a closed
subgroup S and a closed normal subgroup H of G. Then a complex representation
œÅ : H ‚Üí GL(n, C) is extendible to G if and only if there exists a representation œï : S ‚Üí
GL(n, C) such that
    (1) œï = œÅ on S ‚à© H, and
    (2) œï(s)‚àí1 œÅ(h)œï(s) = œÅ(s‚àí1 hs) for all s ‚àà S and h ‚àà H.
Proof. The necessity is obvious so we prove the sufficiency. Define a function œÅe: G ‚Üí
GL(n, C) by œÅe(sh) = œï(s)œÅ(h) for s ‚àà S and h ‚àà H. It is immediate that œÅe = œÅ
on H. In this proof we shall use the symbols s, s‚Ä≤ and h, h‚Ä≤ for elements in S and H,
respectively.

  Claim: œÅe is well-defined. If sh = s‚Ä≤ h‚Ä≤ ‚àà G, then (s‚Ä≤ )‚àí1 s = h‚Ä≤ h‚àí1 ‚àà S ‚à© H. Then
the condition (1) implies that œï(s‚Ä≤ )‚àí1 œï(s) = œÅ(h‚Ä≤ )œÅ(h)‚àí1 and thus œÅe(sh) = œï(s)œÅ(h) =
œï(s‚Ä≤ )œÅ(h‚Ä≤ ) = œÅe(s‚Ä≤ h‚Ä≤ ).
  Claim: œÅe is a homomorphism. For sh, s‚Ä≤ h‚Ä≤ ‚àà G, the condition (2) implies that
                     œÅe((s‚Ä≤ h‚Ä≤ )(sh)) = œï(s‚Ä≤ )œï(s)œÅ(s‚àí1 h‚Ä≤ s)œÅ(h)
                                    = œï(s‚Ä≤ )œï(s)œï(s)‚àí1 œÅ(h‚Ä≤ )œï(s)œÅ(h)
                                    = œÅe(s‚Ä≤ h‚Ä≤ )e
                                                œÅ(sh),
since (s‚Ä≤ h‚Ä≤ )(sh) = (s‚Ä≤ s)(s‚àí1 h‚Ä≤ s)h and s‚àí1 h‚Ä≤ s ‚àà H.
   Claim: œÅe is continuous. The map p : S √ó H ‚Üí G sending (s, t) 7‚Üí st is a continuous
surjection. Since both S and H are compact, p is a closed map so that G has the
quotient topology induced by p.

Then the continuity of œÅe follows from the universal property of the identification map p
since the composition œÅe ‚ó¶ p : S √ó H ‚Üí GL(n, C) sending (s, t) 7‚Üí œï(s)œÅ(t) is continuous.

Remark. In case that œÅ is irreducible, the condition (2) in Lemma 3.1 implies that œï
is a lifting homomorphism of the associated projective representation œÅ‚àó (defined in
the previous section) over S, i.e., œÄ ‚ó¶ œï = œÅ‚àó on S. On the other hand, any lifting
homomorphism œï of œÅ‚àó over S satisfies the condition (2).

   Our main concern in this paper is to study extensions of representations when G
is a compact Lie group and H is a closed normal subgroup of G such that G/H is
connected. In this case every complex representation œÅ of H is G-invariant. Indeed,
for each g ‚àà G, there is a continuous path gt in G from g to an element h ‚àà H since
every connected component of G contains an element of H. Then the path gt induces
a continuous family of conjugate representations gtœÅ so that all representations gtœÅ are
isomorphic (see [CF64, Lemma 38.1] for more general result). In particular, gœÅ = g0œÅ
and œÅ = hœÅ = g1œÅ are isomorphic.
   Let œÅ be a complex irreducible representation of H. Since œÅ is always G-invariant,
the associated projective representation œÅ‚àó exists by Lemma 2.1. To get a G-extension
of œÅ we shall first find a closed subgroup S of G such that G = SH, and then construct
a lifting homomorphism œï of œÅ‚àó over S (so that the condition (2) is satisfied). Finally
modifying œï a little to satisfy the condition (1) we may get a G-extension of œÅ.
Lemma 3.2. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such that
G/H ‚àº  = S 1 . Then there exists a circle subgroup S of G such that G = SH and S ‚à© H
is finite cyclic.
Proof. Let G0 denote the identity component of G. Since the canonical projection
p : G ‚Üí G/H is open and closed, p(G0 ) is a connected component of G/H so that
p(G0 ) = G/H. It is well known in Lie group theory [HM98, Theorem 6.15] that G0 =
Z0 G‚Ä≤0 , where Z0 is the identity component of the center of G0 , which is a torus and G‚Ä≤0
is the commutator subgroup of G0 . Then G‚Ä≤0 ‚äÇ G0 ‚à© H ‚äÇ H since G/H = G0 /(G0 ‚à© H)
6                  JIN-HWAN CHO, MIN KYU KIM, AND DONG YOUP SUH

is abelian, and thus p(Z0 ) = G/H. Using the isomorphism G/H ‚àº     = U(1) we may view
p|Z0 as a one-dimensional unitary representation of the torus Z0 . It is elementary in
representation theory that there exists a circle subgroup S ‚äÇ Z0 such that p(S) = G/H.
Therefore G = SH and, furthermore, the proper subgroup S ‚à© H of the circle group S
is finite cyclic.                                                                   
Lemma 3.3. Let T be a maximal torus in U(n). Then the exact sequence 0 ‚Üí S 1 ‚Üí
T ‚Üí T /S 1 ‚Üí 0 splits. Here S 1 is identified with the subgroup of U(n) consisting of
constant multiples zI for z ‚àà S 1 ‚äÇ C where I denotes the identity matrix.
Proof. Since any maximal torus T in U(n) is conjugate to the subgroup ‚àÜ(n) ‚äÇ U(n)
of diagonal matrices
                                           Ô£´           Ô£∂
                                            z1

                                                  .
                                                    zn
it suffices to show that the exact sequence 0 ‚Üí S 1 ‚Üí ‚àÜ(n) ‚Üí ‚àÜ(n)/S 1 ‚Üí 0 splits.
But the splitting is immediate because of the homomorphism ‚àÜ(n) ‚Üí S 1 mapping a
diagonal matrix D(z1 , . . . , zn ) to the constant multiple z1 I ‚àà S 1 .      
Proposition 3.4. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such
that G/H ‚àº
         = S 1 . Then every complex representation of H is extendible to G.
Proof. Let œÅ : H ‚Üí GL(n, C) be a given representation. Since H is compact, we may
assume that all the images of œÅ are contained in U(n) ‚äÇ GL(n, C). Moreover, it
is enough to prove the case that œÅ is irreducible. Since G/H ‚àº     = S 1 is connected, œÅ
is G-invariant so that the associated projective representation œÅ‚àó : G ‚Üí U(n)/S 1 ‚äÇ
PGL(n, C) = GL(n, C)/C‚àó exists by Lemma 2.1. From Lemma 3.2 we can choose a
circle subgroup S of G such that G = SH and S ‚à© H is finite cyclic.
   We shall find a lifting homomorphism œï0 : S ‚Üí U(n) of œÅ‚àó over S. Since œÅ‚àó (S) is
compact, connected, and abelian, it is a torus in U(n)/S 1 . Note that every maximal
torus in U(n)/S 1 has the form T /S 1 for some maximal torus T of U(n) [BtD85, The-
orem 2.9, Chapter IV]. Choose a maximal torus T of U(n) such that œÅ‚àó (S) ‚äÇ T /S 1 .
                                                  œÄ
By Lemma 3.3 the exact sequence 0 ‚Üí S 1 ‚Üí T ‚àí    ‚Üí T /S 1 ‚Üí 0 splits, i.e., the canonical
projection œÄ : T ‚Üí T /S 1 has a continuous section (homomorphism) s : T /S 1 ‚Üí T such
that the composition œÄ ‚ó¶ s is the identity map of T /S 1 . Then œï0 = s ‚ó¶ œÅ‚àó |S is a desired
lifting homomorphism of œÅ‚àó over S.

   Let t0 denote a generator of the finite cyclic group S ‚à© H. Since œÄ ‚ó¶ œï0 = œÅ‚àó = œÄ ‚ó¶ œÅ
on S ‚à© H, œï0 (t0 ) = ŒæœÅ(t0 ) for some constant Œæ ‚àà S 1 ‚äÇ C‚àó . Note that Œæ is an n-th root
of unity, where n is the order of S ‚à© H. So it is possible to choose a one-dimensional
unitary representation œÑ of the circle group S such that œÑ (t0 ) = Œæ ‚àí1 . Then the unitary
representation œï = œÑ ‚äó œï0 satisfies the conditions (1) and (2) in Lemma 3.1.            

Corollary 3.5. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such that
G/H is connected and abelian. Then every complex representation of H is extendible
to G.
Proof. Since G/H is compact, connected, and abelian, it is isomorphic to a torus. So
we have a finite chain of subgroups
                         H = H0 ‚ä≥ H1 ‚ä≥ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚ä≥ Hn‚àí1 ‚ä≥ Hn = G
such that Hi is normal in Hi+1 and Hi+1 /Hi ‚àº
                                            = S 1 . Applying Proposition 3.4 inductively,
any representation of H is extendible to G.                                            

                     4. Extensions when G/H is connected
  In this section we consider the general case, so G/H will be assumed to be connected
(not necessarily abelian). In this case the commutator subgroup (G/H)‚Ä≤ = G‚Ä≤ H/H of
G/H is semisimple connected [HM98, Theorem 6.18]. The following proposition reduces
the extension problem to the case that G/H is semisimple and connected.
Proposition 4.1. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup of G
such that G/H is connected. A complex representation of H is extendible to G if and
only if it is extendible to G‚Ä≤ H.
Proof. The necessity is obvious, and the sufficiency follows from Corollary 3.5 since the
factor group G/G‚Ä≤H ‚àº  = (G/H)/(G‚Ä≤H/H) = (G/H)/(G/H)‚Ä≤ is compact, connected, and
abelian, that is a torus.                                                              
  In the case that G/H is semisimple connected, the following result is well known in
Lie group theory (see for instance, [HM98, Proposition 6.14]).
Lemma 4.2. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such that
G/H is semisimple and connected. Then there is a semisimple connected closed normal
subgroup S in G such that G = SH and the map S √ó H ‚Üí G sending (s, h) 7‚Üí sh is a
homomorphism with a discrete kernel isomorphic to S ‚à© H.                         
Remark. Proposition 6.14 in [HM98] deals with the case when G is connected. However,
the same proof holds even if G is not connected, since G/H is connected. Moreover,
we can find the fact in the proof that S is semisimple and connected.
  The following result implies that the existence of a G-extension when G/H is semisim-
ple and connected is completely determined by the restriction of a given representation
to S ‚à© H.
Proposition 4.3. Under the hypotheses of Lemma 4.2, a complex irreducible represen-
tation œÅ of H is extendible to G if and only if œÅ is trivial on S ‚à© H, i.e., œÅ(g) = I, the
identity matrix, for all g ‚àà S ‚à© H.
Proof. It is immediate that S commutes with H, since the map S √ó H ‚Üí G sending
(s, h) 7‚Üí sh is a homomorphism. To prove the sufficiency, it is enough to choose the
trivial representation œï of S, i.e., œï(s) = I for all s ‚àà S. Since S commutes with H,
the two conditions (1) and (2) in Lemma 3.1 are satisfied immediately.
   On the other hand, suppose œÅe is a G-extension of œÅ. Since S commutes with H,
we have œÅe(s)‚àí1 œÅ(h)eœÅ(s) = œÅ(h) for all s ‚àà S and h ‚àà H. Then the Schur‚Äôs lemma
implies that œÅe(s) is constant for all s ‚àà S, so we may view the restriction œÅe|S as a
8                  JIN-HWAN CHO, MIN KYU KIM, AND DONG YOUP SUH

one-dimensional complex representation of S. Since semisimple Lie groups have no
nontrivial abelian factor group, the trivial representation is the unique one-dimensional
complex representation of S. Therefore, œÅe is trivial on S, in particular, on S ‚à© H. 
Remark. Note that the number of G-extensions (if exist) is exactly one, since every
G-extension should be trivial on S.
Corollary 4.4. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such
that G/H is semisimple and connected. Every complex representation of H is extendible
to G if and only if H is a direct summand of G, i.e., G ‚àº
                                                        = S √ó H for some subgroup S
of G.
Proof. The sufficiency is obvious so we prove the necessity. If H is not a direct summand
of G, then S ‚à© H in Lemma 4.2 contains a nontrivial element, say s0 . Since a faithful
representation of H always exists [BtD85, Theorem 4.1, Chapter III], we can choose an
irreducible sub-representation œÅ of H such that œÅ(s0 ) is not trivial. Then œÅ does not
extend to a representation of G by Proposition 4.3.                                     
  We shall now prove the main result in this paper. For the second statement of The-
orem 1.1, we need the following lemma giving a relation between the normal subgroup
S ‚à© H in Lemma 4.2 and the fundamental group of G/H.
Lemma 4.5. Under the hypotheses of Lemma 4.2, there exists a surjective homomor-
phism œÄ1 (G/H) ‚Üí S ‚à© H.
Proof. Since S/(S ‚à©H) = G/H, the restriction of the canonical projection p : G ‚Üí G/H
on S is surjective and its kernel S ‚à© H is discrete. It follows that p|S is a covering
homomorphism of G/H. From the uniqueness of the universal covering homomorphism
    ] ‚Üí G/H, there exists a covering homomorphism q : G/H
qe: G/H                                                      ] ‚Üí S such that the
diagram

                                    G/H       /S
                                                     }}
                                                  }}}
                                       qe       }}
                                           }~ } p|S
                                      G/H
commutes (compare with [HM98, Proposition 9.12]). Since S ‚à© H = ker p|S = q(ker qe)
and ker qe is isomorphic to œÄ1 (G/H), we have a surjective homomorphism of œÄ1 (G/H)
onto S ‚à© H.                                                                       
Theorem 1.1 (rephrased). Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal
subgroup such that G/H is connected. Then every complex representation of H is
extendible to G if and only if H is a direct summand of G‚Ä≤ H.
Proof. Since the factor group G‚Ä≤ H/H = (G/H)‚Ä≤ is semisimple and connected, the the-
orem follows immediately from Proposition 4.1 and Corollary 4.4.                 
Proof of Corollary 1.2. We claim that Tor(œÄ1 (G/H)), the torsion subgroup of œÄ1 (G/H),
is isomorphic to œÄ1 ((G/H)‚Ä≤ ). Denote by T the torus (G/H)/(G/H)‚Ä≤. Then the homo-
topy exact sequence of the fibration (G/H)‚Ä≤ ‚Üí G/H ‚Üí T implies that œÄ1 (G/H) ‚àº        =
œÄ1 ((G/H)‚Ä≤) ‚äï œÄ1 (T ), since the second homotopy group of a compact Lie group vanishes,
see [BtD85, Proposition 7.5, Chapter V]. Since (G/H)‚Ä≤ is semisimple, œÄ1 ((G/H)‚Ä≤ ) is
finite [BtD85, Remark 7.13, Chapter V] so that it is isomorphic to Tor(œÄ1 (G/H)) as
            ON EXTENSIONS OF REPRESENTATIONS FOR COMPACT LIE GROUPS                             9

we claimed. Therefore, the condition of œÄ1 (G/H) being torsion free is equivalent to
(G/H)‚Ä≤ being simply connected.
  By Lemma 4.2 and 4.5, G‚Ä≤ H = SH for some semisimple connected closed normal sub-
group S in G‚Ä≤ H and there is a surjective homomorphism œÄ1 (G‚Ä≤ H/H) = œÄ1 ((G/H)‚Ä≤) ‚Üí
S ‚à© H. Therefore, if (G/H)‚Ä≤ is simply connected, then œÄ1 ((G/H)‚Ä≤) = S ‚à© H = {e} so
that H is a direct summand of G‚Ä≤ H.                                               
