                                                    G/H is connected. This paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for every
                                                    complex representation of H to be extendible to G, and also for every complex G-

                                                    that the condition holds when the fundamental group of G/H is torsion free.

                                               One of the classical problems in finite group theory is to characterize extensions of
                                            representations. We mean an extension of a representation in the following way: Given
                                            a normal subgroup H of a group G, a (complex) representation ρ : H → GL(n, C) is
                                            called extendible to G if there exists a representation ρe: G → GL(n, C) (called a G-
                                            extension) such that ρ = ρe on H. It is to be noted that the dimension n is not changed,
                                            since ρ as a sub-representation is always contained in the restriction of the induced
                                            representation of ρ to H.
                                               In the case of finite G, it is well known that every complex irreducible representation of
                                            H, which is G-invariant under conjugation (see Section 2 for the definition), is extendible
                                            to G if the second group cohomology H 2 (G/H, C∗ ) vanishes [Isa76, Theorem 11.7].
                                            On the other hand the extension problem for infinite groups has not been extensively
                                            studied. In this article we study the problem for compact Lie groups when G/H is
                                            connected. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition for every complex
                                            representation of H to be extendible to G. It is also shown that the condition is related
                                            to a topological invariant, the fundamental group of G/H.
                                               For any group G, let G′ denote the commutator subgroup of G.

                                            that G/H is connected. Then every complex representation of H is extendible to G if
                                            and only if H is a direct summand of G′ H.

                                            that G/H is connected. Then every complex representation of H is extendible to G

if the fundamental group π1 (G/H) is torsion free, or equivalently if (G/H)′ is simply
connected.
   Our theorem provides a complete characterization of the triviality of complex G-
vector bundles over the homogeneous space G/H. Let E be a complex G-vector bundle
over G/H. We recall that E is trivial if it is isomorphic to the product bundle G/H ×V
for some complex G-module V . Since E is uniquely determined by the fiber at the
identity element of G/H (say E0 ), the bundle E is trivial if and only if E0 as a complex
representation of H is extendible to G. Theorem 1.1 leads us to the following corollary.
Corollary 1.3. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such
that G/H is connected. Then every complex G-vector bundle over the homogeneous
space G/H is trivial if and only if H is a direct summand of G′ H.           
   The existence of G-extensions plays an important role even in equivariant K-theory.
Let X be a connected topological space with a compact Lie group G action. Let H be
the normal subgroup of G which consists of all elements of G acting trivially on X. Then
the projection G → G/H induces the canonical homomorphism φ : KG/H (X) → KG (X)
which sends a G/H-vector bundle over X to the same bundle viewed as a G-vector
bundle with the trivial H-action.
   On the other hand, suppose that every complex irreducible representation of H is
extendible to G. Then there is an injective group homomorphism e : R(H) → R(G)
between two representation rings defined as follows. For each irreducible complex H-
module U choose a G-extension UG , and define e([U]) = [UG ] where [ ] denote the
classes in the representation rings. Then extend the definition of e to R(H) so that
it defines a homomorphism R(H) → R(G). For each complex G-module V we can
associate the trivial complex G-vector bundle V = X × V , which defines the natural
homomorphism t : R(G) → KG (X). We now define a group homomorphism
(1)         µ : R(H) ⊗ KG/H (X) → KG (X),          (V, ξ) 7→ t ◦ e(V ) ⊗ φ(ξ).
   This homomorphism is an isomorphism. Indeed, the inverse is given as follows. Let
Irr(H) denote the set of all isomorphism classes of complex irreducible representations
of H. For each [χ] ∈ Irr(H) choose a G-extension of χ, and let Vχ be the corresponding
G-module to the chosen G-extension. For a complex G-vector bundle E over X, the
canonical isomorphism
                               ∼
                               =
                                   M
                            E− →        Vχ ⊗ HomH (Vχ , E)
                                 [χ]∈Irr(H)

induces a group homomorphism KG (X) → R(H) ⊗ KG/H (X) which is the desired
inverse (see [CKMS99, Section 2] for more general arguments). Therefore we have a
generalization of Proposition 2.2 in [Seg68] which deals with the extreme case when G
acts trivially on X.
Corollary 1.4. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such
that G/H is connected. Let X be a connected G-space such that H acts trivially on X.
If H is a direct summand of G′ H, then the map µ : R(H) ⊗ KG/H (X) → KG (X) in (1)
can be defined, and it is a group isomorphism.                                    
  This article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we shall give some basic notions and
then show that a complex irreducible representation of H, which is G-invariant under
           ON EXTENSIONS OF REPRESENTATIONS FOR COMPACT LIE GROUPS                        3

conjugation, induces an associated projective representation of G which may be viewed
as a G-extension in the projective representation level. Section 3 is devoted to prove
that every complex representation of H has a G-extension when G/H is connected and
abelian. In Section 4 we shall proceed the study in the case that G/H is semisimple
and connected. After showing that the extension problem can be reduced to this case,
we shall prove Theorem 1.1.

                   2. Associated projective representations
   Let G be a topological group and H a closed normal subgroup of G. By a (com-
plex) representation of G we shall mean a continuous homomorphism of G into the
general linear group GL(n, C) of nonsingular n × n matrices over the field C of complex
numbers. A representation ρ : H → GL(n, C) is called extendible to G if there exists a
representation ρe: G → GL(n, C) (called a G-extension of ρ) such that ρ(h) = ρe(h) for
all h ∈ H.

                                   H      / GL(n, C)
                                             :
                                             ρe

                                     G
Moreover, it is enough to get a G-extension of ρ that there is a representation ρe: G →
GL(n, C) such that its restriction to H is isomorphic (or similar) to ρ, i.e., there exists
a matrix M ∈ GL(n, C) such that M −1 ρe(h)M = ρ(h) for all h ∈ H.
   Given a representation ρ : H → GL(n, C) the map gχ : H → C defined by the conju-
gation gχ(h) = χ(g −1 hg) becomes a representation of H for each g ∈ G. We say that ρ
is G-invariant if it is isomorphic to the conjugate representation gρ for all g ∈ G, which
is a necessary condition of ρ to be extendible to G.
  In the following we assume that a representation ρ : H → GL(n, C) is irreducible
and G-invariant. Then there exists a matrix Mg ∈ GL(n, C) for each g ∈ G such that
Mg−1 ρ(h)Mg = gρ(h) = ρ(g −1 hg) for all h ∈ H. Since ρ is irreducible, the Schur’s lemma
implies that Mg is unique up to multiplication by nonzero constant in C∗ = C \ {0}. So
we are able to define a function ρ∗ of G into the projective linear group PGL(n, C) =
GL(n, C)/C∗ by ρ∗ (g) = [Mg ] for each g ∈ G, where [Mg ] denotes the image of Mg by
the canonical projection π : GL(n, C) → PGL(n, C).

Lemma 2.1. Let G be a topological group and H a compact normal subgroup of G.
Given a complex irreducible representation ρ : H → GL(n, C) which is G-invariant, the
function ρ∗ : G → PGL(n, C) defined above is a continuous homomorphism, called the
projective representation of G associated with ρ. Moreover, the image of ρ∗ is contained
in U(n)/S 1 ⊂ PGL(n, C) if ρ is a unitary representation of H.

Proof. It is immediate that ρ∗ is a homomorphism. Since H is compact we may assume
that ρ is a unitary representation of H, i.e., the image of ρ is contained in the unitary
group U(n). Then Mg is a constant multiple of a matrix in U(n) so that ρ∗ (g) is
contained in U(n)/S 1 for all g ∈ G. For the continuity of ρ∗ it suffices to show that the
graph of ρ∗ in G × PGL(n, C) is closed, since U(n)/S 1 is a compact Hausdorff space.
  Consider the family of continuous maps Φh : G × GL(n, C) → GL(n, C) for each
h ∈ H given by (g, M) 7→ ρ(h)Mρ(g −1 hg)−1 M −1 . Then the set
              \            [

             h∈H           g∈G

is the inverse image of the graph of ρ∗ in G × PGL(n, C) by the canonical projection
1 × π : G × GL(n, C) → G × PGL(n, C), which is obviously closed in G × GL(n, C).
Therefore the graph of ρ∗ is also closed in G × PGL(n, C).                         
  We may say that ρ is extendible to G in the projective representation level, since
ρ (h) = [ρ(h)] for all h ∈ H, i.e., ρ∗ = π ◦ ρ on H.

                                        ρ∗

Note that any G-extension (if exists) ρe of ρ is a lifting homomorphism of ρ∗ , i.e.,
ρ∗ = π ◦ ρe, since ρ∗ (g) = [e
                             ρ(g)] for all g ∈ G.
Remark. In case that G is finite, choose a transversal T containing e for H in G and
set Me = I, the identity matrix in GL(n, C). For each t ∈ T and h ∈ H, the map
ρ′ : G → GL(n, C) sending th 7→ Mt ρ(h) is a lifting (not necessarily homomorphism)
of ρ∗ , i.e., π ◦ ρ′ = ρ∗ , and it determines a cocycle β in the second group cohomology
H 2 (G/H, C∗ ), which depends only on ρ. Moreover, ρ is extendible to G if and only if
β is trivial, see [Isa76, Theorem 11.7] for more details.

                3. Extensions when G/H is connected abelian
  In this section we shall prove that every complex representation of H is extendible
to G when G/H is compact, connected, and abelian, that is a torus. We begin with
a general result on extensions of representations in the special case when G = SH for
some closed subgroup S of G.
Lemma 3.1. Let G be a compact topological group such that G = SH for a closed
subgroup S and a closed normal subgroup H of G. Then a complex representation
ρ : H → GL(n, C) is extendible to G if and only if there exists a representation ϕ : S →
GL(n, C) such that
    (1) ϕ = ρ on S ∩ H, and
    (2) ϕ(s)−1 ρ(h)ϕ(s) = ρ(s−1 hs) for all s ∈ S and h ∈ H.
Proof. The necessity is obvious so we prove the sufficiency. Define a function ρe: G →
GL(n, C) by ρe(sh) = ϕ(s)ρ(h) for s ∈ S and h ∈ H. It is immediate that ρe = ρ
on H. In this proof we shall use the symbols s, s′ and h, h′ for elements in S and H,
respectively.
           ON EXTENSIONS OF REPRESENTATIONS FOR COMPACT LIE GROUPS                       5

  Claim: ρe is well-defined. If sh = s′ h′ ∈ G, then (s′ )−1 s = h′ h−1 ∈ S ∩ H. Then
the condition (1) implies that ϕ(s′ )−1 ϕ(s) = ρ(h′ )ρ(h)−1 and thus ρe(sh) = ϕ(s)ρ(h) =
ϕ(s′ )ρ(h′ ) = ρe(s′ h′ ).
  Claim: ρe is a homomorphism. For sh, s′ h′ ∈ G, the condition (2) implies that
                     ρe((s′ h′ )(sh)) = ϕ(s′ )ϕ(s)ρ(s−1 h′ s)ρ(h)
                                    = ϕ(s′ )ϕ(s)ϕ(s)−1 ρ(h′ )ϕ(s)ρ(h)
                                    = ρe(s′ h′ )e
                                                ρ(sh),
since (s′ h′ )(sh) = (s′ s)(s−1 h′ s)h and s−1 h′ s ∈ H.
   Claim: ρe is continuous. The map p : S × H → G sending (s, t) 7→ st is a continuous
surjection. Since both S and H are compact, p is a closed map so that G has the
quotient topology induced by p.

                                     G          / GL(n, C)

Then the continuity of ρe follows from the universal property of the identification map p
since the composition ρe ◦ p : S × H → GL(n, C) sending (s, t) 7→ ϕ(s)ρ(t) is continuous.
                                                                                       
Remark. In case that ρ is irreducible, the condition (2) in Lemma 3.1 implies that ϕ
is a lifting homomorphism of the associated projective representation ρ∗ (defined in
the previous section) over S, i.e., π ◦ ϕ = ρ∗ on S. On the other hand, any lifting
homomorphism ϕ of ρ∗ over S satisfies the condition (2).

   Our main concern in this paper is to study extensions of representations when G
is a compact Lie group and H is a closed normal subgroup of G such that G/H is
connected. In this case every complex representation ρ of H is G-invariant. Indeed,
for each g ∈ G, there is a continuous path gt in G from g to an element h ∈ H since
every connected component of G contains an element of H. Then the path gt induces
a continuous family of conjugate representations gtρ so that all representations gtρ are
isomorphic (see [CF64, Lemma 38.1] for more general result). In particular, gρ = g0ρ
and ρ = hρ = g1ρ are isomorphic.
   Let ρ be a complex irreducible representation of H. Since ρ is always G-invariant,
the associated projective representation ρ∗ exists by Lemma 2.1. To get a G-extension
of ρ we shall first find a closed subgroup S of G such that G = SH, and then construct
a lifting homomorphism ϕ of ρ∗ over S (so that the condition (2) is satisfied). Finally
modifying ϕ a little to satisfy the condition (1) we may get a G-extension of ρ.
Lemma 3.2. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such that
G/H ∼  = S 1 . Then there exists a circle subgroup S of G such that G = SH and S ∩ H
is finite cyclic.
Proof. Let G0 denote the identity component of G. Since the canonical projection
p : G → G/H is open and closed, p(G0 ) is a connected component of G/H so that
p(G0 ) = G/H. It is well known in Lie group theory [HM98, Theorem 6.15] that G0 =
Z0 G′0 , where Z0 is the identity component of the center of G0 , which is a torus and G′0
is the commutator subgroup of G0 . Then G′0 ⊂ G0 ∩ H ⊂ H since G/H = G0 /(G0 ∩ H)
6                  JIN-HWAN CHO, MIN KYU KIM, AND DONG YOUP SUH

is abelian, and thus p(Z0 ) = G/H. Using the isomorphism G/H ∼     = U(1) we may view
p|Z0 as a one-dimensional unitary representation of the torus Z0 . It is elementary in
representation theory that there exists a circle subgroup S ⊂ Z0 such that p(S) = G/H.
Therefore G = SH and, furthermore, the proper subgroup S ∩ H of the circle group S
is finite cyclic.                                                                   
Lemma 3.3. Let T be a maximal torus in U(n). Then the exact sequence 0 → S 1 →
T → T /S 1 → 0 splits. Here S 1 is identified with the subgroup of U(n) consisting of
constant multiples zI for z ∈ S 1 ⊂ C where I denotes the identity matrix.
Proof. Since any maximal torus T in U(n) is conjugate to the subgroup ∆(n) ⊂ U(n)
of diagonal matrices
                                                      
                                            z1
                     D(z1 , . . . , zn ) =    ..       , zi ∈ S 1 ,
                                                  .
                                                    zn
it suffices to show that the exact sequence 0 → S 1 → ∆(n) → ∆(n)/S 1 → 0 splits.
But the splitting is immediate because of the homomorphism ∆(n) → S 1 mapping a
diagonal matrix D(z1 , . . . , zn ) to the constant multiple z1 I ∈ S 1 .      
Proposition 3.4. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such
that G/H ∼
         = S 1 . Then every complex representation of H is extendible to G.
Proof. Let ρ : H → GL(n, C) be a given representation. Since H is compact, we may
assume that all the images of ρ are contained in U(n) ⊂ GL(n, C). Moreover, it
is enough to prove the case that ρ is irreducible. Since G/H ∼     = S 1 is connected, ρ
is G-invariant so that the associated projective representation ρ∗ : G → U(n)/S 1 ⊂
PGL(n, C) = GL(n, C)/C∗ exists by Lemma 2.1. From Lemma 3.2 we can choose a
circle subgroup S of G such that G = SH and S ∩ H is finite cyclic.
   We shall find a lifting homomorphism ϕ0 : S → U(n) of ρ∗ over S. Since ρ∗ (S) is
compact, connected, and abelian, it is a torus in U(n)/S 1 . Note that every maximal
torus in U(n)/S 1 has the form T /S 1 for some maximal torus T of U(n) [BtD85, The-
orem 2.9, Chapter IV]. Choose a maximal torus T of U(n) such that ρ∗ (S) ⊂ T /S 1 .
                                                  π
By Lemma 3.3 the exact sequence 0 → S 1 → T −    → T /S 1 → 0 splits, i.e., the canonical
projection π : T → T /S 1 has a continuous section (homomorphism) s : T /S 1 → T such
that the composition π ◦ s is the identity map of T /S 1 . Then ϕ0 = s ◦ ρ∗ |S is a desired
lifting homomorphism of ρ∗ over S.

   Let t0 denote a generator of the finite cyclic group S ∩ H. Since π ◦ ϕ0 = ρ∗ = π ◦ ρ
on S ∩ H, ϕ0 (t0 ) = ξρ(t0 ) for some constant ξ ∈ S 1 ⊂ C∗ . Note that ξ is an n-th root
of unity, where n is the order of S ∩ H. So it is possible to choose a one-dimensional
unitary representation τ of the circle group S such that τ (t0 ) = ξ −1 . Then the unitary
representation ϕ = τ ⊗ ϕ0 satisfies the conditions (1) and (2) in Lemma 3.1.            

Corollary 3.5. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such that
G/H is connected and abelian. Then every complex representation of H is extendible
to G.
Proof. Since G/H is compact, connected, and abelian, it is isomorphic to a torus. So
we have a finite chain of subgroups
                         H = H0 ⊳ H1 ⊳ · · · ⊳ Hn−1 ⊳ Hn = G
such that Hi is normal in Hi+1 and Hi+1 /Hi ∼
                                            = S 1 . Applying Proposition 3.4 inductively,
any representation of H is extendible to G.                                            

                     4. Extensions when G/H is connected
  In this section we consider the general case, so G/H will be assumed to be connected
(not necessarily abelian). In this case the commutator subgroup (G/H)′ = G′ H/H of
G/H is semisimple connected [HM98, Theorem 6.18]. The following proposition reduces
the extension problem to the case that G/H is semisimple and connected.
Proposition 4.1. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup of G
such that G/H is connected. A complex representation of H is extendible to G if and
only if it is extendible to G′ H.
Proof. The necessity is obvious, and the sufficiency follows from Corollary 3.5 since the
factor group G/G′H ∼  = (G/H)/(G′H/H) = (G/H)/(G/H)′ is compact, connected, and
abelian, that is a torus.                                                              
  In the case that G/H is semisimple connected, the following result is well known in
Lie group theory (see for instance, [HM98, Proposition 6.14]).
Lemma 4.2. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such that
G/H is semisimple and connected. Then there is a semisimple connected closed normal
subgroup S in G such that G = SH and the map S × H → G sending (s, h) 7→ sh is a
homomorphism with a discrete kernel isomorphic to S ∩ H.                         
Remark. Proposition 6.14 in [HM98] deals with the case when G is connected. However,
the same proof holds even if G is not connected, since G/H is connected. Moreover,
we can find the fact in the proof that S is semisimple and connected.
  The following result implies that the existence of a G-extension when G/H is semisim-
ple and connected is completely determined by the restriction of a given representation
to S ∩ H.
Proposition 4.3. Under the hypotheses of Lemma 4.2, a complex irreducible represen-
tation ρ of H is extendible to G if and only if ρ is trivial on S ∩ H, i.e., ρ(g) = I, the
identity matrix, for all g ∈ S ∩ H.
Proof. It is immediate that S commutes with H, since the map S × H → G sending
(s, h) 7→ sh is a homomorphism. To prove the sufficiency, it is enough to choose the
trivial representation ϕ of S, i.e., ϕ(s) = I for all s ∈ S. Since S commutes with H,
the two conditions (1) and (2) in Lemma 3.1 are satisfied immediately.
   On the other hand, suppose ρe is a G-extension of ρ. Since S commutes with H,
we have ρe(s)−1 ρ(h)eρ(s) = ρ(h) for all s ∈ S and h ∈ H. Then the Schur’s lemma
implies that ρe(s) is constant for all s ∈ S, so we may view the restriction ρe|S as a
8                  JIN-HWAN CHO, MIN KYU KIM, AND DONG YOUP SUH

one-dimensional complex representation of S. Since semisimple Lie groups have no
nontrivial abelian factor group, the trivial representation is the unique one-dimensional
complex representation of S. Therefore, ρe is trivial on S, in particular, on S ∩ H. 
Remark. Note that the number of G-extensions (if exist) is exactly one, since every
G-extension should be trivial on S.
Corollary 4.4. Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal subgroup such
that G/H is semisimple and connected. Every complex representation of H is extendible
to G if and only if H is a direct summand of G, i.e., G ∼
                                                        = S × H for some subgroup S
of G.
Proof. The sufficiency is obvious so we prove the necessity. If H is not a direct summand
of G, then S ∩ H in Lemma 4.2 contains a nontrivial element, say s0 . Since a faithful
representation of H always exists [BtD85, Theorem 4.1, Chapter III], we can choose an
irreducible sub-representation ρ of H such that ρ(s0 ) is not trivial. Then ρ does not
extend to a representation of G by Proposition 4.3.                                     
  We shall now prove the main result in this paper. For the second statement of The-
orem 1.1, we need the following lemma giving a relation between the normal subgroup
S ∩ H in Lemma 4.2 and the fundamental group of G/H.
Lemma 4.5. Under the hypotheses of Lemma 4.2, there exists a surjective homomor-
phism π1 (G/H) → S ∩ H.
Proof. Since S/(S ∩H) = G/H, the restriction of the canonical projection p : G → G/H
on S is surjective and its kernel S ∩ H is discrete. It follows that p|S is a covering
homomorphism of G/H. From the uniqueness of the universal covering homomorphism
    ] → G/H, there exists a covering homomorphism q : G/H
qe: G/H                                                      ] → S such that the
diagram

                                    G/H       /S
                                                     }}
                                                  }}}
                                       qe       }}
                                           }~ } p|S
                                      G/H
commutes (compare with [HM98, Proposition 9.12]). Since S ∩ H = ker p|S = q(ker qe)
and ker qe is isomorphic to π1 (G/H), we have a surjective homomorphism of π1 (G/H)
onto S ∩ H.                                                                       
Theorem 1.1 (rephrased). Let G be a compact Lie group and H a closed normal
subgroup such that G/H is connected. Then every complex representation of H is
extendible to G if and only if H is a direct summand of G′ H.
Proof. Since the factor group G′ H/H = (G/H)′ is semisimple and connected, the the-
orem follows immediately from Proposition 4.1 and Corollary 4.4.                 
Proof of Corollary 1.2. We claim that Tor(π1 (G/H)), the torsion subgroup of π1 (G/H),
is isomorphic to π1 ((G/H)′ ). Denote by T the torus (G/H)/(G/H)′. Then the homo-
topy exact sequence of the fibration (G/H)′ → G/H → T implies that π1 (G/H) ∼        =
π1 ((G/H)′) ⊕ π1 (T ), since the second homotopy group of a compact Lie group vanishes,
see [BtD85, Proposition 7.5, Chapter V]. Since (G/H)′ is semisimple, π1 ((G/H)′ ) is
finite [BtD85, Remark 7.13, Chapter V] so that it is isomorphic to Tor(π1 (G/H)) as
            ON EXTENSIONS OF REPRESENTATIONS FOR COMPACT LIE GROUPS                             9

we claimed. Therefore, the condition of π1 (G/H) being torsion free is equivalent to
(G/H)′ being simply connected.
  By Lemma 4.2 and 4.5, G′ H = SH for some semisimple connected closed normal sub-
group S in G′ H and there is a surjective homomorphism π1 (G′ H/H) = π1 ((G/H)′) →
S ∩ H. Therefore, if (G/H)′ is simply connected, then π1 ((G/H)′) = S ∩ H = {e} so
that H is a direct summand of G′ H.                                               
