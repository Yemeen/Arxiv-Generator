          1. Introduction and discussion of the main results

     I. Introduction. Throughout the last two or three decades, the theory of
rigidity, particularly in relation to semisimple groups and their discrete sub-
groups, has become an extremely active mathematical field, where tools from
diverse areas are simultaneously being employed. In retrospect, it seems that
two major achievements in the early 70’s have set up somewhat parallel direc-
tions in which the theory emerged. These were Mostow’s theorem, which, at
least in its original form, was concerned with strong rigidity of lattices in rank
one Lie groups, and Margulis’ theorem, pertaining to the superrigidity of lat-
tices in higher rank groups. Mostow’s proof, and the theory which followed his
result, are mainly geometric, making a strong use of the hyperbolicity phenom-
enon in its various forms. The theory of quasi-isometries, negatively curved
manifolds (and groups), and the abstract generalization to CAT(-1) spaces,
which were deeply pursued by Gromov and his successors, may be viewed as
far-reaching developments of Mostow’s fundamental ideas. Margulis’ theorem,
on the other hand, initiated what is now called the (algebraic) ergodic theory of
semisimple groups. Zimmer’s cocycle superrigidity theorem with its numerous
applications, and the work of many others, developed Margulis’ ideas to create
a striking theory for higher rank groups, and particularly a “nonlinear” finite
dimensional rigidity theory. Although drawing on many geometric techniques,
this theory relies primarily on measure and ergodic theoretic tools.
     A glance at the statement of Mostow-Margulis theorems may hint at the
nature of the theories. While an assumption of faithfulness or discreteness on
the homomorphism of the lattice is a typical feature of the rank one theory,
and owes much to its geometric methods, in the higher rank case one usually
aims to get sharp rigidity under extremely weak conditions. Of course, this
is hardly a shortcoming of the methods, as it is well-known that the groups
SO(n, 1) and SU(n, 1) fail to have many of the rigidity properties shared by
the higher rank groups. It should be mentioned, however, that thanks to the
well-known results of Corlette and Gromov-Schoen, the rank one Lie groups
Sp(n, 1) and F4(−20) do exhibit remarkable rigidity phenomena (see also [Pa]),
even if they do not enjoy many of the methods and results the higher rank
theory can offer.
     In this paper, we attempt to bring closer the rank one and the higher
rank theories, in addressing some rigidity questions for the groups SO(n, 1),
SU(n, 1), which are motivated by, and mostly answered in, the higher rank
theory. Before elaborating on the precise details, let us describe briefly three
examples, which together may help to put our results in a better perspective.
     Recall that every isometric action of a higher rank (irreducible) lattice
on a tree, fixes a vertex (in most cases this follows from property (T)). For
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       115

lattices in SO(n, 1) this is well-known not be the case. However, we will show
that the ambient group does impose a strong limitation on such actions, and
even if these lattices need not admit a global fixed vertex, “large” subgroups
of them always do. Next, the normal subgroup structure of higher rank lat-
tices, being known to be “trivial” (due to Margulis), is completely analyzed.
In particular, the issue of noninjective homomorphisms of them never arises.
On the other hand, uniform lattices in rank one groups are word hyperbolic,
hence by Gromov’s theory, admit many normal subgroups. Actually, some of
these lattices are known to surject onto a nonabelian free group, a fact which
hardly encourages attempts to study general noninjective homomorphisms. We
will nevertheless explore some nonfaithful (discrete) linear representations of
these lattices, and show that the algebraic normal subgroup structure is indeed
subject to some geometric constraints. Finally, Zimmer applied his cocycle su-
perrigidiy theorem, making use of a deep theorem of Gromov, to show that a
fundamental group of a compact manifold on which a higher rank group acts,
preserving some geometric structure, must be, roughly speaking, at least as big
as the group acting. We will show a similar phenomenon taking place when
the group acting is SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1), relying on a stronger consequence of
Gromov’s work. In light of the existence of free quotients of lattices, construc-
tions of compact manifolds on which the ambient group acts are quite flexible
(using suspension), making such results less expected in general. Our rigidity
theorem (see 1.2, 1.3 below) serves here as a bridge, extending both Zimmer’s
work to the rank one setting, and a result on rank one lattices, due to Yue and
Bourdon (see Theorem 1.1 below). While the method we suggest is new, the
treatment, using cocycles and the framework of principal bundles, is directly
influenced by Zimmer’s approach.
      The proofs of our results are based heavily, in a new fashion, on unitary
representations of semisimple groups, and their cohomology. Although the
discussion so far highlights the rigidity aspects, in order to approach these,
we prove some results in the representation theory of SO(n, 1) and SU(n, 1),
which seem of independent interest. Somewhat surprisingly, it will become
evident that the reason for the absence of many rigidity phenomena in these
groups, particularly, their failure to have property (T) of Kazhdan, is our
main source of strength, being intimately related to the methods we develop.
In fact, as far as the subject of asymptotics of matrix coefficients is concerned,
we remain with a better understanding of the groups SO(n, 1) and SU(n, 1)
than the higher rank groups, and here it is not clear to us whether this has
to do only with our approach. (The other rank one simple Lie groups seem to
fall, once again, in the middle.) We shall return to elaborate on this matter
after describing more fully the main results.

    II. Statement of the main results. Hereafter, unless specified otherwise, G
denotes a simple Lie group with finite center, (locally) isomorphic to SO(n, 1)
with n ≥ 3, or SU(n, 1) with n ≥ 2 (that is, SL2 (R) is excluded through-
out this section), and K < G denotes a maximal compact subgroup. We fix
the G-invariant Riemannian metric d on G/K, normalized to have constant
(maximal) −1 sectional curvature when G = SO(n, 1) (SU(n, 1), resp.). This
makes the natural equivariant embeddings of the different symmetric spaces,
one in the other, isometric. Fix also once and for all the K-invariant point
o = ē ∈ G/K as an “origin” for all the spaces (we may view them all em-
bedded, say, in some SU(n, 1)/K for a large n). Recall the notion of critical
exponent δ, of a discrete subgroup Λ < G, which will play a central role in the
sequel, providing a natural geometric measurement of the size of a subgroup:

                                             e−sd(λo,o) < ∞}.
                                       P
      1.0 Definition. δ(Λ) = inf{s |
                                       λ∈Λ


     Note that δ(Λ) does not depend on the ambient group G, in the sense
that if Λ < G1 < G2 , where G1 < G2 is a natural inclusion, then its value is
the same whether we regard Λ as a subgroup of G1 or G2 . Some well-known
properties of δ to be used, are found in Lemma 2.7 below. We only recall here
that if Γ is a lattice in G = SO(n, 1) (n ≥ 3), then δ(Γ) = n − 1 (a value which
we assign, for the time being by formal notation, also to δ(G)), while if Γ is a
lattice in G = SU(n, 1) (n ≥ 2), then δ(Γ) = 2n (= δ(G), as before).
    1.1 Theorem. Let Γ < G be a lattice, and ϕ : Γ → Λ be an isomorphism
of Γ with a discrete subgroup Λ of some H = SO(m, 1) or SU(m, 1). Then
δ(Γ) ≤ δ(Λ).

     Theorem 1.1 extends a result proved in [Yue], where Λ is assumed geomet-
rically finite. In [Yue] and [Bou1] the case of equality is studied, which leads to
a beautiful superrigidity theorem in this case. After this work was completed,
G. Besson, G. Courtois and S. Gallot drew our attention to their recent paper,
in which the result of Bourdon and Yue is strengthened, and the assumption
on Λ removed as well (see [BCG, 1.15]). Yet, in all of the aforementioned pa-
pers, the lattice Γ is assumed to be uniform, an assumption which is relaxed in
Theorem 1.1. Two of our main results present generalizations of this theorem,
each in a different direction.
     The first direction in which Theorem 1.1 can be extended, concerns uni-
form lattices Γ, viewed as (essentially) the fundamental group of the compact
G-space G/Γ. Let G be a connected Lie group, and suppose it acts contin-
uously on a compact manifold M . Then standard covering space arguments
show that the universal covering G̃ of G acts naturally on the universal cover-
ing M̃ of M . Although we are interested in both families of groups SO(n, 1)
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                         117

and SU(n, 1), the fact that the fundamental group of those in the second family
is infinite, makes the formulation of our next result a little more technical for
them. For simplicity, we discuss here only G = SO(n, 1) (n > 2).

     1.2 Theorem. With the above notation and assumptions on G and M ,
suppose that the G-action on M preserves a finite measure, and that the action
of G̃ on M̃ is measurably proper with respect to the natural lift of the invariant
measure. That is, for almost all x ∈ M̃ the stabilizer Gx is compact, and the
orbital map g → gx from G̃/G̃x to M̃ , is proper. If π1 (M ) is isomorphic to a
discrete infinite subgroup Λ of H = SO(m, 1) or SU(m, 1) (for some m), then
δ(G) ≤ δ(Λ).

     A simple example of a situation where the condition in Theorem 1.2 holds
is when there is at least one element g ∈ G̃ which acts properly discontinuously
on M̃ . (This is an easy consequence of the Cartan decomposition, and the rank
one property.) Gromov’s work on rigid transformation groups, [Gr2], [Zi2, 4.5],
provides another general geometric situation in which this condition is satisfied:

     1.3 Corollary. Let G be locally isomorphic to SO(n, 1) for n ≥ 3.
     (i) Suppose that the G-action on M is real analytic and preserves volume
and a rigid (analytic) geometric structure in the sense of Gromov [Gr2] (this
includes Cartan’s classical notion of a structure of finite type, e.g., a pseudo-
Riemannian metric or an affine connection). If π1 (M ) is infinite, and embeds
discretely in SO(m, 1) or SU(m, 1), then δ(G) ≤ δ(π1 (M )).
     (ii) In particular, in the situation of (i) above, if π1 (M ) is embedded as an
infinite, geometrically finite subgroup, in the same Lie group G, then it must
be a lattice there.

     Thus, SO(n, 1) cannot act real analytically on a compact manifold M ,
preserving volume and a connection, if π1 (M ) is infinite and embeds discretely
in SO(n−1, 1). This type of result holds also when G = SU(n, 1); however here
one has to take into account the possible embedding of the (infinite) center of
G̃ in π1 (M ). We will take up this technicality in Section 7.II, where the proof
is presented (see Theorem 7.1 and the preceding discussion).
     As mentioned earlier, Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.3 were motivated by
results of Zimmer in the higher rank case, which, although similar in spirit, are
much sharper (see e.g. the account in [Zi2] and the references therein). The
superrigidity for cocycles, in conjunction with Ratner’s theorem, yields striking
consequences, which are simply not valid in our case. We remark that while
in Zimmer’s work, Gromov’s theorem was applied to verify a mild “engaging”
condition, we rely on its being stronger, to obtain the fastest possible decay
of the matrix coefficients for the G-representation on L2 (M̃ ). It may also be
interesting to mention that part (ii) in Corollary 1.3 is now established for
118                              YEHUDA SHALOM


all simple Lie groups excluding SL2 (R). The higher rank case, as mentioned,
follows from Zimmer’s work (see [Zi2, §5]); the case of Sp(n, 1) and F4(−20)
from a weaker version of the cocycle superrigidity theorem, established by
Zimmer and Corlette via harmonic maps technique [CZ, Theorem 4.2] (and by
application of Ratner’s theorem in an argument identical to that in [Zi2]). The
remaining groups are taken care of above (they are the only ones for which an
additional geometric assumption on the image is currently required).
      A different way in which Theorem 1.1 may be generalized is by considering
also noninjective homomorphisms. There seem to be few known results in this
situation.

     1.4 Theorem. With the assumptions and notation of Theorem 1.1, and
with ϕ noninjective as well, the following inequality holds:
                                       δ(Γ)          δ(ϕ(Γ))
(1)            δ(Γ) ≤ max{δ(Ker ϕ),         } + max{         , 1}.
                                         2              2

     For instance, if δ(ϕ(Γ)) < 2 (e.g., ϕ(Γ) is a free group), one necessarily
has δ(Ker ϕ) ≥ δ(Γ) − 1 (actually, strict inequality must hold; see Theorem 5.6
below). We do not know if inequality (1) is tight in a way more interesting
than the fact that equality holds when ϕ extends to G. In fact, we believe that
equality occurs exactly in that case (see §8.3 below for a further discussion).
Indeed, a more symmetric expression on the right-hand side of (1) might be
expected, one which resembles better the sum of δ on the kernel and the image.
The appearance of 2 in the denominator has its origins (in the proof), in the
special role played by the regular (=L2 ) representation. Nevertheless, one
should keep in mind the following:

     Observation. For every n ≥ 2 there exists a lattice Γ < SO(n, 1), and
some α < δ(Γ), such that the following holds: for every ε > 0 one can find
ϕ : Γ → Γ with δ(Ker ϕ) < α and δ(ϕ(Γ)) < ε.

      This is explained after the proof of Theorem 1.4, in Section 7.I. We note
that by a result in [BJ], the critical exponent may be replaced (here, as in all of
our results) by the Hausdorff dimension of the radial limit set. Notice however,
that measuring the full limit set is too crude for our purposes, as the latter is
the whole boundary for any infinite normal subgroup of a lattice, whereas the
critical exponent of such a subgroup strictly decreases if the quotient by the
lattice is nonamenable (see the last paragraph of §7.I).
      A result in a more general geometric framework is the following:

      1.5 Theorem. Let Λ be a finitely generated nonamenable group, whose
first ℓ2 -Betti number vanishes. Then for any discrete faithful representation
of Λ into SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1), the image has critical exponent at least 2.
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       119

Moreover, in case of equality, the image must be of divergent type (that is, the
series in Definition 1.0 diverges at s = 2).

     Note that by Sullivan’s work [Su1], the additional information in case of
equality is of interest. The result itself is tight, as can be seen by lattices in
SL2 (C). There are various families of groups to which Theorem 1.5 applies,
such as fundamental groups of closed Kähler manifolds (which are not commen-
surable to a surface group). See Section 4.III for more examples, applications
and references.

     1.6 Theorem. Let Γ < G be as in Theorem 1.1, and suppose that Γ acts
by isometries on a (simplicial) tree T , without a fixed vertex. Then there exists
an edge in T , whose stabilizer C < Γ satisfies δ(C) ≥ δ(Γ) − 1. Furthermore,
if G = SU(n, 1), or if the tree T is locally finite and G 6= SO(3, 1), then for
some edge stabilizer C, strict inequality must hold.
     In particular, if Γ = A ∗C B is a free product of its subgroups A and B,
over the amalgamated subgroup C, then δ(C) ≥ δ(Γ) − 1, and strict inequality
holds if G = SU(n, 1), or if G 6= SO(3, 1) and [A : C] < ∞, [B : C] < ∞.

     Notice that we do not assume any kind of geometric condition on the
action, or the stabilizers. The bound for SO(n, 1) is sharp, as is best seen in
the constructions of nonarithmetic lattices by Gromov and Piatetski-Shapiro
[GPS], which admit a splitting where the amalgamated subgroup C is a lattice
in SO(n − 1, 1). The strengthening to strict inequality relies, in the case of
SU(n, 1), also on a result of Gromov and Schoen [GS] using harmonic maps. In
both cases this sharpening depends on an additional detailed spectral analysis,
providing support to our belief that equality δ(C) = δ(Γ) − 1 comes only from
geometric constructions of splittings of Γ (see also §8.2 below). Notice also
that some lattices in SO(n, 1) do admit actions on locally finite trees, e.g.,
those coming from a homomorphism onto a nonabelian free group.
     A different application of our methods concerns the well-known problem
of existence of compact quotients for homogeneous spaces. This problem has
been addressed using numerous techniques, each providing a solution to some
families of groups. Amongst the contributions in the last decade, we men-
tion those of Kobayashi, Labourie, Mozes and Zimmer (see [La] for a survey),
and more recently, those of Benoist [Be] and Margulis-Oh ([Mar1], [Oh]). The
analysis of Margulis and Oh also uses decay estimates on matrix coefficients,
but in a way completely different from the one we suggest. Our approach illus-
trates another example of a “rank one result”, inspired by Zimmer’s “higher
rank treatment” of the question. Both the formulation and the proof of the
theorem are more convenient in the framework of discrete subgroups.

     1.7 Theorem. Let G be a simple Lie group with finite center, and Λ < G
be a discrete infinite subgroup which admits a discrete embedding in SO(n, 1) or
SU(n, 1) for some n. Assume that there exists a nonamenable closed subgroup
L < G, with noncompact center, which commutes with Λ. Then G/Λ admits
no compact quotients; i.e., there is no discrete subgroup Γ < G which acts
properly discontinuously on G/Λ, with a bounded fundamental domain.
     For example, a situation, where Theorem 1.7 applies naturally, is the
following (compare with Zimmer’s questions in [Zi3], and with [LZ]):
    Corollary. If G = SLn (R), n ≥ 4, and H = SL2 (R) < G is embedded
naturally in the upper left corner, then G/H admits no compact quotients. The
same is true if R is replaced by C.
    Replacing SL2 (R) by a discrete co-compact subgroup Λ, one indeed re-
duces the corollary to Theorem 1.7 (observing that L ∼
                                                     = GL2 (R) can be taken
in Theorem 1.7).
     III. The approach. To describe our approach, we shall first need to discuss
further results and notions. Recall that if G is a locally compact group, and
π is a continuous unitary G-representation on the Hilbert space H, then π is
called strongly Lp , if for a dense subspace H0 ⊂ H, the matrix coefficients
g → hπ(g)u, vi belong to Lp+ǫ (G) for all ǫ > 0, for all u, v ∈ H0 (in most
examples we shall encounter, the matrix coefficients need not be in Lp (G); see
§2.II for further discussion). We note that for notational convenience, we allow
here any value 0 ≤ p ≤ ∞, although standard properties of Lp -spaces will be
used only for p ≥ 1 (all unitary representations are strongly L∞ ).
     Independently, as with all G-modules, one has the usual notion of (con-
tinuous) first cohomology for a unitary G-representation, denoted by H 1 (see
Definition 3.1 below). Keeping this in mind, we introduce the following invari-
ant, which plays a key role in the present paper:
    1.8 Definition. For a locally compact group G, let p = p(G) denote the
value:
p(G) = inf{0 ≤ p ≤ ∞| there exists some continuous unitary G-representation
                        π which is strongly Lp , and satisfies H 1 (G, π) 6= 0}.

     If G has no representation π with H 1 (G, π) 6= 0 (i.e., G is Kazhdan),
set p(G) = ∞ (other groups may satisfy p(G) = ∞ as well). On the other
extreme, we shall see that once p(G) < 2, then actually p(G) = 0, which
is equivalent to having nonvanishing of the first cohomology with coefficients
in the regular representation. In the class of finitely generated groups, the
latter occurs precisely for groups which are either amenable, or have nonzero
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                        121

first ℓ2 -Betti number, such as free groups (see Theorem 4.3). For the groups
G = SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1) and their lattices, we shall establish the following result:

     1.9 Theorem. If Γ < G is a lattice, then p(G) = p(Γ) = δ(Γ)(= δ(G)),
as long as G is not locally isomorphic to SL2 (R). In the latter case, p(G) =
p(Γ) = 0.

     See Definition 1.0 for the notation and the numerical values of δ. Notice
that this invariant shows, in particular, that lattices in different SO(n, 1)’s,
say, can be distinguished by their representation theory (one which is far from
being understood in any reasonable sense).
     The computation of p(Γ) when Γ is uniform is an easy consequence of the
computation of p(G) (to which we shall shortly return), using a restriction-
induction argument. The situation is different when Γ is nonuniform, as
here one does not have in general an isomorphism between H ∗ (Γ, π) and
H ∗ (G, IndG
           Γ π). Similar subtle issues, concerning cohomology of nonuniform
lattices, were studied mainly by Borel (see [Bor] and the references therein).
Here we confine to the first cohomology, but need all unitary (possibly infinite
dimensional) Γ-representations. This question and our approach to it are dif-
ferent, and fortunately we are able to establish the following result, which is
essential for the whole treatment of nonuniform lattices in this paper:

     1.10 Theorem. Assume G ∼  = SO(n, 1) with n ≥ 4, or G ∼    = SU(n, 1)
with n ≥ 2. Let Γ < G be a (nonuniform) lattice, and let π be some unitary
Γ-representation. Then:
(2)                        H 1 (Γ, π) ∼
                                      = H 1 (G, IndG
                                                   Γ π).


      For the groups excluded in the theorem (which are locally isomorphic to
SL2 (R) or SL2 (C)), we were informed by John Millson that (2) can indeed
fail, when π is the trivial representation. Our proof of Theorem 1.10 reduces
to a question which is independent of π, concerning the convergence of some
integral over G/Γ. The question is essentially a geometric one, and relies on
the structure and precise behavior of the cusps of G/Γ. The convergence of the
integral is crucial in order for a map from the left- to the right-hand side in (2)
to be well-defined. We remark that a similar divergence problem invalidates
the proof of Raghunathan’s local rigidity theorem [Ra] for the nonuniform
lattices in SL2 (C), a result which is indeed false in general. As in [GR, §8],
where a substitute for local rigidity was found in this special case, an ad hoc
argument is available here, using first ℓ2 -Betti numbers, to show that p(Γ) = 2
when Γ < SL2 (C). We also note that in [Sh2], Theorem 1.10 is proved also
for irreducible higher rank lattices, using the deep result of [LMR], on the
comparison between the word and Riemannian metrics on these groups.

      Fix now G = SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1). The computation of p(G), in Sec-
tion 4, is carried out in several stages, starting by analysis of the case where π
is irreducible, and reliance on the classification of those representations with
nontrivial cohomology, via Lie algebra cohomology. This proof does not shed
light on what seems to be a rather surprising coincidence: the equality in Theo-
rem 1.9. For the groups SO(n, 1) we do indicate a different approach, involving
more geometric arguments, proving the result without any classification, and
explaining better (though not completely) this phenomenon. At any rate, the
above classification yields information only on irreducible representations, and
for these, only on the Lp integrability of their K-finite matrix coefficients. To
implement this classification, we prove the following result, which seems of
independent interest:

     Theorem 1.11. Let K < G be a maximal compact subgroup, and π be any
unitary G-representation. If π is strongly Lp for some 2 ≤ p < ∞, then matrix
coefficients of all K-finite vectors are in Lp+ǫ (G) for all ǫ > 0 (and satisfy
an explicit decay estimate, depending on p and not on π). Furthermore, every
irreducible representation in the decomposition of π into irreducibles is strongly
Lp as well.

     See Theorem 2.1 below for the explicit bound on the K-finite matrix
coefficients, and for the complete result. Our proof makes essential use of
the whole continuous strip of complementary series representations, and tight
estimates of the corresponding spherical functions. See also Section 8.4 below
for further discussion and several natural questions in this direction which
remain unanswered.
     We shall see that Theorem 1.11 makes the abstract notion of strongly
Lp representations explicit and very amenable to work with. Still, one needs
further information to deal with the second ingredient of Definition 1.8. This
is provided by the following:

     Theorem 1.12. Let G be as above, and π be any unitary G-representation.
Let Λ < G be any noncompact subgroup. Then the natural restriction map
H 1 (G, π) → H 1 (Λ, π|Λ ) is injective.

     Theorems 1.9–1.12 will be repeatedly used throughout the proofs of the
aforementioned rigidity results. Our strategy, roughly, is to show how the
situation the group encounters, gives rise to a unitary representation with
nonvanishing cohomology (e.g., by use of Theorem 1.12). After analyzing the
decay of an appropriately chosen dense subspace of matrix coefficients (not
necessarily K-finite), we convert the information gained by Theorem 1.9 to
the required geometric conclusion.

          2. Unitary representations of SO(n, 1) and SU(n, 1)

     I. General preliminaries and notation. We begin by recalling some of the
structure and basic properties of the groups G = SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1), while
introducing some notation.
     Let F be the field R of real numbers, or the field C of complex numbers.
Fix some n ≥ 2 and let x1 x̄1 + · · · + xn x̄n − xn+1 x̄n+1 be a quadratic form
of signature (n, 1) over F , where x → x̄ is the identity in the case F = R,
and complex conjugation when F = C. The groups SO(n, 1) and SU(n, 1) are
defined as the subgroups of SLn+1 (F ) (F = R, C resp.) preserving this form.
For F = C this group is connected, but when F = R the connected component
has index 2, and for brevity we keep hereafter the notation SO(n, 1) for the
connected component.
     Fixing the first m − n variables yields a natural embedding of SO(n, 1)
(resp. SU(n, 1)) in SO(m, 1) (resp. SU(m, 1)), for m ≥ n. In addition, SO(n, 1)
embeds naturally in SU(n, 1). These groups are simple Lie groups of real rank
124                              YEHUDA SHALOM


one. We fix the embedding of
                                                          
                                         cosh t   sinh t
(1)                 A∼
                     = SO(1, 1) =                              = at
                                         sinh t   cosh t
in the lower right block, as a Cartan subgroup for all of them. In the case
F = R, K = SO(n) embedded naturally in the upper n × n submatrix is a
maximal compact subgroup. When F = C, K = S(U (n) × U (1)), where U (n)
and U (1) (= {λ ∈ C| |λ| = 1}) act only on the first n variables/last variable,
resp., is a maximal compact subgroup. Let M be the centralizer of A in K.
When F = R we have M = SO(n − 1) (in the upper left (n − 1) × (n − 1)
submatrix), and when F = C, M = S(U (n − 1) × λI2 ) where λI2 denotes the
scalar 2 × 2 matrices with |λ| = 1, embedded in the lower right 2 × 2 block of
U (n, 1). Denote by M̃ the normalizer of A in K. Then M ⊳ M̃ has index 2, and
a nontrivial element in the Weyl group W ∼ = M̃ /M may be represented by the
diagonal matrix w whose diagonal has −1 in the two entries n − 2, n − 1, and
1’s elsewhere. We have wat w−1 = a(−t) , and the action of W on A gives rise to
two (closures of) Weyl chambers, denoted A+ = {at |t ≥ 0}, A− = {at |t ≤ 0}
(see (1)). The polar (or Cartan) decomposition G = KA+ K holds, where for
every g ∈ G there is a unique element a ∈ A+ with g = k1 ak2 . We may thus
define the “Cartan projection” a : G → A+ , by the equality:

(2)            g = k1 a(g)k2 ,     ki ∈ K,    a(g) ∈ A+ ,        g ∈ G.

     Let a = Lie A, and let exp : a → A be the exponential map, with its
inverse log : A → a its inverse. Then dim a = 1, and corresponding to our
choice of positive Weyl chamber we fix a positive simple root β. All the positive
roots of a are either β or 2β. For SO(n, 1) the roots are all equal to β, which has
multiplicity n − 1. Notice that because we identify A as the Cartan subgroup
of all the SO(n, 1)’s, β, as functional on a, does not depend on n, and it is
the same unique positive simple root for all these groups. The same remark
applies to SU(n, 1). Here the root β has multiplicity 2n − 2, and 2β is also a
root, with multiplicity 1.
     Let ρ = ρ(G) denote half sum of the positive roots of G. We define δ(G)
as the (integral) value for which 2ρ = δ(G)β. That is,
                                                        
                                  n − 1 G = SO(n, 1)
(3)                     δ(G) =                             .
                                    2n    G = SU(n, 1)

     Since for SO(n, 1), 2β is not a root, the sum of all the root spaces cor-
responding to β is an abelian subalgebra, which corresponds to an abelian
subgroup N ∼ = Rn−1 . In the case of SU(n, 1), the appearance of a (one dimen-
sional) root space for 2β, makes N a two-step nilpotent group, the so-called
Heisenberg group, of dimension 2n − 1. The following Iwasawa decomposition
                    RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                          125

holds:

(4)                                   G = KAN.

     The Haar measure of G, denoted hereafter simply by dg, may be expressed
in both polar and in Iwasawa coordinates (2), (4). We shall need both of them
in the sequel, but recall now only that of the first one. If da, dk denote the
Haar measures of A, K respectively, then the Haar measure of G in terms of
the polar decomposition (2) is given by dg = J(a)dkdadk, where:
(5)
 J(a) = (eβ(loga) − e−β(log a) )n−1 ,                           G = SO(n, 1),
 J(a) = (e2β(loga) − e−2β(log a) )(eβ(loga) − e−β(log a) )2n−2 ,      G = SU(n, 1),
          δ(G)β(log a)
 J(a) ∼ e                ,                                   G = SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1).

      II. Strongly Lp representations: The complete formulation of Theorem
1.11. Before we state the main result of Section 2, Theorem 2.1 below, some
remarks on the notion of strongly Lp representation (defined at the beginning
of §1.III) are in order. The condition of Lp+ε integrability, rather than simply
Lp -integrability, may seem peculiar to the reader who comes across this notion
for the first time. In fact, in the literature it is the latter condition for strongly
Lp representations which is sometimes used. However, it is well-known (see also
Theorem 2.1 below), that matrix coefficients for “nice” vectors in irreducible
representations of simple Lie groups are, for some p < ∞, in Lp+ε for all ε > 0,
but not in Lp . Consequently, it will turn out to be convenient for us to use
this definition. The “nice” vectors alluded to, are those which are K-finite.
Recall that given a fixed maximal compact subgroup K in a semisimple Lie
group G, a vector v ∈ H is called K-finite if the dimension of Span{π(K)v},
denoted henceforth by dimK v, is finite. Often, the definition of strongly Lp
representations for simple Lie groups requires the subspace H0 to be that of
K-finite vectors (always dense by the Peter-Weyl theorem), and sometimes
this assumption is made implicitly. For our discussion, the distinction between
assuming Lp -integrability of matrix coefficients for the K-finite vectors, and
this condition for some dense subspace, is crucial. Our next theorem, the main
result of this section, shows in particular that for SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1), these two
notions indeed coincide. See Section 8.4 below for more on this issue.
     2.1 Theorem. Keep the above notation and let G be a simple Lie group
with finite center, locally isomorphic to either SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1) (n ≥ 2).
There exists a constant C = C(G), such that for every unitary G-representation
(π, H), and 2 ≤ p < ∞, the following conditions are equivalent:

 1. π is strongly Lp .
126                               YEHUDA SHALOM


 2. For every K-finite vectors u, v ∈ H, and every g ∈ G, one has:
(6) |hπ(g)u, vi|
                                  δ(G)
                                       β(log a(g))
         ≤ C(1 + β(log a(g)))e−     p                (dimK u)1/2 (dimK v)1/2 · kuk · kvk.
    (Recall that β is the simple positive root; a(g) and δ(G) are as in (2) and
    (3) of §2.I.)                                 R⊕
 3. For every direct integral decomposition π =      πx (with πx ’s not necessar-
    ily irreducible), the representation πx is strongly Lp for almost every x.
 4. If σ is any unitary representation weakly contained in π, then σ is strongly
    Lp as well.
      If, in addition, π is irreducible, then 1–4 are also equivalent to:
 5. There exists one nonzero diagonal matrix coefficient of π which is in
    Lp+ε (G) for all ε > 0.

     Much of the rest of Section 2 will be devoted to proving Theorem 2.1.
We remark here that a similar proof works for every rank one simple algebraic
group over a non-Archimedean local field, and in fact for “large” subgroups
of the automorphism group of a regular tree (e.g., unimodular noncompact
subgroups acting transitively on its boundary).

     III. Preliminaries toward the proof of Theorem 2.1. We begin with a dis-
cussion which essentially amounts to showing that (1) implies (2) in Theorem
2.1 for p = 2, a result which follows also from [CHH]. However, we present an
alternative, simple approach, and establish along the way other results which
will be needed in the sequel. The reader interested in a short path to the basics
of the pointwise decay estimates (which are fundamental in what follows), may
find our treatment helpful (although Theorem 2.2 seems new, and may be of
interest also to specialists).

     2.2 Theorem. Let G a unimodular, second countable, locally compact
group, and K < G a compact subgroup. Denote by λ = L2 (G) the regular
G-representation, and let (π, H) be some unitary G-representation satisfying
the following two properties:

 (i) There exists a nonzero vector v ∈ H such that hπ(g)v, vi ≥ 0 for all g ∈ G
     (we call such v a G-positive vector ).
(ii) π K , the subspace of K-invariant vectors, has dimension 1.

    Let vK ∈ H be the unique (up to scalar ) nonzero K-invariant unit vector
in H. Then for every K-invariant functions ϕ, ψ ∈ L2 (G) with kϕk = kψk = 1,
and for every g ∈ G:
(7)                        |hλ(g)ϕ, ψi| ≤ hπ(g)vK , vK i.
                  RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                     127

     Remark. If assumption (ii) is removed, we still have an inequality similar
to (7), except that on the right-hand side a supremum over the K-invariant
vectors has to be taken. If (ii) is replaced by the more flexible assumption,
dim π K < ∞, this supremum becomes again a maximum (this more general
version may be useful in various examples of totally disconnected groups).

     Proof. For a finite positive measure ν on G, and a unitary G-represen-
tation σ, denote
              R by σ(ν) the corresponding convolution operator, defined by
hσ(ν)u, vi = hσ(g)u, vi dν(g). Let m be the normalized Haar measure of
K. If v is a positive G-vector, then π(m)v is clearly nonzero, G-positive, and
K-invariant; hence by (ii) we deduce that vK is G-positive. Therefore the
right-hand side in (7) is nonnegative. By replacing the functions with their
absolute values, we may assume that ϕ and ψ are nonnegative, discarding the
absolute value on the left-hand side of (7). Suppose now that (7) fails for
some g0 ∈ G. Notice that by K-invariance, the set of g’s for which it fails
is nonempty, open, and bi-K-invariant. We may therefore find a probability
measure µ on G (continuous with respect to the Haar measure), which is bi-
K-invariant, and such that (7) fails in its support. This implies that kλ(µ)k ≥
hλ(µ)ϕ, ψi > hπ(µ)vK , vK i. We now observe that hπ(µ)vK , vK i = kπ(µ)k,
which together with the previous inequality yields kλ(µ)k > kπ(µ)k. To prove
this observation notice that by left K-invariance of µ, for every u the vector
π(µ)u is K-invariant; hence π(µ)u = t(u)vK , for some t(u) ∈ C. Since π(m)u
is K-invariant, we have π(m)u = s(u)vK where |s(u)| ≤ kuk. Using the right
K-invariance of µ we get for every unit vectors u, w ∈ H:

             |hπ(µ)u, wi| = |hπ(µ)π(m)u, wi| = |hπ(µ)s(u)vK , wi|
                         ≤ |hπ(µ)vK , wi| = |t(vK )hvK , wi|
                         ≤ |t(vK )hvK , vK i| = hπ(µ)vK , vK i.

Hence kπ(µ)k ≤ hπ(µ)vK , vK i ≤ kπ(µ)k, and equality must hold, as claimed.
Now, the inequality kλ(µ)k > kπ(µ)k we have established, contradicts the
following result, whose proof therefore completes the proof of Theorem 2.2.

     2.3 Lemma. Let λ = L2 (G) be the regular G-representation, and π be
a unitary G-representation with a positive G-vector. Then for every posi-
tive, continuous, compactly supported, probability measure µ on G, one has:
kπ(µ)k ≥ kλ(µ)k.

    Proof. We first reduce the lemma to the case where µ is symmetric. In-
deed, denoting µ̂(B) = µ(B −1 ), we see that the convolution ν = µ̂ ∗ µ is
symmetric, and for every unitary G-representation σ, one has:

               kσ(ν)k = kσ(µ̂)σ(µ)k = kσ(µ)∗ σ(µ)k = kσ(µ)k2 .
128                            YEHUDA SHALOM


Hence, taking σ = π, λ shows that proving the lemma for the symmetric
measure ν suffices. Now, denoting by µm the m-th convolution, we have
π(µm ) = π(µ)m . Taking a bounded neighborhood U of the identity such that
hπ(g)v, vi ≥ 1/2 for all g ∈ U , we get for the G-positive vector v:

      hπ(µ)2n v, vi1/2n = hπ(µ2n )v, vi1/2n
                                             1/2n
                                                               1/2n
                                                        1 2n
                            Z
                        =  hπ(g)v, vidµ2n (g)     ≥     µ (U )
                                                        2
                           G

(for the last inequality, the positivity of v was used). However, it is well-
known and easily verified that for every locally compact group G, a symmetric
continuous (compactly supported) probability measure µ, and a bounded open
set U ⊆ G, one has µ2n (U )1/2n → kλ(µ)k (for discrete groups this result
is due to Kesten [Ke] and similar arguments apply in general). It follows
                                    1
that kπ(µ)k ≥ lim infhπ(µ)2n v, vi 2n ≥ kλ(µ)k, which completes the proofs of
Lemma 2.3 and Theorem 2.2.

     Remark. Notice that Lemma 2.3 yields a lower bound in terms of the
regular representation on all the norms of convolution operators for represen-
tations with positive vectors. One family of such representations is that of
the form π = L2 (X, m), where (X, m) is a quasi-invariant σ-finite G-measure
space. Another is the family of representations of the form π = σ ⊗ σ̄, where σ
is any unitary G-representation and σ̄ is its contragredient dual (indeed, any
vector v ⊗ v̄ is then positive). Therefore, kπ ⊗ π̄(µ)k ≥ kλ(µ)k for any unitary
G-representation π, where λ and µ are as in Lemma 2.3. This generalizes a
result of Pisier [Pis], and when G is amenable, shows that π ⊗ π̄ always con-
tains weakly the trivial representation (which is the main result of [Bek1]).
After the completion of the paper, we learned from B. Bekka that this notion
of “positive vectors” had been studied by R. Godement [Go], who asked, in
modern terminology, whether any representation (of an amenable group) with
a positive vector, contains weakly the trivial representation. An affirmative
answer for some groups was obtained by Bekka in [Bek2]. Lemma 2.3 yields
the result for all (amenable) groups.
     As we observe below, (7) can be applied to get a sharp decay estimate on
K-finite matrix coefficients, once an appropriate representation π is present.
We will be interested, however, not only in decay estimates for the regular
representation, but in a more general class. Indeed, it is clear from the proof
of Theorem 2.2 that the same result holds if we replace λ by any unitary repre-
sentation σ which is weakly contained (see 2.4 below) in λ. To see that, observe
that for any such representation we have kσ(µ)k ≤ kλ(µ)k for every (not neces-
sarily positive) continuous measure µ. All that was proved in the second part
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       129

of the proof is the inequality kλ(µ)k ≤ kπ(µ)k, which then continues to hold if
λ is replaced by σ. As was shown by Eymard [Ey], the condition on norms of
convolution operators is in fact equivalent to the weak containment of σ in λ.
A more commonly known definition is the following:
    2.4 Definition. The G-representation σ is said to be weakly contained in λ,
denoted σ ≺ λ, if every n × n submatrix of σ can be approximated, uniformly
on compact subsets in G, by n × n submatrices of some multiple (perhaps
countable) direct sum of λ.
     See [CHH], [Sh3] and the references therein, for more on this notion.
We now wish to derive from (7) an estimate for the matrix coefficients of all
K-finite vectors, not only K-fixed ones. For later use, we give this argument
in a general framework (compare with [CHH] and [Ho, §7]).
     2.5 Proposition. Keep the notation of Theorem 2.2, but denote now by
λ the G-representation on L2 (M ), where M is some σ-finite, Borel measure
G-space, on which G acts measurably by measure-preserving transformations
(e.g., M = G). Suppose that the function F : G → R has the property that
every K-invariant unit vectors ϕ, ψ ∈ L2 (M ) satisfy for all g ∈ G the inequality
|hλ(g)ϕ, ψi| ≤ F (g). Let σ be a G-representation with σ ≺ λ, and let u, v be
some K-finite vectors in Hσ . Then for all g ∈ G:
(8)         |hσ(g)u, vi| ≤ F (g) · (dimK u)1/2 (dimK v)1/2 · kuk · kvk.

      Proof. We claim that it is enough to establish (8) when σ = λ. Indeed,
first notice that this implies (8) when σ = ∞ · λ. Next, fix K-finite vec-
tors u, v ∈ Hσ , and apply the fact that every n × n submatrix of σ can be
approximated uniformly on compact subsets by submatrices of ∞ · λ to the
submatrix associated with a finite set of vectors including basis elements for
both Span{Kv} and Span{Ku}. Restricting our attention to the K-action,
it follows by its compactness, that the K-representations on Span{Kv} and
Span{Ku} are (properly) contained in ∞ · λ (restricted to K), and that more-
over the “approximating” vectors in ∞ · λ can be chosen to span isomorphic
K-representations (this is a standard exercise related to the discreteness of the
so-called Fell topology, on unitary duals of compact groups). In particular,
the dimension of the K-spans are the same, and since we are assuming now
that the pointwise estimate (8) holds for the pointwise approximating matrix
coefficients, it must also be satisfied by hσ(g)u, vi.
      We are thus reduced to the case σ = λ. To establish (8) in that case,
we first fix a countable dense subgroup K0 < K (recall G is assumed second
countable). Given any K-finite vectors u, v ∈ L2 (M ), define the functions:
      ϕ(m) = sup{|u(km)| | k ∈ K0 },        ψ(m) = sup{|v(km)| | k ∈ K0 }.
130                                          YEHUDA SHALOM


      Observe that since K0 is countable, the functions ϕ and ψ are well-defined
as measurable functions, in the sense that they do not depend on the choice
of u and v in their class of almost everywhere equal functions. The values of
ϕ(m) or ψ(m) may be infinite, but we shall shortly see that ϕ and ψ are in
L2 (M ), and in particular this can happen only on a null set. Once the latter
L2 -estimate is established, we deduce from the fact that ϕ and ψ are K0 -
invariant, and the continuity of the K-action on L2 (M ) ([Zi1, Appendix B.3]),
that they are actually invariant under any k ∈ K (as measurable functions).
Thus, as ϕ and ψ are also positive, and their matrix coefficient dominates
(the absolute value of) that of u and v resp., in order to deduce (8) it only
remains now to show that their L2 -norms satisfy kϕk ≤ (dimK u)1/2 · kuk, and
kψk ≤ (dimK v)1/2 · kvk.
      Assume for simplicity kuk = 1 and set n = dimK u. Let u1 , . . . , un be an
orthonormal basis for Ku. Then, for every k ∈ K there exist unique complex
                                                       P
numbers θ1 (k), . . . , θn (k), such that u(km) =         θi (k)ui (m) for almost every
m ∈ M . In fact, by the countability of K0 , almost every m satisfies the latter
                                                                 |θi (k)|2 ≡ 1. Now, by
                                                              P
equality simultaneously for all k ∈ K0 . Obviously,
the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, almost every m ∈ M satisfies for all k ∈ K0 :
                 X n                    Xn             Xn                 Xn
    |u(km)|2 = |       θi (k)ui (m)|2 ≤    |θi (k)|2 ·     |ui (m)|2 =       |ui (m)|2 .
                    i=1                         i=1          i=1       i=1

              ϕ2 (m)                 (m)|2
                           P
Therefore              ≤       |ui   almost everywhere, and
              Z                    n
                                 Z X                     Xn Z
      kϕk =       ϕ2 (m)1/2    ≤(      |ui (m)|2 )1/2 = (     |ui (m)|2 )1/2 = n1/2
              M                      M i=1                    i=1 M

as required. A similar analysis applies to the function ψ.
     Theorem 2.2 and Proposition 2.5 yield together a pointwise estimate for
all K-finite vectors, in all the representations which are weakly contained in
the regular representation, in terms of a single matrix coefficient of a special
representation. In general, there may be several (even irreducible) representa-
tions satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 2.2. Notice that the best estimate
will be achieved if a representation π as in Theorem 2.2 exists, which is itself
weakly contained in the regular representation, for then the pointwise bound
that it puts is sharp, being attained by the very same distinguished matrix
coefficient. It is perhaps surprising that for any connected topological group
(with K a maximal compact subgroup), such a representation can indeed be
found (see the discussion after the following result). Although we shall not
need it in the sequel, for completeness let us observe its uniqueness.
    2.6 Proposition. Let G be a locally compact, second countable group,
and K a compact subgroup. Suppose that there exists a unitary G-representa-
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                        131

tion which satisfies assumptions (i) and (ii) of Theorem 2.2, and is also weakly
contained in the regular representation. Then there exists such an irreducible
representation, and it embeds in any other representation with these properties.
In particular, there is at most one irreducible representation satisfying all three
properties.

      Proof. Suppose that π satisfies all the properties, and that π1 is another
such representation. Let v, v1 be K-invariant unit vectors in the representation
space of π and π1 , respectively. Then by Theorem 2.2 and Proposition 2.5
we have hπ(g)v, vi ≤ hπ1 (g)v1 , v1 i for all g ∈ G, and similarly, the opposite
inequality holds. Thus, we have equality, which implies that the closures of
the G-span of v and v1 are isomorphic. Denoting the G-representation on these
isomorphic subrepresentations by σ, we see that σ satisfies all the properties,
and our argument shows that it embeds in any other representation sharing
them. We show σ is irreducible. Let Hσ be the representation space for σ,
and vσ be the unique (up to scalar) K-invariant vector. Suppose we have a
G-invariant decomposition Hσ = H1 + H2 , and write correspondingly vσ =
v1 + v2 . As Gvσ spans Hσ , if vi = 0 then Hi = 0 (i = 1, 2). However, both
v1 , v2 are K-invariant, hence multiples of vσ , and orthogonal to each other.
This is impossible unless one of them is zero.

     Notice that if G is totally disconnected, then a compact open subgroup
K < G always exists, and if P < G is any cocompact subgroup, then the
G-representation on L2 (G/P ) has a finite dimensional subspace of K-invariant
vectors. Thus, (the more general version of) Theorem 2.2 can be applied, and
if such amenable P exists, the additional condition in 2.6 is satisfied as well.
On the other extreme, this phenomenon occurs when G is connected, and a
representation L2 (G/P ) of the latter form, satisfying the three conditions in
2.6, always exists (when K is maximal compact). The general case here is
reduced by a standard argument to that of a semisimple group, and although
the latter may be dealt with generally, we shall discuss henceforth only the
simple Lie groups which are of interest to us.
     We retain the notations of subsection I. Let G = KAN be as in (4), and M
be the centralizer of A in K. Then P = M AN is an amenable subgroup, being
a compact extension of the solvable group AN . We have G = K ·P . The quasi-
regular G-representation on L2 (G/P ) obviously satisfies the two conditions of
Theorem 2.2 (as K is transitive on G/P ). It is also weakly contained in L2 (G),
since P is amenable; thus all three conditions in 2.6 hold. When we choose
a quasi-invariant measure on G/P which is invariant under K, the Harish-
Chandra Ξ-function is defined as the diagonal matrix coefficient corresponding
to the constant unit function. By 2.2 and 2.5, taking F (g) = Ξ(g) in (8) yields
a (tight) bound on matrix coefficients of all K-finite vectors in representations
132                               YEHUDA SHALOM


σ ≺ L2 (G). The first estimates of the Ξ-function are due to Harish-Chandra.
Here we shall use the following (sharp) estimate for the rank one Lie groups
(see [GV, 4.6.4]):
                                                     1
(9)               Ξ(g) ≤ C(1 + β(log a(g))) · e− 2 δ(G)β(log a(g)) .
     Preparing still for the proof of Theorem 2.1, we recall now some basic
properties of the class one (also called “spherical”) representations of G =
SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1).
     Recall that a class one (irreducible) G-representation, is one that contains
a nonzero vector invariant under K. Such vector is unique up to scalar. A
general method to construct such representations is as follows: Let aC be the
complexification of a = Lie A, and λ ∈ a∗C . Then man → eλ(log a) defines a
character on P = M AN , which is unitary if and only if λ ∈ ia∗ . Inducing (uni-
tarily) this P -representation to G, yields a representation πλ which is obviously
unitary if λ ∈ ia∗ . In that case πλ is called a principal series (spherical) repre-
sentation. Denote by vλ a K-invariant unit vector, with ϕλ (g) = hπλ (g)v, vi.
Since inducing any unitary representation from an amenable subgroup yields
a representation which is weakly contained in the regular representation, from
Theorem 2.2 and Proposition 2.5 it follows that |ϕλ (g)| ≤ Ξ(g). For λ = 0
we have, by definition, equality. There are more class one representations πλ ,
which are obtained by taking λ ∈ a∗ with 0 ≤ λ ≤ δ(G)β        2    = ρ. (Here one
has to change the inner product.) These are called the complementary series
(spherical) representations. For λ = ρ, πλ is the trivial representation. The
corresponding spherical functions ϕλ (g) satisfy the following estimate (see [GV,
5.1 (5.1.18)]), for some constant C depending only on G :
(10)               |ϕλ (g)| ≤ C(1 + β(log a(g)))e(λ−ρ) log a(g) .
     As the πλ ’s are irreducible, having one matrix coefficient in Lp (G) implies
the same for a dense subset (linear combinations of G-translations); hence from
(10) and (5) in Section 1 we get:
(∗)      For λ = |λ|β    (0 ≤ |λ| ≤ |ρ| = 12 δ(G)),      πλ is strongly Lp if
              p( 21 δ(G) − |λ|) ≥ δ(G),     i.e.,   p ≥ 2δ(G)/δ(G) − 2|λ|.
     Lower bounds on the spherical functions of complementary series repre-
sentations will be needed as well. It turns out that these spherical functions
are positive, and for some constant C ′ = C ′ (G) > 0 (see [GV, 4.7 (4.7.13)])
satisfy:
(11)                C ′ e(λ−ρ) log a(g) ≤ ϕλ (g)     ρ/2 ≤ λ ≤ ρ.
    By the reference cited above, (11) holds for every 0 ≤ λ, with C ′ depending
on λ (when λ = 0, C ′ = 1, see [GV, 4.5]). Actually (11) holds for all 0 ≤ λ ≤ ρ,
                     RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                               133

but we have not found an easy reference for that. For λ > 0, the ratio between
the two sides of (11) tends to a positive bounded limit when g → ∞, so (11)
reflects the true asymptotics of ϕλ . This fact will be of considerable importance
to us later (see (1) in step (ii) of Theorem 4.2 below, and the remark thereafter).
     The above principal and complementary series representations exhaust all
the class one irreducible representations of SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1). The existence
of the whole continuous strip of complementary series representations is special
to these two families of groups, and will be essential for the proof of Theorem
2.1, to which we can now turn.

     IV. Proof of Theorem 2.1.
     1 =⇒ 2. Consider first the case p = 2. By a general result in [CHH]
(which applies to any G, not necessarily a simple Lie group), it follows that π
is weakly contained in the regular representation. The bound (6) then follows
from Theorem 2.2, Proposition 2.5 (with M = G), and the bound (9) for the
Harish-Chandra Ξ-function (which is taken as F (g) in Proposition 2.5). The
constant C obtained here is the same as in (9). In general we will show that
                                           ′
this C can be multiplied by at most 1/C 2 , where C ′ is taken from (11).
     We may assume that 2 < p < ∞. Let q be the value for which 1q + p1 = 21 .
Let us assume first that p ≤ 4, which means q ≥ 4. Take λ for which the
spherical function ϕλ is in Lq+ε (G) for all ε > 0, but not in Lq (G). This,
in light of estimates (10), (11), singles out the λ satisfying q(ρ − λ) = 2ρ.
Moreover, πλ is strongly Lq (see (∗) above). As q ≥ 4, we have λ ≥ ρ/2.
Consider now the tensor product π ⊗ πλ . For every v1 , v2 in the assumed dense
subspace of π, and u1 , u2 in the dense subspace of vectors with Lq+ε matrix
coefficients in πλ , we have by the choice of q and the Hölder inequality:
h(π ⊗ πλ )(g)v1 ⊗ u1 , v2 ⊗ u2 i = hπ(g)v1 , v2 i · hπλ (g)u1 , u2 i ∈ L2+ε   for all ε > 0.
Since this holds also for sums of tensors vi ⊗ui , and these form a dense subspace
of the representation space for π ⊗ πλ , we deduce that π ⊗ πλ is strongly L2 .
The case p = 2 at the beginning of the proof, yields now the inequality (6)
(with p = 2) for all K-finite vectors in π ⊗ πλ .
     Let now u, w be any K-finite vectors for the representation π, and let vλ
be the unit K-invariant vector in πλ . Then u ⊗ vλ , w ⊗ vλ are K-finite vectors
for π ⊗ πλ , with dimK (u ⊗ vλ ) = dimK u and dimK (w ⊗ vλ ) = dimK w. By the
above discussion we get, assuming u and w are also normalized:
         |hπ(g)u, wi| · |hπλ (g)vλ , vλ i| = |h(π ⊗ πλ )(g)u ⊗ vλ , w ⊗ vλ i|
          ≤ C · (1 + β(log a(g)))e−ρ(log a(g)) · (dimK u)1/2 · (dimK w)1/2 .
     From this and (11), we now deduce:
                 C
  |hπ(g)u, wi| ≤ ′ (1 + β(log a(g)) · e−λ(log a(g)) · (dimK u)1/2 · (dimK w)1/2 .
                 C
134                             YEHUDA SHALOM


To see that this is indeed the required estimate, it only remains to verify that
δ(G)β    2ρ
  p (= p ) = λ. Since λ and ρ are (nonzero) multiples one of the other, the
      λ
ratio 2ρ makes sense, and we have to show that 1p = 2ρ λ
                                                         . As λ was chosen such
that 1q = ρ−λ                        1    λ                  1 1     λ   ρ−λ   1
           2ρ , the desired equality p = 2ρ is equivalent to p + q = 2ρ + 2ρ = 2 ,
which is exactly how q was chosen. This completes the case p ≤ 4.
     If p > 4 take again q with 1p + 1q = 12 . Now 2 < q < 4, so t = 2q > 4. Let
λ′ be such that the spherical function ϕλ′ is “exactly” in Lt+ε (G) (again, see
(∗) above). Then ρ/2 ≤ λ′ , and we may repeat the whole previous argument,
replacing πλ with πλ′ ⊗ πλ′ (which is strongly Lq by Hölder), and the vector vλ
by vλ′ ⊗ vλ′ . The argument proceeds similarly, with the one observation that
                                        ′
the constant may increase up to C/C 2 . This completes the proof of 1 =⇒ 2.

    2 =⇒ 4. An argument identical to that in the first part of the proof
of Proposition 2.5, shows that the K-finite matrix coefficients of σ satisfy the
same estimate (6). By (5) it is easy to see that they are in Lp+ε for all ε > 0.
                        R
    4 =⇒ 3. If π = πx then, as is well-known, for almost every x the
representation πx is weakly contained in π; so this implication is obvious.

     3 =⇒ 1. Taking a trivial decomposition π = π, we see that this claim is
again obvious.
     Finally, if some nonzero v ∈ H satisfies hπ(g)v, vi ∈ Lp+ε (G), then by
invariance of Haar measure it is easy to see that the matrix coefficients of any
two vectors in the (algebraic) span of π(G)v have this property, a subspace
which is dense by irreducibility. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1.

     V. Unitary representations and discrete subgroups of SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1).
The notion of critical exponent (see Definition 1.0 above) plays a central role
in our discussion. This and other related notions such as the limit set and its
Hausdorff dimension are covered, e.g., in [Ni]. Useful information concerning
the relation to spectral analysis appears in [Cor], and some extensions to gen-
eral CAT(-1) spaces can be found in [BM] (and the references therein). For
the benefit of the reader, we collect here some basic properties of the critical
exponent, which are used in the sequel.

     2.7 Lemma. Fix n ≥ 2. Retain the notation in Definition 1.0 and the
discussion preceding it.

(1) If Γ is a lattice in G = SO(n, 1) then δ(Γ) = n − 1. If it is a lattice in
    G = SU(n, 1) then δ(Γ) = 2n.
(2) If Λ < G then δ(Λ) ≤ δ(G). If equality holds and Λ is geometrically finite,
    then Λ is a lattice.
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       135

(3) If G is as in (1) and Λ < G is a discrete nonamenable subgroup, then
    for every ǫ > 0 there is a free subgroup (say, on two generators) Γ < Λ,
    satisfying δ(Γ) < ǫ.

     Proof. We remark first on the initial statement of (2). In [BM, §1] the no-
tion of critical exponent is extended naturally to any (not necessarily discrete)
closed subgroup of the isometry group of a locally compact CAT(-1) space.
The discussion there, Lemma 2.8 below, and the expression (5) for the Haar
measure, show that our formal notation for δ(G) in (3) above, indeed agrees
with the general geometric definition of the critical exponent. In particular,
the first claim of (2) follows from [BM, Lemma 1.5]. Next, for a geometri-
cally finite subgroup Λ < G, the bottom of the Laplacian spectrum on the
locally symmetric space Λ\G/K is achieved in the discrete L2 -spectrum (see
[Su2, 2.21], [Cor, §4]), and by its relation with the critical exponent (see the
proof of Theorem 2.10 below), we have that δ(Λ) = δ(G) if and only if 0 is an
(L2 -)eigenvalue of the Laplacian, which happens if and only if Λ is a lattice.
This accounts for (1) and the other direction in (2). For part (3) we pick,
using the nonamenability of Λ, two hyperbolic elements of it, say a, b, whose
attracting and repelling points on the boundary G/P are all different (their
existence follows easily from the nonamenability of Λ). As is well-known (by
Tits’ “ping-pong argument”), for n large enough an and bn generate a free
group. Using the fact that the metric contraction of an and bn on “most” of
the boundary grows linearly with n, an elementary argument shows that the
Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of the group generated by an and bn is
dominated by some constant multiple of n−1 . Since that dimension always
bounds the critical exponent from above (cf. [BJ]), the result follows.

    2.8 Lemma. Let a : G → A+ be as defined in (2), and let β be the positive
simple root as before. Then for every g ∈ G,

(12)                         d(go, o) = β(log a(g)).



     Proof. The equality (12) is well-known and easy to verify. Briefly, notice
that both sides of (12) are bi-K-invariant functions on G, and thus depend for
their value on A+ . On A+ both sides are additive characters, so that there
is only an issue of normalization. This may be checked by one example, say,
in the two dimensional real hyperbolic space. Another way the reader may be
convinced, is to recall that the inverse of the exponential of the two expressions
in (12) is in Lp (G) for the same (open) set of p’s, the infimum of which is δ(G)
(see (3), (5)).

     The following consequence illustrates in a simple but useful way, the con-
nection between critical exponents and the notion of strongly Lp representa-
tions.
    2.9 Corollary. Let Γ < G = SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1) be any discrete sub-
group, 2 ≤ p < ∞, and π be a unitary G-representation which is strongly Lp .
                        δ(Γ)
                               p
Then π|Γ is strongly L δ(G) .
     Proof. By 2 of Theorem 2.1, the K-finite matrix coefficients of π satisfy
the exponential decay estimate (6); thus by (12) each one is dominated by
(a constant multiple of):
                           δ(G)                          δ(G)
                     e(−     p
                                +ε)β(log a(g))
                                                 = e(−     p
                                                              +ε)d(go,o)
                                                                           .
By Definition 1.0, the function on the right-hand side, when restricted to Γ,
                             δ(Γ)
lies in Lq (Γ) for every q > δ(G) p, once ε > 0 is chosen sufficiently small.
     Another relation between critical exponents and strongly Lp representa-
tions is obtained by:
     2.10 Theorem. Let Γ < G be any discrete torsion-free subgroup. Then
the regular G-representation on L2 (G/Γ) is strongly Lp for
                        p = max{2, δ(G)/δ(G) − δ(Γ)}.
If p > 2 this estimate is sharp: L2 (G/Γ) is not strongly Lq for q < p.
     Proof. Let us first consider the class one spectrum of π = L2 (G/Γ), par-
ticularly, the complementary series representations πλ , 0 ≤ λ ≤ ρ, whichR are in
the support of the spectral measure µ of the decomposition π = πx dµ(x)
into irreducibles. Harish-Chandra has shown that the class one represen-
tations πx which occur in the decomposition, correspond (through the ac-
tion of the Casimir operator) to the L2 -spectrum of the Laplacian ∆ act-
ing on the locally symmetric space K\G/Γ. More precisely, denoting by πλ
(0 ≤ λ ≤ |ρ| = δ(G)/2) the representation πλβ , then this representation lies in
the support of µ, if and only if |ρ|2 − λ2 (= δ(G)2 /4 − λ2 ) lies in the spectrum
of ∆ (see e.g. [Cor, §4] and the references therein, for this and other related
results which are indicated without proof). On the other hand, the bottom
of the spectrum of ∆ may be precisely computed in terms of the critical ex-
ponent δ(Γ): it is equal to δ(Γ)(δ(G) − δ(Γ)) if δ(Γ) > δ(G)                δ(G) 2
                                                             2 , and to ( 2 ) if
δ(Γ) ≤ δ(G)
          2 (see also [Su2, 2.17]). In the second case we get that only principal
series spherical representations can appear in L2 (G/Γ), whereas in the first,
complementary series representations do appear, but only for
      r                                  r
         δ(G)2                                      δ(G) 2                 δ(G)

            4                                         2                      2

Therefore, all the K-invariant unit vectors vλ in these πλ ’s satisfy by (10) the
estimate:
(13)      |hπλ (g)vλ , vλ i| ≤ C · (1 + β(log a(g)) · e(δ(Γ)−δ(G))β log(a(g)) .
(Recall that 2ρ = δ(G)β.) If δ(Γ) ≤ δ(G)/2, by (9) we replace in (13) δ(Γ) by
δ(G)/2.
      Next,                                          2
         R let v be any K-invariant unit Rvector in L (G/Γ). Then by decompos-
ing π = πx dµ(x) we deduce that v = vx dµ(x), where each vx is (a multiple
of) an appropriate vλ , and thus the associated matrix coefficient satisfies the
decay estimate (13). A simple direct integral computation then shows that (13)
must hold also for v. We have thus established a uniform decay estimate for
all K-invariant vectors in L2 (G/Γ), and we may apply Proposition 2.5 (with
M = G/Γ) to get a corresponding estimate for all K-finite vectors. Finally,
by (5) we see that the right-hand side of (13) is in Lp (G) for every p such that
                                                                       δ(G)
p(δ(G) − δ(Γ)) > δ(G); that is, L2 (G/Γ) is strongly Lp for p = δ(G)−δ(Γ)    . In
case δ(Γ) ≤ δ(G)/2, it follows that this representation is strongly L .2

      The last claim of Theorem 2.10 follows from the fact that the above value
of the bottom of the Laplacian spectrum is sharp, estimate (11) for the spher-
ical functions, and 3 in Theorem 2.1.

               3. Cohomology of unitary representations
     I. Notation and some basic properties. Let G be a locally compact group
and (π, H) a (continuous) unitary G-representation. Denote by Z 1 (G, π) the
vector space of continuous G-cocycles with values in π, namely, the continuous
functions b : G → H satisfying:
(1)               b(gh) = b(g) + π(g)b(h)           for all g, h ∈ G.
The subspace of co-boundaries: b(g) = π(g)v − v for some v ∈ H, is denoted
by B 1 (G, π).
    3.1 Definition. The first cohomology group of G with values in π is the
quotient space: H 1 (G, π) = Z 1 (G, π)/B 1 (G, π).

     Given a cocycle b ∈ Z 1 (G, π), one can deform the linear action π to an
affine isometric action of G on H. More precisely, define an action ρ of G on
H by:
(2)                            ρ(g)v = π(g)v + b(g).
     Conversely, any affine isometric G-action on a Hilbert space H is easily
seen to be obtained by a cocycle on the linear part of the action (see e.g.
[HV, pp. 45–46] for this and other facts indicated below without proof). The
following simple and basic fact will be useful:
138                              YEHUDA SHALOM


     3.2 Lemma. Let π, b and ρ be as above. Then b ∈ B 1 (G, π) if an only if
the associated G-action ρ has a fixed point.

      We shall also need the following well-known fact (see [HV, §4.3]):

     3.3 Lemma. For any isometric group action on a Hilbert space, the fol-
lowing are equivalent:

 (i) The action has a fixed point.
(ii) Every orbit of the action is (norm) bounded.
(iii) There exists one (norm) bounded orbit.

      II. Restriction of cohomology: Proof of Theorem 1.12. We now come to
the first main result of this section. In [Sh4] it is proved in a more general
framework for any isometric action of a simple algebraic group over a local
field, on a CAT(0) space. As it will be essential to us on many occasions in
the sequel (see [Sh4] for other applications), we include a short proof here for
the more restricted result, sufficient for our purposes.

     3.4 Theorem. Let G be a simple Lie group with finite center, locally iso-
morphic to either SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1) (n ≥ 2). Suppose that G acts continu-
ously by isometries on a Hilbert space H, without fixed points. Then the action
is proper, namely, for every v ∈ H and a sequence gi → ∞, one has kgi vk → ∞.
In particular, in light of 3.2, for any noncompact subgroup Λ < G and any uni-
tary G-representation π, the natural restriction map H 1 (G, π) → H 1 (Λ, π|Λ )
is injective.

     Proof. Let us first prove the result in the case G = SL2 (R). We assume
that the action is not proper and show that it admits a global fixed point.
Suppose then that for some v ∈ H, gi → ∞, and M < ∞, one has kgi vk < M ,
or actually, what is more convenient for us, kgi v − vk < M . Consider the polar
decomposition: SL2 (R) = KA+ K, where K = SO(2) and A+ = diag(a, a−1 ) =
{(a)} with a ≥ 1. Decomposing gi = ki (ai )ki′ , a standard argument using the
compactness of K shows that we may assume without loss of generality that
gi = (ai ) ∈ A+ , with ai → ∞. Let N denote the upper triangular unipotent
subgroup, and fix some n ∈ N . Then (ai )−1 n(ai ) → e; hence for all i large
enough we have k(ai )−1 n(ai )v − vk < 1, and
           kn(ai )v − vk ≤ kn(ai )v − (ai )vk + k(ai )v − vk
                         = k(ai )−1 n(ai )v − vk + k(ai )v − vk < 1 + M.

     Next, write kn(ai )v − vk = k(ai )v − n−1 vk and repeat the same argument,
to get kv − n−1 vk = knv − vk < 2M + 1. It follows that the action of N on H
has a bounded orbit and hence, by Lemma 3.3, admits a fixed point w.
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                          139

     The last part of the proof (still, for SL2 (R)), is reminiscent of the so called
“Mautner phenomenon”: one shows that any N -fixed point in H must be fixed
by G. Indeed, let w be as above and consider the function ϕ(g) = kgw − wk.
Then ϕ is continuous, invariant under N , satisfies ϕ(g) = ϕ(g−1 ) for all g ∈ G,
and has the property that ϕ(g) = 0 if and only if gw = w. The argument in
[Lub1, Lemma 3.1.13] shows that every such function must be identically zero
on G; that is, w is indeed fixed by G.
     Let us return to the general case. Let G be (locally isomorphic to) SO(n, 1)
or SU(n, 1), and let H < G be a copy of (a finite cover of) SO(2, 1) ∼   = PSL2 (R).
The above proof for SL2 (R) works for any finite cover of it, hence holds also
for H. Recall that H and G share a mutual Cartan subgroup A. Thus, if for
some sequence gi → ∞, and v ∈ H, we have kgi v − vk < M , by writing a
polar decomposition gi = ki ai ki′ , we deduce that kai v − vk is bounded, and the
H-action on H is not proper. By the first part of the proof, H fixes a point in
H. In particular, every orbit of H is bounded (see Lemma 3.3). Let K be a
maximal compact subgroup of G, such that the polar decomposition G = KAK
holds, and let w ∈ H be a point fixed by K. Then, since kaw − wk < M for
some M < ∞ and every a ∈ A, we have kk1 ak2 w − wk = kaw − wk < M , so
that kgw − wk < M for all g ∈ G. By Lemma 3.3 we conclude that G admits
a fixed point in H.
      III. The induction operation on the first cohomology. An important no-
tion in representation theory is that of induction. We shall now discuss this
operation in relation to the first cohomology, and our main concern will be the
more subtle issue of nonuniform lattices.
      To begin however, let G be any locally compact group equipped with
Haar measure µ, and let Γ < G be a discrete subgroup. Given a unitary
Γ-representation (π, H), recall that the (unitarily) induced G-representation
IndGΓ π is defined as follows: The representation space for π is the space of
measurable functions f : G → H satisfying the two properties:
                                                           Z
                 −1
   f (gγ) = π(γ) f (g) for all γ ∈ Γ and a.e. g ∈ G,          kf (g)k2 < ∞.
                                                               G/Γ

The group G operates from the left: gf (x) =      f (g−1 x).
                                                         An equivalent way to
define this construction is as follows: Let X be a fundamental domain for G/Γ,
i.e. G = XΓ. Then we identify X with G/Γ and let α: G × X → Γ denote the
associated cocycle:
(3)                   α(g, x) = γ if and only if gxγ ∈ X.
Then the induced representation IndG   Γ π may be identified with the space
L2 (X, H), where the G-action is given by:
(4)                      gf (x) = π ◦ α(g−1 , x)f (g−1 · x).
140                              YEHUDA SHALOM


We have put the dot notation in g−1 · x to emphasize that this multiplication
is the G-action on X ∼ = G/Γ, but we suppress this notation henceforth.
     Next, we examine the induction operation on the first cohomology. Let
b ∈ Z 1 (Γ, π) and consider, for every g ∈ G, the function b̃: G → IndG
                                                                      Γ π defined
by:
(5)                          b̃(g)(x) = b ◦ α(g−1 , x).
Since b̃ is measurable on G, it is in fact continuous (this will also become
evident in the geometric interpretation we presently give). It is easy to verify
that (5) satisfies the formal cocycle identity (1), and we shall return to it
shortly; however, one first has to check the integrability condition:
                    Z
(6)                    kb̃(g)(x)k2 dµ(x) < ∞ for all g ∈ G.
                    X
If we assume that Γ is co-compact, then for a choice of bounded X, (6) is
obvious. Indeed, the cocycle α, hence also b̃(g), is bounded (as α(g, x) takes
only finitely many values for every g ∈ G). Condition (6) for nonuniform
lattices will occupy our attention shortly.
     Using the connection between cocycles and isometric actions (2), we may
present the situation in a more geometric framework. Starting with an affine
isometric action ρ of Γ on a Hilbert space H, whose linear part is π, consider
the induced isometric G-action on L2 (X, H), given by:
(7)                      gf (x) = ρ ◦ α(g−1 , x)f (g−1 x).
As in (4), it is easily verified that this is indeed a G-action, and recalling that
ρ(γ)v = π(γ)v + b(γ), we see that:
                 gf (x) = π ◦ α(g−1 , x)f (g−1 x) + b ◦ α(g−1 , x).
Thus (5) indeed describes a cocycle b̃ for the induced representation IndG
                                                                         Γ π.
The integrability condition (6) is equivalent to the condition:
                    Z
(8)                   kρ ◦ α(g−1 , x)f (g−1 x)k2 dµ(x) < ∞.
                     X
Notice that (8) does not depend
                             R on f , as once it holds for some function
f1 ∈ L2 (X, H); the fact that kgf − gf1 k2 dµ(x) = kf − f1 k2 dµ(x) < ∞
                                                  R
                                X                            X
shows that it holds for every other f ∈ L2 (X, H). We may thus choose any
test function f , and a natural one would be the constant function f ≡ o (which
immediately reduces (8) to (6)). An equivalent, but more convenient way for
us to present condition (6) (or (8)) is thus:
                  Z
(9)                 kρ ◦ α(g−1 , x)ok2 dµ(x) < ∞ for all g ∈ G.
                X
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                         141

     Suppose that Γ is finitely generated, and let S < Γ be a finite gen-
erating set. Let ℓ = ℓS be the corresponding word length on Γ. Denote
M = max{kρ(γ)ok | γ ∈ S}. Then successive iterations of the triangular in-
equality easily show that for any γ ∈ Γ one has kρ(γ)ok ≤ M · ℓ(γ). It follows
that in order to verify condition (9), it is enough to verify:
                    Z
(10)                   ℓ(α(g, x))2 dµ(x) < ∞ for all g ∈ G,
                    X

a condition which depends now only on Γ and G, and not on the representa-
tion π.

     3.5. Before discussing (10) for nonuniform lattices, let us assume for the
moment that for some Γ < G it holds. We shall prove that this implies The-
orem 1.10, by showing that the map b → b̃ induces an isomorphism between
the first cohomology groups. That (5) induces a (linear) map on the first co-
homology groups H 1 (Γ, π), H 1 (G, IndG  Γ π), namely, that it maps a coboundary
to a coboundary, is trivial. We observe first that this map is injective. Indeed,
by Lemma 3.2 the injectivity is equivalent to the following: If there exists an
α-invariant L2 -function for the G-isometric action, i.e., f ∈ L2 (X, H) with
ρ ◦ α(g−1 , x)f (g−1 x) = f (x) for all g ∈ G and almost every x ∈ X, then there
is a Γ-fixed point for its original action on H. This, however, is exactly what
is shown in [Zi1, 4.2.19] (even though in a somewhat different context).
     The issue of surjectivity of the map is less transparent, and here it is conve-
nient to use the fact that G is a Lie group. Since the argument is standard, and
we prove the surjectivity only for completeness (we will not be needing it in the
sequel), we shall be brief. Given a unitary G-representation, (π, H), we denote
by H∞ the space of smooth (C ∞ ) vectors, a space which is invariant under the
action of G, its Lie algebra g, and the universal enveloping algebra U (g). Also,
H∞ is a continuous G-module with its C ∞ topology, which is equivalent to the
topology defined by the semi-norms v → ||Xv||, X ∈ U (g). It was shown by
Pichaud (see [Pi, §4.1-4.2] for further related information, or [BW, p.287] for
cohomology in all degrees) that the natural map H 1 (G, H∞ ) → H 1 (G, H) is
an isomorphism. Hence, starting with any cocycle b ∈ Z 1 (G, IndG    Γ π), in order
to show that it lies in the image of the map in question, we may assume that
it takes values in (IndG     ∞
                         Γ π) . Assume for the moment that we show that any
element in the latter space is a smooth function on the manifold G/Γ with
values in H. Then the map γ → b(γ)(ē) makes sense, and it is easy to check
that it defines a cocycle b̄ : Γ → H such that (˜b̄) = b. Finally, to show that
a smooth vector is indeed a smooth function, it is enough to see that it is a
weakly smooth function on G/Γ, which can be shown to follow from Sobolev’s
Lemma (cf. [Yo, p.174]).

     IV. Induction of cohomology for nonuniform lattices: Proof of Theorem
1.10. The rest of Section 3 is devoted to proving the following result for
G = SO(n, 1).

    3.6 Theorem. If n ≥ 4 and Γ < G = SO(n, 1) is any nonuniform lattice,
then condition (10) is satisfied for an (appropriately chosen) fundamental do-
main X. Consequently, by 3.5 above, for every unitary Γ-representation π, the
map b → b̃ (given by (5)) defines an isomorphism H 1 (Γ, π) ∼= H 1 (G, IndG
                                                                          Γ π).

      In the appendix, the following is proved:

    3.7 Theorem. Theorem 3.6 holds if SO(n, 1) is replaced by any other
rank one simple Lie group.

      Of course, since the groups Sp(n, 1) and F4(−20) have property (T), we will
not be interested in them here. Although basically, the same approach used to
prove Theorem 3.6 applies to the other cases, the details become more involved,
and require somewhat more sophisticated tools. As the proof of Theorem 3.7 is
quite technical, we postpone it to the appendix, and concentrate here only on
Theorem 3.6. The relative simplification in the proof of the latter comes from
the fact that only for the real hyperbolic spaces one knows a “good” global
description of the Riemannian metric, while in the other cases a more local
analysis is required.
      We first make some general preliminary reductions, which will serve us in
the proofs of both theorems. Replacing Γ by a finite index subgroup, we may
assume that Γ is torsion free. Let K < G be a maximal compact subgroup
and choose a fundamental domain Y for the Γ (right) action on G, which is
K-invariant. Then for every k ∈ K, one has α(gk, y) = α(g, ky), and since
y → ky is measure preserving, we deduce that the integral expression in (10)
is invariant under the map g → gk. Furthermore, if k ∈ K, g ∈ G, γ ∈ Γ and
y ∈ Y satisfy gyγ ∈ Y , then also kgyγ ∈ Y , so that α(kg, y) = α(g, y). It
follows that (10) is also invariant under left K-multiplication. Hence by polar
decomposition, it is enough to establish (10) when g = at ∈ A (see (1) in §2.I).
      Let M be the centralizer of A in K. Since A commutes with M , its
(left) action on G/Γ induces an action on M \G/Γ. Recall that the fundamen-
tal domain Y is K-invariant, and in particular M -invariant. For all y ∈ Y ,
m ∈ M, at ∈ A, γ ∈ Γ we have at myγ = mat yγ, so that α(at , my) = α(at , y).
Thus, as far as the A-action is concerned, we may safely replace G through-
out the following by M \G and denote, still by Y , a fundamental domain for
the (right) Γ-action on the latter. Recall now that M \G may be identified
with the unit tangent bundle of the symmetric space K\G. With this iden-
tification, the left A-action on M \G is no more than the geodesic flow on
T 1 (K\G). Denoting by p: M \G → K\G the natural projection, and by d
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                         143

the usual G-invariant Riemannian metric on K\G, we thus have (with an ap-
propriate normalization): d(p(at y), p(y)) = t. The map p is Γ-equivariant;
hence F = p(Y ) is a fundamental domain for the right Γ-action on K\G,
and for γ ∈ Γ, we have at yγ ∈ Y if and only if p(at y)γ ∈ F . Now, no-
tice that the set of g ∈ G, for which condition (10) is satisfied, is closed
under multiplication (indeed, with notation as in the beginning of §3.III, write
kghf k ≤ kghf − gf k + kgf k = khf − f k + kgf k ≤ kf k + khf k + kgf k). Thus,
we may consider only at for −1 ≤ t ≤ 1, and together with the foregoing
discussion, we are now reduced to establishing the following result:
     3.8 Theorem. With the notation above, for every x ∈ K\G let w(x) de-
note the word length of the element γ ∈ Γ (with respect to some fixed generating
set of Γ), for which xγ ∈ F . The function w takes only finitely many values
on any compact subset C (since C meets only finitely many Γ-translates of F ),
and let f (p) = sup{w(x) | d(x, p) ≤ 1}. Then f |F ∈ L2 (F ) with respect to the
Riemannian volume on F ⊂ K\G.
     As mentioned, we discuss here only G = SO(n, 1), and in the appendix
also G = SU(n, 1), Sp(n, 1). First, we need to recall some fundamental results
of Garland-Raghunathan [GR] concerning the structure of some fundamental
domains for nonuniform lattices in rank one Lie groups.
     Let Γ be such a lattice. Then a fundamental domain for the Γ-action
on K\G can always be chosen to consist of finitely many cusps. Since their
number is finite, it is enough to show the L2 -integrability of f on each one,
so we confine our discussion hereafter to studying the behavior of f on one
such cusp Ω. The direction of the cusp Ω is determined by one geodesic ray,
which without loss of generality may assumed to be given by oA+ = o(at ),
where o = ē ∈ K\G, and at is as in (1) of Section 2. The cusp group, namely,
the group which fixes this geodesic ray, is the group P = M AN (see 2.I). The
group N ∩ Γ is cocompact in N .
     Let us specialize our discussion henceforth to G = SO(n, 1). Then we
have N ∼ = Rn−1 , so N ∩ Γ ∼= Zn−1 . Choosing a bounded fundamental domain
   ∼
T (= [0, 1)n−1 ) for N ∩ Γ in N , we have Ω = o · (at )t≥0 T (see [GR, Th. 0.6]).
We shall now need to recall the more concrete (and well-known) description
of the real hyperbolic space Hn ∼ = K\G. Recall that in the upper half space
model, H is represented by n coordinates (x1 , · · · , xn−1 , et ), with xi , t ∈ R,
          n

and the hyperbolic length element is given by:
                              dx21 + · · · + dx2n−1 + e2t dt2
(11)                   ds2 =                                  .
                                             e2t
These coordinates are induced by the Iwasawa decomposition, G = KN A,
where N = Rn−1 = {x1 , · · · , xn+1 , 1) and
                 A∼= R∗ = (0, 0, · · · , e−t ) (o = (0, ...0, 1)).
144                                    YEHUDA SHALOM


The G-Haar measure in the Iwasawa coordinates is given by (see [GV, 2.4.2]):
dg = e2ρ(log a) dkdnda, where dk is the K-Haar measure, dn = dx1 · · · dxn−1
is the Rn−1 -Haar measure, and da is the Haar measure of A, which, when
written additively through the exponent change of variable, is just the Lebesgue
measure dt. Since ρ(log a) = (n − 1)t, we have for the volume element on K\G:
                                      dx1 · · · dxn−1 dt
(12)                               dv =                  .
                                             e(n−1)t
    For a point y = (x1 , · · · , xn−1 , et ) ∈ Hn call t = h(y) the height of y.
    Let us now return to the proof of Theorem 3.8, concentrating on the cusp
Ω above. It is easy to see that if p ∈ Ω has height large enough, then for any
point x with d(p, x) ≤ 1 the element γ ∈ Γ such that xγ ∈ F actually satisfies
xγ ∈ Ω, and belongs to N . Since we may assume that the generating set S ⊂ Γ
contains the standard generators for the lattice Γ ∩ N ∼     = Zn−1 , (11) shows that
a bound on the difference between the first n − 1 coordinates of p and x yields
a bound on l(γ). This and (11) imply that f (p) (defined in 3.8) is dominated
by some constant multiple of the square root of the denominator of (11) at p,
namely, by Ceh(p) . Therefore, using (12) we get:
       Z                   Z                         Z∞                          Z∞
            2                      2h(p)                  2t −(n−1)t
           f (p)dv ≤ C             e       dv ≤ C̃        e e          dt = C̃        e(3−n)t dt.
       Ω                 T ×A+ o                     0                           0

    For n ≥ 4, the last integral converges. This completes the proof of Theo-
rem 3.6.

                         4. The invariants p(G) and p(Γ)

     I. p(G): Proof of Theorem 1.9 for simple Lie groups. Although our inter-
est in the present paper lies in the first cohomology, one may consider higher
cohomology groups, which are of interest in their own right, and have some
applications in the spirit of those presented here (these will be discussed else-
where.) We refer the reader to [Gu] for the general definition of the cohomology
groups H n (G, V ), for any locally compact group G, and a G-module V . One
can thus extend Definition 1.8 of the introduction as follows:
       4.1 Definition. Let G be a locally compact group and n ≥ 1. Define
       pn (G) = inf{1 ≤ p ≤ ∞| there exists a unitary G-representation π
                   which is strongly Lp , and satisfies H n (G, π) 6= 0}.

     As in Definition 1.8, if there is no π with H n (G, π) 6= 0, set pn (G) = ∞.
For consistency with Definition 1.8, we set p(G) = p1 (G). The main result of
this subsection, and one which is fundamental in the sequel, is the following:
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                         145

     4.2 Theorem. Suppose that G is a connected simple Lie group with finite
center, locally isomorphic to SO(n, 1) with n ≥ 3, or to SU(n, 1) with n ≥ 2.
Then p(G) = δ(G) (see (3) in §2.I for the numerical values).

     The proof of Theorem 4.2 is based on the classification of relative Lie al-
gebra cohomology of (g, K)-modules, and its scheme may be used to compute
(or at least estimate) pn (G) for any simple Lie group G and n ≥ 1. Follow-
ing the proof of the theorem we shall remark on the general case, and some
fundamental differences which arise when n > 1. We shall also indicate a
simpler, but more restricted, approach, suitable for the first cohomology and
the groups SO(n, 1) only, avoiding completely the use of (g, K)-modules and a
classification.

    Proof of Theorem 4.2. We assume that G is not locally isomorphic to
                         SL2 (R)(∼
                                 = SO(2, 1) ∼
                                            = SU(1, 1)),
a group which is discussed in Theorem 4.3 below. The proof is carried out in
several stages.

     (i) Classifying the irreducible representations π with nontrivial cohomol-
ogy. The first step is the correspondence between continuous and relative Lie
algebra cohomology for the associated (g, K) module of K-finite vectors (car-
ried out through the smooth cohomology); see [BW] or [Gu]. Once transferred
to this framework, one uses the classification of (irreducible) (g, K)-modules
with nontrivial cohomology. It turns out that SO(n, 1), n ≥ 3, has exactly
one irreducible representation with nontrivial first cohomology, and SU(n, 1)
has two such representations (conjugated under an outer automorphism of the
group). This result is due to Delorme (see [De] and the references therein),
and Hotta-Wallach [HW], but explicit constructions of the representations were
known previously, at the Hilbert space level (see [GGV]). The classification in
terms of Langlands parameters is, as we shall see, adequate for our purposes;
see [BW, Ch.VI §4] for a complete discussion of SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1) (or p.386
therein for a quick survey).

     (ii) Lp -integrability of K-finite matrix coefficients for the representations
in (i). Once the Langlands parameters of an irreducible representation of a
simple Lie group are known, one can compute the exponential decay along
the Cartan subgroup A, of the K-finite matrix coefficients. Since we need to
identify precisely the minimal p for which these matrix coefficients are in Lp+ǫ ,
and not just a bound, more should be said.
     If G is locally isomorphic to SL2 (C) then (i) yields exactly one represen-
tation (see below), which turns out to be tempered; its K-finite vectors have
matrix coefficients in L2+ǫ (G) for all ǫ > 0, but since it is not from the discrete
146                               YEHUDA SHALOM


series (which does not exist for SL2 (C)), no matrix coefficient can be square
integrable ([HT, Ch. V, 1.2.4]), so that p = 2 is indeed minimal. For the other
groups, the classification shows that the representations found in (i) are not
tempered. The Langlands parameters (cf. [BW, Ch.VI Theorems 3.2, 4.5, 4.11]
for SO(2k + 1, 1), SO(2k, 1), SU(n, 1), resp.) yield for any such representation
π, and K-finite vectors v, w, the existence of a limit:

(1)                  lim     eβ(log a) |hπ(a)v, wi| = |L(v, w)| < ∞
                 a→∞, a∈A+

where L(v, w) is not always zero (it is a matrix coefficient associated with the
representation of the compact subgroup M involved in the Langlands param-
eters of π); see [BW, p.131] (and pp. 10, 126 therein for the notation), or
[Kn, p.198, Lemma 7.23]. Notice also that dim A = 1 is helpful here, for the
clean expression in (1). By a standard argument (see (2) in §4.III below),
one shows, using the K-finiteness of v, w, that there is C < ∞ such that the
expression inside the limit (1) is bounded by C if π(a) is replaced by π(g),
and log a by log a(g) (defined in (2) of §2.I), for any g ∈ G. This, together
with the expression for the Haar measure in terms of polar coordinates (see
(5) of §2), shows that for p = δ(G), the K-finite matrix coefficients are all in
Lp+ǫ (G) for all ǫ > 0. We should perhaps remind the reader that the repre-
sentations obtained in the form of Langlands parameters are not unitary in
general, only (irreducible and) admissible (in our case, they will be unitary
exactly for G = SL2 (C)). However, the ones we discuss are infinitesimally
equivalent to a unitary (irreducible) representation, and infinitesimally equiv-
alent admissible representations have the same set of matrix coefficients, which
is all we are interested in here (see [Kn, p.209, p.211 Cor. 8.8]).
      Now, to show minimality of p, notice that if there exists a K-finite matrix
coefficient in Lr (G) for some r < δ(G), then applying Theorem 2.1 (2) and then
[Co2, p.157 Cor. 2.2.4], yields a contradiction to the nonidentically vanishing
of L(v, w) in (1). This completes step (ii). We only remark that a more subtle
question is whether the above matrix coefficients are not in Lδ(G) , but only in
Lδ(G)+ǫ . This is indeed the case, and would refine our geometric applications
if it could be shown to hold in the more general situation discussed in step (iv)
below (compare with the proof of the second part of Theorem 1.5, in §5.II,
where this refinement holds and is used). However for our purposes here, this
issue does not arise, as the definition of p(G) considers the infimum of p’s,
which will be δ(G) regardless of such a refinement.

     (iii) Lp -integrability of all matrix coefficients for the representations in (i).
Recall that since we are still dealing with irreducible representations, having
one or a dense set of Lp -matrix coefficients is equivalent. By Theorem 2.1 it
follows that the same p computed in step (ii) is the minimal value for the Lp
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                        147

integrability of all the matrix coefficients (there might be matrix coefficients
lying in Lp(G) rather that in Lp(G)+ǫ for all ǫ > 0, but as remarked in (ii) above,
this has no bearing on the computation of p(G)).

     (iv) Passing from irreducible
                            R⊕       to general representations. If G is a locally
compact group and π =           πx is a direct integral decomposition into irre-
ducibles, it is in general possible that π is strongly Lp for some p < ∞, but
none of the πx have this property (e.g., G = R, π = L2 (G)). The situation
with simple Lie groups is different, and from Theorem 2.1 we moreover get the
sharp result required for the groups of interest to us; as long as p ≥ 2, almost
every πx is strongly Lp for the same value of p.              R⊕
     Next, consider a direct integral decomposition π =           πx , and suppose
        1
that H (G, π) 6= 0. It is not true in general that for a set x of positive measure
one must have H 1 (G, πx ) 6= 0. However this is true, by a result of Guichardet,
if we replace H 1 with the reduced cohomology H 1 (cf. [Gu, Ch.3, §2] for the
precise notions and results, and also the proof after Theorem 1.7). It is easy
to see that H 1 coincides with H 1 if the representation π does not weakly
contain the trivial representation (cf. [Sh2, 1.6]). However, every strongly
Lp representation (p < ∞) of a nonamenable group has the latter property.
Briefly, this follows by examination of the n-fold tensor power σ = π n for some
integer n > p/2. Using Hölder inequality, one shows that σ is strongly L2 ;
hence by [CHH] it is weakly contained in the regular representation. But if π
contains weakly the trivial representation, then so does σ, which together with
the previous argument shows that the same holds for the regular representation,
contradicting nonamenability (see e.g. the proof of Theorem C in [Sh3]).     R ⊕We
can now deduce from this and the foregoing discussion, that if π =              πx
is a representation of G = SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1), which is both strongly Lp
(2 ≤ p < ∞) and satisfies H 1 (G, π) 6= 0, then there is an irreducible πx with
the same properties; so by (iii) we have p ≥ δ(G). This completes the proof of
Theorem 4.2.

      Let us say a few words concerning the situation for a general simple Lie
group with finite center G, and all values of n, when estimating the value of
pn (G) in Definition 4.1. The general problem of describing all unitary rep-
resentations with nontrivial cohomology (in all degrees), for any simple Lie
group G, is a well-studied one. It is known that for any G, only irreducible π
for which the center of the universal enveloping algebra acts as in the trivial
representation, may have H n (G, π) 6= 0 for some n, and that these are finite
in number. Vogan and Zuckerman [VZ] established a general (but explicit)
method of describing all such unitary representations, for any G (although the
unitarity of all their constructions was proved only later by Vogan). In [VZ]
it is also shown how to locate the constructions in the Langlands classifica-
148                             YEHUDA SHALOM


tion. Thus, the problem of classification is as much solved as one can expect,
in complete generality, hence step (i) may be carried out in general. Next,
as mentioned earlier, once the Langlands parameters are known, it is an easy
matter to determine the exact decay of K-finite matrix coefficients along the
Cartan subgroup, thereby getting a sharp value for p in step (ii). Steps (iii)
and (iv) reveal the fundamental differences which occur in this more general
framework. Due to the lack of (knowledge of) Theorem 2.1 for other G’s, we
can only assert in general, using Cowling’s “Kunze-Stein phenomenon” [Co1],
that the value of p may decrease up to the closest even integer in the process
of passing to all matrix coefficients and all representations, thereby giving only
an interval of length (at most) 2 for the value of pn (G). Moreover, in the
case n ≥ 2, to pass from irreducible to general representations in (iv), one
has to work originally with reduced cohomology, rather than the ordinary one
(which requires more effort in a later stage, when transferring this property to
lattices), or establish a general criterion, as the one we had for H 1 , relating
the two notions. This strategy seems possible at least when n = Rank(G),
however, we shall not pursue here further this direction.
     Before presenting a different approach to proving Theorem 4.2, let us
consider the general case p(G) = 0, and in particular that of G = SL2 (R).

     4.3 Theorem. For a locally compact group G, the following properties
are equivalent:
(1) p(G) = 0;
(2) p(G) < 2;
(3) H 1 (G, L2 (G)) 6= 0.
If either G = SL2 (R), or G is amenable and noncompact, then (1)–(3) are satis-
fied. When G is a finitely generated nonamenable group, (1)–(3) are equivalent
to nonvanishing of the first ℓ2 -Betti number.

     Proof. Clearly (1) ⇒ (2) and (3) ⇒ (1) (the regular representation has a
dense set of matrix coefficients with compact support). The fact that
(2) ⇒ (3) follows from a well-known result (cf. [HT, Ch.V, 1.2.4]): any unitary
representation with a dense subspace of matrix coefficients which are square
integrable, can be embedded in a multiple of the regular representation. We
only remark that because matrix coefficients are bounded, Lp -integrability for
p < 2 implies square integrability, and that one has H 1 (G, ∞ · π) 6= 0 if and
only if H 1 (G, π) 6= 0.
     Since SL2 (R) has (two) discrete series representations with nontrivial first
cohomology ([BW, Ch.VI]), (3) is satisfied. It is also satisfied by any amenable
noncompact group, by a result of Guichardet [HV, p.48] (every representation
which contains weakly, but not properly, the trivial representation, has non-
                  RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       149

vanishing first cohomology). The last assertion is due to Bekka and Valette
[BV].

     We now turn to discuss a more illuminating approach to the proof of The-
orem 4.2 for G = SO(n, 1), explaining better the connection between p(G) and
δ(G). We shall avoid classification, and give explicit geometric constructions
of representations achieving the bound p(G). Some of the results established
along the way will also be used in the sequel.

    4.4 Proposition. For G = SO(n, 1), p(G) ≤ δ(G).

     Proof. By Theorem 4.3 we may assume n ≥ 3. Recall that many lattices
(uniform and nonuniform) Γ < SO(n, 1) admit an amalgam decomposition
Γ = A ∗C B, where C is a lattice in SO(n − 1, 1). Constructions of such
decompositions go back to Millson [Mi]. Explicit and well-known ones appear
in [GPS], where the nonarithmetic lattices share this property virtually by
their construction. It can be shown (see the discussion in §5.I below), that for
any group Γ and a decomposition Γ = A ∗C B, one has H 1 (Γ, ℓ2 (Γ/C̃)) 6= 0,
where C̃ < C has index at most 2. Thus, taking a uniform lattice Γ, with an
amalgam decomposition as above, we may induce the Γ-representation ℓ2 (Γ/C)
to G, and from 3.5 deduce that H 1 (G, L2 (G/C)) 6= 0. However, recalling that
C is a lattice in SO(n − 1, 1), we have δ(C) = n − 1 − 1 = n − 2. From
Theorem 2.10 it follows that L2 (G/C) is strongly Lδ(G) ; hence by definition,
p(G) ≤ δ(G).

     4.5 Theorem. Suppose that G = SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1), and that H is ei-
ther a group of this type, embedded naturally in G (as described at the beginning
of Section 2), or any infinite discrete subgroup. Then p(H) ≤ δ(H)
                                                                 δ(G) p(G).

    Proof. Assume first that p(G) ≥ 2 and let π be a G-representation which
                                                     δ(H)
                                                            p
is strongly Lp for p ≥ 2. Then π|H is strongly L δ(G) (if H is discrete use
Corollary 2.9; in the other case use Theorem 2.1 and expression (5) for the
Haar measure). The result then follows from Theorem 3.4. If p(G) < 2, then
using Theorem 4.3 and the fact that L2 (G)|H is a multiple of L2 (H), we get,
applying Theorem 3.4 again, that p(H) = p(G) = 0, as required.

     Remark. A posteriori, once we have established p(G) = δ(G) (or at least
p(G) ≤ δ(G)), it follows from Theorem 4.5 that p(Λ) ≤ δ(Λ) for every infinite
discrete subgroup Λ < SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1).

    4.6 Lemma. If G = SO(3, 1)(∼
                               = SL2 (C)) and Γ < G is a lattice, then
p(G) ≥ 2 and p(Γ) ≥ 2.
150                              YEHUDA SHALOM


     Proof. If the conclusion fails either for G or for Γ, we have by Theorem
4.3: H 1 (G, L2 (G)) 6= 0, H 1 (Γ, ℓ2 (Γ)) 6= 0, resp. The first case is reduced to
the second by restricting the regular representation (and using, say, Theorem
3.4). However the second is impossible by [BV, Th. D], if we go back to the
vanishing of the first ℓ2 -Betti number for these lattices.

    4.7 Corollary. For G = SO(n, 1), n ≥ 3, p(G) ≥ δ(G). Hence, by
Proposition 4.4, p(G) = δ(G).

    Proof. If n ≥ 3 and p(G) < δ(G), then with H = SO(3, 1) in Theorem 4.5
we get p(H) < δ(H) = 2, which contradicts Lemma 4.6.

      4.8 Corollary. For G = SU(n, 1), n ≥ 3, p(G) ≥ δ(G).

    Proof. The argument is similar to that in 4.7, with H = SO(3, 1) <
SU(n, 1).

    The difference between the families SO(n, 1) and SU(n, 1), is that we are
not aware of any natural construction of representations of the latter, as in
Proposition 4.4, for which one easily verifies p(G) = δ(G).

     II. p(Γ): Proof of Theorem 1.9 for lattices. The proof of the following
result illustrates why it was essential to define p(G), when G is a simple Lie
group, for an arbitrary dense subspace of matrix coefficients, and not restrict
to K-finite ones.

     4.10 Lemma. Let G be a locally compact group and Γ < G a lattice. If
π is a unitary Γ-representation which is strongly Lp for p ≥ 1, then IndG
                                                                        Γ π is
also strongly Lp .

     Proof. Let µ be the Haar measure of G and X be a fundamental domain
for Γ in G: G = XΓ. We normalize µ such that µ(X) = 1 and denote its
restriction to X by µX . Let α: G × X → Γ be the associated cocycle (see
(3) in Section 3 – we shall use freely the notation of that section). Let H
be the representation space for π, and H0 ⊂ H the assumed dense subspace.
It suffices to show that if ϕ, ψ: X → H0 take only finitely many values, then
hgϕ, ψi ∈ Lp+ε (G) for all ε > 0, as the subspace of those vectors is clearly
dense.
     Let F = {ui } ⊂ H0 be the (finite) set of vectors in the image of ϕ and
                                       P
ψ, and define for every γ ∈ Γ: f (γ) =   |hπ(γ)ui , uj i|. By our assumption on
                                         i,j
π it is clear that f (γ) ∈ ℓp+ε (Γ) for all ε > 0. Next, consider the measure λ
                  RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                                151

on Γ pushed by α from G × X: λ = α∗ (µ × µX ). In other words, λ{γ} is the
µ × µX measure of all the pairs (g, x) ∈ G × X for which α(g, x) = γ. We
claim that λ{γ} = α∗ (µ × µX ){γ} = 1, namely, that λ is just the counting
measure on Γ. To verify this it is enough, by Fubini, to show that for every
fixed x0 ∈ X, the set of g ∈ G satisfying α(g, x0 ) = γ has measure 1. Indeed,
α(g, x0 ) = γ ⇔ gx0 γ ∈ X ⇔ g ∈ Xγ −1 x−1
                                        0 . We can now compute:
    Z                     Z Z
      |hgϕ, ψi|p+ε dµ(g) = | hα(g−1 , x)ϕ(g−1 x), ψ(x)idµX (x)|p+ε dµ(g)
   G                        G     X
                         Z Z
                        ≤ ( |hα(g−1 , x)ϕ(g−1 x), ψ(x)i|dµX (x))p+ε dµ(g)
                            G   X
                            Z Z
                        ≤             |hα(g−1 , x)ϕ(g−1 x), ψ(x)i|p+ε dµX (x)dµ(g).
                            G X

Making a change of variables: γ = α(g−1 , x), and recalling the definition of f ,
we may continue to complete the proof:
                        X
                      ≤      f (γ)p+ε dλ(γ) < ∞.
                            γ∈Γ


     Notice that for all discrete subgroups Γ < G = SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1), we have
established an inequality p(Γ) ≤ δ(Γ) ≤ δ(G) = p(G) (by Theorems 4.2 and
4.5). We can now show that for lattices equality always holds.

      4.11 Theorem. Let G be a locally compact group and Γ < G a uniform
lattice. Then for every n ∈ N, pn (Γ) = pn (G). If Γ is nonuniform, then
p(Γ) ≤ p(G), and when G is a connected simple Lie group, p(Γ) = p(G) as
well.

      Proof. For the inequality pn (Γ) ≤ pn (G) (Γ uniform), one only needs
to verify that the restriction of a strongly Lp representation from G to Γ is
still strongly Lp (this holds for any closed subgroup Γ; see [Ho, 6.4]), and
that for a representation π with H n (G, π) 6= 0, one has H n (Γ, π|Γ ) 6= 0. For
the second claim, notice that for every uniform lattice Γ in a locally compact
group G, (2) in Theorem 1.10 holds (cf. [Gu, III §4]). Since for every G-
representation π, one has IndG         ∼       2                     2
                                 Γ π|Γ = π ⊗ L (G/Γ), and 1G ⊂ L (G/Γ), we
have π ∼ = π ⊗ 1G ⊂ IndG                                          n
                          Γ π|Γ ; hence by (2) we cannot have H (Γ, π|Γ ) = 0.
To show the opposite inequality pn (G) ≤ pn (Γ), use again (2) from 1.10, and
Lemma 4.10.
      If n = 1 and Γ is nonuniform, we can repeat the argument above to
show that p(Γ) ≤ p(G). Just replace the use of (3) by [HV, 3.c.19] to show
152                                YEHUDA SHALOM


nonvanishing. Finally, if Γ is nonuniform and G is a connected simple Lie
group, the cases SO(n, 1) with n ≥ 4 and SU(n, 1) with n ≥ 2, follow by
inducing the cohomological representation as above, by Theorems 3.6, 3.7.
The case of SO(3, 1) ∼  = SL2 (C) follows from Lemma 4.6, and that of
SO(2, 1) ∼
         = SL2 (R) is trivial, as by Theorem 4.3 and the above discussion,
we have 0 ≤ p(Γ) ≤ p(SL2 (R)) = 0. Since all other simple Lie groups have
property (T), we have for them p(Γ) = p(G) = ∞.


     III. First applications: Proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.5. We are now able
to pick up the first fruits of our consideration of unitary representations and
their cohomology.


     Proof of Theorem 1.1. As Λ and Γ are isomorphic, p(Λ) = p(Γ) = δ(Γ)
(by Theorems 4.11 and 4.2). Since by Theorem 4.5 we have p(Λ) ≤ δ(Λ), the
result follows.


     Next, we prove Theorem 1.5 stated in the introduction, and discuss some
further applications.


      Proof of Theorem 1.5. Assume first that Λ < G = SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1) is a
nonamenable subgroup with δ(Λ) < 2. From the remark after Theorem 4.5, it
follows that p(Λ) < 2; hence by Theorem 4.3 the result follows.
      Assume now that δ(Λ) = 2. As in the previous case, it is enough to show
that H 1 (Λ, ℓ2 (Λ)) 6= 0, when we assume the Poincaré series in Definition 1.0
converges at s = 2. By enlarging G if necessary, we may assume that it is not
SO(k, 1) for k = 2 or k = 3. Recall now from the proof of Theorem 4.2 (see step
(ii)) that G admits an irreducible unitary representation π with H 1 (G, π) 6= 0,
such that π is not tempered. Hence K-finite matrix coefficients in π satisfy
along A+ the asymptotic behavior described in (1) there. Let us extend the
decay estimate given by (1) to all G in terms of the Cartan decomposition (this
will become an upper bound, rather than precise asymptotics).
      Let v, w be K-finite unit vectors, and let v1 , ..., vn (w1 , ..., wm ) be an or-
thonormal basis for Span{Kv} (Span{Kw}, resp.). As in the proof of Theorem
2.5, for every k ∈ K there exist unique complex numbers θ1 (k), . . . , θn (k), such
                                    P
that for all k ∈ K, π(k)v =            θi (k)vi . Obviously, for all i, |θi (k)| ≤ 1. Sim-
ilarly, let τ1 (k), . . . , τm (k) be the complex functions corresponding to w and
the basis w1 , ..., wm . By (1) in step (ii) of Theorem 4.2 we know that there is a
constant C < ∞ such that for all a ∈ A+ one has |hπ(a)vi , wj i| < Ce−β(log a) ,
for all i, j. Given g ∈ G, write g = k1 ak2 where a = a(g) ∈ A+ and k1 , k2 ∈ K,
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                         153

and evaluate:
(2)             |hπ(g)v, wi| = |hπ(a)π(k2 )v, π(k1−1 )wi|
                                      X                 X
                             = |hπ(a)      θi (k2 )vi ,   τj (k1−1 )wj i|
                                X
                             =|     θi (k2 )τj (k1−1 )hπ(a)vi , wj i|
                                   i,j
                                                X
                              < Ce−β(log a)            |θi (k2 )τj (k1−1 )|
                                                 i,j
                                    −β(log a)
                              ≤ Ce              n · m.
     From Lemma 2.8 and (2) above we conclude that if the Poincaré series
in Definition 1.0 converges for s = 2, then all K-finite matrix coefficients of
π|Λ are in ℓ2 (Λ). Since this is a dense subspace, it follows ([HT, Ch.V, 1.2.4])
that π|Λ is embeddable in a multiple of ℓ2 (Λ). However, from Theorem 3.4 we
have H 1 (Λ, π|Λ ) 6= 0; thus ∞ · ℓ2 (Λ) has nonvanishing first cohomology, and
the same holds for ℓ2 (Λ) (see Theorem 4.3), as required.

     As mentioned in the introduction, there are various known results on van-
ishing of the first ℓ2 -Betti number. The case of Kähler groups, mentioned in
the introduction, is due to Gromov [Gr1] (see [ABR] and [ABC, Ch.4] for a
detailed discussion). Various other examples, including all known (and con-
jectured) fundamental groups of closed prime 3-manifolds, were established by
Lück [Lu]. Very recently, Gaboriau [Ga] showed (sharpening a result by Lück
[Lu]), that the first ℓ2 -Betti number vanishes for every group which admits an
infinite index, infinite, finitely generated normal subgroup. Together with The-
orem 1.5, this yields the following purely group theoretic consequence (which
is a classical theorem of Schreier in the case of free groups):

      4.12 Corollary. Let Λ < SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1) be a discrete, nonamenable,
finitely generated subgroup, which is either of critical exponent less than 2, or
a convergence group of critical exponent 2. Then every infinite, infinite index
normal subgroup of Λ, is not finitely generated.

      Note that the result is tight, and fails in general for divergence groups with
critical exponent 2. Indeed, many lattices Λ < SL2 (C) are known to surject
onto Z, with a finitely generated kernel.
      Finally, notice that from [BV] it follows that the family of discrete sub-
groups of SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1) with critical exponent less than 2 (or groups of
convergence type with critical exponent 2), provide, by Theorem 1.5, a new
class of groups admitting nonconstant Dirichlet harmonic functions (with re-
spect to any choice of finite generating set). For instance, by Lemma 2.7 (2)
every geometrically finite subgroup Λ < SL2 (C), which is not a lattice, satis-
154                             YEHUDA SHALOM


fies a strict inequality δ(Γ) < δ(SL2 (C)) = 2, and hence the above discussion
applies (see e.g. [KAG, Ch.III] for many such constructions). Fundamental
groups of normal Z d -covers, d ≥ 3, of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, are ex-
amples of convergence groups with critical exponent 2 (see [Re]).

                       5. Isometric actions on trees

      I. Trees, spaces with walls, and cohomology. Although our main interest
lies in actions on trees, we begin by indicating how our methods apply in a
more general framework. The main result, as well as the approach taken in this
subsection, is not original, but follows the work of Haglund, Paulin and Valette
[HPV]. Since it is of considerable importance in what follows, for completeness
we include a brief introductory discussion.
      The following notion was introduced by Haglund and Paulin [HP] as a
tool in studying rich automorphism groups of certain CAT(0) spaces. It also
unifies virtually all the known constructions of negative definite functions on
groups, which arise from geometric actions.

    5.1 Definition [HP]. Let X be a (countable) set. A wall is a partition of
X into two disjoint subsets, called half spaces. Let W be a set of walls of X.
Then the pair (X, W ) is called a space with walls, if for all x, y ∈ X, the set
W (x, y) of walls separating x and y is finite.
      Given a space with walls (X, W ), let H be the set of half spaces deter-
mined by W . For x, y ∈ X let Ex , Ey ⊂ H be the set of half spaces containing
x, y, resp. Then, by our assumption, the function on H defined by 1Ex − 1Ey
has finite support. In particular, it is in ℓ2 (H), the space of square integrable
functions on the (discrete) set H. Next, any action of a group Γ by automor-
phisms on (X, W ) induces an action on H, and thus a unitary representation
on ℓ2 (H). Choosing some fixed base point x0 ∈ X, it is easy to verify that the
function b : Γ → ℓ2 (H) defined by:
(2)                       b(γ) = 1Eγx0 − 1Ex0 ∈ ℓ2 (H)
belongs to Z 1 (Γ, ℓ2 (H)). Since b ∈ B 1 (Γ, ℓ2 (H)) if and only if b is bounded
(Lemma 3.3), we find that if for some point x0 ∈ X the function
(3)                 γ → k1Eγx0 − 1Ex0 k2 = 2#W (γx0 , x0 )
is unbounded on Γ, then H 1 (Γ, ℓ2 (H)) 6= 0. The latter condition is satisfied in
most natural examples of such actions, which we illustrate with the simplest
one, namely, an action on a tree.
     Suppose that X = T is a (simplicial) tree. Denote by V (resp. E) the set
of vertices (resp. edges). Then “cutting in the middle” an edge e ∈ E defines
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       155

in an obvious way a partition of V into two half spaces, and the resulting
space H of half spaces may be identified with the set Ẽ of oriented edges. It
is clear from (3), that (2) defines an unbounded cocycle, unless the orbit Γx0
is bounded, in which case, as is well-known, a subgroup of index 2 in Γ must
fix some v ∈ V . Summarizing our discussion, we have the following:
     5.2 Proposition [HPV]. Suppose that a group Γ acts isometrically on
a tree T = T (V, E). Let Ẽ denote the set of oriented edges. Then either Γ
fixes some vertex or edge, or the natural unitary Γ-representation on ℓ2 (Ẽ) has
nonvanishing first cohomology.
     Before discussing Theorem 1.6, we mention that an analysis similar to the
one below for trees can be performed with other known examples of spaces
with walls. These walls have typically a natural geometric interpretation in
terms of the structure of the space, as in the case of trees. Amongst the known
constructions we mention Coxeter complexes [BJS], CAT(0) cubical complexes
[NR], constructions in [BaSa] and [Bou2], and various examples of CAT(-1)
spaces in [HP] (admitting a discrete co-compact action, and a simple, locally
compact, nonlinear, nondiscrete group of automorphisms). Consequently, as
we presently illustrate in the case of trees, unbounded isometric actions of lat-
tices in SO(n, 1) and SU(n, 1) on these spaces, must admit “co-dimension one”
subgroups (measured by the critical exponent), which stabilize walls (them-
selves identified with co-dimension one geodesic hyper-planes).
      II. Proof of Theorem 1.6. We start by proving the first assertion on the
weak inequality. This result will then be used in the more refined analysis
needed for the strict inequality, which will occupy most of our attention. Notice
first that if G = SO(2, 1) then δ(Γ) = 1 and there is nothing to prove. In case
G = SO(3, 1) ∼    = SL2 (C) our method of proof fails (at least for nonuniform
lattices; this is due to the failure of Theorem 3.6 in that case), but Z. Sela has
informed us that then the theorem is known, based on 3-manifolds techniques
(which do not seem to generalize). Thus, we assume henceforth that δ(G) > 2.
      Suppose that there is no fixed vertex for the Γ-action, and consider the
unitary Γ-representation on ℓ2 (Ẽ), as in Proposition 5.2. Since Ẽ is a discrete
set on which Γ acts, we have:
                                 ℓ2 (Ẽ) ∼
                                         = ⊕ℓ2 (Γ/Γe )
where the sum is taken over the orbits, and Γe denotes a stabilizer of an
(oriented) edge in the orbit. Notice that a stabilizer of an oriented edge has
index at most 2 in the edge stabilizer; hence for the discussion of critical
exponents we may fail to distinguish between them. Since we assume that Γ
does not fix a vertex, and the result is trivial if it fixes an edge, we deduce
from Proposition 5.2 that H 1 (Γ, ℓ2 (Ẽ)) 6= 0. Therefore, induction from Γ to G
156                            YEHUDA SHALOM


(and application of Theorem 1.10 when Γ is nonuniform) yields:
                H 1 (G, IndG  2         1      2
                           Γ ℓ (Ẽ)) = H (G, ⊕L (G/Γe )) 6= 0.

     We distinguish now between two cases: if the above G-representation con-
tains weakly the trivial representation, this means that spherical complemen-
tary series G-representations from any neighborhood of the trivial representa-
tion must occur there weakly, and from the discussion in the proof of Theorem
2.10 it follows that there is a sequence of edges with δ(Γei ) → δ(Γ), thereby
proving even more than we claim. Otherwise, it follows that for some Γe one
has H 1 (G, L2 (G/Γe )) 6= 0 (see the discussion at the second part of the proof
of step (iv) in Theorem 4.2). From Theorem 4.2 it then follows that L2 (G/Γe )
can be strongly Lp only for p ≥ p(G) = δ(G) = δ(Γ), which by Theorem 2.10,
implies that δ(Γe ) ≥ δ(Γ) − 1, as required.
     The first part of Theorem 1.6 is now established. We continue our discus-
sion through a series of results, aiming at the second part, and assume that
G 6= SO(2, 1), SO(3, 1).

     5.3 Proposition. Let (M, m) be a Borel σ-finite measure space on which
G acts measurably, preserving the measure m. Assume that the natural
G-representation on L2 (M ) is strongly Lp for some 2 < p < ∞, and that it
admits an irreducible subrepresentation σ which is strongly Lp for the same p,
but not strongly Lq for any q < p. Then the unique spherical complementary
series representation πλ which is “exactly” strongly Lp , namely, the represen-
tation πλ with p(ρ − λ) = 2ρ, also embeds as a subrepresentation of L2 (M ).

     See Section 2.III for the notation and discussion of complementary series
representations, and the relation between λ and p. The relevance of Proposition
5.3 to our discussion comes via the following:

     5.4 Corollary. Let G be as above and C < G be a discrete, torsion-free
subgroup, which satisfies both δ(C) = δ(G) − 1, and H 1 (G, L2 (G/C)) 6= 0.
Let λ̃0 denote the bottom of the L2 -spectrum of the Laplacian ∆ on the locally
symmetric space C\G/K. Then λ̃0 appears discretely in the spectrum of ∆;
that is, there exists a nonzero L2 -eigenfunction of ∆ with eigenvalue λ̃0 .

     Proof of 5.4 based on 5.3. We use freely the discussion in Sections 2.III
and 2.V, regarding the connections between the critical exponent, the class one
spectrum with the associated values for Lp -integrability, and the bottom of the
L2 -spectrum of ∆, acting in the corresponding locally symmetric space. Since
δ(C) = δ(Γ) − 1, the representation L2 (G/C) is strongly Lp for p = δ(G). On
the other hand, as H 1 (G, L2 (G/C)) 6= 0, and G has only finitely many irre-
ducible representations with nonvanishing first cohomology, we deduce, using
the fact that L2 (G/C) does not admit almost invariant vectors, that one of
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                        157

these irreducible representations must appear discretely in L2 (G/C); see the
second part of the proof of step (iv) in Theorem 4.2. However, in step (ii) of
the proof of 4.2 we saw that these irreducible representations are strongly Lδ(G)
as well, and that p = δ(G) is the minimal value for which they are strongly
Lp . Therefore from Proposition 5.3 it follows that the complementary series
representation πλ0 , with λ0 = ρ − β, appears discretely in L2 (G/C). By the
connection between the class one spectrum for the G-representation, and the
Laplacian spectrum for the corresponding locally symmetric space, Corollary
5.4 follows.

     Let us postpone further the proof of Proposition 5.3, and continue dis-
cussing the proof of Theorem 1.6. Recall the following purely group theoretic
notion: For a subgroup C < G, the commensurator of C in G is the subgroup
CommC G = {g ∈ G | gCg−1 ∩ C has finite index in both C and gCg−1 }.
Notice that even if C is discrete, CommC G need not be a closed subgroup. We
shall need the following general observation:

     5.5 Lemma. Let G be a rank one simple Lie group with finite center,
and C < G a torsion free discrete subgroup, for which the bottom λ̃0 of the
L2 -spectrum of the Laplacian on the locally symmetric space C\G/K is attained
by a nonzero L2 -eigenfunction f . Then C has finite co-volume in the closure
of CommC G in G. In particular, if Γ < G is a discrete subgroup containing
C, then C has finite index in CommC Γ.

      Proof. It is a general fact about complete Riemannian manifolds, that if
the bottom λ̃0 of the spectrum of ∆ occurs discretely, then up to a scalar mul-
tiple it admits a unique (L2 -)eigenfunction, which is in addition continuous and
positive everywhere (up to a choice of sign); cf. [Su2, Theorem 2.8]. Consider
the function f˜ on G/K which lifts f from C\G/K, and fix g ∈ CommC G. Since
f˜ is C-invariant, the function gf˜(x) = f˜(g−1 x) is gCg−1 -invariant, and in par-
ticular it is C0 -invariant, where C0 = gCg−1 ∩ C. By the finite index property
of C0 , the projection to C0 \G/K of both f˜ and gf˜, is an L2 -eigenfunction of ∆
with eigenvalue λ̃0 (which is still the bottom of the spectrum). By the unique-
ness property it follows that the projections of the two functions have constant
ratio, denoted χ(g), where χ: CommC G → R∗ is a multiplicative character.
For every g ∈ Ker χ we then have gf˜ = f˜, and as the elements in G which
fix f˜ form a closed subgroup, f˜ is fixed by H = Ker χ (of course, C < H).
However, recalling that the projection of f˜ to C\G/K is square-integrable, we
see easily that the H-invariance of f˜ is possible only if C has finite co-volume
in H.
      Thus, it remains only to show that χ ≡ 1. Indeed, every g ∈ CommG C
normalizes H (which, admitting the lattice C, is a unimodular subgroup),
158                               YEHUDA SHALOM


hence its left action on H\G is well-defined, and preserves the G-invariant
measure on the latter. On the other hand, since C is a lattice in H, and
f ∈ L2 (C\G/K), the H-invariance of f˜ and the compactness of K show that
f˜ lifts (and then descends) to an L2 -function F onRH\G. Integrating
                                                                  R 2over H\G,
we   get  for all g ∈ Comm    C  the equality χ(g) 2 F 2 (x) dx =  F (gx) dx =
R 2                        G
   F (x) dx; hence χ(g) = 1, as required.

      We are now able to complete the proof of the second part of Theorem
1.6 (modulo Proposition 5.3). Replacing Γ by a finite index subgroup, we may
assume that it is torsion free. Recall that the proof of the first part of Theorem
1.6 (i.e., the weak inequality), showed that it is enough to study an (oriented)
edge stabilizer C < Γ such that H 1 (G, L2 (G/C)) 6= 0, a fact which implies
δ(C) ≥ δ(Γ) − 1. We further need to rule out a possibility of equality in either
one of the two cases in the second part of the theorem. Notice that without
any additional assumption, by Corollary 5.4 it follows that if equality holds,
then the bottom of the Laplacian spectrum on C\G/K is attained.
      Consider the case of an isometric action on a locally finite tree T . It is easy
to see that stabilizers of any two adjacent edges are commensurable, and hence,
by connectivity, all edge stabilizers are commensurable one to the other, and
the group N < Γ they generate, commensurates each one of them. It follows
from the above discussion and the last statement of 5.5, that C has finite index
in N . Since N is normal in Γ, C must be commensurated by Γ. Again by 5.5
it follows that C has finite index in Γ, which is of course impossible under our
assumption δ(C) = δ(Γ) − 1. This completes the proof in the case of actions
on locally finite trees.
      To establish the strict inequality for lattice Γ < SU(n, 1) (n ≥ 2), we call
on a result of Gromov and Schoen [GS, §9], asserting that any action of Γ on
a tree, factors on some nonempty invariant subtree, through a discrete homo-
morphism to PSL2 (R). (That result assumes nonelementarity of the action,
which is an interesting case for us as well, since otherwise it is easy to see
that there are edge stabilizers with critical exponents tending to δ(Γ).) Since
the image of such a homomorphism has positive first ℓ2 -Betti number (e.g.,
by Theorem 1.5), the asserted strict inequality follows from the next general
result, which may be of independent interest (and also sharpens Theorem 1.4):

    5.6 Theorem. Let Γ < G be a lattice, with G not locally isomorphic to
SO(k, 1), k = 2, 3. Let N < Γ be the kernel of an epimorphism of Γ onto a
group with positive first ℓ2 -Betti number. Then δ(N ) > δ(Γ) − 1.

    Proof. By [BV] (see Theorem 4.3) the regular representation of the group
Γ/N has nonvanishing first cohomology. Lifting the representation and the 1-
cocycle to Γ, and then inducing to G, yield H 1 (G, L2 (G/N )) 6= 0 (by Theorem

1.10 and the isomorphism IndG    2       ∼ 2
                              Γ ℓ (Γ/N ) = L (G/N )). The foregoing discussion
and the proof of the first part of Theorem 1.6 show first that this implies
δ(N ) ≥ δ(Γ) − 1, and secondly, if equality holds, then [CommN (Γ) : N ] < ∞
(by Corollary 5.4 and Lemma 5.5). However N is normal in Γ, so it must have
finite index, which again contradicts the possibility δ(N ) = δ(Γ) − 1.

     Finally, we turn to the proof of Proposition 5.3, which will then complete
the proof of Theorem 1.6, and with it our whole discussion of actions on trees.

     Proof of Proposition 5.3. We shall assume, only to avoid introducing fur-
ther notation, that p = δ(G) (which is the value needed in the proof of Theorem
1.6). The proof of Proposition 5.3 for a general value of p with 2 < p < ∞ is
identical.
     We shall need to return to the discussion and notation in the proof of
Proposition 2.5, taking G to be one of the simple Lie groups of interest to us,
and K < G a maximal compact subgroup. Let u = v be a K-finite vector in the
assumed irreducible subrepresentation σ ⊂ L2 (M ) = τ , and let ϕ = ψ denote
the K-invariant nonnegative function defined in the proof of Proposition 2.5
via u. It is obvious by the definition of ϕ, that we have for every g ∈ G,
|hσ(g)u, ui| ≤ hτ (g)ϕ, ϕi. While in Proposition 2.5 we have used this kind of
inequality to obtain an upper bound on the left side in term of the right one,
here we shall use it to get a lower bound on the right side in terms of the left
one. More precisely, as discussed in the proof of step (ii) of Theorem 4.2, the
Langlands classification and the fact that σ is assumed to be strongly Lp for
p = δ(G) > 2 (but not strongly Lq for q < δ(G)), imply that we may have
chosen the K-finite vector u to satisfy

(1)                      lim     eβ(log a) |hσ(a)u, ui| = C > 0.
                     a→∞, a∈A+

Therefore, in view of the relation between the matrix coefficients of u and ϕ,
(1) implies

(2)                       lim inf   eβ(log a) hτ (a)ϕ, ϕi =
                                                          6 0.
                        a→∞, a∈A+

Note that while in (1) we have C < ∞, we do not claim here (although it is
true) that the lim inf in (2) is finite as well.
     Now, the K-invariance of ϕ yields, by a standard
                                                    R    direct integral computa-
tion, that for every g ∈ G one has: hτ (g)ϕ, ϕi = ϕλ (g) dµ(λ), where ϕλ is the
spherical function of the class one representation πλβ , with λ ∈ [0, 12 δ(G)] ∪ iR,
and the positive Borel measure µ has total mass kϕk2 < ∞ (see §2.III for the
notation). Notice that by our assumption that L2 (M ) is strongly Lδ(G) , Theo-
rem 2.1, and the computations in Section 2.I of Lp -integrability of complemen-
tary series representations, it follows that µ is supported on [0, 21 δ(G) − 1] ∪ iR.
160                              YEHUDA SHALOM


The assertion of Proposition 5.3 would follow by showing that µ has an atom
at 21 δ(G) − 1, as the complementary series representation at that value of λ is
precisely the one claimed to embed in L2 (M ). Our strategy is to assume that
µ({ 21 δ(G) − 1}) = 0, and derive a contradiction to the nonvanishing in (2), us-
ing the faster decay of the other ϕλ ’s, and Lebesgue’s dominated convergence
theorem.
      Indeed, recall that for t ∈ R we have |ϕit | ≤ ϕ0 (cf. Theorem 2.2), and
for 0 ≤ λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ 12 δ(G), we have 0 < ϕλ1 ≤ ϕλ2 ≤ 1 (this well-known fact
follows, e.g., from the integral representation of the spherical functions; cf.
[GV, p.104 (3.1.15)]). Recall also that when λ is positive, there exists a finite
limit:
(3)                        lim      e(ρ−λ)(log a) ϕλ (a) = Lλ
                        a→∞, a∈A+

(this well-known fact is actually covered by the discussion in step (ii) of The-
orem 4.2; see also [GV, p. 172, Th. 4.7.4 (a)]). In particular, it follows from
(3) for λ = ( 12 δ(G) − 1)β = ρ − β and the monotonicity of the ϕλ ’s over the
positive λ’s, that for some L < ∞, all the ϕλ ’s with Reλ ≤ 21 δ(G) − 1 sat-
isfy for a ∈ A+ the uniform bound eβ(log a) |ϕλ (a)| ≤ L. Therefore, Lebesgue’s
convergence theorem may be applied to show that when a → ∞ in A+ , one
has:
                           Z
(4)                          eβ(log a) ϕλ (a) dµ(λ) → 0,

once we show that for µ almost every λ, the expression in the integrand
tends to zero. This, however, follows from (3) and our assumption that
µ({ 21 δ(G) − 1}) = 0, when λ ∈ (0, 21 δ(G) − 1], and from the bound on a ∈ A+ ,
                                                                1
           |ϕλ (a)| ≤ ϕ0 (a) = Ξ(a) ≤ C(1 + β(log a)) · e− 2 δ(G)β(log a)
for all λ ∈ iR (see (9) in §2.III). As the expressions for which the limits in (4)
and (2) are taken, identify, this establishes the required contradiction.


           6. Principal bundles, induction, and cohomology

     This section is devoted to additional preliminaries toward the proofs of
the remaining results, in Section 7. The reader may prefer to skip to that
section on first reading, after looking at Definition 6.1 below, which describes
the setting in which we shall work in the sequel.

     I. Principal bundles and induction of unitary representations. The frame-
work of principal bundles will be convenient, and we now define the exact
notion to be used.
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                      161

     6.1 Definition. Suppose that M̃ is a locally compact space, equipped with
a σ-finite Borel measure µ, on which a discrete group Λ acts properly discontin-
uously, preserving µ. Denote the Λ-action from the right, and let M = M̃ /Λ
be the quotient space. We refer to this structure as a covering (principal)
Λ-bundle M̃ → M . We say that it has a compact/finite measure base, if M
has this property. If M̃ has no topology, and the Λ-action is measurably proper
with a fundamental domain M ∼    = M̃ /Λ, we call M̃ → M a measurable covering
Λ-bundle. If a locally compact group G acts continuously (measurably) on M
and M̃ , preserving µ, so that its action on M̃ commutes with that of Λ (and
hence may safely be denoted from the left), we say that G acts by (measurable)
covering Λ-bundle automorphisms.
    Choosing a measurable section ϕ for a measurable covering Λ-bundle,
namely, a fundamental domain ϕ(M ) = X ⊂ M̃ for the Λ-action, yields a
cocycle α for any action of a group G by measurable covering Λ-bundle auto-
morphisms. More precisely, α : G × M → Λ is defined by:
(1)             α(g, m) = λ      if and only if    gϕ(m)λ ∈ X.
     The outstanding example is of course that of a discrete subgroup Λ of a
locally compact group G, where M̃ = G and M = G/Λ. Our notation then
reduces to that in Section 3.III (compare (3) there with (1) above). Exactly as
in Section 3.III, one may then induce a unitary representation π from Λ to G,
keeping the same notation IndG  Λ π (or sometimes just Indπ, where the context
is clear). The representation space is L2 (M, H), and the G-action is given
as in (4) there. Although a priori this construction depends on the choice
of X, it is easily verified that a different section (i.e., fundamental domain)
yields a cohomologous cocycle, and hence an isomorphic representation. Some
basic properties that we shall need, following standard properties of Mackey’s
unitary induction operation, are given in the following:
      6.2 Lemma. Suppose that G acts measurably on a measurable covering
Λ-bundle M̃ → M with finite measure base. Then for any unitary Λ-repre-
sentations, π, σ, with Ind standing for IndG Λ , one has:
  (i) Ind(π ⊕ σ) = Indπ ⊕ Indσ.
 (ii) If π is a mixing Λ-representation, and the natural G-representation on
      L2 (M̃ ) is mixing as well, then so is the G-representation Indπ (recall
      that a unitary representation is called mixing if all the associated matrix
      coefficients vanish at infinity).
(iii) If π is weakly contained in σ then Indπ is weakly contained in Indσ.
(iv) Indℓ2 (Λ) ∼ = L2 (M̃ , µ), where the latter is the natural G-representation
      coming from its measure-preserving action on M̃ , and ℓ2 (Λ) is the left
      regular Λ-representation.
162                                YEHUDA SHALOM


      Proof. (i) is trivial. To prove (ii), recall that it is enough to exhibit a dense
subspace of Indπ for which all diagonal matrix coefficients vanish at infinity.
The subspace considered is that of the functions taking finitely many values
(in Hπ ). Let f ∈ L2 (M, Hπ ) be such a function, {vi } the finite set of vectors
in its image, and C < ∞ a bound on the norms of all the vi ’s. Fix some ǫ > 0.
Let F ⊂ Λ be the set of λ’s for which |hπ(λ)vi , vj i| > ǫ for some i, j. By the
assumption on π, F is finite. Let X ⊂ M̃ and α: G × M → Λ be as in (1)
above. Denote Y = XF −1 = ∪Xλ−1 , λ ∈ F . Notice that Y ⊂ M̃ has finite
measure. Now, given any g ∈ G, dividing X into the subsets where α(g−1 , x)
belongs, or does not belong, to F , we can estimate:
                Z
  |hgf, f i| = | hπ(α(g−1 , x))f (g−1 x), f (x)idµ(x)| ≤ ǫµ(X) + C 2 µ(X ∩ gY ).
                X

     However, applying the assumption that L2 (M̃ ) is mixing to the charac-
teristic functions of X and Y , yields that µ(X ∩ gY ) → 0 when g → ∞. Since
ǫ was arbitrary, we are done.
     Claim (iii) is again standard; see the proof of [Zi1, 7.3.7]. Assertion (iv)
and its proof are analogous to the well-known statement IndG     2    ∼ 2
                                                              Λ ℓ (Λ) = L (G) in
the group theoretic setting. For the proof we distinguish between the G-action
on M and M̃ , by writing for the former g · m. Notice that by the definition
(1) of α, and the section ϕ, we have:

(2)                           ϕ(g · m) = gϕ(m)α(g, m).

     The space L2 (M, ℓ2 (Λ)) may naturally be identified with L2 (M × Λ)
with
 R the product     Rmeasure,  by assigning f (m)(λ) → f (m, λ). (Note that
     |f (m, λ)|2 =     |f (m)(λ)|2 = kf (m)k2ℓ2 (Λ) .) The G-action on the for-
                     R               R
M ×Λ                 M Λ                 M
mer space takes the form:

       [gf (m)](λ) = [α(g−1 , m)f (g−1 · m)](λ) = [f (g−1 · m)](α(g−1 , m)−1 λ),

and thus its action on the latter is:

(3)                    gf (m, λ) = f (g−1 · m, α(g−1 , m)−1 λ).

    Next, M ×Λ may naturally be identified with X×Λ by (m, λ) → (ϕ(m), λ).
This identifies also the spaces L2 (M × Λ) and L2 (X × Λ), and (3) now has the
form:

               gf (x, λ) = f (ϕ(g−1 · ϕ−1 (x)), α(g−1 , ϕ−1 (x))−1 λ)
                        = f (g−1 xα(g−1 , ϕ−1 (x)), α(g−1 , ϕ−1 (x))−1 λ)

(the last equality follows by substituting g = g−1 and m = ϕ−1 (x) in (2)).
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       163

     It is now clear that the map (x, λ) → xλ from X × Λ to M̃ is a measure-
preserving isomorphism, which takes the latter G-action to the natural
G-action on L2 (M̃ ): gf (m) = f (g−1 m), as required.

      II. A “transference” theorem. The following technical result will be essen-
tial in the proofs of Theorems 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7.

     6.3 Theorem. Let M̃ → M be a measurable covering Λ-bundle with fi-
nite measure base, acted upon by G = SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1), by bundle auto-
morphisms. Assume that the G-representation on L2 (M̃ ) is strongly Lp for
some 2 ≤ p < ∞. Suppose that the group Λ is torsion free, and is discretely
embedded in H = SO(m, 1) or SU(m, 1) for some m ∈ N. Identify Λ with
its image in H. Let π be a unitary H-representation which is strongly Lq for
some 2 ≤ q < ∞ (as an H-representation). Then IndG                     r
                                                    Λ π|Λ is strongly L for
          δ(Λ) pq
r = max{ δ(H) · 2 , p}.

     Proof. The structure of the proof is as follows: In the first part we show
how to convert the information given by the assumption into an Lp -integrability
property of the associated cocycle α; see (8) below. It is only in the second
part that the representation π is considered, where we show how to deduce the
required estimate from (8).
     Let ρ = ρ(H) be the half sum of the positive roots of H, namely, 2ρ =
δ(H)β (we retain the notation of Sections 2 and 3, and in particular that for
the complementary series representations πλ , discussed in 2.II). Recall that for
λ = |λ|β ∈ a∗ , 0 ≤ |λ| ≤ |ρ| = 21 δ(H), the representation πλ is strongly Lt for
t = 2δ(H)/(δ(H) − 2|λ|) (see (∗) in 2.III). By Corollary 2.9, πλ |Λ is strongly
Lt for t = 2δ(Λ)/(δ(H) − 2|λ|). Assume for the moment that δ(Λ) > 0. Let λ0
be defined by the equality t = 2, or more precisely:
                                                            1
(5)    2δ(Λ)/(δ(H) − 2|λ0 |) = 2,    equivalently,   |λ0 | = (δ(H) − δ(Λ)).
                                                            2
If δ(Λ) = 0 replace δ(Λ) by any positive value strictly less than 2, say, by 1.
Notice that in both cases λ0 < ρ and πλ0 is nontrivial. Therefore, by the choice
of λ0 , πλ0 |Λ is strongly L2 (when δ(Λ) = 0 we get that it is strongly L1 , hence
also L2 ). By [CHH] it is weakly contained in ℓ2 (Λ). From Lemma 6.2 (iii),
(iv), and the assumption, it now follows that IndGΛ πλ0 |Λ is weakly contained in
a strongly L representation, hence by Theorem 2.1 (4), it is itself strongly Lp .
               p

      We claim that by the torsion freeness assumption, one can always find a
K-equivariant section (K < G maximal compact) ϕ : M → M̃ for the natural
projection, or equivalently, a fundamental domain X ⊂ M̃ for the (right)
Λ-action, which is (left) K-invariant. Let us postpone the proof of this fact to
the end of the proof (see 6.4 below), and assume for the moment that X ⊂ M̃
has this property. Let α : G × M → Λ be the cocycle as in (1), corresponding
164                                YEHUDA SHALOM


to this X. Let v0 be the (unique up to scalar) K-invariant unit vector in
πλ0 , and consider the constant function f : X → Hπλ0 : f (x) ≡ v0 , in the
representation space L2 (X, Hπλ0 ) of IndG
                                         Λ πλ0 |Λ . Then f is K-invariant for the
G-action (this follows only from K-invariance of X), so by Theorem 2.1 and
the fact (established above) that this representation is strongly Lp , we get for
every ε > 0:
       Z Z                     Z Z
(6)       | hgf, f idx| dg = | hπλ0 α(g−1 , x)v0 , v0 idx|p+ε dg < ∞.
                       p+ε

       G   X                       G   X

However, recall from (11) in Section 2 (and the remark thereafter), that for
some constant C > 0 :
                                            −1 ,x))
(7)            0 < C · e(λ0 −ρ) log a(α(g             ≤ hπλ0 α(g−1 , x)v0 , v0 i.

Thus, substituting (7) in (6) we deduce that for all ε > 0:
                   Z Z
                                         −1
                     ( e(λ0 −ρ) log a(α(g ,x)) dx)p+ε dg < ∞
                     G    X

or equivalently, by (5):
                   Z Z
                          1                −1
(8)                  ( e− 2 δ(Λ)β log a(α(g ,x)) dx)p+ε dg < ∞.
                    G     X

     Moving on to the second part of the proof, let π be some unitary
H-representation which is strongly Lq . If qδ(Λ)/δ(H) ≤ 2 then from Corollary
2.9, π|λ is strongly L2 . By the argument above, IndG                        p
                                                          Λ π|Λ is strongly L , so we
                                                        δ(Λ)
have nothing to prove. Otherwise we have r = δ(H)            · pq
                                                                2 > p. Let H0 ⊂ H
be the (dense) subspace of K-finite vectors. Then, as in the proof of 4.10, the
subspace of functions f : X → H0 which take finitely many values is dense,
and it suffices to prove that the matrix coefficient associated with any two such
functions is in Lr+ε (G), for all ε > 0 (where r is as in the theorem).
     Let then ϕ, ψ : X → H0 be two such functions, and F = {ui } ⊂ H0 be
the finite set of (K-finite) vectors in their image. Then, for every θ > 0 we can
find, by Theorem 2.1, a constant Cθ < ∞, such that for every h ∈ H:
                                                   δ(H)
                                                 (− q +θ)β log a(h)
                    X
(9)                     |hπ(h)ui , uj i| < Cθ · e                   .
                    i,j

     Fix some “small” θ for the moment. Choose any r0 > r, and take p0 > p
such that t = pr00 > pr . As we assume now that r > p, we have t > 1. By
Hölder inequality and the assumption that X has finite total measure (which
may assumed to be one), we have for every positive function f : X → R, the

inequality ( f dx)r0 ≤ ( f t dx)p0 . Applying this and (9) yields (arguing as in

    In light of (8), the last integral converges once −t δ(H)         1
                                                           q + tθ < − 2 δ(Λ), or
θ < δ(H)    1 δ(Λ)
      q − 2 t . The right-hand side in the latter inequality would be zero for
t = r/p, by definition of (and our current assumption on) r. Since t > r/p, the
integral would indeed converge had θ > 0 been taken small enough (according
to the choice of r0 and p0 , which has to be made first). Since r0 > r is arbitrary,
the theorem follows. We have only to complete the following unfinished point
in the proof:
    6.4 Lemma. With the notation of Theorem 6.3, one can always find a
measurable K-equivariant section ϕ : M → M̃ .
    The result is standard, but we failed to find a reference. For completeness
we sketch the proof (note that the torsion freeness assumption is necessary).
      Proof. Let ψ : M → M̃ be a section and α : K ×M → M̃ the associate co-
cycle. Consider the induced representation IndK   2
                                               Λ ℓ (Λ), which as in the proof of
(iv) in Lemma 6.2, is isomorphic to the K-representation on L2 (M × Λ), where
K acts on M × Λ by k(m, λ) = (km, α(k, m)−1 λ). Since K is compact, such a
representation must have a nonzero invariant vector. Suppose for the moment
that K acts ergodically on M . Then, as stabilizers of nonzero vectors in ℓ2 (Λ)
(for the Λ-regular representation) must be trivial (by torsion freeness), we get
from Zimmer’s cocycle reduction lemma [Zi1, 5.2.11], that α is cohomologous
to a cocycle taking values in e ∈ Λ. Equivalently, for some f : M → Λ we
have f (m)−1 α(k, m)f (km) = e for all k ∈ K and (almost all) m. The section
ϕ(m) = ψ(m)f (m) then satisfies ϕ(km) = kϕ(m) as required. In general, of
course, the K-action on M is not ergodic, but one can use the above argument
for each ergodic component (which is just an orbit). The proof of Lemma 6.4,
and hence that of Theorem 6.3, is now complete.
      III. The bundle-induction operation on the first cohomology. Our goal here
is to show that under suitable conditions, one has an injection of H 1 (Λ, π) into
H 1 (G, IndGΛ π). As in Section 3.III, we first need to know that an appropriate
map between the cohomology groups exists, and then study its properties. The
question of existence of the map is completely analogous to that in Section 3.III.
The notation and arguments used there apply here verbatim, and in particular
166                              YEHUDA SHALOM


condition (10) there ensures that the map b → b̃ defined in (5) yields a well-
defined linear map H 1 (Λ, π) → H 1 (G, IndG
                                           Λ π). To summarize these facts, we
have:

     6.5 Proposition. Let M̃ → M be a measurable covering Λ-bundle, acted
upon by G by bundle automorphisms. If there exists a fundamental domain X
for which the corresponding cocycle α : G × X → Λ satisfies condition (10)
in Section 3, then the map b → b̃ from H 1 (Λ, π) to H 1 (G, IndG      Λ π) in (5) is
well-defined. In particular, this is the case if α(g, ·) takes finitely many values
for every g ∈ G, and X (equivalently M ) has finite measure. Consequently, if
M̃ → M is a (continuous) covering Λ-bundle with compact base, this condition
is satisfied.

     Once the map between the first cohomology groups is well-defined, we
may inquire as to when it is injective. This will not always be the case, and
our next purpose is to describe a situation where it is. To this end we have
the following:

     6.6 Lemma. Let G be a locally compact group, (π, H) a unitary G-rep-
resentation, and b ∈ Z 1 (G, π) a cocycle. Then the following conditions are
equivalent:
 (i) If g → ∞ in G then kb(g)k → ∞ in H.
(ii) The associated isometric G-action ρ on H is proper (see Section 3.I).
(iii) There is one vector v ∈ H such that kρ(g)vk → ∞ whenever g → ∞.
    When one (and hence all) of these conditions hold, we call the cocycle b
proper. If G is not compact, and b is proper, then b is not a coboundary.

     The verification of the lemma is simple and we omit it. The following
result is a little more general than the one we shall actually need here, but it
will also be used elsewhere.

     6.7 Lemma. Let M̃ → M be a measurable Λ-bundle with a base of finite
measure (denoted µ), on which a locally compact group G acts by bundle au-
tomorphisms. Suppose that for the associated cocycle α : G × M → Λ, the
following two conditions are satisfied:
 (i) α(g, ·) takes finitely many values in Λ, for any g ∈ G.
(ii) For every sequence gi → ∞ and λ ∈ Λ, µ{m ∈ M |α(gi , m) = λ} → 0.
Then for every unitary Λ-representation π, condition (10) in Section 3 is sat-
isfied, and for every proper cocycle b ∈ Z 1 (Λ, π), the cocycle b̃ ∈ Z 1 (G, IndG
                                                                                 Λ π)
is proper as well.
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                      167

    Furthermore, conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied if M̃ → M is a covering
Λ-bundle with compact base (Def. 6.1), where the cocycle α corresponds to a
bounded section, and the natural G-representation on L2 (M̃ ) is mixing.

     Proof. For the first assertion see Proposition 6.5. To show the second, we
switch to the framework of isometric actions and use condition (iii) in Lemma
6.6. Denote by ρ the isometric action of Λ on H which corresponds to b, and let
v ∈ H be any vector. Consider the constant function f (m) ≡ v in L2 (M, H).
By the assumption on b, we may find for every C < ∞ a finite set F ⊂ Λ, such
that for every λ outside F one has kρ(λ)vk > C. Given a sequence gi → ∞,
by assumption (ii) we have for all i large enough
                                                 1
                     µ{m ∈ M |α(gi−1 , m) ∈ F } < µ(M ),
                                                 2
which gives
                                                            1
              Z
                  kρ ◦ α(gi−1 , m)f (gi−1 m)k2 dµ(m) > C 2 · µ(M ).
                                                            2
              M

      Finally, in the assumed topological covering bundle situation, it is clear
that condition (i) is satisfied. To establish (ii) denote by X ⊂ M̃ the image of
a bounded section of the bundle, and fix λ ∈ Λ. Then the mixing assumption
implies that µ(X ∩ gi (Xλ−1 )) → 0, which is exactly the condition asserted
in (ii).

                  7. Proofs of Theorems 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7

      I. Proof of Theorem 1.4. Retain the notation in the statement of the the-
orem. Denote N = Kerϕ, Λ = Imϕ, Λ ∼      = Γ/N . Since Λ is linear, by passing to
a subgroup of finite index in Λ (and then in Γ), we may and shall assume that it
is torsion free. Consider the natural projection (covering) map M̃ = G/N →
M = G/Γ, which is naturally a Λ-bundle (Definition 6.1), using the (well-
defined) Λ-action on G/N from the right. Of course, G acts from the left by
Λ-bundle automorphisms. Suppose now that π is some unitary Λ-represent-
ation. Then there are two ways to induce π to a G-representation. The first is
as in the procedure described in Section 6.I, with G acting by Λ-bundle auto-
morphisms. The second is by consideration of π as a Γ-representation factoring
through its projection to Λ, and then by induction as in Section 3.III, accord-
ing to the usual Mackey’s construction. It is an easy exercise, which we leave
for the reader to verify, that these two ways yield (naturally) isomorphic repre-
sentations. We shall need in the sequel both constructions: the first to control
Lp -integrability of the induced representation (making use of Theorem 6.3),
and the second to deduce that the first cohomology injects, if Γ is nonuniform
as well, applying Theorem 1.10.
168                              YEHUDA SHALOM


     First, notice that the statement of the theorem is trivial if G = SO(3, 1),
for the first summand is at least 21 δ(Γ) and the second is at least 1. If δ(Γ) ≤ 2
we clearly have the inequality asserted there. Thus, we may exclude that
group, and deduce from the foregoing discussion and Theorem 1.10, that for
any lattice Γ < G, uniform or not, we have for every unitary Λ-representation
σ, an isomorphism H 1 (Λ, σ) ∼   = H 1 (G, IndGΛ σ).
     The case δ(Λ)  2   <  1, namely,   δ(Λ)  <   2, is dealt with by Theorem 5.6
and Theorem 1.5, which in fact yield a strict inequality. We may therefore
assume that δ(Λ) ≥ 2. Let π be an irreducible unitary H-representation with
H 1 (H, π) 6= 0. By (the proof of) Theorem 4.2, π is strongly Lq for q = δ(H).
Recall that we have M̃ ∼     = G/N . By Theorem 2.10 the G-representation on
  2      ∼
L (M̃ ) = L (G/N ) is strongly Lp for p = p0 = max{2, δ(G)/δ(G) − δ(N )}.
               2

Thus, we may substitute this p = p0 , and the above value of q, in Theorem
                                                              δ(Λ) p0 q          p0
6.3. It follows that IndG                    r
                          Λ π|Λ is strongly L for r = max{ δ(H) · 2 , p0 } = δ(Λ) 2
(as we are assuming δ(Λ) ≥ 2). On the other hand, by Theorem 3.4 we have
H 1 (Λ, π|Λ ) 6= 0, and hence, by the discussion at the beginning of the proof,
H 1 (G, IndG                                                     G
            Λ π|Λ ) 6= 0. Theorem 4.2 now implies that IndΛ π|Λ is strongly L
                                                                                   r

only if r ≥ δ(G) = δ(Γ). Comparing this with the above value of r, we see
that we must have δ(Λ) p20 ≥ δ(Γ). Substituting for p0 we deduce:
                             δ(Λ)
(1)                 δ(Γ) ≤        max{2, δ(Γ)/δ(Γ) − δ(N )}.
                               2
     Now, if δ(Γ)/δ(Γ) − δ(N ) ≤ 2 then (1) implies that δ(Γ) ≤ δ(Λ), which is
just what the theorem claims. Otherwise, we conclude:

      1                                                                1
δ(Γ) ≤ δ(Λ)δ(Γ)/δ(Γ) − δ(N )           and hence      δ(Γ) − δ(N ) ≤     δ(Λ),
      2                                                                2
which completes the proof of the theorem.

     Finally, let us discuss the observation made in the introduction, following
Theorem 1.4. The starting point of this construction is the existence of homo-
morphisms of certain lattices in SO(n, 1) (for all n ≥ 2), onto nonabelian free
groups; see e.g. [Lub2]. Suppose that ϕ : Γ → F is such a homomorphism,
and denote by N its kernel. Notice the following general claim: If Γ/N is
nonamenable (which is the case for us), then δ(N ) < δ(Γ) (the “only if” part
holds as well, and is easier to establish). To show this claim observe that the
conclusion is equivalent to the statement that the bottom of the Laplacian
spectrum on N \Hn is positive, which is itself equivalent to saying that the
G-representation on L2 (G/N ) does not contain 1G weakly (see the discussion
in Section 2.V above). However by the assumption, ℓ2 (Γ/N ) does not contain
1Γ weakly, and we also have IndG     2       ∼ 2
                                  Γ ℓ (Γ/N ) = L (G/N ). The claim now follows
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                          169

from [Mar2, III.1.11 (b)] and the well-known fact that L20 (G/Γ) does not con-
tain 1G weakly. Now, returning to the observation, denote α = δ(N ) < δ(Γ).
Then, given any ǫ > 0, one can embed the free group F inside Γ, with a
critical exponent less than ǫ (Lemma 2.7 (3)). Taking the composition as a
homomorphism of Γ into itself establishes now the observation.
      II. Proof of Theorem 1.2. We consider first the case G ∼   = SO(n, 1) n ≥ 3,
 and then discuss the modifications required for SU(n, 1).
      Assume G ∼   = SO(n, 1), n ≥ 3. Recall that the universal cover of G,
    ∼
 G̃ = Spin(n, 1), is a two-fold covering, and hence has a finite center. We
 may thus replace G by G̃ and assume that G is simply connected. Denote
Λ = π1 (M ). Then by standard covering theory we may realize Λ as acting
discontinuously on M̃ (from the right), commuting with the lifted G-action
(from the left). In other words, M̃ → M is a covering Λ-bundle with compact
base, on which G acts by bundle automorphisms (see Definition 6.1).
      The assumption of measurable properness of the action implies that the
G-representation on L2 (M̃ ) may be embedded in a multiple of the regular
RG-representation.    Indeed, by Mackey’s well-known orbit theorem, L2 (M̃ ) ∼     =
    2
   L (G/Gx )dµ(x), where the integration is taken over the (measurable by our
assumption) set of orbits, and Gx is a stabilizer of a point x in the section (the
measure µ is the one induced by M̃ on this space). However, by our assumption,
for almost every x the subgroup Gx is compact, hence L2 (G/Gx ) ⊆ L2 (G). It
follows that L2 (M̃ ) may be embedded in ∞ · L2 (G), and in particular it is
strongly L2 (and mixing).
      Let Λ be identified with its discrete image in some H ∼      = SO(m, 1) or
SU(m, 1). Let π be an irreducible unitary H-representation with H 1 (H, π) 6= 0.
 By (the proof of) Theorem 4.2, π is strongly Lδ(H) (as an H-representation).
We now wish to invoke Theorem 6.3 for the representation π. With notation
as in that theorem, we may take by the above discussion p = 2, and q = δ(H).
It then follows from Theorem 6.3 that the induced representation IndG          Λ π is
strongly Lr for r = max{δ(Λ), 2}.
      Let us assume first that n ≥ 4; that is, G 6= SO(3, 1) ∼    = SL2 (C). Then
δ(G) = n − 1 ≥ 3. Thus, if δ(Λ) < δ(G) we have r < δ(G). On the other hand,
by Proposition 6.5 the map b → b̃ from Z 1 (Λ, π|Λ ) to Z 1 (G, IndG Λ π|Λ ) is well-
defined. Choosing b as the restriction to Λ of a non-coboundary H-cocycle, we
have by Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 6.6, that b is proper. Hence, from Lemma 6.7
it follows that H 1 (G, IndGΛ π|Λ ) 6= 0 (by the last part of Lemma 6.7, conditions
(i) and (ii) there are indeed satisfied in our case). However from Theorem 4.2 we
now deduce that IndG                                 r
                        Λ π|Λ cannot be strongly L for r < δ(G), a contradiction
which proves the result.
      We are left with the case G = SO(3, 1). Here we have to show that
δ(Λ) ≥ 2. Otherwise it follows from Theorem 1.5 that H 1 (Λ, ℓ2 (Λ)) 6= 0, and
170                              YEHUDA SHALOM


that moreover, there is a proper Λ-cocycle for the regular Λ-representation
(the latter follows from the proof of Theorem 1.5, going back to Theorem
3.4). As before we deduce that H 1 (G, IndG  2
                                          Λ ℓ (Λ)) 6= 0; hence by Lemma 6.2
(iv) H 1 (G, L2 (M̃ )) 6= 0. However as we observed at the beginning of the
proof, L2 (M̃ ) ⊆ ∞ · L2 (G). If the latter representation has nonvanishing
first cohomology, then so does L2 (G); hence by Theorem 4.3 we would have
p(G) = 0, contradicting Theorem 4.2.
      Remark. Notice that in the case of SO(3, 1) ∼ = SL2 (C), the argument
above, together with that used in the proof of Theorem 1.5, show that if
equality δ(π1 (M )) = 2 holds, then π1 (M ) must be a divergence group.
     Let us discuss now the case G = SU(n, 1). In the higher rank results
of Zimmer, an assumption of finite fundamental group is always made on G,
which is a minor restriction in view of the relatively few examples of simple
groups without this property (see [Zi2]). As we cannot afford to lose “half of
our clients”, we discuss the issue of how these groups may be treated as well,
which is not simple enough to be left untouched.
     To illustrate the necessity of a modification of Theorem 1.2 for these
groups, consider the outstanding example M = G/Γ, which motivates the
general theorem. Here M̃ =           ^1), and π (M ) =
                            ∼ G̃ = SU(n,                   ∼ Γ̃ is just the “lift” of
                                                    1
Γ to G̃, which is an infinite central extension of Γ. Having an infinite center,
Γ̃ admits no discrete embedding in a rank one simple Lie group with finite
center. Consequently, our result regarding injective homomorphisms of π1 (M )
into such groups, although strictly speaking is valid, becomes of little interest.
Analyzing the problem in the more general perspective of Theorem 1.2, ob-
serve that lifting the G-action on M , to an action of G̃ on M̃ , one easily verifies
by the construction of the lift that p−1 (e), where p : G̃ → G is the covering
homomorphism, acts on M̃ by deck transformations over M , and hence maps
naturally into π1 (M ) (possibly with kernel). Since the G̃-action on M̃ com-
mutes with that of π1 (M ), the image of p−1 (e) lies in the center of π1 (M ). As
in the preceding discussion, of “real” interest to us are those homomorphisms
of π1 (M ) which may have kernel contained in the image of p−1 (e). We shall
call such a homomorphism an isogeny, and prove Theorem 1.2 for this class
of homomorphisms. In the exemplary case of M = G/Γ, π1 (M ) = Γ̃, we see
that any embedding of Γ, when viewed as coming from Γ̃ through the natural
projection, defines an isogeny of π1 (M ), and will therefore be covered by our
analysis.
     Yet, when G = SU(n, 1), the assumption that the lifted G̃ action on
M̃ is proper (topologically or measurably) is too restrictive, as often the
G-action lifts to an action of a finite cover of G, so the G̃-action will admit
an infinite kernel. In addition, Gromov’s theorem, which is so essential in our
main application of Theorem 1.2, is not quite the same when G has an infinite
                  RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                      171

fundamental group. Rather than stating some technical general assumptions
on the G-action, which resolve the above problems, and then verify them in
our main application (Corollary 1.3), let us aim directly at this application,
relying upon Gromov’s theorem [Gr2]. The proof of the Corollary lends itself
to the appropriate generalization, and we leave this matter to the reader.

    7.1 Theorem (Corollary 1.3 for SU(n, 1)). Suppose that the connected
Lie group G has finite center, and is locally isomorphic to SU(n, 1) (n ≥ 2).
Assume that G acts on a compact manifold M , satisfying all the conditions in
Corollary 1.3. Let ϕ : π1 (M ) → Λ be an isogeny (see the above discussion)
onto an infinite discrete subgroup Λ of H ∼= SO(m, 1) or SU(m, 1), for some
m ∈ N. Then δ(Λ) ≥ δ(G) = 2n.

      Proof. Consider the lifted G̃ action on M̃ . Denote by p : G̃ → G the
covering map. The proof proceeds now in the following steps:
      1. We may assume each element in p−1 (e) acts properly on M̃ , hence the
Z(G̃)-action is proper. Indeed, by standard covering theory, every z ∈ p−1 (e)
acts as a deck transformation over M . Denoting by N ⊆ p−1 (e) the kernel of
the action, the G̃-action on M̃ factors through an action of G̃/N (the latter
still covers G, and we keep the notation p for the covering homomorphism).
Replacing G̃ by G̃/N throughout the rest of the proof, we reduce to the situ-
ation of 1. The last claim of 1 follows readily from the fact that G has finite
center, so that p−1 (e) has finite index in Z(G̃).
      2. The G̃ action on M̃ is (measurably) proper. Indeed, notice that Gro-
mov’s theorem in case π1 (G) is infinite ([Gr2, 6.1.B]; see also Remark 6.1.c
therein), asserts that the lifted action on M̃ is proper modulo the center; that
is, for almost every m ∈ M , for any sequence gi ∈ G̃ with Ad(gi ) → ∞ in
Ad(G̃), one has gi m → ∞ (we thank R. Zimmer for drawing our attention to
this crucial fact). Suppose now that for such m ∈ M̃ , there exists a sequence
gi ∈ G̃, gi → ∞, with gi m bounded. Discarding a null set, by the above we
must then have gi = zi ki , where zi ∈ Z(G̃), zi → ∞, and the ki ’s are bounded.
However then the points ki m are all contained in some compact subset, and
since by (1) the Z(G̃)-action is proper (moreover, a finite index subgroup acts
effectively by deck transformations over M ), this is impossible.
      3. Denote N = Ker ϕ. The assumption that ϕ is an isogeny means that
N ⊂ p−1 (e). By 1 every element of N acts properly on M̃ , and we may consider
the quotient M̃ /N or N \M̃ (both of which make sense and coincide, because
N ⊂ π1 (M )). We have a normal covering M̃ /N → M , and the group of deck
transformations of M̃ /N over M is naturally isomorphic to Λ. The G̃-action on
N \M̃ factors through an action of G1 = G̃/N , which is (measurably) proper
by 2.
172                            YEHUDA SHALOM


     4. The index of N in p−1 (e) is finite. Consequently, G1 (defined in 3)
has finite center. Indeed, if [p−1 (e): N ] = ∞, it follows that Λ has infinite
center. Since we assume that it is embedded discretely in a rank one simple
Lie group with finite center, Λ must be amenable, hence π1 (M ) is amenable as
well: 1 ≺ ℓ2 (π1 (M )). Inducing the latter weak containment of representations
to G1 , and applying Lemma 6.2 (iii), (iv), we get 1 ⊆ L2 (M ) ≺ L2 (M̃ ).
However, by step (3) above, G1 acts measurably properly on M̃ ; hence, as in
the proof of Theorem 1.6, Mackey’s orbit theorem implies that L2 (M̃ ) embeds
in a multiple of L2 (G1 ). But this and the previous conclusion imply together
that 1 ≺ ∞ · L2 (G1 ), contradicting the nonamenability of G1 .

     Conclusion of the argument. By 3 we see that M̃ /N → M is a covering Λ-
bundle with compact base, on which G1 acts by bundle automorphisms, acting
properly on M̃ /N . From 4 it follows that G1 is commensurable with SU(n, 1),
and in particular p(G1 ) = p(G)(= 2n). At this point, exactly the same proof
as in the case of SO(n, 1) applies.

     III. Proof of Theorem 1.7. Reversing sides for convenience, suppose by
contradiction that M = Λ\G/Γ is compact. Dividing out the finite center, we
may assume that G is (real) algebraic. Since the Zariski closure of L commutes
with Λ and satisfies the same hypothesis as in the theorem, we may also assume
that L is algebraic. In particular, by nonamenability of L, it contains a copy
of (P )SL2 (R), denoted henceforth by S. As L commutes with Λ, it acts on M
by left multiplication. Denote M̃ = G/Γ. Then both L and Λ act from the left
on M̃ , in a commuting way, so M̃ → M is a covering Λ-bundle with compact
base, on which L acts by bundle automorphisms (Def. 6.1).
     Assume now that Λ is embedded discretely in some SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1).
Let π be a unitary representation of that Lie group which is strongly Lp for
some p < ∞, and has nontrivial first cohomology (see the proof of Theorem
4.2). Then by Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 2.9, restricting π to Λ yields a
strongly Lq representation for some q < ∞, which we continue to denote
by π, with a proper cocycle b ∈ H 1 (Λ, π) (Lemma 6.6). Consider the induced
L-representation σ = IndL                                      r
                           Λ π. We claim that σ|S is strongly L for some r < ∞.
Indeed, to invoke Theorem 6.3 for that purpose, we only need to explain why
the S-representation on L2 (M̃ ) = L2 (G/Γ) is strongly Lt for some t < ∞.
For this, we use the (necessary) assumption that Λ is infinite, which implies
that Γ is not a lattice in G (indeed, by Poincaré recurrence, the Λ-action on
G/Γ would not then be proper). Therefore L2 (G/Γ) does not admit a nonzero
G-invariant vector. By a well-known result of Cowling [Co2], together with
the fact that G must have real rank at least 2 (by the existence of a simple
noncompact subgroup S which commutes with a noncompact subgroup Λ),
we deduce that L2 (G/Γ) is strongly Lt for some t < ∞. The latter holds as
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                          173

a G-representation, and hence also when restricted to any closed subgroup,
particularly, to S (cf. [Ho, 6.4]). We have thus shown that σ|S is strongly Lr
for some r < ∞, and since S = (P )SL2 (R) is not amenable, we conclude that
σ|S does not contain weakly the trivial representation ([Sh3, Th. C]; see also
step (iv) in the proof of Theorem 4.2 above). In particular, this conclusion
holds for σ as an L-representation.
     Recall that the original Λ-representation π came with an associated proper
1-cocycle; hence by Lemma 6.7 we have H 1 (L, σ) 6= 0. (By the last part of
Lemma 6.7, conditions (i) and (ii) there are indeed satisfied in our case; see
below for the second one.) We now call on a result in [Sh2], concerning the
so-called first reduced cohomology group H 1 (see the discussion preceding The-
orem 9; briefly, with the notation of Section 3.I above, H 1 is the quotient of
B 1 by the closure of Z 1 in the topology of uniform convergence on compact
subsets). On the one hand, an easy and well-known fact is that for repre-
sentations without almost invariant vectors, the two cohomology groups H 1
and H 1 coincide (cf. [Sh2, 1.6]). On the other hand, it is shown in [Sh2, 3.6]
that for any unitary representation σ of a locally compact group L, satisfying
H 1 (L, σ) 6= 0, the center Z(L) admits a nonzero invariant vector. We deduce
that the induced L-representation admits a nonzero vector, invariant under
Z(L).
     Finally, we observe that the Z(L)-action in σ must be mixing, a contra-
diction which will complete the proof of the theorem. Indeed, this follows
from Lemma 6.2 (ii), whose two assumptions are verified using Howe-Moore’s
theorem [Zi1, 2.2.20]; that theorem applies to the original Λ-representation
π, being a restriction of a representation of a simple Lie group without in-
variant vectors, and to the representation on L2 (M̃ ) = L2 (G/Γ), using our
previous observation that Γ cannot be a lattice in G. This completes the proof
of Theorem 1.7.


                8. Further remarks and related questions

     8.1. The results of Section 4 suggest the following question: Suppose that
π is an irreducible unitary Γ-representation (Γ < G = SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1), a
lattice), such that H 1 (Γ, π) 6= 0, and π is strongly Lp(Γ) (i.e., strongly Lδ(Γ) ).
Is π necessarily a restriction of a G-representation? In other words, is there
only one such π for Γ < SO(n, 1) and two for Γ < SU(n, 1)? Notice that
by [CS] the above Γ-representations are indeed irreducible (and in the case
of SU(n, 1), the two are non isomorphic). Of course, one has to exclude here
SO(2, 1) ∼ = PSL2 (R). An affirmative answer to this question would be quite
striking, and come close to a representation theoretic proof of Mostow’s rigidity
theorem. Indeed, if ϕ : Γ1 → Γ2 is an isomorphism between two lattices
174                             YEHUDA SHALOM


of G, then the Γ1 -representation π ◦ ϕ, when π is the restriction to Γ2 of an
irreducible G-representation with H 1 6= 0, is also a strongly Lp cohomological
representation, with ‘minimal’ p. Knowing that π ◦ ϕ extends to G yields
interesting information on ϕ, and the missing piece to deduce that ϕ itself
extends to G, is exactly the main result of [BiSt], proved for PSL2 (R). This
beautiful theorem in [BiSt] is trivial for other rank one lattices, once one uses
Mostow’s rigidity; however the fact that it holds for PSL2 (R), in which rigidity
is typically less seen, suggests that it might be proved independently, for other
groups.

     8.2. In view of the simplest, geometric constructions, of amalgam split-
tings Γ = A ∗C B for lattices Γ < SO(n, 1), where C is the fundamental group
of a totally geodesic, co-dimension one separating hyperplane, one is naturally
led to ask whether this must be the case whenever equality in Theorem 1.6 is
satisfied, namely, when δ(C) = δ(Γ) − 1. Such a result would be analogous to
Bourdon-Yue’s superrigidity theorem mentioned after Theorem 1.1. The anal-
ysis in §5.II provides evidence to an affirmative answer, and especially to our
(apparently weaker) conjecture that in case of equality, C must be a lattice in
SO(n − 1, 1). Recall that it was shown in §5.II that in case of equality, the bot-
tom of the Laplacian spectrum in C\G/K is attained, which yields significant
geometric information (see [Su2]). The question of existence of nonelementary
actions on trees, of lattices in SU(n, 1), seems open in general.

      8.3. Separate discussion of the different possibilities which can occur in
inequality (1) of Theorem 1.4 leads to a more illuminating result, putting for-
ward an intriguing question. Again, we shall not discuss the group SL2 (R), and
let us leave aside, for the moment, also the group SL2 (C). Retain the notation
in Theorem 1.4. By dividing out the finite center, we assume hereafter that G
is center free. Consider now the case where ϕ is not injective. Then N = Ker ϕ
is a normal, nonamenable subgroup of Γ, which seems to imply in general that
λ0 , the bottom of the spectrum of ∆ for N \G/K, is strictly smaller than its
value (δ(G)2 /4) for the symmetric space. This is the Riemannian analogue
of Kesten’s well-known theorem [Ke], asserting that for any generating, sym-
metric probability measure on a finitely generated group Γ, the norm of the
corresponding convolution operator in ℓ2 (Γ) is strictly smaller than its norm in
ℓ2 (Γ/N ), for any normal nonamenable subgroup N (the normality assumption
is crucial). We have failed to find reference for the result in the Riemannian
context, however, at our request it was recently proved in the co-compact case
by Vadim Kaimanovich [Ka], to whom we extend our gratitude. Of course, if
the bottom of the spectrum of N \G/K is strictly smaller than δ(G)2 /4, then
δ(N ) > δ(G)/2 (see §2.V and the references therein).
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       175

     Once this claim is established, one may break inequality (1) in Theorem
1.4 into a more refined version. Indeed, with the notation of Theorem 1.4, and
denoting ϕ(Γ) = Im ϕ, the following possibilities occur:

 (i) Either ϕ is injective, implying δ(Γ) ≤ δ(Im ϕ) (Theorem 1.1); or
(ii) δ(Im ϕ) < 2, implying δ(Γ) < δ(Ker ϕ) + 1 (Theorem 5.6); or
(iii) ϕ is noninjective and δ(Im ϕ) ≥ 2, implying δ(Γ) ≤ δ(Ker ϕ) + 21 δ(Im ϕ)
      (Theorem 1.4).

     The superrigidity theorem of Bourdon-Yue (and its strengthening in
[BCG]), mentioned in the introduction, yields a complete understanding of
case (i) (for uniform lattices), and it seems that not much more can be said in
case (ii), which already provides a strict inequality. Thus, if one could prove
that in case (iii), strict inequality always holds as well (which we believe to
be the case), this would show that equality in Theorem 1.4 occurs if and only
if the homomorphism ϕ extends to the ambient group. Returning now to the
case of SL2 (C), we see that, curiously enough, this superrigidity-type result
indeed holds, at least for uniform lattices, simply because δ(Γ) = 2 (relying
only on Kaimanovich’s result mentioned above). Illustration of the wealth of
situations which can occur for noninjective homomorphisms can be found in
an example of Mostow [Mo, §22], where an arithmetic lattice Γ < SU(2, 1)
is shown to map surjectively, with infinite kernel, onto a different arithmetic
lattice of that group.

     8.4. Our proof of Theorem 2.1 made essential use of the full continu-
ous strip of complementary series representations. While for the other rank
one groups, results of Cowling regarding existence of appropriate uniformly
bounded representations may serve as a substitute, for higher rank groups
some new idea seems to be required. By Cowling’s general “Kunze-Stein phe-
nomenon” [Co1], for any simple Lie group and even p, once a representation is
strongly Lp , then all its matrix coefficients are in Lp+ǫ for all ǫ > 0. However,
even for SO(n, 1) and SU(n, 1), it is not known whether for any irreducible
representation, all matrix coefficients lie in the same Lp . We remark that by
applying a general result of [KS] in addition to Theorem 2.1, it follows that
for any irreducible representation π of G = SO(n, 1), SU(n, 1), if there is one
matrix coefficient in Lp+ǫ (G), then all matrix coefficients of the smooth vectors
satisfy a decay estimate similar to (6), essentially replacing the Hilbert norm
by a Sobolev type norm. Another related question, considered by Howe [Ho]
(see the remarks preceding the proof of Corollary 7.3 there), is whether for ev-
ery p, not only an even integer, the set of strongly Lp representations is closed
in the Fell topology. Theorem 2.1 (4) yields a positive answer for SO(n, 1) and
SU(n, 1).
176                             YEHUDA SHALOM


     8.5. It is natural to look for more classes of groups Γ, for which 0 < p(Γ)
< ∞, especially with a precise estimate. By Theorem 4.5, this would yield
a lower bound δ(ϕ(Γ)) ≥ p(Γ) for any discrete faithful representation ϕ into
SO(n, 1) or SU(n, 1). Discrete subgroups of the latter groups are themselves a
rich source of examples, and especially intriguing would be to find there non-
lattices which satisfy equality δ(Γ) = p(Γ) > 0. Can one find a group Γ for
which p(Γ) is not an integer? What can be said about the numerous known
hyperbolic groups acting discretely co-compactly on CAT(-1) spaces (see [HP]
and the references cited in §5.I) ?
     Finally, as the finitely generated nonamenable groups with p(Γ) < 2
(equivalently, p(Γ) = 0), are exactly the ones having nonvanishing first
ℓ2 -Betti number, one can consider two properties which may be viewed as
“almost having” positive first ℓ2 -Betti number: satisfying p(Γ) = 2, and ad-
mitting a representation with H 1 6= 0, which weakly embeds in the regular
representation. By [CHH], the first implies the second, but they are not equiv-
alent. Fundamental groups of closed (or finite volume) hyperbolic 3-manifolds
satisfy the former, and groups which split as an amalgamated product over an
amenable subgroup, the latter.


                    Appendix: Proof of Theorem 3.7

     Although in the present paper we are interested only in SO(n, 1) and
SU(n, 1), our treatment of the problem of inducing the first cohomology enables
one to induce isometric actions on general CAT(0) spaces. In that framework,
the other rank one groups are of relevance as well. The exceptional group
F4(−20) can be dealt with by similar methods, and is sufficiently specialized that
we will not describe it here. Thus, in terms of the corresponding symmetric
space, we will work here with either the complex hyperbolic space CHn (G =
SU(n, 1)), or the quaternionic hyperbolic space QHn (G = Sp(n, 1)), where
n ≥ 2.

     1. Statement of the problem and some notation. Let X = G/K be either
CHn   or QHn . Let Γ < G be a nonuniform lattice, which we may assume to
be torsion free. (Hereafter, for convenience, we let Γ act from the left on G
and G/K.) Let F ⊂ G/K be a fundamental domain for the action of Γ. As
mentioned in Section 3.IV, such a fundamental domain consists of finitely many
cusps, and as in there, it will suffice to study the behavior of one such cusp Ω,
which we fix once and for all in what follows. Let ∞ ∈ ∂X be the geodesic ray
determined by Ω. Let {Ht | t ∈ R} be the usual foliation of horospheres which
are based at ∞. We have chosen our parameter so that the distance from Hs
to Ht is |s − t|.
                   RIGIDITY AND UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       177

     Let Γ∞ < Γ be the intersection of the cusp group P (the subgroup of
G fixing ∞), with Γ. The subgroup Γ∞ preserves each Ht , and acts on it
co-compactly (cf. [GR]). Let F0 ⊂ H0 be a (compact) fundamental domain
for Γ∞ . We define Ft ⊂ Ht to be the set of points which lie on geodesics
determined by ∞ and by points of F0 . By symmetry, Ft is a fundamental
domain for the action of Γ∞ on Ht . Furthermore, Ω is the union of a compact
part, irrelevant to our discussion (as our function is locally bounded), and, say,
∪s≥0 Fs (denoted F 0 below).
     As is well-known by now, Γ is finitely generated (again, see [GR]). We
fix a finite generating set once and for all, which may be assumed to contain
the generators of Γ∞ , and equip Γ with the corresponding word length. Given
any point x ∈ X, let w(x) be the word length of the element γ ∈ Γ for which
γx ∈ F . Finally, define the function f (p) on F , and the regions F s ⊂ F by:
               f (p) = sup{w(x) | d(x, p) ≤ 1}      F s = ∪t≥s Ft .
Our goal is to show that f is square integrable on Ω, or equivalently, on F 0
(see Theorem 3.8 and the discussion preceding it).

     2. Horospherical projection. Given t > 0, there is a canonical projection
πt : Ht → H0 . This map is defined so that the geodesic determined by x and
πt (x) intersects ∂X at ∞. Notice that πt commutes with the action of Γ∞ .
Since F 0 is foliated by horospheres, we may combine the maps πt into a single
projection π : F 0 → H0 .
     We will equip H0 with the Riemannian metric induced from the Riemann-
ian metric on X. Let B(m) be the portion of F 0 which is bounded by Hm
and Hm+1 . In other words, let B(m) = F m − F m+1 . Let B1 (m) be the unit
tubular neighborhood of B(m) in X. Let g(m) be the diameter of π(B1 (m)),
and v(m) be the volume of B(m).

    2.1 Lemma. The function f is square integrable on F 0 if the sequence
{g(m)2 v(m)| m ∈ N} is summable.

     Proof. Given p ∈ B(m) we define ĝ(p) = g(m). It suffices to show that
f (p) < C ĝ(p) for some universal constant C and for all p ∈ F 0 . If x ∈ X is
such that d(x, p) ≤ 1, then x ∈ B1 (m) and π(x) ∈ π(B1 (m)). Thus, π(x) has
distance at most g(m) from any point in F0 .
     Since F0 is equipped with a path metric, and H0 /Γ∞ is compact, H0 is
quasi-isometric to the set Γ∞ , equipped with its word metric. This is the well-
known criterion of Milnor-Svarc (see [Sc] for details). Thus, there is a universal
constant C such that a word of length at most Cg(m) maps π(x) to a point in
F0 . Since Γ∞ commutes with π, this same word maps x into F 0 .

    It remains to estimate g(m) and v(m).

     3. Estimates. As a preliminary step, we describe the Carnot metric on the
horospheres Ht (for details see [Gr3] or [Sc]). Ht has a canonical nonintegrable
distribution. This distribution has codimension one in case X = CHn , and
has codimension three when X = QHn . The Riemannian metric on X induces
a Riemannian metric on the planes of the distribution. One defines lengths
of curves, integral to the distribution, via integration. It is well-known that
every two points of Ht can be connected by an integral path, so that the infimal
length of integral paths from x to y, called the Carnot distance, is finite.

      3.1 Lemma. There is a constant C0 such that g(m) < C0 exp(m).

     Proof. The map πt preserves the relevant distributions and T (x) = exp(t)x,
for every vector x tangent to such a plane in the distribution on Ht . If follows
immediately that
                      dC (πt (x), πt (y)) = exp(t)dC (x, y),

for all x, y ∈ Ht . Here dC is the Carnot distance.
     Every two points x, y ∈ B1 (m) can be connected by a path of the form
α ∪ β, where π(α) is a point, and β ∈ Ht is integral, with t ∈ [m, m + 1]. Since
every B1 (m) can be isometrically embedded in B1 (k) for m > k, we can find
a constant C0 , independent of m, such that β has Carnot length at most C0 .
By construction, π(α ∪ β) has Carnot length at most C0 exp(m). Hence, the
path metric distance, in H0 , from the endpoints of this projected path, is at
most C0 exp(m).

      3.2 Lemma. For X = CHn , there is a constant C̃1 such that

                            v(m) < C̃1 exp(−2nm).

Here C̃1 depends on the group Γ.

     Proof. The linear differential dπt expands distances by exp(t) in all direc-
tions tangent to the nonintegral distribution on Ht . It is a well-known fact
that dπt expands distances by exp(2t) along one of the tangent vectors to Ht ,
which does not lie in the distribution. More precisely, this “extra-expanding
vector” is generated by the Lie brackets of vectors tangent to the distribution.
Thus, dπt multiplies the volume form on Ht by exp((2n − 2)t + 2t) = exp(2nt).
Put the other way, dπt−1 multiplies volumes on H0 by exp(−2nt). The lemma
now follows readily from integration.

      3.3 Lemma. For X = QHn , there is a constant C̃2 such that

                         v(m) < C̃2 exp(−4nm − 2m).

Here C̃2 depends on the group Γ.

     Proof. The proof is the same as above, except that there is now a set
of three linearly independent vectors tangent to Ht , which dπt expands by
exp(2t).

    Conclusion of the argument. Note that n ≥ 2. Therefore, by 3.2 and 3.3
we have, for the two families, v(m) < C exp(−4m). Together with Lemma 3.1,
we get
              g(m)2 v(m) < C̃ exp(2m) exp(−4m) < C̃ exp(−2m),

a sequence which is obviously summable. By Lemma 2.1 we are done.
