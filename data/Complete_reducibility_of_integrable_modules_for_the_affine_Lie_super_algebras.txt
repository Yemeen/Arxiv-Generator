Introduction
Let G be simple finite dimensional Lie algebra. Let Gb be the corresponding
affine Lie algebra and let K be the canonical central element. A module V of
Gb is called integrable if the Chevalley generators act locally nilpotently on V .
In [C] the irreducible integrable modules for Gb with finite dimensional weight
spaces has been classified. In particular any irreducible integrable module
with finite dimensional weight spaces where K acts by positive integer is
isomorphic to an highest weight module. In this work we prove that any
integrable module with finite dimensional weight spaces where K acts by
non-zero scalars is completely reducible (Theorem (1.10)).
   The integrable modules where K acts trivially, need not be completely
reducible. For example consider the Gb (without the derivation) module G ⊗
C[t, t−1 ]/(t − 1)2 where K acts by zero which is not completely reducible.
(See [E1] for the graded version).
   In section 2 we consider affine Lie super algebras and prove that most
often integrable modules with finite dimensional weight spaces do not exist.
We use stronger definition of the integrability than that of [KW]. Let G be
simple finite dimensional Lie super algebra. Let Gb be the corresponding affine
Lie super algebra. Assume that it has non-degenerate symmetric invariant
billinear form. Assume that the semisimple part of the even part of G is
at least two components. Then integrable modules for Gb with finite dimen-
sional weight spaces where center acts by non zero scalar does not exist.
(Theorem 2.6) Certainly integrable modules with K acting zero exists. For
example loop modules. Our techniques work only with the notion of stronger
integrability. We do not know whether such a result hold with the weaker
integrability of [KW].
   In Theorem (2.9), we prove that an integrable irreducible module for Gb
with finite dimensional weight spaces where center K acts by positive integer
is necessarily a highest weight module, assuming the semisimple part of the

                                        2
finite even part is only one component. In this case we note that (Remark
(2.11)) the module is completely reducible for the even part. That class
includes the affine Lie super algebras associated with basic Lie super algebras
of types A(0, n), B(0, n) and C(n).

(1.4) Lemma [H] Let λ be minimal in Λ . Then λ(β ∨ ) = 0 or 1.

Proof. See Exercise 13 of Chapter III of [H].

{µ | µǫP (λ)}. Clearly P (λ) determines a unique coset in Λ / Q. Let µ0 be
                             ◦+
the minimal element in Λ in the above coset. Let s be a complex number
such that λ(d) − s is a non-negative integer.

(1.6) Lemma Let µ0 = µ0 + sδ + λ(K)Λ0 . Then µ0 ǫP (λ).

Proof First note that by minimality of µ0 we have µ0 <0 λ. Then clearly
µ0 ≤ λ.

Claim µ0 ǫΛ+ . Consider αi∨ for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Then µ0 (αi∨ ) = µ0 (αi )ǫN as
    ◦+
µ0 ǫ Λ . Now α0∨ = K − β ∨ and

                      µ0 (α0∨ ) = µ0 (K − β ∨ ) = λ(K) − µ0 (β ∨)

Now λ(K) is positive integer and hence λ(K) ≥ 1. We know from Lemma
(1.4) that µ0 (β ∨ ) = 0 or 1. That means
                                            ∨
                                       µ0 (αd+1 )ǫN.

This prove the claim. Thus µ0 is dominant integral and ≤ λ. By Proposition
12.5 (a) of [K1] it follows that µ0 ǫP (λ).
   We need the following from [E2].

(1.7) Lemma (Lemma (2.6) of [E2]). Let V be integrable module for Gb
with finite dimensional weight spaces. Let P (V ) be the set of weights of V .

 (2) There exists η01 <0 0, η01 ǫ Λ such that λ + η01 + η ∈

               ◦
       <
     η 0 0, ηǫ Λ

Proof (1) follows from the proof of Lemma (2.6) of [E2]. The proof of (2)
is similar.

                                      b
(1.8) Proposition Let V be integrable G−module with finite dimensional
weight spaces. Assume the canonical central element K acts by positive
integers. Let λ ∈ P (V ). Then there exists η ≥ 0 such that λ + ηǫΛ+ and the
irreducible integrable highest weight module V (λ + η) ⊆ V .

Proof By previous lemma there exists η0 >◦ 0 such that λ + η0 + η ∈
                                                                  / P (V )
for 0 6= η >◦ 0. Now by arguments similar to the proof of Theorem 2.4 (i) of
[C] will produce an highest weight module with highest weight λ + η0 + η1
for some η1 ≥ 0. Note that (λ + η0 + η1 )(d) ≥ λ(d).
   In the above proof we need our Lemma (1.7) as the proof of Lemma 2.6
(ii) of [C] is incomplete. We now recall the following variation of a standard
result from [K1].

(1.9) Proposition Let V be integrable module for Gb with finite dimen-
sional weight spaces. Let K act by positive integer. Suppose for every v
                                     b α+nδ v = 0 for all n > N and for
in V , there exist N > 0 such that U(G)
    ◦
αǫ △ U{0}. Then V is completely reducible.
   We need to recall some standard notations from [K1] and prove two lem-
mas.
   The Cartan subalgebra h carries a non-degenerate billinear form ( | ). Let
ν : h → h∗ be an isomorphism such that ν(h)(h1 ) = (h | h1 ). Let <, > be
the induced billinear form on h∗ . Recall the Casimir operator from Section
(2.1), ρ in h∗ from (2.5) from [K1]. Also recall the notion of primitive weights


                                       5
from (9.3) of [K1]. Note that in an integrable module the primitive weights
are dominant integral.

Lemma A Let V be as above. Suppose λ, µ are primitive weights such
that λ − µ = β ∈ Q+ − {0}. Then 2 < λ + ρ, ν −1 (β) >6= (β, β).

Proof Follows from the proof of theorem (10.7) of [K1]. See 10.7.3 and the
next equation in [K1].

Lemma B Let V be as above. Let v be a weight vector of weight λ
such that (Ω0 − aIV )k v = 0 for some k ∈ Z+ and a ∈ C. Presumably
          ∧
v 1 ∈ U−β (G)v, β ∈ Q. Then

              (Ω0 − (a + 2 < λ + ρ, ν −1 (β) > −(β, β))IV )v 1 = 0.

Proof Follows from (2.6.1) and (3.4.1) of [K1]. Also see (9.10.2) of [K1].
Note that V is restricted in the sense of [K1].

                                    ∧
Proof of the Proposition Let G= n− ⊕h⊕n+ be the standard triangular
decomposition. Let V 0 = {v ∈ V | n+ v = 0}. Clearly V 0 is h− invariant and
                                                ∧
hence decomposes under h. Let V 1 = U(G)V 0 . It is standard fact that in
an integrable module, each highest weight generate an irreducible integrable
module. Thus V 1 is completely reducible. We will now prove thatV = V 1 .
   Clearly the Casimir operator Ω0 acts on V and leaves each finite di-
mensional weight space invariant. Thus Ω0 is locally finite on V . Suppose
V 6= V 1 . Then there exists v in V − V 1 of weight λ such that n+ v ⊆ V 1 and
(Ω0 − aIV )k v = 0 for some k ∈ Z+ and a ∈ C. Since, clearly Ω0 v ∈ V 1 , we
have a = 0 and hence Ωk0 v = 0.
   ¿From the hypothesis it follows that U(n+ )v is finite dimesnional. So it
                                            ∧
contains vector uβ v such that uβ ∈ U(G)β and n+ uβ v = 0, β ∈ Q+ − {0}.


                                        6
Let µ = λ + β and note that λ, µ are primitive weights. Thus by Lemma A.

(∗)                     2 < µ + ρ, ν − (β) >6= (β, β).

      Now by Lemma B it follows that 2 < λ + ρ, −ν − (β) >= (β, β) as
Ω0 (uβ v) = 0. This is a contradiction to ∗. Thus V = V 1 and V is com-
pletely reducible.

(1.10) Theorem Let V be integrable module with finite dimensional weight
           b Suppose all eigenvalues of K are non-zero. Then V is com-
spaces for G.
                     b
pletely reducible as G-module.

Proof First decompose V with K action. As K commutes with G,    b each
              b
eigenspace is G-module. Thus we can assume that K acts by single scalar.
It is well known that the central element K acts by integer (see for example
[E2]). Without loss of generality we can assume that K acts by positive
integer. We now decompose the module

                              V = ⊕λǫΛ/Q Wλ

                                                                        b
where µ1 , µ2 weight occurs in Wλ then µ1 − µ2 ǫQ. Clearly each Wλ is a G-
module. Thus we can assume that the weights P (V ) of V lie in single coset
of Λ.

Claim Let λǫP (V ). Then there exists η ≥ 0 such that λ + α ∈
                                                            / P (V ) for
all positive roots α such that α > η.

Proof of the claim Suppose there exists infinitely many positive roots α
such that λ + αǫP (V ). First by Proposition (1.8) there exists η ≥ 0 such
that λ + ηǫΛ+ , λ + ηǫP (V ), (λ + η)(d) ≥ λ(d) and the irreducible integrable
highest module V (λ + η) ⊆ V .


                                        7
                                                                           ◦
   Let P (V ) = {λ | λǫP (V )}. Clearly P (V ) defines a unique coset in Λ. Let
µ0 be the minimal weight for this coset. Let µ0 = µ0 +λ(d)δ+λ(K)w ≤ λ+η.
By lemma (1.6) we have µ0 ǫP (λ + η) ⊆ P (V ).
   First note that the number positive roots α1 such that α1 6> η is finite.
   Now choose positive root α1 > η such that λ + α1 ǫP (V ). (This is due
to our supposition). Now by above arguments there exists η1 ≥ 0 such
that λ + α1 + η1 ǫP (V ), λ + α1 + η1 ǫΛ+ and V (λ + α1 + η1 ) ⊆ V . Further
µ0 ≤ λ+α1 +η1 and µ0 ǫP (λ+α1 +η1 ) ⊆ P (V ). Note that λ+α1 +η1 > λ+η(
note the strict inequality). Thus V (λ + α1 + η1 ) 6= V (λ + η). Both modules
have common weight µ0 . Thus we have proved that dim Vµ0 ≥ 2. By
repeating n times the above argument we get dim Vµ0 ≥ n. But dim Vµ0 is
finite and thus this process has to stop. This proves our claim. It follows
from the claim and that the module V satisfies the conditions of Proposition
1.9 and hence it is completely reducible.

(1.11)    Remark Theorem (1.10) imply that an integrable module with
finite dimensional weight spaces in which K acts by positive integer belongs
to the category O.


Section 2
Let G = G0 ⊕ G1 be simple finite dimensional Lie super algbera G0 (re-
spectively, G1 ) being its even (respectively, odd) part. We assume that G0
is reductive. We further assume that G carries a non-degenerate invariant
“symmetric” billinear form. Such Lie super algebras are called basic. We
give the list of basis Lie super algberas from Proposition (1.1) of [K].

   In this section we study the integrable representations of the untwisted
affine Lie super algebras of basic Lie super algebras.
   Let G be a basic Lie-super algebra. Then the restriction to the even part
need not be positive definite. In fact we choose the form in such a way that
the restriction to the first component of the even part is positive definite and
the restriction to the second component is negative definite. (see section 6 of
[KW]). We normalize the form in such a way that (α, α) = 2 where α is the
highest root of the first component of the even part of G0 and (β, β) = −2
where β is the highest root of the second component. Let h be the Cartan
subalgebra of G which is contained in the even part.

(2.2)      Definition A module V of Gb is called integrable if

 (1) V = ⊕λǫbh∗ Vλ , Vλ = {vǫV | hv = λ(h)v, ∀hǫb
                                                h}

 (2) V is integrable as a Gb0 module.

 (3) For any vǫV, U(G)v is finite dimensional

Here U(G) is the universal enveloping algebra of G.

(2.3)     Remark In [KW] integrable modules are studied with weaker con-
dition. In [KW] integrability means the module is integrable only with the
affinization of one simple part of G0 . Then they have classified irreducible
highest weight module which are integrable in the above sense. See Theorem
6.1 & 6.2 of [KW].
    The purpose of this section is to classify irreducible integrable modules
for Gb where center K acts non trivially.
      Let G01 and G02 be the first and second and the simple component of
G0 as above. (In case of D(2, n) and D(2, 1; α) the first component is not
simple. Then we take one of the simple component). Let h1 and h2 be the
respective Cartan sub algebras. Let △1 and △2 be the corresponding root
system. The following is very standard. Does not matter whether the form
is positive definite or negative definite.

                           ◦
(2.4) For any root αǫ △i , let α∨ be the co-root. Let xα be the corresponding
root vector. Choose x−α in the negative root space such that (xα , x−α ) =
                                                                   ◦

      . Then   xα , x−α , α∨ is an sℓ2 triple. Let γ = α + nδ, αǫ △i . Let γ ∨ =
  ∨     2n
α + (α,α)  K   be the co-root. Then it is easy to check that xα (n), x−α (−n), γ ∨
is an sℓ2 triple.

         Lemma Let V be an integrable G-module. Let λ be a weight of V .
Let γ = α + nδ, αǫ△i such that λ(γ ∨ ) > 0. Then λ − γ is a weight of V .

                                        10
Proof Follows from standard sℓ2 theory.

(2.6) Theorem Notation as above. Assume the semi simple part of G0 has
at least two components. Let V be integrable module with finite dimensional
weight spaces. Let the central element K act by non-zero scalar. Then V is
necessarily trivial module.
   Without loss of generality we can assume that K acts by positive integer.
We can establish the following by the arguments similar to the proof of
theorem (1.10).

(2.7) For any λǫP (V ) there exists N > 0 such that
                                                          ◦
         λ + α + nδ ∈
                    / P (V ) for all n ≥ N and for all αǫ △1 ∪{0}.

(2.8) There is one problem. The module V need not have finite dimensional
                  ∧
weight spaces for G 01 as h1 ⊕CK ⊕Cd could be much smaller than the Cartan
                                                                         ∧
h = h1 ⊕ h2 ⊕ CK ⊕ Cd. To overcome this problem, first observe that G 01
commutes with h2 . Now decompose the module V with respect to h2 and
                      ∧
h2 weight space is a G 01 -module with finite dimensional weight spaces. Now
apply arguments similar to the proof of (1.10) to conclude (2.7).

Claim There exists a weight vector v of weight λ such that
xα (n)v = 0 for n < 0 and for all αǫ△2 ∪ (0).
   First we complete the proof assuming the claim. From the claim we have
h(n)v = 0 for n < 0 and hǫh2 . From the standard Hisenberg highest weight
module theory it follows that h(n)v 6= 0 for all n > 0 and for all h in h2 .
Thus it follows that λ + mδ is a weight for all m > 0 contradicting (2.7).
Thus the module V has to be trivial.




                                     11
Proof of the claim: From Lemma 1.7 (2) it follows that there exists
                           / P (V ) for all α ∈ △+
λ ∈ P (V ) such that λ − α ∈                              −ar
                                                 2 . Let △2   be the negative
               ∧
real roots of G 02 . Define △(λ) = {γ ∈ △−ar
                                         2   | λ(γ ∨ ) ≤ 0}. Then △(λ) is
                                         ◦
finite set. Indeed, let γ = α − nδ, α ∈△2 n > 0 be an element of △−ar
                                                                  2 . Then
λ(γ ∨ ) = λ(α∨) − nλ(K)/(α,α) > 0 for n sufficiently large (recall (α, α) < 0
           ◦
for all α ∈△2 ). Fix a positve integer r such that α − sδ ∈ △−a
                                                             2 − △(λ) for
s ≥ r.

Subclaim 1 λ − sδ ∈
                  / P (V ) for s ≥ r. Suppose λ − sδǫP (V ) for some s ≥ r
we have λ((α−sδ)∨ ) > 0 then by lemma (2.5), λ−sδ −(α−sδ) = λ−αǫP (V )
which is a contradiction to the choice of λ.
   Fix a positive integer p such that λ−sδ ∈
                                           / P (V ) for s > p and λ−pδǫP (V ).

                                                                 ◦ +
Subclaim 2 λ − α − (m + p)δ ∈
                            / P (V ) for m > 0 and αǫ △2 . Suppose
the claim is false. Consider (λ − α − (m + p)δ)(α∨ ) < 0 since λ(α∨ ) < 0
and α(α∨ ) = 2. Then by Lemma (2.5) we have λ − α − (m + p)δ + α =
λ − (m + p)δǫP (V ) contradiction the choice of p.

                                                                  ◦ +
                                / P (V ) for m > r and αǫ △2 . Suppose
subclaim 3 λ + α − (m + p + 1)δ ∈
the claim is false. Consider
   (λ + α − (m + p + 1)δ)(α − mδ)∨ > 0 as α − mδ ∈
                                                 / △(λ). Thus by lemma
2.5 we have
                       λ + α − (m + 1 + p)δ − α + mδ

                               = λ − (1 + p)δ ǫP (V )

contradicts the choice of p.
   Thus we have proved

           G 02,−rδ Vλ−pδ = 0, r > 0 and G 02,α−sδ Vλ−pδ = 0 for all

but finitely many negative roots. Since V is integrable W = U(Gb02
                                                                −
                                                                   )Vλ−pδ is
finite dimensional. Let µ be the lowest weight of W . This weight satisfies all
the requirements of the claim.

(2.9)   Theorem Let Gb be the affine super algebra defined earlier. Assume
that the semisimple part of the finite even part has only one component.
Further assume that the non-degenerate form restricted to this simple Lie
algebra G0 is positive definite. Let V be irreducible integrable module with
finite dimensional weight spaces. Assume the central element K acts as
positive integer. Then V is an highest weight module.

Proof From the proof of Theorem (2.6) we have (2.7). Let β1 , · · · , βk be
odd roots of G. Let v be a wieght vector of V of weight λ.

Claim The following vectors span is a finite dimensional space W

                   {xβi1 (m1 ) · · · xβik (mk )v, ij ≤ ik , m ≥ 0}

where xβi is a root vector for the odd root space G±βi . The affine roots that
are occuring in the product are all distinct. In the above we take negative
roots first and postive roots next. The indices are decreasing order. It is
sufficient to prove that the vector space T spanned by the following vector
is finite dimensional.

                   {xβ (m1 ) · · · xβ (mk )w, mi ≥ 0, mi 6= mj }

where w is any weight vector of V . This is because there are only finitely
many odd roots in G.
   First note that if kβ is a root for k > 0 then k = 1 or 2. Consider
xβ (m)w = [h(m), xβ ]w = h(m)xβ (w) ± xβ h(m)w. By (2.7) both vectors are



                                         13
zero for large m. Let m0 be such that xkβ (m)w = 0 for m > m0 and k = 1, 2.
Then it is easy to see that T is spanned by

            {xβ (m1 ) · · · xβ (mk )w; 0 ≤ mi ≤ m0 , mi 6= mj , i 6= j}

which is clearly finite dimensional.
   Let H be the center of the reductive Lie algebra G0 . Consider

(2.10)            S = U(Gb0− )U(h)U(Gb0+ )U(⊕n>0 H ⊗ tn )W.

                     Then V = U(⊕n<0 H ⊗ tn )U(Gb1− )S

by PBW basis theorem.
   By (2.7) we conclude that U(⊕n>0 H ⊗ tn )W = W1 is finite dimensional.
Clearly S is Gb0 -module and by Theorem (1.10) S is completely reducible. In
fact it is direct sum of highest weight modules. Since W1 is finite dimensional
it intersects only finitely many of them. Say V (λ1 ) · · · V (λk ). Thus S =
⊕V (λi ) a finite sum. Thus S has a maximal weight. (Here the ordering is
                                      P

roots. See [KW]). The maximal weight is in fact maximal for V as the rest
of the space brings the weights down.
   The maximal weight is in fact highest weight. As V is irreducible, it is
irreducible highest weight module.

(2.11) Remark In the process we also established that an irreducible in-
tegrable highest weight module for Gb is completely reducible for G\
                                                                   0 ⊕ H.


                                                     b Let
Proof Let V be irreducible highest weight module for G.

                Ω(V ) = {vǫV | h(k)v = 0 for all hǫH, k > 0}



                                        14
Let M(k) be the irreducible highest weight module for H ⊗ C[t, t−1 ] ⊕ CK
where K acts by k. Then by Theorem (1.7.3) of [FLM] we have V = Ω(V ) ⊗
M(k). Now Ω(V ) is an integrable module and hence by Theorem (1.10)
decomposes into irreducible modules for Gb0 . Thus the Remark follows.
