                                             1. Introduction.
                                             1.1. Amongst his many great contributions to mathematics, Alexander Kirillov was a
                                             co-founder of the “orbit method”. This exploits the symplectic structure on coadjoint
                                             orbits with respect to a Lie algebra g. From a Lagrangian subvariety one attempts to
                                             construct a representation of g associated to the given orbit. If g is semisimple, the orbit

                                                 Supported in part by the Minerva Foundation, Germany, Grant No. 8466

                                                                                          1
is nilpotent and one wishes to construct a highest weight module, then this Lagrangian
subvariety should be a so-called orbital variety. Then “quantization” of the latter leads
to the required representation [J3].
     In this paper we consider only the case when g = sln (C). By [M4] all orbital
varieties can be weakly quantized (though this fails [J3, 1.3] for arbitrary g). It remains
to show that they can be strongly quantized. This is a rather more delicate question.
We shall settle this positively for orbital varieties which are of codimension 1 in the
nilradical of a parabolic. These are called hypersurface orbital varieties.
1.2.   Let g = n− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ be a triangular decomposition. We identify n− with (n+ )∗
through the Killing form. Let G be adjoint group of g and B the Borel subgroup
with Lie algebra b := h ⊕ n+ . For any Lie algebra a, let S(a) (resp. U (a)) denote its
symmetric (resp. enveloping) algebra. It is well-known that Gn+ is a finite union (of
so-called nilpotent) orbits classified by Jordan normal form. Let O be such an orbit.
After Spaltenstein [S] the irreducible components of O ∩ n+ have dimension 1/2 dim O.
They are called orbital varieties and after Steinberg [St] are classified by the standard
tableaux whose shape is specified by O. As noted in [J1, 7.3] an orbital variety V can
be characterized as an irreducible subvariety of n+ for which the ideal I(V) ⊂ S(n− )
of definition of its closure is stable under the Poisson bracket on g (induced by the Lie
bracket).
1.3.     Retain the notation of 1.2. Roughly speaking V can be strongly quantized
if S(n− )/I(V) can be given the structure of a highest weight module (not necessarily
simple). Here the choice of highest weight is a crucial and delicate point. Take λ ∈ h∗
and let V (λ) be a highest weight module with highest weight vector vλ of weight λ. Let
F be the canonical (degree) filtration on U (n− ) (resp. on S(n− )). We say that V (λ) is
a strong (resp. weak) quantization of V if gr F Ann U(n− ) vλ = I(V) (resp. if its radical
equals I(V) ).
1.4.   In order to exhibit a strong quantization we have to compute I(V) (or at least
to calculate the formal character of S(n− )/I(V) ). In [J2, Lecture 7] the general form
that this should take is suggested. Let N be the generic matrix of n− + 1d. Then I(V)
should take the form gr F < a1 , a2 , · · · , an >, where ai are amongst the minors of N .
This suggestion derived from an algorithm for Ann U(n− ) V based on the Enright functor
[J1, 8.4] together with calculations in the thesis of E. Benlolo.
1.5.   Of course the above does not tackle the difficult question as to which minors
ai to choose. Recently Benlolo and Sanderson [BS] made an appealing conjecture for

                                            2
this choice concerning orbital varieties V having codimension 1 in the nilradical m+ of
a parabolic subalgebra p. Apart from the obvious 1 × 1 minors it follows from Krull’s
theorem that I(V) is generated by just one element f which can be assumed to be
an h weight vector. A result in [M3] describes in particular all the orbital varieties of
codimension 1 in a given m+ . Using this, Benlolo-Sanderson [BS] show that one may
reduce to the case when f cannot be expressed in terms of the generic matrices of n−
obtained by deleting the first columns and last rows. Up to this reduction they show
that m+ is given by blocks of size c1 , c2 , · · · , cl with c1 = cl = c and ci 6= c, ∀ i : 1 < i < l.
Now let M(t) be the generic matrix of m− + t1d, where m− is the opposed algebra of
m+ identified with (m+ )∗ and t is an indeterminate. Let M (t) be the (n − c) × (n − c)
minor of M(t) lying in the bottom left-hand corner. Then M (t) is a polynomial in t.
They conjecture that f is the coefficient of its lowest degree term. Let β1 be the highest
root of n+ , β2 the highest root of the subalgebra of n+ obtained by omitting the first
                                                                    Xc
row and last column, and so on. They show that f has weight − βi .
                                                                            i=1
1.6. One may note that f of 1.5 can also be described as gr F M (1). However as we
shall see there is a certain computational advantage in retaining t. (Furthermore BS
compute the lowest power of t in M (t)). One may also replace m− + 1d in the above by
n− + 1d as long as one includes the obvious 1 × 1 minors in I(V). In this sense M (1)
only depends on the first column size c. Likewise f = gr F M (1) depends only partially
on m− . In particular the weight of f only depends on c. Although BS do check their
conjecture in a number of cases, it is interesting to know if it holds in general since the
above independence is somewhat surprising. Moreover even the relatively simple case
of hypersurface varieties has some remarkable structure.
1.7. Our proof of the BS conjecture involves showing that S(m− )f is semi-prime and
its zero variety is P stable, where P ⊃ B is the parabolic subgroup with Lie algebra
p. This holds irrespective of whether ci 6= c, for i 6= 1, l. However we show that f is
irreducible if and only if this condition holds. This is a delicate point. We shall give
three proofs. One is based on a careful counting of t powers in multiplying out M (t)
and a knowledge [M2, M3] of the orbital varieties of codimension 1 in m+ . The second is
based on a representation theoretic argument combined with [M4] which asserts that the
associated variety of a highest weight module of integral highest weight is irreducible.
The third is the least computational and is based on the irreducibility of the associated
variety of the annihilator of a simple highest weight module.
1.8. We shall exhibit a strong quantization of V by determining a simple highest weight

                                                  3
module V (λ) whose formal character ch V (λ) coincides with that of S(m− )/S(m− )f and
by using the linear independence of the characteristic polynomials of orbital varieties.
To determine λ and compute ch V (λ), we use the formula of Jantzen [Ja] describing the
Shapovalov determinants defined with respect to p. Let I be the subset of the set of
simple roots Π defining p. Assume (α, α) = 2 for any root. Then it suffices to take
λ ∈ h∗ such that (λ, α) = 0, ∀ α ∈ I, (λ, β1 ) = c − (n − 1) and (λ, γ) 6∈ Z, for any
proper sum of roots in Π′ := Π \ I. However we also give a choice of integral λ. This is
more delicate since the condition ci 6= c, ∀ i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 must be invoked. Combined
with [M4] it leads to the second proof of the irreducibility of f . The non-integral case
gives our third proof.
   We further show that there is a choice of λ such that the annihilator of V (λ) is
maximal as well as V (λ) being a strong quantization of V.
1.9.     The truth of BS conjecture has the following remarkable consequence. One may
specify positive integers s, t such that f is exactly the highest common divisor of the t×t
minors of M(0)s . There seems to be no elementary proof of this purely combinatorial
fact.


2. Combinatorial Preliminaries and the Benlolo-Sanderson Conjecture
2.1 The base field is assumed algebraically closed of characteristic zero and can be
taken to be the complex field C without loss of generality.
       Recall the notation and the hypotheses of 1.1 and 1.2. Put n = n+ . In particular
an orbital variety V associated to a nilpotent orbit O is an irreducible component of
O ∩ n. Let V denote the set of all orbital varieties of g and W the Weyl group for the
pair (g, h). We describe first the Steinberg map of W onto V. Let R ⊂ h∗ denote the
set of non-zero roots, R+ the set of positive roots corresponding to n in the triangular
decomposition of g and Π ⊂ R+ the resulting set of simple roots. Let Xα = Cxα denote
                                                       L                     L
the root subspace corresponding to α ∈ R. Then n =         Xα (resp.n− =           Xα ).
                                                     α∈R +                 α∈−R  +
                                     L
     For each w ∈ W set n∩w n :=             Xα . For each closed, irreducible subgroup
                                   α∈R+ ∩w(R+ )
H of G let H(n ∩ n) be the set of H conjugates of n ∩w n. It is an irreducible locally
                    w

closed subvariety. Since there are only finitely many nilpotent orbits in g it follows that
there exists a unique nilpotent orbit O such that G(n ∩w n) = O. A result of Steinberg
[St] asserts that Vw := B(n ∩w n) ∩ O is an orbital variety and that the map φ : w 7→ Vw
is a surjection of W onto V.
2.2     It is convenient to replace sln by g = gln . This obviously makes no difference.

                                            4
Note that the adjoint action is just conjugation by G = GLn . Let n be the subalgebra
of strictly upper-triangular matrices and let n− be the subalgebra of strictly lower-
triangular matrices. Let B be the (Borel) subgroup of upper-triangular matrices in G.
All parabolic subgroups we consider further are standard, that is contain B.
     Let ei,j be the matrix having 1 in the ij−th entry and 0 elsewhere.
     Take i < j and let αi,j be the root corresponding to ei,j . Set αj,i = −αi,j . We write
αi,i+1 simply as αi . Then Π = {αi }n−1
                                    i=1 . Moreover αi,j ∈ R
                                                            +
                                                              exactly when i < j. For
each α ∈ Π, let sα ∈ W be the corresponding reflection and set si = sαi .
2.3 We represent every element of the symmetric group Sn in word form

                         w = [a1 , a2 , . . . , an ] ,   where ai = w(i).

We identify W with Sn by taking si to be the elementary permutation interchanging
i, i + 1.

Definition. Given w = [a1 , · · · , an ]. Set pw (i) = j if aj = i, that is pw (i) is the place
(index) of i in the word form of w.

    One has w(pw (i)) = w(j) = aj = i, that is pw (i) = w−1 (i). On the other hand
w(αi,j ) = αw(i),w(j) . Set S(w) = {α ∈ R+ | w(α) ∈ −R+ }.
    This gives the following result.

Lemma. Take i < j. Then αi,j ∈ S(w−1 ) if and only if pw (i) > pw (j).

Remark. In particular αi ∈ S(w−1 ) exactly when i + 1 comes before i in the word
form of w. This is of course well-known.
2.4 Let P (n) denote the set of partitions of n. Then λ := {λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λk > 0} ∈
P (n) defines the sizes λi of the Jordan blocks of some element xλ ∈ n. Set Oλ = Gxλ . Let
λ∗ = {λ∗1 ≥ λ∗2 ≥ · · · ≥ λ∗l > 0} be the dual partition. By definition λ∗i = ♯{j | λj ≥ i}.
Then k = λ∗1 , l = λ1 and this notation will be fixed throughout. We view λ as a Young
diagram Dλ with k rows of length λ1 , . . . , λk .
                                                                 Pk
    The rank of a Jordan block of size r is just r − 1 so rk xλ = i=1 (λi − 1) = n − λ∗1 .
    For all integer i ≥ 1, the Jordan blocks of xiλ are obtained by deleting the first i
columns of λ. Then
                  Pi
 (1) rk xiλ = n − j=1 λ∗j .
                                       Pk
(2) Again (cf. [H, §3.8]) dim Oλ = n2 − i=1 (λ∗i )2 .
2.5 Define a partial order on P (n) as follows. Let λ = (λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · λk ) and
µ = (µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ · · · µk ) be partitions of n which we can assume to correspond to

                                                    5
diagrams of the same height by adding empty rows. Set λ ≤ µ if

                     i
                     X            i
                                  X
                           λj ≥         µj ,   for   all   i = 1, 2, · · · , k.
                     j=1          j=1


The following result of M. Gerstenhaber (cf. [H, §3.10]) shows that this order corre-
sponds to inclusion of nilpotent orbit closures:

Theorem. Given two partitions λ and µ of n one has λ ≤ µ if and only if Oµ ⊂ Oλ .

     In our convention λ = (n) is the minimal partition of n and λ = (1, 1, . . . , 1) is the
maximal one.
2.6 For a partition λ of n one can fill the boxes of Dλ with n distinct positive integers.
If the entries increase in rows from left to right and in columns from top to bottom,
we call such an array a Young tableau. If the numbers in Young tableau form a set of
integers from 1 to n we call it standard. Let Tn be the set of standard Young tableaux
of size n.
     We shall not distinguish between Young and standard tableaux. Indeed if a Young
tableau has entries t1 < t2 < · · · < tn then it can be identified with the standard tableau
obtained by replacing ti by i. Similarly the sequence [tw(1) , . . . , tw(n) ] : w ∈ Sn can be
viewed as a word form of w by replacing ti by i. We call this process standardization.
Occasionally it can cause confusion; but in such cases adequate warning will be given.
We may also concatenate word forms so then [a1 , a2 , . . . , an ] can be written as [a′ , a′′ ]
where a′ = [a1 , a2 , . . . , ai ], a′′ = [ai+1 , . . . , an ].
     The shape of a Young tableau T is defined to be the Young diagram from which T
was built. It defines a partition of n which we denote by sh T.
     Given T ∈ Tn , let σ(T ) denote the conjugate standard tableau obtained by rotation
about the main diagonal. We remark that sh σ(T ) = (sh T )∗ . Again σ takes a row
tableau R into a column tableau C and vise-versa.
     Given any sequence S of strictly increasing integers (for example a row R or column
C above) let Sb denote the reversed sequence of strictly decreasing integers. For any
tableau or word form S, let < S > denote the set of entries of S and |S| the cardinality
of < S > .
     The Robinson - Schensted correspondence w 7→ (Q(w), R(w)) gives a bijection (see,
for example [Kn] or [F]) from the symmetric group Sn onto the pairs of standard Young
tableaux of the same shape. By R. Steinberg [St] for all w, y ∈ Sn one has Vw = Vy

                                                6
iff Q(w) = Q(y). This parameterizes the set of orbital varieties V by Tn . Moreover
sh Q(w) = λ if and only if Vw is contained in Oλ .
      If Q(w) = T we set VT := Vw and TVw := Q(w).
      We define a partial order on Young tableaux and a partial order on orbital varieties
analogous to the order on partitions given in 2.5. It is called the geometric order on V
or on Tn .

Definition. (i) Given distinct V1 , V2 ∈ V. Set V2 > V1 if V2 ⊂ V 1 .
(ii) Given distinct T1 , T2 ∈ Tn . Set T2 > T1 if VT2 > VT1 .

    In general the problem of the combinatorial description of geometric order is ex-
tremely difficult. Partial results are described in [M5], which for the case studied below
gives a complete answer. All that is needed here in 2.17; though a more general result
is given in [M2].
2.7    Fix T ∈ Tn with sh T = λ. For all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} let Tji denote the ij-th entry
of T when it is defined.

Definition. For any tableau T
 (i) Given s = Tji , set rT (s) = i and cT (s) = j.
(ii) For all 1 ≤ i ≤ λ∗1 = k, set T i = (T1i , · · · , Tλi i ). It is the i−th row of T.
                                                           λ∗
(iii) For all j : 1 ≤ j ≤ λ1 = l, set Tj = (Tj1 , . . . , Tj j ). It is the j−th column of T.
(iv) The hook number of the ij−th entry of T is defined by

                                   h(Tji ) = 1 + (λ∗j − j) + (λi − i).


(v) Tji is called a corner entry of T if h(Tji ) = 1.
(vi) If i ≤ j, then T i,j denotes the subtableau with rows T i , T i+1 , . . . , T j . Otherwise it
     denotes the empty tableau.

      A row (resp. column) of T is determined by its entries since these must increase
from left to right (resp. from top to bottom).
    Let T = (T1 , T2 , . . . , Tl ), S = (S1 , S2 , . . . , Sl′ ) be Young tableaux given by their
columns. Assume that T, S have no common entries. Then we define (T, S) to be the
array whose rows are the same as the rows of (T1 , T2 , . . . , Tl , S1 , S2 , . . . , Sl′ ), that is
r(T,S) (Tji ) = i and r(T,S) (Sji ) = i, and ordered in the increasing order. Of course this
involves the shuffling of numbered boxes within a row.

                                                  7
Lemma. (T, S) is a Young tableau.

Proof.
   The proof is by induction on rows. Suppose that the integers in the first r rows
have been placed in increasing order and that the resulting array of r rows obtained
from (T, S) is a Young tableau. Let i1 < i2 < · · · < in be the integers of the r−th row
and j1 < j2 < · · · < jm : m ≤ n the ordered set of entries of < T r+1 , S r+1 > . Since
T, S are Young tableaux and their entries are distinct from one another, there exists an
injective map φ : {1, 2, . . . , m} → {1, 2, . . . , n} such that jt > iφ(t) . Then js > jt > iφ(t)
for all t = 1, 2, . . . , s. Thus js exceeds s elements of the r−th row. This forces js > is ,
as required.


     If the entries of S all exceed those of T then one only needs to shift numbered boxes

2.8 Take j ∈ N such that j 6∈< R > . Let ai be the smallest entry of R greater than j
and set:

     Define wr , wc ∈ W by word forms
                                      ∗
                    wr (T ) := [T λ1 , · · · , T 1 ],       wc (T ) := [T̂1 , · · · , T̂λ1 ]

Lemma. [M5 or M1, 3.2.2] One has

                                   Q(wr (T )) = Q(wc (T )) = T.

Proof.
     We give a proof for completion and to clarify the nature of Robinson-Schensted
correspondence.
    Let T be a Young tableau and b1 an integer > 0 not belonging to the entries of T.
The Robinson-Schensted (RS) insertion of b1 into T gives a new Young tableau (T ↓ b1 ).
This is an inductive procedure in which b1 , b2 , . . . , are defined and bi is inserted into the
i−th row of T . In detail, write T 1 = (a1 , a2 , . . . , al ). If b1 > al then b1 is inserted into
T 1 and the process stops, that is
                                              1               
                                                 T + b1
                                 (T ↓ b1 ) =                     .
                                                    T 2,k

                                                        8
Otherwise let i be the smallest integer such that b1 < ai . Then (T ↓ b1 )1 is obtained by
replacing ai by b1 . Set b2 = ai . Then
                                                                   
                                                    (T 1 ↓ b1 )1
                                 (T ↓ b1 ) =                            .

    Let w = [a1 , a2 , . . . , an ] be a word form. Then Q(w) is obtained inductively as
follows. Take Q0 (w) to be the empty tableau and set Qi (w) = (Qi−1 (w) ↓ ai ), ∀i : 1 ≤
i ≤ n. Then Q(w) = Qn (w).
    We prove lemma by induction on rows. Let T be a Young tableau and set T 1 =
(a1 , a2 , . . . , al ). Then ai < ai+1 , ai < Ti2 , ∀i : 1 ≤ i ≤ l (using the convention that
the undefined entries Tij : j > 2, of T are set equal to ∞). Conversely starting from
T 2,k and the sequence R = (a1 , a2 , . . . , al ) with the above properties we obtain a Young
tableau S with S 1 = R, S i = T i , ∀i > 1. One checks that Q([wr (T 2,k ), R]) = S and
this proves the first part of the lemma. The second obtains via σ.


2.9 Let us describe the jeu de taquin (cf. [Sch]) which removes Tji from T. The resulting
tableau is denoted by T − Tji and is obtained as follows.
    Consider a row R = (a1 , · · ·). Take j ∈ N such that j > a1 and j 6∈< R > . Let ai
be the greatest entry of R smaller than j and set:

                           (R ↑ j) := (a1 , · · · , ai−1 , j, ai+1 , · · ·).

One may remark that ((R ↑ j) ↓ ai ) = R.
    Take some element ai of R and set:

                            (R − ai ) := (a1 , · · · , ai−1 , ai+1 , · · ·)

Similar operations are defined for a column C except that we write (C ← j) for
σ(σ(C) ↑ j).
    With these preliminaries we write
(1) If h(Tji ) = 1, then
                                                               

Theorem. [Sch] If T is a Young tableau then so is (T − Tji ).
2.10 Given w ∈ W, T ∈ Tn , V ∈ V, a standard parabolic subgroup P and a
standard parabolic subalgebra p. Let pαi be the minimal standard parabolic subalgebra
including X−αi and let Pαi be the corresponding standard parabolic subgroup. Define
their τ -invariants to be
                             τ (w) := Π ∩ S(w−1 ),
                             τ (T ) := {αi : rT (i + 1) > rT (i)},
                             τ (P) := {αi : Pαi ⊂ P},
                             τ (p) := {αi : pαi ⊂ p},
                             τ (V) := {αi : Pαi (V) = V}.
Note that P (resp. p) is uniquely determined by its τ -invariant. Let PT = PVT be the
stabilizer of VT . It is a standard parabolic subgroup of G and we set pT = pVT = Lie PT .
By say [J, §9] one has
Lemma. τ (w) = τ (Vw ) = τ (Q(w)) = τ (PVw ) = τ (pVw ).
2.11 Given I ⊂ Π, let PI denote the unique standard parabolic subgroup of G such
that τ (PI ) = I. Let MI be the unipotent radical of PI and LI a Levi factor. Let
pI , mI , lI denote the corresponding Lie algebras. These notation will be conserved
throughout though the subscripts may sometimes be dropped.
     Given w ∈ W, let ℓ(w) denote its reduced length. Let WI be the subgroup of W
generated by the sα : α ∈ I and wI its unique longest element. It is also defined by
condition S(wI ) = R+ ∩ NI. The following is well known and easy to check.
Lemma. VI := VwI is the unique orbital variety with closure mI . Moreover if τ (V) ⊃ I,
then V ⊂ VI = mI .
Remark. Set OI = GVI . One calls VI the Richardson component (of OI ∩ n) defined
by I. With respect to the order relation defined in 2.6, VI is the unique minimal orbital

                                              10
variety with τ −invariant I. In general if n∩y n ⊂ n∩w n then trivially Vy ⊂ B(n ∩w n) =
V w . By the lemma the converse holds if w = wI , for some I ⊂ Π; but fails in general
[M5, 4.1.1].
2.12   Given I ⊂ Π. Write TVI simply as TI . It is obtained by the following rules
 (i) rTI (1) = 1.
(ii) Given s : 1 < s ≤ n

                             rTI (s) =
                                             rTI (s − 1) + 1, otherwise.

    A useful way to present TI is as follows. Partition {1, 2, . . . , n} into connected
subsets Cj := {bj , bj + 1, . . . , bj+1 − 1} by choosing a strictly increasing sequence
1 = b1 < b2 < · · · < bl+1 = n + 1. Setting I = {αi | i, i + 1 belong to some Cj } defines a
bijection between the set of all such partitions and the set of subsets of Π. Given I ⊂ Π,
let {CiI : i = 1, 2, . . . , l} be the corresponding connected subsets which we view as
columns. (Sometimes we may omit the I superscript.) Then in the notation of 2.7 we
have TI = (C1I , C2I , . . . , ClI ). Of course this involves some sliding of boxes to the left.
However there are some advantages in this presentation. For example TI − 1 is obtained
by simply replacing C1 by C1 − 1 and TI − n is obtained by simply replacing Cl by
Cl − n. Again one easily checks the

Proposition. For all I ⊂ Π, the word form of wI is given by

                                          b1I , C
                                    wI = [C     b2I , . . . , C
                                                              blI ].

     We call CiI the i−th chain of TI and TI = (C1I , C2I , . . . , ClI ) the chain form of TI .
Example
Consider I = {α1 , α4 , α5 , α6 , α9 } in sl10 . Then

                                             1   3        4   8   9

or in chain form TI = (C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , C5 ) where C1 = {1, 2}, C2 = {3}, C3 =
{4, 5, 6, 7}, C4 = {8} and C5 = {9, 10}.

2.13 Given an orbital variety V, set O = GV. It is a nilpotent orbit. Given a nilpotent
orbit O′ ⊂ O one may try to describe V ∩ O′ . In general it is not even known if this
intersection is equidimensional. However if V = VI for some I ⊂ Π a complete answer
given by [S1], [M5 or M1] and 2.11. Set OI = GVI .

Theorem. Let O be a nilpotent orbit in OI = GmI . Then mI ∩ O is the union of
orbital varieties V in O ∩ n satisfying τ (V) ⊃ I.
Proof.
    By [S1, p. 456, last corollary] mI ∩ O is equidimensional.
    By [M1, 4.1.8 or M5, 3.5.6] it contains at least one orbital variety and so dim V =
1
2 dim O, for every irreducible component V of O ∩ mI . Yet V ⊂ O ∩ n, which also has
dimension 21 dim O. Hence V is an orbital variety associated to O. Then by 2.11 every
orbital variety V associated to O lies in mI if and only if τ (V) ⊃ I.


Remark. By 2.10, αi ∈ τ (VT ) if and only if rT (i + 1) > rT (i). In particular if V > VI
then for any i one has rTV (i) ≥ rTI (i).
2.14 Take I ⊂ Π and recall the notation of 2.11. Set BI = B ∩ LI , nI = n ∩ lI
and W I = {w ∈ W | wI ⊂ R+ }. We have decompositions B = MI ⋊BI , n = nI ⊕
              ∼
mI , W I × WI → W. They define projections B → BI , n → nI and W → WI which
                                            I
we will denote by πI , or simply by π. Let Vπ(w) be the orbital variety of lI with closure
BI (nI ∩π(w) nI ).

Proposition. [M1, 4.1.2 or M5, 4.2.2] For all w ∈ W, I ⊂ Π one has πI (V w ) =
          I
π(Vw ) = Vπ(w) .

Remark 1. It is clear that πI is inclusion preserving. Thus if Vw , Vy are orbital
                                       I        I
varieties of g with V w ⊂ V y , then V π(w) ⊂ V π(y) .
Remark 2. Suppose a ⊂ n is h stable. Since root subspaces are one-dimensional we
obtain πI (a) = a ∩ nI . Again MI acts by 1 on n/mI . Then since πI is continuous

                         πI (Ba) ⊂ πI (Ba) ⊂ Ba ∩ nI ⊂ πI (Ba)
         I
and so V π(w) = V w ∩ nI .
    For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n set [i, j] = {r ∈ N |i ≤ r ≤ j}, Πi,j = {αr | r, r + 1 ∈ [i, j]}
and πi,j = πΠi,j . Define Tn → Tj−i+1 , through the jeu de taquin applied to the entries
(taken in any order) of T not lying in [i, j]. By [M1, 2.4.16, 4.1.1 or M5 4.3.3] one has

                                   πi,j (V T ) = V πi,j (T ) .                        (∗)

   2.15 Definition. Let ≥ be an order relation on V. Given VT2 > VT1 We call VT2
a descendant of VT1 (respectively T2 a descendant of T1 ) if for any orbital variety W
such that VT2 ≥ W ≥ VT1 one has W = VT2 or W = VT1 . One calls VT2 a geometric
descendant of VT1 when ≥ is the geometric order.

     If unqualified descendant will mean geometric descendant.
     The set of descendants of any TI : I ⊂ Π is described explicitly in [M2, 2.6] The
simplification that results in our case can be understood as follows.
    Define the Duflo (or weak Bruhat) order on W by y ⊇ w if n∩y n ⊂ n∩w n. Through
the map w 7→ Q(w) it induces an order relation ⊃ on Tn and hence on V called the
(induced) Duflo order. Remark 2.11 states just that Vy ⊂ V w if y ⊇ w, but the converse
can fail unless w = wI . The description of the induced Duflo order on Tn is itself a
quite non-trivial problem; but the complete solution was given in [M1, 3.3.3, 3.4.5 or
M5, 3.3.3, 3.4.4]. By the above remark the set of geometric descendants of a Richardson
component is contained in the set of Duflo descendants in turn described by [M2, 2.6].
   Present TI as in 2.12, that is we write TI = (C1I , C2I , . . . , ClI ). Set ci = |Ci |. Then
ςi = Cici is the largest entry of Ci and moreover belongs to TIci .
     For any 1 ≤ i ≤ l, suppose that there exists j : 1 ≤ j < i such that cj ≥ ci . Take
the maximal integer i′ : 1 ≤ i′ < i such that ci′ is minimal with the property that
ci′ ≥ ci . Define                                     
                                           T 1,ci −1
                                        T ci − ςi 
                                                      
                             TI (i) :=  T ci +1,ci′ 
                                        ci′ +1        
                                         T        + ςi
                                           T ci′ +2,k
In other words we move ςi from the ci −th to the (ci′ + 1)−th row according to the rules
of 2.9. In example 2.12 one has c2 = 1 > c1 = 2; c3 = 4 is maximal, c4 = c2 = 1 and
c5 = c1 = 2. Thus our procedure defines 3 tableaux:

           1   4    8    9                1   3    4   9                1    3    4   8   9

           2   5   10                     2   5    8 10                 2    5
TI (2) =                     , TI (4) =                    , TI (5) =                         .
           3   6                          6                             6   10

           7                              7                             7

Lemma. TI (i) is a Young tableau.

Proof.

                                              13
     Indeed the largest element ςi of the i−th chain is relocated on the i′ −th chain where
it becomes the largest element since i′ < i. Then the assertion follows from lemma 2.7.


2.16     As noted in 2.12 the tableau π1,n−1 (TI ) is obtained from TI by eliminating n
from Cl . It corresponds to the subset In = I ∩ Π1,n−1 with CiIn = CiI : i < l and
ClIn = ClI − n. Similarly π2,n (TI ) is obtained from TI by eliminating 1 from C1 and
corresponds to the subset I1 = I ∩ Π2,n with CiI1 = CiI : i > 1 and C1I1 = C1I − 1.

Lemma. Assume that TI (i) is defined. Then i > 1 and
 (i) π1,n−1 (TI (i)) = TIn (i), if i < l.
(ii) π2,n (TI (i)) = TI1 (i), if c1 6= ci or there exists j : 1 < j < i such that cj = ci .
(iii) π2,n (TI (i)) = TI1 , if c1 = ci and cj 6= ci , ∀j : 1 < j < i.

Proof.
    (i) is an immediate consequence of ςi < n, for i < l. The hypothesis of (ii) implies
that TI1 (i) is defined. If in the choice of i′ (as above) one can choose i′ : 1 < i′ < i,
then both TI (i) and TI1 (i) are obtained by moving ςi from ci −th row to (ci′ + 1)−th
row, an operation which commutes with replacing C1 by C1 − 1. If necessarily i′ = 1 but
c1 > ci then ςi goes from ci −th row to (c1 + 1)−th row in forming TI (i), but then goes
to c1 −th row in forming π2,n (TI (i)). However if c1 > ci this is exactly what happens
in forming TI1 (i) from TI1 . Hence (ii). Under the hypothesis of (iii), ςi is pushed back
into ci −th row in forming π2,n (TI (i)) which is hence TI1 .


2.17    Retain the conventions of 2.15.

Proposition. Take I ⊂ Π. Assume TI (i) is defined and hence i′ is defined. If ci′ = ci
then TI (i) is a descendant of TI of codimension 1 and all the descendants of codimension
1 of TI are so obtained.

Proof.
     By 2.15, T = TI (i) is a Young tableau and VT ⊂ V I .
     By 2.4 (2) we have

                               dim VT = dim VI − |ci′ − ci | + 1.                             (∗)

Take ci′ = ci , then VT is a descendant just by dimension considerations.
    Conversely assume that T > TI with VT of codimension one in mI . It remains to
show that T = TI (i), for some i.

                                                14
     By Remark 2.13 we have

                              rT (s) ≥ rTI (s),      for   all s.

On the other hand by 2.4(2) and 2.5, sh T is obtained from sh TI by lowering exactly
one box by row. Combined with the previous result this means that there is exactly one
entry, say m of TI which is displaced on passing to T and moreover it appears exactly
one row below. Suppose αm ∈ τ (TI ). Since τ (T ) ⊃ τ (TI ) by 2.11, it follows by Remark
2.13, that

      rT (m + 1) ≥ rT (m) + 1 = rTI (m) + 2,         whilst rTI (m + 1) = rTI (m) + 1.

This contradicts rT (m + 1) = rTI (m + 1). Thus, in the previous notation m = ςi , the
latter being the longest element of some chain Ci of TI of length ci . By the above we
also have T ci = TIci − m and T ci +1 = TIci +1 + m whilst the remaining rows of T, TI
must coincide. Finally we must have some i′ < i with ci′ = ci , for otherwise m would
be strictly less then an entry in T above it. We conclude that T = TI (i), as required.


2.18 By 2.17 we conclude that the orbital varieties of codimension 1 in VI are obtained
by moving ςi from row ci to row (ci +1) wherever |TIci | ≥ |TIci +1 |+2. Indeed if ςi belongs
to Tj (and here j ≤ i because some sliding of boxes from the chain form of TI may be
necessary) then the condition ci′ = ci implies that |Tj−1 | = |Tj |.
     More precisely there are exactly t + 1 := ♯{j | 1 ≤ j ≤ i with cj = ci } columns of
T , namely Tj , Tj−1 , . . . , Tj−t , having length |Tj |. In addition suppose that i is maximal
for a given value ci that is cj 6= ci for any j > i. Then there are exactly t choices of s
such that TI (s) is defined and has the same shape as TI (i).
     Observe that the partition λI = sh TI is defined by chain lengths namely we have
λI = {ci : i = 1, 2, . . . , l} appropriately ordered. Fix c ∈ λ∗I and set t+1 = ♯{i | ci = c}.
 ∗

Suppose t ≥ 1 and let OI (c) be defined through the partition λI (c) obtained from λI
by replacing the appropriate pair (c, c) in λ∗I by (c + 1, c − 1). Then we may summarize
the above by

Proposition. Fix I ⊂ Π and c ∈ N+ . Set t = ♯{i | ci = c} − 1. Assume t ≥ 1. Then
mI ∩OI (c) is a union of t orbital varieties of codimension 1 in mI . Moreover these orbital
varieties correspond to the standard tableaux TI (i) : ci = c, except for the minimal i
that is i : ci = c and cj 6= c for all j < i.

                                                15
    Note that orbital varieties of codimension 1 in the nilpotent radical of a parabolic
appear exactly when there are repetitions in the dual partition associated to this
parabolic.
2.19 Let m− be the opposed algebra of m = m+ identified with m∗ through the Killing
form. By Krull’s theorem the ideal I(V) of definition of an orbital variety closure V in
the conclusion of 2.18 is principal in S(m− ) and we denote by fI (i), or simply f, the
corresponding irreducible generator in S(m− ).
     The form of fI (i) was conjectured by Benlolo and Sanderson in [BS]. We refer to
this and their conjecture simply as BS. We prove this conjecture in Sect. 3.
    As explained in 1.4, 1.5 the general form of fI (i) is gr a for some minor a of a generic
matrix in mI + Id . They took a suitable minor lying in a bottom left-hand corner. In
this they needed results similar to [M5] to reduce to the case when I, c are chosen so
that c = c1 = cl and ci 6= c for 1 < i < l. Then their conjecture is equivalent to saying
that a is just the (n − c) × (n − c) minor lying in the bottom left-hand corner.
     The BS reduction can be read off from 2.16 and 2.18 which makes precise the
result of [M5] which one needs and we believe clarifies their analysis. A key point is
the knowledge of the orbital varieties of codimension 1 in mI given by 2.17 developed
from the results of [M5]. We remark that the codimension 1 case is relatively easy and
barely uses the full power of [M5].
    For all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, set Xi,j = Cei,j . Given w ∈ W, we give the affine
|R+ | − ℓ(w) dimensional space X(w) a matrix presentation through X(w)i,j = Xi,j ,
wherever i < j and w(i) < w(j).
    Let xj,i denote the coordinate function on g defined by
                                         
                                           −1, if (r, s) = (i, j),
                          xj,i (er,s ) =
                                           0,  otherwise.

Then the Poisson bracket {, } defined on S(g∗ ) through the Lie bracket on g satisfies

                              {xi,j , xr,s } = δj,r xi,s − δs,i xr,j                     (∗)

where δi,j is the Kronecker delta. Setting xi,j = ei,j for i > j identifies m− with m∗ .
    Given w ∈ W, let M(w) be the matrix with entries
                                 
                                   xi,j , if Xj,i ⊂ X(w),
                      M(w)i,j =
                                   0,     otherwise.

When w = wI , we set M(w) = MI .

By [BS, lemma 2] the lowest non-zero coefficient is mlI that is the coefficient of tdI .
The BS conjecture states that fI (l) = mlI .
    In our example dI = 0 and lI = 3 so that

                mlI = x3,1 x4,2 x5,3 + x3,2 x4,3 x5,1 − x3,1 x4,3 x5,2 − x3,2 x4,1 x5,3 .

    It is clear that mlI = gr MIc (1). We do not need to know the explicit power of t
which divides MIc (t), though this is used in one of our three proofs of irreducibility. The
BS conjecture can be expressed as the following theorem which we prove in the next
section.

Theorem. Take I ⊂ Π and let TI = (C1 , C2 , . . . , Cl ) be its chain form. Set ci = |Ci |,
for all i.
 (i) Assume c1 = cl =: c and cj 6= c, ∀j : 1 < j < l. Then I(V TI (l) ) is generated by
     {xij : Xij ∈ pI ∩ n− } and mlI .
(ii) Suppose there exist i < j such that ci = cj and cs 6= ci , ∀s :           i < s < j.
    Set u =    Ci1 ,
                 v =        Cjci        ′
                           and I = I ∩ Πu,v . Then I(V TI (j) ) is generated by
                            −
    {xij : Xij ∈ pI ∩ n } and mlI ′ defined with respect to VTI ′ viewed as an or-
    bital variety in πu,v (n).

    Note that the part (i) of the theorem is a special case of part (ii) and part (ii) will
be deduced from part (i).

As noted in [BS, VIII] one may check that MIc (t), and hence mlI has a weight
−γc . Moreover with respect to the Cartan inner product ( , ) one has (γc , α) = 0,
∀α ∈ Π \ {αc , αn−c }. In particular

                                   (γc , α) = 0,          ∀α ∈ I.                       (∗).



3. Proof of the Benlolo-Sanderson conjecture.
3.1 Let us recall some general facts about ideals of definition of orbital variety closures.
    Retain the notation of 2.11 and 2.18. Let P be some standard parabolic subgroup
of G, p = Lie (P) and m its nilradical. Let V be a closed subvariety of m and I (resp. J)
its ideal of definition in S(m− ) (resp. S(g)). One has J = I + S(g)p and J ∩ S(m− ) = I
from which one easily checks the

Lemma. The following are equivalent
 (i) {I, I} ⊂ I and {p, I} ⊂ J.
(ii) {I, I} ⊂ I and V is P invariant.

                                                   18
(iii) {J, J} ⊂ J.

3.2 One calls V involutive if any one of the above holds. If V is involutive then so are
its irreducible components.
      Suppose V ⊂ m is irreducible. Then GV contains a unique dense orbit O. If in
addition V is involutive then dim(V ∩ O) ≥ 12 dim O since O is a symplectic variety. Yet
dim(n ∩ O) = 12 dim O and so V ∩ O must be an irreducible component of n ∩ O hence
an orbital variety associated to O with closure V.
3.3 Let Jo be an ideal of S(g) with radical J. Suppose {Jo , Jo } ⊂ Jo . It is generally
false that this implies {J, J} ⊂ J, so one cannot conclude that the zero variety of Jo is
involutive. This is a delicate point in general. In the present situation, this difficulty
can be avoided. Call f ∈ S(m− ) multilinear if its degree in any one of the variables xi,j
is at most 1. This property passes to the irreducible factors f1 , f2 , . . . , ft and we let
V(f1 ), . . . , V(ft ) denote their sets of zeros in m. Consider the condition

                                 {p, f } ⊂ S(m− )f + S(g)p.                                (∗)

Proposition. Suppose f ∈ S(m− ) is multilinear. Then
 (i) S(m− )f is semiprime.
(ii) S(m− )f + S(g)p is semiprime.
(iii) If (∗) holds then the V(fi ) are orbital varieties of codimension 1 in m.

Proof.
     (i) is immediate. (ii) is easily deduced from (i). Finally (iii) follows from (ii) and
3.1, 3.2.


3.4   Our proof of the BS conjecture involves three steps. The first is to show that
f = mlI satisfies 3.3 (∗). This is rather obvious especially from the quantum viewpoint
of [J2, Lecture 7]. Nevertheless a delicate point is that MIc (t) itself does not satisfy (∗).
We may view its zero set as a deformation of V(f ); but which is not itself orbital nor
P invariant. (Our original motivation for such deformation came from trying to define
an Enright functor on orbital varieties itself inspired by the algorithm for Ann U(n− ) v
in [J1, 8.4] based on the Enright functor.) This result is given in 3.11.
     The second step is to show that f is irreducible. This is a delicate point. However
we can give three different proofs. The first, given in 3.15, is a fairly explicit but includes
some computations involving the precise knowledge of MIc . The second, outlined in 4.3,
uses representation theory. We construct a simple highest weight module L with integral

                                              19
highest weight which is a strong quantization of V(f ). This is of interest in its own right.
Then we use the linear independence of the characteristic polynomials of orbital varieties
and the irreducibility of the associated variety of L which holds [M4] in type A. The
third method, given in 4.7, is the least computational; but the most sophisticated. Here
we construct a strong quantization; but not necessary having integral highest weight.
Then we use the difficult fact that V (Ann L) is the closure of a nilpotent orbit. In type
A this has the relatively easy proof using mainly that orbit closures are normal [BK].
Finally we apply 2.18. In all these methods it is crucial to use that ci 6= c, ∀1 < i < l.
Otherwise V(f ) has exactly t := ♯{i | ci = c} − 1 components. A computational proof
in some special cases when mlI = MIc (0) was also given in [BS]. Even that is not trivial
though this case can be viewed as an easy consequence of 2.4 (1) combined with 2.18.
      Step three is to show that MIc vanishes on X(w) for some w : Q(w) = TI (l). Then
PI invariance implies V(f ) ⊃ B(n ∩w n). This is shown in 3.8. Since both have codi-
mension 1 in mI , irreducibility finishes the proof. Notice this does not use involutivity;
but by 3.1 the latter is equivalent to PI invariance. One may also avoid this last step
by combining 3.3. and 2.18; but this is less satisfying.
3.5    Given w ∈ Sn with word form [a1 , a2 , . . . , an ], let w − s ∈ Sn−1 be defined by
deleting s and standardizing the word form. For any matrix M let Mi,j be the matrix
obtained from M by deleting the i−th row and j−th column. Recall the definition of
X(w) given in 2.19.

Lemma. For all w ∈ W, s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} one has X(w − s) = X(w)s,s.

Proof.
      Take 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Then w(αi,j ) ∈ R+ if and only if w(i) < w(j) with a similar
assertion for y = w − s. Yet recalling that we are standardizing w − s we have up to
standardization
                                   
                                     ar ,   if r < w−1 (s),
                           y(r) =
                                     ar+1 , if r ≥ w−1 (s),

From this the assertion readily follows.


3.6    Suppose T = Q(w). It is generally false that Q(w − s) = T − s, though it is true
for the canonical elements wr (T ) and wc (T ) defined in 2.8. Here we shall only need to
describe Q(wr (T ) − s), when s ∈ T k , that is to say when s lies in the last row of T.
Recall that wr (T ) = [T k , T k−1 , . . . , T 1 ].

                                                      20

                                                         (T k − Tjk )
which gives the required assertion.


3.7       Fix I    ⊂ Π and s ∈               {1, 2, . . . , n}. Define I ′      ⊂   Π \ {αs−1 } by
I ′ = {αi | i < s − 1, αi ∈ I} ∪ {αi−1 | i ≥ s, αi ∈ I}. Write TI = (C1I , C2I , . . . , ClI ) as
in 2.12.

Lemma.
 (i) wI − s = wI ′ .
(ii) Q(wI − s) = TI ′ .
                                                                            ′   ′       ′
(iii) Suppose s ∈ CjI . Then up to standardization TI ′ = (C1I , C2I , . . . , ClI ) where
                                                
                                        ′           CiI ,    if i 6= j,
                                    CiI     =
                                                    CjI − s, if i = j.

(iv) If s lies in the last row of TI then TI ′ = (TI − s) after standardization.

Proof.
      Recall from 2.15 the notation ci := |Ci | and ςi := Cici . One has

                                                         l−1
                                                         [
                                            I =Π\              ας i
                                                         i=1

Then (i) is clear if s 6= ςi for any i. Otherwise αs 6∈ I but also αs−1 6∈ I ′ . Hence (i). (ii)
follows from (i) by 2.12. (iii) is obtained from 2.12 just by definition of chains. Finally
(iii) implies (iv) since in that case TI ′ is obtained by eliminating s and sliding the rest
to the left.


3.8 Retain the notation of 2.19 and assume c = c1 = cl . Then TI (l) is defined. Set
M = MIc (t).

Proposition. Set w = wr (TI (l)). Then MIc (t) vanishes on n∩w n, that is M (X(w)) = 0.

Proof.

                                                     21
    The proof is by induction on dI defined in 2.19. If dI = 0, then ci ≤ c, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ l
and so n occurs in the last row of TI . Moreover TI (l) has c + 1 rows with n the unique
entry in row c + 1. Consequently the word form of w starts with n. By 2.3 this forces
Xi,n 6⊂ n ∩w n, ∀i < n. Thus the entries xn,i : i = 1, 2, . . . , n − c, of the last row of M
vanish on X(w) and consequently so does M.
    Let us assume the assertion holds for dI = d and take dI = d + 1. In particular
there is some ci > c. Let k be the number of rows of T := TI . Since ci > c this is
also the number of rows of T ′ := TI (l) and so the word form of w starts with s = T1k ,
where s 6∈< C1 > . By 2.3 we conclude that Xi,s 6⊂ n ∩w n, for i < s Thus the entries
xs,i : i < s in MIc (t) vanish on X(w). This leaves t as the only non-zero entry of row
s. Consequently
                                M (X(w)) = tM (X(w)s,s)                                  (∗)
it being understood that n is reduced by 1 in defining the right hand side.
     By 3.5 one has X(w)s,s = X(w−s) whilst by 3.6 one has X(w−s) = X(wr (T ′ −s)).
Recall the definition of I ′ from 3.7. By 3.7 (iv), T − s = TI ′ . Then by 2.17 T ′ − s is
                                                               ′             ′
a descendant of TI ′ . Moreover dI ′ = dI − 1 = d and C1I = C1I , ClI = ClI up to
                                   ′        ′
standardization. In particular |C1I | = |ClI | = c. Set w′ = wr (T ′ − s), M ′ = MIc ′ (t).
By the above and the induction hypothesis M ′ (X(w′ )) = 0. Then by (∗) and the above
M (X(w)) = 0.


3.9 Retain the notation and hypotheses of 3.8. For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, let M i,j denote ij−th
cofactor of M. Set d = dI and recall that td divides M. The following is clear by row
expansion of the determinant.
Lemma. Choose i, j such that Mi,j = xc+i,j ∈ m−
                                              I
                                                . Then M i,j is divisible by td .
3.10 Take f ∈ S(m− ). In computing {xi,j , f } via 2.19 (∗) we obtain two types of
terms. The first (resp. second) is obtained from the first (resp. second factor on the
right-hand side. We call them the terms obtained from j (resp. i).
Lemma. Suppose i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n − 1} \ {c, n − c}. Then

                            {xi,i+1 , M } ⊂ S(m−
                                               I )M + S(g)pI .


Proof.
    Let X be matrix with entries Xi,j = xi,j and X the (n − c) × (n − c) minor in the
bottom left-hand corner of X + tId . Then M − X ∈ S(g)pI . Since pI is a subalgebra it
is enough to prove the corresponding assertion for X.

                                             22
    Consider {xi,i+1 , X}.
 (i) Suppose i > c. Then the sum of terms coming from (i+1) forms a determinant X i+1
    with the same rows as X except that the entries xi+1,s +δi+1,s t on the (i+1−c)−th
    row of X are replaced by xi,s . Hence this term equals −tX i+1−c,i .
(ii) Suppose i < n − c. Then the sum of terms coming from i forms a determinant Xi
    with the same columns as X except that the entries xs,i + δs,i t on the i−th column
    of X are replaced by −xs,i+1 . Hence this term equals tX i+1−c,i .
    If c < i < n − c then terms cancel. If i < c or i > n − c, both terms are zero. This
proves the lemma.


3.11   Let f = mlI .

Lemma. One has {pI , f } ⊂ S(m−
                              I
                                )f + S(g)pI .

Proof.
    By 2.20 (*) f has weight zero with respect to the Cartan sublagebra [lI , lI ] ∩ h
of the semisimple Lie algebra [lI , lI ]. Since S(g) and S(g)lI are locally finite lI
modules it follows from the theory of finite dimensional lI modules that it suf-
fices to show {xi,i+1 , f } ⊂ S(m−   I )f + S(g)pI , for all 1    ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and
                   −
{xi+1,i , f } ⊂ S(mI )f + S(g)pI , for all αi ∈ τ (pI ). By 3.10 among all {xi,i+1 , f } it
remains to consider the cases i = c, n − c. Both are similar and we consider only the
first. Consider {xc,c+1 , M }. The sum of terms coming from c + 1 all lie in S(g)p. The
sum of terms coming from c equal to tM 1,c mod S(g)p. Yet M1,c = xc+1,c ∈ m−    I
                                                                                  so by
3.9 this expression is divisible by td+1 mod S(g)pI Thus {xc,c+1 , f } = 0 mod S(g)pI .
    As for {xi+1,i , f } we show that {xi+1,i , M } = 0 exactly in the same manner as in
3.10. Let us sketch the proof. The cases i < c or i + 1 > n − c are the same so let us
show this for i + 1 > n − c. In this case the sum of terms coming from i + 1 is zero
and the sum of terms coming from i forms a determinant M i with the same rows as M
except that the (i − c)-th row is replaced by the (i − c + 1)-th row so that M i = 0. Now
if c < i < n − c − 1 then for all s 6= i, i + 1 one has Mi−c,s = 0 iff Mi+1−c,s = 0. As well
for all s 6= i − c, i + 1 − c one has Ms,i = 0 iff Ms,i+1 = 0 Using this we get exactly as in
3.10 that the sum of terms coming from i results in −tM i−c,i+1 and the sum of terms
coming from (i + 1) results in tM i−c,i+1 so that the terms cancel.


3.12     We may summarize the consequence of 3.3 (ii), 3.8, 3.11 as follows. Adopt the
notation and hypotheses of 2.19 (i). In particular set T ′ = TI (l).

                                             23
Proposition. The zero variety V(mlI ) of mlI in m−
                                                 I is a union of orbital variety
closures of codimension 1 one of which is VT ′ .

Remark. We have not yet used that cj 6= c for 1 < j < l. This is needed for irreducibil-
ity of V(mlI ). This would follow from 2.18 and the irreducibility of GV(mlI ); but we
only have a direct proof of the latter using representation theory (cf. 4.7).
3.13 Let us show that (ii) of Theorem 2.19 results from (i). This obtains from the
following general remark. Take I ⊂ Π and TI = (C1 , . . . , Cl ) be its chain form. Fix
i, j : 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ l and set TI ′ = (Ci , . . . , Cj ). Let T ′ ∈ T|TI ′ | satisfy T ′ > TI ′ and set
T = (C1 , . . . , Ci−1 , T ′ , Cj+1 , . . . , Cl ). Then T > TI and π(TI ) = TI ′ , π(T ) = T ′ , where
π = πςi−1 +1,ςj . Again by 2.14 (∗) π(VT ) = VT ′ and by 2.4 (2) the codimension of VT in
mI equals the codimension of VT ′ in mI ′ = π(mI ). The implication (i) =⇒ (ii) in 2.19
follows from the

Lemma. With the above hypotheses

                                           I(V T ) = S(m−
                                                        I

Proof.
     From the commuting diagram

                                                          π∗
                                           S(π(m−I
                                                   )) ֒→       S(m−I
                                                                     )
                                               ↓                 ↓
                                                          π∗
                                            R[V T ′ ]     ֒→   R[V T ]

we obtain the inclusion ⊃ . On the other hand

                                      − ∼
                           S(m−                  −
                              I )/IS(mI ) = S(π(mI ))/I ⊗ S(ker π),



so IS(m−
       I
         ) is prime. Equality of codimensions finishes the proof.


3.14 Let V be a vector space of dimension n < ∞. Let {vi }ni=1 be a basis of V and set
v0 = vn+1 = 0. Define e, f ∈ End V, by evi = vi−1 , f vi = vi+1 , ∀i. Let r, s be integers
> 0 and set Anr,s (t) = Det (tes + f r ).

Lemma. For all r, s, n > 0 one has
                                    
                    Anr,s (t)   =       ((−1)r+s tr )h    if h(r + s) = n,
                                        0                 if r + s does not divide n.

                                                         24
Proof.
   If r + s > n, then there are only zeros in the n − s + 1-th row, so we can suppose
r + s ≤ n. Then the first r rows have exactly one entry, namely t. Similarly the first s
columns have exactly one entry, namely 1. Developing these rows and columns gives

                                 Anr,s (t) = (−1)r+s tr An−r−s
                                                         r,s   (t),

and hence the required result.

3.15    The irreducibility of mlI is established by induction on n. In view of 3.13 it is
therefore enough to consider only the situation described in 2.19 (i). Precisely we show
the

Proposition. Take I ∈ Π and TI = (C1 , C2 , . . . , Cl ) the chain form of TI . Set ci = |Ci |.
Assume c1 = cl =: c and cj 6= c, ∀j : 1 < j < l. Then mlI is irreducible.

Proof.
     Otherwise by 2.17, 3.12 and 3.13, there is a subset I ′ of Π obtained from I ex-
actly as in 2.19 (ii) such that the corresponding f ′ := mlI ′ is an irreducible factor of
f = mlI . We obtain a contradiction by showing there exists a point x ∈ m such that
f (x) = (−1)c , f ′ (x) = 0.
     Set a = |TIc+1,k | and

              < TI1,c >= {p1 , p2 , . . . , pn−a },    < TIc+1,k >= {q1 , q2 , . . . , qa },

written in increasing order. Define x ∈ m by
                       
                         1, if r = pi , for i : c < i ≤ n − a and s = pi−c
                xr,s =
                         0, otherwise.
Set M := MIc (t). Let b be an integer 0 < b ≤ n − c and let ∆b denote the set of subsets
of {c + 1, . . . , n} of cardinality b. Given σ = {r1 , r2 , . . . , rb } ∈ ∆b , let M σ be obtained
from M by deleting the (ri − c)−th rows and ri −th columns where i = 1, 2, . . . , b. Let
Moσ be the evaluation of M σ at t = 0. Developing M gives the term (−1)c tb M σ and
moreover
                                              X
                             mn−c−b = (−1)c       Moσ .                               (∗)
                                                         σ∈∆b

     Recall that lI = n − c − a. For σ ∈ ∆a one has
                                   
                            σ        1, if σ = {q1 , q2 , . . . , qa },
                         Mo (x) =
                                     0, otherwise.

                                                  25
     Consequently
 (i) f (x) = (−1)c .
                                                                                         ′
       In the notation of theorem 2.19 (ii) set c′ := ci = cj and M ′ = MIc ′ (t). Then
(ii) f ′ (x) = 0, if c′ > c.
     Indeed in this case the last row of M ′ is indexed by the largest integer in Cj . By
the hypothesis this is an entry of TIc+1,k . Hence even M ′ (x) = 0.

     Define u, v as in theorem 2.19 (ii) and set n′ = v − u + 1. Set
σ ′ =< TIc+1,k > ∩{u, u + 1, . . . , v} and d′ = |σ ′ |. In the notation of 3.14 we have
                       ′   ′   ′
(iii) M ′ (x) = (−1)c td Anc−c′ ,c′ (t), if c′ < c.
      This is obtained through a development of M ′ similar to that for M and noting that
                                                         ′   ′     ′                 ′       ′   ′
Mo′σ (x) = 0 unless σ ⊃ σ ′ , so that M ′ (x) = (−1)c td M ′σ (x) = (−1)c td Anc−c′ ,c′ (t).

     Let us show finally that
(iv) f ′ (x) = 0, if c′ < c.
       By 3.14 it suffices to show that h(c − c′ ) + d′ > dI ′ when n′ = hc.
       Let Cm1 , Cm2 , . . . , Cmr be the chains of length > c′ between Ci and Cj . One has
         Pr
dI ′   =    (cms − c′ ) ≤ d′ + r(c − c′ ) and so the assertion holds if r < h. On the other
         s=1
hand hc = n′ ≥ (r + 2)c′ + dI ′ . Thus

                       h(c − c′ ) + d′ ≥ (r + 2)c′ + dI ′ > dI ′       if   r ≥ h.

This proves (iv).
    Finally the hypothesis itself excludes c = c′ and so the proposition follows from (i),
(ii) and (iv).

Remark. The proof of theorem 2.19 is now complete.
3.16 Adopt the hypotheses of 2.19 (i). Let r be the number of chains Ci of length > c
and s + 2c the sum of the lengths of the remaining chains.
Proposition. The generator fI (l) of I(V TI (l) ) in S(m− ) is the highest common divisor
of the (non-vanishing) (s + c) × (s + c) minors of Mr+1
                                                    I .

Proof.
    Under the hypotheses of 2.19 (i), it follows from 2.18 (in notation of 2.18) that
mI ∩ OI (c) = VTI (l) . By 2.4 (i) the nilpotent orbit to which an element x belongs is
determined by {rk xi : i = 1, 2, . . . , n}.

                                                 26
                                       P
    Set λ = sh TI . Since n −              j>r+1   λ∗j = s + c, it follows that rk xr+1 = s + c, for all
x ∈ m ∩ OI .
    Now sh TI (l) is obtained from λ by lowering a box from c−th to the (c + 1)−th
row. Under the hypotheses of 2.19 (i) this takes it from the (r + 2)−th to the (r + 1)−th
column.
    From the three paragraphs above we conclude that

                           mI ∩ OI (c) = {x ∈ m | rk xr+1 = s + c − 1}

Thus this hypersurface in mI is the set of common zeros of the (s + c) × (s + c) minors
of Mr+1
    I . Hence fI (l) is exactly their largest common divisor.


3.17 It is of course not too easy to explicitly determine fI (l) through 3.16. Moreover
these power rank conditions (i.e. 2.4 (i)) are in general insufficient to obtain ideals of
definition of orbital variety closures. This was already observed by van Leeuwen [vanL,
§8] and also resulted independently from [M5, §4.3] because otherwise the chain order
defined in [M5, 4.3.1] would coincide with the geometric order which fails in sl7 as it is
shown in [M5, 4.3.6].
   Combining 3.16 and 2.19 (i) (which implies that fI (l) = mlI ) gives a remarkable
combinatorial fact, namely 3.16, about generic matrices. Here we note that deg mlI =
(r + 1)c + s whilst the minors in the conclusion of 3.16 have degree (r + 1)(s + c). Thus
these degrees coincide if and only if rs = 0. Of course when degrees coincide fI (l) is
proportional to any non-zero (s + c) × (s + c) minor of Mr+1 I . Using this Benlolo and
Sanderson were able to prove their conjecture, that is Theorem 2.19 (i), under hypothesis
r = 0 or the hypothesis c = 1 (which forces s = 0). These cases are relatively easy up to
proving irreducibility for which they developed a special trick. A purely combinatorial
proof of the case s = 0 already appears to be rather difficult.

4. Strong quantization of hypersurface orbital varieties
4.1   We begin with a combinatorial lemma. Let ℜ be the real field.

Lemma. Let c, c2 , . . . , cl be positive integers with c = cl . Suppose that the system of
inequalities for {bi }li=2 defined by
         Ps       s−1
                  P
  1) 1 +     bi ≤       ci + max(c, cs ) : s = 2, . . . , l − 1.
          i=2       i=2
            l
            P             l−1
                          P
 2) 1 +           bi ≤           ci + max(c, cs ) : s = 2, 3, . . . , l − 1.
          i=s+1          i=s+1


                                                       27
            l
            P            l
                         P
 3) 1 +           bi =         ci
            i=2          i=2
has a solution bi ∈ ℜ, ∀i. Then cs 6= c, ∀s : 2 ≤ s < l. Moreover, if the latter holds one
can find a solution with bi ∈ N, ∀i.
Proof.
   Assume that the system has a solution bi ∈ ℜ, ∀i. Adding 1) and 2) gives
                                         l
                                         X            l
                                                      X
                                    2+         bi ≤         ci + 2 max(c, cs ) − c − cs
                                         i=2          i=2

Then in view of 3) we obtain 1 ≤ 2 max(c, cs ) − c − cs , that is c 6= cs for any s : s < k.
     Conversely equality in 1) and 3) gives
                      
                        max(c, c2 ) − 1,                    if i = 2
                 bi =                                                                                          (∗)
                        ci−1 + max(c, ci ) − max(c, ci−1 ), if 2 < i ≤ l
These imply that
        l
        X           l
                    X                                  l−1
                                                       X
             bi =         ci − max(c, cs ) =                  ci + max(c, cs ) + ((c + cs ) − 2 max(c, cs ))
     i=s+1          i=s                               i=s+1

Then 2) holds if and only if c + cs ≤ 2 max(c, cs ) − 1 for all s = 2, . . . , l − 1. Obviously
this is equivalent to cs 6= c for any s = 2, . . . , l − 1. Note that by (∗) these inequalities
provide a solution with bi ∈ N for all i.


4.2 Recall the notation of 2.7. Given I ⊂ Π let TI = (C1 , . . . , Cl ) be the corresponding
tableau. Assume that c1 = cl = c. One has Π′ := Π \ I = {αςi : i = 1, 2, . . . , l − 1}.
For i = 1, 2, . . . , c we set
                                                              n−1−i

Set β = β1 . Recall that the BS element mlI defined in 2.18 has weight wt (mlI ) =
  Pc

     Call ν ∈ h∗ , I−regular if (α, ν + ρ) 6= 0, ∀α ∈ RI . Set w.ν := w(ν + ρ) − ρ. Set

Take ci 6= c i = 2, 3, . . . , l − 1 in 4.1 and recall our normalization, making (α, α) =

for i = 1, 2, . . . , l − 1 and where {bi }li=2 are given by the conclusion of 4.1.

                                                               28
Proposition. Sµo = {(c, β)}.

Proof.
   One has

X                  l
                   X            l
                                X                    l
                                                     X                  X
      (µ + ρ, α) =   (ci − 1) =   (ci − 1) + c − 1 =   (bi − 1) + c = −   (µ + ρ, α) + c
α∈I                      i=1                i=2                       i=2                        α∈Π′

by 4.1 (3) and so
                                                         X                    X
                 (µ + ρ, β ∨ ) = (µ + ρ, β) =                  (µ + ρ, α) +          (µ + ρ, α) = c.
                                                         α∈I                  α∈Π′

Thus (c, β) ∈ Sµ .
      Observe that if (c′ , γ) ∈ Sµ : γ ∈ R+ \ RI+ , c′ ∈ N, then (c′ , γ) ∈ Sµo means that

                               sγ (µ + ρ) = µ + ρ − (γ ∨ , µ + ρ)γ = µ + ρ − c′ γ

does not vanish on any δ ∈ RI+ . Note that for δ ∈ RI+ and γ ∈ R+ \ RI+ one has
                                      
                                        0 if γ − δ 6∈ R+
                             (δ, γ) =
                                        1 if γ − δ ∈ R+

Thus vanishing on some δ ∈ RI+ means that γ − δ is a root and (δ, µ + ρ) = c′ or simply
that γ − δ is a root such that (µ + ρ, γ − δ) = (µ + ρ, γ) − (µ + ρ, δ) = 0.
    Note that β − δ is a root for δ ∈ RI+ iff δ = α1 + · · · + αi or δ = αn−1 + · · · + αn−i
where i < c. Thus (µ + ρ, β − δ) > 0 and so (c, β) ∈ Sµo .
     Consider γ = αi + αi+1 + · · · + αj for i < c and j > n − c. One has (µ + ρ, γ) =
c − (i − 1) − (n − j − 1) =: c′ . Then unless γ = β one can find δ ∈ RI+ starting at αi or
ending in αj such that (µ + ρ, γ − δ) = 0. We conclude that (c′ , γ) 6∈ Sµo .
    Set δi− = α1 + α2 + · · · + αςi−1 for 2 ≤ i ≤ l and δj+ = αςj + αςj +1 + · · · + αn−1 for
1 ≤ j ≤ l − 1. One has

Now consider γs,l = β −δs− with 2 ≤ s ≤ l −1 Then (µ+ρ, γs,l) ≤ max(c, cs ) −1. Thus it
follows that (c′ , γs,l ) 6∈ Sµo . Indeed if cs > c we can subtract δ = αςs−1 +1 +· · ·+αi for some
i : ςs−1 + 1 ≤ i < ςs from γs,l so that (µ + ρ, γs,l − δ) = 0 and if cs < c we can subtract
δ = αn−1 + · · · αi for some i : ςl−1 < i ≤ n − 1 from γs,l so that (µ + ρ, γs,l − δ) = 0. A
similar assertion holds if replace γs,l by γ = γs,l − (αςs−1 +1 + · · · + αi ) − (αn−1 + · · · αj )
for any i : ςs−1 + 1 ≤ i < ςs and j : ςl−1 < j ≤ n − 1, that is to say when some of
these roots have already been subtracted.
     A similar conclusion holds for γ1,s = β − δs+ with 2 ≤ s ≤ l − 1 and for γ =
γ1,s − (α1 + · · · + αi ) − (αςs −1 + · · · αj ) for any i : 1 ≤ i < c and j : ςs−1 < j ≤ ςs − 1
(by the obvious symmetry).
     Finally consider γi,j = β − δi− − δj+ , with 2 ≤ i < j ≤ l − 1. We have

                       (µ + ρ, γi,j ) ≤ max(c, ci ) + max(c, cj ) − c − 2.

Then a similar conclusion holds in this case also with slightly stronger reason.


Remark. One may also check that the inequalities 1) and 2) of 4.1 are necessary for
the conclusion of the proposition to hold with µ+ρ satisfying (µ+ρ, α) = 1, ∀α ∈ I and
(µ + ρ, β) = c. Consequently the proposition fails when c = ci , for some i : 1 < i < l.
                                                                                   Pc
4.3 Take µ as in 4.2 and recall the definition of βi from 2.20. Recall that γc =      βi .
                                                                                            i=1
Then (γc , α) = 0, ∀α ∈ I. Moreover µ + ρ − γc is the unique I dominant element of
WI (µ + ρ − cβ) = WI (sβ (µ + ρ)).
    Let {MIi (µ)}∞                                                        o
                 i=0 be the Jantzen filtration of MI (µ). Given (m, γ) ∈ Sµ , let ω(sγ .µ)
be the unique Π′ dominant element in WI .(sγ .µ) and sign (sγ .λ) := (−1)l(w) where
w ∈ WI is the unique element satisfying w.sγ .µ = ω(sγ .µ). The Jantzen sum formula
combined with 4.2 gives

          X                      X
                ch MIi (µ) =              sign (sγ .µ)ch MI (ω(sγ .µ)) = ch MI (µ − γc ),         (∗)

                               (m,γ)∈Sµ


by the above noting that sign (sβ .µ) is necessarily positive because there is only this
term on the right hand side. One may recall that the right hand side of the Jantzen sum
formula obtains from the zero of the Shapovalov determinants. Then the appearance of
just one term on the right hand side means that the Shapovalov determinant is non-zero
on MI (µ)ν : ν > ω(sβ .µ) and vanishes on MI (µ)ω(sβ .µ) .

    (Equivalently, but more directly by Jantzen [Ja, Satz 2] the Shapovalov determinant

This has a zero if and only if some (m, γ) ∈ Sµ and the sum of the corresponding
exponents is strictly positive. Now by (∗), χ′ν (λ) 6= 0 for some ν if and only if λ + ρ
is I regular, so we further require (µ, γ) ∈ Sµo . Moreover in this case χ′ν (λ) equals
sign (λ) dim MI (ω(λ))ν . Since in addition Sµo = {(m, β)} in the present case we must
have χ′ν (sβ .µ) ≥ 0 for all ν and of course no cancellations occur. Moreover from (∗) we
obtain                                     

which gives the required assertion.)
    This forces there to be a highest weight vector in MI (µ) of weight ω(sβ .µ) = µ−γc .
Since (α, µ) = 0 for all α ∈ I it follows that MI (µ) is a rank 1 free U (m−
                                                                           I ) module. Again

(α, µ − γc ) = 0, for all α ∈ I. Consequently this highest weight vector must generate
a submodule of MI (µ) isomorphic to MI (µ − γc ) necessarily contained in the maximal
submodule MI1 (µ) of MI (µ). By (∗) we then conclude that MI1 (µ) = MI (µ − γc ) and
so V (µ) = MI (µ)/MI (µ − γc ) is simple.
     By [M4] the associated variety of V (µ) is irreducible and hence an orbital variety
V.

     Set pI =          α. Since

it follows that the characteristic polynomial of V is just γc pI .
     Let fI (l) be the BS element constructed in 2.18 and VTI (l) the corresponding hyper-
surface orbital variety. By 3.12 the zero variety V(fI (l)) of fI (l) in m−
                                                                          I
                                                                            is a union of or-
bital variety closures of codimension 1, one of which is VTI (l) . Yet wt fI (l) = −γc and so
the characteristic polynomial of V(fI (l)) is also γc pI . By the linear independence of char-
acteristic polynomials of orbital varieties [J1] we conclude that V = V(fI (l)) = VTI (l) .

                                                  31
This proves that fI (l) is irreducible. Finally R[V TI (l) ] = S(m−         −
                                                                     I )/S(mI )fI (l), so

ch R[V TI (l) ] = ch S(m−
                        I
                          )(1 − e−γc ). Comparison with ch V (µ) which is above expres-
sion up to a shift, shows that V (µ) is a strong quantization of VTI (l) . We have proved
the

Theorem. Every hypersurface orbital variety in sln admits a strong quantization be-
ing a simple highest weight module with integral highest weight given by the above
procedure.

4.4    Let us consider the case where we take equality in 1) of 4.1. Using 3) we obtain
             s
             X            s−1
                          X                                      l
                                                                 X            l
                                                                              X
                   bi =         ci + max(c, cs ) − 1,                  bi =         ci − max(c, cs )
             i=2          i=2                                  i=s+1          i=s

Then in the notation of 4.2 for 2 ≤ s ≤ l − 1 we obtain equalities
                                    s−1
                                    X                  s
                                                       X
             (µ +   ρ, δs− )    =         (ci − 1) +         −(bi − 1) = c − max(c, cs ) + 1
                                    i=1                i=2
                                    l
                                    X                    l
                                                         X
             (µ + ρ, δs+ ) =                (ci − 1) +           −(bi − 1) = max(c, cs ) − cs
                                    i=s+1                i=s+1

Consequently (µ + ρ, γs,l) = max(c, cs ) − 1 for 2 ≤ s ≤ l − 1 and (µ + ρ, γ1,s) =
c + cs − max(c, cs ) for 2 ≤ s < l. Finally for any γs,t with 1 < s < t < l one has

  (µ + ρ, γs,t) =(µ + ρ, γ1,t) − (µ + ρ, δs− ) = c + ct − max(c, ct ) − (c − max(c, cs ) + 1)
               =(ct − 1) − max(c, ct ) + max(c, cs ).                                                   (∗)

              −
     Now let γi,j denote γi,j with the (ci − 1) roots of the i-th column and (cj − 1) of
the j-th column removed that is

                                            −
                                           γi,j = αςi+1 + · · · + αςj−1 .

Then

                  −
         (µ + ρ, γ1,t ) = c + ct − max(c, ct ) − (c − 1) − (ct − 1) = 2 − max(c, ct ).

        −
Yet to γ1,t we can always add either the roots from the first column or from t-th column
                         −
to obtain some γ := δ + γ1,t : δ ∈ RI+ . Such γ for which (µ + ρ, γ) is maximum satisfies

                    (µ + ρ, γ) = 2 − max(c, ct ) + max(c, ct ) − 1 = 1 > 0.                            (∗∗)

                                                         32
Similarly for 2 ≤ s < t ≤ l by (∗) one has

                              −
                     (µ + ρ, γs,t ) = max(c, cs ) − max(c, ct ) − (cs − 1).

     −
To γs,t we can add either the roots from the s-th column or from t-th column. Again
in the best case for such γ one has

                (µ + ρ, γ) = max(cs , ct ) + max(c, cs ) − max(c, ct ) − cs ≥ 0.   (∗ ∗ ∗)

Let us define
                   Šµ = {(m, β) ∈ −N+ × R+ \ RI+ | (β ∨ , µ + ρ) = m}

and
                       Šµo = {(m, β) ∈ Šµ | sβ (µ + ρ) is I regular }.

Lemma. With the above choice of µ one has Šµo = ∅.

Proof.
      As before given γ ∈ Šµ we must find δ ∈ RI+ such that 0 = (δ, sγ (µ + ρ)) =
(δ, µ + ρ + (µ + ρ, γ)γ). It is enough to show that γ + δ is a root vanishing on µ + ρ.
For this notice for γ ∈ Šµ we must first have r := (γ, µ + ρ) ∈ −N+ . If for example
      −
γ = γs,t  : 1 ≤ s < t ≤ l, then (∗∗), (∗ ∗ ∗) show that there exists δ ∈ RI+ such that
γ + δ is a root and (γ + δ, µ + ρ) takes all possible integer values from r to an integer
≥ 0. The general case is similar (and easier).


4.5 Let OI be the subcategory of O in which the Levi factor defined by I acts finitely.
By [JLT, 9.6]

Proposition. Given Šµo = ∅, then MI (µ) is projective in OI .

4.6   Theorem. Define µ as in 4.4. Then Ann V (µ) ∈ Max U (g).

Proof.
   Since g is of type A the natural map U (g) → F (MI (µ), MI (µ)) is surjective. Set
F µ = F (MI (µ), MI (µ)) = U (g)/Ann MI (µ). Let P be a maximal ideal of F µ . By [JLT,
10.9], 4.4 and 4.5 we have

                               P = Ann F µ (MI (µ)/P MI (µ)).

Hence P MI (µ) ( MI (µ). Yet MI (µ − γc ) is the maximal submodule of MI (µ) as a
U (g) module. This forces P ⊂ Ann V (µ) and hence equality.

                                              33
4.7      Take c = c1 , c2 , . . . , cl = c. Proceeding as in 4.2 one may rather easily show that
there exists µ ∈ h∗ satisfying (µ + ρ, α) = 1, for all α ∈ I and such that Sµo = {(c, β)}.
Then as in 4.3, one checks that V (µ) is a strong quantization of V(fI (l)). Here we do
not need ci 6= c, for i : 1 < i < l, however the resulting µ will not be integrable,
nor will the associated variety of V (µ) be irreducible. However it will be contained in
the associated variety of Ann V (µ) which by Borho-Kraft [BK] is just the closure of a
nilpotent orbit specifically OTI (l) := GVTI (l) in this case. Consequently the associated
variety of V (µ) is contained in m ∩ OTI (l) and we recall that the latter is irreducible
if and only if ci 6= c, for all i : 1 < i < l. This concludes the third proof of the
irreducibility of the BS elements.
