                                                     Abstract. This paper provides results on the modular representation theory of
                                                     the supergroup GL(m|n). Working over a field of arbitrary characteristic, we prove
                                                     that the explicit combinatorics of certain crystal graphs describe the representa-
                                                     tion theory of a modular analogue of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category O.
                                                     In particular, we obtain a linkage principle and describe the effect of certain trans-
                                                     lation functors on irreducible supermodules. Furthermore, our approach accounts
                                                     for the fact that GL(m|n) has non-conjugate Borel subgroups and we show how
                                                     Serganova’s odd reflections give rise to canonical crystal isomorphisms.

                                                In 1995 Serganova computed the characters of the finite dimensional irreducible
                                             representations of the Lie superalgebra gl(m|n, C) [17, 18]. Recently, Brundan gave a
                                             more direct way to calculate these characters [1]. He also provides for the first time
                                             a conjectural formula for the characters of the irreducible representations belonging
                                             to the gl(m|n, C)-analogue of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category O. Brundan’s
                                             approach relates the Grothendieck group of this category O to a certain gl(∞, C)-
                                                                                                                                  ∨
                                             module. To be more precise, let V denote the natural gl(∞, C)-module and let V
                                             denote its dual. Brundan identifies the complexified Grothendieck group of category
                                             O with the gl(∞, C)-module
                                                                                ∨             ∨
                                                                              V ⊗ ···⊗ V ⊗V ⊗ ···⊗ V                                          (1.1)
                                                                              |   {z    } |   {z   }
                                                                                    n times           m times
                                             so that the Verma supermodules in category O correspond to the natural monomial
                                             basis of (1.1). Then Brundan’s conjecture is that the irreducible supermodules in
                                             category O correspond to Lusztig’s dual canonical basis for (a certain completion of)
                                             the module (1.1). The subcategory F of O consisting of finite dimensional modules fits
                                             nicely into this V        the Grothendieck group of the category F is identified with
                                                              picture: V
                                                                n ∨      m
                                             the submodule        V ⊗      V of (1.1).
                                                This article is concerned instead with the crystal structures (in the sense of Kashi-
                                             wara) which underlie Brundan’s conjecture. Actually, we work throughout the article
                                             over an arbitrary field k of characteristic p, considering a modular analogue Op of the
                                             usual category O. Remarkably, all the results at the level of crystals remain true even
                                             if p > 0 provided one replaces the Lie algebra gl(∞, C) with the affine Kac-Moody

different form. At the level of Grothendieck groups, these functors correspond to the
usual Chevalley generators of gl(∞, C) acting on the module (1.1). When p > 0 one
can define analogous functors Er , Fr (r ∈ Z/pZ) on category Op . Let L(λ) be an
irreducible module in category O or Op . In both cases we prove that the modules
Er L(λ) and Fr L(λ) are either zero or else are self-dual indecomposable modules with
irreducible socle and cosocle isomorphic to L(ẽ∗r (λ)) and L(f˜r∗ (λ)) respectively. This
gives a representation theoretic definition of operators ẽ∗r , f˜r∗ on the set of weights that
parametrizes the irreducible supermodules. Our main result (Theorem 2.4) gives an
explicit combinatorial description of these operators, allowing us to verify that they
are dual to the crystal operators ẽr , f˜r associated to Kashiwara’s crystal basis of the
module (1.1).
    Let us remark that our main result contains as a special case branching rules for
representations of the supergroup GL(m|n) in characteristic p. They are a natural
extension of Kleshchev’s modular branching rules in the case of GL(n); see e.g. [3].
Our proof is an adaptation of Kleshchev’s original methods, based on some explicit
computations with certain lowering operators in the universal enveloping algebra.
    An important feature of the Lie superalgebra gl(m|n, C) is that it has various differ-
ent conjugacy classes of Borel subalgebra. These may be parametrized by a sequence
(v 1 , . . . , v m+n ) of parities v i ∈ Z2 , m of which are equal to 0̄ and n of which are equal to
1̄. Brundan only considers the Borel subalgebra corresponding to the parity sequence
(1̄, · · · , 1̄, 0̄, · · · , 0̄); in the present article we consider all the conjugacy classes of Borel
subalgebras. It turns out that in the general case one must replace the module (1.1)
with the module
                                                 V v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ V vm+n                            (1.2)
                                              ∨
where V 0̄ denotes V and V 1̄ denotes V . (It appears that Brundan’s conjecture itself
also extends nicely to other Borel subalgebras, again replacing (1.1) with (1.2).) Odd
reflections, introduced by Serganova [19] and, independently, by Dobrev and Petkova
[6], give a simple way to translate between the parametrization of irreducible highest
weight modules arising from different choices of Borel subalgebra. In the final section
of the paper we explain how these odd reflections can also be interpreted as canonical
crystal isomorphisms between the crystals associated to the modules (1.2) for different
choices of parity sequences.

                           2. Preliminaries and Main Results
2.1. Supergroups. Fix a ground field k of characteristic p (possibly p = 0). All
objects discussed in this article (superspaces, superalgebras, supergroups, etc.) will
be defined over k. Recall that a superspace is a Z2 -graded vector space and, given a
superspace V and a homogeneous vector v ∈ V, we write v ∈ Z2 for the parity (i.e.
degree) of v. We also recall that a commutative superalgebra A is a Z2 -graded asso-
ciative algebra satisfying ab = (−1)ab ba for all homogeneous a, b ∈ A. We additionally
assume that a2 = 0 for all a ∈ A1̄ when p = 2.
   Fix nonnegative integers m and n. Let V be a superspace of even dimension m
and odd dimension n; that is, V is a Z2 -graded vector space with dimk V0̄ = m and
dimk V1̄ = n. The object of study in this article is the supergroup G = GL(V ). We
define it using the language of group schemes (see [8]) as a functor from the category of
         CRYSTAL STRUCTURES ARISING FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF GL(m|n)                      3


commutative superalgebras to the category of groups: for a commutative superalgebra
A let G(A) be the group of all invertible even (i.e. grading preserving) automorphisms
of the A-supermodule V ⊗ A.
   Once and for all we fix a ordered homogeneous basis v1 , . . . , vm+n for V. Having made
this choice, we can now introduce coordinates: given a commutative superalgebra A,
we identify G(A) with the group of all invertible (m + n) × (m + n) matrices
                                     (gi,j )1≤i,j≤m+n                                (2.1)
with gi,j ∈ Avi +vj for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n. Namely, if we identify elements of V ⊗ A
with column vectors via                              
                               m+n                a1
                               X                     
                                     vi ⊗ ai ←→  ...  ,
                               i=1               am+n
then we can view such a matrix as an even endomorphism in the usual way by left
multiplication. Let f : A → B be a superalgebra homomorphism. Under our identifi-
cation, G(f ) : G(A) → G(B) corresponds to the morphism given by applying f to the
matrix entries.
   Let T be the subgroup of G consisting of diagonal matrices. More precisely, given a
commutative superalgebra A, T is the functor given by setting T (A) to be the subgroup
of G(A) consisting of all diagonal matrices. Let X(T ) be the free abelian group
                                               m+n
                                               M
                                    X(T ) =          Zεi .
                                               i=1
We identify X(T ) with the character group of T by identifying εi with the function
which picks out the ith diagonal entry of a diagonal matrix. We put a symmetric
bilinear form on X(T ) by declaring that
                                  (εi , εj ) = (−1)vi δi,j .                         (2.2)
Observe that we have an action by the symmetric group Sm+n on X(T ) given by
x · εi = εxi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n and x ∈ Sm+n .
    Given 1 ≤ t ≤ m + n, let Vt denote the subspace of V generated by v1 , . . . , vt . We
fix a choice of Borel subgroup B of G so that, for a commutative superalgebra A, B(A)
is the stabilizer of the full flag
                        0 ⊆ V1 ⊗ A ⊆ · · · ⊆ Vm+n ⊗ A = V ⊗ A.
Note that B(A) equals the set of all upper triangular invertible matrices of the form
(2.1).
   The root system of G is the set Φ = {εi − εj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n, i 6= j}. There are
even and odd roots, the parity of the root εi − εj being v i + v j . Our choice of Borel
subgroup defines a set,
                          Φ+ = {εi − εj : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m + n},                        (2.3)
of positive roots. The corresponding dominance order on X(T ) is denoted ≤ and is
defined by λ ≤ µ if µ − λ ∈ Z≥0 Φ+ .

2.2. The Superalgebra of Distributions. There is an abstract notion of the super-
algebra of distributions for a supergroup; see, for example, [4, §3]. In this case however
we can realize the superalgebra of distributions for G, Dist(G), explicitly as the reduc-
tion modulo p from an analogue of Kostant’s Z-form for the Lie superalgebra over C
corresponding to G. This Lie superalgebra consists of the set of (m + n) × (m + n) ma-
trices over C with homogeneous basis given by the matrix units ei,j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n)
and with the parity of ei,j equal to v i + v j . The superbracket of this Lie superalgebra
is given by
                     [ei,j , ek,l ] = δj,k ei,l − (−1)(vi +vj )(vk +v l ) δi,l ek,j .   (2.4)
Let UC denote the universal enveloping superalgebra of this Lie superalgebra. By the
PBW theorem for Lie superalgebras [10], UC has basis consisting of all monomials
                               Y      a
                                             Y       d
                                     ei,ji,j        ei,ji,j
                                  1≤i,j≤m+n          1≤i,j≤m+n
                                   v i +v j =0̄       v i +v j =1̄

where ai,j ∈ Z≥0 , di,j ∈ {0, 1}, and the product is taken in any fixed order. We shall
write hi = ei,i for short.
     Define the Kostant Z-form UZ to be the Z-subalgebra of UC generated by ele-
                                                   (r)
ments ei,j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n, v i + v j = 1̄), ei,j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n, i 6= j, v i + v j =

0̄, r ≥ 1), and hri (1 ≤ i ≤ m + n, r ≥ 1). Here, ei,j := eri,j /(r!) and hri :=
hi (hi − 1) · · · (hi − r + 1)/(r!). Following the proof of [22, Th.2], one verifies the fol-
lowing:
Lemma 2.1. The superalgebra UZ is a free Z-module with basis given by the set of all
monomials of the form
                      Y     (ai,j )
                                    Y hi         Y       d
                           ei,j                           ei,ji,j
                                            ri
                     1≤i,j≤m+n               1≤i≤m+n             1≤i,j≤m+n
                     i6=j,v i +v j =0̄                            v i +v j =1̄

for all ai,j , ri ∈ Z≥0 and di,j ∈ {0, 1}, where the product is taken in any fixed order.
    The enveloping superalgebra UC is a Hopf superalgebra in the canonical way and,
furthermore, this structure restricts to make UZ a Hopf superalgebra over Z. Finally,
set
                                     Dist(G) = k ⊗Z UZ ,
naturally a Hopf superalgebra over k. We will abuse notation by using the same
            (r)    
symbols ei,j , hri etc... for the canonical images of these elements of UZ in Dist(G).
    It is also easy to describe the superalgebras of distributions of our various natural
subgroups of G as subalgebras of Dist(G). For example, Dist(T ) is the subalgebra
generated by all hri (1 ≤ i ≤ m + n, r ≥ 1), and Dist(B) is the subalgebra generated
                        (a)
by Dist(T ) and all ei,j where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n with i < j, and a ∈ Z≥0 if v i + v j =
0̄ and a ∈ {0, 1} if v i + v j = 1̄.
    Let us describe the category of Dist(G)-supermodules. The objects are all left
Dist(G)-modules which are Z2 -graded; i.e., k-superspaces, M, satisfying Dist(G)r Ms ⊆
Mr+s for all r, s ∈ Z2 . A morphism of Dist(G)-supermodules is a linear map f :
M → M ′ satisfying f (xm) = (−1)f x xf (m) for all m ∈ M and all x ∈ Dist(G).
Note that this definition makes sense as stated only for homogeneous elements; it
          CRYSTAL STRUCTURES ARISING FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF GL(m|n)                        5


should be interpreted via linearity in the general case. We emphasize that we al-
low all morphisms and not just graded (i.e. even) morphisms. However, we note
that for superspaces M and M ′ the space Homk (M, M ′ ) is naturally Z2 -graded by
f ∈ Homk (M, M ′ )r if f (Ms ) ⊆ Ms+r′
                                          for all r, s ∈ Z2 . This gives a Z2 -grading on
                  ′                ′
HomDist(G) (M, M ) ⊆ Homk (M, M ). The category of Dist(G)-supermodules is not an
abelian category. However, the underlying even category, consisting of the same ob-
jects but only the even morphisms, is an abelian category. This, along with the parity
change functor, Π, which simply interchanges the Z2 -grading of a supermodule, allows
us to make use
             P of the tools of homological algebra.
   For λ = m+n i=1 λi εi ∈ X(T ) and a Dist(G)-supermodule M , define the λ-weight
space of M to be

We call a Dist(G)-supermodule
           P                    M integrable if it is locally finite over Dist(G) and sat-
isfies M = λ∈X(T ) Mλ . The category of G-supermodules can naturally be identified
with the category of integrable Dist(G)-supermodules [4, Corollary 3.5].
2.3. Highest Weight Theory. Given λ ∈ X(T ) let
                 D(λ) = {µ ∈ X(T ) : µ ≤ λ in the dominance order} .
Let Op denote the the full subcategory of the category  L        of all Dist(G)-supermodules
consisting of supermodules M such that M =                 λ∈X(T ) Mλ , dimk Mλ < ∞ for all
                                                                                 Sr
λ ∈ X(T ), and there are λ(1) , . . . , λ(r) ∈ X(T ) so that Mµ 6= 0 implies µ ∈ i=1 D(λ(i) )
for any µ ∈ X(T ). Note that any supermodule in Op is locally finite over Dist(B). We
also remark that in the case p = 0 Brundan’s category O discussed in the introduction
is a full subcategory of O0 . From now on we will assume all Dist(G)-supermodules
under discussion are objects in Op .
   For λ ∈ X(T ), we have the Verma module
                              M (λ) := Dist(G) ⊗Dist(B) kλ ,
where kλ denotes k viewed as a Dist(B)-supermodule of weight λ concentrated in
degree 0̄. Note that by Lemma 2.1 it follows that M (λ) is an object in Op . We say that
a homogeneous vector v in a Dist(G)-supermodule M is a primitive vector of weight
λ (or simply a primitive vector ) if Dist(B)v ∼
                                              = kλ as a Dist(B)-supermodule. Familiar
arguments exactly as for semisimple Lie algebras over C show:
Lemma 2.2. Let λ ∈ X(T ).
    (i) The λ-weight space of M (λ) is 1-dimensional, and all other weights of M (λ)
        are < λ in the dominance order.
   (ii) Any non-zero quotient of M (λ) is generated by a primitive vector of weight λ,
        unique up to scalars.
  (iii) Any Dist(G)-supermodule generated by a primitive vector of weight λ is iso-
        morphic to a quotient of M (λ).
  (iv) M (λ) has a unique maximal submodule Rad M (λ) and, hence, an irreducible
        quotient L(λ) := M (λ)/ Rad M (λ). The {L(λ)}λ∈X(T ) give a complete set of
        pairwise non-isomorphic irreducibles in Op .
  In this way, we get a parametrization of the irreducible objects in Op by their highest
weights with respect to the ordering ≤.

    Given a Dist(G)-supermodule, M, we can consider its graded dual
                                    M
                           M ∗ :=        Homk (Mλ , k)
                                         λ∈X(T )

with the usual Z2 -grading and Dist(G) action. We have an automorphism, τ, of Dist(G)
induced by ei,j 7→ −(−1)vi (vi +v j ) ej,i (the negative of the supertranspose). Twisting
M ∗ by τ yields a new Dist(G)-supermodule, which we call the contravariant dual and
denote by M τ . In particular, for λ ∈ X(T ) we define
                                        W (λ) = M (λ)τ ,                                     (2.6)
the co-Verma supermodule of highest weight λ. We remark that for a module M in
category Op we have (M τ )τ ∼
                            = M and the characters of M and M τ coincide. In
                        τ ∼
particular, we have L(λ) = L(λ) for any λ ∈ X(T ).
2.4. Crystals. Let us recall the general definition of a crystal in the sense of Kashiwara
[11, 7.2]. Assume we have the following data:
               P = a free Z-module (called the weight lattice)
               I = an index set
               αi ∈ P for all i ∈ I (called a simple root)
               hi ∈ P ∗ = HomZ (P, Z) for all i ∈ I (called a simple coroot)
               h−, −i : P × P → Q a symmetric bilinear form.
Additionally, we assume the data satisfies the following axioms:
                           hαi , αi i ∈ 2Z>0 for all i ∈ I
                           hi (λ) = 2hα   i ,λi
                                      hαi ,αi i for all i ∈ I
                           hαi , αj i ≤ 0 for all i, j ∈ I with i 6= j.
    With this fixed data, we define a crystal B as a set along with maps
                           ẽi , f˜i : B → B ⊔ {0} (for i ∈ I)
                              εi , ϕi : B → Z ⊔ {−∞} (for i ∈ I)
                                  wt : B → P
subject to the following axioms:
 (C1) ϕi (b) = εi (b) + 2hα  i ,wt(b)i
                           hαi ,αi i ;
 (C2) if ẽi (b) 6= 0, then εi (ẽi (b)) = εi (b) − 1, ϕi (ẽi (b)) = ϕi (b) + 1, and wt(ẽi (b)) =
        wt(b) + αi ;
 (C3) if f˜i (b) 6= 0, then εi (f˜i (b)) = εi (b) + 1, ϕi (f˜i (b)) = ϕi (b) − 1, and wt(f˜i (b)) =
        wt(b) − αi ;
 (C4) b1 = f˜i (b2 ) if and only if ẽi (b1 ) = b2 ;
 (C5) if ϕi (b) = −∞, then ẽi (b) = f˜i (b) = 0;
where b, b1 , b2 ∈ B and i ∈ I.

  We also remind the reader of the notion of the tensor product of two crystals. If B1
and B2 are crystals, then set B1 ⊗ B2 = {b1 ⊗ b2 : b1 ∈ B1 , b2 ∈ B2 } and
                  wt(b1 ⊗ b2 ) = wt(b1 ) + wt(b2 ),

                                                             2hαi , wt(b1 )i
                  εi (b1 ⊗ b2 ) = max εi (b1 ), εi (b2 ) −                     ,
                                                                hαi , αi i
                                                                             
                                                              2hαi , wt(b2 )i

                                                                 hαi , αi i

                                     ẽi b1 ⊗ b2 , if ϕi (b1 ) ≥ εi (b2 );
                  ẽi (b1 ⊗ b2 ) =
                                     b1 ⊗ ẽi b2 , if ϕi (b1 ) < εi (b2 );
                                   (
                                     f˜i b1 ⊗ b2 , if ϕi (b1 ) > εi (b2 );
                  f˜i (b1 ⊗ b2 ) =
                                     b1 ⊗ f˜i b2 , if ϕi (b1 ) ≤ εi (b2 ).
If M1 and M2 are Lie algebra modules with associated crystals B1 and B2 , respectively,
then by [11, Thm. 4.1] the crystal associated to M1 ⊗ M2 is B1 ⊗ B2 .
2.5. Affine Lie Algebras. Recall that we have a fixed ground field k of characteristic
p. There are two cases to consider: when p = 0 and when p > 0. In each case we define
the requisite Cartan datum in the notation of subsection 2.4 and use this data to define
an affine Lie algebra over C, g, in the manner of [9].          P
   We first consider the case when p = 0. Let P = r∈Z Zγr . The index set is Z/pZ =
Z. Define the simple roots by αr = γr − γr+1 for r ∈ Z. We define a nondegenerate
symmetric bilinear form h−, −i : P × P → Q by setting hγr , γs i = δr,s for r, s ∈ Z.
Observe that                                     
                                                 
                                                 2,       if r = s;
                                   hαr , αs i = −1, if r = s ± 1;
                                                 
                                                 
                                                   0,      otherwise;
for all r, s ∈ Z. Using the form we identify P and P ∗ via x ↔ hx, −i. Under this
identification the simple coroot hr is αr for all r ∈ Z.                   L
   Now we consider the case when p > 0. Then we let P = Zδ ⊕ r∈Z/pZ ZΛr . Again,
the index set is Z/pZ. The simple roots are defined by αr = 2Λr − Λr−1 − Λr+1 + δr,0 δ
for r ∈ Z/pZ. Let h−, −i : P × P → Q be the nondegenerate bilinear form determined
by requiring δ, Λ0 , . . . , Λp−1 and Λ0 , α0 , . . . , αp−1 to be dual bases with respect to the
form. Observe that if p > 2, then
                                           
                                           
                                           2,        if r ≡ s (mod p);
                             hαr , αs i = −1, if r ≡ s ± 1 (mod p);
                                           
                                           
                                              0,      otherwise;
and if p = 2, then                      (
                                            2,    if r ≡ s (mod 2);
                         hαr , αs i =
                                            −2,   if r ≡ s + 1 (mod 2);
for all r, s ∈ Z/pZ. In particular
                            L      this implies the form is symmetric. Using the form
we identify Q := ZΛ0 ⊕ r∈Z/pZ Zαr ⊆ P with P ∗ via x ↔ hx, −i. Under this
identification, the simple coroot hr is αr for all r ∈ Z/pZ. Finally, given a ∈ Z we
write a = pd + s with d ∈ Z and s = 1, . . . , p and define γa ∈ P by
                                    γa = Λs − Λs−1 − dδ.
8                                      JONATHAN KUJAWA


Observe that if a = pd + s, then γa − γa+1 = αs .
  In both cases we define a Lie algebra over C, g, generated by h := P ⊗Z C and
{Er , Fr : r ∈ Z/pZ} subject to the relations
                                   [Er , Fs ] = δr,s αr

extended to h. Note that if p = 0, then g = gl∞ (C). If p > 0, then g = sl
2.6. The Crystal B. We are now prepared to describe the crystal which plays a
central role in this paper. Let V denote the natural “evaluation” g-module with basis
{xb : b ∈ Z} and action given by
                                 (
                                   xb−1 , if r + 1 ≡ b (mod p);
                         Er xb =
                                   0,     otherwise;
                                 (
                                   xb+1 , if r ≡ b (mod p);
                         Fr xb =
                                   0,     otherwise;
                            Hxb = hH, γb ixb for all H ∈ h,
where g is the affine Lie algebra defined in subsection 2.5. We say a vector x ∈ V is of
weight λ ∈ P if Hx = hH, λix for all H ∈ h.
    There is a crystal (B0̄ , ẽr , f˜r , εr , ϕr , wt) associated to the module V (for both p = 0
and p > 0) where the underlying set B0̄ is {xb : b ∈ Z} (the given basis). The crystal
operators are defined by ẽr = Er and f˜r = Fr for all r ∈ Z/pZ and, given b ∈ Z,
εr (xb ) = 1, if r + 1 ≡ b (mod p) and is zero otherwise; and ϕr (xb ) = 1, if r ≡ b (mod p)
and is zero otherwise. Finally, wt is the usual weight function on V, hence wt(xb ) = γb
for all b ∈ Z. We leave it to the reader to verify the crystal axioms.
    We have an automorphism of g given by
                                           Er 7→ Fr ,
                                           Fr 7→ Er ,
                                            H 7→ −H,
for all r ∈ Z/pZ and all H ∈ h. We can twist V by this automorphism and obtain a
new g-module, V . This module also has an associated crystal (B1̄ , ẽr , f˜r , εr , ϕr , wt)
                    ∨


which is, roughly speaking, B0̄ with the roles of ẽr and f˜r interchanged. Namely, the
                           ∨                                                             ∨
crystal B1̄ is the set {xb : b ∈ Z} (the given basis of V viewed as a basis of V ), where
we set ẽr (xb ) = f˜r (xb ) , f˜r (xb ) = ẽr (xb ) , εr (xb ) = ϕr (xb ), ϕr (xb ) = εr (xb ), and
             ∨              ∨        ∨              ∨          ∨                 ∨

                   f˜∗ (x) := −ẽ−1−r (−x), ϕ∗ (x) := ε−1−r (−x),

See [1] for a discussion of the sense in which these crystal structures are dual to one
another. In the next subsection we will give a more explicit combinatorial description
of the dual crystal B.
2.7. The Crystal Structure on X(T ). We now lift the dual crystal structure on
B to X(T ). To do so we require some additional notation. Let ρ ∈ X(T ) denote the
unique element which satisfies the following conditions:
                                        (
                                          1, if v m+n = 0̄;

and for 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n − 1,

                                            

                           (ρ, εi − εi+1 ) = −1,       if v i = v i+1 = 1̄;
                                            
                                            
                                              0,       if v i 6= v i+1 .
For 1 ≤ j ≤ m + n, let
                                             m+n
                                             X

As an example, say our fixed homogeneous basis for V satisfies v i = 1̄ if 1 ≤ i ≤ n and
v i = 0̄ if n + 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n (the parity choice in [1]), then we have
           ϑ = −(m − n + 1)ε1 + · · · + −mεm + (m − 1)εn+1 + · · · + εm+n−1 ,
           ρ = −(m − n + 1)ε1 + · · · + −mεm + mεn+1 + · · · + εm+n .
     We define a bijection X(T ) → B by
                                                                v

                                                         m+n
                                             ⊗ · · · ⊗ x(λ+ρ,εm+n )
                                                                    .                     (2.10)
Using this bijection we can lift the dual crystal structure on B to the set X(T ). Let
us describe the combinatorics of this crystal structure explicitly. It is convenient to
use a combinatorial description of the crystal tensor product rule which uses certain
sequences commonly called signatures. See, for example, [7, Sec. 4.4].
   For λ ∈ X(T ) and 1 ≤ j ≤ m + n, define the j-residue of λ to be
                           rj (λ) = (λ + ϑ, εj )                                          (2.11)
                                    (
                                      (λ + ρ − εj , εj ),            if v j = 0̄;
                                  =
                                      (λ + ρ, εj ),                  if v j = 1̄.
Fix r ∈ Z/pZ and λ ∈ X(T ). The r-signature of λ ∈ X(T ) is
                                   σr (λ) = (σ1 , . . . , σm+n ),
where                                 
                                      
                                      +, if ri (λ + εi ) ≡ r (mod p);
                                 σi = −, if ri (λ) ≡ r (mod p);                           (2.12)
                                      
                                      
                                        0,    else.
Given the r-signature of λ we form the reduced r-signature by successively replacing
−+ pairs with 00 (where the − and + may be separated by zeros, which are ignored)
until no − appears to the left of a +. Given an r-signature σ = (σ1 , . . . , σm+n ), we write
σ̃ = (σ̃1 , . . . , σ̃m+n ) for the reduced r-signature. In particular, given λ ∈ X(T ) we write
σ̃r (λ) for the reduced r-signature of λ. We then define ẽ∗r , f˜r∗ : X(T ) → X(T ) ⊔ {0} by
                (
                    λ − εj , if 1 ≤ j ≤ m + n is the position of the leftmost − in σ̃r (λ);
     ẽ∗r (λ) =
                    0,         if there are no −’s in σ̃r (λ);
                (
                    λ + εj , if 1 ≤ j ≤ m + n is the position of the rightmost + in σ̃r (λ);
    f˜r∗ (λ) =
                    0,         if there are no +’s in σ̃r (λ).
We also define
         ε∗r (λ) = max(a ≥ 0 : (ẽ∗r )a (λ) 6= 0) = the total number of −’s in σ̃r (λ),
         ϕ∗ (λ) = max(a ≥ 0 : (f˜∗ )a (λ) 6= 0) = the total number of +’s in σ̃r (λ).

is the crystal of interest in the present work. We emphasize that this crystal structure
on X(T ) depends on (but only on) the sequence of parities v 1 , . . . , v m+n which we
fixed at the beginning.
2.8. Main Results. We can now summarize our main results. Namely, that the
crystal on X(T ) given in (2.14) describes aspects of the category Op .
   In section 3 we prove that the function wt given as part of the crystal structure on
X(T ) partitions the central characters of Dist(G) arising from the irreducible super-
modules of category Op . In particular if L(λ) and L(µ) have the same central character,
then wt(λ) = wt(µ). As a consequence we obtain the following linkage principle.
Theorem 2.3. Let λ, µ ∈ X(T ). If
                              Ext1Dist(G) (L(λ), L(µ)) 6= 0,
then wt(λ) = wt(µ).
   To continue we need to define certain translation functors on category Op . These
functors should be compared with the translation functors defined by Jantzen [8, II.7],
Brundan and Kleshchev [3], and Brundan [1]. For ν ∈ P, define Opν to be the full
subcategory of Op of all modules with all their irreducible subquotients isomorphic to
L(λ) for some λ ∈ X(T ) with wt(λ) = ν. Let M be a Dist(G)-supermodule lying in
category Op . Fix λ ∈ X(T ). Since Z(Dist(G)), the center of Dist(G), leaves Mλ invari-
ant, we can view it as a commuting family of endomorphisms of the finite dimensional
superspace Mλ . Consequently, we have the direct sum decomposition as superspaces
                                          M χ
                                    Mλ =      Mλ
where the sum runs over all central characters, χ : Z(Dist(G)) → k, and where
    Mλχ = {m ∈ Mλ : (z − χ(z))N m = 0 for every z ∈ Z(Dist(G)) and N >> 0}.
                         L
Consequently, since M =    λ∈X(T ) Mλ , we have the direct sum decomposition as
Dist(G)-supermodules                   M
                                 M=        Mχ
where again sum runs over all central characters, χ : Z(Dist(G)) → k, and where
    M χ = {m ∈ M : (z − χ(z))N m = 0 for every z ∈ Z(Dist(G)) and N >> 0 }.
  However, by our above remarks we can rewrite the decomposition as
                                      M
                                 M=       Mν
where the sum runs over all ν ∈ P and M ν is a Dist(G)-supermodule lying in category
Opν . That is, we have
                                         M
                                   Op =       Opν .                           (2.15)
                                            ν∈P
Let prν be the projection functor from Op to Opν . For r ∈ Z/pZ we now define the
functors
                                     Er , Fr : Op → Op .                       (2.16)
                                                         ν            ν
By additivity, it suffices to define them on objects in Op . Let M ∈ Op , then
     Er M := prν+γr −γr+1 (M ⊗ V ∗ )    and Fr M := prν−γr +γr+1 (M ⊗ V ),       (2.17)
where V denotes the natural G-supermodule and V ∗ denotes its dual. On a morphism
ϕ : M → N , Er ϕ and Fr ϕ are the restriction of the map ϕ ⊗ 1.

   In section 5 we prove that the action of these translation functors on irreducible
supermodules is regulated by the crystal structure on X(T ). Namely, we have the
following theorem:
Theorem 2.4. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and r ∈ Z/pZ.
   (i) Er L(λ) 6= 0 if and only if ε∗r (λ) 6= 0, in which case it is a self-dual indecompos-
       able module with irreducible socle and cosocle both isomorphic to L(µ) where
       µ = ẽ∗r (λ). Moreover, Er L(λ) is irreducible if and only if ε∗r (λ) = 1.
  (ii) Fr L(λ) 6= 0 if and only if ϕ∗r (λ) 6= 0, in which case it is a self-dual indecompos-
       able module with irreducible socle and cosocle both isomorphic to L(µ) where
       µ = f˜r∗ (λ). Moreover, Fr L(λ) is irreducible if and only if ϕ∗r (λ) = 1.
   As a corollary to the previous theorem we also obtain an explicit description of
the socle of L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ and L(λ) ⊗ V and combinatorial criterion for when these
supermodules are semisimple.

                                     3. Central Characters
3.1. Some Central Elements. Following Sergeev [20] (where the characteristic zero
case was considered), we define certain central elements of Dist(G). Recall from sub-
section 2.2 that {ei,j : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n} is the usual homogeneous basis for the Lie
                                       [r]
superalgebra associated to G. Define xk,l ∈ Dist(G) inductively as follows:
                               [1]
                             xk,l = ek,l                                              (3.1)
                                      m+n
                                      X
                               [r]                       [r−1]
                             xk,l =         (−1)vs ek,s xs,l     , for r > 1.         (3.2)
                                      s=1

Lemma 3.1. Let 1 ≤ i, j, k, l ≤ m + n and r ∈ Z, r ≥ 1. Then,
                  [r]
      (i) The xk,l are homogeneous of degree v k + v l ,
                  [r]          [r]                                [r]
      (ii) [ei,j , xk,l ] = δj,k xi,l − (−1)(vi +v j )(vk +vl ) δi,l xk,j ,
                                       P       [r]
     (iii) The elements Z̃r := m+n       k=1 xk,k for r ≥ 1 are central.

Proof. Each of the statements is a straightforward induction on r.                        
     For r ∈ Z let                                X
                             Zr = Z̃r − (−1)r         (−1)vk1 +···+vkr ϑkr ,          (3.3)
where the sum runs over all 1 ≤ k1 < · · · < kr ≤ m + n and ϑi is as in (2.7). Since
Zr differs from Z̃r by a scalar, these elements are still central and generate the same
subalgebra of Dist(G). We remark that if char k = 0 one can use the results of [21] to
prove that these elements in fact generate Z(Dist(G)).
3.2. The Linkage Principle. Multiplication by an element of Z(Dist(G)) defines an
endomorphism of M (λ) (λ ∈ X(T )) so takes the canonical generator vλ ∈ M (λ)λ
to scalar multiple of itself. From this we conclude that the elements of Z(Dist(G))0̄
must act by scalars on M (λ) and any of its subquotients. We now prove that the even
central element Zr defined in the previous subsection acts on M (λ) by the scalar Zr (λ)
given below.
   For 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n define
                                       ri = (−1)vi (ei,i + ϑi ),                      (3.4)

where ϑi is as defined in (2.7). Observe that if M is a Dist(G)-supermodule and
v ∈ Mλ , then ri v = ri (λ)v, the ith residue of λ (2.11). Given λ ∈ X(T ) define the

Lemma 3.2. If M is a Dist(G)-supermodule and v ∈ Mλ (for some λ ∈ X(T )) is
annihilated by all ei,j when 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m + n, then Zr v = Zr (λ)v.
Proof. Given our assumption that v is annihilated by all ei,j when i < j, it suffices
to work work modulo the left ideal generated by these elements. We shall write ≡ for
congruence modulo this ideal. We shall prove the statement via several intermediate
claims:
           [r]
Claim 1. xk,l ≡ 0 for each 1 ≤ k < l ≤ m + n, and r ≥ 1.
   We prove this by inducting on r with the base case being clear. For r > 1 by the
induction hypothesis, Lemma 3.1(ii), and (3.1) we have:

We now observe that the first sum is (3.7) in all cases when as ≥ 1, the second sum
(after reindexing) is (3.7) for as = 0 and s = 2, . . . , r plus one additional term which
exactly cancels the third sum. It remains to note that the final possible case (when
s = 1 and as = 0) in fact does not occur in (3.7).
   Finally, since rt v = rt (λ)v, Claim 4 exactly implies the statement given in the
lemma.                                                                                  

Comparing the multiplicity of zeros and poles we see Gλ (t) = Gµ (t) if and only if
Ar (λ) − Br (λ) = Ar (µ) − Br (µ) for r ∈ Z/pZ.
   To prove (iii) ⇔ (iv), we need to analyze the weight function more closely. In
characteristic zero, we have
                  h(−1)vi γ(λ+ρ,εi ) , αr i = h(−1)vi γ(λ+ρ,εi ) , γr − γr+1 i

                                                0,     otherwise.
That is, hwt(λ), αr i = Ar (λ) − Br (λ) for all r ∈ Z. Now if λ, µ ∈ X(T ) with wt(λ) =
wt(µ), then                X
                       0=      hwt(λ) − wt(µ), rγr i = l(λ) − l(µ),

and, for all r ∈ Z,
            0 = hwt(λ) − wt(µ), αr i = (Ar (λ) − Br (λ)) − (Ar (µ) − Br (µ)).
That is, (iv) ⇒ (iii). To prove the converse, first observe that wt(λ) − wt(µ) lies in
the Z-span of the αr ’s so we can fix N > 0 so that wt(λ) − wt(µ) lies in the Z-span
of {α−N , . . . , αN }. If (iii) holds, then hwt(λ) − wt(µ), αr i = 0 for −N ≤ r ≤ N. That
is, wt(λ) − wt(µ) lies in the radical of the form restricted to this sublattice. However,
the form is nondegenerate on this sublattice. This implies wt(λ) = wt(µ).

the form is nondegenerate on h. Consequently, (iv) holds if and only if wt(λ) = wt(µ).

  We can now deduce the main results of this section.
Theorem 3.4. Let λ, µ ∈ X(T ). If L(µ) is a subquotient of M (λ), then wt(λ) = wt(µ).
Proof. If L(µ) is a composition factor of M (λ), then Z(Dist(G))0̄ acts by the same
scalars on both. If we set                 Pm+n        

                                     dr =
                                                  r
for r ∈ Z≥0 , a direct calculation verifies that these even elements of Dist(G) are central.
Furthermore, dl(λ) acts by 1 and dr acts by 0 for all r > l(λ) (c.f. [5, Remark 2, Sec.
3.8]). Consequently, l(λ) = l(µ). Additionally, we have Zr (λ) = Zr (µ) for all r ∈ Z.
Taken together with Lemma 3.3 this implies wt(λ) = wt(µ).                                 
Lemma 3.5. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and D be a Dist(G)-supermodule such that if µ ∈ X(T )
with λ < µ in the dominance order, then Dµ = 0. Then
                                   Ext1Dist(G) (M (λ), D) = 0.
Moreover, for arbitrary λ, µ ∈ X(T ) we have
                               Ext1Dist(G) (M (λ), W (µ)) = 0.
Proof. Consider a short exact sequence
                                0 → D → N → M (λ) → 0.

Let vλ′ ∈ N be a homogeneous preimage of vλ , the canonical generator of M (λ). By the
weight assumption we have that vλ′ is a primitive vector of weight λ. By the universal
property of M (λ) there is a homomorphism which maps vλ 7→ vλ′ , providing a splitting
of the sequence. Hence Ext1Dist(G) (M (λ), D) = 0.
   Now if λ, µ ∈ X(T ) are arbitrary, by contravariant duality we have
                 Ext1       (M (λ), W (µ)) ∼
                       Dist(G)             = Ext1      (M (µ), W (λ)),
                                                     Dist(G)
so we can assume without loss that λ 6< µ. The result then immediately follows.                 
Lemma 3.6. If λ, µ ∈ X(T ) with λ 6< µ, then
            HomDist(G) (Rad M (λ), L(µ)) ∼ = Ext1        Dist(G) (L(λ), L(µ)).

In particular, for all λ ∈ X(T )
                                 Ext1Dist(G) (L(λ), L(λ)) = 0.
Proof. Let R denote Rad M (λ). Consider the short exact sequence
                                 0 → R → M (λ) → L(λ) → 0.
Applying the functor HomDist(G) (−, L(µ)) we obtain the long exact sequence
     0 → HomDist(G) (L(λ), L(µ)) → HomDist(G) (M (λ), L(µ)) →
                   → HomDist(G) (R, L(µ)) → Ext1Dist(G) (L(λ), L(µ)) →
                                                        → Ext1Dist(G) (M (λ), L(µ)) → . . . .
We note that the map HomDist(G) (L(λ), L(µ)) → HomDist(G) (M (λ), L(µ)) is an iso-
morphism. Since λ 6< µ, by Lemma 3.5 we have that Ext1Dist(G) (M (λ), L(µ)) = 0. The
result immediately follows. The triviality of Ext1Dist(G) (L(λ), L(λ)) follows by a weight
argument.                                                                               
Theorem 3.7. Let λ, µ ∈ X(T ). If
                                 Ext1Dist(G) (L(λ), L(µ)) 6= 0,
then wt(λ) = wt(µ).
Proof. By contravariant duality we have
                     Ext1Dist(G) (L(λ), L(µ)) ∼
                                              = Ext1Dist(G) (L(µ), L(λ)),
so we may assume without loss that λ 6< µ in the dominance order. By Lemma 3.6, we
can then deduce that L(µ) is a quotient of Rad M (λ), hence a subquotient of M (λ).
Finally, one applies Theorem 3.4.                                                

                                  4. Lowering operators
      In a series of papers ([12], [13], [14]) Kleshchev gave certain elements of the algebra of
distributions of SL(n) called lowering operators which allowed him to prove modular
branching rules for SL(n), and via Schur functor arguments, the symmetric group.
Brundan generalized Kleshchev’s construction to the case of quantum GL(n). In this
section we develop the appropriate theory for the supergroup G = GL(V ) and use
them to prove a representation theoretic interpretation of the crystal operators ẽ∗r and
f˜r∗ .

4.1. A Combinatorial Interlude. We now introduce the super analogue of Kleshchev’s
combinatorial notions of normal, conormal, good, and cogood. We first define them
in terms of the crystal structure on X(T ) and then relate them to the appropriate
generalization of Kleshchev’s original definitions. Let r ∈ Z/pZ and λ ∈ X(T ).
Definition 4.1. We define 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n to be r-normal for λ if one of the following
equivalent conditions hold:
    (1) (ẽ∗r )a+1 (λ) = (ẽ∗r )a (λ) − εi for some a ∈ Z≥0 ;
    (2) i is the position of a − in the reduced r-signature of λ.
Definition 4.2. We define 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n to be r-good for λ if one of the following
equivalent conditions hold:
    (1) ẽ∗r (λ) = λ − εi ;
    (2) i is the position of the leftmost − in the reduced r-signature of λ.
   We also have the analogous definitions for f˜r∗ :
Definition 4.3. We define 1 ≤ i ≤ m+n to be r-conormal for λ if one of the following
equivalent conditions hold:
    (1) (f˜r∗ )a+1 (λ) = (f˜r∗ )a (λ) + εi for some a ∈ Z≥0 ;
    (2) i is the position of a + in the reduced r-signature of λ.
Definition 4.4. We define 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n to be r-cogood for λ if one of the following
equivalent conditions hold:
    (1) f˜r∗ (λ) = λ + εi ;
    (2) i is the position of the rightmost + in the reduced r-signature of λ.
   We call 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n normal (resp. good, conormal, cogood ) for λ if i is r-normal
(resp. r-good, r-conormal, r-cogood) for λ for some r ∈ Z/pZ.
Example 4.5. Assume our fixed homogeneous basis for V satisfies v i = 1̄ if 1 ≤ i ≤ n
and v i = 0̄ if n+1 ≤ i ≤ m+n. Consider the crystal structure (X(T ), ẽ∗r , f˜r∗ , ε∗r , ϕ∗r , wt).
Let p = 3, m = 3, n = 2, and
                              λ = ε1 − ε2 + ε3 + 7ε4 + 5ε5 ∈ X(T ).
The signatures of λ are: σ0 (λ) = (+, +, −, +, +), σ1 (λ) = (−, −, +, 0, 0), and σ2 (λ) =
(0, 0, 0, −, −). The reduced signatures of λ are: σ̃0 (λ) = (+, +, 0, 0, +), σ̃1 (λ) =
(−, 0, 0, 0, 0), and σ̃2 (λ) = (0, 0, 0, −, −). Then for λ : 1 is 1-normal and 1-good; 4
and 5 are 2-normal with 4 being 2-good; 1, 2 and 5 are 0-conormal with 5 being 0-
cogood.
   We now relate these crystal theoretic definitions to the super analogue of Kleshchev’s
original definitions. To do so we require additional notation. Given 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m + n,
let (i..j) = {i + 1, . . . , j − 1}, (i..j] = {i + 1, . . . , j}, [i..j) = {i, . . . , j − 1}, and [i..j] =
{i, . . . , j}. Given A ⊆ {1, . . . , m+n} let Ai..j = A∩(i..j). Given A, B ⊆ {1, . . . , m+n},
we write A ↓ B if there exists an injective map θ : A → B with θ(a) ≤ a for all a ∈ A.
An equivalent definition is to say A ↓ B if |A∩[1..k]| ≤ |B ∩[1..k]| for all 1 ≤ k ≤ m+n.
This defines a partial order on the subsets of {1, . . . , m + n}.
   For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n, 1 ≤ k ≤ m + n − 1, and λ ∈ X(T ), let

Let 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m + n. Define the following subsets of {1, . . . , m + n}:
                         Ci,j (λ) = {h ∈ (i..j) : ci,h (λ) ≡ 0 (mod p)},                       (4.3)
                         Bi,j (λ) = {h ∈ [i..j) : bi,h (λ) ≡ 0 (mod p)}.                       (4.4)
   Let λ ∈ X(T ) and let 1 ≤ i, h ≤ m + n. The following remarks are immediate from
the definitions.
Remark 4.6. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and let 1 ≤ i, h ≤ m + n, then
  (1) h ∈ Ci,m+n (λ) if and only if i < h < n and ri (λ) ≡ rh (λ) (mod p);
  (2) h ∈ Bi,m+n (λ) if and only if i ≤ h < n and ri (λ) ≡ rh+1 (λ + εh+1 ) (mod p).
  Using the above remarks and the definitions of normal and good, a straightforward
combinatorial argument proves the following result.
Lemma 4.7. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n. Then i is normal for λ if and only
if Bi,m+n (λ) ↓ Ci,m+n (λ). Furthermore, i is good for λ if and only if i is normal and
there is no j which is normal, j < i, and cj,i (λ) ≡ 0 (mod p).
   We remark that in the purely even case these are the definitions of normal and good
used by Brundan. They are transpose to those given by Kleshchev (see [2]).
   We end this subsection with two combinatorial results which will be useful later. A
straightforward combinatorial argument proves the following lemma.
Lemma 4.8. Given 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n, r ∈ Z/pZ, and λ ∈ X(T ), i is r-good for λ if and
only if i is r-normal for λ and i is r-conormal for λ − εi .
   The following lemma links the notions of normal and good with conormal and
cogood, respectively. Let us fix some notation which we will use again in subsection 4.5.
Let w0 denote the longest element of Sm+n . Let Ve denote a superspace with dimk Ve0̄ =
n and dimk Ve1̄ = m and let G e denote GL(Ve ). Fix a homogeneous basis ve1 , . . . ., vem+n
satisfying
                                         vei = v w0 i + 1̄
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n, where v1 , . . . , vm+n is our usual fixed basis for V. Let us write
Te ∼
   = T for the subgroup of all diagonal matrices of G.      e Following the procedure discussed
                                                                    Lm+n
in subsection 2.7, we put a crystal structure on X(Te) = i=1                 Zεi lifted from the dual
crystal                                                                     

                                              v

     Let s̃ : X(T ) → X(Te) be given by
                                           εi 7→ −εw0 i                                        (4.5)
for 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n.
Lemma 4.9. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and 1 ≤ t ≤ m + n. Then t is normal for λ if and only
if w0 t is conormal for s̃(λ). Moreover, t is good for λ if and only if w0 t is cogood for
s̃(λ).
Proof. Let r ∈ Z/pZ. Recall our notation σr (λ) = (σr (λ)1 , . . . , σr (λ)m+n ) for the r-
signature of λ. Given 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m + n, we call (i, j) an r-canceling pair for λ if
σr (λ)i = −, σr (λ)j = +, and σk (λ)t = 0 for i < k < j.
                                                            Pm+n
   Given λ ∈ X(T ) and 1 ≤ t ≤ m + n, let ξ denote k=1 (−1)vk , r = rt (λ), and
r′ = r − ξ. It is straightforward to verify that (i, j) is an r-canceling pair for λ if and
          CRYSTAL STRUCTURES ARISING FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF GL(m|n)                    21


only if (w0 j, w0 i) is an r′ -canceling pair for s̃(λ). This along with our combinatorial
description of the crystal structure on X(T ) immediately implies t is normal for λ if
and only if w0 t is conormal for s̃(λ). It is clear from the definitions that i is good for
λ if and only if w0 i is cogood for s̃(λ).                                               
4.2. Lowering Operators. In what follows for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m + n and 1 ≤ k ≤ m + n
we write Ei,j = ei,j , Fi,j = ej,i , and Hk = ek,k . For 1 ≤ j ≤ m + n, let
                                        j−1
                                        X
                                Lj =          (−1)vi Fi,j Ei,j .                     (4.6)
                                        i=1
A straightforward calculation shows that the Lj ’s commute with one another and,
since they are of weight 0, with any element of Dist(T ).
   For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n and 1 ≤ k ≤ m + n − 1, let
                  ci,j = (−1)vi Hi − (−1)vj Hj + (−1)vi ϑi − (−1)vj ϑj ,             (4.7)

                                   c̃i,j = ci,j + (−1)vi ,                           (4.8)
and let
               bi,k = (−1)vi Hi − (−1)vk+1 Hk+1 + (−1)vi ϑi − (−1)vk ϑk .            (4.9)
Note that this notation is compatible with that of subsection 4.1 in the sense that if
M is a Dist(G)-supermodule with v ∈ Mλ then the elements ci,j , bi,k ∈ Dist(G) act on
v by the scalars ci,j (λ) and bi,k (λ), respectively.
   For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m + n and A ⊆ (i..j), define
                                                                    !
                                    Y
                       Sei,j (A) =      (c̃i,t − Li+1 − · · · − Lt ) Fi,j .     (4.10)
                                  t∈A
Note that our observations on the commutativity of the Lj ’s imply that the order of
the product does not need to be specified.
   Let B − denote the opposite Borel subgroup of G consisting of all lower triangular
invertible matrices of the form (2.1). Let U denote the unipotent radical of B given
by letting U (A) ⊆ B(A) be the set of upper triangular unipotent matrices for any
commutative superalgebra A. Fix an ordering of the PBW basis (see Lemma 2.1) of
Dist(G) so that each PBW monomial is of the form XY where X ∈ Dist(B − ) and
Y ∈ Dist(U ). We define the lowering operators Si,j (A) by expanding Sei,j (A) in the
PBW basis given by this ordering and taking Si,j (A) to be the sum of those terms
lying in Dist(B − ). The idea is that we are interested applying the lowering operators
to primitive vectors and the nonconstant elements of Dist(U ) annihilate all primitive
vectors. Consequently, in many of our calculations we will work modulo a left ideal of
Dist(G) which annihilates any primitive vector. The following lemma illustrates this
point of view.

Lemma 4.10. Let J be the left ideal of Dist(G) generated by the nonconstant elements
of Dist(U ). Let 1 ≤ i < t < j ≤ m + n. Then:
     (i) Lt Fi,j ≡ −aFi,t Ft,j (mod J) where a = (−1)vi +(v i +vt )(vi +v j ) ;
    (ii) (c̃i,t − Li+1 − · · · − Lt )Lt Fi,j ≡ 0 (mod J);
Proof. Throughout we write ≡ for congruent modulo J.
  To prove (i) we simply calculate the left hand side working modulo J:
                      X
            Lt Fi,j =   (−1)vr et,r er,t ej,i
                                   r<t
                                   X
                               =         (−1)vr et,r ((−1)(vi +vj )(vr +vt ) ej,i er,t + [er,t , ej,i ])
                                   r<t
                                     X
                               ≡−     (−1)vr +(vr +vt )(vj +vi ) δi,r et,r ej,t
                                     r<t

                               = −(−1)vi +(vi +vt )(vi +v j ) et,i ej,t
                               = −aFi,t Ft,j .
     To prove (ii) one uses (i) and calculates that
                                                                                   X
       (c̃i,t − Li+1 − · · · − Lt−1 )Lt Fi,j ≡ −ac̃i,t Fi,t Ft,j + a                      Lr Fi,t Ft,j
                                                                                  i<r<t
                                                       ≡ −ac̃i,t Fi,t Ft,j
                                                                    X
                                                                −          (−1)(vj +vr )(vi +vt ) Fi,r Fr,t Ft,j .
                                                                     i<r<t
On the other hand, one calculates that
                                    Lt Lt Fi,j ≡ −aLt Fi,t Ft,j
                                                    X
                                               ≡ −a    (−1)vr et,r er,t et,i ej,t .
                                                          r<t
However,
                                 
                                 

                                                                                     
         et,r er,t et,i ej,t   ≡    ei,i − (−1)vi +v t et,t + (−1)vi +vt + 1 et,i ej,t                if r = i;
                                 
                                 
                                   et,i ej,t + (−1)(vt +vr )(vr +v i ) er,i et,r ej,t                 if r > i.
Together, these imply
                                                           X
             Lt Lt Fi,j ≡ −ac̃i,t Fi,t Ft,j − a                  (−1)(vt +vr )(vr +vi )+vr Fi,r Fr,t Ft,j .
                                                          i<r<t

Finally, through the miracle of Z2 , we have v i +(v i +v t )(v i +vj )+(v t +v r )(v r +v i )+v r =
(v j + v r )(v i + v t ) which implies the desired result.                                         
   A useful fact about the lowering operators, both for calculating them and for proving
results, is the recurrence relation given in the following theorem.
Theorem 4.11. Let i ≤ i < j ≤ m + n, and let A ⊆ (i..j). If A = ∅, then Si,j (A) =
Fi,j . Otherwise, take any k ∈ A and let h = max([i..k)\A), then we have
     Si,j (A) = Si,j (A\{k})ch,k + (1 − δh,i )Si,j (A\{k} ∪ {h}) + aSi,k (Ai..k )Sk,j (Ak..j ),
                                                                                         (4.11)
where a = (−1)vi +(vi +v k )(vi +v j ) .

Proof. Throughout we write ≡ for equivalence modulo the left ideal J generated by
the nonconstant elements of Dist(U ). If h 6= i, then
c̃i,k − Li+1 − · · · − Lk = ch,k + (c̃i,h − Li+1 − · · · − Lh ) − (Lh+1 + · · · + Lk−1 ) − Lk .
Using this equation, we replace the kth term in the product in the definition of Sei,j (A).
Distributing yields Si,j (A) ≡ Sei,j (A) ≡ P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 where
          Y                                      Y

4.3. Technical Lemmas. We now prove several technical lemmas about the lowering
operators which will be useful in what follows. The proof of the lemmas in this sub-
section follow the arguments of the analogous results of Brundan in [2]. The exception
is the proof of Lemma 4.13. This proof is new and is simpler than Brundan’s proof of
the analogous result, which requires the introduction of certain formal polynomials.
    The following lemma records how the lowering operators commute with El = El,l+1 .

           where                   (
                                       (−1)(vi +vi+1 )(v i +vj ) ,       if l = i;
                              b=
                                       (−1)vi +(vi +vl+1 )(vi +v j ) ,        6 i.
                                                                         if l =
      (iii) If l = j − 1 ∈
                         / {i} ∪ A, then
                                   El Si,j (A) ≡ Si,j−1 (A) (mod Jl ).
      (iv) If l = j − 1 ∈ A and h = max([i · · · l)\A), then
      El Si,j (A) ≡ Si,j−1 (Ai..j−1 )bh,j−1 + (1 − δi,h )Si,j−1 (A\{j − 1} ∪ {h}) (mod Jl ).
           where bh,j−1 is as defined in (4.9).
Proof. Throughout we write ≡ for equivalence modulo Jl . Define the height of a subset
A ⊆ {1, . . . , m + n} by                  X
                                  ht(A) =     k.
                                                           k∈A
   To prove (i) we induct on ht(A). The base cases are if A = ∅ or if A 6= ∅ and
ht(A) = ht({i + 1}), the minimal nonzero value the height function obtains. If A = ∅
then necessarily condition (b) holds. A direct calculation shows that El Si,j (A) =
El Fi,j ≡ 0. If ht(A) = ht({i + 1}) then A = {i + 1} and by Theorem 4.11 we have
                   Si,j (A) = Fi,j ci,i+1 + (−1)vi +(vi +vi+1 )(vi +vj ) Fi,i+1 Fi+1,j .
A calculation using this and condition (b) shows El Si,j (A) ≡ 0. If A = {i + 1} and
condition (a) holds, then l = i and again a calculation shows El Si,j (A) ≡ 0.
   Now suppose ht(A) > ht({i + 1}) and the result holds for all sets of smaller height.
If A = {l + 1}, then by our inductive assumption l 6= i and by applying Theorem 4.11
twice we obtain
     Si,j (A) = Fi,j cl−1,l+1 + (1 − δi,l−1 )Si,j ({l − 1}) + (−1)vi +(vi +v l )(vi +vj ) Fi,l Fl,j
                                                               + (−1)vi +(vi +l+1)(vi +vj ) Fi,l+1 Fl+1,j .
The result then follows from a direct calculation and the observation that ht({l − 1}) =
ht(A) − 2 so by the inductive hypothesis El Si,j ({l − 1}) ≡ 0. Otherwise, if A 6= {l + 1},
then we can choose k ∈ A with k 6= l + 1 and apply theorem 4.11 and the inductive
hypothesis to prove the result if either condition (a) or (b) holds.
   Now we prove (ii). First one proves the case l = i by inducting on ht(A). If
ht(A) = 0 then A = ∅ and the result follows from a direct computation. Now if we
assume ht(A) > 0 and the statement holds for all lesser heights, then we can choose
k ∈ A and the result follows from Theorem 4.11, Lemma 4.12(i), and the inductive
         CRYSTAL STRUCTURES ARISING FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF GL(m|n)                     25


hypothesis. To prove the case when l 6= i, one uses Theorem 4.11 with k = l and the
previous case.
   One proves (iii) by using Theorem 4.11 to induct on ht(A).
   One proves (iv) by applying Theorem 4.11 and the previous parts of the lemma. 
Lemma 4.13. Let M be a Dist(G)-supermodule and let v ∈ Mλ be a primitive vector of
weight λ ∈ X(T ). Let 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m+n and let A, B ⊆ (i..j) with |A| = |B| and A ↓ B.
Furthermore, assume ci,h (λ) ≡ 0 (mod p) for h ∈ (i..j)\A, and bi,h (λ) ≡ 0 (mod p) for
h ∈ (i..j)\B. Then,
                                                     Y
                       Ei · · · Ej−1 Si,j (A).vλ = ε    bi,t (λ)vλ               (4.13)
                                                          t∈{i}∪B

where ε = ±1.
Proof. We prove the statement by induction on d(i, j) := |(i..j)|. The base case is
d(i, j) = 0. Then A = B = ∅, j = i + 1, and the left hand side of (4.13) is
                            Ei Fi,j .vλ = ei,j ej,i .vλ
                                                                 
                                        = ei,i − (−1)vi +v j ej,j .vλ
                                        = (−1)vi bi,i (λ)vλ ,
which is the right hand side of (4.13). In this case, incidentally, ε = (−1)vi .
  Now we assume d(i, j) > 0 and that (4.13) holds for all smaller d(i, j). We proceed
by considering cases:
  Case 1: Say j − 1 ∈  / A. Observe that this along with A ↓ B implies j − 1 ∈   / B.
Then the left hand side of (4.13) is

                     Ei · · · Ej−1 Si,j (A).vλ = Ei · · · Ej−2 Si,j−1 (A).vλ
                                                     Y
                                               =ε           bi,t (λ)vλ
                                                     t∈{i}∪B

by Lemma 4.12(iii) and the inductive assumption.
  Case 2: Say j − 1 ∈ A and j − 1 ∈ B. Set A1 := A\{j − 1} and B1 := B\{j − 1}.
Then A1 , B1 ⊆ (i..j − 1), |A1 | = |B1 |, and A1 ↓ B1 . If h = max([i..j − 1)\A) = i, then
by Lemma 4.12(iv) and the inductive assumption the left hand side of (4.13) is
                Ei · · · Ej−1 Si,j (A).vλ = Ei · · · Ej−2 Si,j−1 (A1 )bi,j−1 .vλ
                                          = bi,j−1 (λ)Ei · · · Ej−2 Si,j−1 (A1 ).vλ
                                                                            
                                                               Y
                                          = bi,j−1 (λ)ε             bi,t (λ) vλ
                                                              t∈{i}∪B1
                                                 Y
                                          =ε              bi,t (λ)vλ .
                                               t∈{i}∪B

On the other hand, if h > i, set A2 := A1 ∪ {h} and B2 := B1 ∪ {l}, where l :=
min((i..j)\B) (Note that l exists as h > i so A 6= (i..j) hence, since |A| = |B|, B 6=
(i..j)). Then A2 , B2 ⊆ (i..j − 1), |A2 | = |B2 |, and A2 ↓ B2 . Again, by Lemma 4.12(iv)
26                                        JONATHAN KUJAWA


and the inductive assumption the left hand side of (4.13) is
     Ei · · · Ej−1 Si,j (A).vλ = Ei · · · Ej−2 Si,j−1 (A1 )bh,j−1 .vλ + Ei · · · Ej−2 Si,j−1 (A2 ).vλ
                                                                 
                                                   Y                             Y
                               = bh,j−1 (λ)ε             bi,t (λ) vλ + ε′            bi,t (λ)vλ
                                                t∈{i}∪B1                    t∈{i}∪B2

However, h ∈ (i..j)\A so ci,h (λ) = 0, hence bh,j−1 (λ) = bi,j−1 (λ) − ci,h (λ) = bi,j−1 (λ).
Also, l ∈ (i..j)\B so bi,l (λ) = 0. Together, these yield
                                 Y
                           =ε         bi,t (λ)vλ
                                   t∈{i}∪B

Case 3: Say j − 1 ∈ A and j − 1 ∈  / B. Since j − 1 ∈
                                                    / B and |A| = |B|, we see that
h = max([i..j − 1)\A) 6= i. Note, too, that A\{j − 1} ∪ {h} ↓ B. Consequently, by
Lemma 4.12(iv) and the inductive assumption, the left hand side of (4.13) is
Ei · · · Ej−1 Si,j (A).vλ = Ei · · · Ej−2 Si,j−1 (A\{j − 1})bh,j−1 .vλ
                                               + Ei · · · Ej−2 Si,j−1 (A\{j − 1} ∪ {h}).vλ
                                                                                   Y
                            = bh,j−1 (λ)Ei · · · Ej−2 Si,j−1 (A\{j − 1}).vλ + ε          bi,t (λ)vλ
                                                                                    t∈{i}∪B

However, since h ∈ (i..j)\A and j − 1 ∈ (i..j)\B, we have bh,j−1 (λ) = bi,j−1 (λ) −
ci,h (λ) = 0. Therefore,
                           Y
                       =ε      bi,t (λ).
                                t∈{i}∪B

Therefore, under the assumptions given (4.13) always holds.                                             
Lemma 4.14. Let 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m + n, λ ∈ X(T ), and vλ ∈ M (λ)λ . Let C ⊆ Ci,j (λ)
and set A = (i..j)\C. If Si,j (A).vλ ∈
                                     / Rad M (λ), then Bi,j (λ) ↓ C.
Proof. We again induct on d(i, j) := |(i..j)|. If d(i, j) = 0, then A = C = ∅ and
j = i + 1. Consequently, we have
                         Si,j (A).vλ = Fi,i+1 .vλ = ei+1,i .vλ ∈
                                                               / Rad M (λ).
However, this implies we have
                                                                                       
          ei,i+1 ei+1,i .vλ = ei,i − (−1)vi +vi+1 ei+1,i+1 + (−1)vi +vi+1 ei+1,i ei,i+1 .vλ
                                                          
                            = ei,i − (−1)vi +vi+1 ei+1,i+1 .vλ
                           = (−1)vi bi,i .vλ
                           ∈
                           / Rad M (λ).
In particular, this implies bi,i .vλ 6= 0, hence bi,i (λ) 6= 0. Therefore Bi,j (λ) = ∅ and,
trivially, Bi,j (λ) ↓ C.
   Now assume d(i, j) > 0 and that the statement holds for all smaller d(i, j). First,
we observe that El Si,j (A).vλ ∈/ Rad M (λ) for some 1 ≤ l ≤ m + n − 1. Otherwise this
along with a weight argument implies Si,j (A).vλ ∈ Rad M (λ), a contradiction. Thus
we can choose an 1 ≤ l ≤ m + n − 1 with El Si,j (A).vλ ∈     / Rad M (λ). We now consider
the possibilities for l :
         CRYSTAL STRUCTURES ARISING FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF GL(m|n)                          27


  Case 1: l ∈ {i} ∪ A, l + 1 ∈
                             / A ∪ {j}. Then by Lemma 4.12(ii) we have
               El Si,j (A).vλ = −bSi,l (Ai..l )Sl+1,j (Al+1..j ).vλ ∈
                                                                    / Rad M (λ)
where b is as in the Lemma. However Si,l (Ai..l ) and Sl+1,j (Al+1..j ) commute so both
Si,l (Ai..l ).vλ ∈
                 / Rad M (λ) and Sl+1,j (Al+1..j ).vλ ∈
                                                      / Rad M (λ). By induction Bi,l (λ) ↓
Ci..l := (i..l)\Ai..l and Bl+1,j ↓ Cl+1..j := (l + 1..j)\Al+1..j . However, in the case
under consideration, l + 1 ∈ Ci,j (λ). That is, ci,l+1 (λ) = 0 so bi,l (λ) 6= 0, hence
l∈
 / Bi,j (λ). We also observe that Bl+1,j (λ) ⊆ Bi,j (λ) and Bi,l (λ) ⊆ Bi,j (λ). Thus we
have Bi,l (λ)∪Bl+1,j (λ) = Bi,j (λ) (with equality coming from the fact that l ∈
                                                                               / Bi,j (λ)).
However, C = Ci..l ∪ Cl+1..j ∪ {l + 1}. Therefore Bi,j (λ) ↓ C.
   Case 2: l = j − 1, l ∈  / {i} ∪ A. By Lemma 4.12(iii) we have
                        El Si,j (A).vλ = Si,j−1 (A).vλ ∈
                                                       / Rad M (λ).
By induction, we have Bi,j−1 (λ) ↓ Ci..j−1 := (i..j − 1)\A. But C = Ci..j−1 ∪ {j − 1}
and either Bi,j (λ) = Bi,j−1 (λ) or Bi,j (λ) = Bi,j−1 (λ) ∪ {j − 1}. In either case, the
weakly increasing injective map θ : Bi,j−1 (λ) ֒→ Ci..j−1 extends to a weakly increasing
injective map Bi,j (λ) ֒→ C. Therefore Bi,j (λ) ↓ C.
   Case 3: l = j − 1 ∈ A. Let h = max([i..l)\A). Then by Lemma 4.12 (iv)
   El Si,j (A).vλ = Si,j−1 (Ai..j−1 )bh,j−1 .vλ + (1 − δi,h )Si,j−1 (A\{j − 1} ∪ {h}).vλ .
Then necessarily either Si,j−1 (Ai..j−1 )bh,j−1 .vλ ∈
                                                    / Rad M (λ) or (1 − δi,h )Si,j−1 (A\{j −
1} ∪ {h}).vλ ∈ / Rad M (λ). If the former occurs, then by induction we have Bi,j−1 (λ) ↓
Ci..j−1 . As in Case 2, one concludes that Bi,j (λ) ↓ C. If the latter occurs, then h 6= i
and by induction Bi,j−1 (λ) ↓ C\{h}. Again one can extend any weakly increasing
injective map to prove that Bi,j (λ) ↓ C.
   All other possibilities are eliminated by Lemma 4.12 and our assumption that
El Si,j (A).vλ 6∈ Rad M (λ). This proves the desired result in all possible situations. 
4.4. Filtrations and Hom-spaces. By weights and Frobenious reciprocity, we have
the following lemma.
Lemma 4.15. Let λ, µ ∈ X(T ) and let W be a nonzero submodule of W (µ). Then
                           dimk HomDist(G) (M (λ), W ) = δλ,µ .
Corollary 4.16. Say M is a Dist(G)-supermodule with a filtration by co-Verma su-
permodules:
                      0 = M0 ⊆ M1 ⊆ M2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Mr = M
with Mi /Mi−1 isomorphic to W (µ(i) ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Then
                     dimk HomDist(G) (M (λ), M ) = |{i : µ(i) = λ}|.
Proof. We prove the theorem by inducting on r. The base case of r = 1 follows im-
mediately from Lemma 4.15. One proves the inductive step by applying the functor
HomDist(G) (M (λ), −) to the short exact sequence
                           0 → W (µ(1) ) → M → M/M1 → 0,
and Lemmas 3.5 and 4.15.                                                                     

Lemma 4.17. Let λ ∈ X(T ). Then we have the filtration
                     0 = M0 ⊆ M1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Mm+n = M (λ) ⊗ V ∗
of M (λ)⊗V ∗ with Mi /Mi−1 ∼ = M (λ−εm+n−i+1 ) for all i = 1, . . . , m+n. Furthermore,
if vλ is the canonical generator for M (λ), then the image of vλ ⊗ wm+n−i+1 is the
canonical generator of Mi /Mi−1 .
Proof. Let kλ be the Dist(B)-supermodule of highest weight λ ∈ X(T ), and let vλ de-
note its canonical generator. We have a filtration of kλ ⊗ V ∗ as a Dist(B)-supermodule
given by
                        0 = Q0 ⊆ Q1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Qm+n = kλ ⊗ V ∗ ,
where Qk is generated by vλ ⊗ wm+n , . . . , vλ ⊗ wm+n−k+1 . Let
                               Mk = Dist(G) ⊗Dist(B) Qk .
The result follows by exactness of the functor Dist(G) ⊗Dist(B) − and the super version

                                  (
                                          k,   if µ = λ − εi for some 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n;
     HomDist(G) (M (µ), W (λ) ⊗ V ∗ ) =
                                          0,   otherwise.
Proof. It follows from Lemma 4.17 and taking contravariant duals that we have the
filtration
                      0 = N0 ⊆ N1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Nm+n = W (λ) ⊗ V ∗                         (4.14)
               ∼
with Ni /Ni−1 = W (λ − εi ) for all i = 1, . . . , m + n. The result then follows by applying
Corollary 4.16.                                                                             
4.5. Return to Normal, Good, Conormal, and Cogood. We are now able to
provide representation theoretic interpretations of the combinatorial notions of normal,
good, conormal, and cogood. Note that the arguments used here are an adaptation of
those used in [2].
   Let V ′ denote the subspace of V spanned by the vectors v1 , . . . , vm+n−1 . We con-
sider G′ = GL(V ′ ) as a subgroup of G = GL(V ) in the natural way and make the
corresponding identification of Dist(G′ ) as a subalgebra of Dist(G). A direct calculation
verifies the following lemma.
Lemma 4.19. Let M be a Dist(G)-supermodule. Define the following linear map
                                  Pm+n−1
 e : M → M ⊗ V ∗ , x 7→ x ⊗ wm+n + h=1 (−1)(vh +x)(vh +v m+n ) Eh,m+n x ⊗ wh .
The map e is a homomorphism of Dist(G′ )-supermodules.
Theorem 4.20. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and let 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n. Let vλ ∈ M (λ)λ denote the
canonical generator of M (λ). The following are equivalent:
     (i) dimk HomDist(G) (M (λ − εi ), L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ ) = 1;
    (ii) Si,m+n (A).vλ ∈
                       / Rad M (λ), where A := (i..m + n)\Ci,m+n (λ);
   (iii) Bi,m+n (λ) ↓ Ci,m+n (λ) (i.e. i is normal for λ);
Proof. Say i = m + n. A consideration of weights shows that the image of vλ ⊗ wm+n ∈
L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ is a primitive vector. Consequently, by Frobenious reciprocity we have
HomDist(G) (M (λ − εm+n ), L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ ) 6= 0. When i = m + n it is straightforward to
verify that (ii) and (iii) also always hold. Therefore, for the rest of the proof we
assume 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n − 1.

   (i) ⇒ (ii) : Let ϕ : M (λ) → W (λ − εi ) ⊗ V be the non-zero homomorphism given
in Corollary 4.18. We can choose ϕ so that ϕ(vλ ) = w ⊗ vi , where w is the dual of the
canonical generator of M (λ − εi ). Observe that (i) holds if and only if Rad M (λ) ⊆
Ker ϕ. Suppose (ii) is false, then Si,m+n (A).vλ = Sei,m+n (A).vλ ∈ Rad M (λ). It
suffices to show Sei,n (A).vλ ∈
                              / Ker ϕ. As a vector space, we have the direct sum decom-

From the definition of Sei,m+n (A), one can verify that
                                             Y
ϕ(Sei,m+n (A).vλ ) = Sei,m+n (A).(w ⊗ vi ) =   c̃i,t Fi,m+n .(w ⊗ vi ) + (∗)

                                        Qi . In particular, the projection of ϕ(Si,m+n (A).vλ )
onto W (λ − εi ) ⊗ vm+n is precisely t∈A ci,t (λ)(w ⊗ vm+n ), which is nonzero by the
choice of A. Therefore ϕ(Sei,m+n (A).vλ ) 6= 0.
   (ii) ⇒ (iii) : This follows from Lemma 4.14.
   (iii) ⇒ (i) : Since Bi,m+n (λ) ↓ Ci,m+n (λ), then we can find a subset C ⊆ Ci,m+n (λ)
such that Bi,m+n (λ) ↓ C and |Bi,m+n (λ)| = |C|. Note that since Bi,m+n (λ) ↓
Ci,m+n (λ), we have i ∈     / Bi,m+n (λ). So, setting B = (i..m + n)\Bi,m+n (λ) and
A = (i..m + n)\C, we have A, B ⊆ (i..m + n), |A| = |B|, and A ↓ B. Consequently,
by Lemma 4.13, we have
                                                           Y
                    Ei · · · Em+n−1 Si,m+n (A).vλ = ε            bi,t (λ)vλ .

However, by the definition of B, the right hand side is a nonzero scalar multiple of
vλ . Therefore, z := Si,m+n (A).vλ ∈
                                   / Rad M (λ) and the image of z in L(λ) is nonzero.
Consequently z ⊗ wm+n ∈ L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ is nonzero and, hence,
                                 m+n−1
                                  X
  vλ (i) := e(z) = z ⊗ wm+n +           (−1)(vk +v i +vm+n )(v k +vm+n ) Ek,m+n z ⊗ wk (4.15)
                                  k=1
is nonzero.
                       (r)
   We now show El .z ∈ Rad M (λ) for all r ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ l ≤ m + n − 2. If r > 2
         (r)
then El .z = 0 by a weight argument. It remains to consider the case when r = 1 : If
l+1 ∈ A, or l ∈  / {i}∪A and l+1 ∈ / A, then El .z = 0 by Lemma 4.12(i). If l ∈ {i}∪A and
l+1 ∈  / A, then by Lemma 4.12(ii), El .z = −bSi,l (Ai..l )Sl+1..m+n (Al+1..m+n ).vλ . Since
Si,l (Ai..l ) and Sl+1,m+n (Al+1..m+n ) commute, it suffices to show either Si,l (Ai..l ).vλ ∈
Rad M (λ) or Sl+1,m+n (Al+1..m+n ).vλ ∈ Rad M (λ). First, however, observe that our
assumptions about l imply ci,l+1 (λ) = 0, so bi,l (λ) 6= 0, Cl+1..m+n ⊆ Cl+1,m+n (λ), and
Bi,m+n (λ) = Bi,l (λ) ∪ Bl+1,m+n (λ). Now suppose Si,l (Ai..l ).vλ ∈/ Rad M (λ). Then by
Lemma 4.14, Bi,l (λ) ↓ Ci..l and, hence, |Bi,l (λ)| ≤ |Ci..l |. Thus, |Bl+1,m+n (λ)| ≥
30                                   JONATHAN KUJAWA


|Cl..m+n |, so |Bl+1,m+n (λ)| > |Cl+1..m+n |. But this implies that Bl+1,m+n (λ) ↓
Cl+1..m+n is false. Therefore, Sl+1,m+n (Al+1..m+n ).vλ ∈ Rad M (λ) by Lemma 4.14.
   The preceding paragraph proves z ∈ L(λ) is a Dist(G′ ) primitive vector hence, by
Lemma 4.19, vλ (i) is a Dist(G′ ) primitive vector. Furthermore, observe that a weight
                                                      (r)
argument along with a direct calculation verifies Em+n−1 .vλ (i) = 0 for any r ≥ 1.
Therefore vλ (i) is in fact a Dist(G) primitive vector. By a routine application of
Frobenious reciprocity we obtain
                        HomDist(G) (M (λ − εi ), L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ ) 6= 0.
                                                                                        
   To continue, recall from subsection 4.1 the definitions of Ve , G
                                                                   e = GL(Ve ), and X(Te).
Let us write B e for the Borel subgroup of G
                                           e of upper triangular matrices, L(λ)
                                                                              e    for the
                   e                                          e
irreducible Dist(G)-supermodule of highest weight λ ∈ X(T ), etc.
   Let S̃ : Dist(G) → Dist(G)e be the even superalgebra isomorphism given by
                             S̃(ei,j ) = −(−1)vi (vi +v j ) ew0 j,w0 i              (4.16)
for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m + n, where w0 ∈ Sm+n is the longest element. Given a Dist(G)-   e
supermodule, M, we can twist it by S̃ to obtain a Dist(G)-supermodule. Namely, M =
M as a superspace with action given by x.m = S̃(x)m for all x ∈ Dist(G) and all m ∈
M. We denote the resultant Dist(G)-supermodule by M S̃ . Since S̃(Dist(T )) = Dist(Te),
the weight space decomposition of M is preserved. In fact, since ei,i 7→ −ew0 i,w0 i for
all 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n, we have
                                     Ms̃(λ) = (M S̃ )λ
for all λ ∈ X(T ), where the map s̃ : X(T ) → X(Te) is as defined in (4.5). Furthermore,
                           e twisting by S̃ preserves primitive vectors. Consequently
since S̃(Dist(B)) = Dist(B),
we have
                     f(s̃(λ))S̃ ∼
                     M          = M (λ) and L(s̃(λ))  e   S̃ ∼ L(λ).
                                                             =
In particular, we have that
                                       (Ve ∗ )S̃ ∼
                                                 = V.
                         e
Note that for any Dist(G)-supermodules M and N we have
                                 (M ⊗ N )S̃ ∼
                                            = M S̃ ⊗ N S̃ .
Corollary 4.21. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and let 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n. Then i is conormal for λ if
and only if
                  dimk HomDist(G) (M (λ + εi ), L(λ) ⊗ V ) = 1.
Proof. By Lemma 4.9, i is conormal for λ ∈ X(T ) if and only if w0 i is normal for
s̃(λ) ∈ X(T̃ ). By the above remarks we have the following isomorphisms of Hom-
spaces:
               Hom        f                   e          e∗
                       e (M (s̃(λ) − εw0 i ), L(s̃(λ)) ⊗ V )
                   Dist(G)
                       ∼             f(s̃(λ) − εw0 i )S̃ , (L(s̃(λ))
                       = HomDist(G) (M                      e        ⊗ Ve ∗ )S̃ )

                       = HomDist(G) (M (λ + εi ), L(λ) ⊗ V ).
The result then follows immediately from Theorem 4.20.                                  

Corollary 4.22. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n. Then i is good for λ if and only if
                       dimk HomDist(G) (L(λ − εi ), L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ ) = 1.                   (4.17)
Proof. By Lemma 4.8, it suffices to show (4.17) holds if and only if i is normal for
λ and conormal for λ − εi . That is, by Theorem 4.20 and Corollary 4.21, that (4.17)
holds if and only if
                         HomDist(G) (M (λ − εi ), L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ ) 6= 0                     (4.18)
                         HomDist(G) (L(λ − εi ), W (λ) ⊗ V ∗ ) 6= 0.
   The Hom-space given in (4.17) is naturally a subspace of the Hom-spaces in (4.18).
Hence, if (4.17) holds, then (4.18) holds. Conversely, assume (4.18) holds. By Corol-
lary 4.18 we have that
                           HomDist(G) (M (λ − εi ), W (λ) ⊗ V ∗ )
is exactly one dimensional. Choose a nonzero homomorphism f : M (λ − εi ) → W (λ) ⊗
V ∗ . Since (4.18) holds, we have f (M (λ − εi )) ⊆ L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ and Ker f ⊆ Rad M (λ − εi ).
Consequently, the map f factors through to give a nonzero f˜ : L(λ − εi ) → L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ .
This implies the desired result.                                                        
   Arguing as in the proof of Corollary 4.21 using the map S̃ one obtains the following
corollary of the previous result.
Corollary 4.23. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n. Then i is cogood for λ if and only if
                       dimk HomDist(G) (L(λ + εi ), L(λ) ⊗ V ) = 1.                     (4.19)

                               5. Translation Functors
5.1. Translation Functors and Irreducible Supermodules. Recall from (2.16)
the definition of the translation functors Er and Fr for r ∈ Z/pZ. We can now describe
how these functors act on irreducible Dist(G)-supermodules.
Lemma 5.1. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and r ∈ Z/pZ. Then there is a filtration
                               0 = Q0 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Ql = Er L(λ)
with Qk /Qk−1 a nonzero submodule of W (λ − εik ) and where i1 < · · · < il and
{i1 , . . . , il } = {i : 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n, i is r-normal for λ}.
Proof. First, let µ ∈ X(T ). We observe that by Theorem 4.20
                              HomDist(G) (M (µ), Er L(λ)) 6= 0                           (5.1)
if and only if µ = λ − εi for some 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n which is normal for λ and wt(λ − εi ) =
wt(λ) + γr − γr+1 . However, wt(λ − εi ) = wt(λ) − (−1)v i γ(λ+ρ,εi ) + (−1)vi γ(λ+ρ−εi ,εi ) .
From this we conclude that (5.1) holds if and only if µ = λ − εi for some 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n
which is r-normal for λ.
    Recall from (4.14) the filtration of W (λ) ⊗ V ∗ by co-Verma supermodules. Inter-
secting with L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ and projecting onto Er L(λ), we obtain a filtration
                             0 = Q0 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Qm+n = Er L(λ)
of Er L(λ) where each Qk /Qk−1 is a (possibly zero) submodule of a co-Verma module.
Refining this filtration by requiring strict inclusions, we obtain
                               0 = Q0 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Ql = Er L(λ)

with Qk /Qk−1 a nonzero submodule of W (λ − εik ) and i1 < · · · < il .
  Now for any µ ∈ X(T ) we have,
                                              l
                                              X
        dimk HomDist(G) (M (µ), Er L(λ)) ≤          dimk HomDist(G) (M (µ), Qk /Qk−1 ).
                                              k=1
   If 1 ≤ t ≤ m + n is r-normal for λ, then the left hand side is nonzero for µ = λ − εt .
However, by Lemma 4.15, the right hand side is one if µ = λ − εik for some k = 1, . . . , l
and zero otherwise. Consequently, t = ik for some 1 ≤ k ≤ l. On the other hand,
assume Qk /Qk−1 is nonzero. Applying the functor HomDist(G) (M (λ − εik ), −) to the
short exact sequence
                           0 → Qk−1 → Qk → Qk /Qk−1 → 0
we obtain the long exact sequence
     0 → HomDist(G) (M (λ − εik ), Qk−1 ) → HomDist(G) (M (λ − εik ), Qk ) →
         → HomDist(G) (M (λ − εik ), Qk /Qk−1 ) → Ext1Dist(G) (M (λ − εik ), Qk−1 ) → . . .
By weights we have HomDist(G) (M (λ − εik ), Qk−1 ) = 0 and by Lemma 3.5 we have
Ext1Dist(G) (M (λ − εik ), Qk−1 ) = 0. Consequently, by Lemma 4.15,

hence ik is r-normal for λ.                                                                   
Theorem 5.2. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and r ∈ Z/pZ.
   (i) Er L(λ) 6= 0 if and only if ε∗r (λ) 6= 0, in which case it is a self-dual indecompos-
       able module with irreducible socle and cosocle both isomorphic to L(µ) where
       µ = ẽ∗r (λ). Moreover, Er L(λ) is irreducible if and only if ε∗r (λ) = 1.
  (ii) Fr L(λ) 6= 0 if and only if ϕ∗r (λ) 6= 0, in which case it is a self-dual indecompos-
       able module with irreducible socle and cosocle both isomorphic to L(µ) where
       µ = f˜r∗ (λ). Moreover, Fr L(λ) is irreducible if and only if ϕ∗r (λ) = 1.
Proof. First we prove (i). Using Corollary 4.22 and arguing as in the proof of the
previous lemma, we have
                               HomDist(G) (L(µ), Er L(λ)) 6= 0
holds if and only if µ = λ − εi for some 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n which is r-good for λ. Also we
note that if i is r-good for λ, then it is necessarily unique by the definition of r-good.
    From this we see that if Er L(λ) 6= 0, then the socle of Er (λ) is precisely L(λ − εi ) ∼=
L(ẽ∗r (λ)) where i is r-good for λ. Therefore, Er L(λ) 6= 0 if and only if ε∗r (λ) 6= 0 and, if
it is nonzero, it has irreducible socle and is indecomposable. The self-duality statement
and, hence, the description of the head follows from the fact that L(λ) is self-dual with
respect to contravariant duality and Er commutes with this duality.
    Finally, we prove the statement about the simplicity of Er L(λ). If Er L(λ) is simple,
it is clear that i is r-normal if and only if i is r-good. Consequently, ε∗r (λ) = 1. One the
other hand, assume ε∗r (λ) = 1 but Er L(λ) is not irreducible. Fix i to be the position
of the unique − in the reduced r-signature for λ. From Lemma 5.1 we deduce that
Er L(λ) is a submodule of W (λ − εi ). This implies by the reducibility assumption that
           CRYSTAL STRUCTURES ARISING FROM REPRESENTATIONS OF GL(m|n)                            33


HomDist(G) (Er L(λ), L(λ − εi )) = 0. However, taking contravariant duals and using
that i is r-good for λ, we see that
         HomDist(G) (Er L(λ), L(λ − εi )) ∼
                                          = HomDist(G) (L(λ − εi ), Er L(λ)) 6= 0.
This gives the desired contradiction. Therefore Er L(λ) is irreducible.
   One deduces (ii) from (i) using the map S̃ defined in (4.16) or can be proven directly
with an argument similar to the one used above.                                        
   Since
                          L                                               L
           L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ =     r∈Z/pZ   Er L(λ)      and        L(λ) ⊗ V =       r∈Z/pZ   Fr L(λ)
are decompositions into indecomposable summands we obtain the following corollaries.
Corollary 5.3. Let λ ∈ X(T ). Then,
   (i) The socle of L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ is precisely
                                   M
                                                        L(λ − εi ).
                                        1≤i≤m+n
                                      i is good for λ

    (ii) The socle of L(λ) ⊗ V is precisely
                                     M
                                                         L(λ + εi ).
                                         1≤i≤m+n
                                     i is cogood for λ

In particular, in both cases the socle is multiplicity free and contains no more than p
irreducible summands.
Corollary 5.4. Let λ ∈ X(T ). Then,
   (i) L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ is semisimple if and only if every 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n which is normal is
       good. That is, if and only if ε∗r (λ) ≤ 1 for every r ∈ Z/pZ.
  (ii) L(λ) ⊗ V is semisimple if and only if every 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n which is conormal
       is cogood. That is, if and only if ϕ∗r (λ) ≤ 1 for every r ∈ Z/pZ.

                                     6. Odd Reflections
     The results of this article depend on our choice of a homogeneous basis for V.
More precisely, the crystal structure on X(T ) depends on the sequence of parities,
v 1 , . . . , v m+n , of the vectors we have chosen. In this section, we discuss how to translate
from one choice to another using Serganova’s odd reflections. Note that it suffices to
determine how to translate from the fixed homogeneous basis v1 , . . . , vm+n to the
homogeneous basis v1 , . . . , vi−1 , vi+1 , vi , vi+2 , . . . , vm+n when v i + v i+1 = 1̄ for some
1 ≤ i ≤ m + n − 1. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n − 1 and let σi : V → V denote the linear map
defined by sending the first basis to the second. That is,
                                         σi (vj ) = v(i i+1)j ,
for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m + n and where (i i + 1) ∈ Sm+n . We then have an automorphism on
GL(V ) induced by σi which in turn induces an automorphism si : Dist(G) → Dist(G).
Explicitly,
                             si : ek,l 7→ e(i i+1)k,(i i+1)l                  (6.1)
for all 1 ≤ k, l ≤ m + n. We can twist a Dist(G)-supermodule M by si in the usual
way, where M si = M as a superspace and a.m = si (a)m for all a ∈ Dist(G) and all
m ∈ M. In particular, L(λ)si is again an irreducible Dist(G)-supermodule of some

highest weight. The following lemma allows us to determine the highest weight of
L(λ)si .
   Recall that Sm+n acts on X(T ) via x · εj = εxj for x ∈ Sm+n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m + n.
For 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n − 1, let si : X(T ) → X(T ) be the involution given by
                    (
                      (i i + 1) · λ,              if (λ, εi − εi+1 ) ≡ 0 (mod p);
           si (λ) =                                                                (6.2)
                      (i i + 1) · λ − εi+1 + εi , if (λ, εi − εi+1 ) 6≡ 0 (mod p);
where (−, −) is the bilinear form on X(T ) defined in (2.2).
Lemma 6.1. Let λ ∈ X(T ) and let 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n − 1 satisfying v i + v i+1 = 1̄. Then,
                              L(λ)si ∼
                                     = L(si (λ))
Proof. We observe that by the action of si on Dist(T ), if v ∈ L(λ)µ , then v ∈
(L(λ)si )(i i+1)·µ . Now let vλ be a Dist(G) primitive vector in L(λ) of weight λ, c.f.
Lemma 2.2. We observe that the vector ei,i+1 .vλ = ei+1,i vλ ∈ L(λ)si is a Dist(G)
primitive vector. For if 1 ≤ r < s ≤ m + n, then, unless r = i and s = i + 1, it
is straightforward to verify that er,s .ei+1,i vλ = 0 by the action of si and by (2.4).
The final case to check is ei,i+1 .ei+1,i vλ . However, ei,i+1 .ei+1,i vλ = e2i+1,i vλ and since
ei+1,i = v i + v i+1 = 1̄, e2i+1,i = 0 and so the result follows in this case as well.
   Now suppose that ei+1,i vλ 6= 0. We get from the previous paragraph that ei+1,i v ∈
L(λ)si is Dist(G) primitive of weight (i i + 1) · (λ − εi + εi+1 ) = (i i + 1) · λ − εi+1 + εi .
Hence, L(λ)si ∼    = L((i i + 1) · λ − εi+1 + εi ). On the other hand, if ei+1,i vλ = 0,
then vλ ∈ L(λ)si is itself already a Dist(G) primitive vector of weight (i i + 1) · λ so
L(λ)si ∼= L((i i + 1) · λ).
   Thus, to complete the proof of the lemma, it suffices to show that ei+1,i vλ 6= 0 if and
only if (λ, εi − εi+1 ) 6≡ 0 (mod p). But ei+1,i vλ 6= 0 if and only if there is some element
x ∈ Dist(B) such that xei+1,i vλ is a non-zero multiple of vλ . By weights, the only x
that needs to be considered is ei,i+1 . Finally, ei,i+1 ei+1,i vλ = (−1)vi (λ, εi −εi+1 )vλ . 
   This result is closely related to the fact that G has non-conjugate Borel subgroups
and, hence, different labelings of the irreducible Dist(G)-supermodules by highest
weight. The problem of translating between labelings was first solved by Serganova
[19] and is also discussed in [4].
Corollary 6.2. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n with v i + v i+1 = 1̄. Let X(T )1 denote X(T ) with
the crystal structure lifted (as in subsection 2.7) from the crystal
                                                                                        
                 Bv1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Bvi ⊗ Bvi+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Bvm+n , ẽ∗r , f˜r∗ , ε∗r , ϕ∗r , wt ,
and let X(T )2 denote X(T ) with the crystal structure lifted from the crystal
                                                                                      
               Bv1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Bvi+1 ⊗ Bvi ⊗ · · · ⊗ Bvm+n , ẽ∗r , f˜r∗ , ε∗r , ϕ∗r , wt .
The map
                                 si : X(T )1 → X(T )2
defined in (6.1) gives an isomorphism of crystals.
Proof. We first prove that wt(si (λ)) = wt(λ). However, in both cases (when (λ, εi −
εi+1 ) ≡ 0(mod p) and when (λ, εi −εi+1 ) 6≡ 0(mod p)) this follows from straightforward
arguments using the definition of the function wt and a careful consideration of the
parities involved.

  We next prove that si (ẽ∗r (λ)) = ẽ∗r (si (λ)) for all λ ∈ X(T ) and all r ∈ Z/pZ. We first
prove that ẽ∗r (λ) 6= 0 if and only if ẽ∗r (si (λ)) 6= 0. If ẽ∗r (λ) 6= 0, then by Theorem 2.4
wt(ẽ∗r (λ)) = wt(λ) + γr − γr+1 and, twisting by si and applying Lemma 6.1,
                        0 6= HomDist(G) (L(ẽ∗r (λ)), L(λ) ⊗ V ∗ )
                          ∼
                          = HomDist(G) (L(ẽ∗ (λ))si , L(λ)si ⊗ (V ∗ )si )
                                               r
                          ∼
                          = HomDist(G) (L(si (ẽ∗r (λ))), L(si (λ)) ⊗ V ∗ ).
By the previous paragraph we have wt(si (ẽ∗r (λ))) = wt(si (λ)) + γr − γr+1 . By Theo-
rem 2.4 again, we have
                        HomDist(G) (L(ẽ∗r (si (λ))), L(si (λ)) ⊗ V ∗ ) 6= 0.
Thus, ẽ∗r (si (λ)) 6= 0. The converse is proven by in an identical manner. We next observe
that if ẽ∗r (si (λ)) 6= 0, then it is completely determined by the fact that it satisfies the
following two properties:
     (1) HomDist(G) (L(ẽ∗r (si (λ))), L(si (λ)) ⊗ V ∗ ) 6= 0,
     (2) wt(ẽ∗r (si (λ))) = wt(si (λ)) + γr − γr+1 .
Consequently, by our earlier observations we have si (ẽ∗r (λ)) = ẽ∗r (si (λ)).
   A similar argument proves si (f˜r∗ (λ)) = f˜r∗ (si (λ)) for all λ ∈ X(T ) and all r ∈ Z/pZ.
This proves the desired result.                                                             
   One can also give a purely combinatorial proof of this result.
