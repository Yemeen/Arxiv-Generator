                                             Abstract. This paper introduces the notion of calibrated representations for affine Hecke algebras
                                             and classifies and constructs all finite dimensional irreducible calibrated representations. The
                                             main results are that (1) irreducible calibrated representations are indexed by placed skew shapes,
                                             (2) the dimension of an irreducible calibrated representation is the number of standard Young
                                             tableaux corresponding to the placed skew shape and (3) each irreducible calibrated representation
                                             is constructed explicitly by formulas which describe the action of each generator of the affine Hecke
                                             algebra on a specific basis in the representation space. This construction is a generalization of A.
                                             Young’s seminormal construction of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group. In this
                                             sense Young’s construction has been generalized to arbitrary Lie type.

                                             0. Introduction
                                                  The affine Hecke algebra was introduced by Iwahori and Matsumoto [IM] as a tool for studying
                                             the representations of a p-adic Lie group. In some sense, all irreducible principal series representa-
                                             tions of the p-adic group can be determined by classifying the representations of the corresponding
                                             affine Hecke algebra. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to determine the irreducible representations
                                             of the affine Hecke algebra.
                                                  Kazhdan and Lusztig [KL] (see also the important work of Ginzburg [CG]) gave a geometric
                                             classification of the irreducible representations of the affine Hecke algebra. This classification is a
                                             q-analogue of Springer’s construction of the irreducible representations of the Weyl group on the
                                             cohomology of unipotent varieties. In the q-case, K-theory takes the place of cohomology and the
                                             irreducible representations of the affine Hecke algebra are constructed as quotients of the K-theory
                                             of special subvarieties of the flag variety. Although the classification of Kazhdan and Lusztig is
                                             an incredible tour-de-force it is difficult to obtain combinatorial information from this geometric
                                             construction. For example, it is difficult to determine the dimensions of the irreducible modules.
                                                  In this paper I give a new construction of a large family of irreducible modules of the affine
                                             Hecke algebra. The basis vectors are labeled by generalized standard Young tableaux and the action
                                             of each generator on each basis element is given explicitly. This construction is a generalization
                                             of Young’s seminormal construction of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group. In
                                             order to obtain this generalization I have had to generalize the concept of standard Young tableaux
                                             to arbitrary Lie type.
                                                  The modules which I construct I have termed “calibrated” modules. Specifically, a calibrated
                                             module is a module which has a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors for all the elements of a large
                                                  ∗

commutative algebra inside the affine Hecke algebra. This is analogous to the situation which occurs
for representations of complex semisimple Lie algebras where every finite dimensional module is a
direct sum of its weight spaces. In contrast to the complex semisimple Lie algebra case, it is never
true that all irreducible representations of the affine Hecke algebra are calibrated.
     The irreducible really calibrated modules for the affine Hecke algebra are indexed by placed
skew shapes, where “placed skew shape” is a generalization of the usual skew shape from com-
binatorial representation theory and symmetric function theory. As is to be expected, these new
generalized skew shapes and standard Young tableaux reduce to the classical objects in the Type
A case. This reduction is given in [Ra2].

Remarks on the results in this paper
     (1) It is quite a surprise that the seminormal construction of A. Young fits so nicely into
general Lie type. Up to now, the general feeling has been that Young’s results are very special
to the symmetric group and the Type A case. The direct generalization of Young’s seminormal
construction to arbitrary Lie type which is obtained in this paper shows that this is not the case
at all. The results of [Ra4] indicate how Young’s natural basis can also be generalized to arbitrary
Lie type.
     The seminormal representations of A. Young have been previously generalized to Iwahori-
Hecke algebras of Type A by Hoefsmit [H] and Wenzl [Wz] independently, to Iwahori-Hecke algebras
of types B and D by Hoefsmit [H] and to the cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,1,n by Ariki and Koike
[AK]. All of these generalizations use classical standard Young tableaux and similar formulas for
the action of the generators of the Hecke algebra. Using certain surjective homomorphisms [A]
from the affine Hecke algebras of type A to the algebras Hr,1,n one can easily show that these
earlier constructions are type A special cases of the general type construction given in this paper.
     In a previous paper [Ra1] I gave a method for generalizing Young’s theory of seminormal
representations to general Lie type. I now believe that this earlier idea was not the “proper” way
to proceed. The method here is much more natural and yields a cleaner and more beautiful theory.
Young’s classical formulas for the seminormal representations of the symmetric group Sn work in
general Lie type with no change at all!! The only previously missing ingredient was a good general
type definition of standard Young tableaux.
     (2) In the classical theory of representations of the symmetric group Sn the “skew shape
representations” are particularly well behaved Sn -modules. On the other hand there never seemed
to be any a priori raison d’etre for skew shape representations via which one could generalize this
concept to Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke algebras of other Lie types. The results in this paper
show that skew shape representations do arise in a perfectly natural way. They correspond to
irreducible representations of affine Hecke algebras. In the type A cases one recovers the classical
skew shape representations by restricting to the Iwahori-Hecke algebra inside the affine Hecke
algebra.
     (3) The two main techniques used in this paper are generalizations of the techniques of Mat-
sumoto [Ma] and Rodier [Ro]. In particular, the τ -operators and the calibration graphs Γ(t)
introduced in Section 2 are generalizations of the intertwining operators of Matsumoto and of the
graphs used by Rodier, respectively. I have changed the role of the intertwining operators by
having them be “left” operators instead of “right” operators. This means that they are no longer
intertwining but there are other benefits to using these operators in this fashion.
     (4) Heckman and Opdam [HO1-2] introduced a new “harmonic analysis” approach to the
representations of the affine Hecke algebra. In their work they also used the sets Z(t) and P (t)
which we use in section 3. These sets arise naturally in their work as the zeros and poles of
a certain Harish-Chandra c-function. In this paper these sets describe the behaviour of the τ -
                                        Calibrated representations                                   3

operators mentioned in remark (3). This means that there is a strong connection between the
c-function and these operators. The approach of Heckman-Opdam becomes difficult when one
needs to compute the residues of the c-function at certain singular points. In some cases these
difficulties can be surmounted by using the methods of this paper.
      (5) The Kazhdan-Lusztig construction of the irreducible representations of the affine Hecke
algebras shows that the structure of these representations is intimately connected with the geometry
of certain subvarieties Bs,u of the flag variety. It is my hope that the methods which I have used here
for studying representations of affine Hecke algebras, which are mostly combinatorial in nature, will
be useful for studying the geometry of the Bs,u varieties used in the Kazhdan-Lusztig construction.
I am hoping that the standard Young tableaux introduced here can be used as index sets for the
connected components of these varieties.

Acknowledgements
     This paper is the first in a series [Ra2-4] [RR1-2] on representations of affine Hecke algebras. I
have benefited from conversations with many people. To choose only a few, there were discussions
with S. Fomin, F. Knop, L. Solomon, M. Vazirani and N. Wallach which played an important role
in my progress. There were several times when I tapped into J. Stembridge’s fountain of useful
knowledge about root systems. D.-N. Verma helped at a crucial juncture by suggesting that I look
at the paper of Steinberg. G. Benkart was a very patient listener on many occasions. H. Barcelo, P.
Deligne, T. Halverson, R. Macpherson and R. Simion all gave large amounts of time to let me tell
them my story and every one of these sessions was helpful to me in solidifying my understanding.
     I single out Jacqui Ramagge with special thanks for everything she has done to help with
this project: from the most mundane typing and picture drawing to deep intense mathematical
conversations which helped to sort out many pieces of this theory. Her immense contribution is
evident in that some of the papers in this series on representations of affine Hecke algebras are
joint papers.
     A portion of this research was done during a semester stay at Mathematical Sciences Research
Institute where I was supported by a Postdoctoral Fellowship. I thank MSRI and National Science

1. The affine Hecke algebra

      Let R be a reduced irreducible root system in Rn , fix a set of positive roots R+ and let
{α1 , . . . , αn } be the corresponding simple roots in R. Let W be the Weyl group corresponding to
R. Let si denote the simple reflection in W corresponding to the simple root αi and recall that W
can be presented by generators s1 , s2 , . . . , sn and relations

                                 s2i           =          1,           for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
                            si sj si · · ·     =    sj si sj · · · ,     for i 6= j,

where mij = hαi , α∨         ∨

    Fix q ∈ C∗ such that q is not a root of unity. The Iwahori-Hecke algebra H is the associative
algebra over C defined by generators T1 , T2 , . . . , Tn and relations

                          Ti2                = (q − q −1 )Ti + 1,        for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,

where mij are the same as in the presentation of W . For w ∈ W define Tw = Ti1 · · · Tip where
si1 · · · sip = w is a reduced expression for w. By [Bou, Ch. IV §2 Ex. 23], the element Tw does
not depend on the choice of the reduced expression. The algebra H has dimension |W | and the
set {Tw }w∈W is a basis of H.
       The fundamental weights are the elements ω1 , . . . , ωn of Rn given by
                                                                          2αi
                              hωi , α∨
                                     j i = δij ,       where α∨
                                                              i =
                                                                        hαi , αi i
and δij is the Kronecker delta. The weight lattice is the W -invariant lattice in Rn given by
                                                       n
                                                       X
                                                 P =         Zωi .
                                                       i=1

Let X be the abelian group P except written multiplicatively. In other words,

               X = {X λ | λ ∈ P },      and X λ X µ = X λ+µ = X µ X λ ,              for λ, µ ∈ P .

Let C[X] denote the group algebra of X. There is a W -action on X given by

                                wX λ = X wλ            for w ∈ W , X λ ∈ X,

which we extend linearly to a W -action on C[X].
    The affine Hecke algebra H̃ associated to R and P is the algebra given by

                                H̃ = C-span{Tw X λ | w ∈ W, X λ ∈ X}

where the multiplication of the Tw is as in the Iwahori-Hecke algebra H, the multiplication of the
X λ is as in C[X] and we impose the relation

                                                X λ − X si λ
             X λ Ti = Ti X si λ + (q − q −1 )                ,       for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and X λ ∈ X.       (1.2)
                                                1 − X −αi

This formulation of the definition of H̃ is due to Lusztig [Lu2] following work of Bernstein and
Zelevinsky. The elements Tw X λ , w ∈ W , X λ ∈ X, form a basis of H̃.

Theorem 1.3. (Bernstein, Zelevinsky, Lusztig [Lu1, 8.1]) The center of H̃ is C[X]W = {f ∈
C[X] | wf = f }.


2. Weight spaces and calibration graphs

Weights

    Let
                              T = {group homomorphisms t: X → C∗ }.
                                                                                             −1
The torus T is an abelian group with a W -action given by (wt)(X λ ) = t(X w λ ). Any element
t ∈ T is determined by the values t(X ω1 ), t(X ω2 ), . . . , t(X ωn ). For any element t ∈ T define the
polar decomposition

                t = tr tc ,     tr , tc ∈ T such that tr (X λ ) ∈ R>0 , and |tc (X λ )| = 1,
                                      Calibrated representations                                          5

for all X λ ∈ X. There is a unique µ ∈ Rn and a unique ν ∈ Rn /P such that

                 tr (X λ ) = ehµ,λi       and    tc (X λ ) = e2πihν,λi ,         for all λ ∈ P .       (2.1)

In this way we identify the sets Tr = {t ∈ T | t = tr } and Tc = {t ∈ T | t = tc } with Rn and Rn /P ,
respectively.


Weight spaces
    Let M be a finite dimensional H̃-module. For each t ∈ T the t-weight space of M and the
generalized t-weight space are the subspaces

            Mt = {m ∈ M | X λ m = t(X λ )m for all X λ ∈ X}                    and


          Mtgen = {m ∈ M | for each X λ ∈ X, (X λ − t(X λ ))k m = 0 for some k ∈ Z>0 },
                                                                 L
respectively. If Mtgen 6= 0 then Mt 6= 0. In general M 6=            t∈T   Mt , but we do have
                                                     M
                                                M=         Mtgen .
                                                     t∈T


This is a decomposition of M into Jordan blocks for the action of C[X]. Define the support of M
to be
                                supp(M ) = {t ∈ T | Mtgen 6= 0}.                           (2.2)


Principal series modules
     Let t ∈ T and let Cvt be the one dimensional C[X]-module corresponding to the character
t: X → C∗ . Specifically, Cvt is the one dimensional vector space with basis {vt } and C[X]-action
given by
                                X λ vt = t(X λ )vt , for all X λ ∈ X.
The principal series representation corresponding to t is

                                           M (t) = H̃ ⊗C[X] Cvt .                                      (2.3)

The set {Tw ⊗ vt | w ∈ W } is a basis for the H̃-module M (t) and dim(M (t)) = |W |.
    If w ∈ W and X λ ∈ X then the defining relation (1.2) for H̃ implies that
                                                                     X
                         X λ (Tw ⊗ vt ) = t(X wλ )(Tw ⊗ vt ) +             au (Tu ⊗ vt ),

Theorem 2.5. (Kato’s irreducibility criterion [Ka]) Let t ∈ T and define P (t) = {α > 0 | t(X α ) =
q ±2 }. The principal series module M (t) is irreducible if and only if P (t) = ∅.


Remark. Kato actually proves a more general result and thus needs a further condition for
irreducibility. We have simplified matters by specifying the weight lattice P in our construction of
the affine Hecke algebra. One can use any W -invariant lattice in Rn and Kato works in this more
general situation. When the one uses the weight lattice P , a result of Steinberg [St, 4.2, 5.3] says
that the stabilizer Wt of a point t ∈ T under the action of W is always a reflection group. Because
of this Kato’s criterion takes a simpler form.

Irreducible modules


Proposition 2.6. Let M be a finite dimensional H̃-module.
(a) For some t ∈ T , Mt is nonzero.
(b) If M is irreducible and Mt 6= 0 then M is a quotient of M (t).
(c) If M is irreducible then dim(M ) ≤ |W |.

Proof. (a) As an X(T )-module M contains a simple submodule and this submodule must be one-
dimensional since all irreducible representations of a commutative algebra are one-dimensional.
Thus, there is a nonzero weight vector in M .
(b) Let mt be a nonzero vector in Mt . Then there is a unique H̃-module homomorphism determined
by
                                        φ: M (t) −→ M
                                             vt     7−→ mt
where vt is as in the construction of M (t) in (2.3) This map is surjective since M is irreducible.
Thus M is a quotient of M (t).
(c) follows from (b) since dim(M (t)) = |W |.

It follows from Proposition (2.6b) and (2.4) that the support supp(M ) of an irreducible H̃-module
M is contained in a single Weyl group orbit in T . Since M is irreducible and H̃ has countable
dimension, Dixmier’s version of Schur’s lemma implies that Z(H̃) acts on M by scalars. Let t ∈ T
be such that
                                pM = t(p)M,        for all p ∈ Z(H̃).
Since Z(H̃) = C[X(T )]W it follows that t(p(X)) = (wt)(p(X)) for all w ∈ W . The W -orbit W t of
t is the central character of M . We shall often abuse notation and refer to any weight s ∈ W t as
“the central character” of M .
Remarks.
(a) The algebra C[X]W is the polynomial ring

                                       C[X]W = C[χω1 , . . . , χωn ],

    where ω1 , . . . , ωn are the fundamental weights in P and χω1 , . . . , χωn , are the corresponding
    Weyl characters. Thus, in order to specify the W -orbit of a weight t ∈ T it is sufficient to
    specify the n complex numbers t(χω1 ), t(χω2 ), . . . , t(χωn ).

(b) If t ∈ T is real, i.e. t = tr , then every element of W t is also real. Then there is a unique
    dominant γ ∈ Rn such that the element s ∈ T given by
                                     s(X λ ) = ehγ,λi ,          for all λ ∈ P ,
    is in W t and this element is a canonical representative of the W -orbit W t. In this way the
    dominant elements of Rn index the real central characters.

The τ operators
     The maps τi : Mtgen → Msgen   it
                                      defined below are local operators on M in the sense that they
                               gen
act on each weight space Mt of M separately. The operator τi is only defined on weight spaces
Mtgen such that t(X αi ) 6= 1.

Proposition 2.7. Let t ∈ T such that t(X αi ) =6 1 and let M be a finite dimensional H̃-module.

(e) Let 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n and let mij be as in (1.1). Then

    whenever both sides are well defined operators on Mtgen .

Proof. (a) Note that (q − q −1 )/(1 − X −αi ) is not a well defined element of H̃ or C[X] since it is
not a polynomial in X −αi . Because of this we will be careful to view (q − q −1 )/(1 − X −αi ) only
as a local operator. Let us describe this operator more precisely.
     The element X αi acts on Mtgen by t(X αi ) times a unipotent transformation. As an operator
on Mtgen , 1 − X −αi is invertible since it has determinant (1 − t(X −αi ))d where d = dim(Mtgen ).
Since this determinant is nonzero (q − q −1 )/(1 − X −αi ) = (q − q −1 )(1 − X −αi )−1 is a well defined
operator on Mtgen . Thus the definition of of τi makes sense.
     The following calculation shows that τi maps Mtgen into Msgen      it
                                                                           . For the purposes of this
calculation we are viewing all elements of C[X] as local operators on Mtgen and we abuse notation
and denote the operator (1 − X −αi )−1 by 1/(1 − X −αi ). We are able to do this without any
problems because C[X] is commutative.

(d) The operator X αi acts on Mtgen as t(X αi ) times a unipotent transformation. Similarly for X −αi .
Thus, as an operator on Mtgen det((q − q −1 X αi )(q − q −1 X −αi )) = 0 if and only if t(X αi ) = q ±2 .
Thus part (c) implies that τi τi is invertible if and only if t(X αi ) 6= q ±2 . The statement follows.
(e) Let us begin with a slight diversion which will be helpful in the proof. Let t ∈ T be a generic
element of T and let M (t) be the corresponding principal series module. Since t is generic, Wt = {1}
and                              M
                       M (t) =       M (t)wt,     and      dim(M (t)wt) = 1,
                                  w∈W

for all w ∈ W . We have M (t)gen                                                        gen
                                  wt = M (t)wt since M (t)wt is nonzero whenever M (t)wt is nonzero
                                gen
and we know that dim(M (t)wt ) = 1. Let w ∈ W such that ℓ(si w) = ℓ(w) + 1. Since t is generic
(wt)(X αi ) 6= q ±2 for all w ∈ W . Thus by part (d), the map τi : M (t)gen       gen
                                                                        wt → M (t)si wt is a bijection.
Using the vector vt ∈ M (t)t and the maps τi we can construct a basis {vwt }w∈W of M (t) given by

                                vsi wt = τi vwt ,     if ℓ(si w) = ℓ(w) + 1.

This basis is uniquely determined by the conditions

      (2.8a) X λ vwt = (wt)(X λ )vwt ,                              for all w ∈ W and X λ ∈ X(T ),

     Now we proceed to the proof of the statement. We may assume that H̃ is the affine Hecke
algebra corresponding to a rank two root system R generated by simple roots αi and αj . Let w0

and it follows from (2.8b) that t(Pw ) = aw0 w (t) for all w ∈ W , w 6= w0 . One shows similarly that
t(Qw ) = aw0 w (t) for all w ∈ W , w 6= w0 .
     We have shown that, for each w ∈ W , t(Pw ) = t(Qw ) for all generic t ∈ T . Since Pw and Qw
are rational functions which coincide on all generic points it follows that

The calibration graph
     Let t ∈ T . Define a graph Γ(t) with

                        Vertices:           W t,
                          Edges:         wt ←→ si wt,       if   (wt)(X αi ) 6= q ±2 .


Proposition 2.12. If M is a finite dimensional H̃-module then

                                          dim(Mtgen ) = dim(Mtgen
                                                              ′   )

if t and t′ are in the same connected component of the calibration graph.

Proof. It follows from Proposition (2.7d) that if there is an edge wt ↔ si wt in Γ(t) then the map
      gen
τi : Mwt  → Msgen
                i wt
                                                gen
                     is a bijection. Thus, dim(Mwt  ) = dim(Msgen
                                                               i wt
                                                                    ) if t and si t are connected in the
calibration graph Γ(t).


Corollary 2.13. If M is an irreducible H̃-module with central character t then the support
supp(M ) is a union of connected components of the calibration graph Γ(t).


The connected components of Γ(t)

     Let t ∈ T and define

             Z(t) = {α > 0 | t(X α ) = 1},         and      P (t) = {α > 0 | t(X α ) = q ±2 }.

If J ⊆ P (t) define

                      F (t,J) = {w ∈ W | R(w) ∩ Z(t) = ∅, R(w) ∩ P (t) = J },

where R(w) = {α > 0 | wα < 0} is the inversion set of w. Define a placed shape to be a pair
(t, J ) such that t ∈ T , J ⊆ P (t) and F (t,J) 6= ∅. The elements of the set F (t,J) are called standard
tableaux of shape (t, J ).

Theorem 2.14. The connected components of the calibration graph Γ(t) are given by the partition
of the vertices according to the sets

                            F (t,J) t,     such that J ⊆ P (t) and F (t,J) 6= ∅.


Proof. Let us begin by introducing appropriate notation. The chamber

                                C = {x ∈ Rn | hx, αi > 0 for all α ∈ R+ }
                                                                                           S
is a fundamental chamber for the action of W on Rn and the complement Rn \ (                     α   Hα ) of the
hyperplanes
                          Hα = {x ∈ Rn | hx, αi = 0},   α ∈ R+ ,

in Rn is the disjoint union of the chambers {w−1 C | w ∈ W }. A chamber w−1 C is on the positive
side of the hyperplane Hα if hx, αi > 0 for all x ∈ w−1 C. The chambers adjacent to w−1 C are
the chambers w−1 si C, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and the common face of w−1 C and w−1 si C is contained in the
hyperplane Hw−1 αi .
     Now let t be as in the statement of the Theorem. A result of Steinberg [St, 3.15, 4.2, 5.3] says
that the stabilizer of t is
                                       Wt = hsα | α ∈ Z(t)i,
the subgroup of W generated by the reflections in the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in Z(t).
The elements of the orbit WSt can be identified with the cosets in W/Wt and these can be identified
with the chambers of Rn \ ( α Hα ) which are on the positive side of the hyperplanes Hα , α ∈ Z(t).
Under this bijection the element wt ∈ W t is identified with the chamber w−1 C. The elements wt
and si wt are not connected by an edge in Γ(t) if and only if the hyperplane Hw−1 αi containing the
common face of the corresponding (adjacent) chambers w−1 C and w−1 si C is the hyperplane Hβ
for some root β ∈ P (t). In this way we can identify the graph Γ(t) with the graph with
                                           S
             Vertices:   chambers of Rn \ ( α Hα ) which are on the positive side of the
                              hyperplanes Hα , α ∈ Z(t),
               Edges:    faces of the chambers which are not contained in the
                              hyperplanes Hβ , β ∈ P (t).

The (closures of the) chambers w−1 C which are on the positive side of the hyperplanes Hα ,
α ∈ Z(t), form a convex region in Rn . This region is a disjoint union of smaller convex regions
bounded by the hyperplanes Hβ , β ∈ P (t). Each of the smaller regions is on the positive side of
some of the hyperplanes Hβ , β ∈ P (t), and on the negative side of others. In fact, it is determined
by the set J ⊆ P (t) such that it is on negative side of the hyperplanes Hβ , β ∈ J . These smaller
convex regions correspond to the connected components of Γ(t) and thus the connected components
of Γ(t) are given by the sets {wt | w ∈ F (t,J) } where J ⊆ P (t) and
                                                                                                  

             = w∈W                 on the positive side of the hyperplanes Hα , α ∈ P (t) \ J ,       .
              
                                                                                                 
                                                                                                   
                                    on the negative side of the hyperplanes Hβ , β ∈ J

Since the chamber w−1 C is on the positive side of a hyperplane Hα if and only if wα > 0 it follows
that
                F (t,J) = {w ∈ W | R(w) ∩ Z(t) = ∅, R(w) ∩ P (t) = J }.



3. An H̃-module construction

     Let αi and αj be simple roots in R and let Rij be the rank two root subsystem of R which
is generated by αi and αj . Let Wij be the Weyl group of Rij , the subgroup of W generated by
the simple reflections si and sj . A weight t ∈ T is calibratable for Rij if one of the following two
conditions holds:
     (a) t(X α ) 6= 1 for all α ∈ Rij ,
     (b) Rij is of type C2 or G2 (we may assume that αi is the long root and αj is the short root),
         ut(X αi ) = q 2 and ut(X αj ) = 1 for some u ∈ Wij , and t(X αi ) 6= 1 and t(X αj ) 6= 1.

A placed skew shape is a placed shape (t, J ) such that for all w ∈ F (t,J) and all pairs αi , αj of
simple roots in R the weight wt is calibratable for Rij .

Theorem 3.1. Let (t, J ) be a placed skew shape and let F (t,J) be the set of standard tableaux of
shape (t, J ). Define
                               H̃ (t,J) = C-span{vw | w ∈ F (t,J) },
so that the symbols vw are a labeled basis of the vector space H̃ (t,J) . Then the following formulas
make H̃ (t,J) into an irreducible H̃-module: For each w ∈ F (t,J) ,

               X λ vw    = (wt)(X λ )vw ,                                     for X λ ∈ X, and

                Ti vw    = (Ti )ww vw + (q −1 + (Ti )ww )vsi w ,                  for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,

                      q − q −1
where (Ti )ww =                    , and we set vsi w = 0 if si w 6∈ F (t,J) .
                  1 − (wt)(X −αi )


Proof. Since (t, J ) is a placed skew shape (wt)(X −αi ) 6= 1 for all w ∈ F (t,J) and all simple roots
αi . This implies that the coefficient (Ti )ww is well defined for all i and w ∈ F (t,J) .
      By construction, the nonzero weight spaces of H̃ (t,J) are (H̃ (t,J) )gen
                                                                            wt = (H̃
                                                                                     (t,J)
                                                                                           )wt where w ∈
  (t,J)
F       . These weight spaces have dimension 1 and are all in a single connected component of the
calibration graph Γ(t). If N is a proper submodule of H̃ (t,J) then we would have Nwt 6= 0 and
Nw′ t = 0 for some w 6= w′ , w, w′ ∈ F (t,J) . But since wt and w′ t are in the same connected
component of Γ(t) this would contradict Proposition 2.12. Thus H̃ (t,J) is irreducible if it is an
H̃-module.
      It remains to show that the defining relations for H̃ are satisfied.

                     = (wt)(X )                         + (q − q )                              vw

                        1 − (wt)(X −αi )
                    = Ti X λ vw .

(b) Let w ∈ F (t,J) . Using the fact that (Ti )ww + (Ti )si w,si w = q − q −1 we have

        Ti2 vw = ((Ti )2ww + (q −1 + (Ti )ww )(q −1 + (Ti )si w,si w ))vw
                            + (q −1 + (Ti )ww )((Ti )ww + (Ti )si w,si w )vsi w
              = (Ti )ww ((Ti )ww + (Ti )si w,si w )vw + q −1 (q −1 + (Ti )ww + (Ti )si w,si w ))vw

(c) The braid relation. Let αi and αj be simple roots in R and let w ∈ F (t,J) . Since (t, J ) is a
placed skew shape wt is calibratable. There are two distinct cases to consider.
Case 1: When wt is Rij -regular, i.e. (uwt)(X αi ) 6= 1 and (uwt)(X αj ) 6= 1 for all u ∈ Wij .
     Let us extend our notation vσ to all σ ∈ W by assuming that vσ = 0 whenever σ 6∈ F (t,J) .
Then, for all u ∈ Wij , the definition of the action of Ti allows us to write
                                                                             

                   Ti −                      vuw = q +                             vsi uw
                          1 − (wt)(X −αi )                   1 − (wt)(X −αi )
                                                                            
                                                      q − q −1 (wt)(X −αi )
                                                 =                             vsi uw
                                                        1 − (wt)(X −αi )
whenever ℓ(si u) > ℓ(u) and (uwt)(X −αi ) 6= 1. (This is correct because if ℓ(si u) > ℓ(u) and vuw = 0
then vsi uw = 0.)
    Since wt is Rij -regular all of the factors in the following product are well defined and, by [Bou,
Ch. VI §1 Cor. 2 to Prop. 17],

Case 2: Let u ∈ Wij be of minimal length such that (uwt)(X αi ) = q 2 and (uwt)(X αj ) = 1. The
only possibilities are the following.
Type C2 :
(1) u = si : Then
                                      X αi vw = q −2 vw ,          X αj vw = q 2 vw ,
                                      Ti vw = −q −1 vw ,            Tj vw = qvw .
(2) u = si sj : Then
                                      X αi vw = q 2 vw ,         X αj vw = q −2 vw ,

Type G2 :
(1) u = si : Then
                                      X αi vw = q −2 vw ,         X α2 vw = q 2 vw ,

(2) u = si sj or u = si sj si . Then both w and si w are in F (t,J) and the action of X αi , X αj , Ti and
Tj on C-span{vw , vsi w } is given by the matrices:

(3) u = si sj si sj : Then
                                      X αi vw = q 2 vw ,         X αj vw = q −2 vw ,
                                       Ti vw = qvw ,             Tj vw = −q −1 vw .
For each of these cases one checks the braid relations by direct computation. For type G2 case
(2) the calculations can be simplified by observing that T1 T2 T1 = T2 T1 T2 as operators on C-
span{vw , vsi w }. From this it follows that T1 T2 T1 T2 T1 T2 = T2 T1 T2 T1 T2 T1 as operators on C-
span{vw , vsi w }.



4. Calibrated Representations

     A finite dimensional H̃-module

                                  M is calibrated if Mtgen = Mt , for all t ∈ T .

A calibrated module M is really calibrated if t = tr for all t ∈ T , i.e. tc = 1 in the polar
decomposition (2.1).
         L that t ∈ T is regular, gen
     Suppose                       i.e. the stabilizer Wt of t under the action of W is trivial. Then
                                                                                       gen
M (t) = w∈W Mwt , since each Mwt        is one dimensional and Mwt 6= 0 whenever Mwt       6= 0. Thus
M (t) is calibrated when t is regular. So any quotient of M (t) is calibrated and, by Proposition
2.6b, any irreducible H̃-module M with regular central character is calibrated.

Classification of irreducible calibrated modules
     We shall eventually show that the modules H̃ (t,J) constructed in Theorem 3.1 are all the
irreducible calibrated H̃-modules. The following Proposition shows that the formulas which define
the H̃-modules in Theorem 3.1 are more or less forced.

Proposition 4.1. Let M be a calibrated H̃-module and assume that for all t ∈ T such that
Mt 6= 0,
            (A1) t(Xiα ) 6= 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and    (A2) dim(Mt ) = 1.
For each b ∈ T such that Mb 6= 0 let vb be a nonzero vector in Mb . The vectors {vb } form a basis
of M . Let (Ti )cb ∈ C and b(X λ ) ∈ C be given by
                                          X
                               Ti vb =         (Ti )cb vc     and       X λ vb = b(X λ )vb .
                                           c

Then
                          q − q −1
     (a) (Ti )bb =                     , for all vb in the basis,
                      1 − b(X −αi )
     (b) If (Ti )cb 6= 0 then c = si b,
     (c) (Ti )b,si b (Ti )si b,b = (q −1 + (Ti )bb )(q −1 + (Ti )si b,si b ).


Proof. The defining equation for H̃,

                                                                         1 − X −αi
forces
                  X                                                           b(X λ ) − b(X si λ )
                          c(X λ )(Ti )cb − (Ti )cb b(X si λ ) vc = (q − q −1 )                      vb

                                                                                 1 − b(X −αi )
Comparing coefficients gives

                          c(X λ )(Ti )cb − (Ti )cb b(X si λ ) = 0,        if b 6= c, and


                                                                                b(X λ ) − b(X si λ )
                          b(X λ )(Ti )bb − (Ti )bb b(X si λ ) = (q − q −1 )                          .
                                                                                  1 − b(X −αi )

These relations give:

                    If     (Ti )cb 6= 0     then       b(X si λ ) = c(X λ )      for all X λ ∈ X, and

                          q − q −1
          (Ti )bb =                        if b(X −αi ) 6= 1 and b(X λ ) 6= b(X si λ ) for some X λ ∈ X.
                        1 − b(X −αi )
By assumption (A1), b(X αi ) 6= 1 for all i. For each fundamental weight ωi , X ωi ∈ X and
b(X si ωi ) = b(X ωi −αi ) 6= b(X ωi ) since b(X αi ) 6= 1. Thus we conclude that

                                                                                              q − q −1

This completes the proof of (a) and (b). By the definition of H̃ the vector

                Ti2 vb = ((Ti )2bb + (Ti )b,si b (Ti )si b,b )vb + ((Ti )bb + (Ti )si b,si b )(Ti )si b,b vsi b

must equal

                 ((q − q −1 )Ti + 1)vb = ((q − q −1 )(Ti )bb + 1)vb + (q − q −1 )(Ti )si b,b vsi b .

Using the formula for (Ti )bb and (Ti )si b,si b we find (Ti )bb + (Ti )si b,si b = (q − q −1 ). So, by comparing
coefficients of vb , we obtain the equation

       (Ti )b,si b (Ti )si b,b = (q − (Ti )bb )((Ti )bb + q −1 ) = (q −1 + (Ti )bb )(q −1 + (Ti )si b,si b ).


Proposition 4.2. Let M be an irreducible calibrated module. Then, for all t ∈ T such that
Mt 6= 0,
(a) t(X αi ) 6= 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and
(b) dim(Mt ) = 1.

Proof. (a) The proof is by contradiction. Assume that t(X αi ) = 1. Let H̃A1 be the subalgebra of
H̃ generated by Ti and X αi and view M as an H̃A1 -module by restriction. Let mt be a nonzero
element of Mt . There is an H̃A1 -module homomorphism

                                                 φ:     M (t) −→           M
                                                         vt   7−→          mt

where M (t) is the (two dimensional) principal series module for H̃A1 and vt is the generator of
M (t). It is easy to check that when t(X αi ) = 1 the module M (t) is an irreducible H̃A1 -module.
Thus the map φ is injective and we can view M (t) as a submodule of M . A direct check shows
that M (t) is not calibrated and thus it follows that M is not calibrated. This is a contradiction to
the assumption that M is calibrated. Thus t(X αi ) 6= 1.
     (b) The proof is by contradiction. Assume that t ∈ T is such that dim(Mt ) > 1. Let mt be
a nonzero element of Mt . Since M is calibrated, the action of any τi on any weight vector m is a
linear combination of the action of Ti and a multiple of the identity. Thus, since M is irreducible,
we must be able to generate the rest of Mt by applying τ -operators to mt . Since dim(Mt ) > 1
there must be a sequence of τ -operators such that

                                                  nt = τi1 τi2 · · · τip mt

is a nonzero vector in Mt which is not a multiple of mt . Assume that the sequence τi1 τi2 · · · τip is
chosen so that p is minimal.
     Let us defer, momentarily, the proof of the following claim.
Claim: The element si1 si2 · · · sip = 1 in W .
The claim implies that there is some 1 < k ≤ p such that si1 si2 · · · sik is not reduced and we can use
the braid relations to rewrite this word as si′1 · · · si′k−2 sik sik . By Proposition 2.7e the τi operators
also satisfy the braid relations and so

                                        nt = τi′1 τi′2 · · · τi′k−2 τik τik · · · τip mt .

By Proposition 2.7b, the operator τik τik is equal to a constant times the identity map and thus

                                      nt = cτi′1 τi′2 · · · τi′k−2 τik+1 · · · τip mt ,

where c is some constant. The constant c must be nonzero since nt is not 0. But the expression

                                    c−1 nt = τi′1 τi′2 · · · τi′k−2 τik+1 · · · τip mt

is shorter than the original expression of nt and this contradicts the minimality of p. It follows
that dim(Mt ) ≤ 1.
Proof of the claim. By [St, 3.15, 4.2, 5.3] the stabilizer Wt of t under the action of W is

                    Wt = hsα | α ∈ Z(t)i            where           Z(t) = {α > 0 | t(X α ) = 1}.

The elements of the orbit W tScan be identified with the cosets of W/Wt and these can be identified
with the chambers of Rn \ ( α Hα ) which are on the positive side of all the hyperplanes Hα for
α ∈ Z(t). Specifically, the element t ∈ W t corresponds to the chamber C and the element wt of
W t corresponds to the chamber w−1 C.
       For any 1 ≤ j ≤ p we have that (sij+1 · · · sip t)(X αij ) 6= 1, since τij · · · τip mt is well defined.
This means that sij (sij+1 · · · sip t)(X ωij ) = (sij+1 · · · sip t)(X ωij −αij ) 6= (sij+1 · · · sip t)(X ωij ) and
thus that sij (sij+1 · · · sip t) 6= sij+1 · · · sip t. So sij · · · sip t and sij+1 · · · sip t both correspond to
chambers on the positive side of all the hyperplanes Hα , α ∈ Z(t). These two chambers have
a common face and this face is contained in the hyperplane Hsip ...sij+1 αj .
       In this way we can identify the sequence t, sip t, sip−1 sip t, . . . , si1 · · · sip t with a sequence of
chambers where successive chambers in the sequence are adjacent (share a face) and all the
chambers in the sequence are on the positive side of all the hyperplanes Hα , α ∈ Z(t). Since
si1 . . . sip t = t, the first and last chamber in this sequence are the same. It follows that si1 · · · sip = 1
in W .


Proposition 4.3. Let M be an irreducible calibrated H̃-module. Suppose that Mt and Msi t are
both nonzero. Then the map τi : Mt → Msi t is a bijection.

Proof. By Proposition 4.2b, dim(Mt ) = dim(Msi t ) = 1, and thus it is sufficient to show that τi
is not the zero map. Let vt be a nonzero vector in Mt . Since M is irreducible there must be a
sequence of τ operators such that
                                      vsi t = τi1 · · · τip vt
is a nonzero element of Msi t . Let p be minimal such that this is the case. We have τi τi1 · · · τip vt ∈
Mt . Using the claim which was proved in the proof of Proposition 4.2 we have that si si1 · · · sip = 1
in W . For notational convenience i0 = i. Let 0 ≤ k < p be maximal such that sik sik+1 · · · sip is
not reduced. If k 6= 0 then we can use the braid relations to get

                                       vsi t = τi1 · · · τik τik τi′k+2 · · · τi′p vt .

By Proposition 2.7c τik τik is a multiple of the identity and so

                                       vsi t = cτi1 · · · τik−1 τi′k+2 · · · τi′p vt .
18                                            arun ram

But this contradicts the minimality of p. Thus we must have k = 0, p = 1 and

                                            vsi t = τi vt .

Thus, since vsi t 6= 0, τi 6= 0.


Proposition 4.4. If M is a calibrated H̃-module and t ∈ T is such that Mt 6= 0 then t is
calibratable for all Rij generated by simple roots αi and αj in R.

Proof. Let H̃ij be the subalgebra of H̃ generated by Ti , Tj , X αi , and X αj and view M as an Hij
module by restriction. The irreducible representations of rank two affine Hecke algebras have been
classified and constructed explicitly in [Ra3]. From this classification it is easy to check that the
only weights t which appear in calibrated H̃ij -modules are those that are calibratable for Rij .
Thus, if Mt 6= 0, then t must be calibratable for Rij .


Theorem 4.5. Let M be an irreducible calibrated H̃-module. Let t be the central character of
M and let J = R(w) ∩ P (t) for any w ∈ W such that Mwt 6= 0. Then (t, J ) is a placed skew shape
and
                                        M∼ = H̃ (t,J) ,
where H (t,J) is the module defined in Theorem 3.1.


Proof. Proposition 4.3 shows that if Mt and Msi t are both nonzero then both τi : Mt → Msi t
and τi : Msi t → Mt are bijections. Thus, by Proposition 2.7d t(X αi ) 6= q ±2 and so there is an
edge t ↔ si t in the calibration graph. This shows that supp(M ) is a single connected component
of the calibration graph Γ(t). Then (t, J ) (as defined in the statement of the Theorem) is the
corresponding placed shape. By Proposition 4.4 (t, J ) must be a placed skew shape. Propositions
4.1 and 4.2 show that there is at most one calibrated H̃-module M such that supp(M ) is the
connected component of Γ(t) labeled by (t, J ). Thus we must have that M ∼   = H̃ (t,J) .
