                                                   Abstract. We construct an endoscopic decomposition for local L-packets as-
                                                   sociated to irreducible cuspidal Deligne–Lusztig representations. Moreover, the
                                                   obtained decomposition is compatible with inner twistings.

                                               Let E be a local non-archimedean field, with ring of integers O and residue field
                                            Fq of characteristic p. We denote by Γ ⊃ W ⊃ I the absolute Galois, the Weil
                                            and the inertia groups of E. Let G be a reductive group over E, L G = G        b ⋊ W its
                                            complex Langlands dual group, and D(G(E)) the space of invariant distributions
                                            on G(E).
                                               Every admissible homomorphism λ : W → L G (see [Ko1, § 10]) gives rise to a finite
                                            group Sλ := π0 (ZGb (λ)/Z(G)b Γ ), where Z b (λ) is the centralizer of λ(W ) in G.
                                                                                                                            b Every
                                                                                       G
                                            conjugacy class κ of Sλ defines an endoscopic subspace Dκ,λ(G(E)) ⊂ D(G(E)). For
                                            simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the elliptic case, where λ(W ) does not lie in
                                            any proper Levi subgroup of L G.
                                               Langlands conjectured that every elliptic λ corresponds to a finite set Πλ , called
                                            an L-packet, of cuspidal irreducible representations of G(E). Moreover, the sub-
                                            space Dλ (G(E)) ⊂ D(G(E)), generated by characters {χ(π)}π∈Πλ , should have
                                            an endoscopic decomposition. More precisely, it is expected ([La1, IV, 2]) that
                                            there exists
                                                    P a basis {aπ }π∈Πλ of the space of central functions on Sλ such that
                                            χκ,λ := π∈Πλ aπ (κ)χ(π) belongs to Dκ,λ(G) for every conjugacy class κ of Sλ .
                                               The goal of this paper is to construct the endoscopic decomposition of Dλ (G(E))
                                            for tamely ramified λ’s such that ZGb (λ(I)) is a maximal torus. In this case, G splits
                                            over an unramified extension of E, and λ factors through L T ֒→ L G for an elliptic
                                            unramified maximal torus T of G. By the local Langlands correspondence for tori

([La2]), a homomorphism λ : W → L T defines a tamely ramified homomorphism
θ : T (E) → C× . Each κ ∈ Sλ = TbΓ /Z(G)     b Γ gives rise to an elliptic endoscopic
datum Eκ,λ of G, while characters of Sλ are in bijection with conjugacy classes of
embeddings T ֒→ G, stably conjugate to the inclusion. Therefore each character a
of Sλ gives rise to an irreducible cuspidal representation πa,λ of G(E) (denoted by
πa,θ in Notation 2.3).
   Our main resultPasserts, for fields E of sufficiently large residual characteristic,
that each χκ,λ := a a(κ)χ(πa,λ ) is Eκ,λ-stable. Moreover, the resulting endoscopic
decomposition of Dλ (G(E)) is compatible with inner twistings. For simplicity, we
restrict ourselves to local fields of characteristic zero, while the case of positive
characteristic follows by approximation (see [Ka3, De]).
   Our argument goes as follows. First we prove the stability of the restriction of
χκ,λ to the subset of topologically unipotent elements of G(E). If p is sufficiently
large, this assertion reduces to the analogous assertion about distributions on the
Lie algebra. Now the stability follows from a combination of a Springer hypothesis
[Ka1] and a generalization of a theorem of Waldspurger [Wa]. To prove the result
in general, we use the topological Jordan decomposition ([Ka2]).
   When this work was in the process of writing, we have heard that S. DeBacker
and M. Reeder obtained similar results.
                           Notation and Conventions.
   In addition to the notation introduced above, we use the following conventions:
   For a reductive group G, always assumed to be connected, we denote by Z(G),
G , Gder , Gsc , Gδ and Gsr the center of G, the adjoint group of G, the derived group
  ad

of G, the simply connected covering of Gder , the centralizer of δ ∈ G, and the set
of strongly regular semisimple elements of G (that is, the set of δ ∈ G such that
Gδ ⊂ G is a maximal torus) respectively.
   Denote by G, T , and L Lie algebras of the algebraic groups G, T and L.
   Let E be a local non-archimedean field of characteristic zero, E a fixed algebraic
closure of E, and E nr a maximal unramified extension of E in E.
   For a reductive group G (resp. its Lie algebra G) over E, we denote by S(G(E))
(resp. S(G(E))) the space of locally constant measures with compact support. We
denote by D(G(E)) (resp. D(G(E))) the space of invariant distributions on G(E)
(resp. G(E)), namely G(E)-invariant linear functionals on S(G(E)) (resp S(G(E))),
where G(E) acts by conjugation. Whenever necessary we equip G(E) and G(E)
with invariant measures, denoted by µ, defined by a translation-invariant top degree
differential form on G. We denote by G(E)tu (resp. G(E)tn ) the set of topologically
unipotent (resp. topologically nilpotent) elements of G(E) (resp. G(E)). Finally,

                                                                          ad )
we denote by rk(G) the rank of G over E, and put e(G) := (−1)rk(G                . Note that
our sign e(G) differs from that defined by Kottwitz.

                     2. Formulation of the Main result
2.1. Let L be a connected reductive group over Fq , and a : T ֒→ L an embedding of
a maximal elliptic torus of L. Following Deligne and Lusztig, we associate to every
character θ : T (Fq ) → C× in general position an irreducible cuspidal representation
ρa,θ of L(Fq ) (see [DL, Prop. 7.4 and Thm. 8.3]).

2.2. There is an equivalence of categories T 7→ T between tori over E splitting over
E nr and tori over Fq . Every such T has a canonical O-structure.
Notation 2.3. a) Let G be a reductive group over E, T a torus over E splitting
over E nr , and a : T ֒→ G an embedding of a maximal elliptic torus of G. Then G
splits over E nr , and a(T (O)) lies in a unique parahoric subgroup Ga of G(E). Let
Ga+ be the pro-unipotent radical of Ga . Then there exists a canonical reductive
group La over Fq with an identification La (Fq ) = Ga /Ga+ . Moreover, a : T ֒→ G
induces an embedding a : T ֒→ La of a maximal elliptic torus of La .
   b) Let θ : T (E) → C× be a character in general position, trivial on Ker[T (O) →
T (Fq )]. Denote by θ : T (Fq ) → C× the character of T (Fq ) defined by θ. Then there
exists a unique irreducible representation ρa,θ of Z(G)(E)Ga , whose central character
is the restriction of θ, extending the inflation to Ga of the cuspidal Deligne–Lusztig
representation ρa,θ of La (Fq ). We denote by πa,θ the induced cuspidal representation
    G(E)
IndZ(G)(E)Ga ρa,θ of G(E).

2.4. Recall (see [Ko2, Thm 1.2]) that for every reductive group G over E, H 1 (E, G)
                                             b Γ )D of C× -valued characters of π0 (Z(G)
is canonically isomorphic to the group π0 (Z(G)                                       b Γ ).
If T is a maximal torus of G, we get a commutative diagram:
                                          ∼
                            H 1 (E, T ) −−−→     π0 (TbΓ)D
                                                     
                                                     
                                 y                    y
                                          ∼       b Γ )D .
                            H 1 (E, G) −−−→ π0 (Z(G)
In particular, we have a canonical surjection
   TbΓ /Z(G)
          b Γ → Coker[π0 (Z(G)
                            b Γ ) → π0 (TbΓ )] → (Ker [H 1 (E, T ) → H 1 (E, G)])D .
                                               ∼


Notation 2.5. a) To every pair a, a′ of stably conjugate embeddings T ֒→ G, one
associates the class inv(a′ , a) ∈ Ker [H 1 (E, T ) → H 1 (E, G)]. This is the class of a
cocycle cσ = g −1σ(g), where g ∈ G(E) is such that a′ = gag −1 (compare [Ko2, 4.1]).

  b) To each κ ∈ TbΓ /Z(G)
                         b Γ , an embedding a0 : T ֒→ G, and a character θ of T (E)
as in Notation 2.3, we associate the invariant distribution
                                       X
                      χa0 ,κ,θ := e(G)   hinv(a, a0 ), κiχ(πa,θ ).
                                        a

Here a runs over a set of representatives of conjugacy classes of embeddings which
are stably conjugate to a0 , and χ(πa,θ ) denotes the character of πa,θ .
Notation 2.6. Each pair (a, κ), where a : T ֒→ G is an embedding of a maximal
torus of G and κ is an element of TbΓ , gives rise to an isomorphism class E(a,κ) of an
endoscopic datum of G. Furthermore, E(a,κ) is elliptic if a(T ) is an elliptic torus of
G (see [Ko1, §7] for the definitions of endoscopic data, and compare [La1, II, 4]).
  More precisely, each embedding η : Tb ֒→ G,    b whose conjugacy class corresponds
to the stable conjugacy class of a, defines an endoscopic datum E(a,κ,η) = (s, ρ),
                                                                                    ρT
consisting of a semisimple element s = η(κ) of G    b and a homomorphism ρ : Γ −→
                            ρ′
NormAut Gb (η(Tb))s /η(Tb) −→ Out(G  b0 ). Here ρT is induced by the E-structure of T ,
                                      s
and ρ′ is induced by the inclusion NormAut Gb (η(Tb))s ⊂ NormAut Gb (G  b0 ). Moreover,
                                                                         s
the isomorphism class of E(a,κ,η) , denoted by E(a,κ) , does not depend on η.
                                                   Γ
Notation 2.7. For each γ ∈ Gsr (E) and ξ ∈ G        cγ ,
 (i) put E(γ,ξ) := E(aγ ,ξ) , where aγ : Gγ ֒→ G is the inclusion map;
 (ii) fix an invariant measure dgγ on Gγ (E), and put
                                       Z
                                                               dg
                             Oγ (φ) :=              f (gγg −1)
                                        G(E)/Gγ (E)            dgγ
for each φ = f dg ∈ S(G(E)).
                           cγ Γ /Z(G)
   (iii) denote by ξ ∈ π0 (G       b Γ ) the class of ξ;
                                              P
   (iv) denote by Oγξ ∈ D(G(E)) the sum γ ′ hinv(γ ′ , γ), ξiOγ ′ , taken over a set of
representatives of the conjugacy classes stably conjugate to γ, where each dgγ ′ is
compatible with dgγ .
Definition 2.8. Let E be an endoscopic datum of G.
   (i) A measure φ ∈ S(G(E)) is called E-unstable if Oγξ (φ) = 0 for all pairs (γ, ξ) as
in Notation 2.7 for which E(γ,ξ) is isomorphic to E.
   (ii) A distribution F ∈ D(G(E)) is called E-stable if F (φ) = 0 for all E-unstable
φ ∈ S(G(E)).
Theorem 2.9. Assume that p > dim Gder . Then for each triple (a0 , κ, θ), the
distribution χa0 ,κ,θ is E(a0 ,κ) -stable.

Notation 2.10. For an endoscopic datum E = (s, ρ), choose a representative se ∈ G     bsc
of s, and let Z(E) be the set of z ∈ Z(G bsc )Γ for which there exists g ∈ G
                                                                           bs commuting
with ρ : Γ → Out(G  b0s ) such that ge
                                     sg −1 = ze s. Then Z(E) is a subgroup of Z(G b sc )Γ ,
depending only on the isomorphism class of E.
Definition 2.11. Let E be an endoscopic datum of G. An inner twisting ϕ :
G → G′ is called E-admissible if the corresponding class inv(G′ , G) ∈ H 1 (E, Gad ) ∼
                                                                                     =

Definition 2.12. Let G be a reductive group over E, E = (s, ρ) an elliptic endo-
scopic datum of G, and ϕ : G → G′ an E-admissible inner twisting. Fix a triple
(a, a′ ; κ), consisting of a pair a : T ֒→ G and a′ : T ֒→ G′ of stably conjugate
embeddings of maximal tori, and an element κ ∈ TbΓ such that E(a,κ) ∼             = E.
  a) Consider φ ∈ S(G(E)) and φ ∈ S(G (E)). They are called (a, a′ ; κ)-
                                             ′        ′

indistinguishable if they satisfy the following conditions.
  (A) For every γ ∈ Gsr (E) and ξ ∈ G            cγ Γ such that E(γ,ξ) ∼
                                                                       = E and Oγξ (φ) 6= 0,
  (i) there exists γ ′ ∈ G′ (E) stably conjugate to γ;
                                  ′ ,γ;ξ
  (ii) we have, Oγξ ′ (φ′ ) = h aγ′ ,a;κ i−1 Oγξ (φ).

Here h aγ′ ,a;κ
           ,γ;ξ
                i ∈ C× is the invariant h aγ ′ ,a;κ i defined in the Appendix for embeddings
aγ : Gγ ֒→ G and aγ ′ : Gγ ֒→ G′ such that aγ (γ) = γ and aγ ′ (γ) = γ ′ .
  (B) Condition (A) holds if G, a0 , γ, φ are interchanged with G′ , a′0 , γ ′ , φ′ .
  b) The distributions F ∈ D(G(E)) and F ′ ∈ D(G′ (E)) are called (a, a′ ; κ)-
equivalent if F (φ) = F ′ (φ′ ) for every two (a, a′ ; κ)-indistinguishable measures φ
and φ′ .
Remark 2.13. If φ is E(a0 ,κ) -unstable, then φ and φ′ = 0 are (a0 , a′0 ; κ)-indistinguishable.
Therefore every two (a0 , a′0 ; κ)-equivalent distributions F and F ′ are E(a0 ,κ) -stable.
Main Theorem 2.14. Assume that p > dim Gder . Let ϕ : G → G′ be an E(a0 ,κ) -
admissible inner twisting. Let a′0 : T ֒→ G′ be an embedding which is stably conjugate
to a0 . Then the distributions χa0 ,κ,θ on G(E) and χa′0 ,κ,θ on G′ (E) are (a0 , a′0 ; κ)-
equivalent.
Remark 2.15. a) By Remark 2.13, Theorem 2.9 follows from the Main Theorem.
 b) We believe that a much smaller bound on p would suffice.

                     3. Basic ingredients of the argument
3.1. A generalization of a theorem of Waldspurger. Suppose that we are
in the situation of Definition 2.12. Then ϕ induces an inner twisting G → G ′ .

on G, and ϕ-compatible invariant measures on G(E) and G ′ (E). Then ϕ defines a
nondegenerate G′ -invariant pairing h·, ·i′ on G ′ . These data define Fourier transforms
F 7→ F (F ) on G(E) and G ′ (E).
Theorem 3.1. The distributions F ∈ D(G(E)) and F ′ ∈ D(G ′ (E)) are (a, a′ ; κ)-
equivalent if and only if e(G)F (F ) and e(G′ )F (F ′ ) are (a, a′ ; κ)-equivalent.
  The proof is a generalization of that of Waldspurger [Wa] who treated the case
    ′
φ = 0 (compare also [KP, Thm. 2.7.1], where the stable case is treated).

3.2. Springer hypothesis. In the notation of 2.1, assume that a(T )(Fq ) ⊂ L(Fq )
contains an L-regular element t [and that p is so large that the logarithm defines
                               ∼
an isomorphism log : Lun → Lnil between unipotent elements of L and nilpotent
elements of L]. Let δt be the characteristic function of the Ad(L(Fq ))-orbit of t, and
let F (δt ) be its Fourier transform.
   We need the following result of [Ka1].
Theorem 3.2. For every u ∈ Lun (Fq ), we have

                     Tr ρa,θ (u) = q −(dim L−dim T )/2 F (δt )(log(u)).
3.3. Topological Jordan decomposition. We will call an element γ ∈ G(E)
compact if it generates a relatively compact subgroup of G(E). We will call an
                                                                  n
element γ ∈ G(E) topologically unipotent if the sequence {γ p }n converges to 1.
Every topologically unipotent element is compact.
   The following result is a rather straightforward generalization of [Ka2, Lem. 2, p.
226].
Lemma 3.3. For every compact element γ ∈ G(E) there exists a unique decom-
position γ = δu such that δ and u commute, δ is of finite order prime to p, and
u is topologically unipotent. In particular, this decomposition is compatible with
conjugation and field extensions.

4.1. Reformulation of the problem.
Notation 4.1. To each a : T ֒→ G and θ : T (E) → C× as in Notation 2.3 we
associate a function ta,θ on G(E) supported on Z(G)(E)Ga and equal to Tr ρa,θ

there. Since ta,θ is cuspidal the integral
                                           Z
                                    1

                                µ((Gad )a ) G(E)/Z(G)(E)
stabilizes for every γ ∈ Gsr (E) (see [HC, Lem. 23]), thus providing us with a locally
constant invariant function Fa,θ on Gsr (E).
Lemma 4.2. For each a and θ, Fa,θ is a locally L1 -function on G(E). Moreover,
the corresponding distribution equals χ(πa,θ ).
Proof. The assertion follows from Harish-Chandra’s theorem [HC, Thm. 16].                        

4.5. It follows from Lemma 4.2 that Theorem 4.4 is equivalent to the Main Theorem.
Moreover, by standard arguments, Theorem 4.4 reduces to the case when the derived
group of G is simply connected.
4.6. From now on we will assume that Gder = Gsc . In particular, the centralizer
of each semisimple element of G is connected, and each Ga is a maximal compact
subgroup of G(E). We fix (γ0 , ξ) such that ΣG;γ0 ,ξ;a0 ,κ 6= 0. Since ΣG;zγ0 ,ξ;a0 ,κ =
θ(z)ΣG;γ0 ,ξ;a0 ,κ for each z ∈ Z(G)(E) and since the support of each ta,θ consists of
elements compact modulo center, we can assume that γ0 is compact with topolog-
ical Jordan decomposition γ0 = δ0 u0 . Moreover, we can assume either that γ0 is
topologically unipotent, or that δ0 ∈/ Z(G)(E).
4.2. The topologically unipotent case.
4.7. Since p does not divide the order of Z(Gder ), the canonical map Gder (E)tu ×
Z(G)(E)tu → G(E)tu is an isomorphism. Therefore to prove Theorem 4.4 for topo-
logically unipotent γ0 , we can assume that G is semisimple and simply connected.

Notation 4.8. Denote by ΦG : G → G the composition map
                                 Ad           log(p)           pr
                         G −→ GL(G) −→ End(G) −→ G,
                         Pp−1 Ai
where log(p) (1 − A) = − i=1 i , and pr is the canonical projection, defined by the
standard pairing (A, B) 7→ Tr AB on End(G).
Lemma 4.9. The map ΦG defines a G(E)-equivariant homeomorphism
        ∼
G(E)tu → G(E)tn , where G(E) acts by conjugation Moreover, for every parahoric
                                                                ∼
subgroup Gx of G(E), ΦG induces a bijection (ΦG )x : (Gx )tu → (Gx )tn , which in turn
                                              ∼
induces the logarithm map log : (Lx )un (Fq ) → (Lx )nil (Fq ).
Notation 4.10. a) By our assumption on p, there exists t ∈ T (O) whose reduction
t ∈ T (Fq ) is not fixed by any nontrivial element of Weyl group of G.
   b) For every a : T ֒→ G as in Notation 2.3, we denote by Ωa,t ⊂ La (Fq ) the
Ad(La (Fq ))-orbit of a(t), by Ω e a,t ⊂ Ga ⊂ G the preimage of Ωa,t , and let δa,t be the
characteristic function of Ωe a,t .
   c) As the centralizer Gy of each y ∈ Ω   e a,t is Ga -conjugate to a(T ), the integral
                                             Z
                                         1

                                       µ(Ga ) G(E)
converges absolutely for each x ∈ G(E). Thus it defines
                                                    P an element of D(G(E)). Sim-
ilarly to Notation 2.5, we consider ∆a0 ,κ,t := e(G) a hinv(a, a0 ), κi∆a,t ∈ D(G(E)).
Lemma 4.11. Let I + ⊂ G(E) be a maximal topologically nilpotent subalgebra. As-
sume that ψ : E → C× is trivial on the maximal ideal M ⊂ O and induces a
nontrivial character of Fq . Then for each u ∈ G(E)tu we have
                              ta,θ (u) = µ(I + )−1 F (δa,t )(ΦG (u)).
Proof. The assumption on ψ implies that Ga+ is the orthogonal complement of Ga
with respect to the pairing (x, y) 7→ ψ(hx, yi). Therefore our lemma is an immediate
consequence of the definition of the Fourier transform (over E and Fq ), Theorem
3.2, Lemma 4.9, and the equality q (dim La −dim T )/2 µ(Ga+ ) = µ(I + ).          
4.12. Now we are ready to show that (χa0 ,κ,θ )|G(E)tu and (χa′0 ,κ,θ )|G′ (E)tu are (a0 , a′0 ; κ)-
equivalent. First of all, by direct calculations, e(G)∆a0 ,κ,t is (a0 , a′0 ; κ)-equivalent to
e(G′ )∆a′0 ,κ,t. Hence by Theorem 3.1, F (∆a0 ,κ,t ) is (a0 , a′0 ; κ)-equivalent to F (∆a′0 ,κ,t ).
Using Lemmas 4.2, 4.9 and 4.11 we see that χa0 ,κ,θ has the same restriction to G(E)tu
as µ(I + )−1 Φ∗G (F (∆a0 ,κ,t)), and similarly for χa′0 ,κ,θ and µ(I ′+ )−1 Φ∗G′ (F (∆a′0 ,κ,t)).
Since ΦG is Gad -invariant algebraic morphism defined over E, the assertion follows
from the equality µ(I + ) = µ(I ′+ ).

4.3. The general case. It remains to prove Theorem 4.4 for δ0 ∈/ Z(G)(E) (see
4.6). We are going to deduce the assertion from that for Gδ0 .
Proposition 4.13. For every embedding a : T ֒→ G and a compact element γ in
G(E) with topological Jordan decomposition γ = δu, we have
                                           X
                     e(G)Fa,θ (γ) = e(Gδ )   θ(b−1 (δ))Fb,θ (u).
                                                                    b
Here b runs over the set of conjugacy classes of embeddings b : T ֒→ Gδ whose
composition with the inclusion Gδ ⊂ G is conjugate to a.
Proof. The proposition follows by direct calculation from the recursive formula ([DL,
Thm. 4.2]) for characters of Deligne–Lusztig representations.                      
Notation 4.14. a) We say that t ∈ T (E) is (G, a0 , γ0 )-relevant if there exists an
embedding b0 : T ֒→ Gδ0 ⊂ G stably conjugate to a0 such that b(t) = δ0 .
  b) Assume that t ∈ T (E) is (G, a0 , γ0)-relevant. Since a0 (T ) ⊂ G is elliptic, for
each δ ∈ G(E) stably conjugate to δ0 there exists an embedding bt,δ : T ֒→ Gδ ⊂ G
stably conjugate to a0 such that bt,δ (t) = δ. Further, bt,δ is unique up to stable
conjugacy, and the endoscopic datum Et,κ := E(bδ,t ,κ) of Gδ0 is independent of δ.
  c) We will write δ1 ∼ δ (resp. δ ′ ∼ δ) if δ, δ1 ∈ G(E) (resp. δ ∈ G(E) and
                                     Et,κ                Et,κ
δ ∈ G (E)) are stably conjugate to δ0 , and Gδ1 (resp. G′δ′ ) is an Et,κ -admissible
 ′       ′

inner form of Gδ (see Definition 2.11).
4.15. Using Proposition 4.13, we see that
                                           X      X
(4.2)                     ΣG;γ0 ,ξ;a0 ,κ =   θ(t)   It,δ ,
                                                                t       δ
where
  (i) t runs over the set of (G, a0 , γ0 )-relevant elements of T (E);
  (ii) δ runs over a set of representatives of the conjugacy classes within the stable
conjugacy class of δ0 ;
  (iii) It,δ vanishes unless there exists an element γ ∈ G(E) stably conjugate to γ0
with topological Jordan decomposition γ = δu, in which case we get
(4.3)                         It,δ = hinv(bt,δ , a0 ), κihinv(γ, γ0 ), ξi−1 ΣGδ ;u,ξ;bt,δ ,κ .
4.16. For simplicity of the exposition, we will restrict ourselves to the case when
γ0 ∈ G(E) is elliptic. Choose t which has a nonzero contribution
                                                       P         to (4.2). Replacing
δ0 by a stably conjugate element we can assume that δ ∼ δ0 It,δ 6= 0 and It,δ0 6= 0.
                                                                                  Et,κ

So ΣGδ       ;u0 ,ξ;bt,δ ,κ   6= 0. Hence by Theorem 4.4 for Gδ0 there exists a representative
        0
             Γ
   d
ξ ∈G γ0 of ξ such that the endoscopic datum E(u0 ,ξ) of Gδ0 is isomorphic to Et,κ .
10                         DAVID KAZHDAN AND YAKOV VARSHAVSKY

Therefore there exist embeddings η1 : G         d       d               b     d
                                                  γ0 ֒→ Gδ0 and η2 : T ֒→ Gδ0 such that
E(γ0 ,ξ,η1 ) = E(bt,δ0 ,κ,η2 ) (compare Notation 2.6) and η2 (κ) = zη1 (ξ) for a certain z ∈
Z(Gd       Γ
       δ0 ) . Moreover, z is defined up to multiplication by an element of Z(Et,κ ).
Therefore for all δ ∼ δ0 , the expression hinv(δ, δ0 ), zi is independent of the choice
                       Et,κ
of the ηi ’s.
Claim 4.17. For each δ ∼ δ0 we have It,δ = hinv(δ, δ0 ), ziIt,δ0 .
                               Et,κ

Proof. Since ΣGδ ;u0 ,ξ;bt,δ ,κ 6= 0, Theorem 4.4 for inner forms Gδ and Gδ0 implies that
                 0
for every stably conjugate u ∈ Gδ (E) of u0 ∈ Gδ0 (E), we have
                                               u, u0; ξ
                        ΣGδ ;u,ξ;bt,δ ,κ = h                 iΣ                   .
                                             bt,δ , bt,δ0 ; κ Gδ0 ;u0 ,ξ;bt,δ0 ,κ
Then γ := δu ∈ G(E) is stably conjugate to γ0 , and the assertion follows by direct
calculations from (4.3).                                                         
4.18. Now
        P we are ready to show the validity of (i),(ii)P
                                                       of Theorem 4.4.
  (i) As δ ∼ δ0 It,δ 6= 0, we get from Claim 4.17 that δ ∼ δ0 hinv(δ, δ0 ), zi =
                                                                               6 0. By
                Et,κ                                                       Et,κ

the definition of Et,κ -equivalence, this implies that z belongs to Z(Et,κ )Z(G)           b Γ . Thus
changing η1 (or η2 ), we can assume that z ∈ Z(G)           b Γ . Since (γ0 , ξ) and (bt,δ0 , κ) define
isomorphic endoscopic data of Gδ0 , we therefore conclude that E(γ0 ,ξ) ∼             = E(a0 ,κ) .
   (ii) Since T is elliptic, an element t ∈ T (E) is (G, a0 , γ0 )-relevant if and only if
it is (G′ , a′0 , γ0′ )-relevant. Thus it will suffice to show that for each such t we have
P                 γ0′ ,γ0 ;ξ P
   δ′ It,δ′ = h a′0 ,a0 ;κ i   δ It,δ . For every stably conjugate δ ∈ G(E) of δ0 , there exists a
stably conjugate δ ∈ G′ (E) of δ0′ such that δ ′ ∼ δ. Therefore it will suffice to show
                             ′
                                                        Et,κ
                               ′                               γ ′ ,γ ;ξ
that for every such pair δ ∼ δ, we have It,δ′ = h a′0,a00;κ iIt,δ . The latter equality can
                                   Et,κ                         0

be proved by the same arguments as Claim 4.17.
                                          Appendix A.
  Let G be a reductive group over E, E = (s, ρ) an elliptic endoscopic datum of
G, and ϕ : G → G′ an E-admissible inner twisting. To every two triples (a′i , ai ; κi ),
i = 1, 2, where ai : Ti ֒→ G and a′i : Ti ֒→ G′ are stably conjugate embeddings of

maximal tori, and κi is an element Tbi such that E(ai ,κi ) is isomorphic to E, we are

we can assume that G is semisimple and simply connected. Let T1,2 be the quotient

Definition A.1. Let E = (s, ρ) be an endoscopic datum of G, ϕ : G → G′ an
inner twisting, a : T ֒→ G an embedding of a maximal torus, and κ an element
of TbΓ such that E(a,κ) ∼  = E. We say that ϕ : G → G′ is (E, a, κ)-admissible, if
for all representatives κ′ ∈ TbΓ of κ ∈ π0 (TbΓ /Z(G)       b Γ ) satisfying E(a,κ′ ) ∼
                                                                                      = E, all

Remark A.2. a) Every (E, a, κ)-admissible inner twisting is E-admissible.
  b) If a(T ) ⊂ G is elliptic, then every E-admissible inner twisting is (E, a, κ)-
admissible.
