                                             1     Introduction
                                             Cherednik’s double affine Hecke algebras are an important class of algebras attached to root systems. They
                                             were introduced in [Che95] as a tool of proving Macdonald’s conjectures, but are also interesting by them-
                                             selves, since they provide universal deformations of twisted group algebras of double affine Weyl groups. One
                                             may distinguish rational, trigonometric, and elliptic Cherednik algebras, which contain 0, 1, and 2 copies of
                                             the root lattice, respectively (rational and trigonometric algebras are degenerations of the elliptic ones; see
                                             [EG02]).
                                                 Development of representation theory of Cherednik algebras (in particular, description of all irreducible
                                             finite dimensional representations) is an important open problem. In the characteristic zero case, it is solved
                                             completely only for type A, while in other types only partial results are available (see [EG02],[BEG03], and
                                             [CO] for the rank 1 case). In positive characteristic, the rank 1 case (in the more general setting of complex
                                             reflection groups) is settled by the author in [Lat], after which the higher rank case (of type A) was considered
                                             in [FG].
                                                 The goal of this paper is to extend the results of [Lat] to the trigonometric case. That is, we study the
                                             representation theory of trigonometric Cherednik algebras in positive characteristic p in the simplest case of
                                             rank 1. Our main result is a complete description of irreducible representations of such algebras.
                                                 The paper is organized as follows.
                                                 In Section 2, we state the main results.
                                                 In Section 3, we prove the results for the “classical” case, i.e. the case when the “Planck’s constant” t
                                             is zero. In this case, generic irreducible representations have dimension 2; one-dimensional representations
                                             exist when the “coupling constant” k is zero.
                                                 In Section 4, we prove the results for the “quantum” case, i.e. the case when the “Planck’s constant” t
                                             is nonzero. In this case, generic irreducible representations have dimension 2p; smaller representations exist
                                             when the “coupling constant” k is an element of Fp ⊂ k; namely, if k is an integer with 0 ≤ k ≤ p − 1, then
                                             there exist irreducible representations of dimensions p − k and p + k.

                                             Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p, where p 6= 2. Let t, k ∈ k, and let H(t, k) be the
                                             algebra (over k) generated by X, X−1 , s and y, subject to the following relations:

                                                   s2    = 1                                                     (2)

   We will classify the irreducible representations of H(t, k). Now, for t 6= 0, H(t, k) is clearly isomorphic
to H(1, kt ) under the map
                                                                   1

                                                                   t
Thus it is sufficient to classify irreducible representations of H(0, k) and H(1, k). For brevity we will use the
             def                 def
notation H0 = H(0, k) and H1 = H(1, k), assuming that k has been fixed once and for all.

3    Proof of Propositions 2.1 and 2.2
Lemma 3.1 (PBW for H0 , easy direction). The elements

                                          si Xj yl ,       j, l ∈ Z, l ≥ 0, i ∈ {0, 1}

span H0 over k.
Proof. Given a product of X, y, s, X−1 in any order, one can ensure that the y’s are to the right of all the X’s
by using yX = Xy − ksX repeatedly, and one can also ensure that the s’s are to the left of all the X’s and y’s
by using Xs = sX−1 and ys = −k − sy repeatedly.
Lemma 3.2. X + X−1 , y2 and Xy − yX−1 belong to the center Z(H0 ) of H0 .
Proof. First, let us show that y2 ∈ Z(H0 ). We have

                                      Xy2       = (yX + ksX)y
                                                = yXy + ksXy
                                                = y(yX + ksX) + ks(yX + ksX)
                                                = y2 X + k(ys + sy)X + k 2 s2 X
                                                = y2 X + −k 2 X + k 2 X
                                                = y2 X;

thus [X, y2 ] = 0. We also have

                           sy2   =   (−ys − k)y = −ysy − ky = −y(−ys − k) − ky = y2 s;



                                                                    7
thus [s, y2 ] = 0. It follows that y2 ∈ Z(H0 ). Next, we show that X + X−1 ∈ Z(H0 ). We have

                           y(X + X−1 ) = Xy − ksX + X−1 y + kX−1 s = (X + X−1 )y,

and
                                   s(X + X−1 ) = X−1 s + Xs = (X + X−1 )s.
Thus [y, X + X−1 ] = [s, X + X−1 ] = 0, and so X + X−1 ∈ Z(H0 ). Finally, we show that Xy − yX−1 ∈ Z(H0 ).
First we note that

                yX − X−1 y = yX + Xy − (X + X−1 )y = yX + Xy − y(X + X−1 )) = Xy − yX−1 ,

and thus
                               X(Xy − yX−1 ) = X(yX − X−1 y) = (Xy − yX−1 )X,
               y(Xy − yX−1 ) = y(yX − X−1 y) = y2 X − yX−1 y = Xy2 − yX−1 y = (Xy − yX−1 )y,
and

      s(Xy − yX−1 ) = s(yX − X−1 y) = −(ys + k)X − Xsy = −yX−1 s − kX + X(ys + k) = (Xy − yX−1 )s.

Thus Xy − yX−1 ∈ Z(H0 ).
Corollary 3.3. H0 is finitely generated as a module over its center.
Proof. From Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, we see that H0 is generated over its center by

                                          si Xj yl ,   i, j, l ∈ {0, 1}.



Corollary 3.4. Every irreducible H0 -module is finite-dimensional over k.
Proof. Standard.
    Thus Schur’s lemma implies that central elements of H0 act as scalars in any irreducible H0 -module.
    From this point, we will use the following notation: the eigenspace of y with eigenvalue β will be denoted
V [β].
Corollary 3.5. Let V be an irreducible H0 -module, and let β be an eigenvalue of y. Suppose β 6= 0. Then,

                                              V = V [β] ⊕ V [−β],

and dim V [β] = dim V [−β] = 1.
Proof. Suppose V [β] 6= 0, and let v ∈ V [β] be nonzero. From the proof of corollary 3.3, we know that V is
spanned by
                                               {v, Xv, sv, sXv}.
Now let w = sXv; then

                   yw = ysXv = −syXv − kXv = −sXyv + ks2 Xv − kXv = −βsXv = −βw.

Thus, w ∈ V [−β]. Clearly, w 6= 0, and thus V [−β] 6= 0. Now let v ′ = 2βXv − kw. Then,

                   yv ′ = 2βyXv + βkw = 2βXyv − 2kβsXv + βkw = 2β 2 Xv − βkw = βv ′ .

Hence, v ′ ∈ V [β]. Also, if w′ = kv + 2βsv, then

                    yw′ = kyv + 2βysv = βkv − 2βsyv − 2βkv = −βkv − 2βsyv = −βw′ ,

                                                       8
Hence, w′ ∈ V [−β]. From this it follows that

                                                      V = V [β] ⊕ V [−β].

Now let H0 be the subalgebra of H0 generated by Z(H0 ) and 2βX − ksX. It is clear that V [β] = Hv.
Since this is true for all nonzero v ∈ V [β], it follows that V [β] is an irreducible representation of H0 . Since
H0 is commutative, we see that V [β] is one dimensional. The same holds for V [−β], and the corollary is
proved.
Corollary 3.6. Assume k 6= 0. Let V be an irreducible H0 -module, and suppose 0 is an eigenvalue of y.
Then, V = Vgen [0], the generalized eigenspace of 0. We also have dim V = 2 and dim V [0] = 1.
Proof. Let v ∈ V [0] be nonzero. From the proof of corollary 3.3, we know that V is spanned by

                                                        {v, Xv, sv, sXv}.

Let w = −sv; then,
                                             yw = −ysv = syv + kv = kv.
     ′            −1
Let v = sXv = X        sv; then,

                               yv ′ = yX−1 sv = X−1 ysv + kX−1 s2 v = −X−1 syv = 0.

Let w′ = −Xv = −sv ′ ; then, as above, we have yw′ = v ′ .
   So we have
                                 yv = 0, yw = kv, yv ′ = 0,                 yw′ = kv ′ ;
therefore, V = Vgen [0] and V [0] is spanned by v and v ′ . Now let H0 be the subalgebra of H0 generated by
Z(H0 ) and sX. It is clear that V [0] = Hv. Since this is true for all nonzero v ∈ V [0], it follows that V [0]
is an irreducible representation of H0 . Since H0 is commutative, we see that V [0] is one dimensional. The
corollary follows from this.
Corollary 3.7. Assume k = 0. Let V be an irreducible H0 -module, and suppose 0 is an eigenvalue of y.
Then,
                                           V = V [0],
the eigenspace of 0. We also have
                                             (
                                                 1    if 1 or − 1 is an eigenvalue of X
                                   dim V =
                                                 2    otherwise.


Proof. From the proof of corollary 3.6, we see that y acts on V as the zero operator. Let λ be an eigenvalue
of X, let VX [λ] denote the associated eigenspace and let v ∈ VX [λ] be nonzero. From the proof of corollary
3.3, we know that V is spanned by {v, sv}. Now

                                                     Xsv = sX−1 v = λ−1 sv,

so sv ∈ VX [λ−1 ]. Clearly, sv 6= 0; thus, if λ 6= ±1, then

                                      V = VX [λ] ⊕ VX [λ−1 ]        and dim V = 2.

If λ = ±1, it follows that X and s commute as operators on V ; since V is irreducible, this implies that
dim V = 1.

Proof of Proposition 2.1. Let β 6= 0, and let V be a two-dimensional representation of H0 in which V [β] and
V [−β] both have dimension 1. Let v0 ∈ V [β], v1 ∈ V [−β] be nonzero. Let the matrices representing s and
X with respect to the basis {v0 , v1 } be as follows:

                                            γ0 δ 0              θ0 ω 0
                                     s 7→              , X 7→            .
                                            γ1 δ 1              θ1 ω 1
First, we note that X and y cannot have a common eigenvector; for if Xw = γw and yw = β ′ w, then
ksw = XyX−1 w − yw = 0, and combining this with s2 = 1 gives w = 0. Hence, by scaling, we can assume
that ω0 = 1.
   Now the central element Xy − yX−1 acts on V as a scalar. The matrix representation of Xy − yX−1 is
                            β
                                                      − detβ X (det X − 1)
                                                                               
                              det X (θ0 det X − ω1 )                             .

                                det X (det X − 1)    − detβ X (θ0 det X − θ0 )

    Thus, 0 = − detβ X (det X − 1), which means that det X = 1. Hence,
                                                     θ1 = θ0 ω1 − 1.                                               (79)
   Using (4), we see that XyX−1 − y − ks = 0. Using (79), we see that the matrix yrepresentation of
XyX−1 − y − ks is                                                    

    Using (2), we see that s2 = 1. Using (80)–(83), we see that the matrix representation of s2 is
                                                                            !

Thus,

                                                          β,θ0
    Using (79)–(84), we see that V is isomorphic to V0,1       . Furthermore, it is easy to see that for all a, β ∈
             β,a
k \ {0}, V0,1    is a representation of H0 ; furthermore, each eigenvector of y clearly generates H0 , and thus
  β,θ0
V0,1   is irreducible.
                                      β,a                                                                    β,a
    Now the eigenvalues of y in V0,1      are β and −β, and 2β(Xy − yX−1 ) − 2β 2 (X + X−1 ) acts on V0,1        as
k2 −4β 2                       k                      β,a                                      β,a         ′
                                                                                                         β ,a  ′

    a      Id, while for β =   2,   X + X−1 acts on V0,1  as a Id. From this it follows that V0,1  and V0,1   are
                                                                       2   2
isomorphic if and only if β = β, a′ = a or β ′ = −β, a′ = 4β4aβ

    Now let V be a two-dimensional representation of H0 in which V [0] has dimension 1 and Vgen [0] has
dimension 2. Let v0 , v1 ∈ V be nonzero elements such that yv0 = 0, yv1 = v0 . Let the matrices representing
s and X with respect to the basis {v0 , v1 } be as follows:
                                                                     
                                            γ0 δ 0               θ0 ω 0
                                   s 7→                , X 7→             .
                                            γ1 δ 1               θ1 ω 1

                                                               10
Now the matrix representation of sy + ys + k is
                                                                     
                                             γ1 + k        γ0 + δ 1
                                                                          .
                                                0          γ1 + k

(3) thus implies that γ1 = −k and γ0 = −δ1 . Scaling, we may assume that γ0 = 1. Next, we note that
s2 − 1 acts on V as −δ0 k Id; (2) thus implies that δ0 = 0. We then see that the matrix representation of
Xy − yX − ksX is                                                    
                                       −θ1 − kθ0     θ0 − ω1 − kω0
                                                                       .
                                      k(kθ0 + θ1 ) θ1 + k 2 ω0 + kω1
(4) thus implies that θ1 = −kθ0 , θ0 = ω1 + kω0 . Finally, the matrix representation of XsX − s is

                                             θ02 − 1
                                                                  
                                                              0
                                                                     .
                                           −k(θ02 − 1) −θ02 + 1

(4) thus implies that θ0 = ±1.
                              θ0 ,ω0                            a,b
    Thus V is isomorphic to V0,2     . It is easy to see that V0,2  is indeed a representation of H0 ; furthermore,
                                                              a,b                                             a,b
each eigenvector of y clearly generates H0 , and thus V0,2 is irreducible. Now X + X−1 acts on V0,2               as
                                                                               ′   ′

(2a − kb) Id, while Xy − yX−1 acts as −ak Id . Therefore, V0,2  and V0,2   are isomorphic if and only if
 ′      ′
a = a, b = b.
Proof of Proposition 2.2. Let β 6= 0, and let V be a two-dimensional representation of H0 in which V [β] and
V [−β] both have dimension 1. Let v0 ∈ V [β], v1 ∈ V [−β] be nonzero. Let the matrices representing s and
X with respect to the basis {v0 , v1 } be as follows:
                                                                    
                                            γ0 δ 0              θ0 ω 0
                                     s 7→              , X 7→            .
                                            γ1 δ 1              θ1 ω 1

First, we note thet X and y commute, so they must have a common eigenvector; for the moment, let us
assume that ω0 = 0.
   Now the central element Xy − yX−1 acts on V as a scalar. The matrix representation of Xy − yX−1 is
                             β                                                
                              det X (θ0 det X − ω1 )              0
                                                                                 .
                                 βθ1
                                det X (det X − 1)    − detβ X (ω1 det X − θ0 )
                βθ1
   Thus, 0 =   det X (det X   − 1), which means that det X = 1. Hence,

                                                          1
                                                   ω1 =      .                                                 (85)
                                                          θ0

   Using (4), we see that XyX−1 − y = 0. Using (85), we see that the matrix representation of XyX−1 − y is
                                             
                                                   0   0
                                                         
                                                2β         .
                                                θ 0 θ1 0

Hence, θ1 = 0. (If we had assumed earlier that θ1 = 0, here we would get ω0 = 0.)
   Using (1), we see that ys + sy = 0. Using (85), we see that the matrix representation of ys + sy is
                                                            
                                               2βγ0     0
                                                                .
                                                0     −2βδ1

   Then we must have γ0 = δ1 = 0, and thus s2 acts on V as δ0 γ1 Id . Using (2), we see that s2 = 1; thus
                                                                          β,θ0                      β,a
δ0 = γ11 . By scaling, we may assume that γ1 = 1, and we see that V = V0,3     . It is clear that V0,3  is an

β ′ = −β, a′ = a1 .
    Now let V be a two-dimensional representation of H0 in which y acts as zero and X has eigenvalues λ
and λ−1 , with λ 6= ±1. Let v0 ∈ VX [λ], v1 ∈ VX [λ−1 ] be nonzero. Let the matrix representing s with respect

                                                       γ0 δ 0
                                              s 7→               .
                                                       γ1 δ 1
    Using (1), we see that Xs − sX−1 = 0. But the matrix representation of Xs − sX−1 is
                                                2
                                                               !
                                            γ0 λ λ−1    0
                                                          2      .
                                               0     −δ1 λ λ−1

Since λ 6= ±1, we see that γ0 = δ1 = 0. Thus s2 acts on V as γ1 δ0 Id. Using (2), we see that s2 = 1. Hence,
δ0 = γ11 . By scaling, we may assume that γ1 = δ0 = 1. Thus V must be isomorphic to V0,4  λ
                                                                                            . It is clear that
                                                                         ′
   a                                                       a         a
V0,4  is an irreducible representation of H0 and that V0,4    and V0,4 are isomorphic if and only if a′ = a or
 ′     1
a = a.
     Finally, the classification of one-dimensional representations of H0 is trivial.


4     Proof of Propositions 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5
Lemma 4.1 (PBW for H1 , easy direction). The elements
                                     si Xj yl ,   j, l ∈ Z, l ≥ 0, i ∈ {0, 1}
span H1 over k.
Proof. Similar to the proof of lemma 3.1.
Lemma 4.2. Xp + X−p and (yp − y)2 belong to the center Z(H1 ) of H1 .
Proof. First, let us show that Xp + X−p ∈ Z(H1 ). We have
                  y(Xp + X−p ) =      y(X + X−1 )p
                                 =    (Xy + X − ksX + X−1 y − X−1 + kX−1 s)(X + X−1 )p−1
                                 =    (X + X−1 )y(Xp−1 + X−p+1 ) + (X − X−1 )(X + X−1 )p−1
                                 =    ···
                                 =    (X + X−1 )p y + p(X − X−1 )(X + X−1 )p−1
                                 =    (Xp + X−p )y;
thus [y, Xp + X−p ] = 0. We also have
                                           sXp = X−p s,        sX−p = Xp s;
thus [s, Xp + X−p ] = 0. It follows that Xp + X−p ∈ Z(H1 ). Next, we show that (yp − y)2 ∈ Z(H1 ). We have
                    X(y + 1)2   =    Xy2 + 2Xy + X
                                =    (yX − X + ksX)y + 2Xy + X
                                =    y(yX − X + ksX) − Xy + ks(yX − X + ksX) + 2Xy + X
                                =    y2 X + k(ys + sy + k)X + (Xy − yX + X − ksX)
                                =    y2 X.
So X(y + 1)2 = y2 X, and thus Xg(y + 1) = g(y)X for all even polynomials g. In particular, [X, (yp − y)2 ] = 0.
Furthermore, we have [s, y2 ] = 0 (for the same reason as in the case t = 0). It follows that (yp − y)2 ∈
Z(H1 ).

Corollary 4.3. H1 is finitely generated as a module over its center.
Proof. From Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2, we see that H1 is generated over its center by

               si Xj yl ,   i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {−p + 1, −p + 2, . . . , p − 1, p}, l ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 2p − 1},



Corollary 4.4. Every irreducible H1 -module is finite-dimensional over k.
Proof. Standard.
   Consider the following elements of H1 :

                                                 def                   k
                                              A = sX,       B = sy +     .
                                                                       2
These elements were introduced by Cherednik in [Che97] and are called intertwiners. We note that B is also
equal to −ys − k2 .
Lemma 4.5.
                                                                        k2
                                            A2 = 1,      B2 = −y2 +        .

Proof. We have
                                             A2 = sXsX = ssX−1 X = 1

Proof. We have
                      Ay = sXy = s(yX − X + ksX) = −ysX − kX − sX + kX = (−y − 1)A,

Corollary 4.7. Let V be a representation of H1 . Then

                                                A : V [β] → V [β − 1]

is an isomorphism and
                                                  B : V [β] → V [β]
is a homomorphism. B is an isomorphism if and only if β 6= ± k2 . The same result holds for generalized
eigenspaces.
Lemma 4.8. Let V be an irreducible representation of H1 on which the central element (yp − y)2 acts as
b 6= 0. Then
                                V ⊃ ⊕c∈Fp (V [µ + c] ⊕ V [−µ + c]) ,
where µ is a root of the equation (µp − µ)2 = b. Each eigenspace has dimension 1.



                                                           13
Proof. Let µ be an eigenvalue of y, and let v ∈ V [µ]. Note that bv = (yp − y)2 v = (µp − µ)2 v, so we have
(µp − µ)2 = b. By corollary 4.7, we have the following homomorphisms:
       A             B            A                 B          A    A                 B              A
 V [µ] → V [−µ−1] → V [µ+1] → V [−µ−2] → V [µ+2] → · · · → V [−µ−p+1] → V [µ+p−1] → V [−µ]. (86)

If none of the eigenvalues in (86) is equal to k2 , then all of the homomorphisms in (86) are isomorphisms (by
corollary 4.7). Otherwise, we may assume without loss of generality that µ = k2 , and once again all of the
homomorphisms in (86) are isomorphisms. Thus, dim V ≥ 2p dim V [µ]. Now the dimension of the algebra
H1 /(Xp + X−p = a, (yp − y)2 = b) acting irreducibly on V is at most 8p2 (see the proof of corollary 4.3).
Hence, 4p2 (dim V [µ])2 = (dim V )2 ≤ 8p2 , which implies that dim V [µ] = 1. The result follows.
Lemma 4.9. Suppose k ∈    / Fp . Let V be an irreducible representation of H1 on which the central element
(yp − y)2 acts as 0. Then each generalized eigenspace Vgen [c], c ∈ Fp has dimension 2.
Proof. Let µ be an eigenvalue of y, and let v ∈ V [µ]. Note that 0 = (yp − y)2 v = (µp − µ)2 v, so we have
µp − µ = 0. Hence, µ ∈ Fp . By corollary 4.7, we have the following homomorphisms:
                             BA                BA              BA   BA               BA
                     Vgen [µ] → Vgen [µ + 1] → Vgen [µ + 2] → · · · → Vgen [µ − 1] → Vgen [µ].                 (87)

Since k ∈/ Fp , none of the eigenvalues in (87) is equal to ± k2 . By corollary 4.7, all of the homomorphisms in
(87) are isomorphisms, and the eigenvalues of y are precisely the elements of Fp . Thus, dim V = p dim Vgen [0].
Now the dimension of the algebra H1 /(Xp + X−p = a, (yp − y)2 = 0) acting irreducibly on V is at most 8p2
(see the proof of corollary 4.3). Hence, p2 (dim Vgen [0])2 = (dim V )2 ≤ 8p2 , which implies that dim Vgen [0] ≤ 2.
Now let v ∈ V [0]; then
                                             ysv = −syv − kv = −kv.
Since k 6= 0, we conclude that sv ∈ Vgen [0] \ V [0]. Therefore, dim Vgen [0] = 2, and the result follows.
Proof of Proposition 2.3. It is easy to show that if µ and d satisfy the conditions in the statement of Propo-
                   µ,d                                                    µ,d
sition 2.3, then V1,1  is a representation of H1 . Furthermore, if v ∈ V1,1   is an eigenvector of y, we see that we
                       µ,d                                            µ,d
can generate all of V1,1 by applying A and B. This implies that V1,1 is actually an irreducible representation
                                      θ
of H1 . The same can be said of V1,2    .
    Let V be an irreducible representation of H1 , and suppose that (yp − y)2 acts on V as b 6= 0. For the
moment, let us assume that ± k2 are not eigenvalues of y. Let vµ be an eigenvector of y with eigenvalue µ,
and let

                                       vµ+j   = (BA)j vµ , j = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1
                                      v−µ+j   = A(BA)j−1 vµ , j = 1, 2, . . . , p.

Note that Bv−µ ∈ V [µ]; using lemma 4.8, we see that Bv−µ = dvµ , where d ∈ k is nonzero. From this we
                                               µ,d                                                     µ,d
can deduce that (5)–(10) are satisfied. Thus V1,1  ⊂ V. By irreducibility of V , it follows that V = V1,1  .
                                                                                             2           
                       p                                                             1       k          2
                                                                                       Q
Now we note that (BA) acts as d Id on V [µ], V [µ + 1], . . . , V [µ + p − 1] and as d c∈Fp 4 − (µ + c)
                                                                                             ′   ′

on V [−µ], V [−µ + 1], . . . , V [−µ + p − 1]. From this we can deduce that V1,1  and V1,1   are isomorphic if
                                                                             2            
and only if (µ − µ ∈ Fp and d = d) or (µ + µ ∈ Fp and dd = c∈Fp 4 − (µ + c) ). Now, if ± k2 are
                                                                             k           2

                                                                     Q

eigenvalues of y, then B2 acts as zero on V [± k2 ], so either B acts as zero on V [ k2 ], in which case we can use
the above argument with µ = k2 , or B acts as zero on V [ k2 ], in which case we can use the above argument
with µ = − k2 .




                                                          14
   Second, suppose that (yp − y)2 acts on V as 0. Let v0 be an eigenvector of y with eigenvalue 0, and let
                                                                                 p−1

Since A maps eigenspaces to eigenspaces and generalized eigenspaces to generalized eigenspaces, and since
A2 = 1, we can use lemma 4.9 to conclude that

                               Av p−1 = θv p−1 ,          Aw p−1 = ωw p−1 ,                   θ, ω = ±1.

From this we can deduce that (11)–(20) are satisfied, as well as

                                                        Xw p−1 = ωsw p−1                                       (88)
                                                              2              2


Now we know from (4) that
                                                 (Xy − yX + X − ksX)w p−1                                      (89)
                                                                                      2

must be zero. Using (11)–(20) and (88), we see that the coefficient of v p−1 in Xyw p−1 , −yXw p−1 , Xw p−1 and
                                                                          2          2          2        2
−ksXw p−1 are respectively k(θ − ω), 0, 2kω and 0. From (89), we get k(θ + ω) = 0, which implies ω = −θ.
        2

Hence (22) is also satisfied. Thus Vθ1,2 ⊂ V. By irreducibility of V , it follows that V = V1,2
                                                                                             θ
                                                                                                . Since A acts on
  θ   p−1                                                  θ        θ ′
V1,2 [ 2 ] through multiplication by θ, it is clear that V1,2 and V1,2  are isomorphic if and only if θ = θ′ .

Let us assume that V k2 = 0. Since V 6= 0, we must have V [0] 6= 0. Let u ∈ V [0] be nonzero; then
                        

ysu = −syu − ku = −ku. This means Vgen [0] \ V [0] is nonempty. From  the isomorphisms (90), we know that
there exist v, w ∈ V such that yv = − k2 v, yw = − k2 w + v. Since V k2 = 0, we see that Bv = Bw = 0. Thus,

Lemma 4.11. Let V be an irreducible representation of H1 , and suppose that B : V [ k2 ] → V [− k2 ] is zero but
V [ k2 ] 6= 0. Then

Proof. Let
                                            k      k                   k

Since V is irreducible, it is enough to show that W is a subrepresentation. Since B acts as zero on V [ k2 ], we
see that W is closed under the action of A and B. Clearly, yW ⊂ W . For v ∈ V [β], β 6= 0, we have
                                                                            

                            Bv = sy +        v = βsv + v; so sv = β       B−     v.

So sW ⊂ W . Finally, X = sA, so XW ⊂ W , and the proof is complete.
                                                                                  µ,d
Proof of Proposition 2.4. As in the proof of Proposition 2.3, we see that V1,1        is an irreducible representation
of H1 whenever µ and d satisfy the conditions in the statement of Proposition 2.4. Similarly, for θ = ±1,
  θ                                                               c         c
V1,3 is an irreducible representation of H1 and for c ∈ k, V1,4      and V1,5  are irreducible representations of H1 .
    Now, let V be an irreducible representation of H1 , and suppose that that (yp − y)2 acts on V as b. Here
k ∈ Fp , so if b 6= 0, then k2 is not a root of f (y) = (y p − y)2 − b, so the argument in the proof of Proposition
                   µ,d
2.3 applies for V1,1   . We will now assume that b = 0.
    Now suppose B acts as zero on V [ k2 ]. Let H1 be the subalgebra of H1 generated by A and B. From the
proof of Lemma 4.11, we see that V = H1 v for any eigenvector of v of y. Since A2 = 1 and B2 acts as a
scalar on each eigenspace, it follows that V is spanned by
                                     v, Av, BAv, ABAv, . . . , Bv, ABv, BABv, . . .
for each eigenvector v of y. If the eigenvalue of v is k2 , we conclude, from corollary 4.7 and from the fact that
B acts as zero on V [ k2 ], that
                                         k
                                      V [ ] is spanned by v, A(BA)p−k−1 v.                                    (91)
                                         2
Let H1 be the subalgebra of H1 generated by A(BA)p−k−1 . Clearly, H1 is commutative, and since (91) holds
for all nonzero v ∈ V [ k2 ], we conclude that V [ k2 ] is an irreducible representation of H. By Schur’s Lemma,
A(BA)p−k−1 acts on V [ k2 ] as a scalar, and thus dim V [ k2 ] = 1. We then let v k ∈ V [ k2 ] be nonzero, and let
                                                                                      2


                                                                            p−1 k
                              v− k −j = A(BA)j−1 v,      j = 1, 2, . . . ,     − ;

                                                                            p−1 k
                                     v k +j = (BA)j v,    j = 1, 2, . . . ,    − .
                                      2                                      2   2
Now Av p−1 = θv p−1 for some θ, and A2 = 1 implies θ = ±1. From the above information, we can deduce
          2         2
                                          θ                                                          θ
that (23)–(28) are satisfied, and thus V1,3    ⊂ V . By irreducibility of V , we conclude that V = V1,3 . Since A
            p−1                                                  θ         θ ′
acts on V [ 2 ] through multiplication by θ, it follows that V1,3 and V1,3 are isomorphic if and only if θ = θ′ .
   Now suppose B does not act as zero on V [ k2 ]. Let v0 be an eigenvector of y with eigenvalue 0, and let
w0 = − k1 sv0 . Then yw0 = v0 . For j = 0, . . . , k2 − 1, let

                                                   vj    = (BA)j v0

                                              v−j−1      = −A(BA)j v0
                                              w−j−1      = A(BA)j w0 .

                                                          16
It is easy to check that for each j, vj and v−j−1 are eigenvectors of y with eigenvalue j, −j − 1 respectively,
and ywj = jwj + vj , yw−j−1 = (−j − 1)w−j−1 + v−j−1 . Now Bv− k = 0, and
                                                                                                                2

                                     2                2


                                     W = spank {v0 , v1 , . . . , vp−1 , w− k , w− k +1 , . . . , w k −1 }.
                                                                                                   2        2                   2

                                                                                             c
From the above information, we can deduce that (29)–(42) are satisfied. Therefore, V1,4         ⊂ V. Since V is
                                      c                                c   p−1                   c        c′
                                                                              
irreducible, we conclude that V = V1,4  . Since A acts as c Id on V1,4      2    , we see that V1,4 and V1,4 are
isomorphic if and only if c = c′ .
    Second, suppose that Av p−1 is not a scalar multiple of v p−1 . In this case, we may write Av p−1 = u p−1 ,
                              2                                2                                     2       2
and then
                                                                                                      p−1−k
                                     u p−1 +j         = −B(AB)j−1 u p−1 ,                              j = 1, . . . ,
                                          2                                            2                  2
                                                                                                  p−1−k
                                     u p−1 −j         = (AB)j u p−1                j = 1, . . . ,       .
                                          2                                 2                       2
Since {v p−1 , u p−1 } is linearly independent, it follows that {vj , uj } is linearly independent for all j = k2 , k2 +
           2       2
1, . . . , − k2 − 1. Now let

                       W = spank {v0 , v1 , . . . , vp−1 , w− k , w− k +1 , . . . , w k −1 , u k , u k +1 , . . . , u− k −1 }.
                                                                        2          2                        2           2   2       2


Now, we know from lemma 4.9 that dim Vgen [− k2 ] = 2, and this forces Bu k = cv− k for some c ∈ k. From the
                                                                             2       2
                                                                                c
above information, we can deduce that (43)–(60) are satisfied. Therefore, V1,5    ⊂ V. Since V is irreducible, we
                                                                                               c′
                       c
                         . Since B(AB)p−k acts as c Id on V1,5
                                                            c
                                                                 − k2 , we see that V1,5
                                                                                      c
                                                                    
conclude that V = V1,5                                                                   and V1,5 are isomorphic
                    ′
if and only if c = c .
Lemma 4.12. Suppose k = 0. Let V be an irreducible representation of H1 on which the central element
(yp − y)2 acts as 0. Then each eigenspace V [c], c ∈ Fp has dimension at most 2.




                                                                                  17
Proof. Let µ be an eigenvalue of y, and let v ∈ V [µ]. Note that 0 = (yp − y)2 v = (µp − µ)2 v, so we have
µp − µ = 0. Hence, µ ∈ Fp . By corollary 4.7, we have the following homomorphisms:
                                                                                   
                            iA          B          A       A        p+1 B         p−1
                   Vgen [0] → Vgen [−1] → Vgen [1] → · · · → Vgen        → Vgen         .             (92)
                                                                     2             2

Since k = 0, corollary 4.7 implies that all of the homomorphisms in (92) are isomorphisms, and the eigenvalues
of y are precisely the elements of Fp . Thus, dim V ≥ p dim V [0]. Now the dimension of the algebra H1 /(Xp +
X−p = a, (yp − y)2 = 0) acting irreducibly on V is at most 8p2 (see the proof of corollary 4.3). Hence,
p2 (dim V [0])2 ≤ (dim V )2 ≤ 8p2 , which implies that dim V [0] ≤ 2.
                                                                               µ,d
Proof of Proposition 2.5. As in the proof of Proposition 2.3, we see that V1,1     is an irreducible representation
of H1 whenever µ and d satisfy the conditions in the statement of Proposition 2.5. Similarly, for c, θ = ±1,
   c,θ                                                                 c,a
V1,6   is an irreducible representation of H1 and for c = ±1, a ∈ k, V1,7  is an irreducible representation of H1 .
     Now, let V be an irreducible representation of H1 , and suppose that that (yp − y)2 acts on V as b. If
b 6= 0, then k is not a root of f (y) = (y p − y)2 − b, so the argument in the proof of Proposition 2.3 applies
        µ,d
for V1,1    . We will now assume that b = 0. First we note that sy = −ys, which means that sV [0] ⊂ V [0]. Now
let v0 ∈ V [0] be an eigenvector of s. Since s2 = 1, we have sv0 = cv0 , where c = ±1. Let
                                                                                      p−1
                                  v−j        =     A(BA)j−1 v0 ,      j = 1, 2, . . . ,   ;
                                                                                        2
                                                                                   p−1
                                    vj       =     (BA)j v0 ,    j = 1, 2, . . . ,     .
                                                                                    2
   Now there are two cases:
   First, suppose that Av p−1 = θv p−1 for some θ ∈ k. Since A2 = 1, we see that θ = ±1. Now let
                             2           2


                                                 W = spank {v0 , v1 , . . . , vp−1 }.
                                                                                        c,θ
From the above information, we can deduce that (61)–(66) are satisfied. Therefore, V1,6     ⊂ V. Since V is
                                    c,θ                                                p−1 
irreducible, we conclude that V = V1,6 . Since s acts on V [0] as c Id and A acts on V 2 as θ Id, we see
                  ′   ′
       c,θ       c ,θ
that V1,6  and V1,6   are isomorphic if and only if c = c′ and θ = θ′ .
   Second, suppose that Av p−1 is not a scalar multiple of v p−1 . In this case, we may write Av p−1 = u p−1 ,
                              2                                 2                                 2       2
and then
                                                                                        p−3
                                 u p−1 +j        = B(AB)j−1 u p−1 ,         j = 1, . . . ,
                                    2                                 2                    2
                                                                                     p−1
                                 u p−1 −j        = (AB)j u p−1        j = 1, . . . ,     .
                                    2                           2                     2
Since {v p−1 , u p−1 } is linearly independent, it follows that {vj , uj } is linearly independent for all j. Hence,
          2       2
by lemma 4.12, V [0] = spank {v0 , u0 }, and this forces su0 = av0 + ru0 for some a, r ∈ k. Now

                                 u0 = s2 u0 = asv0 + rsu0 = acv0 + arv0 + r2 u0 .

Thus r = ±1. Now if c = r, then a = 0. But then v0 − u0 is an eigenvector of s and A acts on v p−1 − u p−1
                                                                                                       2     2
as a scalar, and so the first case shows us that V has a p-dimensional subrepresentation, contradicting V ’s
irreducibility. So we may assume that c = −r; a is then arbitrary. Now we can see that the eigenvalues of s
acting on V [0] are ±c; that is, ±1. This means that we can assume c = 1. From all this information, we can
                                                     a                                                       a
deduce that (67)–(78) are satisfied. Therefore, V1,7   ⊂ V. Since V is irreducible, we conclude that V = V1,7  .
                                            p−1            a        a′                                    ′
Finally, a is the coefficient of v in sA(BA)    v; thus, V1,7 and V1,7 are isomorphic if and only if a = a .
