                                            1. Introduction. Idempotent Mathematics is based on replacing the usual arith-
                                            metic operations by a new set of basic operations (e.g., such as maximum or mini-
                                            mum), that is on replacing numerical fields by idempotent semirings and semifields.
                                            Typical (and the most common) examples are given by the so-called (max, +) al-
                                            gebra Rmax and (min, +) algebra Rmin . Let R be the field of real numbers. Then
                                            Rmax = R ∪ {−∞} with operations x ⊕ y = max{x, y} and x ⊙ y = x + y. Similarly
                                            Rmin = R ∪ {+∞} with the operations ⊕ = min, ⊙ = +. The new addition ⊕
                                            is idempotent, i.e., x ⊕ x = x for all elements x. Idempotent Mathematics can be
                                            treated as a result of a dequantization of the traditional mathematics over numeri-
                                            cal fields as the Planck constant ~ tends to zero taking pure imaginary values. Some
                                            problems that are nonlinear in the traditional sense turn out to be linear over a suit-
                                            able idempotent semiring (idempotent superposition principle [1]). For example,
                                            the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (which is an idempotent version of the Schrödinger
                                            equation) is linear over Rmin and Rmax .
                                                The basic paradigm is expressed in terms of an idempotent correspondence prin-
                                            ciple [2].This principle is similar to the well-known correspondence principle of
                                            N. Bohr in quantum theory (and closely related to it). Actually, there exists a
                                            heuristic correspondence between important, interesting and useful constructions
                                            and results of the traditional mathematics over fields and analogous constructions
                                            and results over idempotent semirings and semifields (i.e., semirings and semifields
                                            with idempotent addition).
                                                A systematic and consistent application of the idempotent correspondence prin-
                                            ciple leads to a variety of results, often quite unexpected. As a result, in parallel
                                            with the traditional mathematics over rings, its “shadow”, the Idempotent Mathe-
                                            matics, appears. This “shadow” stands approximately in the same relation to the
                                            traditional mathematics as classical physics to quantum theory. In many respects
                                            Idempotent Mathematics is simpler than the traditional one. However, the tran-
                                            sition from traditional concepts and results to their idempotent analogs is often
                                            nontrivial.
                                                There is an idempotent version of the theory of linear representations of groups.
                                            We shall present some basic concepts and results of the idempotent representation
                                            theory. In the framework of this theory the well-known Legendre transform can be
                                            treated as an Rmax -version of the traditional Fourier transform (this observation

is due to V.P. Maslov). We shall discuss some unexpected theorems of the Engel
type.
   In this paper we present the so-called algebraic approach to Idempotent Mathe-
matics: basic notions and results are ‘simulated’ in pure algebraic terms. Historical
surveys and the corresponding references can be found in [2–6].
2. Semirings, semifields, and idempotent dequantization. Consider a set
S equipped with two algebraic operations: addition ⊕ and multiplication ⊙. It is a
semiring if the following conditions are satisfied:
     • the addition ⊕ and the multiplication ⊙ are associative;
     • the addition ⊕ is commutative;
     • the multiplication ⊙ is distributive with respect to the addition ⊕: x ⊙ (y ⊕
       z) = (x ⊙ y) ⊕ (x ⊙ z) and (x ⊕ y) ⊙ z = (x ⊙ z) ⊕ (y ⊙ z) for all x, y, z ∈ S.
A unity of a semiring S is an element 1 ∈ S such that 1 ⊙ x = x ⊙ 1 = x for all
x ∈ S. A zero of a semiring S is an element 0 ∈ S such that 0 6= 1 and 0 ⊕ x = x,
0 ⊙ x = x ⊙ 0 = 0 for all x ∈ S. A semiring S is called an idempotent semiring if
x ⊕ x = x for all x ∈ S. A semiring S with neutral elements 0 and 1 is called a
semifield if every nonzero element of S is invertible.
    Let R be the field of real numbers and R+ the semiring of all nonnegative real
numbers (with respect to the usual addition and multiplication). The change of
variables x 7→ u = h ln x, h > 0, defines a map Φh : R+ → S = R ∪ {−∞}.
Let the addition and multiplication operations be mapped from R to S by Φh ,
i.e., let u ⊕h v = h ln(exp(u/h) + exp(v/h)), u ⊙ v = u + v, 0 = −∞ = Φh (0),
1 = 0 = Φh (1). It can easily be checked that u ⊕h v → max{u, v} as h → 0 and
S forms a semiring with respect to addition u ⊕ v = max{u, v} and multiplication
u ⊙ v = u + v with zero 0 = −∞ and unit 1 = 0. Denote this semiring by
Rmax ; it is idempotent, i.e., u ⊕ u = u for all its elements. The semiring Rmax is
actually a semifield. The analogy with quantization is obvious; the parameter h
plays the rôle of the Planck constant, so R+ (or R) can be viewed as a “quantum
object” and Rmax as the result of its “dequantization”. A similar procedure gives
the semiring Rmin = R ∪ {+∞} with the operations ⊕ = min, ⊙ = +; in this
case 0 = +∞, 1 = 0. The semirings Rmax and Rmin are isomorphic. Connections
with physics and imaginary values of the Planck constant are discussed below. The
idempotent semiring R ∪ {−∞} ∪ {+∞} with the operations ⊕ = max, ⊙ = min
can be obtained as a result of a “second dequantization” of R (or R+ ). Dozens of
interesting examples of nonisomorphic idempotent semirings may be cited as well
as a number of standard methods of deriving new semirings from these (see, e.g.,
[2–6] and below).
    Idempotent dequantization is related to logarithmic transformations that were
used in the classical papers of E. Schrödinger [7] and E. Hopf [8]. The subsequent
progress of E. Hopf’s ideas has culminated in the well-known vanishing viscosity
method (the method of viscosity solutions), see, e.g., [9].
3. Idempotent Analysis. Let S be an arbitrary semiring with idempotent ad-
dition ⊕ (which is always assumed to be commutative), multiplication ⊙, zero 0,
and unit 1. The set S is supplied with the standard partial order 4: by definition,
a 4 b if and only if a ⊕ b = b. Thus all elements of S are positive: 0 4 a for all
a ∈ S. Due to the existence of this order, Idempotent Analysis is closely related
to lattice theory, the theory of vector lattices, and the theory of ordered spaces.
                                          2
Moreover, this partial order allows to model a number of basic notions and results
of Idempotent Analysis at the purely algebraic level; in this paper we develop this
line of reasoning systematically. Let us notice that the standard partial order can
be defined for an arbitrary commutative semigroup with idempotent addition.
   Calculus deals mainly with functions whose values are numbers. The idempotent
analog of a numerical function is a map X → S, where X is an arbitrary set and
S is an idempotent semiring. Functions with values in S can be added, multiplied
by each other, and multiplied by elements of S.
   The idempotent analog of a linear functional space is a set of S-valued functions
that is closed under addition of functions and multiplication of functions by elements
of S, or an S-semimodule. Consider, e.g., the S-semimodule B(X, S) of functions
X → S that are bounded in the sense of the standard order on S.
   If S = Rmax , then the idempotent analog of integration is defined by the formula
                                         Z     ⊕
(1)                             I(ϕ) =               ϕ(x) dx = sup ϕ(x),
                                             X                x∈X

                                                          P
where ϕ ∈ B(X, S). Indeed, a Riemann sum of the form         ϕ(xi ) · σi corresponds
                  L                                        i
to the expression   ϕ(xi ) ⊙ σi = max{ϕ(xi ) + σi }, which tends to the right-hand
                         i                       i
side of (1) as σi → 0. Of course, this is a purely heuristic argument.
   Formula (1) defines the idempotent integral not only for functions taking values
in Rmax , but also in the general case when any of bounded (from above) subsets
of S has the least upper bound.
   An idempotent measure on X is defined by mψ (Y ) = sup ψ(x), where ψ ∈
                                                                                x∈Y
B(X, S). The integral with respect to this measure is defined by
                     Z   ⊕                 Z     ⊕
(2)     Iψ (ϕ) =             ϕ(x) dmψ =              ϕ(x) ⊙ ψ(x) dx = sup (ϕ(x) ⊙ ψ(x)).
                         X                   X                            x∈X


   Obviously, if S = Rmin , then the standard order 4 is opposite to the conventional
order 6, so in this case equation (2) assumes the form
             Z   ⊕                 Z   ⊕
(3)                  ϕ(x) dmψ =            ϕ(x) ⊙ ψ(x) dx = inf (ϕ(x) ⊙ ψ(x)),
              X                     X                               x∈X


where inf is understood in the sense of the conventional order 6.
   The functionals I(ϕ) and Iψ (ϕ) are linear over S; their values correspond to limits
of Lebesgue (or Riemann) sums. The formula for Iψ (ϕ) defines the idempotent
scalar product of the functions ψ and ϕ. Various idempotent functional spaces and
an idempotent version of the theory of distributions can be constructed on the basis
of the idempotent integration, see, e.g., [1, 3–6, 10]. The analogy of idempotent and
probability measures leads to spectacular parallels between optimization theory and
probability theory. For example, the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation corresponds
to the Bellman equation (see, e.g., the survey of Del Moral [11] and [5]). Many
other idempotent analogs may be cited (in particular, for basic constructions and
theorems of functional analysis [4]).

4. The superposition principle and linear problems. Basic equations of
quantum theory are linear (the superposition principle). The Hamilton–Jacobi
equation, the basic equation of classical mechanics, is nonlinear in the conventional
sense. However it is linear over the semiring Rmin . Also, different versions of the
Bellman equation, the basic equation of optimization theory, are linear over suitable
idempotent semirings (V. P. Maslov’s idempotent superposition principle), see [1,
3, 6, 10]. For instance, the finite-dimensional stationary Bellman equation can be
written in the form X = H ⊙ X ⊕ F , where X, H, F are matrices with coefficients
in an idempotent semiring S and the unknown matrix X is determined by H and
F [12]. In particular, standard problems of dynamic programming and the well-
known shortest path problem correspond to the cases S = Rmax and S = Rmin ,
respectively. In [12], it was shown that main optimization algorithms for finite
graphs correspond to standard methods for solving systems of linear equations
of this type (i.e., over semirings). Specifically, Bellman’s shortest path algorithm
corresponds to a version of Jacobi’s algorithm, Ford’s algorithm corresponds to the
Gauss–Seidel iterative scheme, etc.
   Linearity of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation over Rmin (and Rmax ) is closely re-
lated to the (conventional) linearity of the Schrödinger equation. Consider a clas-
sical dynamical system specified by the Hamiltonian

                                          XN
                                               p2i
(6)                         H = H(p, x) =          + V (x),
                                          i=1
                                              2mi

where x = (x1 , . . . , xN ) are generalized coordinates, p = (p1 , . . . , pN ) are general-
ized momenta, mi are generalized masses, and V (x) is the potential. In this case
the Lagrangian L(x, ẋ, t) has the form

                                             N
                                             X           ẋ2i
(7)                          L(x, ẋ, t) =          mi        − V (x),
                                                          2
                                              i=1


where ẋ = (ẋ1 , . . . , ẋN ), ẋi = dxi /dt. The value function S(x, t) of the action
functional has the form
                                           Z t
(8)                              S(x, t) =     L(x(t), ẋ(t), t) dt,
                                         t0


where the integration is performed along a trajectory of the system. The classi-
cal equations of motion are derived as the stationarity conditions for the action
functional (the Hamilton principle, or the least action principle).
   The action functional can be considered as a function taking the set of curves
(trajectories) to the set of real numbers. Assume that its range lies in the semir-
ing Rmin . In this case the minimum of the action functional can be viewed as
the idempotent integral of this function over the set of trajectories or the idem-
potent analog of the Feynman path integral. Thus the least action principle can
be considered as the idempotent version of the well-known Feynman approach to
quantum mechanics (which is presented, e.g., in [13]); here, one should remember
that the exponential function involved in the Feynman integral is monotone on the
real axis. The representation of a solution to the Schrödinger equation in terms of
                                                4
the Feynman integral corresponds to the Lax–Oleı̆nik formula for a solution to the
Hamilton–Jacobi equation.
   Since ∂S/∂xi = pi , ∂S/∂t = −H(p, x), the following Hamilton–Jacobi equation
holds:
                                              
                             ∂S        ∂S
(9)                             +H         , xi = 0.
                             ∂t        ∂xi

   Quantization (see, e.g., [13]) leads to the Schrödinger equation

                                  ~ ∂ψ   b = H(p̂i , x̂i )ψ,
(10)                          −        = Hψ
                                  i ∂t
where ψ = ψ(x, t) is the wave function, i.e., a time-dependent element of the Hilbert
space L2 (RN ), and H b is the energy operator obtained by substitution of the momen-
                         ∂
tum operators pbi = ~i ∂x  i
                             and the coordinate operators x bi : ψ 7→ xi ψ for the variables
pi and xi in the Hamiltonian function, respectively. This equation is linear in the
conventional sense (the quantum superposition principle). The standard procedure
of limit transition from the Schrödinger equation to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
is to use the following ansatz for the wave function: ψ(x, t) = a(x, t)eiS(x,t)/~, and
to keep only the leading order as ~ → 0 (the ‘semiclassical’ limit).
   Instead of doing this, we switch to imaginary values of the Planck constant ~
by the substitution h = i~, assuming h > 0. Thus the Schrödinger equation (1.10)
turns to an analog of the heat equation:
                                                       
                                  ∂u            ∂
(11)                            h    = H −h        , x̂i u,
                                  ∂t           ∂xi

where the real-valued function u corresponds to the wave function ψ. A similar
idea (the switch to imaginary time) is used in the Euclidean quantum field theory
(see, e.g., [14]); let us remember that time and energy are dual quantities.
   Linearity of equation (10) implies linearity of equation (11). Thus if u1 and u2
are solutions of (11), then so is their linear combination

(12)                                 u = λ1 u1 + λ2 u2 .

   Let S = −h ln u or u = e−S/h as in Section 2 above. It can easily be checked
that equation (11) thus turns to

                   ∂t            2mi            ∂xi               2mi ∂x2i
                                   i=1                          i=1

This equation is nonlinear in the conventional sense. However, if S1 and S2 are its
solutions, then so is the function

(14)                              S = λ1 ⊙ S1 ⊕ λ2 ⊙ S2
                                                 h

obtained from (12) by means of our substitution S = −h ln u. Here the generalized
multiplication ⊙ coincides with the ordinary addition and the generalized addition
⊕h is the image of the conventional addition under the above change of variables.
                                             5
As h → 0, we obtain the operations of the idempotent semiring Rmin , i.e., ⊕ = min
and ⊙ = +, and equation (13) turns to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (9), since
the third term in the right-hand side of equation (13) vanishes.
   Thus it is natural to consider the limit function S = λ1 ⊙S1 ⊕λ2 ⊙S2 as a solution
of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation and to expect that this equation can be treated
as linear over Rmin . This argument (clearly, a heuristic one) can be extended to
equations of a more general form. For a rigorous treatment of (semiring) linearity
for these equations see [3, 6] and also [1]. Notice that if h is changed to −h, then
the resulting Hamilton–Jacobi equation is linear over Rmax .
   The idempotent superposition principle indicates that there exist important
problems that are linear over idempotent semirings.
5. Convolution and the Fourier–Legendre transform. Let G be a group.
Then the space B(X, Rmax ) of all bounded functions G → Rmax (see above) is an
idempotent semiring with respect to the following analog ⊛ of the usual convolution:
                            Z   ⊕
(15)     (ϕ(x) ⊛ ψ)(g) ==           ϕ(x) ⊙ ψ(x−1 · g) dx = sup (ϕ(x) + ψ(x−1 · g)).
                             G                                x∈G

Of course, it is possible to consider other “function spaces” (and other basic semir-
ings instead of Rmax ). In [3] “group semirings” of this type are referred to as
convolution semirings.
   Let G = Rn , where Rn is considered as a topological group with respect to the
vector addition. The conventional Fourier–Laplace transform is defined as
                                            Z
(16)                        ϕ(x) 7→ ϕ̃(ξ) =    eiξ·x ϕ(x) dx,
                                                   G

where eiξ·x is a character of the group G, i.e., a solution of the following functional
equation:
                                f (x + y) = f (x)f (y).
The idempotent analog of this equation is

                       f (x + y) = f (x) ⊙ f (y) = f (x) + f (y),

so “continuous idempotent characters” are linear functionals of the form x 7→ ξ ·x =
ξ1 x1 + · · · + ξn xn . As a result, the transform in (16) assumes the form
                                Z   ⊕
(17)          ϕ(x) 7→ ϕ̃(ξ) =           ξ · x ⊙ ϕ(x) dx = sup (ξ · x + ϕ(x)).
                                 G                        x∈G

The transform in (17) is nothing but the Legendre transform (up to some notation)
[10]; transforms of this kind establish the correspondence between the Lagrangian
and the Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics.
   Of course, this construction can be generalized to different classes of groups and
semirings. Transformations of this type convert the generalized convolution ⊛ to
the pointwise (generalized) multiplication and possess analogs of some important
properties of the usual Fourier transform. For the case of semirings of Pareto
sets the corresponding version of the Fourier transform reduces the multicriterial
optimization problem to a family of singlecriterial problems [15].
                                               6
   The examples discussed in this sections can be treated as fragments of an idem-
potent version of the representation theory. In particular, “idempotent” representa-
tions of groups can be examined as representations of the corresponding convolution
semirings (i.e. idempotent group semirings) in semimodules. To present nontrivial
examples from the idempotent version of the representation theory we need some
preliminary material.
6. Idempotent semimodules and linear spaces. Recall that an idempotent
semigroup is an arbitrary commutative (additive) semigroup with idempotent ad-
dition. It can be treated as an ordered set with the following partial order: x 4 y
if and only if x ⊕ y = y. It is easy to see that this order is well-defined and
x ⊕ y = sup{x, y}. For an arbitrary subset X of an idempotent semigroup, we
put ⊕X = sup(X) and ∧X = inf(X) if the corresponding right-hand sides exist.
An idempotent semigroup is called b-complete (or boundedly complete) if any of
its subsets bounded from above (including the empty subset) has the least upper
bound. In particular, any b-complete idempotent semigroup contains zero (denoted
by 0), which coincides with ⊕∅, where ∅ is the empty set. A homomorphism of
b-complete idempotent semigroups is called a b-homomorphism if g(⊕X) = ⊕g(X)
for any subset X bounded from above.
   An idempotent semifield is called b-complete if it is b-complete as an idempotent
semigroup. In any b-complete semifield, the generalized distributive laws

(18)              a ⊙ (⊕X) = ⊕(a ⊙ X),        a ⊙ (∧X) = ∧(a ⊙ X)

are valid; here a is an element of the semifield and X is a nonempty bounded subset.
It is easy to see that Rmax is a b-complete semifield.
    An idempotent semimodule over an idempotent semiring K is an idempotent
semigroup V endowed with a multiplication ⊙ by elements of K such that, for any
a, b ∈ K and x, y ∈ V , the usual laws

(19)                        a ⊙ (b ⊙ x) = (a ⊙ b) ⊙ x,
(20)                        (a ⊕ b) ⊙ x = a ⊙ x ⊕ b ⊙ x,
(21)                        a ⊙ (x ⊕ y) = a ⊙ x ⊕ a ⊙ y,
(22)                              0⊙x=0

are valid. An idempotent semimodule over an idempotent semifield is called an
idempotent space. An idempotent b-complete space V over a b-complete semifield
K is called an idempotent b-space if, for any nonempty bounded subset Q ⊂ K and
any x ∈ V , the relations

(23)              (⊕Q) ⊙ x = ⊕(Q ⊙ x),        (∧Q) ⊙ x = ∧(Q ⊙ x)

hold. A homomorphism g : V → W of b-spaces is called a b-homomorphism, or a
b-linear operator (mapping), if g(⊕X) = ⊕g(X) for any bounded subset X ⊂ V .
More general definitions (for spaces which may not be b-complete) can be found in
[4]. Homomorphisms taking values in K (treated as a semimodule over itself) are
called linear functionals. A subset of an idempotent space is called a subspace if it
is closed with respect to addition and multiplication by coefficients. A subspace in
a b-space is called a b-closed subspace if it is closed with respect to summation over
                                          7
arbitrary bounded (in V) subsets. This subspace has a natural structure of b-space;
it is also a b-subspace in V in the sense of [4].
    For an arbitrary set X and an idempotent space V over a semifield K, we use
B(X, V ) to denote the semimodule of all bounded mappings from X into V with
pointwise operations. If V is an idempotent b-space, then B(X, V ) is a b-space.
A mapping f from a topological space X into an ordered set V is called upper
semicontinuous if, for any b ∈ V , the set {x ∈ X|f (x) < b} is closed in X, see [4].
In the case where V is the set of real numbers, this definition coincides with the
usual definition of upper semicontinuity of a real function. The set of all bounded
upper semicontinuous mappings from X to V is denoted by U SC(X, V ). If V
is an idempotent b-space, then U SC(X, V ) is also a b-space with respect to the
operations f ⊕ g = sup{f, g} and (k ⊙ f )(x) = k ⊙ f (x).
7. Archimedean spaces [16]. In what follows, unless otherwise specified, the
symbol K stands for a b-complete idempotent semifield and all idempotent spaces
are over K.
   A subset M of idempotent b-space V is called wo-closed if ∧X ∈ M and ⊕X ∈ M
for any linearly ordered subset X ⊂ M in V . A nondecreasing mapping f : V → W
of b-spaces is called wo-continuous if f (⊕X) = ⊕f (X) and f (∧X) = ∧f (X) for
any bounded linearly ordered subset X ⊂ V . Note that an arbitrary isomorphism
of ordered sets is wo-continuous. It can be shown that the notions of wo-closedness
and wo-continuity coincide with the closedness and continuity with respect to some
T 1 topology defined in an intrinsic way in terms of the order.
Proposition 1. Suppose that V is an idempotent b-space and W is a wo-closed
subsemigroup of V . Then ⊕X ∈ W for any subset X ⊂ W bounded in V . In
particular, each wo-closed subspace is a b-closed subspace.
   An element x of an idempotent space V is called Archimedean if, for any y ∈ V ,
there exists a coefficient λ ∈ K such that λ ⊙ x < y. For an Archimedean element
x ∈ V , the formula x∗ (y) = ∧{k ∈ K|k ⊙ x < y} defines a mapping x∗ : V → K. If
V is an idempotent b-space, then x∗ is a b-linear functional and x∗ (y) ⊙ x < y for
any y ∈ V [6]. We say that an Archimedean element x ∈ V is wo-continuous if the
functional x∗ is wo-continuous, and that an idempotent b-space V is Archimedean
if V contains a wo-continuous Archimedean element.
Proposition 2. If X is a compact topological space, then USC(X,K) is an Archi-
medean space and the function e identically equal to 1 is a wo-continuous Archime-
dean element.
  Note that e∗ (f ) = sup{f (x)|x ∈ X}.
Theorem 1. Any wo-closed subspace of an Archimedean space is an Archimedean
space. Any linearly ordered (with respect to the inclusion) family of nonzero wo-
closed subspaces of an Archimedean space V has a nonzero intersection.
   Let V be a b-space. A subset W ⊂ V is called a ∧-subspace if it is closed with
respect to multiplication by scalars and taking greatest lower bounds of nonempty
subsets. By this definition, any such W is a boundedly complete lattice with respect
to the order inherited from V . Therefore, any ∧-subspace W ⊂ V can be treated
as a semimodule with respect to the inherited multiplication by scalars and the
operations x ⊕W y = sup{x, y}, where sup is over W . In what follows, all ∧-
subspaces are considered as semimodules with respect to these operations. The
                                          8
definitions immediately imply that any ∧-subspace of a b-space is a b-space. It is
easy to show that U SC(X, V ) is a ∧-subspace in B(X, V ) for any b-space V and
any topological space X.
Proposition 3. If V is an Archimedean b-space and x ∈ V is a wo-continuous
Archimedean element, then any ∧-subspace W of V containing x is an Archimedean
b-space.
    An arbitrary semiring K is called algebraically closed (or radicable, see, e.g. [5])
if for any element x ∈ K and any positive integer number n there exists an element
y ∈ K such that y n = x. It is easy to show that Rmax is a b-complete algebraically
closed semifield.
Theorem 2. An idempotent b-space V over an algebraically closed b-complete
semifield K is Archimedean if and only if there exists a space of the form USC(X,K),
where X is a compact topological space, such that V is isomorphic to its ∧-subspace
containing constants.
8. Representations of groups in Archimedean spaces. Suppose that V is an
Archimedean idempotent b-space over an algebraically closed b-complete semifield
(e.g., over Rmax ). By End(V ) denote the set of all b-linear operators V → V .
This set is an idempotent semigroup with respect to the pointwise sum and it is a
b-space over K with respect to the standard multiplication by coefficients from K.
The usual multiplication (composition) of maps turns End(V ) into an idempotent
semiring (and a b-complete semialgebra over K).
   Let G be an abstract group. A linear representation π : G → End(V ) of G in
an Archimedean space V is a homomorphism from G to the group of all invertible
elements in End(V ) (with respect to the composition of operators). The represen-
tation π is (topologically) irreducible if the space V has no nontrivial wo-closed
π(G)-invariant subspaces.
Theorem 3. Every linear representation of a group G in an Archimedean idempo-
tent space V has a nontrivial irreducible subrepresentation in a wo-closed subspace
of V .
Theorem 4. Let π be a linear representation of a group G in an Archimedean
idempotent space V and for a nonzero element x ∈ V the orbit π(G)x is bounded.
Set a = ⊕(π(G)x). Then π(g)a = a for each g ∈ G.
   We shall say that a representation π of G in V has a (nonzero) joint eigenvector
a ∈ V if π(g)a = λ(g)a for all g ∈ G, where λ(g) ∈ K.
Corollary 1. Every linear representation of a finite group in an Archimedean
idempotent space has a joint eigenvector with a unique eigenvalue 1.
Corollary 2. Every upper semicontinuous linear representation of a compact group
in an Archimedean idempotent space has a joint eigenvector with a unique eigen-
value 1.
9. An Engel type theorem for representations of nilpotent groups. Let
G be an abstract group. For elements a, b ∈ G we set [a, b] = a−1 b−1 ab; for
subsets X and Y in G we denote by [X, Y ] a subgroup in G generated by the set
{[x, y]|x ∈ X, y ∈ Y }; we set Γ1 (G) = G, Γi (G) = [G, Γi−1 (G)], i = 1, 2, 3, . . .
Recall that an abstract group G is nilpotent if and only if there exists a positive
                                           9
integer number n such that Γn (G) = {e}, where e is the neutral element (identity)
of G.
Theorem 5. Every linear representation of a nilpotent abstract group in an Archi-
medean idempotent space over an algebraically closed b-complete semifield (e.g.,
over Rmax ) has a joint eigenvector.
Corollary 3. Every collection of commuting invertible b-linear operators in an
Archimedean idempotent space has a joint eigenvector.
Corollary 4. Every invertible b-linear operator in an arbitrary Archimedean idem-
potent space over an algebraically closed b-complete semifield has an eigenvector.
   Remark. There is no idempotent version of the well known Lie theorem for
representations of abstract solvable groups in idempotent spaces. Moreover, there
exists an irreducible linear representation of a solvable group in the idempotent
space V = Rmax × Rmax over Rmax .
