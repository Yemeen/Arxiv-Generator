                                                    Abstract. Let S(m|n, d) be the Schur superalgebra whose supermodules correspond to
                                                    the polynomial representations of the supergroup GL(m|n) of degree d. In this paper
                                                    we determine the representation type of these algebras (i.e. classify the ones which are
                                                    semisimple, have finite, tame and wild representation type). Moreover, we prove that these
                                                    algebras are in general not quasi-hereditary and have infinite global dimension.




                                             1 Introduction

                                             1.1 A central problem in the study of finite-dimensional algebras is to understand the
                                             structure of the indecomposable modules. As a first step one would like to know how many
                                             indecomposable modules a given algebra admits. Any finite-dimensional algebra can be
                                             classified into one of three categories: finite, tame, or wild representation type. A finite-
                                             dimensional algebra A has finite representation type if A has finitely many indecomposable
                                             modules up to isomorphism. If A is not of finite type then A is of infinite representation
                                             type. Algebras of infinite representation type are either of tame representation type or of
                                             wild representation type. For algebras of tame representation type one has a chance of
                                             classifying all the indecomposable modules up to isomorphism.
                                                There have been much progress in the past ten years in determining the representation
                                             type of important classes of finite-dimensional algebras. The Schur algebras and the q-Schur
                                             algebra are finite-dimensional algebras which arise in the representation theory of the general
                                             linear groups and symmetric groups. A complete classification of the representation type
                                             of these algebras was given by Doty, Erdmann, Martin and Nakano [E, DN, DEMN, EN1].
                                             These algebras are fundamental examples of quasi-hereditary algebras (or equivalently high-
                                             est weight categories) which were introduced by Cline, Parshall and Scott [CPS]. The blocks
                                             for the ordinary and parabolic BGG category O for finite-dimensional complex semisimple
                                             Lie algebras are other important examples of highest weight categories. Results pertaining
                                             to the representation type for these blocks were obtained independently by Futorny, Nakano
                                             and Pollack [FNP], and Brüstle, König and Mazorchuk [BKM] for the ordinary category

O and more recently for the parabolic category O by Boe and Nakano [BN]. For quasi-
hereditary algebras the projective modules admit filtrations by certain standard modules.
This information allows one to determine the structure of the projective modules which in
turn can lead to an expression of the algebra via quiver and relations. In many cases this
information can be used to determine the representation type of the algebra.
   Other important classes of finite-dimensional algebras are quasi-Frobenius algebras where
all projective modules are injective. These algebras all have infinite global dimension (ex-
cept when the algebra is semisimple). For group algebras, restricted enveloping algebras,
and Frobenius kernels homological information involving the theory of complexity and sup-
port varieties can be used to deduce information about the representation type of these
algebras. For Hecke algebras of type A, the representation type of the blocks was given by
Erdmann and Nakano in [EN2]. Ariki and Mathas [AM] classified the representation type
for Hecke algebras of type B using Fock space methods. Ariki [A] recently has extended
this classification to Hecke algebras of classical type.
   The main result of this paper is a complete classification of the representation type for
the Schur superalgebras S(m|n, d). These algebras are of particular interest because the
category of S(m|n, d)-supermodules is equivalent to the category of polynomial represen-
tations of degree d for the supergroup GL(m|n). Also, as with the classical Schur algebra,
there is a Schur-Weyl duality between S(m|n, d) and the symmetric group Σd (see [BK]).
We shall show that in most cases S(m|n, d) is not quasi-hereditary, which is contrary to
a recent conjecture given by Marko and Zubkov. Since the Schur superalgebras are not
quasi-hereditary the aforementioned filtration techniques cannot be used. In order to ob-
tain information about the basic algebra for certain Schur superalgebras we will compute
the endomorphism algebras of direct sums of signed Young modules. This will entail know-
ing the structures of certain signed Young modules, which is of independent interest from
the viewpoint of the representation theory of symmetric groups.

1.2 We review below the results for the ordinary Schur algebra S(m, d), although the
proof for S(m|n, d) does not rely on these results. The representation type of S(m, d) was
determined in [E, DN, DEMN]1.
(1.2.1) Theorem . Let S(m, d) be the Schur algebra over k where char k ≥ 0.
   (a) S(m, d) is semisimple if and only if one of the following holds
          (i) char k = 0;
         (ii) d < p;
        (iii) p = 2, m = 2, d = 3.
   (b) S(m, d) has finite representation type if and only if one of the following holds
          (i) p ≥ 2, m ≥ 3, d < 2p;
         (ii) p ≥ 2, m = 2, d < p2 ;
        (iii) p = 2, m = 2, d = 5, 7.
    (c) S(m, d) has tame representation type if and only if one of the following holds
          (i) p = 3, m = 3, d = 7, 8;
    1The statement that S(2, 11) for p = 2 has tame representation type was inadvertently omitted from the
original statement of the theorem [DEMN, Thm. 1.2(A)]. We thank Alison Parker for pointing this out to
us.

        (ii) p = 3, m = 2, d = 9, 10, 11;
       (iii) p = 2, m = 2, d = 4, 9, 11.
   (d) In all other cases not listed above S(m, d) has wild representation type.

   The classification of the representation type of the q-Schur algebras Sq (m, d) can be found
in [EN1, Thm. 1.4(A)-(C)].

1.3 Throughout this paper we will assume that k is an algebraically closed field of char-
acteristic p ≥ 0. The following theorem summarizes our results on the Schur superalgebras.

(1.3.1) Theorem . Let S(m|n, d) be the Schur superalgebra over k where char k 6= 2.
   (a) S(m|n, d) is semisimple if and only if one of the following holds
         (i) char k = 0;
        (ii) d < p;
       (iii) m = n = 1 and p ∤ d.
   (b) S(m|n, d) has finite representation type but is not semisimple if and only if one of
       the following holds
         (i) p ≤ d < 2p;
        (ii) m = n = 1 and p | d.
   (c) In all other cases not listed above S(m|n, d) has wild representation type.

  We should remark that when in characteristic two S(m|n, d) is equal to the ordinary
Schur algebra S(m + n, d), and its representation type is classified by Theorem 1.2.1.

2 Comparing Module Categories for Superalgebras

2.1 Recall that k denotes our fixed ground field. All objects defined over k (algebras,
modules, superalgebras, supermodules, etc.) are assumed to be finite-dimensional as k-
vector spaces.
   A superspace is a Z2 -graded k-vector space V = V0̄ ⊕ V1̄ . Given a homogeneous ele-
ment of a superspace, v ∈ V, we write v ∈ Z2 for the degree of the element. If V and
W are superspaces, then Homk (V, W ) is naturally a superspace with Homk (V, W )0̄ (resp.
Homk (V, W )1̄ ) consisting of all linear maps which preserve (resp. reverse) grading.
   A superalgebra is a Z2 -graded associative k-algebra A = A0̄ ⊕ A1̄ which satisfies Ar As ⊆
Ar+s for all r, s ∈ Z2 . An A-supermodule is a Z2 -graded A-module M = M0̄ ⊕ M1̄ which
satisfies Ar Ms ⊆ Mr+s for all r, s ∈ Z2 . An A-supermodule homomorphism is a linear map
f : M → N which satisfies f (am) = (−1)f a af (m) for all homogeneous a ∈ A and all
m ∈ M. As we will do later without comment, the given condition makes sense only for
homogeneous elements. The general case is obtained by linearity. Note that if M and N
are A-supermodules, then HomA (M, N ) is naturally a superspace just as in the previous
paragraph.
   We can define the parity change functor Π on the category of A-supermodules as follows.
On an object M we have that ΠM = M as a vector space, but we switch the Z2 -grading
by setting (ΠM )r = Mr+1̄ for r ∈ Z2 . The action of A is defined via a.m = (−1)a am for
homogeneous a ∈ A and m ∈ M. On a morphism f, Πf is the same linear map as f. We

refer the reader to [BKl, Sect. 2] for further discussion of general results on superalgebras,
supermodules, etc.
   Throughout the remainder of this subsection we assume char k 6= 2. Given a superalgebra
A there are three module categories which are natural to consider:
      (i) the category A-smod of all A-supermodules and all (not necessarily graded) A-
          supermodule homomorphisms;
     (ii) the underlying even category of A-smod where we take the objects of A-smod but
          only the even (i.e. grading preserving) homomorphisms;
    (iii) the category A-mod of all A-modules.
Observe that an A-supermodule is indecomposable or irreducible regardless of whether we
view it as an object of the category A-smod or its underlying even category. If M and N are
indecomposable A-supermodules and f : M → N is an A-supermodule isomorphism, write
f = f0̄ + f1̄ with fr ∈ HomA (M, N )r for r ∈ Z2 . Note that by considering the Z2 -grading
it is straightforward to verify that f0̄ − f1̄ : M → N is also an isomorphism. Using this one
can show that the map M ⊕ ΠM → N ⊕ ΠN given by
                         (m, n) 7→ (f0̄ (m) + f1̄ (n), f1̄ (m) + f0̄ (n))
is in fact an even isomorphism of A-supermodules. Consequently, by the graded version
of the Krull-Schmidt theorem we see that M is isomorphic to either N or ΠN by an even
isomorphism. Taken together the above discussion proves that the category A-smod is
semisimple, finite, tame, or wild if and only if its underlying even category is semisimple,
finite, tame, or wild, respectively. We use this observation without comment in what fol-
lows. The remainder of this section is devoted to studying the relationship between the
representation type of these categories and the category A-mod.
   Given a superspace V, let δ : V → V be the linear involution defined by δ(v) = (−1)v v,
where v ∈ V is homogeneous. In particular, the involution δ : A → A is an algebra
homomorphism and defines an action of Z2 on A. Consequently, we can define the smash
product of kZ2 and A as follows. Set
                                        B = kZ2 ⊗k A
as a vector space. Identify kZ2 with k[x]/(x2 − 1). Then the product in B is given by
                             (xr ⊗ a)(xs ⊗ b) = xr+s ⊗ δs (a)b,                        (2.1.1)
where r, s ∈ {0, 1} and a, b ∈ A. We identify kZ2 and A as subalgebras via kZ2 ⊗1 and 1⊗A,
respectively. Note that since we assume char k 6= 2, x acts semisimply on any kZ2 -module
with eigenvalues ±1. The following result is proven in [Mui, Thm. 1.4b].
(2.1.2) Proposition . The category of B-modules is isomorphic to the underlying even
category of A-supermodules.
Proof. Let M be an A-supermodule. We define an action of kZ2 on M via xm = δ(m).
It is straightforward to verify that this makes M into a B-module. Conversely, if M is a
B-module, then we can view it as an A-module by restriction. To obtain a Z2 -grading we
set M0̄ (resp. M1̄ ) to be the 1 (resp. −1) eigenspace of x acting on M . One can verify
that this Z2 -grading makes M into an A-supermodule. It is straightforward to verify that
a morphism in one category restricts or extends to a morphism in the other category.   

2.2 Note that there is an involution ζ : B → B given by xr ⊗ a 7→ (−1)r xr ⊗ a for
r ∈ {0, 1} and a ∈ A. Given a B-module M we can twist it by ζ, which we denote by M ζ .
Namely, M ζ = M as a vector space but with the action of B given by b.m = ζ(b)m for all
b ∈ B and m ∈ M. Note that M ζ is indecomposable if and only if M is indecomposable.
   Since A is a subalgebra of B, there is a restriction functor resB
                                                                   A : B-mod → A-mod and
                        B
an induction functor indA : A-mod → B-mod given by
                                    indB
                                       A N = B ⊗A N
for any A-module N. Note that
                                 indB  ∼
                                    AN =1⊗N ⊕x⊗N                                     (2.2.1)
as A-modules. If M is a B-module, then we have
                              M ⊕ Mζ ∼  = indB resB M.
                                                A    A                               (2.2.2)
Since x acts semisimply on M and M ζ , it suffices to define the isomorphism on eigenvectors
m ∈ M, m′ ∈ M ζ of eigenvalue ε, ε′ ∈ {±1}, respectively. Then the map M ⊕ M ζ →
indB    B
   A resA M is given by
                        (m, m′ ) 7→ (1 + εx) ⊗ m + (1 − ε′ x) ⊗ m′ .
To verify that the map is B-linear, one uses the observation that if a ∈ A is an eigenvector
for the action of x with eigenvalue α and m ∈ M is an eigenvector for the action of x with
eigenvalue β, then am is an eigenvector with eigenvalue αβ.
(2.2.3) Proposition . Let M be an indecomposable B-module. Then M is either indecom-
posable as an A-module or the direct sum of two indecomposable A-modules. Furthermore,
every indecomposable A-module N is a direct summand of indBA N as A-modules.
  On the other hand, if M is an indecomposable B-module which contains N as a direct
summand, then M is unique up to isomorphism and twisting by ζ.
Proof. Let M be an indecomposable B-module and let
                                   M = M1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Mk                               (2.2.4)
be a decomposition of M into indecomposable A-modules. By using (2.2.2) and applying
indBA one has
                           M ⊕ Mζ ∼ = indB                   B
                                          A M1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ indA Mk .
Since the left hand side is a decomposition as indecomposable B-modules, by the Krull-
Schmidt theorem it follows that (2.2.4) cannot have more than two direct summands.
   Now say N is an indecomposable A-module. By (2.2.1) we see that N is a direct summand
of indB
      A N. On the other hand, if M is an indecomposable B-module which contains N as
a direct summand, then indB      ∼         ζ               B       B
                            A M = M ⊕ M contains indA N. If indA N is indecomposable,
                ∼    B           ∼
then either M = indA N or M = (indA N ) . If indA N is decomposable, then indB
                                       B     ζ         B                               ∼
                                                                                   AN =
        ζ
M ⊕ M . This proves the desired result.
                                                                                          

   As is well known, if M is an irreducible A-supermodule then as an A-module M is
either irreducible or the direct sum of two irreducibles. Combining the previous result with
Proposition 2.2.3 shows this behaviour extends to indecomposables.

2.3 We can now prove the main result of this section: the representation type of A as a
superalgebra coincides with that of A as an algebra.
(2.3.1) Theorem . The category A-smod is semisimple, finite, tame, or wild if and only
if the same is true for A-mod.
Proof. By Proposition 2.1.2 it suffices to consider the category B-mod rather than A-smod.
Semisimple type: That A-smod is semisimple if and only if B-mod is semisimple is already
known. See, for example, [BKl, Sect. 2] or [Mui, Thm. 1.4c].
Finite type: It is clear from Proposition 2.2.3 that A-mod has finitely many indecomposables
if and only if B-mod does.
Tame type: Suppose A-mod has tame representation type. Let t be an indeterminant and
d a positive integer. Then there are indecomposable A-modules Dd,1 , . . . , Dd,rd and inde-
composable A − k[t]-bimodules Ed,1 , . . . , Ed,sd which are free as right k[t]-modules so that
any indecomposable A-module of dimension d is either isomorphic to Dd,i for some i, or
is isomorphic to Ed,i ⊗k[t] L for some i and some irreducible k[t]-module L. Observe that
the proof Proposition 2.2.3 applies verbatim to indecomposable A − k[t]-bimodules. Con-
sequently, we can choose indecomposable B-modules D                 e d,1 , . . . , D
                                                                                    e d,r and indecomposable
                                                                                         d
B − k[t]-bimodules E   ed,1 , . . . , E
                                      ed,s (which are free as k[t]-supermodules) where D           e d,i contains
                                          d
Dd,i as a direct summand as A-modules and E                ed,i contains Ed,i as a direct summand as
A − k[t]-bimodules.
   Let M be an indecomposable B-module and N an indecomposable direct summand of
M as an A-module. If N ∼              = Dd,i for some d and i, then by the uniqueness statement
in Proposition 2.2.3 it follows that M ∼          = D e d,i or M ∼  = (D  e d,i )ζ . On the other hand, say
N∼ = Ed,i ⊗k[t] L for some d, i, and irreducible k[t]-module L. Since Ed,i is a direct summand
of Eed,i , we have that N ∼     = Ed,i ⊗k[t] L is a direct summand of E              ed,i ⊗k[t] L. However, by
                                        e
[DEMN, Lemma 2.2] we know Ed,i ⊗k[t] L is indecomposable. By uniqueness again we have
M∼  =E ed,i ⊗k[t] L or M ∼ = (E    ed,i ⊗k[t] L)ζ = (E
                                                     ed,i )ζ ⊗k[t] L. Therefore, if A-mod is tame, then
B-mod is tame.
Wild type: Suppose that A-mod has wild representation type. By [DEMN, Theorem 2.2]
and Proposition 2.2.3 it follows that B-mod has wild representation type.
                                                                                                                   



3 Results on the Schur Superalgebra

3.1 The Schur Superalgebra: Fix nonnegative integers m, n, and d, and fix a superspace
V with fixed basis v1 , . . . , vm+n and Z2 -grading given by setting v i = 0̄ for i = 1, . . . , m
and v i = 1̄ for i = m + 1, . . . , m + n. The tensor space V ⊗d is then naturally Z2 -graded by
setting the degree of vi1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vid to be v i1 + · · · + v id for all 1 ≤ i1 , . . . , id ≤ m + n. The
symmetric group Σd acts on V ⊗d on the right via
    vi1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vij ⊗ vij+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vid (j j + 1) := (−1)v̄ij v̄ij+1 vi1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vij+1 ⊗ vij ⊗ · · · ⊗ vid

for 1 ≤ i1 , . . . , id ≤ m + n and each 1 ≤ j < d.
   The Schur superalgebra is defined to be
                                        S(m|n, d) = EndΣd (V ⊗d ),
with the Z2 -grading given by setting S(m|n, d)0̄ (resp. S(m|n, d)1̄ ) to be the set of all
degree preserving (resp. degree reversing) maps. Observe that when p = 2 the above action
coincides with the usual permutation action and so S(m|n, d) = S(m + n, d).
   We also note that S(m|n, d) ∼        = S(n|m, d) as superalgebras. Namely, let t : {1, . . . , m +
n} → {1, . . . , m + n} be given by t(i) = i + n if i = 1, . . . , m and t(i) = i − m if i =
m + 1, . . . , m + n. Fix a superspace Ve with fixed basis ṽ1 , . . . , ṽm+n and Z2 -grading given
by setting ṽ i = 0̄ for i = 1, . . . , n and ṽ i = 1̄ for i = n + 1, . . . , m + n. Define a linear map
τ : V ⊗d ⊗ sgn → Ve ⊗d via
           τ (vi1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vid ⊗ 1) = (−1)(d−1)v i1 +(d−2)v i2 +···+vid−1 ṽt(i1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ ṽt(id ) ,
where vi1 , . . . , vid are elements of our fixed homogeneous basis for V. It is straightforward to
verify on simple transpositions that in fact τ is a kΣd -module isomorphism (c.f. the proof
of [BK, Theorem 6.4]). Consequently we have
        S(m|n, d) = EndΣd (V ⊗d ) ∼
                                  = EndΣd (V ⊗d ⊗ sgn) ∼
                                                       = EndΣd (Ve ⊗d ) = S(n|m, d),
and the isomorphisms preserve the Z2 -grading.
  We now introduce certain modules which will be crucial in later calculations. Given a
tuple of integers γ = (γ1 , . . . , γt ) we denote the integer γ1 + · · · + γt by |γ|. Let
                                                                                                 	
  Λ(m|n, d) = (λ1 , . . . , λm |µ1 , . . . , µn ) ∈ Zm+n | λi , µi ≥ 0 for all i and |λ| + |µ| = d .
We write (λ|µ) for an element of Λ(m|n, d).
 In general, given γ = (γ1 , . . . , γt ), a sequence of nonnegative integers summing to r, let
                                       Σγ = Σγ1 × Σγ2 × · · · × Σγt
viewed as a subgroup of Σr in the natural way by Σγ1 acting as permutations of the first
γ1 letters, Σγ2 acting as permutations of the next γ2 letters, and so on.
   Given (λ|µ) ∈ Λ(m|n, d) we define the signed permutation module M (λ|µ) as
                                       M (λ|µ) = indΣ
                                                    Σλ ×Σµ k ⊠ sgn,
                                                      d


where k denotes the trivial module for Σλ1 × · · · × Σλm and sgn denotes the one dimensional
sign representation for Σµ1 × · · · × Σµn .
   By definition a Σd -module is a signed Young module if for some nonnegative integers m
and n and (λ|µ) ∈ Λ(m|n, d) it is a direct summand of M (λ|µ) . Signed permutation modules
and signed Young modules were first considered by Donkin [Do]. Finally we observe the
well known fact that as kΣd modules with the action from above we have:
                                                       M
                                       V ⊗d ∼
                                            =                     M (λ|µ) .                                (3.1.1)
                                                 (λ|µ)∈Λ(m|n,d)


3.2   We begin by collecting a few preliminary results.
8              DAVID J. HEMMER, JONATHAN KUJAWA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO

(3.2.1) Proposition . Let S be a finite-dimensional algebra containing an idempotent e,
so eSe is a subalgebra of S.
    (a) Every indecomposable eSe-module is a summand of the restriction to eSe of some
        indecomposable S-module.
    (b) If eSe has infinite representation type then so does S.
    (c) If eSe has wild representation type then so does S.
Proof. (a) Let N be an indecomposable eSe-module. Let U = S ⊗eSe N . Then U is a
nonzero S-module and:
                                   U∼ = eU ⊕ (1 − e)U
                         ∼
as eSe modules. But eU = N . Now writing U as a direct sum of indecomposable S modules
and an easy argument with the Krull-Schmidt theorem gives the result. (b) This is clear
from part (a). If S had only finitely many indecomposable modules then part (a) would
imply eSe does as well. (c) This statement follows from the argument of Theorem 2.2 in
[DEMN]. If the statement of (a) holds for an arbitrary algebra A and subalgebra B, the
authors show that if A is tame then so is B.                                          


3.3 One can now apply the previous result to specific situation of S(m|n, d): This allows
us to descend from the superalgebra S(m′ |n′ , d) to S(m|n, d) for m ≤ m′ , n ≤ n′ .
(3.3.1) Corollary . Let m ≤ m′ and n ≤ n′ . Then:
   (a) If S(m|n, d) has infinite representation type then so does S(m′ |n′ , d).
   (b) If S(m|n, d) has wild representation type then so does S(m′ |n′ , d).
Proof. Recall that Λ(m|n, d) is the set of pairs (λ|µ) where λ and µ are compositions with
|λ| + |µ| = d and λ has at most m parts, µ has at most n parts. Thus Λ(m|n, d) is naturally
a subset of Λ(m′ |n′ , d). Recall that:
                                                                   
                                                    M
                         S(m′ |n′ , d) ∼
                                       = EndkΣd            M (λ|µ)  .
                                               (λ|µ)∈Λ(m′ |n′ ,d)

   So if we let e denote the projection onto the direct sum of all M (λ|µ) with (λ|µ) ∈
Λ(m|n, d) then it is clear that eS(m′ |n′ , d)e ∼
                                                = S(m|n, d), so we can apply Proposition 3.2.1
to prove the result.                                                                         


3.4 The classical (and infinitesimal) Schur algebra S(n, n) has a natural one-dimensional
representation corresponding to the determinant for GL(n). This allows one to embed
the module category for S(n, d) into that of S(n, d + n), which can be used to study rep-
resentation type (e.g. [DNP, Thm. 2.2]). Unfortunately the analogue of the determinant
representation for the supergroup GL(m|n), the one-dimensional Berezinian representation,
is not polynomial and so it does not give a natural one-dimensional S(m|n, m + n)-module.
   We instead use the existence of a one-dimensional representation for S(2|1, p). Namely,
let L(0, 0|p) denote one-dimensional supermodule which is the Frobenius twist of the one-
dimensional GL(2) × GL(1)-module L(0, 0) ⊠ L(1) (see [BK, Remark 4.6]). Since the poly-
nomial representations of GL(m|n) correspond with the representations of the supermonoid
                               REPRESENTATION TYPE OF S(m|n, d)                                    9

M (m|n) one can follow the arguments given in [DNP, Prop. 2.1, Prop. 2.2] by replacing
the determinant representation with L(0, 0|p) to deduce the following result.
(3.4.1) Proposition . If S(2|1, d) has wild representation type then so does S(2|1, d + cp)
for any c ∈ N.

3.5 We will assume familiarity with basic modular representation theory of the symmetric
group. In the next section we will prove the main result of the paper. Surprisingly, we
will use virtually no representation theory of the superalgebra. However, we will need to
                                   c
know that Young modules Y (a,b,1 ) are actually signed Young modules when c < p and
m = 2, n = 1.
                                                                              c)
(3.5.1) Proposition . Let 1 ≤ c < p. Then the Young module Y (a,b,1                is a summand of
the signed permutation module M (a,b|c) .
Proof. Since c < p we have

                               c
                                                        M           λ
                           M (1 ) ∼
                                  = kΣc ∼
                                        = indΣ     ∼
                                             Σ1c k =
                                               c
                                                         (S λ )dim S .                      (3.5.2)
                                                         λ⊢c

But the Specht module     Sλ has dimension greater than one except when λ = (1c ) or λ = c.
Thus using (3.5.2) we obtain:
                  c
                                                   M
          M (a,b,1 ) ∼
                     = M (a,b,c) ⊕ M (a,b|c)                    indΣ                    λ dλ
                                                                   Σa ×Σb ×Σc (k ⊠ k ⊠ S )
                                                                     d

                                             λ⊢c, λ6=(1c ), (c)                              (3.5.3)
                                     c                                                            c)
with all the dλ > 1. Since Y (a,b,1 ) occurs exactly once as a direct summand of M (a,b,1
                   c
and HomΣd (Y (a,b,1 ) , M (a,b,c) ) = 0, the result follows from (3.5.3).
                                                                                                  


3.6 The significance of Proposition 3.5.1 is that it gives us a Young module Y λ as a
summand of the tensor space V ⊗d , even though λ has more than three parts and m + n = 3.
We need information about one other special signed Young module for the p = 3 case.
(3.6.1) Proposition . Suppose p does not divide a. Then:
                                                    p−1        p
                                M (a,0|p) ∼
                                          = S (a+1,1 ) ⊕ S (a,1 ) .
The two Specht modules in the decomposition are both irreducible and:
                                        p            p−2
                                  S (a,1 ) ∼
                                           = D (a,2,1 ) .
Proof. The Specht module decomposition follows from Young’s rule (see [J2, p.51]). The
irreducibility of the “hook” Specht modules when p ∤ d is well known work of Peel [P].
                                         p
Finally knowing which irreducible S (a,1 ) corresponds to can be calculated directly, or also
follows as a very special case of a theorem of James [J1, Thm. A].                          

4 Proof of the main result
  In this section we prove Theorem 1.3.1. One of the main ideas will be to identify a
subalgebra eSe with kQ/I for some quiver Q. Then we can use Gabriel’s Theorem, since if
the separated quiver is not a Dynkin or Euclidean diagram then the algebra is of wild type.

4.1 S(1|1, d) :
   If n = 0 or m = 0 the superalgebra S(m|n, d) is isomorphic to the Schur algebra S(m, d),
so the smallest nontrivial case for us is the superalgebra S(1|1, d). This has been studied
by Marko and Zubkov:
(4.1.1) Proposition . [MZ, Prop. 2.1] Let S = S(1|1, d). If p does not divide d then S
is semisimple. If p divides d then S has d + 1 pairwise non-isomorphic one-dimensional
modules, labelled by the weights 0, 1, . . . , d. The algebra is basic, connected, and has left
regular representation given by:
                      0     1       2                 r−1               r
                S S = 1 ⊕ 0   2 ⊕ 1   3 ⊕ · · · ⊕ r − 2            r ⊕ r−1               (4.1.2)
                            1       2                 r−1
  From here it is easy to obtain the quiver. In particular, for m ≥ 1 we define an algebra
Ãm to be the algebra kQ/I where Q is the quiver with m + 1 vertices

                         α1 ✲   α                           αm−1 ✲        αm ✲
                    r✛        r✛ 2 ✲        ♣    ♣   ♣    ✛          r✛        r
                         β1     β2                          βm−1          βm

and I is the ideal generated by the relations:
     αi αi+1 = 0, βi+1 βi = 0 α1 β1 = βm αm = 0 and βi αi = αi+1 βi+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1.
   We remark that the quiver for Ãm is the same as the quiver for Erdmann’s algebra
(defined in [E, 3.1]) Am+1 with one additional relation, namely that βm αm = 0. As we
will see in Section 5, this extra relation is crucial in that it makes the algebra have infinite
global dimension.
(4.1.3) Theorem . When p divides d the algebra S(1|1, d) is isomorphic to the algebra Ãd
and has finite representation type.
Proof. The proof of the algebra isomorphism is essentially the same as Proposition 3.2 in
[E], so we do not give it here. The algebra Ãm is a three nilpotent algebra, but the only
indecomposable modules of radical length three are projective. Hence, the representation
type of Ãm is the same as the representation type of Ãm modulo its radical squared (which
is two nilpotent). The separated quiver is a disjoint union of two copies of the Dynkin
diagram Am+1 , and hence by Gabriel’s Theorem the algebra is of finite type.              


4.2 S(m|n, d), d < 2p : We first consider the case where p ≤ d < 2p. It turns out this
case is essentially the same as for the Schur algebra S(2, d). Recall that the summands of
the signed permutation modules M (α|β) are called signed Young modules. We recall the
following theorem of Donkin.
                               REPRESENTATION TYPE OF S(m|n, d)                               11

(4.2.1) Theorem . [Do, 2.3 (6)] Let m, n ≥ d. The isomorphism classes of indecomposible
signed Young modules are labelled by the set
                            Λ++ (m|n, d) := {(λ|pµ) | |λ| + p|µ| = d}
where λ and µ are partitions.
Following [Do], we write Y (λ|pµ) for the indecomposible signed Young module labelled by
(λ|pµ) ∈ Λ++ (m|n, d).
   We wish to show that for d < 2p the signed Young modules are exactly the ordinary
Young and twisted Young modules. To begin we will show that the nonprojective signed
Young modules are all distinct.
   Given a partition λ ⊢ d, let λ′ denote the transpose partition of λ. For λ ⊢ d p-regular we
let m(λ) be the Mullineux conjugate of λ, so D λ ⊗ sgn ∼   = D m(λ) . It is well known that the
                  m(λ)′                             λ
Young module Y          is the projective cover of D , a fact we will use several times below.
(4.2.2) Proposition . If the Young module Y λ is isomorphic to a twisted Young module
Y µ ⊗ sgn, then λ is p-restricted, in which case λ = m(µ′ )′ .
Proof. Applying the adjoint Schur functor to Y λ and Y µ ⊗ sgn (see [HN, Thms 3.4.2, 3.8.2])
tells us that P (λ) ∼
                    = T (µ′ ). But the tilting modules are self dual, so P (λ) is self-dual and
hence has simple socle L(λ). But V (µ′ ) is a submodule of T (µ′ ) and the socle of V (µ′ ) is
L(m(µ′ )′ ) so λ = m(µ′ )′ is p-restricted.                                                   

   For d < 2p it is clear that the p-singular partitions are exactly those of the form (µ1 +
p, µ2 , . . . ) for µ a partition of d − p. Thus the number of signed Young modules for d is the
total number of partitions of d plus the number of p-singular partitions, which by Prop. 4.2.2
is precisely the number of Young and twisted Young modules. We have shown the following
result.
(4.2.3) Proposition . For p ≤ d < 2p the signed Young modules are exactly the set of
Young modules Y λ together with the nonprojective twisted Young modules Y µ ⊗ sgn where
µ is p-singular.
   We also remark that the non-projective Young modules are actually irreducible and are
in distinct blocks. Symmetric group blocks of defect one are well understood and we have
the following. Let τ ⊢ d − p and let B be the block of kΣd with p-core τ . Let

                       λ1 = (τ1 + p, τ2 , . . . , τs ) ☎ λ2 ☎ · · · ☎ λp = (τ, 1p )
be the p partitions of d with p-core τ .
   Let µ = τ ′ + (p). Then µ is p-singular and an easy calculation shows Y µ ⊗ sgn ∼
                                                                                   = D λp−1 ,
i.e. this is the nonprojective twisted Young module in the block. So the signed Young
modules in the block are:

                        D λ1             D λi−1            D λp−1

                                    = D λi D λi−2 , Y λp ∼                    = D λp−1 ,
                        D λ1             D λi−1            D λp−1                 (4.2.4)

where 3 ≤ i < p. Thus the basic algebra for S(m|n, d) is a direct sum of two-sided ideals
which are either semisimple (corresponding to blocks of kΣd of defect 0), or which are
isomorphic to
                                     p

The quiver and relations for the algebra in (4.2.5) is just Ãp which we saw earlier is of finite
type. So we can now prove the first half of Theorem 1.3.1.
(4.2.6) Theorem . Let S(m|n, d) be the Schur superalgebra where 0 ≤ d < 2p.
   (a) S(m|n, d) is semisimple if and only if one of the following holds
         (i) char k = 0;
        (ii) d < p;
       (iii) m = n = 1 and p ∤ d.
   (b) S(m|n, d) has finite representation type but is not semisimple if and only if one of
       the following holds
         (i) p ≤ d < 2p;
        (ii) m = n = 1 and p | d.
Proof. (a) If d < p or char k = 0 then kΣd is semisimple, hence so is the algebra S(m|n, d) :=
EndkΣd (V ⊗d ). Part (iii) follows by Proposition 4.1.1.
   (b) The calculation above shows that S(m|n, d) when max(m, n) ≥ 2 and p ≤ d < 2p has
finite representation type (and is not semisimple). The same is true for S(1|1, d) when p | d
by Proposition 4.1.1.                                                                        


4.3 S(2|1, d), d ≥ 2p :
  In this section we begin to show that for d ≥ 2p the algebra S(2|1, d) has wild type. By
Proposition 3.4.1 it will suffice to prove this for 2p ≤ d < 3p. Recall that:
                                                                           
                                                   M
                     S(2|1, d) ∼
                               = EndkΣ d
                                                            M (λ1 ,λ2 |µ1 )  .
                                              (λ1 ,λ2 |µ1 )∈Λ(2|1,d)

In each case we will find some collection {Yi } of indecomposable signed Young modules
such that the algebra EndkΣd (⊕Yi ) is wild type. But this will imply S(2|1, d) is wild type
by Proposition 3.2.1.
   To show that the algebra EndkΣd (⊕Yi ) has wild type we will show, in each case, that it
is isomorphic to an algebra kQ/I where Q is a quiver and I is an ideal contained in the
ideal generated by paths of length at least two. In each case the separated quiver of Q will
not be a union of Dynkin or extended Dynkin diagrams, which by Gabriel’s theorem means
the algebra is of wild type. The main difficulty will be to make an appropriate choice of
the {Yi }.
   Our proof will split into three cases; each following the same logic. First we handle the
case 2p ≤ d < 3p − 2. Then we handle d = 3p − 2 and d = 3p − 1 separately. That this
happens is not surprising, as the blocks of defect two are slightly different in the three cases,
see for instance Table 1 in [S]. Essentially everything is understood for symmetric group
                                    REPRESENTATION TYPE OF S(m|n, d)                                        13

blocks of defect two. The decomposition numbers are all known by [R]. The structure of
the projective indecomposable modules can be determined from [S]. Finally Chuang and
Tan [CT] have determined the structure of the nonprojective Young modules. Thus we just
need to judiciously select signed Young modules to get a quiver of wild type. We will not
give the details of determining the module structures we need, they can be found in the
works cited above.
   Recall that if λ is a p-regular partition of d, we write m(λ) for the Mullineux conjugate
                                                            ′
of λ, so D λ ⊗ sgn ∼
                   = D m(λ) and the Young module Y m(λ) is the projective cover of D λ .

4.4 S(2|1, d), 2p ≤ d < 3p − 2 : Let d = 2p + t for 0 ≤ t < p − 2. Using the Chuang-Tan
notation we have the following partitions in the principal block of Σd :

   λ(0) = (2p + t), λ(1) = (2p − 1, t + 1),              λ(2) = (2p − 2, t + 1, 1),   λ(∗) = (p + t, p).
                                                                                                           (1)
  If we let σ = (p + t, p − 1, 1) then σ is p-restricted and Y σ is the projective cover of D λ .
                      (i)
Using i to denote D λ we have the following Loewy structures [CT, Thm. 2.4]:

                                         0             1              1
                    λ(0)   ∼      λ(1) ∼       λ(2) ∼         λ(∗) ∼
                Y          = 0, Y      = 1 , Y      = 0 2 , Y      = 0 ∗ ,                          (4.4.1)
                                         0             1              1

                                                           1
                                                     ∗     0     2
                                           Y   σ   ∼
                                                   = 1     µ     1 .
                                                     ∗     0     2
                                                           1
Since all the partitions above have third part zero or one and since by Proposition 3.5.1
Y (a,b,1) is a summand of M (a,b|1) , we know all the modules in (4.4.1) are signed Young
modules for m = 2, n = 1. Consider the following quiver L given below:

                                                            2

Let U be the direct sum of the five modules in (4.4.1). We have:
(4.4.2) Theorem .
   (a) The algebra EndkΣ2p+t (U ) is isomorphic to the algebra kL/I where I is in the ideal
       generated by paths of length two. In particular it is of wild representation type.
   (b) The superalgebra S(2|1, d) has wild representation type for 2p ≤ d < 3p − 2.

Proof. (a) The signed Young modules making up U have the same structure as the modules
Ei for 1 ≤ i ≤ 5 in Prop. 3.10 of [E] and the determination of the quiver proceeds in exactly
the same way.
  (b) This follows immediately from part (a) by calculating the separated quiver of L. The
separated quiver is two copies of:

                                                                      r                r


                                     r             r                  r                r




which is not a Dynkin or Euclidean diagram.                                                                           



4.5 S(2|1, 3p − 2) : Let d = 3p − 2. Using the Chuang-Tan notation we have the following
partitions in the principal block of Σd :

               λ(0) = (3p − 2),           λ(1) = (2p − 1, p − 1),              λ(2) = (2p − 2, p − 2, 12 ),
              λ(3) = (2p − 2, p − 3, 13 ),            λ(∗) = (2p − 2, p),              δ = (2p − 2, p − 1, 1).
It is also an easy calculation that:

                                            m(δ)′ = (2p − 3, p − 1, 12 )
                  2
so Y (2p−3,p−1,1 ) is the projective cover of D δ . Let τ = (2p − 3, p − 1, 12 ). Using i to denote
   (i)
D λ we have the following structures for Young modules [CT]:

   Let T be the direct sum of the six signed Young modules in (4.5.1). Then we have the
following result.
(4.5.2) Theorem .
   (a) The algebra Λ = EndkΣ3p−2 (T ) is isomorphic to the algebra kQ/I where I is the
       ideal generated the relations:
                 α1 α2 = α2 α3 = α2 h = β3 β2 = β2 β1 = β3 g = f α3 = α2 h = 0
                                                                                            (4.5.3)
                                   hk = gf = β1 α2 + α3 β3
   (b) The superalgebra S(2|1, d) has wild representation type for d = 3p − 2.
Proof. (a) Let {e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 , eδ , eτ } ∈ Λ be the canonical projections onto the Young module
summands of T . Choose nonzero maps αi and βi . (The module structures leave no choice
for the kernels and images of these maps). The image and kernels of the maps f, g, h, k
can also be determined by the structure of the modules given in (4.5.1). In particular
we have the following Loewy structures for the kernels (from which the images are easily
determined):

                                                 τ
                     ∗ 0                                                2 0           0
             ker f ∼
                   =     , ker k ∼
                                 = 2             ∗    0 ,       ker g ∼
                                                                      =     , ker h ∼
                                                                                    =
                      1                                                  δ            1
                                                 δ
Knowing the kernels and images of the maps is sufficient to check that the zero relations
in (4.5.3) are satisfied. We need only show we can choose the maps so that hk = gf =
β1 α2 + α3 β3 .
   Notice that the image of β2 α2 is the simple module 1 and the image of α3 β3 is the simple
                                                                        (2)             (2)
module δ while both hk and gh have image equal to the socle of Y λ . Since End(Y λ ) is
three-dimensional, we can take as a basis {e2 , α3 β3 , β2 α2 }. Write:
                                         hk = aβ2 α2 + bα3 β3
                                         gf = cβ2 α2 + cα3 β3
where the images ensure a, b, c, d are all nonzero.
  Now just do the substitutions:
                           β2′ = aβ2 , α′2 = cα2 , β3′ = bβ3 , α′3 = dα4 .
16             DAVID J. HEMMER, JONATHAN KUJAWA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO

  This will give the desired relation without effecting the earlier zero relations. The maps
{αi , βi , h, k, f, g} generate rad Λ and are independent modulo I 2 , so there is an epimorphism
kQ/I onto Λ. Now one can simply check the dimensions agree to obtain the isomorphism.
  (b) This follows immediately from (a) by calculating the separated quiver of Q and
verifying that it is not a Dynkin or Euclidean diagram.                                         

   In the special case where p = 3 (i.e. S(2|1, 7)) the partition λ(3) above does not exist. In
                                                      (3)
this case to obtain the same quiver just replace Y λ by the irreducible module D δ , which
is a signed Young module by Proposition 3.6.1. The quiver and relations are easily seen to
be identical.

4.6 S(2|1, 3p − 1) :
   Let d = 3p − 1. Using the Chuang-Tan notation we have the following partitions in the
principal block of Σd :

           λ(0) = (3p − 1),          λ(1) = (2p − 1, p − 1, 1),        λ(2) = (2p − 1, p − 2, 12 ),
             λ(3) = (2p − 1, p − 3, 13 ),              λ(∗) = (2p − 1, p),       ρ = (2p − 2, p, 1),
                                                                                    (∗)
where ρ = m(λ(∗) )′ , and hence Y ρ is the projective cover of D λ .

  Using i to denote D λ we have the following structures for Young modules [CT]:

   Let W be the direct sum of the six signed Young modules in (4.6.1). Then we have the
following result.
                             REPRESENTATION TYPE OF S(m|n, d)                              17

(4.6.2) Theorem .
   (a) The algebra EndkΣ3p−1 (W ) is isomorphic to the algebra kH/I where I is in the ideal
       generated by paths of length two. In particular it is of wild representation type.
   (b) The superalgebra S(2|1, d) has wild representation type for d = 3p − 1.
Proof. (a) We leave the calculations here for the reader. They are similar to the proof of
Theorem 4.5.2. (b) Once again the separated quiver for H is not Dynkin or Euclidean so
S(2|1, 3p − 1) is of wild representation type.                                          

   Just as in the 3p − 2 case, we remark that the partition λ(3) does not exist when p = 3
                                      (3)                                      (1)
(i.e. S(2|1, 8)). Again, replacing Y λ with the simple module D (5,2,1) ∼= D λ gives the
same quiver. D (5,2,1) is a signed Young module by Proposition 3.6.1.

4.7   We can now complete the proof of Theorem 1.3.1 by proving the following result.
(4.7.1) Theorem . The algebra S(m|n, d) has wild representation type when max(m, n) ≥ 2
and d ≥ 2p.
Proof. Since S(m|n, d) ∼= S(n|m, d) we may assume that m ≥ n. By assumption m ≥
2 and n ≥ 1. The algebra S(2|1, d), 2p ≤ d < 3p has wild representation type from
Theorems 4.4.2(b), 4.5.2(b), 4.6.2(b). Hence, by Proposition 3.4.1, S(2|1, d) has wild type
for d ≥ 2p. One can now apply Corollary 3.3.1(b) to conclude that S(m|n, d) has wild
representation type for d ≥ 2p.                                                           


5 Global Dimension

5.1 In [MZ, Conj. 1] it is conjectured that S(m|n, d) is quasi-hereditary whenever d is
coprime to p. In this section we use our previous calculations to show this is far from true.
In fact, we will prove the following theorem.
(5.1.1) Theorem . For d ≥ p ≥ 5 and m, n ≥ d the superalgebra S(m|n, d) has infinite
global dimension.
  This result suggests the following question.
(5.1.2) Question . Is it true that S(m|n, d) is either semisimple or has infinite global
dimension? In particular, is it true that non-semisimple Schur superalgebras are never
quasi-hereditary?


5.2 Before proving Theorem 5.1.1 we first need to determine which block of kΣd contains a
given signed Young module. Throughout the remainder of this section we assume m, n ≥ d.
   Recall the classification of irreducible S(m|n, d)-supermodules when m, n ≥ d given in
[Do, 2.3 (3)] (for the statement when m, n, and d are arbitrary, see [BK, Thm. 6.5]).
(5.2.1) Theorem . Let m, n ≥ d. The irreducible supermodules of S(m|n, d) are labeled
by heighest weight by the set Λ++ (m|n, d) = {(λ|pµ) | |λ| + p|µ| = d} where λ and µ are
partitions.
18              DAVID J. HEMMER, JONATHAN KUJAWA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO

Write L(λ|pµ) for the irreducible S(m|n, d)-supermodule of highest weight (λ|pµ) and let
P (λ|pµ) denote the projective cover of L(λ|pµ).
   Just as with the ordinary Schur algebra, one can define a Schur functor
                          F : S(m|n, d)-supermodules → kΣd -modules.
Like with the ordinary Schur functor, F is exact and if L is an irreducible S(m|n, d)-
supermodule then F L is either zero or an irreducible kΣd -module. All irreducible kΣd -
modules appear in this way. In fact, by [BK, (5.13)] we have
                              (       ′
                           ∼    D m(λ ) , if |µ| = 0 and λ′ is p-regular;
                 F L(λ|pµ) =                                                     (5.2.2)
                                0,        otherwise.
Furthermore, by [Do, p. 662] we have
                                          F P (λ|pµ) ∼
                                                     = Y (λ|pµ) .                               (5.2.3)
Thus to determine which block contains Y (λ|pµ) it will suffice to obtain information about
the composition factors of P (λ|pµ).
  Before proceeding, we require additional notation. Let
                  X = {ξ = (ξ1 , . . . , ξm |ξm+1 , . . . , ξm+n ) | ξ1 , . . . , ξm+n ∈ Z} .
We view (λ|pµ) ∈ Λ++ (m|n, d) as an element of X in the natural way as (λ, 0, . . . , 0|pµ, 0, . . . , 0).
For i = 1, . . . , m + n, let εi ∈ X be the element which has a 1 in the ith position and 0’s
elsewhere. Let ϑ ∈ X be the element
                  ϑ = (−1, −2, . . . , −m|m − 1, m − 2, . . . , m − n + 1, m − n).
Note that our definition of ϑ differs from the one in [K, (2.8)] by a multiple of the GL(m|n)
analogue of the determinant representation. This has no significant effect on our arguments.
  Given i = 1, . . . , m + n we define ri : X → Z by
                                  (
                                   ξi + ϑi ,    if i = 1, . . . , m;
                         ri (ξ) =
                                   −(ξi + ϑi ), if i = m + 1, . . . , m + n.
For r ∈ Zp and ξ ∈ X, define
                     Ar (ξ) = |{i = 1, . . . , m + n | ri (ξ + εi ) ≡ r (mod p)}|,
                     Br (ξ) = |{i = 1, . . . , m + n | ri (ξ) ≡ r (mod p)}|.
   For a partition λ we let λ̃ denote its p-core. Recall that the blocks of kΣd are parame-
terized by the p-cores of the partitions of d [JK, Sect. 2.7]. Also recall that the category of
S(m|n, d)-supermodules is equivalent to the category of polynomial representations of degree
d for the supergroup GL(m|n). That is we can view the category of S(m|n, d)-supermodules
as a full subcategory of the category of representations of GL(m|n) and, in turn, as a full
subcategory of the category of supermodules for the superalgebra Dist(GL(m|n)) of distri-
butions for GL(m|n). See [BK] for a full discussion of these matters.
(5.2.4) Lemma . If L(λ|pµ) and L(ν|pη) have the same central character as Dist(GL(m|n))-
supermodules, then λ̃ = ν̃.
                               REPRESENTATION TYPE OF S(m|n, d)                                       19

Proof. If L(λ|pµ) and L(ν|pη) have the same central character, then by [K, Lem. 3.3] we
have
                         Ar (λ|pµ) − Br (λ|pµ) = Ar (ν|pη) − Br (ν|pη)                        (5.2.5)
for all r ∈ Zp . However, note that if i = m + 1, . . . , m + n, then
                                   ri (λ|pµ) ≡ −ϑi (mod p)
                                             ≡ ri (ν|pη) (mod p),
and
                           ri ((λ|pµ) + εi ) ≡ −ϑi − 1 (mod p)
                                             ≡ ri ((ν|pη) + εi ) (mod p).
Consequently, we see that (5.2.5) holds if and only if
                         A′r (λ|pµ) − Br′ (λ|pµ) = A′r (ν|pη) − Br′ (ν|pη)                    (5.2.6)
for all r ∈ Zp , where for ξ ∈ X we define
                       A′r (ξ) = |{i = 1, . . . , m | ri (ξ + εi ) ≡ r (mod p)}|,
                       Br′ (ξ) = |{i = 1, . . . , m | ri (ξ) ≡ r (mod p)}|.
  Given (λ|pµ) and r ∈ Zp , for brevity let us write A′r for A′r (λ|pµ) and Br′ for Br′ (λ|pµ).
By definition, we have A′r = Br−1
                               ′  for all r ∈ Zp . We then have the following equations in
     ′
the Br ’s:
                          B1′ + B2′ + · · · + Bp′ = m
                                      ′
                                     Br−1 − Br′ =: br (for r = 1, . . . , p).
However, a straightforward check verifies that the determinant for this system of linear
equations is nonzero so one can solve this system for the Br′ ’s. That is, (5.2.6) holds if and
only if
                                       Br′ (λ|pµ) = Br′ (ν|pη)                                (5.2.7)
for all r ∈ Zp . At this point we assume without loss that |λ| = |ν| since          Br′ (λ, 1p |pµ)=
   ′                                          p
Br (λ|pµ) and since the p-cores of (λ, 1 ) and λ coincide.
     Since for i = 1, . . . , m we have ri (λ|pµ) = λi − i, it follows that (5.2.7) holds if and only
if there is an element σ ∈ Σm so that
                                   λi − i ≡ νσ(i) − σ(i) (mod p)                              (5.2.8)
for all i = 1, . . . , m. Finally, by the Nakayama Rule [Mar, Thm. 5.1.1] we have that (5.2.8)
holds if and only if λ̃ = ν̃. This proves the desired result.                                

(5.2.9) Corollary . The signed Young module Y (λ|pµ) is in the kΣd block with p-core λ̃.
Proof. Let L(ν|pη) be a composition factor of P (λ|pµ). Then since both L(λ|pµ) and L(ν|pη)
are composition factors of an indecomposible Dist(GL(m|n))-supermodule, they must have
the same central characters (c.f. [K, Sect. 2.8]). By the previous lemma, we have that
λ̃ = ν̃. The result then follows by exactness of the Schur functor along with (5.2.2) and
(5.2.3).                                                                                  

5.3 We can now prove Theorem 5.1.1. Since p ≥ 5 there must be a partition τ ⊢ d − p
which is a p-core by the work of Granville and Ono [GO]. Consequently, Σd has a p-block
of defect one. Let B denote this block.
(5.3.1) Lemma . There are p + 1 signed Young modules in B. They are the p distinct
Young modules Y (λ|∅) ∼      = Y λ with λ̃ = τ and one non-projective twisted Young module
               ′ +p)
Y (τ |p) ∼
         =Y (τ       ⊗ sgn .
Proof. By Corollary 5.2.9 the signed Young modules which occur in B are those of the form
Y (λ|pµ) with λ̃ = τ . That is, precisely those listed. Now, since twisted Young modules are
                                      ′
signed Young modules, we have Y (τ +p) ⊗ sgn is a signed Young module in the block B, and
it must be Y (τ |p) .                                                                     

Now we have the direct sum decomposition
                                                                             
                                                          M
         S(m|n, d) = EndkΣd V ⊗d ∼
                                 = EndkΣd                       a(λ|µ) Y (λ|µ)  ⊕ EndkΣd (U )
                                                         Y (λ|µ) ∈B
where a(λ|µ) denotes the multiplicity of Y     (λ|µ)   in V ⊗d and
                                                         U has no summands in the block
B. That is, we have direct sum decomposition of S(m|n, d) into graded two-sided ideals,
one of which is Morita equivalent to
                                                     
                                           M
                                 EndΣd       Y (λ|µ)  .
                                               Y (λ|µ) ∈B

This is precisely the situation of (4.2.4) and the quiver is just Ãp . It is easy to see this (su-
per)algebra has infinite global dimension. The projective resolutions of the simple modules
are all periodic and do not terminate. Since a two-sided graded ideal has infinite global
dimension, so does S(m|n, d), proving Theorem 5.1.1.
