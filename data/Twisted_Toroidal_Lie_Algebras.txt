                                                      Using n finite order automorphisms on a simple complex Lie algebra we construct
                                                   twisted n-toroidal Lie algebras. Thus obtaining Lie algebras wich have a rootspace
                                                   decomposition. For the case n = 2 we list certain simple Lie algebras and their
                                                   automorphisms, which produce twisted 2-toroidal algebras. In this way we obtain Lie
                                                   algebras that are related to all Extended Affine Root Systems of K. Saito.


                                             1    Introduction
                                             At the end of the 1960’s Victor Kac [20] and Bob Moody [25] independently realized that
                                             one could generalize Serre’s construction of simple Lie algebras to construct certain infinite-
                                             dimensional Lie algebras, that posess root systems. A special class of these Kac-Moody
                                             (Lie) algebras were related to the affine root systems. These affine Lie algebras could
                                             also be constructed in an explicit way. Nowadays this construction is well known. These
                                             algebras are the central extensions of so-called twisted and untwisted loop algebras. The
                                             untwisted loop algebras g̃ can be obtained as follows. Let ġ be a finite dimensional simple
                                             Lie algebra, then g̃ = ġ ⊗ C[t, t−1 ], where C[t, t−1 ] is the algebra of Laurent polynomials
                                             in the variable t. The twisted loop algebras can be obtained as certain subalgebras of
                                             the untwisted ones. Let σ be a certain finite order automorphism induced by a diagram
                                             automorphism of the Dynkin diagram (see [21] for more details). Then ġ decomposes into
                                             eigenspaces with respect to this automorphism. To be more precise, let n be the order of
                                                                           2πi
                                             the automorphism and ǫ = e n
                                                                                       M
                                                                                 ġ =       ġk , where
                                                                                     k∈Z/nZ

                                                                               ġk = {g ∈ ġ|σ(g) = ǫk g}.

                                             The twisted loop algebra is the following subalgebra of g̃
                                                                                         M
                                                                                 g̃(σ) =   ġk ⊗ tk .
                                                                                          k∈Z



                                                                                           1

A generalization of this construction, at least of the untwisted ones is clearly obvious.
Instead of tensoring by the algebra of Laurent polynomials in one variable, one can take
Laurent polynomials in N variables tj . Thus obtaining toroidal Lie algebras. Unfortu-
nately, these Lie algebras are not Kac-Moody algebras, but they still are very interesting
and obviously related to certain extensions of affine root systems. They appeared in the
work of Slodowy [30] as certain intersection matrix algebras.
    K. Saito, interested in singularity theory and inspired by the work of Looijenga [23],
[24] and Slodowy [29], [30], classified in [27] extended affine root systems, whose rad-
ical is 2-dimensional and for which the quotient of the root system modulo a certain
1-dimensional space is reduced. In 1997 Allison, Azam, Berman, Gao and Pianzola [1]
had a different approach, they classified these root systems using semilattices. The Lie
algebras corresponding to these root systems, so-called extended affine Lie algebras or
more precise bi-affine Lie algebras, were constructed in a paper by Hoegh–Krohn and
Torresani [14]. However, their construction was not complete. Pollmann gave a complete
construction in [26], which was based on the idea of twisting affine Lie algebras by finite
order automorphism. This idea was presented in [14] and also in an unpublished paper of
Wakimoto [31]. Although one obtains in this way the bi-affine algebras as subalgebras of
2-toroidal Lie algebras, the grading with respect to the variables of the Laurent polynomi-
als is not so nice. The present paper constructs the same Lie algebras also as subalgebras
of 2-toroidal Lie algebras, but in a slightly different way. Whereas [14], [26] and [31] use
finite order automorphisms of affine Lie algebras to construct the bi-affine Lie algebras,
we use two finite order automorphisms of a simple finite dimensional Lie algebra, which
commute and thus are simultaniously diagonalizable, to construct them. This construction
generalizes in a different way than the construction of [26] the construction of the twisted
affine Lie algebras. This is an experimental fact, unfortunately, at this moment there is no
general theory or classification which explains this phenomenon. Note that in some cases
one uses only inner automorphisms. Our construction also easily generalizes to twisted
N -toroidal Lie algebras, whereas the generalization of the method of [14], [26] and [31] is
somewhat more complicated. A general, but different and more abstract, construction of
these extended affine Lie algebras is given in the AMS Memoir [1] and in [2].
    The theory of vertex operator constructions of untwisted toroidal Lie algebras is well
developed [4], [6], [12], [13], [28], [32] and applied to hierarchies of soliton equations [7],
[15], [18], [19]. We hope that the construction given in Section 3 can be used to define
vertex operator constructions on twisted bi-affine and extended affine algebras.
    Untwisted toroidal Lie algebras appear as current algebras of the symmetry of Kähler–
Wess–Zumino–Witten models [16], [17]. This is an extension of (2-dimensional) Wess–
Zumino–Witten models on a 2n-dimensional Kähler manifold. As such it is one possible
candidate of a construction of integrable quantum field theories in more than two dimen-
sions.
    The decomposition of some of the exceptional Lie algebras with respect to the au-
tomorphisms were checked by Willem de Graaf using GAP – Groups, Algorithms, and
Programming [11]. It is a pleasure to thank him and Prof. P. Slodowy. The latter for
sending the manuscript [26].


2    Extended Affine Root Systems
The following definition of an extended reduced root system can be found in [27], this
definition is different from the one in [1], there also the isotropic roots and 0 are included

in the definition.

Definition 2.1 Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space with a positive semidefinite
symmetric bilinear form (·, ·)V . A subset R of V , with is called an extended reduced root
system in V if R satisfies the following axioms:
                                     P
   • The additve subgroup Q(R) = α∈R Zα of V is a full lattice of V , i.e. R ⊗R Q(R) ≃

   • If α ∈ R, then 2α 6∈ R,

   • For any α ∈ R, Wα (R) = R, where

     nonempty, satisfying (R1 , R2 )V = 0,

The dimension ν of the radical

                             V 0 = {v ∈ V |(v, w)V = 0 for all w ∈ V },

is called the nullity of the root system R. For ν = 2, Saito [27] classified all marked
extended affine root systems. Roughly speaking he considered a 1-dimensional marking,
which is a linear subspace W ⊂ V 0 and considered the induced space V /W and corre-
sponding induced root system. Now assuming that this induced root system is a reduced
(possibly affine) root system, he obtained the following list. See [27] or [26] for a more
precise statement. We write R(Xℓ ) for the root system of a finite type Xℓ .

3    Toroidal Algebras
                                                                                         (1,1)
Lie algebras corresponding to the extended affine root systems of type Xℓ     can be easily
constructed as follows. Let ġ be a simple finite-dimensional complex Lie algebra with (·, ·)
the symmetric non-degenerate invariant Killing form. Let Ṙ be its root system. Choose
an integer N ≥ 1 and consider the tensor product g̃ = ġ ⊗ R of ġ with the algebra of
Laurent polynomials in N + 1 variables:

                                        R = C[t±1   ±1           ±1
                                               0 , t1 , . . . , tn ]

The toroidal Lie algebra corresponding to ġ is the universal central extension of g̃. The
explicit construction of this extension, which we will present now, is known from the papers
[22], [13], see also [3]. Let K = Ω1R /dR be the space of 1-forms modulo the exact forms.
We write f dg for the element of K corresponding to the pair of elements f, g from R and
denote ki = t−1i dti . Thus, K is spanned by elements of the form
                                                 mN
                            tm ki = tm0 m1
                                     0 t1 . . . tN ki ,             0 ≤ i ≤ N,

where m = (m0 , m1 , ..., mN ) ∈ ZN +1 . Exactness implies that these elements are related
by
                                 N
                                 X
                                        mp tm kp = 0,       m ∈ ZN +1 .                                  (3.1)
                                 p=0

Then the toroidal Lie algebra is the vector space ĝ = g̃ ⊕ K whith Lie bracket:

              [g1 ⊗ f1 (t), g2 ⊗ f2 (t)] = [g1 , g2 ] ⊗ f1 (t)f2 (t) + (g1 , g2 )f2 d(f1 ).              (3.2)
                                                                                                 (1,1)
Now, if N = 1, this clearly gives a Lie algebra whose root system is of type Xℓ , viz.,
the root space corresponding to mδ0 + nδ1 + α, with α ∈ Ṙ is ĝmδ0 +nδ1 +α = ġα ⊗ tm  n
                                                                                     0 t1 .
   It is sometimes usefull to add certain outer derivations to the algebra ĝ. To do that,
we consider the following algebra of derivations:
                                                    N
                                                    X
                                             D=           Rdp ,                                          (3.3)
                                                    p=0

where dj = tj ∂t∂j . These derivations extend to derivations of the Lie algebra ġ ⊗ R. Since,
ĝ is the universal central extension of g̃, we can lift these derivations to this universal
central extension by using a result of [5]. The action of vector fields on functions and the
Lie derivative action of vector fields on 1-forms leads to the following action of D on ĝ:

                        [tm dj , g ⊗ tr ] = rj g ⊗ tm+r ,
                                                                    N
                            m       r              m+r
                                                                    X                                    (3.4)
                           [t dj , t ki ] = rj t         ki + δji         mp tm+r kp .
                                                                    p=0

The formulas (3.4) determine the Lie product on D up to a K-valued 2-cocycle τ ∈
H 2 (D, K):

                    [tm di , tr dj ] = ri tm+r dj − mj tm+r di + τ (tm di , tr dj ).                     (3.5)
3 TOROIDAL ALGEBRAS                                                                                                 6


From the results of [10], any cocycle on D with values in K is a linear combination of
                                                 N
                                                 X                                        N
                                                                                          X
                   τ1 (tm di , tr dj ) = mj ri          rp tm+r kp = −mj ri                     mp tm+r kp ,   (3.6)
                                                  p=0                                     p=0

and
                                                                      N
                                                                      X
                                  τ2 (tm di , tr dj ) = mi rj                 m0 tm+r kp .                     (3.7)
                                                                      p=0

So we obtain the two-parametric family of algebras of [3]:

                 gD = gD
                       τ = ĝ ⊕ D = ġ ⊗ R ⊕ K ⊕ D,                              where τ = µτ1 + ντ2 .

We denote by g the following subalgebra of gD :
                                               N
                                               M                                          N
                                                                                          M
                            g = ĝ ⊕ D ⊕             Cdj = ġ ⊗ R ⊕ K ⊕                         Cdj .
                                               j=0                                        j=0

    Note that the advantage of this larger Lie algebra is that the center of the algebra g
and gD is finite-dimensional and is spanned by k0 , k1 , . . . , kN , whereas the center of g̃ is
infinite dimensional.
    Let Σ = {σ0 , σ1 , . . . , σN } be a collection of finite order automorphisms of ġ. N.B.,
we do not assume that all σj are different and we allow σj to be the identity. Let nj
                               n
be the order of σj , i.e., σj j = 1 for the smallest positive integer nj and denote by ǫj =
exp 2πi
     nj . Then every σj is diagonalizable and one can decompose ġ in eigenspaces for the
eigenvalues ǫkj , k ∈ Z/nj Z. Assume from now on that all σj , 0 ≤ j ≤ N are simultaniously
diagonalizable, i.e., one has the following eigenspace decompostion of ġ. Let Z be the
Cartesian product

                            Z = Z/n0 Z × Z/n1 Z × Z/n2 Z × · · · × Z/nN Z,

then
                                                  M
                                     ġ =                         ġ(k0 ,k1 ··· ,kN ) ,    where
                                            (k0 ,k1 ··· ,kN )∈Z
                                                                                                               (3.8)
                                                                      k
                       ġ(k0 ,k1 ··· ,kN ) = {g ∈ ġ|σj (g) =        ǫj j g   for all 0 ≤ j ≤ N }.

     The Killing form (·, ·) is Aut ġ-invariant, hence for every 0 ≤ j ≤ N and all x ∈
ġ(k0 ,k1 ··· ,kN ) and y ∈ ġ(ℓ0 ,ℓ1 ··· ,ℓN ) :
                                                                              k +ℓj
                                 (x, y) = (σj (x), (σj (y)) = ǫj j                    (x, y).

from which we conclude part (a) of the following Lemma:

Lemma 3.1 (a) Let (·, ·) be the Killing form on ġ, then
                                           
  ġ(k0 ,k1 ··· ,kN ) , ġ(ℓ0 ,ℓ1 ··· ,ℓN ) = 0 if (k0 + ℓ0 , k1 + ℓ1 · · · , kN + ℓN ) 6= (0, 0, · · · , 0) ∈ Z.

(b) The subalgebra ġ(0,0,··· ,0) is reductive.

Proof Part (b) of the Lemma is a direct consequence of part (a), the fact that the Killing
form is nondegenerate and Proposition 5 in §6.4 of [8].                                 

This simple observation makes it possible to define twisted toroidal subalgebras of a
toroidal algebra. This construction, which we shall give now, is similar to the one that
produces the twisted affine Lie algebras (see [21], Chapter 8). But before we can do that,
we will first introduce one more notation. Let m = (m0 , m1 , ..., mN ) ∈ ZN +1 , then we
write

          m = (m0 , m1 , ..., mN ) = (m0 modn0 , m1 modn1 , ..., mN modnn ) ∈ Z.

   Fix Σ, we define the subalgebra g̃(Σ) of g̃ by
                                         M
                               g̃(Σ) =           ġm ⊗ tm .                                   (3.9)
                                                 m∈ZN+1

Using Lemma 3.1, one easily sees that one gets a subalgebra of ĝ, which is a central
extension of g̃, if we add the subspace K(Σ) ⊂ K, which is spanned by elements of the
form

                             t0n0 m0 tn1 1 m1 . . . tm
                                                     N
                                                       N mN
                                                            ki ,   0 ≤ i ≤ N,

where of course the relation (3.1) still holds. So define the following subalgebra of ĝ

                                        ĝ(Σ) = g̃(Σ) ⊕ K(Σ),                                (3.10)

with Lie bracket on this algebra still defined by (3.2). We can extend this twisted algebra
with an algebra of derivations, however, except when all automorphisms are the identity,
not with D, but with a subalgebra of D. Let
                       N
                       X                                                            ±nN
              D(Σ) =         R(Σ)dp ,         where R(Σ) = C[t0±n0 , t1±n1 , . . . tN   ],   (3.11)
                       p=0

define a subalgebra gD (Σ) of gD and a subalgebra g(Σ) of g by

                 gD (Σ) = gD
                           τ (Σ) = ĝ(Σ) ⊕ D(Σ) = g̃(Σ) ⊕ K(Σ) ⊕ D(Σ),
                                 MN                        N
                                                           M
                  g(Σ) = ĝ(Σ) ⊕      Cdj = g̃(Σ) ⊕ K(Σ) ⊕    Cdj ,
                                        j=0                              j=0

where the Lie bracket is still defined by (3.2), (3.4) and (3.5).
   Let ḣ0 be the Cartan subalgebra of ġ(0,0,... ,0) , then

                h = ḣ0 ⊕ Cd0 ⊕ Cd1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ CdN ⊕ Ck0 ⊕ Ck1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ CkN

is the Cartan subalgebra of gD (Σ) and g(Σ). We extend λ ∈ ḣ∗0 to a linear function on h
by setting λ(di ) = λ(ki ) = 0, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ N . Denote by δi , κi the linear function on h
defined by

                          δi (ḣ0 ) = 0,       δi (dj ) = δij , δi (κj ) = 0,
                          κi (ḣ0 ) = 0,       κi (dj ) = 0, κi (κj ) = δij .
3 TOROIDAL ALGEBRAS                                                                                      8


The Killing form restricted to ḣ0 remains nondegenerate and can be extended to a non-
degenerate symmetric bilinear form on h
            (ki , kj ) = 0,   (di , kj ) = δij ,   (di , dj ) = 0,    (ki , ḣ0 ) = (di , ḣ0 ) = 0.
This form defines an isomorphism h → h∗ by
                                 ν(h)(h′ ) = (h, h′ ),          h, h′ ∈ h0
and hence a bilinear form on h∗ , viz.,
                                      (α, β) = (ν −1 (α), ν −1 (β)).
One thus has
            (κi , κj ) = 0,   (δi , κj ) = δij ,   (δi , δj ) = 0,    (κi , ḣ∗0 ) = (δi , ḣ0∗ ) = 0.
Then, g(Σ) decomposes with respect to h∗ into
                                         M
                                 g(Σ) =       g(Σ)α .
                                                     α∈h∗

Let
                                     ∆ = {α ∈ h∗ |g(Σ)α 6= {0}},
be the set of roots of g(Σ) then we have the following root space decomposition
                                              M
                                  g(Σ) = h ⊕      g(Σ)α .
                                                       α∈∆

The connection with the extended affine root system of Section 2 is as follows. The linear
space V in Definition 2.1, is the subspace
                                                        N
                                                        M
                                           V = ḣ0∗ ⊕         Cδi ,
                                                        i=0

and the bilinear form of the definition is the restriction (·, ·)V of (·, ·) to V . One can
decompose g(Σ) with respect to V into
                                           M
                                   g(Σ) =      g(Σ)α .
                                                     α∈V

Let
                                     R = {α ∈ V |g(Σ)α 6= {0}},
then
         R = R ∪ R0 ,         where R = {α ∈ R|(α, α)V 6= 0}                  and R0 = R ∩ V 0
and thus
                                               M                M
                               g(Σ) = h ⊕            g(Σ)α ⊕          g(Σ)α .
                                               α∈R             α∈R0

    Note that there is one problem, for general Σ, it is not clear that the set R satisfies the
axioms of Definition 2.1. In the next section we choose N = 1 and list pairs ġ, Σ which
give the extended affine Lie algebras that correspond to the extended affine root systems
of Saito [27], i.e., to the ones that were presented in section 2.
4 BI-AFFINE LIE ALGEBRAS                                                                     9


4     Bi-affine Lie Algebras
In this section we construct the bi-affine Lie algebras, i.e., the twisted 2-toroidal Lie
algebras corresponding to the the extended affine root systems of Saito [27], which were
presented in Section 2. So we assume from now on in this section that N = 1. In most
cases we will explain how we realize ġ, this will however not always be the same, e.g. the
Lie algebra of type Dℓ will be realized in different ways.

                (1,1)
4.1   Type Xℓ
                                   (1,1)
Bi-affine Lie algebras of type Xℓ , can be easily constructed. One takes in the con-
struction of section 3 for ġ the simple Lie algebra of type Xℓ and as automorphisms
σ0 = σ1 = id.

                (1,t)
4.2   Type Xℓ
                                                            (1,t)
The description of the bi-affine Lie algebras of type Xℓ     is also easy. For Xℓ equal to
Bℓ , Cℓ , F4 and G2 , one takes as ġ the simple Lie algebra of type Dℓ+1 , A2ℓ−1 , E6 , D4 ,
respectively. One chooses for σ0 the identity and for σ1 the automorphisms, described in
§8 of [21], which are induced by a diagram automorphism. The order of σ2 is t, which is
equal to 2, 2, 2, 3, respectively.

                (t,t)
4.3   Type Xℓ
We start this subsection with the Xℓ = Bℓ and t = 2. We take as ġ the Lie algebra of
type Dℓ+2 . Let Mn be the linear space of all complex n × n-matrices. We realize ġ as

                               ġ = {X ∈ M2ℓ+4 |X T = −X},                                (4.1)

the (i, j)-th entry and zeros elsewhere. Now choose Σ as follows

The subalgebra ġ(0,0) is the simple Lie algebra of type Bℓ . All three other spaces consist of
the direct sum of a 1-dimensional trivial and a 2ℓ+1-dimensional irreducible representation
of Bℓ .
    Next we take Xℓ = Cℓ and t = 2. In this case ġ is the Lie algebra of type D2ℓ , which
we realize as

The automorphisms are defined as follows
                                      4ℓ

                                      i=1
Here ġ(0,0) is the simple Lie algebra of type Cℓ . All three other spaces consist of the direct
sum of a 1-dimensional trivial and a 2ℓ2 − ℓ − 1-dimensional irreducible representation of
Bℓ .
     Assum now that Xℓ = F4 , then t = 2. Now ġ is the Lie algebra of type E7 , and
assume that the roots are labeled as ”Planche VI” in [9]. Let ei , fi , 1 ≤ i ≤ 7 be the
Chevalley generators corresponding to these roots. We define both automorphisms on
these generators.
             σ0 (ei ) = ei , σ0 (fi ) = fi for i = 2, 4,
             σ0 (e1 ) = e6 , σ0 (f1 ) = f6 ,
             σ0 (e3 ) = e5 , σ0 (f3 ) = f5 ,
             σ0 (e5 ) = e3 , σ0 (f5 ) = f3 ,
             σ0 (e6 ) = e1 , σ0 (f6 ) = f1 ,
            σ0 (e7 ) = e−θ = [f1 f3 f4 f2 f5 f4 f6 f5 f3 f4 f2 f1 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 ],   σ0 (f7 ) = eθ ,
where [ab . . . cd] stands for [a, [b. . . . , [c, d]]] . . . ]. Here eθ is a root vector corresponding to
the highest root and e−θ is a root vector corresponding to the lowest root. Of course eθ
has to be normalized in such a way that σ0 is an automorphism of order 2.
                                   σ1 (ei ) = ei , σ1 (fi ) = fi for i 6= 7
                                σ1 (e7 ) = −e7 , σ1 (f7 ) = −f7 .
Then with respect to these two automorphisms ġ splits into the following spaces ġ(0,0) is
the simple Lie algebra of type F4 and all the spaces ġ(0,1) , ġ(1,0) and ġ(1,1) is the direct sum
of a 1-dimensional trivial representation and the 26-dimensional irreducible representation
of F4 . This was checked using GAP – Groups, Algorithms, and Programming [11].
                            (3,3)
    Finally, we describe G2 . For this case ġ is the Lie algebra of type E6 . We define
the automorphisms again on the Chevalley generators,where the roots are numbered as in
”Planche V” of [9]. Let θ be the highest root of E6 , now define
                     σ0 (e1 ) = e6 , σ0 (f1 ) = f6 ,
                     σ0 (e2 ) = e3 , σ0 (f2 ) = f3 ,
                     σ0 (e3 ) = e5 , σ0 (f3 ) = f5 ,
                     σ0 (e4 ) = e4 , σ0 (f4 ) = f4 ,

                    σ0 (e6 ) = e−θ = [f2 f4 f5 f3 f4 f2 f6 f5 f4 f3 f1 ],      σ0 (f7 ) = eθ ,

which is an automorphism of order 3. Let ω = e                 3     , define σ1 as follows:
                             σ1 (ei ) = ei , σ1 (fi ) = fi for i 6= 1, 6,
                            σ1 (ei ) = ωei , σ1 (fi ) = ω 2 fi . for i = 1, 6.
The 78-dimensional Lie algebra E6 splits with respect to these automorphisms as follows:
ġ(0,0) is the simple Lie algebra of type G2 , all 8 other spaces ġ(i,j) , 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 2, (i, j) 6= (0, 0)
is the direct sum of the irreducible 7-dimensional representation and a 1-dimensional trivial
representation of G2 . This example was also checked using GAP [11].

4.4    Type A1
We will not describe the bi-affine Lie algebra of this type here, but instead we will obtain
it as a special case of the construction of the next section.

4.5    Type Bℓ
                                                                     (2,2)∗
The construction of the bi-affine Lie algebra of type Bℓ       goes as follows. The algebra
ġ is the simple Lie algebra of type Bℓ+1 , which we realize as the space of anti-symmetric
matrices (cf. (4.1)):

                                 ġ = {X ∈ M2ℓ+3 |X T = −X}.

The automorphisms are taken as follows:
                                                    2ℓ+2

                                                                         2ℓ+1
                                                                                      !
                                                                         X
                          σ1 =Ad −E2ℓ+2,2ℓ+2 + E2ℓ+3,2ℓ+3 +                     Eii       .
                                                                         i=1

                                                                              (1,1)∗
If we take ℓ = 1, we obtain the bi-affine Lie algebra of type A1       .
    Here ġ(0,0) is the simple Lie algebra of type Bℓ . The spaces ġ(0,1) and ġ(1,0) consist of
a 2ℓ + 1-dimensional irreducible representation of Bℓ and ġ(1,1) is one dimensional.

                 (1,1)∗
4.6    Type Cℓ
                                                  (1,1)∗
To obtain the bi-affine Lie algebra of type Cℓ      we choose ġ to be the simple Lie algebra
of type C2ℓ . This Lie algebra is realized as follows (cf. (4.2)):
                                                                

                        ġ =                 ∈ M4ℓ |b = b, c = c .
                                 c −aT

The automorphisms σ0 and σ1 are defined by (4.3). Now, ġ(0,0) is the simple Lie algebra of
type Cℓ .Both spaces ġ(0,1) and ġ(1,0) are the adjoint representation and ġ(1,1) consist of the
direct sum of a 2ℓ2 − ℓ − 1-dimensional irreducible representation and a one dimensional
one.

                   (2,1)
4.7    Type BCℓ
This type can be described in the same way as the examples of Section 4.2. Here ġ is
the Lie algebra of type A2ℓ . Let σ0 be the automorphism, described in §8 of [21], which
                                         (2)
produces the affine Lie algebra of type A2ℓ , for σ1 we choose the identity.

                   (2,2)
4.8    Type BCℓ            (1)
                                    (2,1)
The bi-affine algebra of type BCℓ           is constructed by taking as ġ the simple Lie algebra
of type D2ℓ+1 , realized as

                                 ġ = {X ∈ M4ℓ+2 |X T = −X}.
4 BI-AFFINE LIE ALGEBRAS                                                                       12


In this case Σ is given by
                                          4ℓ+2
                                                                  !

                                 σ0 =Ad          (−)i Ei,4ℓ+3−i       ,
                                           i=1
                                          2ℓ+1

                                 σ1 =Ad          Ei,i − E2ℓ+1+i,2ℓ+1+i        .
                                          i=1
In this example is ġ(0,0) the simple Lie algebra of type Bℓ . Both spaces ġ(0,1) and ġ(1,1) are
the adjoint representation and ġ(1,0) consist of the direct sum of a 2ℓ2 + 3ℓ-dimensional
irreducible representation and a one dimensional one.

                   (2,2)
4.9    Type BCℓ            (2)
          (2,2)
Type BCℓ (2) can be obtained by choosing ġ the simple Lie algebra of type A2ℓ+1 . We
realize this Lie algebra in the usual way as the traceless (2ℓ + 2) × (2ℓ + 2)-matrices. σ0
is the Cartan involution
                           σ0 (X) = −X T and
                                                       2ℓ+1
                                                                !
                                                        X
                               σ1 = Ad −E2ℓ+2,2ℓ+2 +        Ei,i .
                                                                    i=1
For the decomposition of this Lie algebra we refer the reader to the second example of
Section 5.

                    (2,4)
4.10    Type BCℓ
                                                      (2,4)
Finally, the bi-affine Lie algebra of type BCℓ    is constructed as follows. The algebra ġ
is the Lie algebra of type D2ℓ+2 , which we realize as in (4.2), but then with 4ℓ replaced
by 4ℓ + 4. The automorphism σ0 is the involution
                                                                                   
                                           2ℓ+1
                                            X
      σ0 = Ad E2ℓ+2,4ℓ+4 − E4ℓ+4,2ℓ+2 +       (−)j E4ℓ+4−j,j − (−)j E2ℓ+2−j,2ℓ+2+j  .
                                                   j=1

The other automorphism is an automorphism of order 4:
                                                                          
                                                2ℓ+1
                                                X
           σ1 = Ad iE2ℓ+2,2ℓ+4 + iE2ℓ+4,2ℓ+2 +      Ej,j − E2ℓ+2+j,2ℓ+2+j  .
                                                              j=1

The decomposition of D2ℓ+2 with respect to the automorphisms is the most complicated
one. The subalgebra ġ(0,0) the simple Lie algebra of type Bℓ . The spaces ġ(i,j) , where
(i, j) = (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 3) or (1, 3) are all irreducible 2ℓ + 1 dimensional representations
of Bℓ. Next, ġ(1,0) is the direct sum of a one dimensional and the 2ℓ2 + 3ℓ-dimensional
irreducible representation of Bℓ ; ġ(0,2) is the ad-module (the adjoint representation) and
ġ(1,2) is again the direct sum of two irreducible modules, viz. the adjoint representation
and a one dimensional trivial one.
                                                                                             (t,1)
      This produces all bi-affine Lie algebras related to Saito’s list. The ones of type Xℓ
                                          (1,t)
are isomorphic to the ones of type Xℓ . The former can be constructed by interchanging
the automorphisms σ1 and σ2 in the construction of latter. Except for two cases, viz.,
   (1,1)∗       (1,1)∗
A1        and Cℓ       , the tier numbers, introduced by Saito, which are the upper indeces in
    (s,t)
Xℓ , equal the order of the automorphims used to construct the bi-affine lie algebras.

5    Some quasi-simple Lie algebras
In 1990 Hoegh-Krohn and Torresani [14] classified and constructed certain quasi-simple
Lie algebras. These are characterized by the existence of a finite-dimensional Cartan
subalgebra, a nondegenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form and nilpotent root spaces
attached to non-isotropic roots. They derive a classification for the possible irreducible
elliptic quasi-simple root systems. Obviously they were not aware of the existence of the
paper of Saito [27], which appeared 5 years earlier. In the case when the nullity is equal to

this was caused by the fact that they assumed or erroneously concluded that the theory
governing the isotropic roots was based on lattices. Two of their examples were the root

    Using the idea’s of Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.9 we construct the corresponding extended affine
algebra related to (5.1) for Xℓ = Bℓ and to (5.2). This shows that the approach of this
paper, not only works for N = 1, but that it at least also produces some families of
N -affine Lie algebras.
    For the example related to (5.1) we take as ġ the Lie algebra of type Dℓ+2m . We again
realize this Lie algebra as the complex space of anti-symmetric (2ℓ + 2m+1 ) × (2ℓ + 2m+1 )-

then we define Σ = (σ0 , σ1 , . . . σn ) by
                                       (
                                         Ad(Jk )          for 0 ≤ k ≤ m,
                              σk =
                                         id               for k > m.

Then ġ(0,0,... ,0) is the simple Lie algebra of type Bℓ and all the 2m+1 − 1 other spaces
ġ(i0 ,i1 ...im ,0,... ,0) consist of the direct sum of the 2ℓ+1-dimensional irreducible representation
together with 2m − 1 trivial 1-dimensional ones. Clearly the Lie algebra g(Σ) corresponds
to the root system for Xℓ = Bℓ which is given in (5.1).
      For the second example, the one related to (5.2), we take as ġ the simple Lie algebra
of type A2ℓ+2m+1 −1 , which can be realized in the usual way as complex traceless 2ℓ +
2m+1 × 2ℓ + 2m+1 -matrices. For σ0 we again take as §4.9 the Cartan involution, i.e.,
σ0 (X) = −X T . All the other automorphisms are defined as follows:
                                           (
                                             Ad(Jk−1 )      for 1 ≤ k ≤ m + 1,
                                     σk =
                                             id             for k > m + 1.

The algebra ġ(0,0,... ,0) is the simple Lie algebra of type Bℓ . The space ġ(1,0,... ,0) consists
of the direct sum of a 2ℓ2 + 3ℓ-dimensional irreducible representation of Bℓ together with
2m − 1 1-dimensional trivial representations. All other 2m+2 − 2 spaces ġ(i0 ,i1 ,... ,im+1 ,0,... ,0)
cosist of the direct sum of the 2ℓ + 1 irreducible representation of Bℓ and 2m − 1 trivial 1-
dimensional representations. This leads to a Lie algebra g(Σ), whose root system restricted
to V is given by (5.2).
