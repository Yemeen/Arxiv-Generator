                                                                               Introduction
                                                For real semisimple Lie groups G and their Lie algebras g interesting features of
                                             convexity have been discovered. This paper makes a contribution which is related to
                                             certain G-orbits in the complexification XC = GC /KC of a Riemannian symmetric
                                             space X = G/K of the non-compact type. Applications to analytically continued
                                             spherical functions will be given.
                                                Our results borrow in spirit and techniques from the well understood situation
                                             on the real space X. Therefore it is useful to review some of these results and
                                             methods. Let g and k denote the Lie algebras of G and K. Then there is a Cartan
                                             decomposition g = k+ p. We fix a maximal abelian subspace a ⊆ p. Then Kostant’s
                                             linear convexity theorem [5] reads

                                             (1)                 (∀Y ∈ a)       pr(Ad(K)Y ) = conv(WY ) .

                                             In this formula pr: p → a is the orthogonal projection, W = ZK (a)\NK (a) is the
                                             Weyl group and conv(·) denotes the convex hull of (·).
                                                There is a related version of (1) on the Riemannian symmetric space X = G/K.
                                             For that let G = N AK be an Iwasawa decomposition of G and a: G → A the
                                             corresponding middle projection. Then Kostant’s non-linear convexity theorem [5]
                                             says

                                             (2)                (∀Y ∈ a)      log a(K exp(Y )) = conv(WY ) .

                                                Let us mention that for all applications of (1) and (2) to harmonic analysis one
                                             only needs the inclusion ′′ ⊆′′ . For this part (1) and (2) can easily seen to be
                                             equivalent: Let λ ∈ a∗ and Y ∈ a be both regular. Then with M = ZK (a) the
                                             linear/non-linear phase functions on M \K are defined by

                                                                  fλ,Y : M \K → R, M k 7→ λ(pr(Ad(k)Y ))
                                                                  Fλ,Y : M \K → R, M k 7→ a(k exp(Y ))λ .
                                             Standard arguments show that fλ,Y and Fλ,Y have the same critical set which is
                                             computed to be W (cf. [12]). From that one easily derives both inclusions “ ⊆′′ in
                                             (1) and (2).
                                                The phase function Fλ,Y (as well as fλ,Y ) is Morse. This means that the method
                                             of stationary phase applies for computing the asypmtotics of the oscillatory integral

                                               The work was supported in part by NSF-grant DMS-0097314

associated to Fλ,Y (cf. [12]). Up to a spectral shift by ρ ∈ a∗ this oscillatory integral
is the spherical function ϕλ on X = G/K
                         Z
               ϕλ (a) =         Fρ−iλ,Y (M k) dM k       (a = exp(Y )) .
                             M\K

The conclusion is that convexity associated to the Riemannian symmetric space
X = G/K is intimately related to the asymptotics of spherical functions in the
spectral parameter λ. It is important for us that this dictionary remains true once
we analytically continue from X to certain domains in XC (although the method
of stationary phase does not apply anymore). We will comment more on this later.
    There is another convexity result for X which is related to the polar decompo-
sition X = KA+ K/K:

(3)   (∀Y1 , Y2 ∈ a+ )       exp(Y1 )K exp(Y2 ) ⊆ K exp (conv (W(Y1 + Y2 ))) K

(cf. [11])
   The main result of this paper is a certain complex version of (3). Let us be more
specific. Denote by Σ the root system of g w.r.t. a and define a bounded convex
domain in a by
                                                         π
                        Ω = {Y ∈ a: (∀α ∈ Σ) |α(Y )| < }·
                                                         2
If xo denotes the base point in XC , then we shall be interested in those G-orbits in
XC which pass through exp(iΩ).xo . The union of those orbits gives us the complex
crown of the Riemannian symmetric space X:

                                Ξ = G exp(iΩ).xo ⊆ XC .

The complex crown is a G-invariant Stein neighborhood of X in XC which was
subject of many recent investigations.
   Finally we set XC,s = KC AC .xo and notice that XC,s is set of all points in XC
with closed KC -orbits. This set is large in the sense that it contains an open and
dense subset of XC (regular semisimple elements). The appropriate holomorphic
extension of (3) now is (cf. Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 below):
Theorem 1. Let Y ∈ Ω. Then
                         \
            G exp(iY ).xo XC,s ⊆ KC A exp(i conv(WY )).xo .
                   T
In particular, Ξ       XC,s ⊆ KC A exp(iΩ).xo .                                        

   For the Lorentzian groups G = SOe (1, n) this convexity inclusion was proved in
[7] by explicit computation. In the classical cases of G = Sl(n, K), i.e. when X has
a canonical realization in symmetric matrices, it might be interesting to observe
that Theorem 1 is not obvious from elementary linear algebra (see Section 3 for a
detailed discussion).
   We describe briefly the method of the proof. It was observed in [8] that spherical
functions ϕλ on X admit a holomorphic continuation ϕ     eλ to Ξ. Equally spherical
functions extend to KC -invariant holomorphic functions on KC A exp(2iΩ).xo (cf.
[8]). For fixed generic elements a ∈ A exp(iΩ) we give near optimal estimates for

ϕ
eλ (a) for large spectral parameters λ. The upper estimate hereby is obtained from
the complex version of the non-linear convexity theorem [2]. For the lower estimate
we use Harish-Chandra’s power series expansion for spherical functions. From these
estimates one then derives the convexity inclusion of Theorem 1.
   The above convexity theorem features various applications to harmonic analysis.
In summary we show (cf. Theorem 2.3.1 and Theorem 2.3.2 below):
Theorem 2. The following assertions hold:
  1. Let ϕλ be a positive definite spherical function on X. Then its holomorphic
     extension ϕeλ to Ξ is bounded.
  2. Let ρt be the heat kernel on X and ρet its holomorphic continuation to Ξ (cf.
     [9]). Then ρet is bounded.
                                                                                

        1. Basic facts on KC -double cosets and complex crowns
   This section is organized as follows. We begin with introducing the standard
notation neded for the discussion of Riemannian symmetric spaces X = G/K and
their complexifications XC = GC /KC . Then we summarize the basic facts of the KC
-action on the affine variety XC . Finally we provide the reader with the definition
and main features of the complex crown Ξ ⊆ XC of a Riemannian symmetric space
X.
1.1. Notation. Let us denote by g a real semisimple Lie algebra with Cartan
decomposition g = k + p. We fix a maximal abelian subspace a ⊆ p and set
m = zk (a). Then one has the root space decomposition
                                               M
                                g=a⊕m⊕               gα
                                               α∈Σ


with Σ ⊆ a∗ the corresponding restricted root L      system. Select a positive system
Σ+ ⊆ Σ and form the nilpotent subalgebra n = α∈Σ+ gα .
   If l is a Lie algebra, then we write lC for its complexification.
   On the group level we let GC be a simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra gC .
Write A, AC , G, K, KC , N and NC for the analytic subgroups of GC with Lie algebra
a, aC , g, k, kC , n and nC . The Weyl group of Σ is given by W = NK (a)/ZK (a).
   For every α ∈ Σ we define a character ξα of AC by

                              ξα (a) = aα : = eα(log a) .

Regular and singular elements in AC are defined by

       AC,reg = {a ∈ AC : (∀α ∈ Σ) ξα2 (a) 6= 1} and AC,sing = AC \AC,reg .

1.2. Algebraic aspects and categorical quotients. Write X = G/K for the
Riemannian symmetric space associated with G and K. We denote by XC =
GC /KC the complexification of X. Notice that XC is an affine KC -variety. As we
4                                 BERNHARD KRÖTZ


are interested in the KC -action on XC an algebraic view point is useful for our
geometric studies.
   The results collected below are not new, but sometimes we include short proofs
for readability. We first recall the basic facts concerning affine varieties with reduc-
tive group action.
   Let H be a complex reductive group and V be an affine H-variety. Define
semisimple and regular elements in V by

                             Vs = {v ∈ V : Hv is closed}
and
                         Vr = {v ∈ V : dim Hv is maximal} .
Further we set Vrs = Vr ∩ Vs .
   Denote by C[V ] the algebra of regular (polynomial) functions on V and write
C[V ]H for the H-invariants in C[V ]. According to Hilbert, C[V ]H is finitely gen-
erated and so corresponds to an affine variety V //H, the categorical quotient of V
by H. Let us denote by
                                 P : V → V //H
the map corresponding to the inclusion C[V ]H ֒→ C[V ]. Recall from [6, II.3.2-3]
the following properties of P .
Lemma 1.2.1. The quotient map P : V → V //H has the following properties:
  1. Every fiber of P contains a unique closed orbit. In particular P is onto.
  2. (∀v ∈ Vs ) P −1 (P (v)) = {w ∈ V : v ∈ Hw}.
  3. (∀v ∈ Vrs ) P −1 (P (v)) = Hv.
                                                                                      
  Let us now switch to our special situation of V = XC and H = KC . We denote
by xo = KC the base point in XC . Then, as a special case of general results of
Matsuki [10], we obtain that:
Lemma 1.2.2. The following assertions hold:
  1. XC,s = KC AC .xo .
  2. XC,rs = KC AC,reg .xo .
                                                                                      
   We continue with a discussion of the set XC,rs . Define a finite 2-group by F =
AC ∩ KC . Notice that W normalizes F and that both sets AC,reg and AC,sing are
invariant under multiplication by F . Write MC = ZKC (A). We define a right action
of W on KC /MC × AC,reg /F by (kMC , aF ).w = (kwMC , w−1 awF ). The resulting
quotient will be denoted by KC /MC ×W AC,reg /F . Then it was essentially shown
in [6, Lemma 2.1] that:
Proposition 1.2.3. The set XC,rs is open and dense in XC . Moreover, the map-
ping
           Φ: KC /MC ×W AC,reg /F → XC,rs , [kMC , aF ] 7→ ka.xo
is a KC -equivariant biholomorphism.                                                  

   In the remainder of this subsection we discuss more specifically the structure of
the quotient mapping P : XC → XC //KC .
          CONVEXITY IN COMPLEXIFIED RIEMANNIAN SYMMETRIC SPACES                       5


   Recall that the algebra C[XC ]KC of invariants is free in n = dimR a generators,
say
                    C[XC ]KC = C[p1 , . . . , pn ] ≃ C[x1 , . . . , xn ] .
Thus XC //KC = Cn and the projection mapping is given by

                      P : XC → Cn , z 7→ (p1 (z), . . . , pn (z)) .
   Notice that AC /F → AC .xo , aF 7→ a.xo is a biholomorphism . We denote by
PA : AC .xo → Cn the restriction of the projection P to AC .xo . We summarize some
(known) facts of the map PA :
Proposition 1.2.4. The restriction PA : AC .xo → Cn of P to AC .xo has the fol-
lowing properties:
   1. The map PA is holomorphic onto open finite and proper.
   2. For every z ∈ AC .xo the fiber of PA over PA (z) = P (z) is W.z.
   3. The restriction of PA to the regular elements

                       PA |AC,reg .xo : AC,reg .xo → P (AC,reg .xo )

      is a covering map.
Proof. As P is a polynomial map, its restriction PA is holomorphic. Next PA is
onto because of Lemma 1.2.1(1) and Lemma 1.2.2(1). We do not show that PA is
proper but remark that it is a known fact which can be deduced from the fact that
the polynomials p1 , . . . , pn are the elementary spherical functions. Standard finite
dimensional representation theory then gives the properness of PA .
   By standard structure theory we have for z, z ′ ∈ AC .xo that

                  KC z = KC z ′        ⇐⇒       (∃w ∈ W) w.z = z ′ .

Thus Lemma 1.2.1(1) and Lemma 1.2.2(1) give us that PA is finite as well as the
second assertion 2. in the proposition.
   That PA is open now follows from the properness and 2. This completes the
proof of 1.
   Finally, the third assertion 3. follows from 1. and 2.                    
   If M is a complex manifold, then we write O(M ) for the space of holomorphic
functions on M . If in addition a group L acts on M , then we denote by O(M )L the
subspace of O(M ) which consists of L-invariant functions. Then we obtain from
Proposition 1.2.4 the following (known) corollary:
Corollary 1.2.5. Let M ⊆ XC be a connected open KC -invariant subset. Then
MA = M ∩ AC .xo is open and W-invariant in AC .xo and the restriction mapping

                      Res: O(M )KC → O(MA )W , f 7→ f |MA

is an isomorphism.
Proof. Let us first show that Res is injective. Let f ∈ O(M )KC such that f |MA = 0.
The KC -invariance of f implies that f vanishes on KC MA = M ∩XC,s . As XC,s ∩M
is dense in M by Proposition 1.2.3, it follows that f ≡ 0. Hence Res is injective.
6                                  BERNHARD KRÖTZ


  To show that Res is onto, let F ∈ O(MA ). We have to show that there exists an
f ∈ O(M )KC such that f |MA = F . Let us define a function on M by

                       (∀z ∈ M )       f (z) = F (PA−1 (P (z))) .

This map f is well defined as every fiber of PA is a W-orbit (cf. Proposition
1.2.4(2)) and F is invariant under W. The properness of PA gives us that f is
continuous. It is also clear that f |MA = F and that F is KC -invariant. It remains
to see that f is holomorphic. From Proposition 1.2.4(3) we deduce that f is holo-
morphic on XC,rs ∩ M . As f is also continuous, the Riemann removable singularity
theorem applies and yields the holomorphicity of f .                             
1.3. Complex crowns. Define a W-invariant, convex and relatively compact
subset of a by
                                                      π
                        Ω = {Y ∈ a: (∀α ∈ Σ) |α(Y )| < } .
                                                      2
Following [1] we define the complex crown Ξ of X by

                             Ξ = G exp(iΩ).xo ⊆ XC .
It was shown in [1] that Ξ is an open G-invariant neighborhood of X with proper
G-action. Notice that Ξ is independent of the choice of a hence canonically attached
to X. Recently it was shown by many authors that Ξ is actually Stein.
   For a subset ω ⊆ 2Ω we define the set

                                   T (ω) = A exp(iω)

and notice that Tω is homeomorphic to a + iω via the exponential mapping exp |
aC : a C→
        → AC . Moreover, as T (2Ω) ∩ F = {1} it follows that the mapping T (2Ω) →
XC , a 7→ a.xo is an injection.
  Another important feature of the crown is that


(1.3.2)                            Ξ ⊆ NC T (Ω).xo

(cf. [2]). In particular we have a well defined holomorphic mapping

                a: Ξ → T (Ω), nu.xo 7→ u         (n ∈ NC , u ∈ T (Ω)) .

Further we have the complex convexity theorem [2] which states that

(1.3.3)        (∀Y ∈ Ω)       Im log a(G exp(iY ).xo ) ⊆ conv(WY ) .

Here conv(·) denotes the convex hull of (·).
   Set a+ = {Y ∈ a: (∀α ∈ Σ+ ) α(Y ) > 0} and A+ = exp(a+ ). Later we will need
also the following subsets of Ω:

                        Ω+ = Ω ∩ a +      and Ω′ = WΩ+ .
  It is useful to introduce some further terminology and define for very W-invariant
convex subset ω ⊆ 2Ω the KC -invariant set

                                XC,ω = KC T (ω).xo

in XC . Notice that even for ω open the set XC,ω is not open in XC . To overcome
this difficulty we define

                             bC,ω = P −1 (P (T (ω).xo )) .
                             X

                                                 bC,ω is a KC -invariant subset of
 From the definition it follows immediately that X
XC containing XC,ω . Moreover it follows from Proposition 1.2.4(1) that X  bC,ω is
open if ω is open.

                           2. The convexity theorem
  For Y ∈ a let us denote by co(Y ) the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit WY .
We start with stating the main result.
Theorem 2.1. Let Y ∈ Ω. Then
                                 \
(2.1)            G exp(iY ).xo       XC,s ⊆ XC,co(Y ) = KC T (co(Y )).xo .

In particular,

(2.2)                                            bC,co(Y ) .
                                 G exp(iY ).xo ⊆ X


  Before we start proving Theorem 2.1 let us mention an interesting consequence:

       T 2.2. The following inclusions hold:
Corollary
  1. Ξ XC,s ⊆ XC,Ω .
  2. Ξ ⊆ XbC,Ω .
                                                                                       
   It seems to us that giving a direct geometric proof of Theorem 2.1 is rather
difficult. Instead we will proceed indirectly. We will use spherical functions on X.
These functions have an analytic continuation to a holomorphic function on Ξ as
well as to a XbC,2Ω (cf. [8]). Below we will give pointwise estimates of the analytically
extended spherical functions which are uniform in the spectral parameter. From
that we will deduce Theorem 2.1.
2.1. Spherical functions. We begin with recalling Harish-Chandra’s integral
representation    of spherical functions. For α ∈ Σ we set mα = dim gα and define
     1P
ρ = 2 α∈Σ+ mα α ∈ a∗ .
   If λ ∈ a∗C , then one defines the spherical function on X with parameter λ to be
the K-invariant eigenfunction
                                   Z
                        ϕλ (gK) =      a(kg)ρ−λ dk     (g ∈ G) .
                                      K

Here dk is the normalized Haar measure on the compact group K. It follows from
(1.3.2) that ϕλ has a holomorphic extension to Ξ which we will denote by ϕ
                                                                         eλ (cf.
[8]).
   On the other hand ϕλ | A extends to a W-invariant holomorphic function on
                                                bC,2Ω implies:
T (2Ω) [8]. Thus Corollary 1.2.5 applied to M = X

Proposition 2.1.1. Let λ ∈ a∗C . Then ϕλ uniquely extends to a KC -invariant
                        bC,2Ω .
holomorphic function on X                                                 
  We shall prove point-wise estimates for analytically continued spherical functions
which are uniform in the spectral paramter. The upper bound is easy to obtain:
Lemma 2.1.2. Let Q ⊆ Ξ be a compact subset. Then there exists a constant C > 0
such that for all g exp(iY ).xo ∈ Q with g ∈ G, Y ∈ Ω one has
                 (∀λ ∈ ia∗ )         eλ (g exp(iY ).xo )| ≤ C · supw∈W eiλ(wY ) .
                                    |ϕ

Proof. Fix g exp(iY ).xo ∈ Q and recall the definition
                                         Z
                  ϕeλ (g exp(iY ).xo ) =   a(kg exp(iY ))ρ−λ dk .
                                                        K
Thus (1.3.3) implies that
                                    Z

with                                               Z
                               C = supz∈Q               |a(kz)ρ | dk < ∞ .
                                                   K
                                                                                            
   Now we switch to the lower estimates. For that we will use Harish-Chandra’s
power series expansion of spherical function (cf. [4]).
   We briefly recall the standard notation. Define a semigroup Λ = N0 [Σ+ ] ⊆ a∗ .
As usual we denote by c(λ) the Harish-Chandra c-function. This is a meromor-
phic function on a∗C with no poles on the imaginary axis ia∗ ; it can be explicitely
computed (Gindikin-Karpelevic formula, see [4, Ch. IV, Th. 6.14]).
   For σ ∈ a∗C and a ∈ T (Ω) we write aσ = eσ(log a) .
   Fix λ ∈ ia∗ . Then for a ∈ A+ Harish Chandra’s expansion of ϕλ is given as
follows (cf. [4, Ch. IV, Th. 5.5]):
                                  X
(2.1.1)                 ϕλ (a) =    c(wλ) · awλ−ρ · Ψwλ (a) ,
                                            w∈W

where                                                  X
                                    Ψwλ (a) =                Γµ (wλ)a−µ .
                                                       µ∈Λ
                 ∗
    For σ ∈ ia the coefficients Γµ (σ) are defined recursively by Γ0 (σ) = 1 and

                            2         X     X
(2.1.2) Γµ (σ) =                         mα   Γµ−2kα (σ)(hµ+ρ−2kα, αi+hα, σi) .
                     hµ, µi + 2hµ, σi  +     α∈Σ            k≥1

   The power series Ψwλ are locally abolutely convergent on A+ . One can deduce
this from the following fact ([4, Ch. IV, Lemma 5.6]): for all H ∈ a+ there is a
constant CH > 0 such that


(2.1.3)                (∀µ ∈ Λ)(∀λ ∈ ia∗ )                   |Γµ (λ)| ≤ CH · eµ(H) .
It is clear that (2.1.1) is also valid for all a ∈ A+ exp(iΩ).
          CONVEXITY IN COMPLEXIFIED RIEMANNIAN SYMMETRIC SPACES                              9


Lemma 2.1.3. Fix λ0 ∈ ia∗ . Then the following assertions hold:
  1. For all µ ∈ Λ the limit

                                    Γµ [λ0 ]: = lim Γµ (tλ0 )
                                               t→∞

     exists.
  2. The power series
                                X
                 Ψ[λ0 ] (a) =         Γµ ([λ0 ])a−µ        (a ∈ A+ exp(iΩ))
                                µ∈Λ


      is locally absolutely convergent on A+ exp(iΩ). In particular, Ψ[λ0 ] defines a
      non-zero holomorphic function on A+ exp(iΩ). Moreover

                                          Ψtλ0 → Ψ[λ0 ]

      locally uniformly on A+ exp(iΩ) for t → ∞.
Proof. 1. Let α1 , . . . , αn be a basis of Σ+ . If µ = m1 α1 + . . . + mn αn ∈ Λ, then
define its degree by deg µ = m1 + . . . + mn . We use the recurrence relation (2.1.3)
and induction on deg µ to deduce that for every µ ∈ Λ the function

                                 Fµ : R → C, t 7→ Γµ (tλ0 )

is rational with no poles. Moreover (2.1.3) implies that Fµ is bounded. Thus if
       p
Fµ = qµµ with polynomials pµ and qµ we obtain that deg pµ ≤ deg qµ . From that
the assertion follows.
2. This follows from 1. and the estimate (2.1.3).                            
  Let us call an element λ ∈ a∗C regular if hλ, αi =
                                                   6 0 for all α ∈ Σ.
Proposition 2.1.4. Fix λ0 ∈ ia∗ regular. Let H ∈ a+ and Y ∈ Ω′ and set
a = exp(H + iY ). Then there exists a constant Ca,λ0 ≥ 0 such that for all t >> 0
one has
                                   Ca,λ
                    etλ0 (a.xo )| ≥ p 0 · supw∈W eitλ0 (wY ) ,
                   |ϕ
                                     t
where p = 12 dim N . Moreover Ca,λ0 > 0 for all elements a in a dense open subset
of A+ exp(iΩ′ ).
Proof. A basic result of Harish-Chandra asserts that ϕλ = ϕwλ for all λ ∈ a∗C and
w ∈ W. Thus by the regularity of λ0 and Y we may assume that λ0 (iY ) > λ0 (iwY )
for all w ∈ W, w 6= 1. Therefore it suffices to show that

                                                           Ca,λ0 itλ0 (Y )
(2.1.4)             (∀t >> 0)            etλ0 (a.xo )| ≥
                                        |ϕ                      ·e
                                                            tp
for a constant Ca,λ0 ≥ 0 which is actually positive for a ranging in a dense open
subset of A+ exp(iΩ′ ).
   From (2.1.1) we obtain that:
                                      X
(2.1.5)       etλ0 (a.xo ) = aρ ·
              ϕ                           c(twλ0 ) · eitλ0 (wY ) · etλ0 (wH) · Ψtwλ0 (a) .
                                    w∈W
10                                BERNHARD KRÖTZ


Contemplating on (2.1.5) we notice the following facts:
• |etλ0 (wH) | = 1 for all t ∈ R and w ∈ W as λ0 is imaginary.
• |aρ | > 0 is independent of λ.
• | c(twλ0 )| = | c(tλ0 )| for all w ∈ W (Maaß-Selberg relations, cf. [4, p. 451, (16)]).
• There is a constant C > 0 such that | c(tλ0 )| ≥ tCp for t >> 0 (cf. [4, Ch. IV,
  Prop. 7.2]).
• Ψtwλ0 (a) is uniformly bounded in t for all w ∈ W by Lemma 2.1.2 (2).
  Combining these facts with (2.1.5) we obtain (2.1.4) for some Ca,λ0 ≥ 0. To be
more precise we have Ca,λ0 > 0 provided that Ψ[λ0 ] (a) 6= 0 (cf. Lemma 2.1.3(2)),
and this finishes the proof.                                                    
2.2. Proof of Theorem 2.1. During the proof we will frequently use the fact
that the mapping

(2.2.1)              G/M × Ω+ → Ξ, (gM, Y ) 7→ g exp(iY ).xo

is a diffeomorphism with open and dense image (cf. [9, Cor. 4.2]).
   Due to the statement of the theorem we may assume that Y ∈ Ω+ . We now
proceed by contradiction. If the statement were false, there would exist a g ∈ G such
that g exp(iY ).xo ∈ XC,s but g exp(iY ).xo 6∈ KC T (co(Y )).xo . Let g(t), t ∈ [0, 1],
be a continuous path in G such that g(0) = 1 and g(1) = g. Recall the quotient
mapping P : XC → Cn from Subsection 1.2. Define a continuous path in Cn by
γ(t) = P (g(t) exp(iY ).xo ). Then γ(0) = P (exp(iY ).xo ) ∈ P (T (co(Y )).xo ). As
PA = P |AC .xo is proper (cf. Proposition 1.2.4(1)), we conclude that P (T (co(Y )).xo )
is closed. Thus there exists a 0 ≤ t0 < 1 which is maximal with respect to the
property that γ(t) ∈ P (T (co(Y )).xo ) for all 0 ≤ t ≤ t0 . Again it follows from
Proposition 1.2.4(1) that P (T (Ω).xo ) is an open neighborhood of γ(t0 ). Thus we
find a t0 < t1 ≤ 1 such that γ(t) ∈ P (T (Ω).xo ) for all 0 ≤ t ≤ t1 . Now pick
t0 < t2 ≤ t1 such that γ(t2 ) = P (a.xo ) for some a ∈ T (Ω)\T (co(Y )). It is no loss
of generality to assume now that g = g(t2 ) and reparametrizing g(t) we may also
assume that t2 = 1.
   To sum up, if the statement were false we find a g ∈ G and a continuous path
g(t), t ∈ [0, 1], in G with g(0) = 1 and g(1) = g such that g(t) exp(iY ).xo ∈ X   bC,Ω
for all t ∈ [0, 1] and P (g exp(iY ).xo ) = P (a.xo ) for some a ∈ T (Ω)\T (co(Y )). In
particular, it follows from Proposition 2.1.1 that


(2.2.2)             (∀λ ∈ a∗C )    ϕ
                                   eλ (g exp(iY ).xo ) = ϕ
                                                         eλ (a.xo ) .

   Using (2.2.1) we can vary g and Y slighty to obtain a ∈ A+ exp(iΩ′ ), say a =
exp(H + iZ) for some H ∈ a+ and Z ∈ Ω′ .
   As Z ∈ Ω\ co(Y ), we can use the theorem of Hahn-Banach to find a λ0 ∈ ia∗
regular such that |λ0 (Z)| > |λ0 (wY )| for all w ∈ W.
   Lemma 2.1.2 implies

(2.2.3)       (∀t > 0)      etλ0 (g exp(iY ).xo )| ≤ C · supw∈W etiλ0 (wY )
                           |ϕ

for a constant C > 0.

   On the other hand (2.2.2) combined with Proposition 2.1.4 gives us for all t >> 0
that


                                                                 C′

                                                                 tp
for a constant C ′ ≥ 0. Moreover varying g and Y slightly if necessary we may
assume that C ′ > 0 (cf. Proposition 2.1.4). Then (2.2.4) clearly contradicts (2.2.3),
concluding the proof of the theorem.                                                
2.3. Applications. Define a subset of a∗C by

                        Π = {λ ∈ a∗C : ϕλ is positive definite} .

Recall that ia∗ ⊆ Π and that for all λ ∈ Π the spherical function ϕλ is bounded on
X.
   Using Theorem 2.1 and the same reasoning as in [7] we now obtain that:
Theorem 2.3.1. Let λ ∈ Π. Then the analytically continued spherical function
ϕ
eλ is bounded on Ξ.                                                        
Proof. For λ ∈ Π it was established in [8] that ϕ
                                                eλ is bounded on XC,Ω . Now the
assertion follows from Corollary 2.2.                                        
   Another application of Theorem 2.1 is related to the heat kernel which was
suggested to us by M. Stenzel. In the sequel t > 0 denotes a positive number. We
denote by ρt (x), x ∈ X, the heat kernel on X.
   Using the spectral resolution of ρt it was shown in [9] that ρt has an analytic
continuation to a holomorphic function on Ξ which we will denote by ρet . Then it
follows readily from Theorem 2.1, Lemma 2.1.2 and the spectral resolution of ρt
that:
Theorem 2.3.2. Fix t > 0 and let ρt be the heat kernel on X. Then the analytically
continued heat kernel ρet is bounded on Ξ.                                      

                       3. Examples: Symmetric matrices
   In this section we will illustrate Theorem 2.1 for the choices of G = Sl(n, R)
and G = Sl(n, C). Then X = G/K has a canonical realization in real/complex
symmetric matrices. It might be interesting to observe that even in these classical
cases Theorem 2.1 seems to be new and likely forfeits a proof using only techniques
from elementary linear algebra.
3.1. Real symmetric matrices. Let now G = Sl(n, R) and K = SO(n). Then
GC = Sl(n, C) and KC = SO(n, C). The mapping gKC 7→ gg t identifies XC with
the complex symmetric matrices of determinant one

                      XC = {Z ∈ M (n, C): Z = Z t , det Z = 1} .

Within this identification X is the set of all real positive definite symmetric matrices
of determinant one

                 X = {Y ∈ M (n, R): Y = Y t , Y >> 0, det Y = 1} .

   We choose A to be the positive diagonal matrices in G = Sl(n, R). Then W
becomes the symmetric group Sn in n letters permuting the diagonal entries. The
set Ω is given by

Accordingly we have
                                                                                                
                                                                                            ai
      T (Ω) = {a = diag(a1 , . . . , an ) ∈ Sl(n, C): (∀1 ≤ i, j ≤ n)              Re                > 0} .
                                                                                            aj
Let us write DR for the diagonal matrices in X and DC for the diagonal matrices
in XC . Notice that the mapping AC → DC , a 7→ a.xo = a2 is the square mapping.
If D(Ω) denotes the isomorphic image of T (Ω) in XC , then we have
                                                                   ai
         D(Ω) = {a = diag(a1 , . . . , an ) ∈ XC : (∀1 ≤ i, j ≤ n)    ∈ C+ } ,
                                                                   aj
where C+ = C\] − ∞, 0].
  Notice that                                     [
                                             Ξ=         gD(Ω)g t .

     Now Theorem 2.1 in this special situation reads as follows:
Proposition 3.1.1. Let Y = diag(y1 , . . . , yn ) be a real diagonal matrix with zero
trace and |yi − yj | < π for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Then
                        co(Y ) = conv{diag(yσ(1) , . . . , yσ(n) ): σ ∈ Sn }
and
                                                           
             [                    \          [                           [
                    geiY g t                       kDC k −1  ⊆               kDR ei co(Y ) k −1 .
         g∈Sl(n,R)                        k∈SO(n,C)                  k∈SO(n,C)

                                                                                                              
3.2. Complex symmetric matrices. Let us now consider the case of G =
Sl(n, C) and K = SU(n). Then we have canonical biholomorphisms KC ≃ G and
XC ≃ G. Within this identifications the actions of G and KC on XC are given by

                                  G × XC → XC , (g, z) 7→ gzg ∗ ,
                                  KC × XC → XC , (k, z) 7→ kzk −1
(cf. [3, Sect. 3]). As before we choose A < G to be the group of diagonal matrices
with positive entries and write D(Ω) for the faithful image of T (Ω) in XC = G.
Then
                                                                                    ai
            D(Ω) = {a = diag(a1 , . . . , an ) ∈ XC : (∀1 ≤ i, j ≤ n)                  ∈ C+ }.
                                                                                    aj
In particular we obtain
                                                  [
                                          Ξ=               gD(Ω)g ∗ .
                                               g∈Sl(n,C)

     With the notation introduced above Theorem 2.1 now reads as follows:
