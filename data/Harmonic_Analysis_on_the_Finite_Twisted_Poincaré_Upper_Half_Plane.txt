                                                   Abstract. We prove that the induced representation from a non trivial character
                                                   of the Coxeter torus of GL(2, F), for a finite field F , is multiplicity-free; we give an
                                                   explicit description of the corresponding (twisted) spherical functions and a version
                                                   of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.




                                                                                   1. Introduction
                                               Let F be a finite field, with q elements, and E be its unique quadratic extension.
                                            Put G = GL(2, F) and denote by K the Coxeter torus of G, realized as the subgroup
                                            of all matrices mz (z ∈ E × ) of the maps w 7→ zw(w ∈ E) with respect to a fixed
                                            F - basis of E. Recall that the finite homogeneous space H = G/K may be looked
                                            upon as the finite analogue of (the double cover of) the classical Poincaré Upper
                                            Half Plane (see [4]). Harmonic analysis on H amounts to decompose the induced
                                            representation IndGK 1 from the unit character 1 of K to G. We are interested here
                                            in the “twisted” version of this, i.e., the decomposition of the induced representation
                                            IndGK Φ from a non (necessarily) trivial character Φ of K to G. The real analogue of
                                            this case has been considered in [1]. We prove that this representation is multiplicity-
                                            free, taking advantage of the fact that this is so for IndG
                                                                                                      K 1 (see [4]) and reducing the
                                            computation of the multiplicities in IndK Φ to the ones in IndG
                                                                                        G
                                                                                                               K 1. We also give an
                                            explicit description of the corresponding (twisted) spherical functions. Finally, we
                                            give a version of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

                                                                                                    K Φ.

                                            2.1. The case Φ = 1. We consider first the special case Φ = 1 in which the multi-
                                            plicity one theorem follows from a geometric argument. In fact, we have
                                                                                  IndG       2

L2 (H), defined by (τg f )(z) = f (g −1.z), where z 7→ g.z is the homographic action of
G on H, given by
                    az + b                              a b
                                                            
              g.z =                           forg =           ∈ G, z ∈ H.
                    cz + d                              c d
Definition 1. For all z, w ∈ H, we put
                                         N(z − w)
                                  D(z, w) =
                                         N(z − w̄)
with the convention that D(z, w) = ∞ if w = z̄.

Proposition 1. D is an orbit classifying invariant function for the homographic
action of G in H × H.

Corollary 1. The commuting algebra of (L2 (H), τ ) is commutative.
  This follows from the fact that, the classifying invariant D being symmetric, the
G-orbits in H × H are also symmetric.                                            ✷
2.2. The case of general Φ. Let’s denote by φ the restriction of Φ to F × . We will
prove that every twisting of an irreducible representation πθd of G (where the super-
script d denotes the dimension of π and θ its character parameter) by the character
                                                           ′      ′′
(Φ + Φq ) is isomorphic to a representation of the form πθd′ + πθd′′ , when restricted to
K. In fact we will work with the characters χdθ of the irreducible representations πθd
of G, for which we keep the notations of [5] or [2].
Lemma 1. On K we have
                  q−1          q+1
(Φ + Φq )χqα,α = χΦ(α◦N ) + χφα,α ,
(Φ + Φq )χ1α,α = χq+1      q−1
                  φα,α − χΦ(α◦N ) ,
(Φ + Φq )χq+1     q+1       q+1
           α,β = χφα,β + χα,φβ ,
(Φ + Φq )χΛq−1 = χΦΛ
                  q−1
                      + χΦ q−1
                             q Λ.                                                       ✷
  Now for a character χ of G, we have χ ◦ Frob = χ on K, as it follows from
the character table. Therefore K Φ̄(k q )χ(k) = K Φ̄(k)χ(k) because Frob is an
                                  P                 P

involutive automorphism.
  Hence, the multiplicity of π in IndG           1 P
                                      K Φ equals 2

                                                     K (Φ̄ + Φ̄ )(k)π(k) and so it is just
the average of the multiplicities in IndG
                                        K 1 of two representations of G (one of which
may be virtual!)

Remark 1. Put πα,α q+1
                       = παq + πα1 and πα◦N  = παq − πα1 for every α ∈ (F × )∧ . It is
                                                              q+1
easy to check than in the degenerate cases α = β (for π = πα,β    ) and Λ = Λq (for
      q−1
π = πΛ ) we find for the multiplicities m1 (π)
                        q+1
                   m1 (πα,α )=1                          (α ∈ (F × )∧ )               (1)

and
                      q−1
                 m1 (πα◦N ) = −δα,1                           (α ∈ (F × )∧ )       (2)
  Using the fact that the multiplicities of the irreducible representations of G in
IndG
   K 1 are at most one and also equations (1) and (2), we get that the multiplicities
are also at most one in the more general case of IndG
                                                    K Φ.                           ✷

3.1. The averaging construction. In this section G denotes an arbitrary finite
group, K a subgroup of Gand Φ a one dimensional representation of K. We notice
that the spherical functions for the representation IndG
                                                       K Φ are obtained as weighted
averages of the characters of G. More precisely:
Definition 2. Let L1 (G) be the group algebra of G, realized as the convolution algebra
of all complex functions of G and let L1Φ (G, K) be the convolution algebra of all
complex functions f on G such that
                              f (kgk ′) = Φ(k)f (g)Φ(k ′ )
for all g ∈ G, k, k ′ ∈ K. For any f ∈ L1 (G) put
                                          1 X −1
                          (PΦ f )(g) =           Φ (k)f (kg)

for all g ∈ G.

  Notice that the operator PΦ is just convolution with the idempotent function εΦK ∈
 1                            −1                                             1
L G which coincides with |K| Φ on K and vanishes elsewhere. Moreover LΦ (G, K)
may be writen as εΦ    1     Φ
                  K ∗ L G ∗ εK and its elements f are characterized by the properties

                                  K ∗ f = f = f ∗ εK


Lemma 2. Let χ be the character of an irreducible representation π of G. Then
PΦ (χ)(e) 6= 0 iff π appears in IndG
                                   K Φ.                                     ✷

Lemma 3. PΦ (χ) is a non-zero function iff it doesn’t vanish for g = e.                ✷

Proposition 2. The mapping PΦ is an algebra epimorphism from the center Z(L1 G))
of the convolution algebra L1 G onto the center Z(L1Φ (G, K)) of the convolution alge-
bra L1Φ (G, K).
    Proof: We have
            PΦ (f1 ∗ f2 ) = εΦ
                             K ∗ (f1 ∗ f2 )      = (f1 ∗ εΦ
                                                          K ) ∗ f2
                          = (f1 ∗ εK ∗ εK ) ∗ f2 = (εK ∗ f1 ) ∗ (εΦ
                                   Φ    Φ            Φ
                                                                   K ∗ f2 )
                          = PΦ f1 ∗ PΦ f2 .
since f1 is central and εΦK is idempotent. Moreover the dimension d of the image of
Z(L1 G)) under PΦ is the number of irreducible characters χ of G such that PΦ (χ) 6= 0;
but PΦ (χ) 6= 0 iff (PΦ χ)(e) 6= 0 and, the number (PΦ (χ))(e) being the multiplicity in
IndGK Φ of the representation π of G whose character is χ, we see that d is just the
number of irreducible representations π of G appearing in IndG K Φ, i. e. the dimension
                    1
of the center of LΦ (G, K).                                                           ✷

linearly span the center of the algebra L1Φ (G, K).
   Proof: The functions h that satisfy the above functional equation are exactly the
complex multiples of the functions PΦ (χ); for a proof (see [6]). Therefore the corollary
follows.                                                                               ✷

                                                  0 1
cosets in G, by
                       ζΛΦ (d(a, 1)) = SΛΦ (a) + q(q + 1)−1 δa,1 δλ,φ ,
where λ (resp. φ) denotes the restriction of the character Λ (resp. Φ) of E × to F × .
  Notice that a = 1 corresponds to the origin in H and a = −1 corresponds to the
antipode of the origin in H. It is not difficult to check that these formulae for the
spherical functions are equivalent to the ones given in [4] for the case Φ = 1.
3.3. A new form for the cuspidal spherical functions for Φ = 1 (char F 6= 2).
For a 6= 1, one has the following new expression for the spherical functions estimated
in [3]
                  ζΛΦ (a) = (q + 1)−1

for a 6= 1, where ε denotes the sign character of F × .

                     4. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
  For this section, G denotes an arbitrary finite group, K any subgroup of G and Φ
any linear character of K.
  Let ĜΦ be set of allthe equivalence classes of irreducible representations of G that
contain the character Φ when restricted to K. For each equivalence class we choose,
once and for all, a representative (π, Vπ ). As usual, for each f in L1 (G), the Fourier
Transform F(f ), valued in the class (π, Vπ ), is the linear operator F in Vπ defined by
                                 1                          1 X
                                    Z
           F(f )(π) := π(f ) :=        f (g)π(g −1)dg :=           f (g)π(g −1).
                                |G| G                      |G| g∈G
  We recall the statement of the Plancherel theorem for a function f ∈ L1Φ (G, K)
                                1 X
                        f (g) =         dπ trace(π(f )π(g));
                                G     Φ
                                      π∈Ĝ

here g ∈ G arbitrary and dπ := dim Vπ .
   For any complex valued function f on G, let | supp(f )| denote the number of
elements of the support of f . That is, the number of points of G where f takes
nonzero values.
Proposition 3 (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle). For any nonzero function
f ∈ L1Φ (G, K) we have
                                               X
                           | supp(f )| (                   dπ ) ≥ |G|.
                                           π∈supp(F(f ))

Here supp(F(f )) is the subset of ĜΦ where F(f ) does not vanish.

     Proof: For any function f on G we recall that
               kf k22 =         |f (x)|2 ; kf k∞ = max |f (x)|; kf k22 ≤ kf k2∞ | supp(f )|
                          X
                                                                                                   (∗)
                                                      x∈G
                          x∈G

  From now on, we fix a G−invariant inner product on Vπ . Then T ∗ denotes the
adjoint of a linear operator T on Vπ with respect to this inner product. Also kT k
denotes the Hilbert-Schmidt norm on End Vπ defined by trace(T S ∗ ), for S, T ∈ End Vπ
  Since f ∈ L1Φ (G, K), as we pointed out before, the Plancherel Theorem says that
we have that supp(f ) is contained in ĜΦ and that
                                 1 X
                         f (x) =         dπ trace(π(f )π(x)).
                                 G     Φ       π∈Ĝ

  The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality applied to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product says
that the first of the two following inequallities is true,
                            trace(π(f )π(x)) ≤ kπ(f )kkπ(x)k ≤ kπ(f )k,
the second inequality follows from the fact that kT k = 1 for a unitary operator.
  Putting together the last two statements we get
                                     1 X
                            kf k∞ ≤          dπ kF(f )(π)k
                                     G     Φ          π∈Ĝ
                                                                                  1   1
The classical Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and the fact that dπ = dπ2 dπ2 imply that
                            1 X
                  kf k2∞ ≤          dπ kF(f )(π)k2
                                                       X
                               2
                                                                 dπ .
                           |G|    Φ                π∈supp(F(f ))
                                           π∈Ĝ
               2
Now the L −version of Plancherel Theorem says that
                                   1 X
                         kf k22 =        dπ kF(f )(π)k2.
                                  |G|  Φ           π∈Ĝ

Therefore,
                                                    1
                                        kf k2∞ ≤       kf k2
                                                             X
                                                                dπ .
                                                   |G|        Φ
                                                             π∈Ĝ
Since f is nonzero, we apply (*) to the above inequality and get the desired result. ✷
