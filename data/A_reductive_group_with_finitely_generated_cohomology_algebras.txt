                                                  schemes.


                                            1     Introduction
                                            Consider a linear algebraic group scheme G defined over a field k of positive
                                            characteristic p. So G is an affine group scheme whose coordinate algebra
                                            k[G] is finitely generated as a k-algebra. We say that G has the cohomo-
                                            logical finite generation property (CFG) if the following holds. Let A be a
                                            finitely generated commutative k-algebra on which G acts rationally by k-
                                            algebra automorphisms. (So G acts on Spec(A).) Then the cohomology ring
                                            H ∗ (G, A) is finitely generated as a k-algebra. Here, as in [8, I.4], we use the
                                            cohomology introduced by Hochschild, also known as ‘rational cohomology’.
                                                In [18] we have shown that SL2 over a field of positive characteristic has
                                            property (CFG). In this paper we explain how to modify the argument so
                                            that it also covers SL3 in characteristic two. We further explain what is
                                            missing to make further progress along the same lines.
                                                Recall that there is no analogous problem in characteristic zero, because
                                            rational cohomology vanishes in higher degrees for any linearly reductive
                                            group.


                                                                                    1
2    Geometric reductivity
Let G be a linear algebraic group scheme defined over the field k. We first
list a number of properties that G may or may not have. They are more
familiar for linear algebraic groups than for linear algebraic group schemes,
but we will need them in the greater generality.
    If G acts rationally by k-algebra automorphisms on a commutative k-
algebra A, we will simply say that G acts on A.

Property (FG) Whenever G acts on a finitely generated k-algebra A, the
ring of invariants AG is a finitely generated k-algebra.

Property (Noeth) Whenever G acts on a finitely generated k-algebra
A, and M is a noetherian A-module on which G acts compatibly (so the
structure map A⊗M → M is a map of G-modules), the module of invariants
M G is noetherian over AG .

Property (Int) Whenever G acts on a finitely generated k-algebra A,
leaving invariant an ideal J, the ring of invariants (A/J)G is integral over
the image of AG .

Remark 2.1 In property (Int) one may drop the condition that A is finitely
generated. The resulting property is equivalent to the original.

Property (GR) (Geometric reductivity) Whenever V is a finite dimen-
sional G-module with one dimensional submodule L on which G acts triv-
ially, there is a homogeneous G-invariant polynomial function f on V with
f (0) = 0, f |L 6= 0.

Property (GRN) Whenever V is a finite dimensional G-module with one
dimensional submodule L on which G acts trivially, the coordinate algebra
k[L] is a noetherian k[V ]G -module. Here k[V ] is of course the coordinate
algebra of V .

Property (GRI) Whenever V is a finite dimensional G-module with one
dimensional submodule L on which G acts trivially, the coordinate algebra
k[L] is integral over the image of k[V ]G .

                                     2
  We may now summarize some invariant theory as follows

Theorem 2.2 The properties (FG), (Noeth), (Int), (GR), (GRN), (GRI)
are equivalent.

Proof That (GR), (GRN), (GRI) are equivalent is pretty obvious, as k[L]
is just a polynomial ring in one variable, and the restriction map k[V ] → k[L]
is a surjective map of graded rings. It is a theorem of Nagata [10] that (GR)
implies (FG). (By [1] the argument also works when G is a group scheme.)
That (FG) implies (Noeth) follows by considering the symmetric algebra
SA (M) on M over A, or by considering its quotient ring with underlying set
A ⊕ M. The rest is easier.                                                   2

  By k-algebra we always mean an associative ring that contains k in its
center.

Lemma 2.3 Let A be a k-algebra and l/k a field extension. Then A is
finitely generated as a k-algebra if and only if A ⊗k l is finitely generated as
an l-algebra.

Proof Field extensions are faithfully flat.                                   2

  Encouraged by this lemma we further assume that k is algebraically closed.

Lemma 2.4 Let G be a finite group scheme over k. Let it act on a commu-
tative k-algebra A. Then A is integral over AG . In particular, G is geomet-
rically reductive.

Proof In view of Theorem 2.2 the last statement may be left as an exercise.
When GQis reduced, hence just a finite group, the lemma is classical: a is a
root of g∈G (x − g(a)). And if G is not reduced, it has its first Frobenius
kernel G1 as a normal subgroup and AG = (AG1 )G/G1 . Now the Lie algebra
[8, I,7.7] acts by derivations on A and G1 acts trivially on the subalgebra
Ap generated by p-th powers. By induction on the rank dimk (k[G]) we may
assume AG1 is integral over AG .                                          2




                                       3
2.1    Reductive
By Haboush [8, II.10.7] reductive groups are geometrically reductive. By
Popov [12] a geometrically reductive linear algebraic group has to be reduc-
tive, and by Waterhouse [20] a linear algebraic group scheme G is geomet-
rically reductive exactly when the connected component Gored of its reduced
subgroup Gred is geometrically reductive.


3     Cohomological variations
We keep our field k algebraically closed of positive characteristic p. We now
introduce cohomological variants of the properties (FG), (Noeth), (Int). We
do not know how to make cohomological variants of (GR), (GRI), (GRN).

Property (CFG) Whenever G acts on a finitely generated k-algebra A,
the cohomology ring H ∗ (G, A) is a finitely generated k-algebra.

Property (CNoeth) Whenever G acts on a finitely generated k-algebra A,
and M is a noetherian A-module on which G acts compatibly, the cohomology
H ∗ (G, M) is noetherian as a module over H ∗(G, A).

Property (CInt) Whenever G acts on a finitely generated k-algebra A,
leaving invariant an ideal J, the even part H even (G, A/J) of the cohomology
ring H ∗ (G, A/J) is integral over the image of H even (G, A).

Remark 3.1 It is not essential to restrict to the even part, but the advantage
of that is that the even part is a commutative ring, so that we do not have
to explain the terminology ‘integral’. In any case, we will see that it is the
even part that truly matters. Note that H ∗(G, A) is a finitely k-algebra if
and only if H even (G, A) is a finitely generated k-algebra and H ∗ (G, A) is a
noetherian module over it.

Remark 3.2 In property (CInt) one may drop the condition that A is
finitely generated. The resulting property is equivalent to the original.

Lemma 3.3 Property (CFG) implies properties (CNoeth) and (Cint).



                                      4
Proof Apply the same reasoning as in the proof of 2.2.                          2

Theorem 3.4 (Evens 1961 [3]) A finite group has property (CFG).
Note that this is stronger than the theorem of Venkov [19], which refers
only to trivial coefficients. Our interest is in nontrivial actions on finitely
generated algebras.
   After many attempts the result of Evens was generalized by Friedlander
and Suslin, but they forgot to make it explicit in the same generality as Evens
did.

Theorem 3.5 (Friedlander and Suslin 1997 [5]) A finite group scheme
has property (CFG).

Proof If G is connected, take C = AG in [5, Theorem 1.5, 1.5.1]. If G
is not connected, one finishes the argument by following [3] as on pages
220–221 of [5]. More specifically, on page 221 of [5] one wants to replace
‘the subalgebra of H ∗ (G, k) generated by the ηi ’ with ‘the C-subalgebra of
H ∗ (G, C) generated by the ηi ’, where C = AG again.                      2

Lemma 3.6 Let G be a linear algebraic group and H a geometrically reduc-
tive subgroup scheme of G. Then G/H is affine.

Proof If H is reduced, see Richardson [13]. If not, choose r so large that
the image of H under the r-th Frobenius homomorphism F r : G → G(r) of [8,
I.9.4] is reduced. This image is then a geometrically reductive linear algebraic
subgroup of the linear algebraic group G(r) . The map G/H → F r (G)/F r (H)
is finite [2, III,§3,5.5b], hence affine, so G/H is affine because F r (G)/F r (H)
is affine.                                                                       2

  Now recall from [18] the following suggestive result.

Lemma 3.7 Let G be a linear algebraic group with property (CFG). Then
any geometrically reductive subgroup scheme H of G also has property (CFG).

Proof The quotient G/H is affine, hence there is no cohomology of quasi-
coherent sheaves to worry about. By [8, I 4.6, I 5.13] one simply gets, when
H acts on a finitely generated A, that H ∗ (H, A) = H ∗ (G, indG H A). And
   G                H
indH A = (k[G] ⊗ A) is finitely generated.                                 2

                                        5
  For instance, if GLn as a group scheme over k satisfies (CFG), then so
does SLn . Conversely, if SLn satisfies (CFG), then so does GLn , because
H ∗ (GLn , A) = H ∗ (SLn , A)Gm for any GLn -algebra A. Further every linear
algebraic group scheme is a subgroup scheme of some GLn —hence of some
SLn+1 —and it is natural to ask

3.1    Problem
Prove that the linear algebraic group SLn over k has property (CFG).

  We now recall a principle that is a key ingredient in the proofs of theorems
3.4 and 3.5. First a definition.

Definition 3.8 We say that a spectral sequence

                              Er ⇒ Abutment

stops if there is an integer r0 so that the differential dr : Er → Er vanishes
for r ≥ r0 .
   We now formulate the principle as a slogan.

Lemma 3.9 A noetherian spectral sequence stops.
   Let us explain what we mean by that. Assume an associative ring R acts
on the levels of a spectral sequence

                              Er ⇒ Abutment

in such a manner that each differential dr : Er → Er is an R-module map and
each isomorphism ker dr / im dr ∼
                                = Er+1 is R-linear. Say the spectral sequence
starts at level two. Assume that E2 is a noetherian R-module. Then the
spectral sequence stops. The proof is easy. One writes Er as Zr /Br where
Zr , Br are the appropriate submodules of E2 . As the Br form an ascending
sequence, we must have an s so that Br = Bs for r ≥ s. Then dr vanishes
for r ≥ s.




                                      6
   In the examples where the lemma is applied one often has a multiplicative
structure on the spectral sequence and the R-module structure of E2 comes
from a graded ring map R → E2 . Say E2 is a finitely generated k-algebra,
which we think of as given. Then to show that E2 is a noetherian R-module
one wants to see that the image of R in E2 is big enough. Indeed the subring
E2even ∩ image(R) should be so big that E2even is integral over it. Thus the
paradoxical situation is that in order to prove finite generation results (for
an abutment) one needs to exhibit enough images (of elements of R in E2 ).
That is why we will be looking for universal cohomology classes (to take cup
product with).

3.2    The Grosshans family
From now on let G be the linear algebraic group SLn over k. If G acts on
a finitely generated commutative k-algebra A, Grosshans has studied in [6]
a flat family over the affine line with general fiber A and special fiber gr A.
Here gr A is of course the associated graded ring with respect to a certain
filtration. We write A for the finitely generated k-algebra whose spectrum
is the total space of the family. In characteristic zero the family had been
studied earlier by Popov, and in characteristic p a variant of gr A had been
crucial in work of Mathieu [9]. It was the more recent book [7] that alerted
us to possible relevance of the family in the present context.

3.3    Good filtrations
We choose a Borel group B + = T U + of upper triangular matrices and the
opposite Borel group B − . The roots of B + are positive. If λ ∈ X(T ) is
dominant, then indG  B − (λ) is the ‘dual Weyl module’ or ‘costandard module’
∇G (λ) with highest weight λ. The formula ∇G (λ) = indG       B − (λ) just means
that ∇G (λ) is obtained from the Borel-Weil construction: ∇G (λ) equals
H 0 (G/B − , L) for a certain line bundle on the flag variety G/B − . In a good
filtration of a G-module the layers are traditionally required to be of the form
∇G (µ). However, to avoid irrelevant contortions when dealing with infinite
dimensional G-modules, it is important to allow a layer to be a direct sum of
any number of copies of the same ∇G (µ). We always follow that convention
(compare [8, II.4.16 Remark 1]). We refer to [17] and [8] for proofs of the
main properties of good filtrations. If M is a G-module, and m ≥ −1 is an
integer so that H m+1 (G, ∇G (µ) ⊗ M) = 0 for all dominant µ, then we say

                                       7
as in [4] that M has good filtration dimension at most m. The case m = 0
corresponds with M having a good filtration. And for m ≥ 0 it means that
M has a resolution
                       0 → M → N0 → · · · → Nm → 0
in which the Ni have good filtration. We say that M has good filtration
dimension precisely m, notation dim∇ (M) = m, if m is minimal so that M
has good filtration dimension at most m. In that case H i+1 (G, ∇G (µ)⊗M) =
0 for all dominant µ and all i ≥ m. In particular H i+1 (G, M) = 0 for i ≥ m.
If there is no finite m so that dim∇ (M) = m, then we put dim∇ (M) = ∞.

Lemma 3.10 Let 0 → M ′ → M → M ′′ → 0 be exact.
  1. dim∇ (M) ≤ max(dim∇ (M ′ ), dim∇ (M ′′ )),
  2. dim∇ (M ′ ) ≤ max(dim∇ (M), dim∇ (M ′′ ) + 1),
  3. dim∇ (M ′′ ) ≤ max(dim∇ (M), dim∇ (M ′ ) − 1),
  4. dim∇ (M ′ ⊗ M ′′ ) ≤ dim∇ (M ′ ) + dim∇ (M ′′ ).                      2

3.4    Filtering A
If M is a G-module, and λ is a dominant weight, then M≤λ denotes the
largest G-submodule all whose weights µ satisfy µ ≤ λ in the usual partial
order [8, II 1.5]. For example, M≤0 = M G . Similarly M<λ denotes the
largest G-submodule all whose weights µ satisfy µ < λ. As in [17], we form
the X(T )-graded module
                                   M
                       grX(T ) M =      M≤λ /M<λ .
                                     λ∈X(T )

We convert it to a Z-graded module
                                P through    an additive height function
                                      ∨
ht : X(T ) → Z defined by ht = 2 α>0 α , the sum being over the positive
roots. In other words, we put
                                  X
                            M≤i =      M≤λ
                                      ht(λ)≤i

and then gr M is the associated graded module of the filtration M≤0 ⊆
M≤1 · · ·. We apply this in particular to our finitely generated commutative

                                       8
k-algebra with G action A. This construction of gr A goes back to Mathieu
[9]. From Grosshans we learn to look at the specialization maps A → gr A
and A → A ([18, 4.10, 4.11]).

3.5    Cohomology of the associated graded algebra
Under the technical assumption, hopefully unnecessary, that either n ≤ 5 or
p > 2n , we have shown in [18, 3.8] that there is a Hochschild-Serre spectral
sequence
              E2ij = H i (G/Gr , H j (Gr , gr A)) ⇒ H i+j (G, gr A)
which stops. Here Gr is an appropriately chosen Frobenius kernel in G = SLn .
(The choice of r is not constructive. In contrast to the work of Friedlander
and Suslin we get only qualitative results.) The fact that the spectral se-
quence stops was derived from an estimate of good filtration dimensions, not
by lemma 3.9.
   From the stopping of the spectral sequence one gets

Theorem 3.11 [18, Thm 1.1] Let SLn act on the finitely generated k-algebra
A. If n < 6 or p > 2n , then H ∗ (SLn , gr A) is finitely generated as a k-algebra.
   The filtration A≤0 ⊆ A≤1 · · · induces a filtration of the Hochschild com-
plex [8, I.4.14] whence a spectral sequence

                 E(A) : E1ij = H i+j (G, gr−i A) ⇒ H i+j (G, A).

It lives in an unusual quadrant, but as long as the E1 is a finitely generated
k-algebra this causes no difficulty with convergence: given m there will be
only finitely many nonzero E1m−i,i . (Compare [18, 4.11]. Note that in [18]
the E1 is mistaken for an E2 .)
     Thus theorem 3.11 leads to the question whether the spectral sequence
E(A) also stops. If it does, then we have no difficulty in transferring the finite
generation from E1 to abutment. (As the differentials are derivations, the p-
th power of a homogeneous element of even degree in Er automatically passes
to Er+1 . That makes that Er+1 is finitely generated when Er is.) As ring of
operators to act on this spectral sequence we may take R = H ∗ (G, A), with
A the coordinate ring of the Grosshans family ([18, 4.11, 4.12]). The trick
is then to show that the natural map R → E1 makes E1 into a noetherian
module. If SLn has property (CNoeth) or (CInt), then this is clear because
gr A is a quotient of A. We conclude

                                        9
Theorem 3.12 If n < 6 or p > 2n , then properties (CFG), (CNoeth), (CInt)
are equivalent for SLn .
    To show that E1 is a noetherian R-module we wish to have some idea of
the size of the image of R in E1 , and also of the size of E1 itself. Our E1 is
the abutment of the earlier Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. So we look
back at that spectral sequence and try to get it also noetherian over R, even
though we already know it stops! Looking at the proof of its stopping we
see that actually the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence is noetherian over
H even (G, gr A). So it would follow from property (CInt) that the Hochschild-
Serre spectral sequence is indeed noetherian over R. But let us look more
directly at the image of Reven = H even (SLn , A) in H 0 (G/Gr , H ∗ (Gr , gr A)).

3.6     Two module structures
Friedlander and Suslin did not just show that H ∗ (Gr , gr A) is a finitely gen-
erated k-algebra, they actually provide an explicit finitely generated graded
k-algebra S ∗ with G action so that a natural graded map (A)Gr ⊗ S ∗ →
H ∗ (Gr , gr A) makes the target into a noetherian module over the source.
(We suppress in the notation that S ∗ depends on n and r.) Here the sub-
group scheme Gr acts trivially on S ∗ , so that we also have an action of G/Gr
on (A)Gr ⊗ S ∗ . Then of course H 0 (G/Gr , H ∗ (Gr , gr A)) is also a noetherian
H 0 (G/Gr , (A)Gr ⊗ S ∗ )-module. Thus we like to compare the images of Reven
and H 0 (G, (A)Gr ⊗ S ∗ ) = H 0 (G/Gr , (A)Gr ⊗ S ∗ ) in H 0(G/Gr , H ∗ (Gr , gr A)).
More specifically, we would like the image of Reven to contain the image of
H 0 (G, (A)Gr ⊗ S ∗ ). That will prove that the E2 of the Hochschild-Serre
spectral sequence is a noetherian R-module (cf. [18, Prop. 3.8]). It suf-
fices to factor the map H 0 (G, (A)Gr ⊗ S 2m ) → H 0 (G/Gr , H 2m (Gr , gr A))
through H 2m (G, A). This is why one would like to have universal classes
in H 2m (G, (S 2m )# ), where we use V # as a notation for the linear dual of a
vector space V . Taking cup product with such a class yields a map from
H 0 (G, (A)Gr ⊗ S 2m ) to H 2m (G, (A)Gr ) and then one has to show that this
map fits in the obvious way in a commutative diagram. This then necessitates
putting restrictions on the universal class.




                                         10
4     Universal cohomology classes
Having explained why we care about having certain universal cohomology
classes, let us now get more specific. Further details are given in [18]. Recall
that G = SLn over an algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic p.
    Let W2 (k) = W (k)/p2W (k) be the ring of Witt vectors of length two over
k, see [14, II §6]. If V is a module for G (or for GLn ) we write V (r) for the
r-th Frobenius twist of V . One has an extension of algebraic groups

                   1 → gl(1)
                         n → GLn (W2 (k)) → GLn (k) → 1,

whence a cocycle class e1 ∈ H 2 (GLn , gl(1)
                                           n ). We call it the Witt vector class
for GLn . Its m-th cup power defines an element e∪m   1    in H 2m (G, (gl(1)
                                                                          n )
                                                                               ⊗m
                                                                                  ).
         (1) ⊗m                                  m   (1)
Now (gln )         contains the divided power Γ (gln ) as the submodule of
invariants under permutation of the m factors. We wish to lift e∪m          1    to
a class in H 2m (G, Γm (gl(1)
                            n  )), in such a manner  that    some  natural    prop-
erties are satisfied. Recall that we have for i ≥ 1, j ≥ 1 an inclusion
∆i,j : Γi+j (gl(1)      i  (1)      j  (1)
               n ) → Γ (gln ) ⊗ Γ (gln ).

Definition 4.1 We call the pair of integers a, b special if there is i ≥ 0 with
a = pi and 1 ≤ b ≤ (p − 1)a. If a, b is a special pair, then so is aps , bps for
any s ≥ 0. Any integer larger than one can be written uniquely as a + b with
a, b special.

4.1    Lifting Problem
Put c[1] = e1 . Show that there are c[m] ∈ H 2m (G, Γm (gl(1)
                                                          n )) so that for
every special pair a, b one has

                          (∆a,b )∗ (c[a + b]) = c[a] ∪ c[b]

in H 2(a+b) (G, Γa (gl(1)    b   (1)
                      n ) ⊗ Γ (gln )).

Remark 4.2 In [18, Thm 4.4] we required (∆a,b )∗ (c[a + b]) = c[a] ∪ c[b] for
all pairs a, b with a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1.

Remark 4.3 Look at the restriction of c[m] to H 2m (G1 , Γm (gl(1)       n )) =
  2m           m   (1)                      even            m    (1)
H (G1 , k) ⊗ Γ (gln ). The ring ⊕m≥0 H (G1 , k) ⊗ Γ (gln ) is a divided
power algebra over H even (G1 , k) and the restriction of c[m] to G1 is the m-th
divided power of the restriction of e1 .

                                         11
  If one has solved the lifting problem and n ≤ 5 or p > 2n , then one
can construct the universal classes in H 2m (G, (S 2m )# ) alluded to above and
thus establish that G has property (CFG). This is what we did in [18] for
G = SL2 , except that—as mentioned in the remark 4.2—we gave the c[m]
some more properties than we require now. So we must have another look
at the proof of [18, Lemma 4.7]. In this proof we must now take a, b special.
The multiplication S a (gln#(r) ) ⊗ S b (gln#(r) ) → S a+b (gln#(r) ) is surjective, so
that it still follows by induction that the cup product with ci [a + b](r−i) takes
the desired values. As for the second part of the lemma, the restriction to
H 2p (G1 , gl(r)
    r−1
                n ) is the same as before by remark 4.3, [18, 4.6]. All in all the
proofs in [18] generalize as soon as one has solved the lifting problem and
n ≤ 5 or p > 2n . But we do not have a method to decide the lifting problem
in general.

   In our solution of the lifting problem for SL2 in [18] we used that the unipo-
tent radical of a Borel subgroup is abelian. That may be P      true for SL2 , but
it fails for SL3 , so we have to argue differently. Put ρ∨ = α simple α∨ , so
that ρ∨ (̟i ) = 1 for every fundamental weight ̟i . The following proposition
provides the missing link to deal with SL3 in characteristic two. It also gives
a new proof for the SL2 case.

Proposition 4.4 Let n = 2 or let n = 3 and p = 2. Let m ≥ 0. Let M be a
G-module with ρ∨ (λ) ≤ m for every weight λ of M. Then the good filtration
dimension dim∇ (M (1) ) of M (1) is at most m.

Corollary 4.5 Let n = 2 or let n = 3 and p = 2. The maps

      (∆a,b )∗ : H 2(a+b) (G, Γa+b (gl(1)
                                      n )) → H
                                               2(a+b)
                                                      (G, Γa (gl(1)    b   (1)
                                                                n ) ⊗ Γ (gln ))

are surjective for a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1, so that the c[m] of problem 4.1 exist and
property (CFG) holds for G.

Proof The cokernel C of ∆a,b satisfies H 2(a+b) (G, C) = 0, because
dim∇ (C) < 2(a + b).                                             2

Proof of Proposition This is rather straightforward. One starts with
checking that the cokernel of ∇(̟i )(1) → ∇(p̟i ) has a good filtration for
each fundamental weight ̟i . This fails for other values of n, p. Let us use

                                          12
induction on m. The case m = 0 of the proposition is clear. Let m > 0
and assume the result for strictly smaller values. We may assume M is
finite dimensional and, taking a composition series, we may assume M is a
simple module L(λ) of high weight λ with ρ∨ (λ) = m. Choose ̟i so that
µ = λ − ̟i is dominant. Then dim∇ (∇(µ)(1) ⊗ ∇(̟i )(1) ) ≤ ρ∨ (µ) + 1 ≤ m
and the cokernel of the embedding L(λ)(1) → ∇(µ)(1) ⊗ ∇(̟i )(1) has good
filtration dimension strictly less than m by induction.                 2
Remark 4.6 There is a reason why proposition 4.4 does not hold for other
combinations of n, p. We now sketch this reason. If V is the defin-
ing representation of GLn then as another corollary one gets a surjec-
tion H 4 (G, Γ2 (V (1) )) ⊗ Γ2 (V (1)# )) → H 4 (G, (gl(1)   ⊗2
                                                          n ) ). In particular, let
τ ∈ H 4 (G, Γ2 (V (1) )) ⊗ Γ2 (V (1)# )) lift e1 ∪ e1 . Then cup product with τ de-
scribes a component of the homomorphism S ∗ ((V ⊗ V # )# ) → H even (G1 , k)
that describes the connection [16, Thm 5.2] between cohomology of G1 and
the restricted nullcone. (The restricted nullcone consists of the n by n ma-
trices whose p-th power is zero.) But then the restricted nullcone can only
contain matrices of rank at most one: Two by two minors, viewed as elements
of S 2 ((V ⊗ V # )# ), are annihilated by Γ2 (V )) ⊗ Γ2 (V # ), viewed as subspace
of (S 2 ((V ⊗ V # )# )# . That leaves only n = 2 or n = 3 and p = 2.
Corollary 4.7 (cf. [18, Cor. 4.13]) Let n = 2 or let n = 3 and p = 2. Let A
be a finitely generated algebra with good filtration and let M be a noetherian
A-module on which G acts compatibly. Then M has finite good filtration
dimension.
Remark 4.8 We find this surprising. We would have expected some
smoothness condition on A or some flatness condition on M to be needed.
This makes one wonder if a finitely generated algebra with good filtration
is always a quotient of a smooth finitely generated algebra with good fil-
tration. Note that the corollary forbids an algebra to be such a quotient
when the algebra does not have finite good filtration dimension. In any
case, this may be a good place to look when trying to defeat our expecta-
tion that SLn always satisfies (CFG). On the other hand, in a later preprint
(arXiv:math.RT/0405238) we show that the corollary extends to the cases
where n < 6 or p > 2n .

Proof of Corollary We repeat the proof of [18, Cor. 4.13]. Let k[G/U]
denote the multicone indG
                        U k. Recall that, for finite d, the good filtration


                                        13
dimension of M is at most d if and only if H d+1 (G, M ⊗ k[G/U]) vanishes.
Now note that M ⊗ k[G/U] is a noetherian A ⊗ k[G/U]-module and note
that H ∗ (G, A ⊗ k[G/U]) is concentrated in degree zero.                2
