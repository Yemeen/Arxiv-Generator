                                                   Let G be a complex, semisimple, simply-connected algebraic group and B ⊆ G a Borel sub-
                                             group. We fix a smooth closed complex projective variety X and a principal algebraic B-bundle
                                                                 π
                                             over it: B −→ E −→X. For any complex algebraic variety F with a left algebraic B-action, we
                                             denote by E(F ) the total space of the associated fibre bundle with fibre F . Thus E(F ) = E ×B F
                                             and the projection to X is obtained from projection on the first factor.
                                                   Fix a maximal torus T ⊆ B and let W be its Weyl group. For each w ∈ W the Bruhat cell
                                             Yw◦ = BwB ⊆ G/B and the Schubert variety Yw = BwB ⊆ G/B are B-stable subsets of G/B so
                                             we have inclusions of bundles E(Yw◦ ) ⊆ E(Yw ) ⊆ E(G/B). The closed subvarieties Ωw = E(Yw )
                                             determine classes [OΩw ] in K(E(G/B))†. In fact, by a well known result of Grothendieck, these
                                             classes form a K(X)-basis for K(E(G/B)). On E(G/B)) we also have “homogeneous” line bundles
                                             associated to irreducible representations of B (see below). The main result of this announcement
                                             is a formula for the tensor product of the class of a homogeneous line bundle with a Schubert class,
                                             expressed as a K(X)-linear combination of Schubert classes.
                                                   We believe that this formula is the most general uniform result in the intersection theory
                                             of Schubert classes: it is related to a recent result of Fulton and Lascoux [FL] who presented a
                                             similar formula for a GLn (C)/B-bundle. Indeed, in this case, their formula and ours coincide once
                                             one knows how to translate between their combinatorics with tableaux and ours with Littelmann
                                             paths. O. Mathieu has also proved the positivity which is implied by our formula, see [FP, p. 101].
                                             Applying the Chern character to our formula, and equating the lowest order terms we obtain a
                                             relative version of the result of Chevalley [Ch] alluded to in the title of this paper.
                                                   The ring K(E(G/B)) is a K(X)-module via the map π ∗ : K(X) → K(E(G/B)). Since G/B
                                             has a unique fixed point for the B-action there is a canonical section σ: X → E(G/B) of the bundle

                                                   For any smooth variety V , K(V ) is the Grothendieck ring of coherent OV -modules.

where the vertical maps are quotients by the right action of B on G; precisely, E(G/B) ≃ (E ×B
G)/B. Thus ρ is the projection map of a principal B-bundle over E(G/B).
    There are two vector bundles naturally associated to each B-module V :

                  E(V ) −→ X,        and        EG (V ) = E(G) ×B V −→ E(G/B),

where the projection map for the latter of these is via ρ. This assignment V 7→ EG (V ) of B-
modules to vector bundles over E(G/B) preserves direct sums and tensor products, and hence
                                      φ
induces a ring homomorphism R(B)−→K(E(G/B)), where R(B) is the representation ring of B.
By construction σ ∗ (EG (V )) = E(V ) as vector bundles on X. One also checks that if V is the
restriction of a G module, then EG (V ) = π ∗ (σ ∗ (EG (V ))). Thus we have a commutative diagram

                                  R(G)
                                       −− →              K(X)

                                  R(B)   −→             K(E(G/B))

and a map
                                                     π ∗ ⊗φ
                             K(X) ⊗R(G) R(B)         −→       K(E(G/B)),
where R(G) is the representation ring of G and the R(G)-action on K(X) is given by the map
V 7→ E(V ).
     Let P be the weight lattice of g = Lie(G). Then R(B) = R(T ) ∼ = Z[P ], the group algebra of
P , and R(G) = R(T )W . If λ ∈ P , let eλ be the corresponding element of R(T ) and define

                  xλ = E(eλ ) ∈ K(X)          and      y λ = EG (eλ ) ∈ K(E(G/B)).              (1)

The statement that EG (V ) = π ∗ (σ ∗ (EG (V ))) if V is a G-module is equivalent to the statement
that, in K(E(G/B)),

                 χ(x) = E(χ)    is equal to     χ(y) = EG (χ),     for all χ ∈ R(T )W .

We recall from [P] that R(T ) is a free R(G)-module of rank |W |, and that R(T ) ⊗R(G) Z −→
K(G/B) is an isomorphism.† According to Steinberg, [S] there is an R(G) basis of R(T ) of the
form {eεw | w ∈ W }, where the εw are certain specific elements of P . Since the set {y εw | w ∈ W }
is a set of globally defined elements in K(E(G/B)) which behaves properly under restriction,
and which forms a basis locally, it follows from standard yoga that it is also is a K(X)-basis for
K(E(G/B)). Thus the map K(X) ⊗R(G) R(T ) −→ K(E(G/B)) is an isomorphism and

                                                     K(X) ⊗ R(T )
                                  K(E(G/B)) ∼
                                            =                     ,                             (2)
                                                          I
where I is the ideal in K(X) ⊗ R(T ) generated by the set {χ(x) ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ χ | χ ∈ R(T )W }.
    Define a W -action on K(X) ⊗ R(T ) as the K(X)-linear extension of the action given by

                                wy λ = y wλ ,       for w ∈ W , λ ∈ P .

This action descends to an action on K(E(G/B) since the generators of the ideal I are W -invariants
for this action. Using this W -action on K(E(G/B)), we can define the analogues of BGG-operators
    †
    The discussion in [P] is entirely in terms of compact groups and the K-theory of C ∞ vector
bundles; with trivial modifications the results hold in the present context also.

in this context. Such operators were defined in the “absolute case” (X = pt) by Demazure,
in KT (G/B) by Kostant and Kumar [KK], and finally by Fulton and Lascoux [FL] when G =
SL(n, C). To make the definition, let α be a positive root with respect to the pair (B, T ) and let
sα ∈ W be the corresponding reflection. Define Tα : R(T ) → R(T ) by defining

                                  Tα (eλ ) = (eλ+α − sα (eλ))/(eα − 1)

and extending Z-linearly. Since Tα fixes elements of R(T )W this operation can be extended K(X)-
linearly to a well defined operator on K(E(G/B)).
     Now fix a simple system of roots α1 , . . . , αℓ for (B, T ) and let Pj be the minimal parabolic
subgroup corresponding to αj ; this is the closed connected subgroup of G whose Lie algebra pj is
spanned by the Lie algebra b of B and the root space g−αj . Let fj : E(G/B) −→ E(G/Pj ) be the
projection induced from the B-equivariant P1 -bundle G/B −→ G/Pj (the canonical projection).
The following result explains the geometric significance of the operators Tαj (henceforth abbrevi-
ated as Tj ). P. Deligne pointed out an error in the proof of (a) below in an earlier version of this
preprint. We are grateful to him for pointing this out and have corrected the argument.

Proposition. With the notation as above
                               
                                [OΩwsj ], if ℓ(wsj ) > ℓ(w),
(a) (fj )! ◦ (fj )! ([OΩw ]) =
                                 [OΩw ],   if ℓ(wsj ) < ℓ(w).
                               

(b) For any element x ∈ K(E(G/B)), (fj )! ◦ (fj )! (x) = Tj (x).

Proof. (a) Let w̄ = {w, wsj } be the coset of w relative to hsj i. The essential point is to prove the
following two equations
                                  f! [OΩv ] = [OΩw̄ ],   for v ∈ w̄,
where Ωw̄ ⊆ E(G/Pj ) is the relative Schubert variety constructed from Yw̄ ⊆ E(G/Pj ). In turn,
these equations will follow from the isomorphisms

                  (i) f∗ (OΩv ) = OΩw̄ ,         (ii)   Rq f∗ (OΩv ),   for q > 0, v ∈ w̄.

     To prove (i) and (ii) relabel the elements of w̄ as w′ and w′′ where w′ < w′′ . Then f : Ωw′ → Ωw̄
is birational, and since the varieties in question have at worst rational singularities, (i) and (ii)
for w′ follow from known arguments. Secondly f : Ωw′′ → Ωw̄ is a P1 -bundle, so (i) and (ii)
are standard. Finally f ! [OΩw̄ ] = [OΩw′′ ] follows because, in this case, f is the projection of a
P1 -bundle.
(b) There is a 2-dimensional algebraic vector bundle Ej −→ E(G/Pj ) associated to a 2-dimensional
representation of Pj . Its projectivization is E(G/B), i.e. P(Ej ) ≃ E(G/B) as bundles over
E(G/Pj ). It follows that K(E(G/B)) is a free module over K(E(G/Pj )) on two generators, 1 and
Lωj , where ωj is the j th fundamental weight. Since both sides are K(X)-linear, it suffices to check
the assertion for 1 and Lωj , and this reduces to the “same” computation as in the absolute case.

     The operators Ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ, satisfy Ti2 = Ti and the generalized braid relations. For each
w ∈ W , let w = si1 · · · sip be a reduced word for w and define Tw = Ti1 · · · Tip . Since the Ti satisfy
the braid relations, the operators Tw are well defined and, by the above Proposition,

                                 [OΩw ] = Tw−1 [OΩ1 ],        for w ∈ W .                             (3)

      For each λ ∈ P let Y λ be the “left multiplication” operator on K(E(G/B)) defined by Y λ (x) =
y λ x. Since [OΩ1 ] = σ(X),
                                          Y λ [OΩ1 ] = xλ [OΩ1 ],                                (4)
where xλ is as in (1). As operators on K(E(G/B)),

                                                             Y λ − Y si λ
                                     Y λ Ti = Ti Y si λ +                 ,                          (5)
                                                             1 − Y −αi

where the second term is always viewed as a linear combination Y µ , µ ∈ P . We will iterate this
formula to obtain an expansion of the product eλ [OXw ] in K(G/B) in terms of the K(X)-basis
{[OXv ] | v ∈ W } of K(E(G/B). The path model of P. Littelmann [Li] is exactly what is needed
for controlling the resulting expansion.
      Let h∗ = R ⊗ P be the real span of the weight lattice. A path in h∗ is a piecewise linear map
π: [0, 1] → h∗ such that π(0) = 0. P. Littelmann [Li] defined root operators f1 , . . . , fℓ which act on
the paths. The action of a root operator fi on a path π either produces another path or returns 0.
      Let λ be a dominant integral weight and let Wλ be the stabilizer of λ. The cosets in W/Wλ
are partially ordered by the Bruhat-Chevalley order. Let πλ be the path given by

                       πλ (t) = tλ, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1,       and let    T λ = {fi1 fi2 · · · fil πλ }

be the set of all paths obtained by applying sequences of root operators fi = fαi , 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ to πλ .
Each path π ∈ T λ can be encoded with a pair of sequences

                  ~τ    = (τ1 > τ2 > · · · > τr ),             τi ∈ W/Wλ ,                  and
                  ~a    = (0 = a0 < a1 < a2 < · · · < ar = 1),      ai ∈ Q,

so that π is given by

                  π(t) = (t − aj−1 )τj λ +         (ai − ai−1 )τi λ,      for aj−1 ≤ t ≤ aj .

The initial direction of π is ι(π) = τ1 and the endpoint of π is π(1) ∈ h∗ .
    Fix w ∈ W , let w̄ = wWλ ∈ W/Wλ and assume that π is a path in the set
                                      λ
                                     T≤w = {π ∈ T λ | ι(π) ≤ w̄}.

A maximal lift of ~τ with respect to w is a choice of representatives ti ∈ W of the cosets τi such that
w ≥ t1 > · · · > tr and each ti is maximal in Bruhat order such that ti−1 > ti . The final direction
of π with respect to w is
                                              v(π, w) = tr ,
where w ≥ t1 > · · · > tr is a maximal lift of τ1 > . . . > τr with respect to w.

Theorem. Let λ be a dominant integral weight and let w ∈ W . Then
                                                     X

                                   a pieri-chevalley formula                                  5

 Sketch of proof. Fix a simple root αi . Every path is in a unique αi -string of paths

                                  Sαi (π) = {fim π, . . . , fi2 π, fi π, π},

 where fim π = 0 and there does not exist any path η such that fi η = π. In a manner similar to
 that of [Li, Lemma 5.3] one easily shows that, for any αi -string Sαi (π),
                               X
                                         Tv(η,w)−1 Y η(1) = Tv(π,w−1 ) Y π(1) Ti .
                             η∈Sαi (π)


 Given these facts, the proof of the Theorem follows the same lines as the proof of the Demazure
 character formula given in [Li, 5.5].

     By applying the formula in the Theorem to the element [OΩ1 ] ∈ K(E(G/B)) and using (3)
 and (4) we obtain the following.

 Corollary. Let λ be a dominant integral weight and let w ∈ W . In K(E(G/B)),
                                                    X
                                   y λ [OΩw ] =            [OΩv(η,w) ]xη(1) .
