                                             1. Introduction
                                                  Let π be an irreducible unitary representation of a group G. A branching
                                             law is the irreducible decomposition of π when restricted to a subgroup G′ :
                                                                           Z   ⊕
                                                                π|G′   ≃           mπ (τ )τ dµ(τ )    (a direct integral).                 (1.1)
                                                                           c′
                                                                           G

                                             Such a decomposition is unique, for example, if G′ is a reductive Lie group, and
                                             the multiplicity mπ : Gc′ → N ∪ {∞} makes sense as a measurable function on the
                                             unitary dual G c′ .
                                                  Special cases of branching problems include (or reduce to) the followings:
                                             Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, Littlewood-Richardson rules, decomposition of tensor
                                             product representations, character formulas, Blattner formulas, Plancherel theorems
                                             for homogeneous spaces, description of breaking symmetries in quantum mechanics,
                                             theta-lifting in automorphic forms, etc. The restriction of unitary representations
                                             serves also as a method to study discontinuous groups for non-Riemannian homo-
                                             geneous spaces (e.g. [Mg, Oh]).

      Our interest is in the branching problems for (non-compact) reductive Lie
groups G ⊃ G′ . In this generality, there is no known algorithm to find branching
laws. Even worse, branching laws usually contain both discrete and continuous spec-
trum with possibly infinite multiplicities (the multiplicity is infinite, for example,
in the decomposition of the tensor product of two principal series representations
of SL(n, C) for n ≥ 3, [Ge-Gr]).
      The author introduced the notion of admissible restrictions and infini-
tesimal discrete decomposability in [Ko5 ] and [Ko9 ], respectively, seeking for
a good framework of branching problems, in which we could expect especially a
simple and detailed study of branching laws, which in turn might become powerful
methods in other fields as well where restrictions of representations naturally arise.
      The criterion in Theorem B indicates that there is a fairly rich examples of
admissible restrictions; some are known and the others are new. In this framework, a
number of explicit branching laws have been newly found (e.g. [D-Vs, Gr-W1,2 , Hu-
P-S, Ko1,3,4,8 , Ko-Ø1,2 , Li2 , Lo1,2 , X]). The point here is that branching problems
become accessible by algebraic techniques if there is no continuous spectrum.
      The first half of this article surveys briefly a general theory of admissible
restrictions both from analytic and algebraic view points (§2, §3). For the simplicity
of exposition, we restrict ourselves to unitary representations, although a part of the
theory can be generalized to non-unitary representations. The second half discusses
some applications of discretely decomposable restrictions. The topics range from
representation theory itself (§4) to some other fields such as Lp -analysis on non-
symmetric homogeneous spaces (§5) and topology of modular varieties (§6).

2. Admissible restrictions to subgroups
                                         b In light of (1.1), we introduce:
      Let G′ be a subgroup of G, and π ∈ G.
Definition 2.1. We say the restriction π|G′ is G′ -admissible if it decomposes
                                                              c′ .
discretely and the multiplicity mπ (τ ) is finite for any τ ∈ G
      One can easily prove the following assertion:
Theorem A ([Ko5 , Theorem 1.2]). Let G ⊃ G′ ⊃ G′′ be a chain of groups, and
    b If the restriction π|G′′ is G′′ -admissible, then π|G′ is G′ -admissible.
π ∈ G.
      Throughout this article, we shall treat the setting as below:
Definition 2.2. We say (G, G′ ) is a pair of reductive Lie groups if
    1) G is a real reductive linear Lie group or its finite cover, and
    2) G′ is a closed subgroup, and is reductive in G.
Then, we shall fix maximal compact subgroups K ⊃ K ′ of G ⊃ G′ , respectively.
     A typical example is a reductive symmetric pai (G, G′ ), by which we mean
that G is as above and that G′ is an open subgroup of the set Gσ of the fixed points of
an involutive automorphism σ of G. For example, (G, G′ ) = (GL(n, C), GL(n, R)),
(SL(n, R), SO(p, n − p)) are the cases.
                Branching Problems of Unitary Representations                    617

    Let (G, G′ ) be a pair of reductive Lie groups. Here are previously known
examples of admissible restrictions:
Example 2.3. The restriction π|G′ is G′ -admissible in the following cases:
 1) (Harish-Chandra’s admissibility theorem) π ∈ G   b is arbitrary and G′ = K.
 2) (Howe, [Ho1 ]) π is the Segal-Shale-Weil representation of the metaplectic group
    G, and its subgroup G′ = G′1 G′2 forms a dual pair with G′1 compact.
      In these examples, either the subgroup G′ or the representation π is very
special, namely, G′ is compact or π has a highest weight. Surprisingly, without such
assumptions, it can happen that the restriction π|G′ is G′ -admissible. The following
criterion asserts that the “balance” of G′ and π is crucial to the G′ -admissibility.
Theorem B (criterion for admissible restrictions, [Ko7 ]). Let G ⊃ G′ be a
                                      b If
pair of reductive Lie groups, and π ∈ G.

                            Cone(G′ ) ∩ ASK (π) = {0},                          (2.1)

then the restriction π|K ′ is K ′ -admissible. In particular, the restriction π|G′ is
G′ -admissible, namely, decomposes discretely with finite multiplicity.
     A main tool of the proof of Theorem B is the microlocal study of characters
by using the singularity spectrum of hyperfunctions. The idea goes back to Atiyah,
Howe, Kashiwara and Vergne [A, Ho2 , Ks-Vr] in the late ’70s. The novelty of
Theorem B is to establish a framework of admissible restrictions with a number
of new examples of interest, which rely on a deeper understanding of the unitary
dual developed largely in the ’80s (see [Kn-Vo] and references therein).
     Let us briefly explain the notation used in Theorem B. We write k′0 ⊂ k0 for
the Lie algebras of K ′ ⊂ K, respectively. Take a Cartan subalgebra t0 of k0 . Then,
ASK (π) is the asymptotic K-support of π ([Ks-Vr]), and Cone(G′ ) is defined as
                                      √                      ⊥
                       Cone(G′ ) :=       −1(t∗0 ∩ Ad∗ (K)(k′0 )).              (2.2)
                                                             √
By definition, both ASK (π) and Cone(G′ ) are closed cones in −1t∗0 .
Example 2.4. If G′ = K, then the assumption (2.1) is automatically fulfilled
because Cone(G′ ) = {0}. The conclusion of Theorem B in this special case is
nothing but Harish-Chandra’s admissibility theorem (Example 2.3 (1)).
     To apply Theorem B for non-compact G′ , we rewrite the assumption (2.1)
more explicitly in specific settings. On the part Cone(G′ ), we mention:
                                               √       −σ
Example 2.5. Cone(G′ ) is a linear subspace −1(t∗0 ) (modulo the Weyl group)
        ′
if (G, G ) is a reductive symmetric pair given by an involution σ. Here, we have
chosen a Cartan subalgebra t0 to be maximally σ-split.
     On the part ASK (π), let us consider a unitary representation πλ which is “at-
tached to” an elliptic coadjoint orbit Oλ := Ad∗ (G)λ, in the orbit philosophy due
618                                    T. Kobayashi

to Kirillov-Kostant. This representation is a unitarization of a Zuckerman-Vogan
module Aq (λ) after some ρ-shift, and can be realized in the Dolbeault cohomol-
ogy group on Oλ by the results of Schmid and Wong. (Here, we adopt the same
polarization and normalization as in a survey [Ko4 , §2], for the geometric quan-
tization Oλ ⇒ πλ .) We note that πλ ∈ G    b for “most” λ. Let g = k + p be the
complexification of a Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra g0 of G. We set
                                                                 √
               ∆+
                λ (p) := {α ∈ ∆(p, t) : hλ, αi > 0},   for λ ∈    −1t∗0 .

The original proof (see [Ko5 ]) of the next theorem was based on an algebraic method
without using microlocal analysis. Theorem B gives a simple and alternative proof.
                             b be attached to an elliptic coadjoint orbit Oλ . If
Theorem C ([Ko5 ]). Let πλ ∈ G

                          R -span ∆+             ′
                                   λ (p) ∩ Cone(G ) = {0},                       (2.2)

then the restriction πλ |G′ is G′ -admissible.
     Let us illustrate Theorem C in Examples 2.6 and 2.7 for non-compact G′ .
For this, we note that a maximal compact subgroup K is sometimes of the form
K1 × K2 (locally). This is the case if G/K is a Hermitian symmetric space (e.g.
G = Sp(n, R), SO∗ (2n), SU (p, q)). It is also the case if G = O(p, q), Sp(p, q), etc.
Example 2.6 (K ≃ K1 × K2 ). Suppose K is (locally) isomorphic to the direct
product group K1 × K2 . Then, the restriction πλ |G′ is G′ -admissible if λ|t∩k2 = 0
and G′ ⊃ K1 . So does the restriction π|G′ if π is any subquotient of a coherent
continuation of πλ . This case was a prototype of G′ -admissible restrictions π|G′
(where G′ is non-compact and π is a non-highest weight module) proved in 1989 by
the author ([Ko1 ; Ko2 , Proposition 4.1.3]), and was later generalized to Theorems B
and C. Special cases include:
 (1) K1 ≃ T, then π is a unitary highest weight module. The admissibility of
     the restrictions π|G′ in this case had been already known in ’70s (see Martens
     [Mt], Jakobsen-Vergne [J-Vr]).
 (2) K1 ≃ SU (2), then πλ is a quaternionic discrete series. Admissible restrictions
     π|G′ in this case are especially studied by Gross and Wallach [Gr-W1 ] in ’90s.
 (3) K1 ≃ O(q), U (q), Sp(q). Explicit branching laws of the restriction πλ |G′ for
     singular λ are given in [Ko3 , Part I] with respect to the vertical inclusions of
     the diagram below (see also [Ko1 , Ko5 ] for those to horizontal inclusions).

             O(4p, 4q)           ⊃        U (2p, 2q)       ⊃         Sp(p, q)
               ∪                           ∪                            ∪
        O(4r) × O(4p − 4r, 4q) ⊃ U (2r) × U (2p − 2r, 2q) ⊃ Sp(r) × Sp(p − r, q)

Example 2.7 (conformal group). There are 18 series of irreducible unitary rep-
resentations of G := U (2, 2) with regular integral infinitesimal characters. Among
them, 12 series (about “67% ” !) are G′ -admissible when restricted to G′ := Sp(1, 1).
    The assumption in Theorem B is in fact necessary. By using the technique of
symplectic geometry, the author proved the converse statement of Theorem B:
                                                                           b
Theorem D ([Ko13 ]). Let G ⊃ G′ be a pair of reductive Lie groups, and π ∈ G.
                             ′                        ′
If the restriction π|K ′ is K -admissible, then Cone(G ) ∩ ASK (π) = {0}.

3. Infinitesimal discrete decomposability
     The definition of admissible restrictions (Definition 2.1) is “analytic”, namely,
based on the direct integral decomposition (1.1) of unitary representations. Next,
we consider discrete decomposable restrictions by a purely algebraic approach.
Definition 3.1 ([Ko9 , Definition 1.1]). Let g be a Lie algebra. We say a g-module
X is discretely decomposable if there is an increasing sequence of g-submodules
of finite length:
                           ∞
                           [
                    X=         Xm , X0 ⊂ X1 ⊂ X2 ⊂ · · · .                   (3.1)
                                m=0

We note that dim Xm = ∞ in most cases below.
     Next, consider the restriction of group representations.
Definition 3.2. Let G ⊃ G′ be a pair of reductive Lie groups, and π ∈ G.b We
say that the restriction π|G′ is infinitesimally discretely decomposable if the
underlying (g, K)-module πK is discretely decomposable as a g′ -module.
     The terminology “discretely decomposable” is named after the following fact:
Theorem E ([Ko9 ]). Let (G, G′ ) be a pair of reductive Lie groups, and πK the
                                 b Then (i) and (ii) are equivalent:
underlying (g, K)-module of π ∈ G.
  i) The restriction π|G′ is infinitesimally discretely decomposable.
 ii) The (g, K)-module πK has a discrete branching law in the sense that πK
     is isomorphic to an algebraic direct sum of irreducible (g′ , K ′ )-modules.
     Moreover, the following theorem holds:
Theorem F (infinitesimal ⇒ Hilbert space decomposition; [Ko11 ]). Let
π ∈ G.b If the restriction π|G′ is infinitesimally discretely decomposable, then the
restriction π|G′ decomposes without continuous spectrum:
                   X⊕
          π|G′ ≃           mπ (τ )τ   (a discrete direct sum of Hilbert spaces).   (3.2)
                      c′
                   τ ∈G



     At this stage, the multiplicity mπ (τ ) := dim HomG′ (τ, π|G′ ) can be infinite.
620                                    T. Kobayashi

       However, for a reductive symmetric pair (G, G′ ), it is likely that the multiplic-
 ity of discrete spectrum is finite under the following assumptions, respectively.
(3.3) π is a discrete series representation for G.
(3.4) The restriction π|G′ is infinitesimally discretely decomposable.
                                                       c′ if (3.3) holds.
Conjecture 3.3 (Wallach, [X]). mπ (τ ) < ∞ for any τ ∈ G
                                                                c′ if (3.4) holds.
Conjecture 3.4 ([Ko11 , Conjecture C]). mπ (τ ) < ∞ for any τ ∈ G
     We note that Conjecture 3.4 for compact G′ corresponds to Harish-Chandra’s
admissibility theorem. A first affirmative result for general non-compact G′ was
given in [Ko9 ], which asserts that Conjecture 3.4 holds if π is attached to an elliptic
coadjoint orbit. A special case of this assertion is:
                                            c′ if both (3.3) and (3.4) hold.
Theorem G ([Ko9 ]). mπ (τ ) < ∞ for any τ ∈ G
     In particular, Wallach’s Conjecture 3.3 holds in the discretely decomposable
case. We note that an analogous finite-multiplicity statement fails if continuous
spectrum occurs in the restriction π|G′ for a reductive symmetric pair (G, G′ ):
Counter Example 3.5 ([Ko11 ]). mπ (τ ) can be ∞ if neither (3.3) nor (3.4) holds.
      Recently, I was informed by Huang and Vogan that they proved Conjecture 3.4
for any π [Hu-Vo].
      A key step of Theorem G is to deduce the K ′ -admissibility of the restriction
π|K ′ from the discreteness assumption (3.4), for which we employ Theorem H be-
low. Let us explain it briefly. We write Vg (π) for the associated variety of the
underlying (g, K)-module of π (see [Vo]), which is an algebraic variety contained in
the nilpotent cone of g∗ . Let prg→g′ : g∗ → (g′ )∗ be the projection corresponding
to g′ ⊂ g. Here is a necessary condition for infinitesimal discrete decomposability:
Theorem H (criterion for discrete decomposability [Ko9 , Corollary 3.4]). Let
    b If the restriction π|G′ is infinitesimally discretely decomposable, then
π ∈ G.
prg→g′ (Vg (π)) is contained in the nilpotent cone of (g′ )∗ .
      We end this section with a useful information on irreducible summands.
Theorem I (size of irreducible summands, [Ko9 ]). Let π ∈ G.        b If the restric-
tion π|G′ is infinitesimally discretely decomposable, then any irreducible summand
has the same associated variety, especially, the same Gelfand-Kirillov dimension.
      Here is a special case of Theorem I:
Example 3.6 (highest weight modules, [N-Oc-T]). Let G be the metaplectic group,
and G′ = G′1 G′2 is a dual pair with G′1 compact. Let θ(σ) be an irreducible unitary

     An analogous statement to Theorem I fails if there exists continuous spectrum
in the branching law π|G′ (see [Ko11 ] for counter examples).

4. Applications to representation theory
     So far, we have explained basic theory of discretely decomposable restrictions
of unitary representations for reductive Lie groups G ⊃ G′ . Now, we ask what
discrete decomposability can do for representation theory. Let us clarify advantages
of admissible restrictions, from which the following applications (and some more)
have been brought out and seem to be promising furthermore.
  1) Study of G c′ as irreducible summands of π|G′ .
  2) Study of G b by means of the restrictions to subgroups G′ .
  3) Branching laws of their own right.

4.1. From the view point of the study of G     c′ (smaller group), one of advantages of
admissible restrictions is that each irreducible summand of the branching law π|G′
gives an explicit construction of an element of G   c′ .
      Historically, an early success of this idea (in ’70s and ’80s) was the construction
of irreducible highest weight modules (Howe, Kashiwara-Vergne, Adams, · · · ). A
large part of these modules can be constructed as irreducible summands of discrete
branching laws of the Weil representation (see Examples 2.3 (2) and 3.6).
      This idea works also for non-highest weight modules. As one can observe from
the criterion in Theorem B, the restriction π|G′ tends to be discretely decomposable,
if ASK (π) is “small”. In particular, if π is a minimal representation in the sense
that its annihilator is the Joseph ideal, then a result of Vogan implies that ASK (π) is
one dimensional. Thus, there is a good possibility of finding subgroups G′ such that
π|G′ is G′ -admissible. This idea was used to construct “small” representations of
subgroups G′ by Gross-Wallach [Gr-W1 ]. In the same line, discretely decomposable
branching laws for non-compact G′ are used also in the theory of automorphic forms
for exceptional groups by J-S. Li [Li2 ].

4.2. From the view point of the study of G    b (larger group), one of advantages of
admissible restrictions is to give a clue to a detailed study of representations of G
by means of discrete branching laws.
      Needless to say, an early success in this direction is the theory of (g, K)-
modules (Lepowsky, Harish-Chandra, · · · ). The theory relies heavily on Harish-
Chandra’s admissibility theorem (Example 2.3 (1)) on the restriction of π to K.
      Instead of a maximal compact subgroup K, this idea applied to a non-compact
subgroup G′ still works, especially in the study of “small” representations of G. In
particular, this approach makes sense if the K-type structure is complicated but the
G′ -type structure is less complicated. Successful examples in this direction include:
  1) To determine an explicit condition on λ such that a Zuckerman-Vogan mod-
      ule Aq (λ) is non-zero, where we concern with the parameter λ outside the
      good range. In the setting of Example 2.6 (3), the author found in [Ko2 ] a
      combinatorial formula on K1 -types of Aq (λ) and determined explicitly when
      Aq (λ) 6= 0. The point here is that the computation of K-types of Aq (λ) is
      too complicated to carry out because a lot of cancellation occurs in the gener-
622                                  T. Kobayashi

    alized Blattner formula, while K1 -type formula (or G′ -type formula for some
    non-compact subgroup G′ ) behaves much simpler in this case.
  2) To study a fine structure of standard representations. For example, Lee
    and Loke [Le-Lo] determined the Jordan-Hölder series and the unitarizability
    of subquotients of certain degenerate non-unitary principal series representa-
    tions π, by using G′ -admissible restrictions for some non-compact reductive
    subgroup G′ . Their method works successfully even in the case where K-type
    multiplicity of π is not one.
4.3. From the view point of finding explicit branching law, an advantage of admis-
sible restrictions is that one can employ algebraic techniques because of the lack of
continuous spectrum. A number of explicit branching laws are newly found (e.g.
[D-Vs, Gr-W1,2 , Hu-P-S, Ko1,3,4,8 , Ko-Ø1,2 , Li2 , Lo1,2 , X]) in the context of ad-
missible restrictions to non-compact reductive subgroups. A mysterious feature is
that “different series” of irreducible representations may appear in discretely deco-
mopsable branching laws (see [Ko5 , p.184] for a precise meaning), although all of
them have the same Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions (Theorem I).

5. New discrete series for homogeneous spaces
     Let G ⊃ H be a pair of reductive Lie groups. Then, there is a G-invariant
Borel measure on the homogeneous space G/H, and one can define naturally a
unitary representation of G on the Hilbert space L2 (G/H).
                                                                             b
Definition 5.1. We say π is a discrete series representation for G/H, if π ∈ G
                                       2
is realized as a subrepresentation of L (G/H).
     A discrete series representation corresponds to a discrete spectrum in the
Plancherel formula for the homogeneous space G/H. One of basic problems in
non-commutative harmonic analysis is:
Problem 5.2. 1) Find a condition on the pair of groups (G, H) such that there
exists a discrete series representation for the homogeneous space G/H.
      2) If exist, construct discrete series representations.
     Even the first question has not found a final answer in the generality that
(G, H) is a pair of reductive Lie groups. Here are some known cases:
Example 5.3. Flensted-Jensen, Matsuki and Oshima proved in ’80s that discrete
series representations for a reductive symmetric space G/H exist if and only if

                           rank G/H = rank K/(H ∩ K).                            (5.1)

This is a generalization of Harish-Chandra’s condition, rank G = rank K, for a
group manifold G × G/ diag(G) ≃ G ([FJ, Mk-Os]).
     Our strategy to attack Problem 5.2 for more general (non-symmetric) homo-
geneous spaces G/H consists of two steps:
                Branching Problems of Unitary Representations                         623

  1) To embed G/H into a larger homogeneous space G/         e H, e on which harmonic
      analysis is well-understood (e.g. symmetric spaces).
  2) To take functions belonging to a discrete series representation H (֒→ L2 (G/  e H)),
                                                                                     e
      and to restrict them with respect to a submanifold G/H (֒→ G/H).    e  e
      If G/H is “generic”, namely, a principal orbit in G/ e H e in the sense of Richard-
son, then it is readily seen that discrete spectrum of the branching law π|G gives a
discrete series for G/H ([Ko10 , §8]; see also [Hu, Ko1,5 , Li1 ] for concrete examples).
      However, some other interesting homogeneous spaces G/H occur as non-
principal orbits on G/ e H,
                          e where the above strategy does not work in general. A
remedy for this is to impose the admissibility of the restriction of π, which
justifies the restriction of Lp -functions to submanifolds, and then gives rise to many
non-symmetric homogeneous spaces that admit discrete series representations. For
example, let us consider the case where G = G     eτ and H = G   e σ for commuting invo-
                                       e            e e
lutive automorphisms τ and σ of G such that G/H satisfies (5.1). Then by using
Theorem C and an asymptotic estimate of invariant measures [Ko6 ], we have:
Theorem J (discrete series for non-symmetric spaces, [Ko10 ]). Assume that
there is w ∈ Wσ such that
                                        √
                    R+ -span ∆+ (p)σ,w ∩ −1(t∗0 )−τ = {0}.           (5.2)
Then there exist infinitely many discrete series representations for any homogeneous
space of G that goes through xH e ∈ G/
                                     e He for any x ∈ K.e

     We refer to [Ko10 , Theorem 5.1] for definitions of a finite group Wσ and
∆+ (p)σ,w . The point here is that the condition (5.2) can be easily checked.
     For instance, if G ≃ Sp(2n, R) ≃ G/  e H e (a group manifold), then Theorem J
implies that there exist discrete series on all homogeneous spaces of the form:
                                                                      X
  G/H = Sp(2n, R)/(Sp(n0 , C) × GL(n1 , C) × · · · × GL(nk , C)), (       ni = n).

The choice of x in Theorem J corresponds to the partition (n0 , n1 , . . . , nk ). We note
that the above G/H is a symmetric space if and only if n1 = n2 = · · · = nk = 0.
     The restriction of unitary representations gives new methods even for sym-
metric spaces where harmonic analysis has a long history of research. Let us state
two results that are proved by the theory of discretely decomposable restrictions.
Theorem K (holomorphic discrete series for symmetric spaces). Suppose
G/H is a non-compact irreducible symmetric space. Then (i) and (ii) are equivalent:
  i) There exist unitary highest weight representations of G that can be realized as
     subrepresentations of L2 (G/H).
 ii) G/K is Hermitian symmetric and H/(H ∩ K) is its totally real submanifold.
     This theorem in the group manifold case is a restatement of Harish-Chandra’s
well-known result. The implication (ii) ⇒ (i) was previously obtained by a different
geometric approach (’Olafsson-Ørsted [Ol-Ø]). Our proof uses a general theory of
discretely decomposable restrictions, especially, Theorems B, H and J.
624                                  T. Kobayashi

Theorem L (exclusive law of discrete spectrum for restriction and induc-
tion). Let G/G′ be a non-compact irreducible symmetric space, and π ∈ G.  b Then
both (1) and (2) cannot occur simultaneously.
  1) The restriction π|G′ is infinitesimally discretely decomposable.
  2) π is a discrete series representation for the homogeneous space G/G′ .
     We illustrate Theorems K and L by G = SL(2, R). The examples below are
well-known results on harmonic analysis, however, the point is that they can be
proved by a simple idea coming from restrictions of unitary representations.
Example 5.4. 1) Holomorphic discrete series exist for G/H = SL(2, R)/SO(1, 1)
(a hyperboloid of one sheet). This is explained by Theorem K because the geodesic
H/(H ∩ K) is obviously totally real in the Poincaré disk G/K = SL(2, R)/SO(2).
2) There is no discrete series for the Poincaré disk G/K = SL(2, R)/SO(2). This
fact is explained by Theorem L because any representation of G is obviously dis-
cretely decomposable when restricted to a compact K.

6. Modular varieties, vanishing theorem
      Retain the setting as in Definition 2.2. Let Γ′ ⊂ Γ be cocompact torsion-free
discrete subgroups of G′ ⊂ G, respectively. For simplicity, let G′ be a semisim-
ple Lie group without compact factors. Then, both of the double cosets X :=
Γ\G/K and Y := Γ′ \G′ /K ′ are compact, orientable, locally Riemannian symmet-
ric spaces. Then, the inclusion G′ ֒→ G induces a natural map ι : Y → X. The
image ι(Y ) defines a totally geodesic submanifold in X. Consider the induced ho-
momorphism of the homology groups of degree m := dim Y ,

                            ι∗ : Hm (Y ; Z) → Hm (X; Z).

The modular symbol is defined to be the image ι∗ [Y ] ∈ Hm (X; Z) of the funda-
mental class [Y ] ∈ Hm (Y ; Z). Though its definition is simple, the understanding of
modular symbols is highly non-trivial.
      Let us first recall some results of Matsushima-Murakami and Borel-Wallach
on the de Rham cohomology group H ∗ (X; C) summarized as:
               M
 H ∗ (X; C) =       H ∗ (X)π , H ∗ (X)π := HomG (π, L2 (Γ\G))⊗ H ∗ (g, K; πK ). (6.1)
                b
              π∈G

The above result describes the topology of a single X by means of representation
theory. For the topology of the pair (Y, X), we need restrictions of representations:
Theorem M (vanishing theorem for modular symbols, [Ko-Od]). If

                       ASK (π) ∩ Cone(G′ ) = {0},     π 6= 1,

then the modular symbol ι∗ [Y ] is annihilated by the π-component H m (X)π in the
perfect paring H m (X; C) × Hm (X; C) → C.
                Branching Problems of Unitary Representations                    625

      Theorem M determines, for example, the middle Hodge components of totally
real modular symbols of compact Clifford-Klein forms of type IV domains.
      The discreteness of irreducible decompositions plays a crucial role both in
Matsushima-Murakami’s formula (6.1) and in a vanishing theorem for modular va-
rieties (Theorem M). In the former L2 (Γ\G) is G-admissible (Gelfand and Piateski-
Shapiro), while the restriction π|G′ is G′ -admissible (cf. Theorem B) in the latter.
