                                                 Abstract. Harmonic analysis on noncompact Riemannian symmetric spaces is in
                                                 a sense equivalent to the theory of the horospherical transform. There are no horo-
                                                 spheres on compact symmetric spaces, but we define a complex version of horospher-
                                                 ical transform which plays a similar role for the harmonic analysis on them.




                                                In the horospherical transform we integrate test functions along horospheres or,
                                            in other words, we integrate these functions with δ-functions with supports on
                                            horospheres. The idea of the complex horospherical transform [Gi00] is to replace
                                            the δ-function by the Cauchy kernel: more precisely, we take Cauchy kernels with
                                            singularities along complex horospheres without real points. Such a transform
                                            can work when the real transform either does not exist or has too big a kernel
                                            [Gi00, Gi01, Gi04]. We define such a transform here on compact symmetric spaces.
                                            Earlier we saw [Gi04] that it already gives a new interesting integral transform for
                                            the sphere S n .
                                                Let X = G/K be a compact Riemannian symmetric space; G here is a simply
                                            connected compact semisimple Lie group; K is its connected involutive subgroup.
                                            Let g = k + n be the corresponding involutive decomposition in the Lie algebras.
                                            Let Xn = Gn /K be the dual noncompact Riemannian symmetric space and gn =
                                            k + in be the corresponding decomposition in Lie algebras. Let a be a Cartan
                                            subspace in in, Σ+ be a system of positive (restricted) roots; (β1 , . . . βl ) be a basis
                                            of unmultipliable roots and (µ1 , . . . , µl ) be the dual system of fundamental weights

                                            ( hβji ,βjj i = δij ). Then

                                                                     Λ = {µ = λ1 µ1 + · · · + λl ; λj ∈ Z+ }

                                            is the set of highest (restricted) weights of spherical representations corresponding
                                            to the symmetric space X.
                                                Let A = exp(a), AI = exp(ia) be the corresponding commutative subgroups in
                                            Gn , G correspondingly. Let Gn = KAN be the Iwasawa decomposition, where N
                                            is the maximal unipotent subgroup in G. Let G0C = KC AC NC be the holomorphic
                                            complexification of this decomposition in GC . For a group H we denote through
                                            HC its complexification. The set G0C is a Zariski open set in GC . Let us consider
                                            the projection a(g) of G0C on the factor AC . We can consider this function also as
                                            a function on the symmetric Stein space XC = GC /KC .

For noncompact symmetric spaces Xn zonal spherical functions can be obtained by
the averaging of a(x)µ along K-orbits (Harish-Chandra’s integral representation).
Clerc [Cl88] suggested in the case of compact symmetric spaces X, using the pos-
sibility of the holomorphic extension of zonal spherical functions on XC , to write
the analogue of Harish-Chandra representation on XC . This representation can be
restricted on the compact group G and the compact space X but there is involved
the complex function aµ (x). For the zonal spherical function φµ (x) with the center
at the point x0 ∈ X (corresponding to a fixed isotropy subgroup K) we have
                                     Z
                       φµ (x; x0 ) =   aµ (xk)ν(dk), x ∈ XC
                                       K

where we integrate on the invariant measure on K. Here and everywhere below we
integrate on a compact homogeneous
                             R         manifold Y on the invariant measure ν(dy)
normalized by the condition Y ν(dy) = 1. The integrand is well-defined for almost
all k ∈ K. Clerc used this representations for the computation of the asymptotic
of zonal spherical functions on compact symmetric spaces similar to the famous
Harish-Chandra’s computation for noncompact spaces. The construction of the
complex horospherical transform on X in this note continues this application of
complex geometry to the harmonic analysis on compact symmetric spaces.
   The functions aµ (x), x ∈ XC , are elements of eigen subspaces of the invariant
differential operators which are NC -invariant. They sometimes are called zonal
horospherical functions. Let us extend them for different choices of A, N . Let

                         hµ (x, g) = aµ (xg), x ∈ XC , g ∈ GC .

This function will not change under right multiplications on elements of NC as
well as on elements of MC (as usual, M is the centralizer of A in K). Let Ξ =
GC /MC NC . We will realize its points as classes ζ = (gMC NC ). Then the function
hµ will depend only on the class ζ(g) ∈ Ξ. Correspondingly, we will denote it as
hµ (x, ζ), x ∈ XC , ζ ∈ Ξ.
   We will call Ξ the horospherical manifold. This name is connected with the
possibility to realize points of Ξ as the horospheres on XC : nondegenerate orbits of
the subgroup NC and its GC -translations.
   Let F = GC /PC = GC /MC AC NC ∼      = G/M A be the corresponding flag manifold.
There is a natural fibering Ξ → F with fibers AC . The group GC acts on Ξ by the
”left multiplications” (ζ 7→ g · ζ) and AC by the ”right multiplications” (ζ 7→ ζ · a))
and these actions commutate. The existence of the right action of AC is a crucial
circumstance for the horospherical transform. We have

                  hµ (x, ζ · a) = aµ hµ (x, ζ), x ∈ XC , ζ ∈ Ξ, a ∈ AC .

Choosing an initial point ζ0 we can parameterize points ζ ∈ Ξ as pairs ζ = (a, u), a ∈
AC , u ∈ F such that the right multiplications on elements of AC act on the a-
components of ζ = (a, u). We can define the horospheres Ω(ζ), ζ ∈ Ξ, on XC by
the equations
                              hj (·, ζ) = 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ l,
HOROSPHERICAL CAUCHY-RADON TRANSFORM ON COMPACT SYMMETRIC SPACES3

where hj = hµj . Of course, then hµ (x, ζ) = 1 for all µ.
  We have on X [Cl88,Corollary, p.427]:

                                 |aj (x)| ≥ 1, 1 ≥ j ≤ l

and the conditions |aj (x)| = 1 distinguish the image of the subgroup AI in X
(aj (x) = 1 for the initial point x0 ). Let A+ be the semigroup {|aj | < 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ l}
in AC and we define the domain Ξ+ in Ξ as {ζ = (a, u); a ∈ A+ } (the (G · ζ0 · A+ )-
orbit of the initial point ζ0 ). So the domain Ξ+ is fibering over the flag domain F
with the fibers A+ . We can reformulate the definition of Ξ+ :

                   Ξ+ = {ζ ∈ Ξ; hj (x, ζ) < 1 for all x ∈ X and j}.

   In other words, the domain Ξ+ parameterizes horospheres Ω(ζ) on XC with-
out real points (they do not intersect X). The points of the boundary ζ ∈ ∂Ξ+
correspond to the horospheres which intersect X in one point. It means that the
boundary admits the fibering over the symmetric space X with the fiber Ξ(x) over
x ∈ X defined by the equations

                                 hj (x, ζ) = 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ l,

(or a(x · ζ) = e). The fiber Ξx parameterizes the horospheres which intersect X in
the point x. The fibers are isomorphic to K/M .
   Now we are ready to give the basic definition. For f ∈ C ∞ (X) we define its
horospherical Cauchy-Radon transform as
                             Z
                                         f (x)
                   fˆ(ζ) =       Q                       ν(dx), ζ ∈ Ξ+ .
                             X    1≤j≤l (1  − hj (x, ζ))

For ζ ∈ Ξ+ the integrand has no singularities on X and is holomorphic on ζ. Hence
the function fˆ is holomorphic in the domain Ξ+ . The singular set of the integrand
on XC has a very simple structure and has as the edge exactly the horosphere Ω(ζ).
For ζ ∈ ∂Ξ+ the integral exists in the distribution sense and gives the regular
boundary values of fˆ.
   As usual in integral geometry, the principal problem is the problem of the inver-
sion of this horospherical transform. Let Dj be the partial logarithmic derivative
in the direction of the basic root βj on AC and its transfer on Ξ relative to the right
multiplications on AC . Then Dj hµ (x, ζ) = µj hµ (x, ζ). Let for any root α ∈ Σ+ :

where ρ is the half-sum of the positive roots and
                                           Y
                                      L=          D(α).

Theorem. There is an inversion formula for the horospherical Cauchy-Radon
transform
                                Z
                        f (x) =     Lfˆ(ζ)ν(dζ).
                                       Ξ(x)


   Here we integrate the boundary values of the holomorphic function fˆ over the
normalized invariant measure on K/M .
   This result is a simple corollary of the Plancherel formula on compact symmetric
spaces [Sh77,H94]. We define the spherical Fourier transform in ”complex” form:
                              Z
                    ˜
                   f (ζ; µ) =    f (x)hµ (x, ζ)ν(dx), µ ∈ Λ, ζ ∈ Ξ.
                             X


The function f˜(ζ; µ) is holomorphic on ζ ∈ Ξ and satisfies the condition of homo-
geneity:
                              fˆ(ζ · a; µ) = aµ (fˆ(ζ; µ).
In other words, f˜(ζ; µ) is the section of the line bundle on F corresponding to µ.
So we have maps in the spaces of irreducible spherical representations in the flag
realization.
   Similarly, to noncompact symmetric spaces, the spherical Fourier transform and
horospherical Cauchy-Radon transform are connected by the commutative Fourier
transform, this time, by the discrete one. Since the right multiplications on elements
a ∈ AC (ζ 7→ ζ · a) commutate with the action of G we can decompose fˆ(ζ) in the
Fourier series relative to this action of Abelian compact group AI . The components
(which are invariant relative to the action of G) are just f˜(ζ; µ):
                                           X
                                   fˆ(ζ) =     f˜(ζ; µ).
                                        µ∈Λ

It is the result of the direct decomposition the kernel in the definition of the horo-
spherical transform. The inversion formula for the spherical Fourier transforms
equivalent to the Plancherel formula on X is
                                   X      Z
                           f (x) =   d(µ)      f˜(ζ; µ)ν(dζ),
                                 µ∈Λ          Ξ(x)


where for the dimension we have Weyl’s formula
                                       Y hµ + ρ, αi
                              d(µ) =                .
                                           hρ, αi
                                       α∈Σ+


It follows from the inversion formula on X [Sh77,H94] since
                     Z                      Z
                           f˜(ζ, µ)ν(d(ζ) =   f (y)φ(y; x)ν(dy).
                      Ξ(x)                     X


Here φ(·, x) is the zonal spherical function with the center x and it follows from
Clerk’s representation for zonal spherical functions. Now the inversion formula is
HOROSPHERICAL CAUCHY-RADON TRANSFORM ON COMPACT SYMMETRIC SPACES5

the consequence of the fact that the multiplication of the Fourier coefficients on the
polynomial d(µ) corresponds to the action of the differential operator L.
   In this note we obtain the results on horospherical transform as a reformulation
of known facts of the harmonic analysis on compact symmetric spaces. Our aim
here is to emphasize that formulas which we receive for the complex horospherical
transform on compact symmetric spaces are completely similar to the formulas for
the horospherical transform on noncompact Riemannian symmetric spaces. In our
next publication we will obtain them by direct methods of integral geometry and
it gives a new approach to harmonic analysis on compact homogeneous manifolds.
   Let us consider a simplest example when X is the sphere S n ⊂ Rn+1 [Gi04]:

                     ∆(x) = x · x = (x1 )2 + · · · + (xn+1 )2 = 1.

Let CS n be its complexification defined in Cn+1 by the equation ∆(z) = 1. Then
Ξ can be realize as the cone

                              ∆(ζ) = 0, ζ ∈ Cn+1 , ζ 6= 0,

and the flag manifold F as its projectivization in P Cn . The horospheres Ω(ζ), ζ ∈ Ξ,
can be defined as the intersection of S n by the isotropic hyperplanes

                          ζ · z = ζ1 z1 + · · · + ζn+1 zn+1 = 1.

The parameters ζ of horospheres without real points give the domain Ξ+ :

                            ∆(ξ) = ∆(η) < 1, ζ = ξ + iη.

The fibers Ξ(x) in the fibering of ∂Ξ+ over S n are {ζ = x + iη, x · η = 0, η · η =
1}. Finally the differential operator in the inversion formula is L = (1 + cD)n−1 ,
where D is the logarithmic differentiation along generators in the cone Ξ and c is
a normalized constant.
Remarks. 1.The domain Ξ covers the compact complex manifold F . On F all holo-
morphic functions are constant, but on Ξ+ there is a lot of holomorphic functions
(they separate points of Ξ+ . The domain Ξ+ is not holomorphically complete since
Ξ does not have this property. The extension reduces to the extension of the fibers
AC . If F = CP n and z0 , . . . , zn are homogeneous coordinates, then Ξ+ is the com-
plex ball without the point: 1 > |z0 |2 +· · ·+|zn |2 > 0 and all holomorphic functions
in Ξ+ extend on the ball. In the example of the sphere, which we considered earlier,
the natural extension of Ξ+ has the singularity.
   It is simple to construct a Hardy type norm in H(Ξ+ ) corresponding to the
action of A+ and then we will have the model of spherical series of representations
for X.
   2. The horospherical transform and its inversion connect functions on real man-
ifold X and holomorphic functions in Ξ+ . The natural understanding of this situ-
                                                               ¯
ation lies in the consideration of hyperfunctions on X as ∂-cohomology        classes of
H (m) (XC \X), where m = n − l, n = dim X, l = rank X (the dimension of horo-
spheres). Then we can interpret the horospherical transform as a version of the
Penrose transform: we integrate cohomology along complex horospheres in XC \X.
A complication is that horospheres are not cycles and we need to be careful when
6                                  SIMON GINDIKIN

integrating cohomology. It would be interesting to define natural subspaces of co-
homology in XC \X and holomorphic functions in Ξ+ which can be intertwined.
Intermediate Paley-Wiener theorems can be also interesting.
   To receive the cohomological interpretation of the inverse horospherical trans-
                                                          ¯
form we need to appeal to holomorphic language for ∂-cohomology          from [EGW95].
For each u ∈ F we take the union D(u) of ”parallel” horospheres parameterizing
by points in Ξ+ lying over u. We have the covering of XC \X by the Stein domains
D(u), u ∈ F . This covering satisfies the conditions from [EGW95] and we can con-
struct Dolbeault cohomology using the complex of holomorphic forms ϕ(z|u, du)
on F depending holomorphically on parameters z ∈ D(u). We can extend the
integrand in the inversion formula as such kind of a form.
   There is another possibility interesting from point of view of complex analysis:
to consider the horospherical Cauchy-Radon transform as the intertwining operator
between holomorphic functions on whole manifolds XC and Ξ. We will discuss this
operator in another paper.
   3.When we want to construct the inverse horospherical transform we seek an inte-
gral operator on the space of all in a sense functions on the manifold of horospheres.
In our case they are holomorphic functions. The restrictions of this operator on
subspaces of sections of line bundles on F , corresponding to irreducible representa-
tions, give eigen functions of invariant differential functions (spherical polynomials).
It is a Poisson’s type integral. For the sphere such formulas go back to Maxwell.
It would be interesting to deliberate the analogy with noncompact case. In a sense
the flag manifold F plays the role of the ”complex” boundary of X.
