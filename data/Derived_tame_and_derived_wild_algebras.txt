                                                This is a talk given by the author at the IV International Algebraic Con-
                                             ference in Ukraine (Lviv, August 2003). It is devoted to the notions of
                                             derived tameness and wildness of algebras and the recent progress in the
                                             topic. The main result, obtained by Viktor Bekkert and the author, is the
                                             tame-wild dichotomy for derived categories, which is an analogue of the au-
                                             thor’s theorem for algebras [5]. The proof is also very much alike that of [5];
                                             it relies on the technique of matrix problems (representations of boxes) and
                                             a reduction algorithm for matrices. The principal distinction is that here
                                             we have to consider non-free (even non-semi-free) boxes. Fortunately, the
                                             required class of boxes can be dealt with in a similar way; it is considered
                                             in Section 3 of this paper. Section 1 is devoted to the general notions re-
                                             lated to derived categories, derived tameness, etc., while Section 2 presents
                                             a transition to matrix problems. Further, we consider the results related to
                                             deformations and degenerations of derived tame and derived wild algebras
                                             obtained by the author [7]. Namely, in Section 4 we construct some “almost
                                             versal” families of complexes with projective bases, analogous to the families
                                             of modules constructed in [8]. It makes possible to introduce the “number
                                             of parameters” defining complexes of given rank and to prove (in Section 5)
                                             that this number is upper semi-continuous in flat families of algebras. As
                                             a corollary, we get that a deformation of a derived tame algebra is derived
                                             tame; respectively, a degeneration of a derived wild algebra is derived wild.

We also explain the situation that can arise if one considers families that
are non-flat (especially the example of Brüstle [2]).
   Since it is a survey, we sometimes only sketch proofs referring to the papers
[1, 7], though we try to give all necessary definitions, especially related to
derived categories and boxes.
   I am grateful to Viktor Bekkert and Igor Burban for fruitful collaboration
and useful discussions, which were of great influence in preparing this paper.
I am also thankful to Birge Huisgen-Zimmermann who inspired me to start
these investigations.

                            1. Derived categories
   In what follows we consider finite dimensional algebras over an alge-
braically closed field k. Let A be such an algebra. As usually, we write
⊗ and Hom instead of ⊗k and Homk ; we denote by V ∗ the dual vector
space Hom(V, k). All considered categories A are also supposed to be lin-
ear categories over the field k, which means that all sets A(a, b) are vector
spaces over k and the multiplication of morphisms is k-bilinear. Recall that
the derived category D(A) of (finite dimensional) A-modules is defined as
follows [13, 14]. First consider the category of complexes C(A). Its ob-
jects are sequences M• = (Mn , dn ) of finite dimensional modules and their
homomorphisms
                 dn+2             dn+1           d              dn−1
(1)       . . . −−−−→ Mn+1 −−−−→ Mn −−−n−→ Mn−1 −−−−→ . . .
such that dn+1 dn = 0 for all n. A morphism φ• = (φn ) of a complex (1) to
another complex M•′ = (Mn′ , d′n ) is a commutative diagram
                 dn+2             dn+1           d              dn−1
            . . . −−−−→ Mn+1 −−−−→ Mn −−−n−→ Mn−1 −−−−→ . . .
                                               
                                               
(2)                    φn+1 y     φn y      φn−1 y

                 d′n+2            d′n+1          d′             d′n−1
                         ′
            . . . −−−−→ Mn+1 −−−−→ Mn′ −−−n−→ Mn−1
                                               ′   −−−−→ . . .
One says that such a morphism is homotopic to zero if there are homomor-
phisms σn : Mn → Mn+1  ′   (n ∈ N) such that φn = σn−1 dn + d′n+1 σn for all n.
The factor category H(A) of C(A) modulo the ideal of morphisms homotopic
to zero is called the homotopic category of A-modules. For each n the n-th
homology of a complex (1) is defined as Hn (M• ) = Ker dn / Im dn+1 . Obvi-
ously, a morphism φ• of complexes induces homomorphisms of homologies
Hn (φ• ) : Hn (M• ) → Hn (M•′ ), and if φ• is homotopic to zero, it induces zero
homomorphisms of homologies. Hence, Hn can be considered as functors
H(A) → vec, the category of (finite dimensional) vector spaces. One call a
morphism φ• from C(A) or from H(A) quasi-isomorphism if all Hn (φ• ) are
isomorphisms. Now the derived category D(A) is defined as the category of
fractions H(A)[Q−1 ], where Q is the set of all quasi-isomorphisms.
   One calls a complex (1) right bounded (left bounded, bounded) if there
is n0 such that Mn = 0 for n < n0 (respectively, there is n1 such that
Mn = 0 for n > n1 , or there are both). The corresponding categories are
denoted by C − , H− , D − (respectively, by C + , H+ , D + , or by C b , Hb , D b ). In
this paper we mainly deal with the bounded derived category D b (A). The
category A-mod of (finite dimensional) A-modules naturally embeds into
               DERIVED TAME AND DERIVED WILD ALGEBRAS                         3


D(A) (even in D b (A)): a module M is identified with the complex M• such
that M0 = M, Mn = 0 for n 6= 0.
    Since the category of modules has enough projectives, one can replace,
when considering right bounded homotopic or derived category, arbitrary
complexes by projective ones, i.e. consisting of projective modules only.
We denote by P − (A) and by P b (A) the categories of right bounded and
bounded projective complexes. Actually, D − (A) ≃ H− (A) ≃ P − (A)/Ih ,
where Ih is the ideal of morphisms homotopic to zero [13, 14]. More-
over, in finite dimensional case every module M has a projective cover, i.e.
there is an epimorphism p(M ) : P (M ) → M , where P (M ) is projective,
such that Ker p(M ) ⊆ rad P (M ), the radical of P (M ) [9]. Therefore, one
can only consider minimal complexes, i.e. projective complexes such that
                                                 −
Im dn ⊆ rad Pn−1 for all n. We denote by Pmin       (A) the category of mini-
                                      −          −
mal projective complexes. Thus D (A) ≃ Pmin (A)/Ih . One immediately
checks that the image in D − (A) of a morphism φ• of minimal complexes
is an isomorphism if and only if φ itself is an isomorphism. Hence, if we
are interested in classification of objects from D − (A), we can replace it
       −
by Pmin   (A). Unfortunately, it is no more the case if we consider D b (A).
Certainly, if gl.dim A < ∞, one has that D b (A) ≃ Pmin  b (A)/I , since any
                                                                  h
bounded complex has a bounded projective resolution. On the contrary,
if gl.dim A = ∞, it is wrong even for modules. Nevertheless, we propose
the following approximation of D b (A), which is enough for classification
purpose. (Compare it with [16].)
    We denote by P m (A) the category of bounded projective complexes M•
such that Mn = 0 for n > m (note that the left bound is not prescribed).
We say that a morphism φ• in P m (A) is quasi-homotopic to zero if there
are homomorphisms σk : Mn → Mn+1    ′     such that φn = σn−1 dn + d′n+1 σn for
all n < m. Let Hm (A) = P m (A)/Iqh , where Iqh is the ideal of morphisms
quasi-homotopic to zero. Especially, if P• is a minimal complex from P m (A),
it is isomorphic in Hm (A) to a minimal complex P̃• such that P̃n = Pn , d˜n =
dn for n 6= m, while Pm = P̃m ⊕ Q so that Q ⊆ Ker dm , d˜m = dm |P̃m and
Ker d˜m ⊆ rad P̃m . There is a natural functor Hm (A) → Hm+1 (A), which
maps a complex P• to the complex P•+ , where Pn+ = Pn , d+  n = dn for n ≤ m,
         +
while Pm+1   = P (Ker dm ) and d+
                                m+1   is the epimorphism  p(Ker         +
                                                                dm ) : Pm+1  →
Ker dm . Conversely, there is a functor H     m+1           m
                                                  (A) → H (A), which just
abandon Pm+1 in a complex P• . One easily verifies the following results.

Proposition 1.1.      (1) D b (A) ≃ limm Hm (A);
                                    −→
   (2) D − (A) ≃ limm Hm (A).
                 ←−
  Moreover, if complexes P• and P•′ ∈ P m (A) are minimal, their images in
D (A) are isomorphic if and only if P̃• ≃ P̃•′ as complexes.
 b


  Thus dealing with classification problems, one can deal with Hm or with
Pm  instead of D b . Note also that if we fix all Hn (P• ) for a complex from
  m (A), there are finitely many possibilities for the values of P .
Pmin                                                               n
  Taking into consideration these remarks, one can define derived wild and
derived tame algebras as follows.

Definition 1.2.       (1) Let R be a k-algebra. A family of A-complexes
       based on R is a complex of finitely generated projective A ⊗ Rop -
       modules P• . We denote by P m (A, R) the category of all bounded
       families with Pn = 0 for n > m (again we do not prescribe the right
       bound). For such a family P• and an R-module L we denote by
       P• (L) the complex (Pn ⊗R L, dn ⊗ 1). If L is finite dimensional,
       P• (L) ∈ P m (A).
   (2) We call a family P• strict if for every finite dimensional R-modules
       L, L′
        (a) P• (L) ≃ P• (L′ ) if and only if L ≃ L′ ;
        (b) P• (L) is indecomposable if and only if so is L.
   (3) We call A derived wild if it has a strict family of complexes over
       every finitely generated k-algebra R.
    The following fact is well known.
Proposition 1.3. An algebra A is derived wild if and only if it has a strict
family over one of the following algebras:
   (1) free algebra khx, yi in two variables;
   (2) polynomial algebra k[x, y] in two variables;
   (3) power series algebra k[[x, y]] in two variables.
   Let A1 , A2 , . . . , As be a set of representatives of isomorphism classes of
indecomposable projective Pm       A-modules. (For instance, one can choose a de-
composition 1 = i=1 ei , where ei are primitive orthogonal idempotents,
take e1 , e2 , . . . , es all pairwise non-conjugate of them, and set Ai = Aei .)
LP
If
   s
      is an arbitrary projective A-module, it uniquely decomposes as P ≃
   i=1 ri Ai . Set r(P ) = (r1 , r2 , . . . , rs ) and call it the vector rank of P . For
a projective complex P• set r• (P• ) = (r(Pn ) | n ∈ Z). Given an arbitrary
sequence v• = (vn | n ∈ Z) denote by P(v• , A) the set of complexes P• such
that r• (P• ) = v• .
Definition 1.4.        (1) A rational algebra is a k-algebra k[t, f (t)−1 ] for a
       non-zero polynomial f (t). A rational family of A-complexes is a
       family over a rational algebra R.
   (2) For a rational family P• denote by r• (P• ) = r• (P• (L)) , where L is
       a one-dimensional R-module. (This value does not depend on the
       choice of L.)
   (3) An algebra A is called derived tame if there is a set of rational
       families of bounded A-complexes S such that:
        (a) for every (bounded) v• the set S(v• ) = { P• ∈ S | r• (P• ) = v• }
            is finite.
        (b) for every v• all indecomposable complexes from P(v• , A), ex-
            cept finitely many of them (up to isomorphism) are isomorphic
            to a complex P• (L) for some P• ∈ S and some finite dimen-
            sional L.
We call S a parameterising set of A-complexes.
   These definitions do not formally coincide with other definitions of derived
tame and derived wild algebras, for instance, those proposed in [11, 12], but
all of them are evidently equivalent. It is obvious (and easy to prove) that

neither algebra can be both derived tame and derived wild. The follow-
ing result (“tame-wild dichotomy for derived categories”) has recently been
proved by V. Bekkert and the author [1].
Theorem 1.5 (Main Theorem). Every finite dimensional algebra over an
algebraically closed field is either derived tame or derived wild.

                   2. Reduction to matrix problems
   We recall now the main notions related to the matrix problems (represen-
tations of boxes). More detailed exposition can be found in [6]. A box is a
pair A = (A, V), where A is a (k-linear) category and V is an A-coalgebra,
i.e. an A-bimodule supplied with comultiplication µ : V → V ⊗A V and
counit ι : V → A, which are homomorphisms of A-bimodules and satisfy
the usual coalgebra conditions
             (µ ⊗ 1)µ = (1 ⊗ µ)µ,      il (ι ⊗ 1)µ = ir (1 ⊗ ι)µ = id,
where il : A ⊗A V ≃ V and ir : V ⊗A A ≃ V are the natural isomorphisms.
The kernel V = Ker ι is called the kernel of the box. A representation of such
a box in a category C is a functor M : A → C. Given another representation
N : A → C, a morphism f : M → N is defined as a homomorphism of A-
modules V ⊗A M → N , or, equivalently, as a homomorphism of A-bimodules
V → HomC (M, N ), the latter supplied with the obvious A-bimodule struc-
ture. The composition gf of f : M → N and g : N → L is defined as the
composition
                     µ⊗1                      1⊗f                 g
        V ⊗A M −−−−→ V ⊗A V ⊗A M −−−−→ V ⊗A N −−−−→ L,
while the identity morphism idM of M is the composition
                                 ι⊗1                 i
                     V ⊗A M −−−−→ A ⊗A M −−−l−→ M.
Thus we obtain the category of representations Rep(A, C). If C = vec, we
just write Rep(A). If f is a morphism and γ ∈ V(a, b), we denote by f (γ)
the morphism f (b)(γ ⊗ ) : M (a) → N (a). A box A is called normal (or
group-like) if there is a set of elements ω = { ωa ∈ V(a, a) | a ∈ ob A } such
that ι(ωa ) = 1a and µ(ωa ) = ωa ⊗ ωa for every a ∈ ob A. In this case, if f is
an isomorphism, all morphisms f (ωa ) are isomorphisms M (a) ≃ N (a). This
set is called a section of A. For a normal box, one defines the differentials
∂0 : A → V and ∂1 : V → V ⊗A V setting
             ∂0 (α) = αωa − ωb α       for α ∈ A(a, b);
              ∂1 (γ) = µ(γ) − γ ⊗ ωa − ωb ⊗ γ       for γ ∈ V(a, b).
Usually we omit indices, writing ∂α and ∂γ.
   Recall that a free category kΓ, where Γ is an oriented graph, has the ver-
tices of Γ as its objects and the paths from a to b (a, b being two vertices) as a
basis of the vector space kΓ(a, b). A semi-free category is a category of frac-
tions kΓ[S −1 ], where S = { gα (α) | α runs through a set of loops } (called
the marked loops) of the graph Γ. The arrows of Γ are called the free (re-
spectively, semi-free) generators of the free (semi-free) category. A normal
box A = (A, V) is called free (semi-free) if such is the category A, moreover,
the kernel V = Ker ι of the box is a free A -bimodule and ∂α = 0 for each

marked loop α. A set of free (respectively, semi-free) generators of such a
box is a union S = S0 ∪ S1 , where S0 is a set of free (semi-free) generators of
the category A and S1 is a set of free generators of the A-bimodule V. A set
of free (or semi-free) generators S is called triangular if there is a function
̺ : S → N (we call it “weight”) such that, for every α ∈ S, the differential
∂α belongs to the sub-box generated by { β ∈ S | ̺(β) < ̺(α) }; especially, if
̺(α) = 0, α is minimal, i.e. ∂α = 0. A free (semi-free) box having a trian-
gular set of free (semi-free) generators is called triangular. For a triangular
box a morphism of representations f : M → N is an isomorphism if and
only if all f (ωa ) are isomorphisms. In what follows we always suppose that
our graphs are locally finite, i.e. only have finitely many arrows starting or
ending at a given vertex. If such a graph Γ has no oriented cycles, then the
category kΓ is locally finite dimensional, i.e. all its spaces of morphisms are
finite dimensional.
   We call a category A trivial if it is a free category generated by a trivial
graph (i.e. one with no arrows); thus A(a, b) = 0 if a 6= b and A(a, a) = k.
We call A minimal, if it is a semi-free category with a set of semi-free
generators consisting of loops only, at most one loop at each vertex. Thus
A(a, b) = 0 again if a 6= b, while A(a, a) is either k or a rational algebra.
We call a normal box A = (A, V) so-trivial if A is trivial, and so-minimal if
A is minimal and all its loops α are minimal too (i.e. with ∂α = 0).
   In [5] (cf. also [6]) the classification of representations of an arbitrary finite
dimensional algebra was reduced to representations of a free triangular box.
To deal with derived categories we have to consider a wider class of boxes.
First, a factor-box of a box A = (A, V) modulo an ideal I ⊆ A is defined
as the box A/I = (A/I, V/(IV + VI) (with obvious comultiplication and
counit). Note that if A is normal, so is A/I.
Definition 2.1. A sliced box is a factor-box A/I, where A = (A, V) is   S a free
box such that the set of its objects V = ob A is a disjoint union V = i∈Z Vi
such that A(a, b) = 0 if a ∈ Vi , b ∈ Vj with j > i, A(a, a) = k, and
V(a, b) = 0 if a ∈ Vi , b ∈ Vj with i 6= j. WeScall a sliced box A/I triangular
if so is the free box A. The partition V = i Vi is called a slicing.
   Certainly, in this definition we may assume that the elements of the ideal
I are linear combinations of paths of length at least 2. Otherwise such an
element is a linear combination of arrows, so we can just eliminate one of
these arrows from the underlying graph.
   Note that for every representation M ∈ Rep(A), where A is a free (semi-
free, sliced) box with the set of objects V, one can consider its dimension
Dim(M ), which is a function V → N, namely Dim(M )(a) = dim M (a).
We call such a representation finite dimensional if its support supp M =
{ a ∈ V | M (a) 6= 0 } is finite and denote by rep(A) the category of finite
dimensional representations. Having these notions, one can easily reproduce
the definitions of families of representations, especially strict families, wild
and tame boxes; see [5, 6] for details. The following procedure, mostly
modelling that of [5], let us replace derived categories by representations of
sliced boxes.
   Let A be a finite dimensional algebra, J be its radical. As far as we
are interested in A-modules and complexes, we can replace A by a Morita

equivalent reduced algebra, thus suppose that A/J ≃ ks [9]. Let 1 = si=1 ,
where ei are primitive orthogonal idempotents; set Aji = ej Aei and Jji =
ej Jei ; note that Jji = Aji if i 6= j. We denote by S the trivial category
with the set of objects { (i, n) | n ∈ N, i = 1, 2, . . . , s } and consider the S-
bimodule J such that
                                       (
                                        0     if m 6= n − 1,

                                         Jji if m = n − 1.
Let B = S[J ] be the tensor category of this bimodule; equivalently, it is the
free category having the same set of objects as S and the union of bases of
all J (i, n), (j, m) as a set of free generators. Denote by U the S-bimodule
such that                                (
                                          0     if n 6= m,

        f = B ⊗S U ⊗S B. Dualizing the multiplication Akj ⊗ Aji → Aki ,
and set W
we get homomorphisms
                                       f
                         λr :B → B ⊗S W,
                                       f ⊗S B,
                               λl :B → W
                                    f→W
                                µ̃ :W f ⊗S W.
                                           f

In particular, µ̃ defines on Wf a structure of B-coalgebra. Moreover, the
                                                           f i.e. µ̃(W0 ) ⊆
sub-bimodule W0 generated by Im(λr − λl ) is a coideal in W,
       f     f                            f
W0 ⊗B W ⊕ W ⊗B W0 . Therefore, W = W/W0 is also a B-coalgebra, so we
get a box B = (B, W). One easily checks that it is free and triangular.
   Dualizing multiplication also gives a mapping

                                       k=1
Namely, if we choose bases { α } , { β } { γ } in the spaces, respectively, Jji ,
Jjk , Jki , and dual bases { α∗ } , { β ∗ } , { γ ∗ } in their duals, then β ∗ ⊗ γ ∗
occurs in ν(α∗ ) with the same coefficient as α occurs in βγ. Note            that
the right-hand space in (3) coincide with each B (i, n), (j, n − 2) . Let I
be the ideal in B generated by the images of ν in all these spaces and
D = B/I = (A, V), where A = B/I, V = W/(IW + WI). If necessary, we
write D(A) to emphasise that this box has been constructed from a given
algebra A. Certainly, D is a sliced triangular box, and the following result
holds.

Thus the set { Mji (n) | i, j = 1, 2, . . . , s } defines a homomorphism dn : Pn →
Pn−1 and vice versa. Moreover, one easily verifies that the condition (4) is
equivalent to the relation
                       Ls dn dn+1 = 0. Since every projective A-module can
be given in the form i=1 Ai ⊗ Vi for some uniquely defined vector spaces
Vi , we get a one-to-one correspondence between finite dimensional represen-
tations of D and bounded minimal complexes of projective A-modules. In
the same way one also establishes one-to-one correspondence between mor-
phisms of representations and of the corresponding complexes, compatible
with their multiplication, which accomplishes the proof.                         
Corollary 2.3. An algebra A is derived tame (derived wild) if so is the box
D(A).

                     3. Proof of the main theorem
   Now we are able to prove the main theorem. Namely, according to Corol-
lary 2.3, it follows from the analogous result for sliced boxes.
Theorem 3.1. Every sliced triangular box is either tame or wild.
   Actually, just as in [5] (see also [6]), we shall prove this theorem in the
following form.
Theorem 3.1a. Suppose that a sliced triangular box A = (A, V) is not
wild. For every dimension d of its representations there is a functor Fd :
A → M, where M is a minimal category, such that every representation
M : A → vec of A of dimension Dim(M ) ≤ d is isomorphic to the inverse
image F ∗ N = N ◦ F for some functor N : M → vec. Moreover, F can be
                 DERIVED TAME AND DERIVED WILD ALGEBRAS                             9


chosen strict, which means that F ∗ N ≃ F ∗ N ′ implies N ≃ N ′ and F ∗ N is
indecomposable if so is N .
Remark. We can consider the induced box AF = (M, M ⊗A V ⊗A M). It
is a so-minimal box, and F ∗ defines a full and faithful functor rep(AF ) →
rep(A). Its image consists of all representations M : A → vec that factorise
through F .
Proof. As we only consider finite dimensional representations, we    S may as-
sume that the set of objects is finite.S    Hence the slicing V = i Vi (see
Definition 2.1) is finite too: V = m    i=1 i and we use induction by m. If
                                           V
m = 1, A is free, and our claim has been proved in [5]. So we may suppose
that the theorem is true for smaller values of m, especially, itSis true for the
restriction A′ = (A′ , V ′ ) of the box A onto the subset V′ = m  i=2 Vi . Thus
                              ′   ′
there is a strict functor F : A → M, where M is a minimal category, such
that every representation of A′ of dimension smaller than d is of the form
                                                                         F ′
F ′ ∗ N for N : M → vec. Consider now the amalgamation B = A A M
and the box B = (B, W), where W = B ⊗A V ⊗A B. The functor F ′ ex-
tends to a functor F : A → B and induces a homomorphism of A-bimodules
V → W; so it defines a functor F ∗ : rep(B) → rep(A), which is full and
faithful. Moreover, every representation of A of dimension smaller than d is
isomorphic to F ∗ N for some N , and all possible dimensions of such N are
restricted by some vector b. Therefore, it is enough to prove the claim of
the theorem for the box B.
    Note that the category B is generated by the loops from M and the images
of arrows from A(a, b) with b ∈ V1 (we call them new arrows). It implies
                                                                    P       that
all possible relations between these morphisms are of the form β βgβ (α),
where α ∈ B(a, a) is a loop (necessarily minimal, i.e. with ∂α = 0), gβ
are some polynomials, and β runs through the set of new arrows from a to
b forP some b ∈ V1 . Consider all of these relations for a fixed
                                                                   b; let them
be β βgβ,k (α). Their coefficients form a matrix gβ,k (α) . Making linear
transformations of the set { β } and of the set of relations, we can make
this matrix diagonal, i.e. make all relations being βfβ (α) = 0 for some
polynomials fβ . If one of fβ is zero, the box B has a sub-box
                                             β
                                    9a
                               α                    /b,

with ∂α = ∂β = 0, which is wild; hence B and A are also wild. Otherwise,
let f (α) 6= 0 be a common multiple of all fβ (α), Λ = { λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λr } be the
set of roots of f (α). If N ∈ rep(B) is such that N (α) has no eigenvalues
from Λ, then f (N (α)) is invertible; thus N (β) = 0 for all β : a → b. So
we can apply the reduction of the loop α with respect to the set Λ and the
dimension d = b(a), as in [5, Propositions 3,4] or [6, Theorem 6.4]. It gives a
new box that has the same number of loops as B, but the loop corresponding
to α is “isolated,” i.e. there are no more arrows starting or ending at the
same vertex. In the same way we are able to isolate all loops, obtaining a
semi-free triangular box C and a morphism G : B → C such that G∗ is full
and faithful and all representations of B of dimensions smaller than b are
of the form G∗ L. As the theorem is true for semi-free boxes, it accomplishes
the proof.                                                                          

Remark. Applying reduction functors, like in the proof above, we can also
extend to sliced boxes (thus to derived categories) other results obtained
before for free boxes. For instance, we mention the following theorem, quite
analogous to that of Crawley-Boevey [3].
Theorem 3.2. If an algebra A is derived tame, then, for any vector d =
(dn | n ∈ Z) such that almost all dn = 0, there is at most finite set of generic
A-complexes of endolength d, i.e. such indecomposable minimal bounded
complexes P• of projective A-modules, not all of which are finitely generated,
that lengthE (Pn ) = dn for all n, where E = EndA (P• ).
   Its proof reproduces again that of [3], with obvious changes necessary to
include sliced boxes into consideration.

                            4. Families of complexes
   We consider now algebraic families of A-complexes, i.e. flat families over
an algebraic variety X. Such a family is a complex F• = (Fn , dn ) of flat co-
herent A⊗OX -modules. We always assume this complex bounded and min-
imal; the latter means that Im dn ⊆ JFn−1 for all n, where J = rad A. We
also assume that X is connected; it implies that the vector rank r• (F• (x))
is constant, so we can call it the vector rank of the family F and denote
it by r• (F• ) Here, as usually, F(x) = Fx /mx Fx , where mx is the maximal
ideal of the ring OX,x . We call a family F• non-degenerate if, for every
x ∈ X, at least one of dn (x) : Fn (x) → Fn−1 (x) is non-zero. Having a
family F• over X and a regular mapping φ : Y → X, one gets the inverse
image φ∗ (F), which is a family of A-complexes over the variety Y such that
φ∗ (F)(y) ≃ F(φ(y)). If F• is non-degenerate, so is φ∗ (F). Given an ideal
I ⊆ J, we call a family F• an I-family if Im dn ⊆ IFn−1 for all n. Then any
inverse image φ∗ (F) is an I-family as well. Just as in [8], we construct some
“almost versal” non-degenerate I-families.
   Consider again a complete set of non-isomorphic indecomposable projec-
tive A-modules
        Ls         { A1 , A2 , . . . , As }. For each vector r = (r1 , r2 , . . . , rs ) set
rA =                                         ′                  ′
           i=1 i i , and denote I(r, r ) = HomA (rA, I · r A), where I is an
               r A
ideal contained in J. Fix a vector      L rank of bounded complexes r• = (rk | m ≤
k ≤ n) and set H = H(r, I) = nk=m+1 I(rk , rk−1 ). Consider the projective
space P = P(r• , I) = P(H) and its closed subset D = D(r• , I) ⊆ P consist-
ing of all sequences (hk ) such that hk+1 hk = 0 for all k. Because of the
universal property of projective spaces [15, Theorem II.7.1], the embedding
D(r• , I) → P(r• , I) gives rise to a non-degenerate I-family V• = V• (r• , I):
                                   d              dn−1
(5)                 V• :    Vn −−−n−→ Vn−1 −−−−→ . . . −→ Vm ,
where Vk = OD (n − k) ⊗ rk A for all m ≤ k ≤ n. We call V• (r• , I) the
canonical I-family of A-complexes over D(r• , I). Moreover, regular map-
pings φ : X → D(r• , I) correspond to non-degenerate I-families F• with
Fk = 0 for k > n or k < m and Fk = L⊗(n−k) ⊗ rk A for some invertible
sheaf L over X. Namely, such a family can be obtained as φ∗ (V• ) for a
uniquely defined regular mapping φ. Moreover, the following result holds,
which shows the “almost versality” of the families V• (r• , I).

Proposition 4.1. For every non-degenerate family of I-complexes F• of
vectorSrank r• over an algebraic variety X, there is a finite open covering
X = j Uj such that the restriction of F• onto each Uj is isomorphic to
φ∗j V• (r• , I) for a regular mapping φj : Uj → D(r• , I).
Proof. For each x ∈ X there is an open neighbourhood U ∋ x such that
all restrictions Fk |U are isomorphic to OU ⊗ rk A; so the restriction F• |U
is obtained from a regular mapping U → D(r• , I). Evidently it implies the
assertion.                                                                 
   Note that the mappings φj are not canonical, so we cannot glue them into
a “global” mapping X → D(r• , I).                     Q
   Consider now the group G = G(r• ) =                  k Aut(rk A), which acts on
H(r• , I): (gk )·(hk ) = (gk−1 hk gk−1 ). It induces the action of G(r• ) on P(R• , I)
and on D(r• , I). The definitions immediately imply that V• (r• , I)(x) ≃
V• (r• , I)(x′ ) (x, x′ ∈ D) if and only if x and x′ belong to the same orbit
of G. Consider the sets
                    Di = Di (r• , I) = { x ∈ D | dim Gx ≤ i } .
It is known that they are closed (it follows from the theorem on dimensions
of fibres, cf. [15, Exercise II.3.22] or [17, Ch. I, § 6, Theorem 7]). We set
                    par(r• , I, A) = max { dim Di (r• , I) − i }
                                        i
and call this integer the parameter number of I-complexes of vector rank
r• . Obviously, if I ⊆ I′ , then par(r• , I, A) ≤ par(r• , I′ , A). Especially, the
number par(r• , A) = par(r• , J, A) is the biggest one.
    Proposition 4.1, together with the theorem on the dimensions of fibres and
the Chevalley theorem on the image of a regular mapping (cf. [15, Exercise
II.3.19] or [17, Ch. I, § 5, Theorem 6]), implies the following result.
Corollary 4.2. Let F• be an I-family of vector rank r• over a variety X.
For each x ∈ X set Xx = { x′ ∈ X | F• (x′ ) ≃ F• (x) } and denote
                         Xi = { x ∈ X | dim Xx ≤ i } ,
                          par(F• ) = max { dim Xi − i } .
                                        i
Then all subsets Xx and Xi are constructible (i.e. finite unions of locally
closed sets) and par(F• ) ≤ par(r• , I, A).
   Note that the bases D(r• , I) of our almost versal families are projective,
especially complete varieties. In the next section we shall exploit this prop-
erty.
   Tame-wild dichotomy allows to establish the derived type of an alge-
bra knowing the behaviour of           P the numbers par(r• , A). Namely, if rk =
(rk1 , rk2 , . . . , rks ), set |r• | = k,i rki . Since it is a maximal possible num-
ber of indecomposable summands of complexes of vector rank r• , indecom-
posable complexes over derived tame algebra form at most one-parameter
families, and the parameter number grows quadratically for derived wild
algebras, the following corollary is evident.
Corollary 4.3. An algebra A is derived tame if and only if par(r• , A) ≤ |r• |
for all vector ranks r• .

   An important case is that of families of free modules, i.e. such that
Fk (x) ≃ ak A for some integer k. Namely, let r(A) = (a1 , a2 , . . . , as )
(we do not suppose that A is Morita reduced). For every vector b =
(bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ) we set ba = (bm a, bm+1 a, . . . , bn a) and write D(b, I),
par(b, I, A), etc. instead of, respectively, D(ba, I), par(ba, I, A), etc. When
we are interested in the asymptotical behaviour of parameter numbers (it is
enough, for instance, to establish the derived type), we can restrict our con-
siderations by free complexes only. Indeed, for a vector r = (r1 , r2 , . . . , rs ),
denote
                              
                            r/a = max { b | bai ≤ ri for all i } ,
                              
                            r/a = min { b | bai ≥ ri for all i } .
If r• = (rm , rm+1 , . . . , rn ), set
                                                                        
                   b = (bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ),       where bk = rk /a ;
                                                                        
                   b′ = (b′m , b′m+1 , . . . , b′n ),   where b′k = rk /a .
Then, obviously,
                    par(b′ a, I, A) ≤ par(r• , I, A) ≤ par(b, I, A).
Especially, Corollary 4.3 can be reformulated as follows.
Corollary 4.4. An algebra A is derived tame if and only if par(b, A) ≤
|b| dim A for every sequence b = (bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ).

                 5. Families of algebras. Semi-continuity
  A (flat) family of algebras over an algebraic variety X is a sheaf A of
OX -algebras, which is coherent and flat (thus locally free) as a sheaf of OX -
modules. For such a family and every sequence b = (bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ) one
can define the function par(b, A, x) = par(b, A(x)). (Recall that here bk
denote the ranks of free modules in a free complex.) Our main result is the
upper semi-continuity of these functions.
Theorem 5.1. Let A be a flat family of finite dimensional algebras over an
algebraic variety X. For every vector b = (bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ) the function
par(b, A, x) is upper semi-continuous, i.e. all sets
                            Xj = { x ∈ X | par(b, A, x) ≥ j }
are closed.
Proof. We may assume that X is irreducible. Let K be the field of rational
functions on X. We consider it as a constant sheaf on X. Set J = rad(A⊗OX
K) and J = R ∩ A. It is a sheaf of nilpotent ideals. Moreover, if ξ is the
generic point of X, the factor algebra A(ξ)/J (ξ) is semisimple. Hence there
is an open set U ⊆ X such that A(x)/J (x) is semisimple, thus J (x) =
rad A(x) for every x ∈ U . Therefore par(b, A, x) = par(b, J (x), A(x)) for
x ∈ U ; so Xj = Xj (J ) ∪ Xj′ , where
                    Xj (J ) = { x ∈ X | par(b, J (x), A(x)) ≥ j }
and  X′= X \U is a closed subset in X. Using noetherian induction, we may
suppose that Xj′ is closed, so we only have to prove that Xj (J ) is closed
too.

                                        L
   Consider the locally free sheaf H = nk=m+1 Hom(bk A, bk−1 J ) and the
projective space bundle P(H) [15, Section II.7]. Every point h ∈ P(H) de-
fines a set of homomorphisms hk : bk A(x) → bk−1 J (x) (up to a homothety),
where x is the image of h in X, and the points h such that hk hk+1 = 0 form
a closed subset D ⊆ P(H). We denote by π the restriction onto D of the
projection P(H) → X; it is a projective, hence closed mapping. Moreover,
for every point x ∈ X the fibre π −1 (x) is isomorphic
                                                Qn to D(b, A(x), J (x)).
Consider also the group variety G over X: G = k=m GLbk (A). There is a
natural action of G on D over X, and the sets Di = { z ∈ D | dim Gz ≤ i }
are closed
        in D. Therefore the sets	Zi = π(Di ) are closed
                                                    S       in X, as well as
Zij = x ∈ Zi | dim π −1 (x) ≥ i + j . But Xj (J ) = i Zij , thus it is also a
closed set.                                                                
  Taking into consideration Corollary 4.4, we obtain
Corollary 5.2. For a family of algebras A over X denote
                 Xtame = { x ∈ X | A(x) is derived tame } ,
                 Xwild = { x ∈ X | A(x) is derived wild } .
Then Xtame is a countable intersection of open subsets and Xwild is a count-
able union of closed subsets.
   The following conjecture seems very plausible, though even its analogue
for usual tame algebras has not yet been proved.
Conjecture 5.3. For any (flat) family of algebras over an algebraic variety
X the set Xtame is open.
   Recall that an algebra A is said to be a (flat) degeneration of an algebra
B, and B is said to be a (flat) deformation of A, if there is a (flat) family
of algebras A over an algebraic variety X and a point p ∈ X such that
A(x) ≃ B for all x 6= p, while A(p) ≃ A. One easily verifies that we can
always assume X to be a non-singular curve. Corollary 5.2 obviously implies
Corollary 5.4. Suppose that an algebra A is a flat degeneration of an
algebra B. If B is derived wild, so is A. If A is derived tame, so is B.
   If we consider non-flat families, the situation can completely change. The
reason is that the dimension is no more constant in these families. That is
why it can happen that such a “degeneration” of a derived wild algebra may
become derived tame, as the following example due to Brüstle [2] shows.
Example 5.5. There is a (non-flat) family of algebras A over an affine line
A1 such that all of them except A(0) are isomorphic to the derived wild
algebra B given by the quiver with relations

Namely, one has to define A(λ) as the factor algebra of the path algebra of
the quiver as in (6), but with the relations β1 α = 0, γ1 β1 = λξ1 , γ2 β2 = λξ2 .
Note that dim A = 16 and dim B = 15, which shows that this family is not
flat.
     Actually, in such a situation the following result always holds.
Proposition 5.6. Let A be a family (not necessarily flat) of algebras over
a non-singular curve X such that A(x) ≃ B for all x 6= p, where p is a
fixed point, while A(p) ≃ A. Then there is a flat family B over X such that
B(x) ≃ B for all x 6= p and B(p) ≃ A/I for some ideal I.
Proof. Note that the restriction of A onto U = X\{ p } is flat, since dim A(x)
is constant there. Let n = dim B, Γ be the quiver of the algebra B and
G = kΓ be the path algebra of Γ. Consider the Grassmannian Gr(n, G),
i.e. the variety of subspaces of codimension n of G. The ideals form a
closed subset Alg = Alg(n, G) ⊂ Gr(n, G). The restriction of the canonical
vector bundle V over the Grassmannian onto Alg is a sheaf of ideals in
G = G⊗OAlg , and the factor F = G/V is a universal family of factor algebras
of G of dimension n. Therefore there is a morphism φ : U → Alg such that
the restriction of A onto U is isomorphic to φ∗ (F). Since Alg is projective
and X is non-singular, φ can be continued to a morphism ψ : X → Alg.
Let B = ψ ∗ (F); it is a flat family of algebras over X. Moreover, B coincides
with A outside p. Since both of them are coherent sheaves on a non-singular
curve and B is locally free, it means that B ≃ A/T , where T is the torsion
part of A, and B(p) ≃ A(p)/T (p).                                           
Corollary 5.7. If a degeneration of a derived wild algebra is derived tame,
the latter has a derived wild factor algebra.
   In the Brüstle’s example 5.5, to obtain a derived wild factor algebra of
A, one has to add the relation ξ1 α = 0, which obviously holds in B.
   By the way, as a factor algebra of a tame algebra is obviously tame (which
is no more true for derived tame algebras!), we get the following corollary
(cf. also [4, 8]).
Corollary 5.8. Any deformation (not necessarily flat) of a tame algebra is
tame. Any degeneration of a wild algebra is wild.
