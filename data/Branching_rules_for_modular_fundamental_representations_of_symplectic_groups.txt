                                                     Abstract. In this paper branching rules for the fundamental representations of the
                                                     symplectic groups in positive characteristic are found. The submodule structure of the
                                                     restrictions of the fundamental modules for the group Sp2n (K) to the naturally embedded
                                                     subgroup Sp2n−2 (K) is determined. As a corollary, inductive systems of fundamental
                                                     representations for Sp∞ (K) are classified. The submodule structure of the fundamental
                                                     Weyl modules is refined.




                                                                                      1. Introduction
                                                The article is devoted to finding branching rules for the fundamental representations
                                             of the sympplectic groups in positive characteristic. The classical branching rules are
                                             concerned with the restrictions of representations of the classical algebraic and symmetric
                                             groups in characteristic 0 to naturally embedded subgroups of smaller ranks. For a group
                                             of rank n and its fixed irreducible representation ϕ they yield the composition factors
                                             of the restriction of ϕ to a naturally embedded subgroup of rank n − 1 and hence to
                                             similar subgroups of smaller ranks, at least algorithmically. These rules provide a basis
                                             for induction on rank and have found numerous applications. In positive characteristic
                                             one cannot expect to obtain complete branching rules in an explicit form in a near future
                                             since this problem is closely connected with that of finding the dimensions of arbitrary
                                             irreducible representations and the composition factors of the Weyl modules. So it is worth
                                             to investigate important particular cases where such rules can be found and to seek for
                                             asymptotic analogs of these rules. The notion of an inductive system of representations
                                             (see the definition below) introduced by Zalesskii in [11] yields an asymptotic version of the
                                             branching rules. It proved to be useful for the study of ideals in group algebras of locally
                                             finite groups as well, see, for instance, Zalesskii’s survey [12]. We classify the inductive
                                             systems of the fundamental representations for the infinite-dimensional symplectic group
                                             Sp∞ (K). This class of representations yields an example of representations of a simple
                                             form for which the branching rules in positive characteristic differ from the characteristic
                                             0 case.
                                                Let K ⊂ F be fields of characteristic p > 0, F̄ be the algebraic closure of F , and Z+
                                             be the set of nonnegative integers. Let Gn = Sp2n (K). Denote by ωin , 0 ≤ i ≤ n, the
                                             ith fundamental module and representation of Gn over F where ω0n is the trivial one. Let
                                             W0n = ω0n , W1n , . . . , Wnn be the corresponding Weyl modules. Set Win = ωin = 0 for i < 0
                                             and for i > n. The labeling of the fundamental modules is standard, the fundamental
                                             and the Weyl modules for Gn are the F -modules affording the restrictions to Gn of the
                                             relevant representations of the group Sp2n (F̄ ) (it is well known that these restrictions can
                                             be realized over F ). For an integer z > 0 we denote by lp(z) the maximal i such that

pi | z. We have lp(z) = 0 if p 6 | z. Let M be a Gn -module. The restriction of M to Gn−1
is denoted by M ↓Gn−1 . We shall write
                                     M ∼ N1 + · · · + Nq
if there is a series 0 = M0 ⊂ M1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Mq = M of submodules of M and a permutation
σ such that Nσ(i) ∼   = Mi /Mi−1 for all i = 1, . . . , q. Moreover, if in addition Mi /Mi−1
coincides with the socle of M/Mi−1 for i = 1, . . . , q, then the sequence
                               Nσ(1) ≺s Nσ(2) ≺s . . . ≺s Nσ(q)
is called the socle series of M .
   Theorem 1.1 below describes the branching rules for the fundamental Gn -modules and
the submodule structure of the restrictions of these modules to Gn−1 .

zero whenever d = 0);

                                      omitted for j < 0 is the socle series of D. In particular,
D = ω if i = 0, 1 or p 6 | n + 1 − i.

Corollary 1.2. For n ≥ 2 the restriction ωin ↓Gn−1 is completely reducible if and only if
i = 0, 1 or p 6 | n + 1 − i.
   The proof of Theorem 1.1 is based on the description of the composition factors of the
fundamental Weyl modules (Premet and Suprunenko [6, Theorem 2] for p > 2 and inde-
pendently Adamovich [1, Theorem 2 and its Corollary 1] for arbitrary p) and Adamovich’s
results [2] on the submodule structure of these Weyl modules. In Section 2 these results
are refined (Theorem 2.13). In particular, a new irreducibility criterion for the fundamen-
tal Weyl modules is obtained (Corollary 2.14) and it is proved that their socles are always
simple (Corollary 2.15).
   For n − p + 2 ≤ i ≤ n Gow [5] has given an explicit construction of the modules ωin
and has described the submodule structure of the restrictions ωin ↓G1 × Gn−1 (the natural
embedding) ([5, Theorem 2.2]). This implies our Theorem 1.1 for these modules. In
[5] a certain explicitly determined operator δ on the exterior algebra ∧V of the natural
Gn -module V is considered and it is proved that for n − p + 2 ≤ i ≤ n the module ωin
can be realized as the quotient ker δ ∩ ∧i V /δp−1 (∧i+2p−2 V ) ([5, Corollary 2.4]). This nice
construction gives a realization for an important class of modules without complicated
representation-theoretic machinery. However, it cannot be extended to other fundamental
modules since according to [5, Theorem 4.2], the quotient above is zero for i < n − p + 2.
   In [7] Sheth has found the branching rules for modular representations of symmetric
groups corresponding to two part partitions. The composition factors occurring in the
relevant restrictions are similar to those of the module D in Theorem 1.1(ii). We conjecture
that the submodule structure of these restrictions is also similar to that of D. The authors
plan to consider this question as well as the similar one for representations of special linear
groups with highest weights ωi + ωj in a subsequent paper.
   In Section 4 Theorem 1.1 is applied to classify the inductive systems of fundamental
F -representations for Sp∞ (K). Let
                                 H1 ⊂ H2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Hn ⊂ . . .                               (1)

be a sequence of groups, and Ψn , n = 1, 2, . . . , be a nonempty finite set of (inequivalent)
irreducible representations of Hn over a fixed field. The system Ψ = {ΨS     n | n = 1, 2, . . . }
is called an inductive system (of representations) for the group H = ∞         n=1 Hn if each
Ψn coincides with the union of the sets of composition factors (up to equivalence) of
the restrictions π↓Hn where π runs over Ψn+1 .SIn this article (1) is the sequence of the

Theorem 1.3. The inductive systems of fundamental representations over F for Sp∞ (K)
                                       t                t
are exhausted by the systems F, Ls , Rp −1 , and Ls ∪ Rp −1 (s ≥ 0, t ≥ 1).
   It is clear that L0 (which consists of the trivial representations) and Rp−1 are minimal
inductive systems. However, the question on the minimal inductive systems for Sp∞ (K)
is far from solution. For p > 2 Zalesskii and Suprunenko [10] have described the inductive
system Φ = {Φn | n = 1, 2, . . . } where for each n the set Φn consists of two irreducible
representations with highest weights ωn−1 + 12 (p − 3)ωn and 12 (p − 1)ωn . The system Φ
coincides with R2 for p = 3 and yields another example of a minimal inductive system for
p > 3.
   For other classical groups the questions investigated in this paper present no problems
since the situation is the same as in characteristic 0.
   The authors [3] have found the minimal and the minimal nontrivial inductive systems
for the group SL∞ (K̄). For this group the system consisting of the trivial representation
is the only minimal inductive system, and the minimal nontrivial ones are exhausted by
the systems Lj = {Ljn | n = 1, 2, . . . } and Rj = {Rnj | n = 1, 2, . . . } where Ljn consists
of two irreducible representations of SLn+1 (K̄) with highest weights 0 and pj ω1 and Rnj
of those with highest weights 0 and pj ωn . The picture is similar for the groups SL∞ and
SU∞ over locally finite fields.
   Until Proposition 4.2 we assume that K = F = F̄ . At the end Proposition 4.2 transfers
the results to arbitrary fields.

               2. The structure of the fundamental Weyl modules
   In this section we refine the results of [6], [1], and [2] on the structure of the fundamental
Weyl modules for Gn .
   Throughout the paper we set πin = ωn+1−i     n      and Vin = Wn+1−i
                                                                      n    . We denote by [a, b]
the set of all j ∈ Z+ with a ≤ j ≤ b. For an integer k ∈ Z+ write its p-adic expansion
k = k0 + k1 p + · · · + ks ps with 0 ≤ ki < p and set ki = 0 for all such i ∈ Z+ that pi > k.
We shall write k = (k0 , k1 , . . . , ks ). We say that an integer m contains k to base p and
write k ⊂p m if and only if for each i either ki = 0, or ki = mi . Set dm   k = 1 if k ⊂p m, and
dm
 k  =  0 otherwise.
                                                               P
Theorem 2.1. [6, Theorem 2] Let p > 2. Then Win ∼ ∞                    n+1−i+2k n
                                                                  k=0 dk        ωi−2k .
    We need some more notation to state Adamovich’s results. For λ ∈ Z+ define maps
s′λ : Z+ → Z+ and sλ : Z+ → Z+ setting
    s′λ (l) = l + 2k′ where l + 1 = a′ pλ − k′ , a′ ∈ Z+ , 0 ≤ k′ < pλ ;
    sλ (l) = l + 2k where l = apλ − k, a ∈ Z+ , 0 ≤ k < pλ .
We say that the reflection s′λ or sλ is l-admissible if k′ 6= 0 and p 6 | a′ or k 6= 0 and p 6 | a,
respectively. We denote by S(l) the set of all m > l that can be written in the form
4                            A. A. BARANOV AND I. D. SUPRUNENKO

m = sλu . . . sλ1 (l) where λu < · · · < λ1 and for each i = 0, 1, . . . , u − 1 the reflection sλi+1
is sλi . . . sλ1 (l)-admissible. Similarly we define S ′ (l) (writing s′λi instead of sλi ).
                                                n ∼ πn +
                                                               P              n
Theorem 2.2. [1] Let 0 ≤ l ≤ n. Then Vl+1                 l+1      m∈S ′ (l) πm+1 .

 As s′λ (x − 1) = sλ (x) − 1, the following theorem yields an equivalent statement.
                                                     P
Theorem 2.3. Let 1 ≤ l ≤ n + 1. Then Vln ∼ πln + m∈S(l) πm      n.

                                         n and V n (without restrictions on p).
 Let us rewrite Theorem 2.1 in terms of πm      l
                                         n
                                            P∞ l+2k n
Theorem 2.4. Let 1 ≤ l ≤ n + 1. Then Vl ∼ k=0 dk πl+2k .
   Now our goal is to show that Theorems 2.3 and 2.4 are equivalent, so Theorem 2.4 (and
2.1) holds for p = 2. For this purpose we prove some technical facts on the triples k, l, m
with k ⊂p m = l + 2k and admissible reflections.
   Until the end of the section l ≥ 1. For each m ∈ S(l) the tuple (λ1 ; . . . ; λu ) is uniquely
determined (see the comments before the Theorem in [2]). If u is odd for some m, set
λu+1 = lp(m). Then sλu+1 (m) = m and λu+1 < λu . Now for every m ∈ S(l) we have
a uniquely determined sequence of reflections sλ1 , . . . , sλ2t . Such sequences will be called
l-admissible. For an integer 0 ≤ a ≤ p − 1 set ā = p − 1 − a. The following lemma is
straightforward.
Lemma 2.5. Set q = lp(l). The reflection sλ is l-admissible if and only if λ > q and
lλ 6= p − 1. In that case sλ (l) = pq (¯lq + 1, ¯lq+1 , . . . ¯lλ−1 , lλ + 1, lλ+1 , . . . ).
    Two consequent applications of Lemma 2.5 yield
Proposition 2.6. Let lp(l) ≤ µ < λ, m = sµ sλ (l), and k = (m − l)/2. The pair sλ , sµ is
l-admissible if and only if lλ 6= p − 1 and lµ 6= 0. In that case
       m = (l0 , . . . , lµ−1 , ¯lµ + 1, ¯lµ+1 , . . . , ¯lλ−1 , lλ + 1, lλ+1 , . . . ),
        k = (0, . . . ,         0, ¯lµ + 1, ¯lµ+1 , . . . , ¯lλ−1 ).
In particular, k ⊂p m = l + 2k.
  We call a tuple σ = (λ1 ; . . . ; λ2t ) l-admissible if λi ∈ Z+ , λ1 > · · · > λ2t , lλ2j−1 6= p − 1
and lλ2j 6= 0 for j = 1, . . . , t. For an l-admissible σ set
                                              t
                                              [

Proposition 2.6 yields the following corollary.
Corollary 2.7. A sequence sλ1 , . . . , sλ2t is l-admissible if and only if the tuple σ =
(λ1 ; . . . ; λ2t ) is l-admissible. In that case sλ2t . . . sλ1 (l) = lσ .

Proposition 2.8. An integer m ∈ S(l) if and only if m − l = 2k > 0 and k ⊂p m.
Proof. Let σ = (λ1 ; . . . ; λ2t ) be an l-admissible tuple and m = sλ2t . . . sλ1 (l). Set m0 = l,
mj = sλ2j . . . sλ1 (l), and kj = (mj − mj−1 )/2, 1 ≤ j ≤ t. Using Proposition 2.6, one
deduces that kj ⊂p mj ; mj = lσ with σ j = (λ1 ; . . . ; λ2j ); kij = 0 and mji = mij−1 for
                                        j


 / [λ2j , λ2j−1 ]. Therefore k = k1 + . . . + kt ⊂p m.
i∈
  Assume now that m − l = 2k > 0 and k ⊂p m. Choose integers τ1 , τ2 , . . . , τ2t as follows.
Set τ0 = −1. Assume that τ2j is chosen. If there is no i > τ2j such that ki = mi 6= 0,

we set t = j and stop the process. Otherwise we choose for τ2j+1 minimal i > τ2j with
ki = mi 6= 0. As m > 2k, there exists f > τ2j+1 with kf 6= mf (observe that in this case
kf = 0). We choose minimal such f for τ2j+2 . Set λq = τ2t+1−q . Since k ⊂p m, using
Corollary 2.7 and analyzing the p-adic expansions of k and m, one can conclude that the
tuple σ = (λ1 ; . . . ; λ2t ) is l-admissible and m = lσ .

Corollary 2.9. Theorems 2.3 and 2.4 are equivalent, so Theorems 2.1 and 2.4 are valid
in characteristic 2 as well.
   Now we rewrite Adamovich’s results [2] on the submodule structure of the Weyl modules
in our terms. We fix n and write Vl and πm instead of Vln and πm        n . For m ∈ S(l) or m = l

we denote by Pl (m) the smallest submodule of Vl that has a composition factor πm . Since
Vl is multiplicity-free, Pl (m) is correctly defined and each submodule of Vl is a sum of
Pl (m) for some m. Hence the submodule structure of Vl is determined by the inclusion
relations between the submodules Pl (m) (see also comments at the beginning of [2]). We
shall write πm ≺ πq if Pl (m) ⊂ Pl (q). Let σ = (λ1 ; . . . ; λ2t ) be an l-admissible tuple. For
m = lσ set
                                                [t
                             Ql (m) = Ql (σ) =     [λ2j , λ2j−1 − 1].
                                                                 j=1
                            St
Note that Ql (m) = j=1 [τ2j−1 , τ2j − 1] where τi are as in the proof of Proposition 2.8.
For instance, for p = 3,
                             m = (0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1),
                              k = (0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
we have Qm−2k (m) = [2, 4] ∪ [7, 10]. Put also Ql (l) = ∅.
Theorem 2.10. [2] For 1 ≤ m, q ≤ n + 1 and m, q ∈ S(l) ∪ {l} the module πm ≺ πq (as
composition factors of Vl ) if and only if Ql (q) ⊂ Ql (m).

Remark 2.11. Actually the sets Pl (m) which are considered in [2] differ slightly from
Ql (m). For m ∈ S(l) one has Pl (m) = ∪tj=1 [µ2j + 1, µ2j−1 ] where µs = λs for s < 2t,
µ2t = λ2t if m 6= sλ2t−1 . . . sλ1 (l), and µ2t = 0 otherwise. However, Lemma 2.5 enables one
to deduce that Pl (m) ⊂ Pl (q) if and only if Ql (m) ⊂ Ql (q). The crucial point is that
lp(l) = lp(m) for m ∈ S(l).
   For l-admissible tuples σ = (λ1 ; . . . ; λ2t ) and σ ′ = (λ′1 ; . . . ; λ′2s ) we say that σ ≤ σ ′ if
there exists f ≤ 2t, 2s such that λi = λ′i for 1 ≤ i ≤ f and either f = 2t, or f < 2t, 2s and
λf +1 < λ′f +1 . It is convenient to assume that the empty tuple ∅ is l-admissible, ∅ ≤ σ for
all σ, l∅ = l, and Ql (∅) = ∅. The following is obvious.
                                                                                                ′
Lemma 2.12. Let σ and σ ′ be l-admissible tuples. Then lσ ≤ lσ if and only if σ ≤ σ ′ .
  Set n′ = n + 1. Construct an l-admissible tuple σ max = (µ1 ; . . . ; µ2t ) as follows. Put
µ0 = +∞. Assume that µ2j is chosen. Set µ = µ2j − 1. If there is no l-admissible tuple
(α; β) such that µ ≥ α > β and
       (l0 , . . . , lµ )(α;β) = (l0 , . . . , ¯lβ + 1, ¯lβ+1 , . . . , ¯lα−1 , lα + 1, . . . , lµ ) ≤ (n′0 , . . . , n′µ ),
we stop the process and set t = j (σ max = ∅ if t = 0). Otherwise we choose maximal such
pair (α; β) (with respect to ≤); set µ2j+1 = α and µ2j+2 = β; and if
                              (¯lβ + 1, ¯lβ+1 , . . . , ¯lα−1 , lα + 1) < (n′β , . . . , n′α ),
6                          A. A. BARANOV AND I. D. SUPRUNENKO

we stop the process and determine (µ2j+3 ; . . . ; µ2t ) as the maximal l-admissible tuple with
                         max
µ2j+3 < β. Obviously, lσ     is the maximal integer m such that πm   n is a composition factor
     n
of Vl .
   For l-admissible tuples σ and σ ′ we write σ ≺ σ ′ if and only if Ql (σ) ⊃ Ql (σ ′ ). Using
Corollary 2.7, Theorem 2.10, and Lemma 2.12, we get our main result on the structure of
fundamental Weyl modules.
Theorem 2.13. The map σ 7→ πlnσ is a poset isomorphism between the l-admissible tuples
σ ≤ σ max and the composition factors of Vln with the partial orders ≺.
   If l < n′ , we denote by v the maximal integer such that lv 6= n′v . If lv + 1 = n′v , we
denote by u the maximal integer < v such that ¯lu 6= n′u setting u = −1 if ¯li = n′i for all
i < v. Put s = lp(l).
Corollary 2.14. Let n′ = n + 1 and 1 ≤ l ≤ n′ . Then Vln is irreducible (i.e. σ max = ∅)
if and only if one of the following holds.
   (1) l = n′ ;
   (2) l < n′ and s ≥ v;
   (3) l < n′ , s < v, lv + 1 = n′v , ¯ls ≥ n′s ; li = p − 1 and n′i = 0 for s < i < v.
Proof. This follows from Proposition 2.6 and Corollary 2.7.

Corollary 2.15. Let n′ = n + 1 and 1 ≤ l ≤ n′ . The socle of Vln is always simple. For
reducible Vln it has the form πlγ with γ = (t; s) and t as follows.
   (1) t = v if s < v and either lv + 1 < n′v , or ¯lu < n′u ;
   (2) t = w if lv + 1 = n′v ; u = −1 or ¯lu > n′u ; s < w < v; lw 6= p − 1; and lj = p − 1 for
w < j < v.
Proof. Applying Results 2.6, 2.7, and 2.13, we conclude that πlγ is a composition factor
of Vln and for each l-admissible tuple τ ≤ σ max the set Ql (τ ) ⊂ [s, t − 1], so πlγ ≺ πlτ .

    3. Branching rules and the submodule structure of the restrictions
   In this section the main results of the article are proved. We shall need the following
simple lemma.
Lemma 3.1. Assume that dl+2k    k    = 1 (i.e. k ⊂p l + 2k).
  (i) If ps | l + 2k, then ps | k and ps | l.
  (ii) If ps | l, then ps | k and ps | l + 2k.
Proof. One can assume that s ≥ 1.
(i) Let ps | l + 2k. Since k ⊂p l + 2k, we have ps | k. This implies that ps | l.
(ii) Let ps | l. Then l0 = · · · = ls−1 = 0. Let r = lp(k). Assume that r < s. Since
k ⊂p l + 2k, we have kr = (2k)r 6= 0, which is impossible. Therefore r ≥ s, so ps | k and
ps | l + 2k.
   As in Section 2 , we shall omit the superscript n in our notation for modules when
it is known which group is considered. Replacing ωi by πn+1−i and Wi by Vn+1−i , one
immediately concludes that Theorem 1.1(i) is equivalent to the following
Theorem 3.2. Let 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1 and d = lp(i). Then
                                               d−1
                                                                  !

                                                t=0

where ε = 0 if i ≡ −pd (mod pd+1 ) and ε = 1 otherwise.

Proof. One can rewrite the formula in Theorem 3.2 as follows.

where

                      2, i ≡ 0 (mod pt+1 ),
                 i
                bt =   1, i ≡ apt (mod pt+1 ) and a 6≡ 0, −1 (mod p),                           (3)
                       0, i 6≡ 0 (mod pt ) or i ≡ −pt (mod pt+1 ).
                     

Recall that by convention πin = 0 for all i > n + 1, and πn+1
                                                           n  is the trivial one-dimensional
Gn -module. So (2) holds for i ≥ n + 1. Assume now that 1 ≤ l < n + 1 and (2) is valid
for all i > l. We shall prove it for i = l. Then the theorem will follow by induction.
   It follows from [4, Proposition 3.3.2 and Theorem 4.3.1] that Vl ↓Gn−1 has a filtration
by Weyl modules for Gn−1 . Then the classical branching rules for characteristic 0 [13] and
Theorem 2.4 imply
                                                                ∞

On the other hand, by Theorem 2.4, Vl ↓Gn−1 ∼ k=0 dk (πl+2k ↓Gn−1 ). Since dl0 = 1
and the branching rules for πi with i > l are assumed to satisfy (2), one can determine
the branching of πl . Therefore it suffices to check that the right part of (4) is equal to
P∞ l+2k
   k=0 dk    Ul+2k where Ui is the right part of (2). The latter sum can be rewritten as
follows:

We have to show that el+2t−1
                      t      = ftl+2t−1 for all t ≥ 0. Note that ftl+2t−1 ≤ 2. We proceed
by steps.
Step 1. At most one summand in (5) is nonzero. In particular, el+2t−1       t    ≤ 2.

                                                        6= 0 with t = k + p = k + ps and s > s′ .
                                                                                ′
                                                                              s       ′
   Assume that dk bs          6= 0 and dk′ bs′
                                                              ′
Since bl+2k
        s   6= 0, we have ps | l + 2k. As dl+2k   k   , dl+2k
                                                          k′    6= 0, by Lemma 3.1, ps divides k, l,
      ′          s        s      ′   s ′
and k . Hence p | k + p − k = p , which yields a contradiction.
   Now assume that dl+2tt    6= 0 and dl+2k
                                         k    bl+2k
                                                s    6= 0 with k + ps = t. As above, we get that
p divides k, l, and t. Let r = lp(l). Then by Lemma 3.1 (ii), pr | k and pr | t. Since
 s

k + ps = t, we have r = s, so ls 6= 0. Consider the following cases.
Case 1. k 6≡ 0 and t 6≡ 0 (mod ps+1 ). Then l + 2t ≡ t and l + 2k ≡ k (mod ps+1 ), so
ps = t − k ≡ 2(t − k) (mod ps+1 ), which is impossible.
Case 2. k ≡ 0 (mod ps+1 ). Then ts = 1. Since l + 2t ≡ t (mod ps+1 ), we have ls = p − 1,
so (l + 2k)s = p − 1. This implies that bl+2k
                                         s    = 0 and yields a contradiction.
Case 3. t ≡ 0 (mod ps+1 ). Then ks = p − 1. Therefore (l + 2k)s = ks = p − 1, so as above,
bl+2k
 s    = 0.

                     l+2t−1
   Assume that et             = 2. By Step 1, this is equivalent to the following: there exist
k, s ≥ 0 with k + ps = t such that bl+2k     s    = 2 and dl+2k
                                                              k   = 1. Hence ps+1 | l + 2k and
k ⊂p l+2k. By Lemma 3.1 (i), ps+1 divides l and k. Note that l+2t−1 = l+2k+ps +(ps −1).
Therefore t = k+ps ⊂p l+2t−1 and t−1 = k+(ps −1) ⊂p l+2t−1, so dl+2t−1       t       = dl+2t−1

as required.

                                       t−1   = 1. Let s = lp(t). Then ts 6= 0 and (t−1)s = ts −1.
Since both t and t − 1 are contained in l + 2t − 1, we have ts = 1. Moreover, we have
(l − 1)0 = · · · = (l − 1)s−1 = (t − 1)0 = · · · = (t − 1)s−1 = p − 1. Since (l + 2t − 1)s = ts = 1,
we get (l − 1)s = p − 1. Hence ps+1 | l. Set k = t − ps . Then ps+1 | k, so ps+1 | l + 2k
and bl+2k
       s    = 2. It remains to observe that k = t − ps ⊂p (l + 2t − 1) − ps − (ps − 1), so
 l+2k
dk     = 1 and el+2t−1
                   t        = dl+2k
                               k    bl+2k
                                     s     = 2.
Step 3. If el+2t−1
             t      6= 0, then ftl+2t−1 6= 0, i.e. t ⊂p l + 2t − 1 or t − 1 ⊂p l + 2t − 1.
   Let r = lp(l). First assume that dl+2t    t      = 1 (see (5)), i.e. t ⊂p l + 2t. Then by
Lemma 3.1 (ii), pr | t. One easily checks that if pr+1 6 | t, then t − 1 ⊂p l + 2t − 1, and if
pr+1 | t, then t ⊂p l + 2t − 1, as required.
   Assume now that there exist k, s ≥ 0 with k + ps = t such that dl+2k    k    = 1 and bl+2k
                                                                                           s    6= 0.
                   r                                 l+2k                          l+2t−1
By Lemma 3.1, p | k and lp(l + 2k) = r. If bs               = 2, then by Step 2, ft        = 2 6= 0.
Hence we can assume that bl+2k s    =  1. By   (3), p s | l + 2k and (l + 2k) 6= 0, p − 1, so r = s.
                                                                             s
Assume that ks = 0. Then (t−1)s = 0 and t−1 = k+ps −1 ⊂p l+2k+ps +(ps −1) = l+2t−
1. If ks 6= 0, we have ks = (l+2k)s 6= p−1, so t = k +ps ⊂p l+2k +ps +(ps −1) = l+2t−1,
as required.
Step 4. If ftl+2t−1 6= 0, then el+2t−1
                                  t      6= 0.
   If t = 0, then el−10   =  1,  so assume    that t ≥ 1. We have either t ⊂p l + 2t − 1, or
t − 1 ⊂p l + 2t − 1. One needs to show that either t ⊂p l + 2t (i.e. dl+2t    t    = 1), or there
exist k, s ≥ 0 with k + ps = t such that k ⊂p l + 2k, ps | l + 2k, and (l + 2k)s 6= p − 1
(i.e. dl+2k
        k    = 1 and bl+2k
                        s   6= 0). First assume that t ⊂p l + 2t − 1. Let s = lp(t). We have
(l + 2t − 1)s = ts 6= 0. If ps | l + 2t, then k = t − ps ⊂p l + 2t − 1 − ps − (ps − 1) = l + 2k,
ps | l + 2t − 2ps = l + 2k, and (l + 2k)s = (l + 2t − 1)s − 1 6= p − 1, as required. If ps 6 | l + 2t,
one gets t ⊂p (l + 2t − 1) + 1 = l + 2t, as desired.
   Assume now that t − 1 ⊂p l + 2t − 1. Consider the following cases.
Case 1. (t − 1)0 = 0. If (l + 2t − 1)0 = 0, then t ⊂p l + 2t. Assume that (l + 2t − 1)0 6= 0.
Set s = 0, k = t − 1. Then k = t − 1 ⊂p (l + 2t − 1) − 1 = l + 2k and (l + 2k)0 =
(l + 2t − 1)0 − 1 6= p − 1, as required.
Case 2. (t − 1)0 6= 0, p − 1. Then (l + 2t − 1)0 = (t − 1)0 6= p − 1, so t ⊂p l + 2t.
Case 3. p | t. Let s = lp(t). Since t − 1 ⊂p l + 2t − 1, we have ps | l + 2t, so ps | l. As
ps+1 6 | t, the integer (t − 1)s 6= p − 1. If (t − 1)s 6= 0, then (l + 2t − 1)s = (t − 1)s 6= p − 1,
so t ⊂p l + 2t. Assume now that (t − 1)s = 0. This implies ts = 1. If (l + 2t − 1)s = 0,
then t ⊂p l + 2t. Therefore one can suppose that (l + 2t − 1)s ≥ 1. Then k = t − ps ⊂p
(l+2t−1)−ps −(ps −1) = l+2k, ps | l+2t−2ps = l+2k, and (l+2k)s = (l+2t−1)s −1 6= p−1,
as required.
    Now we investigate the submodule structure of the restriction πin ↓Gn−1 . Let n > 1 and
1 ≤ i ≤ n. As πin is the top composition factor of Vin , it follows from (4) that πin ↓Gn−1 is
a quotient of the Gn−1 -module Vin ↓Gn−1 ∼ Vi−1 + 2Vi + Vi+1 . Applying Smith’s theorem
[8] both to Vi and πi , we conclude that Vin ↓Gn−1 = Vi ⊕ Vi ⊕ V where V ∼ Vi−1 + Vi+1 , and
πin ↓Gn−1 = πi ⊕ πi ⊕ D where D is a quotient of V . Now Theorem 1.1(ii) and Corollary 1.2
follow immediately from

Theorem 3.3. Let d = lp i. Set ε = 0 if i ≡ −pd (mod pd+1 ) and ε = 1 otherwise;
jq = i − 1 + 2pq . Choose minimal t ∈ Z+ such that jt > n. Put d′ = min{d, t}. Then
           πj0 ≺s πj1 ≺s · · · ≺s πjd′ −1 ≺s πi−1 ⊕ επjd ≺s πjd′ −1 ≺s · · · ≺s πj1 ≺s πj0
is the socle series of D. In particular, D = πi−1 ⊕ επjd if d′ = 0.
Proof. By Theorem 3.2, D ∼ πi−1 + 2πj0 + · · · + 2πjd′ −1 + επjd . It follows from Theorem 2.4
that the factors πi−1 , πj0 , . . . , πjd′ −1 come from Vi−1 and the factors πj0 , . . . , πjd′ −1 , and
επjd if nonzero come from Vi+1 . Note that
                   jk = i − 1 + 2pk = i + pk + (pk − 1) = i + (p − 1, . . . , p − 1, 1),
                                                               |       {z         }
                                                                             k

so   Qi−1 (jk )   = [k, d − 1] for all 0 ≤ k ≤ d − 1. Therefore by Theorem 2.10,
                              πj0 ≺ πj1 ≺ · · · ≺ πjd′ −1 ≺ πi−1    in Vi−1 .                        (6)
Similarly, we get Qi+1 (jk ) = [0, k − 1] for 1 ≤ k < d (and for k = d if ε 6= 0 and d > 0).
Hence
                               επjd ≺ πjd′ −1 ≺ · · · ≺ πj1 ≺ πj0   in Vi+1 .                        (7)
(Here the symbol ≺ is extended to the zero module in the natural way.) Since πin is
selfdual, D is selfdual also. Let D1 ≺s · · · ≺s Dm be the socle series of D. Recall that D
has a filtration by quotients of Vi−1 and Vi+1 . As the factor πi−1 has multiplicity 1 and D
is selfdual, (6) implies that πi−1 is a factor of Dq with d′ + 1 ≤ q ≤ m − d′ , so m ≥ 2d′ + 1.
If επjd = 0, then m = 2d′ + 1 is the composition length of D and the theorem follows from
(6) and (7). Assume that επjd 6= 0. As above, by the selfduality of D and (7), πjd is a
factor of Dq′ with d′ + 1 ≤ q ′ ≤ m − d′ . Assume that q ′ 6= q. Then m = 2d′ + 2, so D
is uniserial, which contradicts the selfduality of D. Hence q ′ = q and the theorem follows
from (6) and (7).

Remark 3.4. Obviously, if επjd = 0 (i.e. d′ < d or i ≡ −pd (mod pd+1 )), then the module
D is uniserial, so has exactly 2d′ + 2 different submodules. Since D is selfdual, one can
easily observe that D has exactly 2d + 4 different submodules in the case where επjd 6= 0
(i.e. d = d′ and i 6≡ −pd (mod pd+1 )).

           4. Inductive systems and the transfer to an arbitrary field
   In this section the inductive systems of fundamental representations for Sp∞ (K) are
classified and the results of the paper are transferred to an arbitrary field.
                                                                       t−1                 t −1
Proposition 4.1. (i) Let Ψ be an inductive system and Rp ⊂ Ψ. Then Rp                             ⊂ Ψ.
  (ii) Rk is an inductive system if and only if k = pt − 1, t ≥ 1.
                                 t
Proof. (i) Assume that Rp −1 6⊂ Ψ. Choose maximal l such that Rl ⊂ Ψ. Then pt−1 ≤ l <
pt − 1. Take minimal s such that ls 6= p − 1 and set i = ps (ls , ls+1 , . . . ). Then i > 0 and
Ri ⊂ Ψ. One has lp(i) ≥ s. Moreover, if lp(i) = s, then i 6≡ −ps (mod ps+1 ). Therefore
                                 n−1                                  n                            s
Theorem 3.2 implies that πi−1+2p        s is a composition factor of πi ↓Gn−1 for n ≥ i − 1 + 2p ,
               s
and Ri−1+2p ⊂ Ψ. As i − 1 + 2ps > l, we get a contradiction.
                                                     t
   (ii) In view of (i), it suffices to verify that Rp −1 is an inductive system. By Theorem 3.2,
we need only to check that if i < pt − 1 and s = lp(i), then i − 1 + 2ps ≤ pt − 1 if is 6= p − 1,
and i − 1 + 2ps−1 ≤ pt − 1 if is = p − 1 and s > 0. But this is clear since i ≤ (p − 2)ps + (p −
1)ps+1 + . . . + (p − 1)pt−1 in the first case and i ≤ (p − 1)ps + (p − 1)ps+1 + . . . + (p − 1)pt−1
in the second one.

                                                                                     t
Proof of Theorem 1.3. Theorem 1.1(i) and Proposition 4.1 yield that F, Ls , Rp −1 , and
         t
Ls ∪ Rp −1 , s ≥ 0, t ≥ 1, are inductive systems for Sp∞ (K).
   Let Ψ = {Ψi , i = 1, 2, . . . } be an inductive system of fundamental representations. It
is clear that either for every s, u ∈ Z+ there exist n and l such that ωln ∈ Ψn , l > s,
and n + 1 − l > u, or Ψ ⊂ Ls ∪ Ru for some s and u. In the first case we claim that
Ψ = F. Indeed, fix m and l, 0 ≤ l ≤ m. Then one can choose k and n such that ωkn ∈ Ψn ,
k ≥ l, and n − k ≥ m − l. Since Ψ is an inductive system, Theorem 1.1(i) implies that
ωln+l−k ∈ Ψn+l−k and ωlm ∈ Ψm . Hence Ψ = F.
   Next, suppose that Ψ ⊂ Ls ∪ Ru . Choose minimal s and u with this property assuming
that s = −1 if Ψ ⊂ Ru and u = 0 if Ψ ⊂ Ls . (Observe that for all s and u, (Ls ∩ Ru )n = ∅
for n large enough.) We shall prove that Ψ = Ls ∪ Ru and u = pt − 1 with t ∈ Z+ (in
particular, Ψ = Ru for s = −1 and Ψ = Ls for u = 0).
   First let u > 0. We claim that Ru ⊂ Ψ and u = pt − 1. As Ψ 6⊂ Ls and Ψ and Ls
are inductive systems, Ψn ∩ Run 6= ∅ for infinitely many integers n. So there exists v ≤ u
such that πvn ∈ Ψn for infinitely many n. Choose maximal such v. Theorem 3.2 yields
that πvn ∈ Ψn for all n ≥ v − 1 and Rv ⊂ Ψ. Now Proposition 4.1 and the choice of v
imply that v = pt − 1 and Rv is an inductive system. It remains to show that v = u.
Suppose this is not the case. As Ψ 6⊂ Ls ∪ Rv , there exist l and t such that v < l ≤ u,
t > s + l − 1, and πlt ∈ Ψt . Since Ψ, Ls , and Rv are inductive systems, this implies that
for every k > t there exists πm   k ∈ Ψ with v < m ≤ u which contradicts the choice of v.
                                   k    k            k
                 t
Hence v = u = p − 1 and R ⊂ Ψ.   u

   Now we show that Ls ⊂ Ψ if s ≥ 0. As Ψ 6⊂ Ls−1 ∪ Ru , for some n > s + u − 1 we have
ωsn ∈ Ψn . Since Ψ, Ru , and Ls−1 for s ≥ 1 are inductive systems, this forces ωsn ∈ Ψn for
all n ≥ s. Now Theorem 1.1 yields that Ls ⊂ Ψ, as desired.


Proposition 4.2. All theorems of the paper hold for arbitrary F ⊃ K.

Proof. Since the restrictions of the fundamental representations of a semisimple algebraic
group over an algebraically closed field to relevant Chevalley groups over arbitrary subfields
remain irreducible and can be realized over these subfields, only Theorems 1.1(ii) (or 3.3),
2.10, and 2.13 require some analysis. Let M be the Gn -module ωin+1 ↓Gn or Win .
   First assume that F = F̄ is algebraically closed. Set H = Sp2n (F ). Let L be the Lie
algebra of H. For a root α of H and t ∈ F denote by xα (t) ∈ H and Xα ∈ L the root
elements in H and L associated with α. It is well known that xα (t)(m) = (1 + tXα )m for
m ∈ M and long α (see, for instance, [6, Lemma 1]). For g ∈ Gn set xgα (t) = gxα (t)g−1
and Xαg = gXα g−1 . It is clear that Xαg ∈ L. It suffices to show that each Gn -submodule
N ⊂ M is an H-submodule. Obviously, xgα (t)N = N and Xαg N ⊂ N for all long roots
α, g ∈ Gn , and t ∈ K. But this forces xgα (t)N = N for all t ∈ F . However, using the
commutator relations for the Chevalley groups of type C (see, for instance, [9, Lemma 15]),
one can deduce that the subgroup generated by all xgα (t) with g ∈ Gn , t ∈ F , and long
α coincides with H. (Here, in fact, it suffices to make computations within subgroups of
type C2 and show that our subgroup contains all short root subgroups). Hence N is an
H-module, as desired.
   Now let F ⊃ K be arbitrary. For a finite dimensional F Gn -module S set S̄ = S ⊗F F̄
and denote the socle of S by soc(S). Since dim HomF Gn (E, S) = dim HomF̄ Gn (Ē, S̄) for
any F Gn -module E, we have soc(S̄) = soc(S) if all composition factors of S are absolutely
irreducible. The same holds for other members of the socle series of S. If M = Win , then
M and M̄ are multiplicity-free and their submodules are completely determined by the
sets of composition factors. Therefore the arguments on socles allow us to conclude that
each submodule of M̄ has the form S̄ for some submodule S ⊂ M .

   Let M = ωin+1 ↓Gn with i, n ≥ 1. Then the socle of M contains a submodule V ∼  n ⊕
                                                                               = ωi−1
  n
ωi−1 . Since M and V are selfdual and M has only two composition factors isomorphic
     n , there exists a submodule D of M such that M = V ⊕ D and D̄ is the unique
to ωi−1
submodule in M̄ with M̄ = V̄ ⊕ D̄. Now one can see that the socle series of D is determined
by that of D̄ and is described by Theorem 1.1(ii).
