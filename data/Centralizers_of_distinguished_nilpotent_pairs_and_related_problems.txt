                                                     Abstract. In this paper, by establishing an explicit and combinato-

                                                     precisely, we show that disinguished nilpotent pairs are wonderful in
                                                     types A, B and C, but they are not always wonderful in type D. Also,

                                                     we have that almost principal nilpotent pairs do not exist in the simply-
                                                     laced case and that the centralizer of an almost principal nilpotent pair
                                                     in a classical simple Lie algebra is always abelian.

                                                The study of nilpotent pairs in semisimple Lie algebras is due to V.
                                             Ginzburg [2]. Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed
                                             field of characteristic zero and let G be its adjoint group. Then a pair of
                                             commuting nilpotent elements e = (e1 , e2 ) in g is called a nilpotent pair if
                                             there exists a pair of commuting semisimple elements h = (h1 , h2 ) having
                                             rational eigenvalues in the adjoint action such that [hi , ej ] = δi,j ej . The
                                             pair h is called an associated semisimple pair (or a characteristic of e by
                                             D. Panyushev [3]). The theory of nilpotent pairs can be viewed as a double
                                             counterpart of the theory of nilpotent orbits and Ginzburg showed in [2]
                                             that the theory of principal nilpotent pairs, i.e. the simultaneous central-
                                             izer of e has dimension rk g, has a refinement of Kostant’s results on regular
                                             nilpotent elements in g.
                                                Although the number of G-orbits of nilpotent pairs is infinite, it was
                                             shown in [2] that, as in the classical case, the number of G-orbits of principal
                                             nilpotent pairs is finite. Generalizing the notion of distinguished nilpotent
                                             element, Ginzburg also introduced the notion of distinguished nilpotent pairs
                                             which are defined to be those such that the simultaneous centralizer does
                                             not contain any semisimple elements and the simultaneous centralizer of an
                                             associated semisimple pair is a Cartan subalgebra, and he conjectured that
                                             the number of G-orbits of distinguished nilpotent pairs is finite. In [1], A.

Elashvili and D. Panyushev gave a positive answer to this conjecture in the
case of classical simple Lie algebras by giving an explicit classification of
distinguished nilpotent pairs in these Lie algebras.
   On the other hand, Panyushev [3] introduced the notion of wonderful
nilpotent pairs (see Section 5 for the definition) and he gave a proof of the
finiteness of the number of G-orbits of wonderful nilpotent pairs. In the
pursuit of a classification-free approach to the finiteness of the number of
G-orbits of distinguished nilpotent pairs, he conjectured that distinguished
nilpotent pairs are wonderful.
   In the first part of this paper, we give a complete description of the
centralizer of a distinguished nilpotent pair for a classical simple Lie algebra
g. This is done by generalizing the approach of Ginzburg [2] in the case
of sl(V ), using skew diagrams. This description is very explicit and our
starting point is the classification of Elashvili and Panyushev.
   The combinatorial tool introduced here allows us to study in a purely
diagram-theoretic manner the dimension of the centralizer of a distinguished
nilpotent pair. In particular, we prove that the dimension of its positive
quadrant is greater than or equal to the rank of g, and we determine exactly
when equality holds. An application of our results shows that a distinguished
nilpotent pair is wonderful in type A, B or C, but it is only so in type D
under certain (necessary and sufficient) conditions. Thus we answer the
above conjecture completely in the classical case.
   In [4], Panyushev studied another class of nilpotent pairs called almost
principal. A nilpotent pairs is called almost principal if its centralizer has
dimension rk g + 1. He proved that an almost principal nilpotent pair is
distinguished and wonderful and he gave examples of such nilpotent pairs
in the non simply-laced cases. He suspected that almost nilpotent pairs do
not exist in the simply-laced cases and suggested that the centralizer of an
almost principal nilpotent pair is abelian.
   Using our results on the centralizers of distinguished nilpotent pairs, we
give a classification of almost principal nilpotent pairs. As corollaries, we
confirm that there are indeed no almost principal nilpotent pairs in the
simply-laced cases and also that the centralizer of an almost principal nilpo-
tent is effectively abelian.
   In Section 1, we define our combinatorial tool and recall the classification
of Elashvili and Panyushev. In Section 2, we prove that the centralizer of
a distinguished nilpotent pair has a basis indexed by a certain set of pairs
of skew diagrams. We study in Section 3 and 4 the combinatorics of this
set of pairs of skew diagrams. In Section 5, we give necessary and sufficient
conditions for a distinguished nilpotent pair to be wonderful. Sections 6 and
7 are devoted to the classification of almost principal nilpotent pairs and to
their centralizer.

                                                                 3

Torasso for his comments on earlier versions of this paper.

          1. Generalities on distinguished nilpotent pairs
   Let e = (e1 , e2 ) be a nilpotent pair, and h = (h1 , h2 ) an associated
semisimple pair. The nilpotent pair e is called distinguished if its cen-
tralizer Z(e) := Zg(e1 ) ∩ Zg(e2 ) in g contains no semisimple element and the
centralizer Z(h) := Zg(h1 ) ∩ Zg(h2 ) is a Cartan subalgebra of g.
   Before recalling the classification of distinguished nilpotent pairs in classi-
cal simple Lie algebras, we shall start by defining the combinatorial objects
involved.
Definition 1.1. By a diagram, we mean a subset Γ of R2 such that there
exist x, y ∈ R such that Γ ⊂ Z2 + (x, y). It is called connected if given
(i, j), (k, l) ∈ Γ, there exists a sequence of elements (a1 , b1 ), · · · , (an , bn ) in
Γ such that
  i) (a1 , b1 ) = (i, j) and (an , bn ) = (k, l);
 ii) for 1 ≤ t ≤ n − 1, (at+1 − at )2 + (bt+1 − bt )2 = 1.
  A skew diagram is a connected diagram Γ of R2 such that

  1. Γ is finite;
  2. if (i, j) ∈ Γ and (i + 1, j + 1) ∈ Γ, then (i + 1, j) and (i, j + 1) ∈ Γ.
  A subset Γ′ of a skew diagram Γ is called a skew subdiagram if Γ′ is a
skew diagram and if (i, j) ∈ Γ′ , then (i − 1, j), (i, j − 1) 6∈ Γ \ Γ′ .

Remark 1.2. Our definition corresponds to the usual definition of con-
nected skew diagrams.
  Let σ : R2 → R2 be the central symmetric bijection sending (i, j) to
(−i, −j).
Definition 1.3. A skew diagram Γ is centrally symmetric if Γ = σ(Γ).
A subset Γ′ of a skew diagram Γ is called a σ-skew subdiagram if σ(Γ′ )
is a skew subdiagram of σ(Γ).
   Note that there are three types of centrally symmetric skew diagrams:

            Integral: Γ ⊂ Z2 ;
       Semi-integral: Γ ⊂ Z2 + (1/2, 0) or (0, 1/2);
       Non-Integral: Γ ⊂ Z2 + (1/2, 1/2);
   The notion of a σ-skew subdiagram will be used to describe the centralizer
of e. It corresponds to what Ginzburg called an out-subset in [2], while a
skew subdiagram corresponds to an in-subset.

Example 1.4. We shall represent a skew diagram by boxes. For example,
the following is a skew diagram which is centrally symmetric if (i, j) = (0, 0).



                                    (i, j)



The subset {(i − 1, j), (i, j), (i, j − 1)} is a skew subdiagram and {(i + 1, j),
(i, j), (i, j + 1)} is a σ-skew subdiagram.
   Let us now recall the classification of distinguished nilpotent pairs in
classical simple Lie algebras of A. Elashvili and D. Panyushev.
Theorem 1.5. [1] The set of conjugacy classes of distinguished nilpotent
pairs in g is in bijection with:
Type A - the set of diagrams Γ of cardinal rk g + 1 such that
    • Γ is a skew diagram;                P                   P
    • the barycentre of Γ is (0, 0), i.e.   (i,j)∈Γ i = 0 and   (i,j)∈Γ j = 0

Type B - the set of pairs of centrally symmetric skew diagrams (Γ1 , Γ2 ) (we
allow empty diagrams) such that
    • Card Γ1 + Card Γ2 = 2 rk g + 1;
    • Γ1 is integral and Γ2 is non integral.
Type C - the set of pairs of centrally symmetric skew diagrams (Γ1 , Γ2 ) (we
allow empty diagrams) such that
    • Card Γ1 + Card Γ2 = 2 rk g;
    • Γ1 and Γ2 are semi-integral and Γ1 ⊂ Z2 + (0, 1/2), Γ2 ⊂ Z2 + (1/2, 0).
Type D - the set of triples (Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ3 ) of centrally symmetric skew diagrams
and ǫ ∈ {1, 2} (we allow empty diagrams) such that
   • Card Γ1 + Card Γ2 + Card Γ3 = 2 rk g;
   • Γ1 is non integral;
   • either Γ2 and Γ3 are empty or they are both non empty, integral with
Γ ∩ Γ3 = {(0, 0)} =
 2                6 Γ3 and ǫ = 1.
   We shall finish this section by expliciting the corresponding distinguished
nilpotent pairs listed in Theorem 1.5. Let (Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ3 ) be as above, and
                       M              M               M

(e1 , e2 ) is the corresponding distinguished nilpotent pair with h = (h1 , h2 )
as the associated semi-simple pair.

Type C, Γ3 = ∅, and define the non-degenerate alternating bilinear form
on V by
                       n      m

Then e = (e1 , e2 ) is the corresponding distinguished nilpotent pair with
h = (h1 , h2 ) as the associated semi-simple pair.
Type D, define the non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on V by
                             n      m
                           (vi,j , vk,l ) = δi,−k δj,−l δn,m .

Then e = (e1 , e2 ) is the corresponding distinguished nilpotent pair with
h = (h1 , h2 ) as the associated semi-simple pair.
Remark 1.6. 1. The construction for type C differs from the one in [1].
It seems that our construction is more adapted for our purpose since the
definitions of the ei ’s are much simpler.
   2. For type D, the parameter ǫ is not present here in the description.
This is however not important concerning the description of the centralizer.
The fact is that in this special case, there are two classes of distinguished
nilpotent pairs admitting such a description (the corresponding bases for V
are not conjugate).

2. Description of the centralizer of a distinguished nilpotent
                              pair
   Let Z(e) be the centralizer of e in g. Note that it is hi -stable for i =
1, 2. Thus it is Q2 -graded and we shall denote by Zp,q (e) the homogeneous
component of degree (p, q) which is nothing but the (h1 , h2 )-eigenspace of
eigenvalue (p, q). Since e is distinguished, the centralizer Z(h) of h in g is a
Cartan subalgebra. But g0,0 = Z(h), so Z0,0 (e) = 0 since Z(e) contains no
semi-simple elements.
   Note that by Theorem 1.5, in fact Zp,q (e) is non zero only if p, q are half
integers, i.e. 2p, 2q ∈ Z and p + q ∈ Z.
LLet us conserve     the notations in Section 1 and for 1 ≤ k ≤ 3, set Vk =
              k
   (i,j)∈Γk Cvi,j .
6                               RUPERT W.T. YU

   Let x ∈ Zp,q (e). When k 6= l, Vk and Vl are orthogonal with respect to the
corresponding non-degenerate g-invariant bilinear form, it followsP that if πk
denotes the canonical orthogonal projection, then x is the sum k,l πl ◦x◦πk .
For simplicity, let us fix k and l and assume that x = πl ◦ x ◦ πk + πk ◦ x ◦ πl
if k 6= l and x = πk ◦ x ◦ πk if k = l; i.e. xVk ⊂ Vl , xVl ⊂ Vk and xVj = 0 if
j 6= k, l.
Definition 2.1. We define Γkx = {(i, j) ∈ Γk such that x.vi,j
                                                          k 6= 0}.


    We are interested in the connected components of Γkx .
Lemma 2.2. Let C be a connected component of Γkx . Then,
    a) C is a skew subdiagram of Γk .
    b) C + (p, q) is a σ-skew subdiagram of Γl .
Proof. Let (i, j) ∈ C. If (i − 1, j) belongs to Γk , then 0 6= e1 vi−1,j
                                                                   k         k .
                                                                         ∈ Cvi,j
Hence
                               k            k
                          e1 xvi−1,j = xe1 vi−1,j 6= 0
which implies that (i − 1, j) ∈ C. The same argument applies to (i, j − 1)
and part a) follows.
                                             k ∈ Cv l
   For b), again let (i, j) ∈ C. Thus 0 6= xvi,j   i+p,j+q . If (i+p+1, j+q) ∈
 l           l
Γ , then e1 vi+p,j+q 6= 0. Hence
                             xe1 vi,j = e1 xvi,j 6= 0.
It follows that xvi+1,j 6= 0, (i+1, j) ∈ C and (i+1+p, j +q) ∈ C +(p, q) ⊂ Γl .
The same argument applies to (i + p, j + q + 1) and we have proved that
C + (p, q) is a σ-skew subdiagram of Γl .
    Note that C and C + (p, q) are of the same shape.
    Denote by Cxk the set of connected components of Γkx .
Proposition 2.3. Let g be of type A, then          1       C ∈ Cx1 , define xC
                                          L Γ = Γ . For
                                                     1
to be the obvious restriction of x to VC = (i,j)∈C Cvi,j . Then xC ∈ Zp,q (e)
          P
and x = C∈Cx1 xC .
Proof. Since x commutes with the ei ’s, it is clear that xC is nilpotent and
commutes also with the ei ’s and so the first statement is clear. The last
statement is also clear since we are taking connected components.
   For types B, C and D, the Γj ’s are centrally symmetric and we have the
following lemma.
Lemma 2.4. Let g be of type other than A, then for any C ∈ Cxk , σ(C) −
(p, q) ∈ Cxl .
Proof. By Lemma 2.2, C + (p, q) is a σ-skew subdiagram of Γl . Since Γl is
centrally symmetric, σ(C) − (p, q) = σ(C + (p, q)) is a skew subdiagram of
Γl .

                                                                 7

   Now let (i, j) ∈ C and denote by ( , ), the g-invariant non-degenerate
bilinear form corresponding to the type of g as explained in Section 1. We
have
                    k      l               k       l
                 (xvi,j , v−i−p,−j−q ) + (vi,j , xv−i−p,−j−q ) = 0.
         l
Thus xv−i−p,−j−q   6= 0 and (−i − p, −j − q) ∈ Γlx .
   To finish the proof, it suffices to show that σ(C) − (p, q) is a connected
component of Γlx . Let (i, j) ∈ σ(C) − (p, q) be such that (i + 1, j) ∈ Γlx .
                 l
We have 0 6= xvi+1,j        k
                       ∈ Cvi+1+p,j+q  . By central symmetry, this means that
                         k
(−i − 1 − p, −j − q) ∈ Γ . This in turn implies that (−i − 1 − p, −j − q) ∈ C
since (−i − p, −j − q) ∈ C and C is a skew subdiagram. Thus (i + 1, j) ∈
σ(C) − (p, q).
   The same argument applies for (i, j + 1) and this proves that σ(C) − (p, q)
is a connected component of Γlx .

Definition 2.5. We define the set
         Cxk,l := {{C, C ′ } | C ∈ Cxk , C ′ ∈ Cxl and σ(C) = C ′ + (p, q)}.

Remark 2.6. First of all, note that we take subsets instead of pairs to avoid
repetitions when k = l. Also it is clear that Cxk,l and Cxl,k are identical.

Proposition 2.7. Let g be of type other than A, {C, C ′ } ∈ Cxk,l and xC,C ′
                        L         k ⊕
                                      L            l
the restriction of x to (i,j)∈C Cvi,j
          P                            (i,j)∈C ′ Cvi,j . Then xC,C ′ ∈ Zp,q (e)
and x = {C,C ′ }∈C k,l xC,C ′ .
                     x

Proof. It is clear that xC,C ′ commutes with the ei ’s and a direct computa-
tion shows that xC,C ′ ∈ g. The second statement follows from Lemma 2.4
(which is also true if we exchange k et l) since we are considering connected
components.
  Note that xC,C ′ = xC ′ ,C .
  It is now clear how to define an indexing set for a set of generators of
Zp,q (e).
Definition 2.8. Let Ep,q (e)k be the set of skew subdiagrams C in Γk such
that C ′ = C + (p, q) is a σ-skew subdiagram of Γk .
   For k 6= l, let Ep,q (e)k,l be the set of pairs of skew subdiagrams (C1 , C2 )
such that C1 is a skew subdiagram of Γk , C2 is a skew subdiagram of Γl and
C1 + (p, q) = σ(C2 ).
   For k = l, p, q are integers. If p + q is odd, then let Ep,q (e)k,k be the set of
subsets of skew subdiagrams {C1 , C2 } in Γk such that C1 + (p, q) = σ(C2 ).
If p + q even, then let Ep,q (e)k,k be the set of subsets of skew subdiagrams
{C1 , C2 } in Γk such that C1 6= C2 and C1 + (p, q) = σ(C2 ).
   Set Ep,q (e) to be Ep,q (e)1 if g is of type A with Γ = Γ1 and to be the
disjoint union of the Ep,q (e)k,l ’s with k ≤ l if g is of type B, C or D.

Theorem 2.9. For (p, q) 6= (0, 0), the subspace Zp,q (e) has a basis indexed
by the set Ep,q (e).
Proof. We shall first show that if x ∈ Ep,q (e) and C1 ∈ Cx1 (resp. {C1 , C2 } ∈
Cxk,l ), then the element xC1 (resp. xC1 ,C2 ) as defined in Propositions 2.3
(resp. Proposition 2.7) is uniquely determined by C1 (resp. C1 , C2 ) up to a
scalar.
             k = ak v k
    Let e1 vi,j                      k      k k                                     k
                     i,j i+1,j , e2 vi,j = bi,j vi+1,j and if appropriate, we let (vi,j ,
 k
v−i,−j   ) = dki,j .
    Let x be in Zp,q (e) with the appropriate property. For (i, j) ∈ Γkx , xvi,j  k =

λki,j vi+p,j+q
       l       .
   Now let us fix k and l and let (i, j) ∈ C1 ∈ Cxk,l . If (i + 1, j) ∈ C1 , then
        k = x e v k implies that
e1 xC1 vi,j  C1 1 i,j

                              ali+p,j+q λki,j = λki+1,j aki,j .
Similarly, if (i, j + 1) ∈ C1 , then
                              bli+p,j+q λki,j = λki,j+1 bki,j .
In the case of type A and C, aki,j = bki,j = 1 and we have

                               λki+1,j = λki,j = λki,j+1 .
In the case of type B and D, aki,j = (−1)i+j = −bki,j and we have

                           λki+1,j = (−1)p+q λki,j = λki,j+1 .
Also, we have for types B, C and D,
                      k      l               k       l
                   (xvi,j , v−i−p,−j−q ) + (vi,j , xv−i−p,−j−q )=0
which implies that
                         λki,j dli+p,j+q + λl−i−p,−j−q dki,j = 0.
When k = l, we have p, q ∈ Z. If p + q is even, then we must have C1 6= C2
because from the classification of Section 1, dki,j = 1 for types B, D and
dki,j = (−1)i+j+1/2 for type C (one should treat the case where C1 = {(i, j)}
separately).
    Since p, q are fixed and C1 is connected, we observe that the restriction
of x on VC1 and VC2 are uniquely determined by the value of λki,j (i, j, k are
fixed here). It follows that xC1 (resp. xC1 ,C2 ) is uniquely determined by C1
(resp. (C1 , C2 )) up to a scalar.
    By Propositions 2.3 and 2.7, we have that Zp,q (e) is spanned by a set of
elements indexed by a subset of Ep,q (e). To finish the proof of this theorem,
il suffices to construct an element of Zp,q (e) for each element of Ep,q (e) and
show that they form a basis of Zp,q (e). Recall that Zp,q (e) is non zero only
if 2p, 2q ∈ Z and p + q ∈ Z.

Type A. Let Γ be a skew diagram with barycentre (0, 0) and C ∈ Ep,q (Γ).
Define xC ∈ gl(V ) by
                               
                                 vi+p,j+q if (i, j) ∈ C

                                    0      otherwise.
Then a simple verification shows that xC commutes with e1 and e2 . Further
xC is nilpotent since (p, q) 6= (0, 0) and therefore xC ∈ sl(V ).
Types B and D. Let Γk , Γl be centrally symmetric skew diagrams. Let
{C, C ′ } ∈ Ep,q (Γk , Γl ) be such that k 6= l or C 6= C ′ . Define xC,C ′ ∈ gl(V )
by
                                 l

                  xC,C ′ vi,j =   −vi+p,j+q   if (i, j) ∈ C ′ , m = l
                                
                                       0             otherwise
if p + q is even; and if p + q is odd, we set
                            
                             (−1)i+j vi+p,j+q
                                       l       if (i, j) ∈ C, m = k
                      m
              xC,C ′ vi,j =   (−1) vi+p,j+q if (i, j) ∈ C ′ , m = l
                                  i+j  k
                            
                                     0               otherwise.
Again a simple verification shows that xC,C ′ commutes with e1 and e2 , and
that xC,C ′ is nilpotent since (p, q) 6= (0, 0). Finally, we verify easily that for
(i, j) ∈ C,
                      k      l               k             l
             (xC,C ′ vi,j , v−i−p,−j−q ) + (vi,j , xC,C ′ v−i−p,−j−q ) = 0.

Therefore xC,C ′ ∈ Zp,q (e).
  Now suppose that l = k and p + q is odd. Let C ∈ Ep,q (Γk ) be such that
C = σ(C) − (p, q). Define xC,C ∈ gl(V ) by
                         
                   m         (−1)i+j vi+p,j+q

            xC,C vi,j =
                                    0               otherwise.
The same verification works and therefore xC,C ∈ Zp,q (e).
Type C. Let Γk , Γl be centrally symmetric skew diagrams. Let {C, C ′ } ∈
Ep,q (Γk , Γl ) be such that k 6= l or C 6= C ′ . Define xC,C ′ ∈ gl(V ) by
                                    l
                                   vi+p,j+q        if (i, j) ∈ C, m = k
                       m           p+q+1
               xC,C ′ vi,j =   (−1)       vi+p,j+q if (i, j) ∈ C ′ , m = l
                                           k
                             
                                       0                  otherwise.
Again a simple verification shows that xC,C ′ commutes with e1 and e2 , and
that xC,C ′ is nilpotent since (p, q) 6= (0, 0). Finally, we verify easily that for
(i, j) ∈ C,
                      k      l               k             l
             (xC,C ′ vi,j , v−i−p,−j−q ) + (vi,j , xC,C ′ v−i−p,−j−q ) = 0.

Therefore xC,C ′ ∈ Zp,q (e).

  Now suppose that l = k and p + q is odd. Let C ∈ Ep,q (Γk ) be such that
C = σ(C) − (p, q). Define xC,C ∈ gl(V ) by
                            l
                     m       vi+p,j+q if (i, j) ∈ C, m = k
               xC,C vi,j =
                                0           otherwise.
The same verification works and therefore xC,C ∈ Zp,q (e).

   Thus we have constructed a set of elements of Zp,q (e) indexed by the set
Ep,q (e). Finally, since they are defined on connected components or pairs of
connected components, they are clearly linearly independant. The proof is
now complete.

Example 2.10. Let us end this section by expliciting the centralizer of the
distinguished nilpotent pair in B3 of the centrally symmetric skew diagram
Γ in Example 1.4. It has in fact a basis given by:

                                                      ∗

          ∗                     ∗     ∗               ∗     ∗

               ∗                      ∗    ∗                ∗


                     ∗

                     ∗

                                                 ∗    ∗

where the “star” boxes denote the corresponding pairs of skew subdiagrams.
Let x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 be the corresponding elements in so7 (from left to
right and top to bottom) defined by x1 v0,−1 = v1,0 , x1 v−1,0 = −v0,1 and
zero otherwise; x2 vi,j = (−1)i+j+1 vi,j+1 , x3 vi,j = (−1)i+j+1 vi+1,j , x4 vi,j =
(−1)i+j+1 vi+2,j−1 , x5 vi,j = (−1)i+j+1 vi−1,j+2 for all (i, j) with vi,j = 0 if
(i, j) 6∈ Γ. A simple verification shows that this is a basis of Z(e).

     3. Description of the positive quadrant via skew diagrams
   Since the sets Ep,q (e)k and Ep,q (e)k,l depend only on the connected skew
diagrams Γk and Γl , we can study it in a combinatorial way. For a skew
diagram Γ, we define
   • Ep,q (Γ) to be the set of skew subdiagrams C in Γ such that C + (p, q)
is a σ-skew subdiagram in Γ.
and for Γ, Γ′ two distinct centrally symmetric skew diagrams, we define
CENTRALIZERS OF DISTINGUISHED NILPOTENT PAIRS AND RELATED PROBLEMS
                                                                 11

   • Ep,q (Γ, Γ′ ) to be the set of pairs of skew subdiagrams (C, C ′ ) such that
C is a skew subdiagram of Γ, C ′ is a skew subdiagram of Γ′ and C + (p, q) =
σ(C ′ ).
   • Ep,q (Γ, Γ) to be the set of subsets of skew subdiagrams {C, C ′ } of Γ
such that C + (p, q) = σ(C ′ ) and if p + q is even, then C 6= C ′ .
   In this section, we are interested in the description of the positive quad-
rant, that is when p, q ≥ 0. Let us fix p, q ≥ 0. Note that if Γ, Γ′ are both
integral or non integral, then p, q ∈ Z.
Lemma 3.1. Let Γ be a skew diagram, then the cardinality of Ep,q (Γ) is the
number of connected components of (Γ − (p, q)) ∩ Γ. In particular E0,0 (Γ) is
of cardinal 1.
Proof. Since p, q ≥ 0, it is clear that a connected component C of (Γ−(p, q))∩
Γ is a skew subdiagram of Γ and that C + (p, q) is a σ-skew subdiagram of
Γ.
   Let Γ be a skew diagram. An element (i, j) ∈ Γ is called a northeast (resp.
southwest) corner if (i + 1, j) and (i, j + 1) (resp. (i − 1, j) and (i, j − 1))
are not in Γ. It is called a northeast (resp. southwest) angle if (i + 1, j + 1)
(resp. (i − 1, j − 1)) is not in Γ but (i + 1, j) and (i, j + 1) (resp. (i − 1, j)
and (i, j − 1)) are in Γ.
   For example, let Γ be the following skew diagram,



                                   (i, j)



then (i, j) is a southwest angle which is also a northeast angle, while (i−1, j)
and (i, j − 1) are southwest corners, and (i + 1, j), (i, j + 1) are northeast
corners.
TheoremS3.2. Let Γ be a skew diagram of cardinal n. Then the cardinal
of the set p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0) Ep,q (Γ) is equal to n − 1.

Proof. First observe that E0,0 (Γ) has cardinal 1.
   By the previous lemma, we are reduced to counting the number of con-
nected components ep,q (Γ) of (Γ − (p, q)) ∩ Γ. We shall proceed by induction
on the cardinality of Γ. The result is trivial if the cardinality of Γ is 1.
   Now let n > 1 be the cardinality of Γ. Let us first suppose that there
exist a northeast corner (i, j) ∈ Γ such that Γ′ = Γ \ {(i, j)} is again a skew
diagram.
   We shall compare the connected components of (Γ′ − (p, q)) ∩ Γ′ and
(Γ−(p, q))∩Γ. Note that the former is obtained from the latter by removing
(i − p, j − q) set-theoretically. It follows by an easy observation that,
12                                       RUPERT W.T. YU

   1. ep,q (Γ′ ) = ep,q (Γ) + 1 if (i, j) − (p, q) is a southwest angle of Γ′ , which
is also a southwest angle of Γ.
   2. ep,q (Γ′ ) = ep,q (Γ) − 1 if (i, j) − (p, q) is a southwest corner of Γ′ , which
is also a southwest corner of Γ.
   3. ep,q (Γ′ ) = ep,q (Γ) otherwise.
     For example to illustrate 1, let Γ be the following skew diagram,

                                           (i, j)




If we remove (i, j) and take (p, q) = (0, 1), then (Γ − (p, q)) ∩ Γ looks like

                                           (k, l)



where (k, l) = (i, j − 1) is a southwest angle of Γ. So when we remove this
box, we recover (Γ′ − (p, q)) ∩ Γ′ and the number of connected components
is increased by 1.
   We are therefore reduced to counting southwest corners and southwest
angles of Γ southwest of (i, j). Let Nc be the number of southwest corners
(k, l) in Γ such that k ≤ i and l ≤ j, and Na the number of southwest angles
(k, l) in Γ such that k ≤ i and l ≤ j. Then it follows from the above that
                X                        X
                         ep,q (Γ) =              ep,q (Γ′ ) + Nc − Na .
           p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0)              p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0)

Now Γ is a skew diagram, so each southwest angle is above a southwest
corner. Further, the leftmost southwest corner is not below any southwest

                       ep,q (Γ) =            ep,q (Γ′ ) + 1 = n − 1.
           p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0)              p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0)

  We are left with the case where removing a northeast corner in Γ gives 2
skew diagrams. This means that Γ is of the form:

                                (i, j)      ···
                                                          ..       ..
                                                               .        .

   Let (i, j) be the leftmost, i.e. i minimal, southwest corner of Γ, and let
Γ′ = Γ \ {(i, j)}. Then it is clear that ep,q (Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ ) if q > 0. Let (i + r, j)

It follows that p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0) ep,q (Γ) = p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0) ep,q (Γ′ ) + 1 = n −
1.
  Let us now turn to the study of Ep,q (Γ, Γ).
Lemma 3.3. Let Γ be a centrally symmetric skew diagram, and let C be an
element of Ep,q (Γ). Set C ′ = σ(C) − (p, q). Then C ′ = C or C ∩ C ′ = ∅.
Proof. First of all, we note that C ′ + (p, q) is a σ-skew subdiagram of Γ,
and since Γ is centrally symmetric, C ′ is a skew subdiagram of Γ. Thus
C ′ ∈ Ep,q (Γ).
   Let us suppose that C ∩ C ′ is non empty and C is not a subset of C ′ .
Then there exists (i, j) ∈ C \ C ′ such that (i − 1, j) or (i, j − 1) is in C ′ . This
is not possible because (i + p, j + q) ∈ Γ \ C ′ + (p, q), while (i − 1 + p, j + q)
or (i + p, j − 1 + q) is in C ′ + (p, q) which, as noted above, is a σ-skew
subdiagram. The lemma now follows.

Remark 3.4. It follows from the previous lemma that Ep,q (Γ) is the disjoint
union of those C such that C = C ′ and subsets {C, C ′ } with C ∩ C ′ = ∅,
where C ′ = σ(C) − (p, q). Further, by central symmetry, there is at most
one C in Ep,q (Γ) such that C = C ′ .

Theorem 3.5. Let Γ be  S a centrally symmetric skew     S diagram of cardinal n,
then the cardinality of p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0) Ep,q (Γ, Γ) = p,q≥0 Ep,q (Γ, Γ) is equal
to [n/2], where [n/2] denotes the integer part of n/2.
Proof. First observe that (C, C ′ ) ∈ E0,0 (Γ, Γ) implies that C = C ′ . But p + q
is even, so E0,0 (Γ, Γ) = ∅.
     We proceed by induction on n as in Theorem 3.2. For n = 1, 2, the result
is clear. Let n > 2 and let (i, j) be the northeast corner of Γ such that i is
minimal. Let ep,q (Γ, Γ) denote the cardinality of Ep,q (Γ, Γ).
     Let us first take care of the case where Γ is rectangular, i.e. Γ has exactly
one southwest corner since Γ is centrally symmetric. Then every C ∈ Ep,q (Γ)
is rectangular and C = σ(C) − (p, q). So we have only to count the number
of p, q’s such that p + q is odd. This is clearly [n/2].
     So let us suppose that Γ is not rectangular.
     Let Γ′ = Γ \ {(i, j), (−i, −j)} and let us suppose that Γ′ is again a skew
diagram.
     We shall use a similar argument as in Theorem 3.2, but since we are
dealing with centrally symmetric skew diagrams, we need to have a detailed
analysis on the induction process.
     Denote by ∆p,q = (Γ − (p, q)) ∩ Γ and ∆′p,q = (Γ′ − (p, q)) ∩ Γ′ . Note that

∆p,q = ∆p,q \ {(−i, −j), (i − p, j − q)}.

  Let C be a connected component of ∆p,q , then we have the following 3
lemmas:
Lemma 3.6. We have C ∩ {(−i, −j), (i − p, j − q)} = ∅ if and only if C is
a connected component of ∆′p,q .

Lemma 3.7. Let C∩{(−i, −j), (i−p, j−q)} = {(i−p, j−q)} and (−i, −j) 6=
(i − p, j − q), then we have C 6= σ(C) − (p, q), (σ(C) − (p, q)) ∩ {(−i, −j), (i −
p, j − q)} = {(−i, −j)} and
  a) C \ {(i − p, j − q)} = ∅ if and only if (i − p, j − q) is a southwest corner
of Γ southwest of (i, j).
  b) C \ {(i − p, j − q)} = C ′ is a connected component of ∆′p,q if and only
if (i − p, j − q) is neither a southwest corner nor a southwest angle of Γ
southwest of (i, j). In particular, σ(C ′ ) − (p, q) 6= C ′ .
  c) C \ {(i − p, j − q)} = C ′ ∪ C ′′ is the disjoint union of two distinct
connected components of ∆′p,q if and only if (i − p, j − q) is a southwest angle
of Γ southwest of (i, j). In particular, σ(C ′ )−(p, q) 6= C ′ , σ(C ′′ )−(p, q) 6= C ′′
and σ(C ′ ) − (p, q) 6= C ′′ .

Lemma 3.8. Let C ∩ {(−i, −j), (i − p, j − q)} = {(−i, −j), (i − p, j − q)},
then C = σ(C) − (p, q) and
  a) C \ {(−i, −j), (i − p, j − q)} = ∅ if and only if either (−i, −j) ∈ {(i −
p, j − q), (i − p − 1, j − q)} or (−i, −j) = (i − p, j − q − 1) and (i − p, j − q)
is not a southwest angle of Γ southwest of (i, j).
  b) C \ {(−i, −j), (i − p, j − q)} = C ′ ∪ C ′′ is the disjoint union of two
distinct connected components of ∆′p,q such that C ′ = σ(C ′′ ) − (p, q) if and
only if either (−i, −j) = (i − p − 1, j − q − 1) or (−i, −j) = (i − p, j − q − 1)
and (i − p, j − q) is a southwest angle of Γ southwest of (i, j).
  c) C \ {(−i, −j), (i − p, j − q)} = C ′ ∪ C ′′ ∪ C ′′′ is the disjoint union of
three distinct connected components of ∆′p,q such that C ′ = σ(C ′′ ) − (p, q)
and C ′′′ = σ(C ′′′ ) − (p, q) if and only if (i − p, j − q) is a southwest angle of
Γ southwest of (i, j) such that −i = i − p and j − q − 1 6= −j.
  d) Otherwise C \ {(−i, −j), (i − p, j − q)} = C ′ is a connected component
of ∆′p,q such that C ′ = σ(C ′ ) − (p, q).
  All three lemmas are easy consequences of Lemma 3.3, of the central
symmetry of Γ and the fact that (i, j) is chosen to be the northeast corner
with i minimal.
  It follows from these three lemmas that ep,q (Γ, Γ) and ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) are equal
unless (p, q) satisfies one of the following conditions:
  1. (i − p, j − q) 6= (−i, −j) is a southwest corner of Γ southwest of (i, j),
in which case ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) + 1 by Lemma 3.7 a).
  2. (i − p, j − q) is a southwest angle of Γ southwest of (i, j) such that
i − p 6= −i, in which case ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) − 1 by Lemma 3.7 c).

   3. (i − p, j − q) is a southwest angle of Γ southwest of (i, j) such that
i − p = −i and j − q 6= −j + 1, in which case ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) − 1 by
Lemma 3.8 b).
   4. (i − p, j − q) = (−i, −j) with i ≥ 0, in which case
       i) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) if 2(i + j) is even by Lemma 3.8 a);
      ii) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ )+1 if 2(i + j) is odd by Lemma 3.8 a).
   5. (i − p, j − q) = (−i + 1, −j + 1) with i > 0, in which case
       i) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) − 1 if 2(i + j) is even by Lemma 3.8 b);
      ii) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) if 2(i + j) is odd by Lemma 3.8 b).
   6. (i − p, j − q) = (−i + 1, −j) with i > 0, in which case
       i) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) + 1 if 2(i + j) is even by Lemma 3.8 a);
      ii) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) if 2(i + j) is odd by Lemma 3.8 a).
   7. (i − p, j − q) = (−i, −j + 1) is a southwest angle of Γ southwest of (i, j),
in which case
       i) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) if 2(i + j) is even by Lemma 3.8 b);
      ii) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) − 1 if 2(i + j) is odd by Lemma 3.8 b).
   8. (i − p, j − q) = (−i, −j + 1) is not a southwest angle of Γ southwest of
(i, j) and i ≥ 0, in which case
       i) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) + 1 if 2(i + j) is even by Lemma 3.8 a);
      ii) ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) if 2(i + j) is odd by Lemma 3.8 a).

  Now if i < 0, then only 1 and 2 apply, thus we deduce as in Theorem 3.2
that            X                 X
                    ep,q (Γ, Γ) =    ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) + Nc − Na
                 p,q≥0             p,q≥0
where Nc (resp. Na ) is the number of southwest corners (resp. angles)
southwest of (i, j).
  Now if i = 0, then 5 and 6 do not apply. We have therefore
             X                   X                X
                   ep,q (Γ, Γ) =    ep,q (Γ, Γ) +   e0,q (Γ, Γ).
              p,q≥0             p>0,q≥0                 q≥0

There are 4 cases: 2(i+j) is even or odd; (−i, −j +1) is or is not a southwest
angle of Γ. By applying 3,4,7 and 8 in the appropriate case, we have that:
                       X                 X
                           e0,q (Γ, Γ) =   e0,q (Γ′ , Γ′ )
                         q≥0               q≥0

since Γ is not rectangular, so there is always a southwest angle above
(−i, −j). It follows that we have again
                  X                 X
                      ep,q (Γ, Γ) =   ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) + Nc − Na .
                 p,q≥0             p,q≥0

Finally if i > 0, then 5 and 6 apply also. Again there are the same 4 cases
to consider, and we deduce that
                     X                     X
                           ep,q (Γ, Γ) =         ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ )

16                                RUPERT W.T. YU

since for these (p, q), ep,q (Γ, Γ) = ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) unless 3,4,5,6,7 or 8 is satisfied
(note that (−i, −j) is the first southwest corner of Γ southwest of (i, j)
because i > 0 and (i, j) is chosen to be the leftmost northeast corner of Γ).
Hence, we have again
                 X                    X
                       ep,q (Γ, Γ) =        ep,q (Γ′ , Γ′ ) + Nc − Na .
                  p,q≥0                   p,q≥0

By induction, we have our result.
   We are therefore left with the case where Γ′ is not connected. In this case,
let (i, j) be the leftmost southwest corner of Γ. Then Γ is of the following
form:


        (i, j)       ···
                                 ..        ..
                                      .            .
                                          ..           ..
                                               .            .

                                                                ···

  A similar argument as in Theorem 3.2 reduces Γ to a horizontal diagram
which is a simple verification.

Theorem 3.9. Let Γ, Γ′ be two centrally
                                     S    symmetric skew diagrams such that
Γ ∩ Γ′ = {(0, 0)} =
                  6 Γ′ . Then Card p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0) Ep,q (Γ, Γ′ ) ≥ 1. Equality
holds if and only if Γ and Γ′ satisfy one of the following two conditions:
   a) Γ = {(0, 0)} and Γ′ has exactly one southwest corner (i, j) such that
i, j ≤ 0;
   b) Γ and Γ′ are both rectangular, i.e. they both have exactly one southwest
corner and one northeast corner.
Proof. Let us first suppose that Γ = {(0, 0)}. Then Γ′ has at least a north-
east corner (p, q) such that p, q ≥ 0, (p, q) 6= (0, 0) since Γ′ is a skew diagram
of cardinal > 1 containing (0, 0). Thus the pair {(0, 0)}, {(−p, −q)} is in
Ep,q (Γ, Γ′ ).
   We can therefore suppose that Γ and Γ′ are skew diagrams of cardinal
> 2 and Γ ∩ Γ′ = {(0, 0)}. There exist p, q > 0 such that, exchanging the
roles of Γ and Γ′ if necessary, (−p, 0) be a southwest corner of Γ and (0, q)
be a northeast corner of Γ′ . By central symmetry, (0, −q) ∈ Γ′ and the
pair {(−p, 0)}, {(0, −q)} is in Ep,q (Γ, Γ′ ). So the first part of the theorem is
proved.

   If Γ = {(0, 0)}, then it is clear that equality holds if and only if condition
a) is satisfied. So we can assume that the cardinality of Γ and Γ′ are > 2.
CENTRALIZERS OF DISTINGUISHED NILPOTENT PAIRS AND RELATED PROBLEMS
                                                                 17

   If they are both rectangular, then one is horizontal and the other vertical.
It is clear that equality holds. Now let Γ be non rectangular and that Γ
contains (−1, 0) (the case Γ contains (0, −1) is similar). Then Γ′ contains
(0, −1).
   Let (0, q) be a northeast corner of Γ′ , then q > 0 and (0, q − 1) ∈ Γ′ . Let
(−p, 0) be a southwest corner of Γ with p > 0. Then either (−p − 1, 1) is
not in Γ or Γ has a southwest corner (−r, 1) with r > 0.
   In the first case, the pair {(−p, 0), (−p, 1)}, {(0, −q), (0, −q + 1)} is in
Ep,q (Γ, Γ′ ). In the second case, the pair (−r, 1), (0, −q) is in Er,q−1 (Γ, Γ′ ).
Since the pair (−p, 0), (0, −q) is in Ep,q (Γ, Γ′ ) in both cases, we are done.

Example 3.10. Let Γ = {(−1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0)} and Γ′ = {(−1, 1), (0, 1),
(0, 0), (0, −1), (1, −1)} be centrally symmetric skew diagrams.



                         (0, 0)                 (0, 0)



Then E1,1 (Γ, Γ′ ) contains the unique pair (−1, 0), (0, −1) and E0,1 (Γ, Γ′ ) con-
tains the unique pair {(−1, 0),S(0, 0)}, {(0, −1), (1, −1)}. One verifies easily
that the cardinality of the set p,q≥0 Ep,q (Γ, Γ′ ) is 2.

Proposition 3.11.SLet Γ, Γ′ be centrally symmetric skew diagrams of dif-
ferent types. Then p,q≥0,(p,q)6=(0,0) Ep,q (Γ, Γ′ ) is non empty.
Proof. A centrally symmetric skew diagram has always a southwest corner
(i, j) such that i, j ≤ 0. Let (i, j) (resp. (k, l)) be such a southwest corner in
Γ (resp. Γ′ ). Then it is clear that the pair (i, j), (k, l) is in E−i−k,−j−l (Γ, Γ′ )
and we are done.

  4. Conditions (Y), (R) and Near rectangular skew diagrams
   Let Γ be a skew diagram (resp. centrally symmetric skew diagram) and
set
             S                                   S
   • E(Γ) := (p,q)∈Z2 Ep,q (Γ) (resp. E(Γ, Γ) := (p,q)∈Z2 Ep,q (Γ, Γ))
                  S                                  S
   • and E+ (Γ) := p,q≥0 Ep,q (Γ) (resp. E+ (Γ, Γ) := p,q≥0 Ep,q (Γ, Γ)).
   From the previous section, we have that Card E+ (Γ) = Card Γ − 1 (resp.
Card E+ (Γ, Γ) = [Card Γ/2]). In this section, we shall study skew dia-
grams (resp. centrally symmetric skew diagrams) such that the cardinal-
ity of E(Γ) (resp. E(Γ, Γ)) is less than or equal to 1 + Card E+ (Γ). (resp.
1 + Card E+ (Γ, Γ)).
Definition 4.1. We say that a skew diagram Γ satisfies (Y) if it has either
exactly 1 southwest corner or exactly 1 northeast corner.
18                               RUPERT W.T. YU

   So in the terminology of [2], Γ satisfies (Y) if and only if Γ is a Young
diagram or a minus Young diagram, while in the terminology of [1], this is
equivalent to that Γ is either sw-Young or ne-Young.
Proposition 4.2. Let Γ be a skew diagram. Then
 a) E(Γ) = E+ (Γ) if and only if Γ satisfies (Y).
 b) if Γ does not satisfy (Y), then Card E(Γ) ≥ 2 + Card E+ (Γ).
Proof. First note that Γ has exactly one southwest corner is equivalent to
σ(Γ) has exactly one northeast corner, and that if C ∈ Ep,q (Γ), then σ(C) −
(p, q) ∈ Ep,q (σ(Γ)). So we can suppose that Γ has exactly one southwest
corner (i, j). Now any skew subdiagram of Γ contains (i, j). So Ep,q (Γ) is
empty if p < 0 or q < 0, and the “if” part follows.
   Now suppose that Γ does not satisfy (Y), and therefore there are at least
2 southwest corners and at least 2 northeast corners. Let the bottom row
of Γ be (i, j), · · · , (i + r, j) and the top row of Γ be (k, l), · · · , (k + s, l)
where r, s ≥ 0. Then Γ does not satisfy (Y) implies that k < i, j < l and
i + r > k + s.
   Now let t = min(r, s), then k + s − t < i. It follows that the skew
diagram {(i, j), · · · , (i + t, j)} is in Ek+s−t−i,l−j (Γ). So part a) follows since
k + s − t − i < 0.
   Finally, if Γ does not satisfy (Y), then the above can also be applied to
the leftmost column and the rightmost column. Thus b) follows.

Definition 4.3. A centrally symmetric skew diagram Γ is called near rect-
angular if it has exactly 2 southwest corners (i, j), (k, l) with i < k such
that one of the following conditions is satisfied:
 a) Γ \ {(i, j), (−i, −j)} is rectangular;
 b) Γ \ {(k, l), (−k, −l)} is rectangular;
 c) (i, j) = (k − 1, l + 1).
     Their standard forms are illustrated as follows:



                · · ·                 · · ·                 · · ·
                · · ·                 · · ·                 · · ·
                · · ·                 · · ·                 · · ·




                 a)                    b)                     c)
  We say that a skew diagram Γ satisfies (R) if either Γ is rectangular or
Γ is non integral and near rectangular.

Proposition 4.4. Let Γ be a centrally symmetric skew diagram.                  Then
E(Γ, Γ) = E+ (Γ, Γ) if and only if Γ satisfies (R).
Proof. Let us suppose that Γ satisfies (R). If Γ is rectangular, then we have
our result by Proposition 4.2. So let us suppose that Γ is near rectangular
with southwest corners (i, j), (k, l) with i < k.
   If Γ satisfies condition a) of Definition 4.3, then k = i + 1 and l = −j.
We observe that we have only to find a necessary and sufficient condition
for {(i, j)} to be in E−2i,−2j (Γ, Γ) or {(i + 1, −j), · · · , (−i, −j)} to be in
E−1,2j (Γ, Γ). This is so if and only if 2(i + j) or 2j − 1 is odd. But this is
equivalent to saying that Γ is not non integral.
   If Γ satisfies condition b) of Definition 4.3, then a similar argument gives
our result.
   Now if Γ satisfies condition c) of Definition 4.3, then (k, l) = (i + 1, j − 1).
We now have to find a necessary and sufficient condition for {(i, j), · · · (i, −j+
1)} to be in E−2i,−1 (Γ, Γ) or {(i+1, j−1), · · · , (−i, j−1)} to be in E−1,−2j+2 (Γ, Γ).
This is so if and only if 2i + 1 or 2j + 1 is odd. Again this is equivalent to
saying that Γ is not non integral.
   We have therefore proved the “if” part.
   To prove the “only if” part, it suffices therefore to prove that if E(Γ, Γ) =
E+ (Γ, Γ), then Γ is either rectangular or near rectangular.
   Let (i, j), · · · , (i + r, j) be the top row of Γ with −i, j, r ≥ 0, then (−i −
r, −j), · · · , (−i, −j) is the bottom row of Γ. Note that i ≤ −i − r since
Γ is a skew diagram. If r ≥ 1, then either {(−i − r, −j), · · · , (−i, −j)} is
in E2i+r,2j (Γ, Γ) or {(−i − r, j), · · · , (−i − 1, j)} is in E2i+r+1,2j (Γ, Γ) since
either 2i + r + 2j or 2i + r + 2j + 1 is odd. So it follows that if r ≥ 1, then
Ep,q (Γ, Γ) is non empty for some p, q with p < 0, q > 0 if 2i + r + 1 < 0, or
equivalently, i + 1 < −i − r.
   Now let (k, l), · · · , (k, l + s) = (i, j) be the leftmost column of Γ with
−k, −l, s ≥ 0, then (−k, −l − s), · · · , (−k, −l) is the rightmost column of Γ.
Note that l ≥ −l − s since Γ is a skew diagram. A similar argument shows
that if s ≥ 1, then Ep,q (Γ, Γ) is non empty for some p, q with q < 0, p > 0 if
−l − s < l − 1.
   We are therefore left with four possibilities: r = 0 and s = 0; r = 0 and
s > 0; r > 0 and s = 0; r > 0 and s > 0.
   In the first case, we have that Γ = {(0, 0)} which is rectangular and the
result follows.
   In the second case, we have that l − 1 ≤ −l − s. Since l ≥ −l − s, we have
either l = −l − s or l − 1 = −l − s. If l = −l − s, then Γ is just a vertical
diagram which is rectangular. If l − 1 = −l − s, then Γ is near rectangular
satisfying condition b) of Definition 4.3.
   The third case is similar to the second yielding condition a) of Definition
4.3. The last case implies that either l = −l − s, i = −i − r or l − 1 = −l − s,
i + 1 = −i − r. In the former, Γ is rectangular. In the latter, Γ is near
rectangular satisfying condition c) of Definition 4.3.
   Our proposition now follows.

Proposition 4.5. Let Γ be a centrally symmetric skew diagram. Then
Card E(Γ, Γ) = 1 + Card E+ (Γ, Γ) if and only if one of the following con-
ditions is satisfied:
  i) Γ is semi-integral and near rectangular;
 ii) Γ is integral and near rectangular of type a) or b).

Proof. The “if” part is just a direct verification using the computations in
the proof of Proposition 4.4. Let us show why type c) is not allowed for Γ
integral and leave the other verifications to the reader. Let Γ be integral and
near rectangular and (i, j), (i+1, j −1) be the two distinct southwest corners
with i < k. Then 2i + 1 and 2j + 1 are both odd, so by the computations
in the proof of Proposition 4.4, there are 2 elements of E(Γ, Γ) which are
not in E+ (Γ, Γ). Note that if Γ is near rectangular and non integral, then
E(Γ, Γ) = E+ (Γ, Γ).
   To prove the “only if” part, it suffices to prove that if Card E(Γ, Γ) =
1 + Card E+ (Γ, Γ), then Γ is near rectangular. Let us suppose that Γ is not
near rectangular.
   Let (i, j), · · · , (i + r, j) be the top row of Γ with −i, j, r ≥ 0, then (−i −
r, −j), · · · , (−i, −j) is the bottom row of Γ. Note that i ≤ −i − r since Γ is
a skew diagram.
   Let (k, l), · · · , (k, l + s) = (i, j) be the leftmost column of Γ with −k, −l,
s ≥ 0, then (−k, −l − s), · · · , (−k, −l) is the rightmost column of Γ. Note
that l ≥ −l − s since Γ is a skew diagram.
   Recall from the proof of Proposition 4.4 that if r ≥ 1 and i + 1 < −i − r,
then Ep,q (Γ, Γ) is non empty for some p, q with p < 0, q > 0; and if s ≥ 1
and −l − s < l − 1, then Ep,q (Γ, Γ) is non empty for some p, q with p > 0,
q < 0.
   As in Proposition 4.4, we have four cases to consider: r = s = 0; r = 0,
s > 0; s = 0, r > 0; r, s > 0.
   In the first case, Γ is rectangular. So Card E(Γ, Γ) = Card E+ (Γ, Γ).
   In the second case, if s = −2l, then Γ is rectangular and Card E(Γ, Γ) =
Card E+ (Γ, Γ). Since Γ is not near rectangular, −l − s < l − 1 and k < 0. So
Ep,q (Γ, Γ) is non empty for some p, q with p > 0 and q < 0 if −l − s < l − 1.
   Let (u, v) be a southwest corner distinct from (k, l) and (−i, −j). Then
clearly, i = k < u < −i. It follows that {(u, v)}, {(−i, −j)} is a pair in
Ei−u,j−v (Γ, Γ). Therefore Card E(Γ, Γ) ≥ Card E+ (Γ, Γ) + 2.
   So let us assume that (k, l) and (−i, −j) are the only southwest corners
of Γ. Then since −l − s < l − 1, (k + 1, l + s − 1) 6∈ Γ and by central
symmetry (−i − 1, −j + 1) 6∈ Γ; otherwise, (−i − 1, −j + 1) is a southwest
corner distinct from (k, l) and (−i, −j). It follows that either {(−i, −j)} is
in Ek+i,l+s+j (Γ, Γ) or {(−i, −j), (−i, −j + 1)} is in Ek+i,l+s+j−1(Γ, Γ), where
k + i < 0. Thus Card E(Γ, Γ) ≥ Card E+ (Γ, Γ) + 2.
   The third case is similar to the second. Finally, in the last case, we have
either i + 1 ≥ −i − r, −l − s < l − 1 or i + 1 < −i − r, −l − s ≥ l − 1. Without
loss of generality, we can assume that i + 1 ≥ −i − r, −l − s < l − 1. Then
CENTRALIZERS OF DISTINGUISHED NILPOTENT PAIRS AND RELATED PROBLEMS
                                                                 21

i + r = −i or i + r = −i − 1. Since −l − s < l − 1, Γ is not rectangular and
therefore we can not have i + r = −i. So i + r = −i − 1 and Γ has exactly
two southwest corners (k, l) = (i, j − s) and (k + 1, −l − s) = (i + 1, −j).
   Now Ep,q (Γ, Γ) is non empty for some p, q with p > 0 and q < 0 since
−l − s < l − 1. Further, −l − s < l − 1 implies that (i, −j + 1) 6∈ Γ,
therefore the rectangular diagram formed by the bottom two rows {(i +
1, −j), · · · , (−i, −j), (i + 1, −j + 1), · · · , (−i, −j + 1)} is a skew subdiagram
of Γ. It follows that either the bottom row {(i + 1, −j), · · · , (−i, −j)} is in
Ek−i−1,l+s+j (Γ, Γ) or {(i + 1, −j), · · · , (−i, −j), (i + 1, −j + 1), · · · , (−i, −j +
1)} is in Ek−i−1,l+s−1+j (Γ, Γ) where k − i − 1 = −1 < 0. Again we conclude
that Card E(Γ, Γ) ≥ Card E+ (Γ, Γ) + 2.
   We have therefore proved that if Γ is not near rectangular, then we have
Card E(Γ, Γ) 6= Card E+ (Γ, Γ) + 1. Our proposition now follows.

                          5. Panyushev’s conjecture
  We shall now apply the results of the previous sections to answer Panyu-
shev’s conjecture which states that distinguished nilpotent pairs are won-
derful.                                   L
  Let us denote by Z+ (e) the direct sum p,q≥0 Zp,q (e).

Theorem 5.1. The dimension of the positive quadrant Z+ (e) is greater
than or equal to the rank of g. Equality holds if and only if one of the
following conditions is satisfied:
  a) g is of type A;
  b) g is of type B and the associated pair of centrally symmetric skew dia-
grams (see Theorem 1.5) (Γ1 , Γ2 ) satisfies Γ2 = ∅.
  c) g is of type C and the associated pair of centrally symmetric skew dia-
grams (see Theorem 1.5) (Γ1 , Γ2 ) satisfies Γ1 = ∅ or Γ2 = ∅.
  d) g is of type D and the associated triple of centrally symmetric skew
diagrams (see Theorem 1.5) (Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ3 ) is such that either Γ2 = Γ3 = ∅ or
Γ1 is empty and the pair (Γ2 , Γ3 ) satisfies the conditions a) or b) of Theorem
3.9.
Proof. This is a direct consequence of the Theorem 2.9, Theorems 3.2, 3.5,
3.9 and Proposition 3.11.


             L [3] Recall that a nilpotent pair e = (e1 , e2 ) is called won-
Definition 5.2.
derful if dim p,q∈Z,p,q≥0 Zp,q (e) = rk g.
  It follows from Theorems 2.9, 3.2, 3.5 and 3.9 that:
Corollary 5.3. A distinguished nilpotent pair e in a classical simple Lie
algebra g is wonderful if and only if one of the following conditions is satis-
fied:
  a) g is of type A,B or C;
22                               RUPERT W.T. YU

  b) g is of type D and the associated triples of centrally symmetric skew
diagrams (see Theorem 1.5) (Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ3 ) is such that the pair (Γ2 , Γ3 ) satisfies
the conditions a) or b) of Theorem 3.9.
Proof. It suffices to observe that Proposition 3.11 does not apply here since
we are only interested in p, q ∈ Z.
   So distinguished nilpotent pairs are always wonderful in types A, B and
C, but they are not so in type D. Therefore Panyushev’s conjecture is not
true in type D.
Example 5.4. An example of a distinguished nilpotent pair which is not
wonderful is the one described in Example 3.10 which corresponds to a dis-
tinguished nilpotent pair in D4 . One verifies easily that the positive quadrant
has dimension 5.

 6. Classification of principal and almost principal nilpotent
                               pairs
  By applying the Theorem 5.1 and Propositions 4.2, 4.4, we recover easily
the classification of principal nilpotent pairs.
Corollary 6.1. Let e be a distinguished nilpotent pair in a classical simple
Lie algebra g. Then dim Z(e) = rk g if and only if
  a) g is of type A and the associated skew diagram Γ satisfies (Y);
  b) g is of type B and the associated pair of centrally symmetric skew dia-
grams (Γ1 , ∅) satisfies (R);
  c) g is of type C and the associated pair of centrally symmetric skew dia-
grams (Γ1 , ∅) (resp. (∅, Γ2 )) satisfies (R);
  d) g is of type D and the associated triples of centrally symmetric skew
diagrams (∅, Γ2 , Γ3 ) (resp. (Γ1 , ∅, ∅)) satisfies (R).
   The above corollary is exactly the classification of principal nilpotent pairs
in classical simple Lie algebra given in [1].
Remark 6.2. Note that there exist non principal distinguished nilpotent
pairs satisfying Z(e) = Z+ (e). By the results of Sections 3 and 4, such
a nilpotent pair must be of type other than A and the corresponding skew
diagrams must all satisfy (R).
   For example, in type B and C, take any pair (Γ1 , Γ2 ) such that they are
both non empty and rectangular. Then one can verify easily that Z(e) =
Z+ (e).
   Also in type B, take any pair (Γ1 , Γ2 ) such that Γ1 is rectangular with
southwest corner (i, j) and Γ2 is near rectangular satisfying for all (k, l) ∈
Γ2 , we have k > i, l > j, then again one can verify easily that Z(e) = Z+ (e).
     We now turn to the classification of almost principal nilpotent pairs.
Definition 6.3. Recall that a nilpotent pair e is called almost principal
if dim Z(e) = rk g + 1.
CENTRALIZERS OF DISTINGUISHED NILPOTENT PAIRS AND RELATED PROBLEMS
                                                                 23

  It is shown in [4] that almost principal nilpotent pairs are distinguished
and wonderful. Therefore the number of G-orbits of almost principal nilpo-
tent pairs is finite.
Theorem 6.4. Let g be of type A or D, then there are no almost principal
nilpotent pairs.
Proof. For type A, this is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.9 and Propo-
sition 4.2.
   So let us suppose that g is of type D, and let (Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ3 ) be the corre-
sponding triple of centrally symmetric skew diagram. If they are all non
empty, then by Proposition
                    S        3.11, E+ (Γ1 , Γ2 ) and E+ (Γ1 , Γ3 ) are not empty
where E+ (Γ , Γ ) = p,q≥0 Ep,q (Γ1 , Γi ). So Card Z(e) ≥ rk g + 2.
             1  i

   If Γ2 = Γ3 = ∅, then since Γ1 is non integral, Card Z(e) 6= rk g + 1 by
Proposition 4.5.
   Finally, suppose that Γ1 = ∅. Then the condition Card Z(e) = rk g + 1
would imply that by
        Card E(Γ2 , Γ2 ) + Card E(Γ3 , Γ3 ) + Card E(Γ2 , Γ3 ) = rk g + 1
                     S
where E(Γ2 , Γ3 ) = (p,q)∈Z2 Ep,q (Γ2 , Γ3 ). So by Corollary 6.1, we deduce
that either Γ2 or Γ3 does not satisfy (R). Without loss of generality, we can
suppose that Γ2 does not satisfy (R). Thus we have by Theorem 3.5 and
Proposition 4.4 that
 Card E(Γ2 , Γ2 ) = 1 + Card E+ (Γ2 , Γ2 ), Card E(Γ3 , Γ3 ) = Card E+ (Γ3 , Γ3 ),
                             Card E(Γ2 , Γ3 ) = 1. (∗)
Since Γ2 is integral, this means that it has at least two distinct southwest
corners (i, j), (k, l). Let (r, s) be a southwest corner of Γ3 . Then the pairs
{(i, j)}, {(r, s)} and {(k, l)}, {(r, s)} are in E(Γ2 , Γ3 ). Hence, Card E(Γ2 , Γ3 ) ≥
2 which contradicts (∗).

Remark 6.5. In [4], it is shown that there are no almost principal nilpotent
pairs for g = E6 , E7 , E8 or F4 and it is suggested that almost principal
nilpotent pairs do not exist in the simply-laced case. It is now clear by
Theorem 6.4 that:

Corollary 6.6. Almost principal nilpotent pairs do not exist in the simply-
laced case.
  This is rather strange and it would be nice to have a more natural expla-
nation.
Theorem 6.7. Let g be of type Bn . Then there is a one-to-one correspon-
dence between the set of conjugacy classes of almost principal nilpotent pairs
and the set of pairs of centrally symmetric skew diagrams (Γ1 , Γ2 ) satisfying:
 a) Card Γ1 + Card Γ2 = 2n + 1.
 b) Γ1 is integral and Γ2 is non integral.
24                               RUPERT W.T. YU

     c) We have either
        i) Γ1 is near rectangular of type a) or b) and Γ2 = ∅;
       ii) or Γ1 = {(0, 0)} and Γ2 is rectangular.
Proof. Let e be an almost principal nilpotent pair, and let (Γ1 , Γ2 ) be the
associated pair of skew diagrams as given in Theorem 1.5. We have 2 cases:
     1. Γ1 or Γ2 is empty;
     2. Γ1 and Γ2 are both non-empty.

    In the first case, by Proposition 4.5, we have condition c)i). Let us show
that in the second case, we have c)ii). So let us assume that Γ1 and Γ2 are
both non-empty.
    By Theorem 3.5 and Proposition 3.11, we must have Card E(Γ1 , Γ2 ) = 1
and both Γ1 and Γ2 must be rectangular for otherwise one of them will have
two distinct southwest corners and one can use the argument in the proof
of Theorem 6.4 for type D to obtain a contradiction.
    Now if C1 (resp. C2 ) is a skew subdiagram of Γ1 (resp. Γ2 ) such that C1
and C2 are of the same shape, then one sees easily from the fact that the
Γi ’s are centrally symmetric that the pair (C1 , C2 ) is in E(Γ1 , Γ2 ). It follows
that if Card E(Γ1 , Γ2 ) = 1, then there is only one such pair. Now Γ2 is non
integral, therefore Γ2 contains the square {±1/2, ±1/2}, hence Γ1 and Γ2
must satisfy condition c)ii).
    Finally, given (Γ1 , Γ2 ) satisfying a), b) and c). It is clear that the corre-
sponding distinguished nilpotent pair is almost principal.

Theorem 6.8. Let g be of type Cn . Then there is a one-to-one correspon-
dence between the set of conjugacy classes of almost principal nilpotent pairs
and the set of pairs of centrally symmetric skew diagrams (Γ1 , Γ2 ) satisfying:
  a) Card Γ1 + Card Γ2 = 2n.
  b) Γ1 ⊂ Z2 + (0, 1/2) and Γ2 ⊂ Z2 + (1/2, 0).
  c) We have either
     i) Γ1 is near rectangular and Γ2 = ∅ or vice versa;
    ii) or Γ1 and Γ2 are both (non-empty) rectangular with Γ1 ⊂ {0} × (Z +
1/2) and Γ2 ⊂ (Z + 1/2) × {0}.
Proof. The proof is similar to the one for type B. The only difference is that
Γ1 and Γ2 are semi-integral which gives condition c)ii).

          7. Centralizer of almost principal nilpotent pairs
   In [4], almost principal nilpotent pairs satisfying condition c)i) (resp. con-
dition c)ii)) of Theorem 6.7 or Theorem 6.8 are called of Z-type (resp. non-
Z-type). He proved that the centralizer of an almost nilpotent pair of non-
Z-type is abelian and suggested the same to be true for an almost nilpotent
pair of Z-type. We shall prove in this section that this is indeed true.
CENTRALIZERS OF DISTINGUISHED NILPOTENT PAIRS AND RELATED PROBLEMS
                                                                 25

Proposition 7.1. Let e be a distinguished nilpotent pair in a classical sim-
ple Lie algebra g. Then there exists an abelian subalgebra in Z+ (e)int of
dimension rk g.
Proof. Let Γ be a skew diagram (resp. centrally symmetric) and C ∈ Ep,q (Γ)
(resp. (C, C e ∈ Ep,q (Γ, Γ)), C ′ ∈ Ep′ ,q′ (Γ) where p, q, p′ , q ′ ≥ 0 (resp. (C ′ , Ce′ ∈
Ep,q (Γ, Γ)).
    Let (i, j) ∈ C be such that (i, j) + (p, q) ∈ C ′ (resp. ∈ C              e ′ ), then by
the definition of a skew subdiagram and the fact that p, q ≥ 0, we have
(i, j) ∈ C ′ (resp. ∈ Ce ′ ).
    Now let Γ, Γ e be integral centrally symmetric skew diagrams such that
      e
Γ ∩ Γ = {(0, 0} and Γ   e 6= {(0, 0)}. By the proof of Theorem 3.9, there exists
a pair (C, C) e ∈ Ep,q (Γ, Γ),
                             e p, q ≥ 0 such that C = {(i, j)} and C           e = {(k, l)}
are southwest corners of Γ and Γ      e respectively. Thus neither (i, j) + (p, q)
or (k, l) + (p, q) is contained in C ′ or C    e′ for any pair (C ′ , C  e′ ) ∈ E+ (Γ, Γ) ∪
     e Γ).
E+ (Γ,  e
    Now one verifies easily from Theorem 2.9 that the subalgebra spanned by
the elements xC or xC,C ′ where
  Type A – C ∈ E+ (Γ) \ E0,0 (Γ),
  Types B or C – (C, C ′ ) ∈ E+ (Γ1 , Γ1 ) ∪ E+ (Γ2 , Γ2 ),
  Type D – (C, C ′ ) ∈ E+ (Γ1 , Γ1 ) ∪ E+ (Γ2 , Γ2 ) ∪ E+ (Γ3 , Γ3 ) and the pair in
E+ (Γ2 , Γ3 ) as given in the proof of Theorem 3.9 which was described above,
form an abelian subalgebra of Z(e). By Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.5, its
dimension is rk g.

Theorem 7.2. Let e be an almost princiapl nilpotent pair in a classical
simple Lie algebra g. Then Z+ (e) is abelian.
Proof. By the classification (Theorems 6.4, 6.7 and 6.8) and Proposition 7.1,
this is just a straightforward case by case computation.
