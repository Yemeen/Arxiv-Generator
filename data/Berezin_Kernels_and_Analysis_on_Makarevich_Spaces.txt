                                                    Dedicated to Gerrit van Dijk on the occasion of his 65-th birthday

                                                    Abstract. Following ideas of van Dijk and Hille we study the
                                                    link which exists between maximal degenerate representations and
                                                    Berezin kernels.

                                                       We consider the conformal group Conf(V ) of a simple real Jor-
                                                    dan algebra V . The maximal degenerate representations πs (s ∈ C)
                                                    we shall study are induced by a character of a maximal parabolic
                                                    subgroup P̄ of Conf(V ). These representations πs can be realized
                                                    on a space Is of smooth functions on V . There is an invariant
                                                    bilinear form Bs on the space Is . The problem we consider is to
                                                    diagonalize this bilinear form Bs , with respect to the action of a
                                                    symmetric subgroup G of the conformal group Conf(V ). This bilin-
                                                    ear form can be written as an integral involving the Berezin kernel
                                                    Bν , an invariant kernel on the Riemannian symmetric space G/K,
                                                    which is a Makarevich symmetric space in the sense of Bertram.
                                                    Then we can use results by van Dijk and Pevzner who computed
                                                    the spherical Fourier transform of Bν . From these, one deduces
                                                    that the Berezin kernel satisfies a remarkable Bernstein identity :
                                                                           D(ν)Bν = b(ν)Bν+1 ,
                                                    where D(ν) is an invariant differential operator on G/K and b(ν) is
                                                    a polynomial. By using this identity we compute a Hua type inte-
                                                    gral which gives the normalizing factor for an intertwining operator
                                                    from I−s to Is . Furthermore we obtain the diagonalization of the
                                                    invariant bilinear form with respect to the action of the maximal
                                                    compact group U of the conformal group Conf(V ).

          1. Berezin kernels on Makarevich Spaces
  In this section we shall introduce the notion of a Berezin kernel on
a symmetric space of a particular type by mean of Jordan algebraic
methods.

1.1. Jordan algebras and their conformal groups. A finite di-
mensional vector space V on R or C is a Jordan algebra if it is endowed
with a bilinear map (x, y) → xy from V × V into V satisfying the two
following axioms:
      • (J1) xy = yx, ∀x, y ∈ V ,
      • (J2) x(x2 y) = x2 (xy), x, y ∈ V .
Let L(x) ∈ End(V ) denote for every x ∈ V the linear map defined by
L(x)y = xy for every y ∈ V .
   Let r and n denote respectively the rank and the dimension of the
Jordan algebra V . For a regular element x, the minimal polynomial fx
is of degree r,
              fx (λ) = λr − a1 (x)λr−1 + · · · + (−1)r ar (x).
The coefficient aj is a homogeneous polynomial of degree j, ∆(x) =
ar (x) is the Jordan polynomial, and tr (x) = a1 (x) is the Jordan trace
of x. (See [13] p.28 for more details).
   Define the so-called quadratic representation of V by:
                  P (x) = 2L(x)2 − L(x2 ),        x ∈ V.
                                       r
One checks that ∆(x)2 = det(P (x)) , where P (x) is seen as an endo-
                                       n

morphism of V .
   A real Jordan algebra V is said to be semi-simple if the bilinear form
Tr L(xy) is non degenerate on V , such an algebra is unital. Furthermore
it is called Euclidean if the above bilinear form is positive definite.
   An involutive automorphism α of V is called Euclidean if the bilinear
form Tr L(α(x)y) is positive definite on V . For a semi-simple Jordan
algebra such a Euclidean involution always exists.
   Assume from now on that V is a simple real Jordan algebra. Accord-
ing to the general construction of Kantor-Köcher-Tits one associates
to V a simple Lie group which can be understood as a group of con-
formal transformations of the corresponding Jordan algebra (in a sense
we shall explain).
   Let us remind this classical construction. The structure group Str(V )
of V can be defined as the subgroup of GL(V ) of elements g such that
        BEREZIN KERNELS AND ANALYSIS ON MAKAREVICH SPACES             3

there exists a real number χ(g) for which
(1.1)               ∆(g.x) = χ(g)∆(x),        x ∈ V.
The map g → χ(g) is a character of Str(V ) which is a reductive Lie
group.
   The Jordan algebra V can be identified with the abelian group N
of its own translations via the map y −→ ny from V to N, where
ny (x) = x + y, ∀x ∈ V . The conformal group Conf(V ) (or the Kantor-
Köcher-Tits group) of the Jordan algebra V is the group of rational
transformations of V generated by translations, elements in Str(V )
and the inversion map j : x −→ −x−1 . It is a simple Lie group. A
transformation g ∈ Conf(V ) is conformal in the sense that, at each
point x, where g is well defined, its differential (Dg)x belongs to the
structure group Str(V ).
   The subgroup of all affine conformal transformations P = Str(V )⋉N
is a maximal parabolic subgroup of Conf(V ). Let σ be the involution
of Conf(V ) given by
                  σ(g) = j ◦ g ◦ j,      g ∈ Conf(V ),
where j ∈ Conf(V ) is the inversion map. We define N = σ(N) and
P := Str(V ) ⋉ N.
   From the geometric point of view the subgroup P can be character-
ized in the following way:
                   P = {g ∈ Conf(V )′ | g(0) = 0},
where Conf(V )′ is the subset of Conf(V ) of all conformal transforma-
tions well defined at 0 ∈ V . It is open and dense in Conf(V ). More-
over Conf(V )′ = N Str(V )N. The map N × Str(V ) × N −→ Conf(V )′
is a diffeomorphism. We shall refer to this decomposition as to the
Gelfand-Naimark decomposition of the conformal group. Furthermore,
for every transformation g ∈ Conf(V ) which is well defined at x ∈ V ,
the transformation gnx belongs to Conf(V )′ and its Gelfand-Naimark
decomposition is given by :
(1.2)                     gnx = ng.x (Dg)x n̄′ ,
where (Dg)x ∈ Str(V ) is the differential of the conformal map x → g.x
at x and n̄′ ∈ N (see [21] Prop. 1.4).

   The flag variety M = Conf(V )/P , which is compact, is the con-
formal compactification of V . In fact the map x −→ (nx ◦ j)P gives
rise to an embedding of V into M as an open dense subset, and every
transformation in Conf(V ) extends to M.

  The Euclidean involution α of V introduced above also defines an
involution θ of Conf(V ) by:

(1.3)                       θ(g) = α ◦ j ◦ g ◦ j ◦ α.

It turns out that θ is a Cartan involution of Conf(V ) (see [21] Prop.
1.1). So the fix points subgroup of θ : U = Conf(V )θ is a maximal
compact subgroup of Conf(V ).
   Let us remind that a simple real Jordan algebra is either a real
form of a simple complex Jordan algebra or a simple complex Jordan
algebra considered as a real one. We conclude this section with the
classification of simple Jordan algebras, together with their conformal
groups and maximal compact subgroups U.

  We shall refer to the Jordan algebras given in the first and forth
columns as to the non split case, and to those of the second and third
columns as to the split case.


1.2. Makarevich Riemannian Symmetric Spaces. A Makarevich
symmetric space is a reductive symmetric space which can be realized
as an open symmetric orbit in the conformal compactification M of a
simple real Jordan algebra V . We refer the reader to [3, 4] and literature
        BEREZIN KERNELS AND ANALYSIS ON MAKAREVICH SPACES                5

cited there for a detailed description. We shall concentrate our inter-
est on Makarevich symmetric spaces carrying an invariant Riemannian
metric.
   Let α be as previously a Euclidean involution of the Jordan algebra
V and let
        V0 := {x ∈ V | α(x) = x},    V1 := {x ∈ V | α(x) = −x},
be the corresponding eigenspaces of α on V . Notice that the set V0 is a
Euclidean Jordan algebra, whose dimension and rank will be denoted
by n0 and r0 . This fact implies that the interior Ω0 of the set {x2 | x ∈
V0 } of ”positive” elements in V0 is a symmetric cone in V0 . Notice that
r = r0 in the split case and r = 2r0 in the non split case. The Jordan
algebra W = V0 + iV1 is a Euclidean real form of the complexification
V C = V + iV . We will denote by Ω the symmetric cone of W . If V is
a simple Jordan algebra of type I, II, or III, then W is simple, while,
if V is of type IV, W ≃ V0 × V0 .
  According to [3] one introduces two groups:
G := {g ∈ Conf(V ) | (−α)◦g ◦(−α) = g}o, and K := {g ∈ G | g.e = e},
where the subscript o stands as usually for the connected component of
the identity transformation and e denotes the identity element of the
Jordan algebra V . It follows that K is a maximal compact subgroup
of G. Moreover, the associated Riemannian symmetric space is a real
tube domain:
(1.4)                    X := G/K = Ω0 + V1 .
   The set X is a Riemannian Makarevich symmetric space. We shall
refer to the previous description as to the tube realization of X .

   Such a Riemannian Makarevich symmetric space can be obtained as
a real form of a Hermitian symmetric space of tube type. The transform
                       x 7→ u = (x − e)(x + e)−1 .
maps the symmetric space X onto a bounded domain D, which is the
unit ball in V with respect to a so-called spectral norm. Its inverse is
the Cayley transform
                 c : u 7→ x = c(u) = (e + u)(e − u)−1 .

  If V is a Euclidean Jordan algebra, then V0 = {0}, and X is a
symmetric cone. If V has a complex structure, then X is a Hermitian
symmetric tube.

Example 1. Let V = M(m, R), the space of m × m real matrices,
be equipped with the Jordan product x ◦ y = 21 (xy + yx). Then the
Jordan determinant coincides with the usual matrix determinant :
∆(x) = det
          x. The structure group Str(V ) is the group S GL(m, R) ×
GL(m, R) , acting on V by
                                                   
                 x 7→ g1 xg2−1 g1 , g2 ∈ GL(m, R) .
The conformal group Conf(V ) is the group SL(2m, R)/{±I} acting on
V by
                                                  
                                  −1           a b
            x 7→ (ax + b)(cx + d)     if g =         .
                                               c d
   The differential of a conformal transformation g is given by (Dg)x y =
h1 (x)yh2 (x), where, under the condition that det c 6= 0,
          h1 (x) = (ac−1 d − b)(cx + d)−1 c, h2 (x) = (cx + d)−1 .
      BEREZIN KERNELS AND ANALYSIS ON MAKAREVICH SPACES                7
                                            
            −1                         a b
Since det(ac d − b) det c = det                  = 1 we finally get:
                                       c d
                         χ ((Dg)x ) = det(cx + d)−2 .
The Euclidean involution α on V = M(m, R) is given by the usual
matrix transposition : α(x) = xT , and
                  V0 = Symm (R), V1 = Skewm (R).
Remind that an element g ∈ Conf(V ) belongs to the group G if and
only if
                         g ◦ (−α) = (−α) ◦ g.
If g.x = (ax + b)(cx + d)−1 , the above condition on g to be in G leads
to
            (xcT + dT )(−ax + b) = −(xaT + bT )(−cx + d),
or equivalently,
                   aT c + cT a = 0,     bT d + dT b = 0,
and, for every x ∈ V ,
                     x(aT + dcT b) = (dT a + bT c)x.
By Schur’s lemma this last condition says that there is λ ∈ R such that
aT d + cT b = λIdm .
  Define the matrix                       
                                  0 Idm
                        Υ=                   .
                                Idm 0
Then the element g belongs to G if and only if g T Υg = λΥ. Since
det g = 1, it follows that λ2m = 1, and since G is connected, λ = 1.
   Finally we have shown that G = SOo(Υ)/ ± Id, where SO(Υ) stands
for the special orthogonal group of the quadratic form defined by the
matrix Υ which has signature (m, m). Therefore G ≃ SOo (m, m)/±Id.

 The conformal compactification M of V is the Grassmann manifold
M = Gr(2m, m) of m-dimensional vector subspaces in R2m .

   The corresponding Riemannian Makarevich symmetric space X in
its tube realization is the set of matrices x ∈ M(m, R) with a positive
definite symmetric part:
                               x + xT ≫ 0.
   Its bounded realization is given by:
                   D = {x ∈ M(m, R) | kxkop < 1}.

 Example 2. Let V be the space R×Rn−1 . One writes x = (x0 , x1 ), x0 ∈
R, x1 ∈ Rn−1 . Then the Jordan product is defined as follows : z = x◦y
if z0 = x0 y0 − (x1 |y1), z1 = x0 y1 + y0 x1 , where (x1 |y1) is the usual inner
product on Rn−1 . The Jordan determinant is then given by ∆(x) =
x20 + kx1 k2 . (This Jordan algebra is actually a Jordan field.)
   The corresponding structure group is the group Str(V ) = R+ ×O(n),
and the conformal group Conf(V ) is equal to O(1, n+1). The conformal
compactification of V is the n-sphere S n .
   Consider the Euclidian involution α : (x0 , x1 ) 7→ (x0 , −x1 ). The
corresponding groups G and K are isomorphic respectively to SO0 (1, n)
and SO(n).
   The Riemannian symmetric space X is the real hyperbolic space of
dimension n, realized as a half-space
                     X = {(x0 , x1 ) ∈ R × Rn−1 | x0 > 0}.
The bounded realization of this symmetric space is isomorphic to the
Euclidean ball:
                     D = {x ∈ Rn | kxk < 1}.



1.3. Iwasawa decomposition and spherical Fourier Transform.
According to (1.3) the Cartan involution of the group G is given by
                        θ(g) = (−j) ◦ g ◦ (−j),         g ∈ G.
The Lie algebra g, which is an algebra of quadratic vector fields on V ,
decomposes under dθ into a direct sum of two eigenspaces:
                                      g = k + p,
where the Lie algebra k is the Lie algebra of the group K introduced
above. Let us fix a Jordan frame {c1 , ..., cr0 } in V0 . Then the space a
of the linear vector fields
                            r0
                            X
                     ξ(x) =    tj L(cj )x (tj ∈ R),
                                  j=1

is a Cartan subspace in p. The root system of the pair (g, a) is of type
A, C, or D. We choose the Weyl chamber a+ defined by t1 < · · · < tr0
in case of type A, or 0 < t1 < · · · < tr0 in ncase of typeoC or D.
                                                    tj −ti
   For type A the positive roots are :                     , i < j , for type D :

  We define A = exp a, and, as usual the nilpotent subgroup N. It can
be written N = N0 ⋉ N1 , where N0 is a triangular subgroup in Str(V0 ),
and N1 is the group of translations
                        x 7→ x + v     with v ∈ V1 .
  The Iwasawa decomposition can be described as follows: every x ∈ X
can be uniquely written
                        x = na · e = n0 a · e + v,
with a ∈ A, n0 ∈ N0 , v ∈ V1 . One writes
                       a = exp A(x) with A(x) ∈ a.
                                 P
If λ ∈ a∗C , we write, for ξ(x) = j tj L(cj )x,
                                       r0
                                       X
                            hλ, ξi =         λj tj .
                                       j=1

Then
                           ehλ,A(x)i = ∆λ (x0 ),
where ∆λ is the power function of the symmetric cone Ω0 in the Eu-
clidean Jordan algebra V0 , and x0 denotes the V0 -component of x:
                    x = x0 + x1 ,    x0 ∈ V0 , x1 ∈ V1 .

  The spherical functions ϕλ for X = G/K are given by
                             Z
                                             
(1.5)               ϕλ (x) =    ∆ρ−λ (k · x)0 dk,
                                K
where dk is the normalized Haar measure of K, and ρ is the half-sum
of the positive roots:
             1                  1                    1
    hρ, ξi = Tr(ad ξ)|Lie(N ) = Tr(ad ξ)|Lie(N0) + Tr(ad ξ)|Lie(N1 ) .
             2                  2                    2
One obtains ρj = d40 (2j − r0 − 1) + 2r
                                     n1
                                        0
                                          , where the integer d0 is defined
               d0
by n0 = r0 + 2 r0 (r0 − 1).
  The spherical Fourier transform of a K-invariant integrable function
f on X is defined on ia∗ by
                Z                      Z
      F f (λ) =    ϕ−λ (x)f (x)µ(dx) =    ∆ρ+λ (x0 )f (x)µ(dx),

where µ(dx) = ∆(x0 ) dx is a G-invariant measure on X . Here and
                        r

elsewhere further the measure dx denotes the Euclidean measure asso-
ciated to the Euclidean structure defined on V by (x | y) = tr(xα(y)).

1.4. Berezin kernels and the Kantor cross-ratio. The Kantor
cross ratio of four points of a simple Jordan algebra V is the ratio-
nal function
                                     ∆(x1 − x3 ) ∆(x1 − x4 )
(1.6)         {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 } =            :            .
                                     ∆(x2 − x3 ) ∆(x2 − x4 )
It is invariant under conformal transformations and extends to the
conformal compactificaion M of V .
   The invariance by translations is obvious. The invariance under
Str(V ) comes from the fact that ∆ is semi-invariant under Str(V ). The
invariance under the inverse j : x 7→ −x−1 follows from the formula
([13], Lemma X.4.4):
                                       ∆(y − x)
                    ∆ j(x) − j(y) =               .
                                        ∆(x)∆(y)
  Furthermore it is proved that a local transformation which preserves
the cross ratio is the restriction of an element of Conf(V) ( cf. [16],
Theorem 6). Being given the Kantor cross-ratio (1.6) we shall introduce
the kernel F on X by
(1.7)            F (x, y) = {x, y, −α(x), −α(y)}
                                                 
                            ∆ x + α(x) ∆ y + α(y)
                          =                      .
                            ∆ x + α(y) ∆ y + α(x)
This function is invariant under G and positive. The Berezin kernel
Bν can be defined for every ν ∈ C as
                                 
                            r0

In virtue of the G-invariance of the kernel Bν the Berezin function

W is simple), then

  Therefore, for types I and II:

For type III:
                                Q(ν) = cΓΩ (ν).
For type IV:
                           ΓΩ (ν) = (ΓΩ0 (ν))2 ,
notice that in this case the Jordan algebra W is not simple anymore :
W ≃ V0 × V0 .
  The above theorem was proved by different methods in [9, 29, 25].

second one.
  -For every g ∈ Str(V C ) one has h(gz, w) = h(z, g ∗ w).
  -For every x ∈ W one has h(x, x) = ∆(e − x2 ).
  Recall that the Bergman kernel of the Hermitian symmetric space,

whose X is a real form, is given by h(z, w)− r .

  Example 1. For V = M(m, R) the canonical polynomial is given by
h(x, x) = det(I − xxT ).
  Example 2. For V = R × Rn−1 the canonical polynomial is given by
h(x, x) = (1 − kxk2 )2 .

Furthermore F̃ (u, 0) = limv→0 F̃ (u, v) = ∆(α(u−1 ) − u)∆(α(u)), and
one can show that F̃ (u, 0) = h(u, u).

where b(ν) is the polynomial of degree 2r0 given by:

   This identity has been established for V complex by Engliš [10], also
in a slightly different form by Unterberger and Upmeier [25], and has
been generalized in [11].
   In general we do not know any explicit expression for the differential
operator D(ν). However an explicit formula has been obtained in the
special case of a simple complex Jordan algebra, and for ν = δ [17]:

                                    ∂z      ∂ z̄
where z = x + iy.
  Observe that, for V = C we get:
                                           ∂2
                            D (δ) = y 2

is nothing but the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the upper hyperbolic
half-plane.

This shows that this function is well defined on Y for κ ∈ C, and
bounded for ℜκ ≥ 0.
  Denote by µo the normalized invariant measure on Y and define

                  j=1 Γ(κ + 2 + δ − ρj )Γ(κ + 2 + δ + ρj )

Proof. Assume first that κ ∈ N. The Bernstein identity (1.3) implies
that
                       D−κ ψ−κ = b(−κ)ψ−κ+1 ,
     By integrating this identity on Y we obtain
                                     Z
                b(−κ)J(κ + 1) =         D−κ ψ−κ µo (dy)

                                           Y

since the operator D−κ is self adjoint. The constant term of the differ-
ential operator D−κ is given by
                               D−κ 1 = γ−κ (ρ).
     We finally get
(1.11)                  γ−κ (ρ)J(κ) = b(−κ)J(κ − 1).
     On the other hand the sequence
                              Q2ro
                                        j=1 Γ(κ + 1 + βj )

                              Q2ro
                                j=1 (κ + βj )

Therefore J(κ) = cφ(κ) and because of the “initial” condition J(0) = 1,
we finally get
                                   φ(κ)
                           J(κ) =       .
                                   φ(0)
The functions φ(κ) and J(κ) are holomorphic for ℜκ > 0 and grow
polynomially :
                         |φ(κ)| ≤ c1 (1 + |κ|)N1
                         |J(κ)| ≤ J(0) = 1.
Indeed, 0 ≤ ψ−κ (y) ≤ 1. Therefore, the Carlson’s theorem implies that
                                     φ(κ)
                            J(κ) =        ,
                                     φ(0)
for every κ ∈ C such that ℜκ > 0.                                 
  By writing y ′ = c(iv), J(κ) becomes an integral over iV . One shows
that                                                 r0
                 ψ̃−κ (iv) := ψ−κ (c(iv)) = h(v, −v)− r κ .
Therefore,                     Z

                                   V
In fact, in this realization an invariant measure µo on Y is given by
           n
h(v, −v)− r dv.
  The above integral has been considered and computed by Hua in
[15], Chapter II in several special cases.

            2. Berezin kernels and representations
   Following ideas developed in [6, 7, 14] we shall now give an alterna-
tive approach to the theory of Berezin kernels considering intertwining
operators for the maximal degenerate series representations of a con-
formal group.
2.1. Maximal degenerate series representations. The character
χ of the structure group Str(V ) (cf. (1.1)) can be trivially extended
to the whole parabolic subgroup P by χ(hn̄) := χ(h) for every h ∈
Str(V ), n̄ ∈ N.
  For every s ∈ C we define a character χs of P by
                                                   n
                            χs (p̄) := |χ( p̄)|s+ 2r .
                                                 Conf(V)
    The induced representation πes = IndP              (χs ) of the conformal
group acts on the space
  Ies := {f ∈ C ∞ (Conf(V )) | f (hp̄) = χs (p̄)f (h), ∀h ∈ Str(V ), p̄ ∈ P },
18                JACQUES FARAUT, MICHAEL PEVZNER

by left translations. A pre-Hilbert structure on Ies is given by
                                 Z
                             2
                         kf k =      |f (u)|2 du,
                                     U

where U is the maximal compact subgroup of Conf(V ) associated with
the Cartan involution θ, and du is the normalized Haar measure of U.
   According to the Gelfand-Naimark decomposition a function f ∈ Ies
is determined by its restriction fV (x) = f (nx ) on N ≃ V . Let Is be
the subspace of C ∞ (V ) of functions fV with f ∈ Ies . The conformal
group acts on Is by:
                                     n
(2.1)     πs (g)f (x) = |A(g, x)|s+ 2r f (g −1.x), g ∈ Conf(V ), x ∈ V,
where
                                              
                        A(g, x) := χs (Dg −1)x .
This action is usually called the even maximal degenerated series rep-
resentation of Conf(V ).
  One shows that the norm of a function f (nx ) = fV (x) ∈ Is is given
by:
                           Z
                       2
(2.2)             kf k =       |fV (x)|2 h(x, −x)2ℜs dx,
                             V

   The formula (2.2) implies that for ℜs = 0 the space Is is contained
in L2 (V ) and the representation πs extends as a unitary representation
on L2 (V ).

  In order to address the question of irreducibility and unitarity of
these representations we refer the reader to [21], [22, 24] and to [27].

  Following the standard procedure we introduce an intertwining op-
erator between πs and π−s .
  Consider the map Aes defined on Ies by
                             Z
(2.3)             e
          f −→ (As f )(g) :=   f (gjn)dn, ∀g ∈ Conf(V ),
                                 N

where dn is a left invariant Haar measure on N. We will see that this
integral converges for ℜs > 2rn0 .

Proposition 2.1. For every f ∈ Ies the function A  es f belongs to Ie−s and
the map Aes given by (2.3) intertwines the corresponding representations
of the conformal group:
(2.4)     π       es f ) = A
          e−s (g)(A        es (e
                               πs (g)f ), ∀f ∈ Ies , g ∈ Conf(V ).
      BEREZIN KERNELS AND ANALYSIS ON MAKAREVICH SPACES                       19

  Proof. The map A      es obviously commutes with the left action of
Conf(V ). We have to check that A      es f transforms in an appropriate
way under the right action of P . Notice first that A       es f is N right
invariant. Indeed
                            Z                  Z
            es f )(gn̄) =
           (A                  f (gn̄jn)dn =       f (gjn′jjn)dn

                         =     f (gjn′′)dn′′ = (Aes f )(g).
                                    V

For what concerns the action of Str(V ) we have for every f ∈ Ies :
                        Z               Z
(2.5)      e
          (As f )(gℓ) =   f (gℓjn)dn =     f (gj(ℓt)−1 n)dn,

where h denotes the transformation adjoint to h ∈ Str(V ) with respect
to the bilinear form Tr L(xy) on V .
  Indeed, one shows, (see [13]Prop.VIII.2.5) that jℓj = (ℓt )−1 , ∀ℓ ∈
Str(V ). Thus the equality (2.5) implies that

  Define the map As : Is → I−s by

is well defined on Is × Is and is Conf(V )-invariant.
Proof. The invariance follows from the intertwining property of As . It
can also be shown by a straightforward verification. Indeed, let us recall
following property of conformal transformations (cf. [12], Lemma 6.6)
:
(2.7)
  ∆(g.x − g.y)2 = A(g, x)A(g, y)∆(x − y)2 , g ∈ Conf(V ), x, y ∈ V.
Therefore,
       B (π (g)f1 , πs (g)f2 ) =
       Z Zs s

Denote x = g.x′ , y = g.y ′. Thus dx = A(g, x′) r dx′ and dy = A(g, y ′) r dy ′ .
Notice that g ·g −1 = Id and therefore (Dg −1)g.x ◦(Dg)x = Id. It implies
that A(g −1 , g.x)A(g, x) = 1.

       BEREZIN KERNELS AND ANALYSIS ON MAKAREVICH SPACES                   21

   According to the general theory (see for instance [18]) these maximal
degenerate series representations πs are spherical. We shall determine
the corresponding U-fixed vector of the representation πs .
   Using the Iwasawa decomposition of Conf(V ) we write g = uℓ(g)n̄,
where ℓ(g) ∈ Str(V ), which is defined up to a multiplication by an
element of U ∩ Str(V ) on the left. Notice by the way that with the
above notation we have θ(g −1)g = n−1 ℓ(g)2 n̄.
   Consider nx ∈ N admitting the decomposition nx = uℓ(nx )n̄. There-
fore
          ℓ(nx )2 = D(θ(n−x )nx )(0) = P (x−1 + α(x))−1 P (x)−1 .
Let f o ∈ Ies be a U-invariant function, with f o (e) = 1. Then
            f o (g) = f o(uℓ(g)n̄) = χs (ℓ(g))f o(u) = χs (ℓ(g)).
Eventually we get that the U-fixed vector fVo in Is is given by
                                             n                      n
        fVo (x) = |∆(x−1 + α(x))∆(x)|−(s+ 2r ) = h(x, −x)−(s+ 2r ) .

  In order to conclude this section we shall discuss conditions under
which the intertwining operator As is well defined.
  Let us evaluate As f o at the identity of the conformal group.
               Z               Z               Z

    As f (e) =     o

                 N                N               V
Notice that the value C(s) of this integral equals
                                             
                                   r       n
                      C(s) = J        (s − ) ,
                                   r0     2r
where J(ν) is given by (1.10). For u ∈ U, f o (u) 6= 0. therefore, for
f ∈ Ies ,
                            |f (g)| ≤ M|f o (g)|,
with
                                         |f (u)|
                             M = sup 0           .
                                    u∈U |f (u)|
Now it is clear that the integral defining As is well defined for ℜs > 2rn0 .
One shows that the map s → As can be actually extended to whole
complex plane as a meromorphic function. Because of the intertwining
property we eventually get:
                       As ◦ A−s = C(s)C(−s)IdIs .
  As it has been noticed by several authors [5, 19, 27] for some partic-
ular values of the parameter s the intertwining operator As turns out
to be a differential operator, which, furthermore, satisfies a generalized
Capelli identity. Indeed, the map As may be seen as a convolution

operator with the kernel |∆(x − y)|2s− r which has a meromorphic con-
tinuation with respect to s. One shows that, for 2s − nr = −2ℓ, ℓ ∈ N,

                                                  ∂ 2ℓ
this is a differential operator proportional to ∆ ∂x   .


2.2. Restriction of πs and Canonical representations. We shall
study the representations πs when restricted to the subgroup G. The
representation space Ies can be seen as a line bundle over the conformal
compactification M.
   The Makarevich space X is one of the open orbits of G acting on
M. The space Is (X ) of functions in I(s) = Is (V ) supported in the
closure X ⊂ V is then invariant. We shall consider the corresponding
representation Ts of G on Is (X ).
   The problem is to determine for which values of the parameter s the
representation Ts of the group G is unitarizable, and then to decompose
it into irreducible ones. According to an established terminology taking
its roots in [26] one calls such representations canonical representations
of the group G.
   A key observation is the connection between the canonical represen-
tation Ts and the Berezin kernel. We shall make this link clear.
     Consider the bilinear form on Is (X ) × Is (X ) given by
(2.8)                 e α (f1 , f2 ) := Bs (f1 , f2 ◦ (−α)),
                      B s

where Bs (f1 , f2 ) is the bilinear form on Is (V ) × Is (V ) introduced in
Proposition (2.3).
                                   e α is invariant under the action
Proposition 2.4. The bilinear form B s
of the group G.
  The proof uses the invariance property of the cross-ratio, and the
two following lemmæ.
Lemma 2.5. For every g ∈ G the following identity holds:
                           A(g, −α(x)) = A(g, x).
Proof. By definition the transformation g commutes with −α for every
g ∈ G: g ◦ (−α) = (−α) ◦ g. Differentiating this equality we have
                     (Dg)−α(x) ◦ (−α) = (−α) ◦ (Dg)x ,
or equivalently (Dg)−α(x) = (−α) ◦ (Dg)x ◦ (−α). Notice that for every
h ∈ Str(V ) one has
                   (−α) ◦ h ◦ (−α) = α ◦ h ◦ α ∈ Str(V ),
      BEREZIN KERNELS AND ANALYSIS ON MAKAREVICH SPACES                23

and on the other hand χ(α ◦ h ◦ α) = χ(h). Since ∆(α(x)) = ∆(x) we
finally get
                     ∆(α ◦ h ◦ α(x)) = χ(h)∆(x),
which implies the statement for h = (Dg)x .            
Lemma 2.6. Let x be an element in V , then for every g ∈ G the
following identity holds
                       ∆((gx)0 ) = A(g, x)∆(x0 ).
(Recall that the subscript   0   means the V0 -component.)
  Notice that ∆((gx)0 ) = ∆(g.x − g.(−α(x)) = ∆(g.x + α(g.x)) for
every g ∈ G. Let us substitute y by −α(x) in (2.7), then
       ∆(g.x − g.(−α(x)))2 = A(g, x)A(g, −α(x))∆(x + α(x))2 .
Therefore, according to the lemma (2.5), we have
                      ∆((gx)0 ) = ±A(g, x)∆(x0 ).
Since for g = Id the sign in the above equation is positive, and the
group G being connected it remains positive for every g ∈ G.    

  Let us introduce the multiplication operator on the space Is (X ) by
                                              n
                       Ms f (x) = ∆(x0 )s+ 2r f (x).
These operators intertwine the canonical representation Ts and the left
regular action L of the group G,
                Ms ◦ Ts (g) = L(g) ◦ Ms ,         g ∈ G,
           
where L(g)f (x) = f (g −1 · x).
Proposition 2.7. Let us define the bilinear form Bαs on Cc (X )×Cc (X )
by
                                                   e α (f1 , f2 ).
           Bαs (F1 , F1 ) = Bαs (Ms f1 , Ms f2 ) = B s
Then
                          ZZ

(2.9)    Bs (F1 , F2 ) =     Bν (x, y)F1 (x)F2 (y)µ(dx)µ(dy),

                  the Berezin kernel introduced in (1.8) and
       r       n
ν = − r0 s − 2r .
  Therefore the decomposition of the canonical representations reduces
now to a classical problem in spherical harmonic analysis.
  Let Λ be the set of parameters λ ∈ a∗C for which the spherical function
ϕλ given by (1.5) is positive definite. Let ψ be a continuous function of
24                     JACQUES FARAUT, MICHAEL PEVZNER

positive type on G which is K-biinvariant. By the Bochner-Godement
theorem there is a unique bounded positive measure m on Λ such that
                              Z
                       ψ(x) =     ϕλ (x)m(dλ).
                                          Λ
If ψ is integrable, then the measure m is absolutely continuous with
respect to the Plancherel measure, with a density given by the Fourier
transform of ψ:
                                          dλ
                        m(dλ) = F ψ(λ)         ,
                                        |c(λ)|
where c(λ) is the Harish-Chandra c-function of the symmetric space
X.

  Therefore the problem is :
  (1) Determine the set W ⊂ R of values ν for which the Berezin kernel
Bαν (or the corresponding K-biinvariant function ψν ) is of positive type.
  (2) For ν ∈ W, determine the positive measure mν on Λ such that
                                Z
                       ψν (x) =   ϕλ (x)mν (dλ).
                                          Λ
  These problems have been solved for hyperbolic spaces by van Dijk,
Hille, Pasquale [6, 8]. Notice however that only real hyperbolic spaces
are Makarevich spaces as introduced above.
  The case G = U(p, q) was studied by Hille, and Neretin [14, 20], and
the case when G = SO(p, q) by Neretin in [20].

     For ν >   r0
                    − 1 the function ψν is integrable and, for λ ∈ ia∗ :

                                        Q(ν)
  It follows that ψν is of positive type, and
                            Z

  According to Helgason we define the Fourier transform of an inte-
grable function f on X . The Iwasawa decomposition of the group G
can be written as G = NAK. If k −1 g ∈ N exp(H)K with H ∈ a, one
writes
             H = A(x, b), x ∈ gK, b ∈ kM ∈ B = K/M,
where M is the centralizer of A in K.
  The Fourier transform of f is the function defined on ia∗ × B by
                               Z
                    ˆ

  We consider fˆ(λ) := fˆ(λ, ·) as an element of the space Hλ ≃ L2 (B)
which carries a unitary spherical principal series Πλ of G. Then the
map f 7→ fˆ(λ) intertwines the left regular representation L and Πλ .
Theorem 2.8. For ν > rn0 − 1, the Berezin form is positive definite.
Therefore the representation Ts is unitarizable, decomposes multiplicity
free as a direct integral of spherical principal series Πλ of G, which
corresponds to the following Plancherel formula :

2.3. Berezin kernel on the Riemannian Compact Dual. In order
to study the ”deformation” of the regular representation of the compact
group U we shall investigate the spherical Fourier transform of the
Berezin kernels on the compact dual symmetric space Y.
   The spherical functions of the symmetric space Y = U/K are given
by
                         Z
(2.10)          Φm (x) =     ∆m ((k.x)0 )dk = ϕm−ρ (x),
                                 K
where the weights m = (m1 , . . . , mn ) ∈ Zn are given according to
different cases by following conditions :
      • If V is a Euclidean Jordan algebra (root system of type A), then
        m1 ≥ m2 ≥ · · · ≥ mn .
      • If V is a non Euclidean algebra of split type (root system of
        type D), them −|m|1 ≥ m2 ≥ · · · ≥ mn .
      • If V is either a complex or a non Euclidean Jordan algebra of
        non split type (root system of type C), then 0 ≥ m1 ≥ m2 ≥
        · · · ≥ mn .
  The spherical Fourier coefficients of a K-invariant integrable function
f on Y are given by
                              Z
                    a(m) =       f (y)Φm (y)µ0(dy).
                                         Y
For ℜκ ≥ 0, the Berezin function ψ−κ is bounded on Y. We will
determine its spherical Fourier coefficients
                           Z
                  aκ (m) =     ψ−κ (y)Φm (y)dµ0(dy).
                                     Y

Notice that aκ (0) = J(κ).

Theorem 2.9. The Fourier coefficients of the Berezin kernel function
ψ−κ are given by
                     Qn          1                 1
                       j=1 Γ(κ + 2 + δ − ρj )Γ(κ + 2 + δ + ρj )
 aκ (m) = J(κ) Qn           1                      1                .
                 j=1 Γ(κ + 2 + δ − ρj + mj )Γ(κ + 2 + δ + ρj − mj )

     Proof We use the same method as in [28].
     (a) We show first that the measure on Y given by
                                  1
                                      ψ−κ (y)µ0(dy)
                                 J(κ)
converges to the Dirac measure δ at the base point e of Y in the sense
of tight convergence of measures. The proof of this fact is based on the
following lemma.
Lemma 2.10. Let K be a compact topological space, and µ a posi-
tive measure on it such that every non empty open set has a positive
measure. Let q ≥ 0 be a continuous function on K which attains its
maximum at only one point x0 . Define, for n ∈ N,
                              Z
                         an =    q(x)n µ(dx),
                                       K

and, for a continuous function ϕ on K,
                               Z
                             1
                   Ln (ϕ) =       ϕ(x)q(x)n µ(dx).
                             an K
Then
                                 lim Ln (ϕ) = ϕ(x0 ).
                             n→∞

     Proof For 0 < α < M = max q, there exits a constant Cα such that
                                    an ≥ Cα αn .
In fact there is a neighborhood V of x0 such that q(x) ≥ α for x ∈ V,
and
                             an ≥ µ(V)αn .
Let W be a neighborhood of x0 . For x ∈ K \ W, q(x) ≥ β < M.
Choose α such that β < α < M. then

   The function ψ−κ attains its maximum M = 1 only at y = e. There-
fore Lemma (2.10) applies. It follows thet, for every m,
                                1
                         lim       aκ (m) = 1.
                        κ→∞ J(κ)


  (b) Assume that κ ∈ N. From the Bernstein identity (1.3) it fol-
lows that the spherical Fourier coefficients aκ (m) satisfy the following
recursion relation :
                  γ−κ (ρ − m)aκ (m) = b(−κ)aκ−1 (m).
Since, for m = 0, γ−κ (ρ)aκ (0) = b(−κ)aκ−1 (0) we obtain
                   γ−κ (ρ − m) aκ (m)    aκ−1 (m)
                                       =          .
                      γ−κ (ρ)   aκ (0)   aκ−1 (0)
Furthermore, since aκ (0) = J(κ), by (a)
                                aκ (m)
                             lim       = 1.
                            κ→∞ aκ (0)

The sequence given by
                 Qn            1
                     j=1 Γ(κ + 2 + δ − ρj )Γ(κ   + 21 + δ + ρj )
     φ(κ) =   Qn          1                                             ,
               j=1 Γ(κ + 2 + δ − ρj + mj )Γ(κ    + 12 + δ + ρj − mj )
satisfies the same recursion relation as aaκκ(m)
                                              (0)
                                                  does. Moreover, from the
asymptotic equivalence
                                                         
  Γ(z + a)      a−b      1                             −2
            ∼z       1 + (b − a)(b + a − 1) + O(z ) , as z → ∞,
  Γ(z + b)              2z
it follows that
                              lim φ(κ) = 1.
                             κ→∞
Therefore we have proved the theorem for κ ∈ N.
(c) By using Carlson’s theorem, as we did in the proof of Theorem
(1.4), we conclude that the statement is still valid for ℜκ ≥ 0. 

2.4. Restriction of the representation πs to the compact group
U. The compact symmetric space Y = U/K is also of Makarevich type.
Indeed,
             U = {g ∈ Conf(V ) | α ◦ j ◦ g ◦ j ◦ α = g}o.
From the generalized cross-ratio (1.6) we define the kernel F c (u, v) by
              F c (u, v) = {u, v, −α(u−1), −α(v −1 )}
                                                       
                           ∆ u + α(u−1 ) ∆ v + α(v −1 )

                           ∆ u + α(v −1 ) ∆ v + α(u−1 )
28                     JACQUES FARAUT, MICHAEL PEVZNER

and F c (u, 0) = h(u, −u).
  Similarly to what we did in Section 2.2 we twist the bilinear form
Bs by the involution j ◦ α, in other words we replace y by α(y −1), and
by introducing multiplication operators
                                                       n
                               Msc f (x) = h(x, −x)s+ 2r f (x)
we eventually obtain a U-invariant bilinear form on C ∞ (Y):
                        ZZ
          c
        Bs (F1 , F2 ) =     Bsc (x, y)F1 (x)F2 (y)µ0(dx)µ0 (dy),
                                   Y×Y
                                    r0
where   Bsc (x, y)   = F (x, y) r ν .

   The spherical dual ÛK is parameterized by the set of weights m =
(m1 , . . . , mn ) described in the previous section. To such a weight m
corresponds a (class of) unitary spherical representation Πm on a finite
dimensional vector space Hm of dimension dm . The highest weight µ
of Πm is given by
                                         Xr0
                              hµ, ξi = −     mj tj ,
                                                 j=1
          P
if ξ(x) =    tj L(cj )x. In the space Hm there is a normalized K-fixed
vector vm . The Fourier coefficient fˆ(m) of an integrable function f on
Y is the vector in Hm defined by
                               Z
                       ˆ
                      f (m) =       Πm (g)vm f (g)dg.
                                         U/K

The map f 7→ fˆ(m) intertwines the left regular representation of U
and Πm .
Theorem 2.11. For a κ ∈ N the Berezin form Bcs is positive definite.
Therefore the restriction of πs to the compact group U decomposes into
a direct sum of spherical principal series representations Πm of U ac-
cording to the following Plancherel formula
                               X
                  Bc (f, f¯) =
                           s        dm aκ (m)kfˆ(m)k2 ,
                                         m∈ÛK
             r           n
where κ =    r0
                (s   −   2r
                            ),   f ∈ C(U/K).
   By the first part of the proof of Theorem 2.8, in some sense, the
canonical representations of the compact dual of G tend to the left
regular representation when the parameter κ goes through the negative
integer points. In fact, for f ∈ Cc (Y),
             Z                                        Z
         1           c
   lim             Bκ (x, y)f (x)f (y)µ0(dx)µ0 (dy) =    |f (y)|2µ0 (dy).

Similarly, in the non compact case, as ν → ∞, the probability measure
I(ν)−1 ψν (x)µ(dx) converges to the Dirac measure δe at the identity
element e. It follows that, for f ∈ Cc (X ),
               Z                                    Z
           1          α
    lim             Bν (x, y)f (x)f (y)µ(dx)µ(dy) =     |f (x)|2µ(dx).
   ν→∞ I(ν) X ×X                                      X

In some sense, as ν → ∞, the canonical representation Tν tends to the
regular representation of G on L2 (X ).
   In conclusion we should mention that originally the one parameter
family of Berezin kernels was introduced in the context of quantization
of Kählerian symmetric spaces in [2]. The last remark says that the
Berezin symbolic calculus ”deforms” the usual point-wise multiplica-
tion of functions. We refer the reader to [1, 25] for more details on
asymptotics of the Berezin transform.
