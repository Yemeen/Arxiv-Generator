                                                       In this paper we study the possibility to define irreducible representations of
                                                   the symmetric groups with the help of finitely many relations. The existence of
                                                   finite bases is established for the classes of representations corresponding to two-part
                                                   partitions and to partitions from the fundamental alcove.

                                                                                     1. Introduction
                                                   In this paper we continue the research begun in [8]. Let us recall the basic notation
                                            used there. Let Xn = {xst : t ∈ N, s = 1, . . . , n} be a set of commuting variables, K
                                            be a field and Fn = K[Xn ] be the free commutative algebra with 1. Denote by Fnr the
                                            subspace of Fn spanned by monomials of the form xji11 · · · xjirr , where {i1 , . . . , ir } = {1,
                                            . . . , r}. The symmetric group G(r) of degree r acts on Fnr on the left by the formula
                                            πxji11 · · · xjirr = xjπi1 1 · · · xjπir r .
                                                                                         P               σ(1)      σ(k)
                                                   Put [xt1 , . . . , xtk ] =              σ∈G(k) sgn(σ)xt1 · · · xtk , where k = 1, . . . , n. Let λ be a
                                                                                                                         λ                     r
                                            partition of r into no more                 Qλ1than n parts. Denote by S the subspace of Fn spanned by
                                            polynomials of the form i=1 [xti,1 , . . . , xti,µi ], where µ is the partition conjugate to λ and
                                            {ti,j : 1 ≤ i ≤ λ1 , 1 ≤ j ≤ µi } = {1, . . . , r}. For any positive integer i, denote by λ + (in )
                                            the partition (λ1 + i, . . . , λn + i) (see Section 3).
                                                   Let U be a KG(r)-submodule of Fnr . Denote by U↑, or more precisely by U↑n if we want
                                            to underline the role of n, the KG(r + n)-submodule of Fnr+n generated by the subspace
                                                                                                                           n
                                            U[xr+1 , . . . , xr+n ]. Note that U ⊂ S λ implies U↑ ⊂ S λ+(1 ) .
                                                   Conversely, let V be a KG(r+n)-submodule of Fnr+n . Denote by V ↓ (or by V ↓n ) the set
                                            of all polynomials f ∈ Fnr such that f [xr+1 , . . . , xr+n ] ∈ V . Clearly, V ↓ is a KG(r)-module.
                                                                                                                             n
                                            Applying [1, Corollary 17.18] one can show that V ⊂ S λ+(1 ) implies V ↓ ⊂ S λ .
                                                   Let U↑t or U↓t denote the result of the t-fold application of ↑ or ↓ respectively to
                                            U, of course, if this is possible (for U↓t ). Let us remark the following simple properties:
                                            U↓↑ ⊂ U ⊂ U↑↓ and U↓↑↓ = U↓ for any submodule U of Fnr , where r ≥ n.
                                                   In [8] we formulated the following problem:
                                                                              n
                                            Problem 2. Let Vi ⊂ S λ+(qi ) , i ∈ N, where 0 ≤ q1 < q2 <· · · , be a sequence of submodules
                                            such that Vi ↑qi+1 −qi ⊂ Vi+1 for every i ∈ N. Does there exist any N such that, for every
                                            i > N, we have VN ↑qi −qN = Vi ?
                                               We considered this problem as some special, though important, case of the following
                                            problem:
                                            Problem 1. Suppose char K = p > 0. Is every sequence of multilinear polynomials from
                                            A finitely based?
                                               Here A is the free commutative K-algebra with free generators fi (xt1 , . . . , xtn(i) ), where
                                            i = 1, . . . , k and t1 , . . . , tn(i) ∈ N, a polynomial of A is considered to be multilin-
                                            ear if it is multilinear with respect to the multiplicities of the variables xj (for example,

                                                                                                  1
f (x1 , x2 )f (x2 , x3 ) is not a multilinear polynomial) and implication is considered with re-
spect to K-linear actions, multiplication by elements of A and renaming the variables
xj .
     Problem 1 can be regarded as the analog of Specht’s problem for forms. In that case
form relations play the role of identities. An example of these relations is the well known
Garnir relations. In the case char K = 0 the latter define the Specht modules and thus the
irreducible modules. If char K = p > 0 then this is not the case and a problem about the
existence of finite sets of relations that define some classes of irreducible modules arises.
                                                                                n
By the results of [8] it is natural to consider the classes of the form D λ+(i ) , i ∈ N ∪ {0},
where λ + (1n ) is a p-regular partition. This choice corresponds to solving Problem 2 in
                                                                            n
the case where qi = i − 1 and Vi is the maximal submodule of S λ+(i−1 ) for any i ∈ N.
     The positive solution to the last problem for partitions λ that satisfy Condition 1
formulated in Section 3 at page 5 is given by Theorem 1. According to the results of [9]
and [10] there are some partitions λ not satisfying Condition 1. However, we know that it is
satisfied for partitions λ containing no more than n nonzero parts such that λ1 −λn ≤ p−n
and for two-part partitions. This is proved in Section 4 with the help of the results of the
papers [6] and [4]. Note that we consider the case n = 2 only for illustration, since [8,
Theorem 6] solves the partial case n = 2 of Problem 1 without any restriction on the
submodules Vi .


                                    2. Preliminaries
      Let us fix an algebraically closed field K of positive characteristic p and an integer
n ≥ 2. Let E be the linear K-space with basis v1 ,. . . ,vn and GLn (K) be the group of all
K-linear automorphisms of E. The group GLn (K) is naturally endowed with the structure
of an algebraic K-group and we may consider polynomial (rational) GLn (K)-modules with
respect to this structure. Denote by Λ the set of all sequences of whole numbers of length n.
We write λ D µ, where λ, µ ∈ Λ, if we have λ1 +· · · +λi ≥ µ1 +· · · +µi for any i = 1,. . . ,n.
For a polynomial GLn (K)-module V and a sequence of whole numbers λ = (λ1 ,. . . ,λn ),
we denote by V λ the set of all v ∈ V such that diag(t1 ,. . . ,tn )v = tλ1 1 · · · tλnn v for any
t1 ,. . . ,tn ∈ K ∗ . Clearly, V λ is a K-linear space. This space is called the λ-weight space of
V . If V λ 6= 0 then we call λ a weight of V . Denote by Λ+ the subset of Λ consisting of
sequences (λ1 ,. . . ,λn ) such that λ1 ≥· · · ≥ λn .
      In the papers [3] and [7] the theory of the so-called tilting modules is developed. Here
we assume that any tilting module is a finite dimensional polynomial GLn (K)-module. We
will not give definitions of these objects. Instead, let us enumerate their basic properties
necessary for the sequel.

  1) E is a tilting module (by the definitions of [3] and [7]).

  2) The tensor product of tilting modules is also a tilting module (the first full proof in
     the general case was obtained by O. Mathieu [11]).

  3) For any λ ∈ Λ+ there exists an indecomposable module P (λ) such that dim P (λ)λ = 1
     and if dim P (λ)µ > 0 for some µ ∈ Λ, then µ E λ (see [3, Theorem (1.1)]).

  4) Any tilting module is a direct sum of tilting modules isomorphic to P (λ), λ ∈ Λ+
     (see [3, Theorem (1.1)]).



                                                2
    For any positive integer r, we denote by G(r) the symmetric group of degree r, i.e. the
set of bijections σ of the set of positive integers such that σ(i) = i for any i > r. This
realization of the symmetric groups implies the inclusions G(r) ⊂ G(r ′ ) for r ≤ r ′ . Let
sgn(σ) denote the sign of a permutation σ. Let Λ+            r denote the subset of Λ
                                                                                        +
                                                                                          consisting
of the sequences of nonnegative integers with sum r. For any set S we denote by iS the
identity map from S to itself.                         L r
    Consider an arbitrary decomposition E ⊗r = hi=1            Mi (r) into a direct sum of indecom-
posable GLn (K)-modules. By properties 1) and 2) the module E ⊗r is tilting. Therefore
by property 4) and the Krull-Schmidt theorem the modules Mi (r) are tilting indecompos-
able. Put A(r) = EndGLn (K) E ⊗r . We have the natural projections πir : E ⊗r → Mi (r) and
embeddings εri : Mi (r) → E ⊗r . Define eri = εri πir . The endomorphisms eri are primitive
idempotents and we have eri erj = 0 for i 6= j.
    One can see directly from the definition that any weightFof E ⊗r has nonnegative entries
with sum r. Therefore we have the partition {1,. . . ,hr } = λ∈Λ+r Iλ , where Iλ are possibly
empty sets and Mi (r) ∼   = P (λ) for i ∈ Iλ .
                                                                   r
    For any pair i, j ∈ Iλ , we choose some isomorphism τi,j         from Mj (r) to Mi (r) in such a
            r                  r r        r
way that τi,i = iMi (r) and τi,j τj,k = τi,k for any i, j, k ∈PIλ .
    Let us consider the following idempotents eλ = i∈Iλ eri . In addition, we put eλ = 0
if Iλ is empty. We have theP      representation
                                        P          A(r) = S(r) ⊕ J(r), where S(r) is the set of
endomorphisms of the form λ∈Λ+r i,j∈Iλ αi,j εri τi,j      r r
                                                            πj , where αi,j ∈ K, and J(r) is the set
                                    Phr
of endomorphism of the form i,j=1 εri ϕi,j πjr , where ϕi,j ∈ HomGLn (K) (Mj (r), Mi (r)) are
                     r
such that any ϕi,j τj,i is nilpotent if i, j ∈ Iλ and λ ∈ Λ+   r . This decomposition easily follows
from the Fitting lemma and the fact that K is algebraically closed and all modules under
consideration are finite dimensional. We have
                             hr
                             M                       M                  M
                    A(r) =           eri A(r)erj =          S(r)eλ ⊕            eλ J(r)eµ .
                             i,j=1                   λ∈Λ+
                                                        r              λ,µ∈Λ+
                                                                            r


In addition S(r) is a subalgebra of A(r) and S(r)eλ = eλ S(r) = eλ S(r)eλ for any λ ∈ Λ+      r .
    Given π ∈ G(r), let us consider the element σr (π) of A(r) acting by the formula
σr (π)(vi1 ⊗ · · · ⊗vir ) = viπ−1 (1) ⊗ · · · ⊗viπ−1 (r) . Extending σr to the whole of KG(r) by
linearity, we obtain a homomorphism from KG(r) to A(r). With the help of this homo-
morphism we will consider any A-module as a KG(r)-module.
Lemma 1 (De Concini, Procesi [2]). The map σr is an epimorphism. If r ≤ n then σr
is an
    P isomorphism and if r ≥ n + 1 then Ker σr is generated as a two-sided ideal of KG(r)
by σ∈KG(n+1) sgn(σ)σ.

    Let us call a sequence of integers λ = (λ1 , . . . , λs ) such that λ1 ≥· · · ≥ λs ≥ 0 and
λ1 +· · · +λs = r a partition of r. We call this sequence p-regular if there are no p numbers
λi equal to a positive integer. Otherwise this sequence is called p-singular. Any p-regular
partition λ of r labels in the standard way (see [1]) some irreducible KG(r)-module denoted
by D λ . In addition, any irreducible KG(r)-module is isomorphic to some D λ . Using the
epimorphism σr defined above, one can make any irreducible KG(r)-module N isomorphic
to some D λ for a p-regular λ ∈ Λ+  r into an A(r)-module by the formula am = xm, where
m ∈ N, a ∈ A(r), x ∈ KG(r) and σr (x) = a. This definition is correct, since by Lemma 1
and the direct construction of D λ we have (Ker σr )D λ = 0. By Lemma 1 one can easily
check that any irreducible A(r)-module is isomorphic to D λ for some p-regular λ ∈ Λ+     r .
    We say an irreducible representation D µ corresponds to an idempotent eλ if eλ D µ 6= 0.
It is obvious that eλ m = m for any m ∈ D µ and eν D µ = 0 for ν 6= λ. From the general

                                                       3
theory it follows that for any nonzero primitive idempotent there is one up to isomorphism
irreducible representation corresponding to this idempotent.

Lemma 2. The representation D λ , where λ is a p-regular partition of Λ+
                                                                       r , corresponds to
eλ . If λ is a p-singular partition, then eλ = 0.

Proof. For brevity, we put G = G(r), A = A(r), Mi = Mi (r) and ei = eri . Denote by X
the set consisting of λ ∈ Λ+
                           r such that eλ 6= 0. For λ ∈ X we denote by t(λ) the p-regular
partition of Λr such that eλ D t(λ) 6= 0. Clearly, t is a bijection from X to the subset of Λ+
              +
                                                                                             r
consisting of p-regular partitions.
   For any λ ∈ Λ+  r we put

                    v(λ) = c1 · · · cλ1 v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn ,
                                        |     {z      }           |     {z      }
                                          λ1 times                  λn times

where ci is the sum Pof the elements sgn(σ)σ taken over σ ∈ G such that σ(i) = i for any i not
                      s
belonging to {i+ j=1 λj : 0 ≤ s ≤ n−1, i ≤ λs+1}. It is obvious that Av(λ) = KGv(λ) is
isomorphic as a KG-module to the Specht module S λ defined in [1]. Indeed, let us identify
an element vi1 ⊗· · · ⊗vir of (E ⊗r )λ with the tabloid that has each s, s = 1,. . . ,r in row
is . This correspondence extended linearly to (E ⊗r )λ gives an isomorphism of KG-modules
(E ⊗r )λ and M λ . Tabloids and M λ are understood in the sense of [1, Definitions 3.9 and 4.1]
with the only difference that in our case the symmetric group acts on the left. Clearly, the
restriction of this isomorphism to Av(λ) gives the required correspondence.
     Let λ be an arbitrary partition of X. Denote by P the maximal A-submodule of
Av(t(λ)). The modules Av(t(λ))/P and D t(λ) are isomorphic as KG-modules and there-
fore are isomorphic as A-modules. It follows from this fact and from eλ D t(λ) 6= 0 that
eλ Av(t(λ)) 6= 0 and ei Av(t(λ)) 6= 0 for some i ∈ Iλ . All elements of the nonzero space
ei Av(t(λ)) have weight t(λ). On the other hand ei Av(t(λ)) ⊂ Mi ∼   = P (λ). Hence t(λ) is a
weight of P (λ) and t(λ) E λ by property 3).
     Let us prove the reverse inequality. Without loss of generality we may assume Iλ =
{1,. . . ,l}. Here l ≥ 1 since eλ 6= 0. As is well known, KGLn (K)v(λ) is isomorphic to
the so-called Weyl module with highest weight λ. But this same module is embeddable
in P (λ). Thus there is an embedding of GLn (K)-modules τ : KGLn (K)v(λ) → M1 . Let
v = τ (v(λ)).
     Let U be the subgroup of GLn (K) generated by endomorphisms ϕ such that ϕ(vk ) = vk
for k 6= i and ϕ(vi ) = vi + αvj , where α ∈ K and j < i. Corollary 17.18 of [1] actually
means that an element m ∈ (E ⊗r )λ belongs to Av(λ) if and only if um = m for any u ∈ U.
Using this fact and that τ is an embedding of GLn (K)-modules, we get v ∈ Av(λ).
     If eλ had annihilated each composition factor of Av, we would have got eλ Av =
(eλ )s Av = 0. However v ∈ eλ Av. Hence eλ D µ 6= 0, where D µ is a composition factor
of Av and therefore a composition factor of Av(λ). Since Av(λ) ∼       = S λ , we have µ D λ.
By definition µ = t(λ) and therefore µ E λ by what was proved above. Hence we obtain
t(λ) = λ and Av = Av(λ).                                                                     
     During the proof we additionally obtained
Corollary 1. Let v be a nonzero element of Mi ∼= P (λ) of weight λ. Then the GLn (K)-module
generated by v is isomorphic to the Weyl module with highest weight λ and the G(r)-module
generated by v is isomorphic to the Specht module S λ .
   Lemma 1 is very important for our theory. It gives a description via the primitive
idempotents of A of the same irreducible modules that were described in [1] and that were

                                                  4
studied in [8]. Without this lemma the approach taken here would be ineffective. The
author does not know for sure how to cite this assertion. Therefore its proof is given in
this article.


                                3. Embedding operators
      In the previous section we chose an arbitrary decomposition of E ⊗r into a direct sum
of irreducible tilting modules. However, it is convenient that these decompositions for
different r be consistent. Thus we will build them inductively as follows.              L r
      First we put M1 (1) = E. Suppose that we have a decomposition E ⊗r = hi=1                  Mi (r).
By properties 1) and 2) each module Mi (r) ⊗ E is tilting. Therefore by property 4) it is
decomposable into a direct sum of indecomposable tilting modules. Collecting all these
summands, we obtain a decomposition of E ⊗r+1 .
      Let r < r ′ be two positive integers. Let us define an embedding operator fr′ ,r : A(r) →
A(r ′ ) by the formula fr′ ,r (ϕ) = ϕ ⊗ iE ⊗r′−r . Then we L       have fr′ ,r ◦ σr = σr′ |KG(r) and
                                                              ′
fr′′ ,r′ ◦ fr′ ,r = fr′′ ,r . It is obvious that Mi (r) ⊗ E ⊗r −r = j∈X Mj (r ′ ) implies fr′ ,r (eri ) =
P          r′
   j∈X ej .
      Let us recall the terminology and the definitions used in [8]. A partition λ ∈ Λ+              r is
                                                                                  +
called degenerate (n-degenerate) if λn = 0. For two partitions λ, µ ∈ Λr and two integers
α, β, we denote by αλ + βµ the componentwise linear combination of these partitions. Let
(in ) denote the sequence of length n, whose every entry is i. Denote by dr the sum of the
idempotents eλ over all degenerate λ ∈ Λ+         r .
      Now suppose that λ is a partition of Λ+       r satisfying

Condition 1. There exists a such that for any degenerate µ ∈ Λ+
                                                              r+an and k ≥ a the module
P (µ) ⊗ E ⊗(k−a)n
                  does not have a direct summand isomorphic to P (λ + (k n )).
The absence of the direct summand mentioned above for any degenerate µ is equivalent
to eλ+(kn ) fr+kn,r+an (dr+an ) = 0. We will see in Section 4 that this assumption is not
meaningless.
                                                                                  2
Theorem 1. Suppose that λ + (1n ) is a p-regular partition. Let k ≥ rn + (2r + 1)a + a2 n
and µ be a degenerate p-regular partition of Λ+r+kn . Then any KG(r + kn)-module M of
                        λ+(k n )      µ
length 2 with factors D          and D is decomposable.

Proof. Considering, if necessary, the dual modules instead of the initial ones, we may
suppose without loss of generality that there exists a submodule N ⊂ M such that N ∼     = Dµ
and M/N ∼        λ+(k n)
            =D           .
   Let x and y be elements of KG(r + an) such that σr+an (x) = 1 − dr+an and σr+an (y) =
dr+an . In addition we have σr+kn (x) = fr+kn,r+an(1−dr+an ) and σr+kn (y) = fr+kn,r+an (dr+an ).
   We have the following equalities:

      σr+kn (y)eλ+(kn ) = 0, σr+kn (x)eµ = 0, σr+kn (y)eµ = eµ , σr+kn (x)eλ+(kn ) = eλ+(kn ) . (1)

The first one follows from the assumption about λ we have made. The second one follows
from the fact that for any nondegenerate ν ∈ Λ+   r+an the module P (ν) ⊗ E
                                                                             ⊗(k−a)n
                                                                                        does not
have a direct summand isomorphic to P (µ). The last two equalities follow from the two
equalities already proved and from the formula σr+kn (x) + σr+kn (y) = 1.
   ConsiderQthe translates of x defined by the formula xi = πi xπi−1 , i = 1, . . . ,r + an + 1,
               r+an
where πi = j=1      (j + (i − 1)(r + an), j). Note that supp(xi ) = {1 + (i − 1)(r + an), . . . ,

                                                   5
i(r + an)}. Since supp(xi ) are disjoint for distinct i, the elements xi commute. The lower
bound for k in the hypothesis of the theorem makes all xi belong to KG(r + kn).
    We have the relations

                             yM ⊂ N,       xi N = 0,    yN 6= 0,                        (2)

which follow from the first two equalities (1) and Lemma 2.
   Choose an arbitrary m ∈ M \ N and prove that x1 · · · xr+an+1 m ∈     / N. Assume the
contrary. Then σr+kn (x1 )· · · σr+kn (xr+an+1 )m = 0, where m is the image of m under the
projection M → M/N. Hence by the last formula of (1) and Lemma 2, we obtain

                     σr+kn (xi )m = σr+kn (πi )σr+kn (x)σr+kn (πi−1 )m =

                     σr+kn (πi )σr+kn (x)eλ+(kn ) σr+kn (πi−1 )m = m.

This implies m = 0, which leads to a contradiction.
   Denote by P the KG(r + kn)-module generated by x1 · · · xr+an+1 m. Let us calculate
what yP is. Let α ∈ G(r + kn). The cardinality of supp(α−1 yα) does not exceed r + an.
Thus there is an i = 1, . . . , r + an + 1 such that α−1 yα and xi commute. We have

                     yαx1 · · · xr+an+1 m ∈ αxi (α−1 yα)M ⊂ αxi N = 0.

Thus yP = 0. Since yN 6= 0, we have P ∩ N = 0 and M = P ⊕ N.                           
   By induction on the length one can easily prove that under the hypothesis of Theorem 1
any KG(r + kn)-module M of a finite length such that one of its composition factors is
                     n
isomorphic to D λ+(k ) and the remaining factors are degenerate, contains a submodule
                    n
isomorphic to D λ+(k ) .


                                     4. Examples
    We proved Theorem 1 under the assumption that λ satisfies Condition 1. In this section
we are going to give two examples of such partitions.
    Example 1. Suppose n < p. For any positive integer R we put C0 (R) = {λ ∈ Λ+         R :
                                                                             +
λ1 − λn ≤ p − n}. Lemma 12(2) of [6] asserts that in the case where µ ∈ ΛR \ C0 (R), the
module P (µ)⊗E does not have a direct summand isomorphic to P (ν), where ν ∈ C0 (R+1).
It obviously follows from this fact that for any i the module P (µ) ⊗ E i does not have a
direct summand isomorphic to P (ν), where ν ∈ C0 (R + i).
    Choose an arbitrary λ of C0 (r) and prove that this partition satisfies Condition 1.

Lemma 3. Let R ≥ (n − 1)(p − n) + 1 and µ be a degenerate partition of Λ+
                                                                        R . Then
µ∈/ C0 (R).

Proof. We have (n−1)µ1 ≥ µ1 +· · · +µn−1 = R > (n−1)(p−n). Hence µ1 −µn = µ1 > p−n
and µ ∈/ C0 (R).                                                                      
   Choose any, for example minimal, a satisfying the inequality r +an ≥ (n−1)(p−n)+1.
Then by [6, Lemma 12(2)] and Lemma 3 the partition λ satisfies Condition 1 for a defined
above. Thus Theorem 1 is applicable to λ. However taking into account that we consider
the special case n < p, the estimate of this theorem can be sharpened.
Theorem 2. Let λ ∈ C0 (r), λn ≥ (n − 1)(p − n) + 2 and µ be a degenerate partition of
Λ+                                                     λ       µ
 r . Then any KG(r)-module M of length 2 with factors D and D is decomposable.


                                              6
Proof differs from that of Theorem 1 mainly by the choice of x and y. Similarly to
Theorem 1 we assume without loss of generality that there is a submodule N ⊂ M such
that N ∼   = D µ and        ∼ λ
                   P M/N = D . For brevity, we−1   put R = (n − 1)(p − n) + 1.             Q
     Let x = n! σ∈G(n) sgn(σ)σ and xi = πi gπi , i = 1, . . . ,R + 1, where πi = nj=1(j +
                 1

(i − 1)n, j). Choose y ∈ KG(R) so as to have σR (y) = dR . Then σr (y) = fr,R (dR ). By [6,
Lemma 12(2)] and Lemma 3 we obtain σr (y)eλ = 0. The first and the third of formulas (2)
can be checked similarly to what was done in Theorem 1. The second formula follows from
the fact that µ contains no more than n − 1 nonzero parts. From the direct construction
of D λ as a quotient module of the Specht module S λ and from the inequality λn ≥ R + 1
it follows that there exists some m ∈ M such that x1 · · · xR+1 m ∈        / N. Denote by P the
KG(r)-submodule of M generated by x1 · · · xR+1 m and similarly to Theorem 1 show that
yP = 0. Hence M = P ⊕ N.                                                                            
                                                                                 +
     Example 2. Suppose n = 2. Choose an arbitrary λ ∈ Λ+          r . Let µ ∈ Λ r+1  be a  partition
such that P (µ) is a direct summand of P (λ) ⊗ E. Suppose that k is a positive integer such
that λ1 − λ2 ≥ pk − 1. Let us prove that in this case µ1 − µ2 ≥ pk − 1. The proof proceeds
by applying the formulas for the product of tilting modules form [4, Section 1]. These
formulas deal with tilting modules over SL2 (K). However, it is clear that if a true formula
                                                                                   ′ r+1−s′
of the form T (s)⊗T (1) = T (s′ ) is replaced by P (( r+s
                                                       2
                                                          , r−s
                                                             2
                                                                ))⊗E = P (( r+1+s
                                                                                2
                                                                                     , 2 )), then
we have a true formula again. In what follows we will take account of such reformulations
while citing formulas of [4].
     For brevity, we put m = λ1 − λ2 and m′ = µ1 − µ2 . We assume m P              > 0 and k > 0,
since in the contrary case the assertion being proved is obvious. Let m = ∞                  s
                                                                                     s=0 is p , where
0 ≤ is ≤ p − 1, be the p-addic expansion of m.
     If i0 = p − 1 then by [4, Lemma 1.5(1)] we have m′ = m + 1 ≥ pk . If 0 ≤ i0 ≤ p − 3 (the
case p > 2) then m ≥ pk . By [4, Lemma 1.5(2),(3)] we have m′ = m + 1 or m′ = m − 1.
In both cases we have m′ ≥ pk − 1.
     Now suppose that i0 = p − 2. Denote by   Pt∞the positive     integer such that is = p − 1 for
                                                           s−t−1
s = 1, . . . , t−1 and it < p−1. We put σ = s=t+1 is p           . Then m+2 = (it +1)pt +σpt+1 .
     Case p > 2. For the calculation we will use [4, Lemma 1.7.3]. To prove the inequality
m ≥ pk − 1 it suffices to prove that m + 1 − 2pt−1 ≥ pk − 1 and that m + 1 − 2pt ≥ pk − 1
   ′

for it = 1 and σ > 0 for it ≥ 2.
     Suppose that t < k. Since m ≥ pk , we have ik′ > 0 for some k ′ ≥ k. Hence m + 2 ≥
(it + 1)pt + pk and m + 1 − 2pt−1 ≥ pk − 1 + pt − 2pt−1 > pk − 1. If it ≥ 1 then
m + 1 − 2pt ≥ pk − 1 + (it − 1)pt ≥ pk − 1.
     Suppose that t = k. Since m ≥ pk , we have ik > 0 and σ = 0 or σ > 0. In the
first case m + 2 ≥ 2pk and m + 1 − 2pt−1 ≥ 2pk − 1 − 2pk−1 > pk − 1. In addition, if
ik ≥ 2 then m + 2 ≥ 3pk and m + 1 − 2pt ≥ pk − 1. In the second case m + 2 ≥ 3pk and
m + 1 − 2pt ≥ pk − 1.
     Suppose t > k. Since m + 2 ≥ pt , we have m + 1 − 2pt−1 ≥ pt−1 − 1 ≥ pk − 1. If σ > 0
or it ≥ 2, then m + 2 ≥ 3pt and m + 1 − 2pt ≥ pt − 1 > pk − 1.
     Case p = 2. For the calculation we will use [4, Lemma 1.7.2]. In this case to prove
the inequality m′ ≥ 2k − 1 it suffices to prove that m + 1 − 2t−1 ≥ 2k − 1 and that
m + 1 − 2t ≥ 2k − 1 for σ > 0.
     Suppose t < k. Similarly to the case p > 2 we obtain m + 2 ≥ 2t + 2k . Hence
m + 1 − 2t ≥ 2k − 1.
     Suppose t = k. Similarly to the case p > 2 we obtain ik > 0 or σ > 0. In both cases
we have m + 2 ≥ 2k+1 and m + 1 − 2t ≥ 2k+1 − 1 − 2k = 2k − 1.
     Suppose t > k. Since m + 2 ≥ 2t , we have m + 1 − 2t−1 ≥ 2t−1 − 1 ≥ 2k − 1. If σ > 0
then m + 2 ≥ 2t+1 and m + 1 − 2t ≥ 2t − 1 > 2k − 1.


                                                 7
    Now we are ready to check Condition 1 for any partition λ ∈ Λ+     r . Choose any, for
example minimal, k such that λ1 − λ2 < pk − 1 and put a = pk − 1 − r. From the above
calculations one can see that Condition 1 is satisfied for a we have chosen.


                              5. Finite basis property
    Let us study what consequences of the results of Section 4 one can get as far as the
operation ↑ introduced in [8] is concerned.
    For any KG(r)-module V we denote by d(V ) the dual module of V . In addition, there
exists the nondegenerate form h , i : V × d(V ) → K such that hσv, ui = hv, σ −1 ui for any
v ∈ V , u ∈ d(V ) and σ ∈ G(r). For a subset A of V or of d(V ) we denote by V ⊥ the set
{u ∈ d(V ) : hA, ui = 0} or the set {v ∈ V : hv, Ai = 0} respectively.

Lemma 4. Let λ be a p-regular nondegenerate partition of Λ+ r and V be a proper submod-
                          λ
ule of the Specht module S . Consider the following conditions:

  1) V ↓↑    V.

  2) There is a KG(r)-module L and a nonisomorphic embedding ι : d(S λ /V ) → L such
     that Im ι is an essential submodule of L and all composition factors of L/ Im ι are
     degenerate.

   Condition 2) always follows from Condition 1). The reverse implication is true for
n < p.

Proof. 1)⇒2) Define L = d(S λ /V ↓↑) and ι to be the embedding induced by the projection
S λ /V ↓↑ → S λ /V . From the obvious equality V ↓↑↓ = V ↓ (see Introduction) and [8,
Theorem 5(a)] it follows that V /V ↓↑. Therefore all composition factors of L/ Im ι are
also degenerate. It remains to show that Im ι is an essential submodule of L. Let N be a
submodule of L and N ∩ Im ι = 0. Then we have N ⊥ + (V /V ↓↑) = S λ /V ↓↑. Since P λ /V ↓↑
is a unique maximal submodule of S λ /V ↓↑ and V ⊂ P λ, we have N ⊥ = S λ /V ↓↑. Hence
N = 0.
     2)⇒1) subject to n < p. Without loss of generality we may assume that L/ Im ι ∼     = Dµ,
where µ is a degenerate p-regular partition.
     In the remaining part of the proof we will follow the definitions of [5]. Choose an
arbitrary N ≥ r and put G = G(r), S = SK (N, r), ω = (1r , 0N −r ), e = ξω . Let us fix the
sequence u(r) = (1, . . . , r). The map ξu(r)π,u(r) → π defines an isomorphisms of the rings
eSe and KG. Thus we may consider any KG-module as an eSe-module and vice versa.
     Let Vλ′ ,K be the Weyl module with highest weight λ′ . In the paper [5] the isomor-
                                                                       ′
phism (6.3d) was used to establish an isomorphism of Vλω′ ,K and d(S λ ) (S T,K in the notation
of [5]).
     Let Ks denote the sign representation of G. There is the standard embedding of V ⊗Ks
           ′
into d(S λ ) and therefore into Vλω′ ,K . Denote by V ′ the image of V under this embedding.
     Put U = SV ′ . This module is a submodule of Vλ′ ,K . The paper [5] introduces the left
S-modules Dλ′ ,K and AK (N, r). The last module is also a right S-module. In addition
                             ′
Dλ′ ,K is a submodule of λAK (N, r) that is a right weight space of AK (N, r).
     According to [5, Section 5.1] the restriction of the natural form h , i defined on E ⊗r
gives a nondegenerate contravariant form ( , ) : Vλ′ ,K × Dλ′ ,K → K. Put W = {w ∈
Dλ′ ,K : (U, w) = 0}. The module W is the contravariant dual to Vλ′ ,K /U in the sense of [5,

                                              8
Section 2.7]. Therefore eW is dual to Vλω′ ,K /V ′ as a KG-module in the usual sense (see [5,
                                     = S λ /V ⊗ Ks . Thus eW ∼
page 92 ]). In addition Vλω′ ,K /V ′ ∼                          = d(S λ /V ) ⊗ Ks . Consider any
                              λ
isomorphism θ : eW → d(S /V ) ⊗ Ks . We put M = L ⊗ Ks and ϕ = (ι ⊗ iKs )θ. Clearly,
ϕ is an embedding of eW to M. In addition, Im ϕ is an essential submodule of M and
M/ Im ϕ ∼  = D µ ⊗ Ks .
     Put h(M) = Se ⊗eSe M. Denote by W ′ the K-subspace of h(M) spanned by the
elements of the form se ⊗ ϕ(ew), where s ∈ S and w ∈ W . Clearly, W ′ is an S-module.
Consider the map ψ : W ′ → W defined by the formula ψ(se ⊗ ϕ(ew)) = sew.
                   ′
     Since W ⊂ λAK (N, r) and the latter module is injective, there exists an extension
                ′
ψ : h(M) → λAK (N, r) of ψ. Consider the isomorphism ε : M → eh(M) defined by the
formula ε(m) = e ⊗ m. Let τ = ψε be their composition. It is obvious that τ ϕ = ieW .
Therefore τ isomorphically takes Im ϕ to eW . Since Im ϕ is an essential submodule of M,
                                                 ′
we have that τ is an embedding of M in e λAK (N, r).
                     ′                                      ′
     The module e λAK (N, r) can be identified with M λ in the notation of [1]. Then eDλ′ ,K
                                               ′
is identified with the Specht module S λ . Applying the results of [1, Section 17], we
                                         ′
obtain that there is a filtration of e λAK (N, r)/eDλ′ ,K with factors isomorphic to S ν , where
ν ⊲ λ′ . Therefore either τ (M) ⊂ eDλ′ ,K or some S ν , where ν ⊲ λ′ , contains a submodule
isomorphic to D µ ⊗ Ks .
     Let us show that the latter case is impossible. Since S ν ⊂ M ν (see [1]) and the
            µ               ν
modules D  P ⊗ Ks and M are self-dual,        there exists an epimorphism π : M ν → D µ ⊗ Ks .
                                       ′
Put g = σ∈G(n) σ. Since ν ⊲ λ , we have ν1 ≥ n. It follows from this fact and from
n < p that M ν has a cyclic generator of the form gv, where v ∈ M ν . Applying π, we
obtain π(gv) = gπ(v) ∈ g(D µ ⊗ Ks ) = 0. The last equality follows from the fact that µ is
degenerate. This leads to a contradiction.
     Thus we have obtained that eW ⊂ τ (M) ⊂ eDλ′ ,K . Applying the form ( , ) and
multiplying by Ks , we obtain that there exists some submodule V0 of V such that V /V0 ∼        =
D µ . By [8, Corollary 6]we have V ↓↑ V .                                                       
     Note. In the first part of the proof it is possible to consider an arbitrary field, while in
the second part the field should be infinite. However, the second part is given only for an
illustration of the relation between properties 1) and 2) and is never used in the present
paper.
     For any p-regular partition ν, we denote by P ν the unique maximal submodule of the
                                                                                               n
Specht module S ν . One can easily check that if ν is nondegenerate, then P ν ↓ = P ν−(1 ) .
Now by the first part of Lemma 4, we have that under the hypothesis of Theorems 1 and 2
the equalities
                                     n             n          n
                            P λ+(k−1 ) ↑ = P λ+(k ) , P λ−(1 ) ↑ = P λ                        (3)
hold respectively. If K is not algebraically close, then applying the natural isomorphism
 ν
SK  ⊗K ∼  = SKν
                which takes PKν ⊗ K to PKν we obtain formulas (3) for any field of the same
characteristic. It follows from these formulas that for any λ satisfying Condition 1, there
exists finitely many relations defining all irreducible modules D λ+(k ) ∼
                                                                      n          n         n
                                                                         = S λ+(k ) /P λ+(k ) ,
k ∈ N.
