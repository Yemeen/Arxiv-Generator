                                                                                                    Abstract
                                                           We introduce a new class of simple Lie algebras W (n, m) (see Definition 1)
                                                       that generalize the Witt algebra by using ”exponential” functions, and also a
                                                       subalgebra W ∗ (n, m) thereof; and we show each derivation of W ∗ (1, 0) can be
                                                       written as a sum of an inner derivation and a scalar derivation (Theorem. 2)
                                                       [10]. The Lie algebra W (n, m) is Z-graded and is infinite growth [4].


                                             1         Introduction
                                             Let F be a field of characteristic zero. Let us start by recalling the general algebra
                                             W + (n). (For more details, please refer to [14].)
                                                The Lie algebra W (n) has a basis

                                                                        {xi11 · · · xinn ∂k     | i1 , · · · , in ∈ Z, 1 ≤ k ≤ n},

                                             and a Lie bracket on basis elements given by

                                                                                [xi11 · · · xinn ∂k , xj11 · · · xjnn ∂t ]                       (1)
                                                                                                                 ik+1 +jk+1
                                                                          =     jk x1i1 +j1 · · · xikk +jk −1 xk+1           · · · xinn +jn ∂t
                                                                                                               it+1 +jt+1
                                                                          −     it x1i1 +j1 · · · xtit +jt −1 xt+1        · · · xinn +jn ∂k

                                             where ∂t is the partial derivative with respect to xt , 1 ≤ t ≤ n.
                                                It is well known that the Witt algebra W + (n) is defined to be the subalgebra of
                                             W (n), with the basis

                                                                   {xi11 · · · xinn ∂k    | i1 , · · · , in ∈ Z + ∪ {0}, 1 ≤ k ≤ n}.

                                                 In [5] Kawamoto generalizes Witt algebras; we call the algebra W (G, I) in
                                             [5] Kawamoto algebra. Dokovic and Zhao [2] show that their algebras generalize
                                             Kawamoto algebras. But their algebras are different from our algebras because their
                                             algebras have ad semi-simple elements (see [2]), whereas our algebras have none .

   The main results of this paper are following:
Theorem 1 The Lie algebras W (n, m), W (n, m, r, s) and W ∗ (n, m) are simple Lie
algebras.

(See Definition 1, Definition 2 and Definition 3.)

Theorem 3 Each derivation of W ∗ (1, 0) is a sum of an inner derivation and a scalar
derivation.


2     Generalized Witt algebras
We now give the definition of the algebra W (n, m).
Definition 1 For any pair of natural numbers n, m, define the Lie algebra W (n, m)
to be the algebra spanned linearly by a basis

with Lie bracket on basis elements given by

                                                                                     ∂j

                                                                                     xi ∂j

               −    aj e              ···e               x1        · · · xm+n         ∂i

where bi = 0 if n + 1 ≤ i ≤ n + m, and aj = 0 if n + 1 ≤ j ≤ n + m (1).

Definition 2 Define W ∗ (n, m) to be the Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra W (n, m)
spanned by the basis
                                                                                b

                                                                             m+n
                                                                                 ∂i                                 (3)
where a1 , · · · , an ∈ Z, b1 , · · · , bm+n ∈ N, and 1 ≤ i ≤ m + n.

Remarks: It can be checked that the Lie bracket of any two such basis elements pro-
duces a linear combination of the same form.
Definition 3 Define W (n, m, r, s) as the Lie subalgebra of W (n, m) spanned by the
basis

where N is the set of non-negative integers and r ≤ n ∈ N, s ≤ m ∈ N.

                                                               2
   W (0, s + r, 0, r) is the Lie subalgebra of W (n, m) spanned by the basis
                                       i            i

where r, s ∈ N.
     Note that the Lie algebra W (0, s, 0, r) is isomorphic to a Lie algebra in the class
   ∗
W of [11].
Let Z k denotes the product of k factors of Z. We consider an n−tuple α = (a1 , · · · , an ) ∈
Z n and an (n + m)−tuple β = (b1 , · · · , bn+m ) ∈ Z n+m . If we put

                                           eα := ea1 x1 · · · ean xn

and
                                                                    b
                                           xβ := xb11 · · · xm+n

                                                                 ,
then any element l in W (n, m) has the form
                                                X
                                           l=           aα,β,p eα xβ ∂p ,
                                                α,β,p


for aα,β,p ∈ F . Let us write eaxi ∂p = eaǫi ∂p , and xbi ∂p = xbǫi ∂p , for 1 ≤ p ≤ n + m,
where a, b ∈ Z.
    The Lie algebra W (n, m) has a Z k −gradation for 1 ≤ k ≤ n as follows:
                                                              M
                                    W (n, m) =                              W(a1 ,···,ak )                  (4)
                                                        (a1 ,···,ak )∈Z k


where W(a1 ,···,ak ) is a subspace of W (n, m) with basis

                {eαx xβ ∂k | α = (a1 , · · · , ak , ak+1 , · · · , an ) ∈ Z n , β ∈ Z n+m ,
                1 ≤ k ≤ n + m}.

Let us call Wα the α-homogeneous component of W (n, m) and elements in Wα the α-
homogeneous elements. Note that the (0, · · · , 0)-homogeneous component is isomorphic
to the Witt algebra W (n + m). From now on let us denote the (0, · · · , 0)-homogeneous
component as the 0-homogeneous component.
    We introduce a lexicographic ordering of the basis elements of W (n, m) as follows:
                                                                b

                 we have l1 ≥ l2
                 if (a1 , · · · , an , b1 , · · · , bn+m , p) ≥ (c1 , · · · , cn , d1 , · · · , dn+m , q)

by the natural lexicographic ordering in Z n × Z n+m × Z.

Let us define the string number st(l) = s for l.
For any l ∈ W (n, m), let us define a largest power lp(a1 ,···,an ) (l) as the largest power of
polynomials in (a1 , · · · , an )-homogeneous elements.

Similarily for any l ∈ W (n, m), we can define a largest power lpl (l) as the largest power
of polynomials in l-homogeneous elements.

For the sake of clarity, from now on we generally omit subsripts.
Lemma 1 If l ∈ W (n, m) is any non-zero element then the ideal < l > generated by
l contains an element l′ whose powers of polynomial parts are positive integers.
Proof. Since l is a non-zero element of W (n, m), there is a non-zero α-homogeneous
component. Then we can take an element s = xu ∂i with large positive integers u ∈
Z n+m such that l′ = [s, l] 6= 0. ✷

Lemma 2 If an ideal I of W (n, m) contains any ∂i where (1 ≤ i ≤ n + m), then
I = W (n, m).

Proof. Since the Witt algebra W (n + m) is simple [5],[11],[14] and ∂i ∈ I, the Witt
algebra W (n+m) ⊂ I. For any basis element eα xβ ∂t of W (n, m), we can assume ak 6= 0
for some k ∈ {1, · · · , n} because if all ak = 0, then the basis xβ ∂t ∈ W (n + m) where
W (n + m) is a simple Lie algebra [5], [11].
If β = (0, · · · , 0), then there is ak 6= 0. We have

                                  [∂k   ,        eα ∂t ] = ak eα ∂t ∈ I.

   For any basis element eα xβ ∂t such that au 6= 0 for 1 ≤ u ≤ n, we have

                             [∂u , eα xβ ∂t ] = au eα xβ ∂t + bu eα xβ−ǫu ∂t .             (7)


                      [eau ǫu ∂u , eα−au ǫu xβ ∂t ] = bu eα xβ−ǫu ∂t − δu,t at eα xβ ∂u    (8)

where δu,t is the Knonecker delta.

                                                       4
Case I. If u 6= t,
                                        (7) − (8) = au eα xβ ∂t ∈ I.
Case II. If u = t,
                                       (7) − (8) = 2au eα xβ ∂t ∈ I.
    Therefore, we have proved the lemma.                    ✷

Theorem 1 The Lie algebras W (n, m), W (n, m, r, s) and W ∗ (n, m) are simple Lie
algebras.

Proof. If I is a non-zero ideal of W (n, m), (or W ∗ (n, m) or W (n, m, r, s)) then by
Lemma 1 there is a non-zero element l in I such that all the polynomial parts are
positive powers. We show that I = W (n, m) by induction on st(l).
If st(l) = 1, then l can be written as follows:

                                  l = c1 eα xβ1 ∂j1 + · · · + ct eα xβt ∂jt ,

where c1 , · · · , ct ∈ F α = (a1 , · · · , an ) ∈ Z n , and β1 , · · · , βm+n ∈ Z n+m . If α = (0, · · · , 0),
then l ∈ W0n = W (n + m) and I ∩ W (n + m) is a non-zero ideal of W (n + m). Thus,
W (n + m) ⊂ I by the simplicity of W (n + m) and I = W (n, m) by Lemma 2.
If α = (a1 , · · · , an ) 6= (0, · · · , 0), then without loss of generality we can assume a1 6= 0.
Then,

                           l1 = [e−α ∂1 , c1 eα xβ1 ∂j1 + · · · + ct eα xβt ∂jt ]                        (10)
                         = c1 aj1 xβ1 ∂1 + c1 a1 xβ1 ∂j1 + c1 b11 xβ1 −ǫ1 ∂j1
                         + ···
                         + c1 ajt xβt ∂1 + c1 a1 xβt ∂jt . + c1 bt1 xβt −ǫ1 ∂jt .

If aj1 6= 0 and j1 = 1, then we have from (10),

                               l1 = 2a1 c1 xβ1 ∂1 + c2 aj2 xβ2 ∂1                                        (11)
                             + ···
                             + ct ajt xβt ∂1 + c1 b11 xβ1 −ǫ1 ∂1
                             + c2 b21 xβt −ǫ1 ∂j2 + · · · + ct bt1 xβt −ǫ1 ∂jt =
                                                                               6 0,

                                                        5
since 2a1 c1 6= 0 and the maximality of xβ1 ∂1 . Since l1 ∈ W (n+m), we have I = W (n, m)
by the simplicity of W (n + m) and by Lemma 2.
If aj1 6= 0 and j1 6= 1, then from (10),

                        l1 = c1 aj1 xβ1 ∂1 + c1 a1 xβ1 ∂j1 + c1 b1 xβ1 −ǫ1 ∂j1                              (12)
                      + ···
                      + ct ajt xβt ∂1 + ct a1 xβt ∂jt + ct bt1 xβt −ǫ1 ∂jt .

If aj1 6= 0 and j1 6= 1, then c1 aj1 xβ1 ∂1 is the non-zero maximal element by the ordering
in l1 . Thus, l1 is a non-zero element of I ∩ W (n + m) and it follows I = W (n, m) as
the above case.
If aj1 = 0 and j1 = 1, then from (10)

                                 l1 = c2 aj2 xβ1 ∂1 + · · · + ct ajt xβt ∂1                                 (13)
                            +    ···
                            +    c1 a1 xβt ∂j1 + c1 b11 xβ1 −ǫ1 ∂j1
                            +    ···
                            +    ct a1 xβt ∂jt + ct b1t xβt −ǫ1 ∂jt .

Since l1 6= 0, xβ1 > xβ2 by assumption.
We can assume aj1 = 0. Then from (10) the term c1 a1 xβ1 ∂j1 is maximal in l1 , so that
element of I ∩ W (n + m) has a non-zero element. In this case as before I = W (n, m).
Let n ≥ 2 and suppose that I = W (n, m) for an ideal I containing a non-zero element
l with st(l) 6= n − 1.
Let l ∈ I and st(l) = n. Then l can be written as follows:
                                              X
                                        l=           cα,β,k eα xβ ∂k + · · ·                                (14)

                                        ψ,p

where α > · · · > φ and β > (0, · · · , 0) and ψ > (0, · · · , 0) by Lemma 1.
    If some terms with e0 occur in (14), then we can assume there is au 6= 0 for some
u in α = (a1 , · · · , au , · · · , an ). Let

                                 l2 = [∂u , [∂u , [· · · , [∂u , l] · · ·]

where we applied Lie bracket (lp(l) + 1)-times. Then the (0, · · · , 0)−homogeneous part
is zero , st(l2 ) = n − 1 and l2 6= 0 by Lemma 3. Thus, we have I = W (n, m) by
induction hypothesis.
If φ = (h1 , · · · , hn ) 6= (0, · · · , 0), then we have hu 6= 0 for some l ≤ u ≤ n. Then we

l3 is non-zero by the argument similar to the case st(l) = 1. If the (α −ψ)-homogeneous
component is zero, then we can apply the induction hypothesis to have I = W (n, m).
If the (α − ψ)-homogeneous component is non-zero, then we have

                                             l4 = [∂j , · · · , [∂j , l3 ] · · ·]

the Lie bracket (lp(l) + 1)-times. Then l4 has no (0, · · · , 0)−homogeneous components,
and we can apply induction hypothesis to have I = W (n, m). This completes the proof.

1, · · · , n + m} and ǫt = (0, · · · , 0, 1, 0, · · · , 0), is an ad-semisimple element of W (0, m).

W (n, m) has a subalgebra W (n) where n comes from the exponential parts. Thus xǫt ∂t
is the candidate of ad-semisimple elements for t ∈ {1, · · · , n}. But

                             [e−ǫt ∂t       ,     xǫt ∂t ] = e−ǫt ∂t + e−ǫt xǫt ∂t .

This shows xǫt ∂t can not be an ad semisimple element of W (n, m). Thus we have the
following proposition.

Proposition 1 The Lie algebra W (n, m) has an m−dimensional maximal torus which
has the basis {xǫt ∂t |   n + 1 ≤ t ≤ n + m} with respect to the basis (??).

Proof. Let l be an ad-semisimple element with respect to the basis (??). Then l can
be written as follows:                 X
                                    l=    fi ∂i .
                                                             i

Then for any j                        X
                                            ∂j (fi )∂i = [∂j , l] ∈ F ∂j .
                                        i

So ∂j (fi ) = 0 for j 6= i and ∂i (fi ) = ai ∈ F. It follows that ∂j (fi − ai xi ) = 0 for all i, j.
So fi − ai xi is a constant. Say fi − ai xi = bi . Thus fi = ai xi + bi with ai , bi ∈ F.

                                                             8
    Next
                                                              X
                                   [xj ∂j , l] = [xj ∂j ,           (ai xi + bi )∂i ]
                                                                i
                              = (aj xj − (aj xj + bj ))∂j = −bj ∂j
                                                    P
is a multiple of xj ∂j . Thus bj = 0 and l =             i   ai xi ∂i .
    Finally if j ≤ n, then
                                                                     X
                                      [exj ∂j , l] = [exj ∂j ,            ai xi ∂i ]
                                                                      i
                                 = exj (aj − aj xj )∂j
is a scalar multiple of exj ∂j so aj = 0.
             Pn+m
    Thus l = i=n+1    ai xi ∂i . ✷
Obviously we have following corollary.
Corollary 1 The Lie algebra W (n, 0) has no ad-diagonal element with respect to the
basis
          {ea1 x1 · · · ean xn xb11 · · · xbnn ∂i |a1 , · · · , an , b1 , · · · , bn ∈ Z, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.
    Consider the Lie subalgebra W + (1, 0) of W (n, 0) which is spanned by
                                     {eax xi ∂     | a, i ∈ N}
This is a subalgebra of W (1, 0) and we have the following proposition.
Proposition 2 The Lie algebra W + (1, 0) is a non-simple Lie algebra [4].
Proof. Consider the subalgebra Im which is spanned by
                                  {eax xi ∂        |a ≥ m, i ∈ N}
where m ≥ 0 and a is any fixed positive integer. Then Im is a non-trivial ideal of
W + (1, 0). ✷
This proposition shows that if we want a simple Lie algebra, we need to include the
terms of the form eax xi ∂ where a can be any negative integer . We have proved that
the Lie algebra W (1, 0) is simple from Theorem 1.
   We have the following Lie embedding:
                             W (1) ⊂ W (2) ⊂ · · · ⊂ W (m) ⊂ · · · ,
                         W (1, 1) ⊂ W (1, 2) ⊂ · · · ⊂ W (1, m) ⊂ · · · ,
                                                   ···
                         W (n, 1) ⊂ W (n, 2) ⊂ · · · ⊂ W (n, m) ⊂ · · · .

Let us study a simple Lie algebra which has no toral element. Let 0 6= q ∈ C,
the complex numbers, be a fixed non-root of unity (q n 6= 1 for any n ∈ N). The
skew polynomial ring Cq [x, y], where yx = qxy, has been called the quantum plane.
The quantum plane can be localized at the Ore set of powers of x, y to give a non-
commutative associative ring of Laurent polynomials Cq [x, y, x−1 , y −1] [8].

                                                    9
Proposition 3 [8] The Lie algebra of derivations of Cq [x, y, x−1 , y −1] is generated by
the inner derivations and the derivations Dα,β (xi y j ) = (αi + βj)xi y j .
Proof. See Theorem 1.2 of [8] on page 3757. ✷
   Let Vq be the Lie algebra of inner derivations on Cq [x, y, x−1 , y −1]. Clearly
{ad(xh y k )|(h, k) ∈ Z x Z − {(0, 0)}} forms a basis of Vq , and
                            [ad(xh y k ), ad(xr y s )] = ad([xh y k , xr y s ]).

Proposition 4 The Lie algebra Vq is a simple Lie algebra.
Proof. This case is Theorem 1.3 of [8].             ✷

    Let us consider the Lie algebra V̄q on Cq [x, x−1 , y, y −1] with a different viewpoint
from Kirkman, Processi and Small’s idea [8].
    The Lie algebra V̄q has a basis {xi y j | i, j ∈ Z} and a Lie bracket on the basis
given by
                          [xi y j , xl y m ] = xi y j xl y m − xl y m xi y j
for any pair of basis elements xi y j , xl y m ∈ V̄q .
Corollary 2 Vq ∼
               = V̄q .
Proof. It is straightforward. ✷
Consider the Lie algebra V̄ which is spanned by
                                         {(a, i) | a, i ∈ Z}
with Lie bracket
                            [(a, i), (b, j)] = (q bi − q aj )(a + b, i + j).

Proposition 5 Vq ∼
                 = V̄ .
Proof. Define the F -linear map θ from Vq to V̄ by θ(ad(xh y k )) = (h, k). Then clearly θ
is a bijective Lie algebra homomorphism . Therefore, we have proved the proposition.
✷
Corollary 3 V̄ ∼
               = Vq ∼
                    = V̄q .
Proof. It is straightforward.        ✷

Let us study V̄ more closely. (0, 0) is a basis of the center of V̄ , since [(0, 0), (a, i)] =
(0, 0) for any (a, i) ∈ V̄ . Let (h, k) be the toral element of V̄ , then for any (a, i) ∈ V̄ ,
                      [(h, k), (a, i)] = (q ka − q hi )(a + h, i + k) = f (a, i)
for some f ∈ C. Thus (h, k) = (0, 0). This contradicts the simplicity of V̄ ∼
                                                                            = Vq . (0, 0)
cannot be a basis, thus, there is no toral element. The above argument shows that
V̄ cannot contain the Witt algebra W (1) or W + (1). Since W (n, m) contains W (1),
W (n, m) cannot be isomorphic to V̄ .

4     Derivations of W ∗(1, 0)
In this section we determine all the derivations of the Lie subalgebra W ∗ (1, 0) of
W ∗ (n, m). Ikeda and Kawamoto found all the derivations of the Kawamoto algebra
W (G, I) in their paper [7]. It is very important to find the derivations of a given Lie
algebra to compare with other Lie algebras. Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F .
An F -linear map D from L to L is a derivation if D([l1 , l2 ]) = [D(l1 ), l2 ] + [l1 , D(l2 )]
for any l1 , l2 ∈ L.
    Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F . Define the derivation D of L to be a scalar
derivation if for all basis elements l of L, D(l) = fl l where fl is a scalar depending on
l [1].
    Let d be any additive function of Z to F. Then it is to see that the linear
transformation Dd determined by the mapping of the basis elements of W ∗ (1, 0) by
Dd (eax xi ∂) = d(a)eax xi ∂ is a derivation of W ∗ (1, 0).
    In this section we consider the stable F -algebra F [e±x , x] in F [[x]] with F -algebra
basis {eax xi |a ∈ Z, i ∈ N} [4].
    Let us calculate all the derivations of the Lie subalgebra W ∗ (1, 0) of W (n, m). We
need the following lemma for the main theorem.

Lemma 4 Let D be a derivation of W ∗ (1, 0). If D(∂) = 0, then D = f ad∂ + S where
f ∈ F and S is a scalar derivation.

Proof. Let D be a derivation of W ∗ (1, 0) such that D(∂) = 0.
   We have

                                    D([∂, x∂]) = D(∂) = 0.                                (19)

On the other hand, this equals

                      D([∂, x∂]) = [D(∂), x∂] + [∂, D(x∂)] = [∂, D(x∂)].                  (20)

We can put D(x∂) = f ∂ for f ∈ F [e±x , x]. Then from (19) and (20),

                                0 = [∂, D(x∂)] = [∂, f ∂] = f ′ ∂.                        (21)

Since f is an analytic function satisfying f ′ = 0, we have f = c for c ∈ F. From (21)
we have D(x∂) = c∂.
   Inductively, we assume

                                       D(xn ∂) = ncxn−1 ∂                                 (22)

for n ∈ N.
We have

                      D([∂, xn+1 ∂]) = (n + 1)D(xn ∂) = n(n + 1)cxn−1 ∂.                  (23)

                                              11
On the other hand, this equals

             D([∂, xn+1 ∂]) = [D(∂), xn+1 ∂] + [∂, D(xn+1 ∂)] = [∂, D(xn+1 ∂)].   (24)

From (23) and (24), we have

                             D(xn+1 ∂) = φ∂ + (n + 1)cxn ∂

for some φ ∈ F.
Also we have

                   D([x∂, xn+1 ∂]) = nD(xn+1 ∂) = nφ∂ + n(n + 1)cxn ∂.            (25)

On the other hand, this equals

                    D([x∂, xn+1 ∂]) = [D(x∂), xn+1 ∂] + [x∂, D(xn+1 ∂)]           (26)
                  = c[∂, xn+1 ∂] + [x∂, φ∂ + (n + 1)cxn ∂]
                  = c(n + 1)xn ∂ − φ∂ + (n − 1)(n + 1)cxn ∂
                  = c(n + 1)nxn ∂ − φ∂.

From (25) and (26), we have φ = 0.
   Therefore, for any n ∈ N we have D(xn ∂) = ncxn−1 ∂.
   We have

                                    D([∂, ex ∂]) = D(ex ∂).                       (27)

On the other hand, this equals

                   D([∂, ex ∂]) = [D(∂), ex ∂] + [∂, D(ex ∂)] = [∂, D(ex ∂)].     (28)

From (27) and (28), we have

                                  ∂(D(ex ∂)) = D(ex ∂).

Thus, we have
                                     D(ex ∂) = dex ∂
for d ∈ F.
    Inductively assume D(epx ∂) = pdepx ∂ for 1 6= p ∈ N. We have

                             D([ex ∂, epx ∂]) = (p − 1)D(epx+x∂).                 (29)

On the other hand, this equals

                              [D(ex ∂), epx ∂] + [ex ∂, D(epx ∂)]                 (30)
                            = [dex ∂, epx ∂] + [ex ∂, pdepx ∂]
                            = (p − 1)(p + 1)depx+x ∂.

                                            12
From (29) and (30), we have

                              D(epx+x ∂) = d(p + 1)epx+x ∂.

Therefore, we have D(epx ∂) = pdepx ∂ for p ∈ N.
   Also we have

                                  D([∂, e−x ∂]) = −D(e−x ∂).                     (31)

On the other hand, this equals

                D([∂, e−x ∂]) = [D(∂), e−x ∂] + [∂, D(e−x ∂)] = [∂, D(e−x ∂)].   (32)

From (31) and (32), we have

                                 ∂(D(e−x ∂)) = D(e−x ∂).

Thus, we have
                                    D(e−x ∂) = he−x ∂
for h ∈ F.
    We have

                                 D([e−x ∂, ex ∂]) = 2D(∂) = 0.                   (33)

On the other hand, this equals

                    D([e−x ∂, ex ∂]) = [D(e−x ∂), ex ∂] + [e−x ∂, D(ex ∂)]       (34)
                  = [he−x ∂, ex ∂] + [e−x ∂, dex ∂].

From (33) and (34), we have h = −d.
   Inductively assume D(epx ∂) = pdepx ∂ where p is a fixed negative integer. We have

                           D([e−x ∂, epx ∂]) = (p + 1)D(epx−x ∂).                (35)

On the other hand, this equals

                            [D(e−x ∂), epx ∂] + [e−x ∂, D(epx ∂)]                (36)
                          = [−de−x ∂, epx ∂] + [e−x ∂, pdepx ∂]
                          = (p − 1)(p + 1)depx−x ∂.

From (35) and (36), we have D(epx ∂) = pdepx ∂ holds for any negative integer p.
Therefore, D(epx ∂) = pdepx ∂ holds for any p ∈ Z.
   Let us show by induction that

                         D(epx xn ∂) = dpepx xn ∂ + ncepx xn−1 ∂

for p ∈ Z and n ∈ N.

                                            13
    Inductively assume

                              D(epx xn ∂) = pdepx xn ∂ + ncepx xn−1 ∂

for any p ∈ Z and a fixed n ∈ N. We have

                      D([x∂, epx xn ∂]) = pD(epx xn+1 ∂) + (n − 1)D(epx xn ∂).           (37)

On the other hand, this equals

                                  [D(x∂), epx xn ∂] + [x∂, D(epx xn ∂)].                 (38)

From (37) and (38), we have

                     pD(epx xn+1 ∂) = −(n − 1)pdepx xn ∂ − (n − 1)ncepx xn−1 ∂           (39)
                +    pcepx xn ∂ + ncepx xn−1 ∂
                +    [x∂, pdepx xn ∂ + ncepx xn−1 ∂]
                =    −(n − 1)pdepx xn ∂ − n(n − 1)cepx xn−1 ∂ + pcepx xn ∂
                +    ncepx xn−1 ∂ + p2 depx xn+1 ∂ + p(n − 1)depx xn ∂
                +    pncepx xn ∂ + nc(n − 2)epx xn−1 ∂.

Therefore, we have

                        D(epx xn+1 ∂) = pdepx xn+1 ∂ + (n + 1)cepx xn ∂

for any p ∈ Z and any n ∈ N.
    Therefore, D = cad∂ + f S for an appropriate f ∈ F.                     ✷

Theorem 2 Each derivation of W ∗ (1, 0) can be written as a sum of an inner deriva-
tion and a scalar derivation.

Proof. Let D be any derivation of W ∗ (1, 0). Then D(∂) = f ∂ for some f ∈ F [e±x , x].
Since ∂ : F [e±x , x] → F [e±x , x] is onto map, there is a function g ∈ F [e±x , x] such that
∂(g) = f. Then ad∂ (g) = [∂, g∂] = f ∂ = D(∂). We have (D − adg∂ )(∂) = 0. By Lemma
4 we have D = adg∂ + cad∂ + S. Therefore, we have proven the theorem. ✷


5     Some comments on the generalized Witt algebra
Let F [x1 , x2 ] be a polynomial ring. Consider the derivations (x1 x2 ∂1 ) and (x1 x2 ∂2 ) on
F [x1 , x2 ] such that
                                 (x1 x2 ∂1 )(xi1 xj2 ) = xi1 x1+j
                                                              2 ,

for any xi1 xj2 ∈ F [x1 , x2 ] and similarly for (x1 x2 ∂2 ).
Consider the vector space L over F with basis

                          {xi1 xj2 (x1 x2 ∂1 ), xa1 xb2 (x1 x2 ∂2 )|a, b, i, j ∈ N}.

                                                     14
   Then we can define a bracket on the basis as follows [compare with (1)]:

            [xi11 xj21 (x1 x2 ∂1 ), xi12 xj22 (x1 x2 ∂1 )] = (i2 − i1 )x1i1 +i2 xj21 +j2 +1 (x1 x2 ∂1 )

and

                     [xi11 xj21 (x1 x2 ∂1 ), xa11 xb22 (x1 x2 ∂2 )]
                   = a1 xi11 +a1 x2j1 +b2 +1 (x1 x2 ∂2 ) − j1 xi11 +a1 +1 x2j1 +b2 (x1 x2 ∂1 )

and
           [xa11 x2b1 (x1 x2 ∂2 ), x1a2 xb22 (x1 x2 ∂2 )] = (b2 − b1 )xi11 +i2 +1 xj21 +j2 (x1 x2 ∂2 ),
and we extend linearly to L, but this bracket does not satisfy the Jacobi identity, since
(x1 x2 ∂1 ) and (x1 x2 ∂2 do not commute as derivations. Thus, it is important to find the
generalized derivations on the polynomial ring to make a Lie algebra. Please refer to
the paper [13] for the Witt-type algebra using generalized derivations on an associative,
commutative K-algebra where K is a field of any characteristic.

Following is a quite interesting conjecture on the Witt algebra [6],[14].
Conjecture. If θ is any automorphism of the Witt algebra W + (n), then θ(xi ∂i ) =
axj ∂j + b∂j , where 0 6= a ∈ F and b ∈ F.

It is not very difficult to prove this conjecture on W + (2) and W + (1).
    Following is a quite interesting conjecture on the derivations of W (n, m) and its
subalgebras.

Conjecture. Each derivation of W (n, m) can be written as a sum of an inner deriva-
tion and a scalar derivation.
