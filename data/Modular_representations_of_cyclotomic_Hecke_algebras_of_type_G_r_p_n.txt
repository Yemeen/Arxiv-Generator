                                                        We give a classification of the simple modules for the cyclotomic Hecke
                                                    algebras over C in the modular case. We use the unitriangular shape of
                                                    the decomposition matrices of Ariki-Koike algebras and Clifford theory.


                                             1      Introduction
                                             Let r, p and n be integers such that p divides r. The complex reflection group
                                             of type G(r, p, n) is defined to be the groups of n × n permutation matrices such
                                             that the entries are either 0 or rth roots of unity and the product of the nonzero
                                             entries is a rp -root of unity.
                                                 In [2] and [5], Ariki and Broué-Malle have defined a Hecke algebra associated
                                             to each complex reflection group G(r, p, n). It can be seen as a deformation of
                                             the algebra of the group G(r, p, n). According to a conjecture of Broué and
                                             Malle, such algebras, called cyclotomic Hecke algebras, should occur as endo-
                                             morphism algebras of the Lusztig induced character. The representation theory
                                             of cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type G(r, 1, n) (also known as Ariki-Koike alge-
                                             bras) is beginning to be well understood. They are cellular algebras, the simple
                                             modules have been classified in both semi-simple and modular cases and the
                                             decomposition matrices are known in characteristic 0 (see [21] for a survey of
                                             these results).
                                                 In [2], Ariki has shown that a Hecke algebra of type G(r, p, n) can be consid-
                                             ered as the 0-component of a graded system for a Hecke algebra of type G(r, 1, n)
                                             with a special choice of parameters. As a consequence, in the semi-simple case,
                                             he has given a complete set of non isomorphic simple modules by using Clifford
                                             theory. In the modular case, partial results have been obtained by Hu in [17]
                                             (see also [16] and [18] where the case r = p = 2 which corresponds to Hecke
                                             algebras of type Dn is studied). The main problem is that the restrictions of
                                             the simple modules for non semi-simple Ariki-Koike algebras are much more
                                             complicated to describe than for semi-simple ones.
                                                 The purpose of this paper is precisely to give a parametrization of the simple
                                             modules for the non semi-simple cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type G(r, p, n)

over C. It comes from the “canonical basic set” introduced by Geck and
Rouquier in [13] and extended by the second author in [20]. This set induces
a parametrization of the simple modules of non semi-simple Ariki-Koike alge-
bras by some FLOTW multipartitions (this kind of multipartitions has been
defined by Foda, Leclerc, Okado, Thibon and Welsh in [9]). We proceed in an
analogous way than in [14, Theorem 2.1], using the unitriangular shape of the
decomposition matrices of Ariki-Koike algebras and Clifford theory.

2.A      Cyclotomic Hecke algebras
                                                                               r
Let r, p and n be integers such that p divides r. We denote d :=                 . Let R be
                                                                               p
an integral ring, q a unit of R and a sequence x = (x1 , . . . , xd ) of elements in R.
Denote Hq,x
          r,p,n (R), the Hecke R-algebra associated to the complex reflection
group G(r, p, n), for the parameters q, x, defined by the following presenta-
tion:
 generators : a0 , . . . , an ,
 relations :      (a0 − x1 ) . . . (a0 − xd ) = 0
                  (ai − q)(ai + 1) = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
                  a1 a3 a1 = a3 a1 a3 ,
                  ai ai+1 ai = ai+1 ai ai+1 , 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
                  (a1 a2 a3 )2 = (a3 a1 a2 )2 ,
                  a1 ai = ai a1 , 4 ≤ i ≤ n,
                  ai aj = aj ai , 2 ≤ i < j ≤ n, j ≥ i + 2,
                                                                 r−2
                                                                 X
                  a0 a1 a2 = (q −1 a1 a2 )2−r a2 a0 a1 + (q − 1)     (q −1 a1 a2 )1−k a0 a1 ,
                                                                 i=1
                           = a1 a2 a0 ,
                  a0 ai = ai a0 , 3 ≤ i ≤ n.
    We have the following special cases:
    • if r = p = 1, Hq,x
                     r,p,n (R) is the Hecke algebra of type An−1 ,

    • if r = 2 and p = 1, Hq,x
                           r,p,n (R) is the Hecke algebra of type Bn ,

    • if r = p = 2, Hq,x
                     r,p,n (R) is the Hecke algebra of type Dn ,

    • if p = 1, Hq,x
                 r,p,n (R) is the Ariki-Koike algebra defined in [4].


    Suppose the ring R contains a pth root of unity ηp and a pth root yi of xi ,
for each i ∈ [1, d]. We define a sequence Q = (Q1 , . . . , Qr ) of elements in
R from the sequence x: for j ∈ [1, r], j = sp + t with s ∈ [0, d − 1] and
t ∈ [1, p], let Qj := ys+1 ηpt−1 . Then, Hq,Q    r,1,n (R) is the R-algebra defined by
 generators : T1 , . . . , Tn ,
 relations :     (T1p − x1 ) . . . (T1p − xd ) = 0,
                 (Ti − q)(Ti + 1) = 0, 2 ≤ i ≤ n,
                 T1 T2 T1 T2 = T2 T1 T2 T1 ,
                 Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 , 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
                 Ti Tj = Tj Ti , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, j ≥ i + 2.


                                             2
    We use [2, Proposition 1.6] and identify a0 with T1p , a1 with T1−1 T2 T1 and
ai with Ti , for i ∈ [2, n], such that Hq,x
                                          r,p,n (R) is considered as a subalgebra of
Hr,1,n (R). Then by [15, §4.1], the Ariki-Koike algebra Hq,Q
  q,Q
                                                              r,1,n (R) is graded over
the cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hq,x r,p,n (R) by a cyclic group of order p:

                                                  p−1
                                                  M
                              Hq,Q
                               r,1,n (R)     =          T1i Hq,x
                                                             r,p,n (R).
                                                  i=0



    Put H := Hq,Q                ′    q,x
              r,1,n (R) and H := Hr,p,n (R). We can define an automorphism
 H       ′
gH ′ of H by
                                    −1
                        H
                       gH ′ (h) := T1  hT1 , for all h ∈ H′ .
We also have an automorphism fHH′ of H which is defined on the grading by

                   fHH′ (T1 j h) = ηpj T1j h, for j ∈ [0, p − 1], h ∈ H′ .



    The next theorem of Dipper and Mathas will be very useful in the following
of this paper.


Theorem 2.1 ([8]) With the previous notations, assume that we have a parti-
tion of Q:                    a      a      a
                      Q = Q1     Q2     ...    Qs
such that                              Y          Y         Y
                   fΓ (q, Q) =                                     (q a Qi − Qj )

                                                 Qj ∈Qβ


is a unit of R. Then, Hq,Q
                       r,1,n (R) is Morita-equivalent to the following algebra:
                          M                 1                         s
                                       Hq,Q                     q,Q
                                        r1 ,1,n1 (R) ⊗ . . . ⊗ Hrs ,1,ns (R)
                       n1 ,...,ns >0
                      n1 +...+ns =n



where for i ∈ [1, s], ri = |Qi |.


2.B     Clifford theory
Let y1 , y2 ,...,yd and v be indeterminates over C. For i ∈ [1, d], put

                                                xi := yip

and for i ∈ [1, r], i = sp + t with s ∈ [0, d − 1], t ∈ [1, p], ηp := exp( 2iπ
                                                                            p ),

                                         Qi := ηpt−1 ys+1 .

Form the sequences x := (x1 , . . . , xd ) and Q := (Q1 , . . . , Qr ).



                                                   3
    Let A := C[x1 , x−1                  −1
                       1 , . . . , xd , xd , v, v

fractions.
    Let θ : A → C be a ring homomorphism such that C is the field of fractions
of θ(A).
We put for i ∈ [1, d],
                                         xi := θ(xi ),
for i ∈ [1, r],
                                        Qi := θ(Qi )
and
                                         v := θ(v).
   Note that for i ∈ [1, r], i = sp + t with s ∈ [0, d − 1], t ∈ [1, p], then
                                                            p
Qi := ηpt−1 ys+1 , for a complex number ys+1 such that ys+1     = xs+1 .
We also form the sequences x := (x1 , . . . , xd ) and Q := (Q1 , . . . , Qr ).
                                                                      v,Q
   We will note for short H, resp. H, for the Ariki-Koike algebras Hr,1,n   (K),

resp. Hr,1,n (C) and H , resp. H , for the cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,p,n (K),
resp. Hv,x
       r,p,n (C).


   Since H, resp. H, is graded over H′ , resp. H ′ , we will give some results
which comes from Clifford theory.

    Let H be the Ariki-Koike algebra H, resp. H, and H′ be the cyclotomic
Hecke algebra H′ , resp. H ′ . In both cases, we will denote by Res the functor
of restriction from the category of the H-modules to the category of the H′ -
modules and by Ind the functor H ⊗H′ − from the category of the H′ -modules
to the category of the H-modules.

    Let V be a H-simple module and U be a simple submodule of Res V . Put
                                                         fk

where f := fHH′ and for i ∈ [0, of,V − 1], f V is the H-module with the same
underlying space as V and the structure of module is given by composing the
original action of H with f i .
In the same way, let
                                                         gk

underlying space as U with the action of H twisted by g i .

                                                          i=0

(see [6, Theorem 11.1]). Using [14, Proposition 2.2], we get
                                                        of,V −1

                                                         i=0

as well as
                            p
                                  = [Res V : U ][Ind U : V ].                     (5)
                        of,V og,U
As Res V is g-stable, [6, Proposition 11.14] implies that EndH (Ind Res V ) is
graded over EndH′ (Res V ) by a cyclic group of order p. By (4) and (5), the di-
                                        p2
mension of EndH (Ind Res V ) over C is of,V and by the grading over EndH′ (Res V ),
                                        2
this dimension is equal to p[Res V : U ] og,U . By comparison with (5), it follows
that
                           [Res V : U ] = [Ind U : V ].                         (6)
Now, by definition of of,V , for short o, there exists an H-automorphism
                                                    o
                                    t : V → f V.
     p                                                                p
So, t o is an H-isomorphism. By Schur’s lemma, t o is a scalar. There exists a
                                  p
complex number c such that ( ct ) o = IdV . Then
                                      p
                                    o −1
                                    M           t
                          Res V ≃           Ker( − ηpoi IdV ).
                                      i=0
                                                c

It is easy to see that for each i ∈ [0, po − 1], Ker( ct − ηpoi IdV ) is an H′ -module
                 i
isomorphic to g Ker( ct − IdV ). So the semi-simple module Res V decomposes
into more than op simple modules and by (5) by less than op simple modules.
Therefore Res V decomposes into exactly po simple modules and [Ind U : V ] = 1
so [Res V : U ] = 1 by (6).
As the module induced from a simple H′ -module to H is semi-simple, the asser-
tions of the Lemma are proved.

2.C     The semi-simple case
We keep the notations of the previous subsection.
                                                                  v,Q
   We study the representation theory of the algebras H := Hr,1,n     (K) and
        v,x
H′ := Hr,p,n (K). By [1, Main Theorem], H is a split semi-simple algebra. This
implies that H′ is also split semi-simple.

    A complete set of non isomorphic modules for H has been given in [4] and [7].
Let Πrn be the set of r-partitions of n. We say that λ = λ(i) i∈[1,r] is a r-
partition of size n if for every i, λ(i) is a partition and Σri=1 |λ(i)| = n.
For each r-partition λ ∈ Πrn , we can associate an Hv,Q    r,1,n (A)-module S
                                                                              v,Q
                                                                                  (λ)
called a “Specht module” that is free over A. Here, we use the definition of
“classical” Specht module contrary to [7] where the dual Specht modules are
defined. We have the following theorem.


Theorem 2.3 ([4],[7]) The following set is a complete set of non isomorphic
absolutely irreducible Hv,Q
                        r,1,n (K)-modules:
                     n                                     o
                        v,Q
                       SK   (λ) := K ⊗A S v,Q (λ) | λ ∈ Πrn .




   For each λ ∈ Πrn , the set of standard tableaux of shape λ is a basis of the
                               v,Q
underlying C-vector space of SK    (λ) (see [4]). Using [4, Propositions 3.16, 3.17]
and some combinatorial properties, it is easy to get the


Proposition 2.4 Let λ ∈ Πrn . The map

                         hv,Q       v,Q
                              : fH′SK          v,Q     
                          λ             (λ) → SK   ̟(λ)                             (7)

that sends a standard λ-tableau T = (Ti )i∈[1,r] to the standard ̟(λ)-tableau
̟(T) := (T̟−1 (i) )i∈[1,r] is an H-isomorphism where ̟ is the permutation of Sr
defined by Q̟(i) := ηp Qi , for all i ∈ [1, r] and ̟(λ) = (λ(̟−1 (1)), . . . , λ(̟−1 (r))).


   Define
                         oλ := min {k ∈ N>0 | ̟k (λ) = λ}.
It is clear that oλ = of,S v,Q (λ) and

                      SK   (λ, i) := Ker(hoλλ − ηpoλ i IdS v,Q (λ) ).               (8)

   Let L be a set of representatives of r-partitions for the action of the cyclic
group generated by ̟ over Πrn . It follows from Lemma 2.2, the


Proposition 2.5 The set
                             v,Q                         p

                                                        oλ
is a complete set of non isomorphic simple H′ -modules.


    If T is a standard λ-tableau, then for j ∈ [0, opλ − 1], the element
                                             p
                                            oλ   −1

                                             i=0

belongs to the eigenspace        Ker(hoλλ   − ηpoλ j IdS v,Q (λ) ). It comes from the fact that
                                                           K
             p
            oλ   −1
       oλ    X
T =                (T, j), that for every j ∈ [0, opλ − 1], the eigenspace Ker(hoλλ −
        p    j=0
ηpoλ j IdS v,Q (λ) ) is generated by the (T, j), T a standard λ-tableau. So we have
          K
just described the simple H′ -modules, see also [2].

   The following part is now concerned with the non semi-simple case: simple
Hq,Q                     q,x
 r,1,n (C)-modules and Hr,p,n (C)-modules.




2.D       The non semi-simple case
We keep the notations of §2.B.


2.D.1       Decomposition maps
The aim of this part is to define the decomposition maps for H := Hq,Q                       r,1,n (C)
                                                            −1                 −1
and H ′ := Hq,x     r,p,n (C).  Recall that  A  := C[x 1 , x1  , . . . , xd , xd  , v, v −1
                                                                                            ],  K :=
C(x1 , . . . , xd , v) and that θ : A → C is a ring homomorphism.
    Using [10], there exists a discrete valuation ring O with maximal ideal I(O)
such that A ⊂ O and I(O) ∩ A = ker(θ). Let k0 := O/I(O) be the residue
field of O. Denote by : O → k0 the canonical map. We obtain the algebras
  q,Q                   q,x
Hr,1,n (k0 ) and Hr,p,n      (k0 ). The field k0 can be considered as an extension of C
that is the quotient field of θ(A). By [12, Lemma 7.3.4], there is an isomor-
phism between the Grothendieck groups of finitely generated H-modules and
  q,Q
Hr,1,n (k0 )-modules (resp. H ′ -modules and Hq,x     r,p,n (k0 )-modules):

            R0 (H) ≃ R0 (Hq,Q
                          r,1,n (k0 ))           and           R0 (H ′ ) ≃ R0 (Hq,x
                                                                                r,p,n (k0 )).

As a consequence, we obtain well-defined decomposition maps by choosing O-
forms for the simple Hq,Q                         q,x
                      r,1,n (K)-modules (resp. Hr,p,n (K)-modules) and reducing
them modulo I(O):
                             dr,1,n : R0 (H) → R0 (H),

                                                   7
                                dr,p,n : R0 (H′ ) → R0 (H ′ ).
     For a simple H-module V and W a simple H′ -module, there exist non neg-
                 (1)                                  (p)
ative integers dV,M with M a simple H-module and dW,N with N a simple
H ′ -module such that:
                                                 (1)
                                            X
                            dr,1,n ([V ]) =     dV,M [M ]
                                                      M∈Irr(H)
                                                                      (p)
                                                         X
                                   r,p,n
                       and       d         ([W ]) =                  dW,N [N ].

    By using the same argument as in [11, Lemma 5.2] (see also [12, Theorem
7.4.3.c]), we obtain the following result.

Proposition 2.6 The following diagram commutes:

    In the following, we will see that under some additionnal hypotheses, the
above property leads to some interesting results about the decomposition map
of cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type G(r, p, n) and about the simple H ′ -modules.


2.D.2    Simple modules of non semi-simple Ariki-Koike algebras
We will work under the following hypothesis. We assume that v is a primitive
root of unity,
                                              2iπ
                               v := ηe = exp(     ),
                                               e
for a positive integer e > 1. Let
                             f := gcd(e, p), e = f e′ , p = f p′ ,
             ′     ′
then ηf = ηpp = ηee .
By the definition of Q and Theorem 2.1, without lost of generality, we can
suppose that there exist integers v1 ≤ . . . ≤ vδ that belong to [0, e′ − 1] such
that Q consists of the complex numbers ηevi ηpj , where i ranges over [1, δ] and j
ranges over [0, p − 1]. Then r = δf p′ and we can split Q into p′ sets:
                                      a a ′
                             Q = Q1      ...    Qp ,


                                                 8
                                           ′
with Qj formed by the ηevi ηplp +j , i ∈ [1, δ] and l ∈ [0, f − 1]. We consider Qj as
an ordered sequence
                                                                         ′                ′
                      Qj = (ηpj−1 ηev1 , . . . , ηpj−1 ηevδ , ηpp +j−1 ηev1 , . . . , ηpp +j−1 ηevδ , . . .
                                                   ′                             ′
                                   ηp(f −1)p +j−1 ηev1 , . . . , ηp(f −1)p +j−1 ηevδ ).                         (9)


Remark : First note that, for j ∈ [1, p′ ], Qj = ηpj−1 Q1 and
                                           ′                     ′                    ′                  ′
     Q1 = (ηev1 , . . . , ηevδ , ηev1 +e , . . . , ηevδ +e , . . . , ηev1 +(f −1)e , . . . , ηevδ +(f −1)e ),

with v1 ≤ . . . ≤ vδ ≤ v1 + e′ ≤ . . . ≤ vδ + (f − 1)e′ .
    Note also that the quotient of two elements that belong to Qj , for j ∈ [1, p′ ],
is a power of v = ηe while the quotient of an element of Qj by an element of Ql ,
l ∈ [1, p′ ], l 6= j is not such a power, by definition of f .

   If we order the elements of Q by the ordered elements of Q1 , then the
ordered elements of Q2 , etc, Theorem 2.1 implies that the Ariki-Koike algebra
H is Morita equivalent to the algebra
                              M                        1                         p′
                                           Hq,Q                     q,Q
                                            f δ,1,n1 (C) ⊗ . . . ⊗ Hf δ,1,np′ (C).
                          n1 ,...,n ′ ≥0
                                   p
                         n1 +...+n ′ =n
                                    p


So it is clear that H is also Morita equivalent to the algebra
                                    1
                                                        q,Q1

                               Hq,Q
                                f δ,1,n1 (C) ⊗ . . . ⊗ Hf δ,1,np′ (C).
                         n1 ,...,n ′ ≥0
                                  p
                        n1 +...+n ′ =n
                                   p



We order Q and we split it into p′ sets following what we have done for Q:
                                     a a ′
                            Q = Q1       ...   Qp .




2.D.3      Parametrization of simple H-modules
We can now give a parametrization for the simple H-modules. By [3, Theo-
rem 2.5], the simple modules of the Ariki-Koike algebra Hq,Q 1                  ′
                                                         f δ,1,ni (C), i ∈ [1, p ],
                                               1                     1                1
are the quotient modules DCv,Q (λ) := SCv,Q (λ)/J(SCv,Q (λ)) of the specialisa-
                                                       1                     1
tions of the Specht modules SCv,Q (λ) := C ⊗ S v,Q (λ) by their radical of Ja-
cobson, with λ a Kleshchev f δ-partition (for the parameters Q1 ) of size ni . So
the simple modules of H are labelled by the p′ -tuples of Kleshchev f δ-partitions
                                         p′
                                 p′

(associated to Q ) (λ , . . . , λ ) with    |λi | = n. We will denote this set by Λ0
                                                           i=1
and for λ ∈ Λ0 , DCv,Q (λ) the corresponding simple H-module.

    In [20], another parametrization for the simple Hq,Q      1
                                                          f δ,1,ni (C)-modules has been
found by using Lusztig’s a-function (see Theorem 2.7 below). Following this
paper, we will associate to each r-partition an a-value. To do this, we first
describe the a-value of a f δ-partition µ = (µ(1), µ(2), ..., µ(f δ)).
    For k = 1, ..., δ, s = 1, ..., f and j = (s − 1)δ + k we put wj := vk + (s − 1)e′
so that wj is the power of the j th -component of Q1 .
    Then, for j := 1, ..., f δ, we define:
                                                            je
                                        m(j) := wj −           +e
                                                            fδ
and for s = 1, ..., n, we put:

                                 Bs′(j) := µ(j)s − s + n + m(j)

where we use the convention that µ(j)p := 0 if p is greater than the height of
                                           ′(j)     ′(j)
µ(j). For j = 1, ..., f δ, let B ′(j) = (B1 , ..., Bn ). Then, we define:
       (1)
                          X                          X
      af δ (µ) :=                     min {a, b} −       min {k, m(j) } + g(n).
                          0≤i≤j<f δ                         1≤i,j≤f δ
                      (a,b)∈B ′(i) ×B ′(j)                   a∈B ′(i)
                          a>b if i=j                         1≤k≤a



where g(n) is a rational number which only depends on the m(j) and on n (the
expression of g is given in [20]).
                                                                         ′
    Let λ ∈ Πrn , write λ = (λ(1), . . . , λ(r)) as λ = (λ1 , . . . , λp ) where, for
i ∈ [1, p′ ], λi = λ(f δ(i − 1) + 1), . . . , λ(f δ(i − 1) + f δ) .
    Finally, we define

Theorem 2.7 ([19, Theorem 2.3.8]) Let λ be a Kleshchev f δ-partition of

    Recall what is a FLOTW f δ-partition λ = λ(1), . . . , λ(f δ) of size n′ associ-
ated to the parameters v and Q1 , see [9]. Denote each partition λ(i), i ∈ [1, f δ],
as (λ(i)1 , λ(i)2 , . . .). The multipartition λ satisfies
  1. for i ∈ [1, f ], j ∈ [1, δ − 1], k positive integer,

      as well as
  4. to each node of the diagram of λ which is located in the ath row and the
     bth column of the cth partition of λ (for two poditive integers a and b and
     1 ≤ c ≤ f δ), we associate its residue ηeb−a+vc . Then, for any positive
     integer k, the cardinality of the set of the residues associated to the nodes
     in both the k th columns and the right rims of the Young diagrams of λ is
     not e.

2.D.4    Preliminary results
In order to prove the main Theorem, we will need some preliminary results.

the ordered elements of Q2 etc as in §2.D.2. Let ̟ be the permutation of Sr

                                                                     ′            ′
           λ := (λ1 [1], ..., λ1 [f δ], λ2 [1], ..., λ2 [f δ], ..., λp [1], ..., λp [f δ])
be an r-partition. Hence, following the notations of the previous paragraph, we
have λj [i] = λ(f δ(j − 1) + i). Then, it is easy to verify that

                                                11
    • for i ∈ [1, (p′ − 1)f δ], then ̟(i) = i + f δ,
    • for i ∈ [r − f δ + 1, r − δ], then ̟(i) = i − r + (f + 1)δ,
    • for i ∈ [r − δ + 1, r], then ̟(i) = i − r + δ.
Then, by Proposition 2.4, we have:

where ̟(λ) = (λp [f δ − δ + 1] , . . . , λp [f δ],λp [1] , . . . , λp [f δ − δ], λ1 [1] , . . . ,

        0        (1) v,Q        (1) f H′ v,Q
if λ ∈ Λ , then ar (DC (λ)) = ar ( H DC (λ)).


    Proof : By the definition of the a-value (see §2.D.3), we have:
                                                  ′
                                             p
                                                           (1)

                          a(1)
                           r (SK (λ))   :=                af δ (λi [1], ..., λi [f δ])
                                             i=1

                                                                                         (1)   ′
Thus, by using the above properties, it is sufficient to show that af δ (λp [1] , . . .
    ′          (1)   ′                        ′                  ′              ′
, λp [f δ])= af δ (λp [f δ − δ + 1], . . . , λp [f δ], λp [1], . . . , λp [f δ − δ]).
     Using the notations of §2.D.3, for i = 1, ..., δ and j = 1, ..., f we write
m(i) [j] := m((j−1)δ+i) . Then, all we have to do is to prove that m(i) [j] doesn’t
                                              ((j − 1)δ + i)e                         ie
depend on j. We have m(i) [j] = vi −                              + (j − 1)e′ = vi − because
                                                     fδ                               f
e′ f = e. Hence, we obtain the desired result.

  With the definition (10), it is trivial that the previous result about Specht
                                        (1)              (1) H
modules implies that, for any λ ∈ Λ0 , ar (DCv,Q (λ)) = ar (fH ′DCv,Q (λ)).

    With Proposition 2.8 and Lemma 2.2, we can associate an a-value to each
                                                           v,Q
simple H′ -module U . If U appears in the restriction Res SK   (λ), for λ ∈ Πrn ,
put
                                           v,Q
                          a(p)        (1)
                                                   
                           r (U ) := ar   SK   (λ) .



    In the same way, we can associate an a-value to each simple H ′ -module W .
If W appears in the restriction Res DCv,Q (λ), for λ ∈ Λ0 , then
                                                v,Q
                                a(p)        (1)
                                 r (W ) := ar (DC (λ)).




    Another useful proposition is the following one.




                                                  12
Proposition 2.9 Let λ ∈ Λ1 , then ̟(λ) ∈ Λ1 , where ̟ is defined in the
Proposition 2.4.

                                                            ′
       Proof : Write λ ∈ Λ1 as λ = (λ1 , . . . , λp ) where λi = (λi [1], . . . , λi [f δ]) is a
FLOTW f δ-partition for Q1 . We will see that ̟(λ) ∈ Λ1 so the result will be
                                                                 ′                            ′      ′
proved. The r-partition ̟(λ) is equals to (λp [f δ − δ + 1] , . . . , λp [f δ],λp [1]
            ′                                              ′                   ′
, . . . , λp [f δ − δ], λ1 [1] , . . . , λ1 [f δ], . . . λp −1 [1] , . . . , λp −1 [f δ]). It belongs to
                             ′                               ′            ′               ′
Λ1 if and only if (λp [f δ − δ + 1] , . . . , λp [f δ], λp [1] , . . . , λp [f δ − δ]) is a
FLOTW f δ-partition. It is easy to verify that the three first conditions hold.
Now, the set of the residues associated to the nodes in both the k th columns and
the right rims of the Young diagrams of this last multipartition consists of the
                   ′                               ′
residues of λp but multiplied by ηee . So the fourth condition about FLOTW
multipartitions hold as well as the Proposition.



3      A parametrization of the simple H ′ -modules
We keep the above notations. The aim of this section is to describe a parametriza-
tion of the simple H ′ -modules, with H ′ = Hv,Q
                                             r,p,n (C). The proof is highly inspired
by [14, Theorem 2.1].


Theorem 3.1 For all simple H ′ -module N , there exists a simple H′ -module
WN such that
                                       X
             dr,p,n ([WN ]) = [N ] +             dWN ,L [L],

                                                   ar (L)<ar (N )

       (p)                (p)
and ar (N ) = ar (WN ).
       ′                                       ′                   v,Q
Let Λ1 := {WN | N ∈ Irr(H ′ )}. Then Λ1 consists in the SK             (λ, i), with
     1              p
λ ∈ Λ ∩ L, i ∈ [0, oλ − 1] with the notations of the Proposition 2.5 and the map
                                    ′                           ′
N ∈ Irr(H ′ ) 7→ WN ∈ Λ1 is bijective. So Λ1 is a parametrization of the simple
H ′ -modules.


   Proof : Fix a simple H ′ -module N . By Lemma 2.2, there exists λ ∈ Λ0 such
that N appears in the restriction ResDCv,Q (λ). We have
                                                                           (1)

                                                         C
                                                                        (11)

tion 2.6, this equality implies that
                                                                 p

where N ′ is a sum of H ′ -modules, D, with a-value ar (D) < ar (DCv,Q (λ)) and,

for all i, j, ar (SCv,Q (κ(λ), i)) = ar ((gH ′ ) N ).
                                                                            H
Denote by τ (λ) ∈ Λ0 , the multipartition defined by DCv,Q (τ (λ)) := fH ′DCv,Q (λ).
                                   H
If we twist the action of H by fH ′ , the equality (11) gives that κ(τ (λ)) = ̟(κ(λ))
by Proposition 2.9 and by definition of κ. As this map is bijective, it is clear
that
                            of H ,S v,Q (κ(λ)) = of H ,Dv,Q (λ)

Recall that for i ∈ [0, oκ(λ) − 1], SK   (κ(λ), i) is conjugate to SK   (κ(λ), 0) by
  H i                                                                    p
(gH′ ) . The equality (12) implies that there exists an unique i ∈ [0,
                                                                       oκ(λ) − 1]
such that
                      dr,p,n ([SCv,Q (κ(λ), i)]) = [N ] + [N ′′ ],           (13)

where N ′′ is a sum of H ′ -modules, D, with a-value ar (D) < ar (N ). This
construction makes clear all the statements of the Theorem.

Remark : The above theorem is only concerns with the case where v is a primitive
eth -root of unity. If v isn’t a root of unity, it is readily checked that an analogue
of this theorem holds by replacing Λ1 by the set of Kleshchev multipartitions Λ0
at e = ∞. The proof of this result can be easily obtained following the outline
of [14].
