                                                    Introdution.

                                                        1. Let A, B , C be Hermitian n × n matries with given eigenvalues, τ (A) =
                                                    {λ1 (A) ≥ λ2 (A) ≥ . . . ≥ λn (A)}, τ (B) = {λ1 (B) ≥ λ2 (B) ≥ . . . ≥ λn (B)}, τ (C) =
                                                    {λ1 (C) ≥ λ2 (C) ≥ . . . ≥ λn (C)}. The well-known lassial problem about spetrum
                                                    of a sum of two Hermitian matries (Horn's problem) is to desribe a onnetion
                                                    between τ (A), τ (B), τ (C) for matries A, B , C suh that A + B = C .
                                                        A reent solution of this problem (see. [3, 4℄ and others) gives a omplete de-
                                                    sription of possible τ (A), τ (B), τ (C) in terms of linear inequalities of the form
                                                                              X             X            X
                                                                                   λi (A) +     λj (B) ≥      λk (C),                    (0.1)
                                                                              i∈I         j∈J           k∈K

                                                    where I, J, K are ertain subsets of {1, . . . , n}. Note that the number of neessary
                                                    inequalities inreases with n.
                                                    2. Consider the following modifiations of the problem mentioned above, alled hene-
                                                    forth the spetral problem (res. strit spetral problem). We will onsider bounded
                                                    linear Hermitian operators on a separable Hilbert spae H . For an operator X denote

                                                                                                1
by σ(X) its spetrum. Let M1 , M2 , M3 be given losed subsets of R+ and γ ∈ R+ . The
problem onsists of the following: 1)to determine whether there are Hermitian oper-
ators A, B, C on H suh that σ(A) ⊆ M1 , σ(B) ⊆ M2 , σ(C) ⊆ M3 (res. σ(A) = M1 ,
σ(B) = M2 , σ(C) = M3 ) and A + B + C = γI ? 2) if the answer is in the affirmative,
to give a desription (up to unitary equivalene) of the operators. In this work the
sets M1 , M2 , M3 will be finite. Note that even for finite Mk the seond part of the
problem an be very ompliated if |Mk | is large enough.
    The essential differene with the lassial Horn's problem is that we do not fix
the dimension of H (it may be finite or infinite) and the spetral multipliities. It
seems that solution of spetral and strit spetral problems ould not be dedued
diretly from inequalities of the form (0.1), sine the number of neessary inequalities
inreases with n.
3. These problems ould be reformulated in terms of *-representations of *-algebras.
Namely, let α = (α1 , α2 , . . . , αk ), β = (β1 , β2 , . . . , βl ), δ = (δ1 , δ2 , . . . , δm ) be vetors
with positive stritly dereasing oeffiients. Let us remark that we an assume that
eah set M1 , M2 , M3 ontains zero (this an be ahieved by a translation). Heneforth,
M1 = α ∪ {0}, M2 = β ∪ {0}, M3 = δ ∪ {0}. Let us onsider the assoiative algebra
defined by the following generators and relations (see. [7℄):
                    Pα,β,δ,γ = Chp1 , p2 , . . . , pk , q1 , q2 , . . . , ql , s1 , s2 , . . . , sm |
                                pi pj = δij pi , qi qj = δij qi ; si sj = δij si ;
                                k
                                X                l
                                                 X               m
                                                                 X
                                       αi pi +         βj qj +         δd sd = γei.
                                 i=1             j=1             d=1

Here e is the identity of the algebra, δij is the Kroneker symbol. This is a ∗-algebra,
if we delare all generators to be self-adjoint.
    A ∗-representation π of Pα,β,δ,γ is determined by a triple of non-negative operators
       Pk                     Pl                  Pm
A =       i=1 αi Pi , B =       j=1 βj Qj , C =       d=1 δd Sd , where eah of the families of
                              Pk                                              Pl
orthoprojetions, {I − i=1 PP        i , Pi = π(pi ), i = 1, . . . , k}, {I −  j=1 Qj , and Qj =
                                        m
π(qj ), j = 1, . . . , l} and {I − d=1 Sd , Sd = π(sd ), d = 1, . . . , m}, forms a resolution
of the identity and suh that A + B + C = γI . So in terms of ∗-representations, the
spetral problem is a problem onsisting of the following two parts: 1) a desription
of the set Σk,l,m of the parameters α, β , δ, γ for whih there exist ∗-representations
of Pα,β,δ,γ ; 2) a desription of *-representations π of the *-algebra Pα,β,δ,γ . A natural
way to try to solve the spetral problem is to desribe all irreduible ∗-representations
up to unitary equivalene and then all *-representations as sums or diret integrals
of irreduible representations.
    An essential step in this diretion is to desribe of irreduible non-degenerate rep-
resentations. Let us introdue non-degenerate representations and then reformulate
the strit spetral problem in terms of *-representations of algebras. Let us all a
∗-representation π of the algebra Pα,β,δ,γ non-degenerate, if π(pi ) 6= 0, π(qj ) 6= 0,
                                                              P                  P
π(sd ) 6= 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ j ≤ l, 1 ≤ d ≤ m, and ki=1 π(pi ) 6= I , lj=1 π(qj ) 6= I ,
Pm
   d=1 π(sd ) 6= I . Consider the following sets: Tk,l,m = {(α, β, δ, γ)|α ∈ R , β ∈
                                                                                          +k

R , δ ∈ R , γ ∈ R } and W = {(α, β, δ, γ) ∈ Tk,l,m| there is a non-degenerate
  +l          +m            +

*-representation of Pα,β,δ,γ }; they depend only on (k, l, m). With an integer vetor



                                                           2
(k, l, m) we will assoiate non-oriented star-shape graph G with three branhes of
the lengths k , l and m stemming from single root. Heneforth we will denote W by
W (G), and Tk,l,m by T (G), where G is the tree mentioned above. We will need some
more notations Wirr = {(α, β, δ, γ) ∈ T (G)| there exists a non-degenerate irreduible
*-representation of Pα,β,δ,γ }. The strit spetral problem for operators on a Hilbert

spae an be reformulated in the following way: 1) for a given graph G desribe the set
W (G); 2) desribe non-degenerate representations Pα,β,δ,γ up to unitary equivalene.
4. A ommon part of the spetral and strit spetral problems is a desription of the
set Wirr (G) and irreduible representations. The present artile is devoted to this
ommon part for Dynkin graphs.
    If the graph is a Dynkin graph, the problem is greatly simplified. The algebras
Pα,β,δ,γ assoiated with Dynkin graphs (res. extended Dynkin graphs) have a more
simple struture then in other ases. In partiular, the algebras Pα,β,δ,γ are finite
dimensional, (res. have polynomial growth) if and only if the assoiated graph is a
Dynkin graph (res. an extended Dynkin graph) (see. [8℄). As shown in [6℄ irreduible
representations of the algebras assoiated with Dynkin graphs exist only in ertain
dimensions that are bounded from above. In the paper we give a omplete desription
of W (G)irr for all Dynkin graphs G and an algorithm for finding all irreduible
representations.
    In Se. 1 and Se. 2 we will show that the theory of ∗-representations of the
algebras assoiated with suh graphs an be reformulated in terms of loally-salar
graph representations.
    In Se. 3 we summarize the alulation of possible parameters and generalized di-
mensions of non-degenerate irreduible ∗-representations of the ∗-algebras assoiated
with Dynkin graphs using the mahinery elaborated in [6℄.
    Sine the desription of ∗-representations of the ∗-algebras assoiated with Dynkin
graphs an be redued to a desription of non-degenerate irreduible representations
(see [9℄), in this artile we essentially solve the spetral problem for the algebras
assoiated with Dynkin graphs.
    The results of the paper were partially announed in [5℄.
    Let us remark that representations of quivers were also studied in onnetion with
Horn's problem in [2℄.

resentations of the algebras generated by ortho-

Heneforth we will use definitions, notations and results about representations of
graphs in ategory of Hilbert spaes found in [6℄. Let us reall some of them.
    A graph G onsists of a set of verties Gv a set of edges Ge and a map ε from
Ge into the set of one- and two-element subsets of Gv (the edge is mapped into the
set of inident verties). Heneforth we onsider onneted finite graphs without
                                                                  ◦     •

to Gv and the other to Gv . Verties in Gv will be alled even, and those in the
    •
set Gv odd. Let us reall the definition of a representation Π of a graph G in the
ategory of Hilbert spaes H. Let us assoiate with eah vertex g ∈ Gv a Hilbert
spae Π(g) = Hg ∈ ObH, and with eah edge γ ∈ Ge suh that ε(γ) = {g1 , g2 } a
pair of mutually adjoint operators Π(γ) = {Γg1 ,g2 , Γg2 ,g1 }, where Γg1 ,g2 : Hg2 → Hg1 .
Construt a ategory Rep(G, H), its objets are representations of the graph G in H.

   Let Mg be the set of verties onneted with g by an edge. Let us define the
operators                            X
                               Ag =      Γgg′ Γg′ g .

    A representation Π in Rep(G, H) will be alled loally-salar, if all operators Ag
are salar, Ag = αg IHg . The full subategory Rep(G, H), objets of whih are loally-
salar representations, will be denoted by Rep G and alled the ategory of loally-
salar representations of the graph G.
    Let us denote by VG the real vetor spae onsisting of sets x = (xg ) of real
numbers xg , g ∈ Gv . Elements x of VG we will all G-vetors. A vetor x = (xg )
is alled positive, x > 0, if x 6= 0 and xg ≥ 0 for all g ∈ Gv . Denote VG+ = {x ∈
VG |x > 0}. If Π is a finite dimensional representation of the graph G then the G-
vetor (d(g)), where d(g) = dim Π(g) is alled the dimension of Π. If Ag = f (g)IHg
then the G-vetor f = (f (g)) is alled a harater of a loally-salar representation
Π and Π is alled an f -representation in this ase. The support GΠ    v of Π is {g ∈
Gv |Π(g) 6= 0}. A representation Π is faithful if GΠ
                                                   v = Gv . A harater  of the loally-
salar representation Π is uniquely defined on the support Gv and non-uniquely on
                                                               Π

its omplement. In the general ase, denote by {fΠ } the set of haraters of Π. For
eah vertex g ∈ Gv , denote by σg the linear operator on VG given by the formulae:
                                  (σg x)g′ = xg′ if g′ 6= g,
                                                    X
                                (σg x)g = −xg +           xg ′ .

The mapping σg is alled a refletion at the vertex g . The omposition of all refletions

Definition 1     An irreduible finite dimensional *-representation         π of the algebra
Pα,β,δ,γ suh that π(pi ) 6= 0(1 ≤ i ≤ k), π(qj ) 6= 0(1 ≤ j ≤ l), π(sd ) 6= 0(1 ≤ d ≤ m),
     Pk                  Pl                Pm
and     i=1 π(pi ) 6= I,  j=1 π(qj ) 6= I,  d=1 π(sd ) 6= I , will be alled non-degenerate.
By RepPα,β,δ,γ we will denote the full subategory of non-degenerate representations
in the ategory RepPα,β,δ,γ of ∗-representations of the ∗-algebra Pα,β,δ,γ in the ate-

gory H of Hilbert spaes.


    Let π be a ∗-representation of Pα,β,δ,γ on a Hilbert spae H0 . Put Pi = π(pi ),
1 ≤ i ≤ k, Qj = π(qj ), 1 ≤ j ≤ l, St = π(st ), 1 ≤ t ≤ m. Let Hpi = ℑm Pi ,
Hqj = ℑm Qj , Hst = ℑm St . Denote by Γpi , Γqj , Γst the orresponding natural
isometries Hpi → H0 , Hqj → H0 , Hst → H0 . Then, in partiular, Γ∗pi Γpi = IHpi is
the identity operator on Hpi and Γpi Γ∗pi = Pi . Similar equalities hold for the operators
Γqi and Γsi . Using π we onstrut a loally-salar representation Π of the graph G.
    Let Γij : Hj → Hi denote the operator adjoint to Γji : Hi → Hj , i.e. Γij = Γ∗ji .
Put

                                      Π(g0 ) = H g0 = H0 ,

    In these equalities the summands are omitted from the left and the right in turns.
Analogously, we define subspaes Π(gi ) for i = k+1, . . . , k+l and i = k+l+1, . . . , k+
l + m. Define the operators Γg0 ,gi : H gi → H g0 , where i ∈ {k, k + l, k + l + m}, by

                        Γg0 ,gk+l+m =    δ1 Γs1 | δ2 Γs2 | . . . | δm Γsm .


Now we define the representation Π on the edges γg0 ,gk , γg0 ,gk+l , γg0 ,gk+l+m by the
rule

                                   Π(γg0 ,gk ) = {Γg0 ,gk , Γgk ,g0 },
                                Π(γg0 ,gk+l ) = {Γg0 ,gk+l , Γgk+l ,g0 },
                           Π(γg0 ,gk+l+m ) = {Γg0 ,gk+l+m , Γgk+l+m,g0 }.

               Γg0 ,gk Γgk ,g0 + Γg0 ,gk+l Γgk+l ,g0 + Γg0 ,gk+l+m Γgk+l+m,g0 = γIH g0 .

Analogously one an onstrut the operators C (gi ) for i ∈ {k + l, . . . , k + l + m}. It is
routine to hek that the operators {C (gi ) }0≤i≤k+l+m intertwine the representations
                 e = Φ(e                            (gi )
Π = Φ(π) and Π           π ). Put Φ(C0 ) = {C0≤i≤k+l+m        }. Thus we have defined
a funtor Φ : RepPα,β,δ,γ → RepG, see [5℄. Moreover, the funtor Φ is univalent
               g
and full. Let Rep(G,  d, f ) be the full subategory of irreduible representations of
                       g
Rep(G, d, f ). Π ∈ Ob Rep(G,    d, f ), f (gi ) = xi ∈ R+ , d(gi ) = di ∈ N0 , where f is
the harater of Π, d its dimension. It easy to verify that the representation Π is
isomorphi (unitary equivalent) to an irreduible representation from the image of
the funtor Φ if and only if

An irreduible representation Π of the graph G satisfying onditions (2.2)(2.5) will

The vetor n = (n0 , n1 , . . . , nk+l+m) is alled a generalized dimension of the repre-

of the algebra Pα,β,δ,γ , d = (d0 , d1 , . . . , dk+l+m ) be the dimension of Π. It is easy to
see that

                               n2 + . . . + nk−1 + nk = dk−1 ,

                                              ...
Thus

   Denote by RepG the full subategory in Rep G of non-degenerate loally-salar
representations of the graph G. As a orollary of the previous arguments we obtain
the following theorem.
Theorem 1      Let Pα,β,δ,γ be assoiated with a graph G. The funtor Φ is an equiva-
lene of the ategories RepPα,β,δ,γ of non-degenerate *-representations of the algebra

Pα,β,δ,γ and the ategory RepG of non-degenerate loally-salar representations of the
graph G.

   Let us define the Coxeter funtors for the ∗-algebras Pα,β,δ,γ , by putting Ψ =

representation of the *-algebra Pα,β,δ,γ .

    Obviously, all irreduible representations of the *-algebra assoiated with the
Dynkin diagram An are one-dimensional, with diagram Dn one- or two-dimensional
and only the algebras assoiated with the diagrams D4 , E6 , E7 , E8 have non-degenerate
irreduible representations.
    In the next setion we will do the following: we know how to onstrut all ir-
reduible loally-salar representations of Dynkin graphs with the aid of Coxeter
refletion funtors starting from the simplest ones. In partiular, we an find their
dimensions and haraters [6℄. Next we single out non-generate representations and
apply the equivalene funtor Φ, see Theorem 1.

   Using the proof of theorem 3.9 (see [6℄) and diret alulations we see that all non-

          ◦         •
funtors F and F in 4 and 5 steps from the simplest one Πg0 that orresponds to the
simple root g 0 of the graph E6 . The dimension of the representation Πg0 is denoted by
dg0 (g). Then dg0 (gi ) = 0 if gi 6= g0 , dg0 (g0 ) = 1. Let the harater of Πg0 is denoted
by fg0 , then fg0 (g0 ) = 0, fg0 (gi ) = ti > 0 if gi 6= g0 . All irreduible loally-salar
representations of Dynkin diagrams are obtained from the simple representations
with haraters of suh type by using the Coxeter refletion funtors (see [6℄). In the
subsequent alulations we will write the harater value below or to the right and
the dimension over or to the left of the vertex.

    Thus Π = F 4 (Πg0 ) is a non-degenerate representation of the graph G with di-

    Conditions (3.1) imposed on f (gi ) are neessary and suffiient for a representation
of the algebra Pα,β,δ,γ in the dimension Φ(d) to exist. Computing the harater we
       ◦(4)

                  γ > α1 , γ > β1 , α2 + β1 > γ, α1 + β2 > γ, γ > α2 + β2
and the identity 3γ = δ + α1 + α2 + β1 + β2 . Knowing the dimension d we find the or-

Theorem 3         The algebra   Pα,β,δ,γ   assoiated with       D4 has an irreduible non-degenerate

we obtain a non-degenerate representation of dimension ck (dg0 ). Analogously, in k

of dimension ck (dg6 ), where dg6 (g6 ) = 1 and dg6 (gi ) = 0, if gi 6= g6 .

In eah of the above ases the representation is unique up to unitary equivalene.


Remark. Inequalities in Theorem 2 5 an be obtained alternatively using Horn's

inequalities (see, for example [3℄) and W. Crawley-Boevey solution of the Deligne-
Simpson problem (see [1℄). More preisely, representations of Pα,β,δ,γ (not neessarily
∗-preserving) in a fixed generalized dimension d = (n; . . .) are in one-to-one orrespon-
dene with n × n matries A1 , A2 , A3 piked from fixed diagonal onjugay lasses
C1 , C2 , C3 . These lasses are determined by (α, β, γ, δ) and d. Thus an appliation
of [1, Theorem 1℄ to diagonal onjugay lasses gives a desription of the parameters
(α, β, γ, δ) for whih there is an irreduible (not neessarily ∗-preserving) representa-
tion of algebra Pα,β,δ,γ in terms of the root system of a ertain Ka-Moody Lie algebra.
In partiular, it follows that there are only finitely many suh representations in the
ase of a Dynkin graph and generalized dimensions d are some simple roots (up to
a ertain linear transformation ([1, Theorem 1℄). Moreover, for a fixed generalized
dimension d suh a representation π is unique. If we require that the parameters
of the algebra satisfy Horn's inequalities (we must translate the parameters α, β, γ, δ
and the generalized dimension d into eigenvalues and their multipliities first) then π
must be unitarizable and thus (α, β, γ, δ) ∈ Wirr . Thus ombining Horn's inequalities
and Crawley-Boevey onditions of irreduibility for d we obtain inequalities in Theo-
rem 2- 5. However, to derive our results we do not use neither Horn's inequalities nor
Crawley-Boevey onditions. Moreover, we give an algorithm, the Coxeter funtors
for ∗-representations, to onstrut ∗-representations of Pα,β,δ,γ .
