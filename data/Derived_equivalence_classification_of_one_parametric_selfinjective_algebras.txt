                                            0. Introduction and the main result.

                                               Throughout the paper K will denote a ﬁxed algebraically closed ﬁeld. By an algebra we
                                            mean a ﬁnite dimensional K-algebra (associative, with an identity), which we shall assume
                                            (without loss of generality) to be basic and connected. An algebra A can be written as a
                                            bound quiver algebra A ∼  = KQ/I, where Q = QA is the Gabriel quiver of A and I is an
                                            admissible ideal in the path algebra KQ of Q. An algebra A is called selﬁnjective if the
                                            projective A-modules are injective.
                                               From Drozd’s Tame and Wild Theorem [14] the class of algebras may be divided into
                                            two disjoint classes. One class consists of the tame algebras for which the indecomposable

modules occur, in each dimension d, in a ﬁnite number of discrete and a ﬁnite number of
one-parametric families. The second class is formed by the wild algebras whose represen-
tation theory comprises the representation theories of all ﬁnite dimensional K-algebras.
Accordingly we may realistically hope to classify the indecomposable ﬁnite dimensional
modules only for the tame algebras. A special class of tame algebras is formed by the
algebras of ﬁnite representation type having only ﬁnitely many isomorphism classes of in-
decomposable ﬁnite dimensional modules. The representation theory of algebras of ﬁnite
representation type is presently well understood, and in particular the Morita equivalence
classes of all selﬁnjective algebras of ﬁnite representation type are classiﬁed (see [12],[22],
[30], [31], [37]). The representation theory of arbitrary tame algebras is still only emerging.
    For an algebra A, we denote by mod A the category of ﬁnite dimensional left A-modules
and by mod A its stable category. Recall that the objects of mod A are the objects of
mod A without nonzero projective direct summands, and for any two objects M and
N in mod A the K-module HomA (M, N) of morphisms from M to N is the quotient
HomA (M, N) /P (M, N), where P (M, N) is the submodule of HomA (M, N) consisting of
all A-homomorphisms which factorize through a projective A-module. Moreover, we denote
by D b (mod A) the derived category of bounded complexes of modules from mod A [20].
Two algebras A and B are said to be stably equivalent if the stable module categories mod A
and mod B are equivalent. Finally, two algebras A and B are said to be derived equiva-
lent if the derived categories D b (mod A) and D b (mod B) are equivalent as triangulated
categories. Since Happel’s work [19] interpreting tilting theory in terms of equivalences of
derived categories, the machinery of derived categories has been of interest to representa-
tion theorists. In [28] J. Rickard proved his celebrated criterion: two algebras A and B are
derived equivalent if and only if B is the endomorphism algebra of a tilting complex over
A. Since a lot of interesting properties are preserved by derived equivalences of algebras, it
is for many purposes important to classify classes of algebras up to derived equivalence, in-
stead of Morita equivalence. For instance, for selﬁnjective algebras the representation type
is an invariant of the derived category. In fact, derived equivalent selﬁnjective algebras are
stably equivalent [29], and for any algebra a stable equivalence preserves the representation
type [24], [25]. Finally, we note that derived equivalent algebras have the same number of
pairwise nonisomorphic simple modules. The derived equivalence classiﬁcation has been
established for some distinguished classes of tame selﬁnjective algebras (see [2], [6], [7],
[21], [23], [27], [29] for some work in this direction).
    We are concerned with the problem of the derived equivalence classiﬁcation of one-
parametric selﬁnjective algebras. Recall that an algebra A of inﬁnite representation type
is called one-parametric if there exists a A-K [x]-bimodule M which is ﬁnitely generated
and free as right K [x]-module and, for any dimension d, all but a ﬁnite number of iso-
morphism classes of indecomposable (left) A-modules of dimensional d are of the form
M ⊗ K [x] / (x − λ)m for some λ ∈ K and some m > 1. We also mention that the class
of one-parametric algebras coincides with the class of algebras having exactly one generic
module [13]. By general theory, the class of one-parametric selﬁnjective algebras splits
into two classes: the standard algebras, having simply connected Galois coverings, and the
remaining nonstandard algebras. It is expected that the nonstandard one-parametric (even
                Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras         3


the representation-inﬁnite domestic) selﬁnjective algebras occur only in characteristic 2 and
are geometric and socle deformations of standard one-parametric selﬁnjective algebras.
    By general theory [35], [26], the class of standard one-parametric selﬁnjective algebras
                                                               b
coincides with the class of selﬁnjective algebras of the form B/G,   where Bb is the repetitive
                                                              A    D
algebra of a tilted algebra B of Euclidean type e m or e n , and G is an inﬁnite cyclic group
generated by an automorphism ϕ of B      b whose square ϕ2 is a twist ρν b of the Nakayama
                                                                          B
automorphism νBb by a rigid automorphism ρ of B.   b We also note that the stable Auslander-
Reiten quiver of a standard one-parametric
                               n          o    selﬁnjective algebra consists of one Euclidean

component ∆ of type ∆ ∈          e m,

                                            and a 1 (K)-family of stable tubes. In [9], [10],
[11] we classiﬁed the Morita equivalence classes of all standard one-parametric selﬁnjective
algebras by algebras arising from Brauer graphs. Moreover, the derived (respectively,
stable) equivalence normal forms of all standard one-parametric weakly symmetric algebras
has been established in our paper [7]. Recall that a selﬁnjective algebra A is called weakly
symmetric if the socle soc P of any indecomposable projective A-module P is isomorphic
to its top P/ rad P .
    The main aim of the paper is to establish the derived (respectively, stable) equivalence
normal forms of all standard one-parametric algebras which are not weakly symmetric,
using the Morita equivalence classiﬁcation of this class of algebras established in [11]. For
θ ∈ K\ {0}, we associate to a Brauer graph Tp,q,k of the form

we associate a standard one-parametric selﬁnjective algebra Γ∗ (n) of Euclidean type e n .D
See Section 1 below for the precise deﬁnitions.
   The following theorem is the main result of the paper.

Theorem 1. For a standard selfinjective algebra A the following statements are equiva-
lent:
     (1) A is one-parametric but not weakly symmetric.
     (2) A is derived equivalent to an algebra of the form Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) or Γ∗ (n).
     (3) A is stably equivalent to an algebra of the form Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) or Γ∗ (n).

We note that the algebras Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Γ∗ (n) are never stably equivalent, because
their stable Auslander-Reiten quivers are not isomorphic (see Propositions 7.1 and 7.2).
Moreover, by Proposition 7.1, the algebras Γ∗ (m) and Γ∗ (n) are stably equivalent only
for m = n. Finally, we refer to Proposition 10.1 for a necessity criterion for the stable
equivalence of algebras of the form Λ (p, q, k, s, θ).
    As an application of Theorem 1 and results of our earlier papers [7] and [8] we obtain the
following description of Auslander’s representation dimension repdim (A) and Rouquier’s
dimension dim mod A of the triangulated category mod A (see Section 8 for the relevant
deﬁnitions) of arbitrary standard one-parametric selﬁnjective algebras A.

Theorem 2. Let A be a standard one-parametric selfinjective algebra. Then repdim (A) =
3 and dim mod A = 1.

    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we recall the Morita equivalence clas-
siﬁcation of all standard one-parametric selﬁnjective but not weakly symmetric algebras.
Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 are devoted to the proof of the implication (1) =⇒ (2) of Theorem 1
                       A
in the Euclidean case e m , and Section 6 to the proof of this implication in the Euclidean
     D
case e n . In Section 7 we describe the stable Auslander-Reiten quivers of algebras occur-
ring in Theorem 1. Section 8 is devoted to a class of weakly symmetric algebras needed
in the proof of implication (3) =⇒ (1) of Theorem 1. In Section 9 we complete the proof
of Theorem 1. In Section 10 we discuss the stable equivalence of algebras occurring in
Theorem 1. The ﬁnal Section 11 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 2.

for background on selﬁnjective algebras to [15], [39].

1. One-parametric nonweakly symmetric selfinjective algebras

     We describe in this section the Morita equivalence classiﬁcation of all standard one-
parametric but not weakly symmetric selﬁnjective algebras established in [11].
     A Brauer graph T is a ﬁnite connected undirected graph, where for each vertex there is
a ﬁxed circular order on the edges adjacent to it (see [1], [23], [27], [33]). In our context we
assume that T has at most one cycle (which may be or may not be a loop). We draw T in
a plane and agree that the edges adjacent to a given vertex are clockwise ordered. Given
a Brauer graph T , this deﬁnes a Brauer quiver QT as follows. The vertices of QT are the
edges of T and there is an arrow i −→ j in QT if and only if j is the direct successor of
i in the order around some vertex (to which i and j are both adjacent). We require that
every vertex of QT belongs to exactly two cycles. Note that this implicitly means that, for
every end vertex of T , there is a loop in QT .
     Let T be a Brauer graph with exactly one cycle Rk , having k > 2 edges. Let
v1 , v2 , . . . , vk be the vertices of Rk and ei = {vi , vi+1 } , i = 1, 2, . . . , k, where vk+1 = v1 ,
the edges of Rk . If v is a vertex of the Brauer graph T which is not a vertex of the cycle
Rk then by n(v) we denote the edge incident to v on the unique walk in T from v to the
cycle Rk . Moreover, for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, we denote by n(vi ) the edge ei . For a vertex v of
the graph T , we denote by l (Rk , v) the distance of v to the cycle Rk . Hence l (Rk , v) = 0
if and only if v belongs to Rk . By an automorphism of the Brauer graph T we mean an
automorphism of the graph T which preserves the ﬁxed circular order on the edges adja-
cent to any vertex. A rotation of the Brauer graph T is an automorphism σ of the Brauer
graph T such that, for some integer s with 1 6 s 6 k − 1, we have σ(vi ) = vi+s for all
i = 1, 2, . . . k (where k + r = r for r > 1), and then we set σ = σs . For k = 2, we set
σ1 (e1 ) = e2 and σ1 (e2 ) = e1 .
     Assume that s is a positive integer such that 1 6 s 6 k − 1 and gcd(s + 2, k)=1. We
shall deﬁne a generalized Brauer quiver Q (T, σs ), obtained from the usual Brauer quiver
QT of the Brauer graph T by shifting some arrows of QT using the rotation σs of T . By a
σs -orbit of a vertex v of T we mean the orbit of v with respect to the action of the cyclic
group generated by σs on the vertices of T . We note that if two vertices v and w of T
belong to the same σs -orbit then l (Rk , v) = l (Rk , w). Moreover, all σs -orbits of vertices
of T have the same number of elements, namely k/d, where d = gcd (s, k). For m > 0,
denote by Vm the set of all vertices of T with l (Rk , v) = m. Observe that Vm is a disjoint
union of d|Vkm | σs -orbits.
     In order to deﬁne the generalized Brauer quiver Q (T, σs ), we introduce an order p (T, σs )
                                                               P
of the edges of the Brauer graph T , as the union of ∞                 d|Vm |
                                                                   m=0 k      cyclic orders p (T, σs , v)
deﬁned for the representatives v of all pairwise diﬀerent σs -orbits of vertices of T . Let
v be a vertex of T . We deﬁne the cyclic order p (T, σs , v) by invoking the cyclic or-
                                                          k/d−1
ders of edges around the vertices v, σs (v) , . . . , σs         (v) in the Brauer graph T . Let
r ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k/d − 1}, let i be an edge of T adjacent to the vertex σsr (v), and let j be
the direct successor of i in the cyclic order in T around σsr (v). If j 6= n (σsr (v)), then j is
deﬁned to be the direct successor of i in the cyclic order p (T, σs , v). If j = n (σsr (v))
6                                R. Bocian, T. Holm and A. Skowroński


then n (σsr+1 (v)) = σs (n (σsr (v))) is said to be the direct successor of i in the cyclic
order p (T, σs , v). Therefore, we replaced the cyclic orders around the vertices σsr (v),
0 6 r 6 k/d − 1, by one (bigger) cyclic order p (T, σs , v). Observe also that if e = {v, w}
is an edge of T which is not on the cycle Rk , or if e is on the cycle Rk and d > 1, then
e belongs to exactly two cyclic orders, namely p (T, σs , v) and p (T, σs , w). On the other
hand, if e = {v, w} is an edge of the cycle Rk and d = 1, then e occurs twice in the cyclic
order p (T, σs , v) = p (T, σs , w).
      We deﬁne the generalized Brauer quiver Q (T, σs ) as follows. The vertices of Q (T, σs )
are the edges of T and there is an arrow i −→ j in Q (T, σs ) if and only if j is the direct
successor of i in the order p (T, σs ).
      For θ ∈ K\ {0}, we deﬁne the algebra Ω(1) (T, σs , θ) as the bound quiver algebra
                (1)
KQ(T, σs )/I (T, σs , θ), where KQ(T, σs ) is the path algebra of the quiver Q(T, σs ) and
  (1)
I (T, σs , θ) is the ideal in KQ(T, σs ) generated by the elements:
       (1) αβ where α = i1 −→ i2 , β = i2 −→ i3 and i1 , i2 , i3 are not consecutive elements in
the cyclic order p (T, σs ).
       (2) C(i, p (T, σs , v))−C(i, p (T, σs , w)), for i 6= e1 and C(e1 , p (T, σs , v))−θC(e1 , p (T, σs , w)),
where i = {v, w} is an edge of T , C(i, p (T, σs , v)) and C(i, p (T, σs , w)) are the paths from
i to σs (i) in the quiver Q(T, σs ), corresponding to the consecutive elements i, . . . , σs (i) of
the cyclic orders p (T, σs , v) and p (T, σs , w), respectively.
If T = Tp,q,k is of the form (⋆) and gcd (s, k) = 1, then we denote Ω(1) (T, σs , θ) by
Λ (p, q, k, s, θ).

    Let T be a Brauer tree. Then the simple cycles of the Brauer quiver QT may be divided
into two camps, α-camps and β-camps, in such a way that any two cycles which intersect
nontrivially belong to diﬀerent camps. We denote by αi (respectively, βi ) the arrow of
the α-camp (respectively, β-camp) of QT starting at a vertex i, and by α (i) (respectively,
β (i)) the end vertex of αi (respectively, βi ). We also denote by Ai (respectively, Bi ) the
cycle from i to i going once around the α-cycle (respectively, β-cycle) through i.
    Let T be a Brauer tree with two (diﬀerent) distinguished vertices v1 and v2 such that
v1 is the end of exactly one edge a. Let the edge b be the direct successor of the edge a and
let c be the direct predecessor of the edge a in the cyclic order of edges at the end vertex
u of a diﬀerent from v1 . The vertices v1 , v2 and edges b, c determine a subtree

    The following theorem is the main result of [11].

Theorem 1.3. Let A be a basic connected standard selfinjective algebra. Then A is one-
parametric but not weakly symmetric if and only if A is isomorphic to one of the algebras
of the forms Ω(1) (T, σs , θ) or Ω(2) (T, v1 , v2 ).

     For dealing with the algebras Ω(1) (T, σs , θ), the following deﬁnitions will be convenient
in the sequel. Let i be an edge in T . We deﬁne the level of i to be the distance of i from
the cycle of T . In particular, the edges of level 0 are precisely the edges on the cycle of T .
For any edge i of level r > 2 we denote by n (i) the unique edge of level r−1 adjacent to i.
At each vertex v1 , . . . , vk on the cycle of T there are two Brauer trees attached, an inner
one and an outer one. For u = 1, . . . , k, we denote these Brauer trees by Tuinn and Tuout ,
respectively, with Tuinn ∩ Tuout = {vu }. Recall that we denote the edges of the cycle of T by
eu , for 1 ≤ u ≤ k, where eu has adjacent vertices vu and vu+1 .
     The following result completely describes the Cartan matrices of the algebras Ω(1) (T, σs , θ).
We state it for the convenience of the reader since it might be useful to recall it when we are
dealing with tilting complexes later. The result follows directly from the deﬁning relations
as listed in the deﬁnition above. Therefore the details of the proof are left to the reader.

Proposition 1.4. Given the algebra Ω(1) (T, σs , θ), and edges i of level r and j of level t
of the Brauer graph T , the following holds for the Cartan entries dim Hom (P (i) , P (j)).

     (1) If |r−t| > 2, then dim Hom (P (i) , P (j)) = 0.
     (2) Let |r−t| = 1.
       (a) For t = r−1, the following holds.
           • Let r > 2. Then dim Hom (P (i) , P (j)) = 0, unless j = σ (n (i)), in which
     case Hom (P (i) , P (j)) is one-dimensional.

          • Let r = 1 and i ∈ Tuout for some 1 6 u 6 k. Then dim Hom (P (i) , P (j)) = 0,
     unless j = σ (eu ) or j = σ (eu−1 ), in which case Hom (P (i) , P (j)) is one-dimensional.
          • Let r = 1 and i ∈ Tuinn for some 1 6 u 6 k. Then
                                     
                                      2 if s = k−1 and j = eu−1
            dim Hom(P (i), P (j)) =       1 if s 6= k−1 and (j = eu−1 or j = σ (eu ))
                                     
                                          0 if j 6= eu−1 and j 6= σ (eu )
       (b) For t = r+1, the following holds.
          • Let r > 1. Then dim Hom (P (i) , P (j)) = 0, unless j is an edge adjacent to i,
     in which case Hom (P (i) , P (j)) is one-dimensional.
          • Let r = 0 and i = eu for some 1 6 u 6 k. Then

2. Tilting complexes for Brauer graph algebras with a cycle

    In this section we are going to prove a ﬁrst reduction step towards the derived equiva-
lence classiﬁcation of the algebras Ω(1) (T, σs , θ). We show that, up to derived equivalence,
we can assume the Brauer trees attached to the vertices of the cycle to be stars, i.e., all
edges have level at most 1. The proof will be based on the well-known construction of
derived equivalences for Brauer tree algebras [29]. But of course, the crucial new aspects
are that for the algebras Ω(1) (T, σs , θ) the Brauer graph contains a cycle and that we have
to take the automorphism σs into account.
   We shall need some notation. Let Ω(1) (T, σs , θ) be as deﬁned above, with Brauer graph
T having exactly one cycle of length k, and rotation automorphism σs . For abbreviation,
we usually omit the index and just write σ for σs .
    In a slight abuse of notation we denote the successive edges on the cycle of T just by
1, 2, . . . , k, instead of e1 , . . . , ek . Then the vertex vu of T lying on the cycle has adjacent
edges u−1 and u.
    Recall that the edges of the Brauer graph T correspond to the simple modules of
 (1)
Ω (T, σs , θ). For an edge i we denote the corresponding projective indecomposable mod-
ule by P (i).

    The following notation will be very convenient and will be used frequently throughout
the paper. Let i and j be edges in T . We denote by [i, j] the ’interval’ from i to j in
the order p(T, σ) of edges of T , that is, the set of edges {f | i 6 f 6 j} (which might be
empty). Note that the terminology ’interval’ is slightly misleading since the set [i, j] is not
necessarily linearly ordered. We shall only use this notation as a convenient way of denoting
homomorphisms. In fact, a sequence of consecutive edges between i and j describes a path
in the Brauer quiver; multiplication with any such path gives a homomorphism P (i) →
P (j) between the corresponding projective indecomposable modules, which we also denote
by [i, j] : P (i) → P (j). Whenever we use this notation, it will always be clear from the
context which sequence of edges is meant. As described in detail in Proposition 1.4, many
of the Cartan invariants are 1; in these cases the above notation for homomorphisms is
unambigious.

   Our main result in this section is the following.


Proposition 2.1. Let Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) be as defined above. Then Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) is derived equiv-
alent to Ω(1) (Te, σ, θ) with Brauer graph Te of the following shape

edges attached to the vertices of the cycle.
    The rest of this section will be devoted to a proof of Proposition 2.1.
    Construction of the tilting complex. For each edge i of T we consider the following path
from an edge on the cycle of T to i. If i ∈ Tuout then we take the unique shortest path from
u − 1 to i. If i ∈ Tuinn we take the unique shortest path from u to i. Denote the edges
on this path by i0 , i1 , . . . , il = i. By construction, there is a unique (up to scalar multipli-
cation) homomorphism [ij , ij+1 ] : P (ij ) → P (ij+1 ) between the corresponding projective
indecomposable modules (see Proposition 1.4).
    We then consider the following bounded complex of projective Ω(1) (T, σ, θ)-modules
                                     [i0 ,i1 ]                                   [il−1 ,i]
                Q(i) : 0 → P (i0 ) −→ P (i1 ) → . . . → P (il−1 ) −→ P (i) → 0

in which all maps are non-zero and where P (i0 ) is in degree 0. The entries in degree −r
are corresponding to edges of level r.
    Note that the composition of any two maps is zero by the usual Brauer tree relations
which also hold in Ω(1) (T, σs , θ). For the edges on the cycle of T this construction just
gives stalk complexes concentrated in degree 0.
                                        L
Proposition 2.2. The complex Q := i∈T Q(i) is a tilting complex for Ω(1) (T, σ, θ).

Proof. Exactly as in Rickard’s construction for Brauer tree
                                                          algebras [29] one sees that
add(Q) generates the homotopy category K b Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) as a triangulated category.

   We have to show that in the homotopy category, Hom(Q, Q[n]) = 0 for all n 6= 0.
   By Proposition 1.4 (1), it is clear that Hom(Q, Q[n]) = 0 unless n ∈ {−1, 0, 1}.
   We ﬁrst consider a map α of complexes from Q(i) to Q(j)[−1]. Hence we have a
commutative diagram of the form

   0 → P (i0 ) → P (i1 ) → . . . → P (ir ) → P (ir+1 ) → P (ir+2 ) → . . .
                  ↓ α0                 ↓       ↓ αr          ↓
         0     → P (j0 ) → . . . → P (jr−1) → P (jr ) → P (jr+1 ) → . . .

Let r be minimal such that αr 6= 0. By Proposition 1.4, the composition P (ir ) → P (ir+1 ) →
P (jr ) is non-zero. In fact, if the level r ≥ 1 then this composition is the socle map; if r = 0
then there are two possibilities for j0 , but in both cases the composition is non-zero (recall
that the map P (i0 ) → P (i1 ) is given by multiplication with the shortest path from i0 to i1 ).
This contradicts the fact that α is a map of complexes, which proves Hom(Q, Q[−1]) = 0,
as desired.
   Secondly, we have to consider maps α of complexes from Q(i) to Q(j)[1]. We then have
a commutative diagram of the form

               0
               → P (i0 ) → . . . → P (ir−1 ) → P (ir ) → P (ir+1) → . . .
                  ↓ α0                 ↓        ↓ αr        ↓
   0 → P (j0 ) → P (j1 ) → . . . → P (jr ) → P (jr+1) → P (jr+2 ) → . . .

Let r be maximal with the property αr 6= 0. Moreover, we choose α from its homotopy
class such that this value of r is minimal. Assume ﬁrst that r > 1. The existence of a
non-zero map αr from level r > 1 to level r + 1 implies that jr+1 is adjacent to ir (see
Proposition 1.4 (2b)). But this implies jr = ir , which means that αr factors through P (jr ).
This factorisation gives a homotopy from α to a map β for which the minimal non-zero
map occurs in a degree strictly smaller than for α. This contradicts the choice of α as
being of minimal such degree in its homotopy class.
    Now assume that r = 0. There are four possibilities for a non-zero map from level 0 to
level 1: either j1 is in Tiout
                           0 +1
                                , in Tiinn
                                       0
                                           , in Tiout
                                                  0
                                                             inn
                                                      or in Tσ(i 0 )+1
                                                                       . In the ﬁrst two cases we deduce
that j0 = i0 , in the third case that j0 = i0 − 1, and in the latter case that j0 = σ(i0 ) + 1.
In all cases, α0 factors through P (j0 ), implying that α is homotopic to zero.
    Hence, Hom(Q, Q[1]) = 0 in the homotopy category, as desired.
    This completes the proof that Q is a tilting complex for Ω(1) (T, σ, θ).


    By Rickard’s criterion [28] the endomorphism ring of the tilting complex Q for Ω(1) (T, σ, θ)
is derived equivalent to the algebra Ω(1) (T, σ, θ). So it remains to prove that this endo-
morphism ring has the structure described in Proposition 2.1.

Proposition 2.3. Let Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) be as above, with Brauer trees attached to the vertices
of the cycle denoted by T1out , . . . , Tkout and T1inn , . . . , Tkinn , where Tuout and Tuinn are attached
to the vertex between the edges u − 1 and u on the cycle.

    Let Q = ⊕i∈T Q(i) be the tilting complex for Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) asdefined above. Then the
endomorphism ring of Q is isomorphic to the algebra Ω(1) Te, σ, θ , where the Brauer graph
Te can be described by the following properties.
      (i) The cycle of Te is the same as the cycle of T .
     (ii) All edges of Te have level at most 1.
    (iii) Denote by Euout and Euinn the numbers of edges of the Brauer trees Tuout and Tuinn ,
respectively. In Te, attached to the vertex adjacent to the edges u − 1 and u, we have Eσ(u)+1
                                                                                        out

                    inn
outer edges and Eu−1     inner edges.
    Note that compared with the algebra Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) the inner Brauer trees have been
shifted by one vertex on the cycle, and the outer Brauer trees have been shifted by −(s + 1)
where σ = σs . This means that the order p(Te, σ) on the edges of End(Q) is diﬀerent from
the order of edges of the original algebra Ω(1) (T, σ, θ). But note that the automorphism σ
is the same for both Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) and the endomorphism ring of Q.
    The rest of this section is devoted to a proof of Proposition 2.3. The proof consists of
three steps. We ﬁrst describe morphisms
                                            between direct summands of Q, which correspond
                                 (1) e
to the arrows of the algebra Ω       T , σ, θ . Secondly, we show that these maps satisfy the
                                   
deﬁning relations of Ω(1) Te, σ, θ . In the third step we show that End(Q) is actually
                             
                 (1) e
isomorphic to Ω       T , σ, θ . To this end, we need to show that there are no further
relations in End(Q).
I. The morphisms between summands of Q. The direct summands of the tilting complex
Q are complexes deﬁned completely analogous to Rickard’s construction for the classical
Brauer tree algebras. Recall that for a Brauer tree algebra, the endomorphism ring was
a star; more precisely, the cyclic ordering of the edges for the endomorphism ring can be
obtained by the famous ’walk around the Brauer tree’ (see [18]). Note that in contrast to
the usual Brauer tree setting, in our case one can not walk completely around the Brauer
tree since our algebras are not symmetric. Still, one gets for the endomorphism ring of the
complexes corresponding to any Brauer tree Tuout and Tuinn a cyclic ordering of the edges.
In other words, in End(Q), all edges will have level at most 1.
    Let us now deﬁne explicitly the morphisms between direct summands of Q correspond-
ing to successive edges in the order p(Te, σ).
    (1) The maps inside the Brauer trees.
    Within any of the Brauer trees Teuout and Teuinn of End(Q) these morphisms are given as in
Rickard’s construction by a walk around the Brauer tree. Actually, for our proof we don’t
need to know these maps in detail; for checking relations it will only be important that
their composition in degree 0 is the identity (which is immediate from Rickard’s classical
construction).
    Next, we show that we actually have non-zero sequences of morphisms starting from
                                                               inn
Q(u) through all complexes corresponding to vertices of Tu−1       to Q(u − 1) and further on
                                                        out
through all complexes corresponding to edges of Tσ(u)+1 and ﬁnally to Q(σ(u)).

    (2) The maps Q(u) → Q(Tu−1        ).
    For any edge u on the cycle consider [u, u − 1], that is, the sequence of edges u, con-
secutive edges of level 1 in Tuinn and u − 1. Then multiplication by [u, u − 1] gives a
homomorphism P (u) → P (u − 1).
                           inn
    Then for any f in Tu−1     we have a homomorphism of complexes Q(u) → Q(f ) given by
multiplication with [u, u − 1] in degree 0.
    In fact, this is a map of complexes since Q(f ) starts with a map from P (u − 1) given by
walking around the endpoint of u−1 not adjacent to u. Since the edges are not consecutive
in the order p(T, σ), the composition with [u, u − 1] is zero.

     (4) The maps Q(u − 1) → Q(Tσ(u)+1     ).
     Let qu denote the map P (u − 1) → P (σ(u)) given by multiplication with [u − 1, σ(u)],
i.e., the sequence of edges u, all edges of level 1 in Tuout , and σ(u).
                            out
     Let g be an edge in Tσ(u)+1 . We have a homomorphism of complexes Q(u − 1) → Q(g)
given by multiplication with qu in degree 0.
     In fact, this is a map of complexes since Q(g) starts with a map from P (σ(u)) given by
an edge not consecutive to the last edge of qu in the order p(T, σ).

   (5) The maps Q(Tσ(u)+1  ) → Q(σ(u)).
                          out
   Finally, for any g in Tσ(u)+1 there is an obvious map from Q(g) to the stalk complex
Q(σ(u)) given by the identity in degree 0.
   The composition of the maps just described is the map from Q(u) to Q(σ(u)) given by
the socle map. In particular, this composition is non-zero in End(Q), as desired.
    (6) The maps around the endpoints of Te.
    So far, we have described maps for all consecutive elements in the ordering p(Te, σ)
around the vertices on the cycle. It remains to deﬁne maps corresponding to the endpoints
of the edges of level 1 of the Brauer graph Te. The edges of level 1 in Te correspond to
complexes Q(f ) where f is any edge in T not on the cycle.
    We deﬁne the map Q(f ) → Q(σ(f )) to be multiplication with the socle map [f, σ(f )]
in degree 0 and the zero map in all other degrees.
    We shall show below that this map of complexes is not homotopic to zero, that is, it is
non-zero in End(Q).
   We have thus described maps of complexes corresponding to all consecutive edges in
the order p(Te,σ). In other words, we have given maps corresponding to all arrows in the
quiver of Ω(1) Te, σ, θ .
II. Checking the defining relations.
    We have to show
                      that
                           the maps deﬁned in (1)-(6) above actually satisfy the deﬁning
              (1) e
relations of Ω    T , σ, θ (see Section 1 for the deﬁnition). The Brauer trees attached to
16                               R. Bocian, T. Holm and A. Skowroński


vertices on the cycle of Te are denoted by Teuout = Q(Tuout ) and Teuinn = Q(Tuinn ), respectively.
Hence, attached to the vertex in Te adjacent to u − 1 and u we have Teσ(u)+1out
                                                                                    and Teu−1
                                                                                           inn
                                                                                               .
    (i) Products of non-consecutive edges.
    Let f ∈ Teu+1
              out
                  and g ∈ Teσu+2
                              out
                                  . Then f, u, g are not consecutive in the order of edges of
e
T . We have to show that the corresponding composition of the maps deﬁned above in (5)
and (4) is homotopic to zero. The composition is given in degree 0 by
                                                id   [u,σu+1]
                                   Q(f ) −→ Q(u) −→ Q(g)
and by the zero map in all other degrees. Write Q(f ) : 0 → P (u) → P (i1 ) → . . . and
Q(g) : 0 → P (σ(u) + 1) → P (j1 ) → . . ..
      A suitable homotopy map from Q(f ) to Q(g) is given by [i1 , σ (u) + 1] : P (i1 ) →
P (σ (u) + 1) from degree −1 to degree 0 and the zero maps in all other degrees. In fact, in
degree 0 we clearly get [u, σ (u) + 1], and in degree −1 we indeed get the zero map since
i1 , σ (u) + 1, j1 are not consecutive in the order of edges of T (i1 and j1 are both outer
edges).
      The argument for inner edges works similarly. If f ∈ Teuinn and g ∈ Teu−1   inn
                                                                                      then the
composition Q(f ) → Q(u) → Q(g) is given by [u, u − 1] in degree 0 and the zero maps in
all other degrees. This composition is homotopic to zero via the homotopy map [i1 , u − 1] :
P (i1 ) → P (u − 1) from degree −1 to degree 0, and zero in all other degrees. (Use that
i1 , u, j1 are not consecutive since i1 and j1 are both inner edges.)
      (ii) Socle relations.
      Let f be any edge not on the cycle. The edge in Te corresponding to the complex Q(f )
is of level 1. So there are two maps Q(f ) → Q(σ(f )), given by the orders around the two
endpoints of this edge. Using the deﬁnitions in (1)-(6) above one directly sees that both
compositions are given by the socle map [f, σ(f )] in degree 0 and the zero maps in all other
degrees.
      Now consider an edge u on the cycle, with endpoints v and w. Then by the above
deﬁnitions, the compositions of maps Q(u) → Q(σ(u)) in End(Q) around the two endpoints
are given by multiplication with C(u, p(T, σ, v)) and C(u, p(T, σ, w)) (i.e. by the socle maps
P (u) → P (σ(u))). By deﬁnition of the relations in Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) these maps are equal for
all u 6= 1 and for the distinguished vertex u = 1 they are equal up to multiplication by the
scalar θ. Hence we get exactly the desired relations for Ω(1) (Te, σ, θ).
III. No further relations.
    In the ﬁnal step, we have to prove that there are no further relations in End(Q). To
this end it suﬃces to show that for all edges f the socle map Q(f ) → Q(σ(f )) is not
homotopic to zero, that is, non-zero in End(Q). This is clear for the edges on the cycle,
since the complexes are stalk complexes and the socle map is just the socle map on the
projective indecomposable modules.
    Let f be any edge in Teu+1
                           out
                               for some u. The corresponding complex Q(f ) has the form
                       [u,i1 ]      [i1 ,i2 ]                            [il−1 ,f ]
            0 → P (u) −→ P (i1 ) −→ P (i2 ) −→ . . . −→ P (il−1 ) −→ P (f ) → 0
               Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras            17


where u, i1 , i2 , . . . , il−1 , f is the unique shortest walk in T from the edge u on the cycle to f .
The socle map αf : Q(f ) → Q(σ (f )) is given by the zero map in all non-zero degrees and
                                                            id         [u,u−1]               [u,σu]
in degree 0 it is given by the composition Q(f ) −→ Q(u) −→ Q(u − 1) −→ Q(σ (f )),
that is, by the socle map [u, σ (u)] : P (u) → P (σ (u)). We claim that this map of complexes
Q(f ) → Q(σ (f )) is not homotopic to zero. In fact, assuming there were a homotopy map,
then for degree 0 this map has to be [i1 , σ (u)] : P (i1 ) → P (σ (u)). Since αf is 0 in degree
-1, the homotopy map has to be given by −[i2 , σ (i1 )] : P (i2 ) → P (σ (i1 )). Inductively, the
ﬁnal homotopy map P (f ) → P (il−1) must be given by ±[f, σ (il−1 )]. But then in degree −l
the composition P (f ) → P (σ (il−1 )) → P (σ (f )) is the non-zero socle map, a contradiction,
since αf is zero in degree −l. Hence, αf is not homotopic to zero, as desired.
    A completely analogous argument shows that, for any inner edge g, the socle map
Q(g) → Q(σ (g)) is not homotopic to zero. We leave the details to the reader.
    This completes the proof of Proposition 2.3                                                

3. Moving edges

    In the previous section
                          we    have proved that any algebra Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) is derived equiva-
lent to an algebra Ω(1) Te, σ, θ where all edges in Te are of level at most 1 (i.e., the Brauer
trees attached to the vertices on the cycle are stars).
    In this section we shall prove a further reduction step by showing that, up to derived
equivalence, we can concentrate all edges of level 1 around the vertices of a single σ-orbit.
    There is nothing to prove if the σ-action is already transitive. So in this section we can
assume that the action of σ on the vertices of the cycle is not transitive.
    The main result of this section is the following.
                                           
Proposition 3.1. Let A = Ω(1) Te, σ, θ be as in Proposition 2.1, where all edges are of
level at most 1. Fix any vertex v on the cycle. Then A is derived equivalent to the algebra
Ω(1) T , σ, θ where the Brauer graph T has the following properties:
      (i) The cycle of T is the same as the cycle of Te. All edges of T are of level at most 1.
     (ii) All edges of level 1 are attached to some vertex in the σ-orbit of the fixed vertex v.
     This result will follow immediately from the following two lemmas. The ﬁrst lemma
asserts that, up to derived equivalence, we can move inner edges by one vertex on the
cycle. The analogous second lemma states that outer edges can be moved by −(s + 1)
steps on the cycle, where σ = σs . By applying these two results about moving inner and
outer edges inductively, we can clearly move all edges of level 1 in Te to some vertex in the
σ-orbit of the ﬁxed vertex v.
                                        
Lemma 3.2. Let A = Ω(1) Te, σ, θ be as above with all edges of level at most 1. Fix
any edge u on the cycle, and denote the subsequent inner edges (in the order p(Te, σ)) by
u1 , . . . , uqu , and the inner edges subsequent to u + 1 by (u + 1)1 , . . . , (u + 1)qu+1 . Then
                                                       
A is derived equivalent to an algebra Ω(1) T , σ, θ , where the order p(T , σ) is given as
18                                      R. Bocian, T. Holm and A. Skowroński


follows. For any integer j the order around the common vertex of σ j (u + 1) and σ j (u) is
given by . . . , σ j (u + 1), σ j ((u + 1)1 ), . . . , σ j ((u + 1)qu+1 ), σ j (u1 ), . . . , σ j (uqu ), σ j (u), . . ., and
around the other endpoint of σ j (u) by σ j (u), σ j (u − 1).
    In other words, the inner edges {σ j (u1 ), . . . , σ j (uqu ) | j ∈ Z} can be moved to the next
vertex on the cycle, up to derived equivalence (and all other edges remain unchanged).

Proof. We consider the following bounded complexes of projective A-modules. For any
edge z 6∈ S := {σ j (ui ) | j ∈ Z, 1 6 i 6 qu } let Q(z) be the stalk complex with the
corresponding projective indecomposable module P (z) in degree 0. For the edges in the
σ-orbit of u1 , . . . , uqu we deﬁne the following complexes
                                                                [σj (u),σj (ui )]
                          Q(σ j (ui )) : 0 → P (σ j (u))             −→             P (σ j (ui )) → 0

in degrees 0 and −1.
                                                                              
     Claim: The direct sum Q := ⊕z∈Te Qz is a tilting complex for Ω(1) Te, σ, θ .
    Proof of the claim.
                            From
                                  theconstruction it is clear that add(Q) generates the homo-
topy category K b Ω(1) Te, σ, θ           as triangulated category. It remains to show that, in
the homotopy category, Hom(Q, Q[n]) = 0 for all n 6= 0. This is clear for |n| > 2, since
we are only dealing with two-term complexes. From the relations of A (cf. also Propo-
sition 1.4) we can directly deduce that all non-zero maps P (z) → P (σ j (ui )) with z ∈     / S
                        j
factor through P (σ (u)). Hence, Hom(Q, Q[1]) = 0. Similarly, one sees that any non-zero
map P (σ j (ui )) → P (z) with z ∈    / S remains non-zero when composed with [σ j (u), σ j (ui )].
Hence, Hom(Q, Q[−1]) = 0, which proves the claim.
    The endomorphism ring of Q. By Rickard’s theorem, the endomorphism ring of Q (in
the homotopy category) is derived equivalent to A. So in order to complete the proof we
have to show that End(Q) has the structure described above, where the edges in the σ-orbit
of u1 . . . , uqu are moved by one step to the next vertex on the cycle (and all other edges
remain unchanged). Since ’most’ summands of Q are stalk complexes, it is clear that the
Brauer graph for End(Q) will only change as far as the edges in the σ-orbit of u1 . . . , uqu
are concerned.
    We deﬁne the following maps of complexes between summands of Q involving some
Q(σ j (ui )). For simplicity we describe them for the Q(ui ); the other maps are obtained by
applying σ j . Let Q((u + 1)qu+1 ) → Q(u1 ) be deﬁned by multiplication with [(u + 1)qu+1 , u]
in degree 0. Note that this is indeed a map of complexes since (u + 1)qu+1 , u, u1 are not
consecutive in the ordering of edges of Te. For any i ∈ {1, . . . , qu − 1} we deﬁne a map of
complexes Q(ui ) → Q(ui+1 ) by the identity in degree 0 and [ui , ui+1 ] in degree −1. Finally,
we deﬁne a map Q(uqu ) → Q(u) by the identity in degree 0 and a map Q(u) → Q(u − 1)
by [u, u − 1]. We denote the edges of the Brauer graph for End(Q) corresponding to
Q(σ j (ui )) by σ j (ui ), and the
                                 ’old’ edges corresponding to the stalk complexes as before.
All relations of Ω(1) T , σ, θ not involving     these new complexes immediately follow from
the corresponding same relations in Ω(1) Te, σ, θ . For the other relations, by applying σ j ,
                Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras                             19


it suﬃces to check the relations involving ui . The edges uqu , u, u − 1 are claimed not to
be consecutive in the order of End(Q). In fact, the corresponding map Q(uqu ) → P (u) →
P (u − 1) is given by [u, u − 1] in degree 0. It is homotopic to zero via the homotopy map
[uqu , u−1], giving the desired zero relation in End(Q). Since the maps Q(ui ) → Q(ui+1 ), for
i ∈ {1, . . . , qu −1}, are in degree 0 just the identity, all relations starting at any of the edges
(u + 1)j still hold in End(Q) with the new order of edges. Moreover, the composition of
the socle map Q(σ −1 ((u + 1)qu+1 )) → Q((u + 1)qu+1 ) with the map Q((u + 1)qu+1 ) → Q(u1 )
is zero, since the latter is given by [(u + 1)qu+1 , u].
    It remains to show that the socle relations hold for the edges in End(Q) corresponding
to the complexes Q(σ j (ui )). Again, for simplicity we only consider ui = Q(ui ). Note that
the new order of edges on End(Q) is claimed to have the following consecutive edges:

     ui , . . . , uqu , [u, σ(u + 1)], σ((u + 1)1 ), . . . , σ((u + 1)qu+1 ), σ(u1), . . . , σ(ui−1), σ(ui ).

The corresponding composition Q(ui ) → Q(σ(ui )) is given by the socle map P (u) →
P (σ(u)) in degree 0 and the zero map in degree −1. We      claim that this composition is
not homotopic to zero. In fact, by the relations of Ω(1) Te, σ, θ , this socle map is given
by the order around one of the endpoints of the edge u. So in degree 0 it could only be
factored by the homotopy map [ui , σ(u)], but then in degree −1 this gives the non-zero
socle map P (ui ) → P (σ(ui )), which proves the claim. Note that if we compose this socle
map Q(ui ) → Q(σ(ui )) with the next map Q(σ(ui )) → Q(σ(ui+1 )), then this composition
becomes homotopic to zero via the homotopy map [ui , σ(u)].
    Note that for the socle relation on P (e1 ), where e1 is the distinguished vertex on the
cycle, involving the scalar θ , the corresponding relation on Q(e1 ) in End(Q) involves the
same scalar θ. In fact, the above deﬁned maps on the Q(ui )’s are the identity in degree 0,
so nothing changes for the stalk complexes.
    This completes the proof of the lemma

     There is the following analogous result for moving outer edges. Since the proof is very
similar to the proof of Lemma 3.2 we leave the details to the reader.
                                        
Lemma 3.3. Let A = Ω(1) Te, σ, θ be as above with all edges of level at most 1. Fix any
edge u on the cycle, and denote the outer edges succeeding u − 1 (in the order p(Te, σ)) by
u1 , . . . , upu , and the outer edges succeeding u − 2 by (u − 1)1 , . . . , (u − 1)pu−1 . Then A is
derived equivalent to an algebra Ω(1) T , σ, θ where the order p(T , σ) of edges is given as
follows. For any integer j the order around the common vertex of σ j (u − 2) and σ j (u − 1)
is given by

 . . . , σ j (u − 2), σ j ((u − 1)1 ), . . . , σ j ((u − 1)pu−1 ), σ j+1 (u1 ), . . . , σ j+1 (upu ), σ j+1(u − 1), . . .

and around the other endpoint of σ j (u − 1) by . . . , σ j (u − 1), σ j+1(u), . . ..
   In other words, all outer edges in the σ-orbit of u1 , . . . , upu have been shifted by −(s + 1)
vertices on the cycle (and all other edges remain unchanged).                                    

4. Reduction to the transitive case

    In the last two sections   we proved that any algebra Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) is derived equivalent
to an algebra Ω(1) T , σ, θ where all edges of the Brauer graph T are of level at most 1,
and all edges of level 1 are attached to vertices in a single σ-orbit.
    The main aim of this section is to prove that, up to derived equivalence,      we can even
                                                                      (1)
assume that the σ-action is transitive. If the σ-action on Ω              T , σ, θ is not already
transitive then we will have vertices on the cycle of T with no edges of level 1 attached.
Derived equivalences for this situation are provided by the following result. The crucial
aspect of this result is that if the σ-action is not transitive, then one can reduce the number
of edges on the cycle.
    Recall that the edge e1 on the cycle plays a special role in that the socle relation involves
the scalar θ. The results in the preceding section allow us to concentrate the edges in the σ-
orbit of any vertex on the cycle. So for our purposes we can assume that the distinguished
edge e1 := 1 has no edges attached to it, i.e. the technical assumption in the following
result can always be guaranteed in our context.
                                            
Proposition 4.1. Let A = Ω(1) T , σ, θ be as above, with all edges of T of level at most
1. Assume that for some edge u on the cycle there are no edges of level 1 attached to the
vertices between u − 1 and u and between u and u + 1 (that is, in the ordering of edges we
have that u, u − 1, σ(u) are consecutive and u + 1, u, σ(u + 1) are consecutive). Moreover,
assume that u − 1 and u + 1 are not in the σ-orbit of the distinguished edge.
    Then A is derived equivalent to an algebra Ω(1) (T ∗ , σ ∗ , θ) where all edges of T ∗ are of
level at most 1, and where all edges in the σ-orbit of u − 1 become inner edges of level 1
and all edges in the σ-orbit of u + 1 become outer edges of level 1 in T ∗ .
    In particular, the number of edges on the cycle of T can be reduced, up to derived
equivalence. The automorphism σ ∗ is again given by f 7→ σ(f ) for all edges f . But since
the number of edges decreases, the rotation parameter changes.

Proof. We consider the following two-term complex of projective A-modules. For any
edge z 6∈ {σ j (u) | j ∈ Z} we let Q(z) : 0 → P (z) → 0 be the stalk complex in degree
0. By assumption, for any j ∈ Z, there are no edges between σ j (u) and σ j (u − 1) and
between σ j (u) and σ j (u + 1). Hence, every map from P (z) to P (σ j (u)) factors through
P (σ j−1(u − 1)) or P (σ j (u + 1)). Thus we are led to deﬁne the complexes
             Q(σ j (u)) : 0 → P (σ j−1(u − 1)) ⊕ P (σ j (u + 1)) → P (σ j (u)) → 0,
in degrees 0 and −1. Then the direct sum Q := ⊕z∈T Qz is a tilting complex for A. We
leave the straightforward veriﬁcation to the reader.
    We use the same notation as before for edges in the Brauer graph T of A. We denote by
(u − 1)1 , . . . , (u − 1)qu−1 the inner edges and by (u − 1)1 , . . . , (u − 1)pu−1 the outer edges
between u − 1 and u − 2, respectively. Moreover, let (u + 2)1 , . . . , (u + 2)qu+2 be the inner
edges and (u + 2)1 , . . . , (u + 2)pu+2 the outer edges between u + 1 and u + 2, respectively.
Note that any of the cases qu−1 = 0, pu−1 = 0, qu+2 = 0 or pu+2 = 0 is allowed.
               Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras            21


    We have to determine the endomorphism ring of Q in the homotopy category K b (A)
(it is derived equivalent to A by Rickard’s theorem). For describing the Brauer graph
of the endomorphism ring End(Q), we denote the ’new’ two-term complexes by σ          ej (u) :=
     j
Q(σ (u)). The edges corresponding to the stalk complexes are denoted as before.
    We claim that End(Q) is of the form Ω(1) (T ∗ , σ ∗ , θ) where the Brauer graph T ∗ is
given as follows. Note that the Brauer graph will only change around the new complexes
Q(σ j (u)) (since the others are stalk complexes). It suﬃces to describe the structure around
one of the new complexes, say σ   e(u).
    Claim: The ordering p(T , σ ∗ ) of edges around the one endpoint of σ

                                                                           e(u) is given by

                                           u − 2, (u − 1)1 , . . . , (u − 1)pu−1 , σ
                                                                                   e2 (u), . . .
where σe0 (u−3) occurs exactly if u−3 is contained in the σ-orbit of u. In this case, σ
                                                                                      e0 (u−3)
is on the cycle of T ∗ ; otherwise, u − 2 is on the cycle.
    The order p(T ∗ , σ ∗ ) around the other endpoint of σ
                                                         e(u) is given by

                    e(u), σ(u + 1), σ((u + 2)1 ), . . . , σ((u + 2)pu+2 ), (e
                ...,σ                                                       σ 3 (u + 3)),

                            σ 2 (u + 2), σ 2 ((u + 2)1 ), . . . , σ 2 ((u + 2)qu+2 ), σ
                                                                                      e2 (u), . . .
where σe3 (u + 3) occurs precisely if u − 3 is in the σ-orbit of u. In this case, σ        e3 (u + 3) is
on the cycle of T ∗ ; otherwise σ 2 (u + 2) is on the cycle.
    The adjacent edges on the cycle of T ∗ are . . . , σ
                                                       e0 (u − 3), σ     e2 (u + 3), . . . if u − 3 is in
                                                                   e(u), σ
the σ-orbit of u; otherwise the edges on the cycle are given by . . . , u − 2, σe(u), σ(u + 2), . . ..
    Note that the crucial aspect of this description is that the edges σ j (u −1) and σ j (u + 1),
which were on the cycle in T , become inner and outer edges of level 1 in the Brauer graph
for End(Q). In particular, the cycle for End(Q) has fewer edges than the one for A.
    Proof of the claim. We have to deﬁne maps of complexes between summands of Q
corresponding to the consecutive edges as given in the claim.
    We deﬁne a map Q(σ(u)) → Q(u − 1) by the projection onto P (u − 1) in degree 0.
    The maps between the following stalk complexes are deﬁned by [u − 1, (u − 1)1 ] : Q(u −
1) → Q ((u − 1)1 ), and, for i = 1, . . . , qu−1 − 1 by [(u − 1)i , (u − 1)i+1 ] : Q((u − 1)i ) →
Q((u − 1)i+1 ).
    Moreover, there is the map [(u − 1)qu−1 , u − 2] : Q((u − 1)qu−1 ) → Q(u − 2). If u − 3 is
contained in the σ-orbit of u then this map factors through the complex

                 Q(u − 3) : 0 → P (σ −1 (u − 4)) ⊕ P (u − 2) → P (u − 3) → 0

(indeed a map of complexes since (u − 1)qu−1 , u − 2, u − 3 are not consecutive edges). This
factorization then makes u − 2 an edge of level 1 in T ∗ . Otherwise, u − 2 is on the cycle of
T ∗ , between Q((u − 1)qu−1 ) and Q((u − 1)1 ).
     The maps [(u − 1)i , (u − 1)i+1 ] : Q((u − 1)i ) → Q((u − 1)i+1 ) are as before for A.
22                                R. Bocian, T. Holm and A. Skowroński


    Finally, we have a map Q((u − 1)pu−1 ) → Q(σ 2 (u)) given by ([(u − 1)pu−1 , σ(u − 1)], 0)
in degree 0. Note that this indeed is a map of complexes since (u − 1)pu−1 , σ(u) − 1, σ 2 (u)
are not consecutive edges.
    Next, we consider the edges around the other endpoint of the edge σ         e(u) = Q(σ(u)).
    Let the map Q(σ(u)) → Q(σ(u + 1)) be deﬁned by the projection onto P (σ(u + 1))
in degree 0. Moreover, we deﬁne the following maps between stalk complexes. We set
[σ(u + 1), σ((u + 2)1 )] : Q(σ(u + 1)) → Q(σ((u + 2)1 )) and, for all i = 1, . . . , pu+2 − 1, we
set [σ((u + 2)i ), σ((u + 2)i+1 )] : Q(σ((u + 2)i )) → Q(σ((u + 2)i+1 )). As in A, there is a
map [σ((u + 2)pu+2 ), σ 2 (u + 2)] : Q(σ((u + 2)pu+2 ) → Q(σ 2 (u + 2)).
    If u − 3 is in the σ-orbit of u, then also σ 3 (u + 3) is in the σ-orbit of u. Then the above
map [σ((u + 2)pu+2 ), σ 2 (u + 2)] factors through (the ﬁrst summand of) the complex

           Q(σ 3 (u + 3)) : 0 → P (σ 2 (u + 2)) ⊕ P (σ 3(u + 4)) → P (σ 3(u + 3)) → 0.

Note that this indeed gives a map of complexes since σ((u + 2)pu+2 ), σ 2 (u + 2), σ 3 (u + 3)
are not consecutive edges. In this case, Q(σ 2 (u + 3)) is the next edge on the cycle adjacent
to Q(σ(u)). Otherwise, σ(u + 2) is the next edge on the cycle.
    The maps between the successive inner edges come from stalk complexes and are given
exactly as in A, that is, we consider [σ 2 (u + 2), σ 2 ((u + 2)1 )], and, for i = 1, . . . , qu+2 − 1,
we have [σ 2 ((u + 2)i ), σ 2 ((u + 2)i+1 )].
    Finally, we need a map Q(σ 2 ((u + 2)qu+2 )) → Q(σ 2 (u)) which we deﬁne by

     (0, [σ 2 ((u + 2)qu+2 ), σ 2 (u + 1)]) : P (σ 2((u + 2)qu+2 )) → P (σ(u − 1)) ⊕ P (σ 2 (u + 1))

in degree 0. Note that this is a map of complexes since σ 2 ((u + 2)qu+2 ), σ 2 (u + 1), σ 2(u) are
not consecutive edges.
    Clearly, all maps deﬁned above are not homotopic to zero.
    In order to complete the proof we have to check that they satisfy the deﬁning relations
of Ω(1) (T ∗ , σ ∗ , θ), up to homotopy.
    (1) Non-consecutive edges. We only have to check sequences of edges where one of the
new complexes occurs. (For the stalk complexes it directly follows from the same relations
in A that non-consecutive edges give zero relations.)
    The edges (u − 1)pu−1 , σ    e2 (u), σ 2 (u + 1) are not consecutive in the order p(T ∗ , σ ∗ ). The
corresponding composition of maps of complexes, as deﬁned above, is given by ﬁrst mapping
to the ﬁrst summand in degree 0, then projecting onto the second summand. Clearly,
this composition is zero. Similarly, the inner edges σ((u + 2)qu+2 ), σ         e(u), u − 1 are not
consecutive. The corresponding composition of maps of complexes ﬁrst maps into the
second summand in degree 0 and then projects onto the ﬁrst summand, which is obviously
zero.
    (2) Socle relations. From the above deﬁnitions, it is easy to check that for all edges
f corresponding to stalk complexes the socle map Q(f ) → Q(σ ∗ (f )) is just given by the
socle map P (f ) → P (σ(f )). Then the socle relations immediately follow from the socle
relations of A. (Clearly, around the endpoint of f not attached to the cycle, we also deﬁne
              Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras     23


Q(f ) → Q(σ ∗ (f )) by the same socle map.) So it only remains to prove the socle relations
for the new complexes Q(σ j (u)). Again, it suﬃces to consider

                  Q(σ(u)) : 0 → P (u − 1) ⊕ P (σ(u + 1)) → P (σ(u)) → 0.

Around the one endpoint of σ    e(u) we obtain the map C1∗ : Q(σ(u)) → Q(σ 2 (u)) which is
given by the socle map P (u − 1) → P (σ(u − 1)) on the ﬁrst summand in degree 0. Around
the other endpoint we obtain the map C2∗ given by the socle map P (σ(u+1)) → P (σ 2 (u+1))
on the second summand in degree 0. Both maps are zero in degree −1.
    In order to satisfy the relations of Ω(1) (T ∗ , σ ∗ , θ) these maps have to be homotopic (up
to the scalar θ in case of the distinguished edge involved). By assumption, u − 1 and u + 1
are not in the σ-orbit of the distinguished edge 1. In particular, the distinguished edge
remains on the cycle of End(Q). For checking the relation involving the scalar θ, we can
assume that σ(u) = 1 is the distinguished edge (otherwise, set θ = 1 in the sequel). Then
the map C1∗ − θC2∗ is homotopic to zero via the homotopy map

     ([σ(u), σ(u − 1)], −θ[σ(u), σ 2 (u + 1)]) : P (σ(u)) → P (σ(u − 1)) ⊕ P (σ 2 (u + 1)).

(For checking the details, one also repeatedly uses the fact that non-consecutive edges in
the order of T give zero relations.)
   This completes the proof of Proposition 4.1.

5. Derived normal forms for the algebras Ω(1)

    In this section we indicate how one can combine the reduction steps in the previous
sections to obtain a proof of the fact that any algebra Ω(1) (T, σ, θ) is derived equivalent to
one of the normal forms Λ(p, q, k, s, θ).
    We can actually prove the following more precise result.

Theorem 5.1. Let A = Ω(1) (T, σs , θ) be an algebra as defined in Section 1, where the
cycle of T has length k. Denote by o(T ) the (total) number of outer edges in T , and by
i(T ) the (total) number of inner edges in T . Then A is derived equivalent to the normal
form Λ(p′ , q ′ , k ′ , s′ , θ), where the parameters p′ , q ′ , k ′ , s′ are given as follows
    p′ = gcd(s,k)
            k
                     · o(T ) + gcd(s,k)−1
                                       2
                                              ,
     ′   gcd(s,k)                 gcd(s,k)−1
    q = k · i(T ) +                    2
                                             ,
      ′     k
    k = gcd(s,k) ,
            s
    s′ = gcd(s,k)  .

Remark. It might not be obvious that the parameters p′ and q ′ as given in the theorem
are actually natural numbers. Let us recall the assumptions on the parameters s, k in the
deﬁnition of Ω(1) (T, σs , θ), where T has a cycle of length k > 2 (see Section 1).
   The assumption for the one-parametric algebras has been that 1 6 s 6 k − 1 and
gcd(s + 2, k) = 1. In particular, this implies that gcd(s, k) is odd, that is, the second
summand in the formulae for p′ and q ′ is an integer.

   The automorphism σs is just rotation of T by s steps on the cycle of length k. Hence,
                                              k
the order of σs (as an automorphism) is gcd(s,k) . In particular, the σs -orbit of any edge (or
                                    k
any vertex) consists of exactly gcd(s,k) edges (or vertices). The group generated by σs acts
                                                                    k
on the outer (and inner) edges of T . Hence, the orbit length gcd(s,k)    divides the numbers
                                                   ′      ′
o(T ) and i(T ). In particular, the formulae for p and q actually give natural numbers.
Proof of Theorem 5.1. Let A = Ω(1) (T, σs , θ) be an algebra as deﬁned in Section 1,
with a cycle of length k. For the proof of the theorem we need to have a very detailed look
at the reduction steps of the previous sections. In particular, we need to know how the
parameters s, k, o(T ), i(T ) occurring on the right hand side are changed in each step.
    The ﬁrst reduction step Proposition 2.1 states that, up to derived equivalence, the
inner and outer Brauer trees can be made into stars, that is, all edges have level at most
1. The cycle of T remains unchanged, as does the automorphism σs . So, the parameters
considered in the statement of the theorem are not aﬀected by this ﬁrst reduction step.
    The second reduction    step Proposition 3.1 states that A is derived equivalent to an
           (1)
algebra Ω      T , σs , θ where all edges of level 1 are attached to some vertex in the σs -orbit
of one ﬁxed vertex v. Recall that in this second reduction step inner (resp. outer) edges
remain inner (resp. outer) edges. In particular, the numbers o(T ) and i(T ) are not changed
by this reduction step. Note also that again the cycle and the automorphism σs are not
changed.
    We can determine the number of outer and inner edges attached to each vertex in the
σs -orbit of the ﬁxed vertex v of T . There are o(T ) outer edges in total; they are equally
                           k
distributed to the gcd(s,k)  vertices in the σs -orbit. Hence, at each such a vertex we have
gcd(s,k)
   k
              outer and gcd(s,k)
         ·o(T )            k
                                 ·i(T ) inner edges attached. Note that these terms are exactly
the ﬁrst summands in the formulae for p′ and q ′ .
    In the third reduction step Proposition 4.1 the length k of the cycle and the rotation
parameter s are changed. Recall the situation of Proposition 4.1. We assume that there
are two consecutive vertices on the cycle of T with no edges of level 1 attached to them
(i.e., these vertices are not in the σs -orbit of the distinguished vertex v). The adjacent
edges were denoted u − 1, u, u + 1. Then, up to derived equivalence, we can change the
Brauer graph T to the Brauer graph T ∗ where all edges in the σs -orbit of u − 1 become
inner edges of level 1, and all edges in the σs -orbit of u + 1 become outer edges of level 1.
By applying again our second reduction step (moving edges), if necessary, we can assume
that the new inner and outer edges are also attached to vertices in the σs -orbit of the ﬁxed
vertex v (recall that this second reduction step does not aﬀect the parameters).
                                                                                 k
    We have to determine how the parameters s and k are changed. The gcd(s,k)        vertices in
the σs -orbit of the ﬁxed vertex v of T are at equal distance apart from each other, where
this distance is gcd(s, k) (the length of the cycle divided by the length of the orbit). By
Proposition 4.1, in each of the intervals between two vertices of the σs -orbit of v, two edges
on the cycle become edges of level 1. Hence, the length of the cycle of T ∗ is given by
                   k                                                                   s
k1 := k − 2 · gcd(s,k) . Concerning the rotation parameter, there are exactly gcd(s,k)     such
intervals between the ﬁxed vertex v and σs (v). Hence, the automorphism σ rotates T ∗ by
                                                                                ∗
               Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras                          25


                   s
s1 := s − 2 · gcd(s,k)   .
    We can now apply the third reduction step inductively. We set k0 = k and s0 = s. After
i iterations we obtain a Brauer graph T(i)    ∗
                                                  with a cycle of length ki := ki−1 − 2 · gcd(ski−1
                                                                                                 i−1
                                                                                                    ,ki−1 )
and rotation parameter si := si−1 − 2 · gcd(ssi−1   i−1
                                                      ,ki−1 )
                                                              .
    By our assumptions we know that the length gcd(s, k) of the intervals is odd (see the
preceding remark). So, after gcd(s,k)−1   2
                                                iterations we get a Brauer graph for which the
intervals are of length 1, that is, the action of the rotation is transitive. The corresponding
algebra is one of the normal forms Λ(p′ , q ′, k ′ , s′ , θ), that is, we completed the proof of the
implication (1) ⇒ (2) in our main result Theorem 1.
    It remains to determine the parameters for the normal forms.
    After the second reduction step, in the Brauer graph T we have gcd(s,k)        k
                                                                                        · o(T ) outer
              gcd(s,k)
edges and        k
                        · i(T ) inner edges attached to each vertex in the σs -orbit of the ﬁxed
vertex v.
    After gcd(s,k)−1
                 2
                         iterations of the third reduction step we get at each of these vertices
          gcd(s,k)−1
exactly        2
                       additional outer and inner edges. This proves the formulae for p′ and q ′
given in Theorem 5.1.
    Closed formulae for the number k ′ of edges on the cycle and the rotation parameter
s′ are provided by the following observation on the numbers ki and si which were deﬁned
inductively above.
Claim: For any i = 0, . . . , gcd(s,k)−1

                                         , we have ki = k ·        gcd(s,k)−2i
                                                                     gcd(s,k)
                                                                                 and si = s ·       gcd(s,k)−2i
                                                                                                      gcd(s,k)
                                                                                                                .
Proof of the claim. We ﬁrst prove by induction that gcd(si , ki ) = gcd(s, k) − 2i.
   By deﬁnition, this holds for i = 0. Let i > 0. Then

                                                           2                               2

by induction.
   Using this formula for the gcd(si , ki ), the formulae for ki and si now follow easily by
induction. This completes the proof of the claim.
    Recall that we got to our normal form Λ(p′ , q ′ , k ′ , s′ , θ) after exactly i = gcd(s,k)−1
                                                                                            2

easily computed to be k ′ = k gcd(s,k)−1 = gcd(s,k)   and the rotation parameter is equal to

using the notation of Theorem 5.1, we have o(T ) = 14, i(T ) = 6 and thus obtain p′ = 8,
q ′ = 4, k ′ = 2, and s′ = 1. Therefore, for θ ∈ K\ {0}, the algebra Ω(1) (T, σ3 , θ) is derived
equivalent to Λ (8, 4, 2, 1, θ) = Ω(1) (T8,4,2 , σ1 , θ), where the Brauer graph T8,4,2 is of the form

6. Derived normal forms for the algebras Ω(2)

    The aim of this section is to indicate a proof of the following derived equivalence
classiﬁcation for the algebras Ω(2) (T, v1 , v2 ) as deﬁned in Section 1.

Proposition 6.1. Any algebra Ω(2) (T, v1 , v2 ) is derived equivalent to the normal form Γ∗ (n)
where n + 2 is the number of simple modules of Ω(2) (T, v1 , v2 ).
   In particular, two algebras in the family Ω(2) are derived equivalent if and only if they
have the same number of simple modules.

   The algebras Ω(2) (T, v1 , v2 ) are very similar to weakly symmetric algebras of Euclidean
type studied in [7]. The diﬀerence only consists of a few relations which interchange the
socles of two projective indecomposable modules making Ω(2) (T, v1 , v2 ) selﬁnjective but not
weakly symmetric. Apart from that, all remaining relations are the same.
               Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras        27


    In [7, Section 4] we established the derived normal forms Γ (n) for the weakly symmetric
algebras Γ(2) (T, v1 , v2 ). It turned out that the normal forms Γ (n) are very similar to our
new normal forms Γ∗ (n), up to a twist in the relations, exactly corresponding to the twist
in the relations for going from Γ(2) (T, v1 , v2 ) to Ω(2) (T, v1 , v2 ). In fact, the algebra Γ∗ (n)
is given by the following quiver and relations

and Γ (n) is obtained from Γ∗ (n) by replacing the relations α2 α1 = 0 and γ2 γ1 = 0 by the
relations α2 γ1 = 0 and γ2 α1 = 0.
    Because of the similarities described above it is therefore not surprising that the proof
for the derived equivalence classiﬁcation of the weakly symmetric algebras carries over
almost verbatim to our new situation. We refrain from repeating the proof here, and refer
for details to our previous paper [7, Section 4].

7. Auslander-Reiten sequences

    In order to prove Theorem 1, we need more detailed information on the Auslander-
Reiten quivers of standard one-parametric selﬁnjective algebras and the action of Heller’s
syzygy operator on their stable module categories.
    Let A be a selﬁnjective algebra. We denote by ΓA the Auslander-Reiten quiver of A
and by τA and τA−1 the Auslander-Reiten translations D Tr and Tr D, respectively. We will
identify an indecomposable module M from mod A with the vertex [M] of ΓA corresponding
to it. Further, we denote by ΓsA the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of A, obtained from
ΓA by removing the projective modules and the arrows attached to them. Recall also
that for an indecomposable projective A-module P we have in mod A an Auslander-Reiten
sequence of the form

                         0 −→ rad P −→ rad P/S ⊕ P −→ P/S −→ 0,

where S is the socle of P [5, Proposition V.5.5]. Finally, we denote by ΩA Heller’s syzygy
28                                 R. Bocian, T. Holm and A. Skowroński


operator on mod A which assigns to any module M the kernel of its projective cover
P (M) −→ M.
    The ﬁrst result of this section describes the shape of the stable Auslander-Reiten quivers
of the algebras Γ∗ (n).

                                                                                  ZD
Proposition 7.1. ΓsΓ∗ (n) consists of one Euclidean component e 2n+3 , two stable tubes of
rank 2, one stable tube of rank 2n+ 1, and a family of stable tubes of rank 1 indexed by
K\ {0}.

Proof. It follows from [11, Section 2] and [7, Proposition 5.3] that Γ∗ (n) ∼

type (2, 2, 2n+ 1), and so C (n) is a representation-inﬁnite tilted algebra of Euclidean type
De 2n+3 (see [32, (4.9)]). Hence the required shape of Γs ∗ follows from [3, Section 4] and
                                                        Γ (n)
[35, Section 2].

   Our next aim is to describe the shape of the stable Auslander-Reiten quivers of the
algebras Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and the structure of modules lying on the mouth of their large
stable tubes.
   Let p, q, k, s be integers such that p, q > 0, k > 2, 1 6 s 6 k − 1, gcd (s, k) = 1,
and gcd (s + 2, k) = 1. Since gcd (s + 2, k) = 1, there is exactly one integer mk,s such that
1 6 mk,s 6 k − 1, and
                                 mk,s (s + 2) + 1 ≡ 0 (mod k) .
By deﬁnition, Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) is the bound quiver algebra
                                                                     (1)
                     Ω(1) (Tp,q,k , σs , θ) = KQ (Tp,q,k , σs ) /I         (Tp,q,k , σs , θ) ,

where the vertices of the quiver Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) are the edges of the Brauer graph Tp,q,k , and
there is an arrow i −→ j in Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) if j is the direct successor of i in the partial order
p (Tp,q,k , σs ), as deﬁned in Section 1. We note that Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) is a special biserial algebra
              Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras       29


[36]. Moreover, since we compose the arrows in Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) from left to right, the category
mod Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) of ﬁnite dimensional (left) Λ (p, q, k, s, θ)-modules is identiﬁed with the
category of ﬁnite dimensional representations (over    K) of the bound quiver opposite to
                                     (1)
the bound quiver Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) , I (Tp,q,k , σs , θ) . For each edge i of Tp,q,k , we denote by
S (i) the simple Λ (p, q, k, s, θ)-module at i, and by P (i) the projective cover of S (i) in
mod Λ (p, q, k, s, θ). The edges of Tp,q,k of the form ir , 1 6 i 6 k, 1 6 r 6 p, are said
to be outer edges of Tp,q,k , while the edges of the form il , 1 6 i 6 k, 1 6 l 6 q, are
said to be the inner edges of Tp,q,k . We call the simple modules S (ir ) the outer simple
modules and the simple modules S (il ) the inner simple modules. We describe now the
structure of indecomposable projective Λ (p, q, k, s, θ)-modules. Since Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) is a
special biserial algebra, every indecomposable projective Λ (p, q, k, s, θ)-module P is either
serial (has a unique composition series) or biserial (rad P/ soc P is a direct sum of two
serial modules). Observe also, that for each vertex i of Q (Tp,q,k , σs ), the vertex σs (i) is
                                                                                   (1)
the target of maximal paths in Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) with source i which are not in I (Tp,q,k , σs , θ),
and hence S (i) is the socle of the projective module P (σs (i)). This also shows that the
action of σs on the vertices of Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) is exactly the Nakayama permutation of the
algebra Λ (p, q, k, s, θ). For each outer edge ir of Tp,q,k , the path

ir → . . . → ip → i+s → (i+s)1 → . . . → (i+s)q → i+s−1 → (i+s)1 → . . . → (i+s)r = σs (ir )

is the unique path in Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) from ir to σs (ir ) of length at least 2 which is not in
  (1)
I (Tp,q,k , σs , θ), and consequently P ((i+s)r ) is the serial module with socle S (ir ), and
the simple composition factors given by the simple modules at the vertices of this path.
Similarly, for each inner edge il of Tp,q,k , the path

     il → . . . → iq → i−1 → i1 → . . . → ip → i+s → (i+s)1 → . . . → (i+s)l = σs (il )

is the unique path in Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) from il to σs (il ) of length at least 2 which is not in
  (1)
I (Tp,q,k , σs , θ), and consequently P ((i+s)l ) is the serial module with socle S (il ), and
the simple composition factors given by the simple modules at the vertices of this path.
Finally, for an edge i of the cycle of Tp,q,k , we have two paths in Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) from i to
                                 (1)
σs (i) = i+s which are not in I (Tp,q,k , σs ), and they are of the forms

     i → (i+1)1 → . . . → (i+1)p → i+1+s → (i+1+s)1 → . . . → (i+1+s)q → i+s,

                      i → i1 → . . . → iq → i−1 → i1 → . . . → ip → i+s.
Hence, P (i+s) is the biserial module with socle S (i), and
                                                          rad P (i+s)    / soc P (i+s) is the
                                                                                             
direct sum of two serial modules: one with the top S (i+1+s)q , the socle S (i+1)1 ,
and the simple composition factors formed by the simple modules at the vertices of the
ﬁrst path, and the second with the top S (ip ), the socle S (i1 ), and the simple composition
factors formed by the simple modules at the vertices of the second path. We also note that,
for p = 0, any path of the form i → (i+1)1 → . . . → (i+1)p → i+1+s is reduced to the
30                                  R. Bocian, T. Holm and A. Skowroński


arrow i → i+1+s. Similarly, for q = 0, any path of the form i → i1 → . . . → iq → i−1 is
reduced to the arrow i → i−1. For i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}, we denote by U (i) the factor module
of P (i) by the unique serial submodule with the top S ((i−s)p ), if p > 1, and S (i−s−1)
if p = 0. Similarly, for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}, we 
                                                   denote by
                                                           V (i) the factor module of P (i) by
the unique serial submodule with the top S (i+1)q , if q > 1, and S (i+1) if q = 0.
    The following proposition describes the stable Auslander-Reiten quivers of the algebras
Λ (p, q, k, s, θ).

Proof. Let Λ = Λ (p, q, k, s, θ), Q = Q (Tp,q,k , σs ) and I = I (Tp,q,k , σs , θ). We know
that Λ is a special biserial one-parametric selﬁnjective algebra (see Theorem 1.3). Then it
follows from [17, Theorem 2.1] that ΓsΛ consists of one Euclidean component e r and a              ZA

of rank 1 indexed (say) by K \ {0}. Moreover, if ΓsΛ admits two stable tubes of ranks m

ΓsΛ admits the required stable tubes Tp,q,k,s        out                               inn
                                                           of rank (2p + 1) k and Tp,q,k,s  of rank (2q + 1) k.
We will apply the known formulae for the Auslander-Reiten sequences of string modules
over special biserial algebras (see [15, Chapter II]). We also note that the ideal I is not an
admissible ideal of the path algebra KQ. Indeed, for any outer edge ir of Tp,q,k we have
C (ir , p (Tp,q,k , σs , vi )) − C (ir , p (Tp,q,k , σs , w (i)r )) ∈ I, where v (i) is the vertex of ir on the
unique cycle of Tp,q,k and w (i)r the second (outer) vertex of ir , and C (ir , p (Tp,q,k , σs , w (i)r ))
is the arrow ir → σs (ir ). We call the arrow ir → σs (ir ) a superﬂuous arrow of the bound
quiver Q, I . Similarly, for any inner edge il of Tp,q,k we have C (il , p (Tp,q,k , σs , vi )) −
C (il , p (Tp,q,k , σs , w (i)l )) ∈ I, where v (i) is the vertex of il on the unique cycle of Tp,q,k and
w (i)l the second (inner) vertex of il , and C (il , p (Tp,q,k , σs , w (i)l )) is the arrow      il → σs (il ).
We call the arrow il → σs (il ) a superﬂuous arrow of the bound quiver Q, I .

and hence U (i) = τΛ U (i+s+2). Since gcd (s+2, k) = 1, we infer that the modules

the modules L (1) , L (2) , . . . , L (k) are indecomposable.
      Assume now p > 1. Fix i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}. Note that the quiver Q contains a string of
the form
    ip → i+s ← (i+s+1)q ← . . . ← (i+s+1)1 ← i+s+1 ← (i+1)p ← . . . ← (i+1)1 ,
and denote by L (i) the associated string Λ-module. Then we have in mod Λ an Auslander-

and hence S (ip ) = τΛ U (i+s). Moreover, we have U (i+s) = rad P (i+s+1)1 . Further,
Q contains also a string of the form
          i1 ← i−1 → (i−1)1 → . . . → (i−1)q → i−2 → (i−1)1 → . . . → (i−1)p ,
and denote by M (i) the associated string Λ-module. Then we have in mod Λ an Auslander-

and hence P ((i−1)p ) /S ((i−1−s)p ) = τΛ S (i1 ). Observe that S ((i−1−s)p ) = soc P ((i−1)p ).
Finally, if p > 2, we have in Q a path
                                         i1 → i2 → . . . → ip ,
and, for r ∈ {1, . . . , p−1}, ir → ir+1 is the unique nonsuperﬂuous arrow in Q starting at ir
(respectively, ending in ir+1 ). Then we have in mod Λ Auslander-Reiten sequences of the

consequently S (ir ) = τΛ S (ir+1 ). Observe also that ΩΛ S (ir ) = rad P (ir ). Therefore,
S (ir ) = τΛ S (ir+1 ) implies rad P (ir ) = τΛ rad P (ir+1 ), for r ∈ {1, . . . , p−1}, p > 2.
Combining the calculations above and invoking again our assumption gcd (s+2, k) = 1, we
conclude that the modules U (i), S (ir ), P (ir ) / soc P (ir ), 1 6 i 6 k, 1 6 r 6 p, form the

     Assume now q > 1. Fix i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}. Observe that Q contains a string of the
form

 ip → i−1 ← (i−1−s)p ← . . . ← (i−1−s)1 ← i−2−s ← (i−1−s)q ← . . . ← (i−1−s)1 ,

and denote by R (i) the associated string Λ-module. Then we have in mod Λ an Auslander-
Reiten sequence of the form

and hence S (iq ) = τΛ V (i−1). Moreover, we have V (i−1) = rad P ((i−1)1 ). Further, Q

rad P (il ) = τΛ rad P il+1 . Moreover, observe that τΛ2q+1 S (i1 ) = S ((i+s)1 ) for any i ∈

the formulae on the actions of τΛ on T       and T         established in the proof of Proposition
7.2.
     (1) It is enough to prove that

Assume p = 0. Observe that Ω−       Λ U (1) = U (s+2). Moreover, we have τΛ

U (1+(m+1) (s+2)) = U (s+3+m (s+2)) = U (s+2), since m (s+2) + 1 ≡ 0 (mod k)
                                                                   −(m+1)
implies s + 3 + m (s+2) ≡ s + 2 (mod k). Hence, Ω−    Λ U (1) = τΛ         U (1), or equivalently
              m+1
ΩΛ U (1) = τΛ U (1).
Assume p > 1. In this case, we have U (1) = rad P (21 ), and then Ω−                        1
                                                                            Λ U (1) = S (2 ). We
have τΛ−p−1 U (1) = τΛ−p−1 rad P (21 ) = τΛ− τΛ−p rad P (21 ) = τΛ− P (2p ) / soc P (2p ) = S (31 )

                           m(2p+1)+p+1
equivalently ΩΛ U (1) = τΛ             U (1).
     (2) It is enough to prove that

Assume q = 0. Observe that ΩΛ V (1) = V (2) and τΛk−m V (1) = V (1+(k−m) (s+2)).
Then ΩΛ V (1) = τΛk−m V (1), because m (s+2)+1 ≡ 0 (mod k) implies 1+(k−m) (s+2) ≡
2 (mod k).
Assume q > 1. In this case, we have V (1) = rad P (11 ) = ΩΛ S (11 ). Hence ΩΛ V (1) =

Ω2Λ S (11 ). Thus ΩΛ V (1) = τΛ                 V (1) is equivalent to V (1) = τΛ             S (11 ).
             (k−m)(2q+1)−q
We have τΛ                 S (11 ) = S ((1+(k−m) (s+2))1 ) = S (21 ), because m (s+2)+ 1 ≡
                                                                              (k−m)(2q+1)−q
0 (mod k) implies 1+(k−m) (s+2) ≡ 2 (mod k). Therefore, we obtain τΛ                        S (11 ) =

τΛ S (21 ) = τΛ S (2q ) = V (1), as required.

algebras of Euclidean type e m .    A
   Let T be a Brauer graph with exactly one cycle Rk , having an odd number k of
edges. Take the trivial rotation σs = σ0 (with s = 0) of T . Observe that gcd (s+2, k) =
gcd (2, k) = 1. Moreover, for each vertex v of T , the cyclic order p (T, σ0 , v), as deﬁned

in Section 1, is the cyclic order of edges of the Brauer graph T adjacent to v. Then,
for θ ∈ K\ {0}, consider the algebra Ω(1) (T, θ) = Ω(1) (T, σ0 , θ). For θ = 1, the algebra
Ω(1) (T, 1) is just the one-parametric special biserial algebra Λ′ (T ) considered in [7], [9] and
[10]. In general, Ω(1) (T, θ) is a one-parametric weakly symmetric special biserial algebra
which is socle equivalent to Ω(1) (T, 1) = Λ′ (T ).
    For p, q > 1 and k = 1, consider the Brauer graph Tp,q = Tp,q,1 of the form

                                                    1
                                                         11
                                          1p
                                                         12

                                          11         1q



Further, for θ ∈ K\ {0}, consider the algebras Λ (p, q, θ) = Λ (p, q, 1, 0, θ). Then Λ (p, q, θ)
is a one-parametric weakly symmetric special biserial algebra given by the quiver

We also note that for p = q = 0, Λ (0, 0, θ) is the local 4-dimensional algebra A (θ) =
K hα, βi / (α2 , β 2 , αβ − θβα), and for p + q > 1 and θ = 1, Λ (p, q, 1) is the symmetric
algebra A (p+1, q+1) considered in [7].
   The following proposition is then a direct consequence of arguments applied in the
proofs of Proposition 2.1 and Theorem 5.1.
Theorem 8.1. Let T be a Brauer graph with exactly one cycle, having an odd number k
of edges. Denote by p the total number of outer edges of T and by q the total number of
inner edges of T . Then, for any θ ∈ K\ {0}, the algebra Ω(1) (T, θ) is derived equivalent to
Λ (p′ , q ′, θ), where p′ = p+ k−1

                                   and q ′ = q+ k−1

    We also note that, in the symmetric case θ = 1, the above proposition is related with
[23, Theorem 2.3].
    As we noticed above, for p, q > 1 and θ ∈ K\ {0}, the algebras Λ (p, q, θ) and Λ (p, q, 1)
are socle equivalent (the factor algebras by the socles are isomorphic). Then the following
two propositions follow directly from [7, Propositions 5.3 and 5.4] and their proofs.

Proposition 8.2. For p, q > 0 and θ ∈ K\ {0}, the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver ΓsΛ(p,q,θ)
                                           ZA
consists of one Euclidean component e 2(p+q)+1 , an outer stable tube Tp,q,θ
                                                                          out
                                                                              of rank 2p+1,
                       inn
an inner stable tube Tp,q,θ of rank 2q+1, and a family of stable tubes of rank 1.

Proposition 8.3. For p, q > 0 and θ ∈ K\ {0}, we have
                                               out                   p+1           out
   (1) ΩΛ(p,q,θ) fixes the outer stable tube Tp,q,θ and ΩΛ(p,q,θ) = τΛ(p,q,θ) on Tp,q,θ .
                                               inn                   q+1           inn
   (2) ΩΛ(p,q,θ) fixes the inner stable tube Tp,q,θ and ΩΛ(p,q,θ) = τΛ(p,q,θ) on Tp,q,θ .

   For the proof of Theorem 1, we need the following result.

Proposition 8.4. Let p, p′, q, q ′ > 0, k > 2 and s be integers with 1 6 s 6 k − 1,
gcd (s+2, k) = 1, gcd (s, k) = 1, and θ, θ′ ∈ K\ {0}. Then the algebras Λ (p, q, k, s, θ)
and Λ (p′ , q ′ , θ) are not stably equivalent.

Proof. Suppose that the algebras Λ = Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Λ′ = Λ (p′ , q ′ , θ) are stably
equivalent, and let F : mod Λ −→ mod Λ′ be a functor inducing a stable equivalence.
Since Λ and Λ′ are selﬁnjective algebras of Loewy length at least 3, applying [5, (X.1.9),
(X.1.12)], we have F τΛ = τΛ′ F and F ΩΛ = ΩΛ′ F . In particular, the stable Auslander-
Reiten quivers ΓsΛ and ΓsΛ′ are isomorphic translation quivers. Further, since k > 2, it
follows from Proposition 7.2 that the stable tubes TΛout and TΛinn have ranks at least 2.
Then, applying Proposition 8.2, we conclude that ΓsΛ′ has two stable tubes of ranks at
least 2, and hence the stable tubes TΛout
                                        ′ and TΛinn
                                                 ′  are unique stable tubes of ranks at least
       s                           ′ ′
2 in ΓΛ′ . In particular, we have p , q > 1 and
                                             	                	
                             F TΛout , F TΛinn = TΛout        inn
                                                        ′ , TΛ′     .

If F (TΛout ) = TΛout
                   ′  then, applying Propositions 7.2, 7.3, 8.2 and 8.3, we get the equalities

                       (2p+1) k = 2p′ +1 and m (2p+1)+p+1 = p′ +1,

where m = mk,s is such that m (s+2)+1 ≡ 0 (mod k). Similarly, if F (TΛout ) = TΛinn
                                                                                 ′ , we

get the equalities

                       (2p+1) k = 2q ′ +1 and m (2p+1)+p+1 = q ′ +1.

The both cases force k = 2m+1. On the other hand, m (s+2)+1 ≡ 0 (mod k) is equivalent
to (2m+1)+sm ≡ 0 (mod k). Hence k = 2m+1 implies 2m+1|sm, a contradiction, because
1 6 s 6 k−1 = 2m and gcd (2m+1, s) = gcd (k, s) = 1.

9. Proof of Theorem 1

    The aim of this section is to complete the proof of Theorem 1. The implication (1) =⇒
(2) follows from Theorem 5.1 and Proposition 6.1. The implication (2) =⇒ (3) is the direct
consequence of the following general result proved by J. Rickard.
Proposition 9.1. Let A and Λ be derived equivalent selfinjective algebras. Then A and Λ
are stably equivalent.

Proof. See [29, Corollary 2.2].

     We will need also the following general result.
Proposition 9.2. Let A and Λ be stably equivalent selfinjective algebras, and assume that
Λ is symmetric of Loewy length at least 3. Then A is weakly symmetric.

Proof. See [7, Proposition 5.2].

    We are now in position to prove the implication (3) =⇒ (1) of Theorem 1. Let A
be a standard selﬁnjective algebra which is stably equivalent to an algebra of the form
Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) or Γ∗ (n). Then the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver ΓsA of A is isomorphic
either to ΓsΛ(p,q,k,s,θ) or to ΓΓ∗ (n) . In particular, A is a one-parametric selﬁnjective algebra of
                     A                 D
an Euclidean type e 2(p+q+1)k−1 or e 2n+3 (see [35] and Propositions 7.1 and 7.2). Moreover,
since the algebras Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Γ∗ (n) are not weakly symmetric, applying Proposition
9.2, we conclude that A is not symmetric. Then applying the main results of [9], [10]
and [11] we obtain that A is isomorphic to an algebra of one of the forms Ω(1) (T, σs , θ),
Ω(1) (T, θ), or Ω(2) (T, v1 , v2 ). Suppose A is isomorphic to an algebra Ω(1) (T, θ). Then it
follows from Theorem 8.1 and Proposition 9.1 that A is stably equivalent to an algebra of
the form Λ (p′ , q ′, θ′ ), for same p′ , q ′ > 0 and θ′ ∈ K\ {0}. Moreover, by our assumption (3),
A is stably equivalent to an algebra Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) or Γ∗ (n). Since the stable Auslander-
Reiten quivers ΓsΛ(p′ ,q′ ,θ′ ) and ΓΓ∗(n) have, by Propositions 7.1 and 8.2, the unique Euclidean
components of diﬀerent types, we conclude that A is stably equivalent simultaneously to
an algebra Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and to an algebra Λ (p′ , q ′, θ′ ). But this contradicts Proposition
8.4. Therefore, the implication (3) =⇒ (1) holds. This ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 1.

10. Stable equivalences

    It follows from Proposition 7.1 that two algebras Γ∗ (m) and Γ∗ (n) are stably equivalent
if and only if m = n, or equivalently Γ∗ (m) and Γ∗ (n) are isomorphic. Clearly, two algebras
Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Γ∗ (n) are never stably equivalent, because their stable Auslander-Reiten
quivers are not isomorphic. The following proposition gives necessary conditions for two
algebras Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Λ (p′ , q ′, k ′ , s′ , θ′ ) to be stably equivalent.
Proposition 10.1. Let Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Λ (p′ , q ′ , k ′ , s′ , θ′ ) be stably equivalent algebras.
Then one of two cases holds:
               Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras              37


     (1) p = p′ , q = q ′ , k = k ′ , s = s′ ;
     (2) p = q ′ , q = p′ , k = k ′ , s =
                                        6 s′ , mk,s + mk′ ,s′ = k − 1.

Proof. We abbreviate Λ = Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Λ′ = Λ (p′ , q ′ , k ′ , s′ , θ′ ). We have

              p, q > 0, k > 2, 1 6 s 6 k − 1, gcd (s, k) = 1, gcd (s + 2, k) = 1,

           p′ , q ′ > 0, k ′ > 2, 1 6 s′ 6 k ′ − 1, gcd (s′ , k ′ ) = 1, gcd (s′ + 2, k ′ ) = 1.
We also note that since k > 2 and k ′ > 2, Λ and Λ′ are of Loewy length at least 3, and then
for any stable equivalence F : mod Λ −→ mod Λ′ we have F τΛ = τΛ′ F and F ΩΛ = ΩΛ′ F
(see [5, (X.1.9), (X.1.12)]). Recall also that ΓsΛ has exactly two large stable tubes: the
              out                                                    inn
outer tube Tp,q,k,s         of rank (2p+1) k and the inner tube Tp,q,k,s of rank (2q+1) k. Similary,
ΓΛ′ has exactly two large stable tubes: the outer tube Tp′ ,q′ ,k′,s′ of rank (2p′ +1) k ′ and the
  s                                                                 out

inner tube Tpinn                         ′     ′
              ′ ,q ′ ,k ′ ,s′ of rank (2q +1) k . Since the stable Auslander-Reiten quivers of Λ and

Λ′ are isomorphic, we obtain

                        {(2p+1) k, (2q+1) k} = {(2p′ +1) k ′ , (2q ′ +1) k ′ } .

Hence, we get
                          (2p+1) k+(2q+1) k = (2p′ +1) k ′ +(2q ′ +1) k ′ ,
and consequently the equality

                                     k (p+q+1) = k ′ (p′ +q ′ +1) .

    Let m = mk,s and m′ = mk′ ,s′ . We have the congruences

                   m (s+2)+1 ≡ 0 (mod k) and m′ (s′ +2)+1 ≡ 0 (mod k ′ ) ,

or equivalently

                 (2m+1)+sm ≡ 0 (mod k) and (2m′ +1)+s′ m′ ≡ 0 (mod k ′ ) .

Hence gcd (m, k) = 1 and gcd (m′ , k ′ ) = 1. Then gcd (s, k) = 1 and gcd (s′ , k ′ ) = 1 imply
gcd (2m+1, k) = 1 and gcd (2m′ +1, k ′ ) = 1.
                                                                  out
     We have two cases to consider. Assume ﬁrst that Tp,q,k,s         = Tpout                      inn
                                                                             ′ ,q ′ ,k ′ ,s′ and Tp,q,k,s =
  inn                                                           s      s
Tp′ ,q′ ,k′ ,s′ . Comparing the ranks of large stable tubes of ΓΛ and ΓΛ′ , we then have

                       (2p+1) k = (2p′ +1) k ′ and (2q+1) k = (2q ′ +1) k ′ .

Further, comparing the actions of ΩΛ and ΩΛ′ on the large stable tubes, we obtain from
Proposition 7.3 the equalities

   m (2p+1)+p+1 = m′ (2p′ +1)+p′ +1 and (k−m) (2q+1)−q = (k ′ −m′ ) (2q ′ +1)−q ′ .
38                                R. Bocian, T. Holm and A. Skowroński


Moreover, the second equality and (2q+1) k = (2q ′ +1) k ′ imply m (2q+1)+q = m′ (2q ′ +1)+
q ′ . Summing up both equalities we obtain (2m+1) (p+q+1) = (2m′ +1) (p′ +q ′ +1). Fi-
nally, invoking the equality k (p+q+1) = k ′ (p′ +q ′ +1), we obtain

                                      (2m+1) k ′ = (2m′ +1) k.

But then gcd (2m+1, k) = 1 and gcd (2m′ +1, k ′) = 1 imply k|k ′ and k ′ |k. Hence k = k ′
and consequently p = p′ , q = q ′ , m = m′ .
                   out
   Assume that Tp,q,k,s = Tpinn                    inn        out
                             ′ ,q ′ ,k ′ ,s′ and Tp,q,k,s = Tp′ ,q ′ ,k ′ ,s′ . Then comparing the ranks of

these tubes, we obtain

                       (2p+1) k = (2q ′ +1) k ′ and (2q+1) k = (2p′ +1) k ′ .

Further, comparing the actions of ΩΛ and ΩΛ′ on these tubes, we obtain from Proposition
7.3 the equalities

     m (2p+1)+p+1 = (k ′ −m′ ) (2q ′ +1)−q ′ and (k−m) (2q+1)−q = m′ (2p′ +1)+p′ +1.

Hence, we obtain

                        m′ (2q ′ +1)+q ′ = k ′ (2q ′ +1)−m (2p+1)−p−1
                                         = k (2p+1)−m (2p+1)−p−1
                                         = (k−m) (2p+1)−p−1.

Summing up, we get the equality

                         (2m′ +1) (p′ +q ′ +1) = (2 (k−m)−1) (p+q+1) .

Invoking again the equality k (p+q+1) = k ′ (p′ +q ′ +1), we obtain

                                   (2m′ +1) k = (2 (k−m)−1) k ′ .

We have gcd (2m′ +1, k ′) = 1 and gcd (2m+1, k) = 1. Moreover, gcd (2m+1, k) = 1 implies
gcd (2 (k−m)−1, k) = 1. Therefore, k|k ′ and k ′ |k, and so k = k ′ . Then p = q ′ , q = p′ .
Finally, 2m′ +1 = 2 (k−m)−1, and consequently m+m′ = k−1.

    We note that the condition (2) in the above proposition forces k to be odd. Indeed,
if k is even then mk,s and mk′ ,s′ have diﬀerent parity, and this contradicts the congruence
mk,s (s+2)+mk′ ,s′ (s′ +2)+2 ≡ 0 (mod k), because s+2 and s′ +2 are odd by gcd (s, k) = 1
and gcd (s′ , k ′ ) = gcd (s′ , k) = 1.
    We also have the following fact.
Proposition 10.2. Two algebras Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Λ (p′ , q ′ , k ′ , s′ , θ′ ) are isomorphic if
and only if one of the following cases holds:
    (1) p = p′ , q = q ′ , k = k ′ , s = s′ , θ′ = θ;
    (2) p = q ′ , q = p′ , k = k ′ , s 6= s′ , mk,s + mk′ ,s′ = k − 1, θ′ = θ−1 .

         (1)                                                             (1)
ideal I (Tp,q,k,σs , θ), fk,s,s′ (ω) is an element of the ideal I (Tp′ ,q′ ,k′ , σs′ , θ′ ), we need the
following four congruences:
      (i) t (i−1) ≡ t (i)+s′ +1 (mod k),
     (ii) t (i+s) ≡ t (i+s+1)+s′ +1 (mod k),
    (iii) t (i+s+1) ≡ t (i)−1 (mod k),
    (iv) t (i+s) ≡ t (i−1)−1 (mod k).
              Derived equivalence classification of one-parametric selfinjective algebras    41


Observe that it is enough prove the congruences (i) and (iii).
  Let m = mk,s and m′ = mk,s′ . We ﬁrst prove that

                                     ss′ + s + s′ ≡ 0 (mod k) .

The congruences

                    m (s +2)+1 ≡ 0 (mod k) , m′ (s′ +2)+1 ≡ 0 (mod k)

are the congruences

                    ms+2m+1 ≡ 0 (mod k) , m′ s′ +2m′ +1 ≡ 0 (mod k) .                       (A)

The conditions gcd (s, k) = 1 and gcd (s′ , k) = 1 imply the congruences

                mss′ +2ms′ +s′ ≡ 0 (mod k) , m′ s′ s +2m′s+s ≡ 0 (mod k) .                  (B)

Moreover, m+m′ = k−1 implies m+m′ ≡ −1 (mod k), and hence

                                       m′ ≡ −m−1 (mod k) .

From (A) we then obtain

            ms+2m+1 ≡ 0 (mod k) , (−m−1) s′ +2 (−m−1)+1 ≡ 0 (mod k) ,

and hence
                                      m (s−s′) ≡ s′ (mod k) .                               (C)
From (B) we obtain

         mss′ +2ms′ +s′ ≡ 0 (mod k) , (−m−1) ss′ +2 (−m−1) s+s ≡ 0 (mod k) ,

and hence
                               ss′ +s−s′ +2m (s−s′) ≡ 0 (mod k) .                           (D)
Combining (C) and (D) we get the required congruence

                                     ss′ + s + s′ ≡ 0 (mod k) .

Further, i ≡ 1+j (i) (mod k) and i−1 ≡ 1+j (i−1) (mod k) imply

                                  (j (i)−j (i−1)) s ≡ 1 (mod k) .

Since gcd (s′ , k) = 1, this is equivalent to

                                 (j (i)−j (i−1)) ss′ ≡ s′ (mod k) .

Applying ss′ + s + s′ ≡ 0 (mod k), we then get

                             (j (i)−j (i−1)) ss′ ≡ −ss′ −s (mod k) .

Since gcd (s, k) = 1, this implies that
                                 (j (i)−j (i−1)) s′ ≡ −s′ −1 (mod k) .
Finally, t (i) ≡ 1+j (i) s′ (mod k) and t (i−1) ≡ 1+j (i−1) s′ (mod k) imply
                             t (i)−t (i−1) ≡ (j (i)−j (i−1)) s′ (mod k) ,
and consequently t (i)−t (i−1) ≡ −s′ −1 (mod k). Therefore, we obtain
                                    t (i−1) ≡ t (i)+s′ +1 (mod k) ,
as required in (i).
    Let i ≡ 1+j (i) (mod k) and i+s+1 ≡ 1+j (i+s+1) (mod k). This implies
                               (j (i)−j (i+s+1)) s ≡ −s−1 (mod k) .
Since gcd (s′ , k) = 1, this is equivalent to
                             (j (i)−j (i+s+1)) ss′ ≡ −ss′ −s′ (mod k) .
Applying ss′ + s + s′ ≡ 0 (mod k), we then get
                                  (j (i)−j (i+s+1)) ss′ ≡ s (mod k) .
Since gcd (s, k) = 1, this implies that
                                  (j (i)−j (i+s+1)) s′ ≡ 1 (mod k) .
Finally, t (i) ≡ 1+j (i) s′ (mod k) and t (i+s+1) ≡ 1+j (i+s+1) s′ (mod k) imply
                         t (i)−t (i+s+1) ≡ (j (i)−j (i+s+1)) s′ (mod k) ,
and consequently t (i)−t (i+s+1) ≡ 1 (mod k). Therefore, we obtain
                                     t (i+s+1) ≡ t (i)−1 (mod k) ,
as required in (iii).
    We note that fs,s′,k ◦ fs′ ,s,k = idΛ(p′ ,q′,k′ ,s′,θ′ ) and fs′ ,s,k ◦ fs,s′,k = idΛ(p,q,k,s,θ). Hence the
algebras Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Λ (p′ , q ′, k ′ , s′ , θ′ ) are isomorphic.
   We do not know yet if two algebras of the forms Λ (p, q, k, s, θ) and Λ (p′ , q ′ , k ′ , s′ , θ′ )
are stably equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic.
   We ends this section with two examples illustrating the above considerations.
Example 10.3. Let k = 8. Then the set of all s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 7} satisfying gcd (s, 8) = 1
and gcd (s+2, 8) = 1 consists of 1, 3, 5 and 7. Moreover, we have m8,1 = 5, m8,3 = 3,
m8,5 = 1, m8,7 = 7. Observe that for any s, s′ ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7} we have m8,s +m8,s′ 6= k−1 = 7.
Therefore, for any p, q, p′, q ′ > 0, s, s′ ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7} with s 6= s′ and θ ∈ K\ {0}, we have
Λ (p, q, 8, s, θ) ≇ Λ (p′ , q ′ , 8, s′, θ).
Example 10.4. Let k = 5, s = 1 and s′ = 2. Then gcd (s, k) = 1, gcd (s+2, k) = 1,
gcd (s′ , k) = 1, gcd (s′ +2, k) = 1. Moreover, m5,1 = 3, m5,2 = 1, and so m5,1 +m5,2 = 4 =
k−1. Hence, for any p, q, p′ , q ′ > 0 and θ ∈ K\ {0}, we have Λ (p, q, 5, 1, θ) ∼
                                                                                 = Λ (p′ , q ′ , 5, 2, θ).

11. Proof of Theorem 2

    As a consequence of our main theorem we deduce in this section some results on ho-
mological invariants of one-parametric selﬁnjective algebras.
    Recall that the representation dimension of an algebra A was deﬁned by Auslander [4]
as the number

               repdim(A) := inf{gldim EndA (N) | N generator-cogenerator}.

A ﬁnitely generated A-module N is a generator-cogenerator for A if it contains all projective
indecomposable and all injective indecomposable A-modules as direct summands. This
invariant gives a way of measuring how far an algebra is from being of ﬁnite representation
type. In fact, repdim(A) ≤ 2 if and only if A is of ﬁnite representation type [4].
    We shall prove the following result which contributes further to the long-term project
of determining the representation dimension for all (selﬁnjective) algebras of tame repre-
sentation type.

Theorem 11.1. Let A be a standard one-parametric selfinjective algebra. Then A has
representation dimension 3.

Proof. We shall use the main results of [16]. Firstly, if an algebra A can be embedded
into an algebra B, preserving radicals, and if B is of ﬁnite representation type, then A
has representation dimension at most 3 ([16, Theorem 1.1]). As an application, we get
secondly that every special biserial algebra has representation dimension at most 3 ([16,
(1.3)]). We also use that for selﬁnjective algebras, the representation dimension is invariant
under derived equivalences [38].
    For A weakly symmetric, the theorem is proved in our paper [8]. Therefore, it suﬃces
to prove the theorem for the normal forms of our derived equivalence classiﬁcation for
standard one-parametric selﬁnjective algebras obtained in this paper.
    The normal forms Λ(p, q, k, s, θ) are special biserial, hence they have representation
dimension at most 3. Since they are not of ﬁnite representation type, the representation
dimension is actually 3. The normal forms Γ∗ (n) are not special biserial. In order to show
that repdim (Γ∗ (n)) = 3, we shall construct a radical embedding of a certain factor algebra
of Γ∗ (n) into an algebra of ﬁnite representation type. This proof is similar to the one for
algebras of Euclidean type carried out in [8]. Since this paper might not be easily available,
we include a complete proof here for the convenience of the reader.
    Suitable factor algebras for determining representation dimensions are suggested by the
following useful result ([16, (1.2)]): Let A be a basic algebra, and let P be an indecomposable
projective-injective A-module. Consider the factor algebra B := A/soc(P ) modulo the socle
of P . If repdim (B) ≤ 3, then also repdim (A) ≤ 3.
    We now consider the algebras Γ∗ (n). Let v be the unique vertex of the quiver of Γ∗ (n)
with three incoming and outgoing arrows, with corresponding projective indecomposable
module P (v). We consider the factor algebra Γ     e∗ (n) := Γ∗ (n)/ soc (Pv ). We get additional
44                               R. Bocian, T. Holm and A. Skowroński


relations α1 α2 = 0, γ1 γ2 = 0 and (β1 . . . βn )2 = 0. We have to show that Γ                 e∗ (n) has
representation dimension 3.
    In order to construct a radical embedding of Γ           e∗ (n) into an algebra of ﬁnite representa-
tion type we use the technique of splitting datum as introduced in [16]. We can distribute
the edges adjacent to v as follows: E1 ∪E2 := {βn }∪{α2 , γ2 } and S1 ∪S2 := {β1 }∪{α1 , γ1 }.
The conditions for a splitting datum are satisﬁed: all products in Ei Sj are zero for i 6= j
and all relations of Γ      e∗ (n) are monomial. Any splitting datum gives rise to a radical em-
bedding into an algebra whose quiver is obtained by splitting the vertex under considera-
tion. In our case, we get a radical embedding of Γ            e∗ (n) into the algebra Γe∗ (n)sp given by
the disjoint union of a cyclic quiver with edges β1 , . . . , βn and relations (β1 . . . βn )2 = 0,
βj βj+1 . . . βn β1 . . . βn β1 . . . βj−1βj = 0, for 2 ≤ j ≤ n, and the quiver
                                             α2 ✲         γ1 ✲
                                         ✛           ✛
                                             α1           γ2

with relations α1 α2 = 0, γ1 γ2 = 0, α2 γ1 = 0, γ2 α1 = 0. Note that this new algebra Γ e∗ (n)sp
is special biserial and of ﬁnite representation type [36].
    By the radical embedding theorem from [16] we can deduce that Γ     e ∗ (n) has representa-
tion dimension 3, as desired.


    For selﬁnjective algebras, the representation dimension is intimately related to the
notion of the dimension of a triangulated category as recently deﬁned by R. Rouquier [34].
Let us brieﬂy recall the main deﬁnitions. Let A be a selﬁnjective algebra with stable module
category mod A of ﬁnitely generated A-modules. Recall that this is a triangulated category
with shift Ω−1 (see [20]). For any A-module M denote by hMii the full subcategory of
mod A with objects the direct summands of the modules obtained from M by taking i-fold
extensions of ﬁnite direct sums of shifts. Then following R. Rouquier [34], the dimension
of mod A, denoted dim mod A, is the minimal integer d ≥ 0 such that there is an A-module
M with mod A = hMid+1 . In particular, we have dim mod A = 0 if and only if A has ﬁnite
representation type. As with the representation dimension, it seems to be very hard to
determine this dimension of the stable module category, even for examples of fairly small
and well-known algebras.
    The representation dimension of a selﬁnjective algebra is closely related to the dimension
of its stable module category, as observed by R. Rouquier.
Proposition 11.2. Let A be a selfinjective algebra. Then repdim(A) ≥ 2 + dim mod A.

Proof. See [34, Proposition 6.9].

   Using this connection we can deduce the dimension of the stable module category of
standard selﬁnjective one-parametric algebras from our Theorem 11.1.
Corollary 11.3. Let A be a standard one-parametric selfinjective algebra. Then the stable
module category mod A has dimension 1.

   It does not seem to be clear how one can determine the dimensions of stable module
categories directly, without referring to the representation dimension.
   The following problem would be interesting to consider.
Question 1: Is dim mod A ≤ 1 for all (selﬁnjective) algebras of tame representation type?

   This is a weaker version of the following long standing open problem.
Question 2: Is repdim(A) ≤ 3 for all (selﬁnjective) algebras of tame representation type?

   Note that the only known examples of algebras of representation dimension greater 3
were only recently discovered by Rouquier [34], and they are all of wild representation type.
