                                                     Abstract. Let C be a connected noetherian hereditary abelian Ext-finite cat-
                                                     egory with Serre functor over an algebraically closed field k, with finite dimen-
                                                     sional homomorphism and extension spaces. Using the classification of such
                                                     categories from [31], we prove that if C has some object of infinite length, then
                                                     the Grothendieck group of C is finitely generated if and only if C has a tilting
                                                     object.



                                                                                   Introduction
                                                Let k be an algebraically closed field and C a hereditary abelian Ext-finite k-
                                             category. That C is hereditary means that Exti (−, −) vanishes for i ≥ 2, and we
                                             say that C is Ext-finite if Exti (A, B) is finite dimensional over k for all A, B in C
                                             and all i. A central problem in the representation theory of artin algebras is to
                                             describe such C which have a tilting object. This is important in connection with
                                             the investigation of quasitilted algebras, as introduced in [19].
                                                When a hereditary abelian Ext-finite k-category C has a tilting object, it is a
                                             consequence that the Grothendieck group K0 (C) is free abelian of finite rank [19].
                                             This suggests the problem of describing the C for which K0 (C) is finitely gener-
                                             ated (or free abelian of finite rank), and to decide to which extent having a finitely
                                             generated Grothendieck group implies the existence of a tilting object. Relating
                                             the existence of a tilting object to properties of the more widely known notion of
                                             Grothendieck group provides a better insight into the meaning of the condition
                                             of the existence of a tilting object. In particular, it is interesting to understand
                                             in terms of Grothendieck groups the special role the category coh X of coherent
                                             sheaves on a weighted projective line [12] plays within the larger class of quotient
                                             categories of finitely generated graded modules over commutative noetherian iso-
                                             lated singularities of Krull dimension two.
                                                We will use the general classification results from [31] to solve the above prob-
                                             lems under the additional hypotheses that C is noetherian and has a Serre functor
                                             (see section 1). The latter hypothesis is natural since it is a consequence of the
                                             existence of a tilting object. Both additional hypotheses are satisfied for the quo-
                                             tient categories mentioned above. Since the properties of C having a tilting object,
                                             a finitely generated Grothendieck group or a Serre functor are preserved under de-

to the C with the additional hypothesis of having a Serre functor and being derived
equivalent to a noetherian hereditary category.
   Some of the results on Grothendieck groups of quotient categories proved in this
paper are inspired by similar results for two-dimensional complete noetherian rings,
used as a tool for classifying maximal orders of finite representation type in [30].
   Section 1 is devoted to discussing background material from various sources,
collected together for the benefit of the reader. In section 2 we describe the C with
finitely generated Grothendieck group. A new criterion for an object to be a tilting
object is given in section 3, which it is interesting also in its own right. In section
4 we construct exceptional collections of modules over a hereditary order over a
discrete valuation ring. This is used in section 5, along with the criterion from
section 3, to construct a tilting object in the category coh O of coherent modules
over a sheaf O of hereditary orders over P1 . In section 6 we give our main result
on the connection between the existence of a tilting object and the Grothendieck
group being finitely generated. Under our assumptions the conditions turn out to
be equivalent if C is connected and has some object of infinite length. In section 7
we give some examples and comments.
   We give an appendix proving directly the relationship between the category of
coherent sheaves on a weighted projective line and the above mentioned category
coh O.
   Hereditary abelian k-categories which are Ext-finite, noetherian and have a Serre
functor were classified in [31]. It is also of interest to investigate hereditary abelian
categories which do not satisfy the additional assumptions, for example with respect
to when the Grothendieck group is finitely generated. In Appendix B we give some
sources of examples of hereditary abelian categories.

                                   1. Background
   In this section we provide some background material from various sources, to
provide a better understanding of how our work fits in.
1.1. Tilting objects. Let A be a triangulated category with the property that
between two objects only a finite number of Ext are non-zero. If T ∈ A, then add(T)
is by definition the smallest additive category containing T which is closed under
finite direct sums and summands. We say that T is a tilting object if ExtiA (T, T ) = 0
for i 6= 0 and add T generates A (in the sense that A is the smallest subcategory
of A containing add T which is closed under shifts and cones).
   If C is an abelian category of finite homological dimension then T ∈ C is a tilting
object if it is a tilting object in Db (C). This definition of a tilting object in C
is equivalent to the usual notion of tilting module (of finite projective dimension)
when C is the category mod Λ of finitely generated modules for an artin algebra
of finite global dimension, as is seen directly or by using [9, 32]. For an Ext-finite
hereditary abelian k-category C it is equivalent to the following definition used in
[18] (reformulating conditions from [19, 16]): An object T in C is a tilting object
if Ext1 (T, T ) = 0 and if Hom(T, X) = 0 = Ext1 (T, X) implies X = 0. In general
the definition in [19] is modelled on the definition of a tilting module of projective
dimension at most one, and is hence different from ours when C is not hereditary.
   When T is a tilting object in mod Λ for an artin algebra Λ of finite global dimen-
sion, there is an induced equivalence Db (mod Λ) → Db (mod End(T )opp ) between
bounded derived categories, and similarly if T is a tilting object in the category
coh X of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety X [15, 32, 3]. This can
easily be extended to the case of coh O where O is a coherent OX -algebra locally
of finite global dimension. The analogous result for tilting objects in Ext-finite
hereditary abelian k-categories is given in [19].
                   GROTHENDIECK GROUPS AND TILTING OBJECTS                                3


   In general if T is a tilting object in a triangulated category A one may expect an
equivalence A ∼   = Db (End(T )opp ). There is recent work in this direction by Keller,
using A∞ -categories, and building on [21]. In particular it follows from his results
that if T is a tilting object in an Ext-finite abelian k-category C of finite homological
dimension, then there is an equivalence between Db (C) and Db (End(T )opp ).
   It follows from this derived equivalence that when C is an Ext-finite abelian k-
category of finite homological dimension having a tilting object T , the Grothendieck
group Ko (C) is isomorphic to Zn , where n is the number of nonisomorphic sum-
mands of T (see [19] for the hereditary case). Given T in C with Exti (T, T ) = 0 for
i > 0, it is an important problem, open even for artin algebras, whether T having
n nonisomorphic summands is sufficient for T to be a tilting object. It is known
in the case of artin algebras when the projective dimension of T is at most one [6],
and for C Ext-finite hereditary if C has some tilting object [16].

1.2. Hereditary categories and weighted projective lines. Hereditary abelian
Ext-finite categories are of special interest in connection with quasitilted algebras,
as introduced in [19]. The quasitilted algebras are by definition the endomorphism
algebras End(T )opp when T is a tilting object in a hereditary category. Equivalently,
an algebra Λ is quasitilted if and only if gl.dim.Λ ≤ 2 and each indecomposable X
in mod Λ has projective or injective dimension at most one [19]. Main examples
of categories C are mod Λ where Λ is a hereditary artin algebra and coh X when
X is a smooth projective curve. More generally there are the coherent sheaves on
weighted projective lines [12], which we discuss next.
   Let λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λn ), n ≥ 2, be a finite number of points in P1 , with λ1 = 0,
λ2 = ∞, λ3 = 1. For a sequence e = (e1 , . . . , en ) of positive integers consider the
associated ring
(1.1)                 R = k[x1 , . . . , xn ]/[(xei i − xe22 + λi xe11 )]i≥3 .
Let H be the abelian group generated by h1 , . . . , hn and with relations e1 h1 =
· · · = en hn . Then H is isomorphic to Z ⊕ G, where G is a finite group [12]. R
is then a H-graded ring, and Geigle and Lenzing write coh X for the hereditary
category grH R/finite length, where grH R denotes the category of finitely gener-
ated H-graded R-modules with degree zero homomorphisms. Geometrically coh X
can be viewed as the coherent sheaves over a (hypothetical) space X which is a
generalization of P1 . Hence Geigle and Lenzing call X a “weighted projective line”.
     The category coh X is a noetherian hereditary abelian category with finite di-
mensional homomorphism and extension spaces, which has a tilting object T such
that EndH (T )opp is a canonical algebra in the sense of Ringel [33], and actu-
ally all canonical algebras are obtained this way. Like for tilting for finite di-
mensional algebras [15], there is also induced an equivalence of derived categories
Db (coh X ) → Db ( EndH (T )opp ) [12]. This setup is used to give an alternative
approach to the study of the module theory for canonical algebras, by first inves-
tigating the hereditary category coh X . The rings described by (1.1) are H-graded
factorial and it is shown in [22] that this property characterizes those rings amongst
the two-dimensional rings.
     There are two main known sources of connected hereditary categories C with
tilting object; the module categories of finite dimensional hereditary k-algebras
and the categories coh X . In addition there are the hereditary abelian categories
derived equivalent to them. It is conjectured that there are no more, and in fact this
is proved in [25] for noetherian hereditary categories and more generally in [17, 18]
under the assumption that C has at least one nonzero object of finite length, or at
least one directing object, that is, an object which does not lie on a cycle of nonzero
nonisomorphisms.

1.3. Noetherian hereditary categories with Serre functor. We recall some
essential features of the classification of noetherian hereditary abelian Ext-finite
k-categories with Serre functor. For further details we refer to [31].
    Assume that C is Ext-finite. A Serre functor for C is an auto-equivalence F :
Db (C) → Db (C) where Db (C) denotes the bounded derived category, such that there
                                   ∼
                                   =
are isomorphisms Hom(A, B) −→ Hom(B, F A)∗ natural in A and B ((−)∗ is the
k-dual). This clearly implies that C has finite homological dimension.
    For a hereditary abelian Ext-finite k-category C the existence of a Serre functor
implies the existence of almost split sequences, and the converse holds if C has no
non-zero projective or injective objects [31].
    Let be C a connected category. It is proved in [31] that if C is a connected
noetherian hereditary Ext-finite k-category with Serre functor then C has one of
the following forms.
   (i) A category coh O, where O is a sheaf of hereditary orders over a smooth
       projective curve.
  (ii) C is mod Λ for a finite dimensional hereditary k-algebra Λ.
 (iii) C is the category of finite dimensional representations of the quiver Ãn with
       cyclic orientation with n < ∞.
 (iv) C is derived equivalent to a hereditary category where all objects have finite
       length and having an infinite number of nonisomorphic simple objects.
The actual result in [31] also contains a precise classification of the categories in
(iv). We also recall from [31] that for the categories in (i) there is an alternative
description as follows.
  (i’) Categories of the form qgr S = gr S/finite length, where gr S denotes the
       category of finitely generated graded modules over a commutative noetherian
       Z-graded domain S = k + S1 + S2 + ... + Si + ... of Krull dimension two which
       is finite over its center, where the Si are finite dimensional over k, and S is
       an isolated singularity.
    The categories coh X have also as we have seen a similar description, as quotient
categories starting with an H-graded ring, where H is not necessarily Z. But it
follows from [13][24] that one can assume that the rings are Z-graded, so that the
class coh X is a subclass of the qgr S.
1.4. Classical hereditary orders. In this section we collect some well-known
properties of hereditary orders. We will loosely refer to a classical hereditary order
as an order Λ in a central simple algebra A over a field K which is hereditary. Let
R be the center of Λ. According to [34] R is a Dedekind ring. (This fact does not
seem to be contained in exactly this form in [29]).
   Assume that R is a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal m. Then according
to [29] the radical I of Λ is invertible. Furthermore by [29] there is an integer e such
that I e = mΛ, called the ramification index of Λ/R. It follows from the structure
theory of hereditary orders in [29] that if e = 1 then Λ is maximal. If the converse is
true then we say that A/K is unramified. This happens for example if A = Mn (K).
   If R is not a discrete valuation ring then by localizing one defines ramification
indices eP for the non-zero primes in R. By analyzing D = Hom(Λ, R) it follows
easily that Λ/R ramifies in only a finite number of primes.

                2. Finitely generated Grothendieck groups
   Let C be a noetherian Ext-finite hereditary abelian k-category with Serre functor,
where k is an arbitrary field. In this section we describe which C have finitely
generated Grothendieck group. For this we use the classification theorem from
[31] in the form recalled in §1.3. The main problem we need to deal with is when
                   GROTHENDIECK GROUPS AND TILTING OBJECTS                            5


the category coh O of coherent modules over a sheaf O of hereditary orders over a
smooth projective curve X has finitely generated Grothendieck group.
   Let X be a regular connected curve over a field k. Let K be the function field
of X and let A be a central simple algebra over K. Let O be a sheaf of hereditary
orders in A over OX . Thus locally O is a hereditary order over a Dedekind ring (in
the sense of [29]).
   If A is a sheaf of rings on a topological space Z then we use the notation coh(A)
for the category of coherent A-modules and we write K0 (A) for K0 (coh(A)).
   Our first aim is to give some results on K0 (O).
Proposition 2.1. Let O be as above. Let x1 , . . . , xt be the points in which O
ramifies, and let e1 , . . . , et be the corresponding ramification indices (see §1.4).
   Put
                                             X
(2.1)                                   r=      (ei − 1).
                                         i

Let Ō be a maximal order lying over O. Then
                              K0 (O) ∼
                                     = K0 (Ō) ⊕ Zr .
If k is algebraically closed then
                               K0 (O) ∼
                                      = K0 (OX ) ⊕ Zr .
Proof. The hereditary orders in A containing O form a partially ordered set which
we will denote by H(O).
   If O′ ∈ H(O) lies minimally over O then one proves exactly as in [30, Thm 1.14]
that K0 (O) = K0 (O′ ) ⊕ Z.
   Let Ō be a maximal order lying over O. We deduce that K0 (O) ∼ = Zr ⊕ K0 (Ō),
where r is the length of a maximal chain in H(O), starting in O and ending in Ō.
   A local computation shows that r is given by the formula (2.1), which finishes
the proof of the computation of K0 (O).
   If k is algebraically closed then by Tsen’s theorem [8, p. 374] one has that
Ō ∼
   = EndOX (E) where E is a vector bundle of rank n on X. Hence by Morita
theory K0 (Ō) ∼
               = K0 (OX ).

Corollary 2.2. Assume k is a algebraically closed. Then K0 (O) is finitely gener-
ated if and only if X is an open subset of P1 .
Proof. By the previous proposition it suffices to prove this for O = OX . Let X̄ be
the regular projective curve associated to the function field of X [10]. Then X̄ is
a regular compactification of X. In particular X̄ − X is a finite number of points,
whence by the localization sequence K0 (OX ) is finitely generated if and only if
K0 (OX̄ ) is finitely generated. Hence we may assume that X is projective. By [20,
Ex. II.6.12, Rem. IV.4.10.4] one has K0 (OX ) ∼= Z2 ⊕ J(k) where J(k) denotes the
k-points of the Jacobian of X. It is well-known that J(k) is not finitely generated if
X ≇ P1 (for example because in that case J(k) is non-trivial and divisible [26]).
  Combining with §1.3 we now get the following main result of this section.
Theorem 2.3. Let C be a connected noetherian Ext-finite hereditary abelian k-
category with Serre functor where k is an algebraically closed field. Then Ko (C) is
finitely generated (free abelian) if and only if C has one of the following forms.
   1. mod Λ where Λ is an indecomposable finite dimensional hereditary k-algebra.
   2. Finite dimensional representations over Ãn with n finite and cyclic orienta-
       tion.
   3. coh O where O is a sheaf of hereditary OX -orders with X = P1 .
6                         I. REITEN AND M. VAN DEN BERGH


Proof. It is clear that the categories in 1. and 2. have finitely generated (free
abelian) Grothendieck groups, and that Ko (C) is not finitely generated if C is derived
equivalent to a hereditary category C ′ with all objects of finite length and an infinite
number of nonisomorphic simple objects. In view of §1.3 the proof is completed by
using Corollary 2.2.

        3. A criterion for deciding if an object is a tilting object.
   The aim of this section is to give a criterion for an object of projective dimension
at most one in an abelian category to be a tilting object. For this we need to recall
some results on semiorthogonal pairs in triangulated categories from [4, 5].
   Let A be a triangulated category and let B, C be two strict (= closed under
isomorphisms) full triangulated subcategories of A. (B, C) is said to be a semi-
orthogonal pair if HomA (B, C) = 0 for B ∈ B and C ∈ C. Define
                     B ⊥ = {A ∈ A | ∀B ∈ B : HomA (B, A) = 0}
⊥
  C is defined similarly.
   If S is a class of objects in A then the (triangulated) category generated by S is
the smallest subcategory of A which is closed under shifts, cones, and isomorphisms.
   The following result is a slight variation of the statement of [4, Lemma 3.3.1]
(see also [5, §1]).
Lemma 3.1. The following conditions are equivalent for a semi-orthogonal pair
(B, C).
  1. B and C generate A.
  2. For every A ∈ A there exists a distinguished triangle B → A → C with B ∈ B
      and C ∈ C.
  3. C = B ⊥ and the inclusion functor i∗ : B → A has a right adjoint i! : A → B.
  4. B = ⊥ C and the inclusion functor j∗ : C → A has a left adjoint j ∗ : A → C.
If one of these conditions holds then the functors i! , j ∗ are exact and the triangles
in 2. are (for a fixed A) unique up to unique isomorphism. They are necessarily of
the form
(3.1)                             i∗ i! A → A → j∗ j ∗ A
where the maps are obtained by adjointness from the identity maps i! A → i! A and
j ∗ A → j ∗ A. In particular triangles as in 2. are functorial.
    If any of the conditions of the previous lemma holds then we say that (B, C) is a
semi-orthogonal decomposition of A.
    Now for the rest of this section let k be a field. All categories (abelian or
triangulated) will be k-linear and have finite dimensional Hom’s and Ext’s. We
assume furthermore that for any pair A, B, there are only a finite number of non-
zero Exti (A, B).
    Let A be a triangulated or abelian category. For an object T in A we denote by
T ⊥ the full subcategory of A whose objects are the C in A with Exti (T, C) = 0
for all i. We say that an object T ∈ A is exceptional if ExtiA (T, T ) = 0 for i > 0
and EndA (T ) is a (finite dimensional) division algebra. A sequence of exceptional
objects T1 , . . . , Tn is an exceptional collection if Ext∗A (Ti , Tj ) = 0 for j > i. An
exceptional collection is strongly exceptional if ExttA (Ti , Tj ) = 0 for t > 0 and all
i, j.
    The following is proved in [5].
Lemma 3.2. Assume that T1 , . . . , Tn is an exceptional collection in a triangulated
category A. Let B be the triangulated subcategory of A generated by T1 , . . . , Tn and

put T = ⊕i Ti . Then A has a semi-orthogonal decomposition given by (B, B ⊥) =
(B, T ⊥).
Proof. For the convenience of the reader we repeat the proof. We have to show
that A is generated by B and T ⊥ . Let B1 be the full subcategory of A consisting of
objects isomorphic to finite direct sums of the form ⊕j T1 [j]aj . Then B1 is a strict
triangulated subcategory of A. This can be deduced from the fact that the forma-
tion of triangles in A is compatible with direct sums [37, Cor. II.1.2.5]. Sending
A ∈ A to ⊕i Exti (T1 , A) ⊗D T1 [−i] defines a right adjoint to the inclusion B1 ֒→ A.
This yields a semi-orthogonal decomposition of A given by (B1 , B1⊥ ) = (B1 , T1⊥ ).
In particular A is generated by B1 and T1⊥ . Now we repeat this construction with
T2 ∈ T1⊥ . So if B2 is the full subcategory of A consisting of objects isomorphic to
finite direct sums of the form ⊕j T2 [j]aj then we have that T1⊥ is generated by B2
and (T1 ⊕ T2 )⊥ . Continuing this procedure we find that A is generated by B1 , . . . Bn
and T ⊥ . This finishes the proof.
  We point out the following consequence of Lemma 3.2.
Corollary 3.3. Let T1 , · · · , Tn be a strongly exceptional collection in a triangulated
category A satisfying the above assumptions. Then T is a tilting object if and only
if T ⊥ = 0.
   We shall need that semi-orthogonal decompositions behave nicely with respect
to Grothendieck groups.
Lemma 3.4. Assume that (B, C) is a semi-orthogonal decomposition for a trian-
gulated category A. Then K0 (A) ∼
                                = K0 (B) ⊕ K0 (C).
Proof. The inclusions B, C ⊂ A define a map K0 (B) ⊕ K0 (C) → K0 (A). An inverse
to this map is given by sending [A] to [i! A]⊕[j ∗ A] (see Lemma 3.1 for notations).

Lemma 3.5. Assume that A is a triangulated category, and let T1 , . . . , Tn ∈ A be
an exceptional collection. Put T = ⊕i Ti . Then K0 (A) ∼
                                                       = Zn ⊕ K0 (T ⊥ ).
Proof. Using the same method as in Lemma 3.2 we find inductively using Lemma
   that K0 (A) = ⊕i K0 (Bi ) ⊕ K0 (T ⊥ ). Now it is easy to see that sending ⊕j Ti [j]aj
3.4P
to j (−1)j aj defines an isomorphism K0 (Bi ) ∼ = Z. This proves what we want.
   If B is an abelian category and B ∈ B then we will say that B has projective
dimension ≤ r if ExtsB (B, −) = 0 for s > r.
   The above results have a counterpart for abelian categories provided we work
with exceptional objects of projective dimension ≤ 1. This follows from the follow-
ing lemma.
Lemma 3.6. Assume that B is an abelian category and let T be an object in B of
projective dimension ≤ 1. If an object in Db (B) is (right) perpendicular to T then
                                               ⊥
so is its homology. In particular DTb ⊥ (B) = TD b (B) .
                                      B
                   ⊥                                              n
Proof. Let B ∈ TD   b (B) and assume that n is maximal such that H (B) 6= 0. Then

there is a triangle
(3.2)                       τ<n B → B → H n (B)[−n] →
Applying Hom(T, −) yields injections Exti (T, H n (B)) ֒→ Hom(T, (τ<n B)[n+1+i]).
Since for i ≥ 0 the non-trivial homology of (τ<n B)[n + 1 + i] occurs in degrees ≤ −2
and since the projective dimension of T is less than or equal to 1 it follows that
Hom(T, (τ<n B)[n + 1 + i]) = 0 for i ≥ 0. In particular Exti (T, H n (B)) = 0 for
i ≥ 0. Since trivially Exti (T, H n (B)) = 0 for i < 0 it follows that H n (B) ∈ T ⊥ .
But then it follows from (3.2) that τ<n B ∈ T ⊥ . Repeating this procedure with B
replaced by τ<n B eventually yields that the homology of B is in T ⊥ .

As a corollary one obtains a proof of the following standard result.
Corollary 3.7. Let T and B be as in the previous lemma. Then TB⊥ is an abelian
category.
Proof. If f : A → B is a map in TB⊥ then one has to show that ker f , coker f ∈ TB⊥ .
                                                      ⊥
Since the complex represented by f clearly lies in TD  b (B) , this follows from the

previous lemma.
   As a consequence of Lemma 3.6 we obtain the following result on Grothendieck
groups.
Corollary 3.8. Assume that B is an abelian category. Assume that T1 , . . . , Tn ∈ B
is an exceptional collection consisting of objects of projective dimension ≤ 1. Let
T = ⊕i Ti . Then K0 (B) ∼= Zn ⊕ K0 (T ⊥ ).
Proof. By Lemmas 3.5 and 3.6 one has
                        K0 (B) ∼
                               = K0 (Db (B))
                                      ∼           ⊥
                                      = Zn ⊕ K0 (TD b (B) )

                                      ∼
                                      = Zn ⊕ K0 (Db ⊥ (B))
                                                     TB
                                      ∼
                                      = Zn ⊕ K0 (TB⊥ )
    We now get the main result of this section.
Corollary 3.9. Assume that B is an abelian category of finite Krull dimension.
Let T = ⊕ni=1 Ti be as in Corollary 3.8, but assume is addition that Ext1 (Ti , Tj ) = 0
for all i, j. If n = rk K0 (B) then T is a tilting object in B.
Proof. By Lemma 3.2 we have to show T ⊥ = 0. By Lemma 3.6 it follows that T ⊥
                                                          def
is equal to DTb ⊥ (B). So it is sufficient to show that H = TB⊥ = 0.
                 B
    By Corollary 3.8 one has rk K0 (H) = 0. Since H is an abelian subcategory of B,
it also has finite Krull dimension. In particular if H =6 0 there is a quotient category
C of H which has finite length. Selecting a simple object in C yields a rank function
on H which is non-trivial. Hence rk K0 (H) > 0. This yields a contradiction.
   It would be interesting to know if for a nonzero hereditary abelian k-category B
with finite dimensional homomorphism and extension spaces we must have K0 (B) 6=
0.

    4. Strongly exceptional collections for hereditary orders over
                         discrete valuation rings
   In order to construct a tilting object in the category coh O of coherent modules
for a hereditary order O over P1 we need to produce some exceptional collections of
modules for hereditary orders over discrete valuation rings. We start by recalling
some properties for such orders. For simplicity we restrict ourselves to hereditary
orders contained in a matrix ring since that is the only case we will need.
   Let R be a discrete valuation ring and let m be its maximal ideal. Furthermore
let K be the quotient field of R and put A = Mn (K) . Let ∆ be a hereditary order
in A in the sense of [29].
   Thus there exist strictly positive integers n1 , . . . , nt such that n = n1 + · · · + nt
and such that ∆ is isomorphic to
                                                                

                                               ..                
                         .              .        .              

Here (−)a×b is a shorthand for Ma×b (−). Strictly speaking this is proved in [29]
only in the case that R is complete, but as is remarked in [29, bottom of p. 364]
the result remains valid in the case
                                 P we consider.P
   For i = 1, . . . , t put pi =   j≤i nj , qi =    j>i nj . Also let Pi be the i’th
indecomposable projective for ∆.
   Thus by definition
                                                 
                                           mpi−1
                                   Pi =
                                            Rqi−1
where (−)a now stands for Ma×1 (−).
   Clearly P1 ⊃ P2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Pt . Set Si = P1 /Pi for i = 2, . . . , t and for the same
indexes put define
                                                         
                                 Rpi−1 ×pi−1 mpi−1 ×qi−1
                         ∆i =
                                  Rqi−1 ×pi−1 Rqi−1 ×qi−1
The ∆i are submaximal orders containing ∆ and Si is a simple ∆i -module.
  Using this observation one proves:
Lemma 4.1. One has
                                               (
                                                0            if i > j
                                    ∆i ⊗∆ Sj =
                                                Si           if i ≤ j

Proof. Since one has ∆i ⊗∆ P1 = ∆i ⊗∆ ∆i ⊗∆i P1 = ∆i ⊗∆i P1 = P1 it follows
that
                                       ∆i ⊗∆ Sj = P1 /∆i Pj
It is now easy to see that
                                                 (
                                                     P1    if i > j
                                      ∆i Pj =
                                                     Pi    if i ≤ j

which yields the result.


Corollary 4.2. Ext1∆ (Sj , Si ) = 0, and
                                                     (
                                                          0         if i > j
                                 Hom∆ (Sj , Si ) =
                                                          R/m       if i ≤ j

Proof. One has
                                                                (
                                                                    0                   if i > j
          Extp∆ (Sj , Si )   =   Extp∆i (∆i   ⊗ ∆ Sj , Si ) =
                                                                    Extp∆i (Si , Si )   if i ≤ j

It is easy to see that Hom(Si , Si ) = R/m and one verifies directly that Ext1∆i (Si , Si ) =
0.


Corollary 4.3. (Si )i=2,... ,t is a strongly exceptional collection for ∆.
   One also has
Lemma 4.4. Extp∆ (Sj , P1 ) = 0 for all p.
Proof. Put Γ = Mn (R). Then one has Extp∆ (Sj , P1 ) = ExtpΓ (Γ ⊗∆ Sj , P1 ) = 0

        5. Existence of tilting objects for hereditary orders on P1
    In this section X will be P1 for an algebraically field k. Let K be the function
field of X and let A = Mn (K). Let O be a sheaf of hereditary orders in A. Thus
locally O is a hereditary order over a Dedekind ring (in the sense of [29]).
    To compute global Ext’s in coh(O) below we will use the fact that [14, Prop.
II.5.3]
(5.1)                 RHomO (A, B) = RΓ(X, RHom O (A, B))
together with the fact that RHom O (A, B) can be computed locally. That is, if
x ∈ X then RHom O (A, B)x = RHom(Ax , Bx ).
    Let Ō be a maximal order in A lying over O. By Tsen’s theorem there exists a
vector bundle E of rank n on X such that Ō = End OX (E).
    Fix i and put Ri = OX,xi , ∆i = Oxi . Then ∆i is isomorphic to an order of the
form (4.1) with t = ei . We choose this isomorphism in such a way that it extends
to an isomorphism between Ōxi and Mn (Ri ). Let us write Sij (i = 1, . . . t, j =
2, . . . , ei ) for the finite length ∆i -modules which were denoted by Sj in Section 4.
We consider the Sij as O-modules.
    Since coh OX has a tilting object, for example given by OX ⊕ OX (−1), the same
is true for Ō by Morita theory. We will take T̄ = E ⊕ E(−1) as a tilting object
in coh(Ō). By the choice of the local isomorphisms, Exi will correspond to the
projective ∆-module denoted by P1 in the previous section.
                                L
Proposition 5.1. T = ij Sij ⊕ E ⊕ E(−1) is a tilting object in coh(O).
Proof. Since K0 (OP1 ) ∼
                       = Z2 it follows from Proposition 2.1 that the number of
summands of T is equal to the rank of K0 (O).
    We want to show that the summands of T are a strongly exceptional collection.
To do this we have to compute the Ext∗ (−, −) between the summands of T . We
first compute the RHom’s using Corollary 4.2 and lemma 4.4. The result is as
follows.
                                 Skl      E    E(−1)
                          Sij      ∗      0       0
(5.2)
                           E     Oxk     OX   OX (−1)
                         E(−1) Oxk OX (1)       OX
For the square marked ‘∗’ we have (using Corollary 4.2)
                                    
                                    0
                                           if i 6= k
                  RHom(Sij , Skl ) = 0      if i = k and l > j
                                    
                                       Oxi otherwise
                                    

It now follows immediately from (5.1) that Ext∗ is zero between the summands of
T . For the Hom’s we find:
                                    Skl E E(−1)
                              Sij    ∗    0      0
(5.3)
                               E     k    k      0
                            E(−1) k k 2          k
with the ‘∗’ entry given by
                                       
                                       0
                                             if i 6= k
                      Hom(Sij , Skl ) = 0     if i = k and l > j
                                       
                                        k     otherwise
                                       

So it follows in particular that T is defined by a strongly exceptional collection. We
are now done by Corolllary 3.9.

6. Finitely generated Grothendieck groups and existence of tilting
                              objects.
   In this section we combine our previous results to get our desired connection
between existence of tilting objects and the Grothendieck group being finitely gen-
erated.
   The main result of this paper is the following.
Theorem 6.1. Let C be a connected noetherian hereditary abelian Ext-finite k-
category with Serre functor, where k is an algebraically closed field. Then the fol-
lowing are equivalent.
  (a) Ko (C) is finitely generated.
  (b) (i) C has a tilting object or
      (ii) C is the category of finite dimensional representations of the quiver Ãn
           with cyclic orientation for some n < ∞.
Proof. (b) ⇒ (a). We have already pointed out that (b)(i) implies (a) [19, I.4.6],
and (b)(ii) implies (a) is obvious.
   (a) ⇒ (b). Assume that Ko (C) is finitely generated. If C = mod Λ for a finite
dimensional hereditary k-algebra Λ, then C has a tilting object. If C = coh O where
O is a sheaf of hereditary orders over P1 , it follows from Proposition 5.1 that C has
a tilting object. Hence we are done using Theorem 2.3.
  Actually, the following related result is also of interest.
Theorem 6.2. Let C be a connected noetherian Ext-finite hereditary category which
has no projectives or injectives and which has an object which is not of finite length.
Then the following are equivalent.
  1. C has a tilting object.
  2. C is derived equivalent to a finite dimensional algebra.
  3. C has almost split sequences and K0 (C) is finitely generated.
  4. C is of the form coh(O) where O is a sheaf of hereditary OP1 -orders.
  5. C is of the form coh X for a weighted projective line X .
Proof. 1. ⇒ 2. When C has a tilting object T , it follows from [19, I, Th. 4.6] that
C is derived equivalent to the finite dimensional algebra End(T )opp .
   2. ⇒ 3. Since the hereditary category C is derived equivalent to a finite dimen-
sional algebra Λ, it follows that Λ must have finite global dimension. Hence mod Λ,
and consequently C, has a Serre functor [15]. Then it follows that C has almost
split sequences [31].
   Since K0 (mod Λ) is finitely generated, it follows that Ko (C) is finitely generated
because this property is an invariant of derived equivalence.
   3. ⇒ 4. Since C has almost split sequences and no nonzero projectives or injec-
tives, it follows that C has a Serre functor [31]. Since C has some object of infinite
length, it follows from Theorem 2.3 that C is of the form coh(O) where O is a sheaf
of hereditary OP1 -orders.
   4. ⇒ 1. This follows from Proposition 5.1.
   5. ⇔ 1. That coh X for a weighted projective line X has a tilting object follows
from [12], and 1. ⇒ 5. follows from [25].
In an appendix we give for completeness an independent proof of 4. ⇔ 5, hence
providing a proof of Theorem 6.2 without using [25].

                          7. Examples and comments
   In this section we give some examples and comments without proofs, related to
the material in this paper.

   We start by pointing out how to obtain some concrete examples of categories
qgr S. Translation quivers Z∆, where ∆ is an extended Dynkin diagram occur
as AR-quivers for the graded reflexive modules over invariant rings S = k[X, Y ]G
where G is a finite group and k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero
(see [2] for the definition of AR-quiver). The corresponding mesh category for Z∆
is then a full subcategory of qgr S whose objects have no nonzero summands of
finite length. We obtain a (finite) basis for K0 (qgr S) by considering vertices given
by a ”section”. Actually such a set of vertices corresponds to a tilting object. For
two-dimensional Z-graded rings S ′ of finite (graded) representation type we have
that qgr S ′ is equivalent to some qgr k[X, Y ]G . The rings k[X, Y ] are Gorenstein. It
is however not true for a two-dimensional isolated singularity in general that there
is a commutative Gorenstein ring S with qgr S ′ equivalent to qgr S(see [24]).
   While there is a lot of analogy with the work in [30], we note that there are
also some differences. In the complete case, for the rings Λ of finite representation
type, considered as orders, the rank n of K0 (q(Λ)) gives information on how far
Λ is from being a maximal order (of finite representation type). In this case there
was a chain Λ = Λ1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Λn of orders with Λn maximal and such that there
is no refinement of the chain. Then K0 (q(Λ)) has rank 1, when Λ is a maximal
order, and all commutative Λ of finite type are maximal orders. In the graded case
however, given S with rank qgr(S) = n, there is no corresponding chain of graded
orders ending up with k[X, Y ].
   We point out that if C is a hereditary abelian k-category with all objects of finite
length, then C does not necessarily have almost split sequences (or Serre functor).
For example, this is the case if C is the category of holonomic modules over the first
Weyl algebra (see [28]). And it follows from [35] that it holds for the category of
finite dimensional representations over k of a finite connected quiver having oriented
cycles, but which is not equal to a single oriented cycle.

     Appendix A. Hereditary orders and weighted projective lines
   In this appendix we will show directly that coh(O) for O a classical hereditary
order over P1 is equivalent to coh X for a weighted projective line X and furthermore
we will show that every weighted projective line appears in this way. As was said
before this can be deduced from Theorem 6.2 together with [25].
   We follows the methods of [1], except that we consider gradings by rank one
abelian groups which can have torsion.
   To formalize this let D be an abelian category and let O ∈ D be an object. In
addition let (th )h∈H be a family of autoequivalences of D indexed by a group H
and for any pair h1 , h2 ∈ H assume there are given natural isomorphisms ηh1 ,h2 :
th1 th2 → th1 h2 satisfying the cocycle condition
(A.1)                ηh1 h2 ,h3 (ηh1 ,h2 · th3 ) = (th1 · ηh2 ,h3 )ηh1 ,h2 h3
The data (th ), (ηh1 ,h2 ) can be used to put a H-graded ring structure on
                                        M
                               Γ∗ (O) =     Hom(th−1 O, O)
                                          h∈H
                          ∗
as well as a H-graded Γ (O)-module structure on
                                   M
                         Γ∗ (M ) =    Hom(th−1 O, M )
                                          h∈H

¿¿From now on we will assume that H is a finitely generated abelian group of rank
one. We fix an element z in H. Associated to H there is a surjective map φ : H → Z,
unique up to sign. We fix the sign by imposing φ(z) > 0. If U is a H-graded abelian
group then we say that U has right bounded grading if Uh = 0 for φ(h) ≫ 0. If R is
                     GROTHENDIECK GROUPS AND TILTING OBJECTS                              13


a noetherian H-graded ring then we define qgr(R) = gr(R)/ tors(R) where tors(R)
consists of the right bounded modules.
   The following result is an easy extension of [1, Thm 4.5].
Proposition A.1. Let D be a noetherian Ext-finite abelian category and let O ∈ D.
Let (th )h∈H be a system of autoequivalences as above and assume that (D, O, tz ) is
an ample triple in the sense of [1]. Then R = Γ∗ (O) is noetherian and the functor
Γ∗ defines an equivalence between D and qgr(R).
    Now let X = P1 , K = k(X) and let O be a sheaf of hereditary OX -orders in
A = Mn (K).
    Let x1 , . . . , xt ∈ X be the set of ramification points of O. Since the analysis of
the cases t = 0, t = 1 and t ≥ 2 is somewhat different we consider the case t ≥ 2
first. Afterwards we discuss the other cases. Fix an arbitrary point x in X distinct
from x1 , . . . , xt and let (fi )i=1,... ,t be rational functions with divisor −(xi ) + (x).
    Let Ii be fractional O-ideals in A defined by the condition
                                        (
                                            (rad Oxi )−1 if y = xi
                              (Ii )y =
                                            Oy             otherwise
¿¿From this definition we obtain canonical isomorphisms (as fractional ideals)
                                               e
(A.2)                              Iiei → Ij j : x → xfj /fi
We let H be the abelian group of rank one generated by the elements h1 , . . . , ht ,
subject to the relations ei hi = ej hj and we put z = h1 + · · · + ht .
   Every h ∈ H has a unique representation of the form a1 h1 + · · · + at ht with
0 ≤ ai < ei for i > 1. We define Ih = I1a1 · · · Itat . From (A.2) we obtain canonical
isomorphisms ζh1 ,h2 : Ih1 Ih2 → Ih1 +h2 .
   Associated to the fractional ideals Ih there are autoequivalences th on coh(O)
given by Ih ⊗ −. The ζh1 ,h2 define natural isomorphisms ηh1 ,h2 : th1 th2 → th1 +h2
satisfying the cocycle condition (A.1).
   Now let Ō be a maximal order overlying O. As usual Ō = End (E) for some
vector bundle E on X. It follows from [31, Ch IV] that the triple (coh(O), E, tz ) is
ample. Hence if we take O = E in the above notations and we put R = Γ∗ (E) then
R is a noetherian H-graded ring and Γ∗ defines an equivalence between coh(O) and
qgr(R).
   Our next aim will be to show that R is in fact a weighted projective line. Un-
fortunately the autoequivalences ηh1 ,h2 clutter up our computations rather badly.
Therefore we will first give a more elegant description of R.
   Let D be the graded ring defined by
                                                                      e
                       D = A[u1 , u−1                −1       ei       j
                                   1 , . . . , ut , ut ]/(fi ui = fj uj )]
D is clearly H-graded by putting deg ui = hi .
  Let A be the graded order in D defined by
                               M
                        A=            (I1 u1 )p1 · · · (It ut )pt
                                   p1 ,... ,pt ∈Z

Now it is not hard to see that
                                    R = Hom(E, A ⊗O E)
We will determine the structure of R explicitly. A local computation shows that R
is equal to
               M
                      Γ(X, OX ([p1 /e1 ]x1 + · · · + [pt /et ]xt ))up11 · · · upt t
              p1 ,... ,pt ∈N

where [α] denote the biggest integer not bigger than α.
14                                   I. REITEN AND M. VAN DEN BERGH


   We first claim that R is generated by u1 , . . . , ut . By the relations in D it follows
that
                                                                                                                   p
     OX ([p1 /e1 ]x1 +· · ·+[(pi +ei )/ei ]xi +· · ·+[pj /ej ]xj +· · ·+[pt /et ]xt )up11 · · · uipi +ei · · · uj j · · · upt t
                                                                                                                p +ej
= OX ([p1 /e1 ]x1 +· · ·+[pi /ei ]xi +· · ·+[(pj +ej )/ej ]xj +· · ·+[pt /et ]xt )up11 · · · upi i · · · uj j           · · · upt t
as subsheaves of D. Hence to show that every section of OX ([p1 /e1 ]x1 + · · · +
[pt /et ]xt ])up11 · · · upt t is a linear combination of products of the ui ’s, it suffices to do
so in the case that pi < ei for i ≥ 2. So below we make this assumption.
    Write p1 = q1 + ae1 where q1 < e1 . We then have OX ([p1 /e1 ]x1 + · · · +
[pt /et ]xt ]) = OX (ax1 ). Let b1 , · · · , bt ∈ N be such that b1 + · · · + bt = a. Us-
ing the relations in D we find that
         uq11 +b1 e1 u2p2 +b2 e2 · · · upt t +bt et = f1b2 +···+bt /(f2b2 · · · ftbt )up11 up22 · · · upt t
The divisor of f1b2 +···+bt /(f2b2 · · · ftbt ) is equal to −a(x1 ) + ti=1 bi (xi ). Hence these
                                                                                 P
rational functions clearly generate the global sections of OX (ax1 ), which is what
we had to show.
   We now claim that up to changing f1 , (fi )i≥3 by a scalar we have the following
relations in R :
(A.3)                                 uei i − ue22 + λi ue11 = 0           (i ≥ 3)
where the (λi )i≥3 are suitable scalars with λ3 = 1.
   Rewriting ue22 and uei i in terms of u1 it follows that the relation (A.3) is equivalent
to the existence of a linear dependence
(A.4)                                        f1 /fi − f1 /f2 + λi = 0
Now the divisors of f1 /fi , f1 /f2 and 1 are respectively given by −(x1 ) + (xi ),
−(x1 ) + (x2 ) and 0. In particular these three rational functions are all sections of
OX (x1 ). Since OX (x1 ) has degree one, it follows that there has to be at least a
linear dependence
(A.5)                                      αf1 /fi + βf1 /f2 + γ = 0
Furthermore, inspecting divisors, it is easily seen that α, β, γ must all be non-zero.
Dividing (A.5) by −β and changing fi by a scalar yields (A.4). To make λ3 equal
to 1 we finish by changing f1 by a suitable scalar.
   At this point we know that R is a quotient of the “weighted projective line”
(A.6)                                 k[u1 , . . . , ut ]/(uei i − ue22 + λi ue11 )
However a straightforward computation reveals that R and the ring defined by
(A.6) have the same Hilbert series. Hence they are isomorphic. This concludes our
analysis of the case t ≥ 2.
   We will now discuss the other cases. First let t = 1. We define R as above. Now
dim Ri = 1 for i < e1 and dim Re = 2. Let v ∈ R2 \ kue1 . We leave it as an exercise
to the reader to check that R ∼   = k[u1 , v]. Hence coh(O) is again described by a
weighted projective line.
   The case t = 0 is even more trivial. In that case O is Morita equivalent to OP1 .
So coh(O) is in fact described by the ordinary projective line!
   To finish we show that one can get all weighted projective lines from hereditary
orders. It suffices to do this in the case t > 2. It is convenient to choose an affine
coordinate system on P1 in such a way that x1 = ∞, x2 = 0, x3 = 1. Then up to a
scalar we have
                                                  z−x
                      f1 (z) = z − x,    fi (z) =         for i > 1
                                                  z − xi
Computing the λi explicitly with the above procedure we find λi = xi . This shows
what we want.

        Appendix B. Examples of hereditary abelian categories
   In this appendix we give some sources of examples of hereditary abelian cate-
gories, which are usually not Ext-finite. These are inspired by [36].
   Let R be a noetherian ring of Krull dimension n ≥ 0, finitely generated as a
module over a central subring C. Denote by Mod R the category of R-modules
and as before by mod R the subcategory of finitely generated R-modules. For
i ≥ −1, let Ci be the subcategory of mod R whose objects have Krull dimension
at most i, and let C˜i be the subcategory of Mod R whose objects are direct limits
of objects in Ci . (We define C−1 = C˜−1 = (0).) Let qmodi (R) = mod R/Ci and
QModi (R) = Mod R/C̃i be the corresponding quotient categories in the sense of
[14]. These are abelian categories. Similarly we consider the case when S is a Z-
graded noetherian ring finitely generated over k and finitely generated as a module
over a central subring C, such that Si = 0 for i small enough. We make the
similar definitions starting with the category Gr S of graded S-modules with degree
zero homomorphisms, and the subcategory gr S of finitely generated modules. The
corresponding quotient categories will be denoted by QGri (S) and qgri (S). Below
when we work in the graded case all objects will be implicitly considered to be graded,
unless otherwise specified.
   We can now prove the following, which gives some classes of hereditary categories.
Proposition B.1. Let R be a noetherian ring of Krull dimension n ≥ 0 with the
above assumptions and notation. Assume that C satisfies Kdim C/P + ht P = n
for every prime ideal P in C. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
  (a) QModi (R) is nonzero hereditary.
  (b) qmodi (R) is nonzero hereditary.
  (c) Either i = n − 2 and gl. dim RP ≤ 1 for any prime ideal P in C of height at
      most 1 or i = n − 1 and gl. dim RP ≤ 1 for any prime ideal P in C of height
      0.
Proof. That(a) and (b) are equivalent follows from [31, Proposition A3]. To prove
the other equivalences we first review some generalities. First of all if M is an
R-module, then by [11, p430, Cor. 2] the Krull dimension of M as R-module is
equal to the Krull dimension of M as C-module.
   Furthermore we claim that M ∈ C˜i if and only if MP = 0 for all P ∈ Spec C
such that Kdim C/P < i (or equivalently, if and only if MP = 0 for all P such
that ht P > n − i). To see this we may assume that M is finitely generated. Then
it follows from the theory of associated primes that M has a finite filtration (as
C-module) with subquotients of the form C/Q with Q ∈ Spec C. The claim is now
an immediate verification.
   The subcategory C˜i of Mod R is a localizing subcategory. Since R is a noetherian
ring which is finitely generated as a module over its center, C˜i is closed under in-
jective envelopes [11, p. 431]. Denoting by T : Mod R → Mod R/C̃i the associated
quotient functor we have that T preserves injective objects and injective envelopes
by [31, Proposition A4]. So if 0 → M → I0 → I1 → · · · is a minimal injective res-
olution in Mod R, then 0 → T (M ) → T (I0 ) → T (I1 ) → · · · is a minimal injective
resolution in H̃i . A similar reasoning shows that for each prime ideal P in C, we
have that 0 → MP → (I0 )P → (I1 )P → · · · is a minimal injective resolution in
Mod RP .
   (c) ⇒ (a). Assume that (c) holds, and consider for M in Mod R a minimal
injective resolution 0 → M → I0 → I1 → · · · in Mod R, and the induced minimal
injective resolution 0 → MP → (I0 )P → (I1 )P → · · · for a prime ideal P in C.
   If i = n − 2 and gl. dim RP ≤ 1 for ht P ≤ 1, we get (Ij )P = 0 for j ≥ 2 and
ht P ≤ 1, and hence Ij is in C˜n−2 for j ≥ 2, so that T (Ij ) = 0. Then we have
16                          I. REITEN AND M. VAN DEN BERGH


an injective resolution 0 → T (M ) → T (I0 ) → T (I1 ) → 0 in QModn−2 (R), which
shows idQModn−2 (R) T (M ) ≤ 1. Since T is essentially surjective, it follows that
gl. dim QModn−2 (R) ≤ 1.
    If i = n − 1 and gl. dim RP ≤ 1 for ht P = 0, we get that Ij is in C˜n−1 for j ≥ 2,
so that 0 → T (M ) → T (I0 ) → T (I1 ) → 0 is an injective resolution of T (M ) in
QModn−1 (R). Hence we have gl. dim QModn−1 (R) ≤ 1.
    (a) ⇒ (c). Assume now that QModi (R) is hereditary, and let 0 → M → I0 →
I1 → · · · be a minimal injective resolution of some M in Mod R. Since then
0 → T (M ) → T (I0 ) → T (I1 ) → · · · is a minimal injective resolution in QModi (R),
it follows that T (Ij ) = 0 for j > 1. Then Ij is in C˜i for j > 1, so that we
have (Ij )P = 0 when ht P < n − i. Thus we we have the exact sequence 0 →
MP → (I0 )P → (I1 )P → 0 in this case, and hence gl. dim RP ≤ 1. Since for
a noetherian ring R which is finitely generated as a module over its center we
have Kdim RP ≤ gl. dim RP [7], and furthermore trivially Kdim CP ≤ Kdim RP , it
follows that n − i − 1 ≤ 1, so that n − i ≤ 2. Hence when QModi (R) 6= 0, we must
have i = n − 2 or i = n − 1. In the first case we have gl. dim RP ≤ 1 for ht P ≤ 1,
and in the second case gl. dim RP ≤ 1 for ht P = 0.
   In the case of graded rings S with the assumptions listed in the above, we
consider graded prime ideals P in the center C and graded localizations SP and
graded global dimension. Using that also in this case C˜i is closed under injective
envelopes [27], the proof of Proposition B.1 is easily adapted to give the following.
Proposition B.2. Let S be a Z-graded ring of Krull dimension n ≥ 0 satisfying
the standard assumptions, and with the previous notation. Suppose that C satisfies
Kdim C/P + ht P = n for every graded prime ideal P . Then the following are
equivalent.
  (a) QGri (S) is nonzero hereditary.
  (b) qgri (S) is nonzero hereditary.
  (c) Either i = n − 2 and gl. dim SP ≤ 1 for any graded prime ideal P in C of
      height at most 1 or i = n − 1 and gl. dim SP ≤ 1 for any graded prime ideal
      P in C of height 0.
     We also state the following special case.
Corollary B.3. Let S = C be a Z-graded commutative domain of Krull dimension
2 satisfying the standard assumptions. Then qgr(S) is hereditary if and only if S
is an isolated singularity.
