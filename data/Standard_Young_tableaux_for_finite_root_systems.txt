                                             Abstract. The study of representations of affine Hecke algebras has led to a new notion of shapes
                                             and standard Young tableaux which works for the root system of any finite Coxeter group. This
                                             paper is completely independent of affine Hecke algebra theory and is purely combinatorial. We
                                             define generalized shapes and standard Young tableaux and show that these new objects coincide
                                             with the classical ones for root systems of Type A. The classical notions of conjugation of shapes,
                                             ribbon shapes, axial distances, and the row reading and column reading standard tableaux, have
                                             natural generalizations to the root system case. In the final section we give an interpretation of
                                             the shapes and standard tableaux for root systems of Type C which is in a form similar to classical
                                             theory of shapes and standard tableaux.

                                             0. Introduction
                                                  In my recent work on representations of affine Hecke algebras [Ra1] I have been led to a
                                             generalization of standard Young tableaux. These generalized tableaux are important in the context
                                             of representation theory because the standard tableaux model the internal structure of irreducible
                                             representations of the affine Hecke algebra. In fact, most of the time the number of tableaux of
                                             a given shape is the same as the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation of the
                                             affine Hecke algebra.
                                                  In this paper I introduce and study generalized shapes and standard tableaux purely combina-
                                             torially. The main theorem is that the generalized standard tableaux of a given shape describe the
                                             connected components of a certain graph, the calibration graph. It is this graph which is intimately
                                             connected to the structure of representations of affine Hecke algebras.
                                                  In the Type A case the generalized shapes can be converted into “placed configurations of
                                             boxes”. This conversion is nontrivial and is the subject of Section 3. In the cases where this placed
                                             configuration of boxes is a placed skew shape the generalized standard tableaux coincide with the
                                             classical standard tableaux of a skew shape. The generalized skew shapes play a major role in the
                                             results on representations of affine Hecke algebras which are obtained in [Ra1].
                                                  In Section 1 I give definitions of
                                                   (a)   skew shapes,
                                                   (b)   ribbon shapes,
                                                   (c)   axial distances,
                                                   (d)   conjugation of shapes, and
                                                  ∗

     (e) row reading and column reading tableaux,
in the generalized setting. In Section 4 it is shown that these definitions yield the classical versions
of these objects in the Type A case. The last section of this paper explains how one can convert
the generalized shapes and standard tableaux for the Type C case into configurations of boxes and
fillings. In this form the shapes and standard tableaux for Type C look similar to the classical
standard Young tableaux.
      It is my hope that others will also take up the study of the generalized shapes and standard
tableaux introduced in this paper. There are many more problems than there is time for solving
them and every combinatorial fact which can be proved about these objects says something about
the structure of representations of affine Hecke algebras. One hopes that everything that is known
about classical standard Young tableaux will have an analogue in this more general setting. Al-
though I have uncovered some of these generalizations, there are many facets of classical tableaux
theory which still need to be generalized.
      From a representation theoretic point of view, one expects that there might exist generaliza-
tions of
       (a) the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence,
      (b) the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients,
       (c) the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials,
      (d) major index and descents of tableaux,
       (e) charge of tableaux,
       (f) Jacobi-Trudi formulas.
Any solutions to these problems would be extremely helpful for understanding the underlying
representation theory. It is possible that some of the generalizations might be obtained simply by
understanding how to do them for the Type C tableaux given in the last section of this paper.
This approach is attractive since the form of the Type C tableaux given in the last section looks
so similar to classical tableau theory.

Remarks on the results in this paper
(1) Recently, it has become clear to me that one of the reasons that skew Schur functions play
    such a important role in the classical theory of symmetric functions is because the skew shapes
    describe particularly well behaved irreducible representations of the affine Hecke algebra of
    type A. Since these nice representations exist in all types it seems reasonable that the many
    wonderful identities involving skew Schur functions should have general type analogues in
    terms of the generalized skew shapes defined in this paper. An example of a skew Schur
    function identity that has a particularly nice generalization to all types is the identity in [Mac
    I §5 Ex. 21b].
(2) A remark similar to (1) can be made concerning ribbon shapes. This special class of shapes
    has a good generalization to all types and the representation theory associated to ribbon
    shapes has special features [Ro], [Mat, 4.3.5]. This fact seems to give some philosophical
    “reason” why there is such an amazing theory of ribbon Schur functions. The theory of
    ribbon Schur functions has been developed in the last decade by Lascoux, Leclerc, Thibon,
    Krob, Reutenauer, Malvenuto and others [GK] [La1-2]. I am sure that there is much to learn
    about the representation theory of affine Hecke algebras from what is already known in the
    ribbon (and noncommutative) Schur function theory.
(3) The theory of generalized shapes gives rise to some strange new shapes even in the type A
    case, see Section 3.6. To my knowledge these shapes have not been studied before but they do
    retain many of the combinatorial properties that skew shapes have. In particular, standard
                        standard young tableaux for root systems                                      3

    tableaux make perfectly good sense for these shapes and these strange standard tableaux do
    have representation theoretic meaning.
(4) There seem to be strong connections between the combinatorics in this paper, the combina-
    torics of the Shi arrangements (see [St1-2], [AL], [He], [ST]) and the combinatorics of sign
    types developed by Shi [Sh3]. These connections need to be better understood.
(5) I do not think that there is a connection between the generalized standard Young tableaux
    introduced in this paper and the generalized tableaux of P. Littelmann [Li1-2]. Littelmann’s
    analogue of tableaux are really a generalization of column strict tableaux not of standard
    tableaux. Column strict tableaux give information about the representations of GLn (C) and
    standard tableaux give information about the representations of the symmetric group Sn .
    There is an analogous dichotomy in the generalized case; Littelmann’s generalized column
    strict tableaux model the representations of complex semisimple Lie groups and my generalized
    standard tableaux model the representations of affine Hecke algebras. At the moment, I do
    not believe that there is any connection between the representation theories of the complex
    Lie groups and the affine Hecke algebras which would allow one to transfer information from
    one side to the other (except in the type A case, where one has a Schur-Weyl type duality.)

     This paper is only a part of a large project [Ra1-3] [RR1-2] on representations of affine Hecke
algebras which I have been working on intensely for about a year. During that time I have benefited
from conversations with many people. To choose only a few, there were discussions with S. Fomin,
M. Vazirani, L. Solomon, F. Knop and N. Wallach which played an important role in my progress.
There were several times when I tapped into J. Stembridge’s fountain of useful knowledge about
root systems. G. Benkart was a very patient listener on many occasions. R. Simion, T. Halverson,
H. Barcelo, P. Deligne, and R. Macpherson all gave large amounts of time to let me tell them my
story and every one of these sessions was helpful to me in solidifying my understanding. I thank
C. Kriloff for her amazing proofreading.
     I single out Jacqui Ramagge with special thanks for everything she has done to help with
this project: from the most mundane typing and picture drawing to deep intense mathematical
conversations which helped to sort out many pieces of this theory. Her immense contribution is
evident in that some of the papers in this series on representations of affine Hecke algebras are
joint papers.
     A portion of this research was done during a semester stay at Mathematical Sciences Research

1. Generalized shapes and standard Young tableaux

(1.1) Notations.       Let W be a finite Coxeter group and let R be the root system of W . The
root system R spans a real vector space which we shall denote Rn . There is an inner product on
Rn via which W is a group generated by reflections. Fix a system R+ of positive roots in R and
write α > 0 if α ∈ R+ . If w ∈ W the inversion set of w is

                                     R(w) = {α > 0 | wα < 0 }.

Let {α1 , . . . , αn } be the simple roots in R+ and let s1 , . . . , sn denote the corresponding simple
reflections in W . The positive roots determine a fundamental chamber C = {x ∈ Rn | hx, αi >
0 for all α ∈ R+ }. An element x ∈ Rn is dominant if x ∈ C, the closure of the chamber C.

(1.2) Placed shapes and standard tableaux.  If γ ∈ C define

           Z(γ) = α ∈ R+ | hγ, αi = 0
                                     	
                                        and    P (γ) = {α ∈ R | hγ, αi = 1} .

The set Z(γ) ∪ −Z(γ) is a (parabolic) root subsystem of R and is generated by the simple roots
that it contains. The stabilizer Wγ of γ in W is the Weyl group of the subsystem Z(γ) and the
set P (γ) is stable under the action of Wγ .

Remark. The sets Z(γ) and P (γ) appear in Heckman and Opdam [HO, Definition 2.1] and im-
plicitly in other works [K1, Theorem 2.2].

     A placed shape is a pair (γ, J ) where γ ∈ C and J ⊆ P (γ). A standard tableau of shape (γ, J )
is an element w ∈ W such that

                               R(w) ∩ Z = ∅         and     R(w) ∩ P = J.

In Theorem 3.5 we shall show that this is a generalization of the classical notion of standard Young
tableau. Let
                         F (γ,J) = { standard tableaux of shape (γ, J )}.

Examples
(1) If γ is a generic element of Rn then Z(γ) = P (γ) = ∅. In this case the only possibility for J
                       (γ,∅)
    is J = ∅ and  PF         = W.
               1
(2) Let ρ = 2 α>0 α∨ , where α∨ = 2α/(α, α). Then Z(ρ) = ∅ and P (ρ) = {α1 , . . . , αn }. If
    J ⊆ {α1 , . . . , αn } we have

                  F (ρ,J) = {w ∈ W | D(w) = J },           where D(w) = {αi | wsi < w}

     is the right descent set of w ∈ W .

(1.3) A nonemptiness condition.          I feel that the following conjecture should have a simple
slick proof. The =⇒ direction is easy and it may be possible to prove the other direction by using
[Bou, Ch. VI §1, Prop. 22]. For Type A the conjecture is true and is a consequence of Theorem
4.5 of section 4.

Conjecture. Let (γ, J ) be a shape. The set F (γ,J) is non-empty if and only if J satisfies the
condition
                       If β ∈ J , α ∈ Z and β − α ∈ R+ then β − α ∈ J .

(1.4) Placed skew shapes.           If γ ∈ Rn view γ as the function on the root system R given by

                                           γ:   R   −→      R
                                                α   7−→   hγ, αi

The element γ is regular if hγ, αi =    6 0 for all α ∈ R, and is integral if hγ, αi ∈ Z for all α ∈ R. For
each subset K ⊆ {α1 , . . . , αn } let RK be the root system generated by K and let WK be the Weyl
group of RK . Let γ K denote the function γ restricted to RK .
    A placed shape (γ, J ) is a placed skew shape if for all w ∈ F (γ,J) ,
                                          
     (a) for each simple root αi , wγ  {αi }
                                                is regular, and
                       standard young tableaux for root systems                                    5

                                roots {αi , αj }
     (b) for each pair of simple
              either        wγ {α ,α } is regular
                                i j
                  or        wγ 
                               {αi ,αj }
                                        is in the W{α   -orbit of
                                                     i ,αj }

                           the function τ given by hτ, αi i = 1 and hτ, αj i = 0,
                           where αi is long and αj is short.

Remark. In the type A case, a definition of skew shape similar to the one given above has also been
given by Fomin [Fo] in connection with his approach to the theory of seminormal representations
of the symmetric group.


(1.5) Ribbon shapes.       A placed shape (γ, J ) is a placed ribbon shape if Z(γ) = ∅. All placed
ribbon shapes are placed skew shapes.
Example. Suppose that (γ, J ), is a ribbon shape and γ is integral. Then Z(γ) = ∅, P (γ) ⊆
{α1 , . . . , αn } and
                             F (γ,J) = {w ∈ W | L(w) ∩ P = J },
where, as in Example 2 of (1.2), L(w) is the left descent set of w.

(1.6)     Although we shall not define the affine Hecke algebra or discuss its representation theory
in this paper it is important to note that the definition of placed skew shape is motivated by the
following theorem of [Ra1].

Theorem. Let R be the root system of a finite Weyl group and let H̃ be the corresponding
affine Hecke algebra. There is a one-to-one correspondence between placed skew shapes (γ, J )
and irreducible really calibrated representations H̃ (γ,J) of the affine Hecke algebra H̃. Under this
correspondence
                     dim(H̃ (γ,J) ) = ( # of standard tableaux of shape (γ, J )).



(1.7) Conjugation.        Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape and let Wγ be the stabilizer of γ in W .
Define the conjugate placed shape to be

                                   (γ, J )′ = (−uγ, −u(P (γ) \ J )),

where u is the minimal length coset representative of w0 Wγ ∈ W/Wγ and w0 is the longest element
of W .
    It will be useful to note the following:

    (a) P (−uγ) = −uP (γ),                 (b) Z(−uγ) = uZ(γ),           (c) R(u) = R+ \Z(γ).

The proofs are as follows:
(a) Since γ is dominant, −uγ = −w0 γ is dominant and thus h−uγ, −uαi = 1 only if −uα > 0.
    With this in mind P (−uγ) = −uP (γ) follows from the equation h−uγ, −uαi = 1 ⇐⇒ hγ, αi =
    1.
(b) Let v ∈ Wγ such that w0 = uv. (By [Bou IV §1 Ex. 3], v is unique.) Then R+ ⊇ −w0 Z(γ) =
    −uvZ(γ) = uZ(γ), and it follows that

             Z(−uγ) = R+ ∩ {α ∈ R | huγ, αi = 0} = R+ ∩ (uZ(γ) ∪ −uZ(γ)) = uZ(γ).
6                                               arun ram

(c) Let R− = −R+ be the set of negative roots in R. Let v ∈ Wγ such that w0 = uv. Then v is
    the longest element of Wγ and R(v) = Z(γ). Thus

                       R(u) = {α ∈ R | α ∈ R+ , w0 vα ∈ R− }
                             = {α ∈ R | α ∈ R+ , vα ∈ R+ },         since w0 R− = R+ ,
                             = R+ \R(v) = R+ \Z(γ).


(1.8) Proposition. Conjugation (γ, J ) ←→ (γ, J )′ is a well defined involution on placed shapes.

Proof.
(a) The weight −uγ = −uvγ = −w0 γ is dominant (i.e. −uγ ∈ C) and −u(P (γ)\J ) ⊆ P (−uγ)
    since −uP (γ) = P (−uγ). This shows that (γ, J )′ is well defined.
(b) Write w0 = uv where where v is the longest element of Wγ . Similarly, write w0 = u′ v ′ where
    u′ is the minimal length coset representative of w0 Ww0 γ and v ′ is the longest element in Ww0 γ .
    Conjugation by w0 is an involution on W which takes simple reflections to simple reflections
    and Ww0 γ = w0 Wγ w0 . It follows that v ′ = w0 vw0 . This gives

                                   u′ u = (w0 v ′ )(w0 v) = w0 w0 vw0 w0 v = 1.

    Then, using fact (1.7a) above,

    −u′ (P (−uγ)\(−u(P (γ)\J ))) = −u′ (−uP (γ)\(−u(P (γ)\J ))) = P (γ)\(P (γ)\J ) = J.

In (4.4) we shall show that this involution is a generalization of the classical conjugation operation
on partitions.

Remark. In type A, the conjugation involution seems to coincide with the duality operation for
representations of p-adic GL(n) defined by Zelevinsky [Ze]. Zelevinsky’s involution has been been

(1.9) Proposition. The conjugation of shapes involution extends to an involution on standard
tableaux given by                         1−1          ′
                                  F (γ,J) ←→ F (γ,J)
                                    w     ←→ wu−1
where u is the minimal length coset representative of the coset w0 Wγ .

Proof. Let w ∈ F (γ,J) and let w′ = wu−1 . We must show that R(w′ ) ∩ Z(−uγ) = ∅ and
R(w′ ) ∩ P (−uγ) = −u(P (γ \ J )). Let R− = −R+ be the set of negative roots. We shall use the
facts in (1.7) freely.
(a) Since R(w) ∩ Z(γ) = ∅, we get

      u−1 R(wu−1 ) ∩ Z(γ) = {β ∈ R | uβ ∈ R(wu−1 ), β ∈ Z(γ)}
                            = {β ∈ R | uβ ∈ R+ , wu−1 uβ ∈ R− , β ∈ Z(γ)}
                            = {β ∈ R | β ∈ u−1 R+ , wβ ∈ R− , β ∈ Z(γ)}
                            = {β ∈ R | β ∈ u−1 R+ , β ∈ R(w), β ∈ Z(γ)},          since Z(γ) ⊆ R+ ,
                            = {β ∈ R | β ∈ u−1 R+ , β ∈ R(w) ∩ Z(γ)}

and it follows that
               R(w′ ) ∩ Z(−uγ) = R(wu−1 ) ∩ uZ(γ) = u u−1 R(wu−1 ) ∩ Z(γ) = ∅.
                                                                         

(b) Assume that w ∈ W is such that R(w) ∩ P (γ) = J . Then
    −u−1 R(wu−1 ) ∩ P (γ) = {β ∈ R | − uβ ∈ R(wu−1 ), β ∈ P (γ)}
                           = {β ∈ R | − uβ ∈ R+ , −wu−1 uβ ∈ R− , β ∈ P (γ)}
                           = {β ∈ R | uβ ∈ R− , wβ ∈ R+ , β ∈ P (γ)}
                           = {β ∈ R | β ∈ R(u), β ∈ R+ \R(w), β ∈ P (γ)},       since P (γ) ⊆ R+
                           = {β ∈ R | β ∈ R+ \Z(γ), β ∈ R+ \R(w), β ∈ P (γ)}
                           = {β ∈ R | β ∈ R+ \Z(γ), β ∈ P (γ)\J },     since R(w) ∩ P (γ) = J ,
                           = P (γ)\J,    since Z(γ) and P (γ) are disjoint.
This yields
R(w′ ) ∩ P (−uγ) = R(wu−1 ) ∩ −uP (γ) = −u −u−1 R(wu−1 ) ∩ P (γ) = −u (P (γ)\J ) .
                                                                



(1.10) Axial distances.          Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape and let w ∈ F (γ,J) be a standard
tableaux of shape (γ, J ). Let α ∈ R be a root. The α-axial distance for w is the value
                                          dα (w) = hwγ, αi.
These numbers are crucial to the construction of irreducible representations of the affine Hecke
algebra which is given in [Ra1]. In (4.1) we shall see that they are analogues of the axial distances
used by A. Young [Y] in his constructions of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group.

(1.11) Row reading and column reading tableaux.              If w ∈ W let R(w) be the inversion
set of w. The weak Bruhat order is the partial order on W given by
                                   v≤w        if    R(v) ⊆ R(w).
This definition is not the usual definition of the weak Bruhat order but is equivalent to the usual
one by [Bj, Prop. 2].
     Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape. A column reading tableau of shape (γ, J ) is a minimal element
of F (γ,J) in the weak Bruhat order. A row reading tableau of shape (γ, J ) is a maximal element of
F (γ,J) in the weak Bruhat order.
     A set of positive roots K is closed if α, β ∈ K, α + β ∈ R+ implies that α + β ∈ K. The
closure K of a subset K ⊆ R+ is the smallest closed subset of R+ containing K.
     The following conjecture says that if γ is integral and F (γ,J) is nonempty then F (γ,J) contains
a unique column reading tableau and a unique row reading tableau. A proof of the conjecture in
the type A case is given in Theorem 4.5.

Conjecture. Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape such that γ is dominant and integral. If F (γ,J) 6= ∅
then
                                                        c
      R(wmin ) = J,       R(wmax ) = (P (γ) \ J ) ∪ Z(γ) ,     and      F (γ,J) = [wmin , wmax ],
where K c denotes the complement of K in R+ and [wmin , wmax ] denotes the interval between wmin
and wmax in the weak Bruhat order.


2. Calibration graphs
8                                                arun ram

     The following graphs arise naturally in the study of representations of affine Hecke algebras,
see [Ro], [Rg, Prop. 3.5], and [Ra1]. Let γ ∈ Rn . The calibration graph Γ(γ) is the graph with

                         Vertices:         Wγ
                           Edges:       wγ ←→ si wγ,         if      hwγ, αi i =
                                                                               6 ±1.


(2.1) Theorem. Assume that γ ∈ Rn is dominant and let Γ(γ) be the corresponding calibration
graph. The connected components of Γ(γ) are described by the sets

                        F (γ,J)      such that     J ⊆ P (γ) and F (γ,J) 6= ∅,

where F (γ,J) is the set of standard tableaux of shape (γ, J ) defined in (1.2).


(2.2)    This theorem will become almost obvious once we change our point of view. The root
system R determines a (central) hyperplane arrangement

                    A = {Hα | α ∈ R},        where      Hα = {x ∈ Rn | hx, αi = 0}.

The set of chambers (connected components) of Rn \(
                                                         S
                                                            α     Hα ) is

            C = {wC | w ∈ W },          where      C = {x ∈ Rn | hx, αi > 0 for all α > 0}

is the fundamental chamber. A chamber C̃ ∈ C is on the positive side (resp. negative side) of the
hyperplane Hα , α ∈ R+ , if hx, αi > 0 (resp. hx, αi < 0) for all x ∈ C̃. The following Proposition
allows us to view the calibration graph Γ(γ) in terms of chambers in Rn . Example 2.7 at the end
of this section illustrates the conversion.

Proposition. Assume that γ ∈ Rn is dominant. Let Z(γ) and P (γ) be as defined in (1.2) and let
Γ(γ) be the calibration graph containing γ.

(b) Two vertices uγ and vγ in Γ(γ)        are connected by an edge if and only if the corresponding
    chambers u−1 C and v −1 C share       a face and the hyperplane Hα containing this face satisfies
    α 6∈ P (γ).

Proof. (a) Since γ is dominant the stabilizer Wγ of γ is a parabolic subgroup of W . It is generated by

                ←→

where C = {x ∈ E | hx, αi > 0 for all α > 0} is the fundamental chamber. Let us give a step by
step explanation.
 (1) There is a natural bijection between W γ and W/Wγ .
 (2) Since each coset in W/Wγ has a unique coset representative of minimal length (see [Bou, IV.1,
     Exercise 3] or [Hum, Proposition 1.10c]) we may identify W γ with the set of minimal length
     coset representatives of W/Wγ .
 (3) The chambers of Rn \(∪α Hα ) are the regions wC, w ∈ W and thus we can identify W γ with
     the set {wC | w is a minimal length coset representative of W/Wγ } .
 (4) An element w ∈ W is a minimal length coset representative of W/Wγ if ℓ(wsi ) > ℓ(w) for
     every i such that αi ∈ Z(γ).
 (5) So w is a minimal length coset representative if and only if, for any x ∈ C, hw−1 x, αi i > 0
     for every αi ∈ Z(γ). Since Z(γ) ∪ −Z(γ) is a root subsystem generated by the simple roots
     that it contains we have that w is a minimal length coset representative if and only if, for
     any x ∈ C, hw−1 x, αi > 0 for every α ∈ Z(γ). Thus, we 	may identify W γ with the set
       wC | w−1 C is on the positive side of Hα for every α ∈ Z(γ) .
     

 (6) The final step is to replace each chamber wC by the chamber w−1 C.
     (b) Recall that uγ and vγ are connected by an edge in Γ(γ) if uγ = si vγ and hvγ, αi i =   6 ±1.
If u and v are minimal length coset representatives of W/Wγ , then the chambers u−1 C and v −1 C
should be connected by an edge if u = si v and hγ, v −1 αi i =
                                                             6 ±1. The condition that u = si v means
that u C = v si C. Since C and si C share a face, it follows that u−1 C = v −1 si C and v −1 C
       −1       −1

share a face. This face is contained in the hyperplane Hv−1 αi = Hu−1 αi since the face that C and
si C share is contained in the hyperplane Hαi . Finally, the condition hγ, v −1 αi i =
                                                                                     6 ±1 is the same
                 −1                 −1
as saying that v αi 6∈ P (γ) and u αi 6∈ P (γ).
     (c) If w ∈ W , α > 0, x ∈ C and wα < 0 then hw−1 x, αi = hx, wαi < 0. Thus

                      R(w) = α > 0 | w−1 C is on the negative side of Hα .
                                                                       	


So the condition R(w) ∩ Z(γ) = ∅ is equivalent to the condition that w−1 C is on the positive side
of Hα for all α ∈ Z(γ). Similarly the condition R(w) ∩ P (γ) = J is equivalent to the condition
that w−1 C be on the negative side of Hα for all α ∈ J and on the positive side of Hα for all
α ∈ P (γ) \ J .

     Parts
         S(a) and (b) of Proposition 2.2 allow us to view the calibration graph in terms of chambers
in Rn \ ( α Hα ). The vertices correspond to the chambers on the positive side of the hyperplanes
Hα , α ∈ Z(γ). The edges of the graph are now the walls between the chambers. The only time that
a wall between two chambers does not form an “edge of the graph” connecting the two chambers
(vertices) is when that wall is contained in a hyperplane Hα with α ∈ P (γ).

(2.3) Proof of Theorem 2.1 From parts (a) and (b) of Proposition 2.2 we get that the connected
components of the graph Γ(γ) correspond to the connected components of the intersection of
                                                                                     
      n                                                   o                  [
        C̃ | C̃ is on the positive side of Hα for α ∈ Z(γ)  with   Rn \          Hα  .
                                                                                 α∈P (γ)


Proposition 2.2 (c) says that the standard tableaux of shape (γ, J ) correspond to the chambers
which are on the positive side of Hα for α ∈ Z(γ) ∪ (P (γ) \ J ) and on the negative side of Hα
for α ∈ J . The points
                    in the chambers which satisfy these conditions form a connected subset of
  n
        S
R \      α∈P (γ) Hα since the conditions describe them as the points in the intersection of half-
                                                                                  S             
spaces in Rn . Finally, one only needs to note that the connected components Rn \    α∈P (γ) H α
are determined by which subset of hyperplanes in P (γ) they are on the negative side of. This
completes the proof of Theorem 2.1.


(2.4) Invariance properties for calibration graphs.
Invariance property (1): As unlabeled graphs, Γ(γ) = Γ(wγ) for all w ∈ W .
Invariance property (2): If Z(γ) = Z(κ) and P (γ) = P (κ) then Γ(γ) = Γ(κ).
Property (1) is immediate from the definition of Γ(γ). From the definition of the calibration graph
one sees that the edges of Γ(γ) are controlled by the set P (γ). Since the vertices W γ can be
identified with the set W/Wγ , where Wγ is the stabilizer of γ, it follows that the graph Γ(γ)
depends only on Wγ and the set P (γ). Since Wγ is the group generated by the reflections sα for
α ∈ Z(γ), it follows that the structure of Γ(γ) is dependent only on the sets Z(γ) and P (γ). This
establishes invariance property (2).

(2.5) Intersections and shapes.         Let A be the arrangement of (affine) hyperplanes given by

                                                             Hα = {x ∈ Rn | hx, αi = 0},
          A′ = {Hα−δ , Hα , Hα+δ | α ∈ R+ },    where      Hα+δ = {x ∈ Rn | hx, αi = 1},
                                                           Hα−δ = {x ∈ Rn | hx, αi = −1}.

The intersection lattice L(A′ ) is the set of intersections, I = Hβ ∈B Hβ , B ⊆ A′ , partially ordered
                                                                T

by inclusion (as subsets of Rn ). Since A′ is symmetric under the Weyl group L(A′ ) also carries a
Weyl group symmetry. The quotient L(A′ )/W is constructed by identifying intersections I1 and I2
if there is a w ∈ W such that wI1 = I2 . It follows from the invariance properties of the calibration
graphs that the distinct calibration graphs are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of
the quotient L(A′ )/W . In particular, the number of distinct calibration graphs is finite.
     Let (γ, J ) and (η, K) be two placed shapes. We shall say that (γ, J ) and (η, K) have the same
underlying shape if there is a w ∈ W such that

                     Z(wγ) = Z(η),       P (wγ) = P (η),       and     wJ = K.

When (γ, J ) and (η, K) are placed shapes with the same underlying shape then the calibration
graphs Γ(γ) and Γ(κ) are the same and there is a natural bijection

(2.6)      It would be interesting to determine the size of L(A′ )/W , i.e. the number of distinct
calibration graphs. A. Postnikov has explained that in the Type A case the numbers f (n) =
Card(L(A′ )/Sn ) have the following generating function
                                   Y             k−1   X
                                      (1 − q k )2    =   f (n)q n .

One can prove this by counting the number of ways of constructing the configurations of boxes
described in Section 3.
    The arrangement A′ is very similar to the Shi arrangement

                                                                                                        A′′ = {Hα , Hα+δ | α ∈ R+ }.

C. Athanasiadis has told me that, for the type A case, the number of elements of the intersection
lattice L(A′′ ) which contain a dominant weight is equal to

where F1 = 1, F3 = 2, F5 = 5, . . . are the odd Fibonacci numbers. The Shi arrangement has been
an object of intense recent study, see [Sh3], [St1], [AL]. There are many indications [Sh3], [Xi,1.11,
2.6] that there should be a strong connection between the work in this paper and the combinatorics
of the Shi arrangement.

(2.7) Example.        Consider the root system of type C2 where R+ = {α1 , α2 , α1 + α2 , α1 + 2α2 }.
Realize this root system in R2 by letting α1 = 2ε1 and α2 = ε2 −ε1 , where {ε1 , ε2 } is an orthonormal
basis of R2 . Let γ ∈ R2 be given by hγ, α1 i = 0 and hγ, α2 i = 1. Then γ is dominant (i.e. in C)
and integral and
                          Z(γ) = {α1 }      and     P (γ) = {α2 , α1 + α2 }.

3. Type A and configurations of boxes


(3.1) The root system.             Let {ε1 , . . . , εn } be an orthonormal basis of Rn so that each sequence
γ = (γ1 , . . . , γn ) ∈ Rn is identified with the vector γ = i γi εi . The root system of type An−1 is
                                                                    P
given by the sets

                 R = {εj − εi | 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}                                                                                                 and R+ = {εj − εi | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} .

The Weyl group is W = Sn , the symmetric group, acting by permutations of the εi .

(3.2) Partitions, skew shapes, and (classical) standard tableaux.             A partition λ is a
collection of n boxes in a corner. We shall conform to the conventions in [Mac] and assume that
gravity goes up and to the left.




Any partition λ can be identified with the sequence λ = (λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . .) where λi is the number
of boxes in row i of λ. The rows and columns are numbered in the same way as for matrices. In
the example above we have λ = (553311).
     If λ and µ are partitions such that µi ≤ λi for all i we write µ ⊆ λ. The skew shape λ/µ
consists of all boxes of λ which are not in µ. Let λ/µ be a skew shape with n boxes. Number the
boxes of each skew shape λ/µ along major diagonals from southwest to northeast and

                             write boxi to indicate the box numbered i.

See Example 3.4 below. A (classical) standard tableau of shape λ/µ is a filling of the boxes in the
skew shape λ/µ with the numbers 1, . . . , n such that the numbers increase from left to right in
each row and from top to bottom down each column. Let F λ/µ be the set of standard tableaux of
shape λ/µ. Given a standard tableau t of shape λ/µ define the word of t to be permutation
                                                                           
                                                   1       ···      n
                                   wt =
                                                t(box1 )   ...   t(boxn )

where t(boxi ) is the entry in boxi of t.

(3.3) Placed skew shapes         Let λ/µ be a skew shape with n boxes. Imagine placing λ/µ on
a piece of infinite graph paper where the diagonals of the graph paper are indexed consecutively
(with elements of Z) from southeast to northwest. The content of a box b is the number c(b) of
the diagonal that b is on. Let

(in one-line notation).
     The following picture shows the contents of the boxes in the placed skew shape (γ, λ/µ) with
γ = (−7, −6, −5, −2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6).

In this case J = {ε2 − ε1 , ε6 − ε5 , ε8 − ε7 , ε10 − ε8 , ε10 − ε9 , ε11 − ε9 , ε12 − ε11 }.


(3.5)      The following theorem shows how the generalized standard tableaux defined in (1.2)
reduce to the classical standard Young tableaux in the type A case.

Theorem. Let (γ, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape and let J be as defined in (3.3). Let F λ/µ be the
set of standard tableaux of shape λ/µ and let F (γ,J) be the set of generalized standard tableaux
of shape (γ, J ) as defined in (1.2). Then the map
                                                          1−1
                                             F λ/µ    ←→        F (γ,J)
                                               t      ←→         wt ,

where wt is as defined in (3.2), is a bijection.

Proof. If w = (w(1) · · · w(n)) is a permutation in Sn then

                            R(w) = {εj − εi | j > i such that w(j) < w(i) }.

The theorem is a consequence of the following chain of equivalences:
The filling t is a standard tableau if and only if for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n
(a) t(boxi ) < t(boxj ) if boxi and boxj are on the same diagonal,
(b) t(boxi ) < t(boxj ) if boxj is immediately to the right of boxi , and
                          standard young tableaux for root systems                                                 15

(c) t(boxi ) > t(boxj ) if boxj is immediately above boxi .
These conditions hold if and only if
(a) εj − εi 6∈ R(w(t)) if εj − εi ∈ Z(γ),
(b) εj − εi 6∈ R(w(t)) if εj − εi ∈ P (γ) \ J ,
(c) εj − εi ∈ R(w(t)) if εj − εi ∈ J ,
which hold if and only if

(a) α 6∈ R(w(t)) if α ∈ Z(γ), (b) α 6∈ R(w(t)) if α ∈ P (γ) \ J ,               and (c) α ∈ R(w(t)) if α ∈ J .

Finally, these are equivalent to the conditions R(w(t)) ∩ Z(γ) = ∅ and R(w(t)) ∩ P (γ) = J .


(3.6) Placed configurations           We have described how one can identify placed skew shapes
(γ, λ/µ) with pairs (γ, J ). One can extend this conversion to associate placed configurations of
boxes to more general pairs (γ, J ). The resulting configurations are not always skew shapes.
     Let (γ, J ) be a pair such that γ = (γ1 , . . . , γn ) is a dominant integral weight and J ⊆ P (γ).
(The sequence γ is a dominant integral weight if γ1 ≤ · · · ≤ γn and γi ∈ Z for all i.) If J satisfies
the condition
                        If β ∈ J , α ∈ Z(γ), and β − α ∈ R+ then β − α ∈ J
then (γ, J ) will determine a placed configuration of boxes. As in the placed skew shape case, think
of the boxes as being placed on graph paper where the boxes on a given diagonal all have the
same content. (The boxes on each diagonal are allowed to slide along the diagonal as long as they
don’t pass through the corner of a box on an adjacent diagonal.) The sequence γ describes how
many boxes are on each diagonal and the set J determines how the boxes on adjacent diagonals
are placed relative to each other. We want
                                                     n
                                                     X
                                                γ=          c(boxi )εi ,
                                                      i=1

and
       (a) If εj − εi ∈ J then boxj is northwest of boxi , and
      (b) If εj − εi ∈ P (γ)\J then boxj is southeast of boxi ,
where the boxes are numbered along diagonals in the same way as for skew shapes, southeast means
weakly south and strictly east, and northwest means strictly north and weakly west.
      If we view the pair (γ, J ) as a placed configuration of boxes then the standard tableaux are
fillings t of the n boxes in the configuration with 1, 2, . . . , n such that for all i < j
 (a) t(boxi ) < t(boxj ) if boxi and boxj are on the same diagonal,
 (b) t(boxi ) < t(boxj ) if boxi and boxj are on adjacent diagonals and boxj is southeast of boxi ,
      and
 (c) t(boxi ) > t(boxj ) if boxi and boxj are on adjacent diagonals and boxj is northwest of boxi .
As in Theorem 3.5 the permutation in F (γ,J) which corresponds to the standard tableau t is
w(t) = (t(box1 ), . . . , t(boxn )). The following example illustrates the conversion.

Example. Suppose γ = (−1, −1, −1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2) and

      J = {ε4 − ε1 , ε4 − ε2 , ε4 − ε3 , ε5 − ε2 , ε5 − ε3 , ε7 − ε5 , ε7 − ε6 , ε8 − ε6 , ε10 − ε9 , ε10 − ε8 ,
             ε10 − ε7 , ε11 − ε9 , ε11 − ε8 , ε11 − ε7 , ε12 − ε9 } .

(3.7) Books of placed configurations.                The most general case to consider is when γ =
                                               n
(γ1 , . . . , γn ) is an arbitrary element of R and J ⊆ P (γ). This case is handled as follows. First
group the entries of γ according to their Z-coset in R. Each group of entries in γ can be arranged
to form a sequence

 β + Cβ = β + (z1 , . . . , zk ) = (β + z1 , . . . , β + zk ),      where 0 ≤ β < 1, zi ∈ Z and z1 ≤ · · · ≤ zk .

Fix some ordering of these groups and let

                                          ~γ = (β1 + Cβ1 , . . . , βr + Cβr )

be the rearrangement of the sequence γ with the groups listed in order. Since ~γ is a rearrangement
of γ, the calibration graphs Γ(γ) and Γ(~γ ) are the same (see Invariance Property (1) in (2.4)). This
means that it is sufficient to understand the standard tableaux corresponding to ~γ .
     The decomposition of ~γ into groups induces decompositions
                        [                         [                                              [
             Z(~γ ) =        Zβi ,    P (~γ ) =        Pβi ,    and, if J ⊆ P (~γ ), then   J=        Jβi ,
                        βi                        βi                                             βi


where Jβi = J ∩ Pβi . Each pair (Cβ , Jβ ) is a placed shape of the type considered in the previous
subsection and we may identify (~γ , J ) with the book of placed shapes ((Cβ1 , Jβ1 ), . . . , (Cβr , Jβr )).
We think of this as a book with pages numbered by the values β1 , . . . , βr and with the placed
configuration determined by (Cβi , Jβi ) on page βi . In this form the standard tableaux of shape
(~γ , J ) are fillings of the n boxes in the book with the numbers 1, . . . , n such that the filling on each
page satisfies the conditions for a standard tableau in (3.6).

Example. If γ = (1/2, 1/2, 1, 1, 1, 3/2, −2, −2, −1/2, −1, −1, −1, −1/2, 1/2, 0, 0, 0) then one possi-
bility for ~γ is

                 ~γ = (−2, −2, −1, −1, −1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, −1/2, −1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 3/2).

In this case β1 = 0, β2 = 1/2,

β1 + Cβ1 = (−2, −2, −1, −1, −1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)              and β2 + Cβ2 = (−1/2, −1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 3/2).

4. Skew shapes, ribbons, conjugation, etc. in Type A
     As in the previous section let R be the root system of Type An−1 as given in (3.1). For clarity,
we shall state all of the results in this section for placed shapes (γ, J ) such that γ is dominant and
integral, i.e. γ = (γ1 , . . . , γn ) with γ1 ≤ · · · γn and γi ∈ Z. This simplification is mathematically
unimportant, the reason for it is that it allows us to avoid the notational difficulties which arise
when one wants to use books of placed shapes with several pages.

(4.1) Axial distance Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape such that γ is dominant and integral. Let
w ∈ F (γ,J) and let t be the corresponding standard tableau as defined by the map in Theorem 3.5.
Then it follows from the definitions of γ and wt in (3.2) and (3.3) that

                                hwγ, εi i = hγ, w−1 εi i = c(boxw−1 (i) ) = c(t(i)),
18                                                       arun ram

where t(i) is the box of t containing the entry i.
     In classical standard tableau theory the axial distance between two boxes in a standard tableau
is defined as follows. Let λ be a partition and let t be a standard tableau of shape λ. Let 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n
and let t(i) and t(j) be the boxes which are filled with i and j respectively. Let (ri , ci ) and (rj , cj )
be the positions of these boxes, where the rows and columns of λ are numbered in the same way
as for matrices. Then the axial distance from j to i in t is

                                                dji (t) = cj − ci + ri − rj ,

(see [Wz]). This may seem confusing at first but it is simpler if we rewrite it in terms of the
corresponding placed shape (γ, J ) where γ is the sequence in Rn determined by some placing of λ
on infinite graph paper. Then one gets

                        dji (t) = c(t(j)) − c(t(i)) = hwγ, εj − εi i = dεj −εi (w),

where w ∈ F (γ,J) is the permutation corresponding to the standard tableau t (see (3.2)) and dα (w)
is the generalized axial distance defined in (1.10). This shows that the axial distance defined in
(1.10) is a generalization of the classical notion of axial distance.

(4.2) Skew shapes.       The following proposition shows that, in the case of a root system of type
A, the definition of generalized skew shape coincides with the classical notion of a skew shape.

Proposition. Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape such that γ is dominant and integral. Then the
configuration of boxes associated to (γ, J ) is a placed skew shape if and only if (γ, J ) is a skew
shape as defined in (1.4).


Proof. ⇐=: We shall show that if the placed configuration corresponding to the pair (γ, J ) has any
2 × 2 blocks of the forms

that the placed configuration must be a placed skew shape if (γ, J ) is a generalized skew shape. In

since t(i) and t(i − 1) are on the same diagonal. It follows that wγ {α } is not regular.

then either i < j < k < ℓ or i < k < j < ℓ. In either case we have i < ℓ − 1 and it follows that
ℓ − 1 and ℓ are not on the same diagonal. Thus

and so wγ {α } is regular.
             ℓ
    The same argument shows that one can never get a standard tableau in which ℓ and ℓ − 2
occur in adjacent boxes of the same diagonal and thus it follows that wγ {α ,α } is regular for
                                                                                      ℓ−1   ℓ

all w ∈ F (γ,J) .
     Thus (γ, J ) is a placed skew shape in the sense of (1.4).



(4.3) Ribbon Shapes.        In classical tableaux theory a border strip (or ribbon) is a skew shape
which contains at most one box in each diagonal. Although the convention, [Mac, I §1 p. 5], is to
assume that border strips are connected skew shapes we shall not assume this.
     Recall from (1.5) that a placed shape (γ, J ) is a placed ribbon shape if γ is regular, i.e.
hγ, αi =
       6 0 for all α ∈ R.

Proposition. Let (γ, J ) be a placed ribbon shape such that γ is dominant and integral. Then
the configuration of boxes coresponding to (γ, J ) is a placed border strip.

Proof. Let (γ, J ) be a placed ribbon shape with γ dominant and regular. Since γ = (γ1 , . . . , γn )
is regular, γi 6= γj for all i 6= j. In terms of the placed configuration γi = c(boxi ) is the diagonal
that boxi is on. Thus the configuration of boxes corresponding to (γ, J ) contains at most one box
in each diagonal.

Example. If γ = (−6, −5, −4, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and J = {ε2 − ε1 , ε5 − ε4 , ε7 − ε6 , ε9 − ε8 , ε10 − ε9 }
then the placed configuration of boxes corresponding to (γ, J ) is the placed border strip

(4.4) Conjugation of Shapes.                  Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape with γ dominant and integral
(i.e. γ = (γ1 , . . . , γn ) with γ1 ≤ · · · ≤ γn and γi ∈ Z) and view (γ, J ) as a placed configuration
of boxes. In terms of placed configurations, conjugation of shapes is equivalent to transposing the
placed configuration across the diagonal of boxes of content 0. The following example illustrates
this.

Thus the configuration of boxes corresponding to the placed shape (γ, J )′ is

(4.5) Row reading and column reading tableaux.             Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape such that
γ is dominant and integral and consider the placed configuration of boxes corresponding to (γ, J ).
The minimal box of the configuration is the box such that
   (m1 ) there is no box immediately above,
   (m2 ) there is no box immediately to the left,
    (m3 ) there is no box northwest in the same diagonal, and
    (m4 ) it has the minimal content of the boxes satisfying (m1 ), (m2 ) and (m3 ).
There is at most one box in each diagonal satisfying (m1 ), (m2 ), and (m3 ). Thus, (m4 ) guarantees
that the minimal box is unique. It is clear that the minimal box of the configuration always exists.
     The column reading tableaux of shape (γ, J ) is the filling tmin which is created inductively by
 (a) filling the minimal box of the configuration with 1, and
(b) if 1, 2, . . . , i have been filled in then fill the minimal box of the configuration formed by the
     unfilled boxes with i + 1.

The row reading tableau of shape (γ, J ) is the standard tableau tmax whose conjugate (tmax )′ is the
column reading tableaux for the shape (γ, J )′ (the conjugate shape to (γ, J )).
    Recall the definitions of the weak Bruhat order and closed subsets of roots given in (1.11).

Theorem. Let (γ, J ) be a placed shape such that γ is dominant and integral (i.e. γ = (γ1 , . . . , γn )
with γ1 ≤ · · · ≤ γn and γi ∈ Z). Let tmin and tmax be the column reading and row reading tableaux
of shape (γ, J ), respectively, and let wmin and wmax be the corresponding permutations in F (γ,J) .
Then
                                                           c
      R(wmin ) = J,       R(wmax ) = (P (γ) \ J ) ∪ Z(γ) ,       and     F (γ,J) = [wmin , wmax ],

where K c denotes the complement of K in R+ and [wmin , wmax ] denotes the interval between wmin
and wmax in the weak Bruhat order.

Proof. (a) Consider the configuration of boxes corresponding to (γ, J ). If k > i then either
c(boxk ) > c(boxi ), or boxk is in the same diagonal and southeast of boxi . Thus when we create
tmin we have that

        If k > i then boxk gets filled before boxi if and only if boxk is northwest of boxi ,

where the northwest is in a very strong sense: There is a sequence of boxes

                              boxi = boxi0 , boxi1 , . . . , boxir = boxk

such that boxim is either directly above boxim−1 or in the same diagonal and directly northwest of
boxim−1 . In other words,

             If k > i then tmin (boxk ) < tmin (boxi )   ⇐⇒     boxk is northwest of boxi .

So, from the formula for wt in (3.2) we get

                       If k > i then wmin (k) < wmin (i)       ⇐⇒   εk − εi ∈ J,

where wmin is the permutation in F (γ,J) which corresponds to the filling tmin and J is the closure
of J in R. It follows that
                                          R(wmin ) = J .
                                                                                     c
    (b) There are at least two ways to prove that R(wmax ) = (P (γ) \ J ) ∪ Z(γ) . One can mimic
the proof of part (a) by defining the maximal box of a configuration and a corresponding filling.
Alternatively one can use the definition of conjugation and the fact that R(w0 w) = R(w)c . The
permutation wmin is the unique minimal element of F (γ,J) and the conjugate of wmax is the unique
                           ′
minimal element of F (γ,J) . We shall leave the details to the reader.
    (c) An element w ∈ W is an element of F (γ,J) if and only if R(w)∩P (γ) = J and R(w)∩Z(γ) =
∅. Thus F (γ,J) consists of those permutations w ∈ W such that
                                                                    c
                                   J ⊆ R(w) ⊆ (P (γ) \ J ) ∪ Z(γ) .

Since the weak Bruhat order is the ordering determined by inclusions of R(w), it follows that F (γ,J)
is the interval between wmin and wmax .

5. Standard tableaux for type C in terms of boxes


(5.1) The root system.           Let {ε1 , . . . , εn } be an orthonormal basis of Rn so that each sequence
                          n
                                                                   P
γ = (γ1 , . . . , γn ) ∈ R is identified with the vector γ = i γi εi . The root system of type Cn is
given by the sets

            R = {±2εi , εj ± εi | 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}                      and R+ = {2εi , εj − εi | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} .

The simple roots are given by α1 = 2ε1 , αi = εi − εi−1 , 2 ≤ i ≤ n. The Weyl group W = W Cn is
the hyperoctahedral group of permutations of −n, . . . , −1, 1, . . . , n such that w(−i) = −w(i). This
groups acts on the εi by the rule wεi = εw(i) , with the convention that ε−i = −εi .

(5.2) Rearranging γ.        The analysis in this case is analogous to the method that was used in
(3.7) to create books of placed configurations in the type A case. For clarity, we recommend that
the reader compare the machinations below with the case done in (3.7).
     Let γ ∈ Rn . By applying an element of the Weyl group to γ we can rearrange the entries of γ
in increasing order (0 ≤ γ1 ≤ γ2 ≤ · · · ≤ γn ). Then, if γi ∈ (x, x + 1/2) for some integer x, replace
γi with −γi . Next group the elements of γ in terms of their Z-cosets and rearrange each group to
be in increasing order. There are three kinds of groups which can occur:

   β + Cβ      =               (β + z1 , β + z2 , . . . , β + zk ),                           with β ∈ (x + 1/2, x + 1) for some x ∈ Z,
                                                                                                       zi ∈ Z≥0 and z1 ≤ . . . ≤ zk ,
     C0        =             (z1 ≤ z2 ≤ · · · ≤ zk ),                                         with zi ∈ Z≥0 and z1 ≤ . . . ≤ zk ,
1/2 + C1/2     =       (1/2 + z1 ≤ 1/2 + z2 ≤ · · · ≤ 1/2 + zk ),                             with zi ∈ Z≥0 and z1 ≤ . . . ≤ zk .

Choose some ordering on the groups and let

                                                       ~γ = (β1 + Cβ1 , . . . , βr + Cβr ).

Because these changes are obtained by applying elements of the Weyl group, the calibration graphs
corresponding to ~γ and the γ are the same. Thus it is sufficient to study the standard tableaux
corresponding to ~γ .

(5.3) Books of placed configurations.                      As in the type A case, we have set partitions
                                [                                    [
                       Z(~γ ) =   Zβi ,                    P (~γ ) =   Pβi , and,
                                         βi                        βi

for any J ⊆ P (~γ ),                          [
                                     J=            Jβi ,   where Jβi = J ∩ Pβi .
                                              βi

Each pair (β + Cβ , Jβ ) is a placed shape and we may identify (~γ , J ) with the book of placed shapes
                                   ((β1 + Cβ1 , Jβ1 ), . . . , (βr + Cβr , Jβr )) .
We think of this as a book with pages numbered by the values β1 , . . . , βr and with a placed
configuration determined by (βi + Cβi , Jβi ) on page βi . One determines the placed configurations
as follows.

(5.4) Page β, β 6= 12 , 0:   As in the type A case we will place boxes on a page of infinite graph
paper which has the diagonals numbered consecutively with the elements of Z, from bottom left
to top right. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, place boxi on diagonal ~γi − β. The boxes on each diagonal are
arranged in increasing order from top left to bottom right. Then
              Pβ = {εj − εi | j > i and boxi and boxj are in adjacent diagonals}                    and
              Zβ = {εj − εi | j > i and boxi and boxj are in the same diagonal} .
If Jβ ⊆ Pβ arrange the boxes on adjacent diagonals according to the rules
    (aβ ) if εj − εi ∈ Jr place boxj northwest of boxi , and
    (a′β ) if εj − εi ∈ Pr \Jr place boxj southeast of boxi .
A standard tableau t is a filling of the boxes with distinct entries from the set {−n, . . . , −1, 1, . . . , n}
such that if i appears then −i does not appear and
 (a) if j > i and boxj and boxi are in the same diagonal then t(boxi ) < t(boxj ),
(b) if j > i, boxi and boxj are in adjacent diagonals and boxj is northwest of boxi then t(boxi ) >
     t(boxj ),
 (c) if j > i, boxi and boxj are in adjacent diagonals and boxj is southeast of boxi then t(boxi ) <
     t(boxj ).

Example. Suppose β + Cβ = β + (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3) and
     Jβ = {ε4 − ε1 , ε4 − ε2 , ε4 − ε3 , ε5 − ε2 , ε5 − ε3 , ε7 − ε5 , ε7 − ε6 , ε8 − ε6 , ε10 − ε9 , ε10 − ε8 ,
             ε10 − ε7 , ε11 − ε9 , ε11 − ε8 , ε11 − ε7 , ε12 − ε9 } .

(5.6) Page 0:          We will place boxes on a page of infinite graph paper which has the diagonals
numbered consecutively with the elements of Z, from bottom left to top right. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n
such that ~γi ∈ C0 ,
 (1) place boxi on diagonal 0 if ~γi = 0, and
 (2) if ~γi 6= 0 place boxi on diagonal ~γi and box−i on diagonal −~γi .
The boxes on each diagonal are arranged in increasing order from top left to bottom right. With
this placing of boxes we have
                                                                                         
                    εj − εi , such that j > i and boxi and boxj are in adjacent diagonals
           P0 =                                                                             ,
                    εj + εi , such that boxj is in diagonal 1 and boxi is in diagonal 0
                                                                                         
                  εj − εi , such that j > i and boxi and boxj are in the same diagonal 
           Z0 = εj + εi , such that j > i and boxj and boxi are in diagonal 0               .
                      2εi ,   such that boxi is in diagonal 0
                                                                                         

If J0 ⊆ P0 then arrange the boxes on adjacent diagonals according to:
    (a0 ) if εj − εi ∈ J0 place boxj northwest of boxi and if boxi is not on diagonal 0 place box−i
            northwest of box−j ,
        ′
    (a0 ) if εj − εi ∈ P0 \J0 place boxj southeast of boxi and if boxi is not on diagonal 0 place
            box−i southeast of box−j ,
     (b0 ) if εj + εi ∈ J0 place boxi northwest of box−j ,
     (b′0 ) if εj + εi ∈ P0 \J0 place boxi southeast of box−j .
A standard tableau t is a filling of the boxes with distinct entries from the set {−n, . . . , −1, 1, . . . , n}
such that
                        t(boxi ) = −t(box−i ), if boxi is not on the zero diagonal,
                             t(boxi ) > 0,       if boxi is on the zero diagonal,
and
 (a) if j > i and boxj and boxi are in the same diagonal then t(boxi ) < t(boxj ),
(b) if j > i, boxi and boxj are in adjacent diagonals and boxj is northwest of boxi then t(boxi ) >
     t(boxj ),
 (c) if j > i, boxi and boxj are in adjacent diagonals and boxj is southeast of boxi then t(boxi ) <
     t(boxj ).

Example. Suppose C0 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2) and
      J0 = {ε4 − ε1 , ε4 − ε2 , ε4 − ε3 , ε5 − ε1 , ε5 − ε2 , ε5 − ε3 , ε6 − ε1 , ε6 − ε2 , ε6 − ε3 , ε7 − ε6 ,
              ε6 + ε1 , ε5 + ε1 , ε5 + ε2 , ε4 + ε1 , ε4 + ε2 } .
The placed configuration of boxes corresponding to (C0 , J0 ) is as given below.
             1                                  4                                 -6

(5.7)         Using the above rules one produces a book of placed configurations corresponding to
(~γ , J ) = ((β1 + Cβ1 , Jβ1 ), . . . , (βr + Cβr , Jβr )). A standard tableau t for this book of configurations
is a filling of the boxes with distinct elements of {−n, . . . , −1, 1, . . . , n} such that the filling on each
page satisfies the conditions for a standard tableau for that page. Let

                                            F ((Cβ1 ,Jβ1 ),...,(Cβr ,Jβr ))

denote the set of such fillings.
    The proof of the following Theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem (3.5).

Theorem. Given a standard tableau t for the book of configurations ((Cβ1 , Jβ1 ), . . . , (Cβr , Jβr ))
define wt ∈ W Cn by wt (i) = t(boxi ). Then the map

                                  F ((Cβ1 ,Jβ1 ),...,(Cβr ,Jβr ))   ←→ F (~γ ,J)
                                                t                   7−→  wt

is a bijection.
