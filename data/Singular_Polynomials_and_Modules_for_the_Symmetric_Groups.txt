                                                      Abstract. For certain negative rational numbers κ0 , called singular values,
                                                      and associated with the symmetric group SN on N objects, there exist homo-
                                                      geneous polynomials annihilated by each Dunkl operator when the parameter
                                                      κ = κ0 . It was shown by de Jeu, Opdam and the author (Trans. Amer.
                                                      Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 237-256) that the singular values are exactly the
                                                      values − mn
                                                                   with 2 ≤ n ≤ N , m = 1, 2, . . . and m     n

                                                      each pair (m, n) satisfying these conditions there is a unique irreducible SN -
                                                      module of singular polynomials for the singular value − m    n
                                                                                                                     . The existence of
                                                      these polynomials was previously established by the author (IMRN 2004, #67,
                                                      3607-3635). The uniqueness is proven in the present paper. By using Mur-

                                                      elements, the problem of existence of singular polynomials is first restricted
                                                      to the isotype τ (where τ is a partition of N corresponding to an irreducible
                                                      representation of SN ) satisfying the condition that n/ gcd (m, n) divides τi + 1

                                                      involving the analysis of nonsymmetric Jack polynomials it is shown that the
                                                      assumption τ2 ≥ n/ gcd (m, n) leads to a contradiction. This shows that the
                                                      singular polynomials are exactly those already determined, and are of isotype
                                                      τ , where τ2 = . . . = τl−1 = (n/ gcd (m, n)) − 1 ≥ τl .

certain singularity property with respect to a commutative algebra of differential-
difference operators. In a previous paper [2] the author established the existence of
a space of such polynomials for each pair (m, n). This paper proves the uniqueness
of the polynomials and the associated modules. By use of the Murphy elements one
can find a link between the singular polynomials, the partition of N which labels
the module and the nonsymmetric Jack polynomials (NSJP’s). This is the family
of simultaneous eigenvectors of a commuting set {Ui (κ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } of operators
(involving a parameter κ). The singular polynomials come from the specializations
of certain of NSJP’s when κ takes the value − m       n . The algebra generated by the
Ui (κ) is semisimple (that is, the set of NSJP’s forms a basis for all polynomials)
for generic κ, but this property may be lost for some negative rational values. A
part of the development is to show how to find limits of certain expressions in the
NSJP’s as κ approaches − m    n.
   Murphy [9] found the eigenvalues of the Murphy elements when restricted to any
irreducible SN -module. In Section 2 we use his results to find a necessary condition
on a partition to allow corresponding singular polynomials and also to prove a
uniqueness result. The condition is this: suppose gcd (m, n) = 1 and there is an
SN -module of singular polynomials corresponding to κ = − m            n,P and suppose the
module is labeled by the partition τ (that is, τ = (τ1 , τ2 , . . .) with i≥1 τi = N and
τ1 ≥ τ2 ≥ . . . ≥ 0) then n| (τi + 1) for 1 ≤ i < ℓ (τ ), where ℓ (τ ) = max {j : τj ≥ 1}).
Section 3 develops the relevant results on NSJP’s. In Section 4 it is shown that the
two-part partitions of the form (N − n, n) with n| (N − n + 1) can not give rise to
singular polynomials. Section 5 completes the proof of the main result: if τ2 ≥ n
then there can not be corresponding singular polynomials. This shows that the
class of partitions, namely, τ with n| (τ1 + 1) and τ2 = τ3 = . . . = τℓ(τ )−1 = n − 1,
appearing in [2] is exhaustive. In Section 6 there is a restatement of the main
theorem and a discussion of the relation between singular polynomials and modules
over the rational Cherednik algebra.
   The group SN is the finite reflection group of type AN −1 and it acts by permuta-
tion of coordinates. Let N0 denote {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .} (also N : = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, Z and Q

sider elements of SN as permutations on {1, 2, . . . , N }. Then, for x ∈ RN and
w ∈ SN let (xw)i = xw(i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N and extend this action to polynomials by
(wf ) (x) = f (xw). This has the effect that monomials transform to monomials:
w (xα ) = xwα where (wα)i = αw−1 (i) for α ∈ NN         0 . (Consider x as a row vector,
α as a column vector, and w as a permutation matrix, with 1’s at the (w (j) , j)
entries.) The reflections in SN are the transpositions interchanging xi and xj and
are denoted by (i, j) for i 6= j.
   In [1] the author constructed for each finite reflection group a parametrized com-
mutative algebra of differential-difference operators. Let κ be a formal parameter,
that is, Q (κ) is a transcendental extension of Q.

   For the symmetric group SN the operators are defined as follows:

Definition 2. For any polynomial f on RN and 1 ≤ i ≤ N let

                                       ∂            X f (x) − (ij) f (x)
                   Di (κ) f (x) =         f (x) + κ                      .
                                      ∂xi                  xi − xj
                                                   j6=i


   It was shown in [1] that Di (κ) Dj (κ) = Dj (κ) Di (κ) for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N and
each Di (κ) maps Pn to Pn−1 for n ≥ 1. A specific numerical parameter value
κ0 is said to be a singular value (associated with SN ) if there exists a nonzero
polynomial p such that Di (κ0 ) p = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N : such a p is called a singular
polynomial. It was shown in [4] that the singular values are the numbers − m      n
where n = 2, . . . , N, m ∈ N and m n ∈/ Z. Earlier, Opdam [10] showed that the
SN -Bessel function J (x, y) considered as a function of the parameter κ has poles
precisely at these numbers (for κ > 0 the Bessel function is!the entire solution

N, J (0, y) = 1, J (xw, y) = J (x, yw) = J (x, y) for x, y ∈ CN ). Because the
operators Di (κ) preserve homogeneity and have the SN -transformation property
Di (κ) (i, j) = (i, j) Dj (κ), the set of singular polynomials for a specific singular
value is a direct sum of irreducible SN -modules of homogeneous polynomials. The
set of partitions of length ≤ N is denoted by NN,P  0        and consists of all λ ∈ NN 0 such
that λi ≥ λi+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1. When writing partitions it is customary to
suppress
        trailing zeros and to use exponents to indicate multiplicity, for example
  5, 23 is the same as (5, 2, 2, 2, 0) ∈ N5,P
                                           0 . (The exponent notation is also used for
compositions.)
    The irreducible representations of SN are labeled by partitions τ of N (that is,
τ ∈ NN,P
       0    and |τ | = N ) and we say a polynomial f is of isotype τ if f is an element
of an irreducible SN -submodule of Pn corresponding to τ . It was conjectured
in [4] that the two-part representations (n − 1, N − n + 1) (with 2 (n − 1) ≥ N )
give rise to singular polynomials for the singular values − m            n with gcd (m, n) <
    n
N −n+1   , and the  representations   (dn − 1, n − 1, . . . , n − 1, τl for d, n ∈ N give rise
                                                                       )
to singular polynomials for the singular values − m          n  with   gcd (m, n) = 1 (where
l = ℓ (τ ) and N = (dn − 1) + (l − 2) (n − 1) + τl ). This construction is presented in
[2] in terms of nonsymmetric Jack polynomials. In this paper we show that there are
no other singular polynomials. By using Murphy’s techniques in his construction
of the Young seminormal representations [9] we can show that the isotype τ of any
irreducible module of singular polynomials for κ0 = − m         n (with gcd (m, n) = 1) must
satisfy n| (τi + 1) for 1 ≤ i < ℓ (τ ). After that most of the work is to show that the
assumption τ2 ≥ n leads to a contradiction. Note that the condition τ2 < n implies
for three or more parts τi = n − 1 for 2 ≤ i < ℓ (τ ) (and τℓ(τ ) ≤ n − 1) and for two
                         τ1 + 1
parts that τ2 <                       = n for the singular value − τm        1
                                                                           1 +1
                                                                                . These are the
                    gcd (m1 , τ1 + 1)
restrictions described above.
    The notation is almost the same as that in [2] except that the parameter has
been incorporated. Key parts of the proofs depend on the behavior of polynomials
as κ approaches a singular value κ0 . The commutative algebra of the operators

act in a triangular manner on monomials, as is explained below.

                        0 , let α denote the unique partition such that α = wα
                                N
for some w ∈ SN . For α, β ∈ N0 the partial order α ≻ β (α dominates β) means
                Pj        Pj
that α 6= β and i=1 αi ≥ i=1 βi for 1 ≤ j ≤ N ; α ⊲ β means that |α| = |β| and
either α+ ≻ β + or α+ = β + and α ≻ β. The notations α  β and α D β include
the case α = β.
   When acting on the monomial basis of Pn the operators Ui (κ) have on-diagonal
coefficients involving the following rank function on NN
                                                       0 . We denote the cardinality
of a set E by #E.
Definition 4. For α ∈ NN

               r (α, i) = # {j : αj > αi } + # {j : 1 ≤ j ≤ i, αj = αi } ,
              ξi (α; κ) = (N − r (α, i)) κ + αi + 1.

   Clearly for a fixed α ∈ NN      0 the values {r (α, i) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } consist of all of
{1, . . . , N }, are independent of trailing zeros (that is, if α′ ∈ NM        ′
                                                                          0 , αi = αi for

1 ≤ i ≤ N and αi = 0 for N < i ≤ M then r (α, i) = r (α , i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N ),
and α ∈ NN,P    0   if and only if r (α, i) = i for all i (the latter property motivated
the use of “1 ≤ j ≤ i” rather than “1 ≤ j < i” in the definition). Then (see [5,
p.291]) Ui (κ) xα = ξi (α; κ) xα + qα,i (x) where qα,i (x) is a sum of terms ±κxβ with
α ⊲ β. The nonsymmetric Jack polynomials are the simultaneous eigenvectors of
{Ui (κ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } and they are well-defined for generic κ.

                                   2. SN -modules
    In this section we find necessary conditions on a partition τ of N for the existence
of singular polynomials of isotype τ . Suppose f is a singular polynomial for some
singular value κ0 . We may assume f is homogeneous because the operators Di (κ)
are homogeneous and that f has rational coefficients (Di (κ0 ) is a rational operator).
Any translate of f by SN is singular so spanQ {wf : w ∈ SN } is an SN -module of
singular polynomials for κ0 . Suppose one of the irreducible components has isotype
τ , for some partition τ with |τ | = N . This decomposition is a computation over
Q (from the representation theory of SN ). Henceforth we restrict our attention to
this module, denoted by M .
    We turn to the application of Murphy’s results. For any given isotype he de-
termined the eigenvalues nPand transformation properties

commuting operators          j=1 (i, j) : 2 ≤ i ≤ N   (Jucys-Murphy  elements). The re-
sults have to be read in reverse in a certain sense.
Proposition 1. Suppose f is a singular polynomial for κ = κ0 ∈ Q and 1 ≤ i ≤ N ,
                        P
then Ui (κ0 ) f = f + κ0 Nj=i+1 (i, j) f .

Proof. We have the commutation Di (κ) (xi f ) = xi Di (κ) f + f + κ j6=i (i, j) f .

standard Young tableau (SYT) of shape τ is a one-to-one

{1, . . . , N } to the nodes of the Ferrers diagram (i, j) ∈ N2 : 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ (τ ) , 1 ≤ j ≤ τi
so that the entries increase in each row and in each column. The notation T (i, j)
refers to the entry at row i, column j. There is an order on SYT’s of given shape
(for details see [9, p.288]) and the maximum SYT in this order, denoted by T0 , is
produced by entering the numbers 1, 2, . . . , N row by row (the first row is 1, . . . , τ1 ,
the second is τ1 + 1, . . . , τ1 + τ2 and so forth).
Definition 5. Let τ ∈ NN,P  0   with |τ | = N , and let Y (τ ) denote the set of SYT’s
of shape τ . Suppose T ∈ Y (τ ) then let rw (i, T ) , cm (i, T ) , ηi (T ) := cm (i, T ) −
rw (i, T ) denote the row, column and content, respectively of the node of T contain-
ing i, for 1 ≤ i ≤ N .
    (With this notation T (rw (i, T ) , cm (i, T )) = i.) Murphy constructed a basis
{fT : T ∈ Y (τ )} for the irreducible representation of isotype τ such that ωi fT =
ηi (T ) fT for each i and T (actually, this is an isomorphic image of the construction,
which is in terms of specific polynomials, of minimal degree). The eigenvalues
(η1 (T ) , . . . , ηN (T )) determine the SYT T uniquely thus there is a unique (up to
scalar multiplication) basis {fT : T ∈ Y (τ )} for M with
          Ui (κ0 ) fT = (1 + κ0 ηN +1−i (T )) fT , for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, T ∈ Y (τ ) .
(The argument for uniqueness of T is in [9]: one can reconstruct T by adjoining
boxes containing 2, 3, . . . , N to 1 by using the values η2 (T ) , . . . , ηN (T ); at any
stage the locations at which one can adjoin a box to make a P           larger SYT have
different contents.) We will show that fT0 is (a multiple of) xλ + β⊳λ Aβ xβ with
coefficients Aβ ∈ Q and λ ∈ NN,P  0   with
                                 s−1

                                                                         X

This implies that if κ0 = − m   n with gcd (m, n) = 1 then n| (τj + 1) for 1 ≤ j <
ℓ (τ ) (the maximum value for s in the above formula). The proof relies on the
triangularity properties of the Ui (κ0 ) with respect to the order ⊲.

Definition 6. For each T ∈ Y (τ ) let CT = β ∈ NN      0 : coef (fT , β) 6= 0 . Let C be
the set of α ∈ ∪T ∈Y (τ ) CT such that α is ⊲-maximal in some CT (that is, α, β ∈ CT
and β D α implies β = α).
Lemma 1. If α is a ⊲-maximal element of C then α is a partition.
Proof. It suffices to show that for any β ∈ ∪T CT there exists a partition λ ∈ C
with λ D β. Since M = spanQ {fT : T ∈ Y (τ )} is SN -invariant we see that for any
w ∈ SN and β ∈ CT for some T there    exists T1 ∈ Y (τ ) such that wβ ∈ CT1 (note
that wfT (x) = fT (xw) and w xβ = xwβ ). So ∪T CT is SN -invariant, in particular

if β ∈ ∪T CT then β + ∈ ∪T CT . Thus there exists γ ∈ C such that γ D β + . Since
C is finite the maximal elements α satisfy α D α+ , that is, α is a partition. 

  The next step is to show that there is a unique maximal element in C determined
by equation 2.1.
Lemma 2. If T ∈ Y (τ ) satisfies ηs+1 (T ) ≤ ηs (T ) + 1 for 1 ≤ s < N then T = T0 .
Proof. We have to show that the condition implies rw (s, T ) ≤ rw (s + 1, T ) for
each s. Fix s and let T (i1 , j1 ) = s and T (i2 , j2 ) = s + 1 so that ηs (T ) − ηs+1 (T ) =
(j1 − j2 )+(i2 − i1 ). We list the possibilities for these nodes in any SYT. If s and s+1
are in the same row of T then i2 = i1 , j2 = j1 + 1 and ηs+1 (T ) = ηs (T )+ 1. If s and
s+ 1 are in the same column of T then i2 = i1 + 1, j2 = j1 and ηs+1 (T ) = ηs (T )− 1.
The condition i1 < i2 and j1 < j2 is impossible or else s < T (i2 , j1 ) < s + 1. Also
the condition i1 > i2 and j1 > j2 is impossible or else s + 1 < T (i1 , j2 ) < s. If
i1 < i2 and j1 > j2 then ηs (T ) − ηs+1 (T ) ≥ 2. The case i1 > i2 and j1 < j2 is
ruled out by hypothesis because it implies ηs (T ) − ηs+1 (T ) ≤ −2.                        

Theorem 1. Suppose λ is a ⊲-maximal element of C then λ is ⊲-maximal in CT0
and is given by equation 2.1.
Proof. By hypothesis λ is a partition and is ⊲-maximal in CT for some T ∈ Y (τ ).
By the triangularity property of Ui (κ0 ) we have that
                 coef ((1 + κ0 ηN +1−i (T )) fT , λ) = coef (Ui (κ0 ) fT , λ)
                                                     = ξi (λ; κ0 ) coef (fT , λ) ,
and ξi (λ; κ0 ) = (N − i) κ0 + λi + 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . This gives the equations
                          (N − i) κ0 + λi + 1 = 1 + κ0 ηN +1−i (T ) ,
                                      λN +1−i = κ0 (ηi (T ) + 1 − i) .
Since λ is a partition λN +1−i ≤ λN −i for 1 ≤ i < N and thus ηi (T ) + 1 − i ≥
ηi+1 (T ) + 1 − (i + 1) (note that κ0 < 0). By Lemma 2 T = T0 . By definition
of T0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ τ1 we have ηi (T0 ) = i − 1 thus      λP        = 0. In the range

and n| (τj + 1) for 1 ≤ j < ℓ (τ ) (where κ0 = − m

maximum value of s is ℓ (τ ).                                                                      

Corollary 2. For any κ0 = − m    n and partition τ of N there is at most one ir-

Proof. Suppose there are two unequal modules M and M ′ satisfying the hypotheses.
Let {fT : T ∈ Y (τ )} and {fT′ : T ∈ Y (τ )} be the respective bases for M and M ′
produced by Murphy’s construction. Normalize     P the two bases so that both fT0
and fT′ 0 are monic in xλ (that is, fT0 = xλ + β⊳λ Aβ xβ and fT′ 0 has the same
form with Aβ replaced by A′β ), with λ given by equation 2.1. Let gT = fT − fT′
for T ∈ Y (τ ), then spanQ {gT : T ∈ Y (τ )} consists of singular polynomials and its
basis has the same transformation properties under the action of SN as the basis
of M . By the Theorem coef (gT0 , λ) 6= 0, which is a contradiction.               


   The following summarizes the results of this section. The polynomial fT0 is
renamed gλ .

equation 2.1.




                      3. Nonsymmetric Jack polynomials
   These polynomials are the simultaneous eigenvectors of the commuting set of
operators {Ui (κ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } . The existence follows from the triangular property
and the fact that the correspondence (from compositions to eigenvalues) α 7−→
           N
(ξi (α; κ))i=1 is one-to-one for generic κ. We use the notation from [2] (for now
just the x-monic version is used but there will be a reference to the p-monic version).

There is another invariant subspace structure for {Ui (κ)} besides the ⊲-triangular
property. The purpose of the following arguments is to allow the computation of
certain coefficients of ζαx (κ) crucial in the arguments of Section 5.

                

Proof. Let α ∈ Is,n . It suffices to show Bij xα ∈ Ps,n for all i, j. By formulae 3.1-
3.4 this is obvious for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ s or s + 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N , or max (αi , αj ) < n. Only the
two cases 1 ≤ i ≤ s, αj = n (thus j > s) and 1 ≤ j ≤ s, αi = n (with i > s) remain
                                                                                  (N )
to be considered. Formulae 3.3 and 3.2 respectively show that Bij xα ∈ Ps,n . For
            N                    x                                    α
any α ∈ N0 the eigenvector ζα (κ) is contained in the orbit of x under the algebra
                                         (N )                    (N )
generated by {Ui (κ)} hence xα ∈ Ps,n implies ζαx (κ) ∈ Ps,n . That the span of
                     (N )
{ζαx (κ)} is all of Ps,n follows easily (dimension argument, for example).              

   The definition is only interesting when α ∈ Is,n where n = λℓ(λ) , in which
case the following rank equations hold: let β = ι (s; λ) α and k = ℓ (λ), then
r (β, i) = r (α, i) + k for 1 ≤ i ≤ s, r (β, i) = r (α, i − k) + k for s + k < i ≤ N + k,
and r (β, i) = i − s for s + 1 ≤ i ≤ s + k.

    It suffices to prove this for ℓ (λ) = 1 because then one can insert one part of λ at

note the operator Ui (κ) for M variables. For M > N let πMN be the projection
from P (M) onto P (N ) defined by setting xN +1 = xN +2 = . . . = xM = 0. The
coefficients of the ζαx do not depend on the number of variables (that is coef (ζαx , β)
is independent of N ≥ max (ℓ (α) , ℓ (β))) because of the intertwining relation

   We show that if α ∈ Is,n then ιs,n ζαx (κ) is congruent to ζι(s,(n))α (κ) modulo the
               (N +1)
subspace Ps+1,n . To illustrate the argument, suppose there is a linear operator
V with an invariant subspace E and there is a vector f and number c so that
                                   −1
Vf −cf ∈ E then f −((V − c) |E ) (Vf − cf ) is an eigenvector of V with eigenvalue
c, provided that the restriction of V − c to E is invertible. This can be adapted for
simultaneous eigenvectors of pairwise commuting operators by extending the base
field Q (κ), adjoining another formal variable (transcendental) v and considering
                    PN        (N )        PN +1      (N +1)
just one operator i=1 v i Ui (κ) (or i=1 v i Ui             (κ), as appropriate). The

eigenvalues i=1 v ξi (α; κ) are simple (α ∈ N0 and generic κ). Denote the field
Q (κ, v) by K.

Proof. By definition coef (ζαx (κ) , γ) = coef (ιs,n ζαx (κ) , ι (s, (n)) γ). Also
                                                                              (N +1)
(ι (s, (n)) γ)s+1 = n and thus coef (f, ι (s, (n)) γ) = 0 for any f ∈ Ps+1,n .                      

   This completes the proof of Theorem 3.
   The poles of the coefficients of ζαx (κ) play a key role in the analysis of singu-
lar polynomials. Knop and Sahi [8] found an algorithm for the evaluation of the
coefficients. It uses the idea of extending the definition of Ferrers diagrams to com-
positions and associating a hook-length to each node in the diagram. The Ferrers
diagram of a composition α ∈ NN       0 is the set {(i, j) : 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ (α) , 0 ≤ j ≤ αi } .

For each node (i, j) with 1 ≤ j ≤ αi there are two special subsets of the Fer-
rers diagram, the arm {(i, l) : j < l ≤ αi } and the leg {(l, j) : l > i, j ≤ αl ≤ αi } ∪
{(l, j − 1) : l < i, j − 1 ≤ αl < αi }. The node itself, the arm and the leg make up
the hook. The definition of hooks for compositions is from [8, p.15]. The cardinality
of the leg is called the leg-length, formalized by the following:
Definition 11. For α ∈ NN
                        0 , 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ (α) and 1 ≤ j ≤ αi the leg-length is

                      L (α; i, j) := # {l : l > i, j ≤ αl ≤ αi }
                                 + # {l : l < i, j ≤ αl + 1 ≤ αi } .
For t ∈ Q (κ) the hook-length and the hook-length product for α are given by
                        h (α, t; i, j) = (αi − j + t + κL (α; i, j))
                                         ℓ(α) αi
                                         YY
                            h (α, t) =             h (α, t; i, j) ,
                                         i=1 j=1

   Note that the indices {i : αi = 0} are omitted in the product h (α, t). In [2] and
[5] we used the notation
              Y                       εκ
                                                                         
     Eε (α) =     1+                                     : i < j, αi < αj , ε = ±.
                       κ (r (α, i) − r (α, j)) + αj − αi
The denominator also equals ξj (α; κ) − ξi (α; κ). The relation to h (α, t) (for the
values t = 1, κ + 1 which are of concern here) is the following:
                                                                                 h (α+ , 1)
Lemma 5. For α ∈ NN                      +
                  0 , h (α, κ + 1) = h (α , κ + 1) E+ (α) and h (α, 1) =                    .
                                                                                  E− (α)
Proof. We use induction on adjacent transpositions. The statements are true for
α = α+ . Fix α+ and suppose αi > αi+1 for some i. Let σ = (i, i + 1). Con-
                   h (σα, t)
sider the ratio              . The only node whose hook-length changes (in the sense
                    h (α, t)
of interchanging rows i and i + 1 of the Ferrers diagram) is (i, αi+1 + 1). Explic-
itly h (σα, t; s, j) = h (α, t; s, j) for s 6= i, i + 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ αs , h (σα, t; i, j) =
h (α, t; i + 1, j) for 1 ≤ j ≤ αi+1 and h (σα, t; i + 1, j) = h (α, t; i, j) for 1 ≤ j ≤ αi
                                       h (σα, t)     h (σα, t; i + 1, αi+1 + 1)
except for j = αi+1 + 1. Thus                     =                             . Note that
                                        h (α, t)        h (α, t; i, αi+1 + 1)
L (σα; i + 1, αi+1 + 1) = L (α; i, αi+1 + 1) + 1 (the node (i, αi+1 ) is adjoined to the
leg). Let
            E1 = {s : s ≤ i, αs ≥ αi } ∪ {s : s > i, αs > αi } ,
            E2 = {s : s ≤ i + 1, αs ≥ αi+1 } ∪ {s : s > i + 1, αs > αi+1 } ,
thus by definition r (α, i) = #E1 and r (α, i + 1) = #E2 . Now E1 ⊂ E2 thus
r (α, i + 1) − r (α, i) = # (E2 \E1 ) and E2 \E1 = {s : s < i, αi > αs ≥ αi+1 } ∪ {i} ∪
{s : s > i + 1, αi ≥ αs > αi+1 }. This shows that # (E2 \E1 ) = 1+L (α; i, αi+1 + 1) ,
and
          h (α, t; i, αi+1 + 1) = κ (r (α, i + 1) − r (α, i) − 1) + t + αi − αi+1 − 1,
    h (σα, t; i + 1, αi+1 + 1) = κ (r (α, i + 1) − r (α, i)) + t + αi − αi+1 − 1.

Thus
       h (σα, κ + 1; i + 1, αi+1 + 1)   κ (r (α, i + 1) − r (α, i) + 1) + αi − αi+1
                                      =
          h (α, κ + 1; i, αi+1 + 1)       κ (r (α, i + 1) − r (α, i)) + αi − αi+1
                                                                 κ

                                      = E+ (σα) /E+ (α) ;
the latter equation is proven in Theorem 8.5.8,from [5, p.302], and
       h (σα, 1; i + 1, αi+1 + 1)     κ (r (α, i + 1) − r (α, i)) + αi − αi+1
                                  =
          h (α, 1; i, αi+1 + 1)     κ (r (α, i + 1) − r (α, i) − 1) + αi − αi+1
                                                                                 −1
                                                               κ
                                  = 1−
                                          κ (r (α, i + 1) − r (α, i)) + αi − αi+1
                                  = E− (α) /E− (σα) .
Thus h (α, κ + 1) and h (α+ , κ + 1) E+ (α) have the same transformation properties
                                                                        h(α+ ,1)
under adjacent transpositions and hence are equal. Similarly h (α, 1) = E− (α) . 
    Knop and Sahi [8, Theorem 5.1] showed that h (α, κ + 1) ζαx (κ) has all coef-
ficients in N0 [κ] for each α ∈ NN  0 . When κ takes on a negative rational num-
ber κ0 it may happen that two different compositions have the same eigenvalues
             N
(ξi (α; κ0 ))i=1 so one can not claim the existence of a basis of simultaneous eigen-
vectors of {Ui (κ0 ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N }. We recall the following from [2].
                                N
Definition 12. Let α, β ∈ N0 and let m, n ∈ N with gcd (m, n) = 1 then say (α, β)
is a − mn  -critical pair (for α) if α ⊲ β and (nκ + m) divides (r (β, i) − r (α, i)) κ+
αi − βi (in Q [κ]) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N .
                                                    
   The definition implies ξi α; − m                m
                                      n = ξi β; − n for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . We can deduce
the existence of simple poles at κ = − m  n in a certain coefficient.

Lemma 6. Suppose α, β ∈ NN      0 , h (α, κ + 1) has a simple zero at κ0 ∈ Q and (α, β)
is the unique κ0 -critical pair for α, then coef (ζαx (κ) , β) has a simple pole at κ0 .
Proof. Since coef (ζαx (κ) , β) is independent of the number of variables N provided
                                                                              
N ≥ max (ℓ (α) , ℓ (β)) we may assume N = ℓ (α) + |α|. Let γ = 0ℓ(α) , 1|α| ∈ NN      0
then by [8] coef (ζαx (κ) , γ) = (|α|)!κ|α| /h (α, κ + 1). Let f = lim (κ − κ0 ) ζαx (κ)
                                                                    κ→κ0
which exists as a polynomial over Q by hypothesis and is not zero because
lim (κ − κ0 ) coef (ζαx (κ) , γ) 6= 0. The polynomial f is a simultaneous eigen-
κ→κ0
vector for {Ui (κ0 ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } because Ui (κ0 ) f = lim (κ − κ0 ) Ui (κ) ζαx (κ) =
                                                           κ→κ0                 	
ξi (α; κ0 ) f . Let γ be a ⊲-maximal element of δ ∈ NN       0 : coef (f, δ) 6= 0 . By ⊲-
triangularity ξi (α; κ0 ) = ξi (δ; κ0 ) for each i, thus δ = α or δ = β by definition of
critical pairs. It is impossible for δ = α since coef (f, α) = lim (κ − κ0 ) = 0 hence
                                                                 κ→κ0
δ = β. So coef (f, β) = lim (κ − κ0 ) coef (ζαx (κ) , β) 6= 0.                          

     In the next sections the Lemma will be combined with Theorem 3.
Example 1. The conceptual proof of the Lemma may be the only reasonably ef-
fective method.

There is a combinatorial formula for the coefficients of ζαx (κ) due to Knop and
Sahi [8], which requires a sum over 3! × 1721 configurations for this example (the
factorial comes from permuting the indices (3, 4, 5)). By direct (computer algebra)
calculations this coefficient equals
                       30κ3 (1 + κ)2 (62κ3 + 135κ2 + 78κ + 40)
                                                                    .
                   (2κ + 3)(2κ + 5)(κ + 2)2 (κ + 3)2 (κ + 4)(κ + 5)
The expression suggests that there is no practical closed form.
   We address the problem of the relationship of a simultaneous eigenvector of
{Ui (κ0 ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } to the nonsymmetric Jack polynomials; namely, how can such
                                                                                       m
a polynomial be expressed as a limit as κ → κ0 ? For a given α ∈ NN     0 and κ0 = − n
let C (α, κ0 ) = {β : (α, β) is a κ0 -critical pair}. In the proof we again use the field
                                   PN
K = Q (κ, v) and the operator i=1 v i Ui (κ); otherwise to each γ ∈ E one has to
associate some i for which ξi (α; κ0 ) 6= ξi (γ; κ0 ). The expressions we consider are
all rational in κ (now with values in Q (v)) so having no pole at κ0 is equivalent to
being analytic in a neighborhood of κ0 .
Theorem 4. Suppose for some α ∈ NN            and κ0 = − m   n that there exists a si-
                                     P 0
multaneous eigenvector gα = x + β⊳α Aβ xβ of {Ui (κ0 ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N }, with the
                                α

coefficients Aβ ∈ Q, then there are coefficientsn Bβ (κ) ∈ K defined for β ∈ C o (α, κ0 )

                                            P            x
such that the polynomial qα (κ) = ζα (κ) +       Bβ (κ) ζβ (κ) : β ∈ C (α, κ0 ) has no
pole at κ0 and lim qα (κ) = gα .
                κ→κ0

Proof. By the triangularity property Ui (κ0 ) gα = ξi (α; κ0 ) gα . P   For generic κ there
are coefficients Bγ′ (κ) defined for all γ ⊳ α so that gα = ζαx (κ)+ γ⊳α Bγ′ (κ) ζγx (κ)
(because the nonsymmetric Jack polynomials form a basis and the change-of-basis
matrix is unimodular and triangular). Let E = {γ : γ ⊳ α, γ ∈         / C (α, κ0 )}. Apply
the operator
                               Y         PN i
                                           i=1 v (Ui (κ) − ξi (γ; κ))

to both sides of the equation for gα , thus annihilating all ζγx (κ) with γ ∈ E. The
right hand side becomes

with the last equation implicitly defining the coefficients Bβ (κ).We use the opera-
tors Bi from Definition 8. To evaluate V (κ) gα directly we consider

Thus for each γ ∈ E we have
  PN i                                               PN i
    i=1 v (Ui (κ) − ξi (γ; κ))                             v (r (α, i) − N + Bi )

   i=1 v (ξi (α; κ) − ξi (γ; κ))                      i=1 v (ξi (α; κ) − ξi (γ; κ))
The latter term has no pole at κ0 , since (α, γ) is not a κ0 -critical pair. Apply
this computation repeatedly to obtain V (κ) gα = gα + (κ − κ0 ) p (κ), where p is
polynomial in x, rational in κ and has no pole at κ0 . Hence set qα (κ) = V (κ) gα ,
then lim qα (κ) = gα , and this completes the proof.                             

               V (κ) gλ = ζλx (κ) +     Bβ (κ) ζβx (κ) : β ∈ C (λ, κ0 ) ,
which has no pole at κ0 . More importantly, since Di (κ) is polynomial in κ, the
relation lim Di (κ) V (κ) gλ = Di (κ0 ) gλ = 0 holds. This is a key ingredient in the
           κ→κ0
proof that τ2 < n, because we can now apply the known formulae for Di (κ) ζβx (κ).
   The basic step is the formula for Dℓ(α) (κ) ζαx (κ) for α ∈ NN
                                                                0 . The computation
                                                        N
involves a cyclic shift. For 1 ≤ i ≤ N let ε (i) ∈ N0 denote the standard basis
element, that is, ε (i)j = δij .
Definition 13. For 1 < k ≤ N let θk = (1, 2) (2, 3) . . . (k − 1, k) ∈ SN , (thus,
θk α = (αk , α1 , . . . , αk−1 , αk+1 , . . .) for α ∈ NN            N
                                                        0 ). If α ∈ N0 satisfies ℓ (α) = k for
1 < k ≤ N set α   e = θk (α − ε (k)) = (αk − 1, α1 , . . . , αk−1 , 0, . . .).
   In [2] the formula for Dk (κ) is stated for the p-basis {ζα (κ)}. To use the result
here it suffices to invoke the transformation formula ζα (κ) = h(α,κ+1)      x
                                                                     h(α,1) ζα (κ) for
α ∈ NN 0 . The ratio does not have to be computed explicitly since only the values
   h(α,t)
of h(e
     α,t) for t = 1, κ + 1 are needed.

                                                              h (α, t)
Lemma 7. Let α ∈ NN
                  0 and suppose ℓ (α) = k then                         = (k − r (α, k)) κ + t +

Proof. Heuristically the Ferrers diagram for α          e is produced from that of α by
deleting the node at (k, 1) and moving the remainder of row k to the top (row
zero); then every node still has the same hook-length and the required ratio is
h (a, t; k, 1). Explicitly, h (e
                               α, t; i, j) = h (α, t; i − 1, j) for 2 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ j ≤ αi−1
and h (e α, t; 1, j − 1) = h (α, t; k, j) for 2 ≤ j ≤ αk because
           L (α; k, j) = #l : l < k, j ≤ αl + 1 ≤ αk
                        = # {l : 1 < l, j − 1 ≤ αl−1 ≤ αk − 1} = L (e
                                                                    α; 1, j − 1) .
Also
        L (α; k, 1) = # {l : l < k, 1 ≤ αl + 1 ≤ αk } = # {l : l < k, 0 ≤ αl < αk }
                   = k − # {l : l ≤ k, αl ≥ αk } = k − r (α, k) ,
thus h (α, t; 1, k) = κ (k − r (α, k)) + t + αk − 1.                                             

statement.

The term xα appears in the sum if (i) α = β, (ii) (with coefficient κ) for some j,

   The Lemma will be used in analyzing the effect of Dℓ(α) (κ) on qα (κ), the poly-
nomial defined in Theorem 4. The aim will be to show it suffices to consider
Dℓ(α) (κ) ζαx (κ). We point out that for any given partition τ with τ2 ≥ n there may
be several reasons why there can be no singular polynomial of isotype τ , notably
there may be no eigenfunction of {Ui (κ0 ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } with the respective eigenval-
ues {ξi (λ; κ0 ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N }, where λ is as specified in Theorem 2. Our proof singles
out one aspect, a certain nonvanishing coefficient of Dℓ(λ) (κ0 ) gλ which applies to
all cases.

                               4. The two-part case
    In this section we consider the simplest case where τ = (τ1 , τ2 ), κ0 = − m
                                                                               n with
gcd (m, n) = 1 and τ2 = n. By Corollary 1 τ1 = dn − 1 for some d ≥ 2 (since
τ1 ≥ τ2 ). We will show that there is no singular polynomial for κ0 of isotype τ .
By Theorem 2, if P    there exist singular polynomials for κ0 of isotype τ then there
                                                  n
exists gλ = xλ + β⊳λ Aβ xβ with λ = ((md) ) , Di (κ0 ) gλ = 0 and Ui (κ0 ) gλ =
ξi (λ; κ0 ) gλ for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . In fact, gλ = lim ζλx (κ). This follows from Theorem 4
                                             κ→κ0
because there is no κ0 -critical pair (λ, β) with ℓ (β) ≤ N . (The background for this
is detailed in [2]; briefly coef (ζαx , β) is independent of the number M of variables
provided max (ℓ (α) , ℓ (β)) ≤ M (see equation 3.5); also if ℓ (α) ≤ N < ℓ (α) + |α|
then not every factor of h (α, κ + 1) need appear as a pole of ζαx .) We start by
computing h (λ, κ + 1) and showing there is a unique β so that (λ, β) is a κ0 -critical
pair for λ and ℓ (β) = N + 1.
   For the rectangular diagram λ = ((md)n ) it is clear that L (λ; i, j) = n−i for 1 ≤

     i=1j=1 (iκ + j). Since gcd (m, n) = 1 the multiplicity of (nκ + m) in h (λ, κ + 1)
is one, occurring
                  as h (λ, κ + 1; 1, md − m + 1) . The algorithm of [3] yields β =
 0n , mnd for a κ0 -critical pair (λ, β). Note ℓ (β) = n + nd = τ2 + (τ1 + 1) = N + 1.
Also recall the easily proved rule: for any critical pair (α, γ) it always holds that if
i > ℓ (α) and γi = 0 then γj = 0 for all j > i; since r (α, i) = i = r (γ, i).

then (λ, β) is the unique κ0 -critical pair for λ.

Proof. Suppose γ ∈ NM    0 for some M ≥ N , and γ satisfies the conditions λ D γ
and Ri : (r (γ, i) − i) m = (λi − γi ) n for 1 ≤ i ≤ M (as usual, define λi = 0 for
any i > ℓ (λ), the equation is a restatement of (r (γ, i) − i) κ0 + (λi − γi ) = 0). We
must show γ = λ or γ = β. Since gcd (m, n) = 1 there exists η ∈ NM            0 so that
γ = mη (componentwise; note r (γ, i) = r (η, i) for each i). By condition Rn+1 we
have (r (η, n + 1) − n − 1) = −nηn+1 so that ηn+1 = 1 − n1 (r (η, n + 1) − 1) ≤ 1
and thus ηn+1 = 1 or ηn+1 = 0.
   If ηn+1 = 1 then r (η, n + 1) = 1, which implies ηi = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and ηi ≤ 1
                             1        1
for i > n + 1. Since |η| = m   |γ| = m  |λ| = nd we see that η + = 1nd and in fact
ηi = 1 for n + 1 ≤ i ≤ n (d + 1), since ηj = 0 and ηj+1 = 1 is impossible for j > n.
Thus r (1, η) = nd + 1 and condition R1 becomes (nd + 1 − 1) m = (md − 0) n. So
γ = β; the other conditions Ri are verified similarly.
   If ηn+1 = 0 then r (η, n + 1) = n + 1 and ℓ (η) = ℓ (γ) = n. But the conditions
λi = λ1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n = ℓ (λ) , λ D γ and ℓ (γ) = ℓ (λ) together imply γ = λ.         

Corollary 4. The polynomial ζλx (κ) in N = nd + n − 1 variables has no pole at

                                                           κ→κ0

Proof. By Theorem 4 gλ = lim ζλx (κ), since there is no γ ∈ NN
                                                             0 so that (λ, γ) is
                                     κ→κ0
κ0 -critical. By [2, Theorem 4.8] ζλx (κ) in nd + n − 1 variables has no pole at κ0
(since N = nd + n − 1 < ℓ (β)).                                                  

                  (r (γ, i) − i + 1) m = −γi n, for i > n.

Thus γ1 ≡ m − 1 mod m and γi ≡ 0 mod m for i ≥ 2. Consider the condi-
tion Rn+1 : (r (η, n + 1) − n − 1) m = −nγn+1 , equivalent to γn+1 /m = 1 −
(r (γ, n + 1) − 1) /n ≤ 1. Thus γn+1 = m or γn+1 = 0. If γn+1 = m then
r (γ, n + 1) = 1, implying that γi < m for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The congruence condi-
tions imply γ1 = m − 1 and γi = 0 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Arguing similarly to Proposition
3 we see that γi = m or γi = 0 for i ≥ n + 1; the condition |γ| = nmd − 1 shows
that γ = m − 1, 0n−1 , mnd−1 . To verify R1 note r (γ, 1) = nd so (nd − n) m =

                                    5. The general case
    In this section we consider the singular value κ0 = − m    n with gcd (m, n) = 1 and
2 ≤ n ≤ N for the isotype τ , where τ has two or more parts and τ2 > n. Let
l = ℓ (τ ) ≥ 2. We assume there exists a singular polynomial for κ0 of isotype τ
and will eventually arrive at a contradiction. By Corollary 1 there are integers
d1 , d2 , . . . , dl−1 so that τi = di n − 1 for 1 ≤ i < l. Because τ is a partition it
follows that d1 ≥ d2 ≥ . . . ≥ dl−1 . By hypothesis τ1 ≥ τ2 > n so that d1 ≥ 2, and
d2 ≥ 2 if l ≥ 3. By Theorem   P     2 there is a corresponding partition λ and a singular
polynomial gλ = xλ + β⊳λ Aβ xβ with Ui (κ0 ) gλ = ξi (λ; κ0 ) gλ for 1 ≤ i ≤ N .
The computations are expressed in terms of (with 1 ≤ i ≤ l − 1):
                  l−i
                  X            l−i

Also let p0 = 0, pl = N . Note that pl−1 = ℓ (λ) = N − τ1 , tl−1 = d1 ≥ 2 and
|γ| + 1 = |α| = |λ| because (τ1 + 1) m =n nd1 m = nmtl−1 . By Theorem   o   4 there

                                      P             x
exists a polynomial qλ (κ) = ζλ (κ) +     Bβ (κ) ζβ (κ) : β ∈ C (λ, κ0 ) which has
no pole at κ0 and lim qλ (κ) = gλ ; the coefficients Bβ (κ) ∈ Q (κ, v) and C (λ, κ0 )
                     κ→κ0
is the set of β such that (λ, β) is a κ0 -critical pair.                           
   We will show lim Dℓ(λ) (κ) qλ (κ) 6= 0 by showing lim coef Dℓ(λ) (κ) qλ (κ) , γ 6=

0. The proof has two parts: firstly we show that coef Dℓ(λ) (κ) qλ (κ) , γ =
coef Dℓ(λ) (κ) ζλx (κ) , γ and secondly we use the Insertion Theorem 3 and the
result from the previous section.
                                                               

Proof. By construction coef Dℓ(λ) (κ) xδ , γ = coef xℓ(λ) Dℓ(λ) (κ) xδ , α . By Lemma
8 δ = α or δ + ≻ α+ or δ = (ℓ (λ) , j) α with αℓ(λ) > αj ; but in the latter case
j < ℓ (λ) (in fact ℓ (λ) − n ≤ j < ℓ (λ) and αj = 0) so that δ ≻ α. Thus δ D α. 
   To complete the first part of the argument we need only show that there is no
κ0 -critical pair (λ, β) with β D α.
Theorem 6. Suppose β ∈ NM     0 (with some M ≥ N ), λ D β D α and β satisfies the
rank equation (r (β, i) − i) m = (λi − βi ) n for i ≥ 1 then β = λ.
Proof. The rank equation and definition of α imply m|βi and m|αi for each i ;
since the definition of ⊲ implies that µ ⊲ ν if and only if mµ ⊲ mν for arbitrary
compositions µ, ν (where (mµ)i := mµi ) we will assume that m = 1 in the rest

at an index i with λi = tj , that is, pj−1 + 1 ≤ i ≤ pj , then r (β, i) = pk−1 + 1 and
the rank equation implies

The inequality τl+1−j − τl−k+1 ≤ 0 holds because τ is a partition and l − k + 1 ≤
l − j + 1 by hypothesis. The chain of inequalities shows that j = k and i = pk−1 + 1
(the possibility i > pk−1 + 1 has not yet been ruled out).
   The key to the argument is the value of βℓ(λ)+1 (recall ℓ (λ) = pl−1 ). The case
βpl−1 +1 = tj is impossible for 1 ≤ j ≤ l − 1; indeed suppose βpl−1 +1 = tj then
r (β, pl−1 + 1) ≥ pj−1 + 1 and the rank equation is pl−1 + 1 = r (β, pl−1 + 1) + ntj
(note λpl−1 +1 = 0) thus
                           0 ≤ (pl−1 + 1 − ntj ) − (pj−1 + 1)
                             = τl+1−j − τ1 − (l − j) ≤ j − l < 0.
which is a contradiction (the calculation is similar to the previous one, replacing k
byl and tk by tl = 	0). The condition β +  λ now implies that βpl−1 +1 < tl−1 and
# j : βj > βpl−1 +1 ≥ ℓ (λ)−n = pl−1 −n, hence r (β, pl−1 + 1) ≥ pl−1 −n+1. The
rank equation is −nβpl−1 +1 = r (β, pl−1 + 1) − (pl−1 + 1) ≥ −n and so βpl−1 +1 ≤ 1.
     Suppose βpl−1 +1 = 0 then r (β, pl−1 + 1) = (pl−1 + 1) which implies βi = 0 for
i > pl−1 + 1 and βi > 0 for i ≤ pl−1 . Since β + differs from λ in at most the
                                                                                        +
last n entries
                        and λi = tl−1 for ℓ (λ) − n < i ≤ ℓ (λ) it follows that β      = λ (note
        n                                                                           n
if tl−1  µ where µ is a partition and ℓ (µ) = n then µ = tl−1 ). Since the
entries of β can not move to the left, β = λ; in detail, argue inductively that the
only possible value for βi when 1 ≤ i ≤ p1 is t1 , then the only possible value when
p1 + 1 ≤ i ≤ p2 is t2 , and so on. (If l = 2 then this argument is not needed.)
     Suppose βpl−1 +1 = 1. In this part replace the bound β D α by β D α′ :=

            1
              
is a − n -critical pair). We will show that β = α′ , which contradicts the assumption
ℓ (β) = N . Recall tj > tl−1 ≥ 2 for 1 ≤ j < l − 1, by the hypothesis τ1 ≥ τ2 > n.
The rank equation yields r (β, pl−1 + 1) = (pl−1 + 1) − nβpl−1 +1 = pl−1 + 1 − n. For
i < pl−1 + 1 this implies βi = tj for some j or βi < 1, that is, βi = 0; for i > pl−1 + 1
the rank implies βi = tj for some j or βi ≤ 1. This forces the values of β other than

|λ| = |β| shows that # {j : βj = 1} = ntl−1 = τ1 + 1. Since βi = 1 is ruled out for

i ≤ pl−1 it follows that βi = 1 for pl−1 +1 ≤ i ≤ pl−1 +τ1 +1 = N +1; indeed suppose
the j th occurrence of 1 in β is at index i, that is, r (β, i) = pl−1 + j − n, βi = 1 and
i > pl−1 then the rank equation implies r (β, i)−i = (pl−1 + j − n)−i = −nβi = −n
thus i = pl−1 +j, for 1 ≤ j ≤ τ1 +1. The n remaining values of βi (for 1 ≤ i ≤ N +1)
                             +
are zero, and so β + = (α′ ) . The condition β D α′ implies β  α′ (by definition)

then βi = tj and if pl−2 + 1 ≤ i ≤ pl−1 − n then βi = tl−1 ). Thus βi = 0 for
pl−1 − n < i ≤ pl−1 and β = α′ . The proof is finished since ℓ (α′ ) = N + 1.           

of singular polynomials for the group SN . For each pair (m0 , n0 ) ∈ N2 with 2 ≤

               0
                  / N, let d = gcd (m0 , n0 ) , m = md0 , n = nd0 , then there is a unique
irreducible SN -module of singular polynomials for the singular value κ0 = − m        n of
isotype τ , where
                                                

For l ≥ 3 the computation for λ uses the notation of the previous section with
ti = d + l − 1 − i, mti = m0 + (l − 1 − i) m for 1 ≤ i ≤ l − 1. The SN -module of
singular polynomials is spanQ {wζλx (κ0 ) : w ∈ SN } and the basis corresponding to
Murphy’s construction is exactly the set of ζαx (κ0 ) such that α is a reverse lattice
permutation of λ. There are no other singular polynomials.

   The relation of modules of singular polynomials to monodromy representations
of the Hecke algebra was discussed in [4, Sect.6]. The parameter is q = e−2πiκ ; the
existence of singular polynomials of isotype τ shows that the monodromy repre-
sentation corresponding to τ contains the trivial representation. There is a general
result on the connection between monodromy (called the KZ-functor) and the dual
Specht modules in [7, Sect. 6.2].
   Recall the definition of the rational Cherednik algebra (see [7, Sect. 3] and [6]).
We consider the image A (κ) under the faithful representation on P; indeed A (κ) is
the Q (κ)-algebra generated by {Di (κ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } ∪ {xi : 1 ≤ i ≤ N } ∪ SN (where
xi denotes the multiplication map p (x) 7→ xi p (x) and w ∈ SN acts by p (x) 7→
p (xw) for p ∈ P). In the sequel, when κ is specialized to a rational κ0 ,we use P 	to
denote the polynomials with rational coefficients (that is, spanQ xα : α ∈ NN     0 ).
Here are some basic results about A (κ)-submodules of P.
Proposition 5. Suppose M is a nontrivial proper A (κ0 )-submodule of P for some
κ0 ∈ Q, then M is the direct sum of its homogeneous components Mn := M ∩ Pn
for n ∈ N0 , the nonzero component Mn0 of least degree (Mj = {0} for j < n0 ) is
an SN -module of singular polynomials and κ0 is a singular value.
                    PN              PN       ∂      P
Proof. The identity i=1 xi Di (κ) = i=1 xi ∂x    + κ 1≤i<j≤N (1 − (i, j)) implies
                         PN     ∂
                                               i
                                                          P∞
that the Euler operator i=1 xi ∂x i
                                    ∈ A (κ). Hence M = n=0 (M ∩ Pn ). There
exists n0 > 0 such that Mn0 6= {0} and Mj = {0} for 0 ≤ j < n0 (or else
M0 6= {0} , 1 ∈ M and so M = P. Then Di (κ0 ) p = 0 for any p ∈ Mn0 and
1 ≤ i ≤ N.                                                                     
   Say that the degree of an A (κ0 )-submodule M is the least degree of nonzero
homogeneous components of M , that is, min {j : Mj 6= {0}}. There is a symmetric
bilinear form on P defined by
                       hp, qiκ = p (D1 (κ) , . . . , DN (κ)) q (x) |x=0 .
The radical was defined in [4, Sect. 4] to be
                     Rad (κ) := {p ∈ P : hp, qiκ = 0 for all q ∈ P}
and was shown to be an A (κ)-submodule. For κ0 ∈ Q, Rad (κ0 ) 6= {0} exactly
when κ0 is a singular value.
Proposition 6. For any singular value κ0 the radical Rad (κ0 ) is the largest proper
A (κ0 )-submodule of P.
Proof. Suppose M is a nontrivial proper A (κ0 )-submodule. Suppose p ∈ Mn                   =
M ∩ Pn for some n > 0 and p 6= 0. Then for any q ∈ Pn we have hp, qiκ0                      =
hq, piκ0 = q (D1 (κ) , . . . , DN (κ)) p (x) ∈ M0 = {0}. Hence p ∈ Rad (κ0 ) and M          ⊂
Rad (κ0 ).                                                                                  
   Our complete description of irreducible SN -modules of singular polynomials leads
to some explicit results about A (κ0 )-submodules. We use the notation from equa-
tions 6.1 and 6.2.

   The following is from [2, Sect. 6]:
Proposition 7. M (m0 , n0 ) is a proper A (κ0 )-submodule,
                                                            and its degree is
m 12 (l − 2) (n − 1) (2d + l − 3) + τl (d + l − 2) (where d = gcd (m0 , n0 ) n = n0 /d
and m = m0 /d).
Proof. Clearly M (m0 , n0 ) is closed under multiplication
                                                  x           by P and the 	 action of
SN . Suppose f = pg where p ∈ P and g ∈ span ζw      iλ
                                                        (κ 0 ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n τ (that is, g
is singular). By the product rule,
                                               X
                                       ∂                       p (x) − p (x (i, j))
       Di (κ0 ) f = pDi (κ0 ) g + g       p + κ0   ((i, j) g)
                                      ∂xi                            xi − xj
                                                    j6=i

for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . But Di (κ0 ) g = 0 and p(x)−p(x(i,j))
                                           xi −xj     is a polynomial, thus Di (κ0 ) f ∈
M (m0 , n0 ). The degree is |λ| (as in equation 6.2).                                  

   An equivalent formula for |λ|                                      1
                                    m is (N − nd + 1) (d + l − 2)− 2 (n − 1) (l − 1) (l − 2).
For a given pair
              (m, n) with gcd (m, n)	        = 1 (and 2 ≤ n ≤ N ) there are the A (κ0 )-
submodules M (dm, dn) : 1 ≤ d ≤ N           n      (⌊r⌋ denotes the largest integer ≤ r). The
degree of M (dm, dn) decreases as d increases. This is obvious because the nonzero
part of the index λ for M ((d + 1) m, (d + 1) n) is a substring of the index λ′ for
M (dm, dn); for example take N = 10, κ0 =− 31 then the values of λ (from equa-
tion 6.2) are 42 , 32 , 22 , 12 , 02 , 4, 32 , 22 , 05 , 32 , 08 for d = 1, 2, 3 respectively.
For direct computation, let l, τ, λ and l′ , τ ′ , λ′ denote the expressions defined in
equations 6.1 and 6.2 for (m0 , n0 ) equal to (dm, dn) and ((d + 1) m, (d + 1) n) re-
spectively. If τl = 1 then l′ = l − 2 and τl−2        ′
                                                           = n − 1; if 2 ≤ τl ≤ n − 1 then
l = l − 1 and τl−1 = τl − 1. For both cases |λ| − |λ′ | = m (dn + l − 2). Thus
 ′                ′

for any given degree of homogeneity there is at most one irreducible SN -module of
singular polynomials of that degree (for κ0 = − m             ). The singular polynomials of

  As well as the maximum A (κ0 )-submodule there is a minimum one, namely,
M (m, n).
Proposition 9. Suppose gcd (m, n) = 1 and 2 ≤ n ≤ N then M (m, n) is contained
in each nontrivial A − m  n -submodule.

Proof. Let M be a proper nontrivial A − m     n -submodule. Let s0 be the degree of
M . By Proposition 5 Ms0 is an SN -module of singular polynomials, thus s0 = |λ|

   One could speculate
                       that M (dm, dn) : 1 ≤ d ≤ N n    is the collection of all non-
trivial proper A − m
                   n   -submodules and that they are nested,  that is, M (dm, dn) ⊂
M ((d + 1) m, (d + 1) n). This would be a characterization of Rad − m  n .
