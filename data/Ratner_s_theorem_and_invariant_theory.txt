      Abstract. In this note, we consider applications of Ratner's theorem to construc-
      tions of families of polynomials with dense values on the set of primitive integer
      points from the viewpoint of invariant theory.



   Let Q be a non-degenerate indenite quadratic form in n  3 variables. We say
Q is irrational if the ratio of at least one pair of coecients is irrational.
   The following theorem was called the Oppenheim conjecture and was proved in
nal form by Margulis [9].
Theorem 1 (Margulis) If Q(x) is an irrational non-degenerate indenite qua-
dratic form in n  3 variables, the set fQ(x) j x 2 Zng is dense in R .
   Many partial results were known prior to the work of Margulis (for example,
Oppenheim [10], [11], [12], Davenport (with others) [6], [4] [5], [1], [19]). Note that
because of a result of Lewis [7], these results imply the Oppenheim conjecture for
such Q with n  21. For forms of higher degree, there is a result by Schmidt [22].
   Raghunathan reduced the Oppenheim conjecture to the following problem.
Problem 2 Show that SO(Q)RSL(3)Z is dense in SL(3)R.
   What Margulis did was to solve the above problem, and in fact he proved that
the values of Q on the set of primitive integer points are dense in R .
   This problem can be viewed as a problem on orbit closures in Lie groups. We
rst recall Ratner's theorem.
Theorem 3 (Ratner) Let G be a connected Lie group and U a connected subgroup
of G generated by unipotent elements of G. Then given any lattice  G and
x 2 G, there exists a connected closed subgroup U  F  G such that Ux = Fx .
Moreover, F=(F \ (x x 1 )) has a nite invariant measure.
   The rst statement was called Raghunathan's topological conjecture, and the
second statement was proved by Ratner in conjunction with Raghunathan's topo-
logical conjecture. Raghunathan's topological conjecture was published by Dani [3]
for one dimensional unipotent groups and was generalized to groups generated by
unipotent elements by Margulis [8]. The proof for the general case was given by
   1991 Mathematics Subject Classication. Primary 11J25; Secondary 22E40.

Ratner in a series of papers [14], [15], [16], [17]. For these, there is an excellent
survey article by Ratner [18].
   Note that F in the above theorem is unique. To see this, one should note that
the image of F in G= by the map g ! gx is F=(F \ (x x 1 )) and F \ (x x 1 )
is a discrete subgroup of F . So the tangent space of F at the unit element is
determined by the image of F in G= . Also if 1 ; 2 are commensurable lattices
and Ux i = Fi x for i = 1; 2, F1 = F2 . To see this, one can assume that 1  2
and the index of 1 in 2 is nite. Then if g1;    ; gl are representatives of 1 n 2 ,
                   Ux 2 = [li=1 Ux 1gi = [li=1 F1 x 1 gi = F1x 2 :
Because of the uniqueness of F , F2 = F1 .
    It is easy to deduce Problem 2 (and hence Theorem 1) from Ratner's theorem.
We will not give the proof here, but we will use a similar argument later in Theorems
7,14 to construct a family of quartic forms in four variables whose values on the set
of primitive integer points are dense in R .
    For any algebraic group G dened over a subeld of R , let GR+ be the identity
component of GR in the classical topology. We denote the identity component of G
in the Zariski topology by G . Therefore, GR is the set of R -rational points in G ,
and this group may not be connected in the classical topology. If G is an algebraic
group over C , it is connected in the Zariski topology if and only if GC is connected
in the classical topology. So the identity component of GC in the classical topology
is an algebraic group over C . We use the notation GC for this identity component
and this can be regarded as the set of C -valued points in the identity component
G in the Zariski topology. If F is an algebraic group over C and k is a subeld of
C , we say F is dened over k if there exists an algebraic group G over k such that
F = GC . Suppose G is an algebraic group dened over a subeld k of C . Then it
is known that the identity component GC is dened over k (see [2, p. 47]).
    If a connected Lie group F is in the form F = GR+ for an algebraic group G
over Q , we say that F is dened over Q . Moreover, we use the notation FC for GC
even though this is a slight abuse of notation. By the above remark, GC is dened
over Q . So we may choose such G so that GC is connected. This G is automatically
connected in the Zariski topology over any extension of Q .
    Now let H1  H2 be algebraic groups over Q (and so H1 is a closed sub-
group). We assume that H2 is semi-simple, and H1C ; H2C are connected. Consider
H1R+; H2R+. For any closed connected Lie subgroup H  H2R+, we consider the
following condition.
Condition 4 H is generated by unipotent elements. Moreover, the projection of
H to any simple component of H2R+ is non-trivial.
    Note that if a connected Lie group H is simple and non-compact, H is generated
by unipotent elements. We assume that H1R+ satises Condition 4. Suppose we
can carry out the following problem.
Problem 5 (a) Classify all the closed connected complex Lie subgroups F such that
H1C  F  H2C and show that there are only nitely many such F 's. Moreover,
show that all such F 's are dened over Q .

(b) For each F 6= H2C , construct an H2 -variety XF dened over Q with the property
that F has a unique xed point wF 2 XF Q in XF C .
   Of course, we may not always be able to carry out Problem 5. Note that the
existence of XF in (2) in many cases follows from a theorem of Borel and Harish{
Chandra. More precisely, suppose F in Problem 5 satises the following condition
              fh 2 H2C j hfh 1 2 NH2C (F ) for all f 2 F g = NH2C (F )
(NH2C (F ) is the normalizer of F in H2C ). Then there exists a faithful representation
H2 ! GL(E ) of H2 dened over Q and a point v 2 P(E )Q such that NH2C (F ) is
the stabilizer of v in H2C (see 5.1 Theorem [2, p. 89]). Let X be the image of
H2 in P(E ) by the map H2 3 h ! hv 2 P(E ). Then X is a locally closed subset
of P(E ) dened over Q (since X is a homogeneous space). Then y = hv 2 XC
(h 2 H2C ) is a xed point of F if and only if hfh 1 2 NH2C (F ) for all f 2 F , and
so h 2 NH2C (F ). So we may choose this X as XF . We will consider Problem 5 for
certain situations (see Problem 9), and so far the above condition is satised for all
the cases we considered.
    In the following, we assume that we carried out Problem 5.
Denition 6 An element g 2 H2C is suciently irrational if gwF 2= XF Q for all
F 6= H2C .
    Note that if F1 ; F2 are such groups and there exists an H2-equivariant map
XF1 ! XF2 dened over Q , we don't have to consider XF1 , because XF1Q maps to
XF2Q . Let  H2R+ be an arithmetic lattice. Now the following theorem is an
easy consequence of Ratner's theorem.
Theorem 7 Suppose g 2 H2C is suciently irrational, gH1C g 1 is dened over R ,
and the identity component U of (gH1C g 1) \ H2R satises Condition 4. Then U
is dense in H2R+.
Proof. By Ratner's theorem, there exists a closed connected subgroup U  F1 
H2R+ such that U = F1 . Moreover, F1 is dened over Q by Proposition (3.2)
[23, pp. 321{322]. Note that Shah considered a particular lattice in [23], but by
our commensurability discussion of lattices after Ratner's theorem, we can consider
any arithmetic lattice.
    Suppose F1 6= H2R+. Then dim F1 < dim H2R+. Since both groups are dened
over Q , F1C 6= H2C by considering the Lie algebras. Since gH1C g 1 is dened over
R , gH1C g 1  F1C . So H1C  g 1 F1C g 6= H2C . Since we are assuming we carried
out Problem 5, there exists an algebraic group F2 over Q such that g 1F1C g = F2C .
Since wF2 is the unique xed point by g 1F1C g, pF1 = gwF2 is the unique xed
point by F1C . Let  2 Aut(C =Q ). Then F1C = F1C clearly xes pF1 . By the
uniqueness of the xed point, pF1 = pF1 . Since this is true for all  2 Aut(C =Q ),
pF1 = gwF2 2 XF2Q , which is a contradiction since we assumed that g is suciently
irrational. 
   We want to use the above observation in the setting of prehomogeneous vector
spaces. We now recall the denition of prehomogeneous vector spaces. Let G be a
reductive group, V a representation of G, and  a non-trivial character, all dened
4                                 AKIHIKO YUKIE

over a eld k of characteristic zero. We assume that Gk is connected in the Zariski
topology.
Denition 8 (G; V; ) is called a prehomogeneous vector space if
(1) there exists a Zariski open orbit,
(2) there exists a non-zero polynomial (x) 2 k[V ] such that (gx) = (g)(x)
for all g 2 G; x 2 V .
   Let V ss = fx 2 V j (x) 6= 0g and we call it the set of semi-stable points. A
polynomial (x) in (2) is called a relative invariant polynomial. If the represen-
tation is irreducible, the choice of  is essentially unique and we may write (G; V )
also.
   For the rest of this paper, we only consider irreducible prehomogeneous vector
spaces. Let (G; V ) be a prehomogeneous vector space. If there exists a relative
invariant polynomial (x) whose Hessian is not identically zero, (G; V ) is called
regular. It is known (see [21]) that the regularity is equivalent to the existence of a
point w in the open orbit in Vkss whose stabilizer Gw is reductive (since ch k = 0).
An important consequence of the regularity is that Vkss is a single Gk -orbit. Up to
a certain notion of equivalence, irreducible regular prehomogeneous vector spaces
over any algebraically closed eld k of characteristic zero were classied by M. Sato
and Kimura in [21]. Each equivalence class contains a prehomogeneous vector space
(G; V ) such that dim V is the smallest, and such (G; V ) is called reduced. Over
local and global elds, the classication was carried out by H. Saito [20]. We list the
split forms of irreducible reduced regular prehomogeneous vector spaces as follows.
(1) G = GL(n)  G0 ; V = M(n; n) where G0  GL(n) is a reductive subgroup such
that kn is an irreducible representation of G0 .
(2) G = GL(1)  GL(n); V = Sym2 kn .
(3) G = GL(2n); V = ^2 kn .
(4) G = GL(1)  GL(2); V = Sym2 k3.
(5), (6), (7) G = GL(1)  GL(n); V = ^3 kn where n = 6; 7; 8 (as in E6; E7; E8).
(8) G = GL(3)  GL(2); V = Sym3 
 k2 .
(9) G = GL(6)  GL(2); V = ^2 k6 
 k2.
(10), (11) G = GL(n)  GL(5); V = kn 
 ^2 k5 where n = 3; 4.
(12) G = GL(3)  GL(3)  GL(2); V = M(3; 3) 
 k2.
(13) G = GSp(2n)  GL(2m); V = k2n 
 k2m where n  2m  2.
(14) G = GSp(6) and V = k14 is the irreducible representation which corresponds
to the third fundamental weight.
(15) G = GO(n)  GL(m); V = kn 
 km.
(16), (17), (18) G = GSpin(7)  GL(n); V = k8 
 kn where k8 is the spin repre-
sentation and n = 1; 2; 3.
(19), (22) G = GSpin(n) where n = 9; 11 and V is the spin representation.
(20), (21) G = GSpin(10)  GL(n); V = k16 
 kn where k16 is the half spin
representation and n = 2; 3.
(23), (24) G = GSpin(n) where n = 12; 14 and V is the half spin representation.
(25), (26) G = G2  GL(n); V = k7 
 kn where G2 is the automorphism group of
the split octonion, k7 is the imaginary part of the split octonion, and n = 1; 2.

(27), (28) G = E6  GL(n); V = J 
 kn where E6 is a semi-simple group of type
E6 and J is the exceptional Jordan algebra.
(29) G is a group whose semi-simple part is a group of type E7 and V = k  k  J  J .
    In the above list, GSp(2n); GO(n); GSpin(n) are the groups dened similarly as
Sp(2n); O(n); Spin(n) except for allowing scalar multiplications.
    Now let (G; V ) be an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space in (1){(29). Let
w 2 VZss, and H = [G; G]. Then H is a semi-simple group. Let Hw be the stabilizer
of w in H . We consider the following two problems.
Problem 9 (1) Carry out Problem 5 for H1 = Hw ; H2 = H .
(2) Carry out Problem 5 for the image H1 of H in SL(V ) and H2 = SL(V ).
    For Problem 9(2), we do not necessarily have to consider prehomogeneous vector
spaces. Let V be a rational representation of a semi-simple algebraic group H over
Q such that HC is connected. Then we can consider Problem 9(2) for H1 ; H2 dened
in the same manner.
    Consider problem 9(1) for the case (1) in the classication. Let H 0 = [G0 ; G0].
Then H = SL(n)  H 0 in this case, and w = In (the identity matrix) belongs to
VZss. It is easy to see that Hw = f(h; t h 1 ) j h 2 H 0 g. So Problem 9(1) for this case
is almost equivalent to Problem 9(2) for irreducible representations of semi-simple
groups. Since this case contains a rather large class of representations, we do not
consider the case (1) in the classication when we consider Problem 9(1), and treat
it separately as Problem 9(2).
    Consider Problem 9(1). If x 2 VRss , there exists g 2 GC such that gw = x. We
can choose t in the center of GC and h 2 HC so that g = th.
Denition 10 A point x 2 VRss is suciently irrational if there exists an element
g = th 2 GC as above such that h is suciently irrational.
    Problem 9(1) is not applicable to cases (2) n = 2, (4), (8), (9), (11), (12), (15)
m = 2, (17), (26), (28) because stabilizers of points in V ss do not satisfy Condition
4. In [26], [25], [27], we considered cases (3), (5), (6), (7), (10). In [28], we consider
all the other applicable cases except for the cases (1), (29). For the case (29), we
seem to need a new interpretation of the \Freudenthal quartic". For Problem 9(1),
we also construct G-equivariant maps F : V ss ! XF for all F 's in Problem 5 so
that F (w) = wF . Moreover, the center of G acts trivially on XF for all F . So
an alternative way of stating the above denition is that x 2 VRss is suciently
irrational if F (x) 2= XF Q for all F , because F (x) = tF (w) = twF .
    If x 2 VRss, there exists g 2 GC such that x = gw. We write g = th as above.
Then HxC is dened over R . Since HxC = hHw C h 1 , this group is also dened over
R . Note that we cannot assume g 2 GR in Denition 10 since VRss is not necessarily
a single GR-orbit.
    We state an application of Problem 9(1). Consider the case (5) in the classica-
tion. Let e1 ;    ; e6 be the standard basis of k6 , and w = e1 ^ e2 ^ e3 + e4 ^ e5 ^ e6 .
Let E1 ; E2 be subspaces of k6 spanned by fe1 ; e2; e3g; fe4; e5 ; e6g respectively. It
is known that w 2 VRss . Let Gr(3; 6) be the Grassmann of 3-spaces in k6, and
X = (Z=2Z) n (Gr(3; 6)  Gr(3; 6)) where Z=2Z acts by exchanging two factors.
Let [EP1]; [E2] 2 Gr(3; 6); ([E1]; [E2]) 2 X be the points determined by E1 ; E2. Let
x = xijk ei ^ ej ^ ek = gw 2 VRss where g 2 GL(6)C . Then it turns out that
6                                 AKIHIKO YUKIE

x is suciently irrational if g[E1]; g[E2] 2= Gr(3; 6)Q and g([E1]; [E2]) 2= XQ . Both
Gr(3; 6) and X are dened over Q and one can determine whether or not a point
in these spaces is rational by considering Plucker coordinates. In this case, HxR+
satises Condition 4 for all x 2 VRss [25]. The following result is proved in [25].
Theorem 11 Suppose x 2 VRss is suciently irrational. Then for any y = (yijk ) 2
^3 R 5 and  > 0, there exists a Z{basis fu1 ;    ; u6g of (Z6) (the dual) such that
                               jyijk x(ui ; uj ; uk )j < 
for all i < j < k  5.
    We proved similar statements for cases (3), (6) in [25] (the irrationality condition
is slightly easier).
    We list XF 's for Problem 9(1) except for the cases (1), (29).

    We probably need some explanation. For (5), we can associate two 3-dimensional
subspaces of a 6-dimensional space (which is the standard representation of GL(6))
to any point in V ss. For this, the reader should see [25]. For (10), we can associate
quadratic forms on two vector spaces V1 ; V2 of dimensions three and ve (the preho-
mogeneous vector space (5) is considered as ^2 V2 
V1 ) to any point in V ss. For (18),
we can associate a 3-dimensional subspace of a 7-dimensional space (which is the
vector representation of GSpin(7)) to any point in V ss . For (19), P8 is the projec-
tive space associated with the vector representation of GSpin(9). For (21), we can
associate a 4-dimensional subspace, a 5-dimensional subspace of a 10-dimensional
space (which is the vector representation of GSpin(10)), and a quadratic form in
                  RATNER'S THEOREM AND INVARIANT THEORY                                   7

three variables to any point in V ss. By considering combinations of these subspaces,
we get varieties as above. For (20), (22), (24), the numbers 10, 12, 14 are the di-
mensions of the vector representations. For (13) (2m = n), (15) (2m = n), (20),
(24), we do not have to consider Gr(2m; 4m); Gr(m; 2m); Gr(5; 10); Gr(7; 14) as we
do for (5), (14), (22).
   Consider Problem 9(2). Let (G; V ) be a prehomogeneous vector space in (1){
(29), and (x) the relative invariant polynomial of the minimum degree. Suppose
we carry out Problem 9(2). Then we conjecture the following application.
Conjecture 12 If g 2 GL(V )R is suciently irrational, the values of (g 1x) on
the set of primitive integer points x are dense in R.
   Note that if f (x) is a polynomial on V , the natural action of g on f is given by
f (g 1x). Let d be the degree of (x). Then since (G; V ) is a prehomogeneous vector
space, (x) is the unique HC invariant of degree d up to a constant. Therefore,
we may choose XF = P(Symd V ) and wF = [] 2 P(Symd V  ) (the class of ) for
F = H1C for Problem 9(2).
   We will carry out Problem 9(2) and Conjecture 12 for the case (4) in the clas-
sication here. In this case, H = SL(2) and H2 = SL(4). If g is in the kernel of
the homomorphism H ! H2 , g is a scalar matrix tI2 and t3 = 1. Since this is an
element of SL(2), t2 = 1 and this implies t = 1. So we may regard H as a subgroup
of H2 . Therefore, H1 = H = SL(2) in this case.
   We regard V as the space of cubic forms in two variables v = (v1 ; v2). For
x = x0v13 + x1v22 v2 + x2v1 v22 + x3v23 , y = y0v13 + y1v22 v2 + y2v1 v22 + y3v23 , we dene
                       B (x; y) = x0 y3 13 x1y2 + 13 x2 y1 x3 y0:
Then it is well known that the alternating bilinear form B is invariant under the
action of H1. For example, this B is used in [24, p. 154]. We denote the symplectic
group with respect to B by Sp(4).
Lemma 13 If H1C  F  H2C is a closed connected complex Lie subgroup, F =
SL(2)C ; Sp(4)C , or SL(4)C .
Proof. Let h1 ; f; h2 be the Lie algebras of H1C ; F; H2C . These are vector spaces over
C . Let  be the fundamental dominant weight of the Lie algebra h1 . We use the
notation d for the irreducible representation of h1 with highest weight d.
   By considering weights, h2 = h1  4  6 and h1         = 2. Let U1 = 4; U2 = 6.
Let h3 = sp(4)C be the Lie algebra of Sp(4)C . Counting the dimension, h3 = h1 U2 .
Since h3 is a Lie subalgebra of h2, h2 is a representation of h3 . Since h3 is semi-
simple, there exists a representation U3 of h3 such that h2 = h3  U3. Now U3 can
be regarded as a representation of h1. Since h3 is isomorphic to 2  6, U3 must
be the factor 4. So U1 = 4 is a representation of h3 . This implies that [U1 ; U1]
is a representation of h3 also. Since h2 is a simple group, [U1; U1] \ h3 6= 0. Since
h3 is the adjoint representation of a simple group, it is irreducible, and therefore,
[U1; U1]  h3 . So we can conclude that if f  U1, f = h2 . This proves the lemma. 
   The groups SL(2); SL(4); Sp(4) are all dened over Q . It is known [24, p. 150]
that the relative invariant polynomial of the lowest degree is
                (x) = x21x22 + 18x0x1 x2x3 4x0x32 4x31 x3 27x20 x23

for x = x0 v13 + x1 v12 v2 + x2v1 v22 + x3 v23. Therefore, for F = SL(2)C , we may choose
XF = P(Sym4 V  ) and wF = [] (the class of ). It is well known that the
alternating bilinear form xed by a simplectic group is a constant multiple of the
corresponding alternating bilinear form. Therefore, for F = Sp(4)C , we may choose
XF = P(^2 V ) and wF = [B ] (the class of B ). This is the answer to Problem 9(2)
in this case.
Theorem 14 Suppose g 2 GL(4)R, g[] 2= P(Sym4 V  )Q , and g[B ] 2= P(^2 V  )Q .
Then the values of (g 1x) on the set of primitive integer points x are dense in R .
Proof. If det g < 0, we choose g0 2 GL(4)Z such that det g0 = 1. Then g[] 2=
P(Sym4 V  )Q ; g [B ] 2  = P(^2 V )Q if and only if g0g[] 2= P(Sym4 V  )Q ; g0g[B ] 2=
P(^2 V  )Q and the values of (g 1 x) on the set of primitive integer points x are
dense in R if and only if the values of (g 1g0 1 x) on the set of primitive integer
points x are dense in R . Therefore, we may assume that det g > 0. Then we
can write g = tI4g00 where t 2 R  and g00 2 SL(4)R. Since g[] = g00 [] and
g[B ] = g00 [B ], we may assume g 2 SL(4)R. Note that the center of SL(4) acts on
P(Sym4 V  ); P(^2 V  ) trivially.
   Let = SL(4)Z. Clearly, H1R; H2R are connected in the classical topology. So,
by Theorem 7, (gH1Rg 1 ) is dense in H2R. This implies that (gH1Rg 1) is dense
in H2R also. Let r 2 R  . Let diag(t1; t2; t3; t4) be the diagonal matrix with diagonal
entries t1 ; t2; t3; t4. Then h = diag( r4 ; 4r ; 1; 1) 2 SL(4)R and
                                   (h 1 (1; 0; 1; 0)) = r:
    There exist h1 2 gH1Rg     1   and h2 2 such that h2 h1 is close to hg 1. Then
           (h2 h1 g)(1; 0; 1; 0) = (h2 g)(1; 0; 1; 0) = (g 1h2 1 (1; 0; 1; 0))
is close to h(1; 0; 1; 0) = (h 1 (1; 0; 1; 0)) = r. Since h2 1 (1; 0; 1; 0) is a primitive
integer point, this proves the theorem. 
   Theorem 14 gives us a 13-dimensional family of quartic forms in four variables.
   Question 2 can be considered as Problem 9(1) for the prehomogeneous vector
space (2) n = 3 or Problem 9(2) for the prehomogeneous vector space (2) n = 2.
All the analytical diculties are contained in Ratner's theorem and Problem 5 for
this case is almost trivial (which of course does not mean that Question 2 is trivial).
   As far as Problem 9(2) is concerned, besides the prehomogeneous vector space
(4), we carried out this program for the representation (SL(2); Sym4 k2) [27], and
the adjoint representation of SL(3) [26].
   Let V be the representation space for both cases. For these cases, dim V = 5 or
8. It is well known that there are a quadratic invariant Q(x) and a cubic invariant
F (x) for both cases. Then we have the following theorem [26], [27].
Theorem 15 For the above two cases, if g 2 GL(V )R and Q(g 1x) is irrational,
the values of F (g 1x) at primitive integer points are dense in R .
   These are a 22-dimensional and a 56-dimensional family of cubic forms in 5 and
8 variables respectively. For cubic forms, Pitman [13] proved a weaker form of
                    RATNER'S THEOREM AND INVARIANT THEORY                                        9

the Oppenheim conjecture (in the sense that if f (x) is the form and  > 0, there
exists an integer point x 6= 0 such that jf (x)j < ). Still this weaker form requires
(1314)256 variables, and it is of interest to construct examples of forms with dense
values at primitive integer points.
   Consider Conjecture 12 for the prehomogeneous vector spaces (1){(29). If the
degree of  is two, the conjecture is not so interesting because it is contained in the
Oppenheim conjecture. This applies to cases (16), (19), (25). If a prehomogeneous
vector space (G1; V1) is contained in another prehomogeneous vector space (G2 ; V2)
and the restriction of a relative invariant polynomial on V2 is a relative invariant
polynomial on V1, Conjecture 12 for (G2; V2 ) is not so interesting. This applies to
cases (1), (5), (12), (17), (22), (23), (26), (27), (28), (29), because the cases (1),
(27) reduce to the case (2), the cases (5), (22), (23), (29) reduce to the case (14),
the cases (12), (28) reduce to the case (8), and the cases (17), (26) reduce to the
case (15) m = 2. It is not entirely clear, but probably the case (3) reduces to the
case (2), the case (9) reduces to the case (8), and the case (13) reduces to the case
(15). This leaves us the following cases.

    case (2) (4) (6) (7) (8) (10) (11) (14) (15) (20) (21) (24)
   deg  n 4 7 16 12 15 40 4 2m 4                      4    8
   Of course it is more interesting if deg  is relatively large compared to the number
of variables. In particular, by considering the cases (8), (11), it may be possible
to produce families of polynomials of degree 12 and 40 in 12 and 40 variables
respectively with dense values on the set of primitive integer points.
   Finally it is curious to see if one can construct families of polynomials with non-
trivial moduli (in other words, they consist of innitely many orbits) with dense
values on the set of primitive integer points. For example, it is possible to do so
using the representation (SL(2); Sym4 Q 2 ), but we have yet to know if this is possible
for the spaces of binary forms of higher degrees for example.
