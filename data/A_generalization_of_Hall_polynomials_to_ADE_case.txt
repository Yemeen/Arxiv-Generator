                                                      Abstract. Certain computable polynomials are described whose leading co-
                                                      efficients are equal to multiplicities in the tensor product decomposition for
                                                      representations of a Lie algebra of ADE type.




                                             1. Hall theorem. Given a prime number p and a positive integer l let Fp be a
                                             field with p elements, Fp be an algebraic closure of Fp , and Fpl be the subfield of
                                                                                            l
                                             Fp consisting of all x ∈ Fp such that xp = x. Thus Fpl is a field with pl elements.
                                                 Let k be a field, and let k[[t]] be the ring of formal power series with co-
                                             efficients in k considered as a k-algebra. To a representation π of k[[t]] in a
                                             finite dimensional k-linear space       D one can associate a partition λ as follows:
                                             λi = dimk im π(ti−1 )/ im π(ti ) . This partition is called the type of the repre-
                                             sentation π (in [Mac95] the conjugate partition is called the type of π). Two
                                             representations are isomorphic if and only if they are of the same type. P
                                                 Given a partition λ let λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . be the parts of λ and let |λ| = i λi . Let
                                             Oλ (k) be the set of all representations of k[[t]] in k |λ| of type λ. If k is algebraically
                                             closedP   then Oλ (k) is an irreducible smooth quasi-projective variety of dimension
                                             oλ = i6=j λi λj . Let oλ (pl ) be the cardinal of Oλ (Fpl ). It is known (cf. [Mac95,
                                             Chapter II]) that oλ (pl ) is a monic polynomial function of pl of degree oλ .
                                                 Let λ, µ1 , . . . , µn , be partitions such that |λ| = |µ1 | + . . . + |µn |. Let Nλµ1 ...µn (k)
                                             be the set of all pairs (π, D) consisting of a representation π of k[[t]] in k |λ| of
                                             type λ and an n-step filtration D = ({0} = D0 ⊂ D1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Dn = k |λ| ) of k |λ|
                                             by subrepresentations of π such that π|Da /Da−1 has type µa for a = 1, . . . , n. If
                                             k is algebraically closed then Nλµ1 ...µn (k) is a quasi-projective variety over k. The
                                             set Nλµ1 ...µn (Fpl ) can be identified with the set of Fpl -rational points in the variety
                                             Nλµ1 ...µn (Fp ).
                                                 Steinitz [Ste01] and Hall [Hal59] observed that the sets Nλµ1 ...µn (k) have some
                                             relation to the theory of symmetric functions, and thus to the representation the-
                                             ory of the general linear and symmetric groups. Given a partition λ such that the
                                             number of non-zero parts of λ is less than (N + 1) let Lλ denote the irreducible
                                             representation of GL(N, C) with the highest weight λ, and given an arbitrary par-
                                             tition λ let ρλ be the irreducible representation of S|λ| over C associated to λ. Let
                                             cλµ1 ...µn be a non-negative integer defined in either of the following two (equivalent)
                                             ways:
                                             (1.1)     cλµ1 ...µn = dimC HomGL(N,C) (Lλ , Lµ1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Lµn ) , or
                                                                                                   S   1   ×...×S|µn |
                                             (1.2)     cλµ1 ...µn = dimC HomS|µ1 | ×...×S|µn | (resS|λ|
                                                                                                    |µ |
                                                                                                                         ρλ , ρµ1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ρµn ) .
                                             In (1.1) it is assumed that the number of non-zero parts of each of the partitions
                                             λ, µ1 , . . . , µn , is less that (N + 1).

    Let v 1 , . . . , v n ∈ Z≥0 , u =       a
                                       a=1 v . Assume k is algebraically closed. Let

fv1 ...vn = a<b v v be the dimension of the projective variety of all n-step partial
flags in k u with dimensions of the subfactors given by v 1 , . . . , v n .
Theorem.
 1.a. If k is algebraically closed then the variety Nλµ1 ...µn (k) is empty or has pure
      dimension
                                    |λ|                                      
              dim Nλµ1 ...µn (k) = f|µ1 |...|µn | + 12 oλ + oµ1 + . . . + oµn .
    1.b. If k is algebraically closed then the number of irreducible components of
         Nλµ1 ...µn (k) is equal to cλµ1 ...µn .
    1.c. There exists a computable polynomial nλµ1 ...µn with integer coefficients such
         that the cardinal of the set Nλµ1 ...µn (Fpl ) is equal to nλµ1 ...µn (pl ) for any prime
         number p and any positive integer l.
    1.d. The polynomial nλµ1 ...µn is identically equal to zero or has degree
                                       |λ|                                      
                     deg nλµ1 ...µn = f|µ1 |...|µn | + 12 oλ + oµ1 + . . . + oµn .
    1.e. The leading coefficient of the polynomial nλµ1 ...µn is equal to cλµ1 ...µn .

Remark. nλµ1 ...µn (x) = oλ (x) hλµ1 ...µn (x), where hλµ1 ...µn is the Hall polynomial (cf.
[Mac95, Chapter II]).
Proof. Statement 1.a is proven by Spaltenstein [Spa82, II.5]; 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are
due to Steinitz [Ste01] and Hall [Hal59] (see also [Mac95, Chapter II]); 1.b follows
from 1.a and 1.e.
   Definitions (1.1) and (1.2) of cλµ1 ...µn are equivalent due to Schur-Weyl duality.
However if one wants to generalize Theorem 1 to reductive groups other than GL(N )
there are various directions. For example certain subvarieties of parabolic flag
varieties play the role of Nλµ1 ...µn for restriction multiplicities in the representation
theory of Weyl groups. In this note some other varieties are considered which are
relevant to tensor product multiplicities. They were independently described by
Nakajima [Nak01], Varagnolo and Vasserot [VV01], and the author [Mal01].
2. A Lie algebra g′ . Let g be a simple simply laced Lie algebra over C and t
be a Cartan subalgebra of g. Let g′ = g ⊕ t (a reductive Lie algebra) and let
t′ = t ⊕ t ⊂ g ⊕ t be a Cartan subalgebra of g′ . Let I be the set of vertices of the
Dynkin graph of g. Identify the weight lattice Qg of g with Z[I] in such a way that
i ∈ I ⊂ Z[I] is the simple weight corresponding to the vertex i. Let Q++   g   = Z≥0 [I]
be the set of positive weights. Fix a lattice Qt in t∗ and identify Qt with Z[I] in some
way. Let Q++ t   = Z≥0 [I]. In what follows representations of g′ are assumed to have
the action of {0} ⊕ t given by elements of the lattice Qt . One has an injective map
κ : Z[I] ⊕ Z[I] → Qg ⊕ Qt given by κ((u, v)) = (u − v, u − v + Av), where A is the
Cartan matrix of g. Let Qg′ be the image of the map κ. In what follows Qg′ is called
the weight lattice of g′ . For ξ ∈ Qg′ ⊂ Qg ⊕Qt let |ξ| denote the Qt -component of ξ.
A weight ξ ∈ Qg′ is called integrable if κ −1 (ξ) ∈ Z≥0 [I] ⊕ Z≥0 [I] ⊂ Z[I] ⊕ Z[I]. Let
Q+                                                ++      +       ++     ++
   g′ be the set of integrable weights, and let Qg′ = Qg′ ∩ (Qg ⊕ Qt ). Elements
      ++
of Qg′ are called positive integrable weights.
    Given λ ∈ Q++                                                                  ′
                  g′ let Lλ be an irreducible highest weight representation of g with
the highest weight λ. The representation Lλ is finite dimensional and all its weights

belong to Q+                                              ′
             g′ . A finite dimensional representation of g is called integrable if all
its irreducible components have positive integrable highest weights. The category
of finite dimensional integrable representations is closed with respect to tensor
product. Let dξη1 ...ηn be a tensor product multiplicity:

                      dξη1 ...ηn = dimC Homg′ (Lξ , Lη1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Lηn ) ,
where ξ, η 1 , . . . , η n ∈ Q++             1              n
                              g′ and |ξ| = |η | + . . . + |η |.

3. An algebra F̃ . Recall that I is the set of vertices of the Dynkin graph of g. Let
H be the set of pairs consisting of an edge of the Dynkin graph together with an
orientation of the edge. Given a field k let F (k) be the path algebra of the Dynkin
graph over k, and let · denote the multiplication in F (k). Fix a map ε : H → {±1}
such that ε(h) = −ε(h), where h denotes the same edge as h but with the opposite
                        P
orientation. Let ϑ = h∈H ε(h)h · h ∈ F (k), and let F̃ (k) be an associative k-
algebra defined as follows. As a k-linear space F̃ (k) = F (k) ⊕ ⊕i∈I kui , where ui
are some symbols, and the multiplication ◦ in F̃ (k) is given by
                   f ◦ f′ = f · ϑ · f′ ,                    f ◦ ui = f · [i] ,
                  ui ◦ uj = δij ui ,                       ui ◦ f = [i] · f ,
where f, f ′ ∈ F (k), i, j ∈ I, [i] ∈ F (k) is the path of length zero beginning and
ending at a vertex i ∈ I, and δij is the Kronecker symbol. The algebra F̃ (k) was
introduced by Lusztig. It is finitely generated as a k-algebra (cf. [Lus00, 2.2]).
    Let k I be a semisimple k-algebra isomorphic to the direct sum of |I| copies of k.
In what follows F (k) and F̃ (k) are considered as k I -algebras with the embedding
of the set of idempotents of k I into F (k) (resp. F̃ (k)) given by {[i]} (resp. {ui }).
    Let D be a k I -module (i.e. Z[I]-graded k-linear space). A representation of F̃ (k)
in D is a k I -algebra homomorphism F̃ (k) → EndkI D. Let Ḋ = F (k) ⊗kI D (cf.
[Lus98, Lus00]). Ḋ is naturally a left F (k)-module. Given a representation π of
F̃ (k) in D let ̟π ∈ HomkI (Ḋ, D) be given by ̟π (f ⊗ d) = π(f )d, and let Kπ be
the maximal F (k)-submodule of Ḋ contained in the kernel of ̟π . Let ξ ∈ Qg′ be
given by ξ = κ((d + v − Av, v)), where d = dimkI D, v = dimkI (Ḋ/Kπ ) (note that
|ξ| = d). Such ξ is called the type of π. Two representations of the same type are
not necessarily isomorphic. Given ξ ∈ Qg′ let Xξ (k) be the set of all representations
of F̃ (k) in k |ξ| of type ξ. It is known (cf. [Nak98], [Lus98, Lus00], [CB00]) that
Xξ (k) is non-empty if and only if ξ ∈ Q++     g′ , and that if k is algebraically closed
then Xξ (k) is empty
                   P     or is an irreducible smooth   quasi-projective variety over k of
dimension xξ = i∈I vi (2|ξ| − Avi ), where (u, v) = κ −1 (ξ).

4. Generalized Hall theorem. Let ξ, η 1 , . . . , η n ∈ Q++                  1              n
                                                                g′ , |ξ| = |η | + . . . + |η |,
and let Pξη1 ...ηn (k) be the set of all pairs (π, D) consisting of a representation π of F̃
in k |ξ| of type ξ and an n-step filtration D = ({0} = D0 ⊂ D1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Dn = k |ξ| )
of k |ξ| by subrepresentations of π such that π|Da /Da−1 has type η a for a = 1, . . . , n.
If k is algebraically closed then Pξη1 ...ηn (k) is a quasi-projective variety over k. The
variety Pξη1 ...ηn (k) is a variant of a “multiplicity variety” of [Mal01]. It is also
implicitly contained in [Nak01] and [VV01]. The set Pξη1 ...ηn (Fpl ) can be identified
with the set of Fpl -rational points in the variety Pξη1 ...ηn (Fp ).

Theorem.
 4.a. If k is algebraically closed then the variety Pξη1 ...ηn (k) is empty or has pure
      dimension
                                    |ξ|                                      

    4.b. If k is algebraically closed then the number of irreducible components of
         Pξη1 ...ηn (k) is equal to dξη1 ...ηn .
    4.c. There exists a computable polynomial pξη1 ...ηn with integer coefficients such
         that the cardinal of the set Pξη1 ...ηn (Fpl ) is equal to pξη1 ...ηn (pl ) for any prime
         number p and any positive integer l.
    4.d. The polynomial pξη1 ...ηn is identically equal to zero or has degree
                                     |ξ|                                       
                   deg pξη1 ...ηn = g|η1 |...|ηn | + 12 xξ + xη1 + . . . + xηn .

    4.e. The leading coefficient of the polynomial pξη1 ...ηn is equal to dξη1 ...ηn .
Proof. Statement 4.a is proven in [Nak01] and [Mal01]. In these papers the base
field k is assumed to be C, but the proofs work for arbitrary algebraically closed
field. 4.b is proven in [Mal01] (it is also a corollary of [Nak01, Lemma 4.4] or [VV01,
Theorem 5.3]). Statements 4.d and 4.e follow from 4.a, 4.b, and 4.c.
    To prove 4.c one can use the inductive argument in [Lus00, 6.6] replacing the
variety (notation of [Lus00]) Λs,∗s             s           λ
                                 D,V (resp. ΛD,V ) by Pµ1 ...µn (resp. a tensor product
variety – cf. [Mal01]). To prove that the number of Fpl -rational points of a tensor
product variety depends polynomially on pl note (cf. [Mal01]) that a tensor product
variety is a finite union of disjoint subsets each of which is a vector bundle over
a fibration with the base equal to a Z[I]-graded partial flag variety and fibers
isomorphic to ΛsD1 ,V1 ;U1 × . . . × ΛsDn ,Vn ;Un for some D1 , . . . , Dn , V1 , . . . , Vn ,
U1 , . . . , Un (again notation of [Lus00]). Thus it follows from [Lus00, Section 6]
that the number of Fpl -rational points of a tensor product variety is given by a
computable polynomial in pl .
Remark. The Hall polynomials hλµ1 µ2 (cf. Section 1) give structure constants of the
Hecke algebra of GL(N ) in the basis of characteristic functions of the double cosets.
The author does not know what connection (if any) exists between the polynomials
pξη1 η2 and the Hecke algebra (of an extension of the algebraic group associated to
g by its Cartan subgroup).
5. AN −1 case. In this section it is explained why Theorem 1 is a special case of
Theorem 4. The argument is quite standard (cf. [KP79]). Throughout the section
g is assumed to be slN , and the set of vertices I of its Dynkin graph is identified
with {1, 2, . . . , N − 1} in such a way that two vertices are connected by an edge if
and only if they are consequent integers.
   Note that in the definition (1.1) of cλµ1 ...µn the number of non-zero parts of each of
the partitions λ, µ1 , . . . , µn , is assumed to be less than (N +1). Thus representations
of k[[t]] involved in the definition of Nλµ1 ...µn (k) factor through k[[t]]/k N k[[t]].
               A GENERALIZATION OF HALL POLYNOMIALS TO ADE CASE                                5


   Recall that [1] ∈ F (k) denotes the path of length zero beginning and ending at
the vertex 1.
Proposition. Let I be a two-sided ideal of F̃ (k) generated by u2 , u3 , . . . , uN −1 .
 5.a. The factor algebra F̃ (k)/I is generated as a k-algebra by (u1 +I) and ([1]+I).
 5.b. [1] ◦ [1] ◦ . . . ◦ [1] ∈ I .
      |        {z           }
                N
  5.c. A k-algebra homomorphism ϕ : k[[t]]/tN k[[t]] → F̃ (k)/I uniquely defined
       by ϕ(1 + tN k[[t]]) = u1 + I and ϕ(t + tN k[[t]]) = [1] + I is an isomorphism.
Proof. 5.a and 5.b are straightforward. Due to 5.b the map ϕ is well-defined, and
due to 5.a it is surjective. According to [KP79] there exists a faithful representation
of k[[t]]/tN k[[t]] which factors through ϕ. Thus ϕ is injective. 5.c follows.
   Note that a representation of F̃ (k) factors through F̃ (k)/I if and only if its
type η satisfies the condition: |η|i = 0 for i = 2, . . . , N − 1. Given such η let
(u, v) = κ −1 (η) and let ν(η) be an N -tuple of integers given by ν(η)1 = |η|1 − v1 ,
ν(η)i = vi−1 − vi for i = 2, . . . , N − 1, and ν(η)N = vN −1 . One has η ∈ Q++        g′
if and only if ν(η) is an ordered partition (i.e. 0 ≤ ν(η)i ≤ ν(η)j for any i ≥ j).
Thus ν provides a bijection between types of representations of F̃ (k)/I and those
of k[[t]]/tN k[[t]]. Moreover if a representation π of F̃ (k)/I is of type η then the
representation πϕ of k[[t]]/tN k[[t]] is of type ν(η), and one has the following bijection
(isomorphism of varieties if k is algebraically closed):
                                                 ν(ξ)
                              Pξη1 ...ηn (k) ≃ Nν(η1 )...ν(ηn ) (k) .
Therefore Theorem 1 follows from Theorem 4.
