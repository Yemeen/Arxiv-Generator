                                                    Abstract. This paper constructs pavings by affine spaces for the affine Springer
                                                    fibers for P GL(3) obtained from regular compact elements in a split maximal
                                                    torus. These pavings are constructed by intersecting the affine Springer fiber
                                                    with a non-standard paving of the affine Grassmannian.




                                               Let k be a field, F = k((π)) be the field of formal Laurent series over k, O = k[[π]]
                                            be the subring of formal power series, and P = πO be the maximal ideal. Let
                                            G = P GL3 (F ) and K = P GL3 (O). We write X for the affine Grassmannian G/K
                                            and A for the diagonal maximal torus in G.
                                               In section 2.2 we develop for each integer a ≥ 0 a non-standard paving of X
                                            by affine spaces, referred to as the a-paving of X. These non-standard pavings
                                            are constructed using the standard Iwahori subgroup I and a conjugate of it, I a ,
                                            that depends on a. Each affine space in an a-paving is a union of intersections of
                                            I-orbits and I a -orbits in X. In particular, the affine spaces are preserved by I ∩ I a
                                            and hence by its subgroup A(O).
                                               Each affine space in an a-paving contains exactly one element of X∗ (A) and thus
                                            these lattice points index the affine spaces. This is analogous to how affine spaces
                                            are indexed in the standard paving of X by I-orbits. In fact, when a = 0 the
                                            a-paving of X is identical to the standard affine paving of X by I-orbits.
                                               An a-paving differs from the standard paving of X by I-orbits in how the closure
                                            of each affine space relates to the paving. In the standard paving, the closure of an
                                            affine space is the union of smaller dimensional affine spaces. For all a other than
                                            zero, our a-paving is a paving in a weaker sense. The closure of each affine space
                                            is not necessarily the union of other affine spaces in the paving. However, we can
                                            order the affine spaces A0 , A1 , A2 , . . . so that A0 ∪ · · · ∪ An is closed for all n.
                                               Our non-standard pavings are interesting because they induce affine pavings of
                                            certain fixed point sets in X. Specifically, when γ is a regular element in A(O) the
                                            set
                                                                          X γ = {g ∈ G/K : γg = g}
                                            admits a paving by affine spaces when intersected with a particular a-paving of X
                                            that is determined by γ. The set X γ is called an affine Springer fiber. They were
                                            first studied by Kazhdan and Lusztig in [KL88].
                                                The value of a that induces an affine paving of X γ is determined as follows. We
                                            use v(x) to denote the valuation of x ∈ F and we take v(0) = +∞. Now γ has the

Main Theorem. The intersection of X γ with the a-paving of X determined by
a = n − m yields an affine paving of X γ . In particular, the intersection of X γ with
each affine space in the a-paving of X is an affine space.
   To prove the result, we explicitly calculate the intersection of X γ with the affine
spaces of the a-paving of X in section 3. The precise statement of the main theorem
is Theorem 1.1.
   Many other authors have found affine pavings of affine Springer fibers for specific
groups with an equivalued condition on the valuation of roots [Fan96] [LW] [LS91]
[Sag00] [Som97]. Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson proved a general result that
gives an affine paving of affine Springer fibers for any connected reductive group
assuming the equivalued condition [GKM]. This paper develops the first known
affine paving of an affine Springer fiber in the non-equivalued case.
   We conjecture that this method can be extended to prove the same result when
k is algebraically closed, char(k) 6= 2, and the maximal torus splits as E × × F ×
where E/F is a quadratic extension. Provided this is true, in P GL(3) an affine
paving of X γ is known for all regular semisimple γ except in characteristic 2 and 3.
In the case of the torus E × where E/F is a cubic extension, n and m are forced to
be equal and in characteristic other than 2 and 3 [GKM] applies. ([GKM] actually
applies to the Lie algebra of G, but the result is equivalent for the group.)
   I wish to thank my advisor Robert Kottwitz for suggesting this problem and for
his generous help.

1. Notation, Definitions, & Precise Statement of the Main Theorem
   An element of X that has a diagonal matrix coset representative can be ex-
pressed in terms of a diagonal matrix with monomial entries. That representative
is equivalent in G to an element of the form
                                               

We denote such elements of X by the coordinates (s, t). (These points are the
vertices in the main apartment of the building for G.)

   The subgroup I a acts on points of X by left multiplication. This action fixes
the point (a, a), which we call the base point relative to a. For a particular I a , the
other points (s, t) in the main apartment of X can be divided into 12 types based
on the relationship of a and the coordinates (s, t).

Figure 1 shows how the vertices in the main apartment are partitioned into the
twelve types relative to I 0 . For simplicity, we only label the vertices corresponding
to elements in SL3 (F ).
                                                                3
   Every point in X is in the I a -orbit of some point in the main apartment. This
gives a decomposition of X into disjoint sets
                                       G
                               X=           I a xK / K
                                           x∈vert

where vert is the set of vertices (s, t).
  To pave X by affine spaces, we first divide X into three disjoint sets
              G                                             G
  S=                    IxK / K,                 T =                   IxK / K,
       x type 10 , 20 , or 30                                  x type 50 , 60 , or 70

and
                                       V = X \ (S ∪ T ).

The intersection of the I -orbit of a vertex v with the set S is denoted by
                                      Sva = S ∩ I a vK / K
with analogous notation Tva for the set T and Vva for the set V. In the course of
proving the main theorem, we will show that the sets Vv0 , Sva and Tva are affine
spaces and together they give a non-standard paving of X by affine spaces.
   We now state the main theorem.
Theorem 1.1. Let a = n − m. The sets X γ ∩ Vv0 , X γ ∩ Sva , X γ ∩ Tva are affine
spaces that form an affine paving of X γ as v ranges over the vertices in the main
apartment of X.

                                2. Understanding I a -orbits
   The sets S and T are defined by I-orbits of vertices, but the main theorem utilizes
sets that are defined in part by the I a -orbits of those vertices. This motivates us
to analyze the relationship of I-orbits and I a -orbits.
   To begin, we find a unique matrix coset representative for each point in the I a -
orbit of a vertex (s, t). With this enumeration of points, we can explicitly describe
how I and I a -orbits compare.
2.1. Enumerating Cosets. Consider the I a -orbit of the vertex x = (s, t),
                     I a xK / K = I a I a ∩ xKx−1 .

For an arbitrary matrix         in k ∈ K the conjugate xkx−1    is
                                                                      

We are interested in the intersection

                                      I(s,t) = I a ∩ xKx−1 .
The matrix form of this intersection depends upon the type of x relative to a. For
example, when x is type 1a (s < a < t)

    So each coset in I a I(s,t)  (when s < a < t) can be represented using a triple
(i, y, z) by factoring M as above. In fact, each triple represents a unique coset.
To see this, suppose the cosets represented by (i, y, z) and (i′ , y ′ , z ′ ) are equivalent,
then

−s. Similarly, we have y = y ′ and z ′ = z. So the set of matrices of the form

A matrix M that represents a point in the I a -orbit of a vertex of type r is said to
be in standard form if the diagonal entries of M are one and the other entries of M
follow the specification for type r in the above table. When referring to a point M ,
we will also refer to particular values in the standard form of M via the variables
iM , jM , kM , xM , yM , zM . For example, if M is a point in the I a -orbit of a vertex of
type 1a , then the jM = 0 and zM ∈ P P t−s .
2.2. Stationary & Non-stationary Points. Given a point M in the I-orbit of
a vertex v, we want to find the I a -orbit that contains M . If M is in the I a -orbit of
v, we call the point stationary; otherwise the point is called non-stationary. When
a = 0, all points are stationary and the a-paving is identical to the paving of X by
I-orbits. So throughout this section we assume a > 0.
    Since we only consider the intersection of I a -orbits with the sets S and T , we
only need to compare the I and I a -orbits for vertices of type 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 , 60 , and
70 .
2.2.1. v is Type 10 , 20 , or 30 . This section is devoted to proving the following
lemma. Recall that we denote the valuation of the y component of the standard
enumeration of the point M in the I-orbit of a vertex by v(yM ).
Lemma 2.1. Let M be a point in the I-orbit of the vertex v = (s, t).

    (a) If v is type 20 or 30 then M is stationary
    (b) If v is type 10 and v(yM ) > a then M is stationary
    (c) If v is type 10 and v(yM ) ≤ a then M is in the I a -orbit of w = (s−d, t−2d)
        where d = t − v(yM )
  Part (a) & (b): M is stationary if          M ∈ I ∩ I a . Since

we see that any M representing a point in the I-orbit of a vertex of type 20 , 30 , or
10 with v(yM ) > a is in I ∩ I a and so M is stationary.
   Part (c): Since 0 < v(yM ) < t, we have d > 0, which can be thought of as the
distance between v and w. To show that M is in the I a -orbit of w, it suffices to
find M ′ in I a such that
                                    M ′ w ∈ M vK.
For simplicity we wish to work with matrices rather than matrices modulo scalars.
Since det(w) = s + t − 3d and det(v) = s + t, we replace w with the equivalent
element π d w and thus consider
                                      π d M ′ w ∈ M vK.
Rearranging terms yields
                                M −1 M ′ ∈ π −d vKw−1 .
Since π −d vKw−1   is the set of matrices of the form
                                        P −s P d−t
                               −d                      

                                 P      P       Pd

with determinant a unit and det(M −1 M ′ ) is a unit, the condition on M ′ reduces
to
                                          P −s P d−t
                                −d                        
                                 P
                    M −1 M ′ ∈  P s−d O          P s−t+d  .
                                 P t−d P t−s P d
To compute the matrix form of the left side, we need to know the standard form
for M ′ , which is determined by w’s type relative to I a . Later, it will be convenient
to also know w’s type relative to I.
Lemma 2.2. Suppose that v = (s, t) is type 10 and 1 ≤ v(y) ≤ min(a, t−1). Define
d = t − v(y). Then w = (s − d, t − 2d) is type 3a and either type 10 , 20 , or 30 .
  Proof. The inequalities
                           (s − d) < 0    and (s − d) < (t − 2d)
                   0   0        0
imply w is type 1 , 2 , or 3 and
                                    (s − d) < (t − 2d) < a
                                                 7
implies w is type 3a .
   By assumption, v(y) ≤ min(a, t − 1) so v(y) < t and thus d ≥ 1. Since v is type
10 we know s < 0. Therefore the inequality (s − d) < 0 is clear.
   The inequality (s − d) < (t − 2d) is equivalent to s < v(y) which follows from
s < 0 < 1 ≤ v(y). Finally, the inequality (t − 2d) < a is equivalent to 2v(y) < a + t
which follows from v(y) ≤ a and v(y) ≤ t − 1 < t.
   We can now compute M −1 M ′ . To simplify notation, we use i = iM , i′ = iM ′ ,
and similar simplifications for the other variables. Note that
                                                  
                                         1 i 0

  Because w is type 3a we will look for M ′ ∈ I a of the form
                                                 

   Thus the point M in the I-orbit of v is also represented by M ′ in the I a -orbit
of w.
   We noted that for a non-stationary point the corresponding w was of type 10 ,
2 , or 30 . This shows that when we rearrange elements of S by I a -orbits, any
 0

non-stationary point is in the I a -orbit of a vertex in S.

   Proof. It is clear from the definition of Sva that Sva ⊂ S.
   Let M ∈ S. Then for some v of type 10 , 20 , or 30
                                            M ∈ IvK / K.
  If M is stationary, then M ∈          Sva .
                                      Otherwise, M is non-stationary and there is a
w of type 10 , 20 , or 30 such that M ∈ Sw

2.2.2. Structure of Sva for v of Type 10 , 20 , or 30 . In the last section, we categorized
the points of S as stationary and non-stationary. Given a vertex v of type 10 , 20 , or
30 , we already know which points in Sva are stationary. To complete the description
of Sva , we need to determine the non-stationary points in the set.
    When v is type 1a or 2a the only points in Sva are stationary points because
non-stationary move to I a -orbits of type 3a vertices. Since only type 10 vertices
can be type 1a or 2a , we can simply apply the stationary condition v(y) > a to the
elements in the enumeration of points in the I-orbit of a vertex of type 10 to find
Sva in this case. Therefore, when v is type 1a or 2a , we have s < a ≤ t and Sva is
enumerated by

                                   i ∈ O P −s

   When v is type 3a , the situation is more complicated because non-stationary
points move into I a -orbits of these vertices. Further complicating the situation is
the fact that v can be type 10 , 20 , or 30 and so the enumeration of the stationary
points is different in each case.
                                                     9
   To list the stationary points, first suppose that v is type 3a and either type 10 or
type 20 . Then s < 0 ≤ t < a. If v is type    0
                                         t 2 , then y = 0. Otherwise the stationary
condition v(y) > a applied to y ∈ P P forces y = 0. So the stationary points in
Sva are given by

                                    i ∈ O P −s

  When v is type 3a and 30 , s < t < 0 < a and all the points are stationary

                                i ∈ O P −s

   For each positive integer d, there are non-stationary points in S that contribute
to the I a -orbit of v = (s, t) if v is type 3a and
    (a) w = (s + d, t + 2d) is a type 10
    (b) there exists M ∈ IwK / K so that v(y) ≤ a and d = (t + 2d) − v(y) (where
        y ≡ yM ).
Condition (a) locates the vertex of the source of the non-stationary points corre-
sponding to the particular value of d. The second condition identifies non-stationary
points that move from vertex w to vertex v.
   We can reduce condition (b) by first simplifying the equality in (b) to see that
d = v(y) − t. Because 0 < d we must have 0 < v(y) − t, or equivalently, t + 1 ≤ v(y).
With the inequality from (b) we have

                                  t + 1 ≤ v(y) ≤ a.                               (2.2)

Condition (a) translates to the inequality

                                 s + d < 0 < t + 2d.                              (2.3)

These two inequalities have slightly different implications depending on the type of
v.
   When v is type 10 we have s < 0 < t so the right side of (2.3) is trivial since
0 < d. The left side is equivalent to s + v(y) − t < 0 or v(y) < t − s. Combining
this with (2.2) results in

                          t + 1 ≤ v(y) ≤ min(a, t − s − 1).                       (2.4)
                           0    0
   Otherwise, v tis type 2 or 3 and so s < t ≤ 0. The left side of (2.2) is trivial
since y ∈ P P , so that inequality can be replaced with 1 ≤ v(y) ≤ a. Replacing
d with v(y) − t changes (2.3) to s + v(y) − t < 0 < t + 2(v(y) − t). The right side is
again trivial since v(y) > 0 and t ≤ 0. To satisfy the left side, we need v(y) < t − s.
Combining this with the modified inequality from (2.2) gives

                            1 ≤ v(y) ≤ min(a, t − s − 1).                         (2.5)

    Provided y satisfies inequality (2.4) when v is type 10 or inequality (2.5) when v
is type 20 or 30 , there are non-stationary points in the I-orbit of w = (s + d, t + 2d)
that move to the I a -orbit of v. For all the y of a fixed allowable valuation, the
                                           10

where v(j) = −v(y) since j = 1/y. Thus the non-stationary points correspond to

− min(a, t−s−1) when v is type 10 . These points fit very nicely with the stationary

2.2.3. v is Type 50 , 60 , or 70 . This section and the next parallel 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.
As before, we first prove
Lemma 2.5. Let M be a point in the I-orbit of the vertex v = (s, t).
    (a) If v is type 50 or 60 then M is stationary
    (b) If v is type 70 and v(xM ) > a then M is stationary
    (c) If v is type 70 and v(xM ) ≤ a then M is in the I a -orbit of w = (s−2d, t−d)
        where d = s − v(xM )
  Part (a) & (b): M is stationary if M ∈ I ∩ I a . From 2.2.1 we know that
                               ×                    

It is easy to see that any M representing a point in the I-orbit of a vertex of type
50 , 60 , or 70 with v(xM ) > a is in I ∩ I a and so M is stationary.
    Part (c): Since 0 < v(xM ) < s, we have the distance d between v and w greater
than zero. To show that M is in the I a -orbit of w, it suffices to find M ′ in I a such
that
                                      M ′ w ∈ M vK.

                                                P d−s

To compute the matrix form of the left side, we need to know the standard form
for M ′ , which is determined by w’s type relative to I a .
Lemma 2.6. Suppose that v = (s, t) is type 70 and 1 ≤ v(x) ≤ min(a, s − 1).
Define d = s − v(x). Then w = (s − 2d, t − d) is type 5a and either type 50 , 60 , or
70 .
  Proof. The inequalities
                        (t − d) < 0 and (t − d) < (s − 2d)
imply w is type 50 , 60 , or 70 and
                                (t − d) < (s − 2d) < a
implies that w is type 5a .
   By assumption, v(x) ≤ min(a, s − 1) so v(x) < s and thus d ≥ 1. Since v is type
70 we know t < 0. Therefore the inequality (t − d) < 0 is clear.
   The inequality (t − d) < (s − 2d) is equivalent to t < v(x) which follows from
t < 0 < 1 ≤ v(x). Finally, the inequality (s − 2d) < a is equivalent to 2v(x) < a + s
which follows from v(x) ≤ a and v(x) ≤ s − 1 < s.
   We now compute M −1 M ′ .
   Because w is type 5a ,
                                                   

   Thus the point M in the I-orbit of v is also represented by M ′ in the I a -orbit
of w.
   We showed that for a non-stationary point the corresponding w was of type 50 ,
6 , or 70 . This shows that when we rearrange elements of T by I a -orbits, any
 0

non-stationary point is in the I a -orbit of a vertex in T .
Corollary 2.7.                                     G
                                    T =                            Tva
                                          v type 50 , 60 , or 70

  Proof. It is clear from the definition of Tva that Tva ⊂ T .
  Let M ∈ T . Then for some v of type 50 , 60 , or 70
                                          M ∈ IvK / K.
  If M is stationary, then M ∈ Tva . Otherwise, M is non-stationary and there is a
w of type 50 , 60 , or 70 such that M ∈ Twa .
2.2.4. Structure of Tva for v Type 50 , 60 , or 70 . In the previous section, we cate-
gorized the points of T as stationary and non-stationary. Given a vertex v of type
50 , 60 , or 70 , we already know which points in Tva are stationary. To complete the
description of Tva , we need to determine the non-stationary points in the set.
    When v is type 7a or 6a the only points in Tva are stationary points because
non-stationary move to the I a -orbit of type 5a vertices. Since only type 70 vertices
                                                  13
can be type 7a or 6a , we can simply apply the stationary condition v(x) > a to the
elements in the enumeration of points in the I-orbit of a vertex of type 70 to find
Tva in this case. Therefore, when v is type 7a or 6a , we have t < a ≤ s and Tva is
enumerated by
                                          
                                 j ∈ O P −t
                                 k ∈ O P s−t
                                          

                                 x ∈ P a+1 P s .
                                              

   Now we consider the case when v is type 5a . To list the stationary points, first
suppose that v is type 5a and either type 70 or type 60 . Then t < 0 ≤ s < a. If
v is type 60 , then x = 0. Otherwise the stationary condition v(x) > a applied to
x ∈ P / P s forces x = 0. So the stationary points in Tva are given by
                                           
                                  j ∈ O P −t
                                 k ∈ O P s−t .
                                           

  When v is type 5a and 50 , t < s < 0 < a and all the points are stationary
                                         
                                i ∈ O P −s
                                         
                                j ∈ O P −t
                                k ∈ O P s−t .
                                         

   For each positive integer d, there are non-stationary points in T that contribute
to the I a -orbit of v = (s, t) if v is type 5a and
   (a) w = (s + 2d, t + d) is a type 70
   (b) there exists M ∈ IwK / K so that v(x) > a and d = (s + 2d) − v(x) (where
       x ≡ xM ).
Condition (a) locates the vertex of the source of the non-stationary points corre-
sponding to the particular value of d. The second condition identifies non-stationary
points that move from vertex w to vertex v.
   We can reduce condition (b) by first simplifying the equality in (b) to see that
d = v(x)−s. Because 0 < d we must have 0 < v(x)−s, or equivalently, s+1 ≤ v(x).
With the inequality from (b) we have
                                 s + 1 ≤ v(x) ≤ a.                               (2.7)
Condition (a) translates to the inequality
                                 t + d < 0 < s + 2d.                             (2.8)
These two inequalities have slightly different implications depending on the type of
v.
   When v is type 70 we have t < 0 < s so the right side of (2.8) is trivial since
0 < d. The left side is equivalent to t + v(x) − s < 0 or v(x) < s − t. Combining
this with (2.7) results in
                          s + 1 ≤ v(x) ≤ min(a, s − t − 1).                      (2.9)
   Otherwise, v is type 60 or 50 and so t < s ≤ 0. The left side of (2.7) is trivial
since x ∈ P / P s , so that inequality can be replaced with 1 ≤ v(x) ≤ a. Replacing
d with v(x) − s changes (2.8) to t + v(x) − s < 0 < s + 2(v(x) − s). The right side is
                                          14
again trivial since v(x) > 0 and s ≤ 0. To satisfy the left side, we need v(x) < s − t.
Combining this with the modified inequality from (2.7) gives
                                1 ≤ v(x) ≤ min(a, s − t − 1).                      (2.10)
                                                               0
    Provided x satisfies inequality (2.9) when v is type 7 or inequality (2.10) when v
is type 60 or 50 , there are non-stationary points in the I-orbit of w = (s + 2d, t + d)
that move to the I a -orbit of v. For all the x of a fixed allowable valuation, the
non-stationary points in Tva are enumerated by
                              .
                    k ∈ O P (s+2d)−(t+d)−d = O P s−t

                              .
                    j ∈ O P d−(t+d) = P P −t

                                      .                       .
                    i ∈ P d−(s+2d) P 2d−(s+2d) = P −v(x) P −s
where v(i) = −v(x) since i = 1/x. Thus the non-stationary points correspond to
−1 ≥ v(i) ≥ − min(a, s − t − 1) when v is type 60 or 50 and −(s + 1) ≥ v(i) ≥
− min(a, s−t−1) when v is type 70 . These points fit very nicely with the stationary
points at v to give Tva enumerated by
                                k ∈ O P s−t

                          3. Proof of the Main Theorem
   In this section, we show that the sets X γ ∩ Sva , X γ ∩ Tva , and X γ ∩ Vv0 are affine
spaces by explicit calculation. Since the standard form of the matrices representing
points in X vary depending on the type of v, we proceed case by case through
the twelve types. The next section outlines the general approach and the following
sections applies the technique to specific regions.
3.1.
   Fix Point Conditions. Let v = (s, t) and M be a point in IvK / K =
I I(s,t) . M is in X γ if γM = M . Since γ ∈ I(s,t) , we can replace γM with γM γ −1
which has the advantage of preserving the standard form of M . Thus M is fixed if
and only if γM γ −1 ∈ M I(s,t) or equivalently if
                                     M −1 γM γ −1 ∈ I(s,t) .                        (3.1)
Immediately, we see that any vertex in the main apartment is fixed since M is the
identity in that case.
                                                    15
    The matrix form of (3.1) depends upon the standard form of M and thus v’s
type. For each of the six vertex types in V , we write M in standard form for
that vertex type and compute the left side of (3.1). We then analyze the resulting
expression to determine X γ ∩ Vv0 . In the cases when v is in Sva or Tva we proceed in
a similar fashion except the sets I and I(s,t) are replaced with I a and I(s,t)
                                                                          a

3.2. X γ ∩ Vv0 . The set V contains vertices of type 40 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 , and 120 . In
the following sections, the fixed point condition is applied to the I-orbits of these
vertex types and the dimension of the resulting affine space is determined.

space of dimension min(m, −s)+min(m, −t). The variable i contributes min(m, −s)
to the dimension and the variable j contributes min(m, −t) to the dimension.

Thus M is fixedif and only if v(j) ≥ −t − m and v(k) ≥ s − t − n.

  Therefore, when v is in T and type 5a the set X γ ∩ Tva is an affine space of
dimension min(m, −t) + min(n, s − t)) + min(m, a − s, −t − 1).

                         4. Topological Considerations
  In the previous sections, we developed a decomposition of X γ into affine pieces.
We now examine the topology of the decomposition to verify it is a paving by affine
spaces.
4.1. Locally Closed. To show that the affine pieces of X γ are locally closed, it is
enough to show that the sets Vv0 , Sva , and Tva are locally closed. Every Vv0 set is
simply an I-orbit of a vertex and thus locally closed.
   From Lemma 2.4 we know that Sva is a closed affine subspace of I a vK / K,
which is locally closed because it is the I a -orbit of v, and thus Sva is locally closed.
Similarly, from Lemma 2.8 we can conclude that Tva is locally closed.
4.2. A Filtration by Closed Sets. In this section, we exhibit a filtration of X
by closed subsets that are formed by an increasing union of the affine pieces of
X described in the previous sections. Since the affine pieces are in a one-to-one
correspondence with the vertices in the main apartment of X, we can describe the
filtration by placing an order on those vertices. If vi = (s, t) is the i-th vertex, let
Ai denote the affine space containing vi and then
                                  A0 ⊂ A0 ∪ A1 ⊂ . . .
will give the filtration.
    The base point v0 = (0, 0) is a single point and the first closed subset in our
filtration. To describe the order on the remaining vertices, we first coarsely group
the vertices into increasingly larger sets defined by triangular bounds as in figure 2.
The smallest triangle, ∆1 , represents a set of four vertices (three on the boundary
and the base point v0 ). Triangle ∆2 is the next largest and it represents the set of
six vertices on its boundary plus the four vertices from ∆1 . We define ∆0 = {v0 }.

                          Figure 2. Triangular grouping of vertices

   The set of points formed by the union of the affine spaces in the a-paving that
are indexed by the vertices in ∆i is equal to the set of points in the union of I-
orbits of vertices in ∆i . To see this, we first refer to Lemma 2.1. In that lemma,
we prove that some non-stationary points originate from the I-orbit of a type 10
vertex and move to the I a -orbit of a type 1a , 2a , or 3a vertex. Relative to ∆i , these
non-stationary points move along the upper edge of ∆i excluding the vertices of
the triangle. (See figure 3.) In Lemma 2.5, we prove the other possibility is that

        Figure 3. The movement of non-stationary points in ∆5 for a = 3

non-stationary points originate from the I-orbit of a type 70 vertex and move to
                                                                 25
the I a -orbit of a type 5a , 6a , or 7a vertex. Relative to ∆i , these non-stationary
points move along the lower edge of ∆i again excluding the vertices of the triangle.
    We will now show that if the union of the affine spaces indexed by the vertices
v0 , v1 , . . . , vl in ∆i−1 is closed then there is at least one way to order the vertices
vl+1 , vl+2 , . . . , vk on the boundary of ∆i , such that
                                                            k

are all closed. Since ∆0 only contains v0 and we know that A0 is closed, we can
proceed by induction and order all the vertices of X.
   Assume the union of the affine spaces indexed by the vertices in ∆i−1 is closed.
We will describe a valid order for the vertices on the boundary of ∆i in three stages.
Figure 4 graphically depicts the three stages.

               Figure 4. Three stages in ordering the vertices of ∆i

   In stage (i), we add the vertices along the vertical edge of ∆i excluding the
two vertices at the ends of this edge. These vertices can be ordered so that the
dimensions of the associated affine spaces forms a weakly increasing sequence. To
validate the order, we must show that for each vi in stage (i) the set
                                              i
                                              [
                                                    Aj
                                              j=0

is closed. We will use the geometry of minimal galleries to show the union is closed.
    Suppose that vi is a vertex from stage (i). Take a minimal gallery M connecting
v to the base alcove (the alcove stabilized by I). We can express M as a word of
                                                  26
simple reflections M = s1 . . . sj . Each subword of M represents a vertex in X. If
every subword of M represents a vertex that is in
                                          i−1
                                          [
                                                Aj
                                          j=0

then
                                          i
                                          [
                                                Aj
                                          j=0
is closed.
   Since each affine space associated to a vertex in stage (i) is simply the I-orbit of
that vertex, the dimension of the affine space is the length of the minimal gallery
connecting the vertex to the alcove stabilized by I. Thus, we are proposing that
the vertices in stage (i) can ordered by the length of the minimal gallery associated
to the vertex. By considering the possible subwords of a minimal gallery associated
to a vertex in stage (i), we see that the vertex represented by the subword is either
another stage (i) vertex or a vertex in ∆i−1 . See figure 5. Since we order the
vertices in stage (i) by the length of the associated minimal gallery, the proposed
order is valid.

    In stage (ii), we can use the dimension of the I a -orbit of each vertex to order
the vertices. To prove this, it is enough to show that the union Y of the affine
spaces associated to ∆i−1 , stage (i), and stage (ii) is closed. Then, since the union
of the affine spaces associated to ∆i−1 and stage (i) is closed, the union of the
affine spaces associated to stage (ii) is open in Y . Therefore, we can work in the
topological subspace defined by the union of the affine spaces associated to stage
(ii). Each of those affine spaces is a subspace of the I a -orbit of the associated
vertex. Hence, if we order the vertices such that the dimension the I a -orbit of each
vertex increases, the order is valid.
    To prove that the union of the affine spaces associated to ∆i−1 , stage (i), and
stage (ii) is closed, we use the fact that the union of the affine spaces associated to
the vertices in the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of a vertex δ is closed. If we
let δ be the vertex in stage (ii) that is adjacent to the top most geometric vertex
of ∆i , then from figure 6 we can see the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of δ is
the set of vertices in ∆i−1 , stage (i), and stage (ii).

   Stage (iii) is the three geometric vertices of ∆i . Since the union of the affine
spaces indexed by the vertices in ∆i is identical to the union on the I-orbits of those
vertices and since the affine spaces associated to the vertices from stage (iii) are I-
orbits of those vertices, we can simply order those vertices such that the dimensions
of the associated affine spaces forms a weakly increasing sequence.
   In figure 7, the vertices of ∆9 are numbered according to the order we just de-
scribed. In stage (ii), some I a -orbits have the same dimension so figure 7 gives
one of several valid orderings. Note that the smallest numbers are along the ver-
tical edge, which corresponds to stage (i), and the three largest numbers label the
geometric vertices of ∆9 , which corresponds to stage (iii). Further, the vertices in
stage (ii) are labeled in order of increasing dimension of the associated I a -orbit of
the vertex (which is equal to the length of a minimal gallery between the vertex
and the alcove stabilized by I a ).
