                                                   Abstract. Let G be a connected algebraic group defined over a finite field Fq . For
                                                   each irreducible character ρ of G(Fqr ), we denote by mr (ρ) the multiplicity of 1G(Fq )
                                                   in the restriction of ρ to G(Fq ). In the case where G is reductive with connected
                                                   center and is simple modulo center, Kawanaka determined m2 (ρ) for almost all cases,
                                                   and then Lusztig gave a general formula for m2 (ρ). In the case where the center of
                                                   G is not connected, such a result is not known. In this paper we determine m2 (ρ),
                                                   up to some minor ambiguity, in the case where G is the special linear group.
                                                      We also discuss, for any r ≥ 2, the relationship between mr (ρ) with the theory of
                                                   Shintani descent in the case where G is a connected algebraic group.

                                                  Let G be a connected reductive group defined over a finite field Fq with Frobenius
                                                                                       2
                                            map F . We consider the finite group GF and its subgroup GF . The quotient space
                                                2
                                            GF /GF is regarded as an analogue of the symmetric space, and is called the subfield
                                                                                                                               2
                                            symmetric space over a finite field. The determination of spherical functions of GF /GF
                                            is almost equivalent to the determination of irreducible characters of the Hecke algebra
                                                    2                                    2
                                            H(GF , GF ). For a class function f on GF , we denote by m2 (f ) the inner product of
                                                                                     F2
                                            ρ with the induced character IndG    GF 1. The classification of irreducible characters of
                                                  F2   F
                                            H(G , G ) and the determination of their degrees are equivalent to the determination
                                                                                             2
                                            of m2 (ρ) for all irreducible characters ρ of GF .
                                                 In [K2], Kawanaka computed m2 (ρ) in the case where G is a classical group with
                                            connected center, or in the case where ρ is unipotent and the characteristic is good.
                                            Extending Kawanaka’s result, Lusztig gave in [L3] a closed formula for m2 (ρ) valid for
                                            any G which has the connected center and is simple modulo its center. He expects that
                                            his formula is still valid for G with disconnected center. In turn, Henderson studied in
                                                                               2
                                            [H] the spherical functions of GF /GF by making use of the theory of perverse sheaves,
                                                                                                                     2
                                            and described them in the case where G = GLn , in which case H(GF , GF ) is abelian.
                                                 In this paper, we consider G = SLn with the standard Fq -structure, which is
                                            the first example of the disconnected center case. Based on the parametrization of
                                            irreducible characters and the description of almost characters in [S3] (which is valid
                                            under some restriction on p, for example, p ≥ n), we determine m2 (ρ) (Theorem 5.3) for
                                            any irreducible characters, up to some minor ambiguity. Our result is consistent with

Lusztig’s conjectural formula modulo the ambiguity. In particular, we have m2 (ρ) ∈
{0, 1, 2}.
    Kawanaka’s main idea for the computation of m2 (ρ), beside the use of the results
of Lusztig on m2 (RT (θ)), is to connect it with the twisted Frobenius-Schur indicator
through the twisting operator. In section 1, we generalize Kawanaka’s result, and
discuss a connection of m2 (ρ) with Shintani descent. This leads to a formula for
                                                    2
m2 (Rx ) where Rx is an almost character of GF , which is regarded as a counter part
of Lusztig’s formula for m2 (χA ) in [L3, 7], where χA is the characteristic function
of character sheaves. In section 1, we also discuss a more general situation. We
                                                                         r
define mr (ρ) as the multiplicity of an irreducible character ρ of GF with the induced
               Fr
character IndGGF 1 for any integer r ≥ 2. We give some formula (Theorem 1.14) for
mr (Rx ) though it is not so effective as the m2 case.
    The subsequent sections are devoted to the computation of m2 (ρ) for the case
where G = SLn . We obtain the results by applying the results in section 1, together
with the computation of m2 (e  ρ|GF 2 ) for irreducible characters ρe of GLn (Fq2 ).

     1.1. For any finite group Γ and an automorphism F : Γ → Γ , we denote by Γ/∼F
the set of F -twisted conjugacy classes in Γ , where x, y ∈ Γ are F -twisted conjugate
if there exists z ∈ Γ such that y = z −1 xF (z). In the case where F acts trivially on
Γ , the set Γ/∼F coincides with the set of conjugacy classes in Γ , which we denote by
Γ/∼.
     For a connected algebraic group X defined over Fq , and two Frobenius maps F1 , F2
on X such that F1 F2 = F2 F1 , we define a norm map

                              NF1 /F2 : X F1/∼F2 → X F2/∼F1−1

as follows; for x ∈ X F1 , we choose α ∈ X such that x = α−1 F2 (α), and put x′ =
F1 (α)α−1 . Then x′ ∈ X F2 and the correspondence x → x′ induces a bijective map
NF1 /F2 , which we call the norm map from X F1/∼F2 to X F2/∼F1−1 .
    For a finite set Y , we denote by C(Y ) the Q̄l -space of all Q̄l -valued functions on
Y . Then the norm map NF1 /F2 induces a linear isomorphism

                    ShF1 /F2 = NF∗−1
                                  1 /F2
                                        : C(X F1/∼F2 ) → C(X F2/∼F1−1 ),

which is called the Shintani descent from X F1 to X F2 .

    1.2. Let G be a connected algebraic group defined over a finite field Fq with
Frobenius map F . We fix a positive integer r, and consider the group H = G × · · · × G
(r-factors). H is endowed with the natural Frobenius map given by (g1 , . . . , gr ) 7→
(F (g1 ), . . . , F (gr )), which we also denote by F . Let F ′ = F ω : H → H be a twisted
Frobenius map on H, where ω : H → H, (g1 , . . . , gr ) 7→ (gr , g1 , . . . , gr−1 ) is the cyclic
permutation of factors. Since ω r = 1 and F ω = ωF , we have (F ′ )rm = F rm for any
m ≥ 1.

Lemma 1.3. The map GF                → HF            , x → (x, 1, . . . , 1) induces a bijection

                                                                            rm
Proof. Take x = (x1 , . . . , xr ), y = (y1 , . . . , yr ) ∈ H F . If x and y are in the same
class, there exists z = (z1 , . . . , zr ) such that yi = zi−1 xi F (zi−1 ) for i ∈ Z/rZ. Now
                                                                                         rm
assume that x = (x1 , 1, . . . , 1). Then z −1 xF ′ (z) = (y1 , 1, . . . , 1) for z ∈ GF if and
only if z = (z1 , F (z1 ), . . . , F r−1(z1 )). Moreover in this case, y1 = z1−1 x1 F r (z1 ). This
shows that the map f is well-defined, and is injective. It is easy to see that each
                                rm
F ′ -conjugacy class in H F contains a representative of the form (x1 , 1, . . . , 1). Hence
f is surjective.                                                                                 

    1.4. For each x ∈ GF , k ≥ 1, we put Nk (x) = xF (x) · · · F k−1 (x). Then the

map GF → GF , x 7→ Nk (x) induces a map GF / ∼F → GF / ∼F k , which we
also denote by Nk . Let ∆(H) ≃ G be the diagonal subgroup of H. The inclusion

∆(H)F ֒→ H F induces a map d : ∆(H)F /∼F → H F /∼F ′ . Then we have a

where f0 is the bijection induced from the isomorphism G →

with y = (1, N1 (x), N2 (x), . . . , Nr−1 (x)).

       rm
x̂ = GF and take α ∈ G such that x̂ = α−1 F (α). Then NF rm/F (x̂) is represented
4

by x = F rm (α)α−1 . On the other hand, since x̂′ = Nr (x̂) = α−1 F r (α), we see that
NF rm /F r (x̂′ ) is represented by F rm (α)α−1 which coincides with j(x). This shows the
commutativity.

                                                                     rm
for some F r -stable irreducible character χ on GF . Let Vi (1 ≤ i ≤ r) be an irre-
           rm
ducible GF -module for the irreducible character F i−1 (χ). Then there exists a linear
                                                                                    rm
isomorphism Ti : Vi → Vi+1 such that Ti ◦ g = F (g) ◦ Ti for any g ∈ GF with
Vr+1 = V1 and that (Tr Tr−1 · · · T1 )m = 1. Let ψ be as in (1.6.1). Then ψ is afforded by
       rm
the H F -module V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr . Let us define an action of σ ′ on V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr by

                                   σ ′ = ω ◦ (T1 ⊗ T2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Tr ),

where ω is the cyclic permutation of factors given by

                          ω(x1 ⊗ x2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xr ) = xr ⊗ x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xr−1 .
                                                          rm
Then we have σ ′ ◦ h = F ′ (h) ◦ σ ′ for h ∈ H F , and so V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr can be extended
to an He F rm -module. We denote by ψe the corresponding extension of ψ to H      e F rm .
                                                  rm                                  rm
     Let σ = F |GF rm , and we consider GF hσi the semidirect product of GF with
the cyclic group hσi of order rm generated by σ. We define an action of σ r on V1 by
                                                                    rm            rm
σ r = Tr Tr−1 · · · T1 . Then σ r ◦ g = F r (g) ◦ σ r for any g ∈ GF , and the GF -module
V1 can be extended to a GF hσ r i-module Ve1 . We denote by χ
                                   rm
                                                                        e the corresponding
                          rm
extension of χ to GF hσ r i. We show the following lemma.

Lemma 1.7. Let h = (g, 1, . . . , 1) ∈ H F with g ∈ GF . Let χ be an F r -stable
                           rm                                                     rm
irreducible character of GF . Then for ψ = χ ⊗ F (χ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ F r−1 (χ) ∈ Irr H F ,
we have
                                   e ′) = χ

Proof. Let v1 , . . . , vn be a basis of V1 . We define a basis v1 , . . . , vn                            of Vi+1
                 (i+1)          (i)
inductively by vj        = Ti (vj ) for i = 1, 2, . . . r − 1. Then we have

                                       (r)                     (1)        (1)
                                 Tr (vj ) = Tr · · · T1 (vj ) = σ r vj .

It follows that
                          (1)    (2)           (r)               (1)      (2)                (r)
               hσ ′ · vi1 ⊗ vi2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vir = (gσ r vir ) ⊗ vi1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vir−1 ,

and we have
                    e ′ ) = Tr (hσ ′ , V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr ) = Tr (gσ r , V1 ) = χ
                    ψ(hσ                                                     e(gσ r ).

This proves the lemma.                                                                       
                                                                                      rm
     1.8. Let χ be an F r -stable irreducible character of GF , and χ
                                                                    e be its extension to

G hσ i as in the previous lemma. Under the natural bijection G /∼F r ≃ GF σ r/∼
        r
                                                rm              rm
via x ↔ xσ, we have an isomorphism C(GF /∼F r ) ≃ C(GF σ r/∼). Thus χ           e|GF rm σr
                                        rm
defines an element in the space C(GF /∼F r ). Put
                                         (m)
                                       Rχe                    χ|GF rm σr ).
                                               = ShF rm /F r (e

           (m)                                    r
Hence Rχe        is a class function on GF . We have the following formula.
Proposition 1.9. Under the notation as above,
                  rm
                         X                             X (m)
(1.9.1)        |GF |−1        e(Nr (ĝ)σ r ) = |GF |−1
                              χ                         Rχe (g).
                                   ĝ∈GF rm                                      g∈GF

                           rm
Proof. Take ĝ ∈ GF . Write ĝ as ĝ = α−1 F (α) and put g = F rm (α)α−1. Then
g ∈ GF , and we see that χ
                         e(Nr (ĝ)σ r ) = Rχe (g) by (1.5.1). Moreover, it is known that
                                 rm
                    ♯{x ∈ GF          | x−1 ĝF (x) = ĝ} = ♯{y ∈ GF | y −1 gy = g}.

The formula (1.9.1) is immediate from these two facts.                                       
                     (m)
    1.10. Let cr (e
                  χ) be the left hand side of (1.9.1), i.e.,
                                                   rm
                                                                 X
(1.10.1)                        cr(m) (e
                                       χ) = |GF           |−1              e(Nr (ĝ)σ r ).
                                                                           χ
                                                                ĝ∈GF rm

       (m)
Then cr (e χ) is a generalization of the twisted Frobenius-Schur indicator discussed in
                                                                               (1)
Kawanaka and Matsuyama [KM]. In the case where m = 1, we simply write cr (e        χ) as
cr (χ). Note that in this case, the extension does not enter the formula, and we have
                                                      r
                                                                 X
                                      cr (χ) = |GF |−1                   χ(Nr (g)).
                                                                g∈GF r


If r = 2, c2 (χ) coincides with the Frobenius-Schur indicator defined in [KM].
                                                 r
     Let us define, for a class function f of GF ,
                                           Fr
                                                        X
(1.10.2)                mr (f ) = hf, IndG         F −1
                                         GF 1i = |G |      f (x).
                                                                               x∈GF


Then the identity (1.9.1) can be rewritten as
                                                                         (m)
(1.10.3)                                     cr(m) (e
                                                    χ) = mr (Rχe ).

We note that (1.10.3) is a generalization of the formula due to Kawanaka [K2, (1.1)]. In
fact, in the case where m = 1, the Shintani descent ShF r /F r coincides with the inverse

                                            r                                                               (1)
of the twisting operator t∗1 on C(GF /∼) given in [K2], and so we have Rχ = t∗−1
                                                                             1 χ.
Then (1.10.3) implies the following.
Corollary 1.11. Let the notations be as above. Then we have cr (χ) = mr (t∗−1
                                                                          1 χ).

    In the case where r = 2, this formula is nothing but the formula (1.1) in [K2].
    1.12. By Lemma 1.7, χ      e(Nr (ĝ)σ r ) = ψ(hσ e ′ ) with h = (Nr (ĝ), 1, . . . , 1) ∈ H F rm .
                                                           rm
As in 1.4, h is F ′ -conjugate to (ĝ, . . . , ĝ) ∈ ∆(H)F , and so

                                    e ′ ) = ψ((ĝ,
                                    ψ(hσ    e      . . . , ĝ)σ ′ ).
                                                                              rm           rm
On the other hand, under the isomorphism ∆(H)F ≃ GF , V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr is an
     rm
GF -module, and its character χF (χ) · · · F r−1 (χ) is F -stable. Moreover, we have
                                                                rm
σ ′ ◦ g = F (g) ◦ σ ′ on V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr for any g ∈ GF . This implies that the action of σ ′
                             rm
defines a structure of GF hσi-module on V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vr , where σ acts by σ ′ on it. We
denote the character of this module by ψe0 , which is an extension of χF (χ) · · · F r−1 (χ).
Thus, we have
                                     e
                                     ψ((ĝ, . . . , ĝ)σ ′ ) = ψe0 (ĝσ).
Now (1.9.1) can be rewritten as
                                                     rm
                                                                 X
                                                                              ψe0 (ĝσ).

    1.13. Let us define an inner product on C(GF /∼F ) by
                                       rm
                                            X

Here in the left hand side, χ  e′ are regarded as functions on GF

The following statement is immediate from (1.13.1).

(1.13.2) Let ρ be an F -stable character of GF , and ρe its extension to GeF k . Then we

    We have the following theorem.
                                                                      rm

    (i) We have cr (eχ) = mr (Rχe ) = M

                               (m)
                        |mr (Rχe )| ≤ Mrm (χF (χ) · · · F r−1 (χ)).

                                                                           (m)
        Furthermore, if Mrm (χF (χ) · · · F r−1 (χ)) = 1, we have |mr (Rχe )| = 1.
   (ii) Assume that r = 2. Then there exists a 2m-th root of unity ζ such that
                                         (
                               (m)         ζ       if χ = F (χ),
                         m2 (Rχe ) =
                                           0       otherwise,

       where χ is the complex conjugate of the character χ.
                            (m)    frm (ψe0 ) in (i) follows from (1.12.1). The inequality
Proof. The equality mr (Rχe ) = M
in (i) follows from (1.13.2). Assume that r = 2. Then we have
                                                              (
                                                                1     if F (χ) = χ,
        M2m (χF (χ)) = hχF (χ), 1iGF 2m = hF (χ), χiGF 2m =                         .
                                                                0     otherwise.

So the assertion (ii) follows from (1.13.2). This proves the theorem.                    

explicitly. Let χ be an F -stable irreducible character of G         and χ
                                                                         e its extension to
    2m
GF hσ 2 i as in the theorem. Let us assume that F (χ) = χ. We follow the setting
                                               2m
in 1.6. In particular V1 (resp. V2 ) is a GF -module affording χ (resp. F (χ)). Since
                                              F 2m      2m
F (χ) = χ, the subspace W = (V1 ⊗ V2 )G            of GF -invariant vectors in V1 ⊗ V2 is
of dimension 1. The map σ ′ : V1 ⊗ V2 → V1 ⊗ V2 , v1 ⊗ v2 7→ T2 (v2 ) ⊗ T1 (v1 ) preserves
                                                                         (m)
the space W , and the eigenvalue of σ ′ on W coincides with ζ = c2 (e        χ). The map
σ = T2 T1 : V1 → V1 extends the G -module V1 to the G hσ i-module Ve1 affording
  2                                    F 2m                  F 2m    2

the character χ  e.
            F 2m                                                                         2m
     The G -module V2 can be identified with V1 by replacing the action of g ∈ GF
by F (g). Under this identification, we may take T1 = IdV1 and T2 = σ 2 on V1 . Hence
we have σ ′ (v1 ⊗ v2 ) = σ 2 (v2 ) ⊗ v1 . Now the averaging operator V1 ⊗ V2 → W, v 7→
     2m   P
|GF |−1 g∈GF 2m g · v determines a bilinear form B : V1 × V1 → Q̄l (up to scalar)
8

having the following properties.
                                                                         2m
(1.15.1)           B(g · v1 , F (g) · v2 ) = B(v1 , v2 )    for g ∈ GF        , v1 , v2 ∈ V1
                         B(σ 2 (v2 ), v1 ) = ζB(v1 , v2 )    for v1 , v2 ∈ V1 .

Conversely, if there exists such a bilinear from on V1 , this form coincides with B up
                                            (m)
to scalar. Hence ζ determines the value c2 (e    χ).
    The extension χ e of χ is determined by the choice of T1 , T2 such that (T2 T1 )m = IdV1 .
If we replace T1 by a scalar multiple ξT1 for an m-th root of unity ξ, it gives a different
extension of χe′ of χ. By changing χ      e′ , the eigenvalue ζ of σ ′ on W is replaced by
                                     e by χ
ξζ. Summing up the above arguments, we have the following refinement of Theorem
1.14, which is a generalization of Theorem 2.1.3 in [K2].
                                                                                  2m

         where ζ is an 2m-th root of unity.
    (ii) Assume that F (χ) = χ. Let ζ0 be a primitive 2m-th root of unity in Q̄l . Then
                                                              (m)
         there exists a unique extension χ e of χ such that c2 (e  χ) = 1 or ζ0 . Let V1 be

         the G hσ i-module affording χ     e. Then c2 (e   χ) = 1 (resp ζ0 ) if and only if
         there exists a non-zero bilinear form B(·, ·) on V1 satisfying (1.15.1) with ζ = 1
         (resp. ζ = ζ0 ).

    1.17. In the case where G is a connected reductive group with connected center,
Lusztig defined in [L1] almost characters of GF . In the case where G is a special linear
group SLn with F of split type, almost characters are also formulated in [S3]. In
                                                                              χ|GF m σ ), up
either case, the set of almost characters coincides with the set of ShF m /F (e

the F -stable irreducible characters of GF . We denote by Rχ the almost character of
GF corresponding to χ. As a corollary to Theorem 1.14, we have the following result.
Corollary 1.18. Assume that G is either a connected reductive group with connected
                                                                         2

                                               2m
to an F 2 -stable irreducible character χ of GF . Then we have
                                         (
                                          ζ     if F (χ) = χ,

                                          0     otherwise,

where ζ is a certain 2m-th root of unity.

Remark 1.19. In [L3, Prop. 7.2], Lusztig proved a formula concerning the char-
acteristic functions of character sheaves as follows. Let A be an F 2 -stable character
                                                                       2
sheaf of a connected reductive group G. We denote by χA,φA ∈ C(GF /∼) the charac-
                                                                     ∼ A. Then under
teristic function of A with respect to an isomorphism φA : (F 2 )∗ A −
                                                                     →
                                                                                         9

the assumption that q is sufficiently large (and that χA,φA can be written as a lin-
ear combination of irreducible characters with cyclotomic integers coefficients), there
exists a choice of φA such that
                                 (
                                   (−1)dim supp A  if F ∗ (A) ≃ DA,
(1.19.1)           m2 (χA,φA ) =
                                   0               otherwise,

where DA is the Verdier dual of A. Since the proof depends on the asymptotic behavior
of q → ∞, the condition on q is considerably large. In the case where G has a connected
                                                                               2
center, using the description of m2 (χ) for any irreducible character χ of GF in [L3],
(1.18.1) can be verified directly. In [S2], it was shown that almost characters coincide
with the characteristic functions of character sheaves whenever G has a connected
center. A similar result was also shown in [S4] for SLn with F of split type. Hence
the formula (1.18.1) is a counter part of (1.19.1) to almost characters, which works
without any assumption on q. Also, Theorem 1.14 (ii) is regarded as an extension of
(1.19.1) to arbitrary connected algebraic groups.
     1.20. As a special case of the situation discussed in Theorem 1.14 (i), we consider
the case where G = GLn with the standard or non-standard Frobenius map F over
                                    r
Fq . Irreducible characters of GF is described as follows. Let G∗ ≃ GLn be the dual
                                                                                         r
group of G. For each F r -stable semisimple class {s}, choose a representative s ∈ G∗F .
Let T ∗ be a maximally split maximal torus in ZG∗ (s). Let W = NG∗ (T ∗ )/T ∗ be the
Weyl group of G∗ , and put Ws = {w ∈ W | w(s) = s}. Then Ws is the Weyl group
of ZG∗ (s), and F r acts naturally on Ws , which we denote by δ. Let (Irr Ws )δ be the
set of F r -stable irreducible representations of Ws . For each E ∈ (Irr Ws )δ , we fix an
extension E  e of E to the semidirect group Ws hδi, where hδi is the infinite cyclic group
with generator δ. Put
                                           X
                           Rs,Ee = |Ws |−1             e T ∗ (s),
                                               Tr (wδ, E)R  w
                                           w∈Ws


where RTw∗ (s) denotes the Deligne-Lusztig character RTw (θ) under the natural corre-
spondence (s, Tw∗ ) ↔ (θ, Tw ).
    It is known, under a suitable choice of the extension, ±Rs,Ee gives rise to an irre-
                        r                                               r
ducible character of GF , which we denote by ρs,E . Then the set Irr GF of irreducible
                 r
characters of GF is given as
                                r
                                   a
                          Irr GF =    {ρs,E | E ∈ (Irr Ws )δ },
                                     {s}


where {s} runs over F r -stable semisimple conjugacy classes in G∗ .
                                                                           r
    Let (s, T ∗ ) be as above. We choose an F r -stable maximal torus of GF which is
dual to T ∗ , and let B be a Borel subgroup of G containing T . We choose an integer
                                                                                  rm
m > 0 such that F mr leaves B invariant. One can find a linear character θ of T F
                           rm
corresponding to s ∈ T ∗F . Then we have
                                          F rm   
                            EndGF rm IndG F
                                               e ≃ Q̄l [Ws ],
                                            rm θ

where θe is the lift of θ to the linear character of B F . Let us denote by χθ,E the

                                 F rm
irreducible constituent of IndG        e                                                      r
                               B F rm θ corresponding to E ∈ Irr Ws . Then χθ,E is F -

                                                                      χθ,E |GF rm σr ) coincides
with ρs,E up to a scalar multiple. Thus under this setting, Theorem 1.14 (i) can be
rewritten as follows.
Corollary 1.21. Let G = GLn with the standard or non-standard Frobenius map F .
                           r
Then for each ρs,E ∈ Irr GF , we have

                      mr (ρs,E ) ≤ Mrm (χθ,E F (χθ,E ) · · · F r−1 (χθ,E )).

Moreover, if Mrm (χθ,E F (χθ,E ) · · · F r−1 (χθ,E )) = 1, we have mr (ρs,E ) = 1.

         2. Parametrization of irreducible characters of SLn (Fq2 )

    2.1. In the remainder of this paper, we assume that G    e = GLn and G = SLn with
Frobenius maps F with respect to the standard Fq -structures. We assume that p is
large enough so that the results in [S3] can be applied. For example p ≥ n is enough
in our case. Let G  e∗ (resp. G∗ ) be the dual group of G e (resp. G). Then Ge∗ ≃ GLn ,
and G∗ ≃ G e∗ /Ze∗ , where Ze∗ is the center of G
                                                e∗ . The inclusion map G ֒→ G
                                                                            e induces a
natural surjection π : G e → G . As in the case of G,
                          ∗      ∗                     e the set Irr G is partitioned as
                                                                      F 2



                                       2
                                           a         2
                                 Irr GF =      E(GF , {s}),
                                              {s}


where {s} runs over F 2 -stable semisimple classes in G∗ . Take s such that F 2 (s) = s.
Let T ∗ be an F 2 -stable maximal torus of ZG∗ (s) such that T ∗ is contained in an F 2 -
stable Borel subgroup of ZG∗ (s). Let Te∗ be an F 2 -stable maximal torus of G   e∗ such
that π(Te∗ ) = T ∗ . Then W = NGe ∗ (Te∗ )/Te∗ is naturally identified with NG∗ (T ∗ )/T ∗ .
Put
                     Ws = NZG∗ (s) (T ∗ )/T ∗, Ws0 = NZG0 ∗ (s) (T ∗ )/T ∗ .
Then Ws0 is the Weyl group of ZG0 ∗ (s). Now Ws can be decomposed as Ws ≃ Ws0 ⋊ Ωs ,
where Ωs = ZG∗ (s)/ZG0 ∗ (s) is a cyclic group. If we choose ṡ ∈ Te∗ such that π(ṡ) = s,
then Ws0 is naturally identified with Wṡ = {w ∈ W | w(ṡ) = ṡ}.
    F 2 acts naturally on Ws . We denote by δ this action and consider the semidirect
product Ws hδi, where δwδ −1 = F 2 (w). δ stabilizes Ws0 and Ωs .
    2.2. For each E ∈ Irr Ws0 , let Ωs (E) be the stabilizer of E in Ωs . Assume that
the Ωs -orbit of E is δ-stable. Put

                               e s (E) = {u ∈ Ωs | uδ E = E}.
                               Ω

Then one can write Ω   e s (E) = Ωs (E)a for some a ∈ Ωs . Since Ωs (E) is abelian, Ωs (E) is
δ-stable, and Ωs (E) acts on Ω  e s (E) by (z, u) 7→ z −1 uδ(z) for z ∈ Ωs (E) and u ∈ Ω
                                                                                       e s (E).
We denote by Ω   e s (E)δ the set of equivalent classes under this action. It is easy to
see that Ωe s (E)δ can be identified with the set Ωs (E)δ a, where Ωs (E)δ is the largest
                                                                                              11

quotient of Ωs (E) on which δ acts trivially. Let Irr Ws0 be the set of Ωs -orbits in the
set Irr Ws0 . We denote by (Irr Ws0 )δ the set of δ-stable orbits in Irr Ws0 .
    For each pair (s, E) with E ∈ (Irr Ws0 )δ , put

                                                     e s (E)δ ,
                                   Ms,E = Ωδs (E)∧ × Ω

where Ωδs = {u ∈ Ωs , δ(u) = u} and Ωδs (E) is the stabilizer of E in Ωδs , and Ωδs (E)∧
is the set of irreducible characters of Ωδs (E). It is known by [S3] that there exists a
natural bijection
                                   2
                                                a
(2.2.1)                      E(GF , {s}) =              Ms,E
                                                     E∈(Irr Ws0 )δ

                                                                2
We denote by ρη,z the irreducible character of GF corresponding to (η, z) ∈ Ms,E .
                                                                                               2
     The above parametrization satisfies the following properties; The set of G∗F -
                                       2
conjugacy classes in the set {s}F is in bijection with (Ωs )δ . For each x ∈ (Ωs )δ , take a
representative ẋ ∈ Ωs , choose gx ∈ G∗ such that gx−1 F 2 (gx ) = ẋ, and put sx = gx sgx−1 .
Then F 2 (sx ) = sx , and gx T ∗ gx−1 = Tx∗ is a maximally split torus in ZG∗ (sx ). We define
Ws0x in a similar way as Ws0 . Under the isomorphism Ws0 → Ws0x induced by ad gx , the
action of xδ on Ws0 is transferred to the action of F 2 on Ws0x . Hence each xδ-stable
irreducible character E ′ of Ws0 determines the F 2 -stable irreducible character E ′′ of
Ws0x . Take an F 2 -stable element ṡx such that π(ṡx ) = sx . We consider the irreducible
character ρṡx ,E ′′ of GF 2 as in 1.19, which we denote by ρṡx ,E ′ , by abuse of the notation.
     It is known by [S3, (4.4.2)] that there exists a natural bijection
                                a                          a
(2.2.2)                f:                   e s (E)δ ≃
                                            Ω                       (Irr Ws0 )ẋδ /Ωδs ,
                            E∈(Irr Ws0 )δ                x∈(Ωs )δ


where in the right hand side, (Irr Ws0 )ẋδ /Ωδs means the set of Ωδs -orbit of ẋδ-stable
irreducible characters of Ws0 . The bijection is described as follows. Take E in a δ-
stable Ωs -orbit in Irr Ws0 . For each ẏ ∈ Ω   e s (E), there exists ẋ ∈ Ωs and z ∈ Ωs such
that ẏ = z ẋδ(z). Then Ex = E ∈ (Irr Ws0 )ẋδ . The correspondence (E, y) 7→ (x, Ex )
           −1                     z

gives rise to the required bijection f .
    Under the above setting, we have
                                                     X
(2.2.3)                          ρṡx ,Ex |GF 2 =          ρη,y .
                                                      η∈Ωδs (E)∧


    Let Tsx ,Ex be the set of irreducible characters occurring in the restriction of ρṡx ,Ex
      2
to GF . We also denote by T s,E the set of ρη,y for (η, y) ∈ Ms,E . Then (2.2.2) implies
that
                                             a
                                    T s,E =      Tsx ,Ex ,
                                                   (x,Ex )

                                                                        e s (E)δ under
where (x, Ex ) runs over all the pairs corresponding to (y, E) with y ∈ Ω
the map f .
12

Remark 2.3. In [S3, 4.5], the parameter set Ms,E is defined as Ωδs (E)∧ × Ωs (E)δ .
Since Ωe s (E)δ = Ωs (E)δ a, this set is in bijection with Ms,E in this paper. However,
the bijection depends on the choice of a ∈ Ωs , and the definition of Ms,E in this paper
is more convenient for later applications.
     2.4. We describe the decomposition of ρṡx ,Ex |GF 2 in (2.2.3) more precisely. It is
known by [L2] that Tsx ,Ex is in bijective correspondence with Ωδs (E)∧ . This bijection
is given as follows. The abelian group G          eF 2 /GF 2 acts transitively on Tsx ,Ex by the
conjugation action. Also its dual group (G        eF 2 /GF 2 )∧ acts on Irr G  eF 2 by (θ, ρe) 7→ θ ⊗ ρe
for a linear character θ ∈ (G      eF 2 /GF 2 )∧ and ρe ∈ Irr G  e F 2 . Then for ρ0 ∈ Tsx ,Ex , the
stabilizer of ρ0 in G  eF 2 /GF 2 and the stabilizer of ρṡx ,Ex in (G   eF 2 /GF 2 )∧ are orthogonal
to each other under the natural duality pairing G        eF 2 /GF 2 × (G eF 2 /GF 2 )∧ → Q̄l (cf. [L2,
9]). Let I(ρṡx ,Ex ) be the stabilizer of ρṡx ,Ex in (GeF 2 /GF 2 )∧ . Then, under the choice of
ρ0 , the set Tsx ,Ex is in natural bijection with I(ρṡx ,Ex )∧ .
     We show that I(ρṡx ,Ex ) is isomorphic to Ωδs (E). First note that there exists a
natural isomorphism
                             2
(2.4.1)                             e F 2 /GF 2 , Q̄∗ ) = (G
                         Ze∗F ≃ Hom(G                      eF 2 /GF 2 )∧ .
                                                    l


If z is an element in Ze∗F corresponding to θ ∈ (G          e F 2 /GF 2 )∧ under the above isomor-
                           2


phism, then θ maps E(G   e F 2 , {ṡx }) onto E(G
                                                e F 2 , {z ṡx }). Put
                         2            2
                   Zes∗F
                       x
                           = {z ∈ Ze∗F | z ṡx is conjugate to ṡx under G
                                                                         e∗ },

which does not depend on the choice of ṡx for sx . Then, under the identification in
(2.4.1), I(ρṡx ,Ex ) is regarded as a subgroup of Zes∗F
                                                         2
                                                       x
                                                           . Here we have a natural isomor-
phism
                                 ad gx        F2          F2
                                                             −−−→ Zes∗F
                                                                        2
(2.4.2)          ωsx : Ωδs = Ωxδ                 0
                              s −−−→ ZG∗ (sx ) /ZG∗ (sx )             x


                                                 2
defined as follows. For each z ∈ ZG∗ (s)xF , choose ż ∈ G     e∗xF 2 such that π(ż) = z. Then
  (ṡ ż ṡż −1 ) ∈ Zes∗F
gx −1                      2
                         x
                             , and this induces the required isomorphism since π(ZGe ∗ (ṡx )) =
  0
ZG∗ (sx ). Now under the identification in (2.4.1), (2.4.2), we may see that I(ρṡx ,Ex ) is
a subgroup of Ωδs , and in fact, I(ρṡx ,Ex ) coincides with the stabilizer of Ex in Ωδs . Thus
we have I(ρṡx ,Ex ) = Ωδs (Ex ) = Ωδs (E).
    2.5. The bijection between Tsx ,Ex and Ωδs (E)∧ given in 2.4 depends on the choice
of ρ0 ∈ Tsx ,Ex . We have to choose a specific ρ0 for each Tsx ,Ex . This problem is
reduced to a certain special case, and is solved by the aide of generalized Gelfand-
Graev characters.
    Let g be the Lie algebra of G with Frobenius map F . We have a bijection log :
Guni → gnil by v 7→ v − 1, where Guni (resp. gnil ) is the unipotent variety of G (resp.
nilpotent variety of g). Let N be a nilpotent
                                     L        element in gF . By Dynkin-Kostant
                                                                         L        theory,
there exists a natural grading g = i∈Z gi associated to N. Let ui = j≥i gj . Then
one can find an F -stable parabolic subgroup P = LU1 associated to N, where L is an
F -stable Levi subgroup of P with Lie L = g0 , and U1 is the unipotent radical of P with
                                                                                          13

Lie U1 = u1 . Moreover we have N ∈ g2 . Let k be an algebraic closure of Fq . According
to Kawanaka [K1], there exists an F -stable subspace u (u1.5 in the notation of [S3]) of
u1 containing u2 and an F -equivariant linear map λ : u → k satisfying the following.
There exists an F -stable connected unipotent subgroup U of U1 such that log(U) = u
and that the map λ ◦ log : U → k turns out to be an F -stable homomorphism of U.
                                       2
We define a linear character ΛN of U F by ΛN = ψ2 ◦ λ ◦ log, where ψ2 : Fq2 → Q̄∗l is
the additive character defined by ψ2 = ψ ◦ Tr Fq2 /Fq for a non-trivial additive character
                                                                     2
ψ : Fq → Q̄∗l . The generalized Gelfand-Graev character ΓN of GF associated to N is
defined as
                                              F2
                                   ΓN = IndGUF2 N
                                                 Λ .
                                             2
The character ΓN depends only on the GF -conjugacy class of N.
    We now consider the following special setting for the set Ms,E determined by the
pair (s, E).
(2.5.1) Ws0 is isomorphic to Sb × · · · × Sb (t-times) with b = n/t, and Ωs ≃ hw0 i, where
w0 is an element of order t in Ws permuting the factors of Ws0 transitively. Moreover,
E ∈ Irr Ws0 is of the form

                     E = E1 ⊠ E1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ E1     with E1 ∈ Irr Sb .

Then E is Ωs -stable, and we have Ωs = Ωs (E). Now it is known that there exists
a unique irreducible character ρ0 such that ρ0 occurs both in ΓN and in ρṡx ,E |GF 2 .
By using this ρ0 , one obtains a bijection Tsx ,Ex ↔ Ωδs (E)∧ as in 2.4. This is the
parametrization given in (2.2.3), where if (x, Ex ) corresponds to (E, y) by (2.2.2),
then ρη,y corresponds to η ∈ Ωδs (E)∧ .
     By the arguments in [S3, 4.5], the parametrization of Tsx ,Ex in the general case
is reduced to the case given in (2.5.1). Accordingly, ρ0 is determined for each Tsx ,Ex .
However, note that this parametrization still depends on the choice of a nilpotent
element N in g. In what follows, we assume that
(2.5.2) Each nilpotent element N ∈ gF is taken to be a Jordan normal form.
     2.6 In order to apply the results in section 1, we need to know the condition
                                                         2
when F (ρ) = ρ for an irreducible character ρ of GF . We return to the setting in 2.2,
and further assume that F (s) = s−1 . Then F acts on Ws , preserving Ws0 and Ωs .
We denote this action by γ, so that γ 2 = δ. Note that if ρ′ belongs to Ms,E , then ρ′
belongs to Ms−1 ,E since E ∈ Irr Ws0 is self dual. Also F (ρ′ ) belongs to MF (s),F (E) .
Hence if ρ as above belongs to Ms,E , the Ωs -orbit of E turns out to be F -stable. It
                      e s (E) invariant, and induces an action on Ω
follows that γ leaves Ω                                              e s (E)δ . We denote by
e s (E) the set of γ-fixed points in Ω
Ω       γ                             e s (E)δ . γ acts also on the set Ωδ (E)∧ . We denote
        δ                                                                 s
          ∧                    δ   ∧
by Ωs (E)−γ the set of η ∈ Ωs (E) such that γ(η) = η. We put, for E ∈ (Irr Ws0 )γ ,
      δ


                                  0
                                                   e s (E)γ .
                               Ms,E = Ωδs (E)∧−γ × Ω      δ

We have the following proposition.
                                                                2
Proposition 2.7. Let ρη,y be the irreducible character of GF corresponding to (η, y) ∈
Ms,E . Assume that F (s) = s−1 .
14

      (i) If the Ωs -orbit of E is not F -stable, then F (ρη,y ) 6= ρη,y .
     (ii) Assume that the Ωs -orbit of E is F -stable. Then F (ρη,y ) = ρη,y if and only if
                      0
          (η, y) ∈ Ms,E .
     The proposition will be proved in 2.11 after some preliminaries. First we note that
Lemma 2.8. For each N, we have F (ΓN ) = ΓN , and ΓN = ΓN .
                                                                                                 2
Proof. The fact that F (ΓN ) = ΓN can be checked directly for any N ∈ gF since U F
is F -stable and ΛN is also F -stable. On the other hand, it follows from the definition
that we have ΓN = Γ−N . So, in order to show the lemma, it is enough to see that N is
                            2
conjugate to −N under GF . Since N is given by a Jordan normal form, this is reduced
to the case where N is regular nilpotent. Assume that N is a regular nilpotent element
given in the Jordan normal form. There exists g = diag(a, −a, . . . , (−1)n−1 a) ∈ G   e
                −1                      F2                                k n
such that gNg = −N. Then g ∈ G if and only if a ∈ Fq2 and (−1) a = 1 with
k = [n/2]. We can set a = 1 if k is even, and set a = −1 if k is odd and n is odd. So,
assume that n is even and k is odd, i.e., n = 2k. In this case, we may take a ∈ Fq2
                                                      2
such that a2 = −1. Thus we can always find g ∈ GF , and the lemma follows.             
     As a corollary, we have
Corollary 2.9. Let ρṡx ,Ex ∈ Irr G         eF 2 and ρ0 ∈ Irr GF 2 be as in 2.5. Assume that
F (ρṡx ,Ex )|GF 2 = ρṡx ,Ex |GF 2 . Then we have F (ρ0 ) = ρ0 .
                                             2
Proof. The parametrization of Irr GF in terms of the set Ms,E is reduced to the
special case where Ms,E is given by (2.5.1) through the steps (b) and (c) in [S3, 4.5].
Since the steps (b) and (c) are compatible with the F action and with taking duals,
the assertion is reduced to the case of (2.5.1). In this case, we have F (ΓN ) = ΓN
by Lemma 2.8. Note that the F -action and taking duals preserve the inner product.
Since ρ0 is the unique irreducible character such that

                              hΓN , ρ0 iGF 2 = hρsx ,Ex , ρ0 iGF 2 = 1,

the corollary follows.                                                                          
Lemma 2.10. Assume that the set Ms,E satisfies the assumption of Proposition 2.7
(ii). Take y ∈ Ω   e s (E)δ and assume that (E, y) ↔ (x, Ex ) under the map in (2.2.2).
                                                            e s (E)γ .
Then F (ρṡx ,Ex )|GF 2 = ρṡx ,Ex |GF 2 if and only if y ∈ Ω      δ

Proof. We may choose ẏ ∈ ZG∗ (s) as a representative of x ∈ (Ωs )δ , so we may assume
that Ex = E. Then it is known by [S3, (4.5.1)] that Tsx ,Ex = Tsy ,E corresponds
to the set Ωδs (E)∧ × {y} under the correspondence Ts,E ↔ Ms,E . It is easy to see,
for any pair (s1 , E1 ), that F (ρṡ1 ,E1 ) = ρF (ṡ1 ),F (E1 ) , where F (E1 ) is the character of
WF (s1 ) corresponding to E1 under the isomorphism Ws1 ≃ WF (s1 ) . On the other
hand, we have ρṡ1 ,E1 = ρṡ−1     1 ,E1
                                         since Ws1 = Ws−11
                                                              and E1 is self dual. It follows that
F (ρṡy ,E ) = ρF (ṡ−1
                     y ),F (E)
                               . By our assumption, F (s ) = s. Hence we have F (s−1
                                                          −1                                    ∗
                                                                                        y ) ∈ Tγ(y)
and F (E) ∈ (Irr Ws0 )γ(y)δ . This implies that F (Tsy ,E ) = Tsγ(y) ,F (E) = Tsγ(y) ,u E for some
u ∈ Ωs since the Ωs -orbit of E is F -stable. Since Tsγ(y) ,u E = Tsy ,E if and only if γ(y) = y
on Ωe s (E)δ , the lemma is proved.                                                               
                                                                                                    15

     2.11. We shall prove Proposition 2.7. The assertion (i) follows from 2.6. We show
(ii). Take (η, y) ∈ Ms,E . If γ(y) 6= y, then F (ρη,y ) 6= ρη,y by Lemma 2.10. So, assume
that y ∈ Ω   e s (E)γ . Let ρṡx ,Ex be the character of G eF 2 containing ρη,y . Again by Lemma
                    δ
                                                       2
2.10, we have F (ρṡx ,Ex ) = ρṡx ,Ex . Let ρ0 ∈ GF be as in 2.5. Then by Corollary 2.9, we
have F (ρ0 ) = ρ0 . If we write ρη,y = g ρ0 with g ∈ G       eF 2 , we have F (ρη,y ) = F (g) ρ0 . Now
the action of F induces an action on (G       eF 2 /GF 2 )∧ which is compatible with the natural
pairing G   eF 2 /GF 2 × (GeF 2 /GF 2 )∧ → Q̄∗ . Then F stabilizes the subgroup I(ρṡx ,Ex ).
                                              l
     The arguments in 2.4 shows that the condition F (ρη,y ) = ρη,y is described by
investigating the action of F on I(ρṡx ,Ex ). We follow the notation in 2.4. I(ρṡx ,Ex ) is
regarded as a subgroup of Ze∗F . If we denote by ω          esx the map Ωδs → Ze∗F obtained as
                                       2                                                2

I(ρṡx ,Ex ). We note the following.
(2.11.1) Assume that x ∈ (Ωs )δ is γ-stable. Then the following diagram commutes.

where −γ : Ωδs → Ωδs is the map defined by z 7→ γ(z)−1 .
    We show (2.11.1). Take z ∈ Ωδs . Since F (s) = s−1 , we have

                    ωsx (z)) = F (gx (ṡ−1 ż ṡż −1 )) = F (gx ) (ṡF (ż)ṡ−1 F (ż)−1 ).
                  γ(e

                                        esx coincides with ω
On the other hand, since x is γ-stable, ω                  esγ(x) , and we have

             esx (−γ(z)) = F (gx ) (ṡ−1 F (ż)−1 ṡF (ż)) = F (gx ) (ṡF (ż)ṡ−1 F (ż)−1 ).
             ω

since ṡ−1 F (ż)−1 ṡF (ż) is in the center Ze∗ of G
                                                     e∗ . Hence (2.11.1) holds.
     Now (2.11.1) shows that the F -action on I(ρṡx ,Ex ) is transferred to the −γ action on
Ωδs (E). Hence under the parametrization Tsx ,Ex ↔ Ωδs (E) × {y} given by ρη,y ↔ (η, y),
we see that F (ρη,y ) = ρη,y if and only if η is −γ stable, i.e., η ∈ Ωδs (E)∧−γ . This proves
the proposition.

                           3. Almost characters of SLn (Fq2 )
                                                                                               2m
     3.1. We shall parametrize F 2 -stable irreducible characters of GF for a suf-
ficiently divisible integer m. Let s be an F 2 -stable semisimple element in G∗ . We
assume that m is large enough so that F 2m acts trivially on Ws0 and Ωs . We denote by
    (m)                                                   2m
Ms,E the set parametrizing irreducible characters of GF corresponding to Ms,E in
                                        (m)
the previous section. Hence, Ms,E = Ωs (E)∧ × Ωs (E). Since the class s is F 2 -stable,
one can define a map δ = F 2 : Ws → Ws as before. If the Ωs -orbit of E is F 2 -stable,
then δ stabilizes Ωs (E). For a pair (s, E) such that E ∈ (Irr Ws0 )δ , we define a subset
16

             (m)
Ms,E of Ms,E by
                                Ms,E = Ωs (E)∧δ × Ωs (E)δ ,
where Ωs (E)∧δ is the set of δ-stable irreducible characters in Ωs (E)∧ . We denote by
     2m         2                                                         2m
E(GF , {s})F the subset of F 2 -stable irreducible characters in E(GF , {s}). Then
                                                                             2m
by [S3, (4.6.1)] it is known that under the parametrization in (2.2.1) for GF , we have
                                  2m      2
                                                 a
                            E(GF , {s})F =             Ms,E .
                                                     E∈(Irr Ws )δ

                   (m)                                                  2m
We denote by ρη,z the F 2 -stable irreducible character of GF corresponding to (η, z) ∈
Ms,E .
   In the case where F (s) = s−1 , one can define a map γ = F : Ws → Ws preserving
Ωs and Ws0 , and such that δ = γ 2 as before. We denote by Ωs (E)γ the γ-fixed point
subgroup of Ωs (E), and by Ωs (E)∧−γ the set of η ∈ Ωs (E)∧ such that γ(η) = η. Then
we define a subset M0s,E of Ms,E by

                                 M0s,E = Ωs (E)∧−γ × Ωs (E)γ .

     The following proposition can be proved in a similar way as in Proposition 2.7.
                          (m)                                                2m
Proposition 3.2. Let ρx be an F 2 -stable irreducible character of GF             corresponding
to x ∈ Ms,E . Assume that F (s) = s−1 .
                                                                (m)
      (i) If the Ωs -orbit of E is not F -stable, then F (ρx ) 6= ρx(m) .
                                                                   (m)
     (ii) Assume that the Ωs -orbit of E is F -stable. Then F (ρx ) = ρx(m) if and only if
          x ∈ M0s,E .
                                                                       2
   3.3. Following [S3, 4.6], we define almost characters of GF . For a given Ω       e s (E)δ ,
we choose a = aE ∈ Ωs and write it as Ω       e s (E)δ = Ωs (E)δ aE . For x = (η, z) ∈ Ms,E
and y = (η ′ , z ′ a) ∈ Ms,E , we define a pairing {x, y} ∈ Q̄∗l by

                                {x, y} = |Ωs (E)δ |−1 η(z ′ )η ′ (z).
                                                2
Then we define a class function Rx of GF by
                                       X
(3.3.1)                         Rx =      {x, y}ρy .
                                            y∈Ms,E

                                            2
Rx are called almost characters of GF . Note that the definition of the pairing { , }
depends on the choice of aE ∈ Ω e s (E)δ . If aE is replaced by a′ = b−1 aE with b ∈ Ωs (E)δ ,
then Rx is replaced by η(b)Rx . Hence the almost character Rx is determined uniquely
up to a root of unity multiple.
    It is easy to see that (3.3.1) can be converted to the form
                                            X
(3.3.2)                             ρy =            {x, y}−1Rx .
                                           x∈Ms,E
                                                                                                   17

    The following result describes the Shintani descent of irreducible characters of
 F 2m                                           2m
G . Here we write the restriction of F 2 on GF as δ instead of σ 2 , in connection
with the previous section.
                                               (m)
Theorem 3.4 ([S3, Theorem 4.7]). Let ρx be an F 2 -stable irreducible character of
  2m                                                     (m)      2m
GF corresponding to x ∈ Ms,E , and choose an extension ρex to GF hδi. Then

                                          ρx(m) |GF 2m δ ) = µx Rx ,
                             ShF 2m /F 2 (e
                                                                  (m)
where µx is a root of unity depending on the extension ρex                 and on the choice of aE .
   Combining Theorem 3.4 with Proposition 3.2, we have the following refinement of
Corollary 1.18.
Corollary 3.5. Let Ms,E be such that F (s) = s−1 and that the Ωs -orbit of E is
F -stable. Then                   (
                                   ζx     if x ∈ M0s,E ,
                       m2 (Rx ) =
                                   0      otherwise,
where ζx is a certain root of unity.
    The following result describes the action of twisting operators on almost characters.
In the special case where F 2 acts trivially on the center, this was proved by Bonnafé [B,
Théorème 5.5.4]. We note that this result is also derived from the property of character
sheaves, by making use of Lusztig’s conjecture for SLn , which will be discussed in [S4].
Theorem 3.6. For any x = (η, z) ∈ Ms,E , we have

                                    t∗1 (Rx ) = η(z)−1 Rx .

   The theorem will be proved in 3.15 after some preliminaries. First we recall some
general properties of twisting operators.
Lemma 3.7. Let Γ be a connected algebraic group defined over Fq with Frobenius map
F , and H a connected F -stable subgroup of Γ . Then the twisting operator t∗1 commutes
                        F
with the induction IndΓH F .
                                                                                     F
Proof. It is clear that t∗1 commutes with the restriction functor ResΓH F . Moreover t∗1
is an isometry with respect to the inner product on H F and Γ F . The lemma follows
from these two facts.                                                                

    3.8 Let Γ be as in the lemma. For each integer m > 0, we consider the group
Γ , and its semidirect product ΓeF = Γ F hσi, where σ is the restriction of F on

in the following way. We define a map τ1 : Γ F σ/∼→ Γ F σ/∼ by τ1 (xσ) = (xσ)1−m ,
and define τ1∗ by its transpose. It is shown in [S1, Lemma 4.2] that, under the con-
dition that m is sufficiently divisible, τ1∗ is an isomorphism and satisfies the following

We have the following result.
Theorem 3.9 ([S1, Theorem 4.7]). Let ρe be an extension of an F -stable irreducible
character of Γ F to ΓeF . Then for an appropriate choice of (sufficiently divisible) m,
                 m       m


there exists a root of unity λ such that

                                 τ1∗ (e               ρ|Γ F m σ ).
                                      ρ|Γ F m σ ) = λ(e

    The following related result seems to be worth mentioning though it is not used
later. In [S1], under some condition on p, the notion of almost characters was estab-
lished for any connected algebraic group Γ . Then in view of (3.8.1) together with
Theorem 3.9, we have
Corollary 3.10. For each almost character Rx of Γ F , there exists a root of unity λx
such that
                                t∗1 (Rx ) = λx Rx .
    The following result was proved by Digne and Michel, which holds for any con-
nected reductive groups.
Proposition 3.11 ([DM]). Let H be an F -stable Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup
                                                                  Γ
of a connected reductive group Γ . Then the Lusztig induction RH    : C(H F/ ∼) →
    F                                        ∗
C(Γ /∼) commutes with the twisting operator t1 .

    3.12. We now return to our original setting, and consider G = SLn . The modified
generalized Gelfand-Graev characters were introduced by Kawanaka (see [K1]), which
is a refinement of generalized Gelfand-Graev characters. The modified generalized
Gelfand-Graev characters are used in [S3] to parametrize irreducible characters of
SLn . Here we discuss the action of twisting operators on the modified generalized
Gelfand-Graev characters. We follow the notation in 2.5 (but replacing F 2 by F ).
    By [S3, 2.6], we may choose u so that u is L-stable. Let Aλ = ZL (λ)/ZL0 (λ). Then
by [S3, 2.7], we have
                           Aλ ≃ AG (N) = ZG (N)/ZG0 (N).
In particular, Aλ is an abelian group. F acts naturally on Aλ , and we consider the
quotient group (Aλ )F of Aλ . Put

                                  M = (Aλ )F × (AFλ )∧ .

For each pair (c, ξ) ∈ M one can define a modified generalized Gelfand-Graev character
Γc,ξ as follows. For c ∈ Aλ , we choose a representative ċ ∈ ZL (λ). Then we find αc ∈ L
such that αc−1 F (αc ) = ċ. We define a linear map λc : u → k by λc = λ ◦ Ad αc−1 , and
define a linear character Λc = ψ ◦ λc ◦ log on U F . Since ZL (λc )F = ZL (Λc )F , the linear
                                                                                              19

character Λc can be extended to a linear character on ZL (λc )F U F trivial on ZL0 (λc )F ,
which we denote also by Λc . On the other hand, since Aλ is abelian, we can define a
linear character ξ ♮ of ZL (λc )F trivial on ZL0 (λc )F by

                 ξ ♮ : ZL (λc )F → (ZL (λc )/ZL0 (λc ))F ≃ AċF  F     ∗
                                                            λ = Aλ → Q̄l ,

where the last step is given by ξ : AFλ → Q̄∗l . We denote by the same symbol ξ ♮ the lift
of ξ ♮ to ZL (λc )F U F under the homomorphism ZL (λc )F U F → ZL (λc )F . Under these
setting we define Γc,ξ by
                                               F
                                 Γc,ξ = IndG               ♮
                                           ZL (λc )F U F (ξ ⊗ Λc ).



     3.13. We choose m large enough so that F m acts trivially on Aλ . Replacing F by
                                                                (m)       m
F m , we have a modified generalized Gelfand-Graev character Γ(c,ξ) on GF . Now the
parameter set M is replaced by Aλ ×(Aλ )∧ . We denote by M the subset of Aλ ×(Aλ )∧
defined by
                                        M = AFλ × (Aλ )∧F ,
where (Aλ )∧F is the set of F -stable irreducible characters of Aλ . Following [S3, 1.8],
we construct, for each (c, ξ) ∈ M, an F -stable modified generalized Gelfand-Graev
             (m)                            m
character Γc,ξ , and its extension to GF hσi, where σ = F |GF m . For c ∈ AFλ , we
                                                                   (m)       m
choose ċ ∈ LF . We construct the linear character Λc of U F as in 3.12, i.e., we
choose βc ∈ L such that βc−1 F m (βc ) = ċ, and define λc by λc = λ ◦ Ad βc−1 , and put
  (m)                                                                     m          (m)
Λc = ψm ◦ λc ◦ log, where ψm = ψ ◦ Tr Fqm /Fq . Put ĉ = βc F (βc−1 ) ∈ LF . Then Λc
turns out to be ĉF -stable.
    On the other hand, it can be checked that ĉF acts on ZL (λc ) commuting with F m ,
and that under the isomorphism
                                    m              m             m           m
               ad βc−1 : ZL (λc )F /ZL0 (λc )F ≃ ZL (λ)ċF /ZL0 (λ)ċF           ≃ Aλ ,
                                m
the action of ĉF on ZL (λc )F is transferred to the action of F on Aλ . Hence if we take
                                                                          m
ξ ∈ (Aλ )∧F , it produces an ĉF -stable linear character ξ ♮ on ZL (λc )F . It follows that
       (m)                                                        (m)
ξ ♮ ⊗ Λc is ĉF -stable for (c, ξ) ∈ M, and we conclude that Γc,ξ is F -stable.
                           m                                         m       (m)    m
   Put ĉ0 = (ĉσ)m ∈ LF . We note that ĉ0 ∈ ZL (λc )F = ZL (Λc )F . In fact, since
 (m)
Λc is ĉF -stable, it is stable by (ĉσ)m = ĉ0 . We also note that
                                                                         m

                                   c0 βc ≡ ċ−1        (mod ZL0 (λ)ċF )

since (ĉσ)m = βc F m (βc−1) and ċ = βc−1 F m (βc ). In particular, we have

(3.13.1)                                 ξ ♮ (ĉ0 ) = ξ(c−1 ).
                     m                             m                                      m
Put Mc = ZL (λc )F and Mc0 = ZL0 (λc )F . We consider a subgroup Mc U F hĉσi of
   m                        m
GF hσi generated by Mc U F and ĉσ. Since ξ ♮ ∈ Mc∧ is ĉF -stable, and (ĉσ)m = ĉ0 ∈
Mc , ξ ♮ may be extended to a linear character ξe♮ of Mc hĉσi in m distinct way. The
20

extension ξe♮ is determined by the value ξe♮ (ĉσ) = µc,ξ , where µc,ξ is any m-th root of
ξ ♮ (ĉ0 ).
       We fix an extension ξe♮ of ξ ♮ to Mc hĉσi. Since Mc U F hĉσi is the semidirect product
                                                                m


of Mc hĉσi with U F , ξe♮ may be regarded as a character of Mc U F hĉσi. On the other
                      m                                                    m

                 (m)
hand, since Λec is ĉσ-stable, it can be extended to a linear character on Mc U F hĉσi
                                                                                          m

         (m)                                                   (m)
by Λec (ĉσ) = 1. Thus we have a character ξe♮ ⊗ Λec of Mc U F hĉσi which is an
                                                                             m

                      (m)              m
extension of ξ ♮ ⊗ Λc on Mc U F . We put
                                                m
                                        GF hσi
                             Γec,ξ = IndMc U F m hĉσi (ξe♮ ⊗ Λec(m) ).
                               (m)



           (m)                                       (m)                             (m)
Then Γec,ξ gives rise to an extension of Γc,ξ to GF hσi. Note that µ−1  e
                                                                   m
                                                                    c,ξ Γc,ξ |GF σ
                                                                                m

depends only on the choice of (c, ξ).
   Now we have the following result.

Proposition 3.14. Let the notations be as above. We have
                                    (m)                    (m)
                             τ1∗ (Γec,ξ |GF m σ ) = ξ(c)(Γec,ξ |GF m σ )

for an appropriate choice of (sufficiently divisible) m.

Proof. The following proof is an analogy of the argument in [S1, Corollary 5.10]. Put
H = LU. Then H is an F -stable connected subgroup of G. For each (c, ξ) ∈ M, we
denote by θ the linear character ξ ♮ ⊗ Λc of Mc U F , and by θe its extension ξe♮ ⊗ Λec
                                        (m)        m                                  (m)
         m
of Mc U F hb
           cσi. We put H  e F m = H F m hσi, V = Mc U F m , and Ve = Mc U F m hĉσi. We
consider the induced characters
                                           Fm                      eFm
                            ρc,ξ = IndH         θ,   ρec,ξ = IndH        e
                                                                         θ.
                                      V                         Ve

                                          m
                                                                                  e F m.
Then ρc,ξ is an F -stable character of H F , and ρec,ξ is an extension of ρc,ξ to H
Moreover, ρc,ξ is irreducible by [S3, Lemma 1.7]. Note that
                                                       m
                              (m)              GF σ
                            Γec,ξ |GF m σ = IndH        ρc,ξ |H F m σ ).
                                                 F m σ (e



In order to prove the proposition, we have only to show the following formula since τ1∗
                                     m
                                  GF σ
commutes with the induction IndH    F m σ by Lemma 3.7 and (3.8.1).



(3.14.1)                      τ1∗ (e
                                   ρc,ξ |H F m σ ) = ξ(c)(e
                                                          ρc,ξ |H F m σ ).

We show (3.14.1). We choose m so that m is a multiple of some fixed integer A, where
A is divisible by |Aλ |p, and that m − 1 is prime to the order of H e F m . The existence
of such m is shown in [S1, Lemma 4.8]. Then the map f : H      eFm → H    e F m , g 7→ g 1−m
                                                            m
is a bijection, and τ1 is obtained by restricting f to H F σ. Since f stabilizes the
conjugacy classes, it induces an isomorphism f ∗ : C(He F m/∼) → C(H  e F m/∼). The map
                            e
f ∗ stabilizes the space C(V/∼),  and we denote by fVe∗ the restriction of f ∗ on Ve . We
note that
                                                                                           21

               e is a linear character of Ve such that f ∗ (θ)|
(3.14.2) fVe∗ (θ)                                           e V = θ.
                                                        Ve


    In fact, since f induces a homomorphism on H   e F m modulo the commutator sub-
group, fVe∗ maps linear characters to linear characters. We show that the restriction
        e on V coincides with θ. Since λ ◦ log : U → k is a homomorphism of al-
of f ∗ (θ)
    Ve
gebraic groups and m is divisble by p, λ(g m ) = 0 for g ∈ U. This implies that
   (m)                (m)                m
Λc (g 1−m ) = Λc (g) for g ∈ U F . On the other hand, since m is divisible by |Aλ |,
                                                                                           m
ξ ♮ (g 1−m ) = ξ ♮ (g) for g ∈ Mc . It follows that θ(g 1−m ) = θ(g) for any g ∈ V = Mc U F ,
and the claim follows.
       Now it is easy to see that f ∗ commutes with the induction
                                 eFm
                             IndH          e
                                       : C(V/∼)     e F m/∼).
                                                → C(H
                                Ve


Thus f ∗ (e                                      e F m . Now the extensions of θ to θe is
          ρc,ξ ) is also an extension of ρc,ξ to H
                                e
characterized by the value θ(ĉσ),  and it determines the extension ρec,ξ . Since f (ĉσ) =
      1−m           −1
(ĉσ)     = ĉσ · ĉ0 , we see that

                       fVe∗ (ξe♮ ⊗ Λec(m) )(ĉσ) = ξ ♮ (ĉ−1    e♮ e(m)

                                                 = ξ(c) · ξe♮ ⊗ Λe(m) (ĉσ)

by (3.13.1). This proves (3.14.1), and so the proposition follows.                         


     3.15. We are in a position to prove Theorem 3.6. We apply the previous results
to our situation by replacing F by F 2 . By [S3, 4.5], the parametrization of irreducible
characters, ρη′ ,z ′ ↔ (η ′ , z ′ ) ∈ Ms,E are divided into three steps. Accordingly, the
parametrization of almost characters Rη,z ↔ (η, z) ∈ Ms,E are divided similarly. The
cases (b) and (c) in [loc. cit.] are reduced to the case (a) via Harish-Chadra induction
and Lusztig induction. Since the twisting operator commutes with Lusztig induction
by Proposition 3.11, the proof of Theorem 3.6 is reduced to the case (a), i.e., the case
where (s, E) satisfies the condition (2.5.1).
     So, assume that (s, E) is as above. In this case, irreducible characters belonging
to Ms,E and almost characters belonging to Ms,E are characterized by modified gen-
eralized Gelfand-Graev characters as follows. Let ρṡ,E be an irreducible character of
GeF 2 for some ṡ ∈ Ge∗ such that π(ṡ) = s, and N be a nilpotent element such that the
nilpotent orbit ON containing N coincides with the orbit O associated to ρṡ,E (see
e.g., [S3, 2.9]) Let Aλ be the finite group given in 3.12. For a certain quotient group
Aλ of Aλ with F 2 -action, we put
                                                 δ
                                     Ms,N = Aλ × (Aλ )∧δ ,
                                                                               (m)   2
where δ is the action of F 2 on Aλ and on (Aλ )∧ as before. Let (Ts,E )F be the set
                                           2m
of F 2 -stable irreducible characters of GF belonging to Ms,E . Then there exists a
                               (m) 2            (m)
parametrization Ms,N ↔ (Ts,E )F via (c, ξ) ↔ ρc,ξ satisfying the following properties.
22

Put Mfs,N = Aδ × (Aλ )∧ . Since M      fs,N is a subset of Aδ × (Aλ )∧ , one can define an F 2 -
               λ         δ                                   λ           δ

                                                                                        fs,N →
stable character Γc,ξ of GF for each pair (c, ξ) ∈ Ms,N (see 3.13). Let ϕ : M
Ms,N be the natural projection. Then for (c, ξ) ∈ M        fs,N and (c′ , ξ ′) ∈ Ms,N , we have
the following (cf. [S3, Corollary 2.21]).
                                            (
                           (m) (m)            1    if ϕ(c, ξ) = (c′ , ξ ′),

                                              0    otherwise.

Assume that ϕ(c, ξ) = (c′ , ξ ′ ), i.e., ξ = ξ ′ and c′ is the image of c under the map

Aλ → Aλ . Let Γec,ξ and ρec′ ,ξ′ be extensions of Γc,ξ and ρc′ ,ξ′ to GF hδi, respectively.
                                                                        2m


                               (m)
Now by Proposition 3.14, Γe | F 2m is an eigenfunction for τ ∗ with eigenvalue ξ(c).
                                 c,ξ   G      δ                                        1
        (m)                                                 (m)
Since  ρc′ ,ξ′
          occurs in the decomposition of                   Γc,ξ     with multiplicity 1 by (3.15.1), by
applying Theorem 3.9 we see that

                                  ρc′ ,ξ′ |GF 2m δ ) = ξ ′ (c′ )(e
                                                                 ρc′ ,ξ′ |GF 2m δ ).

(Note that ξ(c) = ξ ′ (c′ )). The set (Ts,E )F is also parametrized by the set Ms,E
     (m)
via ρη,z ↔ (η, z) ∈ Ms,E . They are related to each other through the bijection
Ms,N ↔ Ms,E , (c′ , ξ ′) ↔ (η, z) which satisfies the condition that ξ ′(c′ ) = η(z). Thus
we have

(3.15.3)                      τ1∗ (e(m)
                                   ρη,z |GF 2m δ ) = η(z)(e(m)
                                                          ρη,z |GF 2m δ ).

Now the theorem follows from Theorem 3.4, in view of the commutativity of t∗−1
                                                                           1   and
 ∗
τ1 given in (3.8.1). This completes the proof of the theorem.




                          4. Determination of m2 (ρṡ,E |GF 2 )


     4.1. Assume that s is F 2 -stable, and the pair (s, T ∗) is given as in Section 2. Let
ρṡ,E be an irreducible character of G   e F 2 as in 2.2. In this section, we shall compute the
value m2 (ρṡ,E |GF 2 ). Now ρṡ,E is given as
                                                          X
(4.1.1)               ρṡ,E = εGe ∗ εZGe (ṡ) |Wṡ |−1                    e e∗ (ṡ),
                                                                  Tr (wδ, E)RTw
                                                          w∈Wṡ


where εH = (−1)Fq2 −rank(H) for any reductive group H, and E   e is a certain extension of
              δ
E ∈ (Irr Wṡ ) to Wṡ hδi. Therefore we compute the value m2 (RTew∗ (ṡ)) for each w ∈ Ws .
    We consider the isomorphism Ze∗F ≃ (G     eF 2 /GF 2 )∧ as in (2.4.1), and a similar

norm map z → zF (z). The norm map is also described as in 1.1. By using this, it
is easy to see that Ker NF 2 /F coincides with the subset {z −1 F (z) | z ∈ Ze∗F }, and so
                                                                                2

    First we note the following general fact.

Lemma 4.2. Let χ be a class function of G

But for any linear character θe of G              e e F = θ, we have

Thus the lemma is proved.                                                                  

    By applying the above formula to the class function RTew∗ (ṡ) of G

corresponds to a linear character θe of G    eF 2 /GF 2 , which is an extension of θ. Now it is
known that RTew∗ (ṡ) ⊗ θe = RTew∗ (ṡż). Hence the lemma follows from Lemma 4.2.           
     We have the following proposition.
Proposition 4.4. Let s be an element in Tw∗ such that F 2 (s) = s.
                                  2
     (i) Assume that the G∗F -orbit of s does not contain s′ such that F (s′ ) = s′ −1 .
         Then m2 (RTew∗ (ṡ)|GF 2 ) = 0 for any ṡ ∈ Tew∗ such that π(ṡ) = s.
    (ii) Assume that F (s) = s−1 . Then there exists ṡ ∈ Tew∗ such that π(ṡ) = s and that
         F (ṡ) = ṡ−1 , and we have
                                                    X
(4.4.1)                     m2 (RTew∗ (ṡ)|GF 2 ) =     m2 (RTew∗ (ṡzx )),

        where Ω−γ                        −1                       δ
                s = {x ∈ Ωs | γ(x) = x } is the subgroup of Ωs , and zx ∈ Z
                                                                                e∗F 2 is a
        representative of an element in (Ze∗F )F such that zx F (zx ) = ωs (x) under the
                                             2


        map ωs : Ωδs → Zeṡ∗F ⊂ Ze∗F (see 2.4).
                             2      2



Proof. First we show (i). It is known that RTew∗ (ṡ)|GF 2 coincides with the Deligne-
                                     2
Lusztig character RTw∗ (s) of GF . Then by [L3, 2.7 (a)], we have m2 (RTw∗ (s)) = 0.
(Note that in [loc. cit.], it is assumed that the center of G is connected. However, the
above fact holds without this assumption, by 2.3 and 2.6 (b) in [loc. cit.]). Thus (i)
holds.
     Next we show (ii). Assume that F (s) = s−1 . Take ṡ1 ∈ Te∗ such that π(ṡ1 ) = s.
Then there exists some z ∈ Ze∗ such that F (ṡ1 ) = ṡ−1                      e∗
                                                            1 z for some z ∈ Z . Take
z1 ∈ Ze∗ ≃ Gm such that z = z1 F (z1 ) = z1 , and put ṡ = ṡ1 z1 . Then π(ṡ) = s and
                                                q+1

F (ṡ) = ṡ−1 as asserted.
     Take ṡ as above, and consider the formula (4.3.1). Again by [L3, Lemma 2.8], we
may only consider, in the sum of the right hand side of (4.3.1), z ∈ (Ze∗F )F such that
                                                                            2


                                     e∗ . Here we note that
F (ṡż) is conjugate to (ṡż)−1 in G
(4.4.2) F (ṡż) is conjugate to (ṡż)−1 if and only if there exists x ∈ Ω−γ
                                                                           s  such that
żF (ż) = ωs (x).
      We show (4.4.2). Assume that x ∈ Ω−γ                                                 e∗
                                                    s , and let ẋ be an element in G such
that π(ẋ) is a representative of x. Then by (2.11.1), ωs (x) = ṡ−1 ẋṡẋ−1 ∈ Ze∗F
                                                                                                      2


is γ-stable, i.e., ωs (x) ∈ Ze∗F . Hence by (4.1.2) there exists ż ∈ Ze∗F such that
                                                                                      2


ωs (x) = żF (ż). It follows that ṡż = ẋṡẋ−1 F (ż)−1 , and we have F (ṡż) = ẋ−1 (ṡż)−1 ẋ.
This shows that F (ṡż) is conjugate to (ṡż)−1 in G    e ∗ . Conversely, assume that F (ṡż) is
conjugate to (ṡż)−1 in G    e∗ . Then there exists ẋ ∈ G   e∗ such that F (ṡż) = ẋ−1 (ṡż)−1 ẋ.
Clearly π(ẋ) ∈ ZG∗ (s), and its image in Ωs determines an element x ∈ Ωs . Since
ṡ(żF (ż)) = ẋṡẋ−1 , we have żF (ż) ∈ Zes∗F . Moreover, żF (ż) is γ-stable. Hence by
                                                  2


(2.4.2) and (2.11.1), we see that x ∈ Ω−γ     s . This proves (4.4.2).
                         e ∗F
      Since ωs (x) ∈ Z , ż ∈ Z     e ∗F 2
                                           such that żF (ż) = ωs (x) has a unique image on
  e ∗F 2      e ∗F
(Z )F ≃ Z by (4.1.2). We choose zx from such ż for each x. Then the formula
(4.4.1) is immediate from (4.4.2).                                                                  
                                                                                                  25

    By using Lusztig’s formula in [L3], we shall compute the right hand side of (4.4.1)
explicitly. We show
Lemma 4.5. Under the notation in Proposition 4.4 (ii), we have

                          m2 (RTew∗ (ṡzx )) = ♯{u ∈ Wṡ | w = u(xγ u)}.

Proof. Take ẋ ∈ NGe ∗ (Te∗ ) whose image in W is a representative of x ∈ Ω−γ      s . We note
that one can choose ẋ such that F (ẋ) = ẋ . In fact, take any x ∈ NGe ∗ (Te∗ ) in the
                                                   −1                        ′

inverse image of x. Since γ(x) = x−1 , we have x′ F (x′ ) = t ∈ Te∗ . We can find t1 ∈ Te∗
such that t−1      2                        ′
               1 F (t1 ) = t. Then ẋ = t1 x F (t1 )
                                                     −1
                                                        satisfies the required condition.
     Take g ∈ G     e such that g F (g) = ẋ. Put s′ = g (ṡzx ), Te′ = g Te∗ and W ′ =
                     ∗             −1

NGe ∗ (Te′ )/Te′ . Then F (s′) = s′ −1 , F (Te′ ) = Te′ , and s′ ∈ Te′ . Moreover, we have
g −1F 2 (g) = ẋF (ẋ) = 1 and so g ∈ G      e∗F 2 . We have an isomorphism f : W ∼ W ′
                                                                                           →
                                                                                           −
via ad g, and we see that the pair (s′ , Tef′ (w) ) is G e∗F 2 -conjugate to the pair (ṡzx , Tew∗ ),
where Tef′ (w) is an F 2 -stable maximal torus obtained from Te′ by twisting by f (w) ∈ W ′ .
     It follows that

(4.5.1)                                 RTew∗ (ṡzx ) = RTe′       (s′ ).
                                                           f (w)


                                                                            ∼ Ws′′ . Now It
If we put Ws′′ = {w ′ ∈ W ′ | w ′(s′ ) = s′ }, f induces an isomorphism Wṡ →
                                                                            −
is known by [L3, Lemma 2.8, (b)] that

(4.5.2)                 m2 (RTe′       (s′ )) = ♯{y ∈ Ws′′ | f (w) = yF (y)}.
                               f (w)



Hence, by (4.5.1) and (4.5.2), we have

                     m2 (RTew (ṡzx )) = ♯{u ∈ Wṡ | f (w) = f (u)F (f (u))}
                                         = ♯{u ∈ Wṡ | w = u(xγ u)},

since F ◦ f = f ◦ ẋF . This proves the lemma.                                                    
    We are in a position to determine m2 (ρṡ,E |GF 2 ).
                                                      eF 2 as before, and put s = π(ṡ).
Theorem 4.6. Let ρṡ,E be an irreducible character of G
                          2
    (i) If s is not G∗F -conjugate to s′ such that F (s′ ) = s′ −1 , then m2 (ρṡ,E |GF 2 ) = 0.
   (ii) Assume that F (s) = s−1 . Then we have
                         (
                          |Ω−γ
                            s (E)|    if there exists x ∈ Ω−γ
                                                            s    such that xγ E = E ,
     m2 (ρṡ,E |GF 2 ) =
                          0           otherwise,

          where Ω−γ                               −γ
                 s (E) is the stabilizer of E in Ωs .

Proof. ρṡ,E is given as in (4.1.1). Thus (i) is immediate from Proposition 4.4 (i). We
show (ii). So, assume that F (s) = s−1 . Since RTew∗ (ṡ) |GF 2 does not depend on the choice
of a representative ṡ of s, we may assume that ṡ satisfies the property that F (ṡ) = ṡ−1 .

    Now by Lemma 2.11 in [L3] (see also the formula in the proof of Proposition 2.13
there), one can write

                                 xγ



where (Wṡ )∧xγ is the set of xγ-stable characters of Wṡ , and the extension E    e′ of E ′ is
chosen to be realized over Q. (Note that (xγ)2 = δ since x ∈ Ω−γ   s ). It follows that

the theorem is proved.                                                                                    

     We shall apply the formula in the theorem to the case ρṡx ,E ′ . First we note that
Lemma 4.7. Assume that F (s) = s−1 . Let sy be an element corresponding to y ∈
                      2
(Ωs )δ . Then the G∗F -class of sy contains an element s′ such that F (s′ ) = s′ −1 if and
only if there exists u ∈ Ωs such that uF (u) gives a representative of y in Ωs .
Proof. Let ẏ ∈ ZG∗ (s) be a representative of y. Let s′ be an element contained in
          2
the G∗F -class of sy . Then s′ can be obtained as s′ = g s for some g ∈ G∗ such that
g −1F 2 (g) = ẏ. It is easy to see that F (s′ ) = s′ −1 if and only if g −1 F (g) ∈ ZG∗ (s).
Hence y = uF (u) in Ωs if we put u the image of g −1F (g) in Ωs .                          

   4.8. We prepare a notation. Let s be a semisimple element such that F (s) = s−1 ,
                                                                              e s (E)+
and E ∈ Irr Ws0 such that the Ωs -orbit of E is F -stable. We define a subset Ω      δ
                                                                                            27

(resp. Ωs (E)+      e
             δ ) of Ωs (E)δ (resp. of Ωs (E)δ ) by

           e s (E)+ = the image of {uγ(u) | u ∈ Ωs , uγ E = E} into Ω
           Ω                                                        e s (E)δ ,
                  δ
           Ωs (E)+
                 δ = the image of {vγ(v) | v ∈ Ωs (E)} into Ωs (E)δ .

Then we can see that there exists aE ∈ Ωs such that

(4.8.1)                            e s (E)+ = Ωs (E)+ aE .
                                   Ω      δ         δ

In fact, since the Ωs -orbit of E is γ-stable, there exists b ∈ Ωs such that bγ E = E.
Then aE = bγ(b) is contained in Ωe s (E), and we have Ω
                                                      e s (E) = Ωs (E)aE . (4.8.1) follows
from this.
    As a corollary to Theorem 4.6, we have the following.

Corollary 4.9. Assume that s is semisimple in G∗ such that F (s) = s−1 , and that
                           e s (E)δ and let (E, y) ↔ (x, Ex ) be as in (2.2.2). Then we

Proof. If m2 (ρṡx ,Ex ) 6= 0, then sx is GF -conjugate to some s′ such that F (s′ ) = s′ −1 .
Since x and y are in the same class in (Ωs )δ , there exists u ∈ Ωs such that uF (u) = y
by Lemma 4.7. Let u̇ ∈ ZG∗ (s) be a representative of u. Then there exists g ∈ G∗
such that g −1F (g) = u̇. We see that g −1 F 2 (g) = u̇F (u̇) is a representative of y. Hence
we may assume sx = sy = g s and Ex = E. Then ad g −1 gives rise to an isomorphism
     ∼ Ws0 , and ad g −1 sends F, F 2 to uF, yF 2, respectively. Moreover, E ′′ ∈ Irr Ws0x
Ws0x −
     →
in (2.2.2) is mapped to E ′ = E ∈ Irr Ws0 . Then by Theorem 4.6, m2 (ρsx ,Ex ) 6= 0
is equivalent to the condition that there exists h ∈ Ω−γ    s (E) such that
                                                                               huγ
                                                                                   E = E. In
particular, the Ωs -orbit of E is F -stable. Since huγ(hu) = uγ(u) = y, this is equivalent
to y ∈ Ωe s (E)+ . This proves the corollary.                                              

                 5. Determination of m2 (ρ) for ρ ∈ Irr SLn (Fq2 )

     5.1. In this section, we shall determine m2 (ρ) for all irreducible characters of
 F2                                                             2
G . Our strategy is to compute m2 for almost characters of GF first, and then derive
the formula for m2 (ρ) from it.
     First we prepare some notation. Let s be an F 2 -stable semisimple element in
G∗ , and E an F 2 -stable irreducible character of Ws0 . We recall two sets Ms,E =
           e s (E)δ and Ms,E = Ωs (E)∧ × Ωs (E)δ . Assuming that F (s) = s−1 and that
Ωδs (E)∧ × Ω                         δ
28

the Ωs -orbit of E is F -stable, we define subsets Ωδs (E)∧− ⊂ Ωδs (E)∧−γ ⊂ Ωδs (E)∧ by

                         Ωδs (E)∧−γ = {θ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧ | γ(θ) = θ−1 },
                          Ωδs (E)∧− = {θ−1 γ(θ) | θ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧ }.

                         e s (E)+ ⊂ Ω
We also consider subsets Ω          e s (E)γ ⊂ Ω
                                               e s (E)δ , where
                                δ          δ

                           e s (E)γ = {u ∈ Ω
                           Ω               e s (E)δ | γ(u) = u},
                                  δ


and Ωe s (E)+ is defined as in 4.8. We define subsets Ωs (E)+ ⊂ Ωs (E)γ ⊂ Ωs (E)δ in a
            δ                                                δ          δ
similar way as above.
    Put
                     |Ωs (E)δ | = t, |Ωs (E)γ | = d, |Ωs (E)−γ | = d′ .
Then we see easily that

                                |Ωδs (E)∧ | = |Ωs (E)δ | = t,
                                |Ωδs (E)∧γ | = |Ωs (E)γδ | = d,
                               |Ωδs (E)∧−γ | = |Ωs (E)−γ     ′
                                                      δ | = d.


Since Ωs (E)δ is a cyclic group, Ωs (E)δ is written as a product of Ωs (E)γ and Ωs (E)−γ .
If t = |Ωs (E)δ | is even, Ωs (E)δ contains a unique element of order 2. In that case
Ωs (E)γ and Ωs (E)−γ has a non-trivial intersection, and so t = dd′/2. If t is odd, then
Ωs (E)δ = Ωs (E)γ × Ωs (E)−γ , and so t = dd′ .
     There is a surjective homomorphism Ωδs (E)∧ → Ωδs (E)∧− given by θ → θ−1 F (θ),
whose kernel is given by Ωδs (E)∧γ . It follows that Ωδs (E)∧− is a subgroup of Ωδs (E)∧−γ of
order t/d. Hence we have
                                                   (
                                                    1    if t = dd′,
(5.1.1)                [Ωδs (E)∧−γ : Ωδs (E)∧− ] =
                                                    2    if t = dd′/2.

     Similarly, we have a surjective homomorphism Ωs (E)δ → Ωs (E)+         δ given by z 7→
zF (z) with kernel Ωs (E)−γ
                          δ  . It follows  that Ω s (E) +
                                                        δ  is a subgroup of Ω     γ
                                                                             s (E)δ of degree
t/d′ . Hence we have
                                                (
                                                 1        if t = dd′ ,
(5.1.2)                [Ωs (E)γδ : Ωs (E)+
                                         δ  ] =
                                                 2        if t = dd′ /2.
                                                                                     2
     The following result describes the values of m2 for almost characters of GF .
                                                                    2
Theorem 5.2. Assume that s is a semisimple element in G∗F , and E is an irreducible
character of Ws0 such that Ωs -orbit of E is F 2 -stable. Let Rη,z be an almost character
associated to (η, z) ∈ Ms,E . Then
     (i) Assume that s is not G∗ -conjugate to an element s′ such that F (s′ ) = s′ −1 .
         Then m2 (Rη,z ) = 0.
                                                                                               29

    (ii) Assume that F (s) = s−1 . If the Ωs -orbit of E is not F -stable, then m2 (Rη,z ) =
         0.
   (iii) Assume that F (s) = s−1 , and that the Ωs -orbit of E is F -stable.
          (a) Assume that |Ωs (E)δ | is odd. Then we have
                               (
                                 1      if η ∈ Ωs (E)∧−γ and z ∈ Ωs (E)γ ,
                  m2 (Rη,z ) =
                                 0      otherwise.

         (b) Assume that |Ωs (E)δ | is even. Then we have
                        
                        
                        1      if η ∈ Ωs (E)∧−γ and z ∈ Ωs (E)+ ,
            m2 (Rη,z ) = ε      if η ∈ Ωs (E)∧−γ and z ∈ Ωs (E)γ − Ωs (E)+ ,
                        
                        0      otherwise,

                                                         e s (E)γ − Ω
             where ε = c2 (ρ1,z0′′ ) = ±1 for any z0′′ ∈ Ω          e s (E)+ .
                                                                δ          δ

Proof. We show (i). By Theorem 4.6 (i), m2 (ρṡx ,Ex |GF 2 ) = 0 for any x ∈ (Ωs )δ . It
follows that m2 (ρη′ ,z ′ ) = 0 for any (η ′ , z ′ ) ∈ Ms,E . Hence m2 (Rη,z ) = 0 for any
(η, z) ∈ Ms,E .
     A similar proof works for the assertion (ii) since m2 (ρṡx ,Ex ) = 0 for any x ∈ (Ωs )δ
by Corollary 4.9 (i).
     We show (iii) by computing m2 (Rη,z ) for (η, z) ∈ Ms,E . By Theorem 3.6, we have
m2 (Rη,z ) = η(z)−1 m2 (t∗−11 Rη,z ). By definition of Rη,z , together with Corollary 1.11,
applied to the case where r = 2, we have
                                          X
(5.2.1)          m2 (Rη,z ) = η(z)−1                 {(η, z), (η ′, z ′ )}c2 (ρη′ ,z ′a ).
                                         (η′ ,z ′ a)∈Ms,E


with a = aE . Moreover by Corollary 1.16 (applied to the case where m = 1, see also
[K2, Theorem 2.1.3]), together with Proposition 2.7, we have
                                  (
                                    ±1 if (η ′ , z ′ ) ∈ Ωδs (E)∧−γ × Ωs (E)γδ ,
(5.2.2)        c2 (ρη′ ,z ′ a ) =
                                    0  otherwise.

We note the following.

(5.2.3) Assume that z ′ ∈ Ωs (E)+                                      ′   δ    ∧
                                δ . Then c2 (ρη′ ,z ′ a ) = 1 for any η ∈ Ωs (E)−γ .


    We show (5.2.3). Let (x, Ex ) corresponding to (E, z ′ ) via f in (2.2.2). Then we
have m2 (ρṡx ,Ex |GF 2 ) = |Ωs (E)−γ | by Corollary 4.9. Since the twisting operator t∗1 acts
trivially on ρṡx ,Ex , we have c2 (ρṡx .Ex |GF 2 ) = |Ωs (E)−γ | by Corollary 1.11. On the other
hand, ρṡx ,Ex can be decomposed as in (2.2.3). Hence by (5.2.2), we have
                                                         X
                            c2 (ρṡx ,Ex |GF 2 ) =                   c2 (ρη′ ,z ′a ).
                                                     η′ ∈Ωδs (E)∧
                                                                −γ
30

Since |Ωs (E)−γ | = |Ωδs (E)∧−γ | = d′ , we can conclude that c2 (ρη′ ,z ′ a ) = 1, and (5.2.3)
follows.
     We now compute m2 (Rη,z ). In view of (5.2.2), the formula (5.2.1) can be written
as
                                                    X
(5.2.4)      m2 (Rη,z ) = η(z)−1 |Ωδs (E)|−1                   η(z ′ )η ′ (z)c2 (ρη′ ,z ′ a ).
                                                                                     γ
                                                         (η′ ,z ′ )∈Ωδs (E)∧
                                                                           −γ ×Ωs (E)δ



First consider the case where t is odd, i.e., the case where t = dd′ . Then by (5.1.2),
we have Ωs (E)γδ = Ωs (E)+
                         δ . It follows by (5.2.3) that
                                                                       X
               m2 (Rη,z ) = η(z)−1 |Ωδs (E)|−1                                             η(z ′ )η ′ (z).
                                                                                       γ
                                                           (η′ ,z ′ )∈Ωδs (E)∧
                                                                             −γ ×Ωs (E)δ



This implies that m2 (Rη,z ) = 0 unless η is trivial on Ωs (E)γδ and z ∈ Ωδs (E) is such
that η ′ (z) = 1 for any η ′ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧−γ . But since Ωδs (E)∧−γ = Ωδs (E)∧− , the condition for
z is equivalent to the condition that z ∈ Ωs (E)γ . Similarly, since Ωs (E)γδ = Ωs (E)+       δ ,
                                                                         ∧
the condition for η is equivalent to the condition that η ∈ Ωs (E)−γ . Now assume that
η ∈ Ωδs (E)∧−γ and z ∈ Ωs (E)γ . Since |Ωδs (E)| = |Ωδs (E)∧−γ | × |Ωs (E)γδ |, and η(z) = 1,
(5.2.4) implies that m2 (Rη,z ) = 1. This proves (a) of (iii).
    Next we consider the case where t is even, i.e., the case where t = dd′ /2. In
this case, Ωδs (E)∧− is an index two subgroup of Ωδs (E)∧−γ , and Ωs (E)+     δ is an index two
                     γ                                                        γ
subgroup of Ωs (E)δ . We fix η0 ∈ Ωs (E)−γ − Ωs (E)− and z0 ∈ Ωs (E)δ − Ωs (E)+
                                 ′      δ    ∧      δ    ∧       ′
                                                                                        δ . Then
by using (5.2.3), (5.2.4) can be written as
                                                                        X
(5.2.5)          m2 (Rη,z ) = η(z)−1 |Ωδs (E)|−1                                           η(z ′ )η ′ (z)Aη′ ,z ′ ,
                                                                                       +
                                                            (η′ ,z ′ )∈Ωδs (E)∧
                                                                              − ×Ωs (E)δ



where

             Aη′ ,z ′ = 1 + η0′ (z) + η(z0′ )c2 (ρη′ ,z ′ z0′ a ) + η(z0′ )η0′ (z)c2 (ρη′ η0′ ,z ′ z0′ a ).

It is known by Corollary 3.5 that
                               (
                                1                    if (η, z) ∈ Ωs (E)∧−γ × Ωs (E)γ ,
(5.2.6)         |m2 (Rη,z )| =
                                0                    otherwise.

    We now assume that m2 (Rη,z ) 6= 0. Hence η ∈ Ωs (E)∧−γ and z ∈ Ωs (E)γ . We
note that η ∈ Ωs (E)∧ is contained in Ωs (E)∧−γ if and only if η is trivial on Ωs (E)+        δ .
Similarly, η ′ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧ is contained in Ωδs (E)∧− if and only if η ′ is trivial on Ωs (E)γ .
In particular, we have η(z ′ ) = η ′ (z) = 1 for any (η ′ , z ′ ) ∈ Ωδs (E)∧− × Ωs (E)+
                                                                                      δ . in the
                              ′         ′
sum in (5.2.5). Since η(z), η0 (z), η(z0 ) take values ±1, we see that m2 (Rη,z ) ∈ Q. This
implies that m2 (Rη,z ) = ±1 by (5.2.6).
    We shall consider the two cases, whether z ∈ Ωs (E)γ is contained in ∈ Ωs (E)+ or
not. First assume that z ∈ Ωs (E)+ . Then η(z) = 1, η0′ (z) = 1 and η(z0′ ) = ±1. Since
                                                                                                                       31

|Ωδs (E)∧− | × |Ωs (E)+
                      δ | = t/2, it follows from (5.2.5) that
                                                 X
                   m2 (Rη,z )t = t +                         η(z0′ )(c2 (ρη′ ,z ′z0′ a ) + c2 (ρη′ e′0 ,z ′z0′ a )).
                                                (η′ ,z ′ )


Let C be the sum part of this formula. Then we have −t ≤ C ≤ t. Since m2 (Rη,z ) =
±1, this forces that C = 0, and we have m2 (Rη,z ) = 1.
    Next assume that z ∈ Ωs (E)γ −Ωs (E)+ . Since z −1 z0′ ∈ Ωs (E)+                               −1 ′
                                                                                    δ , we have η(z z0 ) =
               ′
1. Moreover η0 (z) = −1. Hence by (5.2.5), we can write
                                   X
                     m2 (Rη,z )t =   (c2 (ρη′ ,z ′ z0′ a ) − c2 (ρη′ η0′ ,z ′z0′ a )).
                                                 (η′ ,z ′ )


But since             X
                                  |c2 (ρη′ ,z ′ z0′ a ) − c2 (ρη′ η0′ ,z ′z0′ a )| ≤ t = |m2 (Rη,z )t|,
                     (η′ ,z ′ )

we see that c2 (ρη′ ,z ′ z0′ a ) = −c2 (ρη′ η0′ ,z ′ z0′ a ) has a common value for any (η ′ , z ′ ), which
coincides with c2 (ρ1,z0′ a ) = −c2 (ρη0′ ,z0′ a ). This implies that m2 (Rη,z ) = c2 (ρ1,z0′ a ) = ε.
By putting z0′′ = z0′ a, we obtain the theorem.                                                          
    We can now easily translate Theorem 5.2 to the form on m2 (ρ) for irreducible
characters ρ.
                                                                                                       2
Theorem 5.3. Assume that s is a semisimple element in G∗F , and that E ∈ Irr Ws0
is such that the Ωs -orbit of E is F 2 -stable. Let ρη′ ,ζ ′′ be an irreducible character of
    2
GF associated to (η ′ , z ′′ ) ∈ Ms,E . Then
     (i) Assume that s is not G∗ -conjugate to an element s′ such that F (s′ ) = s′ −1 .
         Then m2 (ρη′ ,z ′′ ) = 0.
    (ii) Assume that F (s) = s−1 . If the Ωs -orbit of E is not F -stable, then m2 (ρη′ ,z ′′ ) =
         0.
   (iii) Assume that F (s) = s−1 and that the Ωs -orbit of E is F -stable.
          (a) Assume that |Ωs (E)δ | is odd. Then we have
                                   (
                                    1                                  e s (E)γ ,
                                        if η ′ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧−γ and z ′′ ∈ Ω      δ
                 m2 (ρη′ ,z ′′ ) =
                                    0   otherwise.

          (b) Assume that |Ωs (E)δ | is even. Then we have

          m2 (ρη′ ,z ′′ ) = 1 − ε                                              e s (E)+

               where ε = c2 (ρ1,z0′′ ) = ±1 for any z0′′ ∈ Ω          e s (E)+ .
                                                                  δ          δ

Proof. The assertion (i) and (ii) are already shown in the proof of Theorem 5.2. We
show (iii). First assume that |Ωs (E)δ | is odd. Then (3.3.2) implies, in view of Theorem
32

5.2, that
                                                            X
                 m2 (ρη′ ,z ′ a ) = |Ωs (E)δ |−1                              η(z ′ )−1 η ′ (z)−1 .
                                                   (η,z)∈Ωs (E)∧         γ
                                                               −γ ×Ωs (E)

It follows that m2 (ρη′ ,z ′a ) = 0 unless η ′ is trivial on Ωs (E)γ , and η(z ′ ) = 1 for any
η ∈ Ωs (E)∧−γ , and in which case m2 (ρη′ ,z ′ a ) = 1. But this condition is equivalent to
the condition that η ′ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧−γ and z ′ ∈ Ωs (E)+                           ′         ′′
                                                       δ . By replacing z a by z , we obtain
(a).
     Next assume that |Ωs (E)δ | is even. Let us fix z0 ∈ Ωs (E)γ − Ωs (E)+ . Again by
Theorem 5.2, we have
                                           X
        m2 (ρη′ ,z ′a ) = |Ωs (E)δ |−1                   η(z ′ )−1 η ′ (z)−1 (1 + η ′ (z0 )−1 ε).
                                          (η,z)∈Ωs (E)∧         +
                                                      −γ ×Ωs (E)



It follows that m2 (ρη′ ,z ′a ) = 0 unless η ′ is trivial on Ωδs (E)+ and η(z ′ ) = 1 for any
η ∈ Ωs (E)∧−γ , and in which case m2 (ρη′ ,z ′a ) = 1 + η ′ (z0 )−1 ε. The condition for z ′ is the
same as before, and η ′ is trivial on Ωδs (E)+ if and only if η ′ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧−γ . Moreover,
                                  (
                          ′        1                if η ′ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧− ,
                        η (z0 ) =
                                   −1               if η ′ ∈ Ωδs (E)∧−γ − Ωδs (E)∧− .

Hence (b) holds, and the theorem is proved.                                                           

Remark 5.4. In [L3], Lusztig gave a uniform description of m2 (ρ) for any irreducible
                  2
character ρ of GF in the case where G is a connected reductive group with connected
center. He expects that his formulation will be extended also to the disconnected
center case. We shall compare our results with Lusztig’s conjectural description. Take
                        e s (E)δ , take a representative ż ∈ Ωs (E) of z, and put
(η, z) ∈ Ms,E . For z ∈ Ω
            √
                z = the image of {y ∈ Ωs | yγ E = E, (yγ)2 = żδ} into Ωs (E)δ .
                      √                                              √
Then Ωs (E)δ acts on z by the F -twisted conjugation.
                                                  √   We  denote by    z the corre-
sponding permutation representation also. Let [η : z] the multiplicity of η in this
permutation representation. Now assume that F (s) = s−1 and that the Ωs -orbit of E
is F -stable. Then we have the following.
                                         e s (E)+ . Then we have
(5.4.1) Assume that (η, z) ∈ Ωδs (E)∧− × Ω      δ
                                              (
                                     √         1         if |Ωs (E)δ | is odd,
                              [η :       z] =
                                               2         if |Ωs (E)δ | is even.

                        e s (E)+ , then we have [η :          √
          / Ωδs (E)∧− × Ω
If (η, z) ∈                    δ                                    z] = 0.
                                                       e s (E)δ such that √z 6= ∅. Hence if
                            e s (E)+ is the set of z ∈ Ω
   In fact, in our setting, Ω      δ
z∈ e s (E)+ , then √z = ∅, and so [η : √z] = 0. If z ∈ Ω
  /Ω                                                     e s (E)+ , then √z = Ωs (E)−γ y for
         √δ                                                    √δ                   δ
some y ∈ z. Let χ be the character of the representation z. Then χ(u) = |Ωs (E)−γ        δ |
                                                                                                    33

if u ∈ Ωs (E)γ and χ(u) = 0 otherwise. It follows that
                       (
                 √       |Ωs (E)−γ        γ         δ
                                δ ||Ωs (E) |/|Ωs (E) |                if η ∈ Ωδs (E)∧− ,
             [η : z] =
                         0                                            otherwise.

(5.4.1) follows from this.            √
    In the connected center case, [η : z] gives
                                             √ the value m2 (ρ). In our situation, by
comparing with Theorem 5.3, we see that [η : z] coincides with m2 (ρη,z ) if c2 (ρ1,z0 ) =
1 for z0 ∈ Ωe s (E)γ − Ω
                       e s (E)+ .
