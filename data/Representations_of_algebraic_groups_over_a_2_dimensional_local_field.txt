                                                     Abstract. We introduce a categorical framework for the study of representations of G(F),
                                                     where G is a reductive group, and F is a 2-dimensional local field, i.e., F = K((t)), where K
                                                     is a local field.
                                                         Our main result says that the space of functions on G(F), which is an object of a suitable
                                                     category of representations of G(F) with the respect to the action of G on itself by left trans-
                                                     lations, becomes a representation of a certain central extension of G(F), when we consider
                                                     the action by right translations.




                                                                                           Introduction
                                             0.1. Let K be a local field, and let us consider the field F = K((t)). In his paper [8], Kapranov
                                             studied a certain representation of the group G(F), where G is a reductive group over K. He
                                             introduced a pro-vector space (we will denote it by V), on which the group G(F) acts in a
                                             continuous way, and which may be thought of as an analogue of a principal series representation
                                             of usual p-adic groups.
                                                Namely, V is the (pro)-vector space of locally constant functions with compact support on
                                             the set of K-points on the base affine space of the loop group G((t)). (We remind that this
                                             base affine space is a principal T -bundle over the affine flag scheme corresponding to G, where
                                             T is the Cartan subgroup.)
                                                Kapranov wrote down a certain algebra of endomorphisms of V generated by explicit inter-
                                             twining operators, and proved that this algebra is isomorphic to the (modified) double affine
                                             Hecke algebra. This double affine Hecke algebra, which was introduced and studied by Chered-
                                             nik, is clearly an object of great importance, and Kapranov’s work explained that it is related to
                                             groups over a 2-dimensional field, such as F, in the same way as the usual affine Hecke algebra
                                             is related to p-adic groups.

                                             0.2. The present paper grew out of an attempt to put Kapranov’s ideas and results into
                                             a categorical framework. Our goal is to find a category of smooth representations, let us
                                             denote it Rep(G), which would contain Kapranov’s representation (and its close relatives) as
                                             objects. Moreover, we want Rep(G) to be abelian, so that the usual representation-theoretic
                                             questions, such as irreducibility, would make sense in it. We also want Rep(G) to be as “rigid”
                                             or “constrained” as possible, and finally we want the definition of Rep(G) to resemble the
                                             definition of the category of smooth representations for usual p-adic groups.
                                                After some categorical preliminaries in Sect. 1, we propose a definition of Rep(G) in Sect. 2.
                                             A somewhat surprising feature of Rep(G) is that, unlike most abelian categories that arise in
                                             representation theory, the natural forgetful functor defined on Rep(G) does not map to the
                                             category of vector spaces, but rather to the category Vect of pro-vector spaces. We remark
                                             that for the purposes of this paper, one could restrict to the subcategory Vectℵ0 of projective
                                             systems indexed by countable sets.
                                                                                                    1

   Let us recall that Vect is an abelian category, but it is not semi-simple. In fact, the subcat-
egory Vectℵ0 has cohomological dimension ≤ 1, and it can be visualized as follows: An object
of Vectℵ0 is called strict if it can be represented as a (filtering, countable) inverse system of
vector spaces Vi , such that the arrows Vi → Vj are surjective. Strict objects of Vectℵ0 are the
same as vector spaces endowed with a linear topology, with a countable fundamental system of
neighbourhoods of zero, in which they are separated and complete. However, as is well-known,
the category of such topological vector spaces is not abelian, which corresponds to the fact that
strict objects of Vectℵ0 do not form an abelian subcategory.
   We do have a (left-exact) functor limP roj : Vect → V ect, but the point of view taken in this
paper, and which is largely borrowed from [8], is that we really have to work with the abelian
category Vect, and avoid taking projective limits.

  We justify the appearance of Vect by showing that G(F) does not have representations in
any reasonable sense, unless we admit pro-vector spaces.

 0.3. In Sect. 3 we show, generalizing the basic construction of [8], how to produce non-trivial
 objects of Rep(G).
    Namely, let H be a subgroup of G(F), contained in the group G[[t]](K) of K-points of
 the group G[[t]] and equal to the preimage of a closed subgroup of (G[[t]]/Gi )(K) for some
 congruence subgroup Gi . Then, representations of H on vector spaces, as well as on pro-vector
 spaces, are notions that are easy to recover from the usual representation theory of p-adic
 groups.
    We define two functors eiG        G
                              H and iH from Rep(H, Vect) to Rep(G), such that the former is the
 right adjoint to the tautological restriction functor Rep(H, Vect) → Rep(G). (In other words,
eiG should be thought of as an ordinary induction functor, whereas we think of iG as some sort
  H                                                                                  H
 of semi-infinite induction, by analogy with the theory of modules over vertex algebras, cf. [1].)
    Kapranov’s representation V is exactly of the form iG H (C), where H is the group of K-points of
 the unipotent radical of the Iwahori subgroup of G((t)), and C is the trivial representation. In
 Sect. 4 we give a slight improvement of Kapranov’s main result by showing that the (modified)
 Cherednik’s algebra maps isomorphically onto the ring EndRep(G) (V).
    In addition, in Sect. 4 we discuss another series of examples of objects of Rep(G) by applying
 the functor iGH for H = G[[t]](K) and G[[t]](K)-representations, which are restrictions of irre-
 ducible cuspidal representations of the p-adic group G(K). By analogy with the corresponding
 result in the theory of p-adic groups, we conjecture that these objects are actually irreducible
 in Rep(G), and give some evidence in support of this conjecture.

0.4. Finally, in Sect. 5 we formulate and prove the main result of this paper.
   Suppose that the group G acts on an algebraic variety S. In the theory of p-adic groups one
introduces the Schwartz space Functlc
                                    c (S(K)) of locally constant compactly supported functions
on the set of K-points of S, which is a smooth representation of the group G(K).
   The question that we want to address is whether one can define an analogue of the Schwartz
space, denoted in this paper by M (S), which would be related to functions and/or distributions
on the set of F-valued points of S. Of course, one expects that M (S) is an object of Vect,
underlying a G(F)-representation.
   It appears that the answer to this question is negative in the simplest example of G =
SL2 acting on the projective line, and the situation seems to be analogous to the problem of
developing the theory of D-modules on loop spaces, cf. [1].
   However, there are two important examples of G-varieties S, for which we can define M (S):

   First, we consider the case of S being the affine space An , with the natural action of GLn .
We introduce a space M (An ) and show that it is naturally an object in the category of repre-
                         dn (here GL
sentations of the group GL           dn is the group of K-points of the canonical (i.e., Tate)
                               d
central extension 1 → Gm → GLn → GLn ((t)) → 1).
   Next, we consider the case when the variety S is isomorphic to the group G itself, with
the action by left translations, and we construct an object M (G) ∈ Rep(G). Now the natural
question to ask is, whether the action of G(F) on itself by right translations defines on M (G)
another, commuting, structure of an object of Rep(G).
   The answer to this question is that the right action of G(F) on M (G) develops an anomaly
(compare it with the main theorem from [1]). Namely, M (G) does carry a commuting action,
but of the group of K-points of the central extension 1 → Gm → G b → G((t)) → 1 corresponding
to the adjoint action of G on its Lie algebra.

                                        1. Preliminaries
1.1. We will work with inductive and projective limits of objects of various categories. Let I
be a set. Recall that I is said to be filtering if it is endowed with a partial order, such that for
any two elements i1 , i2 ∈ I, there exists an element i′ ∈ I with i′ ≥ i1 , i2 .
   Let I be a filtering set, which we can regard as a category, and Φ : i 7→ Si be a functor
I → Set. We will denote by lim Si the inductive limit of Φ. In other words,
                               −→
                            HomSet (lim Si , S) ≃ HomFunctors (Φ, ΦS ),
                                      −→
where Functors denotes the category of functors I → Set, and ΦS is the “constant” functor
corresponding to the set S.
   Let C be an arbitrary category. Recall from [7] that the ind-completion of C, denoted Ind(C),
is the full subcategory in the category of contravariant functors C → Set, which consists of
objects (isomorphic to ones) of the form
                                      X 7→ lim HomC (X, Xi ),
                                            −→
where i 7→ Xi is a functor I → C and I is a filtering set; we will denote by ”lim” Xi the
                                                                                         −→
corresponding object of Ind(C), which we will call “the direct limit of the system Xi ”. By
definition, ”lim” Xi (X) = lim Hom(X, Xi ), where the inductive limit is taken in the category
             −→              −→
of sets.
   For example, let V ect (resp., V ect0 ) be the category of vector spaces (resp., finite-dimensional
vector spaces) over a given ground field. We have V ect ≃ Ind(V ect0 ). (It is a good exercise to
show Ind(V ect) is NOT equivalent to V ect.)
   For a cardinal ℵ, we will denote by Indℵ (C) the full subcategory of Ind(C) obtained by
imposing the condition that the sets of indices that we are considering are of cardinality ≤ ℵ.
   We have a canonical fully faithful embedding C → Ind(C). The (partially defined) left adjoint
Ind(C) → C, called the inductive limit, which we will denote by limInd, is always right-exact.
4                            DAVID KAZHDAN AND DENNIS GAITSGORY


We will say that C is closed under inductive limits (resp., inductive limits of cardinality ≤ ℵ)
if the functor limInd is defined on the entire Ind(C) (resp., Indℵ (C)). For example, it is easy
to show that any category of the form Ind(C), (resp., Indℵ (C)), where C is another category, is
always closed under inductive limits (resp., of cardinality ≤ ℵ).
Note on the terminology: Let us emphasize that for a functor I → C : i 7→ Xi , we denote by
”lim” Xi the corresponding object of Ind(C), and call it the direct limit of the Xi ’s, following
    −→
[7]. By contrast, if the object limInd(”lim” Xi ) ∈ C exists, we will call it the inductive limit of
                                          −→
the Xi ’s, and denote it also by lim Xi .
                                 −→
    The following simple assertion is useful:
Lemma 1.2. Assume that C is closed under inductive limits of cardinality ≤ ℵ, and X ∈
Indℵ (C). Then X belongs to C if and only if for every ”lim”Xi′ =: X ′ ∈ Indℵ (C), the canonical
                                                      −→
arrow X lim Xi′ → lim (X(Xi′ )) ≃ HomInd(C) (X ′ , X) is an isomorphism.
            −→          ←−


   The pro-completion Pro(C) (resp., Proℵ (C)) and the functor limP roj : Pro(C) → C are
                                                                          o
defined in the same way by inverting the arrows, i.e., Pro(C) = (Ind(Co )) , where the superscript
“o” means the opposite category.
1.3. Suppose now that C is an additive (resp., C-linear) category. Then every object F of
Ind(C), which is a priori a contravariant functor C → Set, lifts in a natural way to an additive
functor C → {Abelian groups} (resp., C-linear functor C → V ect).
   Indeed if for some Xi ∈ C, X = ”lim” Xi , for the corresponding Hom sets we have: X(Y ) =
                                      −→
lim Hom(Y, Xi ), and this inductive limit of sets has a natural structure of an abelian group
−→
(resp., C-vector space).
   Suppose now that C is abelian. We will now give a simple criterion that establishes ind-
representability of functors in this case. Together with Lemma 1.2 this provides a tool to prove
representability of various functors in the framework of abelian categories.
   Assume that C is such that for a given object the class if its subobjects is a set. Let F :
C → {Abelian groups} be a contravariant left exact functor. Suppose that there exists another
functor F ′ and a morphism of functors F → F ′ such that ∀X ∈ C the map F (X) → F ′ (X) is
injective.
Proposition 1.4. Assume that for C, F and F ′ as above, the functor F ′ is ind-representable.
Then the functor F is also ind-representable.
Proof. (Compare [2], Corollary 2.8)
  Let Z = ”lim” Zi be the object of Ind(C) ind-representing F ′ . For each index i consider the
              −→
functor Fi equal to F × Hom(·, Zi ). Each Fi is also left exact and its map to Hom(·, Zi ) is an
                        F′
injection. Obviously, F (Y ) = lim Fi (Y ), so it enough to show that each Fi is ind-representable.
                                −→
In other words, we can assume that F ′ is representable by an object Z ∈ C.
   Consider the category of pairs (X ∈ C, α : X → Z), where α is an injective morphism
in C such that the corresponding element in F ′ (X) belongs to F (X). (Morphisms between
(X ∈ C, α : X → Z) and (X ′ ∈ C, α′ : X ′ → Z) are maps X → X ′ in C, which commute
with the data of α and α′ .) This category is obviously discrete, and it is small due to our
assumption on C. This resulting poset is filtering and is endowed with a functor to C, i.e.,
(X ∈ C, α : X → Z) 7→ X.

    Let W ∈ Ind(C) be the direct limit of this system. We claim that W ind-represents the
functor F . Indeed, for Y ∈ C, given an element in Hom(Y, W ) we have for some X an element
in F (X) and a map Y → X, which gives rise to an element of F (Y ).
    And vice versa, given an element in aY ∈ F (Y ) consider the corresponding element a′Y ∈
  ′
F (Y ) and the resulting map Y → Z. Let X be the image of this map:

                                         Y ։ X ֒→ Z.

It is enough to show that aY belongs to the image of F (X). Since F is left exact, it is enough
to show that the image of aY vanishes in F (ker(Y → X)). However, by assumption, the image
of a′Y in F ′ (ker(Y → X)) is zero, which implies our assertion, since F → F ′ is injective.
                                                                                              

  The following is also well-known (cf. [2], Proposition 4.5):

Lemma 1.5. If C is abelian, then so is Ind(C). The functor limInd : Ind(Ind(C)) → Ind(C) is
exact.

  Of course, assertions similar to the above ones hold when we replace Ind by Pro.

1.6. The following category will play an essential role in this paper:

                             Vect := Pro(V ect) ≃ Pro(Ind(V ect0 )).

According to Lemma 1.5, this is an abelian category.
  We will also consider the categories Set := Ind(Pro(Set0 )), and

                       Set := Ind(Pro(Set)) ≃ Ind(Pro(Ind(Pro(Set0 )))),

where Set0 is the category of finite sets.
  Note that the category Pro(Set0 ) is equivalent to the category of compact totally discon-
nected topological spaces; let us denote this equivalence by Y 7→ Ytop . If Y = ”lim” Yj , then
                                                                                    ←−
Ytop ≃ Y = lim Yj , where the projective limit is taken in the category of topological spaces.
              ←−
For X ∈ Set presented as a direct limit ”lim” Xi with Xi ∈ Pro(Set0 ), set Xtop to be the topo-
                                          −→
logical space lim Xtop
                   i   (where the inductive limit is again taken in the category of topological
              −→
spaces).
   We will use the following terminology. We will call an object X ∈ Set compact, if it belongs
to Pro(Set0 ), and a morphism X → Y in Set proper if every base change by a compact object
is compact.
   We will call an object X ∈ Set locally compact, if it can be represented as a direct limit
X = ”lim” Xi , Xi ∈ Pro(Set0 ), where the maps Xi → Xj are such that the corresponding
       −→
maps of topological spaces Xtop
                              i  → Xtopj  are open embeddings.
   The full subcategory of Set consisting of locally compact objects is equivalent to the category
T opHlctd of Hausdorff locally compact totally disconnected topological spaces. All objects of
Set that are relevant for the purposes of this paper will be locally compact. Therefore, the
reader may safely replace Set by T opHlctd and Set by Ind(Pro(T opHlctd )).

  Similarly, we will call an object X ∈ Set bounded if it actually belongs to Pro(Set).

1.7. Let A be a monoidal category, i.e., we have a functor ⊗ : A × A → A, a unit object
1A ∈ A and functorial isomorphisms
                   X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z) ≃ (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z; X ⊗ 1A ≃ X ≃ 1A ⊗ X,
obeying the usual axioms. Note that in this case the categories Ind(A) and Pro(A) also possess
natural monoidal structures.
   If C is another category, there is a standard notion of action of A on C, in which case we say
that C is a module category over A. Namely, a module structure is a functor ⊗ : A × C → C,
and for X, Y ∈ A and V ∈ C functorial isomorphisms
                         (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ V → X ⊗ (Y ⊗ V ); 1A ⊗ V ≃ V,
satisfying the natural axioms. In particular, for X ∈ A, V, W ∈ C we have a well-defined Hom
set Hom(X ⊗ V, W ).
   By definition, a pseudo-action of A on C (or a structure on C of a pseudo-module over A) is
a functor Ao × Co × C → Set, denoted Hom(· ⊗ ·, ·), and a morphism of functors: for X, Y ∈ A,
V, U, W ∈ C
               Hom(X ⊗ V, W ) × Hom(Y ⊗ U, V ) ⇒ Hom((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ U, W ),
and a functorial isomorphism Hom(1A ⊗ V, W ) ≃ HomC (V, W ), such that the following com-
patibility conditions hold:
For X, Y, Z ∈ A, V, U, W, Q ∈ C, the arrows
      Hom(X ⊗ W, Q) × Hom(Y ⊗ V, W ) × Hom(Z ⊗ U, V ) →
      → Hom(X ⊗ W, Q) × Hom((Y ⊗ Z) ⊗ U, W ) → Hom((X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)) ⊗ U, Q) and
      Hom(X ⊗ W, Q) × Hom(Y ⊗ V, W ) × Hom(Z ⊗ U, V ) →
      → Hom((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ V, Q) ⊗ Hom(Z ⊗ U, V ) → Hom(((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z) ⊗ U, Q)
coincide under the associativity isomorphism (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z ≃ X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z), and for U, V, W ∈ C
and X ∈ A, the squares
        Hom(X ⊗ V, U ) × HomC (W, V ) −−−−→ Hom(X ⊗ V, U ) × Hom(1A ⊗ W, V )
                                                          
                                                          
                    y                                      y
                Hom(X ⊗ W, U )            −−−−→          Hom((X ⊗ 1A ) ⊗ W, U )
and
        HomC (V, W ) × Hom(X ⊗ U, V ) −−−−→ Hom(1A ⊗ V, W ) × Hom(X ⊗ U, V )
                                                          
                                                          
                      y                                    y
                Hom(X ⊗ U, W )            −−−−→          Hom((1A ⊗ X) ⊗ U, W )
are commutative.
   Note that if C is a pseudo-module over A, then Co is a pseudo-module over Aop , where the
latter is the category A with the opposite monoidal structure:
                           Hom(X ⊗ V o , W o ) := Hom(X ⊗ W, V ).
  When C is additive (resp., C-linear), we will rather use the variant of the above definition,
when we require that the sets Hom(X ⊗ U, V ) have a structure of an abelian group (resp.,
C-vector space), such that the natural transformations Hom(X ⊗ U, V ) × Hom(Y ⊗ V, W ) ⇒
Hom((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ U, W ) and Hom(1A ⊗ V, W ) ≃ HomC (V, W ) are bilinear (resp., linear).
                 ALGEBRAIC GROUPS OVER A TWO-DIMENSIONAL LOCAL FIELD                            7


   For example, the category Set is a monoidal via X ⊗ Y := X × Y , and any category C has a
pseudo-module structure over Set via Hom(X ⊗ U, V ) := Hom(U, V )X for X ∈ Set, U, V ∈ C.
   Of course, when C is a module category over A, it acquires a pseudo-module structure by
setting
                             Hom(X ⊗ U, V ) := HomC (X ⊗ U, V ).
  In what follows we will say that an element φ ∈ Hom(X ⊗U, V ) defines an action X ×U → V .

1.8. Let us now analyze how pseudo-actions behave when we Ind- and Pro- complete our
categories.
   First, we claim that if A pseudo-acts on C, then so do Ind(A) and Pro(A). Indeed, if
X ∈ Ind(A) (resp., X ∈ Pro(A)) is ”lim” Xi (resp., ”lim” Xi ), we set Hom(X ⊗ V, W ) =
                                        −→                   ←−
lim Hom(Xi ⊗ V, W ) (resp., Hom(X ⊗ V, W ) = lim Hom(Xi ⊗ V, W )). It is easy to see that
←−                                                 −→
this definition is independent of the way we represent X as a direct (resp., inverse) limit.
   Also, if C has a pseudo-module structure over A, so do Ind(C) and Pro(C). Indeed, for V, W ∈
Ind(C) equal to ”lim” Vi and ”lim” Wj , (resp., ”lim” Vi and ”lim” Wj ), we set Hom(X ⊗ V, W )
                   −→          −→                ←−           ←−
to be
               (lim)(lim) Hom(X ⊗ Vi , Wj ) and (lim)(lim) Hom(X ⊗ Vi , Wj ),
                ←−   −→                             ←−   −→
                 i    j                              j    i

respectively. One can easily see that this definition is independent of the presentation of V and
W as directs (resp., inverse) limits.

   Now, we obtain that there are two pseudo-actions of Ind(A) on Ind(C). One is (which we
will call ”naive”) when we first consider the pseudo-action of Ind(A) on C and then produce
from it the corresponding pseudo-action on Ind(C). The other is when we first consider the
pseudo-action of A on Ind(C) and then produce from it the corresponding pseudo-action of
Ind(A). Unless specified otherwise, in the sequel we will use the pseudo-action of the second
kind. Note that we have a canonical map Hom(X ⊗V, W )naive → Hom(X ⊗V, W ). In concrete
terms, if X = ”lim” Xk , ”lim” Vi and ”lim” Wj , we have:
                −→         −→           −→

                 Hom(X ⊗ V, W )naive = (lim)(lim)(lim) Hom(Xk ⊗ Vi , Wj );
                                           ←−     −→    ←−
                                            i      j     k
                 Hom(X ⊗ V, W ) = (lim)(lim)(lim) Hom(Xk ⊗ Vi , Wj ).
                                      ←−     ←−   −→
                                       k      i    j


  For example, by taking C = A, the canonical action of Ind(A) on itself corresponding to the
monoidal structure coincides with the pseudo-action described above coming from the action
on A on itself.
  Similarly, we obtain the corresponding notions concerning the pseudo-action of Ind(A) on
Pro(C).

   The situation with the pseudo-actions of Pro(A) is the opposite. The naive pseudo-module
structure on Ind(C) is obtained when we first consider the pseudo-action of A on Ind(C), and
then produce from it a pseudo-action of Pro(A). The pseudo-module structure that we will
normally consider is is obtained by first considering the pseudo-action of Pro(A) on C, and then
producing from it the corresponding pseudo-action on Ind(C). As before, we have a canonical
map Hom(X ⊗ V, W )naive → Hom(X ⊗ V, W ), and for V = ”lim” Vi , W = ”lim” Wj and
                                                                   −→               −→
8                           DAVID KAZHDAN AND DENNIS GAITSGORY


X = ”lim” Xk
      ←−

                 Hom(X ⊗ V, W )naive = (lim)(lim)(lim) Hom(Xk ⊗ Vi , Wj );
                                            −→        ←−            −→
                                             k         i             j
                 Hom(X ⊗ V, W ) = (lim)(lim)(lim) Hom(Xk ⊗ Vi , Wj ).
                                      ←−    −→         −→
                                       i     j          k

   In a similar way, we obtain the two pseudo-actions of Pro(A) on Pro(C). As above, for C = A
this canonical pseudo-action coincides with the action corresponding to the monoidal structure
on Pro(A).

   Finally, we see that there are 3 possible pseudo-actions of Ind Pro(A) on Ind(C). The one
that we will consider is ”the biggest”: we will first consider the pseudo-action of Pro(A) on
C, then produce from it the pseudo-action of Pro(A) on Ind(C), and then the pseudo-action of
Ind Pro(A) on Ind(C).
   Explicitly, if X ∈ Ind Pro(A) is ”lim”(”lim” Xlk ), V = ”lim” Vi and W = ”lim” Wj , then
                                     −→     ←−                           −→     −→
                                      k          l

                   Hom(X ⊗ V, W ) = lim lim lim lim Hom(Xlk ⊗ Vi , Wj ).
                                          ←− ←− −→ −→
                                           k  i  l  j

  By inverting the arrows in C we obtain the corresponding pseudo-action of Ind Pro(A) on
Pro(C).

1.9. Let us consider our main examples. Let A = Set0 , and C = V ect0 . Then for X ∈ Set =
Ind(Pro(Set0 )), V, W ∈ V ect = Ind(V ect0 ), we obtain the notion of an action X × V → W.
However, it is easy to see that such an action is the same as a continuous map Xtop × V → W,
linear in V and W, where V and W are endowed with the discrete topology, and Xtop is as in
Sect. 1.6.

  Now set A = Set = Ind(Pro(Set0 )) and C = V ect. We obtain a pseudo-module structure on
Vect with respect to Set.
  Let us write down the last notion in more concrete terms. First, let X be an object of
Pro(Set), and V, W be two objects of Vect. An action φ : X × V → W is the following data. Let
X = ”lim” Xj , V = ”lim” Vi , W = ”lim” Wi′ , with Xj ∈ Set, Vi , Wi′ ∈ V ect. Then for every
      ←−             ←−              ←−
i′ there must exist i0 , j0 and a compatible system of action maps φj,i,i′ : Xj ×Vi → Wi′ defined
for i ≥ i0 , j ≥ j0 . Another compatibility condition is imposed: for i′1 ≥ i′2 the corresponding
diagrams
                                                     φj1 ,i1 ,i′
                                                  1
                                   Xj1 × Vi1 −−−−−→ Wi′1
                                                    
                                                    
                                       y             y
                                                     φj         ′
                                                  2     2 ,i2 ,i
                                   Xj2 × Vi2 −−−−−→ Wi′2
must commute for i1 and j1 large enough. Two action maps φ and ψ coincide if for every i′ the
corresponding maps φj,i,i′ and ψj,i,i′ coincide for i and j large enough.
   If now X is an object of Set, equal to ”lim” Xj and V, W ∈ Vect, an action φ : X × V → W
                                            −→
is a compatible system of actions φj : Xj × V → W.

1.10. The following definition will be needed in the sequel. First, note that we have an obvious
functor from the category of sets (denoted Set) to Set via
                           Set ≃ Ind(Set0 ) → Ind(Pro(Set0 )) ≃ Set.
Let X1 → X2 be a map of objects of Set. We will say that it is weakly surjective if for any
Y ∈ Set, the map
                               HomSet (X2 , Y ) → HomSet (X1 , Y )
is injective.
    Note that if X1 , X2 are locally compact, the above notion that a morphism X1 → X2 is
weakly surjective is equivalent to the condition that the corresponding map Xtop
                                                                             1   → Xtop
                                                                                    2   has
dense image.
Lemma 1.11. A map X1 → X2 in Set is weakly surjective if and only if for any V, W ∈ V ect,
the map Hom(X2 ⊗ V, W) → Hom(X1 ⊗ V, W) is injective.
   We will call an object X ∈ Pro(Set) weakly strict if it can be represented as ”lim” Xi , where
                                                                                  ←−
the maps Xj → Xi are weakly surjective.
   Note that if X is weakly strict and V, W ∈ V ect, for any element φ ∈ Hom(X ⊗ V, W)
we have well-defined kernel and image of φ. By definition, ker(φ) ⊂ V (resp., Im(φ) ⊂ W) is
the maximal (resp., minimal) subspace V′ of V (resp., W′ of W) having the property that φ
factors through an element φ′ ∈ Hom(X ⊗ V/V′ , W′ ) (resp., φ′ ∈ Hom(X ⊗ V, W′ )).
   Indeed, both ker(φ) and Im(φ) are clearly well-defined when X ∈ Set. If now X = ”lim” Xi ,
                                                                                        ←−
with weakly surjective maps, and φ comes from an element φi ∈ Hom(Xi ⊗ V, W), then it is
easy to see that ker(φi ) ⊂ V and Im(φi ) ⊂ W are the sought-for subspaces.

                            2. Categories of representations
2.1. In the abstract set-up of the previous section, let us recall that an object X ∈ A is called
a monoid (in the sense of the monoidal structure on A) if we are given a (multiplication) map
X ⊗ X → X and a (unit) map 1A → X, which satisfy the usual associativity and unit axioms.
   In our examples, the monoidal structure on A will be such that X ⊗ Y is isomorphic to the
categorical direct product X × Y . Moreover, HomC (X, 1A ) will be a one-element set ∀X ∈ C.
Note that this property is inherited by both Ind(A) and Pro(A).
    In this case, it makes sense to speak about group-objects in A: a monoid X is called a group
if there exists a map γ : X → X (automatically unique) such that the two compositions
                                ∆         id ×γ        mult
                             X → X × X −→ X × X −→ X and
                                    ∆        γ×id         mult
                                X → X × X −→ X × X −→ X
are both equal to X → 1A → X.
   In the sequel we will only consider monoids, which are groups.
2.2. If C is another category with a pseudo-action of A and X ∈ A is a monoid, a representation
of X in C is a pair Π = (V, ρ), where V ∈ C and ρ ∈ Hom(X ⊗ V, V ), such that the following
two conditions hold:
Associativity: The image of ρ × ρ under the associativity constraint
                Hom(X ⊗ V, V ) ⊗ Hom(X ⊗ V, V ) → Hom((X ⊗ X) ⊗ V, V )
equals the image of ρ under the map Hom(X ⊗ V, V ) → Hom(X ⊗ X) ⊗ V, V ) given by the
multiplication X ⊗ X → X.
10                             DAVID KAZHDAN AND DENNIS GAITSGORY


Unit: The image of ρ in Hom(1A ⊗ V, V ) under 1A → X equals the identity element in
Hom(1A ⊗ V, V ) ≃ Hom(V, V ).
  Representations of X in C form a category, which we will denote by Rep(X, C). When C is
additive (resp., C-linear), the category Rep(X, C) is additive (resp., C-linear) as well.
  Assume now that C is abelian and that for a fixed X ∈ A, the functor Co × C → Set given
by V, W 7→ Hom(X ⊗ V, W ) is left-exact in both arguments.
Lemma 2.3. Under the above circumstances the category Rep(X, C) is abelian and the natural
forgetful functor Rep(X, C) → C is exact.
   If A is a monoidal category with a pseudo-action on an abelian category C, such that the above
left-exactness condition is satisfied, then the same holds for Ind(A) (resp., Pro(A)) pseudo-
acting on Ind(C) (resp., Pro(C)), due to the fact that the functor limInd (resp., limP roj) is
exact (resp., left-exact) on the category of abelian groups.
   In particular, we obtain that this condition is satisfied in our examples of A = Set, C = V ect
and A = Set, C = Vect.

2.4. Set first A = Set, and C = V ect. Thus, for a group-object H ∈ Set the category
Rep(H, V ect) is the usual category of representations of H appearing in the theory of p-adic
groups. In other words, if H is locally compact (cf. Sect. 1.6) and Htop is the corresponding
topological group, then an object of Rep(H, V ect) is the same as a smooth representation of
Htop .
   If H is a group-object of Pro(Set), we can consider its representations on V ect and Vect, and
the resulting categories will be denoted by Rep(H, V ect) and Rep(H, Vect), respectively.
  We will say that H ∈ Pro(Set) satisfies condition (∗) if it is weakly strict as an object of
Pro(Set), cf. Sect. 1.10.
  The following assertion will play an important role in the sequel: 1
Proposition 2.5. For H satisfying (∗), the categories Rep(H, Vect) and Pro(Rep(H, V ect))
are naturally equivalent.
   Note that the proof given below is valid when H is a just a monoid (not necessarily a group),
satisfying condition (∗).

Proof. The functor in one direction: F : Pro Rep(H, V ect)) → Rep(H, Vect) is evident; more-
over, it is easy to see that it is fully faithful. Let us show that it admits a left adjoint.
  For (V, ρ) ∈ Rep(H, Vect), let us write V = ”lim” Vi , where the index i runs over some
                                                         ←−
filtering set I. Consider the category of quadruples (V′ , ρ′ , i, α : Vi → V′ ), where (V′ , ρ′ ) ∈
Rep(H, V ect), i ∈ I and α is a map, such that its image generates V′ as an H-representation
and the composition V → Vi → V′ is compatible with the H-actions. A morphism between
(V1 , ρ′1 , i1 , α1 : Vi1 → V1′ ) and (V2 , ρ′2 , i2 , α2 : Vi2 → V2′ ) is by definition a relation i2 ≥ i1
and a map of H-representations V1′ → V2′ , such that the square
                                            Vi1 −−−−→ Vi2

commutes. The resulting category is evidently discrete, filtering and small. By definition, we
have a forgetful functor from this category to Rep(H, V ect) that sends a quadruple (V′ , ρ′ , i, α)
to (V′ , ρ′ ). Let us denote by G(V, ρ) ∈ Pro(Rep(H, V ect)) the resulting inverse limit. It is easy
too see that the assignment (V, ρ) 7→ G(V, ρ) defines a functor left adjoint to F.
   The fact that F was fully-faifull means that the composition G ◦ F is isomorphic to the
identity functor. Thus, it remains to see that for (V, ρ) ∈ Rep(H, Vect), the adjunction map
(V, ρ) → F ◦ G(V, ρ) is an isomorphism. For that, it suffices to show that if V = ”lim” Vi , then
                                                                                       ←−
for every i there exists a vector space Vi′ underlying an object Π = (Vi′ , ρi ) ∈ Rep(H, V ect),
such that the map V → Vi factors as V → Vi′ → Vi , with the first arrow preserving the
H-action. Indeed, this would show that the map (V, ρ) → F ◦ G(V, ρ) is always injective, and
combined with the fact that G is right-exact, this implies that this map is an isomorphism.

H × Vk −→ Vj . The above kernel and image are well-defined due to the (∗) assumption on
H, cf. Sect. 1.10.

claim that there exists a unique map H × Vi′ → Vi′ , which makes the diagram

   Let n1 ≥ n0 be an index such that the multiplication on H gives rise to a map multnn01 ,n1 :
Xn1 × Xn1 → Xn0 , and let n2 ≥ n1 be another index, such that we have a multiplication
multnn12 ,n2 : Xn2 × Xn2 → Xn1 , satisfying an obvious associativity with respect to multnn01 ,n1 .

   For H as above we have a natural embedding triv : Vect → Rep(H, Vect), corresponding to
“trivial” representations.
Corollary 2.6. For H satisfying (∗), the functor triv admits both right and left adjoints.
     Note that in Proposition 2.10 a more general statement is established.
Proof. First, from Sect. 1.10 it follows the the functor triv : V ect → Rep(H, V ect) admits right
and left adjoints, denoted Π 7→ ΠH and Π 7→ ΠH , respectively.
   Therefore, using Proposition 2.5, it is enough to show that the functor triv : Pro(V ect) →
Pro(Rep(H, V ect)) has left and right adjoints. But these are simply given by sending Π =
”lim” Πi to ΠH ≃ ”lim” (Πi )H and ΠH ≃ ”lim” (Πi )H , respectively.

   As every right adjoint, the functor Π 7→ ΠH is left-exact, and similarly, the functor Π 7→ ΠH
is right-exact.
Lemma 2.7. Assume that H is the inverse limit of a weakly surjective family of Hi , where
each Hi is a group-object in Set isomorphic to a direct limit of Hi,j , with each Hi,j being a
group-object of Pro(Set0 ). Then the functor of coinvariants Rep(H, Vect) → Vect is exact.
Proof. According to Proposition 2.5 and Corollary 2.6, each Π ∈ Rep(H, Vect) is an inverse
limit of Πk ∈ Rep(H, V ect), and ΠH ≃ ”lim”(Πk )H . Therefore, it suffices to show that the
                                                       ←−
functor of coinvariants is exact on Rep(H, V ect). By the definition of the latter, we can replace
H by one of its quotients Hi , which we will denote by H.
   However, the fact that functor Π 7→ ΠH is exact on the category Rep(H, V ect) is well-known.
Indeed, if H = ”lim”Hj , Hj ∈ Pro(Set0 ),
                  −→

                                                   ΠH ≃ lim ΠHj ,

                                                             j

but the functor limInd is exact on V ect, and the functor Π → ΠHj is exact on Rep(Hj , V ect),
since Htop
       j   is a compact group.
                                                                                            
2.8. Consider now the category Set with its pseudo-action on Vect. The main object of study
of this paper is the category of representations Rep(G, Vect) of a group-object G ∈ Set in Vect.
For brevity, we will denote the category by Rep(G), when no confusion is likely to occur.
Lemma 2.9. The functor limP roj : Pro(Rep(G)) → Rep(G) is defined on the entire category
and is exact.

Proof. Recall (cf. Lemma 1.5, with Ind replaced by Pro) that the category Vect is closed under
projective limits. If Πi = (Vi , ρi ) is an inverse system of objects of Rep(G), we define V ∈ Vect
as lim Vi . It is easy to see from the definitions that there exists an action ρ : G × V → V, such
   ←−
that (V, ρ) represents the projective limit lim Πi . The exactness follows from the fact that the

functor limP roj : Pro(Vect) → Vect is exact.
                                                                                                 
   We will say that H ∈ Set satisfies condition (∗∗) if, as an object of Ind(Pro(Set)), H can be
represented as ”lim” Xk , with Xk ∈ Pro(Set) being weakly strict.
                 −→

   As before, we have an obvious functor triv : Vect → Rep(H) corresponding to “trivial”
representations.
Proposition 2.10. The functor triv : Vect → Rep(H) admits a left adjoint, and when H
satisfies (∗∗), also a right adjoint.
Proof. Let us first construct the left adjoint of triv. Consider the covariant functor on the cat-
egory V ect that sends a vector space V to HomRep(H) (Π, triv(V)). This functor is a subfunctor
of V 7→ HomVect (Π, V). Hence, by Proposition 1.4, it is pro-representable.
   Let us denote the resulting object of Vect by ΠH . It is strightforward to check that for
V ∈ Vect, we have a functorial isomorphism HomRep(H) (Π, triv(V)) ≃ HomVect (ΠH , V).
  Now let us construct the right adjoint to triv. Let us write H ∈ Set as ”lim” Xk , where
                                                                                   −→
Xk ∈ Pro(Set) are weakly strict.
  For a weakly strict object X ∈ Pro(Set), V, U ∈ Vect, and an action map φ : X × V → U,
consider the kernel of φ as a functor on Vect:
                             ker(φ)(W) = {ψ : W → V | φ ◦ ψ = 0}.
We claim that this functor is representable. If this is so, it is easy to see that the sought-for
right adjoint of triv is representable by
                           (V, ρ)H = lim ker (p − act : Xk × V → V) ,
                                      ←−
                                       k

where lim is taken in the category Vect, and p is the obvious projection map Xk × V → V.
      ←−
  To show the representability, we can assume that U = U ∈ V ect. Indeed, if U = ”lim” Ui ,
                                                                                          ←−
then Ker(φ) = lim ker (X × V → Ui ). In the latter case, we can assume that V = ”lim” Vj ,
                ←−                                                                        ←−
                 i
and we have a compatible system of maps φj : X × Vj → U. By Sect. 1.10, ker(φj ) ⊂ Vj is
well-defined, and it is easy to see that ”lim” ker(φj ) ∈ Vect represents ker(φ).
                                          ←−
                                                                                      
   The main source of examples of such G, i.e., of group-objects in Set, is provided by considering
sets of points of algebraic groups with values in a two-dimensional local field.

2.11. Let K be a local field, with the corresponding local ring OK . We will denote by π a
uniformizer of K. Set F = K((t)), OF = K[[t]].
   Let Schf t denote the category of separated schemes of finite type over K. If S is an object of
Schf t , we will denote by S(K) the corresponding set of K-points. It is well-known that S(K)
carries a natural locally compact totally disconnected topology; therefore, as a topological space,
S(K) ≃ Stop for a canonically defined locally compact object S ∈ Set.
14                           DAVID KAZHDAN AND DENNIS GAITSGORY


   Hence, we obtain a functor S 7→ S : Schf t → Set, and also the functors Pro(Schf t ) →
Pro(Set), and Ind(Pro(Schf t )) → Set.
   In particular, any affine scheme (not necessarily of finite type) over K defines an object of
Pro(Schf t ), and hence, an object of Pro(Set). In addition, for any scheme of finite type S, the
corresponding scheme of arcs S[[t]] is naturally an object of Pro(Schf t ):
                                       S[[t]] ≃ ”lim” S[t]/ti .
                                                  ←−

We will denote the corresponding object of Pro(Set) by S[[t]].
   If S is smooth, the maps in this family defining S[[t]] are fibrations into affine spaces; therefore
the corresponding maps S[t]/tj → S[t]/ti are weakly surjective. Hence, if S is smooth, the object
S[[t]] ∈ Pro(Set) is weakly strict.
   For a scheme S ′ over F, we define its ”restriction of scalars” from F to K as a functor on
the category of schemes over K by S 7→ HomF (S ⊗ F, S ′ ). If S ′ is of finite type and affine, then
                                                     K
by embedding it into an affine space one shows that the above functor is ind-representable by
an ind-scheme, which is a direct limit of affine schemes under closed embeddings. By taking
S ′ = S ⊗ F for S an affine scheme of finite type over K, we obtain an object of Ind(Pro(Schf t ))
       K
that will be denoted by S((t)). The resulting object of Set will be denoted by S((t)) or S.
   By applying the functor of iterated inductive and projective limits Set → Set, we obtain
from S (resp., S[[t]]) the set, which is tautologically identified with the set S(F) of F-points of
S (resp., S(OF )–the set of OF -points of S).
2.12. If G is a smooth linear algebraic group over K, by applying the functor G 7→ G we
obtain the corresponding group-object in Set. In particular, we can consider the category
of representations Rep(G, V ect), which is tautologically equivalent to the category of smooth
representations of the locally compact group G(K).
   For a non-negative integer i, let us denote by Gi the congruence subgroup of G[[t]], i.e., the
kernel of G[[t]] → G[[t]]/ti ; in particular, G0 = G[[t]]. Let Gi be the corresponding object of
Pro(Set). A subgroup H of G[[t]] will be called thick if it contains Gi for some i and equals
the preimage of a closed subgroup of G[[t]]/Gi (we are slightly abusing the terminology by
identifying G[[t]]/Gi with the corresponding locally compact group).
   For a thick H ⊂ G[[t]] we can consider the corresponding categories Rep(H, V ect) and
Rep(H, Vect). As was remarked above, G[[t]] ∈ Pro(Set) is weakly strict, and so are the
groups Gi . From this it is easy to see that any thick subgroup H ⊂ G[[t]] satisfies condition
(∗) of Sect. 2.4.
   Finally, for an algebraic group G as above, we can consider G (sometimes also denoted
G((t))), which is a group-object in Set and the corresponding category Rep(G, Vect), which we
will denote for brevity by Rep(G).
   It is well-known that the ind-scheme G((t)) can be represented as a direct limit under closed
embeddings of subschemes, each of which is stable under (both left and right) multiplication by
G[[t]], and is a principal G[[t]]-bundle over a scheme of finite type. (In fact, the above family of
subschemes is obtained by taking the preimages of finite-dimensional subschemes of the affine
Grassmannian of G, i.e., GrG = G((t))/G[[t]].) This implies, in particular, that G satisfies
condition (∗∗), cf. Sect. 2.8.
  Let us denote by VectG(F) the category consisting of objects of Vect with an action of the
abstract group G(F).

Proof. We have to show that if (V1 , ρ1 ) and (V2 , ρ2 ) are two objects of Rep(G), and V1 → V2
is a map preserving the action of G(F), then it is compatible with the G-action.
   This can be shown in the following general set-up: Let V1 , V2 , W1 , W2 be vector spaces,
and let X be an object of Pro(Set) endowed with action maps X × Vk → Wk , k = 1, 2. Let
V1 → V2 , W1 → W2 be maps, such that the square
                                 Xtop × V1 −−−−→ Xtop × V2
                                                    
                                                    
                                     y               y
                                    W1      −−−−→       W2
                     top
commutes, where X        is the topological space obtained from the corresponding object of
Pro(T opHlctd ) by taking the projective limit.
  Assume now that X can be presented as ”lim” Xi , where the maps Xj → Xi are such that
                                              ←−
the corresponding maps Xtop
                        j   → Xtop
                               i   are surjective. Then it is easy to see that the square
                                    X × V1 −−−−→ X × V2
                                                  
                                                  
                                      y            y
                                      W1    −−−−→      W2
commutes as well.
  The above assumption is satisfied in our situation for X being the object of Pro(Set) corre-
sponding to a subscheme of G((t)), obtained as a preimage of a closed subscheme in G((t))/G[[t]].
The required surjectivity follows from the fact that the groups Gi for i > 0 are pro-unipotent.
                                                                                              

2.14. Central extensions. Suppose now that G     b is a group-indscheme, which is a central
extension of G((t)) by the multiplicative group Gm , i.e.,
                                          b → G((t)) → 1.
                                 1 → Gm → G
                b is a group-object in the category of ind-schemes, such that if G((t)) =
In other words, G
                                                              b × Xk is a total space of a
”lim” Xk , and Xk = ”lim” Xk,l with Xk,l ∈ Schf t , then each G
 −→                    ←−                                         G((t))
Gm -torsor over Xk , and this torsor is pulled back from Xk,l for some index l. In what follows
we will assume that we have a splitting G[[t]] → G.b
                      b
   We will denote by G the corresponding group-object in Set, which is an extension of G by
Gm .
   Let c be a character Gm (K) → C∗ . We will denote by Repc (G)   b the category of represen-
           b
tations of G with central character c. In other words, the objects of this category are pairs
Π = (V, ρ), where V ∈ Vect, and ρ is an action map G    b × V → V, satisfying the associativity
and the unit axioms as above, and such that the composite action
                                             b ×V→V
                                    Gm × V → G
(where Gm is viewed as an object of Set ⊂ Set) corresponds to the above character.

2.15. We propose the category Rep(G) = Rep(G, Vect) as a framework for the study of rep-
resentations of the group G(F). Let us explain why introducing pro-objects of V ect appears to
be necessary. For the remainder of this section, let us assume that G is semi-simple, simply-
connected and split.
16                           DAVID KAZHDAN AND DENNIS GAITSGORY


   The first question to ask is whether the category Rep(G) contains any objects Π = (V, ρ),
where V belongs to V ect. The answer is that such representations are necessarily trivial (i.e.,
                                                      triv
they lie in the image of the functor V ect → Vect → Rep(G)), for the same reason as why
p-adic groups usually have no finite-dimensional representations.
   Indeed, suppose that (V, ρ) is such a representation. By Lemma 2.13, it is sufficient to prove
that the corresponding representation of the abstract group G(F) on V is trivial.
   Consider the kernel K of the action G(F) × V → V. This is a normal subgroup, and by
definition, there exists an i such that K ⊃ Gi (K). But then we claim that K must coincide
with G(F). Let N be the maximal unipotent subgroup of G, and let N i (K) := N (F) ∩ Gi (K)
be the corresponding congruence subgroup. Then N i (K) ⊂ K, but using the torus action and
the normality of K, we obtain that the entire N (F) is contained in K. Again, by normality,
we obtain that all unipotent elements in G(F) are contained in K. However, it is known that
for a split simply-connected group, its set of field-valued points is generated by the subset of
unipotent elements.

  Another sense in which one may seek an alternative definition of G(F)-representations is to
consider the pseudo-action of Set on Ind(V ect) = Ind(Ind(V ect0 )). We claim that (under the
same assumption on G) all objects of Rep(G, Ind(V ect)) are again trivial.

Proof. As before, we have a fully faithful functor Rep(G, Ind(V ect)) → Ind(V ect)G(F) , and it
suffices to show that for any object (V, ρ), V ∈ Ind(V ect), the action of the maximal unipotent
group N (F) on V is trivial. Obviously, we can replace G by an SL2 corresponding to some
simple root; let B ⊂ G be the corresponding Borel subgroup, i.e., N ≃ Ga , and B := Ga ⋉ Gm ,
where Gm acts on Ga by the square of the standard character.
   Our V is a direct limit ”lim”Vl , with Vl ∈ V ect. Fix an index l, and it suffices to show
                               −→
that the action map B(F) × Vl → V is trivial.
   For a (not necessarily positive) integer i, let us denote by N i (K) the subgroup of N (F) ≃
K((t)) equal to ti · K[[t]]. If the action of N (F) on Vl is non-trivial, let i be the minimal integer
such that the restriction of this action to N i (K) is trivial. By assumption we have a non-trivial
action map (N i−1 (K)/N i (K) ≃ K) × Vl → V.
   Let now j be a sufficiently large integer, so that the corresponding congruence subgroup
                                                                                                 ′
(Gm )j (K) acts trivially on Vl . Take i′ = (i − 1) − 2j and consider now the action of N i (K)
             ′
on Vl . Let l be a sufficiently large index such that the iteration of actions
                        ′                           ′
                     N i (K) × (Gm )j (K) × N i (K) × (Gm )j (K) × Vl → Vl′

is well-defined. We will show that the action N i−1 (K)/N i (K) × Vl → Vl′ is necessarily trivial,
which would be a contradiction. For that, it suffices to show that it is trivial on every element
                                                                              ′                    ′
v ∈ Vl . For every such v there exists an integer k such that the action of ti ·π k ·OK [[t]] ⊂ N i (K)
                                     j                i′  k
on v is trivial. Hence, for g ∈ (Gm ) (K) and n ∈ t · π · OK [[t]]

                                    (n · g · n−1 · g −1 ) · v = v ∈ Vl′ .

However, since (Gm )j (K) = 1 + tj · K[[t]], the subset of N (K) consisting of elements of the form
(n · g · n−1 · g −1 ), with g and n as above, equals the entire ti · K[[t]], in particular, it projects
surjectively onto N i−1 (K)/N i (K). Therefore, for n′ ∈ N i−1 (K), we have n′ · v = v ∈ Vl′ ,
which is what we had to show.
                                                                                                     

                                  3. The induction functor
3.1. Let G be a split reductive group over K, and let H be a thick subgroup of G[[t]]. We
                                        G
have an obvious restriction functor rH     : Rep(G) → Rep(H, Vect).
   Our goal in this section is define the functors eiG       G                                    eG
                                                        H , iH : Rep(H, Vect) → Rep(G), such that iH
                               G
will be the right adjoint of rH .
   We will have an injective functorial map iG                  eG
                                                    H (Π) → iH (Π), and there is a certain analogy
between the functors eiG          G
                         H and iH and the functors of induction and compact induction in the
theory of p-adic groups. When H corresponds to a parahoric subgroup of G[[t]], we will have
an isomorphism iG       eG
                  H ≃ iH .
   The construction of the functor iG  H makes sense for any algebraic group G, but the construc-
tion of the functor eiG
                      H  given  below  uses  the fact that G is reductive. However, we expect that
                       G
the right adjoint to rH   exists for any G.

3.2. To an object X ∈ Pro(Set0 ) we can attach the vector space of locally constant C-valued
functions, denoted Functlc (X). Namely, if X = ”lim” Xi ,
                                                     ←−
                                           lc
                                  Funct (X) = lim Funct(Xi ),
                                                 −→

where the direct system is taken with respect to the pull-back maps between the spaces of
functions. Of course, Functlc (X) identifies with the space of locally constant functions on the
topological space Xtop .
   For any X ∈ Set we define Functlc (X) ∈ Vect by setting for ”lim” Xj , Xj ∈ Pro(Set0 )
                                                                    −→
                                      lc                    lc
                                Funct (X) = ”lim” Funct (Xj ),
                                                ←−

with respect to the restriction maps. We define the space Functlc (X) ∈ V ect of locally constant
functions on X as limP roj(Functlc (X)).
   If X ∈ Set is locally compact (cf. Sect. 1.6), we can introduce the vector space Functlc  c (X),
which can be called the space of locally constant functions with compact support. One way
to introduce it is as the space of locally-constant compactly supported functions on Xtop .
Equivalently, if X is represented as a direct limit as in Sect. 1.6, we have the natural “extension
by zero” maps Functlc (Xi ) → Functlc (Xj ), and we set Functlc                       lc
                                                                   c (X) = lim Funct (Xi ). Note
                                                                           −→
that we always have an inclusion Functlc            lc
                                      c (X) ֒→ Funct (X).
   Let X be again locally compact, presented as a direct limit as in Sect. 1.6. If X′ → X is
map between objects of Set, we define the vector space Functlc        ′
                                                              c,rel (X ) as the inductive limit
          lc
lim Funct (X′ × Xi ).
−→              X

   If X → Y is a map in Set, we have the pull-back morphism Functlc (Y) → Functlc (X), and if
this is a proper map between locally compact objects, we also have the morphism Functlcc (Y) →
Functlcc (X).
   Suppose now that Y1 , Y2 ∈ Set are locally compact, and we have an action X × Y1 → Y2
(in the sense of the canonical tensor structure on Set), such that the map X × Y1 → X × Y2
is proper. Then we obtain an action map X × Functlc       2           lc  1
                                                     c (Y ) → Functc (Y ) (in the sense of the
pseudo-action of Set on V ect).
   For example, the above properness condition is always satisfied if X is a group-object acting
on Y1 = Y2 .
   Note that the above action does not always extend onto Functlc (Y).

   Let now Y be an object of Ind(Set). We will say that Y is “tame” if it can be represented
as ”lim” Yi such that Yi ∈ Set are locally compact, and the corresponding maps Yi → Yj
      −→
are proper. If Y is “tame”, we can attach to it the object Functlc                   lc
                                                                c (Y) ∈ Vect as Functc (Y) =
            lc
”lim” Functc (Yi ), where the maps are again given by restriction.
 ←−
     Suppose now that Y1 , Y2 ∈ Ind(Set) are both “tame”, Yij = ”lim” Yij for j = 1, 2, and let
                                                                           −→
X × Y1 → Y2 be an action of X ∈ Set in the sense of the pseudo-action of Set on Ind(Set).
That is X = ”lim” Xl , Xl = ”lim” Xl,k and the action is given by the maps Xl,k × Yi1 → Yi2′ .
                −→             ←−
We say that this action is proper if the above presentations can be chosen so that the maps
Xl,k × Yi1 → Xl,k × Yi2′ are proper. (This condition is satisfied if H is a group-object in Set
acting on Y = Y1 = Y2 .)
   If the action X×Y1 → Y2 is proper we obtain an action map X×Functlc                   lc
                                                                         c (Y2 ) → Functc (Y1 )
in the sense of the canonical pseudo-action of Set on Vect.

   A little more generally, if V is a vector space, instead of complex-valued functions, we
can consider spaces of functions with values in V, denoted Functlc (X, V) and Functlc
                                                                                   c (X, V),
respectively.


3.3. Let i ≥ 0 be such that Gi ⊂ H. Consider the full subcategory of Rep(H/Gi , V ect) ⊂
Rep(H, Vect); we will first define the restrictions of the functors iG  eG
                                                                     H , iH to this subcategory.
   Recall that there exists a strict ind-scheme of ind-finite-type G((t))/Gi (”strict” means that
it can be presented as a direct limit of schemes with transition maps being closed embedding).
Its existence, i.e., the ind-representability of the corresponding functor, follows easily from the
corresponding fact for GrG = G((t))/G[[t]] (see, for example, the Appendix to [5]). As an object
of Ind(Schf t ) it carries an action of G((t)) ∈ Ind(Pro(Schf t )) “on the left” and a commuting
action of G([[t]]/ti ) ∈ Schf t “on the right”.
   Therefore, by applying the functor S 7→ S : Schf t → Set, we obtain a “tame” object, denoted
G/Gi in Ind(Set), which carries the actions of G and G[[t]]/Gi .
   For an object Π = (V, ρ) ∈ Rep(H/Gi , V ect), we obtain that Functlc                 i
                                                                            c (G((t))/G , V) ∈ Vect
                                                       i
carries a natural G-action and a commuting H/G -action.
   The object of Vect underlying iG   H (Π) is set to be
                                                           
(2)                               Functlc    i            i
                                       c (G/G , V) ⊗ µ(H/G )           ,
                                                                H/Gi


where µ(H/Gi ) is the 1-dimensional vector space of left-invariant measures on the locally
compact group (H/Gi )top (acted on naturally by H/Gi , being a subspace of all measures
on (H/Gi )top ). The G-action on Functlc    i                 G
                                      c (G/G , V) defines on iH (Π) a structure of an object of
Rep(G).
  This definition of iG
                      H (Π) can be rewritten as follows. First, let us introduce the object
G/H ∈ Ind(Set). Let us write G((t))/G[[t]] as ”lim” Sk , Sk ∈ Schf t , and let Ski be the
                                                      −→
preimage of Sk in G((t))/Gi . Let Sk , Sik be the corresponding objects of Set. By construction
Sik carries an action of the groups H ⊂ G[[t]]/Gi , and we claim that the categorical quotient
          i        i
SHk := (Sk )/(H/G ) ∈ Set is well-defined and is locally compact. This follows for example from
                i

where the isomorphism is given by integration along the fibers of Sik → SH
                                                                         k.

   The above isomorphism makes it clear that iG  H (Π), as an object of Rep(G), is independent
of the choice of the congruence subgroup Gi contained in H. In particular, we obtain a well-
defined functor iG                                                    G
                  H : Rep(H, V ect) → Rep(G). From (2) we infer that iH is right-exact, and from
(3) that it is also left-exact.
   Using Proposition 2.5 we extend the above functor Rep(H, V ect) → Rep(G) to a functor
Rep(H, Vect) ≃ Pro(Rep(H, V ect)) → Pro(Rep(G)), which is also exact. We extend it further
to an exact functor iG  H : Rep(H, Vect) → Rep(G), using Lemma 2.9.

  It is easy to see that our functor iG                                                    G
                                      H is isomorphic to the composition of two functors: iG[[t]] :
                                    G[[t]]
Rep(G[[t]], Vect) → Rep(G) and iH        : Rep(H, Vect) → Rep(G[[t]], Vect), where the latter
functor is defined by a similar induction procedure.

3.4. Let us now define the functor eiG  H : Rep(H, Vect) → Rep(G). First, let us assume that H is
such that G/H ∈ Ind(Set) is ind-compact, i.e., is a direct limit of compact objects of Set. (E.g.,
this condition is verified for G[[t]], or more generally for any H containing I, where I ⊂ G[[t]]
is the Iwahori subgroup. This follows from the fact that the affine flag variety G((t))/I is
ind-proper, i.e., is a direct limit of proper schemes of finite type.)
   In this case we set eiG     G
                         H = iH .

Proposition 3.5. If G/H is ind-compact, the functor iG
                                                     H is the right adjoint to the restriction
         G
functor rH .
Proof. The proof mimics the proof of the usual adjunction property for p-adic groups.
                                              G
   Let us first construct the adjunction map rH ◦ iG                                         G
                                                   H → idRep(H,Vect) . By the definition of iH , it
                                      G   G                                    i
is enough to construct a morphism rH ◦ iH (Π) → Π for an object of Rep(H/G , V ect) for some
i.
   For Π = (V, ρ) ∈ Rep(H/Gi , V ect), consider the canonical restriction map

                Functlc    i            i         lc    i            i
                     c (G/G , V) ⊗ µ(H/G ) → Functc (H/G , V) ⊗ µ(H/G ),

which is bi-H/Gi -equivariant by construction.
   Since Functlc      i           i                                   i top
               c (H/G ) ⊗ µ(H/G ) identifies as a bi-module over (H/G )     with the Hecke
algebra of (compactly supported, locally constant) measures on this group, we obtain a bi-
H/Gi -equivariant map Functlc       i             i                  i
                             c (H/G , V) ⊗ µ(H/G ) → V. By the H/G -equivariance on the
right, we thus obtain a map Functlc        i           i
                                    c (G/G , V) ⊗ µ(H/G )      → V, as required.
                                                               H/Gi

   Let us now construct the second adjunction map (W, ρ′ ) → iG        G     ′           ′
                                                                 H ◦ rH (W, ρ ) for (W, ρ ) ∈

each Wi is a vector space underlying an object of Rep(H/Gni , V ect) for some ni . Let G/H =

   For every fixed k and i, let an index j be such that the G-action on W gives a map actj,i :
 n
Sk j × Wj → Wi . By further enlarging j, we may assume that this map is compatible with the
H-action.                                                    

                                                                  H/G   i

action map gives rise to a map

                                  Wj → Functlc (Sk j , Wi )       .

     Now, from the fact that SH  k is compact and isomorphism (3), we obtain
                                   H/Gnj                                
                          n
                Functlc (Sk j , Wi )       ≃ Functlc    ni              ni
                                                    c (Sk , Wi ) ⊗ µ(H/G )                .
                                                                                  H/Gni

By composing, we obtain the required morphism.
   It is easy to check that the constructed map from W to the object of Vect underlying
iG    G
 H rH (W) respects the G-action. It is equally straightforward to see that the two adjunction
   ◦
maps indeed give rise to the adjointness of functors.
                                                                                            
   Thus, to define the functor eiG                                               eG[[t]] , which is the
                                 H in general, it suffices to define the functor iH
                                          G[[t]]
right adjoint to the restriction functor rH      : Rep(G[[t]], Vect) → Rep(H, Vect).
   Let Gi be a congruence subgroup contained in H. We define the functor
                         eiG[[t]] : Rep(H/Gi , V ect) → Rep(G[[t]]/Gi , V ect)
                           H

to equal the corresponding functor defined for locally compact groups.
   Explicitly, for Π = (V, ρ) ∈ Rep(H/Gi , V ect),
                                                                  i
                             eiG[[t]] ≃ Functsm (G[[t]]/Gi , V) H/G ,
                               H

 where Functsm (G[[t]]/Gi ) is the space of functions on G[[t]]/Gi , smooth with respect to the
 action of this group by left translations.
    Note that for Π = (V, ρ) ∈ Rep(H/Gi , V ect) as above, the object of Vect underlying eiG   H ◦
eiG[[t]] (Π) is lim (Wk )H/Gi , where each Wk is a certain subspace of Functlc (Si , V), and Si is

   The above functor Rep(H/Gi , V ect) → Rep(G[[t]]/Gi , V ect) extends to a functor eiH          :
                                                                                          eG[[t]]
Rep(H, V ect) → Rep(G[[t]], V ect). Using Proposition 2.5, from it we obtain the functor iH       :

Rep(H, Vect) → Rep(G[[t]], Vect), which is the right adjoint to rH         : Rep(G[[t]], Vect) →
Rep(H, Vect); and hence also the functor eiG
                                           H : Rep(H, Vect) → Rep(G) with the desired adjoint-
ness property.

composition of the “obvious” functor Rep(G, Vect) → Rep(G[[t]], Vect) coming from the ho-

   More generally, let P ⊂ G be a parabolic, with the Levi quotient M , and let IP ⊂ G[[t]] be
the corresponding parahoric subgroup. (For P = B we will denote IB simply by I, and M by
T ). Let IP (resp., P, M) be the corresponding group-objects of Pro(Set) (resp., Set).
                                                                            G
   In a similar fashion we obtain a pair of mutually adjoint functors rM        : Rep(G) →
                     G
Rep(M, Vect) and iM : Rep(M, Vect) → Rep(G).
   Let now G  b be a central extension of G((t)) by means of Gm (cf. Sect. 2.14), and let Repc (G)b
                                                                                       b
be the corresponding category of representations. Since we are given a splitting of G over G[[t]],
                                                                  b

and hence, over H, we have an obvious restriction functor rH         : Repc (G)
                                                                                                 b

Rep(G, Vect) (resp., Rep(T, Vect)).
3.7. Next we will establish an analogue of Bernstein’s geometric lemma, which describes the
                              b      b
composition of the functors iG       G

   Let Λ be the lattice of co-weights of the maximal torus T of G, and W –the Weyl group.
When we restrict Gb to T ((t)) ⊂ G((t)), the commutator defines a map
                                    T ((t))/T [[t]] × T [[t]] → Gm ,
which factors through T ((t))/T [[t]] ։ Λ and T [[t]] ։ T . In other words, we have a map
                                            Λ × T → Gm ,
which defines a pairing Q : Λ ⊗ Λ → Z. This pairing is W -invariant, since the central extension
of T ((t)) was induced from that of G((t)). For λ ∈ Λ we will denote by φcQ (λ) the character
T → C∗ equal to
                                           Q(λ,·)       c
                                      T −→ Gm → C∗ .
   Recall now the affine flag scheme of G, which is a strict ind-scheme, equal by definition
to G((t))/I (where I is the Iwahori subgroup), and denoted FlG . Its existence, i.e., the ind-
representability of the corresponding functor, follows easily from the case of GrG , cf. [5].
   Recall also that the set of I-orbits on FlG identifies naturally with Waf f ≃ Λ ⋉ W –the
extended affine Weyl group of G. For w ∈ Waf f , let us denote by Flw  G the corresponding orbit
                                                                                              w
and by FlwG its closure. Note that W af f is naturally partially ordered and Flw

   Let Ť be the Langlands dual torus of T (over C), which identifies with the set of unramified
characters of T. For w ∈ Waf f let us denote by w(ρaf f ) − ρaf f the character of T equal to
the projection on T of the sum of negative affine roots which are turned positive by the action
of w−1 . Let µw denote the element in Ť equal to the value of w(ρaf f ) − ρaf f : Gm → Ť on
q ∈ C∗ , where q is the order of the residue field of our local field K.
   For w ∈ Waf f and Π ∈ Rep(T, V ect) we define a new representation w · Π by setting
                                    w · Π := Πw ⊗ φcQ (λ) ⊗ µw ,
where w = λ · w, λ ∈ Λ, w ∈ W , and Πw is obtained from Π by twisting the T-action using w
viewed as an automorphism of T .

  Observe that the character of T, corresponding to measures on the homogeneous space

  Write w = λ · w, λ ∈ Λ, w ∈ W . Observe now that the pull-back of Π under the composition
                                T → St(g)I → I × Gm → I → T
is naturally isomorphic to Πw , and the pull-back of the character c : Gm → C∗ under T →
St(g)I → I × Gm → Gm is φcQ (λ).
     This implies that Vw ≃ w · Π as T-representations.

the partially ordered set Λ+ of dominant weights.
   For every λ ∈ Λ+ , let g ∈ GrλG be a T -stable point, and let St(g)G[[t]] be its stabilizer in
G[[t]], so that GrλG ≃ G[[t]]/St(g)G[[t]]. Note that since G1 is normal in G[[t]], the quotient
G1 \GrλG is a G-homogeneous space isomorphic to G/P λ for a parabolic P λ ⊂ G. Let M λ be
the Levi quotient of P λ , and let µλ be the character of M λ corresponding to measures on the
homogeneous space IP /St(g)G[[t]](K). Note also that for λ as above, the character φcQ (λ) of
T is in fact well-defined as a character of Mλ .

4.1. Assume now that the group G is split, simple and simply-connected. In this case, a
data of an extension G b is equivalent to that of a W -invariant even symmetric bilinear form
Q : Λ ⊗ Λ → Z (cf. Sect. 4 of [4]), and we fix this form to be the minimal one, i.e., 21ȟ Q0 , where
Q0 corresponds to the Killing form, and ȟ is the dual Coxeter number.

field of rational functions on the torus Ť × Gm , viewed as a T × Gm -representation. Note that
by construction, both V and Vrat carry an action of the algebra C[Λaf f ] by endomorphisms.

where Vw := ker Vw → ⊕ Vw′ is isomorphic to w · C[Λaf f ]. In particular, we see that

  The subquotients HomΛaf f −mod (Vw , C(Ť × Gm )) are all identified with C(Ť × Gm ) as left
Λaf f -modules, with the right Λaf f -module structure twisted by w· (see Proposition 3.8). Hence,
we obtain a canonical direct sum decomposition

   Since both isomorphisms preserve the ring structure, it suffices to check that the generators
of C(Ť × Gm ) ⋉ Waf f over C(Ť × Gm ), corresponding to the simple reflections under the two
homomorphisms, act on Vrat in the same way.
   If s is a simple reflection in Waf f , there exists a parahoric Is ⊂ G((t)) such that the corre-
sponding Levi quotient Ms is a reductive group of semi-simple rank 1. As in Sect. 3.6 we have
                         b                                        rat    b     Ms
an induction functor iG  Ms : Rep(Ms , V ect) → Rep(G), and V         ≃ iG
                                                                         Ms ◦ iT×Gm (C(Ť × Gm )),
so that the endomorphism of Vrat corresponding to s via both (4) and the integral operator τs
of [8] come from the corresponding endomorphisms of iM      T×Gm (C(Ť × Gm )).
                                                              s


   Therefore, we have reduced the question about the equality of two endomorphisms of Vrat to
a similar question about endomorphisms of iM     T×Gm (C(Ť × Gm )) in the theory of p-adic groups.
                                                   s


This reduces to the following (well-known) calculation:
   Let G be a split reductive group of semi-simple rank 1, and consider the G(K)-representation
V := iG T (C[Λ]), which identifies with the space of locally-constant compactly supported func-
tions on the quotient G(K)/N (K), where N is the maximal unipotent subgroup of G. We can
view V as a Ť -family of principal series representations, denoted Vt , t ∈ Ť . Let Vrat be the
G-representation iG T (C(Ť )). As above, we have

                        C(Ť ) ⋉ W ≃ EndG(K) (Vrat ) ≃ HomG(K) (V, Vrat ).
Consider the element τs of HomG (V, Vrat ) corresponding to the (unique) simple reflection in
W ⊂ C(Ť ) ⋉ W . Then τs gives rise to a map Vt → Vs·t defined for t belonging to an open
subset of Ť , and the claim is that this map is given by the meromorphic integral operator
f 7→ f τs with
                                             Z
                                   τs
                                  f (g) =         f (g · n · s).
                                                n∈N (K)

                                                                                                           

Corollary 4.4. We have an isomorphism Hq,c ≃ End(Vc ).
Proof. By applying Proposition 3.5 and Proposition 3.8 to V and Vc , we obtain that
HomRep(G)

will now introduce an object of Rep(G) which should be thought of as a cuspidal representation
of G, although at the moment we do not have a definition of cuspidality.

                                    5. The Schwartz space on G
5.1. Suppose now that S is an object of Set, corresponding to a smooth scheme of finite
type S over K. Then it makes sense to consider the space of locally constant compactly
supported measures on S(K), denoted M (S). To define it, we choose locally a top degree
nowhere vanishing differential form ω on S, which defines a measure µ(ω) on S(K). We say
that a measure is locally constant if it can be obtained from µ(ω) by multiplication by a locally
constant function. One readily checks that this definition is independent of the choice of ω.
   Suppose now that φ : S1 → S2 is a smooth map between smooth schemes. In this case, the
operation of push-forward of constantly supported measures preserves the subspaces of locally
constant ones, i.e., it defines a map φ! : M (S1 ) → M (S2 ).
   In particular, if an algebraic group G acts on S, we obtain that M (S) is naturally on object
of Rep(G, V ect).
    For S as above, consider now the object S ∈ Set. It appears that there is no invariant way
to assign to S an object of Vect, which would be a replacement of locally constant compactly
supported measures, and this is similar to the absence of a notion of D-module on S((t)), cf.
[1].
    In this section we will study this phenomenon first when S is the affine space An , and then
when S is an affine algebraic group G.
5.2. For any scheme S which is isomorphic to a projective limit of smooth schemes of finite type
Si with smooth transition maps Si → Sj , we have S ∈ Pro(Set), and we define M (S) ∈ Vect
as M (S) := ”lim” M (Si ), where the maps M (Sj ) → M (Si ) for j ≥ i are the push-forwards of
                ←−
measures.
   Recall that a lattice L ⊂ K((t))n is a finitely generated K[[t]]-submodule, which contains
 i
t · K[[t]] for some i. The “standard” lattice is by definition L0 = K[[t]]. By abuse of notation,
we will denote by the same character L the group-subscheme of An ((t)) corresponding to a
lattice L, and by L the corresponding object of Pro(Set). Since L = lim (L/ti · L), we have a
                                                                                   ←−
                                                                                    i
well-defined object M (L) ∈ Vect.
5.3. For a finite-dimensional vector space H over K let det(H) = Λtop (H) denote its determant
line. Let H and det(H) be the corresponding objects of Set, and let µ(det(H)) denote the 1-
dimensional C-vector space of Haar measures on det(H). 2 Of course, an element of µ(det(H))
determines also a Haar measure on H.
   Recall that for two lattices L, L′ ⊂ K((t))n we can assign their relative determinant line
det(L, L′ ) so that det(L, L′′ ) ≃ det(L, L′ ) ⊗ det(L′ , L′′ ) and for L ⊂ L′ , det(L, L′ ) = det(L′ /L),
where the vector space L′ /L is, by definition, finite-dimensional. Let µ(det(L, L′ )) be the
corresponding line of Haar measures.
Lemma 5.4. For L ⊂ L′ we have a canonical morphism M (L′ ) → M (L) ⊗ µ(det(L, L′ )).
Proof. Let L′′ be a sublattice in L. By definition, for every such L′′ we must construct a mor-
phism M (L′ /L′′ ) → M (L/L′′ ) ⊗ µ(det(L, L′ )). The required map is defined as a composition:
      M (L′ /L′′ ) ≃ Functlc  ′  ′′          ′′  ′          lc    ′′          ′′  ′
                          c (L /L ) ⊗ µ(det(L , L )) → Functc (L/L ) ⊗ µ(det(L , L )) ≃

       Functlc    ′′          ′′                 ′           ′′             ′
            c (L/L ) ⊗ µ(det(L , L)) ⊗ µ(det(L, L )) ≃ M (L/L ) ⊗ µ(det(L, L )),

where the arrow corresponds to the ordinary restriction of functions.
   2Properly speaking, det(H) is a super-vector space; however, in this paper it will appear only via µ(det(H)),
so the difficulties associated with the sign are irrelevant.

   Finally, we are ready to define the object M (An ) ∈ Vect, which we propose as a candidate
for the Schwartz space of functions on An (F):
                               M (An ) := lim M (L) ⊗ µ(det(L, L0 )),
                                           ←−
                                            L

where lim is taken in the category Vect, and the arrows are given by the lemma above.

   It is easy to see that the action of An ((t)) on itself by translations makes M (An ) an object
of Rep(An ).
   Recall also that the group-indscheme GLn ((t)), which acts naturally on An ((t)), has a canon-
                        dn by means of Gm , whose S-points for a test-scheme S are pairs

Proof. By construction, as an object of Vect,

                                         ←−

where the inverse limit is taken over the partially ordered set of pairs of lattices L′ ⊂ L with
(L′1 ⊂ L1 ) ≤ (L′2 ⊂ L2 ) if and only if L1 ⊂ L2 and L′1 ⊃ L′2 .
                                                                    dn (K) on M (An ). For a pair of
   For clarity, let us first define an action of the abstract group GL
lattices L ⊂ L and g ∈ GLn ((t))(K), the action of g defines an isomorphism M (L/L′ ) ≃ M (g ·
            ′

L/g·L′ ) and an isomorphism det(L, L0 ) ≃ det(g·L, g·L0) ≃ det(g·L, L0 )⊗det(L0 , g·L0 ). Hence,
if we lift g to an element of GLdn (K), we obtain an isomorphism det(L, L0 ) ≃ det(g · L, L0 ), i.e.,
we obtain a desired action.
  Let us now repeat this construction in order to obtain an action map dGLn × M (An ) →
    n                dn as ”lim” Sk , and Sk = ”lim” Sk,l with Sk,l ∈ Schf t . Set Sk (resp.,
M (A ). Let us write GL
                                  −→                    ←−
Sk,l ) to be the corresponding objects of Pro(Set) (resp., Set).
   Recall that if S is a scheme, there is a notion of an S-family of lattices in K((t))n , which is in
fact the same as an S-point of the affine Grassmannian of GLn . If L and L′ are two S-families
of lattices with L′ ⊂ L, then the quotient L/L′ is a vector bundle on S.
   For a pair of lattices L′ ⊂ L ⊂ K((t))n and an index k, using the action of GLn ((t)) on
GrGLn , we obtain the Sk -families of lattices that we will denote by Sk · L′ ⊂ Sk · L. Moreover,
there exists another pair of lattices L′1 ⊂ L1 , thought of as constant Sk -families, such that
L′1 ⊂ Sk · L′ and Sk · L ⊂ L1 . Consider the quotients
                     HSk := Sk · L′ /L′1 ⊂ HS′ k := Sk · L/L′1 ⊂ HS′′k := L1 /L′1
as vector bundles on Sk . Note that both HS′ k /HSk and HS′′k are trivial bundles with fibers L/L′
and L1 /L′1 , respectively. By the definition of d
                                                 GLn , the line bundle det(HS′′k /HS′ k ) is identified
with the trivial line bundle with fiber det(L, L1 ). Finally, there exists an index l, so that HSk
and HS′ k , together with their embeddings into HS′′k , come from vector bundles on Sk,l , which
we will denote by HSk,l and HS′ k,l , respectively.
   We need to construct an action map Sk,l × (M (L1 /L′1 ) ⊗ µ(det(L1 , L))) → M (L/L′ ), which
on the level of K-points amounts to the one constructed above. For that, by Zariski localizing

Sl,k , we may assume that the vector bundle HS′ k,l on Sk,l can be trivialized, i.e., HS′ k,l ≃
H ′ × Sk,l .
   Thus, we have a map Sk,l × H′ → L1 /L′1 , such that the corresponding map Sk,l × H′ →
Sk,l × L1 /L′1 is proper (cf. Sect. 3.2). Therefore, it defines an action map
                              Sk,l × Functlc      ′          lc  ′
                                          c (L1 /L1 ) → Functc (H ).

By tensoring with µ(det(H′ )) we obtain an action map Sk,l × (M (L1 /L′1 ) ⊗ µ(det(L1 , L))) →
M (H′ ).
   Similarly, we have a map Sk,l × H′ → L/L′ , and by integration we obtain an action map
Sk,l × M (H′ ) → M (L/L′ ). The composition
          Hom(Sk,l ⊗ M (H′ ), M (L/L′ )) × Hom(Sk,l ⊗ M (L1 /L′1 ), M (H′ )) →
          Hom((Sk,l × Sk,l ) ⊗ M (L1 /L′1 ), M (L/L′ )) → Hom(Sk,l ⊗ M (L/L′ ), M (H))
yields the desired action.

  For example, it is easy to see that when G ≃ An (and the central extension is trivial), the
space M (G) obtained in this way identifies canonically with M (An ) considered above.

5.7. Since each Gi is a normal subgroup in G[[t]], the terms of the inverse system defining
Mc (G) carry a commuting G[[t]]-action on the right, which is respected by the arrows. Hence,
Mc (G) carries an additional G[[t]]-action “on the right”, which commutes with the action of Gb
“on the left”.
   This Gb − G[[t]]-module structure on Mc (G) allows to reinterpret the functor iGb introduced
                                                                                  H
earlier:
   Recall that the functor of tensor product V ect × V ect → V ect extends naturally to Vect:
                        (”lim” Vi ) ⊗ (”lim” Wj ) := ”lim” (Vi ⊗ Wj ).
                             ←−          ←−              ←−

  Let H ⊂ G[[t]] be a thick subgroup, and let Π = (V, ρ) be an object of Rep(H, Vect).
Consider the tensor product Mc (G) ⊗ V ∈ Vect. The diagonal action of H makes it into an
                                                   b
object of Rep(H, Vect), which carries a commuting G-action. Hence, (Mc (G) ⊗ V)H is naturally
an object of Rep(G).
  The following is straightforward from the definitions:
                                                              b
Lemma 5.8. We have a natural isomorphism in Rep(G): iG
                                                     H (Π) ≃ (Mc (G) ⊗ V)H .

5.9. Since we think of Mc (G) as the space of functions on the group G, it is natural to expect
that the G[[t]]-action on Mc (G) considered above extends to an action “on the right” of the
entire group G = G((t)), corresponding to right translations. The existence of such an action
is given by the theorem below.
                                                                                           dg
    Let g be the Lie algebra of G, let GLg ((t)) be the corresponding loop group, and let GL
                                                            b
be its canonical central extension as in Theorem 5.5. Let G0 be the central extension of G((t))
induced from GL dg by means of the adjoint action. For example, if G is simple and simply-
connected, the extension G b 0 corresponds to the pairing Λ ⊗ Λ → Z given by the Killing form.
         b ′
    Let G be the central extension of G((t)) equal to the Baer sum of G    b0 and the original
             b       ′                           b ′
extension G. Let c be the character of Gm ⊂ G equal to the inverse of the product of c and
                                        17→q
c0 , where c0 is the character Gm → Z −→ C∗ .

Theorem 5.10. We have a canonical action of G    b ′ on Mc (G), with Gm ⊂ Gb ′ acting by the
           ′
character c . This action extends the natural action of G[[t]] on Mc (G) “on the right” and
                            b “on the left”.
commutes with the action of G

5.11. Proof of Theorem 5.10. Let us first construct an action of the abstract group G b ′ (K)
on Mc (G). For an integer i and a point g ∈ G((t))(K), there exists an integer j such that
g −1 (Gj )g is contained in Gi ; therefore, the right multiplication map G((t)) × g → G((t))
descends to a well-defined map G((t))/Gj × g → G((t))/Gi .
                                                b
   In particular, if we lift g to an element of G(K), we obtain a map
                                 b           i                        b
                                iG
                                 Gj (C) ⊗ µ(G /g
                                                 −1
                                                    (Gj )g) → iG
                                                               Gi (C),

                             b
which commutes with the left G-action.
   We claim now that a lift of g to an element of G    b0 (K) define an identification of the line
µ(Gi /g −1 (Gj )g) with µ(Gi /Gj ). Indeed, let gi be the Lie subalgebra in g((t)) corresponding
to the congruence subgroup Gi , then
              µ(Gi /Gj ) ≃ µ(det(gi /gj )); µ(Gi /g −1 (Gj )g) ≃ µ(det(gi /g −1 · gj )),
and
       det(gi /gj ) ≃ det(gi /g −1 · gj ) ⊗ det(g · gj , gj ) ≃ det(gi /g −1 · gj ) ⊗ det(g · g0 , g0 ).

   Therefore, if we take the Baer product of the extensions G b and G b 0 we obtain an action of
                          b ′
the group of K-points of G on Mc (G). Therefore, by passing to inverses, we obtain on Mc (G)
             b ′ (K), commuting with the left action of G
an action of G                                          b and the prescribed value of the central
character.
  The fact the constructed point-wise action gives rise to a well-defined action map G       b′ ×
Mc (G) → Mc (G) follows by considering families, as in the proof of Theorem 5.5.

  Namely, if G      b0 = ”lim” Sk , Sk = ”lim” Sk,l with Sk,l ∈ Schf t , for every pair of indices

i, k there exists a large enough index j, such that the group-subscheme AdSk (Gj ) ⊂ G((t)) × Sk

with the constant line bundle with fiber det(gj , gi ).
    We have the map
