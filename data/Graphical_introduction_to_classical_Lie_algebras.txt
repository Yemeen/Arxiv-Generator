                                                                                               Abstract
                                                          We develop a graphical notation to introduce classical Lie algebras. Although this pa-
                                                       per deals with well-known results, our pictorial point of view is slightly different to the
                                                       traditional one. Our graphical notation is fairly elementary and easy to handle and, thus
                                                       provides an effective tool for computations with classical Lie algebras. More over, it may
                                                       be regarded as a first and foundational step in the process of uncovering the categorical
                                                       meaning of Lie algebras.


                                             1        Introduction
                                             A first step in the study of an arbitrary category C is to define the appropriated set S(C) of
                                             isomorphisms classes of simple objects in C. For example, an object y ∈ Ob(C) of an abelian
                                             category C (see [5]) is said to be simple if in any exact sequence

                                                                                         0 → x → y → z → 0,

                                             either x is isomorphic to 0 or z is isomorphic to 0. It is a remarkable fact that non-equivalent
                                             categories may very well have equivalent sets of isomorphisms classes of simple objects. Let us
                                             introduce a list of categories that at first seem to be utterly unrelated and yet the corresponding
                                             sets of simple objects are deeply connected.

                                                 1. WeylGroup ⊂ FinGroup ⊂ LieGroup ⊂ Group.
                                                       We denote by Group the category whose objects are groups and whose morphisms are
                                                       group homomorphisms. We let LieGroup denote the subcategory of Group whose
                                                       objects are finite dimensional complex Lie groups. Morphism in LieGroup are smooth
                                                       group homomorphisms. We define FinGroup to be the full subcategory of Group whose
                                                       objects are finite groups and WeylGroup to be the full subcategory of Group whose
                                                       objects are Weyl groups.

  S(Group) denotes the set of isomorphisms classes of groups having no proper normal
  subgroups. S(LieGroup) denotes the set of isomorphisms classes of Lie groups which
  are simple as groups and also are connected and simply connected. S(FinGroup) denotes
  the set of isomorphisms classes of finite simple groups. S(WeylGroup) denotes the set
  isomorphisms classes of Weyl groups, which can be taken to be An = Sn+1 , Bn = Cn =
  Zn2 ⋉ Sn , Dn = Z2n−1 ⋉ Sn , where Sn is the group of permutations in n letters, and
  E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 , G2 are so called exceptional groups.

2. LieAlg denotes the category whose objects are finite dimensional complex Lie algebras,
   morphism are Lie algebra homomorphism. S(LieAlg) is the set of isomorphisms classes
   of simple Lie algebras, i.e., Lie algebras having no proper ideals.

3. Root denotes the category of root systems.

     • Objects in Root are triples (V, h , i, Φ) such that
         – (V, h , i) is an Euclidean space.
         – Φ is a finite set spanning V .
         – If α ∈ Φ then −α ∈ Φ, but kα 6∈ Φ if k is any real number other then ±1.
         – For α ∈ Φ the reflection Sα in the hyperplane α⊥ = {x ∈ V : hx, αi = 0} maps
           Φ to itself.
                                  hα, βi
         – For α, β ∈ Φ, Aα,β = 2        ∈ Z.
                                  hα, αi
     • Morphisms in Root from (V1 , h , i1 , Φ1 ) to (V2 , h , i2 , Φ2 ) consists of linear trans-
       formations T : V1 −→ V2 such that hT (x), T (y)i2 = hx, yi1 for all x, y ∈ V1 , and
       T (Φ1 ) ⊂ Φ2 .
     • Suppose that (Vi , h , iVi , Φi ), i = 1, . . . , n are root systems, then the direct sum
       V = ni=1 Vi is an Euclidean vector space with inner product
           L

                                                       n
                                                       X
                                            h , iV =         h , iVi
                                                       i=1

       Moreover setting Φ = ni=1 Φi , the triple (V, h , iV , Φ) becomes a root system called
                             F

       the direct sum of root systems (Vi , h , iVi , Φi ). S(Root) is the set of isomorphisms
       classes of simple root systems, i.e., root systems which are not isomorphic to the
       direct sum of two non-vanishing root systems.

4. Dynkin denotes the category of Dynkin diagrams.

     • Objects in Dynkin are called Dynkin diagrams and are non-directed graphs ∆ with
       the following properties
         – The set V∆ of vertices of ∆ is equal to {1, . . . , n} for some n ≥ 1.

                                               2
            – The number of edges joining two vertices in ∆ is 0, 1, 2 or 3.
            – If vertices i and j are joined by 2 or 3 edges, then an arrow is chosen pointing
              either from i to j, or from j to i.
            – The quadratic form
                                                               n
                                                               X             X√
                                Q(x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) = 2         x2i −          nij xi xj
                                                               i=1           i6=j

              where (nij ) is the adjacency matrix of ∆, i.e., nij equal the number of edges
              from vertex i to vertex j is positive definite.
        • Morphism in Dynkin from diagram ∆1 to diagram ∆2 consists of maps ρ : V∆1 →
          V∆2 such that Q2 (xρ(1) , xρ(2) , · · · , xρ(n) ) = Q1 (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ).
        • S(Dynkin) denotes the set of of isomorphisms classes of connected Dynkin diagrams

Next theorem gives an explicit characterization of S(Dynkin).

Theorem 1. S(Dynkin) consists of the Dynkin diagrams included in the following list

                                An , n ≥ 1                 ···

                                Bn , n ≥ 2                 ··· >

                                Cn , n ≥ 3                 ··· <

                                Dn , n ≥ 4                 ···


                                        E6


                                    E7


                                   E8

                                          F4         >

                                               G2    >

                            Figure 1: Simple Dynkin diagrams.




                                                 3
We enunciate the following fundamental

Theorem 2.          1. WeylGroup ⊂ S(FinGroup) ⊂ S(LieGroup) ⊂ S(Group).

    2. S(LieGroup) ∼
                   = S(LieAlg) ∼
                               = S(Root) ∼
                                         = S(Dynkin) → WeylGroup.

Part 1 of Theorem 2 is obvious. Although we shall not give a complete proof of part 2 the
reader will find in the body of this paper many statements that shed light into its meaning.
The map S(Dynkin) −→ WeylGroup is surjective but if fails to be injective. Diagrams Bn
and Cn of the list above have both Zn2 ⋊ Sn as associated Weyl groups.


2     Lie Algebras
We proceed to consider in details the category of Lie algebras. First we recall the notion of a
Lie group.

Definition 3. A group (G, m) is said to be a Lie group if

    1. G is a finite dimensional smooth manifold.

    2. the map m : G × G −→ G given by m(a, b) = ab, for all a, b ∈ G, is smooth.

    3. The map I : G → G given by I(a) = a−1 , for all a ∈ G, is smooth.

Definition 4. A Lie algebra (g, [ , ]) over a field k is a vector space g together with a binary
operation [ , ] : g × g −→ g, called the Lie bracket, satisfying

    1. [ , ] is a bilinear operation.

    2. Antisymmetry: [x, y] = −[y, x] for each x, y ∈ g.

    3. Jacobi identity: [x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] + [y, [x, z]] for each x, y, z ∈ g.

Example 5. A k-algebra A may be regarded as a Lie algebra (A, [ , ]), with bracket [x, y] =
xy − yx for all x, y ∈ A. In particular End(V ) is a Lie algebra for any k-vector space V .

Example 6. Let M be a smooth manifold. The space Γ(M ) = {X : M −→ T M, X(m) ∈
Tm M, m ∈ M } of vector fields on M is a Lie algebra with the Lie bracket

                                     ∂Y i ∂           i
                                                 j ∂X ∂
                     [X, Y ] = X j           − Y           , for all X, Y ∈ Γ(M ).
                                     ∂xj ∂xi       ∂xj ∂xi
Example 7. Let G be a Lie group. The space Te (G) tangent to the identity e ∈ G is a Lie
algebra since Te (G) ∼
                     = Γ(G)G is a Lie subalgebra of Γ(G).



                                                     4
Definition 8. A morphism of Lie algebras ρ : g −→ h is a linear map ρ from g to h such that
ρ([x, y]) = [ρ(x), ρ(y)] for x, y ∈ g. A representation ρ of a Lie algebra g on a k-vector space V
is a morphism ρ : g → End(V ) of Lie algebras.

The functor
                       Te : LieGroup −→ LieAlg
                                 G     7−→ Te (G)
                            ϕ : G → H 7−→  de ϕ : Te (G) → Te (H)
induces an equivalence between S(LieGroup) and S(LieAlg).

Definition 9. For any Lie algebra g the adjoint representation ad : g → End(g) is given by
ad(x)(y) = [x, y] for all x, y ∈ g.

Definition 10.     1. A subspace I of a Lie algebra g is called a Lie subalgebra if [x, y] ∈ I for
     all x, y ∈ I.

  2. A subalgebra I of g is said to be abelian if [x, y] = 0 for all x, y ∈ I.

  3. A subalgebra I of a Lie algebra g is called an ideal if [x, y] ∈ I for all x ∈ I and y ∈ g.

Example 11. For any k-algebra the space of derivations of A
Der(A) = {d : A −→ A | d(xy) = d(x)y +xd(y) for all x, y ∈ A}is a Lie subalgebra of End(A).

Definition 12.      1. A Lie algebra g is called simple if it has no ideals other than g and {0}.

  2. A Lie algebra g is called semisimple if it has no abelian ideals other than {0}.

  3. A maximal abelian subalgebra h of g is called a Cartan subalgebra.

Next theorem is due to Cartan. A proof of it may be found in [3].

Theorem 13. Let g be a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra over C, then g is isomorphic to
one of those in the list sln (C), sp2n (C), so2n (C), so2n+1 (C), E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 and G2 .

Algebras sln (C), sp2n (C), so2n (C) and so2n+1 (C) are called classical and will be explained using
our graphical notation in Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8. The algebras E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 and G2 are called
exceptional and the reader may find their definitions in [3].

Definition 14. The Killing form on g is the bilinear map h , i : g×g −→ C given for all x, y ∈ g
by hx, yi = tr(ad(x) ◦ ad(y)), where ◦ denotes the product in End(g) and tr : End(g) → C is the
trace map.

Denote by h∗ the linear dual of vector space h. The following proposition describes representa-
tions of abelian Lie algebras.



                                                 5
Proposition 15. Let h be an abelian Lie algebra and ρ : h → End(V ) a representation of h.
Then V admits a decomposition
                                           M
                                      V =      Vα                                      (1)
                                                       α∈Φ

where for each α ∈    h∗ ,   Vα = {x ∈ V : ρ(h)(x) = α(h)x, for all                 h ∈ h}, and Φ = {α ∈
h∗ | hα 6= 0}.

Equation (1) is called Cartan decomposition of the representation ρ of h. Proposition 15 yields
a map from S(LieAlg) into S(Root), which turns out to be a bijection, as follows. Let g be a
finite dimensional simple Lie algebra over C and h ⊂ g a Cartan subalgebra. The killing form
h , i : h × h −→ C restricted to h is non-degenerated and makes the pair (h, h , i) an Euclidean
space. The linear dual h∗ has an induced Euclidean structure, which we still denote by h , i
induced by the linear isomorphism f : h −→ h∗ given by f (x)(y) = hx, yi, for all x, y ∈ h.
The adjoint representation ad : h −→ End(g) restricted to h give us a Cartan decomposition
     M
g=        gα where for each α ∈ h gα = {x ∈ g| [h, x] = α(h)x, for all h ∈ h} and Φ = {α ∈
    α∈Φ
h∗ : hα 6= 0}. It is not difficult to show that the triple (h∗ , h , i, Φ) is a root system.

Definition 16. Let g be a simple Lie algebra and let Φ the root systems associated to g. The
                                                                         hα,βi
group W generated by all reflections Sα with α ∈ Φ, where Sα (β) = β − 2 hα,αi α, is known as
the Weyl group associated to g.

One can show that there exists a subset Π = {α1 , α2 , . . . , αn } of Φ such that Π is a basis of h∗
and each root α ∈ Φ can be written as a linear combination of roots in Π with coefficients in Z
which are either all non-negative or all non-positive. The set Π is called a set of fundamental
roots. The integers
                                                 hαi , αj i
                                         Aij = 2                                                  (2)
                                                 hαi , αi i
are called the Cartan integers and the matrix A = (Aij ) is called the Cartan matrix. Notice
that Aii = 2, and that for any αi , αj ∈ Π with i 6= j, Sαi (αj ) is a Z-combination of αi and αj .
Since the coefficient of αj is 1, the coefficient associated to αi in Sαi (αj ) must be a non-positive
integer, i.e., Aij ∈ Z≤0 . The angle θij between αi , αj is given by the cosine formula
                                                        1           1
                                hαi , αj i = hαi , αi i 2 hαj , αj i 2 cos(θij ).

Then we have
                                                      hαi , αj i hαj , αi i
                                  4 cos2 (θij ) = 2             ·2          ,
                                                      hαj , αj i hαi , αi i
and therefore 4 cos2 (θij ) = Aij Aji . Let nij = Aij Aji clearly nij ∈ Z and nij ≥ 0. Since
−1 ≤ cos(θij ) ≤ 1 the only possible values for nij are nij = 0, 1, 2 or 3.

Definition 17. The Dynkin diagram ∆ associated to a simple Lie algebra g is the graph ∆ with
vertices {1, . . . , n} in bijective correspondence with the set Π of fundamental roots of g such that

                                                        6
   1. Vertices i, j with i 6= j are joined by nij = Aij Ai edges, where Aij is given by formula (2).

   2. Between each double edge or triple we attach the symbol <, or the symbol > pointing
      towards the shorter root with respect to Killing form.

Theorem 18. Consider the root decomposition of the simple Lie algebra g with respect to h. Let
α ∈ Φ be a root, for each nonzero xα ∈ gα there is x−α ∈ gα and hα ∈ h such that α(hα ) = 2,
[xα , x−α ] = hα , [hα , xα ] = 2xα and [hα , x−α ] = 2x−α .

Theorem 18 implies that for any root α ∈ Φ, xα , x−α and hα span a subalgebra sα such that
sα ∼
   = sl2 (C), see Section 4 for a definition of sl2 (C). This fact explain the distinguished role
played by sl2 (C) in the representation theory of simple Lie algebras.

Definition 19. Let Φ ⊂ h be the root system associated with a simple Lie algebra g.

   1. For any α ∈ Φ, the Cartan element hα ∈ h given by Theorem 18 is called the coroot
      associated to root α. Φc = {hα : α ∈ Φ} is the coroot system associated to h and
      Πc = {hα : α ∈ Π} is the set of fundamental coroots.

   2. The elements w1 , . . . , wn in h∗ given by the relations wi (hj ) = δij , for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤
      n, where hj is the coroot associated to fundamental root αj , are called the fundamental
      weights.

One can recover a simple Lie algebra g from its associated Dynkin diagram ∆ as follows: Let nij
be the adjacency matrix of ∆. The relation nij = Aij Aji determines univocally the Cartan ma-
trix Aij . Consider the free Lie algebra generated by the symbols H1 , . . . , Hn , X1 , . . . , Xn , Y1 , . . . , Yn .
Form the quotient of this free Lie algebra by the relations

         [Hi , Hj ] = 0 (all i, j);             [Xi , Yi ] = Hi (all i);              [Xi , Xj ] = 0 (i 6= j);

         [Hi , Xj ] = Aij Xj (all i, j); [Hi , Yj ] = −Aij Yj (all i, j);

    and for all i 6= j,

                [Xi , Xj ] = 0,                        [Yi , Yj ] = 0,                  if Aij = 0.

                [Xi , [Xi , Xj ]] = 0,                 [Yi , [Yi , Yj ]] = 0            if Aij = −1.

                [Xi , [Xi , [Xi , Xj ]]] = 0,          [Yi , [Yi , [Yi , Yj ]]] = 0     if Aij = −2.

                [Xi , [Xi , [Xi , [Xi , Xj ]]]] = 0, [Yi , [Yi , [Yi , [Yi , Yj ]]]] = 0 if Aij = −3.

Serre shows that the resulting Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra isomorphic
to g. See [10] for more details.

2.1    Jacobian Criterion
Let k be a field of characteristic zero and let V be a finite dimensional k-vector space. Set
V = he1 , e2 , . . . , en i and V ∗ = hx1 , x2 , . . . , xn i such that xi (ej ) = δij . We have
                                            n
                                           X         
                                      xk         ai ei = ak , 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
                                           i=1

Any f ∈ V is written as f = b1 x1 + b2 x2 + · · · + bn xn . Denote by S = S(V ∗ ) the symmetric
             ∗

algebra of the dual space V ∗ which can be identify with the polynomial ring k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ].
Let G be a finite group which acts on V . G also acts on V ∗ , and thus it acts on S = S(V ∗ ) as
follows
                                  S(V ∗ ) × G −→ S(V ∗ )
                                     (p, g)      7−→ p(g)
where (pg)(v) = p(gv), for all g ∈ G, p ∈ S(V ∗ ), v ∈ V. The algebra

                   k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]G = {p ∈ k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ] : p(g) = p, ∀g ∈ G}

is called the G-invariant subalgebra of k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ].
Definition 20. Let K be a field and F a extension of K. Let S be a subset of F . The set S
is algebraically dependent over K if for any positive integer n there is a polynomial non-zero
f ∈ k[x1 , . . . , xn ] such that f (s1 , . . . , sn ) = 0 for any different s1 , . . . , sn ∈ S. In otherwise S is
algebraically independent.
Theorem 21. Let C[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]W be the subalgebra of C[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ] consisting of W -
invariant polynomials, then C[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]W is generated as an C-algebra by n homogeneous,
algebraically independent elements of positive degree together with 1.
The idea of proof of Theorem 21 goes as follows: let I be the ideal of C[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ] gen-
erated by all homogeneous W -invariant polynomials of positive degree. Using Hilbert’s Basis
Theorem we may choose a minimal generating set f1 , f2 , . . . , fr for I consisting of homoge-
neous W -invariant polynomials of positive degree. One can show that r = n and furthermore
C[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]W = C[f1 , f2 , . . . , fn ].
Proposition 22. Let f1 , . . . , fn and g1 , . . . , gn be two sets of homogeneous, algebraically inde-
pendent generators of C[x1 , . . . , xn ]W with degrees di and ei respectively, then (after reordering)
di = ei for all i = 1, . . . , n.
The numbers d1 , . . . , dn written in increasing order are called the degrees of W . Theorem 23
below is a simple criterion for the algebraic independence of polynomials f1 , . . . , fn expressed
in terms of the Jacobian determinant. We write J(f1 , . . . , fn ) for the determinant of the n × n
                               ∂fi
matrix whose (i, j)-entry is ∂x  j
                                   .
Theorem 23 (Jacobian criterion). The set of polynomials f1 , . . . , fn ∈ k[x1 , . . . , xn ] are
algebraically independent over a field k of characteristic zero if and only if J(f1 , . . . , fn ) 6= 0.

4     Linear special algebra sl2 (C)
We begin studying the special linear algebra sl2 (C). It plays a distinguished role in the theory
of Lie algebras. By definition we have

                                  sl2 (C) = {A ∈ End(C2 ) : tr(A) = 0}.

As subspace of Digraph1 (2, 2), sl2 (C) is the following vector space
                                                                               2     1

                        sl2 (C) =             6 −              6,          3 , k                      ⊂ Digraph1 (2, 2)

We fix as Cartan subalgebra of sl2 (C) the 1-dimensional subspace
                                      n                                                                               o

The dual space is h∗ = ha1 , a2 i/{a1 + a2 = 0}, where

4.1   Root system of sl2 (C)
Consider the projection map ha1 , a2 i −→ ha1 , a2 i/{a1 + a2 = 0}. We still denote by ai the
image of ai under the projection above. Now each h ∈ h is of the form

                                 h=               a1 6             +a2               6,              a1 , a. 2 ∈ h∗

Therefore the root system of sl2 (C) is Φ = {a1 − a2 , a2 − a1 }. Setting α = a1 − a2 we have that
the roots are α and −α and the set of fundamental roots is Π = {α}. In pictures

sending each directed graph into its opposite graph. Clearly T is an antimorphism, i.e, T (ab) =
T (b)T (a), for all a, b ∈ Digraph1 (n, n). For example,

5.4    Weyl group of sln (C)
Consider the fundamental roots αi = ai −ai+1 , i = 1, . . . , n−1 and Sαi the reflection associated
to the fundamental root αi . Let h ∈ h and hαi be the coroot associated to the fundamental
root αi . By definition we have Sαi (h) = h − αi (h)hαi
                                                                                                                                       
      Sαi (h) = a1 6   + · · · +ai     6 + ai+1                  6 + · · · + an               6 − (ai − ai+1 )            6   −    6

so we see that reflections Sαi has the form

5.6   Invariant polynomials for sln (C)
Consider the action of Sn+1 on Rn+1 given by

                                 Sn+1 × Rn+1 −→       Rn+1
                                    (π, x)   7−→ (πx)i = xπ−1 (i)

notice that the permutation (ij) acts as a reflection on Rn+1 since

                                (ij)(xi − xj ) = xj − xi = −(xi − xj )

                         (ij)(x) = x, si x ∈ (xi − xj )⊥ (es decir xi = xj )

Since Sn+1 is generated by transpositions (i i+1), i = 1, . . . , n, then Sn+1 is an example of what
is called a reflection group. Recall that a linear action of a group G on a vector space V is said
to be effective if the only fixed point is 0. The action of Sn+1 on Rn+1 fixes points in Rn+1 lying
on the straight line {(x, x, . . . , x)| x ∈ R}. Thus the action of An on Rn+1 fails to be effective.
If we instead let An act on the hyperplane V = {(x1 . . . xn+1 ) ∈ Rn+1 | x1 + · · · + xn+1 = 0}
then the action becomes effective. Consider the power symmetric functions

                                 fi = xi+1
                                       1   + · · · + xi+1
                                                      n+1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Each fi is Sn+1 -invariant, and together the power symmetric functions form a set of basic
invariants. This fact can be proven as follows: first notice that

              gr(f1 )gr(f2 ) · · · gr(fn ) = 2 · 3 · · · n(n + 1) = (n + 1)! = |Sn+1 | = |An |.


                                                     15
Next, it is easy to compute the Jacobian J(f1 , f2 , · · · , fn ) yielding the nonvanishing polynomial

                                                             Y                             n
                                                                                           Y
            J(f1 , f2 , · · · , fn ) = (n + 1)!                        (xj − xi )            (x1 + · · · + 2xi + · · · + xn )
                                                         1≤i<j≤n                           i=1

Finally, use the Jacobian criterion.

where {ai } is the base of h∗ dual to the natural base of h. As for the case of the symplectic
algebra we define a map T : Digraph1 (2n, 2n) −→ Digraph1 (2n, 2n). T sends a given graph
to its opposite if it does not cross the vertical line, and to minus its opposite if it crosses the
vertical line. We have again that T (ab) = T (b)T (a) For example,

To get the negative roots it is enough to apply T to the positive roots. Therefore the root
system is Φ = {ai − aj , aj − ai , ai + aj , −ai − aj , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} and the fundamental roots can
be taken to be Π = {α1 , . . . , αn } where αi = ai − ai+1 , i = 1, . . . , n − 1 and αn = an−1 + an

      in this case (ai − aj )(hi − hj ) = 2, thus hi − hj is the coroot associated to the root ai − aj .

      since (ai + aj )(−hi − hj ) = −2, hi + hj is the coroot associated to the root ai + aj .

We concluded that Φc = {hi −hj , hj −hi , hi +hj , −hi −hj , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} is the coroot system of
so2n (C). The set of fundamental coroots is given by Πc = {hi − hi+1 , hn−1 + hn ; 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}

clearly each fi is invariant under the action of Z2n−1 ⋊ Sn . It is easy to check that

      Since (ai − aj )(hi − hj ) = 2, we see that hi − hj is the coroot associated to the root ai − aj .

      Here (ai + aj )(−hi − hj ) = −2, and thus hi + hj is the coroot associated to the root ai + aj .

      Thus 2hi is the coroot associated to the root ai .

We have that Φc = {hi − hj , hj − hi , hi + hj , −hi − hj , 2hi , −2hi , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} is the coroot
system of so2n+1 (C). The set of fundamental coroot has the form Πc = {hi − hi−1 , 2hn ; 1 ≤
i ≤ n − 1} where

The fundamental weights are wi = a1 + · · · + ai , i = 1, · · · , n − 1 and wn =                 . In
                                                                                        2
a similar fashion to the so2n (C) case we have that wi (hj − hj+1 ) = δij and wi (2hn ) = δin .

8.4   Weyl group of so2n+1 (C)
Consider the fundamental roots αi = ai − ai+1 . Just like for sln+1 (C), the reflections associated
to these roots generate the symmetric group Sn . Let us analyze the reflection associated to the
root αn = an . Let h ∈ h, we have Sαn (h) = h − αn (h)hαn where hαn is the coroot associated
to the root αn

This reflections represent sign changes and generate the group Zn2 , therefore the Weyl group

The diagram has n vertices, one for each fundamental root. The killing form is given by
hαi , αi+1 i = 1, if i = 1, . . . , n − 1 and hαn−1 , αn i = 2. Furthermore hαn−1 , αn−1 i > hαn , αn i,
and thus, the Dynkin diagram of so2n+1 (C) has form
