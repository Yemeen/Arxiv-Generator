                                                                                  ALEXANDER PREMET

                                                    Abstract. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically
                                                    closed field k of characteristic p ≥ 0, and g = Lie G. In positive characteristic,
                                                    suppose in addition that p is good for G and the derived subgroup of G is simply
                                                    connected. Let N = N (g) denote the nilpotent variety of g, and Cnil (g) := {(x, y) ∈
                                                    N × N | [x, y] = 0}, the nilpotent commuting variety of g. Our main goal in this
                                                    paper is to show that the variety Cnil (g) is equidimensional. In characteristic 0, this
                                                    confirms a conjecture of Vladimir Baranovsky; see [2]. When applied to GL(n),
                                                    our result in conjunction with an observation in [2] shows that the punctual (local)
                                                    Hilbert scheme Hn ⊂ Hilbn (P2 ) is irreducible over any algebraically closed field.



                                                                                     1. Introduction
                                                Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p ≥ 0. The purpose of this
                                             note is to confirm Baranovsky’s conjecture [2, p. 4] which states that all irreducible
                                             components of the nilpotent commuting variety Cnil (g) of a complex semisimple Lie
                                             algebra g have the same dimension, equal to dim g, and are parametrised by the
                                             distinguished nilpotent orbits in g. The main result in [2] confirmed the conjecture for
                                             g = sl(n) (an earlier proof of the irreducibility of Cnil (sl(n)) in [12] was incomplete).
                                             Notably, it is observed in [2] that in any characteristic the number of irreducible
                                             components of Cnil (sl(n)) equals the number of irreducible components of the punctual
                                             Hilbert scheme Hn ⊂ Hilbn (P2 ); see [2, Remark 1].
                                                The punctual Hilbert scheme Hn parametrises the ideals of colength n in the ring
                                             of formal power series k[[x, y]]. In characteristic 0, the scheme Hn is known to be
                                             irreducible for more than 25 years thanks to the work of Briançon [6]. This was
                                             extended to the case where p > n by Iarrobino [14]; see also [11]. These results
                                             enabled Baranovsky to deduce that Cnil (sl(n)) is irreducible for p = 0 and p > n. It
                                             should be mentioned here that very recently a more direct proof of the irreducibility
                                             of Cnil (sl(n)) was found by Basili in [1]. It works for p ≥ n/2 and p = 0 implying the
                                             irredicibility of Hn for p in that range.
                                                In this note we give a direct proof of Baranovsky’s conjecture entirely in the frame-
                                             work of Lie Theory. In view of [2, Remark 1], this will enable us to conclude that
                                             Hn is irreducible over any algebraically closed field. For p < n/2, this appears to be
                                             a new result in Algebraic Geometry. Our approach also provides a much shorter and
                                             more elementary proof of the irreducibility of Hn over C. In principle, it can be used
                                             for investigating the connected components of Hn over other locally compact fields;
                                             see [14] and [2, Remark 2].
                                                Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over k and g = Lie G. We assume
                                             throughout the paper that the derived subgroup (G, G) is simply connected and p

                                                                                               1
is good for the root system of G. When p > 0, the Lie algebra g carries a natural
(Ad G)-equivariant [p]-mapping x 7→ x[p] . In this case, an element e ∈ g is called
                 N
nilpotent if e[p] = 0 for N large enough. When p = 0, we say that e is nilpotent
if e ∈ [g, g] and the endomorphism ad e is nilpotent. The variety of all nilpotent
elements in g is denoted by N . It is well-known that N is an irreducible Zariski
closed subset in g of dimension dim G − rk G and G acts on N with finitely many
orbits; see [30]. Moreover, the Bala–Carter theory holds in good characteristic and
the (Ad G)-orbits in N are described in the same way as over C. In other words, any
nilpotent element in g is (Ad G)-conjugate to a Richardson element in a distinguished
parabolic subalgebra of Lie L where L is a Levi subgroup of G; see [7, 23, 24, 29]. Let
                    Cnil (g) := {(x, y) ∈ N × N | [x, y] = 0} ⊂ g × g,
the nilpotent commuting variety of g. Obviously, the Zariski closed set Cnil (g) is
preserved by the diagonal action of G on g × g.
   Given a closed subgroup H in G we denote by ZH (e) the centraliser of e in H.
As usual we denote by Ru (H) the unipotent radical of H. An element e ∈ N is
called distinguished if the connected component of Z(G,G) (e) is unipotent, that is if
Lie Z(G,G) (e) ⊂ N . According to the main result of the Bala–Carter theory, any
distinguished nilpotent element in g is Richardson in a distinguished parabolic subal-
gebra of g. Note that for any distinguished e ∈ N we have (e, Lie Z(G,G) (e)) ⊂ Cnil (g).
We denote by C(e) the Zariski closure of G · (e, Lie Z(G,G) (e)) in Cnil (g). Our main
result in this paper is the following:
Theorem. Let e1 , . . . , er be representatives of the distinguished nilpotent orbits in g.
The closed sets C(e1 ), . . . , C(er ) are pairwise distinct and all have the same dimension
equal to dim (G, G). Moreover, Cnil (g) = C(e1 ) ∪ . . . ∪ C(er ).
   A well-known result of Richardson [31] asserts that for p = 0 the whole commuting
variety C(g) := {(x, y) ∈ g × g | [x, y] = 0} of g coincides with the Zariski closure of
G · (Lie T × Lie T ) in g × g where T is a maximal torus in G. As a consequence, this
variety is always irreducible. The case where p is good was recently settled by P. Levy
in his PhD thesis; see also [19]. An important long-standing conjecture asserts that
the variety C(g) is always normal and the ideal defining C(g) is given by the “obvious”
quadratic equations. It is not hard to see that Cnil (g) coincides with the special fibre of
the quotient map C(g) → C(g)//G. For p = 0, a Chevalley Restriction Theorem holds
for C(g) [17]; it says that the affine variety C(g)//G is isomorphic to (Lie T ×Lie T )//W
where the action of the Weyl group W = NG (T )/T on Lie T × Lie T is induced by
the diagonal action of G on g × g. It would be useful to have an analogue of this in
positive characteristic.
   To emphasize the elementary nature of our proof we first consider the case where
p = 0 (this is done in Section 2). In the modular case our argument goes along the
same lines but is technically much more involved (see Section 3). This is mainly due
to inseparability problems and a rather unusual behaviour of the orbit map: in small
characteristic there exist nontrivial commuting sl2 -triples (e1 , h1 , f1 ) and (e2 , h2 , f2 )
in g such that e1 and e1 +e2 are conjugate under the adjoint action of G. The latter is,
in our opinion, the main reason why the irredicibility of Hn is harder to establish for
p small. To tackle this problem we go case-by-case and look closely at the centralisers
of nilpotent elements. For exceptional types, we have to use the computations in [27].
                                               2
   As a motivation for further study, we mention that the nilpotent commuting variety
and its higher analogues play a very important rôle in the cohomology theory of the
                                                         nil
Frobenius kernels of G. It is proved in [37] that CL         (g) is homeomorphic to the
                                                                   2i
spectrum of maximal ideals of the Yoneda algebra             i≥0 H (G2 , k) of the second
Frobenius kernel G2 of G provided that p is sufficiently large. The variety Cnil (g) is
also important for the study of support varieties of modules over reduced enveloping
algebras of g; see [28].
   In Section 4, we prove that the punctual Hilbert scheme Hn is irreducible over any
algebraically closed field; see Corollary 4.1. We also show, in (4.2), that the nilpotent
variety of any finite dimensional restricted Lie algebra is equidimensinal. This result
is then used in (4.3) to estimate the dimension of Cnil (g) in the case where p is a bad
prime for G.

variety of g.

                                  2. The classical case
2.1. Unless otherwise indicated we assume in this section that p = 0. In this case,
g = [g, g] ⊕ z where z is the Lie algebra of the connected centre of G. Thus no
generality will be lost by assuming that G is semisimple. Then G and g are both
defined over Q and hence so is Cnil (g). Therefore, all irredicible components of Cnil (g)
are defined over the field of algebraic numbers. Thus it can be assumed in what
follows that k = C.
   Let e be a nilpotent element in g. Let z(e) denote the centraliser of e in g. By
the Jacobson–Morozov theorem, e can be embedded into an sl2 -triple (e, h, f ) in g.
By the sl2 -theory, all eigenvalues of the semisimple endomorphism ad        L h are integers.
For i ∈ Z we let g(i; h) = {x ∈ g | [h, x] = ix}. Then g =                      i∈Z g(i; h) and
[g(i; h), g(j; h)] ⊆ g(i + j; h) for all i, j ∈ Z.
   Since all nonzero elements in z(e; i) := g(i; h) ∩ z(e) L     are heighest weight vectors
for s := Ce ⊕ Ch ⊕ Cf we have the inclusion z(e) ⊂                  i≥0 g(i; h) (again, by the
sl2 -theory). The Lie algebra z(e;   L0) is nothing but the centraliser of s in g hence
reductive. Therefore, the ideal          i>0 z(e; i) of z(e) coincides with the nilradical of
z(e). As a consequence, the variety
                 N ∩ z(e) = N (z(e; 0)) + nil z(e) ∼    = N (z(e; 0)) × nil z(e)
is irreducible. We denote by C(e) the Zariski closure of G · (e, N ∩ z(e)) in g × g. It
is immediate from the definition that C(e) ⊆ Cnil (g) and C(e) = C((Ad g) e) for any
g ∈ G. The preceding remark shows that each C(e) is irreducible.
Definition. We call a nilpotent element e ∈ g almost distinguished if the centraliser
of e in g is a solvable Lie algebra.
   Note that e is almost distinguished if and only if the connected component of the
centraliser ZG (e) is solvable. Any distinguished nilpotent element in g is therefore
almost distinguished. The converse, however, holds only for simple algebraic groups
of small rank. Looking through the tables in [7, Chap. 13] one finds out that the
exceptional groups for which the converse also holds are the groups of types G2 and
                                              3
F4 . At the other extreme, the Lie algebra sl(n) has only one distinguished nilpotent
orbit while there is a bijection between the almost distinguished nilpotent orbits in
sl(n) and the partitions of n with pairwise distinct parts.
   Since z(e; 0) is reductive, the Lie algebra z(e) is solvable if and only if z(e; 0) co-
incides with the Lie algebra of a maximal torus in ZG (e). From   L this it is immediate
that e ∈ N is almost distinguished if and only if N ∩ z(e) =        i>0 z(e; i).

Proposition 2.1. Each irreducible component of Cnil (g) is of the form C(e) for some
almost distinguished e ∈ g.
Proof. (1) The group GL(2) acts on g × g via
                       
                        α β
                        γ δ
                             · (x, y) = (αx + βy, γx + δy).
As any linear combination of two commuting elements in N is again in N , the variety
Cnil (g) is GL(2)-invariant. As GL(2) is a connected group, it fixes each irreducible
component of Cnil (g). In particular, each irreducible component of Cnil (g) is invariant
under the involution σ : (x, y) 7→ (y, x) on g × g.
(2) Let e1 , . . . es be representatives of the nilpotent orbits in g. Since each C(ei ) is
G-stable we have that Cnil (g) = C(e1 ) ∪ . . . ∪ C(es ). This implies that each irreducible
component of Cnil (g) has the form C(ei ) for some i ≤ s. Let e ∈ N be be such that
C(e) is a component of Cnil (g). By part 1, the set C(e) is then σ-stable.
  Let O denote the G-orbit of e. The map π : (x, y) 7→ x takes G · (e, N ∩ z(e)) onto
O, hence C(e) = G · (e, N ∩ z(e)) onto the Zariski closure O ⊂ g. This shows that
                         N ∩ z(e) = (π ◦ σ)(e, N ∩ z(e)) ⊂ O.
(3) We need to show that the element e is almost distinguished. So suppose the
contrary. Then z(e; 0) contains a nonzero nilpotent element, say e0 . Note that e+e0 ∈
N ∩ z(e) so that e + e0 ∈ O, by part 2. Since z(e; 0) is reductive, e0 can be included
into an sl2 -triple (e0 , h0 , f0 ) in z(e; 0), again by the Jacobson–Morozov theorem. Let
s0 = Ce0 ⊕ Ch0 ⊕ Cf0 . Since s0 ⊆ z(e; 0), the Lie subalgebras s and s0 commute with
each other. This enables us to deduce that (e + e0 , h + h0 , f + f0 ) is an sl2 -triple in
g. Applying the automorphisms exp (λ ad (h + h0 )) ◦ exp (λ−1 ad h) from the adjoint
group of g to e + e0 we deduce that e + C∗ e0 ⊂ O(e + e0 ), the G-orbit of e + e0 .
Then e ∈ O(e + e0 ). As a result, O(e + e0 ) = O showing that e and e + e0 are
G-conjugate. But then the semisimple elements h and h + h0 are G-conjugate too;
see [7, Prop. 5.6.4] for example.
(4) Since g(0; h) is reductive we have that g(0; h) = [g(0; h), g(0; h)] ⊕ z′ where z′ is
the centre of g(0; h). The subspaces z′ and [g(0; h), g(0; h)] are orthogonal to each
other with respect to the Killing form κ of g. Since s0 ⊆ [g(0; h), g(0; h)] and h ∈ z′
it must be that κ(h, h0 ) = 0. On the other hand, κ(h, h) > 0 and κ(h0 , h0 ) > 0 as all
eigenvalues of ad h and ad h0 are in Z. But then
                   κ(h + h0 , h + h0 ) = κ(h, h) + κ(h0 , h0 ) > κ(h, h).
Since h and h + h0 are G-conjugate (see part 3) this is impossible. By contradiction,
the proposition follows.                                                                  
2.2. In a sense, our quest requires that we attach to an arbitrary sl2 -triple (e, h, f ) in
                              ˜ with ẽ distinguished. This will be achieved with the help
g a nice sl2 -triple (ẽ, h̃, f)

an arbitrary reductive group G over k assuming only that p = char k is good for G.
   Fix a maximal torus T in G and let Φ denote the root system of G relative to T .
Let Π = {α1 , . . . , αl } be a basis of simple roots in Φ, Φ+ be the positive system in Φ
associated with Π, and X∗ (T ) be the lattice of cocharacters of T (the latter contains
all coroots α∨). For a subset I ⊆ {1, . . . , l} let LI (resp., PI ) stand for the standard
Levi (respectively, parabolic) subgroup of G corresponding to I. Let ΦI be the root
system of LI relative to T . The set ΠI := {αi | i ∈ I} is then a basis of simple roots
in ΦI .
   Given two subsets I ⊇ J in {1, . . . , l} we denote by PI,J the standard parabolic
subgroup of LI associated with J. Let lI = Lie LI , pI = Lie PI , pI,J = Lie PI,J ,
and uI,J = Lie Ru (PI,J ). Note that PI,J = LJ · Ru (PI,J ) is a Levi decomposition in
PI,J . According to [7, Prop. 5.8.2], for each pair (I, J) with {1, . . . , l} ⊇ I ⊇ J the
inequality
                                                                            
             dim (LI , LI ) ∩ LJ ≥ dim Ru (PI,J )/ Ru (PI,J ), Ru (PI,J )               (1)

holds. A subgroup PI,J is said to be distinguished in LI if
                                                                           
               dim (LI , LI ) ∩ LJ = dim Ru (PI,J )/ Ru (PI,J ), Ru (PI,J ) .

Let P(Π) be the set of all pairs (I, J) with{1, . . . , l} ⊇ I ⊇ J such that PI,J is
distinguished in LI . For (I, J) ∈ P(Π) we denote by O(I, J) the nilpotent orbit in g
containing a Richardson element in uI,J . The main result of the S Bala-Carter theory
(as extended to the present case in [23, 24, 29]) asserts that N = (I,J)∈P(Π) O(I, J).
Thus we may assume in what follows that e is a Richardson element in uI,J .
   Given µ ∈ X∗ (T ) and a µ(k ∗ )-invariant subalgebra m in g we denote by m(i; µ)
the subspace of all x ∈ m such that (Ad µ(t)) x = ti x for all t ∈ k ∗ (here i P

explained in [29, Sect. 2] (for example) there exists a cocharacter λI,J ∈ i∈I Zαi∨
such that

denote the cocharacter λI,J by λJ . Since the orbit (Ad PI,J ) e meets lI (2; λI,J ), by [7,
Prop. 5.8.5], we may (and will) assume that e ∈ lI (2; λI,J ).
   Our next result is implicit in [20]. We give a direct proof for the benefit of the
reader.

Lemma 2.2 (cf. [20, Prop. 1.12]). For each (I, J) ∈ P(Π) the parabolic subgroup PJ
is distinguished in G.

Proof. Following [7, (5.8)] define a function ηJ : Φ → 2Z by
                                      
                                          0   if i ∈ J ,
                         ηJ (αi ) =
                                          2   if i ∈ {1, . . . , l} \ J
                                               5
and extending to arbitrary roots by linearity. Applying [7, Prop. 5.8.1] to PJ ⊂ G
and PI,J ⊂ LI and using the fact that (I, J) ∈ P(Π) we deduce that
                                  
 dim Ru (PJ )/ (Ru (PJ ), Ru (PJ ) = Card {α ∈ Φ | ηJ (α) = 2}
                                    ≥ |Π \ ΠI | + Card {α ∈ ΦI | ηJ (α) = 2}
                                                                                        
                                    = l − |I| + dim Ru (PI,J )/ (Ru (PI,J ), Ru (PI,J )
                                    = l − |I| + dim (LI , LI ) ∩ LJ .
On the other hand, dim (G, G) ∩ LJ = l + |ΦI | = l − |I| + dim (LI , LI ) ∩ LJ . Hence
                                                
               dim Ru (PJ )/ (Ru (PJ ), Ru (PJ ) ≥ dim (G, G) ∩ LJ .
Applying (1) with I = {1, . . . , l} yields that PJ is distinguished in G as desired. 
2.3. From now we assume in this section that k = C and g is semisimple. Let
(I, J) ∈ P(Π) and let e ∈ lI (2; λI,J ) be such that the orbit (Ad PI,J ) e is open in uI,J .
It is immediate from [7, Cor. 5.2.4] that the map
                               ad e : lI (−2; λI,J ) −→ [lI , lI ](0; λI,J )
is bijective. This implies that there are h ∈ Lie λI,J (C∗ ) and f ∈ lI (−2; λI,J ) such
that (e, h, f ) is an sl2 -triple in g. Moreover, αi (h) = 0 for i ∈ J and αi (h) = 2 for
i ∈ I \ J.
   By Lemma 2.2, PJ is a L     distinguished parabolic subgroup of G. Then λJ ∈ X∗ (T )
is well-defined and pJ =          i≥0 g(2i; λJ ). By [7, Prop. 5.8.5], the subspace g(2; λJ )
contains a Richardson element of pJ . We pick such an element and call it ẽ. There
is h̃ ∈ Lie λJ (C∗ ) such that αi (h̃) = 0 for i ∈ J and αi (h̃) = 2 for i ∈ {1, . . . , l} \ J.
Since the map ad ẽ : g(−2; h̃) −→ g(0; h̃) is bijective, by [7, Cor. 5.2.4], there is
f˜ ∈ g(−2; h̃) such that (ẽ, h̃, f)
                                   ˜ is an sl2 -triple in g.
   By construction, g(i; λJ ) = g(i; h̃) and g(i; h̃) ∩ lI = lI (i; h) for all i ∈ Z. From
this it follows that
                [h, h̃] = 0,       [h̃, e] = 2e,     g(0; h̃) = g(0; λJ ) = lJ .            (2)
So the centraliser z(e) is (ad h̃)-invariant. From (2.1) we know that nil z(e) coincides
     L
with i>0 g(i; h) ∩ z(e), hence is also preserved by ad h̃.
Lemma 2.3. The endomorphism ad h̃ acts invertibly on the nilradical nil z(e).
Proof. Indeed, it follows from (2) that
             nil z(e) ∩ Ker ad h̃ = nil z(e) ∩ g(0, h̃) = nil z(e) ∩ lJ
                                                                               
                                  = nil z(e) ∩ lI (0; h) ⊆ nil lI (0; h) ∩ z(e) .
Since the Lie algebra lI (0; h) ∩ z(e) is reductive, by our discussion in (2.1), the RHS
must be zero. The result follows.                                                          
Remark. Using the terminology of the theory of induced orbits [20] one can say that
ẽ is a nice correspondent of e in the G-orbit IndLI , PI (OI (e)) where OI (e) = (Ad LI ) e.
2.4. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over C. Given an ideal I of the
symmetric algebra S(V ∗ ) we denote by gr I the homogeneous ideal of S(V ∗ ) with
the property that g ∈ gr I ∩ S r (V ∗ ) if and only if there is g̃ ∈ I such that g̃ − g ∈
          i   ∗                              ∗
L
    i<r S (V ). As usual, we identify S(V ) with the algebra of polynomial functions
                                                    6
on V . We denote by Z(ϕ1 , . . . , ϕN ) the subset in V consisting of all common zeros
of ϕ1 , . . . , ϕN ∈ S(V ∗ ). Given a Zariski closed set X ⊆ V we let IX be the ideal in
S(V ∗ ) consisting of all polynomial functions vanishing on X and define
                        K(X) := {v ∈ V | f (v) = 0 ∀ f ∈ gr IX }.
The Zariski closed conical set K(X) ⊆ V is known as the associated cone to X. The
proof of our next result will rely on a few elementary properties of the correspondence
X 7−→ K(X). Our reference here is [18, Chap. 1, (4.2)].
   Given an sl2 -triple (e, h, f ) in g we denote by S(h, e) the Zariski closure of the orbit
G · (h, e) in g × g. Identify g × g with g ⊕ g. The next result will play a crucial rôle
in our proof of Baranovsky’s conjecture.
Proposition 2.4. Let (e, h, f ) be an sl2 -triple in g with e distinguished. Then there
            non-conjugate distinguished nilpotent elements e1 , . . . , ek ∈ g such that
exist pairwise
K S(h, e) = C(e1 ) ∪ . . . ∪ C(ek ).
Proof. (1) As [h, e] = 2e, any pair (u, v) ∈ G · (h, e) has the property that [u, v] = 2v.
Therefore, S(h, e) ⊂ {(x, y) ∈ g×g | [x, y]−2y = 0}. In view of [18, Chap. 2, Sect. 4.2,
Theorem 2(b)] this entails that
                                                               
           K S(h, e) ⊂ K {(x, y) ∈ g × g | [x, y] − 2y = 0} ⊆ C(g).                    (3)
Let x1 , . . . , xn and y1 , . . . , yn be coordinate functions on g × {0} and {0} × g, respec-
tively. Let f1 , . . . , fl be free homogeneous generators of the invariant algebra S(g∗ )G .
It is well-known that N = Z(f1 , . . . , fl ). As S(h, e) ⊂ (Ad G) h × N , all polynomial
functions fi (x1 ,. . . , xn ) − fi (h) and fi (y1 , . . . , yn ) on g × g vanish on S(h, e). This
gives K S(h, e) ⊂ N × N . Combining this with (3) one obtains
                                        K S(h, e) ⊆ Cnil (g).
                                                 
                                                                                                (4)
(2) By the definition of S(h, e), the orbit morphism
                                                                       
                   ψ : G −→ S(h, e),          ψ(g) = (Ad g) h, (Ad g) e ,
is dominant. The fibre ψ −1 (ψ(1)) is nothing but the stabiliser of (h, e) in G, a closed
subgroup of G. Its Lie algebra consists of all x ∈ g satisfying [x, h] = [x, e] = 0,
hence coincides with z(e; 0). From (2.1) we know that z(e; 0) is reductive. Because e
is distinguished, we have z(e) ⊂ N ; so it must be that z(e; 0) = {0}. Then ψ −1 (ψ(1))
is finite, implying dim S(h, e) = n = dim g. Since S(h, e) is irreducible we now can
apply [18, Chap.
                     2, Sect. 4.2, Theorem 2(c)] to deduce that all irreducible components
of K S(h, e) have dimension n.
(3) Let e1 , . . . , er be representatives of the distinguished nilpotent orbits in g. Let
O(ei ) denote the nilpotent orbit in g containing ei where 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Since π(C(ei )) =
O(ei ) for all i, the Zariski closed irreducible sets C(e1 ), . . . , C(er ) are pairwise distinct.
By the definition of C(ei ), the morphism
                                                                                   
                ξ : G × z(ei ) −→ C(ei ),      ξ(g, x) = (Ad g) ei, (Ad g) x ,
is dominant. For every x ∈ z(ei ) the fibre ξ −1 (ξ(1, x)) is nothing but the set of all
pairs g, (Ad g)−1 x with g ∈ ZG (ei ). It follows that ξ −1 (ξ(1)) ∼
                   
                                                                   = ZG (ei ) as varieties.
The theorem on the dimension of the fibres of a morphism now gives
          dim C(ei ) = dim G + dim z(ei ) − dim ZG (ei ) = n               (1 ≤ i ≤ r).
                                                7
According to [2, Theorem 2], dim Cnil (g) = n and the n-dimensional irreducible com-
ponents of Cnil (g) are parametrised by the distinguished nilpotent conjugacy classes
in g. In conjunction with the above discussion this yields that C(e1 ), . . . , C(er ) are
exactly the n-dimensional irreducible components of Cnil (g). Combining (4) with our
final remark
           in part 2 we now conclude, after renumbering the ei ’s if necessary, that
K S(h, e) = C(e1 ) ∪ . . . ∪ C(ek ) for some k ≤ r.                                     
2.5. Now all our tools are in place and we are ready for the main result of this section.
Theorem 2.5. Let g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra of dimension n. All ir-
reducible components of the nilpotent commuting variety Cnil (g) are n-dimensional
and the number of components equals the number of distinguished nilpotent conju-
gacy classes in g. More precisely, Cnil (g) = C(e1 ) ∪ . . . ∪ C(er ) where e1 , . . . , er are
representatives of the distinguished nilpotent orbits in g.
Proof. Let e be an almost distinguished nilpotent element in g. In view of Proposi-
tion 2.1 it suffices to show that C(e) ⊆ C(ei ) for some i ≤ r. Since C(e) = C((Ad g) e)
for any g ∈ G no generality will be lost by assuming that e satisfies the condi-
tions of (2.3). We include e into an sl2 -triple (e, h, f ) according to the recipe in
                                                               ˜ with ẽ distinguished (see
(2.3) and then consider the corresponding sl2 -triple (ẽ, h̃, f)
(2.3) for more detail).
                         Thanks to Proposition 2.4 we are then reduced to show that
C(e) ⊆ K S(h̃, ẽ) .
   Let S = S(h̃, ẽ) and L = ZG (h̃). As dim g(0; h̃) = dim g(2; h̃) and z(ẽ; 0) = {0},
the orbit (Ad L) ẽ is open in g(2; h̃). Since S is L-stable and Zariski closed, we then
have h̃, g(2; h̃) ⊂ S. Since g(2; h̃) ∩ lI = lI (2; h), by (2.3), we obtain (h̃, Ce) ⊂ S.
   By construction, h̃ ∈ Lie T ⊆ g(0; h), see (2.3), while from (2.1) we know that
                                                       L
                         Lie Ru (ZG (e)) = nil z(e) =     i>0 z(e; i).

As the group Ru (ZG (e)) is unipotent, the orbit (Ad Ru (ZG (e))) h̃ is Zariski closed in
h̃ + nil z(e). As [nil z(e), h̃] = nil z(e), by Lemma 2.3, it is Zariski open in h̃ + nil z(e)
too, and hence is the whole of h̃ + nil z(e). Applying the operators from Ru (ZG (e))
to (h̃, Ce) ⊂ S̃ we now derive that (h̃ + nil z(e), Ce) ⊂ S. But then
                                             
                      K (h̃ + nil z(e), Ce) = (nil z(e), Ce) ⊂ K(S),
by [18, Chap. 2, Sect. 4.2, Theorem 2(b)]. Since K(S) is G-stable and e is almost
distinguished in g, our discussion in (2.1) yields G · (N ∩ z(e), e) ⊆ K(S). Hence
C(e) ⊆ K(S) and our proof is complete.                                          

                                  3. The modular case
3.1. In this section we assume that p = char k is good for G. Recall that the
derived subgroup (G, G) is simply connected. So there exist simple, simply connected
algebraic k-groups G1 , . . . , Gm such that (G, G) ∼   = G1 × · · · × Gm . Let gi = Lie Gi
                             ′                         ′
where 1 ≤ i ≤ m, and g = Lie (G, G). Then g = g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gm , a direct sum of
restricted Lie algebras. It is well-known that N ⊂ g′ ; see [29, (2.3)] for example.
From this it is immediate that
                    Cnil (g) = Cnil (g′ ) ∼
                                          = Cnil (g1 ) × · · · × Cnil (gm ).
                                              8
Clearly, a nilpotent element x = x1 + · · · + xm with xi ∈ gi is distinguished in g if and
only if each xi is distinguished in gi . Also, C(x) ∼    = CG1 (x1 ) × · · · × CGm (xm ) where
CGi (xi ) denotes the Zariski closure of Gi · (xi , Lie ZGi (xi )) in gi × gi . This observation
reduces computing the irreducible components of Cnil (g) to the case where (G, G) is
a simple algebraic group.
   Until the end of this section we will thus assume that G is either GL(n) or a simple
algebraic group of type different from A. Let X∗ (G) denote the set of all 1-parameter
subgroups µ : k ∗ → G. Given µ ∈ X∗ (G) and i ∈ Z we denote by g(i;           Lµ) the subspace
of all x ∈ g such that (Ad µ(t)) x = ti x for all t ∈ k ∗ . Then g =             i∈Z g(i; µ), that
is each µ ∈ X∗ (G) induces a Z-grading of the restricted Lie algebra g. We denote by
Z(µ) the centraliser of µ in G, a Levi subgroup in G.
   Let e be a nilpotent element in g. As in Section 2, we let z(e) be the centraliser of e
in g, C(e) be the Zariski closure of G·(e, N ∩z(e)), and O(e) be the G-orbit of e. Recall
from (2.2) that O(e) = O(I, J) for some (I, J) ∈ P(Π). More specifically, there is
g ∈ G such that (Ad g) e is a Richardson element of pI,J contained in lI (2; λI,J ). Set
λe := g λI,J g −1 , an element in X∗ (G). Since e ∈ g(2; λe ), the torus λe (k ∗ ) acts on
z(e). For i ∈ Z, set z(e; i) := z(e) ∩ g(i; λe ). According to [16,          Sect. 5] and [29,
Sect. 2], the group Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) is reductive, Lie Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) = z(e; 0), and
                               L                                          L
           z(e) = Lie ZG (e) =    i≥0 z(e; i),       Lie Ru (ZG (e)) =       i>0 z(g, i).

This implies that the nilpotent variety N (z(e; 0))L= N ∩z(e; 0) of z(e; 0) is irreducible.
Hence the varieties N ∩ z(e) ∼  = N (z(e; 0)) ×     i>0 z(e; i) and C(e) are irreducible,
too.
Lemma 3.1. Let e ∈ N be such that N ∩ z(e) ⊂ O(e). Then every nilpotent element
of z(e; 0) is contained in z(e; 0) ∩ [e, g(−2; λe )].
Proof. Given a subvariety X in g ∼ = An and x ∈ X we denote by Tx (X) the tangent
space to X at x. We view Tx (X) as a linear subspace of g. Our assumption on G
implies that the orbit map G → O(e), g 7→ (Ad g) e is separable; see [35, Chap. I,
Sect. 5]. Therefore, Te (O(e)) = Te (O(e)) = [g, e]. Since N ∩ z(e) ⊂ O(e) we then
have Te (N ∩ z(e)) ⊆ [g, e]. By our earlier remarks,
                                   L                                 L            
   Te (N ∩ z(e)) = Te N (z(e; 0) + i>0 z(e; i) = T0 (N (z(e; 0)) ⊕ Te   i>0 z(e; i) .

This yields T0 (N (z(e; 0)) ⊂ [g, e].
   Now let x be an arbitrary element in N (z(e; 0)), a conical variety, and consider the
natural injection ι : Kx ֒→ N (z(e; 0)). Since ι is a closed immersion with (dι)0 (x) = x
we get x ∈ T0 (N (z(e; 0)). But then x ∈ [g, e] ∩ z(e; 0) = z(e) ∩ [e, g(−2; λe )] as
claimed.                                                                               
3.2. We say that a nilpotent element e ∈ g is almost distinguished if the connected
component of ZG (e) is a solvable group. For p = 0, this is consistent with our
definition in (2.1).
Proposition 3.2. Let G be as above and let e ∈ N be such that N ∩ z(e) ⊂ O(e).
Then e is almost distinguished in g.
Proof. Our arguments will rely on various case-by-case considerations. Let V be a
finite dimensional vector space over k.
                                                9
(1) Suppose G = GL(V ). This case is particularly interesting for us since we have in
mind an application to the punctual Hilbert scheme Hn over k. Let V = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vs
be a decomposition of V into a direct sum of indecomposable ke-modules such that
dim V1 ≥ · · · ≥ dim Vs . The partition of dim V associated with e is nothing but
(dim V1 , dimV2 , . . . , dim Vs ).                   	
   Let I = i ∈ {1, . . . , s − 1} | dim Vi = dim Vi+1 . Suppose I 6= ∅ and let j be the
smallest integer in I. Let d = dim Vj = dim Vj+1 and M = Vj ⊕ Vj+1. Let v1 , . . . , vd
and w1 , . . . , wd be bases of Vj and Vj+1 such that e(vd ) = e(wd ) = 0 and e(vi ) = vi+1 ,
e(wi ) = wi+1 for i < d. There is z ∈ gl(M) such that z(wd ) = 0, z(vi ) = wi for
1 ≤ i ≤ d and z(wi ) = vi+1 for 1 ≤ i < d. For i > d, put vi = wi = 0. Then
ze(vi ) = wi+1 = ez(vi ) and ze(wi ) = vi+2 = ez(wi ) for all i. In other words, the
endomorphisms e|M and z commute. Note that z acts on M as a nilpotent Jordan
block of order 2d. There is ẑ ∈ gl(V ) such that ẑ|M = z and ẑ|Vi = e|Vi for all
i 6∈ {j, j + 1}. By construction, ẑ ∈ N ∩ z(e) and the partition of dim V associated
with ẑ is not dominated by that of e. Applying [10] we now deduce that ẑ 6∈ GL(V ) e.
Since this contradicts our assumption on e it must be that I = ∅.
   As a result, all parts of the partition of dim V associated with e are distinct. But
then e is almost distinguished in g, by [35, Chap. IV, Cor. 1.8(i)]. So the proposition
holds in the present case.
(2) We now consider the case where G is a group of type B, C or D. Since p is good for
G we have p 6= 2. Assume that dim V ≥ 2 and let Ψ be a nondegenerate bilinear form
on V such that Ψ(u, v) = (−1)κ Ψ(v, u) for all u, v ∈ V , where κ ∈ {0, 1}. Let G(Ψ)
be the closed subgroup of SL(V ) consisting of all g ∈ SL(V ) with Ψ(g(u), g(v)) =
Ψ(u, v) for all u, v ∈ V . Then

          g(Ψ) := {x ∈ sl(n) | Ψ(x(u), v) + Ψ(u, x(v)) = 0 for all u, v ∈ V }

is the Lie algebra of G(Ψ). It is well-known that G is isogenic to G(Ψ) for a suitable
choice of V and Ψ, and g ∼  = g(Ψ) as restricted Lie algebras. We thus may identify g
with g(Ψ) and view our e ∈ N as a nilpotent endomorphism of V .
   Let (n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ ns ) be the partition of dim V associated with e. According
to [35, Chap. IV, (2.19)] there is a direct sum decomposition V = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vs with
dim Vi = ni for all i, such that
     1. each Vi is e-stable and e acts on Vi as a nilpotent Jordan block of order ni ;
     2. if ni + κ is odd, then Ψ is nondegenerate on Vi and Ψ(Vi , Vk ) = 0 for k 6= i;
     3. if ni + κ is even, then Ψ vanishes on Vi ×Vi and there exists a unique i∗ = i±1
        such that ni∗ = ni , Ψ is nondegenerate on Vi ⊕ Vi∗ , and Vk is orthogonal to
        Vi ⊕ Vi∗ for k 6∈ {i, i∗ }.
For i ≤ dim V we denote by r(i) the number of k with nk = i. Let I1 (respectively,
I2 ) be the set of all i ∈ {1, . . . , s} such that ni + κ is odd (respectively, even) and
r(ni ) ≥ 3 (respectively, r(ni ) ≥ 2). Put I = I1 ∪ I2 and suppose I 6= ∅. Let j be the
smallest integer in I and set d := nj = dim Vj .
(a) First suppose that d + κ is odd. Then r(d) ≥ 3 implying dim Vj = dim Vj+1 =
dim Vj+2 = d. As d + κ is odd, the subspaces Vj , Vj+1 and Vj+2 are orthogonal to
each other relative to Ψ. Let M = Vi ⊕ Vj+1 ⊕ Vj+2 . For t ∈ {0, 1, 2}, there is a basis
                                             10
m1,t , . . . , md,t of Vj+t such that e(md,t ) = 0, e(mi,t ) = mi+1,t for 1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, and
                   Ψ(mi,t , mk,t ) = (−1)i−1 δi, d+1−k      (1 ≤ i, k ≤ d);
                                                                      √
see [35, Chap. IV, (2.19)]. For 1 ≤ i ≤ d, define ui := √12 (mi,0 + −1 mi,2 ), vi := mi,1 ,
                     √
wi := − √12 (mi,0 − −1 mi,2 ) and let ui = vi = wi = 0 for all i > d. Let U and W be
the linear spans of the ui ’s and wi ’s, respectively. By construction, these subspaces
are totally isotropic with respect to Ψ. Furthermore, M = U ⊕ Vj+1 ⊕ W and Ψ
vanishes on (U + W ) × Vj+1 . Finally, Ψ(ui, wk ) = −(−1)i−1 δi, d+1−k = −Ψ(vi , vk ) for
all i, k ≤ d. There is z ∈ gl(M) such that z(ui ) = vi , z(vi ) = wi and z(wi ) = ui+1
for all i. It acts on M as a nilpotent Jordan block of order 3d. Similar to part 1
of this proof one checks that the endomorphisms e|M and z commute. Next observe
that Ψ(z(ui ), vk ) = Ψ(vi , vk ) = −Ψ(ui , wk ) = −Ψ(ui , z(vk )) and
    Ψ(z(wi ), wk ) = Ψ(ui+1, wk ) = −(−1)i δi+1,d+1−k = (−1)d+κ−i δi+1,d+1−k
                     = (−1)k+κ δk+1,d+1−i = −(−1)κ Ψ(uk+1, wi) = −Ψ(wi , z(wk )).
Combined with our earlier remarks this shows that the endomorphism z is skew-
adjoint with respect to Ψ|M ×M . Property 2 of our direct sum decomposition now
ensures that there exists ẑ ∈ g = g(Ψ) such that ẑ|M = z and ẑ|Vi = e|Vi for all
i 6∈ {j, j + 1, j + 2}. By construction, ẑ ∈ N ∩ z(e) and the partition of dim V
associated with ẑ is not dominated by that of e. So ẑ 6∈ GL(V ) e, by [10]. But then
ẑ 6∈ G e, a contradiction.
(b) Now suppose d + κ is even. This case is harder as we do not have much room for
manoeuvre here (indeed, it may happen that r(d) = 2). Set M := Vj ⊕Vj ∗ = Vj ⊕Vj+1 .
    By property 3 of our decomposition, the subspaces Vj and Vj+1 are totally isotropic
with respect to Ψ. According to [35, Chap. IV, (2.19)] there exist bases v1 , . . . , vd
and v1′ , . . . , vd′ of Vj and Vj+1 respectively, such that e(vd ) = e(vd′ ) = 0, e(vi ) = vi+1 ,
e(vi′ ) = vi+1
             ′
                  for 1 ≤ i < d, and
                      Ψ(vi , vk′ ) = (−1)i−1 δi, d+1−k     (1 ≤ i, k ≤ d).
Since d + κ is even we have Ψ(vi′ , vk ) = −Ψ(vi , vk′ ). For i > d, put vi = vi′ = 0.
   Let A be the algebra k[X]/(X d ) and x be the image of X in A. Denote by C the
centraliser of e|M in End(M). Since e|M acts on M as a direct sum of two Jordan blocks
                                                                                  ∼
of order d, there exists an isomorphism of associative algebras ϕ : C −→ Mat2 (A)
such that ϕ(e|M ) = diag (x, x). Specifically, if φhk (x) is the (h, k)th entry of ϕ(c) for
c ∈ C, then c(v1 ) = φ11 (e) v1 + φ21 (e) v2′ and c(v1′ ) = φ12 (e) v1 + φ22 (e) v2′ .
   Now let z ∈ C be such that ϕ(z) = xx2 1x . We claim that z is skew-adjoint
                                                                                        ′
with respect to Ψ|M ×M . To prove this we first observe that z(vi ) = vi+1 + vi+2         and
    ′     ′
z(vi ) = vi+1 + vi for all i. Then
             Ψ(z(vi′ ), vk′ ) = Ψ(vi , vk′ ) = −Ψ(vi′ , vk ) = −Ψ(vi′ , z(vk′ )),
                                  ′
             Ψ(z(vi ), vk ) = Ψ(vi+2   , vk ) = −Ψ(vi+2 , vk′ ) = −Ψ(vi , z(vk )),
             Ψ(z(vi ), vk′ ) = Ψ(vi+1 , vk′ ) = −Ψ(vi′ , vk+1 ) = −Ψ(vi , z(vk′ )),
hence the claim. Next observe that
                                         2      
                2     x 1          x 1       2x 2x
            ϕ(z) =             ·          =            = 2x ϕ(z).
                      x2 x         x2 x      2x3 2x2
                                                11
Easy induction on r now shows that ϕ(z)r = (2x)r−1 ϕ(z) for all r ∈ N. But then
                                                 
          d        d−1   x 1         d−1   0 xd−1
      φ(z) = (2x)                = 2                  6= 0,      ϕ(z)d+1 = 0,
                         x2 x              0   0

which implies that z d 6= 0 and z d+1 = 0. So z is nilpotent and at least one part of the
partition of dim M associated with z equals d + 1. Property 3 of our decomposition
ensures that there exists ẑ ∈ g with ẑ|M = z and ẑ|Vi = e|Vi for all i 6∈ {j, j + 1}.
It is clear from the discussion above that ẑ ∈ N ∩ z(e) and the partition of dim V
associated with ẑ is not dominated by that of e. Arguing as at the end of part 2a of
this proof we now deduce that ẑ 6∈ G e, a contradiction.
   When combined, parts 2a and 2b show that I = ∅. In other words, ni + κ is odd
and r(ni ) ≤ 2 for all i ≤ s. But then [35, Chap. IV, (2.25)] yields that the connected
centraliser ZG (e)◦ is solvable (one should keep in mind that the group SO(2) is a
torus). Thus e is almost distinguished when G is of type B, C or D.
(3) Now suppose G is a group of type E. We are going to rely on some results proved
in [27]. Adopt Dynkin’s labelling of nilpotent orbits; see [7, Chap. 13]. Let GC be a
simple algebraic group over C of the same type as G and let eC be a nilpotent element
in Lie GC whose GC -orbit has the same labelling as O(e) ⊂ g. It follows from the
main result in [33] (and also from [29, Sect. 2]) that
            dim z(e) = dimC z(eC ),      dim z(e; 0) = dimC (z(eC )/nil z(eC )).
So we can use Elashvili’s tables [7, pp. 401–407] for computing dim z(e) and dim z(e; 0).
(a) Suppose e is not almost distinguished in g (then e is not distinguished in g either).
Since the connected component of ZG (e)/Ru (ZG (e)) ∼   = Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) is not a torus,
by our assumption on e, and since z(e; 0) = Lie Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) , by [16, Sect. 5] and
[29, Sect. 2], it must be that N (z(e; 0)) 6= {0}. Then z(e; 0) ∩ [e, g(−2; λe )] 6= {0}, by
Lemma 3.1. So the linear map (ad e)2 : g(−2; λe ) −→ g(2; λe ) is not bijective. The
computations in [27] now show that p ∈ {5, 7} and e is regular in Lie L where L is a
Levi subgroup of G with a factor of type Ap−1 . There are eight such cases in all, and
in each of them we have e[p] = 0.
   If G is of type E6 (respectively, E7 ) and O(e) is labelled by A4 × A1 , then z(e; 0)
is 1-dimensional (respectively, 2-dimesional); see [7, pp. 402, 404]. Combined with
our earlier remarks this implies that the connected component of Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) is
a torus. Hence O(e) is not of the above type. If O(e) is labelled by Ap−1 and G is
not of type E7 when p = 7, then z(e) meets the orbit labelled by Ap−1 × A1 , call it
O1 . Elashvili’s tables along with our earlier remarks assure that dim O1 > dim O(e).
Then N ∩ z(e) 6⊂ O(e), hence O(e) is not of that type.
   These observations settle the case where G is of type E6 and leave us with just
three orbits, one in characteristic 5 and two in characteristic 7. Unfortunately, the
conclusion of Lemma 3.1 does hold for these orbits and no further reduction is readily
available. So we have to work harder here, and our plan will be to exhibit, in each of
the remaining cases, an element z ∈ N ∩z(e) with z [p] 6= 0. Since e[p] = 0 and the [p]th
power map on g is a G-equivariant morphism, this will imply that N ∩ z(e) 6⊂ O(e).
We adopt Bourbaki’s numbering of simple roots [5, Tables I–IX] and the notation of
[27]. The group scheme (SL2 )H from [27, (2.26)] will be denoted by G.
                                             12
(b) Suppose p = 7 and G is of type E8 . Then O(e) is labelled       P by A6 × A1 . So we may
assume that L = LJ , where J = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, and e = i∈J eαi (note that I = J
in this case). From [27, (2.27)] we know that the projective G-module P0,0 is a direct
summand of both gJ (−2) and gJ (2). So z(e; 0) ∩ gJ (±2) 6= {0}. On the other hand,
dim z(e; 0) = 3, by [7, p. 406]. Then z(e; 0) is a 3-dimensional reductive Lie algebra
with N (z(e; 0)) 6= {0}. Therefore, z(e; 0) ∼    = sl(2) as restricted Lie algebras.
   Obviously, Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) contains Z(LJ ), the centre of LJ . Combined with the
preceding remark this shows that there exist nonzero e0 ∈ gJ (2) ∩ g(0; λe ), f0 ∈
gJ (−2) ∩ g(0; λe ) and h0 ∈ Lie Z(LJ ) such that (e0 , h0 , f0 ) is an sl2 -triple in z(e; 0).
Since each gJ (ℓ) with ℓ 6= 0 is an irreducible LJ -module, by [27, (2.27)], the endo-
morphism ad h0 acts on gJ (ℓ) as ℓ id.
   By [27, (2.27)], we have that gJ (±4) ∼        = Vp−1,0 as G-modules. In particular, the
subspaces z(e) ∩ gJ (±4) are 1-dimensional. Fix a nonzero a ∈ z(e) ∩ gJ (4), a multiple
of eα̃ , and put z = f0 + a. We claim that z ∈ N and z [7] 6= 0.
   For m1 , . . . , ms ∈ Z+ and n1 , . . . , ns ∈ N, set
           [am1 f0n1 · · · ams f0ns a] := (ad a)m1 (ad f0 )n1 · · · (ad a)ms (ad f0 )ns (a).
To prove the claim we first observe that a ∈ g(6; λe ) is a primitive vector of weight
4 for z(e; 0). Hence [f04 a] 6= 0, by a standard sl2 -argument. Since [f04 a] belongs to
gJ (−4) ∩ z(e), a 1-dimensional subspace, it must be that
                                        where δ = 2 4 52 4 3 2 1 .
                          [f04 a] ∈ k ∗ e−δ                                                       (5)
                                             [7]
  By [15, Chap. V, Sect. 7], z [7] = a[7] + f0 + 6i=1 si (a, f0 ) where
                                                 P

                ad(ta + f0 )6 (a) = 6i=1 isi (a, f0 )ti−1
                                      P
                                                               (∀ t ∈ k).
Since gJ (6) is zero, we have [af0 a] = [a2 f03 a] = 0. Then [af02 a] = 0, by the Jacobi
identity. It follows that
      ad(ta + f0 )6 (a) = ad(ta + f0 )3 ([f03 a]) = ad(ta + f0 )2 (t[af03 a] + [f04 a]).          (6)
As gJ (−6) is zero, [f05 a] = 0 necessarily holds. Since both [a2 f04 a] and [af0 af03 a]
belong to gJ (4) ∩ g(18; λe ), we also have [a2 f04 a] = [af0 af03 a] = 0. So (6) yields
     ad(ta + f0 )6 (a) = t[ta + f0 , [af04 a] + [f0 af03 a]] = t([f0 af04 a] + [f02 af03 a]).     (7)
Now let F = ad f0 and A = ad a. Since [f05 a] = 0 we have (ad F )5 (A) forcing
          (F 5 A − 5F 4 AF + 10F 3 AF 2 − 10F 2AF 3 + 5F AF 4 − AF 5 )(a) = 0.
Together with our observations above this gives [f0 a4 f0 a] = 2[f02 af03 a]. By (7),
             ad(ta + f0 )6 (a) = = 3t[f02 af03 a] = −4t[f02 af03 a] = 2s2 (a, f0 )t.
So si (a, f0 ) = 0 for i 6= 2. Also, f0 = a[7] = 0, because z(e; 0) ∼
                                      [7]
                                                                    = sl(2) as restricted
Lie algebras. It follows that
                     z [7] = s2 (a, f0 ) = −2[f02 af03 a] ∈ gJ (−2) ⊂ N .                         (8)
According to [5, Table VIII], α̃ − δ is a root. So (5) yields [af04 a] 6= 0. This, in turn,
implies that [af03 a] 6= 0. Indeed, otherwise
               [af04 a] = [[af0 ], [f03 a]] = [f0 , [[a, f0 ], [f02 a]]] = [f0 , [af03 a]] = 0,
                                                     13
a contradiction (here we used the Jacobi identity and the fact that [af02 a] = 0). Since
[e0 , [af03 a]] ∈ k[af02 a], we obtain that [af03 a] is a primitive vector of weight 2 for z(e; 0).
But then [f02 af03 a] 6= 0, by a standard sl2 -argument. Now(8) shows that z ∈ N and
z [7] 6= 0, as claimed. This settles the present case.
(c) Retain the assumptions of part 3b. Since G is of type E8 , it is both adjoint and
simply connected. In particular, there is a unique involution τ ∈ T ⊂ G with the
property that that (Ad τ ) x = (−1)ℓ x for all x ∈ gJ (ℓ) and all ℓ ∈ Z. Let Gτ = ZG (τ )
and let gτ be the fixed point algebra of Ad τ . By a result of Steinberg, Gτ is a
connected reductive group; see [35, Chap. II, § 4]. By [4, Chap. 3, Sect. 9], we have
gτ = Lie Gτ .
    Clearly, T ⊂ Gτ . Straightforward calculation shows that dim gτ = 136. Since
all maximal root subsystems in the root system of type E8 are well-known (see [5,
Chap. VI, § 4, Exercise 4] for example), one finds out without difficulty that Gτ is a
semisimple group of type E7 × A1 . Let G1 and G2 be the simple components of Gτ of
type E7 and A1 , respectively, and gi = Lie Gi . The Lie algebras g1 and g2 are simple,
hence gτ = g1 ⊕ g2 , a direct sum of restricted Lie algebras.
                                                                                  [7]   [7]
    Given x ∈ gτ we let xi be the component of x in gi . Then x[7] = x1 + x2 . Since
g2 ∼
                                       [7]
     = sl(2), we also have that x2 = 0 for any x ∈ gτ ∩ N . Note that e, z ∈ gτ . The
                                      [7]            [7]
preceding remark shows that e1 = 0 and z1 6= 0. Obviously, [e1 , z1 ] = 0.
    Next observe that PJ ∩ Gτ is a parabolic subgroup of Gτ and LJ is a Levi subgroup
in it. From this it follows that LJ ∩ G1 is a Levi subgroup of type A6 in G1 . Since
e is regular in lJ , its component e1 must be regular in lJ ∩ g1 = Lie (LJ ∩ G1 ).
By the discussion above, z1 6∈ (Ad G1 ) e1 . This settles our second remaining case in
characteristic 7.
(d) Now suppose p = 5. Then G is of type E7 and O(e) is labelled by A4 ×                PA2 ; see
part 3a. So we may assume that L = LJ , where J = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}, and e = i∈J eαi .
Since α̃ = 2 3 42 3 2 1 , we have MJ,+ = gJ (1) ⊕ gJ (2) ⊕ gJ (3). Using [5, Table VI] we
observe that gJ (1), gJ (2) and gJ (3) are irreducible modules over (LJ , LJ ) ∼      = SL5 (k) ×
SL3 (k) with highest weights ω3J + ω7J , ω2J + ω6J and ω1J , respectively. As a consequence,
                       2
             gJ (1) ∼
                    = (∧ N5 ) ⊗ N3 ,        gJ (2) ∼
                                                   = N5∗ ⊗ N3 ,        gJ (3) ∼
                                                                              = N5 .
As in [27, (2.27)] this yields that each gJ (ℓ) with ℓ 6= 0 is a projective G-module.
Direct calculation based on [5, Table VI] and [27, Lemma 2.9] gives m1 (e) = 8,
m2 (e) = 6, m3 (e) = 4 showing that 2p − 2 is the largest λe -weight of MJ,+ . Then
[27, (2.26)] says that all indecomposable summands of the G-modules MJ,± are of the
form Vp−1,0 or Pm,0 for m ≤ p − 2. Moreover, P0,0 occurs in gJ (±1).
   On the other hand, dim z(e; 0) = 3, by [7, p. 406]. Arguing as in part 3b we
now obtain that there are nonzero e0 ∈ gJ (1) ∩ g(0; λe ), f0 ∈ gJ (−1) ∩ g(0; λe )
and h0 ∈ Lie Z(LJ ) such that (e0 , h0 , f0 ) is an sl2 -triple in z(e; 0). Since each gJ (ℓ)
with ℓ 6= 0 is LJ -irreducible, ad h0 acts on gJ (ℓ) as 2ℓ Id (because e0 ∈ gJ (1) and
[h0 , e0 ] = 2e0 ). As in part 3b, z(e; 0) ∼
                                           = sl(2) as restricted Lie algebras.
   Since (gJ (−3))∗ ∼   = Jg (3)  ∼
                                  = 5N    as (LJ , LJ )-modules and e is regular nilpotent
                                    ∼
in lJ , it must be that gJ (±3) = Vp−1,0 as G-modules. In particular, the subspaces
z(e)∩gJ (±3) are 1-dimensional. Fix a nonzero a ∈ z(e)∩gJ (3), an element in g(4; λe ),
and put z = f0 + a. We claim that z ∈ N and z [5] 6= 0.

                                             [5]
  By [15, Chap. V, Sect. 7], z [5] = a[5] + f0 + 4i=1 si (a, f0 ) where
                                                 P

                ad(ta + f0 )4 (a) = 4i=1 isi (a, f0 )ti−1
                                      P
                                                             (∀ t ∈ k).
Since gJ (5) is zero, we have [af0 a] = 0. Then [af02 a] = 0, by the Jacobi identity.
Furthermore, [af03 a] = 0 as gJ (3) ∩ g(8; λe ) is zero. Hence
                   ad(ta + f0 )4 (a) = ad(ta + f0 )([f03 a]) = [f04 a] = s1 (a, f0 ).
                                                                       [5]
This means that si (a, f0 ) = 0 for i > 1. Since a[5] = f0 = 0, we now get
                                  z [5] = [f04 a] ∈ gJ (−1) ⊂ N .                                 (9)
Since a   is a primitive vector of weight 1 for z(e; 0), the element (ad e0 ) ([f04 a]) is a 2

nonzero   multiple of [f02 a]. Due to (9) we are thus reduced to show that [f02 a] 6= 0.
  Since   βJ5 = 1 2 21 1 1 1 and b5J = 10, it follows from [27, Lemma 2.9] and [5, Table VI]
that the subspace gJ (−1) ∩ g(0; λe ) is spanned by e−γ1 , . . . , e−γ6 where
                            001111                     011111                     111110

                                                              ,          γ6 =       1
                                                                                         .
          P7
Let β =      i=1   αi , a positive root. We may assume without loss of generality that
      e−γ1 = [eα3 , [eα1 , e−β ]], e−γ2 = [eα2 , [eα1 , e−β ]], e−γ3 = [eα2 , [eα7 , e−β ]]
      e−γ4 = [eα7 , [eα1 , e−β ]], e−γ5 = [eα6 , [eα7 , e−β ]], [eα4 , e−γ6 ] = [eα1 , e−γ5 ].
Let f0 = 6i=1 si e−γi where si ∈ k. Recall that [e, f0 ] = 0 and e = i6=5 eαi . Since
             P                                                                 P

[eα2 , eα3 ] = [eα3 , eα7 ] = [eα2 , eα6 ] = 0, this yields s1 + s2 = s1 + s4 = s3 + s5 = 0.
Since eα1 , eα2 , eα7 pairwise commute we also have s2 +s3 +s4 = 0. Since [eα1 , eα6 ] = 0,
our choice of e−γ6 yields s4 + s5 + s6 = 0.
   Together these relations show that the si ’s are all nonzero. Since gJ (3) ∼     = Vp−1,0 as
                                 ∗
G-modules, we have a ∈ k eα̃ . In view of [5, Table VI] we have
                             [f0 , eα̃ ] ∈ {±s3 e 1 2 3 2 1 1 ± s5 e 1 2 3 2 2 1 }.
                                                      2                   1

Using [5, Table VI] one now observes without difficulty that [f02 a] is a nonzero linear
combination of e 0 1 2 1 1 1 , e 1 1 1 1 1 1 , e 1 1 2 1 1 0 . This proves the proposition in the case
                      1              1               1
where G is of type E.
(4) Next suppose G is of type F4 . Then G = Aut(g). Let G̃ be a simply connected
group of type E6 and g̃ = Lie G̃. As in [27, (2.28)], we regard g as a subalgebra of g̃.
More precisely, we assume that g = g̃σ where σ is the involution in Aut(g̃) swapping
e±αi and e±α−i+7 for i = 1, 2 and fixing e±αi for i = 2, 4. Note that σ permutes the
set of indices {1, 2, . . . , 6}.
   Suppose e is conjugate to a regular nilpotent element in a standard Levi subalgebra
of g. Then a G-conjugate of e is regular in a standard Levi subalgebra lJ˜ of g̃ such
that J˜σ = J;˜ see [27, (2.28)]. Hence it can be assumed in the present case that
     P
e = i∈J˜ eαi . Let λ̃ denote the image of λJ,˜ J˜ ∈ X∗ (G̃) under the natural embedding
X∗ (G̃) ֒→ X∗ (Aut(g̃)). It is easy to see that σ fixes λ̃.
   The construction of optimal 1-parameter subgroups in [29, Sect. 2] shows that we
can take as λe the image of λ̃ in X∗ (G) = X∗ (Aut(g̃σ )). Since lJ˜ is σ-stable and p > 3,
the root system of lJ˜ has no components of type Ap−1 . Calculations in [27] then yield
                                                      15
that the map (ad e)2 : g̃(−2; λ̃) −→ g̃(2; λ̃) is bijective. It follows that so is the map
(ad e)2 : g(−2; λe ) −→ g(2; λe ).
  If e is not of the above type, then it follows from [27, (2.28)] and the proof of [27,
Lemma 2.7] that the map (ad e)2 : g(−2; λe ) −→ g(2; λe ) is bijective. Arguing as in
part 3a we now obtain that in any event e is almost distinguished in g.
(5) Finally, suppose G is of type G2 . We may assume that e is not distinguished in g.
Note that e 6= 0 and e is not conjugate to a long root vector in g (otherwise z(e) would
contain a regular nilpotent element in g). By [7, p. 401], we are now left with the orbit
labelled by Ã1 . So suppose e = eα2 . Then I = J = {2} and we may assume further
that λe = α2∨ . It is easily seen that in this case z(e; 0) ∼
                                                            = sl(2) and dim g(±2; λe ) = 1.
But then Lemma 3.1 shows that this case is impossible, completing the proof of the
proposition.                                                                             
3.3. Proposition 3.2 enables us now to establish a modular version of Proposition 2.1.
Proposition 3.3. Under the present assumption on G, each irreducible component
of Cnil (g) is of the form C(e) where e is almost distinguished in g.
Proof. By [13], the nilpotent orbits in reductive Lie algebras are finite in number re-
gardless of p. Therefore, our arguments in parts 1 and 2 of the proof of Proposition 2.1
apply to any reductive Lie algebra. They show that each irreducible component of
Cnil (g) is of the form C(e) where e ∈ N is such that N ∩ z(e) ⊂ O(e). According to
Proposition 3.2, each such e is almost distinguished in g.                            
3.4. Recall that all our observations in (2.2) are valid in the present setting. With the
notation of (2.2), we pick (I, J) in P(Π) and let e ∈ lI (2; λI,J ) be such that the orbit
(Ad PI,J ) e is open in uI,J . By Lemma 2.2, PJ is a distinguished parabolic
                                                                       L         subgroup
of G; so λJ ∈ X∗ (T ) is well-defined. By [7, Prop. 5.8.5], pJ =         i≥0 g(2i; λJ ) and
the subspace g(2; λJ ) contains a Richardson element of pJ . As in (2.3), we pick such
an element and call it ẽ. It follows from the definition of λJ that
                     g(i; λJ ) ∩ lI = lI (i; λI,J )     (∀ i ∈ Z).                     (10)
In particular, e ∈ g(2; λJ ) so that Int λJ (k ∗ ) acts on ZG (e). As a result, Ad λJ (k ∗ )
acts on Lie Ru (ZG (e)) and on each weight space g(i; λI,J ) of λI,J (k ∗ ).
Lemma 3.4. The torus Ad λJ (k ∗ ) has no zero weight on Lie Ru (ZG (e)).
Proof. It follows from [16, Sect. 5] and [29, Sect. 2] that
                                          L
                       Lie Ru (ZG (e)) =     i>0 g(i; λI,J ) ∩ z(e),

while from the definition of λJ it is immediate that g(0; λJ ) = lJ ⊆ lI . Then
                                            L
             Lie Ru (ZG (e)) ∩ g(0; λJ ) =         g(i; λI,J ) ∩ lJ ∩ z(e)
                                            Li>0
                                         ⊆     i>0 lI (i; λI,J ) ∩ lJ = {0},

in view of (10) and the equality lJ = lI (0; λI,J ). The result follows.                  
3.5. Given a linear algebraic group H we denote by U(H) the unipotent variety of H
and put U = U(G). Note that U ⊂ (G, G). Since the sl2 -theory has its limitations,
we have to modify our constructions in (2.4): associated cones do not work for p
small. This goal will be achieved in (3.6) where we introduce a group analogue
                                               16
of K(S(h̃, ẽ)). The latter will be linked with Cnil (g) by means of a G-equivariant
isomorphism between U and N .
   In fact, we need the G-equivariant isomorphism between U and N introduced in [3].
This isomorphism, call it η, is defined in loc. cit. as follows: If G = GL(V ), one just
puts η(u) = u − 1 for all u ∈ U. If G is not of type A, then g is a simple Lie algebra.
In this case one picks a finite dimensinal rational representation ρ : G → GL(W )
with ker ρ ⊆ Z(G) such that the trace form (X, Y ) 7−→ tr (dρ)e (X) ◦ (dρ)e (Y ) on g
is nondegenerate; see [35, Chap. I, Lemma 5.3]. One then identifies g with its image
(dρ)(g). By the choice of ρ, there is a subspace M ⊂ gl(W ) such that gl(W ) =
g ⊕ M and [g, M] ⊆ M. Specifically, M is the orthogonal complement of g with
respect to the trace form on gl(W ). Finally, one takes for η the restriction of pr1 ◦ ρ
to U where pr1 : gl(W ) ։ g is the first projection. According to [3, Cor. 9.3.4],
         ∼
η : U −→ N is a G-equivariant isomorphism of algebraic varieties. Hence so is the
map η × idN : U × N −→ N × N .
   We now define X := {(u, x) ∈ U × N | (Ad u) x = x}, a closed subset in U × N ,
and denote by η̃ the restriction of η × idN to X.

Lemma 3.5. The map η̃ is a G-equivariant isomorphism between X and Cnil (g). For
any e ∈ N it maps (Ru (ZG (e)), e) onto (Lie Ru (ZG (e)), e).

Proof. Let (u, e) ∈ X. Then (Ad u) e = e forcing ρ(u)eρ(u)−1 = e (recall that we
identify g with (dρ)(g)). Thus ρ(u) commutes with e. Write ρ(u) = x + m with
x ∈ g and m ∈ M. Then x = η(u) ∈ N and 0 = [e, ρ(u)] = [e, x] + [e, m]. Hence
[e, η(u)] = 0. This shows that η̃(X) ⊆ Cnil (g).
   As a consequence, η̃ sends (U ∩ ZG (e), e) to (N ∩ z(e), e). From [16,
                                                                         Sect. 5] and
[29, Sect. 2] we know that U ∩ ZG (e) is isomorphic to U Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) × Ru (ZG (e)).
Our discussion in (3.1) shows that

                 N ∩ z(e) ∼
                                                 
                          = N Lie Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) × Lie Ru (ZG (e))

is an irreducible variety.
                              Since Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) is a reductive group, the varieties
N Lie Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) and U Z(λe ) ∩ ZG (e) have the same dimension. This implies
that dim U ∩ ZG (e) = dim N ∩ z(e).
   Since η × idN is an isomorphism of varieties, it maps the closed set (U ∩ ZG (e), e)
onto a closed subset of (N ∩ z(e), e) of the same dimension. The irreducibility of
(N ∩ z(e), e) now yields that η̃ maps (U ∩ ZG (e), e) onto (N ∩ z(e), e). Since this
holds for any e ∈ N , it must be that η̃(X) = Cnil (g). But then η̃ : X −→ Cnil (g) is
a G-equivariant isomorphism of varieties.                                    L
   Let P (λe ) be the parabolic subgroup of G with Lie algebra p(λe ) :=        i≥0 g(i; λe ).
It follows from [21, LemmaL      28] that η maps Ru (P (λe )) onto Lie Ru (P (λe )). Note
that Lie Ru (P (λe )) =     i>0    λe ). Since η̃ maps (U ∩ ZG (e),
                                 g(i;                                e) onto (N ∩ z(e), e),
it maps Ru (P (λe )) ∩ ZG (e), e onto Lie Ru (P (λe )) ∩ z(e), e . Combined with [16,
Sect. 5] or [29, Sect. 2] this yields that η̃ maps (Ru (ZG (e)), e) onto (Lie Ru (ZG (e)), e)
as desired.                                                                                
Remark. Let C unip (G) := {(x, y) ∈ U × U | xy = yx} be the unipotent commuting
variety of G. Since both ρ(g) and M are stable under all Int ρ(g) with g ∈ G, the
                                              17
argument used in the proof of Lemma 3.5 also shows the map idU × η induces a G-
equivariant isomorphism between C unip (G) and X. As a result, the varieties C unip (G)
and Cnil (g) are G-equivariantly isomorphic.
3.6. The group G acts on G × N via g · (x, n) = ((Int g) x, (Ad g) n) fot all g, x ∈ G
and n ∈ N . Given a distinguished nilpotent element e ∈ g we denote by Y(λe , e) the
Zariski closure of G · (λe (k ∗ ), e) in G × N . By the definition of Y(λe , e), the morphism
            ν : G × k ∗ −→ Y(λe , e),           (g, t) 7−→ g λe (t) g −1 , (Ad g) e ,
                                                                                   

is dominant. It follows that Y(λe , e) is anirreducible variety. Since k is infinite, there
is t0 ∈ k ∗ such that ZG (λe ) = ZG λe (t0 ) . The fibre ν −1 (ν(1, t0 )) = ν −1 (λe (t0 ), e) is
nothing but StabG (λe (t0 ), e), the stabiliser of (λe (t0 ), e) in G. In view of [4, Chap. III,
(9.1), (9,4)] and the choice of t0 , we have
                                                        
      Lie StabG (λe (t0 ), e) ⊆ z(e) ∩ Lie ZG λe (t0 ) = z(e) ∩ g(0; λe ) = z(e; 0).
   Since e is distinguished, the reductive part of ZG (e)◦ = (Z(G)·Z(G,G)(e))◦ coincides
with Z(G)◦ , the connected centre of G. Combining this with [16, Sect. 5] and [29
Sect. 2] one derives that z(e; 0) coincides with z(g), the centre of g. By our assumption
on G, we have z(g) = {0} unless G is of type A, in which case dim z(g) = dim Z(G)◦ =
                                          ◦
1. This implies that StabG (λe (t0 ), e) = Z(G)◦ . Consequently, dim ν −1 (ν(1, t0 )) =
dim Z(G)◦ . On the other hand, it is easy to see that dim ν −1 (ν(g, t)) ≥ dim Z(G)◦
for all (g, t) ∈ G × k ∗ . Applying the theorem on the dimensions of the fibres of a
morphism we now get
             dim Y(λe , e) = dim G − dim Z(G)◦ + 1 = dim (G, G) + 1.                        (11)
   Now let l = rk (G, G) and let ρ1 , . . . , ρl be the fundamental representations of G
(when G = GL(V ), we take as ρi the ith exterior power of the vector representation
of G). For 1 ≤ i ≤ l, define the regular invariant function χi on G by setting
χi (g) = tr ρi (g) for all g ∈ G. Define χ0 ∈ k[G]G by setting, for all g ∈ G,
                                  
                                    det g when G is of type A,

                                    1         otherwise.
Define the morphism F : Y(λe , e) −→ Al+1 by letting
                                                     
            F (g, n) = χ0 (g), χ1(g), . . . , χl (g)   ∀ (g, n) ∈ Y(λe , e),
and denote by Y0 (λe , e) the fibre F −1 (F (1, 0)).
Proposition 3.6. Y0 (λe , e) is a closed subset in X and all irreducible components of
Y0 (λe , e) have dimension equal to dim (G, G).
Proof. (1) First note that (G, G) = {g ∈ G | χ0(g) = 1}. Together with [36, (3.4),
Cor. 4] this implies that U = {g ∈ G | χi(g) = χi (1) for all i} (one should take into
account that the group (G, G) is simply connected). It follows that Y0 (λe , e) ⊆ U ×N .
On the other hand, the set R := {(g, x) ∈ G × N | (Ad g) x ∈ kx} is Zariski closed
and G-stable in G × N . As (λe (k ∗ ), e) ⊂ R, this yields Y(λe , e) ⊆ R. If u ∈ U, then
1 is the only eigenvalue of Ad u. Hence (U × N ) ∩ R ⊆ X forcing
                               Y0 (λe , e) ⊆ (U × N ) ∩ R ⊆ X.
(2) Let C denote the Zariski closure of {F (λe (t), 0) | t ∈ k ∗ } in Al+1 . Since λe : k ∗ → G
is a nontrivial homomorphism, C is an affine curve. Since all χi are G-invariant, F
                                               18
maps Y(λe , e) onto a Zariski open subset of C, say C0 . Clearly, C0 is a curve on its
own and the morphism F : Y(λe , e) −→ C0 is surjective. As Y(λe , e) is irreducible,
we now combine [32, Chap. I, § 6, Theorem 7] with (11) to deduce that all irreducible
components of F −1 (F (1, 0)) = Y0 (λe , e) have dimension equal to dim (G, G). This
completes the proof.                                                                

3.7. Now we are ready for the main result of this section.
Theorem 3.7. Let G be a connected reductive group over k and assume that p =
char k is a good prime for G. Let g = Lie G and n = dim (G, G). Then all irreducible
components of Cnil (g) are n-dimensional and their number equals the number of dis-
tinguished nilpotent conjugacy classes in g. Moreover, each irreducible component of
Cnil (g) has the form C(e) for some distinguished nilpotent element e ∈ g.
Proof. (1) As explained in (3.1), it can be assumed in proving this theorem that G
is either GL(n) or a simple algebraic group of type different from A. Let e be an
almost distinguished nilpotent element in g. Thanks to Proposition 3.3 it suffices to
show that C(e) ⊆ C(e′ ) for some distinguished e′ ∈ N . Since C(e) = C((Ad g) e) for
any g ∈ G we may assume that e is as in (3.4); in particular, e is Richardson in uI,J
for some (I, J) ∈ P(Π). We now pick a distinguished ẽ ∈ N following the procedure
described in (3.4) and take as λẽ the 1-parameter subgroup λJ .
(2) We claim that λẽ (k ∗ ) Ru (ZG (e)), e ⊂ Y(λẽ , ẽ). To that end we let b1 , . . . , bm be
                                             
the weights of (Ad λẽ )(k ∗ ) on Lie Ru (ZG (e)). By Lemma 3.4, none of them is zero.
                   ∗
It follows that kreg := {t ∈ k ∗ | bi (Ad λẽ (t)) 6= 1 for all i} is a nonempty Zariski open
subset in k ∗ . We pick any v ∈ kreg ∗
                                         and set s = λẽ (v), Ỹ = Y(λẽ , ẽ), L = ZG (λẽ ). By
[29, Sect. 2], the orbit (Ad L) ẽ is open in g(2; λẽ ). Since Ỹ is L-stable and Zariski
closed, we then have (s, g(2; λẽ )) ⊂ Ỹ. Since e ∈ g(2; λẽ ) by our discussion in (3.4),
we deduce that (s, e) ∈ Ỹ.
   Let U(s) denote the centraliser of s in Ru (ZG (e)). As s is semisimple and Ru (ZG (e))
is a connected unipotent group,s U(s) is connected too; see [4, Chap. III, (9.3)]. Since
Lie U(s) = Lie Ru (ZG (e)) , by [4,Chap. III, (9.4)], and since bi (Ad s) 6= 1 for all
i, it must be that U(s) = {1}. As s normalises the unipotent group Ru (ZG (e)), the
orbit Int Ru (ZG (e)) s is Zariski closed in s Ru (ZG (e)). By the preceding remark, it
has the same dimension as s Ru (ZG (e)). The irreducibility of s Ru (ZG (e)) now yields
                                                              ∗                 ∗
(s Ru (ZG (e)), e) ⊂ Ỹ. Since this holds for all v ∈ kreg      , we get (λẽ (kreg ) y, e) ⊂ Ỹ for
                                        ∗                  ∗
all y ∈ Ru (ZG (e)). But then (λẽ (k ) y, e) = (λẽ (kreg ) y, e) ⊂ Ỹ for all y ∈ Ru (ZG (e)),
and the claim follows.
                                                            
(3) Proposition 3.6 now shows that Ru (ZG (e)), e ⊂ Ỹ ∩ X = Y0(λẽ , ẽ). Combined
with Lemma 3.5 this implies that (Lie Ru (ZG (e)), e) ⊂ η̃ Y0 (λẽ , ẽ) ⊆ Cnil (g) and all
irreducible components of the Zariski closed set η̃ Y0(λẽ , ẽ) have dimension n.
   Let Z be an irreducible component of η̃ Y0 (λẽ , ẽ) containing (Lie Ru (ZG (e)), e).
Then Z ⊆ C(e′ ) for some e′ ∈ N ; see Proposition 3.3. By our discussion in (3.1), the
variety N (z(e′ )) = N ∩ z(e′ ) is irreducible. So it is immediate from the definition of
C(e′ ) that the morphism
            ξ : G × N (z(e′ )) −→ C(e′ ),           ξ(g, x) = (Ad g) e′, (Ad g) x ,
                                                                                      
                                                19
is dominant. For every  x ∈ N (z(e′ )) the fibre ξ −1 (ξ(1, x)) is nothing but the set of all
pairs g, (Ad g)−1 x with g ∈ ZG (e′ ). It follows that ξ −1(ξ(1)) ∼   = ZG (e′ ) as varieties.
                    
The theorem on the dimension of the fibres of a morphism in conjunction with our
discussion in (3.1) now gives
                   dim C(e′ ) = dim G + dim N (z(e′ )) − dim ZG (e′ )
                               = dim G + dim N (z(e′ )) − dim z(e′ )
                               = dim G − rk Z(λe′ ) ∩ ZG (e′ )
                                                               

                               = dim (G, G) − rk Z(λe′ ) ∩ Z(G,G) (e′ ) .
                                                                       

As dim Z = n, we get rk Z(λe′ ) ∩ Z(G,G) (e′ ) = 0. As ZG (e′ ) = Z(G) · Z(G,G) (e′ ), our
                                               
discussion in (3.1) shows that the group Z(G,G) (e′ )◦ must be unipotent.
   As a result, e′ is distinguished in g and Z = C(e′ ), by dimension reasons. Since e is
almost distinguished, our remark in (3.1) yields that N (z(e; 0)) = {0} and N ∩ z(e) =
                                          ′
L
   i>0 z(e; i) = Lie Ru (ZG (e)). As C(e ) is G-stable, we then have G · (N ∩ z(e), e) ⊆
    ′                       ′
C(e ) forcing C(e) ⊆ C(e ). This completes the proof.                                   

                     4. Applications and concluding remarks
4.1. Let S be a smooth projective surface over k and let Hilbn (S) be the Hilbert
scheme parametrising the 0-dimensional subschemes of S of length n. The scheme
Hilbn (S) is known to be smooth and projective; see [8, 9]. Let Symn (S) denote the n-
fold symmetric power of S, the geometric quotient of S n by the permutation action of
Sn . By assigning to any 0-dimensional subscheme of S its support with multiplicities
one obtains a map
                            wn : Hilbn (S) −→ Symn (S)
called the Hilbert-Chow morphism. According to [8, 9], this map provides a natural
                              n                             n
desingularisation     of Sym
                          P (S). If z is a point of−1Sym (S) representing   Q the effective
                             ni = n, then the fibre wn (z) is isomorphic to i Hilbni OS, si
         P
0-cycle ni [si ] with
              r
where Hilb OS,s is the punctual Hilbert scheme parametrising the ideals of colength
r in the local ring OS,s .
   For any s ∈ S the scheme (Hilbr OS,s )red is isomorphic to the (reduced) Hilbert
scheme Hr = Hilbr k[[x, y]] parametrising the ideals of colength d in the ring of
formal power series k[[x, y]]; see [14, Chap. 1]. This shows that the punctual Hilbert
schemes Hd with r ≤ n serve as the building blocks for all fibres of the Hilbert-Chow
morphism.
   Let m be the maximal ideal of k[[x, y]] and A = k[[x, y]]/mr , a finite dimensional
local algebra over k. Let Grr (A) denote the Grassmannian of all k-subspaces of
codimension r in A. By [14, Chap. 1], any ideal I of colength r in k[[x, y]] contains
mr and the map I 7→ I/mr identifies Hr with a closed subset of Grr (A). The algebraic
variety structure on Hr is given by this identification.
   Now let V is an r-dimensional vector space over k and g = gl(V ). Observe that
G = GL(V ) acts on Cnil (g) × V by g · (a, b; v) = (gag −1, gbg −1; g(v)) for all g ∈ G and
all (a, b; v) ∈ Cnil (g) × V . Let U be the Zariski open subset in Cnil (g) × V consisting
of all (a, b; v) such that ai bj (v) with i, j ∈ Z+ span V . Clearly, U is G-stable. As
observed in [22, 2], the morphism ψ : U −→ Grr (A) assigning to (a, b; v) ∈ U the
                                              20
point {φ ∈ A | φ(a, b)(v) = 0} on Grr (A), maps U onto Hr . Moreover, GL(V ) acts
freely on U and the fibres of ψ are exactly the GL(V )-orbits on U.
   It is immediate from Theorems 2.5 and 3.7 that Cnil (g) × V is an irreducible variety
of dimension r 2 + r − 1. Then so is U being open dense in Cnil (g) × V . Combining
the theorem on the dimension of the fibres of a morphism with the discussion above
we now obtain the following:
Corollary 4.1. If k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic p ≥ 0, then the
punctual Hilbert scheme Hr is irreducible over k and dim Hr = r − 1.
   This corollary generalises earlier results by Briançon [6] for p = 0, Iarrobino [14]
for p > n, and Basili [1] for p ≥ n/2. In conjunction with an observation in [22, (1.2)]
it also shows that Hr is isomorphic (as a reduced scheme) to the closure in Grr (A) of
the (r − 1)-dimensional family of principal ideals
         J = A x − (t1 y + t2 y 2 + · · · + tr−1 y r−1) | (t1 , t2 , . . . , tr−1 ) ∈ Ar−1 .

4.2. In this subsection we assume that k is an algebraically closed field of character-
istic p > 0. Let L be a finite dimensional restricted Lie algebra over k with pth power
map x 7→ x[p] . We denote by N (L) the nilpotent variety of L, the set of all x ∈ L
          N
with x[p] = 0 for N ≫ 0. It is immediate from Jacobson’s formula [15, Chap. V,
Sect. 7] that the map π : L → L, x 7→ x[p] , is a morphism given by homogeneous
polynomial functions on L of degree p.
   Recall that an element x ∈ L is semisimple if it lies in the restricted subalgebra of
L generated by x[p] . Let Lss denote the set of all semisimple elements of L. Using
the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition in L it is easy to observe that Lss coincides with
π N (L) for N ≫ 0. We define
          e(L) := min {r ∈ Z+ | π r (W ) ⊆ Lss for some open dense W ⊆ L}.
  Recall that a restricted subalgebra t ⊆ L is called toral (or a torus) if the pth power
map of L is injective on t. By [15, Chap. V, Sect. 8], any torus t in L is abelian and
spanned by its subset ttor := {t ∈ t | t[p] = t}. We define
                         MT (L) := max {dim t | t is toral in L}.
   Note that MT (L) = 0 if and only if L = N (L), while from the main results of
[25] it follows that e(L) = 0 if and only if L possesses a toral Cartan subalgebra (see
also [26, Theorem 1]). Let n = dim L, e = e(L), s = MT (L), and let v1 , . . . , vn be
a basis of L. According to [26, Theorem 2], there exist homogeneous polynomials
       . . , ψs−1 ∈ k[X1 , . . . , Xn ] with deg ψi = ps+e − pi+e and the property that for any
ψ0 , . P
x = ni=1 xi vi one has
                                        s+e   Ps−1           [p]i+e
                                    x[p] =       i=0 ψi (x) x       .                      (12)
We view ψ0 , . . . , ψs−1 as polynomial functions on L.
Theorem 4.2. The following are true:
   1. ψi (x[p] ) = ψi (x)p for all x ∈ L and all i ≤ s − 1.
   2. N (L) coincides with the set of all common zeros of ψ0 , . . . , ψs−1 in L.
   3. All irreducible components of N (L) have dimension n − s.
                                              21
Proof. (1) Let gi+1 = ψip − ψi ◦ π where 0 ≤ i ≤ s − 1. Then gi+1 is a polynomial
                                                                   s+e+1     Ps−1                i+e+1
function on L. Applying π to both sides of (12) we get x[p]              =     i=0  ψi (x)p x[p]
                                                    s+e+1      Ps−1             [p]i+e+1
while substituting in (12) x by x[p] we get x[p]           =               [p]
                                                                  i=0 ψi (x ) x          . Hence
                      Ps            [p]e+i
                        i=1 gi (x) x        = 0           (∀ x ∈ L).                             (13)
                                                 n
For r ∈ N and x ∈ L, write π r (x) =
                                                P
                                                 i=1 πr,i (x) vi where πr,i is a homogeneous
                                          r
polynomial function on L of degree p . As explained in [26, § 1] the matrix
                              πe,1         πe,2     ···      πe,n
                                                                     
                         πe+1,1         πe+1,2 · · · πe+1,n 
                               .
                                ..           ..                ..     
                                             .                 .     
                               πe+s−1,1 πe+s−1,2 · · · πe+s−1,n
has rank s. It follows that there is an open dense subset U ⊂ L with the property
         e      e+1             e+s−1
that u[p] , u[p] , . . . , u[p]       are linearly independent for all u ∈ U. Let W be an
open dense set in L with π e (W ) ⊂ Lss . Note that for each u ∈ W the linear span
       j                                                   e+1   e+2         e+s
of u[p] with j ≥ e is a torus. It follows that u[p] , u[p] , . . . , u[p]        are linearly
independent whenever u ∈ U ∩ W . So (13) shows that all gi vanish on U ∩ W . As
U ∩ W is open dense in L, we get ψi ◦ π = ψip for all i ≤ s − 1.
(2) Let Z denote the set of all common zeros of ψ0 , . . . , ψs−1 in L. It is immediate
from (12) that N (L) ⊇ Z. On the other hand, if x ∈ N (L), then
                         N            N
                  ψi (x)p = ψi (x[p] ) = ψi (0) = 0              (0 ≤ i ≤ s − 1)
provided N ≫ 0. Hence Z = N (L) implying that each irreducible component of
N (L) has dimension ≥ n − s, by the affine dimension theorem. If N (L) had a
component of dimension > n − s, then it would intersect nontrivially with any s-
dimensional torus in L (again by the affine dimension theorem). But this is impossible
as no nonzero element in L can be both nilpotent and semisimple. Thus all irreducible
components of N (L) are of dimension n − s.                                             
Remark. It is conjectured in [26] that the variety N (L) is always irreducible. This
conjecture is still open; it is not clear at present how to approach it without using
the structure theory of finite dimensional restricted Lie algebras.
4.3. We are going to apply Theorem 4.2 for estimating the dimension of Cnil (g) in a
more general setting. We assume in this subsection that k is an algebraically closed
field of characteristic p > 0 and G is a connected reductive k-group (so we allow p to
be a bad prime from now on). We adopt the notation introduced in Sections 2 and 3.
   Let e1 , . . . , em be representatives of the nilpotent G-orbits in g; these orbits are
finite in number, by [13]. Then Cnil (g) = C(e1 ) ∪ . . . ∪ C(em ), as before, but in the
present case there is no guaranty that the C(ei )’s are all irreducible. However, the
nilpotent variety N of g is still irreducible, by [4, Chap. IV, (14.16)]. Combined with
[13] this implies that N contains a unique open G-orbit. Let ereg be a representative
of this orbit.
Proposition 4.3. The following are true:
   1. For any e ∈ N the variety C(e) is equidimensional and
                 dim C(e) = dim G − dim ZG (e) + dim z(e) − MT (z(e)).
                                                 22
     2. C(ereg ) is an irreducible component of Cnil (g) and
                 dim C(ereg ) = dim G − rk G + dim z(ereg ) − dim z(g).
Proof. (1) Let M1 , . . . , Ms be the irreducible components of N (z(e)). By Theo-
rem 4.2(3), dim Mi = dim z(e) − MT (z(e)) for all i ≤ s. Let M̃i denote the Zariski
closure of G · (e, Mi ) in g × g. Then C(e) = M̃1 ∪ . . . ∪ M̃s . It follows that each
irreducible component of C(e) has the form M̃j for some j ≤ s. The map
                                                                        
              ξ : G × Mj −→ M̃j ,       (x, m) 7−→ (Ad x) e, (Ad x) m) ,
is a dominant morphism of algebraic varieties. The fibre ξ −1 (ξ(g, a)) consists of
all (x, m) ∈ G × Mj with g −1 x ∈ ZG (e) and (Ad x−1 g) a = m. From this it is
immediate that ξ −1 (ξ(g, a)) ∼= Tran (a, Mj ) := {z ∈ ZG (e) | (Ad z) a ∈ Mj }. Since
ZG (e) permutes the components M1 , . . . , Ms , the connected component ZG (e)◦ acts
on Tran (a, Mj ) by left translations. Since ZG (e)◦ has finite index in ZG (e), it follows
that Tran (a, Mj ) and ZG (e) have the same dimension. As a result, dim ξ −1 (ξ(g, a)) =
dim ZG (e). The theorem on the dimension of the fibres of a morphism now gives
                dim M̃j = dim G + dim Mj − dim ZG (e)
                        = dim G − dim ZG (e) + dim z(e) − MT (z(e)),
proving the first part of the proposition. As dim ZG (ereg ) = rk G, we also obtain
             dim C(ereg ) = dim G − rk G + dim z(ereg ) − MT (z(ereg )).                  (14)
(2) Let T be a maximal torus in G and t = Lie T . Let {α1 , . . . , αl } be a basis of
simple roots in the root system of G relative to T . According to [16, Prop. 4.14], it
can be assumed that ereg = eα1 + . . . + eαl where eαi are simple root vectors in g (the
argument in [16] is based on [7, Prop. 5.8.5]) which is applicable in any characteristic).
There is a cocharacter λreg ∈ X∗ (T ) such that αi (λreg (t)) = t2 for all i and all t ∈ k ∗ .
It is easy to see that g(0; λreg ) = t. For r ∈ Z, we set z(ereg ; r) = z(ereg ) ∩ g(r; λreg ).
Then z(ereg ; 0) consists of all x ∈ t with (dαi )e (x) = 0 for all i. Since any root γ is
a Z-linear combination of simple roots, the root function (dγ)e ∈ t∗ is an Fp -linear
combination of the root functions (dαi )e . It follows that any root function (dγ)e
vanishes on z(ereg ; 0) ⊆ t. Since t is abelian, this implies that z(ereg ; 0) ⊆ z(g). On
the other hand, decomposing z(g) into weight spaces with respect to T one observes
without difficulty that z(g) ⊆ t. This yields z(ereg ; 0) = z(g).
   As a result, for any r ∈ Z the set Zr := {ad x | x ∈ z(ereg ; r)} consistsSof nilpotent
endomorphisms of g. Since [Zi , Zj ] ⊆ Zi+j for all i, j ∈ Z, the union r∈Z Zr is a
weakly closed nilset in End g. Applying Jacobson’s theorem on weakly closed nilsets,
see [15, Chap. II, § 2, Theorem 1], we now obtain that the associative subalgebra gen-
erated by the Zi ’s is nilpotent. But then z(ereg ) is a (restricted) nilpotent subalgebra
of g, by Engel’s theorem. It follows that the set z(ereg )ss is central and, moreover, a
unique maximal torus in z(ereg ). Since z(ereg )ss is stable under Ad λreg (k ∗ ), it must
be that z(ereg )ss = z(g). As a consequence,
                               MT (z(ereg )) = dim z(g).                                  (15)
(3) Thanks to (14) and (15) we are now reduced to show that C(ereg ) is a component
of Cnil (g). Let us first show that C(ereg ) is irreducible. Let z = z(ereg )/z(g) and
let β : z(ereg ) ։ z denote the canonical homomorphism.Using the Jordan-Chevalley
                                              23
decomposition in z(ereg ) and our final remarks in part 2 one easily observes that β
induces a bijective morphism
                                N (z(ereg )) → z. The latter, in turn, induces a bijective
morphism P N (z(ereg )) −→ P(z) of        projective varieties. Since P(z) is obviously
irreducible, so must be P N (z(ereg )) , by [32, Chap. I, § 6, Theorem 8]. But then
N (z(ereg )) is irreducible as well, and hence so is C(ereg ).
   Let Z be an irreducible component of Cnil (g) containing C(ereg ). By part 1, Z =
G · (e, Mj ) where e ∈ N and Mj is a component on N (z(e)). It follows that the first
projection pr1 : g × g → g, (x, y) 7→ x takes Z to the Zariski closure of the G-orbit
of e. On the other hand, pr1 (C(ereg )) contains the G-orbit of ereg , an open subset
in N . This shows that e is G-conjugate to ereg . Therefore, Mj = N (z(ereg )) and
Z = C(ereg ), completing the proof.                                                      
                                          nil
Remark. It is quite possible that C (g) is equidimensional for any connected re-
ductive group G and for any p. If this is the case, then dim Cnil (g) = dim C(ereg ),
by Proposition 4.3. In [34, Sect. 2], Springer essentially computed dim z(ereg ) for
any semisimple group G in bad characteristic. In view of Proposition 4.3(2), this
computation yields a close formula for dim C(ereg ).
   Proposition 4.3 also shows that if Cnil (g) is equidimensional, then
           dim z(e) − dim ZG (e) − MT (z(e)) ≤ dim z(ereg ) − rk G − dim z(g)
for any e ∈ N . Thus proving the equidimensionality of Cnil (g) in bad characteristic
would have important implications for the detailed study of the adjoint action of G.
