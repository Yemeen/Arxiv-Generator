                                                           Let g be a classical Lie superalgebra of type I or a Cartan-type Lie superal-
                                                       gebra W(n). We study weight g-modules using a method inspired by Mathieu’s
                                                       classification of the simple weight modules with finite weight multiplicities over
                                                       reductive Lie algebras, [M]. Our approach is based on the fact that every simple
                                                       weight g-module with finite weight multiplicities is obtained via a composition
                                                       of a twist and localization from a highest weight module. This allows us to
                                                       transfer many results for category O modules to the category of weight mod-
                                                       ules with finite weight multiplicities. As a main application of the method we
                                                       reduce the problems of finding a g0 -composition series and a character formula
                                                       for all simple weight modules to the same problems for simple highest weight
                                                       modules. In this way, using results of Serganova we obtain a character for-
                                                       mula for all simple weight W(n)-modules and all simple atypical nonsingular
                                                       sl(m|1)-modules. Some of our results are new already in the case of a classical
                                                       reductive Lie algebra g.

                                             1         Introduction
                                             Let g be a classical Lie superalgebra of type I, or let g =W(n). The problem of finding
                                             the characters of all finite dimensional simple g-modules M has been known for more
                                             than 20 years to be very interesting and challenging. Many mathematicians, including
                                             J. Bernstein, V. Kac, D. Leites, I. Penkov, and V. Serganova have contributed to its
                                             solution, until it was completely solved by Serganova for g = gl(m|n). Recently the
                                             infinite dimensional highest weight modules over Lie superalgebras have attracted
                                             attention, as new methods of J. Brundan and V. Serganova (see [B], [S1], and [S2])
                                             have opened new perspectives for the study of these modules.
                                                 All modules considered in the present paper are weight modules, i.e. are isomor-
                                             phic to the direct sum of their weight spaces. Our main goal is to study quotients of
                                             parabolically induced g-modules M, in particular all simple weight g-modules with fi-
                                             nite weight multiplicities. Let a be a reductive Lie subalgebra of g0 containing a fixed
                                             Cartan subsuperalgebra h of g, such that all elements a ∈ a, a ∈ / h, act injectively on

M. We focus our attention on the d-module structure of M, where d = g0 , d = a or
in the case when M is not simple, d = g. We show that the d-module structure of M
is described up to a partially finite enlargement (see section 4 for the definition of a
partially finite enlargement) by the d-module structure of a quotient Mh of a Verma
module, i.e. a highest weight module. The correspondence M 7→ Mh is a basic tool in
Mathieu’s classification of all simple weight modules over reductive Lie algebras. This
correspondence is a specific version of M. Duflo’s theorem stating that the annihilator
of every simple module over a simple Lie algebra is the annihilator of a certain highest
weight module with the same central character. For Lie superalgebras g of type I and
modules with bounded weight multiplicities the correspondence M 7→ Mh is studied
in [G] where the “finite enlargement phenomenon” occurs when d = a = g0 . The aim
of the present paper is twofold - to study this phenomenon at a larger scale and to
obtain an explicit character formula for M provided that such a formula is known for
Mh .
    One of our main tools is the localization of weight modules determined by a com-
muting set of roots, introduced in [M]. Section 2 is devoted to the basic properties
of localization. The results in this section hold for arbitrary weight modules, which
gives us a hope that eventually the method will provide new results for weight mod-
ules with infinite weight multiplicities, in particular for Harish-Chandra modules. In
Section 3 we study (g, a)-coherent families. Our results generalizes Mathieu’s theory
of coherent families for reductive Lie algebras and its extension in [G] (where a = g0 )
for Lie superalgebras of type I. We show that every simple weight g-module with finite
weight multiplicities M has a unique semisimple (g, a)-coherent extension Ea(M). As
in the Lie algebra case, Ea(M) contains a D-highest weight submodule with respect to
any basis D of the root system ∆ of g. In the fourth section we find a necessary and
sufficient condition for M to be d-semisimple module and apply it to the particular
case g = osp(2|n). Our main result is contained in the last section. We write down a
character formula for every simple weight g-module with finite weight multiplicities
in terms of composition multiplicities of Verma g-modules in the category O. For
the case of a reductive Lie algebra g this result is a new more explicit version of a
character formula of Mathieu. In the general case, i.e. for Lie superalgebras g of type
I and g =W(n), we combine our results with a set of results of Serganova in [S1],
[S2], and [S3]. As a corollary we establish a character formula for all simple weight
g-modules except those which have singular atypical central character for the cases
of g = sl(m|1) and g = osp(2|n). Finally, for g =W(n), a character formula for all
simple weight g-modules is provided.

2     Localization of Weight Modules
2.1    Notations and Conventions
The ground field K is algebraically closed and of characteristic zero. The super-
script ∗ indicates dual space. The sign ⊂ stands for proper inclusion of sets, and Z+
(respectively, Z− ) denotes the set of positive (resp., negative) integer numbers.
    Let k = k0 ⊕ k1 be a finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra, and U(k) be the universal
enveloping algebra of k. Fix a Cartan subsuperalgebra hk = (hk)0 ⊕ (hk)1 of k, i.e. a
self-normalizing nilpotent subsuperalgebra. Then (hk)0 is a Cartan subsuperalgebra
of k0 and (hk)1 is the maximal subspace of k1 on which (hk)0 acts nilpotently (see
[Sch], [PS2]). By ∆k = (∆k)0 ∪ (∆k)1 ⊂ (hk)∗0 we denote the set of roots of k, and
by Qk := Z∆k we denote the root lattice of k. In this paper we consider a fixed Lie
superalgebra g for which hg = (hg)0 and g0 = g′0 ⊃        ′′
                                                      + g , where g
                                                          0
                                                                     ′
                                                                     0 is a reductive Lie
                               ′′
algebra containing hg and g0 is a nilpotent Lie algebra. Set h := hg, ∆ := ∆g, and
Q := Qg, and let W denote the Weyl group of g′0 .
    A g-module M is a weight module if M = ⊕λ∈h∗0 M λ , where M λ := {m ∈ M | h ·
m = λ(h)m}. The space M λ is the weight space of weight λ, and dim M λ is the
multiplicity of M λ . The support of M is the set supp M := {λ ∈ h∗0 | M λ 6= 0}. The
weight space U(g)0 of weight 0 equals the supercentralizer of h0 in U. U := U(g) is
a weight g-module with respect to the adjoint action of g. In the rest of the paper
the term k-module will be used as an abbreviation for a weight k-module for any Lie
superalgebra k.
    Fix a parabolic subsuperalgebra p of g which contains h and assume that p admits
a vector space decomposition p = u ⊕ a, where u is the nilradical of p, and a is a
reductive Lie subalgebra of p ∩ g′0 with h ⊆ a. Denote by u− the nilradical of the
parabolic subalgebra opposite to p. Then g = u− ⊕ a ⊕ u. If S is an a-module
put Mp(S) := Indgp S, where S is considered as a p-module with trivial action of u.
Suppose that the support of S lies in a single K ⊗ Qa-coset u = λ + K ⊗ Qa. Let
Zp(S) be the sum of all g-submodules of Mp(S) having trivial intersection with S (M
                                                             µ
is the maximal g-module Zp(S) included in ⊕µ∈u    / Mp(S) , see Lemma 2.3 in [DMP]).
Set Lp(S) := Mp(S)/Zp(S). Corollary 2.4 in [DMP] implies that S is simple if and
only if Lp(S) is simple.
    Finally, if k ⊆ l are Lie superalgebras, and P is an l-module, denote by H 0 (k, P )
the space of k-invariant vectors in P .

2.2    Definitions and properties of the twisted localization
For the rest of the paper a will be a reductive Lie algebra, and d will be a Lie
superalgebra, such that a ⊆ d ⊆ g. The results obtained in this section will be
applied to the cases d = a, d = g0 , and d = g. For every α ∈ ∆a, let hα be the
corresponding coroot, let eα be a fixed generator of aα , and let fα ∈ a−α be defined
by the equality [eα , fα ] = hα . Let Γa ⊂ ∆a be a commuting set of roots which is a basis
of Qa, and let FΓa be the multiplicative subset of U generated by {fα | α ∈ Γa}. Since


                                            3
FΓa satisfies Ore’s localizability conditions, the localization UΓa of U with respect to
FΓa is well-defined. For details about this localization we refer the reader to Section
4 in [M].
     A d-module M will be called Γa-injective (respectively, Γa-bijective) if fα acts
injectively (resp., bijectively) on M for each α ∈ Γa. If M is a simple, the condition
that fα acts injectively (resp., bijectively) on M is equivalent to the condition that
the operator fα : M λ → M λ−α is injective (resp., bijective) for some λ ∈ supp M,
see Corollary 3.4 in [DMP]. Let M be a Γa-injective weight d-module. The FΓa -
localization of M is MFΓa := UFΓa ⊗U M, where UFΓa is the localization of U with
respect to FΓa . There is a d-module injection i : M → MFΓa which allows us to
identify every d-submodule N of M with its image i(N). It is clear that NFΓa = N if
and only if N is Γa-bijective.
     If Γa = {α1 , ..., αl }, the l-parametric set of twisted automorphisms of UFΓa , Θ :
   l
K × UFΓa 7→ UFΓa , is defined by the formula
                                    X
      Θ(x1 ,...,xl ) (u) :=                         (xi11 ) . . . (xill ) ad(fα1 )i1 . . . ad(fαl )il (u) fα−i1 1 . . . fα−il l ,
                              0≤i1 ,...,il ≤N (u)


where (xi ) := x(x − 1)...(x − i + 1)/i! for x ∈ K and i ∈ Z+ ∪ {0}. The sum is
well-defined, since, for every u ∈ UFΓa , there exists a nonnegative integer N(u) such
that ad(fαj )N (u)+1 (u) = 0 for j = 1, 2, .., l. Note that in the particular case when
(x1 , x2 , ..., xl ) ∈ Zl we have Θ(x1 ,...,xl ) (u) = fαx11 . . . fαxll u fα−x
                                                                              l
                                                                                l . . . f −x1 .
                                                                                         α1
    For µ = −(x1 α1 + x2 α2 + ... + xl αl ) ∈ K ⊗ Qa and a UFΓa -module N, let fΓµa N be
the module N twisted by the automorphism Θ(x1 ,...,xl ) , i.e. the vector space N with
UFΓa -action defined by u · fΓµa v := fΓµa (Θ(x1 ,...,xl ) (u) · v), where for v ∈ N, fΓµa v stands
for the element v considered as an element of the twisted module fΓµa N. In particular,
if v is a weight vector of weight η, then fΓµa v is a weight vector of weight η + µ. Set
ΨµΓa M := fΓµa MFΓa . Note that ΨµΓ1a M ≃ ΨµΓ2a M whenever µ1 − µ2 ∈ Qa and therefore
the d-module ΨµΓa M is well-defined up to an isomorphism for µ ∈ K ⊗ Qa/Qa. For
any Γa-bijective d-submodule L of ΨµΓa M, set Φ−µ                             −µ
                                                                Γa L := fΓa L ∩ M (the intersection is
defined in MFΓa ).
    The map ΨµΓa from the lattice of d-submodules of M to the lattice of d-submodules
of ΨµΓa M plays central role in the paper and this section is devoted to its properties.
The injectivity and surjectivity of this map for the case when g is a Lie algebra, d = a
and M = Mp(S) are also studied in [BFL]. We start with the observation that the
image of ΨµΓa always contains the set of all Γa-bijective submodules of ΨµΓa M.

Lemma 2.1 With the notations above, let µ ∈ K ⊗ Qa and N be a d-submodule of
ΨµΓa M for which N ≃ NFΓa . Then ΨµΓa (Φ−µ
                                        Γa N) = N.


Proof. The statement is equivalent to (M ∩ fΓ−µ     a
                                                      N)FΓa = fΓ−µ  a
                                                                      N. Since N is Γa-
bijective, so is fΓ−µ
                    a
                      N. Therefore we have (M  ∩ f −µ
                                                  Γa  N) FΓ a ⊆ (f −µ          −µ
                                                                  Γa N)FΓa = fΓa N. To
prove the inverse inclusion, observe that for any x ∈ fΓ−µa
                                                              N ⊆ MFΓa there is f ∈ FΓa
                          −µ
for which f · x ∈ M ∩ fΓa N.                                                         

                                                                   4
Lemma 2.2 Let M1 ⊂ M2 be Γa-injective d-modules.
    (i) The d-module M2 /M1 is Γa-injective if and only if M1 = M2 ∩ (M1 )FΓa . In
particular, if M2 /M1 is simple, then it is Γa-injective if and only if (M1 )FΓa 6= (M2 )FΓa .
    (ii) If M2 /M1 is Γa-injective, then (M2 )FΓa /(M1 )FΓa ≃ (M2 /M1 )FΓa . In particular
ΨµΓa (M2 )/ΨµΓa (M1 ) ≃ ΨµΓa (M2 /M1 ) for every µ ∈ K ⊗ Qa.

Proof. (i) The Γa-localizability of M2 /M1 fails if and only if fα · m2 ∈ M1 for some
m2 ∈ M2 \ M1 and α ∈ Γa. The latter is equivalent to m2 ∈ ((M1 )FΓa ∩ M2 ) \ M1 ,
which implies the first part of the statement. If M2 /M1 is simple then the inclusions
M1 ⊆ M2 ∩ (M1 )FΓa ⊂ M2 imply the second part. (ii) is a corollary of (i).          

Lemma 2.3 Let M1 ⊂ M2 ⊂ M3 be a triple of Γa-injective d-modules such that
M2 /M1 is Γa-injective and (M2 )FΓa = (M3 )FΓa (in particular M3 /M2 is not Γa-
injective). Set M2′ := M3 ∩ (M1 )FΓa . Then M1 ⊂ M2′ ⊂ M3 is a triple of Γa-injective
d-modules such that M3 /M2′ is Γa-injective and (M1 )FΓa = (M2′ )FΓa .

Proof. The inclusions M1 ⊆ M2′ ⊂ (M1 )FΓa imply (M1 )FΓa = (M2′ )FΓa . The injectiv-
ity of M3 /M2′ follows from Lemma 2.2.
                                                                                  

    The following lemma shows that the the map ΨΓa (and in particular the FΓa -
localization) commutes with the functors H 0 , Mp, and Lp.

Lemma 2.4 Let Γa ⊂ ∆a be a set of commuting roots which is a basis of Qa and R
be an a-module whose support lies in a single K ⊗ Qa-coset.
    (i) The following conditions are equivalent:
    • the a-module R is Γa-injective,
    • the g-module Mp(R) is Γa-injective,
    • the g-module Lp(R) is Γa-injective.
    (ii) Let R be Γa-injective. Then:
    • H 0 (u, ΨµΓa (Lp(R))) ≃ ΨµΓa (H 0 (u, Lp(R))) ≃ ΨµΓa R,
    • Lp(ΨµΓa (R)) ≃ ΨµΓa (Lp(R)),
    • Mp(ΨµΓa (R)) ≃ ΨµΓa (Mp(R)),
for all µ ∈ K ⊗ Qa. In particular, ΨµΓa R is simple if and only if ΨµΓa (Lp(R)) is simple.

Proof. (i) If R is Γa-injective then Lp(R) is also Γa-injective by Corollary 3.4 in
[DMP]. A submodule of a Γa-injective module is Γa-injective, and hence it remains
to show that Mp(R) and Lp(R) are Γa-injective whenever R is Γa-injective. Suppose
that fα · m = 0 for some α ∈ Γa and m ∈ Mp(R). We may assume that m ∈ Mp(R)λ
for some λ ∈ h∗ . By the PBW Theorem we have Mp(R) ≃ U(u− ) ⊗ S, and in
                   P
particular m = N      i=1 ui ⊗ mi for someP  ui ∈ U(u− )λ−λi , mi ∈ S λi , and λi ∈ h∗ . If
u′i := fα ui − ui fα ∈ U(u− )λ−λi +α , then N                         ′
                                              i=1 (ui ⊗ (fα · mi ) + ui ⊗ mi ) = 0. Let i0 be
such that λi0 +α 6= λi for every i = 1, ..., N. Since R is Γa-injective, ui0 ⊗(fα ·mi0 ) 6= 0,
and thus ui0 ⊗ (fα · mi0 ) + u′′j0 ⊗ mj0 = 0, for some j0 and u′′j0 ∈ U(u− )λ−λj0 +α . This
implies that λi0 + α = λj0 which contradicts to the choice of i0 . Hence Mp(R) is
Γa-injective.

                                                                            µ
    We show next that Lp(R) is Γa-injective. Since Zp(R) ⊆ ⊕µ∈u     / Mp(R) , where u
is the K ⊗ Qa-coset for which supp R ⊂ u, we have (Zp(R))Γa ∩ R = 0. Therefore
Zp(R) ⊆ (Zp(R))Γa ∩ Mp(R) ⊂ Mp(R), and by the maximality of Zp(R) we find that
Zp(R) = (Zp(R))Γa ∩ Mp(R). Now Lemma 2.2 implies that Lp(R) is Γa-injective.
    (ii) The proof of the statement is a modification of the proof of Lemma 13.2 in
[M]. Set for simplicity u+ := u. The inclusions [fα , u± ] ⊆ u± for every α ∈ Γa easily
imply

(2.5)                        fΓµa (u± · RFΓa ) = u± · (fΓµa RFΓa )
                                                     P
for all µ ∈ K ⊗ Qa. Applying (2.5) for µ = − ki=1 xi αi and positive integers xi
we obtain (U(u± ) · R)FΓa = U(u± ) · RFΓa . Therefore, using the PBW theorem we
have: Mp(ΨµΓa (R)) ≃ U(u− ) · (fΓµa RFΓa ) = fΓµa (U(u− ) · RFΓa ) = fΓµa (U(u− ) · R)FΓa =
ΨµΓa (Mp(R)) for all µ ∈ K ⊗ Qa. Finally, a double application of (2.5) yields

        H 0(u, fΓµa (Lp(R))FΓa ) ≃ fΓµa H 0 (u, (Lp(R))FΓa ) ≃ fΓµa H 0 (u, Lp(R))FΓa ,

which completes the proof of all statements in (ii).                                      
   The following theorem is our main result in this section.

Theorem 2.6 Let M be a Γa-injective d-module of finite length.
  (i) There exists a composition series

(2.7)   0 = M10 ⊂ M11 ⊂ ... ⊂ Mr11 ⊂ M12 ⊂ ... ⊂ Mr22 ⊂ ... ⊂ M1t ⊂ ... ⊂ Mrtt = M

of M such that
    • (Mij11 )FΓa = (Mij22 )FΓa if and only if j1 = j2 ;
    • all modules Mj := Mrjj /Mrj−1  j−1
                                         are Γa-injective.
    (ii) The modules Mj are indecomposable.
    (iii) For every µ ∈ K ⊗Qa the d-module ΨµΣ (M) admits a filtration 0 ⊂ ΨµΣ (M11 ) =
... = ΨµΣ (Mr11 ) ⊂ ΨµΣ (M12 ) = ... = ΨµΣ (Mr22 ) ⊂ ... ⊂ ΨµΣ (M1t ) = ... = ΨµΣ (Mrtt ) =
ΨµΣ (M) with successive nontrivial quotients ΨµΣ (Mj ).

Proof. (i) Starting with an arbitrary composition series of M we enumerate the
successive submodules so that the first condition is satisfied. In order to obtain Γa-
injective quotients Mj we modify the series by consequently applying Lemma 2.3 for
j = t, t − 1, ..., 2. As a result we obtain a series for which Mj are indecomposable for
j > 1. Finally, M1 ≃ Mr11 is always Γa-injective as a submodule of M and thus the
assertion is proved.
    (ii) Lemma 2.2 implies that among the simple quotients M1i /M1i−1 only M11 ≃
M1i /M10 is Γa-injective. Every simple submodule of M1 ≃ Mr11 is Γa-injective and
therefore is isomorphic to M11 . In particular, every submodule X of M1 has a simple
submodule isomorphic to M11 . Thus (M11 )FΓa ≃ XFΓa ≃ (M1 )FΓa . Suppose now
M1 ≃ A ⊕ B for some d-modules A and B. Then AFΓa ≃ BFΓa ≃ (M1 )FΓa on one
hand, and (Mj )FΓa ≃ AFΓa ⊕ BFΓa on the other, which is impossible. Therefore
M1 is indecomposable. In order to show that Mj is indecomposable for j > 1 we

                                              6
apply induction on j observing that all submodules of the Γa-injective module Mj :=
Mrjj /Mrj−1
          j−1
              have the same Γa-localization.
    (iii) follows directly from Lemma 2.2, (ii).                                  
    We call a series (2.7) with the properties of Theorem 2.6, (i), a Γa − injective
composition series of M.


3     Coherent Families of Weight Modules
In the rest of the paper g will be one of the following Lie superalgebras: gl(m|n),
sl(m|n), for m 6= n, psl(m|m), osp(2|n) (where n = 2q), p(m), sp(m), or W(n). We
will also assume that all weight modules considered have finite weight multiplicities.
In this section we define a (g, a)-coherent family and show that every simple g-module
M is a submodule of a unique semisimple coherent family Ea(M).
     We start by recalling some basic facts about the root structure of the listed above
Lie superalgebras. More details can be found in [P]. For all Lie superalgebras g
we have h = h0 and h1 = 0. Let ∆ = ∆0 ∪ ∆1 be the set of roots of g and let
∆1 = ∆+              −                        ±
            1 ∪ ∆1 , where ∆0 and ∆1 are written explicitly below.
     • If g = gl(m|n), g = sl(m|n) for m 6= n, or g = psl(m|m) for m = n then
g0 = g′0 = gl(m) ⊕ gl(n) for g = gl(m|n), g0 = g′0 ≃ sl(m) ⊕ sl(n) ⊕ K for g = sl(m|n),
and g0 = g′0 ≃ sl(m) ⊕ sl(m) for g = psl(m|m). The vector space h∗gl(m|n) has a basis
                                                             P       P
{ε1 , ..., εm , δ1 , ..., δn } and h∗sl(m|n) ≃ h∗gl(m|n) /(K( i εi − j δj )). For the images of εi
                                                                                 P          P
and δj in h∗sl(m|n) we use the same letters. Furthermore, h∗psl(m|m) ≃ { i ki εi + i li δi ∈
              P            P
h∗sl(m|m) |       i ki +
                                              ∗
                               i li = 0} ⊂ hsl(m|m) . In all cases ∆0 = {εi − εj , δk − δl | 1 ≤ i 6=
j ≤ m, 1 ≤ k 6= l ≤ n}, ∆±           1 = {±(εi − δl ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ l ≤ n}.
     • If g = osp(2|n), n = 2q then
g0 = g′0 = o(2) ⊕ sp(n) ≃ K ⊕ sp(n). The vector space h∗ has a basis {ε1 , δ1 , ..., δq },
∆0 = {±2δk , ±δk ± δl | 1 ≤ k 6= l ≤ q}, ∆±            1 = {±(ε1 + δk ), ±(ε1 − δk ) | 1 ≤ k ≤ q}.
     • If g = p(m), or g = sp(m), then
g0 = g′0 = gl(m) for g = p(m) and g0 = g′0 = sl(m) for gP= sp(m). The vector
space h∗p(m) has a basis {ε1 , ..., εm } and h∗sp(m) ≃ h∗p(m) /(K( i εi )). For the images
of εi in h∗sp(m) we use the same letters. ∆0 = {εi − εj | 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m}, ∆+                   1 =
                                             −
{εi + εj , 2εi | 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m}, ∆1 = {−(εi + εj ) | 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m}.
     • If g = W(n) then
g′0 = gl(n) and g′′0 is a nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension n2n−1 −n2 . The vector space
h∗ has a basis {ε1 , ..., εn }. ∆0 = {εi1 + ... + εik , εi1 + ... + εil − εj | k = 2t, l = 2u + 1},
∆1 = {εi1 + ... + εik , εi1 + ... + εil − εj | k = 2t + 1, l = 2u},
     All Lie superalgebras admit a natural Z-grading. If g 6=W(n) then g = g−1 ⊕ g0 ⊕
g1 , where g±1 := ⊕α∈∆±1 gα and g0 := g0 . For g = W(n) we consider the Z-grading
                                                               P
                 n−1
W(n) := ⊕k=−1             Wk , where Wk := ⊕P ti =k W(n) ti εi . We also set W≥k := ⊕i≥k Wi .
     If c is a reductive Lie algebra, a c-module R is called torsion-free if for every
α ∈ ∆c, every x ∈ cα acts bijectively on R. The following description of all simple
weight g-modules follows from a set of results in [DMP] and is crucial in our paper.


                                                 7
Proposition 3.8 Let M be a simple g-module. There exists a parabolic subsuperal-
gebra q ⊂ g with nilradical nq for which q = c ⊕ nq and c is a reductive Lie subalgebra
of g′0 containing h, such that M ≃ Lq(R) for some torsion-free c-module R. The list
of possible Lie algebras c is provided below.
    • If g = gl(m|n) (respectively, g = sl(m|n)), m 6= n, then c is isomorphic to
gl(m1 , ..., mk , n1 P
                     , ..., nl ) (resp., sl(m
                                          P 1 , ..., mk , n1 , ..., nl ) ), for some positive integers
mi and nj with i mi = m and j nj = n.
    • If g = psl(m|m) then c is isomorphic P          to sl(m1 , ..., mk ) ⊕ sl(m′1 , ..., m′l ), for some
                                                      P
positive integers mi and m′j with i mi = j m′j = m.
    • If g = osp(2|n), n = 2q then c is        P  isomorphic to k ⊕ gl(q1′ , ..., qk′ ) ⊕ sp(2q ′′ ), for
some positive integers qi′ and q ′′ with i qi′ = q ′ and q ′ + q ′′ = q.
    • If g = sp(m) (respectively, g = p(m)) then c is isomorphic            P         to sl(m1 , ..., mk )
(resp., gl(m1 , ..., mk )), for some positive integers mi with i mi = m.
    •P If g = W(n) then c is isomorphic to gl(n1 , ..., nk ), for some positive integers ni
with i ni = n.                                                            P
    (For a k-tuple of positive integers (m1 , ..., mk ) with i mi = m by               P sl(m1 , ..., mk )
we denote {(g1 + ... + gk ) ∈ gl(m1 , ..., mk ) := gl(m1 ) ⊕ ... ⊕ gl(mk ) | i tr(gi ) = 0}.)
Proof. Assume for simplicity that g is simple (for g = gl(m|n) and g = p(m) the
statement easily follows from the cases of g = sl(m|n) and g = sp(m) respectively).
Following [DMP], we recall some definitions which will be used in this proof only. For
a finite dimensional Lie superalgebra k and a simple k-module R denote by inj(R)
the set of all roots α ∈ (∆k)0 such that x acts injectively on R for some x ∈ (k0 )α . Let
Cinj(R) be the cone in Qk generated by inj(R), and let CR := {λ ∈ Qk | mλ ∈ Cinj(R) ,
for some m ∈ Z} be the saturation of Cinj(R) . Theorem 3.6 and Corollary 3.7 in
[DMP] imply that M is isomorphic to the unique simple quotient LT (Ω) of Mg0 ⊕g+ (Ω)
                                                                                        T T
where g = g−   T ⊕  g 0

                             T , g±
                                  T :=  ⊕ l(α)∈Z± gα
                                                     , g0
                                                        T := ⊕ l(α)=0 gα
                                                                         for some  linear map
l : Q → Z and a simple g0T -module Ω for which CΩ = Qg0T . Furthermore, we use the
classification of all possible Lie superalgebras g0T provided in Section 7 of [DMP]. We
conclude that (g0T )1 = 0 except for the following couples (g, g0T ): (psl(m|m), sl(m|m)),
(sp(m), sp(m)) and (sp(2m), sl(m|m))). In the remaining three cases we observe
that Ω ≃ L(g0T )0 ⊕(g0T )1 (S), where S := H 0 ((g0T )1 , Ω) is a torsion-free (g0T )0 -module.
Therefore M ≃ L(g0 )0 ⊕((g0 )1 +g+ ) (S) and we complete the proof.                          

Remark. The fact that every simple g-module is isomorphic to a quotient of a
module induced from a parabolical subalgebra, whose reductive part is a Lie algebra,
is the main reason to restrict our attention to the listed Lie superalgebras and to
study the structure of the g-modules Lp(S) and Mp(S).

    Let a ≃ s ⊕ z ≃ a1 ⊕ ... ⊕ ak ⊕ z, where ai are simple Lie algebras and z is the
center of a. For every weight η ∈ h∗ ≃ (⊕ki=1 h∗ai ) ⊕ h∗z we write η ai , η z, and η s for
                                                                               P
the projections of η on h∗ai , h∗z , and h∗s respectively, i.e. η = η s + η z = ki=1 η ai + η z.
Fix a basis B of ∆ such that B ⊂ ∆p, and set Ba := B ∩ ∆a. For any λ ∈ h∗ ,
let MBa (λ) (respectively, MB (λ)) be the Verma module with Ba-highest (resp., B-
highest) weight λ and LBa (λ) (resp., LB (λ) ≃ Lp(LBa (λ))) be its unique simple

quotient. Set Ta∗ := h∗ /Qa, Ts∗ := (K ⊗ Qa)/Qa ≃ h∗s /Qs and T ∗ := h∗ /Qg. For
U ⊂ h∗ and an h-module M define M[U] := ⊕η∈U M η . The elements of T ∗ and Ta∗
will be considered as subsets of h∗ . In particular, for a g-module M and t ∈ T ∗ , M[t]
is a g-submodule of M. Set h∗rel := h∗ /K ⊗ Qa ≃ z. For any a-module M and t ∈ h∗rel ,
put dega M[t] := supµ∈t dim M µ . The function dega : t 7→ dega M[t] is called the
a-relative degree of M. We will call M a-bounded if dega M[t] < ∞ for any t ∈ h∗rel
(In [M], Mathieu uses the term “admissible” weight module, but to avoid confusion
with Harish-Chandra modules of finite type we prefer to use the term “bounded”
weight module).
Lemma 3.9 Let S be an a-bounded a-module, Then Mp(S) (and thus also Lp(S)) is
an a-bounded g-module of finite length.
Proof. Being an a-bounded module, S has finite length (Lemma 3.3 in [M]), and since
Mp is an exact functor we may assume that S is simple. The admissibility of Mp(S)
follows from the the admissibility of S and the isomorphism Mp(S) ≃ U(u− ) ⊗ S.
Indeed, if t ∈ h∗rel and ∆u− is the root system of u− , the set
                                      r
                                      X
         X(t) := {(β1 , ..., βr ) |         βi ∈ supp(Mp(S)[t]) − supp S, βi ∈ ∆u− }
                                      i=1
                          P                              P
is finite. Then N(t) := (β1 ,...βr )∈X(T ) dim(U(u− ) βi ) < ∞ and therefore
dega(Mp(S)[t]) ≤ N(t) dega S for every t ∈ h∗rel . In order to show that Mp(S) has
finite length recall that every finitely generated weight module with finite weight
multiplicities over a reductive Lie algebra has finite length (Theorem 4.21 in [F]).
Since for any s ∈ S, Mp(S) ≃ U(u− ) ⊗ S ≃ U · (1 ⊗ s) is finitely generated g′0 -module,
, Mp(S) has finite length.                                                            
     Assume that M is a g-module for which supp M is included in a single Q-coset.
Then M[λ+Qa] = M[λ+K ⊗Qa] for every λ ∈ h∗ , and therefore whenever we consider
M[t] we may assume that t ∈ Ta∗ . In this case set suppTa∗ M := {t ∈ Ta∗ | M[t] 6= 0} ⊂
Qg/Qa. The partial order of Qg determined by B defines naturally a partial order on
suppTa∗ M. If M is a-bounded, its a-essential support is suppa−ess M := ∪t∈Ta∗ {λ ∈
t| dim M λ = dega M[t]}. Then M is called strictly a-bounded (or just bounded in the
special case of a = g′0 ) if suppa−ess M ∩ t is Zariski dense in the vector space K ⊗ t
for any t ∈ suppTa∗ M.
     The motivation of introducing the above terminology is contained in the following
slight modification of Lemma 13.1 in [M]. We skip the proof which essentially repeats
the arguments of Mathieu’s proof.
Lemma 3.10 Let S be a simple a-module.
   (i) The following are equivalent:
   • S is strictly a-bounded a-module,
   • Lp(S) is strictly a-bounded g-module,
   • Mp(S) is strictly a-bounded g-module.
   (ii) If S is a-bounded, then it is strictly bounded if and only if there exists a basis
Γa of ∆a which consist of commuting roots such that S is Γa-injective.                  

                                                  9
    Let λ ∈ h∗ . Lemma 2.4 implies that if one of the modules LBa (λ), LB (λ), or Mp(λ)
is Γa-injective then so are the other two. In that case we say that   P λ is Γa-injective
(or (B, Γa)-injective when B is not fixed). We say also that λ = ki=1 λai + λz is a-
partially finite if λai is dominant integral for some i. Furthermore, we call a d-module
L of finite length a-partially finite if every simple subquotient of L is a highest weight
module with an d-partially finite highest weight.

Lemma 3.11 (i) Let LBa (λ) be an bounded module. Then λ is Γa-injective if and
only if λ is not an a-partially finite weight.
    (ii) Let L1 ⊆ L2 be Γa-injective d-modules such that L2 /L1 has finite length. Then,
if (L1 )FΓa = (L2 )FΓa , the d-module L2 /L1 is a-partially finite.

Proof. (i) It is clear that no λai is dominant integral for a Γa-injective weight λ. The
inverse direction follows from Lemma 3.10, (ii). (ii) Since (L1 )FΓa = LFΓa = (L2 )FΓa
for every d-module L such that L1 ⊆ L ⊆ L2 , it is enough to consider the case when
L2 /L1 is simple. Then the statement follows from part (i) and Lemma 2.2, (i).        
    Following [M], if d is a positive integer, an s-coherent family M of degree d is an
s-module satisfying the following two conditions:
(i) dim Mλ = d for any λ ∈ h∗s ;
(ii) the trace function λ 7→ tr(u)|Mλ is polynomial in λ ∈ h∗s for any fixed u ∈ U(s)0 .
    We define an a-module M to be an a-coherent family if M[h] is s-coherent family
for every h ∈ h∗rel . In particular, every a-coherent family is a-bounded and is a
(possibly infinite) direct sum of s-coherent families which are a-modules. A (g, a)-
coherent family is a g-module M which is an a-coherent family. A (g, a)-coherent
family M is said to be irreducible if M[t] is a simple g-module for some t ∈ T ∗ . M
is semisimple if M[t] is a semisimple g-module for any t ∈ T ∗ .
    For an a-bounded g-module M, a (g, a)-coherent extension E of M is a (g, a)-
coherent family which contains M as a subquotient and dega M = dega E. For any
Γa-injective a-module R, we set EΓa (R) := ⊕µ∈Ts∗ ΨµΓa (R).

Proposition 3.12 Let S be a strictly a-bounded simple a-module, and let Γa ⊂
∆a be such that S is Γa-injective (the existence of Γa follows from Lemma 3.10).
Then EΓa (S), EΓa (Lp(S)), and EΓa (Mp(S)) are (g, a)-coherent extensions of S, Lp(S),
and Mp(S) respectively. Moreover, Lp(EΓa (S)) ≃ EΓa (Lp(S)) and Mp(EΓa (S)) ≃
EΓa (Mp(S)).

Proof. For every Γa-injective a-module R we have dega R = dega ΨµΓa (R) for any
µ ∈ Ts∗ which implies the first part of the proposition. The second part is a corollary
of Lemma 2.4, (ii).                                                                  

Proposition 3.13 Let M be a simple g-module isomorphic to Lp(S) for some strictly
a-bounded a-module S.
   (i) There exists a unique semisimple (g, a)-coherent extension Ea(M) of M iso-
morphic to (Lp(EΓa (S)))ss ≃ (EΓa (M))ss for some Γa ⊂ ∆a such that S is Γa-injective.


                                           10
    (ii) The (g, a)-coherent family Ea(M) is irreducible. For any simple strictly a-
bounded g-submodule N of Ea(M), we have Ea(M) ≃ Ea(N).
    (iii) Let S be a torsion-free a-module. For any basis D of ∆, such that D ⊂ ∆p,
there is a strictly a-bounded highest weight g-submodule LD (λ) of Ea(M). Moreover,
there exists a set Σa ⊂ ∆a of commuting roots which is a basis of Qa such that:
    • ΨµΣa (LDa (λ)) ≃ S, where Da := D ∩ ∆a,
    • ΨµΣa (LD (λ)) ≃ M,
    • ΨµΣa (Mp(λ)) ≃ Mp(S), where µ ∈ h∗ is any weight for which µ + λ ∈ supp S.
Proof. (i) Proposition 3.12 implies that EΓa (M) ≃ Lp(EΓa (S)) is a coherent extension
of M. Using Lemma 3.9 we see that Lp(EΓa (S))[t] has finite length for every t ∈ T ∗ and
thus we may define a semisimple coherent extension Ea(M) := ⊕t∈T ∗ (Lp(EΓa (S))[t])ss
of M. Let E ′ be another semisimple coherent extension of M. The a-modules E ′ and
Ea(M) have the same trace on the Zariski dense subset suppa−essM ∩ t of t ⊗ K for
every t ∈ suppTa∗ M. Since a semisimple a-module is determined uniquely by its trace
(Lemma 2.3 in [M]) we have that E ′[s] and Ea(M)[s] are isomorphic a-modules for
every s ∈ h∗rel . It remains to show that they are isomorphic g-modules. If λ0 ∈ supp S,
then t0 = λ0 + Qa is a minimal element in suppTa∗ M (in particular M[t0 ] ≃ S). Thus
s0 := λ0 + µ + Qa is a minimal element in suppTa∗ E ′ [s] = suppTa∗ Ea(M)[s] for any
µ ∈ K ⊗ Qa such that λ0 + µ ∈ s. Since E ′[s0 ] ≃ Ea(M)[s0 ] has finite length we can
choose isomorphic simple a-submodules L′ and N ′ of E ′ [s0 ] and Ea(M)[s0 ] respectively.
Then E ′ [s0 ] ≃ Lp(L′ ) ⊕ L′′ and Ea(M)[s0 ] ≃ Lp(N ′ ) ⊕ N ′′ for some semisimple g-
modules L′′ and N ′′ with isomorphic a-composition factors. We prove that E ′ [s] and
Ea(M)[s] are isomorphic g-modules by induction on the length of Ea(M)[s] (which is
finite by Lemma 3.9).
    (ii) Let r0 , t0 ∈ Ta∗ be such that M[t0 ] = S and N[r0 ] = H 0 (u, N). Then N[r0 ]
is a strictly a-bounded module. By Lemma 3.10 we find a basis Γ′a of ∆a consisting
of commuting roots such that N is Γ′a-injective. Since S is a-bounded, by the Lie
algebra version of the statement (Proposition 4.8 in [M]), R := ΨνΓa (S) is a simple
a-module for some ν ∈ h∗ . Then by Lemma 2.4, Lp(R) ≃ ΨνΓa (M). On the other hand
Ea(S)[t0 ] contains a Γ′a-injective simple submodule N0′ , and in particular ΨνΓ′a (N0′ ) ≃
R. Therefore, if N ′ := Lp(N0′ ), part (i) of the theorem implies Ea(N ′ ) ≃ Ea(M).
If r0 = t0 we may assume that N ′ = N which implies the statement. Suppose
now r0 6= t0 . Then N and N ′ are nonisomorphic g-submodules of Ea(M), and thus
dega Ea(M)[r0 ] ≥ dega N[r0 ] + dega N ′ [r0 ] > dega Ea(N ′ )[r0 ] = dega Ea(M)[r0 ], which
is impossible.
    (iii) Theorem 13.3 in [M] implies that there exists λ ∈ h∗ such that ΨνΓa (LDa (λ)) ≃
S. Now using Lemma 2.4 we complete the proof.                                             

Note. The above theorem has been proved in [M] for the case when g = a. The case
when g is a Lie superalgebra of type I and a = g0 is considered in [G]. One should note
that the statement of Theorem 8 in [G] requires a slight modification, namely that the
module M should be assumed to be strictly bounded instead of infinite dimensional
bounded (this modification is necessary for the cases g = gl(m|n) and g = sl(m|n)
and m, n ≥ 2).

                                            11
    Recall that the Harish-Chandra homomorphism embeds the center Z(g) of U into
the W -invariant polynomials of h∗ . As usual, this enables us to assign to each weight
µ a central character θµ , i.e. a homomorphism θµ : Z(g) → K.
Remark. Let g be one of the following sl(m|p), psl(m|m), osp(2|p), i.e. Z(g) 6= K.
One easily checks that the map ΨνΣa preserves central characters (in the strong sense).
Therefore all submodules of Ea(M) have the same central character. As a corollary
                                                                 λ
of Proposition 3.13, (iii), we see that the category WT θ [t] of weight modules with
fixed central character θλ whose support lie in a fixed Q-coset t contains finitely many
                                                                            λ
simple objects. This is true because the corresponding category Oθ [t] whose simple
objects are highest weight modules has the same property. In particular, if Ba′ is
fixed basis of ∆a and Kλ is the set of all couples (B ′ , λ′ ), where B ′ is a basis of ∆
                                                        ′
containing Ba′ and λ′ is a weight for which θλ = θλ , then the “universal” semisimple
(g, a)-coherent family U(θλ , a) := ⊕(B′ ,λ′ )∈Kλ Ea(LB′ (λ′ )) contains all simple weight g-
modules with central character θλ which are a-torsion-free. Finally, for λ ∈ h∗ denote
by SA(λ) the set of all reductive Lie algebras c of g0 containing h for which LB′ (λ) is
strictly c-bounded for some basis B ′ of ∆. Then the module U(θλ ) := ⊕c∈SA(λ) U(θλ , c)
is a finite direct sum of coherent families and contains all simple weight modules with
central character θλ .


4     On the Composition Series of Weight Modules
In this section we find a necessary and sufficient condition for the modules Lp(S) and
Mp(S) to be d-semisimple (and in particular g0 -semisimple) provided that the answer
for this question is known for the modules LB (λ) and Mp(λ). An interesting appli-
cation is obtained for the case g = osp(2|n). We keep the notations and conventions
from the previous sections, and unless otherwise stated we set D := B in part (iii) of
Proposition 3.13.

Lemma 4.14 Let α ∈ ∆ and λ and λ + α be Γa-injective weights. Then for ν ∈ h∗
the following are equivalent:
    (i) ΨνΓ (LBa (λ)) is simple;
    (ii) ΨνΓ (LBa (λ + α)) is simple;
    (iii)ΨνΓ (LBa (λ)) is torsion-free;
    (iv) ΨνΓ (LBa (λ + α)) is torsion-free.

Proof. A Theorem of Fernando implies that a simple a-module R is torsion-free if
and only if supp(R) = λ + Qa for some λ ∈ h∗ (see Corollary 1.4 in [M]). Therefore
(i) and (ii) are equivalent to (iii) and (iv) respectively. We show now that (i) and
(ii) are equivalent. Following [M], for µ ∈ h∗s , denote by Sing(θµ ) the subset of Ts∗
consisted of the cosets ν + Qg for which ΨνΓ (LBa (µ)) is not simple. Mathieu showed
that Sing(θµ ) depends only on the central character θµ and equals the finite union
∪s∈Ws ,i∈F (s(µ)+Hi ) of hyperplanes in Ts∗ . Each hyperplane s(µ)+Hi contains s(µ) for
some s ∈ Ws (if µ is integral then all hyperplanes contain µ). The index set F is finite

                                             12
and for its precise definition we refer the reader to Section 10 in [M]. We must show
                             s  s                             s
that λs +αs +ν s ∈/ Sing(θλ +α ) whenever λs +ν s ∈/ Sing(θλ ). But for s ∈ Ws we have
                                                                                 s   s
s(αs) − αs = s(α) − α ∈ Qs as s(αz) = αz. Therefore λs + αs + ν s + Qs ∈ Sing(θλ +α )
if and only if λs + αs + ν s − s(λs + αs) + Qs ∈ ∪i∈F Hi for some s ∈ Ws. The latter is
                                  s
equivalent to λs + αs ∈ Sing(θλ ) which completes the proof.                         
Proposition 4.15 Let λ be a Γa-injective weight for which ΨνΓ (LBa (λ)) ≃ S is a
torsion-free a-module for some ν ∈ h∗ . Let M be one of the d-modules LB (λ)[t] or
Mp(λ)[t], where t ∈ Td∗ . Then if 0 = M11 ⊂ ... ⊂ Mr11 ⊂ M12 ⊂ ... ⊂ Mr22 ⊂ ... ⊂ M1t ⊂
... ⊂ Mrtt = M is a Γa-injective composition series of M, ΨνΣ (M11 ) ⊂ ΨνΣ (M12 ) ⊂ ... ⊂
ΨνΣ (M1t ) = ΨνΓ (M) is a composition series of ΨνΓ (M) (i.e. of Lp(S)[t] or Mp(S)[t]).
Proof. The proposition follows directly from Lemmas 2.4 and 4.14, and Theorem
2.6.                                                                               
    If K and L are weight d-modules, then K is a a-partially finite enlargement of L
if there exists an exact sequence 0 → L → K → L′ → 0 for some a-partially finite
d-module L′ .
Corollary 4.16 The weight d-module Lp(S) (respectively, Mp(S)) is semisimple if
and only if LB (λ) (resp., Mp(λ)) is an a-partially finite enlargement of a semisimple
d-module.
Proof. In order to prove the statement for Lp(S), it is enough to consider the module
Lp(S)[t], where t ∈ Td∗ . If LB (λ)[t]/(⊕ri=1 Li ) is an a-partially finite d-module, then
LB (λ)[t] has a Σa-injective composition series (2.7) for which t = r, r1 = ... = rk−1 =
1, and M1l ≃ ⊕li=1 Li for l = 1, ..., r. Then combining Theorem 2.6 and Lemma
4.14 we see that the d-modules ΨνΣa (Li ) are simple and Lp(S)[t] ≃ ΨνΣa (L(λ)[t]) ≃
⊕ri=1 ΨνΣa (Li ). Suppose now that Lp(S)[t] ≃ ⊕ri=1 Mi is a semisimple d-module, and set
Ni := Φ−ν Σa (Mi ). If Xi is a simple submodule of Ni then the simplicity of Mi implies
ΨνΣa (Xi ) ≃ Mi ≃ ΨνΣa (Ni ). Using Lemma 3.11 we show that Ni is an a-partially finite
enlargement of Xi . Again by Lemma 3.11, LB (λ)[t] is an a-partially finite enlargement
of ⊕ri=1 (Ni ) which completes the proof for Lp(S). The proof for Mp(S) is analogous.

    For a simple g′0 -module R we set K(R) := Mg0 ⊕g1 (R) for g 6=W(n), and K(R) :=
MW≥0 (R) (provided that W≥1 acts trivially on R) for g =W(n). We call K(R)
a generalized Kac module. In the particular case of S = LBg′ (λ) we obtain the
                                                                       0
(classical) Kac module KB (λ).
Corollary 4.17 Let g = osp(2|n). Then if S is an a-strictly bounded simple a-
module, the a-module Mp(S) (and therefore Lp(S) too) is an a-partially finite enlarge-
ment of a semisimple a-module. In particular, if a = g0 , every bounded generalized
Kac module K(S) (and therefore every bounded simple g-module) is a partially finite
enlargement of a semisimple g0 -module.
Proof. The torsion-free a-modules of finite length are semisimple (see Theorem 1
in [BKLM]) and therefore the statement is true for a torsion-free a-module S. By
applying twice Corollary 4.16 for d = a, we prove the statement for any a-strictly
bounded module S.                                                               

5     Explicit Character Formula
In this section we apply Theorem 2.6 to the case when d = g and M = Mp(λ), and
write down an explicit character formula for any simple weight g-module Lp(S) in
terms of the multiplicities [MB (ν) : LB (µ)].

Lemma 5.18 If µ ∈ h∗ then
                                     X
               [MB (λ) : LB (µ)] =    [MBa (λ) : LBa (ν)][Mp(ν) : LB (µ)].
                                       ν

Proof. Let
                      0 = M0 ⊂ M1 ⊂ ... ⊂ Mk ⊂ Mk+1 = MBa (λ)
be a composition series of the a-module MBa (λ) with successive simple quotients
Mi /Mi−1 = LBa (µi ) for some µi ∈ h∗ . Since Mp is an exact functor, the filtration

            0 = Mp(M0 ) ⊂ Mp(M1 ) ⊂ ... ⊂ Mp(Mk ) ⊂ Mp(Mk+1 ) = MB (λ)
                                                               ∗
has
P successive quotients Mp(µi ). Therefore for every λ, ν ∈ h , [MB (λ) : LB (µ)] =
   ν (MB (λ) : Mp(ν))[Mp(ν) : LB (µ)], where (MB (λ) : Mp(ν)) stands for the number
of occurencies of Mp(ν) as a quotient in the above filtration. Using the exactness of
Mp again we see that (MB (λ) : Mp(ν)) = [MBa (λ) : LBa (ν)], which completes the
proof.                                                                             
     We are now ready to write down a character formula for an arbitrary simple
g-module M ≃ Lp(S). Let us first provide a parametric description of M. Propo-
sition 3.13 implies that S ≃ Ea(LBa (λ))[σ + Qa] for some σ ∈ h∗ . Furthermore,
LBa (λ) ≃ LBa 1 (λa1 )⊗...⊗LBa k (λak )⊗Kλz , where Kλz is the one-dimensional z-module
determined by λz. The algebras ai are of type A or C (see Proposition 3.8). We may
choose B so that Bai are the standard bases of ∆ai , i.e. Bai := {ε1 −ε2 , ..., εmi−1 −εmi }
if ai = sl(mi ) and Bai := {ε1 − ε2 , ..., εmi−1 − εmi , 2εmi } if ai = sp(2mi ). Following
sections 8 and 9 in [M]       P  we may choose  P  λai (and therefore also λ) as follows. If
g = sl(mi ) then λai = m        j=1 lj εj where
                                  i
                                                  j lj = 0, and  l − lj+1 ∈ Z+ ∪ 0 if and only
                                                             Pmji
if j = 2, 3, ..., mi − 1. If g = sp(2mi ) then λ = j=1 lj εj where lj ∈ 21 + Z and
                                                        ai

l1 ≥ l2 ≥ ... ≥ lmi ≥ − 12 . The module M is uniquely determined by the ordered tuple
(p, λa1 , ..., λak , λz, σ). The elements of this tuple will be the main ingredients in the
character formula.
     For a Lie superalgebra k with reductive even part k0 and a basis Bk of ∆k set

    µ bν,µ ch MBk (µ), i.e. [bν,µ ] is the matrix inverse to [aµ,ν ]. For simple Lie algebras k,
akν,µ and bkν,µ are computed using the Kazhdan-Lusztig algorithm. This was originally
conjectured in [KL], and proved later in [BB] and [BK]. For µ ∈ h∗ set S(µ) :=
Ψσ−λ
   Σ (LBa (µ)), or equivalently (by Proposition 3.13) S(µ) ≃ Ea(LBa (µ))[σ + Qa]. In
particular S(λ) = S. We will write the character ch Lp(S) in terms of the characters
ch Mp(S(µ)). In order to compute the character of Mp(S(µ)) we introduce some
notations.

sum of the positive roots of ∆sl(mi ) (we put µ[l] := 0 for l ≥ mi ). Every regular integral
weight λai is of the form µ[l] for some dominant integral weight µ and 1 ≤ l ≤ mi − 1.

d(λai ) := 2m1i −1 dim(LBso(2mi ) (λ̃ai )).

Proof. Lemmas 3.11 and 5.18, and Proposition 4.15 imply           Pthat     [Mp(S) : Lp(S(µ))] =
                                                                        g    a
0 if µ is a-partially finite, and [Mp(S) : Lp(S(µ))] =               ν bλ,ν aν,µ otherwise. Now

observing that aν,µ = aµa 1 ,ηa 1 ...aµa k ,ηa k we prove identity 5.20. Next, by Lemma 4.14
we verify that S(µ) is a torsion-free module and by Theorems 11.4 and 12.2 in [M]
we have dega(S(µ)) = d(λa1 )...d(λak ) which completes the proof.                              
Remark. The sum in (5.20) is locally finite, i.e. dim Lp(S)η equals a sum of finitely
many nonzero summands and therefore the formula is well-defined.

  In the case when g is a Lie algebra, Theorem 5.19 is a more explicit version of
Mathieu’s formula (Theorem 13.3 in [M])

                              dim Lp(S)µ = Supζ∈Qa (dim LB (λ)σ−λ+µ+ζ ),

where µ ∈ h∗ .
    In general, i.e. for an arbitrary classical Lie superalgebra g of type I or g =W(n),
the matrix agν,µ (and consequently bgν,µ ) is not known explicitly. In order to describe in
more details the applications of Theorem 5.19 for all Lie superalgebras g we consider,
we need the notions of typicality and singularity of a weight module, which we recall
briefly below. For more details see [PS1] and [PS2].
    A weight µ is typical if the Kac module KB (µ) is simple. Otherwise it is atypical.
Let b be the Borel subsuperalgebra of g determined by B, and ρB be the half-sum of
the b-positive even roots and the b-negative odd roots. If µ ∈ h∗ and α ∈ ∆, we say

                                                         15
that µ is (B, α)-regular iff (µ + ρB , α) 6= 0, where (·, ·) is the standard bilinear form
on h∗ . A theorem of Kac implies that for g = gl(m|n), sl(m|n), psl(m|m), osp(2|n), µ
is typical if and only if it is (B, α)-regular for all α ∈ ∆1 (the original statement of
Kac, Proposition 2.9 in [K], applies for finite dimensional modules, but one extends
his proof easily for arbitrary highest weight modules). Therefore µ is atypical iff it
is (B, α)-atypical for some α ∈ ∆1 , i.e. (µ + ρB , α) = 0. In the cases g = p(m) or
g = sp(m) Corollary 5.8 in [S1] implies that µ is atypical if and only if Πi6=j ((µ +
ρBsl(m) , εi − εj ) − 1) = 0. Finally, for g =W(n), by a result of Serganova, [S3], we
have that µ is atypical if and only if µ = aεi + εi+1 + ... + εn for some a ∈ k. The
weight µ is singular if s(µ + ρB ) = µ + ρB for some s ∈ W . Note that in the case
when Z(g) 6= K, i.e. for all Lie superalgebras except sp(m), p(m) and W(n), we
define θµ : Z(g) → K to be typical central character (respectively, atypical or singular
central character) if µ is typical (resp., atypical or singular) weight. If Z(g) 6= K, a
simple g-module with central character θµ is typical module (respectively, atypical or
singular module) if θµ is typical (resp., atypical or singular).
    It is clear that for a typical weight ν we have agν,µ = agν,µ 0
                                                                    , in which case Theorem
5.19 provides a character formula for M. The applications of Theorem 5.19 for the
atypical case are listed below.
    Let g = sl(m|n) or g = gl(m|n). In this case there is a conjectured formula due to
J. Brundan, written in terms of canonical bases of the quantized universal enveloping
algebra Uq (gl(∞)), see [B]. Therefore, our result reduces the character problem for
sl(m|n) to the Brundan conjecture. In the case when n = 1, i.e. for g = sl(m|1) the
matrix agν,µ has been found by Serganova (Corollary 9.3 in [S1]) for a set of weights ν
which includes all atypical nonsingular weights. More explicitly, if ν is a nonsingular
                                       sl(n|1)    gl(n)     gl(n)
ᾱ-atypical and ᾱ ∈ B ∩ ∆1 , then aν,µ = aν,µ + aν−ᾱ,µ which provides a character
formula for all simple nonsingular atypical sl(m|1)-modules.
    Let g = psl(m|m). The question of finding agν,µ for atypical weights ν is open in
general.
    Let g =p(m) or g = sp(m). In this case also we don’t know much about atyp-
ical highest weight modules. We obtain another version of the character formula
established by Serganova (Corollary 5.8 in [S2]).
    Let g = osp(2|n), n = 2q. Serganova’s reduction method for atypical representa-
tions applies for g (Section 4 in [N]). As in the case of g = sl(m|1), this method leads
to a character formula for all nonsingular highest weight modules, but the formula
is not available in the literature yet ([NS]). Then Theorem 5.19 yields a character
formula for all nonsingular atypical simple osp(2|n)-modules.
    Let g =W(n). For simplicity we write W instead of W(n). In this case we have
a character formula for all simple W -modules. A weight λ ∈ h∗W is atypical if and
only if λ = aεi + εi+1 + ... + εn for some a ∈ K and 1 ≤ i ≤ n, see [S3]. Fix
λ = aεi + εi+1 + ... + εn and set:
           P           j
 W             j≥0 (−1) δλ−jεi ,µ ,                                                           a∈/ Z+ ,
sλ,µ := Pa−1            j

                                                               P         a+l

where δν,η =P
            0 if ν 6= η and δν,η = 1 if ν = η. A result of Serganova, [S3], implies that
ch LB (λ) = µ sW  λ,µ ch KB (µ). Now applying Lemma 5.18 for p := W≥0 we verify that

       P W gl(n)
bλ,µ = ν sλ,ν bν,µ and finally obtain the character formula for M by Theorem 5.19.
