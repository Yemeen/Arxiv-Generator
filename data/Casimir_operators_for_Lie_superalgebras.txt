                                                    Abstract. Casimir operators — the generators of the center of the enveloping algebra
                                                    — are described for simple or close to them “classical” finite dimensional Lie superalgebras

                                                       Here we consider the remaining cases, and state conjectures proved for small values of
                                                    parameter.
                                                       Under deformation (quantization) the Poisson Lie superalgebra po(0|2n) on purely odd
                                                    superspace turns into gl(2n−1 |2n−1 ) and, conjecturally, the lowest terms of the Taylor series
                                                    expansion with respect to the deformation parameter (Planck’s constant) of the Casimir
                                                    operators for gl(2n−1 |2n−1 ) are the Casimir operators for po(0|2n).
                                                       Similarly, quantization sends po(0|2n − 1) into q(2n−1 ) and the above procedure makes
                                                    Casimir operators for q(2n−1 ) into same for po(0|2n − 1).
                                                       Casimir operators for the Lie superalgebra vect(0|m) of vector fields on purely odd su-
                                                    perspace are only constants for m > 2. Conjecturally, same is true for the Lie superalgebra
                                                    svect(0|m) of divergence free vector fields, and its deform, for m > 3.
                                                       Invariant polynomials on po(0|2n − 1) are also described. They do not correspond to
                                                    Casimir operators.


                                               This is a version of the paper published in: Ivanov E. et. al. (eds.) Supersymmetries and
                                             Quantum Symmetries (SQS’99, 27–31 July, 1999), Dubna, JINR, 2000, 409–411. Meanwhile
                                             we have understood how to prove our conjecture for vect(0|m) and precisely same idea was
                                             used by Noam Shomron [Sh], who additionally described, to an extent, indecomposable
                                             vect(0|m)-modules. The only difference with the Dubna version is this and similar remarks.
                                               As always, speaking about invariant polynomials on Lie superalgebras (or their duals),
                                             one should bear in mind a more natural from super point of view approach due to Shander
                                             [Sha]: description of nonpolynomial invariant functions. Actually, even in non-super cases
                                             people did consider non-polynomial elements, say, localizations of the enveloping algebras,
                                             but there it does not lead to totally new invariants.

                                             0. Recapitulations. Recall that by the Casimir elements for the Lie algebra or superalge-
                                             bra g we mean the generators of the center Z(g) of U(g). Their applications in description
                                             of physical phenomena are well-known and numerous.
                                                If g possesses an invariant nondegenerate supersymmetric bilinear form B, then g ≃ g∗ .
                                             In this case, the description of the Casimir elements for g is equivalent to the description of
                                             the algebra I(g) of invariant polynomials on g because Z(g) is isomorphic to I(g) (as vector
                                             spaces). To describe I(g) is, however, easier than Z(g). For the most complete description
                                             of I(g) for simple finite dimensional Lie superalgebras and/or their “relatives”, i.e., close to
                                             them “classical” algebras, such as central extensions, etc., see [S1].

   This description of I(g) does not cover q(n), and po(0|m), and their relatives: it is a much
more difficult problem to be solved by other means and ideas than those of [S1].
   Thus, Casimir operators are described at the moment for
   • simple Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix and their “relatives” [S1]; (the first results
are due to Berezin [B] and Kac [K1, K2]);
   • q(n) (but not for relatives), see [S3];
   • pe(n) (no Casimir operators) and spe(n), see [Sch] (implicitely) and [S2] (for n = 3);
now we can refer to an interesting paper of Maria Gorelik [G], where the spe(n)-invariants
are completely and explicitly described (though the author herself does not like the result
and did not even put on arXive, to say nothing about publishing, we find it a very nice one;
it is based on her previous papers [G2]);
   • vect(0|m) (for m > 2), see Shomron’s paper [Sh].
   There remain the following cases:
   • the divergence free sublagebras: the “standard” one, svect(0|m), that preserves the
                                              ^
volume element vol and it deformation svect(0|m)       preserving (1 + θ1 · θm )vol for which,
conjecturally, there are no Casimir operators (for m > 3);
   • sq(n) and psq(n);
   • po(0|m) considered below (but the general proof is still lacking), spo(0|m) as well as
h(0|m) and sh(0|m).
Example 1. For g = gl(n) the Casimir operators corresponding to the first n invariant
polynomials tr(X k ), where X ∈ g, i.e., for k = 1, . . . , n, generate the center of U(g). The
form B is defined by the trace.

Example 2. The Lie superalgebra gl(m|n) is a super analog of gl(n); the form B is defined
by the supertrace. It is known that the center of its universal enveloping algebra is NOT
finitely generated. For the generators we may take str(X k ) for all positive integer values of
k. (A comment: suppose we somehow proved that apart from traces there are no invariant
polynomilas on gl(n). To prove that only finitely many of them generate the algebra, consider
the power series expansion of det(X − λ1n ) with respect to λ. The coefficients of λ are
polynomials in tr(X k ); the characteristic polynomial yields a recursive formula for tr(X n+1 ).
Contrarywise, the superdeterminant, the Berezinian, is a rational function in str(X k ), to
express the Berezinian in terms of supertraces we need all of them.)
   On the other hand, any rational function on gl(m|n) can be expressed as a rational function
of the first n + m supertraces, cf. [S1] with [B] and [K1, K2]).

Example 3. The Lie superalgebra po(0|2n), the Poisson superalgebra, is one more super
analog of gl(n). Indeed, there exists a well-known deformation (quantization) with parameter
~ such that at ~ = 0 we have po(0|2n) whereas at ~ 6= 0 the Lie superalgebras from the
parametric family are isomorphic to gl(2n−1 |2n−1).
  Recall, that the superspace of po(0|2n) is isomorphic to the Grassmann superalgebra on
2n generators ξ, η and the bracket is given by the formula
                                               X  ∂f ∂g    ∂f ∂g
                                                                    
                                         p(f )
                          {f, g} = (−1)                   +           .
                                                   ∂ξi ∂ηi ∂ηi ∂ξi
                                                                        R
The form B on po(0|m) for any m is given by the integral B(f, g) = f g vol, where vol is
the volume element, and, clearly, the following are invariant polynomials on po(0|m):
                                 Z
                            rk = f k vol(ξ, η), where k = 1, 2, . . .                    (∗)

Observe, however, that, unlike gl(m|n) case, these polynomials rk do not generate the whole
algebra of invariant polynomials for n ≥ 2. A counterexample of least degree is given for
n = 2 by the Casimir operator whose radial part is equal to x21 x22 (x21 − x22 ).
  Quantization turns the integral on functions that generate po(0|m) into the supertrace
on supermatrices from gl(2n−1 |2n−1) for m = 2n and into queertrace on the general queer
superalgebra q(2n−1) for m = 2n − 1. This and other   arguments, see [BL], indicates that
                                                           A B
q(n) is one more super analog of gl(n). Recall that qtr                  = trB, see [BL].

Remark . For any Lie superalgebra g and its finite dimensional representation ρ, the poly-
nomials
                                   Pk,ρ = strρ(X)k
are invariant ones. For gl(m|n) any degree k homogeneous invariant polynomial can be
represented as                        X
                                          cρ Pk,ρ,                                    (∗∗)
                                                 ρ
where the sum runs over a finite number of finite dimensional representations, see [S1]. For
Lie superalgebras po(0|2n) the situation is different: when n ≥ 2 and k ≥ 6 the polynomial
(∗) can not be obtained as any finite sum of the form (∗∗), so we have strict inclusions
I(g) ⊃ I(∗) (g) ⊃ I(∗∗) (g), where I(∗) and I(∗∗) are algebras of polynomials of the form (∗) and
(∗∗), respectively.
  To describe the complete set of po(0|2n)-invariants, recall that the Grassmann superalge-
                                                                   ˆ η̂), where
bra C[ξ, η] can be deformed into the Clifford superalgebra Cliff ~(ξ,
                                     ξˆi η̂j + η̂j ξˆi = δij ~.
  For any subset I = {i1 < · · · < il } ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n} set ξI = ξi1 . . . ξil and ηI = ηi1 . . . ηil ;
notations ξˆI and η̂I are similar. Define the linear map Q : C[ξ, η] −→ Cliff ~(ξ,     ˆ η̂) by setting
Q(ξI ηJ ) = ξˆI η̂J ; before applying Q to a monomial one has to reduce it to a normal form,
say, to ξη-form.
4. Lemma . [Q(f ), Q(g)] = ~Q({f, g}) + O(~2 ), where in the left hand side stands the
supercommutator in the Clifford superalgebra, and {·, ·} in the right hand side is the Poisson
bracket.
                                                                             ˆ η̂) is gl(2n−1 |2n−1 );
   The Lie superalgebra associated with the associative superalgebra Cliff ~(ξ,
for it, the invariant polynomials are described above and in [S1]. The Lie superalgebra asso-
ciated with the Clifford superalgebra generated by 2n − 1 elements is q(2n−1 ) (see [L]); for
it, the Casimir elements are described in [S3].
5. Lemma . Let F be an invariant polynomial on Cliff ~ considered as Lie superalgebra,
                                                                                 P i.e.,
       n−1 n−1                       n−1
on gl(2 |2 ) or on its subalgebra q(2 ). Let us represent it in the form F =         Fk ~k .
                                                                                               k≥k0
If P ∈ I(po(0|2n)) is such that Q(P ) = Fk0 , then P is an invariant polynomial on po(0|m).
   In other words, the lowest (with respect to ~-degree) components of invariant polynomials
in the operators, i.e., on gl(2n−1 |2n−1) or q(2n−1), are invariant polynomials in their symbols
— the elements from po(0|m) for m = 2n or 2n − 1, respectively. In particular, it is easy to
see that                                               Z        

6. Conjecture . ([S2]) All the invariant polynomials on po(0|m) for any m (odd as well as
even) may be obtained in the way indicated in Lemma 5.
  This 15 years old conjecture is now proven for m even and ≤ 6. To prove it in full
generality, we need new ideas as compared with those we know and successfully used in [S1]:
here the degree of complexity of computations performed à la [S1] grows steeply with m.
