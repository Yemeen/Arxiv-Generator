                                                  This paper classifies and constructs explicitly all the irreducible representations of affine Hecke
                                             algebras of rank two root systems. The methods used to obtain this classification are primarily
                                             combinatorial and are, for the most part, an application of the methods used in [Ra1]. I have
                                             made special effort to describe how the classification here relates to the classifications by Langlands
                                             parameters (coming from p-adic group theory) and by indexing triples (coming from a q-analogue of
                                             the Springer correspondence). There are several reasons for doing the details of this classification:
                                              (a) The proof of the one of the main results of [Ra1] depends on this classification of representations
                                                  for rank two affine Hecke algebras. Specifically, in the proof of Proposition 4.4 of [Ra1], one
                                                  needs to know exactly which weights can occur in calibrated representations. The reason that
                                                  this naturally depends on a rank two classification is outlined in (d) below.
                                             (b) The examples here illustrate (and clarify) results of [Ra1], [KL], [CG], [BM], [Ev], [Kr], [HO1-
                                                  2]. Much of the power of the combinatorial methods which are now available is evident from
                                                  the calculations in this paper, especially when one compares with the effort needed in other
                                                  sources (for example [Xi], Chapt. 11).
                                              (c) The explicit information here can be very useful for obtaining results on representations of
                                                  p-adic groups (see, for example, [Lu3]).
                                             (d) One hopes that eventually there will be a combinatorial construction of all irreducible repre-
                                                  sentations of all affine Hecke algebras. I expect that such a construction will depend heavily
                                                  on the rank two cases. This idea is analogous to the way that the rank two cases are the
                                                  basic building blocks in the presentations of Coxeter groups by “braid” relations and the
                                                  presentations of Kac-Moody Lie algebras (and quantum groups) by Serre relations.
                                             The first section of this paper is a review of definitions and basic results about affine Hecke algebras
                                             and their representations. A few additional lemmas are proved in order to aid the proofs and con-
                                             structions in later sections. The remainder of the sections detail the classification and construction
                                             of the irreducible representations of affine Hecke algebras of types A1 , A1 × A1 , A2 , C2 and G2 .
                                             In each case I have indicated how the results here relate to the “Langlands classification”, the
                                             classification of Kazhdan and Lusztig [KL], and the results in [Ra1].

only a few, there were discussions with S. Fomin, F. Knop, L. Solomon, M. Vazirani and N. Wallach
which played an important role in my progress. There were several times when I tapped into J.
Stembridge’s fountain of useful knowledge about root systems. D.-N. Verma helped at a crucial
juncture by suggesting that I look at the paper of Steinberg. G. Benkart was a very patient listener
on many occasions. H. Barcelo, P. Deligne, T. Halverson, R. Macpherson and R. Simion all gave
large amounts of time to let me tell them my story and every one of these sessions was helpful to
me in solidifying my understanding.
     I single out Jacqui Ramagge with special thanks for everything she has done to help with
this project: from the most mundane typing and picture drawing to deep intense mathematical
conversations which helped to sort out many pieces of this theory. Her immense contribution is
evident in that some of the papers in this series on representations of affine Hecke algebras are
joint papers.
     A portion of this research was done during a semester long stay at Mathematical Sciences
Research Institute where I was supported by a Postdoctoral Fellowship. I thank MSRI and National
Science Foundation for support of my research.

                               1. Definitions and preliminary results

The Weyl group.          Let R be a reduced irreducible root system in Rn , fix a set of positive
       +
roots R and let {α1 , . . . , αn } be the corresponding simple roots in R. Let W be the Weyl group
corresponding to R. Let si denote the simple reflection in W corresponding to the simple root αi
and recall that W can be presented by generators s1 , s2 , . . . , sn and relations

                                  s2i           =          1,                for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
                             si sj si · · ·     =    sj si sj · · · ,          for i 6= j,

                          mij      factors          mij    factors


where mij = hαi , α∨         ∨         ∨
                   j ihαj , αi i, and αi = 2αi /hαi , αi i.

The Iwahori-Hecke algebra. Fix q ∈ C∗ such that q is not a root of unity. The Iwahori-Hecke
algebra H is the associative algebra over C defined by generators T1 , T2 , . . . , Tn and relations

                           Ti2                = (q − q −1 )Ti + 1,             for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
                       Ti Tj Ti · · ·         =    Tj Ti Tj · · · ,              for i 6= j,            (1.1)

                       mij     factors              mij    factors

where mij are the same as in the presentation of W . For w ∈ W define Tw = Ti1 · · · Tip where
si1 · · · sip = w is a reduced expression for w. By [Bou, Ch. IV §2 Ex. 23], the element Tw does
not depend on the choice of the reduced expression. The algebra H has dimension |W | and the
set {Tw }w∈W is a basis of H.
The group X. The fundamental weights are the elements ω1 , . . . , ωn of Rn given by hωi , α∨
                                                                                            ji =
δij . The weight lattice is the W -invariant lattice in Rn given by
                                                              n
                                                              X
                                                       P =           Zωi .
                                                               i=1

Let X be the abelian group P except written multiplicatively. In other words,

               X = {X λ | λ ∈ P },              and X λ X µ = X λ+µ = X µ X λ ,        for λ, µ ∈ P .
                                       Affine Hecke algebras                                                    3

Let C[X] denote the group algebra of X. There is a W -action on X given by wX λ = X wλ for
w ∈ W , X λ ∈ X, which we extend linearly to a W -action on C[X].
The affine Hecke algebra.            The affine Hecke algebra H̃ associated to R and P is the algebra
given by
                                 H̃ = C-span{Tw X λ | w ∈ W, X λ ∈ X}
where the multiplication of the Tw is as in the Iwahori-Hecke algebra H, the multiplication of the
X λ is as in C[X] and we impose the relation

                                                X λ − X si λ
             X λ Ti = Ti X si λ + (q − q −1 )                ,      for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and X λ ∈ X.               (1.2)
                                                1 − X −αi

This formulation of the definition of H̃ is due to Lusztig [Lu2] following work of Bernstein and
Zelevinsky. The elements Tw X λ , w ∈ W , X λ ∈ X, form a basis of H̃.
Weights. Let
                              T = {group homomorphisms t: X → C∗ }.
                                                                                       −1
The torus T is an abelian group with a W -action given by (wt)(X λ ) = t(X w                λ
                                                                                                ). For any element
t ∈ T define the polar decomposition

               t = tr tc ,       tr , tc ∈ T such that tr (X λ ) ∈ R>0 , and |tc (X λ )| = 1,
                             P
for all X λ ∈ X. Let Q∨ =      i   Zα∨                          n                  n  ∨
                                     i . There is a unique µ ∈ R and a unique ν ∈ R /Q such that


                tr (X λ ) = ehµ,λi       and        tc (X λ ) = e2πihν,λi ,    for all λ ∈ P .               (1.3)

In this way we identify the sets Tr = {t ∈ T | t = tr } and Tc = {t ∈ T | t = tc } with Rn and
Rn /Q∨ , respectively.
Central characters.

Theorem 1.4. (Bernstein, Zelevinsky, Lusztig [Lu1, 8.1]) The center of H̃ is C[X]W = {f ∈
C[X] | wf = f }.

    Since H̃ has countable dimension, Dixmier’s version of Schur’s lemma implies that Z(H̃) acts
on an irreducible H̃-module M by scalars. Let t ∈ T be such that

                                   pM = t(p)M,            for all p ∈ Z(H̃).

Since Z(H̃) = C[X(T )]W it follows that t(p(X)) = (wt)(p(X)) for all w ∈ W . The W -orbit W t of
t is the central character of M . We shall often abuse notation and refer to any weight s ∈ W t as
“the central character” of M .
Weight spaces. Let M be a finite dimensional H̃-module. For each t ∈ T the t-weight space of
M and the generalized t-weight space are the subspaces

            Mt = {m ∈ M | X λ m = t(X λ )m for all X λ ∈ X}                   and


         Mtgen = {m ∈ M | for each X λ ∈ X, (X λ − t(X λ ))k m = 0 for some k ∈ Z>0 },

                                                                  L
respectively. If Mtgen 6= 0 then Mt 6= 0. In general M 6=            t∈T   Mt , but we do have
                                                    M
                                             M=           Mtgen .
                                                    t∈T


This is a decomposition of M into Jordan blocks for the action of C[X]. The set of weights of M
is the set
                                supp(M ) = {t ∈ T | Mtgen 6= 0}.                           (1.5)

The calibration graph. Let t ∈ T . Define a graph Γ(t) with

                         Vertices:        W t,
                           Edges:      wt ←→ si wt,          if     (wt)(X αi ) 6= q ±2 .



Proposition 1.6. ([Ra1] Proposition 2.12) Let M be a finite dimensional irreducible H̃-module
with central character t. Then
                                 dim(Msgen ) = dim(Msgen
                                                      ′  )
if s and s′ are in the same connected component of the calibration graph Γ(t).

    If t ∈ T define

              P (t) = {α > 0 | t(X α ) = q ±2 }      and          Z(t) = {α > 0 | t(X α ) = 1}.    (1.7)

For each subset J ⊆ P (t) define

                       F (t,J) = {w ∈ W | R(w) ∩ Z(t) = ∅, R(w) ∩ P (t) = J },                     (1.8)

where R(w) = {α > 0 | wα < 0} is the inversion set of w. Define a placed shape to be a pair
(t, J ) such that t ∈ T , J ⊆ P (t) and F (t,J) 6= ∅. The elements of the set F (t,J) are called standard
tableaux of shape (t, J ).

Proposition 1.9. ([Ra1] Theorem 2.14) Let t ∈ T . The connected components of the calibration
graph Γ(t) are the sets

                      {wt | w ∈ F (t,J) },   J ⊆ P (t),             such that F (t,J) 6= ∅.



Calibrated representations. A finite dimensional H̃-module M is calibrated if Mtgen = Mt , for
all t ∈ T .

Proposition 1.10. ([Ra1] Proposition 4.2)
(a) An irreducible H̃-module M is calibrated if and only if dim(Mtgen ) = 1 for all weights t of M .
(b) If M is an irreducible H̃-module with regular central character t (i.e. Z(t) = ∅) then M is
    calibrated.

     Let αi and αj be simple roots in R and let Rij be the rank two root subsystem of R which
is generated by αi and αj . Let Wij be the Weyl group of Rij , the subgroup of W generated by
                                        Affine Hecke algebras                                           5

the simple reflections si and sj . A weight t ∈ T is calibratable for Rij if one of the following two
conditions holds:
     (a) t(X α ) 6= 1 for all α ∈ Rij ,
     (b) Rij is of type C2 or G2 (assume that αi is the long root and αj is the short root),
         ut(X αi ) = q 2 and ut(X αj ) = 1 for some u ∈ Wij , and t(X αi ) 6= 1 and t(X αj ) 6= 1.
A placed skew shape is a placed shape (t, J ) such that for all w ∈ F (t,J) and all pairs αi , αj of
simple roots in R the weight wt is calibratable for Rij .

Theorem 1.11. ([Ra1] Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 4.1)
(a) Let (t, J ) be a placed skew shape and let F (t,J) be the set of standard tableaux of shape (t, J ).
    Define
                                   H̃ (t,J) = C-span{vw | w ∈ F (t,J) },
    so that the symbols vw are a labeled basis of the vector space H̃ (t,J) . Then the following
    formulas make H̃ (t,J) into an irreducible H̃-module: For each w ∈ F (t,J) ,

                 X λ vw      = (wt)(X λ )vw ,                                        for X λ ∈ X, and

(b) If M is an irreducible calibrated representation such that supp(M ) = {wt | w ∈ F (t,J) } for
    some placed skew shape (t, J ) then M is isomorphic to the module H̃ (t,J) constructed in (a).


Remark 1.12. It follows from the results of Rodier [Ro] that if M is an irreducible H̃-module
with regular central character (i.e. Z(t) = ∅) then M satisfies the hypothesis of the statement of
Theorem 1.11 (b).


Langlands classification. The following discussion follows the work of Evens [Ev] and [KL,
§8]. For this subsection it is convenient to assume that q ∈ R>0 and q 6= 1. For the general case
see [KL, §8]. Let t ∈ T and let t = tr tc be the polar decomposition of t. Define
                       n
                       X
              ν(t) ∈         Rα∨
                               i      by requiring       tr (X λ ) = q 2hλ,ν(t)i ,    for all λ ∈ P .
                       i=1


A finite dimensional H̃-module M is tempered if for all weights t of M (as defined in (1.5)) we have

                                    hωi , ν(t)i ≤ 0,     for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

The module M is square integrable if hωi , ν(t)i < 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and all weights t of M .
     Let I be a subset of the simple roots and let H̃I be the subalgebra of H̃ generated by Ti , i ∈ I,
and all X λ ∈ X. We shall say that a finite dimensional H̃I -module is tempered if I is the maximal
set such that for all weights t of M ,

                                      hωi , ν(t)i ≤ 0,      for all i ∈ I.

Theorem 1.13. (see [Ev]) Let I ⊆ {1, 2 . . . , n} and let T be an irreducible tempered representation
of H̃I .
(a) MT ,I = IndH̃
               H̃I
                   (T ) has a unique irreducible quotient LT ,I .
(b) Every irreducible H̃-module is isomorphic to LT ,I for some pair (T , I).
(c) If LT ,I ∼
             = LT ′ ,I ′ then I = I ′ and T ∼
                                            = T ′ as H̃I -modules.

The Langlands parameters of an irreducible H̃-module M are given by the pair (T , I) specified by
Theorem 1.13 (b).
Classification by indexing triples. Kazhdan and Lusztig [KL] (see also the important work
of Ginzburg [CG]) gave a refinement of the Langlands classification. Let G be the simple complex
algebraic group with root system R and weight lattice P . An indexing triple (s, u, ρ) consists of

                    a semisimple element s ∈ G,                                     2
                                                           such that     sus−1 = uq ,
                    a unipotent element u ∈ G,

and an irreducible representation ρ of the component group A(s, u) = ZG (s, u)/ZG (s, u)◦ , where
ZG (s, u) = ZG (s) ∩ ZG (u). Let K(Bs,u ) be the K-theory of the variety

                      Bs,u = {Borel subgroups of G containing both s and u}.

By a theorem of Lusztig [Lu4] K(Bs,u ) is an H̃-module. The group A(s, u) also acts on K(Bs,u )
and this action commutes with the action of H̃. The standard modules Ms,u,ρ are the H̃-modules
given by the decomposition                    M
                                  K(Bs,u ) =     Ms,u,ρ ⊗ ρ,
                                                       ρ

where the sum is over all irreducible representations of A(s, u).

Theorem 1.14. [KL]
(a) If Ms,u,ρ 6= 0 then it has a unique simple quotient Ls,u,ρ .
(b) Every simple H̃-module isomorphic to some Ls,u,ρ .
(c) If Ls,u,ρ ∼
              = Ls′ ,u′ ,ρ′ then there is a g ∈ G such that s′ = gsg −1 , u′ = gug −1 , and ρ′ = ρ.

     In this way each irreducible H̃-module corresponds to a unique (up to conjugation) indexing
triple. One can replace u by n = ln u in the Lie algebra g = Lie(G) (see [CG, Ch. 8]) so that an
indexing triple is

                   a semisimple element s ∈ G,
                                                           such that    Ad(s)n = q 2 n,
                    a nilpotent element n ∈ g,

and an irreducible representation ρ of the component group A(s, n) = ZG (s, n)/ZG (s, n)◦ , where
ZG (s, n) = ZG (s) ∩ ZG (n) and ZG (n) is taken with respect to the adjoint action of G on g. We
will use this form of the indexing triples in the examples in later sections.
Principal series modules.         Let t ∈ T and let Cvt be the one dimensional C[X]-module
corresponding to the character t: X → C∗ . Specifically, Cvt is the one dimensional vector space
with basis {vt } and C[X]-action given by

                                X λ vt = t(X λ )vt ,       for all X λ ∈ X.

The principal series module corresponding to t is the H̃-module

                                            M (t) = IndH̃
                                                       CX (Cvt ).


Theorem 1.15. [Ma]
(a) Every irreducible H̃-module M with central character t is a composition factor of the principal
    series module M (t).
(b) If w ∈ W and t ∈ T then M (t) and M (wt) have the same composition factors.

Theorem 1.16. (Kato’s irreducibility criterion [Ka]) Let t ∈ T and let P (t) = {α > 0 | t(X α ) =
q ±2 }. The principal series module M (t) is irreducible if and only if P (t) = ∅.

Remark. Kato actually proves a more general result and thus needs a further condition for
irreducibility. We have simplified matters by specifying the weight lattice P in our construction of
the affine Hecke algebra. One can use any W -invariant lattice in Rn and Kato works in this more
general situation. When the one uses the weight lattice P , a result of Steinberg [St, 4.2, 5.3] says
that the stabilizer Wt of a point t ∈ T under the action of W is always a reflection group. Because
of this Kato’s criterion takes a simpler form.
Weights of induced modules. If I ⊆ {1, . . . , n} define H̃I to be the subalgebra of H̃ generated
by Ti , i ∈ I, and all X λ ∈ X.

Lemma 1.17. Let t ∈ T such that t(X αi ) = q 2 for all i ∈ I and let Cvt be the one dimensional
H̃I -module with basis {vt } and H̃I -action given by

               Ti vt = qvt ,   for i ∈ I,   and           X λ vt = t(X λ )vt ,     for all X λ ∈ X.

Let W/WI be the set of minimal length coset representatives of cosets of WI in W . Then the
weights of the H̃-module M = IndH̃
                                H̃I
                                    (Cvt ) are wt, w ∈ W/WI , and

                             gen
                        dim(Mwt  ) = (# of u ∈ W/WI such that ut = wt).


Proof. The module M has basis {Tw ⊗ vt | w ∈ W/WI }. By writing Tw = Ti1 · · · Tip for a reduced
word w = si1 . . . sip and inductively using the defining relation (1.2) we get
                                               −1                       X
                      X λ (Tw ⊗ vt ) = t(X w        λ
                                                        )(Tw ⊗ vt ) +         av (t)(Tv ⊗ vt )
                                                                        v<w
                                                                        X
                                     = (wt)(X λ )(Tw ⊗ vt ) +                 av (t)(Tv ⊗ vt ),
                                                                        v<w


where the sum is over v ∈ W which are less than w in Bruhat order and av (t) ∈ C. This shows
that the eigenvalues of X λ on M are (wt)(X λ ). The result follows by counting the multiplicity of
each eigenvalue.

The τ operators. The maps τi : Mtgen → Msgen    it
                                                   defined below are local operators on M in the
sense that they act on each weight space Mtgen of M separately. The operator τi is only defined
on weight spaces Mtgen such that t(X αi ) 6= 1.

Lemma 1.19. Let t ∈ T such that t(X αi ) = 1 and suppose that M is an H̃-module such that
Mtgen 6= 0. Let Wt be the stabilizer of t under the action of W on T . Assume that w̄ ∈ W/Wt is
such that t and w̄t are in the same connected component of Γ(t). Let w be a minimal length coset
representative of w̄. Then
                 gen
     (a) dim(Mwt     ) ≥ 2, and
     (b) If Msgen

Proof. Let M (t) be the two dimensional principal series module for the affine Hecke algebra H̃A1
of type A1 (see §2 central character to ). Then M (t) = M (t)gen
                                                             t   and has basis {vt , T1 vt }. Let nt be
a nonzero weight vector in Mt . There is a unique H̃A1 -module homomorphism

                                                 M (t) −→ M
                                                  vt   7−→ nt

where we view M as an H̃A1 -module by restriction to the parabolic subalgebra H̃{i} ⊆ H̃. This
homomorphism must be an injection since M (t) is irreducible. Thus the vectors nt , Ti nt span a
two dimensional subspace of Mtgen and X λ ∈ X acts on this subspace by the matrix
                                                                                        
                                      λ           λ            1   (q − q −1 )hλ, α∨
                                                                                   i i
                              φt (X ) = t(X )                                                .
                                                               0           1

   Let w = si1 · · · sip be a reduced expression of w. Since t and wt are in the same connected
component of Γ(t) we can use Proposition 1.18 (c) to show that the map
                                                                     gen
                                      τw = τi1 · · · τip : Mtgen −→ Mwt

is well defined and bijective. Thus the vectors τw nt , τw Ti nt span a two dimensional subspace of
   gen
Mwt    and, by Proposition 1.18 (b) X λ ∈ X acts on this subspace by the matrix
                                                                                                

Irreducible representations. Table 2.1 lists the irreducible H̃-modules by their central char-
acters. The sets P (t) and Z(t) are as given in (1.7) and correspond to the choice of representative
for the central character displayed in Figure 2.1. The Langlands parameters usually consist of
a pair (T , I) where I is a subset of {1} and T is a tempered representation for the parabolic
subalgebra H̃I . In our cases the tempered representation T of H̃I is completely determined by
a character t ∈ T . Specifically, T is the only tempered representation of H̃I which has t as a
weight. In the labeling in Table 2.1 we have replaced the representation T by the weight t. The
nilpotent element eα1 is a representative of the root space gα1 for the Lie algebra g = sl2 . For each
calibrated module with central character t we have listed the subset J ⊆ P (t) such that (t, J ) is
the corresponding placed skew shape (see Theorem 1.11). The abbreviation ‘nc’ indicates modules
that are not calibrated.

dimensional to conclude that Cva and Cvs1 a are the only irreducible representations of H̃ with

Central character tb : By Theorem 1.15 and Kato’s irreducibility criterion, Theorem 1.16, the
only irreducible representation with central character tb is the principal series module M (tb ).
Alternatively, this module can be constructed by applying Theorem 1.11 to the placed skew shape

Irreducible representations. Table 4.1 lists the irreducible H̃-modules by their central char-
acters. The sets P (t) and Z(t) are as given in (1.7) and correspond to the choice of representative

In the labeling in Table 4.1 we have replaced the representation T by the weight t. The nilpotent

                    Figure 4.1. Real parts of central characters in Table 4.1

Tempered and square integrable representations. The tempered (resp. square integrable)
H̃-modules are the ones which have the real parts of all their weights in the closure (resp. interior)
of the shaded region of Figure 4.2. Let t ∈ T be given by t(X −α1 ) = ±q, t(X −α2 ) = ±q. This is
a special case of the central character tb in Table 4.1. For this particular special case there is one
tempered representation with central character t.

representations are indexed by the partitions (3), (21), (13) of 3. Equivalently, they can be indexed
by the pairs (n, ρ) which appear in the Springer correspondence. The n and ρ will also be elements
of the indexing triple for the corresponding tempered representation of H̃. Here n is a nilpotent
element of the Lie algebra g = sl3 and ρ is an irreducible representation of the component group
ZG (n)/ZG (n)◦ . In type A the component group is always trivial. For each root β ∈ R let eβ be
an element of the root space gβ . The three nilpotent orbits in g and the corresponding tempered
representations of H̃ are as in Table 4.2.

The analysis.
Central characters ta , tb , tg : Since Z(t) = ∅ these weights are regular. Thus the representations
corresponding to these central characters are in one to one correspondence with the connected
components of the calibration graph Γ(t) and can be constructed explicitly with the use of Theorem
1.11. Up to isomorphism the principal series module M (tg ) is the only irreducible H̃-module with
central character tg . The Langlands parameters for each module can be determined from its weight
structure and the indexing triple is then determined from the Langlands data by using the induction
theorem of Kazhdan and Lusztig (see the discusssion in [BM, p.34]).
     There is one special case of the central character tb when the irreducible module constructed
by applying Theorem 1.11 to the placed skew shape (tb , ∅) is tempered. This happens when
tb = s2 s1 t for the weight t ∈ T given by t(X −α1 ) = ±q, t(X −α2 ) = ±q. The indexing triple and
the calibration set for this case are still given by (tb , eα2 , 1) and J = {α2 }, respectively.

Central characters tc and td : One can use the defining relations of H̃ to check that the only
1-dimensional representations of H̃ are the ones with central character ta . Construct two 3-
dimensional representations of H̃ by

                              IndH̃
                                 H̃{2}
                                       (Cvc )         and         IndH̃
                                                                     H̃{2}
                                                                           (Cvs2 c ),

where Cvc and Cvs2 c are the two one-dimensional representations of H̃{2} given by

                    T2 vc = qvc ,                 X α1 vc = vc ,               X α2 vc = q 2 vc ,

                T2 vs2 c = −q −1 vs2 c ,       X α1 vs2 c = q 2 vs2 c ,     X α2 vs2 c = q −2 vs2 c .

These representations must be irreducible since, if not, they would either have a 1-dimensional
submodule or a one dimensional quotient. But there are no 1-dimensional modules with central
character tc .
     The central characters tc and td are taken into each other under the automorphism of the
Dynkin diagram of A2 which switches the two nodes and thus these two central characters will
produce modules which have the same structure (up to twisting by the automorphism which
switches α1 and α2 ). Thus the representations with central character td can be obtained from the
ones with central character tc by switching all 1’s and 2’s and changing all c’s to d’s.
Central characters te and tf : Since P (te ) = ∅, Kato’s irreducibility criterion (Theorem 1.16)
implies that the principal series module M (te ) is irreducible. By Theorem 1.15 this is the only
irreducible with central character te . As for the case of tc and td , the central characters te and
tf are taken into each other under the automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of A2 . Thus the
irreducible representations with central character tf can be obtained from the one with central
character te by switching all 1’s and 2’s and changing all e’s to f ’s.
Central character to : Since P (to ) = ∅, Kato’s irreducibility criterion (Theorem 1.16) implies that
the principal series module M (to ) is irreducible. By Theorem 1.15 this is the only irreducible with
central character to .

                       1i   = −1,          ω2 = 12 α1 + α2 ,                   α2 = −ω1 + 2ω2 .


Irreducible representations. Table 5.1 lists the irreducible H̃-modules by their central char-
acters. We have listed only those central characters t for which the principal series module M (t)
is not irreducible (see Theorem 1.16). The sets P (t) and Z(t) are as given in (1.7) and correspond
to the choice of representative for the central character displayed in Figure 5.1. The Langlands
parameters usually consist of a pair (T , I) where I is a subset of {1, 2} and T is a tempered rep-
resentation for the parabolic subalgebra H̃I . In our cases the tempered representation T of H̃I is
completely determined by a character t ∈ T . Specifically, T is the only tempered representation
of H̃I which has t as a weight. In the labeling in Table 5.1 we have replaced the representation T
by the weight t. The notation for the nilpotent elements in the indexing triples is as in Table 5.2.
For each calibrated module with central character t we have listed the subset J ⊆ P (t) such that

modules that are not calibrated.

                    Table 5.1. Irreducible (non principal series) representations

     Figure 5.1 displays the real parts of the central characters in Table 5.1. If t ∈ T then the
polar decomposition t = tr tc determines an element µ ∈ Rn such that tr (X λ ) = ehλ,µi (see (1.3)).
For each central character tp the point labeled by p in Figure 5.1 is the graph of the corresponding
µp ∈ Rn . Assume (for pictorial convenience) that q is a positive real number and let

            Hβ = {x ∈ Rn | hβ, xi = 0},        and          Hβ±δ = {x ∈ Rn | hβ, xi = ln(q ±2 )},

for each positive root β. The dotted lines display the (affine) hyperplanes Hβ±δ .

     The irreducible tempered representations with real central character can be indexed by the
irreducible representations of the Weyl group W of type C2 (see [BM, p. 34]). Equivalently, these
representations can be indexed by the pairs (n, ρ) which appear in the Springer correspondence.
The n and ρ will also be elements of the indexing triple for the corresponding tempered repre-
sentation of H̃. Here n is a nilpotent element of the Lie algebra g = Lie(G), G is the complex
simple group over C of type C2 and ρ is an irreducible representation of the component group
ZG (n)/ZG (n)◦ (see [Ca]). For each root β ∈ R let eβ be an element of the root space gβ . The four
nilpotent orbits in g and the corresponding tempered representations of H̃ are as in Table 5.2. We
have used the notation of Carter [Ca, p.424] to label the irreducible representations of the Weyl
group.

The only other tempered representation is the square integrable representation (tc , eα1 +eα1 +2α2 , 1).
This representation does not have real central character. It is the representation constructed in
[Lu3, 4.14, 4.23]. (In Lusztig’s notation it is the star of the representation corresponding to the
graph G ′ ⊕ G ′′ .)

The analysis. A general calculation with the defining relations of H̃ shows that there are only
four one dimensional H̃-modules Cv1 , Cv2 , Cv3 , and Cv4 which have weights ta , s2 s1 tb , s1 tb and
s1 s2 s1 s2 ta , respectively. These modules are given explicitly by

             T1 v1 = qv1 ,            T2 v1 = qv1 ,                                                                X α1 v1 = q 2 v1 ,                                      X α2 v1 = q 2 v1 ,
             T1 v2 = qv2 ,          T2 v2 = −q −1 v2 ,                                                             X α1 v2 = q 2 v2 ,                                      X α2 v2 = q −2 v2 ,
           T1 v3 = −q −1 v3 ,         T2 v3 = qv3 ,                                                                X α1 v3 = q −2 v3 ,                                     X α2 v3 = q 2 v3 ,
           T1 v4 = −q −1 v4 ,       T2 v4 = −q −1 v4 ,                                                             X α1 v4 = q −2 v4 ,                                     X α2 v4 = q −2 v4 .

Central character ta : Since Z(ta ) = ∅, ta is regular and thus all irreducible representations with
central character ta are calibrated. They are in one to one correspondence with the connected
components of the calibration graph and can be constructed with the use of Theorem 1.11. The
Langlands parameters for each module can be determined from its weight structure and the in-
dexing triple is then determined from the Langlands data by using the induction theorem of
Kazhdan-Lusztig (see the discussion in [BM, p.34]).
Central character tb : We already know from our general computation above, that there are two
one-dimensional H̃-modules with central character tb . One has weight s1 tb and the other has
weight s2 s1 tb . Let Cvb and Cvs1 b be the one dimensional representations of H̃{1} given by

                      T1 vb = qvb ,                     X α1 vb = q 2 vb ,                                                                                          X α2 vb = vb ,
                  T1 vs1 b = −q −1 vs1 b ,            X α1 vs1 b = q −2 vs1 b ,                                                                                  X α2 vs1 b = q 2 vs1 b .

Let
                        M1 = IndH̃
                                H̃{1}
                                      (Cvb )                                          and                                             M2 = IndH̃
                                                                                                                                              H̃{1}
                                                                                                                                                    (Cvs1 b ).

By Lemma 1.17 these modules have weights supp(M1 ) = {tb , s1 tb , s2 s1 tb } and supp(M2 ) = {s1 tb ,
s2 s1 tb , s1 s2 s1 tb }, respectively. Both M1 and M2 are 4 dimensional. By Proposition 1.18 (c) one
of the two operators τ2 : (M1 )s2 s1 tb → (M1 )s1 tb or τ2 : (M1 )s1 tb → (M1 )s2 s1 tb must have nonzero
kernel. This implies that M1 has either a 3 dimensional submodule or a 3 dimensional quotient,
call it N1 , with weights {tb , s1 tb }. By Lemma 1.19, any module P with weights {tb , s1 tb } must
have dim(Ptgen    b
                      ) ≥ 2 and dim(Psgen
                                        1 tb
                                             ) ≥ 1. It follows that N1 is irreducible. A similar argument can
be used to show that M2 has either a 3 dimensional submodule or a 3-dimensional quotient which
must be irreducible.
      The representation N1 constructed in the previous paragraph and the 1 dimensional repre-
sentation with weight s1 tb are both tempered. One obtains the corresponding indexing triples by
comparing the Langlands parameters for these modules with the labelings of the corresponding
representations of W in the Springer correspondence. See [Ca, p.424], [BM, p. 34] and Table 5.2.

Central character tc : Since Z(tc ) = ∅, tc is regular and thus all irreducible representations with
central character tc are calibrated. They are in one to one correspondence with the connected
components of the calibration graph and can be constructed with the use of Theorem 1.11. The
Langlands parameters for each module can be determined from its weight structure. The only
representation for which the indexing triple cannot be determined from the Langlands parameters
and the [KL] induction theorem (see the discussion in [BM, p. 34]) is the tempered representation.
This representation is constructed in [Lu3, 4.14 and 4.23]. In Lusztig’s notation, it is the star (see
[Lu3,4.23]) of the representation corresponding to the graph G ′ ⊕ G ′′ . The indexing triple for this
representation is given in the discussion for B2 in [Lu3, 2.10].
Central character td : Let Cvd and Cvs2 d be the one dimensional representations of H̃{2} given by

                      T2 vd = qvd ,               X α1 vd = vd ,             X α2 vd = q 2 vd ,
                 T2 vs2 d = −q −1 vs2 d ,      X α1 vs2 d = q 4 vs2 d ,    X α2 vs2 d = q −2 vs2 d .

Let
                        M1 = IndH̃
                                H̃{2}
                                      (Cvd )           and        M2 = IndH̃
                                                                          H̃{2}

By Lemma 1.17 these modules have weights supp(M1 ) = {td , s2 td , s1 s2 td } and supp(M2 ) =
{s2 td , s1 s2 td , s2 s1 s2 td }, respectively. Both M1 and M2 are 4 dimensional.

hα2 , α1 i 6= 0 it follows from Lemma 1.19 (b) that dim(Ms2 td ) ≥ 1. Then, by Proposition 1.6,
dim(Msgen  1 s2 td

irreducible. An analogous argument can be applied to conclude that M2 is irreducible.

By Lemma 1.17 these modules have weights supp(M1 ) = {te , s2 te } and supp(M2 ) = {s1 te , s2 s1 te }

                  Table 6.1. Irreducible (non principal series) representations

Table 6.1 lists the irreducible H̃-modules by their central characters. We have listed only those
central characters t for which the principal series module M (t) is not irreducible (see Theorem
22                                             arun ram

1.16). The sets P (t) and Z(t) are as given in (1.7) and correspond to the choice of representative
for the central character displayed in Figure 6.1. The Langlands parameters usually consist of
a pair (T , I) where I is a subset of {1, 2} and T is a tempered representation for the parabolic
subalgebra H̃I . In our cases the tempered representation T of H̃I is completely determined by a
character t ∈ T . Specifically, T is the only tempered representation of H̃I which has t as a weight.
In the labeling in Table 6.1 we have replaced the representation T by the weight t. The notation
for the nilpotent elements in the indexing triples is as in Table 6.3.
     Table 6.2 lists the irreducible calibrated H̃-modules. For each module with central character
t we have listed the subset J ⊆ P (t) such that (t, J ) is the corresponding placed skew shape (see
Theorem 1.11). We have listed only those central characters t for which the principal series module
M (t) is not irreducible (see Theorem 1.16).

polar decomposition t = tr tc determines an element ν ∈ Rn such that tr (X λ ) = ehν,λi (see (1.3)).
For each central character tp the point labeled by p in Figure 6.1 is the graph of the corresponding
νp ∈ Rn . Assume (for pictorial convenience) that q is a positive real number and let

                                              Figure 6.1. Real parts of central characters in Table 6.1
Tempered and square integrable representations. The irreducible tempered representations
with real central character can be indexed by the irreducible representations of the Weyl group W
of type G2 (see [BM, p. 34]). Equivalently, these representations can be indexed by the pairs (n, ρ)
which appear in the Springer correspondence. The n and ρ will also be elements of the indexing
triple for the corresponding tempered representation of H̃. Here n is a nilpotent element of the
Lie algebra g = Lie(G), G is the complex simple group over C of type G2 and ρ is an irreducible
representation of the component group ZG (n)/ZG (n)◦ (see [Ca]). For each root β ∈ R let eβ be
an element of the root space gβ . The five nilpotent orbits in g and the corresponding tempered
representations of H̃ are as in Table 6.3. The notation S3 denotes the symmetric group on three
elements, which has irreducible representations indexed by the partitions (3), (21), (13) of 3. We
have used the notation of Carter [Ca, p.427] to label the irreducible representations of the Weyl
group W of type G2 .

The only other tempered representations are the representations labeled by the triples (tc , eα1 +
eα1 +3α2 , 1) and (td , eα1 + eα1 +2α2 , 1). These representations are square integrable but do not have
real central character.
       The modules labeled by (tc , eα1 + eα1 +3α2 , 1), (td , eα1 + eα1 +2α2 , 1), (te , eα1 + eα1 +2α2 , (3)),
(te , eα1 + eα1 +2α2 , (21)) are the ones constructed by Lusztig in [Lu3] 4.20, 4.19, 4.7 and 4.22
respectively. In Lusztig’s notation these are the stars (see [Lu3, 4.23]) of the modules labeled by
the graphs G ′′ , G ′ , G and G ′′′ , respectively.

The analysis.
Central characters ta , tb , tc , td , th : The central characters te , tf , tg , ti and tj are the only ones
which have both Z(t) and P (t) nonempty. The other cases are handled by Theorem 1.16 and
Theorem 1.11 as in the cases of central characters ta , tb , tg and to for type A2 .
       The Langlands parameters for each module can be determined from its weight structure.
The indexing triple is determined from the Langlands data by using the induction theorem of
Kazhdan and Lusztig (see the discussion in [BM, p.34]). Let us give an example to illustrate
the procedure. The Langlands parameters (s1 s2 tc , {1}) for the 4 dimensional representation with
central character tc correspond to the indexing triple (s2 tc , eα1 , 1) which is conjugate to the triple
(tc , s2 eα1 , 1) = (tc , eα1 +3α2 , 1).
       The indexing triples for the tempered representations cannot be determined with the use of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig induction theorem. The indexing triples for the tempered representations with
real central character are determined from the Springer correspondence, see Table 6.3 and [BM,
p.34]. The two tempered representations with central characters tc and td do not have real central
character. By the last two sentences of [Lu3, 2.10] we know that the indexing triples for these
representations contain the subregular nilpotent and that the component groups are isomorphic
to Z/3Z and Z/2Z respectively. In both cases the component group acts trivially on K(Bs,u ) and
so ρ = 1. The fact that the elements eα1 + eα1 +3α2 and eα1 + eα1 +2α2 are representatives of the
subregular nilpotent orbit can be derived from the analysis in [Ja, Theorem 4.40] or [Sh]. This
determines the triples (tc , eα1 + eα1 +3α2 , 1) and (td , eα1 + eα1 +2α2 , 1).
Central character te : Theorem 1.11 applied to the placed skew shapes (te , {α1 , α1 +α2 }), (te , {α1 })
and (te , {α1 , α1 + α2 , α1 + 2α2 }) produces, respectively, a two dimensional irreducible module M
with supp(M ) = {s2 s1 te , s1 s2 s1 te }, a one dimensional irreducible module N with supp(N ) =
{s1 te } and a one dimensional irreducible module N ∗ with supp(N ∗ ) = {s2 s1 s2 s1 te }. Lusztig
[Lu3] Theorem 4.7 constructs a 3-dimensional irreducible H̃-module P with dim(Ptgen            e
                                                                                                   ) = 2 and
        gen
dim(Ps1 te ) = 1. In Lusztig’s notation this is the module labeled by the graph G for G̃2 .
      As described in [Lu3, 4.23] we can twist the module P by an involutive automorphism of
H̃ to obtain another 3-dimensional irreducible module P ∗ which has dim((P ∗ )gen    s2 s1 s2 s1 te ) = 2 and
         ∗ gen
dim((P )s1 s2 s1 s2 s1 te ) = 1.
      All of the modules M , N , P , N ∗ , P ∗ must appear as composition factors of the principal series
module M (te ). By comparing dimensions of weight spaces, any other module Q which appears
in a composition series of M (te ) must have supp(Q) ⊆ {s2 s1 te , s1 s2 s1 te }. Theorem 1.11(b) then
implies that Q must be isomorphic to M . Thus Theorem 1.15 implies that M , N , P , N ∗ , and P ∗
are (up to isomorphism) all the irreducible modules with central character te .
      The Langlands parameters for each module are determined from its weight structure. The
Kazhdan-Lusztig induction theorem allows us to use the Langlands parameters to determine the
26                                                    arun ram

indexing triples for the modules which are not tempered. Since te is a real central character the
indexing triples for the tempered representations can be determined from the Springer correspon-
dence, see Table 6.3. Alternatively, one can get these triples from [Lu3, 2.10] where it is explained
that the nilpotent in the indexing triple is subregular, the variety Bs,u (where s = te and u is
subregular) consists of three disjoint points and a projective line, and the component group is
isomorphic to the symmetric group S3 . The symmetric group S3 acts trivially on the line and per-
mutes the three points, which implies that the line corresponds to ρ = (3) (trivial representation
of S3 ) and the three points are split between the isotypic components ρ = (3) and ρ = (21). In
this case the standard module Ms,u,(13 ) = 0. The projective line in Bs,u corresponds to the two
dimensional weight space (P ∗ )gen
                               te in the module P .

                                                                         H̃{1}
                                                                               (Cvs1 f ).
By Lemma 1.17 these modules have weights supp(M1 ) = {s2 tf , tf , s1 tf , s2 s1 tf } and supp(M2 ) =
{s1 tf , s2 s1 tf , s1 s2 s1 tf , s2 s1 s2 s1 tf } respectively. Both M1 and M2 are 6 dimensional.
      Let M be any H̃-module such that Ms2 tf 6= 0. By Lemma 1.19 and Proposition 1.6,
dim(Mtgen f
              ) = dim(Msgen      2 tf
                                      ) ≥ 2. Since hs2 α1 , α∨                     ∨
                                                                1 i = hα1 + 3α2 , α1 i 6= 0 it follows from Lemma
                             gen                                                gen
1.19 (b) that dim(Ms1 tf ) ≥ 1. Then, by Proposition 1.6, dim(Ms2 s1 tf ) ≥ 1. Adding these numbers
up we see that dim(M ) ≥ 6. It follows that M1 is irreducible. An analogous argument can be
applied to conclude that M2 is irreducible.
Central character tg : Let Cvg and Cvs1 g be the one dimensional representations of H̃{1} given by
                     T1 vg = qvg ,             X α1 vg = q 2 vg ,           X 2α2 vg = q −2 vg ,
                 T1 vs1 g = −q −1 vs1 g ,     X vs1 g = q −2 vs1 g ,
                                                α1
                                                                           X 2α2 vs1 g = q 2 vs1 g .
Let
                         M1 = IndH̃
                                 H̃{1}
                                       (Cvg )         and        M2 = IndH̃
                                                                         H̃{1}
                                                                               (Cvs1 g ).
By Lemma 1.17 these modules have weights supp(M1 ) = {s1 s2 tg , s2 tg , tg } and supp(M2 ) =
{s1 tg , s2 s1 tg , s1 s2 s1 tg } respectively. Both M1 and M2 are 6 dimensional.
      Let M be any H̃-module such that Ms1 s2 tg 6= 0. By Lemma 1.19 and Proposition 1.6,
dim(Mtgen g
              ) = dim(Msgen      2 tg
                                      ) = dim(Msgen
                                                 1 s2 tg
                                                         ) ≥ 2. Thus dim(M ) ≥ 6. It follows that M1 is irre-
ducible. An analogous argument can be applied to conclude that M2 is irreducible.
Central character ti : Let Cvi and Cvs2 i be the one dimensional representations of H̃{2} given by
                       T2 vi = qvi ,            X α1 vi = vi ,             X α2 vi = q 2 vi ,
                   T2 vs2 i = −q −1 vs2 i ,    X vs2 i = q 6 vs2 i ,
                                                 α1
                                                                          X vs2 i = q −2 vs2 i .
                                                                            α2

Let
                         M1 = IndH̃
                                 H̃{2}
                                       (Cvi )         and        M2 = IndH̃
                                                                         H̃{2}
                                                                               (Cvs2 i ).
An argument similar to that for the central character tf shows that M1 and M2 are irreducible.
Central character tj : Let Cvj and Cvs2 j be the one dimensional representations of H̃{2} given by
                      T2 vj = qvj ,            X 2α1 vj = q −6 vj ,        X α2 vj = q 2 vj ,
                  T2 vs2 j = −q −1 vs2 j ,    X 2α1 vs2 j = q 6 vs2 j ,   X vs2 j = q −2 vs2 j .
                                                                             α2

Let
                         M1 = IndH̃
                                 H̃{2}
                                       (Cvj )         and        M2 = IndH̃
                                                                         H̃{2}
                                                                               (Cvs2 j ).
An argument similar to that for the central character tg shows that M1 and M2 are irreducible.
