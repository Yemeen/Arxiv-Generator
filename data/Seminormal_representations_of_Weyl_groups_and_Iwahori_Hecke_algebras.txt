                                Abstract
     The purpose of this paper is to describe a general procedure for com-
puting analogues of Young's seminormal representations of the symmetric
groups. The method is to generalize the Jucys-Murphy elements in the group
algebras of the symmetric groups to arbitrary Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke
algebras. The combinatorics of these elements allows one to compute irre-
ducible representations explicitly and often very easily. In this paper we
do these computations for Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types
An, Bn, Dn, G2 . Although these computations are in reach for types F4,
E6, and E7, we shall, in view of the length of the current paper, postpone
this to another work.

                            0. Introduction
    This paper is an attempt to simplify, unify, review, and expand the
theory of seminormal representations of the symmetric groups. It is my
hope that the material in this paper will be clear enough and general enough
to dispel some of the mystique of this subject. I would suggest that the
reader begin with section 3, the symmetric group case, and go back and pick
up the generalities from sections 1 and 2 as they are needed. This will make

the motivation for the material in the earlier sections much more clear and
the further examples in the later sections very easy.
     In such a subject, where the credit for the discoveries has been tradi-
tionally complicated and mixed up, it is dicult to claim credit for much
of anything. I believe that my general approach to seminormal representa-
tions of Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke algebras given in sections 1 and 2
of this paper is new, at least nobody explained it to me before. If this was
the structure motivating the work of Hoefsmit [H], then he certainly didn't
give any hint of it, he produced the seminormal representations out of thin
air and then proved that they were correct. I believe that my realization
that the Jucys-Murphy elements are coming from the very natural central
elements in (2.1) and Proposition (2.4) is new. I also think that before this
paper nobody has realized that there is a simple concrete connection (Propo-
sition (2.8)) between Jucys-Murphy type elements in Iwahori-Hecke algebras
and Jucys-Murphy elements in group algebras of Weyl groups (even for the
special cases). I know that the analogues of the Jucys-Murphy elements in
Weyl groups of types B and D will be new to some of the experts and known
to others. These Jucys-Murphy elements for types B and D are not new,
similar elements appear in the paper of Cherednik [Ch], but I was not able
to recognize them there until they were pointed out to me by M.L. Nazarov.
I extend my thanks to him for this. Some people were asking me for Jucys-
Murphy elements in type G2 as late as June of 1995. In July 1995 I was
told that it was unknown how to quantize the elements of Cherednik, i.e.
nd analogues of them in the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types B and D. Of
course, this has been done already in 1974, by Hoefsmit.
     The idea behind my approach to seminormal representations is as old
as representation theory, it is the same method that gives us Gelfand-Tsetlin
bases, and that is often used to nd the representations of centralizer algebras
and operator algebras.
     I would also like to point out that there is a theory of seminormal rep-
resentations and Jucys-Murphy elements for centralizer algebras as well. In
the case of the Brauer centralizer algebra the analogues of the Jucys-Murphy
elements are due to M.L. Nazarov [Na], and in the case of the Birman-Wenzl
algebra to N. Reshetikhin [Re] and R. Leduc and the author [LR]. In the
theory of centralizer algebras the Jucys-Murphy elements \come from" the
Casimir element of the centralizing Lie algebra or quantum group.
The mystique
    Unfortunately, the theory of seminormal representations of the sym-
metric group is a theory which, over the years, has developed quite a bit
Seminormal representations                                                   3
of mystique. I suppose that this began with the fact that Alfred Young's
original work was hard to read and because he was somewhat \in the wrong
place at the right time" in that his work was competing with the work of
Frobenius. Today there are very few people that have carefully read Young's
work and even those people complain about the writing, the notation, and
the general mysteriousness. The second major complicating factor was that
Hoefsmit's thesis was never published. The result of this was that several
people rediscovered parts of his work and giving credit for who did what
when became very dicult.
     Jucys, and later Murphy, introduced some very special elements that
had the chance of making everything in theory of seminormal representations
much more simple and clear. This was not to be. The original work of
Jucys ([Ju1-3] 1966, 1971, 1974) was published mostly in Lithuanian physics
journals and was not read by many in the western mathematical community.
Hoefsmit ([H] 1974), unknowingly, had analogues of these elements in the
Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type B but his thesis was never published and these
elements remained largely unknown. Only, when the work of Murphy ([M1-
2] 1981, 1983) appeared did these elements begin to receive wider attention.
Somehow though, the mechanism of seminormal representations and Jucys-
Murphy elements still seemed complex and specic to the symmetric group.
     After this, people began to try to generalize this picture to other types.
Cherednik [Ch] gave analogues of the Jucys-Murphy elements for the Weyl
groups of types B and D, but his paper was read by almost noone in the
seminormal representations camp since his paper was written from the point
of view of constructing monodromy representations. In the period 1985-1995,
Dipper, James, and Murphy ([DJ1-3] 1986, 1987, 1992, [M1],[M4] 1992, 1995,
[DJM] 1995)) have done a lot of work on representations of Iwahori-Hecke
algebras and have produced analogues of the Jucys-Murphy elements for
Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types A and B. Their version of these elements in
type A was written in such a way that it was not clear to anybody that they
were the same as the elements that were in Hoefsmit's thesis!
History
     Alfred Young [Y] wrote down several ways of producing irreducible rep-
resentations and minimal idempotents in the group algebra of the symmetric
group. This material seems to have been challenging to read from the be-
ginning and it is my impression that today there only a few experts on what
Young actually wrote. More recent updates of the theory of Young are given
in the books by Rutherford [Ru] and James and Kerber [JK].
     Although I have not read Young's work myself, it is generally accepted
4                                                               Arun Ram
that Young extended most parts of his work on the symmetric group to
the cases of the Weyl groups of types B and D. Other treatments of the
representation theory of these groups is in the literature but is sparse and
scattered.
     In the late 1960's, Jucys [Ju], and later in the early 1980's, Murphy
[Mu] inserted a new and beautiful feature in this theory by writing down
elements in the group algebra of the symmetric group, which, in Young's
irreducible seminormal representations of the symmetric group, are always
diagonal matrices. Even better, the diagonal entries of these matrices have
an easy combinatorial description. They showed that Young's seminormal
representations could be reconstructed from the knowledge of these special
elements. Analogues of the Jucys-Murphy elements for Weyl groups of types
B and D seem to be rst in the work of Cherednik [Ch].
     In 1974, Hoefsmit [H] completed a fantastic Ph.D. thesis in which he
wrote down irreducible seminormal representations for the Iwahori-Hecke
algebras of types A, B, and D. In fact, Hoefsmit had, at least for the type B
case, analogues of the Jucys-Murphy elements for Iwahori-Hecke algebras.
     More recently, there have been new \Hecke algebras" which have been
discovered by Ariki [Ar], Ariki-Koike [AK], and Broue-Malle [BM], which are
similar to the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types B and D. Ariki-Koike [AK]
and Ariki [Ar] have shown that Hoefsmit's constructions can be extended
to give seminormal representations of these algebras as well. Ariki, Koike,
and Broue and Malle have given essentially the same analogues of the Jucys-
Murphy elements as Hoefsmit had.
Acknowledgements
     I would like to thank especially Curtis Greene and Persi Diaconis for
asking me questions, many helpful conversations and their encouragement of
this work. R. Stanley and P. Diaconis tried to get me interested in analogues
of Jucys-Murphy elements in Iwahori-Hecke algebras in 1992 and 1993. They
had asked me at that time whether I knew analogues of these in any other
cases outside of Iwahori-Hecke algebras of Type A and the symmetric group.
I only really got excited about Jucys-Murphy elements after Curtis Greene
explained the story to me in summer 1994. At that time it still seemed to
us that analogues of these elements were unknown for Weyl groups of types
B and D.
     I would like to thank Rob Leduc for pushing and wanting to nd explicit
representations of the Brauer and Birman-Wenzl algebras in early 1994. It
was while we were doing this work [LR] that we rst saw analogues of Jucys-
Murphy elements coming out of quantum groups. I would like to thank

              1. What is a seminormal representation?
    For convenience and simplicity we shall work over the eld C of complex
numbers. Let f1g = G0  G1      Gn = G be a chain of nite groups.
Let V  be an irreducible module for G. Upon restriction to the group Gn 1
the module V  decomposes as a direct sum
                             V 
                                = V       V k
                                        1




of irreducible modules for Gn 1. Similarly each of these summands decom-
poses into irreducible on restriction to Gn 2, and so on.
     A seminormal basis of V  is a basis B = fvL g of V  that explicitly
realizes these decompositions, i.e. there is a partition of B into subsets
B ; : : : ; Bk such that if V i = C -span(Bi ) then
    1




                             V  = V       V k
                                        1




as Gn 1 modules (note that here there is an = sign rather than only         =).
Further, we require that each of the subsets Bi partitions into subsets which
realize the decomposition upon restricting to Gn 2, and so on all the way
down the chain. Thus, to specify a seminormal basis one must give, not only
the basis of V  but also the series of partitions. The resulting representation
                     : G ! Md (C );           d = dim(V );
of G which is specied by V  and the basis B is a seminormal representation
of G with respect to the chain G0      Gn = G.
       The concepts of seminormal bases and seminormal representations apply
equally well to any chain of split semisimple algebras C   = H0  H1 
   Hn = H .

    Let G^ i be an index set for the irreducible representations of Gi. Dene

In other words, upon restriction from Gi to Gi 1 the irreducible module V  ,
 2 G^ i 1 , appears in the irreducible Gi -module V ,  2 G^ i , with multiplicity

where Md(C ) denotes the algebra of d  d matrices with entries from C and
d = Card(L()). For each  2 G^ m dene an Pm -module by dening
              V  = C -spanfvL j L 2 L()g and EST vL = TLvS ;            (1:3)
for all paths S; T; L 2 L(). The Am -modules V ,  2 G^ m , realize all of the

       Given a path T = ( !    ! ) from  to  and a path S = ( !

Let  2 G^ m and let V  be the irreducible representation of Pm corresponding

for all 0  i  n. Given such an isomorphism, irreducible seminormal
representations are given by the modules V  in (1.3) where the action of an

Proof. By Schur's lemma any central element zk;j 2 C Gk must act by a scalar
multiple of the identity in every irreducible representation of Gk . Specically,
zk;j acts by the scalar ck;j () in the irreducible Gk -module indexed by .
Each of the basis vectors vL , L = ((0) !    ! (n)) is in an irreducible
Pk -module which is isomorphic to the irreducible Pk -module V ( k ) indexed

The following proposition shows that in many cases the isomorphism  in
(1.6) can be determined more or less explicitly.
Proposition 1.12. The choice of an isomorphism  as in (1.6) is deter-
mined by the choice of elements
                               (EML ) = eML 2 C G
for each pair of paths L; M in . Assume that each path in is distinguished
by its weight, i.e., if L and M are paths in and L 6= M , then wt(L) 6=
wt(M ).
      (a) For each path L in the element eLL is determined uniquely by the
          elements zk;j 2 Zk and the constants ck;j (),  2 G^ k , 0  k  n.
      (b) If M and L are paths in such that M 6= L then eML is determined
          up to a constant by the elements zk;j 2 Zk and the constants ck;j (),
           2 G^ k , 0  k  n.
Proof. Let L = ((0; : : : ; (n)) be a path in . For each 0  k  n and each
1  j  rk , let
                                       Y                zk;j ck;j ()
               pk;j ((k)) =
                               ck;j ()6=ck;j ( k ) ck;j ( ) ck;j ()
                                                            (k )
                                               ( )




where the product is over all ck;j (),  2 G^ k such that ck;j () 6= ck;j ((k)).
There may be elements  2 G^ k such that  6= (k) but such that ck;j () =
ck;j ((k)). These  2 G^k are not included in the product. It follows from
Lemma (1.9) that if M = ((0) !    ! (n)) is a path in then, for any
isomorphism  as in (1.6),
                                   
             (pk;j ( k ))vM =
                      ( )              vM ; if ck;j ((k)) = ck;j ((k)),
                                       0; otherwise.

If M = ((0) !    ! (n)) is a path in then
                      (eLL )vM = LM vM = ELL vM ;
since, if L 6= M then wt(L) 6= wt(M ). The result follows since  is injective.
     (b) Assume that M and L are paths in such that M 6= L. Let
a 2 C G such that eMM aeLL 6= 0. Then eML must be a constant times the
element eMM aeLL 2 C G. Since the elements eLL and eMM are completely
determined by the elements zk;j and the constants ck;j () it follows that the
elements eML are determined (up to a constant) by them.

Remark 1.13. Suppose that
          :   Pn ! C G          and      0 : Pn ! C G
              EML 7! eML                       EML 7! e0ML
are two isomorphisms between the path algebra Pn and C G. Let ML 2 C
be such that eML = MLe0ML . The constants ML must satisfy the relations
                MLLM = 1;        and      ML LN = MN ;
for all choices of paths M; L; N 2 L. These relations follow from the relations
eML ePS = LP eMS in (1.2).
Example 1.14. Suppose that f1g = G0      Gn = G is a chain of
nite groups such that, for each 1  i  n, the restriction rules describing
the decomposition of irreducible Gi -representations into irreducible Gi 1-
representations are multiplicity free. For each 1  i  n, let Zi be the set of
sums of elements in each conjugacy class of Gi. Clearly Zi is a set of central
elements in C Gi . This is an example of a situation in which the paths in the
graph are distinguished by their weights.

are all multiplicity free. Thus, the Weyl groups Sn, WBn, WF4 , WE6,
WE7, all fall into the situation of example (1.14) and one can use the sets Zk
consisting of all conjugacy class sums and Proposition (1.12) to compute all
the irreducible representations of these Weyl groups and their corresponding
Iwahori-Hecke algebras (In the WE7  WE8 case the branching rule has
multiplicities  2 and could be treated in a similar fashion to Example 1.14
except that one would have to also use some additional elements from the
centralizer of the WE7 action on irreducible WE8 representations.) We
shall show in the remainder of this paper that one can use much smaller sets
for the Zk and obtain the same results in a quicker way. We shall obtain
\seminormal" representations of the Weyl groups and Iwahori-Hecke algebras
of type Dn by using the representation theory for type Bn, see section 5.
Weyl groups
   Let ; = R0      Rn = R be a chain of root systems and let
                              f1g = W      Wn
                                           0


be the corresponding chain of Weyl groups. Let R+k denote the set of positive
roots in the root system Rk and, for each  2 R+k let s denote the element
of Wk which is the reection in the hyperplane perpendicular to .
  (2.1a) If all roots in Rk are the same length then the set of elements
          fs j  2 R+k g, is a conjugacy class in Wk . It follows that
                                                    X
                                           zk;` =           s
                                                    2R+k

         is a central element of C Wk . (The index ` here simply denotes that
         this is a sum over the \long" roots in R+k .)
  (2.1b) If the roots in Rk are not all the same length then there are two
         lengths of roots. Let R+k;s be the set of short positive roots and let
         R+k;` be the set of long positive roots in Rk . The sets fs j  2 R+k;sg
         and fs j  2 R+k;`g are conjugacy classes in W and the elements
                               X                                       X
                     zk;s =             s ;    and          zk;` =             s ;
                              2R+k;s                                 2R+k;`

         are central elements in C Wk .
Seminormal representations                                                  13
  (2.1c) If the longest element wk;0 in the Weyl group Wk acts as 1 in the
         reection representation of Wk then the element
                                          zk;0 = wk;0
         is central in Wk .
For each 0  k  n, let Zk denote the set of central elements in C Wk
which are determined by (2.1). Depending on which cases apply, the set Zk
contains either 1, 2, or 3 elements. In view of Lemma (1.9), we dene, for
each irreducible character  of the Weyl group Wk and each zk;j 2 Zk , a
constant
                              ck;j () = (z(1)
                                              k;j ) :                (2:2)
We shall use the central elements in the sets Zk (with some slight modication
in the Dn case) to compute seminormal representations for the Weyl groups
of types An 1 , Bn, Dn, G2.
Remark 2.3. In my view, the central elements in (2.1) are the appropri-
ate generalization of Jucys-Murphy elements to arbitrary Weyl groups (or
Coxeter groups). Remarks (3.5) and (4.6) illustrate this idea in special cases.

Iwahori-Hecke algebras
     Let  be a Dynkin diagram of a nite Weyl group, let R be the cor-
responding root system, and let W be the corresponding Weyl group. Let
fi j i 2 g be the set of simple roots in R, indexed by the nodes in the
Dynkin diagram . The Iwahori-Hecke algebra H (p2 ; q2 ) corresponding to
the Weyl group W is the algebra over C (p; q ) generated by elements Ti ,
i 2 , and relations
     (a) Ti Tj Ti Tj    = Tj TiTj Ti   ;
         | {z } | {z }
          mij   factors   mij   factors

          where mij is the order of the element si sj in the Weyl group W ,
                 (p p 1 )T + 1; if  is a short root,
      (b) Ti = (q q 1)T i + 1; if i is a long root.

                            i           i
If all roots in R are the same length then we make the convention, for the
purposes of the denition of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra, that all roots in R
are long and we simply dene the Iwahori-Hecke algebra as an algebra H (q2 )
over C (q).
14                                                               Arun Ram
    It is a standard fact ([Bou] Chap. IV x2 Ex. 23-24 or [CR]) that the
Iwahori-Hecke algebra H (q2 ) corresponding to a Weyl group W is split-
semisimple and its irreducible representations can be indexed by the same set
W^ that indexes the irreducible representations of W . Following the standard
notation, if w 2 W then Tw = Ti    Tip where w = si    sip is a reduced
expression for w 2 W . The element Tw 2 H is well dened and does not
                                           1                 1



depend on the choice of the reduced expression for w.
     Let ; = 0  1      n =  be a chain of Dynkin diagrams
of nite Weyl groups. These Dynkin diagrams correspond to a chain of
root systems R0  R1      Rn = R and to a chain of Weyl groups
W0  W1      Wn = W such that, for each 1  i  n, the group Wi 1 is
a parabolic subgroup of Wi . Let

be the corresponding chain of Iwahori-Hecke algebras.
Proposition 2.4. Let Hk be the Iwahori-Hecke algebra corresponding to
a nite Weyl group Wk . Let wk;0 denote the longest element in the Weyl
group Wk .
    (a) The element Tw2k; is central in Hk (p2 ; q2). If  is an irreducible
                           0
representation of Hk (p2 ; q2) corresponding to the irreducible character  of
the Weyl group Wk , then
                       (Tw2k; ) = p2ck;s ()q2ck;` ()Id;
                                   0


where ck;s() and ck;`() are the constants given in (2.2).
     (b) If wk;0 = 1 in the reection representation of Wk , then Twk;       0
is a central element in Hk (p2 ; q2). If  is an irreducible representation of
Hk (p2 ; q2) corresponding to the irreducible character  of the Weyl group
Wk , then
                      (Twk; ) = ck;0()pck;s ()qck;` ()Id;
                              0


where ck;s(), ck;`(), and ck;0() are the constants given in (2.2).
Proof. (a) By a theorem of Breiskorn-Saito [BS] and Deligne [De], the el-
ement Tw2k; is central in the generalized braid group. Thus Tw2k; is cen-
             0                                                       0
tral in Hk (p2 ; q2) and it follows that Tw2k; acts by a constant in every ir-
reducible representation. The constant is computed by writing Twk; as a
                                                   0

                                                                         0
product of generators and taking the determinant of both sides of the equa-
tion Tw2k; = (Ti    TiN )2 = pc qc Id. It remains only to note that the
         0       1

number of short (resp. long) roots in Rk is the same as the number of fac-
tors Tij in the product Twk; = Ti    TiN such that ij is a short (resp.
                             0       1
long) root in Rk .
     (b) The result of Brieskorn-Saito and Deligne says that Twk; is central in
                                                                  0
the braid group when wk;0 = 1 in the reection representation of the Weyl
group Wk . It follows that Twk; is central in Hk (p2 ; q2). The eigenvalues
                                 0
of Twk; must be square roots of the eigenvalues of Tw2k; and they must
       0
specialize to the eigenvalues of wk;0 when p = q = 1. The result now follows
                                                            0


from (a), (2.1)(c), and the denition of the constant ck;0().


Remark 2.5. The above proposition is somewhat folklore in the subject of
Iwahori-Hecke algebras. The argument given here appears in Propositions
26 and 27 of Kilmoyer's thesis [Ki] and also appears in complete detail in the
recent paper of Geck and Michel [GM].
     Let wk;0 be the longest element in the Weyl group Wk and dene Zk =
fzk g where

  zk = Twk; ;
            0     if wk;0 = 1 in the reection representation of Wi , and
  zk = Tw2k; ;
            0
                  otherwise.
                                                                       (2:6)
We shall use these central elements (with some slight modication in the Dn
case) to compute seminormal representations for the Iwahori-Hecke algebras
of types An 1 , Bn, Dn, G2. The cases F4, E6 and E7 will be treated in a
future work.
Remark 2.7. In my view, the central elements in Proposition (2.4) are
the analogues of the Jucys-Murphy elements for the Iwahori-Hecke algebras.
Remarks (3.16) and (4.22) illustrate this idea in special cases.
    The following proposition describes concretely the connection between
the central elements of Hk (p2 ; q2 ) in Proposition (2.4) and the central ele-
ments in C Wk given in (2.1).

Proposition 2.8. If x 2 Hk (p ; q ) use the notation [x]q to denote the

Proof. Let us assume, for convenience, that all roots in Rk are the same
length. In this case we have only one indeterminate q and we are working in
the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hk (q2 ). The proof is similar in the general case.

Remark 2.9. In Proposition (2.8) we have been carefree about the process
of specializing p and q to 1. Of course this really should be done properly.
One must dene a Z-form of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hk (p2 ; q2) as an al-
gebra over A = Z[q; q 1; p; p 1 ] and only specialize, by an appropriate tensor
product Z
A Hk (p2; q2 ), elements x which are in the Z-form of Hk (p2 ; q2 ).
This is standard and it is clear that the elements (Tw2k; 1)=(q q 1) in                       0
(the proof of) Proposition (2.8) are elements in the Z-form of Hk (q2 ).

    The Weyl group of the root system An 1 is the symmetric group Sn of
permutations of f1; 2 : : : ; ng. The simple transpositions

Partitions and Standard Tableaux
     As in [Mac], we shall identify each partition  with its Ferrers diagram
and say that a box b in  is in position (i; j ) in  if b is in row i and column j
of . The rows and columns of  are labeled in the same way as for matrices.
We shall write jj = n if  is a partition with n boxes. We shall often refer
to partitions as shapes.
     A standard tableau L of shape  is a lling of the Ferrers diagram of
 with the numbers 1; 2; : : : ; n such that the numbers are increasing left to
right across the rows of L and increasing down the columns of L. For any
shape , let L() denote the set of standard tableaux of shape  and, for
each standard tableau L, let L(k) denote the box containing k in L. For
example,
                                       1   2   4
                                       3   5   6

     The chain of root systems A0  A1      An 1 corresponds to the

where Sk denotes the symmetric group of permutations of 1; 2; : : : ; k. The
irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sk are indexed by the
partitions  such that jj = k. The restriction rule from Sk to Sk 1 is given
by                             ?         M 

where the sum is over all partitions  of k 1 that are gotten from  by
removing one box. For the chain S1  S2      Sn, the graph dened
in (1.1) is the Young lattice. For n = 5, is as in Figure (3.3). A path
((0) !    ! (n)) in is naturally identied with the standard tableau
L of shape (n) which has i in the box which is added to obtain (i) from
(i 1).

of the Weyl group Sk does not act by 1 in the reection representation.
For each 1  k  n, the set Zk contains a single element zk;`, which is the
central element of C Sk given by
                                X                     X

(The ` here is spurious, as in (2.1a) it only indicates the fact that in the
root system Ak 1 all roots are long). Since the elements zk;`, 1  k  n all
commute with each other in C Sn , it follows that the elements
                                           X

Remark 3.6. The elements mk , 2  k  n, are the elements dened by
Jucys [Ju1-3] and Murphy [Mu1-3].

Weights
    The content of a box b in a shape  is given by
                ct(b) = j i;           if b is in position (i; j ) in .                 (3:7)
It follows immediately from [Mac] I x7 Ex. 7 and [Mac] I x1 Ex.3 that, for
each 1  k  n and for each partition  such that jj = k,
                                                           X
                     ck;`() =  (zk;` )= (1) =               ct(b);                  (3:8)
                                                           b2
where  denotes the character of the irreducible representation of the sym-
metric group Sk labeled by the partition . Following (1.11), the weight of
a standard tableau L = ((1) !    ! (n)), where j(k)j = k, is
                      wt(L) = c1;`((1)); : : : ; cn;`((n)) :

Note that wt(L) is completely determined by the n-tuple
                                                                           X

Proposition 3.9. Each standard tableau L = ( !    !  n ) is
                                                           (1)              ( )

determined uniquely by its weight.
Proof. Two boxes b and b0 in a partition  have the same content only if they
lie on the same diagonal. It follows easily that, if (i) is a partition, then each
of the boxes b that can be added to (i) to get a new partition has a dierent
content ct(b). Thus, the shape (i+1) in a standard tableau L is completely
determined by the previous shape (i) and the content ct(b) of the added
box b. It follows that a standard tableau L is completely determined wft(L)
and therefore by its weight wt(L).
     Proposition (1.12) and Proposition (3.9) together show that the semi-
normal representations of Sn corresponding to the chain of groups f1g =
S0      Sn are essentially determined by the elements zk;` in (3.4) and
the constants ck;`() in (3.8). It follows that we should be able to determine
seminormal representations of the group Sn from the elements mk and the
constants ct(b). This is done in Theorems (3.12) and (3.14) below.
Seminormal representations
     Let P1  P2      Pn be the path algebras, dened in (1.2), which
are associated to the diagram which describes the restriction rules for the
chain S1      Sn. For each partition  of size n, let
                        V  = C -spanfvL j L 2 L()g;                       (3:10)
so that the vectors vL , indexed by standard tableaux L of shape , form a
seminormal basis of the Pn -module V . It follows from Lemma (1.9), that
for any choice of an isomorphism  between the path algebra Pn and C Sn
such that (Pk ) = C Sk  C Sn for all 1  k  n, we have that
                             zk;`vL = ck;`((k))vL ;
if L = ((1) !    ! (n)). If mk is as in (3.5), then
                              mk vL = ct(L(k))vL ;
for a standard tableau L = ((1) !    ! (n)).
     For each 2  k  n and each standard tableau L of size n, dene
                     (sk )LL = ct(L(k)) 1ct(L(k 1))                  (3:11)

     In the interests of space we shall not give the proof of the following
theorems here. The proofs are essentially the same as the proofs which are
given for Theorem (4.15) and Theorem (4.18).
Theorem 3.12. (Young [Y]) Let  be a partition such that jj = n.
Dene an action of each generator s2 ; : : : ; sn of the symmetric group Sn on
V  by dening
            si vL = (si )LL vL + (1 + (si )LL )vsi L; 2  i  n;         (3:13)
where si L is the same standard tableau as L except that the positions of i
and i 1 are switched in si L. If si L is not standard, then we dene vsi L = 0.
This action extends to a well dened action of Sn on V  .
Theorem 3.14. (Young [Y]) The Sn modules V  dened in Theorem
(3.12), where  runs over all partitions such that jj = n, form a complete
set of nonisomorphic irreducible modules for the symmetric group Sn and,
for each , the basis fvL j L 2 L()g is a seminormal basis of the Sn-module
V .

In type Ak 1 the longest element wk;0 of the group Sk does not act by 1
in the reection representation. Following (2.4), we dene sets Zk = fzk g,
2  k  n, where zk is the central element of HAk 1 (q2) given by
                       zk = Tw2k; = Mk Mk 1    M2 :

Since the elements zk , 2  k  n, all commute in HAn 1 (q2 ) it follows that
the elements Mk , 2  k  n all commute with each other.
Remark 3.17. Using the relation Ti2 = (q q 1 )Ti +1, an easy computation
shows that
                            Mk 1 = X    k
                                          T(i 1;k);                    (3:18)

elements used by Dipper, James, and Murphy in their work on Iwahori-
Hecke algebras of type A, see [DJ1-2], [M1], [M4]. It is clear that (3.18)
gives a q-analogue of the Jucys-Murphy elements in (3.5).

     The Weyl group WBn of type Bn is the group of signed permuta-
tions of 1; 2; : : : ; n. More specically, WBn consists of all permutations
 of f n; : : : ; 1; 1; : : : ; ng such that ( k) = (k) for all 1  k 
n. We represent elements of WBn in cycle notation as permutations of
f n; : : : ; 1; 1; : : : ; ng. The elements
     s1 = (1; 1);      and        si = (i 1; i)( (i 1); i); 2  i  n;
generate WBn and satisfy the relations
                       si sj = sj si; ji j j > 1;
                   sisi+1 si = si+1 sisi+1 ; 2  i  n 1;

Double Partitions and Standard Tableaux
     A double partition of size n,  = (;  ), is an ordered pair of partitions
 and  such that jj + j j = n. We shall often refer to double partitions as
shapes. A standard tableau L = (L ; L ) of shape  = (;  ) is a lling of the
Ferrers diagram of  with the numbers 1; 2; : : : ; n such that the numbers are
increasing left to right across the rows of L and L and increasing down the
columns of L and L . For any shape , let L() denote the set of standard
tableaux of shape  and, for each standard tableau L, let L(k) denote the
box containing k in L. For example,
                                              2   3   4

      The irreducible representations of the symmetric group WBk are in-
dexed by double partitions  = (;  ) such that jj = jj + j j = k. The

where the sum is over all double partitions (;  ) of size k 1 that are gotten
from (;  ) by removing one box. If we dene the graph as in (1.1) for the
chain in (4.3), then a path ((0) !    ! (n)) in is naturally identied
with the standard tableau L of shape (n) which has i in the box which
is added to obtain (i) from (i 1). The graph for the case of the chain

elements in C WBk given in (4.5). Let (;  ) be a double partition such that

Proof. Fix k and a double partition (;  ) such that jj + j j = k. Let a = jj
and b = j j. Let WBa be the subgroup of WBk of signed permutations of
f1; 2; : : : ; ag and let WBb be the subgroup of WBk of signed permutations
28                                                                     Arun Ram
of fa + 1; : : : ; kg. Let Sa and Sb be the symmetric groups of permutations
of f1; : : : ; ag and fa + 1; : : : ; kg respectively.
      Let V  be the irreducible module for the symmetric group Sa which is
labeled by the partition . Extend this module to the group WBa by letting
the signs, i.e. the element (1; 1) act trivially. Let V  be the irreducible
module for the symmetric group Sb which is labeled by  . Extend this
module to group WBb by letting the element (a + 1; (a + 1)) act by 1 on
V  . Then V  and V  are irreducible modules for the groups WBa and WBb
respectively, they are the modules that are ordinarily denoted by V (;;) and
V (;;) respectively. It follows from this construction of V (;;) and V (;;) that

     (;;)((1; 2)) =  ((1; 2));
     (;;)((1; 1)) = (1);

     (;;)((a + 1; (a + 1)(a + 2; (a + 2))    (k; k)) = ( 1)b (1));

where  and  denote the irreducible characters of the symmetric groups
Sa and Sb labeled by  and  , respectively.

tion (;  ). (I believe that this fact is originally due to Specht [Spe].) Given
this realization we can write down its character (;) explicitly by using the
standard formula for induced characters.

Proposition 4.11. Each standard tableau L = ( !    !  n ) is (1)         ( )

determined uniquely by its weight.
Proof. Suppose that the weight wt(L) of a standard tableau L is given but
that we don't know L. The vector wt(L) uniquely determines the vectors
wft1 (L) and wft2 (L). We want to show that the tableau L can be reconstructed
from wft1(L) and wft2(L). Assume that we have reconstructed L up to the
ith step, i.e., assume that we know (0); : : : ; (i), but that we don't yet know
(i+1). Suppose that (i) is the double partition ((i);  (i)).
      We need to gure out from wft1(L) and wft2 (L) where to add the box
to get (i+1) = ((i+1);  (i+1)). The entry sgn(L(i + 1)) in wft2(L) tells us
whether we must add the box to the partition (i) or to the partition  (i). As
in the proof of Proposition (3.9), the entry ct(L(i +1)) from wft1 (L) indicates
the position where this box must be added. It follows that (i+1) is uniquely
determined. Thus L is completely determined by wt(L).
     Proposition (1.12) and Proposition (4.11) together show that the semi-
normal representations of WBn corresponding to the chain of groups f1g =
WB0      WBn are essentially determined by the elements zk;j in (4.5)
and the constants ck;j () in Proposition (4.8). It follows that we should be
able to determine seminormal representations of the group WBn from the

so that the vectors vL , indexed by standard tableaux L of shape (;  ), form

forced by the formulas in (4.13). We shall prove this for i = n. The proof
for i < n is similar. Note that the formula for the action of s1 follows
immediately from the formula for the action of m1;s in (4.13).

If M = ((0) !    ! (n)) is another standard tableau of shape (;  ) then

                          ; otherwise.
Note that since (n 2) and (n) = (;  ) only dier by two boxes there are
only two tableaux M such that (k) = (k) for all 1  k  n 2. These two
tableaux are snL and L itself. It follows that
                                v ;           if M = snL or M = L,
                pL[n   2]   vM = M   0;        otherwise.
    Since each of the elements zk;s, zk;`, zk;0 appearing the product (*) is an
element of WBn 2 it follows that pL[n 2] commutes with sn in WBn. Thus
      (sn )LL vL + (sn )snL;L vsn L = pL[n 2] sn vL = snpL[n 2] vL = snvL :
It follows that (sn )ML = 0 unless M = snL or M = L.
Step 2. A direct computation shows that
                    sn mn     1 ;` = mn;` sn          1 mn;smn 1;s:
Let both sides act on vL and take the coecient of vL in the result. Then,
using (4.13), we have
     (sn )LL ct(L(n 1)) = ct(L(n))(sn )LL 1 sgn(L(n))sgn(L(n 1)):
It follows that (sn )LL is as given in (4.14).

Step 3. Consider the equation s2n = 1. Let both sides act on vL and take the
coecient of vL in the result. We get the equation (sn )2LL +(sn )LM (sn)ML =
1; where M = snL. It follows that
                 (sn )LM (sn )ML = (1 + (sn )LL )(1 (sn )LL ):        (4:17)
By Proposition (1.12)(b), the values of (sn)LM and (sn )ML are determined
only up to a constant and we may choose them to be anything such that the
equation in (4.17) holds. Note that this is consistent with the denition of
the action in the statement of the theorem since 1 (sn)sn L;snL = 1+(sn)LL .


Theorem 4.18. (Young [Y]) The WBn modules V                          (; ) dened in The-
orem (4.15), where (;  ) runs over all ordered pairs of partitions such that

the Weyl group WBn and, for each (;  ), the basis fvL j L 2 L(;  )g is a
seminormal basis of the WBn-module V (;).
Proof. This now follows immediately by induction on n. Indeed, V (;) is
the unique WBn-module such that

The longest element wk;0 in the Weyl group WBk acts by 1 in the reection

Since the elements zk , 1  k  n, all commute in HBn(p2 ; q2) it follows that
the elements Mk , 1  k  n all commute with each other.
Remark 4.22. The elements Mk appear in Hoefsmit [H] Proposition 3.3.3
and also in work of Ariki-Koike [AK], Ariki [Ar], Broue-Malle [BM], and
Dipper-James [DJ3]. These elements can be viewed as the quantized versions
of the elements in (4.13).

Seminormal representations
     Let P1  P2      Pn be the path algebras (over C (p; q) instead of C ),
dened in (1.2), which are associated to the diagram which describes the
restriction rules for the chain WB1      WBn. For each double partition

so that the vectors vL , indexed by standard tableaux L of shape (;  ),
form a seminormal basis of the Pn-module V (;). It follows from Lemma

Theorem 4.26. Let (;  ) be a double partition such that jj + j;j = n.

where si L is the same standard tableau as L except that the positions of i

This action extends to a well dened action of HBn(p2 ; q2 ) on V (;).
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem (4.15), in all essential
aspects. We shall only give the details for step 2.
Step 2. It is immediate from the denition of Mk in (4.20) that Mn =
TnMn 1 Tn, which can be rewritten as
                             Tn 1 = Mn 1 Tn Mn 1:
Rewrite Tn 1 as Tn (q q 1 ), let both sides act on vL and take the coecient
of vL in the result. Using (4.24), we get
           (Tn)LL (q q 1 ) = CT(L(n)) 1 (Tn )LL CT(L(n 1)):
It follows that (Tn )LL is as given in (4.25).
     As in the case of Weyl group WBn, Theorem (4.18), the following result
follows easily.

The Weyl group
     The Weyl group WDn of type Dn is the group of signed permutations of
f1; 2; : : : ; ng with an even number of signs. More specically, WDn consists
of all permutations  of f n; : : : ; 1; 1; : : : ; ng such that ( k) = (k) for
all 1  k  n, and an even number of the elements of f(1); (2); : : : ; (n)g
are negative. We represent elements of WDn in cycle notation as permuta-
tions of f n; : : : ; 1; 1; : : : ; ng.
     The elements
 s~1 = (1; 2)(2; 1);         and    s~i = (i 1; i)( (i 1); i); 2  i  n;
generate WDn and satisfy the relations
                    s~i s~j = s~j s~i ; ji j j > 1; and i; j > 1;
                   s~1s~j = s~j s~1; if j 6= 3;

where si , 1  i  n, are as in (4.1).
Double Partitions and Standard Tableaux
    We shall use the same notations for partitions, double partitions, shapes,
and tableaux as in section 4. For each standard tableau L = (L; L ) of
shape (;  ) dene L to be the standard tableau of shape (; ) given by
L = (L ; L),
                       : L(;  ) ! L(; )                             (5:3)
                           (L ; L ) 7! (L ; L):
The map  is an involution on the set of standard tableaux whose shape is
a double partition.
Which chain?

     One nds that it is more natural to use the representation theory of the
Weyl groups WBn and the fact that WDn is a normal subgroup of index 2
in WBn rather than to try to choose an appropriate chain of root systems
leading up to Dn . The reason for this is that one wants to have an approach
that treats all of the groups WDn, n  4, uniformly. Otherwise one must
distinguish the cases when n is even and when n is odd. In the end we shall
nd a set of commuting elements in the group algebra of WDn , analogues of
the Jucys-Murphy elements, which determine a complete set of irreducible
representations.
Representations
      We shall retain the notations from section 4 for the sign and the content
of a box in a double partition. Let  = (;  ) be a double partition such
that jj + j j = n. As in (4.12), let
                          V (;) = C -spanfvL j L 2 L(;  )g              (5:4)
so that the vectors vL form a basis of the vector space V (;) indexed by
standard tableaux L of shape (;  ).
      For each standard tableau L, dene
          (sk )LL = 1 +ct(sgn( L(k))sgn(L(k 1)) ; for 2  k  n,            (5:5)
                           L(k)) ct(L(k 1))
as in (4.14). Recall, Theorem (4.15), that there is an action of WBn on the
vector space V (;). Restricting this action to WDn gives
     s~1 vL = s1 s2 s1vL = (s2 )LL vL (1 + (s2 )LL )vs L;
                                                     2
                                                                            (5:6)
            s~i vL = si vL = (si )LL vL + (1 + (si )LL )vsi L ; 2  i  n;
for each L 2 L(;  ), where, as in the case of type Bn, we dene vsi L = 0 if
si L is not standard. In deriving the rst formula of (5.6) it is helpful to note
that sgn(L(1)) = 1, and sgn(s2 L(1)) = sgn(L(1)) if s2 L is standard.
      Now suppose n is even, and let  be a partition such that 2jj = n.

Theorem 5.9. (Young [Y]) The modules V           ; ), where (;  ) runs over all
                                                 (

unordered pairs of partitions such that  6=  and jj + j j = n and, when n
is even, the modules V (;) and V (;) , where  runs over all partitions
                            +


such that 2jj = n, form a complete set of nonisomorphic irreducible modules
for WDn .
Remark 5.10. The involution  on standard tableaux in (5.3) is a realization
of the module isomorphism between the WDn-modules V (;) and V (;),
which, in turn, comes from the automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of type
Dn.
     Instead of dening V (;) as in (5.7), let us dene them as the quotient
spaces
                        (;)                            (;)
        V (;) = hv V = v i and V (;) = hv V= v i ;
              +
                                                                         (5:11)
                     L      L                         L      L
where  is the involution given in (5.3) and hvL = vL i and hvL = vL i
denote the subspaces spanned the the vectors vL vL and by vL + vL
respectively. Clearly the two denitions   of the modules V (;) are equiva-
                             (;)
lent, the rst represents V         as subspaces of V (;), and the second as
quotient spaces of V (;). The only dierence is that for some computations
the quotient module approach is easier, one may compute the action as in
the formulas in (5.6) and then apply the relations vL = vL .

where sgn and ct are as given in (4.7).
Lemma 5.13. If L is a standard tableau then there is0 only one other
standard tableau L0 such that wft (L0 ) = wft (L) and wft (L0 ) = wft0 (L).
                                      1            1
This standard tableau is L0 = L; where  is the involution dened in (5.3).

Proof. Let wft1 and wft2 be as dened in Proposition (4.11). It follows from
Proposition (4.11) that wft1 (L) and wft2(L) uniquely determine L. Since
wft02(L) is always either +1 or 1 times every entry in the sequence wft2(L)
it follows that there can be at most two standard
                                            0      tableaux

the same weights wft1(L ) = wft1(L) and wft2(L ) = wft2 (L). On the other

hand it is immediate that one always has that wft02(L) = wft02(L) since
sgn(L(k)) = sgn(L(k)) for all k.

       Let q be an indeterminate. The Iwahori-Hecke algebra HDn (q2 ) of type
Dn is the associative algebra with 1 over the eld C (q ) given by generators
T~1; T~2 ; : : : ; T~n and relations
                                T~iT~j = T~j T~i ; ji j j > 1; i; j > 1;

Let HBn (1; q2) be the algebra over C (q) dened by generators T1; : : : ; Tn
and relations as in (4.19) except with p = 1. Dene
             T~1 = T1T2 T1; and T~i = Ti ; 2  i  n:                (5:15)
Then one checks that with these denitions the T~i satisfy the relations in
(5.14). The elements T~i , 1  i  n, generate a subalgebra of the algebra
HBn(1; q2 ) which is isomorphic to the algebra HDn (q2 ).
Representations
     One derives the representation theory of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra HDn (q2 )
using the results from section 4 and the fact that HDn (q2 ) is a subalgebra of
the Iwahori-Hecke algebra HBn(1; q2 ). The procedure is exactly as for the
case (5.4-5.9) of the Weyl groups WDn  WBn.
     Let V (;) be as in (4.23). As in (4.25), for 2  k  n and each standard
tableau L, dene
 (T~k )LL = (Tk )LL =         q q    1

for a box b in a shape  = (;  ). Restricting the action (4.27) of HBn (1; q2 )
to HDn (q2) gives
   T~s vL = Ts Ts Ts vL = (T~s )LL vL (q 1 + (T~s )LL )vs L ;

for each L 2 L(;  ), where, as in the case of type Bn, we dene vsi L = 0
if si L is not standard. In deriving the rst formula of (5.17) it is helpful to
note that CT (L(1)) = 1, and CT (s2 L(1)) = CT (L(1)) if s2 L is standard.

G2 -analogues of the Jucys-Murphy elements in (3.5).

Proposition 6.4. Each path L = ( !  !  ) in is distinguished

Proof. This follows easily by a direct check.
    Proposition (1.12) and Proposition (6.4) together show that the semi-
normal representations of WG2 corresponding to the chain of groups f1g 
S2  WG2 are essentially determined by the elements zk;j in (6.2) and the
constants ck;j () which appear in (6.3). These representations are given in
Theorem (6.7) below.
Seminormal representations
     Let P1  P2 be the path algebras, dened in section 1, which are asso-
ciated to the diagram in (6.1). For each  2 G^ 2, let
                       V  = C -spanfvL j L 2 L()g;                     (6:5)
so that the vectors vL , indexed by the paths L = ( ! (1) ! (2) = ) in
which end at , form a seminormal basis of the irreducible P2-module V . It
follows from Lemma (1.9), that for any choice of an isomorphism  between
the path algebra P2 and the C WG2 such that (P1 ) = C S2  C WG2 ,

Proof. For any two paths M and L in the graph which end at the same label
. Let (sk )ML denote the coecient of vM in sk vL . The constant (sk )ML is
a matrix entry in the matrix for sk in the irreducible representation labeled
by . It follows from Proposition (1.12)(a) and Proposition (6.4) that the
diagonal entries of these matrices must be determined by the equations in
(6.6) and that the o diagonal entries are determined up to a constant.
     The matrices giving the one-dimensional representations are easily got-
ten from the relations in (6.6). Let us explain how one derives the matrices
for the two dimensional case.
(a) The matrices for s1 are determined by (6.6).
(b) From the denitions (6.2), one gets easily that z2;` = s2 + z1;`s2 z1;` +
z2;0z1;`: Let both sides of this equation act on vL and take the coecient of
vL to get, via (6.6), the equation
     c2;`((2)) = (s2 )LL + c1;`((1))(s2 )LL c1;`((1)) + c2;0((2))c1;`((1)):
It follows that
                    (s2 )LL = c2;`( 1) + cc2;0(((1)))c21;0( ) :
                                     (2)           (2)         (1)

                                            1;0

All of the diagonal entries in the matrices for s2 are determined by this
formula and the values in (6.3).
(c) Let both sides of the equation s22 = 1 act on the vector vL and take the
coecient of vL in the result. One gets the equation
                           (s2 )LM (s2 )ML + (s2 )2LL = 1;
where M is the path to  in which is not L. It follows that
                   (s2 )LM (s2 )ML = (1 + (s2 )LL )(1 (s2 )LL ):
Because of the freedom in the choice of the o diagonal entries, Proposition
(1.12)(b), it follows that we may choose (s2 )ML = 1 + (s2 )LL = 1 (s2 )MM .

        d = (q q 1 ) a;                         w = (q q 1 ) x:
Proof. The proof is entirely similar to the proof of Theorem (6.7). Let us
only explain how to get the entries in the matrices 2;1(T2 ) and 2;2(T2 ).
Let  = (2; 1) or  = (2; 2) and suppose that L and M are the two paths to
 in . From the denition of the element z2 we get
                            T1 1T2 1 T1 1z2 = T2 T1T2:
By rewriting T2 1 as T2 (q q 1 ) we have
                   T1 1 T2T1 1 z2 (q q 1 )T1 2 z2 = T2T1 T2:
Taking the (L; M ) entry of each side of the above equation gives
 (T1)LL1 (T2 )LM (T1)MM1
                          c2;0() 0
                           = (T2 )LL (T1)LL (T2 )LM + (T2)LM (T1 )MM (T2 )MM :
Seminormal representations                                                49
Since these representations are irreducible it follows that (T2 )LM 6= 0. Di-
viding by (T2 )LM and using the fact that (T1)LL = p and (T1 )MM = p 1,
we get the equation
                      c2;0() = p(T2 )LL p 1(T2 )MM :                     (i)
Now, the equation T22 = (q q 1 )T2 + 1 forces that the trace of the matrix
of T2 is q q 1, and so
                       (T2 )LL + (T2 )MM = q q 1 :                       (ii)
The values for x and a in the statement of the theorem now follow easily
from (i) and (ii). The values of the o diagonal entries are determined (up
to a constant, see Proposition (1.12)(a)) by the equation
              (T2 )LM (T2 )ML = (q 1 + (T2)LL )(q (T2)MM ):
This equation is obtained by taking the (L; L) entry in the equation T22 =
(q q 1 )T2 + 1.
