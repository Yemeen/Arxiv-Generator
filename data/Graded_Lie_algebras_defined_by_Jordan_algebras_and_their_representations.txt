                                                     Abstract. In this talk we introduce the notion of a generalized representation
                                                     of a Jordan algebra with unit which has the following properties:
                                                         1) Usual representations and Jacobson representations correspond to spe-
                                                     cial cases of generalized representations.
                                                         2) Every simple Jordan algebra has infinitely many nonequivalent general-
                                                     ized representations.
                                                         3) There is a one-to-one correspondence between irreducible generalized
                                                     representations of a Jordan algebra A and irreducible representations of a
                                                     graded Lie algebra L(A) = Uâˆ’1 âŠ• U0 âŠ• U1 corresponding to A (the Lie algebra
                                                     L(A) coincides with the TKK construction when A has a unit).
                                                         The latter correspondence allows to use the theory of representations of
                                                     Lie algebras to study generalized representations of Jordan algebras. In par-
                                                     ticular, one can classify irreducible generalized representations of semisimple
                                                     Jordan algebras and also obtain classical results about usual representations
                                                     and Jacobson representations in a simple way.

                                                                                   Introduction
                                                Jordan algebras were introduced by P. Jordan, J. von Neumann and E. Wigner
                                             (see [1]) in the connection with some problems of quantum mechanics. Already there
                                             it was found that simple Jordan algebras have only a finite number of nonequivalent
                                             irreducible representations (homomorphisms into a space of linear operators with
                                             operation X âˆ— Y = XY + Y X). Moreover (A. Albert [2]), the exceptional Jordan
                                             algebra E3 has no such representations at all.
                                                This situation demonstrates a big difference between Lie and Jordan algebras.
                                             (As is known a Lie algebra has infinitely many nonequivalent irreducible represen-
                                             tations.)
                                                To improve the situation, N. Jacobson introduced [3] another notion of a repre-
                                             sentation of a Jordan algebra (see below the definition of the Jacobson represen-
                                             tation) and showed that every simple Jordan algebra has at least one nontrivial
                                             Jacobson representation. But still the number of Jacobson representations is also
                                             finite.
                                                In this talk we will introduce a notion of a generalized representation of a Jordan
                                             algebra with unit and will describe the irreducible generalized representations. The
                                             irreducible generalized representations are in a one-to-one correspondence with the
                                             irreducible representations of the 3-graded Lie algebra L(A) corresponding to A.
                                                In particular, every simple Jordan algebra has infinitely many nonequivalent
                                             irreducible generalized representations.

   The usual and Jacobson representations correspond to special cases of generalized
representations. Moreover, this correspondence preserves the irreducibility and the
equivalence of representations. In particular, it allows to classify irreducible usual
and Jacobson representations.

Shestakov for useful discussions.

           Â§1 A graded Lie algebra L(A) defined by a Jordan algebra A
   We need a construction of a 3-graded Lie algebra L(A) defined by a Jordan
algebra A.
   The construction of L(A) is presented as it was originally given in [4], [5] (see
also [6]).
   This construction coincides with what is called the TKK construction when
Jordan algebras A has a unit, but does not coincide with it in general (for example
dimUâˆ’1 is not equal in general to dimU1 ). The Lie algebra L(A) has the following
two important properties:
   1) There is an element AÌ„ âˆˆ U1 such that [[AÌ„, x], y] = x âˆ— y âˆ€x, y âˆˆ Uâˆ’1 , where âˆ—
is the multiplication in the given algebra A. (The space Uâˆ’1 is identified with the
space of the algebra A.)
   2) The Lie algebra L(A) is generated by the space Uâˆ’1 and the element AÌ„ âˆˆ U1 .
   To construct the Lie algebra L(A) let us denote by U the space of the algebra A
and by AÌ„(x, y) = x âˆ— y the multiplication in A. We denote also
           La (x) = a âˆ— x, Aa (x, y) = (x âˆ— a) âˆ— y + (y âˆ— a) âˆ— x âˆ’ a âˆ— (x âˆ— y), (0.1)


               S = {La , [La , Lb ] | âˆ€a, b âˆˆ U}, UÌ„ = {AÌ„, Aa | âˆ€a âˆˆ U}, (0.2)
where {...} is the linear span of elements in the braces.
  Consider a direct sum
                                        U âŠ• S âŠ• UÌ„. (0.3)
     Let
                              a, b âˆˆ U,     S, S1 , S2 âˆˆ S.    (0.4)
     Define
    [a, b] = 0, [AÌ„, Ab ] = 0, [Aa , Ab ] = 0, [S, a] = S(a), [S1 , S2 ] = S1 S2 âˆ’ S2 S1 , (0.5)

                            [AÌ„, La ] = Aa , [Aa , Lb ] = Aaâˆ—b . (3.6)
Theorem 1. The space (0.3) with the commutation relations (0.5) and (0.6) is a

graded Lie algebra
                                L(A) = Uâˆ’1 âŠ• U0 âŠ• U1 ,        (0.7)
where Uâˆ’1 = U, U0 = S, U1 = UÌ„ .

  Remark 1. The multiplication in the Jordan algebra A can be restored as a
double commutator [[AÌ„, x], y] âˆ€x, y âˆˆ Uâˆ’1 .
  Example 1. Let An be a Jordan algebra of matrices of order n with operation
B âˆ— C = BC + CB.

    Â§2 Jacobsonâ€™s definition of a representation of a Jordan algebra
   Let A be a Jordan algebra with multiplication (x, y) â†’ xy and Ï† : A â†’ End V
be a linear map.
   Consider a new algebra AÌ‚ on the space A âŠ• V with multiplication:
      x âˆ— y = xy, u âˆ— v = 0, x âˆ— v = v âˆ— x = Ï†(x)v âˆ€(x, y âˆˆ A, u, v âˆˆ V ). (1.1)
In other words, AÌ‚ is a semi-direct sum of the given Jordan algebra A and an ideal
V with zero product.
   Definition 1. A linear map Ï† of a Jordan algebra A into End V is called a
Jacobson representation in V if AÌ‚ is a Jordan algebra.
   A similar definition in the Lie algebra case is equivalent to the ordinary one. In a
Jordan algebra case the notions of usual and Jacobson representations are different.
   The notions of irreducibility and of equivalence of Jacobson representations can
be given in a natural way.
   Let A be a Jordan algebra with multiplication x âˆ— y. Let La (x) = a âˆ— x. It is
easy to show that the mapping a 7â†’ La is a Jacobson representation in the space
of the algebra A. It is natural to call this representation the adjoint representation.
Thus any Jordan algebra has at least one Jacobson representation.
  Theorem 2. (N.Jacobson [2]) There is only a finite number of classes of irre-
ducible Jacobson representations up to equivalence.
            Â§3 Generalized representations of a Jordan algebra
  Let V be a linear space and a âˆˆ End V . We denote by âˆ—a the multiplication on
End V given by the formula
                x âˆ—a y = [[x, a], y] = xay + yax âˆ’ axy âˆ’ yxa.       (2.1)
  Let us call the space End V with the multiplication âˆ—a the algebra Enda V .
  Definition 2. A homomorphism Ï€ of an algebra A with unit e into some algebra
End a V is called a generalized representation of A if
                                [a, [Ï€(e), a]] = a. (2.2)
  Example 2. Let A be a Jordan algebra and Ï† be its usual representation in an
n-dimensional linear space V , i.e., let Ï† be a linear map of A in End V such that

                        Ï†(x Â· y) = Ï†(x)Ï†(y) + Ï†(y)Ï†(x).     (2.3)

   Consider a 2n-dimensional space VÌ‚ = Vâˆ’ âŠ• V+ , where Vâˆ’ and V+ are copies of
V . Consider in this space the following linear operators with matrices:
                                                         
                             0 0                   0 Ï†(x)
                     a=               , Ï€(x) =                .
                            E 0                    0    0
   Then it is easy to check that Ï€ is a generalized representation of the algebra A
into Enda VÌ‚ . Indeed,
                                                                  
                        0 Ï†(x Â· y)         0 Ï†(x)Ï†(y) + Ï†(y)Ï†(x)
          Ï€(x Â· y) =                   =                                =
                        0     0            0             0

                            = [[Ï€(x), a], Ï€(y)] = Ï€(x) âˆ—a Ï€(y),
and it is easy to see that (2.2) is also fulfilled.
    Thus to any usual representation Ï† of a Jordan algebra A in a linear space
V there corresponds a generalized representation of this algebra A in the double
linear space VÌ‚ . We call the latter representation a generalized representation of A
associated with a usual representation Ï† .
    Example 3. Let A be a Jordan algebra with a multiplication (x, y) 7â†’ xy and
Ï† be its Jacobson representation in the space V . In other words, the algebra AÌ‚
defined on the space A âŠ• V with the multiplication (1.1) is a Jordan algebra.
    Let us consider the Lie algebra L(AÌ‚) = Wâˆ’1 âŠ• W0 âŠ• W1 . It is easy to see that
L(AÌ‚) = L(A) âŠ• VÌ‚ , where L(A) = Uâˆ’1 âŠ• U0 âŠ• U1 and VÌ‚ = Vâˆ’1 âŠ• V0 âŠ• V1 is a graded
commutative ideal in L(AÌ‚) with Vâˆ’1 = V .
    Denote by a the element x 7â†’ [AÌ„, x] âˆˆ End(VÌ‚ ) where AÌ„ is the element of U1 âŠ‚ W1
such that [[AÌ„, x], y] = x âˆ— y âˆ€x, y âˆˆ Uâˆ’1 , where âˆ— is the multiplication in the algebra
A. Then the mapping Ï€ of A = Uâˆ’1 into End(VÌ‚ ) defined by Ï€ : b 7â†’ [b, x], x âˆˆ VÌ‚
is a generalized representation of A into algebra Enda (VÌ‚ ).
    Thus to any Jacobson representation Ï† of a Jordan algebra A in a linear space
V there corresponds a generalized representation of this algebra A in a linear space
VÌ‚ , which we call a generalized representation of A associated with a Jacobson rep-
resentation Ï† .
    Let Ï€ : A â†’ Enda V be a generalized representation of a Jordan algebra A
and W âŠ‚ V be an invariant subspace with respect to a and Ï€(A). Denote by
Ï† : Ï€(A) âˆª {a} â†’ End W a homomorphism defined by the restriction of elements
of Ï€(A) âˆª {a} to the space W .
    Then the mapping Ï€W : A â†’ EndÏ†(a) W defined by Ï€W (x) = Ï†(Ï€(x)) is a
generalized representation of A called a subrepresentation of Ï€.
    Definition 3. A generalized representation Ï€ is called irreducible if Ï€ has no
subrepresentations.
    Definition 4. Two generalized representations Ï€ : A â†’ Enda V and Î½ : A â†’
Endb W are called equivalent if there exists an isomorphism f : V â†’ W such that
f Ï€(x) = Î½f (x) if x âˆˆ V and f a = bf .
    Let A be a Jordan algebra with unit and Ï€ be a representation of Lie algebra
L(A). Denote by Î¦(Ï€) the restriction of Ï€ to the subspace Uâˆ’1 .
    Lemma. Let Ï€ be a representation of L(A) in the space V . The mapping Î¦
associates to it a generalized representation of Jordan algebra A in EndÏ€(AÌ„) V .
    The proof is very simple:
    Î¦(Ï€)(A(x, y)) = Ï€([[[AÌ„, x], y]) = [[Ï€([AÌ„), Ï€(x)], Ï€(y)] = Î¦(Ï€(x)) âˆ—a Î¦(Ï€(y)), (2.4)

                                                                       5


where a = Ï€(AÌ„). The second condition (2.2) is also fulfilled:
                 [Ï€(AÌ„), [Ï€(e), Ï€(AÌ„)]] = Ï€([AÌ„, [e, AÌ„]] = Ï€(AÌ„),   (2.5)
because [AÌ„, [e, AÌ„]] = AÌ„ in the algebra Lie L(A).
  The following statement allows to describe all irreducible representations of a
Jordan algebra with unit.

   Theorem 3. The mapping Î¦ defines a one-to-one correspondence between irre-
ducible linear representations of Lie algebra L(A) and irreducible generalized rep-
resentations of Jordan algebra A.
            Â§4 The graded representations of graded Lie algebras
                and the order of generalized representations
  Let G be a graded Lie algebra
                G = Uâˆ’k âŠ• Â· Â· Â· âŠ• Uâˆ’1 âŠ• U0 âŠ• U1 âŠ• Â· Â· Â· âŠ• Um ,        (3.1)
   Let Ï€ be a representation of G in the linear space V . An l-grading of Ï€ is a
presentation of V as a direct sum:
                           V = V1 âŠ• V2 âŠ• Â· Â· Â· âŠ• Vl ,     (3.2)
such that
                               Ï€(Ui )Vj âŠ‚ Vi+j .     (3.3)
   A representation Ï€ of G in the linear space V equipped with an l-grading is
called an l-graded representation. The number l is called the length of the graded
representation Ï€.
   Example 4. Let An be a Jordan algebra of matrices of order n with the opera-
tion B âˆ— C = BC + CB. Consider the graded Lie algebra A2nâˆ’1 = Uâˆ’1 âŠ• U0 âŠ• U1
from example 1. The representation of this algebra given there is 2-graded:

                                     V = V1 âŠ• V2 ,
where V1 is the linear subspace spanned by the first n coordinate vectors and V2 is
the linear subspace spanned by the last n coordinate vectors.
    Definition 5. A generalized representation of a Jordan algebra A is of order
l if it has the form Î¦(Ï€), where Ï€ is an l-graded representation of the Lie algebra
L(A).
    Remark 2. As Examples 2 and 3 show, a generalized representation of Jordan
algebra A associated with the usual (the Jacobson) representation is of order 2
(order 3).

   Theorem 4. To find all usual (all Jacobson) representations of a Jordan algebra
A it is enough to find all 2-graded (3-graded) representations Ï€ of the Lie algebra
L(A) = Uâˆ’1 âŠ• U0 âŠ• U1 and consider Î¦(Ï€).
   In particular, a Jordan algebra A is special iff the Lie algebra L(A) has a 2-graded
representation.

   Corollary (See [1],[2],[3]). The exceptional Jordan algebra E3 has no usual
representations.
   This classical result follows also from the following simple fact: the graded Lie
algebra E7 = L(E3 ) = Uâˆ’1 âŠ• U0 âŠ• U1 has no 2-graded representations.

        Â§5 Classification of irreducible generalized representations
                         of simple Jordan algebras.
    To classify irreducible generalized representations of simple Jordan algebras we
first will describe all gradings of irreducible representations of graded simple Lie
algebras.
    Recall that a grading of a semisimple Lie algebra G is defined by a linear function
f (x) on the dual space H âˆ— of a Cartan subalgebra H âŠ‚ G taking nonnegative integer
values at simple roots of the algebra G (see [6],[7]).
                             i=k
                              P
    Theorem 5. Let G =           Ui be a semisimple Lie algebra graded by a function
                           i=âˆ’k
f . Then a linear space V of a representation Ï€ of G with the highest weight Î› can
be equipped with a grading such that Ï€ becomes an l-graded representation with
                                l = f (Î›) + f (i(Î›)) + 1,
where i is a Tits involution on simple roots of G. The length l is uniquely defined.


   Remark 3. Recall that the Tits involution is defined by a nontrivial involutive
automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of G in the cases G = An , D2n , E6 and the
identity in other cases.
   We will apply Theorem 5 to the special cases when G = L(A) = Uâˆ’1 âŠ• U0 âŠ• U1 .
In all these cases the function f is equal to 1 at some simple root Î±j and is equal to
                                                         Pn
zero at other simple roots, i.e. f (Î›) = Î»j , where Î› =     Î»i Î±i is the decomposition
                                                              1
of Î› into a linear combination of simple roots Î±i .
   Let A be a simple Jordan algebra and Ï€Î› be an irreducible representation of the
Lie algebra L(A) with the highest weight Î›.
   The following theorems follow from Theorems 4 and 5. Theorem 6. The finite
dimensional irreducible generalized representations of a simple Jordan algebra A
over a field C have the form Î¦(Ï€Î› ).
   The orders l of these representations are given by the following list.
   1) A = An , L(A) = A2nâˆ’1 , f (Î›) = Î»n , l = 2Î»n + 1.
  2) A = Bn , L(A) = Cn , f (Î›) = Î»n , l = 2Î»n + 1.
   3) A = Cn , L(A) = D2n , f (Î›) = Î»2n , l = Î»2n + Î»2nâˆ’1 + 1.
   4) A = D2n , L(A) = Dn , f (Î›) = Î»1 , l = 2Î»1 + 1.
   5) A = D2n+1 , L(A) = Bn , f (Î›) = Î»1 , l = 2Î»1 + 1.
   6) A = E3 , L(A) = E7 , f (Î›) = Î»7 , l = 2Î»7 + 1.

   Theorem 7. Let A be a simple Jordan algebra. There is a finite number of
irreducible generalized representations of a given order l.
   In particular, there is a finite number of usual representations (l = 2) and Ja-
cobson representations (l = 3).
          Â§6 An interpretation of the generalized representations
  First we will define a series of algebras Ak1 k2 Â·Â·Â·kl . Let Ust be the space of s Ã— t
matrices.
  The space of algebra Ak1 k2 Â·Â·Â·kl is the direct sum
                            Ak1 k2 âŠ• Ak2 k3 âŠ• Â· Â· Â· âŠ• Aklâˆ’1 kl ,
GRADED LIE ALGEBRAS DEFINED BY JORDAN ALGEBRAS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIONS
                                                                       7


i.e. the elements of the algebra are the tuples
                         x = (x1 , x2 , Â· Â· Â· , xlâˆ’1 ),   xi âˆˆ Uki ki+1 .
   Let us fix a = (a1 , a2 , Â· Â· Â· , alâˆ’1 ). The multiplication âˆ—a in the algebra Ak1 k2 Â·Â·Â·kl
is given by the formula
                (x âˆ—a y)i = xi ati yi + yi ati xi âˆ’ atiâˆ’1 xiâˆ’1 yi âˆ’ yi xi+1 ati+1 ,
where at is the transpose of matrix a.
  Remark 4. The algebra Akk is the Jordan algebra of matrices of order k. Indeed
                                    x âˆ—a y = xat y + yat x.
It is easy to see that this multiplication is isomorphic to the multiplication xy + yx
if a is not a degenerate matrix.
   Theorem 8. There is a one-to-one correspondence between generalized repre-
sentations Ï€ of order l of Jordan algebra A and homomorphic embeddings Ï€ âˆ— of A
in algebras Ak1 k2 Â·Â·Â·kl .
