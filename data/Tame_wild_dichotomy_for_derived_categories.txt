                                                     is based on the technique of boxes and reduction algorithm. It implies,
                                                     in particular, that any degeneration of a derived wild algebra is derived
                                                     wild; respectively, any deformation of a derived tame algebra is derived
                                                     tame.

                                                The notions of tame and wild problems is now rather poplar in various
                                             branches of representation theory and related topics, especially because of
                                             the so-called tame-wild dichotomy (cf. e.g. [3, 7] and other papers). Namely,
                                             in most cases it so happens that either indecomposable representations de-
                                             pend on at most one parameter or their description becomes in some sense
                                             “universal,” i.e. containing a classification of representations of all finitely
                                             generated algebras. Last time these notions have also been studied for de-
                                             rived categories, and tame-wild dichotomy has been proved in some cases
                                             (though rather restrictive ones), cf. [9, 1, 8]. In this paper we shall prove
                                             such a dichotomy for derived categories of arbitrary finite dimensional alge-
                                             bras over an algebraically closed field. The used technique, just as in [3, 7]
                                             (see also the survey [4]), is that of “matrix problems,” more precisely, boxes
                                             and reduction algorithm. There are some new features: we have to consider
                                             such boxes that the underlying category is no more free. Fortunately, the
                                             arising relations are of rather special nature, which leads to the notion of
                                             sliced boxes. Actually, the tame-wild dichotomy is proved for such boxes,
                                             wherefrom the result for derived categories is obtained almost in the same
                                             way as the tame-wild dichotomy for representations of algebras has been ob-
                                             tained from that for free boxes. As it is rather usual, we formulate the result
                                             for locally finite dimensional categories. If such a category only has finitely
                                             many indecomposable objects, this language is equivalent to that of finite
                                             dimensional algebras, though a bit more convenient. But categories with in-
                                             finitely many indecomposables naturally arise in representation theory (for
                                             instance, when we consider coverings), so we prefer to use this language,
                                             especially as this generality does not imply the proofs.

                          1. Derived categories
   We consider categories and algebras over a fixed algebraically closed field
k. A k-category A is called locally finite dimensional (shortly lofd) if the
following conditions hold:
    1. All spaces A(x, y) are finite dimensional for all objects x, y.
    2. A is fully additive, i.e. it is additive and all idempotents in it split.
       Conditions 1,2 imply that the category A is Krull–Schmidt, i.e. each
       object uniquely decomposes into a direct sum of indecomposable ob-
       jects; moreover, it is local, i.e. for each indecomposable object x the
       algebra A(x, x) is local. We denote by ind A a set of representatives
       of isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects from A.
    3. For each object x the set { y ∈ ind A | A(x, y) 6= 0 or A(y, x) 6= 0 } is
       finite.
We denote by vec the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over k
and by A-mod the category of finite dimensional A-modules, i.e. functors
M : A → vec such that { x ∈ ind A | M x 6= 0 } is finite. We also denote by
D(A) the derived category of the category A-mod and by D b (A) its full
subcategory consisting of bounded complexes. The latter is again a lofd
category.
   For an arbitrary category C we denote by add C the minimal fully additive
category containing C. For instance, one can consider add C as the category
of finitely generated projective C-modules; especially, add k = vec. We de-
note by Rep(A, C) the category of functors Fun(A, add C) and call them
representations of the category A in a category C. Obviously, Rep(A, C) ≃
Rep(add A, C). If the category A is lofd, we denote by rep(A, C) the full sub-
category of Rep(A, C) consisting of the representations M with finite support
supp M = { x ∈ ind A | M x 6= 0 }. In particular, rep(A, k) = A-mod.
   We denote by D(A) (respectively, D − (A), D b (A) ) the derived category
(respectively, right bounded and (two-sided) bounded derived category) of
the category A-mod, where A is a lofd category. Recall that A embeds as
a full subcategory into A-mod. Namely, each object x corresponds to the
functor Ax = A(x, ). These functors are projective in the category A-mod;
if A is fully additive, these are all projectives (up to isomorphism). On
the other hand, A-mod embeds as a full subcategory into D b (A): a mod-
ule M is treated as a complex only having a unique nonzero component
equal M at the 0-th position. It is also known that D − (A) can be identified
with the category K− (A) whose objects are right bounded complexes of pro-
jective modules and morphisms are homomorphisms of complexes modulo
homotopy [10]. If gl.dim A < ∞, every bounded complex has a bounded
projective resolution, hence D b (A) can identified with Kb (A), the category
of bounded projective complexes modulo homotopy, but it is no more the
case if gl.dim A = ∞. Moreover, if A is lofd, we can confine the considered
complexes by minimal ones, i.e. always suppose that Im dn ⊆ rad Pn−1 for
all n. We denote by J the radical of the category A, i.e. the set of mor-
phisms having no invertible components with respect to some (hence, any)
decomposition of its source and target into direct sums of indecomposables.
Then rad M = JM for each M ∈ A-mod.

  Even if gl.dim A = ∞, one easily shows [5] that D b (A) can be identified
with a direct limit limN QN (A) of the categories QN (A) defined as follows.
                    −→
   1. Objects of QN (A) are right bounded complexes (P• , d• ) of projective
      modules from A-mod with Pn = 0 for n > N .
   2. Morphisms of QN (A) are homomorphisms of complexes modulo quasi-
      homotopy, where two homomorphisms f, g : (P• , d• ) → (P•′ , d′• ) are
      said to be quasi-homotopic if there are homomorphisms of modules
                   ′
      sn : Pn → Pn+1   such that fn − gn = d′n+1 sn + sn−1 dn for all n < N .
   3. The functor QN (A) → QN +1 (A) maps a complex (P• , d• ) to a com-
      plex
                           h
                0 → P̂n+1 −→ Pn → Pn−1 → · · · → Pm → 0,
      where h maps P̂n+1 onto Ker dn . (Such a complex is defined up to an
      isomorphism inside QN +1 (A).)
Note that these functors are full embeddings; thus all functors QN (A) →
D  b                                                 b
S (A)Nare full embeddings too, so we may treat D (A) as a sort of union
   N Q (A). Especially, in all classification problems, we may replace the
study of the category D b (A) by that of the categories QN (A). If A is lofd,
any complex from QN (A) is isomorphic (in this category) to a minimal
complex P• such that Ker dN ⊆ rad PN . We denote by QN       0 (A) the full
subcategory of Q (A) only consisting of such complexes. Thus D b (A) ≃
                   N

limN QN0 (A).

Proposition 1.1. Two complexes from QN                                 N
                                            0 (A) are isomorphic in Q (A)
if and only if they are isomorphic as complexes.
Proof. If two complexes P• , P•′ from QN                        N
                                       0 (A) are isomorphic in Q (A), there

where all upgoing and downgoing squares commute. Moreover, all products
ψn φn (n < N ) are of the form 1 + σn−1 dn + dn+1 σn , thus isomorphisms, as
well as all products φn ψn (n < N ). Hence all φn , ψn (n < N ) are isomor-
phisms. As φN −1 (Im dN ) ⊆ Im d′N and ψN −1 (Im d′N ) ⊆ Im dN , it implies
that Im dN ≃ Im d′N . Since Ker dN ⊆ rad PN , the latter is a projective
cover of Im dN , and PN′ is a projective cover of Im d′N . Therefore PN ≃ PN′ .
Moreover, φN d′N = φN −1 dN : PN → Im d′N −1 is an epimorphism, hence
Im φN + Ker d′N = PN′ , so φN is an epimorphism, thus an isomorphism. 
   We introduce the notions of derived tame and derived wild lofd categories
in the following way, which do not formally coincide with those of some
earlier papers, such as [1, 8, 9], but is equivalent to them. Due to the
preceding considerations, it is more convenient to deal with.

Definition 1.2. Let A be a lofd category.
    1. The rank of an object x ∈ A (or of the corresponding projective            mod-
       ule Ax ) is the function r(x) : ind A → Z such that x ≃ y∈ind A r(x)(y)y.
                                                                       L

       The vector rank r• (P• ) of a bounded complex of projective A-modules
       is the sequence (. . . , r(Pn ), r(Pn−1 ), . . . ) (actually it only has finitely
       many nonzero entries).
    2. We call a rational family of bounded minimal complexes over A
       a bounded complex (P• , d• ) of finitely generated projective A ⊗ R-
       modules, where R is a rational algebra, i.e. R = k[t, f (t)−1 ] for a
       nonzero polynomial f (t), and Im dn ⊆ JPn−1 For such a complex
       we define P• (m, λ), where m ∈ N, λ ∈ k, f (λ) 6= 0, the complex
       (P• ⊗R R/(t − λ)m , d• ⊗ 1). It is indeed a complex of projective A-
       modules. We put r• (P• ) = r• (P• (1, λ)) (this vector rank does not
       depend on λ).
    3. We call a lofd category A derived tame if there is a set P of rational
       families of bounded complexes over A such that:
        (a) For each vector rank r• the set P(r• ) = { P• ∈ P | r• (P• ) = r }
             is finite.
        (b) For each vector rank r• all indecomposable complexes (P• , d• )
             of projective A-modules of this vector rank, except finitely many
             isomorphism classes, are isomorphic to P• (m, λ) for some P• ∈ P
             and some m, λ.
       The set P is called a parameterising set of A-complexes.
    4. We call a lofd category A derived wild if there is a bounded complex
       P• of projective modules over A ⊗ Σ, where Σ is the free k-algebra in
       2 variables, such that, for every finite dimensional Σ-modules L, L′ ,
        (a) P• ⊗Σ L ≃ P• ⊗Σ L′ if and only if L ≃ L′ .
        (b) P• ⊗Σ L is indecomposable if and only if so is L.
       (It is well-known that then an analogous complex of A ⊗ Γ-modules
       exists for every finitely generated k-algebra Γ.)
   Note that, according to these definitions, every derived discrete (in partic-
ular, derived finite) lofd category [12] is derived tame (with the empty set P).
Simple geometric considerations, like in [2], show that neither lofd category
can be both derived tame and derived wild. We are going to demonstrate
the following result.
Theorem 1.3 (Main Theorem). Every lofd category over an algebraically
closed field is either derived tame or derived wild.
  This theorem will be proved in Section 3. Note that, in particular, it
makes valid the following corollaries, which have been proved in [5] under
supposition that every finite dimensional algebra is either derived tame or
derived wild.
Corollary 1.4. Let A be a flat family of finite dimensional algebras based
on an algebraic variety X. Then the set { x ∈ X | A(x) is derived wild } is
a union of a countable sequence of closed subsets.
Corollary 1.5. Suppose that a finite dimensional algebra A degenerates to
another algebra B (or, the same, B deforms to A), i.e. there is a flat family
             TAME–WILD DICHOTOMY FOR DERIVED CATEGORIES                       5


of algebras A based on a variety X such that A(x) ≃ A for all x from a
dense open subset U ⊆ X and there is a point y ∈ X such that A(y) ≃ B.
If A is derived wild, so is B; respectively, if B is derived tame, so is A.

   If the families are not assumed flat, these assertions are no more true [1]
(see [5, 6] for further comments).

                             2. Related boxes
   Recall [3, 4] that a box is a pair A = (A, V) consisting of a category A and
an A-coalgebra V. We denote by µ the comultiplication in V, by ε its counit
and by V = Ker ε its kernel. We always suppose that A is normal, i.e. there
is a section ω : x 7→ ωx (x ∈ ob A) such that ε(ωx ) = 1x and µ(ωx ) = ωx ⊗ωx
for all x. A category A is called free if it is isomorphic to a path category
kΓ of an oriented graph (quiver) Γ, and semi-free if A = kΓ[L−1 ], where L
is a set of loops, i.e. arrows a : x → x from Γ. The arrows a : x → y with
x 6= y will be called edges. If Γ contains no arrows at all, the category A is
called trivial; if Γ only has loops, and at most one loop at every vertex x, A
is called minimal. A normal box A = (A, V) is called free (semi-free) if so
is the category A, while the kernel V is a free A-bimodule. If we fix a set of
free generators ∆ of V, we call the elements from ∆ dashed arrows of the box
A, while the arrows of Γ are called solid arrows. The union Arr A = Γ ∪ ∆
is called a set of free (or semi-free) generators of the free (semi-free) box
A. We also call the objects of A the vertices of A, denote by Ver A the set
of vertices, and write Arr0 A = Γ, Arr1 A = ∆. Note that a choice of free
(semi-free) generators is usually not unique, and most of proofs related to
boxes use a change of free (semi-free) generators.
   Recall that the differential of a normal box A = (A, V) is the pair ∂ =
(∂0 , ∂1 ) of mappings, ∂0 : A → V, ∂1 : V → V ⊗A V, namely
              ∂0 a = aωx − ωy a    for a ∈ A(x, y),
              ∂1 v = µ(v) − v ⊗ ωx − ωy ⊗ v     for v ∈ V(x, y).
Usually we omit the index and write both ∂a and ∂v. A set of arrows Arr A
of semi-free box is said to be triangular, if there is a function h : Arr A → N
(called height) such that, for any a ∈ Arr A (either solid or dashed) ∂a
belongs to the sub-box generated by the arrows b ∈ Arr A with ∂b < ∂a,
especially, ∂a = 0 if h(a) = 0. If such a set of arrows exists, we call the box
A triangular.
   A normal box A such that the category A is trivial, is called so-trivial
(trivial with respect to solid arrows). If A is a minimal category and ∂a = 0
for each solid loop, we call the box A so-minimal.
   In what follows we also use boxes, which are not free (or semi-free), but
are their factors. Namely, let A = (A, V) be a semi-free box, I ⊆ A be an
ideal of the category A such that ∂a ∈ IV + VI for all a ∈ I. Denote by
A/I the box (Ã, Ṽ), where Ã = A/I and Ṽ = V/(IV + VI), with natural
comultiplication and counit. Note that in this case the kernel of the box
A/I is a free Ã-bimodule, namely, it is isomorphic to V/(IV + VI). If A is a
triangular semi-free box and the ideal I is contained in the ideal generated
6                  VIKTOR I. BEKKERT AND YURIY A. DROZD


by all products ab, where a, b are solid arrows, we call Ã = A/I a convenient
box. The vertices and arrows of Ã are, by definitions, those of A. Especially,
the notions of triangular set of arrows and triangular box are transmitted
to convenient boxes. Actually, we need a rather specific kind of convenient
boxes, defined as follows.
Definition 2.1.      1. A free box A is called sliced if there is a function
      s : Ver A → Z such that
       (a) s(y) < s(x) for every solid arrow a : x → y; we set s(a) = s(x);
       (b) s(x) = s(y) for every dashed arrow γ : x 99K y; we set s(γ) =
           s(x) = s(y).
   2. A box Ã = A/I, where A = (A, V) is a free box and I ⊂ A is an ideal
      in A such that ∂a ∈ IV + VI for all a ∈ I, is called sliced if so is the
      box A.
 We call the function s a slicing of the box A or Ã.

   Note that if a free box A is sliced, there are neither loops nor oriented
cycles in it. Therefore, if an ideal I is not contained in the ideal generated
by the paths of length 2, we are able just drop an arrow that occur in an
element of I. Hence sliced boxes are always convenient.
   A representation of a box A = (A, V) over a category C is defined as a
functor M : A → add C. A morphism of such representations f : M → N is
defined as a homomorphisms of A-modules V ⊗A M → N . If g : N → L is
another morphism, there product is defined as the composition
                    µ⊗1                     1⊗f                    g
        V ⊗A M −−−−→ V ⊗A V ⊗A M −−−−→ V ⊗A N −−−−→ L.
Thus we obtain the category of representations Rep(A, C). If A is a free (or
a convenient) box, we denote by rep(A, C) the full subcategory of Rep(A, C)
consisting of representations with finite support supp M = { x ∈ Ver A | M x 6= 0 }.
If C = vec, we write Rep(A) and rep(A).
   Given a lofd A, we are going to construct a sliced box B = B(A) = (B, W)
such that its representations classify the objects of the derived category
D b (A).
   We denote by S the trivial category with the set of objects
                     ob S = { (x, n) | x ∈ ind A, n ∈ Z }
and consider the S-bimodule J such that
                                  (
                                  0              if m 6= n − 1,

where J is the radical of A and V ∗ denotes the dual vector space to V . Let
B̃ = S[J ] be the tensor category of this bimodule; equivalently, it is the free
category having the same set of objects as S and the union of bases of all
J (x, n), (y, m) as a set of free generators. Denote by U the S-bimodule

and set Ũ = B̃ ⊗S U ⊗S B̃. Dualizing the multiplication A(y, z) ⊗ A(x, y) →
A(x, z), we get homomorphisms

                               λr : B̃ −→ B̃ ⊗S Ũ ,
                                λl : B̃ −→ Ũ ⊗S B̃,
                                µ̃ : Ũ −→ Ũ ⊗S Ũ .

In particular, µ̃ defines on Ũ a structure of B̃-coalgebra. Moreover, the
sub-bimodule U0 generated by Im(λr − λl ) is a coideal in Ũ , i.e. µ̃(U0 ) ⊆
U0 ⊗B̃ Ũ ⊕ Ũ ⊗B̃ U0 . Therefore, W̃ = Ũ /U0 is also a B̃-coalgebra, so we get a
box B̃ = (B̃, W̃). One easily checks, like in [3], that it is free and triangular.
  Dualizing multiplication also gives a mapping

                                        z

Namely, if we choose bases { α } , { β } { γ } in the spaces, respectively, J(x, y),
J(z, y), J(x, z), and dual bases { α∗ } , { β ∗ } , { γ ∗ } in their duals, then β ∗ ⊗
γ ∗ occurs in ν(α∗ ) with the same coefficient as α occurs in βγ. Note         that
the right-hand space in (1) coincide with each B̃ (x, n), (y, n − 2) . Let
I be the ideal in B̃ generated by the images of ν in all these spaces and
B = B̃/I = (B, W), where B = B̃/I, W = W̃/(IW̃ + W̃I). One easily checks
that ∂I ⊆ IW̃ + W̃I, so it is a convenient box. If necessary, we write B(A)
to emphasise that this box has been constructed from a given algebra A.
Certainly, B is a sliced triangular box, and the following result holds.

Thus the set { Mxy (n) | x, y ∈ ind A } defines a homomorphism dn : Pn →
Pn−1 and vice versa. Moreover, one easily verifies that the condition (2) is
equivalent to the relation
                       L dn dn+1 = 0. Since every projective A-module can
be given in the form x Ax ⊗ Vx for some uniquely defined vector spaces
Vx , we get a one-to-one correspondence between finite dimensional represen-
tations of B and bounded minimal complexes of projective A-modules. In
the same way one also establishes one-to-one correspondence between mor-
phisms of representations and of the corresponding complexes, compatible
with their multiplication, which accomplishes the proof.                  

   Note that we can pick up subcategories of rep(B) that describe each of
QN (A). Namely, denote by repN (B) the full subcategory of rep(B) con-
sisting of all representations M such that M (x, n) = 0 for n > N . Let TN
be the ideal of repN (B) generated by the identity morphisms of trivial rep-
resentations Sx,N , where Sx,N (x, N ) = k, Sx,N (y, n) = 0 if (y, n) 6= (x, N ).
Obviously, the equivalence of the categories rep(B) and Pmin b (A) maps rep-
                       N
resentations from rep (B) onto the complexes P• with Pn = 0 for n > N .
Moreover, it maps Sx,N to the complex T•x,N with TNx,N = Ax , Tnx,N = 0 for
n 6= N . Note that a morphism of complexes from QN (A) is quasi-homotopic
to zero if and only if it factorises through a direct sum of complexes T•x,N .
It gives the following
Corollary 2.3. The category QN (A) is equivalent to the factor category
repN (B)/TN .

Evidently, ind repN (B)/TN = ind repN (B) \ { Sx,N | x ∈ Ver A }.

Corollary 2.4. An algebra A is derived tame (derived wild) if so is the box
B(A).

                    3. Proof of the Main Theorem
   Now we are able to prove the main theorem. Namely, according to Corol-
lary 2.4, it follows from the analogous result for sliced boxes.
Theorem 3.1. Every sliced triangular box is either tame or wild.

   Actually, just as in [3] (see also [4]), we shall prove this theorem in the
following form.
             TAME–WILD DICHOTOMY FOR DERIVED CATEGORIES                         9


Theorem 3.1a. Suppose that a sliced triangular box A = (A, V) is not
wild. For every dimension d of its representations there is a functor Fd :
A → add M, where M is a minimal category, such that every representation
M : A → vec of A of dimension dim(M ) ≤ d is isomorphic to the inverse
image F ∗ N = N ◦ F for some functor N : M → vec. Moreover, F can be
chosen strict, which means that F ∗ N ≃ F ∗ N ′ implies N ≃ N ′ and F ∗ N is
indecomposable if so is N .
Remark. We can consider the induced box AF = (M, M⊗A V ⊗A M). It is a
so-minimal box, and F ∗ defines a full and faithful functor rep(AF ) → rep(A).
Its image consists of all representations M : A → vec that factorise through
F.
Proof. As we only consider finite dimensional representations, we may as-
sume that the set of objects is finite. Then we may assume that all values
of a slicing s : Ver A → Z belong to N, and there are finitely many of them.
Let m = max { s(x) | x ∈ Ver A }. We use induction on m. If m = 1, A is
free, and our claim has been proved in [3]. So we may suppose that the
theorem is true for smaller values of m, especially, it is true for the restric-
tion A′ = (A′ , V ′ ) of the box A onto the subset V = { x ∈ Ver A | s(x) < m }.
Thus there is a strict functor F ′ : A′ → add M, where M is a minimal
category, such that every representation of A′ of dimension smaller than d
is of the form F ′ ∗ N for N : M → vec. Consider now the amalgamation
         F ′
B = A A M and the box B = (B, W), where W = B ⊗A V ⊗A B. The
functor F ′ extends to a functor F : A → B and induces a homomorphism of
A-bimodules V → W; so it defines a functor F ∗ : rep(B) → rep(A), which is
full and faithful. Moreover, every representation of A of dimension smaller
than d is isomorphic to F ∗ N for some N , and all possible dimensions of
such N are restricted by some vector b. Therefore, it is enough to prove the
claim of the theorem for the box B.
   Note that the category B is generated by the loops from M and the
images of arrows from A(a, b) with s(a) = m (we call them new arrows). It
implies
P        that all possible relations between these morphisms are of the form
   α gα (β)α = 0, where β ∈ B(b, b) is a loop (necessarily minimal, i.e. with
∂β = 0), gα are some polynomials, and α runs through the set of new arrows
from a to b for some a P     with s(a) = m. Consider all of these relations for
a fixed a; let them    be    α gα,k (β)α = 0. Their coefficients form a matrix
 gα,k (β) . Using transformations of the set { β } and of the set of relations,
we can make this matrix diagonal, i.e. make all relations being fα (β)α = 0
for some polynomials fα . If one of fα is zero, the box B has a sub-box
                                     α
                             a              /bd   β   ,

with ∂α = ∂β = 0, which is wild; hence B and A are also wild. Otherwise,
let f (β) 6= 0 be a common multiple of all fα (β), Λ = { λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λr } be
the set of roots of f (β). If N ∈ rep(B) is such that N (β) has no eigenvalues
from Λ, then f (N (β)) is invertible; thus N (α) = 0 for all α : a → b. So
we can apply the reduction of the loop β with respect to the set Λ and the
dimension d(a), as in [3, Propositions 3,4] or [4, Theorem 6.4]. It gives a new
box that has the same number of loops as B, but the loop corresponding

to β is “isolated,” i.e. there are no more arrows starting or ending at the
same vertex. In the same way we are able to isolate all loops, obtaining a
semi-free triangular box C and a morphism G : B → C such that G∗ is full
and faithful and all representations of B of dimensions smaller than b are
of the form G∗ L. As the theorem is true for semi-free boxes, it accomplishes
the proof.                                                                 
