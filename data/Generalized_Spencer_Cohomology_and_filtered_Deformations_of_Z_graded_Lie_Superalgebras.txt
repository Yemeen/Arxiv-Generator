0. Introduction.

     Spencer cohomology of a Z-graded Lie algebra g = ⊕j≥−1 gj of depth 1
is an important tool for the study of deformations of geometric structures
on a manifold [S], [GS], [SS], [KN]. It works best, however, when the cor-
responding transitive pseudogroup of transformations is irreducible, i.e. ad-
mits no invariant differential systems, integrable or not. In the primitive
(but reducible) case, i.e. when there are no integrable differential systems,
it is natural to pick a minimal invariant (non-integrable) differential system,
which leads to Z-graded Lie algebras of depth h ≥ 1 [W]: g = ⊕j≥−hgj . This
brings us to the generalized Spencer cohomology (Section 1).

     The present paper is a part of the program of classification, up to formal
equivalence, of simple infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras of vector fields
on a finite-dimensional supermanifold [K3]. Like in the Lie algebra case,
an important ingredient in this classification is the description of all simple
filtered deformations of a given graded Lie superalgebras cf. [SS], [KN], [W],
[G].

     Let L be a linearly compact Lie (super)algebra, that is a complete topo-
logical Lie (super)algebra, which admits a fundamental system of neigh-
borhoods of 0 consisting of subspaces of finite codimension. (The formal
completion of a Lie (super)algebra o f vector fields on a finite-dimensional
(super)manifold X at a neighborhood of a point of X is of this kind.) Pro-
vided that L is simple (i.e. has no non-trivial closed ideals), one can construct
a filtration of L by open (and hence closed) subspac es

                  L = L−h ⊃ L−h+1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ L0 ⊃ L1 ⊃ · · · ,

such that the associated graded Lie (super)algebra GrL = ⊕∞    j=−h gj , gj =
Lj /Lj+1 , of depth h has the properties [W]:
(G0) dimgj < ∞,
(G1) g−j = gj−1 , for j ≥ 1,
(G2) if a ∈ gj , j ≥ 0, then [a, g−1 ] = 0 implies that a = 0,
(G3) the representation of g0 on g−1 is irreducible.

    In the Lie algebra case such a filtration is unique, provided that dimL =
∞ [G], and it is not too hard to classify all Z-graded Lie algebras satisfying
properties (G0)–(G3) (see [K1] or [G]). However, in the Lie superalgebra
case there ar e many such filtrations and it is all but impossible to classify
all Z-graded Lie superalgebras satisfying (G0)–(G3). The basic idea of [K3]
is to choose a “maximally even” L0 ; then the representation of g0 on g−1
satisfies much more s evere restrictions than (G3) (cf. [G]), which makes it
possible to classify such Z-graded Lie superalgebras.

    The next step is to describe, for each Z-graded Lie (super)algebra g of
the obtained list, all simple filtered deformations of g, i.e. all simple linearly
compact Lie (super)algebras L such that GrL ∼    = g. Of course, if g is a simple
Z-graded Lie (super)algebra, then its completion ḡ in topology defined by the
fundamental system g(k) = ⊕i≥k gi , k ∈ Z+ , is a simple filtered deformation,
called the trivial filtered deformation. It is easy to show (cf. Corollary 2.2)
that if g0 contains a non-zero central element, then g has only a trivial
deformation.

     In the Lie algebra case the only remaining examples are the two series
of Z-graded Lie algebras of depth 1, which consist of divergence free and
Hamiltonian vector fields with polynomial coefficients. In these two cases
one can either use the classi cal Spencer cohomology as in [SS], [KN], or
some more “pedestrian” arguments, as in [W], [K2], [K3], to show that all
filtered deformations are trivial.

   However, in the Lie superalgebra case there are many more cases of
Z-graded Lie superalgebras, and only for some of them the “pedestrian”
arguments work (cf. [K3]). Also, we do not have at our disposal a Serre
type vanishing theorem for Spencer coho mology as in the Lie algebra case
(cf. [KN]). Moreover, there are several series of Z-graded Lie superalgebras
of depth h ≥ 2 to which the classical Spencer cohomology is not applicable.

    The aim of the present paper is to show how to resolve these difficulties.
In Section 1 we introduce generalized Spencer cohomology, which is applica-
ble to graded Lie superalgebras of arbitrary depth h. In Section 2 we show
that filtered deforma tions are described by the invariant Spencer 2-cocycles,
provided that g is an almost full prolongation. We introduce the latter notion
since, unlike in the Lie algebra case, not all Z-graded algebras in question are
full prolongations (mea ning that the first Spencer cohomology is trivial),
but all, except for one of them, happen to be almost full prolongations.

    After describing in Section 3 all examples of Z-graded Lie superalgebras
determination of whose filtered deformations was left out in [K3], we apply to
them in Section 4 the techniques developed in Section 2. We find that, unlike
in the Lie algebra ca se, there are three series of Z-graded Lie superalgebras
that do admit a (unique) non-trivial filtered deformation (Theorems 5.1 and
5.2), and the rest do not (Theorems 4.1–4.4). Note that one of these filtered
deformations was discovered by Kotchetk off [Ko], and that the two filtered
deformations discovered in this paper are isomorphic.

   We would like to thank Yuri Kotchetkoff for very useful correspondence.

1. Generalized Spencer cohomology.

   Let g = ⊕∞    j=−h gj be a Lie superalgebra with a Z-gradation (compatible
with its Z2 -gradation) of finite depth h, where h is a positive integer. We
have [gi , gj ] ⊂ gi+j , and we shall always assume that dim Gj < ∞ for all
j ≥ −h.

   Set g− = ⊕−1 j=−h gj . Obviously g− is a (finite-dimensional) subalgebra of
g and hence g− acts on g via the adjoint representation, so that we may
consider H ∗ (g− ; g), the cohomology groups of g− with coefficients in it s
adjoint representation in g. Recall (see e.g. [F]) that the space of cochains is
                                     C ∗ (g− ; g) = Λ∗ (g− ) ⊗ g,
where the exterior product Λ∗ is understood in the usual super sense. The
space of the j-cochains (j ∈ Z+ ) is then
               C j (g− ; g) = ⊕−1≥i1 ≥i2 ≥···≥ij ≥−h (g∗i1 ∧ · · · ∧ g∗ij ) ⊗ g,
on which the coboundary operator d acts as (p + q = j + 1)


          (dc)(x1 , · · · , xp , y1 , · · · , yq ) =
              X
                     (−1)s+t−1 c([xs , xt ], x1 , · · · , x̂s , · · · , x̂t , · · · , xp , y1 , · · · , yq )
          1≤s<t≤p
            Xp Xq
          +             (−1)s−1 c(x1 , · · · , x̂s , · · · , xp , [xs , yt ], y1 , · · · , ŷt , · · · , yq ))
              s=1 t=1
                X
          +              c([ys , yt ], x1 , · · · , xp , y1 , · · · , ŷs , · · · , ŷt , · · · , yq )
              1≤s<t≤q
              Xp
          +       (−1)s [xs , c(x1 , · · · , x̂s , · · · , xp , y1 , · · · , yq )]
              s=1
                          X
                          q
          +(−1)p−1             [ys , c(x1 , · · · , xp , y1 , · · · , ŷs , · · · , yq )],
                          s=1

where x1 , · · · , xp ∈ (g− )0̄ and y1 , · · · , yq ∈ (g− )1̄ . We have then H ∗ (g− ; g) =
Kerd/Imd.

   Note that C j (g− ; g) is Z-graded by letting deggi = −degg∗i = i. This
gradation induces a Z-gradation on H j (g− ; g):
                                 H j (g− ; g) = ⊕l∈Z H l,j (g− ; g),
S. CHENG, V. KAC                                                              1145


where H l,j (g− ; g) denotes the l-th graded component of H j (g− ; g).

    We will call the vector space H l,j (g− ; g) the (l, j)-th (generalized) Spencer
cohomology group of the Z-graded Lie superalgebra g and we will call ele-
ments in Kerd (respectively Imd) Spencer cocycles (respectivel y Spencer
coboundaries). In this paper only those H l,j (g− ; g), for which l ≥ 0 will play
a role. This definition is a generalization of the classical Spencer cohomology
defined for h = 1. We would like to point out that the classical Sp encer
cohomology H p,q (cf. [Sp]) would in our definition correspond to H p+q−1,q .

    From the definition it is obvious that H ∗,0 is the subspace of
g− -invariants in g so that we have

                              H k,0 (g− ; g) = (gk )g− .
The Lie superalgebra g is called transitive if H k,0 (g− ; g) = 0 for all k ≥ 0,
i.e. g is transitive if the conditions [g− , a] = 0 and a ∈ ⊕j≥0 gj imply that
a = 0.

Remark 1.1. The transitivity property is equivalent to (G2), provided that
(G1) holds (see Introduction).

    A linear map α : g− → g is called a derivation of g− into g if for all
x, y ∈ g− we have α([x, y]) = [α(x), y] + (−1)p(α)p(x) [x, α(y)]. Evidently,
the space of all derivations derC (g− , g) is Z-graded so that we may write
derC (g− , g) = ⊕l∈Z derC (g− , g)l . Furthermore every element of g itself defines
a derivation of g− into g. It follows from the definition that H ∗,1 (g− ; g) =
derC (g− , g)/g so that
                          H l,1 (g− ; g) = derC (g− , g)l /gl .

    Let g≤0 denote the subalgebra g− ⊕ g0 of g. We will say that g is a full
prolongation of g≤0 of degree k, if g contains all derivations of g− into g of
degree ≥ k. This is equivalent to saying that H l,1 (g− ; g) = 0, for l ≥ k. Note
that a full prolongation of g≤0 of degree 1 is uniquely determined (since in
this case gj is just derC (g− , g)j , for j ≥ 1); in this case we shall call g the
full prolongation of g≤0 .

Remark 1.2. For most cases the notion of full prolongation is adequate for
the study of filtered deformations. However, in some cases, full prolongation
is too strong an assumption, and should be replaced by a weaker notion,
which we shall call an almost full prolongation. We shall take this up in the
next section after introducing filtered deformations, which turn out to be
closely related to H ∗,2 (g− ; g).

2. Preliminaries on filtered deformations.

    Let L be a filtered Lie superalgebra of finite depth h, where h is a positive
integer. This means that L is a Lie superalgebra with a sequence of subspaces
(compatible with the Z2 -gradation of L)
           L = L−h ⊃ L−h+1 ⊃ · · · L−1 ⊃ L0 ⊃ L1 · · · ⊃ Ln ⊃ · · · ,
such that [Li , Lj ] ⊂ Li+j . We shall assume in this paper that dimC Lj /Lj+1 <
∞, for all j. The filtration in a natural way induces a topology on L. The
condition [Li , Lj ] ⊂ Li+j makes L into a topological Lie superalgebra. We
will say that L is complete, if L is complete with respect to this topology.
In this paper we shall always deal with complete filtered Lie superalgebras.
Let g = ⊕∞ j=−h gj , where gj = Lj /Lj+1 , be i ts associated graded Lie super-
algebra. We let g(j) = ⊕i≥j gi . This defines a filtration on g. The completion
of g with respect to the topology induced by this filtration will be denoted
by ḡ.

    For each j ≥ −h we may choose a subspace Vj of Lj so that Vj ⊕Lj+1 = Lj
as vector spaces. We may identify Vj with gj so that in the vector space
     Q         Q
ḡ = j gj = j Vj = L we may define two Lie brackets. Namely, [·, ·],
which is the Lie bracket of the Lie superalgebra ḡ, and [·, ·]1 , which is the
Lie bracket of the Lie superalgebra L. We have for x, y ∈ g = ⊕j gj :
                                              X
                         [x, y]1 = [x, y] +          µi (x, y),             (2.1)
                                              i≥1

where µi : g ∧ g → g is an even super-skewsymmetric bilinear map such that
µi (gj ∧ gs ) ⊂ gj+s+i for each i = 1, 2, · · ·. Note that for each ǫ ∈ C∗ the map
ϕǫ : ḡ → ḡ, d efined by ϕǫ (x) = ǫj x, if x ∈ gj , is a continuous automorphism
of the Lie superalgebra ḡ, provided that ǫ 6= 0. Applying ϕǫ , with ǫ 6= 0,
to both sides of (2.1) and dividing by an appropriate power of ǫ, we obtain,
letting [x, y]ǫ = ϕǫ ([x, y]1 ):
                                              X
                         [x, y]ǫ = [x, y] +         µi (x, y)ǫi .           (2.2)
                                              i≥1

The bracket [x, y]ǫ defines a Lie superalgebra structure on the space ḡ. If
ǫ 6= 0, the obtained Lie superalgebra, which we denote by ḡǫ , is isomorphic
to ḡ1 . If ǫ = 0, it is isomorphic t o ḡ. We will sometimes call [·, ·]ǫ the
deformed bracket of [·, ·], and ḡǫ with a deformed bracket (or L) a filtered
deformation of g. A filtered deformation is said to be a trivial deformat ion,
if it is isomorphic to ḡ.

    We have associated to a filtered deformation ḡǫ ∼        = L of g a sequence
of bilinear maps µi : g ∧ g → g, i = 1, 2, · · ·. We shall call the sequence
{µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} a defining sequence of this filtered d eformation.
S. CHENG, V. KAC                                                                          1147


Remark 2.1. Of course, a different choice of the subspaces Vj gives rise to a
different defining sequence in general. Hence a filtered deformation may be
represented by different defining sequences. Thus we may study a filtered
deformation by analyzing the effect of a different choice of the subspaces Vj
on the resulting defining sequence. Clearly, a filtered deformation is trivial if
and only if we may choose the subspaces Vj in such a way that the resulting
defining sequence cons ists of zero maps.

    Let x, y and z be homogeneous (both in the Z- and Z2 -grading) elements
of g. The Jacobi identity in ḡǫ gives

 [x, [y, z]ǫ ]ǫ = [[x, y]ǫ , z]ǫ + p(x, y)[y, [x, z]ǫ ]ǫ ,   where p(x, y) = (−1)p(x)p(y) .

Substituting (2.2) into this expression gives an identity in power series in ǫ
with coefficients in g. We collect the coefficient of ǫk and obtain the following
identity in g:
                                               X
         [x, µk (y, z)] + µk (x, [y, z]) +             µi (x, µj (y, z))
                                             1≤i,j<k
                                               X
  = µk ([x, y], z) + [µk (x, y), z] +                  µi (µj (x, y), z) + p(x, y)[y, µk (x, z)]
                                             1≤i,j<k
                                              X
  + p(x, y)µk (y, [x, z]) + p(x, y)                   µi (y, µj (x, z)).                  (2.3)
                                            1≤i,j<k


Proposition 2.1. The first non-zero term µk in (2.2) is an even 2-cocycle
of g with coefficients in the adjoint representation.

Proof.     Since µi = 0 for all i < k, from (2.3) we get

[x, µk (y, z)] + µk (x, [y, z]) = µk ([x, y], z) + [µk (x, y), z]
                                    + p(x, y)[y, µk (x, z)]
                                    + p(x, y)µk (y, [x, z]).                              (2.4)

But this precisely means that µk is a 2-cocycle.

    We rewrite (2.4) as

                  µk (x, [y, z]) − [µk (x, y), z] − p(x, y)[y, µk (x, z)] =

                   µk ([x, y], z) + p(x, y)µk (y, [x, z]) − [x, µk (y, z)].
The right hand side above is precisely

                                          x · µk (y, z),

while the left hand side is −dfxk (y, z), where fxk : g → g is given by fxk (y) =
µk (x, y) and d is the coboundary operator. Thus it follows from the proof of
Proposition 2.1 that (2.3) may be rewritten as
                                           X                                X
x · µk (y, z) + dfx (y, z) = −                      µi (x, µj (y, z)) +             µi (µj (x, y), z)
                                        1≤i,j<k                           1≤i,j<k
                                                    X
                              + p(x, y)                  µi (y, µj (x, z)),                        (2.5)
                                              1≤i,j<k

Of course (2.3) can also be rewritten as
                         X                                  X
dµk (x, y, z) = −                   µi (x, µj (y, z)) +             µi (µj (x, y), z)
                       1≤i,j<k                            1≤i,j<k
                                X
                + p(x, y)                µi (y, µj (x, z)).                                        (2.6)
                              1≤i,j<k


   Here is the key observation (due to Kobayashi and Nagano [KN] in the
case h = 1):

Proposition 2.2. The first non-zero term µk in (2.2) restricted to g− defines
an even g0 -invariant element in H k,2 (g− ; g).

Proof. By Proposition 2.1 µk |g− ×g− is a 2-cocycle. Now (2.5) with x ∈ g0
and y, z ∈ g− means precisely that it is g0 -invariant in H ∗ (g− ; g) (since its
right-hand side is zero).


Remark 2.2. Proposition 2.2 also follows from Proposition 2.1 as follows:
µk defines a g-invariant element of H ∗ (g− ; g), hence it is g0 -invariant in
H ∗ (g− ; g), when restricted to g− .


Proposition 2.3. Let ḡǫ and ḡ′ǫ be two filtered deformations given by
defining sequences {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} and {µ′1 , µ′2 , · · ·}, respectively. Suppose that
(µk − µ′k )|g− ×g− is a Spencer coboundary for some k ≥ 1. Then ḡ′ǫ has a
defining sequence {µ′′1 , µ′′2 , · · ·} such that µ′′i = µ′i , for i < k, and µ′′k |g− ×g− =
µk |g− ×g− . (In other words, one can c hange the defining sequence of ḡ′ǫ such
that its first k − 1 terms are unchanged, and its k-th term becomes the k-th
term of the defining sequence of ḡǫ when restricted to g− .)

Proof.    We have for x, y ∈ g−
                              X                                             X
         [x, y]ǫ = [x, y] +         µi (x, y)ǫi ,     [x, y]′ǫ = [x, y] +         µ′i (x, y)ǫi .
                              i≥1                                           i≥1
S. CHENG, V. KAC                                                                               1149


By assumption µk − µ′k is a Spencer coboundary, hence there exists an f :
g− → g such that df = µk − µ′k . We define an injective map ρk : g− → g via

                          ρk (x) = x + f (x)ǫk ,         ∀x ∈ g− .

A simple calculation shows that
                                        X                                    X
   [ρk (x), ρk (y)]′ǫ = ρk ([x, y]) +         µ′i (x, y)ǫi + µk (x, y)ǫk +         µ′′i (x, y)ǫi .
                                        i<k                                  i>k

But now obviously ρk (g− ) + g(0) = g. Thus replacing g− by ρk (g− ) in ḡ′ǫ ,
which correspond to a new choice of Vj , for j < 0, we obtain a defining
sequence with the desired property.

    Combining Propositions 2.2 and 2.3 we obtain

Corollary 2.1. Let ḡǫ be a filtered deformation of a graded Lie superalgebra
g with defining sequence {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·}. Suppose that H j,2 (g− ; g) has no non-
trivial even g0 -invariant vectors for any j ≥ 1. Then ḡǫ has a defining
sequence {µ′1 , µ′2 , · · ·} such that µ′j |g− ×g− is identically zero for all j ≥ 1.

Proof.      Since µ1 |g− ×g− is a Spencer coboundary by Proposition 2.1, the
filtered deformation ḡǫ has a defining sequence such that {µ′1 , µ′2 , · · ·}, where
µ′1 |g− ×g− = 0 by Proposition 2.3. Now mu′2 |g− ×g− is a Spencer cobound-
ary, hence ḡǫ has a defining sequence {µ′1 , µ′′2 , · · ·}, such that µ′′2 |g− ×g− = 0.
Repeating this procedure, we may make µ′′′   3 |g− ×g− = 0 as well, etc. Since ḡǫ
is complete, we may take the limit.

    Let g = ⊕∞   j=−h gj be a Z-graded Lie superalgebra. Suppose that ḡǫ is
a filtered deformation of g with defining sequence {0, · · · , 0, µk , µk+1 , · · ·}.
Let a be a maximal reductive subalgebra of g0̄ and suppose that either a is
semisimple or has a 1-dimensional center Cc, where adc acts on gj as the
scalar j for each j ∈ Z. By Proposition 2.1, µk |a×a is a 2-cocycle of a with
coefficients in the a-module gk . Due to our assumptions on a, by Whitehead’s
second lemma µk |a×a is a coboundary. As in the proof of Corollary 2.1 we
may find a defining sequence {0, · · · , 0, µ′k , µ′k+1 , · · ·} for ḡǫ such that µ′j |a×a
is identically zero for all j. Thus we may assume that

                              [a, b]ǫ = [a, b],      ∀a, b ∈ a.


    Note that µk : g0 ⊗ gj → gj+k induces a map νk |a : a → g∗j ⊗ gj+k .
It is easy to show, using the Jacobi identity and the fact that µk |a×a is
identically zero, that νk |a is a 1- cocycle of a with coefficients in g∗j ⊗ gj+k . If
1150                             GENERALIZED SPENCER COHOMOLOGY ...


a is semisimple, then by Whitehead’s first lemma νk |a is a coboundary. If a
has a non-zero center, then it acts non-trivially on g∗j ⊗ gj+k and hence νk | A
is a coboundary as well. Arguing as before, we may assume that for all j
                         [a, x]ǫ = [a, x],      ∀a ∈ a, ∀x ∈ gj .

    Now let x ∈ gs and y ∈ gl . Taking bracket in ḡǫ of an element a ∈ a with
[x, y]ǫ we obtain
                                                      X
                                                      ∞
                 [a, [x, y]ǫ ]ǫ = [a, [x, y]]ǫ +            [a, µi (x, y)]ǫ ǫi
                                                      i=k
                                                     X
                                                     ∞
                                  = [a, [x, y]] +          [a, µi (x, y)]ǫi .
                                                     i=k


     On the other hand, by Jacobi identity in ḡǫ the same quantity is equal
to
             [[a, x]ǫ , y]ǫ + [x, [a, y]ǫ ]ǫ
         = [[a, x], y]ǫ + [x, [a, y]]ǫ
                           X
                           ∞                                        X
                                                                    ∞
         = [a, x], y] +          µi ([a, x], y)ǫi + [x, [a, y]] +         µi (x, [a, y])ǫi .
                           i=k                                      i=k

Comparing the coefficients of ǫi we obtain
                     [a, µi (x, y)] = µi ([a, x], y) + µi (x, [a, y]),
which means precisely that the map µi |gs ×gt : gs ⊗ gt → gs+t+i is a homo-
morphism of a-modules for every i ≥ k and s, t ≥ −h. We thus have proved
the following proposition:

Proposition 2.4. Let g = ⊕∞     j=−h gj be a Z-graded Lie superalgebra and let
a ⊂ g0 be a maximal reductive subalgebra of g0̄ . Suppose that either a is
semisimple or the center of a is Cc, where adc acts on gj as j, for every j ∈ Z.
Then every filtered deformation of g has a defining sequence {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} such
that µi (a, g) = 0 and µi : gs ⊗ gt → gs+t+i is a homomorphism of a-modules
, for i = 1, 2, · · ·.

    In other words, Proposition 2.4 says that in every filtered deformation L
of g one can choose a subalgebra a′ ⊂ L0 which maps isomorphically to a un-
der the map L0 → g0 and one can choose a subspace Vj in Lj complementar
y to Lj+1 for each j ≥ −h such that a′ ⊂ V0 and [a′ , Vj ] ⊂ Vj . From this we
obtain immediately the following (well-known) corollary, which takes care of
the case when a has a non-trivial center.
S. CHENG, V. KAC                                                                    1151


Corollary 2.2. Let g = ⊕∞   j=−h gj be a graded Lie superalgebra of depth h.
Suppose that g0 contains an element c such that adc|gj = j. Then g has no
non-trivial filtered deformations.

    From now on we shall assume that g is transitive.

Proposition 2.5. Let g = ⊕∞        j=−h gj be a transitive graded Lie superalgebra.
Suppose that {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} is a defining sequence of a filtered deformation ḡǫ
of g. Then µi is completely det ermined by its restriction to g− × g.

Proof.    Let a, b ∈ g0 and x ∈ g− . We have
                                           X
                                           ∞
         [x, [a, b]ǫ ]ǫ = [x, [a, b]]ǫ +         [x, µi (a, b)]ǫ ǫi
                                           i=1
                      = [x, [a, b]] + [x, µ1 (a, b)]ǫ + µ1 (x, [a, b])ǫ + o(ǫ2 ).


    Now obviously

  [x, [a, b]ǫ ]ǫ = [[x, a]ǫ , b]ǫ + p(x, a)[a, [x, b]ǫ ]ǫ
                 = [[x, a], b] + p(x, a)[a, [x, b]] + µ1 ([x, a], b)ǫ + [µ1 (x, a), b]ǫ
                 + p(x, a)[a, µ1 (x, b)]ǫ + p(x, a)µ1 (a, [x, b])ǫ + o(ǫ2 ).

Hence

[x, µ1 (a, b)] + µ1 (x, [a, b]) = µ1 ([x, a], b) + [µ1 (x, a), b]
                                + p(x, a)[a, µ1 (x, b)] + p(x, a)µ1 (a, [x, b]). (2.7)

By assumption µ1 |g− ×g is known. Hence the only term in (2.7) that is not
determined is µ1 (a, b). However, since g is transitive, µ1 (a, b) is uniquely
determined by (2.7). Thus µ1 |g0 ×g0 is determined by µ1 |g− ×g .

     Now suppose that a ∈ g0 and b ∈ gk . We will argue inductively. Suppose
that µ1 |g− ×g , µ1 |g0 ×g0 , · · · , µ1 |g0 ×gk−1 are uniquely determined. From (2.7)
again we see that the only term that is not deter mined is µ1 (a, b). By
transitivity again µ1 (a, b) must be uniquely determined. Hence µ1 |g− ×g and
µ1 |g0 ×g are uniquely determined.

    Now suppose that a, b ∈ g1 . Again from (2.7) and transitivity we see that
µ1 (a, b) is uniquely determined. Similarly µ1 |g1 ×g is uniquely determined.
Proceeding this way we see that µ1 is uniquely determined by µ1 |g− × g.

    Now µ2 satisfies equation (2.7) up to a function depending only on µ1
by (2.3). Since µ1 is already uniquely determined, we may proceed as before
1152                            GENERALIZED SPENCER COHOMOLOGY ...


to show that µ2 is uniquely determined by µ2 |g− ×g and µ1 . Similarl y µ3
satisfies equation (2.7) up to a function depending on µ1 and µ2 . Hence µ3
is uniquely determined by µ3 |g− ×g , µ1 and µ2 etc. This completes the proof.



Proposition 2.6. Let g = ⊕∞      j=−h gj be a transitive graded Lie superalgebra
such that {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} and {µ′1 , µ′2 , · · ·} define two filtered deformations of
g. Suppose that µi |g− ×g = µ′i |g− ×g for i < k and µk |g− ×g− = µ′k |g− ×g− for
some k ≥ 1. Assume that g is a full prolongation of g≤0 of degree k. Then
ḡ′ǫ has a defining sequence {µ′′1 , µ′′2 , · · ·} such that µ′′i = µi , for i = 1, · · · , k.
Furthermore µ′′i |g− ×g− =µ′i |g− ×g− for all i. (In other words ḡǫ and ḡ′ǫ have
defining sequences that coincide up to the k-th term an d coincide when
restricted to g− × g− .)

Proof. Let a ∈ g0 and x ∈ g− . By Proposition 2.5 it follows that µi = µ′i
for i < k. Now from this, the fact that (µk − µ′k )|g− ×g− is identically zero
and (2.5) it is easy to see that the map fak : g− → g defined by

                       fak (x) := µk (a, x) − µ′k (a, x),            x ∈ g−

is a Spencer 1-cocycle. Hence by hypothesis there exists an element va ∈ g
such that fak (x) = [va , x], for all x ∈ g− . Now set ρk0 (a) = a − va ǫk , for all
a ∈ g0 . It follows that
                                       X
          [ρk0 (a), x]′ǫ = [a, x] +          µ′i (a, x)ǫi
                                       i<k
                                               X
                        + µk (a, x)ǫ +  k
                                                     µ′′i (a, x)ǫi , ∀a ∈ g0 , ∀x ∈ g− .
                                               i>k



   Next let b ∈ g1 and x ∈ g− . Using the fact that (µk − µ′k ), restricted to
g− × g− and g− × g0 , is identically zero, that µi = µ′i for i < k and (2.5) we
may again show analogously that the map fbk : g− → g given by

                       fbk (x) := µk (b, x) − µ′k (b, x),            x ∈ g−

defines a Spencer 1-cocycle. In a completely analogous fashion we define the
map ρk1 : g1 → g such that
                                     X
         [ρk1 (b), x]′ǫ = [b, x] +         µ′i (b, x)ǫi
                                     i<k
                                             X
                       + µk (b, x)ǫ + k
                                                   µ′′i (b, x)ǫi ,    ∀b ∈ g1 , ∀x ∈ g− .
                                             i>k
S. CHENG, V. KAC                                                                    1153


      Now ρkj , for j ≥ 2, are defined analogously. The sequence above, call
it {µ′′1 , µ′′2 , · · ·}, of course is a defining sequence for ḡ′ . We have µi = µ′′i
for i < k and µk |g− ×g = µ′′k |g− ×g . App lying Proposition 2.5 again we
have µk = µ′′k . Also since the subspace V− remains unchanged, obviously
µ′′i |g− ×g− = µ′i |g− ×g− .

    The following is an important remark.

Remark 2.3. In the proof of Proposition 2.6 the only place where full pro-
longation is used is to find elements va , which then allows us to define ρki .
Now we may assume that µj |a × g = 0 for all j, where a is the maximal
reductive subalgebra of (g0 )0̄ , as explained earlier. Using this it is easy to
verify that ρki is an injective a-homomorphism. Hence the map a → va is
an a-homomorphism. In particular, if H l,1 (g− ; g) is a direct sum of irre-
ducible a-modules that are not isomorphic to those irreducible a-modules
that appear in the decomposition of g(k) , then we may always find such va ’s.
Therefore the assumption of full prolongation of degree k may be repl aced
by the weaker assumption of
                      Homa (H l,1 (g− ; g), g(1) ) = 0,   ∀l ≥ k,
and the conclusion of Proposition 2.5 remains valid. We will say that g is an
almost full prolongation of g≤0 if Homa (H l,1 (g− ; g), g(1) ) = 0 for all l ≥ 1.

    Combining Remark 2.3 with Proposition 2.6 we have proved

Theorem 2.1. Let g = ⊕∞             j=−h gj be a transitive graded Lie superalge-
                         ′
bra. Let ḡǫ and ḡǫ be two filtered deformations of g with defining se-
quences {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} and {µ′1 , µ′2 , · · ·}, respectively. Suppose that µi |g− ×g− =
µ′i |g− ×g− , for all i ≥ 1. If furthermore g is an almost full prolongation of
g≤0 , then ḡǫ ∼= ḡ′ǫ .

   The next two corollaries generalize two results of Kobayashi and Nagano
[KN].

Corollary 2.3. Let g = ⊕∞  j=−h gj be a transitive graded Lie superalgebra.
                 l,2
Suppose that H (g− ; g)0̄ contains no non-trivial g0 -invariant vectors and
that g is an almost full prolongation of g≤0 . Then g has no non-trivial
filtered deformations.

Proof. Let ḡǫ correspond to {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·}. By Propositions 2.2 and 2.3 we
may assume that µi |g− ×g− = 0. But then Theorem 2.1 tells us that ḡǫ is
isomorphic to the trivial deformation. d

subalgebra V− = ⊕j<0 Vj of L isomorphic to g− such that V− + L0 = L, then
L∼= ḡ.

Proof. The existence of the subalgebra V− means that there exists a defining
sequence {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} of L such that µi |g− ×g− = 0 for all i. But since it is
an almost full prolongation, Theorem 2.1 tells us that µi = 0 for all i.

Corollary 2.5. Let g be a transitive graded Lie superalgebra. Let ḡǫ and
ḡ′ǫ be two filtered deformations given by {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} and {µ′1 , µ′2 , · · ·}, re-
spectively. Suppose that µi |g− ×g− = µ′i |g− ×g− for i = 1, · · · , k − 1 and
H l,2 (g− ; g)0̄ contains no g0 -invariant vectors for l ≥ k. If furthermore g is an
almost full prolongation of g≤0 , then ḡǫ ∼  = ḡ′ǫ .

Proof. By Proposition 2.6 we may assume that µi = µ′i for i = 1, · · · , k − 1.
By formulas (2.5) and (2.6) it follows that (µk − µ′k )|g− ×g− is a g0 -invariant
Spencer cocycle. Hence by Proposition 2.6 again we may assume that µk =
µ′k . Proceeding this way we show that µi = µ′i for all i ≥ k.

Proposition 2.7. [G] Let g be a transitive Z-graded Lie superalgebra such
that g−2 contains a central element of g of parity δ. If H 1 (g0 ; g−1 )δ = 0,
then g has no filtered deformation L such tha t L0 is a maximal subalgebra.

Proof.     Let 1 denote this central element. Suppose that {µ1 , µ2 · · ·} is a
defining sequence of a deformation ḡǫ = L of g. We will show that there
exists a defining sequence {µ′1 , µ′2 · · ·} of L such that µ′1 (1, g0 ) = 0. From
this it follows that 1 normalizes g(0) and hence L0 is not maximal.

    For a, b ∈ g0 we have by Jacobi identity
                    [1, [a, b]ǫ ]ǫ = [[1, a]ǫ , b]ǫ + p(1, a)[a, [1, b]ǫ ]ǫ .
Collecting the coefficient of ǫ we get
                 µ1 (1, [a, b]) = [µ1 (1, a), b] + p(1, a)[a, µ1 (1, b)].
This means precisely that the map c : g0 → g−1 given by c(a) = µ1 (1, a) is
a 1-cocycle of g0 with coefficients in g−1 . By assumption c is a coboundary,
and hence we may add to 1 an element x in g−1 so that
                           [1 + x, a]ǫ = µ′2 (1, a)ǫ2 + o(ǫ3 ).
This choice of V−2 gives the required defining sequence.

Lemma 2.1. Let ĝ = g + C1 be a transitive Z-graded Lie superalgebra,
which is a central extension of a Z-graded Lie superalgebra by adding a
central element 1 in degree −2 such that [g−1 , g−1 ] = C1. Then ĝ i s the full
prolongation of ĝ≤0 , provided that g is the full prolongation of g≤0 .

Proof.   Let α : g−1 + C1 → ĝ be a derivation of degree ≥ 1. Thus α :
g−1 + C1 → g. It suffices to show that α(1) = 0. Let x ∈ g−1 . Then 0 =
α([x, 1]) = [α(x), 1] + p(α, x)[x, α(1)] = p(α, x)[x, α(1)]. Thus by transitivity
α(1) = λ1, λ ∈ C. But then λ = 0, since α is of positive degree.



3. Examples of Z-graded Lie superalgebras.

    In this section we will recall the definitions and list some properties of
those Z-graded Lie superalgebras whose filtered deformations we are inter-
ested in. Some of their properties are well-known and can be found in [S].

      Let Λ(n) be the Grassmann superalgebra in the n odd indeterminates
ξ1 , ξ2 , · · · , ξn . Let x1 , x2 , · · · , xm be m even indeterminates. Set Λ(m, n) =
C[x1 , · · · , xm ] ⊗ Λ(n). Then Λ(m, n) is an associative commutative superal-
gebra. Let W (m, n) be the Lie superalgebra of derivations of Λ(m, n). Then
W (m, n) consists of elements of the form [K1]:
                               X
                               m
                                           ∂   X
                                               n
                                                    ∂
                                     fi      +   gi   ,
                               i=1
                                          ∂xi i=1 ∂ξi
                                ∂
where fi , gi ∈ Λ(m, n) and ∂x    i
                                    (respectively ∂ξ∂ i ) is the even (respectively
                                                ∂                      ∂
odd) derivation uniquely determined by ∂x         i
                                                    (xj ) = δij and ∂x   i
                                                                           (ξj ) = 0
                ∂                   ∂
(respectively ∂ξi (xj ) = 0 and ∂ξi (ξj ) = δij ). To each vector field D =
Pm        ∂    Pn        ∂
  i=1 fi ∂xi +   i=1 gi ∂ξi we may associate its divergence by

                                 X
                                 m
                                   ∂fi              X
                                                    n
                                                                       ∂gi
                       divD =                   +         (−1)p(gi )       .
                                 i=1
                                          ∂xi       i=1
                                                                       ∂ξi

   Let Ω(m, n) be the superalgebra of differential forms over Λ(m, n) [K1].
Consider the following differential form:
                                  X
                                  n
                             ω=           dxi dξi ∈ Ω(n, n).
                                  i=1

Define the odd Hamiltonian superalgebra [L]
                      HO(n, n) := {D ∈ W (n, n)|Dω = 0}.
1156                           GENERALIZED SPENCER COHOMOLOGY ...


The Lie superalgebra HO(n, n) is simple if and only if n ≥ 2.

    The Lie superalgebra HO(n, n) contains the subalgebra of divergence
free vector fields

                  SHO′ (n, n) := {D ∈ HO(n, n)|divD = 0}.

The derived algebra of SHO ′ (n, n) is an ideal of codimension 1, denoted by
SHO(n, n), provided that n ≥ 2. SHO(n, n) is simple if and only if n ≥ 3.

   In Λ(n, n) we can define the Buttin bracket by
                               X
                               n
                                 ∂f ∂g                           ∂f ∂g
                   [f, g] :=         (             + (−1)p(f )           ),
                               i=1
                                         ∂xi ∂ξi                 ∂ξi ∂xi

which makes Λ(n, n), with reversed parity, into a Lie superalgebra. It con-
tains a one-dimensional center consisting of constant functions. The map
Λ(n, n) → HO(n, n) given by
                           X
                           n
                             ∂f ∂                            ∂f ∂
                      f→         (             + (−1)p(f )           ),
                           i=1
                                     ∂xi dξi                 ∂ξi ∂xi

is a surjective homomorphism of Lie superalgebras with kernel consisting
of constant functions. Hence we may (and will) identify HO(n, n) with
Λ(n, n)/C1 with reversed parity. In this identification we have:

                 SHO′ (n, n) = {f ∈ Λ(n, n)/C1| ∆(f ) = 0},
            P         2
where ∆ = ni=1 ∂x∂i ∂ξi is the odd Laplace operator, and SHO(n, n) is iden-
tified with the subspace consisting of elements not containing the monomial
ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn .

    By putting degxi = 1 and degξi = 1 for i = 1, 2, · · · , n the Lie superal-
gebras HO(n, n), SHO′ (n, n) and SHO(n, n) become Z-graded Lie super-
algebras of depth 1. Since [xi , ξj ] = δij 1 we obtain, by adding C1 to degree
−2, non-trivial central extensions of HO(n, n), SHO′ (n, n) and SHO(n, n),
             ˆ
denoted by HO(n,   n), SHOˆ ′ (n, n) and SHO(n,
                                              ˆ     n), respectively.

     The 0-th graded components of HO(n, n) and HO(n,       ˆ       n) have a basis
consisting of vectors of the form {xi xj }, {xi ξj } and {ξi ξj }i6=j for i, j =
1, 2, · · · , n. This is the Z-graded finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra P̃ (n) =
P̃ (n)−1 + P̃ (n)0 + P̃ (n)1 (cf. [K1]), where P̃ (n)0 ∼= gln , P̃ (n)−1 ∼
                                                                         = Λ2 (Cn∗ )
and P̃ (n)1 ∼    = S 2 (Cn ), where Cn stands for the standard representation of
gln . Their −1-st graded components have a basis consisting of {xi } and {ξi },
i = 1, 2, · · · , n. Evidently the span of {xi } as a gln -module is isomorphic to
Cn , while the span of {ξi } is isomorphic to Cn∗ .

    The 0-th graded components of SHO(n, n), SHO ′ (n, n), SHO(n,       ˆ     n) and
       ′
SHOˆ (n, n) have a basis consisting of vectors of the form {xi xj }, {xi ξj }i6=j ,
{xi ξi − xi+1 ξi+1 }i<n and {ξi ξj }i6=j for i, j = 1, 2, · · · , n. This is the Z-
graded subalgebra P (n) of P̃ (n) (cf. [K1]), where P (n)0 ∼     = sln and P (n)−1 ∼
                                                                                   =
Λ (C ) and P (n)1 ∼
  2   n∗
                      =  S 2 (C  n ),  where C n stands for the standard  representa-
tion of sln . Similarly, their −1-st graded components have a basis consisting
of {xi } and {ξi }, i = 1, 2, · · · , n with the span of {xi } isomorphic to Cn and
the span of {ξi } isomorphic to Cn∗ .

     It can be shown that HO(n, n) and SHO′ (n, n) are full prolongations of
Pn                            Pn
   i=1 (Cxi +Cξi )⊕P̃ (n) and  i=1 (Cxi +Cξi )⊕P (n), respectively [CK]. Thus it
                                ˆ
follows from Lemma 2.1 that HO(n,              ˆ ′ (n, n) are full prolongations
                                      n) and SHO
         Pn                               Pn
of C1⊕ i=1 (Cxi + Cξi )⊕ P̃ (n) and C1⊕ i=1 (Cxi + Cξi )⊕P (n), respectively,
as well. Consequently, in the case of SHO(n, n) and SHO(n,   ˆ       n) the only
obstruction to being a full prolongation lies in degree n − 2. More precisely
we have (l ∈ Z+ )

     H l,1 (SHO(n, n)−1 ; SHO(n, n)) = 0, l 6= n − 2,
             ˆ
     H l,1 (SHO(n,         ˆ
                   n)− ; SHO(n, n)) = 0, l 6= n − 2,
     H n−2,1 (SHO(n, n)−1 ; SHO(n, n)) = Cξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn ,
               ˆ
     H n−2,1 (SHO(n,         ˆ
                     n)− ; SHO(n, n)) = Cξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn .                         (3.1)

Let us denote the vector ni=1 xi ξi in HO(n, n)0 by Φ. Other Lie superalge-
bras that arise in the classification in [K3], and hence whose filtered deforma-
tions we also need to consider are the following four series: SHO(n, n) + CΦ,
                       ˆ
SHO′ (n, n) + CΦ, SHO(n,       n) + CΦ and SHO  ˆ ′ (n, n) + CΦ.

   Let x1 , x2 , · · · , xn be n even indeterminates and ξ1 , ξ2 , · · · , ξn , ξn+1 = τ
be n + 1 odd indeterminates. Define the odd contact form to be

                               i=1

The odd contact superalgebra KO(n, n + 1) is the following subalgebra of
W (n, n + 1) [ALS]:

                KO(n, n + 1) = {D ∈ W (n, n + 1)|DΩ = fD Ω},

for some fD ∈ C[τ, x1 , · · · , xn , ξ1 , · · · , ξn ]. The Lie superalgebra KO(n, n+1)
can be realized as follows. We may define the odd contact bracket on the
space Λ(n, n + 1) by

                    ∂g            ∂f         Xn
                                                 ∂f ∂g               ∂f ∂g
[f, g] = (2 − E)f      + (−1)p(f ) (2 − E)g − (          + (−1)p(f )         ),

             P
where E = ni=1 ( ∂x∂
                     i
                       + ∂ξ∂ i ) is the Euler operator. Reversing parity, Λ(n, n +
1) with this bracket becomes a Lie superalgebra and the map Λ(n, n + 1) →
KO(n, n + 1), given by



                     ∂             ∂f   Xn

is a isomorphism of Lie superalgebras. Hence we may (and will) identify the
Lie superalgebra KO(n, n + 1) with Λ(n, n + 1) with reversed parity.
                                                    ∂
   For β ∈ C we let divβ = 2(−1)p(f ) (∆ + (E − nβ) ∂τ ), where ∆ is the odd
Laplace operator. We set [Ko]

              SKO ′ (n, n + 1; β) = {f ∈ Λ(n, n + 1)| divβ f = 0}.

This is a subalgebra of KO(n, n+1) and is simple if and only if n ≥ 2 and β 6=
1, n−2                                                                  ′
    n . Let SKO(n, n+1; β) denote the derived algebra of SKO (n, n+1; β).
Then SKO(n, n+1; β) is simple for n ≥ 2 and it coincides with SKO′ (n, n+
1; β) unless β = 1 or β = n−2     n . The Lie superalgebra SKO(n, n + 1; 1)
(respectively SKO(n, n + 1; n−2    n )) consists of elements not containing the
monomial τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn (respectivel y ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn ). Note that SKO(n, n + 1; n1 )
is the subalgebra of KO(n, n + 1) consisting of divergence free vector fields.

    By setting degτ = 2 and degxi = degξi = 1 for all i, KO(n, n + 1) and
hence SKO(n, n + 1; β) and SKO ′ (n, n + 1; β) (since divβ is homogeneous
with respect to this gradation) become Z-graded Lie superalgebras. They
are all of depth 2. In the case of KO(n, n+1) the 0-th graded component has
a non-trivial center, namely Cτ , and hence by Corollary 2.2, KO(n, n + 1)
has no non-trivial filtered deformations.

     Now consider SKO(n, n + 1; β) and SKO ′ (n, n + 1; β). The 0-th graded
component is spanned by the vectors {xi xj }, {xi ξj }, {ξi ξj }i6=j and τ + βΦ,
                                     P
where i, j = 1, 2, · · · , n and Φ = ni=1 xi ξi . This is the Lie superalgebra
P̃ (n) = P (n) + C(τ + βΦ). The −2-nd graded component is spanned by
C1, on which τ + βΦ acts as the scalar −2. The −1-st graded component is
spanned by the vectors {xi } and {ξi } for i = 1, · · · , n. With respect to P (n)
                                                            P
this is the standard representation, and τ +βΦ acts on ni=1 Cxi (respectively
Pn

defines a surjective homomorphism of Lie superalgebras from Λ(2n, m) onto
H(2n, m). The kernel of this map consists of constant functions so that
we may (and will) identify H(2n, m) with Λ(2n, m)/C1. By putting degpi =
degqi = 1 and degξj = 1 for i = 1, · · · , n and j = 1, · · · , m H(2n, m) becomes
a Z-graded Lie superalgebra of depth 1.

    The 0-th graded component of H(2n, m) is the Lie superalgebra spo(2n, m).
Now spo(2n, m)0̄ has a basis consisting of vectors of the form {pi pj , pi qj , qi qj }
for i, j = 1, · · · , n and {ξi ξj }i6=j for i, j = 1, · · · , m and hence is isomorphic to
the Lie algebra sp2n ⊕ som . spo(2n, m)1̄ has a basis consisting of vectors of
the form {pi ξj , qi ξj } for i = 1, · · · , n and j = 1, · · · , m. Its span is isomorphic
to the sp2n ⊕ som -m odule C2n ⊗ Cm , where C2n and Cm are the respective
standard representations of sp2n and som . H(2n, m)−1 has a basis consisting
1160                        GENERALIZED SPENCER COHOMOLOGY ...


of vectors of the form {pi , qi } and {ξj }, i = 1, · · · , n and j = 1, · · · , m. E
vidently the span of {pi , qi } is isomorphic to C2n , while the span of {ξj } is
isomorphic to Cm . It is the standard representation of spo(2n, m), denoted
by C2n|m .

   Finally H(2n, m) is the full prolongation of the pair C2n|m ⊕ spo(2n, m)
[CK].




4. Calculations of Spencer 2-cocycles and triviality of filtered
deformations of SHO(n, n), HO(n, n), H(2m, n) and SKO(n, n +
1; β), β 6= n+2
             n .


    In this section we will apply the results obtained in Section 2 and start
our investigations of filtered deformations of those graded Lie superalgebras
discussed in Section 3. Due to Proposition 2.2 our first step should be to
find g0 -invariant Spenc er 2-cocycles. However, because of lack of complete
reducibility of g0 -modules in general, we will restrict ourselves to the even
part a = (g0 )0̄ of g0 , for which we do have complete reducibility (in all our
examples). So our task w ill be first to look for all a-invariant vectors on
the level of 2-cochains and then determine which of those vectors indeed
satisfy the 2-cocycle condition. To find a-invariant 2-cochains we will first
need the a-module structure of gj and then use this to find all the trivial
a-modules that appear in Λ2 (g∗− ) ⊗ gj . So our first task will be to determine
the a-module structure of gj for every j.

    Consider the Lie superalgebra g = SHO ′ (n, n), for n ≥ 3. As usual we
will write gj for its j-th graded component. Here a = sln and we denote by
   P                                                        P
R( i ki πi ) the irreducible sln -module with highest weight i ki πi , where πi
is the i-th fundamental weight of sln . Below we will list the structure of gj
as sln -modules and also include explicitly a highest weight vector.

                    {R(πn−2 ), ξn ξn−1 }

                    {R(π1 + πn−2 ), x1 ξn ξn−1 },
                    {R(πn−3 ), ξn ξn−1 ξn−2 }

                           ..
                            .
           gn−2      : {R(nπ1 ), xn1 }, {R((n − 1)π1 + πn−1 ), x1n−1 ξn },
                     {R((n − 2)π1 + πn−2 ), x1n−2 ξn ξn−1 }, · · · ,
                     {R(2π1 ), x1 ξn · · · ξ2 }, {R(0), ξn ξn−1 · · · ξ1 }
           gn−1      : {R((n + 1)π1 ), xn+1
                                        1   }, {R(nπ1 + πn−1 ), xn1 ξn },
                     {R((n − 1)π1 + πn−2 ), x1n−1 ξn ξn−1 }, · · · ,
                     {R(3π1 ), x21 ξn · · · ξ2 }
                         ..
                          .

Note that the structure as an sln -module of SHO(n, n) is exactly the same
except that the component {R(0), ξn ξn−1 · · · ξ1 } is removed in gn−2 .

     For i = 1, · · · , n let fi , θi ∈ g∗−1 be such that fi (xj ) = δij , fi (ξj ) = 0,
θi (xj ) = 0 and θi (ξj ) = δij . Note that since the map Λ(n, n) → HO(n, n) is
odd (see Section 3), we have to rever se parity in Λ(n, n) in order to get the
correct parity. Hence p(fi ) = 1̄ and p(θi ) = 0̄. Evidently the span of {fi }
is the sln -module R(πn−1 ) with highest weight vector fn , while the span of
{θi } is R(π1 ) with highest weight vector θ1 . So using our notation Λ2 (g∗−1 )
consists of the following irreducible components with highest weight vectors:

                                                                                X
                                                                                n
    {R(2πn−1 ), fn2 }, {R(π1      + πn−1 ), θ1 fn }, {R(π2 ), θ1 θ2 }, {R(0),         fi θi }.
                                                                                i=1

So to find trivial sln -modules in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gj we need to find modules in the
table above that are contragredient to these modules in Λ2 (g∗−1 ).

    Let g = SHO(n, n) or g = SHO′ (n, n) n ≥ 3. In the case when n = 3
g−1 ∼
    = R(π1 )⊕R(π2 ).PHence there exits a trivial sl3 -module in Λ2 (g∗−1 )⊗ g−1 ,
given by the vector 3i=1 θi∗ ⊗ xi , where θi∗ stands for the Hodge dual of θi .
However this vector is odd, hence it cannot give a deformation. For n > 3
there are no trivial sln -modules in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g−1 .

   Now for n ≥ 3 we have the following linearly independent sln -invariant
vectors in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g0 :
                        X
               c1 =             f i f j ⊗ xi xj ,
                         i,j
                          X
                        1 n−1
               c2 =           (fi θi − fi+1 θi+1 ) ⊗ (xi ξi − xi+1 ξi+1 )
                        2 i=1
                        X
                    +           f i θ j ⊗ xi ξ j ,
                        i6=j
1162                          GENERALIZED SPENCER COHOMOLOGY ...

                       X
              c3 =           θ i θ j ⊗ ξi ξj .
                       i<j



   But c1 , c2 , c3 are all odd vectors, hence they cannot give deformations.

   In Λ2 (g∗−1 )⊗gn−2 we have the following sln -invariant vector in SHO(n, n):
                                          X
                                  c1 =            fi fj ⊗ xi ξj∗ ,
                                            i,j

where ξj∗ again denotes the Hodge dual of ξj . However,

                       dc1 (ξ1 , x1 , x1 ) = −[ξ1 , x1 ξ1∗ ] 6= 0.

Hence c1 is not a cocycle. In the case of SHO′ (n, n) there is an additional
sln -invariant vector in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gn−2 that is not proportional to c1 , namely

                                     X
                                     n
                             c2 =           f i θ i ⊗ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn .
                                      i=1

It is subject to direct verification that c1 + c2 is an even Spencer cocycle for
n even. For n odd, obviously c1 and c2 are both odd. We summarize the
above computation.

Proposition 4.1.

    From the structure of SHO(n, n) as an sln -module given in the above
table, we see that the trivial sln -module doesn’t appear in the decomposi-
tion of SHO(n, n), for n ≥ 3. Hence by (3.1) SHO(n, n) is an almost full
prolongation and so by Corol lary 2.3 we obtain

Theorem 4.1. SHO(n, n) has no non-trivial filtered deformations for n ≥
3.

   Next consider the case of SHO′ (2, 2). In this case the maximal reductive
subalgebra of g0 is sl2 . Denoting by R(k) the irreducible sl2 -module of
S. CHENG, V. KAC                                                                   1163


highest weight k ∈ Z+ , SHO ′ (2, 2) decomposes as an sl2 -module as follows:

               g−1     : {R(1), x1 }, {R(1), ξ2 }
                 g0    : {R(2), x21 }, {R(2), x1 ξ2 }, {R(0), ξ1 ξ2 }
                 g1    : {R(3), x31 }, {R(3), x21 ξ2 }
                             ..
                              .
                 gk    : {R((k + 2)), xk+2                k+1
                                       1 }, {R((k + 2)), x1 ξ2 }
                             ..
                              .

   Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ∼
              = {R(2), f22 } ⊕ {R(2), f2 θ1 } ⊕ {R(0), f1 θ1 + f2 θ2 } ⊕ {R(0), θ1 θ2 }.
Here as usual fi (xj ) = δij and θi (ξj ) = δij , i, j = 1, 2.

     Thus R(0) can appear in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g only in degree 2, i.e. in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗
g0 . The following linearly independent vectors span the even sl2 -invariant
subspace in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g0 :

            c1 = f1 f2 ⊗ (x1 ξ1 − x2 ξ2 ) − f12 ⊗ x1 ξ2 + f22 ⊗ x2 ξ1 ,
            c2 = (f1 θ1 − f2 θ2 ) ⊗ x1 x2 − f1 θ2 ⊗ x21 + f2 θ1 ⊗ x22 ,
            c3 = (f1 θ1 + f2 θ2 ) ⊗ ξ1 ξ2 .

    Compute

                dc1 (ξ1 , ξ2 , x1 ) = 0,
                dc2 (ξ1 , ξ2 , x1 ) = −[ξ1 , −x21 ] + [ξ2 , x1 x2 ] = −3x1 6= 0,
                dc3 (ξ1 , ξ2 , x1 ) = [ξ2 , ξ1 ξ2 ] = 0.

Hence any cocycle must be a linear combination of c1 and c3 . Now dc1 (ξ1 , x1 ,
x1 ) = [ξ1 , x1 ξ2 ] = −ξ2 6= 0. One checks easily that c1 − 2c3 is a Spencer
cocycle. This calculation also shows that SHO(2, 2) has no non-trivial sl2 -
invariant Spencer 2-cocyles. Thus we arrive at

Proposition 4.2. Proposition 4.1 holds for SHO ′ (2, 2) and SHO(2, 2) as
well.

      k,2      sln
ck ∈ H (g− ; g)0̄ . Recalling that g− = C1 ⊕ g−1 , ck can be written as

                            ck = ck−2,−2 + ck−2,−1 + c−1,−1
                                                      k     ,

where c−2,−2
        k    : C1 × C1 → gk−4 , ck−2,−1 : C1 × g−1 → gk−3 and c−1,−1   k     :
g−1 × g−1 → gk−2 are bilinear maps. It follows from the fact that 1 is central

and transitivity that c−2,−2 = 0. Hence

                               ck = ck−2,−1 + ck−1,−1 .

Now both c−2,−1
            k      and c−1,−1
                         k     are sln -invariant. We have investigated c−1,−1
                                                                         k
in our computation Spencer 2-cocycles of SHO(n, n). Now we need to inves-
tigate c−2,−1
        k     . From our table of sln -module structure of SHO(n, n) a bove,
c−2,−1
 k     can  be  non-zero only for k = 2 and k = n. Let 1∗ denote the dual to
1. Then we have the following choices for a non-zero c−2,−1
                                                         k    :
                                                          P              Pn
     For k = 2: c−2,−1
                 2     is a linear combination of ni=1 1∗ fi ⊗xi and            ∗
                                                                           i=1 1 θi ⊗
ξi . However, both vectors are odd. So this cannot happen.

    For k = n: c−2,−1
                n     is a scalar multiple of
                                       X
                                       n
                                c3 =          1∗ fi ⊗ ξi∗ ,
                                       i=1

where as usual    ξi∗
                    is the Hodge dual of ξi . In this case we see from our
previous calculations that cn−1,−1 is a scalar multiple of
                                      X
                               c1 =          fi fj ⊗ xi ξj∗ .
                                       i,j

We know that c1 is not a cocycle. However, it is easy to verify that c1 + c3
is a non-trivial Spencer cocycle. Thus we have

Proposition 4.3. Let n ≥ 2. Then

     Now consider g = SHO   ˆ ′ (n, n). In this case the calculations of Spencer
cocycles is analogous to the case of SHO(n,  ˆ     n). We write an element ck ∈
                        −2,−1    −1,−1
   k,2
H (g− ; g) as ck = ck         + ck     . As before ck−2,−1 is non-zero only for k =
2, n. When k = 2 this cannot happen as in the case of SHO(n,   ˆ     n). For k = n
                                                                    P
we conclude as before that cn   −2,−1  is a scalar multiple of c3 = ni=1 1∗ fi ⊗ ξi∗ .
However, there are two other linearly independent sln -invariant cochains
of degree n, as we have seen in the computation of SHO′ (n, n), namely
       P                            P
c1 = i,j fi fj ⊗ xi ξj∗ and c2 = ni=1 fi θi ⊗ ξ1 · · · ξn . There are two linearly
independent cocycles in the span of the se three vectors, namely c1 + c2 and
c1 + c3 . However, c2 − c3 = db, where b is the Spencer 1-cochain defined by
b(1) = ξ1 · · · ξn and b(g−1 ) = 0.

    We will now consider HO(n, n). Here the even part of g0 is gln . First
we will assume that n 6= 2, 4. As an sln -module HO(n, n) decomposes as

    For n = 3, there is a gl3 -invariant vector in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g−1 , namely
Pn     ∗               ∗
  i=1 θi ⊗ xi , where θi is the Hodge dual to θi . However, this vector is
odd. For n ≥ 3, there are no non-zero gln -invariant vectors in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g−1
by inspection of the table above.

     For n ≥ 3 there are four linearly independent sln -invariant cochains in
Λ2 (g∗−1 )
         ⊗ g0 . However they are all odd.

    Consider now the sln -invariant cochains in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g2 . They are all
linear combinations of the following vectors:


                      X
             c1 =            fi fj ⊗ xi xj Φ,
                       i,j
                        X
                      1 n−1
             c2 =           (fi θi − fi+1 θi+1 ) ⊗ (xi ξi − xi+1 ξi+1 )Φ
                      2 i=1
                      X
                 +           fi θj ⊗ xi ξj Φ,
                      i6=j
                      X
             c3 =            θi θj ⊗ ξi ξj Φ.
                      i<j

Compute

                dc1 (x1 , x1 , x1 ) = −3[x1 , x21 Φ] = −3x31 6= 0,
                dc2 (x1 , x1 , x1 ) = 0,
                dc3 (x1 , x1 , x1 ) = 0,
                 dc1 (ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 ) = 0,
                 dc2 (ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 ) = 0,
                 dc3 (ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 ) 6= 0,
                dc2 (ξ1 , x1 , x1 ) = [x1 , x1 ξ1 − x2 ξ2 ] = x1 6= 0.

Therefore there are no cocycles in the span of c1 , c2 and c3 . Hence there are
no gln -invariant Spencer cocycles in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g2 .

    Consider now the sln -invariant cochains in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gn−2 . They are all
linear combinations of the following vectors:
                                      X
                             c1 =         fi fj ⊗ xi ξi∗ ,
                                      i,j
                                       Xn
                             c2 = (          f i θ i ) ⊗ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn ,
                                       i=1
S. CHENG, V. KAC                                                                          1167


It is evident that Φ acts non-trivially on c1 and c2 , hence these vectors are not
gln -invariant. Hence there are no gln -invariant non-trivial Spencer cocycles
in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gn−2 .

    Finally there is an sln -invariant cocycle in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gn , namely
                                        X
                                   c=          f i f j ⊗ xi xj ξ 1 ξ 2 · · · ξ n .
                                         i,j

But obviously c is not gln -invariant.

    Next consider HO(4, 4). The sl4 -invariant cochains in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g0 and
Λ2 (g∗−1 )
        ⊗ g4 are as in the general case and the same argument applies.

    There are five cochains now in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g2 , namely
                            X
                    c1 =           fi fj ⊗ xi xj Φ,
                             i,j

                             1X 3
                    c2 =           (fi θi − fi+1 θi+1 ) ⊗ (xi ξi − xi+1 ξi+1 )Φ
                             2 i=1
                            X
                        +          fi θj ⊗ xi ξj Φ,
                            i6=j
                            X
                    c3 =           θi θj ⊗ ξi ξj Φ,
                            i<j
                            X
                    c4 =           fi fj ⊗ xi ξj∗ ,
                             i,j
                             X
                             4
                    c5 = (          f i θ i ) ⊗ ξ1 ξ2 ξ3 ξ4 .
                             i=1


    (Recall that ξj∗ denotes the Hodge dual as usual.) However, c4 and c5
are not gl4 -invariant, and we have seen earlier in the general case that there
is no cocycle in the span of c1 , c2 and c3 .

  Finally consider HO(2, 2).                      In this case the sl2 -module structure of
HO(2, 2) is as follows:

             g−1     : {R(1), x1 }, {R(1), ξ2 }
              g0     : {R(2), x21 }, {R(2), x1 ξ2 }, {R(0), Φ}, {R(0), ξ1 ξ2 }
              g1     : {R(3), x31 }, {R(3), x21 ξ2 }, {R(1), x1 Φ},
                        {R(1), x1 ξ1 ξ2 }
              g2     : {R(4), x41 }, {R(4), x31 ξ2 }, {R(2), x21 Φ}, {R(2), x21 ξ1 ξ2 }
               ..

    In Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g0 the even sl2 -invariant cochains are in the span of the

                                   − f12 ⊗ x1 ξ2 + f22 ⊗ x2 ξ1 ,
                              c2 = (f1 θ1 − f2 θ2 ) ⊗ x1 x2
                                   − f1 θ2 ⊗ x21 + f2 θ1 ⊗ x22 ,
                              c3 = (f1 θ1 + f2 θ2 ) ⊗ ξ1 ξ2 ,
                              c4 = θ1 θ2 ⊗ (x1 ξ1 + x2 ξ2 ).


   However, none of them is Φ-invariant, as is easily seen.

    In Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g2 the even sl2 -invariant cochains are in the span of the
following vectors:
                 X
       c1 =            fi fj ⊗ xi xj Φ,
                 i,j

       c2 = (f1 θ1 − f2 θ2 ) ⊗ x1 x2 ξ1 ξ2 − f1 θ2 ⊗ x21 ξ1 ξ2 + f2 θ1 ⊗ x22 ξ1 ξ2 .

Compute

                          dc1 (x1 , x1 , x1 ) = −3[x1 , x21 Φ] 6= 0,
                          dc2 (x1 , x1 , x1 ) = 0,
                           dc2 (ξ1 , ξ2 , x1 ) = −3x1 ξ1 ξ2 6= 0.


   Hence there are no even gl2 -invariant cocycles in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g2 . Thus we
have proved

Proposition 4.5.

    Recall that HO(n, n) is the full prolongation of g≤0 . Hence by Corollary

Theorem 4.2. HO(n, n) has no non-trivial filtered deformations for n ≥ 2.


                                 ˆ
Remark 4.1. Let g be either SHO(n,            ˆ ′ (n, n) or HO(n,
                                        n), SHO               ˆ     n) and let a
be its maximal reductive subalgebra with respect to which we have decom-
posed g. For n 6= 3 it is clear from the a-module structure of g that the
a-module g∗0 ⊗ g−1 has no trivial a-component in its a-module decomposi-
tion, and hence it has no trivial g0 -subquotient in its g0 -composition series.
Therefore H 1 (g0 ; g−1 ) = 0. It follows from Proposition 2.7 that g has no
filtered deformation L such that L0 is a maximal subalgebra. In the case
when n = 3, the vector 1 and the trivial sln -module in g∗0 ⊗ g−1 have opposite
parity, and so Proposition 2. 7 takes care of this case as well. In fact it can
                           ˆ
be shown directly that HO(n,     n) has no non-trivial filtered deformations at
all. However the remaining two cases do possess non-trivial filtered defor-
mations which turn out to be interesting. Thi s is the reason why we have
                                     ˆ
calculated Spencer 2-cocycles of SHO(n,              ˆ ′ (n, n) in Propositions
                                            n) and SHO
4.3 and 4.4.

  In the next two remarks we will deal with the Lie superalgebras SHO(n, n)
                          ˆ
+CΦ, SHO ′ (n, n) + CΦ, SHO(n,   n) + CΦ and SHO  ˆ ′ (n, n) + CΦ.

                               ˆ
Remark 4.2. Let g be either SHO(n,    n) + CΦ or SHO ˆ ′ (n, n) + CΦ. Here
the maximal reductive subalgebra a of g0 is of course gln = sln + CΦ. As in
Remark 4.1 it follows from Proposition 2.7 that g has no filtered deforma-
tion L such that L0 is a maximal subalgebra. Actually one can show that
   ˆ
SHO(n,   n) + CΦ has a unique non-trivial (non-simple) filtered deformation,
            ′
        ˆ
while SHO (n, n) + CΦ has no non-trivial filtered deformations at all.


Remark 4.3. Let g be either SHO(n, n) + CΦ or SHO ′ (n, n) + CΦ. Our
computations of Spencer 2-cocycles of HO(n, n), SHO(n, n) and SHO′ (n, n)
above also show that g has no non-trivial Spencer 2-cocycles. Namely, the
computation for HO(n, n) shows that all Spencer 2-cocycles of g of degree
2 are odd and so cannot give rise to filtered deformations. Also it is easy to
check that the unique non-trivial Spencer 2-cocycle of SHO′ (n, n) of degree
n cannot be invariant u nder the action of Φ. Thus if {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} is a defining
sequence of a filtered deformation gǫ , then we may assume that µi vanishes
for all i when restricted to g−1 . In particular it follows that [g−1 , g−1 ]ǫ has
trivial projection onto CΦ. Now for n 6= 3 the trivial sln -module does not
appear in g0 ⊗ g−1 and hence [g0 , g−1 ]ǫ projects trivially onto CΦ. When
n = 3, [g0 , g−1 ]ǫ pr ojects trivially onto CΦ due to parity reason. Of course
[g1 , g−1 ]ǫ projects trivially onto CΦ. Therefore [g, g]ǫ projects trivially onto

CΦ and hence gǫ cannot be simple. Again here one can determine all non-
trivial filtered deformations. It turns out that SHO(n, n) + CΦ has a unique
non-trivial (non-simple) filtered deformation, while SHO′ (n, n) + CΦ has no
non-trivial filtered deformation at all.

    We shall next consider SKO ′ (n, n + 1; β) and SKO(n, n + 1; β). Here the
even part of g0 is gln . As an sln -module SKO ′ (n, n+1; β), β 6= 1, decomposes
                                                                      P

In the case when β = 1 an extra component {R(0), τ ξn ξn−1 · · · ξ1 } is in-
cluded in gn . The structure of SKO(n, n + 1; β) is then easily derived from

             ∗

fi , θi and 1∗ are the corresponding dual basis to xi , ξi and 1, respectively.
Below we will find gln -invariant 2-cocycles. Just as for HO(n, n) the cases
n = 2, 4 again need to be considered separately, however, the analysis is c
ompletely analogous and we will omit these cases. For our calculations below
we shall need the following lemma, whose proof is straightforward.

Lemma 4.1. Let f be a monomial in C[x1 , · · · , xn , ξ1 , · · · , ξn ] and let λ ∈ C.
Let o(f ) and e(f ) denote the number of ξi ’s and xi ’s in f , respectively. Then

    (i) [τ + βΦ, (τ + λΦ)f ] = ((1 − β)o(f ) + (1 + β)e(f ))(τ + λΦ)f .

    (ii) [(τ + βΦ), f ] = (−2 + (1 − β)o(f ) + (1 + β)e(f ))f .

   For n = 3 there is an sln -invariant 2-cochain of degree 1. However, as in
the case of HO(3, 3), this vector is odd.

    The sln -invariant Spencer 2-cochains of degree 2 are all odd, and so are
excluded.

   There are six linearly independent sln -invariant Spencer 2-cochains of

       c2 =         (fi θi − fi+1 θi+1 ) ⊗ (xi ξi − xi+1 ξi+1 )(τ +        Φ)

       c5 =          1∗ θi ⊗ ξi (τ +          Φ),

       c6 = 1 1 ⊗ (τ + βΦ).

However, by Lemma 4.1 all these vectors have (τ + βΦ)-eigenvalue 4, and
hence are not gln -invariant.

   We have three linearly independent sln -invariant vectors of degree n,
namely
                                       X
                            c1 =             fi fj ⊗ xi ξj∗ ,

                                       Xn
                            c2 =             xi θ i ⊗ ξ 1 ξ 2 · · · ξ n ,

                                       Xn
                            c3 =             1∗ fi ⊗ ξi∗ ,
                                       i=1

where as usual ξi∗ is the Hodge dual of ξi . By Lemma 4.1 τ + βΦ acts on
these vectors as the scalar (1 − β)n and hence they are gln -invariant if and
only if β = 1. However there are two 1-cochains of degree n , namely
                                X

which are gln -invariant if and only if β = 1. It is easy to check that db1

dc2 (ξ1 , x1 , x1 ) = −2ξi∗ 6= 0 and thus there are no non-trivial cocycles in the
span of c1 , c2 and c3 .

   Of degree n + 2 there are three sln -invariant cochains, namely
                            X                            βn − n

                   c2 =            1∗ fi ⊗ ξi∗ (τ +              Φ),
                            i=1

                   c3 = 1∗ 1∗ ⊗ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn .
Note that they are even cochains if and only if n is odd. By Lemma 4.1 they
are τ + βΦ-invariant if and only if β = n+2
                                         n . Compute (β = n )
                                                              n+2


                   dc1 (ξ1 , x1 , x1 ) = τ ξi∗ + 3x1 ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn ,
                   dc3 (ξ1 , x1 , x1 ) = 0,
                    dc1 (ξ1 , x1 , 1) = 0,
                    dc3 (ξ1 , x1 , 1) = ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn .
Hence the space of cocycles in the span of c1 , c2 and c3 is at most one. We
will construct a cocycle of degree n + 2 in the next section.

   For β = 1 there exists an sln -invariant cochain of degree n + 4, namely
                             c = 1∗ 1∗ ⊗ τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn .
By Lemma 4.1 its (τ + βΦ)-eigenvalue is 4, hence it is not gln -invariant.

   We summarize our calculations above.

Theorem 4.3. The Lie superalgebras SKO(n, n + 1; β) and SKO ′ (n, n +
1; β), for β 6= n+2
                 n or n even, have no non-trivial filtered deformations.

Proof. We shall always assume that β 6= n+2                     ′
                                          n . We know that SKO (n, n +
1; β) is a full prolongation, and hence by Proposition 4.6 and Corollary
1174                          GENERALIZED SPENCER COHOMOLOGY ...


2.3, it has no non-trivial filtered deformations. Since SKO(n, n + 1; β) =
SKO′ (n, n + 1; β) for β 6= 1, n−2
                                n , we are left to consider two cases.

    Now SKO(n, n + 1; n−2 n )(1) contains no trivial sln -module. Thus it is an
almost full prolongation by (3.2) and hence Proposition 4.6 and Corollary
2.3 take care of this case as well.

    Now consider g = SKO(n, n + 1; 1). In this case it is not an almost full
prolongation. We need to go back to the proof of Proposition 2.6, from which
and (3.2) it follows that if L is a filtered deformation of g, then L can be
given a defining seque nce {µ1 , µ2 , · · ·} with the properties that µi |g− ×g = 0
for i < n, µn (g− , a) = 0 for a ∈ g0 not lying in the trivial sln -component
and µn (x, τ + Φ) = λ[τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , x], for all x ∈ g− and for some λ ∈ C.
Furthermore by Proposition 4.6 we may also assume that µn vanishes when
restricted to g− . Of course this only makes sense if n is even. Hence we
may assume that n is an even integer from now on. For a fixed i we let
b = ξi (τ + Φ) ∈ g1 , lying in the irreducible sln -module R(πn−1 ). We then
have for x ∈ g− :
                       [b, x]ǫ = [b, x] + µn (b, x)ǫn + · · · .
Taking x ∈ g−1 we have µn (b, x) ⊂ gn . But the irreducible sln -modules R(0),
R(π1 + πn−1 ) and R(πn−2 ) do not appear in gn . Hence µn (b, g−1 ) = 0 by
Proposition 2.4. Using this fact we compute the Jaco bi identity of the triple
xi , ξj , ξi (τ + Φ) for i 6= j and derive that λ[τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , xj ] = 0. Thus λ = 0.
Therefore µn |g− ×g0 = 0. Now g(1) only has one more trivial sln -component,
namel y ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn . However it has parity different from that of τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn .
Thus we conclude that µn |g− ×g = 0. Now g is a full prolongation of degree
n + 1, which combined with Proposition 4.6, allows us to a pply Proposition
2.6 to conclude that L is a trivial filtered deformation.

    We shall now consider the Lie superalgebra g = H(2n, m). Here (g0 )0̄ is
isomorphic to a = sp2n ⊕ som . With respect to a, g decomposes as follows
(πi and π̃i are the respective fundamental weights of sp2n and som .):



   g−1 :         R(π1 ), R(π̃1 )
       g0 :      R(2π1 ), R(π1 ) ⊗ R(π̃1 ), R(π̃2 )

                     ..   ..
                      .    .

    Continuing using the notation adapted in Section 3, we let dpi , dqi for
i = 1, · · · , n and dξj for j = 1, · · · , m denote the dual basis to pi , qi and ξj ,
respectively. Then as sp2n ⊕ som -modules we have
      Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ∼
                 = R(π2 ) ⊕ R(0) ⊕ R(π1 ) ⊗ R(π̃1 ) ⊕ R(2π̃1 ) ⊕ R(0),              (4.1)
                                                                               Pn
where the two trivial components are spanned by the vectors i=1 dpi dqi and
Pm      2
  i=1 dξi , respectively. We need to make some further clarifications of (4.1):
R(π2 ) = ∅ if n = 1. Also R(2π̃1 ) is understood a s follows: It is irreducible
of highest weight 2π̃1 only when m ≥ 5. For m = 4 it is isomorphic to
R(2) ⊗ R̂(2), where so4 ∼         ˆ 2 . For m = 3 it is R(4), where we identify
                          = sl2 ⊕ sl
so3 with sl2 . For m = 2 it is isomorphic to C+ ⊕ C− , where√     ξ1 ξ2 acts
                                                                          √ on
the one-dimensional spaces C+ and C− as the scalars 2 −1 and −2 −1,
respectively. For m = 1, it is empty.

    Note that all the modules are self-contragredient. Furthermore R(π2 )
doesn’t appear in gk for any k. Also R(π̃k ) are all non-isomorphic except for
R(π̃m−i ) ∼
          = R(π̃i ). Finally the component R(2 p̃i1 ) in (4.1) is not isomorphic
to R(π̃k ) in gk for any k. From this it follows that the only sp2n ⊕ som -
invariant cochains are:

    In Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g0 :
                                X
                         c0 =         dpi dξj ⊗ pi ξj + dqi dξj ⊗ qi ξj .
                                i,j

In Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gm−2 :
                                  X
                                  n
                      c1 = (            dpi dqi ) ⊗ ξ1 · · · ξm ,
                                  i=1
                                  Xm
                      c2 = (            dξi2 ) ⊗ ξ1 · · · ξm ,
                                  i=1
                                 X
                                 n
                      c3 =             dpi dξj ⊗ pi ξj∗ + dqi dξj ⊗ qi ξj∗ ,
                                 i=1

where   ξj∗   as usual stands for the Hodge dual of ξj .

   Suppose that m 6= 2. Now dc0 (p1 , ξ1 , ξ1 ) = 2p1 6= 0. Hence c0 is not a
cocycle. On the other hand
                             dc1 (ξ1 , ξ1 , ξ1 ) = 0,
1176                         GENERALIZED SPENCER COHOMOLOGY ...


                       dc2 (ξ1 , ξ1 , ξ1 ) = −3ξ1∗ 6= 0,
                       dc3 (ξ1 , ξ1 , ξ1 ) = 0,
                       dc1 (p1 , q1 , ξ1 ) = −ξ1∗ 6= 0.


   From this it follows that the space of cocycles in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gm−2 is at
most 1-dimensional. Let
                     X
                     n
                b=         dpi ⊗ pi ξ1 · · · ξm + dqi ⊗ qi ξ1 · · · ξm .
                     i=1

It is an sp2n ⊕ som -invariant 1-cochain such that db ∈ Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gm−2 and
db 6= 0. Hence any sp2n ⊕ som -invariant cocycle in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ gm−2 must be
a coboundary.

   Now if m = 2, then all four cochains appear in Λ2 (g∗−1 ) ⊗ g0 . We have

                                 dc0 (ξ1 , ξ1 , ξ1 ) = 0.

Hence every cocycle must be a linear combination of c0 , c1 and c3 . However,

                              dc0 (p1 , ξ1 , ξ1 ) 6= 0,
                              dc1 (p1 , ξ1 , ξ1 ) = 0,
                              dc3 (p1 , ξ1 , ξ1 ) = 0.

Thus any cocycle must be a linear combination of c1 and c3 . But we have
seen from the general case that it must be a coboundary.

Proposition 4.7. For n ≥ 1 and m ≥ 0

   By Corollary 2.3, since H(2n, m) is a full prolongation, we arrive at

5. Existence and uniqueness of filtered deformations of
              ˆ
SHO′ (n, n), SHO(n, n) and SKO(n, n + 1; n+2
                                          n ).

    In this section we will construct non-trivial filtered deformations of the
                     ˆ
Lie superalgebras SHO(n,    n), SHO′ (n, n) and SHO ˆ ′ (n, n), for n even, and
for SKO(n, n + 1; n+2n ), for n odd. From Propositions 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6
and Corollary 2.5 it follows that such filtered deformations are necessarily
unique.

    Let g be either SHO(n,  ˆ        n) or SHOˆ ′ (n, n). As usual we identify g with
a subalgebra in Λ(n, n) with the odd Poisson bracket. Recall that Λ(n)
is naturally Z-graded so that we may write Λ(n) = ⊕nj=0 Λ(n)j . We let
gj = g ∩ (C[x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ] ⊗ Λ(n)j ).

                                                                               ′
                                                     ˆ
Lemma 5.1. Let f ∈ gj with j ≥ 1, where g is either SHO(n,      ˆ (n, n)
                                                           n), SHO
      ′
or SHO (n, n). Then [ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , f ] = 0.

Proof. Note that we have [gi , gj ] ⊂ gi+j−1 . Hence [ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , gj ] ⊂ gn+j−1 .
In particular if j ≥ 1, [ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , gj ] ⊂ gn . But gn = Cξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn or gn =
0. On the other hand we know that Cξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn doesn’t lie in the derived
algebra. Thus [ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , f ] = 0.

   We define a super-skewsymmetric bilinear map µn : g ∧ g → g of degree
n as follows:
                   µn (f, g) = [ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , f g] if f, g ∈ g0 ,
                   µn (f, g) = 0                        otherwise.

                                        ′
               ˆ
    In g = SHO(n,     n) or g = SHO ˆ (n, n) we define a new bracket [·, ·]ǫ using
this µn , i.e. we set
                            [f, g]ǫ = [f, g] + µn (f, g)ǫn .                 (5.1)

Proposition 5.1. The deformed bracket (5.1) defines a unique non-trivial
                         ˆ
filtered deformation of SHO(n,         ˆ ′ (n, n).
                               n) and SHO

Proof. It suffices to check the [·, ·]ǫ is a Lie bracket. Since [·, ·]ǫ is obviously
super-skewsymmetric, we only need to verify that the Jacobi identity is
satisfied.
               ˆ
   Let g = SHO(n,   n) or g = SHOˆ ′ (n, n). Recall that [·, ·] is a Poisson
bracket, which means that we have
                    [h, f g] = [h, f ]g + (−1)p(h)(p(f )+1) f [h, g].              (5.2)

Here and below we mean by p(f ) the parity of f as an element of the Lie
superalgebra. So for example p(xi ) = 1 and p(ξi ) = 0. We remind the reader
                                  ˆ
again that the Lie superalgebra HO(n,   n) is isomorphic to the odd Poisson
superalgebra Λ(n, n) with reversed parity, which accounts for the additional
+1 in (5.2). We need to check
                    [h, [f, g]ǫ ]ǫ = [[h, f ]ǫ , g]ǫ + p(h, f )[f, [h, g]ǫ ]ǫ .               (5.3)
By Lemma 5.1 µn (a, µn (b, c)) = 0, for a, b, c ∈ g. Thus the left-hand side of
(5.3) is
              [h, [f, g]] + (µn (h, [f, g]) + [h, µn (f, g)])ǫn ,
while the right hand side of (5.3) is
           [[h, f ], g] + p(h, f )[f, [h, g]]
                         + (µn ([h, f ], g) + [µn (h, f ), g]
                         + p(h, f )µn (f, [h, g]) + p(h, f )[f, µn (h, g)])ǫn .

   Thus (5.3) is equivalent to
       mun (h, [f, g]) + [h, µn (f, g)] = (5.4)
       µn ([h, f ], g) + [µn (h, f ), g] + p(h, f )µn (f, [h, g]) + p(h, f )[f, µn (h, g)].

     So we need to verify (5.4) for f, g, h ∈ g. It is easy to see that if one of
the f , g or h lies in gj , for j ≥ 2, then the left-hand side and the right-hand
side of (5.4) are zero. Thus we may assume that f, g, h ∈ gj , j = 0, 1. Now
it is as easy to see that if any two of the f, g, h lie in g1 , then (5.4) gives
again 0 = 0. Hence we may assume that either f, g, h ∈ g0 or exactly one
of them lies in g1 and while the other two lie in g0 . We will consider those
cases separately.

Case 1. f, g, h ∈ g0 . In this case, noting that p(f ) = p(g) = p(h) = 1 and
[g0 , g0 ] = 0 (5.4) reduces to
            [h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , f g]] = [[ξ1 · · · ξn , hf ], g] − [f, [ξ1 · · · ξn , hg]].    (5.5)
Now the left-hand side of (5.5) equals
                          [h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , f ]g] + [h, f [ξ1 · · · ξn , g]] =
                          [h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , f ]]g + f [h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , g]].
The right-hand side of (5.5) is
              [[ξ1 · · · ξn , h]f, g] + [h[ξ1 · · · ξn , f ], g] − [f, [ξ1 · · · ξn , h]g]
              −[f, h[ξ1 · · · ξn , g]] = [[ξ1 · · · ξn , h], g]f + h[[ξ1 · · · ξn , f ], g]
              −[f, [ξ1 · · · ξn , h]]g − h[f, [ξ1 · · · ξn , g]].

Thus we are to show

[h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , f ]]g + f [h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , g]] = [[ξ1 · · · ξn , h], g]f + h[[ξ1 · · · ξn , f ], g]
                                                    − [f, [ξ1 · · · ξn , h]]g − h[f, [ξ1 · · · ξn , g]].
                                                                                                     (5.6)

But (5.6) is equivalent to saying that

             −[ξ1 · · · ξn , [f, h]]g − [ξ1 · · · ξn , [h, g]]f = h[ξ1 · · · ξn , [f, g]].           (5.7)

But (5.7) is obviously true, since [g0 , g0 ] = 0.

Case 2. One of the f, g, h is in g1 , while the other two are in g0 . We will
assume that h ∈ g1 . Other cases are analogous. In this case (5.4) reduces to

              [h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , f g]] = [ξ1 · · · ξn , [h, f ]g] + [ξ1 · · · ξn , f [h, g]].        (5.8)

(5.8) is equivalent to

[h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , f ]g] + [h, f [ξ1 · · · ξn , g]] = [ξ1 · · · ξn , [h, f ]]g + [h, f ][ξ1 · · · ξn , g]
                                                    + [ξ1 · · · ξn , f ][h, g]
                                                    + f [ξ1 · · · ξn , [h, g]],

which in term is equivalent to

     [h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , f ]]g + [ξ1 · · · ξn , f ][h, g] + [h, f ][ξ1 · · · ξn , g] + f [h, [ξ1 · · · ξn , g]]
= [ξ1 · · · ξn , [h, f ]]g + [h, f ][ξ1 · · · ξn , g] + [ξ1 · · · ξn , f ][h, g] + f [ξ1 · · · ξn , [h, g]].

But this is equivalent to saying that

                         f [[ξ1 · · · ξn , h], g] + [[ξ1 · · · ξn , h], f ]g = 0,

which is certainly true, since [ξ1 · · · ξn , h] = 0 by Lemma 5.1.

     Denote these filtered deformations of SHO(n,    ˆ    n) and SHO     ˆ ′ (n, n) by
   ˆ
SHO(n,    n)ǫ and SHO   ˆ ′ (n, n)ǫ , respectively. SHO(n,
                                                      ˆ    n)ǫ is a simple Lie su-

peralgebra. Now in SHO     ˆ (n, n)ǫ 1 is no longer central. But it is easy to see
that 1 − ξ1 · · · ξn is central. Dividing by the ideal C(1 − ξ1 · · · ξn ) we obtain a
filtered deformation of SHO ′ (n, n), which we denote by SHO′ (n, n)ǫ . The
Lie bracket in SHO′ (n, n)ǫ is given by:

     [f, g]ǫ = [ξ1 · · · ξn , f g],     f, g ∈ g0 ,
     [xi , ξj ]ǫ = δij ξ1 · · · ξn ,                                                                  (5.9)
     [f, g]ǫ = [f, g],       otherwise.

                      ˆ
    Define a map ρ : SHO(n, n)ǫ → SHO ′ (n, n)ǫ by

                               ρ(f ) = f,            f ∈ g(−1) ,
                               ρ(1) = ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn .

It is easy to see that ρ is an isomorphism of Lie superalgebras. We summarize
our discussion above in the following theorem.

Theorem 5.1. Let n ≥ 2 be a positive even integer.

     (i) SHO′ (n, n)ǫ with bracket given as in (5.9) defines a unique non-trivial
filtered deformation of SHO′ (n, n). It is a simple filtered Lie superalgebra.
         ˆ
   (ii) SHO(n,  n)ǫ with bracket (5.1) defines a unique non-trivial filtered
                 ˆ
deformation of SHO(n,  n). It is isomorphic to SHO ′ (n, n)ǫ .

           ˆ ′ (n, n) has no simple filtered deformations.
    (iii) SHO

    We define a deformed bracket on SKO(n, n+1; n+2
                                                 n ) as follows (cf. [Ko]):

 [f, g]ǫ = ([τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , f g] + 2f gξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn )ǫn+2 , f, g ∈ C[x1 , · · · , xn ],
 [f, g]ǫ = [f, g],        otherwise.                                                      (5.10)

Note that [τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , f g] + 2f gξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn ∈ SKO(n, n + 1; n+2
                                                                         n ).


Theorem 5.2 The deformed bracket in (5.10) defines a unique non-trivial
filtered deformation of SKO(n, n + 1; n+2
                                       n ).


Proof.    It remains to show that [·, ·]ǫ is a Lie bracket. Set

  µn+2 (f, g) = [τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , f g] + 2f gξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn ,      f, g ∈ C[x1 , · · · , xn ],
  µn+2 (f, g) = 0,           otherwise.

Note that µn+2 (a, µn+2 (b, c)) = 0, for a, b, c ∈ SKO(n, n+1; n+2   n ). Thus [·, ·]ǫ
is a Lie bracket if and only if µn+2 is a 2-cocycle of SKO(n, n + 1; n+2    n ) with
coefficients in its adjoint representa tion. Hence for f, g, h ∈ SKO(n, n +
1; n+2
     n ) we only need to check identity (5.4). It is easy to verify that unless
f , g and h belong to the gln -components generated by the highest weight
vectors xk1 , xk1 ξn and xk1 (τ + βn−k
                                  n+k Φ) (see the table of SKO(n, n + 1; β) in
Section 4) (5.4) gives the trivial identity 0 = 0. Also it can be verified
directly that if two of the f, g, h are not in C[x1 , · · · , xn ], then (5.4) again
gives the trivial iden tity. Hence we are to consider three cases. Namely

    (1) f, g, h ∈ C[x1 , · · · , xn ].

    (2) f, g ∈ C[x1 , · · · , xn ] and h is in the gln -component generated xk1 ξn .

    (3) f, g ∈ C[x1 , · · · , xn ] and h is in the gln -component generated by
    xk1 (τ + βn−k
              n+k Φ).

   Even though we don’t have the Poisson bracket at our disposal, we have
the following useful identity:

   µn+2 (f, g) = [τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , f ]g + f [τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , g],   f, g ∈ C[x1 , · · · , xn ].

Note also that [τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn , f ]=0, if f lies in the gln -component generated by
xk1 ξn and [τ ξ1 ξ2 · · · , ξn , g] + 2gξ1 ξ2 · · · ξn = 0, if g lies in the gln -component
generated by xk1 (τ + βn−k   n+k Φ). Using these identities the computation is sim-
ilar to the one given in the proof of Proposition 5.1.
