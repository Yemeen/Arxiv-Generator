                                                                               Introduction
                                            0.1. In [L, Sec.4] a cohomological construction was given (without proof) for cer-
                                            tain representations of a Chevalley group over a finite ring R (arising from the
                                            ring of integers in a non-archimedean local field by reduction modulo a power of
                                            the maximal ideal); that construction was an extension of the construction of the
                                            virtual representations RTθ in [DL] for groups over a finite field. One of the aims
                                            of this paper is to provide the missing proof. For simplicity we will assume that
                                            R = Fq,r = Fq [[ǫ]]/(ǫr ) (ǫ is an indeterminate, Fq is a finite field with q elements
                                            and r ≥ 1). The general case requires only minor modifications. On the other
                                            hand, we treat possibly twisted groups.
                                               Let F be an algebraic closure of Fq . Let G be a connected reductive algebraic
                                            group defined over F with a given Fq -rational structure with associated Frobenius
                                            map F : G − → G.
                                               Using a cohomological method, extending that of [DL], we will construct a
                                            family of irreducible representations of the finite group G(Fq,r ), r ≥ 1, attached
                                            to a ”maximal torus” and a character of it in general position. In the case where
                                            r ≥ 2 and G is split over Fq , the representations that we construct are likely
                                            to be the same as those found by Gérardin [G] by a non-cohomological method
                                            (induction from a subgroup if r is even; induction from a subgroup in combination
                                            with a use of a Weil representation, if r is odd, ≥ 3). In any case, since for
                                            r = 1, the cohomological construction is the only known construction of the generic
                                            representations, it seems natural to seek a cohomological construction which works
                                            uniformly for all r ≥ 1; this is what we do in this paper.
                                               In contrast with the case r = 1, for r ≥ 2 not all irreducible representations of
                                            G(Fq,r ) appear in the virtual representations that we construct. The study of SL2
                                            with r = 2 (see §3) suggests that, to remedy this, one has to consider also virtual
                                            representations attached to double cosets with respect to a ”Borel subgroup” other
                                            than those indexed by the Weyl group.

0.2. Notation. Let ǫ be an indeterminate. If X is an affine algebraic variety
over F and r ≥ 1, we set Xr = X(F[[ǫ]]/(ǫr )). Thus, if X is the set of common
zeroes of the polynomials fi : FN −        → F(i = 1, . . . , m), then Xr is the set of all
                                    r N
(x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) ∈ (F[[ǫ]]/(ǫ )) such that fi (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) (a priori an element
of F[[ǫ]]/(ǫr )) is equal to 0 for i = 1, . . . , m. We have X1 = X. For r = 0 we set
Xr =point. Then X 7→ Xr is a functor from the category of algebraic varieties
over F into itself. If X ′ is a closed subvariety of X then Xr′ is a closed subvariety of
Xr . If X is irreducible of dimension d then Xr is irreducible of dimension dr. For
any r ≥ r ′ ≥ 0 we have a canonical morphism φr,r′ : Xr −               → Xr′ . If r ≥ 1, we have
naturally X ⊂ Xr (using F ⊂ F[[ǫ]]/(ǫr )). If G is an algebraic group over F then
Gr is naturally an algebraic group over F. For any r ≥ r ′ ≥ 0, φr,r′ : Gr −             → Gr′ is
                                                                        r′
a homomorphism of algebraic groups hence its kernel, Gr , is a normal subgroup
of Gr . For r ≥ 1 we have naturally G ⊂ Gr . We have
                           {1} = Grr ⊂ Gr−1
                                        r   ⊂ . . . G1r ⊂ G0r = Gr .
                                ′        ′      ′
For r > r ′ ≥ 0, we set Grr ,∗ = Grr − Grr +1 . We have a partition
                           Gr = G0,∗  1,∗          r−1,∗
                                 r ⊔ Gr ⊔ . . . ⊔ Gr     ⊔ {1}.
We fix a prime number l invertible in F. If X is an algebraic variety over F we
write Hcj (X) istead of Hcj (X, Q̄l ).
  For a finite group Γ let Γ̂ = Hom(Γ, Q̄∗l ).

with Frobenius map F : T − → T we have a norm map

Lemma 1.1. Let T , T ′ be two commutative, connected algebraic groups over F
                                                             → T ,F : T ′ −

Let f : T −→ T ′ be an isomorphism of algebraic groups over F. Let n ≥ 1 be such
                                           n ∼     n
                       → T ′ ; thus f : T F −→ T ′F . Let
that F n f = f F n : T −
                      H = {(t, t′ ) ∈ T × T ′ ; f (F (t)−1t) = F (t′ )−1 t′ }.
(A subgroup of T × T ′ containing T F × T ′F .) Let θ ∈ T d           d
                                                             F , θ′ ∈ T ′F be such that

θ −1 ⊠ θ ′ is trivial on (T F × T ′F ) ∩ H 0 . Then θNFF = θ ′ NFF f ∈ Td

   Setting t1 = tF (t) . . . F n−1 (t) ∈ T ,        t2 = f (t)F (f (t)) . . . F n−1 (f (t)) ∈ T ′ for
t ∈ T , we have
    f (F (t1 )−1 t1 ) = f (tF n (t)−1 ) = f (t)f (F n(t))−1 = f (t)F n (f (t))−1 = F (t2 )−1 t2 ,
so that (t1 , t2 ) ∈ H. Now t 7→ (t1 , t2 ) is a morphism T −
                                                            → H of algebraic varieties
and T is connected; hence the image of this morphism is contained in H 0 . In

particular, if t ∈ T F we have (NFF (t), NFF (f (t))) ∈ (T F × T ′F ) ∩ H 0 hence,

by assumption, θ −1 (NFF (t))θ ′ (NFF (f (t))) = 1 for all t ∈ T F . The lemma is
proved.

1.2. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over F with a fixed Fq -
rational structure with Frobenius map F : G −     → G. If r ≥ 1 then F : G −      → G
induces a homomorphism F : Gr −      → Gr which is the Frobenius map for a Fq -
rational structure on Gr .
   Let T, T ′ be two F -stable maximal tori of G and let U (resp. U ′ ) be the
unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup of G that contains T (resp. T ′ ). Note that
U, U ′ are not necessarily defined over Fq . Let r ≥ 2. Let T = Trr−1 , T ′ = Tr′ r−1 ,

                    Σ = {(x, x′ , y) ∈ F (Ur ) × F (Ur′ ) × Gr ; xF (y) = yx′ }.

Let N (T, T ′ ) = {ν ∈ G; ν −1 T ν = T ′ }. Then T acts on N (T, T ′ ) by left multipli-
cation and T ′ acts on N (T, T ′ ) by right multiplication. The orbits of T are the
same as the orbits of T ′ ; we set W (T, T ′ ) = T \N (T, T ′ ) = N (T, T ′ )/T ′ (a finite
set). For each w ∈ W (T, T ′ ) we choose a representative ẇ in N (T, T ′ ). We have
G = ⊔w∈W (T,T ′ ) Gw where Gw = U T ẇU ′ = U ẇT ′ U ′ .
   Let Gw,r be the inverse image of Gw under φr,1 : Gr −            → G and let Σw =
{(x, x′ , y) ∈ Σ; y ∈ Gw,r }.
   Now TrF × Tr′ F acts on Σ by (t, t′ ) : (x, x′ , y) 7→ (txt−1 , t′ x′ t′−1 , tyt′−1 ). This
restricts to an action of TrF × Tr′ F on Σw for any w ∈ W .

Assume that Hc (Σw )θ−1 ,θ′ 6= 0 for some j ∈ Z. Let g = F (ẇ) and let n ≥ 1 be

                                                                             Fn

   By the definition of Gw,r , the map Ur × G1r × (Tr ẇ) × Ur′ −    → Gw,r given by
(u, k, ν, u′ ) 7→ ukνu′ is a locally trivial fibration with all fibres isomorphic to a
fixed affine space. Hence the map

            Σ̃w = {(x, x′ , u, u′ , k, ν) ∈ F (Ur ) × F (Ur′ ) × Ur × Ur′ × G1r × Tr ẇ;
            xF (u)F (k)F (ν)F (u′ ) = ukνu′ x′ } −
                                                 → Σw

given by (x, x′ , u, u′ , k, ν) 7→ (x, x′ , ukνu′ ), is a locally trivial fibration with all
fibres isomorphic to a fixed affine space. This map is compatible with the TrF ×Tr′ F
actions where TrF × Tr′ F acts on Σ̃w by

(a)       (t, t′ ) : (x, x′ , u, u′ , k, ν) 7→ (txt−1 , t′ x′ t′−1 , tut−1 , t′ u′ t′−1 , tkt−1 , tνt′−1 ).
                                                          ′
Hence there exists j ′ ∈ Z such that Hcj (Σ̃w )θ−1 ,θ′ 6= 0. By the substitution
xF (u) 7→ x, x′ F (u′ )−1 7→ x′ , the variety Σ̃w is rewritten as
(b)
{(x, x′ , u, u′ , k, ν) ∈ F (Ur ) × F (Ur′ ) × Ur × Ur′ × G1r × Tr ẇ; xF (k)F (ν) = ukνu′ x′ };

in these coordinates, the action of TrF × Tr′ F is still given by (a). Let

              H = {(t, t′ ) ∈ T × T ′ ; t′ F (t′ )−1 = F (ẇ)−1 tF (t)−1 F (ẇ)}.

(A closed subgroup of Tr × Tr′ .) It acts on the variety (b) by the same formula as
in (a). (We use the fact that hk = kh for any h ∈ Gr−1    r   , k ∈ G1r .) By [DL, 6.5], the
                              ′
induced action of H on Hcj (Σ̃w ) is trivial when restricted to H 0 . In particular, the
                                                        ′                   ′
intersection (TrF × Tr′ F ) ∩ H 0 acts trivially on Hcj (Σ̃w ). Since Hcj (Σ̃w )θ−1 ,θ′ 6= 0,
it follows that θ −1 ⊠ θ ′ is trivial on (TrF × Tr′ F ) ∩ H 0 . Let g = F (ẇ)−1 and let
                               n                            n             n
n ≥ 1 be such that g ∈ GF . Then Ad(g) carries T F onto T ′F and (by Lemma

1.1 with f = Ad(g)) it carries θ|T F ◦ NFF to θ ′ |T ′ F ◦ NFF . The lemma is proved.

   The subvarieties Gw of G have the following property: for some ordering ≤
of W (T, T ′ ), the unions ∪w′ ≤w Gw′ are closed in G. It follows that the unions
∪w′ ≤w Gw′ ,r are closed in Gr and the unions ∪w′ ≤w Σw′ are closed in Σ. The
spectral sequence associated to the filtration of Σ by these unions, together with
(a), shows that there exists w ∈ W (T, T ′ ) and j ∈ Z such that Hcj (Σw )θ−1 ,θ′ 6= 0.
We can therefore apply Lemma 1.3. The lemma follows.
1.5. Let Φ be the set of characters α : T −     → F∗ such that α 6= 1 and T acts on
some line Lα ⊂ LieG via α (in the adjoint action); for such α, let Gα be the one
dimensional unipotent subgroup of G such that LieGα = Lα . For α ∈ Φ there is
a unique 1-dimensional torus T α in T such that T α is contained in the subgroup

n such that F n (T α ) = T α for all α.)
   Let θ ∈ TcF . We say that θ is regular if θ|T F is regular.

   For α ∈ Φ+ let ht(α) be the largest integer n ≥ 1 such that α = α1 α2 . . . αn
with αi ∈ Φ+ .

   Let x ∈ (Gα )br , x′ ∈ (Gα )cr where α, α′ ∈ Φ and b, c ∈ [0, r].
   (a) If b + c ≥ r then xx′ = x′ x.
   (b) If b + c ≤ r and αα′ 6= 1 then xx′ = x′ xu where u is of the form

(The factors in the last product are written in some fixed order. In the special
case where b + c = r − 1, these factors commute with each other by (a), since
r − 1 + r − 1 ≥ r.)
   (c) If b+c ≥ r −1, b+2c ≥ r and αα′ = 1 then xx′ = x′ xτx,x′ u where τx,x′ ∈ T α
and u ∈ (Gα )r−1   r   are uniquely determined.

Lemma 1.7. We fix an order on Φ+ . For any z ∈ Ṽr , β ∈ Φ+ , define xzβ ∈
               Q
Gβr by z = β∈Φ+ xzβ (factors written using the given order on Φ+ ). Let α ∈
Φ− , a ∈ [1, r − 1]. Let z ∈ Ṽra be such that xzβ ∈ (Gβ )a+1
                                                          r   for all β ∈ Φ+ with
ht(β) > ht(α−1 ). Let ξ ∈ (Gα )r−a−1
                                 r    . Then ξz = zξτξ,z ωξ,z where τξ,z ∈ T α and
ωξ,z ∈ Ũrr−1 .

   We argue by induction on Nz = ♯(β ∈ Φ+ ; xzβ 6= 1). If Nz = 0 the result is
clear. Assume now that Nz = 1 so that z ∈ Gβr with β ∈ Φ+ . If αβ = 1, the
result follows from 1.6(c). If αβ 6= 1 and ht(β) > ht(α−1 ) then z ∈ (Gβ )a+1       r
and ξz = zξ by 1.6(b). If αβ 6= 1 and ht(β) ≤ ht(α−1 ) then by 1.6(b) we have
                        Q                                      i i′
ξz = zξu where u = i,i′ ≥1;αi β i′ ∈Φ ui,i′ with ui,i′ ∈ (Gα β )r−1 r ; it is enough to
                                             ′                 ′
show that if i, i′ ≥ 1, we cannot have αi β i ∈ Φ+ . (If αi β i ∈ Φ+ for some i, i′ ≥ 1
then αβ ∈ Φ+ hence ht(β) > ht(α−1 ), contradiction.)
   Assume now that Nz ≥ 2. We can write z = z ′ z ′′ where z ′ , z ′′ ∈ Ṽra , Nz ′ <
Nz , Nz ′′ < Nz . Using the induction hypothesis we have

                                     ξz = ξz ′ z ′′ = z ′ ξτξ,z ′ ωξ,z ′ z ′′

where τξ,z ′ ∈ T α , ωξ,z ′ ∈ Ũrr−1 . We have ωξ,z ′ z ′′ = z ′′ ωξ,z ′ and τξ,z ′ z ′′ = z ′′ τξ,z ′ .
Using again the induction hypothesis, we have

                   z ′ ξτξ,z ′ ωξ,z ′ z ′′ = z ′ ξτξ,z ′ z ′′ ωξ,z ′ = z ′ ξz ′′ τξ,z ′ ωξ,z ′
                    = z ′ z ′′ ξτξ,z ′′ ωξ,z ′′ τξ,z ′ ωξ,z ′ = zξτξ,z ′ τξ,z ′′ ωξ,z ′ ωξ,z ′′ .

Thus, ξz = zξτξ,z ωξ,z where

                                τξ,z = τξ,z ′ τξ,z ′′ , ωξ,z = ωξ,z ′ ωξ,z ′′ .

The lemma is proved.

1.8. In the setup of 1.6, let Z = V ∩ Ṽ . Let Φ′ = {β ∈ Φ; Gβ ⊂ Z}. We have
Φ′ ⊂ Φ+ . Let X be the set of all subsets I ⊂ Φ′ such that I 6= ∅ and ht : Φ+ −    →N
is constant on I.
    To any z ∈ Zr1 − {1} we associate a pair (a, Iz ) where a ∈ [1, r − 1] and Iz ∈ X
as follows. We define a by the condition that z ∈ Zra,∗ . If xzβ ∈ Gβ are defined as
in 1.8 in terms of a fixed order on Φ+ , then xzβ ∈ (Gβ )ar for all β ∈ Φ̃ and xzβ = 1
                                                                               ′
for all β ∈ Φ+ − Φ̃. Let Iz be the set of all α′ ∈ Φ̃ such that xzα′ ∈ (Gα )a,∗  r  and
  z       β a+1                +                           ′
xβ ∈ (G )r        for all β ∈ Φ such that ht(β) > ht(α ). It is easy to see, using
1.6(a),(b), that the definition of Iz does not depend on the choice of an order on
Φ+ . For a ∈ [1, r − 1] and I ∈ X let Zra,∗,I be the set of all z ∈ Zr1 − {1} such that
z ∈ Zra,∗ , I = Iz . Thus we have a partition
(a)                              Zr1 − {1} = ⊔a∈[1,r−1],I∈X Zra,∗,I .

Lemma 1.9. Let T, T ′ , U, U ′ , r, T , T ′ be as in 1.2. LetPθ ∈ TcF   ′   d′F
                                                                   r , θ ∈ Tr . Assume
that θ ′ |T F = χ is regular. Let Σ be as in 1.2. Then j∈Z (−1)j dim Hcj (Σ)θ−1 ,θ′
is equal to the number of w ∈ W (T, T ′ )F such that Ad(ẇ) : Tr′ F −     → TrF carries θ
    ′
to θ .
   Using the partition Σ = ⊔w∈W (T,T ′ ) Σw we see that it is enough to prove that
P          j        j                                                     ′F
  j∈Z (−1) dim Hc (Σw )θ−1 ,θ′ is equal to 1 if F (w) = w and Ad(ẇ) : Tr    → TrF
                                                                             −
carries θ to θ ′ and equals 0, otherwise. We now fix w ∈ W (T, T ′ ). We have
Σw
= {(x, x′ , y) ∈ F (Ur ) × F (Ur′ ) × Gr ; xF (y) = yx′ , y ∈ Ur G1r ẇTr′ Ur′ = Ur Zr1 ẇTr′ Ur′ }
where Z = V ∩ ẇV ′ ẇ−1 . Here V (resp. V ′ ) is the unipotent radical of a Borel
subgroup containing T (resp. T ′ ) such that U ∩ V = {1} (resp. U ′ ∩ V ′ = {1}.
Let
            Σ̂w = {(x, x′ , u, u′ , z, τ ′ ) ∈ F (Ur ) × F (Ur′ ) × Ur × Ur′ × Zr1 × Tr′ ;
            xF (u)F (z)F (ẇ)F (τ ′ )F (u′ ) = uz ẇτ ′ u′ x′ }.
The map Σ̂w −      → Σw given by (x, x′ , u, u′ , z, τ ′ ) 7→ (x, x′ , uz ẇτ ′ u′ ) is a locally trivial
fibration with all fibres isomorphic to a fixed affine space. This map is compatible
with the TrF × Tr′ F -actions where TrF × Tr′ F acts on Σ̂w by
(a)
   (t, t′ ) : (x, x′ , u, u′ , z, τ ′ ) 7→ (txt−1 , t′ x′ t′−1 , tut−1 , t′ u′ t′−1 , tzt−1 , ẇ−1 tẇτ t′−1 ).
Hence
   P it is enough    to show that
               j       j                                                        ′F
      j∈Z (−1)   dim H c (Σ̂w )θ−1 ,θ′ is equal to 1 if F (w) = w and Ad(ẇ) : Tr −→ TrF
carries θ to θ ′ and equals 0, otherwise.
By the change of variable xF (u) 7→ x, x′ F (u′ )−1 7→ x′ we may rewrite Σ̂w as
            Σ̂w = {(x, x′ , u, u′ , z, τ ′ ) ∈ F (Ur ) × F (Ur′ ) × Ur × Ur′ × Zr1 × Tr′ ;
            xF (z)F (ẇ)F (τ ′ ) = uz ẇτ ′ u′ x′ }

with the TrF × Tr′ F -action still given by (a). We have a partition Σ̂w = Σ̂′w ⊔ Σ̂′′w
where

      Σ̂′w = {(x, x′ , u, u′ , z, τ ′ ) ∈ F (Ur ) × F (Ur′ ) × Ur × Ur′ × (Zr1 − {1}) × Tr′ ;
      xF (z)F (ẇ)F (τ ′ ) = uz ẇτ ′ u′ x′ },


          Σ̂′′w = {(x, x′ , u, u′ , 1, τ ′ ) ∈ F (Ur ) × F (Ur′ ) × Ur × Ur′ × {1} × Tr′ ;
          xF (ẇ)F (τ ′ ) = uẇτ ′ u′ x′ },

are stable under the TrF × Tr′ F -action. It is then enough to show that
       P
   (b) j∈Z (−1)j dim Hcj (Σ̂′′w )θ−1 ,θ′ is equal to 1 if F (w) = w and Ad(ẇ) : Tr′ F −
                                                                                       →
  F                  ′
Tr carries θ to θ and equals 0, otherwise.
   (c) Hcj (Σ̂′w )θ−1 ,θ′ = 0 for all j.
We first prove (c). If M is a T ′F -module we shall write M(χ) for the subspace of
M on which T ′F acts according to χ. Now T ′F acts on Σ̂′w by

                t′ : (x, x′ , u, u′ , z, τ ′ ) 7→ (x, t′ x′ t′−1 , u, t′ u′ t′−1 , z, τ ′ t′−1 ).

Hence Hcj (Σ̂′w ) becomes a T ′F -module. It is enough to show that Hcj (Σ̂′w )(χ) = 0.
   We shall use the definitions and results in 1.6-1.8 relative to U, Ũ , V, Ṽ where
Ũ = ẇU ′ ẇ−1 , Ṽ = ẇV ′ ẇ−1 . The partition 1.8(a) gives rise to a partition Σ̂′w =
⊔a,I Σ̂a,I
       w indexed by a ∈ [0, r − 1], I ∈ X where

                                    ′      ′      ′      ′
                        Σ̂a,I                                     a,∗,I
                          w = {(x, x , u, u , z, τ ) ∈ Σ̂w ; z ∈ Zr     }.

It is easy to see that there is a total order on the set of indices (a, I) such that the
                                                                         0 0
union of the Σ̂a,I
                 w for (a, I) less than or equal than some given (a , I ) is closed
      ′                       a,I                                    ′F
in Σ̂w . Since the subsets Σ̂w are stable under the action of T , we see that, in
order to prove (c), it is enough to show that

(d)                                         Hcj (Σ̂a,I
                                                   w )(χ) = 0

for any fixed a, I as above. We choose α′ ∈ I. Let α = α′−1 . Then Gα
                                                                    r ⊂
         ′ −1
Ur ∩ ẇUr ẇ .
   For any z ∈ Zra,∗ , ξ ∈ (Gα )r−a−1
                                r     we have

                                             ξz = zξτξ,z ωξ,z

where τξ,z ∈ T α , ω(ξ, z) ∈ ẇUr′ r−1 ẇ−1 are uniquely determined. (See 1.7.) More-
over, the map (Gα )r−a−1
                     r      → T α , ξ 7→ τ (ξ, z) factors through an isomorphism

Let π : (Gα )r−a−1

                                       r   be the canonical homomorphism. We

This is a closed subgroup of T ′ . For any t′ ∈ H′ we define ft′ : Σ̂a,I
                                                                     w − → Σ̂a,I

            ft′ (x, x′ , u, u′ , z, τ ′ ) = (xF (ξ), x̂′ , u, F (t′ )−1 u′ F (t′ ), z, τ ′ F (t′ ))

where
               ξ = ψλ−1       ′ −1 ′ −1
                     z (ẇF (t )  t ẇ ) ∈ (Gα )r−a−1

and x̂′ ∈ Gr is defined by the condition that

              xF (ξ)F (z)F (ẇ)F (τ ′ F (t′ )) = uz ẇτ ′ F (t′ )F (t′ )−1 u′ F (t′ )x̂′ .

In order for this to be well defined we must check that x̂′ ∈ F (Ur′ ). Thus we must
show that
   xF (ξ)F (z)F (ẇ)F (τ ′ F (t′ )) ∈ uz ẇτ ′ u′ F (t′ )F (Ur′ )
or that
   xF (z)F (ξ)F (τξ,z )F (ωξ,z )F (ẇ)F (τ ′ F (t′ )) ∈ uz ẇτ ′ u′ F (t′ )F (Ur′ ).
Since xF (z) = uz ẇτ ′ u′ x′ F (τ ′ )−1 F (ẇ−1 ), it is enough to show that

            uz ẇτ ′ u′ x′ F (τ ′ )−1 F (ẇ−1 )F (ξ)F (τξ,z )F (ωξ,z )F (ẇ)F (τ ′ F (t′ ))

or that

Since x′ ∈ F (Ur′ ), F (ẇ−1 )F (ωξ,z )F (ẇ) ∈ F (Ur′ ), it is enough to check that
   F (τ ′ )−1 F (ẇ−1 )F (ξ)F (τξ,z )F (ẇ)F (τ ′ F (t′ )) ∈ F (t′ )F (Ur′ ).
Since F (ẇ−1 )F (ξ)F (ẇ) ∈ F (Ur′ ) it is enough to check that

or that
   F (ẇ−1 )F (τξ,z )F (ẇ)F (F (t′ )) = F (t′ )
or that ẇ−1 τξ,z ẇ = F (t′ )−1 t′ or that λz (πz (ξ)) = ẇF (t′ )−1 t′ ẇ−1 . But this is

Now T ′F ⊂ H′ and for t′ ∈ T ′F , the map ft′ coincides with the action of t′ in the

of H hence is contained in H . If t ∈ (ẇ−1 T α ẇ)F then NFF (t′ ) ∈ T ′F ; thus,
      ′                          ′0      ′
    n                                                         n
NFF (t′ ) ∈ T ′F ∩ H′0 . We see that the action of NFF (t′ ) ∈ T ′F on Hcj (Σ̂a,I    w ) is
                 ′      −1 α     Fn
trivial for any t ∈ (ẇ T ẇ) .
                                                            ′      Fn ′
   If we assume that Hcj (Σ̂a,I
                              w )(χ) 6= 0, it follows that t 7→ χ(NF (t )) is the trivial
                            n
character of (ẇ−1 T α ẇ)F . This contradicts our assumption that χ is regular.
Thus, (d) holds. Hence (c) holds.
   We now prove (b). Let

               H̃ = {(t, t′ ) ∈ Tr × Tr′ ; tF (t)−1 = F (ẇ)t′ F (t′ )−1 F (ẇ−1 )}.

This is a closed subgroup of Tr × Tr′ containing TrF × Tr′ F . Now the action of
TrF × Tr′ F on Σ̂′′w extends to an action of H̃ given by the same formula. To see this
consider (t, t′ ) ∈ H̃ and (x, x′ , u, u′ , 1, τ ′ ) ∈ Σ̂′′w . We must show that
    (txt−1 , t′ x′ t′−1 , tut−1 , t′ u′ t′−1 , 1, ẇ−1 tẇτ ′ t′−1 ) ∈ Σ̂′′w
that is,
    txt−1 F (ẇ)F (ẇ−1 )F (t)F (ẇ)F (τ ′ )F (t′−1 ) = tut−1 ẇẇ−1 tẇτ ′ t′−1 t′ u′ t′−1 t′ x′ t′−1
or that
    xt−1 F (t)F (ẇ)F (τ ′ )F (t′−1 ) = uẇτ ′ u′ x′ t′−1
or that xt−1 F (t)F (ẇ)F (τ ′ )F (t′−1 ) = xF (ẇ)F (τ ′ )t′−1
or that t−1 F (t)F (ẇ)F (t′−1 ) = F (ẇ)t′−1 ; this is clear. Let T∗ , T∗′ be the reductive
part of Tr , Tr′ (thus T∗ is a torus isomorphic to T ). Let H̃∗ = H̃ ∩ (T∗ × T∗′ ). Then
H̃∗0 is a torus acting on Σ̂′′w by restriction of the H̃-action. The fixed point set
          0
(Σ̂′′w )H̃∗ of the H̃∗0 -action is stable under the action of TrF × Tr′ F and by general
principles we have
             X                                         X                            0
                  (−1)j dim Hcj (Σ̂′′w )θ−1 ,θ′ =          (−1)j dim Hcj ((Σ̂′′w )H̃∗ )θ−1 ,θ′ .
            j∈Z                                  j∈Z

It is then enough to show that
        P                                    0
    (e) j∈Z (−1)j dim Hcj ((Σ̂′′w )H̃∗ )θ−1 ,θ′ is equal to 1 if F (w) = w and Ad(ẇ) :
Tr′ F −
      → TrF carries θ to θ ′ and equals 0, otherwise.
                                        0
Let (x, x′ , u, u′ , 1, τ ) ∈ (Σ̂′′w )H̃∗ . By Lang’s theorem the first projection H̃∗ −  → T∗
is surjective. It follows that the first projection H̃∗0 −       → T∗ is surjective. Similarly
the second projection H̃∗0 −       → T∗′ is surjective. Hence for any t ∈ T∗ , t′ ∈ T∗′ we have
    txt−1 = x, t′ x′ t′−1 = x′ , tut−1 = u, t′ u′ t′−1 = u′
                                                        0
hence x = x′ = u = u′ = 1. Thus, (Σ̂′′w )H̃∗ is contained in
    (f) {(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, τ ′); τ ′ ∈ Tr′ , F (ẇτ ′ ) = ẇτ ′ }.
The set (f) is clearly contained in the fixed point set of H̃. Note that (f) is empty
10                                           G. LUSZTIG

unless F (w) = w. We can therefore assume that F (w) = w. In this case, (f)
is stable under the action of H̃. In particular it is stable under the action of
H̃∗0 . Since (f) is finite and H̃∗0 is connected, we see that H̃∗0 must act trivially on
(f). Thus, (f) is exactly the fixed point set of H̃∗0 . Hence this fixed point can be
identified with (ẇTr′ )F . From this (e) follows easily. The lemma is proved.

                                   2. The main results
2.1. Let G, F be as in 1.2. Let T be an F -stable maximal torus in G and let
U be the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup of G that contains T . (Note
that U is not necessarily F -stable.) Let r ≥ 1. Let R(GF      r ) be the group of
virtual representations of GF

R(Gr ) × R(Gr ) − → Z. Let

                           ST,U = {g ∈ Gr ; g −1 F (g) ∈ F (Ur )}.
                                                                 −1
The finite group GF       F
                    r × Tr acts on ST,U by (g1 , t) : g 7→ g1 gt    . For any i ∈ Z
we have an induced action of GF        F      i                   cF
                                 r × Tr on Hc (ST,U ). For θ ∈ Tr , we denote by
 i                           i                   F
Hc (ST,U )θ the subspace of Hc (ST,U ) on which Tr acts according to θ. This is a
GF                   i
 r -submodule of Hc (ST,U ). Let

Proposition 2.2. Assume that r ≥ 2. Let (T ′ , U ′ , θ ′ ) be another triple like T, U, θ.
Let T = Trr−1 , T ′ = Tr′ r−1 .

There exists n ≥ 1 and g ∈ N (T ′ , T )F such that Ad(g) carries θ◦NFF |T F n ∈ Td

   We prove (a). Consider the free GF
                                    r −action on ST,U × ST ′ ,U ′ given by g1 :
     ′               ′
(g, g ) 7→ (g1 g, g1g ). The map

             (g, g ′) 7→ (x, x′ , y), x = g −1 F (g), x′ = g ′−1 F (g ′ ), y = g −1 g ′

defines an isomorphism of GF  r \(ST,U × ST ′ ,U ′ ) onto Σ (as in 1.2).
   The action of Tr × Tr on ST,U × ST ′ ,U ′ given by right multiplication by t−1
                     F     ′F

on the first factor and by t′−1 on the second factor becomes an action of TrF × Tr′ F
on Σ given by (x, x′ , y) 7→ (txt−1 , t′ x′ t′−1 , tyt′−1 ). Our assumption implies that

the GF            i                i
     r -module Hc (ST,U )θ−1 ⊗ Hc (ST ′ ,U ′ )θ′ contains the unit representation with
                                                      ′
non-zero multiplicity. Hence the subspace of Hci+i (GF   r \(ST,U × ST ′ ,U ′ )) on which
                                                                         ′

We now use Lemma 1.4; (a) follows.
   We prove (b). By general principles we have
                 X                               X
                     (−1)i (Hci (ST,U )θ−1 )∗ =     (−1)i Hci (ST,U )θ .
                             i                                 i

Hence the assumption of (b) implies that the assumption of (a) holds. Hence the
conclusion of (a) holds. The proposition is proved.
Proposition 2.3. We preserve the setup of 2.2. Assume that θ or θ ′ is regular.
                                  ′
The inner product hRTθ r ,Ur , RTθ r′ ,Ur′ i is equal to the number of w ∈ W (T, T ′ )F such
that Ad(ẇ) : Tr′ F −
                    → TrF carries θ to θ ′ .
   We may assume that θ ′ is regular. As in the proof of 2.2, we have

where ()Gr denotes the space of GF
                                 r -invariants. It remains to use 1.9.

Corollary 2.4. Assume that r ≥ 2. Let T, U be as in 2.1. Assume that θ ∈ Tc         F
                                                                                    r
is regular.
   (a) RTθ r ,Ur is independent of the choice of U .
   (b) Assume also that the stabilizer of θ in W (T, T )F is {1}. Then RTθ r ,Ur is ±
an irreducible GF   r -module.

   We prove (a). Let U ′ be the unipotent radical of another Borel subgroup of G
containing T . Let R = RTθ r ,Ur , R′ = RTθ r ,Ur′ . By 2.3 we have
  hR, Ri = hR, R′ i = hR′ , Ri = hR′ , R′ i.
Hence hR − R′ , R − R′ i = 0, so that R = R′ . This proves (a). In the setup of (b),
we see from 2.3 that hRTθ r ,Ur , RTθ r ,Ur i = 1. This proves (b).

2.5. Assume that r ≥ 2. Let T be as in 2.1. Assume that θ ∈ Tc    F
                                                                  r is regular. We
set
   RTθ r = RTθ r ,Ur
where U is chosen as in 2.1. (By 2.4(a), this is independent of the choice of U .)

                                  3. An example
3.1. Let A = F[[ǫ]]/(ǫ2 ). Define F : A −       → A by F (a0 + ǫa1 ) = aq0 + ǫaq1 where
a0 , a1 ∈ F. Let V be a 2-dimensional F-vector space with a fixed Fq -rational
structure with Frobenius map F : V −       → V . Let G = SL(V ). Then G has an Fq -
rational structure with Frobenius map F : G −          → G such that F (gv) = F (g)F (v)
for all g ∈ G, v ∈ V . Let V2 = A ⊗F V . Then G2 (see 0.2) may be identified
with the group of all automorphisms of the free A-module V2 with determinant 1.
We regard V as a subset of V2 by v 7→ 1 ⊗ v. Any element of V2 can be written
uniquely in the form v0 + ǫv1 where v0 , v1 ∈ V . The Frobenius map F : V2 −      → V2

3.2. Let B be the set of all A-submodules L ⊂ V2 such that L is a direct summand
of V2 and L is free of rank 1. Now G2 acts transitively on B. The diagonal action
on B × B has three orbits O, O′ , O′′ where
         REPRESENTATIONS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS OVER FINITE RINGS                                   13

    O = {(L, L′ ) ∈ B × B; L = L′ },
    O′ = {(L, L′ ) ∈ B × B; L ∩ L′ = ǫL = ǫL′ },
    O′′ = {(L, L′ ) ∈ B × B; L ∩ L′ = 0}.
If L ∈ B then F (L) ∈ B. Thus we obtain a map F : B −             → B, the Frobenius map of
a Fq -rational structure on B. Let
    X = {L ∈ B; (L, F (L)) ∈ O},
    X ′ = {L ∈ B; (L, F (L)) ∈ O′ },
    X ′′ = {L ∈ B; (L, F (L)) ∈ O′′ }.
Then X, X ′ , X ′′ form a partition of B into GF       2 -stable subvarieties.
    We now define some finite coverings of X, X ′ , X ′′ as follows. Let e, e′ be an F-
basis of V such that F (e) = e, F (e′ ) = e′ . Let T be the subgroup of G consisting
of the automorphisms e 7→ ae, e′ 7→ a−1 e′ with a ∈ F∗ . (An F -stable maximal
torus of G.) Let U be the subgroup of G consisting of the automorphisms
    e 7→ e + be′ , e′ 7→ e′ with b ∈ F∗ .
Let ν ∈ G be such that ν(e) = e′ , ν(e′ ) = −e. Let h ∈ G be such that he =
e, he′ = e′ + ǫe. Let
    X̃ = {g ∈ G2 ; g −1 F (g) ∈ U 2 }/U 2 ,
    X̃ ′ = {g ∈ G2 ; g −1 F (g) ∈ hU 2 }/(U 2 ∩ hU 2 h−1 ),
    X̃ ′′ = {g ∈ G2 ; g −1 F (g) ∈ νU 2 }.
(We use the action of U 2 or U 2 ∩ hU 2 h−1 on G2 by right translation.) Then
g 7→ Age′ is a well defined morphism X̃ −          → X, X̃ ′ −
                                                             → X ′ , X̃ ′′ −
                                                                           → X ′′ . This is a finite
                                              ′ ′′
principal covering with group Γ, Γ , Γ respectively (acting by right translation)
where
    Γ = TF   2 (of order q − q)
                                2

    Γ′ = {x ∈ T 2 U 2 ; x−1 hF (x) ∈ hU }/(U ∩ hU h−1 ) ∼      = {±1} × Fq (of order 2q if q
is odd, of order q if q is a power of 2)
    Γ′′ = {t ∈ T 2 ; F (t) = t−1 } (of order q 2 + q).
    For any variety Y with an action of a finite group and any character ω of
that finite group, let Hcj (Y )ω denote the subspace of Hcj (Y ) on which the fi-
nite group acts according to ω. Thus, for ω in Γ̂ (resp. Γ̂′ , Γ̂′′ ), Hcj (X̃)ω (resp.
Hcj (X̃ ′ )ω , Hcj (X̃ ′′ )ω ) is well defined.

3.3. Let Y = {g ∈ G; g −1 F (g) ∈ hU 2 }. We wish to describe Y more explicitly. If
g ∈ G2 , the condition that g ∈ Y is that
   F (g)e = ghue = gh(e + xe′ ) = g(e + xe′ + ǫxe),
   F (g)e′ = ghue′ = gh(e′ ) = g(e′ + ǫe)
for some x ∈ A. Define a, b, c, d ∈ A by ge = ae + be′ , ge′ = ce + de′ . The condition
that g ∈ Y is
   F (a)e + F (b)e′ = ae + be′ + ǫxae + ǫxbe′ + xce + xde′ ,
   F (c)e + F (d)e′ = ce + de′ + ǫae + ǫbe′
for some x ∈ A. Thus, we may identify Y with the set of all (a, b, c, d) ∈ A4 such
that
14                                               G. LUSZTIG

   F (a) = a+ǫxa+xc, F (b) = b+ǫxb+xd, F (c) = c+ǫa, F (d) = d+ǫb, ad−bc = 1
for some x ∈ A, or equivalently, such that
   (F (a) − a)(ǫb + d) = (F (b) − b)(ǫa + c), F (c) = c + ǫa, F (d) = d + ǫb, ad − bc = 1.
Setting a = a0 + ǫa1 , b = b0 + ǫb1 , c = c0 + ǫc1 , d = d0 + ǫd1 with ai , di ∈ F, we see
that Y is identified with the set consisting of all (a0 , b0 , c0 , d0 , a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 ) ∈ F8
such that
   (a) cq0 = c0 , dq0 = d0 , cq1 = c1 + a0 , dq1 = d1 + b0 ,
   (b) a0 d0 − b0 c0 = 1, a0 d1 + a1 d0 − b0 c1 − b1 c0 = 0,
   (c) (aq0 − a0 )d0 = (bq0 − b0 )c0 ,
   (aq0 − a0 )b0 + (aq0 − a0 )d1 + (aq1 − a1 )d0 = (bq0 − b0 )a0 + (bq0 − b0 )c1 + (bq1 − b1 )c0 .
Actually the equations (c) are a consequence of the other equations, hence they
can be omitted. The first equation (b) can be written (using (a)):
   (cq1 − c1 )d0 − (dq1 − d1 )c0 = 1,
that is,
   (c1 d0 − d1 c0 )q − (c1 d0 − d1 c0 ) = 1.
Setting f = c1 d0 − d1 c0 , we see that Y is identified with the set of all
   (a0 , b0 , c0 , d0 , a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 , f ) ∈ F9
such that
   cq0 = c0 , dq0 = d0 , cq1 = c1 + a0 , dq1 = d1 + b0 ,
   f q − f = 1, c1 d0 − d1 c0 = f, a0 d1 + a1 d0 − b0 c1 − b1 c0 = 0.
Now on Y we have a free right action of U 12 = U 2 ∩ hU 2 h−1 , u : g 7→ gu. In terms
of coordinates, this is (a, b, c, d) 7→ (a + ǫxc, b + ǫxd, c, d), x ∈ F or

     (a0 , b0 , c0 , d0 , a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 , f ) 7→ (a0 , b0 , c0 , d0 , a1 + xc0 , b1 + xd0 , c1 , d1 , f ).

The set of orbits Y /U 12 = X̃ ′ may be identified with the set of all
   (a0 , b0 , c0 , d0 , c1 , d1 , f ) ∈ F7
such that

      cq0 = c0 , dq0 = d0 , cq1 = c1 + a0 , dq1 = d1 + b0 , f q − f = 1, c1 d0 − d1 c0 = f.

We consider the obvious projection of this set to the finite set
    {(c0 , d0 , f ) ∈ F3 ; cq0 = c0 , dq0 = d0 , f q − f = 1, (c0 , d0 ) 6= (0, 0)}.
The fibre of this projection at (c0 , d0 , f ) ∈ F3 is the affine line {(c1 , d1 ) ∈ F2 ; c1 d0 −
d1 c0 = f }. Thus, X̃ ′ is a union of (q 2 − 1)q affine lines. Hence Hcj (X̃ ′ ) = 0 for
j 6= 2 and Hc2 (X̃ ′ ) is a permutation representation of GF                               2
                                                                          2 of dimension (q − 1)q.
                                                                    2     ′
For q odd, it follows easily that, as a GF          2 -module, Hc (X̃ ) is the direct sum of the
2q irreducible representations of degree (q 2 − 1)/2 (each one with multiplicity 1);
more precisely, for any ω ′ ∈ Γ̂′ , Hc2 (X̃ ′ )ω′ is irreducible of degree (q 2 − 1)/2 and
each irreducible representation of degree (q 2 − 1)/2 is obtained for exactly one ω ′ .
    Similarly, for q a power of 2, Hc2 (X̃ ′ ) is the direct sum of the q irreducible
representations of degree q 2 − 1 (each one with multiplicity 1); more precisely,
for any ω ′ ∈ Γ̂′ , Hc2 (X̃ ′ )ω′ is irreducible of degree q 2 − 1 and each irreducible
representation of degree q 2 − 1 is obtained for exactly one ω ′ .
        REPRESENTATIONS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS OVER FINITE RINGS                          15

                                                                             4    2
3.4. Now X̃ is a permutation representation of GF            2 of dimension q − q which
is easy to analyze. We see that Hcj (X̃) = 0 for j 6= 0 and, for q odd, Hc0 (X̃) is
the direct sum of all irreducible representations of degree q 2 + q and q + 1 (each
one with multiplicity 2), those of degree 1, q, (q + 1)/2 (each one with multiplicity
1) and Hc2 (X̃ ′ )ω′ with ω ′ ∈ Γ̂′ , ω ′2 = 1 (each one with multiplicity q − 1). More
precisely, if ω ∈ Γ̂ then Hc0 (X̃)ω is
   irreducible of degree q 2 + q if ω|T 12 F 6= 1;
   the direct sum of ⊕ω′ ∈Γ̂;ω′2 =1 Hc2 (X̃ ′ )ω′ with an irreducible representations of
degree q + 1, if ω|T 12 F = 1, ω 2 6= 1;
   the direct sum of ⊕ω′ ∈Γ̂;ω′2 =1 Hc2 (X̃ ′ )ω′ with the two irreducible representations
of degree (q + 1)/2, if ω|T 12 F = 1, ω 2 = 1, ω 6= 1;
   the direct sum of ⊕ω′ ∈Γ̂;ω′2 =1 Hc2 (X̃ ′ )ω′ with the two irreducible representations
of degree 1 and q, if ω = 1.
   On the other hand, for q a power of 2, Hc0 (X̃) is the direct sum of all irreducible
representations of degree q 2 + q and q + 1 (each one with multiplicity 2), those of
degree 1, q, (q 2 +q)/2 (each one with multiplicity 1) and Hc2 (X̃ ′ )1 (with multiplicity
q − 1). More precisely, if ω ∈ Γ̂ then Hc0 (X̃)ω is
   irreducible of degree q 2 + q if ω|T 12 F 6= 1, ω 2 6= 1;
   the direct sum of two irreducible representations of degree (q 2 + q)/2 if ω 2 =
1, ω 6= 1;
   the direct sum of Hc2 (X̃ ′ )1 with an irreducible representations of degree q + 1,
if ω|T 12 F = 1, ω 6= 1;
   the direct sum of Hc2 (X̃ ′ )1 with the two irreducible representations of degree 1
and q, if ω = 1.
3.5. Let

     S0 = {x0 ∈ V ; x0 ∧ F (x0 ) = e ∧ e′ },    S00 = {x0 ∈ S0 ; F 2 (x0 ) = −x0 }.

Now GF acts on S0 (restriction of the G-action on V ). This restricts to a GF -
action on S00 . We show that this action is simply transitive. If g ∈ GF keeps
fixed some x0 ∈ S00 then it also keeps fixed F (x0 ) hence it must be 1 (recall that
x0 , F (x0 ) form a basis of V ). Thus the GF -action on S00 has trivial isotropy. We
                                                        2         2
may identify S00 with {(a, b) ∈ F2 ; abq − aq b = 1, aq = −a, bq = −b}. For such
(a, b) we have automatically a 6= 0. We make a change of variable (a, b) 7→ (a, c)
where c = b/a. Then S00 becomes
                                        2        2
    {(a, c) ∈ F2 ; aq+1 (cq − c) = 1, aq = −a, cq = c}.
                                                    2
The second projection maps this to {c ∈ F; cq = c, cq 6= c} which has q 2 − q
elements. The fibre at c is {a ∈ F; aq+1 = (cq − c)−1 }. (For such a we have
                    2               2
automatically aq = −a since cq = c.) This fibre has exactly q + 1 elements since
(cq − c)−1 6= 0. We see that ♯(S00 ) = (q + 1)(q 2 − q) = ♯(GF ). It follows that the
GF -action on S00 is indeed simply transitive.

3.6. We now analyze X̃ ′′ . Let

                           S = {x ∈ V2 ; x ∧ F (x) = e ∧ e′ }.
                                                       ′
Now GF  2 acts on S by g1 : x 7→ g1 x. The map g 7→ g(e ) defines an isomorphism
             ∼
  ι : X̃ ′′ −→ S.
We check that this is a well defined bijection. Let g ∈ X̃ ′′ . Then F (g) = gνu for
some u ∈ U 2 . Let x = ge′ . Then for some u ∈ U 2 we have

     x ∧ F (x) = (ge′ ) ∧ F (ge′ ) = (ge′ ) ∧ F (g)e′ = e′ ∧ g −1 F (g)e′ = e′ ∧ νue′
      = e′ ∧ νe′ = e′ ∧ (−e) = e ∧ e′ ,

hence x ∈ S and ι is well defined. Now let x ∈ S. We can find g ∈ G2 such that
ge′ = x. Then

       e ∧ e′ = x ∧ F (x) = (ge′ ) ∧ F (ge′ ) = (ge′ ) ∧ F (g)e′ = e′ ∧ g −1 F (g)e′ .

Hence g −1 F (g)e′ = −e + be′ for some b ∈ A. It follows that g −1 F (g) = u′ νu
where u, u′ ∈ U 2 . Then (gu′ )−1 F (gu′ ) = νuF (u′ ) hence gu′ ∈ X̃ ′′ . Clearly,
ι(gu′ ) = x so that ι is surjective. Now assume that g, g ′ ∈ X̃ ′′ satisfy ι(g) = ι(g ′ )
that is ge′ = g ′ e′ . Then g ′ = gu′ , u′ ∈ U 2 . We have g ′−1 F (g ′ ) = νu with
u ∈ U 2 hence u′−1 g −1 F (g)F (u′ ) = νu. Also, g −1 F (g) = ν ũ with ũ ∈ U 2 hence
u′−1 ν ũF (u′ ) = νu so that u′ ∈ νU 2 ν −1 . Thus, u′ ∈ U 2 ∩ (νU 2 ν −1 ) = {1} hence
u′ = 1 and g ′ = g. Thus, ι is injective hence bijective. It commutes with the
GF2 -actions.
   Now S consists of the elements x0 + ǫx1 , with x0 , x1 ∈ V such that
   (x0 + ǫx1 ) ∧ (F (x0 ) + ǫF (x1 )) = e ∧ e′ ,
that is
   x0 ∧ F (x0 ) = e ∧ e′ and x1 ∧ F (x0 ) + x0 ∧ F (x1 ) = 0.
We have a morphism
   κ:S−    → S0 , x0 + ǫx1 7→ x0 .
If x0 ∈ S0 then κ−1 (x0 ) may be identified with
   {x1 ∈ V ; x1 ∧ F (x0 ) + x0 ∧ F (x1 ) = 0}.
Note that x0 , F (x0 ) form a basis of V hence F 2 (x0 ) = c0 x0 + c1 F (x0 ) with c0 , c1 ∈
F. Since x0 ∧ F (x0 ) = e ∧ e′ is F -stable, we have x0 ∧ F (x0 ) = F (x0 ) ∧ F 2 (x0 )
hence c0 = −1. Let S01 = S0 − S00 . We have a partition S = S∗ ∪ S∗∗ where
S∗ = κ−1 (S00 ), S∗∗ = κ−1 (S01 ) are GF      2 -stable. If x0 ∈ S0 , then any x1 ∈ V can
be written uniquely in the form
   x1 = a0 x0 + a1 F (x0 )
with a0 , a1 ∈ F. The condition that x0 + ǫx1 ∈ κ−1 (x0 ) is
   (a0 x0 + a1 F (x0 )) ∧ F (x0 ) + x0 ∧ (aq0 F (x0 ) + aq1 F 2 (x0 )) = 0,
that is,
   a0 x0 ∧ F (x0 ) + x0 ∧ (aq0 F (x0 ) − aq1 x0 + aq1 c1 F (x0 )) = 0,
that is,
         REPRESENTATIONS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS OVER FINITE RINGS                                17

    a0 x0 ∧ F (x0 ) + aq0 x0 ∧ F (x0 ) + aq1 c1 x0 ∧ F (x0 ) = 0,
    or a0 + aq0 + aq1 c1 = 0.
Thus we may identify κ−1 (x0 ) with {(a0 , a1 ) ∈ F2 ; a0 + aq0 + aq1 c1 = 0}. If c1 6= 0
(that is if x0 ∈ S01 ) this is isomorphic to the affine line. Thus, κ restricts to an
affine line bundle S∗∗ −         → S01 .
    Now the action of Γ on X̃ ′′ corresponds under ι to the action of {λ ∈ A; λF (λ) =
                               ′′

1} on S by scalar multiplication. Hence the action of {t ∈ Γ′′ ; t ∈ T21 } on X̃ ′′ cor-
responds to the action of A′ = {λ ∈ A; λF (λ) = 1, λ ∈ 1 + ǫA} on S by scalar
multiplication. The action of 1 + ǫλ1 ∈ A′ (with λ1 ∈ F) in the coordinates
(x0 , a0 , a1 ) is (x0 , a0 , a1 ) 7→ (x0 , a0 + λ1 , a1 ). Thus it preserves each fibre of κ.
    Now S∗∗ is stable under the action of {λ ∈ A; λF (λ) = 1} and the restriction
of this action to A′ preserves each fibre of S∗∗ −              → S01 (an affine line); hence
                                          j
this group acts trivially on Hc () of each such fibre hence it also acts trivially      P      on
Hcj (S∗∗ ). Thus, Hcj (S) −        → Hcj (S∗ ) is an isomorphism on the part where λ∈A′ λ
acts as 0.
    We now study Hcj (S∗ ). If x0 ∈ S00 then κ−1 (x0 ) may be identified with
{(a0 , a1 ) ∈ F2 ; a0 + aq0 = 0}. Thus, S∗ is an affine line bundle over
    S00 × {a0 ∈ F; a0 + aq0 = 0}
which is a transitive permutation representation of GF               2 that is explicitly known
from
P      3.5.     It follows    that   H j
                                       c (S ∗ ) = 0 for   j 6
                                                            = 2 and  the part of Hc2 (S∗ ) where
   λ∈A′ λ acts as 0 is the direct sum of the irreducible representations of degree
q − q (each one with multiplicity 2) and of degree (q 2 − q)/2 (each one with
 2

multiplicity 1); note that the latter representations occur only when q is a power
of 2.
    We now study the part of Hcj (S) where A′ acts as 1. This is the same as
Hc (A′ \S). The map (x0 , a0 , a1 ) 7→ (x0 , ã0 , a1 ), ã0 = a0 + aq0 is an isomorphism
   j

of A′ \S with the set of all (x0 , ã0 , a1 ) ∈ S0 × F × F such that ã0 + aq1 c1 = 0.
(Here c1 is determined by x0 as above.) Hence the map (x0 , a0 , a1 ) 7→ (x0 , a1 ) is
                                  ∼
an isomorphism A′ \S −→ S0 × F. Thus, Hcj (A′ \S) = Hcj−2 (S0 ). Thus, GF                  2 acts
       j    ′                                     F
on Hc (A \S) through its quotient G and that action is explicitly known from
the representation theory of GF .
    We see that Hc4 (X̃ ′′ ) is the 1 dimensional representation; Hc3 (X̃ ′′ ) is the direct
sum of all irreducible representations of degree q − 1 (each one with multiplicity
2) and those of degree (q − 1)/2, q (each one with multiplicity 1); Hc2 (X̃ ′′ ) is
the direct sum of all irreducible representations of degree q 2 − q (each one with
multiplicity 2) and of degree (q 2 −q)/2 (each one with multiplicity 1); Hcj (X̃ ′′ ) = 0
for j ∈/ {2, 3, 4}; note that the representations of degree (q − 1)/2 occur only for q
odd, while those of degree (q 2 − q)/2 occur only for q a power of 2.
    More precisely, if ω ∈ Γ̂′′ and q is odd, then
    Hc4 (X̃ ′′ )ω is irreducible of degree 1 if ω = 1 and is 0 otherwise;
    Hc3 (X̃ ′′ )ω is irreducible of degree q−1 if ω|Γ′′ ∩T21 = 1, ω 2 6= 1; it is the direct sum
of two irreducible representations of degree (q −1)/2 if ω|Γ′′ ∩T21 = 1, ω 2 = 1, ω 6= 1;
18                                           G. LUSZTIG

it it is irreducible of degree q if ω = 1; it is 0 if ω|Γ′′ ∩T21 6= 1;
    Hc2 (X̃ ′′ )ω is irreducible of degree q 2 − q if ω|Γ′′ ∩T21 6= 1 and is 0 otherwise.
    Similarly, if ω ∈ Γ̂′′ and q is a power of 2, then
    Hc4 (X̃ ′′ )ω is irreducible of degree 1 if ω = 1 and is 0 otherwise;
    Hc3 (X̃ ′′ )ω is irreducible of degree q − 1 if ω|Γ′′ ∩T21 = 1, ω 6= 1; it is irreducible
of degree q if ω = 1; it is 0 if ω|Γ′′ ∩T21 6= 1;
    Hc2 (X̃ ′′ )ω is irreducible of degree q 2 − q if ω|Γ′′ ∩T21 6= 1, ω 2 6= 1; it is the direct
sum of two irreducible representations of degree (q 2 − q)/2 if ω 2 = 1, ω 6= 1; it is
0 otherwise.
3.7. We see that any irreducible representation of GF             2 appears in at least one
of the representations Hcj (X̃)ω , Hcj (X̃ ′ )ω , Hcj (X̃ ′′ )ω . More precisely, the regular
representation of GF2 is a Q-linear combination of the virtual representations
               X                       X                          X
                   (−1)j Hcj (X̃)ω ,       (−1)j Hcj (X̃ ′ )ω ,       (−1)j Hcj (X̃ ′′ )ω .
               j∈Z                     j∈Z                        j∈Z


3.8. Let γ ∈ G be such that γ −1 F (γ) = ν. We set T = γT γ −1 , U = γU γ −1 .
Then T is an F -stable maximal torus of G and U is the unipotent radical of a
Borel subgroup of G containing T . Hence ST,U is defined (with r = 2). Now
g 7→ gγ −1 defines an isomorphism
          ∼
   X̃ ′′ −→ ST,U
                          ∼
and an isomorphism Γ′′ −→ T2F . Also GF      ′′         ′′
                                        2 × Γ acts on X̃ by (g1 , t) : g 7→ g1 gt
                                                                                  −1
                                                                                     .
                                     F     F
This action is compatible with the G2 × T2 -action on ST,U via the isomorphisms
                                                P
above. We see that the virtual representations j∈Z (−1)j Hcj (X̃ ′′ )ω of GF
                                                                           2 are the
                                      θ
same as the virtual representations RT,U .
3.9. We return to the general setup of 1.2. Let B be an F -stable Borel subgroup of
G with unipotent radical U . For any x ∈ Gr let Xx = {g ∈ Gr ; g −1 F (g) ∈ xU r }.
Then GF                                                                j
        r acts on Xx by left translations hence it acts naturally on Hc (Xx ). Note
that the isomorphism class of the GF            j
                                   r -module Hc (Xx ) depends only on the (U r , U r )
double cosetPof x in Gr . We conjecture that any irreducible representation of GF  r
appears in j∈Z (−1)j Hcj (Xx ) for some x ∈ Gr . This holds for r = 1 (see [DL])
and also for G = SL2 , r = 2, by the results in this section.
