                                                The preeminent example of the structure of vertex operator algebra (VOA) is
                                             the Moonshine VOA denoted V ♮ which was first constructed in [FLM88] and whose
                                             full automorphism group is the Monster sporadic group.
                                                Following [Höh96] we say that a VOA is nice when it is C2 -cofinite and satisfies
                                             a certain natural grading condition (see §2.1), and we make a similar definition for
                                             super vertex operator algebras (SVOAs). We say that a VOA is rational when all
                                             of its modules are completely reducible (see §2.2). Then conjecturally V ♮ may be
                                             characterized among nice rational VOAs by the following properties:
                                                  • self-dual
                                                  • rank 24
                                                  • no small elements
                                             where a self-dual VOA is one that has no non-trivial irreducible modules other
                                             than itself, and we write “no small elements” to mean no non-trivial vectors in the
                                             degree one subspace, since in a nice VOA this is the L(0)-homogeneous subspace
                                             with smallest degree that can be trivial. In this note we study what may be viewed
                                             as a super analogue of V ♮ . More specifically, we study an object Af ♮ characterized
                                             among nice rational N = 1 SVOAs by the following properties.
                                                  • self-dual
                                                  • rank 12
                                                  • no small elements
                                             An N = 1 SVOA is an SVOA which admits a representation of the Neveu–Schwarz
                                             superalgebra, and now “no small elements” means no non-trivial vectors with degree
                                             1/2. (We define an SVOA to be rational when its even sub-VOA is rational, and a
                                             self-dual SVOA is an SVOA with no irreducible modules other than itself.)

   We find that the full automorphism group of Af ♮ is Conway’s largest sporadic
group Co1 . Thus by considering the graded traces of elements of Aut(Af ♮ ) acting
on Af ♮ , that is, the McKay–Thompson series, one can associate modular functions
to the conjugacy classes of Co1 , and we obtain moonshine for Co1 . This is directly
analogous to the moonshine which exists for the Monster simple group, was first
observed in [CN79] and is to some extent explained by the existence of V ♮ .
   The main results of this paper are the following three theorems.
Theorem (4.5). The space Af ♮ admits a structure of self-dual rational N = 1
SVOA.
Theorem (4.11). The automorphism group of the N = 1 SVOA structure on Af ♮
is isomorphic to Conway’s largest sporadic group, Co1 .
Theorem (5.28). The N = 1 SVOA Af ♮ is characterized among nice rational
N = 1 SVOAs by the properties: self-dual, rank 12, trivial degree 1/2 subspace.
   The earliest evidence in the mathematical literature that there might be an
object such as Af ♮ was given in [FLM85] where it was suggested to study a Z/2-
orbifold of a certain SVOA VLf = AL ⊗ VL associated to the E8 lattice. Here L
is a lattice of E8 type, VL denotes the VOA associated to L, and AL denotes the
Clifford module SVOA associated to the space C ⊗Z L. Since the lattice L = E8 is
self-dual, VLf is a self-dual SVOA, and one finds that the graded character of VLf
satisfies
(1.0.1)
                          θE8 (τ )η(τ )8
    tr|V f q L(0)−c/24 =                  = q −1/2 (1 + 8q 1/2 + 276q + 2048q 3/2 + . . .)
        L                η(τ /2)8 η(2τ )8
and is a Hauptmodul for a certain genus zero subgroup of the Modular group Γ̄ =
PSL(2, Z). One can check that, but for the constant term, these coefficients exhibit
moonshine phenomena for Co1 . For example, we have that 276 is the dimension of
an irreducible module for Co1 , and 2048 = 1+276+1771 is a possible decomposition
of the degree 3/2 subspace into irreducibles for Co1 . The only problem being
that there is no irreducible representation of Co1 of dimension 8, and the space
corresponding to the constant term in the character of VLf would have to be a sum
of trivial modules were it a Co1 -module at all. As observed in [FLM85], orbifolding
VLf by a suitable lift of −1 on L, one obtains a space V f ♮ with tr|V f ♮ q L(0) =
tr|V f q L(0) − 8; that is, a space with the correct character for Co1 .
    L

                                  θE8 (τ )η(τ )8
(1.0.2) tr|V f ♮ q L(0)−c/24 =                    − 8 = q −1/2 (1 + 276q + 2048q 3/2 + . . .)
                                 η(τ /2)8 η(2τ )8
Also one finds that V f ♮ admits a reasonably transparent action by a group of the
shape 21+8 .(WE′ 8 /{±1}) which is the same as that of a certain involution centralizer
and maximal subgroup in Co1 . (Here WE′ 8 denotes the derived subgroup of the Weyl
group of type E8 .)
   We note here that the existence of V f ♮ has certainly been known to Richard E.
Borcherds for some time. Also, an action of Co1 on the SVOA underlying what we
will call Af ♮ was considered in [BR96].
   The space V f ♮ may be described as
(1.0.3)                              V f ♮ = (VLf )0 ⊕ (VLf )0θ
          SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                        3


where (VLf )θ denotes a θ-twisted VLf -module and θ = θf ⊗ θb is an involution on
VLf obtained by letting θf be the parity involution on AL , and letting θb be a lift to
Aut(VL ) of the −1 symmetry on L. The θ-twisted module (VLf )θ may be described
as a tensor product of twisted modules (VLf )θ = (AL )θf ⊗ (VL )θb , and (VLf )0 and
(VLf )0θ denote θ-fixed points. Now one is in a situation very similar to that which
gives rise to the Moonshine VOA V ♮ via the Leech lattice VOA as is carried out in
[FLM88], and one can hope that a similar approach as that used in [FLM88] would
yield the desired result: an SVOA structure on V f ♮ with an action by Co1 .
   We find it convenient to pursue a different approach. We construct an SVOA
Af ♮ whose graded character coincides with that of V f ♮ , and we do so using a purely
fermionic construction; that is, using Clifford module SVOAs. It turns out that this
fermionic construction enables one to analyze the symmetries in quite a transparent
way. We find that there is a specific vector in the degree 3/2 subspace of Af ♮ such
that the corresponding point stabilizer in the full group of SVOA automorphisms
of Af ♮ is precisely the group Co1 . Furthermore, this vector naturally gives rise to a
representation of the Neveu–Schwarz superalgebra on Af ♮ , and thus Co1 is realized
as the full group of automorphisms of a particular N = 1 SVOA structure on Af ♮ .
These results are presented in §4.
   In §5 we consider an analogue of the uniqueness conjecture for V ♮ . It turns out
that the N = 1 SVOA structure on Af ♮ is unique in the sense that the vectors
in (Af ♮ )3/2 that give rise to a representation of the Neveu–Schwarz superalgebra
on Af ♮ form a single orbit under the action of Spin24 (R) on Af ♮ . Making use of
modular invariance for n-point functions on a self-dual SVOA, due to [Zhu96] and
[Höh96], and utilizing also some ideas of [DM04b] and [DM04a], one can show that
the SVOA structure underlying Af ♮ is characterized up to some technical conditions
by the by now familiar properties:
     • self-dual
     • rank 12
     • no small elements
Combining these results, we find that Af ♮ is characterized among N = 1 SVOAs by
the above three properties. This uniqueness result accentuates the analogy between
V f ♮ and certain other celebrated algebraic structures: the Golay code, the Leech
lattice, and (conjecturally) the Moonshine VOA V ♮ .
   The homogeneous subspace of Af ♮ of degree 3/2 may be identified with a half-
spin module over Spin24 (R). The main idea behind the construction of Af ♮ is to
realize this spin module in such a way that the vector giving rise to the N = 1
structure on Af ♮ is as obvious as possible. Essentially, we achieve this by using
the Golay code to construct a particular idempotent in the Clifford algebra of a
24 dimensional vector space. The automorphism group of Af ♮ turns out to be
the quotient by center of the subgroup of Spin24 (R) fixing this idempotent. Thus a
curious corollary of the construction is that the group Co0 (the perfect double cover
of Co1 ) may be characterized as a point stabilizer in a spin module over Spin24 (R).
   The Golay code is characterized among length 24 doubly-even linear binary codes
(see §1.1) by the conditions of self-duality and having no “small elements” (that
is, no weight 4 codewords). The Golay code is an important ingredient in the
construction of Af ♮ , and these defining properties yield direct influence upon the
structure of Af ♮ . For example, the condition “no small elements” allows one to
4                                   JOHN F. DUNCAN


conclude that Aut(Af ♮ ) is finite, and the uniqueness of the Golay code ultimately
entails the uniqueness of the N = 1 structure on Af ♮ . The uniqueness of the N = 1
structure in turn allows one to formulate the following characterization of Co0 .
Theorem (5.29). Let M be a spin module for Spin24 (R) and let t ∈ M such that
hxt, ti = 0 whenever x ∈ Spin24 (R) is an involution with tr|24 x = 16. Then the
subgroup of Spin24 (R) fixing t is isomorphic to Co0 .
   It is perhaps interesting to note that the Leech lattice, which has automorphism
group Co0 and which furnishes a popular definition of this group [Con69], does not
figure directly in our construction of Af ♮ . Although the Golay code does play a
prominent role, the uniqueness of Af ♮ , or alternatively the above Theorem 5.29,
provide definitions for the group Co0 relying neither on the Leech lattice nor the
Golay code.
   The SVOA V f ♮ constructed from the E8 lattice admits a natural structure of
N = 1 SVOA in analogy with the way in which a usual lattice VOA is naturally
equipped with a Virasoro element. Thus a corollary of the uniqueness result for
Af ♮ is that Af ♮ is isomorphic to the N = 1 SVOA V f ♮ discussed above. In the
penultimate section §6 we consider the construction of V f ♮ in more detail, and we
indicate how to construct an explicit isomorphism with Af ♮ .
   In the final section §7 we consider the McKay–Thompson series associated to
elements of Co1 acting on Af ♮ . One can derive explicit expressions for each of
the McKay–Thompson series associated to elements of Co1 in terms of the frame
shapes of the corresponding preimages in Co0 . These expressions are recorded in
Theorem 7.1.

1.1. Notation. If M is a vector space over F and E is a field containing F, we
write E M = E ⊗F M for the vector space over E obtained by extension of scalars.
For the remainder we shall use F to denote either R or C. We choose a square root
of −1 in C and denote it by i. For q a prime power Fq shall denote a field with q
elements. For G a finite group we write FG for the group algebra of G over F.
   For Σ a finite set, we denote the power set of Σ by P(Σ). The set operation
of symmetric difference (which we denote by +) equips P(Σ) with a structure of
F2 -vector space, and with this structure in mind, we sometimes write FΣ          2 in place
of P(Σ). Suppose that Σ has N elements. The space FΣ             2   comes  equipped  with a
function w : FΣ2 →  {0,  1, . . . , N } called weight, which assigns   to an element γ ∈ FΣ2
the cardinality of the corresponding element of P(Σ). An F2 -subspace of FΣ             2 is
called a linear binary code of length N . A linear binary code C is called even if
2|w(C) for all C ∈ C, and is called doubly-even if 4|w(C) for all C ∈ C. For C < FΣ        2
a linear binary code, the co-code C ∗ is the space FΣ        2 /C. We write X 7→ X̄ for
                                   ∗                                                       ∗
the canonical map FΣ                                               Σ
                       2 → C . The weight function on F2 induces a function w
     ∗                                                   ∗
on C called co-weight, which assigns to X̄ ∈ C the minimum weight amongst all
preimages of X̄ in FΣ2 . Once a choice of code C has been made, it will be convenient
to regard w∗ as a function on FΣ                       ∗         ∗
                                       2 by setting w (X) := w (X̄) for X ∈ F2 .
                                                                                 Σ


   The Virasoro algebra is the universal central extension of the Lie algebra of
polynomial vector fields on the circle (see §2.5 for an algebraic formulation). In the
case that a vector space M admits an action
                                         ` by the Virasoro algebra, and the action
of L(0) is diagonalizable, we write M = n Mn where Mn = {v ∈ M | L(0)v = nv}.

We call Mn the homogeneous subspace of degree n, and we write deg(u) = n for
u ∈ Mn .
   When M is a super vector space, we write M = M0̄ ⊕ M1̄ for the superspace
decomposition. For u ∈ M we set |u| = k when u is Z/2-homogeneous and u ∈ Mk̄
for k ∈ {0, 1}. The dual space M ∗ has a natural superspace structure such that
Mγ∗ = (Mγ )∗ for γ ∈ {0̄, 1̄}.
   There are various vector spaces throughout the paper that admit an action by
a linear automorphism of order two denoted θ. Suppose that M is such a space.
Then we write M k for the θ-eigenspace with eigenvalue (−1)k . Note that M may
be a super vector space, and M = M 0 ⊕ M 1 may or may not coincide with the
superspace grading on M .
   We denote by Dz the operator on formalP       Laurent series which is formal differen-
tiation in the variable z, so that if f (z) =     fr z −r−1 ∈ V {z}
                                                                 P is a formal Laurent
series with coefficients in some space V , we have Dz f (z) = (−r)fr−1 z −r−1. For
                                (m)      1
m a positive integer, we set Dz = m!       Dzm .
   As is customary, we use η(τ ) to denote the Dedekind eta function.

Here q = e          and τ is a variable in the upper half plane h = {σ + it | t > 0}.
   We write Co1 for an abstract group isomorphic to Conway’s largest sporadic
group. We write Co0 for an abstract group isomorphic to the perfect double cover
of Co1 . It is well known that Co0 is isomorphic to the automorphism group of
the Leech lattice [Con69], and in particular, admits an orthogonal representation
of degree 24 writable over Z.

since this is the situation that will be relevant for the construction of Af ♮ .

                                 2. SVOA structure
2.1. SVOAs. Suppose that U = U0̄ ⊕ U1̄ is a super vector space over F. For an
SVOA structure on U we require the following data.
       • Vertex operators: a map U ⊗ U P       → U ((z)) denoted u ⊗ v 7→ Y (u, z)v such
         that, when we write Y (u, z)v = Z un vz −n−1 , we have un v ∈ Uγ+δ when
         u ∈ Uγ and v ∈ Uδ , and such that Y (u, z)v = 0 for all v ∈ U implies u = 0.
       • Vacuum: a distinguished vector 1 ∈ U0̄ such that Y (1, z)u = u for u ∈ U ,
         and Y (u, z)1|z=0 = u.
       • Conformal element: a distinguished vector ω ∈ U0̄ such that the operators
         L(n) = ωn+1 furnish a representation of the Virasoro algebra on U (c.f.
         §2.5).
This data furnishes an SVOA structure on U just when the following axioms are
satisfied.
    (1) Translation: for u ∈ U we have [L(−1), Y (u, z)] = Dz Y (u, z).
    (2) Jacobi Identity: the following Jacobi identity is satisfied for Z/2 homoge-
         neous u, v ∈ U .
                                      

                                              −z0
                                         
                                  z1 − z0
                      = z2−1 δ              Y (Y (u, z0 )v, z2 )
                                     z2
         when u ∈ Uγ and v ∈ Uδ .
    (3) L(0)-grading: the action of L(0) on U is diagonalizable with rational eigen-
         values bounded below, by −N say, and thus defines a Q>−N -grading U =
         `
           n Un on U . This grading is such that the L(0)-homogeneous subspaces
         Un = {u ∈ U | L(0)u = nu} are finite dimensional.
In the case that U = U0̄ we are speaking of ordinary VOAs.
   An SVOA U is said to be C2 -cofinite in the case that U−2 U = {u−2 v | u, v ∈ U }
has finite codimension in U . Following [Höh96] we say that an SVOA U is nice
when it is C2 -cofinite, the eigenvalues of L(0) are non-negative and contained in

2 Z,and the degree zero subspace U0 is one dimensional and spanned by the vacuum
vector. All the SVOAs we consider in this paper will be nice SVOAs.
   By definition the coefficients of Y (ω, z) define a representation of the Virasoro
algebra on U (c.f. §2.5). Let c ∈ C be such that the central element of the Virasoro
algebra acts as cId on U . Then c is called the rank of U , and we denote it by
rank(U ).
2.2. SVOA Modules. For an SVOA module over U we require a Z/2-graded
vector space M = M0̄ ⊕M1̄ and a map UP     ⊗M → M ((z)) denoted u⊗v 7→ Y M (u, z)v
                                                      −n−1
such that, when we write Y (u, z)v = Z uM
                             M
                                                 n vz        , we have uMn v ∈ Mγ+δ when
                                      M
u ∈ Uγ and v ∈ Mδ . The pair (M, Y ) is called an admissible U -module just when
the following axioms are satisfied.
    (1) Vacuum: the operator Y M (1, z) is the identity on M .
    (2) Jacobi Identity: for Z/2-homogeneous u, v ∈ U we have
                                 
                  −1     z1 − z2
                 z0 δ               Y M (u, z1 )Y M (v, z2 )
                            z0
                                               
                         |u||v| −1    z2 − z1
(2.2.1)           − (−1)       z0 δ               Y M (v, z2 )Y M (u, z1 )
                                        −z0
                                    
                      −1     z1 − z0
                  = z2 δ               Y M (Y (u, z0 )v, z2 )
                                z2
         where u ∈ Uγ , v ∈ Uδ .
    (3) Grading: The space M carries a 21 Z-grading M = r M (r) bounded from
                                                            `
         below such that un M (r) ⊂ M (m + r − n − 1) for u ∈ Um .
We say that an admissible U -module (M, Y M`   ) is an ordinary U -module if there is
some h ∈ C such that the 12 Z-grading M = r M (r) satisfies M (r) = {m ∈ M |
                                                                                 1
L(0)m = (r + h)m}, and the spaces M (r) are finite  ` dimensional for each r ∈ 2 Z.
In this case we set Mh+r = M (r) and write M = r Mh+r .
   All the SVOA modules that we consider will be ordinary modules. We under-
stand that unless otherwise qualified, the term module shall mean ordinary module.
Remark 2.1. The significance of the notion of admissible module is the result of
[DLM98] that if every admissible module over a VOA is completely reducible, then
there are finitely many irreducible admissible modules up to equivalence, and every
finitely generated admissible module is an ordinary module.
   A VOA is called rational if each of its admissible modules are completely re-
ducible. We define an SVOA to be rational if its even sub-VOA is rational. An
SVOA U is called simple if it is irreducible as a module over itself. We say that
a rational SVOA is self-dual if it is simple, and has no irreducible modules other
than itself.
2.3. Intertwiners. Let V be a VOA, and let (M i , Y i ), (M j , Y j ) and (M k , Y k )
be three V -modules. Suppose given a map M i ⊗ M j → M k {z}, and employ
the notation u ⊗ v 7→ Ykij (u, z)v =               −n−1
                                       P
                                         n∈Q un vz      . We assume that for any
         i            j
u ∈ M and v ∈ M we have un v = 0 for n sufficiently large, and we assume that
Ykij (u, z) = 0 only for u = 0. Then the map Ykij is called an intertwining operator
of type ikj just when the following axioms are satisfied.
             

       (1) Translation: for u ∈ M i we have Ykij (Li (−1)u, z) = Dz Ykij (u, z).

    (2) Jacobi Identity: for u ∈ V , v ∈ M i and w ∈ M j we have
                                       
                               z1 − z2

                                      z2

2.4. Twisted SVOA modules. Any SVOA U say, admits an order two involution
which is the identity on U0̄ and acts as −1 on U1̄ . We refer to this involution as
the canonical involution on U , and denote it by σ.
    For a structure of canonically twisted or σ-twisted U -module on a vector space M
P require
we            a map Y M : U ⊗ M → M ((z 1/2 )) such that when we write Y M (u, z) =
       M −n−1
   n un z        for Z/2-homogeneous u ∈ U , then uM   n = 0 unless u ∈ Uk̄ and n ∈
     k
Z+ 2 . The pair (M, Y M ) is called an admissible canonically twisted U -module when
it satisfies just the same axioms as for untwisted admissible U -modules except that
we modify the Jacobi identity axiom and the grading condition as follows.
      * Twisted Jacobi identity: For Z/2-homogeneous u, v ∈ U we require that

                              z2           z2
        when u ∈ Uk̄ .                                         `
      * Twisted grading: The space M carries a Z-grading M = r M (r) bounded
        from below such that un M (r) ⊂ M (m + r − n − 1) for u ∈ Um .
We say that an admissible canonically twisted U -module (M, Y M ) is an ordinary
canonically
`            twisted U -module if there is some h ∈ C such that the Z-grading M =
  r M  (r) satisfies M (r) = {m ∈ M | L(0)m = (r + h)m}, and the spaces M (r)
are finite
      `    dimensional   for each r ∈ Z. In this case we set Mh+r = M (r) and write
M = r Mh+r .
   As in §2.2, we convene that unless otherwise qualified, the term “canonically
twisted module” shall mean “ordinary canonically twisted module”.
   A canonically twisted module (M, Y M ) over an SVOA V is called σ-stable if it
admits an action by σ compatible with that on V , so that we have σY M (u, z)v =
Y M (σu, z)σv for u ∈ V , v ∈ M .
   An important result we will make use of is the following.
Theorem 2.2 ([DZ05]). If V is a self-dual rational C2 -cofinite SVOA then V has
a unique irreducible σ-stable σ-twisted module.
Remark 2.3. Recall from §2.2 that we define an SVOA to be rational in case it’s
even sub-VOA is rational. This is a stronger condition than the notion of rationality
in [DZ05], and an SVOA that is rational in our sense is both rational and σ-rational
in the sense of [DZ05].
          SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                           9


  For V satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 2.2 we will write (Vσ , Yσ ) for the
unique irreducible canonically twisted V -module this theorem guarantees.

2.5. N = 1 SVOAs. The Neveu–Schwarz superalgebra is the Lie superalgebra
spanned by the symbols Lm , Gm+1/2 , and c, for m ∈ Z, and subject to the following
relations [KW94].
                                                  m3 − m

(2.5.2)                Gm+1/2 , Ln = m + −             Gm+n+1/2 ,
                                             2     2
                                     	             m2 + m
(2.5.3)             Gm+1/2 , Gn−1/2 = 2Lm+n +              δm+n,0 c,
                                                    3
(2.5.4)                        [Lm , c] = Gm+1/2 , c = 0.
Note that this algebra is generated by the Gm+1/2 for m ∈ Z. The subalgebra
generated by the Ln is the Virasoro algebra.
   Suppose that U is an SVOA. We say that U is an N = 1 SVOA if there is an
element τ ∈ U3/2 such that the operators G(n+ 12 ) = τn+1 generate a representation
of the Neveu–Schwarz superalgebra on U . We refer to such an element τ as a
superconformal element for U . In general, a superconformal element for an SVOA
U is not unique and may not even exist, but for any superconformal τ we have
that 12 τ0 τ = 12 G(− 12 )τ is a conformal element. That is to say, the coefficients of
Y ( 12 G(− 21 )τ, z) generate a representation of the Virasoro algebra on U . Given an
SVOA U , we will always assume that any superconformal element for U is chosen
so that 12 G(− 12 )τ = ω.
   Note that the commutation relations for the Neveu–Schwarz superalgebra of cen-
tral charge c are equivalent to the following operator product expansions [DGH88].
                                            c/2         2Y (ω, z2 )    Dz2 Y (ω, z2 )
(2.5.5)         Y (ω, z1 )Y (ω, z2 ) ∼              +               +
                                        (z1 − z2 )4     (z1 − z2 )2      (z1 − z2 )
                                           3 Y (τ, z2 )     Dz2 Y (τ, z2 )
(2.5.6)            Y (ω, z1 )Y (τ, z2 ) ∼                 +
                                           2 (z1 − z2 )2      (z1 − z2 )
                                                2c/3        2Y (ω, z2 )
(2.5.7)              Y (τ, z1 )Y (τ, z2 ) ∼               +
                                             (z1 − z2 )3     (z1 − z2 )
Consequently, we have the following
Proposition 2.4. Suppose U is an SVOA with conformal element ω and central
charge c. Then τ ∈ (U )3/2 is a superconformal element for U so long as τ2 τ = 23 c1,
τ1 τ = 0 and τ0 τ = 2ω.
   Given an N = 1 SVOA U with superconformal element τ and conformal element
ω = 21 τ0 τ , we write AutSV OA (U ) for the group of automorphisms of the SVOA
structure on U , and we write Aut(U ) for group of automorphisms of the N = 1
SVOA structure on U . That is, for U an N = 1 SVOA, Aut(U ) denotes the
subgroup of AutSV OA (U ) comprised of automorphisms that fix τ .

2.6. Adjoint operators. Suppose that U is a nice SVOA. For M a module over
U , let M ′ denote the restricted dual of M , and let h· , ·iM be the natural pairing

M ′ × M → C. We define the adjoint vertex operators Y ′ : U ⊗ M ′ → M ′ {z} by
requiring that

for u ∈ Un−1/2 ⊕ Un with n ∈ Z, where w ∈ M and w ∈ M . As in [FHL93] we
have
Proposition 2.5. The map Y ′ equips M ′ with a structure of U -module.
    Let h·|·i : U ⊗ U → C be a bilinear form on U such that hUm | Un i ⊂ {0}
unless m = n. Then there is a unique grading preserving linear map ϕ : U → U ′
determined by the formula hϕ(u), viU = hu | vi, and ϕ is a U -module equivalence
if and only if
                                     D                                   E
(2.6.2)          hY (u, z)w1 | w2 i = w1 | Y (ezL(1) z −2L(0) u, z −1)w2
for all u, w1 and w2 in U . When this identity is satisfied we say that the bilinear
form h·|·i is an invariant form for U .
Proposition 2.6. Suppose that h·|·i is an invariant form for U . Then it is sym-
metric.
   Just as in the untwisted case, we can define the adjoint canonically twisted
vertex operators. For (M, Y ) a canonically twisted U module, we define operators
Y ′ : U ⊗ M ′ → M ′ {z} by requiring that
(2.6.3)         hY ′ (u, z)w′ , wiM = (−1)n hw′ , Y (ezL(1) z −2L(0) u, z −1 )wiM
for u ∈ Un−1/2 ⊕ Un with n ∈ Z, where w′ ∈ M ′ , w ∈ M , and h· , ·iM is the natural
pairing M ′ × M → C. As in the untwisted case, we have
Proposition 2.7. The map Y ′ equips M ′ with a structure of canonically twisted
U -module.
2.7. Lattice SVOAs. Let L be a positive definite integral lattice, and recall that
F denotes R or C. Then the following standard procedure associates to L, an SVOA
defined over F and we shall denote it by F VL . We refer the reader to [FLM88] for
more details.
   Let F h = F ⊗Z L and let F ĥ denote the Heisenberg Lie algebra described by
               a
(2.7.1) F ĥ =           n
                  F h ⊗ t ⊕ Fc,    [h(m), h′ (n)] = mhh, h′ iδm+n,0 , [h(m), c] = 0.
              n∈Z

We denote by F b̂ and F b̂′ , the (commutative) subalgebras of F ĥ given by
                       a                               a
                                       n            ′               n
(2.7.2)         F b̂ =          F h ⊗ t ⊕ Fc,   F b̂ =      Fh ⊗ t .
                      n∈Z≥0                                   n∈Z<0

Let L̂ be the unique up to equivalence extension of L by a group hκi with generator
κ of order two, such that the commutators in L̂ satisfy
(2.7.3)                       aba−1 b−1 = κhā,b̄i+hā,āihb̄,b̄i
where a 7→ ā denotes the natural homomorphism L̂ → L. We have the following
short exact sequence.

           SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                                  11


Let F{L} denote the L̂-module obtain by factoring FL̂ by the subalgebra generated
by κ + 1. We write ι(a) for the image of a ∈ L̂ in F{L} under the composition
of maps L̂ ֒→ FL̂ → F{L}. The space F{L} is again an algebra, and is linearly
isomorphic to FL. The algebra F{L} may be equipped with a structure of F b̂-
module as follows.
(2.7.5) h(m) · ι(a) = 0 for m > 0,            h(0) · ι(a) = hh, āiι(a),       c · ι(a) = ι(a).
As an F ĥ-module, F VL is defined to be that induced from the F b̂-module structure
on F{L}.
(2.7.6)                         F VL   = U (F ĥ) ⊗U(F b̂) F{L}
We identify F{L} with the subspace 1 ⊗ F{L} of F VL , and we set 1 = 1 ⊗ ι(1).
There is a natural isomorphism of F b̂′ -modules, F VL ≃ S(F b̂′ ) ⊗ F{L}.
   Now we define the vertex operators on F VL . Let h ∈ F h. We define generating
functions h(z) and l(h, z) of operators on F VL by
                      X                                X h(n)
(2.7.7)       h(z) =      h(n)z −n−1 ,     l(h, z) =                 z −n
                                                                −n
                        n∈Z                                      n∈Z, n6=0

Then for h ∈ F h and a ∈ L̂, the vertex operators associated to ι(a) = 1 ⊗ ι(a) and
h(−n − 1) = h(−n − 1) ⊗ ι(1) are given by
(2.7.8)     Y (h(−n − 1), z) = Dz(n) h(z),           Y (ι(a), z) =: exp (l(ā, z)) az ā(0) :
respectively, where the colons denote the Bosonic normal ordering: that all op-
erators h(m) with m ≥ 0 be commuted to the right of all other operators. The
remaining vertex operators are determined by the requirement that Y be a linear
map, and that
(2.7.9)            Y (u−1 v, z) =: Y (u, z)Y (v, z) :      for u, v ∈ F VL .
If {hi } is a basis for F h and {h′i } is the dual basis, let ω = 21    hi (−1)h′i (−1). Then
                                                                     P
ω is independent of the choice of basis, and we have the following
Theorem 2.8 ([FLM88]). The quadruple (F VL , Y, 1, ω) is an SVOA and the rank
of F VL coincides with the rank of L.
   We refer to F VL as the SVOA over F associated to L via the standard construc-
tion. The superspace decomposition of F VL is given by F VL = F VL0 ⊕ F VL1 where
L0 is the sublattice of L consisting of elements with even norm squared, and L1 is
the (unique) coset of L0 in L, consisting of elements with odd norm squared.
2.7.1. The involution θ for F VL . The lattice L admits a non-trivial involution that
acts by α 7→ −α for α ∈ L. This involution lifts naturally to automorphisms of F h
and F ĥ and hence to U (F ĥ). We denote it by θ. We may define an automorphism
of F{L} by
                                                            2
(2.7.10)                    ι(a) 7→ (−1)hā,āi/2+hā,āi       /2
                                                                     ι(a−1 )
for a ∈ L̂. We denote it also by θ. Recalling that F VL was constructed as
(2.7.11)                          F VL   = U (F ĥ) ⊗F b̂ F{L}
we may define an automorphism of F VL by θ ⊗ θ where the θ on the left is that
defined for the left tensor factor of F VL , and the one on the right is that just defined
12                                 JOHN F. DUNCAN


on the right tensor factor. Since all these automorphisms may be regarded as lifts
of −1, we denote θ ⊗ θ also by θ. Then θ is an automorphism of the VOA structure
on F VL , and we may refer to it as a lift to Aut(F VL ) of the −1 symmetry on L.
Remark 2.9. It is a result of [DGH98] that all lifts of −1 are conjugate under the
action of Aut(F VL ).
   The space F VL decomposes into eigenspaces for the action of θ, and we express
this decomposition as F VL = F VL0 ⊕ F VL1 where F VLk is the eigenspace with eigenvalue
(−1)k for the action of θ.
2.7.2. Real form for F VL . The adjoint operators on F VL determine an invariant
bilinear form, which is given by
(2.7.12)        hu | vi1 = Resz=0 z −1 (−1)n Y (ezL(1) z −2L(0) u, z −1 )v
when u is in (F VL )n−1/2 or (F VL )n for some n ∈ Z. Consider the case that F = R.
Then the form h· | ·i is not positive definite on R VL . In fact, the form is positive
definite on the subspace R VL0 , and is negative definite on R VL1 . Suppose now that
we view R VL as embedded in C VL curtesy of the the natural inclusion R ֒→ C. Let
us set VL to be the R subspace of C VL described by
(2.7.13)         VL = R VL0 ⊕ i R VL1 = {u + iv | u ∈ R VL0 , v ∈ R VL1 }
Then VL closes under the vertex operators Y associated to C VL , and the form h· | ·i
restricts to be positive definite on VL . From now on we write VL for the real VOA
with positive definite bilinear form obtained in this way, by restricting the form
and vertex operator algebra structure from C VL .

                               3. Clifford algebras
   The construction of SVOAs that we will use is based on the structure of Clifford
algebra modules. In this section we recall some basic properties of Clifford algebras
and we exhibit a construction of modules over finite dimensional Clifford algebras
using doubly-even linear binary codes (see §1.1). In §3.4 we recall the construction
of SVOA module structure on modules over certain infinite dimensional Clifford
algebras.
3.1. Clifford algebra structure. In this section F denotes either R or C. For u an
F-vector space with non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form h· , ·i we write Cliff(u)
for the Clifford algebra over F generated by u. More precisely, we set Cliff(u) =
T (u)/I(u) where T (u) is the tensor algebra of u over F with unit denoted 1, and I(u)
is the ideal of T (u) generated by all expressions of the form u ⊗ u + hu, ui1 for u ∈ u.
The natural algebra structure on T (u) induces an associative algebra structure on
Cliff(u). The vector space u embeds in Cliff(u), and when it is convenient we identify
u with its image in Cliff(u). We also write α in place of α1 + I(u) ∈ Cliff(u) for
α ∈ F when no confusion will arise. For u ∈ u we have the relation u2 = −|u|2 in
Cliff(u). Polarization of this identity yields uv + vu = −2hu, vi for u, v ∈ u.
    The linear transformation on u which is −1 times the identity map lifts naturally
to T (u) and preserves I(u), and hence induces an involution on Cliff(u) which we
denote by θ. The map θ is often referred to as the parity involution. We have
θ(u1 · · · uk ) = (−1)k u1 · · · uk for u1 · · · uk ∈ Cliff(u) with ui ∈ u, and we write
Cliff(u) = Cliff(u)0 ⊕ Cliff(u)1 for the decomposition into eigenspaces for θ. Define
a bilinear form on Cliff(u), denoted h· , ·i, by setting h1, 1i = 1, and requiring that
           SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                              13


for u ∈ u, the adjoint of left multiplication by u is left multiplication by −u. Then
the restriction of h· , ·i to u agrees with the original form on u.
(3.1.1)                   hu, ui = −h1, u2 i = −h1, −|u|2 1i = |u|2
More generally, the adjoint of u = u1 · · · uk for ui ∈ u is (−1)k uk · · · u1 . The
main anti-automorphism of Cliff(u) is the map we denote α, which acts by sending
u1 · · · uk to uk · · · u1 for ui ∈ u.
3.2. Spin groups. Let us write Cliff(u)× for the group of invertible elements in
Cliff(u). For x ∈ Cliff(u)× and a ∈ Cliff(u), we set x(a) = xax−1 . We will define
the Pinor and Spinor groups associated to u slightly differently according as u is real
or complex: in the case that u is real, we define the Pinor group Pin(u) to be the
subgroup of Cliff(u)× comprised of elements x such that x(u) ⊂ u and α(x)x = ±1;
in the case that u is complex we define Pin(u) to be the set of x ∈ Cliff(u)× such
that x(u) ⊂ u and α(x)x = 1. In both cases we define the Spinor group by setting
Spin(u) = Pin(u) ∩ Cliff(u)0 .
   Let x ∈ Pin(u). Then we have hx(u), x(v)i = hu, vi for u, v ∈ u, and thus the
map x 7→ x(·), which has kernel ±1, realizes the Pinor group as a double cover
of O(u). (If u ∈ u and hu, ui = 1, then u(·) is the orthogonal transformation of
u which is minus the reflection in the hyperplane orthogonal to u.) The image of
Spin(u) under the map x 7→ x(·) is just the group SO(u).
   In the case that u is real with definite bilinear form, we have α(x)x = 1 for all
x ∈ Spin(u), and the group Spin(u) is generated by the (well-defined) expressions
exp(λei ej ) ∈ Cliff(u)× for λ ∈ R and {ei } an orthonormal basis of u. The Spinor
group of the complexified space C u is then generated by the exp(λei ej ) for λ ∈ C.
3.3. Clifford algebra modules. For the remainder of this section we suppose
that u is a finite dimensional real vector space with positive definite symmetric
bilinear form, and also that E = {ei }i∈Σ is an orthonormal basis for u, indexed
by a finite set Σ. For S = (s1 , . . . , sk ) ∈ Σ×k , a k-tuple of elements from Σ for
any k, we write eS for the element es1 es2 · · · esk in Cliff(u). We suppose that Σ
is equipped with some ordering. If S = {s1 , . . . , sk } is a subset of Σ (that is, an
unordered subset), we denote by S       ~ the k-tuple given by S
                                                               ~ = (s1 , . . . , sk ) just when
s1 < · · · < sk , so that eS~ = es1 · · · esk . We then abuse notation to write eS for eS~ .
In this way we obtain an element eS in Cliff(u) for any S ⊂ Σ. (We set e∅ = 1.)
This correspondence depends on the choice of ordering, but our discussion will be
invariant with respect to this choice. Note that eS eR = ±eS+R for any S, R ⊂ Σ,
and the set {eS | S ⊂ Σ} furnishes an orthonormal basis for Cliff(u).
   We now obtain an FΣ       2 -grading on Cliff(u) by decreeing that for S ⊂ Σ, the
homogeneous subspace of Cliff(u) with degree S is just the F-span of the vector eS .
(3.3.1)
                 M
    Cliff(u) =         Cliff(u)S , Cliff(u)S = FeS , Cliff(u)S Cliff(u)R ⊂ Cliff(u)S+R .
                 S⊂Σ
Since this grading depends on the choice of orthonormal basis E, we will refer to it
as the FE2 -grading, and we refer to the homogeneous elements eS as FE2 -homogeneous
elements. A given subset of Cliff(u) is called FE2 -homogeneous if all of its elements
are FE2 -homogeneous.
   Suppose that E is an FE2 -homogeneous subgroup of Spin(u). Then E is a union
of elements of the form ±eC for C ⊂ Σ, and hence is finite, and has exponent four.
14                                JOHN F. DUNCAN


Furthermore, the set of C for which ±eC is in E determines a linear binary code on
Σ. For E an FE2 -homogeneous subgroup of Spin(u), we write C(E) for the associated
linear binary code on Σ. The following result is straightforward.
Proposition 3.1. Suppose that −1 ∈   / E and C(E) is a doubly-even code. Then the
map E → C(E) such that ±eS 7→ S is an isomorphism of abelian groups, and the
sub-algebra of Cliff(u) generated by E is naturally isomorphic to the group algebra
RE.
   Suppose now that E is an FE2 -homogeneous subgroup of Spin(u) such that −1 ∈  /
E and C(E) is a self-dual doubly-even code. (Note that this forces dim(u) to
be a multiple of eight.) Then we write CM(u)E for the Cliff(u)-module defined
by CM(u)E = Cliff(u) ⊗RE R1 where R1 denotes a trivial E-module. Let us set
1E = 1 ⊗ 1 ∈ CM(u)E . Then CM(u)E admits a bilinear form defined so that
h1E , 1E i = 1, and the adjoint to left multiplication by u ∈ u ֒→ Cliff(u) is left
multiplication by −u.
Proposition 3.2. The Cliff(u)-module CM(u)E is irreducible, and a vector-space
basis for CM(u)E is naturally indexed by the elements of the co-code C(E)∗ . The
bilinear form on CM(u)E is non-degenerate.
Proof. We have eS+C 1 = ±eS 1 for any S ⊂ Σ when C ∈ C(E). This shows that a
basis for CM(u)E is indexed by the elements of the co-code C(E)∗ = P(Σ)/C(E),
and it follows that the irreducible submodules of CM(u)E are indexed by the cosets
of C(E) in its dual code C(E)⊥ = {S ∈ P(Σ) | |S ∩ C| ≡ 0 (mod 2), ∀C ∈ C(E)}.
Since C(E) is self-dual, CM(u)E is irreducible.                                 
  Note that the vector 1E ∈ CM(u)E is such that g1E = 1E for all g ∈ E, and
CM(u)E is spanned by the a1E for a ∈ Cliff(u). We have the following
Proposition 3.3. Suppose that CM(u)0 is a non-trivial irreducible Cliff(u)-module
with a vector 10 such that g10 = 10 for all g ∈ E. Then CM(u)0 is equivalent to
CM(u)E , and a module equivalence is furnished by the map φ : CM(u)E → CM(u)0
defined so that φ(a1E ) = a10 for a ∈ Cliff(u).
Proof. Recall our assumption that C(E) is self-dual so that 2d = dim(u) is divisible
by eight, and |C(E)| = 2d . In this case we have that Cliff(u) is isomorphic to M2d (R)
so that there is a unique non-trivial irreducible Cliff(u)-module up to equivalence
and it has dimension 2d . It suffices then to show that φ is well defined, and this
follows from the universal mapping property of the induced module CM(u)E . 
   We will sometimes wish to replace u with its complexification C u in the above,
in which case we shall understand CM(C u)E to be the complexification C CM(u)E
of CM(u)E . Then CM(C u)E is an irreducible module over Cliff(C u).
3.4. Clifford module construction of SVOAs. Let u be a finite dimensional
vector space over R with positive definite symmetric bilinear form. In this section
we review the construction of SVOA structure on modules over certain infinite
dimensional Clifford algebras associated to u. The construction is quite standard
and one may refer to [FFR91] for example, for full details. Our setup is somewhat
different from that in [FFR91] in that we prefer to be able to work over R, and
we must therefore use an alternative construction of the canonically twisted SVOA
module, since a polarization of u does not exist in this case. On the other hand, all
            SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                                15


one requires is an irreducible module over the (finite dimensional) Clifford algebra
Cliff(u), and the arguments of [FFR91] then go through with only cosmetic changes.
    So that the reader can translate between this section and the exposition in
[FFR91], let us note that in [FFR91] they consider the case that a say, is a
complex vector space with non-degenerate bilinear form h· , ·i0 , and a polarization
a = a+ ⊕ a− such that a± is spanned by vectors a±                           ± ∓
                                                      i , which satisfy hai , aj i0 = δij .
They consider the Clifford algebra Cliff 0 (a) defined by Cliff 0 (a) = T (a)/I0 (a) where
I0 (a) is the ideal spanned by elements of the form uv +vu = hu, vi0 1. In this section
we take u to be a real vector space of even dimension with positive definite bilinear
form and orthonormal basis {ei }. Let d = dim(u)/2, and in the complexification
                ±     1
C u of u set aj = 2 (iej ∓ ej+d ). Then we have an identification of vector spaces
a = C u. We also have ha±         ∓       1                ± ∓               ± ∓
                             i , aj i = − 2 δij so that {ai , aj } = −2hai , aj i = δij
in Cliff(C u), and setting h· , ·i0 = −2h· , ·i we have an identification of algebras
Cliff 0 (a) = Cliff(C u).
   We now proceed with the construction. We assume that u admits an orthonormal
basis {ei }i∈Σ indexed by a finite set Σ. For simplicity we suppose that the dimension
of u is divisible by eight so that maximal self-orthogonal doubly-even codes on Σ
are self-dual. Let û and ûθ denote the infinite dimensional inner product spaces
described as follows.
                            a                         a
(3.4.1)                û =      u ⊗ tm+1/2 , ûθ =       u ⊗ tm ,
                               m∈Z                           m∈Z
                          r      s
(3.4.2)            hu ⊗ t , v ⊗ t i = hu, viδr+s,0 , for u, v ∈ u and r, s ∈ 12 Z.
We write u(r) for u ⊗ tr when u ∈ u and r ∈ 21 Z. We consider the Clifford algebras
Cliff(û) and Cliff(ûθ ). The inclusion of u in ûθ given by u 7→ u(0) induces an
embedding of algebras Cliff(u) ֒→ Cliff(ûθ ). For S = (i1 , . . . , ik ) an ordered subset
of Σ we write eS (r) for the element ei1 (r) · · · eik (r), which lies in Cliff(û) or Cliff(ûθ )
according as r is in Z + 21 or Z. With this notation eS (0) coincides with the image
of eS under the embedding Cliff(u) ֒→ Cliff(ûθ ). Let E be an FE2 -homogeneous
subgroup of Cliff(u)× such that C(E) is a self-dual doubly-even code on Σ.
   We write B(û) for the subalgebra of Cliff(û) generated by the u(m + 21 ) for
u ∈ u and m ∈ Z≥0 . We write B(ûθ )E for the subalgebra of Cliff(ûθ ) generated
by E ⊂ Cliff(u), and the u(m) for u ∈ u and m ∈ Z>0 . Let R1 denote a one-
dimensional module for either B(û) or B(ûθ )E , spanned by a vector 1E , such that
u(r)1E = 0 whenever r ∈ 21 Z>0 , and such that g(0)1E = 1E for g ∈ E. We write
A(u) (respectively A(u)θ,E ) for the Cliff(û)-module (respectively Cliff(ûθ )-module)
induced from the B(û)-module structure (respectively B(ûθ )E -module structure) on
R1 .
(3.4.3)         A(u) = Cliff(û) ⊗B(û) R1 ,          A(u)θ,E = Cliff(ûθ ) ⊗B(ûθ )E R1 .
We write 1 for 1 ⊗ 1E ∈ A(u), and we write 1θ for 1 ⊗ 1E ∈ A(u)θ,E . When no
confusion will arise, we simply write A(u)θ in place of A(u)θ,E .
   The space A(u) supports a structure of SVOA. In order to define the vertex
operators we require the notion of fermionic normal ordering for elements in Cliff(û)
and Cliff(ûθ ). The fermionic normal ordering on Cliff(û) is the multi-linear operator
defined so that for ui ∈ u and ri ∈ Z + 21 we have
(3.4.4)             : u1 (r1 ) · · · uk (rk ) := sgn(σ)uσ1 (rσ1 ) · · · uσk (rσk )

where σ is any permutation of the index set {1, . . . , k} such that rσ1 ≤ · · · ≤ rσk .
For elements in Cliff(ûθ ) the fermionc normal ordering is defined in steps by first
setting

for ui ∈ u. Then in the situation that ni ∈ Z are such that ni ≤ ni+1 for all i, and
there are some s and t (with 1 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ k) such that nj = 0 for s ≤ j ≤ t, we set
(3.4.6)
 : u1 (n1 ) · · · uk (nk ) := u1 (n1 ) · · · us−1 (ns−1 ) : us (0) · · · ut (0) : ut+1 (nt+1 ) · · · uk (nk )
Finally, for arbitrary ni ∈ Z we set
(3.4.7)            : u1 (n1 ) · · · uk (nk ) := sgn(σ) : uσ1 (nσ1 ) · · · uσk (nσk ) :
where σ is again any permutation of the index set {1, . . . , k} such that nσ1 ≤ · · · ≤
nσk , and we extend the definition multi-linearly to Cliff(ûθ ).
  Now for u ∈ u we define the generating    function, denoted u(z), of operators on
A(u)Θ = A(u) ⊕ A(u)θ by u(z) = r∈ 1 Z u(r)z −r−1/2 . Note that u(r) acts as 0 on
                                  P

A(u) if r ∈ Z, and acts as 0 on A(u)θ if r ∈ Z + 21 . To an element a ∈ A(u) of the
form a = u1 (−m1 − 12 ) · · · uk (−mk − 21 )1 for ui ∈ u and mi ∈ Z≥0 , we associate the
operator valued power series Y (a, z), given by
(3.4.8)                     Y (a, z) =: Dz(m1 ) ui1 (z) · · · Dz(mk ) uik (z) :
We define the vertex operator correspondence
(3.4.9)                     Y (· , z) : A(u) ⊗ A(u)Θ → A(u)Θ ((z 1/2 ))
by setting Y (a, z)b = Y (a, z)b when b ∈ A(u), and by setting Y (a, z)b = Y (e∆z a, z)b
when b ∈ A(u)θ , where ∆z is the expression defined by

Set ω = − 4 i ei (− 2 )ei (− 2 )1 ∈ A(u)2 . Then one has the following
Theorem 3.4 ([FFR91]). The map Y defines a structure of self-dual rational
SVOA on A(u) when restricted to A(u) ⊗ A(u). The Virasoro element is given
by ω, and the rank is 21 dim(u). The map Y defines a structure of θ-twisted A(u)-
module on A(u)θ when restricted to A(u) ⊗ A(u)θ .
  The definition of Y (a, z)b for b ∈ A(u)θ appears quite complicated, but all we
need to know about these operators is contained in the following
Proposition 3.5. Let b ∈ A(u)θ .
   (1) If a = 1 ∈ A(u)0 then Y (a, z)b = b.
   (2) If a ∈ A(u)1 then ∆z a = 0 so that Y (a, z)b = Y (a, z)b.
   (3) If a ∈ A(u)2 then ∆z a = 0 and Y (a, z)b = Y (a, z)b unless a has non-trivial
       projection onto the span of the vectors ei (− 23 )ei (− 12 )1 for i ∈ Ω.
   (4) For a = ei (− 23 )ei (− 21 )1 we have ∆z a = − 41 z −2 and ∆2z a = 0 so that
       Y (a, z)b = Y (a, z)b − 14 bz −2 in this case.

where h = 16     dim(u). Given a specific choice of E, the embedding of Cliff(u) in
Cliff(ûθ ) gives rise to an isomorphism of CM(u)E with (A(u)θ,E )h , and it will be
convenient to consider these spaces as identified. We may have occasion to replace
u by its complexification C u in the above; in such a situation we shall understand
A(C u)Θ to be the complexified space C A(u)Θ .

                                4. Structure of Af ♮
4.1. Construction. Suppose that Ω is some finite set with cardinality 24 and an
arbitrary ordering. Let l be a 24 dimensional vector space over R with positive
definite bilinear form, and let E = {ei }i∈Ω be an orthonormal basis for l. The goal
of this section is to show that the space Af ♮ given by
(4.1.1)                           Af ♮ = A(l)0 ⊕ A(l)0θ
admits a structure of self-dual rational N = 1 SVOA.
   Let G ⊂ P(Ω) be a copy of the Golay code. Let G be an FE2 -homogeneous
subgroup of Spin(l) such that G does not contain −1 ∈ Spin(l) and the associated
code C(G) is G. Curtesy of §3 we have the Cliff(l)-module CM(l)G = Cliff(l)⊗RG R1 ,
and this space can be used to give an explicit realization of the A(l)-module A(l)θ .
From now on we set A(l)θ = A(l)θ,G . Notice that the odd parity subspace of Af ♮ is
precisely A(l)0θ . Since l has dimension 24, the L(0)-homogeneous subspace of A(l)θ
with minimal degree is (A(l)θ )3/2 , and this space is identified with the Cliff(l)-
module CM(l)G . Note that 1θ ↔ 1G under this identification. Also, the bilinear
form on Af ♮ coincides with that on Cliff(l)G when restricted to (Af ♮ )3/2 , and in
particular, is normalized so that h1θ |1θ i = 1.
   We require a vertex operator correspondence Y : Af ♮ ⊗ Af ♮ → Af ♮ ((z)) and as
yet this map is defined only on (Af ♮ )0̄ ⊗ (Af ♮ )0̄ and on (Af ♮ )0̄ ⊗ (Af ♮ )1̄ . Such a
map Y must satisfy skew-symmetry if it exists, so for u ⊗ v ∈ (Af ♮ )1̄ ⊗ (Af ♮ )0̄ we
define Y (u, z)v by
(4.1.2)                      Y (u, z)v = ezL(−1) Y (v, −z)u
(since |u||v| = 0 in this case). Suppose now that u ⊗ v ∈ (Af ♮ )1̄ ⊗ (Af ♮ )1̄ . Motivated
by §2.6 we define Y (u, z)v by requiring that for any w ∈ (Af ♮ )0̄ we should have
(4.1.3)         hY (u, z)v | wi = (−1)n hv | Y (ezL(1) z −2L(0) u, z −1 )wi
whenever u ∈ (Af ♮ )n−1/2 for n ∈ Z. Now the operator on the right of (4.1.3) is
defined by (4.1.2). We can use this later expression to rewrite (4.1.3) in terms
of the operator Y defined on (Af ♮ )0̄ ⊗ Af ♮ in §3.4, and doing so we obtain the
following convenient working definition for the operator Y on (Af ♮ )1̄ ⊗ (Af ♮ )1̄ . For
u ∈ (Af ♮ )n−1/2 with n ∈ Z, for v ∈ (Af ♮ )1̄ and w ∈ (Af ♮ )0̄ we have
                                             −1
(4.1.4)        hY (u, z)v | wi = (−1)n hez        L(1)
                                                         v | Y (w, −z −1 )ezL(1) z −2L(0) ui
Proposition 4.1. The map Y : Af ♮ ⊗ Af ♮ → Af ♮ ((z)) defines a structure of rank
12 self-dual rational SVOA on Af ♮ .
18                                   JOHN F. DUNCAN


Proof. Let C Af ♮ denote the complexification of Af ♮ . Then (C Af ♮ )0̄ is a simple VOA
of rank 12, and (C Af ♮ )1̄ is an irreducible module over (C Af ♮ )0̄ . Let us write Yk̄l̄ for
the restriction of Y to (C Af ♮ )k̄ ⊗ (C Af ♮ )l̄ for k, l ∈ {0, 1}.
     By the Boson-Fermion correspondence [Fre81] (see also [DM94]) we have that
(C Af ♮ )0̄ is isomorphic to a lattice VOA C VM0 where M0 is an even lattice of type
D12 . The irreducible modules over a lattice VOA C VL for L an even lattice are
known to be indexed by the cosets of L in its dual L∗ = {u ∈ R ⊗Z L | hu, Li ⊂ Z}
[Don93]. In particular, a lattice VOA is rational. Further, it is known that the
fusion algebra associated to the modules over C VL coincides with the group algebra
of L∗ /L in the natural way. (One may refer to [DL93] for a thorough treatment.)
In the case that L = M0 , there are exactly three non-trivial cosets, and for any one
of these M0 + µ say, the set M0 ∪ (M0 + µ) forms an integral lattice in R L = R ⊗Z L,
and in particular, M0∗ /M0 ∼    = Z/2 × Z/2 has exponent two.
     From this we conclude that C Af ♮ is isomorphic to C VM for M = M0 ∪ (M0 + µ)
for some µ ∈ M0∗ \ M0 , that     there exist unique up to scale intertwiners of types
     M0 +µ                M0
 M0 +µ M0      and   M0 +µ M0 +µ for C VM0 , and that these intertwiners are just those
obtained by restricting the SVOA structure on C VM . In particular, there is a
unique structure of rank 12 SVOA on C Af ♮ . On the other hand it is known from
[DLM96] for example, that the maps Y1̄0̄ and Y1̄1̄ defined by equations (4.1.2) and
(4.1.4), respectively, yield intertwining operators of types 1̄1̄0̄ = MM           0 +µ
                                                                                        
                                                                                 0 +µ M0
                                                                                            and
  0̄             M0                               f♮
                      
 1̄ 1̄   =  M0 +µ M0 +µ  , respectively, for (C A    )0̄ . By uniqueness,  they must  coincide
with those inherited from the SVOA structure on C VM up to some scalar factors,
and in any case the map Y defined above furnishes C Af ♮ with a structure of rational
rank 12 SVOA. We have chosen scalars in such a way that Af ♮ is a real form for
      f♮                                                                                 f♮
C A . One can check directly that M is a self-dual lattice (given that (A )1/2
                                               +
is trivial, M must be a copy of the D12 lattice — the unique self-dual lattice of
rank 12 with no vectors of unit norm [CS93, Ch.19]), and it follows from the above
that C VM and C Af ♮ are then self-dual SVOAs. This completes the proof of the
proposition.                                                                                  
Remark 4.2. The method used here to extend the vertex operator map from a VOA
to the sum of the VOA and a module over it was given earlier in [Hua96].
   The following proposition gives a convenient criterion for when a vector in
(Af ♮ )3/2 is superconformal. In section §5 it will be shown that all such vectors
are equivalent up to the action of Spin(l).
Proposition 4.3. Suppose that t ∈ (Af ♮ )3/2 is such that ht|ti = 8 and heC (0)t|ti =
0 whenever C ⊂ Ω has cardinality two or four. Then t is a superconformal vector
for Af ♮ .
Proof. We should compute tn t for n = 0, n = 1 and n = 2, and then compare with
the results of Proposition 2.4. Using (4.1.4) and recalling t ∈ (Af ♮ )2−1/2 we find
that for arbitrary u ∈ Af ♮ we have
                                                                     −1
                  hu|Y (t, z)ti =hY (u, −z −1)ezL(1) z −2L(0) t|ez        L(1)
                                                                                 ti
(4.1.5)                                      −1            −3
                                =hY (u, −z        )t|tiz
Then for tn t we obtain
(4.1.6)          hu|tn ti = Resz=0 hY (u, −z −1 )t|tiz n−3 = hu−n+1 t|ti(−1)n−2
           SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                             19


For L(0)-homogeneous u ∈ Af ♮ the expression (4.1.6) is zero unless u ∈ (Af ♮ )−n+2 .
In order to determine tn t, we should compute um t for various u ∈ (Af ♮ )0 , and apply
the equation (4.1.6). To compute um t we will use the results of Proposition 3.5.
    For n = 2 the expression (4.1.6) is zero unless u ∈ (Af ♮ )0 = R1, in which case we
obtain h1|t2 ti = h1−1 t|ti. Since Y (1, z) = 1 and h1|1i = 1, we find that t2 t = ht|ti1.
    For the case that n = 1 we should consider the u in (Af ♮ )1 . Suppose u =
ei (− 12 )ej (− 12 )1 for i 6= j ∈ Ω. Then
(4.1.7)                  Y (u, z)t = Y (u, z)t = eij (0)tz −1 + . . .
By hypothesis we have that eij (0)t is orthogonal to t, so t1 t = 0.
   Finally, when n = 0 we are concerned with u1 t for u ∈ (Af ♮ )2 . The space
(A )2 is spanned by the vectors of the form ei (− 23 )ej (− 21 )1 for i, j ∈ Ω, and
   f♮

also by the eC (− 21 )1 for C = {i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 } ⊂ Ω. For u one of these vectors we
have Y (u, z)t = Y (u, z)t = eC (0)tz −2 + . . . for C ⊂ Ω of size two or four unless
u = ei (− 32 )ei (− 21 )1. In the former cases, u1 t is orthogonal to t by hypothesis, and
in the later case we have
(4.1.8)              Y (u, z)t = Y (u, z)t − 41 tz −2 = − 41 tz −2 + . . .
The expression (4.1.6) now reduces to hu|t0 ti = − 14 ht|ti = −2, and we conclude
that t0 t = − 12 Ω ei (− 23 )ei (− 12 )1 since we have hu|ui = 4 for u = ei (− 32 )ei (− 12 )1
                P
for any i in Ω.
   We have verified that t2 t = 8, t1 t = 0 and t0 t = 2ω. Since the rank of Af ♮ is 12
and 8 = 32 12, an application of Proposition 2.4 confirms that t is superconformal
for Af ♮ .                                                                                   
             √
   Set τA = 81θ ∈ (Af ♮ )3/2 . Then hτA |τA i = 8, and we have

Corollary 4.4. The vector τA is a superconformal vector for Af ♮ .
Proof. That τA satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 4.3 is a consequence of the
fact that the Golay code G = C(G) has minimum weight 8.                         

   We record the results of Proposition 4.1 and Corollary 4.4 in the following
Theorem 4.5. The quadruple (Af ♮ , Y, 1, τA ) is a self-dual rational N = 1 SVOA.
4.2. Symmetries. In this section we show that the automorphism group of the
N = 1 SVOA structure on Af ♮ is isomorphic to Conway’s largest sporadic group,
Co1 .
    The operators x0 for x ∈ A(l)1 span a Lie algebra of type D12 in End(A(l)Θ ), and
the exponentials exp(x0 ) for x ∈ A(l)1 generate a group S say, which acts as A(l)0 -
module automorphisms of A(l)Θ = A(l) ⊕ A(l)θ . This group S is isomorphic to the
group Spin(l), and we may choose the isomorphism so that exp(x0 ) in S corresponds
to exp( 12 (ab − ba)) in Spin(l) < Cliff(l)× when x = a(− 21 )b(− 21 )1 ∈ A(l)1 for some
a, b ∈ l. The action of S on A(l)Θ commutes with the action of θ, and so preserves
the subspace Af ♮ = A(l)0 ⊕ A(l)0θ . The kernel of this action is the group of order
2 generated by θ. Taking the complexification C l in place of l in the above we
obtain an action of the complex Lie group Spin(C l) on the complexified SVOA
    f♮
CA     = A(C l)0 ⊕ A(C l)0θ . Let us write C S for this copy of Spin(C l) generated by
exponentials exp(x0 ) with x in A(C l)1 .
20                                  JOHN F. DUNCAN


Proposition 4.6. The group C S maps surjectively onto the group of SVOA auto-
morphisms of C Af ♮ .
Proof. From the proof of Proposition 4.1 we may regard C Af ♮ as the (complex)
                                                    +
lattice SVOA C VM where M is a lattice of type D12    . Let us write M 0 for the even
sublattice of M (of type D12 ), and M for the unique coset of M 0 in M ; we may
                                         1

write C VM 0 ⊕ C VM 1 for the superspace decomposition of C VM . Let us write G (not
to be confused with the G of §4.1) for the group of SVOA automorphisms of C VM ,
and G0 for the group of VOA automorphisms of C VM 0 . Let S denote the image of
                          f♮
C S in G = AutSVOA (C A ). We wish to show that S = G.
   Any element of G preserves the superspace structure on C VM , so we have a
natural map φ : G → G0 . By a similar token, any element of G0 preserves the Lie
algebra structure on the degree 1 subspace of C VM 0 (we denote this Lie algebra by
g) so we have also a natural map G0 → Aut(g). In fact, this map is faithful and
onto since C VM 0 is generated by its subspace of degree 1 elements, in the sense that
we have
                                1     2       r            i

(4.2.2)         g : x1−n1 x2−n2 · · · xr−nr 1 7→ (gx1 )−n1 (gx2 )−n2 · · · (gxr )−nr 1
and any element of G0 that fixes g fixes all of C VM 0 . Thus we may identify Aut(g)
with G0 .
    We claim that φ(S) = φ(G). In [DN99] it is proved that the automorphism group
of a lattice VOA (for an even positive definite lattice, such as M 0 ) is generated by
exponentials of zero-modes of degree 1 elements and by lifts of automorphisms of
the lattice. In our situation this means G0 = hφ(S), O(M 0 )i where O(M 0 ) denotes
the group of automorphisms of C VM 0 generated by lifts of elements of Aut(M 0 ). On
the other hand, we know that the group Inn(g) of inner automorphisms of g (this is
just our group φ(S)) has index 2 in Aut(g), since g is a simple complex Lie algebra
of type D12 . So there is some x ∈ O(M 0 ) of order 2, such that G0 = φ(S) ∪ xφ(S),
and either φ(G) = φ(S), or φ(G) = G0 . Let x̄ denote the canonical image of x in
Aut(M 0 ). The coset xφ(S) corresponds to a so-called diagram automorphism of
D12 , and x̄ acts non-trivially on the coset space (M 0 )∗ /M 0 interchanging the two
cosets with minimal norm 3 (one of which is M 1 ). In particular, x̄ does not preserve
the lattice M = M 0 + M 1 , and thus x cannot be extended to an automorphism of
C VM (c.f. [DN99, Lemma 2.3]). We conclude that φ(S) = φ(G).
    Next we claim that ker(φ) is contained in S. For suppose g ∈ ker(φ). Then g
fixes all elements of g, and therefore commutes with the action of S on (C VM )3/2 =
CM(C l)0G . The space CM(C l)0G is irreducible for the action of S, so g acts as scalar
multiplication by ζ ∈ C say, on (C VM )3/2 , and indeed, on all of C VM 1 (since C VM 1
is generated by the action of C VM 0 on (C VM )3/2 ). Then for x, y ∈ C VM 1 , we have
g(x(n) y) = (gx)(n) (gy) = ζ 2 x(n) y, and also g(x(n) y) = x(n) y since x(n) y lies in
C VM 0 . It follows that ζ = ±1 and ker(φ) has order 2. In the non-trivial case that
g|C VM 0 = Id and g|C VM 1 = − Id, we have that g is realized by the image of the
element −1 ∈ S in S. This proves the claim.
    We have shown that φ(S) = φ(G) and ker(φ) < S, and it follows that S = G,
which is what we required.                                                           
          SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                       21


     From now on it will be convenient to regard Spin(l) and Spin(C l) as groups of
SVOA automorphisms of Af ♮ and C Af ♮ , respectively.
     Recall that the ordering on Ω is chosen so that eΩ ∈ Spin(l) lies in G. We
denote eΩ also by z. Then the action of eΩ on C Af ♮ is trivial, the kernel of the map
Spin(C l) → AutSVOA (C Af ♮ ) is {1, z}, and the full group of SVOA automorphisms of
     f♮
CA      is Spin(C l)/hzi. Any automorphism of Af ♮ extends to an automorphism of the
complexification C Af ♮ , so Spin(C l)/hzi contains the group of SVOA automorphisms
of the real form Af ♮ . On the other hand, this latter group contains Spin(l)/hzi
which is maximal compact in Spin(C l)/hzi. We conclude that Spin(l)/hzi is the full
group of SVOA automorphisms of the real SVOA Af ♮ .
     Let F denote the subgroup of Spin(C l) that fixes 1G ∈ CM(C l)0G ↔ (C Af ♮ )3/2 .
Then the full group of automorphisms of the N = 1 SVOA structure on C Af ♮ is
F/hzi. Let us write l′ for the span of the vectors u1G ∈ CM(l)G for u ∈ l, and
   ′                              ′                                               ′
C l for the complexification of l , regarded as a subspace of CM(C l)G . Then C l has
                                                    ′                  −1
dimension 24, and F embeds naturally in SO(C l ) since xu1G = xux 1G = x(u)1G
for u ∈ C l and x ∈ F , and x(u) ⊂ u for x ∈ Spin(C l). We will now show
Proposition 4.7. The group F contains a group isomorphic to Co0 .
Proof. Recall that the natural map Spin(C l) → SO(C l) is denoted x 7→ x(·). Recall
that G is an FE2 -homogeneous lift of the Golay code G to Spin(l) (see §3.3), so that
for each C ∈ G there is a unique gC ∈ G such that gC (·) is −1 on ei for i ∈ C, and
+1 on ei otherwise. Let C0 be a subgroup of SO(l) isomorphic to Co0 such that C0
contains g(·) for each g ∈ G < Spin(l). The Golay code construction of the Leech
lattice given in [Con71] for example, shows that this is possible.
   Let Ĉ be the preimage of C0 in Spin(l). The group Co0 has trivial Schur multi-
plier [CCN+ 85] so there exists a group C ′ in Spin(l), a subgroup of index 2 in Ĉ,
such that the map x 7→ x(·) restricts to an isomorphism of C ′ with C0 < SO(l). Set
Ĝ = {gC , −gC | C ∈ G}, and set G′ = Ĝ ∩ C ′ . Then we have G′ = {γC gC | C ∈ G}
where C 7→ γC is a map G → {±1} such that γC γD = γC+D . In particular,
C → γC is a homomorphism, and there must be some S ⊂ Ω such that we have
γC = (−1)hC,Si for all C ∈ G. In other words, we have G′ = {eS geS −1 | g ∈ G}.
   Set C = {eS −1 xeS | x ∈ C ′ }. Then C is isomorphic to Co0 , and contains G.
In particular, C contains the central element z, and C/hzi must be isomorphic to
Co1 . The space CM(l)0G is then a C/hzi-module of dimension 2048 and since the
only Co1 irreducibles with dimension less than 2048 have dimension 1, 276, 299 and
1771 [CCN+ 85], the space CM(l)0G must have a fixed point t say, for the action of
C. We may assume that t has unit norm. Since G is contained in C, the vector t is
also invariant for G, and this forces t = 1G by Proposition 3.3. We conclude that
C is a subgroup of F isomorphic to Co0 , and this completes the proof.             
   The proof of Proposition 4.7 shows that a copy of Co0 may be found even inside
the intersection F ∩ Spin(l).
Proposition 4.8. The group F is finite.
Proof. F is a subgroup of the algebraic group Spin(C l) ∼ = Spin24 (C). The condition
that a subspace be stabilized by a linear transformation is polynomial, so F too is
algebraic, since it is by definition the stabilizer of a subspace in a representation
of Spin(C l). At the same time, F is a subgroup of SO(C l′ ) ∼ = SO24 (C) containing
the algebraic group Co0 by Proposition 4.7. Since the latter group acts irreducibly
22                                JOHN F. DUNCAN


on C l′ , we conclude that F is reductive. We now check if there is any non-trivial
semisimple complex algebraic group or algebraic torus that can occur as a factor
of the connected component of the identity in F . Any such group would have a
non-trivial Lie algebra k say, with an embedding in the Lie algebra g of Spin(C l),
which we may identify with the degree one subspace of C Af ♮ (equipped with the
bracket [x, y] = x0 y). Now for all x ∈ k we have exp(x0 )1G = 1G , and this implies
x0 1G = 0 for some non-trivial x ∈ k. We claim that if x ∈ g satisfies x0 1G = 0
then x = 0. For consider the map g → CM(C l)G given by x 7→ x0 1G , and write g′
for the image of g under this map. Then the dimension of g′ is at most 276. On
the other hand g′ contains the span of the vectors {eij 1G } for i < j, and since the
Golay code has minimum weight 8 these vectors are linearly independent, and we
see that g′ has dimension not less than 276. It follows that the map x 7→ x0 1G
is a linear isomorphism from g to g′ , and in particular, the kernel is trivial. This
verifies the claim. We conclude that dim(F ) = 0, whence F is finite.              

   We have shown that F is a finite subgroup of Spin(C l) such that F ∩ Spin(l)
contains a copy of Co0 . Our last main task for this section is to show that F itself
is isomorphic to Co0 . With this in mind, we offer the following proposition, the
proof of which owes much to the methods used in Theorems 5.6 and 6.5 of [NRS01].
In particular, we utilize the notion of primitive matrix group: a group G ≤ GL(V ),
for V a vector space, is said to be primitive if there is no non-trivial decomposition
V = V1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vk into subspaces permuted by the the action of G. Note that if N
is normal in G, then G permutes the isotypic components of the restricted module
V |N , so that V |N must be multiple copies of a single irreducible representation for
N in the case that G is primitive.
Proposition 4.9. The group Co0 is a maximal subgroup of SO24 (C) subject to
being finite.
Proof. Any compact subgroup of SOn (C) is realizable over R (c.f. [Ser77, §13.2]), so
it suffices to show that Co0 is a maximal finite subgroup of SO24 (R). Let V denote
a real vector space of dimension 24, equipped with a non-degenerate symmetric
bilinear form. Suppose that F is a finite subgroup of SO(V ) properly containing
a copy C of the group Co0 . Then C is not normal in F , since C acts absolutely
irreducibly on V , and if C were normal in F then F/C would embed in the outer
automorphism group of C, which is trivial [CCN+ 85]. Let us write Z for the center
{± Id} of C (and F ).
    We claim that F has no non-trivial normal p-subgroups for p odd, and the only
non-trivial normal 2-subgroup is Z. For suppose N is a normal p-subgroup of F
for some prime p. Then CF (N ) ∩ C (we write CF (N ) for the centralizer in F of
N ) is normal in C and contains Z, so that CF (N ) ∩ C is either Z or C. In the
former case we have that C/Z ∼   = Co1 is a subgroup of Aut(N ). In the latter case,
N is centralized by (the absolutely irreducible action of) C, and hence must consist
of scalar matrices. It follows that N is trivial unless p = 2, in which case N is
either trivial or N = Z. We suppose then that N is a normal p-subgroup of F
such that Aut(N ) contains a copy of Co1 . The group C acts primitively on V ,
and even on the complexification C V = C ⊗R V , and hence so does F . It follows
that C V |N is an isotypic module for N ; i.e. several copies of a single irreducible
module M say, for N . Since N is by definition a subgroup of SO24 (R), it follows
that M is the complexification of an irreducible N -module R M say, defined over
           SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                        23


R, and that the action of N on R M is faithful. Any p-group has non-trivial center,
and a central subgroup of a group acts by scalar multiplications on any irreducible
module for that group. We conclude that p is not odd, since a p-group for odd p
has central elements which must act as multiplication by primitive (and non-real)
p-th roots of unity. We see also that any abelian normal subgroup of F is cyclic.
The irreducible representations of a p-group are of p-power order, so deg(R M ) is
a power of 2 dividing 24. Without loss of generality, we suppose deg(R M ) = 8.
Note that N can contain no noncyclic characteristic abelian subgroups, since such
a subgroup would be a noncyclic normal abelian p-subgroup of F . A p-group with
this property is said to be of symplectic type, and such groups are classified by a
Theorem of P. Hall (c.f. [Asc00, (23.9)]). In particular, there are no 2-groups of
symplectic type that both embed in SO8 (R) and admit a non-trivial action by Co1
as automorphisms. The claim follows.
   Now we seek a contradiction. Any finite group is realizable over a cyclotomic
number field (c.f. [Ser77, Thm 24]). In fact we may assume that F is a subgroup of
                                                                                 −1
SO24 (K) where K is a totally real abelian number field (e.g. K = Q(ζm + ζm         ) for
               m
m such that x = 1 for all x ∈ F and ζm = exp(2πi/m) — c.f. [Dre75, Prop 5.6]).
Let K be a minimal such field, and let R be the ring of integers in K. Then F
preserves an RC-lattice, and such a lattice is of the form I ⊗Z Λ for Λ a copy of the
Leech lattice and I a fractional ideal of R, since any C invariant lattice in Q24 is
isometric to Λ (c.f. [Tie97]). It follows that F preserves the lattice R ⊗Z Λ. (To see
this, note that if F preserves a lattice L, then it also preserves aL for any a ∈ K.
Also, if F preserves lattices L1 and L2 , then it preserves the sum L1 + L2 . Now
take L = I ⊗Z Λ for I a fractional idealP             P {yi } be a set of generators for
                                           of R, and let
the inverse fractional ideal. Then R = yi I, and         yi L = R ⊗Z Λ is also invariant
for F .) We may now regard F as a group of matrices with entries in the ring R. If
K = Q then F = C and we are done. If not, then there is some rational prime p
that ramifies in K. Let p be a prime ideal of R lying above p, and let Γp denote the
subgroup of Gal(K/Q) consisting of automorphisms σ such that σ(a) ≡ a (mod p)
for all a ∈ R. (This is the first inertia group. It stabilizes p, and has order equal
to the ramification index of p over p — c.f. [FT93, III:4]) The Galois group of K
over Q acts on F by acting componentwise on matrices. Let Fp = {g ∈ F | g ≡ Id
(mod p)}, let σ be a non-trivial element of Γp , and let φ : F → Fp be the map
defined by φ(g) = g −1 σ(g) for g ∈ F . The group Fp is a normal p-subgroup of
F , and we have shown that such a group is trivial except possibly in the case that
p = 2. If Fp is trivial then σ fixes F , and this contradicts the minimality of K.
So suppose p = 2 and Fp is the group Z = {± Id}. Then φ is in fact a group
homomorphism F → Z (since g −1 σ(g) is now central for all g ∈ F ). Since the
image of φ is abelian, the derived subgroup F (1) of F lies in the kernel of φ, and
is thus fixed by σ. If F = F (1) then F is realizable over the subfield of K fixed
by σ, contradicting the minimality of K. So F properly contains F (1) , and the
argument thus far shows that any finite subgroup of SO24 (R) properly containing
C, properly contains its own derived subgroup. Consider now the descending chain
F ≥ F (1) ≥ F (2) ≥ · · · where F (k+1) is the derived subgroup of F (k) . Each term
contains C since F > C and C = C (1) , and thus each containment F (k) ≥ F (k+1)
is proper unless F (k) = C. Since F is finite, not all containments are proper, and
thus we have F (k) = C for some k. Then C is a characteristic subgroup of F , and
in particular, is normal in F , and this is again a contradiction.

     We conclude that Co0 is a maximal subgroup of SO24 (C) subject to being finite.
                                                                                  

     We have established the following
Theorem 4.10. The subgroup of Spin(C l) fixing 1G ∈ CM(C l)G is isomorphic to
Co0 .
    Recall that Aut(C Af ♮ ) = F/hzi. The group hzi is the center of F , and thus F/hzi
is isomorphic to Co1 . By construction this copy of Co1 is contained in Aut(Af ♮ ).
We have therefore established
Theorem 4.11. There are isomorphisms of groups Aut(C Af ♮ ) ∼
                                                            = Aut(Af ♮ ) ∼
                                                                         = Co1 .
Remark 4.12. It was noted in the Introduction that an action of Co1 on the SVOA
underlying Af ♮ was considered earlier in [BR96]. In fact, an action of Co0 (the
perfect double cover of Co1 ) on the SVOA underlying Af ♮ was also considered in
[BR96], and in our setting, this action arises naturally by considering the action of
the group F on the object Af ♭ given by
(4.2.3)                          Af ♭ = A(l)0 ⊕ A(l)1θ

where we realize A(l)θ as A(l)G,θ with G as in §4.1. We have seen that the group F
is isomorphic to the quasi-simple group Co0 , and in contrast to the situation with
Af ♮ the central element of F acts non-trivially on Af ♭ . The same method used in
§4.1 shows that Af ♭ has a unique structure of SVOA, and also that Af ♮ and Af ♭
are isomorphic, as SVOAs. There is however no Co0 invariant vector in the degree
3/2 subspace of Af ♭ , and hence no Co0 invariant N = 1 structure on Af ♭ .


                                   5. Uniqueness
   In this section we prove a uniqueness result for Af ♮ . In the first subsection we
verify that any nice rational N = 1 SVOA satisfying
       • self-dual
       • rank 12
       • no small elements
is isomorphic to C Af ♮ as an SVOA. To do this we first recall the modularity results
for trace functions on VOAs due to Zhu (see [Zhu90], [Zhu96]), and their extension
to the SVOA case given in [Höh96]. Then we make use of some techniques from
[DM04b] and [DM04a], replacing VOA concepts with their SVOA analogues as
necessary. The guiding principle that we adopt from these two papers is that one
may use modular invariance results for a VOA V to deduce properties about the
Lie algebra structure on V1 , the degree one subspace of V .
    In the second subsection we show that the N = 1 structure on Af ♮ is unique in
the sense that if τ ∈ (Af ♮ )3/2 is a superconformal vector then there is some SVOA
automorphism of Af ♮ mapping τ to τA .

5.1. SVOA structure. Recall from §2.1 and §2.2 the definitions of niceness and
rationality for an SVOA. Recall also from §2.2 that a rational SVOA has finitely
many irreducible modules up to equivalence.

5.1.1. Theta group. Let Γ = SL(2, Z) and recall that the modular group Γ̄ =
Γ/{±1} = PSL(2, Z) acts faithfully on the upper half plane h = {σ+it | t > 0} ⊂ C,
with the action generated by modular transformations S and T where S : τ 7→ −1/τ
and T : τ 7→ τ + 1. We identify Γ̄ with its image in the isometry group of h and
set Γ̄θ = hS, T 2 i. The compactification of the quotient space Γ̄\h is topologically a
sphere, and the same is true for Γ̄θ \h. The space Γ̄θ \h has two cusps, with repre-
sentatives 1 and ∞. There is a unique holomorphic function on h that is invariant
under Γ̄θ , has a q expansion of the form q −1/2 + a + bq 1/2 + cq + . . ., and vanishes at
1. We denote this function by Jθ (τ ) since it is an analogue of the J function, which
generates the field of functions on the compactified curve Γ̄\h. The function Jθ
furnishes a bijective map from the compactification of Γ̄θ \h to the Riemann sphere
C ∪ {∞}. One has the following expression for Jθ (τ ).
                             η(τ )48
            Jθ (τ ) =
(5.1.1)                 η(τ /2)24 η(2τ )24
                   = q −1/2 + 24 + 276q 1/2 + 2048q + 11202q 3/2 + 49152q 2 + · · ·
To see the behavior of Jθ at 1, note that T Sτ → 1 as τ → ∞. For Jθ |T S we have
                                                   η(2τ )24
              Jθ |T S = Jθ (−1/τ + 1) = −212
(5.1.2)                                            η(τ )24
                                           = −(4096q + 98304q 2 + 1228800q 3 + . . .)
confirming that Jθ vanishes as τ → 1. We write Γθ for the preimage of Γ̄θ in Γ.

5.1.2. Modular Invariance. Suppose now that (V, Y, 1, ω) is a nice rational VOA.
Following [Zhu96] we may define a new VOA structure on the space V as follows.
We define the genus one VOA associated to V to be the four-tuple (V, Y [ ], 1, ω̃)
where ω̃ = (2πi)2 (ω − c/24) and the linear map Y [ ] : V ⊗ V → V ((z)) is defined
so that
                          X
(5.1.3)        Y [u, z] =    u[n] z −n−1 = Y (u, e2πiz − 1)edeg(u)2πiz
                                n∈Z

for u an L(0)-homogeneous element in V . The object thus defined is again a VOA
and is isomorphic to (V, Y, 1, ω) [Zhu96]. In particular the coefficients of Y [ω̃, z]
define a representation of the Virasoro algebra with central charge c. We write
                                             X
(5.1.4)                   L[z] = Y [ω̃, z] =   L[n]z −n−2
                                                    Z

and for n ∈ Z, we set V[n] = {u ∈ V | L[0]u = nu}. Note that for u an L(0)-
homogeneous element in V we have
                      X
           Y [u, z] =   un (e2πiz − 1)−n−1 edeg(u)2πiz
                            n
                            X
(5.1.5)                 =       un (2πiz + 21 (2πiz)2 + . . .)−n−1 edeg(u)2πiz
                            n
                            X
                        =       (2πi)−n−1 un z −n−1 (1 + 21 2πiz + . . .)−n−1 edeg(u)2πiz
                            n

and in particular, u[n] = (2πi)−n−1 un + k>0 ck un+k for some constants ck ∈ C.
                                          P
If u, v ∈ V1 then u1 v = hu|vi1 and un v = 0 for n > 1 so we have the following

The function G2 (τ ) has a q expansion which may be expressed in the form
                                                         ∞

                                              3         n=1

where σ1 (n) is the sum of the divisors of n. We denote the corresponding formal
power series (that is, element of C[[q]]) by G̃2 (q).
   We define a linear function o(·) : V → End(V ) by setting o(u) = udeg(u)−1 for
L(0)-homogeneous u ∈ V . The following result is a special case of Proposition 4.3.5
in [Zhu96].
Proposition 5.2 ([Zhu96]). Let V be a nice rational SVOA and M a finitely
generated V -module. Then for u, v ∈ V1 we have
(5.1.8)       tr|M o(u)o(v)q L(0) = tr|M o(u[−1] v)q L(0) − G̃2 (q)tr|M o(u[1] v)q L(0)
   Let V be a nice rational SVOA and let M be a finitely generated V -module. For
an n-tuple (u1 , . . . , un ) of L(0)-homogeneous elements in V we define the following
formal series.
                F̃M ((u1 , x1 ), . . . , (un , xn ); q)
(5.1.9)               deg(u1 )
                 = x1            · · · xndeg(un ) tr|M Y (u1 , x1 ) · · · Y (un , xn )q L(0)
We extend the definition of F̃M to arbitrary n-tuples of elements from V by linearity.
As in [Zhu96, Th 4.2.1] One can show that this series F̃M converges to a holomorphic
function in the domain
(5.1.10)               {(x1 , . . . , xn , q) | 1 > |x1 | > . . . > |xn | > |q|}
and can be continuously extended to be meromorphic in the domain
(5.1.11)                         {(x1 , . . . , xn , q) | xi 6= 0, |q| < 1}
We denote the meromorphic function so obtained by FM . We substitute variables
xi with e2πizi and q with e2πiτ , and we set
(5.1.12)      TM ((u1 , z1 ), . . . , (un , zn ); τ ) = q −c/24 FM ((u1 , x1 ), . . . , (un , xn ); q)
Following [Zhu96] and [Höh96] we call TM ((u1 , z1 ), . . . , (un , zn ); τ ) the n-point cor-
relation function on the torus with parameter τ for the operators Y (ui , zi ) and the
module M .
Proposition 5.3 ([Zhu96],[Höh96]). The function TM ((u1 , z1 ), . . . , (un , zn ); τ ) is
doubly periodic in each variable zi with periods 1 and 2τ , and possible singularities
only at the points zi = zj + k + lτ for i 6= j, k, l ∈ Z. For j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and uj an
L(0)-homogeneous element of V we have
(5.1.13)        TM (. . . , (uj , zj + τ ), . . . ; τ ) = (−1)p(uj ) TM (. . . , (uj , zj ), . . . ; τ )

For a permutation σ ∈ Sn we have
(5.1.14)
    TM ((u1 , z1 ), . . . , (un , zn ); τ ) = (−1)w TM ((uσ(1) , zσ(1) ), . . . , (uσ(n) , zσ(n) ); τ )
where w is the number of permutations of the elements ui that lie in V1̄ .
                                                                          S∞
   We denote by TM the mapping defined on the set n=1 ((V × C)n × h) that sends
((u1 , z1 ), . . . , (un , zn ); τ ) to TM ((u1 , z1 ), . . . , (un , zn ); τ ).
   Suppose now that {M 1 , . . . , M r } is a complete list of irreducible V -modules.
The superconformal block on the torus associated to the SVOA V is the C-vector
space spanned by the r mappings TM i . We denote it by SBV .
   The following result is an analogue for SVOAs of a celebrated theorem due to
Zhu concerning the modularity properties of n-point correlation functions on the
torus associated to the vertex operators on VOAs. As is indicated in [Höh96], this
analogue may be proven in a manner directly analogous to that of the VOA version
given in [Zhu96], and one should use the SVOA analogues of Zhu algebras defined
in [KW94].
Theorem 5.4 ([Zhu96],[KW94],[Höh96]). Let V be a nice rational SVOA and sup-
pose that {M 1 , . . . , M r } is a complete list of irreducible V -modules. Then the su-
perconformal block on the torus associated to V is r-dimensional and the functions
TM i form a basis. Moreover, there exists a representation ρ of Γθ on SBV such
that for Virasoro highest weight vectors {u1 , . . . , un } ∈ V the n-point correlation
functions on the torus for the operators Y (ui , zi ) and the modules M i satisfy the
following transformation property

where A = c d is an element of Γθ and (ρ(A)ij ) is the matrix representing ρ(A) ∈
End(SBV ) with respect to the basis {TM i }.
   In the case that n = 1 the function TM ((u, z); τ ) is elliptic in the variable z
and without poles, and is therefore constant with respect to z. We may therefore
set TM (u; τ ) = TM ((u, z); τ ). Note that TM (u; τ ) = tr|M o(u)q L(0)−c/24 , and in
particular TM (1; τ ) = tr|M q L(0)−c/24 .
Corollary 5.5. Let V be a self-dual nice rational SVOA. Then SBV is one di-
mensional, and for u ∈ V0̄ a Virasoro highest weight vector with deg(u) = k, the
function tr|M o(u)q L(0)−c/24 is a weight k modular form on Γ̄θ , possibly with char-
acter.
Remark 5.6. Corollary 5.5 now appears as a special case of the more general The-
orem 3 of [DZ05] which incorporates also g-twisted SVOA modules for g in a finite
group of automorphisms of a suitable SVOA V .
   We apply Corollary 5.5 immediately with u = 1 in order to determine the char-
acter of an SVOA satisfying our hypotheses.

Proposition 5.7. Suppose that V is a self-dual nice rational SVOA of rank 12.
Then we have
         tr|V q L(0)−c/24 = Jθ (τ ) + dim(V1/2 ) − 24
(5.1.16)
                          = q −1/2 + dim(V1/2 ) + 276q 1/2 + 2048q + 11202q 3/2 + . . .
for the character of V .
                                    L(0)−c/24
Proof. Let us set f (τ ) = tr|P  Vq           . By hypothesis, f (τ ) admits a Fourier
                          −1/2
expansion of the form q        + n≥0 fn q n/2 with all the fn non-negative integers. By
Corollary 5.5 we know that f (τ ) is holomorphic on h and is invariant for the action
of Γθ . It follows that f (τ ) = P (Jθ )/Q(Jθ ) for some polynomials P (X), Q(X) ∈
C[X], with deg(P ) = deg(Q) + 1, and we may assume that P and Q are both monic
and have no common factors. The function Jθ (τ ) is a surjective map from h to
C \ {0}, so that for f (τ ) to be holomorphic we must have Q(X) = X m for some m.
Then we have
(5.1.17)             f (τ ) = Jθ + am + am−1 Jθ−1 + · · · + a0 Jθ−m
for P (X) = X m+1 +am X m +· · ·+a0 with a0 6= 0 unless possibly if m = 0. We claim
that m = 0 and am = a0 = dim(V1/2 ) − 24. Certainly, am = dim(V1/2 ) − 24, since
the first two terms of (5.1.17) determine the first two Fourier coefficients of f (τ ).
Let us write Jθ (τ )−d = n r−d (n)q n/2 . Then the sequence {r−d (n)}n alternates
                           P
in sign when d is positive, as can be seen from the following identity.
                              η(τ /2)24d η(2τ )24d         Y         1
(5.1.18)          Jθ (τ )−d =            48d
                                                   = q d/2          n+1/2
                                    η(τ )                    (1 + q       )24d
We see also from this that for d > 0, the value of |r−d (n)| is the number of partitions
of n − d into odd parts with 24d colors. The asymptotic behavior of such functions
is described by Theorem 1 of [Mei54], and we will quote this result presently. The
value of r1 (n) is the number of partitions of n+1 into odd parts of 24 colors without
replacement, and for the asymptotics of this function we refer to Proposition 1 of
[Hwa01]. The result is that we have
                              √                               √   √
                          e2π n                        e2π 2d n
(5.1.19)       r1 (n) ∼ C1 3/4   and |r−d (n)| ∼ C−d               for d > 0,
                           n                              n3/4
for some constants Ck . Evidently, the growth of the r−m (n) outstrips that of the
r−d (n) for 1 ≥ −d ≥ −m + 1 if m > 0. In particular, the fn can be all non-negative
integers only if m = 0.                                                          
   As demonstrated in [DZ05], one may recover a modular invariance under the
full modular group for the trace functions associated to an SVOA by considering
canonically twisted modules together with untwisted modules. The following result
is a special case of Theorem 1 of [DZ05] where we take V to be self-dual, and G to
be the group of SVOA automorphisms generated by the canonical automorphism
of V . Recall from §2.4 that if V is a self-dual rational C2 -cofinite SVOA, then Vσ
denotes the unique σ-stable σ-twisted V -module, and σ-stable here means that Vσ
admits a compatible action by σ.
Proposition 5.8 ([DZ05]). Let V be a self-dual rational C2 -cofinite SVOA. Let
w ∈ V such that w ∈ V[k] for some k. Then for γ ∈ Γ, we have
(5.1.20)      tr|V o(w)q L(0)−c/24 |γ = (cτ + d)k ρ(γ)tr|W o(w)σ 1+b+d q L(0)−c/24
           SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                         29


for some ρ(γ) ∈ C independentof w, where
                                         W = Vσ if σ 1+a+c = σ, and W = V
                               a b
otherwise, and γ is the matrix        .
                                c d
   In Proposition 5.7 we determined that the character of a self-dual nice rational
SVOA of rank 12 is Jθ (τ ) + dim(V1/2 ) − 24. Applying Proposition 5.8 with γ = T S
(so that (a, b, c, d) = (1, −1, 1, 0)) we find that the character tr|Vσ q L(0)−c/24 of the
canonically twisted module Vσ over such an SVOA is just α(Jθ |T S + dim(V1/2 )− 24)
for some α ∈ C. Recalling from §5.1.1 that the q expansion of Jθ |T S involves only
positive integer powers of q, we have
Proposition 5.9. Let V be a self-dual nice rational SVOA of rank 12 with V1/2 = 0.
Then (Vσ )n vanishes unless n > 0 and n ∈ Z + 21 .
5.1.3. Structure of V1 . Our plan now is to study the structure of the Lie algebra
on V1 for V satisfying suitable hypotheses. By the end of this section, knowledge
of V1 will determine V uniquely under the conditions we consider. Much of our
method follows that employed in certain sections of [DM04b] and [DM04a], and is
a manifestation of the principle established there that modular invariance for an
SVOA V can be used to make strong conclusions about the structure of V1 .
Proposition 5.10. Suppose that V is a nice N = 1 SVOA with V1/2 = 0. Then
V has a unique non-degenerate invariant bilinear form.
Proof. By the results of [Sch98], the space of invariant bilinear forms on V is in
natural correspondence with the space V0 /L(1)V1 . We have that V0 is one dimen-
sional by hypothesis, so we require to show that L(1)V1 = 0. From the commuta-
tion relations of the Neveu–Schwarz superalgebra we have G( 12 )2 = L(1) so that
L(1)V1 ⊂ G( 12 )V1/2 . Since V1/2 = 0 the result follows.                       
   From now we assume V to be a nice rational N = 1 SVOA with V1/2 = 0. Then
the import of Proposition 5.10 is that V0̄ is a strongly rational VOA in the sense of
[DM04b]. In particular Theorem 1 of [DM04b] yields the following
Theorem 5.11 ([DM04b]). The Lie algebra V1 is reductive.
  Since V1 is reductive, the Lie rank of V1 is well defined. Suppose in addition
now that V is self-dual. We will follow the technique used to prove Theorem 2 in
[DM04b] to establish the following
Theorem 5.12. The Lie rank of V1 is bounded above by rank(V ).
Proof. We set c = rank(V ). Let h be a maximal abelian subalgebra of V1 consisting
of semisimple elements. The Lie rank of V1 is the dimension of h and we denote
this value by l. The bilinear form h · | · i restricts to be non-degenerate on h, and
thus the vertex operators Y (h, z) for h ∈ h generate an affine Lie algebra ĥ, and we
can decompose V as
(5.1.21)                            V = M (1) ⊗ ΩV
where M (1) ≃ S(h−m | h ∈ h, m > 0) is the Heisenberg VOA of rank l associated
to the space h, and ΩV is the vacuum space consisting of vectors u ∈ V such
that hm u = 0 for all h ∈ h and m > 0. Both factors on the right hand side of
(5.1.21) are invariant under the action of L(0), so that (5.1.21) holds even as a
decomposition of L(0)-graded spaces. Taking the trace of q L(0)−c/24 on each side of
30                                   JOHN F. DUNCAN


(5.1.21), multiplying both sides by η(q)c and noting that tr|M(1) q L(0) = q l/24 η(q)−l
we have

(5.1.22)           η(q)c tr|V q L(0)−c/24 = q (l−c)/24 η(q)c−l tr|ΩV q L(0)

The expression on the left hand side of (5.1.22) is a holomorphic modular form on
Γθ (of weight c/2). It is a classical result that the Fourier coefficients r(n) say, of
such a function satisfy r(n) = O(n3p  ). On the other hand, the Fourier coefficients
                                             √
of η(q)−s grow like n−s/4−3/4 exp(π 2s/3 n) whenever s > 0 (c.f. [Mei54, Thm
1]), so we must have c − l ≥ 0. This is what we required to show.                    

Remark 5.13. Certainly one expects Theorem 5.12 to hold not just for the case
that V is self-dual, but the present result is sufficiently strong for our interests.

   The following proposition is an analogue for self-dual rational SVOAs of rank 12
of Corollary 2.3 in [DM04a], and we repeat here the method of proof used there.

Proposition 5.14. Suppose that V is a self-dual nice rational N = 1 SVOA of
rank 12 with V1/2 = 0. Then the Killing form on V1 satisfies κ(· , ·) = 44h · | · i.

Proof. By Proposition 5.7 we have tr|V q L(0)−c/24 = Jθ (τ ) − 24, and in particular,
dim(V1 ) = 276. Now we apply Proposition 5.2 to V with M = V and use Lemma 5.1
to rewrite the conclusion as

(5.1.23)
                                                              hu|vi
     tr|V o(u)o(v)q L(0)−1/2 = tr|V o(u[−1] v)q L(0)−1/2 +          G̃2 (q)tr|V q L(0)−1/2
                                                               4π 2

The leading term of the second summand on the right hand side of (5.1.23) is
             1
therefore 12   hu|viq −1/2 , but the leading term on the left hand side of (5.1.23) is
         1/2
κ(u, v)q      where κ(· , ·) is the Killing form on V1 . We conclude that the leading
                                                                              1
term of the first summand on the right hand side of (5.1.23) is − 12            hu|viq −1/2 .
For u, v ∈ V1 set Xu,v (τ ) = tr|V o(u[−1] v)q L(0)−c/24 . We claim that Xu,v (τ ) =
1                 L(0)−c/24
6 hu|viqDq tr|V q            . This is certainly true if hu|vi = 0. Suppose not then, and
note firstly that Xu,v (τ ) is a weight 2 modular form for Γ̄θ by Corollary 5.5, and
                                 1
secondly that Xu,v (τ ) = − 12     hu|viq −1/2 + 0 + aq 1/2 + . . . for some a ∈ C by the
above. Applying Proposition 5.8 with w = u[−1] v and γ = T S, we find

(5.1.24)           Xu,v (−1/τ + 1)τ −2 = α tr|Vσ o(u[−1] v)q L(0)−c/24

for some α in C, and this q series belongs to C[[q]] by Proposition 5.9. From
this we note thirdly, that Xu,v (τ ) is holomorphic at the cusp represented by 1.
We claim that these three properties determine Xu,v (τ ) uniquely, for if X ′ (τ ) is
another such function, then Z(τ ) = Xu,v (τ ) − X ′ (τ ) is a weight two modular form
for Γ̄θ that is holomorphic at both cusps, and vanishes at ∞. The space of weight 2
modular forms that are holomorphic at both cusps is spanned by the theta function
of the lattice Z4 (c.f. [Ran77]), but this function does not vanish at ∞, and the
claim follows. It is easy to check that 16 hu|viqDq tr|V q L(0)−c/24 satisfies the three

properties of Xu,v (τ ) so we may rewrite (5.1.23) as follows.

Equating the coefficients of q 1/2 on each side we have κ(· , ·) = 44h·|·i.               
Theorem 5.15. Let V be a self-dual nice rational N = 1 SVOA with rank 12 and
V1/2 = 0. Then V is isomorphic to C Af ♮ as an SVOA.
Proof. By Proposition 5.10 the bilinear form defined by the adjoint operators is non-
degenerate, and Theorems 5.11 and 5.12 show that V1 is a reductive Lie algebra
with Lie rank bounded above by 12. From Proposition 5.14 we find that V1 is of
dimension 276 and the Killing form κ(· , ·) on V1 satisfies κ(· , ·) = 44h · | · i. In
particular, the Killing form is non-degenerate, and V1 is a semi-simple Lie algebra.
    Suppose then that g is a simple component of V1 with level k and dual coxeter
number h. By the main theorem of [DM06] we have that k is an integer. Suppose
that (· , ·) is the bilinear form on g normalized so that (α, α) = 2 for a long root
α. Then we have hu|vi = k(u, v) for u, v ∈ g, and thus also κ(u, v) = 44k(u, v) for
u, v ∈ g. Taking u = v = α we obtain h/k = 22 since κ(α, α) = 4h. This argument
is independent of the choice of simple component and so the ratio h/k must hold
for each simple component. By inspection the only possibility then is that g is of
type D12 with level k = 1.
    Thus we find that V1 is a semisimple Lie algebra of type D12 , and the VOA
V0̄ is isomorphic to the lattice VOA VM0 for M0 a copy of the D12 lattice. It
follows then that the SVOA V is isomorphic to a lattice VOA VM for some positive
definite integral lattice M = M0 ∪ M1 . Since V is self-dual of rank 12, M is self-
dual of rank 12, and the fact that V1/2 = 0 implies that M has no vectors of unit
                                                                               +
length. There is one such lattice up to isomorphism; namely, the lattice D12     . We
conclude that any self-dual nice rational SVOA with rank 12 and trivial degree 1/2
                                                                       +
subspace is isomorphic to VM , where M is a copy of the lattice D12      . From the
                                                      f♮
proof of Proposition 4.1 we see that the SVOA C A is also such an object, and
this completes the proof of the theorem.                                            
Remark 5.16. We sketch here an alternative approach to Theorem 5.15 that was
described to us by Gerald Höhn. Suppose that V is as in the statement of Theo-
rem 5.15, and let us write U0 for a copy of the lattice VOA associated to the lattice
of type D4 . This VOA has three irreducible modules beyond itself; we pick one of
them and denote it U1 . We then set W = U0 ⊗ V0̄ ⊕ U1 ⊗ V1̄ , so that W is a module
for the VOA U0 ⊗ V0̄ with only integral weights. Using knowledge of the fusion of
modules for V0̄ and U0 it can be shown that the VOA structure extends in a unique
way from U0 ⊗ V0̄ to the whole space. Then W is a self-dual VOA of rank 16, and
one may invoke Theorem 2 of [DM04a] to conclude that W is a lattice VOA WL for
                                                                       +
L one of the two self-dual lattices of rank 16; namely, E8 ⊕ E8 or D16   . One then
shows that the D4 lattice VOA U0 can only be embedded in WL in such a way that
V0 must also be a lattice VOA, and the lattice must be of type D12 .

5.2. N = 1 structure. We now wish to demonstrate that the N = 1 structure on
Af ♮ is unique. More precisely, suppose that t ∈ CM(l)0G satisfies heS t, ti = 0 for
any S ⊂ Ω with 0 < w(S) ≤ 4. Citing Proposition 4.3 as justification, we call such
a vector superconformal. We wish to show that if t is superconformal with |t| = 1
then t = x1G for some x ∈ Spin(l). This will be achieved in Theorem 5.28, after we
establish a few preliminary lemmas. For the benefit of the reader we now include
a few words about the idea behind the proof of this theorem.

5.2.1. Strategy. Our strategy is the following. Suppose that t ∈ CM(l)0G is a su-
perconformal vector of unit norm, and define a function ft : Spin(l) → [−1, 1] by
ft (x) = hx1G , ti. Since the bilinear form on CM(l)0G is non-degenerate we are done
as soon as we find an x ∈ Spin(l) such that ft (x) = 1. We will show that for any
x ∈ Spin(l) with ft (x) < 1 there exists some x′ ∈ Spin(l) such that ft (x′ ) > ft (x).
The function f is certainly continuous and Spin(l) is compact, so showing that ft
can always be made closer to 1 suffices to show that ft attains the value 1. In fact,
since xt is superconformal for x ∈ Spin(l) whenever t is, it suffices to show only that
for any superconformal t there is some x ∈ Spin(l) such that ft (x) > ft (1) where
1 denotes the identity in Spin(l). Thus the following results up to and including
Theorem 5.28 are dedicated to showing that for any superconformal t in CM(l)0G
there is some x ∈ Spin(l) such that hx1G , ti > h1G , ti.
    We next recall some facts about the Golay co-code, and then introduce some
useful notation and terminology before presenting Propositions 5.18 and 5.20, which
will be the main tools we use to implement the stated strategy. A superconformal
vector t may be regarded as an element of the unit ball in 2048 dimensional space,
and Proposition 5.18 provides a way of regarding t as an element of the unit ball
in 2048/|Γ| dimensional space via a kind of linearization over the cosets of certain
subgroups Γ < G ∗ . The Proposition 5.20 is a generalization of this result which
arises essentially because G ∗ has many distinct lifts to FΩ2 . We sometimes refer to
Propositions 5.18 and 5.20 as the coset contraction results.

5.2.2. Golay co-code. Recall that the Golay co-code is the space G ∗ = FΩ       2 /G, and
recall the co-weight function w∗ on FΩ   2 from §1.1. We write X 7→ X̄ for the canonical
                 ∗
map FΩ  2 → G . The Golay code corrects three errors and the range of the co-weight
function is the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Let X ∈ FΩ 2 . We say that X and X̄ are co-even if
2|w∗ (X), and we say that X and X̄ are doubly co-even if 4|w∗ (X).
   If w∗ (X) = 2 then there is a unique pair of points i, j ∈ Ω such that X + G =
{ij} + G. If w(X) = w∗ (X) = 4 then there are exactly five weight 8 words (octads)
in G containing X, and we have w(Y ) = w∗ (Y ) = 4 and X̄ = Ȳ just when X + Y
is one of these. Thus for X̄ ∈ G ∗ with w∗ (X) = 4, the six sets of cardinality four in
FΩ2 that lift X̄ constitute a partition of Ω into six disjoint four sets. Such a partition
is called a sextet, and the four sets in a given sextet are called tetrads.
   Let T̄ , T̄ ′ ∈ G ∗ with co-weight 4, and let S = {Ti } and S ′ = {Ti′ } be the sextets
determined by T̄ and T̄ ′ respectively. Then there are essentially four different ways
that the sextets S and S ′ can overlap.
     (1)   |Ti ∩ Tj′ | ∈ {0, 4} for all i, j.
     (2)   |Ti ∩ Tj′ | ∈ {0, 1, 3} for all i, j.
     (3)   |Ti ∩ Tj′ | ∈ {0, 1, 2} for all i, j.
     (4)   |Ti ∩ Tj′ | ∈ {0, 2} for all i, j.
           SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                         33


The first case is just the case that S and S ′ are the same sextet. The second case
is the case that T̄ + T̄ ′ has co-weight 2. In the third and fourth cases T̄ + T̄ ′ has
co-weight 4, and the last case is distinguished by the property that any lift of the
set {T̄ , T̄ ′ } is isotropic. We refer to the sextets S and S ′ as commuting sextets when
|Ti ∩ Tj′ | is even for all i and j, and we refer to them as non-commuting otherwise.
In this setting, we refer to tetrads T0 and T0′ as commuting when the corresponding
sextets {Ti } and {Ti′ } are commuting, and we refer to them as non-commuting
otherwise.

                                                                             ∗
5.2.3. Co-code lifts. Let ∆ be a subset of FΩ                          Ω
                                              2 such that the map F2 → G induces
                   ¯                                               ¯     Ω
a bijection ∆ ↔ ∆ = {X̄ | X ∈ ∆}. We then call ∆ a lift of ∆ to F2 . If further
we have that w(X) = w∗ (X) for all X ∈ ∆, we say that ∆ is a balanced lift of
¯ Recall that the space FΩ
∆.                                                       Ω     Ω
                             2 admits a bilinear form F2 × F2 → F2 defined so that
hX, Y i = |X ∩ Y | (mod 2). In some cases a subset ∆  ¯ < G ∗ has a lift ∆ ⊂ FΩ such
                                                                                2
that hX, Y i ≡ 0 for any X, Y ∈ ∆, and we call such a lift isotropic. Suppose that
∆ is doubly co-even and balanced. We then say that ∆ is commuting if the sextets
determined by any pair of tetrads in ∆ are commuting in the sense of §5.2.2.
   Suppose now that Σ is a balanced lift of (G ∗ )0 , the even part of G ∗ . Then the
set Σ is in natural bijective correspondence with (G ∗ )0 , and the group structure on
the later may be lifted via this correspondence so as to define a group structure on
the former. We denote this group operation with ∔, so that X ∔ Y = Z just when
X + Y + Z ∈ G. Note that the bilinear form on FΩ    2 is not bilinear with respect to
∔, so that in general hA ∔ B, Xi =  6 hA, Xi + hB, Xi for example. A multiplicative
2-cocycle σ with values in {±1} is defined on the group Σ = (Σ, ∔) by requiring
that eX eY 1G = σ(X, Y )eX∔Y 1G for X, Y ∈ Σ.

Proposition 5.17. We have
                                                   ∗
(5.2.1)                         σ(X, X) = (−1)w        (X)/2


(5.2.2)                      σ(X, Y ) = (−1)hX,Y i σ(Y, X)
(5.2.3)                    σ(X, Y ) = σ(X, X)σ(X, X ∔ Y )

for all X, Y ∈ Σ. In particular σ(X, Y ) = σ(X, X ∔ Y ) for all Y ∈ Σ just when X
is doubly co-even.

Proof. For any X, Y ∈ Σ we have eX eY 1G = (−1)hX,Y i eY eX 1G , and this im-
plies σ(X, Y ) = (−1)hX,Y i σ(Y, X). Left multiplying both sides of eX eY 1G =
σ(X, Y )eX∔Y 1G by eX yields σ(X, Y )eX eX∔Y 1G = e2X eY 1G . On the other hand
eX eX∔Y 1G = σ(X, X ∔ Y )eY 1G . Since e2X = σ(X, X), this verifies the claim. 

   When Σ is a lift of (G ∗ )0 , the set {e X 1G |X ∈ Σ} constitutes an orthonormal
                0

P 2   for CM(l) G . We   then   have t =     Σ tX eX 1G for unique tX ∈ R such that
   tX = 1 when t is a unit vector in CM(l)0G . Note that ft (1) = t∅ . We write
supp(t) for the set of X̄ ∈ G ∗ such that tX 6= 0.
   One way to obtain a balanced lift of (G ∗ )0 is the following. Choose an element in
Ω and denote it by ∞. Let ∆ = ∆0 ∪ ∆2 ∪ ∆4 where ∆0 contains just the emptyset,
∆2 is the set of pairs of elements from Ω, and ∆4 is the set of subsets of Ω of size
four containing ∞. Then ∆ is a balanced lift of (G ∗ )0 . A doubly co-even subgroup
Γ < ∆ is then isotropic just when it is commuting.

5.2.4. Coset contraction. Let Σ be a balanced lift of (G ∗ )0 , suppose that Γ̄ is a
subgroup of G ∗ , and suppose that W ∈ Σ is chosen so that the coset W̄ + Γ̄ of Γ̄ in
G ∗ is doubly co-even. Suppose also that the corresponding lift W ∔ Γ ⊂ Σ obtained
by restriction from Σ is isotropic. Then the 2-cocycle σ is symmetric on W ∔ Γ.
Let χ : Σ → ±1 be a function such that
(5.2.4)     χ(A ∔ W )σ(A ∔ W, Z) = χ(Z)χ(A ∔ W ∔ Z),             ∀A ∈ Γ, Z ∈ Σ.
Then by Proposition 5.17 we have σ(A ∔ W, Z) = σ(A ∔ W, A ∔ W ∔ Z) so that
the invariance under swapping Z with A ∔ W ∔ Z is evident for both sides of the
expression (5.2.4). The assumption that W ∔ Γ be isotropic ensures that (5.2.4)
can be satisfied for Z in W ∔ Γ.
   In the case that W ∔ Γ = Γ the condition (5.2.4) implies that the restriction χ|Γ
of χ to Γ is a 1-cocycle with coboundary σ|Γ×Γ since we have σ(A∔B, A) = σ(A, B)
for A, B ∈ Γ when Γ is isotropic. The values of χ on a coset Z ∔ Γ of Γ in Σ are
determined by those on Γ together with χ(Z) since χ(Z ∔ A) = χ(A)σ(A, Z)/χ(Z).
Any two such functions χ : Σ → ±1 therefore differ by a single element of Γ∗ =
Hom(Γ, ±1) on each coset of Γ in Σ. Recall that the maps X̄ 7→ (−1)hD,Xi for
D ∈ G exhaust the homomorphisms G ∗ → ±1. Indeed, (−1)hD,Xi is independent
of the choice of lift X for X̄, and thus any homomorphism (Σ, ∔) → ±1 is of the
form X 7→ (−1)hD,Xi for some D ∈ G.
   To a functionP   χ satisfying (5.2.4) and to any given Z ∈ Σ we associate the
element uχ,Z = A∈Γ χ(Z ∔ A)eZ∔A in Cliff(l), and for ease of notation we set
uχ = uχ,∅ . The following proposition is our main tool for classifying superconformal
vectors in CM(l)0G .
                                P
Proposition 5.18. Let t = Σ tX eX 1G be superconformal with |t| = 1. Let Γ̄ be a
subgroup of G ∗ and suppose that W̄ ∈ G ∗ is chosen so that W̄ + Γ̄ is doubly co-even.
Suppose also that W ∔ Γ ⊂ Σ is an isotropic lift of W̄ + Γ̄. Then for χ : Σ → ±1
satisfying (5.2.4) and for T any transversal of Γ in Σ we have
                                                                  (
                 X                                                  1 if W ∈ Γ,

                                                                           / Γ.
In particular, for
                P the case that supp(t) is a doubly co-even group with an isotropic
lift Γ we have A∈Γ χ(A)tA = ±1 for any 1-cocycle χ : Γ → ±1 with coboundary
σ|Γ×Γ .
Proof. Let us consider the expression huχ t, ti. Since t is superconformal, we have
heX t, ti = 0 whenever w(X) < 8, so that huχ t, ti = χ(∅)ht, ti = 1. On the other
hand we have
                             X
                     uχ t =         χ(A)tZ eA eZ 1G

                          =             χ(Z)χ(Z ∔ A)tZ eZ∔A 1G

                       P
P then 1 = huχ t, ti = χ(Z)χ(Z ∔ A)tZ tZ∔A . From the fact that huχ,Z 1G , ti =
and
  A∈Γ χ(Z ∔ A)tZ∔A we see that the left hand side of (5.2.5) coincides with huχ t, ti,
and the equation (5.2.5) follows. This handles the case that W ∈ Γ, and the

 P that W ∈
case        / Γ is similar. The case that all tX vanish for X ∈
                                                              / Γ then yields
( Σ χ(X)tX )2 = 1, and the last part follows from this.                    
   Suppose that Σ and Σ′ are balanced lifts of G ∗ to FΩ              2 . We denote the group
operations on Σ and Σ′ both by ∔. There is a correspondence Σ ↔ Σ′ such that
we have X ↔ X ′ if and only if X̄ = X̄ ′ ∈ G ∗ . We then have X ∔ Y = Z in Σ
just when X ′ ∔ Y ′ = Z ′ in Σ′ . For X ∈ Σ we have hX, X ′ i = 0 and X + X ′ ∈ G.
Define ̺ : G ∗ → ±1 so that ̺X̄ eX eX ′ 1G = 1G . We abuse notation to write ̺X for
̺X̄ whenever X ∈ Σ. Let σ ′ denote the multiplicative 2-cocycle on (Σ′ , ∔) such
that eX ′ eY ′ 1G = σ ′ (X ′ , Y ′ )eZ ′ 1G for Z ′ = X ′ ∔ Y ′ . The following lemma gives the
relationship between σ and σ ′ .
Lemma 5.19. For X, Y ∈ Σ and Z = X ∔ Y we have
                                                    ′
(5.2.7)               σ ′ (X ′ , Y ′ ) = (−1)hX+X       ,Y i
                                                               ̺X ̺Y ̺Z σ(X, Y )
    As before we assume that W ∔ Γ is doubly co-even and isotropic, and we assume
now the same for W ′ ∔ Γ′ . We also assume that hX ′ , Y i = hX, Y ′ i for all X, Y ∈
W ∔ Γ. Given χ : Σ → ±1 satisfying (5.2.4), we define χ′ : Σ′ → ±1 by setting
χ′ (X ′ ) = ψ(X)χ(X) for X ′ ∈ Σ′ where ψ : Σ → ±1 is chosen to satisfy
                           ′
(5.2.8) ψ(X)(−1)hX+X           ,Zi
                                     ̺X ̺Z ̺X∔Z = ψ(Z)ψ(X ∔ Z),              ∀X ∈ W ∔ Γ, Z ∈ Σ.
Then from Lemma 5.19 we obtain that χ′ (X ′ )σ ′ (X ′ , Z ′ ) = χ′ (Z ′ )χ′ (X ′ ∔ Z ′ ) when-
ever X ′ ∈ W ′ ∔ Γ′ and Z ′ ∈ Σ′ . Now we may apply Proposition 5.18 with Σ′ in
place of Σ, and χ′ in place of χ, and we obtain the following generalization of that
proposition.
Proposition 5.20. Let Σ, Σ′ be balanced lifts of G ∗ , and suppose that Γ < Σ and
W ∈ Σ are chosen so that both W ∔ Γ and W ′ ∔ Γ′ are doubly co-even and isotropic.
Suppose also that hX ′ , Y i = hX, Y ′ i for all X, Y ∈ W ∔ Γ. Then for χ : Σ → ±1
satisfying (5.2.4), for ψ : Σ → ±1 satisfying (5.2.8), and for T a transversal of Γ
in Σ, we have

where χ′′P: Σ → ±1 is given by χ′′ (X) = ̺X ψ(X)χ(X), and uχ′′ ,Z is defined by
uχ′′ ,Z = A∈Γ χ′′ (A ∔ Z)eA∔Z for Z ∈ Σ.
5.2.5. Superconformal vectors. We now embark upon the task of realizing the strat-
egy summarized in §5.2.1; that is, the task of showing that for any superconformal
t ∈ CM(l)0G there is some x in Spin(l) such that ft (x) > t∅ . In practice, we treat
all possible unit vectors t on a case by case basis using the cosetP contraction results
to narrow down the possibilities for the coefficients tX of t = Σ tX eX 1G (given
a balanced lift Σ of (G ∗ )0 to FΩ2 ) that can make t superconformal. In the course
of doing so we find superconformal vectors in the Spin(l) orbit of 1G other than
those of the form ±eX 1G for X ∈ FΩ    2 , or exp(reX )1G for r ∈ R and w(X) = 2, and
ultimately we find that t either has projection on one of these vectors exceeding t∅
or cannot be superconformal.
   Suppose that |tX | > t∅ for some X ∈ Σ. Then we have hx1G , ti = σ(X, X)tX for
x = eX . Multiplying by −1 if necessary, we have ft (x) > t∅ . Thus from now on we
may suppose that t∅ ≥ |tX | for all X ∈ Σ.

    Suppose that tX 6= 0 for some X with w∗ (X) = 2. Setting exp(reX ) = cos(r) +
sin(r)eX we have h exp(reX )1G , ti = (1 − 12 r2 )t∅ − rtX + o(r2 ) so that ft (x) > t∅
for x = exp(reX ) and suitably chosen r. From now on we assume that tX = 0
whenever w∗ (X) = 2. That is we may assume that supp(t) is a doubly co-even
subset of G ∗ .
    Suppose that supp(t) is contained in a doubly co-even subgroup Γ̄ of G ∗ and
suppose that Γ̄ has a balanced isotropic lift Γ. We may assume that Σ is a balanced
lift of (G ∗ )0 containing Γ. Since it is useful, we now state the following result, which
is obtained by direct application of Proposition 5.20 to our present situation.
Proposition 5.21. Let Γ̄ be a doubly co-even subgroup of G ∗ and suppose that Γ
and Γ′ are balanced isotropic lifts of Γ̄ such that hA′ , Bi = hA, B ′ i for all A, B ∈ Γ.
Then for χ : Γ → ±1 a 1-cocycle with coboundary σ|Γ×Γ , and for ψ : Γ → ±1
satisfying
                                   ′
(5.2.10)           ψ(A)(−1)hA+A ,Bi ̺A ̺B ̺A∔B = ψ(B)ψ(A ∔ B)
                                         2
                         huχ′′ 1G , ti = 1 where χ′′ : Γ → ±1 is given by χ′′ (A) =
for all A, B ∈ Γ we have P
̺A ψ(A)χ(A), and uχ′′ = A∈Γ χ′′ (A)eA .
    The requirement that Γ̄ be doubly co-even is quite strong. Any maximal doubly
co-even subgroup of G ∗ has order 16 or 32, and every doubly co-even subgroup of
order 16 or less has an isotropic lift. A convenient way to generate doubly co-even
subgroups of G ∗ is the following. Choose a weight 12 word in G (a dodecad), and
partition the 12 non-zero coordinates into six pairs {Ai }. Then the 15 elements
Āi + Āj ∈ G ∗ are the non-trivial elements in a doubly co-even subgroup Γ̄ say, of
G ∗ of order 16. Furthermore, the set {∅, Ai + Aj } furnishes a balanced isotropic
lift of Γ. For some partitions there is a sextet S = {Ti } such that each pair Ai is
contained in a tetrad of S. In this case, the addition of one of the Ti extends Γ to
be a balanced isotropic lift of a doubly co-even 32 group in G ∗ .
    Suppose then that supp(t) is contained in a two group Γ̄ with balanced lift
Γ = {∅, A}. Then since t is a unit vector we have t2∅ + t2A = 1. On the other
hand from Proposition 5.21 we have (t∅ ± tA )2 = 1 and thus t∅ + tA = ±1 and
t∅ − tA = ±1. The only solutions are t∅ = ±1 and tA = ±1. Since we have assumed
t∅ ≥ |tX | for all X ∈ Σ, we have t∅ = 1 and t = 1G .
    Suppose now that supp(t) is contained in a four group Γ̄ with balanced isotropic
lift Γ = {∅, A, B, C}. Similar to before we have t2∅ + t2A + t2B + t2C = 1. A
function χ0 : Γ → ±1 suitable for an application of Proposition 5.21 may be
given arbitrary values on generators of Γ, and then the remaining values are de-
termined by σ. For example, we may set χ0 (∅) = χ0 (A) = χ0 (B) = 1 and
χ0 (C) = σ(A, B)χ0 (A)χ0 (B) = σ(A, B). Any other suitable 1-cocycle χ differs
from χ0 by some element of Γ∗ , and Proposition 5.21 (with Σ′ = Σ) now yields
(5.2.11)           t∅ + µ(A)tA + µ(B)tB + σ(A, B)µ(C)tC = ±1
where µ is any homomorphism µ : Γ → ±1. Summing over (5.2.11) for various
choices of µ we find that tX ± tY ∈ {0, ±1} for each X, Y ∈ Γ, and then tX ∈
{0, ± 21 , ±1} for each X ∈ Γ. Thus if one of the tX vanishes then the remaining
tY must lie in {0, ±1}, and then t = ±tY for some Y ∈ Γ. If one of the tX is
± 21 then the remaining tY must lie in ± 21 and there is some restriction on the
signs: any two solutions differ by an element of Γ∗ , and one solution is given by
s = 21 (1 + eA + eB − σ(A, B)eC )1G . Taking Σ′ different from Σ we can say more:
           SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                          37


if there is some lift Γ′ of Γ̄ such that hX ′ , Y i =
                                                    6 0 for some X, Y ∈ Γ, then we
obtain another equation like (5.2.11) with signs not differing by an element of Γ∗ ,
and this extra restriction is enough to rule out the possibility that any tX has norm
1                ′
2 . Such a lift Γ exists just when two of the sextets corresponding to {Ā, B̄, C̄}
are non-commuting (see §5.2.2). We are left with the question of whether of not a
vector s ∈ CM(l)0G of the form s = 21 (1 + µ(A)eA + µ(B)eB − σ(A, B)µ(C)eC )1G
with µ ∈ Γ∗ is in the Spin(l) orbit containing 1G given that the sextets in Γ̄ are
commuting. The answer is affirmative, as the following lemma demonstrates.
Lemma 5.22. Suppose Γ = {∅, A, B, C} is a balanced lift of a commuting four
group in G ∗ , and
                    1
(5.2.12)         s = (1 + µ(A)eA + µ(B)eB − σ(A, B)µ(C)eC ) 1G
                    2
for some µ ∈ Γ∗ . Then s is in the Spin(l) orbit containing 1G .
Proof. For S ∈ G let gS = ±eS with the sign chosen so that gS ∈ G. For any given
S ∈ G either hS, Xi = 0 for all X ∈ Γ, or there is a unique non-trivial X ∈ Γ
such that hS, Xi = 0. We define a group G′ = {gS′ | S ∈ G} < Spin(l) by setting
gS′ = sX eX gS when X is the unique non-trivial element of Γ such that hS, Xi = 0,
and setting gS′ = gS when hS, Xi = 0 for all X ∈ Γ. Then a simple computation
shows that gS′ s = s for all S ∈ G. The group G′ is an FE2 -homogeneous subgroup of
Spin(l) whose associated code is doubly-even self-dual and has no short roots. In
other words, G′ is a lift of a Golay code on Ω. Noting that both G and G′ contain
the volume element eΩ , It follows from the uniqueness of the Golay code that there
is some coordinate permutation in Spin(l) that sends s to 1G .                   
   The method illustrated above for the case that Γ̄ has order four is a model for
the cases of higher order. For this reason we will summarize only the results for
the higher order cases that we need, and refrain from burdening the reader with all
details.
Lemma 5.23. In the case that supp(t) is contained in an eight group Γ̄ with bal-
anced isotropic lift Γ = hA, B, Ci, either supp(t) is contained in a commutative four
group, or Γ is totally commutative and t is of the form
(5.2.13)
        1
    t=    (3 + µ(A)eA + µ(B)eB + µ(C)eC + µ(A ∔ B)σ(A, B)eA∔B + . . .) 1G
        4
for some µ ∈ Γ∗ , and t belongs to the Spin(l) orbit containing 1G .
Lemma 5.24. In the case that supp(t) is contained in a 16 group Γ̄ with balanced
isotropic lift Γ, either supp(t) is contained in some commutative eight group, or
there is a dodecad in G and a partition P of its non-trivial coordinates into six
pairs P = {A0 , . . . , A5 } such that Γ = {∅, Aij } where we write Aij for the tetrad
Ai + Aj ∈ FΩ  2 . We may assume that eA0 eA1 · · · eA5 ∈ G. Then σ(Aij , Aik ) = −1
and σ(Aij , Akl ) = 1 for distinct i, j, k, l. The vector t is then of the form
(5.2.14)
       1
  t = (1 + µ(A01 )eA01 + . . . + µ(A04 )eA04 − µ(A12 )eA12 − · · · − µ(A45 )eA45 ) 1G
       4
for some µ ∈ Γ∗ , and t belongs to the Spin(l) orbit containing 1G .

Lemma 5.25. In the case that supp(t) is contained in a 32 group with balanced
isotropic lift, either supp(t) is contained in some 16 group with isotropic lift, or
ft (x) > t∅ for x1G = s a superconformal vector with supp(s) contained in a doubly
co-even 16 group with isotropic lift.
   We must now treat the case that supp(t) is not contained in any doubly co-even
group with isotropic lift. We remind here that we assume t∅ ≥ |tX | for all X ∈ Σ,
and tX = 0 whenever w∗ (X) = 2. We claim that for such t, either ft (x) > t∅ for
some x1G = s with s supported on a doubly co-even group with isotropic lift as
given in Lemmata 5.22 through 5.24, or t is not superconformal.
   So let us assume that ft (x) ≤ t∅ for any x ∈ Spin(l) such that x1G = s for s
one of the superconformal vectors appearing in Lemmata 5.22 through 5.24. This
condition amounts to putting upper bounds on the moduli of the coefficients tX
that are non-zero. For example, take s and Γ as in Lemma 5.22. Then hs, ti ≤ t∅
for all µ ∈ Γ∗ is equivalent to the inequalities
                     1
(5.2.15)        0 ≤ (t∅ + µ(A)tA + µ(B)tB + µ(C)σ(A, B)tC ) , ∀µ ∈ Γ∗ ,
                     2
which in turn imply that the smallest of |tA |, |tB | and |tC | is not greater than 41 ,
given that all are non-zero. Also, one can construct elements x ∈ Spin(l) of the
form x = exp(θ1 eX1 ) · · · exp(θk eXk ) for w(Xi ) = 2 such that ft (x) > t∅ so long as
not all the non-vanishing tX in t are too small. On the other hand, Proposition 5.18
applied in the case that W ∈  / Γ can be used to show that the non-vanishing of some
co-weight 4 coefficients tX implies the non-vanishing of others. The simplest result
of this kind is the following.
Lemma 5.26. If tA 6= 0 then there is some B ∈ Σ such that tB tA∔B 6= 0.
Proof. We take Γ = {∅} and W = X in Proposition 5.18. We then obtain
                         X                              X
(5.2.16) 0 = heA t, ti =   htX eA eX 1G , ti = 2t∅ tA +   σ(A, X)tX tA∔X
                          X∈Σ                             X∈Σ\∅,A

and this implies the claim.                                                           
   We require to show then that the coefficients tX for w∗ (X) = 4 cannot all be
too small. Since some non-vanishing co-weight 4 components implies more non-
vanishing co-weight 4 components, let us consider the extreme case that tX 6= 0 for
all X ∈ Σ with w∗ (X) = 4. Suppose that tZ = ε is the greatest among these (we
may assume tZ > 0) so that ε ≥ |tX | for all X ∈ Σ with w∗ (X) = 4. Then since
   t2X = 1 we have t∅ > t2∅ > 1 − N ε2 where N = 1771 is the number of co-weight 4
P
elements in G ∗ . On the other hand Proposition 5.18 with Γ = ∅ and W = Z yields
0 = heZ t, ti, and we then have
(5.2.17)                 0 = heZ t, ti > 2(1 − N ε2 )ε − M ε2
where M is the number of X ∈ Σ with w∗ (X) = 4 such that w∗ (Z ∔ X) = 4. We
have 2(1 − N ε2 )ε − M ε2 > 0 (that is,√a contradiction) just when 2 > M ε + 2N ε2 ,
so that ε cannot be smaller than 1/ 2N for example. In this way we find that
any t which does not satisfy ft (x) > t∅ for some superconformal x1G = s already
constructed is not superconformal. That is, we have the following
Theorem 5.27. The superconformal vectors in CM(l)G form a single orbit under
the action of Spin(l). This orbit contains 1G .

  From Theorems 5.15 and 5.27 we deduce the following characterization of Af ♮ .
Theorem 5.28. Let V be a self-dual nice rational N = 1 SVOA with rank 12 and
V1/2 = 0. Then V is isomorphic to C Af ♮ as an N = 1 SVOA.
   For x ∈ Spin24 (R) let us write tr|24 x for the trace of x in the representation
of Spin24 (R) on R24 . We have tr|24 (eX ) = 24 − 2n when w(X) = n. Combining
Theorems 4.10 and 5.27 we obtain the following characterization of the group Co0 .
Theorem 5.29. Let M be a spin module for Spin24 (R) and let t ∈ M such that
hxt, ti = 0 whenever x ∈ Spin24 (R) is an involution with tr|24 x = 16. Then the
subgroup of Spin24 (R) fixing t is isomorphic to Co0 .

                               6. Structure of V f ♮
  In this section we summarize the construction of V f ♮ , mentioned in the intro-
duction, and we indicate how to construct an explicit isomorphism with Af ♮ .

6.1. Lattice N = 1 SVOAs. There is a standard construction which assigns an
N = 1 SVOA to a positive definite integral lattice, and we summarize that con-
struction now. Suppose that L is a positive definite integral lattice. Let F be R
or C, and recall from §2.7, the SVOA F VL associated to L via the standard con-
struction. Let F a = F ⊗Z L, and let us denote A(F a) by F AL . Define F VLf to be the
tensor product of SVOAs
                                    f
(6.1.1)                          F VL   = F AL ⊗ F VL

For F = C the SVOA C VLf admits a natural structure of N = 1 SVOA. To define
the superconformal element, let hi be an orthonormal basis of C h = C ⊗Z L and let
ei be the corresponding elements of C a under the identification C a = C h = C ⊗Z L.
Then we set τ to be the element in (C VLf )3/2 given by
                                 i X
(6.1.2)                      τ= √     ei (− 12 )hi (−1)1
                                  8 i

where we suppress the tensor product from our notation. From [KO03], [Sch98] for
example, we have the following

Theorem 6.1. The element τ is a superconformal vector for C VLf . In particular,
   f
C VL admits a natural structure of N = 1 SVOA.

   Just as in §2.7.2 we can obtain a real form VLf for C VLf by setting VLf = R AL ⊗VL .
Noting that ihi (−1) ∈ iR VL1 ⊂ VL we see that τ ∈ VLf , and the N = 1 structure on
    f                                                       f
C VL restricts so as to furnish an N = 1 structure on VL .
   For simplicity, let us suppose that the rank of L is even. By the Boson-Fermion
correspondence [Fre81], [DM94], we have an isomorphism of SVOAs C AL ∼           = C VZn
where n = rank(L)/2, so that C AL is self-dual as an SVOA. The tensor product C VLf
is therefore isomorphic to a lattice SVOA C VZn ⊕L . The lattice Zn ⊕ L is self-dual
just when L is, so we conclude that the N = 1 SVOA associated to any self-dual
lattice is self-dual as an SVOA. More generally, the irreducible C VLf modules are
indexed by the cosets of L in its dual.
40                                 JOHN F. DUNCAN


6.2. The case that L = E8 . From now on we take L be a lattice of E8 type so
that C VLf is a realization of the N = 1 SVOA associated to the E8 lattice. Since
L is a self-dual lattice, C VLf is a self-dual N = 1 SVOA. The idea is that the
N = 1 SVOA C V f ♮ should be a Z/2-orbifold of C VLf . More particularly, we wish
to define the space underlying C V f ♮ to be (C VLf )0 ⊕ (C VLf )0θ where θ is a suitably
chosen involution on C VLf , the space (C VLf )θ is an θ-twisted C VLf -module, and the
superscripts outside the brackets indicate θ-fixed points. In order to construct C V f ♮
we must therefore specify the involution θ, and construct a θ-twisted module. This
will be the objective of the next two subsections.
6.3. Twisting. The SVOA C VLf admits an automorphism θ given by θ = θf ⊗ θb
where θf denotes the parity involution on C AL , and θb denotes a lift of −1 on L to
Aut(C VL ). Observe that both θf and θb may be regarded as a lift of −1 on L. We
have θ(τV ) = τV , so θ is an automorphism of the N = 1 structure on C VLf . Also,
the real form of C VLf is just
                         n                                   o
(6.3.1)          VLf = u + iv | u ∈ (R VLf )0 , v ∈ (R VLf )1 ⊂ C VLf

where F VLf = (F VLf )0 ⊕ (F VLf )1 indicates the decomposition into θ-eigenspaces.
  An θ-twisted C VLf -module (C VLf )θ is of the form
(6.3.2)                     (C VLf )θ = (C AL )θf ⊗ (C VL )θb
where (C AL )θf = A(C a)θf is a canonically twisted C AL -module and may be con-
structed as in §3.4, and (C VL )θb is a θb -twisted module over C VL . There is a well
known method for constructing θb -twisted C VL modules for θb a lift of −1 on L,
and one may refer to [FLM88] for a thorough treatment. It turns out that for the
case we are interested in there is a simpler approach using only modules over lattice
VOAs, and this in turn can be viewed from the point of view of Clifford module
SVOAs. Such an approach is convenient for our purpose.
   Recall that the lattice L contains a sublattice of the form K ⊕ K where K
is a lattice of D4 type. Let K ∗ denote the dual lattice to K, and let Kγ for
γ ∈ Γ = {0, 1, ω, ω̄} be an enumeration of the cosets of K in K ∗ . We decree that
K0 = K. The remaining cosets Kγ for γ 6= 0 are permuted by automorphisms of
K ∗ preserving K, and for this reason it is natural to regard Γ as aScopy of the field
of order 4. We may assume that the lattice L decomposes as L = Γ Kγ ⊕ Kγ into
cosets of K ⊕ K. Then the VOA C VL has a decomposition
                                       M
(6.3.3)                       C VL =        C VKγ ⊗ C VKγ
                                      γ∈Γ

The VOA C VK , being a VOA of D4 type, may be realized using Clifford module
SVOAs, and similarly for its modules C VKγ . In fact we may take C VK to be a copy
of A(C a)0 , and then                                        0
                      L
                        Γ C VKγ is isomorphic as an A(C a) -module to the space
A(C a) ⊕ A(C a)θf .
   The corresponding construction of C VL , using A(C a)0 -modules in place of C VK -
modules, was achieved in [FFR91]. Indeed, they provided more than this, describ-
ing certain twisted modules over C VL and proving that the direct sum of these
twisted and untwisted structures may be equipped with a certain generalization of
VOA structure; namely para-VOA structure. It turns out that the twisting invo-
lutions considered in [FFR91] are conjugate to the involution θb under the action
           SUPER-MOONSHINE FOR CONWAY’S LARGEST SPORADIC GROUP                                                 41


of Aut(C VL ) ∼
              = E8 (C), and in particular, we may use one of these in place of θb .
Before describing precisely the involution we will use, we set up some new notation,
and recall the relevant results of [FFR91].

6.4. Clifford construction of C VL . Recall that F a = F ⊗Z L for F = R or C.
The extended Hamming code is the unique up to equivalence doubly-even self-dual
code of length 8. Let Π be some set of cardinality 8, and let H be a copy of the
extended Hamming code, which we regard at once as a subset of P(Π), and as a
subspace of FΠ2 . Let E = {ei }i∈Π be an orthonormal basis for R a ⊂ C a, and let H
be an FE2 -homogeneous lift of H to Spin(R a). We may then realize an θf -twisted
A(F a)-module explicitly by setting A(F a)θf = A(F a)θf ,H . We define F U0 to be the
VOA A(F a)0 and we enumerate the F U0 -modules F Uγ for γ ∈ Γ by setting
(6.4.1)     F U0   = A(F a)0 ,       F U1   = A(F a)1 ,         F Uω   = A(F a)0θf ,   F Uω̄   = A(F a)1θf .
Then C U0 is isomorphic   Lto the D4 lattice VOA, and the C Uγ are its irreducible
modules. We set F U = γ∈Γ F Uγ . From [FFR91] we have C U0 -module intertwining
operators Iγδ : C Uγ ⊗ C Uδ → C Uγ+δ ((z 1/2 )) such that the map I = (Iγδ ) : C U ⊗
              1/2
C U → C U ((z     )) furnishes C U with a structure of para-VOA. We refer the reader
to [FFR91] for detailed information about para-VOAs, and we note here that the

    For k ∈ {1, 2, 3} let F ak be a copy of the space F a with orthonormal basis E k =

The main result from [FFR91] that we will use is that the para-VOA structure on
C U induces a VOA structure on C WL isomorphic to C VL , and induces a structure of
θb′ -twisted C WL -module on C WL′ , where θb′ = 1 ⊗ θf . Furthermore, we may assume
that the isomorphism is chosen so that the action of θb′ on C WL corresponds to
that of θb on C VL . Indeed, a Cartan subalgebra of C (WL )1 is spanned by the
ie2i (− 12 )e3i (− 12 ) for i ∈ Π, and θb′ acts as −1 on this space.
     From now on we will regard the VOAs C WL and C VL as identified via some
VOA isomorphism such that θb corresponds to θb′ , and we will write C VL in place
of C WL and θb in place of θb′ . Then for a θb -twisted C VL -module we may take
(C VL )θb = C WL′ . Note that θb acts naturally on the θb -twisted       module (C VL )θb . A
real form VL for C VL may be described by VL = R WL = Γ R Uγ2 ⊗ R Uγ3 .
                                                                   L

     We may now express the spaces C VLf and (C VLf )θ in the following way as sums
of tensor products of the C Uγk .
                                                                       !

We obtain real forms VLf and (VLf )θ by replacing C with R in the subscripts of all
the C Uγk . Note that the super-conformal element τV ∈ C VLf may now be written in
42                                         JOHN F. DUNCAN


the following form.
                                    1 X 1 1 2 1 3 1

Remark 6.2. One can see that the Clifford module SVOA A(u) has an N = 1
structure whenever dim(u) is divisible by 3.
     We now define the space C V f ♮ and its real form V f ♮ as follows.
(6.4.6)            CV
                        f♮
                             = (C VLf )0 ⊕ (C VLf )0θ ,        V f ♮ = (VLf )0 ⊕ (VLf )0θ .

Then in terms of the F Uγk we have
                             M                                         M
                      f♮
(6.4.7)           CV     =                      C U γ1 γ2 γ3   ⊕                C U γ1 γ2 γ3
                                     k ∈{0,ω}
                                    γP                              k ∈{1,ω̄}
                                                                   γP
                                        γk =0                          γk =1

where we use an abbreviated notation to write C Uγ1 γ2 γ3 for C Uγ11 ⊗ C Uγ22 ⊗ C Uγ33 ,
and there is a similar expression for the real form V f ♮ obtained by replacing C with
R in the subscripts of the C Uγk . By a similar argument to that used in [FFR91] to
equip C WL with VOA structure via the para-VOA structure on C U , one may also
equip the spaces C V f ♮ and V f ♮ with N = 1 SVOA structure. Since our main focus
is to study the N = 1 SVOA V f ♮ via its realization Af ♮ , we omit a verification of
this claim and proceed directly to the task of indicating how one may arrive at an
N = 1 SVOA isomorphism between V f ♮ and Af ♮ .

6.5. Isomorphism. We will concentrate on finding a correspondence between the
real N = 1 SVOAs V f ♮ and Af ♮ . Recall that V f ♮ may be described as follows.
                            M                        M
                 V f♮ =            R U γ1 γ2 γ3 ⊕            R U γ1 γ2 γ3
(6.5.1)                  γk ∈{0,ω}                γk ∈{1,ω̄}
                                    P                              P
                                        γk =0                          γk =1

On the other hand, the space underlying Af ♮ is described as A(l)0 ⊕ A(l)0θ where l
is real vector
          L space      of dimension 24, and in particular, for a suitable identification
                k                                         1 0            2 0 3 0
of l with L  R a , we may identify R U000 = A(R a ) ⊗ A(R a ) ⊗ A(R a ) with a sub
space of A( R a ) = A(l) . As a sum of modules over this subVOA Af ♮ admits
                   k 0          0

the following description.
                              M                        M
                                     R U γ1 γ2 γ3 ⊕            R U γ1 γ2 γ3
(6.5.2)                    γk ∈{0,1}                γk ∈{ω,ω̄}
                               P                          P
                                   γk =0                       γk =ω

Thus it is evident that our method of constructing V f ♮ has almost delivered us an
isomorphism with Af ♮ already. We require to find some way of interchanging 1 with
ω in the subscripts on the right hand side of (6.5.1), and to do so we will invoke the
results of [FFR91] once more. It is well known that the type D4 Lie algebra admits
an S3 group of outer automorphisms that has the effect of permuting transitively
the three inequivalent irreducible non-adjoint D4 modules. As shown in [FFR91]
this action extends to the corresponding VOA modules, and applying the outer
automorphism that preserves the spaces U0 and Uω̄ , and interchanges U1 with Uω
simultaneously to each tensor factor on the right hand side of (6.5.1), we obtain an

                                                    ′
isomorphism of V f ♮ with an N = 1 SVOA V f ♮ whose underlying R U000 -module
structure is as in (6.5.2).
                         ′  M                  M
(6.5.3)              V f♮ =     R U γ1 γ2 γ3 ⊕   R U γ1 γ2 γ3
                              k ∈{0,1}
                             γP                   k ∈{ω,ω̄}
                                                 γP
                                 γk =0               γk =ω
                                         ′
We have seen that the   L spaces (V f ♮N)0̄ and (Af ♮ )0̄ are isomorphic VOAs due to the
                              k                  k
fact that A(l) = A( k R a ) and           k A(R a ) are naturally isomorphic. Similarly,
      ′
(V f ♮ )1̄ is naturally isomorphic to a canonically-twisted A(l)-module, and the same
                                                                         ′
is true for (Af ♮ )1̄ by construction. The difference between (V f ♮ )1̄ and (Af ♮ )1̄ is
that the former may be naturally identified with the A(l)0 -module A(l)0θ,H̃ where
H̃ is an FE2 -homogeneous lift of a direct sum of three copies of the Hamming code
H⊕3 , and the later is realized as a the A(l)0 -module A(l)0θ,G for G a lift of the Golay
code G. Canonically twisted modules over A(l) are unique up to isomorphism, so
                               ′
we can be assured that (V f ♮ )1̄ and (Af ♮ )1̄ are isomorphic as A(l)0 -modules, and
                                                                           ′
the proof of Theorem 4.1 shows that the SVOA structures on V f ♮ and Af ♮ are
essentially unique.
                                                                                        ′
   What is perhaps not so clear is whether or not the N = 1 structures on V f ♮
and Af ♮ coincide. Recall the following description of the superconformal element
in V f ♮ .
                             1 X 1 1 2 1 3 1
(6.5.4)            τV = − √         ei (− 2 )ei (− 2 )ei (− 2 )1 ∈ R U111
                              8 Π
Since H may be defined as a quadratic residue code, it is convenient to take Π to
be the points of the projective line over F7 so that Π = {∞, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} say.
                                                       ′
Then we may choose the isomorphism V f ♮ → V f ♮ in such a way that the image
 ′            f ♮′
τV of τV in V      is the following.
                               1 X 1 2 3
(6.5.5)               τV′ = − √      ei∞ ei∞ ei∞ 1H̃ ∈ (A(l)0θ,H̃ )3/2
                                8 Π

On the other hand, the superconformal element in Af ♮ is given by τA = 1G ∈
(A(l)0θ,G )3/2 . The spaces (A(l)θ,H̃ )3/2 and (A(l)θ,G )3/2 are different realizations
of the spin module over Cliff(l), and we may assume that H̃ and G are FE2 -
homogeneous subgroups of Spin(l). In the notation of §3.3 the spaces (A(l)θ,H̃ )3/2
and (A(l)θ,G )3/2 are identified with CM(l)H̃ and CM(l)G , respectively. These two
modules are equivalent and irreducible as Cliff(l)-modules, and in particular, the
action of Cliff(l) on any non-zero vector generates the entire module in each case.
The vector τA = 1G in CM(l)G is determined by the property that g1G =     L1G for any
g ∈ G. It is a remarkable fact that the correspondence between l and k R ak may
be chosen in such a way that τV also satisfies the property gτV = τV for any g ∈ G.
Consequently we obtain explicit Cliff(l)-module and Spin(l)-module equivalences
between CM(l)H̃ and CM(l)G such that τV′ corresponds to τA . Using this isomor-
phism we can construct an explicit A(l)-module equivalence between A(l)θ,H̃ and
A(l)θ,G . This is the last piece of information needed to construct an isomorphism
                       ′
of N = 1 SVOAs V f ♮ → Af ♮ , and consequently we obtain
                                                                      ∼
Theorem 6.3. There is an isomorphism of N = 1 SVOAs V f ♮ −
                                                          → Af ♮ .

                            7. McKay–Thompson series
   In this section we consider the McKay–Thompson series associated to elements
of Co1 acting on Af ♮ .
7.1. Series via Af ♮ . Let g ∈ Co0 , and suppose that g m = 1. Then there are
                              Q that for det(g − x), the characteristic polynomial
unique integers pk for k|m such
of g, we have det(g − x) = k|m (1 − xk )pk . This data can be expressed using a
kind of formal permutation notation as k|m k pk , and this expression is called the
                                           Q

frame shape for g. Recall η(τ ), the Dedekind eta function (1.1.1), and let φ(τ ) be
the function on the upper half plane given by
                                                 ∞

                                Q

The group Co0 has unique up to equivalence irreducible representations of dimen-
sions 1, 24, 276, 2024 and 1771 [CCN+ 85]. With N any one of these numbers, we
write χN for the trace function χN : Co0 → C on an irreducible Co0 -module of di-
mension N . Let us also write χG for the trace function on the Co0 -module CM(l)G .
(Recall CM(l)0G = (Af ♮ )3/2 .) We have χG = χ1 + χ24 + χ276 + χ2024 + χ1771 , and
the following
Theorem 7.1. For ḡ ∈ Aut(Af ♮ ), let ±g be the preimages of ḡ in SO24 (R). Then

Proof. Suppose that g ∈ Co0 is of order m and has frame shape k|m k pk . Then
                                                                        Q

g −1 has the same frame shape. Let {fi }24  i=1 be a basis for C l = C ⊗R l consisting of
eigenvectors of g with eigenvalues {ξi }24i=1 . Then we have
                                     Y               Y

and we note also that k|m kpk = 24.
   Recall that Af ♮ may be described as Af ♮ = A(l)0 ⊕ A(l)0θ where A(l) is the
Clifford module SVOA associated to a 24-dimensional inner product space l, and
A(l)θ is a canonically twisted A(l)-module. It is not hard to derive the following
expressions for the trace of g on the complexified spaces C A(l) and C A(l)θ .

Substituting q for x in (7.1.4) and using the fact that i ξi = 1 we obtain

Then for tr|C A(l) (−g)q L(0)−c/24 for example, we have
                                            YY
         tr|C A(l) (−g)q L(0)−c/24 = q −1/2      (1 − ξi q n+1/2 )

(7.1.8)
                                                                                   
                                         Y                   Y
                                     =         q −kpk /48       (1 − (q k )n+1/2 )pk  = φg (τ )
                                         k|m                 n≥0

and similarly, we obtain tr|C A(l)θ (−g)q L(0)−c/24 = χG (−g)ηg (τ ). To compute the
traces of ḡ ∈ Co1 = Co0 /{±1} on A(l)0 we should average over the traces of
its preimages g and −g on A(l), and similarly for the trace of ḡ on A(l)0θ . This
completes the verification of (7.1.3).                                            
