                                             § 0.       Introduction
                                             In this article, we consider the existence problem of homomorphisms between generalized Verma
                                             modules, which are induced from one dimensional representations (such generalized Verma mod-
                                             ules are called scalar, cf. [Boe 1985]). Our main result is the classification of the homomorphisms
                                             between scalar generalized Verma modules with respect to the maximal parabolic subalgebras.
                                                 A sufficient condition for the existence of the homomorphisms between Verma modules is
                                             given by [Verma 1968]. Bernstein, I. M. Gelfand, and S. I. Gelfand proved the condition of
                                             Verma is also a necessary condition. ([Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand 1975])
                                                 Later, Lepowsky studied the problem for the generalized Verma modules. In particular, Lep-
                                             owsky ([Lepowsky 1975a]) solved the existence problem of nontrivial homomorphisms between
                                             scalar generalized Verma modules associated to the parabolic subalgebras which are the com-
                                             plexifications of the minimal parabolic subalgebras of real rank one simple Lie algebras (so-called
                                             the real rank one case).
                                                 Lepowsky also obtained a sufficient condition for the existence of the homomorphisms be-
                                             tween scalar generalized Verma modules associated to the complexification of the minimal
                                             parabolic subalgebras of (not necessarily rank one) real semisimple Lie algebras. His condi-
                                             tion is quite similar to that of Verma and he conjectured it is also a sufficient condition in the
                                             setting of complexified minimal parabolic algebras ([Lepowsky 1975b]).
                                                 Boe ([Boe 1985]) solved the existence problem in the case of parabolic subalgebras whose
                                             nilradical is commutative (so-called the Hermitian symmetric case).
                                                 The existence problem for maximal parabolic algebras is, in principle, reduced to the Kazdhan-
                                             Lusztig algorithm. Casian and Collingwood ([Casian-Collingwood 1987]) proposed a direct

method of computing the Kazdhan-Lusztig data involving the generalized Verma modules. Ap-
plying the Kazdhan-Lusztig algorithm works very well in some cases. The structures of the
(not necessarily scalar) generalized Verma modules in the real rank one case and in the Hermi-
tian symmetric case are studied precisely ([Boe-Collingwood 1985], [Boe-Enright-Shelton 1988],
[Collingwood-Irving-Shelton 1988]). Boe and Collingwood ([Boe-Collingwood 1990]) studied the
case that all the (not necessarily scalar) generalized Verma modules are multiplicity free. The
cases treated by Boe and Collingwood is more general than the real rank one case and the
Hermitian symmetric case (so-called the multiplicity free case). In that case, they studied the
structures of the (not necessarily scalar) generalized Verma modules precisely. In particular, they
solved the existence problem of the non-trivial homomorphisms for regular integral infinitesimal
characters in the multiplicity free case.
    However, I surmise it is not easy to give the explicit answer to the existence problem by the
Kazdhan-Lusztig algorithm in the general setting. Our central dogma is “Consider the most
singular parameter, then everything turns to be easy.” Our approach to the problem consists of
the following three main ingredients.
    (1) The translation principle
    The translation principle has a long history. In [Vogan 1988], Vogan proposed an idea on
translation principle in order to establish the irreducibility of a discrete series representation of
a semisimple symmetric space in some case. His idea is extremely useful for the study of the
existence problem. Depending Vogan’s idea, we formulated a version of translation principle in
[Matumoto 1993] Proposition 2.2.3. In some cases, this enable us to reduce the existence of a
non-trivial homomorphism to the most singular case in which the problem is often trivial.
    (2) Jantzen’s irreducibility criterion
    Applying a version of the translation principle, we can often reduce the nonexistence of
a non-trivial homomorphism to the irreducibility of a particular generalized Verma module.
In [Jantzen 1977], Jantzen gave a sufficient and necessary condition for the irreducibility of a
generated Verma module. His result is extremely useful for our purpose and we can establish
the nonexistence of nontrivial homomorphisms in many cases.
    (3) The Kazdhan-Lusztig theory ([Kazdhan-Lusztig 1979], [Brylinski-Kashiwara 1981],
[Beilinson-Bernstein 1993])
    Although we do not compute Kazdhan-Lusztig polynomials, the existence of the Kazdhan-
Lusztig algorithm plays an important role in our approach. The point is that the definition of
the Kazdhan-Lusztig polynomials only depends on Coxeter systems. In some cases, this enable
us to reduce the problem to that of a different maximal parabolic subalgebra of a different simple
Lie algebra, which is easier than the original problem.
    In the most of the cases we can solve the existence problem by the above three ideas. However,
in some cases we need extra arguments.
    This article consists of five sections.
    We fix notations and introduce some fundamental material in §1.
    In §2, we introduce sufficient conditions for the existence problem.
    In §3, we treat the case of the classical algebras. The type A case is in the Hermitian
symmetric case. So, we only consider the case of the type B,C, and D. The main theorems are
Theorem 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and 3.2.3.
    In §4, we treated the case of the exceptional algebras.
    In §5, using a comparison result, we explain how to construct a homomorphism between scalar
generalized Verma modules associated to a general parabolic subalgebra from a homomorphism


                                                 2
between scalar generalized Verma modules associated to a maximal parabolic subalgebra. We
call such a homomorphism an elementary homomorphism.
    I would like to propose:
    Working Hypothesis An arbitrary nontrivial homomorphism between scalar generalized
Verma modules is a composition of elementary homomorphisms.
    The working hypothesis in the case of the Verma modules is nothing but the result of
Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand. The first statement of the Lepowsky conjecture ([Lepowsky 1975b]
Conjecture 6.13) means that, in the case of complexified minimal parabolic subalgebras of real
semisimple Lie algebras, the above working hypothesis is affirmative.
    The result of this article solves the existence of edge-of-wedge type embeddings in the case
of the maximal parabolic subgroups of complex reductive groups ([Matumoto 2003]).

§ 1. Notations and Preliminaries
1.1   General notations
In this article, we use the following notations and conventions.
    As usual we denote the complex number field, the real number field, the ring of (rational)
                                                                                  1
integers,                                    1 by C, R, 	Z, and N respectively. 2 N means the
     n  and 	the set 1of non-negative integers
set 2  n ∈ N , and 2 + N means the set 2 + n n ∈ N . We denote by ∅ the empty set. For
any (non-commutative) C-algebra R, “ideal” means “2-sided ideal”, “R-module” means “left
R-module”, and sometimes we denote by 0 (resp. 1) the trivial R-module {0} (resp. C). Often,
we identify a (small) category and the set of its objects. Hereafter “dim” means the dimension
as a complex vector space, and “⊗” (resp. Hom) means the tensor product over C (resp. the
space of C-linear mappings), unless we specify. For a complex vector space V , we denote by V ∗
the dual vector space. For a, b ∈ C, “a 6 b” means that a, b ∈ R and a 6 b. We denote by A − B
the set theoretical difference. cardA means the cardinality of a set A.

1.2   Notations for reductive Lie algebras
Let g be a complex reductive Lie algebra, U (g) the universal enveloping algebra of g, and h a
Cartan subalgebra of g. We denote by ∆ the root system with respect to (g, h). We fix some
positive root system ∆+ and let Π be the set of simple roots. Let W be the Weyl group of the
pair (g, h) and let h , i be a non-degenerate invariant bilinear form on g. For w ∈ W , we denote
by ℓ(w) the length of w as usuall. We also denote the inner product on h∗ which is induced from
the above form by the same symbols h , i. For α ∈ ∆, we denote by sα the reflection in W with
respect to α. We denote by w0 the longest element of W . For α ∈ ∆, we define the coroot α̌ by
      2α
α̌ = hα,αi , as usual. We call λ ∈ h∗ is dominant (resp. anti-dominant), if hλ, α̌i is not a negative
(resp. positive) integer, for each α ∈ ∆+ . We call λ ∈ h∗ regular, if hλ, αi =
                                                                              6 0, for each α ∈ ∆.
                                                                    ∗
We denote by P the integral weight lattice, namely P = {λ ∈ h | hλ, α̌i ∈ Z for all α ∈ ∆}.


                                                 3
                                                                                   1P
If λ ∈ h∗ is contained in P, we call λ an integral weight.
                                                      P    We define ρ ∈ P by ρ =  2   α∈∆+ α.
Put gα = {X ∈ g | ∀H ∈ h [H, X] = α(H)X}, u = α∈∆+ gα , b = h + u. Then b is a Borel
subalgebra of g. We denote by Q the root lattice, namely Z-linear span of ∆. We also denote by
Q+ the linear combination of Π with non-negative integral coefficients. For λ ∈ h∗ , we denote
by Wλ the integral Weyl group. Namely,

                                 Wλ = {w ∈ W | wλ − λ ∈ Q}.

We denote by ∆λ the set of integral roots.

                                   ∆λ = {α ∈ ∆ | hλ, α̌i ∈ Z}.

It is well-known that Wλ is the Weyl group for ∆λ . We put ∆+          +
                                                                λ = ∆ ∩ ∆λ . This is a positive
system of ∆λ . We denote by Πλ the set of simple roots for ∆+     λ and denote by Φλ the set of
reflection corresponding to the elements in Πλ . So, (Wλ , Φλ ) is a Coxeter system. We denote
by Qλ the integral root lattice, namely Qλ = Z∆+               +
                                                  λ and put Qλ = NΠλ .
    Next, we fix notations for a parabolic subalgebra (which contains b). Hereafter, through
this article we fix an arbitrary subset Θ of Π. Let Θ̄ be the set of the elements of ∆ which are
written byP                  P of elements of Θ over Z. Put aΘ = {H ∈ h | ∀α ∈ Θ α(H) = 0},
            linear combinations
lΘ = h + α∈Θ̄ gα , nΘ = α∈∆+ \Θ̄ gα , pΘ = lΘ + nΘ . Then pΘ is a parabolic subalgebra of
g which contains b. Conversely, for an arbitrary parabolic subalgebra p ⊇ b, there exists some
Θ ⊆ Π such that p = pΘ . We denote by WΘ the Weyl group for (lΘ , h). WΘ is identified with
a subgroup of W generated by {sα | α ∈ Θ}. We denote by wΘ the longest element of WΘ .
Using the invariant non-degenerate bilinear form h , i, we regard aΘ ∗ as a subspace of h∗ . It is
known that there is a unique nilpotent (adjoint) orbit (say OpΘ ) whose intersection with nΘ is
Zarisky dense in nΘ . OpΘ is called the Richardson orbit with respect to pΘ . We denote by ŌpΘ
the closure of OpΘ in g. Put ρΘ = 12 (ρ − wΘ ρ) and ρΘ = 21 (ρ + wΘ ρ). Then, ρΘ ∈ aΘ ∗ .

1.3      Generalized Verma modules
Define
                                     ∗
                          P++
                           Θ = {λ ∈ h | ∀α ∈ Θ hλ, α̌i ∈ {1, 2, ...}}
                         ◦ ++
                          PΘ    = {λ ∈ h∗ | ∀α ∈ Θ hλ, α̌i = 1}

We easily have
                                   ◦ ++
                                    PΘ    = {ρΘ + µ | µ ∈ a∗Θ }.

For µ ∈ h∗ such that µ + ρ ∈ P++  Θ , we denote by σΘ (µ) the irreducible finite-dimensional lΘ -
representation whose highest weight is µ. Let EΘ (µ) be the representation space of σΘ (µ). We
define a left action of nΘ on EΘ (µ) by X · v = 0 for all X ∈ nΘ and v ∈ EΘ (µ). So, we regard
EΘ (µ) as a U (pΘ )-module.
    For µ ∈ P++Θ , we define a generalized Verma module ([Lepowsky 1977]) as follows.

                                MΘ (µ) = U (g) ⊗U (pΘ ) EΘ (µ − ρ).

For all λ ∈ h∗ , we write M (λ) = M∅ (λ). M (λ) is called a Verma module. For µ ∈ P++
                                                                                   Θ , MΘ (µ)
is a quotient module of M (µ). Let L(µ) be the unique highest weight U (g)-module with the

                                                 4
highest weight µ − ρ. Namely, L(µ) is a unique irreducible quotient of M (µ). For µ ∈ P++
                                                                                        Θ , the
canonical projection of M (µ) to L(µ) is factored by MΘ (µ).
   dim EΘ (µ − ρ) = 1 if and only if µ ∈ ◦ P++           ◦ ++
                                             Θ . If µ ∈ PΘ , we call MΘ (µ) a scalar generalized
Verma module.
   For a finitely generated U (g)-module V , we denote by Dim(V ) (resp. c(V )) the Gelfand-
Krillov dimesion (resp. the multiplicity) of V . (See [Vogan 1978]). We easily see Dim(MΘ (µ)) =
dim nΘ and c((MΘ (µ)) = dim EΘ (µ − ρ).
   The following result is one of the fundamental results on the existence problem of homomor-
phisms between scalar generalized Verma modules.

Theorem 1.3.1. ([Lepowsky 1976])
  Let µ, ν ∈ ◦ P++
                Θ .
  (1) dim HomU (g) (MΘ (µ), MΘ (ν)) 6 1.
  (2) Any non-zero homomoorphism of MΘ (µ) to MΘ (ν) is injective.

    Hence, the existence problem of homomorphisms between scalar generalized Verma modules
is reduce to the following problem.
    Problem Let µ, ν ∈ ◦ P++ Θ . When is MΘ (µ) ⊆ MΘ (ν) ?


1.4   Homomorphisms associated with Duflo involutions
Herafter we assume Θ ⊆ Π, µ ∈ P++  Θ and µ is dominant and regular. Then, we easily have
           ++
wΘ w0 µ ∈ PΘ . and MΘ (wΘ w0 µ) is irreducible. Here, we consider the following problem

Problem 1.4.1. When is MΘ (wΘ w0 µ) ֒→ MΘ (µ)?

   Concerning to Problem 1.4.1, a necessary and sufficient condition is known.

Theorem 1.4.2. ([Matumoto 1993]) Let Θ ⊆ Π and µ ∈ P++        Θ . If µ is dominant and regular,
then the following two conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent.
   (1) MΘ (wΘ w0 µ) ֒→ MΘ (µ).
   (2) wΘ w0 is a Dulfo involution for the Coxeter system (Wµ , Φµ ).

    In particular, the answer of Problem 2.1.1 only depend on the Coxter system (Wµ , Φµ ).
(In fact, this fact is a conclusion of the Kazdhan-Lusztig conjecture.) We can find a complex
reductive Lie algebra whose Weyl group (with a set of the simple reflections) are isomorphic to
(Wµ , Φµ ). So, we can deduce Problem 1.4.1 to the following special case.

Problem 1.4.3. When is MΘ (wΘ w0 ρ) ֒→ MΘ (ρ)?

   We also remark that the following easy fact.

Lemma 1.4.4. Let Θ ⊆ Π and λ ∈ ◦ P++ Θ such that wΘ w0 = w0 wΘ and wΘ w0 ∈ Wλ . We denote
by w0 be the longest element of Wλ with respect to Πλ . Then, w0 = w0′ and wΘ w0′ = w0′ wΘ .

1.5   Translation principle and its application
We denote by Z(g) the center of U (g). It is well-known that Z(g) acts on M (λ) by the Harish-
Chandra homomorphism χλ : Z(g) → C for all λ. χλ = χµ if and only if there exists some
w ∈ W such that λ = wµ. We denote by Zλ the kernel of χλ in Z(g). Let M be a U (g)-module
and λ ∈ h∗ . We say that M has an infinitesimal character λ if and only if Z(g) acts on M by
χλ . We say that M has a generalized infinitesimal character λ if and only if for any v ∈ M there
is some positive integer n such that Zλ n v = 0. We say M is locally Z(g)-finite, if and only if
for any v ∈ M we have dim Z(g)v < ∞. We denote by MZf (cf. [Bernstein-Gelfand 1980]) the
category of Z(g)-finite U (g)-modules. We also denote by M[λ] the category of U (g)-modules
with generalized infinitesimal character λ. L
                                            Then, from the Chinese remainder theorem, we have
a direct sum of abelian categories MZf = λ∈h∗ M[λ]. We denote by Pλ the projection functor
from MZf to M[λ]. For µ ∈ P, we denote by Vµ the irreducible finite-dimensional U (g)-module
with an extreme weight µ. Let µ, λ ∈ h∗ satisfy µ − λ ∈ P. Let M be an object of M[λ].
Then, from a result of Kostant we have that M ⊗ Vµ−λ is an object of MZf . So, we can define
translation functor Tλµ from M[λ] to M[µ] as follows.

                                      Tλµ (M ) = Pµ (M ⊗ Vµ−λ ).

The translation functors are exact.

   We put
                                  W (Θ) = {w ∈ W | wΘ = Θ}.
Then, W (Θ) is a subgroup of W . Moreover, wρΘ = ρΘ and wΘ w = wwΘ hold for all w ∈ W (Θ)
and W (Θ) preserves a∗Θ . In particular, W (Θ) ⊆ WρΘ .
    We say that λ ∈ a∗Θ is strongly Θ-antidominant if and only if hλ, αi 6 0 for all α ∈ Q+ ∩QρS +λ .
(Cf. [Matumoto 1993])
    Next, we consider the images of generalized Verma modules under certain translation func-
tors.
Lemma 1.5.1. (Cf. [Matumoto 1993] Lemma 1.2.3) Assume that µ, λ ∈ a∗Θ are strongly Θ-
antidominant and that λ − µ is dominant and integral. Let w ∈ W (Θ). Then, we have
                             −ρΘ +λ
                            T−ρΘ +µ
                                    (MΘ (ρΘ + wµ)) = MΘ (ρΘ + wλ).


§ 2. Sufficient conditions
For almost all (g, h, ∆+ , Θ), the necessary and sufficient condition given in Theorem 1.4.2 is hard
to check. So, we consider sufficient conditions, which we can check easily.

2.1   A sufficient condition
                                                                                                ∗
We fix the notations for characters. (Cf. [Dixmier 1977] 7.5.1, [Knapp 2002] V. 6) Let Ch be
                                                                ∗
the C-vector space of all functions from h∗ to C. For f ∈ Ch , we define supp(f ) = {λ ∈ h∗ |
                                                          ∗
f (λ) 6= 0}. For λ ∈ h∗ , we define eλ the member of Ch , that is 1 at λ and 0 elsewhere. Let
                                  ∗
C < h∗ > be the set of all f ∈ Ch such that supp(f ) is contained in the union of a finite number
                                                                                   ∗
of sets νi − Q+ with each νi in h∗ . We introduce the structure of C-algebra on Ch as in [Knapp
2002] (5.65).

                                                  6
   Let V be a U (g)-module. For λ ∈ h∗ , we define the weight space with respect to λ as follows.

                              Vλ = {v ∈ V | ∀H ∈ h Hv = λ(H)v}

   We say that V has a character if V is the direct sum of its weight spaces under h and if
dim Vλ 6 ∞ for all λ ∈ h∗ . In this case, the character is
                                             X
                                      [V ] =     (dim Vλ )eλ .
                                             λ∈h∗


   For example, for λ ∈ P++
                         Θ , the following formula is well-known.
                                                    X
                                [MΘ (λ)] = D −1          (−1)ℓ(w) ewλ .
                                                  w∈WΘ

Here, we denote by D the Weyl denominator, namely D = eρ α∈∆+ (1 − e−α ). In particular,
                                                               Q
we have [M (λ)] = D−1 eλ .
                                                                             ∗
   We put Bst = {[M (wρ)] | w ∈ W } and denote by C the subspace of Ch spanned by Bst .
We also put Birr = {[L(wρ)] | w ∈ W }. Then, Bst and Birr are bases of C. We identify
the group algebra C[W ] with C via the correspondence W ∋ w ! [M (ww0 ρ)] ∈ Bst . We
can introduce a W -module structure on C identifying C and the right regular representation on
                                             L     R
C[W ]. We consider the equivalence relations ∼ and ∼ on W defined in [Kazdhan-Lusztig 1979].
The representation theoretic meanings of these equivalence relations are as follows.

Theorem 2.1.1. ([Joseph 1977], [Vogan 1980]) Let x, y ∈ W . Then we have
            L
   (1)    x ∼ y if and only if AnnU (g) (L(xw0 ρ)) = AnnU (g) (L(yw0 ρ)).
             R
    (2)    x ∼ y if and only if there exist some finite-dimensional U (g)-modules E1 and E2
such that L(xw0 ρ) and L(yw0 ρ) are irreducible constituents of E1 ⊗ L(yw0 ρ) and E2 ⊗ L(xw0 ρ),
respectively.
                                                                                              R
    For x ∈ W , we denote by VxR the C-vector space with a basis Bx = {[L(yw0 ρ)] | y ∼ x}.
If we identify VxR with a subquotient of C appropriately, we may regard VxR a W -module. (For
example, see [Barbasch-Vogan 1983]). VxR is called a right cell representation.
    We denote by H the space of W -harmonic polynomials on h∗ , which can be regarded as a
W -module in a usual manner (cf. [Vogan 1978]).
    We quote:

Theorem 2.1.2. ([Vogan 1978], [Joseph 1980a 1980b])
    For x ∈ W , there is a W -homomorphism φx of VxR to H satisfying the following conditions.
    (1) The image φx (VxR ) ⊆ H is an irreducible representation.
    (2) The image φx (VxR ) is the special representation corresponding to the unique open dense
nilpotent orbit in the associated variety of AnnU (g) (L(xw0 ρ)) via the Springer correspondence.
In particular, φwΘ (VwRΘ ) is the special representation corresponding to the Richardson orbit OpΘ .
                                    R   R      L
    (3) For y, z ∈ W such that y ∼ x ∼ z, y ∼ z if and only if φx ([L(yw0 ρ)]) and φx ([L(zw0 ρ)])
are proportional to each other.

   Now, we state a sufficient condition.


                                                    7
Proposition 2.1.3. Assume that Θ ⊆ Π satisfy wΘ w0 = w0 wΘ . Moreover, we assume that VwRΘ
is irreducible as a W -module. Then, we have MΘ (wΘ w0 ρ) ⊆ MΘ (ρ).

Proof. We put I = AnnU (g) (MΘ (wΘ w0 ρ)). I is primitive, since MΘ (wΘ w0 ρ) is irreducible.
Since wΘ w0 = w0 wΘ , we have w0 wΘ ∈ W (S). So, from [Borho-Jantzen 1977] 4.10 Corollary, we
have I = AnnU (g) (MΘ (ρ)). Since c(MΘ (ρ)) = 1, MΘ (ρ) has a unique irreducible constituent of
maximal Gelfand-Killirov dimension (say L(σρ)). Here, σ is an element of W . (In fact we we
easy to prove L(σρ) is the unique irreducible submodule of MΘ (ρ). ) Assuming that σ 6= wΘ w0 ,
we shall deduce a contradiction.
   When we regard a U (g)-module E as a U (pΘ )-module, we write it by E|pΘ . Since MΘ (µ) ⊗
  ∼                                                                 R
E = U (g) ⊗U (p ) (EΘ (µ − ρ) ⊗ E|p ) holds, we easily see that σw0 ∼ wΘ .
                Θ                   Θ
   From [Borho-Kraft 1976] 3.6, we see I = AnnU (g) (L(σρ)). From Theorem 1.6.1, we have
      L
wΘ ∼ σw0 .
     Hence, from Theorem 1.6.2, φwΘ is not injective. This contradicts our assumption that VwRΘ
is irreducible.    Q.E.D.
     The multiplicity of a special representation φx (VxR ) in a right cell VxR is one. Moreover, any
irreducible constituents in the right cell VxR belongs to the same family (see [Lusztig 1984] p78)
as φx (VxR ). So, we have:
Corollary 2.1.4. Assume that Θ ⊆ Π satisfy wΘ w0 = w0 wΘ and that the family of the special
representation corresponding to the Richardson orbit OpΘ does not contain any other element.
Then, we have MΘ (wΘ w0 ρ) ⊆ MΘ (ρ).
                    LR                                               L      R
    We denote by ∼ the equivalence relation on W generated by ∼ and ∼. The following result
is well-known and follows from Theorem 2.1.1.
                                                  LR
Corollary 2.1.5. Let x, y ∈ W be such that x ∼ y. Then Dim(L(xw0 ρ)) = Dim(L(yw0 ρ)).
                                                                   LR                       LR
   From [Barbasch-Vogan 1983] Corollary 2.24 implies that x ∼ y if and only if xw0 ∼ yw0 .
Hence, we have:
                                               LR
Lemma 2.1.6. Let x, y ∈ W be such that x ∼ y. Then Dim(L(xρ)) = Dim(L(yρ)).

2.2       Maximal parabolic subalgebras
                                                                                                   α
Hereafter we fix α ∈ Π. Put Θα = Π − {α}. aΘα is one-dimensional and spanned by ρΘ .
Moreover, we have
                                  ◦ ++                 α
                                   PΘα   = {ρΘα + tρΘ | t ∈ C}.

    We denote by ωα the fundamental weight corresponding to α. For any β ∈ Θα = Π − {α},
                α                                                              α     α
we have hβ, ρΘ i = 0. Hence there exists some dα ∈ R such that dα ωα = ρΘ . Since 2ρΘ is
integral, we have dα ∈ 12 N.
    Fir simplicity, for t ∈ C, we write MΘα [t] for MΘα (ρΘα + tωα ). We have:
Lemma 2.2.1. Let s and t be distinct complex numbers such that MΘα [s] ⊆ MΘα [t]. Then,
s = −t.




                                                 8
Proof. Since MΘα [s] and MΘα [t] have the same infinitesimal character, there exists some w ∈ W
such that ρΘα + tωα = w(ρΘα + sωα ). Hence, hρΘα + tωα , ρΘα + tωα i = hρΘα + sωα , ρΘα + sωα i.
From hωα , ρΘα i = 0, we have t2 = s2 . So, s = −t. ✷
   We easily have:
Lemma 2.2.2. (1) If wΘα w0 = w0 wΘα , then wΘα w0 (ρΘα + tωα ) = ρΘα − tωα for all t ∈ C.
  (2) If wΘα w0 6= w0 wΘα , then wΘα w0 (ρΘα + tωα ) = ρΘα − tωα if and only if t = dα .
   We put

                                 cα = min{c ∈ R | 2cωα ∈ Q+ }.

   Clearly 2cα is a positive integer.
Lemma 2.2.3. If wΘα w0 = w0 wΘα , then either cα = 1 or cα = 12 .

Proof. We have only to show cα 6 1. We may assume g is simple. If g is a simple Lie algebra
of the type other than An , D2n+1 , and E6 , then the exponent of Q/P is 1 or 2. So, in this case
2ωα ∈ Q+ for any α ∈ Π. For the case of the type An , D2n+1 , or E6 , we can check 2ωα ∈ Q+
under the assumption wΘα w0 = w0 wΘα by the case-by-case analysis.       ✷
    If MΘα [−t] ⊆ MΘα [t] holds, then 2tωα = (ρΘα + tωα ) − (ρΘα − tωα ) is in Q+ . So, we have:
Corollary 2.2.4. If wΘα w0 = w0 wΘα and if MΘα [−t] ⊆ MΘα [t] holds, then t ∈ 21 N. Moreover,
if cα = 1, then MΘα [−t] ֒→ MΘα [t] implies t ∈ N.
Definition 2.2.5. If t ∈ 21 N and ρΘα + tωα is not integral, we say ρΘα + tωα is half-integral.
   We examine behavior of the translation functors in the setting of this subsection.
   First, Lemma 1.5.1 and the exactness of the translation functor imply:
Lemma 2.2.6. Assume wΘα w0 = w0 wΘα . Let t ∈ R and n ∈ N be such that t − n > 0. Then,
MΘα [−t] ⊆ MΘα [t] implies MΘα [−t + n] ⊆ MΘα [t − n].
   From the translation principle, we also have:
Lemma 2.2.7. Assume wΘα w0 = w0 wΘα . Let t ∈ R be such that ρΘα +tωα is dominant regular.
Let n ∈ N. Then, MΘα [−t] ⊆ MΘα [t] implies MΘα [−t − n] ⊆ MΘα [t + n].
    In case ρΘα + tωα is not dominant regular, the corresponding statement to Lemma 1.7.6 is
not necessarily correct. In fact, we need an extra assumption.
    Let G be a complex connected reductive Lie group, whose Lie algebra is g. Let PΘ be
the parabolic subgroup of G corresponding to pΘ . We consider the generalized flag variety
XΘ = G/PΘ . Since the holomorphic cotangent bundle T ∗ XΘ has a natural symplectic structure,
we can construct the moment map mΘ : T ∗ XΘ → g∗ . Using h , i, we identify g and g∗ . Then,
we regard the moment map as a surjective map of T ∗ XΘ to the closure of the Richardson orbit
OpΘ .
    We easily see the number N1 (PΘ ) defined in [Hesselink 1978] 1.4 Step3 is the degree of the
moment map mΘ : T ∗ XΘ → OpΘ . So, N1 (PΘ ) = 1 if and only if mΘ is birational. For classical
Lie algebras, N1 (PΘ ) is obtained in [Hesselink 1978] 7.1 Theorem.
Lemma 2.2.8. ([Matumoto 1993] Proposition 2.2.3) Assume wΘα w0 = w0 wΘα and the moment
map mΘ : T ∗ XΘα → OpΘα is birational. Let n ∈ N. Then, MΘα [−t] ⊆ MΘα [t] implies MΘα [−t−
n] ⊆ MΘα [t + n].

                                               9
   Since MΘα [0] ⊆ MΘα [0], we have
Corollary 2.2.9. ([Matumoto 1993] Corollary 2.2.4)
   Assume wΘα w0 = w0 wΘα and the moment map mΘ : T ∗ XΘα → OpΘα is birational. Then,
we have MΘα [−n] ⊆ MΘα [n] for all n ∈ N.
   Next, we introduce Jantzen’s criterion for the irreducibility of a generalized Verma module.
   For any λ ∈ h∗ , we define an element of C < h∗ > as follows.
                                               X
                               ΥΘα (λ) = D −1        (−1)ℓ(w) ewλ .
                                                w∈WΘα

Of course, for λ ∈ P++
                    Θα , we have ΥΘα (λ) = [MΘα (λ)].
                                  α +
   Put ∆Θα = ZΘ ∩ ∆ and ∆Θ
                   α                   = ∆+ − ∆Θα . We immediately have:
Corollary 2.2.10.
  (1) If λ ∈ h∗ satisfies hβ, λi = 0 for some β ∈ ∆Θα , then ΥΘα (λ) = 0.
  (2) For λ ∈ h∗ and w ∈ WΘα , we have ΥΘα (λ) − (−1)ℓ(w) ΥΘα (wλ) = 0.
   The following result is a special case of [Jantzen 1977] Satz 3.
Theorem 2.2.11. (Jantzen)
  For λ ∈ P++
           Θα , the following (1) and (2) are equivalent.
  (1) MΘ (λ) is irreducible.
           α

  (2) We have
                                     X
                                             ΥΘα (sβ λ) = 0.
                                          α +
                                    β∈(∆Θ )
                                  hλ,β ∨ i∈N−{0}

    Remark The above statement is slightly different from that in Jantzen’s paper. However,
we consider maximal parabolic subalgebras. In this case, we can easily see the above condition
(2) is equivalent to the condition of Jantzen.


§ 3.      Classical Lie algebras
Throughout this section, n means a positive integer such that n > 2 (resp. n > 4) whenever we
consider the simple Lie algebra of the type Bn or Cn (resp. Dn ).

3.1   The root systems
We retain the notations in §1 and §2.
   (Bn type) We consider the root system ∆ for g = so(2n + 1, C). Then we can choose an
orthonormal basis e1 , ..., en of h∗ such that

                      ∆ = {±ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 n} ∪ {±ei | 1 6 i 6 n}.

We choose a positive system as follows.

                       ∆+ = {ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 n} ∪ {ei | 1 6 i 6 n}.


                                                   10
If we put αi = ei − ei+1 (1 6 i < n) and αn = en , then Π = {α1 , ..., αn }.
      For simplicity, we write Θk for Θαk for 1 6 k 6 n. Then lΘk is isomorphic to gl(k, C) ×
so(2(n − k) + 1, C). Since w0 is contained in the center of W , we have w0 wΘk = wΘk w0 for any
1 6 k 6 n.
      We write ωk , ck , and dk for ωαk , cαk , and dαk , respectively. Then, for 1 6 k < n, we have
ωk = e1 + · · · + ek , ck = 12 , and dk = n − k2 . If k = n, then ωn = 21 (e1 + · · · + en ), cn = 1, and
dn = n.
      Assume k is even or k = n. Then, ρΘk + tωk is integral if and only if t ∈ Z.
      Assume k is odd and 1 6 k < n. Then, ρΘk + tωk is integral if and only if t − 12 ∈ Z.
      (Cn type)
      We consider the root system ∆ for g = sp(n, C). Then we can choose an orthonormal basis
e1 , ..., en of h∗ such that

                       ∆ = {±ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 n} ∪ {±2ei | 1 6 i 6 n}.

We choose a positive system as follows.

                        ∆+ = {ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 n} ∪ {2ei | 1 6 i 6 n}.

If we put αi = ei − ei+1 (1 6 i < n) and αn = 2en , then Π = {α1 , ..., αn }.
      For simplicity, we write Θk for Θαk for 1 6 k 6 n. Then lΘk is isomorphic to gl(k, C)×sp(n−
k, C). Since w0 is contained in the center of W , we have w0 wΘk = wΘk w0 for any 1 6 k 6 n.
      We write ωk , ck , and dk for ωαk , cαk , and dαk , respectively. Then, for 1 6 k 6 n we have
                                                                               1
ωk = e1 + · · · + ek and dk = n − k−1 2 . If k is even (resp. odd), then ck = 2 (resp. ck = 1).
      Assume k is odd. Then, ρΘk + tωk is integral if and only if t ∈ Z.
      Assume k is even. Then, ρΘk + tωk is integral if and only if t − 12 ∈ Z.
      (Dn type)
      We consider the root system ∆ for g = so(2n, C). Then we can choose an orthonormal basis
e1 , ..., en of h∗ such that

                                   ∆ = {±ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 n}.

We choose a positive system as follows.

                                   ∆+ = {ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 n}.

If we put αi = ei − ei+1 (1 6 i < n) and αn = en−1 + en , then Π = {α1 , ..., αn }.
    For simplicity, we write Θk for Θαk for 1 6 k 6 n. Since the case of k = n − 1 is essentially
same as the case of k = n, since pΘn−1 and pΘn are conjugate under an automorphism of g. So,
when we consider the type D case, we omitt the case of k = n − 1.
    Then, lΘk is isomorphic to gl(k, C) × so(2(n − k), C). We have w0 wΘk = wΘk w0 for any
1 6 k < n. However, w0 wΘn = wΘn w0 if and only if n is even.
    We write ωk , ck , and dk for ωαk , cαk , and dαk , respectively. Then, for 1 6 k < n − 1, we
                                                                                             1
have ωk = e1 + · · · + ek and dk = n − k+12 . If k is even (resp. odd) and k 6= n, then ck = 2 (resp.
ck = 1).
    For k = n, we have ωn = 21 (e1 + · · · + en ), cn = 1, and dn = n. If n is even (resp. odd), then
cn = 1 (resp. ck = 2).
    Assume k is odd or k = n. Then, ρΘk + tωk is integral if and only if t ∈ Z.
    Assume k is even and 1 6 k < n. Then, ρΘk + tωk is integral if and only if t − 12 ∈ Z.

3.2   Statements of the main results
Here, we describe the existence of homomorphisms between scalar generalized Verma modules
with respect to the maximal parabolic subalgebras of classical Lie algebras. For simple Lie
algebras of type A, the answer is given in [Boe 1985]. So, we treat the case of the types of B,C,
and D.
Theorem 3.2.1. (Bn -type)
  Consider the case of g = so(2n + 1, C). Let k be a positive integer such that k 6 n.
  (1) We consider the case that 3k < 2n + 1. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
  (2) We consider the case that 3k > 2n + 1.
    (2a) Assume k is odd and k 6= n. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ 21 N.
    (2b) Assume n is odd. Then, MΘn [−t] ⊆ MΘn [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
    (2c) Assume k is even. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t = 0.
   Remark The case of k = 1 is due to [Lepowsky 1975a]. The cases of k = 1, 2, 3, n are in
the multiplicity free case in [Boe-Collingwood 1990].
Theorem 3.2.2. (Cn -type)
  Consider the case of g = sp(n, C). Let k be a positive integer such that k 6 n.
  (1) We consider the case that 3k 6 2n.
    (1a) Assume k is odd. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t = 0.
    (1b) Assume k is even. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ 12 N.
  (2) We consider the case that 3k > 2n. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
   Remark The case of k = 2 is due to [Lepowsky 1975a]. The case of k = n is due to [Boe
1985]. The cases of k = 1, 2, 3, n are in the multiplicity free case in [Boe-Collingwood 1990].
Theorem 3.2.3. (Dn -type)
  Consider the case of g = so(2n, C). Let k be a positive integer such that k 6 n − 2 or k = n.
  (1) We consider the case that 3k < 2n. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
  (2) We consider the case that 3k > 2n.
    (2a) Assume k is odd. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t = 0.
    (2b) Assume k is even and k 6= n. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ 12 N.
    (2c) Assume n is even. Then, MΘn [−t] ⊆ MΘn [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
   Remark The case of k = 1 is due to [Lepowsky 1975a]. The case of k = n is due to [Boe
1985]. The cases of k = 1, 2, n are in the multiplicity free case in [Boe-Collingwood 1990].
   We give proofs of the above theorems in the subsquent sections.

3.3   Richardson orbits
We consider a partition π = (p1 , ..., pk ) of a positive integer m such that 0 < p1 6 p2 6 · · · 6 pk
and p1 + p2 + · · · + pk = m. We put π[i] = card{j | pj = i} for any positive integer i. Let
                                                                  π[h ]    π[h ]
{h1 , ..., hr } = {i ∈ N | i > 0, π[i] > 0}. Then, we write h1 1 · · · hr r for π. For example,
5 · 32 · 15 means (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5).
     Type Bn The nilpotent orbits in g = so(2n + 1, C) are parametrized by partitions π of
2n + 1 such that, for any even number 2i, π[2i] is even. (For example see [Carter 1985] p394)
From [Collingwood-McGovern 1993] 7 and [Hesselink 1978] 7.1, we have:


                                                 12
Lemma 3.3.1. Let g = so(2n + 1, C).
    (1) If 3k < 2n+1, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the partition 3k ·12n+1−3k .
In this case, the moment map mΘk is birational.
    (2) If 3k > 2n+1 and k is odd, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the partition
32n+1−2k · 23k−2n−1 . In this case, the moment map mΘk is birational.
    (3)    If 3k > 2n + 1 and k is even, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the
partition 32n+1−2k · 23k−2n−2 · 12 .
   From Corollary 2.2.9, and Lemma 3.3.1, we have:
Lemma 3.3.2. Let g = so(2n + 1, C). Assume that 3k 6 2n + 1 or k is odd. Then, we have
MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for all t ∈ N.
   Type Cn The nilpotent orbits in g = sp(n, C) are parametrized by partitions π of 2n such
that, for any odd number 2i + 1, π[2i + 1] is even. (For example see [Carter 1985] p394) From
[Collingwood-McGovern 1993] 7 and [Carter 1985] Chapter 13, we have:
Lemma 3.3.3. Let g = sp(2n, C).
    (1) If 3k 6 2n and k is even, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the partition
3 · 12n−3k . In this case the moment map mΘk is birational.

    (2) If 3k 6 2n and k is odd, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the partition
3k−1 · 22 · 12n−3k−1 .
    (3) If 3k > 2n, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the partition 32n−2k ·23k−2n .
In this case, the moment map mΘk is birational.
   From Corollary 2.2.9, and Lemma 3.3.3, we have:
Lemma 3.3.4. Let g = sp(2n, C). Assume that 3k > 2n or k is even. Then, we have MΘk [−t] ⊆
MΘk [t] for all t ∈ N.
     Type Dn           We can associate a nilpotent orbit in g = so(2n, C) with a partition π =
(p1 , ..., pk ) of 2n such that, for any even number 2i, π[2i] is even. If there is at least one odd
number in p1 , ..., pk , there is a unique nilpotent orbit associated with (p1 , ..., pk ). The exceptional
orbits are so-called very even nilpotent orbits. If p1 , ..., pk are all even, there are two nilpotent
orbits associated with the partition (p1 , ..., pk ). (For example see [Carter 1985] p395) From
[Collingwood-McGovern 1993] 7 and [Hesselink 1978] 7.1, we have:
Lemma 3.3.5. Let g = so(2n, C) and let 1 6 k 6 n − 2 or k = n.
    (1) If 3k 6 2n, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the partition 3k · 12n−3k . In
this case, the moment map mΘk is birational.
    (2) If 3k > 2n and k is odd, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the partition
32n−2k · 23k−2n−1 · 12 .
    (3) If 3k > 2n and k is even, then the Richardson orbit OpΘk corresponds to the partition
32n−2k  · 23k−2n . In this case, the moment map mΘk is birational.
   From Corollary 2.2.9, and Lemma 3.3.5, we have:
Lemma 3.3.6. Let g = so(2n, C). Assume that 3k 6 2n or k is even. Then, we have MΘk [−t] ⊆
MΘk [t] for all t ∈ N.

3.4   Existence results via comparison
In this subsection, we prove the following result.

Lemma 3.4.1.
   (1)    Assume that g = sp(n, C) and that k is an even positive integer such that 3k 6 2n.
Then, we have MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for all t ∈ 21 + N.
   (2) Assume that g = so(2n+1, C) and that k is an odd positive integer such that 3k > 2n+1
and k 6= n. Then, we have MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for all t ∈ 21 + N.
    Proof We prove (1). We can prove (2) in a similar way.
    Let k be an even positive integer such that 3k 6 2n. At first, we consider the case that
                                  k
g = so(2n + 1, C). In this case ρΘ = dk ωk = (n − k2 )ωk from 3.1. Therefore, ρ = ρΘk + (n − k2 )ωk
and wΘk w0 ρ = ρΘk −(n− k2 )ωk . Since n− k2 ∈ N, Lemma 3.3.2 implies MΘk (wΘk w0 ρ) ⊆ MΘk (ρ).
From Theorem 1.4.2, wΘk w0 is a Duflo involution in the Weyl group for (g, h), where g =
so(2n + 1, C). However, the Weyl group of the Bn -type and that of the Cn -type are isomorphic
to each other as a Coxeter system. Since the notion of the Duflo involutions only depends on
the structure of the Coxeter system, we see that as an element of the Weyl group for sp(n, C),
wΘk w0 is a Duflo involution. From Theorem 1.4.2 implies MΘk (wΘk w0 ρ) ⊆ MΘk (ρ) holds for
                                                                                           1
the case that g = sp(n, C). Namely, MΘk [−dk ] ⊆ MΘk [dk ]. In this case, dk = n − n−12 ∈ 2 + N.
                                                                                 1
So, from Lemma 2.2.6 and Lemma 2.2.7, we have MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for all t ∈ 2 + N.        Q.E.D.

3.5   Irreducibility of a right cell
In this subsection, we treat the remaining case that nontrivial homomorphisms exist. Namely,
we show:

Lemma 3.5.1. Assume that g = so(2n, C) and that k is an even positive integer such that
3k > 2n, k 6 n, and k 6= n − 1. Then, we have MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for all t ∈ 21 + N.

Proof. If k = n, then nΘk is abelian. This case is treated in [Boe 1985]. So, we assume that k is
an even positive integer such that 3k > 2n, k < n − 1. Put s = k2 . As in [Carter 1985] p376, we
can associate an irreducible representation of the Weyl group of the type Dn with a so-called
symbol. A symbol is a pair of strictly increasing sequence of non-negative integers of the same
length. We identify two symbols;
                                                                  
                                λ1 , ..., λk            µ1 , ..., µk
                                               and                     .
                                µ1 , ..., µk            λ1 , ..., λk

As in [Carter 1985] 13.3, we can associate the partition 32n−2k · 23k−2n to a pair of partitions as
follows.                                                                              
                  1, 2, 3, ..., 3s − n, 3s − n + 2, 3s − n + 3, 3s − n + 4, ..., s + 2
                  1, 2, 3, ..., 3s − n, 3s − n + 1, 3s − n + 2, 3s − n + 3, ..., s + 1
This is the symbol associated with the special representation (say πk ) corresponding to the
Richardson orbit OpΘk via the Springer correspondence. (Lusztig, Shoji)
   As in [Carter 1985] 13.2, two irreducible representation with symbols:
                                                     ′
                                                       λ1 , ..., λ′k
                                                                    
                                λ1 , ..., λk
                                               and
                                µ1 , ..., µk           µ′1 , ..., µ′k

                                                14
are contained in the same family if and only if {λ1 , ..., λk , µ1 , ..., µk } = {λ′1 , ..., λ′k , µ′1 , ..., µ′k }.
So, we easily see the family of πk consists of only one element. From Corollary 2.1.4, we have
                                                               1
MΘk (wΘk w0 ρ) ⊆ MΘk (ρ). In this case, dk = n − k+1  2 ∈ 2 + N. So, from Lemma 2.2.6 and
Lemma 2.2.7, we have MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for all t ∈ 12 + N.       Q.E.D.
    Remark We can prove Lemma 3.4.1 in a similar way to Lemma 3.4.2.

3.6     Irreducibility of some generalized Verma modules
We have:
Lemma 3.6.1.
   (1) Assume that g = so(2n + 1, C) and that k is an even positive integer such that k < n.
Then, MΘk ( 21 ) is irreducible.
   (2) Assume that g = so(2n + 1, C) and that n is even. Then, MΘn (1) is irreducible.
   (3) Assume that g = so(2n, C) and that k is an even positive integer such that 3k < 2n.
Then, MΘk ( 12 ) is irreducible.
   (4) Assume that g = so(2n+1, C) and that k is an odd positive integer such that 3k < 2n+1.
Then, MΘk ( 21 ) is irreducible.
   (5)  Assume that g = sp(n, C) and that k is an even positive integer such that 3k > 2n.
Then, MΘk ( 21 ) is irreducible.
   (6) Assume that g = sp(n, C). Then, MΘ1 (1) is irreducible.

Proof. For 2 6 r 6 k, we put r ⋆ = k + 2 − r.
   First, we prove (1). We put s = k2 . Then, we see

                                           2s                 n

                                            i=1                  j=2s+1

    We easily see

    For 2 6 i 6 s, hei −e2s−i+2 , sei (ρΘk + 12 ωk )i = 0. Hence, Corollary 2.2.10 implies ΥΘα (sei (ρΘk +
1
2 ωk )) = 0.
    Next, we assume that 1 6 i < j 6 2s and that 2s + 2 > i + j. Since i < j, 2s + 2 > i + j
implies i 6 s. If 2 6 i, then we see j 6= i⋆ and hej − ei⋆ , sei +ej (ρΘk + 21 ωk )i = 0. So, Corollary
2.2.10 implies ΥΘα (sei +ej (ρΘk + 21 ωk )) = 0. If i = 1 and j 6= s + 1, then j 6= j ⋆ 6= 1 and
he1 − ej ⋆ , sei +ej (ρΘk + 12 ωk )i = 0. So, Corollary 2.2.10 implies ΥΘk (sei +ej (ρΘk + 21 ωk )) = 0.
    Hence, we have

From Jantzen’s criterion (Theorem 2.2.11), MΘk [ 12 ] is irreducible. So, we get (1).
   (2) is proved in the same way as (1).
   Next, we prove (3).
   We put s = k2 . Then, we see

From Jantzen’s criterion (Theorem 2.2.11), MΘk [ 12 ] is irreducible. So, we get (4).
   (5) and (6) is due to [Gyoja 1994] p394. They are proved similarly.        Q.E.D.
   Lemma 3.6.1 and Lemma 2.2.6 imply:
Lemma 3.6.2. (1) Assume that g = so(2n + 1, C) and that k is an even positive integer such
that k < n. Then, MΘk [−t − 21 ] 6⊆ MΘk [t + 12 ] for all t ∈ N.
    (2) Assume that g = so(2n + 1, C) and that n is even. Then, MΘk [−t] 6⊆ MΘk [t] for all
t ∈ N.
    (3) Assume that g = so(2n, C) and that k is an even positive integer such that 3k < 2n.
Then, MΘk [−t − 12 ] 6⊆ MΘk [t + 21 ] for all t ∈ N.
    (4) Assume that g = so(2n+1, C) and that k is an odd positive integer such that 3k < 2n+1.
Then, MΘk [−t − 21 ] 6⊆ MΘk [t + 21 ] for all t ∈ N.
    (5)   Assume that g = sp(n, C) and that k is an even positive integer such that 3k > 2n.
Then, MΘk [−t − 21 ] 6⊆ MΘk [t + 21 ] for all t ∈ N.
    (6) Assume that g = sp(n, C). Then, MΘ1 [−t] 6⊆ MΘ1 [t] for all t ∈ N.

3.7    Nonexistence results for the remaining cases
First, we assume that g = so(2n, C), n is odd, and k = n. This case is treated in [Boe 1985]. In
fact, his result contains:
Lemma 3.7.1. (Boe) Assume g = so(2n, C) and n is odd. Then, MΘn [−t] ⊆ MΘn [t] if and
only if t = 0.


                                                               17
    Hereafter we do not consider the above case. Therefore, from 2.1, we have wΘk w0 = w0 wΘk .
The results in 3.3-3.6 and Corollary 2.2.4 imply that Theorem 3.2.1-3.2.3 is reduced to the
following lemma.
Lemma 3.7.2.
   (1) Assume that g = so(2n + 1, C) and that k is an even positive integer such that 3k >
2n + 1 and k < n. Then, MΘk [−t − 1] 6⊆ MΘk [t + 1] for all t ∈ N.
   (2) Assume that g = sp(n, C) and that k is an odd positive integer such that 3k 6 2n and
1 < k. Then, MΘk [−t − 1] 6⊆ MΘk [t + 1] for all t ∈ N.
   (3)   Assume that g = so(2n, C) and that k is an odd positive integer such that 3k > 2n.
Then, MΘk [−t − 1] 6⊆ MΘk [t + 1] for all t ∈ N.

Proof. From Lemma 2.2.6, we have only to show that MΘk [−1] 6⊆ MΘk [1].
    We put Ω = W · (ρΘk + ωk ) ∩ P++ Θk
                                        . Then, in the settings of (1), (2), and (3) above, Ω consists
of four elements (say λ1 , ...λ4 ). We can write λ1 = ρΘk + ωk and λ4 = ρΘk − ωk . The remaining
two elements are as follows.
    If g = so(2n + 1, C) and if k = 2s is an even positive integer such that 3k > 2n + 1 and
k < n, then we may write:

   If g = sp(n, C) and if k = 2s + 1 is an odd positive integer such that 3k 6 2n and 1 < k,
then we may write:

   If g = so(2n, C) and if k = 2s + 1 is an odd positive integer such that 3k > 2n + 1 and k < n,
then we may write:

                             ΥΘk (sβ λ3 ) = ΥΘk (se1 +en−s+1 λ3 ) = −[MΘk (λ4 )] 6= 0.

Therefore we have Claim 1.           ✷
   Claim 2       There is a non-trivial U (g)-homomorphism ϕ : MΘk (λ2 ) → MΘk (λ1 ).
   Proof of Claim 2    We remark that neither λ3 − λ1 nor λ3 − λ2 are contained in Q+ . So,
Claim 1 implies that MΘk (λ4 ) ⊆ MΘk (λ3 ). On the other hand, Zuckerman’s duality theorem
([Boe-Collingwood 1985] 4.9, [Collingwood-Shelton 1990] Theorem 1.1, [Gyoja 2000]) implies

             dim HomU (g) (MΘk (λ4 ), MΘk (λ3 )) = dim HomU (g) (MΘk (λ2 ), MΘk (λ1 )).

Hence there is a non-trivial ϕ ∈ HomU (g) (MΘk (λ2 ), (MΘk (λ1 )).         ✷
   We need:
   Claim 3       Dim(L(λ2 )) = dim nΘk .
   Since the multiplicity (the Bernstein degree) of any scalar generalized Verma module is one,
Claim 2 and Claim 3 imply L(λ2 ) is a unique irreducible constituent of MΘk (λ1 ) = MΘk [1]
whose Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is dim nΘk . On the other hand, Dim(MΘk [−1]) = dim nΘk
and MΘk [−1] is irreducible. Hence, MΘk [−1] 6⊆ MΘk [1] and we have Lemma 3.7.2. So, we have
only to show Claim 3.
   Proof of Claim 3
   Let σ ∈ W be the longest element (with respect to the length ℓ(·)) in

                           {w ∈ W | λ2 is dominant with respect to w∆+ }.

    Then, σρ and λ2 are contained in the same closed Weyl chamber and we can regard L(λ2 )
                               λ2 (L(σρ)) ∼ L(λ ). Since Dim(L(σρ)) = Dim(λ ), Claim 3 is
as a limit of L(σρ). Namely, Tσρ          =    2                            2
reduced to the following Claim 4. (Cf. Lemma 2.1.6.)

    Claim 4      σ ∼ wΘk w0 .
    Proof of Claim 4             Claim 4 is obtained by the algorithm described in [Barbasch-Vogan
1982] p171-175.
    First, we assume g = sp(n, C) and that k is an odd positive integer such that 3k 6 2n and
1 < k.
    We put δ = 10−23 . (In fact, δ can be any real number suchPthat 0 < δ < 12 .) Put
λ′2 = λ2 − δωk . We also put ai = hei , λ′2 i for 1 6 i 6 n. Namely, λ′2 = ni=1 ai ei . Then, we easily
see |a1 |, ...., |an | are distinct. Let b1 , ..., bn be positive real numbers such that b1 > b2 > · · · > bn
and {b1 , ..., bn } = {|a1 |, ...., |an |}. So, there is a permutation τ ∈ Sn such that |ai | P  = bτ (i) for
1 6 i 6 n. For 1 6 i 6 n, we put ci = |aaii | (n − τ (i) + 1). Then, we have σρ = ni=1 cn en .
Barbasch and Vogan attach σ to the sequence (c1 , ..., cn , −cn , ..., −c1 ) ([Barbasch-Vogan 1982]
p173). Applying the Robinson-Schensted algorithm to this sequence, we get a pair of Young
tableaux. (These Young tableaux have the same shape.) Remark that the Robinson-Schemsted
algorithm in [Barbasch-Vogan 1982] is a little bit different from the usual one (see [Barbasch-
Vogan 1982] p171). For our purpose, the important information is the shape of these Young
tableaux. In order to obtain such a Young diagram, we need not compute c1 , ..., cn . In fact,
applying the Robinson-Schensted algorithm to the sequence (a1 , ...., an , −an , ..., −a1 ) directly,
we have the same Young diagram. In this case, the Young diagram          k−1 corresponds to the partition
                                                                           2          n−k+1
of 2n, (2n − 2k, k + 1, k − 1). It corresponds to the symbol                    k+1               .
                                                                               2

                            2
        LR
have σ ∼ wΘk w0 .
    Next, we consider the case of g = so(2n + 1, C). We define λ′2 , ai (1 6 i 6 n), bi
(1 6 i 6 n), τ ∈ Sn , and ci (1 6 i 6 n) in the same way as the case of g = sp(n, C). In the
Barbasch-Vogan algorithm, W is regarded as the Weyl group of the type Cn rather than Bn . So,
σ is attached to (c1 , ..., cn , −cn , ..., −c1 ). Again, we may apply the Robinson-Schensted algorithm
to the sequence (a1 , ..., an , −an , ...,
                                          −a1 ) directly and obtain a partition (k + 1, k − 1, 2n − 2k) of

     Finally, we consider the case of g = so(2n, C). In this case, we put λ′2 = λ2 − δωk + δ2 en .
Here, δ is a fixed real number such that 0 < δ < 21 . We define ai (1 6 i 6 n), bi (1 6 i 6 n),
τ ∈ Sn , and ci (1 6 i 6 n) in the same way as the case of g = sp(n, C). σ is attached to

As in §3, we write Θk = Π − {αk }, ωk = ωαk , ck = cαk , dk = dαk , etc.

4.1   Even parabolic subalgebras
Let u ∈ g be a nilpotent element. From the Jacobson-Morozov theorem, there is an sl2 -triple
(v, h, u) in g. Namely, we have [u, v] = h, [h, u] = 2u, and [h, v] = −2v. It is well known that any
eigenvalue of the operator ad(h) ∈ End(g) is an integer.Pu is called an even nilpotent element if
each eigenvalue of ad(h) is an even number. Put pu = i>0 {X ∈ g | [h, X] = iX}.
Definition 4.1.1. A parabolic subalgebra p is called even, if there exists an even nilpotent
element u such that p = pu .
   For an even parabolic subalgebra pu , the Richardson orbit Opu contains u.
   The following result is well-known. For example, it is an easy consequence of [Hesselink 1978]
p218 and [Yamashita 1986] Lemma 3.5.
Lemma 4.1.2. Let pΘ be an even parabolic subalgebra of g. Then, the moment map mΘ :
T ∗ XΘ → OpΘ is birational.

4.2   G2
In the regular integral case, homomorphisms between (not necessarily scalar) generalized Verma
modules are classified for G2 in [Boe-Collingwood 1990].
    I imagine in the case of G2 the classification of the homomorphisms between scalar generalized
Verma modules is well-known, but I would like to state the result for the completeness.
    Let g be a simple Lie algebra of the type G2 . Then, we may write Π = {α1 , α2 } such that
hα1 , α1 i > hα2 , α2 i.
Theorem 4.2.1. Let g be a simple Lie algebra of the type G2 and let k be 1 or 2. Then,
MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ N.

Proof. We see c1 = c2 = 21 , d1 = 32 , and d2 = 25 . Thus, for k = 1, 2, ρΘk + tωk is integral if and
only if t − 12 ∈ Z. For k = 1, 2, it is easy to see that wΘk w0 = w0 wΘk but they are not a Duflo
involution of W . Moreover, we have:
Lemma 4.2.2. Let k be 1 or 2. If ρΘk + tωk is singular and integral, then MΘk [t] is irreducible.
In particular, MΘk [ 21 ] is irreducible.

Proof. g has only three special nilpotent orbits, namely the regular nilpotent orbit, the subreg-
ular nilpotent orbit, and {0}. (Cf. [Carter 1985]) Hence, the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of any
infinite-dimensional irreducible constituent of MΘk [t] is dim nΘk = Dim(MΘk [t]), if ρΘk + tωk
is integral. On the other hand, the multiplicity (the Bernstein degree) of MΘk [t] is one. So, if
ρΘk + tωk is integral and singular, MΘk [t] is irreducible.  ✷
    We continue the proof of Theorem 4.2.1. From Lemma 4.2.2 and Lemma 2.2.6, we have
MΘk [− 21 − t] 6⊆ MΘk [ 21 + t] for all t ∈ N.
    For t ∈ Z, ρΘk + tωk is half-integral and its integral Weyl group is of type A2 × A2 . This
case, we easily see wΘk w0 is a Duflo involution of the integral Weyl group. Since ρΘk + tωk is



                                                 21
dominant and regular if t ∈ N − {0}, Theorem 1.4.2 implies MΘk [−1 − t] ⊆ MΘk [1 + t] for all
t ∈ N.  Q.E.D.

4.3    F4
For the simple algebra of the type F4 , [Boe-Collingwood] treated the regular integral case. The
half-integral case is somewhat easier, but I would like to mention the results for the completeness.
    We consider the root system ∆ for a simple Lie algebra g of the type F4 . (For example, see
[Knapp 2002] p691.) We can choose an orthonormal basis e1 , ..., e4 of h∗ such that
                                                                                        

         ∆ = {±ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 4} ∪ {±ei | 1 6 i 6 4} ∪       (±e1 ± e2 ± e3 ± e4 ) .
                                                                  2

We choose a positive system as follows.
                                                                                           
             +                                                        1
            ∆ = {ei ± ej | 1 6 i < j 6 4} ∪ {ei | 1 6 i 6 4} ∪          (e1 ± e2 ± e3 ± e4 ) .
                                                                      2

Put α1 = 21 (e1 − e2 − e3 − e4 ), α2 = e4 , α3 = e3 − e4 , and α4 = e2 − e3 . Then, Π = {α1 , ..., α4 }.

                                       1 − 2 ⇐ 3 − 4
                                           1
Since P = Q in this case, we have ck =     2   for 1 6 k 6 4.
   The result is:
Theorem 4.3.1. ((1) is due to [Lepowsky 1975a].)
  (1) MΘ1 [−t] ⊆ MΘ1 [t] if and only if t ∈ 12 N.
  (2) MΘ2 [−t] ⊆ MΘ2 [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
  (3) MΘ3 [−t] ⊆ MΘ3 [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
  (4) MΘ3 [−t] ⊆ MΘ3 [t] if and only if t ∈ 12 N.

Proof. (1) is proved in [Lepowsky 1975a] (Theorem 1.2). So, we consider the other cases.
    Since ck = 12 for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] implies t ∈ 21 N.
    For each k = 1, 3, 4, pΘk is an even parabolic subalgebra. (Cf. [Carter 1985] p401.) Hence,
MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for t ∈ N for k = 1, 3, 4.
    We consider the case of k = 2. ρΘ2 + tω2 is half-integral for t ∈ Z. The integral root system
∆ρΘ2 for ρΘ2 + tω2 (t ∈ N) is of the type A1 × B3 . Θ2 corresponds to the set of the long simple
roots in the B2 factor of ∆ρΘ2 and the simple root in the A1 -factor. Hence, Theorem 3.2.1 (2a),
Lemma 1.4.4, and Theorem 1.4.2 imply that wΘ2 w0 is a Duflo involution in the integral Weyl
group. So, Theorem 1.4.2 implies MΘ2 [−t] ⊆ MΘ2 [t] for t ∈ N.
    For k = 2, 3, we can prove that MΘk [ 21 ] is irreducible using Jantzen’s criterion (Theorem
2.2.11). Hence, Lemma 2.2.6 implies that MΘk [− 21 − t] 6⊆ MΘk [ 12 + t] for t ∈ N and k = 2, 3.
    For k = 4, ρΘk + ( 12 + t)ω4 is half-integral for t ∈ N. The integral root system ∆ρΘ2 for
ρΘ2 + tω2 (t ∈ N) is of the type A1 × B3 . In this case wΘ4 is the non-trivial element of the
A1 -factor of the integral Weyl group. So, it is a Duflo involution in the integral Weyl group and
we have MΘ4 [− 21 − t] ⊆ MΘ4 [ 12 + t] for t ∈ N.   Q.E.D.

     In this case, w0 is not contained in the center of the Weyl group. So, wΘ w0 = w0 wΘ may
fail for some Θ ⊆ Π. In fact, wΘk w0 = w0 wΘk holds for k = 3, 6, but it fails for k = 1, 2, 4, 5.
     Since the Dynkin diagram of E6 has a symmetry, the cases of Θ4 and Θ5 are similar to Θ2
and Θ1 , respectively. So, we only consider Θ1 , Θ2 , Θ3 , and Θ6 .
     We have:
Theorem 4.4.1. ((1) is due to [Boe 1985].)
  (1) MΘ1 [−t] ⊆ MΘ1 [t] if and only if t = 0.
  (2) MΘ2 [−t] ⊆ MΘ2 [t] if and only if t = 0.
  (3) MΘ3 [−t] ⊆ MΘ3 [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
  (4) MΘ6 [−t] ⊆ MΘ3 [t] if and only if t ∈ N.

Proof. (1) is proved in [Boe 1985]. So, we consider the other cases.
                                                            2                     2
    First, we prove (2). In this case, we have ρΘ = 3ω2 . We also have ρΘ ∈ Q and c2 = 32 .
Hence, MΘ2 [−t] ⊆ MΘ2 [t] implies t ∈ 23 N. If t ∈ 3N, then ρΘ2 + tω2 is integral.
    Assume that t − 23 ∈ 3N. Then, the integral root system of ρΘ2 + tω2 is of the type A1 × A5 .
The
P2 set of 1simple    roots is {α1 , α6 , α3 , α4 , α5 , β}. Here, β = α1 + 2α2 + 2α3 + α4 + α6 =
                    P5        1                 1
   i=1  κ + 2   ei +  i=3 κ − 2 ei + κ + 2 e6 . Among them, α1 is the simple root in the A1 -
factor.



                                                23
    For t ∈ 23 N, we denote by W(t) the integral Weyl group of ρΘ2 + tω3 . Let w0t be the longest
element of the integral Weyl group. We easily see that wΘ2 w0t is not an involution. We also see
ρΘ2 + tω3 is dominant regular for t ∈ 32 N − {0}. Since wΘ2 (ρΘ2 − tω3 ) = −(ρΘ2 + tω3 ), one of
the following two conditions must hold.
    (a) There is no w ∈ W(t) such that w(ρΘ2 + tω3 ) = ρΘ2 − tω3 .
    (b) wΘ2 w0t (ρΘ2 + tω3 ) = ρΘ2 − tω3 .
    If (a) holds, then MΘ2 [t] has an infinitesimal character different from that of MΘ2 [−t]. Hence,
we have MΘ2 [−t] 6⊆ MΘ2 [t].
    Assume (b) holds. Then, Theorem 1.4.2 implies that MΘ2 [−t] 6⊆ MΘ2 [t], since wΘ2 w0t is not
an involution.
    Next, we prove (3) and (4). Let k be either 3 or 6. Then we have wΘk w0 = w0 wΘk and pk
is an even parabolic subalgebra (see [Carter 1985] p402). Hence, Lemma 4.1.2 and Corollary
2.2.9 imply MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for all t ∈ N. Since ck = 21 in these case, we have only to show
MΘ2 [− 21 − t] 6⊆ MΘ2 [ 21 + t] for all t ∈ N. In this case, we can check the irreducibility of MΘk [ 12 ]
via Jantzen’s criterion (Theorem 2.2.11). So, from Lemma 2.2.6, we have the desired result. We
describe the computation briefly.
    First, we consider the case of k = 3. In this case d3 = 27 and ρΘ3 + 21 ω3 is integral. We put

we can find η ∈ ∆Θ3 such that hβ, ηi = 0. Hence, we have ΥΘ3 (sβ (ρΘ3 + 12 ω3 )) = 0. Moreover,
we have ΥΘ3 (sγ1 (ρΘ3 + 21 ω3 )) = −ΥΘ3 (ρΘ3 − 12 ω3 ) and ΥΘ3 (sγ2 (ρΘ3 + 21 ω3 )) = ΥΘ3 (ρΘ3 − 12 ω3 ).
Hence, we have
                                    X                   1
                                          ΥΘ3 (sβ (ρΘ3 + ω3 )) = 0.

We have:
Theorem 4.5.1. (The case of k = 1 is due to [Boe 1985].)
  (1) Assume k ∈ {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
  (2) Assume k ∈ {2, 4}. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ 12 N.

Proof. For the simple Lie algebra of the type E7 , w0 is contained in the center of the Weyl group.
Moreover, all the maximal parabolic subalgebras are even. (See [Carter 1985] p403-404.) So,
Lemma 4.1.2 and Corollary 2.2.9 imply that, for all 1 6 k 6 8, t ∈ N implies MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t].
Hence, we have only to take care of the case of t − 21 ∈ N.
    The case of k = 1 is due to [Boe 1985]. In fact MΘ1 [−t] 6⊆ MΘ1 [t] for t − 12 ∈ N.
    For the case k = 2, we have d2 = 7 and ω2 ∈ Q. The integral Weyl group for ρΘ2 + tω2
(t ∈ 21 + N) is of the type A1 × D6 . In fact, we have ΠρΘ2 +tω2 = {e3 + e4 } ∪ Θ2 . From Theorem
1.4.2 and Theorem 3.2.3, we have wΘ2 w0 is a Duflo involution of the integral Weyl group for
ρΘ2 + tω2 . So, Theorem 1.4.2, Lemma 2.2.6 imply that MΘ2 [−t] ⊆ MΘ2 [t] for t − 21 ∈ N.
    For the case k = 3, we have d3 = 5 and ω3 = 32 (e1 + e2 ) + e3 + e4 + e5 6∈ Q. So, we have
c3 = 1. Hence, MΘ3 [−t] 6⊆ MΘ3 [t] for t − 21 ∈ N.
    For the case k = 4, we have d4 = 4 and ω4 ∈ Q. The integral Weyl group for ρΘ4 + tω4
(t ∈ 21 + N) is of the type A1 × D6 . In fact, we have ΠρΘ4 +tω4 = {e5 + e6 } ∪ Θ4 . From Theorem
1.4.2 and Theorem 3.2.3, we have wΘ4 w0 is a Duflo involution of the integral Weyl group for
ρΘ4 + tω4 . So, Theorem 1.4.2, Lemma 2.2.6 imply that MΘ4 [−t] ⊆ MΘ4 [t] for t − 21 ∈ N.
    For the case k = 5, we have d5 = 7 and ω7 = e1 + e2 + 12 (e3 + e4 + e5 + e6 + e7 − e8 ) 6∈ Q.
So, we have c5 = 1. Hence, MΘ5 [−t] 6⊆ MΘ5 [t] for t − 12 ∈ N.
    For the cases k = 6 and k = 7, we have d6 = 11                17
                                                      2 and d7 = 2 . In this case, we can show the
irreducibility of MΘk [ 21 ] (k = 6, 7) via Jantzen’s criterion (Theorem 2.2.11). So, from Lemma
2.2.6, for k = 6, 7, we have MΘk [−t] 6⊆ MΘk [t] for t − 12 ∈ N. We describe the computation
briefly.

we can find η ∈ ∆Θ6 such that hβ, ηi = 0. Hence, we have ΥΘ6 (sβ (ρΘ6 + 21 ω6 )) = 0. Moreover, we

   We have:
Theorem 4.6.1.
  (1) Assume k ∈ {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ N.
  (2) Assume k ∈ {3, 5, 7}. Then, MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] if and only if t ∈ 21 N.

Proof. For any k, we have wΘk w0 = w0 wΘk since w0 is contained in the center of W . Hence,
Lemma 2.2.3 implies that MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t], only if t ∈ 21 N.
     Next we consider the case of t ∈ N. For k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}, pΘk is even (cf. [Carter 1985]
p405-406). In this case, Corollary 2.2.9 and Lemma 4.1.2 imply MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for t ∈ N.
If k = 5, we have d5 = 29 . So, ρΘ5 is not integral. A basis of integral root system for ρΘ5 is
Θ5 ∪ {e5 + e6 }. We see that the integral root system is of the type A1 × E7 . So, the problem
is reduced to the case of k = 3 in the type E7 . Hence, MΘ5 [−t] ⊆ MΘ5 [t] for t ∈ N such that
ρΘ5 + tω5 is dominant and regular. From Lemma 2.2.6, we have MΘ5 [−t] ⊆ MΘ5 [t] for all t ∈ N.
The case of k = 7 is similar to the case of k = 5. This time, a basis of the integral Weyl group
of ρΘ7 is Θ7 ∪ { 21 (e1 − e2 − e3 − e4 + e5 + e6 + e7 + e8 )} and the integral root system is of the
type A1 × E7 . Hence, the problem is reduced to the case of k = 5 in the type E7 .
     Next, we consider the case of t ∈ 21 + N.
     First, we consider the case of k = 3. In this case, ρΘ3 + tω3 is not integral for t ∈ 12 + N. A
basis of integral root system for ρΘ3 + 21 ω3 is Θ5 ∪ {e3 + e4 } and the integral root system is of
the type D8 . This time, the problem is reduced to the case of k = 3 in the type D8 .
     Next, we consider the case of k = 5, 7. In this case, ρΘk + tωk is integral for t ∈ 12 + N. The
special representation corresponding to a Richardson orbit can be constructed as a MacDonald
representation ([MacDonald 1972]). If k = 5 (resp. k = 7), then the numder of positive roots in
the Levi part of pΘk is 14 (resp. 22). Hence, the special representation occurs as component of
S 14 (h∗ ) (resp. S 22 (h∗ )) but not of S d (h∗ ) for d > 14 (resp. d > 22). Hence, from [Carter 1985]
p417-418, we see the family of the special representation consists of a single element. Hence,
Corollary 2.1.4, Lemma 2.2.6 and Lemma 2.2.7 inply that MΘk [−t] ⊆ MΘk [t] for t ∈ 21 + N.
     If k = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, we can prove that MΘk [ 12 ] is irreducible via Jantzen’s criterion. So, we
have MΘk [−t] 6⊆ MΘk [t] for t ∈ 21 + N. We describe the computation briefly.
     First, we consider the case of k = 1. In this case d1 = 29                   1
                                                                    2 and ρΘ1 + 2 ω1 is integral. We put

is denoted by Π(α). If α|aΘ 6= 0, then there exists a unique α̃ ∈ ∆+ such that Π(α) = Θ ∪ {α̃}.
If α ∈ ∆ satisfies α|aΘ 6= 0 and α = α̃, then we call α Θ-reduced. For α ∈ ∆+ , we denote by
WΘ (α) the Weyl group of (h∗ , ∆(α)). Clearly, WΘ ⊆ WΘ (α) ⊆ W . We denote by wα the longest
element of WΘ (α). We call α ∈ ∆ Θ-acceptable if wα wΘ = wΘ wα . We denote by ∆Θ          r the set of
                                         Θ  +     +       Θ             Θ
Θ-reduced Θ-acceptable roots. Put (∆r ) = ∆ ∩ ∆r . For α ∈ ∆r , we define
                                          σα = wα wΘ = wΘ wα .
Clearly, σα 2 = 1. For α ∈ ∆, we put
                                     Vα = {λ ∈ a∗Θ | hλ, αi = 0}.
   We denote by ωα ∈ a∗Θ ⊆ h∗ the fundamental weight for α with respect to the basis Π(α) =
Θ ∪ {α}. Namely ωα satisfies that hωα , βi = 0 for β ∈ Θ, hβ, α̌i = 1, and ωα |h∩c(g(α)) = 0.
Here, c(g(α)) is the center of g(α). We see that there is some positive real number a such that
ωα = aα|aΘ , since α|h∩c(g(α)) = 0. Hence, we have Vα = {λ ∈ a∗Θ | hλ, ωα i = 0}.
   We can easily see:

                                                   29
Lemma    5.1.1. Let α ∈ ∆Θ   r . Then, we have
  (1)                    ∗
         σα preserves aΘ .
  (2)    σα ∈ W (Θ). In particular, σα ρΘ = ρΘ .
  (3)    σα ωα = −ωα .
  (4)    σα |aΘ is the reflection with respect to Vα .
   For α ∈ (∆Θ  +
             r ) , we define
                                              X
                           g(α) = h +                gβ ,    pΘ (α) = g(α) ∩ pΘ .
                                            β∈∆(α)

Then, g(α) is a reductive Lie subalgebra of g whose root system is ∆(α) and pΘ (α) is a maximal
parabolic subalgebra
                   P of g(α).
    Put ρ(α) = 12 β∈∆+ (α) β, For ν ∈ a∗Θ , we denote by Cν the one-dimensional U (pΘ (α))-
module corresponding to ν. For ν ∈ a∗Θ we define a generalized Verma module for g(α) as
follows.
                                g(α)
                           MΘ          (ρΘ + ν) = U (g(α)) ⊗U (pΘ (α)) Cν−ρ(α) .

Then, we have:
Theorem 5.1.2. Let ν be an arbitrary element in Vα and let c be either 1 or 21 . Assume that
  g(α)                   g(α)
MΘ (ρΘ − ncωα ) ⊆ MΘ (ρΘ + ncωα ) for all n ∈ N. Then, we have MΘ (ρΘ + ν − ncωα ) ⊆
MΘ (ρΘ + ν + ncωα ) for all n ∈ N. (We call the above homomorphism of MΘ (ρΘ + ν − ncωα )
into MΘ (ρΘ + ν + ncωα ) an elementary homomorphism. )
                        g(α)                         g(α)
Proof. Assume that MΘ (ρΘ − ncωα ) ⊆ MΘ (ρΘ + ncωα ) for all n ∈ N. Remark that σα (ρΘ +
ncωα ) = ρΘ − ncωα . From Theorem 1.4.2, this implies that σα is a Duflo involution of the
integral Weyl group WρΘ +ncωα for a sufficiently large n.
    Put Qα,n = {ν ∈ Vα | ∆(α)ρΘ +ncωα = ∆ρΘ +ν+ncωα }. From Theorem 1.4.2, for sufficiently
large n ∈ N and ν ∈ Qα,n , we have MΘ (ρΘ + ν − ncωα ) ⊆ MΘ (ρΘ + ν + ncωα ), since we have
σα (ρΘ + ν + ncωα ) = ρΘ + ν − ncωα . We easily see ν − ncωα is strongly Θ-antidominant for all
n ∈ N. Applying Lemma 1.5.1 and the exactness of the translation functor, we can remove the
extra assumption that n is sufficiently large.
    On the other hand Qα,n is Zarisky dense in Vα (Cf. [Matumoto 1993] Lemma 3.2.2 (1)).
Moreover, we can prove that {ν ∈ a∗Θ | MΘ (ρΘ + ν − µ) ⊆ MΘ (ρΘ + ν)} is Zarisky closed in a∗Θ
for each µ ∈ a∗Θ in the same way as [Lepowsky 1975b] Lemma 5.4. Hence, for each ν ∈ Vα and
each n ∈ N, we have MΘ (ρΘ + ν − ncωα ) ⊆ MΘ (ρΘ + ν + ncωα ).       Q.E.D.

   Remark Taking this opportunity, I would like to fix an error in [Matumoto 1993]. In page
269 line 18, the definitions of g(α, c) and pS (α, c) are incorrect. g(α, c) should be an abstract
reductive Lie algebra associated with the pair (h, ∆α,c ). pS (α, c) should be the standard parabolic
subalgebra corresponding to Θ. Since ∆α,c need not be closed under the addition in ∆, g(α, c)
need not be a subalgebra of g.

5.2   Cn case
As an example, we describe elementary homomorphisms in the Cn case. Let g = sp(n, C). We
use the notation in the root system in 3.1.
   Let κ = (k1 , ..., ks ) be a finite sequence of positive integers such that k1 + · · · + ks 6 n. We
put ki∗ = k1 + · · · ki for 1 6 i 6 s and k0∗ = 0. We define a subset Θκ of Π as follows.

                                                                           if ks∗ < n,
                         
                            Π − {eki∗ − eki∗ +1 |1 6 i 6 s}
                 Θκ =                                                                  .
                            Π − ({eki∗ − eki∗ +1 |1 6 i 6 s − 1} ∪ {2en }) if ks∗ = n

Then the corresponding standard Levi subalgebra lΘκ is isomorphic to gl(k1 , C) ⊕ gl(k2 , C) ⊕
· · · ⊕ gl(ks , C) ⊕ sp(n − ks∗ , C). Here, we regard sp(0, C) as a trivial Lie algebra {0}. Obviously
any proper subsetP      of Π is written as the form of Θκ .
      We put ai = kj=1     i
                             eki−1
                                ∗ +j   (1 6 i 6 s)). Then, a1 , ..., as form a basis of a∗Θκ . We write
MΘκ [t1 , ..., ts ] for MΘκ (ρΘκ + t1 a1 + · · · + ts as ) for t1 , ..., ts ∈ C.
      We easily have:
Lemma 5.2.1.
  (1) If ks∗ < n, then
              κ
          (∆Θ  +
            r ) = {eki∗ − ekj∗ +1 | 1 ≤ i 6 j < s, ki = kj+1 } ∪ {eki∗ − eks∗ +1 | 1 ≤ i 6 s}

   (2)    If ks∗ = n, then
                  κ
             (∆Θ  +
               r ) = {eki∗ − ekj∗ +1 | 1 ≤ i 6 j < s, ki = kj+1 } ∪ {2eki∗ | 1 ≤ i 6 s}

   Combining [Boe 1985] 4.4 Theorem, Theorem 3.2.2, and Theorem 5.1.2, we have

Proposition 5.2.2. (1)        Let 1 6 p < q 6 s be such that ki = kj . If tp − tq ∈ N, we have
