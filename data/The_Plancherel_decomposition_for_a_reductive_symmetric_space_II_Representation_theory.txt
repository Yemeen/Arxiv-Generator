                                                     We obtain the Plancherel decomposition for a reductive symmetric
                                                  space in the sense of representation theory. Our starting point is the
                                                  Plancherel formula for spherical Schwartz functions, obtained in part I.
                                                  The formula for Schwartz functions involves Eisenstein integrals obtained
                                                  by a residual calculus. In the present paper we identify these integrals as
                                                  matrix coefficients of the generalized principal series.

1     Introduction
In this paper we establish the Plancherel decomposition for a reductive sym-
metric space X = G/H, in the sense of representation theory. Here G is a real
reductive group of Harish-Chandra’s class and H is an open subgroup of the
group Gσ of fixed points for an involution σ of G. This paper is a continuation
of the paper [12] in the sense that we derive the Plancherel decomposition from
its main result [12],Thm. 23.1, the Plancherel formula for the space C(X : τ ) of
τ -spherical Schwartz functions on X. Here (τ, Vτ ) is a finite dimensional unitary
representation of K, a σ-stable maximal compact subgroup of G. At the end
of the paper, we make a detailed comparison of our results with those of P.
Delorme [21].
    The results of this paper were found and announced in the fall of 1995, when
both authors were visitors of the Mittag–Leffler Institute in Djursholm, Sweden.
At the same time Delorme announced a proof of the Plancherel theorem. For
more historical comments, we refer the reader to the introduction of [12].
    Before giving a detailed outline of the results of this paper, we shall first give
some background and describe the main result of [12], which serves as the basis
for this paper. The space X carries an invariant measure dx; accordingly the
regular representation L of G in L2 (X) is unitary. The Plancherel decomposition
amounts to an explicit decomposition of L as a direct integral of irreducible
unitary representations of G. These representations will turn out to be discrete
series representations of X and generalized principal series representations of
the form
                            πQ,ξ,ν = IndG Q (ξ ⊗ ν ⊗ 1),                         (1.1)
with Q = MQ AQ NQ a σθ-stable parabolic subgroup of G with the indicated
Langlands decomposition, ξ a discrete series representation of the symmetric
space XQ : = MQ /MQ ∩ H, and ν a unitary character of AQ /AQ ∩ H. To keep
the exposition simple, we assume here, and in the rest of the introduction, that
the number of open H-orbits on Q\G is one. In general, there are finitely many
open orbits, parametrized by a set Q W of representatives, and then ξ should
be taken from the discrete series of the spaces XQ,v : = MQ /MQ ∩ vHv −1 , for
v ∈ Q W.
    Let θ be the Cartan involution associated with K; it commutes with σ. Let
aq be a maximal abelian subspace of the intersection of the −1 eigenspaces
for θ and σ in g, the Lie algebra of G. We denote by Pσ the collection of θσ-
stable parabolic subgroups of G containing Aq : = exp aq . For Q ∈ Pσ we put
aQq : = aQ ∩ aq . In [12] we defined a spherical Fourier transform FQ in terms of
a so called normalized Eisenstein integral

                              E ◦ (Q : ν) = Eτ◦ (Q : ν).

The Eisenstein integral is a D(X)-finite and 1 ⊗ τ -spherical function in C ∞ (X) ⊗
Hom(A2,Q , Vτ ), depending meromorphically on the parameter ν ∈ a∗QqC . Here
A2,Q = A2,Q (τ ) is defined as the space of Schwartz functions XQ → Vτ that
are τQ : = τ |K∩MQ -spherical and behave finitely under the algebra D(XQ ) of


                                          2
invariant differential operators on XQ . The space A2,Q is finite dimensional,
and inherits the Hilbert structure from the bigger space L2 (XQ : τQ ). Without
the simplifying assumption, A2,Q is defined as a finite direct sum of similar
function spaces for XQ,v , as v ∈ Q W.
     Let P0 be a fixed minimal element of Pσ . Then the Eisenstein integral
E ◦ (P0 : λ) is essentially obtained as a (sum of) matrix coefficient(s) of a K-
finite vector with an H-fixed distribution vector of a σ-minimal principal series
representation of the form (1.1) with Q = P0 , see [4] and [7].
     In contrast, for non-minimal Q ∈ Pσ the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (Q : ν) is
obtained from E ◦ (P0 : λ) by means of a residual calculus in the variable λ ∈ a∗qC ,
see [12], Eqn. (8.7) and Lemmas 13.16 and 13.10. In particular, for such Q it is
a priori not clear that the normalized Eisenstein integral E ◦ (Q : ν) is a matrix
coefficient of the generalized principal series representation (1.1).
     In terms of the Eisenstein integral, the spherical Fourier transform is defined
by the formula
                              Z
                   FQ f (ν) =     E ◦ (Q : −ν̄ : x)∗ f (x) dx ∈ A2,Q ,
                               X

for f ∈ C(X : τ ) and ν ∈ ia∗Qq ; see [12], § 19. The star indicates that the
adjoint of an endomorphism in Hom(A2,Q , Vτ ) is taken. The transform FQ is a
continuous linear map from C(X : τ ) into the space S(ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q of Euclidean
Schwartz functions on ia∗Qq with values in the finite dimensional Hilbert space
A2,Q . The wave packet transform JQ is defined as the adjoint of the Fourier
transform with respect to the natural L2 -type inner products on the spaces
involved; see [12], § 20. It is a continuous linear map S(ia∗Qq )⊗A2,Q → C(X : τ ),
given by the formula
                                    Z
                       JQ ϕ(x) =         E ◦ (Q : ν : x) ϕ(ν) dν,
                                   ia∗
                                     Qq


for ϕ ∈ S(ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q and x ∈ X. Here dν is Lebesgue measure on ia∗Qq ,
suitably normalized.
    Two parabolic subgroups P, Q ∈ Pσ are called associated if their σ-split
components aP q and aQq are conjugate under the Weyl group W of the root
system of aq in g. The notion of associatedness defines an equivalence relation
∼ on Pσ . Let Pσ be a choice of representatives in Pσ for the classes in Pσ / ∼ .
Then the Plancherel formula for functions in C(X : τ ) takes the form
                     X
                f=       [W : WQ∗ ] JQ FQ f,     (f ∈ C(X : τ )),
                      Q∈Pσ

with WQ∗ the normalizer in W of aQq . The operator [W : WQ∗ ]JQ FQ is a continu-
ous projection operator onto a closed subspace CQ (X : τ ) of C(X : τ ). Moreover,

                          C(X : τ ) = ⊕Q∈Pσ CQ (X : τ ),



                                          3
with orthogonal summands. It follows from the above that [W : WQ∗ ]1/2 FQ
extends to a partial isometry from L2 (X : τ ) to L2 (ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q . Its adjoint
                  1/2
extends [W : WQ∗ ] JQ to a partial isometry in the opposite direction.
    In the present paper, we build the Plancherel decomposition for (L, L2 (X))
from the above results for all τ. For this it is crucial to relate the Eisenstein
integral E ◦ (Q : ν) to the generalized principal series representations πQ,ξ,−ν .
    In [19], Delorme has defined a normalized Eisenstein integral 8 E ◦ (Q : ν) es-
sentially as a matrix coefficient of the generalized principal series. One way
to establish the wanted relationship of E ◦ (Q : ν) with the generalized principal
series would thus be to prove the following identity of meromorphic functions
in the variable ν ∈ a∗QqC :

                            E ◦ (Q : ν) = 8 E ◦ (Q : −ν).                      (1.2)

In view of the vanishing theorem of [11], the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (Q : ν) can
be uniquely characterized in terms of its annihilating ideal in D(X) and its
asymptotic behavior towards infinity on X; see [12], Def. 13.7 and Prop. 13.6.
The identity (1.2) would follow if not only the Eisenstein integral on the left-
hand side but also the Eisenstein integral on the right-hand side satisfied these
characterizing conditions. For the latter to be true one needs that, for ψ ∈ A2,Q ,
                                                                      hyp
the family 8 E ◦ (Q : ψ): ν 7→ 8 E ◦ (Q : −ν)ψ belongs to the space EQ    (X : τ ) of
                                                                 8 ◦
[12], Prop. 13.6. For this in turn, the full set of exponents of E (Q : ψ) in its
asymptotic expansion along P0 must be of a certain form; see [12], Def. 6.3.
We have not been able to deduce this type of information from Delorme’s work.
Nevertheless, by following a different strategy we have been able to establish
(1.2), but only at the end of the paper, in Corollary 11.21, after a relation of
our Eisenstein integrals with the principal series has been established.
     More precisely, the mentioned characterization of the Eisenstein integral
E ◦ (Q : ν) is used to construct certain embeddings of (g, K)-modules

                             πQ,ξ,−ν ֒→ (L, C ∞ (X)).                          (1.3)

The existence of these embeddings, on the level of (g, K)-modules, is sufficient
to establish the Plancherel decomposition in the sense of representation theory,
Theorem 10.9. Further details will be given at a later stage in this introduction.
    At the end of the paper we invoke the automatic continuity theorem, The-
orem 11.1, due to W. Casselman and N.R. Wallach, see [18] and [29], to show
that the embedding (1.3) extends to a G-homomorphism. This implies that our
Eisenstein integrals are essentially generalized matrix coefficients of K-finite and
H-fixed distribution vectors of principal series representations. From this infor-
mation combined with results of [16], the identity (1.2) can then be established.
    After this motivation, we shall now give an outline of the paper, in particular
describing how the Eisenstein integrals give rise to the embeddings (1.3).
    In Section 3 we show that the discrete part L2d (X : τ ) of L2 (X : τ ) is finite
dimensional. This fact can be derived from the description of the discrete series
by T. Oshima and T. Matsuki in [26]. We show that it can be obtained from

                                         4
[12] and weaker information on the discrete series, also due to [26], namely the
rank condition and the fact that the D(X)-characters of L2d (X) are real and
regular. The mentioned result implies that the parameter space A2,Q (τ ) of the
Eisenstein integral equals L2d (XQ : τQ ). Accordingly, it may be decomposed in
an orthogonal finite dimensional sum of isotypical subspaces A2,Q (τ )ξ , where
ξ ∈ X∧  Q,ds , the collection of discrete series for XQ .
     In Section 4 we explain the connection of the Eisenstein integrals with the
principal series. Let K   b be the unitary dual of K, i.e., the collection of equivalence
classes of irreducible unitary representations of K. If V is a locally convex space
equipped with a continuous representation of K, then by VK we denote the
subspace of K-finite vectors; for ϑ ⊂ K         b a finite subset we denote by Vϑ the
subspace of VK consisting of vectors whose K-types belong to ϑ. Let ϑ ⊂ K           b be
a finite subset. We define Vϑ to be the space of continuous functions K → C
that are left K-finite with types contained in the set ϑ. Moreover, we define
τϑ to be the restriction of the right regular representation of K to Vϑ . Let
δe : Vϑ → C be evalutation in e. Then F 7→ δe ◦ F is a natural isomorphism from
L2 (X : τϑ ) onto L2 (X)ϑ . Its inverse, called sphericalization, is denoted by ςϑ .
     For ξ ∈ X∧    Q,ds , we denote by V̄ (ξ) the space of continuous linear MQ -
equivariant maps Hξ → L2 (XQ ). This space is a finite dimensional Hilbert space.
We denote by L2 (K : ξ) the space of the induced representation IndK       K∩MQ (ξ|K∩MQ ).
It is well known that the induced representation (1.1) may be realized as a ν-
dependent representation in L2 (K : ξ), which we shall denote by πQ,ξ,ν as well;
this is the so-called compact picture of (1.1).
     If ϑ ⊂ K b is a finite subset, there is a natural isometry from V̄ (ξ)⊗L2 (K : ξ)ϑ
into A2,Q (τϑ ), denoted T 7→ ψT . We show in Section 4 that we may use the
Eisenstein integrals to define a map JQ,ξ,ν : V̄ (ξ) ⊗ L2 (K : ξ)K → C ∞ (X)K by
the formula
                            JQ,ξ,ν (T )(x) = δe [Eϑ◦ (Q : ν : x)ψT ].               (1.4)
Here ϑ ⊂ K b is any finite subset such that T ∈ V̄ (ξ)⊗C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ and E ◦ denotes
                                                                         ϑ
the Eisenstein integral with τ = τϑ . The map JQ,ξ,ν is a priori well-defined for ν
in the complement of the union of a certain set H(Q, ξ) of hyperplanes in a∗QqC .
This unio is disjoint from ia∗Qq .
    The main result of the section is Theorem 4.6. It asserts that H(Q, ξ) is
locally finite and that, for ν in the complement of ∪H(Q, ξ), the map JQ,ξ,ν
is (g, K)-equivariant for the infinitesimal representations associated with 1 ⊗
πQ,ξ,−ν and L. The proof of this result is given in the next two sections. In
the first of these we prepare for the proof by showing that πQ,ξ,ν is finitely
generated, with local uniformity in the parameter ν, see Proposition 5.1. This
result is needed for the proof of the local finiteness of H(Q, ξ).
    In Section 6 the (g, K)-equivariance of the map JQ,ξ,ν is established. The
K-equivariance readily follows from the definitions. For the g-equivariance
it is necessary to compute derivatives of the Eisenstein integral of the form
LX Eτ◦ (Q : ν)ψ, for ψ ∈ A2,Q (τ ) and X ∈ g. The computation is achieved by
introducing a meromorphic family of spherical functions Fe : a∗QqC × X → g∗C ⊗ Vτ



                                          5
by the formula
                        Feν (x)(Z) = LZ [Eτ◦ (Q : ν : · )ψ](x),
for ν ∈ a∗QqC , x ∈ X and Z ∈ gC . The function Feν is τe-spherical, with τe: =
Ad∨ K ⊗ τ and AdK : = Ad|K . It has the same annihilating ideal in D(X) as the
Eisenstein integral Eτ◦ (Q : ν)ψ. Moreover, its asymptotic behavior on X can be
expressed in terms of that of Eτ◦ (Q : ν). By the mentioned characterization of
Eisenstein integrals this enables us to show that Feν equals an Eisenstein integral
of the form Eτe◦ (Q : ν)∂Q (ν)ψ, with ∂Q (ν) an explicitly given differential operator
A2,Q (τ ) → A2,Q (e  τ ), see Theorem 6.12. The g-equivariance of JQ,ξ,ν is then
obtained by computing the action of ∂Q (ν) on ψT , for T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ ;
see Lemma 6.13 and Proposition 6.15. At the end of the section we complete the
proof of Theorem 4.6 by establishing the local finiteness of H(Q, ξ), combining
the results of Sections 5 and 6; see Proposition 6.16.
    In Section 7 we define a Fourier transform f 7→ fˆ(Q : ξ : ν) from Cc∞ (X)K
to V̄ (ξ) ⊗ L2 (K : ξ)K by transposition of the map JQ,ξ,−ν̄ . It is given by the
formula                                     Z
                     hfˆ(Q : ξ : ν) | T i =   f (x)JQ,ξ,−ν̄ (T )(x) dx
                                          X

and intertwines the (g, K)-module of L with that of 1 ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν . In view of (1.4),
the transform f 7→ fˆ is related to the spherical Fourier transform by the formula

                      hfˆ(Q : ξ : ν) | T i = hFQ (ςϑ f )(ν) | ψT i,             (1.5)

for f ∈ Cc∞ (X)ϑ .
    The established relation (1.5) combined with the spherical Plancherel for-
mula implies that the Fourier transform f 7→ fˆ(Q : ξ : ν) defines an isometry
from L2 (X) into the direct integral
                      X X                    Z
                π=                [W : WQ∗ ]   1 ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν dν,            (1.6)

                              Q,ds



realized in a Hilbert space L2 . The continuous parts of this direct integral are
studied in Section 8. In Section 9 it is first shown, in Theorem 9.5, that the
Fourier transform f 7→ fˆ extends to an isometry F from L2 (X) into L2 . More-
                                                                 ∞
over, its restriction to Cc∞ (X)K is a (g, K)-module map into L2 . By an argu-
ment involving continuity and density, it is then shown that F is G-equivariant,
see Theorem 9.6. At this stage we have established that F maps the regular
representation L isometrically into a direct integral decomposition. For this to
give the Plancherel decomposition, we need to show that the image of F is a
direct integral with representations that are irreducible and mutually inequiva-
lent outside a set of Plancherel measure zero. This is done in Lemma 10.5 and
Proposition 10.8. In the process we use results of F. Bruhat and Harish-Chandra
on irreducibility and equivalence of unitarily parabolically induced representa-
tions, see Theorem 10.7. The Plancherel theorem is formulated in Theorem
10.9. Finally, in Theorem 10.11 a precise description of the image of F is given.

                                            6
    At this point it is still not clear that our description of the Plancherel de-
composition uses the same parametrizations as the one in Delorme’s paper [21].
It is the object of the last section to show that this is indeed the case. As said,
a key idea is to use the automatic continuity theorem, Theorem 11.1, due to
Casselman and Wallach, see [18] and [29]. It implies that the map JQ,ξ,ν has a
continuous linear extension, hence can be realized by taking the matrix coeffi-
cient with an H-fixed distribution vector of IndG  Q (ξ ⊗ ν ⊗ 1). By means of the
description of such vectors in [16], combined with an asymptotic analysis, it is
shown that our Eisenstein integral is related to Delorme’s by the identity (1.2),
see Corollary 11.21.
    Finally, the constants [W : WQ∗ ] occurring in our formula (1.6) differ from
those in the similar formula of Delorme. This is due to different choices of
normalizations of measures, as is explained in the final part of the paper.


2    Notation and preliminaries
Throughout this paper, we use all notation and preliminaries from [12], Sect. 2.
In particular, G is a group of Harish-Chandra’s class, σ an involution of G and
H an open subgroup of Gσ , the group of fixed points for σ. The associated
reductive symmetric space is denoted by
                                    X = G/H.
All occurring measures will be normalized according to the conventions de-
scribed in [12], end of Section 5.
    Apart from the references just given, we shall give precise references to [12]
for additional notation, definitions and results.


3    A property of the discrete series
In this section we discuss an important result on the discrete part of L2 (X),
which is a consequence of the classification of the discrete series by T. Oshima
and T. Matsuki in [26]. In our approach to the Plancherel formula via the
residue calculus, we obtain it as a consequence of the rank condition and the
regularity of the infinitesimal character, also due to [26], see [12], Rem. 16.2.
     In the rest of this section we assume that (τ, Vτ ) is a finite dimensional
unitary representation of K. A function f : X → Vτ is called τ -spherical if
f (kx) = τ (k)f (x), for all x ∈ X and k ∈ K. The Hilbert space of square inte-
grable τ -spherical functions is denoted by L2 (X : τ ). Its discrete part, denoted
L2d (X : τ ) is defined as in [12], § 12. The Fréchet space of τ -spherical Schwartz
functions, denoted C(X : τ ), is defined as in [12], Eqn. (12.1). The subspace of
D(X)-finite functions in C(X : τ ) is denoted by A2 (X : τ ).
Proposition 3.1 Let (τ, Vτ ) be a finite dimensional unitary representation of
K. Then
                          L2d (X : τ ) = A2 (X : τ ).                    (3.1)

                                         7
Moreover, each of the spaces above is finite dimensional.

Proof: By the reasoning at the end of the proof of Lemma 12.6 in [12] it follows
that the space on the right-hand side of (3.1) is contained in the space on the
left-hand side. If the center of G is not compact modulo H, then it follows from
[26], see [12], Thm. 16.1, that X has no discrete series. Hence, L2d (X) = 0 and
we obtain (3.1).
    On the other hand, if G has a compact center modulo H the result is part
of [12], Lemma 12.6.                                                           
    If (ξ, Hξ ) is an irreducible unitary representation of G, let HomG (Hξ , L2 (X))
denote the space of G-equivariant continuous linear maps from Hξ into L2 (X).
This space is non-trivial if and only if (the class of) ξ belongs to X∧        ds , the
collection of equivalence classes of discrete series representations of X. If ξ ∈ X∧ ds ,
then the mentioned space is finite dimensional, by the finite multiplicity of the
discrete series, see [1], Thm. 3.1.
    For any irreducible unitary representation ξ, the canonical map from the
tensor product HomG (Hξ , L2 (X)) ⊗ Hξ to L2 (X) is an embedding, which is G-
equivariant for the representations 1 ⊗ ξ and L, respectively. We denote its
image by L2 (X)ξ and equip the space HomG (Hξ , L2 (X)) with the unique inner
product that turns the mentioned embedding into an isometric G-equivariant
isomorphism
                                                       ≃
                     mξ : HomG (Hξ , L2 (X)) ⊗ Hξ −→ L2 (X)ξ .                    (3.2)
Obviously the space on the right-hand side of (3.2) depends on ξ through its
class [ξ], and will therefore also be indicated with index [ξ] in place of ξ.
    With the notation just introduced, it follows that

                              L2d (X) = ⊕
                                        b ω∈X∧ L2 (X)ω ,
                                             ds
                                                                                   (3.3)

with orthogonal summands. Here and elsewhere, the hat over the summation
symbol indicates that the closure of the algebraic direct sum is taken.
    If ω is an equivalence class of an irreducible unitary representation of G, we
write L2 (X : τ )ω : = L2 (X : τ ) ∩ [L2 (X)ω ⊗ Vτ ]. It is readily seen that this space
is non-trivial if and only if ω belongs to X∧  ds and has a K-type in common with
the contragredient of τ. The collection of ω with this property is denoted by
X∧ds (τ ).

Lemma 3.2 The collection X∧
                          ds (τ ) is finite. Moreover,

                        L2d (X : τ ) = ⊕ω∈X∧ds (τ ) L2 (X : τ )ω ,                 (3.4)

where the direct sum is orthogonal and all the summands are finite dimensional.

Proof: That the direct sum decomposition is orthogonal and has closure
L2d (X : τ ) follows from the similar properties of (3.3). The space on the left-
hand side of (3.4) is finite dimensional, by Proposition 3.1. Since all summands
on the right-hand side are non-trivial, the collection parametrizing these sum-
mands is finite.                                                               

                                            8
Remark 3.3 It follows from Proposition 3.1 that the spaces L2 (X : τ )ω , for ω ∈
X∧ds , are contained in A2 (X : τ ); we therefore also denote them by A2 (X : τ )ω .
Note that L2 (X : τ )ω = 0 for ω an irreducible unitary representation of G that
does not belong to X∧  ds . Accordingly, we put A2 (X : τ )ω = 0 for such ω. In view
of what has been said, the decomposition (3.4) may be rewritten as

                       A2 (X : τ ) = ⊕ω∈X∧ds (τ ) A2 (X : τ )ω .              (3.5)

    Let C(K)K denote the space of right K-finite continous functions on K. If
                        b the unitary dual of K, then by C(K)ϑ we denote the
ϑ is a finite subset of K,
subspace of C(K)K consisting of functions with right K-types contained in the
              b then δ ∨ denotes the contragredient representation. Accordingly,
set ϑ. If δ ∈ K,
we put ϑ : = {δ ∨ | δ ∈ ϑ}. We define
           ∨


                                  Vϑ : = C(K)ϑ∨                               (3.6)

and equip this space with the restriction of the right regular representation
of K; this restriction is denoted by τϑ . We endow Vϑ with the L2 (K)-inner
product defined by means of normalized Haar measure. By δe we denote the
map Vϑ → C, ϕ 7→ ϕ(e).

Lemma 3.4 Let E be a complete locally convex space equipped with a contin-
uous representation of K. Then the map I ⊗ δe restricts to a topological linear
isomorphism from (E ⊗ Vϑ )K onto Eϑ . If E is equipped with a continuous
pre-Hilbert structure for which K acts unitarily, then the isomorphism is an
isometry. In particular, this yields natural isometries

                L2 (X : τϑ ) ≃ L2 (X)ϑ ,   Cc∞ (X : τϑ ) ≃ Cc∞ (X)ϑ ,

where the last two spaces are equipped with the inner products inherited from the
first two spaces.

Proof: This is well known and easy to prove.                                      
    The inverse of the isomorphism I ⊗ δe will be denoted by ς = ςϑ ; see [7],
text before Lemma 5, for similar notation. Given a finite subset ϑ ⊂ K   b we shall
        ∧          ∧
write Xds (ϑ) for Xds (τϑ ), the set of discrete series representations that have a
K-type contained in ϑ. The following result is now an immediate consequence
of Lemma 3.2.
                      b be a finite set of K-types. Then X∧ (ϑ) is a finite
Corollary 3.5 Let ϑ ⊂ K                                   ds
set.

   We end this section with two simple relations between ςϑ and ςϑ′ , for finite
subsets ϑ, ϑ′ ⊂ K b with ϑ ⊂ ϑ′ . Let E be a complete locally convex space
equipped with a continuous representation of K. We denote by iϑ′ ,ϑ : Eϑ → Eϑ′
the natural inclusion map and by Pϑ,ϑ′ : Eϑ′ → Eϑ the K-equivariant projection
map. Likewise, the inclusion map Vϑ → Vϑ′ and the K-equivariant projection

                                           9
Vϑ′ → Vϑ (relative to τϑ′ , τϑ ) are denoted by iϑ′ ,ϑ and Pϑ,ϑ′ , respectively. By
K-equivariance, the maps I ⊗ iϑ′ ,ϑ and I ⊗ Pϑ,ϑ′ induce maps

I ⊗ iϑ′ ,ϑ : (E ⊗ Vϑ )K → (E ⊗ Vϑ′ )K ,               I ⊗ Pϑ,ϑ′ : (E ⊗ Vϑ′ )K → (E ⊗ Vϑ )K .

Lemma 3.6 Let notation be as above. Then

           ςϑ′ ◦ (I ⊗ iϑ′ ,ϑ ) = iϑ′ ,ϑ ◦ ςϑ ,        ςϑ ◦ (I ⊗ Pϑ,ϑ′ ) = Pϑ,ϑ′ ◦ ςϑ′ .

Proof: The first identity is immediate from the definitions. The second identity
follows from the first by using that the maps Pϑ,ϑ′ : Eϑ′ → Eϑ and Pϑ,ϑ′ : Vϑ′ →
Vϑ may both be characterized by the identities Pϑ,ϑ′ ◦ iϑ′ ,ϑ = I and Pϑ,ϑ′ ◦ iϑ′ ,ϑ′ \ϑ =
0.                                                                                   


4     Eisenstein integrals and induced representa-
      tions
Let Q ∈ Pσ . We denote by X∧   Q,∗,ds the collection of equivalence classes of unitary
irreducible representations ξ ∈ MQ such that ξ is a discrete series representation
of XQ,v , for some v ∈ NK (aq ).
     In this section we describe the relation of the normalized Eisenstein integral
E ◦ (Q : ν) with the induced representations IndG                             ∗
                                                   Q (ξ ⊗ ν ⊗ 1), where ν ∈ aQqC and
       ∧                                                     ∧
ξ ∈ XQ,∗,ds . In the rest of this section we assume ξ ∈ XQ,∗,ds to be fixed.
     Let Q W ⊂ NK (aq ) be a choice of representatives for WQ \W/WK∩H , see [12],
text after Eqn. (2.2). For v ∈ Q W, we equip XQ,v with the left MQ -invariant
measure dxQ,v , specified at the end of [12], Section 5. Moreover, we define
V̄ (Q, ξ, v) = V̄ (ξ, v) by

                           V̄ (ξ, v): = HomMQ (Hξ , L2 (XQ,v )).                          (4.1)

As mentioned in Section 3, this space is finite dimensional. In accordance with
the mentioned section, we equip it with the unique inner product that turns the
natural map
                                            ≃
                    mξ,v : V̄ (ξ, v) ⊗ Hξ −→ L2 (XQ,v )ξ ,                 (4.2)
into an isometric MQ -equivariant isomorphism. We define the formal direct
sums
           V̄ (ξ): = ⊕v∈Q W V̄ (ξ, v), L2Q,ξ : = ⊕v∈Q W L2 (XQ,v )ξ  (4.3)
and equip them with the direct sum inner products. The first of these direct
sums will also be denoted by V̄ (Q, ξ). The second of these direct sums is a
unitary MQ -module. The direct sum of the maps mξ,v as v ranges over Q W is
an isometric isomorphism
                                                         ≃
                               mξ : V̄ (ξ) ⊗ Hξ −→ L2Q,ξ                                  (4.4)

that intertwines the natural MQ -representations.

                                                 10
Remark 4.1 If Q is minimal, then X∧                                      c
                                          Q,∗,ds coincides with the set Mps , defined
                            Q
in [3], p. 368. Moreover, W = W is a choice of representatives for W/WK∩H
                                           −1
in NK (aq ). If v ∈ W, and η ∈ HξM∩vHv , then the map jη : Hξ → L2 (M/M ∩
vHv −1 ), defined by jη (v)(m) = hv | ξ(m)η)i, is an M -equivariant map. More-
over, η 7→ jη defines an anti-linear map from V (ξ, v) onto HomM (Hξ , L2 (M/M ∩
vHv −1 )). This gives an identification of V (ξ, v) with V̄ (ξ, v). We recall from [3],
                                                  −1
p. 378, that we equipped V (ξ, v) = HξM∩vHv with the restriction of the in-
ner product from Hξ . By the Schur orthogonality relations this implies that
the inner product on V (ξ, v) coincides with dim(ξ) times the inner product on
V̄ (ξ, v). Let V (ξ) be defined as in [3], Eqn. (5.1). Then V (ξ) ≃ V̄ (ξ) and the
inner product on V (ξ) coincides with dim(ξ) times the inner product on V̄ (ξ).

  For ν ∈ a∗QqC , let L2 (Q : ξ : ν) denote the space of measurable functions
G → Hξ , transforming according to the rule

    ϕ(manx) = aν+ρQ ξ(m) ϕ(x),        (x ∈ G, (m, a, n) ∈ MQ × AQ × NQ ),
               R
and satisfying K kϕ(k)k2ξ dk < ∞. As usual we identify measurable functions
that are equal almost everywhere. The space L2 (Q : ξ : ν) is a Hilbert space for
the inner product given by
                                   Z
                         hϕ | ψi =   hϕ(k) | ψ(k)iξ dk.                     (4.5)
                                       K

The restriction of the right regular representation of G to this space is denoted
by IndG
      Q (ξ ⊗ ν ⊗ 1), or more briefly by πQ,ξ,ν = πξ,ν .
   Let C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν) denote the subspace of L2 (Q : ξ : ν) consisting of functions
that are smooth G → Hξ∞ . This subspace is G-invariant; the associated G-
representation in it is continuous for the usual Fréchet topology.

Remark 4.2 It follows from [13], § III.7, that the Fréchet G-module C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν)
equals the G-module of smooth vectors for the representation πQ,ξ,ν , equipped
with its natural Fréchet topology.

    It will be convenient to work with the compact picture of the induced rep-
resentation πξ,ν . Let L2 (K : ξ) denote the space of square integrable functions
ϕ: K → Hξ that transform according to the rule

                    ϕ(mk) = ξ(m)ϕ(k),           (k ∈ K, m ∈ KQ ).                (4.6)

Multiplication induces a diffeomorphism Q ×KQ K ≃ G. Hence, restriction
to K induces an isometry from L2 (Q : ξ : ν) onto L2 (K : ξ). This isometry re-
stricts to a topological linear isomorphism from C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν) onto the subspace
C ∞ (K : ξ) of functions in L2 (K : ξ) that are smooth K → Hξ∞ , where the latter
space is equipped with the usual Fréchet topology. Via the isometric restric-
tion map we transfer πξ,ν to a G-representation in L2 (K : ξ), also denoted by
πQ,ξ,ν = πξ,ν .

                                           11
     Let (τ, Vτ ) be a finite dimensional unitary representation of K. We define

                        L2 (K : ξ : τ ): = [L2 (K : ξ) ⊗ Vτ ]K .               (4.7)

By finite dimensionality of τ, the space in (4.7) is finite dimensional and con-
tained in C(K, Hξ ) ⊗ Vτ .
    Let eve denote the evalutation map C(K, Hξ ) → Hξ , ϕ 7→ ϕ(e), and let
eve ⊗ I denote the induced map L2 (K : ξ : τ ) → Hξ ⊗ Vτ .

Lemma 4.3
 (a) The map eve ⊗I defines an isometric isomorphism from L2 (K : ξ : τ ) onto
     the space (Hξ ⊗ Vτ )KQ .
 (b) The space L2 (K : ξ : τ ) equals its subspace C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ): = [C ∞ (K : ξ) ⊗
     Vτ ]K .

Proof: Observe that L2 (K : ξ) is the representation space for IndK      KQ (ξ|KQ ).
Hence (a) follows by Frobenius reciprocity. It is readily checked that eve ⊗I maps
C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ) onto (Hξ∞ ⊗ Vτ )KQ . The latter space equals (HξKQ ⊗ Vτ )KQ =
(Hξ ⊗ Vτ )KQ ; hence (b) follows.                                                
     Given T ∈ V̄ (ξ)⊗L2 (K : ξ : τ ) we may now define the element ψT ∈ L2Q,ξ ⊗Vτ
by
                         ψT = [mξ ⊗ I] ◦ [I ⊗ eve ⊗ I](T ).
We agree to denote the map eve ⊗ I: L2 (K : ξ : τ ) → (Hξ ⊗ Vτ )KQ also by
ϕ 7→ ϕ(e). With this notation, if T = η ⊗ϕ, with η ∈ V̄ (ξ) and ϕ ∈ L2 (K : ξ : τ ),
then
                     ψT,v = [ηv ⊗ I](ϕ(e)),     (v ∈ Q W).                   (4.8)
We recall from Remark 3.3, applied to the space XQ,v in place of X, for v ∈ Q W,
that [L2 (XQ,v )ξ ⊗ Vτ ]KQ ≃ A2 (XQ,v : τQ )ξ , naturally and isometrically. The
space
                      A2,Q (τ )ξ : = ⊕v∈Q W A2 (XQ,v : τQ )ξ                 (4.9)
is a subspace of the space A2,Q (τ ), defined in [12], Eqn. (13.1), as the similar
direct sum without the indices ξ on the summands. It follows from the above
discussion combined with (4.3) that summation over Q W naturally induces an
isometric isomorphism

                           (L2Q,ξ ⊗ Vτ )KQ ≃ A2,Q (τ )ξ ,                     (4.10)

via which we shall identify.

Lemma 4.4 The map T 7→ ψT is an isometry from V̄ (ξ) ⊗ L2 (K : ξ : τ ) onto
A2,Q (τ )ξ .




                                          12
Proof: It follows from Lemma 4.3 that

        I ⊗ eve ⊗ I: V̄ (ξ) ⊗ L2 (K : ξ : τ ) → V̄ (ξ) ⊗ [Hξ ⊗ Vτ ]KQ               (4.11)

is an isometric isomorphism. The map mξ ⊗I is an isometry from V̄ (ξ)⊗Hξ ⊗Vτ
onto L2Q,ξ ⊗ Vτ , which intertwines the KQ -actions 1 ⊗ ξ|KQ ⊗ τQ and L|KQ ⊗ τQ .
Therefore, it induces an isometry between the subspaces of KQ -invariants, which
by (4.10) is identified with an isometry
                                                        ≃
                   mξ ⊗ I: V̄ (ξ) ⊗ [Hξ ⊗ Vτ ]KQ −→ A2,Q (τ )ξ .                    (4.12)

Since T 7→ ψT is the composition of (4.11) with (4.12), the result follows.             
   It follows from Lemma 3.4 that

                             L2 (K : ξ : τϑ ) ≃ L2 (K : ξ)ϑ ,

with an isometric isomorphism. The latter space is equal to C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ , in
view of Lemmas 4.3 (b) and 3.4. Accordingly, the map T 7→ ψT , defined for
τ = τϑ , may naturally be viewed as an isometric isomorphism
                                                            ≃
              T 7→ ψT ,       V̄ (Q, ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ −→ A2,Q (τϑ )ξ .             (4.13)

Moreover, it is given by the following formula, for T = η ⊗ ϕ ∈ V̄ (Q, ξ) ⊗
C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ ;
                      prv ψT = ηv (ϕ(e)),   (v ∈ Q W).
     We now come to the connection with the normalized Eisenstein integral
Eτ◦ (Q : ν) = E ◦ (Q : ν), defined as in [12], Def. 13.7. The Eisenstein inte-
gral is meromorphic in the variable ν ∈ a∗QqC , as a function with values in
C ∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(A2,Q , Vτ ). If ψ ∈ A2,Q , we agree to write E ◦ (Q : ψ : ν : · ) =
E ◦ (Q : ν : · )ψ. Then E ◦ (Q : ψ : ν) ∈ C ∞ (X : τ ), for generic ν ∈ a∗QqC .
     We need a ‘functorial’ property of the normalized Eisenstein integral that we
shall now describe. Let (τ ′ , Vτ ′ ) be a second finite dimensional unitary represen-
tation of K, and let S: Vτ → Vτ ′ be a K-equivariant linear map. Then via action
on the last tensor component, S naturally induces linear maps C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ) →
C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ′ ), A2,Q (τ )ξ → A2,Q (τ ′ )ξ and C ∞ (X : τ ) → C ∞ (X : τ ′ ) that we all
denote by I ⊗ S.

Lemma 4.5 Let S: Vτ → Vτ ′ be a K-equivariant map as above.
 (a) Let T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ). Then ψ[I⊗I⊗S]T = [I ⊗ S]ψT .
 (b) Let ψ ∈ A2,Q (τ ). Then

                       [I ⊗ S]Eτ◦ (Q : ψ : ν) = Eτ◦′ (Q : [I ⊗ S]ψ : ν),

      as a meromorphic C ∞ (X : τ )-valued identity in the variable ν ∈ a∗QqC .



                                            13
Proof: (a) is a straightforward consequence of the definitions. Assertion (b)
follows from the characterization of the Eisenstein integral in [12], Def. 13.7.
More precisely, it follows from the mentioned definition and [12], Prop. 13.6
                                                    hyp
(a), that the family f = E ◦ (Q : ψ) belongs to EQ      (X : τ ). See [12], Def. 6.6,
for the definition of the latter space. Moreover, still by [12], Prop. 13.6, for
ν in a non-empty open subset Ω of a∗QqC , each v ∈ Q W and all X ∈ aQq and
m ∈ XQ,v,+ ,
                        qν−ρQ (Q, v | fν , X, m) = ψv (m).                    (4.14)
It readily follows from the definitions that g: (ν, x) 7→ S(f (ν, x)) belongs to
  hyp
EQ    (X : τ ′ ); moreover, (4.14) implies that

             qν−ρQ (Q, v | gν , X, m) = S(ψv (m)) = [prv [I ⊗ S]ψ](m),

for all ν ∈ Ω, each v ∈ Q W, and all X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ . In view of [12],
Def. 13.7 and Prop. 13.6 (a), this implies that g = E ◦ (Q : [I ⊗ S]ψ).     
     If ϑ ⊂ Kb is a finite subset and ψ ∈ A2,Q (τϑ ), we denote the associated nor-
malized Eisenstein integral Eτ◦ϑ (Q : ψ : ν) also by Eϑ◦ (Q : ψ : ν). This Eisenstein
integral is a smooth τϑ -spherical function, depending meromorphically on the
parameter ν ∈ a∗QqC .
     Lemma 4.5 implies an obvious relation between the Eisenstein integrals
Eϑ◦ (Q : ψ : ν) for different subsets ϑ. If ϑ ⊂ ϑ′ are finite subsets of K,  b then
Vϑ ⊂ Vϑ′ . The associated inclusion map is denoted by iϑ′ ,ϑ ; it intertwines τϑ
with τϑ′ . From Lemmas 3.6 and 4.5 (a) it follows that

          ψ[I⊗iϑ′ ,ϑ ]T   = ψ[I⊗I⊗iϑ′ ,ϑ ][I⊗ςϑ ]T
                          = [I ⊗ iϑ′ ,ϑ ]ψT ,        (T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ ).   (4.15)

Moreover, from Lemma 4.5 (b) it follows that

 Eϑ◦′ (Q : [I ⊗ iϑ′ ,ϑ ]ψ : ν) = [I ⊗ iϑ′ ,ϑ ]Eϑ◦ (Q : ψ : ν),    (ψ ∈ A2,Q (τϑ )). (4.16)

We have similar formulas for the K-equivariant projection operator Pϑ,ϑ′ : Vϑ′ →
Vϑ . From Lemmas 3.6 and 4.5 it follows that

      ψ[I⊗I⊗Pϑ,ϑ′ ]T = [I ⊗ Pϑ,ϑ′ ]ψT ,          (T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ′ ),      (4.17)

and

 Eϑ◦ (Q : [I ⊗ Pϑ,ϑ′ ]ψ : ν) = [I ⊗ Pϑ,ϑ′ ]Eϑ◦′ (Q : ψ : ν),      (ψ ∈ A2,Q (τϑ′ )). (4.18)

    We recall from [12], § 4, that a Σr (Q)-hyperplanes in a∗QqC is a hyperplane
of the form (α⊥ )C + ξ, with α ∈ Σr (Q) and ξ ∈ a∗QqC . The hyperplane is said to
be real if ξ may be chosen from a∗Qq . If ϑ ⊂ K    b is a finite subset, then by [12],
Prop. 13.14, there exists a locally finite collection H of real Σr (Q)-hyperplanes in
a∗QqC such that for each T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ the function ν 7→ Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : ν)
has a singular locus contained in ∪H. We denote by H(Q, ξ, ϑ) the minimal

                                              14
collection with this property. It follows from the definition just given that ϑ ⊂
ϑ′ ⇒ H(Q, ξ, ϑ) ⊂ H(Q, ξ, ϑ′ ). Let H(Q, ξ) denote the union of the collections
                                                                 b Then
H(Q, ξ, ϑ), as ϑ ranges over the collection of finite subsets of K.

                              ia∗Qq ∩ ∪H(Q, ξ) = ∅,                          (4.19)

by the regularity theorem for the normalized Eisenstein integral, see [12], Thm. 18.8.
    For ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ), we define the linear map

                JQ,ξ,ν = Jξ,ν : V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)K → C ∞ (X)K

by
                Jξ,ν (T )(x) = Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : ν : x)(e),   (x ∈ X),           (4.20)
        b a finite subset and T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ . This definition is unam-
for ϑ ⊂ K
biguous in view of (4.15) and (4.16).

Theorem 4.6 Let Q ∈ Pσ and ξ ∈ X∧         Q,∗,ds . The collection H(Q, ξ) consists
of real Σr (Q)-hyperplanes and is locally finite. Its union is disjoint from ia∗Qq .
Let ν ∈ a∗QqC be in the complement of this union. Then JQ,ξ,ν is a (g, K)-
intertwining map from V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)K , equipped with the induced repre-
sentation 1 ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν , to C ∞ (X)K , equipped with the (g, K)-module structure
induced by the left regular representation of G in C ∞ (X).

   The proof of this theorem will be given in the next two sections. In Section 5
we investigate uniformity of generators for πQ,ξ,ν relative to the parameter ν. In
Section 6 we shall investigate the effect of left differentiations on left spherical
functions.


5    Generators of induced representations
In this section we show that that the parabolically induced representations,
introduced in Section 4, are generated by finitely many K-finite vectors, with
local uniformity in the continuous induction parameter.

Proposition 5.1 Let Q ∈ Pσ and let ξ be a unitary representation of MQ of
finite length. Assume that Ω ⊂ a∗QqC is a bounded subset. Then there exists a
                  b such that, for all ν ∈ Ω,
finite subset ϑ ⊂ K

                    πQ,ξ,ν (U (g))C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ = C ∞ (K : ξ)K .               (5.1)

Remark 5.2 In particular, the result holds for σ = θ; then Q is an arbitrary
parabolic subgroup of G and aQq equals its usual Langlands split component
aQ .




                                         15
Proof: It suffices to prove the result for ξ irreducible. We shall do this by a
method given for ξ tempered in [28], § 5.5.5. Let

             ω: = {ν ∈ a∗QqC | hRe ν − ρQ , αi > 0, ∀ α ∈ ∆r (Q).}

Then for ν ∈ ω we may define the standard intertwining operator A(ν) =
A(Q̄ : Q : ξ : ν) from C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν) to C ∞ (Q̄ : ξ : ν), by
                                   Z
                      A(ν)f (x) =       f (n̄ x) dn̄,     (x ∈ G),
                                   N̄Q


where dn̄ denotes a choice of Haar measure on N̄Q . The integral is absolutely
convergent; this follows by an argument that involves estimates completely anal-
ogous to the ones given for Q minimal in [4], proof of Lemma 15.6. It also follows
from these estimates that, for f ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ), the function A(ν)f ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)
depends holomorphically on ν ∈ ω.

Lemma 5.3 Let f, g ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ), ν ∈ ω and X ∈ a+
                                                 Qq . Then


    lim et(−ν+ρQ )(X) hπQ,ξ,ν (m exp tX)f | gi = hξ(m)[A(ν)f ](e) | g(e)iξ .   (5.2)
    t→∞

Proof: See [29], Lemma 10.5.1.                                                    

Completion of the proof of Prop. 5.1: From (5.2) it can be deduced, by
an argument due to Langlands [24], Lemma 3.13, see also Milicic [25], Proof of
Thm. 1, that if f ∈ C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν)K and A(ν)f 6= 0, then f is a cyclic vector for
πξ,ν in the sense that the (g, K)-module generated by f equals C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν)K .
See also [29], Cor. 10.5.2. We can now prove the result in the case that the
closure of Ω is contained in ω. Indeed, assume this to be the case and let ν0 ∈ Ω.
Since f 7→ A(ν0 )f (e) can be expressed as a convolution operator with non-
trivial kernel, there exists a finite set ϑ ⊂ K b and a function f ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ
such that A(ν0 )f (e) 6= 0; by continuity in the parameter ν there exists an open
neighborhood ω0 of ν0 in ω such that A(ν)f (e) 6= 0 for all ν ∈ ω0 . From what
we said above, it follows that (5.1) holds for all ν ∈ ω0 . By compactness of the
set Ω, the result now readily follows in case Ω is contained in ω.
    We shall now use tensoring with a finite dimensional representation to extend
the result to an arbitrary bounded subset Ω ⊂ a∗QqC .
    Let P ∈ Pσmin be such that P ⊂ Q. Let ∆Q (P ): = {α ∈ ∆(P ) | α|aQq = 0}
and put ∆(Q) = ∆(P )\∆Q (P ). We fix n ∈ N such that hRe ν −ρQ , αi/hα , αi >
−8n for all ν ∈ Ω̄ and α ∈ ∆(Q). We fix µ ∈ a∗q with the property that
hµ , αi/hα , αi equals 8n for all α ∈ ∆(Q) and zero for all α ∈ ∆Q (P ). Then µ +
Ω ⊂ ω. Hence there exists a finite subset ϑ′ ⊂ K b such that πξ,ν+µ (U (g))C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ′ =
  ∞
C (K : ξ)K , for all ν ∈ Ω.
    It follows from the condition on µ that hµ , αi/2hα , αi ∈ 4Z for all α ∈ ∆(P ).
Since Σ is a possibly non-reduced root system, this implies that hµ , αi/2hα , αi ∈
2Z for all α ∈ Σ. According to [4], Cor. 5.7 and Prop. 5.5, there exists a class


                                         16
one finite dimensional irreducible G-module (F, π) of ∆(P )-highest aq -weight µ;
the highest weight space Fµ is one dimensional, and Mσ = MP σ acts trivially on
it. Since MQσ centralizes aQq , it normalizes Fµ . By compactness it follows that
(KQ )e acts trivially on Fµ . Since µ vanishes on ∗ aQq = aq ∩ mQ , it follows that
∗
  AQq also acts trivially on Fµ . Finally, since MQσ is generated by Mσ , (KQ )e
and ∗ AQq , it follows that MQσ acts by the identity on Fµ .
    Let eµ ∈ Fµ be a non-trivial highest weight vector. Then the map m: F ∗ →
C (G) defined by m(v)(x) = v(π(x−1 )eµ ) is readily seen to be an equivariant
  ∞

map from F ∗ into C ∞ (Q : 1 : −µ). The map Mν : C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν + µ) ⊗ F ∗ 7→
C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν) given by Mν (ϕ ⊗ v) = m(v)ϕ is G-equivariant, for every ν ∈ a∗QqC .
    Let vK ∈ F ∗ be a non-trivial K-fixed vector, then, since G = QK, the
function m(vK ) is nowhere vanishing. From this we see that Mν is surjec-
tive, for every ν ∈ a∗QqC . It follows that the U (g)-module generated by Vν : =
Mν (C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν + µ)ϑ′ ⊗ F ∗ ) equals C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν)K , for all ν ∈ Ω. Let ϑ ⊂ K b
                                                      ∗                 ′
be the collection of all K-types occurring in δ ⊗ F for some δ ∈ ϑ . Then ϑ is a
finite set and Vν ⊂ C ∞ (Q : ξ : ν)ϑ , for all ν ∈ a∗QqC . Hence, (5.1) follows for all
ν ∈ Ω.                                                                               


6     Differentiation of spherical functions
In this section we assume (τ, Vτ ) to be a finite dimensional unitary representation
of K. We shall investigate the action of LZ , for Z ∈ g, on the Eisenstein integral
E ◦ (Q : ν). Here L denotes the infinitesimal left regular representation. As a
preparation, we shall first investigate the action of LZ on functions from the
space C ∞ (X+ : τ ), defined in [12], § 6. Secondly, we shall investigate the action
                           hyp
of LZ on families from EQ      (X : τ ), defined in [12], Def. 6.6.
     Given a function F ∈ C (X+ : τ ), we define the function Fe: X+ → g∗C ⊗Vτ ≃
                             ∞

Hom(gC , Vτ ) by

                   Fe(x)(Z) = LZ F (x),        (x ∈ X+ , Z ∈ gC ).

One readily checks that

       Fe (kx)(Z) = τ (k)Fe(x)(Ad(k −1 )Z),        (x ∈ X+ , k ∈ K, Z ∈ gC ).

Hence, Fe is a spherical function of its own right. In fact, let Ad∨  K denote the
restriction to K of the coadjoint representation of G in g∗C and put τe: = Ad∨
                                                                             K ⊗ τ.
Then
                                Fe ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τe).
Our first objective is to show that if F has a certain converging expansion
towards infinity along (Q, v), for Q ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ), then Fe has a similar
expansion, which can be computed in terms of that of F. As a preparation, we
study sets consting of points of the form mav, where v ∈ NK (aq ), m ∈ MQσ
and a → ∞ in A+   Qq . They describe regions of convergence for the expansions



                                          17
involved, in the spirit of [11], § 3. We will also describe decompositions of
elements of g along such sets, in a fashion similar to [11], § 4. These will be
needed to compute the expansion of Fe .
   Let Q ∈ Pσ . We define the function RQ,v : M1Q → ] 0, ∞ [ as in [11], Section
3. Recall that RQ,v is left KQ - and right M1Q ∩ vHv −1 -invariant; thus, it may
be viewed as a function on X1Q,v . If Q = G, then RQ,v equals the constant
function 1 and if Q 6= G, then according to [11], Lemma 3.2, it is given by

                              RQ,v (au) = max a−α ,
                                           α∈Σ(Q)

for a ∈ Aq and u ∈ NKQ (aq ). The inclusion map MQ → M1Q induces an
embedding via which we may identify XQ,v with a sub MQ -manifold of X1Q,v .
From [11], Lemma 3.2, we recall that RQ,v ≥ 1 on XQ,v .
Lemma 6.1 Let v ∈ NK (aq ) and put Q′ = v −1 Qv. Then

                    RQ,v (m) = RQ′ ,1 (v −1 mv),      (m ∈ M1Q ).

Proof: This follows immediately from the characterization of RQ,v given above.

     In accordance with [11], Eqn. (3.7), we define, for v ∈ NK (aq ) and R > 0,

                     M1Q,v [R]: = {m ∈ M1Q | RQ,v (m) < R},

and MQσ,v [R]: = MQσ ∩ M1Q,v [R]. Note that M1Q,1 [R] and MQσ,1 [R] equal the
sets M1Q [R] and MQσ [R], defined in [11], text preceding Lemma 4.7, respec-
tively. Finally, for R > 0 we define

             A+
              Qq (R): = {a ∈ AQq | a
                                     −α
                                        <R         for all   α ∈ ∆r (Q)}.   (6.1)

Lemma 6.2 Let v ∈ NK (aq ) and put Q′ = v −1 Qv. Let R > 0.
 (a) M1Q,v [R] = vM1Q′ [R]v −1 ,     MQσ,v [R] = vMQ′ σ [R]v −1 .

                              .

Proof: Assertion (a) follows readily from combining Lemma 6.1 with the defi-
nitions of the sets involved. Assertion (b) is clear from (6.1).         
                                      ′
   We define the open dense subset M1Q    of M1Q as in [11], Eqn. (4.3). Write
g : = ker(−I ± θσ) and put gα : = gα ∩ g± , for α ∈ Σ. Write H1Q : = M1Q ∩ H.

Then by [11], Cor. 4.2,

              M1Q     = KQ [M1Q ∩ Aq ] H1Q ,

In particular, M1Q   is a left KQ - and right H1Q -invariant open dense subset of
                                   ′                                       ′

Lemma 6.3 Let v ∈ NK (aq ) and put Q′ = v −1 Qv. Then M1Q,v

Proof: This readily follows from the definition.                                  

Proof: For v = 1, the results are given in [11], Lemma 4.7. Let now v be
arbitrary and put Q′ = v −1 Qv. Using Lemma 6.2 (a) with R = 1 and Lemma
6.3 we obtain (a) from the similar statement with Q′ , 1 in place of Q, v. Likewise,
assertion (b) follows by application of Lemma 6.2.                                

     We now come to the investigation of decompositions in g, needed for the
study of the asymptotic behavior of Fe . Write k(Q): = k ∩ (nQ + n̄Q ). Then I +
θ: X 7→ X + θX is a linear isomorphism from n̄Q onto k(Q). For α ∈ Σ we put

Lemma 6.5 Let v ∈ NK (aq ). If m ∈ M1Q,v , then nQ ⊂ k(Q) ⊕ Ad(mv)h.

Proof: For v = 1 this follows from [11], Lemma 4.3 (b), with Q̄ in place of
Q. If v is arbitrary, put Q′ = v −1 Qv. Then for m ∈ M1Q,v
                                                      ′
                                                           we have v −1 mv ∈

   By the above lemma, for m ∈ M1Q,v we may define a linear map Φ(m) =
ΦQ,v (m) ∈ Hom(nQ , k(Q)) by

                    X ∈ Φ(m)X + Ad(mv)h,            (X ∈ nQ ).                (6.3)

It is readily seen that ΦQ,v is an analytic Hom(nQ , k(Q))-valued function on

Lemma 6.6 If m ∈ M1Q,v , k ∈ KQ and h ∈ M1Q ∩ vHv −1 , then

                       Φ(kmh) = Ad(k) ◦ Φ(m) ◦ Ad(k)−1 .

Proof: Since M1Q normalizes nQ and KQ normalizes k(Q) the result is an
immediate consequence of the definition in equation (6.3).           

Lemma 6.7 Let v ∈ NK (aq ) and put Q′ = v −1 Qv. Then, for all m ∈ M1Q,v
                                                                    ′

                  ΦQ,v (m) = Ad(v) ◦ ΦQ′ ,1 (v −1 mv) ◦ Ad(v)−1 ,

Proof: This follows from (6.3), by the same reasoning as in the proof of Lemma
6.5.                                                                         

    Let Ψ = ΨQ : M1Q → Hom(n̄Q , k(Q)) be defined as in [11], Eqn. (4.4). Then,

Lemma 6.8 Let m ∈ M1Q . Then

                       ΦQ,1 (m) = −Ψ(m) ◦ σ ◦ Ad(m−1 ).                     (6.5)
                          ′
Proof: If X ∈ nQ and m ∈ M1Q , then σAd(m−1 )X ∈ n̄Q , so that σAd(m−1 )X
belongs to Ad(m )Ψ(m)σAd(m )X +h. Since Ad(m−1 )X ∈ −σAd(m−1 )X +

h, this implies that

               Ad(m−1 )X ∈ −Ad(m−1 )Ψ(m)σAd(m−1 )X + h.

Comparing with the definition of ΦQ,1 (m) given in (6.3) with v = 1, we obtain
the desired identity.                                                       

   In the formulation of the next result we use the terminology of neat conver-
gence of exponential polynomial series, introduced in [11], § 1.

Proposition 6.9 Let v ∈ NK (aq ). There exist unique real analytic Hom(nQ , k(Q))-
valued functions Φµ = ΦQ,v,µ on MQσ , for µ ∈ N∆r (Q), such that, for every
m ∈ MQσ and all a ∈ A+Qq (RQ,v (m)

                                     ),

                       ΦQ,v (ma) =                a−µ Φµ (m),               (6.6)
                                      µ∈N∆r (Q)

with absolutely convergent series. Moreover, Φ0 = 0. Finally, for every R > 1
the series in (6.6) converges neatly on A+
                                         Qq (R
                                               −1
                                                  ) as a ∆r (Q)-power series with
                 ∞
coefficients in C (MQσ,v [R]) ⊗ Hom(nQ , k(Q)).

Proof: We first assume that v = 1. Let Ψµ : MQσ → End(n̄Q ) be as in [11],
Prop. 4.8. Then it follows from combining the mentioned proposition with (6.5)
that, for m ∈ MQσ and a ∈ A+  Qq (RQ,1 (m)
                                          −1
                                             ),
                                   X
           Φ(ma) = −(I + θ) ◦                a−µ Ψµ (m) ◦ σ ◦ Ad(ma)−1 ,
                                µ∈N∆r (Q)

with absolutely convergent series. We now see that the restriction of Φ(ma) to
gα , for α ∈ Σ(Q), equals
                            X
                −(I + θ) ◦         a−µ−α Ψµ (m) ◦ σ ◦ Ad(m)|gα .
                          µ∈N∆r (Q)

Put Φ0 = 0 and, for ν ∈ N∆r (Q) \ {0}, define Φν (m) ∈ Hom(nQ , k(Q)) by

                Φν (m)|gα : = −(I + θ) ◦ Ψν−α (m) ◦ σ ◦ Ad(m)|gα

                                        20
if ν − α ∈ N∆r (Q), and by Φν (m)|gα = 0 otherwise. Then (6.6) follows with
absolute convergence. All remaining assertions about convergence follow from
the analogous assertions in [11], Prop. 4.8.
    We now turn to the case that v is general. Let Q′ = v −1 Qv, and define
             ΦQ,v,µ (m) = Ad(v) ◦ ΦQ′ ,1,Ad(v)−1 µ (v −1 mv) ◦ Ad(v)−1 ,
for µ ∈ N∆r (Q) and m ∈ MQσ . Then all assertions follow from the similar
assertions with Q′ , 1 in place of Q, v, by application of Lemmas 6.7 and 6.2. 
   We now come to the behavior of LZ , for Z ∈ gC , at points of the form mav,
with v ∈ NK (aq ), m ∈ MQσ and a → ∞ in A+  Qq . We start by observing that

                         g = nQ ⊕ aQq ⊕ (mQσ ∩ p) ⊕ k,                         (6.7)
as a direct sum of linear spaces. Accordingly, we write, for Z ∈ gC ,
                            Z = Zn + Za + Zm + Zk ,                            (6.8)
with terms in the complexifications of the summands in (6.7), respectively. If l
is a real Lie algebra, then by U (l) we denote the universal enveloping algebra
of its complexification, and by Uk (l), for k ∈ N, the subspace of elements of
order at most k. For Z ∈ gC we define the element D0 (Z) = DQ,v,0 (Z) of
U1 (mQσ ) ⊗ U1 (aQq ) ⊗ End(Vτ ) by
              D0 (Z): = Zm ⊗ I ⊗ I + I ⊗ Za ⊗ I + I ⊗ I ⊗ τ (Žk ),            (6.9)
where X 7→ X̌ denotes the canonical anti-automorphism of U (g). If, more-
over, m ∈ MQσ , we define, for µ ∈ N∆r (Q) \ {0}, the element Dµ (Z, m) =
DQ,v,µ (Z, m) of U1 (mQσ ) ⊗ U1 (aQq ) ⊗ End(Vτ ) by
                      Dµ (Z, m): = I ⊗ I ⊗ τ (ΦQ,v,µ (m)Žn ).
Finally, if m ∈ MQσ and a ∈ A+   Qq (RQ,v (m)
                                             −1
                                                ), we define the element DQ,v (Z, a, m) ∈
U1 (mQσ ) ⊗ U1 (aQq ) ⊗ End(Vτ ) by
                                           X
                     DQ,v (Z, a, m) =            a−µ Dµ (Z, m),               (6.10)
                                      µ∈N∆r (Q)

where we have put D0 (Z, m) = D0 (Z). We also agree to write
                     +
                    DQ,v (Z, a, m): = DQ,v (Z, a, m) − D0 (Z).
It follows from Prop. 6.9 that, for each R > 1, the series (6.10) is neatly conver-
gent on A+Qq (R
                −1
                   ) as a ∆r (Q)-exponential series with values in C ∞ (MQσ,v [R])⊗
U1 (mQσ ) ⊗ U1 (aQq ) ⊗ End(Vτ ). Moreover,
                     +
                    DQ,v (Z, a, m) = I ⊗ I ⊗ τ (ΦQ,v (ma)Žn ).              (6.11)
In the formulation of the following result we use the notation of the paper [11],
Sections 1-3. Via the left regular representation, we view U (mQσ ) ⊗ U (aQq ) ⊗
End(Vτ ) as the algebra of right-invariant differential operators on M1Q ≃ MQσ ×
AQq , with coefficients in End(Vτ ).

Proposition 6.10 Let F ∈ C ep (X+ : τ ). Then Fe ∈ C ep (X+ : τe). Moreover,
if Q ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ), then Exp (Q, v | Fe ) ⊂ Exp (Q, v | F ) − N∆r (Q).
Finally, for every Z ∈ gC , the ∆r (Q)-exponential expansion
                                 X
                  Fe (mav)(Z) =      aξ qξ (Q, v | Fe , log a, m)(Z)    (6.12)
                                      ξ

along (Q, v) arises from the similar expansion
                                X
                      F (mav) =     aξ qξ (Q, v | F, log a, m)                        (6.13)
                                      ξ

by the formal application of the expansion (6.10). In particular, if ξ is a leading
exponent of F along (Q, v), then, for every Z ∈ gC ,

  qξ (Q, v | Fe, log( · ), · )(Z) = [DQ,v,0 (Z) − ξ(Za )] qξ (Q, v | F, log( · ), · ). (6.14)

Proof: It is obvious that Fe ∈ C ∞ (X+ : τ ). We shall investigate its expan-
sion along (Q, v), for Q ∈ Pσ and v ∈ NK (aq ). We start by observing that,
for R > 1, the expansion (6.13) converges neatly on A+     q (R
                                                                −1
                                                                   ) as a ∆r (Q)-
exponential polynomial expansion in the variable a, with coefficients in the
space C ∞ (XQ,v,+ [R] : τQ ), see [11], Thm. 3.4.
    If ϕ is a smooth function on a Lie group L, with values in a complete locally
convex space, then for X ∈ l and x ∈ L we put ϕ(X; x): = d/dt ϕ(exp tXx)|t=0 .
Accordingly, it follows from (6.8) that for Z ∈ gC , and m ∈ MQσ and a ∈ AQq
with mav ∈ X+ , we have

              F̃ (mav)(Z)     = F (Ž; mav)
                              = τ (Žk )F (mav) + F (Žm ; mav)
                                          +F (Ža ; mav) + F (Žn ; mav).             (6.15)

The sum of the first three terms allows an expansion that is obtained by the
termwise formal application of DQ,v,0 (Z) to the expansion (6.13), by [11], Lem-
mas 1.9 and 1.10. Moreover, the resulting expansion converges on A+    q (R
                                                                            −1
                                                                               ) as
a ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial expansion in the variable a, with coefficients
in the space C ∞ (XQ,v,+ [R], Vτ ). Thus, it remains to discuss the last term in
(6.15). Since F is right H-invariant and left τ -spherical, we see by application
of (6.3) and (6.11) that the mentioned term may be rewritten as

                    F (Žn ; mav) =       F (ΦQ,v (ma)Žn ; mav)
                                     =    τ (ΦQ,v (ma)Žn )F (mav)
                                           +
                                     =    DQ,v (Z, a, m)F ( · v)(ma).
                                                      +
It follows from Proposition 6.9 that the series for DQ,v (Z) converges neatly on
  +    −1
Aq (R ) as a ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial expansion in the variable a, with
coefficients in the space C ∞ (MQ,σ,v [R]) ⊗ End(Vτ ). From [11], Lemma 1.10, it

                                            22
now follows that F (Žn ; mav) admits a ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial expansion
                                                                      +
that is obtained by the obvious formal application of the series for DQ,v (Z, a, m)
                                                                      +
to the series for F (mav). The resulting series converges neatly on AQq (R−1 ) as
a ∆r (Q)-exponential polynomial expansion in the variable a with coefficients
in C ∞ (MQσ,v [R], Vτ ). It follows that F̃ (mav)(Z) has an expansion of the type
asserted along (Q, v), with exponents as indicated.
    In particular, if Q is minimal, it follows that F̃ (mav) allows a neatly con-
verging ∆(Q)-exponential polynomial expansion in the variable a ∈ A+         q (Q),
with coefficients in C ∞ (XQ,v ) ⊗ g∗C ⊗ Vτ . This implies that Fe belongs to the
space C ep (X+ : τ̃ ), defined in [11], Def. 2.1.
    It remains to prove the assertion about the leading exponent ξ for F along
(Q, v). From the above discussion we readily see that the term in the expansion
(6.12) with exponent ξ is obtained from the application of the constant term
DQ,v,0 (Z) of DQ,v (Z, a, m) to the term in the expansion (6.13) with exponent
ξ. This yields

    aξ qξ (Q, v | Fe, log a, m)(Z) = DQ,v,0 (Z)[(m, a) 7→ aξ qξ (Q, v | F, log a, m)].

Now use that a−ξ ◦ DQ,v,0 (Z) ◦ aξ = DQ,v,0 (Z) + ξ(Ža ) to obtain (6.14).              
   We can now describe the action of LZ , for Z ∈ gC , on families from the space
 hyp
EQ   (X : τ ), defined in [12], Def. 6.6.

Theorem 6.11 Let F ∈ EQ      hyp
                                 (X : τ ). Then the family Fe: a∗QqC × X → g∗C ⊗ Vτ ,
defined by (Fe )ν = (Fν ) belongs to EQ
                         ∼              hyp
                                            (X : τe). Moreover, for every Z ∈ gC and
                                    ∗
all ν in an open dense subset of aQqC ,

qν−ρQ (Q, v | Feν : log( · ) : · )(Z)
                = [DQ,v,0 (Z) − (ν − ρQ )(Za )] qν−ρQ (Q, v | Fν : log( · ) : · ). (6.16)

Proof: There exist δ ∈ DQ and a finite subset Y ⊂ ∗ a∗QqC such that F ∈
  hyp
EQ,Y  (X : τ : δ). Let H = HF , d = dF and k = dega F be defined as in the text
following [12], Def. 6.1. Then F satisfies all conditions of the mentioned defini-
tion. It follows from the characterization of the expansions for Fe in Proposition
6.10 that Fe satisfies the hypotheses of [12], Def. 6.1. with τe in place of τ, with
the same Y, H, d, k. In particular, Fe belongs to CQ,Y      ep,hyp
                                                                   (X+ : τe).
    Since Fν is annihilated by the ideal Iδ,ν for generic ν ∈ a∗QqC , the same holds
for Feν , and we see that Fe ∈ EQ,Y  hyp
                                         (X+ : τe : δ), see [12], Def. 6.3.
                               1
    Let now s ∈ W, P ∈ Pσ such that s(aQq ) 6⊂ aP q and v ∈ NK (aq ). Then there
exists an open dense subset Ω ⊂ a∗QqC such that F satisfies the condition stated
in [12], Def. 6.4. It follows from Propositon 6.10 and the fact that the functions
m 7→ DP,v,µ (Z, m) are smooth on all of MP σ , for Z ∈ gC , µ ∈ N∆r (P ), that F̃
also satisfies the condition of [12], Def. 6.4, with the same set Ω. We conclude
that Fe ∈ EQ,Yhyp
                  (X+ : τe : δ)glob . In view of [12], Lemma 6.8, ν 7→ Fν is a mero-
morphic C (X : τ )-valued function on a∗ . Hence, ν 7→ Feν is a meromorphic

    Finally, for ν in an open dense subset of a∗QqC , the element ν − ρQ is a leading
exponent for F along (Q, v). Thus, (6.16) follows from (6.14).                     
    Next, we apply the above result to the normalized Eisenstein integral E ◦ (Q : ψ : ν),
defined for ψ ∈ A2,Q . Let v ∈ Q W. Given a function ψv ∈ A2 (XQ,v : τQ ) and an
element ν ∈ a∗QqC we define the function
                             ∂Q,v (ν)ψv : XQ,v → g∗C ⊗ Vτ                       (6.17)
by
          ∂Q,v (ν)ψv (x)(Z) = [LZm − (ν − ρQ )(Za )]ψv (x) − τ (Zk )[ψv (x)],
for x ∈ XQ,v and Z ∈ gC . Clearly, the function ∂Q,v (ν)ψv is a D(XQ,v )-finite
Schwartz function with values in g∗C ⊗Vτ . Since KQ normalizes the decomposition
(6.7) and centralizes aQq , one readily checks that the function is τeQ -spherical,
with τeQ : = τe|KQ . Hence,
                              ∂Q,v (ν)ψv ∈ A2 (XQ,v : τeQ ).
                                                                                 Q
We define the map ∂Q (ν): A2,Q (τ ) → A2,Q (eτ ) as the direct sum, for v ∈          W,
of the maps ∂Q,v (ν): A2 (XQ,v : τQ ) → A2 (XQ,v : τeQ ).
Theorem 6.12 Let ψ ∈ A2,Q (τ ) and let the family F : a∗QqC ×X → Vτ be defined
by
                     F (ν, x) = Eτ◦ (Q : ψ : ν : x).
Then the family Fe: a∗QqC × X → g∗C ⊗ Vτ , defined by (Fe )ν = (Fν )∼ , is given by

                           Fe (ν, x) = Eτe◦ (Q : ∂Q (ν)ψ : ν : x).
Proof: It follows from [12], Def. 13.7 and Prop. 13.6, that the family F belongs
     hyp                                                                 hyp
to EQ    (X : τ ) and that the family G: = E ◦ (Q : ∂Q (ν)ψ) belongs to EQ   (X : τe).
          Q
Let v ∈ W. Then it follows from the mentioned proposition, combined with
[11], Thm. 7.7, Eqn. (7.14), that, for ν in an open dense subset of a∗QqC and all
X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ ,
                     qν−ρQ (Q, v | Fν , X, m) =        ψv (m),                  (6.18)
                     qν−ρQ (Q, v | Gν , X, m) =        ∂Q,v (ν)ψv (m).          (6.19)

From Theorem 6.11 we see that Fe ∈ EQ     hyp
                                              (X : τe). Moreover, combining (6.18)
and (6.16) we infer that, for Z ∈ gC , ν in an open dense subset of a∗QqC and all
X ∈ aQq and m ∈ XQ,v,+ ,

     qν−ρQ (Q, v | Feν , X, m)(Z) = [DQ,v,0 (Z) − (ν − ρQ )(Za )][(m, a) 7→ ψv (m)].
From (6.9) we see that the expression on the right-hand side of this equation
equals [∂Q,v (ν)ψv (m)](Z); hence

                       qν−ρQ (Q, v | Feν , X, m) = ∂Q,v (ν)ψv (m).              (6.20)

                                             24
Comparing (6.20) with (6.19) we deduce that the family Fe − G ∈ EQ   hyp
                                                                         (X : τe)
satisfies the hypothesis of the vanishing theorem, [12], Thm. 6.10. Hence, Fe =
G.                                                                             

     Given ν ∈ a∗QqC and ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ) we define the function

                         d(Q, ξ, ν) ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ) ⊗ g∗C ⊗ Vτ

by
                    [d(Q, ξ, ν) ϕ](k, Z) = ([πξ,−ν (Z) ⊗ I] ϕ)(k),           (6.21)
                                                                     ∞
for k ∈ K and Z ∈ gC . One readily verifies that d(Q, ξ, ν)ϕ ∈ C (K : ξ : τe).

Lemma 6.13 Let T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ). Then, for all ν ∈ a∗QqC ,

                                ψ[I⊗d(Q,ξ,ν)]T = ∂Q (ν)ψT .

Proof: By linearity it suffices to prove this for T = η ⊗ ϕ, with η ∈ V̄ (ξ) and
ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ). Let v ∈ Q W and Z ∈ gC . Then combining (6.21) with the
decomposition (6.8) we infer that

     [d(Q, ξ, ν)ϕ](e)(Z) = [ξ(Zm ) ⊗ I − I ⊗ τ (Zk )]ϕ(e) − (ν − ρQ )(Za )ϕ(e).

By equivariance, ηv maps Hξ∞ into L2 (XQ,v )∞       ∞
                                             ξ ⊂ C (XQ,v ), intertwining the
(mQ , KQ )-actions. Using formula (4.8) we now obtain that

ψ[I⊗d(Q,ξ,ν)]T,v ( · )(Z) =
  = [ηv ⊗ I]([ξ(Zm ) ⊗ I]ϕ(e)) − [(ν − ρQ )(Za )I ⊗ I + I ⊗ τ (Zk )](ηv ⊗ I)(ϕ(e))
  = [LZm − (ν − ρQ )(Za )](ψT,v )( · ) − τ (Zk )[ψT,v ( · )]
  = (∂(Q, ν)ψT )v ( · )(Z).

                                                                                  

Corollary 6.14 Let T ∈ V̄ (ξ)⊗C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ) and let the family F : a∗QqC ×X →
Vτ be defined by
                           Fν = E ◦ (Q : ψT : ν).
Then the family Fe: ν 7→ (Fν )∼ is given by

                              Feν = E ◦ (Q : ψ[I⊗d(Q,ξ,ν)]T : ν).            (6.22)

Proof: This follows from Theorem 6.12 and Lemma 6.13.                             
   As a consequence of the above, we can now express derivatives of the nor-
malized Eisenstein integral in a form needed for the proof of Theorem 4.6.




                                              25
Proposition 6.15 Let ϑ ⊂ K      b be a finite subset, and let ϑ′ ⊂ Kb be the union
of the collections of K-types occurring in AdK ⊗ δ, as δ ∈ ϑ. Let T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗
C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ . Then (I ⊗ πξ,−ν (Z))T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ′ , for all Z ∈ gC and
ν ∈ a∗QqC . Moreover, for all Z ∈ gC , x ∈ X and k ∈ K,

   LAd(k)−1 Z Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : ν)(x)(k) = Eϑ◦′ (Q : ψ[I⊗πξ,−ν (Z)]T : ν)(x)(k),        (6.23)

as a meromorphic identity in ν ∈ a∗QqC .

Proof: Let τ = τϑ . We shall use the natural identification C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ ≃
C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ) of Lemma 3.4, so that ψT may be viewed as an element of V̄ (ξ) ⊗
C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ).
   Define the family F as in Corollary 6.14. We shall derive the identity (6.23)
from (6.22) by using the functorial properties of Lemma 4.5.
   Fix Z ∈ gC . We define the matrix coefficient map mZ : g∗C → C ∞ (K) by

                  mZ (ζ)(k) = ζ(Ad(k −1 )Z),          (ζ ∈ g∗C , k ∈ K).

The map mZ intertwines the representation Ad∨                ∗
                                                K of K in gC with the right
regular representation of K in C(K). In particular, it maps into the finite di-
mensional space C(K)ϑ∨0 , with ϑ0 ⊂ Kb the set of K-types in AdK . We define
the equivariant map

                     S1 : = mZ ⊗ I: g∗C ⊗ Vϑ → C(K)ϑ∨0 ⊗ Vϑ .

On the other hand, we define the map S2 : C(K)ϑ∨0 ⊗Vϑ → C(K) by φ⊗ψ 7→ φψ.
This map intertwines τϑ0 ⊗τϑ with the right regular representation of K in C(K),
hence maps into C(K)ϑ′ ∨ . The space C(K)ϑ∨0 ⊗ Vϑ may be naturally identified
with a finite dimensional K-submodule of C(K × K), the latter being equipped
with the diagonal K-action from the right. Under this identification the map
S2 corresponds with the restriction of the map ∆∗ : C(K × K) → C(K) given
by ∆∗ ϕ(k) = ϕ(k, k).
    The map S = S2 ◦ S1 : g∗C ⊗ Vτ → Vϑ′ is K-equivariant. We shall apply I ⊗ S
to both sides of the identity (6.22). Application of I ⊗ S1 to the left-hand side
yields (I ⊗S1 )[Feν ( · )](k) = Feν ( · , Ad(k −1 )Z), which in turn equals LAd(k−1 )Z Fν .
By application of I ⊗ S2 to the latter function we find

             (I ⊗ S)[Feν ( · )](k)   = LAd(k−1 )Z Fν ( · )(k)
                                     = LAd(k−1 )Z E ◦ (Q : ψT : ν)( · )(k).         (6.24)

On the other hand, from Lemma 4.5 we see that application of I ⊗ S to the
expressions on both sides of (6.22) yields

                   (I ⊗ S)Feν = E ◦ (Q : ψ[I⊗I⊗S][I⊗d(Q,ξ,ν)]T : ν).                (6.25)

We observe that (I ⊗ S) ◦ d(Q, ξ, ν) is a linear map from C ∞ (K : ξ : τϑ ) to
C ∞ (K : ξ : τϑ′ ) and claim that the following diagram commutes, for every ν ∈


                                            26
a∗QqC ,
                                    (I⊗S) ◦ d(Q,ξ,ν)
              C ∞ (K : ξ : τϑ )   −−−−−−−−−−−−−→ C ∞ (K : ξ : τϑ′ )
                    ↓                                   ↓                      (6.26)
                 ∞                     πξ,−ν (Z)             ∞
                C (K : ξ)ϑ        −−−−−−−−−−−−−→          C (K : ξ)ϑ′
Here the vertical arrows represent the natural isomorphisms of Lemma 3.4. We
denote both of these isomorphisms by ϕ 7→ ϕ′ . It suffices to prove the claim,
since its validity implies that πξ,−ν (Z) maps C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ into C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ′ and
that the expression on the right-hand side of (6.25) equals the one on the right-
hand side of (6.23). Combining this with (6.24) we obtain (6.23).
    To see that the claim holds, let ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ : τϑ ) = (C ∞ (K : ξ) ⊗ Vϑ )K .
The associated element ϕ′ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ is given by
                           ϕ′ (k) = ϕ(k)(e),         (k ∈ K).
The element (I ⊗ S1 )d(Q, ξ, ν)ϕ of [C ∞ (K : ξ) ⊗ C(K)ϑ∨0 ⊗ Vϑ ]K is given by
          [(I ⊗ S1 )d(Q, ξ, ν)ϕ](k)(k1 ) =     [d(Q, ξ, ν)ϕ(k)](Ad(k1−1 )Z)
                                         =     [I ⊗ πξ,−ν (Ad(k1−1 )Z)]ϕ(k);
see (6.21). Hence, the element (I ⊗ S)d(Q, ξ, ν)ϕ ∈ [C ∞ (K : ξ) ⊗ Vϑ′ ]K is given
by
          (I ⊗ S)d(Q, ξ, ν)ϕ(k)(k1 ) = (I ⊗ πξ,−ν (Ad(k1−1 )Z))ϕ(k)(k1 ).
The natural isomorphism from [C ∞ (K : ξ)⊗Vϑ′ ]K onto C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ′ is induced
by the map I ⊗δe , where δe : Vϑ′ → C denotes evaluation at e (see (3.6)). Hence,
      ((I ⊗ S)d(Q, ξ, ν)ϕ)′ (k) = [(I ⊗ πξ,−ν (Z))ϕ](k)(e) = [πξ,−ν (Z)ϕ′ ](k).
This establishes the claim.                                                        
    We shall apply the above result in combination with Proposition 5.1 to
obtain the assertion of Theorem 4.6 about finiteness. If H ⊂ a∗QqC is a Σr (Q)-
hyperplane, we denote by αH the shortest root of Σr (Q) such that H is a
translate of (α⊥
               H )C . Thus, hαH , · i equals a constant c on H; we denote by lH
the linear polynomial function hαH , · i − c. In accordance with [12], Eqn. (4.3),
given a locally finite collection H of Σr (Q)-hyperplanes in a∗QqC and a map
d: H → N, we define, for every bounded subset ω of a∗QqC , the polynomial πω,d
by                                         Y d(H)
                              πω,d (ν) =        lH                         (6.27)

Proposition 6.16 Let Q ∈ Pσ , ξ ∈ X∧      Q,∗,ds . Then H(Q, ξ) is a locally finite
collection of real Σr (Q)-hyperplanes. Moreover, there exists a map d: H(Q, ξ) →
N such that, for every finite dimensional unitary representation τ of K, ev-
ery T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ : τ ) and every bounded open subset ω ⊂ a∗QqC , the
C ∞ (X : τ )-valued function
                             ν 7→ πω,d (ν)E ◦ (Q : ψT : ν)                     (6.28)
is holomorphic on ω. Here πω,d is defined by (6.27) with H = H(Q, ξ).

                                          27
Proof: Select any bounded open subset ω ⊂ a∗QqC . Let ϑ ⊂ K                b be a fi-
nite set associated with Q, ξ, −ω as in Proposition 5.1. According to [12],
Prop. 13.14, there exists a map d: H(Q, ξ, ϑ) → N with the property that,
for every T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ , the map ν 7→ Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : ν) belongs to
M(a∗Qq , H(Q, ξ, ϑ), d, C ∞ (X : τϑ )). See [12], § 4, for the definition of the latter
space.
    Let ϑ′ ⊂ Kb be an arbitrary finite subset. Fix ν0 ∈ ω. Then by Proposition
5.1 there exists k ∈ N such that the map
           Mν : Uk (g) ⊗ C(K : ξ)ϑ → C(K : ξ)K , u ⊗ ϕ 7→ πξ,−ν (u)ϕ

has image containing C(K : ξ)ϑ′ for ν = ν0 . On the other hand, let ϑ′′ ⊂ K          b
be the finite collection of K-types occurring in δ1 ⊗ δ2 , with δ1 ∈ K    b a K-type
occurring in the adjoint representation of K in Uk (g) and with δ2 ∈ ϑ. Then the
image of Mν is contained in C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ′′ for all ν ∈ a∗QqC . Let Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ denote the
K-equivariant projection from C(K : ξ)ϑ′′ onto C(K : ξ)ϑ′ . Then Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ ◦ Mν0
is surjective. Hence there exists a finite dimensional subspace E ⊂ Uk (g) ⊗
C(K : ξ)ϑ such that Rν : = Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ ◦ Mν |E : E → C(K : ξ)ϑ′ is a bijection for ν =
ν0 . By continuity and finite dimensionality, there exists an open neighborhood
ω0 of ν0 in ω such that Rν is a bijection for all ν ∈ ω0 . By Cramer’s rule, the
inverse Sν : = Rν−1 ∈ Hom(C(K : ξ)ϑ′ , E) depends holomorphically on ν ∈ ω0 .
Let (ui | 1 ≤ i ≤ I) be a basis of Uk (g) and (ϕj | 1 ≤ j ≤ J) a basis of
C(K : ξ)ϑ . Then there exist holomorphic [C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ′ ]∗ -valued functions sij on
ω0 , for 1 ≤ i ≤ I, 1 ≤ j ≤ J, such that
                            X
                   Sν (ϕ) =       sij (ν, ϕ)ui ⊗ ϕj ,   (ν ∈ ω0 ),
                                 1≤i≤I
                                 1≤j≤J


for ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ′ . Let ϕ ∈ C(K : ξ)ϑ′ . Then ϕ = Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ ◦ Mν ◦ Sν (ϕ), hence
                             X
                        ϕ=      sij (ν, ϕ) Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ πξ,−ν (ui )ϕj .
                                  i,j

Let η ∈ V̄ (ξ). Then it follows from the above by application of (4.17) and (4.18)
that
                                  X
πω,d (ν)Eϑ◦′ (Q : ψη⊗ϕ : ν) =       sij (ν, ϕ)πω,d (ν)Eϑ◦′ (Q : ψη⊗Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ πξ,−ν (ui )ϕj : ν)
                                         i,j
                                        X
                                 =             sij (ν, ϕ)(I ⊗ Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ )[πω,d (ν)Eϑ◦′′ (Q : ψη⊗πξ,−ν (ui )ϕj : ν)].
                                         i,j

Applying I ⊗ δe = ςϑ−1
                     ′ and using Lemma 3.6 and Proposition 6.15 we infer that
       πω,d (ν)Eϑ◦′ (Q : ψη⊗ϕ : ν : · )(e)
              X
         =        sij (ν, ϕ)Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ [πω,d (ν)Eϑ◦′′ (Q : ψη⊗πξ,−ν (ui )ϕj : ν : · )(e)]
                i,j
               X
          =           sij (ν, ϕ)Pϑ′ ,ϑ′′ Lui [πω,d (ν)Eϑ◦ (Q : ψη⊗ϕj : ν : · )(e)]            (6.29)
                i,j


                                                   28
From this we conclude that the expression on the left-hand side of the above
equation depends holomorphically on ν ∈ ω0 , as a function with values in
C ∞ (X). Since ν0 was arbitrary, it follows that the expression on the left-hand
side of (6.29) in fact depends holomorphically on ν ∈ ω. Hence, every H ∈
H(Q, ξ, ϑ′ ) with H ∩ ω 6= ∅ must be contained in H(Q, ξ, ϑ). This shows that
the collection H(Q, ξ) is locally finite. The argument also shows that there ex-
ists a map d: H(Q, ξ) → N such that the assertion of the proposition holds for
every τ of the form τ = τϑ′ , with ϑ′ ⊂ K b a finite subset. The general result now
follows by application of the functorial property of Lemma 4.5.                   

Corollary 6.17 Let d: H(Q, ξ) → N be as in Proposition 6.16. Then, for every
T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)K and every bounded open subset ω ⊂ a∗QqC , the function

                               ν 7→ πω,d (ν)JQ,ξ,ν (T )

extends to a holomorphic C ∞ (X)-valued function on ω.

Proof: This follows from Proposition 6.16 and the definition of JQ,ξ,ν , see
(4.20).                                                                   
   We can now finally give the promised proof.
Proof of Theorem 4.6: The properties of H(Q, ξ) have been established
in Proposition 6.16 and (4.19). Let ν ∈ a∗QqC . That JQ,ξ,ν is a g-equivariant
map follows from formula (4.20) combined with formula (6.23) with k = e. It
remains to establish the K-equivariance of JQ,ξ,ν . Let ϑ ⊂ K   b be a finite subset
                                 ∞
and let T = η ⊗ ϕ ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C (K : ξ)ϑ . We denote the natural isomorphism
C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ → C ∞ (K : ξ : τϑ ) of Lemma 3.4 by ς = ςϑ . Let k1 ∈ K. Then
one readily checks that ς ◦ πξ,−ν (k1 ) = (I ⊗ S) ◦ ς, with S the endomorphism of
Vϑ = C(K)ϑ∨ given by restriction of the left translation Lk1 . In particular, S
intertwines τϑ = R|Vϑ with itself. By the identification discussed in the text
before (4.13) we have

                      ψ[I⊗πξ,−ν (k1 )]T   = ψ[I⊗ςπξ,−ν (k1 )]T
                                          = ψ(I⊗I⊗S)(I⊗ς)T .

By Lemma 4.5 (a), combined with the identification mentioned above, the latter
expression equals
                       (I ⊗ S)ψ(I⊗ς)T = (I ⊗ S)ψT .
Applying Lemma 4.5 (b) we now find that

         JQ,ξ,ν ([I ⊗ πξ,−ν (k1 )]T ) =   Eϑ◦ (Q : ψ[I⊗πξ,−ν (k1 )]T : ν)( · )(e)
                                      =   [[I ⊗ S]Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : ν)( · )](e)
                                      =   Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : ν)( · )(k1−1 )
                                      =   Lk1 JQ,ξ,ν (T ).

                                                                                    

7    The Fourier transform
Let Q ∈ Pσ and ξ ∈ X∧  Q,∗,ds . We will use the map JQ,ξ , introduced in (4.20), to
define a (g, K)-equivariant Fourier transform for functions from Cc∞ (X)K .
    We define the collection H∨ (Q, ξ) of hyperplanes in a∗QqC by

                          H∨ (Q, ξ): = {−H | H ∈ H(Q, ξ)}.

Since H(Q, ξ) is a locally finite collection of real Σr (Q)-hyperplanes, see Theo-
rem 4.6, the same holds for H∨ (Q, ξ). It also follows from the mentioned theorem
that ∪H∨ (Q, ξ) is disjoint from ia∗Qq .
    Since H(Q, ξ) consists of real Σr (Q)-hyperplanes, every hyperplane of H(Q, ξ)
is invariant under the complex conjugation λ 7→ λ̄ in a∗QqC , defined with respect
to the real form a∗Qq . Hence, H∨ (Q, ξ) = {−H̄ | H ∈ H(Q, ξ)}. This justifies
the following definition.

Definition 7.1 Let f ∈ Cc∞ (X)K . For ν ∈ a∗QqC \∪H∨ (Q, ξ), the Fourier trans-
form fˆ(Q : ξ : ν) is defined to be the element of V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)K determined
by                                         Z
                    hfˆ(Q : ξ : ν) | T i =   f (x)JQ,ξ,−ν̄ (T )(x) dx,         (7.1)
                                         X
                      ∞
for all T ∈ V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C (K : ξ)K .

Lemma 7.2 Let ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H∨ (Q, ξ). Then the map f 7→ fˆ(Q : ξ : ν) from
Cc∞ (X)K to V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)K intertwines the (g, K)-module structure on
C ∞ (X)K coming from the left regular representation with the (g, K)-module
structure on V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)K coming from 1 ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν .

Proof: The spaces Cc∞ (X)K and V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ) are equipped with the
natural L2 -type inner products. The first of these inner products is equivariant
for the (g, K)-module structure coming from the left regular representation.
The second induces a sesquilinear pairing of V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ) with itself that
is equivariant for the (g, K)-module structures coming from 1 ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν and
1 ⊗ πQ,ξ,ν̄ , respectively. On the other hand, it follows from (7.1) that the map
f 7→ fˆ(Q, ξ, ν) is adjoint to the map JQ,ξ,−ν̄ , with respect to the given inner
products. Therefore, the (g, K)-intertwining property of f 7→ fˆ(Q, ξ, ν) follows
by transposition from the similar property for JQ,ξ,−ν , asserted in Theorem 4.6.

   If d: H(Q, ξ) → N is a map, we define the map d∨ : H∨ (Q, ξ) → N by d∨ (H) =
d(−H), for H ∈ H∨ (Q, ξ).

Lemma 7.3 Let d, d∨ be as above and let ω ⊂ a∗QqC be a bounded subset. Then

                   π−ω̄,d (−ν̄) = (−1)N πω,d∨ (ν),    (ν ∈ a∗QqC ),           (7.2)
           P
with N =     H   d(H), for H ∈ H(Q, v), H ∩ ω 6= ∅.

                                          30
Proof: In the notation of the text preceding (6.27), we have, for H ∈ H∨ (Q, ξ),

          lH (−ν̄) = −hαH , −νi − cH = hα−H , νi + c−H = −l−H (ν).                (7.3)

Moreover, since H is real, −ω̄ ∩ H 6= ∅ is equivalent to ω ∩ (−H) 6= ∅. In
view of the definition in (6.27), the identity (7.2) follows from (7.3) raised to
the power d∨ (H) = d(−H), by taking the product over all H ∈ H∨ (Q, ξ) with
ω ∩ (−H) 6= ∅.                                                                 



Lemma 7.4 Let d: H(Q, ξ) → N be as in Proposition 6.16 and define d∨ : H∨ (Q, ξ) →
N by d∨ (H) = d(−H). Then, for every bounded open subset ω ⊂ a∗QqC , every
                  b and every f ∈ C ∞ (X)ϑ , the function
finite subset ϑ ⊂ K

                               ν 7→ πω,d∨ (ν)fˆ(Q, ξ, ν),                         (7.4)

originally defined on ω\∪H∨ (Q, ξ), extends to a holomorphic V̄ (ξ)⊗C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ -
valued function on ω.

Proof: Let f be fixed as above. It follows from Lemma 7.2 that the function
(7.4) has values in the finite dimensional space V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ . Hence, it
suffices to establish the holomorphic continuation of the function that results
from (7.4) by taking the inner product with a fixed element T from V̄ (ξ) ⊗
C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ . In view of (7.1) the resulting function equals

           ν 7→ πω,d∨ (ν)hf | JQ,ξ,−ν̄ (T )i = hf | π−ω̄,d (−ν̄)JQ,ξ,−ν̄ (T )i,

see Lemma 7.3. We may now apply Corollary 6.17, with −ω̄ in place of ω, to
finish the proof.                                                       

   The following result gives the connection between the present Fourier trans-
form and the spherical Fourier transform, defined in [12], § 19.

Lemma 7.5 Let ϑ ⊂ K      b be a finite subset, let f ∈ C ∞ (X)ϑ and let F = ςϑ (f ) ∈
  ∞
C (X : τϑ ) be the corresponding spherical function, see Lemma 3.4. Let FQ F be
the τϑ -spherical Fourier transform of F. Then, for every T ∈ V̄ (ξ)⊗C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ ,

        hfˆ(Q : ξ : ν) | T i = hFQ F (ν) | ψT i,     (ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H∨ (Q, ξ)).

Proof: It follows from (7.1) and (4.20) that
                                    Z
              ˆ
            hfϑ (Q : ξ : ν) | T i =   f (x)Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : −ν̄)(x)(e) dx.
                                      X

One may now proceed as in [7], p. 539, proof of Prop. 3, displayed equations,
but in reversed order.                                                     

8     A direct integral
In this section we assume that Q ∈ Pσ and ξ ∈ X∧         Q,∗,ds are fixed. We will
define and study a direct integral representation πQ,ξ that will later appear as
a summand in the Plancherel decomposition.
    We equip
                          H(Q, ξ): = V̄ (ξ) ⊗ L2 (K : ξ)                     (8.1)
with the tensor product Hilbert structure and the natural structure of K-
module. Moreover, we define

                  L2 (Q, ξ): = L2 (ia∗Qq , H(Q, ξ), [W : WQ∗ ] dµQ ),

the space of square integrable functions ia∗Qq → H(Q, ξ), equipped with the
natural L2 -Hilbert structure associated with the indicated measure. Recall that
dµQ is Lebesgue measure on ia∗Qq , normalized as in [12], end of § 5.
   By unitarity of the representations πQ,ξ,ν , for ν ∈ ia∗Qq , the prescription

       (πQ,ξ (x)ϕ)(ν): = [I ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν (x)]ϕ(ν),        (ϕ ∈ L2 (Q, ξ), x ∈ G),

defines a homomorphism πQ,ξ from G into the group U(L2 (Q, ξ)) of unitary
transformations of L2 (Q, ξ).
Lemma 8.1 The homomorphism πQ,ξ : G → U(L2 (Q, ξ)) is a unitary repre-
sentation of G in L2 (Q, ξ).

Remark 8.2 It follows from the result above that πQ,ξ provides a realization
of the following direct integral
                          Z ⊕
                  πQ,ξ ≃       IV̄ (ξ) ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν [W : WQ∗ ] dµQ (ν).
                           ia∗
                             Qq


    For the proof of Lemma 8.1 it is convenient to define a dense subspace of
L2 (Q, ξ) by
                   L20 (Q, ξ): = Cc (ia∗Qq , V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)).     (8.2)
This space is equipped with a locally convex topology in the usual way. Thus, if
A ⊂ ia∗Qq is compact, let L20A (Q, ξ) denote the space CA (ia∗Qq , V̄ (ξ)⊗C ∞ (K : ξ))
of continuous functions from (8.2) with support contained in A. This space is
equipped with the Fréchet topology determined by the seminorms

                                  ϕ 7→ sup s(ϕ(ν)),
                                       ν∈A

where s ranges over the continuous seminorms on V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ). Moreover,

                             L20 (Q, ξ) = ∪A L20A (Q, ξ)

is equipped with the direct limit locally convex topology. Thus topologized,
L20 (Q, ξ) is a complete locally convex space.

                                          32
Lemma 8.3
 (a) The space L20 (Q, ξ) is G-invariant.
 (b) The restriction of πQ,ξ to L20 (Q, ξ) is a smooth representation of G. More-
     over, if ϕ ∈ L20 (Q, ξ) and u ∈ U (g), then πQ,ξ (u)ϕ is given by

                         [πQ,ξ (u)ϕ](ν) = [I ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν (u)] ϕ(ν).                 (8.3)

Proof: Let A ⊂ ia∗Qq be compact. Then it is a straightforward consequence of
the definition that the space L20A (Q, ξ) is G-invariant. In particular, this implies
(a).
    For (b) it suffices to prove that the restriction of πQ,ξ to L20A (Q, ξ) is smooth
and that (8.3) holds for ϕ ∈ L20A (Q, ξ).
    Let ϕ ∈ L20A (Q, ξ). We consider the function Φ: A × G × K → V̄ (ξ) ⊗ Hξ∞
defined by

        Φ(ν, x, k): = [I ⊗ evk ]([πQ,ξ (x)ϕ](ν)) = [I ⊗ evk πQ,ξ,−ν (x)]ϕ(ν),

where evk denotes the map C ∞ (K : ξ) → Hξ∞ induced by evaluation in k. We
recall that the multiplication map NQ × AQ × exp(mQ ∩ p) × K → G is a
diffeomorphism. Accordingly, we write

                   x = nQ (x)aQ (x)mQ (x)kQ (x),          (x ∈ G),                (8.4)

where νQ , aQ , mQ and kQ are smooth maps from G into NQ , AQ , exp(mQ ∩ p)
and KQ , respectively. Applying (8.4) with kx in place of x, we find that

               Φ(ν, x, k) = aQ (kx)−ν+ρQ ξ(mQ (kx))ϕ(ν, kQ (kx)).

From this expression we see that the function Φ is continuous, and smooth in
the variables (x, k). Moreover, for every C ∞ differential operator D on G × K,
the V̄ (ξ) ⊗ Hξ∞ -valued function

                             (ν, x, k) 7→ D[Φ(ν)](x, k)

is continuous. This implies that the CA (ia∗Qq , V̄ (ξ)⊗C ∞ (K : ξ))-valued function
x 7→ Φ(·, x, ·) is smooth on G; hence ϕ is a smooth vector for πQ,ξ . Let D be
any C ∞ differential operator on G and let ν ∈ A. Then evaluation in ν induces
a continuous linear operator L20A → V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ). Hence, for all x ∈ G,

      D[πQ,ξ ( · )ϕ](x)(ν) = D[evν (πQ,ξ ( · )ϕ)](x) = D(πQ,ξ,−ν ( · )ϕ(ν))(x).

Applying this with D = Ru and x = e we obtain (8.3).                                 

Proof of Lemma 8.1: Put π: = πQ,ξ . It suffices to show that the map G ×
L2 (Q, ξ) → L2 (Q, ξ), (x, ϕ) 7→ π(x)ϕ is continuous. Since π is a homomorphism
from the group G into U(L2 (Q, ξ)), it suffices to show that for any fixed ϕ ∈
L2 (Q, ξ) we have
                           lim π(x)ϕ = ϕ in L2 (Q, ξ).                     (8.5)
                          x→e


                                         33
Moreover, again because π maps into U(L2 (Q, ξ)), it suffices to prove (8.5)
for ϕ in a dense subspace of L2 (Q, ξ). Let ϕ ∈ L20 (Q, ξ). Then π(x)ϕ → ϕ
in L20 (Q, ξ), as x → e, by Lemma 8.3. By continuity of the inclusion map
L20 (Q, ξ) ֒→ L2 (Q, ξ), this implies (8.5).                              
   We end this section by establishing some other useful properties of the in-
                                    b then one readily verifies that
variant subspace L20 (Q, ξ). If ϑ ⊂ K,

                  L20 (Q, ξ)ϑ = Cc (ia∗Qq , V̄ (ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ ).       (8.6)

The space of K-finite vectors in L20 (Q, ξ) equals the union of the spaces (8.6)
                                                     b The natural U (g)-module
as ϑ ranges over the collection of finite subsets of K.
              2
structure of L0 (Q, ξ)K is given by formula (8.3).

Lemma 8.4 Let (ρ, W ) be a continuous representation of G in a complete
locally convex space, and let U be a dense G-invariant subspace of W. If U is
contained in W ∞ then it is dense in W ∞ for the C ∞ -topology.

Remark 8.5 For W a Banach space, this result is Thm. 1.3 of [27]. The
following proof is an adaptation of the proof given in the mentioned paper.

Proof: Replacing U by its closure in W ∞ if necessary, we may as well assume
that U is closed in W ∞ . Fix a choice dg of Haar measure on G. If ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (G),
then the map                         Z
                             ρ(ϕ): =        ϕ(g)ρ(g) dg
                                        G
                                       ∞
is continuous linear from W to W , as can be seen from a straightforward
estimation. Moreover, since U is closed in W ∞ , the map ρ(ϕ) maps U into
itself. Let W1 be the collection of vectors in W ∞ of the form ρ(ϕ)w0 , with
ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (G) and w0 ∈ W ∞ . Then W1 is dense in W ∞ . Hence, it suffices to show
that W1 is contained in U. Select w1 ∈ W1 and let N1 be an open neighborhood
of 0 in W ∞ . Then it suffices to show that U ∩ (w1 + N1 ) 6= ∅.
    Write w1 = ρ(ϕ)w0 , with w0 ∈ W ∞ and ϕ ∈ Cc∞ (G). By the mentioned
continuity of ρ(ϕ), there exists an open neighborhood N0 of 0 in W such that
ρ(ϕ)N0 ⊂ N1 . By density of U in W , the intersection U ∩(w0 +N0 ) is non-empty.
Hence,

                          ∅ (      ρ(ϕ)[U ∩ (w0 + N0 )]
                              ⊂    U ∩ ρ(ϕ)(w0 + N0 )
                              ⊂    U ∩ (w1 + N1 ).

                                                                              

Lemma 8.6 The space L20 (Q, ξ)K is dense in L2 (Q, ξ)∞ with respect to the
natural Fréchet topology of the latter space.



                                         34
Proof: The inclusion map j: L20 (Q, ξ) → L2 (Q, ξ) is continuous, intertwines the
G-actions and has dense image. From Lemma 8.3 it follows that L20 (Q, ξ)∞ =
L20 (Q, ξ). By equivariance of j it follows that L20 (Q, ξ) is contained in L2 (Q, ξ)∞ .
By application of Lemma 8.4 we see that L20 (Q, ξ) is dense in L2 (Q, ξ)∞ . The
conclusion now follows since L20 (Q, ξ)K is dense in L20 (Q, ξ).                     


9     Decomposition of the regular representation
Up till now, for Q ∈ Pσ , the expression ξ ∈ X∧   Q,∗,ds meant, by abuse of language,
that ξ is an irreducible unitary representation of MQ with equivalence class [ξ]
contained in X∧ Q,∗,ds . From now on it will be convenient to distinguish between
representations and their classes. For every Q ∈ Pσ and all ω ∈ X∧           Q,∗,ds we
select an irreducible unitary representation ξ = ξω in a Hilbert space Hω : = Hξ ,
with [ξ] = ω. Moreover, we put H(Q, ω): = H(Q, ξω ), see (8.1).
    For ϑ ⊂ K b a finite subset, let X∧                                          ∧
                                      Q,∗,ds (ϑ) denote the collection of ω ∈ XQ,∗,ds
that have a KQ -type in common with τϑ .

                                 b be a finite subset. Then X∧
Lemma 9.1 Let Q ∈ Pσ and let ϑ ⊂ K                           Q,∗,ds (ϑ) is
finite. Moreover,

                       A2,Q (τϑ ) = ⊕ω∈X∧Q,∗,ds (ϑ) A2,Q (τϑ )ω ,

where the direct sum is finite and orthogonal.

Proof: The collection X∧    Q,∗,ds (ϑ) is finite by Lemma 3.2, applied to the spaces
XQ,v , for v ∈ W. Put τ = τϑ and fix v ∈ Q W. We note that A2 (Q, v : τQ )ω = 0
                Q

for ω ∈ X∧                ∧
            Q,∗,ds (ϑ) \ MvHv −1 ,ds (τQ ), by Remark 3.3, with XQ,v , τQ in place of
X, τ. Moreover, by the same remark,

                 A2 (XQ,v : τQ ) = ⊕ω∈X∧Q,∗,ds(ϑ) A2 (XQ,v : τQ )ω ,

with orthogonal summands. The result now follows by summation over v ∈ Q W,

                                                               Q,∗,ds . Then
H(Q, ω)ϑ 6= 0 if and only if ω ∈ X∧
                                  Q,∗,ds (ϑ).

Proof: We have that H(Q, ω)ϑ = V̄ (Q, ξω ) ⊗ L2 (K : ξω )ϑ , with non-trivial first
component in the tensor product. Hence, H(Q, ω)ϑ is non-trivial if and only if
L2 (K : ξω )ϑ is. Since L2 (K : ξω ) is the representation space for IndK
                                                                        KQ (ξω ), the
assertion follows by Frobenius reciprocity.                                        
    If Q ∈ Pσ , we define the Hilbert space

                                   b ω∈X∧
                           H(Q): = ⊕           H(Q, ω),                           (9.1)

where the hat over the direct sum symbol indicates that the natural Hilbert
space completion of the algebraic direct sum is taken. Let ϑ ⊂ K b be a finite
subset. In view of Lemmas 9.1 and 9.2 it follows that we may define a map
                           Ψϑ = ΨQ,ϑ : H(Q)ϑ → A2,Q (τϑ )
as the direct sum of the isometries T 7→ ψT : H(Q, ω)ϑ → A2,Q (τϑ )ω , for ω ∈
X∧Q,∗,ds (ϑ), see (4.13). The following result is immediate.

Lemma 9.3 Ψϑ is an isometric isomorphism from H(Q)ϑ onto A2,Q (τϑ ).
   If f ∈ Cc∞ (X)K then for Q ∈ Pσ , ω ∈ X∧                      ∗
                                                Q,∗,ds and ν ∈ iaQq we define the
Fourier transform fˆ(Q : ω : ν) ∈ V̄ (ξω ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξω )K by

                             fˆ(Q : ω : ν): = fˆ(Q : ξω : ν).
                                                                 / ∪H∨ (Q, ξ).
This definition is justified since it follows from (4.19) that ν ∈

Proposition 9.4 Let ϑ ⊂ K     b be a finite set of K-types, let f ∈ C ∞ (X)ϑ and
                                                                     c
                    ∞
let F = ςϑ (f ) ∈ Cc (X : τϑ ) be the associated spherical function, see Lemma
3.4. Then for each Q ∈ Pσ and every ν ∈ ia∗Qq ,
                            X
              FQ F (ν) =           ψfˆ(Q : ω : ν)  in    A2,Q (τϑ ).        (9.2)

                               Q,∗,ds



If fˆ(Q : ω : ν) is non-zero, then ω ∈ X∧Q,∗,ds (ϑ); in particular, the above sum is
finite. Finally,
                                 X
               kFQ F (ν)k2 =           kfˆ(Q : ω : ν)k2V̄ (ξω )⊗L2 (K : ξω ) .

                                  Q,∗,ds



Proof: It follows from Lemma 7.2 that fˆ(Q : ω : ν) is an element of H(Q, ω)ϑ ,
for every ω ∈ X∧ Q,∗,ds . Hence, if this element is non-zero, then ω belongs to the
finite set X∧
            Q,∗,ds (ϑ).
    The identity (9.2) follows from Lemma 7.5, since Ψϑ is a surjective isometry.
The final assertion follows by once more using that Ψϑ is an isometry.           
    The following result will turn out to be the Plancherel identity for K-
finite functions. We recall from [12], Def. 13.4, that two parabolic subgroups
P, Q ∈ Pσ are said to be associated if their σ-split components aP q and aQq are
conjugate under W. The equivalence relation of associatedness on Pσ is denoted
by ∼ . Let Pσ ⊂ Pσ be a choice of representatives for Pσ / ∼ . If Q ∈ Pσ , then
WQ∗ denotes the normalizer of aQq in W.

    Our next goal is to show that the above indeed corresponds with a direct
integral decomposition for the left regular representation L of G in L2 (X).
    Let Q ∈ Pσ . For ω ∈ X∧ Q,∗,ds , the direct integral representation πQ,ω : = πQ,ξω
of G in L2 (Q, ω): = L2 (Q, ξω ) is unitary, see Lemma 8.1. We define

                          L2 (Q): = ⊕
                                    b ω∈X∧
                                         Q,∗,ds
                                                L2 (Q, ω),                      (9.3)

where the hat over the direct sum sign has the same meaning as in (9.1). We
note that L2 (Q) is naturally isometrically isomorphic with the Hilbert space
of H(Q)-valued L2 -functions on ia∗Qq , relative to the measure [W : WQ∗ ] dµQ .
Let πQ be the associated direct sum of the representations πQ,ω . Then πQ is a
unitary representation of G in L2 (Q).
   Finally, we define
                             L2 : = ⊕Q∈Pσ L2 (Q)                           (9.4)
and equip it with the direct sum inner product. The direct sum being finite, L2
becomes a Hilbert space in this way. The associated direct sum π = ⊕Q∈Pσ πQ
is a unitary representation of G in L2 .
    For Q ∈ Pσ and ω ∈ X∧                                               2
                          Q,∗,ds we denote the natural inclusion map L (Q, ω) →
  2                              2      2
L by iQ,ω ; its adjoint prQ,ω : L → L (Q, ω) is the natural projection map. If
ϕ ∈ L2 , we denote its component prQ,ω ϕ ∈ L2 (Q : ω) by ϕ(Q : ω : · ). Thus,
                     X      X                 Z
           kϕk2L2 =                [W : WQ∗ ]     kϕ(Q : ω : ν)k2 dµQ .

                             Q,∗,ds



It follows from Theorem 9.5 that the Fourier transform fˆ of an element f ∈
Cc∞ (X)K belongs to L2 . Moreover,

                                 kf kL2 (X) = kfˆkL2 .

Theorem 9.6 The map f 7→ fˆ has a unique extension to a continuous linear
map F: L2 (X) → L2 . The map F is isometric and intertwines the G-representations
(L, L2 (X)) and (π, L2 ).

Proof: The first two assertions are obvious from the discussion preceding the
theorem. It remains to prove the intertwining property. Fix Q ∈ Pσ and
ω ∈ X∧ Q,∗,ds ; then it suffices to prove that FQ,ω : = prQ,ω ◦ F intertwines L with
πQ,ω . We will do this in a number of steps. For convenience, we write ξ = ξω .

Lemma 9.7 Let f ∈ Cc∞ (X).
 (a) If k ∈ K, then FQ,ω (Lk f ) = πQ,ω (k)FQ,ω f.
 (b) If u ∈ U (g), then

                          hFQ,ω (Lu f ) | ϕi = hFQ,ω (f ) | π(ǔ)ϕi             (9.5)

      for all ϕ ∈ L2 (Q, ω)∞ .


                                          37
Proof: We first assume that f is K-finite. Assertion (a) is an immediate
consequence of the K-equivariance asserted in Lemma 7.2.
   In view of Lemma 8.6 it suffices to prove assertion (b) for ϕ ∈ L20 (Q, ω). In
view of Lemma 8.3 we may as well assume that u = X ∈ g. Then the expression
on the left-hand side of (9.5) equals
                  Z
                       h(LX f )ˆ(Q : ξ : ν) | ϕ(ν)iH(Q,ω) dµQ (ν).
                      ia∗
                        Qq


The integrand is continuous and compactly supported as a function of ν. By
the g-equivariance asserted in Lemma 7.2 and unitarity of the representations
πQ,ξ,−ν for all ν ∈ ia∗Qq , we see that the integral equals
Z
        hfˆ(Q : ξ : ν) | [I ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν (X̌)]ϕ(ν)i dµQ (ν)
 ia∗
   Qq
                                    Z
                               =            hfˆ(Q : ξ : ν) | [πQ,ω (X̌)ϕ](ν)i dµQ (ν),
                                     ia∗
                                       Qq


see also Lemma 8.3. The expression on the right-hand side of the latter equality
equals the one on the right-hand side of (9.5). This establishes the result for f
in the dense subspace Cc∞ (X)K of Cc∞ (X). The idea is to extend the result by
an argument involving continuity.
    For assertion (a) we proceed as follows. Fix k ∈ K. Then the map f 7→
Lk f is continuous from Cc∞ (X) to L2 (X). Since FQ,ω is continuous L2 (X) →
L2 (Q, ω), by the first part of the proof of Theorem 9.6, whereas πQ,ω is a unitary
representation, it follows that both f 7→ FQ,ω Lk f and f 7→ πQ,ω (k)FQ,ω f are
continuous maps from Cc∞ (X) to L2 (Q, ω). Hence, (a) follows by continuity and
density.
    Finally, for the proof of (b) we fix u ∈ U (g) and ϕ ∈ L2 (Q, ω)∞ . Then the
map f 7→ Lu f is continuous from Cc∞ (X) to L2 (X), whereas FQ,ω is continuous
from L2 (X) to L2 (Q, ω) as said above. It follows that the inner product on
the left-hand side of (9.5) depends continuous linearly on f ∈ Cc∞ (X). Since
πQ,ω (ǔ)ϕ is a fixed element of L2 (Q, ω), the same holds for the inner product
on the right-hand side of (9.5). Thus, (b) follows by continuity and density from
the similar statement for K-finite functions.                                    

Lemma 9.8 Let f ∈ Cc∞ (X). Then

                             FQ,ω (Lx f ) = πQ,ω (x)FQ,ω (f )

for all x ∈ G.

Proof: By Lemma 9.7 (a) it suffices to prove the identity for x in the connected
component of G containing e. Hence it suffices to establish the identity for
x ∈ exp(g). Write π = πQ,ω and fix X ∈ g. Then it suffices to show that



                                              38
π(exp tX)−1 FQ,ω (Lexp tX f ) is a constant function of t ∈ R with value FQ,ω (f ).
For this it suffices to show that, for every ϕ ∈ L2 (Q, ω)∞ , the function

                     Φ: t 7→ hπ(exp tX)−1 FQ,ω (Lexp tX f ) | ϕi

is differentiable with derivative zero. We observe that

                      Φ(t) = hFQ,ω (Lexp tX f ) | π(exp tX)ϕi.

The L2 (X)-valued function t 7→ Lexp tX f is C 1 on R, with derivative t 7→
LX Lexp tX f. Moreover, since ϕ is a smooth vector, the L2 (Q, ω)-valued function
t 7→ π(exp tX)ϕ is also C 1 on R, with derivative t 7→ π(X)π(exp tX). By conti-
nuity of FQ,ω and the inner product on L2 (Q, ω), it follows that Φ(t) is C 1 with
derivative given by

Φ′ (t) = hFQ,ω (LX Lexp tX f ) | π(exp tX)ϕi + hFQ,ω (Lexp tX f ) | π(X)π(exp tX)ϕi.

The latter expression equals zero by Lemma 9.7 (b), applied with Lexp tX f and
π(exp tX)ϕ in place of f and ϕ, respectively.                                
    End of proof of Theorem 9.6: In the beginning of the proof of the
theorem, we established that FQ,ω is a continuous linear map from L2 (X) to
L2 (Q, ω). By density of Cc∞ (X)K in L2 (X) and continuity of the representations
L and πQ,ω , the G-equivariance of FQ,ω follows from Lemma 9.8.                
    Let Q ∈ Pσ and let ϑ ⊂ K b be a finite subset. We recall from [12], Thm. 23.4,
that the spherical Fourier transform FQ associated with τ = τϑ , originally
defined as a continuous linear map C(X : τϑ ) → S(ia∗Qq )⊗A2,Q (τϑ ), has a unique
extension to a continuous linear map L2 (X : τϑ ) → L2 (ia∗Qq )⊗A2,Q (τϑ ), denoted
by the same symbol. For application in the next section, we state the relation
between the extended spherical Fourier transform FQ and F in a lemma. Let prQ
denote the projection operator L2 → L2 (Q) associated with the decomposition
(9.4).

Lemma 9.9 Let Q ∈ Pσ and let ϑ ⊂ K          b be a finite subset. Let f ∈ L2 (X)ϑ
                       2
and let F = ςϑ (f ) ∈ L (X : τϑ ) be the associated spherical function, see Lemma
3.4. Then
                         FQ F (ν) = ΨQ,ϑ (prQ ◦ Ff (ν)),                      (9.6)
for almost all ν ∈ ia∗Qq . Here ΨQ,ϑ is the isometry of Lemma 9.3.

Proof: For f ∈ Cc∞ (X)ϑ we have prQ ◦ Ff (ν) = fˆ(Q : · : ν), so that (9.6)
follows from (9.2) and the definition of ΨQ,ϑ before Lemma 9.3. The general
result follows from this by density of Cc∞ (X)ϑ in L2 (X)ϑ and continuity of the
maps FQ ◦ ςϑ and (I ⊗ ΨQ,ϑ ) ◦ prQ ◦ F from L2 (X)ϑ to L2 (ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q (τϑ ), see
[12], Thm. 23.4, and Lemmas 3.4, 9.3 and Theorem 9.6.                             

10      The Plancherel decomposition
Our goal in this section is to establish the Plancherel decomposition. For this
we need to characterize the image of the transform F, defined in the previous
section. To achieve this we shall first decompose F into pieces corresponding
with the parabolic subgroups from Pσ .
    Let Q ∈ Pσ . For ϑ ⊂ K       b a finite subset, we defined in [12], text before
Thm. 23.1 a subspace CQ (X : τϑ ) of C(X : τϑ ), as the image of the wave packet
transform JQ . In [12], text before Cor. 23.3, we defined L2Q (X : τϑ ) as the closure
of CQ (X : τϑ ) in L2 (X : τϑ ). Accordingly, we denote by L2Q (X)ϑ the canonical
image of L2Q (X : τϑ ) in L2 (X)ϑ , cf. Lemma 3.4. Finally, we denote by L2Q (X)
the L2 -closure of the union of such spaces for all ϑ. Then it follows from [12],
Cor. 23.3, that
                               L2 (X) = ⊕Q∈Pσ L2Q (X),                          (10.1)
with orthogonal K-invariant direct summands.

Lemma 10.1 Let Q ∈ Pσ . The space L2Q (X) is G-invariant. Moreover, F
maps L2Q (X) into L2 (Q).

Proof: We shall first prove the second assertion. Fix P ∈ Pσ , P 6= Q and
assume that ϑ ⊂ K  b is a finite subset. Then it follows from [12], Cor. 23.3 and
Thm. 23.4 (c), that FP = 0 on L2Q (X : τϑ ). In view of Lemma 9.9 this implies
that prP ◦ F(f ) = 0 for every f ∈ L2Q (X)ϑ ; here prP denotes the orthogonal
projection L2 → L2 (P ). By density of L2Q (X)K in L2Q (X) and continuity of
the map prP ◦ F: L2 (X) → L2 (P ), see Theorem 9.6, it follows that prP ◦ F van-
ishes on L2Q (X), for every P ∈ Pσ \ {Q}. The second assertion now follows by
orthogonality of the decomposition (9.4).
    Since F is an isometry, its adjoint F∗ is surjective from L2 onto L2 (X).
Moreover, since F is compatible with the decompositions (10.1) and (9.4), it
follows by orthogonality of the mentioned decompositions that

                               L2Q (X) = F∗ (L2 (Q)).

By G-equivariance of F and unitarity of the representations L and π, the map
F∗ is G-equivariant. If follows that L2Q (X) is G-invariant.               
   We denote by FQ the restriction of F to L2Q (X), viewed as a map into L2 (Q).

Corollary 10.2 The map F is the direct sum of the maps FQ , for Q ∈ Pσ .

    If H is a Hilbert space, we denote by End(H) the space of continuous linear
endomorphisms of H, equipped with the operator norm. By U(H) we denote the
subspace of unitary endomorphisms. If P ∈ Pσ , we define W (aP q ) = W (aP q |
aP q ) as in [12], § 3. Then by [12], Cor. 3.5,

                                W (aP q ) ≃ WP∗ /WP .                          (10.2)


                                         40
Proposition 10.3 For each s ∈ W (aQq ) there exists a measurable map CQ,s : ia∗Qq →
End(H(Q)), which is almost everywhere uniquely determined, such that ν 7→
kCQ,s (ν)k is essentially bounded, and such that for every f ∈ Cc∞ (X),
                           FQ f (sν) = CQ,s (ν) FQ f (ν),                      (10.3)
for almost all ν ∈ ia∗Qq . For almost every ν ∈ ia∗Qq the map CQ,s (ν) is unitary.
Moreover, for all s, t ∈ W (aQq ),
                           CQ,st (ν) = CQ,s (tν) ◦ CQ,t (ν).                   (10.4)
In particular, CQ,1 (ν) = I and CQ,s (ν)−1 = CQ,s−1 (sν), for all s ∈ W (aQq ).
    For Q minimal this result is part of Prop. 18.6 in [8]. In the present more
general setting, we initially reason in a similar way. For Ω ⊂ ia∗Qq a measurable
subset, we denote by L2Ω (Q) the closed G-invariant subspace of L2 (Q) consisting
of square integrable functions ia∗Qq → H(Q) that vanish almost everywhere
outside Ω. The orthogonal projection onto this subspace is denoted by ϕ 7→ ϕΩ .
    The uniqueness statement of Proposition 10.3 follows from the following
lemma, which generalizes [8], Lemma 18.7. We denote by a∗reg Qq the collection of
elements H ∈ a∗Qq whose parabolic equivalence class relative to (a∗q , Σ) is open
in a∗Qq . The set a∗reg
                   Qq   consists of finitely many connected components, called
chambers. The group W (aQq ) acts freely, but in general not transitively, on the
collection of chambers; therefore, there exists an open and closed fundamental
domain for W (aQq ) in a∗reg
                          Qq .

Lemma 10.4 Let Ω ⊂ ia∗reg Qq be an open and closed fundamental domain for
W (aQq ). Then f 7→ (prQ Ff )Ω maps Cc∞ (X) onto a dense subspace of L2Ω (Q),
                                                                          b
and Cc∞ (X)ϑ onto a dense subspace of L2Ω (Q)ϑ , for every finite set ϑ ⊂ K.
Proof: The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 18.7 of [8]. Fix a finite
subset ϑ ⊂ K; then it suffices to prove the statement about Cc∞ (X)ϑ , by density
of the K-finite vectors. Let T ∈ L2Ω (Q)ϑ , and suppose that hprQ FfP    | T i = 0 for
all f ∈ Cc∞ (X)ϑ . Then it suffices to show that T = 0. Put T (ν) = ω T (ω : ν)
with T (ω : ν) ∈ H(Q, ω)ϑ . Note that this sum is finite by Lemmas 9.1 and 9.2.
Let τ = τϑ , then ψT (ω : ν) ∈ A2,Q (τ ). We put
                                           X
                Ψ(ν): = Ψϑ (T (ν)) =             ψT (ω : ν) ∈ A2,Q (τ ).

Note that for Q minimal, the constants dω that occur in [8] are absent here, see
Remark 4.1. Let F ∈ Cc∞ (X : τ ), and let f = F ( · )(e), then f ∈ Cc∞ (X)ϑ and
F = ςϑ (f ), see Lemma 3.4. Moreover, as in [8], proof of Lemma 18.7,

                    hFQ F | Ψi = hfˆ(Q) | T i = hprQ Ff | T i = 0.             (10.5)

Let the space [L2 (ia∗Qq ) ⊗ A2,Q (τ )]W (aQq ) be defined as in [12], text before
Cor. 22.2. It follows from the definition of this space that the restriction map
ϕ 7→ ϕ|Ω is a bijection from it onto L2 (Ω) ⊗ A2,Q (τ ).

                                          41
   The image of Cc∞ (X : τ ) under FQ is dense in the space [L2 (ia∗Qq )⊗A2,Q (τ )]W (aQq ) ,
by [12], Thm. 23.4 (c). Combining this with (10.5) we see that Ψ is perpen-
dicular to the mentioned space. Since Ψ = 0 outside Ω, we infer that Ψ|Ω is
perpendicular to L2 (Ω) ⊗ A2,Q (τ ). We conclude that Ψ, hence T, is zero.         

Proof of Proposition 10.3: We fix a finite subset ϑ ⊂ K       b and put τ = τϑ . We
will first prove that there exists a measurable map CQ,s,ϑ : ia∗Qq → End(H(Q)ϑ ),
such that (10.3) is valid with CQ,s,ϑ in place of CQ,s , for every f ∈ Cc∞ (X)ϑ . We
define
                        CQ,s,ϑ (ν) = Ψ−1    ◦
                                      ϑ ◦ CQ|Q (s : ν) ◦ Ψϑ ,                 (10.6)
where Ψϑ is the isometry from H(Q)ϑ onto A2,Q (τ ) defined in the text preceding
Lemma 9.3 and where the C-function is defined as in [12], Def. 17.6, with τ = τϑ .
We note that the End(H(Q)ϑ )-valued function CQ,s,ϑ is analytic on ia∗Qq , by [12],
Cor. 18.6. It follows from Lemma 9.3 combined with the Maass–Selberg relations
for the C-function, see [12], Thm. 18.3, that CQ,s,ϑ (ν) maps H(Q)ϑ unitarily into
itself, for ν ∈ ia∗Qq . From (10.6) and [12], Lemma 22.1 with P = R = Q, we
deduce that (10.4) is valid with everywhere the index ϑ added.
    In view of Lemma 10.4, the function CQ,s,ϑ is uniquely determined by the
requirements in the beginning of this proof. If ϑ′ ⊂ K        b is a second finite subset
with ϑ ⊂ ϑ′ , let iϑ′ ,ϑ denote the inclusion map H(Q)ϑ → H(Q)ϑ′ , and let prϑ,ϑ′
denote the orthogonal projection H(Q)ϑ′ → H(Q)ϑ . Then it follows from the
uniqueness that
                         prϑ,ϑ′ ◦ CQ,s,ϑ′ (ν) ◦ iϑ′ ,ϑ = CQ,s,ϑ (ν),
for every ν ∈ ia∗Qq . By unitarity of the endomorphisms CQ,s,ϑ (ν) and CQ,s,ϑ′ (ν)
this implies that CQ,s,ϑ′ (ν) leaves the subspace H(Q)ϑ of H(Q)ϑ′ invariant, and
equals CQ,s,ϑ (ν) on it. Thus, we may define the endomorphism CQ,s (ν) of h(Q)
                                                                                 b
by requiring it to be equal to CQ,s,ϑ (ν) on h(Q)ϑ , for every finite subset ϑ ⊂ K.
The endomorphism defined depends measurably on ν, has essentially bounded
norm and satisfies (10.3). We asserted already that it is uniquely determined
by these properties, in view of Lemma 10.4. The remaining asserted properties
of CQ,s (ν) follow from the discussion above.                                    

Lemma 10.5 Let Q ∈ Pσ and let Ω be an open and closed fundamental domain
for the W (aQq )-action in ia∗reg
                             Qq . Then the map f 7→ |W (aQq )|
                                                               1/2

                                   2            2
an isometric isomorphism from LQ (X) onto L (Q)Ω , intertwining the restriction
of L to L2Q (X) with the direct integral representation

                              Ω

of G in L2 (Q)Ω .

Proof: In view of Theorem 9.6 and Lemma 10.1, the map FQ is an isome-
try from L2Q (X) into L2 (Q), intertwining the restriction of L to L2Q (X) with


                                              42
πQ : = π|L2 (Q) . The map ϕ 7→ ϕΩ from L2 (Q) to L2 (Q)Ω intertwines πQ with
the direct integral (10.7). Thus, it remains to show that the map T : f 7→
|W (aQq )|1/2 (FQ f )Ω from L2Q (X) to L2 (Q)Ω is isometric and onto.
    To establish the first property, we note that, for f ∈ L2Q (X) and s ∈ W (aQq ),
                   kFQ f (sν)k = kCQ,s (ν)FQ f (ν)k = kFQ f (ν)k,
for almost every ν ∈ ia∗Qq , by Proposition 10.3. Hence,

It follows that T is an isometry. On the other hand, T has dense image in view
of Corollary 10.2 and Lemma 10.4. We conclude that T is surjective.          
    We shall now investigate irreducibility and equivalence of the occurring rep-
resentations πQ,ω,ν .
Lemma 10.6 Let π ∈ X∧      ds . Then π has a real infinitesimal Z(g)-character in
the following sense. Let j be a Cartan subalgebra of g, W (j) the Weyl group of
the root system Σ(j) of jC in gC . Let [Λ] ∈ j∗C /W (j) be the infinitesimal character
of π. Then hΛ , αi is real for every α ∈ Σ(j).
Proof: Let b a θ-stable Cartan subspace of q, let Σ(b) be the root system of b
in gC , W (b) the associated Weyl group and I(b) the algebra of W (b)-invariants
in S(b), the symmetric algebra of bC . Let γb : D(X) → I(b) be the associated
Harish-Chandra isomorphism. Let L2 (X)π be defined as in (3.2) with π in place
of ξ. We may fix a non-zero simultanous eigenfunction f for D(X) in [L2 (X)π ]∞ .
Let λ ∈ b∗C be such that Df = γb (D : λ)f for D ∈ D(X). Then in particular, for
each element Z of Z, the center of U (g),
                                    RZ f = γb (Z : λ)f.                              (10.8)
On the other hand, RZ f = LŽ f may be expressed in terms of the infinitesimal
character of π as follows. Let j be a θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of g, containing
b, let Σ(j) and W (j) be as in the lemma, and let I(j) denote the algebra of
W (j)-invariants in S(j). We denote the canonical isomorphism Z → I(j) by γj .
Let Λ ∈ jC be as in the lemma, then
                       RZ f = LŽ f = γj (Ž : Λ)f = γj (Z : −Λ)f.                   (10.9)
From (10.8) and (10.9) we obtain that
                         γj (Z : −Λ) = γb (Z : λ),             (Z ∈ Z).             (10.10)

                                                  43
Let l be the centralizer of b in g, let Σ(lC , j) be the root system of j in lC , Σ+ (lC , j)
a choice of positive roots and δl ∈ j∗C the associated half sum of the positive roots.
By a standard computation in the universal enveloping algebra, involving the
definitions of γj and γb , it follows that γb (Z : λ) = γj (Z : λ − δl ), for all Z ∈ Z.
Combining this with (10.10) we obtain that −Λ and λ − δl are W (j)-conjugate.
    Now hλ , αi is real, for each α ∈ Σ(b), by [26], see also [12], Thm. 16.1. It
readily follows that Λ is real.                                                           
   The following result is due to F. Bruhat [14] for minimal parabolic subgroups
and to Harish-Chandra in general. A proof is essentially given in [23].

Theorem 10.7 For j = 1, 2, let Pj = Mj Aj Nj be a parabolic subgroup of G,
with the indicated Langlands decomposition. Moreover, let ξj be an irreducible
unitary representation of Mj with real infinitesimal character and let νj ∈ ia∗j be
regular with respect to the roots of aj in Pj . Let πj denote the unitarily induced
representation IndGPj (ξj ⊗ νj ⊗ 1).

 (a) The representation πj is irreducible, for j = 1, 2.
 (b) The representations π1 and π2 are equivalent if and only if the data (aj , νj , [ξj ]),
     for j = 1, 2, are conjugate under K. The latter condition means that there
     exists k ∈ K such that Ad(k)a1 = a2 , ν1 ◦ Ad(k)−1 = ν2 and ξ1k ∼ ξ2 ,
     where ξ1k : = ξ1 (k −1 ( · )k)|M2 .

Proof: Taking into account the actions of the centers of Mj and G, one readily
checks that it suffices to prove this result for G connected semisimple and with
finite center. Thus, let us assume this to be the case.
    Assertion (a) follows from [23], Thm. 4.11. Thus, it remains to prove as-
sertion (b). We first establish the ‘if’ part. If in addition to the hypothesis,
P2 = kP1 k −1 , then the equivalence of π1 , π2 is a trivial consequence of conju-
gating all induction data. Thus, by applying conjugation we may reduce to the
case that a1 = a2 , ν1 = ν2 and ξ1 ∼ ξ2 . Then P1 and P2 have the same split
component. It now follows from [22], Prop. 8.5 (v), that there exists a unitary
intertwining operator from π1 onto π2 . Hence π1 ∼ π2 .
    We shall now prove the ‘only’ if part. Assume that π1 ∼ π2 . By conjugating
all induction data of π1 with an element of K, we see that we may restrict
ourselves to the situation that P1 and P2 contain a fixed minimal parabolic
subgroup P0 of G, with split component A0 . In particular, aj ⊂ a0 for j = 1, 2.
It now follows from [23], p. 94, text under the heading ‘Equivalence’, that there
exists a k ∈ NK (a0 ) such that Ad(k)a1 = a2 and ν1 ◦ Ad(k)−1 = ν2 . Conjugating
all data of π1 with k we see that we may as well assume that a1 = a2 and
ν1 = ν2 . Moreover, applying [22], Prop. 8.5 (v), as in the first part of this
proof we see that in addition we may assume that P1 = P2 . We now claim that
ξ1 ∼ ξ2 . This assertion is essentially proved in [23], proof of Thm. 4.11, but not
explicitly stated as a result. We shall indicate how to modify the mentioned
proof. We use the notation of [23]. In particular, ξj = ◦ σj . We follow the proof
of [23], Thm. 4.11, after the heading ‘equivalence’, but with P1 = P2 = P and


                                             44
ν1 = ν2 = ν. From i(π1 , π2∗ ) > 0 it follows, by application of [23], Thm. 4.10,
that
                            (0)
                      (M1 ⊗ (E10 ⊗E   ¯ 20 ′ )′ ⊗ C′1 )(P ⊗P )
                                    (0)
has positive dimension. Now M1 equals C ∞ (P ), equipped with the left times
right action of P (see [23], Eqn. (2.6)). Hence the above space is naturally
isomorphic with the space of diag(P × P )-invariants in (E10 ⊗E    ¯ 20 ′ )′ which in
turn is naturally isomorphic with HomP (E20 , E10 ) = HomM (◦ σ2 , ◦ σ1 ). It follows
that the latter space is non-trivial, hence ◦ σ1 ∼ ◦ σ2 , since the representations
involved are irreducible.                                                          

Proposition 10.8 For j = 1, 2, let Qj ∈ Pσ , ωj ∈ MQ       ∧

                                                                 , νj ∈ ia∗reg
                                                                          Qj q . Then
the representations πj = πQj ,ωj ,νj are irreducible. Moreover, they are equivalent
if and only if Q1 = Q2 and there exists s ∈ W (aQ1 q ) such that ν2 = sν1 and
ω2 = sω1 .

Proof: Put ξj = ξωj and Q = Q1 . There exists v ∈ Q W, such that ω1 belongs
to the discrete series of MQ /MQ ∩ vHv −1 . It follows from Lemma 10.6 that ω1
has a real infinitesimal character for the center of U (mQ ). A similar statement
holds for Q2 , ω2 .
      If α is a root of aQ in Q, then its restriction αq to aQq belongs to Σr (Q).
Moreover, hα , ν1 i = hα|aQq , ν1 i =6 0. Thus, it follows that ν1 is regular with
respect to the aQ -roots in Q. A similar statement holds for ν2 .
      Thus, Theorem 10.7 is applicable and we conclude that π1 and π2 are irre-
ducible.
      Assume that π1 ∼ π2 . Then by Theorem 10.7 (b) we conclude that there
exists k ∈ K such that Ad(k)a1 = a2 , ν1 ◦ Ad(k)−1 = ν2 and ξ1k ∼ ξ2 . Since
σνj = −νj , for j = 1, 2, it follows by application of σ that also ν1 ◦ Ad(σk)−1 =
ν2 . We infer that Ad((σk)−1 k)−1∗ centralizes ν1 , hence belongs to the centralizer
M1Q of aQq , by regularity of ν1 . The mentioned element therefore centralizes aQ ,
from which we see that Ad(k) = Ad(σk) on aQ . This implies that σ ◦ Ad(k) =
Ad(k) ◦ σ on aQ , hence Ad(k) maps aQq onto aQ2 q . We conclude that Q1 and
Q2 are associated, hence equal. Put Q = Q1 = Q2 .
      It follows from the above that Ad(k) normalizes aQq . Hence, s: = Ad(k)|aQq
belongs to W (aQq ), see [12], § 3. Finally, it follows that sν1 = ν2 and s[ξ1 ] =
[ξ1k ] = [ξ2 ].                                                                   

induced representation πQ,ω,ν occurs with multiplicity mQ,ω = dim V̄ (Q, ω), for
almost every ν ∈ ΩQ .

Proof: The fact that F induces the isometric isomorphism of L with the direct
integral as expressed by (10.11) and (10.12) follows from Lemma 10.5 applied
to −ΩQ in place of Ω, combined with Corollary 10.2 and (10.2). The occurring
representations πQ,ω,ν are all irreducible, by Proposition 10.8. It remains to
exclude double occurrences. For j = 1, 2, let Qj ∈ Pσ , ωj ∈ MQ  ∧

and assume that πQ1 ,ω1 ,ν1 ∼ πQ2 ,ω2 ,ν2 . Then it follows from Proposition 10.8
that Q1 = Q2 . Moreover, there exists s ∈ W (aQ1 q ) such that (sν1 , sω1 ) =
(ν2 , ω2 ). Since ΩQ1 = ΩQ2 is a fundamental domain for the W (aQ1 q )-action, it
follows that s = 1.                                                                
      We finish this section with a description of the image of the isometry F: L2 (X) →

Lemma 10.10 Let Q ∈ Pσ and s ∈ W (aQq ). Then for almost every ν ∈ ia∗Qq ,
the unitary endomorphism CQ,s (ν) of H(Q) maps the subspace H(Q, ω) onto
H(Q, sω), for ω ∈ X∧
                   Q,∗,ds , intertwining the representations πQ,ω,ν and πQ,sω,sν .

Proof: Let s ∈ W. We will first show that, for almost every ν ∈ ia∗Qq , the
unitary endomorphism CQ,s (ν) of H(Q) intertwines the direct sum πQ,ν of the
representations 1 ⊗ πQ,ω,−ν , for ω ∈ X∧Q,∗,ds , with the similar direct sum πQ,sν
of the representations 1 ⊗ πQ,ω,−sν . Let Ω be an open and closed fundamental
domain for the W (aQq )-action on ia∗reg
                                     Qq . Then the map FQΩ : f 7→ FQ (f )Ω is an
equivariant isometry from L2Q (X) onto L2 (Q)Ω , by Lemma 10.5. Similarly, the
map FQ sΩ is an intertwining isomorphism from L2Q (X) onto L2 (Q)sΩ . Moreover,
by (10.3), for every f ∈ L2Q (X) we have

                   s∗ (FQ sΩ f )(ν) = FQ sΩ f (sν) = CQ,s (ν)FQΩ f (ν),

for almost every ν ∈ Ω. It follows that the map ϕ 7→ s∗−1 [CQ,s ( · )ϕ] is an
equivariant isometry from L2 (Q)Ω onto L2 (Q)sΩ . Let x ∈ G. Then

                      s∗ πQ (x)s∗−1 [CQ,s ( · )ϕ] = CQ,s ( · )πQ (x)ϕ,

for every ϕ ∈ L2 (Q). It follows that

                          πQ,sν (x)CQ,s (ν) = CQ,s (ν)πQ,ν (x)                    (10.13)

for almost every ν ∈ Ω. Since Ω was arbitrary, (10.13) holds for almost every
ν ∈ ia∗Qq . Select a countable dense subset G0 of G. Then there exists a subset

                                                 46
A ⊂ ia∗reg
         Qq   with complement of measure zero in ia∗Qq , such that CQ,s ( · ) is
represented by a function on A with values in U(H(Q)), satisfying (10.13) for
all x ∈ G0 and ν ∈ A. By continuity of CQ,s (ν) and of the representations πQ,ν
and πQ,sν , it follows that (10.13) holds for all ν ∈ A and all x ∈ G. In view of
Theorem 10.7, the representation 1 ⊗ πQ,ω̃,−sν , for ω̃ ∈ X∧ Q,∗,ds and s ∈ A, is
not disjoint from 1 ⊗ πQ,ω,−ν , if and only if ω̃ = sω. All assertions now follow
for all ν ∈ A.                                                                  
   It follows from the above result that for each s ∈ W (aQq ), we may define a
unitary endomorphism ΓQ (s) of L2 (Q) by

                       [ΓQ (s)ϕ](ν) = CQ,s (s−1 ν)ϕ(s−1 ν),

for ϕ ∈ L2 (Q) and almost every ν ∈ ia∗Qq . Moreover, the map ΓQ (s) intertwines
πQ with itself. It follows from Proposition 10.3 that s 7→ ΓQ (s) defines a unitary
representation of W (aQq ) in L2 (Q), commuting with the action of G. Accord-
ingly, the associated space L2 (Q)W (aQq ) of invariants is a closed G-invariant
subspace of L2 (Q).

Theorem 10.11

 (a) For each Q ∈ Pσ , the image of FQ equals L2 (Q)W (aQq ) .
 (b) The image of the Fourier transform F is given by the following orthogonal
     direct sum
                         im (F) = ⊕Q∈Pσ L2 (Q)W (aQq ) .

Proof: From Proposition 10.3 it follows that FQ maps into L2 (Q)W (aQq ) . Thus,
for (a) it remains to prove the surjectivity. Let Ω be an open and closed fun-
damental domain in ia∗regQq for the action of W (aQq ). Then the map ϕ 7→ ϕ|Ω
is a bijection from L2 (Q)W (aQq ) onto L2 (Q)Ω . The surjectivity now follows by
application of Lemma 10.5.
    Finally, assertion (b) follows from (a) combined with Corollary 10.2.       


11     H-fixed generalized vectors, final remarks
In this section we compare our results with those obtained by P. Delorme in [21].
This comparison relies heavily on the automatic continuity theorem, due to W.
Casselman and N.R. Wallach, see [18], Cor. 10.5 and [29], Thm. 11.6.7. We
shall therefore first recall this result. The group decomposes as G ≃ ◦ G×exp cp ,
where, as usual, ◦ G denotes the intersection of all subgroups ker |χ|, with χ a
continuous homomorphism G → R∗ , and where cp = center(g) ∩ p. Accordingly,
we define the function k · k: G → ] 0, ∞ [ by

                          kx exp Hk = kAd(x)kop e|H| ,                      (11.1)



                                        47
for x ∈ ◦ G and H ∈ cp ; here k · kop denotes the operator norm on End(g). Let
ap be a maximal abelian subspace of p containing aq , and let Σ(ap ) be the root
system of ap in g. Then one readily checks that
                              kk1 ak2 k = max aα ,                            (11.2)
                                           α∈Σ(ap )

for k1 , k2 ∈ K and a ∈ Ap ∩ ◦ G. In particular, it follows that k · k ≥ 1 on G.
Note that it follows from (11.1) and (11.2) that
                            kxk = kx−1 k        (x ∈ G).                      (11.3)
We recall from [29], 11.5.1, that a smooth representation π of G in a Fréchet
space V is said to be of moderate growth if for each continuous seminorm s on
V there exists a continuous seminorm ps on V and a constant ds ∈ R such that
                              s(π(x)v) ≤ kxkds ps (v),
for all v ∈ V and x ∈ G.
Theorem 11.1 (The automatic continuity theorem) Let (πj , Vj ), for j =
1, 2, be smooth Fréchet representations of G of moderate growth, such that
the associated (g, K)-modules (Vj )K are finitely generated. Then every (g, K)-
equivariant linear map (V1 )K → (V2 )K extends (uniquely) to a continuous linear
G-equivariant map V1 → V2 . Moreover, the image of the extension is a closed
topological summand of V2 .
Remark 11.2 A proof of this theorem, due to W. Casselman and N.R. Wal-
lach, is given in [18], Cor. 10.5 and in [29], Thm. 11.6.7, but for a somewhat
different class of real reductive groups. In [19], §1, it is shown that the result is
valid for groups of Harish-Chandra’s class.
    For any function f : G → C and any non-negative real number r ≥ 0 we
define
                           kf kr : = sup kxk−r |f (x)|.            (11.4)
                                     x∈G
Moreover, we define Cr (G) to be the space of continuous functions f : G → C
with kf kr < ∞. Then Cr (G), equipped with the norm k · kr , is a Banach space.
Lemma 11.3 For every g ∈ G, both the left regular action Lg and the right
regular action Rg leave the space Cr (G) invariant; their restrictions to the men-
tioned Banach space have operator norm at most kgkr .
Proof: For any function f : G → C, we define f ∨ : G → C by f ∨ (x) = f (x−1 ).
It follows from (11.3) and (11.4) that f 7→ f ∨ is an isometry from the Banach
space Cr (G) onto itself, intertwining Rg with Lg . Therefore, it suffices to prove
the assertions for the left action.
    In view of (11.1) it follows from the multiplicative property of the operator
norm that kgxk ≥ kg −1 k−1 kxk for all x, g ∈ G. Applying this inequality to the
definition of kLg f kr , for f ∈ Cr (G) and g ∈ G, we see that Lg acts on Cr (G)
with operator norm at most kg −1 kr . The lemma now follows by application of
(11.3).                                                                          

                                         48
    We note that the left regular representation L of G in Cr (G) is not continuous
if G is not compact. In fact, in that case there exists a function f ∈ Cr (G)
such that Lg f has no limit for g → e. However, L does induce a continuous
representation in a subspace that we shall now introduce.
    We define Cr∞ (G) to be the space of smooth functions f : G → C with Lu f ∈
Cr (G) for all u ∈ U (g). If F ⊂ U (g) is a finite subset, we define the seminorm
νF,r on Cr∞ (G) by
                              νF,r (f ): = max kLu f kr .
                                        u∈F

We equip  Cr∞ (G)  with the locally convex topology induced by the collection of
seminorms νF,R , for F ⊂ U (g) finite. It is readily seen that the space Cr∞ (G),
thus topologized, is a Fréchet space.

Remark 11.4 The space Cr∞ (G) has been introduced in [18], p. 424, where it
was denoted by Aumg,r (G). In the mentioned paper it is asserted that this space
is a continuous G-module of moderate growth for the left action. The following
result expresses that in fact this G-module is smooth.

Proposition 11.5 Let r ≥ 0. The space Cr∞ (G) is left G-invariant. Moreover,
the left regular representation L of G in Cr∞ (G) is a smooth Fréchet represen-
tation of moderate growth.

Proof: In [15], § 1, the space AN (G/H), for N ∈ N, is defined as the analogue
of Cr∞ (G), with respect to the norm function g 7→ kgσ(g)−1 k on G/H, in place of
the norm function k · k on G. Proposition 11.5 is the analogue of [15], Lemma 1.
The proof of the mentioned lemma may be transferred to the present situation
with obvious modifications.                                                    

Corollary 11.6 Let r ≥ 0. Every closed G-submodule of Cr∞ (G) is a smooth
Fréchet module of moderate growth.

Proof: Immediate. See also [29], Lemma 11.5.2.                                   

Proposition 11.7 Let (π, V ) be a smooth Fréchet representation of G of mod-
erate growth, such that VK is finitely generated. Let r ≥ 0 and let T : VK →
Cr∞ (G) be a (g, K)-equivariant linear map. The map T has a unique exten-
sion to a continuous linear G-equivariant map V → Cr∞ (G). The image of this
extension is closed.

Proof: Let W be the closure of the image of T in Cr∞ (G). Then W is a closed
G-submodule of Cr∞ (G), hence a smooth Fréchet module of moderate growth.
Moreover, WK = T (VK ) is finitely generated. By Theorem 11.1, T has a unique
extension to a continuous linear G-equivariant map T̃ : V → W. The image of
this extension is closed and contains a dense subspace of W, hence equals W. 




                                        49
Lemma 11.8 Let r ≥ 0. Then the space Cr∞ (G) is right G-invariant. More-
over, if y ∈ G, then the right regular action Ry restricts to a continuous linear
operator of Cr∞ (G).
Proof: It follows from Lemma 11.3 that Ry is a continuous linear endomor-
phism of Cr (G) with operator norm at most kykr . Since the action of Ry on
C ∞ (G) commutes with that of Lu , for every u ∈ U (g), it readily follows that
Ry leaves the space Cr∞ (G) invariant and restricts to a continuous linear endo-
morphism of it.                                                               
   Let r ≥ 0. We define
                          Cr∞ (X): = Cr∞ (G) ∩ C(G/H),
the space of right H-invariant functions in Cr∞ (G).
Lemma 11.9 Let r ∈ R. The space Cr∞ (X) is a closed G-submodule of Cr∞ (G).
In particular, it is a smooth Fréchet G-module of moderate growth.
Proof: For every h ∈ H, the map Rh − I restricts to a continuous linear
operator of Cr∞ (G), by Lemma 11.8. The space Cr∞ (X) equals the intersection
in Cr∞ (G) of the kernels of the operators Rh − I, for h ∈ H. Therefore, C ∞ (X)
is closed. The remaining assertion follows by application of Corollary 11.6. 

Remark 11.10 It follows from [4], Cor. 12.2, that the space Cr∞ (X) equals
the space AN (G/H), with N = 2r, defined in [15], § 1; the definition in the last
mentioned paper is given for N ∈ N, but makes sense for arbitrary real N ≥ 0.
Accordingly, Lemma 11.9 is due to [15]; see loc. cit. Lemma 1.
   If V is a locally convex space, we denote its continuous linear dual by V ′ .
Unless otherwise specified, we equip it with the strong dual topology.
Corollary 11.11 Let (π, V ) be a smooth Fréchet representation of G of moder-
ate growth, such that VK is finitely generated. Let r ∈ R and let T : VK → Cr∞ (X)
be a (g, K)-equivariant linear map.
  (a) The map T has a unique extension to a continuous linear G-equivariant
      map T̃ : V → Cr∞ (X).
 (b) The linear functional eve ◦ T : v 7→ T v(e) has a unique extension to a con-
     tinuous linear functional ηT ∈ V ′ .
 (c) The functional ηT is H-invariant and T̃ may be represented as the gener-
     alized matrix coefficient map given by
                      T (v)(x) = ηT (π(x)−1 v),      (x ∈ G/H).

Proof: From Proposition 11.7 it follows that T has a unique extension to a
continuous linear G-equivariant map T̃ : V → Cr∞ (G). The image of T̃ is a closed
subspace W of Cr∞ (G) which contains the image of T as a dense subspace. In
view of Lemma 11.9 it follows that W ⊂ Cr∞ (X). The extended functional is
given by ηT = eve ◦ T̃ : v 7→ T̃ v(e). The assertions of (c) readily follow by G-
equivariance.                                                                  

                                       50
    Using the above result we shall be able to express our Eisenstein integrals as
matrix coefficients of principal series representations. As a preparation we need
to relate the function k · k, defined in (11.1), to the G = KAq H-decomposition.
Following [12], Eqn. (10.1), we define the distance function lX : G → [0, ∞ [ by

                                 lX (kah) = | log a|,

for k ∈ K, a ∈ Aq and h ∈ H.

Lemma 11.12 There exists a constant s > 0 such that

                           elX (x) ≤ kxks ,     (x ∈ G).

Proof: One readily sees that it suffices to prove this in case G = ◦ G. Moreover,
since the functions of x on both sides of the equality are left K-invariant, we may
reduce to the case that G is connected and semisimple, with finite center. From
[6], Lemma 14.4, we deduce, using the equality kxk = kx−1 k, that kak ≤ kahk
for all a ∈ Aq and h ∈ H. Hence, by the G = KAq H decomposition, it suffices
to prove the estimate

                           e| log a| ≤ kaks    (a ∈ Aq ),                    (11.5)

for some s > 0 independent of a. Let m be the minimal value of the continuous
function max{α | α ∈ Σ(ap )} on the unit sphere in aq . Then m > 0. Using
(11.2) we see that the estimate (11.5) holds for s ≥ m−1 .                 
   Let Q ∈ Pσ and ξ ∈ X∧
                       Q,∗,ds be fixed throughout the rest of this section.

Lemma 11.13 Let ϑ ⊂ K       b be a finite subset, let ψ ∈ A2,Q (τϑ )ξ and let ν0 ∈
a∗QqC be a regular point for the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (Q : ψ : ν). There exist an
open neighborhood U of ν0 and a constant r > 0 such that ν 7→ E ◦ (Q : ψ : ν) is
a function on U with values in Cr∞ (X) ⊗ Vϑ . Moreover, the mentioned function
is locally bounded.

Proof: It follows from [12], Prop. 13.14, combined with Lemma 11.12, that
there exist an open neighborhood Ω of ν0 and a polynomial function p ∈
ΠΣr (Q) (a∗Qq ), such that the function ν 7→ p(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν) is holomorphic on Ω
as a function with values in Cr∞ (X) ⊗ Hom(A2,Q (τϑ ), Vϑ ) and such that for
every continuous seminorm µ on the latter tensor product space, the function
ν 7→ µ(p(ν)E ◦ (Q : ν)) is a bounded on Ω.
    Select an open neighborhood U of ν0 with compact closure contained in Ω
such that E ◦ (Q : ψ : · ) is holomorphic on an open neighborhood of U . Then
it follows by a straightforward application of Cauchy’s integral formula in the
variable ν, see, e.g., [4], proof of Lemma 6.1, that for every continuous seminorm
µ′ on Cr∞ (X) ⊗ Vϑ the function ν 7→ µ′ (E ◦ (Q : ψ : ν)) is bounded on U.       

Lemma 11.14 Let ν ∈ a∗QqC . The representation πQ,ξ,ν of G in C ∞ (K : ξ) is
a smooth Fréchet representation of moderate growth. Moreover, the associated
(g, K)-module C ∞ (K : ξ)K is finitely generated.

                                         51
Proof: It follows from Remark 4.2 that V : = C ∞ (K : ξ), equipped with πQ,ξ,ν ,
is the space of C ∞ -vectors for the Hilbert representation IndG
                                                               Q (ξ ⊗ ν ⊗ 1). It
now follows from [29], Lemma 11.5.1, that V is a smooth Fréchet G-module of
moderate growth. The last assertion is well known, see also Proposition 5.1 for
a stronger assertion.                                                         

Proposition 11.15 Let ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ).
 (a) There exists a constant r ∈ R such that JQ,ξ,ν maps V̄ (Q, ξ)⊗C ∞ (K : ξ)K
     into the space Cr∞ (X).
 (b) Let r ∈ R be a constant as in (a). The map JQ,ξ,ν has a unique extension
     to a continuous linear map from V̄ (Q, ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ) into Cr∞ (X). The
     extension intertwines the G-representations I ⊗ πQ,ξ,−ν and L.

Proof: Fix ν as above. By Lemma 11.14, there exists a finite subset ϑ ⊂ K     b
             ∞                       ∞
such that C (K : ξ)ϑ generates C (K : ξ)K as the (g, K)-module associated
with πQ,ξ,−ν . Let r ∈ R be associated with ϑ as in Lemma 11.13. Then it
follows from (4.20) that JQ,ξ,ν maps V̄ (Q, ξ) ⊗ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ into Cr∞ (X). The
map JQ,ξ,ν is (g, K)-equivariant, by Theorem 4.6. Since C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ generates
C ∞ (K : ξ)K , whereas Cr∞ (X) is (g, K)-invariant, assertion (a) follows.
    Assume that r is a constant as in (a). Then it follows from Theorem 4.6 that
the map JQ,ξ,ν is (g, K)-equivariant. In view of Lemma 11.14 and assertion (a),
we may apply Corollary 11.11 with T = JQ,ξ,ν . Assertion (b) follows.         
   If ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ), we denote the continuous linear extension of JQ,ξ,ν
by the same symbol. We denote the conjugate of the topological linear dual of
C ∞ (K : ξ) by C −∞ (K : ξ). The G-representation on the latter space induced
                                          −∞
by dualization of πξ,ν , is denoted by πξ,ν   .
   The sesquilinear pairing C (K : ξ) × C ∞ (K : ξ) → C, given by (4.5) in-
                                   ∞

duces a continuous linear embedding C ∞ (K : ξ) ֒→ C −∞ (K : ξ), intertwining
                                    −∞
the representations πξ,−ν̄ and πξ,ν    . The latter may therefore be viewed as the
continuous linear extension of πξ,−ν̄ . Accordingly, we shall sometimes use the
                                           −∞
notation πξ,−ν̄ for the representation πξ,ν    .
   We denote by V (Q, ξ) the conjugate space of V̄ (Q, ξ), and define the linear
map j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄): V (Q, ξ) → C −∞ (K : ξ) by

                    hϕ | j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄)(η)i = JQ,ξ,ν (η ⊗ ϕ)(e).         (11.6)

Then by Proposition 11.15 and Corollary 11.11, the image of j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄) is
contained in the subspace of C −∞ (K : ξ) consisting of H-invariants for the rep-
resentation πξ,ν̄ ; we agree to denote this subspace by C −∞ (Q : ξ : ν̄)H .
    We may now represent the Eisenstein integral as a matrix coefficient. The
following formula generalizes the similar formula for Q minimal, see [7], Eqn.
(53).




                                         52

Lemma 11.16 Let ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ), let ϑ ⊂ K
                         ∞
T = η ⊗ ϕ ∈ V̄ (Q, ξ) ⊗ C (K : ξ)ϑ . Then

   Eϑ (Q : ψT : ν)(x)(k) = hϕ | πQ,ξ,ν̄ (kx)j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄)ηi    (x ∈ X, k ∈ K).

Proof: This follows from (4.20) and (11.6), by application of Corollary 11.11
(c).                                                                       
    To identify our Eisenstein integral with the one introduced by P. Delorme
in [19], we recall some results from [16], §2.4.
    For each v ∈ Q W, we denote by V(Q, ξ, v) the space of MQ ∩ vHv −1 -fixed
elements in Hξ−∞ , the conjugate of the topological linear dual of Hξ∞ . The space
V(Q, ξ, v) is finite dimensional by [1], Lemma 3.3. We introduce the formal direct
sum
                           V(Q, ξ): = ⊕v∈Q W V(Q, ξ, v).
If u ∈ C −∞ (Q : ξ : ν)H , then on an open neighborhood of any v ∈ Q W in K, the
functional u may be represented by a unique continuous function with values in
Hξ−∞ , via the sesquilinear pairing (4.5). Its value evv (u) in v is therefore a well
defined element of V(Q, ξ, v). See [16], § 3.3, for details. The direct sum of the
maps evv , for v ∈ Q W, is denoted by

                ev = ⊕v∈Q W evv :        C −∞ (Q : ξ : ν)H → V(Q, ξ).

We have the following result, due to [3] for minimal Q and to [16] in general.

Theorem 11.17 There exists a unique meromorphic function j(Q, ξ, · ) on
a∗QqC with values in Hom(V(Q, ξ), C −∞ (K : ξ)) such that the following two con-
ditions are fulfilled.
 (a) For regular values of ν, the image of j(Q : ξ : ν) is contained in C −∞ (Q : ξ : ν)H .
 (b) For regular values of ν, we have ev ◦ j(Q : ξ : ν) = IV(Q,ξ) .
There exists a locally finite collection H = H(j, Q, ξ) of hyperplanes in a∗QqC such
that each ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H is a regular value for j(Q : ξ : · ) and the associated
map j(Q : ξ : ν) is surjective from V(Q, ξ) onto C −∞ (Q : ξ : ν)H .
    Finally, each ν ∈ a∗QqC with Re ν + ρQ stricly Σr (Q)-anti-dominant is a
regular value for j(Q : ξ : · ). Moreover, for such ν and every η ∈ V(Q, ξ), the
element j(Q : ξ : ν)η ∈ C −∞ (K : ξ) is representable by a continuous function
u: K → Hξ−∞ , in the sense that
                                 Z
         hϕ | j(Q : ξ : ν)ηi =       hϕ(k) | u(k)i dk,     (ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)).

    The Eisenstein integrals of Delorme are built in terms of matrix coefficients
coming from a subspace Vds (Q, ξ) of V(Q, ξ), which is defined as follows, see
[19], §8.3. Let v ∈ Q W. An element η ∈ V(Q, ξ, v) naturally determines the
MQ -equivariant embedding ιη : Hξ∞ → C ∞ (MQ /MQ ∩ vHv −1 ), given by

                      ιη (v)(m) = hξ(m)−1 v | ηi        (m ∈ MQ ).
We denote by Vds (Q, ξ, v) the subspace of η ∈ V(Q, ξ) with the property that
ιη maps into L2 (MQ /MQ ∩ vHv −1 )∞ . Note that for such η the map ιη extends
to a continuous linear map Hξ → L2 (XQ,v ); see [17], Lemma 1. Moreover, the
map η 7→ ιη defines a linear isomorphism from Vds (Q, ξ, v) onto V (Q, ξ, v), via
which we shall identify.
    We define the subspace Vds (Q, ξ) of V(Q, ξ) as the direct sum of the spaces
Vds (Q, ξ, v), for v ∈ Q W. Via the direct sum of the above isomorphisms, we
obtain the natural isomorphism
                                 Vds (Q, ξ) ≃ V (Q, ξ).
Accordingly, the map j ◦ introduced in (11.6) may be viewed as a linear map
                    j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν): Vds (Q, ξ) → C −∞ (Q : ξ : ν)H ,
defined for ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ).
    To relate this map with the map j(Q : ξ : ν) of Theorem 11.17 we need stan-
dard intertwining operators. We recall from [29] and [16] that for a parabolic
subgroup P ∈ Pσ with split component equal to AQ , the standard intertwin-
ing operator A(Q : P : ξ : ν) between the representations πP,ξ,ν and πQ,ξ,ν on
C ∞ (K : ξ) is given by an absolutely convergent integral for ν ∈ a∗QqC with
hRe ν −ρQ , αi > 0 for every α ∈ Σr (P )∩Σr (Q̄), and allows a meromorphic con-
tinuation in ν. Its adjoint is a continuous linear endomorphism of C −∞ (K : ξ),
                                    −∞         −∞
intertwining the representations πQ,ξ,ν  and πP,ξ,ν . It extends the standard inter-
twining operator A(P : Q : ξ : −ν̄), and is therefore denoted by the same symbol.
Thus,
                       A(Q : P : ξ : ν)∗ = A(P : Q : ξ : −ν̄).               (11.7)
We also recall that
          A(P : Q : ξ : ν) ◦ A(Q : P : ξ : ν) = η(Q : P : ξ : ν) IC ∞ (K : ξ)
with η(Q : P : ξ : · ) a non-zero scalar meromorphic function on a∗P qC = a∗QqC . In
particular, it follows that the standard intertwining operator is invertible for ν
in an open dense subset of a∗QqC .
Lemma 11.18 Let ν ∈ a∗QqC be such that Re ν −ρQ is strictly Σr (Q)-dominant.
Then, for every η ∈ V(Q, ξ) and ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)K , and for each v ∈ Q W, all
m ∈ MQ and all X ∈ a+Qq ,

       −ν+ρQ
 lim a         hϕ | πQ̄,ξ,ν̄ (mat v) j(Q̄ : ξ : ν̄)ηi = hA(Q : Q̄ : ξ : −ν)ϕ(e) | ξ(m)ηv i,
t→∞ t

where at = exp tX.

                                            54
Proof: The result is equivalent to Lemma 16 in [19]. We refer to the proof
given there.                                                            

Theorem 11.19 Let η ∈ Vds (Q, ξ). Then j ◦ (Q : ξ : · )η is holomorphic as a
function on a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ), with values in C −∞ (K : ξ). Moreover,

                  j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν)η = A(Q̄ : Q : ξ : ν)−1 j(Q̄ : ξ : ν)η,

as an identity of meromorphic C −∞ (K : ξ)-valued functions in ν ∈ a∗QqC \
∪H(Q, ξ). In particular, j ◦ (Q : ξ : · )η extends to a meromorphic C −∞ (K : ξ)-
valued function on a∗QqC .

   For the proof of this result we need the following lemma.

Lemma 11.20 Let ϑ ⊂ K     b be a finite subset. There exists an open dense subset
Ω of the set of points ν ∈ a∗QqC with Re ν strictly Σr (Q)-dominant, such that
the following holds. Let ψ ∈ A2,Q (τϑ ), v ∈ Q W, m ∈ XQ,v,+ , X ∈ a+ Qq and put
at = exp tX, (t ∈ R). Then, for every ν ∈ Ω,
                         −ν+ρQ
                   lim a         E ◦ (Q : ψ : ν)(mat v) = (ψ)v (m).
                  t→∞ t

Proof: Let ω be the set of regular points for E ◦ (Q : · ), and ω+ the subset of
ν ∈ ω with Re ν strictly Σr (Q)-dominant.
    Fix a minimal parabolic group P from Pσ , contained in Q. Then, by [12],
                                                                   hyp
Prop. 13.15, the family f : (ν, x) 7→ E ◦ (Q : ν : x)ψ belongs to EQ   (X : τ ). More-
over, for each u ∈ NK (aq ), the set of exponents Exp (P, u | fν ) is contained in
the collection W P |Q (ν + Λ(P |Q)) − ρP − N∆(P ), for ν ∈ ω.
    Fix ν ∈ ω+ and let ξ be an exponent in Exp (Q, v | fν ). Then it follows
by application of [11], Thm. 3.5, that ξ = w(ν + Λ)|aQq − ρQ − µ, for certain
w ∈ W P |Q , Λ ∈ Λ(P |Q) and µ ∈ N∆r (Q). It follows from the definitions
preceding [12], Prop. 13.15, that wΛ ∈ −R+ ∆(P ). Hence Re ξ(X) + ρQ (X) ≤
wRe ν(X), with equality if and only if wΛ|aQq = 0 and µ = 0. Now Re ν is
strictly Σr (Q)-dominant and X ∈ a+    Qq , Hence, by a well known result on root
systems, Re ν(X) ≥ Re sν(X), for each s ∈ W, with equality if and only if s
centralizes aQq . Since W P |Q ∩ WQ = {e}, we conclude that

                             Re ξ(X) < (Re ν − ρQ )(X)

for every exponent ξ ∈ Exp (Q, v | fν ), different from ν − ρQ . It follows that
                    −ν+ρQ
              lim a         fν (mat v) = lim qν−ρQ (Q, v | fν , tX)(m),        (11.8)
             t→∞ t                        t→∞

for every ν ∈ ω+ for which the limit on the right-hand side exists. It follows
from [12], Def. 13.7and Prop. 13.6, that there exists a non-empty open subset
Ω0 of a∗QqC such that

                          qν−ρQ (Q, v | fν , X)(m) = ψv (m)                    (11.9)

                                           55
for all ν ∈ Ω0 , v ∈ QcW, m ∈ XQ,v,+ and X ∈ aQq . On the other hand, by
[11], Thm. 7.7, there exists an open dense subset Ω1 of a∗QqC such that the
expression on the left-hand side of (11.9) depends holomorphically on ν ∈ Ω1 ,
for all v, m, X as above. By analytic continuation it follows that (11.9) is valid
for ν ∈ Ω1 . This implies that the limit on the right-hand side of (11.8) has the
value ψv (m), for every ν ∈ ω+ ∩ Ω0 .                                           
    Proof of Theorem 11.19: Fix ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)K with ϕ(e) 6= 0 and put
T = η ⊗ ϕ. Select a finite subset ϑ ⊂ K   b such that ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)ϑ . Then,
in the notation of , ψT ∈ A2 (τϑ ). Fix v ∈ Q W. Then the preimage MQ,v,+ of
XQ,v,+ under the canonical map MQ → XQ,v is open dense in MQ . Fix m ∈ MQ
and X ∈ a+ Qq . We agree to write at = exp tX. Let A be the open dense subset
of a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ) consisting of points ν where both intertwining operators
ν 7→ A(Q : Q̄ : ξ : −ν)± are regular. By Lemma 11.16 we may write, for ν ∈ A,

    Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : ν)(mat v)(e) =
      =   hϕ | πQ,ξ,ν̄ (mat v)j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄)i
      =   hA(Q : Q̄ : ξ : −ν)−1 ϕ | πQ̄,ξ,ν̄ (mat v)A(Q̄ : Q : ξ : ν̄)j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄)ηi.

Replacing A if necessary, we may in addition assume that the conjugate Ā of A
has empty intersection with the set ∪H, where H = H(j, Q̄, ξ) is as in Theorem
11.17, with Q̄ in place of Q̄. By the mentioned theorem it then follows, for
ν ∈ A, that
                A(Q̄ : Q : ξ : ν̄)j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄)η = j(Q̄ : ξ : ν̄)η(ν̄), (11.10)
for η(ν̄) ∈ V(Q̄, ξ) given by η(ν̄) = ev ◦ A(Q̄ : Q : ξ : ν̄)j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄)η. Using
Lemma 11.18 we now conclude that, for ν ∈ A with Re ν − ρQ strictly Σr (Q)-
dominant,
                     −ν+ρQ
               lim a         Eϑ◦ (Q : ψT : ν)(mat v)(e)
              t→∞ t
                 =    hϕ(e) | ξ(m)evv ◦ A(Q̄ : Q : ξ : ν̄)j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν̄)ηi
                 =    hϕ(e) | η(ν̄)v i.                                              (11.11)

In particular, this holds for ν contained in the non-empty open set A ∩ Ω, with
Ω as in Lemma 11.20. For such ν it follows by the mentioned lemma that the
limit in (11.11) also equals (ψT )v (m) = hϕ(e) | ξ(m)ηv i. We deduce that, for
ν ∈ Ā ∩ Ω̄, where the bar denotes conjugation,

                       hϕ(e) | ξ(m) η(ν)v i = hϕ(e) | ξ(m)ηv i,                      (11.12)

for all m ∈ MQ,v,+ . By continuity and density it follows that the identity (11.12)
holds for all m ∈ MQ . Since ϕ(e) ∈ Hξ∞ \ {0}, it follows by irreducibility of the
G-module Hξ∞ that η(ν)v = ηv , for all ν ∈ Ā ∩ Ω̄. This identity holds for every
v ∈ Q W, since the sets A and Ω are independent of the element v ∈ Q W.
Combining this with (11.10) we deduce that, for every ν ∈ Ā ∩ Ω̄,

                 j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν)η = A(Q̄ : Q : ξ : ν)−1 j(Q̄ : ξ : ν)η.              (11.13)

                                            56
Let f (ν) denote the expression on the left-hand side and g(ν) that on the right-
hand side of the above equation. Then g is a meromorphic C −∞ (K : ξ)-valued
function on a∗QqC , by Theorem 11.17 and meromorphy of the intertwining op-
erator. If ϕ ∈ C ∞ (K : ξ)K , then ν 7→ hf (ν) | ϕi is a holomorphic function of
ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ), by Lemma 11.16. On the other hand, ν 7→ hg(ν) | ϕi is a
meromorphic function on a∗QqC . By analytic continuation we deduce that

                               hf (ν) | ϕi = hg(ν) | ϕi,                       (11.14)

as an identity of meromorphic functions in the variable ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ).
From the holomorphy of the function on the left-hand side it follows that the
function on the right-hand side is actually regular on a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ), for every
ϕ ∈ C −∞ (K : ξ)K . The latter space is dense in C ∞ (K : ξ) and ν 7→ gf (ν)
is a meromorphic C −∞ (K : ξ)-valued function. It follows that g is regular on
a∗QqC \∪H(Q, ξ). It now follows from (11.14) that the element f (ν) ∈ C −∞ (K : ξ)
equals g(ν), for every ν ∈ a∗QqC \ ∪H(Q, ξ). This implies all assertions of the
theorem.                                                                        
    It follows from the above result that the distribution vector j ◦ (Q : ξ : ν)η, de-
fined for η ∈ Vds (Q, ξ), coincides with the similarly denoted distribution vector
defined in [7], (3.13).

Corollary 11.21 Let (τ, Vτ ) be a finite dimensional unitary representation of
K, let P ∈ Pσ and ψ ∈ A2 (P, τ ). Then the Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P : ψ : λ), for
λ ∈ a∗P qC , coincides with the normalized Eisenstein integral E ◦ (P, ψ, −λ) defined
in [17], § 5.1.

Proof: By the functorial property of Lemma 4.5, which is satisfied by both
Eisenstein integrals, it suffices to prove the result for τ = τϑ , with ϑ ⊂ K  b a
finite subset. By linearity it suffices to prove the assertion for ψ = ψη⊗f , where
ξ ∈ X∧                                      ∞
        P,∗,ds , η ∈ Vds (P, ξ) and f ∈ C (K : ξ)ϑ . The associated normalized
                                    ◦
Eisenstein integral is denoted E (P, ψ, ν) in [17], §5.1. It is represented as a
matrix coefficient in [17], Prop. 4. This representation coincides with the one
given in Lemma 11.16.                                                            
    It follows from the equality of the normalized Eisenstein integrals stated
above, that the Plancherel theorems formulated in [12], § 23, and Section 10,
coincide with the ones of P. Delorme formulated in [21], Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
However, the chosen normalizations of measures are different, resulting in differ-
ent constants. We shall finish this section by relating the various constants. The
normalization of measures for the present paper is described in [12], § 5. The
normalization given in [21], §0, follows essentially the same conventions of inter-
dependence, with one crucial difference. A choice of invariant measure dx for X,
determines the same choice of Haar measure da for Aq in both papers. In our
paper we fix the Lebesgue measure dλ on ia∗q that makes the Euclidean Fourier
transform an isometry from L2 (Aq , da) onto L2 (ia∗q , |W | dλ). On the other hand,
in [21], §0, the convention is to fix the measure dλ′ : = |W | dλ instead.


                                          57
    If Q ∈ Pσ , the same convention applies to the normalizations of invariant
measures dxQ,v on XQ,v , for v ∈ Q W, versus a choice of normalization of daQ
on the group ∗ AQq , which is ‘the Aq of (MQ , MQ ∩ vHv −1 ).’ This determines a
normalization dλQ of Lebesgue measure on i ∗ a∗Qq . The corresponding measure
of [21] is given by dλ′Q = |WQ | dλQ . In both papers, one chooses the measure on
ia∗Qq to be the quotient of the chosen measures on ia∗q and i∗ a∗Qq . This results
in a choice of Lebesgue measure dµQ on ia∗Qq in the present paper. The similar
measure dµ′Q in [21] is then given by dµ′Q = [W : WQ ] dµQ . For the constants in
the Plancherel formula, see e.g. [12], Thm. 23.1 (d), this means that [W : WQ∗ ]
should be replaced by

               [W : WQ ]−1 [W : WQ∗ ] = [WQ∗ : WQ ]−1 = |W (aQq )|−1 .

The latter is indeed the constant occurring in, e.g., [21], Thm. 3 (iii).
