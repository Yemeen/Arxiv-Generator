                                             Abstract. In this paper all of the classical constructions of A. Young are generalized to affine
                                             Hecke algebras of type A. It is proved that the calibrated irreducible representations of the affine
                                             Hecke algebra are indexed by placed skew shapes and that these representations can be constructed
                                             explicitly with a generalization of Young’s seminormal construction of the irreducible representa-
                                             tions of the symmetric group. The seminormal construction of an irreducible calibrated module
                                             does not produce a basis on which the affine Hecke algebra acts integrally but using it one is able
                                             to pick out a different basis, an analogue of Young’s natural basis, which does generate an integral
                                             lattice in the module. Analogues of the “Garnir relations” play an important role in the proof.
                                             The Littlewood-Richardson coefficients arise naturally as the decomposition multiplicities for the
                                             restriction of an irreducible representation of the affine Hecke algebra to the Iwahori-Hecke algebra.

                                                                                             0. Introduction
                                                  My recent work [Ra3], [Ra4] on the representations of affine Hecke algebras has been strongly
                                             motivated by the classical theory of Young tableaux. This research has resulted in the generaliza-
                                             tion of many of A. Young’s constructions to general finite root systems. With these generaliza-
                                             tions of standard Young tableaux one is able to use Young’s classical “seminormal construction”
                                             to construct irreducible representations of affine Hecke algebras corresponding to arbitrary finite
                                             crystallographic root systems.
                                                  Because the classical combinatorics of Young tableaux is much more advanced than that of
                                             the newly developed generalization it is often possible to give simpler proofs and more extensive
                                             results for the case of affine Hecke algebras of type A. The purpose of this paper is to compile some
                                             of these results and proofs. In particular, we obtain a generalization of Young’s natural basis and
                                             derive certain induction and restriction rules which are not yet available in the general case. It will
                                             also be more clear from the exposition here, how the generalization of the Young tableau theory
                                             given in [Ra3] and [Ra4] relates to the classical setup, something which is not always obvious when
                                             working in the general root system context.
                                             The main results
                                              (1) The definition of calibrated representations, and the classification and construction of all
                                                  irreducible calibrated representations of the affine Hecke algebra type A.
                                             These representations are indexed by placed skew shapes. The dimension of an irreducible cal-
                                             ibrated representation is the number of standard tableaux of the corresponding skew shape and

the representation is constructed by explicit formulas which give the action of each generator of
the affine Hecke algebra on a specific basis, the elements of which are indexed by standard Young
tableaux. This is a generalization of the constructions of A. Young [Y], P. Hoefsmit [Ho], H. Wenzl
[Wz], and Ariki and Koike [AK] (see [Ra2] for a review of some of the unpublished results of Hoef-
smit). Parts of Theorem 4.1 were first discovered by Cherednik and are stated (without proof)
in [Ch]. I am grateful to A. Zelevinsky for pointing this out to me and to I. Cherednik for some
informative discussions.
 (2) The definition of an analogue of Young’s natural basis for each irreducible calibrated repre-
     sentation.
Young’s natural basis is the one that is most often used in the study of irreducible representations
of the symmetric group, it is the one that is usually taken as the basis of the “Specht module”,
see for example [JK], [Sg], [Fu]. It has the wonderful property that it is an integral basis for the
module, i.e. the matrices representating the action of the symmetric group on this basis contain
integer entries. This is especially important because it opens the door to a combinatorial study of
the modular representations of the symmetric group.
     Using the analogue of the seminormal basis for the irreducible calibrated representations of
the affine Hecke algebra we can define an analogue of Young’s natural basis in each of these
representations. As desired, this basis is an integral basis of the module; the matrices representing
the action of the affine Hecke algebra on this basis have all entries in the ring Z[q, q −1 ]. These
results are a q-analogue of some of the results in [GW].
     One of the pleasant surprises one has when generalizing Young’s natural basis from this point
of view is that the “Garnir relations” take a particularly simple form: If {vL } is Young’s seminormal
basis and {nL } is Young’s natural basis then the relations

                          vL = 0,      when L is not a standard tableau,

are the Garnir relations. One recovers the Garnir relations in their classical form by expanding
the vL in terms of the nL .
(3) The classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficients describe the decomposition of the restriction
    of an irreducible representation of the affine Hecke algebra to the Iwahori-Hecke algebra.
This result gives a completely new (and unexpected) representation theoretic interpretation of the
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
(4) Skew shapes arise naturally as indexes for the irreducible calibrated representations of the
    affine Hecke algebra of type A.
Until now skew shapes have appeared in the combinatorial literature as something of a novelty, a
useful combinatorial tool which indexes some strangely well-behaved representations of the sym-
metric group. It has always been a surprise that the combinatorics of the irreducible represen-
tations of the symmetric group generalizes so beautifully to this special class of highly reducible
representations of the symmetric group.
     This fact is no longer strange. In fact, these representations are irreducible representations
of the affine Hecke algebra, and thus are basic and fundamental. Several of the skew Schur func-
tion identities in [Mac] I can be given representation theoretic interpretations in this context, see
Theorem 6.2 and Corollary 6.3.

which played an important role in my progress. There were several times when I tapped into J.
Stembridge’s fountain of useful knowledge about root systems. G. Benkart was a very patient
listener on many occasions. H. Barcelo, P. Deligne, T. Halverson, R. Macpherson and R. Simion
all gave large amounts of time to let me tell them my story and every one of these sessions was
helpful to me in solidifying my understanding.
     I single out Jacqui Ramagge with special thanks for everything she has done to help with
this project: from the most mundane typing and picture drawing to deep intense mathematical
conversations which helped to sort out many pieces of this theory. Her immense contribution is
evident in that some of the papers in this series on representations of affine Hecke algebras are
joint papers.

                           1. The affine Hecke algebra of type A

Affine braids. There are three common ways of depicting affine braids [Cr], [GL], [Jo]:
(a) As braids in a (slightly thickened) cylinder,
(b) As braids in a (slightly thickened) annulus,
(c) As braids with a flagpole.
See Figure 1. The multiplication is by placing one cylinder on top of another, placing one annulus
inside another, or placing one flagpole braid on top of another. These are equivalent formulations:
an annulus can be made into a cylinder by turning up the edges, and a cylindrical braid can be
made into a flagpole braid by putting a flagpole down the middle of the cylinder and pushing the
pole over to the left so that the strings begin and end to its right.
     The group formed by the affine braids with n strands is the affine braid group B̃n of type A.
Let ω, Ti for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and xi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, be as given in Figure 2. The following identities
can be checked by drawing pictures:

               (a) Ti Tj = Tj Ti ,                                for |i − j| > 1,

               (b) Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 ,                    for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,

               (c) ωTi ω −1 = Ti−1 ,                              for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,

               (d) xi Tj = Tj xi ,                                if |i − j| > 1,

               (e) xi+1 = Ti xi Ti ,                              for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,           (1.1)

               (f) xi xj = xj xi ,                                for 1 ≤ i, j, ≤ n,

               (g) xn x−1
                       1 = T0 Tn−1 · · · T2 T1 T2 · · · Tn−1 ,


               (h) xn = ωT1 T2 · · · Tn−1 ,

               (i) ω n = x1 x2 · · · xn ,
4                                                  arun ram

where the indices on the elements Ti are taken modulo n. The elements Ti , 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and ω
generate B̃n . The braid group is the subgroup Bn generated by the Ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. The elements
xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, generate an abelian group X ⊆ B̃n . If γ = (γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γn ) ∈ Zn define

                                             xγ = xγ11 xγ22 · · · xγnn .                                 (1.2)

The symmetric group Sn acts on Zn by permuting the coordinates. This action induces an action
on X by
                            wxγ = xwγ ,    for w ∈ Sn , γ ∈ Zn .

The affine Hecke algebra. Fix an element q ∈ C∗ which is not a root of unity. The affine
Hecke algebra H̃n is the quotient of the group algebra CB̃n by the relations

                                   Ti2 = (q − q −1 )Ti + 1,           0 ≤ i ≤ n.                         (1.3)

The images of Ti , xi and ω in H̃n are again denoted by Ti , xi and ω. The Laurent polynomial ring
C[X] = C[x±1            ±1
           1 , . . . , xn ] is a (large) commutative subalgebra of H̃n .
                        −1
    The relations Ti = Ti − (q − q −1 ) and xi+1 = Ti xi Ti can be used to derive the identities

             xi+1 Ti = Ti xi + (q − q −1 )xi+1 ,        and        xi Ti = Ti xi+1 − (q − q −1 )xi+1 .   (1.4)

More generally, if γ = (γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γn ) ∈ Zn then

                                                                 (xγ − xsi γ )xi+1
                                xγ Ti = Ti xsi γ + (q − q −1 )                     ,                     (1.5)
                                                                    xi+1 − xi

where si ∈ Sn is the simple transposition (i, i + 1). The right hand term in this expression
can always be written as a Laurent polynomial in x1 , . . . , xn . This important relation is due to
Bernstein, Zelevinsky and Lusztig [Lu]. The affine Hecke algebra H̃n can be defined as the algebra
generated by Ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n subject to the relations in (1.1a), (1.1b), (1.1f), (1.3)
and (1.5).
The symmetric group. The simple transpositions are the elements si = (i, i + 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
in Sn . A reduced word for a permutation w ∈ Sn is an expression w = si1 · · · sip of minimal length.
This minimal length is called the length ℓ(w) of w. The symmetric group Sn is partially ordered
by the Bruhat-Chevalley order: v ≤ w if a reduced expression si1 · · · sip for w has a subword
sik1 · · · sikℓ , 1 ≤ k1 < · · · < kℓ ≤ p which is equal to v in Sn .

The Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hn is the subalgebra of H̃n generated
by the elements Ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. For each w ∈ Sn let

                                               Tw = Ti1 · · · Tip ,                                      (1.6)

where w = si1 · · · sip is a reduced word for w. Since the Ti satisfy the braid relations (1.1a,b), the
element Tw is independent of the choice of the reduced word of w. The elements Tw , w ∈ Sn , are
a basis of Hn [Bou, IV §2 Ex. 23].

                                  2. Tableau combinatorics

Skew shapes and standard tableaux. A partition λ is a collection of n boxes in a corner.
We shall conform to the conventions in [Mac] and assume that gravity goes up and to the left.




Any partition λ can be identified with the sequence λ = (λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . .) where λi is the number
of boxes in row i of λ. The rows and columns are numbered in the same way as for matrices. In
the example above we have λ = (553311). If λ and µ are partitions such that µi ≤ λi for all i we
write µ ⊆ λ. The skew shape λ/µ consists of all boxes of λ which are not in µ. Any skew shape is a
union of connected components. Number the boxes of each skew shape λ/µ along major diagonals
from southwest to northeast and

                            write boxi to indicate the box numbered i.

     Let λ/µ be a skew shape with n boxes. A standard tableau of shape λ/µ is a filling of the
boxes in the skew shape λ/µ with the numbers 1, . . . , n such that the numbers increase from left
to right in each row and from top to bottom down each column. Let

                            F λ/µ = {standard tableaux of shape λ/µ}.

The column reading tableau C of shape λ/µ is the standard tableau obtained by entering the
numbers 1, 2, . . . , n consecutively down the columns of λ/µ, beginning with the southwest most
connected component and filling the columns from left to right. The row reading tableau R of shape
λ/µ is the standard tableau obtained by entering the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n left to right across the
rows of λ/µ, beginning with the northeast most connected component and filling the rows from
top to bottom. In general, if L is a standard tableau and w ∈ Sn then wL will denote the filling
of λ/µ obtained by permuting the entries of L according to the permutation w.

Proposition 2.1. [BW, Theorem 7.1] Given a standard tableau L of shape λ/µ define the word
of L to be permutation                                    
                                      1      ···     n
                           wL =
                                   L(box1 ) . . . L(boxn )
where L(boxi ) is the entry in boxi of L. Let C and R be the column reading and row reading
tableaux of shape λ/µ, respectively. The map

                                          F λ/µ   −→    Sn
                                            L     7−→   wL

defines a bijection from F λ/µ to the interval [wC , wR ] in Sn (in the Bruhat-Chevalley order).

Placed skew shapes. Let R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )) = {a + bi | a ∈ R, 0 ≤ b ≤ 2π/ ln(q 2 )} ⊆ C. If q is
a positive real number then the function

                                R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )) −→    C∗
                                                                         2
                                          x            7−→   q 2x = eln(q )x

is a bijection. The elements of [0, 1) + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )) index the Z-cosets in R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )).
     A placed skew shape is a pair (c, λ/µ) consisting of a skew shape λ/µ and a content function

                       c: {boxes of λ/µ} −→ R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 ))       such that

     c(boxj ) ≥ c(boxi ),                         if i < j and c(boxj ) − c(boxi ) ∈ Z,
     c(boxj ) = c(boxi ) + 1,        if and only if boxi and boxj are on adjacent diagonals, and
     c(boxi ) = c(boxj ),               if and only if boxi and boxj are on the same diagonal.

This is a generalization of the usual notion of the content of a box in a partition (see [Mac] I §1
Ex. 3).
      Suppose that (c, λ/µ) is a placed skew shape such that c takes values in Z. One can visualize
(c, λ/µ) by placing λ/µ on a piece of infinite graph paper where the diagonals of the graph paper
are indexed consecutively (with elements of Z) from southeast to northwest. The content of a
box b is the index c(b) of the diagonal that b is on. In the general case, when c takes values in
R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )), one imagines a book with r pages of infinite graph paper where the diagonals
of the graph paper are indexed consecutively (with elements of Z) from southeast to northwest.
The pages are numbered by values β1 , . . . , βr from the set [0, 1) + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )) and there is a
skew shape λ(k) /µ(k) placed on page βk . The skew shape λ/µ is a union of the disjoint skew shapes
λ(i) /µ(i) ,
                                   λ/µ = λ(1) /µ(1) ∪ · · · ∪ λ(r) /µ(r) ,

and the content function is given by

      c(b) = (page number of the page containing b) + (index of the diagonal containing b).


Example. The following diagrams illustrate standard tableaux and the numbering of boxes in a
skew shape λ/µ.

Lemma 2.2. Let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape with n boxes and let L be a standard tableau
of shape λ/µ. Let L(i) denote the box containing i in L. The content sequence

                                         (c(L(1)), . . . , c(L(n))

uniquely determines the shape (c, λ/µ) and the standard tableau L.

Proof. Proceed by induction on the number of boxes of L. If L has only one box then the content
sequence (c(L(1)) determines the placement of that box. Assume that L has n boxes. Let L′ be
the standard tableau determined by removing the box containing n from L. Then L′ is also of skew
shape and the content sequence of L′ is (c(L(1)), . . . , c(L(n − 1))). By the induction hypothesis we
can reconstruct L′ from its content sequence. Then c(L(n)) determines the diagonal which must
contain box n in L. So L′ and c(L(n)) determine L uniquely.



                                  3. Weights and weight spaces

     A finite dimensional H̃n -module is calibrated if it has a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors for
the xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In other words, M is calibrated if it has a basis {vt } such that for all vt in the
basis and all 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
                                 xi vt = ti vt ,  for some ti ∈ C∗ .

Weights. Let X be the abelian group generated by the elements x1 , . . . , xn ∈ H̃n and let

                                    T = {group homomorphisms X → C∗ }.

The torus T can be identified with (C∗ )n by identifying the element t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) ∈ (C∗ )n with
the homomorphism given by t(xi ) = ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The symmetric group Sn acts on Zn by
permuting coordinates and this action induces an action of Sn on T given by
                                                    −1
                                   (wt)(xγ ) = xw        γ

with notation as in (1.2).
Weight spaces. Let M be a finite dimensional H̃n -module. For each t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) ∈ T the
t-weight space of M and the generalized t-weight space are the subspaces

               Mt = {m ∈ M | xi m = ti m for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n}                          and


            Mtgen = {m ∈ M | for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, (xi − ti )k m = 0 for some k ∈ Z>0 },

respectively. From the definitions, Mt ⊆ Mtgen and M                               gen
                                                    Lis calibrated if and only if Mt = Mt for
                gen
all t ∈ T . If Mt 6= 0 then Mt 6= 0. In general M 6= t∈T Mt , but we do have

                                                                       Mtgen .

This is a decomposition of M into Jordan blocks for the action of C[X] = C[x±1           ±1
                                                                            1 , . . . , xn ]. The
set of weights of M is the set

                                        supp(M ) = {t ∈ T | Mtgen 6= 0}.                                                 (3.1)

An element of Mt is called a weight vector of weight t.

sense that they act on each generalized weight space Mtgen of M separately. The operator τi is
only defined on the generalized weight spaces Mtgen such that ti 6= ti+1 .

     whenever both sides are well defined.

Proof. (a) Note that (q−q −1 )xi+1 /(xi+1 −xi ) is not a well defined element of H̃n or C[x±1                            ±1
                                                                                                            1 , . . . , xn ]
since it is a power series and not a Laurent polynomial. Because of this we will be careful to view
(q −q −1 )xi+1 /(xi+1 −xi ) only as an operator on Mtgen . Let us describe this operator more precisely.
                                            gen
     The element xi x−1    i+1 acts on Mt       by ti t−1
                                                       i+1 times a unipotent transformation. As an operator
      gen
on Mt , (1−xi xi+1 ) = xi+1 /(xi+1 −xi ) is invertible since it has determinant (1−ti t−1
                     −1                                                                                     d
                                                                                                      i+1 ) where d =
dim(Mtgen ). Since this determinant is nonzero (q − q −1 )xi+1 /(xi+1 − xi ) = (q − q −1 )(1 − xix−1                i+1 )
                                                                                                                          −1
                                        gen
is a well defined operator on Mt . Thus the definition of τi makes sense.
     The operator identities xi τi = τi xi+1 xi+1 τi = τi xi , and xj τj = τi xj , if i 6= i, i + 1, now follow
easily from the definition of the τi and the identities in (1.4). These identities imply that τi maps
Mtgen into Msgenit
                   .
     All of the operator identities in part (b) are proved by straightforward calculations of the same
flavour as the calculation of τi τi given below. We shall not give the details for the other cases.
The only one which is really tedious is the calculation for the proof of τi+1 τi τi+1 = τi τi+1 τi . For a
more pleasant (but less elementary) proof of this identity see Proposition 2.7 in [Ra3].
     Since ti 6= ti+1 both τi : Mtgen → Msgen     it

Since the τ -operators satisfy the braid relations the operator τw is independent of the choice of the
reduced word for w. The operator τw is a well defined operator on Mtgen if t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) is such
that ti 6= tj for all pairs i < j such that w(i) > w(j). One may use the relations in (1.5) to rewrite

                                        (q − q −1 )xi+1               (q − q −1 )ti+1

       ti )−1 (ti − ti+1 )−1 mt . Thus

            4. Classification and construction of calibrated representations

     The following theorem classifies and constructs all irreducible calibrated representations of the
affine Hecke algebra H̃n . It shows that the theory of standard Young tableaux plays an intrinsic
role in the combinatorics of the representations of the affine Hecke algebra. The construction given
in Theorem 4.1 is a direct generalization of A. Young’s classical “seminormal construction” of the
irreducible representations of the symmetric group [Y]. Young’s construction was generalized to
Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type A by Hoefsmit [Ho] and Wenzl [Wz] independently, to Iwahori-
Hecke algebras of types B and D by Hoefsmit [Ho] and to cyclotomic Hecke algebras by Ariki
and Koike [AK]. It can be shown that all of these previous generalizations are special cases of the
construction for affine Hecke algebras given here. Recently, this construction has been generalized
even further [Ra3], to affine Hecke algebras of arbitrary Lie type. Some parts of Theorem 4.1 are
due, originally, to I. Cherednik, and are stated in [Ch, §3].
     Garsia and Wachs [GW] showed that the theory of standard Young tableaux and Young’s
constructions play an important role in the combinatorics of the skew representations of the sym-
metric group. At that time it was not known that these representations are actually irreducible as
representations of the affine Hecke algebra!!

Theorem 4.1. Let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape with n boxes. Define an action of H̃n on the
vector space
              H̃ (c,λ/µ) = C−span{vL | L is a standard tableau of shape λ/µ}
by the formulas
                                   xi vL = q 2c(L(i)) vL ,
                                   Ti vL = (Ti )LL vL + (q −1 + (Ti )LL )vsi L ,
where si L is the same as L except that the entries i and i + 1 are interchanged,
                                q − q −1
           (Ti )LL =                                ,    vsi L = 0 if si L is not a standard tableau,
                       1 − q 2(c(L(i))−c(L(i+1)))
and    L(i) denotes the box of L containing the entry i.
(a)    H̃ (c,λ/µ) is a calibrated irreducible H̃n -module.
(b)    The modules H̃ (c,λ/µ) are non-isomorphic.
 (c)   Every irreducible calibrated H̃n -module is isomorphic to H̃ (c,λ/µ) for some placed skew shape
       (c, λ/µ).

step 1. The given formulas for the action of H̃ (c,λ/µ) define an H̃n -module.

Proof. If L is a standard tableau then the entries i and i + 1 cannot appear in the same diagonal
in L. Thus, for all standard tableaux L, c(L(i)) 6= c(L(i + 1)) and for this reason the constant
(Ti )LL is always well defined.
      Let L be a standard tableau of shape λ/µ. Then (Ti )LL + (Ti )si L,si L = q − q −1 and so
          Ti2 vL = ((Ti )2LL + (q −1 + (Ti )LL )(q −1 + (Ti )si L,si L ))vL
                              + (q −1 + (Ti )LL )((Ti )LL + (Ti )si L,si L )vsi L
                = (Ti )LL ((Ti )LL + (Ti )si L,si L )vL + q −1 (q −1 + (Ti )LL + (Ti )si L,si L ))vL
                              + (q −1 + (Ti )LL )(q − q −1 )vsi L
                = (Ti )LL (q − q −1 )vL + (q −1 + (Ti )LL )(q − q −1 )vsi L + q −1 (q −1 + q − q −1 )vL
                = ((q − q −1 )Ti + 1)vL .

The calculations to check the identities (1.1a), (1.1f) and (1.5) are routine. Checking the identity
Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 is more involved. One can proceed as follows. According to the formulas for
the action, the operators Ti and Ti+1 preserve the subspace S spanned by the vectors vQ indexed
by the standard tableaux Q in the set {L, si L, si+1 L, si si+1 L, si+1 si L, si si+1 si L}. Depending on
the relative positions of the boxes containing i, i + 1, i + 2 in L, this space is either 1, 2, 3 or 6
dimensional. Representative cases are when these boxes are positioned in the following ways.

                                                                            q − q 2d12 −1                                    q − q −1      

                                                                              1 − q 2d12                                     1 − q 2d21
where dkℓ = c(L(i + k − 1)) − c(L(i + l − 1)). In each case we compute directly the products
φS (Ti )φS (Ti+1 )φS (Ti ) and φS (Ti+1 )φS (Ti )φS (Ti+1 ) and verify that they are equal. (This proof of
the braid relation is, in all essential aspects, the same as that used by Hoefsmit [Ho], Wenzl [Wz]
and Ariki and Koike [AK]. For a more elegant but less straightforward proof of this relation see
the proof of Theorem 3.1 in [Ra3].)

step 2. The module H̃ (c,λ/µ) is irreducible.

Proof. Let L be a standard tableaux of shape λ/µ and define
                                                  n Y
                                                  Y                 xi − q 2c(P (i))
                                        πL =                                             ,
                                                  i=1 P 6=L
                                                                q 2c(L(i)) − q 2c(P (i))
14                                                      arun ram

where the second product is over all standard tableaux P of shape λ/µ which are not equal to L.
Then πL is an element of H̃n such that

                                                  πL vQ = δLQ vL ,

for all standard tableaux Q of shape λ/µ. This follows from the formula for the action of xi on
H̃ (c,λ/µ) and the fact that the sequence (q 2c(L(1)), . . . , q 2c(L(n)) ) completely determines the standard
tableau L (Lemma 2.2).
      Let N be a nonzero submodule of H̃ (c,λ/µ) and let v = Q aQ vQ be a nonzero element of N .
                                                                        P
Let L be a standard tableau such that the coefficient aL is nonzero. Then πL v = aL vL and so
vL ∈ N .
      By Proposition 2.1 we may identify the set F λ/µ with an interval in Sn (under Bruhat order).
Under this identification the minimal element is the column reading tableau C and there is a chain
C < si1 C < · · · < sip · · · si1 C = L such that all elements of the chain are standard tableaux of
shape λ/µ. Then, by the definition of the τi -operators,

                                                τi1 · · · τip vL = κvC ,

for some constant κ ∈ C∗ . It follows that vC ∈ N .
       Let Q be an arbitrary standard tableau of shape λ/µ. Again, there is a chain C < sj1 C <
· · · < sjp · · · sj1 C = Q of standard tableaux in F λ/µ and we have

                                               τjp · · · τj1 vC = κ′ vQ ,

for some κ′ ∈ C∗ . Thus vQ ∈ N . It follows that N = H̃ (c,λ/µ) . Thus H̃ (c,λ/µ) is irreducible.

step 3. The modules H̃ (c,λ/µ) are nonisomorphic.

Proof. Each of the modules H̃ (c,λ/µ) has a unique basis (up to multiplication of each basis vector
by a constant) of simultaneous eigenvectors for the xi . Each basis vector is determined by its
weight, the sequence of eigenvalues (t1 , . . . , tn ) given by

                                         xi vt = ti vt ,     for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

By the definition of the action of the xi , a weight of H̃ (c,λ/µ) is equal to (q 2c(L(1)), . . . , q 2c(L(n)) )
for some standard tableau L. By Lemma 2.2, both the standard tableau L and the placed skew
shape (c, λ/µ) are determined uniquely by this weight. Thus no two of the modules H̃ (c,λ/µ) can
be isomorphic.


step 4. If t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) is the weight of a calibrated H̃n -module M then t = (q 2c(L(1)) , . . . , q 2c(L(n)) )
for some standard tableau L of placed skew shape.

Proof. Let mt be a weight vector in M of weight t = (t1 , . . . , tn ), i.e.

                                      xi mt = ti mt ,       for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

We want L such that (q 2c(L(1)) , . . . , q 2c(L(n)) ) = (t1 , . . . , tn ). We shall show that if ti = tj for i < j
then there exist k and ℓ such that i < k < ℓ < j, tk = q ±2 ti and tℓ = q ∓2 ti . This will show that
                                   Skew shape representations                                            15

if there are two adjacent boxes of L in the same diagonal then these boxes must be contained in a
complete 2 × 2 block, i.e. if there is a confuguration in L of the form

                   i                                         i k                    i ℓ
                       j       then L must contain           ℓ j            or      k j   .

This is sufficient to guarantee that L is of skew shape.
     Let j > i be such that tj = ti and j − i is minimal. The argument is by induction on the value
of j − i.
Case 1: j − i = 1. Then mt and Ti mt are linearly independent. If they were not we would have
Ti mt = amt which would give

ti amt = xi Ti mt = (Ti xi+1 − (q − q −1 )xi+1 )mt = (ati+1 − (q − q −1 )ti+1 )mt = (a − (q − q −1 ))ti mt .

Since q − q −1 6= 0, this equation implies that ti = 0 which is a contradiction. Now the relations
(1.1d) and (1.4) show that

                                  xi Ti mt = ti (Ti mt − (q − q −1 )mt ),
                               xi+1 Ti mt = ti+1 (Ti mt + (q − q −1 )mt ),
                                 xj Ti mt = tj Ti mt ,     for all j 6= i, i + 1.

It follows that Ti mt is an element of Mtgen but not an element of Mt . This is a contradiction to
the fact that M is calibrated. So this case is not possible, i.e. ti+1 cannot equal ti .
Case 2: j − i = 2. Since ti 6= ti+1 and mt is a weight vector, the vector

                                                    (q − q −1 )ti+1
                                                                   
                                     msi t   = Ti −                   mt
                                                       ti+1 − ti

is a weight vector of weight t′ = si t (see (3.7a)). Then t′i = t′i+1 and so, by Case 1, msi t = 0. This
implies that
                                                (q − q −1 )ti+1
                                       Ti mt =                  mt .
                                                   ti+1 − ti
By equation (1.3), all eigenvalues of Ti are either q or −q −1 . Thus Ti mt = ±q ±1 mt and so
ti = q ±2 ti+1 . A similar argument shows that

                                                      (q − q −1 )ti+2
                                                                     
                                  msi+1 t    = Ti+1 −                   mt
                                                       ti+2 − ti+1

must be 0 and thus that

                                   (q − q −1 )ti+2      (q − q −1 )ti
                       Ti+1 mt =                   mt =               mt = ∓q ∓1 mt .
                                    ti+2 − ti+1          ti − ti+1

From Ti mt = ±q ±1 mt and Ti+1 mt = ∓q ∓1 mt we get

                           ±q ±1 mt = Ti Ti+1 Ti mt = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 mt = ∓q ∓1 mt .
16                                                    arun ram

This is impossible since q is not a root of unity. So this case is not possible, i.e. ti+2 cannot equal
ti .
Induction step. Assume that i and j are such that ti = tj and the value j − i is minimal such that
this is true.
     If tj−1 6= q ±2 tj then the vector

                                                      (q − q −1 )tj
                                                                   
                                       msj t   = Tj −                 mt
                                                       tj−1 − tj

is a weight vector of weight t′ = sj t and by (3.7b) this vector is nonzero. Since t′i = ti = tj = t′j−1
we can apply the induction hypothesis to conclude that there are k and ℓ with i < k < ℓ < j − 1
such that t′k = q ±2 t′i and t′ℓ = q ∓2 t′i . This implies that tk = q ±2 ti and tℓ = q ∓2 ti .
     Similarly, if ti 6= q ±2 ti+1 then the vector

                                                    (q − q −1 )ti+1
                                                                   
                                     msi t   = Ti −                   mt
                                                       ti+1 − ti

is a weight vector of weight t′ = si t and by (3.7b) this vector is nonzero. Since t′i+1 = ti = tj = t′j
we can apply the induction hypothesis to conclude that there are k and ℓ with i + 1 < k < ℓ < j
such that t′k = q ±2 t′j and t′ℓ = q ∓2 t′j . This implies that tk = q ±2 ti and tℓ = q ∓2 ti .
     If we are not in either of the previous cases then ti+1 = q 2 ti or ti+1 = q −2 ti and tj−1 = q 2 tj
or tj−1 = q −2 tj . We cannot have ti+1 = tj−1 since the i and j are such that j − i is minimal such
that ti = tj . Thus q ±2 ti+1 = q ∓2 tj−1 = ti .


step 5. Suppose that M is an irreducible calibrated H̃n -module and that mt is a weight vector in
M with weight t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) such that ti = q ±2 ti+1 . Then τi mt = 0.

Proof. Assume that msi t = τi mt 6= 0. Then, by the second identity in Proposition 3.2 (b),
τi msi t = 0. Since M is irreducible there must be some sequence of τ -operators such that

                                               τi1 . . . τip msi t = κmt ,

with κ ∈ C∗ . Assume that τi1 · · · τip is a minimal length sequence such that this is true. We have
si1 · · · sip si t = t.
       Assume that si1 · · · sip si 6= 1. Then there must be 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n such that ti = tj (because
some nontrivial permutation of the ti fixes t). Since si1 · · · sip si is of minimal length such that it
fixes t it must be a transposition (i, j) for some i < j such that ti = tj . Furthermore there does not
exist i < k < j such that ti = tk . The element si1 · · · sip si switches the ti and the tj in t. In the
process of doing this switch by a sequence of simple transpositions there must be some point where
ti and tj are adjacent and thus there must be some ℓ such that siℓ (siℓ+1 · · · sip si t) = siℓ+1 · · · sip si t.
Then
                                            mt′ = τiℓ+1 · · · τiℓ τi mt
is a nonzero weight vector in M of weight t′ = siℓ+1 · · · sip si t. Since siℓ t′ = t′ it follows that
tiℓ = tiℓ +1 . Since M is calibrated this is a contradiction to (Case 1 of) step 4.
     So si1 · · · sip si = 1. Let k be minimal such that si1 · · · sik is not reduced. Assume p > 1. Then
we can use the braid relations (the third and fourth lines of Proposition 3.2 (b)) to write

                                 κmt = τj1 · · · τjk−2 τik τik τik+1 · · · τip τi mt ,
                                  Skew shape representations                                             17

for some j1 , . . . , jk−2 . Then, by the second line of Proposition 3.2 (b),

                                  κ′ mt = τj1 · · · τjk−2 τik+1 · · · τip τi mt ,

for some κ′ ∈ C∗ . This is a contradiction to the minimality of the length of the sequence τi1 · · · τip .
     So p = 1, ip = i and τi τi mt = κmt . This is a contradiction since the second identity in
Proposition 3.2 (b) and the assumption that ti = q ±2 ti+1 imply that τi τi = 0. So τi mt = 0.


step 6. An irreducible calibrated H̃n -module M is isomorphic to H̃ (c,λ/µ) for some placed skew
shape (c, λ/µ).

Proof. Let mt be a nonzero weight vector in M . Since M is calibrated step 4 implies that
there is a placed skew shape (c, λ/µ) and a standard tableau L of shape λ/µ such that t =
(q 2c(L(1)) , . . . , q 2c(L(n)) ). Let us write mL in place of mt . Let C be the column reading tableau
of shape λ/µ. It follows from Proposition 2.1 that there is a chain C, si1 C, . . . , sip · · · si1 C = L of
standard tableaux of shape λ/µ. By (3.7b), all of the τij in this sequence are bijections and so

                                            mC = τi1 · · · τip mL

is a nonzero weight vector in M . Similarly, if Q is any other standard tableau of shape λ/µ then
there is a chain C, sj1 C, . . . , sjp · · · sj1 C = Q and so

                                            mQ = τjp · · · τj1 mC

is a nonzero weight vector in M . Finally, by step 5, τi mQ = 0 if si Q is not standard (since
q 2c(Q(i)) = q ±2 q 2c(Q(i+1)) ) and so the span of the vectors {mQ | Q a standard tableau of shape λ/µ}
is a submodule of M . Since M is irreducible this must be all of M and the map

                                            M         −→     H̃ (c,λ/µ)
                                          τv mC      7−→       τv vC

is an isomorphism of H̃n -modules.

This completes the proof of Theorem 4.1.


           5. “Garnir relations” and an analogue of Young’s natural basis


    Each of the modules H̃ (c,λ/µ) constructed in Theorem 4.1 has two natural bases:
(a) The “seminormal basis” {vL | L ∈ F λ/µ } which, up to multiplication of each basis vector by
    a constant, is given by
                                             ṽL = τw vC ,                                 (5.1)
    where C is the column reading tableau of shape λ/µ, w is the permutation such that L = wC
    and τw is as in (3.3).
(b) The “natural basis” {nL | L ∈ F λ/µ } given by

                                                    nL = Tw vC ,                                      (5.2)
18                                                  arun ram

     where C is the column reading tableau of shape λ/µ, w is the permutation such that L = wC
     and Tw is as defined in (1.6).

Proposition 5.3. Let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape with n boxes and let H̃ (c,λ/µ) be the
H̃n -module defined in Theorem 4.1. Let C be the column reading tableau of shape λ/µ and let
wC denote the tableau C with the entries permuted according to the permutation w. For each
standard tableau L let nL be defined by formula (5.2). Then {nL | L ∈ F λ/µ } is a basis of H̃ (c,λ/µ) .

Proof. If L is a standard tableau of shape λ/µ let ṽL be as given in (5.1). It follows from the
formulas defining the module H̃ (c,λ/µ) that the basis {ṽL | L ∈ F λ/µ } is simply a renormalized
version of the basis {vL | L ∈ F λ/µ }, i.e there are constants κL ∈ C∗ such that ṽL = κL vL .
     Let si1 · · · sip = w be a reduced word for w. Then, with notations as in Theorem 4.1,

          ṽL = τi1 . . . τip vC = (Ti1 − (Ti1 )L2 L2 )(Ti2 − (Ti1 )L3 L3 ) · · · (Tip − (Tip )Lp Lp )nC ,

where Lj = sij+1 · · · sip C. Expanding this expression yields

                                             X                          X
                              ṽL = (Tw +          bu Tu )nC = nL +          bu nuC ,
                                             u<w                       u<w


for some constants bu ∈ C. The second equality is a consequence of the fact that, by Proposition
2.1, the tableaux uC, u < w, are always standard. Since {ṽL | L ∈ F λ/µ } is a basis it follows from
the triangular relation above that {nL | L ∈ F λ/µ } is also a basis of H̃ (c,λ/µ) .

     The construction of H̃ (c,λ/µ) in Theorem 4.1 makes the notational assumption that vL = 0,
whenever L is not a standard tableau. Formula (5.1) can be used as a definition of ṽL even in the
case when L is not standard and, from the definition of the action in Theorem 4.1,

                                     ṽL = 0,        if L is not standard.                                   (5.4)

Theorem 5.5 proves that these relations, when expanded in terms of the basis {nL | L ∈ F λ/µ } are
exactly the classical Garnir relations!!
     Let λ/µ be a skew shape. A pair of adjacent boxes in the same row of λ/µ determines a snake
in λ/µ consisting of the boxes in the pair, all the boxes above the righthand box of this pair, and
all the boxes below the lefthand box of the pair. See the picture in Theorem 5.5 (b).

Theorem 5.5. (“Garnir relations”) Let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape and let H̃ (c,λ/µ) be
the H̃n -module defined in Theorem 4.1. Let {nL | L ∈ F λ/µ } be the basis of H̃ (c,λ/µ) defined by
Proposition 5.3 and let C be the column reading tableau of shape λ/µ.
 (a) If i and i + 1 are entries in the same column of C then

                                                 Ti nC = −q −1 nC .

(b) Fix a snake in λ/µ. Let P be the standard tableau which has all entries the same as C except
    that the entries in the snake are entered in row reading order instead of in column reading

with coefficients bQ ∈ Z[q, q −1 ]. For notational convenience let us identify each standard tableau
L of shape λ/µ with the permutation w ∈ Sn such that wC = L, where C is the column reading
tableau of shape λ/µ.
     From the definitions
          Td nL = nsd L ,                        if ℓ(sd L) = ℓ(L) + 1 and sd L is standard,
          Td nL = (q − q −1 )nL + nsd L ,        if ℓ(sd L) = ℓ(L) − 1.

Let L be a standard tableau such that ℓ(sd L) = ℓ(L) + 1 and sd L is not standard. The pair of
boxes where the nonstandardness in sd L occurs in either a row or a column:

                        ..
                       ∧
                      f

                    Case (1)                                                Case (2)

Case (1): The two boxes in sd L where the nonstandardness occurs determine a snake in the shape
λ/µ consisting of all the boxes above the entry d and all the boxes below the entry d + 1. Use
the same notation as in Theorem 5.5 so that P is the standard tableau which is the same as the
22                                                    arun ram

column reading tableau C except that the entries in the snake are in row reading order. Then sk P is
nonstandard and there exists a (unique) v ∈ Sn such that sd L = vsk P and ℓ(sd L) = ℓ(v) + ℓ(sk P ).
The permutation v is given by
                                                                                         
                                 i   i + 1 ···       k−1    k   k + 1 k + 2 ···       ℓ
                       v=
                                 a     b   ···        c     d   d+1     e   ···       f

and v(x) = L(x) for all x 6∈ {i, i + 1, . . . , ℓ}. Thus

                                 Td nL = Td TL nC = Tv Tk TP nC = Tv Tk nP .

                  ℓ−i+1
                        
Let ℓ(wA∪B ) =      2       . By Theorem 5.5
                                          X
                              Tk nP = −          (−q)ℓ(wA∪B )−ℓ(wAwB )−ℓ(u) Tu nC ,
                                          u≤P


and so                                                                               
                                             X
                          Td nL = −Tv             (−q)ℓ(wA∪B )−ℓ(wAwB )−ℓ(u) Tu nC  .
                                             u≤P

The permutations v and u ≤ P are such that ℓ(vu) = ℓ(v) + ℓ(u) and so Tv Tu = Tvu for all u ≤ P .
Furthermore, the tableaux vuC, for u ≤ P , are exactly the standard tableaux which are obtained
by permutations of the entries in L which are in the snake. Thus
                                          X
                              Td nL = −          (−q)ℓ(wA∪B )−ℓ(wAwB )−ℓ(u) nvuC .
                                          u≤P


Case (2): Suppose that the boxes containing d and d + 1 in L are the boxes containing k and k + 1
in the column reading tableau C.




                                 C=
                                                 k
                                              k+1




Then Lsk = sd L and

                          Td nL = Td TL nC = TL Tk nC = −q −1 TL nC = −q −1 nL ,

by Theorem 5.5 (a).

(b) Let L be a standard tableau of shape λ/µ and let w be the permutation such that L = wC,
where C is the column reading tableau of shape λ/µ. By repeatedly using the relations (1.4) we
obtain                                                 X

where the pv (x1 , . . . , xn ) are polynomials in x1 , . . . , xn with coefficients in Z[q, q −1 ]. If xi acts on
vC by integral powers of q then we have

                                        6. Induction and restriction


Restriction to Hn . Let Hn be the subalgebra of H̃n generated by T1 , . . . , Tn−1 . The elements
Tw , w ∈ Sn , form a basis of Hn . Since q is not a root of unity the subalgebra Hn of H̃n is
semisimple. The irreducible representations of Hn are indexed by the partitions ν ⊢ n and these
representations are q-analogues of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sn . The
following result describes the decomposition of the restriction to Hn of the irreducible H̃-module
H̃ (c,λ/µ) .

Theorem 6.1. Let H̃ (c,λ/µ) be the irreducible representation of the affine Hecke algebra H̃n which
is defined in Theorem 4.1. Then
                                              H̃n X λ ν
                                   H̃ (c,λ/µ) yHn =    cµν H ,
                                                           ν⊢n

where cλµν is the classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficient and H ν is the irreducible Hn -module
indexed by the partition ν.

Proof. If β = (β1 , . . . , βℓ ) is a composition of n let γβ = γβ1 × · · · × γβℓ ∈ Sβ1 × · · · × Sβℓ where
γr = (1, 2, . . . , r) ∈ Sr (in cycle notation). Let χ(c,λ/µ) (Tγβ ) be the trace of the action of the
element Tγβ ∈ Hn on the H̃n -module H̃ (c,λ/µ) . With notations as in Theorem 4.1
                                                         X
                                       χ(c,λ/µ) (Tγβ ) =
                                                                     
                                                              Tγβ vQ v ,
                                                                         Q
                                                        Q∈F λ/µ

and one can copy (without change) the proof of Theorem 2.20 in [HR2] and obtain
                                X
           χ(c,λ/µ) (Tγβ ) =              ∆(λ(1) /µ)∆(λ(2) /λ(1) ) · · · ∆(λ(ℓ) /λ(ℓ−1) ),
                                 µ⊆λ(1) ⊆···⊆λ(ℓ) =λ

where the sum is over all sequences µ ⊆ λ(1) ⊆ · · · ⊆ λ(ℓ) = λ such that |λ(i) /λ(i−1) | = βi and the
factor ∆(λ(i) /λ(i−1) ) is given by
                                       Y
                     (q − q −1 )cc−1       q c(bs)−1 (−q −1 )r(bs)−1 , if λ/µ is a border strip,
        ∆(λ/µ) =                      bs∈CC
                        0,                                              otherwise.

In the formula for ∆(λ/µ): a border strip is a skew shape with at most one box in each diagonal,
CC is the set of connected components of λ/µ, cc is the number of connected components of λ/µ,
r(bs) is the number of rows of bs, and c(bs) is the number of columns of bs.
     Let sλ denote the Schur function (see [Mac]) and define
                                           r
                                           X

                                          m=1

By Proposition 6.11(a) in [HR1],                        X
                                            q r sµ =        ∆(λ/µ)sλ .
                                                        λ

Letting qβ = qβ1 · · · qβℓ one can inductively apply this formula to obtain
                                                    X
                                         q β sµ =       χ(c,λ/µ) (Tγβ )sλ .
                                                    λ

Thus, with notations as in [Mac] Chapt. I,

                 χ(c,λ/µ) (Tγβ ) = hqβ sµ , sλ i
                                 = hqβ , sλ/µ i,                    by [Mac] I (5.1),
                                   X
                                 =      cλµν hqβ , sν i,             by [Mac] I (5.3),
                                     ν
                                     X
                                 =        cλµν χν (Tγβ ),            by [Ra1] Theorem 4.14,
                                     ν

where χν (Tγβ ) denotes the irreducible character of Hn evaluated at the element Tγβ . The result
follows since, by [Ra1] Theorem 5.1, the characters of Hn are determined by their values on the
elements Tγβ .

Classically, the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients describe
(1) The decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible polynomial representations of
    GLn (C), and
(2) The decomposition of an irreducible representation of Sk × Sℓ when it is induced to Sk+ℓ .
Theorem 6.2 gives an exciting new way of interpreting these coefficients. They describe
(3) The decomposition of an irreducible representation H̃n when it is restricted to the subalgebra
    Hn .

Induction from “Young subalgebras”. Let k and ℓ be such that k + ℓ = n. Let

     H̃k = the subalgebra of H̃n generated by Ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
     H̃ℓ = the subalgebra of H̃n generated by Ti , k + 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and xi , k + 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

In this way H̃k ⊗ H̃ℓ is naturally a subalgebra of H̃n .
     Let (a, θ) be a placed skew shape with k boxes and let (b, φ) be a placed skew shape with ℓ
boxes. Number the boxes of θ with 1, . . . , k (as in Section 2, along diagonals from southwest to
northeast) and number the boxes of φ with k + 1, . . . , n, in order to match the imbeddings of H̃k

and H̃ℓ in H̃n . Let H̃ (a,θ) and H̃ (b,φ) be the corresponding representations of H̃k and H̃ℓ as defined
in Theorem 4.1.
     Let θ ∗v φ (resp. θ ∗h φ) be the skew shape obtained by placing θ and φ adjacent to each other
in such a way that box(k+1) of φ is immediately above (resp. to the left of) boxk of θ. Let a ⊗ b

Theorem 6.2. With notations as above,

Proof. Let Sn /(Sk × Sℓ ) be the set of minimal length coset representatives of the cosets of Sk × Sℓ
in Sn . The module M = IndH̃    n
                              H̃ ⊗H̃
                                     (H̃ (a,θ) ⊗ H̃ (b,φ) ) has basis

                  Tw (vL ⊗ vQ )         where w ∈ Sn /(Sk × Sℓ ), L ∈ F θ and Q ∈ F φ .

By repeatedly applying the relations (1.4) we obtain
                                                                      X
                   xi (Tw (vL ⊗ vQ )) = Tw xw−1 (i) (vL ⊗ vQ ) +           bu Tu (vL ⊗ vQ ),
                                                                     u<w


for some constants bu ∈ C. From this we can see that the action of xi on M is an upper triangular
matrix with eigenvalues q 2c(P (i)) where P runs over the standard tableaux of shapes θ ∗v φ and
θ ∗h φ. It follows that M has
                                      |Sn |Card(F θ )Card(F φ )
                                              |Sk × Sℓ |
distinct weights. Since this number is exactly the dimension of M , it follows that every generalized
weight space of M is one dimensional and thus that M is calibrated. By Theorem 4.1, all irreducible
calibrated representations are of the form H̃ (c,λ/µ) for some placed skew shape (c, λ/µ) and by
Lemma 2.2 this placed skew shape is completely determined by any one of the weights of the module
H̃ (c,λ/µ) . Thus, our analysis of the weights of M implies that both H̃ (a⊗b,θ∗v φ) and H̃ (a⊗b,θ∗h φ)
are composition factors of M . The result follows since

                       dim(H̃ (a⊗b,θ∗v φ) ) + dim(H̃ (a⊗b,θ∗h φ) ) = dim(M ).


    A ribbon is a skew shape which has at most one box in each diagonal.

Corollary 6.3. Let c be the content function given by c(boxi ) = i − 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Let

                                          n
                                                             H̃ (c,λ/µ) ,
                                                       λ/µ


where the sum is over all connected ribbons λ/µ with n boxes.

Proof. Since C[X] = H̃1 ⊗ H̃1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ H̃1 ⊆ H̃n this result can be obtained by repeatedly applying
Theorem 6.2.


Theorem 6.2 and Corollary 6.3 are H̃n -module realizations of the Schur function identities in [Mac]
I §5 Ex 21 (a),(b). The module IndH̃  C[X] (Cvt ) is a principal series module for H̃n (see [Ka]). The
                                        n


identity in Corollary 6.3 describes the composition series of this principal series module. Using the
methods of [Ra3] and [Ra4, (1.2) Ex. 2] one can obtain a generalization of this identity (and thus
of [Mac] I §5 Ex 21 (b)) which holds for affine Hecke algebras of arbitrary Lie type.
