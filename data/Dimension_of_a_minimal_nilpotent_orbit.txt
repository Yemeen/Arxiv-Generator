                                                                         Weiqiang Wang∗


                                                                              Abstract
                                                       We show that the dimension of the minimal nilpotent coad-
                                                   joint orbit for a complex simple Lie algebra is equal to twice the
                                                   dual Coxeter number minus two.

                                                Let g be a finite dimensional complex simple Lie algebra. We fix a
                                             Cartan subalgebra h, a root system ∆ ⊂ h∗ and a set of positive roots
                                             ∆+ ⊂ ∆. Let ρ be half the sum of all positive roots. Denote by θ the
                                             highest root and normalize the Killing form

                                                                           (, ) : g × g → C

                                             by the condition (θ, θ) = 2. The dual Coxeter number h∨ can be defined
                                             as h∨ = (ρ, θ) + 1 (cf. [K]). This intrinsic number of the Lie algebra g
                                             plays an important role in representation theory(cf. e.g. [K]).
                                                 As is well known there exists a unique nonzero nilpotent (co)adjoint
                                             orbit of minimal dimension. A coadjoint orbit can be identified with an
                                             adjoint one by means of the Killing form. For more detail on the nilpo-
                                             tent orbits, we refer to the excellent exposition [CM] and the references
                                             therein. Our result of this short note is the following theorem.

                                             Theorem 1 The dimension of the minimal nonzero nilpotent orbit
                                             equals 2h∨ − 2.

                                                We start with the following well-known lemma, cf. for example,
                                             Lemma 4.3.5, [CM].

                                             Lemma 1 The dimension of the minimal nonzero nilpotent orbit is
                                             equal to one plus the number of positive roots not orthogonal to θ.

    We call a root α in ∆+ special if θ − α is also a root. The subset of
special roots, denoted by S, was singled out in [KW, W] for some other
purposes. It is easy to see that we can also define the set S equivalently
as follows.

Lemma 2 The set S is characterized by the property: rθ (α) = α − θ,
if α ∈ S; rθ (α) = α, if α ∈ ∆+ − (S ∪ {θ}). In other words, S ∪ {θ} is
the set of positive roots not orthogonal to θ.

    The following lemma is taken from [KW, W]. The simple proof
given below follows [W].
Lemma 3 The number of special roots is #S = 2(h∨ − 2).
Proof. Since (θ, θ) = 2 and (ρ, θ) = h∨ − 1, we have
                               2(ρ, θ)
                  rθ ρ = ρ −           θ = ρ − (h∨ − 1)θ.             (1)
                                (θ, θ)
   On the other hand, it follows from Lemma 2 that
                                          
                             1 X 
                 rθ ρ = rθ         α
                             2 α∈∆+
                                                  
                         1 X
                       =           rθ (α) − θ
                         2 θ6=α∈∆+
                                                      
                         1 X
                       =           α − (#S)θ − θ
                         2 θ6=α∈∆+
                                   1
                       = ρ−          (#S + 2) θ.                      (2)
                                   2
Thus this lemma follows by comparing the right hand sides of the
equations (1) and (2).                                        2
   By combining Lemmas 1, 2 and 3, we prove our theorem. We have
an immediate corollary from Lemmas 2 and 3.

Corollary 1 The length of the reflection rθ is l (rθ ) = 2h∨ − 3.
