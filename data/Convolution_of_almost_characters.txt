                                             a connected reductive group over a finite field is given by ”structure constants”
                                             whose leading coefficients can be interpreted in K-theoretic terms and in particular
                                             are natural numbers. A conjectural analogue for character sheaves is also stated.
                                             1. Let G be a finite group. Let VecG be the category whose objects are C-vector
                                             bundles on G which are G-equivariant for the conjugation action of G on G. For U ∈
                                             VecG let Ug denote the fibre of U at g ∈ G; the G-equivariant structure on U is given
                                             by isomorphisms ψxU : Uy −  → Uxyx−1 for any x, y ∈ G. For U, U ′ ∈ VecG we define
                                             U ∗ U ′ ∈ VecG as follows: for y ∈ G, we have (U ∗ U ′ )y = ⊕(g,g ′ )∈G×G;gg ′ =y Ug ⊗ Ug′ ′ ;
                                             the G-equivariant structure on U ∗ U ′ is defined by
                                                           ′
                                                     ψxU∗U : ⊕(g,g ′ )∈G×G;gg ′ =y Ug ⊗ Ug′ ′ −
                                                                                              → ⊕(h,h′ )∈G×G;hh′ =xyx−1 Uh ⊗ Uh′ ′
                                                                                                                              ′
                                             given by the direct sum over {(g, g ′) ∈ G × G; gg ′ = y} of ψxU ⊗ ψxU : Ug ⊗ Ug′ ′ −
                                                                                                                                 →
                                                        ′
                                             Uxgx−1 ⊗ Uxg ′ x−1 . Then VecG becomes a tensor category. In [L5, p.242] it is shown
                                             that U ∗ U ′ is isomorphic to U ′ ∗ U for any U, U ′ ∈ VecG . More directly, for any
                                             y ∈ G we define an isomorphism

                                                          πy : ⊕(g,g ′ )∈G×G;gg ′ =y Ug ⊗ Ug′ ′ −
                                                                                                → ⊕(h,h′ )∈G×G;hh′ =y Uh′ ⊗ Uh′
                                                                      ′
                                             by πy (u ⊗ u′ ) = ψgU (u′ ) ⊗ u ∈ Ugg        ′                                 ′     ′
                                                                                            ′ g −1 ⊗ Ug (where u ∈ Ug , u ∈ Ug ′ ).     Then
                                                                      ′      ′
                                             π = (πy )y∈G : U ∗ U −     → U ∗ U is an isomorphism of G-equivariant vector bundles.
                                                Let M(G) be the set of pairs (g, ρ) where g ∈ G is defined up to G-conjugacy
                                             and ρ is an irreducible representation of the centralizer ZG (g) defined up to iso-
                                             morphism. As in [L1] we have a pairing {, } : M(G) × M(G) −               → C given by
                                                                                                     X
                                             {(g, ρ), (g ′, ρ′ )} = |ZG (g)|−1 |ZG (g ′ )|−1                  tr(hg ′ h−1 , ρ)tr(h−1 g −1 h, ρ′ ).
                                                                                           h∈G;h−1 gh∈ZG (g ′ )

                                             An object in VecG is said to be irreducible if it is non-zero and is not a direct sum
                                             of two non-zero objects of VecG . According to [L5,2.5], the set of isomorphism

                                                                                             1

classes of irreducible objects of VecG is in natural bijection with the set M(G): to
m = (g, ρ) ∈ M(G) corresponds an object U = U m ∈ VecG such that Uh is zero
for h ∈ G not conjugate to g and tr(ψxU : Ug −  → Ug ) = tr(x, ρ) for any x ∈ ZG (g).
          m
Then (U )m∈M(G) is a Z-basis for the Grothendieck group KG (G) of VecG . For
m, m′ in M(G), we can write
                              ′                  ′′
                       Um ∗ Um ∼= ⊕m′′ ∈M(G) (U m )⊕pm,m′ ,m′′

where pm,m′ ,m′′ ∈ N are multiplicities. Now ∗ induces a structure of commutative
ring on KG (G) in which pm,m′ ,m′′ are structure constants:
                                        X
(a)                       Um Um ′ =               pm,m′ ,m′′ Um′′ .
                                      m′′ ∈M(G)


According to [L5, 2.5(d)] for any (z, η) ∈ M(G), the assignment

                          U m 7→ (dim η)−1 |ZG (z)|{m, (z, η)}

defines a ring homomorphism KG (G) −
                                   → C. Applying this ring homomorphism to
(a) gives
                                                        X
      (dim η)−1 |ZG (z)|{m, (z, η)}{m′ , (z, η)} =               pm,m′ ,m′′ {m′′ , (z, η)}.
                                                     m′′ ∈M(G)


Since the matrix ({m, m′ }) has square 1 (see [L1]) we deduce that
                       X
(b)    pm,m,m′′ =             (dim η)−1 |ZG (z)|{m, (z, η)}{m′ , (z, η)}{(z, η), m′′ }.
                    (z,η)∈M(G)


2. Let Γ be a finite group and let f, f ′ be two class functions Γ −     → C. Recall
                              ′
that
P     the  convolution  f ∗ f   is the class function Γ −→    C given by (f ∗ f ′ )(γ) =
                ′ −1                                                                 ′
  γ1 ∈Γ f (γ1 )f (γ1 γ). It is well known that given irreducible characters f, f of
Γ, we have f ∗ f ′ = 0 if f 6= f ′ and f ∗ f = (|Γ|/f (1))f .
3. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraic closure of a
finite field Fq , with a fixed Fq -rational structure. The vector space of class func-
tions G(Fq ) −→ C has an orthonormal basis consisting of the irreducible characters
and also an orthonormal basis consisting of ”almost characters” (see [L2, 13.6]),
closely related to character sheaves. We would like to study the convolution of two
almost characters. Since the basis of almost characters differs from the basis of
irreducible characters by an explicitly known almost diagonal matrix, we see that
the convolution of two almost characters is a linear combination of a small num-
ber of almost characters. We want to make explicit the coefficients in this linear

combination. For simplicity, here we restrict ourselves to ”unipotent almost char-
acters”; these are the almost characters that are linear combinations of unipotent
characters (they form a basis of the space spanned by the unipotent characters).
We also assume that G is split over Fq and that G modulo its centre is simple.
   To each two sided cell c of the Weyl group W of G we attach as in [L2, §4] a
certain finite group Gc . As in [L2] the set of unipotent characters (resp. unipotent
almost characters) of GF can be indexed as (σc,m ) (resp. (σ̂c,m )) where c is a two
sided cell of W , m ∈ M(Gc ) and
                                        X
(a)                        σ̂c,m =              {m′ , m}∆(c, m′ )σc,m′
                                     m′ ∈M(Gc )


                                        X
(b)                        σc,m =                 {m′ , m}∆(c, m)σ̂c,m′
                                     m′ ∈M(Gc )


with ∆(c, m′ ) = ±1. Moreover, to any two-sided cell c one can attach an integer
Ac ≥ 0 such that for any m = (g, ρ) ∈ Gc , |G(Fq )|/σc,m (1) is a polynomial in q
with constant rational coefficients of the form
                            |ZGc (g)| D−A
(c)                                  q    c
                                            + lower powers of q.
                             dim ρ

(Here D = dim G.)
   We now consider two unipotent almost characters σ̂c,m , σ̂c′ ,m′ . From (a) we see
that
   σ̂c,m ∗ σ̂c′ ,m′ = 0 if c 6= c′ .
Now assume that c = c′ . From (a),(b) we have

         σ̂c,m ∗ σ̂c,m′
                   X
          =                    {m1 , m}{m2 , m′ }∆(c, m1 )∆(c, m2 )σc,m1 ∗ σc,m2
              m1 ,m2 ∈M(Gc )
                 X
          =               {m1 , m}{m1 , m′ }|G(Fq )|σc,m1 (1)−1 σc,m1
              m1 ∈M(Gc )
                 X
          =               {m1 , m}{m1 , m′ }|G(Fq )|σc,m1 (1)−1
              m1 ∈M(Gc )
              X
                     {m′′ , m1 }∆(c, m1 )σ̂c,m′′ .
          m′′ ∈M(Gc )


Thus                                              X
                          σ̂c,m ∗ σ̂c,m′ =                 Nm,m′ ,m′′ σ̂c,m′′
                                             m′1 ∈M(Gc )
4                                           G. LUSZTIG

where, for m, m′ , m′′ ∈ M(Gc ) we have
                      X
    Nm,m′ ,m′′ =             {m1 , m}{m1 , m′ }{m′′ , m1 }∆(c, m1 )|G(Fq )|σc,m1 (1)−1 .
                   m1 ∈M(Gc )


Using (c) we see that Nm,m′ ,m′′ is a polynomial in q with constant rational coeffi-
cients of the form
                      nm,m′ ,m′′ q D−Ac + lower powers of q

where

                       X          |ZGc (z)|
    nm,m′ ,m′′ =                            ∆(c, (z, η)){(z, η), m}{(z, η), m′}{m′′ , (z, η)}.
                                   dim η
                   (z,η)∈M(Gc )


If ∆(c, m1 ) is 1 for any m1 ∈ M(Gc ) then, using 1(b) and the identity {m1 , m2 } =
{m2 , m1 }, we see that
                               nm,m′ ,m′′ = pm,m′ ,m′′

where pm,m′ ,m′′ is defined as in Section 1 in terms of G = Gc . (We use that the
integer pm,m′ ,m′′ is fixed by complex conjugation.) Thus, the leading coefficient
nm,m′ ,m′′ has a K-theoretic interpretation; in particular, it is in N.
   A similar result holds when m1 7→ ∆(c, m1 ) is not identically 1. (Then G
is of type E7 and c is a two-sided cell with |c| = 2 × 5122 or G is of type E8
and c is a two-sided cell with |c| = 2 × 40962 .) In this case Gc = Z/2Z, MGc
may be identified with the (additive) abelian group Z/2Z × Hom(Z/2Z, C∗ ) and
∆(c, m1 ) = 2{m0 , m1 } where m0 = (0, ǫ) and ǫ 6= 0. Moreover, in this case we
have {m1 , m2 }{m1 , m3 } = {m1 , m2 + m3 }/2 and {m1 , m2 } = {m2 , m1 }. It follows
that                             X
                 nm,m′ ,m′′ =         {m1 , m + m′ + m′′ + m0 }/2.
                                    m1 ∈M(Gc )

On the other hand we have
                                          X
                       pm,m′ ,m′′ =              {m1 , m + m′ + m′′ }/2.
                                       m1 ∈M(Gc )


Hence
             nm,m′ ,m′′ = pm+m0 ,m′ ,m′′ = pm,m′ +m0 ,m′′ = pm,m′ ,m′′ +m0 .

Remark. If G is a classical group, then for any c, M(GU ) may be regarded as an F2 -
vector space of even dimension and for m, m′ , m′′ in M(GU ) we have nm,m′ ,m′′ =
pm,m′ ,m′′ = 1 if m+m′ +m′′ = 0 and nm,m′ ,m′′ = pm,m′ ,m′′ = 0 if m+m′ +m′′ 6= 0.

4. Under some mild restriction on the characteristic of Fq , the ”unipotent” char-
acter sheaves on G can again be indexed as (Kc,m )) where c is a two sided cell of
W and m ∈ M(Gc ) (see [L3]). For c as above, let Cc be the category whose objects
are perverse sheaves which are direct sums of character sheaves of the form Kc,m
for various m ∈ M(Gc ). Let µ : G × G −      → G be multiplication. For K, K ′ ∈ Cc
we set K ◦ K ′ = p H 2D−2Ac (µ! (K ⊠ K ′ )) (notation of Section 3; p H i () denotes the
i-th perverse cohomology sheaf).
   We conjecture that K ◦ K ′ ∈ Cc and that K, K ′ 7→ K ◦ K ′ defines on Cc a
structure of tensor category; moreover, this tensor category should be equivalent
to VecGc . In particular, for m, m′ ∈ M(Gc ), we should have

                                                      ⊕p
                         Kc,m ◦ Kc,m′ ∼

   This conjecture is suggested by the results in Section 3. We expect that it
extends also to the non-unipotent case and that its proof should involve the geo-
metric interpretation of the indexing of the character sheaves in Cc by irreducible
vector bundles in VecGc indicated in [L4, 4.7(a)].
