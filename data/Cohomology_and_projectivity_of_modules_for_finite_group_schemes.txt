                                                                               1. Introduction
                                                Let G be a finite group scheme over a field k, that is, an affine group scheme whose
                                             coordinate ring k[G] is finite dimensional. The dual algebra k[G]∗ ≡ Homk (k[G], k) is
                                             then a finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra. Indeed, there is an equivalence
                                             of categories between finite group schemes and finite dimensional cocommutative
                                             Hopf algebras (cf. [19]). Further the representation theory of G is equivalent to that
                                             of k[G]∗ . Many familiar objects can be considered in this context. For example,
                                             any finite group G can be considered as a finite group scheme. In this case, the
                                             algebra k[G]∗ is simply the group algebra kG. Over a field of characteristic p >
                                             0, the restricted enveloping algebra u(g) of a p-restricted Lie algebra g is a finite
                                             dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra. Also, the mod-p Steenrod algebra is graded
                                             cocommutative so that some finite dimensional Hopf subalgebras are such algebras.
                                                Over the past thirty years, there has been extensive study of the modular repre-
                                             sentation theory (i.e., over a field of positive characteristic p > 0) of such algebras,
                                             particularly in regards to understanding cohomology and determining projectivity of
                                             modules. This paper is primarily interested in the following two questions:
                                             Questions 1.1. Let G be a finite group scheme G over a field k of characteristic
                                             p > 0, and let M be a rational G-module.
                                              (a) Does there exist a family of subgroup schemes of G which detects whether M is
                                                  projective?
                                              (b) Does there exist a family of subgroup schemes of G which detects whether a
                                                  cohomology class z ∈ ExtnG (M, M) (for M finite dimensional) is nilpotent?
                                             It is shown here that when the connected component of G is unipotent there is a family
                                             of subgroup schemes (with simple structure) that provides an affirmative answer to
                                             both questions. These are referred to as elementary group schemes.
                                             Definition 1.2. Given a field k of characteristic p > 0 and a pair of non-negative
                                             integers r and s, define the elementary group scheme Er,s to be the product Ga(r) × Es
                                             over k, where Ga(r) denotes the rth Frobenius kernel of the additive group scheme
                                             Ga , and Es is an elementary abelian p-group of rank s (considered as a finite group
                                             scheme). The groups Ga(0) and E0 are identified with the trivial group.
                                             The precise statements of the main results are Theorems 6.1 and 8.1. Some related
                                             detection results are deduced in Sections 7 and 8 as well.

   This work has its roots in work on finite groups by J.-P. Serre [28], D. Quillen
[24], L. Chouinard [8], J. Alperin and L. Evens [1], G. Avrunin and L. Scott [2], and
J. Carlson [7] among others. For a finite group, the family of elementary abelian
subgroups detects projectivity and nilpotence. Specifically, we remind the reader of
two fundamental theorems which provide a model for other results.
Theorem 1.3 (Chouinard [8]). Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite
group, and M be a kG-module. Then M is projective as a kG-module if and only if
it is projective as a kE-module for every elementary abelian subgroup E ⊂ G.

Theorem 1.4 (Quillen [24], Carlson [7]). Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G
be a finite group, and M be a finite dimensional kG-module. Then an element z ∈
Ext∗kG (M, M) is nilpotent if and only if the image of z under the the natural restriction
map Ext∗kG (M, M) → Ext∗kE (M, M) is nilpotent for every elementary abelian subgroup
E ⊂ G.
   More recent forerunners of this work are the analogous results which have been
obtained for restricted Lie algebras or more generally for infinitesimal group schemes.
An infinitesimal group scheme H is one for which the coordinate algebra k[H] is
finite dimensional and local. One of the most important examples of such is the set
of Frobenius kernels {G(r) } of an affine group scheme G, where G(r) is the kernel of
the rth iterate of the Frobenius map on G. Any restricted Lie algebra g corresponds
to a certain group scheme G(1) , the first Frobenius kernel of some affine group scheme
(cf. [19]). In work of E. Friedlander, A. Sulin, and the author [30], [3], it was shown
that the family of subgroup schemes {Ga(r) } plays the role of elementary abelian
subgroups in detecting projectivity and nilpotence of cohomology for infinitesimal
group schemes. Specifically, Theorems 2.5 and 4.1 of [30] are analogues of Theorem 1.4
for detecting nilpotent cohomology classes, and Proposition 7.6 of [30] is an analogue
of Chouinard’s theorem (Theorem 1.3) about detecting projectivity. However, the
latter result holds only for finite dimensional modules, whereas Chouinard’s theorem
holds for arbitrary modules. In [3], ideas based on Chouinard’s original arguments
were used to show that the family of subgroup schemes {Ga(r) } does detect projectivity
of arbitrary modules for infinitesimal unipotent group schemes. It remains an open
problem to show this for arbitrary infinitesimal group schemes.
   Given the results for finite groups and infinitesimal group schemes, one is naturally
led to ask the questions in 1.1. In other words, is there a “nice” general family of
subgroup schemes which detects projectivity and nilpotence?
   The search for an answer begins by noticing a similarity between the fundamen-
tally different notions of an elmentary abelian p-group Er of rank r and the Frobe-
nius kernel Ga(r) . Indeed, their corresponding Hopf algebras k[Er ]∗ = kEr and
k[Ga(r) ]∗ are both isomorphic as algebras to a truncated polynomial algebra Ar =
k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xr ]/(xp1 , xp2 , . . . , xpr ) (although their coalgebra structures differ). This sug-
gests considering a general family of group schemes whose coordinate algebras have
such structure, and leads to the above definition (1.2) of elementary group schemes.
   It is shown here that for finite group schemes whose (infinitesimal) connected com-
ponent at the identity, G0 , is unipotent the family of elementary group schemes
{Er,s }r≥0,s≥0 plays the general role of elementary abelian groups. More precisely,

the first main result of this paper, Theorem 6.1, is a generalization of Theorem 1.4
above and Theorem 2.5 of [30] on detecting nilpotent cohomology classes. And the
second main result, Theorem 8.1, is a generalization of Theorem 1.3 above and the
Theorem of [3] on detecting projectivity of modules.
   A group scheme G is unipotent if it admits an embedding as a closed subgroup of Un
for some n, where Un is the subgroup of invertible strictly upper triangular matrices
in GLn (the group scheme of all invertible n × n matrices). Unipotent groups are
generalizations of p-groups in that they admit only a single simple module, the trivial
module k. (Indeed, that is sometimes taken as the definition of a unipotent group
scheme. And if the reader prefers a Hopf algebra perspective, then unipotent means
that we are considering Hopf algebras which admit a single simple module.)
   The connected component of G comes into play via a decomposition of a finite
group scheme into an infinitesimal part and a finite group part. More precisely, if G
is a finite group scheme over k and all of its points are k-rational, then G may be
identified as a semi-direct product G = G0 ⋊ π, where π = G(k) is the finite group of
k-points of G which acts on G0 via group scheme automorphisms (cf. [17], [31]). In
the proofs of the main results, a certain injection in cohomology (Lemma 5.4) leads
to an easy reduction to the case that π is a p-group. When π is a p-group and G0 is
unipotent, the group G is unipotent.
   Unipotent groups have other nice properties which will also be reviewed in Sec-
tion 5. Prior to that, some necessary cohomological properties of elementary group
schemes are developed in Sections 2 and 3, with the key result being Proposition
3.6. This is a characterization of the cohomology of elementary group schemes that
generalizes Serre’s characterization of the cohomology of elementary abelian groups
(cf. Proposition 3.4). The proofs of the main results, rely on homomorphisms of
the form G ։ Ga(1) and G ։ Z/p. Some cohomological properties related to such
homomorphisms are also developed in Sections 4 and 5.
   Theorem 6.1 (whose statement and proof make up the content of Section 6) has
several almost immediate consequences which are presented in Section 7. One of
these, Corollary 7.2, is a generalization of Theorem 1.3 about detecting projectivity
of finite dimensional modules. Indeed, for finite dimensional modules, Chouinard’s
theorem (Theorem 1.3) follows via a general argument from Theorem 1.4. The key
fact is that for a finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra A over k and a finite
dimensional A-module M, Ext∗A (M, M) is finitely generated as a module over (the
Noetherian ring) H ∗ (A, k) = Ext∗A (k, k) (cf. [17]). The bulk of Section 8 consists
of the proof of Theorem 8.1 which gives the detection of projectivity for arbitrary
modules. In the final result of the paper (Corollary 8.6), Dade’s lemma [11] is used
to derive an alternate detection result.
   Having outlined the contents of the paper, we note some additional motivation for
answering the questions in 1.1. First, Theorem 1.4 is a key component in identifying
the cohomological support varieties of finite groups. For any finite dimensional cocom-
mutative Hopf algebra A over a field k, the cohomology ring H ∗ (A, k) = Ext∗A (k, k)
is graded commutative so that the even dimensional portion H 2∗ (A, k) is a commu-
tative ring. The cohomological variety (or properly scheme) of A is defined to be the
prime ideal spectrum Spec H 2∗ (A, k). Further, for any finite dimensional A-module

M, consider the kernel JA (M) of the map
                                                ⊗M
                                 Ext2∗
                                    A (k, k) −−→ Ext∗A (M, M).
This is a homogeneous ideal which defines a homogeneous subscheme of Spec H 2∗ (A, k)
called the support variety of M. These definitions were originally made in terms of the
maximal ideal spectrum (over algebraically closed fields) in which case they are hon-
est varieties. Within the literature, it has been noted that it is often more convenient
to work instead with prime ideals, while maintaining the traditional terminology.
   This study of cohomology via varieties was extended to restricted Lie algebras by
E. Friedlander and B. Parshall [15], [16], as well as by J. Jantzen [20], and later to
arbitrary infinitesimal group schemes by E. Friedlander, A. Suslin, and the author
[29, 30]. In that work, the detection properties of the family of subgroup schemes
{Ga(r) } was crucial for identifying the varieties. This suggests that a substantial
theory of cohomological varieties for arbitrary finite group schemes requires a family
of subgroup schemes (with simple cohomological structure) which detects nilpotence.
   Further, D. Benson, J. Carlson, and J. Rickard [5, 6] have recently developed a
theory of varieties for arbitrary modules (i.e., including infinite dimensional mod-
ules) which seems to be fruitful for studying finite dimensional modules. A family
of subgroup schemes which detects both nilpotence in cohomology and projectivity
of arbitrary modules is important for an attempt to extend these ideas to more gen-
eral finite group schemes or Hopf algebras, because some of their results depend on
knowing that Theorem 1.3 holds for arbitrary modules. Indeed, the recent work of
M. Hovey and J. Palmieri [18] extends the definitions of these varieties to some more
general finite dimensional graded cocommutative Hopf algebras.
   While the work here is from a group scheme perspective, these results could also
be stated in terms of finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebras. From the
latter perspective, the results say that nilpotence in cohomology and projectivity
of modules can be detected by certain elementary Hopf subalgebras, that is, Hopf
subalgebras which have the algebra structure of a truncated polynomial algebra
k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]/(xp1 , xp2 , . . . , xpn ). We leave the precise formulations to the interested
reader, but point out that others have studied these questions from a Hopf algebra
perspective, in fact, from the more general perspective of graded Hopf algebras.
   A few examples are work of C. Wilkerson [32], J. Palmieri [26], D. Nakano and
J. Palmieri [23], and M. Hovey and J. Palmieri [18]. The motivation for considering
graded algebras comes from topological interests in the Steenrod algebra which is
graded. While any Hopf algebra can be trivially graded (by concentrating the algebra
in degree 0), a generic graded Hopf algebra may only be graded cocommutative and not
honestly cocommutative. Such algebras do not correspond to finite group schemes
and are not in our realm of consideration. Even if one ignores the grading, one
must be careful about issues of whether modules and subalgebras are graded or not.
For example, working over graded Hopf algebras, C. Wilkerson [32] showed that
elementary Hopf subalgebras did not necessarily detect nilpotence in the cohomology
ring of the restricted enveloping algebra of a restricted Lie algebra. However, his
example does not contradict our results because his example is for a graded Lie
algebra and he only considers graded subalgebras, while Theorem 6.1 would require
looking at a larger family of elementary subalgebras.

   Wilkerson’s work led to the more general notion of quasi-elementary Hopf algebras.
This family of Hopf algebras was used successfully by J. Palmieri [26] to obtain an
analogue of Theorem 1.4 and many other results in work with D. Nakano [23] and
M. Hovey [18] for graded (connected) finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf alge-
bras. While some of these results would apply to our situation, they remain somewhat
unsatisfying because, while quasi-elementary Hopf algebras can be defined cohomo-
logically, they have only been concretely described in some cases. For a group algebra,
they simply correspond to elementary abelian groups. For a finite dimensional Hopf
subalgebra of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, which is honestly cocommutative, the
quasi-elementary subalgebras are in fact elementary. In that case, Theorem 6.1 is
consistent with [26] in claiming that nilpotence can be detected by elementary Hopf
subalgebras.

                 2. Cohomology of Elementary Group Schemes
   For the remainder of the paper, k will denote a field of characteristic p > 0 and
group schemes will be defined over k (unless otherwise specified). As group schemes
of the form Er,s = Ga(r) × Es will play a prominent role in the sequel, we make note
of the structure of their cohomology rings. Of course we have
                            H ∗ (Er,s, k) = H ∗ (Ga(r) , k) ⊗ H ∗ (Es , k).
And the cohomology of both Ga(r) and Es are well known, the first via [10] and
the second is a classical result (see for example [4] or [13]). Indeed, their algebra
structures are identical when r = s, yet it will be important to distinguish the two
pieces, and so we use different notation.
Proposition 2.1. If p 6= 2, then H ∗ (Ga(r) , k) = k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xr ] ⊗ Λ(λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λr )
and H ∗ (Es , k) = k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] ⊗ Λ(y1 , y2 , . . . , ys ), where the xi and zi have degree
2 and the λi and yi have degree 1. If p = 2, then we simply have H ∗ (Ga(r) , k) =
k[λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λr ] and H ∗ (Es , k) = k[y1 , y2, . . . , ys ] with λi and yi again having degree
1. In the latter case, we set xi = λ2i and zi = yi2 for each i.
   The cohomology ring of any finite-dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra ad-
mits the action of Steenrod operations βP i and P i (or Sq i ) (cf. [22]). Of essential
importance for our proofs will be the action of the Steenrod operations on H ∗ (Er,s , k).
We summarize in the following Lemma the actions on the above generators, and note
that the actions differ somewhat on the two pieces. The action on the Es generators
is well known (cf. [4], [22]). For Ga(r) we refer the reader to [30, Prop. 1.7]. Indeed,
in the case of finite groups, the operation βP i is simply the composition of P i with
the Bockstein homomorphism β.
Lemma 2.2. Let r and s be non-negative integers. The action of the Steenrod oper-
ations on the generators of H ∗ (Er,s, k) as given in Proposition 2.1 are as follows:

                                      3. Serre’s Theorem
  An essential ingredient in proving both Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 is Serre’s cohomo-
logical characterization of elementary abelian p-groups:
Theorem 3.1 (Serre [28]). Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0 and G be a finite
p-group. If G is not elementary abelian, then there exists a finite
                                                                  Q family of 2non-zero
                                 1
elements v1 , v2 , . . . , vm ∈ H (G, k) such that the element u = β(vi ) ∈ H (G, k) is
zero, where β denotes the Bockstein homomorphism.
   For our purposes it is more useful to work with a “dual” statement about the
cohomology of elementary abelian groups. We present this in Proposition 3.4 followed
by an analogue and a generalization. The proof of Proposition 3.4 is essentially
contained in Serre’s original proof of Theorem 3.1 (which was stated for the finite
field k = Fp ). Throughout this section we use the notation of Proposition 2.1. The
following fact is a special case of the Corollaire to Proposition (1) of [28].
Proposition 3.2 (Serre [28]). Let s be a positive integer and I ⊂ Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] ⊂
H ∗ (Es , Fp ) be a non-zero homogeneous ideal in Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] which is stable un-
der the Steenrod operations. Then there exists a finite family {ui } of elements in
Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ],Qeach of which is a non-zero linear combination of the {zj }, such
that the product ui ∈ Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] lies in I.

     PLet Ai = Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] and
Proof.                                          consider the operation θ : A → A defined by
θ= ∞   i=0 P  (or the  sum    of   the    Sq i
                                               in  the case p = 2). It follows from the Cartan

formula, P (u · v) =       n=0 P (u) · P             (v), that θ is an algebra homomorphism.
Moreover, from Lemma 2.2, it is the algebra homomorphism defined by θ(zi ) = zi +zip
for each i. Finally, since I is stable under the Steenrod operations, it is stable under
θ, and so the claim follows from the Corollaire to Proposition (1) of [28].
   The following lemma allows us to extend from the finite field Fp to an arbitrary
field k of characteristic p > 0.
Lemma 3.3. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0 and s be a positive integer. If I ⊂
k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] ⊂ H ∗ (Es , k) is a non-zero homogeneous ideal in k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] which

is stable under the Steenrod operations, then I ′ = I ∩Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] is also non-zero,
where the algebra Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] is naturally embedded in the algebra k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ].
Proof. Let
                                             n
                                                        j     j
                                             X
                                       f=          ai z1i,1 z2i,2 · · · zsji,s
                                             i=1
be a non-zero homogeneous polynomial in I. Choose such an f that has lowest
possible degree and for which the number of summands, n, is least. Having made
such a choice, it suffices to assume that a1 = 1. From Lemma 2.2 and the Cartan
formula (P 0 (u · v) = P 0 (u) · P 0 (u)), we see that
                                           n
                                                   j     j
                                          X

                               P (f ) =       api z1i,1 z2i,2 · · · zsji,s .
                                               i=1
Since a1 = 1, the difference
                                              n
                                                                    j     j
                                              X
                               0
                             P (f ) − f =            (api − ai )z1i,1 z2i,2 · · · zsji,s
                                               i=2

has fewer summands than f . By assumption P 0 (f ) and hence P 0 (f ) − f also lie in
I. By the minimality of f , P 0 (f ) − f must be zero. That is, we must have api = ai
for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In other words, f lies in the subalgebra Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] and so
the ideal I ′ is non-zero.

Proposition 3.4 (Serre [28]). Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, s be a positive
integer, and I ⊂ H ∗ (Es , k) be a homogeneous ideal which is stable under the Steenrod
operations. If I contains a non-zero element of degree two, then there exists a finite
family {ui } of elements in H 2 (Es , Q
                                      k), each of which is a non-zero linear combination
of the {zj }, such that the product ui ∈ H ∗ (Es , k) lies in I.
Proof. We have H ∗ (Es , k) = k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] ⊗ Λ(y1 , y2 , . . . , ys ). Consider the set I ′ =
I ∩ k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] ⊂ k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ]. This is evidently an ideal in k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ]
and moreover homogeneous since I was. If I ′ is non-zero, by Lemma 3.3, the ideal
I ′′ = I ∩ Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] ⊂ Fp [z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] is also non-zero as well as homogeneous
and Steenrod      P stable. ApplyingP        Proposition 3.2 to I ′′ , the result follows.
    Let z = 1≤i<j≤s ai,j yi yj + 1≤ℓ≤s bℓ zℓ with ai,j , bℓ ∈ k be a non-zero degree two
element in I. If each ai,j = 0, then z is an element of the desired form and we’re
done. If not, as in the proof of Proposition (4) of [28], apply the operation βP 1 βP 0
(or Sq 1 Sq 2 Sq 1 in the case p = 2) to z. From the Cartan formula and Lemma 2.2,
                                            2
we have βP 1 βP 0 (z) = i<j api,j (zip zj − zi zjp ), which is non-zero. Clearly this lies in
                                  P

k[z1 , z2 , . . . , zs ] and by the stability assumption it lies in I and hence in I ′ .
  In the case of infinitesimal group schemes, there is a similar sort of result which
was used in [30]. For the reader’s convenience, we restate it here.
Proposition 3.5 (Proposition 1.7 of [30]). Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, r
be a positive integer, and I ⊂ H ∗ (Ga(r) , k) be a k-submodule stable with respect to the
Steenrod operations. If I contains a non-zero element of degree two, then some power
of xr lies in I.
8                                   CHRISTOPHER P. BENDEL

    We now combine these into a statement about Er,s = Ga(r) × Es .
Proposition 3.6. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, r and s be non-negative
integers, and I ⊂ H ∗ (Er,s , k) be a homogeneous ideal which is stable under the Steenrod
operations. If I contains a non-zero element of degree two, then there exists an integer
m and a finite family {ui } of elements in H 2 (Es , k) ⊂ H 2 (Er,s , k), Q
                                                                          each of which is a
                                                                       m
non-zero linear combination of the {zj }, such that the product xr          ui ∈ H ∗(Er,s , k)
lies in I.
Proof. Consider the ideals I1 = I ∩ H ∗ (Es , k) and I2 = I ∩ H ∗ (Ga(r) , k). These
ideals satisfy the structural hypotheses of Propositions 3.4 and 3.5 respectively. By
assumption I contains some non-zero element u of degree 2. Generically, u has the
following form:
         X                  X           X                   X                X
   u=          ai,j λi λj +    bj xj +         ci,j λi yj +     di,j yi yj +    ej zj
        1≤i<j≤r            1≤j≤r         1≤i≤r,1≤j≤s                   1≤i<j≤s     1≤j≤s

for some constants ai,j , bj , ci,j , di,j , ej ∈ k which are not all zero.
   We remind the reader of Lemma 2.2 which lists the actions of the Steenrod oper-
ations on the generators. We consider the case that p > 2 and simply make note of
the appropriate operations in the case p = 2. The interested reader may fill in the
details of the latter case. From Lemma 2.2(b) and the Cartan formula:
                                             ℓ
                                             X
                             P ℓ (v · w) =         P n (v) · P ℓ−n (w),
                                             n=0

we first observe that repeated application of P 0 (resp. Sq 0 ) to u results in an element
                          ℓ       P ℓ
of the form u′ = i<j dpi,j yi yj + j epj zj since the other terms are eventually killed by
                   P

P 0 (resp. Sq 0 ). By the assumption that I is stable under the action of the Steenrod
operations, u′ lies in I and hence in I1 . So if at least one of the di,j or ej is non-zero,
applying Proposition 3.4 we’re done.
   Hence we may assume that u has the form
                              X                X         X
                         u=       ai,j λi λj +   bj xj +    ci,j λi yj
                              i<j                  j             i,j

with not all coefficients being zero. As already noted, repeated application of P 0
(resp. Sq 0 ) will eventually kill such a u. Stopping at the last point before we get zero,
we may further assume that u has the form
                                X                         X
                           u=        ai,r λi λr + br xr +   cr,j λr yj
                                   i<r                       j

with not all coefficients being zero. If every cr,j = 0, then u lies in I2 and we are done
by Proposition 3.5. Hence we may assume that some cr,j is non-zero. Applying βP 0
(resp. Sq 1 ) and using the Cartan formula:
                           ℓ
                           X
                  ℓ
            βP (v · w) =         βP n (v) · P ℓ−n (w) + (−1)dim v P n (v)βP ℓ−n (w),
                           n=0

along with Lemma 2.2(b,d), we get
                              X p                X p
                   βP 0 (u) =     ai,r λi+1 xr −  cr,j xr yj ∈ I.
                                         i<r              j

And further applying βP 1 (resp. Sq 3 ) to this, using Lemma 2.2(a,b,c,d), we get
                                   X p2                 X p2
                 βP 1 βP 0 (u) = −      ai,r xi+1 xpr −  cr,j xpr zj ∈ I.

                  p             4
Now we apply P (resp. Sq ) to this. With the Cartan formula and Lemma 2.2(a,b,e),
we get                              X p3             X p3 2
                                                  2
              P p βP 1 βP 0 (u) = −  ai,r xi+2 xrp −  cr,j xpr zj ∈ I.

                           p2       p3               23       24
Successively applying P , P , . . . (resp. Sq , Sq , .. . ) we eventually
                                                                          conclude

which is of the desired form.

                                         4. Homomorphisms
   In order to show that the collection of elementary subgroup schemes detect nilpo-
tence and projectivity, we make extensive use of homomorphisms of the form φ : G →
Z/p and φ : G → Ga(1) . Although the cohomology rings of Z/p and Ga(1) are iden-
tical, as in Proposition 2.1, we will continue to use different notation to distinguish
the two: H ∗ (Z/p, k) = k[z1 ] ⊗ Λ(y1) (or k[y1 ] if p = 2, with z1 = y12) and similarly
H ∗ (Ga(1) , k) = k[x1 ] ⊗ Λ(λ1 ) (or k[λ1 ] if p = 2, with x1 = λ21 ). Of particular impor-
tance will be the image φ∗ (z1 ) (resp. φ∗ (x1 )) of z1 (resp. x1 ) under the induced map in
cohomology φ∗ : H ∗ (Z/p, k) → H ∗ (G, k) (resp. φ∗ : H ∗ (Ga(1) , k) → H ∗ (G, k)). The
significance of such homomorphisms is partially seen in the following key properties.
   An essential ingredient in the proof of Theorem 6.1 is the following generalization
of the Quillen-Venkov Lemma [25], whose proof is the same as that of [30, Propo-
sition 2.3] (see also [4]). A unital rational G-algebra Λ is a unital k-algebra which
admits a compatible structure of a rational G-module. That is, 1Λ lies in ΛG and
the multiplication map Λ ⊗k Λ → Λ is a map of rational G-modules. For exam-
ple, take Λ = Homk (M, M) for a rational G-module M. For such an algebra, we
denote by ρΛ : k → Λ the canonical homomorphism which defines 1Λ . Further, let
ρ∗Λ : H ∗ (G, k) → H ∗ (G, Λ) denote the induced map in cohomology.
Proposition 4.1. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite group scheme
over k, Λ be an associative, unital rational G-algebra, and φ : G → Z/p (resp. φ : G →
Ga(1) ) be a non-trivial homomorphism of group schemes over k. Let z ∈ H n (G, Λ)
satisfy z|ker φ = 0. Then z 2 is divisible by ρ∗Λ (φ∗ (z1 )) (resp. ρ∗Λ (φ∗ (x1 ))) ∈ H 2 (G, Λ).
   One of the ingredients in proving Proposition 4.1 is the following well known prop-
erty of the action of H ∗ (H, k) on H ∗ (H, Q), where H denotes either Z/p or Ga(1) ,
and Q is any H-module (cf. [8], [30, 2.3]): the action of z1 or x1 (as appropriate)
                                                ∼
induces a periodicity isomorphism H j (H, Q) −  → H j+2(H, Q) for all j > 0. This fact
is also the key ingredient in proving the following lemma which gives a condition for
a periodicity isomorphism for H ∗ (G, M) (for a rational G-module M) with respect
10                                CHRISTOPHER P. BENDEL

to the action of φ∗ (z1 ) or φ∗ (x1 ). This is a simple generalization of Lemma 1.2 of [8]
(see also [3]) and will be used several times in the proof of Theorem 8.1.
Lemma 4.2 (Chouinard [8]). Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite
group scheme over k, and M be a rational G-module. Let φ : G → Z/p (resp. φ :
G → Ga(1) ) be a non-trivial homomorphism of group schemes over k and let N denote
the kernel of φ. Suppose that H j (N, M) = 0 for all j > 0, then under the action
of H ∗ (G, k) on H ∗ (G, M), the action of φ∗ (z1 ) (resp. φ∗ (x1 )) induces a periodicity
                          ∼
isomorphism H j (G, M) −  → H j+2 (G, M) for all j > 0.
Proof. Let H denote either Z/p or Ga(1) and φ : G ։ H be the given homorphism.
Since φ is non-trivial we have a short exact sequence of group schemes over k:
                                   1→N →G→H →1
and a corresponding Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence
                      E2p,q (M) = H p (H, H q (N, M)) ⇒ H p+q (G, M).
By assumption, the spectral sequence collapses to
                      E2p,0 (M) = H p (H, H 0(N, M)) ⇒ H p+q (G, M)
and hence we have an isomorphism H ∗ (G, M) ≃ H ∗ (H, Q) where Q = H 0 (N, M).
The cohomology ring H ∗ (H, k) acts on the spectral sequence with the action on the
abutment via φ∗ . Hence, the periodicity isomorphism follows from that of z1 or x1
on H ∗ (H, Q).
                                 5. Cohomology Facts
   The homomorphisms discussed in the previous section are of interest because
they may be considered as elements of H 1 (G, k). More precisely, for any affine
group scheme G/k, we have H 1(G, k) = HomGr/k (G, Ga ) as abelian groups (cf. [30,
Lemma 1.1 (a)]). This can be refined in the case that G may be identified as a
semi-direct product G = G0 ⋊ π of an infinitesimal group scheme G0 with a finite
group π which acts on G0 via group scheme automorphisms. In such a situation,
let HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π denote those homomorphisms of group schemes over k which
are preserved by the action of π. That is to say, those φ : G0 → Ga such that
φ(x(g)) = φ(g) for all x ∈ π and g ∈ G0 , where x(g) denotes the image of g under
the action of x on G0 .
Lemma 5.1. Let G be an affine group scheme over k which may be identified as a
semi-direct product G = G0 ⋊ π of an infinitesimal group scheme G0 with a finite
group π. Then H 1 (G, k) = HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π × HomGr/k (π, Ga ) (as abelian groups).
Proof. Any homomorphism φ : G → Ga determines two homomorphisms φ1 : G0 →
Ga by φ1 (g) = φ((g, 1π )) and φ2 : π → Ga by φ2 (x) = φ((1G0 , x)). Further, φ1
necessarily preserves the action of π. Given any g ∈ G0 and x ∈ π, since φ is a
homomorphism, we have
φ((x(g), x)) = φ((x(g), 1π ) · (1G0 , x)) = φ((x(g), 1π )) + φ((1G0 , x)) = φ1 (x(g)) + φ2 (x).
On the other hand, we also have
     φ((x(g), x)) = φ((1G0 , x) · (g, 1π )) = φ((1G0 , x)) + φ((g, 1π )) = φ2 (x) + φ1 (g).

Hence, we must have φ1 (x(g)) = φ1 (g) as claimed.
  Conversely, given homomorphisms φ1 ∈ HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π and φ2 ∈ HomGr/k (π, Ga ),
define a map φ : G → Ga by φ((g, x)) = φ1 (g) + φ2(x). For any pair (g1 , x1 ), (g2, x2 ) ∈
G, we check that φ is in fact a homomorphism. On the one hand, we have
      φ((g1 , x1 ) · (g2 , x2 )) = φ((g1 · x1 (g2 ), x1 · x2 ) = φ1 (g1 · x1 (g2 )) + φ2 (x1 · x2 )
                              = φ1 (g1 ) + φ1 (x1 (g2 )) + φ2 (x1 ) + φ2 (x2 ).
On the other hand,
              φ((g1 , x1 )) + φ((g2, x2 )) = φ1 (g1 ) + φ2 (x1 ) + φ1 (g2 ) + φ2 (x2 ).
Since φ1 (x1 (g2 )) = φ1 (g2 ), these agree and φ is a homomorphism.
   The first step in the proofs of the main results is to reduce to the case that G
is a unipotent group scheme. This allows us to make use of the following result of
[30] which is a generalization of a classical result for finite p-groups (cf. [13, Theorem
7.2.4]).
Lemma 5.2 ([30, Lemma 1.2]). Let ψ : G → H be a surjective homomorphism of
unipotent group schemes over k. If ψ ∗ : H 1 (H, k) → H 1 (G, k) is an isomorphism and
if ψ ∗ : H 2(H, k) → H 2 (G, k) is injective, then ψ is an isomorphism.
   For unipotent group schemes there is a nice cohomological criterion (Proposition
5.3) for detecting projectivity which is well known for p-groups and holds more gen-
erally. We remind the reader that for a finite group G a kG-module is projective if
and only if it is injective. More generally, any finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf
algebra is a Frobenius algebra (cf. [19], [21]) and hence a module over such an algebra
is in fact projective if and only if it is injective (cf. [14]). So this equivalence holds
for arbitrary finite group schemes. Further, the theory of finite dimensional algebras
shows that if k is the only simple module for such an algebra (e.g., for a unipotent
group scheme), then the algebra is indecomposable as a module over itself, and hence
a module is in fact projective if and only if it is free. Thus, over a finite unipotent
group scheme, the notions of projective, injective, and free are all equivalent.
Proposition 5.3 (cf. [4] or [3]). Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0 and G be a
finite unipotent group scheme over k. For any rational G-module M, M is projective
( = injective = free ) if and only if H 1 (G, M) = 0.
  In order to reduce to the case of a unipotent group scheme, we use the injectivity
of certain restriction maps in cohomology. If π is a finite group and πS ⊂ π is
a p-Sylow subgroup, then for any kπ-module M the restriction map in cohomology
H ∗ (π, M) → H ∗ (πS , M) is an injection (cf. [4] or [13]). This can be partially extended
to the more general setting of finite group schemes.
Lemma 5.4. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0 and G be a finite group scheme
over k which can be identified as a semi-direct product G = G0 ⋊ π of an infinitesimal
group scheme G0 (which is a closed subgroup scheme in G) and a finite group π.
Further, let πS ⊂ π be a p-Sylow subgroup of π and M be a rational G-module. Then
the restriction map H ∗ (G, M) → H ∗ (GS , M) for the embedding GS = G0 ⋊ πS ֒→
G0 ⋊ π = G is an injection.

Proof. The idea is to identify G-cohomology groups with certain π-cohomology groups.
We first note that there exists a projective resolution X• ։ k of rational G0 -modules
which admits a compatible action of the finite group π. That is, this is also a
complex of π-modules and for any x ∈ π, g ∈ G0 , and m ∈ Xn (any n) we have
x · (g · m) = x(g) · (x · m). Consider the cobar resolution (cf. [19])
                              k → k[G] → k[G]⊗2 → . . .
which is an injective resolution of k over G. Further, this is a sequence of rational
G-modules and maps if G is defined to act by the left regular representation on the
first k[G] factor of each term k[G]⊗n (cf. [19]). Hence π ⊂ G acts on the sequence and
does so compatibly with respect to its action on G0 . Let X• be the dual complex (i.e.,
take the k-linear dual of each module and reverse the arrows). Then X• is necessarily
a projective resolution of k over G, which can be considered as a resolution over G0
on which π acts compatibly. Finally, since G0 is a closed subgroup scheme of G,
any projective G-module is also a projective G0 -module (cf. [19]). So X• is in fact a
projective resolution of k over G0 with π acting compatibly.
   Given that such a resolution exists, the same argument as on p. 19 of [13] (for a
semi-direct product of finite groups) shows that there is an isomorphism
                H ∗ (G, M) = H ∗ (G0 ⋊ π, M) ≃ H ∗ (π, HomG0 (X• , M))
where the latter cohomology group is a hypercohomology group. That is, the coeffi-
cients consist of a cochain complex of modules. Further, this isomorphism is preserved
under the natural embedding πS ֒→ π so that the following diagram commutes:
                                         ∼
                   H ∗ (G0 ⋊ π, M) −−−→ H ∗ (π, HomG0 (X• , M))
                                                  
                        resy
                                                  res
                                                   y
                                         ∼
                  H ∗ (G0 ⋊ πS , M) −−−→ H ∗ (πS , HomG0 (X• , M)).
Finally, the left hand map will be injective if the right hand map is. However, the
injectivity of the right hand restriction map in ordinary cohomology can be extended
to hypercohomology. For example, one standard proof in ordinary cohomology (cf. [4]
or [13]) is based on the fact that for a kπ-module N, the composite
                                   res             Tr
                        H ∗ (π, N) −→ H ∗ (πS , N) −→ H ∗ (π, N)
is multiplication by the index [π : πS ] which is invertible in k, where T r denotes the
transfer map. Hence the composite is an injection and so the restriction map is also.
This same argument works with N replaced by a cochain complex.
   Alternately, by the Eckmann-Shapiro lemma, we may identify
                  H ∗ (πS , N) = Ext∗πS (k, N) ≃ Ext∗π (kπ ⊗kπS k, N),
and the restriction map
                                     res
           H ∗ (π, N) = Ext∗π (k, N) −→ Ext∗πS (k, N) ≃ Ext∗π (kπ ⊗kπS k, N)
is simply the map induced from the canonical map kπ ⊗kπS k → k which sends
x ⊗ c 7→  P c. This module map is split by the map k → kπ ⊗kπS k which sends
1 7→ |T1 | t∈T t ⊗ 1, where T ⊂ π is a set of left coset representatives of πS in π. This
                            COHOMOLOGY AND PROJECTIVITY                                   13

splitting of the module map induces a splitting of the restriction map in cohomology
when N is either a module or a complex.
                 6. The Restriction Theorem in Cohomology
  In this section we present a generalization of Theorem 1.4 on detecting nilpotent
cohomology classes, which is also an extension of Theorem 2.5 of [30] which applies
to infinitesimal unipotent group schemes.
Theorem 6.1. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite group scheme
over k, and Λ be an associative, unital rational G-algebra (as defined in Section 4).
Suppose further that the (infinitesimal) connected component of the identity, G0 , of G
is unipotent. If z ∈ H n (G, Λ) satisfies the property that for any field extension K/k
and any group scheme embedding ν : Er,s ⊗k K ֒→ G ⊗k K over K the cohomology
class ν ∗ (z) ∈ H n (Er,s ⊗k K, Λ ⊗k K) is nilpotent, then z is itself nilpotent.
Proof. The strategy of the proof is to extend that of Theorem 2.5 in [30]. For any field
extension K/k, since H ∗ (G ⊗k K, Λ ⊗k K) = H ∗ (G, Λ) ⊗k K (cf. [19]), if z is nilpotent
after base change, then it is necessarily nilpotent. Hence it suffices to assume that k
is algebraically closed. In this case, the points of G are certainly k-rational and so, as
noted in the Introduction, we can identify G as the semi-direct product G0 ⋊ π where
π = G(k) is the finite group of k-points of G. By assumption, G0 is unipotent, but π
may be an arbitrary finite group. However, by Lemma 5.4, we may assume that π is
in fact a p-group, for, if z is nilpotent after restriction to the subgroup G0 ⋊ πS (for
a p-Sylow subgroup πS of π), since the restriction map in cohomology is injective, z
must necessarily be nilpotent. Hence, the group G may be assumed to be unipotent.
   We now proceed by induction on dimk k[G] and are trivially done if dimk k[G] = 1
or G = Er,s , and so assume that the theorem holds for all groups H over any field
K/k with dimK K[H] < dimk k[G]. As in Section 4, let ρ∗Λ : H ∗ (G, k) → H ∗ (G, Λ)
denote the map induced by the module map ρΛ : k → Λ which defines 1Λ .
   The next step is to reduce to the case that π is elementaryQabelian.  Q If not, by Serre’s
theorem (Theorem 3.1), there exists a finite product u = ui = β(vi ) ∈ H ∗ (π, k)
which is zero in H ∗ (π, k) for non-zero vi ∈ H 1 (π, k). Each vi can be considered as
a non-zero map π → Z/p, which can be extended to φi : G ։ π ։ Z/p. Let Ni
denote the kernel of φi . Since φi is non-trivial, dimk k[Ni ] < dimk k[G] and so by
induction, the restriction of z to each Ni is nilpotent. Hence, by Proposition 4.1, z 2
is divisible by ρ∗Λ (φ∗i (z1 )) for each i. Consider the canonical projection ψ : G → π and
the induced map ψ ∗ : H ∗ (π, k) → H ∗ (G, k). Since ψ ∗ (ui ) = φ∗i (z1 ) for each i, some
power of z is divisible by ρ∗Λ (ψ ∗ (u)) and hence is zero.
   Hence, we may assume that π = Es for some s (possibly zero). In the trivial
case s = 0, we have G = G0 and the claim is precisely Theorem 2.5 of [30]. In
any case, the succeeding argument holds in general (with Case I being impossible in
that situation). The remainder of the argument consists of three cases depending on
dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π and uses arguments similar to those in the above reduction
to the case that π is elementary abelian.
CASE I: dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π = 0
   Consider the natural projection ψ : G = G0 ⋊ π → π and the induced map ψ ∗ :
H ∗ (π, k) → H ∗ (G, k). By the assumption and Lemma 5.1, we have an isomorphism
14                              CHRISTOPHER P. BENDEL

ψ ∗ : H 1 (π, k) → H 1 (G, k). Consider the map in degree 2, ψ ∗ : H 2 (π, k) → H 2 (G, k).
By Lemma 5.2, either G ≃ π ≃ Es and we are done or I ≡ ker(ψ ∗ ) contains some
non-zero element of degree 2. Now, the map ψ ∗ preserves the action of the Steenrod
algebra (cf. [12], [27], and also [30]) and hence I is a homogeneous ideal stable under
the action ofQ   the Steenrod  operations. By Proposition 3.4, there exists a non-zero
product u = ui = β(vi ) ∈ H ∗ (π, k) which lies in I. In other words, the image of
                        Q
u under ψ ∗ is zero in H ∗ (G, k). On the other hand, arguing as above, by Proposition
4.1, we conclude that some power of z is divisible by ρ∗Λ (ψ ∗ (u)) and hence is zero.
CASE II: dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π = 1
   Let θ : G0 → Ga be a representative map preserved by π = Es . Since G0 is
infinitesimal, the image of θ lands in some Ga(r) . If r > 1, the composition
                                            θ       F
                                     G0 → Ga → Ga ,
where F is the Frobenius morphism, would give another linearly independent ho-
momorphism preserved by π. Hence we must have θ : G0 → Ga(1) . Consider the
                                     θ×Id
homomorphism η : G = G0 ⋊ Es −−→ Ga(1) × Es = E1,s and the induced morphism
η ∗ : H ∗ (E1,s , k) → H ∗ (G, k). Specifically, consider the map on H 1 (cf. Lemma 5.1):
        H 1 (E1,s , k) = HomGr/k (Ga(1) , Ga ) × HomGr/k (Es , Ga )
                       → HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )Es × HomGr/k (Es , Ga ) = H 1 (G, k).
Again, this is evidently an isomorphism and as before, either G ≃ E1,s and we’re done
                                               in I = ker(η ∗ ). In the latter case, by
or there exists a non-zero element of degree 2 Q
Proposition 3.6, there exists a product u = x1 ui ∈ H ∗ (E1,s , k) which lies in I.
                                             n

  Each element ui may again be identified with β(vi ) for some non-zero vi ∈ H 1 (Es , k).
Just as above, for each i, we consider the homomorphism φi : G ։ Es ։ Z/p corre-
sponding to vi and conclude by Proposition 4.1 that z 2 is divisible by ρ∗Λ (η ∗ (ui )).
  On the other hand, consider the composite
                                                η
                        φ : G = G0 ⋊ Es −
                                        → Ga(1) × Es ։ Ga(1) ,
where the last map is the canonical projection. By Proposition 4.1, z 2 is also divisible
by ρ∗Λ (η ∗ (x1 )). Hence some power of z is divisible by ρΛ (η ∗ (u)) and thus zero since
η ∗ (u) is zero in H ∗ (G, k).
CASE III: dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π > 1
    This case must be further divided into two, based on dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga(1) )π . As
noted above, since G0 is infinitesimal, any φ : G0 → Ga has image in some Ga(r) . So
there is certainly one non-trivial π-preserved map G0 → Ga(1) , but there need not be
two linearly independent such maps.
    CASE III(a): dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga(1) )π = 1
    The proof of this case is similar to the proof of Theorem 1.6 in [30]. Let θ :
G0 → Ga(1) be a non-trivial representative map preserved by π. Since θ is preserved
by the action of π, it can be extended to a non-trivial map φ : G → Ga(1) by
φ((g, x)) = θ(g). The Frobenius map F : Ga → Ga induces via composition a
map (of the same name) F : HomGr/k (G0 , Ga ) → HomGr/k (G0 , Ga ). Further, since
any π-preserved map remains so after composition with F , this restricts to a map
F : HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π → HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π , and we may identify the kernel of this
                             COHOMOLOGY AND PROJECTIVITY                                     15

(restricted) map with HomGr/k (G0 , Ga(1) )π (cf. [30, Lemma 1.1]). By assumption, the
kernel must then be one-dimensional, and so there exists a non-negative integer r
and homomorphism ζ ∈ HomGr/k (G0 , Ga(r) )π with F r−1 (ζ) = θ and such that the set
{ζ, F (ζ), . . . , F r−1 (ζ)} is a basis for the subspace HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π ⊂ H 1 (G, k).
                                                          ζ×Id
 Consider the homomorphism η : G = G0 ⋊ Es −−→ Ga(r) × Es and the induced
map on cohomology η ∗ : H ∗ (Er,s, k) → H ∗ (G, k). On H 1 the map
         H 1 (Er,s , k) = HomGr/k (Ga(r) , Ga ) × HomGr/k (Es , Ga )
                         → HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )Es × HomGr/k (Es , Ga ) = H 1 (G, k)
is the identity on the right factor and on the left factor maps the basis λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λr
to the basis ζ, F (ζ), . . . , F r−1(ζ) = θ. Hence, this is an isomorphism and either
G ≃ Er,s and we’re done or there is a homomorphism η : G → Er,s for which (by
Proposition 3.6)
              Q the kernel       of η ∗ : H ∗ (Er,s , k) → H ∗ (G, k) contains an element of the
form u = xr ui with η (xr ) = θ∗ (x1 ) = φ∗ (x1 ) and for each i, η ∗ (ui ) = φ∗i (z1 ) for
            n                 ∗

some non-trivial φi : G → Z/p. By Proposition 4.1 and the usual argument, some
power of z is divisible by ρ∗Λ (η ∗ (u)) and hence is zero.
   CASE III(b): dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga(1) )π > 1
   Let θ1 : G0 → Ga(1) and θ2 : G0 → Ga(1) be two linearly independent (and non-
trivial) homomorphisms which are preserved by the action of π. Since they are
preserved by π, these maps can be extended to maps φ1 : G → Ga(1) by φ1 ((g, x)) =
θ1 (g) and φ2 : G → Ga(1) by φ2 ((g, x)) = θ2 (g). Clearly these remain non-trivial and
linearly independent maps G → Ga(1) . Now, the identical argument as in the case
dimk HomGr/k (G, Ga(1) ) > 1 in the proof of [30, Theorem 2.5] may be applied with φ1
and φ2 to imply that z is indeed nilpotent.

Question 6.2. Can this result be extended to any finite group scheme G?

Remark 6.3. Given a homomorphism Er,s → G of group schemes over k, the image
of Er,s is necessarily a closed subgroup and moreover isomorphic to an elementary
group scheme Er′ ,s′ for some r ′ ≤ r, s′ ≤ s. Hence, Theorem 6.1 (as well as succeeding
results) could be stated either in terms of homomorphisms of the form Er,s → G or
in terms of closed subgroup schemes of the form Er,s .
                                    7. Consequences
   In this section, we note some immediate consequences of Theorem 6.1. First, we
note a slightly weaker version of the theorem, which is stated in terms of Ext-groups
like Theorem 1.4. Given a rational G-module M, the algebra Λ ≡ Homk (M, M) is an
associative, unital rational G-algebra, and hence the theorem applies to Λ. Further,
there is a natural isomorphism H ∗ (G, Λ) ≃ Ext∗G (M, M). In the case that M is finite
dimensional, for any field extension K/k, we have Ext∗G⊗k K (M ⊗k K, M ⊗k K) ≃
Ext∗G (M, M) ⊗k K. Hence, the following is an immediate consequence of Theorem
6.1.
Corollary 7.1. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite group scheme
over k, and M be a finite dimensional rational G-module. Suppose further that the
(infinitesimal) connected component of the identity, G0 , of G is unipotent. If z ∈
16                              CHRISTOPHER P. BENDEL

ExtnG (M, M) satisfies the property that for any field extension K/k and any group
scheme embedding ν : Er,s ⊗k K ֒→ G ⊗k K over K the cohomology class ν ∗ (z) ∈
ExtnEr,s ⊗k K (M ⊗k K, M ⊗k K) is nilpotent, then z is itself nilpotent.
   A standard argument (cf. [4], [30]) which is sketched below shows that a general-
ization of Chouinard’s theorem (Theorem 1.3) follows from Corollary 7.1.
Corollary 7.2. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite group scheme
over k, and M be a finite dimensional rational G-module. Suppose further that the
(infinitesimal) connected component of the identity, G0 , of G is unipotent. Then M
is projective as a G-module if and only if for every field extension K/k and closed
subgroup scheme H ⊂ G ⊗k K with H ≃ Er,s ⊗k K the restriction of M ⊗k K to H is
projective.
Proof. If M is projective over G, then it remains so upon restriction to any closed
subgroup scheme (cf. [19]). Conversely, given an H ⊂ G ⊗k K with H ≃ Er,s ⊗k K,
if M ⊗k K is projective upon restriction, then ExtiH (M ⊗k K, M ⊗k K) = 0 for
all i > 0. Hence, by Corollary 7.1, every element z ∈ ExtnG (M, M) for n > 0 is
nilpotent. Since, by [17], Ext∗G (M, M) is finitely generated over the Noetherian ring
H 2∗ (G, k) = Ext2∗                           i
                 G (k, k), we must have ExtG (M, M) = 0 for all i > N for some N.
As the notions of projective and injective are equivalent (see the discussion preceding
Proposition 5.3), it follows that M must in fact be projective.
   Let g be a finite dimensional restricted Lie algebra over k with restricted en-
veloping algebra u(g). As mentioned in the Introduction, this corresponds to a cer-
tain (height 1) infinitesimal group scheme. Theorem 6.1 applied to the correspond-
ing group scheme says that nilpotence is detected by the collection of subalgebras
u(hxi) ⊂ u(g ⊗k K) for each p-nilpotent element x ∈ g ⊗k K. Here u(hxi) denotes
the subalgebra generated by x and is simply isomorphic to K[x]/(xp ) as an algebra.
Using this special case, we can obtain a restriction theorem in terms of subalgebras
of the form K[x]/(xp ).
Corollary 7.3. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite group scheme
over k, and M be a finite dimensional rational G-module. Suppose further that the
(infinitesimal) connected component of the identity, G0 , of G is unipotent. If z ∈
ExtnG (M, M) satisfies the property that for any field extension K/k and any embedding
of algebras ν : B ֒→ K[G ⊗k K]∗ with B ≃ K[x]/(xp ) the cohomology class ν ∗ (z) ∈
ExtnB (M ⊗k K, M ⊗k K) is nilpotent, then z is itself nilpotent.
Proof. For any closed subgroup scheme of the form Er,s ⊗k K ⊂ G ⊗k K, the corre-
sponding Hopf algebra A = K[Er,s ⊗k K]∗ is isomorphic as an algebra to the restricted
enveloping algebra, u(g), of an abelian Lie algebra g over K with trivial p-mapping.
Given an A-module N, let Ñ denote the module N considered as a u(g)-module.
As Yoneda algebras, we necessarily have Ext∗A (N, N) ≃ Ext∗u(g) (Ñ , Ñ). Hence, an
element of Ext∗A (N, N) is nilpotent if and only if it is nilpotent when considered as
an element of Ext∗u(g) (Ñ, Ñ ). As nilpotence is detected by certain Hopf subalgebras
of the form K[x]/(xp ) in the latter case, this is also true in the former. So, if z is
nilpotent upon restriction to all subalgebras K[x]/(xp ), it is nilpotent upon restriction
to each Er,s ⊗k K and hence, by Corollary 7.1, is itself nilpotent.

Remark 7.4. Evidently it suffices to take only some of the subalgebras of the form
K[x]/(xp ), i.e., those which are “contained in” an elementary subgroup scheme of G.
                           8. Detecting Projectivity
  As seen in the previous section, an almost immediate corollary of the restriction the-
orem on nilpotent cohomology classes (Theorem 6.1) is a generalization of Chouinard’s
theorem (Theorem 1.3) for finite dimensional modules (Corollary 7.2). In this section,
we show that essentially the same proof as for Theorem 6.1 can be used to extend
this result to infinite dimensional modules, by replacing applications of Proposition
4.1 with applications of Lemma 4.2.
Theorem 8.1. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite group scheme over
k, and M be a rational G-module. Suppose further that the (infinitesimal) connected
component of the identity, G0 , of G is unipotent and that all the points of G are k-
rational. Then M is projective as a G-module if and only if for every field extension
K/k and closed subgroup scheme H ⊂ G ⊗k K with H ≃ Er,s ⊗k K the restriction of
M ⊗k K to H is projective.

Remark 8.2. If M is assumed to be finite dimensional, then the proof shows that
it suffices to take the single field extension K = k̄, the algebraic closure of k. In
this sense, it is a slightly stronger result than Corollary 7.2 and more comparable to
Proposition 7.6 of [30] (as well as to Chouinard’s theorem).
Proof. As previously noted, if M is projective over G, then it remains so upon restric-
tion to any closed subgroup scheme (cf. [19]). Conversely, suppose that all restrictions
are projective. The outline of the proof is the same as for the proof of Theorem 6.1
with the details modified along the lines of the proof of the Theorem in [3] which was
based on the original arguments of Chouinard [8].
   By the assumption on the points of G (see the Introduction), we may write G =
G0 ⋊ π as usual, with G0 assumed to be unipotent. The first step is to reduce to the
case that π is a p-group. Let πS ⊂ π be a p-Sylow subgroup of π, and let GS denote
the subgroup G0 ⋊ πS ⊂ G. To show that M is projective, it suffices to show that
ExtiG (M, N) ≃ H i (G, Homk (M, N)) = 0 for all i > 0 and any rational G-module N.
If M is projective over GS , then H i (GS , Homk (M, N)) = 0 for all i > 0, and since,
by Lemma 5.4, the restriction map H ∗ (G, Homk (M, N)) → H ∗ (GS , Homk (M, N)) is
an injection, we also have H i (G, Homk (M, N)) = 0 for all i > 0. Thus it suffices to
assume that π is a p-group and G is in fact unipotent.
   Under the assumption that G is unipotent, to show that M is projective over
G, it suffices, by Proposition 5.3, to show that H 1 (G, M) = 0. If L/k is any field
extension, then H ∗ (G ⊗k L, M ⊗k L) = H ∗ (G, M) ⊗k L (cf. [19]). Hence, if it can be
shown that H 1 (G ⊗k L, M ⊗k L) = 0 for some field extension L/k, then we also have
H 1 (G, M) = 0. So it suffices to assume that k is algebraically closed.
   We now proceed by induction on dimk k[G] and are trivially done if dimk k[G] = 1
or G = Er,s , and so assume that the theorem holds for all groups H over any field
K/k with dimK K[H] < dimk k[G].
   As in the proof of Theorem 6.1, the next step is to reduce the problem to the
case that π is elementary abelian. If π is not elementary abelian, by Serre’s theorem

(Theorem 3.1), there exists a finite product u = ui = β(vi ) ∈ H ∗ (π, k) which
                                                         Q        Q
is zero in H ∗ (π, k) for non-zero vi ∈ H 1 (π, k). Each vi can be considered as a non-
zero map π ։ Z/p, which can be extended to φi : G ։ π ։ Z/p. Let Ni denote
the kernel of φi . Since φi is non-trivial, dimk k[Ni ] < dimk k[G] and so by induction
M is projective upon restriction to Ni for each i. Hence, H j (Ni , M) = 0 for all
j > 0 and each i, and so by Lemma 4.2 the action of φ∗i (z1 ) = ψ ∗ (ui ) (where ψ ∗ :
H ∗ (π, k) → H ∗ (G, k) is induced from the canonical projection ψ : G → π) induces a
periodicity
Q ∗            isomorphism H j (G, M) → H j+2(G, M) for all j > 0. Hence, the product
                  ∗        ∗                                         1                ∗
   i φi (ui ) = ψ (u) ∈ H (G, k) acts via an isomorphism on H (G, M). But, ψ (u) is
zero and so we must have H 1 (G, M) = 0. Thus M is projective.
   From now on we may suppose that π = Es for some s (possibly zero). In the trivial
case s = 0, we have G = G0 and the claim is precisely the Theorem in [3]. In any case,
the following argument still holds (with Case I being impossible in that situation). As
in 6.1, the rest of the proof consists of three steps based on dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π
with arguments like the preceding one.
CASE I: dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π = 0
   Consider the natural projection ψ : G = G0 ⋊ π → π and the induced map
ψ ∗ : H ∗ (π, k) → H ∗ (G, k). By assumption and Lemma 5.1, we have an isomorphism
ψ ∗ : H 1 (π, k) → H 1 (G, k). Consider the map in degree 2, ψ ∗ : H 2 (π, k) → H 2 (G, k).
By Lemma 5.2, either G ≃ π ≃ Es and we are done or I ≡ ker(ψ ∗ ) contains some
non-zero element of degree 2. Again, the map ψ ∗ preserves the action of the Steenrod
algebra and hence I is a homogeneous ideal stable under the actionQof theQ         Steenrod
operations. By Proposition 3.4, there exists a non-zero product u = ui = β(vi ) ∈
H ∗ (π, k) which lies in I. In other words, its image under ψ ∗ is zero in H ∗ (G, k). On
the other hand, applying the above argument to u, we conclude that ψ ∗ (u) acts
isomorphically on H 1 (G, M) and hence H 1 (G, M) = 0.
CASE II: dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π = 1
   Just as in 6.1, there is a homomorphism η : G → Ga(1) ×Es = E1,s which is either an
isomorphism (in which case we’re done) or there exists a non-zero element of degree
2 in I = ker{η ∗ : H ∗ (E1,sQ, k) → H ∗ (G, k). In the latter case, by Proposition 3.6, there
exists a product u = x1 ui ∈ H ∗ (E1,s , k) which lies in I.
                          n

   Each element ui may again be identified with β(vi ) for some non-zero vi ∈ H 1 (Es , k).
Just as above, for each i, we consider the homomorphism φi : G ։ Es ։ Z/p cor-
responding to vi and conclude that the action of η ∗ (ui ) = φ∗i (z1 ) ∈ H 2 (G, k) on
                                                   ∼
H ∗ (G, M) gives an isomorphism H j (G, M) −      → H j+2(G, M) for all j > 0.
   On the other hand, consider the composite
                                            η
                        φ : G = G0 ⋊ Es −
                                        → Ga(1) × Es ։ Ga(1) ,
where the last map is the canonical projection. By Lemma 4.2, φ∗ (x1 ) = η ∗ (x1 )
                                                  ∼
induces a periodicity isomorphism H j (G, M) −    → H j+2(G, M) for all j > 0. Hence
η ∗ (u) acts isomorphically on H 1 (G, M). Since η ∗ (u) is zero in H ∗ (G, k) we must have
that H 1 (G, M) = 0.
CASE III: dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga )π > 1
    This case is again divided into two sub-cases based on dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga(1) )π .
    CASE III(a): dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga(1) )π = 1
                            COHOMOLOGY AND PROJECTIVITY                                      19

    As in 6.1, we deduce that there is a homomorphism η : G → Ga(r) × Es = Er,s
which is either an isomorphism (in which case we’re done) or the kernel of η ∗ :
H ∗ (Er,s , k) → H ∗ (G, k) contains a non-zero element of degree 2. In the latter
                                                                                 Q case,
                                                                              n
by Proposition 3.6, the kernel contains an element of the form u = xr ui with
η ∗ (xr ) = φ∗ (x1 ) for some non-trivial φ : G → Ga(1) and η ∗ (ui ) = φ∗i (z1 ) for some
non-trivial φi : G → Z/p for each i. As above, the actions of η ∗ (xr ) and η ∗ (ui ) (for
each i) induce a periodicity isomorphism H j (G, M) → H j+2(G, M) for all j > 0.
Hence, η ∗ (u) acts isomorphically, but since it’s zero we must have H 1 (G, M) = 0.
    CASE III(b): dimk HomGr/k (G0 , Ga(1) )π > 1
    Let θ1 and θ2 be two linearly independent and non-trivial homomorphisms G0 →
Ga(1) which preserve the action of π. These can then be extended to two linearly
independent and non-trivial homomorphisms φ1 , φ2 : G → Ga(1) . We now apply the
same argument as in [3] to the maps φ1 and φ2 .
    For any homorphism φ : G → Ga(1) , let xφ denote the image of the canonical
generator x1 ∈ H 2 (Ga(1) , k) under the induced map in cohomology. Once again, the
inductive argument as above shows that both xφ1 = φ∗1 (x1 ) and xφ2 = φ∗2 (x1 ) induce
                                         ∼
periodicity isomorphisms H j (G, M) −   → H j+2(G, M) for all j > 0. Moreover, for any
c1 , c2 ∈ k, by Corollary 1.5 of [30],
             c1 xφ1 + c2 xφ2 = xc1/p φ1 + xc1/p φ2 = xc1/p φ1 +c1/p φ2 ∈ H 2 (G, k).
                                  1           2         1       2

                                                                                 1/p   1/p
If at least one of c1 , c2 is non-zero, by linear independence, the map c1 φ1 + c2 φ2 :
G → Ga(1) is non-trivial and hence by Lemma 4.2, the element c1 xφ1 + c2 xφ2 also
                                                    ∼
induces a periodicity isomorphism H 1 (G, M) −      → H 3 (G, M). On the contrary, since
k is by assumption algebraically closed, if M is finite-dimensional, an eigenvalue
argument implies that for some c1 , c2 with not both zero, this map will not be an
isomorphism unless H 1 (G, M) = 0. Thus, for finite dimensional modules the proof is
complete and we see that it is only necessary to extend to the algebraic closure of k.
   For infinite dimensional M, this eigenvalue argument need not work and must be
replaced by an infinite dimensional substitute used in [6] and which requires a further
field extension. Let K/k be any non-trivial algebraically closed field extension. After
base change, the (extended) maps φ1 , φ2 : G ⊗k K → Ga(1) ⊗k K remain linearly
independent. Hence, as the inductive arguments apply equally well over K, we again
conclude that for any c1 , c2 ∈ K with not both zero, the element
                    c1 xφ1 + c2 xφ2 = xc1/p φ1 +c1/p φ2 ∈ H 2 (G ⊗k K, K)
                                          1       2

also induces a periodicity isomorphism
H 1 (G ⊗k K, M ⊗k K) = H 1 (G, M) ⊗k K → H 3 (G ⊗k K, M ⊗k K) = H 3 (G, M) ⊗k K.
Applying Lemma 4.1 of [6] (or Lemma 2 of [3]) we conclude that H 1 (G, M) = 0 as
desired.

Question 8.3. Can this result be extended to any finite group scheme G?
  We end this section by recalling Dade’s Lemma [11, Lemma 11.8] which says that
projectivity (or freeness) of a finite dimensional module for an elementary abelian
group E can be detected on “cyclic shifted subgroups”, that is, on certain subalgebras
20                                   CHRISTOPHER P. BENDEL

of kE of the form k[x]/(xp ). Indeed, this is simply a statement about detecting
projectivity (or equivalently freeness) of modules over a truncated polynomial algebra
k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]/(xp1 , xp2 , . . . , xpn ). However, Dade’s lemma as originally stated holds
only for finite dimensional modules. In [6], D. Benson, J. Carlson, and J. Rickard
extend Dade’s Lemma to arbitrary modules but at the cost of having to consider field
extensions. Indeed, they note that the lemma fails in general without this assumption.
We restate it here from a purely algebra perspective.
Proposition 8.4 (Dade’s Lemma – [6, Theorem 5.2]). Let k be a field of character-
istic p > 0, n > 0 be an integer, An = k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]/(xp1 , xp2 , . . . , xpn ) be a truncated
polynomial algebra over k, and M be an An -module. Then M is projective over An if
and only if for every field extension K/k, the restriction  P of M ⊗k K to the subalgebra
K[x]/(xp ) ⊂ An ⊗k K is free for each non-zero x = ni=1 ci xi with ci ∈ K.

Remark 8.5. If M is finite dimensional, it suffices to take a single field extension
K with K algebraically closed. In general, it suffices to take a field extension of
transcendence degree at least n − 1 over the algebraic closure k̄ of k.
   Indeed, it is precisely the necessity of field extensions in this general version of
Dade’s Lemma which makes field extensions necessary in Theorem 8.1, whereas they
are not necessary for Chouinard’s theorem (Theorem 1.3). This is because our gen-
erality includes the case of a restricted Lie algebra. If we take for example an abelian
Lie algebra with trivial restriction map, then Theorem 8.1 becomes precisely Dade’s
Lemma (see the discussion preceding Corollary 7.3).
   Theorem 8.1 says that projectivity for G or for the corresponding Hopf algebra
k[G]∗ can be detected on subgroups of the from Er,s = Ga(r) × Es . Denote the
corresponding Hopf algebra k[Er,s ]∗ ≃ k[Ga(r) ]∗ ⊗ kEs by Ar,s . As an algebra, we have
already observed that Ar,s is simply isomorphic to k[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]/(xp1 , xp2 , . . . , xpn )
where n = r + s. Hence, combining Theorem 8.1 with Dade’s Lemma, we get the
following detection result.
Corollary 8.6. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0, G be a finite group scheme
over k, and M be a rational G-module. Suppose further that the (infinitesimal)
connected component of the identity, G0 , of G is unipotent and that all the points
of G are k-rational. If for every field extension K/k and subalgebra of the form
K[x]/(xp ) ⊂ K[G ⊗k K]∗ , M ⊗k K is free upon restriction to K[x]/(xp ), then M is
projective over G.

Remark 8.7. Evidently it suffices to take only some of the subalgebras of the form
K[x]/(xp ), i.e., those which are “contained in” an elementary subgroup scheme of G.
