                                                                                     Abstract
                                                      This paper is concerned with the representation theory of finite groups. Ac-
                                                  cording to Robinson, the truth of certain variants of Alperin’s weight conjecture
                                                  on the p-blocks of a finite group would imply some arithmetical conditions on
                                                  the degrees of the irreducible (complex) characters of that group. The purpose
                                                  of this note is to prove directly that one of these arithmetical conditions is true
                                                  in the case where we consider a finite group of Lie type in good characteristic.

                                                 According to Robinson [8, Theorem 5.1] (see also [9, §5]), the truth of cer-
                                             tain variants of Alperin’s weight conjecture on the p-blocks of a finite group
                                             would imply some arithmetical conditions on the p-parts of the degrees of the
                                             irreducible (complex) characters of that group. The purpose of this note is to
                                             prove directly that one of these arithmetical conditions is true in the case where
                                             we consider a finite group of Lie type in good characteristic. (See Example 2
                                             for the problems which arise in bad characteristic.)
                                                 Let G be a connected reductive group defined over the finite field Fq , where
                                             q is a power of some prime p. Let F : G → G be the corresponding Frobenius
                                             map and GF the finite group of fixed points. Recall that p is good for G if p
                                             is good for each simple factor involved in G, and that the conditions for the
                                             various simple types are as follows.

                                                                                      An    :   no condition,
                                                                           Bn , Cn , Dn     :   p 6= 2,
                                                                        G2 , F4 , E6 , E7   :   p 6= 2, 3,
                                                                                       E8   :   p 6= 2, 3, 5.

                                             For the basic properties of finite groups of Lie type, see [1]. Now we can state:

                                             Theorem 1 Assume that p is a good prime for G. Let χ be an irreducible
                                             character of GF . Then there exists an F -stable parabolic subgroup P ⊆ G and
                                             an irreducible character ψ of UPF (where UP is the unipotent radical of P ) such
                                             that |UPF |/ψ(1) equals the p-part of |GF |/χ(1).

                                                In order to prove this result, we first reduce to the case that G has a con-
                                             nected center. This can be done using regular embeddings (see [6]), as follows.
                                             We can embed G as a closed subgroup into some connected reductive group G′
                                             with a connected center, such that G′ has an Fq -rational structure compatible


                                                                                            1

with that on G and G, G′ have the same derived subgroup. Then we have in
        F           F
fact G′ = GF T ′ for any F -stable maximal torus T ′ ⊆ G′ . In particular, the
             ′F   F
quotient G /G is an abelian p′ -group. Now, if we take any irreducible char-
                F
acter χ′ of G′ then, by Clifford’s Theorem, the restriction of χ′ is of the form
e(χ1 + · · · + χr ) where e ≥ 1 and χ1 , . . . , χr are irreducible characters of GF
                                                  F                         F
which are conjugate under the action of G′ ; moreover, e divides [G′ : GF ].
(In fact, Lusztig [6] has shown that e = 1 but we do not need this highly non-
trivial fact here.) It follows that both e and r are prime to p, and so the terms
    F
|G′ |/χ′ (1) and |GF |/χi (1) (where 1 ≤ i ≤ r) have the same p-part. On the
other hand, the collection of unipotent radicals of F -stable parabolic subgroups
is the same in G and in G′ . Thus, if the above theorem holds for G′ , then it
also holds for G.
    Now let us assume that the center of G is connected, and let χ be an irre-
ducible character of GF . We claim that there exists an F -stable unipotent class
C of G such that
                            q dim Bu is the p-part of χ(1),
where u ∈ C and Bu denotes the variety of Borel subgroups containing u.
This class C can be characterized in two different ways. One could either use
the results in [5, Chap. 13] which describe a map ξG from irreducible char-
acters to unipotent classes in terms of the Springer correspondence. Then
C = ξG (±DG (χ)) where DG denotes Alvis–Curtis–Kawanaka duality, and it
remains to use the formula for χ(1) in [5, (4.26.3)]. Or one uses the fact that
every irreducible character has a unipotent support (see [7] for large p, and [2]
for the extension to good p). Note that here the assumption that p is good is
used, since then the denominator in the formula for χ(1) in [5, (4.26.3)] is not
divisible by p, which is definitely not the case in general.
    Using the theory of weighted Dynkin diagrams, one can associate with an
F -stable unipotent class C two subgroups U2 , U1 ⊆ G such that
 (a) U1 is the unipotent radical of some F -stable parabolic subgroup P ⊆ G,
 (b) U2 is a closed F -stable subgroup of U1 which is normal in P ,
 (c) There exists some u ∈ C ∩ U2 such that the P -orbit of u is dense in U2
     and CG (u) ⊆ P .
If p is large, this can be found in [1, Chap. 5], for example. It has been checked
by Kawanaka [4, Theorem 2.1.1] that these results remain valid whenever p is
a grood prime. Now let u ∈ C ∩ U2 be as in (c). Then, by [4, Lemma 2.1.4], we
have
                     dim CG (u) = dim CP (u) = dim P − dim U2 .
On the other hand, we always have

                    dim P + dim U1 = dim G = 2N + rank G,

where N denotes the number of positive roots in G. Using also the formula
dim CG (u) = rank G + 2 dim Bu (see [10, Cor. 6.5]), we find that

                         2(N − dim Bu ) = dim U1 + dim U2 .

Now Kawanaka [4, §3.1] has shown that there exists a linear character λ of U2F
which is invariant under U1F and such that U1F /kerλ is an extraspecial p-group.
By the character theory of extraspecial p-groups, dim U1 − dim U2 is even and
there exists an irreducible character ψ of U1F which lies above λ and has degree
q (dim U1 −dim U2 )/2 . (Here, we use that if U is any connected unipotent group
defined over Fq , then the fixed point set under the corresponding Frobenius
map has order q dim U .) Using the above formulas this yields that

       |U1F |
              = q dim U1 −(dim U1 −dim U2 )/2 = q (dim U1 +dim U2 )/2 = q N −dim Bu .
       ψ(1)

Since q N is exactly the p-part in |GF |, the proof of Theorem 1 is complete.
Example 1. Let GF = GL3 (q) and χ be of degree q(q + 1). The p-part of
|GF |/χ(1) is q 2 . The unipotent class C associated with χ has Jordan blocks of
sizes 1, 2. The group U1 is the group of all upper triangular unipotent matrices,
U2 is the center of U1 , and for each nontrivial linear character of U2F there
is a unique irreducible character of U1F lying above it. Any such irreducible
character of U1F has degree q.
Example 2. Let GF = Sp4 (q) and χ be of degree 21 q(q 2 + 1). Then the
unipotent support of χ is the unique unipotent class C with dim Bu = 1. (This
holds independently of whether q is a power of a good prime or not; see [3].)
In good characteristic, the subgroups U1 , U2 associated with C are such that
U1 = U2 and |U1F | = q 3 . Analogous subgroups will also exist in characteristic 2,
but we cannot work with them since then the 2-defect of χ is 2q 3 . — This
illustrates some of the difficulty of extending Theorem 1 to the case of bad
characteristic.
