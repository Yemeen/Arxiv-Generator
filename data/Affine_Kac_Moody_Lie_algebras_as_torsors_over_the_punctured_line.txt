                                                  Abstract. We interpret and develop a theory of loop algebras as torsors (principal homoge-
                                                  neous spaces) over Spec (k[t, t−1 ]) . As an application, we recover Kac’s realization of affine
                                                  Kac-Moody Lie algebras.




                                            Introduction. There is a beautiful construction of Victor Kac’s, realizing affine Kac-
                                            Moody Lie algebras over the complex numbers as (twisted) loop algebras. The construction
                                            gives explicit generators for the algebras, which are then shown to satisfy the relations
                                            corresponding to the affine Cartan matrix at hand.
                                                 In this short note, we propose to look at loop algebras in a completely different way.
                                            The basic idea is to view loop algebras as algebras over a ring of Laurent polynomials R,
                                            all of which become isomorphic after a flat covering R → S. Thus loop algebras become
                                            torsors over Spec (R) under the group of automorphisms of the algebra at hand. Since
                                            this point of view applies to arbitrary algebras and base fields, we are able to obtain some
                                            rather general new results about loop algebras in 8 and 10. As an application, we show
                                            how to recover from this Kac’s original result. This is done in 11.
                                                 We begin with a review of loop algebras in 1, and then recall Kac’s construction in
                                            2. This is followed by some abstract results on algebraic groups (3 through 5) which are
                                            later needed. The description of loop algebras as torsors is given in 7.

                                            k-group and X = Spec (R) an affine k-scheme, the X-group G ×Spec (k) X will be denoted
                                            by GX or GR . For an X-group F the Cěch cohomology Ȟ 1 (Xét , F ) on the étale site of
                                            X wil be denoted simply by H 1 (X, F ). For terminology and results about schemes and

     We will throughout work with two copies of k-algebras of Laurent polynomials that
for convenience we denote by

                               R = k[t, t−1 ] and S = k[z, z −1 ].

    For each positive integer m we view the ring S as an R-algebra via t 7→ z m . This
algebra will be denoted by Sm . As usual in what follows ¯ : Z → Z/mZ will denote the
canonical map.
1. Loop algebras. Let A be an algebra over k of a certain “type” (eg. associative, Lie,
Jordan, etc) which we assumed comes equiped with a Z/mZ-grading Σ. Thus


                                         A=      ⊕ Aı̄
                                              0≤i<m

where the Aı̄ are subspaces of A such that Aı̄1 Aı̄2 ⊂ Aı̄1 +ı̄2 . We then define the loop algebra
of A with respect to the given grading Σ by


                     L(A, Σ) := ⊕ Aı̄ ⊗ z i ⊂ A ⊗k k[z, z −1 ] := A ⊗k S.
                                  i∈Z

Note that loop algebras are in a natural way k−algebras of the same type as A (eg. loop
algebras of a Lie algebra are Lie algebras etc.), and are viewed as such in what follows. If
the grading is trivial, namely if A0̄ = A, then L(A, Σ) ≃ A ⊗k R. Loop algebras isomorphic
as k-algebras to A ⊗k R are said to be trivial.
     Suppose now that k is algebraically closed of characteristic 0, and fix a compatible
set ξ = (ξm ) of primitive roots of unity in k (thus if n = cm then ξn c = ξm ). Let σ be
an automorphism of A of period m (we use periods to be able to compare loop algebras
coming from automorphisms of different order). Then A decomposes as the direct sum
of eigenspaces Aı where σ acts on Aı̄ as scalar multiplication by ξm i . We thus obtain a
Z/mZ-grading Σ of A as above. Conversely, any such grading Σ comes from a period m
automorphism σ of A. The resulting loop algebra (which up to R-algebra isomorphism is
independent of the choice of period m of σ) will be denoted by L(A, σ, ξ ), or simply by
L(σ) if A and ξ are fixed. Note that L(idA ) is trivial.
     Here is the most remarkable application of loop algebras.
Theorem 2. Let g be a simple finite dimensional Lie algebra over C, and let − denote
the canonical map from Aut(g) onto the group Out(g) of outer automorphisms of g. Then.
  (i) L(σ) ≃ L(σ) as complex Lie algebras for all σ ∈ Aut(g).
 (ii) Let l̂ be an affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra, and let l be its derived algebra modulo its
      centre. There exists g and π ∈ Out(g) as above such that l ≃ L(π).
(iii) In (ii) above, g is unique up to isomorphism, and π unique up to conjugacy in Out(g).
Proof. Parts (i) and (ii) are due to Kac (see [Kac] Theorem 8.3]). For (iii) one needs the
conjugacy theorem of Peterson and Kac [PK]                                              
                                                2
    Loop algebras are thus concrete realizations of the affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras.
We propose now to give new insight into this theorem, as well as obtain new results about
loop algebras in general, by interpreting such algebras as torsors over the punctured line.
To this end, we begin with some results on the cohomology of algebraic groups.
    The following result shows that the classical vanishing of H 1 theorems of Steinberg and
of Borel and Springer, hold for certain semisimple group schemes over Dedekind domains.
Proposition 3. Let D be a Dedekind domain and K its field of quotients. Set X =
Spec (D). Let G be a quasisplit semisimple connected X-group, B a Borel subgroup of G,
and T a maximal torus of B.
  (i) The natural map H 1 (X, T ) → H 1 (X, G) induces a surjection H 1 (X, T ) → Ker (H 1 (X, G) →
      H 1 (K, GK )). In particular, this kernel is trivial whenever H 1 (X, T ) is trivial.
 (ii) Assume G is semisimple of either adjoint or simply connected type. If all connected
      étale coverings of X have trivial Picard group, then H 1 (X, T ) is trivial.
(iii) Assume G and X are as in (ii). If K is of cohomological dimension 1, then H 1 (X, G)
      is trivial.
(iv) Assume that X and K are as in (iii). If G is split semisimple then the canonical map
      H 1 (X, Aut(G)) → H 1 (X, Out(G)) is bijective.
Proof. (i) This is the extent of Satz 3.2 in [Hrd]. Here is another proof based on an idea
(used in [CTO] in the case of a base field) more in tune with the spirit of this note. A torsor
Y on the kernel in question is rationally trivial, i.e. it admits a section over a non-empty
Zariski open of X. Consider the exact sequence.

                                     1 → B → G → G/B → 1

as well as the contracted product Y ×G G/B. It is clear that the structure morphism
κ : Y ×G G/B → X admits a rational section. Since κ is proper and X is one dimensional
and regular, this section extends to all of X ([EGA] Ch. II Cor. 7.3.6). By [DG] Ch.III
4.4.6 the G-torsor Y comes from B, thence from T given that H 1 (X, radu (B)) = {0}
([SGA3] XXII Cor. 5.9.7). Note that this proof also works in the reductive case. That the
elements of H 1 (X, T ) are rationally trivial is prooved in section 1.4 of [Hrd].
      (ii) By [SGA3] XXIV 3.13-3.15 and [Hrd] 1.4 there exists a finite family of connected
étale coverings Xi /X of X such that
                                             Y
                                      T =         RXi /X (Gm ),
                                              i


where the RXi /X are Weil restrictions. By Shapiro’s lemma one has
                                     Y                       Y
                     H 1 (X, T ) =        H 1 (Xi , Gm ) =       Pic (Xi ) = {0}.
                                      i                      i


    (iii) By classical results of Steinberg and of Borel and Springer H 1 (K, GK ) is trivial.
(See [BS] 8.2, [Stb], and [JPS1] Ch. 3.1 and 3.2 ). Now (iii) follows from (i) and (ii)
                                                   3
    (iv) Recall from [SGA3] XXV the existence of a split exact sequence of X-groups

                          1 → Ad(G) → Aut(G) → Out(G) → 1

The group Out(G) is a finite constant group, and admits a section s : Out(G) → Aut(G)
whose image consists of elements of Aut(G) that stabilize both B and T (We hence-
forth identify Out(G) with a subgroup of Aut(G) by means of this section). Passing to
cohomology yields

                 H 1 (X, Ad(G)) → H 1 (X, Aut(G)) → H 1 (X, Out(G)).

Let Y be an X-torsor under Out(G), and consider the groups Y Ad(G) (resp.Y Ad(B),
Y Ad(T )) obtained from Ad(G) (resp. Ad(B), Ad(T )) by twisting by Y. Being a form of
Ad(G), the group Y Ad(G) is semisimple and of adjoint type as well. It is also quasisplit
by means of (Y Ad(B), Y Ad(T )). By (iii) then, H 1 (X,Y Ad(G)) is trivial. From this it
follows that the map in question is injective. The surjectivity is clear because the existence
of the section s.                                                                           
Note. A priori Y Ad(G) is a sheaf of groups on X. That it is an affine and smooth scheme
over X follows from descent. That its geometric fibers are reductive and connected follows
from the analogous properties for Ad(G). Thus Y Ad(G) is a reductive group in the sense
of [SGA3]. Along similar lines Y Ad(B) is a Borel subgroup . . .

    The following result shows that the assumption on étale coverings made in part (ii)
of Proposition 3, holds in a crucial case.
Proposition 4. (P. Gille) Assume k is of characteristic 0. Every connected finite étale
covering of Spec (k[t, t−1 ]) has trivial Picard group.
Proof. Let Y → X := Spec (k[t, t−1 ]) be one such covering. Fix an element x ∈ X(k). From
[SGA1] Exp. IX Th. 6.3.1 together with a Theorem of Grauert-Remmert ([SGA4] Exp. XI
Th. 4.3), as well as from [SGA1] Exp. XIII Cor. 2.12, it follows that the fundamental group
Π1 (X, x) is the semidirect product (inv lim µn (ks )) ⋊ Gal(ks /k), where the µn come from
the Kummer coverings. There thus exists a positive integer m, a finite Galois field extension
L/k containing a primitive m-th root of unity, and a subgroup Γ of µm (L) ⋊ Gal(L/k),
such that Y = Y0 /Γ where Y0 is the k–variety defined by the morphism Y0 = XL →
Spec (L) → Spec (k). As the morphism Y0 → Y is a Galois covering, the beginning of the
Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence E2p,q = H p (Γ, H q (Y0 , Gm )) =⇒ H p+q (Y, Gm ) yields an
exact sequence

                 0 → H 1 (Γ, H 0 (Y0 , Gm )) → H 1 (Y, Gm ) → H 1 (Y0 , Gm )Γ .

     Since H 1 (Y0 , Gm ) = Pic (Y0 ) = {0}, we get an isomorphism H 1 (Γ, H 0 (Y0 , Gm )) ≃
Pic (Y ). One has an exact sequence of Γ–modules (and of µm (L) ⋊ Gal(L/k)–modules)

                             0 → L× → H 0 (Y0 , Gm ) → Z → 0,
                                               4
where Z has trivial Γ–action. By Hilbert’s theorem 90 one has H 1 (Γ, L× ) = {0}, and as
Γ is finite, one also has H 1 (Γ, Z) = {0}. Thus H 1 (Γ, H 0 (Y0 , Gm )) = {0} and therefore
Pic (Y ) = {0} as desired.                                                                
    Part (i) of the next result is an easy, but useful generalization of a result of [CTO].
Proposition 5. Let k be an infinite perfect field and let G be a smooth connected linear
algebraic k-group. Let X be a nonempty open subscheme of Spec (k[t]) = A1 . Then.
 (i) The canonical map H 1 (X, GX ) → H 1 (k(t), Gk(t) ) has trivial kernel.
(ii) H 1 (X, GX ) is trivial in the following three cases.
     (a) If H 1 (k(t), Gk(t) ) is trivial.
     (b) If k is algebraically closed and of characteristic 0.
     (c) If k is algebraically closed and G is reductive.
Proof. Let us begin by showing that every Zariski G-torsor over X (i.e. a torsor that can
be trivialized by a Zariski covering of X) extends to A1 (this much holds for any group
scheme G). Indeed. The underlying space of X is obtained by removing a finite set F
of points from the affine line. Let now Y be a Zariski G-torsor over X. Let U be the
intersection of a finite number of non empty open subschemes of X that cover X, and over
which Y is trivial. Finally, let Z be the trivial G-torsor over the open subscheme of A1
corresponding to U ∪ F . Then by gluing Y with Z along U we obtain a torsor over A1 as
desired.
      (i) By reasoning as in Théorème 2.1 of [CTO] we may assume that G is reductive
and connected. A Theorem of Nisnevich [Nsn] then shows that the kernel of the map in
question is comprised precisely of Zariski G-torsors over X. But we have seen that any
such torsor extends to the full affine line. Now (i) follows from [CTO] Corollaire 2.3 which
asserts that (i) does hold for A1 .
      (ii) By the theorems of Steinberg and Borel-Springer mentioned above, H 1 (k(t), Gk(t) )
is trivial under the assumptions of either (b) or (c). Thus (b) and (c) reduce to (a), and
this last holds by (i).                                                                    
Remark 6. Assume that k contains a primitive m-th root of unity. Then the finite
covering Spec (Sm ) → Spec (R) is étale and in fact Galois, with Galois group Γ ≃ Z/mZ
(see 7 infra). Assume now that we are under one of the cases of Proposition 5 (ii). Then
the usual non-abelian cohomology H 1 (Γ, G(Sm )) vanishes. If k = C and G is semisimple,
we recover the observation made in [Kac] §8.9.

7. Loop algebras as torsors. We return now to our general setup of 1 and consider
an arbitrary k-algebra A, together with Z/mZ-grading Σ. For convenience we henceforth
denote Spec (R) := Spec (k[t, t−1 ]) by X and Spec (S) := Spec (k[z, z −1 ]) by Y
     The loop algebra L(Σ) = L(A, Σ) is naturally an R-algebra, and it is not hard to
show that L(Σ) ⊗R Sm ≃ A ⊗k S as S-algebras (see [ABP]). In other words, L(Σ) is an
Sm /R-form of A ⊗k R. Since Sm /R is faithfully flat and finitely presented (fppf), L(Σ)
is an Aut(AX )-torsor over X. In this context, Aut(AX ) stands for the sheaf of groups
on the flat site of X that attaches to X ′ /X, the group of O(X ′ )-algebra automorphism of
A ⊗k O(X ′ ) of the same type as A.
                                              5
      The isomorphism class of the R−algebra L(Σ) is thus an element of H 1 (Xfppf , Aut(AX ))
that we denote by L1 (Σ). To say that L1 (Σ1 ) = L1 (Σ2 ) is to say that L(Σ1 ) and L(Σ2 )
are isomorphic as algebras over R. It is clear then that L(Σ1 ) and L(Σ2 ) are a fortiori
isomorphic as algebras over k. The converse does not hold in general, but as we shall see
in 10 and 11 , it does hold in some very interesting cases.
      Next we assume that the base field k is algebraically closed and of characterist zero,
and go on to describe explicitly how to construct L1 (σ) from σ. The finite covering Y →
X is étale and in fact Galois. Its Galois group Γ can be identifyed with Z/mZ where
1 + mZ acts on S via t → ξt. This leads to a natural action of Γ on the abstract group
of automorphisms AutA ⊗k S := Aut(AX )(Y ) of the S-algebra A ⊗k S. The map u : n +
mZ 7→ σ −n is clearly a 1-cocycle in Z 1 (Γ, Aut(AX )(Y )) = Z 1 ((Y /X)fppf, Aut(AX )), and
a straightforward computation shows that the form corresponding to u is precisely L(σ). To
obtain then L1 (σ) we simply follow u along the canonical maps Z 1 ((Y /X)fppf , Aut(AX )) →
H 1 ((Y /X)fppf, Aut(AX )) ⊂ H 1 (Xfppf , Aut(AX ))
    Kac’s theorem states that for complex simple Lie algebras, the isomorphism class of a
covering algebra L(σ) depends only on the outer part of σ. In addition, if σ is inner then
L(σ) is trivial. The following two Propositions show this to be a particular instance of a
rather general picture.
Proposition 8. Let k be an infinite perfect field. Assume that the k-algebra A is finite
dimensional, and that the linear algebraic k-group Aut(A) is smooth and connected. If
either of the conditions of Proposition 5 (ii) hold, then all loop algebras of A are trivial.
Proof. By 7, it suffices to show that H 1 (Xfppf , Aut(AX )) is trivial. Since Aut(AX ) is
smooth, we may replace the fppf by the étale topology. Now apply Proposition 5 (ii). 

Example 9. If A is the associative unital algebra of n by n matrices with entries in an
algebraically closed field k, then all its covering algebras are trivial. Indeed. Aut(A) ≃
PGLn .
Proposition 10. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Assume that the
k-algebra A is finite dimensional, and that the linear algebraic k-group Aut(A) coincides
with the group of automorphisms Aut(G) of some semisimple algebraic k-group G of either
adjoint or simply connected type. Set X = Spec k[t, t−1 ]. Then there exists a canonical
bijection between the following four sets:
 (1) H 1 (X, Aut(GX ))
 (2) H 1 (X, Out(GX ))
 (3) Conjugacy classes of the (abstract) finite group Out(G) := Out(G)(k).
 (4) Isomorphism classes in R-alg of loop algebras of A.
In particular, all these sets are finite. If in addition in the group Out(G) all elements are
conjugate to their inverses, and if the centroid of all loop algebras of A coincides with R,
then (4) above is equivalent to
 (5) Isomorphism classes in k-alg of loop algebras of A.
Proof. (1) ≃ (2). This was established in Theorem 3 (iv).
(2) ≃ (3). Let E be the set of continuous group homomorphisms from the fundamental
group Π(X, x) into Out(G). Clearly Out(G) acts on E by conjugation. Since Out(GX )
                                              6
is finite and constant, H 1 (X, Out(GX )) can be computed as the quotient set E/Out(G)
[SGA1]. Now from Proposition 4 we know that Π(X, x) ≃ inv lim Z/nZ. It follows that the
elements of E can be identified in a natural way with elements of Out(G), and that then two
elements of E are equivalent under the action of Out(G) if and only if the corresponding
elements of Out(G) are conjugate.
      (3) ≃ (4). First note that since we are in characteristic 0 all loop algebras are of the
form L(σ) for some σ ∈ Aut(A) = Aut(A)(k) = Aut(G)(k). The correspondence assigns
to the R-isomorphism class of L(σ) the conjugacy class of σ. That such map exists and is
bijective follows from the interpretation of the L(σ)’s as torsors, the explicit construction
of L1 (σ) given in 7, and Proposition 3(iv).
     Assume now that A above is such that in the group Out(G) all elements are conjugate
to their inverses, and also such that the centroid Z of all the L(σ)’s (viewed as k-algebras)
coincide with R (namely Z = k[z m , z −m ] ≃ R where m is a chosen period of σ). We must
show that if two loop algebras L(σ 1 ) and L(σ 2 ) are isomorphic as k-algebras then they are
isomorphic as R-algebras. Since all the isomorphism classes in question do not depend on
the choice of period, we may assume that both σ 1 and σ 2 have period m. We now reason
as in [ABP]. Fix a k-algebra isomorphism ψ between L(σ 1 ) and L(σ 2 ). Then ψ induces an
automorphism ψZ of the centroid Z of L(σ 1 ). There are two “types” of automorphisms of
Z ≃ R: those that do not interchange kt and kt−1 , and those which do . The upshot of
this is that L(σ 1 ) is isomorphic as an R-algebra to either L(σ2 ) or L(σ2−1 ) depending on
the type of ψZ .
     Having establish this, we appeal to (3) ≃ (4) to conclude that σ 1 and σ 2 are conjugate
(because in Out(G) elements are conjugate to their inverses), and hence that L(σ 1 ) and
L(σ 2 ) are isomorphic as R-algebras (again by (3) ≃ (4)).                                 
    We can now recover the parts of Theorem 2 concerning loop algebras.
Corollary 11. Let g be a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed
field k of characteristic 0. Let σ1 and σ2 be two automorphisms of g of finite order. For
L(σ1 ) to be isomorphic to L(σ2 ) as algebras over k, it is necessary and sufficient that σ 1
and σ 2 be conjugate in Out(g).
Proof. Let G be the simply connected Chevalley-Demazure group corresponding to g. Then
Aut(GX ) ≃ Aut(gX ) with Out(G) corresponding to Out(g) ([SGA3] XXV). Furthermore
Out(G) is the group of automorphisms of the corresponding Dynkin diagram, and one
knows that in these groups all elements are conjugate to their inverses. That the centroids
of the loop algebras of g coincide with R is easy to check (see [ABP] for details).      
Remark 12 It is natural to ask if Proposition 10 holds for symmetrizable Kac-Moody
Lie algebras. We look at this problem in [ABP], and make good progress by using the
Gantmacher-like decomposition of automorphisms described in [KW].
      It would be interesting to know if the answer to this question can be had by purely
cohomological methods (as the finite dimensional case here as well as [Pzl1] and [Pzl2]
seem to suggest is possible). The abstract construction of section 7 applies, but the real
difficulty of course comes when one tries to recreate Proposition 3 for the various group
schemes attached to Kac-Moody algebras (See [Tts]). This appears to be a very difficult
question, but in the affine case at least, progress should be possible.
