    mann–Segal–Fock space of holomorphic entire functions on Cn×k which are
    also square-integrable with respect to µ. Fix n and let Fn×∞ denote the
    Hilbert-space completion of the inductive limit limk→∞ Fn×k . Let Gk and
    Hk be compact groups suchSthat Hk ⊂ Gk S      ⊂ GLk (C). Let G∞ (resp. H∞ )
    denote the inductive limit ∞   k=1 Gk (resp.

    Fn×∞ , is a holomorphic representation of G∞ (resp. H∞ ) in the sense de-
    fined by Ol’shanskii. Then RG∞ and RH∞ give rise to the dual representations
    R′G′ and R′H ′ of the dual pairs (G′n , G∞ ) and (Hn′ , H ), respectively. The

                                     1. Introduction
    In recent years there is great interest, both in Physics and in Mathematics, in
the theory of unitary representations of infinite-dimensional groups and their Lie
algebras (see, for example, [Ka1], and the literature cited therein). Starting with the
seminal work of I. Segal in [Se] the representation theory of U (∞) and other classical
infinite-dimensional groups was thoroughly investigated by Kirillov in [Ki], Stratila
and Voiculescu in [S&V], Pickrell in [Pi], Ol’shanskii in [Ol1], Gelfand and Graev
in [Ge&Gr], Kac in [Ka2], to cite just a few. A more complete list of references can
be found in the comprehensive and important work of Ol’shanskii in [Ol2].
    In [Ol2] Ol’shanski generalized Howe’s theory of dual pairs to some infinite-
dimensional dual pairs of groups. Recently in [TT1] and [TT2] we investigated the
generalized Casimir invariants of these infinite-dimensional dual pairs. In [TT3] we
gave a general reciprocity theorem for finite-dimensional dual pairs of groups which
generalized our previous results in [KT1] and [LT1]. In this article we give a gen-
eralization of this reciprocity theorem to the case of dual pairs where one member
is infinite-dimensional and the other is finite-dimensional, and discuss the general
case where both members are infinite-dimensional. If Section 2 we will review the
reciprocity theorem given in [TT3] which serves as the necessary background for the
generalized theorem, and more importantly, discuss several interesting applications
of this theorem. Section 3 deals with our main theorem, and the paper ends with
a short conclusion in Section 4.

2. The Reciprocity Theorem for Finite-Dimensional Pairs of Groups
                        and Its Applications
   In [TT3] our reciprocity theorem can be applied to the more general context of
dual representations but for this paper we shall restrict ourself to the case of the
oscillator dual representations and where one of the members is a compact group.
   Let Cn×k denote the vector space of all n × k complex matrices. Let µ denote
the Gaussian measure on Cn×k defined by
                                            
(2.1)           dµ (Z) = π −nk exp − Tr ZZ † dZ,         Z ∈ Cn×k ,
where in Eq. (2.1) Z † denotes the adjoint of the matrix Z and dZ denotes the
Lebesgue measure on Cn×N . Let Fn×k ≡ F Cn×k denote the Bargmann–Segal–
Fock space of all holomorphic entire functions on Cn×k which are also square-
integrable with respect to dµ. Endowed with the inner product
                         Z
(2.2)          (f g) =         f (Z) g (Z) dµ (Z) ;  f, g ∈ Fn×k ,
                             Cn×k
Fn×k has a Hilbert-space structure. It can be easily verified that the inner product
                                                
(2.3)                       hf gi = f (D) g Z̄ |Z=0
where f (D) denotes the formal power series obtained by replacing Zαj by the
partial derivative ∂/∂Zαj (1 ≤ α ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ k). In fact if (r) = (r11 , . . . , rnk )
                                                     r11         rnk
is a multi-index of integers rαj ≥ 0 let Z (r) ≡ Z11      · · · Znk  and (r)! = r11 ! · · · rnk !
then it is easy to verify that
                                       ! *                      +

It follows immediately from Eq. (2.4) that Z (r) [(r)!] 2       forms an orthonormal

the subspace of all polynomial functions on Cn×k , is dense in Fn×k .
   Let G and G′ be two topological groups. Let RG and RG    ′
                                                              ′ be continuous unitary

and completely (discretely) reducible representations of G and G′ on Fn×k such that
          ′
RG and RG   ′ commute. Then we have the following definition of dual representations

(for the definition of dual representations in a more general context see [TT3]).
                                             ′                                ′
Definition 2.1. The representations RG and RG   ′ are said to be dual if the G × G-

module Fn×k is decomposed into a multiplicity-free orthogonal direct sum of the
form
                                     X      (λ)
(2.5)                        Fn×k =     ⊕ In×k ,
                                            (λ)

where in Eq. (2.5) the label (λ) characterizes both an equivalence class of an irre-
ducible unitary representation λG of G and an equivalence class of an irreducible
                             (λ)
representation λ′G′ , and In×k denotes the (λ)-isotypic component, i.e., the direct
                                                                                 ′
sum (not canonical) of all irreducible subrepresentations of RG (resp. RG          ′ ) that
                                                 ′                     ′
belong to the equivalence class λG (resp. λG′ ). Moreover the G × G-submodule
  (λ)                                              (λ)
                                                                 ˆ W (λG′ ) , where V (λG )
                                                                        ′
In×k is irreducible for all signatures (λ); i.e., In×k ≈ V (λG ) ⊗
(resp. W (λG′ ) ) is an irreducible G-module of class (λ ) (resp. G′ -module of class
            ′

(λ′G′ )).
   We refer to the decomposition (2.5) as the canonical decomposition of the G′ ×G-
module Fn×k .
   In this context we have the following theorem which is a special case of Theorem
4.1 in [TT3].
                                                           ′
Theorem 2.2. Let G be a compact group. Let RG and RG         ′ be given dual represen-

tations on Fn×k . Let H be a compact subgroup of G and let RH be the representation
of H on Fn×k obtained by restricting RG to H. If there exists a group H ′ ⊃ G′ and
                   ′                       ′                          ′
a representation RH  ′ on Fn×k such that RH ′ is dual to RH and RG′ is the restric-
          ′                    ′      ′
tion of RH ′ to the subgroup G of H then we have the following multiplicity-free
decompositions of Fn×k into isotypic components
                                 X      (λ)
                                                X      (µ)
(2.6)                     Fn×k =     ⊕ In×k =      ⊕ In×k
                                     (λ)            (µ)

where (λ) is a common irreducible signature of the pair (G′ , G) and (µ) is a common
irreducible signature of the pair (H ′ , H).
   If λG (resp. λ′G′ ) denotes an irreducible unitary representation of class (λ)
and µH (resp. µ′H ′ ) denotes an irreducible unitary representation of class (µ)
then the multiplicity dim [HomH (µH : λG |H )] of the irreducible representation
µH in the restriction to H of the representation λG is equal to the multiplicity
dim [HomG′ (λ′G′ : µ′H ′ |G′ )] of the irreducible representation λ′G′ in the restriction
to G′ of the representation µ′H ′ .
Remarks. In many cases HomH (µ : λG |H ) and HomG (λ′G : µ′H ′ |G ) are shown to
be isomorphic and can be explicitly constructed in terms of generalized Casimir
operators as given in [KT2] and [LT2].

examples and discuss their generalization.
Examples 2.3. 1) Consider F1×k with k ≥ 2; then F1×k is the classical Barg-

G′ = U (1); then the complexification of U (k) (resp. U (1)) is GC = GLk (C) (resp.
G′C = GL1 (C)). An element f of F1×k is of the form

   It follows that RG , G = U (k) (resp. RG    ′ , G = U (n)) is a continuous unitary

representation of G (resp. G′ ) on Fn×k .
          (m)
   Let P1×k denote the subspace (of F1×k ) of all homogeneous polynomial func-
tions of degree m ≥ 0. Then by the Borel–Weil theorem (see, e.g., [TT4]) the
                           (m)
restriction of RGC to P1×k is an irreducible subrepresentation of RGC with highest
weight (m, 0, . . . , 0) and highest weight vector cZ1m , c ∈ C∗ . In fact, by letting
          | {z }

the infinitesimal operators Rij act on P1×k one can easily show that P1×k is an
irreducible subrepresentation of RGC . By “Weyl’s unitarian trick” the restriction of
this irreducible subrepresentation to G gives an irreducible unitary representation
of G.                                                        

   Let 0 6= p ∈ P1×k . Then (RG    ′ (g ) p) (Z) = p  (g ′ ) Z = p (g ′ Z) = (g ′ ) p (Z)
for all g ′ ∈ GL1 (C). So the one-dimensional subspace of F1×k spanned by p is an
irreducible G′C -submodule with highest weight (m) and its restriction to G′ is an
irreducible unitary G′ -submodule. In fact, Euler’s formula implies that
                                                         (m)

Thus the canonical decomposition of the G′ × G-module F1×k is simply

Let H denote the special orthogonal subgroup SO (k). Then HC = SOk (C). Then
the ring of all H
                P (or HC )-invariant polynomials in P1×k is generated by the constants
and p0 (Z) = 1≤i≤k Zi2 . The ring of all H (or HC )-invariant differential operators
with constant
           P coefficients is generated by the constants and the Laplacian △ =
p0 (D) = 1≤i≤k ∂ 2 /∂Zi2 . To find the dual representation of RH we follow the
method given in [TT3] by setting

Then X + (resp. X − ) acts on F1×k as a creation (resp. annihilation) operator and E
                                                       (m)
acts on F1×k as a number operator. In fact, if p ∈ P1×k then X + p = 21 p0 p, X − p =

Eq. (2.19) gives a faithful representation of the Lie algebra sl2 (R). Thus the dual
action of H is given by this representation. The integrated form of this Lie algebra
representation is more subtle to describe: it is the metaplectic representation of the

matrix group. Its concrete description can be obtained by applying the Bargmann–
Segal transform which sends the Schrödinger representation of this group to its
Fock representation F1×k . However, for our purpose, its infinitesimal action (2.19)
together with the action of its maximal compact group G′ = U (1), which is par-
ticularly simple, will suffice. Indeed, it is easy to show that we have the following
                    (m)
decomposition of P1×k :
                                     (m)

For each integer j ≥ 0, the restriction of RH to the subspace pj0 H(r) is equivalent

In general, if a holomorphic discrete series of a noncompact semisimple Lie group
such as SL ^2 (R) considered as a K-module, where K is its maximal compact sub-
group, decomposes into a discrete sum of irreducible submodules, each one of them
can be characterized by a signature (highest weight, for example) and the one with
the lowest highest weight (under the lexicographic ordering) is unique. This low-
est K-type highest weight which corresponds to the Harish Chandra’s or Blattner’s
parameter, can be used to label the given holomorphic discrete series. We shall
call this label its signature. In our example,

SL 2 (R) has  signature r. If dim   H 1×r   = d (actually, d = k+r−1
                                                                 r    − k+r−3

is the r-isotypic component (of the metaplectic representation of SL           ^ 2 (R)) which
contains d isomorphic copies of signature r.

(see Eq. (3.3)) that {Eαβ , Pαβ , Dαβ } defines a faithful representation of sp2n (R)
on Fn×k . By construction this representation is dual to the infinitesimal action
of RH . The global action R′ ′ is a unitary metaplectic representation of Sp^

   An element p of Pn×k is called H-harmonic if △αβ p = 0 for all α, β = 1, . . . , n.
Let Hn×k denote the subspace of all H-harmonic polynomial functions of Pn×k and
let Hn×k (µ) denote the subspace of all elements h of Hn×k which also satisfy the
covariant condition

Then according to Theorem 3.1 of [TT4], the representation RH of H which is
obtained by right translations on Hn×k (µ) is irreducible with signature (µ).

By Corollary 3.11 of [TT4] the µ-isotypic component in Hn×k consists of dµ copies
isomorphic to Hn×k (µ), where dµ is the degree of an irreducible representation of
G′ = U (n) of signature (µ1 , . . . , µn ). Since from Eq. (2.40) and the fact that fµ is

H-harmonic

                       Dµν Eαβ fµ = [Dµν , Eαβ ] fµ + Eαβ Dµν fµ

                                    = δαµ Dβν fµ + δαν Dβµ fµ

                                    = 0,
                                                                                h       i
                                                                                      H
it follows that Eαβ fµ is H-harmonic for every α, β = 1, . . . , n. Since Eαβ , Rij       =0
for all α, β = 1, . . . , n and i, j = 1, . . . , k it follows that Eαβ : Hn×k (µ) → Hn×k are
intertwining operators, and thus are either 0 or isomorphisms. It follows that the g′ -
module generated by the cyclic vector fµ is irreducible with signature (µ1 , . . . , µn ).
In fact, from Eq. (3.14) of [TT4] this space is a G′ -module. Let G′ fµ denote this
G′ -module; then by construction G′ fµ ⊂ Hn×k .
    If h ∈ G′ fµ then from Eq. (2.40) we have

              Dµν Pαβ h = [Dµν , Pαβ ] h + Pαβ Dµν h

                         = − (δαµ Eνβ + δαν Eµβ + δβµ Eνα + δβν Eµν ) h,

and therefore Dµν Pαβ h belongs to G′ fµ . It follows that Jn×k G′ fµ is an irreducible
                                            ′                                      (µ)
sp2n (R)-module with signature (µ). Let Hn×k      (µ) denote this module and let In×k
           ′
be the H × H-cyclic module generated by fµ ; then a proof similar to the case
  (λ)                                                        (µ)
In×k shows that Hn×k′       ˆ Hn×k (µ) is isomorphic to In×k
                        (µ) ⊗                                    . By the “separation
of variables theorem” 2.5 of [TT4] and from the fact that Pn×k is dense in Fn×k
                                                                      P      (µ)
it follows that the orthogonal direct sum decomposition Fn×k = ⊕ In×k holds.
                                                                          (µ)
Therefore the reciprocity theorem 2.2 holds for these pairs (G′ , G) and (H ′ , H) as
well.
2) Let k = 2l and consider again the dual pair (G′ = U (n) , G = U (k)). Let
H =Sp(k); then HC =Spk (C). If l ≥ n ≥ 2 then the theory of symplectic harmonic
polynomials in [TT5] implies that the dual representation to the representation RH
on Fn×k is a representation of the group SO∗ (2n) = H ′ whose infinitesimal action
is given by Eq. (4.2) of [KLT]. Using Theorem 2.1 of [TT5] and the “separation of
                                                                      P     (µ)
variables theorem” for this case we can show similarly that Fn×k = ⊕ In×k for
                                                                                (µ)
this dual pair (SO∗ (2n) , Sp (k)). Thus the reciprocity theorem 2.2 holds again for
these pairs (G′ , G) and (H ′ , H).
3) The case of the dual pairs (G′ = U (p) × U (q) , G = U (k) × U (k)) and
(H ′ = U (p, q) , H = U (k)) can be treated in a similar fashion using the results
of [TT6] and the infinitesimal action of H ′ on Fn×k is given by Eq. (6.4) of [TT3].
However, its generalization to the case H = U (∞) in Section 3 is quite delicate
and requires a quite different embedding that we shall describe in detail below.
   Let p and q be positive integers such that p+q = n. Let k be an integer such that
k ≥ 2 max (p, q). Let (λ) be a q-tuple of integers such that λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λq ≥ 0.

   Let H = {(g, g) : g ∈ U (k)}; then H is isomorphic to U (k) and H acts on Fn×q

Together with the infinitesimal action of GLn (C) on Fn×k the pαβ ’s and △αβ ’s
generate a Lie algebra isomorphic to su(p, q) with commutation relations given
by Eq. (6.4) in [TT3]. The global action of this infinitesimal action defines a

that the orthogonal direct sum decomposition Fn×k = ⊕ In×k holds. Therefore

the reciprocity theorem 2.2 also holds for these pairs (G′ , G) and (H ′ , H).

4) This example is a generalization of the previous example. Consider r copies of
one of the following groups: U (k), SO (k), or Sp(k), with k even for the last, and
let each of them act on a Bargmann–Segal–Fock space Fpi ×k , 1 ≤ i ≤ r, by right
translations. Let p1 + p2 + · · · + pr = n, and let G denote the direct product of
r copies of each type of group. In the case of U (k) we allow the rth copy to act
on Fp2 ×k either directly or contragrediently; for the other cases it is not necessary
to consider the contragredient representations since they are identical to the direct
representations.
   On each Fpi ×k for the U (k) action we have the dual action of U (pi ) by left
translations, and with possibly the dual (left) contragredient representation in the
case i = r. For SO (k) we have the metaplectic representation of Sp          ]  2pi (R), and for
Sp(k) we have the corresponding representation of SO∗ (2pi ). Let G′ denote the dual
group of G thus obtained. Let H denote the diagonal subgroup of G; then in the case
of U (k) an element of H is of the form (u, u, . . . , u) or (u, . . . , u, ū), u ∈ U (k), and
                                         | {z }               | {z }
                                                           r                   r−1
in other cases an element of H is of the form (u, u, . . . , u), u ∈ SO (k) or u ∈Sp(k).
                                               | {z }
                                                                  r
Let H ′ denote the dual group of H thus obtained. Then H ′ is isomorphic in each
                ]
case to U (n), Sp               ∗
                  2n (R), or SO (2n). As in previous examples it is straightforward
to verify that the reciprocity theorem 2.2 holds for these pairs (G′ , G) and (H ′ , H).



 3. Reciprocity Theorems for Finite-Infinite Dimensional Dual Pairs
                             of Groups
   Let H be an infinite-dimensional separable complex Hilbert space with a fixed
basis {e1 , e2 , . . . , ek , . . . }. Let GLk (C) denote the group of all invertible bounded
linear operators on H which leave the vectors en , n > k, fixed. We define GL∞ (C)
as the inductive limit of the ascending chain of subgroups

                             GL1 (C) ⊂ · · · ⊂ GLk (C) ⊂ · · · .
16                                     TUONG TON-THAT


Thus

     GL∞ (C) = {A = (aij ) , i, j ∈ N | A is invertible
                                         and all but a finite number of aij − δij are 0}.
If for each k we have a Lie subgroup Gk of GLk (C) such that Gk is naturally
embedded S   in Gk+1 , k = 1, . . . , n, . . . , then wecan define the inductive 	 limit G∞ =
              ∞                                                            ∗     −1
lim
−→  G k =     k=1 G k . For  example,        U   (∞) =   u ∈ GL  ∞ (C) : u   = u      , and thus
U (∞) is the inductive limit of the groups Uk of all unitary operators of H which
leave the vectors en , n > k, fixed.
   Following Ol’shanskii we call a unitary representation of G∞ tame if it is con-
tinuous

               , k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , constitutes a fundamental system of neighborhoods
     0 ∗
of the identity 1∞ . Assume that for each k a continuous unitary representation
(Rk , Hk ) is given and an isomorphic embedding ikk+1 : Hk → Hk+1 commuting with
the action of Gk (i.e., ikk+1 ◦ Rk (g) = Rk+1 (g) ◦ ikk+1 ) is given. For j ≤ k define the
connecting map ϕjk : Gj × Hj → Gk × Hk by
(3.1)                ϕjk (gj , xj ) = (gk , xk ) ,        (gj , xj ) ∈ Gj × Hj ,
where in Eq. (3.1) gk (resp. xk ) denotes the natural embedding of gj (resp. xj ) in
Gk (resp. Hk ). Then obviously the diagram

is commutative. Let H∞ denote the Hilbert-space completion of                                 k=1   Hk and
define a representation R∞ of G∞ on Hk by
(3.3)                R∞ (g) x = Rk (g) x             if g ∈ Gk and x ∈ Hk .
                                                                        S∞
Then obviously R∞ is a unique continuous unitary representation of G∞ on k=1 Hk
which can be extended to a unique continuous unitary representation of G∞ on
H∞ . Let ϕk denote the canonical map of (Gk , Hk ) into (G∞ , H∞ ) and ik denote
the canonical map of Hk into H∞ ; then obviously the diagram
                                                     Rk

                                    G∞ × H∞          −→ H∞
is commutative.
   The following theorem, which is well-known when ikk+1 is an isometric embedding
(see, e.g., [Ol2]), is crucial for what follows.
Theorem 3.1. If the representations (Rk , Hk ) are all irreducible then the inductive
limit representation (R∞ , H∞ ) is also irreducible.

Proof. Let A be a bounded operator on H∞ which belongs to the commutant    S∞       of
the algebra of operators generated by the set {R∞ (g) , g ∈ G∞ }. Since k=1 Hk is
dense in H∞ and all the linear operators involved
                                            S     are continuous we can without  loss
of generality consider them as operating on ∞     H k and  satisfying A i k
                                                                            (x)  = Ax
                                              k=1                  S∞ l
for k ≤ l and for all x ∈ Hk . Let Pk denote the projection of k=1 Hk onto Hk .
Let Ak denote
            S∞ the restriction of A to Hk ; then Ak is a bounded linear operator
of Hk into n=1 Hn . It follows immediately that Pk Ak : Hk → Hk is a bounded
linear operator on Hk . Let x ∈ Hk and suppose Ak x = Ax belongs to Hl . If l ≤ k
we may use the isomorphic embedding ilk = ikk−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ill+1 : Hl → Hk to identify
Ax with an element of Hk so that Pk Ak x = Ak x = Ax, and thus
    Rk (gk ) Pk Ak x = R∞ (gk ) Ax = AR∞ (gk ) x = Pk Rk (gk ) x,        ∀ gk ∈ Gk .
If l > k then use ikl to identify Hk with a subspace of Hl . Write Ax = y + z
where y belongs to the identified subspace of Hk and z belongs to its orthogonal
complement in Hl . Since all representations are unitary and for gk ∈ Gk we have
ikl ◦ Rk (gk ) = Rl (gk ) ◦ ikl it follows that
                  Pk R∞ (gk ) Ak x = Pk Rk (gk ) y = R∞ (gk ) Pk Ax.
By assumption R∞ (gk ) Ax = AR∞ (gk ) x, therefore

  Rk (gk ) Pk Ak x = R∞ (gk ) Pk Ax
                            = Pk R∞ (gk ) Ak x = Pk Ak R∞ (gk ) x = Pk Ak Rk (gk ) x.
Since this relation holds for all x ∈ Hk and gk ∈ Gk it follows that Pk Ak be-
longs to the commutant of the algebra of operators on Hk generated by the set
{Rk (gk ) , gk ∈ Gk }. Schur’s lemma for operator algebras (see, e.g., [Di, Proposi-
tion 2.3.1, p. 39]) implies that Pk Ak = λk Ik , where λk is a scalar depending on
k and Ik is the identity operator on Hk . Now A is a map of inductive limit sets
such that Pk Ak : Hk → Hk , and it follows from the definition of an inductive limit
map that λk = λl for sufficiently large k, l with k < l. Indeed, if x ∈ Hk and
Ak x = Ax ∈ Hj with j ≤ k then Pk Ak x = ijk (Ax) = λk x. For l > k we then have
                                           
   λl ikl (x) = Pl Al ikl (x) = Pl A ikl (x) = Pl Ax
                                                       
                               = ijl (Ax) = ikl ijk (Ax) = ikl (Pk Ak (x)) = λk ikl (x) .

On the other hand, if Ax ∈ Hj with j > k then for all l ≥ j we have
                                                       
  Pl Al ikl (x) = Pl A ikl (x) = Pl Ax = Pl Aj ikj (x)
                                                                       
      = Pl Pj Aj ikj (x) = Pl λj ikj (x) = ijl λj ikj (x) = λj ijl ikj (x) = λj ikl (x) .
                   
Since Pl Al ikl (x) = λl ikl (x), we must have λj = λl for all l ≥ j. This implies that
A = λI∞ where λ ∈ C is a constant and I∞ is the identity on H∞ . By the same
Schur’s lemma quoted above the representation R∞ on H∞ must be irreducible.

   Now fix n and consider the chain of Hilbert spaces Fn×k from Section 2 with
k > 2n. Let (G′n , Gk ) denote a dual pair of groups with dual representations
(Rn′ , Rk ) acting on Fn×k as in Theorem 2.2. Then we have the chain of embedded
subgroups Gk ⊂ Gk+1 ⊂ · · · ; for example, U (k) is naturally embedded in U (k + 1)
via the embedding u → ( u0 01 ), u ∈ U (k). Therefore we can define the inductive limit
18                                          TUONG TON-THAT

                S∞                                           k
G∞ = lim
      −→ Gk = k>2n Gk . We also have an isometric embedding ik+1 : Fn×k →
Fn×(k+1) such that

                                  ikk+1 ◦ Rk (g) = Rk+1 (g) ◦ ikk+1 .
To see this we take the case n = 1: then an element f of Fn×k is a function
of Z = (Z1 , . . . , Zk ) of the form given by Eq. (2.7), and the verification of the
equation
    S∞ above is straightforward. Let Fn×∞ denote the Hilbert-space completion
on k>2n Fn×k . Then it is clear that the inductive limit representation R∞ of G∞
on Fn×∞ is tame and satisfies the relations (3.2), (3.3), and (3.4).
   If Gk is a compact group then every irreducible unitary representation of Gk
is of the form (ρλk , Vλk ) with highest weight (λk ) = (m1 , m2 , . . . , mi , . . . ), where
m1 , m2 , . . . are nonnegative integers satisfying m1 ≥ m2 ≥ · · · and the numbers mi
are equal to 0 for sufficiently large i. Consider the decomposition (2.5) of Definition
2.1 of the dual module Fn×k into isotypic components
                                             X      (λk )
                                    Fn×k =       ⊕ In×k
                                                   (λk )

where the signatures (λk ) actually depend essentially on n, but since n is fixed, to
alleviate the notation we just tacitly assume this dependence. Also for k sufficiently

Proof. As remarked above, the dual (G′n , G∞ )-module In×∞ is irreducible (by The-
orem 3.1) with signature (λ), and isotypic components of different signatures are
                                               (λ)
mutually orthogonal since their projections In×kk are mutually orthogonal. Finally
if a vector in Fn×∞ , which we may assume to belong to Fn×k for some k, is or-
               (λ)                                                 (λ)
thogonal to In×∞ for all (λ), it must therefore be orthogonal to In×kk for all (λ)k ,
and hence must be the zero vector in Fn×k , and thus zero in Fn×∞ . A similar
                                                  (µ)
argument applies to the isotypic components In×∞ , and thus Eq. (3.6) holds.
                                                              (λ)
    Now fix (λ) and (µ). Then the restriction of RG∞ to In×∞ decomposes into a
(non-canonical) orthogonal direct sum of equivalent irreducible unitary representa-
tions of signature (λ)∞ . A representative of this representation
                                                              may be obtained by
applying Theorem 3.1 to get the inductive limit G∞ , R(λ)∞ of the chain (Gk , Rλk );

thogonal direct sum of equivalent irreducible unitary representations of signature

H∞ = SO (∞), and H1′ = SL   ^2 (R). Then from Eq. (2.17), (λ)k = (m, 0, . . . , 0),

Corollary 3.3. Let G∞ denote the direct product of r copies of H∞ where H∞ =

V (λ1 )∞ ⊗ · · · ⊗ V (λr )∞ , where each V (λi )∞ , 1 ≤ i ≤ r, is an irreducible unitary H∞ -

Proof. If (λi )∞ = λ1i , λ2i , . . . , λji , . . . where λji are integers such that λ1i ≥ λ2i ≥
· · · and λji = 0 for all but a finite number of j, let n denote the total number of
all nonzero entries λji , 1 ≤ i ≤ r; then V (λ1 )∞ ⊗ · · · ⊗ V (λr )∞ can be realized as a
subspace of the Bargmann–Segal–Fock space Fn×∞ . From Theorem 3.2 it follows
                                                                               (λ)

Remark. The reason that this corollary only holds for sufficiently large k can be
seen in the following example. Let Gk = U (k) × · · · × U (k) and Hk = U (k) and

Proof. To prove this corollary we apply Corollary 3.3 to G∞ = H∞ × · · · × H∞
                                                              |    {z       }
                                                                                      r

and Gk = Hk × · · · × Hk , then apply Theorem 3.2 to G∞ = H∞ × · · · × H∞ × H∞
         |    {z       }                                  |    {z       }

and Gk = Hk × · · · × Hk ⊗ HkX , and finally apply Theorem 2.1 of [KT3] to obtain
         |     {z      }
                      r
the desired result at order k. The main difficulty resides with the definition of the
                                                           ˆ V (µ )∞ , which we will construct
                                                                 X

    For each k let I k denote the identity representation of Hk on

                           ˆ V (µ )k then there exist d nonzero vectors fi,k , i = 1, . . . , d,

V (λ1 )k ⊗      ˆ V (λr )k ⊗
such that RHk (u) fi,k = fi,k for all u ∈ Hk . By construction each fi,k is a polyno-
mial function in Fn×k for some n. Thus fi,k is an Hk -invariant polynomial in Fn×k .
If Ji,k denotes the one-dimensional subspace spanned by fi,k , then for sufficiently
large k andfor each fixed   	 i = 1, . . . , d we have a chain of irreducible  unitary repre-
sentations Hk , I k , Ji,k k . We can define the isomorphism ψk+1       k
                                                                           : Ji,k → Ji,k+1 by
  k
ψk+1   (cfi,k ) = cfi,k+1 , c ∈ C; then obviously
              k                                                   k
             ψk+1 (RHk (u) fi,k ) = RHk+1 (u) fi,k+1 = RHk+1 (u) ψk+1 (fi,k ) ,
                                                               k     l
for all u ∈ Hk . Also for all k, l, m with k ≤ l ≤ m we have ψm   = ψm  ◦ ψlk . Thus
                                                        ∞
we can define the inductive limit representation {H∞ , I , Ji,∞ }, where the action
of H∞ on Ji,∞ is defined as follows:
   Let u ∈ H∞ ; then u ∈ Hk for some k. If f ∈ Ji,l for some l then
                          RH∞ (u) fl = RHk (u) ψkl f        for l < k,
and
                          RH∞ (u) fl = RHk (u) ψlk f        for k ≤ l.
                                             ∞
Then
   it follows from Theorem 3.1 that {H∞ , I , Ji,∞ } is irreducible with signature
 ~0 . The only problem with this approach is that the isomorphism embedding
      ∞
  k
ψk+1   is not the isomorphic embedding ikk+1 : Fn×k → Fn×(k+1) . To circumvent this
                                                                               	
difficulty we define the inverse or projective limit of the family Hk , I k , Jk where
                                                                           ˆ V (µ )k , as
                                                                                 X
Jk denotes the subspace of all Hk -invariants in V (λ1 )k ⊗ˆ ···⊗
                                                                ˆ V (λr )k ⊗
follows: For each pair of indices l, k with l ≤ k define a continuous homomorphism
φkl : Jk → Jl such that
      i) φkk is the identity map on Jk ,
     ii) if i ≤ l ≤ k then φki = φli ◦ φkl .
Here we can take φkl as the truncation homomorphism, i.e., φkl is defined on the
generators fi,k by
                                  φkl (fi,k ) = fi,l .
                                                	
The projective limit of the system Hk , Jk , φkl is then formally defined by

Let πk : J∞← → Jk denote the projection of J∞← onto Jk . Let I ∞← denote the
representation of H∞ on J∞← ; then πk (I ∞← f ) = πk (f ). Recall that if Pn×k
denotes the subspaceSof all polynomial functions on Cn×k the Pn×k is dense in
Fn×k . Let Pn×∞ = ∞      k=1 Pn×k denote the inductive limit of Pn×k ; then clearly
                                   ∗           ∗
Pn×∞ is dense in Fn×∞ . Let Pn×∞       (resp. Fn×∞  ) denote the dual or adjoint space
                                                                  ∗                ∗
of Pn×∞ (resp. Fn×∞ ). Then since Pn×∞ is dense in Fn×∞ , Fn×k        is dense in Pn×∞ .
By the Riesz representation theorem for Hilbert spaces, every element f ∗ ∈ Fn×∞    ∗

is of the form h · f i for some f ∈ Fn×∞ , and the map f ∗ → f is an anti-linear
                                                                ∗
(or conjugate-linear) isomorphism. Thus we can identify F∞         with F∞ and obtain
                                                              ∗
the rigged Hilbert space as the triple Pn×∞ ⊂ Fn×∞ ⊂ Pn×∞           (see [G&V] for the
definition of rigged Hilbert spaces). However, generally an element of J∞← does not
             ∗
belong to Pn×∞    , but can still be considered as a linear functional (not necessarily
continuous) on Pn×∞ , and furthermore, in this context the identity representation
I ∞← will respect the isomorphic embedding ikk+1 : Fn×k → Fn×(k+1) .

                                      4. Conclusion
    We have studied thoroughly several reciprocity theorems for some dual pairs
of groups (G′n , G∞ ) and (Hn′ , H∞ ), where G∞ is the inductive limit of a chain
{Gk } of compact groups, H∞ is the inductive limit of a chain {Hk } such that for
each k, Hk is a compact subgroup of Gk , and G′n ⊂ Hn′ are finite-dimensional Lie
groups. These theorems show, in particular, that the multiplicity of an irreducible
unitary representation of H∞ with signature (µ)H∞ in the restriction to H∞ of an
irreducible unitary representation of G∞ with signature (λ)G∞ is always finite. This
is extremely important in the problem of spectral decompositions of tensor products
of irreducible unitary representations of inductive limits of compact classical groups.
This type of problems arises naturally in Physics (cf. [K&R]), and in [H&T] tensor
product decompositions of tame representations of U (∞) are investigated. In [Ol2]
Ol’shanskii generalized Howe’s theory of dual pairs to some infinite-dimensional
dual pairs of groups. This is the right context to generalize the reciprocity theorem
3.2 for the infinite-dimensional dual pairs (G′∞ , G∞ ) and (H∞  ′
                                                                   , H∞ ) which will be
part of our work in a forthcoming publication.
