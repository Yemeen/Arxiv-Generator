 Abstract. For the modular lattice D4 = {1 + 1 + 1 + 1} associated with the extended
 Dynkin diagram D    e 4 (and also for Dr , where r > 4), Gelfand and Ponomarev introduced
 the notion of admissible and perfect lattice elements and classified them. In this work, we
 classify the admissible and perfect elements in the modular lattice D2,2,2 = {2 + 2 + 2}
 associated with the extended Dynkin diagram E         e6 . Gelfand and Ponomarev constructed
 admissible elements for Dr recurrently in the length of multi-indices, which they called
 admissible sequences. Here we suggest a direct method for creating admissible elements.
 Admissible sequences and admissible elements for D2,2,2 (resp. D4 ) form 14 classes (resp.
 11 classes) and possess some periodicity.
      If under all indecomposable representations of a modular lattice the image of an element
 is either zero or the whole representation space, the element is said to be perfect. Our
 classification of perfect elements for D2,2,2 is based on the description of admissible elements.
 The constructed set H + of perfect elements is the union of 64-element distributive lattices
 H + (n), and H + is the distributive lattice itself. The lattice of perfect elements B + obtained
 by Gelfand and Ponomarev for D4 can be imbedded into the lattice of perfect elements H + ,
 associated with D2,2,2 .

                                                have not mentioned, are a belated validation of
                                                Garrett Birkhoffs vision, which we learned in three
                                                editions of his Lattice Theory, and they betoken
                                                Professor Gelfand’s oft-repeated prediction that
                                                lattice theory will play a leading role in the
                                                mathematics of the twenty-first century.

                                                                         G-C Rota, [R97, p.1445].

                  1.1. Modular and linear lattices, perfect elements
    The objects considered in this work have diverse applications from quantum logic of
quantum mechanics (see Remark 1.1.2) to representation problems of posets and quivers of
tame type (see §1.3). The potential of these applications is, however, still dormant to a
considerable extent, even the basic notions are not widely known. In Appendix A we give
definitions and examples of some notions including modular and linear lattices, representa-
tions of modular lattices and perfect elements. In this section we briefly remind a number
of notions.
    A lattice is a set L with two commutative and associative operations: a sum and an
intersection. If a, b ∈ L, then we denote the intersection by ab and the sum by a + b. Both
operations are idempotent
                                     aa = a, a + a = a
and satisfy the absorbtion law
                                   a(a + b) = a,     a + ab = a.
On the lattice L, an inclusion ⊆ is defined:
                                a ⊆ b ⇐⇒ ab = a or a + b = b,
see §A.1.
    A lattice is said to be modular if, for every b, a, c ∈ L,
                                  a ⊆ b =⇒ b(a + c) = a + bc,                                (1.1)
see §A.2.
    Good examples of modular lattices, bringing us some intuition, are the lattices of sub-
spaces of a given vector space, normal subgroups of a given group, ideals of a given ring.
    Remark 1.1.1. Actually, the above examples of modular lattices are more than modular.
In his famous work [Hai85] M. Haiman baptized these lattice the linear lattices. The linear
lattices are also known as lattices of commuting equivalence relations, see §A.9. The term
linear was suggested by G.-C.Rota, see [Hai85, p.1], [FMR96].
    The linear lattices were studied by B. Jónsson in [Jo53], [Jo54], where these lattices
were named lattices with representations of type 1. In [Jo53] B. Jónsson also introduced

the Arguesian law also studied by M. P. Schützenberger [Sch45]. The Arguesian law, see
[MY2000, p.3] and [Hai85], is a lattice-theoretic form of the Desargues theorem of projec-
tive geometry, see [Gr98, Ch.4]. Lattices satisfying the Arguesian law are called Arguesian
lattices. For more details about linear and Arguesian lattices, see §A.9. On Fig. 1.1 the
hierarchical relations between three classes of lattices: modular, Arguesian, and linear are
shown.




                   Figure 1.1.       Modular, Arguesian and Linear Lattices

     We denote by D r the free modular lattice with r generators
                                         D r = {e1 , . . . , er },                               (1.2)
see [GP74], [Fr80]. The word “free” means that no relation exists between generators
ei , i = 1, . . . , r.
      Denote by D 2,2,2 the modular lattice with 6 generators {x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , x3 , y3 } satisfying
the following relations:
                            D 2,2,2 = {x1 ⊆ y1 ,     x2 ⊆ y2 ,       x3 ⊆ y3 }.                  (1.3)
Symbol D in (1.2) and (1.3) is used in honour of R. Dedekind who derived the main properties
of the modular lattices, [De1897]. The modular law (1.1) is also known as Dedekind’s law
and the modular lattices are sometimes called the Dedekind lattices, see §A.2.
    Let L be a modular lattice, X a finite dimensional vector space, L(X) the modular lattice
of linear subspaces in L. A morphism ρ : L −→ L(X) is called a linear representation of L
in the space X, see §A.6. By §A.9 (Proposition A.9.5) the modular lattice L(X) is a linear
lattice. Thus, we consider representations of the modular lattice L in the linear lattices
L(X).
    Following [GP74] we introduce now the notions of perfect elements and linear equiva-
lence relation. The element a ∈ L is said to be perfect if ρ(a) = 0 or ρ(a) = X for each

indecomposable representation ρ of the modular lattice L, where X is the representation
space of ρ, see §A.6.
   Two elements a, b ∈ L are called linearly equivalent if ρ(a) = ρ(b) for all indecomposable
representations ρ : L −→ L(X) and we write
                                          a ≡ b mod θ.                                   (1.4)
The relation θ is called the linear equivalence relation, see §A.6.
    Remark 1.1.2. Manin [Man79, p.98] pointed out at a connection between perfect ele-
ments and quantum tautologies in the quantum logic introduced by Birkhoff and von Neu-
mann in [BvN36]. In quantum logic, a perfect element is called a modular question [Man79].
In [KS67], Kochen and Specker considered related topics in the foundations of the quantum
mechanics and the quantum logic.
    G.-C.Rota writes in [R97, p.1444] that Haiman’s proof theory [Hai85] for linear lattices
brings to fruition the program that was set forth in [BvN36]: “The authors1 did not know
that the modular lattices of quantum mechanics are linear lattices. In light of Haiman’s proof
theory, we may now confidently assert that Birkhoff and von Neumann’s logic of quantum
mechanics is indeed the long-awaited new “logic”. . . ”.
    Finberg, Mainetti and Rota in [FMR96] gave a simplified presentation of the work of
Haiman [Hai85].
    For more details about linear lattices, see §A.9.
                            1.2. Outline of admissible elements
     First, in this section, we outline the idea of admissible elements due to Gelfand and
Ponomarev [GP74]. In [GP74], [GP76], these elements were used to obtain the distribu-
tive sublattice of perfect polynomials . We think today, that apart from being helpful in
construction of perfect elements, the admissible elements are interesting in themselves.
     Further, we outline properties of admissible elements obtained in this work: finite clas-
sification, ϕ−homomorphism, reduction to atomic elements and periodicity, see 1.2.2.
    1.2.1. The idea of admissible elements of Gelfand and Ponomarev. Here, we
describe, omitting some details, the idea of constructing the elementary maps and admissible
elements of Gelfand-Ponomarev. As we will see below, the admissible elements grow, in a
sense, from generators of the lattice or from the lattice’s unity.
    For every representation ρ of the modular lattice L, a new representation ρ̃ is uniquely
constructed by means of the Coxeter functor Φ+ , introduced by Bernstein, Gelfand and
Ponomarev in [BGP73] to study representations of graphs, see §A.8. Let X (resp. X̃) be
a space of the representation ρ (resp. ρ̃), and L(X) (resp. L(X̃)) be the set of subspaces of
X (resp. X̃):
                             ρ : L −→ L(X), ρ̃ : L −→ L(X̃).                            (1.5)
    Construction of the elementary map ϕ. Let there exist a map ϕ mapping every subspace
A ∈ L(X̃) to some subspace B ∈ L(X):
                                       ϕ : L(X̃) −→ L(X),
                                                          ϕ
                                                                                         (1.6)
                                   ϕA = B,        or   A 7−→ B.
It turns out that for many elements a ∈ L there exists an element b ∈ L (at least in L = D 4
and D 2,2,2 ) such that
                                       ϕρ̃(a) = ρ(b)                                   (1.7)

for every pair of representations (ρ, ρ̃), where ρ̃ = Φ+ ρ. The map ϕ in (1.7) is constructed
in such a way, that ϕ do not depend on ρ. Thus, we can write
                                                    ϕ
                                              a 7−→ b.                                      (1.8)
In particular, eq. (1.7) and (1.8) are true for admissible elements, whose definition will be
given later, see §1.7. Eq. (1.7) is the main property characterizing the admissible elements.
    For D 4 , Gelfand and Ponomarev constructed 4 maps of form (1.6): ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 , ϕ4 and
called them elementary maps. In this work, for D 2,2,2, we construct 3 maps ϕi , one per chain
xi ⊆ yi , see (§1.6 and Ch.2). Given a sequence of relations

We say that elements a2 , a3 , . . . , ain−2 , ain−1 , ain grow from the element ai1 . By abuse of
language, we say that elements growing from generators ei or unity I are admissible elements,
and the corresponding sequence of indices {in in−1 in−2 . . . i2 i1 } is said to be the admissible
sequence. For details in the cases D 2,2,2 (resp. D 4 ) see §1.7.1, (resp. §1.7.2).

    1.2.2. Reduction of the admissible elements to atomic elements. Here, we
briefly give steps of creation of the admissible elements in this work.
    1.2.2.1. Finite classification. The admissible elements (and admissible sequences) can be
reduced to a finite number of classes, see §1.7. Admissible sequences for D 2,2,2 (resp. D 4 )
are depicted on Fig. 1.3 (resp. Fig. 1.4). The key property of admissible sequences allowing
to do this classification is the following relation between maps ϕi .
    For D 2,2,2 (see Proposition 2.10.2):
                              iji = iki,
                          ϕi ϕj ϕi = ϕi ϕk ϕi , where {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}.
     For D 4 (see Proposition 4.6.1):
                            ikj = ilj,
                       ϕi ϕk ϕj = ϕi ϕl ϕj , where {i, j, k, l} = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
    1.2.2.2. ϕi −homomorphism. In a sense, the elementary maps ϕi are homomorphic with
respect to admissible elements. More exactly, introduce a notion of ϕi −homomorphic ele-
ments. Let
                                    ϕi              ϕi
                                a 7−→ ã and p 7−→ p̃.                           (1.10)
The element a ∈ L is said to be ϕi −homomorphic, if
                                                    ϕi
                                             ap 7−→ ãp̃                                   (1.11)
for all p ∈ L, see §1.6.
    1.2.2.3. Reduction to atomic elements. We permanently apply the following mechanism
of creation of admissible elements from more simple elements. Let ϕi be any elementary

    1.2.2.4. Periodicity. Admissible sequences obtained by reducing in heading (1) possess
some periodicity. The corresponding admissible elements are also periodic. On Fig. 1.2 we
see an example of admissible elements for D 2,2,2 :

                               e(213)p (21) ,   e3(213)p (21) ,   e13(213)p (21) .

Three vertical lines on Fig. 1.2 correspond to three series of inclusions:
              · · · ⊆ e(213)p+1 (21) ⊆ e(213)p (21) ⊆ · · · ⊆ e(213)(21) ⊆ e(21) ,
              · · · ⊆ e3(213)p+1 (21) ⊆ e3(213)p (21) ⊆ · · · ⊆ e3(213)(21) ⊆ e3(21) ,            (1.13)
              · · · ⊆ e13(213)p+1 (21) ⊆ e13(213)p (21) ⊆ · · · ⊆ e13(213)(21) ⊆ e13(21) ⊆ e1 ,

Relation (1.13) is easily obtained from Table C.2. From the same table we can see periodicity
of indices of atomic elements entering in the decomposition of admissible elements. The
triangular helix on Fig. 1.2 corresponds to relations
                                                    ϕ3
                                     e(213)p (21) 7−→ e3(213)p (21) ,
                                                     ϕ1
                                     e3(213)p (21) 7−→ e13(213)p (21) ,                           (1.14)
                                                      ϕ2

Relation (1.14) is a particular case of the main theorem on admissible elements (Theorem
2.12.1).

               1.3. Bibliographic notes: word problems, tame problems
    Admissible elements for D r in [GP74], [GP76] are built recurrently in the length of
multi-indices named admissible sequences. In this work we suggest a direct method for
creating admissible elements. For D 2,2,2 (resp. D 4 ), the admissible sequences and admissible
elements form 14 classes (resp. 11 classes) and possess some periodicity properties, see §1.7.1,
Tables 2.2, 2.3 (resp. §1.7.2, Tables 4.1, 4.3).
    For the definition of admissible polynomials due to Gelfand and Ponomarev and exam-
ples obtained from this definition, see §4.8.2. Dlab and Ringel in [DR80] and Cylke in
[Cyl82] proved that perfect elements1 constructed by Gelfand and Ponomarev coincide with
all possible perfect elements modulo linear equivalence, see §A.6.
    The study of D r , where r ≥ 4 might be a rather hard task. We just point to two works
on the word problem for the free modular lattices. Herrmann proved in [H83] that the
word problem in D 4 is unsolvable, and Freese in [Fr80] proved that the word problem in
D r is unsolvable for r ≥ 5. Furthermore, Herrmann proved that the modular lattice freely
generated by a partially ordered set P containing one of lattices
                              1 + 1 + 1 + 1,      2 + 2 + 2,     1 + 2 + 3,
has an unsolvable word problem, [H83, p.526]. Thus, the modular lattice D 2,2,2 , which is
of interest to us, has also an unsolvable word problem. We mention also the following fact
proved by Wille [W73]: a modular lattice is finite if and only if it does not contain
                                  1+1+1+1            and     1 + 2 + 2.
   Gelfand conjectured that the free linear lattice in four generators has the solvable word
problem. If this conjecture is true, it would distinguish the class of linear lattices from that
of modular lattices, see [KY2003, p.4].
   The problem of classifying all indecomposable representations of D 4 (indecomposable
quadruples) of subspaces of arbitrary finite dimensional spaces is equivalent to that of deter-
mining all indecomposable representations of the graph

which corresponds to the extended Dynkin diagram Ẽ6 . This is also a representation problem
of tame type solved by Nazarova [Naz73] and by Dlab and Ringel [DR74], [DR76].
    Ponomarev considered in detail perfect elements for lattices related to the Dynkin dia-
gram An [Pon90]. For every Dynkin diagram, he described perfect elements by means of
so-called hereditary subsets in the corresponding Auslander-Reiten diagram, [Pon90, Theo-
rem 1.6].
    Cylke [Cyl93] has constructed a sublattice B + (S) ∪ B − (S) in the modular lattice L(S)
freely generated by a poset S of finite type, or tame type of finite growth. The sublattice
B + (S)∪B − (S) is a natural generalization of the sublattices B + ∪B − of perfect elements con-
structed by Gelfand-Ponomarev [GP74]. The sublattice B + (S) ∪ B − (S) is built by means of
poset differentiation. Nazarova and Roiter used this technique to construct indecomposable
representations of posets and quivers [NR72], [Naz73], [Ro85], [GR92].

                                1.4. Outline of this work
    In this work we construct admissible and perfect elements for the modular lattice D 2,2,2 ,
associated with the extended Dynkin diagram E   e6 , see Ch.2 – Ch.3, and admissible elements
                          4
for the modular lattice D , associated with the extended Dynkin diagram D    e 4 , see Ch.4. For
  4
D , the admissible elements constructed in this work and admissible elements constructed
by Gelfand and Ponomarev [GP74] coincide at least modulo linear equivalence, see §4.8.2.
    The diagrams E  e6 and De 4 are tame quivers, i.e., their representations can be classified
[Naz73], [DR76].
    During the construction of perfect elements in the lattice D 2,2,2 various lattice poly-
nomials in D 2,2,2 naturally appear: atomic, ϕ−homomorphic, admissible, cumulative and
perfect. Atomic polynomials form a basis for constructing admissible elements. The cumula-
tive polynomials are constructed by means of admissible elements, and perfect elements are
constructed from the cumulative elements:
            Atomic =⇒ Admissible             =⇒ Cumulative =⇒ Perfect

    In the sequel to this paper we intend to show that admissible sequences play an important
role in the study of the preprojective algebras, [GP79], [DR79], [Rin96].
    The results of the work were partially published in [St89].

    In Ch.2 we introduce atomic, admissible and cumulative lattice polynomials and consider
basic properties of these polynomials. Table 2.3 gives a full list of admissible polynomials
for D 2,2,2, see also §1.7.
    In Ch.3 we obtain sublattices of perfect elements H + (n) in D 2,2,2 and show that the
lattice

                                              n=0
is a distributive lattice of perfect elements. The union H + has an interesting architecture
and contains distributive lattice B + of perfect elements of D 4 , see Fig. 1.6, §1.12.
    In Ch.4, by repeating the technique developed for D 2,2,2 in Ch.2, we construct admissible
elements in D 4 .
    For the convenience of the reader, we recall in Appendix A some properties of the modular
lattices, their representations, and give a brief introduction to linear lattices.
    Proofs of a number of theorems and verification of several properties are moved to Ap-
pendices B and C.

    In this work we consider the diagram E    e6 only with central orientation in which all arrows
are directed to the vertex x0 . The modular lattice D 2,2,2 is generated by partially ordered set
2 + 2 + 2. The generators xi , yi , (i = 1, 2, 3) satisfy the inclusions xi ⊆ yi . For convenience,
we include unity I in the lattice D 2,2,2 :

     x1 → y1       → x0 ← y2 ← x2                       x1 ⊆       y1      ⊆   I ⊇ y2 ⊇ x2

Following Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev [BGP73] and Gelfand-Ponomarev [GP74] we use
the Coxeter functor Φ+ , and the elementary linear maps ϕi .

                                      1.5. Atomic polynomials
    Atomic lattice polynomials have a simple lattice definition. They are called atomic
because admissible, cumulative and perfect lattice polynomials (as well as invariant in [St92])
are defined by means of these polynomials.
    For D 2,2,2 , the definition of aij    ij
                                     n , An , n ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . }, is cyclic through the indices i, j, k,
where the triple {i, j, k} is a permutation of {1, 2, 3}. We set

                1.6. The elementary maps ϕi of Gelfand-Ponomarev
    Throughout the work the maps ϕi play a central role. For exact definition of the maps ϕi ,
see §2.3. Gelfand and Ponomarev introduced the maps ϕi in [GP74, p.27] for the modular
lattices D r and called them elementary maps.
    Remark 1.6.1 (An explanation of indices). Let X0 be the representation space of the
representation ρ, X0n be the representation space of the representation ρn = (Φ+ )n ρ, where
n ≥ 1 and Φ+ is the Coxeter transformation. The lower index 0 means that X0n is the image
of the generator x0 of the lattice D 2,2,2 under the representation (Φ+ )n ρ, see (1.15):
                (Φ+ )n ρ(x0 ) = X0n for n ≥ 1, where ρ(x0 ) = X0 .
                (Φ+ )n ρ(yi ) = Yin for n ≥ 1, where ρ(yi ) = Yi , (i = 1, 2, 3).      (1.18)
                (Φ+ )n ρ(xi ) = Xin for n ≥ 1, where ρ(xi ) = Xi , (i = 1, 2, 3).
The indices i = 1, 2, 3 of ϕi mean that ϕi operates to the subspace Yi ⊆ X0 , where Yi is the
image of the generator yi under the representation Φ+ ρ, see (1.19):


  X1 ⊆ Y 1 ⊆ X0 ⊇ Y 2 ⊇ X2                     X11 ⊆     Y11⊆ X01 ⊇ Y21 ⊇ X21

                     ϕi Φ+ ρ(ap) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(a)ϕi Φ+ ρ(p) for all p ⊆ D 2,2,2 .          (1.20)
   An element a ⊆ D 2,2,2 is said to be (ϕi , yk )−homomorphic, if
                     ϕi Φ+ ρ(ap) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(yk a)ϕi Φ+ ρ(p) for all p ⊆ yk .            (1.21)
  Here Φ+ ρ(a), Φ+ ρ(p) are the images of a, p ∈ D 2,2,2 under representation Φ+ ρ (see
Remark 1.6.1). For the detailed definition of ϕi and related notions, see §2.2–§2.3.
  The notion of ϕi −homomorphic elements in D 4 is similarly introduced in §4.7.
   All atomic polynomials are ϕi −homomorphic. More exactly, for D 2,2,2 , we have (see
Theorem 2.8.1, §2.8):
   1) The polynomials aij
                       n are ϕi − and ϕj −homomorphic.
   2) The polynomials Aij
                        n are ϕi −homomorphic.
                        ij
   3) The polynomials An are (ϕj , yk )−homomorphic.
   For D 4 , we have (Theorem 4.7.1, §4.7):
   1) The polynomials aijn are ϕi −homomorphic.
   2) The polynomials aijn (ϕj , ek )−homomorphic.

   1.7.1. Admissible sequences for D 2,2,2. The admissible lattice polynomials are intro-
duced in §2.12. They appear when we use different maps ϕi , where i = 1, 2, 3. The admissible
polynomials can be indexed by means of a finite number of types of index sequences, called

admissible sequences. Consider a finite sequence of indices s = in . . . i1 , where ip ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
The sequence s is said to be admissible if

         (a) Adjacent indices are distinct (ip 6= ip+1 ) .
         (b) In each subsequence iji, we can replace index j by k. In other words:
         . . . iji · · · = . . . iki . . . , where all indices i, j, k are distinct .

   The admissible sequence with i1 = 1 for D 2,2,2 may be transformed to one of the seven
types (Proposition 2.11.1, see §2.11),


                   1) (213)m (21)n ,       2) 3(213)m (21)n ,    3) 13(213)m(21)n ,
                   4) (312)m (31)n ,       5) 2(312)m (31)n ,    6) 12(312)m(31)n ,         (1.22)
                            n          n
                   7) 1(21) = 1(31) .

similarly for i1 = 2, 3, for example, for i1 = 2, the admissible sequences are:

                   1) (123)m (12)n ,       2) 3(123)m (12)n ,    3) 23(123)m(12)n ,
                   4) (321)m (32)n ,       5) 1(321)m (32)n ,    6) 21(321)m(32)n ,         (1.23)
                            n          n
                   7) 2(12) = 2(32) .

    A description of all admissible sequences for D 2,2,2 is given in Table 2.2, and a description
of all admissible elements is given in Table 2.3. For every

                                           zα = eα , fα , gα0

from Table 2.3, where α is an admissible sequence, the following statement takes place:
   Let α be an admissible sequence in . . . i1 and i 6= in . Then iα is also an admissible
sequence and

                        ϕi Φ+ ρ(zα ) = ρ(ziα ) for each representation ρ

(Theorem 2.12.1, §2.12; see Fig. 1.3).



    1.7.2. Admissible sequences for D 4 . The admissible sequence for D 4 is defined as
follows. Consider a finite sequence of indices s = in . . . i1 , where ip ∈ {1, 2, 3}. The sequence
s is said to be admissible if

         (a) Adjacent indices are distinct (ip 6= ip+1 ).
          (b) In each subsequence ijl, we can replace index j by k. In other words:
         . . . ijl · · · = . . . ikl . . . , where all indices i, j, k, l are distinct.

   Any admissible sequence with i = 1 for D 4 may be transformed to one the next 11 types

     Let α be an admissible sequence in . . . i1 and i 6= in , where is ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. Let zα =
eα , fα0 be admissible elements for D 4 from Table 4.3. Then iα is also an admissible sequence
and

directly constructed, see Table 4.3.

   Admissible polynomials given by Table 4.3 coincide mod θ1 with polynomials constructed
by Gelfand and Ponomarev. For small lengths of the admissible sequences, we prove that
these polynomials coincide without restriction mod θ, see Propositions 4.8.3, 4.8.4, 4.8.5
from §4.8.2.

    Remark 1.7.1. In §A.10 we mention a connection between some Howe-Huang projective
invariants of quadruples [HH96], the Grassmann-Cayley algebra [BBR85] and admissible
elements in D 4 .

                1.8. Inclusion of admissible elements in the modular lattice
     One can easily check, with definitions from Table 2.3, that
                                           fα ⊆ eα ,    gα0 ⊆ eα .                       (1.26)
It is more difficult to prove the following theorem (see Theorem 2.13.1, §2.13, Appendix C):
   Theorem. For every admissible sequence α and αi, where i = 1, 2, 3 from Table 2.2, we
have
                              eαi ⊆ gα0 , i = 1, 2, 3.

    A proof of the theorem is given in Appendix C. This proof uses case by case consideration
of admissible sequences α from Table 2.3.

                            1.9. Examples of the admissible elements
    1.9.1. The lattice D 2,2,2 . Let n be the length of an admissible sequence α, let k and p
be indices defined by Table 2.3.

   For n = 1:         α = 1, (Table 2.3, Line 7, k = 0). We have
                             e1 = y1 ,     f1 = x1 ⊆ e1 ,       g10 = y1 (y2 + y3 ).
   For n = 2:         α = 21, (Table 2.3, Line 9, k = 0, p = 0). Here,
      e21 = y2 a13
                1 = y2 (x1 + y3 ),        e12 = y1 (x2 + y3 ) ⊆ g10 ,      (permutation (21) → (12)).
      f21 = y2 y3 ⊆ e21 ,      g210 = e21 (x2 + A13
                                                 1 ) = y2 (x1 + y3 )(x2 + x3 + y1 ).

   For n = 3:         α = 321, (Table 2.3, Line 10, k = 0, p = 0). In this case:
                 e321 = y3 A12 23
                            1 A1 = y3 (y1 + x2 )(y2 + x3 ),
                 e213 = y2 (y3 + x1 )(x1 + x2 ) ⊆ g210 , (permutation (321) → (213)),
                 f321 = x3 A12
                            1 = x3 (y1 + x2 ) ⊆ e321 ,

                 g3210 = e321 (y1 y3 + a12
                                        1 ) = y3 (y1 + x2 )(y2 + x3 )(x1 + y2 + y1 y3 ).

   For n = 4:         α = 1321, (Table 2.3, Line 11, k = 0, p = 0 ). Here, we have
              e1321 = y1 a13 32
                          1 a2 = y1 (x1 + y3 )(x3 + y2 (x2 + y1 )),
              e3213 = y3 (x3 + y2 )(x2 + y1 (x1 + y3 )), (permutation (1321) → (3213)).
By the modular law (A.3) of D 2,2,2 and since x1 ⊆ y1 , we have
                               y1 (x1 + y3 ) = x1 + y1 y3     and
                               e3213 = y3 (x3 + y2 )(x2 + x1 + y1 y3 ) ⊆ g3210 .
Further,
                                  f1321 = y1 y2 a13
                                                 1 = y1 y2 (x1 + y3 ) ⊆ e1321
and
                   g13210 = e1321 (x1 + a32 32
                                         1 A1 ) = e1321 (x1 + (x3 + y2 )(y3 + x2 )) =
                   y1 (x1 + y3 )(x3 + y2 (x2 + y1 ))(x1 + (x3 + y2 )(y3 + x2 )).


   1.9.2. The lattice D 4 . Admissible sequences and admissible elements are taken from
Table 4.3.
   For n = 1:   α = 1, (Table 4.3, Line G11, r = 0, s = 0, t = 0). We have
                   e1 = e1     (admissible element e1 coincides with generator e1 ),
                   f10 = e1 (e2 + e3 + e4 ) ⊆ e1 .
   For n = 2:         α = 21, (Table 4.3, Line G21, r = 0, s = 0, t = 1). We have
                             e21 =e2 (e3 + e4 ),
                            f210 =e2 (e3 + e4 )(e4 + e3 (e1 + e2 ) + e1 ) =

   For n = 3:         Consider two admissible sequences: α = 121 and α = 321 = 341.
26                                         1. INTRODUCTION

     1) α = 121, (Table 4.3, Line G11, r = 0, s = 0, t = 1). We have
               e121 =e1 a34
                         2 = e1 (e3 + e4 (e1 + e2 )) =
                       e1 (e3 (e1 + e2 ) + e4 (e1 + e2 )),
              f1210 =e121 (e1 a32   24 34

                       e1 (e3 + e4 (e1 + e2 ))(e1 (e2 + e3 ) + (e2 + e4 )(e3 + e4 )) ⊆ e121 .
     2) α = 321 = 341, (Table 4.3, Line G31, t = 0, s = 0, r = 1). We have
            e321 = e341 =e3 a21 14
                             1 a1 = e3 (e2 + e1 )(e4 + e1 ),

          f3210 = f3410 =e321 (a14      24
                                2 + e3 a1 ) =
                           e321 (e1 + e4 (e3 + e2 ) + e3 (e2 + e4 )) =
                           e321 (e1 + (e3 + e2 )(e4 + e2 )(e3 + e4 )) =
                           e3 (e2 + e1 )(e4 + e1 )(e1 + (e3 + e2 )(e4 + e2 )(e3 + e4 )) ⊆ e321 .
   For n = 4:        α = 2341 = 2321 = 2141, (Table 4.3, Line F 21, s = 0, t = 1, r = 1). We
have
                  e2141 =e2 a41 34
                             2 a1 = e2 (e4 + e1 (e3 + e2 ))(e3 + e4 ),

                                  2 + e1 a2 ) =
                          e2141 (e2 (e4 + e1 (e3 + e2 )) + e1 (e2 + e4 (e1 + e3 ))) ⊆ e21 .

                                 1.10. Cumulative polynomials
    The cumulative polynomials xt (n), yt (n), where t = 1, 2, 3, and x0 (n) (all of length n) are
sums of all admissible elements of the same length n, where n is the length of the multi-index.
In other words, cumulative polynomials are as follows
                                        X
                              xt (n) =     fin ...i2 t , t = 1, 2, 3,
                                        X
                              yt (n) =     ein ...i2 t , t = 1, 2, 3,
                                        X
                              x0 (n) =      gin ...i2 0 .

From (1.26) and Theorem 2.13.1 we deduce that:
                                 xt (n) ⊆ yt (n) ⊆ x0 (n),        t = 1, 2, 3.
The cumulative polynomials satisfy the same inclusions as the corresponding generators in
D 2,2,2 .

                      1.11. Examples of the cumulative polynomials
     For n = 1:
                                             x1 (1) = f1 = x1 ,
                                             y1 (1) = e1 = y1 ,
                                             x0 (1) = g0 = I.
i.e., the cumulative polynomials for n = 1 coincide with the generators of D 2,2,2 .

   For n = 2:       By the modular law (A.3) and since y3 (x1 + y2 ) ⊆ x1 + y3 , we have
               x1 (2) =f21 + f31 = y2 y3 ,             (f21 = f31 = y2 y3 ),
                y1 (2) =e21 + e31 = y2 (x1 + y3 ) + y3 (x1 + y2 ) =
                        (x1 + y3 )(y2 + y3 (x1 + y2 )) = (x1 + y3 )(y2 + y3 )(x1 + y2 ),
               x0 (2) =g10 + g20 + g30 = y1 (y2 + y3 ) + y2 (y1 + y3 ) + y3 (y2 + y3 ) =
                        (y2 + y3 )(y1 + y3 )(y1 + y2 ).
   For n = 3:       (see Fig. 1.3)
                                        x1 (3) = f321 + f121 + f231 ,
                                        y1 (3) = e321 + e121 + e231 .
From Table 2.3 (Line 8, k = 0) f121 = y1 (x2 + x3 ) and by §1.9.1 it follows that
       x1 (3) = x3 (y1 + x2 ) + y1 (x2 + x3 ) + x2 (y1 + x3 ) = (x2 + x3 )(y1 + x2 )(y1 + x3 ).
Again, from Table 2.3 (Line 8, k = 0) e121 = y1 (x2 + y3 )(y2 + x3 ) and by §1.9.1, we have
           y1 (3) = y3 (y1 + x2 )(y2 + x3 ) + y1 (x2 + y3 )(y2 + x3 ) + y2 (y1 + x3 )(y3 + x2 ).
Finally,
                           x0 (3) =g210 + g310 + g320 + g120 + g230 + g130 =
                                   X
                                        yi (xj + yk )(yj + xi + xk ),
where the sum runs over all permutations {i, j, k} of {1, 2, 3}.

                    1.12. The sublattice H + (n) of the perfect elements
   The perfect elements (see §A.6) are constructed in the following way:

 For n = 0:
      ai (0) = yj + yk ,
      bi (0) = xi + yj + yk ,
                                   X
      c1 (0) = c2 (0) = c3 (0) =         yi .
                                                                                                   (1.27)
 For n ≥ 1:
      ai (n) = xj (n) + xk (n) + yj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1),
      bi (n) = ai (n) + xi (n + 1) = xj (n) + xk (n) + xi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1),
      ci (n) = ai (n) + yi (n + 1) = xj (n) + xk (n) + yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1).
 Proposition (see Proposition 2.13.3, §2.12). If zt (n) is one of the cumulative polynomials
xt (n), yt (n), where t = 1, 2, 3, or x0 , then
                                  X
                                       ϕi Φ+ ρ(zt (n)) = ρ(zt (n + 1)).
                                i = 1, 2, 3

   We will also show (Proposition 2.10.1) that the property of element z to be perfect follows
from the same property of element u if
                                   X
                                        ϕ1 Φ+ ρ(z) = ρ(u).
                                         i = 1, 2, 3

       Two generator systems: {ai ⊆ bi ⊆ ci }, §1.12 and {pi ⊆ qi ⊆ si }, §3.5.

The elements zt (n) are not perfect, but perfect elements are expressed as sums of cumulative
polynomials.
Proposition (see Proposition 3.1.1, §3.1). The elements ai (n), bi (n), ci (n) are perfect for
all n.
    The elements ai (n) ⊆ bi (n) ⊆ ci (n), where i = 1, 2, 3, generate the 64-element distributive
sublattice H + (n) of perfect elements for n ≥ 1 (see Fig. 1.5) and the 27-element distributive
sublattice H + (n) of perfect elements for n = 0. The sublattice H + (0) contains only 27
elements because c1 (0) = c2 (0) = c3 (0).

   1.13.1. Perfect cubes in the free modular lattice D r . In [GP74], Gelfand and
Ponomarev constructed the sublattice B of perfect elements for the free modular lattice D r
with r generators:
                     [                      [∞                   ∞
                                                                 [
                   +      +            +          +         −
              B=B       B , where B =           B (n), B =           B − (n).
                                                   n=1                    n=1

They proved that every sublattice B + (n) (resp. B − (n)) is 2r -element Boolean algebra, so-
called Boolean cube (which can be also named perfect Boolean cube) and these cubes are
ordered in the following way. Every element of the cube B + (n) is included in every element
of the cube B + (n + 1), i.e.,
                                                
                      v + (n) ∈ B + (n)
                                                  =⇒ v + (n + 1) ⊆ v + (n).
                      v + (n + 1) ∈ B + (n + 1)
By analogy, the dual relation holds:
                                                   
                       v − (n) ∈ B − (n)
                                                       =⇒ v − (n) ⊆ v − (n + 1).
                       v − (n + 1) ∈ B − (n + 1)

        Elementary maps ϕi and atomic, admissible, cumulative
                            polynomials

2.1. Construction of the Coxeter functor Φ+ by means of the lattice operations
    Following Gelfand and Ponomarev [GP74, GP76] we construct the representation Φ+ ρ
by means of the lattice operations. Our construction is different from the classic definition
of the Coxeter functor of Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev [BGP73].
    The representation Φ+ ρ is constructed in the space
                                                             X
                          X01 = {(η1 , η2 , η3 ) | ηi ∈ Yi ,   ηi = 0},
where i runs over the set {1, 2, 3}. Set
                                                        M
                                                 R=                 Yi ,
                                                      i = 1, 2, 3

i.e.,
                           R = {(η1 , η2 , η3 ) | ηi ∈ Yi , i = 1, 2, 3}.
Then we see that    X01
                     ⊆ R. Hereafter ηi denotes a vector from the space Yi and ξi denotes a
vector from the space Xi .
                                   ′    ′
   Introduce the spaces Gi , Hi , Gi , Hi ⊆ R, where i = 1, 2, 3:

               G1   = {(η1 , 0, 0) | η1 ∈ Y1 },                       H1       = {(ξ1 , 0, 0) | ξ1 ∈ X1 },
               G2   = {(0, η2 , 0) | η2 ∈ Y2 },                       H2       = {(0, ξ2 , 0) | ξ2 ∈ X2 },
               G3   = {(0, 0, η3) | η3 ∈ Y3 },                        H3       = {(0, 0, ξ3) | ξ3 ∈ X3 },
                ′                                                      ′                                       (2.1)
               G1   = {(ξ1 , η2 , η3 ) | ξ1 ∈ X1 , ηi ∈ Yi },         H1       = {(0, η2 , η3 ) | ηi ∈ Yi },
                ′                                                      ′
               G2   = {(η1 , ξ2 , η3 ) | ξ2 ∈ X2 , ηi ∈ Yi },         H2       = {(η1 , 0, η3 ) | ηi ∈ Yi },
                ′                                                      ′
               G3   = {(η1 , η2 , ξ3) | ξ3 ∈ X3 , ηi ∈ Yi },          H3       = {(η1 , η3 , 0) | ηi ∈ Yi }.
    Now, let
                                                             ′
                                                 Yi1 = Gi X01 ,                                                (2.2)

                                                             ′
                                                 Xi1 = Hi X01 ,                                                (2.3)

                         ρ1 = Φ+ ρ = [Xi1 ⊆ Yi1 ⊆ X01 | i = 1, 2, 3].                                          (2.4)
This construction of the Coxeter functor Φ+ is well-defined as follows from §A.8.

                          2.2. The associated representations ν 0 , ν 1
    With representations ρ and ρ1 we associate the following representations ν 0 , ν 1 in R:

                     ν 0 (yi ) = X01 + Gi ,       ν 0 (xi ) = X01 + Hi ,               i = 1, 2, 3,            (2.5)

                                            ′                              ′
                          ν 1 (yi ) = X01 Gi ,    ν 1 (xi ) = X01 Hi ,              i = 1, 2, 3.               (2.6)

32         2. ELEMENTARY MAPS ϕi , ATOMIC, ADMISSIBLE,CUMULATIVE POLYNOMIALS

Let µ : X01 −→ R be an inclusion. Then
                             ν 1 (a) = µρ1 (a) for every a ∈ D 2,2,2 .                    (2.7)
Let ∇ : R −→ X0 be a projection, ∇ : (η1 , η2 , η3 ) −→ Σηi . Then ker ∇ = X01 .
     Lemma 2.2.1. For every a ∈ D 2,2,2 and for every subspace B ⊆ R, we have
                                 ∇(ν 0 (a)B) = ∇(ν 0 (a))∇(B).                            (2.8)
     Proof. The inclusion
                                  ∇(ν 0 (a)B) ⊆ ∇(ν 0 (a))∇(B)
is clear, because ν 0 (a)B ⊆ ν 0 (a) and ν 0 (a)B ⊆ B. Conversely, let z ∈ ∇(ν 0 (a))∇(B), then
there exist vectors
                         u ∈ ν 0 (a) and v ∈ B such that ∇(u) = ∇(v).                     (2.9)
According to (2.5)
                                         ν 0 (a) = X01 + A
for some subspace A ⊆ R. From (2.9), we have
                     v − u = w ∈ ker ∇ = X01 , i.e.,
                     v = u + w ∈ X01 + A = ν 0 (a), and hence v ∈ ν 0 (a)B.
Thus, z = ∇(v) ∈ ∇(ν 0 (a)B) and (2.8) is proved. 
     From (2.8) it follows that the map ∇ : R −→ R/X01 gives a representation by the formula
                                         a 7−→ ∇(ν 0 (a)).
We have
                         ∇(ν 0 (yi )) = ∇Gi = Yi = ρ(yi ),        i = 1, 2, 3,          (2.10)

                         ∇(ν 0 (xi )) = ∇Hi = Xi = ρ(xi ),         i = 1, 2, 3,         (2.11)

                             ∇(ν 0 (a)) = ρ(a) for every a ∈ D 2,2,2.                   (2.12)

                               2.3. The elementary maps ϕi
     Following [GP74], we introduce the linear maps
                               ϕi : X01 −→ X0 , (η1 , η2 , η3 ) 7−→ ηi .
Let πi be a projection R on Gi . Then
                                            ϕi = ∇πi µ.                                 (2.13)
It follows from the definition that
                                        ϕ1 + ϕ2 + ϕ3 = 0.                               (2.14)
From (2.14) we immediately deduce that
                            ϕ1 B + ϕ2 B = ϕ1 B + ϕ3 B = ϕ1 B + ϕ2 B                     (2.15)
for every subspace B ⊆ X01 .

                                    ψi (a) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (a)).                        (2.16)
The map ψi is said to be a joint map.
   Proposition 2.4.1. The joint maps ψi satisfy the following basic relations:
    (1) ψi (xi ) = X01 ,
    (2) ψi (xj ) = ψk (xj ) = ν 0 (yi yk ),
    (3) ψi (yi ) = ν 0 (xi (yj + yk )),
    (4) ψi (yj ) = ν 0 (yi (xj + yk )),
    (5) ψi (I) = ν 0 (yi (yj + yk )),
    (6) ψi (yj yk ) = ν 0 (yi (xj + xk )).

    Proof. 1) From (2.6) and (2.16), we have ψi (xi ) = X01 + Gi Hi′ . Since Gi Hi′ = 0, we have
ψi (xi ) = X01 .
   2) From (2.6) and (2.16), we have ψi (xj ) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + X01 Hj′ ). Since Hj′ = Gi + Gk
(where i, j, k are distinct), it follows that
                           ψi (xj ) = X01 + Gi (Gj + Gk + X01 (Gi + Gk )).
By the permutation property (A.4)
    ψi (xj ) = X01 + Gi (X01 + (Gj + Gk )(Gi + Gk )) = X01 + Gi (X01 + Gk + Gj (Gi + Gk )).
Since Gj (Gi + Gk ) = 0, it follows that
               ψi (xj ) = X01 + Gi (X01 + Gk ) = (X01 + Gi )(X01 + Gk ) = ν 0 (yi yk ).
                                                                      ′         ′
     3) As above, ψi (yi ) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + X01 G′i ). Since Hi ⊆ Gi , and by the modular law
(A.3), we have ψi (yi ) = X01 + Gi G′i (Hi′ + X01 ). Since Gi G′i = Hi and Hj′ = Gi + Gk (where
i, j, k are distinct), we have
     ψi (yi ) = X01 + Hi′(Gj + Gk + X01 ) = (X01 + Hi′ )(Gj + Gk + X01 ) = ν 0 (xi (yj + yk )).

   4) Again, ψi (yj ) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + X01G′j ). From Gi ⊆ G′j for i 6= j and by the permutation
property (A.4), we have
                                 ψi (yj ) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ G′j + X01 ).
Since Hi′ G′j = Hj + Gk , we have
     ψi (yj ) = X01 + Gi (X01 + Hj + Gk ) = (X01 + Gi )(X01 + Hj + Gk ) = ν 0 (yi (xj + yk )).

   5) Similarly,
                    ψi (I) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + X01 ) = X01 + Gi (Gj + Gk + X01 ) =
                    (X01 + Gi )(Gj + Gk + X01 ) = ν 0 (yi (yj + yk )).
   6) As above,
                                 ψi (yj yk ) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + X01 G′j G′k ).
34         2. ELEMENTARY MAPS ϕi , ATOMIC, ADMISSIBLE,CUMULATIVE POLYNOMIALS

From G′j G′k = Hj + Hk + Gi and by the permutation (A.4), we have
                     ψi (yj yk ) = X01 + Gi ((Gj + Gk )(Hj + Hk + Gi ) + X01 ) =
                     X01 + Gi (Hj + Hk + Gi (Gj + Gk ) + X01 ).
The intersection vanishes: Gi (Gj + Gk ) = 0, and hence
                   ψi (yj yk ) = X01 + Gi (Hj + Hk + X01 ) = ν 0 (yi (xj + xk )). 

   Remark 2.4.2 (The lattice description of the projection, [GP74]). If π : R −→ R is a
projection, and A is a subspace of R, then
                                        πA = Imπ(ker π + A).                                 (2.17)
Indeed,
                v ∈ Imπ(ker π + A) =⇒ v = πv ∈ π(ker π + A),                i.e., v ∈ πA.
Conversely,
          v ∈ πA =⇒ v ∈ Imπ, besides v = πv =⇒ πv ∈ πA =⇒ v ∈ ker π + A. 

    Proposition 2.4.3 (A relation between the ϕi and ψi ). The following properties establish
a relation between the ϕi and ψi :
     (1) Let a, b ⊆ D 2,2,2 . If ψi (a) = ν 0 (b), then ϕi Φ+ ρ(a) = ρ(b).
      (2) Let c ⊆ D 2,2,2 . Then ∇ψi (c) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(c).
      (3) Let a, b, c ⊆ D 2,2,2 . If ψi (a) = ν 0 (b) and ψi (ac) = ψi (a)ψi (c), then

                                  ϕi Φ+ ρ(ac) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(a)ϕi Φ+ ρ(c).                        (2.18)


    Proof. (1) From (2.13) we deduce that ϕi Φ+ ρ(a) = ∇πi µΦ+ ρ(a). By (2.7), we have
                                                                ′
ϕi Φ+ ρ(a) = ∇πi ν 1 (a). By (2.17) for Imπi = Gi and ker πi = Hi , we have
                                                        ′
                                      πi ν 1 (a) = Gi (Hi + ν 1 (a)),
and
                             ′                               ′
      ∇πi ν 1 (a) = ∇(Gi (Hi + ν 1 (a))) = ∇(X01 + Gi (Hi + ν 1 (a))) = ∇(ψi (a)) = ∇(ν 0 (b)).
From (2.12) ∇(ψi (a) = ρ(b).
     (2) By definition (2.16) of ψi , we have
                                 ∇ψi (c) = ∇(X01 + Gi (Hi ′ + ν 1 (c))).
Since X01 ⊆ ker ∇, we have ∇ψi (c) = ∇(Gi (Hi ′ + ν 1 (c)). By lattice description of the
projection (2.17), we have ∇ψi (c) = ∇(πi ν 1 (c)). By (2.7) ∇ψi (c) = ∇(πi µΦ+ ρ(c)). Finally,
by definition (2.13) of ϕi , we have ∇ψi (c) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(c).
     (3) By the hypothesis ψi (ac) = ν 0 (a)ψi (c). By Lemma 2.2.1 and eq.(2.8), we have
                                      ∇ψi (ac) = ∇ψi (a)∇ψi (c).
The proof follows from (2). 

     From Propositions 2.4.1, 2.4.3 we have
     Corollary 2.4.4. For the elementary map ϕi , the following basic relations hold:

     (1) ϕi Φ+ ρ(xi ) = 0,
     (2) ϕi Φ+ ρ(xj ) = ϕk Φ+ ρ(xj ) = ρ(yi yk ),
     (3) ϕi Φ+ ρ(yi ) = ρ(xi (yj + yk )),
     (4) ϕi Φ+ ρ(yj ) = ρ(yi (xj + yk )),
     (5) ϕi Φ+ ρ(I) = ρ(yi (yj + yk )),
     (6) ϕi Φ+ ρ(yj yk ) = ρ(yi (xj + xk )).
                                                                                                            ′
    Proof. It is necessary to explain only (1). Since the ith coordinate in the space Hi is 0,
it follows that
                                                                                   ′
                    ϕi Φ+ ρ(xi ) = ∇πi µΦ+ ρ(xi ) = ∇πi ν 1 (xi ) = ∇πi (X01 Hi ) = 0. 
                    2.5. Additivity and multiplicativity of the joint maps ψi
    Proposition 2.5.1. The map ψi is additive and quasimultiplicative1 with respect to the
lattice operations + and ∩. The following relations hold for every a, b ∈ D 2,2,2 :
      (1) ψi (a) + ψi (b) = ψi (a + b),
     (2) ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi ((a + xi )(b + xj xk )),
     (3) ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi (a(b + xi + xj xk )).

    Proof. 1) By the modular law (A.3)
    ψi (a) + ψi (b) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (a)) + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (b)) =
                                                                                              
    X01 + Gi Hi′ + ν 1 (a) + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (b)) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (b))(Hi′ + Gi ) + ν 1 (a) .
           ′
Since Hi + Gi = R, it follows that
                                                                 
               ψi (a) + ψi (b) = X01 + Gi Hi′ + ν 1 (b) + ν 1 (a) = X01 + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (b + a)).

    2) By definition (2.6) ν 1 (b) ⊆ X01 , and by the permutation property (A.5) we have
                              X01 + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (a)) = X01 + Hi′ (Gi + ν 1 (a)).
By the modular law (A.3) and by (A.5) we have
                    ψi (a)ψi (b) =
                                                                       
                     X01 + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (a)) X01 + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (b)) =
                                                                     
                    X01 + Gi (Hi′ + ν 1 (a)) X01 + Hi′ (Gi + ν 1 (b)) .
Further,                                                                               
                       ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi X01 (Hi′ + ν 1 (a)) + Hi′ (Gi + ν 1 (b)) .
Since
                      X01 (Hi′ + ν 1 (a)) = X01 Hi′ + ν 1 (a)    and       X01 Hi′ = ν 1 (xi ),
we have                                                                         
                ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi ν 1 (xi ) + ν 1 (a) + Hi′ (Gi + ν 1 (b)) .                         (2.19)
By the permutation property (A.4) and by (2.19) we have
                                                                                 
               ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi Hi′ + (ν 1 (xi ) + ν 1 (a))(Gi + ν 1 (b)) .                         (2.20)
    1The  map ψi is multiplicative if ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi (ab). We will say that ψi is quasimultiplicative if
element ab in this relation is a little deformed, or more exactly, if ab is deformed to (a + xi )(b + xj xk ) or to
a(b + xi + xj xk ) as in (2) and (3) of Proposition 2.5.1.
36         2. ELEMENTARY MAPS ϕi , ATOMIC, ADMISSIBLE,CUMULATIVE POLYNOMIALS

Since
            Gi = Hj′ Hk′      and     ν 1 (xi ) + ν 1 (a) = ν 1 (xi + a) = X01 (ν 1 (xi + a)),
it follows that
                                                                                  
               ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi Hi′ + ν 1 (xi + a)(X01 Hj′ Hk′ + ν 1 (b)) =
                                                                   
               X01 + Gi Hi′ + ν 1 (xi + a)(ν 1 (xj xk ) + ν 1 (b)) =
                                                           
               X01 + Gi Hi′ + ν 1 (xi + a)ν 1 (xj xk + b) = ψi ((a + xi )(b + xj xk )).
     3) From (2.19) and since ν 1 (xi ) = X01 Hi′ ⊆ Hi′ , we have
                                                                                   
                    ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi ν 1 (a) + Hi′(Gi + ν 1 (b) + ν 1 (xi )) .            (2.21)
Again, by (A.4) we have
                                                                                  
                   ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi Hi′ + ν 1 (a)(Gi + ν 1 (b) + ν 1 (xi )) =
                                                                            
                   X01 + Gi Hi′ + ν 1 (a)(X01 Hj′ Hk′ + ν 1 (b) + ν 1 (xi )) .
Thus, ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi (a(b + xi + xj xk )). 

     Corollary 2.5.2 (Atomic multiplicativity). 1) Let one of the following inclusions hold:
                             (i) xi + xj xk ⊆ a,
                                     (ii)    xi + xj xk ⊆ b,
                                     (iii)   xj ⊆ a,      xj xk ⊆ b,
                                     (iv)    xi ⊆ b,      xj xk ⊆ a.
Then the joint map ψi operates as a homomorphism on the elements a and b with respect to
the lattice operations + and ∩, i.e.,
                       ψi (a) + ψi (b) = ψi (a + b), ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi (a)ψi (b).
2) The joint map ψi applied to the following atomic elements is the intersection preserving
map, i.e., multiplicative with respect to the operation ∩:
                                                                       2,2,2
                            ψi (baij               ij
                                  n ) = ψi (b)ψi (an ) for every b ⊆ D       ,                   (2.22)

                                                                       2,2,2
                            ψj (baij               ij
                                  n ) = ψj (b)ψj (an ) for every b ⊆ D       ,                   (2.23)

                                                                    2,2,2
                      ψi (bAij                 ij
                              n ) = ψi (b)ψi (An ) for every b ⊆ D        .         (2.24)
3) The element xi can be inserted in any additive expression under the action of the joint
map ψi :
                          ψi (b + xi ) = ψi (b) for every b ⊆ D 2,2,2 .             (2.25)
     Proof. 1) Follows from Proposition 2.5.1.
     2) Let us consider aij
                         n . For n ≥ 2, we have
                               jk
                 aij                                   ki                       ki
                  n = xi + yj an−1 = xi + yj (xj + yk an−2 ) = xi + xj + yj yk an−2 ,

thus aij                                             ij
      n ⊇ xi + xj . Now, we consider atomic element An . For n ≥ 2, we have
                                                           ji
                     Aij           ki
                      n = yi + xj An−1 = yi + xj (yk + xi An−2 ) ⊇ xi + xj xk .

For n = 1, the relation is proved directly.
     3) Follows from Corollary 2.4.4, (1) since we have
                       ψi (b + xi ) = ψi (b) + ψi (xi ) and ψi (xi ) = X01 ⊆ ψi (b)

    The basic properties of atomic elements are given in Table 2.1. These properties, which
will be used in further considerations. For convenience, we also give definition of aij         ij
                                                                                           n , An
in relations (1.1)–(1.2) of Table 2.1. Indices i, j, k in Table 2.1 are distinct and {i, j, k} =
{1, 2, 3}. Properties 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2 from Table 2.1 mean that atomic elements aij n
and Ajin coincide for many lattice polynomials and can substitute one another in many cases.


    Proof of Properties 2.1 – 8.2 (Table 2.1).
    2.1) First, aij             jk     ij           jk                      jk     jk
                 n−1 = xi + yj an−2 , an = xi + yj an−1 . By induction, if an−2 ⊇ an−1 , then
aij      ij                        ij       ij
 n−1 ⊇ an . For n = 1, we have a0 = I ⊇ a1 . Further,

                aij                    ki                       ki
                 n = xi + yj (xj + yk an−2 ) = xi + xj + yj yk an−2 ⊇ xi + xj . 

   2.2) Similarly,
                            Aij             ki             ki     ij
                             n−1 = yi + xj An−2 ⊇ yi + xj An−1 = An . 

   3.1) By the induction hypothesis xj Aki        ik
                                        n−1 = xj an−1 , then

                              xk Aij               ki                   ik
                                  n = xk (yi + xj An−1 ) = xk (yi + xj an−1 ).

By property 1.1 from Table 2.1 we have aik
                                         n−1 ⊇ xk , thus by the permutation property (A.4)
we deduce
                          xk Aij               ik          ji
                              n = xk (xj + yi an−1 ) = xk an . 

   3.2) By property 3.1 from Table 2.1 we have Aij           ki             ik
                                                n = yi + xj An−1 = yi + xj an−1 . 
38         2. ELEMENTARY MAPS ϕi , ATOMIC, ADMISSIBLE,CUMULATIVE POLYNOMIALS

     4.1) We have
                                                  kj                               ji
                       yi yj aik
                              n = yi yj (xi + yk an−1 ) = yi yj (xi + yk (xk + yj an−2 )),

i.e.,
                                                                      ji
                                   yi yj aik
                                          n = yi yj (xi + xk + yk yj an−2 )).                       (2.26)
On the other hand,
                                               jk                               ij
                      yi yj Aki
                             n = yij (yk + xi An−1 ) = yi yj (yk + xi (yj + xk An−2 )).

Since Aij
       n−2 ⊇ xi , we have by the permutation property (A.4):
                                                                      ij
                                  yi yj Aki
                                         n = yi yj (yk + xi (xk + yj An−2 )).

Further, since yj Aij
                   n−2 ⊇ yi yj , again, by (A.4), we have
                                                      ij                               ij
                  yi yj Aki
                         n = yi yj (xi + yk (xk + yj An−2 )) = yi yj (xi + xk + yk yj An−2 ).

By the induction hypothesis
                                                                       ji
                                    yi yj Aki
                                           n = yi yj (xi + xk + yk yj an−2 )

and by (2.26) we have yi yj Aki         ik
                             n = yi yj an . 

     4.2) By property 4.1 we have
          yi aij                 jk                jk              kj               kj
              n+1 = yi (xi + yj an ) = xi + yi yj an = xi + yi yj An = yi (xi + yj An ). 

     5.1) By property 2.1 and (A.4) we have
                                               jk                  jk
                             aij jk                  jk                  jk
                              n am = (xi + yj an−1 )am = (yj + xi an−1 )am .
                                  kj
By property 3.1 aij jk                  jk   ji jk
                 n am = (yj + xi An−1 )am = An am . 

     5.2) We have
                                                                        jk
                               yi (xj + xk )aij
                                             n = yi (xj + xk )(xi + yj an−1 ).
Since ajk
       n−1 ⊇ xj + xk , it follows that
                                                                     jk
                            yi (xj + xk )aij
                                          n = yi (xj + xk )(yj + xi an−1 ) =

                            yi (xj + xk )(yj + xi Akj                    ji
                                                   n−1 ) = yi (xj + xk )An . 

     6.1) Since yi aij     ij
                    m−1 ⊆ An , it follows that
                                                ij                  ij
                           Aij ki   ij                      ij
                            n am = An (xk + yi am−1 ) = xk An + yi am−1 . 

     6.2) Since xj Aki     jk
                    n−1 ⊆ am , it follows that

                           Aij jk   jk          ki          jk      ki
                            n am = am (yi + xj An−1 ) = yi am + xj An−1 . 

     7.1) Since
          yi (xj + xk ) + yi yj aik                         ik                            ik
                                 n−2 = yi (xj + xk + yi yj an−2 ) = yi (xk + yj (xj + yi an−2 )),

by definition (1.1, Table 2.1) we have yi (xk + yj (xj + yi aik           kj
                                                             n−2 )) = yi an . 

     7.2) As above, using the modular law (A.3) and the permutation property (A.4) we have
            yi yj + yi (xj + xk )Aki                   ki
                                  n−2 = yi ((xj + xk )An−2 + yi yj ) =

by property 4.1 we have

                2.7. Action of the maps ψi and ϕi on atomic elements
    Proposition 2.7.1 (Action of joint maps on atomic elements). The joint maps ψi applied
to the atomic elements aij           ij
                            n and An (n ≥ 1) satisfy the following relations:
                     0
     (1) ψi (aij            kj
              n ) = ν (yi An ),
                    (
              ij      ν 0 (yj Akj
                               n )         for n > 1,
     (2) ψj (an ) =     0               kj
                      ν (yj (yi + yk )A1 ) for n = 1,
                        0     ji
     (3) ψk (yi aij
                 n ) = ν (yk An+1 ),
                     0
     (4) ψi (Aij                     ik
              n ) = ν (yi (yj + yk )an ),
                        0
     (5) ψj (yk Aij                     ik
                 n ) = ν (yj (xk + yi )an ),
                        0     ji
     (6) ψk (yj Aij
                 n ) = ν (yk an+1 ).


   Remark 2.7.2. The joint map ψk increases the lower index n of the atomic element and
swaps indices i and j in headings (3) and (6). The new atomic elements appear in this way.
                                       ij =⇒ ji,    n =⇒ n + 1.
In headings (1) and (2), the lower index n does not grow and the upper pair ij becomes
kj. The first index of the pair is changed and the atomic elements “a” are transformed to
atomic elements “A”:
                                    ij =⇒ kj,   a =⇒ A.
In headings (4) and (5), the lower index n does not grow and the upper pair ij becomes ik.
The second index of the pair is changed and the atomic elements “A” are transformed to
atomic elements “a”:
                                    ij =⇒ ik,   A =⇒ a.
Map ψk transforms a =⇒ A in headings (1), (2), (3) and A =⇒ a in headings (4), (5), (6).
   Remark 2.7.3. It is not so interesting to consider ψj (Aij
                                                           n ) because

                                ψj (Aij                 ki
                                     n ) = ψj (yi + xj An ) = ψj (yi ).

By basic relations (Proposition 2.4.1) ψj (yi ) = ν 0 (yj (xi + yk )).
   For further moving of indices, see §2.11-§2.12 devoted to the admissible elements.
   Proof Proposition 2.7.1 uses a simultaneous induction on (1)–(6). For convenience, with-
out loss of generality, we let i = 1, j = 2.
   1) For n = 1, by Proposition 2.4.1 we have
                ψ1 (a12                                0                   0     32
                     1 ) = ψ1 (x1 + y2 ) = ψ1 (y2 ) = ν (y1 (x2 + y3 )) = ν (y1 A1 ).
40         2. ELEMENTARY MAPS ϕi , ATOMIC, ADMISSIBLE,CUMULATIVE POLYNOMIALS

For n ≥ 2, by Corollary 2.4.4 we have
                              ψ1 (a12                 23              23
                                   n ) = ψ1 (x1 + y2 an−1 ) = ψ1 (y2 an−1 ).
Since
                            y2 a23                 31                 31
                                n−1 = y2 (x2 + y3 an−2 ) = x2 + y2 y3 n−2
and a31
     n−2   ⊇ x1 , we see by multiplicativity (Corollary 2.5.2) that
                                ψ1 (a12                               31
                                     n ) = ψ1 (x2 ) + ψ1 (y2 y3 )ψ1 (an−2 ).
By basic relations (Proposition 2.4.1)
                           ψ1 (a12     0            0                    31
                                n ) = ν (y1 y3 ) + ν (y1 (x2 + x3 ))ψ1 (an−2 ).

By the induction hypothesis from (2) we have ψ1 (a31       0     21
                                                  n−2 ) = ν (y1 An−2 ) and

                                ψ1 (a12     0                       21
                                     n ) = ν (y1 y3 + y1 (x2 + x3 )An−2 ).

By property 7.2 from Table 2.1 we have
                                        ψ1 (a12     0     32
                                             n ) = ν (y1 An ). 

     2) For n = 1, we have
                       ψ2 (a12                           0
                            1 ) = ψ2 (x1 ) + ψ2 (y2 ) = ν (y2 y3 + x2 (y1 + y3 )) =

                       ν 0 (y2 (y1 + y3 )(y3 + x2 )) = ν 0 (y2 (y1 + y3 )A32
                                                                          1 ).

For n ≥ 2, we have ψ2 (a12                       23
                        n ) = ψ2 (x1 ) + ψ2 (y2 an−1 ). By the multiplicativity property (Corol-
lary 2.5.2) we have
                            ψ2 (a12      0                       23
                                 n ) = ν (y2 y3 ) + ψ2 (y2 )ψ2 (an−1 ).
By the induction hypothesis, from (1) we have ψ2 (a23             0     13
                                                        n−1 ) = ν (y2 An−1 ) and

                                ψ2 (a12                             13
                                     n ) = ν0 (y2 y3 + x2 (y1 + y3 An−1 )).

Since A13
       n−1 ⊆ y1 + y3 , we see that

             ψ2 (a12     0             13       0              13        0     32
                  n ) = ν (y2 y3 + x2 An−1 ) = ν (y2 (y3 + x2 An−1 )) = ν (y2 An ). 

     3) We have
                       ψ3 (y1a12                     23                       23
                              n ) = ψ3 (y1 (x1 + y2 an−1 )) = ψ3 (x1 + y1 y2 an−1 ).

Further, by multiplicativity (Corollary 2.5.2) we have
                               ψ3 (y1 a12                               23
                                       n ) = ψ3 (x1 ) + ψ3 (y1 y2 )ψ3 (an−1 ).

From basic relations (Proposition 2.4.1) it follows that
                          ψ3 (y1 a12     0            0                    23
                                  n ) = ν (y3 y2 ) + ν (y3 (x1 + x2 ))ψ3 (an−1 ).

By induction, from (2) ψ3 (y1 a12      0                       13
                                n ) = ν (y3 y2 + y3 (x1 + x2 )An−1 ). Again, from Table 2.1,
                             12      0    21
property 7.2 we have ψ3 (y1 an ) = ν (y3 An+1 ). In this case ψk increases the lower index of
the atomic element aij
                    n. 

     4) As above,
                        ψ1 (A12                 31                         31
                             n ) = ψ1 (y1 + x2 An−1 ) = ψ1 (y1 ) + ψ1 (x2 An−1 ).

From Table 2.1, property 3.1 we have
                    ψ1 (A12                       13                              13
                         n ) = ψ1 (y1 ) + ψ1 (x2 an−1 ) = ψ1 (y1 ) + ψ1 (x2 )ψ1 (an−1 ).

By basic relations (Proposition 2.4.1) and by induction hypothesis, from (1) we have
                                ψ1 (A12     0                        23
                                     n ) = ν (x1 (y2 + y3 ) + y1 y3 An−1 ).
                                  2.8. ϕi −HOMOMORPHIC THEOREM                                          41

From Table 2.1, property 8.1 we have
                                 ψ1 (A12     0               13
                                      n ) = ν (y1 (y2 + y3 )an ). 


   5) Again, ψ2 (y3A12                     31                   31
                    n ) = ψ2 (y3 (y1 +x2 An−1 )). Since y3 ⊆ An−1 , we have by the permutation
property (A.4):
                              ψ2 (y3 A12                     31
                                      n ) = ψ2 (y3 (x2 + y1 An−1 )).

By (2.22)-(2.25) and Corollary 2.5.2 we have
                ψ2 (y3 A12                                31                       31
                        n ) = ψ2 (y3 )(ψ2 (x2 ) + ψ2 (y1 An−1 )) = ψ2 (y3 )ψ2 (y1 An−1 ).

By the induction hypothesis, from (6) it follows that
                                  ψ2 (y3 A12     0               13
                                          n ) = ν (y2 (x3 + y1 )an ))

because ψ2 (y1 A31       0     13
                n−1 ) = ν (y2 an ). 

   6) We have
    ψ2 (y1 A31                     23                       32                                 32
            n ) = ψ2 (y1 (y3 + x1 An−1 )) = ψ2 (y1 y3 + x1 an−1 ) = ψ2 (y1 y3 ) + ψ2 (x1 )ψ2 (an−1 ).

By the induction hypothesis, from (2) it follows that
                             ψ2 (y1 A31     0                        12
                                     n ) = ν (y2 (x1 + x3 ) + y2 y3 An−1 ).

From Table 2.1, property 4.1 we have
                             ψ2 (y1 A31     0                        21
                                     n ) = ν (y2 (x1 + x3 ) + y2 y3 an−1 ).

Finally, from Table 2.1, property 7.1 ψ2 (y1 A31     0     13
                                              n ) = ν (y2 an+1 ). In this case ψk increases the
                                     ij
lower index of the atomic element An . 
   From Propositions (2.4.3) and (2.7.1) we have
    Corollary 2.7.4 (Action of the elementary maps). The elementary maps ϕi applied to
the atomic elements aij     ij
                     n and An (n ≥ 1) satisfy the following relations:

    (1) ϕi Φ+ ρ(aij          kj
                 n ) = ρ(yi An ),
                        (
                         ρ(yj Akj
                                n )          for n > 1,
    (2) ϕj Φ+ ρ(aij
                 n  ) =                  kj
                         ρ(yj (yi + yk )A1 ) for n = 1,
                                ji
    (3) ϕk Φ+ ρ(yi aij
                    n ) = ρ(yk An+1 ),

    (4) ϕi Φ+ ρ(Aij                    ik
                 n ) = ρ(yi (yj + yk )an ),

    (5) ϕj Φ+ ρ(yk Aij                    ik
                    n ) = ρ(yj (xk + yi )an ),
                                ji
    (6) ϕk Φ+ ρ(yj Aij
                    n ) = ρ(yk an+1 ).



                               2.8. ϕi −homomorphic theorem
   Theorem 2.8.1. 1) The polynomials aij
                                      n are ϕi − and ϕj −homomorphic.

   2) The polynomials Aij
                       n are ϕi −homomorphic.

   3) The polynomials Aij
                       n are (ϕj , yk )−homomorphic.
42         2. ELEMENTARY MAPS ϕi , ATOMIC, ADMISSIBLE,CUMULATIVE POLYNOMIALS

    Proof. 1),2) Follow from multiplicativity (2.22) – (2.24), Proposition 2.7.1 and Proposition
2.4.3. 
   3) For convenience, without loss of generality, we let i = 1, j = 2, k = 3. We need to
prove that
                 ϕ2 Φ+ ρ(A12          +     12     +
                          n p) = ϕ2 Φ ρ(y3 An )ϕ2 Φ ρ(p) for every p ⊆ y3 .        (2.27)
           12                   31                       31
Since ψ2 (An p) = ψ2 ((y1 + x2 An−1 )p) and p ⊆ y3 ⊆ An−1 , we have by the permutation
property (A.4):
                    ψ2 (A12                   31                     31
                         n p) = ψ2 ((x2 + y1 An−1 )p) = ψ2 (x2 + y1 An−1 )ψ2 (p).

The element x2 can be dropped according to (2.25), and hence,
                                   ψ2 (A12             31
                                        n p) = ψ2 (y1 An−1 )ψ2 (p).

     By property (6) from Proposition 2.7.1 we have
                                     ψ2 (A12      0     13
                                          n p) = ν (y2 an )ψ2 (p).                        (2.28)
Since y2 a13                13             0   13      0                0 13
          n = y2 (y1 + y3 )an , we have ν (y2 a n ) = ν (y2 (y1 + y3 ))ν (an ) and by (5) from
                               0   13           0 13
Proposition 2.4.1 we have ν (y2 an ) = ψ2 (I)ν (an ). Further, ψ2 (I) ⊇ ψ2 (p) and (2.28) is
equivalent to
                                   ψ2 (A12       0 13
                                        n p) = ν (an )ψ2 (p).                            (2.29)
We have ψ2 (p) ⊆ ψ2 (y3 ) together with p ⊆ y3 , and therefore ψ2 (p) = ψ2 (p)ψ2 (y3 ). From
(2.29) and Proposition 2.4.1 we have
                     ψ2 (A12      0 13
                          n p) = ν (an )ψ2 (p)ψ2 (y3 ) =

                     ν 0 (a13        0                   0               13
                           n )ψ2 (p)ν (y2 (x1 + y3 )) = ν (y2 (x1 + y3 )an )ψ2 (p).

By (5) from Proposition 2.7.1 ψ2 (A12                12
                                      n p) = ψ2 (y3 An )ψ2 (p). Applying projection ∇ from §2.2
we get
                               ∇ψ2 (A12                 12
                                       n p) = ∇ψ2 (y3 An )∇ψ2 (p)                        (2.30)
                12     0               13
because ψ2 (y3 An ) = ν (y2 (x1 + y3 )an ), see Lemma 2.2.1, relation (2.8).
   By Proposition 2.4.3 ∇ψi (c) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(c) for every c ⊆ D 2,2,2 , thus we get (2.27), and
therefore heading (3) of the ϕ−homomorphic Theorem 2.8.1 is proven. 
    The final proposition of this section shows when the lower indices of atomic elements are
increased by action some elementary mappings ϕi :
     Corollary 2.8.2. The index growth takes place in the following cases:
                                  ji
      (1) ϕk Φ+ ρ(yi aij
                      n ) = ρ(yk An+1 );
                                  ji
      (2) ϕk Φ+ ρ(yj aij
                      n ) = ρ(yk an+1 ).


                                 2.9. The perfectness of yi + yj
     To prove the perfectness of the element y1 + y2 , two simple lemmas are necessary.
   Lemma 2.9.1. Let A, B ⊆ X, A, B be subspaces in the finite-dimensional vector space X.
There exists a subspace C ⊆ B, such that
                                     C + AB = B and CA = 0.                               (2.31)

then v ∈ CA ⊆ BA and the sum C + AB is not direct. 

    Lemma 2.9.2. If U, V, W ⊆ X and (U + V )W = 0, then
                           U(V + W ) = UV and V (U + W ) = UV.                             (2.32)
    Indeed,
                  U(V + W ) ⊆ (U + V )(V + W ) = (U + V )W + V = V,
i.e., U(V + W ) ⊆ UV . The inverse inclusion is obvious. Similarly,
                   V (U + W ) ⊆ (U + V )(U + W ) = U + W (U + V ) = U,
i.e., V (U + W ) ⊆ UV and the inverse inclusion is obvious. 

    Proposition 2.9.3. 1) The element yi + yj where i 6= j, is perfect in D 2,2,2 .
   2) If ρ(yi + yj ) = 0 for some indecomposable representation ρ, where i 6= j, then ρ is one
from the seven projective representations (Table A.1).

   Proof. 1) Consider y1 + y2 . Let B = X3 , A = Y1 + Y2 in (2.31), then there exists a
subspace C ⊆ X3 such that
                          C + X3 (Y1 + Y2 ) = X3 ,     C(Y1 + Y2 ) = 0.                    (2.33)
Therefore Y3 ⊇ C + Y3 (Y1 + Y2 ). Again use (2.31) with
                                 B = Y3 , A = C + Y3 (Y1 + Y2 ).
Then, there exists a subspace D ⊆ Y3 such that
                   D + C + Y3 (Y1 + Y2 ) = Y3 ,      D[C + Y3 (Y1 + Y2 )] = 0.             (2.34)
Using (2.32) with U = Y3 (Y1 + Y2 ), V = C and W = D, we obtain from (2.32) and (2.34):
                     U(V + W ) = Y3 (Y1 + Y2 )(C + D) = CY3 (Y1 + Y2 ).
By (2.33) we have Y3 (Y1 +Y2)(C +D) = 0. Since D+C ⊆ Y3 , we see that (Y1 +Y2 )(C +D) = 0.
Therefore, D + C and Y1 + Y2 form a direct sum. We complement this sum to X0 :
                                (D + C) ⊕ (Y1 + Y2 ) ⊕ F = X0 .                            (2.35)
We will show that the decomposition (2.35) forms a decomposition of the representation ρ
in X0 .
   First,
                 Z = Z(Y1 + Y2 ) + Z(D + C + F ) for Z = Y1 , Y2 , X1 , X2        (2.36)
because Z ⊆ Y1 + Y2 and the sum (2.35) is direct. By (2.33) we have
                         X3 ⊆ X3 (Y1 + Y2 ) + X3 (D + C + F ) ⊆ X3 ,
i.e.,
                           X3 = X3 (Y1 + Y2 ) + X3 (D + C + F ).                           (2.37)
Similarly, by (2.34) we have
                           Y3 ⊆ Y3 (Y1 + Y2 ) + Y3 (D + C + F ) ⊆ Y3 ,
i.e.,
                              Y3 = Y3 (Y1 + Y2 ) + Y3 (D + C + F ).                         (2.38)
So, by (2.36)–(2.38) Y1 + Y2 and D + C + F form a decomposition of the representation ρ.
Since ρ(y1 + y2 ) = Y1 + Y2 , we have either ρ(y1 + y2 ) = X0 or ρ(y1 + y2 ) = 0, i.e., y1 + y2 is
a perfect element. 
    2) If ρ(y1 + y2 ) = 0, then Y1 = X1 = Y2 = X2 = 0 and ρ is one of ρx0 , ρy3 , ρx3 , see Table

     Corollary 2.9.4. The elements y1 + y2 + x3 and y1 + y2 + y3 are perfect.
   Proof. Let Y1 + Y2 = X0 . Then Y1 + Y2 + X3 = X0 . If Y1 + Y2 = 0, then, in the
indecomposable representation ρ : D 2,2,2 −→ L(X0 ), we have X0 = Y3 = X3 . The same for
the element y1 + y2 + y3 .
   If ρ(y1 + y2 ) = 0, then Y1 = X1 = Y2 = X2 = 0 and ρ is one of ρx0 , ρy3 , ρx3 , see Table

      2.10. The elementary map ϕi : a way to construct new perfect elements
    In this section we list three fundamental properties of the elementary map ϕi . Proposition
2.10.1 gives a way to construct new perfect elements from already existing ones. Proposition
2.10.2 motivates the construction of admissible sequences and admissible elements.
    Proposition 2.10.1. Let z be a perfect element in D 2,2,2 and, for every indecomposable
representation ρ, let
                           ϕi Φ+ ρ(z) + ϕj Φ+ ρ(z) = ρ(u), where i 6= j.                  (2.39)
Then u is also the perfect element.
     Proof. If Φ+ ρ(z) = 0, then ρ(u) = 0. If Φ+ ρ(z) = X01 , then by Corollary 2.4.4 we have
                    ρ(u) = ϕi X01 + ϕj X01 = ϕi Φ+ ρ(I) + ϕj Φ+ ρ(I) =
                    Yi (Yj + Yk ) + Yj (Yi + Yk ) = (Yi + Yj )(Yi + Yk )(Yj + Yk )
and by Proposition 2.9.3 the element u is also perfect. 
     Proposition 2.10.2. For {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, the following relations hold
                                         ϕi ϕj ϕi + ϕi ϕk ϕi = 0,                         (2.40)



                                                 ϕ3i = 0.                                 (2.41)
    Proof. For every vector v ∈ X01 , by definition of ϕi we have (ϕi + ϕj + ϕk )(v) = 0, see eq.
(2.14). In other words, ϕi + ϕj + ϕk = 0. Therefore,

                            ϕi ϕj ϕi + ϕi ϕk ϕi = ϕi (ϕj + ϕk )ϕi = −ϕ3i .
So, it suffices to prove that ϕ3i = 0. For every z ⊆ D 2,2,2 , by headings (1),(3) and (5) of
Corollary 2.4.4 we have
                 ϕ3i ((Φ+ )3 ρ)(z) ⊆ ϕ2i [ϕi ((Φ+ )3 ρ)(I)] =
                 ϕ2i [((Φ+ )2 ρ)(yi (yj + yk ))] ⊆ ϕ2i [((Φ+ )2 ρ)(yi )] =
                 ϕi [(Φ+ ρ)(xi (yj + yk ))] ⊆ ϕi [(Φ+ ρ)(xi )] = ϕi Φ+ ρ(xi ) = 0. 
     Corollary 2.10.3. The relation
                                       ϕi ϕj ϕi (B) = ϕi ϕk ϕi (B)                        (2.42)
takes place for every subspace B ⊆ X03 , where X03 is the representation space of (Φ+  3
                                                                                    i ) ρ.
                           2.11. LIST OF THE ADMISSIBLE SEQUENCES                                     45

                          2.11. List of the admissible sequences
    Recall that the admissible sequences are introduced in §1.7. Let us construct new admis-
sible sequences acting by the elementary map ϕi .
    Let the action of ϕi on an admissible sequence α be defined so that
     (1) The index i is added in front of the sequence α = i1 i2 . . . in , i.e.,
                                    ϕi (i1 i2 . . . in ) = ii1 i2 . . . in .                      (2.43)
    (2) New sequence ϕi (α) should also be an admissible sequence, in other words, i 6= i1 .
   The rule i 6= i1 in the definition of admissible sequence is motivated by the property
ϕi = −(ϕj + ϕk ), so that ϕi can be always replaced by ϕj + ϕk .
    Proposition 2.11.1. The admissible sequence starting at i1 = 1 may be transformed to
one of the seven types given in Table 2.2, column 1 (similarly for i1 = 2 and i1 = 3, see
(1.23)). Here, n ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . }, m ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }. In case 7, n ≥ 0. In cases 1 and 4,
m > 0.
    For m = 0 cases 1 and 4 are not given in the table: in case 1 (resp. case 4), action ϕ1
transforms (21)n to 1(21)n (resp. (31)n to 1(31)n ).

             Table 2.2.       For D 2,2,2 : the admissible sequences starting at i1 = 1


     Proof. It suffices to prove that every action of ϕi on any admissible sequence from the
list (Table 2.2, column 1) gives us again an admissible sequence from the same list.
     Line 1, action ϕ1 . Applying ϕ1 to the sequence (213)m (21)n we get
                               1(213)m (21)n = 1(213)(213)m−1(21)n .
Since 1213(2...) = 1321(2...), we see that 1(213)m(21)n = 132[1(213)m−1(21)n ]. By the
induction hypothesis
                              1(213)m−1(21)n = 13(213)m−2(21)n+1 ,
so
                 1(213)m (21)n = 132[13(213)m−2(21)n+1 ] = 13(213)m−1 (21)n+1,
i.e., we get a sequence from Line 3. 
     Line 1, action ϕ3 . Applying ϕ3 to the sequence (213)m (21)n we just get a sequence from
Line 2. 
     Line 2, action ϕ1 . Action ϕ1 on the 3(213)m (21)n leads to Line 3. 
46         2. ELEMENTARY MAPS ϕi , ATOMIC, ADMISSIBLE,CUMULATIVE POLYNOMIALS

     Line 2, action ϕ2 . Applying ϕ2 to the sequence 3(213)m(21)n , we get
                             23(213)m (21)n = 23(213)(213)m−1(21)n .
Since 23213... = 21323..., we have 23(213)m(21)n = 213[23(213)m−1(21)n ]. Again, by the
induction hypothesis
                           23(213)m−1(21)n = (213)m−1 (21)n+1 ,
so
                     23(213)m (21)n = 213[(213)m−1 (21)n+1] = (213)m(21)n+1 ,
i.e., a sequence from Line 1. 
     Line 3, action ϕ2 . Applying ϕ2 we immediately get Line 1. 
     Line 3, action ϕ3 . Apply ϕ3 to the sequence 13(213)m(21)n . Again,
                313(213)m(21)n = 313(213)(213)m−1(21)n = 321[313(213)m−1(21)n ].
By the induction hypothesis
                 313(213)m(21)n = 321[3(213)m−1(21)n+1] = 3(213)m(21)n+1 . 
   Lines 4, 5, 6. Similarly as for Lines 1, 2, 3. 
   Line 7. Applying ϕ2 and ϕ3 we get Line 1 and Line 4 with m = 0, respectively: (21)n+1
and (31)n+1 . 

                   2.12. The theorem on the admissible element classes
  The lattice polynomials indexed by admissible sequences are also said to be admissible.
We define admissible elements fα , eα , gα0 in Table 2.3. By definition g0 = I.
    Theorem 2.12.1 (On classes of admissible elements). Let α = in in−1 . . . 1 be an admis-
sible sequence and i 6= in . Then iα is admissible and, for zα = fα , eα , gα0 from Table 2.3, the
following relation holds:
                                      ϕi Φ+ ρ(zα ) = ρ(ziα ).                               (2.44)
     For the proof of Theorem 2.12.1, see Appendix B.

               2.13. The inclusion theorem and the cumulative polynomials
    Theorem 2.13.1. For every admissible sequences α, αi, (i = 1, 2, 3) from Table 2.2, the
following inclusion holds1
                                eαi ⊆ gα0 , i = 1, 2, 3.

     For the proof of Theorem 2.13.1, see §C.1.3.
     It is easy to check by the definitions from Table 2.3 that
                                        fα ⊆ eα ,   gα0 ⊆ eα .                                  (2.45)
So, from Theorem 2.13.1 (Inclusion Theorem) and inclusions 2.45 we get
                                          fαi ⊆ eαi ⊆ gα0 .                                     (2.46)


     1Please
           do not confuse polynomials eαi considered here with polynomials eiα considered, for example,
in Theorem 2.12.1.

    Recall the definition of cumulative polynomials from §1.10. Cumulative polynomials of
length n are constructed as sums of all admissible elements of the same length n, where n is
the length of the multi-index:
                                       X
                              xt (n) =    fin ...i2 t , t = 1, 2, 3,
                                       X
                              yt (n) =    ein ...i2 t , t = 1, 2, 3,
                                       X
                              x0 (n) =    gin ...i2 0 .

From (2.46) and Theorem 2.12.1 the next inclusions take place:

   Corollary 2.13.2.

                              xt (n) ⊆ yt (n) ⊆ x0 (n),    t = 1, 2, 3.                             (2.47)

   Thus, cumulative polynomials satisfy the same inclusions as the corresponding generators
in D 2,2,2 .

    Proposition 2.13.3 (On the cumulative polynomials). If zt (n) is one of the cumulative
polynomials xt (n), yt (n)(t = 1, 2, 3) or x0 (n), then
                                X
                                       ϕi Φ+ ρ(zt (n)) = ρ(zt (n + 1)).             (2.48)
                             i = 1, 2, 3

     Proof. By Theorem 2.12.1
                        ϕi Φ+ ρ(zα ) = ρ(ziα ) for every zα = fα , eα , gα0 .
The latter relation is true only under the condition that iα is admissible, i.e., i 6= in for
α = in in−1 . . . i1 . By (2.15) in the sum of (2.48) we can always exclude one of the elementary
maps ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ3 such that i 6= in . 

                              Perfect polynomials in D2,2,2

  3.1. The chains ai (n) ⊆ bi (n) ⊆ ci (n). Perfectness and distributivity of H + (n).
    Recall the definition of the elements ai (n), bi (n), ci (n). The perfect elements (see §A.6)
are constructed in the following way, see Definition 1.27 from §1.12:
  For n = 0 :
       ai (0) = yj + yk ,
       bi (0) = xi + yj + yk ,
                                    X
       c1 (0) = c2 (0) = c3 (0) =       yi .
                                                                                                (3.1)
  For n ≥ 1 :
       ai (n) = xj (n) + xk (n) + yj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1),
       bi (n) = ai (n) + xi (n + 1) = xj (n) + xk (n) + xi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1),
       ci (n) = ai (n) + yi (n + 1) = xj (n) + xk (n) + yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1).

   By definition we have
                                         ai (n) ⊆ bi (n) ⊆ ci (n).                              (3.2)
The perfectness of the elements ai (0), bi (0), ci (0) is proved in Proposition 2.9.3 and Corollary
2.9.4. The perfectness of the elements ai (1), bi (1), ci (1) is proved in §C.2.1-§C.2.3.

    Proposition 3.1.1. 1) For every element vi (n) = ai (n), bi (n), ci (n), the following rela-
tion holds:
                                       X
                          ρ(vi (n)) =      ϕk Φ+ ρ(vi (n − 1)).                            (3.3)
                                               k = 1, 2, 3

   2) The elements ai (n), bi (n), ci (n) are perfect for every n ≥ 1 and i = 1, 2, 3.

   The proof of Proposition 3.1.1 is given in §C.2.4.
   Let us consider sublattice H + (0) generated by 3 chains

                                 si = {ai (n) ⊆ bi (n)},       i = 1, 2, 3                      (3.4)

and sublattice H + (n) (n ≥ 1) generated by 3 chains

                            si = {ai (n) ⊆ bi (n) ⊆ ci (n)},         i = 1, 2, 3.               (3.5)

   According to definition of perfect elements (see §A.6), H + (n) forms a sublattice of perfect
elements in D 2,2,2 .

   Proposition 3.1.2. H + (n) is a distributive sublattice for every n ≥ 0.

   A proof of Proposition 3.1.2 is given in §C.2.5.

               3.2. The multiplicative form and the cardinality of H + (n)
    Proposition 3.2.1. Every element of the lattice H + (n), where n ≥ 0, is of the form
v1 v2 v3 , where vi ∈ {ai (n), bi (n), ci (n), In }.
     Proof. Let v1 v2 v3 and v1′ v2′ v3′ be two elements of H + (n). Then
                                                                           3
                                                                           \
                                           v1 v2 v3 +    v1′ v2′ v3′   =         sup(vi , vi′ ).                                 (3.6)
                                                                           i=1

Indeed, if vi ⊇ vi′ for every i = 1, 2, 3, then v1 v2 v3 + v1′ v2′ v3′ = v1 v2 v3 . If v1 ⊇ v1′ and v2 ⊆ v2′ ,
v3 ⊆ v3′ , then by (C.13) we have
                            v1 v2 v3 + v1′ v2′ v3′ = v1 v2′ v3′ (v2 v3 + v1′ ) = v1 v2′ v3′ . 

     Corollary 3.2.2. 1) The lattice H + (0) contains ≤ 27 elements.
     2) The lattice H + (n) for n > 0 contains ≤ 64 elements.

     Proposition 3.2.3. The lattice H + (0) contains 27 distinct elements.
     Proposition 3.2.4. The lattice H + (1) contains 64 distinct elements.
     For proof of Propositions 3.2.3 and 3.2.4, see §C.2.6.
     Proposition 3.2.4 is true for arbitrary n:
  Proposition 3.2.5. The lattice H + (n) for n ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . } contains 64 distinct ele-
ments.
   Proof. Let H + (n) contain 64 distinct elements. We will prove that H + (n+1) also contains
64 distinct elements. Let v1 (n)v2 (n)v3 (n) and v1′ (n)v2′ (n)v3′ (n) be two distinct elements in
the H + (n) and ρ is the preprojective representation separating them. For n = 1, the
representation ρ is given by Tables C.6, C.7. For example,
                                               ρ(v1 (n)v2 (n)v3 (n)) = 0,
                                                                                                                                 (3.7)
                                               ρ(v1′ (n)v2′ (n)v3′ (n)) = X01 .
Therefore,
                                   there exists an i such that ρ(vi (n)) = 0,                                                    (3.8)
and
                                               ρ(vi′ (n)) = X01 for every i.                                                     (3.9)
   For every preprojective representation ρ, there exists preprojective representation ρ̃ such
that Φ+ ρ̃ = ρ. (Naturally, ρ̃ = Φ− ρ, see §A.7, [BGP73]). Then, by (3.3) for i from (3.8)
we have                         X                        X
               ρ̃(vi (n + 1)) =       ϕp Φ+ ρ̃(vi (n)) =      ϕp ρ(vi (n)) = 0,         (3.10)
                                           p = 1, 2, 3                                p = 1, 2, 3

i.e.,
                                      ρ̃(v1 (n + 1)v2 (n + 1)v3 (n + 1)) = 0.                                                   (3.11)
On the other hand,
                              X                                          X                               X
        ρ̃(vi′ (n + 1)) =                 ϕp Φ+ ρ̃(vi′ (n)) =                        ϕp ρ(vi′ (n)) =                 ϕp X01 .   (3.12)
                            p = 1, 2, 3                                p = 1, 2, 3                     p = 1, 2, 3

By Corollary 2.4.4 we have
                  X                                   X
                       ϕp X01 =                                 ϕp Φ+ ρ̃(I) =
                    p = 1, 2, 3                 p = 1, 2, 3
                                                                                                     \                            (3.13)
                   ρ̃(y1 (y2 + y3 ) + y2 (y1 + y3 ) + y3 (y1 + y2 )) = ρ̃(                                  (yi + yj )).
                                                                                                     i6=j

Since yi + yj is perfect and ρ̃ = Φ− ρ is non-projective, by Proposition 2.9.3 we have
                                        ρ̃(yi + yj ) = X0 for every {i, j}, i 6= j.                                               (3.14)
Thus, by (3.12), (3.13) and 3.14
                                             ρ̃(vi′ (n + 1)) = X0 for every i,                                                    (3.15)
and therefore
                                 ρ̃(v1′ (n + 1)v2′ (n + 1)v3′ (n + 1)) = X0 .           (3.16)
Thus, by (3.11) and (3.16) the representation ρ̃ separates v1 (n + 1)v2 (n + 1)v3 (n + 1) and
v1′ (n + 1)v2′ (n + 1)v3′ (n + 1). 

    2) As in 1), if Φ+ ρ(v) = 0, then

and (3.18) is true.
   If ρ is projective, then Φ+ ρ = 0 and (3.18) is true as well.
   Consider the case Φ+ ρ 6= 0, i.e., ρ is not a projective representation. If Φ+ ρ(v) = X01 ,
then Φ+ ρ(vu) = Φ+ ρ(u)X01 = Φ+ ρ(u) and

So, (3.18) is true. 
    All considerations given below up to the end of §3.3 are represented modulo linear equiv-
alence, see §A.6.
      Proposition 3.4.2. The next relation takes place modulo linear equivalence
                                         \
                          x0 (n + 2) =        ai (n)      mod θ.                                                                 (3.24)

      Proof. We will prove (3.24) for n = 0, 1 without restriction mod θ.
      Case n = 0. By Table 2.3 , Line 7, k = 0, we have
                                               X                  \

The sum is taken over all permutations {r, s, t} of {1, 2, 3}. On the other hand, by Table
C.5                             \              \
                                     ai (0) = (yr + ys ).                            (3.26)
                                                 i = 1, 2, 3                r6=s
      Case n = 1. We have
                                 x0 (3) = g210 + g120 + g310 + g130 + g230 + g320 .                                              (3.27)
By Table 2.3 , Line 9, k = 0, p = 0, q = 0, we have, for example,
                             g210 = y2 a13       13
                                        1 (x2 + A1 ) = y2 (x1 + y3 )(x2 + x3 + y1 ).

From here,
                   g210 + g310 = y2 (x1 + y3 )(x2 + x3 + y1 ) + y3 (x1 + y2 )(x2 + x3 + y1 ) =
                   (x1 + y3 )(x1 + y2 )[y2 (x2 + x3 + y1 ) + y3 (x2 + x3 + y1 )] =
                   (x1 + y3 )(x1 + y2 )[x2 + y2 (x3 + y1 ) + x3 + y3 (x2 + y1 )] =
                   (x1 + y3 )(x1 + y2 )[(x3 + y2 )(x3 + y1 ) + (x2 + y3 )(x2 + y1 )].

Thus,
        g210 + g310 = (x1 + y3 )(x1 + y2 )[(x3 + y2 )(x3 + y1 ) + (x2 + y3 )(x2 + y1 )],
        g120 + g320 = (x2 + y3 )(x2 + y1 )[(x3 + y1 )(x3 + y2 ) + (x1 + y3 )(x1 + y2 )],                          (3.28)
        g130 + g230 = (x3 + y2 )(x3 + y1 )[(x2 + y1 )(x2 + y3 ) + (x1 + y2 )(x1 + y3 )].
On the other hand, by (C.16) we have
                      t1 (1) = x1 (1) + y1 (2) = x1 + e21 + e31 =
                      x1 + y2 (x1 + y3 ) + y3 (x1 + y2 ) = (x1 + y2 )(x1 + y3 ),
i.e.,
                                   g210 + g310 = t1 (1)(t2 (1) + t3 (1)),
                                   g120 + g320 = t2 (1)(t1 (1) + t3 (1)),                                         (3.29)
                                   g130 + g230 = t3 (1)(t1 (1) + t2 (1)),
and therefore                            \                                   \

which is to be proved. 
    Corollary 3.4.3. For n ≥ 2, the elements x0 (n) are perfect.
    Proof. It follows from the fact that the intersection of perfect elements is also perfect. 

    Conjecture 3.4.4. Relation (3.24) takes place without restriction mod θ.
   For n = 0, this conjecture was proven above in (3.25), (3.26) and, for n = 1, it was
proven in (3.30).

                               qi (n) = x0 (n + 2) + yi (n + 1),                                                  (3.34)

Compare two generator systems on Fig. 1.5. The generators ai (n) ⊆ bi (n) ⊆ ci (n) are given

    In Table 3.2, the elements IUn and OUn are, respectively, the maximal and minimal
elements of Un . The distributivity of Un follows from the distributivity of H + (n), Proposition
3.1.2. It is easy to see that Un is an 8-element Boolean lattice, where

The generators ai (1), bi (1) are perfect, i.e.,

By Table A.1 we have ρx0 (yj ) = 0. Further,

where {i, j, k} is a permutation of {1, 2, 3}.
   According to the definition of perfect elements from §A.6

                       pj (n) + pk (n) = x0 (n + 2) + xj (n + 1) + xk (n + 1).
   1) Then the inclusion (3.42) follows from
                                 X
                                      yt (n + 2) ⊆ x0 (n + 2),                                               (3.45)
                                   t = 1, 2, 3

which, in turn, comes from the Corollary 2.13.2 concerning cumulative polynomials.
   2) Inclusion (3.43) follows from the relation
                                          xj (n + 1) ⊆ ci (n + 1).
   3) The last inclusion (3.44) is a little more difficult. It is equivalent to
                                                              X
                (pj (n) + pk (n))(xi (n + 1) + xk (n + 1) +         yt (n + 2)) ⊆
                                                                          t = 1, 2, 3
                                                        X                                                    (3.46)
                 xj (n + 1) + xk (n + 1) +                       yt (n + 2).
                                                   t = 1, 2, 3
58                                3. PERFECT POLYNOMIALS IN D2,2,2

From (3.45) and since xk (n + 1) ⊆ pj (n), we see that (3.46) is equivalent to
                               X
                xk (n + 1) +        yt (n + 2) + (pj (n) + pk (n))xi (n + 1) ⊆
                                   t = 1, 2, 3
                                                        X                                         (3.47)
                     xj (n + 1) + xk (n + 1) +                      yt (n + 2).
                                                      t = 1, 2, 3

To prove (3.47), it suffices to check that
                                  (pj (n) + pk (n))xi (n + 1) ⊆ yi (n + 2),                       (3.48)
i.e.,
                              ai (n)bj (n)bk (n)xi (n + 1) ⊆ yi (n + 2).                          (3.49)
Since xi (n + 1) ⊆ bj (n)bk (n) (by relation A.13), we see that (3.49) is equivalent to
                                        ai (n)xi (n + 1) ⊆ yi (n + 2).                            (3.50)
We will prove (3.49) modulo linear equivalence
                                  ai (n)xi (n + 1) ⊆ yi (n + 2) mod θ.                            (3.51)
     Conjecture 3.9.2. Relation (3.51) takes place without restriction mod θ.

     So, let us prove (3.51). Let n = 1, i = 1. We have to prove that
                                                 a1 (1)x1 (2) ⊆ y1 (3).                           (3.52)
According to (1.27) or (C.19), (C.20) we have
             a1 (1) =x2 + x3 + y3 (x2 + y1 ) + y1 (x2 + y3 ) + y1 (x3 + y2 ) + y2 (x3 + y1 ) =
                     (x2 + y3 )(x2 + y1 ) + (x3 + y2 )(x3 + y1 ).
Further, according to §1.11, we have
                                          x1 (2) = f21 + f31 = y2 y3
and
        y1 (3) =y3 (y1 + x2 )(y2 + x3 ) + y1 (x2 + y3 )(x3 + y2 ) + y2 (y1 + x3 )(y3 + x2 ) =
                (x2 + y3 )(x3 + y2 )[y3 (y1 + x2 )(y2 + x3 ) + y1 + y2 (y1 + x3 )(y3 + x2 )] =
                (x2 + y3 )(x3 + y2 )[(y1 + x2 )(x3 + y2 y3 ) + y1 + (y1 + x3 )(x2 + y2 y3 )] =
                (x2 + y3 )(x3 + y2 )[(y1 + x2 )(x3 + y1 + y2 y3 ) + (y1 + x3 )(x2 + y1 + y2 y3 )] =
                (x2 + y3 )(x3 + y2 )(x3 + y1 + y2 y3 )(x2 + y1 + y2 y3 )(y1 + x2 + x3 ).
Now, (3.52) is true since
                 x1 (2) = y2 y3 ⊆ (x2 + y3 )(x3 + y2 )(x3 + y1 + y2 y3 )(x2 + y1 + y2 y3 )
and
               a1 (1) = (x2 + y3 )(x2 + y1 ) + (x3 + y2 )(x3 + y1 ) ⊆ y1 + x2 + x3 .
Therefore, (3.52) is also true mod θ, i.e., (3.51) is true for n = 1.
   Induction step. Let (3.51) be true for n, i.e.,
                          Φ+ ρ(ai (n)xi (n + 1)) ⊆ Φ+ ρ(yi (n + 2))                               (3.53)
                                                       P
for every indecomposable representation ρ. Applying       ϕi we have
                 X                                  X
                       ϕp Φ+ ρ(ai (n)xi (n + 1)) ⊆         ϕp Φ+ ρ(yi (n + 2)).                   (3.54)
                    p = 1, 2, 3                                      p = 1, 2, 3
                3.10. THE THEOREM ON PERFECT ELEMENTS. CONSIDERATIONS mod θ                             59

Since ai (n) is perfect, we have according to (3.18) and Proposition 3.4.1
        X                      X                          X

      p = 1, 2, 3             p = 1, 2, 3                              p = 1, 2, 3

By Propositions 2.13.3 and 3.1.1
                              ρ(ai (n + 1)xi (n + 2)) ⊆ ρ(yi (n + 3)).                              (3.56)
So, the induction step and Proposition 3.9.1 are proven. 
   Corollary 3.9.3 (Connection edges). The following 8 inclusions hold:
                            ci (n + 1) ⊆ ai (n)bj (n)bk (n),                i = 1, 2, 3,            (3.57)

                      ci (n + 1)cj (n + 1) ⊆ ai (n)aj (n)bk (n),                     k = 1, 2, 3,   (3.58)
                                       \                         \
                                              ci (n + 1) ⊆             ai (n),                      (3.59)
                                    i=1,2,3                  i=1,2,3
                                      X                           \
                                                  ci (n + 1) ⊆             bi (n).                  (3.60)
                                    i = 1, 2, 3                  i=1,2,3

The 8 inclusions (3.57) – (3.60) correspond to the 8 edges shown on Fig. 1.7 or Fig. A.3.
   Proof. Inclusions (3.57) follow from (3.42), inclusions (3.58), (3.59) and (3.60) follows
from (3.57), see Table 3.1. 

            3.10. The theorem on perfect elements. Considerations mod θ
   We will prove the theorem describing connection construction of sublattices H + (n).
   Proposition 3.10.1. 1) For every u ∈ Un and every v ∈ H + (n + 1), we have u + v ∈ Un .
   2) For every u ∈ H + (n) and every v ∈ Vn+1 , we have uv ∈ Vn+1 .
   Proof. 1) According to Table 3.2, the elements of Un are
                                               X
                   pi (n),  pi (n) + pj (n),       pi (n),  x0 (n + 2).                             (3.61)
It is sufficient to verify heading 1) for the generators pi (n+1), qi (n+1), si (n+1) of H + (n+1).
According to definition (3.34) it is sufficient to verify that adding the elements
                                x0 (n + 3),          xi (n + 2),      yi (n + 2)
does not lead out of the elements of type (3.61). According to (2.45) and Corollary (2.13.2)
we have
                             x0 (n + 3) ⊆ yi (n + 2) ⊆ x0 (n + 2)                     (3.62)
and adding the element x0 (n + 3) does not lead out of Un . From (3.62) it follows that
                     pi (n) = x0 (n + 2) + xi (n + 1) ⊇ yi (n + 2) ⊇ xi (n + 2).                    (3.63)
Therefore adding yi (n + 2) and xi (n + 2) does not lead out of Un . Finally,
                     pi (n) ⊇ xi (n + 1),          pj (n) + xi (n + 1) = pi (n) + pj (n),           (3.64)
i.e., addition xi (n + 1) does not go lead of the Un either. 
     2) Every u ∈ H + (n) is of the form u1 u2u3 , where (Fig. 1.5)
                                 ui ∈ {ai (n) ⊆ bi (n) ⊆ ci (n) ⊆ I}.
60                                3. PERFECT POLYNOMIALS IN D2,2,2
                                       T         P
If ui 6= ai (n) for every i, then u ⊇ bi (n) ⊇     ci (n + 1) ⊇ v and uv = v. So, it is sufficient
                                    +
to consider the elements u ∈ H (n) of the type ai (n)u′ , ai (n)aj (n)u′ and ai (n)aj (n)ak (n),
where u′ ⊇ v, i.e., it is sufficient to prove that
                                     vai (n) ∈ Vn+1 for every v ⊆ Vn+1 .                                     (3.65)
By Corollary 3.9.3 we have ci (n + 1) ⊆ ai (n) and
                                           ci (n + 1)ai (n) = ci (n + 1),                                    (3.66)
and so (3.65) is proven for v = ci (n + 1).
   Now we consider the case i 6= j, for example, a2 (n)c1 (n + 1). Further, we have
                                                           X
                    c1 (n + 1) = x3 (n + 1) + x2 (n + 1) +      yi (n + 2),
                                                                                   i = 1, 2, 3

                    x3 (n + 1) ⊆ a2 (n),                                                                     (3.67)
                      X                                                        \
                            yi (n + 2) ⊆ x0 (n + 2) =                                     ai (n) ⊆ a2 (n).
                    i = 1, 2, 3                                             i = 1, 2, 3

The last relation follows from the (3.24) and it is true mod θ. Therefore
                                              X
              c1 (n + 1)a2 (n) = x3 (n + 1) +        yi (n + 2) + x2 (n + 1)a2 (n).                          (3.68)
                                                              i = 1, 2, 3

According to (3.51) we have x2 (n + 1)a2 (n) ⊆ c2 (n + 1) and
                                           X
          c1 (n + 1)a2 (n) ⊆ x3 (n + 1) +       yi (n + 2) + x2 (n + 1)c2 (n + 1) =
                                                          i = 1, 2, 3
                                              X
           c2 (n + 1)[x3 (n + 1) +                        yi (n + 2) + x2 (n + 1)] =
                                            i = 1, 2, 3

           c2 (n + 1)c1 (n + 1) ⊆ a2 (n)c1 (n + 1).
Thus,
                                   c1 (n + 1)a2 (n) = c1 (n + 1)c2 (n + 1)                                   (3.69)
and (3.65) is proven for v = cj (n + 1), i 6= j. Finally, by (3.66), (3.69) we have
                        X
                 aj (n)      ci (n + 1) = aj (n)[ci (n + 1) + cj (n + 1)] =
                       i = 1, 2, 3

                 cj (n + 1) + ci (n + 1)aj (n) = cj (n + 1) + ci (n + 1)cj (n + 1),
i.e.,
                                             X
                                  aj (n)                 ci (n + 1) = cj (n + 1).                           (3.70)

     Theorem 3.10.2. The union                   H + (n) is a distributive lattice mod θ. The diagram H +
                                            n=0
is obtained by uniting the diagrams of H + (n) for n ≥ 0 and joining the cubes Un and Vn+1
for all n ≥ 0, i.e., it is necessary to draw 8 additional edges for all n ≥ 0. (Fig. 1.7).
    Proof. We have to show that the sum and the intersection do not lead out of H + . The
distributivity follows from the absence of diamonds M3 , see Proposition A.4.2, [Bir48]. If
                                            u ∈ H + (n),            v ∈ H + (m)

and these lattices are not adjacent, i.e., n ≤ m − 2, then v ⊆ u. Indeed, by Proposition 3.9.1
(Fig. 1.7) we have
           X                \                    \                   \

         i = 1, 2, 3     i = 1, 2, 3           i = 1, 2, 3             i = 1, 2, 3

So, we consider only the case u ∈ H + (n), v ∈ H + (n + 1). Every element u ∈ H + (n) is of
the form u1 + u2 , where u1 ∈ H + (n) and u2 ∈ Un . By Proposition 3.10.1 we have
                       u + v = u1 + u2 + v = u1 + (u2 + v) ∈ H + (n).                  (3.71)
Similarly, every element v from H + (n + 1) is of the form v1 v2 , where v1 ∈ H + (n + 1) and
v2 ∈ Vn+1 . By Proposition 3.10.1
                             vu = v1 v2 u = v1 (v2 u) ∈ H + (n + 1).                   (3.72)
So, Theorem 3.10.2 follows from (3.71) and (3.72). This concludes the proof. 

                    Atomic and admissible polynomials in D4

                                4.1. Admissible sequences in D 4
    For definition of admissible sequences in the case of the modular lattice D 4 , see §1.7.2.
 Essentially, the fundamental property of this definition is
                             ijk = ilk      for all {i, j, k, l} = {1, 2, 3, 4}                   (4.1)
 Relation (4.1) is our main tool in all further calculations of admissible sequences of D 4 .
    Without loss of generality only sequences starting at 1 can be considered. The following
 proposition will be used for the classification of admissible sequences in D 4 .
     Proposition 4.1.1. The following relations hold
1) (31)r (32)s (31)t = (32)s (31)r+t ,
2) (31)r (21)s (31)t = (31)r+t (21)s ,
3) (42)r (41)s = (41)r (31)s ,     s ≥ 1,
4) 2(41)r (31)s = 2(31)s+1(41)r−1,        r ≥ 1,
       r     s     t       r     s      t
5) (43) (42) (41) = (41) (21) (31) ,
6) 1(41)r (21)s = 1(21)s (41)r ,      1(i1)r (j1)s = 1(j1)s (i1)r ,   i, j ∈ {2, 3, 4}, i 6= j,
       r     t     s       r     s     t
7) (41) (21) (31) = (41) (31) (21) ,
8) (13)s (21)r = (12)r (31)s ,
9) 12(41)r (31)s (21)t = (14)r (31)s+1(21)t = (14)r (21)t+1 (31)s ,
10) 12(14)r (31)s (21)t = (14)r (31)s (21)t+1 ,
11) 13(14)r (31)s (21)t = (14)r (31)s+2(21)t−1 ,
12) 32(14)r (31)s (21)t = (31)s (21)t+1 (41)r = 34(14)r (31)s (21)t ,
13) 42(14)r (31)s (21)t = (41)s (21)t+1 (31)r = 43(14)r (31)s (21)t ,
14) 23(14)r (31)s (21)t = (21)t+1 (31)s (41)r = 24(14)r (31)s (21)t .
     Proof. 1) For r = 1, we have
     (31)(32)s (31)t = 31(32)(32)...(32)(32)(31)t = 31(41)(32)...(32)(32)(31)t =
     31(41)(41)...(41)(41)(31)t = 32(41)(41)...(41)(41)(31)t = 32(32)(41)...(41)(41)(31)t =
     32(32)(32)...(32)(31)(31)t = (32)s (31)t+1 .
 Applying induction on r we get the relation
                                 (31)r (32)s (31)t = (32)s (31)r+t . 

     2) For t = 1, we have
    (31)r (21)s (31) = (31)r (21)(21)...(21)(21)31 = (31)r (21)(21)...(21)(34)31 =
    (31)r (21)(21)...(34)(34)31 = (31)r (34)(34)...(34)(34)21 = (31)r (34)(34)...(34)(21)21 =
    (31)r (34)(34)...(21)(21)21 = (31)r (31)(21)...(21)(21)21 = (31)r+1(21)s .
 Applying induction on t we get the relation
                                 (31)r (21)s (31)t = (31)r+t (21)s . 

64                      4. ATOMIC AND ADMISSIBLE POLYNOMIALS IN D4

     3) For s = 1, we have
                   (42)r 41 = 42(42)(42)...(42)(42)41 = 42(42)(42)...(42)(42)31 =
                   42(42)(42)...(42)(31)31 = 42(31)(31)...(31)(31)31 =
                   41(31)(31)...(31)(31)31 = 41(31)r .
Thus, by heading 2) we have
                            (42)r (41)s = 41(31)r (41)s−1 = (41)s (31)r . 

     4) For s = 0, we have
                                  2(41)r = 2(41)(41)r−1 = 2(31)(41)r−1
and by heading 2):
                       2(41)r (31)s = 2(31)(41)r−1(31)s = 2(31)s+1(41)r−1 . 

     5) Applying heading 3) we get
                                    (43)r (42)s (41)t = (43)r (41)s (31)t .
Again, applying heading 3) to (43)r (41)s we get
                                          (43)r (41)s = (41)r (21)s
and
                                  (43)r (42)s (41)t = (41)r (21)s (31)t . 

     6) For s = 1, we have
                 1(41)r (21) = 1(41)(41)...(41)(41)(21) = 1(41)(41)...(41)(23)(21) =
                 1(41)(41)...(23)(23)(21) = 1(23)(23)...(23)(23)(21) =
                 1(23)(23)...(23)(23)(41) = 1(23)(23)...(23)(41)(41) =
                 1(23)(41)...(41)(41)(41) = 1(21)(41)...(41)(41)(41) =
                 1(21)(41)r .
Thus, by heading 2) we have
                         1(41)r (21)s = 1(21)(41)r (21)s−1 = 1(21)s (41)r . 

     7) Follows from 6). 
     8) First,
                                1321 = 1421 = 1431 = 1231 = 1241 = 1341                (4.2)
     For r = 1, by (4.2) we have
                 13(21)s = 13(21)(21)...(21)(21) = 12(31)(21)(21)...(21)(21)(21) =
                 12(34)(21)(21)...(21)(21)(21) = 12(34)(34)(21)...(21)(21)(21) =
                 12(34)(34)(34)...(34)(34)(31) = 12(12)(12)(12)...(12)(34)(31) =
                 12(12)(12)(12)...(12)(12)(31) = (12)s (31).
Suppose
                                         (13)r (21)s = (12)s (31)r ,
                                4.1. ADMISSIBLE SEQUENCES IN D4                               65

then we have
           (13)r+1(21)s = 13(12)s(31)r = 13(12)(12)...(12)(12)(31)r =
           13(43)(43)...(43)(12)(31)r = 13(43)(43)...(43)(41)(31)r =
           12(43)(43)...(43)(41)(31)r = 12(12)(43)...(43)(41)(31)r =
           12(12)(12)...(12)(41)(31)r = 12(12)(12)...(12)(31)(31)r = (12)s (31)r+1 .
   Thus, by induction the following relation holds:
                                     (13)r (21)s = (12)s (31)r     

   9) First of all,
             12(41)r (31)s (21)t = 12(41)(41)...(41)(41)(31)s(21)t =
             12(32)(41)...(41)(41)(31)s(21)t = 12(32)(32)...(32)(31)(31)s(21)t =
             14(14)(32)...(32)(31)(31)s(21)t = 14(14)(14)...(14)(31)(31)s(21)t =
             (14)r (31)s+1(21)t .
By heading 4) we have
                                    4(31)s+1(21)t = 4(21)t+1 (31)s .
Thus,
                           (14)r (31)s+1 (21)t = (14)r (21)t+1 (31)s . 

   10) First, we have
                                      12(14)r (31) = (14)r (21)2                           (4.3)
since
           12(14)r (31) = 12(14)(14)...(14)(14)(31) = 12(32)(14)...(14)(14)(31) =
           12(32)(32)...(32)(34)(31) = 14(14)(32)...(32)(34)(31) =
           14(14)(14)...(14)(34)(21) = 14(14)(14)...(14)(21)(21) = (14)r (21)2 .
By (4.3) we have
            12(14)r (31)s (21)t = 12(14)r (31)(31)s−1(21)t = (14)r (21)2 (31)s−1 (21)t .
By headings 2) and 4):
                               (21)2 (31)s−1(21)t = (21)t+2 (31)s−1
and
               12(14)r (31)s (21)t = (14)r (21)t+2 (31)s−1 = (14)r (31)s (21)t+1 . 

   11) Applying permutation 2 ↔ 3 to heading 10), we get
                             13(14)r (21)t (31)s = (14)r (21)t (31)s+1 .
By heading 4)
                         13(14)r (21)t (31)s = (14)r (31)s+2(21)t−1 . 

   12) By heading 8)
                                       (14)r (31)s = (13)s (41)r

and
              32(14)r (31)s (21)t = 32(13)s (41)r (21)t =
              32(13)(13)...(13)(13)(41)r (21)t = 34(24)(13)...(13)(13)(41)r (21)t =
              34(24)(24)...(24)(21)(41)r (21)t = 31(24)(24)...(24)(21)(41)r (21)t =
              31(31)(31)...(31)(21)(41)r (21)t = (31)s (21)(41)r (21)t .
By heading 2) we have
                             (31)s (21)(41)r (21)t = (31)s (21)t+1 (41)r
and
                            32(14)r (31)s (21)t = (31)s (21)t+1 (41)r     
     13) By heading 8):
                                       (14)r (31)s = (13)s (41)r
and
                        42(14)r (31)s (21)t = 42(13)s (41)r (21)t .
Applying permutation 4 ↔ 3 to heading 12) we get
                            42(13)r (41)s (21)t = (41)s (21)t+1 (31)r . 

     14) By heading 4) we have
                            23(14)r (31)s (21)t = 23(14)r (21)t+1 (31)s−1 .
Applying permutation 2 ↔ 3 to heading 12) we get
                          23(14)r (21)t+1 (31)s−1 = (21)t+1 (31)s (41)r . 

     Proposition 4.1.2. Full list of admissible sequences starting at 1 is given by Table 4.1.
    Note to Table 4.1. Type F ij (resp. Gij, Hij) denotes the admissible sequence starting
at j and ending at i. Sequences of type F ij and H11 contain an even number of symbols,
sequences of type Gij and Hij, (i > 1) contain an odd number of symbols. For differences
in types F ij, Gij, Hij, see the table.
    Proof. It suffices to prove that maps ϕi , where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, do not lead out of Table 4.1.
The exponents r, s, t may be any non-negative integer number. The proof is based on the
relations from Proposition 4.1.1. We refer only to number of relation and drop reference to
Proposition 4.1.1 itself.
    Lines F 21–F 41. Consider, for example, ϕ3 . By heading 4) we get
                           ϕ3 ((21)t (41)r (31)s ) = 3(41)r+1 (21)t−1 (31)s ,               (4.4)
i.e., we get G31. 
     Line G11. Consider the action ϕ2 . By heading 6) we get
                ϕ2 (1(41)r (31)s (21)t ) = 2(1(41)r (21)t (31)s ) = 21(41)r (21)t (31)s .
By heading 2) we have
                 ϕ2 (1(41)r (31)s (21)t ) = 21(41)r (21)t (31)s = (21)t+1 (41)r (31)s ,     (4.5)
i.e., we get F 21. 
     Line G21. By heading 9) applying ϕ1 we get H11. For the action ϕ3 , we have
                  32(41)r (31)s (21)t = 31(41)r (31)s (21)t = (31)s+1(41)r (21)t ,          (4.6)

         23(41)r (31)s (21)t = 23(41)r (21)t (31)s = 21(41)r (21)t (31)s = (21)t+1 (41)r (31)s

So, by heading 2) we have

                              43(41)r (31)s (21)t = (41)r (21)t+1 (31)s ,

i.e., we get F 21. For the action ϕ3 we have from 2)

                    34(21)t (31)s (41)r = 31(21)t(31)s (41)r = (31)s+1 (21)t (41)r

     Thus, all cases are considerd and the proposition is proved. 
    The pyramid on the Fig. 1.4 has internal points. We consider the slice S(n) containing
all sequences of the same length n. The slices S(3) and S(4) are shown on the Fig. 4.1. The
slice S(4) contains only one internal point

                      14(21) = 13(21) = 13(41) = 12(41) = 14(31) = 12(31)                         (4.9)

The slices S(4) and S(5) are shown on the Fig. 4.2. The slice S(5) contains 3 internal points

     4.2. Atomic polynomials and elementary maps in the modular lattice D 4
     The free modular lattice D 4 is generated by 4 generators:
                                         D 4 = {e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 }.
    Recall, that atomic lattice polynomials aijn , where i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, n ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . },
                  4
for the case of D , are defined as follows
                          (
                             aij
                              n = I                            for n = 0,
                    aij
                      n =
                             aij           kl             lk
                              n = ei + ej an−1 = ei + ej an−1 for n ≥ 1,

where {i, j, k, l} is the permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4}, see §1.5.
     Proposition 4.2.1. 1) The following property of the atomic elements take place
                       ej akl      lk
                           n = ej an for n ≥ 1, and distinct indices j, k, l.                   (4.11)
     2) The definition of the atomic elements aij
                                               n in (1.17) is well-defined.

     3) We have
                             ij             ij   ij   ij
                       aij
                        n ⊆ an−1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ a2 ⊆ a1 ⊆ a0 = I for all i 6= j.                     (4.12)
   4) To equalize the lower indices of the admissible polynomials fα0 (see Table 4.3 and
Theorem 4.8.1) we will use the following relation:
                ej + ei ajk   lk             ij il
                         t+1 as−1 = ej + ek at as       for all {i, j, k, l} = {1, 2, 3, 4}.    (4.13)
     Proof. 1) Suppose (4.11) is true for the index n − 1:
                                           ej akl        lk
                                               n−1 = ej an−1 .

Since ej ⊆ aji
            n−1 , by the permutation property (A.4), we have
                              ij                   ji                   ji
         ej akl                                                                     lk
             n = ej (ek + el an−1 ) = ej (ek + el an−1 ) = ej (el + ek an−1 ) = ej an .        (4.14)

     2) follows from 1). 
     3) By induction hypothesis we have akl     kl
                                         n−1 ⊆ an−2 , and therefore
                                                               ij
                           aij           kl             kl
                            n = ei + ej an−1 ⊆ ei + ej an−2 = an−1 . 

     4) Without loss of generality, we will show that
                                  e2 + e1 a24   34             12 13
                                           t+1 as−1 = e2 + e4 at as .                           (4.15)
By permutation property (A.4) we have
                       e2 + e1 a24   34                      13 43
                                t+1 as−1 = e2 + e1 (e4 + e2 at )as−1 =

                       e2 + e1 (e4 + e2 a13 43                        13 43
                                         t as−1 ) = e2 + e4 (e1 + e2 at as−1 ) =

                       e2 + e4 a13          43               13 12
                                t (e1 + e2 as−1 ) = e2 + e4 at as . 

    Now we briefly recall definitions due to Gelfand and Ponomarev [GP74], [GP76],
[GP77] of spaces Gi , Gi ′ , representations ν 0 , ν 1 , joint maps ψi , and elementary maps ϕi ,
where i = 1, 2, 3, 4. To compare these definitions with a case of the modular lattice D 2,2,2 ,
see Ch.2.
     We denote by
                               {Y1 , Y2 , Y3, Y4 | Yi ⊆ X0 , i = 1, 2, 3, 4}

                                                                   1

                                      ∪p                              ∪p                                       (4.16)
                                                                  +
                              ρ       Y4                         Φ ρ  Y41



    The space X01 — the space of the representation Φ+ ρ — is
                                                               X
                       X01 = {(η1 , η2 , η3 , η4 ) | ηi ∈ Yi ,   ηi = 0},

where i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. As in the case of D 2,2,2 §2.1, we set
                                                 M
                                        R=              Yi ,
                                                        i = 1, 2, 3, 4

i.e.,
                              R = {(η1 , η2 , η3 , η4 ) | ηi ∈ Yi ,          i = 1, 2, 3}.
Then, X01 ⊆ R.
   For the case of D 4 , the spaces Gi and G′ i are introduced as follows:
                  G1 = {(η1 , 0, 0, 0) | η1 ∈ Y1 },            G′1 = {(0, η2 , η3 , η4 ) | ηi ∈ Yi },
                  G2 = {(0, η2 , 0, 0) | η2 ∈ Y2 },            G′2 = {(η1 , 0, η3 , η4 ) | ηi ∈ Yi },
                                                                                                               (4.17)
                  G3 = {(0, 0, η3, 0) | η3 ∈ Y3 },             G′3 = {(η1 , η2 , 0, η4 ) | ηi ∈ Yi },
                  G4 = {(0, 0, 0, η4) | η4 ∈ Y4 },             G′4 = {(η1 , η2 , η3 , 0) | ηi ∈ Yi }.

    For details, see [GP74, p.43]1.
    The associated representations ν0 , ν1 in R are defined by Gelfand and Ponomarev [GP74,
eq.(7.2)]2:
                                       ν 0 (ei ) = X01 + Gi ,            i = 1, 2, 3,
                                         1
                                                                                                               (4.18)
                                       ν (ei ) =   X01 G′i ,      i = 1, 2, 3.

    Following [GP74], we introduce the elementary maps ϕi :
                                    ϕi : X01 −→ X0 , (η1 , η2 , η3 , η4 ) 7−→ ηi .
From the definition we have
                                             ϕ1 + ϕ2 + ϕ3 + ϕ4 = 0.                                            (4.19)

    4.3. Basic relations for the elementary and joint maps in the case of D 4
   We define joint maps ψi : D4 −→ L(R) as in the case of D 2,2,2 :
                                       ψi (a) = X01 + Gi (G′i + ν 1 (a)).                   (4.20)
    Proposition 4.3.1. In the case D 4 the joint maps ψi satisfy the following basic rela-
tions1:
     (1) ψi (ei ) = X01 ,
    (2) ψi (ej ) = ν 0 (ei (ek + el )),
    (3) ψi (I) = ν 0 (ei (ej + ek + el )),
    (4) ψi (ek el ) = ψj (ek el ) = ν 0 (ei ej ).

   Proof. 1) From (4.20) and (4.18) we have ψi (ei ) = X01 + Gi G′i = X01 . 
   2)We have ψi (yj ) = X01 +Gi (G′i +X01 G′j ). From Gi ⊆ G′j for i 6= j and by the permutation
property (A.4), we get
                                ψi (yj ) = X01 + Gi (G′i G′j + X01 ).
Since G′i G′j = Gk + Gl , where i, j, k, l are distinct indices, we have
    ψi (yj ) = X01 + Gi (X01 + Gk + Gl ) = (X01 + Gi )(X01 + Gk + Gl ) = ν 0 (ei (ek + el )). 

   3) Again,
                     ψi (I) = X01 + Gi (G′i + X01 ) =
                                                                                            (4.21)
                     X01 + Gi (Gj + Gk + Gl + X01 ) = ν 0 (ei (ej + ek + el )). 
   4) Since Gi ⊆ G′k for all i 6= k, we have
                                  ψi (ek el ) = X01 + Gi (G′i + X01 G′k G′l ) =
                                                                                            (4.22)
                                  X01 + Gi (G′i G′k G′l + X01 ).
Since Gj (Gi + Gk + Gl ) = 0, then
                                               G′i G′j = Gk + Gl .                          (4.23)
Indeed,
                               G′i G′j = (Gj + Gk + Gl )(Gi + Gk + Gl ) =
                                                                                            (4.24)
                               Gk + Gl + Gj (Gi + Gk + Gl ) = Gk + Gl .
From (4.22) and (4.23), we see that
                                  ψi (ek el ) = X01 + Gi (G′i G′k G′l + X01 ) =
                                  X01 + Gi (X01 + Gj ) = ν0 (ei ej ). 
  The main relation between ϕi and ψi (Proposition 2.4.3) holds also for the case of D 4 .
Namely, let a, b, c ⊆ D 2,2,2 , then

                         (i) If ψi (a) = ν 0 (b), then ϕi Φ+ ρ(a) = ρ(b).
                        (ii) If ψi (a) = ν 0 (b) and ψi (ac) = ψi (a)ψi (c), then           (4.25)
                              ϕi Φ+ ρ(ac) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(a)ϕi Φ+ ρ(c).
   From Proposition 4.3.1 and eq.(4.25) we have

     Corollary 4.3.2. For the elementary map ϕi the following basic relations hold1:
      (1) ϕi Φ+ ρ(ei ) = 0,
      (2) ϕi Φ+ ρ(ej ) = ρ(ei (ek + el )),
      (3) ϕi Φ+ ρ(I) = ρ(ei (ej + ek + el )),
      (4) ϕi Φ+ ρ(ek yl ) = ρ(ei ej ).

      4.4. Additivity and multiplicativity of the joint maps in the case of D 4
    Proposition 4.4.1. The map ψi is additive and quasimultiplicative with respect to the
lattice operations + and ∩, namely2:
      (1) ψi (a) + ψi (b) = ψi (a + b),
      (2) ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi ((a + ei )(b + xj xk xl )),
      (3) ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi (a(b + ei + xj xk xl )).

     Proof. 1) By the modular law (A.3)
     ψi (a) + ψi (b) = X01 + Gi (G′i + ν 1 (a)) + Gi (G′i + ν 1 (b)) =
                                                                                               
     X01 + Gi G′i + ν 1 (a) + Gi (G′i + ν 1 (b)) = X01 + Gi (G′i + ν 1 (b))(G′i + Gi ) + ν 1 (a) .
         ′
Since Gi + Gi = R, it follows that
                                                           
         ψi (a) + ψi (b) = X01 + Gi G′i + ν 1 (b) + ν 1 (a) = X01 + Gi (G′i + ν 1 (b + a)). 

     2) By definition (2.6) ν 1 (b) ⊆ X01 , and by the permutation property (A.5) we have
                            X01 + Gi (G′i + ν 1 (a)) = X01 + G′i (Gi + ν 1 (a)).
By the modular law (A.3) and by (A.5)
                            ψi (a)ψi (b) =
                                                                             
                            X01 + Gi (G′i + ν 1 (a)) X01 + G′i (Gi + ν 1 (b)) =
                                                                             
                            X01 + Gi X01 (G′i + ν 1 (a)) + G′i (Gi + ν 1 (b)) .
Since
                    X01 (G′i + ν 1 (a)) = X01 G′i + ν 1 (a)    and          X01 G′i = ν 1 (ei ),
we see that                                                                     
                ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi ν 1 (ei ) + ν 1 (a) + G′i (Gi + ν 1 (b)) .                 (4.26)
By the permutation property (A.4) and by (2.19) we have
                                                                                 
               ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi G′i + (ν 1 (ei ) + ν 1 (a))(Gi + ν 1 (b)) .                 (4.27)
Since
            Gi = G′j G′k G′l   and      ν 1 (ei ) + ν 1 (a) = ν 1 (ei + a) = X01 (ν 1 (ei + a)),
it follows that
                                                                                 
            ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi G′i + ν 1 (ei + a)(X01 G′j G′k G′l + ν 1 (b)) =
                                                                  

                                                          
            X01 + Gi G′i + ν 1 (ei + a)ν 1 (ej ek el + b) = ψi ((a + ei )(b + ej ek el )). 

              4.5. THE ACTION OF MAPS ψi AND ϕi ON THE ATOMIC ELEMENTS IN D4                     75

   3) From (4.26) and since ν 1 (ei ) = X01 G′i ⊆ G′i , we have
                                                                                    
                    ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi ν 1 (a) + G′i (Gi + ν 1 (b) + ν 1 (ei )) .       (4.28)
Again, by (A.4) we have
                                                                                   
                   ψi (a)ψi (b) = X01 + Gi G′i + ν 1 (a)(Gi + ν 1 (b) + ν 1 (ei )) =
                                                                                
                   X01 + Gi G′i + ν 1 (a)(X01 G′j G′k G′l + ν 1 (b) + ν 1 (ei )) .
Thus, ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi (a(b + xi + xj xk xl )). 
   We need the following corollary (atomic multiplicativity) from Proposition 4.4.1
   Corollary 4.4.2. 1) Suppose one of the following inclusions holds1:
                                       (i)     ei + ej ek el ⊆ a,
                                       (ii)    ei + ej ek el ⊆ b,
                                       (iii)    ei ⊆ a,      ej ek el ⊆ b,
                                       (iv)     ei ⊆ b,     ej ek el ⊆ a.
Then the joint map ψi operates as a homomorphism on the elements a and b with respect to
the lattice operations + and ∩, i.e.,
                      ψi (a) + ψi (b) = ψi (a + b), ψi (a)ψi (b) = ψi (a)ψi (b).
  2) The joint map ψi applied to the following atomic elements is the intersection preserving
map, i.e., multiplicative with respect to the operation ∩:
                                                                       4
                             ψi (baij               ij
                                   n ) = ψi (b)ψi (an ) for every b ⊆ D .                    (4.29)

          4.5. The action of maps ψi and ϕi on the atomic elements in D 4
    Proposition 4.5.1. The joint maps ψi applied to the atomic elements aij
                                                                         n satisfy the
following relations2
                     0
     (1) ψi (aij           kl
              n ) = ν (ei an ),
                     0
     (2) ψj (aij
              n ) = ν (ej (ek + el )),
                        0
     (3) ψj (ei akl           kl
                 n ) = ν (ej an+1 ).


   Proof. 1) Since ψi (ei ) = X01 (Proposition 4.3.1, heading (1)), we have
                 ψi (aij                 kl                         kl              kl
                      n ) = ψi (ei + ej an−1 ) = ψi (ei ) + ψi (ej an−1 ) = ψi (ej an−1 ).

We suppose that heading (3) of Proposition 4.5.1 for n − 1 is true (induction hypothesis),
and we get
                                                     0
                         ψi (aij            kl             kl
                              n ) = ψi (ej an−1 ) = ν (ej an ). 

   2) Here,
                   ψj (aij                 kl                         kl
                        n ) = ψj (ei + ej an−1 ) = ψj (ei ) + ψj (ej an−1 ) = ψj (ei ).

Further, by Proposition 4.3.1, heading (2), we have
                                                      0
                               ψj (aij
                                    n ) = ψj (ei ) = ν (ej (ek + el )). 

               4.6. The fundamental property of the elementary maps
   Proposition 4.6.1. For {i, j, k, l} = {1, 2, 3, 4} the following relations hold1
                                       ϕi ϕk ϕj + ϕi ϕl ϕj = 0,                         (4.33)


                                               ϕ2i = 0.                                 (4.34)
    Proof. For every vector v ∈ X01 , by definition of ϕi we have (ϕi + ϕj + ϕk + ϕl )(v) = 0,
see eq. (4.19). In other words, ϕi + ϕj + ϕk + ϕl = 0. Therefore,
                       ϕi ϕk ϕj + ϕi ϕl ϕj = ϕi (ϕi + ϕj )ϕj = ϕ2i ϕj + ϕi ϕ2j .
So, it suffices to prove that ϕ2i = 0. For every z ⊆ D 4 , by Corollary 4.3.2, headings (3) and
(1), we have
                       ϕ2i ((Φ+ )2 ρ)(z) ⊆ ϕi (ϕi ((Φ+ )2 ρ(I))) =
                       ϕi (Φ+ ρ(ei (ej + ek + el ))) ⊆ ϕi (Φ+ ρ(ei )) = 0. 
   Corollary 4.6.2. The relation
                                     ϕi ϕk ϕj (B) = ϕi ϕl ϕj (B)                        (4.35)
takes place2 for every subspace B ⊆ X02 , where X02 is the representation space of (Φ+  2
                                                                                     i ) ρ.

   Essentially, relations (4.33) and (4.35) are fundamental and motivate the construction of
the admissible sequences satisfying the following relation:
                                              ikj = ilj,                                (4.36)
where indices i, j, k, l are all distinct, see Table 4.2 and §4.1.

                       4.7. The ϕi −homomorphic elements in D 4
   By analogy with the modular lattice D 2,2,2 (see §1.6), we introduce now ϕi −homomorphic
polynomials in D 4 .
   An element a ⊆ D 4 is said to be ϕi −homomorphic, if
                        ϕi Φ+ ρ(ap) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(a)ϕi Φ+ ρ(p) for all p ⊆ D 4 .            (4.37)
   An element a ⊆ D 4 is said to be (ϕi , ek )−homomorphic, if
                       ϕi Φ+ ρ(ap) = ϕi Φ+ ρ(ek a)ϕi Φ+ ρ(p) for all p ⊆ ek .           (4.38)

   Theorem 4.7.1. 1) The polynomials aij
                                      n are ϕi −homomorphic .

   2) The polynomials aij
                       n are (ϕj , ek )−homomorphic for distinct indices {i, j, k}.


    Proof. 1) Follows from multiplicativity (4.29), Proposition 4.5.1 and the analog of Propo-
sition 2.4.3 for D 4 .
    2) For convenience, without loss of generality, we will show that

           4.8. The theorem on the classes of admissible elements in D 4
    Theorem 4.8.1. Let α = in in−1 . . . 1 be an admissible sequence for D 4 and i 6= in . Then
iα is admissible and, for zα = eα or fα0 from Table 4.3, the following relation holds1:
                                            ϕi Φ+ ρ(zα ) = ρ(ziα ).                     (4.43)
   For the proof of the theorem on admissible elements in D 4 , see §B.2. The proof repeatedly
uses the basic properties of the admissible sequences in D 4 considered in §4.8.1, Lemma 4.8.2.

   4.8.1. Basic properties of admissible elements in D 4 . We prove here a number of
basic properties2 of the atomic elements in D 4 used in the proof of the theorem on admissible
elements (Theorem 4.8.1). In particular, in some cases the lower indices of polynomials aij s
entering in the admissible elements fα0 can be transformed as in the following
    Lemma 4.8.2. 1) Every polynomial fα0 from Table 4.3 can be represented as an intersec-
tion of eα and P . For every i 6= in (see §1.7.2), we select P to be some ϕi −homomorphic
polynomial.
    2) The lower indices of polynomials aijs entering in the admissible elements fα0 can be
equalized as follows:
                          fα0 =f(21)t (41)r (31)s 0 =
                                                                                        (4.44)

The generic relation1 is the following:

does not change the polynomial ei (ei ajl   kj   kl
                                       t + ar+1 as−1 ), namely:

                               ei (ei ajl   kj   kl              jl   kj   kl
                                       t + ar+1 as−1 ) = ei (ei at + ar−1 as+1 ).               (4.47)
   4) The substitution (4.46) does not change the polynomial ei akj kl

    Proof. 1) We consider here only Line F 21 from Table 4.3, all other cases are similarly
considered. Every polynomial fα0 from Table 4.3 is the intersection eα and P , where P is
the sum contained in the parantheses, and polynomial fα0 can be represented in the different
equivalent forms, such that only the polynomial P is changed. For Line F 21, we have
                           fα0 =                         f(21)t (41)r (31)s 0 =

Relation (i) in (4.49) follows from the definition of Table 4.3 and (4.11). Relations (ii) in
(4.49) follow from the inclusion eα ⊆ e2 and permutation property (A.4). Relations (iii) and
(iv) follow from (4.11). Further, by (4.12)
                                                  eα ⊆ a31    31

and by permutation property (A.4) we have the relation (v).
   The polynomial P in (iv) is ϕ1 −homomorphic since
                                   e1 ⊆ a14    13                      34
                                         2r+1 a2s−1 and e2 e3 e4 ⊆ e2 a2t .

   The polynomial P in (iii) is ϕ3 −homomorphic since
                              e3 ⊆ a34                            14    13
                                    2t and e1 e2 e4 ⊆ e1 e2 ⊆ e2 a2r+1 a2s−1 .

   The polynomial P in (iii) is ϕ4 −homomorphic since
                              e4 ⊆ a43                            14    13
                                    2t and e1 e2 e3 ⊆ e1 e2 ⊆ e2 a2r+1 a2s−1 .

    Essentially, heading 1) allows to select an appropriate form of the polynomial P for every
given ϕi . 

     2) Let us prove (4.44). By (4.13) we have
                     eα (e2 a34    41    31            43       41    31

                     eα (a43             41    31             34            24 23
                          2t + (e4 + e2 a2r+1 a2s−1 )) = eα (a2t + e4 + e1 a2r a2s ) =

                     eα (a34       24 23
                          2t + e1 a2r a2s ).

     Now consider (4.45). Since ej ⊆ ajl
                                      t , by (4.13) we have

                         ei (ajl      kj   kl           jl            kj   kl
                              t + ei ar+1 as−1 ) = ei (at + (ej + ei ar+1 as−1 )) =

                         ei (ajl      ij   il
                              t + ek ar+1 as−1 )). 

     3) By (4.45) we have
                                 ei (ei ajl   kj   kl           jl      ij il
                                         t + ar+1 as−1 ) = ei (at + ek ar as ),

On the other hand
                                 ei (ei ajl   kj   kl
                                         t + ar−1 as+1 ) =

                                 ei (ei alj   kl   kj           lj      il ij
                                         t + as+1 ar−1 ) = ei (at + ek as ar ),
i.e.,
                               ei (ei ajl   kj   kl              jl   kj   kl
                                       t + ar+1 as−1 ) = ei (ei at + ar−1 as+1 ).
and (4.47) is true.
   4) By (4.13) we have
                          ei akj   kl
                              r+1 as−1 =

                          ei (ek + ej ailr )akl                 il kl
                                             s−1 = ei (ek + ej ar as−1 ) =

                          ei (ek + el aij   kj                 ij    kj      kl kj
                                       r−1 as ) = ei (ek + el ar−1 )as = ei ar as ,
i.e.,
                                            ei akj   kl        kl kj
                                                r+1 as−1 = ei ar as .                                 (4.50)
By repeating (4.50), we see that
                                          ei akj   kl        kj   kl
                                              r+1 as−1 = ei ar−1 as+1 .

The lemma is proved. 

     Conjecture 4.8.6. For every admissible sequence α, the elements eα (resp. fα0 ) and
ẽα (resp. f˜α0 ) coincide without restriction mod θ (see Proposition 4.8.3).
   In Propositions 4.8.4 and 4.8.5, this conjecture was proven for small values of lengths of
the admissible sequence α.

                            Modular and linear lattices

                                                  The notion of modular lattice misled logicians and
                                                  mathematicians for decades. . . . most examples of
                                                  modular lattices occurring in algebra and
                                                  combinatorics enjoy the stronger property of
                                                  being linear lattices. Unlike modular lattices, it is
                                                  not known whether linear lattices can not be
                                                  defined by identities alone . . . This lack of an
                                                  abstract definition is perhaps the reason why in
                                                  the past the theory of linear lattices was
                                                  subsumed into the theory of modular lattices.

                                                                    Mainetti M., Yan C. H., [MY99, p.12].




                   A.1. Distributive lattices and Boolean algebras
    A lattice is a set L with two commutative and associative operations: a sum and an
intersection. If a, b ∈ L, then we denote the intersection by ab and the sum by a + b. More
frequently the sum of a and b is denoted by a ∪ b or a ∨ b and the intersection is denoted by
a ∩ b or a ∧ b. Both operations are idempotent and satisfy the absorbtion law:

                          aa = a,           idempotency of intersection,
                          a + a = a,        idempotency of sum,
                          a(a + b) = a,     absorbtion law,
                          a + ab = a,       absorbtion law.

The sum and intersection of n elements a1 ,. . . ,an is denoted, respectively, by
                                       n
                                       X                 n
                                                         \
                                                ai and         ai
                                          i=1            i=1

On the lattice L, an order relation ⊆ (an inclusion) is defined:

                                a ⊆ b ⇐⇒ ab = a or a + b = b.

   A lattice L is said to be distributive if the following two distributive laws hold

                         a(b + c) = ab + ac              for every a, b, c ⊆ L,
                                                                                                   (A.1)
                         a + bc = (a + b)(a + c)         for every a, b, c ⊆ L.

   A distributive lattice L is said to be a Boolean algebra if L contains a minimal element
O and a maximal element I and, for each element a ∈ L, there exists a unique complement
                                                   87

a′ such that
                                          aa′ = O,
                                          a + a′ = I,
                                          (a′ )′ = a,                                  (A.2)
                                               ′     ′    ′
                                          (ab) = a + b ,
                                          (a + b)′ = a′ b′ .
An atom a of a Boolean algebra is a minimal nonzero element, i.e., if x ⊆ a then, either
x = O or x = a. An element y is atomless if there is no atom x such that x ⊆ y. A Boolean
algebra is atomic if there are no atomless elements.
    Fact A.1.1. Some infinite Boolean algebras do not contain any atoms. All finite Boolean
algebras are atomic, [BS81, p.135], [Hal63].
   A coatom a of a Boolean algebra is a maximal nonzero element, i.e., if x ⊇ a, then either
x = I or x = a.
    Fact A.1.2 (Stone, [Stn36]). Every finite Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean
algebra of all subsets of a finite set; in particular, the number of elements of every finite
Boolean algebra is a power of two, [Gr98, Ch.2].

                                     A.2. Modular lattices
     A lattice is said to be modular if, for every b, a, c ∈ L,
                                   a ⊆ b =⇒ b(a + c) = a + bc.                         (A.3)
    The relation (A.2) is said to be the modular law. The modular law is sometimes referred
to as Dedekind’s law. Every distributive lattice is modular but not conversely.
    A set of subspaces of the given vector space R (and, of course, submodules of the given
module M) form a modular lattice, namely if A, B, C ⊆ R and A ⊆ B, then
                                      B(A + C) = A + BC.
Indeed, the inclusion A+ BC ⊆ B(A+ C) holds, because A+ BC ⊆ A+ C and A+ BC ⊆ B.
Conversely, let x ∈ B(A + C), i.e., x ∈ B and x = xa + xc , where vectors xa and xc are
components of the vector x, such that xa ∈ A and xc ∈ C. Then xc = x − xa ∈ B, i.e.,
xc ∈ BC and xa + xc ∈ A + BC.
   The main properties of the modular lattices were derived by R. Dedekind [De1897],
[Bir48]. We need the two features of the modular lattice, which are called permutation
properties of the modular lattice or just permutation properties.
   Proposition A.2.1 (Permutation properties). In any modular lattice L, for every four
elements A, B, C, D ⊆ L, the following two permutation properties hold
                 A(B + CD) = A(CB + D) = A(CB + CD) for every A ⊆ C.                   (A.4)


       A + D(B + C) = A + B(D + C) = A + (D + C)(B + C) for every C ⊆ A.               (A.5)
     Proof. By the modular law (A.2) we have
                       A(B + CD) = AC(B + CD) = A(CB + CD) and
                       A(CB + D) = AC(CB + D) = A(CB + CD),

which proves (A.4). Similarly,
            A + D(B + C) = A + C + D(B + C) = A + (D + C)(B + C) and
            A + B(D + C) = A + C + B(D + C) = A + (B + C)(D + C),
which proves (A.5). 

                                  A.3. Hasse diagrams
    Hasse diagrams (also called upward drawings) are constructed to clear up the lattice by
eliminating obvious edges. The vertices are arranged vertically, so the directional arrows are
implied (always upwards) and omitted. Any edge implied by transitivity is not shown, i.e.,
if there is some element x such that a ⊆ x ⊆ b, then the edge [a, b] is not shown on the
Hasse diagram. On Fig. A.1, two Hasse diagrams are depicted: free distributive lattice D18
generated by three generators and free modular lattice M28 generated by three generators.
Lattices D18 and M28 are finite, D18 contains 18 elements and M28 contains 28 elements.

            A.4. A characterization of distributive and modular lattices
     Every distributive lattice L is also modular. Indeed, if a ⊆ b, then
                                  b(a + c) = ba + bc = a + bc,
i.e., (A.3) holds. The converse is false. Consider the diamond lattice M3 , see Fig. A.2. It
easily follows from the modular law (A.3) that the lattice M3 is modular. However, M3 is
not distributive, because
                    c(a + b) = c, but ca + cb = ab, i.e., c(a + b) 6= ca + cb,               (A.6)
see Fig. A.2. Further, the pentagon N5 is not a modular lattice, because
                x ⊆ y,    y(x + z) = y,     x + yz = x, i.e., y(x + z) 6= x + yz.            (A.7)
     The following characterization of modular lattices is well-known [Bir48].
   Proposition A.4.1. A lattice L is modular if and only if it does not contain pentagon
N5 as a sublattice.
     Proof. According to (A.7) L does not contain N5 , since N5 is not modular.

                                    We will show that, conversely, if L is not modular, then
                                    it must contain a pentagon. Let us suppose that there
                                    are three elements x, y, z such that
                                                      x ⊆ y,
                                                        x + yz 6= y(x + z),                 (A.8)
                                                        x + yz ⊆ y(x + z).
                                    The last inclusion in (A.8) is true in every lattice.

     Consider the sublattice generated by 5 the following elements:
                            yz ⊆ x + yz ⊆ y(x + z) ⊆ x + z and z.
We will show that this sublattice is isomorphic to N5 . For sums, we have
                         x + z ⊆ (x + yz) + z ⊆ y(x + z) + z ⊆ x + z,
and therefore
                         y(x + z) + z = x + z,     (x + yz) + z = x + z.
             A.4. A CHARACTERIZATION OF DISTRIBUTIVE AND MODULAR LATTICES                    91

For intersections, we have
                                   zy ⊆ z(x + yz) ⊆ zy
since x ⊆ y. Therefore z(x + yz) = zy. Besides, z(y(x + z)) = zy. Finally, let us show that
                                         yz 6= x + yz.
Suppose that yz = x + yz; then x ⊆ y and
                         yz = x + yz ⊆ y(x + z) ⊆ y(yz + z) = yz,
i.e., x + yz = y(x + z) which contradicts the hypothesis (A.8). 

    Proposition A.4.2 ([Bir48]). A lattice L is distributive if and only if it does not contain
sublattices M3 and N5 .
    Proof. According to (A.7), (A.6) any distributive lattice L does not contain M3 and N5 ,
since M3 and N5 are not distributive. Suppose, conversely, that L does not contain N5 .
Then by Proposition A.4.1 the lattice L is modular. Let L be not distributive.

                                                  We will show that, if L is not distributive,
                                                  then it must contain a diamond. Suppose
                                                  that there are three elements a, b, c that
                                                  sublattice {a, b, c} is not distributive. We
                                                  consider the sublattice generated by the
                                                  following elements p, r, s:
                                                              p = (ab + c)(a + b),
                                                              r = (ac + b)(a + c),      (A.9)
                                                              s = (bc + a)(b + c).

   Since the modular law holds in L, we have
        p + r =(ab + c)(a + b) + (ac + b)(a + c) = (a + b)(a + c)(ab + c + ac + b) =
                (a + b)(a + c)(c + b).
Similarly,
                        p + s = r + s = p + r = (a + b)(a + c)(b + c).                  (A.10)
In just the same way,
                  pr =(ab + c)(a + b)(ac + b)(a + c) = (ab + c)(ac + b) =
                       ac + b(ab + c) = ac + ab + bc,
and
                               ps = pr = rs = ac + ab + bc.                         (A.11)
We will show now that the elements p, r, s are distinct. Suppose, for example, that p = r.
Then
                                    p + r = p = r = pr
and
                            (a + b)(a + c)(b + c) = ac + ab + bc                    (A.12)
Consider now the intersection of both sides of the (A.12) with a:
                    a(b + c) = a(ac + ab + bc) = ac + ab + abc = ac + ab.
Similarly,
                          b(a + c) = ba + bc,    c(a + b) = ca + cb,
92                           A. MODULAR AND LINEAR LATTICES

which contradicts the hypothesis that {a, b, c} is not distributive. 
     The following proposition shows the equivalence of the two distributivity laws.
   Proposition A.4.3. Two following distributivity laws (see (A.1)) are equivalent for an
arbitrary lattice L:
                      (i)    a(b + c) = ab + ac             for every a, b, c ∈ L,
                      (ii)   a + bc = (a + b)(a + c)        for every a, b, c ∈ L
     Proof. Let us prove the implication (i) =⇒ (ii):
          (a + b)(a + c) = (a + b)a + (a + b)c = a + (a + b)c = a + ac + bc = a + bc.
Conversely, (ii) =⇒ (i):
           ab + ac = (ab + c)(ab + a) = (ab + c)a = (a + c)(b + c)a = a(b + c). 

     The following criterion of distributivity of the modular lattice is proved by B. Jonnson:
    Proposition A.4.4. ([Jo55, Th.5]) Let A be a modular lattice, p a positive integer, and
X1 , X2 , . . . , Xp nonempty linearly ordered subsets of A. For the sublattice of A generated by
the set
                                         X1 ∪ X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xp
to be distributive it is necessary and sufficient that, for any
                                 x1 ∈ X1 , x2 ∈ X2 , . . . , xp ∈ Xp ,
the sublattice of A generated by the set {x1 , x2 , ..., xp } be distributive. 

   We use this result for p = 3 in the proof of the distributivity of the sublattice of perfect
elements H + (n) in Proposition 3.1.2.

then the union D ∪ C is a 16-element Boolean algebra with coatoms d1 , d2 , d3 and Ic .

                           A.6. Representations of the modular lattices
    In this section we mostly follow definitions of Gelfand and Ponomarev [GP74].
    Let L be a modular lattice, X a finite dimensional vector space, L(X) the modular lattice
of linear subspaces in L. A morphism ρ : L −→ L(X) is called a linear representation of L
in the space X. Thus, the representation ρ : L −→ L(X) maps every element a ∈ L to the
subspace ρ(a) ⊆ X such that, for every a, b ∈ L, we have:
                                ρ(ab) = ρ(a)ρ(b),         ρ(a + b) = ρ(a) + ρ(b).
      Let ρ1 :−→ L(U) and ρ2 :−→ L(V ) be representations of L in the spaces U and V . We
put
                                   ρ(a) = ρ1 (a) ⊕ ρ2 (a)
for every a ∈ L, where the subspace ρ(a) ⊆ U ⊕ V is the set of all pairs
                                      {(u, v) | u ∈ ρ1 (a) and v ∈ ρ2 (a)}.
This correspondence gives the representation ρ in the space U ⊕ V . The representation ρ is
called the direct sum of representations ρ1 ⊕ ρ2 .
    The representation ρ is said to be decomposable if it isomorphic to a direct sum ρ1 ⊕ ρ2
of non-zero representations ρ1 and ρ2 . It is easy to prove that the representation ρ in the
space X is decomposable if and only if there are subspaces V and U such that X = U ⊕ V
and
                       ρ(a) = Uρ(a) + V ρ(a)       for every1  a ∈ L.
    The representation ρ is said to be indecomposable if there exists an element a ∈ L such
that
                                    ρ(a) 6= Uρ(a) + V ρ(a)
for every decomposition X into the direct sum X = U ⊕ V .
    Following [GP74] we introduce now the notions of perfect elements and linear equivalence
relation. The element a ∈ L is said to be perfect if either ρ(a) = 0 or ρ(a) = X for each
      1Recall   that U ρ(a) denotes the intersection of subspaces: U ρ(a) = U ∩ ρ(a).

indecomposable representation ρ of the modular lattice L, where X is the representation
space of ρ.
   Obviously, the sum and intersection of perfect elements is also a perfect element. Thus,
perfect elements form a sublattice in the lattice L.
   Two elements a, b ∈ L are called linearly equivalent if ρ(a) = ρ(b) for all indecomposable
representations ρ : L −→ L(X) and we write
                                       a ≡ b mod θ.                                   (A.34)
The relation θ is called the linear equivalence relation.
   We say that a property of L is true modulo linear equivalence if the property is true for
each indecomposable representation ρ of L.
   Let ρ be the representation of the modular lattice L in the vector space X. The subspace
U ⊆ X is said to be admissible with respect to ρ, if one of following two relations hold
                           (i) U(ρ(a) + ρ(b)) = Uρ(a) + Uρ(b),
                                                                                      (A.35)
                           (ii) U + ρ(a)ρ(b) = (U + ρ(a))(U + ρ(b))
for every a, b ∈ L. The equivalence of (i) and (ii) follows from Proposition A.4.3.
    Proposition A.6.1. ([GP74, Prop.2.1]) Let ρ be a representation of the lattice L in a
vector space X, let U be the subspace of X, and ∇ : X −→ X/U the canonical map. Then
the following relations are equivalent:
     (1) The subspace U is admissible with respect to ρ.
    (2) The map x 7−→ Uρ(x) defines a representation in the subspace U.
    (3) The mapping x 7−→ ∇ρ(x) defines a representation in the quotient space X/U.

   Proof. Let us prove the implication (1) =⇒ (2). If U is admissible with respect to ρ, then
                       Uρ(a + b) = U(ρ(a) + ρ(b)) = Uρ(a) + Uρ(b).
Besides,
                           Uρ(ab) = Uρ(a)ρ(b) = (Uρ(a))(Uρ(b)).
Thus, we have a representation in the subspace U. The representation in the subspace U is
called a subrepresentation of ρ and is denoted by ρU . 
   Conversely, (2) =⇒ (1):
                       ρU (a) + ρU (b) = ρU (a + b),
                       Uρ(a) + Uρ(b) = Uρ(a + b) = U(ρ(a) + ρ(b)).
So, we have (A.35,(i)). 
   Now, consider (1) =⇒ (3). Set
                                      ν(a) = ρ(a) + U,
Then (A.35,(ii)) is equivalent to the relation
                                      ν(a)ν(b) = ν(ab).                               (A.36)
Since, ker ∇ = U, we have ∇ρ(a) = ∇ν(a). Further,
       ∇ν(a + b) = ∇ρ(a + b) = ∇(ρ(a) + ρ(b)) = ∇ρ(a) + ∇ρ(b) = ∇ν(a) + ∇ν(b),
and (3) from Proposition A.6.1 is equivalent to the following relation:
                                 (∇ν(a))(∇ν(b)) = ∇ν(ab).                             (A.37)
96                         A. MODULAR AND LINEAR LATTICES

Thus, we just need to prove that (A.37) follows from (A.36). The inclusion
                                  (∇ν(a))(∇ν(b)) ⊇ ∇ν(ab)
is obvious, since ν(ab) ⊆ ν(a), ν(b). So, it is sufficient to prove that
                                  (∇ν(a))(∇ν(b)) ⊆ ∇ν(ab).                         (A.38)
Let z ∈ ∇ν(a) and z ∈ ∇ν(b). Then there exist vectors va ∈ ν(a) and va ∈ ν(b) such that
                                      ∇(va ) = ∇(vb ) = z.
Then, w = va − vb ∈ ker ∇ = U, so
                                vb = va − w ∈ ν(a) + U = ν(a),
i.e., vb ∈ ν(a), so
                                 vb ∈ ν(a)ν(b) = ν(ab)
and z ∈ ∇ν(ab), and hence (A.38) and (A.37) are proved. 
   Finally, consider the implication (3) =⇒ (1). We need to prove that (A.36) follows from
(A.37). Let v ∈ ν(a)ν(b), i.e.,
                        v ∈ ν(a) = ρ(a) + U, and v ∈ ν(b) = ρ(b) + U.
By (A.37) there exists w ∈ ν(ab) such that ∇(v) = ∇(w). Therefore, v − w ∈ U and
v ∈ ν(ab) + U = ν(ab). Thus, ν(a)ν(b) ⊆ ν(ab). The inverse inclusion is obvious and (A.36)
holds. 

A.7. A relation between representations of graphs and representation of lattices
  In a sense, representations of lattices are equivalent to the representations of graphs,
[BGP73], [Gab72]. We demonstrate this fact on the example of the graph Ẽ6 .
    Proposition A.7.1. Let ρ be the indecomposable representation of the diagram Ẽ6 ,
(A.39).

                                  ρ       Y3
                                          ↑    g3
                                         X3
If X0 6= 0, then maps fi and gi are monomorphisms.
    Proof. 1) Let g1 be not a monomorphism and G = ker g1 . Consider the subspace M in
X complementary to G in the direct sum X1 = G ⊕ M. Then ρ is the direct sum of the
following two subrepresentations:
                  M Y 1 X0 Y 2 X2                        G 0 0 0 0
                        Y3                     ⊕             0                     (A.40)
                        X3                                   0
Since ρ is an indecomposable representation, we see that ρ coincides with either the first
or the second summand in (A.40). Since X0 6= 0, we deduce that ρ coincides with the first
summand in (A.40) and G = 0 in the second summand. Thus, g1 is a monomorphism.
    2) Let us prove that f1 is a monomorphism. Let K = ker f1 and G = Img1 . Consider a
complementary subspace M to KG in K and a complementary subspace P to KG in G:
                               K = KG ⊕ M,         G = KG ⊕ P.                     (A.41)

                 Figure A.4.     Maps f1 and g1 . K = ker f1 , G = Img1

Then, we have
                         MG = MKG = 0,          P K = P KG = 0.                   (A.42)
Since P K = P (KG + M) = 0, we see that the subspaces P, M and KG form the direct sum

                                M ⊕ P ⊕ KG = K + G                                (A.43)
Further, there is a complementary subspace D to K + G in Y1 :
                               Y1 = (K + G) ⊕ D, i.e.,
                               Y1 = M ⊕ P ⊕ KG ⊕ D or                             (A.44)
                               Y1 = M ⊕ G ⊕ D.

    3) Since we already proved that g1 is monomorphism and g1−1(G ⊕ D) = X1 , we see that
ρ in the direct sum of following two subrepresentations:
          0 M 0 0 0                      X1 G ⊕ D X0 Y 2 X2
              0                ⊕                  Y3                              (A.45)
              0                                   X3
Since the representation ρ is indecomposable with X0 6= 0, it follows that M = 0. From
(A.41) and (A.44) we see that K = KG and K ⊆ G, i.e., ker f1 ⊆ Img1 , and therefore
                                    G = K ⊕ P,
                                                                                  (A.46)
                                    Y1 = K ⊕ P ⊕ D.
Since

    An analog of this proposition for an arbitrary star graph with orientation in which all
arrows directed to the branch vertex space X0 is also true, as one can show.
   Corollary A.7.2. The category of representations of the graph E          e6 with orientation
(A.39) coincides with the category of representations of the lattice D 2,2,2 in non-zero spaces:
                                   ρ : L −→ L(X0 ),       X0 6= 0.
    In particular, the Coxeter functors Φ+ , Φ− which appeared in the representation theory
of graphs ([BGP73], [GP74]) can be applied to the representations of lattices. The reflec-
tion functors from [BGP73] can not, however, be used because these functors change the
orientation of the graph.
    The representation ρ for which Φ+ ρ = 0 (resp. Φ− ρ = 0) is called the projective (resp.
injective). For every indecomposable representation ρ, the new indecomposable representa-
tion Φ+ ρ (resp. Φ− ρ) can be constructed except for the case where ρ is projective (resp.
injective).
    For example, we can construct a new indecomposable representation Φ+ ρ of E       e6 except
                                                                                    +
for seven indecomposable representations ρx0 and ρyi , ρxi , i = 1, 2, 3; for them Φ ρ = 0, see
Table A.7.
    By [GP79, Prop. 8,9] the projective indecomposable representations of any graph are
naturally enumerated by the vertices of the graph and can be recovered from the orientation
of the graph .
    If ρ is indecomposable and not projective, i.e., Φ+ ρ 6= 0, then ρ = Φ− Φ+ ρ.
    If ρ is indecomposable and not injective, i.e., Φ− ρ 6= 0, then ρ = Φ+ Φ− ρ.
    If ρ is indecomposable and (Φ+ )k ρ 6= 0, then ρ = (Φ− )k (Φ+ )k ρ.
    If ρ is indecomposable and (Φ− )k ρ 6= 0, then ρ = (Φ+ )k (Φ− )k ρ.
    The representation ρ is called preprojective if, for some projective representation ρ̃,
                     (Φ+ )k ρ = (Φ+ )k (Φ− )k ρ̃ = ρ̃,   (Φ+ )k+1ρ = Φ+ ρ̃ = 0.
     The representation ρ is called preinjective if, for some injective representation ρ̃,
                     (Φ− )k ρ = (Φ− )k (Φ+ )k ρ̃ = ρ̃,   (Φ− )k+1ρ = Φ− ρ̃ = 0.
     The representation ρ is called regular if (Φ+ )k ρ 6= 0 and (Φ+ )k ρ 6= 0 for every k ∈ Z.

                       A.8. The Coxeter functor Φ+ for D 2,2,2
    Let ρ be an indecomposable representation of E        e6 in a space X0 and ρ1 = Φ+ ρ an in-
decomposable representation of Ee6 in the space X 1 . According to [BGP73], the Coxeter
                                                         0
functor Φ+ is constructed as the sequence of reflection functors Fz+ , where z runs over the
            e6 :

                             Φ+ ρ = Fx+1 Fx+2 Fx+3 Fy+1 Fy+2 Fy+3 Fx+0 ρ .

                                           A.9. Linear lattices
    In this section, we mostly follow the definitions of the linear lattices from works of
M. Haiman [Hai85] and M. Mainetti, C. H. Yan [MY99].
    A set π of non-empty pairwise disjoint subsets such that their union coincides with A is
said to be a partition of the set A. The elements of π are called blocks of the partition π. If
elements a, b ∈ A lie in the same block π, we write
                                  a ≡ b mod π, or a ≡ b(π), or aπb.
    Proposition A.9.1. There exists a bijection between partitions π of the set A and equiv-
alence relations Rπ on the set A.
102                             A. MODULAR AND LINEAR LATTICES

      Proof. Given a partition π, we define the equivalence relation Rπ on the set A as follows:

                                < a, b >∈ Rπ ⇐⇒ aπb, or
                                                                                             (A.58)
                                    aRπ b       ⇐⇒ aπb.
Conversely, if R is an equivalence relation, then the partition π is defined to be:
                                           π = {[a]R | a ∈ A}.                              (A.59)

    Proposition A.9.2. The set of partitions Part(A) of set A constitutes a lattice called
the partition lattice.
      Proof. Let π1 , π2 be partitions of A:
                              [
                         π1 =     π1s , where π1s1 ∩ π1s2 = ∅ for all s1 , s2 ∈ S,
                                s∈S
                                [
                         π2 =         π1t , where π1t1 ∩ π1t2 = ∅ for all t1 , t2 ∈ T.
                                t∈T

For two partitions π1 and π2 , their intersection, inclusion and union are defined as follows.
Blocks of intersection are pairwise intersections of blocks of π1 and π2 .
                                    [
                        π1 ∩ π2 =        (π1s ∩ π2t ), for all s ∈ S, t ∈ T.           (A.60)
                                          s∈S,t∈T

Every block of π1 ⊆ π2 is included in some block of π2 .
                                π1 ⊆ π2 = {x ≡ y(π1) =⇒ x ≡ y(π2 )}.
The union π1 ∪ π2 is the intersection of all partitions π containing both π1 and π2 .
                                                \
                                   π1 ∪ π2 =         π. 
                                                       π1 ,π2 ⊆π

    Corollary A.9.3. The set of equivalence relations {Rπ } constitutes the lattice of equiv-
alence relations Rel(A) isomorphic to the partition lattice

    Proof. It follows from Propositions A.9.1 and A.9.2 
    Consider now commuting equivalence relations. Composition R ◦ T of relations R and T
is defined as follows:
            x(R ◦ T )y if and only if there exists z ∈ A such that xRz and zT y.             (A.62)
      Two equivalence relations R and T are said to commute1 if
                                                R ◦ T = T ◦ R.
    Definition A.9.4 ([MY99], [MY2000]). A linear lattice is a sublattice of the lattice
of equivalence relations (≃ partition lattice) on a set, with the property that any two equiv-
alence relations in the sublattice commute, in the sense of composition of relations.
      1It
      is easy to give an example of non-commuting equivalence relations: if R is “father of” and T is
“mother of”, then R and T do not commute, since RT is “maternal grandfather of” and T R is “paternal
grandmother of”, [Bz2001].

    The classic example of the linear lattice is the lattice of subspaces of a vector space V .
Any subspace S ⊆ V determines an equivalence relation RS on our vector space, given by
letting
                              x(RS )y if and only if x − y ∈ S.                         (A.63)
    Proposition A.9.5. 1) All equivalence relations produced, as in (A.63), by subspaces of
the vector space V , commute.
    2) Commuting equivalence relations given by (A.63) constitute the linear lattice.
    Proof. 1) We have
             x(RS1 ◦ RS2 )z if and only if x − y ∈ S1 and y − z ∈ S2 for some y.        (A.64)
By (A.64), we have
                                      x − z ∈ S1 + S2 .                               (A.65)
Conversely, suppose x − z = s1 + s2 , where s1 ∈ S1 and s2 ∈ S2 . Let y = z − s1 . Then
                              x − y = x − z + s1 = s2 ∈ S2 , and
                                                                                        (A.66)
                              y − z = z − s1 − z = −s1 ∈ S1 .
Thus, by (A.65), (A.65) and (A.66), we see that
                           x(RS1 ◦ RS2 )z if and only if x − z ∈ S1 + S2 .
Similarly,
                           x(RS2 ◦ RS1 )z if and only if x − z ∈ S2 + S1 ,
and therefore
                            x(RS1 ◦ RS2 )z if and only if x(RS2 ◦ RS1 )z,
i.e.,
                               RS1 ◦ RS2 = RS2 ◦ RS1 = RS1 +S2 .                       (A.67)
    2) By definition (A.9.4) it suffices to prove that the commuting equivalence relations
defined by (A.63) constitute a lattice. The equivalence relation corresponding to the sum of
subspaces S1 + S2 is defined by (A.67).
    By (A.9.4) blocks of the partition πS , corresponding to the equivalence relation RS are
cosets V /S. In other words, the partition πS consists of the blocks πSα as follows
                             πS = {πSα | x − y ∈ πSα ⇐⇒ x − y ∈ S},
By (A.60) the partition corresponding to the intersection of two relations S1 and S2 consists
of cosets V /(S1 ∩ S2 ), and
                                    πS1 ∩ πS2 = πS1 ∩S2 ,
i.e.,
                                 RS1 ∩ RS2 = RS1 ∩S2 . 

    Remark A.9.6. There are lots of linear lattices. Proposition A.9.5 can be generalized
to groups. Given any group G, each normal subgroup H determines an equivalence relation
on G, which we call RH , such that
                               x(RH )y     if and only if   xy −1 ∈ H.
So the lattice of normal subgroups of G becomes a linear lattice. Similarly, lattices of ideals
of a ring are also linear lattices, see Fig. 1.1.
104                            A. MODULAR AND LINEAR LATTICES

    Definition A.9.7 ([Jo53], [Sch45]). Let a0 , a1 , a2 , b0 , b1 , b2 be elements of the modular
lattice L, and let
                        zij = (ai + aj )(bi + bj ) for 0 ≤ i < j < 3,
                                                                                            (A.68)
                        z = z01 (z02 + z12 ).
The identity
                      (a0 + b0 )(a1 + b1 )(a2 + b2 ) ⊆ a0 (z + a1 ) + b0 (z + b1 )   (A.69)
is called the Arguesian law and lattices satisfying the Arguesian law are called Arguesian
lattices. For another version of the Arguesian law, see [MY2000, p.3] and [Hai85]. Iden-
tity (A.69) is a lattice-theoretic form of the Desargues theorem of projective geometry, see
[Sch45], [MY2000, p.2], [Gr98, Ch.4].
   Remark A.9.8. Every Arguesian lattice is modular, see [Jo54, Th.1.9]. There exists
modular lattices which are not Arguesian, see [Gr98, Ch.4.§5]. Linear lattices are Arguesian,
but the converse is not true: in [Hai91] M. Haiman constructed a family of Arguesian lattices
which cannot be represented as linear lattices, see [KY2003], see Fig. 1.1.

                A.10. Grassmann-Cayley algebras and modular lattices
    A.10.1. A Peano space and the bracket. A Grassmann-Cayley algebra (or double
algebra) is essentially the exterior algebra of a vector space, equipped with two operations,
join1 ∨ and meet ∧, which are the algebraic analogs of the union2 ∪ and intersection ∩ of
subspaces of a vector space:
                          the join ∨        ←→         the union ∪ ( the sum +)
                                                                                                     (A.70)
                         the meet ∧         ←→             the intersection ∩
These operations were introduced by Grassmann [Gra11], under the name of progressive
and regressive products. In works of G.-C.Rota and his coworkers, the Grassmann work has
been recognized and extended, see [DRS76], [BBR85].
    Barnabei, Brini and Rota [BBR85, p. 121] write “To the best of our knowledge of
published work, the first mathematicians to understand, albeit imperfectly, the program
Ausdehnungslehre 3 were Clifford and Schröder, first, and later A. N. Whitehead, Élie Cartan,
and best of all Giuseppe Peano. ... It was Schröder, in an appendix to his Algebra and Logik,
who first stressed the analogy between the algebra of progressive and regressive products,
and the algebra of sets with union and intersection.”
    By analogy to a Hilbert space endowed with a symmetric bilinear form (x, y), called
the inner product, and to a symplectic space endowed with an antisymmetric bilinear form
[x, y], a Peano space is a vector space V of dimension n, endowed with an antisymmetric
non-degenerate multilinear form [x1 , . . . , xn ] defined for xi ∈ V , called the bracket [BBR85].
      1The classical Grassmann algebra is the exterior algebra of a vector space, equipped with only one
operation, the wedge product ∧. Barnabei, Brini and Rota [BBR85, p. 127] write “The product in the
exterior algebra is called the join and is denoted by the symbol ∨. We note that the usage is at variance
with ordinary usage, where exterior multiplication is denoted by the wedge ∧. This departure from common
usage will be amply justified in the sequel.” For motivation of the usage the symbol ∨, see §A.10.2.
    2This lattice-theoretic operation union ∪ does not coincide with the set-theoretic operation union ⊔. For
vector spaces, the operation union ∪ is the linear span of the union ⊔ as follows:
                                              A ∪ B = A ⊔ B.
The equivalent notation frequently used instead the operation union ∪ is the operation sum +.
    3Grassmann’s program Ausdehnungslehre refers to 1844, see [Gra11]. The English translation of Aus-
dehnungslehre is geometric calculus. Grassmann’s idea was to develop a calculus for the join and meet. In
[BBR85] authors consider Grassmann’s geometric calculus and its relevance in invariant theory.

The group of all linear transformations preserving the bracket is SL(V ), the special linear
group. The algebra of SL(V )-invariants is generated by brackets (the first fundamental
theorem of invariant theory, see [Weyl46, Th. II.6.A]) or [Dol2003, Th. 2.1]).
    Let K be the ground field. A bracket (of step n) over the space V is a non-degenerate
alternating n-linear form, i.e., a function
                                       x1 , . . . , xn 7−→ [x1 , . . . , xn ] ∈ K,
where vectors x1 , . . . , xn lie in the vector space V , with the following properties:
     (1) [x1 , . . . , xn ] = 0      if at least two among the x’s coincide;
     (2)    for every x, y ∈ V            and α, β ∈ K
           [x1 , . . . , xi−1 , αx + βy, xi+1, . . . , xn ] =                                                        (A.71)
                       α[x1 , . . . , xi−1 , x, xi+1 , . . . , xn ] + β[x1 , . . . , xi−1 , y, xi+1, . . . , xn ];
     (3) there exists a basis {b1 , . . . , bn } of V such that [b1 , . . . , bn ] 6= 0.
    Let F (V ) be the free associative algebra with unity over K generated by the elements of a
Peano space V . The exterior algebra E(V ) of the Peano space V is obtained as the quotient
of F (V ) modulo the ideal generated by v 2 , for all v ∈ V , see, for example, [MY99, Def. 2.1]
or [BBR85, Prop. 3.6]. For further properties of the exterior algebra see, e.g., [Gre67]. For
exterior Grassmann algebra in the context of supersymmetries, see, e.g., [Ber87] or [L05].
    Let
                                        Φ : F (V ) → E(V ),
denote the canonical projection. If x1 x2 . . . xk is a word in F (V ), we denote its image by
                                     Φ(x1 x2 . . . xk ) = x1 ∨ x2 ∨ · · · ∨ xk .                                     (A.72)
The element x1 ∨ x2 ∨ · · · ∨ xk is called an extensor of step k, or decomposable antisym-
metric tensor or decomposable k-vector. The join of two extensors is an extensor. A linear
combination of extensors of step k is called an antisymmetric tensor of step k, [BBR85].
   Proposition A.10.1. (Properties of the join, [BBR85, Prop. 3.1-3.4]) 1) For every
permutation σ of {1, 2, . . . , k} we have
                           xσ(1) ∨ xσ(2) · · · ∨ xσ(k) = sign(σ)x1 ∨ x2 · · · ∨ xk .                                 (A.73)
    2) Let Ek (V ) be the subspace of E(V ) generated by all extensors of step k. Let A ∈
Ej (V ), B ∈ Ek (V ). Then
                                 B ∨ A = (−1)jk A ∨ B.                                               (A.74)
                     
                     n
   3) dim Ek (V ) =     for 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and hence dim E(V ) = 2n .
                     k
   4) Let B be a dimension k > 0 subspace of V , let {x1 , x2 , . . . , xk } and {y1 , y2 , . . . , yk } are
two bases of B. Then
                           x1 ∨ x2 · · · ∨ xk = Cy1 ∨ y2 · · · ∨ yk                                  (A.75)
for some non-zero scalar C.
    By Proposition A.10.1, heading 4) there exists one-to-one correspondence (up to non-
zero scalar multiple) between non-trivial subspaces of V and non-zero extensor uniquely
representing this subspace. Such a representing extensor is said to be associated to the
subspace.
106                            A. MODULAR AND LINEAR LATTICES

    A.10.2. Motivation of the usage the symbol ∨. Here we formulate the main prop-
erty of the operation join ∨ connecting it with the lattice-theoretic operation sum + (or,
equivalently, with the union ∪), see [BBR85, Prop. 3.5].
    Proposition A.10.2. Let A, B be two subspaces of V associated to extensors F and G,
respectively. Then
    (i) F ∨ G = 0 if and only if A ∩ B 6= 0;
    (ii) if A ∩ B = 0, then the extensor F ∨ G is assosiated to the subspace generated by
A + B.
      Reformulate Proposition A.10.2 as follows. Let
                                          F = f1 ∨ f2 ∨ · · · ∨ fj ,
                                                                                                            (A.76)
                                          G = g1 ∨ g2 ∨ · · · ∨ gk ,

and F (resp. G) denotes the linear span of extensor F (resp. G).

      If vectors
                                        f1 , f2 , . . . , fj , g1 , g2 , . . . , gk
are distinct and linearly independent, i.e. F ∩ G = 0, then
                                               F ∨ G = F + G.                                               (A.77)
Thus, the join operation ∨ on extensors represents the geometric operation of the lattice
sum of subspaces of V at least for independent vectors. This is one of motivations to use
the symbol ∨.
    Another motivation is a discovery of a class of identities that hold in the exterior algebras,
which turn into the classical theorems of projective geometry on the incidence of subspaces
of projective spaces, and therefore to identities in modular lattices, see (A.70).
    For more details concerning these identities, see [Haw94], [Haw96], [MY2000], [MY99].
    Theorems such as Desargues, Pappus, Bricard, and Fontené of classical projective geom-
etry are revealed to be expressible as simple and elegant identities holding among joins
and meets of extensors in the framework of the Grassmann-Cayley algebra, [BBR85],
[MY99], [MY2000]. We suggest to call the transformation of modular lattice polyno-
mials to Grassmann-Cayley algebra polynomials and vice versa by the substitution (A.70)
the Rota rendering. The Rota rendering establishes a connection between the theory of
Grassmann-Cayley algebras and the modular (and even linear) lattices.

    A.10.3. The meet. A similar operation on extensors should be defined for the lattice
operation intersection of two subspaces. This is the meet operation. Let extensors F and G
are given by (A.76) with j + k ≥ n, where n is dimension of a Peano space V . Then
                           X
                   F ∧G=       sign(σ)[aσ(1) , . . . , aσ(d−k) , b1 , . . . , bk ]aσ(d−k+1) . . . aσ(j) .   (A.78)
                           σ

    The meet is associative and anti-commutative in the following sense ([BBR85, Prop.
4.4]):
                                     F ∧ G = (−1)(d−k)(d−j) G ∧ F.                                          (A.79)
    Both the join and meet are defined on extensors only, but the definitions are extended
to arbitrary elements of E(V ) by distributivity.
                 A.10. GRASSMANN-CAYLEY ALGEBRAS AND MODULAR LATTICES                          107

   Proposition A.10.3. ([BBR85, Prop. 4.3], [MY99, Prop. 2.5]) 1) We have
                       F ∧ G = 0 if and only if F + G does not span V.
   2) If F + G spans V , then1
                                        F ∧ G = F ∩ G.                                     (A.80)
   Thus the meet operation corresponds to the intersection ∩. A basis {e1 , . . . , en } in the
space V is said to be unimodular if [e1 , . . . , en ] = 1. The extensor
                                     E = e1 ∨ e2 ∨ · · · ∨ en
in E(V ) is called the integral. Indeed, it corresponds to the Berezin integral on supermani-
folds, cf. [Ber87], [L05]. The integral is well defined and does nor depend on the choice of
a unimodular basis.
    A.10.4. Note on Howe-Huang projective invariants of quadruples. Projective
invariants of quadruples were obtained by Howe R., Huang R. in [HH96]. They gave an
explicit set of generators for the ring of invariants of a set of four subspaces in a projective
space.
   Remark A.10.4. For other results in this direction, see [Gro98], [Rin80]. In [Gro98],
Grosshans gave a complete description of the relationship between invariants and quadruples.
Invariants of the tame quivers were obtained by Ringel in [Rin80].
    Among projective invariants of quadruples obtained by Howe-Huang, the invariants of
type III ([HH96, Th. 14]) can be transformed to the polynomials fGC (E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 ) in four
subspaces E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 under the join ∨ and meet ∧ in the framework of the Grassmann-
Cayley algebra. The transformation of Howe-Huang projective invariants to polynomials
fGC (E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 ) is performed by means of the Cayley factorization in the sense of [Wh91].
    Further, applying the Rota rendering (A.70) to fGC (E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 ), we get polyno-
mials fM L (E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 ) in the modular lattice D 4 . It may be shown that polynomials
fM L (E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 ) are admissible elements in D 4 .

see (1.8), (1.9).

       B.1. A proof of the theorem on admissible elements in lattice D 2,2,2
   We will now prove the main property of admissible elements.
   Theorem 2.12.1 Let α = in in−1 . . . 1 be an admissible sequence and i 6= in . Then iα is
admissible and, for zα = fα , eα , gα0 from the Table 2.3, the following relation holds:
                                                  ϕi Φ+ ρ(zα ) = ρ(ziα ).                                   (B.2)

Applying Corollary 2.4.4 to y1 y2 and Corollary 2.7.4 to a13     32
                                                          q and Ak−1 we have

Since a13         32
        q and Ak−1 are the ϕ3 −homomorphic polynomials (Theorem 2.8.1), we see that
“intersection of relations” (B.5) gives us relation (B.4). If q = 1, then

By Corollary 2.7.4 we have

                                         q 7−→ y3 Aq .

Since a13    32                                  13
        q , Ak−1 are ϕ3 −homomorphic and Ak is (ϕ3 , y2 )−homomorphic (Theorem 2.8.1),
and y3 A12
         q+1 ⊆ y3 (y1 + x2 ), we see that (B.6) comes out from (B.7). As in the previous case,
we have the same result for q = 1. 
   (G) Line 1. It will be shown that
                              ϕ3
                       gγ0 7−→ g3γ0 ,
                                                       ϕ3                                         (B.8)
                       gγ0 = eγ (x1 + a32 32                    12 31
                                       q Ak ) 7−→ e3γ (y2 y3 + Aq ak ) = g3γ0 .
                         ϕ3
By (B.6) we have eγ 7−→ e3γ . By basic relations (2.4.1) and atomic multiplicativity (2.5.2)
we have
                       ψ3 (x1 + a32 32                    32      32
                                 q Ak ) = ψ3 (x1 ) + ψ3 (aq )ϕ3 (Ak ).
According to Proposition 2.7.1 (the joint map actions) we obtain
         ϕ3 (x1 + a32 32     0            0     12               31      0             12 31
                   q Ak ) = ν (y2 y3 ) + ν (y3 Aq (y3 (y1 + y2 )ak )) = ν (y2 y3 + y3 Aq ak ).

Therefore by Proposition 2.4.3 (the connection) we see that x1 + a32 32
                                                                  q Ak is ϕ3 −homomorphic
and
                                        ϕ3
                      x1 + a32 32                12 31               12 31
                            q Ak 7−→ y2 y3 + y3 Aq ak = y3 (y2 y3 + Aq ak ).
By (B.6) e3γ ⊆ y3 , hence we get (B.8). 

By Corollary 2.7.4

                                              k−1 7−→ y1 Ak−1 .

As above, a31k−1 and x1 + x2 are ϕ1 −homomorphic (Theorem 2.8.1) then “intersection of
                                                                        ϕ1

Since aq+1 ⊆ y2 + y3 , we have the same result. 

The following relations are true (Corollary 2.7.4):

                                              k 7−→ y1 (y2 + y3 )ak ,
                                                    ϕ1

                                              k 7−→ y1 Ak ⊆ y2 + y3 .

Then (B.31) follows from (B.32). 
                        ϕ1
   (G) Line 1 (p = 0) 7−→ Line 7. We need to show
                         ϕ1
               g(21)2k 0 7−→ g1(21)2k 0 ,

               g(21)2k 0 = e(21)2k (x1 + a32 32                    21      31
                                          k Ak ) 7−→ e1(21)2k (y2 ak + y3 ak ) = g1(21)2k 0 .

Since A32           13            32               32 32      13        32
       k = y3 + x2 Ak−1 and x2 ⊆ ak , we see that ak Ak = x2 Ak−1 + y3 ak and

                      x1 + a32 32            32        13     13        13
                            k Ak = (x1 + y3 ak ) + x2 Ak−1 = ak+1 + x2 Ak−1 .

The transformation is well-defined because k > 0 (see Table 2.3). Further, since e(21)2k ⊆
A13
 k−1 (by Table 2.3), we have

          e(21)2k (x1 + a32 32              13        13                     13   13
                         k Ak ) = e(21)2k (ak+1 + x2 Ak−1 ) = e(21)2k (x2 + ak+1 Ak−1 ).        (B.34)
Apply now ϕ1 . The polynomial x2 + a13   13                                   13   13
                                    k+1 Ak−1 is ϕ1 −homomorphic because x1 ⊆ ak+1 Ak−1 .

         B.1. A PROOF OF THE THEOREM ON ADMISSIBLE ELEMENTS IN LATTICE D2,2,2                       115

Since e1(21)2k+1 ⊆ y1 , we get
                           ϕ1
  e(21)2k (x1 + a32 32                              23   12                           23   12
                 k Ak ) 7−→ e1(21)2k+1 (y1 y3 + y1 Ak+1 ak−1 ) = e1(21)2k+1 (y1 y3 + Ak+1 ak−1 ). (B.36)

Since e1(21)2k+1 ⊆ a12
                    k−1 , we have

           e1(21)2k+1 (y1 y3 + A23   12                   23           12
                                k+1 ak−1 ) = e1(21)2k+1 (Ak+1 + y1 y3 ak−1 ) =

           e1(21)2k+1 (y2 + x3 A12         12                           12          12
                                k + y1 y3 ak−1 ) = e1(21)2k+1 (y2 + y3 Ak (x3 + y1 ak−1 )) =

           e1(21)2k+1 (y2 + y3 A12 31
                                k ak ).

Again, by Table 2.3 e1(21)2k+1 ⊆ y1 ⊆ A12
                                       k , therefore the last polynomial is equal to

                                           e1(21)2k+1 (y2 A12      31
                                                           k + y3 ak ),

i.e.,
                        e1(21)2k+1 (y1 y3 + A23   12                      12      31
                                             k+1 ak−1 ) = e1(21)2k+1 (y2 Ak + y3 ak ).          (B.37)
(B.33) follows from (B.37) and from the next lemma.
    Lemma B.1.1. The following relation takes place
                         e1(21)2k+1 (y2 A12      31                    21      31
                                         k + y3 ak ) = e1(21)2k+1 (y2 ak + y3 ak ).             (B.38)
    Proof. Indeed,
                e1(21)2k+1 (y2 A12      31                             31          31
                                k + y3 ak ) = e1(21)2k+1 (y2 (y1 + x2 Ak−1 ) + y3 ak ) =

                e1(21)2k+1 (y2 y1 + x2 A31        31
                                        k−1 + y3 ak ).

Since e1(21)2k+1 ⊆ A31
                    k−1 , we have

                e1(21)2k+1 (y2 A12      31                      31               31
                                k + y3 ak ) = e1(21)2k+1 (x2 + Ak−1 (y1 y2 + y3 ak )) =

                e1(21)2k+1 (x2 + y1 y2 A31        31
                                        k−1 + y3 ak ).

Further, by basic relations (Table 2.1, 4.1) we have
                 e1(21)2k+1 (y2 A12      31                            13        31
                                 k + y3 ak ) = e1(21)2k+1 (x2 + y1 y2 ak−1 + y3 ak ) =

                 e1(21)2k+1 (y2 (x2 + y2 a13          31                    21      31
                                          k−1 ) + y3 ak ) = e1(21)2k+1 (y2 ak + y3 ak ).

Thus, the lemma is proven, (B.38) and so (B.33) are true. 

The following relations are true (Corollary 2.7.4):
                                               ϕ2
                                           x1 7−→ y2 y3 ,
                                                ϕ2
                                           A23                  21

                                            k 7−→ y2 Ak ⊆ y1 + y3 .

Then (B.39) follows from (B.40). 

Transform the last polynomial from (B.54):

Then (B.52) follows from the next lemma.
   Lemma B.1.2. We have

   Proof. Indeed,
                 e1(21)2k+1 (y1 A31        23                             23        23

                                         k + y2 ak ).

Since e1(21)2k+1 ⊆ A23     23
                    k+1 ⊆ Ak , it follows that

                 e1(21)2k+1 (y1 A31        23                      23             23

118                     B. A PROOF OF THE THEOREM ON ADMISSIBLE CLASSES

      By basic relations of atomic elements (Table 2.1, 4.1) we have

      Now,
                      e1(21)2k+1 (y1 a13        23                     13             23

First, since e1(21)2k+1 ⊆ y1 , we have
                        e1(21)2k+1 (y1 a12        13                            23         32

Since x2 ⊆ y2 a23                            23         32
               k and the polynomial x1 + y2 ak + y1 y3 ak meets the requirements of atomic
multiplicativity (Corollary 2.5.2), we have

We transform the last polynomial. Since e(21)2k+2 ⊆ y2 , it follows that
         e(21)2k+2 (y2 y3 + x2 (y1 + y3 )A13                12
                                          k + y2 (x1 + x3 )Ak ) =

Since e(21)2k+2 ⊆ a12
                   k , we see by permutation property (A.4) that

e(21)2k+2 (y2 y3 + x2 A13           12                          12             13

        B.2. A proof of the theorem on admissible elements in lattice D 4
    Every element eα from Table 4.3 is the intersection of three polynomials. In all cases,
two of these polynomials are ϕi −homomorphic under action ψi . The third one is not
ϕi −homomorphic, but satisfies the following relation:
                                                     ϕi
                                           ej ekl        kl

see Corollary 4.5.2, heading(3).
    In this proof, we repeatedly use the basic properties of admissible elements from Lemma
4.8.2, §4.8.1.

Since a31      34
       2s and a2t−1 are ϕ3 −homomorphic (Corollary 4.4.2), we get (B.62). The polynomial

                              yi aik kj      ik                   ik
                                  m an = yi am (yj + xk (xj + yi an−2 )).

Since aik
       n−2 ⊇ xk , we have

                              yi aik kj      ik                   ik
                                  m an = yi am (yj + xk (yi + xj an−2 )).

Further, by Table 2.1, Line 3.1, we have xj aik        ki
                                             n−2 = xj An−2 and

                     yi aik kj      ik                   ki           ik jk
                         m an = yi am (yj + xk (yi + xj An−2 )) = yi am An . 


   2) Since
                                                  ij                               ij
              yi Aji jk      ji                                ji
                  m an = yi Am (xj + yk (xk + yi an−2 )) = yi Am (xj + xk + yk yi an−2 )

and by Table 2.1, Line 4.1, we have yk yi aij           ji
                                           n−2 = yk yi An−2 , and
                                                                 ji
                              yi Aji jk      ji
                                  m an = yi Am (xj + xk + yk yi An−2 ).

Since Aji     ji
       n−2 ⊇ Am , we see that
                                              ji
                   yi Aji jk      ji
                       m an = yi Am (yk yi + An−2 (xj + xk )) =
                                           ji                               ji
                   yi Aji                              ji
                       m (yk yi + xj + xk An−2 ) = yi Am (xj + yk (yi + xk An−2 )).

Further,
                                       yi + xk Aji        ji
                                                n−2 ⊇ yi Am ,

and we have
                                                        ji
                    yi Aji jk      ji                                ji kj
                        m an = yi Am (yk + xj (yi + xk An−2 )) = yi Am An . 

128              C. THE INCLUSION THEOREM AND PROPERTIES OF H + (n)

      C.1.2. The a-form and A-form of admissible elements.
      Proposition C.1.2. For all admissible elements fα and eα of Table 2.3,
       (1) Every symbol “A” can be substituted by the symbol “a”.
       (2) Every symbol “a” can be substituted by the symbol “A”.

    The substitutions A ←→ a are collected in Table C.1. The original form of admissible
elements is given by Table 2.3. Two other forms of admissible elements are given by Propo-
sition C.1.2. The substitution (1) (resp. (2)) from Proposition C.1.2 is said to be an a-form
(resp. A-form). (Table C.1).
   Proof of Proposition C.1.2. For elements fα , both statements (1) and (2) of Proposition
C.1.2 follow from Table 2.1, headings (3.1), (4.1) and (5.2). For convenience, we give these
properties here:
                      xk Aij        ji
                            n = xk an                       (Table 2.1, Line 3.1),
                      yi yj An = yi yj aik
                             ki
                                        n                   (Table 2.1, Line 4.1),
                      yi (xj + xk )Aij                 ji
                                     n = yi (xj + xk )an    (Table 2.1, Line 5.2).
Consider elements eα . We will use Proposition C.1.2 and property 5.1 from Table 2.1. We
have
                 aij  jk    ji jk
                   n am = An am for n ≤ m + 1       (Table 2.1, Line 5.1).
   Line 1, Line 9 of Table 2.3. Take Line 1:
                                       eα = y2 A32   21 13 13
                                                k−1 aq Ak aq .

According to Line 5.1 of Table 2.1, we have
                           a21 13   12 13             32   12 13 13
                            q aq = Aq aq and eα = y2 Ak−1 Aq Ak aq .

Further, by Proposition C.1.1, (2) we have
                       y2 A12 13      12 31             32   12 13 31
                           k aq = y2 Ak Aq and eα = y2 Ak−1 Aq Ak Aq .

This is the A-form of eα .
   On the other hand, by Proposition C.1.1, (2) we have
                       y2 A32   13      32   31             32   21 31 13
                           k−1 Ak = y2 Ak−1 ak and eα = y2 Ak−1 aq ak aq .

Again, by Line 5.1 of Table 2.1, we have
                          A32   31   23   31             23   21 31 13
                           k−1 ak = ak−1 ak and eα = y2 ak−1 aq ak aq .

It is the a-form of eα . The same for Line 9 of Table 2.3. 
      Line 2, Line 10 of Table 2.3. For Line 2, we have
                                      eα = y3 a31   12   12 23
                                               k−1 Aq+1 ak Aq .

By Table 2.1, Line 5.1 we have
                        a31   12   13   12             13   12   12 23
                         k−1 ak = Ak−1 ak and eα = y3 Ak−1 Aq+1 ak Aq .

By proposition C.1.1, (2) we obtain
                y3 A13   12      13   21             13   12   21 23
                    k−1 ak = y3 Ak−1 Ak and eα = y3 Ak−1 Aq+1 Ak Aq         (A-form).
      On the other hand, by proposition C.1.1, (2) we have
                      y3 A23 12        23 21               31   21   12 23
                          q Aq+1 = y3 Aq aq+1 and eα = y3 ak−1 aq+1 ak Aq .

130              C. THE INCLUSION THEOREM AND PROPERTIES OF H + (n)

   Lines 3–6, Lines 11–14 of Table 2.3. The proof for Line 3 follows from Line 1 under
substitution 1 −→ 3 −→ 2 −→ 1. Under the same substitution the case of Line 11 follows
from the case of Line 10. Similarly, by the same substitution we have
                           Line 1 =⇒ Line 3 =⇒ Line 5,
                           Line 9 =⇒ Line 11 =⇒ Line 13,
                           Line 2 =⇒ Line 4 =⇒ Line 6,
                           Line 10 =⇒ Line 12 =⇒ Line 14. 
   Lines 7-8, Table 2.3. Let us take Line 7, where eα = y1 A31 12 23 23
                                                            k ak Ak ak . By Proposition
C.1.1, (2) we have
                        y1 A23 23      23 32             31 12 23 32
                            k ak = y1 Ak Ak and eα = y1 Ak ak Ak Ak .

Again,
                  y1 A32 12      32 21              31 21 23 32
                      k ak = y1 Ak Ak , so eα = y1 Ak Ak Ak Ak            (A-form).
      On the other hand, by Proposition C.1.1, (2) we have
                         y1 A31 23      31 32             31 12 32 23
                             k Ak = y1 Ak ak and eα = y1 Ak ak ak ak .

By Table 2.1, Line 5.1 we have
                      A31 32   13 32              13 12 32 23
                       k ak = ak ak , so eα = y1 ak ak ak ak           (a-form).
The same for Line 8 of Table 2.3. 
   Remark C.1.3 (to Table C.2). Transformation T 123 substitutes 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 and
 12
T substitutes 1 → 2 → 1. These transformations are needed for getting corresponding
admissible elements gα0 from the Table 2.3 or their a-forms and A-forms from Table C.1.
For example, consider Line 2. In this case α = (321)2p (32)2k . This sequence can be obtained
by applying T 123 to the sequence α̃ = (213)2p (21)2k from Table 2.3, i.e.,
                       α = (321)2p (32)2k = T 123 [α̃] = T 123 [(213)2p (21)2k ].
    C.1.3. Admissible sequences α1 and α. The inclusion theorem. Our intention
is to prove the following theorem.

    Theorem 2.13.1 For every admissible sequence α or αi, where i = 1, 2, 3 from Table
2.2, the following inclusion holds:
                                      eαi ⊆ gα0 ,     i = 1, 2, 3.
   Without loss of generality it suffices to prove Theorem 2.13.1 for i = 1. Thus, we need
description of admissible sequences α1 and α in the form of sequences of Table 2.3.
   Proposition C.1.4. For the corresponding indices α1 and α from Table C.2 (columns
2 and 3), we have
                                    ϕα (1) = α1.
      Proof. Line 1. Let p > 0. We have
                     ϕ21(321)2p−1 (32)2k (1) = 21(321)2p−1(32)2k 1 =
                     21(321)(321)2p−2(32)2k 1 = 213((21)(321)2p−2(32)2k 1).
By induction, from Line 4, Table C.2 we get
                ϕ21(321)2p−1 (32)2k (1) = 213[(213)2p−1(21)2k ] = (213)2p (21)2k = α1.
If p = 0, then 2(12)2k 1 = (21)2k+1. The same for Line 9. 

      Proof. 1) Since eα ⊆ A31   31
                            q ⊆ Aq−1 , we see that

   Since y2 y1 A31           13
                q−1 = y2 y1 aq−1 and eα ⊆ y2 , it follows that

                eα (y2 y1 + A31   23               13     23            13        23
                             q−1 ak ) = eα (y2 y1 aq−1 + ak ) = eα (y1 aq−1 + y2 ak ).

Finally, since x2 ⊆ y2 a23             13
                        k and x1 ⊆ y1 aq−1 , it follows that

                     q−1 ak ) = eα ((x2 + y1 aq−1 ) + (x1 + y2 ak )) = eα (aq + ak+1 ). 

   1′ ) Since eα ⊆ y2 , we have
                              eα (y2 a21      23         21      23
                                      k + y2 ak ) = eα (ak + y2 ak ).

Since x1 ⊆ a21
            k , we have

               eα (y2 a21      23         21            23          21   12

   2) Since
                          a13             32      32        32
                           q = x1 + y3 aq−1 ⊇ y3 aq−1 ⊇ y3 aq ⊇ eα
(Table C.1, Line 2, a-form), it follows that

                              q Ak ) = eα (x2 aq + Ak ) = eα (x2 Aq + Ak ).

Further, since y1 ⊆ A13
                     k , it follows that

               eα (x2 + a13 13                 31   13         12     13

   3) Since eα ⊆ A23     23
                  q+1 ⊆ Aq , we see that

                 eα (y3 y1 + A23 12               23   12               32   12

Since eα ⊆ y1 , it follows that

                                 q + ak ) = eα (y3 aq + y1 ak ) =

                      eα (x1 + y3 a32           12         13     31
                                   q + x3 + y1 ak ) = eα (aq+1 + ak+1 ). 

   4) Since a32             21      21
             q+1 = x3 + y2 aq ⊇ y2 aq+1 ⊇ eα (Table C.1, Line 4, a-form), we see that

                 eα (x1 + a32   32            32     32            23     32

                              q+1 + Ak ) = eα (Aq+2 + Ak ). 

   5) Since eα ⊆ y3 A12        12
                     q+2 ⊆ y3 Aq+1 and y3 ⊇ eα , we see that

              eα (y2 y3 + A12   31               12     31            21        31

   6) Since a21             13        13
             q+2 = x2 + y1 aq+1 ⊇ y1 aq+1 ⊇ eα (Table C.1, Line 6, a-form), it follows that

                 eα (x3 + a21   21            21     21            12     21

    After all previous preparations the proof of Theorem 2.13.1 is rather trivial. Instead of
inclusion
                                 eαi ⊆ gα0 , where i = 1, 2, 3,
we will prove a sharper statement
      Proposition C.1.7. For the lattice elements eαi and gα0 , we have
                                       eαi = gα0 Z,     i = 1, 2, 3,
where the element Z for i = 1 is given in Table C.4.
   Proof of Proposition C.1.7 follows from the S-form of elements gα0 from Table C.3 and
the a-form and A-form of the elements eα1 from Table C.1. The polynomial gα0 from Table
C.3 is the intersection of M and P :
                                              gα0 = M ∩ P,                                          (C.1)

where M is the expression located on the left of the brackets in the S-form of Table C.1 and
P is the sum contained in the parantheses of this S-form. Then, for every line from Table
C.1, we have
                                  MZ = eα1 and eα1 ⊆ P.                                (C.2)
From (C.1) and (C.2) it follows that
                                 gα0 Z = MP Z = eα1 P = eα1 .
   For example, consider Lines 1 and 2 of Table C.4.
   Line 1. We have
                   gα0 = y2 A32   31 13 12    21   12

                   M = y2 A32   31 13 12

Since A12   12
       q ⊆ Aq−1 , it follows that

                                 MZ = y2 A32   31 13 12
                                          k−1 Aq Ak Aq = eα1

and by a-form from Table C.1 we obtain eα1 ⊆ a21
                                              q ⊆ P. 
   Line 2. We have
                   gα0 = y3 A13   23 21 12  12     13
                             k−1 Aq Ak Aq (Aq+1 + Ak ),

Since A12     12
       q+1 ⊆ Aq , we see that

                              MZ = y2 A32   31 13 12
                                       k−1 Aq Ak Aq+1 = eα1 .

    Proposition C.1.7 together with Theorem 2.13.1 (Inclusion Theorem) are proven.

                                   C.2. Properties of H + (n)
   C.2.1. The perfectness of ai (1). Without loss of generality we consider i = 1; we
have
                ρ(a1 (1)) =ρ(x2 (1) + x3 (1)) + ρ(y2 (2) + y3 (2)) =
                                          X
                           ρ(x2 + x3 ) +      ϕi Φ+ ρ(y2 (1) + y3 (1)) =
                                       X
                           X2 + X3 +        ϕi Φ+ ρ(y2 + y3 ).
    (a) Case Φ+ ρ(y2 + y3 ) 6= 0. In this case, ρ(a1 (1)) 6= 0. Since y2 +y3 is perfect (Proposition
2.9.3), we see that Φ+ ρ(y2 + y3 ) = X01 and by Corollary 2.4.4 we obtain
                                        X                          X
                ρ(a1 (1)) =X2 + X3 +         ϕi X01 = X2 + X3 +        ϕi Φ+ ρ(I) =
                                                                                              (C.3)
                           X2 + X3 + (Y1 + Y2 )(Y1 + Y3 )(Y2 + Y3 ).
If X2 + X3 = 0, then
                           ρ(a1 (1)) = (Y1 + Y2 )(Y1 + Y3 )(Y2 + Y3 )
and a1 (1) is perfect because yi + yj is perfect. If X2 + X3 6= 0 then Y2 + Y3 = X0 , and
therefore
                         ρ(a1 (1)) =X2 + X3 + (Y1 + Y2 )(Y1 + Y3 ) =
                                       (Y1 + Y2 + X3 )(Y1 + Y3 + X2 ) =                       (C.4)
                                       ρ((y1 + y2 + x3 )(y1 + y3 + x2 )).
Thus, a1 (1) is perfect by Corollary 2.9.4.
   (b) Case Φ+ ρ(y2 + y3 ) = 0. Here, we have Y21 + Y31 =0. Then Φ+ ρ is of the from
                                       X11 Y11 X01 0 0
                                               0
                                               0
      For any indecomposable representation Φ+ ρ, it can be true only for
                                                      
                                ρx0 or                 Φ−1 ρx0 or
                         +
                       Φ ρ=       ρy or     i.e., ρ =     Φ−1 ρy or                           (C.5)
                                1                      −1 1
                                  ρx1 ,                   Φ ρx1 ,
see Table A.1. For these 3 representations, ρ(x2 + x3 ) = 0, and therefore ρ(a1 (1))=0. 
    C.2.2. The perfectness of bi (1). To prove the perfectness of b1 (1) ⊇ a1 (1), it suffices
to consider only the representation ρ, for which ρ(a1 (1)) = 0, i.e., the case §C.2.1 (b). In
this case, ρ satisfies eq. (C.5). Since bi (1) = ai (1) + x1 (2), we get
                                ρ(b1 (1)) = ρ(a1 (1) + y3 y2 ) = Y3 Y2 .
                 −1
      Case ρ = Φ ρx0 (similarly, for Φ−1 ρy1 ). In this case, ρ is the direct sum
                      0 Y1 Y1 0 0                        0 0 Y2 Y2 0
                           0                  ⊕              Y2
                           0                                 0

where dim Y1 = dim Y2 = dim Y3 = 1, which contradicts the indecomposability of ρ.

   Case ρ = Φ−1 ρx1 . Then ρ(b1 (1)) = Y3 Y2 = R1 , i.e., ρ(b1 (1)) = X0 and b1 (1) is perfect. 

     C.2.3. The perfectness of ci (1). Since c1 (1) ⊇ b1 (1), we see as above, that it suffices
to consider only the case ρ(b1 (1)) = ρ(a1 (1)) = 0, i.e., again, ρ satisfies eq. (C.5). Since
ci (1) = ai (1) + y1 (2), it follows that
        ρ(c1 (1)) = ρ(ai (1) + y2 (x1 + y3 ) + y3 (x1 + y2 )) = Y2 (X1 + Y3 ) + Y3 (X1 + Y2 ).
For ρ = Φ−1 ρx0 and ρ = Φ−1 ρx1 , we have X1 = 0. Then
                               Y2 (X1 + Y3 ) + Y3 (X1 + Y2 ) = Y2 Y3
and we are back to the argumentation of §C.2.2. Let us consider ρ = Φ−1 ρy1 .
    Here, X1 + Y2 = X0 , otherwise dim(X1 + Y2 ) = 1 and X1 = Y2 and the representation
  −1
Φ ρy1 is decomposable. Since X1 + Y2 = X0 , we get Y3 (X1 + Y2 ) = Y3 ; by analogy we have
Y2 (X1 + Y3 ) = Y2 , and hence ρ(c1 (1)) = Y3 + Y2 . Since y2 + y3 is perfect, it follows that c1 (1)
is also a perfect element.
    The perfectness of elements ai (1), bi (1), ci (1) for i = 2, 3 is similarly proved. 

   C.2.4. The perfectness of ai (n), bi (n), ci (n). Now, we will prove the perfectness of
the elements ai (1), bi (1), ci (1).
   Proposition 3.1.1 1) For every element vi (n) = ai (n), bi (n), ci (n), we have
                                             X
                                 ρ(vi (n)) =   ϕk Φ+ ρ(vi (n − 1)).                 (C.6)
                                           k = 1, 2, 3

    2) The elements ai (n), bi (n), ci (n) are perfect for every n ≥ 1 and i = 1, 2, 3.
    Proof. 1) follows from the definition of the cumulative polynomials from §1.10, Proposi-
tion 2.13.3 and the definition of the perfect elements vi (n) from §A.6. 
    2) For n = 1, it was only just proved in §§ C.2.1, C.2.2, C.2.3. We will prove, for example,
the perfectness of a1 (n). From eq. (C.6) we have
                                             X
                             ρ(a1 (n)) =           ϕi Φ+ ρ(a1 (n − 1)).                    (C.7)
                                            i = 1, 2, 3

By (C.7), Proposition 2.10.1 and relation (2.15) we see that the perfectness of a1 (n) follows
from the perfectness of a1 (n − 1). 

    C.2.5. The distributivity of H + (n). Our proof of the following proposition is founded
on the well-known result of B. Jonsson [Jo55] (see Proposition A.4.4):
    A modular lattice generated by the chains s1 , s2 , s3 is distributive if and only if every
sublattice [v1 , v2 , v3 ], where vi is some element from si , is distributive.
   Proposition 3.1.2 H + (n) is distributive sublattices for every n ≥ 0.
   Proof. By Jonsson’s criterion it suffices to prove that
                                      vi vk + vj vk = (vi + vj )vk                                (C.8)
for distinct i, j, k. In our case, every two generators from different chains compose the same
sum
                                     vi + vj = In , where i 6= j.                         (C.9)
For n ≥ 1, we have
                                       X                    X
                               In =             xi (n) +             yi (n + 1).                 (C.10)

                                              vi vk + vj vk = vk                           (C.12)
for distinct i, j, k. We will omit index n in the polynomials ai (n), bi (n), ci (n).
    Suppose that
                                         ai aj + ak = In .                            (C.13)
Then, bi aj + ak = In and ci aj + ak = In . Further, by the modular law (A.3) we have
                                    ai = ai (ai aj + ak ) = ai aj + ai ak ,
                                    bi = bi (ai aj + ak ) = bi aj + bi ak ,                (C.14)
                                    ci = ci (ai aj + ak ) = ci aj + ci ak .
Now, if ai ⊆ vi , where vi = bi or ci , then
                        ai = ai aj + ai ak ⊆ ai vj + ai vk ⊆ ai (vj + ai vk ) ⊆ ai ,
i.e., ai = ai vj + ai vk . The same for bi , ci :
                                             ai = ai vj + ai vk ,
                                             bi = bi vj + bi vk ,                          (C.15)
                                             ci = ai vj + ci vk .
So, (C.15) and (C.12) follow from (C.13). Therefore, it suffices to prove (C.13). For n = 0
we have ai = yj + yk and
                In ⊇ ai aj + ak = (yj + yk )(yi + yk ) + yi + yj ⊇ yk + yi + yj = In .
Set
                                     ti (n) = xi (n) + yi (n + 1).                     (C.16)
Obviously, ai (n) = tj (n) + tk (n). By (C.10), for n ≥ 1, we have (parameter n is dropped)
                  In ⊇ ai aj + ak = (tj + tk )(ti + tk ) + ti + tj ⊇ tk + ti + tj = In .
      The distributivity of H + (n) is proven. 
   C.2.6. The cardinality of H + (n). Now we will prove that the distributive lattice
H (0) is a 27-element sublattice in D 2,2,2 and the distributive lattice H + (n)(n ≥ 1) is the
  +

64-element sublattice in D 2,2,2 .
   We introduce characteristic function χvρ to be
                                         (
                                          1 for ρ(v) = X0 ,
                                   χvρ =                                               (C.17)
                                          0 for ρ(v) = 0.
    Proposition 3.2.3 The lattice H + (0) contains 27 distinct elements.
    Proof. It suffices to enumerate all 27 elements in the lattice H + (0) and find representation
which separates each pair of elements. Table C.5 contains values of the characteristic function
(C.17) on 6 representations ρyi , ρxi , where i = 1, 2, 3 (see Table A.1), and all 27 elements of
H + (0). All signatures in Table C.5 are distinct. 
    Proposition 3.2.4 The lattice H + (1) contains 64 distinct elements.
    As above, for the sublattice H + (0), it suffices to enumerate all 64 elements in the lattice
H + (1) and find representation which separates each pair of elements. Tables C.6, C.7 contain

values of the characteristic function (C.17) on 9 representations ρxi , Φ−1 ρyi , Φ−1 ρxi , where
i = 1, 2, 3, (see Table A.1) and all 64 elements of H + (1).
    By (1.27) the generators ai , bi , ci , i = 1, 2, 3 from the sublattice H + (1) are:
       a1 (1) = x2 + x3 + y3 (x2 + y1 ) + y1 (x2 + y3 ) + y1 (x3 + y2 ) + y2 (x3 + y1 ),
       a2 (1) = x1 + x3 + y3 (x1 + y2 ) + y2 (x1 + y3 ) + y1 (x3 + y2 ) + y2 (x3 + y1 ),          (C.19)
       a3 (1) = x2 + x1 + y3 (x2 + y1 ) + y1 (x2 + y3 ) + y3 (x1 + y2 ) + y2 (x1 + y3 ),

              b1 (1) = a1 (1) + y2 y3 ,     c1 (1) = a1 (1) + y2 (x1 + y3 ) + y3 (x1 + y2 ),
              b2 (1) = a2 (1) + y1 y3 ,     c2 (1) = a2 (1) + y1 (x2 + y3 ) + y3 (x2 + y1 ),      (C.20)
              b3 (1) = a3 (1) + y1 y2 ,     c3 (1) = a3 (1) + y1 (x3 + y2 ) + y2 (x3 + y1 ),
see Table C.6. By (C.18) Lines 10 – 64 of Table C.7 are obtained by multiplying of appro-
priate Lines 1 – 9 of Table C.6.
    No two signatures in Tables C.6 coincide, which was to be proved.
   C.2.7. A relation between the upper and the lower generators of H + (n).

Proposition 3.5.1 Table 3.1 from §3.34 gives relations between the upper and the lower
generators. These relations are true mod θ.
    Proof. For definition of ai (n), bi (n), ci (n) (resp.      pi (n), qi (n), si (n)), see (1.27) (resp.
(3.34)).
    1) By (3.24) we have x0 (n + 2) ⊆ ai (n) and
                       sj (n) + sk (n) =
                       xj (n) + yj (n + 1) + xk (n) + yk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) =
                       ai (n) + x0 (n + 2) = ai (n).
   2) Here, we have
               sj (n) + sk (n) + pi (n) =
               ai (n) + pi (n) =
               xj (n) + yj (n + 1) + xk (n) + yk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) + xi (n + 1) =
               ai (n) + xi (n + 1) = bi (n).
   3) Further,
               sj (n) + sk (n) + qi (n) = ai (n) + qi (n) =
               xj (n) + yj (n + 1) + xk (n) + yk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) + yi (n + 1) =
               ai (n) + yi (n + 1) = ci (n).
   4) Consider the intersection ak (n)aj (n):
      ak (n)aj (n) =
      [xi (n) + yi (n + 1) + xj (n) + yj (n + 1)][xi (n) + yi (n + 1) + xk (n) + yk (n + 1)] =
      xi (n) + yi (n + 1) + (xj (n) + yj (n + 1))aj (n).
Since xj (n) + yj (n + 1) ⊆ ai (n)ak (n), we see that
                       ak (n)aj (n) ⊆ xi (n) + yi (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) =
                       xi (n) + yi (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = si (n).
140               C. THE INCLUSION THEOREM AND PROPERTIES OF H + (n)

On the other hand,
                       si (n) = xi (n) + yi (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) ⊆ aj (n)ak (n).
Therefore,
                                         si (n) = aj (n)ak (n).
      5) Since xi (n + 1) ⊆ aj (n) and xj (n + 1) ⊆ ai (n), by heading 4) we have
             bi (n)bj (n) = (ai (n) + xi (n + 1))(aj (n) + xj (n + 1)) =
             xi (n + 1) + xj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) =
             xi (n + 1) + xj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) + x0 (n + 2) = pi (n) + pj (n) + sk (n).
      6) Since yi (n + 1) ⊆ aj (n) and yj (n + 1) ⊆ ai (n), by heading 4) we get
             ci (n)cj (n) = (ai (n) + yi (n + 1))(aj (n) + yj (n + 1)) =
             yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) =
             yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) + x0 (n + 2) = qi (n) + qj (n) + sk (n).
      7) Since xi (n + 1) ⊆ bj (n), by heading 4) we see that
                ai (n)bj (n) = ai (n)(aj (n) + xj (n + 1)) = xj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) =
                xj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) + x0 (n + 2) = pj (n) + sk (n).
      8) Since yi (n + 1) ⊆ cj (n), by heading 4) we have
                ai (n)cj (n) = ai (n)(aj (n) + yj (n + 1)) = yj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) =
                yj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) + x0 (n + 2) = qj (n) + sk (n).
      9) Since xi (n + 1) ⊆ cj (n) and yj (n + 1) ⊆ bi (n), by heading 4) we have
             bi (n)cj (n) = (ai (n) + xi (n + 1))(aj (n) + yj (n + 1)) =
             xi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) =
             xi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n) + x0 (n + 2) = pj (n) + qj (n) + sk (n).
      10) Since xk (n + 1) ⊆ ai (n)aj (n), we see that
                  ai (n)aj (n)bk (n) = ai (n)aj (n)(ak (n) + xk (n + 1)) =
                  xk (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) = xk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = pk (n).
      11) Since yk (n + 1) ⊆ ai (n)aj (n), we have
                  ai (n)aj (n)ck (n) = ai (n)aj (n)(ak (n) + yk (n + 1)) =
                  yk (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) = yk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = qk (n).
      12) Here we have
                 bi (n)bj (n)ak (n) = (ai (n) + xi (n + 1))(aj (n) + xj (n + 1))ak (n) =
                 xi (n + 1) + xj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) =
                 xi (n + 1) + xj (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = pi (n) + pj (n).
      13) Further,
         bi (n)bj (n)ck (n) = (ai (n) + xi (n + 1))(aj (n) + xj (n + 1))(ak (n) + yk (n + 1)) =
         xi (n + 1) + xj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) =
         xi (n + 1) + xj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = pi (n) + pj (n) + qk (n).

14) As above,
   ci (n)cj (n)ak (n) = (ai (n) + yi (n + 1))(aj (n) + yj (n + 1))ak (n) =
   yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) = yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) =
   qi (n) + qj (n).
15) Similarly, we have
    ci (n)cj (n)bk (n) = (ai (n) + yi (n + 1))(aj (n) + yj (n + 1))(ak (n) + xk (n + 1)) =
    yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + xk (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) =
    yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + xk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = qi (n) + qj (n) + pk (n).
16) Similarly,
          ai (n)bj (n)ck (n) = ai (n)(aj (n) + xj (n + 1))(ak (n) + yk (n + 1)) =
           xj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) =
           xj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = pj (n) + qk (n).
17) It is just (3.24):
                               ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) = x0 (n + 2).
18) Here we have
   bi (n)bj (n)bk (n) = (ai (n) + xi (n + 1))(aj (n) + xj (n + 1))(ak (n) + xk (n + 1)) =
   xi (n + 1) + xj (n + 1) + xk (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) =
   xi (n + 1) + xj (n + 1) + xk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = pi (n) + pj (n) + pk (n).
19) Similarly,
    ci (n)cj (n)ck (n) = (ai (n) + yi (n + 1))(aj (n) + yj (n + 1))(ak (n) + yk (n + 1)) =
    yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1) + ai (n)aj (n)ak (n) =
    yi (n + 1) + yj (n + 1) + yk (n + 1) + x0 (n + 2) = qi (n) + qj (n) + qk (n).
20) As follows from Line 1) of this table,
      ai (n) + aj (n) = (sj (n) + sk (n)) + (si (n) + sk (n)) = si (n) + sj (n) + sk (n).
Proposition 3.5.1 is proven. 

                                      Conjectures
                                                   S
  1. Conjecture 1.13.2 The lattice H +                   H − contains all perfect elements of D 2,2,2
mod θ.
   For D 4 , the similar conjecture (due to Gelfand-Ponomarev) was proved by Dlab and
Ringel in [DR80] and Cylke in [Cyl82], see §1.3.
   2. Conjecture 3.4.4 The relation
                                              \
                            x0 (n + 2) =                 ai (n)   mod θ,
                                           i = 1, 2, 3

see (3.24, Proposition 3.4.2) takes place without restriction mod θ.
    Here, x0 (n + 2) is the cumulative polynomial defined in §1.10, and the ai (n) are perfect
elements defined in §1.27. The elements x0 (n + 2) are also perfect, see Corollary 3.4.3.
   3. Conjecture 3.9.2 The relation
                           ai (n)xi (n + 1) ⊆ yi (n + 2)           mod θ,
(see (3.51)), takes place without restriction mod θ.
    Here, xi (n + 1), yi (n + 2) are the cumulative polynomial defined in §1.10, and the ai (n)
are perfect elements defined in §1.27.
    4. Conjecture 4.8.6 For every admissible sequence α, the elements eα (resp. fα0 ) and
ẽα (resp. f˜α0 ) coincide without restriction mod θ (see Proposition 4.8.3).
    Here, the elements eα (resp. fα0 ) given by Table 4.3, and the elements ẽα (resp. f˜α0 )
determined by Gelfand and Ponomarev, see §4.8.2. For small admissible sequences, this
coincidence is proved in Propositions 4.8.4, 4.8.5.
