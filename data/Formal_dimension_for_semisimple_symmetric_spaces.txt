                                            (π, H) belonging to the holomorphic discrete series of H\G, then one can define a formal
                                            dimension d(π) in an analogous manner. In this paper we compute d(π) for these class of
                                            representations.

                                                  Let H\G be a semisimple irreducible simply connected non-compact symmetric space
                                            admitting relative holomorphic discrete series, i.e., there exists a unitary highest weight repre-
                                            sentation (πλ , Hλ ) of G and a non-zero H -invariant hyperfunction vector ν ∈ Hλ−ω such that
                                                                                          Z
                                                                     1           1
                                                                         :=                       |hν, πλ (g).vλ i|2 dµHZ\G (HZg)
                                                                    d(λ)    |hν, vλ i|2    HZ\G


                                            is finite. Here vλ denotes a highest weight vector, Z the center of G and µHZ\G a G-invariant
                                            measure on the homogeneous space HZ\G. Note that vλ and ν are unique up to scalar multiple
                                            as well as hν, vλ i 6= 0 . Therefore the number d(λ) is well defined and we call it the formal
                                            dimension of the spherical highest weight representation (πλ , Hλ ). We remark here that our
                                            definition of the formal dimension generalizes Harish-Chandra notion in the “group case”, i.e.,
                                            where G = G0 × G0 and H = ∆(G) = {(g, g): g ∈ G0 } for a simply connected hermitian Lie
                                            group G0 (cf. [HC56] and Remark III.5 below).

       Note that the constants d(λ) determine the part of the Plancherel measure on H\G which
corresponds to the relative holomorphic discrete series. Thus the explicit knowledge of the
formal dimensions gives us a better understanding of the Plancherel Theorem on H\G which
was recently obtained by van den Ban-Schlichtkrull and Delorme (cf. [BS97,99], [De98]).
       Let (g, τ ) be the symmetric Lie algebra attached to H\G and write g = h ⊕ q for the
τ -eigenspace decomposition. If g = k ⊕ p is a τ -invariant Cartan decomposition of g, then the
algebraic characterization of H\G admitting relative holomorphic discrete series is z(k) ∩ q 6= 0 .
Symmetric Lie algebras (g, τ ) having this property are called compactly causal (cf. [HiÓl96]). In
the group case, i.e., (g, τ ) = (g0 ⊕ g0 , σ) with σ(X, Y ) = (Y, X) the flip involution, this just
means that g0 is hermitian. We remark here that the formal dimension in the group case was
computed by Harish-Chandra (cf. [HC56]).
       In this paper we derive the formula for the formal dimension d(λ) for compactly causal
symmetric spaces. For the special class of Cayley type spaces this problem has been dealt with
by Chadli with Jordan algebra methods (cf. [Ch98]). The approach presented here is general and
purely representation theoretic.
       Our key result is the Averaging Theorem (cf. Theorem II.16) which asserts that for large
parameters λ the H -integral over vλ converges. More precisely, for large parameters λ we prove
that                          Z
                                                      hvλ , vλ i
                                  πλ (h).vλ dµH (h) =            c(λ + ρ)ν,
                                H                      hν, vλ i
where the left hand side has to be understood as a vector valued integral with values in the
Fréchet space of hyperfunction vectors and
                                       Z
                              c(λ) =              aH (n)−(λ+ρ) dµN (n)
                                       N ∩HAN


denotes the c-function of the non-compactly causal c-dual space H c \Gc (cf. [HiÓl96]).
     To obtain the formula for the formal degree d(λ), we plug in the relation for ν obtained
from the Averaging Theorem in the definition of d(λ) and obtain for large parameters:

                                       d(λ) = d(λ)G c(λ + ρ),
where d(λ)G is the formal dimension of (πλ , Hλ ) for the relative discrete series on G (cf. Theorem
III.6). Using some ideas of Ólafsson and Ørsted (cf. [ÓØ91]) we prove the analytic continuation
of our formula for d(λ) (cf. Theorem IV.15).
       The c-function c(λ) can be written as a product

                                           c(λ) = c0 (λ)cΩ (λ),

where c0 (λ) is the c-function of a certain Riemannian symmetric subspace of H\G and cΩ (λ)
is the c-function of the real form Ω of the bounded symmetric domain D ∼
                                                                       = G/K . In particular
we have

                                 d(λ) = d(λ)G c0 (λ + ρ)cΩ (λ + ρ).
The ingredients in this formula of d(λ) are known: Harish-Chandra computed d(λ)G in [HC56],
Gindikin and Karpelevič c0 (λ) (cf. [GiKa62]) and finally Ólafsson and the author computed
cΩ (λ) in [KrÓl99] (see also [Fa95], [Gr97] for earlier results in important special cases).
      In the final section we give applications of our results to spherical holomorphic repre-
sentation theory. Recall that a unitary highest weight representation (πλ , Hλ ) of G extends
naturally to a holomorphic representation of the maximal open complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup

Smax = G Exp(iWmax   ) (cf. [Ne99b, Sect. XI.2]). If (πλ , Hλ ) is an H -spherical unitary highest
weight representation of G, then we define its spherical character by

                                 0                  hvλ , vλ i

Note that Θλ is an H -biinvariant holomorphic function on Smax    . On the other hand on

(cf. Theorem V.4). Finally we want to point out that the results of this paper are a major step

                          I. Causal symmetric Lie algebras

      This subsection is a brief introduction to causal symmetric Lie algebras. Purely algebraic
definitions of “causality” are given and the basic notation on the algebraic level is introduced.

Definition I.1. Let g denote a finite dimensional Lie algebra over the real numbers.
(a) A symmetric Lie algebra is a pair (g, τ ), where τ is an involutive automorphism of g. We
set
                 h: = {X ∈ g: τ (X) = X} and q: = {X ∈ g: τ (X) = −X}
and note that g = h + q . We call (g, τ ) irreducible, if {0} and g are the only τ -invariant ideals
of g.
(b) We denote by gC the complexification of g. If τ is a involution on g, we also denote by τ
the complex linear extension of τ to a endomorphism of gC .
(c) The c-dual gc of (g, τ ) is defined by gc = h + iq .
(d) If g is semisimple, then there exists a Cartan involution θ of g which commutes with
τ (cf. [Be57] or [KrNe96, Prop. I.5(iii)]). We write g = k + p for the corresponding Cartan
decomposition. By subscripts we indicate intersections, for example hk = h ∩ k etc. Since τ
and θ commute, we have g = hk + hp + qk + qp . The prescription θc : = θτ |gc defines a Cartan
involution on gc and we denote by gc = kc + pc the corresponding Cartan decomposition of gc .
     If V ⊆ g is a subspace, then we set z(V ) = {X ∈ V : (∀Y ∈ V )[X, Y ] = 0} .
  4                                                                                      July 20, 1999

  Definition I.2. Let (g, τ ) be an irreducible semisimple symmetric Lie algebra and θ a Cartan
  involution of g commuting with τ . Then we call (g, τ )
 (CC) compactly causal if z(qk ) 6= {0} .
(NCC) non-compactly causal, if (gc , τ |gc ) is (CC).
 (CT) of Cayley type, if it is both (CC) and (NCC).

  Lemma I.3. Let (g, τ ) be a symmetric Lie algebra. Then the following assertions hold:
    (i) The symmetric Lie algebra (g, τ ) is compactly causal if and only if it belongs to one of the
        following two types:
          (1) The Lie algebra g is simple hermitian and z(k) ⊆ q .
          (2) The subalgebra h is simple hermitian and (g, τ ) ∼= (h ⊕ h, σ), where σ denotes the
               flip involution σ(X, Y ) = (Y, X).
   (ii) If (g, τ ) is compactly causal, then
          (a) z(k) ∩ q is one-dimensional,
          (b) every maximal abelian subspace b ⊆ qk is maximal abelian in q and hp + qk .
  Proof. (i) This follows from [HiÓl96, Lemma 1.3.5, Th. 1.3.8] or [KrNe96, Prop. V.6].
  (ii) This is a consequence of [HiÓl96, Prop. 3.1.11].

  Remark I.4. (a) From the view point of convex geometry and complex analysis the compactly
  causal symmetric spaces are the natural generalization of hermitian groups in the symmetric space
  setting (cf. [HiÓl96], [KrNe96], [KNÓ97, 98] and [Ne99b]). The compactly and non-compactly
  causal symmetric Lie algebras have been classified; for a complete list see [HiÓl96, Th. 3.2.8].
  (b) Suppose that H\G is a simply connected symmetric space associated to an irreducible
  semisimple symmetric Lie algebra (g, τ ). If (g, τ ) is compactly causal, then Lemma I.3(ii)(b)
  implies that the symmetric space H\G admits relative holomorphic discrete series (cf. [FJ80]).
  The converse is also true. This result seems to us to be well known. But since we do not know
  a proof in the literature, we added a proof in Appendix B (cf. Lemma B.1).
          Let (g, τ ) be compactly causal. Recall that this implies in particular that g is hermitian
  (cf. Lemma I.3(i)).
          We choose a maximal abelian subalgebra ia ⊆ qk and extend ia in k to a compactly
  embedded Cartan subalgebra t of g. Recall from Lemma I.3(ii)(b) that a is maximal abelian
  in iq and pc . Then t = th + ia and z(k) ∩ q ⊆ ia . By Lemma I.3 we know that z(k) ∩ q = RZ0
  is one-dimensional and by [Hel78, Ch. VIII, §7] we can normalize Z0 in such a way that
  Spec(ad Z0 ) = {−i, 0, i} holds. We denote by ∆      b = ∆(g
                                                             b C , tC ) the root system of gC with
  respect to tC and by ∆ = ∆(g , a) the restricted root system of gc with respect to a . Note that
                                   c

  ∆b |a \{0} = ∆. The corresponding root space decompositions are denoted by
                                     M                                  M
                        gC = t C ⊕         gb
                                            α
                                            C   and gc = a ⊕ zh (a) ⊕       (gc )α .
                                     b b
                                     α∈∆                                α∈∆


  A root α     b is called compact if α
           b ∈ ∆                       b(Z0 ) = 0 and non-compact otherwise. Analogously one
  defines compact and non-compact roots in ∆. Write ∆ b k and ∆b n for the set of all compact, resp.
  non-compact, roots in ∆b . Analogously one defines ∆k and ∆n .
                                                      b + of ∆
        Once and for all we fix now a positive system ∆      b such that

                               b +: = ∆
                               ∆      b+ ∩ ∆
                                           b n = {b b n: α
                                                  α∈∆    b(Z0 ) = i}
                                 n

                  II. Spherical highest weight representations

       In this section we briefly recall the classification of analytic and hyperfunction vectors of a
a unitary highest weight representation (πλ , Hλ ) of a simply connected compactly causal group
(G, τ ). Further we collect the basic facts of H -spherical highest weight representations. Then,
after giving the definitions of the various c-functions associated to the non-compactly causal
c-dual space (Gc , τ ) of (G, τ ), we prove the key result of the whole paper: The Averaging
Theorem, which asserts that for large parameters λ the H -integral over the highest weight
vector converges in the Fréchet space of hyperfunction vectors. One obtains the up to scalar
multiple uniquely determined H -spherical vector with a normalization constant which is given
by a certain c-function.



                             Unitary highest weight representations
        Recall that if G is a simply connected Lie group associated to a symmetric Lie algebra
(g, τ ), then τ integrates to an involution on G, also denoted by τ , and that the fixed point
group Gτ is connected (cf. [Lo69, Th. 3.4].)
        To a compactly causal symmetric Lie algebra (g, τ ) we associate the following analytic
objects:

                      G       simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra g,
                     Gc       simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra gc ,
                     GC       simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra gC ,
                      H       τ -fixed points in G,
                     Hc       τ -fixed points in Gc ,
                     HC       τ -fixed points in GC ,
                      K       analytic subgroup in G corresponding to k,
                     Kc       analytic subgroup in Gc corresponding to kc ,
                     KC       analytic subgroup in GC corresponding to kC ,
                     H0       centralizer of a in H,
                     H c,0    centralizer of a in H c ,
                      Z       center of G.

Note that even though both H and H c are connected and have the same Lie algebra, they are
in general not isomorphic. Recall that Z ⊆ K .
      If X is a topological space and Y ⊆ X is a subspace, then we denote by Y 0 or int Y the
interior of Y in X .
      For each X ∈ gC we denote by X the complex conjugate of X with respect to the real
form g.

Definition II.1.      (Complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups, cf. [Ne99, Ch. XI]) Let (g, τ ) be a
compactly causal symmetric Lie algebra and ∆  b+ = ∆  b + (gC , tC ) be the positive system from
Section I.
                  b + we define the maximal cone in t by
(a) Associated to ∆

                               bmax = {X ∈ t: (∀α ∈ ∆

We set Wcmax : = Ad(G).C bmax and note that W
                                            cmax is a closed convex Ad(G)-invariant convex
cone in g admitting no affine lines and which is maximal with respect to these properties (cf.
[Ne99b, Sect. VII.3]).
(b) Let G1 : = hexpGC (g)i. By Lawson’s Theorem Smax,1 : = G1 expGC (iWcmax ) is a closed sub-
semigroup of GC , the maximal complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup, and the polar map
                                cmax → Smax,1 , (g, X) 7→ g exp(iX)
                           G1 × W
is a homeomorphism (cf. [La94, Th. 3.4]).
                                                                                    cmax →
      Denote by Smax the universal covering semigroup of Smax,1 and write Exp: g + iW
Smax for the lifting of expGC | g+iW            c
                                   b max : g + iWmax → Smax,1 . Then it is easy to see that
Smax = G Exp(iWcmax ) and that there is a polar map

                                cmax → S, (g, X) 7→ g Exp(iX)
                              G×W

which is homeomorphism. We define the interior of Smax by Smax0             c 0 ). Note that
                                                                 : = G Exp(iW max
  0
Smax is an open semigroup ideal in Smax which carries a natural complex structure for which
the semigroup multiplication is holomorphic. Further the prescription s = g Exp(iX) 7→ s∗ =
Exp(iX)g −1 defines on Smax the structure of an involutive semigroup. Note that the involution
                       0
is antiholomorphic on Smax .

Remark II.2. Let (πλ , Hλ ) be a unitary highest weight representation of G with respect to
b + and highest weight λ ∈ it∗ . Denote by B(Hλ ) the C ∗ -algebra of bounded operators on
∆
Hλ . Recall from [Ne99b, Th. XI.4.8] that (πλ , Hλ ) has a natural extension to a holomorphic
representation πλ : Smax → B(Hλ ) of Smax , i.e., πλ is strongly continuous, holomorphic when
               0
restricted to Smax  and satisfies πλ (s∗ ) = πλ (s)∗ for all s ∈ Smax .
      Note that for X ∈ Wcmax one has πλ (Exp(iX)) = eidπλ (X) .


Definition II.3.      Let G be a Lie group and H a Hilbert space. If (π, H) is a unitary
representation of G, then we call v ∈ H an analytic vector if the orbit map G → H, g 7→ π(g).v
is analytic. We denote by Hω the vector space of all analytic vectors of (π, H). There is a natural
locally convex topology on Hω for which the representation (π ω , Hω ) of G on Hω is continuous
(cf. [KNÓ97, Appendix]). The strong antidual of Hω is denoted by H−ω and the elements of
H−ω are called hyperfunction vectors. Note that there is a natural chain of continuous inclusions
                                        Hω ֒→ H ֒→ H−ω .
The natural extension of (π, H) to a representation on the space of hyperfunction vectors is
denoted by (π −ω , H−ω ) and given explicitly by
                                 hπ −ω (g).ν, vi := hν, π ω (g −1 ).vi.
Proposition II.4. Let (πλ , Hλ ) be a unitary highest weight representation of G with respect
to ∆b + and highest weight λ. Let X ∈ int W
                                          cmax be an arbitrary element. Then the analytic
vectors of (πλ , Hλ ) are given by
                                           [
                                   Hλω =         πλ (Exp(tiX)).Hλ
                                           t>0

and the topology on Hλω is the finest locally convex topology making for all t > 0 the maps
Hλ → Hλω , v 7→ πλ (Exp(tiX)).v continuous.
Proof.    [KNÓ98, Prop. A.5].

                                          b + , we denote by (π K , F (λ)) the irreducible highest
      If λ ∈ it∗ is dominant integral for ∆ k                  λ
weight representation of K with highest weight λ. Note that (πλK , F (λ)) extends naturally to a
holomorphic representation of the universal covering group KfC of KC and which we denote by
the same symbol.

Remark II.5. Recall that (πλ , Hλ ) can be realized in the Fréchet space Hol(D, F (λ)) of F (λ)-
valued holomorphic functions on the Harish-Chandra realization D of the hermitian symmetric
space G/K . So let us assume Hλ ⊆ Hol(D, F (λ)). Then for all z ∈ D and v ∈ F (λ) the point
evaluation

                                      Hλ → C, f 7→ hf (z), vi
                                                         λ               λ
is continuous, hence can be written as hf (z), vi = hf, Kz,v i for some Kz,v ∈ Hλ . One can show
                  λ
that all vectors Kz,v are analytic. Then, if Hλ denotes the closure of Hλ in the nuclear Fréchet
space Hol(D, F (λ)), then the mapping

                   r: Hλ−ω → Hol(D, F (λ)), ν 7→ r(ν); hr(ν)(z), vi = ν(Kz,v
                                                                         λ
                                                                             )
is a G-equivariant topological isomorphism onto its closed image im r = Hλ . In particular Hλ−ω
is a nuclear Fréchet space (cf. [Kr99a, Sect. III] for all that).



                                   Spherical representations

Definition II.6.       Let G be a Lie group, H ⊆ G a closed subgroup and (π, H) a unitary
representation of G. Then we write (H−ω )H for the set of all those elements ν ∈ H−ω satisfying
π −ω (h).ν = ν for all h ∈ H . The unitary representation (π, H) is called H -spherical if there
exists a cyclic vector ν ∈ (H−ω )H for (π −ω , H−ω ).
                                                  b + recall the definition of the generalized
    For λ ∈ it∗ dominant integral with respect to ∆ k
Verma module

                                  N (λ): = U(gC ) ⊗U (kC ⋉p+ ) F (λ)
                                                      b + and highest weight λ (cf. [EHW83]).
which is a highest weight module of g with respect to ∆
We denote by L(λ) the unique irreducible quotient of N (λ).

Proposition II.7. Let (πλ , Hλ ) be a unitary highest weight representation of G with respect
to ∆b+.
   (i) If (πλ , Hλ ) is H -spherical, then (πλK , F (λ)) is H ∩ K -spherical. In particular λ ∈ a∗ and
       the highest weight vector vλ ∈ Hλ is fixed by H 0 .
  (ii) The restriction mapping
                                 Res: (H−ω )H → F (λ)H∩K , ν 7→ ν |F (λ)
      is injective. In particular, dim(H−ω )H ≤ 1 and hν, vλ i =  6 0 for ν 6= 0 . Moreover
      if L(λ) = N (λ), then Res is a bijection, i.e., (πλ , Hλ ) is H -spherical if and only if
      (πλK , F (λ)) is H ∩ K -spherical.
Proof.     (i) is a special case of [KNÓ97, Prop. VI.5] and (ii) a special case of [Kr99a, Th.
III.14].

Remark II.8. In general it is not true that (πλ , Hλ ) is H -spherical if the minimal K -type
(πλK , F (λ)) is H ∩ K -spherical. For a counter example see [Kr99a, Ex. III.16].

                                                                          k

Further we set                       M

Remark II.9. (a) The subalgebras p± and kC of gC are invariant under complex conjugation
with respect to gc and we have p± ∩ gc = n±                  c
                                          n as well as kC ∩ g = g(0). Thus the decomposition
       +         −                                      c
gC = p ⊕ kC ⊕ p induces a splitting in subalgebras of g
                                             gc = n +           −
                                                    n ⊕ g(0) ⊕ nn .

(b) Recall that gc = h ⊕ a ⊕ n. The h ⊕ a ⊕ n- decomposition restricted to g(0) coincides with an
Iwasawa decomposition of g(0) given by g(0) = k(0) ⊕ a ⊕ n+                              c
                                                           k , where k(0): = h ∩ g(0) = k ∩ g(0).

        We let HC ∩ KC act on HC × KC from the left by x.(h, k): = (hx−1 , xk) and denote by
                                         M : = HC ×HC ∩KC KC
the corresponding quotient space. The HC ∩ KC -coset of an element (h, k) ∈ KC × HC is denoted
              fC and K
by [h, k]. If H         fC denote the universal coverings of HC and KC , respectively, then we
                            f of M by
realize the universal cover M
                                        f=H

                ±            ±                          ±
Further let P : = expGC (p ). Recall that p are abelian and that the exponential mapping
expGC |p± : p± → P ± is an isomorphism. In particular P ± is simply connected.

Proposition II.10. (The HC KC P + -decomposition) The following assertions hold:
 (i) The multiplication mapping
                                     M × P + → GC , ([h, k], p+ ) 7→ hkp+
         is a biholomorphic map onto its open image HC KC P + . Furthermore:
            (a) The open submanifold HC KC P + is dense in GC with complement of Haar measure
                zero.
           (b) We have Smax,1 ⊆ HC KC P + .
    (ii) If j: Smax,1 → M × P + denotes the injection obtained from the isomorphism in (i), then j
         lifts to an inclusion mapping e         f× P+.
                                       j: Smax → M
Proof. (i) [KNÓ97, Prop. II.6, Lemma III.7].
(ii) Since π1 (Smax,1 ) = π1 (G1 ) ⊆ Z(G) ⊆ Z(K), it suffices to show that ej |K is injective. We
may assume that K ⊆ K      fC , since both K and K
                                                 fC are simply connected and k is a maximal
compact subalgebra of kC . Further K normalizes P + , and so establishing the injectivity of e j |K
                                            f
boils down to proving injectivity of K → M , k 7→ [1, k], which is obvious.
      We denote by G(0), A, N , N , Nk± and Nn± the analytic subgroups of Gc corresponding
to g(0), a , n, n, n±      ±
                    k and nn .

Remark II.11. (a) In view of the Bruhat decomposition of K    fC , we may identify AN + as a
                                                                                     k
            fC . Note that N = N + ⋊ Nn+ and so every n ∈ N can be written uniquely as
subgroup of K                    k
n = nk nn with nk ∈ Nk+ and nn ∈ Nn+ . Thus we conclude from Proposition II.10(ii) that the
map
                   H ×A×N →M    f × P + , (h, a, nk nn ) 7→ ([h, ank ], nn )
is an analytic diffeormphism onto its image which we denote by HAN . Accordingly every element
s ∈ HAN can be written uniquely as s = hH (s)aH (s)nH (s) with hH (s) ∈ H , aH (s) ∈ A and
nH (s) ∈ N all depending analytically on s ∈ HAN .
(b) If D ⊆ p+ denotes the Harish-Chandra realization of the hermitian symmetric space G/K
and D its conjugate in p− , then we set Ω: = D ∩ n− n . In the sequel we realize Ω as a subset of
Nn− via the exponential mapping. Recall from [KNÓ98, Lemma I.18] that
                       H c AN = ΩG(0)Nn+              and N ∩ H c AN = Ω ⋊ Nk− .
On the other hand Ω can also naturally be realized in M f × P + . In particular we obtain that
                         −
the submanifold Ω ⋊ Nk of N is naturally included in M   f × P + . Denote this realization by
                                                       c
N ∩ HAN . Further the HAN -decomposition and the H AN -decomposition (cf. [KNÓ97, Prop.
II.4]) coincide on N ∩ HAN . In the sequel we will use this fact frequently without mentioning
it.
(c) Let p: X → H c AN the universal covering of H c AN . Since X is simply connected, there
                                    f ×P + with π(X) = HAN . In particular, the prescription
exists a natural regular map π: X → M
                                K c ∩ HAN : = π(p−1 (K c ∩ H c AN ))
defines an open submanifold of HAN .
      Note that the exponential mapping expK  fC | a : a → A is an isomorphism, hence has an
inverse which we denote by log: A → a . For each λ ∈ a∗C and a ∈ A we set aλ = eλ(log a) .

Definition II.12. (The c-functions) We write ρ, ρk and ρn for the elements of a∗ given by

2 tr adn , 2 tr adnk and 2 tr adnn , respectively. To λ ∈ aC we associate the following c-functions:
                   +              +

                                        Z

and                                        Z
                               c0 (λ): =             aH (n)−(λ+ρk ) dµN − (n)

provided the integrals converge absolutely (cf. [FHÓ94] and [KNÓ98]). We write E for the set
of all λ ∈ a∗C for which the defining integral for c converges absolutely. Accordingly we define
EΩ and E0 . Note that c0 is the c-function of the non-compact Riemannian symmetric space
K(0)\G(0), where K(0): = G(0)τ .
      For each α ∈ ∆+ let α̌ ∈ a be the corresponding coroot, i.e., α̌ ∈ [(gc )α , (gc )τ α ] such that
α(α̌) = 2 . Associated to ∆+ we define two minimal cones in a by
                                                                          +
                  Cmin : = cone({α̌: α ∈ ∆+

Definition II.13. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space and V ∗ its dual.
(a) If C ⊆ V is a convex set, then its limit cone is defined by lim C = {x ∈ V : x + C ⊆ C} . Note
that lim C is a convex cone and that lim C is closed if C is open or closed.
(b) If E ⊆ V is a subset, then its dual cone is defined by E ⋆ : = {α ∈ V ∗ : α |V ≥ 0} . Note that
E ⋆ is a closed convex cone in V ∗ .

Theorem II.14.          The various c-functions are related by

                                             c(λ) = c0 (λ)cΩ (λ)

  (i) The domain of convergence EΩ of cΩ is a tube domain EΩ = ia∗ + EΩ,R with

        where mα : = dim(gc )α . Further for all λ ∈ EΩ we have

       (b) The function cΩ is holomorphic on EΩ and cΩ |EΩ +µ is bounded for all µ ∈ −ρ−Cmin .
 (ii) The domain of convergence of c0 is given by

                                                  E0 = ia∗ + int Čk⋆ ,

        c0 is holomorphic on E0 and c0 |E0 +µ is bounded for all µ ∈ ρk + Čk⋆ .
Proof.      The product formula c(λ) = c0 (λ)cΩ (λ) and the relation E = EΩ ∩ E0 are a special
case of [KNÓ98, Lemma IV.5].

(ii) All this follows from the Gindikin-Karpelevic product formula for c0 (cf. [Hel84, Ch. IV,

Lemma II.15. The group H 0 is compact and up to normalization of Haar measures for all
f ∈ L1 (H/H 0 ) the following integration formulas hold:
  (i)

                              0
                         f (hH ) dµH (h) =                    f (hH (k)H 0 )aH (k)−2ρ dµK c (k).
                     H                          K c ∩(HAN )

Proof. In [KNÓ98, Lemma III.15(i)] it is proved that H c,0 is compact and exactly the same
argument also yields that H 0 is compact. In view of this fact and our identifications of the various
domains in the big complex manifold M f × P + (cf. Remark II.11), (i) follows from [KNÓ98, Prop.
1.19] and (ii) from [Ól87, Lemma 1.3].

Theorem II.16.        (The Averaging Theorem) Let (πλ , Hλ ) be a unitary highest weight repre-
sentation of G for which (πλK , F (λ)) is H ∩ K -spherical. If vλ is a highest weight vector, then
the vector valued integral             Z
                                          πλ (h).vλ dµH (h)

with values in the Fréchet space       Hλ−ω
                                       (cf. Remark II.5) converges and defines a non-zero H -fixed
hyperfunction vector if and only if λ + ρ ∈ EΩ . If this condition is satisfied and 0 6= ν ∈ (Hλ−ω )H ,
then

                                       πλ (h).vλ dµH (h) =               c(λ + ρ)ν.

                                             0
Proof.     Step 1: The analytic function Smax    ∩ HAN → Hλ , s 7→ πλ (s).vλ extends to an
analytic function F : HAN → Hλ and is given ecplicitly by F (s) = aH (s)λ πλ (hH (s)).vλ .
     In fact since dπλ (X).vλ = 0 for all X ∈ n, the standard argument of differentiating yields

        πλ (s).vλ = πλ (hH (s)aH (s)nH (s)).vλ = πλ (hH (s)aH (s)).vλ = aH (s)λ πλ (hH (s)).vλ ,

establishing Step 1.
Step 2: The integral exists if and only if λ + ρ ∈ EΩ .
                  cmax be an arbitrary element and set at : = Exp(itX) for all t > 0 . For each
      Let X ∈ int W
t > 0 consider the possibly unbounded linear functional
                                           Z
                      ft : Hλ → C, w 7→       hπλ (h).vλ , πλ (at ).wi dµH (h).
                                                   H

In view of Proposition II.4, we have to show that λ + ρ ∈ EΩ is equivalent to ft ∈ Hλ′ for all
t > 0.
      Since vλ is fixed by H 0 (cf. Proposition II.7(i)), Step 1 and the integration formula of
Lemma II.15(ii) yield

                          K c ∩(HAN )


Recall from [FHÓ94, Prop. 5.3] that

                                          Z
(2.2)                  EΩ = {λ ∈ a∗C :                   aH (k)− Re(λ+ρ) dµK c (k) < ∞}.
                                           K c ∩(HAN )


      In view of [KNÓ98, Lemma III.15(ii)], the set Xt : = at (K c ∩ HAN ) is a compact subset of
                                            t     t    t
HAN . In particular we find compact sets CH   , CA  , CN  contained in H , A and N , respectively,
                   t t  t
such that Xt ⊆ CH CA CK . Thus we conclude from Step 1 that
12                                                                                            July 20, 1999




(2.3)          (∀w ∈ Hλ )(∀x ∈ Xt ) |hπλ (x).vλ , wi| ≤ supa∈C t aλ kvλ k · kwk < ∞.
                                                                    A


Hence, in view of (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) the proof of Step 2 will be complete, provided we can show
that for each element x in the compact space Xt we can find an open neighborhood U ⊆ Xt
of x and an element w ∈ Hλ such that inf y∈U |hπλ (y).vλ , wi| > 0 holds. But this follows from
hπλ (y).vλ , wi = hF (y), wi and the continuity of F .
Step 3: If the integral exists, then its value is hvhν,v λ ,vλ i
                                                             λi
                                                                 c(λ + ρ)ν .
      By Step 1 we know that λ + ρ ∈ EΩ in the case where the integral exists. Since λ is a
highest weight for an H ∩ K -spherical representation of K , it has to be dominant integral with
respect to ∆+  k , i.e., hλ, αi ∈ N0 for all
                                                          +
                                              R α ∈ ∆k . In particular−ω       c(λ + ρ) exists (cf. Theorem
II.14). Now by Step 2, we know that H          R π λ (h).v  λ  dµ  H (h) ∈ (Hλ  )H . Since dim(Hλ−ω )H ≤ 1
(cf. Proposition II.7(ii)), it follows that H πλ (h).vλ dµH (h) = cν for some constant c ∈ C. To
determine c we apply the integral to the element vλ . With Step 1 and the integration formula
of Lemma II.15(i) we compute
                        Z
                           hπλ (h).vλ , vλ i dµH (h)

                              Z
                           =              hπλ (hH (n)).vλ , vλ iaH (n)−2ρ dµN (n)
                               N ∩(HAN )
                              Z
                           =              hπλ (naH (n)−1 ).vλ , vλ iaH (n)−2ρ dµN (n)
                               N ∩(HAN )
                              Z
                           =              hπλ (n).vλ , vλ iaH (n)−(λ+2ρ) dµN (n)
                               N ∩(HAN )
                                        Z
                           = hvλ , vλ i            aH (n)−(λ+2ρ) dµN (n)
                                      N ∩(HAN )

                         = hvλ , vλ ic(λ + ρ).
This proves Step 3 and completes the proof of the theorem.



               III. Representations of the relative discrete series
      In this section we state and prove the Harish-Chandra - Godement Orthogonality relations
for homogeneous spaces carrying an invariant measure. Then we give the definition of the formal
dimension d(λ) of a unitary highest weight representation (πλ , Hλ ) which belongs to the relative
discrete series of H\G. Finally we derive the formula for d(λ) for large values of λ.

of Z .Let H ⊆ G be a closed subgroup. Suppose that HZ is closed and that HZ\G carries an
                                                   b we consider the Hilbert space of sections
invariant positive measure µHZ\G . For a fixed χ ∈ Z

        Γ2χ (H\G) = {f : H\G → C: f measurable, (∀z ∈ Z)(∀g ∈ G) f (Hzg) = χ(z)f (Hg);

Let (π, H) be an irreducible unitary H -spherical representation of G with central character χ.
Then for all ν ∈ (H−ω )H and v ∈ Hω we define a continuous section by
                              πv,ν : H\G → C, Hg 7→ hν, π(g).vi.
We say that (π, H) belongs to the relative discrete series of H\G, if there exists non-zero
elements ν ∈ (H−ω )H and v ∈ Hω such that πv,ν belongs to Γ2χ (H\G). We denote (H−ω )H   2
the subspace of (H−ω )H which corresponds to the relative discrete series for H\G.
       In the proof of the following Proposition we adapt a nice idea of J. Faraut to our setting
(cf. [Gr96, Sect. III.3]).

Proposition III.2. (Orthogonality Relations) Let G be a Lie group with center Z . Then, if
H is a closed subgroup of G such that HZ is closed and HZ\G carries a positive G-invariant
measure, then the following assertions hold:
 (i) If (π, H) belongs to the relative discrete series of H\G transforming under the central
     character χ ∈ Z b and 0 6= ν ∈ (H−ω )H , then all matrix coefficients πv,ν , v ∈ Hω , belong
                                           2
     to Γ2χ (H\G) and there exists a constant d(π, ν) depending on the equivalence class of π
     and on ν such that the mapping
                                                          p
                               T : Hω → Γ2χ (H\G), v 7→ d(π, ν)πv,ν
      extends to a G-equivariant isometry.
 (ii) If (π, H) and (σ, K) are two inequivalent representations of the relative discrete series of
      HZ\G transforming under the same central character for Z , then for ν ∈ (H−ω )H      2 and
      η ∈ (K−ω )H
                2 one has
                                     Z
                    hπv,ν , σw,η i =    hν, π(g).vihη, σ(g).wi dµHZ\G (HZg) = 0
                                    HZ\G
     for all v ∈ Hω and w ∈ Kω .
Proof.     (i) (cf. [Gr96, Sect. III.3]) Let D: = {v ∈ Hω : πv,ν ∈ Γ2χ (H\G)} and consider the
unbounded operator
                                  S: D → Γ2χ (H\G), v →7 πv,ν .
Since µHZ\G is G-invariant by assumption, the same holds for D and therefore D is dense in
H by the irreducibility of (π, H). We define a positive hermitian form on D by

(3.1)                             (v|w): = hv, wi + hS.v, S.wiχ
for v, w ∈ D . Denote by D the Hilbert completion of D with respect to (·|·) and denote the
extension of (·|·) to its completion by the same symbol. Since D is continuously embedded into
H , there exists a bounded selfadjoint injective operator A ∈ B(H) such that im A = D and
(A.v|w) = hv, wi for all v ∈ H , w ∈ D . Since h·, ·iχ is G-invariant by the G-invariance of
µHZ\G , it follows from (3.1) that A commutes with π(G). Now Schur’s Lemma applies and
yields A = c id for some constant c > 0 . Thus we deduce from (3.1) that
                                                    1    
                                    hS.v, S.wiχ =     − 1 hv, wi

                                                  
for all v, w ∈ D . In particular d(π, ν): = 1c − 1 > 0 . Moreover S being weakly continuous, its
extension to Hω coincides with √ 1 T , concluding the proof of (i).
                                   d(π,ν)
(ii) Let Tπ : H → Γ2χ (H\G)    and Tσ : K → Γ2χ (H\G) be the equivariant isometric embeddings
from (i). If im Tπ ∩ im Tσ 6= {0} , then
                                            Tσ∗ ◦ Tπ : H → K
describes a non-trivial G-equivariant map. By Schur’s Lemma Tσ∗ ◦ Tπ is a scalar multiple of an
isometric isomorphism, contradicting the inequivalence of (π, H) and (σ, K).

Remark III.3. If H\G is a semisimple symmetric space, then the space (H−ω )H       2 = (H
                                                                                           −∞
                                                                                              )2
is finite dimensional (cf. [Ba87, Th. 3.1]). Then Proposition III.2(i) says that one can find an
inner product on (H−ω )H  2 such that
                                                             p
                       (H−ω )H      ω      2

extends to a G-equivariant isometry (with G acting trivially on the first factor (H−ω )H
                                                                                       2 of the
tensor product).




                                       The formal dimension
     If G denotes a unimodular locally compact group and L ⊆ G a closed unimodular subgroup,
then we denote by µL\G a positive right G-invariant measure on the homogeneous space L\G.

Definition III.4. Let (πλ , Hλ ) be an H -spherical unitary highest weight representation of G
and 0 6= ν ∈ (Hλ−ω )H . If vλ is a highest weight vector for (πλ , Hλ ), then the formal dimension
d(λ) of (πλ , Hλ ) is defined by
                                          Z
                        1           1
                           :=                   |hν, πλ (g).vλ i|2 dµHZ\G (HZg).
                      d(λ)     |hν, vλ i|2 HZ\G
Recall that hν, vλ i 6= 0 and that the definition of d(λ) is independent of the particular choice of
vλ and 0 6= ν ∈ (Hλ−ω )H (cf. Proposition II.7(ii)).
     The relation between the number d(πλ , ν) from Proposition III.2 and d(λ) is given by
                   2
                                                                     |hν,vλ i|2
d(λ) = |hν,v  λ i|
         hvλ ,vλ i d(πλ , ν). In particular, if ν is normalized by hvλ ,vλ i = 1 , then we have
d(λ) = d(πλ , ν).

Remark III.5. The particular normalization of d(λ) as in Definition III.4 is motivated from
Harish-Chandra’s treatment of the “group case” (cf. [HC56]). The group case is defined by
G = G0 × G0 and H = ∆(G) = {(g, g): g ∈ G0 } for a simply connected hermitian Lie group G0 .
Then we have a natural isomorphism

                                      G0 → H\G, g 7→ H(g, 1)

and the invariant measure µZH\G corresponds to a Haar measure µZ(G0 )\G0 on Z(G0 )\G0 .
      The spherical unitary highest weight representations of G are given by (πλ ⊗ πλ∗ , Hλ ⊗H  b λ∗ )
                                                                       ∗   ∗
with (πλ , Hλ ) a unitary highest weight representation of G0 and (πλ , Hλ ) its dual representation.
Recall that Hλ ⊗Hb λ∗ is isomorphic to the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators B2 (Hλ ) on Hλ and
that the corresponding analytic vectors are of trace class, i.e., B2 (Hλ )ω ⊆ B1 (Hλ ) (cf. [HiKr99a,
App.]). The up to scalar unique H -fixed hyperfunction vector is given by the conjugate trace:

                                    ν: B2 (Hλ )ω → C, A 7→ tr(A).

Further a highest weight vector for (πλ ⊗ πλ∗ , Hλ ⊗H  b λ∗ ) is given by vλ ⊗ vλ∗ . Then hν, vλ ⊗ vλ∗ i =
hvλ , vλ i and the expression for d(λ) from Definition III.4 gives that
                                         Z
                     1            1
                         =                          |hπλ (g).vλ , vλ i|2 dµZ(G0 )\G0 (Zg).
                    d(λ)    |hvλ , vλ i|2 Z(G0 )\G0

Thus we see that our definition of the formal dimension coincides in the group case with the
standard one introduced by Harish-Chandra (cf. [HC56]).

Theorem III.6.       Let (πλ , Hλ ) be an unitary highest weight representations of G for which
(πλK , F (λ)) is H ∩ K -spherical. Assume that λ + ρ ∈ EΩ and that (πλ , Hλ ) belongs to the
holomorphic discrete series of G. Then (πλ , Hλ ) is H -spherical, belongs to the relative discrete
series of H\G and the formal degree d(λ) is given by

                                           d(λ) = d(λ)G c(λ + ρ),

where d(λ)G is the formal dimension of (πλ , Hλ ) relative to G.
Proof.     Since λ + ρ ∈ EΩ the asumptions of Theorem II.16 are satisfied and the theorem
applies. Thus (πλ , Hλ ) is H -spherical and if 0 6= ν ∈ (Hλ−ω )H and vλ is a highest weight vector,
then we have

                                                          Z
                                           hν, vλ i

                                     hvλ , vλ ic(λ + ρ)   H

If we insert (3.2) in the formula for ν in the definition of the formal dimension we obtain that

Thus if we apply the Harish-Chandra-Godement Orthogonality Relations for L2 (Z\G) and once

                            IV. Analytic continuation in λ

      In this section we prove the analytic continuation of the formula for the formal dimension
d(λ) from Theorem III.6. The proof is quite technical and we need some preparation on algebraic
and analytic level.



                                    Algebraic preliminaries
     In this subsection we collect some facts concerning the fine structure theory of compactly
causal symmetric Lie algebras. The results are mainly due to Ólafsson (cf. [Ól91]).

Lemma IV.1. Let (g, τ ) be a compactly causal symmetric Lie algebra, then we can choose root
vectors Eα ∈ gα         b
                C , α ∈ ∆n , such that the following conditions are satisfied:
  (1) Eα = E−α .
  (2) α(Hα ) = 2 with Hα = [Eα , E−α ].
  (3) τ (Eα ) = Eτ α , where τ α = τ ◦ α .
Proof. Let κ denote the Cartan-Killing form on gC and define a hermitian inner product on
gC by hX, Y i: = −κ(X, θ(Y )).
      For each α ∈ ∆ b + let 0 6= Eα ∈ gα be an arbitrary element of length 1 . Then define E−α by
                       n                C
E−α : = Eα . Thus (1) is satisfied. Now τ (Eα ) ⊆ CEτ α implies the existence of complex numbers
cα such that τ (Eα ) = cα Eτ α . Now τ being an involutive implies cα cτ α = 1 , further τ being
an isometry implies that |cα | = 1 and finally τ being complex linear implies that cα = c−α for
        b n . Thus cτ α = cα = c−α . For each complex number z = eiϕ , ϕ ∈ [0, 2π[, of modulus
all α ∈ ∆
                       ϕ
               1
1 we define z 2 = ei 2 . Thus redifining Eα , α ∈ ∆  b + , by cα 21 Eα , leaves (1) untouched and in
                                                       n
addition satisfies (3).
      Since gα                     b+
              C ⊆ pC for all α ∈ ∆n , we have α([Eα , E−α ]) > 0 , and so by rescaling Eα with an
appropriate positive number we may in addition assume that (2) holds. This proves the lemma.

      Let Γb = {b            br } be a maximal system of strongly orthogonal, i.e., b
                γ1 , . . . , γ                                                           bi is never a

Lemma IV.2. The Cayley transform C has the following properties:
   (i) For all 1 ≤ j ≤ r one has C(X  bj ) = Hb j and C(Hb j ) = −X
                                                                  bj .

        (b) θ ◦ C = C −1 ◦ θ ,
 (iii) The Cayley transform yields an isomorphism C: e → C(e) with C(e) ⊆ it a τ -invariant
       subspace.
Proof. (i) This follows from sl(2, R)-reduction (cf. [HC56, p. 584], [HiÓl96, Lemma A.3.2(3)]).

Thus i π4 ( rj=1 E
(iii) This follows from (i) and (ii)(a).
      Recall that e is τ -invariant and write b = e ∩ q for the set of −τ -fixed points.

Lemma IV.3.          Let c: = C(b). Then c ⊆ a and the Cayley transform yields an isomorphism
C: b → c.
Proof. Since C(b) ⊆ it by Lemma IV.2(i), the fact that b ⊆ q and that C commutes with τ
(cf. Lemma IV.2(ii)) imply that C(b) ⊆ i(t ∩ q). But i(t ∩ q) = a by the definition of a , proving
the lemma.
       Recall that b is maximal abelian subspace of q∩p (this follows for instance from the c-dual
version of Lemma 4.1.9 in [HiÓl96]) and denote by Σ = Σ(g, b) the set of roots of g with respect
to b . Recall that Σ is an abstract root system (cf. [Sch84, Sect. 7.2]). We write
                                                          M
                                           g = zg (b) ⊕         gϕ
                                                          ϕ∈Σ

for the corresponding root space decomposition. By Lemma IV.3, the Cayley transform induces
a mapping C t : a∗ → b∗ , α 7→ α ◦ C |b and we set

                             Σn = C t (∆n ) |b   and Σk = C t (∆k ) |b \{0}.

Let Γ = { 12 (b     bj ): 1 ≤ j ≤ r} denote the restricted set of strongly orthogonal roots. Note that
              γj −τ γ
Γ ⊆ c∗ by Lemma IV.2(i). Thus we can write Γ = {γ1 , . . . , γs } for some 1 ≤ s ≤ r . For each
1 ≤ j ≤ s we define Hj ∈ c by γj (Hj ) = 2 and γk (Hj ) = 0 for k 6= j . We set Xj : = −C(Hj )
for all 1 ≤ j ≤ s. Then
                                                  Ms
                                             b=       RXj .
                                                   j=1

As a final algebraic tool we need explicit information on the root system Σ which is provided by
Ólafsson’s Theorem on double restricted root systems (cf. [Ól91, Sect. 3], [HÓØ91, Prop. 3.1]).
For all 1 ≤ j ≤ s we set ψj : = C t (γj ) and note that ψj (Xj ) = 2 since C(Xj ) = Hj (cf. Lemma
IV.2(i), (ii)).
       Finally we put Σ+ : = C t (∆+ ) |b \{0} , Σ+
                                                  n : = Σn ∩ Σ

Theorem IV.4.        (Ólafsson) If (g, τ ) is compactly causal, then the following assertions con-
cerning the double restricted root system Σ = Σ(g, b) hold:
  (i) The restricted root system has the following form
                                     1                        1

        and
                                  1                             1
                            Σ+
                             n = { (ψi + ψj ): 1 ≤ i, j ≤ s} ∪ { ψj : 1 ≤ j ≤ s}.
                                  2                             2
        The second sets in Σk and Σ+                           4
                                   n are empty if and only if C = id. If further ψs is chosen
        to be a simple root, then
                                     1                       1

 (ii) All ψj , 1 ≤ j ≤ s, have the same length.
(iii) The conjugacy classes of the restricted root system under the Weyl group associated to Σ
      are given by
        (1) {± 21 (ψi ± ψj ): 1 ≤ i, j ≤ s, i 6= j}
        (2) {±ψj : 1 ≤ j ≤ s}
        (3) {± 21 ψj : 1 ≤ j ≤ s}
Proof. (i) Let Σ    b = Σ(g,
                        b e) be the restricted root system with respect to the maximal abelian
subspace e and Σk , Σn defined as above. Write ψbj : = C t (b
                  b    b                                      γj ) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ r . Suppose first
that g is simple. Then for the analogous statement for Σ   b in stead of Σ and ψbj in stead of ψj ,
Harish-Chandra has proved in [HC56, Lemma 13-16] that Σ       b k, Σ
                                                                   b + are contained in the asserted
                                                                     n
subsets, Moore proved equality (cf. [Mo64, Th. 2]) and finally Korányi and Wolf have shown in
[KoWo65, Prop. 4.4 with Remark] that the second set in Σ     b + is empty if and only if C 4 = id .
                                                               n
Now taking restrictions to c yields (i) for g simple.
       In the group case similar considerations lead to the same result.
(ii) This can be deduced from [Mo64, Th. 2(2)], but we propose here a much simpler proof. We
use (i) and the fact that Σ is an abstract root system. As usual we write sψ , ψ ∈ Σ, for the
reflection associated to ψ . Then we obtain for all 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ s that

                                                   2hψj , 21 (ψi + ψj )i     1
                     s 21 (ψi +ψj ) (ψj ) = ψj −1              1               (ψi + ψj )
                                              h 2 (ψi + ψj ), 2 (ψi + ψj )i 2
                                                    2hψj , ψj i
                                       = ψj −                         (ψi + ψj ).
                                              hψi , ψi i + hψj , ψj i
                                                                    hψj ,ψj i
Thus it follows from (i) and s 12 (ψi +ψj ) (ψj ) ∈ Σ that     hψi ,ψi i+hψj ,ψj i   ∈ { 21 , 14 } . Interchanging i
                         hψ ,ψ i
                           j j
and j then yields hψi ,ψi i+hψ j ,ψj i
                                       = 21 or equivalently that hψj , ψj i = hψi , ψi i. This proves (ii).
(iii) In view of (i), we have for all 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ r that

                                s 12 (ψi ±ψj ) (ψj ) = ∓ψi ,
                                             1            1
(4.1)                           s 21 (ψi ±ψj ) (ψj ± ψk ) = (∓ψi ± ψk ),

                                sψi     (ψi ± ψj ) = (−ψi ± ψj ).
                                      2               2
This proves (iii).

        From now on we assume that ψs is a simple root. Then Theorem IV.4(i) says that
                             1                             1

                        n = { (ψi + ψj ): 1 ≤ i, j ≤ s} ∪ { ψj : 1 ≤ j ≤ s}.
                             2                             2
        and
                            1                              1
(4.3)                 Σ+
                       k = { (ψi − ψj ): 1 ≤ i < j ≤ s} ∪ { ψj : 1 ≤ j ≤ s}.
                            2                              2
Further it follows from Theorem IV.4(i) and the first formula in (4.1) that the Weyl group W(Σk )
of Σk acts on b as the full permutation group of the Xj ’s.
     We write b+ = {X ∈ b: (∀ϕ ∈ Σ+ ) ϕ(X) ≥ 0} for the Weyl chamber corresponding to Σ+ .
By (4.2) and (4.3) we then have
                                        s
                                        X
                               b+ = {         xj Xj : 0 ≤ xs ≤ . . . ≤ x1 }.
                                        j=1

Further let a+ : = {X ∈ a : (∀α ∈ ∆+ ) α(X) ≥ 0} and c+ : = a+ ∩ c. Note that C(b+ ) = c+ by
the construction of Σ+ .

Lemma IV.5. The following equality holds
                                   ⋆
                                  Cmin ∩ (−Čk⋆ ) = (c+ )⋆ ∩ (−Čk⋆ ),
where the stars ⋆ are all taken in a∗ .
Proof. First recall some basic rules in dealing with convex cones (cf. [Ne99b, Ch. V]). If W is
a closed convex cone in an euclidean space V , then (W ⋆ )⋆ = W . Further for two closed convex
cones W1 , W2 ⊆ V we have (W1 ∩ W2 )⋆ = W1⋆ + W2⋆ .
      Let now the convex cone on the left hand side be denoted by W1 , the other one by W2 . Let
p: a → c be the orthogonal projection with respect to the Cartan-Killing form. We claim that
p(W1⋆ ) = p(W2⋆ ). Assume first that no half roots in Σ occur. Then from the Cayley-transform
analogs of (4.2) and (4.3) it follows that
                                                  s
                                                  M                s−1
                                                                   M
                    p(W1⋆ ) = p(Cmin − Čk ) =          R + Hj +         R+ (Hj+1 − Hj ),
                                                  j=1              j=1

and
                               M
                                s
                                               s
                                                X                           Ms−1
   p(W2⋆ ) = p(c+ − Čk ) =          R + Hj ∩ {   xj Hj : xs ≤ . . . ≤ x1 } +     R+ (Hj+1 − Hj ).
                               j=1                j=1                               j=1

From these two equalities the claim follows in the case of no half roots in Σ. The general case is
easily deduced from this.
      Let r: a∗ → c∗ , r(λ): = λ |c be the restriction map and note that r is the dual map of the
                                                                             ⋆ ⋆
inclusion mapping c → a . Since both W1 and W2 are closed, we have (W1,2       ) = W1,2 , and so
                                                           ⋆
                                  W1,2 |c = r(W1,2 ) = (p(W1,2 ))⋆ .

Hence our claim implies that W1 |c = W2 |c . Thus W1 ⊆ W2 by the definition of W1 and W2 .
       For the converse inclusion we first note that an element λ ∈ −Čk⋆ belongs to W1 if and only
if λ(β̌) ≥ 0 , where β is the highest root (this becomes clear from our construction of the positive
systems). Recall that Γ b can be constructed inductively starting with the highest root (cf. [HC56,
p. 108]). Thus β = γ1 inΓ. Hence W1 = (γ1 )⋆ ∩ −Čk⋆ , and so W2 ⊆ W1 since (c+ )⋆ ⊆ (γ1 )⋆ .

     Recall the definition of b+ and set B + : = exp(b+ ).

Lemma IV.6. (Flensted-Jensen) Let L = ZH∩K (b). Then for the homegeneous space HZ\G
the following assertions hold:
   (i) The subgroups HZ and LZ of G are closed and Z\LZ is compact.
  (ii) The mapping
                             Φ: B + × LZ\K → HZ\G, (b, LZk) →
                                                            7 LZbk
      is a diffeomorphism onto its open image. The image is dense with complement of Haar
      measure zero.
(iii) Up to normalization of measures we have for all f ∈ L1 (HZ\G) the following integration
      formula

                  f (HZg) dµHZ\G (HZg) =            f (HZ exp(X)k) J(X) dX dµZ\K (Zk)

        where m±                 ϕ
                 ϕ : = dim({X ∈ g : θτ (X) = ±X}).
Proof. (i) The closedness of HZ and LZ follows from the closedness of Ad(H) and ZAd(H) (b)
in the adjoint group Ad(G). Finally Z\LZ is a closed subgroup of the compact group Z\Z(H ∩
K) and hence compact.
(ii) [Sch84, Prop. 7.1.3].
(iii) It follows from [FJ80, Th. 2.6] or [Sch84, Lemma 8.1.2] that

for all X ∈ b+ and k ∈ K . Thus it follows from (ii) that

                f (HZg) dµHZ\G (HZg) =                   f (HZ exp(X)k) J(X) dX dµLZ\K (Zk)
         HZ\G                            LZ\K       b+

holds for all f ∈ L1 (HZ\G). In view of (i), we may replace the integration over LZ\K by an
Z\K -integral, proving (iii).

Lemma IV.7.     Realize G as a submanifold of M  f × P + as in Proposition II.10(ii). Then for

(ii) Recall that X = sj=1 xj Xj ∈ b+ if and only if 0 ≤ xs ≤ . . . ≤ x1 . Now the assertion
follows from (i) and the monotonicity of the mapping R+ → R, x 7→ log cosh(x).

                             Proof of the analytic continuation
      Let (πλ , Hλ ) be an H -spherical unitary highest weight representation of G. Further let
ν ∈ (Hλ−ω )H an H -fixed hyperfunction vector and ν0 = ν |F (λ) ∈ F (λ)H∩K . We normalize ν by
setting kν0 k = 1 and then vλ by |hν, vλ i| = 1 . Then we have
                                              Z

Definition IV.8. On the non-compactly Riemannian symmetric space K(0)\G(0) we define
the spherical function with parameter λ ∈ a∗C by

                              ϕ0λ (g) =     aH (gk)λ−ρk dµK(0) (k),

for all g ∈ G(0).

Remark IV.9. Note that if λ ∈ a∗ is the highest weight of an H ∩ K -spherical representation
                 fC , then ϕ0

                            λ+ρk extends to a holomorphic function on KC and we have

Proposition IV.10.       With the notation of Lemma IV.7 we have
                                       Z
                                 1

where J(X) is given as in Proposition IV.6(iii).
Proof.      (cf. [HC56, p. 599], [Gr96, Prop. 10]) In the sequel we identify b with B via the
exponential mapping and for b = expG (X) ∈ B + we set J(b): = J(X). Then by Lemma

In view of Lemma II.10(ii), we can write each element in b ∈ B + as ([hC (b), µ(b)], p+ (b)) ∈

M                        fC . Now the same consideration as in the proof of Step 1 of Theorem II.16

yields for all b ∈ B and k ∈ K that
                                                                   

If we insert this expression for the matrix coefficient in (4.5), use Schur’s Orthogonality Relations
for (πλK , F (λ)) and the relation πλK (µ(b))∗ = πλK (µ(b)) (cf. Lemma IV.7), we arrive at

                            dim F (λ) B + λ
Now the assertion of the proposition follows from (4.4).

Lemma IV.11. Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space, W ⊆ V be an open convex
cone, α1 , . . . , αn , β1 , . . . , βm ∈ W ⋆ \{0} and p1 , . . . , pn , q1 . . . , qm ∈ N0 . For every λ ∈ V ∗ we
define the integral

                                             Y                       m
                                                                     Y                qj
                    H(λ): =          eλ(x)         (sinh αj (x))pj         cosh βj (x)    dµV (x).
                                 W           j=1                     j=1
                                                      Pn                Pm
Then H(λ) converges if and only if λ +                  j=1   pj αj +      j=1 qj βj   ∈ − int W ⋆ .
Proof.     If q1 = . . . = qm = 0 , then this is Lemma IV.6 in [Kr98]. The general case is easily
obtained from this.
       The following characterization of the relative discrete series by the parameter λ is due to
Hilgert, Ólafsson and Ørsted and was obtained in two steps (cf. [ÓØ91, Th. 5.2], [HÓØ91, Th.
3.3]). We present an essentially modified proof here, but we point out that it is not our objective
to give new proofs of well-known facts. In the course of our arguments we obtain an important
new estimate which is crucial for the analytic continuation of I(λ).

Theorem IV.12. (Hilgert-Ólafsson-Ørsted) Let (πλ , Hλ ) be an unitary highest weight repre-
sentation of G with (πλK , F (λ)) being H ∩ K -spherical. Then (πλ , Hλ ) belongs to the relative
discrete series of H\G if and only if the condition

(RDS)                                        (∀α ∈ ∆+
                                                    n)        hλ + ρ, αi < 0

is satisfied.
Proof.      Recall the definition of c+ , a+ and the relation C(b+ ) = c+ . Set A+ : = expGc (a+ )
and let k · k denote an arbitrary norm on a . If we write (c+ )⋆ , then the star ⋆ is to be taken in
a∗ .
Step 1: I(λ) < ∞, if λ + ρ ∈ − int(c+ )⋆ , the interior of (c+ )⋆ .
      Here we do not assume that λ ∈ a∗ is dominant integral with respect to ∆+         k , but only
λ ∈ Čk⋆ . By Harish-Chandra’s estimates for spherical functions on non-compact Riemannian
symmetric spaces, there exists constants c > 0 and d ∈ N such that


(4.6)                     (∀λ ∈ Čk⋆ )(∀a ∈ A+ )           ϕ0λ (a) ≤ caλ−ρk (1 + k log ak)d

(cf. [Wal88, 4.5.3]). Note that J(X) ≤ e2ρ(C(X)) for all X ∈P
                                                            b+ by the formula for the Jacobian
                                                             s
in Lemma IV.6(iii). Thus it follows for all λ ∈ Čk and X = j=1 xj Xj ∈ b+ from (4.6) together
                                                  ⋆

with Lemma IV.7 that
            ϕ0λ+ρk (µ(expG (X))2 ) J(X) ≤ cµ(expG (X))2λ (1 + k log µ(expG (X))2 k)d e2ρ(C(X))
(4.7)                                          ≤ ce2λ(C(X)) (1 + 2kC(X)k)d e2ρ(C(X))
                                               ≤ ce2(λ+ρ)(C(X)) (1 + 2kC(X)k)d .

Now Proposition IV.11 shows that I(λ) < ∞ if λ + ρ ∈ − int(c+ )⋆ , proving our first step.
Step 2: λ + ρ ∈ − int(c+ )⋆ , if I(λ) < ∞.
      Recall that λ is supposed to be dominant integral with respect to ∆+  k . Thus it follows
from (4.4) and the fact that the H ∩ K -spherical vector ν0 has a non-zero vλ -component (cf.
[Hel84, p. 537, (7)]) that there is a constant cλ > 0 such that cλ aλ ≤ ϕ0λ+ρk (a) holds for all
a ∈ A+ . Hence Lemma IV.7 implies that
                                  cλ 2λ(C(X))
                   (∀X ∈ b+ )        e        J(X) ≤ ϕ0λ+ρk (µ(expG (X))2 )J(X).
                                   2
In view of Proposition IV.10 and Lemma IV.11, we obtain λ + ρ ∈ − int(c+ )⋆ if I(λ) < ∞. This
proves our second step.
Step 3: If λ ∈ Čk⋆ , then λ satisfies (RDS) if and only if λ + ρ ∈ − int(c+ )⋆ .
                                                                      ⋆
      Note that λ satisfies (RDS) means that λ + ρ ∈ − int Cmin          . Now if λ ∈ Čk⋆ , then
              ⋆
λ + ρ ∈ int Čk . Thus Step 3 follows from Lemma IV.5.
      In view of Steps 1-3, it follows that I(λ) is finite if and only if λ satisfies the condition
(RDS). The proof of the theorem will therefore be complete with
Step 4: If λ satisfies (RDS), then (πλ , Hλ ) is H -spherical.
      Let κ: G → K    fC /(K
                           fC ∩ HfC )0 the canonical projection defined via the decomposition in
Proposition II.10. Now the function
                                H\G → C, Hg 7→ hπλK (κ(g)).vλ , ν0 i
generates an H -spherical module in the relative discrete series on H\G (cf. [ÓØ91, Th. 5.2]).
This proves Step 4 and concludes the proof of the theorem.
        The prescription
                                              ⋆
                                 W : = − int Cmin ∩ Čk⋆ ⊆ − int(c+ )⋆
defines a convex cone in a∗ . We write TW = ia∗ + W for the associated tube domain in a∗C .
Note that ρn ∈ iz(k)∗ by the construction of ∆+
                                              n and so −ρn ∈ W .

Lemma IV.13. The function I(λ) extends naturally to a continuous function on the affine
subtube TW − ρ, also denoted by I , and which is holomorphic when restricted to TW 0 − ρ. If
m ∈ N is sufficiently large, then W − mρn ⊆ W − ρ and I |TW −mρn is bounded.
                                                                                             ⋆
Proof. First we show that W − mρn ⊆ W − ρ for large values of m ∈ N. Since ρn ∈ int Cmin        ,
                            ⋆                                                            ∗
we have ρ − mρn ∈ − int Cmin provided m ∈ N is sufficiently large. Further ρn ∈ iz(k) shows
that R.ρn ∈ Čk⋆ . Thus we have ρ − mρn ∈ W if m is chosen sufficiently large, proving our claim.
     Recall the formula for I(λ) from Proposition IV.10. Then (4.7) yields constants c > 0 ,
d ∈ N such that

In particular, we see that λ 7→ dim 1F (λ) extends to a holomorphic map on TW and TW − ρ which
is bounded when restricted to TW − mρn for all m ∈ N0 . Further for each fixed b ∈ B + the

is holomorphic. Now (4.8) together with Proposition IV.10 imply that I(λ) extends to a
continuous function on TW − ρ which is holomorphic on TW 0 − ρ and bounded when restricted
to TW − mρn provided m is chosen sufficiently large.

Lemma IV.14. If m ∈ N is sufficiently large, then the function
                                 TW 0 − mρn → C, λ 7→ c(λ + ρ)
is holomorphic and bounded.
Proof.    In view of ρn ∈ iz(k)∗ , this is immediate from Theorem II.14.

Theorem IV.15.        (The formal dimension for the relative holomorphic discrete series on a
compactly causal symmetric space) Let H\G be a simply connected symmetric space associated
to a compactly causal symmetric Lie algebra (g, τ ) and (πλ , Hλ ) be an unitary highest weight
representations of G for which F (λ) is H ∩ K -spherical. Then the following assertions hold:
  (i) The representation (πλ , Hλ ) belongs to the relative discrete series for H\G if and only if
      the condition
     (RDS)                             (∀α ∈ ∆+

      is satisfied.
 (ii) If (πλ , Hλ ) belongs to the relative discrete series of H\G, then the formal dimension d(λ)
      is given by
                                            d(λ) = d(λ)G c(λ + ρ),
     where d(λ)G is the formal dimension of (πλ , Hλ ) relative to G and c is the c-function of
     the non-compactly c-dual space H c \Gc of H\G (cf. Theorem II.14). Here the right hand
     side has to be understood as an analytic continuation of a product of two meromorphic
     functions.

(cf. [HC56, Th. 4]). In particular for m ∈ N sufficiently large, the prescription λ 7→   d(λ)G   defines
a bounded holomorphic function on the affine tube TW 0 − mρn .
       Now it follows from Lemma IV.13 and Lemma IV.14 that the function
                                                                        1

is holomorphic and bounded for m sufficiently large. For such m Theorem III.6 implies that
f (λ) = 0 for all λ ∈ W 0 − mρn which are dominant integral with respect to ∆+         k . Thus the
identity criterion of Proposition A.2 in Appendix A applies and yields f = 0 . We conclude in
particular that I(λ)−1 defines a continuation of λ 7→ d(λ)G c(λ + ρ) to a continuous function
on TW − ρ which is holomorphic when restricted to the interior TW 0 − ρ. Since by definition
d(λ) = I(λ)−1 , the assertion in (ii) follows because λ satisfies (RDS) if and only if λ ∈ TW − ρ.
     The following result has already been obtained earlier by Faraut, Hilgert and Ólafsson in
[FHÓ94, Lemma 9.2], but with a completely different type of arguments (see also Theorem II.14).

Corollary IV.16.     Suppose that (g, τ ) = (h ⊕ h, σ) is of group type (cf. Lemma I.3(i)(2)).
Then the domain of convergence E for c is given by

                                  E = ia∗ + (− int Cmin

and there exists a constant γ > 0 only depending on the choice of the various Haar measures
such that
                                                 1

for λ ∈ E .
Proof.     In the following we use the notation of Remark III.5. Since (g, τ ) is of group type
we have d(λ)G = d(λ)(G0 ×G0 ) = (d(λ)G0 )2 , and so it follows from Theorem IV.15(ii) that
c(λ + ρ) = d(λ)1 G0 holds for the analytic continuations. In view of Harish-Chandra’s formula for
d(λ)G0 (cf. [HC56, Th. 4]), this proves the corollary.

Problems . The discrete series on H\G are constructed by analytic methods, i.e., with
generating functions (cf. [FJ80], [MaOs84], [ÓØ91]). But from the algebraic point of view there
are still some interesting open problems.
(a) Using the classification sheme of unitary highest weight modules (cf. [EHW83]) together
with the fine structure theory of compactly causal symmetric Lie algebras provided by Theorem
IV.4 and [Ól91] one can check case by case that (RDS) implies that N (λ) = L(λ). In view of
Proposition II.7(ii), this gives a more algebraic proof of the fact that (RDS) implies that (πλ , Hλ )
is H -spherical whenever (πλK , F (λ)) is H ∩ K -spherical. The following questions are therefore
natural: What is the algebraic impact of the condition (RDS)? Does there exists an analog of
the Parthasarathy-condition (cf. [EHW83. Prop. 3.9]) for the symmetric space setting?
(b) Give a complete classification of H -spherical unitary highest weight representations. A first
step in this direction might be Proposition II.7(ii) and Remark II.8.



              V. Applications to holomorphic representation theory
      In this final section we give a second application of the Averaging Theorem: We relate the
spherical character of a spherical unitary highest weight representation of G to the corresponding
spherical functions on the c-dual space.



                          Spherical functions and character theory

Definition V.1. Let (πλ , Hλ ) be an H -spherical unitary highest weight representation of G.
If 0 6= ν ∈ (Hλ−ω )H and vλ is an highest weight vector, then we define the spherical character
Θλ of (πλ , Hλ ) by

                                  0                 hvλ , vλ i
                            Θλ : Smax → C, s 7→                hπλ (s).ν, νi.
                                                   |hν, vλ i|2
                                                           0
Note that Θλ is an H -biinvariant holomorphic function on Smax (cf. [KNÓ97, Lemma V.6]).

Remark V.2. The particular normalization of Θλ has two reasons. First that it coincides in
the group case (cf. Remark III.5) with the standard definition, and second because it has the
                                                               0
best analytic properties for the assignments λ 7→ Θλ (s), s ∈ Smax (as less poles as possible).

Definition V.3.        (Spherical Functions) Recall the definition of the domain EΩ ⊆ a∗C (cf.
Definition II.12). If λ ∈ EΩ , then the spherical function with parameter λ is defined by
                                                      Z
                              0
                        ϕλ : Smax ∩ HAN → C, s 7→         aH (sh)λ−ρ dµH (h)
                                                         H

(cf. [FHÓ94] or [KNÓ98]). Recall that the defining integrals converge absolutely if and only if
λ ∈ EΩ (cf. [FHÓ94, Th. 6.3]).

Theorem V.4.       Let (πλ , Hλ ) be an H -spherical unitary highest weight representation of G
such that λ + ρ ∈ EΩ holds. Then the spherical character Θλ of (πλ , Hλ ) and the spherical
function ϕλ+ρ are related by

                                0                                1
                         (∀s ∈ Smax ∩ HAN )       Θλ (s) =            ϕλ+ρ (s).
                                                             c(λ + ρ)
                                                                                   0
In particular, ϕλ+ρ extends naturally to a H -biinvariant holomorphic function on Smax .
Proof.     Since λ + ρ ∈ EΩ , the assumption of Theorem II.16 is satisfied and we can rewrite
0 6= ν ∈ (Hλ−ω )H as                             Z
                                     hν, vλ i
                          ν=                        πλ (h).vλ dµH (h).
                               hvλ , vλ ic(λ + ρ) H
Thus if we replace the first ν in the definition of Θλ by this expression, we get for all s ∈
 0
Smax ∩ HAN that

                        hvλ , vλ i

Remark V.5. (a) We remark here that the relation in Theorem V.4 was long time searched
by G. Ólafsson (cf. [Ól98, Open Problem 7(1)]). For further interesting problems related to this
subject we refer to [Fa98] and [Ól98].
(b) The analytic continuation of the relation in Theorem V.4 has been obtained in [HiKr98].
It has far reaching consequences for the theory of G-invariant Hilbert spaces of holomorphic
functions on G-invariant subdomains of the Stein manifold Ξ0max = G ×H iWmax   0

it implies the Plancherel Theorem for these class of Hilbert spaces (cf. [HiKr98]). For further
information related to this subject we refer to [HiKr99b], [KNÓ97], [Kr98,99b] and [Ne99a].

                                               Appendix



          A. An identity criterion for bounded analytic functions on tubes

Lemma A.1. Let Π+ : = {z ∈ C: Im(z) > 0} be the upper half plane and H ∞ : = {f ∈
Hol(Π+ ): kf k∞ < ∞} the Banach space of bounded holomorphic functions on it. Let α > 0
and N = {nαi: n ∈ N} . Then the following identity assertion for elements f of H ∞ (Π+ ) holds:
If f |N = 0 , then f = 0 .
Proof. Let D: = {z ∈ C: |z| < 1} and H ∞ (D) = {f ∈ Hol(D): kf k∞ < ∞} . Let f ∈ H ∞ (D)
and {βn : n ∈ N} be subset of zeros of f . Then it follows from [Ru70, Th. 15.23] that

We consider the Cayley transform

                                                     z−i
                                        c: Π+ → D, z 7→  ,
                                                     z+i
which is an biholomorphic isomorphism, defining an isomorphism of Banach spaces

                             c∗ : H ∞ (D) → H ∞ (Π+ ), f 7→ fe = f ◦ c.

Let αn : = nαi . Then we have
                                                      nαi − i   nα − 1

Let N0 ∈ N be such that nα − 1 > 0 for all n ≥ N0 . Then

                    X                   ∞
                                        X                       ∞
                                                                X
                                                      nα − 1        2
(A.2)                   (1 − |βn |) ≥          (1 −          )=          = ∞.
                    n=1
                                                      nα + 1      nα + 1

Thus if fe ∈ H ∞ (Π+ ) vanishes on all αn , n ∈ N, then f (βn ) = 0 for all n ∈ N and so f = 0 by
(A.1) and (A.2). Therefore fe = c∗ (f ) = 0 , proving the lemma.

Proposition A.2.        Let Ø 6= W ⊆ Rn be an open convex cone, TW : = Rn + iW the
associated tube domain in Cn and H ∞ (TW ) = {f ∈ Hol(TW ): kf k∞ < ∞} the space of bounded
holomorphic functions on TW . Let Γ ⊆ Rn be a lattice. Then the following identity assertion
holds:
                          (∀f ∈ H ∞ (TW )) f |i(Γ∩W ) = 0 ⇒ f = 0.
Proof. We prove the assertion by induction on the dimension n ∈ N.
      If n = 1 , then Γ = Zα for some α > 0 and W = R, R+ or R− . If W = R, then the
assertion follows from Liouville’s Theorem. In the two remaining cases the assertion follows from
Lemma A.1.

      Suppose now the assertion is true for all all dimensions less or equal to n − 1 , n ≥ 2 . Let
f ∈ H ∞ (Rn + iW ) be an element vanishing on i(Γ ∩ W ). We have to show that f = 0 . Since W
is open, we find a basis e1 , . . . , en of Rn which is contained in Γ∩W . By the Identity Theorem
                                                                                               Pn       for
analytic functions, it suffices to prove the assertion for Γ = Ze1 ⊕. . .⊕Zen and W = j=1 R+ ej .
                                                      Pn−1
Let Γn−1 = Ze1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Zen−1 and Wn−1 = j=1 R+ ej . Write the variables z ∈ Cn as tuples
z = (z ′ , zn ) with z ′ = (z1 , . . . , zn−1 ). By induction we obtain that f (z) = f (z ′ , zn ) does not
depend on the z ′ -variable. Thus f (z) = F (zn ) for some F ∈ H ∞ (Π+ ) with F |Ni = 0 . Thus by
the induction hypothesis F = 0 , and hence f = 0 establishing the induction step.




                     B. A lemma on spherical highest weight modules
      Throughout this subsection (g, τ ) denotes a simple hermitian symmetric Lie algebra. Fur-
ther we use the notation from Section I-II.

Lemma B.1. Suppose that (g, τ ) is a simple hermitian symmetric Lie algebra and (G, τ ) an
associated simply connected Lie group. Set H = Gτ and assume that there exist a non-trivial H -
spherical unitary highest weight representation (πλ , Hλ ) of G. Then the symmetric Lie algebra
(g, τ ) has to be compactly causal.
Proof.     Write g = k ⊕ p for a τ -invariant Cartan decomposition of g and let K denote the
analytic subgroup of G corresponding to k.
     By assumption we have (Hλ−ω )H 6= {0} . In particular we can conclude that the module
L(λ) of K -finite vectors of (πλ , Hλ ) admits nontrivial H ∩ K -fixed vectors. Recall that L(λ) is
the unique irreducible quotient of the generalized Verma module

                                    N (λ) = U(gC ) ⊗U (kC ⊕p+ ) F (λ).

In particular, there exists an element 0 6= v0 ∈ N (λ)H∩K .
       Recall that N (λ) is kC -isomorphic to S(p− ) ⊗ F (λ), where the kC -action on S(p− ) ⊗ F (λ)
is defined by

(B.1)                              X.(p ⊗ v): = [X, p] ⊗ v + p ⊗ X.v

for X ∈ kC , p ∈ S(p− ) and v ∈ F (λ) (cf. [EHW83]).
      In order to show that (g, τ ) is compactly causal, we have to prove z(k) ⊆ q . Assume
the contrary, i.e., z(k) ⊆ h. Recall the definition of the element Z0 ∈ z(k) from Section I
and set X0 : = −iZ0 ∈ iz(k). Then the spectrum of X0 , considered as an operator on the
symmetricLalgebra   S(p− ), is −N0 , and we
                                         L∞obtain a natural grading by homogeneous elements:
            ∞
S(p ) = n=0 S(p ) . Then N (λ) = n=0 S(p− )−n ⊗ F (λ) and we conclude
    −               − −n
                                                                            P∞ from (B.1) that
X0 acts on S(p− )−n ⊗ F (λ) byL  −n + λ(X0 ) times the identity. Write v = n=0 v0−n according
to the decomposition N (λ) = ∞            − −n
                                  n=0 S(p )    ⊗ F (λ). Since X0 ∈ i(h ∩ k), the element v0 is
annihilated by X0 and so we must have v0 = v0−n for some n ∈ N0 with λ(X0 ) = n ≥ 0 . But a
necessary condition for L(λ) to be unitarizable is λ(X0 ) < 0 (cf. [Ne99b, Th. XI.2.37(ii)]). This
gives us a contradiction and proves the lemma.
