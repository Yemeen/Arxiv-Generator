                                             (resp. Hρk ) be the category of Harish-Chandra modules with the generalized
                                             infinitesimal character of the trivial module attached to G (resp. H). I’ll surprise
                                             nobody by claiming that H is a subgroup of G. What’s far less obvious, but proved
                                             by Khoroshkin [K], is the existence of a full embedding F of Hρk into Hρn (Fuser
                                             [F,Thm I.4.2] showed that F is even Ext-full, that is compatible with Ext calculus),
                                             prompting the question : is there a geometric interpretation of the embedding
                                             F ? The first candidate for F is the (ordinary) induction functor ; but this fails
                                             miserably — so let’s break the pseudo-suspense of this introduction by saying that
                                             I claim that F is (isomorphic to) a certain cohomological induction functor, and
                                             conjecture that this phenomenon is general.

                                                                               1. Statements
                                             Let G be a center free connected semisimple Lie group, K ⊂ G a maximal compact
                                             subgroup, g ⊃ k the respective complexified Lie algebras. Let’s start by recalling the
                                             notion of Harish-Chandra module. Say that a g-module V is k-finite if it is a sum
                                             of finite dimensional sub-k-modules, and that V is an (g, k)-module if it is k-finite
                                             and k-semisimple. The category H = H(g, K) of Harish-Chandra modules is the
                                             full subcategory of g-mod whose objects are those (g, k)-modules of finite length V
                                             such that for any finite dimensional k-invariant subspace F ⊂ V the action of k
                                             on F exponentiates to K. The category H is a C-category in the sense of Bass [B]
                                             page 57. Let I be the annihilator of the trivial module in the center of U (g), let

                                                                                 Hρ = Hρ (g, K)

                                             be the full sub-C-category of H whose objects are annihilated by some power of I,
                                             let I be the set of isomorphism classes of simple objects of Hρ [it is a finite set] ; for

                                                                                         1
each i ∈ I choose a representative Vi ∈ i and let ℓ(i) be the projective dimension
of Vi [i.e. the supremum in Z ∪ {+∞} of the set {n ∈ Z | Extn (Vi , −) 6= 0}].



(1) Definition. The Hρ -ordering is the smallest partial ordering ≤ on I satisfy-

                                i, j ∈ I

                                                  

(2) Definition. The sub-C-category generated by the subset J of Hρ is the
    full sub-C-category hJ iHρ of Hρ characterized by the condition that an object
    V of Hρ belongs to hJ iHρ iff each simple subquotient of V is isomorphic to Vj
    for some j ∈ J .



(3) Definition. Say that a full sub-C-category C of Hρ is Ext-full in Hρ if for all
    V, W ∈ C the natural morphism



                              Ext•C (V, W ) → Ext•Hρ (V, W )



    is an isomorphism.



For i ∈ I put Ji := {j ∈ I | j ≤ i}, let θ be the Cartan involution of (g, K), denote
by d the dimension of G/K, and consider the following

                                             2
(4) Property of G. For each i ∈ I such that Vi is unitary the cohomology
   H d−ℓ(i) (g, K ; Vi ) is nonzero and there is a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra of g
   with Levi subgroup L = Li (see Vogan [V2,4.1,4.2] for definitions) satisfying

   (a) the corresponding cohomological induction functor F (see [KV]) sets up an
       equivalence
                                                    ∼
                                 Hρ (l, L ∩ K) → hJi iHρ (g,K) ;

   (b) F C ≃ Vi ;

   (c) hJi iHρ (g,K) is Ext-full in Hρ (g, K) ;

   (d) if a is nonzero vector of H d−ℓ(i) (g, K ; Vi ) and V a simple object of Hρ (l, L ∩
       K), then the map


                          H • (l, L ∩ K; V )   → H d−ℓ(i)+• (g, K; F V )

                                  x            7→        F (x) ∪ a


       [where ∪ denotes the cup-product] is an isomorphism [of H • (l, L ∩ K; C)-
       modules] ;


   (e) we have 2 ℓ(i) = d + dim L/(L ∩ K).

Note once and for all that (e) follows from (a) by the well known argument which
consists in setting V := C and using Poincaré duality.

(6) Conjecture. All center free connected semisimple Lie groups have Prop-
   erty (4).

  A partial proof (with explicitly indicated gaps) of the fact that P U (n, 1),
P Spin(n, 1) and SL(3, R) have Property (4) is contained in the expanded version
