                                            1     Introduction
                                            The representation theory of the affine Hecke algebras has two different approaches.
                                            One is a geometric approach and the other is a combinatorial one.
                                                 In the equal parameter case, affine Hecke algebras are constructed using equivariant
                                            K-groups, and their irreducible representations are constructed on Borel-Moore homolo-
                                            gies. By this method, their irreducible representations are parameterized by the index
                                            triples ([CG],[KL]). On the other hand, G. Lusztig classified the irreducible represen-
                                            tations in the unequal parameter case. His ideas are to use equivariant cohomologies
                                            and graded Hecke algebras ([Lus89],[LusI],[LusII],[LusIII]).
                                                 Although the geometric approach will give us a powerful method for the classifica-
                                            tion, but it does not tell us the detailed structure of irreducible representations. Thus
                                            it is important to construct them explicitly in combinatorial approach.
                                                 Using semi-normal representations and the generalized Young tableaux, A. Ram con-
                                            structed calibrated irreducible representations with equal parameters ([Ram1]). Fur-
                                            thermore C. Kriloff and A. Ram constructed irreducible calibrated representations of
                                            graded Hecke algebras ([KR]). However, we cannot always construct irreducible repre-
                                            sentations by combinatorial manner.
                                                 A. Ram classified irreducible representations of affine Hecke algebras of type A1 , A2 ,
                                            B2 , G2 in equal parameter case ([Ram2]). But there are some mistakes in his list of
                                            irreducible representations and his construction of induced representation of type B2 .
                                                 In this paper, we will correct his list about type B2 and also classify the irreducible
                                            representations in the unequal parameter case. There are three one-parameter families
                                            of calibrated irreducible representations and some other irreducible representations.

2     Preliminaries
2.1     Affine Hecke algebra
We will use following notations.

      (R, R+ , Π)   a root system of finite type, its positive roots and simple roots,
      Q, P          the root lattice and the weight lattice of R,
      Q∨ , P ∨      the coroot lattice and the coweight lattice of R
      W             the Weyl group of R,
      ℓ(w)          the length of w ∈ W

We put Π = {αi }i∈I , and denote by si the simple reflection associated with αi .
First we define the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of W.

Definition 2.1. Let {qi }i∈I be indeterminates. Then the Iwahori-Hecke algebra H of
W is the associative algebra over C (qi ) defined by following generators and relations;

                       generators      Ti (i ∈ I)
                         relations     (Ti − qi )(Ti + qi−1 ) = 0 (i ∈ I),
                                           mij               mij
                                       z }| { z }| {
                                       Ti Tj Ti · · · = Tj Ti Tj · · ·,

where mij = 2, 3, 4, 6 according to hαi , αj∨ihαj αi∨ i = 0, 1, 2, 3.

Remark 1. Indeterminates qi , qj must be equal if and only if αi , αj are in the same
W -orbit in R. If all qi are equal, we call the equal parameter case, and otherwise, the
unequal parameter case.

   For a reduced expression si1 si2 · · · sir of w ∈ W , we define Tw = Ti1 Ti2 · · · Tir . This
does not depend on the choice of reduced expressions.
   Let us define the affine Hecke algebras.

Definition 2.2. The affine Hecke algebra H b is the associative algebra over C (qi ; i ∈ I)
defined by following generators and relations;

         generators       Tw X λ (w ∈ W, λ ∈ P ∨ ),
           relations      (Ti − qi )(Ti + qi−1 ) = 0 (i ∈ I),
                          Tw Tw′ = Tww′ if ℓ(w) + ℓ(w ′) = ℓ(ww ′) (w, w ′ ∈ W ),
                          X λ X µ = X λ+µ (λ, µ ∈ P ∨),
                                                            X λ − X si λ
                          X λ Ti = Ti X si λ + (qi − qi−1 )          ∨   (i ∈ I).
                                                            1 − X −αi

2.2     Principal series representations and their irreducibility
                ∨                                       ∨          ∗                        ∨
Let us put X P = {X λ |λ ∈ P ∨ } and let χ : X P → C                   be a character of X P .

Definition 2.3. Let C vχ be the one-dimensional representation of C [X] defined by

                                      X λ · vχ = χ(X λ )vχ .
                  b
We call M(χ) = IndH            b                                                        b asso-
                  C [X] C vχ = H ⊗C          [X]   C vχ the principal representation of H
ciated with χ.


                                                   2
   Note that ResHH M(χ) is isomorphic to the regular representation of H, so that
dim M(χ) = |W |.
   We put
                          qα = qi for α∨ ∈ W αi∨ (i ∈ I).

Theorem 2.1 (Kato’s Criterion of Irreducibility). Let us put
                                                         ∨
                            P (χ) = {α∨ > 0|χ(X α ) = qα±2 }.

Then M(χ) is irreducible if and only if P (χ) = φ.
                                                b we put
   For any finite-dimensional representation of H

             Mχ = {v ∈ M|X λ v = χ(X λ )v for anyX λ ∈ X},
                                                                  

2.3    W-action Lemma
Let us define the action of Weyl group W as the following;
                                               −1 λ
                       (w · χ)(X λ ) = χ(X w          ) (w ∈ W, λ ∈ P ∨).

The following proposition is well known.

Proposition 2.2 (W-action Lemma).
(1) If M(χ) ∼
            = M(χ′ ), then there exists w ∈ W such that χ = wχ.
(2) The representations M(χ) and M(wχ) have the same composition factors.

2.4    Specialization lemma
Let K be a field and S a discrete valuation ring such that K is the fraction field of S .
Let us denote the m = (π) the maximal ideal of S and let F = S /m be the residue field
of S . Let K(H bF -mod) be the Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional
representations of HbF .
    the following lemma is well-known (e.g. see [Ari, Lemma 13.16].)

Lemma 2.1 (Specialization Lemma). Let V be an H         bK -module and L an HbS -
                                                                      bF -mod) is
submodule of V which is an S -lattice of full rank. Then [L ⊗ F ] ∈ K(H
determined by V and does not depend on the choice of L.

2.5      Key results for type B2
Let us consider the type B2 ;

                 P ∨ = Z ε1 ⊕ Z ε2 , R∨ = {α1∨ = ε1 − ε2 , α2∨ = 2ε2 }, Xi = X εi .
                 s1 ε1 = ε2 , s1 ε2 = ε1 , s2 ε1 = ε1 , s2 ε2 = −ε2

Let us recall the definition of affine Hecke algebra of type B2 with unequal parameters.

Definition 2.5. The affine Hecke algebraH   b of type B2 is the associative algebra over
C (p, q) defined by the following generators and relations;

             generators       T1 , T2 , X1 , X2
             relations        (T1 − q)(T1 + q −1 ) = 0, (T2 − p)(T2 + p−1 ) = 0,
                              T1 T2 T1 T2 = T2 T1 T2 T1 ,
                              T1 X2 T1 = X1 ,             T2 X2−1 T2 = X2 ,
                              T2 X1 = X1 T2 ,             X1 X2 = X2 X1 .

                                                  b 2 );
    We will use the following four subalgebras of H(B

      b1 = hT1 , X1 , X2 i,
      H                        b2 = hT2 , X1 , X2 i,
                               H                              H = hT1 , T2 i,                        b
                                                                                      C [X1 , X2 ] ⊂ H.

Lemma 2.2 (Decomposition Lemma). Suppose χ(X αi ) = qi2 , and let ρ1 , ρ2 be the
                                           bi = hTi , Xj (1 ≤ j ≤ 2)i ⊂ H;
following 1-dimensional representations of H                            b

             ρ1 (Xj ) = χ(Xj ), ρ1 (Ti ) = qi , ρ2 (Xj ) = (si χ)(Xj ), ρ2 (Ti ) = −qi−1 .

Then there exists the following short exact sequence;
                                       b                               b
                              0 → IndH                  H
                                     b i ρ2 → M(χ) → IndH
                                     H                  b i ρ1 → 0



3      Classification
3.1      Method
Let M be an irreducible representation which is not principal. Then M appears in some
M(χ). By Kato’s criterion (Theorem 2.1), P (χ) 6= φ. Using W-action Lemma (Lemma
2.2), we may assume P (χ) ∋ α1 or α2 . thus we obtain the following Lemma. We will
use the notation −χ defined by (−χ)(Xi ) = −χ(Xi ) (i = 1, 2).

Lemma 3.1. Except irreducible principal series representations, any finite-dimensional
irreducible representation appears in the principal representations associated with the
following characters as their composition factors;
                                              (1)       (2)      (3)       (4)    (5)

                                                    4
Note 1. Two principal series representations M(−χc ) and M(χc ) have same composition
factors, because of W -action lemma (Lemma 2.2). By replacing u with −u, we don’t
need to consider −χg (u).
    Finaly, we must determine the composition factors of M(χ) for above characters, and
we must prove their irreducibility. But using the decomposition lemma, we consider the
representations induced from H  bi . We will show the examples and some proofs in the
following section.

sition factor and two 1-dimensional composition factors. And their representation ma-
trices are obtained by putting p2 = −q 2 in above matrices, since specialization lemma

(7) Using the following automorphisms of Hb

               X1 7→ X1 , X2 7→ X2 , T1 7→ T1 , T2 7→ −T2 , q 7→ q, p 7→ ∓p±1

the cases of p = ±q −2 , −q 2 reduces the case (4). Similarly, the cases of p = ±q −1 , −q
reduces the case (5). The case of p2 = −q −2 also reduces the case (6).


Note 2. In [Ram2], Ram dealt equal parameter case i.e. p = q case. However the case

χd does not appear in his list. Also he did not explicitly list −χa , −χb , −χd , −χd , −χd

4     Tables of irreducible representations
We will summarize about the dimension of composition factors and their calibratability.
Note that we will omit the principal series representation M(−χ) and their composition
factors in the following tables.
