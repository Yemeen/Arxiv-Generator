                                             0. Introduction.

                                             0.1. Let G be a simply connected semi-simple complex algebraic group. Fix a maximal
                                             torus T and a Borel subgroup B such that T ⊂ B ⊂ G. Let W the Weyl group of
                                             G relative to T . For any w in W , let Xw = BwB/B denote the Schubert variety
                                             corresponding to w. This article is concerned with the following problem.
                                             Degeneration Problem. Is there a flat family over SpecC[t], such that the general
                                             fiber is Xw and the special fiber is a toric variety?
                                             The existence of such a degeneration was obtained by N. Gonciulea and V. Lakshmibai
                                             for G = SLn , [7]. Their proof is based on the theory of standard monomials. In the
                                             case G = SLn , the corner stone of their proof is the following : fundamental weights
                                             are minuscule weights, hence, a basis of every fundamental representation is endowed
                                             with a structure of distributive lattice.
                                                  A toric degeneration for Schubert varieties is given in [5], [6], for G of rank 2. The
                                             proofs rely on the theory of standard monomials as well. A natural question would be
                                             : is there a (flat) toric degeneration of the flag variety G/B which restricts to a toric

                                                                                          1
degeneration of the Schubert varieties Xw for any w in the Weyl group? In [4], R. Chirivi
gives a degeneration of the flag variety which restricts into semi-toric degenerations of
the Schubert varieties, i.e. finite unions of irreducible toric varieties. An explanation
of this fact was given to us by O. Mathieu : intersections of irreducible toric varieties
are irreducible toric varieties, but intersection of Schubert varieties can be a union of
several Schubert varieties. Hence, the answer to the previous question is negative. In
[4], the Degeneration Problem is solved with toric replaced by semi-toric.
0.2. Our approach of the problem is based on the canonical/global base of Lusztig/Ka-
shiwara and the so-called string parametrization of this base studied by P. Littelmann
in [10] and made precise by A. Berenstein and A. Zelevinsky in [1].
     Fix w in W . Let P + be the semigroup of dominant weights. For all λ in P + ,
let Lλ be the line
                L bundle 0on G/B corresponding to λ. Then, the direct     sum of global
                                                                   +
sections Rw := λ∈P + H (Xw , Lλ ) carries a natural structure of P -graded C-algebra.
Moreover, there exists a natural action of T on Rw . Our principal result can be stated
as follows :
                                                  w
Theorem. Fix w in W . There exists a filtration (Fm )m∈N of Rw such that
                        w
  (i) for all m in N, Fm  is compatible with the P + -grading of Rw ,
                        w
 (ii) for all m in N, Fm is compatible with the action of T ,
(iii) the associated graded algebra is the C-algebra of the semigroup of integral points in
 a rational convex polyhedral cone.
This cone depends on the choice of a reduced decomposition w̃0 of the longest element
w0 of the Weyl group. Explicit equations for the faces of this cone can be obtained
from [10] for so-called nice decompositions w̃0 . More generally, those equations were
obtained in [1] from w̃0 -trails in fundamental Weyl modules of the Langlands dual of G.
      This theorem gives a positive answer to the Degeneration Problem. Indeed, let
λ be a regular dominant   L weight,    then the line bundle Lλ is ample and Xw is the
                                     0
projective spectrum of       m∈N H (Xw , Lmλ ). Moreover, the spectrum of a noetherian
graded algebra associated to a filtration of a noetherian algebra R is a flat degeneration
of Spec(R). This is proved as follows by a standard argument : let t be an indeteminate
and consider the filtration (Rn )n∈N of R. Then, the C[t]-algebra Rt = ⊕n Rn tn is flat
over C[t] and it verifies Rt /(t − t0 )Rt ≃ R for t0 6= 0 and Rt /tRt ≃ GrR.
      Let U be the maximal unipotent subgroup of B. Hence, Rw0 is the algebra C[G/U ]
of regular functions on G/U . For any w, the algebras Rw are quotients of this algebra.
                                                                              w
If w̃0 is adapted to w in the sense of Definition 2.4, then the filtration (Fm  )m∈N is the
                           w0                                               w0
quotient filtration of (Fm )m∈N . In general, the quotient filtration (F m )m∈N of Rw
provides a graded associated algebra whose spectrum is a semi-toric variety.
The proof of the theorem is based on two facts.
Let U − be the maximal unipotent subgroup of G which is opposite to U . Set B − = T U − .
Then, the algebra C[G/U ] embeds in C[B − ]. Moreover, we can embed the (specialized)
dual of the canonical base in the algebra C[U − ]. We prove that this dual has good
multiplicative properties inherited from the quantum case, see Theorem 2.3. This part
of the article is inspired by [13]. But here, we don’t use the positivity arguments or the
elaborate Hall algebra model, only true for the simply laced case.

                                             2
In a second step we show how to restrict from flag variety to Schubert varieties : this
part relies on the compatibility of the canonical base with the Demazure modules, [9],
[10].

1. Notations and recollection on global basis.

1.1. Denote by G a semisimple simply connected complex Lie group. Fix a torus T of
G and let B be a Borel subgroup such that T ⊂ B ⊂ G. Denote by U the unipotent
radical of B. Let B − be the opposite Borel subgroup and U − be its unipotent radical.
Let g, resp. h, n, b, n− , b− , be Lie C-algebra of G, resp. T , U , B, U − , B − . Let n be
the rank of g. We have the triangular decomposition g = n− + h + n. Let {αi }i be a
basis of the root system ∆ corresponding to this decomposition. Let P be thePweight
lattice generated by the fundamental weights ̟i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and let P + := i N̟i
be the semigroup of integral dominant weights. Let W be the Weyl group, generated
by the reflections sαi corresponding to the simple roots αi , and let w0 be the longest
element of W . We denote by ( , ) the W -invariant form on P .
1.2. Let d be an integer such that (P, P ) ⊂ (2/d)Z. Let q be a indeterminate and set
K = C(q 1/d ). Let Uq (g) be the simply connected quantized enveloping algebra on K,
as defined in [3]. Set di = (αi , αi )/2 and qi = q di for all i. Let Uq (n), resp. Uq (n− ),
be the subalgebra generated by the canonical generators Eαi , resp. Fαi , of positive,
resp. negative, weights and the quantum Serre relations. For all λ in P , let Kλ the
corresponding element in the algebra Uq0 = K[P ] of the torus of Uq (g). We have the
triangular decomposition Uq (g) = Uq (n− ) ⊗ Uq0 ⊗ Uq (n). We set

                 Uq (b) = Uq (n) ⊗ Uq0 ,          Uq (b− ) = Uq (n− ) ⊗ Uq0 .

     Uq (g) is endowed with a structure of Hopf algebra and the comultiplication ∆, the
antipode S and the augmentation ε are given by

        ∆Ei = Ei ⊗ 1 + Kαi ⊗ Ei , ∆Fi = Fi ⊗ Kα−1
                                                i
                                                  + 1 ⊗ Fi , ∆Kλ = Kλ ⊗ Kλ

                   S(Ei ) = −Kα−2
                                i
                                  Ei , S(Fi ) = −Fi Kα2 i , S(Kλ ) = K−λ
                              ε(Ei ) = ε(Fi ) = 0, ε(Kλ ) = 1.

If M is a Uq0 -module and γ ∈ P , we set Mγ := {m ∈ M, Kλ .m = q (λ,γ) }.
                                                                                1−qin
      For n a non negative integer and α a positive root, we set : [n]i =       1−qi ,   [n]i ! =
[n]i [n − 1]i . . . [1]i .
1.3. The dual Uq (g)∗ is endowed with a structure of left, resp. right, Uq (g)-module
by u.c(a) = c(au), resp. c.u(a) = c(ua), u, a ∈ Uq (g), c ∈ Uq (g)∗ . If M is a finite
dimensional left Uq (g)-module, we endow the dual M ∗ with a structure of left Uq (g)-
module by uξ(v) = ξ(S(u)v), u ∈ Uq (g), ξ ∈ M ∗ , v ∈ M .
    For all λ in P + , let Vq (λ) be the simple Uq (g)-module with highest weight λ. We
can embed Vq (λ)∗ ⊗ Vq (λ) in Uq (g)∗ by setting ξ ⊗ v(u) = ξ(u.v), u ∈ Uq (g), ξ ∈ Vq (λ)∗ ,

                                             3
v ∈ Vq (λ). Let vλ be a highest weight vector of Vq (λ). For all integral dominant weight
λ, let C(λ), resp. C + (λ), be the subspace ofL
                                              Uq (g)∗ generated by the ξ ⊗L v, resp. ξ ⊗ vλ ,
           ∗                                                                          +
ξ ∈ Vq (λ) , v ∈ Vq (λ). We set Cq [G] =       λ∈P + C(λ), Cq [G/U ] =        λ∈P + C (λ).
Then, Cq [G] and Cq [G/U ] are subalgebras of the Hopf dual of Uq (g). Cq [G], resp.
Cq [G/U ], is the algebra of quantum regular functions on G, resp. on the quotient G/U .
1.4. There exists a unique bilinear form ( , ) on Uq (b) × Uq (b− ), see [14], [15], [3], such
that :

(1.4.1)     (u+ , u−  −         +    −    −
                   1 u2 ) = (∆(u ), u1 ⊗ u2 ) ,               u+ ∈ Uq (b) ; u−    −        −
                                                                             1 , u2 ∈ Uq (b )



(1.4.2)     (u+  +    −      +    +      −
              1 u2 , u ) = (u2 ⊗ u1 , ∆(u )) ,                u− ∈ Uq (b− ) ; u+    +
                                                                               1 , u2 ∈ Uq (b)



(1.4.3)                      (Kλ , Kµ ) = q −(λ,µ) ,           λ, µ ∈ P


(1.4.4)                   (Kλ , Fi ) = 0 ,           λ∈P,1≤i≤n


(1.4.5)                   (Ei , Kλ ) = 0 ,           λ∈P,1≤i≤n


(1.4.6)                (Ei , Fi ) = δij (1 − qi2 )−1 ,         1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.

For all β in Q+ , let Uq (n)β , resp. Uq (n− )−β , be the subspace of Uq (n), resp. Uq (n− ),
with weight β, resp. −β. The form ( , ) is non degenerate on Uq (n)β × Uq (n− )−β ,
β ∈ Q+ . We have, by (1.4.1-1.4.5) :

(1.4.7)          (XKλ , Y Kµ ) = q −(λ,µ) (X, Y ) ,             X ∈ Uq (n), Y ∈ Uq (n− )

We can define a bilinear form < , > on Uq (g) × Uq (g) by :

(1.4.8)        < X1 Kλ S(Y1 ), Y2 Kµ S(X2 ) >= (X1 , Y2 )(X2 , Y1 )q −(λ,µ)/2

where X1 , X2 ∈ Uq (n), Y1 , Y2 ∈ Uq (n− ), λ, µ ∈ P . This form is non degenerate.
      There exists an algebra isomorphism from Uq (n) to Uq (n− ) which maps Ei on Fi for
all i. Via this isomorphism, the restriction of the form ( , ) on Uq (n) × Uq (n− ) coincides
with the one defined by Lusztig in [11, par 1].
1.5. Define the maps :

                        β : Uq (b) → Uq (b− )∗ ,         β(u)(v) = (u, v) ;

                        ζ : Uq (g) → Uq (g)∗ ,       ζ(u)(v) =< u, v > .
It follows from 1.4 that :

                                                 4
Lemma. With the previous notations, we have
 (i) β, ζ are injective.
(ii) β is an anti-homomorphism of algebras.

Denote by ρ the restriction homomorphism from Uq (g)∗ onto Uq (b− )∗ . We know, see
[2, Proposition 3.4],
Proposition. The restriction of ρ to Cq [G/U ] is injective. Moreover, for all λ in P + ,
we have
 (i) For all e in Uq (n), ρ(ζ(eK−2λ )) = β(eK−λ ).
(ii) there exists a (unique) subspace Eλ of Uq (n) such that ζ(Eλ K−2λ ) = C + (λ).   ♦

1.6. Let u 7→ u be the K-antihomomorphism of Uq (g) such that E i = Ei , K λ = K−λ ,
F i = Fi . It is easily seen that

                  < u, v >= (u, v) = (u, v) =< u, v >, u ∈ Uq (n), v ∈ Uq (n− ).

Let B be Lusztig’s canonical basis of Uq (n− ), [11], which coincides with Kashiwara’s
global basis, [9]. Let B∗ ⊂ Uq (n) be the dual basis in Uq (n), i.e. (b∗ , b′ ) = δb,b′ . Let Ẽi ,
F̃i : Uq (n− ) → Uq (n− ) be the Kashiwara operators, [loc. cit.]. For b ∈ B, Ẽi (b), resp.
F̃i (b), equals some b′ in B ∪ {0} modulo q −1 Z[q −1 ]B. The assignement b 7→ b′ defines
maps ẽi and f˜i from B to B ∪ {0}. For b ∈ B, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, set εi (b) = Max{r, ẽri (b) 6= 0}.
       Let Li , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, be the adjoint of the left multiplication operator Fi . for the
form ( , ) on Uq (n) × Uq (n− ). Then, Li is a quantum derivation of Uq (n), [11, par 1] :

            Li (eα u) = Li (eα )u + q (α,αi ) eα Li (u), u ∈ Uq (n), eα ∈ Uq (n)α , α ∈ Q.
      (r)         1
Set Li      =         Lr .

The following is a recollection of results about the canonical basis and its dual. As-
sertions (i) and (ii) can be read in [11, 14.4.13,14.4.14]. Assertion (iii) is a standard
consequence of [11, 14.3.2 (c)] by dualization.
 Theorem 1. For b, b′ in B, we have :
  (i) bb′ ∈ Z[q, q −1 ]B,
 (ii) b∗ b′∗ ∈ Z[q, q −1 ]B∗ ,

(iii) Li i (b∗ ) = (ẽi i (b))∗ ,
(iv) b ∈ B.                                                                                     ♦
The following theorem states precisely the compatibility of the canonical basis with the
finite dimensional highest weight modules. It can be found in [9, Proposition 8.2].

Theorem 2. Fix λ in P + , λ = i λi ̟i . Set

                              Bλ := {b ∈ B, εi (b) ≤ λi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.

Then Bλ = {b ∈ B, b.vλ 6= 0} and Bλ .vλ is a basis of Vq (λ).                                   ♦

                                                  5
When b belongs to Bλ , and if no confusion occurs, we shall use the same symbol for b
and b.vλ , i.e. we set b = b.vλ .
1.7. Let A = C[q, q −1 ]. Let UA (n− ) be the A-submodule of Uq (n− ) generated by B.
Then, UA (n− ) is a free A-space and a A-algebra. Indeed, UA (n− ) is the A-algebra
                     1
generated by the [m]   i!
                          Fim , see [8, Theorem 11.10 (b)]. Let UA be the sub-A-algebra
                                  1                    1
of Uq (g) generated by the [m]      i!
                                       Fim , and the [m] i!
                                                            Eim . Then, VA (λ) is a UA -module.
Set VA (λ) = Uq (n− ).vλ ⊂ Vq (λ). Then, VA (λ) is the A-space generated by Bλ . By [8,
Theorem 11.19], we know that B is compatible with specialisation :

                 C ⊗A UA (n− ) ≃ U (n− ), C ⊗A VA (λ) ≃ V (λ), λ ∈ P + ,

where C = A/(q − 1)A as a A-module, U (n− ) is the (classical) enveloping C-algebra of
n− and V (λ) is the classical Weyl module with highest weight λ.
Let VA (λ)∗ be the A-dual of VA (λ). Then, it has a natural UA -module structure by
u.v ∗ ( ) = v ∗ (S(u). ). The module VA (λ)∗ specializes at q = 1 onto the dual g-module
V (λ)∗ .
1.8. Fix λ in P + and w in W . We know that Vq (λ) verifies the Weyl character
formula ; we denote by vwλ an extremal vector of weight wλ. Then, the Uq (b)-module
Vq,w (λ) := Uq (n)vwλ verifies the Demazure character formula. We know, [9, Theorem

Theorem. There exists a subset Bw of B such that Vq,w (λ) is spanned by Bw .vλ .
Moreover, if b is in Bw then ∆(b) ∈< Bw > ⊗ < Kµ .Bw , µ ∈ P >.              ♦
In particular, the orthogonal Vq,w (λ)⊥ in Vq (λ) of the Demazure module Vq,w (λ) is
generated as a space by B(λ) ∩ B\Bw and the dual Vq,w (λ)∗ is generated by the image
of B(λ) ∩ Bw by the quotient morphism.
    As in 1.7, this allows us to define A-forms for Demazure modules. We denote by
VA,w (λ) the A-space generated by B(λ) ∩ Bw . It specializes for q = 1 to the classical
Demazure module Vw (λ).

2. A multiplicative property and Littelmann’s parametrization of the dual
canonical basis.

2.1. For λ in P + and b in Bλ , let b∗λ be the element of Vq (λ)∗ such that b∗λ (b′ .vλ ) = δb,b′ ,
b′ ∈ Bλ , where δ means the Kroenecker symbol.
Lemma. For all λ in P + and b in Bλ , then ζ(b∗ K−2λ ) = b∗λ ⊗vλ , β(b∗ K−λ ) = ρ(b∗λ ⊗vλ ).
Proof. By Lemma 1.5, we only need to prove that < b∗ K−2λ , −− >= b∗λ ⊗ vλ . As
Uq (g) = Uq (b− ) ⊕ (Uq (b− ) ⊗ Uq (n) ∩ Ker(ε)), we only need to prove this on Uq (b− ),
whose basis is given by (b′ Kµ , b′ ∈ B, µ ∈ P ). By (1.4.7) and (1.4.8)

                < b∗ K−2λ , b′ Kµ >= (b∗ , b′ )q λ,µ = δb,b′ q λ,µ = b∗λ (b′ Kµ .vλ ).

This implies the lemma.                                                                         ♦

                                                  6
Remark. By Proposition 1.5, the lemma implies that Eλ is spanned by Bλ∗ .
Let Aq [G/U ] be the sub-A-module of Cq [G] generated by the b∗λ ⊗ vλ , λ ∈ P + and
                ′′
b ∈ Bλ . Let dbb,b′ be the coefficient of b′′∗ in the product b∗ b′∗ .
 Proposition. We have
  (i) K ⊗A Aq [G/U ] = Cq [G]
 (ii) Aq [G/U ] is a A-algebra.
            ′′
(iii) if dbb′ ,b in non zero, then b ∈ Bλ , b′ ∈ Bλ′ implies b′′ ∈ Bλ+λ′ ,
(iv) Aq [G/U ]/(q − 1)Aq [G/U ] ≃ C[G/U ], where C[G/U ] is the C-algebra of regular
      functions on G/U .
 Proof. The A-basis b∗λ of VA (λ)∗ is a K-basis of Vq (λ)∗ . Hence, (i) is clear.
 From Lemma 1.5, Proposition 1.5, and the previous lemma, we have
                                      ∗                       ∗
               β −1 [(b∗λ ⊗ vλ ).(b′λ′ ⊗ vλ′ )] = β −1 (b′λ′ ⊗ vλ′ ).β −1 (b∗λ ⊗ vλ )
                                    ′  ∗                         ′    ∗    X ′′ ∗
  = (b′∗ K−λ′ ).(b∗ K−λ ) = q −(λ ,ω(b )) b′∗ b∗ K−λ−λ′ = q −(λ ,ω(b )) (       dbb′ ,b b′′ )K−λ−λ′ .
                               ∗
We know that (b∗λ ⊗vλ ).(b′λ′ ⊗vλ′ ) belongs to C + (λ+λ′ ) which is generated by b0 ⊗vλ+λ′ ,
b0 ∈ Bλ+λ′ . Hence, applying β −1 , we obtain (iii) and
                               ∗               ′    ∗   X ′′             ∗
(2.1.1)       (b∗λ ⊗ vλ ).(b′λ′ ⊗ vλ′ ) = q −(λ ,ω(b ))  dbb′ ,b (b′′λ+λ′ ⊗ vλ+λ′ ).

This gives (ii). Now, (iv) is clear by 1.7 and the fact that specialization commutes with
tensor product.                                                                        ♦

Corollary. Fix b, b′ , b′′ in B with dbb,b′ non zero. Then, for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we have
εi (b′′ ) ≤ εi (b) + εi (b′ ).
                                                                                     ′′     ′′
Proof. By applying the antiautomorphism −− , we obtain that db′ = dbb,b′ . Set λ =
P                   ′

   i εi (b)̟ i and λ  =   i εi (b   )̟ i . As    is an  involution, we deduce  from [1.6, Theorem

2] that b ∈ Bλ and b ∈ Bλ′ . This gives b ∈ Bλ+λ′ by (iii). Hence, we obtain the
corollary from [1.6, Theorem 2].                                                                ♦
Remark. In the simply laced case, this corollary is easily obtained by the positivity
                                                  ′′
property of the dual canonical basis, i.e. dbb,b′ ∈ N[q, q −1 ] by [11]. For general g, we
can conclude by a standard argument, transmitted by E. Vasserot. It is based on the
                  ′′
realization of dbb,b′ in terms of traces of an automorphism of a diagram on spaces arising
from perverse sheaves, see [11, 14.4.14].
2.2. We introduce Littelmann’s parametrization of the (dual) canonical basis. Fix a
reduced decomposition of the longest element of the Weyl group w0 : w̃0 = si1 . . . siN ,
where N = dimn. For all u in Uq (n) and 1 ≤ i ≤ n, set
                                                                        (ai (u))
                      ai (u) = Max{r, Lri (u) 6= 0}, Λi (u) = Li                   (u).

For all b in B, set

           Aw̃0 (b) = (aiN (b∗ ), aiN −1 (ΛiN (b∗ )), . . . , ai1 (Λi2 . . . ΛiN (b∗ ))) ∈ NN .

                                                    7
This parametrization can be found in [10, par 1]. It coincides with the parametrization
in [1, 3.2] by [1.6, Theorem 1 (iii)]. We now present a theorem due to Littelmann, [10,
par 1], see also [1, 3.10].
Theorem. The map Aw̃0 embeds B into NN . Let C be its image. Then, C is the set
of integral points of a rational convex polyhedral cone of RN . Moreover, set Γw̃0 :=
{(λ, ψ) ∈ P + × C, ψ ∈ Aw̃0 (Bλ )}. Then, Γw̃0 is the set of integral points of a rational
convex polyhedral cone of Rn+N .                                                        ♦
Note that equations of this cone can be given in [1, 3.10]. For all ψ in C, set bψ = bψ
                                                                                      w̃0 =

A−1                              b
 w̃0 (ψ). We also set dψ,ψ ′ := dbψ ,bψ′ .

2.3. Let ≺ be the lexicographical ordering of NN . We have
Theorem. Fix a reduced decomposition w̃0 of the longest element of the Weyl group.
                                                                 ′′
Let b, b′ , b′′ be in B, Aw̃0 (b) = ψ, Aw̃0 (b′ ) = ψ ′ Then, dbb,b′ non zero implies Aw̃0 (b′′ ) ≺
                             ′
                     ψ+ψ
ψ + ψ ′ . Moreover, dψ,ψ ′ is a power of q.
Proof. First remark that ai (uv) = ai (u) + ai (v), u, v in Uq (n), by the quantized Leibniz
rule. Write
                                           X ′′ ∗
(∗)                               b∗ b′∗ =      dbb,b′ b′′

Let ψ ′′ = Aw̃0 (b′′ ), for b′′ in the sum. Then, ψ1′′ ≤ ψ1 + ψ1′ by Corollary 2.1 and [1.6,
                                                                                     ψ +ψ ′
Theorem 1 (iii)]. This gives the first step of the induction. Now, applying LiN1 1 and
                                                P b′′
the Leibniz rule gives ξ1 ΛiN (b∗ )ΛiN (b′∗ ) =  db,b′ ΛiN (b′′∗ ), where the sum is taken over
                ′′                ′′          ′
the elements b such that ψ1 = ψ1 + ψ1 , and where ξ1 is a power of q. Now remark
that, by [1.6, Theorem 1 (iii)], ΛiN (b∗ ), ΛiN (b′∗ ), and the ΛiN (b′′∗ ) all belong to the
dual of the canonical basis. So, we can proceed as for the first step by induction. We
then have the first assertion of the theorem. For conclusion, note that we obtain
                                                               X       ′′
                ξN Λi1 . . . ΛiN (b∗ )Λi1 . . . ΛiN (b′∗ ) =       dbb,b′ Λi1 . . . ΛiN (b′′∗ ),

where the sum is taken over the elements b′′ such that ψk′′ = ψk + ψk′ , for all k and where
ξN is a power of q. Hence, by Theorem 2.2 there is at most one element in the sum and
for this element we have Aw̃0 (b′′ ) = ψ + ψ ′ . By [10, par 1],
Lemma. Λi1 . . . ΛiN (B ∗ ) = 1 for all elements B of the canonical basis.                         ♦
                                 ′
                       ψ+ψ
Hence the coefficient dψ,ψ ′ is a power of q. This finishes the proof of the theorem. ♦
2.4. By 1.8, the results of 2.1, 2.2 can be easily generalized to quotients of Cq [G/U ]
which correspond to Demazure modules. Indeed, fix w in W and let Bw be the comple-
ment of Bw in B. Set
                                     M                         M
                  IA,w :=                        Ab∗ ⊗ vλ =             VA,w (λ)⊥ ⊗ vλ .
                            λ∈P + , b∈Bw ∩B(λ)                     λ


                                                    8
Then, IA,w is the orthogonal < Bw >⊥ of < Bw > in Aq [G/U ]. By Theorem 1.8, IA,w
is an ideal of Aq [G/U ]. We have the following decomposition for the quotient algebra :
                                               M
                            Aq [G/U ]/IA,w =           VA,w (λ)∗ ⊗ vλ .
                                                   λ


From [10, par 1], we have :
Theorem. Let w̃ = si1 . . . sip be a reduced decomposition of w. Then there ex-
ists a reduced decomposition w̃0 = siN . . . si1 of w0 . For this decomposition, we have
Aw̃0 (Bw ) = C ∩ (Np × {0}N−p ).                                                      ♦
Definition. For all w, a reduced decomposition w̃0 = siN . . . si1 of w0 such that w =
si1 . . . sip will be called adapted to w.

3. Specialization.

 3.1. Fix a reduced decomposition w̃0 of w0 . At this stage of the article, we can construct
a NN -filtration of the algebra C[G/U ] such that the associated graded algebra is the
algebra of the semigroup Γw̃0 To be more precise, let b∗λ,ψ in C[G/U ] be the image of
the element (bψ   ∗
               λ ) ⊗ vλ by the morphism of specialization at q = 1, see Proposition 2.1
(iv). We have by Theorem 2.3 and (2.1.1) :
Proposition. The spaces Fψ :=< b∗λ,φ , (λ, φ) ∈ Γw̃0 , φ ≺ ψ}, ψ ∈ C define a filtration
of the algebra C[G/U ]. The graded associated algebra is naturally isomorphic to the
C-algebra of the semigroup Γw̃0 .                                                      ♦
3.2. What results from Proposition 3.1 is that there exists a finite sequence of de-
generations of the flag variety which ends into a toric variety but what we want is a
”degeneration in one step”. Hence, we need a linear form NN → N, which satisfies some
strict inequalities, and which transforms the NN -filtration of C[G/U ] into a N-filtration.
This is made possible because the cone Γw̃0 is convex polyhedral and hence has a finite
presentation. We start by a lemma.
Lemma. Let {ψ 1 , . . . , ψ K } be a finite set of points in NN , and for all k, 1 ≤ k ≤ K,
let φk,l , 1 ≤ l ≤ Kk , be a finite number of points in NN such that φk,l ≺ ψ k for all l.
Then, there exists a linear form e : NN → N such that e(φk,l ) < e(ψ k ) for all k and all
l.
Proof. Let ak , 1 ≤ k ≤ N be the linear form of QN which maps an element of QN to its
k-th coordinate. Set I0 = {(φk,l , ψ k ), 1 ≤ k ≤ K, 1 ≤ l ≤ Kk }. For s, 1 ≤ s ≤ N − 1,
set Is = {(φk,l , ψ k ) ∈ I0 , (φk,l )m = (ψ k )m , 1 ≤ m ≤ s}. All these sets are finite.
      As a first step of our induction, define the linear form eN = aN and fix εN in Q+
such that eN (φk,l )εN < (ψ k )N−1 − (φk,l )N−1 , for all (φk,l , ψ k ) in IN−2 \IN−1 . Define a
linear form by eN−1 = aN−1 + εN eN . By construction, we have eN−1 (φk,l ) < eN−1 (ψ k )
for all (φk,l , ψ k ) in IN−2 . Fix now εN−1 in Q+ such that eN−1 (φk,l )εN < (ψ k )N−2 −
(φk,l )N−2 , for all (φk,l , ψ k ) in IN−3 \IN−2 . Define a linear form by eN−2 = aN−2 +
εN−1 eN−1 . By construction and induction we have eN−2 (φk,l ) < eN−2 (ψ k ) for all

                                               9
(φk,l , ψ k ) in IN−3 . By induction, we obtain a form e1 which verifies e1 (φk,l ) < e1 (ψ k )
for all (φk,l , ψ k ) in I0 . We can multiply e1 by a positive integer in order to obtain a
N-form which verifies the lemma.                                                              ♦
                                                                             P k
Let
P (λki , ψi ), 1 ≤ ik ≤ K,     be the minimal set of generators of Γw̃0 and ( i ni (λi , ψi ) −
                             k
   i mi (λi , ψi )), ni , mi ∈ N, be the (finite) minimal set of generators of the relations.
Then, from Proposition 3.1, we obtain :
Proposition. The (commutative) algebra C[G/U ] is defined by generators b∗λi ,ψi , 1 ≤
i ≤ K, and relations

          P               P
for φ ≺ i nki (λi , ψi ) = i mki (λi , ψi ).
Proof. The algebra C[G/U ] has a natural P + -grading defined by C[G/U ]λ = V (λ)∗ ⊗vλ .
By construction, Fψ = ⊕λ Fψ,λ , where Fψ,λ = Fψ ∩ C[G/U ]λ . Clearly, Fψ,λ is finite
dimensional. Hence, by induction, we obtain that generators of the C-graded algebra of
Proposition 3.1 lift to generators of the algebra C[G/U ]. Hence, we have the first part
of the proposition.
      Now, Proposition 3.1 implies the relations (3.2.1). Let C[Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ K] be the
polynomial algebra with K indeterminates. There exists a surjective morphism ϕ :
C[Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ K]/J → C[G/U ], where J is the ideal generated by the relations resulting
                                              ∗
from (3.2.1). This morphism maps Q mXi i to bλP i ,ψi
                                                      for all i. Endow C[Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ K]/J
with the quotient filtration <      Xi + J,         mi ψi ≺ ψ >ψ∈C . Then, the associated
                                                                                Q     nk
graded algebra is defined by generators GrXi , 1 ≤ i ≤ K, and relations Gr Xi i =
Q        mk
    Gr Xi i . Now, endow C[G/U ] with its C-filtration, see 3.1. By Proposition 3.1, Grϕ
is an isomorphism from GrC[Xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ K]/J onto GrC[G/U ]. This implies that ϕ is
an isomorphism. This finishes the proof of the proposition.                              ♦
             P
Let ψ k := i nki ψi , and for each k, let the φk,l be the elements φ occuring in (3.2.1).
Fix a N-form e as in Lemma 3.2. Then,

Corollary. The spaces Fm (C[G/U ]) =< bλii ,ψi , e( i ski ψi ) ≤ m >, m ∈ N, define a
filtration of C[G/U ]. The graded associated algebra is C[Γw̃0 ].                        ♦
3.3. We now give some analogous results for Demazure modules. Fix w in W with
length p. Set Γw
               w̃0 := Aw̃0 (Bw ). Then,

Lemma. For all reduced decompositions w̃0 of w0 , the set Γw         w̃0 is a finite union of
rational convex polyhedral cones. Moreover, if w̃0 is adapted to w, see Definition 2.4,
then Γw
      w̃0 is a p-dimensional face of Γw̃0 . In particular, it is a rational convex polyhedral
cone.
Proof. Fix w in W and fix a reduced decomposition w̃0 adapted to w. By Theorem
2.4, Γw                                                                                 ′
       w̃0 is a p-dimensional face of Γw̃0 and so it is a convex polyhedral cone. Let w̃0
be another reduced decomposition of w0 which is not supposed adapted to w. Then, by
[1, 3.3], Γw                      w
            w̃ ′ is the image of Γw̃0 by a continuous piecewise linear map l. To be more

precise, there exists a finite set of (convex) cones Ci in Rn+N such that       Ci = Rn+N
                                                                                      ≥0
and such that l is linear on Γw w̃0 ∩ Ci . Hence, we have the lemma.                     ♦
We still denote by vλ a highest weight vector of the classical WeylLmodule V (λ). The
algebra Aq [G/U ] specializes for q = 1 onto the algebra C[G/U ] = λ V (λ)∗ ⊗ vλ . The
algebra
L        Aq [G/U ]/IA,w specializes
                                L for q = 1⊥onto the quotient algebra C[G/U ]/Iw =
           ∗
   λ Vw (λ) ⊗ vλ , where Iw :=     λ∈P + Vw (λ) ⊗ vλ .
     Let w̃0 be adapted to w. By the previous lemma, Γw    w̃0 is generated as a semigroup
by a part of the minimal set of generators (λi , ψi ) of Γw̃0 and with the corresponding
relations. This implies :
Theorem. Choose a reduced decomposition w̃0 adapted to w. Then, the graded associ-
ated algebra of the quotient filtration of (Fm )m∈N on C[G/U ]/Iw is the C-algebra C[Γw
                                                                                      w̃0 ]
                    w
of the semigroup Γw̃0 .                                                                 ♦
Remark. Note that this filtration (and hence the corresponding degeneration) depends
on the choice of the N-form e of Lemma 3.2, and of the reduced decomposition w̃0
adapted to w. For a general reduced decomposition w̃0′ of w0 , Lemma 3.3 implies that
the spectrum of the associated graded algebra is a union of irreducible components
which are toric varieties.
