                                             1         Introduction
                                             In articles [17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 35] Gaussian quasi-invariant
                                             measures on groups of diffeomorphisms and loop groups G relative to dense
                                             subgroups G′ were constructed. In the non-Archimedean case the wider
                                             class of measures was investigated, than in the real case. The cases of
                                             Riemann and non-Archimedean manifolds were considered. There are few
                                             approaches for the construction of irreducible unitary representations. In
                                             articles [14, 18, 23, 24, 25] representations of dense subgroups G′ associated
                                             with quasi-invariant measures on the entire groups were considered. In ar-
                                             ticles [12, 20, 21] irreducible representations of groups of diffeomorphisms
                                             Dif f (M) associated with measures on specific subsets of the unital type
                                             of products M N of the manifolds M were investigated. In the publications
                                             [36, 38] irreducible unitary representations of groups of diffeomorphisms asso-
                                             ciated with real-valued Poisson measures on products of real manifolds were
                                             studied.
                                                 This article is related with unitary representations of G′ associated with
                                             Poisson measures on GN and uses quasi-invariant measures on G from the
                                             previous works. Several groups are considered: (1) (a) diffeomorphisms and
                                             (b) loop groups of real manifolds, (2) (a) diffeomorphisms and (b) loop groups
                                             of non-Archimedean manifolds over local fields. Besides these four cases

                                                                                           1
further the fifth and the sixth cases are considered: for (3) (a) real and
(b) non-Archimedean groups of diffeomorphisms Dif f (M) representations
associated with Poisson measures on configuration spaces ΓM contained in
products of manifolds M N are investigated. The case (3) (a) for real locally
compact M was considered in [36, 38]. Here the cases of infinite-dimensional
Banach manifold M (3) (a), non-Archimdean locally compact and non-locally
compact Banach manifolds (3) (b) are investigated. For this quasi-invariant
measures on M relative to Dif f (M) from [20, 21] are considered. Henceforth
real-valued measures are considered. In §2 necessary Poisson measures are
considered, definitions and notations are given. In §3 irreducible unitary
representations are considered. Certainly not all results from [36, 38] can be
transferred onto the cases considered here, moreover, there were necessary
strong changes in many definitions, proofs and formulations of the theorems.
    It is necessary to note that the theory of representations of non-locally
compact groups differ substantially from that of locally compact groups.
For example, irreducible unitary representations of locally compact Abelian
groups are one-dimensional, that is, characters. But for non-locally compact
Abelian groups there are infinite-dimensional irreducible unitary representa-
tions, which are even regular representations. It was shown in [1, 10] that
there are infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces E and dense nuclear
additive subgroups E ′ such that E ′ are linear subspaces and quasi-invariant
measures µ on E relative to E ′ exist such that associated with them reg-
ular representations in the Hilbert space L2 (E, µ, C) are irreducible. The
existence of such irreducible representations is even despite of the fact that
projections µJ of µ on one-dimensional subspaces J are equivalent with the
Haar measures on J. This shows that non-locally compact case is more
complicated than it may be supposed at the first glance. Also for definite
groups G of diffeomorphisms and loops of definite real and non-Archimedean
manifolds there are quasi-invariant measures µ on G relative to dense sub-
groups G′ such that associated with them regular unitary representations
are irreducible [14, 18, 23, 24, 25]. Such difference is caused by the exis-
tence of C ∗ -algebras associated with the Haar measures on locally compact
groups [11], but no any C ∗ -algebra can be directly associated with a non-zero
quasi-invariant measure on a non-locally compact group relative to a dense
subgroup G′ . Certainly, results on irreducibility of regular representations of
infinite-dimensional topological groups G′ depend stronlgy on quasi-invariant
measures µ on G and a structure of G, where G′ is dense in G.

2.1. Note. Let X denotes a manifold M for a group of diffeomorphisms
G = G(M) or the group G itself, where M is the C ∞ -manifold over R or
an analytic manifold over a local field and G is the loop group or the diffeo-
morphisms group as in the cited in §1 papers. Classes of smoothness of the
groups G and G′ are considered to be not less than C 1 . The groups of dif-
feomorphisms G for the real C ∞ -manifold M are denoted Dif fβ,γ               t
                                                                                   (M) with
                                                                       ∞
∞ ≥ t ≥ 1, β ≥ 0, γ ≥ 0; the loop groups G for the real C -manifold N are
denoted (Lm N)γ,Y with m + 5 < γ ≤ ∞, also another classes of smoothness
and non-Archimedean groups and manifolds were considered (see theorem
3.4 [27] and also [6, 18, 23, 24, 21]). It was proved earlier, that G itself
is the C ∞ -manifold (in the case of the real group of diffeomorphisms for
finite-dimensional Riemann manifolds M see also [2, 6]). Moreover, in the
non-Archimedean case M and G have structures of the analytic manifolds
with clopen disjoint charts. Clearly, G itself is not locally compact, since
G considered as the manifold is infinite-dimensional over the corresponding
field. When X = M let us suppose, that X is the Banach non-compact man-
ifold. In the non-Archimedean case it has embedding into the Banach space
Z over the same local field L due to the partition of M into disjoint union
of balls, so an atlas of M is supposed to be analytic and it has automati-
cally foliated structure [22, 26]. In the real case it is supposed that M has a
foliated structure with finite-dimensional submanifolds Mn ⊂ Mn+1 for each
              S
n ∈ N and n∈N Mn is dense in M, where dimR Mn = kn < ∞ [21, 27, 30].
    We remind the definition of the configuration space from [36] and also
consider the ultrametric case of X. This means that a metric d in X satisfies
the ultrametric inequality d(x, y) ≤ max(d(x, z), d(y, z)) for each x, y, z ∈ X.
    Let K be a complete separable metric space with a metric d, that is, X is
a Polish space. In the ultrametric case this implies that its topological great
                                                                             P
inductive dimension is zero: Ind(K) = 0 [7]. Let dnK (x, y) := ni=1 d(xi , yi )
in the real case and d(x, y) := max1≤i≤n d(xi , yi ) in the non-Archimedean
case be a metric in K n , where x = (xi : i = 1, ..., n) ∈ K n , xi ∈ K.
Put K̃ n := (x ∈ K n : xi 6= xj for each i 6= j). Supply K̃ n with a
          n
metric δK   (x, y) := dnK (x, y)/[dnK (x, y) + dnK (x, (K̃ n )c ) + dnK (y, (K̃ n )c )] in the
                   n
real case and δK     (x, y) := dnK (x, y)/[max(dnK (x, y), dnK (x, (K̃ n )c ), d(y, (K̃ n)c )]
in the non-Archimedean case, where Ac := K n \ A for a subset A ⊂ K n .
Then (K̃ n , δKn
                 ) is the Polish space. Moreover, if (K, d) is ultrametric, then

                                              3
(K̃ n , δK
         n
           ) is ultrametric. Let also BK        n
                                                   denotes the collection of all n-point
                                           n
subsets of K. Then the metric δK is equivalent with the following metric
  (n)
dK (γ, γ ′ ) := inf σ∈Σn dnK ((x1 , ..., xn ), (x′σ(1) , ..., x′σ(n) )), where Σn is the sym-
metric group of (1, ..., n), σ ∈ Σn , σ : (1, ..., n) → (1, ..., n); γ, γ ′ ∈ BK                 n
                                                                                                   .
                                                                           n
For each subset A ⊂ K a number mapping NA : BK → No is defined
by the following formula: NA (γ) := card(γ ∩ A), where N := {1, 2, 3, ...},
                                               (n)
No := {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Evidently, dK is the ultrametric, if dnK is the ul-
                                                    n
trametric. It remains to show, that δK                   is the ultrametric for the ultra-
                                                                            n
metric space (K, d). For this we mention, that (i) δK                         (x, y) > 0, when
                    n                         n                   n
x 6= y, and δK (x, x) = 0. (ii) δK (x, y) = δK (y, x), since this symme-
try is true for dnK and for [∗] in the denumerator in the formula defining
 n                         n                     n             n
δK  . To prove (iii) δK      (x, y) ≤ max(δK       (x, z), δK    (z, y)) we consider the case
 n                n                                                          n             n
δK (x, z) ≥ δK (y, z), hence it is sufficient to show, that δK                 (x, y) ≤ δK   (x, z).
Let (a) dnK (x, z) ≥ max(dnK (z, (K̃ n )c ), dnK (x, (K̃ n )c )), then δK           n
                                                                                      (x, z) = 1,
           n             n                  n
hence δK     (x, y) ≤ δK   (x, z), since δK   (x, y) ≤ 1 for each x, y ∈ K̃ n . Let (b)
dK (x, (K̃ ) ) > max(dK (x, z), dK (z, (K̃ n )c )), then δK
  n          n c             n          n                            n
                                                                       (x, z) = dnK (x, z)/dnK (x, (K̃ n )c ) ≤
1. Since dnK (z, A) := inf a∈A dnK (z, a), then dnK (z, (K̃ n )c ) ≤ max(dnK (y, (K̃ n )c ), dnK (y, z)).
If dnK (x, z) < dnK (z, (K̃ n )c ) and dnK (x, y) ≤ dnK (x, z), then dnK (z, (K̃ n )c ) ≤
dnK (x, (K̃ n )c ). Hence dnK (x, y) max(dnK (x, z), dnK (x, (K̃ n )c ), dnK (z, (K̃ n )c )) ≤
dnK (x, z) max(dnK (x, y), dnK (x, (K̃ n )c ), dnK (y, (K̃ n )c )). With the help of (ii) the
remaining cases may be lightly written.
                                  n                                 n
     The Borel σ-field of BK         is denoted by Bf (BK             ). If < S, L, m > is the
measure space, then its completion relative to m is denoted Af (S, m), where
S is a set, L is a σ-algebra of subsets of S, m is a real non-negative σ-finite
measure on L. That is, the σ-algebra Af (S, m) contains all subsets A ⊂ B
of B ∈ L for which m(B) = 0. In the non-Archimedean case the valuation
group Γ′ L := {|x|L : 0 6= x ∈ L} of the local field L is discrete in (0, ∞),
hence subsets Uǫ (y) := {x ∈ K : d(x, y) < ǫ} are clopen (closed and open
simultaneously) in K = X. Therefore, in the non-Archimedean case lemmas
1.1 and 1.2 from [36] have the following stronger forms.
     2.2. Lemma. For an ultrametric space (X, d) from §2.1 if U is a clopen
set in X, then {γ : NU (γ) ≥ l} is also clopen in X for each l ∈ No .
     2.3. Lemma. For an ultrametric space (X, d) from §2.1 and each ǫ > 0
                       n
and each γ ∈ BX          there exists a clopen subset Oǫ (γ) which belongs to the
smallest σ-algebra B for which functions NB are measurable such that γ ∈
                    (n)
Oǫ (γ) ⊂ {γ ′ : dX (γ, γ ′ ) < ǫ}.


                                                4
    Proof. For γ = {x1 , ..., xn } take η ∈ Γ′ L such that ǫ > η > 0 and
                                                               T
Uηp−n (xi ) ∩ Uηp−n (xj ) = ∅ for each i 6= j. Put Oǫ (γ) := { ni=1 {γ ′ : card(γ ′ ∩
Uηp−n (xi )) ≥ 1}, where 1 < p ∈ ΓL , p−1 = |πL |L , B(L, 0, 1− ) = πL B(L, 0, 1),
B(Y, x, r) := {z ∈ Y : dY (x, z) ≤ r}, B(Y, y, r −) := {z ∈ Y : dY (y, z) < r}
for an ultrametric space Y with an ultrametric dY .
    2.4. Notes and definitions. Then theorems 1.1 and 1.2 from [36] are
also true for all cases considered here. For this we mention, that as usually let
        L
BK := ∞           n           0
           n=0 BK , where BK := {∅} is a singleton. Since X from §2.1 is not
compact, then there exists an increasing sequence of subsets Kn ⊂ X such
            S
that X = n Kn and Kn are Polish spaces in the induced topology from X.
Moreover, Kn can be chosen clopen in X in the non-Archimedean case. Then
the following space ΓX := {γ : γ ⊂ X and card(γ ∩ Kn ) < ∞ for each n} is
called the configuration space and it is isomorphic with the projective limit
                    n               n
pr − lim{BKn , πm     , N}, where πm  (γm ) = γn for each m > n and γn ∈ BKn . If
dn denotes the metric in BKn , then dn+1 |BKn = dn , since Kn ⊂ Kn+1 . Then
Q∞
  n=1 BKn =: Y in the Tychonoff product topology is metrizable, that induces
the metric in ΓX . Moreover, in the non-Archimedean case the metric ρ in Y
can be chosen satisfying the ultrametric inequality: ρ(x, y) := dn (xn , yn )p−n ,
where n = n(x, y) := min(xj 6=yj ) j, x = (xj : j ∈ N, xj ∈ BKj ).
    As it was proved in the papers cited in §1, on X from §2.1 there ex-
ist real measures m quasi-invariant relative to the left action of the cor-
responding group G′ such that m(Kn ) < ∞. In the case X = G, then
G′ is a dense subgroup in G. Quasi-invariance of m implies, that m are
non-atomic. Let K ∈ {Kn : n ∈ N}, then mK denotes the restriction
                         N
m|K . Then mnK := nj=1(mK )j is a measure on K n and hence on K̃ n , since
m are non-atomic, where (mK )j = mK for each j. Therefore, PK,m :=
               P
exp(−m(K)) ∞       n=0 mK,n /n! is a probability measure on Bf (BK ), where mK,0
                                                  0
is a probability measure on the singleton BK        , and mK,n are images of mnK
under the following mappings: pK : (x1 , ..., xn ) ∈ K̃ n → {x1 , ..., xn } ∈ BK
                                      n                                            n
                                                                                     .
It was shown in §1.2 [36] that such system of measures PK,n is consistent,
that is, πln PKl ,m = PKn ,m for each n ≤ l. This defines the unique measure
Pm on Bf (ΓX ), which is called the Poisson measure. For each n1 , .., nl ∈ No
and disjoint Borel subsets B1 , ..., Bl in X there is the following equality:
             T                                  Q
    (i) Pm ( lj=1 {γ : card(γ ∩ Bi ) = ni }) = li=1 m(Bi )ni exp(−m(Bi ))/ni !.
    The configuration space ΓX consists of γ ⊂ X such that card(γ∩Kn ) < ℵ0
for each n ∈ N. In the case of Dif f t (M) this means that we need to
consider such elements g of this group for which supp(g) ⊂ Kn for some

                                          5
n ∈ N, for example, a subgroup with supports of its elements contained
in the corresponding finite unions of charts, where supp(g) := cl{x ∈ M :
g(x) 6= x}. Such subgroups are not Banach manifolds and they are denoted
by Dif fl (M). In the case of X = G the initial configuration space ΓX is not
preserved by G′ , since there are g ∈ G′ such that gKn is not contained in any
Km , because supp(Lh ) = G for each e 6= h ∈ G′ , where Lh g := hg denotes
the left shift in G for g, h ∈ G.
      Actually it is necessary to use more general construction in the case of
                           S
X = G. Let Γ̃X := [ g∈G′ gΓX ]/R, where R is an equivalence relation:
                                                        S
(gγ)R(g ′γ ′ ) if and only if (gγ) = (g ′ γ ′ ), where [ g∈G′ gΓX ] is considered as
the subset of X N . The group G′ is separable, hence there exists a countable
dense subset {gj : j ∈ N}. To each element g ∈ G′ there corresponds a sub-
sequence {gjn : n ∈ N} converging to g in G′ . Hence each gγ is completely
characterised by the corresponding subsequence {gjn γ : n ∈ N}. There-
fore, Γ̃X has the embedding into X N as the closed subset, since the family
of mappings {Lgj : j ∈ N} separates points of X N [7]. Hence Γ̃X is also
metrizable and complete. The manifold Γ̃X for each its point has a neigh-
bourhood diffeomorphic with the corresponding open subset of ΓX , since for
each Kn there exist a neighbourhood U ′ n of e in G′ and m > n such that
U ′ n Kn ⊂ Km . A choice of such sequence Kn ⊂ Int(Kn+1 ) with canonical
closed subsets Kn is given independently in §2.9. The manifold Γ̃X is para-
compact, consequently, it has a locally finite covering {Sl : l ∈ N}, where
Sl are open in Γ̃X and diffeomorphic with the corresponding open subsets
Ql of ΓX for which Pm (Ql ) < ∞, ζl : Sl → Ql denote such diffeomorphisms.
This means that the Poisson measure Pm on ΓX induces the correspond-
ing σ-additive σ-finite quasi-invariant relative to G′ measure µ on Γ̃X such
                    P
that µ(E) := C l Pm (ζl (E ∩ Sl ))2−l which is also denoted by Pm , where
E ∈ Bf (Γ̃X ), a constant C > 0 is chosen such that µ(Γ̃X ) = 1. Therefore,
Pm on Γ̃X is the probability measure as also for the case ΓM for dimL M < ∞.
This gives possibility to consider the case X = G as well as the case X = M
for groups of diffeomorphisms Dif f t (M) of class C t with 1 ≤ t ≤ ∞, which
have structure of Banach manifolds from the papers cited above.
      If the manifold M is locally compact and each Kn is chosen to be canon-
ical closed compact subset, then for Dif f t (M) the configuration spaces ΓM
and Γ̃M coincide. Indeed, if γ ∈ ΓM , then card(γ ∩ Kn ) < ℵ0 for each
n ∈ N. Each subset Kn is compact and canonically closed, hence is sequen-


                                         6
tially compact [7]. This means that if card((gγ) ∩ Kl ) = ℵ0 for some l ∈ N
and g ∈ Dif f t (M), then {gγj : j ∈ N} contains a convergent subsequence
in Kl . But {γj : j ∈ N} = γ is the disrete subset of M, hence g −1 is not
continuous, since {gγj : j ∈ N} is not closed in M. This contradicts sup-
position g ∈ Dif f t (M), consequently, gγ ∈ ΓM for each g ∈ Dif f t (M) for
locally compact M and canonical closed compact subsets Kn in M. There-
       S
fore, g∈Dif f t (M ) gΓM = ΓM , since gΓM ⊂ ΓM for each g ∈ Dif f t (M) and
eΓM = ΓM , consequently, Γ̃M = ΓM .
                                                                 S
     If M is not locally compact, for example, M \ MR = ∞          j=1 Ωj , where
Ωj are disjoint open subsets of M, MR := {x ∈ M : dM (x, x0 ) ≤ R},
0 < R < ∞, x0 is a fixed point in M and dM is a metric in M, then there
exists g ∈ Dif f ∞ (M) with supp(g) bounded in M and a bounded infinite
sequence of γj ∈ M \ MR which is discrete in M, that is, cl{γj : j ∈ N} =
{γj : j ∈ N}, such that card((gγ) ∩ Kn ) = ℵ0 for some canonically closed
Kn in M, since each Kn is not locally compact, when dimL M = ∞, where
L is the corresponding field either R or the local field. Hence in this case
Γ̃M 6= ΓM .
     If X = G, then in view of the choice of Kn in §2.9 that to fulfil demands
on the measure m, there exists g ∈ G′ and n ∈ N such that gKn is not
contained in each Kl , where l ∈ N. This g can be chosen by induction, since
Kl are not locally compact for each l and G is not locally compact. Therefore,
there exists a discrete infinite sequence γ in gKn such that card(γ ∩ Kl ) < ℵ0
for each l ∈ N. But γ ∈ ΓG and g −1 ∈ G′ and g −1γ ∈ Γ̃G \ ΓG , since
card((g −1γ) ∩ Kn ) = ℵ0 . Hence Γ̃G 6= ΓG in this case also.
     The group G′ and X and ΓX have structures of the C ∞ -manifolds, since
X is the C ∞ -manifold. Therefore, Γ̃X is the C ∞ -manifold also. In the non-
Archimedean case M, G′ , G and hence ΓX and Γ̃X are analytic manifolds
with disjoint clopen charts, since Γ′ L is discrete in (0, ∞) and ΓX and Γ̃X are
infinite-dimensional over L [22].
     It is necessary to note, that for X = G the dense subgroup G′ acts by
the left shifts Lh : G → G as the diffeomorphism for each h ∈ G′ , where G
is either the loop group or the diffeomorphisms group. Therefore, lemmas
2.1, 2.2 and theorems 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 from [36] are applicable to the cases
considered here, since ΓX produces charts for Γ̃X and Pm on ΓX induces Pm on
Γ̃X . Theorem 2.3 from [36] can be applied to the real and non-Archimedean
cases of X = M.


                                       7
     2.5. Definition. (see [9] §19.3.) Let G′ be a group acting from the
left on the measure space < X, L, m >. Then < X, L, m > is called a measure
G′ -transformation space if (i) xW ∈ L whenever x ∈ G′ and W ∈ L, and (ii)
m(xW ) = 0 whenever x ∈ G′ , W ∈ L and m(W ) = 0.
     2.6. Note. For the considered here cases and Bf (X) ⊂ L conditions of
definition 2.5 are fulfilled for the quasi-invariant measure m on X relative to
G′ .
     2.7. Definition. The measure G′ -transformation space < S, L, m > is
ergodic under G′ if, whenever, V, W ∈ L with m(V )m(W ) 6= 0, there exists
x ∈ G′ such that m(xV ∩ W ) 6= 0.
     2.8. Note. It was proved in [18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25] that m on X is
ergodic under G′ for the considered here cases (1 − 3), since m is quasi-
invariant relative to G′ . In cases (1, 2) at first m was constructed on a
neighbourhood W of e in G. But theorem 2.3 from [36] can not be applied
to the cases X = G for the probability measure m on X, since in view of the
construction of the Gaussian measure m on G there are ǫ > 0 and n ∈ N
such that for Reach ψ ∈ G′ with ψ(Kn ) ∩ Kn = ∅ the following integral is
rather large: G |ρ1/2                                    ψ            −1
                      m (ψ, x) − 1|m(dx) > ǫ, where m (E) := m(ψ E) for
                                       ψ
each E ∈ Af (X, m), ρm (ψ, x) := m (dx)/m(dx).
     There are locally finite coverings {gj Wj : j ∈ No } of G and {gj Wj′ :
j ∈ No } of G′ , since G and G′ are paracompact spaces relative to their
own topologies τ and τ ′ respectively and G′ is dense in G, where W0 = W ,
Wj ⊂ W for each j, W ′ ⊂ W ∩ G′ , W0′ = W ′ , Wj′ ⊂ W ′ for each j, gj ∈ G′
for each j, g0 = e, Wj are open in G and Wj′ are open in G′ . Analogously for
the pair G′ and X = M in cases (3)(a, b). Then m on W can be extended as
a σ-finite measure on Bf (G) by the formula:
                   P         −1
     (i) m(V ) := ∞   j=0 m(gj (V ∩ gj Wj )), since 0 < m(W ) < ∞. The group
G is not locally compact, hence m(G) = ∞. Using analogous procedure
with a locally finite covering {gj Wj : j ∈ No } with Wj open in M and a
neighbourhood W of a marked point x0 ∈ M without relation between W ′
and W we get a σ-finite measure m on M for non-locally compact manifold
M with m(M) = ∞. We choose in these cases m(Kn ) < ∞ for each n ∈ N.
                                                                S
As follows from the cited papers it is possible to choose Kn ⊂ nj=0 gj Wj and
m such that
     (ii) for each ǫ > 0 and each nR∈ N there exists ψ ∈ G′ such that ψ(Kn ) ∩
                 S
Kn = ∅ and n Kn = X and X |ρ1/2                        2
                                         m (ψ, x) − 1| m(dx) < ǫ. Then it is
proved below in theorem 2.9 that such m exists and Pm on Γ̃X is ergodic.

                                      8
Henceforth, such σ-finite measures m on X are used with m(X) = ∞, since
for m(X) = 1 the corresponding measures Pm are not ergodic (see note after
definiton 1 in §2 [36]).
    2.9. Theorem. There exist quasi-invariant σ-finite measures m on X
relative to the groups G′ with m(X) = ∞ satisfying condition (ii) from §2.8.
For such m the Poisson measure Pm on Γ̃X is ergodic .
    Proof. To prove Pm is ergodic on ΓX we use the fact, that m is ergodic
on X. The measure space < S, L, m > is said to have property (P ) if,
for any locally m-measurable subset W of S such that xW ⊖ W is locally
m-null for each x ∈ G′ , either W is locally m-null or S \ W is locally m-
null. The measure space < S, L, m > is called parabounded if there exists a
pairwise disjoint subfamily W of L such that (i) for each A ∈ L, {B ∈ W :
                                        S
A∩B 6= ∅} is countable, and (ii) X \ W ∈W W is locally m-null. It was proved
in proposition 19.5 [9] that if < S, L, m > is ergodic it has property (P ).
Conversely, if < S, L, m > has property (P ) and is parabounded, it is ergodic.
                                                                          n
The space ΓX is isomorphic with the projective limit pr − lim{BKn , πm      , N},
                                Q
which is the closed subset in n BKn . The latter is the Polish space, hence
Γ̃X is the Polish space [7]. The measure spaces < X, Af (X, m), m > and
< Γ̃X , Af (Γ̃X , Pm ), Pm > are parabounded, since X and Γ̃X are the Polish
spaces and hence are the Radon spaces (see chapter 1 in [5]), that is, the class
of compact subsets approximates from below the corresponding measures
m|Kn and Pm . Therefore, it remains to show, that < Γ̃X , Af (Γ̃X , Pm ), Pm >
has property (P ). But this follows from theorem 2.3 [36] and §2.8, if to
show that condition 2.8 (ii) is fulfilled for m and U ′ n Kn ⊂ Int(Kn+1 ) for the
corresponding Kn in X and neighbourhoods U ′ n of e in G′ , since there are
the local diffeomorphisms ζl : Sl → Ql from §2.4 and Pm and m are σ-finite
measures. In this situation integral equalities and inequalities from the proof
of theorem 2.3 [36] are transferable onto the case of Γ̃X considered here.
    For the construction of such m take it at first on an open subset U ⊂ X
such that W is sufficiently small: W ′ W ⊂ U. In the case of G = X in
addition let e ∈ U and U −1 = U, W −1 = W , W ′−1 = W ′ (see references
in §2.8). The quasi-invariance factor ρm (x, y) is continuos on W ′ × W and
ρm (e, y) = 1, where ρm (x, y) := mx (dy)/m(dy), mx (A) := m(x−1 A) for each
x ∈ G′ and A ∈ Af (W, m). Take open subsets W0 ⊂ W and W0′ ⊂ W ′ for
which |ρm (x, y) − 1| < 1 for each (x, y) ∈ W0′ × W0 .
    The measure m is regular and approximated from above by the class of
open subsets [5, 9]. Therefore, it is possible to choose by induction open

                                       9
subsets Wj ⊂ W0 and e ∈ Wj′ ⊂ W0′ and a sequence of elements gj ∈ G′
                             Sj−1
such that m(gj−1 (gj Wj ∩ [ i=1   gi Wi ])) < 2−j and |ρw (x, y) − 1| < 2−j on
gj Wj′ × gj Wj , where w is a measure on Bf (gj Wj ) defined by the following
formula w(gj A) := m(A) for each A ∈ Bf (Wj ), g0 = e. Then m on Bf (X) is
defined by formula 2.8(i) and certainly has the extension m onto Af (X, m).
      The measure m is induced from the corresponding measure λ on the
Banach space Y due to the local diffeomorphism A : U → V , where V is an
open neighbourhood of 0 in Y and U is open in X. From the quasi-invariance
of λ relative to shifts from a dense subspace Y ′ it follows a property:
      (α) for each Borel subset E ⊂ Y which is a C 1 -submanifold in Y of
codimension 1 in Y (over the field R or the non-Archimedean local field)
such that Ty E is not subset of Y ′ for each y ∈ E it follows that λ(E) = 0,
since λ is the quasi-invariant non-negative σ-additive and σ-finite measure.
In particular, for finite-dimensional X = M over the corresponding field the
space Y is finite-dimensional and λ can be taken as the Haar measure on
Y (in the real case it concides with the Lebesgue measure). For infinite-
dimensional real X, particularly for X = G, the measure λ can be taken
Gaussian. For infinite-dimensional X over the local field the wider class of
measures λ was constructed in the papers cited in §1. Then we choose (take)
                                  S
by induction a sequence Kn ⊂ ni=0 gi Wi satisfying the following conditions
                                          S
U ′ n Kn ⊂ Int(Kn+1 ) for each n with n Kn = X and m(Kn \ Int(Kn )) = 0
and Kn are canonical closed subsets, that is, cl(Int(Kn )) = Kn , since m is
quasi-invariant and has not any atoms and due to property (α) of λ, where
cl(A) denotes the closure of a subset A ⊂ X in X, Int(A) denotes the interior
of A in X, U ′ n are the corresponding (open) neighbourhoods of e in G′ such
that U ′ n ⊂ W ′ . The space X is Polish, hence each Kn is the Polish topological
subspace [7]. Certainly, in the non-Archimedean cases each Kn can be chosen
clopen (closed and open) in X, that is, Int(Kn ) = Kn = cl(Kn ), since the
base of the topology of X consists of clopen subsets. Since X is not locally
compact, then there exists the sequence {Kn : n ∈ N} fulfilling condition
2.8(ii).
      2.10. Note. In cases (3)(a, b) for X = M and G′ = Dif f t (M) in
addition we have the following.
      2.11. Definition. Let G′ Kn := {ψ ∈ G′ : ψ|Knc = id} and let f be a
symmetric measurable function defined on K̃nl , where l ∈ N, Ac := X \ A for
                                                          S
a subset A in X, Kn are canonical closed subsets with n Kn = X and Kn ⊂


                                       10
Kn+1 and m(Kn \Int(Kn )) = 0 for each n ∈ N. In the non-Archimedean case
let also Kn be clopen in M, which automatically implies Kn \ Int(Kn ) = ∅.
The measure m is called G′ lKn -ergodic, if f is constant modulo null sets, then
f (x1 , ..., xl ) = f (ψ(x1 ), ..., ψ(xl )) for mlKn -a.e x = (x1 , ..., xl ) for all ψ ∈ G′ .
    2.12. Theorem. If for each n the measure m is G′ lKn -ergodic for some
N ≥ n and all l, then Pm is G′ -ergodic.
    Proof. As it was shown in papers [18, 21, 27, 29, 30] the subgroups G′ Kn
are correctly defined for canonical closed subsets Kn in M = X, G′ Kn ⊂ G′
for each n, since from ψ|Knc = id it follows, that ψ|cl(Knc ) = id. The rest of the
proof is as in the proof of theorem 2.4 [36], which can be applied locally and
then with the help of the local diffeomorphisms ζl : Sl → Ql is extendable
onto the case of Γ̃X considered here, since G′ lKN K̃Nl = K̃Nl and for the measure
                                                                             R
ν(A) := Pm (E ∩ A) for each A ∈ Bf (Γ̃X ) we have ν(B) = 0∞ Pcm (B)λ(dc)
for each B ∈ Bf (ΓX ), where c ≥ 0 and λ is a suitable Borel measure on
[0, ∞). From Pm (ζl (A ∩ Sl )) = 0 for each l it follows, that Pm (A) = 0. Thus
if λ({1}) > 0, then Pm (A) = 0; if λ({1}) = 0, then Pm (Ac ) = 0, where A is
a Pm -measurable subset of Γ̃X for which Pm (A △ ψ −1 A) = 0 for all ψ ∈ G′ ,
where A △ B := (A \ B) ∪ (B \ A)).
    2.13. Note. From theorem 2.12 it can be deduced in another way, than
it was done in theorem 2.9, that Pm on Γ̃X is G′ -ergodic in cases (3)(a, b)
for X = M, when m and Kn are chosen in accordance with §2.8 and §2.11.
The proof of this is analogous to that of theorem 2.5 [36], since m is ergodic
and quasi-invariant with the continuous quasi-invariance factor ρm (ψ, x) on
G′ × X, m(X) = ∞ and m(Kn \ Int(Kn )) = 0, since due to §2.4 there are
the local diffeomorphisms ζl : Sl → Ql and Dif f t (X; K)K̃ l = K̃ l for each
canonical closed subset K in X, where Dif f t (X; K) := {f ∈ Dif f t (X) :
f |K c = id}.
    2.14. Lemma. Let Y be a canonically closed subset in X, Y ⊂ Kn for
some n ∈ N. Suppose that µ is a quasi-invariant measure on Γ̃X relative to
G′ = Dif f t (X) for a C ∞ -manifold X = M (in the non-Archimedean case
an analytic manifold M) and µn be a restriction of µ on BYn × Γ̃X\Y and
µ′n and µ”n be projections of µn on BYn and Γ̃X\Y respectively. Then µn is
equivalent with µ′n × µ”n . In the non-Archimedean case this is also true for
Y clopen in X.
    Proof. In view of §2.9 m(Y \ Int(Y )) = 0. The group Dif f t (X; X \ Y )
is a closed subgroup of Dif f t (X), hence Γ̃X\Y = (Dif f t (X; X \ Y )ΓX )/R


                                             11
is a C ∞ -submanifold of Γ̃X (see also §2.4). The measures µ′n × µ”n with µn
are equivalent if and only if µ and µ′ × µ” are equivalent, since µ is quasi-
invariant relative to G′ and non-atomic, where µ′ is a projection of µ|BY ×Γ̃X\Y
on BY and µ” is a projection of µ on Γ̃X\Y . On the other hand, G′ BX  n
                                                                         = BXn

for each n ∈ N and G′ Γ̃X = Γ̃X , also Dif f t (X; X \ Y )Γ̃X\Y = Γ̃X\Y . On
the other hand, BYn × Γ̃X\Y is the Borel subset of Γ̃X , since BYn is the Borel
subset of ΓX . For the rest of the proof are necessary two propositions.
    2.15. Proposition. In the group Dif f t (Int(Y )) there exists a countable
family of one-parameter subgroups Gl such that generated by them group J ⊂
Dif f t (Y ) acts transitively on BYn .
    Proof. For Dif f t (Int(Y )) one-parameter subgroups can be chosen as in
proposition 2.1 [38] with the help of [6] and theorems about existence of one-
parameter subgroups of Dif f t (Y ) for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds
M from [17, 21, 26, 27], where one-parameter subgroups are real for real M
and g b with b ∈ L for M over the local field L such that g a g b = g a+b for
each a, b ∈ L. In the non-Archimedean case one-parameter subgroups can
aslo be indexed by b ∈ B(L, 0, 1), where B(S, x, r) := {y ∈ S : dS (x, y) ≤ r}
denotes a ball in a metric space S with a metric dS and a point x ∈ S. This
is possible, since M and Tx M are separable spaces for each x ∈ M and using
countable atlas At(M) = {(Uj , φj ) : j} of M and considering one-parameter
subgroups with supp(g b) ⊂ Uj for each b ∈ L for the corresponding chart Uj ,
where either L = R or L is the local field, Uj are open in M and φj : Uj → Vj
are diffeomorphisms, Vj are open in the corresponding Banach space.
    2.16. Proposition. Let L or may be B(L, 0, 1) also in the non-Archimedean
case acts measurably in a measure space (M, Bf (M), µ) such that µ is quasi-
invarint relative to the action of L or B(L, 0, 1) on M, where M is a C ∞ -
manifold (analytic in the non-Archimedean case) and µ is induced by a quasi-
invariant non-negative σ-additive and σ-finite measure η relative to shifts
from a dense subspace Z ′ and η is on the Borel field Bf (Z) of the separa-
ble Banach space Z over a field L which is either L = R or a local field
such that Z = Tx M for each x ∈ M. Suppose that a partition ζ of M
is invariant by mod(µ) relative to the action of L or B(L, 0, 1) on M and
projections of η onto one-dimensional over L subspaces are equivalent with
the non-negative Haar measure λ on L. Then for µ-almost each C ∈ ζ the
conditional measures µC are quasi-invariant relative to the action of L or
B(L, 0, 1) respectively.


                                      12
    Proof. The proof is almost the same as in proposition 2.2 [38] with the
substitution of R onto L or may be B(L, 0, 1) in the non-Archimedean case
and using the Haar measure λ on a locally compact subgroup S of L with
λ(L \ S) = 0 or λ(B(L, 0, 1) \ S) = 0, which implies S = L or S = B(L, 0, 1)
respectively by the A. Weil theorem, since each quasi-invariant measure on a
locally compact group (relative to its action on itself) is equivalent with the
Haar measure [4].
    Continuation of the proof of lemma 2.14. In view of proposition
                                                                n
2.15 there exists a subgroup J which acts transitively on BInt(Y     ) . In view of
proposition 2.16 from an isomorphism of one-parameter subgroup Gl with L
or B(L, 0, 1) for µ”n -a.e. configurations γ ∈ Γ̃X\Y the conditional measure
µγn on BYn is quasi-invariant relative to each one-parameter subgroup Gl ,
                                                                           S
hence realtive to the minimal subgroup J of Dif f t (X) generated by ∞       l=1 Gl .
The measure µγn on BYn induces the measure η on Tγ n BYn for each γ n ∈
BYn . This measure η is completely characterised by its finite-dimensional
projections ηn onto subspaces Fn such that Fn ⊂ Fn+1 for each n ∈ N and
S                        n
  n Fn is dense in Tγ n BY (see about weak distributions [28, 37]). It is supposed
that the manifold M has the foliated structure such that Mn ⊂ Mn+1 and
                                           S
dimL Mn = kn < ∞ for each n ∈ N and n∈N Mn is dense in M. Theorefore,
to µγn there corresponds a family of measures η̃n on Mn with the help of a
locally finite coverings and the exponential mapping exp : M̃ → M from the
neighbourhood T̃ M of M in T M onto M such that expx : Vx → Wx are local
diffeomorphisms of open subsets Vx in Tx M and Wx in M with x ∈ M. A
measure η̃n is quasi-invariant relative to Jn := {g ∈ J : gM \Mn = id}. The
manifold Mn is locally compact, hence η̃n is equivalent with the Riemann
volume element on Mn in the real case and with the restriction of the Haar
measure from Lkn onto Mn in the non-Archimedean case, since in the latter
case Mn is embeddable into Lkn due to a partition of Mn into a disjoint
union of balls. In view of the Kakutani theorem II.4.1 [5] µn is equivalent
with µ′n × µ”n , since a finite measure ζ on Bf (A × B) is equivalent with the
direct product ζA × ζB , where ζA and ζB are projections of ζ on Hausdorff
topological spaces A and B respectively.

3     Unitary representations associated with the
      Poisson measures.
3.1. Definitions and notes. Let H := L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) be the standard
Hilbert space of Requivalence classes of measurable functions f : Γ̃X → C for
which kf k2H := Γ̃X |f (x)|2Pm (dx) < ∞, where Pm is the Poisson measure
given in §2.4. Then consider the following representation:
                             1/2
    (i) Um (ψ)f (γ) := ρPm (ψ, γ)f (ψ −1(γ)),
where ρPm (ψ, γ) := Pmψ (dγ)/Pm (dγ), γ ∈ Γ̃X , f ∈ H, ψ ∈ G′ , mψ (E) :=
m(ψ −1 E) for each E ∈ Af (X, m). That is, Um : G′ → U(H), where U(H) is
the unitary group of the Hilbert space H. The topology of U(H) is induced by
the operator norm in the space L(H) of bounded linear operators S : H → H,
d(A, B) := d(B −1 A, I) := kB −1 A − IkL(H) is the metric in U(H), where
A, B ∈ U(H), I denotes the unit operator on H.
    In cases (3)(a, b) of X = M and G′ = Dif f t (M) these representations can
be generalised with the help of the symmetric group Σn representations in
the following manner, where Σn is the group of all (bijective) automorphisms
σ of the set {1, 2, .., n} with n ∈ N and Σ∞ is the symmetric group of N
(that is, of all bijective mappings of N). Let q : Σn → U(W ) be the unitary
representation of Σn , where W is the Hilbert space, or q : Σ∞ → U(W ).
                 n
Then sn : BX         → X̃ n or s : Γ̃X → X̃ ∞ produces a mapping σ : G′ × BX          n
                                                                                          →
                 ′              ∞                         −1          −1
Σn or s : G × Γ̃X → Σ by the formula sn (ψ (γ)) = ψ (sn (γ))σ(ψ, γ)
or s(ψ −1 (γ)) = ψ −1 (s(γ))σ(ψ, γ), where sn is a measurable cross-section of
pn : X̃ n → BX     n
                     and s of p : X̃ ∞ → Γ̃X such that pn (x1 , ..., xn ) = {x1 , ..., xn }
for n ∈ N or p(x1 , x2 , ...) = {x1 , x2 , ...}, (x1 , ..., xn )σ = (xσ(1) , ..., xσ(n) ) or
(x1 , x2 , ...)σ = (xσ(1) , xσ(2) , ...) respectively. Then with each pair (n, q) or
(∞, q) is associated a unitary representation of G′ in L2 (BX         n
                                                                         , mn , W ) or in
  2
L (Γ̃X , Pm , W ) respectively such that
                              1/2
    (ii) Vmq (ψ)f (γ) := ρmn (ψ, γ)q(σ(ψ, γ))f (ψ −1(γ)), or
                            1/2
    (iii) Vmq (ψ)f (γ) := ρPm (ψ, γ)q(σ(ψ, γ))f (ψ −1(γ)),
where mn is the image measure of the direct product of n copies of m by the
map pn and ρmn (ψ, γ) := (mn )ψ (dγ)/mn (dγ), (mn )ψ (E) := mn (ψ −1 E) for
                   n
each E ∈ Af (BX      , mn ), ψ ∈ G′ , γ ∈ BXn
                                              . As usually the space L2 (BX
                                                                          n
                                                                            , mn , W )
                                                                              n
denotes the space of equivalence   R
                                       classes of measurable functions f : BX   →W
for which kf kL2 (Bn ,mn ,W ) := Bn kf (x)kW m (dx) < ∞. Then Um and Vmq

                               q
define new representation Um      := Um ⊗ Vmq .
    3.2. Note. For the group of diffeomorphisms of the real finite-dimensional
manifold M such representations were defined in [38], where it was mentioned
that the representations Vmq are in a weak respect analogous to the construc-
tion of H. Weyl for the classical Lie groups. For W = {0} and q = I the
representation Vmq is evidently irreducible [12, 21, 20], hence as in theorem
1.1 [38] for the considered here cases we have, that (i) if q is the irreducible
representation of Σn with n ∈ N, then Vmq is the irreducible representation
of the diffeomorphism group G′ ; (ii) Vmq1 and Vmq2 are equivalent if and only
if n1 = n2 and q1 of Sn1 is equivalent to q2 of Sn2 .
    3.3. Note. Let X = M be a finite-dimensional over a local field
K non-compact manifold embedded as an open subset into Kn . Suppose
that m is the restriction m = λ|M of the Haar measure λ on Kn nor-
malised by λ(B(Kn , 0, 1)) = 1. Let Dif f t (X, m) denotes the subgroup of
G′ = Dif f t (X) of the non-Archimedean class of smoothness C t such that
ρm (ψ, x) = 1 for each ψ ∈ Dif f t (X, m) and x ∈ X, where 1 ≤ t ≤ ∞.
    3.4. Theorem. Let X and Dif f t (X, m) be the same as in §3.3. Then
the restriction of the representation Vmq from §3.1 on Dif f t (X, m) is irre-
ducible.
    Proof. For finite-dimensional M over the local field L there is the equal-
ity Γ̃M = ΓM due to §2.4. Since diffeomorphisms ψ with locally linear (ψ−id)
are contained in Dif f t (X, m), for example, when kψ − idkC 1 (X→Kn ) < 1.
Then for each pairwise distinct points x1 , ..., xn ∈ X there are neighbour-
hoods O1 , ..., On such that their closures Ōj are C 1 -diffeomorphic with balls
in Kn and Ōi ∩ Ōj = ∅ for each i 6= j and m(O1 ) = ... = m(On ). Moreover,
for each transposition (k1 , ..., kn ) of (1, ..., n) there exists a diffeomorphism
ψ ∈ Dif f t (X, m) with ψ(Ōi ) = Ōki . Such ψ exists due to partition of X
into disjoint union of sufficiently small clopen balls Ul such that Ōj = Oj
for each j = 1, ..., n and for each j there exists lj such that Oj = Ulj while
ψ(Oj ) = Okj and diameters of all Oj are equal to each other. Having ψ on
Sn
  j=1 Oj =: E, it is possible to extend ψ as id on X \ E.
    Let now Y be a clopen compact submanifold ofR X and consider sub-
space L̃2 (Y, m, C) consisting of f ∈ L2 (Y, m, C) with Y f (y)m(dy) = 0. Let
H1 6= {0} be an invariant subspace of L̃2 (Y, m, C) relative to the regular
representation (Uψ f )(y) := f (ψ −1 y) of Dif f t (Y, m). For each ball O in Y
there exists f ∈ H1 such that f 6= 0 and supp(f ) ⊂ O. Further analogously
to the proof of lemma 2 from §1 [38] we get, that such representation of

                                       15
Dif f t (Y, m) is irreducible. If Oj with j = 1, ..., n are clopen balls in X, then
a subgroup G0 (O1 , ..., On ; X) of elements ψ ∈ Dif f t (X, m) with ψ|Oj = id
                                                N
for each j = 1, ..., n acts trivially on ( nj=1 L2 (Oj , m, C)) ⊗ W . Then quite
analogously to the proof of theorem 1.2 [38] we get the statement of this
theorem.
     3.5. Note. Let Ñn := {a = (i1 , ..., in )|ij 6= is for each i 6= s},
                                                                P
l2 (Ñn , W ) := {φ|φ : Ñn → W, such that kφk2 := a∈Ñn kφ(a)k2W < ∞}
and H q := {φ ∈ l2 (Ñn , W )|φ(iσ(1) , ..., iσ(n) ) = q −1 (σ)φ(i1 , ..., in )) for all
σ ∈ Sn }, where q is a unitary representation of Sn in a Hilbert space W .
In the case X = M the representation q and W may be non-trivial with
n ∈ N, for X = G and G′ acting on X we set q = I and W = {0} and
n = 0. We denote by Σ∞ the set of all permutations (bijections) of N
and put σa = (σ(i1 ), ..., σ(in )) for σ ∈ Σ∞ and a ∈ Ñn . Then a function
σ : G′ × Γ̃X → Σ∞ is defined by the formula s(ψ −1 (γ)) = ψ −1 (s(γ))σ(ψ, γ),
where s is a measurable (admissible) cross section of the map p : X̃ ∞ ∋
(x1 , x2 , ...) 7→ {x1 , x2 , ...} ∈ Γ̃X posessing the following property:
     (α) if card(γ ∩ X1 ) = k1 , card(γ ∩ (K2 \ K1 )) = k2 ,..., card(γ ∩ (Kn \
Kn−1 )) = kn ,..., then the first k1 elements of s(γ) are in γ ∩ K1 , the next k2
of s(γ) are in γ ∩ (K2 \ K1 ) and so on. For X = M finite-dimensional over
L and ψ ∈ Dif f t (Kl ) := {ψ ∈ Dif f (X) : ψ|Klc = id}, then σ(ψ, γ) ∈ Σr ,
so H q is non-trivial in general for this case, where Klc := X \ Kl . The latter
property in general may be untrue for infinite-dimensional manifold M or
for X = G and G′ acting on G, therefore, we consider q = I and n = 0 and
W = {0} for X = G. For infinite-dimensional X = M over L let us drop
condition (α) and let q be a representation of Σ∞ in U(H q ), where H q is
defined analogously with the H q for n but with the substitution of n onto ∞
and Σn onto Σ∞ .
     Then there exists the following unitary representation of G′ in the space
L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) ⊗ H q (which is isomorphic with L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) for X = G):
             q                     1/2
     (i) Um    (ψ)F (γ, a) := ρPm (ψ, γ)F (ψ −1(γ), σ(ψ, γ)−1 a) (see ρPm in §3.1).
     3.6. Theorem. The representations from §3.1 and §3.5 in the case
X = G are equivalent, in the case of finite-dimensional X = M over L
for the group of diffeomorphism acting on M the representation Um ⊗ Vmq is
                       q
equivalent with Un◦m       , where q is a representation of the symmetric group Σn .
     Proof. In the case X = G this follows from their definitions, that is, Um
                                                      q
given by formula 3.1.(i) is equivalent with Um          , since q = I and W is trivial.


                                          16
In the case of the C ∞ -manifold X = M, which is finite-dimensional over R,
it was proved in theorem 3.2 [38]. In the non-Archimedean case the proof
is analogous, but instead of differentiabilty of measures their pseudodiffer-
entiability should be considered as in [28]. In view of proposition 2.16 the
quasi-invariant measure m on M relative to Dif f t (M) is equivalent with the
restriction of the Haar measure λ for Lk on M, that is, λ|M ∼ m, where
M is embedded into Lk for the corresponding local field L. In view of §2.4
ΓM = Γ̃M for locally compact M. Therefore, convolutions of measures µ1 ∗µ2
are correctly defined on ΓM as an image of the product measure µ1 × µ2 on
ΓM × ΓM relative to a mapping (γ1 , γ2 ) 7→ (γ1 ∪ γ2 ) from ΓM × ΓM to ΓM .
                                                                 n
Then n ◦ µ denotes µ ∗ mn , where mn is a measure on BX            corresponding to
the restriction Pm |BXn , n1 ◦ (n2 ◦ µ) is equivalent with (n1 + n2 ) ◦ µ for each
n1 and n2 ∈ N, 0 ◦ µ is equivalent with µ. For each ψ ∈ Dif f t (M) we have
ψ(µ1 ∗ µ2 ) = (ψµ1 ) ∗ (ψµ2 ), where t ≥ 1 and ψµ := µψ , µψ (E) := µ(ψ −1 E)
for each E ∈ Bf (M). Therefore, for each pair µ1 and µ2 of quasi-invariant
measures, their convolution is also a quasi-invaraint measure. Then all nec-
essary results from §2.3-5 of [38] can lightly be transferred onto the non-
Archimedean case.
    3.7. Note. In the papers [16, 27, 30, 35] quasi-invariant measures
on the diffeomorphisms groups of real Banach manifolds were constructed.
Purely Gaussian measures quasi-invariant relative to dense subgroups were
constructed in the cases of Euclidean and Hilbertian at infinity manifolds
and also for definite closed subgroups Dif fkt (M) := {f ∈ Dif f t (M) :
(∆j f )|∂M = (∆j )id|∂M for each j = 0, 1, ..., k} and Diflt (M) := {f ∈
Dif f t (M) : (∂νj f )|∂M = (∂νj id)|∂M for each j = 0, 1, ..., l} of Dif f t (M) for
compact C s -manifolds M with a boundary ∂M 6= ∅, where Dif f t (M) has a
class of smoothness by Hölder C t , also a class of smoothness H t by Sobolev or
Besov was considered for t > dimR M + 5, ∆ denotes the Beltrami-Laplace
operator on M, ∂ν denotes the partial differentiation along normal to the
boundary in local coordinates, ∆0 = I and ∂ 0 = I are the unit operators.
In particular for a compact manifold with the boundary purely Gaussian
measures µ on Dif fkt (M) and Diflt (M) quasi-invariant relative to dense
                    ′
subgroups Dif fkt (M) and Diflt” (M) were constructed, where k and l and
t′ − t > 0 and t” − t > 0 are dependent on dimR M, s > t′ + 2 and s > t” + 2
respectively. The cases of Schwarz class of smoothness also were considered.
The given below theorem in the real case for finite measures was proved
shorlty earlier in [25], in the non-Archimedean case it is contained in [18].

                                         17
In theorem 3.8 a quasi-invariant σ-finite σ-additive measure is considered,
which may be unbounded. The cases of σ-finite non-negative measures and
probability measures on G are considered quite analogously. Certainly this
theorem is applicable not only to Gaussian measures but also to measures
which have definite properties of the quasi-invariance factors ρµ such that a
family of continuos functions {ρ1/2                           ′
                                   µ (z, g) = φ(g) : z ∈ G } parametrized with
z ∈ G′ separates points of G (see more precisely the proof below). It is essen-
tial in the proof that G is the infinite-dimensional non-locally group and G′
is its dense subgroup such that the measure µ is ergodic. Evidently, if µ′ is a
measure equivalent with µ, then the regular representations associated with
them are equivalent due to the isomorphism f (g) 7→ (µ′ (dg)/µ(dg))1/2f (g)
of the Hilbert space L2 (G, µ′, C) with L2 (G, µ, C), where f ∈ L2 (G, µ′, C)
and g ∈ G.
     3.8. Theorem. Let G be a group of diffeomorphisms with a real prob-
ability quasi-invariant measure µ relative to a dense subgroup G′ as in §3.7.
Then µ may be chosen such that the associated regular unitary representation
of G′ is irreducible.
     Proof. Let a measure ν on a Banach space H be of the same type as
in the proofs of theorems in papers cited in §3.7 such that a local diffeo-
morphism A : W → VH induces a quasi-invaraint measure on W and then
with the help of left shifts gj ∈ G′ on the entire group G, where W is an
open neighbourhood of e in G and VH is an open neighbourhood of 0 in
H. We choose a constant multiplier c > 0 for µ such that cµ(W ) = 1
and then denote such normalized measure by µ. The measure µ on G is
σ-finite, since 0 < µ(W ) < ∞ and G is with a countable base and a locally
finite covering as in §2.8 and §2.9. A strong continuity of the regular repre-
sentation T : G′ → U(L2 (G, µ, C)) follows from the continuity of the quasi-
invariance factor ρµ (ψ, x) by (ψ, x) ∈ G′ ×G and the embedding Te G′ ֒→ Te G
of trace class, where T µ := T , T (z)f (g) := ρµ1/2 (z, g)f (z −1 g), z ∈ G′ , g ∈ G,
f ∈ L2 (G, µ, C). Let a ν-measurable function f : H → C be such that
ν({x ∈ H : f (x + y) 6= f (x)} = 0 for each y ∈ X0 with f ∈ L1 (H, ν, C).
Let also Pk : l2 → L(k) be projectors such that Pk (x) = xk for each
       P                         P
x = ( j∈N xj ej ), where xk := kj=1 xj ej , xk ∈ L(k), L(k) := spR (e1 , ..., ek ),
                                         P
spR (ej : j ∈ N) := {y : y ∈ l2 ; y = nj=1 xj ej ; xj ∈ R; n ∈ N}. Since the
dense subspace X in H is isomorphic with l2 , then each finite-dimensional
subspace L(k) is complemented in H [32]. From the proof of Proposition
II.3.1 [5] in view of the Fubini Theorem there exists a sequence of cylindrical

                                         18
                               R
functions fk (x) = fk (xk ) = H⊖L(k) f (Pk x + (I − Pk )y)νI−Pk (dy) which con-
verges to f in L1 (H, ν, C), where ν = νL(k) ⊗ νI−Pk , νI−Pk is the measure on
H ⊖ L(k). Each cylindrical function fk is ν-almost everywhere constant on
H, since L(k) ⊂ Xo for each k ∈ N, consequently, f is ν-almost everywhere
constant on H. From the construction of G′ and µ with the help of the local
diffeomorphism A and ν it follows that, if a function f ∈ L1 (G, µ, C) satisfies
the following condition f h (g) = f (g) (mod µ) by g ∈ G for each h ∈ G′ , then
f (x) = const (mod µ), where f h (g) := f (hg), g ∈ G.
     Let f (g) = ChU (g) be the characteristic function of a subset U, U ⊂ G,
U ∈ Af (G, µ), then f (hg) = 1 ⇔ g ∈ h−1 U. If f h (g) = f (g) is true by
g ∈ G µ-almost everywhere, then µ({g ∈ G : f h (g) 6= f (g)}) = 0, that is
µ((h−1 U) △ U) = 0, consequently, the measure µ satisfies the condition (P )
from §VIII.19.5 [9], where A △ B := (A \ B) ∪ (B \ A) for each A, B ⊂ G.
For each subset E ⊂ gj Wj with gj ∈ G′ and Wj ⊂ W from §2.9 the outer
measure is bounded, µ∗ (E) ≤ 1, since µ(W ) = 1 and µ is non-negative [4],
consequently, there exists F ∈ Bf (G) such that F ⊃ E and µ(F ) = µ∗ (E).
This F may be interpreted as the least upper bound in Bf (G) relative to
the latter equality. In view of the Proposition VIII.19.5 [9] the measure µ is
ergodic, that is for each U ∈ Af (G, µ) and F ∈ Af (G, µ) with µ(U)×µ(F ) 6=
0 there exists h ∈ G′ such that µ((h ◦ E) ∩ F ) 6= 0.
     From Theorem I.1.2 [5] it follows that (G, Bf (G)) is a Radon space,
since G is separable and complete. Therefore, a class of compact subsets
approximates from below each measure µf , µf (dg) := |f (g)|µ(dg), where
f ∈ L2 (G, µ, C) =: H̄. Due to the Egorov Theorem 2.3.7 [8] for each ǫ > 0
and for each sequence fn (g) converging to f (g) for µ-almost every g ∈ G,
when n → ∞, there exists a compact subset K in G such that µ(G\K) < ǫ and
fn (g) converges on K uniformly by g ∈ K, when n → ∞. In each Hilbert space
L2 (Rn , λ, R) the linear span of functions functions f (x) = exp[(b, x)−(ax, x)]
is dense, where b and x ∈ Rn , a is a symmetric positive definite real n × n
matrix, (∗, ∗) is the standard scalar product in Rn and λ is the Lebesgue
measure on Rn . If a non-linear operator U on X satisfies conditions of Theo-
rem 26.1 [37], then ν U (dx)/ν(dx) = |detU ′ (U −1 (x))|ρν (x − U −1 (x), x), where
                                                             P
ν U (B) := ν(U −1 B) for each B ∈ Bf (X), ρν (z, x) = exp{ ∞   l=1 [2(z, el )(x, el )−
        2
(z, el ) ]/λl } by Theorem 26.2 [37], where λl and el are eigenvalues and eigen-
functions of the correlation operator J on X enumerated by l ∈ N, z ∈ X0 ,
ρν (z, x) := νz (dx)/ν(dx), νz (B) := ν(B − z) for each B ∈ Bf (X). Since the


                                         19
Gaussian measure ν induces with the help of subalgebras of cylinder subsets
in Bf (H) and Bf (X) the corresponding Gaussian measure on H, which is
also denoted by ν, then analogous formulas of quasi-invariance factor are
true for ν on H [5]. Hence in view of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem A.8 [9]
an algebra V(Q) of finite pointwise products of functions from the following
space spC {ψ(g) := (ρ(h, g))1/2 : h ∈ G′ } =: Q is dense in L2 (G, µ, C), since
ρ(e, g) = 1 for each g ∈ G and Lh : G → G are diffeomorphisms of the
manifold G, Lh (g) = hg.
     For each m ∈ N there are C ∞ -curves φbj , where j = 1, ..., m and b ∈
(−2, 2) := {a : a ∈ R; −2 < a < 2} is a parameter, such that φbj |b=0 = e
and (∂φbj /∂b)|b=0 are linearly independent in Te G′ vectors and φj := φ1j ,
φj ∈ G′ ∩ W , j = 1, ..., m, since G′ is the infinite-dimensional group, which
is complete relative to its own uniformity. Then the following condition
det(Ψ(g)) = 0 defines a submanifold GΨ in G of codimension over R,
     (i) codimR GΨ ≥ 1, where Ψ(g) is a matrix dependent from g ∈ G
with matrix elements Ψl,j (g) := Dφ2lj (ρ(φj , g))1/2 . If f ∈ H̄ is such that
(f (g), (ρ(φ, g))1/2)H̄ = 0 for each φ ∈ G′ ∩ W , then differentials of these
scalar products by φ are zero. But V(Q) is dense in H̄ and in view of con-
dition (i) this means that f = 0, since for each m there are φj ∈ G′ ∩ W
such that detΨ(g) 6= 0 µ-almost everywhere on G, g ∈ G. If kf kH̄ > 0, then
µ(supp(f )) > 0, consequently, µ((G′ supp(f )) ∩ W ) = 1, since G′ U = G for
each open U in G and for each ǫ > 0 there exists an open U, U ⊃ supp(f ),
such that µ(U \ supp(f )) < ǫ.
     This means that the linear span over C: spC {Chgk Wk φ(g) : φ(g) =
ρµ (h, g); h ∈ G′ } is dense in L2 (gk Wk , µ, C). Therefore, the following vec-

                    P
tor f0 (g) := ∞            −j                          µ
                      j=0 2 Chgj Wj (g) is cyclic for T , since {gj Wj : j ∈ No } is a
locally finite covering and µ̃(dg) = f0 (g)µ(dg) is a finite measure with contin-
                                  1/2
uous ρµ̃ such that f (g) 7→ f0 (g)f (g) establishes isomorphism of L2 (G, µ̃, C)
with L2 (G, µ, C). If fk ∈ L∞ (gk Wk , µ, C) for each k ∈ N and fk |(gk Wk ∩gl Wl )
= fl |(gk Wk ∩gl Wl ) for each gk Wk ∩ gl Wl 6= ∅ and supk kfk kL∞ (gk Wk ,µ,C) < ∞,
then there exists f ∈ L∞ (G, µ, C) such that f |gk Wk = fk for each k ∈ N,
where ChW (g) is the characteristic function of W , that is, ChW (g) = 1 for
each g ∈ W and ChW (g) = 0 for each g ∈ G \ W . From the construction
of µ it follows that for each f1,j and f2,j ∈ H̄, j = 1, ..., n, n ∈ N and each
ǫ > 0 there exists h ∈ G′ such that |(Th f1,j , f2,j )H̄ | ≤ ǫ|(f1,j , f2,j )H̄ |, when
|(f1,j , f2,j )H̄ | > 0, since G is the Radon space by Theorem I.1.2 [5] and G


                                          20
is not locally compact. This means that there is not any finite-dimensional
G′ -invariant subspace H ′ in H̄ such that Th H ′ ⊂ H ′ for each h ∈ G′ and
H ′ 6= {0}. Hence if there is a G′ -invariant closed subspace H ′ in H̄ it is
isomorphic with the subspace L2 (V, µ, C), where V ∈ Bf (G).
     Let AG denotes a ∗-subalgebra of L(H̄, H̄) = L(H̄) generated by the
family of unitary operators {Th : h ∈ G′ }. In view of the von Neumann dou-
ble commuter Theorem (see §VI.24.2 [9]) AG ” coincides with the weak and
strong operator closures of AG in L(H̄, H̄), where AG ′ denotes the commut-
ing algebra of AG and AG ” = (AG ′ )′ . Suppose that λ is a probability Radon
measure on G′ such that λ has not any atoms and supp(λ) = G′ . Let a(x) ∈
L∞ (G, µ, C), f and g ∈ H̄, β(h) ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C). Since L2 (G′ , λ, C) is infinite-
dimensional, then for each finite family of a ∈ {a1 , ..., am } ⊂ L∞ (G, µ, C),
f ∈ {f1 , ..., fm } ⊂ RH̄ there exists β(h) ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C), h ∈ G′ , such that
β is orthogonal to G f¯s (g)[fj (h−1 g)(ρ(h, g))1/2 − fj (g)]µ(dg) for each s, j =
1, ..., m. Hence each operator of multiplication on aj (g) belongs to AG ”, since
                                             R R
there   exists β(h) such that (f                   ¯
                                s , aj fl ) = G G′ fs (g)β(h)(ρ(h, g))
                                                                       1/2
                                                                           fRl (hR−1 g)λ(dh)µ(dg)
    R R                                       R
= G G′ fs (g)β(h)(Thfl (g))λ(dh)µ(dg), G fs (g)aj (g)fl (g)µ(dg) = G G′ f¯s (g)
           ¯                                     ¯
β(h) fl (g)λ(dh)µ(dg) = (fs , aj fl ). Hence AG ” contains subalgebra of all op-
erators of multiplication on functions from L∞ (G, µ, C).
     Let us remind the following. A Banach bundle B over a Hausdorff space
G is a bundle < B, π > over G′ , together with operations and norms making
  ′

each fiber Bh (h ∈ G′ ) into a Banach space such that conditions BB(i − iv)
are satisfied: BB(i) x → kxk is continuous on B to R; BB(ii) the operation
+ is continuous as a function on {(x, y) ∈ B ×B : π(x) = π(y)} to B; BB(iii)
for each λ ∈ C, the map x → λx is continuous on B to B; BB(iv) if h ∈ G′
and {xi } is any net of elements of B such that kxi k → 0 and π(xi ) → h in G′ ,
then xi → 0h in B, where π : B → G′ is a bundle projection, Bh := π −1 (h) is
the fiber over h (see §II.13.4 [9]). If G′ is a Hausdorff topological group, then
a Banach algebraic bundle over G′ is a Banach bundle B =< B, π > over
G′ together with a binary operation • on B satisfying conditions AB(i − v):
AB(i) π(b • c) = π(b)π(c) for b and c ∈ B; AB(ii) for each x and y ∈ G′
the product • is bilinear on Bx × By to Bxy ; AB(iii) the product • on B
is associative; AB(iv) kb • ck ≤ kbk × kck (b, c ∈ B); AB(v) the map • is
continuous on B × B to B (see §VIII.2.2 [9]). With G′ and a Banach algebra
A the trivial Banach bundle B = A×G′ is associative, in particular let A = C
(see §VIII.2.7 [9]).
     The regular representation T of G′ gives rise to a canonical regular H̄-

                                          21
projection-valued measure P̄ : P̄ (W )f = ChW f , where f ∈ H̄, W ∈ Bf (G),
ChW is the characteristic function of W . Therefore, Th P̄ (W ) = P̄ (h ◦ W )Th
for each h ∈ G′ and W ∈ Bf (G), since ρ(h, h−1 ◦ g)ρ(h, g) = 1 = ρ(e, g)
for each (h, g) ∈ G′ × G, ChW (h−1 ◦ g) = Chh◦W (g) and Th (P̄ (W )f (g)) =
ρ(h, g)1/2 P̄ (h ◦ W )f (h−1 ◦ g). Thus < T, P̄ > is a system of imprimitivity
for G′ over G, which is denoted Tµ . This means that conditions SI(i − iii)
are satisfied: SI(i) T is a unitary representation of G′ ; SI(ii) P̄ is a regular
H̄-projection-valued Borel measure on G and SI(iii) Th P̄ (W ) = P̄ (h ◦ W )Th
for all h ∈ G′ and W ∈ Bf (G).
    For each F ∈ L∞ (G, µ, C) let ᾱF be the operator in L(H̄, H̄) = L(H̄)
consisting of multiplication by F : ᾱF (f ) = F f , f ∈ H̄. The map F → ᾱF is
an isometric ∗-isomorphism of L∞ (G, µ, C) into L(H̄, H̄) (see §VIII.19.2[9]).
Therefore, Propositions VIII.19.2,5[9] (using the approach of this particular
case given above) are applicable in our situation.
    If p̄ is a projection onto a closed Tµ -stable subspace of H̄, then p̄ com-
mutes with all P̄ (W ). Hence p̄ commutes with multiplication by all F ∈
L∞ (G, µ, C), so by VIII.19.2 [9] p̄ = P̄ (V ), where V ∈ Bf (G). Also p̄ com-
mutes with all Th , h ∈ G′ , consequently, (h ◦ V ) \ V and (h−1 ◦ V ) \ V are
µ-null for each h ∈ G′ , hence µ((h ◦ V ) △ V ) = 0 for all h ∈ G′ . In view of
ergodicity of µ and proposition VIII.19.5 [9] either µ(V ) = 0 or µ(G \ V ) = 0,
hence either p̄ = 0 or p̄ = I, where I is the unit operator. Hence T is the
irreducible unitary representation.
    Almost analogous proof was done in the case of loop groups with the
corresponding quasi-invaraint measures and with the use of the spectral the-
orem for the family of commuting unitary operators, since the loop group is
Abelian in [23, 24]. In the non-Archimedean case G′ has the analytic atlas
At(G′ ) = {(Uj , ψj ) : j ∈ N} with disjoint clopen charts, hence curves φbj can
be chosen locally analytic with a restriction on the corresponding neighbour-
hood U1 of e being analytic, where b ∈ L. Substitution of differentiation on
pseudodifferentiation along φbj by parameter b ∈ B(L, 0, 1) produces by for-
mula det(Ψ(g)) = 0 an analytic submanifold GΨ in G with codimL GΨ ≥ 1,
since G is the analytic manifold.
    3.9. Theorem. Let Pm be the ergodic Poisson measure on Γ̃X as in
§2.4, 2.9 and q be an irreducible representation of the symmetric group Σn
(q = I for X = G and may be non-trivial for X = M finite-dimensional over
the coresponding field L and a group of diffeomorphisms G′ of M). Then the
representation Um ⊗ Vmq from §3.1 is irreducible.

                                       22
     Proof. The case of real finite-dimensional M was proved in [38]. The
case of non-Archimedean M with dimL M < ∞ follows from §3.5, since
Γ̃X = ΓX in this case. Indeed, Um ⊗ Vmq is equivalent with Un◦m                      q
                                                                                         and f φ ∈
   2                                 2                               ∞
L (ΓX , Pm , C), if f ∈ L (ΓX , Pm , C) and φ ∈ L (ΓX , Pm , C). Then each
subspace L in L2 (ΓX , Pm , C)⊗H q invariant relative to G′ = Dif f t (X) is also
invariant relative to multiplications on functions φ ∈ L∞ (ΓX , Pm , C), since
      L
L = r,i Lil,r , where Lil,r := L∩(L2 (BK        r
                                                  l
                                                    ×ΓX\Kl , µr , C)⊗Wri ⊗Cri ) are subspaces
invariant relative to Dif f t (Kl ), µ = Pm and µr is the corresponding measure
       r
on BK    l
           × ΓX\KL . In view of lemma 2.14 the measure µn is equivalent with
  ′
µ n × µ”n and further as at the end of §3 [38].
     The remaining cases are proved analogously to the proof of theorem 3.8
(and see [18, 23, 24]) applied to the pair (G′ , Γ̃X ) instead of (G′ , G), since Γ̃X
is C ∞ -manifold and from infinite differentiability or pseudodifferentiability
of m it follows, that Pm is also infinite differentiable or pseudodifferentiable
respectively, morever, Pm is the ergodic measure due to theorem 2.9. In the
case of X = M the measures on X are chosen to be such that spC {ρ1/2                     m (z, x) =
φ(x) : z ∈ G′ } is dense in L2 (X, m, C) in accordance with §2.9 and the cited
papers there, for example, Gaussian measures or product measures of special
type on Tx M induce the demanded measures on M, where x ∈ M.
     It remains only to establish that the density ρPm has the demanded prop-
erties. For this it is necessary to use the fact that operators Lh on X (either
X = M or X = G) are infinitely strongly differentiable by h ∈ G′ and
there exists a dense subset G” in G′ such that (Lh )(n) 6= 0 for each n ∈ N
and each h ∈ G”. Therefore, (ALh A−1 )(n) 6= 0 for each h ∈ G”, where
A : U → VH is a local diffeomorphism, where U and VH are open subsets
in X and the corresponding Banach space H respectively as in §2.9, §3.8
and the cited above papers. In the Hilbert space L2 (Rmn, λ, C) is dense

                        n
     Using charts in BX    we get projections L2 (BX     n
                                                           , mn , C) into L2 (Rmn , λmn , C)
in the real case and into L2 (Lmn , νmn , C) in the non-Archimedean case. Then
                                              ′
we use Taylor expansion up to o(dkG′+1 (ψ, h)) of Lh in a suitable neighbour-
hoods hU ′ in G′ of elements h ∈ G” with U ′ open in G′ with e ∈ U ′ ⊂ W ′
and with k ′ = 2k in the real case and k ′ = k in the non-Archimedean
case, where dG′ is the metric in G′ in its own uniformity, ψ ∈ hU ′ . For
a manifold C t (M, N) of mappings f : M → N of class of smoothness
C t with t ≥ 1 for C ∞ -manifolds M and N in the real case and analytic
manifolds in the non-Archimedean case the tangent manifold T C t (M, N) is
isomorphic with C t (M, T N) and for the n-th order we get T n C t (M, N) =
C t (M, T n N) (see also [6, 13, 24]). Then T n Dif f t (M) is a submanifold in
C t (M, T n M). Let C t (M, m0 ; N, n0 ) be a family of mappings f ∈ C t (M, N)
preserving marked points f (m0 ) = n0 , m0 ∈ M and n0 ∈ N, where in
the real case M = S m is the m-dimensional real sphere and dimR N > m.
Analogously for others classes of smoothness ω considered for construction
of loop groups L(M, m0 ; N, n0 )ω , elements of which are closures of orbits
cl{f (ψ(x)) : ψ ∈ G(M), ψ(m0 ) = m0 }, where G(M) denotes the group of
diffeomorphisms of M of the corresponding class of smoothness and with cer-
tain additional construction in the non-Archimedean case [19, 23, 24]. Hence
the manifold T n L(M, m0 ; N, n0 )ω is isomorphic with the following manifold
T n L(M, m0 ; T n N, (n0 , 0̄n ))ω ⊗ T(n
                                       n
                                         0 ,0̄n )
                                                  N, where 0̄n ∈ T n N is the zero section
for each n ∈ N. Therefore, it is possible to vary values of differentials D j f for
j = 0, ..., n in the notation T n f := (f, Df, D 2f, ..., D n f ) with D 0 f := f for
elements f ∈ G” both in the case of the diffeomorphism group and the loop
group up to the corrections o(dn+1                              n
                                      G′ (f, ψ)). Then Dh Lh (g) can be expressed
through D j h and D j g with 1 ≤ j ≤ n, where h, g ∈ G, hence it is possible
to vary coefficients al1 , al2 in the real case and al , bl in the non-Archimedean
case.
     Take for example, the Gaussian measure on X in the real case induced
from the Gaussian measure on the corresponding Banach space and given
with the help of non-degenerate symmetric positive definite operator of trace


                                            24
class. In the non-Archimedean case each Banach space over a local field L
is isomorphic with c0 (α, L), where α is an ordinal and elements of c0 (α, L)
have the form x = (xj : j ∈ α, xj ∈ L) such that kxk := supj |xj | < ∞ and
for each ǫ > 0 a set {j : |xj | > ǫ} is finite [34]. For each separable manifold
M we have card(α) ≤ ℵ0 . In the latter case take, for example, the following
non-Archimedean analog η of the Gaussian measure: each projection ηj of
                                                                       P
η on Lej has a density ηj (dx) = Fj exp(−|x|2 sj )v(dx), where j s−1        j   < ∞,
ej := (0, ..., 0, 1, 0...) with 1 on the j-th place, v is the Haar measure on L
with v(B(L, 0, 1)) = 1 and constants Fj > 0 are chosen such that ηj (L) = 1
(see also §2.9).
    Let ψjb be C ∞ -curves in G′ such that (∂ψjb /∂b)|b=0 are linearly independent
vectors in Tgk G′ and ψjb |b=0 = gk and R(ψj ) ∩ R(ψl ) ∩ (gk Wk ) = {gk } for each
j 6= l, b ∈ L, where either X = M or X = G, j = 1, ..., n, n ∈ N, R(ψ)
denotes the range of ψ, that is, R(ψ) := {ψ b : b ∈ L}, gk ∈ G′ , Sk is open
in Γ̃X , ζk : Sk → Qk are local diffeomorphisms of open subsets Sk in Γ̃X and
ΓX respectively, γ ∈ gk Sk (see also §2.4).
    There are embeddings L2 (BK     n
                                      , mn , C) ֒→ L2 (BX
                                                        n

L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C), where mn denotes the restriction of Pm on BX        n
                                                                         . For each
x ∈ X there exists K ∈ {Kl : l ∈ N} such that x ∈ Int(K). Then ΓK is the
                          n
disjoint union of {BK       : n ∈ No }. On the other hand, PK,m|Bf (K n ) = mK,n
in accordance with §3.1, where mK,n is equivalent with mnK , where mK de-
notes the restriction of m on Bf (K) and mnK is the product of n copies of
mK . Then the condition det(Ψ(γ)) = 0 defines a submanifold Γ̃X,Ψ in Γ̃X of
codimension over L,
    (i) codimL Γ̃X,Ψ ≥ 1, where Ψ(γ) is a matrix dependent from γ ∈ Γ̃X
with indices of rows and columns j and l = 1, ..., n for n ∈ N with matrix
elements Ψl,j (γ) := Dφ2lj (ρ(φj , g))1/2 in the real case and with the corre-

sponding pseudodifferentials by parameters bj ∈ B(L, 0, 1) and for φjj in the
non-Archimedean case instead of differentials (see also [18, 28]). In the non-
Archimedean case Γ̃X has the analytic atlas At(Γ̃X ) = {(Vj , ωj ) : j ∈ N}
with disjoint clopen charts, also G′ has disjoint clopen charts and the an-
alytic atlas At(G′ ) = {(Uj , φj ) : j}, hence curves ψjb can be chosen locally
analytic with a restriction on the corresponding neighbourhood U1 of e in
G′ being analytic, where b ∈ L. Substitution of differentiation on pseu-
dodifferentiation along φbj by parameter b ∈ B(L, 0, 1) produces by formula
det(Ψ(γ)) = 0 an analytic submanifold Γ̃X,Ψ in Γ̃X with codimL Γ̃X,Ψ ≥ 1.


                                         25
Since for equivalent measures such regular representations are equivalent, we
can consider infinitely differentiable or pseudodifferentiable measures in the
real and non-Archimedean cases respectively. There is the following equality
lim(mn (B)→0,∞>mn (B)>0) mn (B)exp(−mn (B))/((mn )ψ (B)exp(−(mn )ψ (B))) =:
mn (dx)exp(−mn (dx))/((mn )ψ (dx)exp(−(mn )ψ (dx))) = ρmn (ψ, x), since ρmn (ψ, x)
is continuous on G′ × X̃ n and lim(mn (B)→0,∞>mn (B)>0,x∈B) exp(−mn (B)[1 −
R                  n       n                                 n
 B ρmn (ψ, y)m (dy)/m (B)]) = 1 for balls B in X̃ such that x ∈ Int(B),
where (mn )ψ (E) := mn (ψ −1 E) for each Borel subset E ∈ Bf (X̃ n ), ψ ∈ G′ ,
x ∈ X̃ n .
     In the case X = G each space L2 (BX         r
                                                   , mr , C) has the embedding into
  2
L (Γ̃X , Pm , C), where mr := Pm |BXr . It was supposed above that the quasi-
invariance factor ρm (ψ, x) of the quasi-invariant measure m on Bf (X) rela-
tive to G′ is continuous on G′ ×X, consequently, ρmr (ψ, η) and ρmr (ψ, γ r ) and
ρPm (ψ, γ) are continuous on G′ × X r and G′ × BX         r
                                                            and G′ × ΓX respectively,
                 ′       r   r       r
where ψ ∈ G , η ∈ X , γ ∈ BX , γ ∈ ΓX . Hence due to the definiton of Pm
there is the equality: limr≥n,r→∞ ρmr (ψ, γ n ) = ρPm (ψ, γ n ) for each ψ ∈ G′ ,
γ n ∈ BX n
           . If f ∈ H̄ := L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) is such that (f (g), (ρPm (φ, g))1/2 )H̄ = 0
for each φ ∈ G′ ∩ W , then differentials of these scalar products by φ are zero.
In view of the above embeddings and formula 2.4(i) and in view of condition
(i) this means that f = 0, since for each n ∈ N there are φj ∈ G′ ∩ W such
that detΨ(γ) 6= 0 Pm -almost everywhere on Γ̃X , γ ∈ Γ̃X . If kf kH̄ > 0, then
Pm (supp(f )) > 0, consequently, Pm (G′ supp(f )) = 1, since G′ U = Γ̃X for
each open U in Γ̃X and for each ǫ > 0 there exists an open U, U ⊃ supp(f ),
such that Pm (U \ supp(f )) < ǫ.
     This means that the linear span over C: spC {Chgk Sk φ(g) : φ(g) =
  1/2
ρPm (h, g); h ∈ G′ } is dense in L2 (gk Sk , Pm , C), since U ′ l Kl ⊂ Int(Kl+1 ) for
                                                                 1/2
each l ∈ N (see §2.9). Therefore, spC {φ(g) : φ(g) = ρPm (h, g); h ∈ G′ } is
dense in L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) and a vector f0 is cyclic for Um , where f0 (γ) = 1
for each γ ∈ Γ̃X . Then AG ” contains subalgebra of all operators of multi-
plication on functions from L∞ (Γ̃X , Pm , C) and the remainder of the proof
of theorem 3.9 is quite analogous with the proof of theorem 3.8 (certainly
AG ” 6= L∞ (Γ̃X , Pm , C)I for G′ = Dif f t (M), since the regular representation
Um (h) of G′ contains a family of cardinality c := card(R) of non-commuting
operators from the set {Um (h) : h ∈ G′ }).
     3.10. Theorem. (α). If there exists a bounded operator T : L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C)⊗

that L2 ⊗ {0} := L2 ) satisfying conditions (a, b):

(b) there exists φ ∈ H q such that T (1 ⊗ φ) 6= 0,
then Pm and Pm′ are equivalent.
       (β). If there exists a bounded operator V : L2 (G, µ, C) → L2 (G, µ′, C)
                                 ′
such that V T µ (ψ) = T µ (ψ)V for each ψ ∈ G′ , where µ is a quasi-invaraint
measure on G relative to G′ and T µ is the associated regular representation
of G′ from theorem 3.8, then µ and µ′ are equivalent.
       The proof is divided into several parts. At first the case (α) of X = M
finite-dimensional over the corresponding filed L is considered in subpara-
graphs I-III. The cases (α) of X = G and infinite-dimensional X = M over
L and the cases (β) are considered in §3.10.IV.
       I. Suppose that kφk = 1 and T is a contraction operator. Take Xn := Kn ,
where n ∈ N and Kn are the same as in §2.9. In the case X = M we put
Y = Xn , µ = Pm , µ′ = Pm′ , µ1 and µ2 are equal to the image measure of
µ in accordance with the maps: γ 7→ (γ ∩ Y ) =: γ1 , γ 7→ (γ ∩ Y c ) =: γ2 .
Apart from the case X = M, for X = G we suppose that Y = X, since G′
acts on G transitively and supp(Lψ ) := cl{g ∈ G : ψg 6= g} = G for each
ψ 6= e, because G′ is a dense subgroup of G and from hg = g it follows h = e,
where h, g ∈ G. In the case of Dif f t (X) there exists a bounded operator
                                                            ′
TY : L2 (ΓY , µ1 , C) ⊗ H q → L2 (ΓY , µ′1 , C) ⊗ H q such that
                              R
       (i) TY F (γ, a′) = ΓY c T F (γ1, γ2 , a′ )µ′2 (dγ2 ). Then L2 (ΓY , µ1 , C) is em-
beddable as a closed subspace into L2 (ΓX , µ, C) by the map L2 (ΓY , µ1 , C) ∋
f (γ) 7→ fˆ(γ) := f (γ ∩ Y ) ∈ L2 (ΓX , µ, C). Therefore, TY F depends on
(γ1 , a′ ) and TY F (γ, a′σ ) = q ′ (σ)−1 TY F (γ, a′ ) for all σ ∈ Σn′ , where a′σ =
                                                         ′
(i , ..., Riσ(n′ ) ) for each a′ = (i1 , ..., in′ ) ∈ Ñn . Then for Dif f t (X): kTY F k2 =

case X = M, consequently, kTY k ≤ 1 and TY is a contraction too. When ψ ∈
                                                                                    q′

for each ψ ∈ Dif f t (Y ).
                                                                                          r
       There exists the decomposition of ΓX into disjoint union of subsets BX               k
                                                                                              ×
ΓX\Xk for r = 0, 1, 2, ..., where each such subset is invariant relative to
Dif f t (Xk ), where k is fixed and BX           r
                                                     is the set of r-point subsets in Xk ,

BXk := {∅} is the singleton. Therefore, L2 (ΓX , µ, C) ⊗ H = ∞

§2.13). Hence L (BXk × ΓX\Xk , µr , C) ⊗ H = i (L (BXk × ΓX\Xk , µr , C) ⊗
Wri ⊗ Cri ), where Wri are spaces in which irreducible pairwise non-equivalent
unitary representations qri of the symmetric group Σr act, Cri denote spaces
in which Σr acts trivially. Each term in the direct sum is invariant under
Dif f t (Xk ) such that from ψ ∈ Dif f t (Xk ) and γ ∈ BX                  r
                                                                             k

that σ(ψ, γ) ∈ Σr .
     In view of lemma 2.14 the measure µr is equivalent with µ′r × µ”r . Hence
there exists the isomorphism τr : L2 (BX           r

                                                                                              , µ′r , C) ⊗
L2 (ΓX\Xk , µ”r , C) given by the following formula: τr F := [µr (dγ)/(µ′r (dγ ′ )µ”r (dγ”))]1/2

                                                                   k

dimensional manifolds M over R or the local field L considered here for
µ = Pm there is true the following lemma (for finite-dimensional real M see
also lemma 3.2 [38]).
                                                                                                      q
     3.11. Lemma. Under the isomorphism τr the operator U(ψ) := Um                                      (ψ)
                                 t                                −1          i
for each ψ ∈ Dif f (Xk ) transforms into τr U(ψ)τr = Ur (ψ) ⊗ I, where I is
the unit operator in L2 (ΓX\Xk , µ”r , C)⊗Cri and Uri is the operator in the space

where γ r ∈ BX         r
                         k
                           .
     II. A unitary representation Q : Σ∞ → U(H q ) such that Q(σ) : φ(a) 7→
φ(σ −1 a) restricted on Σr splits into the direct sum of subspaces: H q =
L       i          i                         P     i                        P
   i Wr ⊗ Cr , that is, Q(σ)φ =                i {qr ⊗ id}φr,i , φ =            i φr,i , where φr,i ∈
Wri ⊗ Cri , qri are the ireducible and pairwise distinct representations of Σr ,
                                                   S
Σ∞ := ind − limr Σr . Since ΓY = ∞                          r
                                                     r=0 BY is the disjoint union of BY ,
                                                                                                          r

then there are the following orthogonal decompositions: L2 (ΓY , µ1, C) =
L∞          2      r                     2              q      L
   r=0 L (BY , µ1 , C) and L (ΓY , µ1 , C) ⊗ H =                 r,i φµ (r, i), where φµ (r, i) :=
  2    r                       i     i                                                           q
L (BY , µ1, C)⊗Wr ⊗Cr are invariant subspaces of the representation Um                               |Dif f t (Y ) .
                      q              r,i
Therefore, Um (ψ) = Uµ (ψ) ⊗ id on φµ (r, i), where
     (II.i) Uµr,i (ψ)(F ⊗ wri ) = ρ1/2                        −1         i
                                            µ1 (ψ, γ1 )F (ψ (γ1 ))qr (σ(ψ, γ))wr for F ∈
                                                                                           i

L2 (BYr , µ1, C) and wri ∈ Wri . The irreducible unitary representations Uµr,i
           ′ ′
and Uµr ,i are equivalent if and only if i = i′ and r = r ′ .
     Hence there exists the unique integer Ji such that either TY φµ (r, i) = 0
or TY φµ (r, i) ⊂ φµ′ (r, Ji ) and the representations qri and q ′ Jr′i are equivalent,
consequently, Ji 6= Jk for each i 6= k.
     There exist intertwining operators ωr,i : Wri → W ′ Jr i of the representa-


                                                 28
tions qri and q ′ Jr i . We denote by JY the unitary operator JY : L2 (BYr , µ1 , C) →
L2 (BYr , µ′1 , C) given by the following formula: JY F (γ1 ) := (µ1 (dγ1 )/µ′ 1 (dγ1 ))1/2 F (γ1).
Hence
     (II.ii) Uµr,J                       r,i                             t
                   ′ (ψ)Tr,i = Tr,i Uµ (ψ) for each ψ ∈ Dif f (Y ), where Tr,i =
                     i


JY ⊗ ωr,i : L2 (BYr , µ1 , C) ⊗ Wri → L2 (BYr , µ′ 1 , C) ⊗ W ′ Jr i .
     III. Using the general fact of the representation theory of topological
groups from §III of the proof of theorem 3.1 in [36] we get for each (r, i): either
exists a bounded operator Ur,i : Cri → C ′ Jr i such that TY |φµ (r,i) = Tr,i ⊗ Ur,i
or TY φµ (r, i) = 0. Hence for Dif f t (Y ) there is the following equality:
                                      P
     (III.i) TY (1⊗φ)(γ, a′ ) = ′ r,i Tr,i ⊗Ur,i (χBYr ⊗φr,i )(γ, a′ ) = (mu1 (dγ1)/µ′ 1 (dγ1)
P′                                     ′         P′
   r,i χBYr (γ1 )(ωr,i ⊗Ur,i )(φr,i )(a ), where    is a sum for (r, i) such that TY φµ (r, i) 6=
                                i      i
0, φ = sumi φr,i , φr,i ∈ Wr ⊗Cr , χA is the characteristic function of the subset
              P                                               P             P
A. Then k ′ r,i χBYr (γ1 )(ωr,i ⊗ Ur,i )(φr,i )(a′ )k2W ′ ≤ r χBYr (γ1 ) i kφr,i k2 = 1.
     In the case of Dif f t (X) if Pm and Pm′ are mutually singular, then
limk→∞ TXk (1⊗φ)(γ, a′ ) converges to T (1⊗φ)(γ, a′ ) for Pm′ -a.e. γ due to the
                                                                                       P

assumption of this theorem.
     IV. In view of theorem 3.9 representations Um are irreducible for X = G
or infinite-dimensional X = M over the field L. It was proved in §3.9 that
     (IV.i) the weak closure of subalgebra generated by the family {Um (h) :
h ∈ G′ } in the algebra of bounded linear operators L(H̄) contains all op-
erators of multiplication on functions from the space L∞ (Γ̃X , Pm , C), where
H̄ := L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C). If measures Pm and Pm′ are singular, then
     (IV.ii) either sup(γ∈Γ̃X ) |Pm′ (dγ)/Pm (dγ)| = ∞ or sup(γ∈Γ̃X ) |Pm (dγ)/Pm′ (dγ)| =
∞, where Pm′ (dγ)/Pm (dγ) := lim(Pm (B)→0,∞>Pm (B)>0,γ∈B) Pm′ (B)/Pm (B) ∈
[0, ∞], [0, ∞] := ([0, ∞) ∪ {∞}), [0, ∞) := {x : x ∈ R, 0 ≤ x}, B ∈
Bf (Γ̃X ). In view of the existence of the intertwining operator T of Um
with Um′ there exists an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces τ : L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) →
L2 (Γ̃X , Pm′ , C), which has a continuous extension to an isomorphism of Ba-
nach spaces τ : L∞ (Γ̃X , Pm , C) → L∞ (Γ̃X , Pm′ , C) due to condition (IV.i).
On the other hand, in view of condition (IV.ii) there exists a sequence
fn ∈ L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) such that C1 an ≤ bn ≤ C2 an for each n ∈ N and
limn→∞ cn < ∞ and limn→∞ dn = ∞, where C1 and C2 are positive con-
stants, an := kfn kL2 (Γ̃X ,Pm ,C) , bn := kτ fn kL2 (Γ̃X ,Pm′ ,C) , cn := kfn kL∞ (Γ̃X ,Pm ,C) ,
dn := kτ fn kL∞ (Γ̃X ,Pm′ ,C) , since there are sequences {yn : 0 < yn < ∞, n ∈ N}


                                         29
          P                   P
such that n yn−2 < ∞, but n yn−1 = ∞. This means that singularity of Pm
with Pm′ leads to the contradiction, consequently, Pm and Pm′ are equivalent.
The cases (β) are proved analogously with µ instead of Pm and G instead of
Γ̃X due to theorem 3.8.

    3.12. Corollary. (α). If Um      and Um   ′ are equivalent as unitary repre-

sentations, then Pm and Pm′ are equivalent as measures.
                       ′
    (β). If T µ and T µ are equivalent as unitary representations, then µ and
µ′ are equivalent as measures.
    3.13. Theorem. (α). If Pm and Pm′ are equivalent, n = n′ , unitary
representations q and q ′ of Σn and Σn′ are equivalent (in the case Dif f t (M)
of the real manifold M with the additional condition dimR M > 1; H q = {0}
and q = I for X = G or for infinite-dimensional manifold X = M over the
                                                q        q′
field L). Then the unitary representations Um      and Um  ′ are equivalent.

    (β). If µ and µ′ from theorem 3.8 are equivalent quasi-invaraint measures
                                                                              ′
on G relative to G′ , then the regular unitary representations T µ and T µ are
equivalent.
    Proof. The cases (α) for X = M infinite-dimensional over the field L
or X = G and (β) follow from the fact that τ : L2 (Z, µ, C) → L2 (Z, µ′, C)
given by the following formula (τ f )(x) = (µ(dx)/µ′(dx))1/2 f (x) is the linear
topological isomorphism and the intertwining operator of two regular rep-
resentations in these Hilbert spaces, where either Z = Γ̃X with µ = Pm or
Z = G with a quasi-invariant measure µ relative to G′ respectively.
    It remains only to consider the case of the non-Archimedean manifold
X = M with dimL M < ∞, since the case of real M was proved in §4 [38].
The measure m on M is supposed to be the restriction of the Haar measure
from Ln on M (see §2.9). Let Dif f t (X, m) be a subgroup of G′ = Dif f t (X)
consisting of diffeomorphisms ψ, for which ρm (ψ, x) = 1 for each x ∈ M,
where 1 ≤ t ≤ ∞. In the case of X = M = R we have Dif f t (X, m) = {e},
but in the non-Archimedean case each ψ ∈ G′ with supx∈M |ψ ′ (x) − I| < 1
belongs to Dif f t (X, m). For example, if a countable family of disjoint balls
Bj := B(Ln , xj , r) with j ∈ Υ ⊂ N of radius 0 < r < ∞ is contained in M
and if ψ ∈ G′ is such that ψ(Bj ) = Bζ(j) for each j ∈ Υ, ψ|Bj (xj + z) =
xζ(j) + φj (z) for each z ∈ B(Ln , 0, r), ψ|(M \S Bj ) = id, φj : B(Ln , 0, r) →
                                                  j
B(Ln , 0, r) are diffeomorphisms with sup(x∈B(Ln ,0,r)) |φ′j (x) − I| < 1 for each
j ∈ N, where ζ : Υ → Υ is a bijection, then ψ ∈ Dif f t (M, m), since
B(Ln , 0, r) are clopen in Ln and the valuation group {|x|L : 0 6= x ∈ L}


                                       30
is discrete in (0, ∞). Therefore, in the non-Archimedean case there is not
any restriction on dimL M from below. If A ⊂ ΓX is invariant by mod(Pm )
subset of ΓX and Pm (A) > 0, then Pm (A) = 1. Indeed, if Pm (ΓX \ A) > 0,
then there exists ψ ∈ Dif f t (X, m) such that Pm ((ΓX \ A) ∩ ψ(A)) > 0, since
m is quasi-invariant relative to G′ with the continuous quasi-invariant factor
ρm (h, x) by (h, x) ∈ G′ × ΓX and Pm ((hA) ∩ B) is the continuous function
by h ∈ G′ for each A and B ∈ Af (ΓX , Pm ), where Af (ΓX , Pm ) denotes the
completion of the Borel σ-field Bf (ΓX ) by the ergodic measure Pm . In view
of the invariance of A we have Pm ((ΓX \A)∩A) > 0, which is a contradiction,
hence Pm (ΓX \ A) = 0.
     The restriction of the regular unitary representation Um |Dif f t (X,m) is given
by the following formula:
     (Um (ψ)f )(γ) = f (ψ −1 γ) for each ψ ∈ Dif f t (X, m). Then f0 (γ) = 1
for each γ ∈ ΓX is the unique vector in L2 (ΓX , Pm , C) such that Cf0 is
invariant relative to Um (ψ) for each ψ ∈ Dif f t (M, m). The Poisson mea-
sure Pm can be considered with a parameter λ > 0, that is with λm in-
stead of m. Let um (ψ) be a spherical function given by the following for-
mula: um (ψ) = (Um (ψ)f0 , f0 ), where (∗, ∗) denotes the scalar product in
  2
                                         R   1/2
L   (Γ X , Pm , C). Then um (ψ) = exp( X (ρm (ψ, x) − 1)m(dx)), since um (ψ) =
R     Q        1/2
 ΓX ( x∈γ ρ        (ψ, x))Pm (dγ) and for supp(ψ) ⊂ Y with m(Y ) < ∞ we have
            P∞ R         Q
um (ψ) = n=0 Bn ( x∈γ ρ1/2 (ψ, x))Pm |BYn (dγ). Therefore, we get the follow-
                       Y
ing theorem.
     3.14. Theorem. (α). The representations Uλ1 m and Uλ2 m of Dif f t (M)
(with the restriction dimR M > 1 for M over R and 0 < dimL M in the
non-Archimedean case) for λ1 6= λ2 are inequivalent.
     (β). The representations Uλ1 m and Uλ2 m of G′ in L2 (Γ̃G , Pλj m , C) with
j = 1, 2 respectively are inequivalent for λ1 6= λ2 .
     Proof. (α). For dimL M < ∞ this follows from the fact uλ1 m 6= uλ2 m .
     (β). In view of the Kakutani theorem [5] two Poisson measures Pλ1 m and
Pλ2 m are singular, hence by theorem 3.10 representations Uλ1 m and Uλ2 m are
inequivalent.
     3.15. Note. By the given above representations it is possible to produce
new with the help of the following construction. Let G′ be a group acting
from the left on a C ∞ -manifold Y (or analytic with disjoint charts in the
non-Archimedean case over the local field L) such that on Y is given a σ-
additive σ-finite quasi-invariant non-negative measure µ with a continuous


                                         31
quasi-invariant factor ρµ (ψ, y) by (ψ, y) ∈ G′ × Y . In the real case let us
consider a space F(Y ) of generalised functions on Y . For example, if there is
a unitary regular representation T of G′ in L2 (Y, µ, C), then F(Y ) is a space
of continuous linear functionals on L2 (Y, µ, C), hence F(Y ) is isomorphic
with L2 (Y, µ, C). Let ν be a measure on F(Y ) given with the help of its
                           R
characteristic function F(Y ) exp(i < F, f >)ν(dF ) = exp(−kf k2 /2), where
k∗k is a norm in L2 (Y, µ, C). Such ν is called the standard Gaussian measure
in F(Y ). Then a new representation Ũ := EXPβ T is given by the following
formula:
     (Ũ (ψ)Φ)(F ) := exp(i < F, β(ψ) >)Φ(T ∗ (ψ)F ), where < T ∗ (ψ)F, f >=<
F, T (ψ)f >, < F, f > is a value of a functional F ∈ F(Y ) on a function
f ∈ L2 (Y, µ, C), β is a 1-cocycle such that [β(ψ)](y) := ρ1/2
                                                             µ (ψ, y)−1, T (ψ) :=
ρ (ψ, y)f (ψ y) for each ψ ∈ G , Φ ∈ L (F, ν, C), T ∗ (ψ) = T −1 (ψ) =
  1/2           −1                      ′         2

T (ψ −1 ). If to substitute β on sβ, where s ∈ R, then it produces the one-
parameter family Ũs := EXPsβ T . There is an equality limψ→e β(ψ, y) = 0 for
each y ∈ Y . When Y = G or Y = Γ̃X and µ is as in theorems 3.8 or 3.9, then
for s 6= 0 representation Ũs is irreducible as follows from the proof of theorems
3.8, 3.9, since the linear span of non-linear functionals exp(i < F, β(ψ) >) is
dense in L2 (F(Y ), ν, C) (see also §4 in [38]). For X = M with dimL M < ∞
and s 6= 0 the representations Ũs and Us2 µ in L2 (ΓM , Pµ , C) are equivalent,
                             R
since (Ũs ψΦ0 , Φ0 ) = exp( M (ρ1/2 (ψ, x)−1)µ(dx)) = us2 (ψ), where Φ0 (F ) = 1
for each F ∈ F(ΓM ), Φ0 ∈ L2 (F(ΓM ), ν, C).
     3.16. Note.It follows from [5, 28, 37], that on Z there are infinite fam-
ilies of orthogonal measures, restrictions of which on U are quasi-invariant
relative to G′ and have continuous quasi-invariance factor on G′ × X, where
either X = M or X = G respectively, W ′ U ⊂ V , W ′ is open in G′ and U
is open in Z. Due to the general procedures of construction of measures on
X outlined above on infinite-dimensional M over the corresponding field or
on G there are infinite families of orthogonal and as well singular measures,
since measures on these infinite-dimensional manifolds M and G are induced
from the corresponding Banach spaces Z due to the local diffeomorphisms
A : W → V , where W is open in M or G and V is open in Z. Therefore, the
last two theorems show that there exists an infinite family of non-equivalent
unitary representations of G′ for X = G and also for G′ = Dif f t (M) for the
infinite-dimensional manifold M over the corresponding field, since in these
cases on G and M there exist infinite families of orhtogonal measures. The


                                       32
unitary group U(l2 ) of the standard Hilbert space l2 over C has the topolog-
ical density c, when U(l2 ) is in its standard topolgy induced by the operator
norm in the space of linear bounded operators L(l2 ) on l2 , since l2N in the box
topology has a density ℵℵ0 0 = c. When U(l2 ) is considered as a topological
space in its strong topology [9], then its topological density is ℵ0 , since l2N in
the product Tychonoff topology has density ℵ0 [7]. Therefore, the cardinality
of distinct unitary strongly continuous representations T : G′ → U(l2 ) for
topological group with density ℵ0 do not exceed c, since cℵ0 = c [7]. This
is important difference of the theory of such non-locally compact topological
groups with the theory of compact groups. In the latter case all irreducible
unitary representations arise as irreducible components of the regular repre-
sentation associated with the Haar measure, but for the considered here cases
of groups this is not true, since there are infinite families of non-equivalent
unitary representations on such groups. There are considered M and G and
Γ̃X with countable bases of topology and real-valued measures. The family
Ψ of distinct σ-additive Borel measures on these spaces have the cardinal-
ity card(Ψ) = card(RN ) = card(R) =: c. In view of theorems 3.10, 3.13,
3.14 and the criteria of orthogonality and singularity of measures on infinite-
dimensional spaces (using weak distributions, product measures, Kakutani
theorem and its non-Archimedean analog [5, 28] and the construction of
measures on G or Γ̃X with the help of local diffeomorphisms of open sub-
sets in these spaces and neigbourhoods of zero in the corresponding Banach
spaces as in §2.9) there exist families Ψs of singular and Ψo of orthogonal
measures such that c ≤ card(Ψo ) ≤ card(Ψs ) ≤ card(Ψ) = c, hence there
are c non-equivalent unitary representations Um of G′ in L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) and
also c inequivalent unitary representations of G′ in L2 (G, µ, C), which were
considered above, since card(Ψs ) = c.
    3.17. Theorem. There exist Abelian non-locally compact Banach-Lie
groups G with quasi-invariant measures µ on G relative to dense subgroups
G′ such that the associated regular unitary representations T µ of G′ are irre-
ducible, each one-parameter subgroup S of G is compact and a projection of
µ on each one-parameter subgroup S is equivalent with the Haar measure on
S.
    Proof. Let l2,b be a Hilbert space over R of elements x = (xj : j ∈
                                      P
N, xj ∈ R) such that kxk2l2,b := j |xj j b |2 < ∞. In particular l2 = l2,0 .
These spaces have standard orthonormal bases ek := (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ...) with


                                        33
1 on the k-th place, k ∈ N. For a local field L let c0,b be a Banach space
of elements x = (xj : j ∈ N, xj ∈ L) such that kxk := maxj |xj |L pjb < ∞
and limj→∞ |xj |pjb = 0, where p is a prime number such that L is a finite
algebraic extension of the field of p-adic numbers Qp . In particular c0,0 = c0 .
If b > 1 (with p−b ∈ Γ′ L in the non-Archimedean case) then the embeddings
Jb : l2,b ֒→ l2 and Sb : c0,b ֒→ c0 are of trace class: Jb ek = ak ek with
                     P                                                       P
ak = k −b ∈ R and k |ak | < ∞, Sb ek = vk ek with vk ∈ L and k |vk | < ∞,
where |vk | = p−jb . On l2 and c0 there exist a Gaussian measure λ and a non-
Archimedean analog η of a Gaussian measure quasi-invariant relative to l2,b
and c0,b respectively such that their projections λk and ηk on one-dimensional
subspaces Rek and Lek are the following: λk (dxk ) = Ck exp(−x2k s2k )w(dxk )
and ηk (dyk ) = Fk exp(−|yk |2 p2k )v(dyk ), where w and v are the Lebesgue
and the Haar measures on R and L respectively such that w([0, 1]) = 1,
                                 ′
v(B(L, 0, 1)) = 1, sk = k b for each k ∈ N with 1 < b′ < b, Ck > 0,
Fk > 0, λk (R) = 1, ηk (L) = 1 (see [5, 28]). Consider an additive discrete
subgroup E of l2,b consisting of elements x ∈ l2,b such that xj = nj ej for
each j ∈ N, where nj ∈ Z. Then l2,b /E =: Hb and l2 /E =: H are the
additive groups. The measures λ and η induce measures µ on H and ν on
B(c0 , 0, 1) := {x ∈ c0 : kxk ≤ 1} =: B. Then µ is quasi-invariant relative
to Hb and ν is quasi-invariant relative to B(c0,b , 0, 1) with continuous quasi-
invariance factors such that µ(H) = 1 and ν(B) > 0.
    Let Ln := spR (e1 , ..., en ) and En := Ln ∩ E, so the latter is a discrete
subgroup of Ln and Ln /En =: Vn is a closed subgroup of Hb . Hence a pro-
jection πn : l2,b → Ln , which has a continuous extension πn : l2 → Ln induces
a quotient mapping π̄n : Hb → Vn with a continuous extension π̄n : H → Vn
for each n ∈ N. Therefore, the measure µ on H induces a measure µn on Vn
such that µn (A) := µ(π̄n−1(A)) for each A ∈ Bf (Vn ). In view of the equality
limn→∞ ρµn (π̄n (ψ), π̄n (x)) = ρµ (ψ, x) for each ψ ∈ Hb and x ∈ H it follows
                            P           P
that ρµ (ψ, x) = limn→∞ ( z∈En exp{ nl=1 [2(ψ + z, el )(x, el ) − (ψ + z, el )2 ]s2l })
 P            Pn
( z∈En exp{ l=1 [2(z, el )(x, el ) − (z, el )2 ]s2l })−1 , since (πn (x), el ) = (x, el ) for
each x ∈ Ln with n ≥ l. The Hilbert space L2 (H, µ, C) is isomorphic with a
subspace {f : f ∈ L2 (l2 , λ, C); f (x + z) = f (x) λ-a.e. for each z ∈ E}. Since
       1/2
spC {ρλ (ψ, x) =: φ(x)|ψ ∈ l2,b } is dense in L2 (l2 , λ, C), then spC {ρ1/2         µ    =:
                                 2
φ(x)|ψ ∈ Hb } is dense in L (H, µ, C). Repeating the proof of theorem 3.8
for these groups we get that their regular unitary representations are irre-
ducible. That is representations T of l2,b , Hb , c0,b and B(c0,b , 0, 1) in the


                                             34
corresponding spaces L2 (l2 , λ, C), L2 (H, µ, C), L2 (c0 , η, C) and L2 (B, ν, C)
(the first case was also considered more generally for additive groups of lo-
cally convex spaces in [1, 10]). These groups are Banach-Lie and Abelian,
moreover, each one-parameter subgroup of Hb and of B(c0,b , 0, 1) over R and
L respectively is compact. The projections of µ and ν on one-parameter
subgroups are equivalent with the Haar measures on them. Certainly, Hb
and B(c0,b , 0, 1) are not locally compact, since Te Hb and Te B(c0,b , 0, 1) are
infinite-dimensional Banach spaces over R and L respectively.
    3.18. Note. Regular representations Um of the groups l2,b , Hb , c0,b or
B(c0,b , 0, 1) from the proof of theorem 3.17 in the space L2 (Γ̃X , Pm , C) with
X = l2 , H, c0 or B and m = λ, µ, η or ν respectively are reducible, since
D n Lh = 0 for each n > 1 and f0 is not cyclic for Um (see the proof of theorem
3.9).
