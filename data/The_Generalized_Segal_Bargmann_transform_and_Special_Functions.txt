                                                     Abstract. Analysis of function spaces and special functions are closely related to
                                                     the representation theory of Lie groups. We explain here the connection between
                                                     the Laguerre functions, the Laguerre polynomials, and the Meixner-Pollacyck poly-
                                                     nomials on the one side, and highest weight representations of Hermitian Lie groups
                                                     on the other side. The representation theory is used to derive differential equations
                                                     and recursion relations satisfied by those special functions.

                                             The broad subject of special functions is closely related to the representation theory
                                             of Lie groups and arises very naturally in analysis, number theory, combinatorics,
                                             and mathematical physics. The classical texts [51, 52] by Vilenkin and Vilenkin and
                                             Klimyk well document this interplay. The interested reader is also referred to [9] by
                                             Dieudonné and the recent text [1] by Andrews, Askey, and Roy. It is not our aim to
                                             add to this discussion in a general way, but mainly to concentrate on our specific work
                                             [5, 6, 7, 8] on the Meixner-Pollacyck polynomials, Laguerre functions, and Laguerre
                                             polynomials defined on symmetric cones. It is in the interplay among the various
                                             function spaces that model unitary highest weight representation for a Hermitian
                                             group that new results involving difference equations, differential equations, recursion
                                             formulas, and generating functions arise.
                                                The classical Laguerre polynomials Lαn (x) can be defined in several different ways.
                                             One of the oldest definitions is in terms of the generating function
                                                                                                ∞
                                                                                                  X
                                                                   −α−1              xw
                                             (0.1)       (1 − w)          exp                 =         Lαn (x)w n ,   |w| < 1, −1 < α .
                                                                                    w−1           n=0


                                               Another way is to use the Rodriguez type formula


                                                                                            ex x−α dn −x n+α

(0.5)                                  ℓαn (x) = Lαn (2x)e−x
form an orthonormal basis for L2 (R+ , dµα), where dµα (x) = xα dx.
    As was noted in [7], Theorem 3.1, a simple calculation shows that the functions
                                            {ℓαn , n ∈ N}
have Laplace transform

which forms a basis for the space of SO(2)-finite vectors in a holomorphic discrete
series of a conjugate version of SL(2, R). These representation theoretic relationships
are the basic starting point in [8] and will be described in the following sections. In
short let Ω ⊂ Rd be a symmetric cone and let T (Ω) = Ω + iRd be the corresponding
tube domain. Let Gc be a connected semisimple Lie group, locally isomorphic to the
connected component containing the identity of the group of holomorphic automor-
phisms of T (Ω). We use a natural orthogonal set of K-finite vectors in the Hilbert
space, Hν (T (Ω)), of holomorphic functions corresponding to a highest weight repre-
sentation of Gc and the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform, Lν , defined in [39]
to define an orthogonal set {ℓνm (x)}m on the space L2 (T (Ω), dµν ) for an appropriate
measure dµν (x). A generalization of (0.3) was used in [15], p. 343, to define Laguerre
polynomials, Lνm , for arbitrary symmetric cones and the following relationship was
obtained:
(0.6)                               ℓνm (x) = e− Tr(x) Lνm (2x) .
Applying the same ideas to the bounded realization of T (Ω) gives a natural general-
ization of the Meixner-Pollacyck polynomials, [8], Section 5. Most of the main results
in [6, 7, 8] concern the differential and difference relations among these special func-
tions. Several authors have used the relation between highest weight modules and the
Meixner-Pollacyck polynomials/Laguerre polynomials. In particular, we would like
to mention [17, 18, 25, 28, 29, 33, 55, 56, 57] as related references, but as far as the
authors know, the first time the Laguerre polynomials show up as coefficient functions

Laguerre polynomials to coefficient functions of representations of the group

                               1. Tube type domains
In this section we introduce the necessary notation and facts related to Hermitian
Lie groups and bounded symmetric domains D, containing the origin 0 ∈ Cd . Even
if much of what we say is valid for all bounded symmetric domains in Cd we will
assume from the beginning, as our applications will be restricted to that case, that
D is isomorphic to a tube type domain T (Ω). There exists a connected semisimple
Lie group that acts transitively on D. For simplicity we will assume that G is simple.
The general situation can be reduced to this case by considering direct products. Let
K = {g ∈ G | g ·0 = 0} . Then K is a maximal compact subgroup of G and D ≃ G/K.
Furthermore there exists an involution θ : G → G, a Cartan involution, such that
                            K = Gθ = {g ∈ G | θ(g) = g} .
In particular D is a Riemannian symmetric space. In this case Rd has the structure
of an Euclidean Jordan algebra with identity element e, [15], and Ω = {x2 | x ∈
Rd }0 where the subscript 0 stands for the connected components containing e. The
isomorphism D ≃ T (Ω) is then given by the Cayley transform
                                                        e+z
                            c(z) = (e + z)(e − z)−1 =        .
                                                        e−z
Let gC = g⊗R C denote the complexification of g and denote by GC a simply connected
and connected complex Lie group with Lie algebra gC . Then g · z is well defined for
g ∈ GC and almost all z ∈ Cd and (g1 g2 )·z = g1 ·(g2 ·z) whenever defined. In particular
there exists an element c ∈ GC such that c · z = c(z) for all z ∈ D. Assuming that
G ⊂ GC we set Gc = cGc−1 . Then Gc acts transitively on T (Ω) and the stabilizer of
e ∈ Ω is given by K c = cKc−1 . Finally, there exists a conjugation σ : Cd → Cd which
lifts to an involution τ : GC → GC such that, with H = Gτ0 , we have
                               DR := {z ∈ D | σ(z) = z}
is a totally real Riemannian subsymmetric space, isomorphic to H/H ∩ K. We can
choose σ so that the Cayley transform maps DR bijectively onto Ω. Notice that θ and
τ commute and hence
                               g = k⊕p=h⊕q
                                 = hk ⊕ hp ⊕ q k ⊕ q p
4                       MARK DAVIDSON AND GESTUR ÓLAFSSON

where p = {X ∈ g | θ(X) = −X}, q = {X ∈ g | τ (X) = −X}, and a subscript k
(respectively p ) indicates intersection with k (respectively p). Everything is now set
up so that τ (g) = c2 (g)(c−1)2 , gc = Ad(c)g, and the Lie algebra of Gc is given by
                                gc = hk ⊕ ihp ⊕ iqk ⊕ qp .
We note that K c := cKc−1 = HC ∩ Gc and H c = cHc−1 = KC ∩ Gc .
   The fact that D is an irreducible bounded symmetric domains implies that zk, the
center of k, is one dimensional. We can choose Z0 ∈ izk such that ad(Z0 ) : gC → gC
has eigenvalues 0, 1 and −1. The 0-eigenspace is exactly kC . Define p+ to be the
1-eigenspace and p− to be the −1-eigenspace. Then p+ and p− are both abelian Lie
algebras, normalized by KC , and gC = p+ ⊕ kC ⊕ p− . Denote by P + = exp(p+ ) the
closed Lie subgroup of GC with Lie algebra p+ and similarly P − = exp(p− ). Then
P + × KC × P − ∋ (p, k, q) 7→ pkq ∈ GC is a diffeomorphism onto an open dense subset
of GC . Furthermore G ⊂ P + KC P − . For g ∈ P + KC P − we denote by p(g) ∈ P + ,
kC (g) ∈ KC , and q(g) ∈ P − the inverse of the above diffeomorphism. Then the
bounded realization of G/K inside p+ is given by
                         G/K ∋ gK 7→ (exp |p+ )−1 (p(g)) ∈ p+ .
  We will also need some basic information about roots. Let ak be a maximal abelian
subspace of qk . Then ak is in fact maximal abelian in q. Let ∆ be the set of roots of
(ak )C in gC and let ∆k be the set of roots of (ak )C in kC . Then
                               ∆k = {α ∈ ∆ | α(Z0 ) = 0}
Set ∆n = {α ∈ ∆ | α(Z0 ) 6= 0}. Then ∆n = ∆+    −
                                           n ∪ ∆n , disjoint union, where

                             ∆±
                              n = {α ∈ ∆ | α(Z0 ) = ±1} .

Recall that two roots α, β ∈ ∆ are called strongly orthogonal if α ± β 6∈ ∆. In our
situation there are only two root lengths. Choose a maximal set {γ1 , . . . , γr } of long
strongly orthogonal roots in ∆+n . Notice that r = dim ak . The above set of roots can
now be described as:
                                                    1
(1.1)               ∆±n   = ±[{γ1 , . . . , γr } ∪ { (γi + γj ) | i < j}]
                                                    2
                                1
(1.2)               ∆k = ±{ (γi − γj ) | i < j}]
                                2
We choose the ordering such that γ1 > . . . > γr > 0. Then the positive set of roots
are those with a ‘ +’ in the above equations. For α ∈ ∆ let
                                                  2(γ, α)
                                  sα : γ 7→ γ −           α
                                                  (α, α)
denote the corresponding Weyl group reflection. Here (·, ·) denotes a Weyl group
invariant inner product on ia∗k such that (γ1 , γ1) = 1. Notice that s(γi −γj )/2 (γi ) = γj
and sγi ((γi + γj )/2) = −(γi − γj )/2. It follows that all the root spaces (gC )γj have the
same dimension, which is in fact one, and also the spaces (gC )(γi ±γj )/2 have the same
dimension, which we denote by a.
    Let Hj ∈ iak be such that γi (Hj ) = 2δij . Then iak = ⊕rj=1 RHj and Z = 21 (H1 +
. . . + Hr ). Let a = Ad(c)(ak ) = Ad(c)−1 ak . Then a is maximal abelian in hp and p.

The roots of a in g are given by ∆a = ∆ ◦ Ad(c). We set:
                             ξj = Ad(c)−1 Hj
                              ξ = ξ1 + . . . + ξr = 2Ad(c)−1 Z0
                             βj = γj ◦ Ad(c) .
           Lr
Then a =     j=1 Rξj   and ξ is central in h. We use β1 , . . . , βr to identify a∗C with Cr by
                              (λ1 , . . . , λr ) 7→ λ1 β1 + . . . + λr βr .
We also embed C into a∗C by λ 7→ λ(β1 + . . . + βr ).
  If G is simple, then by the classification the triple (G, K, H) is locally isomorphic
to one of the following:

  Here the subscript    +   stands for the real and positive determinant.
Example 1.1 (Symmetric Matrices). Let Rd = Sym(n, R), d = n(n + 1)/2, be the
real space of n × n real symmetric matrices. The complexification of Rd is then the
space of n × n complex symmetric matrices Sym(n, C). Obviously Sym(n, C) is a
complex Jordan algebra, where the product is given by X · Y := (XY + Y X)/2.
Furthermore,
                           Ω = {X ∈ Sym(n, R) | X > 0} ,
where > stands for positive definite. The action of GL(n, R) on Sym(n, R) is given
by
                                   g · X = gXg T .
The orbits are parametrized by the signature. In particular, the cone of positive
definite matrices is homogeneous. The identity element is just the usual identity
matrix In ∈ Ω and the stabilizer of In is SO(n).
  Write an element g ∈ Sp(n, R) as

                                          A B
                                   g=            .
                                          C D
Then the action of Sp(n, R) on T (Ω) is given by
(1.3)                          g · Z = (AZ + B)(CZ + D)−1 .
Notice that (1.3) in fact defines an almost everywhere defined action of Sp(n, R)C =
Sp(n, C) on Sym(n, C). We have
                            D = {X ∈ Sym(n, C) | In − Z ∗ Z > 0}
and the Cayley transform is given by
                                                                         

                                                                   −In In

Define σ : Sym(n, C) → Sym(n, C) to be the usual complex conjugation. Then
DR = {Z ∈ Sym(n, R) | In − Z 2 > 0} and a simple calculation shows that c(X) ∈ Ω
for X ∈ DR as was to be expected.
   The case Rd = {Z ∈ M(n, C) | Z ∗ = Z}, G = SU(n, n) and H = GL(n, C)+ is
treated is the same way. Notice that in this case the complexification of Rd is given by
RdC = M(n, C) as every complex matrix can be written in an unique way as Z = X +iY
with X = X ∗ and Y + Y ∗ . Simply set X = 1/2(Z + Z ∗ ) and Y = 1/(2i)(Z − Z ∗ ).
   We refer to [15, 32, 50] for further information on the structure of bounded sym-
metric domains and the relation between bounded symmetric domains and Jordan
algebras. For the more group theoretical description we refer to [21, 30, 31]. The
connection between Hermitian symmetric spaces and causal symmetric spaces G/H
is described in [23].

                      2. Highest weight representations
The unitary highest weight representations of G are well understood unitary repre-
sentations that can be realized in a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on D.
The idea described in this section is to use the Restriction principle, introduced in
[39] (see also [36, 41]), to construct the Berezin transform and generalized Segal-
Bargmann transform and to transfer information known from the highest weight
representations to extract information about L2 (DR ) and L2 (Ω, dµν ), where µν is a
measure on Ω to be introduced in a moment. Thus: We want to use the highest
weight representations to do harmonic analysis on bounded real domains and sym-
metric cones. It should be noted that almost all Riemannian symmetric spaces can
be realized as a real form of a Hermitian symmetric spaces. We will in this section
give a brief introduction to the theory of highest weight representations. We refer to
[13, 14, 20, 22, 24, 34, 40, 46, 45, 53] for more information.
   Let p = 2d/r, and let J(g, z) be the complex Jacobian determinant of the action
of G on D. If we are discussing the tube type realization, then we will use the
same notation for the complex Jacobian determinant of the action of Gc on T (Ω).
The map (g, z) 7→ J(g, z) can be expressed in terms of the KC -projection (g, z) 7→
kC (g exp(z)) ∈ KC and

Let ∆ be the determinant function on the Jordan algebra, Rd , and Tr the trace
functional. In the case Rd = Sym(n, R) this is just the usual determinant function and
trace. We denote by ∆j the principal minors. Recall that ∆r = ∆. For (α1 , . . . , αr ) ∈
Cr let

Let h(z, w) = ∆(e − z w̄). Finally, we define the Gindikin-Koecher gamma function

where Γ is the usual Γ-function. For m ∈ Λ := {(m1 , . . . , mr ) ∈ Nr0 | m1 ≥ m2 ≥

weight −m. Denote by P (Cr ) the space of polynomial functions on Cr , Then τm can
be realized (with multiplicity one) in a subspace Pm (Cr ) ⊂ P (Cr ). Furthermore (see
[47])
                                           M

   There is a canonical series of highest weight representations (or weighted Bargmann
spaces in some cases)

the so-called Berezin-Wallach set. To simplify the notation for the moment write Hν
for Hν (D). The space Hν is a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on D. For
ν > a(r − 1) + 1 the norm is given by
                           Z
                   2                                       1     ΓΩ (ν)

In this case, if we assume that the center of G is finite, the representation (πν , Hν )
can be realized as a discrete summand in L2 (G) ([20]) and L2 (G/H) ([37, 38]). For
ν < a(r − 1) + 1 we use analytic continuation of this norm. The representation of G
on Hν is given by
                                                        ν
(2.4)                        πν (g)F (z) = J(g −1 , z) p F (g −1 z) .
  The facts that we will need are:
Theorem 2.1. Let the notation be as above. Then the following holds:
  (1) Hν is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with reproducing kernel
                    Kw (z) = K(z, w) = h(z, w)−ν = ∆(e − z w̄)−ν .
   (2) If ν > (r − 1) a2 then the space of polynomials P (Cd ) is dense in Hν . More
       specifically, the space of K-finite vectors (Hν )K can be naturally identified with
       P (Cd )
   (3) All of the K-representations (τm , Pm (Cd )) are K ∩ H-spherical and

     (5) The norm of the function ψm is given by

  Notice that (1) means that the point evaluations are continuous linear functionals
on Hν and
                         F (z) = (F |Kz ) for all F ∈ Hν .

       3. The Berezin transform and generalized Segal-Bargmann
                               transform
In this section we recall the basic facts about the Berezin transform and generalized
Segal-Bargmann transform. We refer to [2, 12, 10, 11, 19, 27, 35, 36, 39, 41, 48, 49]
for further information. We define a map, the restriction map, (see [39]) Rν : Hν →
C ∞ (DR ) by
                                                ν
                                Rν F (x) = h(x) 2 F (x),
where h(x) = h(x, x). Then Rν is injective. Since the invariant measure dη on DR is
                p
dη(x) = h(x)− 2 dx (and a few other things) we get
Lemma 3.1. Rν F ∈ L2 (DR , dη) for all F ∈ P (Cd ) if and only if ν > a2 (r − 1).
    Thus the restriction map
                           Rν : (Hν )K = P (Cd) → L2 (DR , dη)
is defined for all ν in the continuous part of the Berezin-Wallach set. We collect the
important properties in the following theorem (see [8], section 3):
Theorem 3.2. Assume that ν > a2 (r − 1). Then the following hold:
  (1) Rν (P (Cd )) is dense in L2 (DR , dη).
  (2) Rν : Hν → L2 (DR , dη) is closed.
  (3) The Berezin transform Rν Rν∗ is given by
                       Z        ν      ν
             ∗             h(y) 2 h(x) 2
        Rν Rν f (y) =                    f (x) dη(x) = Dν ⋆ f (h) (y = h · 0),
                        DR   h(y, x)ν
                                ν
         where Dν (h) = J(h, 0) p .
     (4) If ν > a(r − 1) then Rν Rν∗ : L2 (DR , dη) → L2 (DR , dη) is continuous with norm
         ||Rn Rn∗ ||2 ≤ ||Dν ||L1 < ∞.
     (5) If ν > a(r − 1) then Rν Rν∗ : L∞ (DR , dη) → L∞ (DR , dη) is continuous with
         norm ||Rn Rn∗ ||∞ ≤ ||Dν ||L1 < ∞.
   We are thus able to apply Rν Rν∗ to bounded spherical functions! The proof of (3)
is standard:
                         Rν∗ f (z) = (Rv∗ f |Kz )
                                   = (f |Rv Kz )
                                     Z
                                                   ν
                                   =     f (x)h(x) 2 h(y, x)−ν dη.
                    THE GENERALIZED SEGAL-BARGMANN TRANSFORM                          9

This implies                              Z
                                                        ν        ν
                       Rν Rν∗ f (y)   =       f (x)h(y) 2 h(x) 2 h(y, z)−ν dη.
In particular, this shows that the restriction principle defined in [39] results in the
Berezin transform.
  For ν > a2 (r − 1), the restriction map Rν : Hν → L2 (DR , dη) is closed with dense
image. We can therefore define a unitary isomorphism Uν : L2 (DR , dη) → Hν by
polarization. Thus Uν satisfies
                                            p
                                    Rν∗ = Uν Rν Rν∗ .
The map Uν is the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform. Let c(ν) denote the Harish-
Chandra c-function, W the Weyl group corresponding to the root system ∆(a, h),
w = #W , and F the Harish -Chandra/ Helgason spherical Fourier transform
                                                 1 dλ W
                    F : L2 (DR , dη)H∩K → L2 (a,           )

                                           Z
                                      F 7→     F (x)ϕλ (x)dη(x)
                                                            DR

where ϕλ is the spherical functions on H/H ∩ K ≃ DR given by
                     ϕλ (x) = ψiλ+ρ ((e + x)(e − x)−1 ) = ψiλ+ρ (c(x)) .
Here ρ is half the sum of the positive roots for H/(H ∩ K). Then the above discussion
results in a unitary isomorphism
                                                          1 dλ W
                   F ◦ Uν∗ : P (Cr )K∩H = HH∩K
                                            ν    → L2 (a,           )

and we get:
Theorem 3.3. If ν > a2 (r − 1) then the functions
                                          {F ◦ Uν∗ (ψm )}m≥0
form an orthogonal basis for L2 (a, w1 |c(λ)|

                                                   .

                              4. The Polynomials pν,m (λ)
The next obvious task is to understand the functions F ◦ Uν∗ (ψm ). For that we define
the polynomials pν,m (λ) by
                                                                     ν
(4.1)                pν,m (λ) = kψm k−2 ψm (∂x )[∆(e − x2 )− 2 φλ (x)]x=0 ,
  We have:

                                          ν
                                                      X
                          ∆(e − x2 )− 2 φλ (x) =             pν,m (λ)ψm (x).
                                                        m

  We define the constants cν and bν by
                     cν = kDν kL1         and      Rν Rν∗ (ϕλ ) = c−1
                                                                   ν bν (λ)ϕλ .

The numbers cν and bν (λ) have been evaluated by Zhang, [56].

                                  5. Example: G = SU(1, 1)
                                                                      
                                                                   a b
Let D = {z ∈ C | |z| < 1}. Whenever defined we write for g =              ∈ GL(2, C)
                                                                   c d
and z ∈ D:
                                           az + b
                                   g·z =          .
                                           cz + d
Then, restricted to SU(1, 1), this defines a transitive action of SU(1, 1) on D. In
this case we take the conjugation σ as the usual complex conjugation z 7→ z̄. Then
DR = (−1, 1) and ψm (x) = xm . Notice that

and ht (0) = tanh(t). In particular K ∩ H = {Id} is trivial. As (1 + x)(1 − x)−1 is real
and positive for all x ∈ (−1, 1) we can define
                                                 ν 1 + x
                           Gν,λ (x) = (1 − x2 )− 2 (       )iλ .
                                                     1−x
Then we can expand Gν,λ as
                                           ∞
                                           X

  The connection to the representation πν is as follows. We have ξ =                        ∈h
                                                                                  1 0

The general recurrence relation corresponding to (5.1) and difference relation gen-
eralizing (5.2) are as follows: Choose Z0 ∈ zkC as before, i.e., such that ad(Z0 ) has
eigenvalues 0, 1, and −1. As before set ξ = Ad(c)(−2Z0 ) = Ad(c)−1 (2Z0 ). Denote by
ek the standard basis vector of Rr with a 1 in each k-th position and 0’s elsewhere.
For n an r-tuple define
                                           Y nk − nj + a (j − k − 1)

                           := (nk + (r − k))                 a
                 n − ek            2              nk − nj + 2 (j − k)
                                             j6=k

and
                                             Y nk − nj − a (j − k − 1)
                                                          2
                                 cn (k) =                   a          .

Then
Theorem 6.1 ([8],Theorem 5.2). With the above notation we have:

                          j=1                            j=1

  Let qm,ν (z) = ∆(z + e)−ν ψm ((z − e)(z + e)−1 ). Since ξ = −2Ad(Z0 ) and Z0 is
central in k it follows, by some calculations, that:
         πν (ξ)qm,ν = (rν + 2km|)qm,ν
                      Xr                     Xr
                              m                             a
    πν (−2Z0 )qm,ν =                qm−ej ,ν −     (ν + nj − (j − 1))cm (j)qm+ej ,ν .
                           m − ej                           2
                      j=1                      j=1

Putting those pieces together we get:

the pν,m (λ):

                          7. The Unbounded Realization
In this section we discuss the unbounded realization D ≃ T (Ω) = iRd + Ω. This can
be used to study recurrence and differential equations for Laguerre polynomials and
functions on Ω. We refer to [8, 15, 44] for further references.
   From now on ν ∈ C is identified with ν(β1 + . . . + βr ) ∈ a∗ . Using the Cayley
transform we get a space of holomorphic functions on T (Ω), Hν (T (Ω)) = πν (c)Hν ,
and get an orthonormal basis
                                                       z−e
                            qm,ν (z) = ∆(z + e)−ν ψm (     )
                                                       z+e
                                                                              m
    e H∩K . Notice that these functions correspond to the functions z → (z−i)ν+m
for H                                                                            on
        ν                                                                        (z+i)
the upper half plane in the case G = SL(2, R). Let us describe this in more detail,
as the standard normalization for the unbounded realization is usually different from
the one in the bounded realization. For ν > 1 + a(r − 1) let Hν (T (Ω)) be the space
of holomorphic functions F : T (Ω) → C such that
                             Z
                     2
(7.1)            kF kν := βν      |F (x + iy)|2∆(y)ν−2d/r dxdy < ∞
                                 T (Ω)

where
                                                2rν
(7.2)                            βν =                       .
                                         (4π)d ΓΩ (ν − d/r)
Then Hν (T (Ω)) is a non-trivial Hilbert space. For ν ≤ 1 + a(r − 1) this space reduces
to {0} and analytic continuation is again used to define the norm [44]. If ν = 2d/r
this is the Bergman space.
  Instead of using the H c -invariant measure on the cone Ω we use a weighted measure
dµν (x) = ∆(x)ν−d/r dx corresponding to the measure xν−1 dx on R+ . Thus we get the
weighted L2 -spaces
                                                        d
                              L2ν (Ω) = L2 (Ω, ∆(x)ν− r dx).
In this normalization the restriction map is simply Rν F = F |Ω and the unitary part
becomes the Laplace transform Lν . We define Lν on the domain
                                        Z
                            2
                    {f ∈ Lν (Ω, dµν ) |    e−(ω,x) |f (x)|dµν (x) < ∞}
                                            Ω
for all ω ∈ Ω by                            Z
                            Lν (f )(z) :=       e−(z,x) f (x)dµν (x) .
                                            Ω
Note that by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the condition f ∈ L2ν (Ω) implies, since
|e−(s+it,x) | = e−(s,x) , that Lν f is a well-defined function on T (Ω). To simplify notation
we sometimes write R for Rν and L for Lν . Denote by LΩ = Rν ◦ Lν . Then LΩ is a
self-adjoint positive operator L2 (Ω, dµν ) → L2 (Ω, dµν ).
Theorem 7.1. Let the notation be as above. Assume that ν > 1 + a(r − 1). Then
the following hold:

   (1) The space Hν (T (Ω)) is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
   (2) The map

                    Ψν := p          πν (c)−1 : Hν (T (Ω)) → Hν (D)
                              ΓΩ (ν)
       is a unitary isomorphism.
   (3) The reproducing kernel of Hν (T (Ω)) is given by
                            Kν (z, w) = ΓΩ (ν)∆ (z + w̄)−ν
   (4) If ν > (r − 1) a2 then there exists a Hilbert space Hν (T (Ω)) of holomorphic
       functions on T (Ω) such that Kν (z, w) defined in (2) is the reproducing kernel
       of that Hilbert space and the universal covering group of Gc acts unitarily and
       irreducibly on Hν (T (Ω)).
   (5) The map
                         L2ν (Ω) ∋ f 7→ F = Lν (f ) ∈ Hν (T (Ω))
       is a unitary isomorphism and
   (6) If ν > (r − 1) a2 then the functions

        form an orthogonal basis of Hν (T (Ω))L , the space of L-invariant functions in
        Hν (T (Ω)).
   The proof of (5) follows from a restriction principle argument. Let f ∈ L2ν (Ω) be
in the domain of RR∗ , then
                     RR∗ f (y) = R∗ f (y)
                              = (R∗ f | Ky )Hν (T (Ω))
                              = (f, RKy )L2ν (Ω)
                                Z
                              =     f (x)K(x, y) dµν (x)
                                 Ω

(7.3)                         = ΓΩ (ν) f (x)∆(x + y)−ν dµν (x)
                                         Ω
                                Z
                              =     f (x)LΩ (e−(y,·) )(x) dµν (x)
                                ZΩ
                              =     e−(y,x) ∆(x)ν−d/r LΩ (f )(x) dx
                                  Ω
                              = LΩ (LΩ f )(y),
and
                           (LΩ f, LΩ f ) = (R∗ f, R∗ f ) < ∞.
Thus f is in the domain of (LΩ )2 and RR∗ = (LΩ )2 . Therefore (LΩ )2 is a self-adjoint
extension of RR∗ , which is also self-adjoint by the von Neumann theorem.
  Consider the inverse operator R−1 acting on the image of R. For a function g in
the image of R, R−1 g is the unique extension of g to a holomorphic function on T (Ω).
14                       MARK DAVIDSON AND GESTUR ÓLAFSSON

Thus R−1 LΩ = Lν . Letting R−1 act on the previous equality (7.3) we get
                                         R∗ f = Lν LΩ f.
This proves the polar decomposition formula. Since R∗ is densely defined and R is
an injective closed operator we have that the unitary part Lν extends to a unitary
operator. Thus we get the well known fact, first proved by Rossi and Vergne [44] for
the full Wallach set:
Theorem 7.2. Let ν > a(r − 1)/2. Then the Laplace transform L : L2 (Ω, dµν ) →
Hν (T (Ω)                     Z
                          L(f )(z) =         e−(z,x) f (x)∆(x)ν−d/r dx
                                         Ω
is an unitary isomorphism.
  Combinging Theorem 7.2 and Theorem 7.1, part 2, we get the following simple,
but usefull fact:
Lemma 7.3. The map Ξ = Ξν : L2 (Ω, dµν ) → H(D)ν ,

                                 ΓΩ (ν) Ω
is a unitary isomorphism.

                  8. The Laguerre Polynomials and Functions
In this section ν will stand for a complex number identified with the element ν(β1 +
. . . + βr ) ∈ a∗ . We define, as in [15] (c.f. equation (0.3) in the Introduction), the
Laguerre polynomials by
                                          X m 1
                           ν
                         Lm (x) = (ν)m                   ψ (−x)
                                                 n (ν)n n
                                             |n|≤|m|

and the Laguerre functions
                                  ℓνm (x) = e−Tr(x) Lνm (2x)
where
                                                ΓΩ (λ + m)
                                   (ν)m =                  .
                                                  ΓΩ (λ)
Then
Theorem 8.1 ([8] Theorem 7.8).
                                Lν (ℓνm ) = ΓΩ (m + ν)qm,ν .
In particular, it follows that {ℓνm }m is an orthogonal basis for L2 (Ω, dµν )H∩K .
                                          ( dr )m
     It follows from the fact kψm k2 =   dm (ν)m
                                                    and Lemma 7.3, that

  Furthermore the action πν (2Z0 ) and πν (ζ) translates into:
Theorem 8.3 ([8], Theorem  7.9).    
                      P  r       m                                P

  (2) πν (ζ)ℓm = (rν + 2|m|)ℓm .
   There are some things that remain to be done. First, one can show that gC ≃
sl(2, C) ≃ CX − ⊕ CX + ⊕ CZ0 , where X − ∈ p+ corresponds to an annihilating
operator, X + ∈ p− corresponds to a creation operator, and Z0 ∈ kC corresponds to
the Laguerre operator, when viewed as operators on L2 (Ω, dµν ). The problem is to
find explicit formula as second order differential operators and the full representation
of gC on L2 (Ω, dµν ). This has been worked out for G = SU(n, n)[6].
Theorem 8.4 ([6], Theorem 6.1). For the cone of positive definite Hermitian matrices
we have

       1))ℓνm−ej
                                                  P
   (3) 21 tr(−s∇∇ + (−νI + 2s)∇ + (vI − s))ℓνm = rj=1 cm (j)ℓνm+ej .
  These formulas generalize the classical relations
   (1) (tD 2 + νD − t)ℓvn = −(2n + ν)ℓνn
   (2) (tD 2 + (2t + ν)D + (t + ν))ℓνn = −2(n + ν − 1)ℓνn−1
   (3) (tD 2 − (2t − ν)D + (t − ν))ℓνn = −2(n + 1)ℓνn+1 .

        9. The generating function for the Laguerre polynomials
Recall equation (0.1)
                                                  ∞
                                                    X
                     −α−1              xw
(9.1)      (1 − w)          exp                 =         Lαn (x)w n ,   |w| < 1, −1 < α .
                                      w−1           n=0

from the introduction. Let us rewrite this using our notation ν = α + 1 and ℓαm (x) =
Lαm (2x)e−x . By replacing in (9.1) x by 2x and multiplying both sides by exp(−x) we
obtain
                                              X  ∞
                                ν       1+w
(9.2)                   (1 − w) exp x           =     ℓνm (x)w m
                                        1−w       m=0

We will now show how to generalize (9.2) using the connection with the highest weight
modules.
   Suppose H is an arbitrary highest weight space for a unitary representation of G
                              +
isomorphic to Hν . Let V = Hp be the lowest K-type. In other words
                        V = {v ∈ H | X · v = 0, for all X ∈ p+ } .
16                            MARK DAVIDSON AND GESTUR ÓLAFSSON

In this case V = Cv◦ is one dimensional and we can thus identify H and C. Assume
v◦ has norm 1. For each T ∈ p+ we define a map qT : H → H by the formula
                                         X∞
                                             Tn · v
                                qT (v) =            .
                                         m=0
                                              n!
We have the following
Theorem 9.1 ([4] Theorems 5.1, 7.1 and 7.2).
  (1) The series that defines qT converges in H if and only if T ∈ D.
  (2) The map Ξ : H → Hν given by
                                       Ξξ(T ) = qT∗ ξ,     T ∈D
         is a unitary isomorphism that intertwines the G-actions.
     (3) In the case H = Hν we have V = C1, where 1 is the constant function, and
                              (qT 1, F ) = (1, F (T )) = F (T ),     T ∈ D.
  In the case where H = L2 (Ω, dµν ) the map Ξ is given in Lemma 7.3:
                                   1
                 Ξ(f )(w) = p            πν (c)−1 L(f )(w)
                                  ΓΩ (ν)
                               s         Z
                                   2rν
                            =                e−(cw,x)f (x)∆(x)ν−d/r dx
                                  ΓΩ (ν) Ω
                                                   q rν
The highest weight space is H = Cℓν◦ . Let v◦ = Γ2Ω (ν) ℓν◦ . Then v◦ has norm 1 and
Ξv◦ is the constant function 1 on D.
Theorem 9.2 ([5]). Let E be a closed subspace of L2 (Ω, dµν ), {eα } an orthonormal
basis of E, and Eα = Ξ(eα ) ∈ Hν for each α. Let prE be the orthogonal projection of
L2 (Ω, dµν ) onto E. Then we have for w ∈ D and x ∈ Ω:
                                                      X
                    βν ∆(e − w)−ν prE (e−(c(w),x) ) =   Eα (w)eα (x),
                                                                α
               q
                    2rν
where βν =         ΓΩ (ν)
                            and the convergence is with respect to the Hilbert space norm in
 2
L (Ω, dµν ).
Proof. First we have
                                                    X
                                prE (qw (v◦ )) =         (qw (v◦ ), eα )eα
                                                     α
                                                    X
                                               =         (Ξqw v◦ , Ξeα )eα

                                                    X
                                               =         (qw Ξv◦ , Eα )eα
                                                     α
                                                    X

On the other hand,
                   (qw v◦ , f ) = (Ξqw v◦ , Ξf )
                                = (qw 1, Ξf )

                               = βν ∆(e −      w)−ν           e−(cw,x) f (x) dµν (x)

                               = βν ∆(e −      w)−ν (e−(cw,x), f )
From this it follows that

                             qw v◦ (x) = βν ∆(e − w)−ν e−(c(w),x) .
and                                                           X

The orthogonal projection prE : L2 (Ω, dµν ) → E is given by
                                        Z
                            prE (f ) =        f (kx) dk.
