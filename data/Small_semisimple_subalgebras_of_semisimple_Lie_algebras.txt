                                                                                  1. Introduction
                                               The main goal of this paper is to prove the following:
                                             Theorem (see [PZ04]). Let k be an sl2 -subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra g, none of
                                             whose simple factors is of type A1. Then there exists a positive integer b(k, g), such that
                                             for every irreducible finite dimensional g-module V , there exists an injection of k-modules
                                             W → V , where W is an irreducible k-module of dimension less than b(k, g).
                                                The goal of Section 2 is to provide a proof of Theorem 2.0.1. Section 3 introduces the
                                             necessary facts about Lie algebras and representation theory, with the goal being the proof
                                             of Proposition 3.5.7 (ultimately as an application of Theorem 2.0.1), and Proposition 3.3.1.
                                             In Section 4 we prove the main theorem, using Propositions 3.3.1 and 3.5.7. In Section 5,
                                             we apply the theorem to the special case where g is the exceptional Lie algebra G2 , and k is
                                             a principal sl2 -subalgebra of g. We obtain a sharp estimate of b(k, g) (in this case).

                                                                               2. Invariant theory.
                                               The context for this section lies in the theory of algebraic group actions on varieties. A
                                             good general reference for our terminology and notation is [Sha94] which contains translations
                                             of works, [PV89] and [Spr89]. For general notation and terminology from commutative
                                             algebra and algebraic geometry see [Eis95] and [Har77]. For the general theory of linear
                                             algebraic groups, see [Bor91].
                                               All varieties are defined over C, although we employ some results that are valid in greater
                                             generality. Unless otherwise stated, all groups are assumed to have the structure of a con-
                                             nected linear algebraic group. Of particular interest is the situation where a group, G, acts
                                             on an affine or quasi-affine variety. Given a (quasi-) affine variety, X, we denote the ring of
                                             regular functions on X, by C[X], and C[X]G denotes the ring of G-invariant functions.
                                               We now turn to the following:
                                             Problem. Let X be an irreducible (quasi-) affine variety. Let G be a algebraic group acting
                                             regularly on X. When is C[X]G ∼  6= C? That is to say, when do we have a non-trivial
                                             invariant?

                                               The general problem may be too hard in this generality. We begin by investigating a more
                                             restrictive situation which we describe next.
                                               For our purposes, a generic orbit, O ⊂ X, is defined to be an orbit of a point x ∈ X with
                                             minimal isotropy group (ie: Gx0 = {g ∈ G|g · x0 = x0 } for x0 ∈ X).
                                               Date: February 28, 2018.
                                                                                            1
Theorem 2.0.1. Assume that X is an irreducible quasi-affine variety with a regular action
by a linear algebraic group H such that:
   (1) A generic H-orbit, O, in X has dim O < dim X,
   (2) C[X] is factorial, and
   (3) H has no rational characters1.
Then, C[X]H ∼  6= C. Furthermore, trdeg C[X]H = codim O.
  This theorem will be used to prove Proposition 3.5.1. In order to provide a proof of the
above theorem we require some preparation. Let C(X) denote the field of complex valued
rational functions on X. Our plan will be to first look at the ring of rational invariants,
                                                                                       
C(X)H . Given an integral domain, R, let QR denote the quotient field. Clearly Q C[X]H ⊆
C(X)H . Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.0.1 we have equality. As is seen by:
Theorem 2.0.2 ([Sha94] p. 165). Suppose k(X) = Qk[X]. If either,
    (a) the group G0 is solvable2, or
    (b) the algebra k[X] is factorial,
then any rational invariant of the action G : X can be represented as a quotient of two integral
semi-invariants (of the same weight). If, in addition, G0 has no nontrivial characters (which
in case (a) means it is unipotent), then k(X)G = Q k[X]G .
   As one might expect from the hypothesis (2) of Theorem 2.0.1, our applications of Propo-
sition 2.0.2 will involve condition (b). We will then use:
Proposition 2.0.3 ([Sha94] p. 166). Suppose the variety X is irreducible. The algebra
k[X]G separates orbits in general position if and only if k(X)G = Qk[X]G , and in this case
there exists a finite set of integral invariants that separates orbits in general position and the
transcendence degree of k[X]G is equal to the codimension of an orbit in general position.
Proof of Theorem 2.0.1. In our situation X is a quasi-affine variety, thus k(X) = Qk[X].
By assumptions (2) and (3) of Theorem 2.0.1 and Theorem 2.0.2 (using part (b)) we have
that k(X)G = Q k[X]G . dim C[X]H = codim O follows from the irreducibility of X and
Proposition 2.0.3. By assumption (1), codim O > 0. Thus, C[X]H ∼  6= C.               
Question. For our purposes, we work within the context of the assumptions of Theorem 2.0.1,
but to what extent may we relax the assumptions to keep the conclusion of the theorem?

Consider a triple (G, S, H) such that the following conditions (∗) hold3
Conditions (∗).
  (1) G is a connected, simply-connected, semisimple linear algebraic group over C.
  (2) S and H are connected algebraic subgroups of G such that:
       (a) S ⊆ G, is a connected algebraic subgroup with no non-trivial rational characters.
      (b) H ⊆ G, is semisimple (and hence has no non-trivial rational characters).
  1A   rational character of H is defined to be a regular function χ : H → C× such that χ(xy) = χ(x)χ(y)
for all x, y ∈ H.
   2Notation: G0 denotes the connected component of G.
   3Throughout this article, we denote the Lie algebras of G and H by g and k, but we do not need this
notation at present.
                                                   2
For our situation we will require the following two results (used in Proposition 3.5.1):
Theorem 2.0.4 (Voskresenskiı̆ (see [Pop74], [Vos69], [Vos98])). If G is a connected, simply
connected, semisimple linear algebraic group then the ring of regular functions, C[G], is
factorial.
Theorem 2.0.5 (see [Sha94], page 176). If C[X] is factorial and the group S is connected
and has no nontrivial characters, then C[X]S is factorial.
   It is a theorem that G/S has the structure of a quasi-affine variety. Regarding the geo-
metric structure of the quotient we refer the reader to the survey in [PV89] Section 4.7. We
briefly summarize the main points: if G is an algebraic group with an algebraic subgroup
L ⊆ G then the quotient G/L has the structure of a quasiprojective variety. If G is reduc-
tive, then G/L is affine iff L is reductive; G/L is projective iff L is a parabolic subgroup (ie:
L contains a Borel subgroup of G). The condition of G/L being quasi-affine is more deli-
cate, but includes, for example, the case when L is the first derived subgroup of a parabolic
subgroup, which will be of particular interest in Section 3.4.
   A consequence of Theorems 2.0.4 and 2.0.5 is that the algebra C[X] is factorial, where
X = G/S. H then acts regularly on G/S by left translation (ie: x · gS = xgS, for g ∈ G,
x ∈ H). And therefore, we are in a position to apply Theorem 2.0.1, as in the next section.
                                   3. Representation Theory.
 This section begins by recalling some basic notation, terminology and results of Lie theory.
We refer the reader to [Bou89], [Bou02], [FH91], [GW98], and [Kna02] for this material.
3.1. Notions from Lie theory. Let G denote a semisimple, connected, complex algebraic
group. We will assume that G is simply connected. T will denote a maximal algebraic torus
in G. Let r = dim T . Let B be a Borel subgroup containing T . The unipotent radical, U,
of B is a maximal unipotent subgroup of G such that B = T · U. Let g, h, b, n+ denote
the Lie algebras of G, T , B, and U respectively. Let W := NG (T )/T denote the Weyl group
corresponding to G and T .
   The Borel subalgebra, b, contains the Cartan subalgebra, h and is a semidirect sum4
b = h D n+ .
   The weights of g are the linear functionals ξ ∈ h∗ . For α ∈ h∗ , set:
                             gα = {X ∈ g | [H, X] = α(H)X ∀H ∈ h}.
For 0 6= α ∈ h∗ , we say that α is a root if gα 6= (0). For such α, we have dim gα = 1. Let Φ
denote the set of roots. We then have the decomposition:
                                                  X
                                        g=h⊕          gα .
                                                         α∈Φ
                                                                          P
The choice of B defines a decomposition Φ = Φ+ ∪ −Φ+ so that n+ = α∈Φ+ gα . We refer to
                                                                             P
Φ+ (resp. Φ− := −Φ+ ) as the positive (resp. negative) roots. Set: n− = α∈Φ+ g−α . Let B
denote the (opposite) Borel subgroup of G with Lie algebra h ⊕ n− . There is a unique choice
of simple roots Π = {α1 , · · · , αr } contained in Φ+ , such that each α ∈ Φ+ can be expressed
a non-negative integer sum of simple roots. Π is a vector space basis for h∗ . Given ξ, η ∈ h∗
  4The   signs D and B stand for semidirect sum of Lie algebras. If g = g1 D g2 (or g = g2 B g1 ) then g1 is
an ideal in g and g/g1 ∼
                       = g2 .
                                                     3
we write ξ  η if η − ξ is a non-negative integer combination of simple (equiv. positive)
roots.  is the dominance order on h∗ .
   For each positive root α, we may choose a triple: Xα ∈ gα , X−α ∈ g−α and Hα ∈ h,
such that Hα = [Xα , X−α ] and α(Hα ) = 2. Span {Xα , X−α , Hα } is then a three dimensional
simple (TDS) subalgebra of g, and is isomorphic to sl2 .
   The adjoint representation, ad : g → End(g) allows us to define the Killing form, (X, Y ) =
Trace(ad X ad Y ) (X, Y ∈ g). The semisimplicity of g is equivalent to the non-degeneracy of
the Killing form. By restriction, the form defines a non-degenerate form on h, also denoted
(, ). Using this form we may define ι : h → h∗ by ι(X)(−) = (X, −) (X ∈ h), which allows
                                                                                 2α
us to identify h with h∗ . Under this identification, we have ι(Hα ) = (α,α)        =: α∨ .
   By definition, the Weyl group, W acts on T . By differentiating this action we obtain an
action on h, which is invariant under (, ). Via ι, we obtain an action of W on h∗ . In light
of this, we view W as a subgroup of the orthogonal group on h∗ . W preserves Φ. For each
α ∈ Φ, set sα (ξ) = ξ − (ξ, α∨)α (for ξ ∈ h∗ ) to be the reflection through the hyperplane
defined by α∨. We have sα ∈ W . For αi ∈ Π, let si := sαi , be the simple reflection
defined by αi . W is generated by the simple reflections. For w ∈ W , let w = si1 si2 · siℓ
be a reduced expression (ie: an expression for w with shortest length). The number ℓ is
independent of the choice of reduced expression. We call ℓ =: ℓ(w) the length of w. Note
that ℓ(w) = |w(Φ+ ) ∩ Φ− |. There is a unique longest element of W , denoted w0 of length
|Φ+ |.
   The fundamental weights, {ω1 , · · · , ωr } are defined as (ωi , αj∨) = δi,j . We fix the ordering of
the fundamental weights to correspond
                                  P        with the
                                                  P usual numbering of the nodes in the Dynkin
diagram as in [Bou02]. Set ρ = 12 α∈Φ+ α = ri=1 ωi . A weight ξ ∈ h∗ is said to          Pbe  dominant
                                                                     ∗      ∨               r
if (λ, α) ≥ 0 for all α ∈ Π. The weight lattice P (g) = {ξ ∈ h |(ξ, α ) ∈ Z} = i=1 Zωi . We
define the dominant integral weights to be those ξ ∈ P (g) such that (ξ, α) ≥ 0 for all α ∈ Π.
The set of dominant integral weights, P+ (g), parameterizes the irreducible
                                                                         P           finite dimensional
representations of g (or equivalently, of G). We have 5 P+ (g) = ri=1 Nωi .
3.2. Notions from representation theory. U(g) denotes the universal enveloping algebra
of g. The category of Lie algebra representations of g is equivalent to the category of U(g)–
      L A g-representation (equiv. U(g)–module), M, is said to be a weight module if
modules.
M=      M(ξ), where:
                                 M(ξ) = {v ∈ M|Hv = ξ(H)v ∀H ∈ h} .
  Among weight modules are the modules admitting a highest weight vector. That is to say,
a unique (up to scalar multiple) vector, v0 ∈ M such that:
                      +
    (1) Cv0 = M n := {v ∈ M|n+ v = 0},
    (2) M(λ) = Cv0 for some λ ∈ h∗ , and
    (3) U(n− )v0 = M.
Such a module is said to be a highest weight module (equiv highest weight representation).
λ is the highest weight of M. Given ξ ∈ h∗ with M(ξ) 6= (0) we have ξ  λ.
   For λ ∈ h∗ , we let Cλ be the 1-dimensional representation of h defined by λ, then extended
trivially to define a representation of b by requiring n+ · Cλ = (0). Let N(λ) := U(g) ⊗U (b) Cλ
denote the Verma module defined by λ. Let L(λ) denote the irreducible quotient of N(λ).
  5As   usual, N = {0, 1, 2, · · · } (the non-negative integers).
                                                           4
For λ, µ ∈ h∗ , L(λ) ∼
                     = L(µ) iff λ = µ. L(λ) (and N(λ)) are highest weight representations.
Any irreducible highest weight representation is equivalent to L(λ) for a unique λ ∈ h∗ . The
theorem of the highest weight asserts that dim L(λ) < ∞ iff λ ∈ P+ (g).
  Each µ ∈ P (g), corresponds to a linear character of T , denoted eµ . For λ ∈ P+ (g), the
character of L(λ) defines a complex valued regular function on T . This character may be
expressed as in the following:
Theorem 3.2.1 (Weyl).
                                              P             ℓ(w) w(λ+ρ)−ρ
                                                 w∈W (−1)     e
                                 ch L(λ) =        Q             −α )
                                                                            .
                                                     α∈Φ+ (1 − e

   It becomes necessary for us to refer to representations of both the group G and the Lie
algebra of G (always denoted g). By our assumptions on G (in conditions (∗)), we have that
the every finite dimensional complex representation of g integrates to a regular representation
of G. The differential of this group representation recovers the original representation of the
Lie algebra. We will implicitly use this correspondence.
   For our purposes, of particular importance is the decomposition of the regular 6 represen-
tation of G. That is,
Theorem 3.2.2. For f ∈ C[G], (g, h) ∈ G × G define: (g, h) · f (x) = f (g −1xh) (x ∈ G).
Under this action we have the classical Peter-Weyl decomposition:
                                         M
                               C[G] ∼=        L(λ)∗ ⊗
                                                    b L(λ),                         (3.1)
                                              λ∈P+ (g)

as a representation of G × G. Here the superscript ∗ denotes the dual representation. Note
that L(λ)∗ is an irreducible highest weight representation of highest weight −w0 (λ).
  We introduce the following notation:
Definition 3.2.3. Let σ : G → GL(V ) (resp. τ : H → GL(W )) be a representation of a
group G (resp. H). If H ⊆ G we may regard (σ, V ) as a representation of H by restriction.
We set:
                             [V, W ] := dim HomH (V, W ).
If either V or W is infinite dimensional HomH (V, W ) may be infinite dimensional. In this case
[V, W ] should be regarded as an infinite cardinal. (We will not encounter this situation in
what is to follow.) If V is completely reducible as an H-representation, and W is irreducible,
[V, W ] is the multiplicity of W in V (By Schur’s lemma).
   Note: We will use the same (analogous) notation of the category of Lie algebra represen-
tation.
3.3. On the χ(T )-gradation of C[U\G]. We apply a philosophy taught to us by R. Howe.
As before, U is a maximal unipotent subgroup of G, T a maximal torus (normalizing U).
  As in Theorem 3.2.2, U × G ⊆ G × G acts on C[G]. We have C[G]U ∼      = C[U\G]. As
                                                                    −1
T normalizes U we have an action of T on C[U\G] via t · f (x) = f (t x) for t ∈ T and
  6We   use the word “regular” in two senses, the other being in the context of algebraic geometry.
                                                      5
x ∈ U\G. We call this action the left action, since the multiplication is on the left. By
Theorem 3.2.2, we have:
                                      M
                          C[U\G] =          (L(λ)∗ )U ⊗ L(λ).                         (3.2)
                                          λ∈P+ (g)

A consequence of the theorem of the highest weight is that dim (L(λ)∗ )U = 1. We let,
χ(T ) ∼
      = Zr , denotethe character group of T . Each λ ∈ P+ (g) defines a	character, eλ , of T .
Set: C[U\G]λ := f ∈ C[U\G] | f (t−1 x) = eλ (t)f (x) ∀x ∈ U\G, t ∈ T . G then acts (by
right multiplication) on C[U\G], and under this action we have: C[U\G]λ ∼  = L(λ). We then
obtain a χ(T )-gradation of the algebra. That is to say, C[U\G]ξ · C[U\G]η ⊆ C[U\G]ξ+η .
We exploit this phenomenon to obtain:
Proposition 3.3.1. Let W be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of a reductive
subgroup, H, of G. Given λ, µ ∈ P+ (g), If L(µ)H 6= (0) and [W, L(λ)] 6= 0 then [W, L(λ +
µ)] 6= 0.
Remark 3.3.2. In Proposition 3.3.1, the G-representations L(λ) and L(λ + µ) are regarded
as H-representations by restriction.
Proof of Proposition 3.3.1. Let f ∈ C[U\G]H  ∼       H                 ∼
                                           µ = L(µ) and W̃ ⊆ C[U\G]λ = L(λ) such that
W ∼= W̃ as a representation of H. Then f · W ⊆ C[U\G]λ+µ . Under the (right) action of H
we have, f · W̃ ∼
                = W . Therefore, [W, C[U\G]λ+µ ] 6= 0.                                 
3.4. The maximal parabolic subgroups of G. A connected algebraic subgroup, P , of
G containing a Borel subgroup is said to be parabolic. There exists an inclusion preserving
one-to-one correspondence between parabolic subgroups and subsets of Π. We will recall the
basic set-up.                                                                     P
  Let p = Lie(P ) denote the Lie algebra of a parabolic subgroup P . Then p = h ⊕ α∈Γ gα ,
where Γ := Φ+ ∪ {α ∈ Φ | α ∈ Span(Π′ )} for a unique Π′ ⊆ Π. Set:
                       X                   X                      X
               l=h⊕          gα , u+ =            gα , and u− =         g−α .
                       α∈Γ∩−Γ              α∈Γ, α6∈−Γ              α∈Γ, α6∈−Γ

Then we have, p = l ⊕ u and g = u ⊕ p. The subalgebra l is the Levi factor of p, while u+
                         +            −

is the nilpotent radical of p. l is reductive and hence l = lss ⊕ z(l), where z(l) and lss denote
the center and semisimple part of l respectively.
   The following result is a slight modification of Exercise 12.2.4 in [GW98] (p. 532).
Proposition 3.4.1. For 0 6= λ ∈ P+ (g), let vλ be a highest weight vector in L(λ).
Let X = G · vλ ⊆ L(λ) denote the orbit of vλ and let Gvλ = {g ∈ G|g · vλ = vλ } denote the
corresponding isotropy group. Then, X is a quasi-affine variety stable under the action of C×
on L(λ) defined
            L∞ by scalar   multiplication. This C× -action defines a graded algebra structure
                       (d)
on C[X] = d=0 C[X] .
  The action of G on C[X], defined by g · f (x) = f (g −1 · x) (for g ∈ G and x ∈ X) commutes
with the C× -action and therefore each graded component of C[X] is a representation of G.
Furthermore, we have:
                                    C[X](n) ∼
                                            = L(−nw0 (λ))
for all n ∈ N.
                                                 6
Proof. Set V = L(λ), and let vλ be a highest weight vector in V . Let PV = {[v]|v ∈ V }
denote the complex projective space on V . G then acts on PV by g · [v] = [g · v] for g ∈ G
and v ∈ V . The isotropy group of [vλ ] contains the Borel subgroup, B and therefore is a
parabolic subgroup, PS⊆ G. G/P is projective so, G · [vλ ] ⊂ PV is closed. This means that
the affine cone, A := g∈G [g · vλ ] ⊂ V is closed. Let a ∈ A. Then, a = z(g · vλ ) for some
z ∈ C and g ∈ G. The action of G on V is linear so, a = g · zvλ . By the assumption that
λ 6= 0, T acts on Cvλ by a non-trivial linear character. All non-trivial linear characters of
tori are surjective (this is because the image of a (connected) algebraic group homomorphism
is closed and connected). Therefore, if z 6= 0, then zvλ = t · vλ for some t ∈ T . This fact
implies7 that either a ∈ X or a = 0. And so, X = X ∪ {0} = A. X is therefore quasi-affine
since X = A − {0} (0 6∈ X since λ 6= 0). We have also shown that X is stable under scalar
multiplication by a non-zero complex number.
   Let vλ∗ ∈ L(λ)∗ be a highest weight vector. Upon restriction vλ∗ defines a regular function
on X in C[X](1) , which is a highest weight vector for the left action of G on C[X]. Then,
(vλ∗ )n ∈ C[X](n) . (vλ∗ )n is a highest weight vector, hence, [C[X](n) , L(nλ)∗ ] 6= 0. That is to
say, we have an injective G-equivariant map, ψ : L(nλ)∗ ֒→ C[X](n) . It remains to show that
ψ is an isomorphism.
   Since X is quasi-affine, C[X] ∼    = C[G]Gvλ . By restriction of the regular representation,
G × Gvλ acts on C[G]. And so by, Theorem 3.2.2:
                                             M
                                    C[X] ∼
                                         =        L(ξ)∗ ⊗ L(ξ)Gvλ
                                             ξ∈P+ (g)

Set Lξ := L(ξ)Gvλ . U ⊆ Gvλ since vλ is a highest weight vector. Therefore, Lξ ⊆ L(ξ)U and
dim Lξ ≤ 1. And so, C[X] is multiplicity free as a representation of G (under the action of
left multiplication).8 We will show that the only possible ξ for which dim Lξ > 0 are the
non-negative integer multiples of λ. By the fact that C[X] is multiplicity free we will see
that ψ must be an isomorphism.
   If Lξ 6= (0) then Lξ = L(ξ)U since they are both 1-dimensional. Assume that Lξ 6= (0).
Choose, 0 6= vξ ∈ Lξ . Note that vξ is a highest weight vector. T acts on Cvξ by t·vξ = eξ (t)vξ
for all t ∈ T . Set Tξ := T ∩ Gvλ and hλ := Lie(Tλ ) = {H ∈ h | λ(H) = 0}.
   H ∈ hλ implies both H · vξ = 0 and H · vξ = ξ(H)vξ . Hence we have ξ(H) = 0 when
H ∈ hλ . This statement is equivalent to λ and ξ being linearly dependent. Furthermore, we
have n1 ξ = n2 λ for n1 , n2 ∈ N since ξ and λ are both dominant integral weights.
   If dim Lξ = 1 then [C[X](n) , L(ξ)∗] 6= 0 for some n ∈ N. This forces [C[X](nn1 ) , L(n1 ξ)∗ ] 6= 0
and therefore, [C[X](nn1 ) , L(n2 λ)∗ ] 6= 0. As before, [C[X](n2 ) , L(n2 λ)∗ ] 6= 0. Using the fact
that C[X] is multiplicity free, we have nn1 = n2 . And so, ξ = nλ.                                  
Remark. The closure of the variety X in Proposition 3.4.1 is called the highest weight variety
in [VP72] (see [GW98]).
  If Π′ = Π − {α} for some simple root α, then the corresponding parabolic subgroup is
maximal (among proper parabolic subgroups). Consequently, the maximal parabolic sub-
groups of G may be parameterized by the nodes of the Dynkin diagram, equivalently, by
  7Ifa 6= 0, a = g · (t · vλ ) = (gt) · vλ ∈ X.
  8Alternatively, B has a dense orbit in X (since BU is dense in G (ie: the big cell)). A dense orbit under
a Borel subgroup is equivalent to having a multiplicity free coordinate ring.

fundamental weights of G. Set: λ = −w0 (ωk ). Let vk ∈ L(λ)U be a highest weight vector.
Define:
                        Xg(k) := G · vk ⊆ L(λ)     (1 ≤ k ≤ r),
the orbit of vk under the action of G. (When there is no chance of confusion, we write X (k)
      (k)
for Xg .)
   We have seen that this orbit has the structure of a quasi-affine variety. It is easy to
see that the isotropy group, S (k) of vk is of the form S (k) = [Pk , Pk ], where Pk denotes
a maximal parabolic subgroup of G.9 Let p := Lie(Pk ) and p = l ⊕ u+ denote the Levi
decomposition. We have p = l + n+ and n+ = [b, b] ⊂ [p, p] and lss = [l, l] ⊆ [p, p].
Therefore, [p, p] = lss + n+ = lss ⊕ u+ . (Note that all that is lost is z(l).) We say that Pk is
the parabolic subgroup corresponding to the fundamental weight ωk .
   We have dim X (k) = dim g/[p, p] and 2 dim g/[p, p] = dim(g/lss )+1 (Note that dim z(l) = 1
since Pk is maximal.) In light of these facts, we see that the dimension of X (k) may be read
off of the Dynkin diagram. The dimension is important for the proof of Corollary 3.5.2.
In Section 6, we explicitly compute dim g/lss for the exceptional Lie algebras and low rank
classical Lie algebras.
Corollary 3.4.2. For X = X (k) where 1 ≤ k ≤ r we have:
                                         M∞
                                 C[X] =∼     L(nωk )                                                        (3.3)

as a representation of G.
Proof. The result is immediate from Proposition 3.4.1.                                                         
3.5. A consequence of Theorem 2.0.1.
The goal of Section 2 was to prove Theorem 2.0.1. We now apply this theorem to obtain the
following:
Proposition 3.5.1. Assume G and H satisfy conditions (∗), and we take S = S (k) , for
some 1 ≤ k ≤ r. Set: X := X (k) .
                          dim H < dim X =⇒ C[X]H ∼ 6= C.
Proof. If O is a generic H-orbit in X then dim O ≤ dim H < dim X. By Theorems 2.0.4 and
2.0.5, the algebra C[X] is factorial, because C[X] = C[G]S . The result follows from Theorem
2.0.1.                                                                                     
  We now provide a representation theoretic interpretation of this proposition as it relates
to sl2 ..
3.5.1. The sl2 -case. Consider a triple (G, S, H) such that the following conditions (∗∗) hold:
Conditions (∗∗).
  (1) (G, S, H) satisfy conditions (∗), and:
  (2) g has no simple factor of Lie type A1.
  (3) S = S (k) , where 1 ≤ k ≤ r. Set: X := X (k) (:= G/S).
  9This  fact in not true for the orbit of an arbitrary dominant integral weight. In general, [p, p] 6= Lie(Gvλ ),
for any parabolic subalgebra p.
                                                        8
   (4) sl2 ∼
           = Lie(H) =: k ⊆ g
Corollary 3.5.2. Assume conditions (∗∗), and that g has no simple factor of Lie type A2.
Then, C[X]H ∼
            6= C.
Proof. The statement can be reduced to the case where g is simple. For G simple and not of
type A1 or A2, we appeal to the classification of maximal parabolic subgroups (see the tables
in Section 6) to deduce that dim X > 3. as H ∼   = SL2 (C) (locally). Hence, dim H < dim X.
We are then within the hypothesis of Proposition 3.5.1.                                    
   We next address the case when g does have a simple factor of Lie type A2. For this material
we need to analyze the set of sl2 -subalgebras of g = sl3 , up to a Lie algebra automorphism.
For general results on the subalgebras of g we refer the reader to [Dyn52a] and [Dyn52b].
   In the case of g = sl3 there are two such sl2 subalgebras. One being the root sl2 -subalgebra
corresponding to any one of the three positive roots of g. The other is the famous principal
sl2 -subalgebra.
   A principal sl2 -subalgebra ([Dyn52b], [Kos59]) of g is a subalgebra k ⊆ g such that k ∼= sl 2
and contains a regular nilpotent element. These subalgebras are conjugate, so we sometimes
speak of “the” principal sl2 -subalgebra. There is a beautiful connection between the principal
sl2 -subalgebra and the cohomology of G, (see [Kos59]). There is a nice discussion of this
theory in [CM93].
Lemma 3.5.3. Assume conditions (∗∗). Let G and H be such that g ∼         = sl3 , and Lie(H) is
a principal sl2 -subalgebra of g. Then, dim C[X] > 0, for X = X or X = X (2) .
                                                   H                 (1)


Proof. A principal sl2 -subgroup in sl3 is embedded as a symmetric subalgebra. More pre-
cisely, let H := SO3 (C) ⊆ G, then Lie(H) is a principal sl2 -subalgebra of sl3 .
   In general, if G = SLn (C) and K = SOn (C) with H embedded in G in the standard way,
then the pair (G, H) is symmetric (ie: H is the fixed point set of a regular involution on G).
As before, let r denote the rank of G. In order the prove the lemma (for r = 2), it suffices
to observe that by the Cartan-Helgason theorem (see [GW98], Chapter 11) we have:
                                                    P
                                      K      1, λ ∈ ri=1 2Nωi ;
                              dim L(λ) =
                                             0, Otherwise.
                                                                                            
Lemma 3.5.4. Assume conditions (∗∗). Let G and H be such that g ∼        = sl3 , and Lie(H) is
a root sl2 -subalgebra of g. Then, dim C[X]H > 0, for X = X (1) or X = X (2) .
Proof. It is the case that L(ω1 ) and L(ω2 ) both have H-invariants, as they are equivalent to
the standard representation of G and its dual respectively.                                 
  Summarizing we obtain:
Proposition 3.5.5. Under assumptions (∗∗), dim C[X]H > 0.
Proof. The statement reduces to the case where g is simple, because a maximal parabolic
subalgebra of g must contain all but one simple factor of g. Therefore, assume that g is
                                         6= sl3 , apply Corollary 3.5.2. If g ∼
simple without loss of generality. For g ∼                                    = sl3 , then Lie(H)
is embedded as either a root sl2 -subalgebra, or as a principal sl2 -subalgebra. Apply Lemmas
3.5.4 and 3.5.3 to the respective cases.                                                        

  The following will be of fundamental importance in Section 4.
Definition 3.5.6. For G and H as in conditions (∗), we consider the following set of positive
integers 10:                        n                              o
                     M(G, H, j) := n ∈ Z+ | dim [L(nωj )]H 6= (0)
where j is a positive integer with 1 ≤ j ≤ r. Set:
                                  
                                     min M(G, H, j), if M(G, H, j) 6= ∅;
                   m(G, H, j) :=
                                           0,        if M(G, H, j) = ∅.
We will also write m(g, k, j) (resp. M(g, k, j)) where (as before) k = Lie(H) and g = Lie(G).
Proposition 3.5.7. For G and H as in conditions (∗∗),
                                   m(G, H, k) > 0 for all, 1 ≤ k ≤ r.
Proof. Apply Corollary 3.4.2 and Proposition 3.5.5.                                                       
  Proposition 3.5.1 applies to a much more general situation than k ∼
                                                                    = sl2 .
3.5.2. The semisimple case. As it turns out, what we have done for the sl2 -subalgebras
can be done for any semisimple subalgebra.
Proposition 3.5.8. If G and H are as in condition (∗), then for each 1 ≤ k ≤ r,
                               dim H < dim X (k) =⇒ m(G, H, k) > 0.
Proof. Apply Proposition 3.5.1 and Corollary 3.4.2.                                                       
  In order to effectively apply Proposition 3.5.8 we will want to guarantee that dim H <
dim X (k) for all 1 ≤ k ≤ r. This will happen if all simple factors of g have sufficiently high
rank. This idea motivates the following definition. Consider a group G (as in condition (∗))
and define:
                                   e(g) := min dim Xg(k)
                                                    1≤k≤r

                      4. A Proof of a theorem in Penkov-Zuckerman
  This section is devoted to the proof of the following theorem:
Theorem 4.0.10. Let k be an sl2 -subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra g, none of whose
simple factors is of type A1. Then there exists a positive integer b(k, g), such that for every
irreducible finite dimensional g-module V , there exists an injection of k-modules W → V ,
where W is an irreducible k-module of dimension less than b(k, g).
Proof. We assume all of the structure of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 (ie: h, Φ, W , etc.). Consider a
fixed k and g. For k ∈ N, let V (k) denote the irreducible, finite dimensional representation of k
of dimension k+1. Each irreducible representation of g may be regarded as a k representation
by restriction. As before, for λ ∈ P+ (g), we let [L(λ), V (k)] denote the multiplicity of V (k)
in L(λ). Set:
                      g0 (λ) := min{dim V (k)|k ∈ N and [L(λ), V (k)] 6= 0}.
For each fundamental weight ωi (1 ≤ i ≤ r), let mi := m(g, k, i) (as in   PDefinition 3.5.6). By
Proposition 3.5.7, mi 6= 0 for all i. Set δi := mi ωi , and define C0 := { ri=1 ai ωi |0 ≤ ai < ni }.
We set:
                                b(k, g) := max {g0 (λ)|λ ∈ C0 } + 1.
             r
                            Pr
For q ∈ N , let Cq := ( i=1 qi δi ) + C0 . By the division algorithm, the collection of sets,
{Cq | q ∈ Nr } partitions P+ (g). We claim that for every q ∈ Nr , max{g0 (λ)|λ ∈ Cq } < b(k, g).
   The result follows from this claim. Indeed, let V = L(λ), for λ ∈ P+ (g). There exists (a
unique) q ∈ Nr such that λ ∈ Cq . Let W be the irreducible k-representation of dimension
g0 (λ). By definition of g0 , there exists an injection of W into L(λ). By the claim, dim W =
g0 (λ) < b(k, g). The result follows.
   We now will establish the claimPby applying Proposition 3.3.1.
   Let q ∈ Nr and λ′ ∈ Cq . µ = ri=1 qi δi . Set: λ := λ′ − µ. By definition of Cq , we have
λ ∈ C0 , and so g0 (λ) < b(k, g). This means that there exists an irreducible k-representation,
W , such that dim W < b(k, g) and [W, L(λ)] 6= 0. By definition, λ′ = λ + µ. Clearly,
12
    L(µ)k 6= (0). Applying Proposition 3.3.1 we see that [W, L(λ′ )] 6= 0. This means that
g0 (λ′ ) ≤ b(k, g). The claim follows.                                                             
Theorem 4.0.11. Let k be a semisimple subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra g, none of
whose simple factors is in the set E(k). Then there exists a positive integer b(k, g), such that
for every irreducible finite dimensional g-module V , there exists an injection of k-modules
W → V , where W is an irreducible k-module of dimension less than b(k, g).
Proof. The proof is essentially the same as the proof of Theorem 4.0.10. The only changes
are a substitution of Proposition 3.5.8 for Proposition 3.5.7, and we index irreducible repre-
sentation of k by P+ (k) rather than N. We leave it to the reader to fill in the details.   
   The above theorems begs us to compute the smallest value of b(k, g). This is the subject
of the Section 5 for the case when g is the exceptional Lie algebra G2 and k is a principal
sl2 -subalgebra of g. Other examples will follow in future work.
   We remark that the number b(k, g) clearly depends on k (as the notation suggests). Of
course, there are only finitely many sl2 -subalgebras in g, up to automorphism of g. We can
therefore, consider the maximum value of b(k, g) as k ranges over this finite set. We will
  12As   a special case of Proposition 3.3.1, we see that since L(δi )k 6= (0) for all i, we have L(µ)k 6= (0).
                                                        11
call this number b(g). With this in mind, one might attempt to estimate b(g) for a given
semisimple Lie algebra g.
  On the other hand, there is a sense that one could fix k to be (say) a principal sl2 -subalgebra
in some g. We could then consider the question of whether b(k, g) is bounded as g varies
(among semisimple Lie algebras with no simple A1 factor).
  Even more impressive would be allowing both g and k to vary. It is certainly not clear that
a bound would even exists for b(k, g). If it did, we would be interested in an estimate.

                                       5. Example: G2
  In this section we consider an example which illustrates the result of Section 4.
  Let G be a connected, simply connected, complex algebraic group with g ∼     = G2 . Let K be
a connected principal SL2 -subgroup of G. As before, we set k = Lie(K).
  We order the fundamental weights of g so that L(ω1 ) = 7 and dim L(ω2 ) = 14. For the
rest of this section, we will refer to the representation L(aω1 + bω2 ) (for a, b ∈ N) as [a, b].

                Table 1.   dim[i, j]K where   K is a principle   SL2 -subgroup in G2 .


   Table 1 was generated by an implementation of the Weyl character formula (see Theorem
3.2.1) for the group G2 using the computer algebra system MAPLEr . The characters were
restricted to a maximal torus in K, thus allowing us to find the character of [i, j] as a rep-
resentation of SL2 (C). This character was used to compute the dimension of the invariants
for K.
                                                 12
   Using the same implementation we can compute the values of g0 (λ) for the pair (k, g). We
display these data in the table below for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 19.

              Table   2.   Value of   g0 (iω1 + jω2 ) for a principal SL2 -subgroup in            G2 .


   Of particular interest is the 7 in row 1 column 0. The irreducible G2 -representation [1, 0] is
irreducible when restricted to a principal sl2 subalgebra. And therefore, g0 (ω1 ) = dim[1, 0] =
7. Note that most entries in Table 2 are 1. Following the proof in Section 4 we see that
b(k, g) = 7 + 1 = 8. That is, every finite dimensional representation of G2 contains an
irreducible k-representation of dimension less than 8.
   Even more interesting is the fact that Table 2 suggests that there are only 26 ordered pairs
(a, b) such that g0 (aω1 + bω2 ) > 1. This is indeed the case:
Theorem 5.0.12. For all a, b ∈ N, [a, b]K 6= (0) except for the following list of 26 exceptions:
                      [0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 5], [0, 7], [0, 9], [0, 11], [0, 13], [1, 0], [1, 1],
                       [1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 3], [2, 5], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2],
                         [4, 1], [5, 0], [6, 1], [7, 0], [9, 0], [11, 0], [13, 0], [17, 0].
Proof. By inspection of Table 1 (or Table 2), it suffices to show that for all a, b ∈ N such that
a > 24 or b > 24 we have dim[a, b]K > 0. Let µ1 , · · · , µ6 denote the highest weights of the
representations [0, 2], [0, 17], [4, 0], [15, 0], [5, 1], and [1, 3]. From the table we see that each of
                                                             P
these representations has a K-invariant. Let Z = 6i=1 Nµi ⊂ P+ (g). By Proposition 3.3.1,
(for W trivial), each element of Z has a K-invariant. It is easy to see that E = P+ (g)−Z is a
finite set. In fact, computer calculations show that E consists of the following 194 elements:

   If one checks, we see that each of these has an invariant except for the 26 exceptional
values in the statement of the theorem.
   Unfortunately, our tables (in this paper) are not big enough to see all of these weights.
                                                                                              P
For this reason, we can alternately consider the set Z ′ = 9i=1 Nµ′i , where µ′1 , · · · , µ′9 are the
highest weights of the representations [0, 2], [0, 17], [4, 0], [6, 0], [15, 0], [5, 1], [1, 3], [7, 1], and
[1, 6]. Again, each of these has a K-invariant (from the tables) and therefore by Proposition
3.3.1, each element of Z ′ has a K-invariant. Set E ′ = P+ (g) − Z ′ . E ′ has 73 elements. They
are: [0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 5], [0, 7], [0, 9], [0, 11], [0, 13], [0, 15], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2,
7], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7], [3, 8], [3, 10], [4, 1], [4, 3], [4, 5], [4, 7], [4, 9], [4, 11], [4, 13], [5, 0], [5, 2],
[5, 4], [6, 1], [6, 3], [6, 5], [7, 0], [7, 2], [7, 4], [8, 1], [8, 3], [8, 5], [9, 0], [9, 2], [9, 4], [10, 1], [10, 3], [10, 5], [11, 0], [11, 2], [11, 4],
[12, 1], [12, 3], [12, 5], [13, 0], [13, 2], [13, 4], [14, 1], [14, 3], [14, 5], [16, 1], [17, 0], [17, 2], [17, 4], [18, 1], [18, 3], [18, 5].
This time, each of these representations is on our tables. And so, the reader may (and
should) check that, apart from the 26 exceptional values in the statement of the theorem,
all of these have a positive dimension of K-invariants.                                

                               6. Tables for maximal parabolic subalgebras.
     In the proof of Corollary 3.5.2 we needed to see that if g was a simple Lie algebra not
of type A2, then dim(g/[p, p]) > 3 for a maximal parabolic subalgebra p. If p = l ⊕ u+ ,
[l, l] = lss then we can deduce that this inequality is equivalent to dim(g/lss ) > 5 (using the
formula dim(g/[p, p]) = 12 (dim g/lss + 1). It is possible to exhaust over all possible cases to
establish this fact. The exceptional cases are in the following table:

  For the classical cases, the situation reduces to the examination of several families of
parabolic subalgebras. In each family, we can determine the dimension of g/lss for any of
parabolic p = l ⊕ u+ , from the formulas:
                                                dim An    =      (n + 1)2 − 1
                                                dim Bn    =      n(2n + 1)
                                                dim Cn    =      n(2n + 1)
                                                dim Dn    =      n(2n − 1)
For example, if g = An (n ≥ 2) and lss = Ap ⊕ Aq for p + q = n − 1 (set dim A0 := 0) we have
dim(g/lss ) = dim An − dim Ap − dim Aq = n2 − p2 − q 2 + 2n + 2p + 2q − 2. Upon examination
of the possible values of this polynomial over the parameter space we see that the smallest
value is 5. This case occurs only for n = 2. All other values of p and q give rise to larger
values. In fact, for g classical and not of type A the dimension is also greater than 5. The
low rank cases are summarized in the following tables:
