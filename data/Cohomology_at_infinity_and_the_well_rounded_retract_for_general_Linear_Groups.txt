                                                                                       Introduction
                                             (0.1). Let G be a reductive algebraic group defined over Q, and let Γ be an arithmetic
                                             subgroup of G(Q). Let X be the symmetric space for G(R), and assume X is contractible.
                                             Then the cohomology (mod torsion) of the space X/Γ is the same as the cohomology of Γ.
                                             In turn, X/Γ will have the same cohomology as W/Γ, if W is a “spine” in X. This means
                                             that W (if it exists) is a deformation retract of X by a Γ-equivariant deformation retraction,
                                             that W/Γ is compact, and that dim W equals the virtual cohomological dimension (vcd)
                                             of Γ. Then W can be given the structure of a cell complex on which Γ acts cellularly, and
                                             the cohomology of W/Γ can be found combinatorially.
                                                Spines have been found for many groups G (see (2.6) below, and [A1] [M-M0] [M-
                                             M1]). This paper concerns the case where G is the restriction of scalars of a general linear
                                             group over a number field k with ring of integers O. This means G(Q) = GLn (k). We
                                             shall take Γ to be a subgroup of finite index in GLn (O), or more generally in GL(P),
                                             where P is a projective O-module of rank n. In [A3], Ash found a spine W for these
                                             G, calling W the well-rounded retract. (This generalized [Sou2].) The retract has been
                                             used in computations: see [Sou1] [A-G-G] [A-M1] [A-M2] [vG-T]. We remark that k = Q,
                                             Γ ⊆ GLn (Z) for n = 2, 3, 4 still provide our main cases of computational interest. For
                                             imaginary quadratic fields k and n = 2, see [Men] [S-V] [V]. For real quadratic k and
                                             n = 2, see [B].
                                             (0.2). The present paper extends [A3] to deal with the “cusps” of X/Γ, in a way which
                                             we now describe.
                                                Borel and Serre [B-S] introduced a bordification X̄ of X such that X̄/Γ is a compactifi-
                                             cation of X/Γ. The space X̄/Γ has the same homotopy type as X/Γ, and therefore has the
                                             same homotopy type as W/Γ. The boundary of X̄/Γ is a union of finitely many “faces”,
                                             one for each equivalence class mod Γ of parabolic Q-subgroups of G.

    The Borel-Serre boundary gives a geometric approach for distinguishing the cuspidal
cohomology within the whole cohomology of Γ. A cohomology class on X̄/Γ with co-
efficients in C can be viewed, via the de Rham theorem, as coming from a Γ-invariant
automorphic form on G(R). If the class has non-zero restriction to the boundary, it is
certainly not a cusp form. The converse is not completely true, but the difference between
the “interior cohomology” (the span of classes that restrict to zero on the boundary) and
the “cuspidal cohomology” (the span of classes whose associated automorphic forms are
cuspidal) is fairly well understood, thanks to the theory of Eisenstein series. In many
practical examples, like the GL4 (Z) example mentioned below, there is no difference; to
compute the cuspidal cohomology in certain degrees, we simply compute the restriction of
the cohomology to the boundary.
    A related question is the existence of “ghost classes”—those classes which restrict to
zero on each face of the boundary, but do not restrict to zero on the whole boundary.
Harder has given examples of ghost classes [H]; it is of interest to know how widespread
the phenomenon is.
    In specific cases, then, one may need to compute the cohomology of the boundary of
X̄/Γ, the cohomology of individual boundary faces, and the restriction map from H ∗ (X̄/Γ)
to these groups.
    This paper builds a technology for these computations, when G is the general linear
group in (0.1) and W is the well-rounded retract of [A3]. To each Borel-Serre boundary
face in X̄, we associate a closed subcomplex W ′ of W . Let Γ′ be the stabilizer of W ′ in Γ.
We prove that the inclusion W ′ /Γ′ ֒→ W/Γ induces the same map on cohomology as the
inclusion of the corresponding boundary face into X̄/Γ. Our main result, Theorem 9.5, is
that there is a spectral sequence converging to H ∗ (∂ X̄/Γ) whose E1 term is the direct sum
of the cohomology of the various W ′ /Γ′ . There are only finitely many terms in this direct
sum. There is a map of spectral sequences, starting with a natural map from H ∗ (W/Γ)
to the E1 term, that induces the canonical restriction map H ∗ (X̄/Γ) → H ∗ (∂ X̄/Γ) up to
canonical isomorphism. There is a dual statement in homology (10.2). We do not assume
that Γ is torsion-free. We use (co)homology with coefficients in any fixed abelian group.
    We can also find the maps on (co)homology induced by the inclusion of a single boundary
face into X̄/Γ, without any spectral sequences (10.3).
    Each W ′ /Γ′ is a finite cell complex, so its cohomology can be worked out combinatorially.
See (6.3) for an example. We emphasize that each W ′ is a subcomplex of W , so that we
can work with it in terms already available once we have computed W in any given case.
    In a future paper, we will use this method to study the congruence subgroups Γ0 (p) of
prime level p in GL4 (Z). For a range of p, we will compute H 5 (Γ0 (p), C), and will isolate
the subspace of classes that restrict to zero on the boundary. We will compute the Hecke
eigenvalues of these classes, using either the new techniques of Paul Gunnells, or the new
techniques of R. MacPherson and the second author. We will try to determine whether
any of the cusp forms we find are functorial lifts from smaller groups such as Sp4 or O4 .
(0.3). We have long wished to see spelled out in detail the relationship between the well-
rounded retract and the Borel-Serre compactification. The retraction r : X → W carries
any x ∈ X into W by a combination of geodesic actions depending on x—see (4.2). Each

Borel-Serre boundary component e in X̄ has a tubular neighborhood N̄ , homeomorphic to
e × [0, 1)l for appropriate l, where the fibers [0, 1)l are given by the geodesic action. The
retraction r is constant on the interior of each fiber, and carries the interior of N̄ onto the
corresponding cell complex W ′ .
   The main idea of the paper is to extend the retraction r : X → W to a continuous
Γ-equivariant map r̄ : X̄ → W . It is relatively easy to see that the continuous extension
exists and is Γ-equivariant. However, r = r1 really comes from a deformation retraction
rt : X × [0, 1] → X, and it is harder to prove that r̄ comes from a deformation retraction
of X̄ onto W . A simple example will illustrate the problem. The map ft : R × [0, 1] → R
given by (x, t) 7→ (1 − t) · x is a deformation retraction of R onto {0}. The compactification
[−∞, ∞] of R certainly has a deformation retraction onto {0}. But ft does not extend to
the deformation retraction for [−∞, ∞].
   To fix the problem with [−∞, ∞], we can first use any deformation retraction onto
[−x0 , x0 ] for some large x0 , and then use the old ft to retract [−x0 , x0 ] to {0}. We do
something similar to prove r̄ is a deformation retraction. We use Saper’s recent construc-
tion [S] of a “central tile” X0 ⊂ X and a deformation retraction rt,S of X̄ onto X0 . This
X0 is a large codimension-zero subset of X, which we may take arbitrarily close to ∂ X̄
in all directions. We show that composing our rt with Saper’s rt,S gives a deformation
retraction Rt : X̄ × [0, 1] → X̄ with r̄ = R1 .
   By what we have said, r̄ gives a homotopy equivalence between X̄/Γ and W/Γ. We
show it also gives a homotopy equivalence between any Borel-Serre boundary component
ē/Γ′ and the corresponding cell complex W ′ /Γ′ . It is then routine to show that r̄ gives
an isomorphism between a standard spectral sequence for H ∗ (∂ X̄/Γ) and the spectral
sequence described in (0.2). This proves our main theorem.
   The sections of the paper follow this outline. In Sections 1–4 we summarize basic
material on algebraic groups, lattices, the well-rounded retract and retraction, and the
Borel-Serre compactification. None of this material is new, but we must recall it to establish
our notation, and because we emphasize some less familiar aspects of it—marked lattices,
the flag of successive minima, the orthogonal scaling group (which is the geodesic action
from a lattice’s point of view), and the connections between rt and the geodesic action.
Section 5 summarizes our notation. In Section 6 we define the sets WF (called W ′ in this
introduction). In Section 7 we define the tubular neighborhoods N̄F (called N̄ here); this
is the technical heart of the paper, where we explore the connections between the well-
rounded retraction and the geodesic action. Section 8 summarizes the material from [S]
that we need, and contains our results on Rt and r̄. In Section 9, we use r̄ to prove our
main theorem on spectral sequences.
(0.4). The results in this paper could be extended in several ways. First, [A3] defines W
for GLn of any finite dimensional division algebra over Q, not necessarily commutative.
Our results could be generalized to that case, presumably with only technical changes.
Second, our arguments work for SL as well as GL, with minor changes (10.5). See (10.4)
for comments on Γ-equivariant cohomology, and (10.6)–(10.7) for other connections with
reduction theory.
   Parts (1.6), (2.6), and (6.3) present the case k = Q in more detail. We hope they help

guide the reader through the technicalities that involve structure over k versus structure
over Q.

                       Section 1—Background on Algebraic Groups
(1.1). We fix a number field k of degree d over Q, with ring of integers O. Let v run
through the archimedean places of k; the completion kv is either R or C. Let R+ be the
positive real numbers.
(1.2). Fix an integer n > 1. The algebraic group GLn is defined over Q, and hence over k.
Let G be the restriction of scalars of GLn from k down to Q.
   To see this algebraic group concretely, fix a Q-basis of k. Let k1 be any commutative
k-algebra. A point of G with entries in k1 is an n × n matrix with non-zero determinant
                                                      (1)         (d)        (l)
whose (i, j)-th entry is a d-tuple of coordinates (xij , . . . , xij ) with xij ∈ k1 . The d-
tuple gives an element of k ⊗Q k1 with respect to the fixed Q-basis of k. Addition and
multiplication of d-tuples are defined using the corresponding operations in k. We fix such
a realization of G throughout the paper.
(1.3). Let S = k ⊗Q R. TheQreal and complex embeddings of k induce a canonical iso-
morphism of R-algebras S ∼
                         = v kv . Clearly k ֒→ S by the canonical diagonal embedding.
   Set G = G(R)Q = GLn (S). Each entry in a matrix of G breaks up as a product over the
               ∼
v’s, so that G = v GLn (kv ).
(1.4). Let Q T be the following maximal Q-split torus of G: if the fixed basis of k over Q
                                                                    (m)
has 1 as its first element, then Q T is the subgroup where all the xij are zero except for
    (1)                                                                       (1)
xii , i = 1, . . . , n. Write Q T = {diag(a1 , . . . , an )} with ai = xii .
   The split radical Rd G of G is the subgroup of Q T in which all the ai are equal to
each other. Let H be the identity component of Rd G(R). These are the positive real
homotheties: h ∈ H acts by a common positive real scalar on each factor GLn (kv ) of G.
We identify H ∼     = R+ .
(1.5). Let a, b ∈ S n . These break up as a product of vectors av , bv ∈ (kv )n . Write av =
(a1 , . . . , an ) with ai ∈ kv , and write bv similarly. For each v, let h(a1 , . . . , an ), (b1 , . . . , bn )iv =
Pn               kv
  i=1 traceR (ai b̄i ), where the bar denotes P complex conjugation when v is complex and                        the
                                                                                                            n
identity when v is real. Let ha, bi = v hav , bv iv , a positive-definite
                                                                      Q               product     on     S    . Let
Kv be the subgroup of GLn (kv ) preserving h , iv . Let K = v Kv ; this is the largest sub-
group of G preserving h , i, and is a maximal compact subgroup of G. Let kak = ha, ai1/2.
Definition. Let X = (HK)\G.
  In the language of [B-S], X is a homogeneous space for G of type S–Q. It is a symmetric
Riemannian space for the Lie group H\G.

(1.6). Example of GLn (Z). Let k = Q. Then G = GLn (R), the group of n × n invertible
matrices with real entries. The group Q T consists of the diagonal matrices, and H =
{diag(h, . . . , h) | h > 0}. The space X is the symmetric space consisting of the real n × n
symmetric positive-definite matrices mod homotheties. When n = 2, X is isomorphic to
the upper half-plane (see (2.6)).

           Section 2—Marked Lattices. The Well-Rounded Retract
   We recall the definition and basic properties of the well-rounded retract for GLn . Except
for the emphasis on marked lattices, the material comes from [A3]; we specialize this to
the number field case, and omit the proofs. For the GLn (Z) case, see (2.6).
(2.1). The space S n of column vectors is an R-vector space. S (and hence k ⊂ S) acts on
it by coordinate-wise multiplication, and G = GLn (S) acts on it on the left. These module
structures commute with each other. If A is a subset of S n , the S-module it spans in S n
is denoted S · A.
(2.2). A Z-lattice in a vector space V over Q is a finitely generated subgroup of V which
contains a Q-basis of V . A Z-lattice in a vector space over R is a finitely generated subgroup
which contains an R-basis that is also a Z-basis.
   Fix once and for all a Z-lattice L0 in k n . Let O0 be the subset of k which stabilizes L0 .
Then O0 is an order in k. Let Γ0 be the arithmetic group consisting of the γ ∈ G such
that γ · L0 = L0 . Let Γ be an arithmetic subgroup of finite index in Γ0 .
   We shall identify lattices that differ only by a homothety, namely L and hL for h ∈ H.
Let Y be the set of all Z-lattices in S n that are stable under O0 and are isomorphic to
L0 as O0 -module. Then we may identify Y with H\G/Γ0 , where for g ∈ G the lattice
L = gL0 corresponds to the coset gΓ0 . Give Y the topology coming from H\G/Γ0 .
   For any subset A ⊆ L = gL0 , the S-span S · A is a free S-module whose S-rank equals
the dimension over k of the k-vector space spanned by g −1 A.
(2.3). The group K acts on Y , and in fact

                                       K\Y = X/Γ0 ,

since both are (HK)\G/Γ0 . However, the points of view on the two sides of this equation
are different: K\Y is a space of lattices modulo rotations, while X/Γ0 is a homogeneous
space modulo an arithmetic group. We now make explicit how to go back and forth between
the two sides.
Definition. A marked lattice in S n is a function f : L0 → S n of the form f (x) = gx for
g ∈ G. We shall identify marked lattices that differ only by a homothety, i.e. f and hf for
h ∈ H.
   Let Y ′ = H\G be the set of marked lattices. A marked lattice f gives rise to an
ordinary lattice L ∈ Y by setting L = f (L0 ). This realizes the projection Y ′ = H\G →
Y = H\G/Γ0 . On the other hand, f (x) = gx gives a point (HK)g ∈ X, which realizes the
projection Y ′ = H\G → X = (HK)\G. The right action of g1 ∈ G on Y ′ sends f : x 7→ gx
6                          AVNER ASH AND MARK MCCONNELL

to x 7→ gg1 x. The left action of k1 ∈ K on Y ′ sends f to k1 · f . Diagram (2.3.1) shows
these spaces.

                                           (arithmetic quotient)

(2.4). Let f be a marked lattice, fixed within its homothety class. Let L = f (L0 ). The
arithmetic minimum of f is defined to be m(f ) = min{kak | a ∈ L − {0}}. This number is
positive. The set of minimal vectors of f is defined to be M (f ) = {a ∈ L | kak = m(L)}.
   The definitions of m(f ) and M (f ) use only the image L of f , so they descend to functions
m(L) and M (L) on Y . On the other hand, m(f ) and M (f ) are K-equivariant, since K
preserves k . . . k.
   Unless otherwise specified, we normalize f (resp. L) in its homothety class so that m(f )
(resp. m(L)) equals 1.

(2.5). Definition. A marked lattice f is well-rounded if M (f ) spans S n as S-module.

    By the Γ0 -invariance and K-equivariance noted in (2.4), we get a definition of well-
rounded elements in all the spaces in (2.3.1). For instance, a point in X is well-rounded
if and only if, for the class of marked lattices f mod K that represents it, one (and hence
each) of the M (f ) spans S n as S-module. The definitions in X/Γ0 and Y are similar.

Definition. W is the set of well-rounded elements in X. We call this the well-rounded
retract in X. For any arithmetic group Γ ⊆ Γ0 , W/Γ is called the well-rounded retract in
X/Γ.

In Section 4, we will explain why these are deformation retracts.

(2.6). Example of GLn (Z). As in (1.6), take k = Q and G = GLn (R). If L0 is the
standard lattice Zn ⊂ Rn , then Γ0 = GLn (Z), and Y is the set of all rank-n lattices in Rn
mod homotheties. The product h , i is the standard dot product.
   Let’s work out the GL2 (Z) case in detail. For each marked lattice f : L0 → R2 ,
rotate the image until f ((1, 0)) lies on the positive x-axis, and use a homothety tomake
kf ((1, 0))k = 1. This identifies X with the upper half-plane h by sending x = HK 10 ab
(with b > 0) to the point a + bi ∈ h. The well-rounded retract W is the tree shown in the

domain for GL2 (Z) is the right-hand half of F , namely F ∗ = {a + bi ∈ F | a > 0}, shown
with double hatching. The space X/Γ0 is homeomorphic to F ∗ . The retract W/Γ0 is
identified with the bottom arc of F ∗ .

                  Section 3—The Borel-Serre Compactification
   In this section we recall the construction of the Borel-Serre manifold with corners X̄,
and we summarize facts about flags and parabolic subgroups. The main goal of the section
is Proposition 3.6, which relates the geodesic action on X to the idea of rescaling a lattice
in directions given by a fixed flag F .

(3.1). Recall that Q T = {diag(a1 , . . . , an )} is a maximal Q-split torus in G. The set of
Q-roots of G with respect to Q T is {ai a−1   j | 1 6 i 6= j 6 n}. Fix the fundamental system
                         −1
of simple roots ∆ = {ai ai+1 | i = 1, . . . , n − 1}.

(3.2). We recall some facts about parabolic Q-subgroups and flags. Let {e1 , . . . , en } be
the standard k-basis of k n . Let J ⊆ ∆. Form a graph with vertices in {1, . . . , n} and
with an edge joining vertices i and i + 1 if and only if ai a−1     i+1 ∈ J. The graph has
l = #(∆ − J) + 1 connected components. Say the j-th component in order from left to
right has νj vertices. Consider the flag FJ = {0 $ V1 $ · · · $ Vl = k n } in which Vj is
spanned by {e1 , . . . , eν1 +···+νj }. The standard parabolic Q-subgroup PJ is the subgroup
of G such that PJ (Q) is the stabilizer of FJ in G(Q). In the coordinates of (1.2), PJ has
the usual block upper-triangular form, with diagonal blocks of sizes ν1 × ν1 , . . . , νl × νl .
Every parabolic Q-subgroup P of G is conjugate by some g ∈ G(Q) to a unique PJ .
   Let PJ = PJ (R), and P = P(R) in general.
8                             AVNER ASH AND MARK MCCONNELL

   For g ∈ G(Q), the group of Q-points of g −1 PJ g is the stabilizer of the flag F = g −1 FJ .
Any flag of the latter form is called a Q-flag. There is a one-to-one correspondence between
the parabolic Q-subgroups and the Q-flags they stabilize. We write F ′ ⊇ F if every Vj
belonging to F is also a member of F ′ .
   For the Q-flag F = {0 $ V1 $ · · · $ Vl = k n }, we set #F = l. Thus #F = n when P
is a Borel subgroup, #F = 2 for maximal proper P , and #F = 1 when P = G.
(3.3). Let Q TJ be the subgroup of Q T in which the i-th and (i + 1)-st diagonal entries
                        −1
are equal whenever ti ti+1 ∈ J. Let TJ be the identity component of Q TJ (R), and let
AJ = H\TJ .
   Let P = g −1 PJ g for g ∈ G(Q). There is a semi-direct product decomposition P =
MP TP UP . Here UP is the unipotent radical of P , TP = g −1 TJ g, and MP TP is the unique
Levi subgroup of P which is stable under the Cartan involution of G which fixes g −1 Kg.
We set AP = H\TP .
   When P ⊆ P ′ , AP ′ is naturally identified with a subgroup of AP by taking the kernel
of appropriate roots in ∆.
(3.4). We recall the definition of the geodesic action [B-S, §3]. Let P = g −1 PJ g for
g ∈ G(Q). Let Z be the identity component of the center of MP TP . Let y ∈ X. There is
a p ∈ P with y = HKgp. For any z ∈ Z, define

                                                y o z = HKgzp.

The right side is independent of the choices of g and p. This action of Z is the geodesic
action on X associated to P . It is a proper and free action, and it commutes with the
ordinary action of P . The group AP is contained in H\Z, so it operates on X by the
geodesic action.
(3.5). We recall the construction of X̄ [B-S, §§5–7]. The roots in ∆ − J determine an
isomorphism between AJ and (0, ∞)l−1 , sending the point

                    diag(a1 , . . . , a1 , . . . , al , . . . , al )   (aj > 0, mod H)

to (a1 a−1                −1
        2 , . . . , al−1 al ) ∈ (0, ∞)
                                       l−1
                                           . Let ĀJ be the partial compactification of AJ corre-
                        l−1
sponding to [0, ∞)          under this isomorphism. The corner X(PJ ) associated to PJ is the
fiber product X(PJ ) = X ×AJ ĀJ , where AJ acts on X by the geodesic action. Conjugating
by an element of G(Q), we define ĀP and a corner X(P ) = X ×AP ĀP for any P .
   Whenever P ⊆ P ′ , there is a map X(P ′ ) ֒→ X(P ) induced by the inclusion on X;
we identify X(P ′ ) with its image under this map. As a set, X̄ is the union of the X(P )
over all P . One puts on X̄ the topology such that the original topology on each corner is
preserved, X̄ is Hausdorff, and Γ acts properly on X̄ with a compact quotient.
   Let e(P ) be the set corresponding to X ×AP {0}l−1 in the corner X(P ) = X ×AP ĀP .
As a set, X̄ is the disjoint union of X and the e(P ) for all proper parabolic Q-subgroups
P . We call e(P ) the boundary face corresponding to P .
            COHOMOLOGY AT INFINITY AND THE WELL-ROUNDED RETRACT                                    9

                                                              `
    Let ē(P ) be the closure of e(P ) in X̄. We have ē(P ) = P ′ ⊆P e(P ′ ). The sets ē(P1 ) and
ē(P2 ) are disjoint unless P1 ∩P2 is a parabolic Q-subgroup P3 , in which case ē(P1 )∩ē(P2 ) =
ē(P3 ).
    Notice that the largest subgroup of Γ which stabilizes X(P ), e(P ), and ē(P ) is Γ ∩ P .
    Modding out by the geodesic action of AP gives a (Γ ∩ P )-equivariant bundle map
qP : X(P ) → e(P ). The orbits in X(P ) under MP UP are sections of this bundle called
the canonical cross-sections.
(3.6). We now present a central tool of the paper, an interpretation of the geodesic action
in the setting of marked lattices.
    Let f be a marked lattice. Let F = {0 = V0 $ · · · $ Vl = k n } be a Q-flag, with
P = g −1 PJ g the parabolic Q-subgroup determined by F . Throughout the paper, we will
abuse notation by writing f (Vj ∩ L0 ) ⊗Q R ⊆ S n as f (Vj ); this is an S-linear subspace of
S n , of S-rank equal to dimk Vj . Set V̌j equal to the orthogonal complement of f (Vj−1 ) in
f (Vj ) with respect to h, i. We have S n = V̌1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V̌l as an orthogonal direct sum.
Definition. Let A∗F,f be the group of R-linear maps S n → S n which act by positive real
homotheties on each summand V̌j separately. Let AF,f = A∗F,f /H. We call AF,f the
orthogonal scaling group with respect to F and f .
   Note that every α ∈ A∗F,f is S-linear. The group AF,f acts on Y ′ via f1 7→ α · f1 .
However, it does not act on X. (The next proposition will show that AF,f acts on Y ′ =
H\G as a lift of the action of AP on X = HK\G, but this lift is only determined by an
arbitrary choice of an element of K. The choice is encoded in f .)
   Let Ψ : Y ′ = H\G → X = HK\G be the projection. Let y = Ψ(f ). Let ι : AP → AF,f
be the following map: if z ∈ AP with

(3.6.1)              z = g −1 diag(a1 , . . . , a1 , . . . , al , . . . , al )g   (aj > 0),
                                   | {z }                    | {z }
                                              ν1                    νl


let ι(z) be the element of AF,f which (for each j = 1, . . . , l) acts on V̌j by the scalar aj . It
is clear that ι is an isomorphism of groups.
Proposition. For any z ∈ AP , with ι as above,

(3.6.2)                                       y o z = Ψ(ι(z) · f ).


Remark. The proposition is stated in [G, (2.4)], without proof.
Proof. We use the notation of (3.4). Write y = HKgp and p = g −1 pJ g for pJ ∈ PJ .
Consider the marked lattice f1 : x 7→ gpx = pJ gx. Since Ψ(f1 ) = y = Ψ(f ), we may
choose a k1 ∈ K such that f1 = k1 · f .
  Write z ∈ AP as z = g −1 zJ g for zJ = diag(a1 , . . . , a1 , . . . , al , . . . , al ) ∈ AJ . Then

                                      y o z = HKgzp = HKzJ pJ g.
10                            AVNER ASH AND MARK MCCONNELL

The marked lattice fz : x → zJ pJ gx descends mod K to y o z.
   Let IJ be the flag in S n whose j-th member is the coordinate subspace spanned by
{e1 , . . . , eν1 +···+νj }. (This IJ is essentially FJ ⊗Q R.) The map x 7→ gx carries F to IJ ,
and the further multiplication by pJ and zJ preserves IJ . Thus for any z ∈ AP , fz (Vj )
is exactly the j-th member of IJ . (The idea is that, out of the whole K-equivalence class
of marked lattices representing y o z, fz is a representative for which the fz (Vj ) will be in
standard position.) The orthocomplement of fz (Vj−1 ) in fz (Vj ) is the coordinate subspace
Ej spanned by {eν1 +···+νj−1 +1 , . . . , eν1 +···+νj }. The Ej are orthogonal, and zJ acts by the
map α1 : S n → S n characterized by the property that it acts on each Ej by the scalar aj .
In short, the left-hand side of (3.6.2) is the projection under Ψ of the marked lattice given
                         f1       α
by the composition L0 → S n →1 S n .
    On the right-hand side of (3.6.2), observe that Ψ(α · f ) = Ψ(k1 α · f ) = Ψ((k1 αk1−1 )f1 ).
Since f1 = k1 · f , the orthogonal complement of k1 · f (Vj−1 ) in k1 · f (V ) equals that of
f1 (Vj−1 ) in f1 (Vj ); this says exactly that k1 · V̌j = Ej for all j. It is immediate that
k1 αk1−1 is the same map as α1 . Thus the right-hand side of (3.6.2) is also Ψ applied to the
                 f1     α
composition L0 → S n →1 S n .         
Note. We will always normalize elements of AP and AF,f in their classes modulo H so
that a1 = 1.
(3.7). While AP and AF,f act on different spaces, we use similar notation for the two
actions. We write
                          ρ = (ρ1 , . . . , ρl−1 ) ∈ (0, ∞)l−1
for a point in either group. The ρi are the coordinates coming from the simple roots
in J: that is, ρj = aj /aj+1 for j = 1, . . . , l − 1. By Proposition 3.6, the point of AF,f
corresponding to (ρ1 , . . . , ρl−1 ) acts on V̌j by the scalar

(3.7.1)                       aj = (ρ1 · · · ρj−1 )−1   (j = 2, . . . , l).

(Because of our normalizations, the action on V̌1 is by 1.)
Remark. The ρj ’s are good coordinates for rescaling sublattices within lattices, while the
aj are the natural coordinates for the geodesic action. Though (3.7.1) is messy, we cannot
avoid using it, since part of our goal is to relate lattices and the geodesic action. The
inverses in (3.7.1) arise because the well-rounded retraction goes away from the Borel-
Serre boundary.
   Multiplication in AP corresponds to coordinate-wise multiplication of the ρi . As in (3.5),
the ρj extend to coordinates on ĀP with (ρ1 , . . . , ρl−1 ) ∈ [0, ∞)l−1 . Going to infinity in
X(P ) means going to zero in the ρj variables. We introduce a partial ordering on AP and
ĀP , where (ρ1 , . . . , ρl−1 ) 6 (ρ′1 , . . . , ρ′l−1 ) if and only if ρj 6 ρ′j for each j.
   The action of ρ = (ρ1 , . . . , ρl−1 ) on Y ′ is denoted f 7→ ρ · f . This descends mod Γ0
to an action L 7→ ρ · L on Y . Descending mod K as in Proposition 3.6, ρ · x denotes the
geodesic action on points x of X or X/(Γ ∩ P ).

(3.8). We will need to consider Q-flags M = {0 $ M (1) ⊆ M (2) ⊆ · · · ⊆ M (n) = k n }
in which some of the inclusions can be equalities. If F is obtained from M by replacing
each string of equalities with a single space Vj , we call F the irredundant version of M.
If A is the orthogonal scaling group with respect to this flag and some f , we always write
ρ = (ρ1 , . . . , ρl−1 ) ∈ A with reference to F , not M.

                      Section 4—The Well-Rounded Retraction
   In this section, we define the well-rounded retraction rt . The material comes from [A3],
though we emphasize different things (marked lattices, the flag of successive minima).
(4.1). Let f be a marked lattice, with L = f (L0 ). We normalize f up to homothety so
that m(f ) = 1. If V ⊆ k n is a k-subspace, f (V ) ⊗Q R is abbreviated f (V ).
   Recall that Y ′ = H\G is the space of marked lattices (2.3). For i = 1, . . . , n, let

                             Yi′ = {f ∈ Y ′ | rankS (S · M (f )) > i}.

Observe that Y ′ = Y1′ ⊃ Y2′ ⊃ · · · , and that Yn′ is the set of well-rounded elements of
                                                                            (i)
Y ′ . For i = 1, . . . , n − 1, we will define a deformation retraction rt : Yi′ × [0, 1] → Yi′
                ′
with image Yi+1    . The deformation retraction will be equivariant for both the K and Γ0
actions. For any f ∈ Y ′ , we will also define a Q-flag M = {0 ⊆ M (1) ⊆ · · · ⊆ M (n) = k n }
depending on f . (This M could have equalities, as in (3.8).) The definitions proceed
simultaneously by induction on i.
                                               (i−1)
    Let f1 = f , and for i > 1 let fi = r1           (fi−1 ) inductively. Let M (i) be the k-span
of fi−1 (M (fi )). This is a subspace of k n of dimension > i. If fi is in Yi+1    ′
                                                                                      already, set
 (i)
rt (fi ) = fi for all t ∈ [0, 1], and set µi = 1. Otherwise, consider the S-linear maps
ϕµ obtained by multiplying in fi (M (i) ) by 1 and in the orthocomplement fi (M (i) )⊥ by a
scalar µ > 0. By [A3, p. 463], there is a unique smallest µi ∈ (0, 1) such that

(4.1.1)                ϕµi · fi still has arithmetic minimum equal to 1.

                        ′              (i)
This ϕµi · fi lies in Yi+1 . We set rt (fi ) = ϕ1+(µi −1)t · fi . This is continuous in both the
                                                         (i)                           (i)
fi and t variables, and defines a homotopy between r0 = (identity on Yi′ ) and r1 : Yi′ ։

Yi+1 .
Definition. The well-rounded retraction rt on Y ′ is obtained by composing the deforma-
                  (i)
tion retractions rt in the order i = 1, . . . , n − 1. More precisely, rt : Y ′ × [0, 1] → Y ′ is
given by
                                  (i)              (i−1)            (1)
                       rt (f ) = rt(n−1)−(i−1) ◦ r1      ◦ · · · ◦ r1 (f ),
                                         i−1    i
where i is determined by the rule t ∈ [ n−1  , n−1 ] for i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}.
  Let r = r1 . We will also call this the well-rounded retraction.
   Notice that M (i+1) ⊇ M (i) by construction. This gives the
12                          AVNER ASH AND MARK MCCONNELL

Definition. The flag of successive minima for f is the Q-flag M = {0 ⊆ M (1) ⊆ · · · ⊆
. . . M (n) = k n }.
  This M is an invariant of f ’s class mod K, and is equivariant for Γ0 . It is a “lower
semi-continuous” function of f in the sense that for any f ∈ Y ′ , there is a neighborhood
U of f such that for all f ′ ∈ U , the flag M′ of successive minima for f ′ satisfies M′ ⊆ M.
(4.2). Remark. Once the inductive construction of r is completed, we obtain the following
interpretation of r(f ) as the result of applying a geodesic action to f . Let M be the flag
of successive minima for f , with irredundant version F . Let µ = (µ−1              −1
                                                                       1 , . . . , µn−1 ) ∈ AF,f
with the µi depending on f as in (4.1). (As in (3.8), µ−1i is omitted when M (i) = M (i+1) .)
Then
                                          r(f ) = µ · f.

(4.3). We now adapt the definition of the well-rounded retraction to the other spaces
in (2.3.1). In each case, the retraction will still be denoted rt for t ∈ [0, 1], with r = r1 ,
and will be called the “well-rounded retraction”.
   The whole construction is Γ0 - and K-equivariant. Hence rt descends to deformation
retractions of Y onto the set of well-rounded lattices, of X onto W , and of X/Γ onto W/Γ
for any Γ ⊆ Γ0 of finite index.
   We recall the main theorem of [A3].
Theorem. The map rt is a Γ0 -equivariant deformation retraction of X onto W . The
quotient W/Γ0 is compact. The dimension of W and W/Γ0 is the virtual cohomological
dimension of Γ0 , which equals dim X − (n − 1). The space W has a natural structure as a
cell complex on which Γ0 acts cell-wise with finite stabilizers of cells. The first barycentric
subdivision of the cell structure descends to a finite cell complex structure on W/Γ0 .
     The example of GL2 (Z) is discussed in (6.3).
Remark. When the class number h of k is > 1, [A3] defines a whole (h − 1)-dimensional
family of retracts, depending on a parameter called a set of weights. For simplicity, we
will use only the trivial set of weights (identically equal to 1). Readers may easily make
the needed changes if they wish to use a non-trivial set of weights.

                  Section 5—Summary of Notational Conventions
   The letter f always stands for a marked lattice f : x 7→ gx for g ∈ G, modulo the
homotheties H. We let L = f (L0 ), sometimes without explicit mention. We let L′ be the
lattice for f ′ , etc. As in (3.6), f (Vj ∩ L0 ) ⊗Q R ⊆ S n will be written f (Vj ). Let V̌j be the
orthogonal complement of f (Vj−1 ) in f (Vj ), so that S n = V̌1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V̌l as an orthogonal
direct sum. As in (2.4), lattices are always scaled by a homothety so that their shortest
non-zero vector has length 1.
   For the rest of the paper, P denotes the real points of a parabolic Q-subgroup. Let
F = {0 $ V1 $ · · · $ . . . Vl = k n } be the Q-flag for P as in (3.2), and A = AF,f the
orthogonal scaling group with respect to F and f (see (3.6)–(3.7)).
            COHOMOLOGY AT INFINITY AND THE WELL-ROUNDED RETRACT                             13

   Whenever we mention P , the letters F and A will refer to the objects corresponding to
P , and vice versa. The symbol P ′ is associated to F ′ and A′ , etc.
   From Section 6 on, we will often write f for the point that f determines in X or X/Γ.
We will speak of marked lattices f “in” X or W , or write L for the point that L determines
in X/Γ. These abuses are justified because our constructions involving marked lattices are
K-equivariant.

                                Section 6—The Sets WF
(6.1). Throughout this section, F = {0 = V0 $ V1 $ · · · Vl = k n } will be a fixed Q-flag.
Definition. Let WF be the set of all marked lattices f in W such that for all j = 1, . . . , l,
                                S · (M (L) ∩ f (Vj )) = f (Vj ).

   (WF was called W ′ in the introduction.) Geometrically, WF consists of the lattices
L = f (L0 ) whose intersection with each subspace f (Vj ) is well-rounded in that subspace.
By the definition of the cell structure on W [A3, pp. 466–7], WF is a closed subcomplex
of W and is stable under Γ ∩ P . A cell in WF is said to respect F . If F = γF ′ for γ ∈ Γ,
then the images of WF and WF ′ in W/Γ are equal. The Q-flags fall into only finitely many
equivalence classes mod Γ, so only finitely many distinct subcomplexes of W/Γ arise in
this way.
   If M is a Q-flag with possible equalities (3.8), and F is the irredundant version of M,
let WM = WF .
(6.2). The following is immediate from the definitions in (4.1).
Lemma. If f has flag of successive minima M, then r(f ) ∈ WM .
(6.3). Example of GL2 (Z). Refer again to the picture in (2.6). For the standard flag
F = {0 $ Q · (1, 0) $ Q2 } with associated P , the space WF is the horizontal sequence of
arcs forming the top of W . The boundary face e(P ) in X̄ (not shown) is the horizontal line
at b = ∞. The geodesic action by AP flows straight up, pushing X upward to converge
to e(P ). The well-rounded retraction pulls the region above W straight down onto WF .
For torsion-free Γ, e(P )/(Γ ∩ P ) and WF /(Γ ∩ P ) are homeomorphic to circles, and the
well-rounded retraction induces the obvious isomorphism between the cohomology of these
spaces. (The situation is more complicated for n > 2, when the boundary faces are no
longer disjoint.)
Remark. For small n, the WF /(Γ ∩ P ) are all readily computable. See (10.6).

                    Section 7—Neighborhoods of Infinity in X̄
   We now prove our main results explaining the connection between the well-rounded
retraction r, the geodesic action, and the topology of the Borel-Serre boundary. Parts
(7.1)–(7.4) give a chain of propositions that allow us to define a tubular neighborhood N̄F
of e(P ) (called N̄ and e in the introduction). In (7.5)–(7.6) we prove that r : X → W has
the continuous extension r̄ : X̄ → W , where (for all F ) r̄ is constant on the fibers of N̄F
and carries N̄F onto WF .

(7.1). Fix a marked lattice f , with L = f (L0 ). As in (4.1), let M = {0 ⊆ M (1) ⊆ · · · ⊆
M (n) = k n } be the flag of successive minima for f . Let F be the irredundant version
of M, with associated P . Let A = AF,f . Let f ′′ = r(f ) be the image of f under the
well-rounded retraction.
   The idea of the following lemma is that if f is close enough to e(P ), then the well-
rounded retraction carries the whole orthant {ρρ ∈ A | ρ 6 1} · f to a single point of
W . The lemma says that, to know that f is “close enough” to e(P ), it suffices to know
that f ’s flag of successive minima is the flag F corresponding to P (or at least contains
this F —see (7.2)).
Lemma. Let f , M, F , P , and A be as above. For any ρ = (ρ1 , . . . , ρl−1 ) ∈ A with
ρ 6 (1, . . . , 1), f ′ = ρ · f satisfies r(f ′ ) = r(f ) = f ′′ . The common image f ′′ will lie in
WM = WF .
Proof. It suffices to prove the lemma when ρ = (1, . . . , 1, ρj , 1, . . . , 1) for a fixed ρj 6 1;
the general case follows by applying this for each j. Let i be the unique index such that
Vj = M (i) and M (i) $ M (i+1) .
   The marked lattices f and f ′ agree on L0 ∩ M (i) , since ρ acts by 1 in that region. For
x ∈ L0 with x ∈   / M (i) , no vector f ′ (x) is shorter than the corresponding vector f (x),
since ρ magnifies lengths in the directions perpendicular to f (M (i) ) by ρ−1        j    > 1. And
                                                                                        (1)
f (x) cannot be a minimal vector of f , since the minimal vectors lie in f (M ), which is
contained in f (M (i) ). It follows that the well-rounded retractions for f and f ′ will proceed
exactly the same up through the end of the r (i−1) step—that is, if µι and µ′ι (for f and f ′
resp.) are as in (4.1), then

(7.1.1)                                   µι = µ′ι for all ι < i.
           (i−1)        (1)                   (i−1)                  (1)
Set g = r1     ◦ · · ·◦ r1 (f ) and g ′ = r1         ◦ · · ·◦ r1 (f ′ ). It follows from (3.7.1) and (7.1.1)
                                                        (i)
that g ′ = (1, . . . , 1, ρ−1
                           j , 1, . . . , 1) · g. The rt     stage of the retraction will, by definition,
carry g to

(7.1.2)                               (1, . . . , 1, µ−1
                                                      i , 1, . . . , 1) · g,

and carry g ′ to
                                                          −1
(7.1.3)                              (1, . . . , 1, µ′i        , 1, . . . , 1) · g ′ .
                                                                                         −1
However, by the uniqueness statement in (4.1.1), µ−1  i  must equal µ′i ρi . Thus the marked
                                                  (i+1)
lattices (7.1.2) and (7.1.3) will coincide. The r       and later stages of the retraction will
agree on this common lattice, so the final values r(f ) and r(f ′ ) are equal. By (6.2),
f ′′ ∈ WM . 
(7.2). We record a corollary of the previous lemma. The idea is that if f ’s flag of successive
minima refines the flag F ′ for some P ′ , then f is “close enough” to e(P ′ ). After all, if
f is close enough to e(P ), it should be close enough to any larger Borel-Serre boundary
component e(P ′ ) that has e(P ) in its closure.

Corollary. Let the notation be as in (7.1). Let F ′ be any Q-flag with F ′ ⊆ F , and let A′
be the orthogonal scaling group for F ′ and f . Then for any ρ ∈ A′ with ρ 6 (1, . . . , 1), ρ · f
and f map to the same point under the well-rounded retraction. This point lies in WF ′ .

Proof. This is trivial, since A′ is naturally a subgroup of A, and WF ⊆ WF ′ .                                        

(7.3). In (7.1) we took an f close to e(P ) and studied the orthant {ρρ 6 1} · f . Now,
instead, we take an arbitrary f . We show in (7.3) (actually in the corollary) that there is
a t ∈ A which pushes f so close to e(P ) that the orthant {ρρ 6 t} · f still has the property
of (7.1)—namely, r maps it to a single point in WF .

Lemma. Choose any marked lattice f . Fix a Q-flag F = {0 $ V1 $ · · · $ Vl = k n }, and
let A = AF,f . Then there exists t = (t1 , . . . , tl−1 ) ∈ A, depending on f , such that for any
ρ ∈ A with ρ 6 t, the flag M′ of successive minima for f ′ = ρ · f satisfies M′ ⊇ F .

                                                                                  ◦

subspaces of V . (We must first rescale f by a homothety so that m(L) = 1; this does not
affect the value of the µi .) Let βj = µ1 · . . . · µdj −1 .
   The orthogonal projection of L = f (L0 ) onto f (Vj )⊥ is a lattice L† under the restriction
of the inner product to f (Vj )⊥ . Let αj > 0 be the length of the shortest non-zero vector
of L† .
   Let t1 = min(1, 21 α1 β1 ), and inductively let tj = min(1, 21 (t1 · . . . · tj−1 )−1 αj βj ). This
means (t1 · · · tj )−1 > 2α−1

   Now let f ′ = ρ ·f for ρ 6 t. Fix j. Let a be any vector of L lying outside f (Vj ∩L0 ). Let
b = ρ · a be the corresponding vector for f ′ . Notice that ρ multiplies V̌j+1 by (ρ1 · · · ρj )−1 ,
by (3.7.1). Since ρj 6 1 for all j, ρ multiplies by factors at least as large as (ρ1 · · · ρj )−1
in each summand of V̌j+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V̌l = f (Vj )⊥ .

          kb(j) k > k(orthogonal projection of b(j) onto f (Vj )⊥ )k
                 = µ1 · . . . · µdj −1 · k(orthogonal projection of b onto f (Vj )⊥ )k
                 = βj · k(orthogonal projection of b onto f (Vj )⊥ )k

                 >2
                 > 1.

This says that the image of L′ under the well-rounded retraction on L up through the
                                                            ◦
r (dj −1) stage is equal to (7.3.1): no vector outside L will affect the stopping times of the
retraction on L′ , since each will have length > 1 during the entire process leading to (7.3.1).
In particular, f (Vj ) is a member of M′ , the flag of successive minima of L′ , which is what
we wanted to prove. 
Corollary. With notation as in the lemma, the points ρ · f with ρ 6 t map to a common
point of WF under the well-rounded retraction r.
Proof. Apply Corollary 7.2 to the marked lattice t · f of the lemma. 
(7.4). We can now construct neighborhoods of the Borel-Serre boundary component e(P )
that are well behaved with respect to the well-rounded retraction. Fix a Q-flag F , with
its associated P .
   Recall that the corner X(P ) is a fiber bundle with base e(P ) and fiber ĀP . By a
neighborhood in X near e(P ), we mean an open set in X whose intersection with every
fiber contains {a ∈ AP | a < a0 } for some a0 ∈ AP depending on the fiber.
Proposition. There is a neighborhood NF in X near e(P ) such that, on the intersection of
NF with a fiber of X(P ), the well-rounded retraction r takes a constant value. Furthermore,
r carries NF surjectively to WF .
Proof. As in (3.5), let C1 be the canonical cross-section HK ·1·MP UP . Let f1 be a marked
lattice corresponding to a point in C1 . For this f1 , let A = AF,f1 , and let t1 ∈ A be the
point constructed in Lemma 7.3. We define

(7.4.1)                                NF = {ρρ1 · f1 | ρ 1 < t1 },

where f1 ranges over all marked lattices representing points of C1 , and t1 depends on f1 .
For any given f1 , the map r is constant on the set {ρρ1 ·f1 } = NF ∩(fiber), by Corollary 7.3.
   To prove NF is an open set in X, we must show the tj vary continuously with f1 . The
µi of (4.1) vary continuously as a function of f , by [A3, §3(i)]. Hence the βj of (7.3) vary
continuously with f . For any continuous family of lattices (not necessarily normalized
             COHOMOLOGY AT INFINITY AND THE WELL-ROUNDED RETRACT                                     17

by m(L) = 1), the function m(L) is also continuous in L; applying this to L† (defined
in (7.3)), we see the αj of (7.3) are continuous in f . Hence the tj are continuous in f .
    By Corollary 7.2, r carries NF into WF . In the rest of the proof, we prove the map
is surjective. Let f be a marked lattice representing a point in WF . Let dj = dimk Vj .
Let f1 be the marked lattice corresponding to the point in C1 in the AP -fiber through
f ; let ρ · f = f1 . Choose t for f1 as in Lemma 7.3. For a sufficiently small τ ∈ (0, 1),
τ = (τ, . . . , τ ) satisfies τ < t · ρ , implying τ · f ∈ NF . We will show r carries τ · f back to
f.
    The lattice for τ · f is the lattice for f scaled by a factor of 1/τ j−1 on V̌j . The minimal
vectors of f span their intersection with f (V1 ), by the definition of WF . Since 1/τ > 1, the
minimal vectors of τ · f are exactly the minimal vectors of f that lie in f (V1 ). Hence the
minimal vectors of τ · f lie in f (V1 ) and span f (V1 ). This means the steps r (1) , . . . , r (d1 −1)
of the well-rounded retraction are trivial.
    The retraction r (d1 ) fixes f (V1 ) and acts by a scalar µd1 6 1 on all orthogonal directions.
Consider what happens as a scalar µ descends from 1 to µd1 . The marked lattice τ · f
becomes

(7.4.2)                                  (µ−1 τ, τ, . . . , τ ) · f.

As long as 1/(µ−1 τ ) > 1, there are no new minimal vectors. But when µ−1 τ = 1, the
minimal vectors of (7.4.2) are exactly the minimal vectors of f that lie in f (V2 ). These
span f (V2 ) (again by the definition of WF ), which has rank bigger than the rank of f (V1 ).
So by (4.1.1) for i = d1 , we must have µd1 = τ , and at the end of the r (d1 ) stage we
have produced (1, τ, . . . , τ ) · f . The well-rounded retraction goes on similarly to produce
(1, 1, τ, . . . , τ ) · f , . . . , and finally (1, . . . , 1) · f = f . 

(7.5). The neighborhood NF defined in Proposition 7.4 lies in X, the interior of X̄.
We now extend it to a neighborhood N̄F of e(P ) in the corner X(P ). As in (3.7), the
identification A = AF,f1 ∼= AP extends to an identification Ā = ĀF,f1 ∼     = ĀP , where Ā
is obtained from A by allowing one or more of the ρj in (ρ1 , . . . , ρj−1 ) ∈ A to become 0.
With the notation of (7.4.1),

Definition. N̄F = {f = ρ 1 · f1 | ρ 1 ∈ ĀF,f1 , ρ 1 < t1 }, where f1 ranges over all marked
lattices representing points of C1 , and t1 depends on f1 as in Lemma 7.3.

   It is clear that N̄F is a tubular neighborhood of e(P ) in X(P ), in the sense that N̄F
is homeomorphic to e(P ) × [0, 1)l−1 with e(P ) included as e(P ) × (0, . . . , 0). Also, the set
N̄F is (Γ0 ∩ P )-invariant.

(7.6). We now define a map r̄ : X̄ → W that continuously extends the well-rounded
retraction r. Choose x ∈ X̄. If x ∈ X, let r̄(x) = r(x). Otherwise, x ∈ e(P ) for a
unique P with associated F . Hence x ∈ N̄F . Consider the fiber ϕ′ of N̄F over x. By
Proposition 7.4, r takes a constant value on ϕ′ ∩ X. Define r̄(x) to be this common value
r(ϕ′ ∩ X).
18                               AVNER ASH AND MARK MCCONNELL

Proposition. The map r̄ is a continuous Γ-equivariant extension of r to X̄. For any
Q-flag F , it is constant on the ĀP -fibers of N̄F . It is a retraction X̄ → W (i.e. it fixes W
pointwise).
Proof. It suffices to prove r̄ is constant on ϕ′ . For then, the continuity of r̄ on N̄F will follow
from the tubular neighborhood structure and the continuity of r on NF . The continuity of
r̄ on X̄ will follow from its continuity on X and on each N̄F , because these form an open
cover of X̄. The Γ-equivariance of r̄ will follow from that of r.
    Let y lie on the fiber ϕ′ of N̄F over x, with y 6= x. If y ∈ X, then r̄(x) = r(x) = r̄(y)
by construction. Next, suppose y ∈ e(P1 ) for some P1 with associated F1 . Then P1 ⊇ P .
Now AP1 is naturally a subgroup of AP by (3.3), and ĀP1 ⊂ ĀP . So ϕ′ fibers over ē(P1 )
with fibers given by the action of ĀP1 . Let ϕ′1 be the intersection of ϕ′ with the ĀP1 -fiber
of N̄F1 over y. Then
                       r̄(y) = r(ϕ′1 ∩ X)          by def. of r̄(y)

                             = r(ϕ′ ∩ X)          since ϕ′1 ∩ X ⊆ ϕ′ ∩ X, and
                                                  r is constant on the latter
                             = r̄(x)         by def. of r̄(x).
This proves r̄ is constant on the ĀP -fibers of N̄F .
  Finally, r̄ fixes W pointwise because r does. 

                       Section 8—Extending the Deformation
                      Retraction to the Borel-Serre Boundary
(8.1). We recall from [S] some facts about Saper’s tiling of X̄. Saper constructs a Γ-
equivariant subspace X0 of X called the central tile. This is a codimension-zero submani-
fold with corners in X. The closed boundary faces ∂ P X0 are in one-to-one correspondence
with the proper parabolic Q-subgroups P ; inclusions P ⊆ P ′ correspond to inclusions
             ′
∂ P X0 ⊆ ∂ P X0 , and conversely. Every y ∈ ∂X0 lies on ∂ P X0 for a unique smallest P .
There is a Γ-equivariant piecewise-analytic deformation retraction rS : X̄ → X0 ; more
precisely, rS fits into a piecewise-analytic family rt,S for t ∈ [0, 1] with r0,S =(identity on
X̄) and r1,S = rS . The retraction rS is uniquely characterized by
(8.1.1)           rS (y o a) = y        whenever y ∈ ∂ P X0 and a ∈ ĀP , a 6 1.
The converse of (8.1.1) also holds: if y ∈ ∂ P X0 , and P is the smallest with this property,
then
(8.1.2)          rS (y ′ ) = y    implies     ∃a ∈ ĀP , a 6 1, such that y ′ = y o a.
   For any arithmetic subgroup Γ, the quotient X0 /Γ is compact. Also, for any P and
given any open neighborhood U of ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P ) in X̄/Γ, we may choose X0 so that
(8.1.3)                                     ∂ P X0 /(Γ ∩ P ) ⊆ U.
In fact, given any central tile, we may choose enlargements of it whose complements in X̄,
modulo Γ, form a fundamental system of neighborhoods of ∂ X̄/Γ in X̄/Γ.

(8.2). We will now fix a certain Γ-invariant open neighborhood B of ∂ X̄ in X̄. There are
only finitely many classes of Q-flags mod Γ. Let F represent such a class. Let N̄F be the
tubular neighborhood of e(P ) in X(P ) as in (7.6), and let
                                             [[
                                       B=               γ · N̄F .
                                                F γ∈Γ


Clearly B/Γ is an open neighborhood of ∂ X̄/Γ in X̄/Γ.
  From now on, we fix a central tile X0 with the following properties:
                  S S
    (i) ∂ P X0 ⊆ F ′ γ∈Γ∩P (γ · N̄F ′ ) for any proper parabolic Q-subgroup P with as-
        sociated F , where F ′ runs through a set of (Γ ∩ P )-representatives of Q-flags
        containing F (the number of such representatives is finite);
   (ii) ∂X0 ⊆ B, and X0 ∪ B = X̄;
  (iii) the well-rounded retract W lies in the interior of X0 .
By (8.1.3), it is possible to arrange for (i). Part (ii) follows from (i), since there are only
finitely many F mod Γ. To arrange for (iii), recall that W/Γ is compact, so that there is
a Γ-invariant open neighborhood of ∂ X̄ in X̄ whose closure does not meet W ; enlarge X0
if necessary so that its boundary lies in this neighborhood.
(8.3). We now construct the map Rt described in (0.3).
Definition. The map Rt : X̄ × [0, 1] → X̄ is given as follows. If t ∈ [0, 12 ], let Rt (x) =
r2t,S (x). If t ∈ [ 12 , 1], let Rt (x) = r2t−1 (rS (x)).
                                            1
   The map Rt is well-defined after t =     2
                                                because the image of rS lies in X (not ∂ X̄), and
r is defined on X.
Proposition. The map Rt is a Γ-equivariant deformation retraction of X̄ onto W .
Proof. Rt is Γ-equivariant, since both rt,S and rt have this property. Since W ⊆ X0 by (iii)
in (8.2), W is fixed pointwise by rS . We know W is fixed pointwise by r. Hence the image
of R1 is at least W . On the other hand, the image is contained in W because the image
of r is W . 
(8.4). We now show that our global retraction r̄ of (7.6) is really a deformation retraction.
Theorem. r̄ = R1 .
Proof. If x ∈ X0 , then rS does not move x, and R1 (x) = r(x) = r̄(x). Next, assume x ∈ X̄
with x ∈ / X0 . The retraction rS carries x to a point y, and there is a unique smallest P
such that y lies on the face ∂ P X0 . However, by (8.1.2), x is of the form x = y o a for some
a ∈ ĀP , a 6 1. By (8.2) part (i), y ∈ N̄F ′′ for some F ′′ ⊇ F . Since ĀP ⊆ ĀP ′′ , we have
x ∈ N̄F ′′ , and x lies on the same ĀP ′′ -fiber of N̄F ′′ as y. By (7.6) applied to F ′′ , we have
r̄(x) = r̄(y). But r̄(y) = r(y) = R1 (x) by the definition of Rt . 
(8.5). Here is a simple consequence of Theorem 8.4.

Corollary. The map r̄ : X̄ → W is a Γ-equivariant homotopy equivalence. X̄/Γ and W/Γ
have the same homotopy type via the map r̄ mod Γ.
     We now generalize this corollary to all the boundary components.
Theorem. Let P be a proper parabolic Q-subgroup, with associated F . Then r̄ induces a
(Γ ∩ P )-equivariant homotopy equivalence of ē(P ) and WF .
Proof. We must define a (Γ ∩ P )-equivariant homotopy inverse s̄ for r̄ |ē(P ) . Choose a
point x ∈ WF , represented by a marked lattice f . Let τ = (τ, . . . , τ ) ∈ A = AF,f . We
define s̄(x) to be the point of X̄ corresponding to

(8.5.1)                                         lim τ · f.
                                              τ →0+

For all τ > 0, τ · f lies in a single AP -fiber of X. Let qP be as in (3.5). It is clear that the
limit in (8.5.1) is qP (x). Thus an equivalent definition is

(8.5.2)                          s̄ is the restriction of qP to WF .

By (8.5.2), s̄ is continuous. Since qP commutes with the action of P , s̄ is (Γ∩P )-equivariant.
   We now show that r̄◦s̄ is the identity on WF . For a sufficiently small τ0 > 0, (τ0 , . . . , τ0 )·
f will lie in NF . By (7.6), the value of r̄ on the point (τ, . . . , τ ) · f is the same for all
τ ∈ [0, τ0 ]. Using (8.5.1), r̄ ◦ s̄(x) = r̄((τ0 , . . . , τ0 )·f ). However, the proof of Proposition 7.4
shows r̄((τ0 , . . . , τ0 ) · f ) = f .
   Next, we show s̄ ◦ r̄ |ē(P ) is homotopic to the identity on ē(P ). Consider the family of
maps

(8.5.3)                           qP ◦ Rt        restricted to ē(P ).

Here Rt is from (8.3), and qP is extended continuously to a neighborhood of ē(P ) in X̄ in
a natural way [B-S, (5.5)]. (A dangerous mistake would be to assume that the canonical
cross-sections in X(P ) extend over ē(P ) as cross-sections of qP .) The function in (8.5.3) is
continuous because the image of ē(P ) under Rt lies in ē(P ) ∪ X, where qP is continuous.
At t = 0, (8.5.3) is the identity ē(P ) → ē(P ). At t = 1, for any x ∈ ē(P ),

                               qP ◦ R1 (x) = qP (r̄(x))        by (8.4)
                                             = s̄(r̄(x))     by (8.5.2).

Thus qP ◦Rt affords a (Γ∩P )-equivariant homotopy between s̄◦ r̄|ē(P ) and the identity. 
Remark. Formula (8.5.3) defines a well-rounded retraction within ē(P ) itself, carrying ē(P )
onto a subset of e(P ) homeomorphic to WF . We know that ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P ) is a compacti-
fication of a bundle whose base is a locally symmetric space (perhaps with finite quotient
singularities) for a group of lower rank, and whose fiber is an arithmetic quotient of UP .
Accordingly, there is a cellular quotient map from WF /(Γ ∩ P ) to the well-rounded retract
in the lower-rank locally symmetric space. This map may be constructed by dualizing the
techniques of [M2]; see (10.7).

                             Section 9—The Main Results
   In (9.5) we establish our main result, as we construct the spectral sequence described
in the introduction. The bulk of the proofs resides in (9.2)–(9.4). We set up two spectral
sequences, one (9.2.1) computing the cohomology of the Borel-Serre boundary ∂ X̄/Γ, and
the other (9.3.1) based on the subcomplexes WF /(Γ ∩ P ) in the well-rounded retract W/Γ.
Because the map r̄ gives homotopy equivalences on X̄/Γ and all its faces, it induces an
isomorphism between these spectral sequences, and between their abutments. We set up
canonical maps H ∗ (X/Γ) → (9.2.1) and H ∗ (W/Γ) → (9.3.1). Finally, we show that the
map H ∗ (W/Γ) → (9.3.1) computes the canonical restriction map H ∗ (X̄/Γ) → H ∗ (∂ X̄/Γ).
(9.1). Let Ap,q be any first-quadrant double complex. There are two standard filtrations
of the double complex, {Ap,q | q > q0 } and {Ap,q | p > p0 }. The spectral sequences these
give are called respectively the type I and type II sequences for Ap,q . Our main results
involve type II sequences. The cohomology of the single complex associated to Ap,q is
called the abutment of (either) spectral sequence.
   Throughout the paper, (co)homology groups have coefficients in any fixed abelian group.
(9.2). We set up a Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence for the cohomology of ∂ X̄/Γ. Let
Φl be a set of representatives of the Γ-equivalence classes of the Q-flags F = {0 $ V1 $
· · · $ Vl = k n } (see (3.2)). There are only finitely many such equivalence classes. Let
E = {ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P ) | F ∈ Φ2 } (corresponding to maximal proper parabolic Q-subgroups).
This E is a cover of ∂ X̄/Γ. By (3.5), the non-empty (p + 1)-fold intersections of distinct
members of E are exactly the sets in {ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P ) | F ∈ Φp+2 }. This means we are in
the correct setting to use the Čech cohomology techniques of [B-T, §15].
     For 0 6 p 6 n − 2, define
                                       M
                               X p,q =      C q (ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P )),
                                       F∈Φp+2

where C q denotes the singular q-cochains. We make X p,q into a double complex, where the
vertical maps are (−1)p times the coboundary maps, and the horizontal maps are induced
as in Čech cohomology from the inclusions ē(P ) ←֓ ē(P ′ ) for F ′ ⊇ F , with the alternating
sign convention of [B-T, (15.7.1)]. Exactly as in [B-T, (15.7)], we see that the q-th row
of X p,q is exact, except at the p = 0 position where the kernel equals C q (∂ X̄/Γ). Thus
the type I spectral sequence for X p,q collapses at E2 to H ∗ (∂ X̄/Γ). Therefore, the total
complex of X p,q computes H ∗ (∂ X̄/Γ).
          p,q
   Let Er,X   be the type II spectral sequence for X p,q . We have

                     p,q
                               M
(9.2.1)             E1,X =            H q (ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P )) ⇒ H p+q (∂ X̄/Γ).

(9.3). For 0 6 p 6 n − 2, define
                                         M
                              W p,q =            C q (WF /(Γ ∩ P )),

made into a double complex in the same way as X p,q . (Recall that WF ←֓ WF ′ whenever
                p,q
F ′ ⊇ F .) Let Er,W be the type II spectral sequence for W p,q . As above,

                              p,q
                                       M
(9.3.1)                      E1,W =            H q (WF /(Γ ∩ P )).
                                      F∈Φp+2


   Let W ∗ denote the single complex associated to W p,q . Thus the abutment of (9.3.1) is
H p+q (W ∗ ).
(9.4). We now define a map of double complexes. Consider the single-column double
complex                          q
                                 C (X̄/Γ)      if p = 0
                         Xˆ =
                           p,q
                                      0        if p > 0.

There is an obvious map Xˆ p,q → X p,q , where for p = 0 we map ω ∈ C q (X̄/Γ) to the direct
sum over F ∈ Φ2 of the restriction of ω to C q (ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P )).
Lemma. The map Xˆ p,q → X p,q is a chain map of double complexes.
Proof. Let ω ∈ C q (X̄/Γ), and let τ be its image in X 0,q . The only thing to check is that
the horizontal arrow δ : X 0,q → X 1,q carries τ to 0. But as we have said, the kernel of δ is
precisely the set of elements that come from a global cochain on ∂ X̄/Γ. And τ does come
from a global cochain, namely the restriction of ω to ∂ X̄/Γ. 
  Considering the type I spectral sequences, we see that Xˆ p,q → X p,q induces on the
abutments the canonical restriction map H q (X̄/Γ) → H q (∂ X̄/Γ).
  Next, consider                     q
                              p,q    C (W/Γ)       if p = 0
                           Ŵ =
                                         0         if p > 0,

made into a double complex the same way Xˆ was. There is an obvious map ψ : Ŵ p,q →
W p,q carrying ω ∈ C q (W/Γ) to the direct sum over F ∈ Φ2 of the restrictions of ω to
C q (WF /(Γ ∩ P )). Again, ψ : Ŵ p,q → W p,q is a chain map of double complexes.
(9.5). We now give the main result of the paper.

  (ii) There is a spectral sequence

                                 M

                               F∈Φp+2


and ψ induces a map of spectral sequences given on the E1 page by the natural restriction
                  0,q
map H q (W/Γ) → E1,W  .

Here X is as in (1.5), Γ is any arithmetic subgroup of Γ0 as in (2.2), Φl is as in (9.2), and
P is the R-points of the parabolic Q-subgroup associated to F as in (3.2). The space WF ,
a closed subcomplex of the well-rounded retract W , is defined in (6.1). We use any fixed
abelian group of coefficients.
Proof. First we observe that the global deformation retraction r̄ : X̄ → W induces a map
of double complexes X p,q → W p,q . The map r̄ commutes with the vertical maps of these
double complexes, because any continuous map commutes with the coboundary maps in
singular cohomology. More importantly, r̄ commutes with the horizontal maps because it
is defined globally on X̄, and because the horizontal maps are induced from inclusion maps
on various subspaces of X̄.
                                                                              p,q     p,q
    It follows that r̄ induces a homomorphism of spectral sequences Er,X          → Er,W   . The
                                              q                      q
map on E1 terms comes from the maps H (ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P )) → H (WF /(Γ ∩ P )) induced for
all F by r̄. By Theorem 8.5, the latter maps are canonical isomorphisms. By [Br, VII.2.6],
the right-hand arrow in (i) is an isomorphism.
    Similarly, r̄ induces a map X̂ p,q → Ŵ p,q . By Corollary 8.4, it gives a canonical isomor-
phism in cohomology. This is the left vertical arrow in (i).
    Part (9.4) defined the maps of double complexes that induce the horizontal arrows in (i),
and it explained why the top arrow is the canonical restriction. This proves (i).
    The spectral sequence in (ii) is (9.3.1). The assertion about ψ in (ii) is immediate from
the definition of ψ. 

             Section 10—Practical Comments and Related Results
(10.1). We make some remarks about how to use the spectral sequence (9.5.1) in practice.
When we work with the finite cell complex W/Γ, we represent each cell by some piece of
data. (See (10.6), [M-M0], or [A-G-G].) Since WF is a subcomplex of W , it is tempting to
imagine representing each cell of WF /(Γ ∩ P ) by some piece of the W/Γ data. However,
two cells of WF may be equivalent mod Γ and yet inequivalent mod (Γ ∩ P ). An example
when Γ = GL3 (Z), F = {0 ⊆ (∗, ∗, 0) ⊆ Q3 }, is provided by the two 0-cells of W whose
minimal vectors are given by the columns of the following matrices (together with their
negatives):
                                                                        
                 1 0      1 0 0       −1               1    0 0 1      1 0
                0 1      1 0 1        0      and    0    1 0 0      1 1.
                 0 0      0 1 1        1               0    0 1 1      1 1
24                          AVNER ASH AND MARK MCCONNELL

The cells are Γ-equivalent. (In the language of [M-M0], their C-configurations are both
complete quadrilaterals.) But any element of Γ preserving F must carry the left-hand
matrix to a matrix with three 0’s in its bottom row.
   In general, each Γ-class of cells of WF will break up into finitely many (Γ ∩ P )-classes.
So a cell in WF /(Γ ∩ P ) is represented by a piece of data for W/Γ, plus a finite amount
of extra structure depending on F . Say one has worked out all the classes in (9.5.1)
as explicit cocycles on the cell complexes WF /(Γ ∩ P ). To compute the d1 and higher
differentials, one has to work out how the data-with-extra-structure in WF /(Γ ∩ P ) is
connected with the data-with-extra-structure in WF ′ /(Γ ∩ P ) for F ′ ⊇ F . Sheafhom, a
suite of object-oriented programs currently under development by the second author, may
help to automate such computations.
   Say that Γ is small enough if, whenever F , F ′ are distinct Q-flags and WF ∩ WF ′ 6= ∅,
there is no element of Γ carrying F to F ′ . When Γ is small enough in this sense, we need
never worry about the extra structure just described. To see why, assume there were two
cells Ca , Cb ∈ WF which were not (Γ ∩ P )-equivalent but such that Cb = γ · Ca for some
γ ∈ Γ. Set F ′ = γ −1 F ; we have F ′ 6= F since γ ∈/ P . Because Cb respects F , Ca must
            ′
respect F . Hence Ca ∈ WF ∩ WF ′ . Since Γ was assumed small enough, the existence of
such a γ is a contradiction.
   When k = Q and n 6 4, one can use the methods of [M1] to show that the principal
congruence subgroups Γ(N ) ⊂ GLn (Z) of prime level N > 3 are small enough in the above
sense. We do not know whether all neat Γ are small enough.

(10.2). For convenience, we record the homology version of our main theorem. We use
the obvious analogues of the notation of (9.5).

(10.3). Consider one Borel-Serre boundary face ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P ). As we mentioned in
the introduction, our methods allow us to compute the canonical maps H ∗ (X̄/Γ) →
H ∗ (ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P )) and H∗ (ē(P )/(Γ ∩ P )) → H∗ (X̄/Γ) without any spectral sequences.
We simply use the cellular map WF /(Γ ∩ P ) → W/Γ.
   In the application to GL4 (Z) described near the end of (0.2), we are primarily inter-
ested in the degree-five homology. We believe that in degree five, all the homology of the
boundary comes from the maximal boundary faces. We could therefore find the image of
                                                      
                            M                           
                                       H5 (WF /(Γ ∩ P )) → H5 (W/Γ)
                        F for maximal
                         faces mod Γ


without computing any spectral sequences.
   It would very interesting to find the image of the map H∗ (∂ X̄/Γ) → H∗ (X̄/Γ) without
having to find H∗ (∂ X̄/Γ) directly, and without having to work out any spectral sequences.
(10.4). All our results hold for Γ-equivariant cohomology. That is, one may replace
H ∗ ((. . . )/Γ) with HΓ∗ ((. . . )) in the theorems of Section 9 and throughout the paper. Of
course, if we use coefficients in a field of characteristic 0 or of characteristic prime to
the order of any torsion element of Γ, then the two kinds of cohomology are canonically
isomorphic. All these results hold for homology.
    In the Γ-equivariant setting, the summands in each column of our spectral sequences
                              ∗
would be replaced by H(Γ∩P           ) (WF ), and each of these would have to be computed by a
spectral sequence in its own right. We would get a spectral sequence of spectral sequences.
    Both HΓ∗ (X) and H ∗ (X/Γ) are interesting objects from the point of view of number
theory and automorphic forms. Both have Hecke operators acting on them. In [A4], the
first author has conjectured that any Hecke eigenclass in HΓ∗ (X; Fp ), for any p, should have
an attached mod p representation of the absolute Galois group of Q. In [A-M2], we have
conjectured the same for the Hecke module H ∗ (X/Γ; Fp ). Both papers provide examples.
(10.5). The method of this paper can easily be extended to SLn . If G were SLn (S), then
K\G would be the product of the irreducible symmetric spaces for the SLn (kv ). In the
case G = GLn (S) of this paper,
                            Q HK\G     is the product of the SLn (kv ) symmetric spaces
                                   ∼
and a Euclidean factor H\ ( v R+ ) = R+r1 +r2 −1
                                                 , where r1 , r2 are the number of real and
complex places of k, respectively.
(10.6). Let k = Q, so that Γ ⊆ GLn (Z) or SLn (Z), and let n 6 4. In [M1] and the
survey article [M-M0], an interpretation of the cell structure on the well-rounded retract
W is given. There is a one-to-one correspondence in which each cell corresponds to a
configuration of points and lines (called a C-configuration) in the projective space Pn−1 (Q).
It is easy to interpret our WF in this language.
(10.7). Again let k = Q and n 6 4. Let X̆/Γ be any Satake compactification of X/Γ.
In [M2], one constructs a cell structure on X̆/Γ. Intersecting with X/Γ gives a “locally-
compact cell structure” on X/Γ that is dual to the well-rounded retract W/Γ inside X/Γ

(see [M1, §2] for definitions and precise statements). There is a cellular map from the
barycentric subdivision of the boundary of X̆/Γ to the barycentric subdivision of W/Γ.
This offers an interesting contrast to the present paper.
