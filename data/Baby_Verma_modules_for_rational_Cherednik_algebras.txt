                                                       Abstract. In this paper, we introduce baby Verma modules for symplectic reflection algebras
                                                       of complex reflection groups at parameter t = 0 (the so–called rational Cherednik algebras at
                                                       parameter t = 0) and present their most basic properties. As an example, we use baby Verma
                                                       modules to answer several problems posed by Etingof and Ginzburg, [5], and give an elementary
                                                       proof of a theorem of Finkelberg and Ginzburg, [6].




                                                                                            1. Introduction

                                             1.1.    Symplectic reflection algebras algebras of complex reflection groups (the so–called rational
                                             Cherednik algebras) arise in many different mathematical disciplines: integrable systems, Lie the-
                                             ory, representation theory, differential operators, symplectic geometry. Early on a dichotomy (de-
                                             pending on a single parameter t) appears in the behaviour of these algebras: when t 6= 0 the
                                             algebras are rather non–commutative and relations with differential operators come to the fore;
                                             when t = 0 the algebras have very large centres and connections between the geometry of the
                                             centre and representation theory are of interest. This paper concentrates on the second case. We
                                             introduce a family of finite dimensional modules called baby Verma modules and present their most
                                             basic properties. By analogy with the representation theory of reductive Lie algebras in positive
                                             characteristic, we believe these modules are fundamental to the understanding of the representation
                                             theory and associated geometry of the rational Cherednik algebras at parameter t = 0.

                                             1.2.    Let W be a complex reflection group and h its reflection representation over C. The rational
                                             Cherednik algebras introduced by Etingof and Ginzburg, [5], are deformations of the skew–group
                                             ring C[h ⊕ h∗ ] ∗ W depending on parameters t and c. We denote them by Ht,c . It can be shown
                                             that when t = 0 there is an embedding of C[h∗ ]W ⊗ C[h]W into Zc , the centre of H0,c , and thus a
                                             map
                                                                                     Υ : Spec(Zc ) −→ h∗ /W × h/W.
                                             The baby Verma modules are H0,c –modules naturally associated to points in the (reduced) zero
                                             fibre, Υ−1 (0). Studying their properties allows us to deduce some properties of Zc and of the map
                                             Υ. We prove the following results:
                                                   • There is a surjective map, Θ, from the isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of
                                                     W over C to the elements in the fibre Υ−1 (0) .
                                                   • The map Θ is an isomorphism if and only if the points of Υ−1 (0) are smooth in Spec(Zc ).

                                               .
                                                                                                       1
2                                            IAIN GORDON

    • If Θ is an isomorphism and S a simple W –module, then the component of the scheme theoretic
       fibre Υ∗ (0) corresponding to Θ(S) has a C∗ –action whose associated Poincaré polynomial is
       explicitly described. The component has, in particular, dimension dim(S)2 .
    • The variety Spec(Zc ) is singular for W a finite Coxeter group of type D2n , E, F, H and I2 (m)
       (n ≥ 2, m ≥ 5).
These results are related to problems of Etingof and Ginzburg, confirming [5, Conjecture 17.14],
answering [5, Question 17.15] and partially answering [5, Question 17.1].

1.3.   The final result above should be compared to recent results on the non–existence of a crepant
resolution for the orbit space (h∗ × h)/W . It is shown in [13] that the orbit space admits no crepant
resolution if W is the Coxeter group of type G2 ; folding arguments then imply no such resolution
for W of type D and E. It is an interesting problem to make the relationship between resolutions
and deformations of (h × h∗ )/W precise.

1.4.   Recall Calogero–Moser phase space defined by

         CMn = {(X, Y ) ∈ Matn (C) × Matn (C) : [X, Y ] + Id = rank 1 matrix}//P GLn (C).

In the particular case of W = Sn , the symmetric group on n letters, it is known that for c 6= 0 there
is an isomorphism between Spec(Zc ) and CMn under which the map Υ corresponds to sending the
pair of matrices (X, Y ) to their eigenvalues. Since it is known that CMn is smooth, our results
mentioned in 1.2 associate to each point in Υ−1 (0) a partition of n, as in [19]. Let λ ⊢ n. We prove:
    • The Poincaré polynomial of the component of the scheme–theoretic fibre Υ∗ (0) corresponding
       to λ is Kλ (t)Kλ (t−1 ), where Kλ is the Kostka polynomial corresponding to λ.
    • For the point Mλ ∈ Υ−1 (0) corresponding to λ, there is a relationship between the finite
       dimensional algebra H0,c /Mλ H0,c and Springer theory for the nilpotent orbit in Matn (C) with
       Jordan normal form of type λ.
These results confirm a pair of conjectures of Etingof and Ginzburg, [5, Conjectures 17.12 and
17.13], and give an elementary proof of a recent theorem of Finkelberg and Ginzburg, [6]. As noted
later, the extension of the first result to Γ ≀ Sn , the wreath product of a finite subgroup of SL2 (C)
by the symmetric group, is straightforward.

1.5.   The paper is organised as follows. Sections 2–3 introduce notation and present the embedding
of C[h∗ ]W ⊗ C[h]W into Zc . In Section 4 we define and study baby Verma modules. Section 5 sees
the proofs of all but the last result stated in 1.2, whilst Section 6 deals with the special case of the
symmetric group, Sn . In Section 7 we prove the final result of 1.2 and present a couple of basic
open problems.

                                              2. Notation

2.1.   Let W be a complex reflection group and h its reflection representation over C. Let S denote
the set of complex reflections in W . Let ω be the canonical symplectic form on V = h ⊕ h∗ . For
s ∈ S, let ωs be the skew–symmetric form which coincides with ω on im(idV −s) and has ker(idV −s)
as the radical. Let c : S −→ C be a W –invariant function sending s to cs . The rational Cherednik
algebra at parameter t = 0 (depending on c) is the quotient of the skew group algebra of the tensor
algebra on V , T V ∗ CW , by the relations
                                                     X
                                          [x, y] =         cs ωs (x, y)s
                                                     s∈S

for all y ∈ h∗ and x ∈ h. This algebra is denoted by Hc .

2.2.   We will denote a set of representatives of the isomorphism classes of simple W –modules by
Λ.

2.3.   Let R = ⊕Ri be a finite dimensional Z-graded C–algebra. We will let R − mod (R − modZ )
denote the category of finite dimensional (graded) left R–modules. Given an object M in R−modZ ,
let M [i] denote the ith shift of M , defined by M [i]j = Mj−i . The graded endomorphism ring of M
is defined as
                                              M
                                 End(M ) =           HomR−modZ (M, M [i]).
                                              i∈Z

Given N , a Z–graded right R–module, the graded dual N ⊛ is the object of R − modZ defined by

                          (N ⊛)i = {f : N −→ C : f (Nj ) = 0 for all j 6= −i}.

The forgetful functor is denoted F : R − modZ −→ R − mod.

                                         3. The centre of Hc

3.1.   Throughout Zc = Z(Hc ) and A = C[h∗ ]W ⊗ C[h]W . Thanks to [5, Proposition 4.15], A ⊂ Zc
for any finite complex reflection group W and any parameter c. We will give an elementary proof
of this inclusion.

3.2.   Let s ∈ S. There exists αs ∈ h such that h = hs ⊕ Cαs , where hs = {h ∈ h : s(h) = h} and
s(αs ) = e2πins αs for some rational number 0 < ns < 1. Similarly, we have α∨            ∗
                                                                            s , −ns and hs . We
don’t choose to normalise αs and α∨
                                  s , but note that for all h ∈ hs it follows from

                                    α∨        ∨
                                     s (h) = αs (s(h)) = e
                                                          2πins ∨
                                                               αs (h)

that α∨                            ∗
      s (hs ) = 0. Similarly, αs (hs ) = 0.

3.3.   For any reflection s ∈ W , an explicit calculation shows, for y ∈ h∗ and x ∈ h

                                                        αs (y)α∨
                                                               s (x)
                                        ωs (x, y) =         ∨
                                                                     .
                                                          αs (αs )
The principal commutation relation for Hc is
                                                 X          αs (y)α∨
                                                                   s (x)
                                      [x, y] =         cs       ∨
                                                                         s.                      (1)
                                                              αs (αs )

3.4.   Let s be a reflection in W and set λs = 1 − e2πins ∈ C. For h ∈ h
                                                             α∨s (h)
                                        s(h) = h − λs         ∨
                                                                      αs .
                                                             αs (αs )

This action extends multiplicatively to C[h∗ ].

3.5.   The functional α∨                                                  ∗               ∨
                       s extends inductively to a C–linear operator on C[h ] as follows: αs |C ≡ 0
and for p, p′ ∈ C[h∗ ],

                                                                      α∨      ∨ ′
                                                                       s (p)αs (p )
                           α∨    ′     ∨     ′    ∨ ′
                            s (pp ) = αs (p)p + pαs (p ) − λs             ∨
                                                                                    αs .         (2)
                                                                         αs (αs )

Define a graded operator on C[h∗ ] by

                                                             α∨s (p)
                                        s̃(p) = p − λs        ∨
                                                                      αs .                       (3)
                                                             αs (αs )
An inductive calculation proves that

                                 the operators s and s̃ agree on C[h∗ ].                         (4)

In particular,

                     p ∈ C[h∗ ]W if and only if α∨
                                                 s (p) = 0 for all reflections s ∈ W.            (5)

3.6.   Let y ∈ h∗ and p ∈ C[h∗ ]. One proves inductively using (1), (2), (3) and (4) that
                                                 X          y(αs )α∨
                                                                   s (p)
                                      [p, y] =         cs      ∨
                                                                         s.
                                                  s

It follows from (5) that if p ∈ C[h∗ ]W then p ∈ Zc . Of course similar arguments apply to C[h]W , so
we have proved

Proposition. Let Hc be a Cherednik algebra. Then A ⊂ Zc .

We denote the corresponding morphism of varieties

                              Υ : Spec(Zc ) −→ Spec(A) = h∗ /W × h/W.                            (6)

(respectively y ∈ h∗ , w ∈ W ). The PBW theorem, [5, Theorem 1.3], shows that Hc has a (vector
space) triangular decomposition

                                Hc −−−→ C[h∗ ]coW ⊗ C[h]coW ⊗ CW,                                      (7)

where “coW ” stands for W –coinvariants, that is C[h∗ ]coW = C[h∗ ]/C[h∗ ]W    ∗
                                                                          + C[h ]. Thanks to Cheval-
ley’s Theorem these coinvariant rings are graded versions of the regular representation of W , so in
particular dim(Hc ) = |W |3 .

4.2.   Let Hc− = C[h]coW ∗ CW , a subalgebra of Hc . The algebra map Hc− −→ CW sending an
element q ∗ w to q(0)w, makes any W –module into an Hc− –module.
  Given S ∈ Λ, a simple W –module, we define M (S), a baby Verma module, by

                                           M (S) = Hc ⊗               S.
                                                                Hc−

By construction M (S) is an object of Hc − modZ .                     Equation (7) shows that dim(M (S)) =
|W | dim(S). Furthermore for T ∈ Λ, set
                                                X
                                     fT (t) =         (C[h∗ ]coW : T [i])ti .                          (8)
                                                i∈Z

The polynomials fT (t) are called the fake degrees of W and have the property fT (1) = dim T .
They have been calculated for all finite Coxeter groups. In the graded Grothendieck group of W ,
we have by construction
                                                      X
                                      [M (S)] =              fT (t)[T ⊗ S].                            (9)

4.3.   The following proposition gathers results from [12, Section 3]. Recall F : Hc − modZ −→
Hc − mod is the forgetful functor.

Proposition. Let S, T ∈ Λ.
  1. The baby Verma module M (S) has a simple head, denoted L(S).
  2. M (S) is isomorphic to M (T )[i] if and only if S and T are the same element of Λ and i = 0.
  3. {L(S)[i] : S ∈ Λ, i ∈ Z} gives a complete set of pairwise non–isomorphic simple graded Hc –
       modules.
  4. F (L(S)) is a simple Hc –module, and {F (L(S)) : S ∈ Λ} is a complete set of pairwise non–
       isomorphic simple Hc –modules.
  5. Let P (S) be the projective cover of L(S). Then F (P (S)) is the projective cover F (L(S)).

4.4.   Lemma.       Let S, T ∈ Λ and i be a positive integer. Then (M (S)[i] : L(T )) = 0 and
(M (S) : L(T )) = δS,T .

Proof. By construction the baby Verma module M (T ) is concentrated in non–negative degree and
generated by its degree zero component, 1 ⊗ T = M (T )0 . Since M (T ) is a homomorphic image of
P (T ), we can find T̃ , a W –submodule of P (T )0 isomorphic to T which maps onto M (T )0 . Since
P (T ) has a simple head, it follows that T̃ generates P (T ).
    If L(T ) is a composition factor of M (S)[i], there exists a non–zero graded homomorphism from
P (T ) to M (S)[i], sending P (T )0 to M (S)−i . As M (S)−i is zero for positive values of i, this proves
the first claim of the lemma. If i is zero, then T̃ maps to M (S)0 and the second claim follows.


4.5.   An object V in Hc − modZ is said to have an M -filtration if it has a filtration

                                 0 = V0 ⊆ V1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Vn−1 ⊆ Vn = V

such that for 1 ≤ j ≤ n, Vj /Vj−1 ∼
                                  = M (S)[i] for S a simple W –module and i ∈ Z. By [12, Corollary
4.3] the numbers

                              [V : M (S)[i]] = |{j : Vj /Vj−1 ∼
                                                              = M (S)[i]}|

are independent of the filtration used.


4.6.   Let Hc+ = C[h∗ ]coW ∗ CW . Given a simple W –module, we define

                                       M − (S) = (S ∗ ⊗H + Hc )⊛.
                                                           c


    It is shown in [12, Theorem 4.5] that for a simple W –module S, the projective cover P (S) has
an M -filtration such that for any i ∈ Z and simple W –module T

                                [P (S) : M (T )[i]] = (M − (T )[i] : L(S)).                         (10)


4.7.   For this paragraph only suppose that W is a finite Coxeter group. Then (10) can be improved
to the following Brauer–type reciprocity formula

                                 [P (S) : M (T )[i]] = (M (T )[i] : L(S)).                          (11)

This follows from an adaptation of [12, Theorem 5.1] with two special ingredients. Firstly, we
require the antiautomorphism, ω, of Hc which sends x ∈ h, respectively y ∈ h∗ , to the corresponding
element x̃ of h∗ , respectively ỹ of h, under the W –invariant form (−, −) on h and w to w−1 for
w ∈ W . Secondly, we must observe that any simple W –module is self–dual (since the characters of
W all take values in R).

                                       5. On the fibre Υ∗ (0)

5.1.   Recall the morphism Υ given in (6). We will study the scheme theoretic fibres Υ∗ (0) of
the point 0 ∈ h∗ /W × h/W . The closed points of these fibres, denoted Υ−1 (0), are precisely the
maximal ideals of Zc lying over A+ . Given such an ideal, M , the component of Υ∗ (0) corresponding
to M is defined to be Spec(OM ), where

                                       OM = (Zc )M /A+ (Zc )M .

The algebra OM inherits a Z–grading from Hc , seen as follows. The Z–grading on Hc corresponds to
an algebraic action of C∗ which preserves both Zc and A and makes Υ a C∗ -equivariant morphism.
Since 0 is the unique fixed point of h∗ /W × h/W , each fibre Υ∗ (0) inherits a C∗ –action, in other
words a Z–grading.

5.2.   Recall that a point M ∈ Spec(Zc ) is called Azumaya if and only if there is a unique simple Hc –
module annihilated by M and its dimension equals |W |. By [5, Theorem 1.7] the Azumaya points
are precisely the smooth points of Spec(Zc ) and any simple Hc –module lying over an Azumaya
point is isomorphic, as a W –module, to the regular representation of W .

5.3.   The algebra Hc of 4.1 splits into a direct sum of indecomposable algebras, the blocks, which
by [3, Corollary 2.7] are in one–to–one correspondence with the elements of Υ−1 (0)
                                                M
                                        Hc =          BM .
                                               M ∈Υ−1 (0)

If M is an Azumaya point of Spec(Zc ) there is an isomorphism

                                         BM ∼
                                            = Mat|W | (OM ),                                      (12)

by [3, Proposition 2.2].

5.4.   For any simple W –module S, the baby Verma module M (S) is a Z–graded indecomposable
Hc –module by Proposition 4.3(1), and so a non–trivial module for a unique block. This gives a
mapping

            Θ : {isomorphism classes of simple W –modules} −→ {elements of Υ−1 (0)}.              (13)

This mapping is surjective, since each simple Hc –module is a quotient of a baby Verma by Propo-
sition 4.3(3).

5.5.   Suppose that M ∈ Υ−1 (0) is smooth in Spec(Zc ). It follows from 5.2 and (12) that

                                         BM ∼
                                            = Mat|W | (OM ).

In particular, BM has a unique simple module, implying that M = Θ(S) for a unique element S of
Λ. Moreover, we have an isomorphism
                                               ∼
                                       OM −−−→ End(P (S)).
8                                                IAIN GORDON

The map is graded since it is given by multiplication by elements of OM . Thus we have a formula
for pS (t) ∈ Z[t, t−1 ], the Poincaré polynomial of OM ,
                                        X
                             pS (t) =       dim (HomR−modZ (P (S), P (S)[i])) ti
                                        i∈Z
                                    X
                                  =  (P (S)[i] : L(S))ti .
                                        i∈Z

Since the block BM has only the simple modules L(S)[i] (i ∈ Z) it follows from (10) that
                           X
                pS (t) =      [P (S)[i] : M (S)[j]](M (S)[j] : L(S))ti

                               X                                    X

                                i∈Z                                 i∈Z

5.6.   Recall the fake polynomials, fS (t), defined in (8). Let bS be the lowest power of t appearing
in fS (t).

Theorem. Suppose M ∈ Υ−1 (0) is smooth in Spec(Zc ). Then there exists a unique simple module
S ∈ Λ such that Θ(S) = M . Furthermore pS (t), the Poincaré polynomial of OM , is given by

                                       pS (t) = tbS ∗ −bS fS (t)fS ∗ (t−1 ).

Proof. Following 5.5, it remains to prove the formula for the Poincaré polynomial pS (t). By 5.2
L(S) is isomorphic to the regular representation of W and L(S) is the only possible composition
factor of P (S). We begin by determining the unique integer lS for which (L(S)lS : 1) 6= 0, where 1
denotes the trivial W –module. Let j be the smallest integer such that (M (S)j : 1) 6= 0. Since L(S)
is a homomorphic image of M (S), j ≤ lS . If j < lS then necessarily (M (S)[lS − j] : L(S)) 6= 0,
contradicting Lemma 4.4. Hence j = lS .
    If T is a simple W –module, 1 is a summand of T ⊗ S if and only if T ∼
                                                                         = S ∗ . Hence, by (9),
                                     X
                                         (M (S)k : 1)tk = fS ∗ (t).
                                        i∈Z

Thus lS equals bS ∗ , the lowest power of t appearing in fS ∗ (t). Moreover, for each copy of 1 in
M (S)k there occurs a corresponding copy of L(S)[k − bS ∗ ] in M (S), yielding
               X                        X
                  (M (S)[i] : L(S))ti =   (M (S) : L(S)[−i])(t−1 )i = tbS ∗ fS ∗ (t−1 ).
                 i∈Z                          i∈Z

A similar argument shows that
                             X
                              (M − (S)[i] : L(S))t−i = t−bS fS (t).
                                 i∈Z

The result follows.

5.7.    We remark that the statement of Theorem 5.6 simplifies if W is a finite Coxeter group. As
observed in 4.7 every simple W –module is self–dual, so the Poincaré polynomial above becomes

                                                     pS (t) = fS (t)fS (t−1 ).

5.8.    On specialising t to 1 and recalling that fS (1) = dim S, we obtain the following corollary,
which generalises [5, Proposition 4.16], solves [5, Problem 17.15] and incidentally confirms [5,
Conjecture 17.14].

Corollary. Suppose Υ−1 (0) consists of smooth points in Spec(Zc ). Then Θ : Λ −→ Υ−1 (0) is a
bijection such that the scheme theoretic multiplicity of Υ−1 (0) at the point Θ(S) is dim(S)2 .

                                            6. The symmetric group case

6.1.    Throughout this section W will be the symmetric group Sn and Hc will be the Cherednik
algebra of W with non–zero parameter c. This choice of c ensures that Spec(Zc ) is smooth, [5,
Corollary 16.2].

6.2.    We recall notation and several basic facts on the representation theory of Sn over C. The
simple Sn –modules are indexed by partitions of n, which we will write as λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . ). For such
a partition λ ⊢ n, we denote the simple module by Sλ . In particular S(n) = 1 and S(1n ) = sign, the
trivial and sign representation of Sn respectively. Given λ, a partition of n, we let λ′ ⊢ n denote
the transpose of λ. We have Sλ′ ∼ = S ′ , where, for any Sn –module V , we set V ′ = V ⊗ sign. The
                                                 λ
Young subgroup Sλ ≤ Sn is the row stabiliser of the Young tableau of shape λ, with the tableau
numbered in the order that one reads a book. As an abstract group it is isomorphic to the product
Q
  i Sλi .

6.3.    We recall two polynomials which arise in the theory of symmetric functions. The (two vari-
able) Kostka–Macdonald coefficients Kλµ (q, t) are the transition functions between the Macdonald
polynomials and Schur functions, see [14, VI.8]. The Kostka polynomials are defined as Kλµ (0, t).
In particular, we have
                                                                            Y
             Kλ (t) ≡ t−n(λ) Kλ(1n ) (0, t) = (1 − t) · · · (1 − tn )             (1 − thλ (u) )−1 ∈ Z[t, t−1 ],
                                                                            u∈λ

        n(λ′ )                    1)λ′i

where            =   i≥1 (i   −           and hλ (u) is the hook–length of u in λ.

6.4.    The first part of the following theorem recovers [6, Theorem 1.2].

Theorem. Let λ be a partition of n.
(1) The Poincaré polynomial of OΘ(Sλ ) is given by

                                                  pSλ (t) = Kλ (t)Kλ (t−1 ).

(2) The image of the simple Hc –module L(Sλ ) in the graded Grothendieck group of W is

of χλ on a conjugacy class with cycle type ρ.

By Lemma 4.4, the transition matrix between the baby Verma modules and the simple Hc –modules
is invertible in C[[t]], so it is enough to show that

By [14, p.82 and p.362] Kµ,(n) (t, t) = fSµ (t), proving that indeed (19) holds.

6.5.   In [6, Theorem 1.5] it is shown that an analogue of Theorem 6.4(1) holds for the wreath
product W = (Z/N Z) ≀ Sn . This result can be proved as above, using the fake degrees as described
in [18, (5.5)].

6.6. Springer theory. Before proving Theorem 6.7 we need to recall several results from Springer
theory. Conjugacy classes of nilpotent matrices in Matn (C) are classified by partitions of n thanks
to the Jordan normal form: for each partition λ ⊢ n, fix a representative of the corresponding
nilpotent conjugacy class, eλ . Let B be the flag variety of the Lie algebra Matn (C), consisting of all
Borel subalgebras of Matn (C), and let Bλ ⊆ B denote the Borel subalgebras containing eλ . (Note
that B = B(1n ) .) Let dλ = 2 dimC Bλ . Let H ∗ (Bλ , C) denote the singular cohomology of Bλ with
complex coefficients. The following theorem presents the results we will use.

Theorem. For λ ⊢ n and i ∈ N, there is an action of Sn on H i (Bλ , C) enjoying the following
properties.
  1. There is a Sn –equivariant isomorphism of algebras C[h∗ ]coSn ∼ = H ∗ (B, C) doubling degree.
  2. The simple module Sλ is not a component of H i (B, C) for i < dλ .
  3. As an Sn –module, H dλ (Bλ , C) ∼
                                     = Sλ , whilst for odd i or i > dλ H i (Bλ , C) = 0.
  4. As an Sn –module, H ∗ (Bλ , C) ∼
                                    = IndSn
                                         Sλ 1.
  5. The inclusion Bλ ⊆ B induces a surjective Sn –equivariant graded algebra homomorphism

                                       πλ : H ∗ (B, C) −→ H ∗ (Bλ , C).

  6. Under the C[h∗ ]coW ∗ Sn –module structure induced by πλ , H ∗ (Bλ , C) has socle Sλ .

Proof. For (1)–(5) see [16],[17],[11] and [4].
  (6) Define a partial order on monomials in C[x1 , . . . , xn ] by declaring xi11 . . . xinn ≤ xj11 . . . xjnn if
and only if ik ≤ jk for all k = 1, . . . , n. By [8, Proposition 4.2], the algebra C[h∗ ]coW / ker πλ has
a basis B(λ) consisting of (the images of) monomials of C[h∗ ] = C[x1 , . . . , xn ] with the following
property: the elements of B(λ) are the monomials which are smaller in the above partial order
than the monomials in B(λ) of degree dλ . We see therefore that the socle of H ∗ (Bλ , C) as a
C[h∗ ]coW –module is concentrated in degree dλ . The result follows from (3).

In this situation, the Springer correspondence is simply the association of the nilpotent class
parametrised by λ to the simple Sn –module Sλ ∼
                                              = H dλ (Bλ , C).

6.7.    Let Mλ = Θ(Sλ ) ∈ Υ−1 (0). By 5.2 we have an isomorphism
                                            Hc
                                      ψ:         −→ EndC (L(Sλ ))                                    (20)
                                           Mλ Hc
defined by the action of Hc on L(Sλ ). Let e, e− ∈ CSn ∼    = L(Sλ ) denote the trivial and sign
                                                ′
idempotents respectively. Fix ǫλ (respectively ǫλ ), a base vector in the one–dimensional space
e(Hc /Mλ Hc )e− (respectively e− (Hc /Mλ Hc )e). The subalgebras C[h∗ ], C[h] ⊂ Hc generate two
subspaces C[h∗ ] · ǫλ , ǫλ · C[h] ⊂ Hc /Mλ Hc which are invariant under the left, respectively right
Sn -action on Hc /Mλ Hc by multiplication.
     The following theorem confirms [5, Conjecture 17.12].

Theorem. In the above notation there are Sn –module isomorphisms

                         C[h∗ ] · ǫλ ∼
                                     = IndSn
                                          Sλ′ 1      ,      ǫλ · C[h] ∼
                                                                      = IndSn
                                                                           Sλ sign.

In particular, these two Sn –modules have a single non–zero irreducible component in common: it
is isomorphic to Sλ′ .

Proof. Throughout the proof let R = C[h∗ ]coSn . Let N = 1/2n(n − 1) = d(1n ) . By Theorem 6.6
Rj = 0 if j > N and RN is the sign representation. Let 0 6= s ∈ RN . Recall that given V , a
Sn –module, we set V ′ = V ⊗ sign.
     Under the isomorphism ψ of (20), the elements e and e− correspond to projection onto the
trivial and sign components of L(Sλ ) respectively. Thus ǫλ (respectively ǫ′λ ) is the unique (up to
scalars) transformation which sends the sign (respectively trivial) component of L(Sλ ) to the trivial
(respectively sign) component of L(Sλ ) and is zero on all other isotypic components. As a left Sn –
module therefore, C[h∗ ] · ǫλ (respectively C[h∗ ] · ǫ′λ ) corresponds to the subspace X = R · tλ ⊆ L(Sλ )
(respectively Y = R · sλ ) where tλ (respectively sλ ) is a base vector for the trivial (respectively
sign) representation in L(Sλ ).
     By [5, Theorem 1.7(ii)], Hc and Zc are Morita equivalent, so in particular their injective dimen-
sions both equal dim Spec(Zc ) = 2(n − 1). Since H c is obtained from Hc by factoring out a regular
sequence in Zc of length 2(n − 1) it follows that the injective dimension of H c is 0. It follows
that the projective cover P (Sλ ), and thus M (Sλ ), has socle L(Sλ ). Therefore tλ (respectively sλ )
belongs to the tensor product Sλ ⊗ Sλ ⊂ L(Sλ ) ⊆ M (Sλ ) (respectively Sλ′ ⊗ Sλ ⊂ L(Sλ ) ⊆ M (Sλ ))
where the first tensorand is the highest degree component of R isomorphic to Sλ (respectively Sλ′ ).
To be explicit, let {vi } be a basis of Sλ and let {fi } (respectively {gi }) be the corresponding basis
for the copy of Sλ (respectively Sλ′ ) in the highest possible degree of R. We take
                              X                                  X
                        tλ =      fi ⊗ vi     (respectively sλ =     gi ⊗ vi ).
                                  i                                    i

     Consider the map

                    τ : R −→ X = R · tλ ,         (respectively τ ′ : R′ −→ Y = r · sλ , )
                          BABY VERMA MODULES FOR RATIONAL CHEREDNIK ALGEBRAS                             13

sending p to p · tλ (respectively p ⊗ 1 to p · sλ ). Since tλ ∈ 1 (respectively sλ ∈ sign), τ (respectively
τ ′ ) is a Sn –equivariant surjective homomorphism.
  We prove first that τ (respectively τ ′ ) factors through πλ′ : H ∗ (B, C) −→ H ∗ (Bλ′ , C) (respectively
πλ ⊗ id : H ∗ (B, C)′ −→ H ∗ (Bλ , C)′ ). Recall the non–degenerate form

                                           (−, −) : R × R −→ C,

defined by setting (p, q) equal to the coefficient of pq in RN with respect to s. The form pairs
Ri with RN −i and, since (wr, ws) = sign(w)(r, s), a representation V with V ′ . Let p ∈ ker πλ′
(respectively q ∈ ker πλ ). Observe that since πλ′ (Rp) = 0 (respectively πλ (Rq) = 0) the intersection
of Rp (respectively Rq) with the Sλ′ –component of H dλ′ (B, C) (respectively the Sλ –component of
H dλ (B, C)) is zero, by Parts (3) and (5) of Theorem 6.6. Thus (R, pfi ) = (Rp, fi ) = 0 (respectively
(R, qgi ) = (Rq, gi ) = 0) for all i . This confirms that τ (respectively τ ′ ) factors through πλ′
(respectively πλ ).
  We have an induced R ∗ Sn –homomorphism

                      σ : H ∗ (Bλ′ , C) −→ X,    (respectively σ ′ : H ∗ (Bλ , C)′ −→ Y ).

  Thanks to the non–degeneracy of the form (−, −), we can find fi′ ∈ R such that fi′ fj = δij s ∈ RN .
Then, for any i, f ′ · tλ = s ⊗ si ∈ X. Taking the span over all i shows that Sλ′ ∼
                      i                                                           = RN ⊗ Sλ ⊆ X.
It follows from Parts (2) and (6) of Theorem 6.6 that the socle of H ∗ (Bλ′ , C) does not lie in the
kernel of σ, and so σ is injective. By Part (4) of Theorem 6.6 we deduce that

                                  IndS     ∼ ∗           ∼ ∼      ∗
                                     Sλ′ 1 = H (Bλ′ , C) = X = C[h ] · ǫλ .
                                      n




  Arguing as in the above paragraph we see that

                                 IndS       ∼ ∗         ′ ∼  ∼    ∗     ′
                                    Sλ sign = H (Bλ , C) = Y = C[h ] · ǫλ .
                                     n




Let ω be the antiautomorphism of Hc discussed in 4.7. Since ω(Mλ ) annihilates L(Sλ∗ ) ∼ = L(Sλ )
there is an induced antiautomorphism on Hc /Mλ Hc . Under this antiautomorphism C[h∗ ] · ǫ′λ is sent
to ǫλ · C[h]. Since all Sn –modules are self–dual, we deduce that

                                           ǫλ · C[h] ∼
                                                     = IndSn
                                                          Sλ sign.


  The final sentence of the theorem is a restatement of Young’s construction of the irreducible
representations of Sn , [10, Corollary 4.16].


6.8.   We end this section by associating Theorem 6.7 to similar results found in the study of
principal nilpotent pairs.

6.9.    By [5, Theorem 11.16], there is an isomorphism of varieties

                                          Spec Zc −→ CMn ,

where CMn denotes the Calogero–Moser space {(X, Y ) ∈ Matn (C) × Matn (C) : [X, Y ] + Id =
rank 1 matrix}//P GLn (C). Under this isomorphism, the morphism Υ : Spec Zc −→ h∗ /W × h/W
corresponds to the morphism sending the matrices (X, Y ) to the pair of n–tuples consisting of their
eigenvalues. An explicit description of the bijection between the partitions of n and the elements
of CMn in Υ−1 (0) is given in [19, Section 6].

6.10.    Let Hilbn (C2 ) be the Hilbert scheme of n points in the plane, whose points are codimension n
ideals in C[X, Y ], see [15] for details. The Chow morphism Hilbn (C2 ) −→ (h∗ ⊕ h)/W = Symn (C2 )
sends such an ideal to its support (counted with multiplicity). There is a C∗ × C∗ –action on
Hilbn (C2 ) induced from the Z2 –grading on C[X, Y ] where X (respectively Y ) is homogeneous of
degree (1, 1) (respectively (1, −1)). The C∗ × C∗ –fixed points on Hilbn (C2 ) are in bijection with
the partitions of n: on the ideal corresponding to the fixed point of type λ, multiplication by X
(respectively Y ) yields a nilpotent transformation with Jordan form of type λ (respectively λ′ ). It
follows that these fixed points correspond to conjugacy classes of principal nilpotent pairs in sln (C),
[10, Section 5].

6.11.    Nakajima’s quiver varieties relate Calogero–Moser space and the Hilbert scheme. There
is a geometric family (CMn )t over C whose generic fibre (CMn )t for t 6= 0 is CMn and whose
degenerate point at t = 0 is Hilbn (C2 ), [15, Section 3.2]. This family admits a C∗ × C∗ –action,
which agrees with the above C∗ × C∗ –action on Hilbn (C2 ) when t = 0. For t 6= 0, the diagonal
C∗ –action dilates t and the anti–diagonal action corresponds to the C∗ –action on Zc considered in
4.1. Fixing a partition λ ⊢ n, the anti–diagonal C∗ –fixed points corresponding to λ give a section
of the family (CM)t over C \ {0}. The closure of this section yields the C∗ × C∗ –fixed point of
Hilbn (C2 ) corresponding to λ and hence a representative (Xλ , Yλ ) in the conjugacy class of principal
nilpotent pairs of type λ of sln (C). The Springer correspondence associates to Xλ (respectively Yλ )
the simple module Sλ (respectively Sλ′ ), [10, Corollary 4.16]. This confirms (an amended form) of
[5, Conjecture 17.13].

                                             7. Remarks

7.1.    A basic problem in the representation theory of Hc is:
     Problem 1: Find the graded W –character of L(S) for all S ∈ Λ.
                                                                                            : T [i])q i [T ]. By
                                                                           P
This simply means finding the composition multiplicities in [L(S)] =         T ∈Λ (L(S)
Lemma 4.4 this is equivalent to the problem:
     Problem 1′ : For all S ∈ Λ find the polynomials mS,T (q) =                     : L(T )[i])q i .
                                                                  P
                                                                      T ∈Λ (M (S)

Obviously, to solve Problem 1′ we can work in the blocks of the algebra Hc . Thus an important
subproblem is to describe which simple modules lie in a given block:

  Problem 2: Determine the partition of simple W –modules yielding the blocks of Hc .
In the notation of (13) this corresponds to determining the fibres of Θ.
  In Section 4 we have solved Problems 1′ and 2 for simple W –modules, S, such that Θ(S) is a
smooth point of Spec(Zc ) and in Section 5 we explictly solved Problem 1.

7.2.   Problem 2 is closely related to the determination of which complex reflection groups have
Spec(Zc ) smooth for generic values of c. Thanks to Section 4, a point of M ∈ Υ−1 (0) is singular in
Spec(Zc ) if Θ−1 (M ) is not a singleton. The following lemma, due to Brown, proves the converse,
showing that an arbitrary point M ′ ∈ Spec(Zc ) is Azumaya if and only if there is a unique simple
Hc -module annihilated by M ′ . One might hope that if the points of Υ−1 (0) are all smooth then
Spec(Zc ) is smooth.

Lemma (K.A.Brown). Let m be a maximal ideal of Hc . Suppose there exists a unique maximal
ideal M of Hc with M ∩ Zc = m. Then m is an Azumaya point of Spec Zc .

Proof. Let H = Hc and Z = Zc . Since M is the unique maximal ideal of H lying over m we
can localise at M in H to obtain HM . Moreover H ⊆ HM since H is prime. Let e be the trivial
idempotent of CW , considered as an element of H. Since HM is a local ring, by [7, Theorem 1] there
exists a positive integer t such that HM e = P ⊕t , where P is the unique indecomposable projective
HM –module. But, by [5, Theorem 3.1] eHe ∼    = Z, so that eHM e ∼ = Zm. Thus EndHM (HM e) ∼ = Zm,
showing that t = 1. Since HM =   ∼P  ⊕n for some n we have

                                  HM ∼
                                     = EndHM (HM ) ∼
                                                   = Matn (Zm).

Therefore ZM and HM are Morita equivalent, and since HM has finite global dimension so too does
Zm. It follows that m is a smooth point of Spec Zc . The lemma follows from 5.2.

7.3.   The analysis of Section 4 does provide a list of new examples for which Spec(Zc ) is not smooth
at generic values of c. The following results generalises the dihedral case studied in [5, Section 16].

Proposition. Suppose W is a finite Coxeter group of type D2n (n ≥ 2), E, F , H or I2 (m)
(m ≥ 5). Then Zc , the centre of Hc , is singular for all values of c.

Proof. Suppose there exists a value c such that Zc is smooth. Thanks to Corollary 6.4(1) the
blocks of Hc are in bijective correspondence with the simple W –modules and by 5.2 each simple
Hc –module, L(S), is isomorphic to the regular representation of W . The proof of Theorem 5.6
shows that (M (S) : L(S)) equals the coefficient of q bS in the fake degree fS ∗ (q). Since Lemma 4.4
shows that (M (S) : L(S)) = 1 this coefficient is necessarily 1 for all fake degrees. But there fake
degrees for D2n , E7 and E8 which have coefficient 2, [9, Remark 5.6.7], [2].
  Let jS be the degree of fS ∗ (q), so that the trivial module appears in M (S)jS . Since L(S) is the
only composition factor of M (S) we thus find a bound on the dimension of L(S) given by

   dim L(S) ≤ dim(S) dim C[h∗ ]coW             ∗ coW              ∗ coW        ∗ coW
                                                                                      
                                 <bS + dim C[h ]>jS + min{dim C[h ]bS , dim C[h ]jS } .           (21)

Using [2] and [1] we can calculate the right hand side of (21) and hence show that there exists a
simple W –module S such that dim L(S) < |W | in types E6 , F4 , H3 , H4 and I2 (m) (m ≥ 5).
     For W the Coxeter group of type E6 (respectively F4 , H4 , I2 (m) for m ≥ 5) we take S to be the
unique 10–dimensional simple module (respectively the unique 12–dimensional simple module, the
representation labelled χ7 in [1], the reflection representation); the right hand side of (21) equals
49960 (respectively 1020, 8808, 8) which is less than the order of W .
     For W the Coxeter group of type H3 let S be the reflection representation, which has fake degree
fS (q) = q + q 5 + q 9 . In this case the right hand side of (21) equals 120, the order of the group
W . Let S ′ = S ⊗ ǫ be the tensor product of S with the sign representation. The fake degree of
S ′ is q (9+5+1) fs (q −1 ) = q 14 + q 10 + q 6 . Thus there are two copies of the sign representation in
M (S)>9 , one in degree 10, the other in degree 14. Hence we can subtract 1 from our estimate in
(21), showing that dim L(S) < 120 = |W |, as required.

There are a number of other complex reflection groups whose fake degrees have leading coefficient
greater than 1, so we can prove non–smoothness in greater generality. The techniques above do
not work for D2n+1 however.

7.4.     Type G2 is the smallest example of a Weyl group for which Zc is singular for generic values
of c. In this case, calculation shows that Υ−1 (0) has five elements, with D± , the pair of two
dimensional simple modules, being the only simple W –modules sent to the same element under Θ.
The polynomials of Problem 1′ are

                  mD+ ,D+ (q) = mD− ,D− (q) = 1 + q 4 ,     mD+ ,D− (q) = mD− ,D+ (q) = q + q 3 .
