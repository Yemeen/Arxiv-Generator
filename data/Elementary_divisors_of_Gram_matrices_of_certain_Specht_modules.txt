0       Introduction

0.1     Problem

Specht modules S λ are combinatorially defined ZSn -modules, indexed by partitions λ of n,
which yield a complete set of pairwise nonequivalent ordinary irreducible representations
of the symmetric group Sn after scalar extension to C. A Specht module S λ carries a
nondegenerate Sn -invariant bilinear form, inducing an embedding into its Z-linear dual,
S λ ✂ ✲ S λ,∗ . The problem is to determine the structure of the quotient
    ✄


                                                  S λ,∗ /S λ

as an abelian group. Reformulated, we ask for the elementary divisors of the Gram matrix
of this bilinear form on S λ , or, for short, for the elementary divisors of S λ .


0.2     Known Results

0.2.1     Simple modules

Let p be a prime. Denote by λ′ the transposed partition of λ. The number of elementary
divisors of S λ not divisible by p is either zero, or the dimension of a simple Fp Sn -module.
Theorem [5, 11.5]. Let DFλ p be the image of S λ ✲ S λ,∗ /pS λ,∗ . If λ is p-regular, that is,
λ′i − λ′i+1 < p for all i ≥ 1, then DFλ p is a simple Fp Sn -module. Up to isomorphism, all
simple Fp Sn -modules occur this way. If λ is p-singular, we have DFλ p = 0.
Allowing for DFλ p to denote the zero module if λ is not a p-regular partition turns out to
be a convenient convention.


0.2.2     Schaper’s formula

First of all, the product of the elementary divisors of S λ is known.
                                                                                                  3


Theorem [9, p. 224]. There is an explicit combinatorial formula for the determinant of
the Gram matrix of S λ .
More precisely, given a prime p, the quotient S λ,∗ /S λ is expressible as a linear combi-
nation of Specht modules in the Grothendieck group of ZSn -modules of finite length by
Schaper’s formula. Given a commutative ring A, we abbreviate SAλ := A ⊗Z S λ .
Theorem [28, p. 60], cf. [16, Cor. 5.33]. There are combinatorially determined integral
coefficients αµ such that


              [SZλ,∗  /SZλ(p) ] =         [SFλ p (i)] =       αµ [SFµp ] ∈ K0 (modf-Z(p) Sn ) ,
                                    X                     X
                  (p)
                                    i≥1                   µ



where SFλ p (i) denotes the ith piece of the Jantzen filtration of SFλ p .
Together with calculations of decomposition numbers due to James, Williams, To
Law, Benson, Müller et al. [2, 5, 10, 18, 19, 20, 30], Schaper’s formula represents
our principal tool.



0.2.3    Numerical results

There is an estimate for the first elementary divisor, found by James in the course of the
construction of the simple modules DFµ p .
Lemma [5, 10.4]. The product i≥1 (λ′i − λ′i+1 )! divides the first elementary divisor of S λ .
                                          Q

In turn, the first elementary divisor of S λ divides the product i≥1 (λ′i − λ′i+1 )!i .
                                                                 Q

                                                                             3
For instance, 3! divides the first elementary divisor 12 of S (2 ) , which in turn divides 3!2 .
The James factor i≥1 (λ′i − λ′i+1 )! will reappear constantly.
                   Q

                                                                                         ′
Numerically, the relation between the elementary divisors of S λ and S λ has been known.
Proposition [13, 6.2.10]. Let nλ := rkZ S λ , and let i ∈ [1, nλ ]. The product of the ith
                                                                          ′
elementary divisor of S λ and the (nλ + 1 − i)th elementary divisor of S λ yields n!/nλ .
                                                                   ′
In particular, the elementary divisors of S λ and S λ mutually determine each other. We
shall give a module version of this relation in terms of Jantzen subquotients (4.1).

Let n ≥ 1, let 0 ≤ m ≤ n/2 and let p be a prime. Since the decomposition numbers
    (n−m,m)
of SFp      are in {0, 1} by James’ formula, the Jantzen filtration may be calculated by
means of Schaper’s formula.

                        (n−m,m)
Jantzen filtration of SFp       are determined. In particular, the elementary divisors of
  (n−m,m)
S         are calculated.
Moreover, combining arguments of Plesken [25] and Wirsing [31], we show that if
                (n−m,m)
m ≥ 3, then SQ          does not contain a unimodular ZSn -lattice, that is, a lattice X
                   ∗
satisfying X ≃ X (2.13). For m ∈ {1, 2}, unimodular lattices do occur and have been
classified by Plesken [25, p. 98 and II.5].


0.3.2   At a large prime

Suppose given a partition λ of n and a prime p > n − λ1 . Using the theorem of Carter
and Payne [3, p. 425], the direction of the Carter conjecture proven by James and
Murphy [9, p. 222], as well as Kleshchev’s modular branching rule [11, 0.6], the
Jantzen filtration of SFλ p may be calculated.
Theorem (3.5). If p does not divide a first row hook length in the range [1, λ2 ], then
SFλ p is simple. If p divides the first row hook length ht of the node (1, t), t ∈ [1, λ2],
                            λ[t]
then [SFλ p ] = [DFλ p ] + [DFp ], where λ[t] is the partition arising from λ by the according
                                             λ[t]
Carter-Payne box shift. The constituent [DFp ] lies in the vp (ht )th Jantzen subquotient.


0.3.3   Explicit diagonalization

The results mentioned so far are based on Schaper’s formula, so that no diagonalizing
bases can be deduced. In general, an explicit diagonalization seems to be complicated. For
hook partitions, however, it is easier to diagonalize directly (5.5) than to apply Schaper’s
formula, as has already been remarked by James and Mathas [unpublished].
                  2   n−4
Moreover, for S (2 ,1 ) , we give bases essentially diagonalizing the Gram matrix (5.14).
In general, it might be worthwhile to employ modular morphisms in order to fully solve
the diagonalization problem (cf. 6.8). But note that from such a complete solution, bases
for the simple Fp Sn -modules would ensue.


0.3.4   The scope of Schaper’s formula

Some three- and four-part partitions are treated in section 2.5, partly conjecturally. The
problem that remains to be solved, once all decomposition numbers and Jantzen subquo-

tients are known, is the following.
Let p be a prime, let eµ be a primitive idempotent of Z(p) Sn belonging to DFµ p and let
ελ be the central-primitive idempotent of QSn belonging to SQλ
                                                               . The investigation of the

elementary divisors of S       S can be reduced to the consideration of

                                          SZλ(p) eµ ✂ ✲ SZλ,∗  eµ .

                                                           (p)



This is a ελ eµ Z(p) Sn eµ -linear map, the determinant of which can be deduced from Schaper’s
formula. So we are led to consider the Z(p) -order ελ eµ Z(p) Sn eµ , which is of rank [SFλ p : DFµ p ]2
over Z(p) .
In particular, if [SFλ p : DFµ p ] = 1, we obtain ελ eµ Z(p) Sn eµ ≃ Z(p) , which enables us to
calculate elementary divisors. If [SFλ p : DFµ p ] > 1, however, Schaper’s formula alone is too
coarse.
In another disguise, concerning the distribution of the multiplicity of a simple module DFµ p
over the Jantzen subquotients, Schaper’s formula gives the value of a certain sum of which
one needs to know the summands (cf. 1.5 iii). If [SFλ p : DFµ p ] = 1, then this sum consists of
a single nonzero summand, that is, the Jantzen subquotient DFµ p appears in is determined.
But this purely numerical point of view hides the role of the ring ελ eµ Z(p) Sn eµ in case
[SFλ p : DFµ p ] > 1.

1        General considerations

1.1       Situation

1.1.1      An order Λ

Let R be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal generated by π, let K be its field
of fractions. Given an R-module M, we denote its reduction by M̄ := M/πM.
Let A be a simple K-algebra (to which we may pass from a semisimple K-algebra, cf.
1.1). Let Λ ⊆ A be a full R-order in A, that is, an R-algebra that spans A as a vec-
torspace such that Λ is finitely generated free as a module over R. Let 1Λ = e1 + · · · + ek
be an orthogonal decomposition into primitive idempotents of Λ, which correspond to
indecomposable projective Λ-modules Pj := ej Λ.


Remark 1.1 Suppose given a semisimple K-algebra B, a full R-order Ξ in B and a
simple Ξ-lattice X, that is, a Ξ-module that is finitely generated free over R such that
KX := K ⊗R X is a simple B-module. Let ε ∈ B be the central-primitive idempotent that
acts as identity on KX. Then X remains a simple lattice over the quasiblock Λ = Ξε,
which is a full R-order in A = Bε, and to which we may reduce the situation for our
purposes. Note that in general, the quasiblock Λ = Ξε will not be a direct summand of
Ξ.
If Q is an indecomposable projective Ξ-module, then Qε (⊆ KQ) is either zero or an inde-
composable projective Λ-module. All indecomposable projective Λ-modules are obtained
this way.
For instance, if G is a finite group and K a field of characteristic 0, we may take B = KG,
Ξ = RG and ε the rational central-primitive idempotent belonging to the simple KG-
module KX.
                                                                                              7


1.1.2   A suborder ∆ ⊆ Λ

Let Pjl be representatives of the isomorphism classes of the indecomposable projective
Λ-modules, l ∈ [1, m], and let
                                                   X
                                  fl :=                             ej ′ .
                                           j ′ ∈[1,k], Pj ′ ≃ Pjl


Then the fl + Jac(Λ) are the central-primitive idempotents of Λ/Jac(Λ). Letting Dl :=
ejl Λ/ejl Jac(Λ), a complete system of inequivalent simple Λ-modules is given by {Dl | l ∈
[1, m]}, and fl operates as identity on Dl .
This allows to introduce an R-suborder
                                             Y
                                 ∆ :=                fl Λfl ⊆ Λ
                                           l∈[1,m]

that has the same Grothendieck group as Λ, but that allows to decompose modules into
smaller pieces. Since Λ = l,l′∈[1,m] fl Λfl′ has Jacobson radical
                         L

                                                       !                             
                                  M                                     M
                      Jac(Λ) =          Jac(fl Λfl )        ⊕                  fl Λfl′  ,
                                    l                                   l6=l′

the inclusion ∆ ⊆ Λ induces an isomorphism
                                                 ∼✲
                                ∆/Jac(∆)               Λ/Jac(Λ) ,

whence restriction yields

                             K0 (modf-∆) ✛∼ K0 (modf-Λ) .


1.1.3   Multiplicities

Let X be a simple Λ-lattice. There are various multiplicities to be considered.
By [X̄ : Dl ] we denote the multiplicity of Dl in a composition series of X̄ in the sense of
Jordan-Hölder. By [Λ : Pj ] we denote the multiplicity of Pj as a direct summand of Λ,
which is well defined since Krull-Schmidt holds for projective Λ-modules by Nakayama’s
Lemma. Finally, by [KPj : KX] we denote the multiplicity of KX in KPj as a Jordan-
Hölder constituent, or, equivalently, as a direct summand.
Denote E := dimK EndA KX and El := dimR̄ EndΛ Dl . Brauer reciprocity holds,

                            E · [KPjl : KX] = El · [X̄ : Dl ] ,

since the K-dimension of KXejl and the R̄-dimension of X̄ejl coincide, and since the
latter is calculated by the right hand side, as we see after passing to the case Λ = ∆fl ,
and subsequently reducing moritaequivalently to the case ejl = 1. Moreover,

                                 El · [Λ : Pjl ] = dimR̄ Dl .
8


In particular, fl is the sum of El−1 · dimR̄ Dl primitive idempotents.
More generally, if M is a ∆-module of finite length over R, then [M : Dl ] denotes the
Jordan-Hölder multiplicity of Dl in M as a ∆-module. If M happens to be the restriction
of a Λ-module to ∆, this is the same as the multiplicity of Dl in M as a Λ-module. So
we do not need to specify whether the multiplicity refers to ∆ or to Λ.

Remark 1.2 If there exists a l ∈ [1, m] such that El = 1 and [X̄ : Dl ] = 1, then E = 1.
In other words, if some Dl is absolutely simple and appears with multiplicity 1 in X̄, then
KX is absolutely simple, too.
Conversely, if KX is absolutely simple and [KPjl : KX] = 1, then Dl is absolutely simple.


1.2    Jantzen filtration
      We recall the basic facts concerning Jantzen’s filtration arising from an embedding of
      simple Λ-lattices. This filtration is a tool to compare decomposition numbers with Jordan-
      Hölder multiplicities in the quotient of this embedding.

        ϕ
Let X ✲ Y be a nonzero Λ-linear map between simple lattices X and Y , thus necessarily
injective. There exists an N ≥ 0, which we choose and fix, such that π N Y ⊆ Xϕ.


Definition 1.3 For i ≥ 0, we let

                              X̄(i) := ((π i Y )ϕ−1 + πX)/πX ⊆ X̄
                                                                                         ϕ
be the ith piece of the Jantzen filtration of X̄ with respect to X ✲ Y . In particular,
X̄(0) = X̄, and X̄(N + 1) = 0. Given l ∈ [1, m], the ith Jantzen multiplicity of Dl is given
by
                             ϑl,i := [X̄(i)/X̄(i + 1) : Dl ] .


Remark 1.4 Note that X(i) ≃ (π i Y ∩ Xϕ)/(π i Y ∩ πXϕ), and thus

                             X̄(i)                π i Y ∩ Xϕ
                                     ≃                                .
                           X̄(i + 1)   (π i+1 Y ∩ Xϕ) + (π i Y ∩ πXϕ)

If we consider this subquotient as an R-module, by an elementary divisor decomposition
we may assume that X = Y = R, and that ϕ is given by multiplication by π j for some
j ≥ 0. Then X̄(i)/X̄(i + 1) is isomorphic to R̄ if i = j, and to zero otherwise. Returning
to the general case, we obtain therefore
                                                                                             dim Dl
                                                                                                  R̄
                                i    dimR̄ X̄(i)/X̄ (i+1)                           i   ϑ
                     M                                             M          M

                                                                                                        .

Lemma 1.5 (Jantzen’s Lemma)

  (i) In K0 (modf-Λ), we have [Y /Xϕ] =                   i≥1 [X̄(i)]   =             i [X̄(i)/X̄(i + 1)].

                                                                                i≥0

 (ii) In K0 (modf-∆), we have [Y fl /Xϕfl ] =                   i≥1 [X̄(i)fl ]        =         i [X̄(i)fl /X̄(i + 1)fl ]

                                                                                          i≥0
      for any l ∈ [1, m].

(iii) Given l ∈ [1, m], we have

                                ϑl,i = [X̄ : Dl ]     = [X̄fl : Dl ]
                        P
                            i≥0

                            i≥0 iϑl,i = [Y /Xϕ : Dl ] = [Y fl /Xϕfl : Dl ] .
                        P



Assertion (ii) follows from (i) by decomposition in modf-∆. The second formula in (iii)
follows from (i, ii), the first follows from the definition of ϑl,i .
It remains to prove (i). There is a filtration of Λ-modules

  π N Xϕ = π N −0 Xϕ ∩ π N Y ⊆ π N −1 Xϕ ∩ π N Y ⊆ · · · ⊆ π N −N Xϕ ∩ π N Y = π N Y ,

the ith subquotient of which is

                        π N −i Xϕ ∩ π N Y     Xϕ ∩ π i Y
                                            ≃             = X̄(i)
                      π N −(i−1) Xϕ ∩ π N Y   πXϕ ∩ π i Y

for i ∈ [1, N].

Corollary 1.6 Suppose given l ∈ [1, m]. If [X̄ : Dl ] = 1, then
                                            
                                            1    if i = [Y /Xϕ : Dl ] ,
                             ϑl,i =
                                            0    otherwise .


Corollary 1.7 Suppose given l ∈ [1, m]. Let s ≥ 1. If ϑl,i = 0 for i ∈ [0, s − 1] and if
[Y /Xϕ : Dl ] ≤ s[X̄ : Dl ], then
                                            
                                             [X̄     : Dl ] if i = s ,

                                           0                 otherwise .

In fact, the assumptions yield         i≥s+1 (i   − s)ϑl,i ≤ 0.

Suppose given Λ-linear maps (X ✲ Y ✲ X) = (X ✲ X), where a ∈ R and vπ (a) = N.
Note that given ϕ and N as above, such a map ψ exists. Consider the Jantzen filtration

1.4    Block diagonalization

      We shall describe, to a certain extent, the block matrices of the block diagonalization of
      X ✲ Y resulting from a decomposition of 1Λ into orthogonal primitive idempotents. The
          ϕ


      problem that remains, once all decomposition numbers and Jantzen multiplicities deter-
      mined, is to find the elementary divisors of the blocks of size > 1. This amounts to a study
      of the local and rationally simple R-algebras ej Λej , which in concrete examples seems to
      be difficult to get a grip on.


Lemma 1.9 For l ∈ [1, m], we have

                                                           (R/π i R)ϑl,i ·El .

Corollary 1.10 Choosing R-linear bases in the direct summands Xej of X and Y ej of

2     Elementary divisors for Specht modules
      The calculation of the elementary divisors of the Gram matrix of a Specht lattice is equiva-
      lent to the determination of the quotient S λ,∗ /S λ as an abelian group. Now, Schaper’s for-
                         λ,∗      λ
      mula expresses SZ     (p)
                                /SZ (p)
                                        as a linear combination of Specht modules in the Grothendieck
      group of Z(p) Sn -modules. Provided the decomposition numbers of the occurring Specht
      modules are known, this allows, by means of Jantzen’s Lemma, to compare the decompo-
                 λ,∗     λ                                    λ
      sition of SZ (p)
                       /SZ (p)
                                with the decomposition of SF    p
                                                                  , and thus in simple cases to determine
                                                      λ
      the distribution of the simple constituents of SF p
                                                          over the subquotients of the Jantzen fil-
      tration. Together with the dimensions of these simple constituents, this yields the structure
          λ,∗    λ
      of SZ   /SZ  (p)
                       as an abelian group by (1.4).

2.1     Specht modules
A λ-tabloid {a} is a λ-tableau [a] with unordered rows. Let M λ be the free Z-module on
the set of λ-tabloids, carrying a structure as a ZSn -module by entrywise operation of Sn .
That is, M λ is isomorphic to the permutation module on (Sλ1 × · · · × Sλn )\Sn . Let the
Sn -invariant bilinear form (−, =) on M λ be defined by
                                                           
                                                              1 if {a} = {b},
                                  ({a}, {b}) :=
                                                              0 if {a} =
                                                                        6 {b}.

Let Ca ≤ Sn denote the column stabilizer of [a]. A λ-polytabloid is given by

                                                        {a}σεσ ∈ M λ .
                                                  X
                                     hai :=
                                                 σ∈Ca

The Specht module S λ is defined to be the Z-linear span of the λ-polytabloids in M λ .
It carries a ZSn -module structure as a submodule of M λ , and it carries an Sn -invariant
bilinear form by restriction of (−, =) to S λ , again denoted by (−, =). To simplify notation,
we sometimes rescale by the James factor to
                                                                     −1

                                                     (λ′i − λ′i+1 )! · (−, =) ,
                                                 Y
                             (−, =)0 := 
                                                 i≥1

cf. [5, 10.4].
A standard basis of S λ over Z is given by the set of standard polytabloids, where a standard
polytabloid hai is attached to a tableau [a] with strictly increasing rows from left to right,
and strictly increasing columns from top to bottom. For the Garnir relations between
polytabloids we refer to [5, 7.2]. Let
                                                       η
                                            Sλ         ✲ S λ,∗

whose cokernel shall be denoted by S λ,∗ /S λ .
12


For a commutative ring A, we denote by SAλ the ASn -module A ⊗Z S λ .
                                                                        η
Given a prime p, the Jantzen filtration of SFλ p with respect to SZλ(p) ✲ SZλ,∗
                                                                             (p)

defined in (1.3) as being given by
                                                                                  
                              SFλ p (i) =        (pi SZλ,∗
                                                        (p)
                                                            )η −1 + pSZ(p) /pSZ(p) ⊆ SFλ p ,

yielding a decreasing filtration as i runs over Z≥0 . Note that SFλ p (0)/SFλ p (1) ≃ DFλ p , which
is, according to the convention adopted here, nonzero if and only if λ is p-regular [5, 12.2,
11.1]. In this case, DFλ p does not appear in SFλ p (1) by [5, 12.2].
In a linear combination expressing [SFλ p ] in K0 (modf-Z(p) Sn ) in terms of simple modules, a
lower index i ≥ 0 indicates that this summand appears as a summand of the subquotient
[SFλ p (i)/SFλ p (i + 1)]. Thus, this summand appears with multiplicity i in [SZλ,∗
                                                                                  (p)
                                                                                      /SZλ(p) ] (1.5
iii). This is similar to the notation in [15], where one finds e.g.
        (4,3,22 ,1)            (8,3,1)                (6,5,1)        (10,2)                (10,2)              (12)                   (12)
      [SF2            ] = [DF2 ]2 + [DF2 ]3 + [DF2 ]4 + [DF2 ]7 + 3[DF2 ]4 + 2[DF2 ]7
                              (6,4,2)   (6,4,2)   (7,3,2)    (8,4)     (7,5)           (7,5)
                          +[DF2 ]5 + [DF2 ]8 + [DF2 ]5 + [DF2 ]5 + [DF2 ]6 + [DF2 ]7
                              (11,1)     (11,1)     (9,3)    (9,3)     (5,4,2,1)
                          +[DF2 ]6 + 4[DF2 ]9 + 2[DF2 ]7 + [DF2 ]9 + [DF2        ]10 .

(Presumably, there are also examples in which the multiplicity of a simple module is
distributed over more than two Jantzen subquotients.) Thus for instance,
                (4,3,22 ,1)            (4,3,22 ,1)                (10,2)               (12)           (7,5)              (9,3)
             [SF2             (7)/SF2                (8)] = [DF2           ] + 2[DF2 ] + [DF2 ] + 2[DF2 ] .

                                                                                                                      (4,3,22 ,1),∗      (4,3,22 ,1)
Hence the multiplicity of Z/27Z as a summand of the abelian group SZ(2)                                                               /SZ(2)
                              (10,2)                       (12)                   (7,5)                       (9,3)
is given by dimF2 DF2                  + 2 dimF2 DF2 + dimF2 DF2 + 2 dimF2 DF2                                        (1.4).


2.2     Two-row partitions
       We consider Specht modules indexed by two-row partitions, that is, partitions of the form
       (n − m, m). The basic ingredients that allow to use Jantzen’s Lemma are the theorem
       of James on the decomposition numbers of Specht modules of two-row partitions, which
                                                                           λ,∗     λ
       are contained in {0, 1}, and the theorem of Schaper, expressing [SZ   (p)
                                                                                 /SZ (p)
                                                                                         ] as linear
                                       λ
       combination of Specht modules [SF p
                                           ].


Let n ≥ 1, let 0 ≤ m ≤ n/2 and let p be a prime number.

                                                                                          

Suppose given integers s and t. If s ≥ 0 and t ≥ 1, we write them p-adically as s + 1 =

integer s + 1 is said to contain t to base p if (s ≥ 0, t ≥ 1, k > l and ti ∈ {0, si } for
i ∈ [0, l]) or if (s ≥ 0 and t = 0). Let

                                            1 if s + 1 contains t to base p

Corollary 2.4 Combining (2.2) and (2.3), we get

Theorem 2.5 In K0 (modf-Z(p) Sn ), we have

In other words, the right hand side lists the p-part of the elementary divisors of the Gram
matrix of the invariant bilinear form on the Specht module S (n−m,m) , which is unique up
to scalar, in an unordered manner.
Formula (2.5.1) follows by an application of (1.6) to (2.2) and (2.4), where R = Z(p) ,
                                  ϕ         (n−m,m) η✲ (n−m,m),∗
π = p, Λ = Z(p) Sn , and where (X ✲ Y ) = (SZ(p)      SZ(p)      ). Cf. [5, 4.12, 11.5].
Formula (2.5.2) now ensues by (1.4).

We draw a conclusion that will follow again from (3.5) below.

Corollary 2.6 If p > m, we obtain
                  (n−m,m)                  (n−m,m)                         X                                         (n−j,j)

                                                                  j∈[0,m−1]

Thus as Z(p) -modules, we have
                                                                                                                                  

                                                                                                                                          · n−2j+1

                                                               j ∈ [0,m−1]


For j ∈ [0, m − 1], we obtain µn,m,p ;j = vp (n + 1 − m − j), whence (2.6.1).
In (2.6.2) and (2.5.2), we remark that the summands are zero unless j ≡p n + 1 − m,
which happens at most once. If j ≡p n + 1 − m, we recall that the outer exponent in
                       (n−j,j)                       (n−j,j)
(2.5.2) is just dimFp DFp      , which equals dimFp SFp      by (2.2).


2.3       Numerical examples
      Example 2.7 (case m = 1) Let n ≥ 2. For p arbitrary, (2.6.2) yields
                                                  (n−1,1),∗            (n−1,1)

      This is also a particular case of (5.5) below.

      Example 2.8 (case m = 2) Let n ≥ 4. For p > 2, (2.6.2) yields

      For p = 2, (2.5.2) yields
                                                                                                                       n−2

      Note that for n = 4, where the elementary divisors of S (2,2) are 2 and 6, the result is formu-
      lated using redundant zero summands. In (5.14) below, we will give two bases essentially
      diagonalizing the Gram matrix of the Specht module to the transposed partition (cf. 4.3).

      Example 2.9 (case m = 3) Let n ≥ 6. For p > 3, (2.6.2) yields

2.4    Unimodular lattices in SQ
      Closely connected to the question for the elementary divisors of the Gram matrix is the
      question of the existence of unimodular lattices in a Specht module. For two-row partitions
      this investigation has been initiated by Plesken [25]. Our result now asserts the non-
      existence of such lattices in the cases not treated in loc. cit. Reformulated, this amounts to
      the assertion that a certain system of two Pell equations is only trivially solvable, the proof
      of which we owe to E. Wirsing. The number of solutions of general Pellian systems has
      been studied extensively (cf. [1], where also further references may be found). The method
      employed in the particular case here does not seem to generalize.


Let R be a localization of Z at a maximal ideal, or Z itself, let λ be a partition of n, and
           λ
let X ⊆ SQ   be a full RSn -lattice, i.e. an RSn -submodule that is finitely generated free
                       λ
over R of rank dimQ SQ   . We denote by

                                         X # := {v ∈ SQ
                                                      λ                  λ
                                                        | (v, X) ⊆ R} ⊆ SQ
its dual lattice. Note that X # ≃ X ∗ , the latter denoting the abstract R-dual.
If X ≃ X ∗ , the RSn -lattice X is called unimodular. Under our assumptions, this is
equivalent to the existence of a scalar a ∈ Q such that X = aX # .
                               λ
Given an inclusion X ⊆ Y ⊆ SQ    of full RSn -lattices, by self duality of simple Fp Sn -
modules for each prime p, we have [Y /X] = [X # /Y # ] in the Grothendieck group [5,
11.5].
We include a proof of a corollary of Plesken, restricting his argument to this corollary
as well.

Proposition 2.11 ([25, Cor. II.4]) Let p be a prime and assume λ to be p-regular. If
 λ
SQ contains a unimodular Z(p) Sn -lattice, then

                               [SZλ,∗
                                   (p)
                                       /SZλ(p) ] ∈ 2K0 (modf-Z(p) Sn ) .

          λ
Let X ⊆ SQ  be a unimodular Z(p) Sn -lattice, let a ∈ Q such that X = aX # . Let m ∈ Z(p)
be such that mSZλ(p) ⊆ X. The filtration

                               mSZλ(p) ⊆ X = aX # ⊆ am−1 SZλ,#
                                                            (p)


shows that [am−1 SZλ,#
                    (p)
                        /mSZλ(p) ] ∈ 2K0 (modf-Z(p) Sn ). Therefore, there exists s ∈ Z such
that
                         [SZλ,∗
                             (p)
                                 /SZλ(p) ] + s[SFλ p ] ∈ 2K0 (modf-Z(p) Sn )
Since λ is p-regular, counting multiplicities of DFλ p yields s ∈ 2Z by (1.5 i) and [5, 12.2].

Remark 2.12 The converse to (2.11) holds as well, provided the decomposition numbers
of SFλ p are in {0, 1}. For this direction, λ need not be p-regular.
In fact, suppose [SZλ,∗(p)
                                                                              λ,∗
                           /SZλ(p) ] ∈ 2K0 (modf-Z(p) Sn ). Let SZλ(p) ⊆ M ⊆ SQ   be a full
Z(p) Sn -lattice that is maximal with respect to the property that (M, M) ⊆ Z(p) . Let
                     a
a ≥ 0 such that p2 M # ⊆ M.
     b                                          b−1               b−1                 b
If p2 M # ⊆ M for some b ≥ 1, then (p2 M # , p2 M # ) = (M # , p2 M # ) ⊆ (M # , M) ⊆
                          b−1                            b−1
Z(p) , whence M = M + p2 M # by maximality of M, i.e. p2 M # ⊆ M. By induction,
starting with b = a, we conclude that pM # ⊆ M ⊆ M # .
Now by the filtration SZλ(p) ⊆ M ⊆ M # ⊆ SZλ,#(p)
                                                  , the decomposition numbers of M # /M
are even. But since M # /M is a quotient of M # /pM # , the decomposition numbers of
which are in {0, 1} by assumption, we infer that M = M # .

Now let λ = (n − m, m). The cases m = 1 and m = 2 have been treated in [25, p. 98
and II.5].

                                                                   (n−m,m)
Theorem 2.13 Let 3 ≤ m ≤ n/2. The module SQ                                  does not contain a unimodular
ZSn -lattice.
Given a prime p, Schaper’s formula reads
                                                               n − 2m + 1 + i
                                                                              
              (n−m,m),∗     (n−m,m)          X                                  (n−m+i,m−i)
           [SZ(p)         /SZ(p)      ] =             vp                      [SFp          ].
                                            i∈[1,m]
                                                                     i

First, let us consider the case 2m = n. If there was a unimodular ZSn -lattice, there would
                                                (m+2,m−2)               (n−m,m),∗   (n−m,m)
be a unimodular Z(3) Sn -lattice. However, DF3            appears in [SZ(3)       /SZ(3)    ]
with multiplicity 1, so this is impossible by (2.11).
Now, let us consider the case 2m < n and assume the existence of a unimodular ZSn -
lattice. At a prime p, existence of a unimodular Z(p) Sn -lattice implies by (2.11) that
                                                                                                         17

                                                 (n−m,m),∗     (n−m,m)
all multiplicities of simple modules in [SZ(p)               /SZ(p)              ] are even. Considering the
                    (n−m+i,m−i)
multiplicity of   DFp             for i ∈ [1, m], beginning with           i = 1, we obtain the condition
                               
                       n−2m+1+i
that 2 divides    vp       i
                                   for all i ∈ [1, m]. Since this
                                                               holds for all primes p, and at
least for i ∈ [1, 3], we conclude that there exist positive integers x, y, z such that
                                        n − 2m + 2 = x2
                                        n − 2m + 3 = 2y 2
                                        n − 2m + 4 = 3z 2 ,
whence
                                            2y 2 − x2 = 1
(∗)
                                            3z 2 − x2 = 2 .
E. Wirsing [31] proved that (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1) is the only solution of (∗) in positive
integers, as reproduced below. Since x = 1 would correspond to n = 2m−1, this assertion
contradicts the assumption on the existence of a unimodular ZSn -lattice and proves the
theorem.
First, we remark that a solution (x, y, z) consists of pairwise coprime integers, and that
x ≡2 1.
The rational points (ξ, ζ) on the ellipse ξ 2 + 3ζ 2 = 4 are parametrized by
                                                 1 − 3t2
                                                                      !
                                                           4t
                                 (ξ, ζ) =      2         ,                   ,
                                                 1 + 3t 1 + 3t2
                                                       2

where t ∈ Q ∪ {∞}. Letting (ξ, ζ) = ( xy , yz ), a solution (x, y, z) yields such a rational
point. We may exclude t = ∞, corresponding to (−2, 0), since z 6= 0. Writing t = rs with
coprime positive integers r and s, we obtain r ≡2 s ≡2 1 since r 6≡2 s would imply x ≡2 0.
If s 6≡3 0, then rs and (s2 + 3r 2)/4 are coprime, whence
                                                                                   
                          (x, y, z) =   (s2 − 3r 2 )/2, (s2 + 3r 2 )/4, rs .
Now x2 = 3z 2 − 2 yields
                                                                    2

(∗∗1 )                            s4 − 1 = 2 ·          (r − s2 )        .
                                                      4
If s ≡3 0, then rs/3 and (s2 + 3r 2 )/12 are coprime, whence
                                   1 2                                

       2      2
Now x = 3z − 2 yields
                                                                      2

                                          12
By a result of Euler, however, the integral equation
(∗∗)                                        u4 − v 4 = 2w 2
is unsolvable if w 6= 0 [32, p. 82]. Therefore, the only solution to (∗) in positive integers
results from (∗∗2 ) as being (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1).

2.5     Some three- and four-part partitions

       The partial results and conjectures that follow we could lift from the table of F. Lübeck
       [15] and from calculations of decomposition numbers due to James, Williams, To Law,
       Benson, Müller et al. [2, 5, 10, 18, 19, 20, 30]. See also [5, p. 113]. A general result
       for p large that covers the respective first cases listed in this section, is given below (3.5).


Recall that we stipulated the module DFµ p to be zero whenever µ is not a p-regular parti-
tion.


Proposition 2.14 (n − 3, 2, 1) Let n ≥ 5. For p > 3, we have

       (n−3,2,1)             (n−3,2,1)                         (n−2,12 )                                      (n−2,2)

For p = 2, we have
                      (n−3,2,1)              (n−3,2,1)                               (n−2,2)

For p = 3, we have

Schaper’s formula (see e.g. [16, 5.33]) reads
                                                                                                                       

                                                                                                                            [SFp ]

where p is an arbitrary prime, and where n ≥ 6. We expand this formula into simple
modules using [5, 24.15] and [10, App.]. Since by loc. cit. the decomposition numbers of
  (n−3,2,1)
SFp         itself are contained in {0, 1, 2}, we may apply (1.6, 1.7) to obtain the distribution
of the occurring simple modules over the Jantzen subquotients as stated above.

                                                         (n−4,22 )       (n−2,2)
Lemma 2.15 Let n ≥ 6. We have [SF2                                   : DF2            ] = {n ≡2 0} .
This follows by [10, 3.13] if n is odd, and by [10, 4.5] if n is even. We state this explicitly
since in this case we do not have λ3 < p, cf. [10, Introduction; more precisely, 4.13].

Lemma 2.19 Suppose given n ≥ 6.

This follows from [10, 3.6, 3.13]. Again, we state this explicitly, this time since
(n − 4, 2, 12) is a four-part-partition. Assertion (i) also follows by [6, Th. A].

As a general pattern, one seems to observe the following.

Conjecture 2.22 Let p be a prime, let n ≥ 1. Given a partition λ of n and an integer

for i ≥ 0. I.e. we cut the last row that meets the jth column in the jth column and
append that piece in the first row.
Let R(µ) = {i ≥ 1 | µi > µi+1 } be the set of row numbers of removable nodes. Given
k ∈ R(µ), we denote by µ(k) the partition of n − 1 defined by

for i ≥ 0. I.e. the diagram of µ(k) is obtained from the diagram of µ by removing the last
node in row k.
Let λ be a partition of n, and suppose λ 6= (n). Suppose p to be a prime strictly bigger
than n − λ1 = i≥2 λi . Given j ∈ [1, λ2 ], we denote by hj := λ1 − j + λ′j the hook length of
                 P

the node (1, j) of the diagram of λ. Note that p divides at most one of the numbers hj for
j ∈ [1, λ2 ] since h1 −hλ2 < p. If p divides ht , we denote s = λ′t . Note that t ∈ [λs+1 +1, λs ].

We shall need a particular case of the direction of the Carter Conjecture that has been
proven by James and Murphy.

Theorem 3.2 ([9, p. 222]) If p does not divide hj for all j ∈ [1, λ2 ], then SFλ p is irre-
ducible.

The following is a particular case of a result of Carter and Payne.
                                                                                                                                  λ[t]
Theorem 3.3 ([3, p. 425]) Suppose that p divides ht . Then HomFp Sn (SFp , SFλ p ) 6= 0.
                                  λ[t]
In particular, [SFλ p : DFp ] ≥ 1.

The idea of proof and the main ingredient of (3.4), hence of (3.5), are due to Kleshchev.

                                                                                                                      λ[t]
Proposition 3.4 Suppose that p divides ht . Then [SFλ p ] = [DFλ p ] + [DFp ].
Consider the case λ1 > λ2 . By (3.3), it suffices to show equality of the restrictions to
Sn−1 in the Grothendieck group. To prove this equality, by induction, we may assume the
assertion to hold for Sn−1 , yielding
                           [5, 9.2]             λ(i)

On the other hand, since all removable nodes, except for (s, t) if λs = t, are normal, and,
using p | ht, all normal nodes are good, modular branching [11, 0.6] enables us to calculate
                                                                                              λ(i)

                                                                            {λi 6= t}[DFp ] ,
                                                                   i∈R(λ)

as well as
                         λ[t]                                               λ(s)[t−1]            X                 λ(i)[t]

                                                                                              i∈R(λ)\{s}

We are done by remarking that if λs > t, then λ(s)[t] = λ(1)[t]; that if λs = t, then
λ(s) = λ(1)[t]; and that if λs+1 + 1 < t, then λ(s)[t − 1] = λ(1)[t − 1].
Consider the case λ1 = λ2 . From p | ht we conclude that λ2 + λ′1 ≥ p + 1, and from
p > n − λ1 we infer that λ2 + λ′1 < p + 2. Now, λ2 + λ′1 = p + 1 leads to λ = (k 2 , 1l ), with
k ≥ 1, l ≥ 0 and k + l = p − 1, so in particular t = 1.
                                                        λ[t]             (1p )                                                                    (1p )
If k = 1, then [SFλ p ] = [DFλ p ] + [DFp ], since [DFp ] = 0 by convention, and since [SFp ] =
  (2,1p−2 )
[DFp          ] by [6, Th. A].
If k > 1, we obtain one the one hand, by induction,
                                                                                                              
                          (k,k−1,1l )                              (k+1,k−1,1l−1 )              (k 2 ,1l−1 )                                    (n−1)
  [SFλ p ]|Sn−1 = [DFp                    ] + {l ≥ 1} [DFp                             ] + [DFp                ] + {l = 0}[DFp                          ].

On the other hand, modular branching [11, 0.6] yields
                                         (k 2 ,1l )                 (k,k−1,1l )
                                    [DFp              ]|Sn−1 = [DFp          

                                (k+1,k,1l−1 )                                         (k+1,k−1,1l−1 )                (k 2 ,1l−1 )

Thus
                               (k 2 ,1l )
                  [SFλ p ] = [SFp           ]

                         =   [DFλ p ] + [DFp ] .


Theorem 3.5 Let λ be a partition of n, let p be a prime such that p > n − λ1 . Let hj
and, if existent, t be as in (3.1).
If p does not divide hj for any j ∈ [1, λ2 ], then

                                                   [SFλ p ] = [DFλ p ]0 .

If p divides ht , then
                                                                        λ[t]
                                  [SFλ p ] = [DFλ p ]0 + [DFp ]vp (ht ) .

If p divides ht , Schaper’s formula (see e.g. [16, 5.33]) reads

                                                                                            λhii

where the diagram of the partition of λhii is obtained by removing the skew hook belonging
to the node (i, t) from the diagram of λ, and by attaching as many nodes to the first row
as there are in this skew hook (cf. [9, p. 223]).
Now, if hhiij denotes the hook length of the node (1, j) of the diagram of λhii, where
j ∈ [1, λ2 ], and if p divides hhiithii , then λhii[thii] = λhi − 1i for i ∈ [3, s]. Moreover,
                    λh2i    λh2i
λhsi = λ[t], and SFp = DFp by (3.2). Thus by (3.4), we have

                                                                               λ[t]

and we are done by (1.6).

For i > vp (n!/nλ ), we have SFλ p (i)/SFλ p (i + 1) = 0.
By [5, 6.7] (and [13, 6.2.5]), we have an isomorphism

           and N = vp (n!/nλ ).

                                                                                     ′
Corollary 4.2 We have SFλ p (vp (n!/nλ ))/SFλp (vp (n!/nλ ) + 1) ≃ DFλ p,− .

Corollary 4.3 For i ∈ [1, nλ ], the product of the ith elementary divisor of the Gram
                                                                                 ′
matrix of S λ and the (nλ + 1 − i)th elementary divisor of the Gram matrix of S λ yields
n!/nλ .
In particular, the largest elementary divisor of the Gram matrix of S λ divides n!/nλ .
The first argument is to localize at a prime p and to apply (1.4) to (4.1). In this sense,
(4.1) is the module version of (4.3).
The second argument is to consider the composition used in the proof of (4.1) directly,
which yields the result without reverting to localization.

      Remark 4.4 A Brauer-Nesbitt type argument (cf. section 6.3) shows that if G is a finite
      group, R a discrete valuation ring of characteristic zero with fraction field K splitting G,
      and X a simple RG-lattice carrying a nondegenerate G-invariant R-bilinear form, then the
      quotient of the last elementary divisor by the first elementary divisor of the Gram matrix
      of this bilinear form divides |G|/rkR X in R. In this generality, there is no substitute for
      transposition of partitions. Nonetheless, in our particular case this fact can be derived using
      transposition of partitions (4.3).

The following has been discovered by C. D. Gay and rederived by James and Murphy
(cf. [9, p. 234]).

                                                                                                           ′
Corollary 4.5 The product of the determinants of the Gram matrices of S λ and of S λ
is given by (n!/nλ )nλ .

For later use, we record the related

                                              n!
Lemma 4.6 We have (haiρ+
                       a , −) =                  ({a}, −).
                                              nλ
To this end, we compose the string of morphisms displayed in the proof of (4.1) from S λ,∗
to S λ,∗ .

Sometimes, we shall abbreviate haiρ+        +
                                   a =: haiρ .




5       Explicit bases
        So far, we have been calculating elementary divisors of Gram matrices for Specht modules
        without reference to any explicit diagonalization. Instead, we made use of known decom-
        position numbers as well as of Schaper’s formula.
        It would be preferable to construct two bases diagonalizing the Gram matrix, but this seems
        to be difficult in general. For hook partitions, however, explicit diagonalization is a simple
        (and precise) way to get the elementary divisors (5.5). We also treat the partition (22 , 1n−4 )
        in this manner (5.14), but already this modest case indicates how complicated such bases
        seem to look like in general, at least in terms of polytabloids. We remark that even for
        simple modules whose dimension is known (such as two-row partitions, three-row partitions
        with third row < p, or those treated in [17]), explicit bases are largely unknown (or at least
        unpublished). Such a basis, lifted to the Specht module of the same partition, could locally
        be used as part of a diagonalizing basis. The bases found so far diagonalize globally.
        To simplify, we spare ourselves the construction of the second basis by giving the first basis
        in a convenient manner with respect to the standard choice of the second, see section 5.1. By
        a matrix inversion of a unipotent upper triangular integral matrix, a diagonalizing second
        basis ensues.



5.1      A linear algebra lemma
Lemma 5.1 Let X be a finitely generated free Z-module of rank m ≥ 1, let (−, =) be a
nondegenerate bilinear form on X. Let G be the Gram matrix of that bilinear form with
respect to some Z-linear basis. Let (x1 , . . . , xm ), (y1 , . . . , ym) be two tuples of elements of
X such that the following hold.

    (i) We have (xi , yi ) 6= 0 for all i ∈ [1, m].

 (ii) We have (xi , yj ) = 0 for all i, j ∈ [1, m] such that i > j.
                                                                                                      27


(iii) (xi , yi ) divides (xi , yj ) for all i, j ∈ [1, m] such that i < j.
 (iv) (xi , yi ) divides (xi+1 , yi+1 ) for all i ∈ [1, m − 1].
 (v)     i∈[1,m] (xi , yi )   = ± det G.
       Q


Then the tuples (x1 , . . . , xm ) and (y1 , . . . , ym ) are Z-linear bases of X. The elementary
divisors of G are given by the tuple of integers
                                                                                      
                                      (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), . . . , (xn , yn ) .

Let g : X ✲ X ∗ send ξ ∈ X to (ξ, −). The tuple (x1 , . . . , xm ) is linear independent over
Z, as its image in X ∗ via g shows, using (i, ii). Likewise, the tuple (y1, . . . , ym ) is linearly
independent. In the composite embedding
                                           ✄ f   ✄ g     ✄ h
                       Zhx1 , . . . , xm i ✂ ✲ X ✂ ✲ X ∗ ✂ ✲ Zhy1 , . . . , ym i∗ ,
both fgh and g have determinant ± det G, by (v). Thus f and h are equalities. Now
(i, ii, iii, iv) ensure that the elementary divisors result as claimed.

The element yi of the second basis is called the diagonal correspondent of the element xi
of the first basis.


5.2     Bases for hooks
       The result of this section has independently been observed by Mathas and James [unpub-
       lished]. As ingredient for (5.1 v), we shall make use of the determinant of the Gram matrix,
       but not of Schaper’s formula itself.

Let n ≥ 2, let l ∈ [0, n − 1], and let λ := (n − l, 1l ) be a hook partition of n. Note that a
λ-polytabloid is determined by the tuple of entries in the first column, read from top to
bottom. So given a tuple b = (b0 , b1 , . . . , bl ), the entries bi ∈ [1, n] pairwise distinct, we
shall write hbi for the λ-polytabloid it determines. In the sequel, by a tuple we understand
a tuple with pairwise distinct entries. To the underlying set of a tuple we refer without
further comment.
                                                                        
                                                      λ         n−1
Counting ordered tuples, we obtain rkZ S =                       l
                                                                          .

If b is a tuple and x an element, then (x, b) denotes the tuple b with an entry x appended
on the left, (b, x) denotes the tuple b with an entry x appended on the right, etc. If tuple
brackets appear within tabloid or polytabloid brackets,* we+omit the tuple brackets. For
                                                                              214
instance, if n = 5, l = 2 and b = (5, 3), then h2, bi =                       5            .
                                                                              3

                                                                                
                                                          n−1                n−2
                                                           l                 l−1
Lemma 5.2 We have #(S λ,∗ /S λ ) = l!                               ·n                 .
This follows by induction on n using the Branching Theorem for Determinants [9, p. 225].

Lemma 5.3 Suppose given increasingly ordered tuples b, c ⊆ [2, n − 1] of length #b =

Theorem 5.5 As abelian groups, we have

Bases x and y that trigonalize the Gram matrix in the sense of (5.1) are given by a tuple
y consisting of the standard basis, ordered in such a manner that all elements without
entry n in the first column are before all elements with entry n in the first column, and by
a tuple x = (x′ , x′′ ), with x′ consisting of the elements of the form hn, bi as in (5.3), with
respective diagonal correspondent h1, bi in y, and x′′ consisting of elements of the form
  s∈[1,n]\d hs, d, ni as in (5.4), with respective diagonal correspondent h1, d, ni in y.

Remark 5.7 (Jantzen subquotients) Let p be a prime. To consider the Jantzen sub-
quotients, we have to distinguish two cases.
Case p ≥ 3. Given a partition ν, we denote by ν r the p-regularized partition in the sense
of [6, p. 46], where the corresponding diagram construction is explained – the diagram of
ν being given by [ν] := {(i, j) ∈ Z≥1 × Z≥1 | j ≤ νi }.
                                                                  r
Now, if p does not divide n, then SFλ p ≃ DFλ p is simple [6, p. 52]. By (5.5), we obtain
                                                                          r
                                               [SFλ p ] = [DFλ p ]vp (l!) .
                                                                                                                                                        29


So suppose that p divides n.
If l = 0, we obtain
                                                                    (n)               (n)
                                               [SFλ p ] = [SFp ] = [DFp ]0 .
If l = n − 1, we obtain by [6, Th. A]
                                                                (1n )              (1n )r
                                           [SFλ p ] = [SFp ] = [DFp ]vp (n!) .

If l ∈ [1, n − 2], the decomposition numbers of [6, p. 52] and the long exact hook sequence
of [22, Lem. 2] (cf. [13, 4.2.3, 4.2.4]) give
                  (n−l,1l )               (n−l−{ l ≥ n−n/p},1∗ )r                               (n−(l−1)−{ (l−1) ≥ n−n/p},1∗ )r
  [SFλ p ] = [SFp             ] = [DFp                                      ]vp (l!) + [DFp                                                 ]vp (l! n) ,

where we abbreviated (n − j, 1∗ ) := (n − j, 1j ). In fact, the image in SFλ p of the differential
of the long exact hook sequence equals SFλ p (l! n), as results from a comparison of [13,
4.2.3] with (5.4).

                               #ζ = h − i .
Let [a] be the tableau with first column (ϑ, ϕ) and second column (ζ, ψ). Let [b] be the
tableau with first column (ζ, ϕ) and second column (ϑ, ψ). Then

First, assume that ζ and ψ remain fixed in [a], i.e. that τ restricts to the identity on ζ ∪ ψ.
In order to obtain {a}τ = {b}σ, the permutation σ has to restrict to the identity on ζ ∪ ψ
as well. Moreover, σ and τ have to restrict to the same automorphism of ϑ, whence the
factor (h − i)!, and to the same automorphism on ϕ, whence the factor (n − 2h + i)!. Next,
removing the assumption, we remark that we may simultaneously permute the rows 1 to
h of {a}τ and of {b}σ, whence the factor h!.

Lemma 5.10 Suppose given increasingly ordered tuples ξ, η ⊆ [1, n] of length h with
intersection of cardinality i. We write hξi for the polytabloid with second column ξ, and
first column [1, n]\ξ, increasingly ordered from top to bottom. Let ξ denote the sum of
                                                                    P

the entries of ξ. Then
                                                   (h − i)!(n − 2h + i)!           P P
                   (hξi, hηi)0 =                                         · (−1)h−i+ ξ+ η .
                                                         (n − 2h)!

This follows from (5.9) by reordering the columns of the polytabloids involved.

(5.10).

Lemma 5.11 We have

The transposed partition has #(S (n−2,2),∗ /S (n−2,2) ) = (n − 1) · (n − 2)n−1 /2, as we take
from the first example on [9, p. 224]. Since rkZ S λ = n(n−3)/2 by [5, 20.1], the assertion
ensues from (4.5).

6.1    Symmetric partitions
A partition λ is called symmetric if λ = λ′ , otherwise, it is called asymmetric. We remark
that by induction, ordinary branching [5, 9.2 ii] shows that if λ 6= (1) is symmetric, then
nλ := rkZ S λ is even.
Suppose given a symmetric partition λ 6= (1). Let m be the middle jump factor, i.e. the
quotient of the (nλ /2 + 1)st and the (nλ /2)th elementary divisor of the Gram matrix of
S λ . Let H := i∈[1,s] (2λi − 2i + 1) be the product of the main diagonal hook lengths,
                Q

where s = λs .

Proposition 6.1 The quotient H/m is a square in Q.
By (4.3), the quotient (n!/nλ )/m is the square of the (nλ /2)th elementary divisor of S λ .
But since n!/nλ is the product of all hook lengths of λ, and since λ is symmetric, we
conclude that H/m is a square in Q.

Conjecture 6.2 The quotient H/m is an integer.
Here is the list of the symmetric non-hook partitions whose elementary divisors are known
so far [15]. By (4.3), it is sufficient to list the respective first half of the elementary
34


divisors. Thus, the last elementary divisor we give is the (nλ /2 + 1)st, together with its
multiplicity.

Let α be the product of the strictly upper diagonal hook lengths of λ. Let γ be the
first elementary divisor of the Gram matrix of S λ . We denote E := EndZAn S λ and
EQ := Q ⊗Z E. Symmetry of λ gives
                                                [5, 6.7]        ′

and so

                                              ✄

(cf. section 2.4). By definition of β, we have ρλ (σ)β = βρλ (σ)εσ , where ρλ (σ) is the
operation of σ ∈ Sn on S λ .

Proposition
q              6.3 Suppose (−1)(n−s)/2 H not to be a square in Z and denote χ :=
  (−1)(n−s)/2 H. We have an isomorphism EQ ≃ Q(χ) (since a splitting field for EQ
contains the ordinary character values given by [8, 2.5.12, 2.15.13]), which we fix and
use asqan identification. Let h ∈ Z>0 be maximal such that h2 divides H, and let
χ0 := (−1)(n−s)/2 H/h2 . The following hold.

  (i) We have γ | αh.

 (ii) If the ring of algebraic integers in EQ is given by Z[χ0 ], then E = Z[αγ −1 χ]. If the
      ring of algebraic integers in EQ is given by Z[(1 + χ0 )/2], then the following holds.
      If αγ −1 h is even, then E = Z[αγ −1 χ]; if αγ −1 h is odd, then E = Z[αγ −1 h(1+χ0)/2]
      or E = Z[αγ −1 χ].

(iii) The elementary divisors of the Gram matrix of S λ and the elementary divisors of
      the operation of αχ ∈ E on the E-module S λ coincide.
                                                                                           35


Using the map Sn ✲ Gal(EQ /Q) given by conjugation by means of ρλ , we conclude that
β has trace zero, i.e. that β = ±α̃χ for some α̃ ∈ Q>0 .
On the other hand, β 2 = (−1)(n−s)/2 α̃2 H shows that the ith and the (nλ + 1 − i)th
elementary divisor of S λ multiply to give α̃2 H for i ∈ [1, nλ ]. But by (4.3), they multiply
to give n!/nλ , which is the product of the hook lengths of λ [5, 20.1]. Therefore, α̃ = α,
which proves (iii).
Suppose Z[x] to be the ring of algebraic integers in a quadratic number field, and suppose
F ⊆ Z[x] to be a subring of Z-rank 2. Choosing a Z-linear basis (u + vx, w + yx) of
F , where u, v, w, y ∈ Z, the existence of 1 ∈ F shows
                                                       that there are a, b ∈ Z such that
                                                   a b
au + bw = 1, av + by = 0. Base change by          −w u
                                                         yields a Z-linear basis of the form
(1, dx), d ≥ 1, i.e. E = Z[dx].
Now, γ −1 αχ is still contained in E. More precisely, α is minimal with this property, for
otherwise γ −1 αχ would not have 1 as first elementary divisor.
Therefore, if the ring of algebraic integers in EQ is given by Z[χ0 ], minimality of α yields
d = αγ −1 h. If the ring of algebraic integers in EQ is given by Z[(1 + χ0 )/2], minimality of
α yields d = αγ −1 h if d is odd, and d = 2αγ −1 h if d is even. This proves (ii). Moreover,
in all three cases αγ −1 h is integral, as asserted in (i).


                                  n−s
Proposition 6.4 Suppose (−1) 2 H to be a square in Z, so in particular n ≡4 s. We
have an isomorphism EQ ≃ Q × Q (since the central-primitive idempotents of CAn
                                 λ
belonging to the summands of SC    |An already lie in QAn , as the character values given in
[8, 2.5.12, 2.15.13] show), which we fix and use as an identification. The following hold.

                   √    q
  (i) We have γ | α H (= n!/nλ ).

                                                             √
 (ii) We have E = {(a, √ b) ∈ Z × Z | a√≡d b} with d = 2αγ −1 H if αγ −1 is even, and
      either d = 2αγ −1 H or d = αγ −1 H if αγ −1 is odd.

                                                     λ
(iii) The
       √ elementary divisors of the λGram matrix of S and those of the operation of
      α H(1, −1) on the E-module S coincide.


The nontrivial automorphism of EQ turns β into −β, whence      √ β = ±α̃(1, −1) for some
                  2    2
α̃ ∈ Q>0 . Since β = α̃ , comparison with (4.3) yields α̃ = α H, which proves (iii).
                                                                   √
We have E√= {(a, b) ∈ Z × Z | a ≡d b} for√  some d ≥ 1. But αγ −1 H is minimal in Q>0
with αγ −1 √ H(1, −1) ∈ E, that is, αγ −1√ H is integral – as claimed in (i)
                                                                          √ – and minimal
          −1
with 2αγ      H ≡d 0. Thus, d = αγ −1 H if d is odd, and d = 2αγ −1 H if d is even,
whence (ii).

      According to (6.3 iii, 6.4 iii), the main problem that remains to be solved is to determine
      the structure of S λ as an E-module. For example, the elementary divisors of S (3,2,1) √      are
      given by 14 · 34 · 154 · 454 , whereas on the free E-module E 8 , multiplication by αχ = 3 5
      has the elementary divisors 18 · 458 . Thus by (6.3 iii), S λ is not free over E, and not locally
      free at 3 either.

Example 6.6 The asymmetric example S µ of smallest dimension for which two successive
elementary divisors have quotient bigger than the outer hook length µ1 +µ′1 −1, is given by
µ = (9, 22, 1). In fact, we obtain the elementary divisors 4792 · 83421 · 120493 · 960714 · 2880586
[15], whereas the outer hook length is 12.

The following remark on partitions of rectangular shape pertains in particular to partitions
of quadratic shape.

Remark 6.7 Let µ be a partition such that µ1 = µh , where h = µ′1 . Let ν be the partition
obtained from µ by removing the lower right node in its diagram, i.e. νh := µh −1, νj := µj
for j 6= h. Then the elementary divisors of S µ are given by the elementary divisors of S ν ,
multiplied by the constant factor h.
We have S µ |Sn−1 ✛∼ S ν [5, 9.3], by sending a ν-polytabloid to the µ-polytabloid obtained
by adding the entry n in the lower right corner. Thus the invariant bilinear form on
S ν induces an invariant bilinear form on S µ , whence the Gram matrix of S µ is a scalar
multiple of the Gram matrix of S ν . This scalar is calculated to be h by the Branching
Theorem for Determinants [9, p. 225].

      There seems to be a connection between elementary divisors and modular morphisms. Apart
      from the fact that both yield necessary conditions on the shape of the quasiblock (cf. section
      6.3), we do not know of any a priori reason for such a connection to exist.

Let h ≥ 1, let k ∈ [1, h]. Abbreviate ν(k) := (2h−k , 1n−2h+k ) and b := n − 2h + 1. Let
F ν(0) be the free Z-module on the ν(0)-tableaux, endowed with the natural operation of
Sn , yielding F ν(0) ≃ ZSn . Consider the morphism
                                            fk
                                  F ν(0)    ✲ S ν(k) /(b + k)S ν(k)
                                     [a]    ✲                  Σ(ζ) ζ
                                                 ζ∈Z(a,k) (−1)     ha i ,
                                              P
                                                                                                   37


where Z(a, k) is the set of subtuples of length k of the second column of [a], where [aζ ] is
the µ-tableau given by removing ζ from the second column of [a] and appending it at the
bottom of the first column, and where Σ(ζ) is the sum of the positions of the entries of
ζ. So for example, if the second column is given by (3, 5, 6, 7, 9), and if ζ = (5, 7, 9), then
Σ(ζ) = 2 + 4 + 5.
Let p be a prime. Given m ≥ 1, we denote ilogp (m) := max{i ∈ Z≥0 | pi ≤ m}. Let
m? := p prime pilogp (m) (‘m quasi-factorial’, e.g. 4? = 12). From [14, 4.9] we take the
       Q

morphism
                                      sk
                              S ν(0) ✲ S ν(k) /(b + k)S ν(k)
                                hai ✲ k? · ([a]fk ) .
We will form an intersection of the kernels of a slight variation of these morphisms – the
factor k? can sometimes be lowered on a smaller domain.
Let S ν(0), ∩ 0 := S ν(0) , and s̃1 := s1 .
                                                                     s̃l
Assume submodules S ν(0), ∩ l−1 ⊆ S ν(0) and morphisms S ν(0), ∩ l−1 ✲ S ν(l) /(b + l)S ν(l) to
be constructed for l ∈ [1, k − 1].
Let S ν(0), ∩ k−1 :=                Kern s̃l . Let
                       T
                        l∈[1,k−1]

                                               s̃k
                             S ν(0), ∩ k−1      ✲ S ν(k) /(b + k)S ν(k)
                                                ✲      k?
                              hai thai hai                       hai thai ([a]fk ) ,

                                                  gcd(k?,γk−1 )

where the thai are coefficients in Z, and where γk−1 is the first elementary divisor of
S ν(0), ∩ k−1 ✂ ✲ S ν(0) .

Conjecture 6.8 The kernel of
                             η

                                                                                 S ν(0)

is given by the intersection

                                         S ν(0), ∩ h =
                                                           \
                                                                   Kern s̃k .
                                                         k∈[1,h]


Conjecture (6.8) holds if n ≤ 8 (direct computation), or if h = 1 (5.5). If h = 2, the
kernel is contained in the intersection (5.14).


6.3      A final remark on quasiblocks
Let p be a prime, let R = Z(p) , and let ελ denote the central-primitive idempotent of QSn
               λ
belonging to SQ  , for λ a partition of n. The quasiblocks ελ RSn of RSn may be viewed
as the ‘building blocks’ of the locally integral representation theory of the symmetric
group. The Gram matrix determines a certain part of the structure of such a quasiblock,
sometimes it even describes it in its entirety.

If all indecomposable projective ελ RSn -lattices are simple, that is, if the quasiblock is a
