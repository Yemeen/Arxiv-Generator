                                             1         Introduction
                                             Soergel has given a beautiful procedure [61, 60] for analysing tilting modules for
                                             quantum groups at roots of unity through parabolic Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials.
                                             The procedure itself may be applied formally to an alcove geometry, without refer-
                                             ence to representation theory. Hence it may be applied, in principle, in cases which
                                             are beyond the scope of Soergel’s proof of representation theoretic interpretation.
                                             It is interesting then to try to find algebras for which the resultant combinatorial
                                             data has a representation theoretic interpretation, even though Soergel’s proof is
                                             not applicable. The output of the usual procedure in type–A may be mapped by
                                             Ringel duality [22] to the content of projective modules for certain quotients of
                                             ordinary Hecke algebras. (There it may be understood in terms of idempotent de-
                                             compositions of 1 [53].) This leads to a determination of decomposition numbers for
                                             standard modules of the Hecke algebras themselves. Here we consider generalising
                                             the implementation of the procedure on this Ringel dual side. We do this by con-
                                             structing generalized Hecke algebra quotients which (mildly) generalize the usual
                                             role of alcove geometry.
                                                 One example where the formal procedure gives the correct decomposition num-
                                             bers is the blob algebra bn [52, 54] (a certain two parameter affine Hecke algebra
                                             quotient). We demonstrate the procedure for this example in §1.1 below. There is
                                             a set of key properties of bn (see §4.2), which it has in common with the ordinary
                                             Hecke algebra quotients (see §1.2), which may serve to explain the phenomenon. In
                                             this paper we discuss generalisations of bn which also possess these properties.
                                                 To generalise bn suitably we first place it in the context of affine/cyclotomic Hecke
                                             and Ariki–Koike–Levy algebras [10, 2, 50] (although these are not themselves the
                                             generalisations we require). The study of these algebras is interesting both abstractly
                                             and also since they are useful in studying solutions to the reflection equation in
                                             integrable statistical mechanics (see [50] for references). This parallels the role of
                                             ordinary Hecke algebras in solving the Yang–Baxter equation. In both cases the
                                             ‘physical’ representation theory focuses attention on specific quotients, and implies
                                             that decomposition number data should be organized in a certain specific way. In the
                                             ordinary Hecke case this is the ‘Soergel’ rather than the ‘LLT way’ [42] (as complete
                                             data sets these are equivalent but computationally they are not [53]). Thus while
                                             the algebras we shall construct have representation theory which is accessible in
                                             principle by LLT methods [1], this does not remove the need for a generalized (dual)
                                             Soergel approach. In §1.2 we discuss quotients of affine Hecke algebras generalizing
                                             bn which, like bn , realize certain key ingredients of this approach — in particular
                                             they possess a weight space. In §3 we imbue this space with an alcove structure and
                                                 1

verify a linkage principle[35]. These generalized algebras are quotients of cyclotomic
Hecke algebras by certain primitive and central idempotents. In §4 we show how
the simplest non–trivial such quotient may effectively be identified with bn . The
rest of the paper discusses outstanding technical issues in showing the validity of
the generalized Soergel procedure for the generalized algebras (the primitive and
central idempotents of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras are computed in §5).
    One property of the ordinary Hecke quotients not possessed by these generali-
sations is the defining representation on ‘tensor space’, realizing Ringel duality [21]
with a quantum group quotient (cf. [19, 3, 59]). Such a faithful tensor space repre-
sentation is not manifestly necessary for our purpose, but would be very useful. In §6
we address this problem, culminating in the construction of some intriguing new con-
crete representations of bn which are candidates. (The serendipitous constructions
of a number of other interesting new representations of bn and its generalisations
are outlined in §§7–8.)
    We will argue that the representation theory of these algebras, while containing
that of ordinary Lie theoretic objects, is in a sense more simply described. Given
that the representation theory of bn itself is known for q root of unity in arbitrary
charactersitic [15], the possibility that open questions in ordinary Lie representation
theory may be accessible by this route makes these algebras particularly interesting
objects for study.

1.1    Alcove geometry and decomposition numbers for bn
We will recall the definition [54, §2] of the blob algebra bn = bn (q, m) in §4.2. The
decomposition numbers in the ‘doubly critical’ case (q a primitive lth root of 1; m
an integer, |m| < l — see §4) in characteristic zero are determined in [54, §9] by
algebraic methods. A formal application of Soergel’s procedure to this case works
as follows.
    First recall, quite generally, that a Euclidean space with reflection hyperplanes
removed has a set (A, say) of connected components, called alcoves [35, Ch.6][9]. For
s a reflection hyperplane and B an alcove we denote by Bs the image of B in s. Each
nonempty intersection of the closure of an alcove with a hyperplane is called a wall
of the alcove (here we will confuse each such wall with the hyperplane containing it).
We make no assumption about the relation of hyperplanes to the origin 0, except
that the origin lies in the interior of an alcove, called the fundamental alcove and
denoted A0 . Define |B| as the number of hyperplanes between B and 0 (so |A0 | = 0).
    In algebraic Lie theory one starts with a set of ordinary (non–affine) reflections
generating the ordinary Weyl group. The (q)–group weight space is the underlying
Euclidean space with its origin ρ–shifted [35]. In particular, even when an affine
reflection is added the origin is at a fixed position at the base of the dominant
region. In our case there is effectively no ordinary Weyl group and no dominant
region, that is to say, the placement of all hyperplanes is controlled by parameters
of the algebra. Thus the weight space for the blob algebra, just as for sl2 , is the
Euclidean space associated to the A1 Coxeter system, i.e. it is effectively R [54,
§6]. However now, cf. sl2 , all integral weights are dominant, that is to say, simple
modules may be indexed by Z (we shall explain this, in the context of our generalised
construction, shortly). In the bn case, the reflection hyperplanes are just points, and
those generating the affine Weyl group lie at −m and l − m. (And an alcove B ∈ A
is a connected component of R with the reflection points removed.) A reflection is
                                                                                    3


‘upward’ if |B| < |Bs| (cf. the usual sl2 situation).
   For each alcove A one defines a map

                                    nA : A → Z[v]

where v is a formal parameter, as follows. (For simplicity we ignore features of
Soergel’s procedure which do not arise in our case.) Firstly nA (A) = 1 and nA (B) 6=
0 implies |B| ≤ |A|. Note that nA0 is determined immediately by this, and proceed
inductively on >. For each alcove A there will be a wall s of A such that |As| > |A|.
Each alcove B has one wall which is in the affine Weyl orbit of s, and we will write
B.s for the image of B in that wall (thus As = A.s). Then, with nA known, set

                              nA (B) + v −1 nA (B.s)
                           
                 ′                                       |B.s| > |B|
               nAs (B.s) =     −1
                              v nA (B) + nA (B.s)        |B.s| < |B|

and define nAs by
                                            X
                  nAs (C) = n′As (C) −                  n′As (B)|v=0 nB (C).
                                         B : |B|<|As|


(That this procedure is well defined is not trivial [61].)
    Evaluating nA (B)|v=1 , this construction is (formally) computing the standard
module content of tilting modules in a Ringel dual algebra. (Any two weights
which are in different affine Weyl orbits [35] are in different blocks [7, Ch.1]. Thus
each block intersects each alcove in at most 1 weight and, fixing a block, it is the
modules with these weights which nA (B)|v=1 describes.) The corresponding data for
bn is, in effect, the standard module content of projective modules. By reading by
column instead of row, as it were, we convert this to the simple module content of
standard modules [21] (truncation to a finite column interval, such as that pictured
in the example which follows, corresponds to localisation to some finite n — see
ingredient I2 below). As noted, this construct is entirely formal, however in fact
Proposition. For λ ∈ A and µ ∈ B the bn standard composition multiplicity

       [∆(µ) : L(λ)] =                                                           .
                          0          otherwise

Further, the power of the formal parameter v determines the Loewy layer.
   Proof: The composition multiplicity data is determined in [54, §9]. A table
                                                                                                4


illustrating the computation of the polynomials nA (B) is as follows.

                    3       2       1        0       -1      -2       -3

           1                        1        v


           0                                 1


           -1                                v       1


           -2                       v        v2      v       1                      -


           -3               v       v2     v 3 +v 1+v 2      v        1


The row position in the table gives A and the column position B; and nA0 (A0 ) is
shaded. 2 The table is complete for the rows shown, except the top and bottom
rows. For the top row, the arrows within the table illustrate the contributions to the
n′As from a particular nA (B) (the shaded lines are the relevant walls for reflection
in each case). The arrow outside the table illustrates a required subtraction to
obtain nA in the bottom row (which is complete except for this subtraction). The
pattern is clear, and one sees immediately that the formal procedure reproduces the
multiplicity and layer data. 2
    The case bn (q, 1) contains the ordinary Ringel dual, EndUq sl2 (V2⊗n ), as a quo-
tient. Note that the ordinary Soergel procedure is embedded in this version (in the
‘dominant’ region of case m = 1) accordingly.
    The ‘idempotent splitting’ analysis described in [53] applies in principle in this
situation, giving a heuristic explanation of why Soergel’s procedure is relevant here.
Following this paradigm there are a set of natural generalisations for which an anal-
ogous method should work.
    The ingredients are (in precis, see also [53, 55]):

   I1 A tower of unital algebras An ⊂ An+1 over a ring with indeterminates, and
      a multiplicity-free [66] semisimple specialisation [13] (split, and we will only
      consider characteristic 0 here).
       For a tower as in I1, let BA− denote the Bratteli diagram of the semisimple
       case. Regarded as a set, BA− will here mean the vertex set of this graph.
   2
    The rows and columns, and hence the alcoves, are labelled using Z. These labels should not
be confused with points in the underlying space Z (each alcove contains l − 1 such points) or with
weights.

  I2 (i) A quasi-hereditary global limit via an idempotent e ∈ Am (some m) and
     isomorphisms [28]
                                      eAn+m e ∼
                                              = An                          (1)
      (and hence a tower of recollement [12]). (Exclude consideration of specialisa-
      tions in which e is not well defined.)
      (ii) A map PA from BA− to a global index set Λ, which localises at each
      n to an index set Λ(n) for standard modules ∆(µ) 3 of An (i.e., such that
      Λ(n) ֒→ Λ(n + m) via the full embedding of An –mod in An+m –mod consequent
      on eqn.(1), while ∪˙ n Λ(n) ∼
                                  = BA− ).
      Let Res(µ) ⊂ Λ denote the set of weights of standard factors of the restriction
         A
      ResAn+1
          n
              ∆(µ), and Ind(µ) of the corresponding induction.

  I3 A space V (for definiteness we will assume this is a real Euclidean space)
     and map Λ ֒→ V with the following properties. The convex hull of Res(µ)
     intersects Λ in a subset of {µ} ∪ Ind(µ) ∪ Res(µ) (locality of induction and
     restriction); the set ρµ of reflections in V which fix {µ} and Res(µ) fixes Λ;
     the group W generated by ∪µ ρµ is an affine Weyl group [33, §4.2]; and Λ is a
     subset of the set of point facets in the alcove geometry induced by W on V .

  I4 Control of bases for the algebras and standard modules — including the means
     in principle to compute Gram matrices in the case of indeterminate parame-
     ters.

  I5 Explicit forms for the simplest primitive idempotents (in particular any prim-
     itive and central idempotents).

  I6 A linkage principle [35] — ∆(µ), ∆(ν) are in different blocks if there does
     not exist any w ∈ Wl (Wl a suitably rescaled version of W , depending on the
     specialisation) such that wµ = ν.

1.2     Role and realization of ingredients 1, 2(ii) and 3
Recall [43] (and cf. [41]) the affine Hecke algebra H(n) defined by generators
{1, X, g1 , · · · , gn−1 } and relations

               gigi±1 gi = gi±1 gi gi±1              gi gj = gj gi   i 6= j ± 1          (2)

               g1 Xg1 X = Xg1 Xg1                       gj X = Xgj      j>1.             (3)
                                   (gi − q)(gi + q −1 ) = 0                              (4)
The cyclotomic Hecke algebra [10] H = H(n, d) is the quotient Ψd of H(n) by
                                      d
                                      Y
                                            (X − λi ) = 0.                               (5)
                                      i=1

Here q, λ1, · · · , λd , · · · are parameters, which we may begin by regarding as inde-
terminates. Write A for Z[q, q −1 , λ1 , . . . , λd ] and K for the quotient field. Write
HA (n, d) for H(n, d) over A. This is a free module over A [2] (see §2). The case

   Standard in the quasi–hereditary sense, but we might also hope these modules are ‘nice’ in
some Kazhdan–Lusztig sense [40, 24].
                                                                                             6


d = 2, λ1 = −λ−1 2 is essentially the B–type Hecke algebra (cf. [32, 48]). For any
d′ > d let Ψd : H(n, d′ ) → H(n, d) also denote the quotient by equation(5). Denote
by H(−, d) the sequence of inclusions

                                   H(n, d) ⊂ H(n + 1, d).                                  (6)

    Usually we will fix an A–algebra k which is a field, and which as a field is C,
and consider H(n, d) = HA (n, d) ⊗A k. The semi-simple generic structure of H(n, d)
over C is well known, through that of the specialisation to the group algebra of the
group Zd ≀ Sn (confer [34, 32, 13] as in [2]). We recall it briefly. An integer partition
Pof degree n is a list (µ1 , µ2 , · · ·) of non-negative integers such that µi ≥ µi+1 and
µ
  i µi = n. There is a natural correspondence with Young diagrams of degree n.
Denote by Λn = Λdn the set of ordered lists of d integer partitions, of summed degree
n (called d-partitions of degree n). For example

                  Λ22 = {((2), 0), ((12), 0), ((1), (1)), (0, (2)), (0, (12))}.

The conjugacy classes of Zd ≀ Sn are readily seen to be indexed by Λdn [44, 55], thus
H(n, d) has simple modules ∆µ indexed by µ ∈ Λdn . Similarly the Bratteli diagram
B = BH(−,d) of the natural tower of semi-simple algebras H(−, d) is determined by

                                                    d
                                  H(n+1,d)      MM
                              Res          ∆µ =    ∆µ−eij                                  (7)
                                  H(n,d)
                                                   i=1   j


where the sum over j is over possible subtractions of one box from the ith Young
diagram of µ.
    For each n > 1, there are 2d one dimensional irreducible representations R±l
(l = 1, 2, · · · , d) of H(n, d), given by R±l (X) = λl and R±l (gi ) = ±q ±1 . The rep-
resentation Rl corresponds to the module ∆µ with multipartition µ = (, , µl , , ) in
which all component integer partitions are empty except the lth partition, which is
either (n) (case l > 0) or (1n ) (case l < 0). For each n we may associate an unique
primitive (and central) idempotent to each of these representations, in the algebra
over generic k [31]. We write these idempotents e±l  n . For l ∈ {1, 2, ..., d} the element
e±l
 n  of H(n,   d)   uniquely obeys

 (gi ∓ q ±1 )e±l
              n = 0 (i = 1, 2, · · · , n − 1),      (X − λl )e±l
                                                              n = 0,          (e±l 2   ±l
                                                                                n ) = en . (8)

The inclusion (6) allows us to regard e±l  n as an idempotent in H(n + 1, d), albeit
neither primitive nor central in general. Indeed the idempotent will be expressible
as a sum of primitive idempotents in reciprocity with the rule (7).4
    In §5 of this paper we give explicit formulae for all e±l
                                                           n for all d. For now we will
                                  ±l     ±l
be concerned particularly with e := e2 . The reason for this is the desire for a small
but significant generalisation of the set of dominant weights and the weight spaces
underlying Soergel’s procedure for case Am−1 (i.e. Uq slm ). Although the induction
and restriction rules are straightforward, and satisfy ingredient 1, the ‘weight space’
of H(−, d) (in which distance d(µ, λ) is the minimum number of steps on B from µ

             P µ
    Let 1 =     µe    be the unique decomposition of 1 into primitive central idempotents of
H(n + 1, d). Then e±l
                           P ±l µ
                     n =      µ en e is this decomposition; i.e. it is also unique, even though
the decomposition of 1 into primitive idempotents is not.

to λ) is somewhat unmanageable geometrically, cf. our desired ingredients 2 and 3.
What is wanted is something like an analogue for H(−, d) of the quotients

                                 Hnm ∼
                                     = EndUq slm (Vm⊗n )                               (9)

of the ordinary Hecke algebra Hn . The Bratteli diagram BH− of the ordinary Hecke
algebra is the Young tree, but via (9) the quotients Hnm are the natural incarnations
of the Ringel duals of Am−1 quantum groups, and hence may be associated to the
same weight spaces, and satisfy ingredients 1–6. Let us briefly review this. Let e±
                                                                                  m+1
denote the two primitive and central idempotents of Hm+1 (for simplicity assume
[m + 1]! 6= 0 for now). The Hnm are such that

                       0 −→ Hn e−                m
                                m+1 Hn −→ Hn −→ Hn −→ 0                               (10)

is exact. For [m]! 6= 0 they are quasi–hereditary and satisfy ingredient 2, for example,
through
                                            − ∼
                                   e−   m          m
                                    m Hn+m em = Hn .                                (11)
Let Λ1,m denote the set of Young diagrams of < m rows, regarded as a subset of Zm−1 .
Let v = (1, 1, . . . , 1) ∈ Zm−1 and let Zm−1 /v denote the corresponding quotient set.
Note that the injective map from Zm−2 into Zm−1 given by (µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µm−2 ) 7→
(µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µm−2 , 0) has image a set of representative elements of Zm−1 in Zm−1 /v.
Denote by Pm−1 the corresponding surjective map from Zm−1 to Zm−2 (and also its
restriction to Λ1,m , whose image is Λ1,m−1 ). Note that BH−m , the set of weights for
Hnm for all n, is Λ1,m+1 . In the sense of ingredient 2(ii) the set of isomorphisms (11)
collapses BH−m into Λ1,m , which is the set of dominant weights of slm , via Pm+1 [53].
That is PH m = Pm ; and Λ1,m (n), the index set for Hnm , is the subset of Λ1,m of
diagrams of degree ≤ n and congruent to n modulo m.
    Delightfully, we find that only the n = 2 idempotents are needed for an analogue
of equation(10) for H(n, d) (see also [55]). Denote the sum of the ideals generated
by {e−l2 | all l} by
                                    Dd = Dd (n) := +dl=1 He−l
                                                            2 H

(we will modify this definition very slightly later). Define algebra H D = H D (n, d)
by H D (1, d) = H(1, d) and for n > 1 by exactness of the sequence

                            0 −→ Dd −→ H −→ H D −→ 0.                                 (12)

The idea is to restrict consideration to the subset ΛD of H(−, d)–weights in which
each integer partition is the trivial partition of that degree. Such an H(−, d)–weight
is characterised by a sequence of d non-negative integers, i.e. the degrees of the
component integer partitions (in this way we have an action of Pd on ΛD ). This
sequence need not be ordered as an integer partition, and hence the set of such
weights maps onto the set of all weights of Ad−1 (i.e. not just the usual dominant
weights). For example with d = 3, the weight ((2), (4), (3)) becomes (2, 4, 3), and
                                                                                         8

this last, note, being the weight set used in §1.1. Note that ∆µ ∈ H−mod is also
in H D −mod if and only if µ ∈ ΛD (in which case, as an H D –module we write it
∆(Pd (µ))). To see this note, from (7), that the restriction of ∆µ to n = 2 contains
a copy of one of the excluded one dimensional modules (not necessarily a direct
summand in general) if and only if µ contains at least one integer partition with a
second part (i.e. a Young diagram with a second row).
    By construction then, the tower H D (−, d) has ingredients 1, 3 (restriction is
local via (7) and induction via Frobenius reciprocity) and, at least formally, the
final part of 2. Of course the construction is most interesting if it can be made to
include non–semisimple specialisations (else the fundamental alcove of §1.1 is the
whole weight space and the Soergel procedure is trivial). In the remainder of this
paper we address ingredients 2, 4, 5 and 6 from this point of view. In particular we
identify the d = 2 case with the blob algebra. This has useful implications for all
d > 2. Note that, fixing k, there are a number of distinct ways to impose a quotient
relation of the form of Ψd on H(n, d′ ), corresponding to the choice of factors to
remove in the strengthening of the relation (5). For λ′ = (λ1 , λ2 , ..., λd′ ) and λ any
subsequence of this of length d′ − d let Ψλd denote the strengthening by omission of
                                                       (λ )
the factors (X − λi ) with λi in λ. The quotient Ψd i commutes with the quotient
to H D so
                                                   (λ )
Proposition. Fixing k, there are d + 1 ways (Ψd i , i = 1, 2, .., d + 1) to quotient to
pass from H D (n, d + 1) to H D (n, d) (n > 0).
                                                                                       (λ )
    Returning to the example of d = 3, we see that as n varies the image of Ψ2 i
sweeps out a 2π/3 radian arc of weight space (there will be a picture illustrating
this in section 5.2), with the union of these arcs over i = 1, 2, 3 giving the complete
space. If k gives a non–semisimple specialisation then, as we will see, there is at
least one i such that the corresponding tower of blob (i.e. d = 2) algebras is critical
(in the sense of [52, 54], or §1.1), i.e. it has one or more reflection points. As n
varies a given d = 2 reflection point sweeps out a straight line in this arc in d = 3
weight space (see §5.2 for details). This is then a reflection line of the d = 3 alcove
geometry, to which the Soergel procedure may be applied.
    Our approach to ingredient 2 is through representation theory, and the last part
of the paper addresses this. It includes a ‘walk though’ review of some earlier work
                                                                                            9


in statistical mechanics which explains our approach to this problem, and concludes
by defining certain representations of bn (and H D (n, d)) which are candidates for
‘tensor space’ representations (i.e. they would establish ingredient 2 if faithful, see
§6 — the question of faithfulness is not resolved here).


2     Preliminaries
Let involution t : Z[q, q −1 ] → Z[q, q −1 ] be given by t(q) = −q −1 ; and let s act on
Z[λ1 , · · · , λd ] by permuting the indices on the {λi } cyclically. Let [n] = q n−1 +q n−3 +
· · · + q 1−n .
      For A an algebra, let Z(A) denote the centre of A; and for B ⊆ A let ZB (A)
denote the centralizer of B in A (so ZB (A) ⊇ Z(A) and ZA (A) = Z(A)).
(2.1) For a = (a1 , a2 , · · · , an ) an n–tuple of natural numbers, the Weyl orbit of a
in Nn is the orbit of the Sn action permuting indices. Let Y = (Y1 , ..., Yn ) be an
n–tuple of variables in some commutative ring R. Define
                                              n
                                              Y
                                       Ya =         Yiai
                                              i=1

and the monomial symmetric polynomial (see e.g. [23])
                                        X ′
                              (Y a )Σ =    Ya
                                                 a′

where the sum is over all elements in the Weyl orbit of a.
(2.2) Let R be a unique factorisation domain, A a free R–module with basis A, and
K the field of fractions of R. Consider any e ∈ A ⊗R K and let ae ∈ A be such
that e = ae e ∈ A ⊂ A ⊗R K. If there exists an ae such that the coefficient of some
a ∈ A in e is 1, then ae and e are unique with this property up to a unit. If A
is an R–algebra and e and idempotent, call such an e a preidempotent, and ae the
corresponding normalisation of e.
    Now let R above be A, and consider A as a collection of C–algebras by specialisa-
tion. We say that a property holds generically if it holds on an (Zariski) open subset
of parameter space, and that it holds usually if the condition for failure to hold may
be expressed as a single finite polynomial in a single variable (e.g. [2] is generically
and usually invertible, (q 2 λ1 − λ2 ) is generically but not usually invertible).
    Let e = ae′ be any explicit expression for an element in A over K as above. For
              e
any point x in parameter space (i.e. any k) there is an open region with x in its
closure in which the polynomial a′e has no root, so e may be evaluated as a limit at
k. This process does not guarantee a unique finite limit. However, if e is a primitive
and central idempotent then any two finite limits must be the same, since they will
have the properties of a unique primitive and central idempotent in A over k. (I.e.,
they will induce the same simple projective module, Ae ⊗ k.)
(2.3) Let σi denote the elementary transposition σi = (i i + 1) ∈ Sn , so σi (i) = i + 1
and so on [31]. Let Bn be a maximal set of inequivalent reduced words in the
generators {g1 , ..., gn−1} of Hn . For each w ∈ Bn note that there is a natural
(reduced expression for an) element of Sn associated to it by substituting gi ; σi .
                                                                                               10


(2.4) Let
                        X1 := X                             Xj := gj−1 Xj−1gj−1               (13)
so in H(n)
                                               [Xj , Xk ] = 0                                 (14)
                                  [Xj , gk ] = 0            j 6= k, k + 1                     (15)
                             −1                                                      −1
 gk Xk+1 = Xk gk + (q − q )Xk+1                                 gk Xk = Xk+1gk − (q − q )Xk+1 (16)
and so
                            [Xk + Xk+1 , gk ] = [Xk Xk+1 , gk ] = 0.                          (17)
Now
         Xkj + Xk+1
                j
                    = (Xkj−1 + Xk+1
                                j−1
                                    )(Xk + Xk+1) − (Xkj−2 + Xk+1
                                                             j−2
                                                                 )Xk Xk+1
so
                                              [gi , (X a )Σ ] = 0
for all i and any a.
(2.5) Let X Σ denote the algebra of symmetric polynomials in the Xi s. Evidently
X Σ ⊆ Z(H(n)), and in fact Bernstein has noted that this is an equality (see ap-
pendix).
(2.6) It follows from equations (14 – 16) that any product of generators of H(n, d)
can be expressed as a Z[q, q −1 , λ1 , . . . , λd ]-linear combination of words from the set
                       Cdn = {X a w | a ∈ {0, 1, · · · , d − 1}n , w ∈ Bn }
The dimension of this spanning set is clearly dn n!, which is also the dimension of
H(n, d), thus
Proposition. [2] The set Cdn is a basis for H(n, d).
   Linearly extend s and t to act on H(n, d), fixing Cdn pointwise.
(2.7) Proposition. [55] Let B be a basis for H(n − 1, d), D a basis for < X > and
G = g1 g2 ...gn−1 . Then
             {aGb, g1 aGb, g2 g1 aGb, · · · , gn−1 · · · g2 g1 aGb | a ∈ D, b ∈ B}
is a basis for H(n, d).
                                            2n−2
(2.8) Fix d and set pln =
                              Q
                                  i6=1 (q  λl − λi ). Note that
                                          n
                                                            !

3     Standard modules and linkage
The generators and relations in equations(2) (and inverses) define the ordinary braid
group An –braid. Denote by Bn –braid the extension by g0 = X (and inverse) obey-
ing equations(3) (cf. [32, 49] and references therein). Thus H(n) is a quotient of
CBn –braid by the quadratic relation in equation(4).
    One realization of Bn –braid is as the group of braids on the cylinder, with g0
becoming the pure braid in which the first string passes over all the other strings
and then around the cylinder. There is a natural ‘Young’ embedding Bn –braid ×
Bm –braid ֒→ Bn+m –braid. One places the second cylinder concentrically inside the
first, then allows the two cylinders to converge in such a way that the nodes of
Bn –braid, respectively Bm –braid, remain consecutive on the edges of the cylinder
(while of course preserving over/under information). There is a corresponding em-
bedding H(n) × H(m) ֒→ H(n + m). The construction of ‘standard’ modules (in the
sense of [11, 58]) follows from this. The quotient Ψd complicates this, in that the
spectrum of Xn+1 (the image of (1, X1 )) is not that of X1 (the image of (X1 , 1)).
(3.1) Let hXi i denote the commutative subalgebra hXi | i = 1, . . . , ni ⊆ H(n, d).
Generically, as we will see, we may determine P              a unique basis of primitive (and
of course central) idempotents ǫx of hXi i with x ǫx = 1. There will be certain
specialisations where this basis will not make sense (certain idempotents will have
preidempotents with vanishing normalisation). In any case, any primitive idempo-
tent decomposition of 1 in H(n, d) will be different, but the unique primitive central
idempotent decomposition of 1 in H(n, d) will be expressible as a crudification of the
above (albeit depending on k). The generic case will be the least crude (one idem-
potent per block/isomorphism class of simples); and it will be necessary, formally,
to combine certain of these generic idempotents (into non–simple blocks) to make
idempotents which make sense over k in non–semisimple cases. Each ǫx must obey
Xi ǫx = xi ǫx with xi some scalar. (Thus each induces a left H–module Πx := Hǫx .
Since the Hn subalgebra of H(n) maps isomorphically to its image in the quotient
we have Hǫx = Hn ǫx , of rank n!.)                    Q
     Evidently x1 ∈ {λi }, and with πj := i6=j (X − λi ) we have Xπj = Q                λj πj and
πj ǫx ∝ ǫx . For each such πj there exists aQminimal polynomial πj,− (X2 ) = k (X2 −
λj,k ) such that πj πj,− = 0. Set πj,k = l6=k (X2 − λj,l ) and ǫ. (j,k) = πj πj,k . Then
X2 ǫ. (j,k) = λj,k ǫ. (j,k) . For each ǫ. (j,k) there exists a polynomial πj,k,− (X3 ) such that
πj πj,k πj,k,− = 0, and so on. That is, the roots of such a polynomial are certain of
the eigenvalues of the Xi s.
     We can work out these eigenvalues of the Xi s by looking at the properties of
generically irreducible representations as given in §1.2. Let µ ∈ Λdn . A ‘standard’
insertion of n = {1, 2, .., n} into the boxes of µ is one such that deletion of the boxes
containing {l, .., n} produces a legitimate p-partition for every l. Let Tµ denote the
set of all such standard insertions. For i ∈ n and w ∈ Tµ there is a k ∈ {1, 2, .., d}
such that i appears in a box in the k th partition in w. Define w(i) = k. It will be
evident from the restriction rule (7) that Tµ may be used as a basis for ∆µ , once
equipped with a suitable action.
(3.2) Proposition. The action of the Xi s on this basis may be taken to be lower
                                                                      i
triangular, with diagonal element of Xi on w ∈ Tµ given by λw(i) q 2w where w i is the
distance of i off the main diagonal in the w(i)th partition in µ (with distances below
the diagonal being negative).
                                                                                           12


Proof: In case n = 1 the claim holds since Ri (X) = λi . Suppose the claim is true at
level n − 1. Then the eigenvalues for X1 , .., Xn−1 at level n are given by restriction
using
   P the rule (7). The eigenvalues for Xn may be determined using the centrality
of i Xi etc.. 2
(3.3) Let vi denote the ith elementary vector in Zd . Describe a walk on Zd (or
Zd /(1, 1, .., 1)) by word w = w1 w2 ... in d such that the vector between      the ith and
                                                                                l
i + 1st site visited is vwi . For given word w define #l (i) = #w
                                                                             P
                                                                     l (i) =    j=1 δwj ,i . A
reflection hyperplane (i, j; x) is characterised by a pair vi , vj (i 6= j ∈ d) not parallel
to it, and the signed distance x in the direction of vi of this hyperplane from 0 (i.e.
the x such that 0 + xvi lies on it). A walk touches this hyperplane at l if

                                    #l (i) − #l (j) = x.                                 (18)

Let w be a walk which touches hyperplane (i, j; x) at l. The walk w ′ got from w by
applying permutation (ij) to every wt t > l is called the (affine) reflection of w in
(i, j; x) at l (NB, the touching point l is not in general uniquely defined by w and
(i, j; x); or indeed existent). Every point of the reflection after l is the reflection of
this point in (i, j; x) in the usual alcove geometry sense (see [49, Ch.7]).
     If w ′ meets another (not necessarily distinct) hyperplane (k, m; y) at l′ > l then
of course w meets the image of (k, m; y) in (i, j; x) at the same moment. If w ′′ is
the reflection of w ′ in (k, m; y) at l′ then we say w, w ′, w ′′ in the same walk orbit of
the reflection group generated by these hyperplanes (the ith points of these walks
are in the same orbit in the usual sense, for each i). We may think of folding up
the space along the set of hyperplanes in the group — the walk orbits are the sets
of walks which are mapped into each other by this folding. For G a reflection group
generated by hyperplanes we write w ∼G w ′ if walks w, w ′ in the same walk orbit of
G. Each hyperplane partitions space into two parts (not counting the hyperplane
itself). The ‘outside’ of the hyperplane (i, j; x), x 6= 0, is the part not containing 0.
     We will restrict attention to hyperplanes not touching 0. Note that for each walk
w from 0 which finishes at a point µ outside some hyperplane there is not in general
a unique walk in its orbit which finishes at the image point of µ, inside it. The
orbit structure of walks is more complicated than that of points. For example, the
endpoints of elements of the same walk orbit are necessarily in the same point orbit;
but the converse does not follow. Further, a walk which stays in the interior of the
fundamental alcove is in a singleton orbit; and more generally a walk which touches
hyperplanes a total of t times has 2t elements in its orbit (see figure 1 and figure 2).
     For G a reflection group generated by a set of reflection hyperplanes S let S ⊂ G
denote the set of simple reflections. It will be convenient to confuse these reflections
with the corresponding hyperplanes, noting that S ⊃ S in general. In particular we
may now compose hyperplanes by conjugation in G, i.e. (i, j; x) ◦ (j, k; y) = (i, k; x+
y) and so on. Let A′ ⊂ A consist of those elements of the form (λi −q −2x λj ), all i, j, x.
Define the factor set of G, F (G) ⊂ A′ such that (i, j; x) ∈ S iff (λi −q −2x λj ) ∈ F (G).
The elements of F (G) are called factors. Note that there is an equality of ideals
                       X                         X
                             A(λi − q −2x λj ) =       A(λi − q −2x λj )               (19)
                    (i,j;x)∈S                   (i,j;x)∈S


since the composition of hyperplanes above corresponds to the addition (up to a
unit) of factors.

Figure 1: Eight walks in a walk orbit for d = 3 (origin in the bottom left hand
corner, endpoints circled).

   For a walk w of length n let µ(w) = (#n (1), #n (2), ..), an ordered partition of n.
To each walk w of length n associate an element λw ∈ An as follows:

                                   (λw )i = λwi q 2(#i (wi )−1) .

For example λ3331312 = (λ3 , λ3 q 2 , λ3 q 4 , λ1 , λ3 q 6 , λ1 q 2 , λ2 ).
   NB, This λ− gives an injective map from ∪µ∈ΛD (n) Tµ into An .
(3.4) Proposition. (i) Let w ′ be the reflection of w in (i, j; x) at l, then every
                                  ′
non–zero element of λw − λw is of the form ±q 2α (λi − q −2x λj ) (some α ∈ Z). (NB,
no mention of l in the implication.)
                                                              ′
     (ii) Let w, w ′ be two walks. If every element of λw −λw is divisible by (λi −q −2x λj )
then w, w ′ are related by one (or more) reflection in (i, j; x) for some l (resp. l <
l′ < l′′ ...).
     (iii) Let G be the group generated by a set of simple reflections {(i, j; x), (k, l; y), ..}.
Walks w, w ′ are in the same walk orbit of G (i.e. related by a sequence of reflections
                                                                  ′
in hyperplanes in G) if and only if each non–zero (λw − λw )i is divisible by an ele-
ment of F (G).
Proof: (i) Consider the first point at which w and w ′ differ, which we may take to be
                                               ′           w                  w′
   ′
wl+1    = (ij)wl+1 = j. We have (λw − λw )l+1 = λi q 2(#l+1 (i)−1) − λj q 2(#l+1 (j)−1) . Now
                                w′          w′
#w              w
   l+1 (i) = #l (i) + 1 and #l+1 (j) = #l (j) + 1, so, cf. equation(18), the exponents
differ by 2x as required. Since subsequent points k with wk 6= wk′ are all those at
which {wk , wk′ } ∩ {i, j} =6 ∅ the difference in exponents is preserved.
     (ii) is a special case of (iii).
                                                                    ′
     (iii) (Only if part) Note that, by construction, (λw − λw )i is, up to a unit, an
element of A′ . Each pair w ∼G w ′ may be related by a series of simple reflections:
                                                                                  14

                                                         i          i+1
w ∼G w ′′ ∼G .. ∼G w ′ , and eachP   intermediate (λw − λw )i is of the required form
                              ′             i     i+1
by (i). Evidently (λw − λw )i = i (λw − λw )i . Now confer equation(19).
     (if part) Let w|m denote the first m steps in walk w. Fix w and consider w ′ such
that w 6∼G w ′. Suppose that point m is the first at which w|m 6∼G w ′|m . Let w̃|m−1 =
w ′ |m−1 and w̃m be such that w|m ∼G w̃|m . Thus w̃|m is a reflection of w ′ |m in some
                                                   ′
hyperplane h at m − 1, with h 6∈ G. Thus λw − λw̃ = (0, 0, .., 0, (q 2α(λi − q −2x λj )))
for some α, i, j, x, where i 6= j since w ′ and w̃ agree at m − 1. The non–zero factor is
                                                               ′                          ′
not a factor of F (G) since h 6∈ G. Now consider λw − λw = (λw − λw̃ ) + (λw̃ − λw ).
The mth element of the first summand on the right is divisible by some f ∈ F (G) by
the only if part, while that of the second summand is not, by the above argument.
Thus the LHS is not. 2
     For example, consider the sequences 333, 331 and 321 with λ333 = (λ3 , q 2 λ3 , q 4 λ3 ),
λ331 = (λ3 , q 2 λ3 , λ1 ) and λ321 = (λ3 , λ2 , λ1 ). We have (3, 1; 2)333 = 331 and
(3, 2; 1)331 = 321 and λ333 − λ321 = (0, q 2(λ3 − q −2 λ2 ), q 4 (λ3 − q −4 λ1 )).
(3.5) Proposition. For each w ∈ ∪µ∈ΛD (n) Tµ there is an element ǫ. w of hXi i as
described above obeying
                             Xi ǫ. w = (λw )i ǫ. w .

Proof: For a d-partition µ of form ((µ1 ), (µ2), ..) (i.e. µ ∈ ΛD ) and w ∈ Tµ identified
with the corresponding word w we have wi = w(i) and #i (wi ) = w i . Now cf.
proposition 3.2. 2
    Let Rx denote the representation of hXi i corresponding to any ǫ. x as above. It
follows that the hXi i–simple character of ResH  hXi i (∆ν ) is


                               [ResH
                                   hXi i (∆ν ) : Rw ] = δµ(w),ν .                        (20)

NB, this is not a unique characterisation unless:
Cor. If k is generic, i.e. λ− remains injective on passing from An to (A ⊗ k)n , then
Rw ∼
   = Rw′ implies w = w ′ and hXi iD ⊂ H D has enough simples to be semisimple.
(3.6) We define G(k), the reflection group induced by k as follows. For each triple
(i, j; x) such that (λi − q 2x λj ) ⊗ k = 0 include the hyperplane (i, j; x) as a generator.
Note that this is sensible in as much as (i, j; x) ◦ (j, k; y) = (i, k; x + y) while λi −
q 2x λj = 0 and λj − q 2y λk = 0 imply λi − q 2(x+y) λk = 0. If d′ of the parameters
{λi } are related in this way then the group generated is Sd′ , unless q is a root of
unity, in which case it is the affine extension. We will usually refer to the group as
affine Weyl group regardless, to emphasize the fact that even in the finite case the
hyperplanes do not pass through 0. That is, we exclude from consideration any k
in which λi = λj does not imply i = j.
Proposition. Over k, Rw ∼        = Rw′ iff w, w ′ are in the same walk orbit of the affine
Weyl group induced by k (i.e. related by a some series of reflections).
                                                  ′
Proof: There is an isomorphism iff λw − λw vanishes over k. Every term is of the
form q α (λi − q 2x λj ). Now apply proposition (3.4).
(3.7) Proposition. [Linkage] If there exists a nontrivial homomorphism ∆µ → ∆ν
over k then µ, ν lie in the same orbit of the affine Weyl group induced by k.
                                                                                              16


Proof:
                                     ∆µ                     /   ∆ν
                                          Res   ⇓                    Res
                               P                       P        
                                  w∈Tµ     Rw       /
                                                        w∈Tν          Rw

Now apply ((3.6) Proposition). 2
    Note that this strengthens immediately to exclude interorbit maps from any
submodule of ∆µ to any quotient of ∆ν , i.e. µ 6∼G(k) ν implies ∆µ , ∆ν have no
composition factors in common. Thus, under the assumption that every simple
occurs in {Head(∆µ ) | µ ∈ ΛD }, as for a quasi–hereditary algebra, we have linkage
in the form of I6.
(3.8) Proposition. Let w, w ′ ∈ ∪µ∈ΛD (n) Tµ be reflections of each other in (i, j; x)
at any l. Then over any k in which (λi − q 2x λj ) vanishes we have an isomorphism
of left H–modules
                                  Hǫw ∼= Hǫw′ .

Proof: By ((3.6) Proposition) ǫ. w and ǫ. w′ induce isomorphic hXi i–modules. 2
(3.9) Given the injectivity of λ− it will be convenient to be able to refer to a walk w
either directly or via its image λw . This unifies the labelling schemes for ǫw in (3.1)
and (3.5).
    Note that Rx (πj ) = 0 for all Rx except those with x1 = λj . Let Sj be the set
                                                                         2      −2
of possibleQvalues of Rx (X2 ) when x1 = λj (i.e. Sj =     Q{λk 6= λj , q λj , q λj }). Then
R(λj ,x2 ,..)( s∈Sj (X2 − s)) = 0 for any such x, and πj s∈Sj (X2 − s) lies in the radical
of hXi i, and hence some power of it vanishes. This tells us, up to multiplicity, the
roots of πj,− , and hence of the preidempotent πj πj,k (obtained by omitting a factor
(X2 − λj,k ), λj,k ∈ Sj , from πj πj,− ). If λ− is injective then the radical is {0} and all
the roots can be distinguished. Iterating this argument we have
Proposition. For w a walk

    Note that unless the omitted factor in πj or πj,k coincides (under X1 ↔ X2 ) with
a factor in the other, then the product πj πj,k is automatically in Z(H(2, d)) (simply

multiply in all the factors apparently required for symmetry, then replace these with
scalars using the eigenvector property — the excluded cases are those where one or
more such scalar vanishes).
     For example, in case n = 2, d = 2 hXi i has rank 6. We have (X − λ2 )(X2 −
q λ1 )(X2 − q 2 λ1 )(X2 − λ2 ) = 0 so, for example, ǫ. 11 = ǫ. λ1 ,q2 λ1 = (X − λ2 )(X2 −

q −2 λ1 )(X2 − λ2 ) is a preidempotent with X2 ǫ. λ1 ,q2 λ1 = q 2 λ1 ǫ. λ1 ,q2 λ1 ; while ǫ. λ1 λ2 =
(X − λ2 )(X2 − q −2 λ1 )(X2 − q 2 λ1 ) is a preidempotent with Xi ǫ. λ1 λ2 = λi ǫ. λ1 λ2 . The
preidempotent ǫλ1 ,q2 λ1 lies in Z(H) (provided q 2 6= 1) since it can be symmetrized:
(X1 − q −2 λ1 )ǫ. λ1 ,q2 λ1 = (λ1 − q −2 λ1 )ǫ. λ1 ,q2 λ1 . On the other hand, ǫ. λ1 λ2 cannot be
rescaled to its symmetrized   Q form because the 2symmetrizing        −2

                                                                         factor
     For H(2, d) we have j6=1(X − λj )(X2 − q λ1 )(X2 − q λ1 ) j6=1 (X2 − λj ) = 0,
so similar considerations apply. Indeed they do for all n. In particular ǫ. 11..1 ∈ Z(H)
unless q 2 = 1. More generally, we may proceed as follows.
(3.10) For µ an ordered partition of n let Hµ denote the corresponding Young sub-
algebra of Hn ⊂ H(n, d). For w a walk let ew ∈ Hn denote the q–Young symmetrizer
[14] [25, §9.3] associated to Hµ(w) . A walk w is said to be sorted if it takes the form
111..22.. (more precisely, if wi ≤ wi+1 for all consecutive pairs of steps in w). There
is a unique sorted walk in each Tµ , denoted w(µ). A walk w is said to be direct if
all steps in a given direction are taken consecutively (thus a sorted walk is direct).
Proposition. For w sorted, and (1 + q 2 ) and each λi invertible, ǫ. w commutes with
Hµ(w) .
Proof: Let µt denote the tth interval of {1, 2, .., n} in the ordered paritition µ(w),
i.e. the tth set of integers fixed under the action of the Young subgroup Sµ(w) of
Sn on {1, 2, .., n}. We require to show, for each t, that the factors in ǫ. w involving
Xµt := {Xi | i ∈ µt } constitute a symmetric polynomial in these variables, and hence
commute with the tth factor algebra in Hµ(w) (the remaining factor algebras commute
with these variables by equation(15)). Our walk is of the form w = 111..22..tt.., and
the factors in question are (by ((3.9) proposition)) those written out explicitly in:
                            d            t−1
                                                                                 !

(where Xa is the first Xi in Xµt ). It will be apparent that this is rendered symmetric
by multiplying by (Xa − q −2 λt ), but (Xa − q −2 λt )ǫ. w = (λt − q −2 λt )ǫ. w so it is already
symmetric provided that (1 − q −2 )λt is invertible. 2
   A similar property holds for direct walks.
(3.11) Proposition. If w takes the form 111..22.. then ǫw ew = ew ǫw (and similarly
for the preidempotent forms ǫ. and e). The modules ∆µ(w) = Hew ǫ. w are the left
standard modules of H with these weights.
Proof: Note that ew ∈ Hµ(w) and apply ((3.10) proposition).
(3.12) Write µ ≥ ν if every change of direction in w(µ) occurs at the same step as
one in w(ν) (NB, w(ν) may have changes at other points as well). Note that µ ≥ ν
implies ew(µ) ew(ν) = ew(µ) , and hence ew(µ) ew(ν) = κν ew(µ) for some κν ∈ A.
Proposition. Suppose that w(µ) ∼G(k) w(ν), and µ ≥ ν, and κν ⊗ k 6= 0. Then
∆µ ֒→ ∆ν .

Proof:

       ∆µ = Hew(µ) ǫ. w(µ) = Hew(µ) ew(ν) ǫ. w(µ) ֒→ Hew(ν) ǫ. w(µ) ∼
                                                                    = Hew(ν) ǫ. w(ν) = ∆ν .

    A remark is in order on denominators and idempotent decompositions of 1. The
idempotent decomposition of 1 = e+2           +1
                                       1 + e1 ∈ H(1, 2) is not defined in case λ1 = λ2
over k, and the radical rad(H(1, 2)) = ke+1    1 . Obviously R±1 = R±2 for any n in
this case. The decomposition of 1 = (e+2    1  + e+1                   −2   −1
                                                  1 ) + e((1),(1)) + (e1 + e1 ) ∈ H(2, 2)
thus has the same limitation — the bracketed sums do not split. Similarly when
q = −q −1 we have R+i = R−i (any n). More interesting is the case λ2 = q 2 λ1 . Here
both e−2         +1                                                    2
        2 and e2 are undefined. Clearly R+1 6= R−2 (unless q = −1, λi = 0) so
e−2      +1                          +2       −1                         −2  +1
 2 + e2 is also undefined, but e2 and e2 are well–defined so e2 + e2 + e((1),(1))
does not split and R+1 ,R−2 (i.e. ∆((2),) and ∆(,(12 )) ) both must be composition
factors of ∆((1),(1)) . NB, at first site this seems problematic for our proposed H D
weight space, however over this k we may identify R−2 with the simple head of
∆((1),(1)) and label it accordingly (rather than by its H(n, d) label, which is (, (12 ))).
This is a good paradigm for the subtleties with labels in realising ingredient 2(ii)
(cf. [56]). In terms of the A1 integral weight set Z ⊂ R (recall P2 ((, (2))) = −2,
P2 (((1), (1))) = 0, P2 (((2), )) = 2) we depict the standard modules and morphism
by:



                             -2                 0                 2

(4.2) It will be convenient to note the equality
                                  (X − λ2 )(−λ1 Σ + Π) = 0                                (25)
and its s image; and hence that
                                                              g1 − q
                       (−λ1 Σ + Π)e−2
                                   2 = (−λ1 Σ + Π)                                        (26)
                                                             −q −1 − q
and s image.
(4.3) Now consider the algebras H D (n, 2) obtained by quotienting by e−1    2   = 0,
 −2
e2 = 0.
    First consider n = 2. A basis of the ideal D2 (2) is simply {e−1   −2
                                                                  2 , e2 } (λ1 6= λ2 ).
The basis C22 of H(2, 2) is
                      {1, X1 , X2 , X1 X2 , g1, X1 g1 , X2 g1 , X1 X2 g1 }.
We can think of using the relation e−22 = 0 to eliminate X1 X2 g1 , and then using its
s-partner to eliminate g1 , to obtain a basis for H D (2, 2) (see also §5.3). Specifically,
it is convenient to represent the quotient relations as
 (X1 + X2 − (λ1 + λ2 ))(g1 − q) = 0                        (X1 X2 − λ1 λ2 )(g1 − q) = 0. (27)
N.B. These two relations generate the same ideal.
   Alternatively, rewriting gi − q =: ui (so u2i = −(q + q −1 )ui ) and X − λ1 =: v we
have
    vu1vu1 = (λ1 q −1 − λ2 q)vu1                        u1 vu1 v = (λ1 q −1 − λ2 q)u1 v   (28)
and similarly for the image under s. Combining (or by applying (g1 − q) to (27i)
from the left) we obtain
                             u1 vu1 = (λ1 q −1 − λ2 q)u1                    (29)
(and s image).
                                                                                                20


4.2     H D (n, 2) and the blob algebra
The blob algebra bn [52] may be defined by generators {e− , U1 , U2 , ..., Un−1 } and
relations e− e− = e− , Ui Ui = −[2]Ui ,

                                        Ui Ui±1 Ui = Ui ,                                     (30)

                                        U1 e− U1 = ye U1 ,                                    (31)
generators commute otherwise, and q, ye are parameters.5 (The ordinary Temperley–
Lieb algebra Tn (q) is the subalgebra generated by the Ui s.) The properties I1–6 are
established for the blob algebra in [54].
    There is a ‘good’ parameterisation of bn by q and m, where ye = − [m−1]  [m]
                                                                                 . In
this parameterisation it is convenient to replace e− by the rescaled generator U0 =
−[m]e− , or rather to replace e− with U0 , with relations U02 = −[m]U0 and

                                     U1 U0 U1 = [m − 1]U1 .                                   (32)

The variant with these relations is isomorphic to the original except (obviously)
when [m] = 0.
(4.4) Proposition. Let m, q, λ1 , λ2 be such that

                           [m − 1](λ1 − λ2 ) = (λ1 q −1 − λ2 q)[m]

(NB, λ1 6= λ2 unless q 2 = 1 and m → ∞, or [m] = 0; otherwise, putting λλ12 = q −2r
                                      qm
then m = r — we may take λ1 = q−q       −1 , then λ1 − λ2 = [m]). Then there is an

isomorphism
                                 φ : H D (n, 2) → bn
given by φ(ui ) = Ui and φ(v) = U0 . There is a homomorphism ψ : bn → H D (n, 2)
given by ψ(Ui ) = ui , ψ(U0 ) = v.
Proof: It is straightforward to verify the cyclotomic Hecke relations under φ. A
direct calculation also shows that the image under φ of the numerator of e−2       2 , as in
equation (23), vanishes identically if we use the form of λ1 given in the proposition.
The image of e−1  2 vanishes similarly. Thus φ is a surjective homomorphism (except
possibly when q 2 = 1). A dimension count reveals that this surjective map is
generically an isomorphism.
    For ψ, equation(29) verifies relation(32). It is now enough to check u1 u2 u1 = u1
(i.e., in H(3, 2), u1 u2 u1 − u1 = u1 (u2 u1 − 1) = [3]!e−
                                                         3 ∈ D2 ). Write f = u1 u2 u1 − u1
and consider f D2 f (if f ∈ D2 then f ∈ f D2 f , at least if [3]! is invertible, and this is
a much smaller and simpler object to work with). This (pre)idempotent subalgebra
includes
                f (X1 + X2 − (λ1 + λ2 ))f = f ((1 + q −2 )X − (λ1 + λ2 ))f
                       f (X1 X2 − λ1 λ2 )f = f (−q −1 Xg1 X − λ1 λ2 )f
and

 f Xg1g2 (X1 + X2 − (λ1 + λ2 ))f = f (Xg1g2 X + Xg1g2 g1 Xg1 − Xg1 g2 (λ1 + λ2 ))f

     The blob algebra is usually defined in terms of a basis of decorated Temperley–Lieb diagrams
(hence its name). That the presentation here is equivalent may be verified by a straightforward (if
tedious) generalisation of the corresponding exercise for the ordinary Temperley–Lieb algebra as
in [49].

= f (−q −1 Xg1 X+Xg2 g1 g2 Xg1 −q −2 (λ1 +λ2 )X)f = f (−(q −1 +q −3 )Xg1 X−q −2 (λ1 +λ2 )X)f
A linear combination of these is

                            [3]!((1 + q −4 )λ1 λ2 − q −2 (λ21 + λ22 ))f

so f ∈ f D2 f at least in an open subset of parameter space. The coefficient may be
rewritten [3]!q −2 λ1 λ2 (q − q −1 )2 [m + 1][m − 1] so this covers most interesting cases.
The remainder require a more tedious calculation. 2
Corollary. The finite characteristic bn decomposition matrices in [15] are a subset
of type–B Hecke decomposition matrices via the correspondence in §1.2.
(4.5) Recall that m = ±1 implies the existence of a quotient algebra isomorphic
to the Temperley–Lieb algebra (in addition to the noted T–L subalgebra). The
quotient identifies X = 1 (or q 2 ).

    We work by induction on j, with the example above as base. Firstly note that
e+1   +1
 j+1 ej   = e+1   +1      +1
               j ej+1 = ej+1 so, from proposition 2.7, equation(36) gives a correct
form for the R+1 idempotent up to coefficients. Then note that in this form it is
sufficient, cf. equation (8), to check the identity (gj − q)e+1
                                                             j+1 = 0, and normalisation
(i.e. idempotency). The former is a direct calculation, and the later may be checked
by evaluating in R+1 , i.e. substituting q for gi and λ1 for X (in which case e+1
                                                                               j+1 must

    By inspection of these idempotents we see that the algebras will not be generic in
specialisations in which λλji = q 2r for some i, j, r ∈ N; and in certain specialisations
in which q is a root of unity (this also follows immediately from [1, 56]). Let us
disregard, for the moment, the cases in which X is degenerate or non-invertible.
Then noting that rescaling all the λi s by the same factor produces an isomorphic
algebra we can fix λ1 = 1 (say) and adopt as parameters q, λλ1i [56]. It is illuminating
to proceed by example (and cf. [55, §5]).

5.2        The case d = 3
The primitive and central idempotents corresponding to the six one-dimensional
representations of H(n, 3) may be constructed as follows. Fixing d = 3, define
Pn = Pn+1 and Pn±i as in equation (33). For example P1 = P1±1 = (λ1 − λ2 )(λ1 − λ3 ),
P2 = q[2](q 2 λ1 − λ2 )(q 2 λ1 − λ3 ).

    Given these results, let us consider the generalised Soergel procedure for d = 3
corresponding to that in §1.1 for d = 2. For illustration we consider a field k in which
the equations λλ1i = q −ni (i = 2, 3) and λλ13 = q −n1 are solved for positive integer ni
only in case n2 = 2, n3 = 4 (in particular, in this instance q is not a root of unity).
Figure 3 illustrates the location of the corresponding reflection hyperplanes (shown
as thick lines) in the H D , i.e. A2 , weight space. The Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials
for this geometry are given in the figure at [55, p.1289]. The claim, then, is that if µ
is a weight in the fundamental alcove A0 (such as 0) then ∆(µ) has simple content
(and Loewy structure)
                                             Lµ
                                     Lµ.s          Lµ.t

                                           Lµ.sts
(here s and t are the walls of A0 — we are abusing the notation A.s of §1.1 to apply
to weights in the obvious way). Of course, localising at small n, some of these simple
modules will vanish. Let us consider n = 0, 1, 2, 3.
     (For any k) we have H D (0, 3) ∼= k, with basis {1}. The weight for the correspond-
ing simple module is the innermost dot in the figures (marked  P3(, , )+i
                                                                       in figure 3(a)). For
   D                           +i
H (1, 3), the idempotents e1 are all well defined and 1 = i=1 e1 is an idempotent
decomposition into primitive idempotents (the corresponding simples are marked as
triangles).
     The set of weights for H D (2, 3) are marked with squares (the weights correspond-
ing to the multipartitions ((2), , ) and (, , (2)) have been explicitly labelled, to fix the
coordinate system). Note that e+i    2 is divergent in case i = 2, 3. The easiest way to
see what is happening at n = 2 is to recall the d = 3 version of the proposition in
§ 4:
Proposition. Fixing k, there are three ways to quotient to pass from H D (n, 3) to
H D (n, 2) (n > 0).
     The corresponding subsets of the set of weights for H D (2, 3) lie in three straight
lines — the dashed lines shown in figure 3(a). Since we have shown that the d = 2
algebra is isomorphic to a blob algebra in each of these cases we can give a complete
description. The lines marked 12 and 23 correspond to singly critical blob algebras,
with reflection points the intersection points of these lines with the thick lines shown.
Accordingly there are injective standard module morphisms (‘reflection’ morphisms)
as indicated by arrows. The other blob line is a semisimple quotient (from the
parameters it is nominally a singly critical case, but the reflection point lies at the
outside edge of localisation of weight space to n = 2, so there is no image of any
n = 2 weight in it). It is straightforward to show that there are no other non–trivial
morphisms. Since the d = 3 alcove structure is determined by the three d = 2
quotients, and since the morphisms indicated are all also blob module morphisms,
their location is necessarily consistent with the d = 3 Soergel procedure.
     For H D (3, 3) the three blob quotients correspond to the three dashed lines shown
in figure 3(b). The reflection morphisms shown within these lines are again simply
blob morphisms (NB, the reflection point on the third line now lies within the
localisation of weight space). The only question, then, concerns the morphisms into
the module with A2 –weight 0. This weight is marked in the figure by the rank of the
                                                                                       25


module, Rank(∆(0)|n=3 ) = 6 (this weight coincides with the weight for the unique
simple of H D (0, 3) in our scheme, since that module is a localisation of ∆(0)|n=3 ). A
straightforward Frobenius reciprocity argument (using the morphisms at level n = 2
and the generic restriction rules) shows that there are at least two homomorphisms
into this module; but does not uniquely determine the domain in either case. To
confirm the indicated morphisms, consider the walk basis of ∆(0)|n=3 and the walk
orbits of these walks — see figure 4. Note from the last of these pictures that
321 ∼G(k) 333. It follows that there is a homomorphism between the corresponding
standard modules by ((3.12) proposition) (note that walk 321 is not sorted, but that
the weaker condition of all steps in a given direction being taken consecutively is
sufficient for this construction). The other claimed morphisms follow similarly.
     It is worth noting that ∆(0)|n=3 may generically be defined as ∆(0)|n=3 =
H (3, 3)e(13 ) , where e(13 ) = e−
   D
                                 3 is the usual q–antisymmetriser [55] (i.e., ∆(0)|n=3
is the globalisation of the unique simple of H D (0, 3)). This is an illuminating con-
struct to consider in any case. The module H(3, 3)e(13 ) is, of course, much larger.
By proposition 2.6 it has basis {X a e(13 ) | a ∈ {0, 1, 2}3}. To determine a basis in our
case one must use the vanishing of e−i 2 (which generates a significant part of He(13 ) ).
This problem is dealt with elsewhere [16].

5.3    Conjectured basis for H D (n, d)
Consider w ∈ Sn , a permutation, and let S(w) be a corresponding reduced word in
the Coxeter generators {σi }. The set map from S(Sn ) to Bn given by σi → gi is
an isomorphism [33]. Thus from w ∈ Bn we may read off a permutation (which we
will also call w). Given such a permutation define symmetric relation (w) ⊂ n × n
by i(w)j if i > j implies w(i) < w(j) (and symmetry). That is, i(w)j if the lines i
and j cross in the diagram of w.
(5.2) Claim:
                      {X (a1 ,a2 ,···) w ∈ Cn | i(w)j implies ai 6= aj }
is a basis for H D (n, d).
    Idea of proof: Note that the dimensions are right (consider the Robinson–
Schensted correspondence in the form in [63], or, for example, [62]). Thus it is
enough to show spanning or linear independence. For the latter it is convenient to
have a representation R of H D (if linear independent in R then claim proven and
R faithful).
    The remainder of the paper is concerned with representations of H D .


6     On representations of bn and H D (n, d)
The ordinary Temperley–Lieb algebra has a powerful diagram calculus (see [49] for a
review). One motivation for the introduction of the blob algebra [52] was to bring the
utility of such a calculus to the representation theory of the periodic/affine algebras
studied in [51] (see also [49, Ch.8], [57, 37, 27, 29] and references therein). In fact
all the finite irreducible representations of these infinite dimensional algebras may
be constructed using [52] (although completeness is not shown there, see [26, 54]).
From the point of view of lattice Statistical Mechanics, bn also renders the ‘seam’
boundary conditions (as in [5], and cf. [46] for example) of the ice–type model [4]

into the algebraic formalism of Temperley and Lieb [64]. Indeed there are a number
of mathematical and physical reasons (in addition to the pursuit of our ingredient
I2 for H D (−, d)) why a faithful ‘tensor space’ representation of the blob would be
useful (cf. [52, §4], [57, 6, 21]).
    By a tensor space representation of bn (or H D (n, d)) we mean a representation for
each n with underlying module of form V (n) = Vaux ⊗ V ⊗n as a vector space, with
Vaux and V finite dimensional vector spaces (cf. [39]); on which the generators act
‘locally’ (in particular bn−1 ⊂ bn acts trivially on the last factor V , so the restriction
of V (n) is a manifest direct sum of dim V copies of V (n − 1)); and which is well
defined in arbitrary specialisations.
    Let e ∈ H D (n + d, d) be idempotent. A module V (n + d) for a tensor space
representation over K is globalisable by e if e projects the last d tensor factors
V ⊗d → K, and acts trivially on other tensor space factors.
    To establish ingredient I2 generically for H D (−, d) (i.e., that there exists idem-
potent ed ∈ H D (n + d, d) such that

                             ed H D (n + d, d)ed ∼
                                                 = H D (n, d)                         (39)

cf. [12, 20]) certain generalised braid diagrams may be used [55]. However,
(6.1) Proposition. Suppose V (n + d) is the module for a faithful tensor space
representation of H D (n + d, d) over C, and is globalisable by ed . Then equation (39)
holds.
To see this note that under these assumptions the actions of ed and H D (n, d) on
V (n + d) commute, and hence they commute in H D (n + d, d). Thus H D (n, d)ed ⊆
ed H D (n + d, d)ed ⊆ H D (n + d, d) is a sequence of inclusions of algebras, and
H D (n, d)ed is isomorphic to H D (n, d). Thus the action of ed H D (n + d, d)ed on
V (n + d) would be isomorphic to the H D (n, d) action on V (n). Since the latter has
a trivial kernel, this would establish equation (39) in general.
    Any faithful tensor space representation in which X acts non–trivially only in
the first normal tensor factor V (and an otherwise redundant factor V aux ) would be
a likely candidate, because of the way ingredient I2 works in the An case [36]. Let
us briefly review this.

and so on. Each such obeys a quadratic local relation with coefficients in R =
Z[q, q −1 ] (specifically MN ((g1 − q)(g1 − q −1 )) = 0).
   Putting Ui = gi − q we have

                                  M2q (Ui Ui±1 Ui − Ui ) = 0                            (40)

so M2q factors through Tn (q) (in fact it is faithful on Tn (q), i.e. Tn (q) = Hn2 (q)).
   Recall from §1.2 that e− N denotes the HN q–symmetriser (normalisable as an
idempotent provided that [N]! is invertible in K [49]). For n ≥ N, VNn is the tensor
space module for HnN (q). It is easy to check that VNn is globalisable by e−   N.

(6.3) Recall that the Tn action on V2n breaks up directly, over any field, into sum-
mands Pλ of fixed ‘charge’ or weight λ ∈ N0 , and then

                                       Pλ = +µ≥λ ∆µ                                     (41)

(generically a direct sum).
    It is desirable not only to have representations of bn that act on tensor space,
but also that they preserve some version of this charge conservation — i.e. they
are a direct sum of analogues of permutation representations. (Note for example
that the tensor space representation in [52, §4] is neither full tilting [21] nor charge
conserving.)
    One way to proceed is to search for maps from bn to Tn′ (some n′ ) (resp. H D (n, d)
to Hnd′ ), and hence obtain bn –modules by restriction of M2q . Another possibility is
to enrich suitable Tn′ –modules with the property of bn –module by determining an
action of the blob operator on them. We begin by investigating the latter.

6.1     Generalised bialgebra construction
Let (M, ◦, e) be a finite monoid, and A a K–algebra with basis M and multiplication
defined on this basis by m1 m2 = km1 ,m2 (q)m1 ◦m2 where q is some set of parameters
and k12 (q) ∈ K. (The possibilities for the coefficients will in general by constrained
by M,

    m1 (m2 m3 ) = m1 km2 ,m3 (q)(m2 ◦ m3 ) = km2 ,m3 (q)km1 ,m2 ◦m3 (q)m1 ◦ (m2 ◦ m3 )

          = km1 ,m2 (q)(m1 ◦ m2 )m3 = km1 ,m2 (q)km1 ◦m2 ,m3 (q)(m1 ◦ m2 ) ◦ m3
so km2 ,m3 (q)km1 ,m2 ◦m3 (q) = km1 ,m2 (q)km1 ◦m2 ,m3 (q), but there are plentiful solutions
— for example, any finite group algebra.) Suppose there is a triple of points in
parameter space for which

                            km1 ,m2 (q′ )km1 ,m2 (q′′ ) = km1 ,m2 (q)                   (42)

(cf. [38, §1.1.3(iv)], for example). In particular the coproduct is an algebra mor-
phism and if a submanifold S of parameter space can be found for which each pair
q′ , q′′ ∈ S has a q ∈ S satisfying equation(42) then the sum over all q ∈ S of
categories of (left) modules is closed under tensor product. (The example of group
algebras is the usual bialgebra and tensor product.)
     It is easy to show, using the diagram calculus (or via a mild generalisation of the
T–L diagram variant of cabling [47, §A(iii)]), that Tn (q) is an algebra of this type,
with q = {q}. The diagram in figure 5 illustrates the coproduct on U1 U2 ∈ T4 (q),
using lines of different thickness for different q. The cabling–like visualisation of
the two factors, in which they are embedded in a single pseudodiagram, is possible
because the thin and thick lines are arranged into subdiagrams which never meet in
any composition. It will be evident that the set of conditions (42) include −[2]q =
[2]q′ [2]q′′ in this case (consider a composition in which a closed loop arises, such
as U1 U1 ); and that this is the only non–trivial condition. Through the cabling
picture we may pass to another visualisation, in which the thinner lines have been
reflected in a vertical line at the left edge of the diagram (cf. [65]), as illustrated in
figure 6. There is no significant difference between these two visualisations, except
that it is perhaps slightly easier to describe the construction of certain tensor product
representations explicitly using the reflected form, as we will see. Again in the
reflected form we may view the picture as a single pseudodiagram (but again there
is no sense in which the right and left hand sides ever touch).

factor except the ith and (i + 1)th , where it acts as −U r , so let M2r,x (Ui ) denote a
matrix differing from this only in acting like −U r (x) in that position.

   Another way to see this is to note that, in tensor space, equation (43) allows us
to make sense of an extension of the pseudodiagrams in figure 6 in which the left
and right hand sides meet as in figure 7 (specifically, this figure may be replaced
by a scalar multiple of one in which the loop composed of mixed line segments is
omitted).

Figure 8: The Pascal triangle of bn standard modules (layers n = 0, 1, ..., 7 are
shown) complicated at m ∈ Z by reflection homomorphisms. Here we show, by their
dimensions, the composition factors of each standard in cases m = −1, −2, −3.

This mild complication has the merit that the blob/box symmetry of the algebra
[52] maps this representation to one of the same type.
    The isomorphism of bn to its opposite (note the symmetry of the relations under
writing back to front) provides an automorphism which is fixed by ρ0 (the represen-
tations of the generators are symmetric matrices), thus ρ0 is contravariant self–dual.
The same is true of ρs .
    These very exciting representations merit further study. Cox, Martin and Ryom–
Hansen have recently shown [16] that they are generically faithful. Other intriguing
questions are: Are they (full) tilting? How do they generalize to higher d? The
latter question is not trivial. We have made considerable use of the T–L diagram
calculus here, and there is no such powerful tool in evidence for higher d, short of
the braid group itself. The remainder of the paper is essentially concerned with
addressing this question.

6.2                 Other constructions
The blob algebra bn (q, m) is (at least) singly critical when m ∈ Z+ , cf. section 1.1
— if q is not a root of unity then the procedure there still works, but with l set
unboundedly large. This means that the usual Pascal triangle of standard modules
[52] is complicated by at least one wall of ‘reflection’ homomorphisms from outside
to inside across the alcove wall at m, as exemplified in figure 8. There is a suggestive
combinatorial coincidence with Tn manifest in the dimension of heads of the blob
standard modules in certain singly critical (i.e. m ∈ Z) cases. This starts with the
m = ±1 cases, where there is a bn quotient given by e− 7→ 0 (resp. 1). It follows
immediately from the relations that this quotient is isomorphic to Tn (and so the
coincidence is explained). Figure 8 exhibits a similar phenomenon at m = −2.
These may be regarded as special cases of a more general ‘braid construction’.
    In the next sections we describe this braid construction, and review aspects of
the connection between the blob algebra and periodic (and affine) systems which
lead to other useful maps from bn (and other H(n, d) quotients) into ordinary Hecke
quotients, and hence into tensor space.

7     Braids and the blob approach to periodic sys-
      tems
In this paper the ‘A-type braid group’ A–braid is the group of braidings of a row
of initially vertical strings numbered from the top left: 1, 2, ..., which braidings are
trivial on all but finitely many strings. The subgroup An –braid acts trivially on
all but the first n strings (so A0 –braid = A1 –braid ⊂ A2 –braid ⊂ ...). Thus Hn is
a quotient of CAn –braid, and gi is the braid in which string i crosses over string
i + 1. Evidently such elements, and inverses, generate the group [45, 8].            Let
(−) : An –braid → An –braid be the automorphism given by gi 7→ gn−i [49, §5.7.2] (cf.
[65]).
    Occasionally we shall need to refer to the group of braidings of precisely n strings
(as for example in the Young subgroup construction — see [49, §13.1 p323]). This
group is obviously isomorphic to An –braid, and we will distinguish them only by
context. Let 1m denote the identity element on precisely m strings, and
                             1m
                              C : An –braid → Amn –braid

the corresponding cabling morphism (replace each string with m parallel strings).
    Let ∆ : An –braid → An –braid × An –braid be the group comultiplication. Let
Y : An –braid × An –braid ֒→ A2n –braid be the natural ‘Young’ embedding, extended
to (a version of) the full braid group by extending the numbering of strings to
Z \ {0} — i.e. essentially the full line not the half line — and placing the second
copy of An –braid on the ‘minus’ side. Let F be the map back to the full braid
group proper got by folding the left hand side of the plane over onto the right hand
side at a point slightly shifted from the origin (so that each negatively numbered
string starting point lies just to the left of its positively numbered version and the
system is bounded on the left again), then renumbering — see figure 9. Let S be
the map back to A–braid got by renumbering i 7→ i + n + 1 (i < 0) and i 7→ i + n
(i > 0) and discarding all strings numbered less than 1.         Now define a map 12F
from An –braid → A2n –braid by commutativity of:
                                                    12F
                An –braid                                                 /       A2n –braid
                                                                                       O
                         ∆                                                           F
                                 1×(−)                               Y
          An –braid × An –braid           /   An –braid × An –braid           /   A2n –braid
and similarly for 12S . The map 12F is similar also to the m = 2 cabling morphism
in that each string now has a partner running parallel to it, but the over/under
information is not the same.
(7.1) We now recall certain constructions from [49, §5.7] (some changes of notation
will be necessary). Let CÂn –braid denote the algebra associated to affine graph Ân
there (strictly speaking only every other such graph has a pregraph, but this need
not concern us); let Ân –braid denote the underlying group (i.e. the affinization of
the ordinary braid group); and let g. denote the ‘extra’ generator associated to the
affinizing vertex in Ân cf. An−1 . Define
                                   G = g1 g2 . . . gn−1
in An –braid (the element in which string 1 crosses over strings 2 to n); and note
that GgiG−1 = gi+1 (i < n − 1).
                                                                                       35




       Figure 9: Illustration of the folding injection of An –braid into itself.

Proposition. [49] There is a homomorphism φ0 : Ân –braid 7→ An –braid given by
identification on the An –braid subalgebra and g. 7→ Ggn−1 G−1 .
    As noted for example in [47, §3] there are actually a number of closely related
ways of building representations of the affine (or periodic) case, corresponding to
the choice of periodic boundary conditions (the ‘cohomological seam’) in a physical
system. This was systematized, in [52, §3], by the introduction of the idempotent
blob generator e− . Using this one builds an invertible generator g− = 1 + ae− (a
a suitable constant) obeying

                                 g− g1 g− g1 = g1 g− g1 g−                           (49)

(see also proposition (4.4)) and defines G− = g− G. Then

                                  g. 7→ G− gn−1(G− )−1                               (50)

defines a generalisation φa of φ0 for each suitable choice of a, ye (see [52, eq.(25)]).
    Note that neither equation(4) nor the blob construction for g− are needed to
verify the map in eqn.(50); only equation(49) is necessary. Thus the map generalises
to H(n), and even to the level of braids:
(7.2) The connection between the B–type and periodic systems now follows, in as
much as Bn –braid may be realized as the group of braids on the cylinder, whereupon
π = gn−1 gn−2 . . . g1 g0 is the braid got from the identity braid by turning the bottom
edge of the cylinder through one vertex clockwise (i.e. so as to take vertex 1 into
vertex 2, and so on); and π ′ , the corresponding generalisation of G− (i.e. with g−
replaced by g0 ), is the anticlockwise turn. Thus Bn –braid may be thought of as
having affine Ân –braid as a subgroup — with g. = πg1 π −1 = π ′ gn−1 (π ′ )−1 , cf. [52,
§3].

7.1    Homomorphisms of Bn–braid to An′ –braid
(7.3) Let A = An –braid and n = {1, 2, ..., n}. For b ∈ A and i ∈ n define b(i) to be
the final position of string i in b.
    Let p be any partition of (equivalently, equivalence relation on) n. Then for each
such p there is a subset of A = An –braid such that b ∈ A implies b(i) ∼ i. This
subset is a subgroup — call it p − An –braid, or just p–braid. E.g. if p is the ‘trivial’
relation ({n}) then p–braid = A; if p is the identity relation then p-braid is the pure
braid group (the normal subgroup whose quotient is the permutation action on n,
b(i), described above).
                                                                                        36

Figure 10: Li — here the shaded area represents the identity braid on the first i − 1
strings.

   For convenience when dealing with general n we will describe a partition for
which each i > m, some m, is in the same part by only giving the other parts. Thus
{}-braid = {n}-braid = A; and {{1}}-braid=: A′ is the group which is pure on string
1.
(7.4) Let Li ∈ An –braid be the pure braid which takes string i behind all earlier
strings then back in front of them (i.e. L1 = 1 and Li+1 =gi Li gi ). See figure 10.
  Note that in the Hecke algebraQquotient Li is the image of Xi ∈ H(n, 1)|λ1 =1 ;
that Li Lj = Lj Li and that Cn = ni=1 Li is the (‘clockwise’ or gi –built) pure twist
element of An –braid, denoted M 2 in [49, §5.7.2].
(7.5) Proposition. Let b be any element of Am−1 –braid. Then there is an injective
group homomorphism

                     fbm : Bn –braid −→ {m − 1}−An+m−1 –braid

                                        g0 7→ Cm b
                                      gi 7→ gi+m−1 .

Proof: consider figure 11. This checks the key relation explicitly.
   For example, f12 is g0 7→ g1 g1 , g1 7→ g2 and so on. f11 is g0 7→ 1, gi 7→ gi (i > 0).
(7.6) There is a group homomorphism extending the 12C cabling morphism (cf. [49,
Ch.13]; note also [17]):

                             12C : Bn –braid −→ A2n –braid

                                         g0 7→ g1
                                      gi 7→ 12C (gi ).
There is a similar homomorphism extending the 12S morphism:

                             12S : Bn –braid −→ A2n –braid

                                         g0 7→ gn
                                      gi 7→ gn−i gn+i
(cf. figure 9); and another extending 12F .

8     On tensor space representations of H(n, d)
The constructions above allow us to build representations of Bn –braid from type–
A representations (and if these are charge conserving tensor space representations
then these properties will be preserved, in some sense, as will globalisability). Our
strategy now in searching for maps from bn to Tn (and generalisations to d > 2) may
be summarized by the following picture.

                                                    bn

                                             φ

                                                             ?
                                        H(n, d)

                           Ψd


                                                                            ′
                    H(n)                      Hn′                 End(V ⊗n )
                                    X                R

The Northeast pointing maps are the canonical quotients from sections 1 and 4 (we
will call the combined map η); the map R is the ordinary representation on tensor
space; and the dotted line is the desired map occurring if R ◦ X factors through bn .
The exercise is to find among the maps X those for which R ◦ X so factors. (As
                                                                                          38


we will see, the candidates we noted in §6.2 for maps from bn to Tn are just special
cases of the simple representations fbm of Bn –braid above.)
   By (6.2) each B–braid quotient of form
                                     fm                 M
                                    b
                         Bn –braid −→              N
                                      Am+n –braid −→ VNm+n                              (51)

(‘auxiliary space’ construction) or
                                          12            M
                                                    N
                           Bn –braid −→ A2n –braid −→ VN2n

(‘cabling related’ construction) factors through a partial specialisation of H(n, d)
(some d) in which the g0 (i.e. X) eigenvalues are determined in terms of q, but q is
indeterminate. Obviously the M2 ◦f12 quotient obeys a quadratic f (g0 ) = 0, so d = 2,
so it factors through some specialisation of HeckeB (n); but f (g0 ) has coefficients in
Z[q, q −1 ], so still this is not generic (HeckeB has two parameters, q and Q, say).
    Since all our maps M2 ◦ X map into the Tn action on V2n (for some n), their
image breaks up at least as far as in eqn.(41).
    Possible next steps here are: (i) to investigate the generic irreducible content
of the fb representations (of whatever specialisation of H(n, d) they might provide);
and (ii) to investigate what portion of parameter space is actually accessible by this
construction (i.e. what eigenvalues of g0 we can realise by varying b). Fixing q, this
portion is discrete, i.e. of measure zero, but then so is the (at least singly critical)
portion we are most interested in, so it is not necessarily too restricted.
    NB, if we want to access a dense subset of parameter space this cannot be via
MN ◦ fbm , since this depends continuously only on q. Instead we could look at maps
ending on, say, ⊗di=1 VNn |q=qi .

8.1     On cabling related maps
Underlying the map 12F is the full range of direct product representations of An –braid.
In particular we can regard ⊗i MNqi as a representation of An –braid. In general
we may not assume that these representations will factor through any particular
Hecke quotient, but if one does then it could provide a generalisation of the ex-
tension of 12F to Bn –braid. We form R⊗ (gi) = MNq (gn−i ) ⊗ MNr (gn+i ) and try, say,
R⊗ (g0 ) = 1 ⊗ MNs (gn−i) ⊗ 1 and compute R⊗ (g0 g1 g0 g1 − g1 g0 g1 g0 ). In this particular
case, with N = 3, the image vanishes only when q = r = s (a brute force calcula-
tion). An analogous deformation of the extended 12C map at N = 3 fails in the same
way.
    The 12C cabling map with N = 2 does not factor through bn in general either.
Further investigations are hindered by the magnitude of the computations required,
but these negative results serve well to illustrate the extraordinary nature of the
ρ–representations in proposition(6.4).

8.2     On N = 2 auxiliary spaces, bn , and ‘The coincidence’
In (51) we require that MN ◦ fbm (x) is also a representation (R say) of η(x) for all
x. Firstly,
                                  η : gi 7→ q + Ui
                                                                                           39


so equation(40) verifies equation(30). We also require R(U1 e− U1 − k− U1 ) = 0 for
some k− (the relation (3) is not sufficient to ensure this). Whenever we find a map,
the other question is: Is it faithful?
(8.1) Since
                                    η : g0 7→ α1 + βe−
the spectrum of M2 (fbm (g0 )) must be quadratic if the map is to factor through the
blob as it stands. By (6.3) this spectrum may be determined from the action on the
zero charge sector P0 of V2n . The following lists are the eigenvalues with multiplicities
in this sector, arranged by standard Tn –module factor with the ‘spine’ module on
the left and so on.
M2 (L1 ): {1}
M2 (L2 = C2 ): {q 2 , q −2 }
M2 (L3 ): {q 2 , q −2 , q −4 } M2 (C3 ): {1, 1, q −6}
M2 (L4 ): {1, 1, q 2, q −4 , q −4 , q −6 } M2 (C4 ): {1, 1, q −4, q −4, q −4 , q −12 }
M2 (C5 ): {q −4 , q −4, q −4 , q −4 , q −4 , q −10 , q −10 , q −10 , q −10 , q −20 }
M2 (C6 ): {q −8 , .., q −8, q −12 , .., q −12 , q −20 , .., q −20 , q −32 }
The pattern for Ci will be obvious.
    Note, therefore, that C1 , C2, C3 are the only possibilities here (unless we further
specialize to q a root of unity). ‘Null’ twist C1 corresponds to the m = ±1 case
already discussed. For the other cases it remains to check that the candidates for
images of the generators obey U1 e− U1 = k− U1 for some scalar k− .
(8.2) Example: M2 ◦ f12 . (Let u1, u0 denote the canonical preimages along η of U1
and e− .) An elementary calculation finds a value of k− for which

                               M2 (f12 (u1 u0 u1 − k− u1 )) = 0

This value then determines that the blob parameter m = −2 here.
    Since span(1,g1 )=span(1,g1 g1 ) here (and V2n is a faithful Tn –module) the image
of Bn –braid here is the whole of Tn+1 . Thus (6.3) determines the structure of V2n+1
as a Bn –braid–module. For n = 2 it is

                             V23 = 1 + (2 + 1) + (2 + 1) + 1,                            (52)

(representing summands by their dimensions) which is the structure as a T3 –module.
Since we hit the whole of T3 equation(52) is the irreducible decomposition with q
generic. Let us call the two inequivalent modules here M 1 , M 2 . The generic simples
of H(2, 2), as indexed by their 2–partitions (see §1), are

                2–partition ((2), ) ((1), (1)) (, (2)) ((12 ), ) (, (12 ))

all but the last two of which survive the quotient to b2 . Note, therefore, that if the
T3 standard M 2 breaks up no further (i.e. q–generically) it IS a blob representation
for m = −2, but that M2 ◦ f12 cannot be a faithful bn –module.
    For B3 –braid we have V24 = 1 + (3 + 1) + (2 + 3 + 1) + (3 + 1) + 1 (as a T4 –module)

 (blob representations indicated with a *). Recall that at m = −2 blob standards
break up as shown in figure 8. In particular at n = 3

                                                   1  231
                                                          .
                                                   −→ 1

Note that here, and for all n, the heads of the bn standards to the right of the
m = −2 line may indeed be identified with the (generic) irreducible Tn+1 –modules.
This is neat, but it follows that none of these representations are faithful.
    To summarize the last 2 sections, we have not been successful in generalising
the ρ–representations. The search for full tilting modules for general d continues,
and we report these negative results partly to avoid unnecessary duplication later.
More positively, the representations we have found are interesting from the point of
view of Yang–Baxter equations in Physics [4], but we will discuss these applications
elsewhere.

                                                Appendix
A        On the Bernstein centre Z(H(n)) and Z(H(n, d))
Some of the manipulations of ideals in §4 and thereafter are not trivial. The following
mechanical exposition of the Bernstein centre and its image in Z(H(n, d)) may help
the reader to see where they come from.
(A.1) Following on from equation(17) define ĝi = [Xi , gi] (thus ĝi = (Xi − Xi+1 )gi +
(q − q −1 )Xi+1 ). Then
                                ĝi Xj = Xσi (j) ĝi                                (53)
ĝi ĝi+1 ĝi = Xi gi (Xi+1 gi+1 −gi+1 Xi+1 )Xi gi +· · · = Xi gi Xi (Xi+1 gi+1 )gi −Xi gi (gi+1 gi Xi gi )Xi gi +· · ·
                   = · · · = Xi+1 gi+1 Xi gi−1 Xi+1 gi+1 − gi+1 Xi+1 Xi gi−1 gi+1 Xi+1 + · · ·
        = Xi+1 gi+1 Xi (gi − (q − q −1 ))Xi+1 gi+1 − gi+1 Xi+1 Xi (gi − (q − q −1 ))gi+1 Xi+1 + · · ·


         = Xi+1 gi+1 Xi gi Xi+1 gi+1 − gi+1 Xi+1 Xi gi gi+1 Xi+1 + · · · = ĝi+1 ĝi ĝi+1 .                     (54)
Let K be our ground ring (an integral domain), K[X− ] the ring of polynomials in
the Xi s, and K(X− ) the field of fractions. Note that we can write

                                                 αi ĝi = gi + βi
                                                                                     41


where both αi and βi lie in K(X− ). (NB, in our quotient Ψd , the image of K[X− ]
itself generically, but not always, contains αi and βi . For example, when d = 1 and
q 2 = 1 then Xi − Xi+1 is not invertible.) It then follows from equation(53) that any
element of the extension of H(n) by K(X− ) can be expressed in the form
                                          X
                                     h=        cw ĝw
                                         w∈Bn


where cw ∈ K(X− ) and ĝw is obtained by putting hats on the generators in w.
Indeed the extension may be decomposed as
                                 M
                                    K(X− )ĝw                            (55)
                                      w∈Bn


(an induction on the usual length function on Bn ). Suppose h has at least one w 6= 1
with cw 6= 0 (i.e. h 6∈ K(X− ) subalgebra). Then there is at least one i such that
w(i) 6= i (under the obvious generalisation of the σi action in equation(53)) and
                                X               X
                         hXi =      cw ĝw Xi =   cw Xw(i) ĝw
                                  w              w

so the ĝw component of hXi − Xi h is cw (Xw(i) − Xi ) 6= 0. Thus ZK[X− ] (H(n)) =
K[X− ] ⊇ Z(H(n)). But with c ∈ K[X− ], then ĝw c − cĝw = (cw − c)ĝw so Z(H(n)) =
X Σ as Bernstein says.
(A.2) Naturally Z(H(n, d)) ⊇ Ψd (X Σ ), depending in principle on the ground ring.
The argument above mostly works in this case (to show equality), although the possi-
ble specialisations of the ground ring become more restricted (λi 6= 0, plus the restric-
tions already mentioned, for example). Note also that Ψd (K[X− ]) is finite dimen-
sional. This makes it interesting to study Ψd (X Σ ) — an algebra which is, in a sense,
more complicated that X Σ itself. For example, H(2, 1) ∼         = Hn and dim(Z(H2 ) =
H2 ) = 2, so dim(Ψ1 (X )) = 2. Here a basis for Ψ1 (X ) is {1, X + X2 = λ1 (1 + g12 )}
                         Σ                                Σ

(note that this example illustrates the problem with q 2 = 1).
    For another example, recall that dim(Z(H(2, 2))) = 5 generically, so dim(Ψ1 (X Σ )) =
5. Here a basis for Ψ2 (X Σ ) is {1, X + X2 , XX2 , X 2 + X22 , (X + X2 )XX2 } (this is not
supposed to be obvious!). Another basis, convenient for comparison with the basis
of H(2, 2), is

            {1, X + X2 , XX2 , (X + X2 − (λ1 + λ2 ))g1 , (XX2 − λ1 λ2 )g1 }.       (56)

(A.3) The set of monomial symmetric polynomials in two variables X1 , X2 (a basis
for Z(H(2))) may be indexed by the set Λ2 of Young diagrams of not more than two
rows (write ma = (X a )Σ , then m(0) = 1 and m(1) = X1 + X2 , and so on). NB, The
set of such polynomials in which the degree of no individual variable exceeds d − 1
is not a basis for Ψd (X Σ ) in general, as we see from the examples above.
