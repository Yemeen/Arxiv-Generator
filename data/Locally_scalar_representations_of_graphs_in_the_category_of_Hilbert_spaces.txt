                                            Preface
                                            In article [1] authors wrote: “Recently it became evident that a number of problems of linear
                                            algebra allows common formulating and in this formulating common effective methods of inves-
                                            tigations of such problems appear. It is interesting that these methods appear to be connected
                                            with such concepts as Coxeter–Weyl group and Dynkin schemes.”
                                               One of these problems was a problem of representations of quivers [2] (see also [3–5]). Ac-
                                            cording to the Gabriel theorem a connected quiver has finite representative type if and only if
                                            corresponding nonoriented graph is a Dynkin scheme. Coxeter functors defined in [1] served to
                                            explain this fact (which was obtained by P. Gabriel a posteriori).
                                               Furher the theory of representations of quivers (in the category of finite-dimensional vector
                                            spaces) was widely developed [6–10].
                                               One may consider representations of quivers also in metric and, in particular, Hilbert spaces
                                            ([11–13]). But if we use suggesting themselves natural definitions, the problem of classification
                                            of representations of qiuvers (excluding a quiver each connected component of which consists
                                            of one vertex or of two vertices and and arrow between them) in such categories will become
                                            “wild” (in terms of [14], i. e. including a problem of unitary classification of arbitrary linear
                                            operator or a pair of self-adjoint operators).
                                               In the following we suggest a limitation of local scalarity to the representations of a graph
                                            (or a quiver) in the category of Hilbert spaces, and after that a theory close to [1–10] arise,
                                            though specific for Hilbert spaces aspects arise.
                                               Note that in some particular case a problem of classification of locally-scalar representations
                                            in other terms studied in [16–17] (see example 3).
                                               In §§ 2, 3 for the category of locally-scalar representations of graph in the category of
                                            Hilbert spaces functors of even and odd Coxeter reflections are defined. In § 4 with their help
                                            an analogue of Gabriel theorem is proved.


                                            1        Basic definitions
                                            Let H will be the category of Hilbert spaces, which objects are separable Hilbert spaces (finite-
                                            dimensional or infinite-dimensional) and morphisms are bounded operators. To each ϕ ∈

                                                                                                 1
H(A, B) uniquely corresponds ϕ∗ ∈ H(B, A).
   According to Gabriel [2], we will call oriented graphs as quivers, leaving the term “graph”
for nonoriented graphs. In both cases we will admit loops, multiple arrows and edges.
   Thus, a quiver Q consists of two sets Qv (vertices) and Qa (arrows) and two maps t and h
from Qa to Qv , associated each arrow α ∈ Qa with its tail t(α) and head h(α).
   Graph G consists of sets Gv (vertices) and Ge (edges) and a map ε from Ge to set of one- and
two-element subsets Gv . To each quiver Q in a natural way its graph G = G(Q) corresponds.
   Representation π of a quiver Q in an arbitrary category K associates to each vertex a ∈ Qv
an object π(a) ∈ K and to each arrow α ∈ Qa a morphism π(α) ∈ K(A, B), where A = π(t(α)),
B = π(h(α)).
   In [1–10] K = mod k, where k is a field. Representations of a quiver Q over field k form a
category Rep (Q, k).
   If π is a representation of Q in H then to each arrow α : a → b, besides operator π(α) :
A → B, an operator π ∗ (α) : B → A corresponds. Thus, in the category H it is naturally to
define a representation π of a graph G = G(Q) which associates to each arrow a ∈ Gv an object
π(a) = Ha ∈ H, to each edge γ ∈ Ge with {i, j} = ε(γ) when i 6= j a pair of interadjoint linear
operators π(γ) = {Γij , Γji} where Γij : Hj → Hi , and when ε(γ) = {i} a pair of interadjoint
operators π(γ) = {Γii , Γ∗ii }.
   Consequently, we can identify representations of a quiver Q and of a graph G = G(Q) in
the category H. We will prefer in this paper to consider in Hilbert spaces representations of
graphs, but all results can be naturally restated for quivers.
   Representation π of a graph G is said to be finite-dimensional, if dim π(i) < ∞ for all i ∈ Gv .
   It is known that graph G0 , consisting of one loop, has infinite-dimensional indecomposable
representations (in Rep (G0 , H)).
   We will call representation π of a graph G discrete, if it decompose to direct sum (finite or
infinite) of finite-dimensional representations.
   Let us construct a category Rep (G, H) of representations G in H.
   Morphism C : π → π̃ is a family {Ci }i∈Gv of operators Ci : π(i) → π̃(i) such that diagrams

                                                  Γji

                                            
                                         Ci y
                                                         C
                                                         y j
                                                  Γ̃ji
                                           H̃i −−−→ H̃j
are commutative, i. e.

                                           Cj Γji = Γ̃ji Ci .                                  (1)

   It can be shown that operators Ci realizing an equivalence of two representations can be
chosen as unitary (see, for instance, [15]), i. e. equivalent objects of the category Rep (G, H)
are unitary equivalent.
   Support Gπv = Gπ of a representation π is a set {i ∈ Gv | π(i) 6= 0}.
   Denote Mi a set of vertices
                         S      connected with vertex i by edge; M i = {γ ∈ Ge | i ∈ ε(γ)}; if
X ⊂ Gv then M(X) = (        Mi ) \ X.

  Representation π faithful if Gπ = Gv .

                                                   2
  Let π ∈ Rep (G, H). Let A(γ, i) = Γ∗jiΓji when ε(γ) = {i, j}, and A(γ, i) = Γ∗ii Γii + Γii Γ∗ii
when ε(γ) = {i}, and
                                           X
                                   Ai =       A(γ, i).
                                              γ∈M i

   Ai is a selfadjoint operator in space Hi = π(i). If M i = ∅ we will consider Ai = 0. Note that
if G does not consist loops and multiple edges than
                                              X
                                         Ai =      Γij Γji.
                                               j∈Mi

    A representation π will be named as locally-scalar if all operators Ai are scalar, Ai = αi IHi ,
where IHi is identical operator in space Hi ; since Ai are positive operators, αi ≥ 0.
    If π(j) = 0 for all j ∈ Mi and π(i) 6= 0, then, obviously, αi = 0. We denote Rep (G) full
subcategory in Rep (G, H), which objects are locally-scalar.
    Denote by VG a linear real space, which consists of the collections x = (xi ) of real numbers
xi (i ∈ Gv ); elements x from Gv we will call G-vectors. Vector x = (xi ) we will call positive
(x > 0) if x 6= 0 and xi ≥ 0 for i ∈ Gv . Let us denote VG+ = {x ∈ VG | x > 0}. Any
                                  T + can be identified with corresponding G-vector (f (i))i∈Gv .
function f on Gv with the real values
                          +
ZG = {d : Gv → N0 }, ZG = ZG VG .
    G-vector d(i) = dim π(i) is dimension of a finite-dimensional representation π ∈ Rep (G, H);
if Ai = f (i)IHi for i ∈ Gv , then f (i) we will call as character of locally-scalar representation
π, and π will be f -representation. Character is determined uniquely on the support Gπ of
the representation π (and ambiguously determined outside of the support). If Gv = Gπ then
character of the representation is determined uniquely and is denoted by fπ . In a common case
let us denote by {fπ } the set of characters of the representation π.
    For graphs there may exist both infinite-dimensional and finite-dimensional indecomposable
representations and the dimensions of the latter may not be bounded. At the same time, even
in the elementary cases, there exist infinitely many indecomposable representations in the fixed
dimension corresponding to different characters.
    We will say that G is (locally-scalar) finitely representable in H, if all its locally-scalar
representation are discrete, dimensions of its indecomposable locally-scalar representations are
bounded in the whole and in each dimension the number of indecomposable representations
with given character is finite.
    In what follows we will prove that connected finite graph is finitely representable if and only
if it is Dynkin scheme (An , Dn , E6 , E7 , E8 ), and in this case its indecomposable representations
are uniquely determined by dimension and a value of character defined on the support of the
representation.
    Example 1. An arbitrary graph G has a locally-scalar representation π in the dimension
d(i) ≡ 1. Let π(i) = Cei , (ei , ei ) = 1 and π(γij ) = {Γji, Γij }, where Γjiei = ej and Γij ej = ei
(ε(γij ) = {i, j}). Then character f (i) = |M i |. π indecomposable if and only if G is connected.
    Example 2. G0 consists of one vertex a and one loop γ. Let π be a locally-scalar rep-
resentation of a graph G0 , for which π(γ) = {Γ, Γ∗ }, f (a) = α, i. e. ΓΓ∗ + Γ∗ Γ = αIH . In
[14] it was shown that all indecomposable locally-scalar representations no more than two-
dimensional; given fixed positive α in the dimension 2 indecomposable representations depend
on two continuous parameters, so graph G0 is not finitely representable.

                                                 3
   Let us instance nondiscrete representation of the graph G0 which is decomposable, though
it can not be decomposed into direct sum of the indecomposable representations (but only
into their integral). Consider a Hilbert space H with (orthonormal) basis {ei }, i ∈ Z, and an
operator Γ(ei ) = ei+1 in it (Γ∗ Γ + ΓΓ∗ = 2IH ). Hence H does not contain finite-dimensional
invariant subspaces.
   Example 3. A problem of (unitary) classification of locally-scalar representations of the
graph Gn




was considered in fact (in other terms) in the works [16–19]. In [16–17] it was studied a problem
of classification up to unitary equivalence of collections of orthoprojectors P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn (in the
                                        Pn
separable Hilbert space H) such that       Pk = αIH and, in particular, a problem of description
                                          k=1
of the set Σn of that real numbers α, for which there exists at least one collection of such
orthoprojectors (in the nonzero space).
    Corresponding to the orthoprojector Pi a space Hi = ImPi and a natural enclosure (isometry)
Γi : Hi → H we will get a locally-scalar representation π of the graph Gn if we put π(i) = Hi ,
i ∈ 1, n π(0) = H, π(γi ) = {Γi , Γ∗i }. At that the character f (i) = 1 at i 6= 0 and f (0) = α
                                P
                                n
(Γ∗i Γi = IHi , Pi = Γi Γ∗i and   Γk Γ∗k = αIH ).
                               k=1
    In [18–19] for representations of the graph Gn were constructed functors which structure
and role during the description of representations is the same as one of Coxeter functors in
[1]. Using these functors, in [17] full description of the set Σn and new results concerning the
collections of orthoprojectors were obtained.
    As it was mentioned above, the graph G0 (a loop) has infinite-dimensional indecomposable
representations, but they are not locally-scalar. As it follows from [17], the graph Gn has
infinite-dimensional indecomposable locally-scalar representations if and only if n > 4.


2     Functors of reflections
Example 2 implies if G contains a cycle then G is not finitely representable in H. We will study
a question of finite representability and thus we restict ourselves to graphs not containing cycles:
everywhere below G is a finite connected graph without cycles (a wood).

Denote as B a quadratic form on the space VG defined by formula B(x) =                x2i −             xi xj ,
                                                                               i∈Gv           γij ∈Ge
and as < , > — corresponding symmetric bilinear form. Form B(x) is named the Tits form of
the graph G.
   In propositions 3.1–3.3 we collect well-known results from [1] which we will use further.

Proposition 3.1.
   1. Let i ∈ Gv , then σi (x) = x − 2 < i, x > i, σi2 = 1 .
   2. Group W , generated by reflections σi , retains the integral lattice in VG and retains the
quadratic form B.
   3. If the form B is positive defined then group W is finite.
   4. Form B is positive defined for graphs An , Dn , E6 , E7 , E8 (Dynkin graphs) and only for
them.

   For each i ∈ Gv we denote as ī a vector in VG such that (ī)j = 0 when i 6= j and (ī)i = 1.
   Vector x ∈ VG is said to be a root if for some i ∈ Gv and w ∈ W we have x = wi. Vectors i
are simple roots. Root x is positive if x > 0.

Proposition 3.2.
  1. If x — root then x — integral vector and B(x) = 1.
  2. If x — root then −x — root.
  3. If x — root then either x > 0 or (−x) > 0.

Proposition 3.3. If the form B for a graph G is positive defined then:
  1) transformation c in the space VG has no nonzero invariant vectors;
  2) if x ∈ VG , x 6= 0 then for some natural k vector ck x is not positive.

    Let us return to locally-scalar representations of a graph G in the category of Hilbert spaces.

Lemma 3.4. If G is Dynkin graph and d = (di ) — its positive not simple root then d results
from the simple root by the sequence of even and odd Coxeter transformations.

   Proof. Let m — the minimal natural number with the property: cm (d) 6∈ G+         V (such m can
be found by the proposition 3.3). Applying to d sequentially transformations of odd and even
reflections we will obtain positive root de such that the next vector will be negative. Then, as is
well-known, de will be simple root (transfer from the positive root to the negative one is made

lemma is proved.

Lemma 3.5. Let π ∈ Rep (G), i ∈ Gv , d(i) 6= 0, f (i) = 0. Then π = πi             π ′ , where Gπi = i
      ′
and Gπ 6∋ i (a case π ′ = 0 is not excluded).
                                                                                        L
    Indeed, f (i) = 0 implies Γij = 0 when γij ∈ M (i), and d(i) 6= 0 implies π = πi          π′.

Proposition 3.6. All locally-scalar representation of a Dynkin graph G in the category of
Hilbert spaces are discrete.

   Proof will be carried out by the induction on n = |Gv |. When n = 1 the statement is trivial
(separable Hilbert space is orthogonal direct sum, finite or infinite, of the one-dimensional
spaces).
   Let the statement is proved for Dynkin graphs with the number of vertices, which is ≤ n − 1.
   Let n > 1 and π ∈ Ob Rep (G). If Gπ 6= Gv then it is possible to turn from π to the
representation π               e with the less number of vertices (G
                e of the graph G                                     ev = Gπ ) and to make use
of the presumption of induction.                                                          L ′
   Let Gπ = Gv . Presume that f ∈ {fπ }, f (g) = 0, g ∈ Gv , then by the lemma 3.5 π = πg    π
and we can use the presumption of induction again.
   Let Gπ = Gv and the character f (i) > 0 when i ∈ Gv . Applying to (π, f ) by turns functors

   a) either ck (f ) is positive for all k, which contradicts to proposition 3.3;
   b) or after applying functor one of the conditions Gπe = Gv , f(i)e > 0 when i ∈ Gv will fail
(and in this case we will return to the situation considered earlier).

Proposition 3.7. Any locally-scalar indecomposable representation π of a Dynkin graph G
results from the some simplest representation Πg by the functors of even and odd reflections.

of indecomposable locally-scalar representations of a graph G defined up to unitary equivalence.
    By the simple root ḡ and function ug (i) by the sequence of Coxeter reflections in k steps we
will obtain from the simplest object (Πg , fg ) an object (π, f ) of the category Rep  g (G, `) (π is
indecomposable in Rep (G) representation from Ind G).
    So, we have defined a map

                                              ϕ : NG → Ind G.
   All indecomposable locally-scalar representations of Dynkin graph are obtained in this way
(see proposition 3.7).
   Let Ind G is a subset in the set Ind G of faithful representations, TG — subset of the simple
roots ī and Li — set of that values k, for which triples (ī, k, ui) ∈ ϕ−1 (Ind G).
   Following statement holds:

Theorem 3.9. The map ϕ : NG → Ind G is surjection, at that each faithful representation π
from Ind G has unique ϕ-inverse image; for nonfaithful π vector ī and the number k in ϕ−1 (π)
are determined uniquely, and function ui — ambiguously.

     when n = 2m: TG = {3, 4, . . . , m + 1}, L3 = {2m − 3, 2m − 2}, . . ., Lm+1 = {m − 1, m}.
   3. For graph E6




   h(i) = 11, i = 1, 6; TG = {2, 3, 4, 6}, L2 = {5}, L3 = {2, 3, 4, 5}, L4 = {5}, L6 = {4}.
   4. For graph E7




   h(i) = 17, i = 1, 7; TG = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}, L2 = {5, 6, 7}, L3 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, L4 = {3, 6, 7, 8},
L5 = {7}, L7 = {4, 8}.
   5. For graph E8




   h(i) = 29, i = 1, 8; TG = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}, L1 = {7, 12, 13}, L2 = {5 − 8, 11 − 14},

   Let π Λ is a finite-dimensional representation of a quiver Q over the field C. If spaces of the
representation are Hilbert (i. e. unitary, since they are finite-dimensional) then the represen-
tation π Λ can be naturally continued to the representation π of the graph G = G(Q) in the
category of Hilbert spaces.
   If π Λ is equivalent in Rep (Q, C) to the representation π
                                                            eΛ such that the continued represen-
tation πe of a graph G is locally-scalar, we will say that the representation π Λ of a quiver Q is
unitarizable.
Proposition 4.2. Graph G is a Dynkin graph if and only if with G = G(Q) any finite-
dimensional indecomposable representation π Λ of a quiver Q is unitarizable.
    Proof. If a graph G is a Dynkin graph then dimension d(i) of the representation π Λ is
                                                                                                     •      ◦

From the simplest representation Πg in this dimension by functors F and F a locally-scalar
representation π      e can be obtained. Representations π Λ and π         eΛ of a quiver Q are equivalent
in Rep (Q, C) since for Dynkin graphs in the dimension d(i) there exist a unique up to the
equivalence indecomposable representation ([1,2]).
    The condition of unitarizability can be restated also in such a way: for the representation
π Λ of a quiver Q it is possible to define a scalar product in the representation spaces so as the
continued representation of a graph G in the category of Hilbert spaces will be locally-scalar.
    We will prove the second part of the statement of the proposition 4.2 if we show that for any
extended Dynkin graph G (and accordingly for G′ ⊃ G) and any quiver Q, such that G(Q) = G,
there exists indecomposable representation π Λ of the quiver Q which will not be unitarizable.
    If (d(i))i∈Gv — minimal imaginary root of the graph G (i. e. minimal positive root of the
equation BG (x) = 0) then such representation exists in the dimension 2d(i).
    Let, for definiteness, orientation of Q will be such that for any even vertex i all incident with
i arrows are “come into” vertex, and for odd — “come out” it.
    If all incident with i arrows “come into” vertex i then there exists (see, for instance, [10]) a
representation π Λ , for which

define a scalar product so as the continued representation π of the graph G will become a

Theorem 4.3. Let G — connected finite graph without cycles.
   1. Following conditions are equivalent:
   a) graph G is one of the Dynkin graphs An , Dn , E6 , E7 , E8 ;
   b) graph G is finitely representable in H;
   c) any finite-dimensional indecomposable representation of a quiver Q is unitarizable.
   2. A map π → (d(i), f (i)) where d(i) is a dimension of π and f (i) is a character of π
establishes a one-to-one correspondence between classes of equivalenc of the indecomposable
locally-scalar representations of a graph G and classes of equivalent root pairs of a graph G.

   Proof.
   1. a) implies b). Indeed, if G is a Dynkin graph then all representations of G are discrete
according to the proposition 3.6. All dimensions of indecomposable representations are bounded
in a whole since there a finite number of them (dimensions of indecomposable representations
are roots of a graph G by the proposition 3.7). In order to prove a finite representability of
G in H, obviously, it is enough to show that in Rep   g (G, d, f ) it is contained exactly one, up
to equivalence, object (corollary 3.8), and that two finite-dimensional representations π and
e from Rep (G) are unitary equivalent if and only if they have equal dimension d, common
π
character f and (π, f ) is equivalent to (e
                                          π , f ) in Rep (G, d, f ).
   b) implies a), since if G is not a Dynkin graph then it is not finitely representable by the
proposition 4.1 (it contains an extended Dynkin graph).
   a) and c) are equivalent by the proposition 4.2.

   2. If two locally-scalar representations π1 and π2 of a graph G are unitary equivalent and
indecomposable (and, consequently, finite-dimensional), then it is obvious that their dimensions
are equal, and their characters (uniquely determined) on the common support are equal too.
   Let locally-scalar indecomposable representations π1 and π2 have equal dimension d and equal
character f (on the common support characters are match, and out of the support we will define
                                                            ◦        •
them as equal). Then π1 and π2 have equal growth d =ct (ḡ) or ct (ḡ). Thus, pairs (π1 , f ),
                                         g (G, `) can be obtained from the simplest object
(π2 , f ) as the objects of the category Rep
(Πg , fg ) by the functors of the even and odd reflections (see the proof of the proposition 3.7)
and, therefore, match.

Remark 1. Even for Dynkin graphs indecomposable locally-scalar representations are not de-
termined uniquely by the character: there exist examples of indecomposable representations with
different dimensions but equal characters.

Remark 2. It is follows from our constructions that for Dynkin graphs (and, seemingly, only
for them) all locally-scalar representations realize over the field of the real numbers.
