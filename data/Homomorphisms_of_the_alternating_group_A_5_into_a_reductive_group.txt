                                                                                 Introduction
                                             0.1. Let A5 be the group defined by generators x2 , x3 , x5 and relations x22 = x33 =
                                             x55 = x2 x3 x5 = 1. It is well known that A5 is isomorphic to the alternating group
                                             in 5 letters. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p where p = 0
                                             or a prime ≥ 7. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over k. We shall
                                             be interested in the classification of homomorphisms A5 −      → G up to conjugation
                                             by G. When G = GLn this is the same as the classification of n-dimensional
                                             representations of A5 over k up to isomorphism; this can be reduced to the clas-
                                             sification of irreducible representations of A5 which is classical (there are five of
                                             them up to isomorphism, of degrees 1, 3, 3, 4, 5). In the general case, there is again
                                             something analogous to the notion of irreducible representation, which we call a
                                             regular homomorphism A5 −     → G. This is, by definition, a homomorphism A5 −    →G
                                             whose image is not contained in a Levi subgroup of a proper parabolic subgroup
                                             of G. Again the classification of homomorphisms A5 −     → G up to conjugacy can be
                                             more or less reduced to the analogous question for regular homomorphisms (for G
                                             and also for smaller groups).
                                                 D.D.Frey [F1],[F2],[F3] has classified up to conjugacy the homomorphisms (resp.
                                             non-regular homomorphisms) A5 −      → G for G of type E6 , E7 (resp. E8 ) over C. For
                                             G of type E8 he showed that there is at least one regular homomorphism A5 −      → G,
                                             but the problem of classifying up to conjugacy the regular homomorphisms A5 −       →
                                             G remained open.
                                                 Serre [S] has suggested that this problem could be attacked using the complex
                                             representation theory of E8 (Fq ), Fq a finite field. He showed that the number d of
                                             conjugacy classes of regular homomorphisms A5 −      → E8 (k) can be extracted from a
                                             certain sum over all irreducible characters of E8 (Fq ), if this sum can be computed.
                                                 The purpose of this paper is to show that this sum can be computed with enough
                                             precision so that a solution of the above problem is obtained. (See Theorem 4.5.)
                                             In fact, we show that d = 1. Thus, our results, in conjunction with the earlier

work of Frey, complete the classification up to G-conjugacy of homomorphisms
A5 −→ G for G adjoint simple.
   One of the key ingredients in our proof is a collection of inequalities (see 2.2)
involving representations of Weyl groups. While these inequalities are conjectural
in general, enough of them can be verified (with the aid of a computer) so that
the proof goes through.
   I want to thank R.Griess for introducing me to this problem. I also want to
thank J.-P.Serre for making [S] available to me and for some useful discussions.

                                   1. Examples
1.1. If G is a group we denote by ZG the centre of G and by Gder the derived
group of G; we set Gad = G/ZG . If g ∈ G let ZG (g) be the centralizer of g in
G and let CG (g) be the conjugacy class of g in G. If H is a subgroup of G let
ZG (H) (resp. NG (H)) be the centralizer (resp. normalizer) of H in G. If G, G′
are groups, let Hom(G, G′ ) be the set of group homomorphisms G −→ G′ .
                                                              0
   If G is an affine algebraic group over k (as in 0.1), let G be the identity
component of G and let Ḡ = G/G0 .
   For a finite set Y let Y or ♯(Y ) be the cardinal of Y .
1.2. Assume now that G is connected, reductive algebraic group over k of simply
laced type. Let π : G̃ − → G be the simply connected covering of Gder . Let T (G)
be the set of maximal tori in G. Let r(G) be the rank of G and let ν(G) be half
the number of roots of G.
    Since A5 is perfect, any homomorphism ψ : A5 −    → G has image contained in
Gder . This gives us a bijection between the set of G-orbits on Hom(A5 , G) and
the set of Gder -orbits on Hom(A5 , Gder ). Now, the obvious map from G-orbits on
Hom(A5 , G) to Gad -orbits on Hom(A5 , Gad ) is injective.
    (It is enough to show that, if ψ, ψ ′ ∈ Hom(A5 −→ G) are such that hψ = hψ ′
where h : G −   → Gad is the obvious map, then ψ = ψ ′ . For x ∈ A5 we have
  ′
ψ (x) = ψ(x)z(x) where z ∈ Hom(A5 , ZG ). Since A5 is perfect and ZG is abelian,
we have z(x) = 1 for all x, hence ψ = ψ ′ .)
Lemma
  P    1.3 (Serre [S]). Let ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G). We have
   n=2,3,5 dim ZG (ψ(xn )) = dim(G) + 2 dim ZG (ψ(A5 )).

    This is equivalent to its Lie algebra analogue
                         X
                               dim gψ(xn ) = dim g + 2 dim gA5
                       n=2,3,5

where g = Lie G, and the upper index denotes the fixed point set of the appropriate
automorphism or group of automorphisms of g. More generally, this holds when
g is replaced by a finite dimensional k-vector space V with an A5 -action; we may
assume that V is an irreducible representation of A5 (we have complete reducibility
       1
since 30  ∈ k) and in that case the equality is checked by direct computation.
HOMOMORPHISMS OF THE ALTERNATING GROUP A5 INTO REDUCTIVE GROUPS3

Lemma 1.4. If ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G), then ZG (ψ(A5 )) is a reductive group.
   Let C(n) = CG (ψ(xn )), n = 2, 3, 5. Then C(n) is an affine variety since ψ(xn ) is
a semisimple element. Consider the affine variety

                 X = {(g2 , g3 , g5 ) ∈ C(2) × C(3) × C(5); g2 g3 g5 = 1}.

The group G acts on X by conjugation on all factors. By 1.3, the dimension of
the G-orbit of (g2 , g3 , g5 ) ∈ X equals
                       X                                        X
         dim(G) − (             dim ZG (gn ) − dim(G))/2 =               dim C(n)/2;
                      n=2,3,5                                  n=2,3,5


in particular it is independent of the choice (g2 , g3 , g5 ). Since any G-orbit of
minimum dimension must be closed in X, it follows that any G-orbit in X is
closed in X; hence it is affine. By a known criterion (Richardson) it follows that
the isotropy group in G of any point of X is reductive. The lemma is proved.
Lemma 1.5. The following four conditions for ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G) are equivalent:
  (i) dim ZG (ψ(A5 )) = dim ZG ;
  (ii) ZG (ψ(A5 ))/ZG is finite;
                                                     0
  (iii) any subtorus
               P     of ZG (ψ(A5 )) is contained in ZG ;
                            0
  (iv) ν(G) − n=2,3,5 ν(ZG (ψ(xn ))) = r(Gad ).
   This follows from Lemmas 1.3, 1.4.
1.6. We say that ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G) is regular if the conditions of Lemma 1.5
are satisfied. Let Homreg (A5 , G) = {ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G); ψ regular}. Note that
ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G) is regular if and only if its image in Hom(A5 , Gad ) is regular.
   We show that the classification of homomorphisms ψ : A5 −      → G up to G-
conjugacy can be essentially reduced to the analogous problem for regular ho-
momorphisms. Let ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G). Let S be a maximal torus of ZG (ψ(A5 ))
and let L = ZG (S). (A Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup of G.) Using
1.5(iii), we see that ψ defines a regular homomorphism A5 − → L. This gives us
a bijection between the set of G-orbits on Hom(A5 , G) and the disjoint union
over all G-conjugacy classes of Levi subgroups L of the sets of NG (L)-orbits on
Homreg (A5 , L).
1.7. A 235 -triple for G is a triple (C2 , C3 , C5 ) of conjugacy classes in G such that,
if gn ∈ Cn , then gnn = 1, n = 2, 3, 5. The type of a 235 -triple is by definition the
                                                                          0
sequence X2 , X3 , X5 where Xn is the type of the root system of ZG         (gn ). Clearly,
G has only finitely many 235 -triples. As pointed out in [S], of particular interest
are the 235 -triples (C2 , C3 , C5 ) in G such that
                                     X
                                                 0
                          ν(G) −              ν(ZG (gn )) = r(Gad )
                                    n=2,3,5
4                                         G. LUSZTIG

where gn ∈ Cn . Such 235 -triples are called regular. If ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) and
Cn = CG (ψ(xn )), n = 2, 3, 5 then (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is a regular 235 -triple.
   Let ι be an automorphism of order 2 of A5 such that ι(x2 ) is conjugate to x2 ,
ι(x3 ) is conjugate to x3 , ι(x5 ) is conjugate to x25 . For any ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G) let ι ψ =
ψ ◦ ι. If (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is a regular 235 -triple of G, then ι (C2 , C3 , C5 ) = (C2 , C3 , C5′ ),
where C5′ = {g 2 ; g ∈ C5 }, is again a regular 235 -triple of G.
1.8. Assume that G = Gad is simple of type Am−1 . If m ∈ {2, 3} then G
has exactly two regular 235 -triples (interchanged by ι) and there are exactly two
ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) up to conjugacy (interchanged by ι). If m = 4, then G has
exactly one regular 235 -triple and there are exactly two ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) up to
conjugacy. If m ∈ {5, 6} then G has exactly one regular 235 -triple and there is
exactly one ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) up to conjugacy. If m ≥ 7, then G has no regular
235 -triple and therefore Homreg (A5 , G) = ∅.
   The type of a regular 235 -triple is (∅, ∅, ∅) (if m = 2),(A1 , ∅, ∅) (if m = 3),
   2
(A1 , A1 , ∅) (if m = 4), (A2 A1 , A21 , ∅) (if m = 5), (A22 , A31 , A1 ) (if m = 6).
   For m = 3, 5 (resp. m = 2, 6), ψ comes from an irreducible m-dimensional
representation of A5 (resp. of the duble cover SL2 (F5 ) of A5 , regarded as a
projective representation of A5 ). For m = 4, one ψ comes from an irreducible
4-dimensional representation of A5 , the other ψ comes from an irreducible 4-
dimensional representation of SL2 (F5 ) which does not factor through A5 .
1.9. Assume that G = Gad is simple of type Dm .
   (a) If m = 4, then G has exactly four regular 235 -triples: two of type
(A41 , A31 , ∅) (interchanged by ι) and two of type (A41 , A2 , ∅) (interchanged by ι);
correspondingly, it has exactly four ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) up to conjugacy: two of
them (interchanged by ι) come from 8-dimensional orthogonal representations of
A5 which decompose as 1 + 3 + 4 into irreducibles and two of them (interchanged
by ι) come from 8-dimensional orthogonal representations of A5 which decompose
as 3 + 5 into irreducibles.
   (b) If m = 5, then G has exactly one regular 235 -triple; it has type
(A3 A21 , A2 A21 , A21 ); also G has exactly two ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) up to conjugacy;
one of them comes from a 10-dimensional orthogonal representation of A5 which
decomposes as 3 + 3 + 4 into irreducibles; the other comes from a 10-dimensional
orthogonal representation of A5 which decomposes as 1 + 4 + 5 into irreducibles.
   (c) If m = 6, then G has exactly three regular 235 -triples; one has type
   2
(A3 , A3 A21 , A41 ) and the other two (interchanged by ι) have type
(A23 , A3 A21 , A2 A1 ); correspondingly, it has exactly three ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) up
to conjugacy: one of them comes from a 12-dimensional orthogonal representation
of A5 which decomposes as 1 + 3 + 3 + 5 into irreducibles; the other two (inter-
changed by ι) come from 12-dimensional orthogonal representations of A5 which
decompose as 3 + 4 + 5 into irreducibles.
   (d) If m = 8, then G has exactly one regular 235 -triple; it has type
(D4 A3 , A4 A3 , A22 A21 ); it also has exactly one ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) up to conjugacy:
HOMOMORPHISMS OF THE ALTERNATING GROUP A5 INTO REDUCTIVE GROUPS5

it comes from a 16-dimensional orthogonal representation of A5 which decomposes
as 1 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 into irreducibles.
    If m = 7 or m > 9 then G has no regular 235 -triples; therefore,
Homreg (A5 , G) = ∅.
    We see that in these cases each regular ψ comes from a homomorphism A5 − →
SO2m .
1.10. Assume that G = Gad is simple of type Em . From [F1], [F2],[F3] we see
that:
   if m = 6, then G has exactly two regular 235 -triples (interchanged by ι); they
have type (A5 A1 , A32 , A2 A21 );
   if m = 7, then G has exactly two regular 235 -triples (interchanged by ι); they
have type (A7 , A5 A2 , A3 A2 A1 );
   if m = 8, then G has exactly one regular 235 -triple; it has type (D8 , A8 , A24 ).
From [F1],[F2],[F3] we see also that in each of these cases, a regular 235 -triple is
associated with at least one ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G). (Another proof of this fact is
given by Lemma 4.3.) This ψ is in fact unique up to conjugacy. (See [F2], [F3] for
E6 , E7 and p = 0; see 4.5, 4.6 for the general case.)

                                   2. Inequalities
2.1. Let W be a Weyl group and let V be the reflection representation of W (over
C). Let V = ⊕j≥0 Vj be the algebra of polynomials V −            → C modulo the ideal
generated by the W -invariant polynomials of degree > 0; here Vj is the image of
the space of polynomials of degree j. Now dim V = W and W acts naturally
on V preserving the grading. Let E(W ) be the set of irreducible representations
of W over C (up to isomorphism). For any E ∈ E(W ) let bW (E) (resp. b′W (E))
be the smallest (resp. largest) integer j such that HomW (E, Vj ) 6= 0. Note that
bW (E), b′W (E) are well defined.
    Assume now that W is the Weyl group of G as in 1.2. Let ν = ν(G). Let
(C2 , C3 , C5 ) be a 235 -triple for G. Let (g2 , g3 , g5 ) ∈ C2 × C3 × C5 . We denote
by Wn (resp. by νn ) the Weyl group (resp. the number of positive roots) of
  0
ZG  (gn ), n = 2, 3, 5. We may regard W2 , W3 , W5 as Weyl subgroups of W . Let
V(n) = ⊕j V(n) be defined in terms of Wn in the same way as V = ⊕j Vj is defined
in terms of W . For any E ∈ E(W ) let bn (E) (resp. b′n (E)) be the smallest (resp.
                                                  (n)
largest) integer j such that HomWn (E|Wn , Vj ) 6= 0. Note that bn (E), b′n(E) are
well defined for n = 2, 3, 5.
    Let sgn be the sign representation of W . We have
(a)     b(E) = ν − b′ (E ⊗ sgn),    bn (E) = νn − b′n (E ⊗ sgn),    n = 2, 3, 5.
Now E(W ) is a union of equivalence classes called families, see [L, 4.2]. For example
the unit representation 1 is a family by itself. If F is a family, then {E⊗sgn; E ∈ F }
is again a family. For any family F of W we set
                      a(F ) = min b(E),     a′ (F ) = max b′ (E),
                              E∈F                    E∈F
6                                   G. LUSZTIG

                    an (F ) = min bn (E),   a′n (F ) = max b′n (E).
                             E∈F                      E∈F

From (a) we deduce that

(b)    a(F ) = ν − a′ (F ⊗ sgn),   an (F ) = νn − a′n (F ⊗ sgn),      n = 2, 3, 5.

Proposition 2.2. In the setup of 2.1, assume that either
    (1) (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is regular, or
    (2) any simple component of Gad has rank ≤ 8 and is not of type E8 .
Then for any family
                  P       F we have
    (a) a(F ) − n=2,3,5 an (F ) ≤ r(Gad );
equivalently
        P      (see 2.1(b)),                P
    (b) n=2,3,5 a′n (F ) − a′ (F ) ≤ −ν + n νn + r(Gad ).
Moreover, if (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is not regular, then (a) and (b) are strict inequalities.
If (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is regular, then (a) is strict for F =6 {sgn} and (b) is strict for
F= 6 {1}. If (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is regular, then (a) is an equality for F = {sgn} and (b)
is an equality for F = {1}.
   This can be checked with the aid of a computer. We may assume that G = Gad
is simple. In the case where G is of type E8 and (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is regular, I have
used tables in [BL], [A]. If we are not in this case then G has rank ≤ 8 and is not
of type E8 . Then, instead of [BL], [A], one can use the CHEVIE package [C] to
get tables for the quantities bn (E) (or rather the analogous quantities where Wn is
replaced by any reflection subgroup of W ). From this information, one can check
the required inequalities by hand. (I am grateful to M. Geck for his help with the
CHEVIE package.)
2.3. We expect that 2.2 continues to hold even if we drop the assumptions (1),(2).
One can check that 2.2(a),(b) hold for G of type A without the assumptions
     P When (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is regular, then 2.2(a) for F = {sgn} is just the equality
(1),(2).
ν − n=2,3,5 νn = r(Gad ).
2.4. We illustrate 2.2(a) in the case when G = Gad is of type E8 and (C2 , C3 , C5 )
is regular. The subgroups Wn of W are as in 1.10. In the following list, there is
one line for each family F of W , containing the information
   D; a(F ) − a2 (F ) − a3 (F ) − a5 (F ) =?
where D is the degree of the ”special” representation in F . Note that F is deter-
mined by D and a(F ).

                               3. Fq -structures
3.1. In this section we fix G as in 1.2. We assume that p is a prime ≥ 7 and that
k is an algebraic closure of the field with p elements. Let q be a power of p and
8                                     G. LUSZTIG

let Fq be the subfield of k with q elements. Let F : G − → G be the Frobenius map
corresponding to an Fq -rational structure on G.
   For any integer m ≥ 1 we write m = mp mp′ where mp is a power of p and mp′
is prime to p. If φ is a map of a set Y into itself, we set Y φ = {y ∈ Y ; φ(y) = y}.
3.2. Let ǫG = (−1)Fq −rank of G . For any T ∈ T (G)F and any ϑ ∈ Hom(T F , C∗ )
      θ
let RT,G   : GF −→ C be the character of the virtual representation denoted in [DL,
            θ
4.3] by RT . (We choose a prime number l, l 6= p, an algebraic closure Q̄l of the
l-adic numbers and a field isomorphism Q̄l ∼ = C; then RTθ , a virtual representation
over Q̄l , can be viewed as a virtual representation over C.) Let E(GF ) be the set
of irreducible (complex) characters of GF . Let E1 (GF ) be the set of irreducible
unipotent characters of GF that is, the irreducible characters ρ of GF such that
        1
(ρ : RT,G   )G 6= 0 for some T ∈ T F . Here (:)G is the standard hermitian inner
product of class functions GF −  → C. Let O(GF ) be the set of all class functions
φ : GF −   → C such that (φ : RT,G θ
                                       )G = 0 for any T ∈ T (G)F and any ϑ ∈
Hom(T F , C∗ ).
Lemma 3.3. Let ρ ∈ E1 (GF ). There exists a unique GF -invariant function f ρ :
T (G)F −
       → C and a unique ξ ∈ O(GF ) such that
                              −1     X
                     ρ = GF                    T F f ρ (T )RT,G

                                   T ∈T (G)F


   This follows immediately from the definition of E1 (GF ) and from the orthogo-
nality relations [DL, 6.8].
Lemma 3.4. Let g ∈ GF be semisimple. Let T ∈ T (G)F , ϑ ∈ Hom(T F , C∗ ). We
have
                                     −1          X
           RTϑ (g) = ǫZG0 (g) ǫT T F    ZG (g) ′        ϑ(g ′ ).

    See [DL, 7.2].
3.5. For any GF -invariant function f : T (G)F −
                                               → C let
                                    −1     X
                     Rf,G = GF                       T F f (T )RT,G
                                                                1

                                         T ∈T (G)F


If H is a connected reductive F -stable subgroup of G with r(H) = r(G) and f is
as above, we shall write Rf,H instead of Rf |T (H)F ,H .
                                                P
Lemma 3.6. In the setup of 3.5 we have               T ∈T (G)F   ǫG ǫT f (T ) = GF p Rf,G (1).
                                                                1
   Rf,G (1) may be computed using the formula in [DL, 7.1] for RT,G (1); the lemma
follows.

3.7. We denote by GF                   F                                 F    ∗
                          ∗ (resp. G⋄ ) the group of all θ ∈ Hom(G , C ) such that
θ|π(G̃)F = 1 (resp. θ|π(G̃F ) = 1). Clearly, GF         F
                                                   ∗ ⊂ G⋄ .
   If T ∈ T (G)F and ϑ ∈ Hom(T F , C∗ ), let S(T, ϑ) be the subgroup of G defined
as in [DL, 5.19]. If H is an F -stable connected reductive subgroup of G with
                        F
r(H) = r(G), let H♠       be the set of all θ ∈ H⋄F such that for some (or equivalently,
any) T ∈ T (H)F we have S(T, θ|T F ) = H. Let H♥         F
                                                            be the set of all θ ∈ H⋄F such
that θ = θ ′ θ ′′ for some θ ′ ∈ H♠
                                  F
                                    , θ ′′ ∈ H∗F .
   Let XG,F be the set of all pairs (H, θ) where H is an F -stable connected re-
                                                            F         ′
ductive subgroup of G with r(H) = r(G) and θ ∈ H♠             . Let XG,F  be the set of all
                                                                     F
F -stable connected reductive subgroups H of G such that H♠ 6= ∅.
                             0            ′
Lemma 3.8. Assume that ZG = ZG . Let H ∈ XG,F . Then any orbit of the
obvious NG (H)F -action on H♠
                            F
                              has cardinal NG (H)F /H F .
              F
   Let θ ∈ H♠   . Let Sθ be the stabilizer of θ in NG (H)F . We show that Sθ = H F .
The inclusion H F ⊂ Sθ is immediate. Now let g ∈ Sθ . We must show that
g ∈ H F . Let T ∈ T (H)F be maximally split. Since gHg −1 = H, we see that
gT g −1 ∈ T (H)F is maximally split hence gT g −1 = hT h−1 for some h ∈ H F .
Replacing g by gh−1 we see that we may assume that gT g −1 = T . Now conjugation
by g keeps fixed θ|T F . By [DL, 5.13], g is a product of elements in NH (T ). In
particular, g ∈ H. Hence g ∈ H F . The lemma is proved.
3.9. Let (H, θ) ∈ XG,F . Let EH,θ (G) be the set of all ρ ∈ E(GF ) such that
      θT
(ρ : RT,G )G 6= 0 for some T ∈ T (H)F . (We write θT instead of θ|T F .) According
                              0
to [DL, 6.3, 5.20], if ZG = ZG  , we have a partition
   (a) E(GF ) = ⊔(H,θ) EH,θ (GF )
where (H, θ) runs over a set of representatives for the GF -orbits on XG,F .
                                  0
   According to [L], if ZG = ZG     , for any (H, θ) ∈ XG,F , there exists κ ∈ {1, −1}
and a bijection
   (b) E1 (H F ) ↔ EH,θ (GF )
(denoted by ρ ↔ ρH,θ ) such that for any ρ ∈ E1 (H F ) and any T ∈ T (H)F we have
      1                   θT
(ρ : RT,H )H = κ(ρH,θ : RT,G  )G .

   To prove the identity in (a) it is enough to show that both sides have the same
                     θ ′
inner product with RTT′ ,G for any T ′ ∈ T (H)F . By [DL, 6.8], the inner product of
                              ′              θ
the right hand side with RTT′ ,G is

                X         f ρ (T )
(d)       κ                          ♯(g1 ∈ GF ; g1 T g1−1 = T ′ , Ad(g1 ) carries θT to θT ′ )

For any g1 in (d) we see that Ad(g1 ) carries S(T, θT ) to S(T ′ , θT ′ ) hence it carries
(H, θ) to (H, θ). By the argument in the proof of 3.8 we have g1 ∈ H F . Thus, (d)
is equal to

This proves (a). We prove (b). By [DL, 7.5] we have ξ ′ (g) = 0. Hence

3.16. Let H be an F -stable connected reductive subgroup of G such that r(H) =
r(G). Let W be the Weyl group of G and let W ′ be the Weyl group of H. Note
that F acts naturally on W and on W ′ .
   Let T0 , B0 be a pair consisting of an F -stable maximal torus of G and an F -
stable Borel subgroup of G containing T0 . Let T0′ , B0′ be a pair consisting of an
F -stable maximal torus of H and an F -stable Borel subgroup of H containing T0′ .
We identify W = NG (T0 )/T0 , W ′ = NH (T0′ )/T0′ in the standard way. We choose
γ ∈ G such that γT0 γ −1 = T0′ . Let m = γ −1 F (γ). We have m ∈ NG (T0 ). We have
an imbedding W ′ ⊂ W induced by NH (T0′ ) −    → NG (T0 ), h 7→ γ −1 hγ. We identify
W ′ with its image under this imbedding. The map F : W ′ −       → W ′ corresponds
                                                             ′
under this identification to the restriction of the map F : W −    → W induced by
                                    −1
NG (T0 ) −→ NG (T0 ), g 7→ mF (g)m .
   Let E be an irreducible representation of W with a given isomorphism λE :
E− → E of finite order such that λE (we) = F (w)λE (e) for all w ∈ W, e ∈ E.
   Define fE : T (G)F −  → C by fE (T ) = tr(wT λE : E −→ E) where wT is the image
in W of z F (z) ∈ NG (T0 ) where z ∈ G is such that zT0 z −1 = T . (Note that
            −1

fE (T ) is independent of the choice of z.)
   Define Vj′ in terms of W ′ in the same way as Vj was defined in 2.1 in terms of W .
Then W ′ acts naturally on Vj′ and there is a natural isomorphism λj : Vj′ −    → Vj′
                                ′       ′   ′              ′     ′        ′
of finite order such that λj (w x) = F (w )λj (x) for all w ∈ W , x ∈ Vj .
   We define a linear map λ̃j : HomW ′ (E, Vj′ ) −→ HomW ′ (E, Vj′ ) by (λ̃j (ξ))(e) =
λ−1                                       ′
  j ξ(mλE (e)) for all ξ ∈ HomW ′ (E, Vj ), e ∈ E. (One checks easily that λ̃j (ξ) ∈

Let T be a maximal torus of ZH (g ) such that F T ′ = T ′ . We can find x ∈ H

such that xgx−1 = g ′ , xT x−1 = T ′ . Let m = x−1 F (x). Then m ∈ ZH (g) and

RG , RH , R′G , R′H . Let R′G + , R′H + be a set of positive roots for R′G , R′H respec-
tively. It is well known that

Now Ad(x) establishes bijections RG = R′G and RH ∼            = R′H under which the
                        ′     ′
action of F on RG , RH corresponds to the action given by Ad(m) on RG , RH
(since F acts trivially on RG , RH ). Also under this bijection, R′G + (resp. R′H + )
corresponds to a set of positive roots R+                 +
                                                G (resp. RH ) for RG (resp. RH ). It

            (g ′ ) = (−1)                           .
The right hand sides of the previous two equalities may be also interpreted as the
determinant of the linear map induced by Ad(m) on the group of characters of
                                                                  0          0
T . (We use that m defines an element in the Weyl group of ZG        (g) or ZH (g) with
respect to T .) Hence those right hand sides coincide. It follows that (a) holds.
   Now Ad(x) also induces an isomorphism Z̄H (g) ∼       = Z̄H (g ′ ) under which the
action of F on Z̄H (g ′ ) corresponds to the action of Ad(m) on Z̄H (g) (since F acts
trivially on Z̄H (g)). Hence to prove (b) it is enough to show that Ad(m) acts
trivially on Z̄H (g). Since m ∈ ZH (g), this follows from the well known fact that
Z̄H (g) is commutative. The lemma is proved.
3.18. In this subsection we assume that (H, F ) is like (G, F ) in 3.1. We assume
that H = Hder and that C is a semisimple conjugacy class in H. Let a ∈ C. We
assume that F (a) = a and that F acts trivially on Z̄H (a). We assume also that
F acts trivially on Z = ZH̃ .

   (a) Define µ : Z −
z. Then µ is a group isomorphism.
The proof is standard.
   Let Z ′ be the set of all z ∈ Z such that ã, zã are conjugate in H̃; here ã ∈
π −1 (a) ⊂ H̃. (This definition does not depend on the choice of ã.) Note that Z ′

is a subgroup of Z. Let X be the set of H F -conjugacy classes contained in C F .
   (b) Define µ′ : Z ′ −→ X by z 7→ CH F (π(g)aπ(g)−1) where g ∈ H̃ is such that
                     −1

The proof is standard.
                                   µ
   (c) The composition Z ′ −→ Z − → H F /π(H̃ F ) (the first map is the inclusion)
                                      µ′
coincides with the composition Z ′ −→ X −       → H F /π(H̃ F ) (the second map is A 7→
π(g) where g ∈ A).
This follows from the definitions.
    (d) Assume that N ≥ 1 is an integer such that aN = 1. Then z N = 1 for all
z ∈ Z′.
Indeed if z ∈ Z ′ we have zã = gãg −1 for some g ∈ G. Taking N -th powers gives
z N ãN = gãN g −1 hence (using ãN ∈ Z): z N ãN = gg −1 ãN = ãN , hence z N = 1.
    Assume now that (C2′ , C3′ , C5′ ) is a 235 -triple for H. Let an ∈ Cn′ , n = 2, 3, 5.
We assume that F (an ) = an and F acts trivially on Z̄H (an ) for n = 2, 3, 5.
    Let Zn′ , Xn be defined like Z ′ , X in terms of Cn′ , an instead of C, a.
    (e) The map X2 × X3 × X5 −    → H F /π(H̃ F ), given by (A, B, C) 7→ π(abc) where
(a, b, c) ∈ A × B × C, is injective.
Using (a),(b),(c), we see that this is equivalent to the statement that the map
Z2′ × Z3′ × Z5′ −
                → Z given by multiplication in Z is injective. From (d) we see that
any element z ∈ Zn′ satisfies z n = 1. Then the injectivity of the map above follows
from the fact that an element of a finite abelian group can be written in at most
one way as a product of elements of order dividing 2, 3, 5.
                                                                               ′
    In the remainder of this subsection we assume in addition that H ∈ XG,F       where
(G, F ) as in 3.1 is such that G = Gad , G simple of type Em , m = 6, 7, 8. (Recall
that H = Hder .)
    (f) The image I of the map in (e) is exactly U = {x ∈ H F /π(H̃ F ); x30 = 1}.
By (d), we have I ⊂ U . Now I = Z2′ Z3′ Z5′ and U can be easily determined
by inspection of the various cases. We find that I = U hence I = U .
  ((f) ought to be true also in type D, but we have not checked it, as we don’t
need it.) In particular, the map in (e) is a bijection except if (G, H) is of type
(E8 , D5 × A3 ) or (E7 , A3 × A3 × A1 ) in which case the image has index 2.
Lemma 3.19. Assume that G = Gad . Let F0 : G −           → G be the Frobenius map
corresponding to an Fp -rational structure on G. There exists an integer s0 ≥ 1
                                                            ′
such that if s ≥ 1 is an integer divisible by s0 , and H ∈ XG,F s is semisimple, then
                                                                0
H is split over Fps .
    Let G∗ be as in the proof of 3.15. Let F0′ : G∗ − → G∗ be the Frobenius map
                                                 ∗
corresponding to an Fp -rational structure on G . As in the proof of 3.15, we see
that it is enough to verify the following statement:
    (a) There exists an integer s0 ≥ 1 such that if s ≥ 1 is an integer divisible by
                  ′s
s0 , and g ∈ G∗F0 is a semisimple element such that H = ZG∗ (g) is semisimple,
then H is split over Fps .

The set of all g ′ ∈ G∗ such that g ′ is semisimple and ZG∗ (g ′ ) is semisimple is a
union of finitely many conjugacy classes A1 , A2 , . . . , Am in G∗ . Pick gr ∈ Ar for
                                                                                       ′ s0
r ∈ [1, m]. Let Hr = ZG∗ (gr ). We can find an integer s0 ≥ 1 such that gr ∈ G∗F0
and Hr is split over Fps0 , r = 1, . . . , m. If s ≥ 1 is an integer divisible by s0 then
           ′s                                                                  ′s
gr ∈ G∗F0 and Hr is split over Fps , r = 1, . . . , m. Now let g ∈ G∗F0 be such
                                                                                                  F ′s
that H = ZG∗ (g) is semisimple. We have g ∈ Ar for some r. Hence g ∈ Ar 0 .
                                                                            ′s
Now ZG∗ (gr ) is connected since G∗ is simply connected. It follows that G∗F acts
                                    F ′s
transitively (by conjugation) on Ar 0 . In particular, g, gr are conjugate under
    ′s
G∗F . It follows that H = ZG∗ (g) is split over Fps . The lemma is proved.

                                             4. Estimates
Lemma 4.1. Let G, q, F be as in 3.1. Let A, B, C be conjugacy classes in GF such
that A ⊂ C2 , B ⊂ C3 , C ⊂ C5 where (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is a 235 -triple in G. Assume that
the assumptions of 2.2 hold. Then |GG,F ;A,B,C | ≤ c where c is a constant de-
pending only on G (not on F, q, A, B, C). Moreover, if (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is not regular,
then |GG,F ;A,B,C | ≤ c′ q −1 where c′ is a constant depending only on G (not on
F, q, A, B, C).
   We use the notation of 2.1. We may assume that (g2 , g3 , g5 ) ∈ A × B × C. Now
F acts naturally on W . Hence it acts naturally on the set of families of W . By
[L, 4.23] we have a partition
   E1 (GF ) = ⊔F E1,F (GF )
(F runs over the F -stable families in W ) such that the following holds: if ρ ∈
E1,F (GF ), then                      X
                                fρ =     sρ,E fE ,
                                                     E

where E runs through the representations in F that are ”F -stable”, sρ,E are
complex numbers that are bounded above (when q varies) and fE : T (G)F −→C
is as in 3.16. Using 3.16(a) we see that

fact it is known that the coefficient of q a (F) is non-zero and its inverse is bounded
above. Now          P
   GG,F ;A,B,C = F GG,F ;A,B,C,F
where F runs over the F -stable families in W and GG,F ;A,B,C,F is defined like
GG,F ;A,B,C but with ρ restricted to E1,F (GF ). The arguments above show, us-
ing 2.2(b), that each GG,F ;A,B,C,F is bounded above; and, in the case where
(C2 , C3 , C5 ) is not regular, that each qGG,F ;A,B,C,F is bounded above. The lemma
follows.
4.2. In the setup of 4.1, assume that (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is regular. By the method of
4.1, we see that
   (a) q(GG,F ;A,B,C − 1) is bounded above.
Lemma 4.3. Let G be as in 3.1. Let (C2 , C3 , C5 ) be a regular 235 -triple in Gder .
Then there exists ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , G) such that ψ gives rise to (C2 , C3 , C5 ) as in 1.7.
   Since this statement depends only on Gder and we can find an imbedding of
Gder into a connected reductive group with connected centre and derived subgroup
Gder , we see that we may assume that G has connected centre. We may also assume
that dim G > 0 and that the lemma is true when G is replaced by a group whose
derived group has strictly smaller dimension than that of Gder . Assume that there
is no ψ as in the lemma (for G). Let (g2 , g3 , g5 ) ∈ C2 × C3 × C5 . Since gn ∈ Gder ,
we may choose q, F as in 3.1 in such a way that gn ∈ π(G̃F ) for n = 2, 3, 5. We
                              0         0         0
may also assume that G, ZG      (g2 ), ZG (g3 ), ZG (g5 ) are split over Fq and that q is
large.
   We write the identity in 3.13 for (A, B, C) = (CGF (g2 ), CGF (g3 ), CGF (g5 )). The
left hand side of that identity is 0, by our assumption. We deduce that

   We show that         is bounded above. In each term, tG,F ;H;A,B,C;A′ ,B′ ,C ′ is
bounded above (by 3.14), GH,F ;A′ ,B′ ,C ′ is bounded above (by 4.1) and it is enough

        P
that θ∈H F θ(a′ b′ c′ ) = 0. Since H♥       F
                                              is a union of H∗F -cosets in H⋄F , it is enough
                    ♥
to show that a′ b′ c′ ∈        / Hder . Assume that a′ b′ c′ ∈ Hder for some (hence any)
(a′ , b′ , c′ ) ∈ A′ × B ′ × C ′ . Since a′ , b′ , c′ have orders dividing 2, 3, 5, it follows
that each of a′ , b′ , c′ is in Hder . Hence Ã′ , B̃ ′ , C̃ ′ are contained in Hder . Since
(Ã′ , B̃ ′ , C̃ ′ ) is regular in H, we may apply to it the induction hypothesis; we see
that there exists ψ ∈ Hom(A5 , H) such that ψ(x2 ) ∈ Ã′ , ψ(x3 ) ∈ B̃ ′ , ψ(x5 ) ∈ C̃ ′ .
Since Ã′ ⊂ C2 , B̃ ′ ⊂ C3 , C̃ ′ ⊂ C5 , we see that ψ(xn ) ∈ Cn for n = 2, 3, 5. This
contradicts
P′                   our assumption. Thus, we have a′ b′ c′ ∈ / Hder and the boundedness of
      (hence (b)) is established.
    Using now (a), we deduce that qXG,F ;G;A,B,C is bounded above. Setting t =
tG,F ;G;A,B,C;A,B,C , G = GG,F ;A,B,C , we have

since g2 g3 g5 ∈ π(G̃F ). From 3.14(b) we see that t−1 is bounded above and it is
                  0
                         −1
clear that q dim ZG GF
                     ⋄   is bounded above. It follows that qG is bounded above.
This contradicts 4.2. The lemma is proved.
4.4. Assume now that G (as in 1.2) is adjoint of type E8 and that (C2 , C3 , C5 ) is
the unique regular 235 triple of G. Let d be the number of G-orbits on
Homreg (A5 , G). To determine d we may assume that k is as in 3.1. Let q, F be
as in 3.1. We write the identity 3.11(a) for (A, B, C) = (C2F , C3F , C5F ) (these are
three conjugacy classes of GF ). Assume that we can evaluate the right hand side
of 3.11(a) for infinitely many q and that it is of the form ∆q D + lower powers of q
where ∆ is a constant. Then 3.11(a) implies that {(a, b, c) ∈ C2 ×C3 ×C5 ; abc = 1}
has exactly ∆ irreducible components of dimension D and it follows that d = ∆.
(This strategy was suggested in [S].)
Theorem 4.5. Let G be as in 1.2 and let (C2 , C3 , C5 ) be a regular                         235 -triple   of
G. Assume that G = Gad . Let N = ZG̃ . Let gn ∈ Cn and let Nn = Z̄G (gn ) ,

n = 2, 3, 5. Then, up to G-conjugacy, there are exactly               N2 N3 N5   elements ψ ∈
Homreg (A5 , G) that give rise to (C2 , C3 , C5 ).
    We may assume that G is simple. In the case where G is of type A or D, the
theorem can be obtained from the results in §1. In the rest of the proof we assume
that G is of type Em , m = 6, 7, 8 (although the same proof should work without
this assumption).
    We will carry out the strategy in 4.4, using the results in §2, §3. We may assume
that k is as in 3.1. Let F0 be a Frobenius map for an Fp -rational structure on G.
            ′        ′
Let q = ps , F = F0s where s′ is sufficiently large and divisible by a fixed integer
s′0 ≥ 1. By choosing s′0 apropriately we may assume that F acts trivially on ZG̃
that gn ∈ π(G̃F ), that ZG0
                            (gn ) is split over Fq and that F acts trivially on Z̄G (gn )
for n = 2, 3, 5. (The choice of s′0 will be made more precise later in the proof.) Let
δ = 3ν − ν2 − ν3 − ν5 . (Notation of 2.1.) Let ∆ = N2 NN3 N5 . We will show that

(a)               q(q −δ ♯{(g2 , g3 , g5 ) ∈ C2F × C3F × C5F ; g2 g3 g5 = 1} − ∆)

is bounded above when q varies or equivalently, that

          q(q −δ        ♯{(g2 , g3 , g5 ) ∈ A × B × C; g2 g3 g5 = 1} − ∆)
                          (A,B,C)∈X

is bounded above. Here X is the set of triples (A, B, C) of conjugacy classes in
GF such Pthat A ⊂ C2 , B ⊂ C3 , C ⊂ C5 . By 3.13, it is enough to show that
   (b) q( (A,B,C)∈X XG,F ;G;A,B,C − ∆) is bounded above,

(c) q (A,B,C)∈X XG,F ;H;A,B,C is bounded above for any H ∈ X¯G,F   ′

where (a, b, c) ∈ A × B × C. The sum over θ is 0 unless abc ∈ π(G̃F ) (or equiva-
lently, each of a, b, c is in π(G̃F )), in which case it is N . Thus, (b) is equivalent to
the statement that
   q(tG,F ;G;A,B,C;A,B,C GG,F ;A,B,C N − ∆) is bounded above;
here (A, B, C) ∈ X is uniquely determined by the condition
   A ⊂ π(G̃F ), B ⊂ π(G̃F ), C ⊂ π(G̃F ).
This follows from the fact that q(tG,F ;G;A,B,C;A,B,C − (N2 N3 N5 )−1 ) is bounded
above (see 3.14, 3.17) and q(GG,F ;A,B,C − 1) is bounded above (see 4.2). Thus, (b)
holds.

to show that a′ b′ c′ ∈          / Hder . Assume that a′ b′ c′ ∈ Hder for some (hence any)
(a′ , b′ , c′ ) ∈ A′ × B ′ × C ′ . Since a′ , b′ , c′ have orders dividing 2, 3, 5, it follows
that each of a′ , b′ , c′ is in Hder . Hence Ã′ , B̃ ′ , C̃ ′ are contained in Hder . Since

    Next, assume that dim ZH = 0. We show that                                       is bounded above. Since for

tG,F ;H;A,B,C;A′ ,B′ ,C ′ is bounded above (see 3.14), it is enough to show that, for

that F acts trivially on ZH̃ , that Cn′ contains an Fq -rational point hn such that

we see then that, in the last fraction, the numerator is 1 and the denominator
is Z̄H (h2 ) Z̄H (h3 ) Z̄H (h5 ) ; in particular, τA′ ,B′ ,C ′ is independent of A′ , B ′ , C ′ .

Using the results at the end of 3.18, we see that the last equality is equivalent to
the equality
   P
      x∈H F /π(H̃ F );x30 =1 θ(x) = 0
where θ is regarded as a character of H F /π(H̃ F ). More precisely, P     if (G, H) is not of
type (E8 , D5 ×A3 ) or (E7 , A3 ×A3 ×A1 ), we must show that x∈H F /π(H̃ F ) θ(x) = 0
                                                                   F
and this follows from the fact that θ 6= 1 (since θ ∈ H♠             ). If (G, H) is of type
(E8 , D5 × A3 ) or (E7 , A3 × A3 × A1 ), we must show that the restriction of θ to
the subgroup of H F /π(H̃ F ) (∼      = Z/4Z or ∼
                                                = Z/4Z ⊕ Z/2Z) consisting of all x such

that x = 1 is 6= 1; this again follows from θ ∈ H♠         .
   This proves (c). Thus, (a) is proved.
   Let X = {(a, b, c) ∈ C2 ×C3 ×C5 ; abc = 1} (an algebraic variety defined over Fq ).
                                                                                      s
From (a) we see that there exists an integer M > 0 such that q s (q −δs XF −∆) ≤
M for s = 1, 2, . . . . As it is known, this implies that among the irreducible
components of X there are exactly ∆ of maximum dimension, and that maximum
dimension is δ. By 1.3, any G-orbit on X has dimension δ. It follows that X
has exactly ∆ G-orbits. Since X is naturally in bijection with the set of all ψ ∈
Hom(A5 , G) that give rise to (C2 , C3 , C5 ) we see that the theorem is proved.

                 5. Relation to homomorphisms P GL2 (k) −
                                                        → G
5.1. In this section we assume that either p = 0 or p is large enough. Let G be as
in 1.2. Let Φ : P GL2 (k) − → G be a homomorphism. Composing Φ with one of the
two regular homomorphisms A5 −      → P GL2 (k) (up to P GL2 (k)-conjugacy, see 1.8),
we obtain two homomorphisms A5 −       → G (which may or may not be G-conjugate).
    In [S], it is pointed out that by applying this construction to a Φ whose image
contains a regular unipotent element in G (of type Em ) we obtain a regular ψ.
Applying the same procedure for G = Gad of type Am−1 , we see that all regular
ψ in 1.8 can be thus obtained for m = 2, 3, 5, 6 but only one of the two regular ψ
is thus obtained for m = 4. This procedure can be applied for G as in 1.9. In that
case, for m = 4, the first two ψ in 1.9(a) are obtained; for m = 5, the first ψ in
22                                       G. LUSZTIG

1.9(b) is obtained; for m = 6, the first ψ in 1.9(c) is obtained; for m = 8, the first
ψ in 1.9(d) is obtained.
    Let us analyze what happens if we use some other Φ.
    Let G be as in 1.9 and assume that Φ is such that its image contains a subregular
unipotent element of G. For m = 4, we thus obtain the third and fourth ψ in 1.9(a);
for m = 5, we thus obtain the second ψ in 1.9(b); for m = 6, we thus obtain the
second and third ψ in 1.9(c).
    Let G be as in 1.9(d). If Φ is such that its image contains a unipotent element
whose Jordan blocks in the standard representation have sizes 1, 3, 5, 7, then the
associated ψ is regular.
    If G (as in 1.10) is of type E8 and Φ is such that the centralizer of its image
is the symmetric group in 5 letters, then the ψ obtained from Φ by the procedure
above is again regular (the corresponding 235 -triple is the one described in 1.10).
Using 4.5, the ψ thus obtained must be the same up to conjugacy as the one
attached to a regular unipotent class.
    These arguments together with 4.5 show that, if G = Gad is simple, then any
ψ ∈ Homreg (A5 , G) is obtained from some Φ : P GL2 (k) −   → G, except for one case
in type A3 .
