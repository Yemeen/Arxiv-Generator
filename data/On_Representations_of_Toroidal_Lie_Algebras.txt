                                             0 § Introduction:
                                                I gave two talks on some of my results on toroidal Lie algebras in the
                                             conference Functional Analysis VIII held in Dubrovnik, Croatia in June
                                             2003. But these results have been submitted to research journals and will
                                             appear soon. So I decided to write an expository article on Toroidal Lie
                                             Algebras covering my results for the proceedings of Functional Analysis VIII.
                                                I will introduce the definitions of toroidal Lie algebras and also the gen-
                                             eralized Virasoro algebra in the introduction below. In the main body of the
                                             article I will state most of the recent results on representations of toroidal
                                             Lie algebras with finite dimensional weight spaces.
                                                Toroidal Lie algebras are n-variable generalizations of the well known
                                             affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras. The affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra, which
                                             is the universal central extension of Loop algebra, has a very rich theory of
                                             highest weight modules and some of their characters admit modular proper-
                                             ties. The level one highest weight integrable modules has been constructed
                                             explicitly on the Fock space through the use of vertex operators (see [FK];


                                                                                   1
for an introduction to vertex operator algebras, see [LL]). In such cases the
characters can be computed easily and using Weyl - Kac character formula
interesting identities have been obtained.
   There is another well known Lie algebra called Virasoro Lie algebra which
is the universal central extension of the Lie algebra of diffeomorphisms of one
dimensional torus. The Virasoro Lie algebra acts on any (except when the
level is negative of dual coxeter number) highest weight module of the affine
Lie algebra through the use of famous Sugawara operators. So the semi-
direct product of affine Lie algebra and Virasoro Lie algebra with common
center has turned out to be a very important Lie algebra in mathematics and
also in physics. This Lie algebra plays a very significant role in Conformal
Field Theory. The connection to physics is explained in great detail by Di
Francesco, Mathieu and Senechal in the book on Conformal Field Theory
[DMS].
   Toroidal Lie algebras are born out of an attempt to generalize the above
classical theory. We will first define toroidal Lie algebra and explain the main
results obtained.
   Let G be a simple finite dimensional Lie algebra and let A = C[t±1           ±1
                                                                   1 , · · · , tn ]
be a Laurent polynomial ring in n commutating variables. Then G ⊗ A has a
natural structure of Lie algebra and the universal central extension is what
we call Toroidal Lie algebra. For the first time a large class of representations
are constructed in [EMY] and [EM] through the use of vertex operators on
the Fock space. Thus giving a realization of toroidal Lie algebras.
   Affine Lie algebras are precisely the case when n = 1. One significant dif-
ference for toroidal Lie algebra is that the universal center for n ≥ 2 is infinite
dimensional where as it is one dimensional for affine Lie algebras. Toroidal
Lie algebras are naturally Zn -graded and there is no natural decomposition
into positive and negative spaces. Thus the standard highest weight module
theory does not apply for toroidal case. Also the infinite center does not act


                                        2
as scalars on irreducible module but as invertible operators. So the study of
modules does not follow the standard methods of affine modules and needs
completely different techniques.
   Surprisingly, a lot of information can be obtained on an irreducible mod-
ule for toroidal Lie algebra when we assume all weight spaces are finite di-
mensional. For example the part of the center which acts non-trivially on an
irreducible module will have a definite shape. In the sense that if we mod
out some arbitrary part of the center and look for an irreducible module with
finite dimensional weight spaces, they may not exist. For example if we mod
out all the non-zero degree center then module does not exist with finite
dimensional weight spaces and with non-zero central (zero degree) action.
Further it is proved that the ratio of standard zero degree central operators
on an irreducible module with finite dimensional weight spaces is rational.
See ref. [E8].
   The most striking result is the classification of irreducible integrable mod-
ules for toroidal Lie algebras with finite dimensional weight spaces. But the
classification is disappointing as the modules are tensor product of evaluation
modules of affine Lie algebras. In particular the characters are product of
affine characters. See references [E4,E5 and Y].
   It is worth noting that integrable modules are not completely reducible
and such modules are constructed by Chari and Le Thang [CL]. So the clas-
sification of integrable modules not necessarily irreducible may be interesting
and their characters being Weyl group invariant may hold some significance.
   The next natural issue is to generalize the Virasoro Lie algebra. Thus we
consider the Lie algebra of diffeomorphisms on n dimensional torus which
is known to be isomorphic to DerA the derivation algebra of A. Several
attempts have been made by physicists to give a Fock space representation to
DerA or to its extension (see [FR]). They all failed to produce any interesting
results due to lack of proper definitions of “normal ordering” among other


                                       3
things. At this juncture an interesting result has come out in [RSS] which
says that DerA has no non-trivial central extension.
    Let us go back to the Vertex construction of toroidal Lie algebra in [EM]
where operators are defined for DerA on the Fock space generalizing the
Sugawara construction. But the corresponding extension for DerA turned
out to be very wild (certainly non-central) and not tractable [E7]. In the
process an interesting abelian extension for DerA has been created in [EM]
and the abelian part is exactly the center of the toroidal Lie algebra. So the
semi-direct sum of toroidal Lie algebra and the DerA with common extension
has emerged as an interesting object of study which we will now define.
    First we define a toroidal Lie algebra see [MY] and [Ka]. Let G be a
simple finite dimensional Lie algebra over complex numbers. Let <, > be
a G-invariant symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form on G. Fix a positive
integer n and recall A = C[t±1           ±1
                            1 , · · · , tn ]. Let ΩA be the module of differentials
which can be defined as vector space spanned by the symbols {tr Ki , r ∈
                                                            P r
Zn , 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Let dA be the subspace spanned by             ri t Ki and consider
                       P r
ΩA /dA . Let K(u, r) =   ui t Ki , u = (u1 , · · · , un ) ∈ Cn . Then the toroidal
Lie algebra is τ = G ⊗ A ⊕ ΩA /dA with Lie bracket

 (1) [X ⊗ tr , Y ⊗ ts ] = [X, Y ] ⊗ tr+s + < X, Y > K(r, r + s).

 (2) K(u, r) is central.
      Here X ∈ G and tr = tr11 · · · trnn ∈ A.

    DerA has {tr ti dtdi , r ∈ Zn , 1 ≤ i ≤ n} for a basis. Write D(u, r) =
P
                                               \ of DerA is as follows [EM].
    uitr ti d , u ∈ Cn . The abelian extension DerA
         dti

                            \ = ΩA /dA ⊕ DerA.
                            DerA

The Lie bracket is given by,

 (3) [D(u, r), D(v, s)] = D(w, r + s) − (u, s)(v, r)K(r, r + s),
      where w = (u, s)v − (v, r)u

                                         4
 (4) [D(u, r), K(v, s)] = (u, s)K(v, r + s) + (u, v)K(r, r + s)

 (5) [K(u, r), K(v, s)] = 0
where (, ) is the standard bilinear form on Cn . We will now define the semi-
direct product of toroidal Lie algebra and DerA with common extension
which we call full toroidal Lie algebra.

                           τb = G ⊗ A ⊕ ΩA /dA ⊕ DerA

 (6) [D(u, r), X ⊗ ts ] = (u, s)X ⊗ tr+s
     (1) to (6) defines the Lie structure on τb.
The first natural question is, does there exists a realization for τb, in other
words can we construct a natural module for τb. Several attempts have been
made in [EM], [BB] and [BBS]. Eventually Yuly Billig in [B3] has succeeded
in constructing a module through the use of Vertex operator algebras. The
irreducible integrable modules for τb with finite dimensional weight spaces has
been classified recently see references [JM2] and [EJ].

§ 1. Representation of Toroidal Lie algebras

(1.1) Let G be simple finite dimensional Lie algebra over complex numbers.
For any positive integer n, let A = An = C[t±1           ±1
                                            1 , · · · , tn ] be Laurent polyno-
mial ring in n commuting variables. The universal central extension of G ⊗ A
is called toroidal Lie algebra τ . τ can be constructed more explicitly.
   For r = (r1 , · · · , rn ) ∈ Zn let tr = tr11 tr22 · · · trnn ∈ A. Let ΩA be the vector
space spanned by the symbols {tr Ki , r ∈ Zn , 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Let dA be the
                     P
subspace spanned by { ri tr Ki , r ∈ Zn }.
   Let τ = G ⊗ A ⊕ ΩA /dA and the Lie structure is given by
 (1) [X ⊗tr , Y ⊗ts ] = [X, Y ]⊗tr+s + < X, Y > d(tr )ts where X, Y ∈ G, r, s ∈
     Zn and <, > is a G-invariant symmetric bilinear form on G. Further
               P
     d(tr )ts = ri tr+s Ki .

                                           5
  (2) ΩA /dA is central in τ .

Theorem ([MY], [Ka]) τ is the universal central extension of G ⊗ A.
    Clearly τ is naturally graded by Zn . To reflect this fact let D be the
linear span of degree derivations d1 , · · · , dn definite as

                                 [di , X ⊗ tr ] = ri X ⊗ tr

                                   [di , tr Kj ] = ri tr Kj

                                        [di , dj ] = 0

Let τ̃ = τ ⊕ D and is also called a toroidal Lie algebra. It is easy to see that

                            dim(ΩA /dA )r = n − 1 if r 6= 0.

                                   dim(ΩA /dA )0 = n.

Thus dimension of ΩA /dA is infinite if n ≥ 2 and equals to one if n = 1. In
fact from the definition it follows that τ̃ is affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra for
n = 1.
    Thus toroidal Lie algebras are n variable generalization of affine Kac-
Moody Lie algebras.

(1.2) Root space decomposition for τ̃ [E5]. Fix a Cartan subalgebra h of
G . Let △ be the root system of G and let α1 , · · · αd be set of simple roots.
                                                 L
Let α1∨ , · · · , αd∨ be simple co-roots. Let G = α∈△ Gα ⊕ h be the root space
decomposition of G. We will now describe the root space decomposition of
                                       P
τ̃ with respect to the Cartan h̃ = h ⊕   CKi ⊕ D. Let δ1 , δ2 , · · · δn be in
h̃∗ such that δi (dj ) = δij , δi (αj∨) = 0 and δi (Kj ) = 0. Let Λ1 , · · · Λn be in
h̃∗ such that Λi (αj∨ ) = 0, Λi (dj ) = 0 and Λi (Kj ) = δij . Then it is clear that
α1 , · · · αd , δ1 , · · · δn , Λ1 , · · · , Λn is a basis of h̃∗ for dimension reasons. It is
now easy to give a non-degenerate (non-positive definite) symmetric bilinear

                                              6
form on h̃∗ such that the corresponding matrix with respect to the basis
α1 , · · · , αd , δ1 , · · · δn , Λ1 , · · · , Λn is
                                                           
                                                  AD, 0, 0
                                                           
                                                  0, 0, I 
                                                           
                                                    0, I, 0

    Here A is the finite Cartan matrix and D is diagonal so that AD is
symmetric.
                        P
    For r ∈ Zn let δr =   ri δi and note that (δr , δs ) = 0. The δr ’s are called
                ˜ = {α + δr , δs | α ∈ △, r, s ∈ Zn }. Then τ̃ has the following
null roots. Let △
root space decomposition
        M
   τ̃ =     τ̃γ where
            ˜
          γ∈△
if γ = α + δr , α ∈ △ then τ̃γ = Gα ⊗ tr if γ = δr 6= 0 then τ̃r = h ⊗ tr
if γ = 0 then τ̃0 = h̃.
    Let αd+j = β − δj , 1 ≤ j ≤ n which should be thought of as additional
simple roots. It is easy to see that every root is linear combinations of
α1 , · · · , αd+n but not non-negative or non-positive linear combinations of α’s.
Thus there is no natural positive or negative root spaces. So the standard
highest weight module theory does not go through for toroidal Lie algebra.
    If we compute the matrix (αi , αj )1≤i,j≤d+n one see that it is a general-
ized intersection matrix (GIM). Thus toroidal Lie algebras are quotients of
GIM algebras as defined by Slodowy. In fact they are GIM algebras in the
symmetric case and it is open problem in the non-symmetric case.
    We will now describe some of the known results on toroidal Lie alge-
bras. The first is the shape of the possible non-zero center on an arbitrary
irreducible module. The second one is the classification of irreducible inte-
grable modules. The third one is the sketch of the construction of faithful
representation for toroidal Lie algebra through the use of vertex operators.



                                                  7
(1.3) Shape of the non-zero center of an irreducible representation [E8].
We fix an irreducible representation V for the toroidal Lie algebra with finite
dimensional weight spaces. An operator z : V → V is called central operator
of degree m ∈ Zn if z commutes with τ action and diz − zdi = mi z. For
example tm Ki is a central operator of degree m and tn Ki tm Kj is a central
operator of degree m + n.

Lemma (a) Suppose a central operator is non-zero at one vector then it
is non-zero at every vector.
(b) A non-zero central operator of degree m admits an inverse which is a
central operator of degree −m.
(c) Suppose z1 and z2 are non-zero central operators of degree m then z1 =
λz2 for some non-zero scalar λ.
   Let L = {r ∈ Zn | tr Ki is non-zero on V for some i}. Let S be the group
generated by L. We first note that for m ∈ S there is a non-zero central
operator of degree m.
   Let rank of S = k.
Before we explain our results we will first explain the notion of change of
co-ordinates.

Choice of co-ordinates: Let B ∈ GL(n, Z) and let e1 , · · · en be the stan-
dard basis of Zn .
   Let si = tB(ei ) . Then the subalgebra generated by s±1            ±1         ±1
                                                        i which is C[s1 , · · · sn ]
and is equal to C[t±1         ±1
                   1 , · · · tn ] as B is invertible. This way we can choose dif-

ferent co-ordinates which give the same Laurent polynomial ring.

Automorphism Any B ∈ GL(n, Z) defines an automorphism of τ̃ by

                               BX ⊗ tr = X ⊗ tBr

                               Bd(tr )ts = d(tBr )tBs

                                         8
                                                        B
Suppose V is a module for τ̃ then consider τ̃ → τ̃ → EndV . By twisting
by an automorphism we get a new module. This is equivalent to change of
co-ordinates.

Theorem Suppose ΩA /dA acts as non-zero on V . Then the following holds
for a suitable choice of co-ordinates.
 (1) k = n − 1

 (2) If tr Ki 6= 0 on V then i = n and rn = 0 where r = (r1 , · · · rn ) ∈ Zn .

 (3) There exists non-zero central operators z1 , · · · zn−1 of degree (k1 , 0, · · · 0),
      · · · , (0, · · · 0, kn−1, 0) where each ki is positive integer.

 (4) There exists a proper submodule W of V for the Lie algebra τ ⊕ Cdn
      such that V /W has finite dimensional weight space for the Cartan
          P
      h ⊕ CKi ⊕ Cdn . Further tr Kn acts as scalar on V /W .

Corollary Let n ≥ 2. Let τ be the quotient of τ̃ by non-zero degree central
operators. Then τ does not admit representation with finite dimensional
weight spaces where the center (degree zero) act non-trivially.

Proof Here k = 0. Thus by the above theorem ΩA /dA acts trivially. In
particular each Ki acts trivially.
   Let Gaf f = G ⊗ C[tn , t−1
                           n ] ⊕ CKn consider the Lie algebra homomorphism


            ϕ : τ̃    7→ Gaf f ⊗ An−1 ⊕ D

From above theorem we see that on any irreducible integrable module for
toroidal Lie algebra, the Ker ϕ acts trivially upto the choice of co-ordinates.
     Note that the quotient V /W that occurs in the statement (4) of the the-
orem need not be irreducible nevertheless it admits an irreducible quotient.
It is proved in [E8] that from this irreducible quotient it is possible to recover
the original module V . Thus we have the following

Remark The study of irreducible modules with finite dimensional weight
spaces for toroidal Lie algebra τ̃ is reduced to the study of irreducible modules
for Gaf f ⊗An−1 ⊕Cdn with finite dimensional weight spaces where the infinite
center Kn ⊗ An−1 acts as scalars.

1.4 Classification of irreducible integrable modules with finite dimensional
weight spaces [E4], [E5] and [Y].

Definition A weight module V of τ̃ is said to be integrable if for every v
in V and α ∈ △, m ∈ Zn there exists k = k(α, m, v) such that

                                  (Xα ⊗ tm )k v = 0.

We will now describe the classification of irreducible integrable modules for
the Toroidal Lie algebra.
     For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let Ni be a positive integer. Let ai = (ai1 , · · · aiNi )
be non-zero distinct complex numbers. Let N = N1 N2 · · · Nn . Let I =

ij ≤ Nj } and clearly #S = N. Let I1 , · · · IN be some order of elements in S.
For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ N let λi be a dominant integral weight for the affine Lie
algebra Gaf f . Let V (λi ) be the irreducible integrable highest weight module


                                          10
for Gaf f . We will now define a Gaf f ⊗ A ⊕ Cdn module structure on

                          V (λ1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ V (λN ) ⊗ A by

                              X ⊗ tr (v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vN ⊗ ts )

The following hold for the above module. Let h′ = h0 ⊕                  CKi ⊕ Cdi .

 (1) Integrable

 (2) Finite dimensional weight spaces with respect to h′ .

 (3) Completely reducible and most often irreducible. All components are
     isomorphic upto grade shift.

Theorem Any irreducible integrable module for the toroidal Lie algebra
with finite dimensional weight spaces where center acts non-trivially is iso-
morphic to a component of the above module up to a choice of co-ordinates.

Remark The classification for the case where the center zero is similar.
The Gaf f has to be replaced by the finite dimension simple Lie algebra G and
V (λi ) is irreducible integrable module for G. The case center acts trivially
has also been done by Youngsun Yoon [Y]. She is able to give necessary and
sufficient condition for the above module to be irreducible.



                                            11
Remark It is well known that affine Kac-Moody Lie-algebras has a rich
representation theory like highest weight integrable modules where Weyl
character formula holds. But the corresponding theory for toroidal Lie alge-
bras is very disappointing as the integrable modules are made out of affine
modules. It could still be possible that semi integrable modules for toroidal
Lie algebras could be of interest as in the case of affine Lie algebras [W]. It
should be mentioned that integrable modules for toroidal Lie algebras need
not be completely reducible (even with the assumption that each weight
space is finite dimensional). Such modules are constructed by Chari and Le
Thang [CL] in two variables case. So the classification of integrable modules
not necessarily irreducible is an interesting problem as their characters are
W -invariant and may hold modular properties. There are also constructions
of non-integrable modules for toroidal Lie algebras by Ben Cox [C] and Jing,
Misra and Tan [JMT] which may lead to Wakimoto type modules for toroidal
Lie algebra.

1.5 Representations for toroidal Lie algebras through the use of Vertex
operators [EMY] and [EM].
    Let Γ be a non-degenerate integral lattice with symmetric bilinear form
(,). Let h = C ⊗Z Γ. Extend the form to h bilinear. For each n let h(n) be
a vector space isomorphic to h through the isomorphism a → a(n), a ∈ h.
We create the Heisenberg Lie algebra

                            A = ⊕n∈Z h(n) ⊕ CC

with Lie structure [a(n), b(m)] = δm+n,0 n(a, b)C and C is central. Let A± =
⊕   >   h(n) so that
 n<0
                        A = A+ ⊕ h(0) ⊕ CC ⊕ A− .
Let C[Γ] be the group algebra and form the Fock space

                            V (Γ) = C[Γ] ⊗ S(A− )

                                      12
where S(A− ) is the symmetric algebra of A− , V (Γ) admits a natural Heisen-
berg Lie algebra structure. Let Q be even integral sub lattice.
    For α ∈ Q let
                               (α,α)
               X(α, z) = z       2      exp T− (α, z)eα z α(0) exp T+ (α, z)
                   X 1
where T± (α, z) = −     α(n)z −n
                    >
                      n
                       n<0

                              z α(0) · eµ ⊗ u = z (α,µ) eµ ⊗ u

                                   eα · eµ ⊗ u = eα+µ ⊗ u.
                                                                                      X
There are all operators on V [Γ] ⊗ C[z, z −1 ]. Write X(α, z) =                        Xn (α)z −n .
                                                                                      n∈Z
Then each component Xn (α) is an infinite sum but Xn (α)v is finite for any
v in V [Γ].
    We now choose simple finite dimensional Lie algebra G whose dynkin dia-
gram is simply laced. Now let Γ be the lattice spanned by α1 , · · · αd , δ1 , · · · δn ,
Λ1 , · · · Λn and Q be the lattice spanned by α1 , · · · αd , δ1 , · · · δn . We will now
give a faithful and integrable representation for the toroidal Lie algebra in
n + 1 variables.

Theorem The following map defines a faithful representation for the toroidal
Lie algebra.

                                    k∈Z


Remark       1 The representation is highly reducible. It is proved in [E2]
that there is a filtration such that successive quotients are loop modules.

Remark      2. The above construction of the representation has been gen-
eralized to non-simply laced case by [JM1], [JY], [T2] and [XH].
   Using this representation we can give a very nice presentation for the
toroidal Lie algebra in two variables which has been used to construct mod-
ules in [C] and [JMT].

Theorem [EMY] The following generators with the relations is a presen-
tation for the toroidal Lie algebra in two variables.

the bilinear form given by the affine matrix A. (αi , αj∨) is the evaluation of

§2        A generalization of Virasoro algebra

2.1 It is well known that the derivation algebra of A = C[t±1         ±1
                                                           1 , · · · tn ], de-
noted by DerA, is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of diffeomorphisms of n
dimensional torus. The universal central extension of DerA for n = 1 is the
well known Virasoro algebra. The representations of Virasoro algebra is stud-
ied in great detail. See Ref.[KR]. It is interesting to note that DerA, n ≥ 2
is centrally closed in the sense that it does not admit non-trivial central ex-
tension. See Ref.[RSS]. But it admits an abelian extension (see [EM]) which
generalizes the Virasoro algebra.
      In this section we recall the construction of DerA modules due to Larsson
[L3] and state its properties. Later we construct modules for the abelian
extension and state a conjecture on the classification of its modules.

(2.2) Let Cn be the n copies of the complex field C. Let e1 , · · · en be
the standard basis of Cn and let (, ) be the standard form on Cn such that
(ei , ej ) = δij . Let Zn = Ze1 ⊕ Ze2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Zen . For r ∈ Zn let D i (r) = tr ti dtdi .
It is easy to verify that D i (r), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, r ∈ Zn is basis of DerA. For u ∈ Cn
let
                                            X
                                D(u, r) =        uiD i (r).

The Lie structure on DerA is given by

                          [D(u, r), D(v, s)] = D(w, r + s)

where w = (u, s)v − (v, r)u.

                                            15
   Let gℓn be the Lie algebra of n × n matrices with entries in C. Let Eij
be the elementary matrix with (i, j)th entry to be 1 and zero elsewhere. It
is well known that gℓn is spanned by Eij with Lie bracket

                         [Eij , Ekℓ ] = δjk Eiℓ − δiℓ Ekj .

Let gℓn = sℓn ⊕ CI where sℓn is the subalgebra of trace zero matrices and I
is the identity matrix. Let V (ψ) be the irreducible finite dimensional module
for sℓn and let I act by a scalar b. Denote the resultant gℓn module by
V (ψ, b). For α ∈ Cn we will make F α (ψ, b) = V (ψ, b) ⊗ A a DerA module.
First denote v ⊗ tm by v(m) for v in V (ψ, b) and m ∈ Zn . The following
definition is due to Larsson [L3].
                                             X
         D(u, r)v(m) = (u, m + α)v(m + r) + (  uirj Ejiv)(m + r)

where m, r ∈ Zn , u ∈ Cn and v ∈ V (ψ, b).

Theorem [E3]
 (1) F α (ψ, b) is irreducible DerA module if (ψ, b) 6= (δk , k), (0, b) where δk
     is the fundamental weight for sℓn , 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.

 (2) F α (0, b) is irreducible as DerA module unless α ∈ Zn and b ∈ {0, n}.

 (3) In all other cases F α (ψ, b) is reducible and the submodule structure has
     been worked out in [E3].
   The above result has been generalized by Weiqiang Lin and Shaobin Tan
in [LT] for non-commuting variables, the so called quantum torus.
   Let us note that F α (ψ, b) is A module by defining

                             tr v(m) = v(m + r).

   Then it is not difficult to see that F α (ψ, b) is always irreducible as
A ⋉ DerA module and the semi direct product is given by

                   [D(u, r), tm] = (u, m)tr+m , [tr , ts ] = 0.

                                        16
Theorem [E6] Any irreducible A ⋉ DerA module with finite dimensional
weight spaces has to be F α (ψ, b) for some ψ dominant integral and some
scalar b and for some α.

(2.2) We will now define an abelian extension for DerA denoted by

                              \ = ΩA /dA ⊕ DerA
                              DerA

Definition An abelian extension we mean an extension of DerA whose
kernal is an abelian ideal.
                                 \ is given in [EM]. Denote K(u, r) =

r0 < 0 and r0 = 0). Then clearly we have the following decomposition of
subalgebras

   Then J(ψ, b) has a unique irreducible quotient (we assume either C 6= 0
on d 6= 0) say I(ψ, b). Now from Berman and Billig [BB] it follows that
I(ψ, b) has finite dimensional graded spaces as Zn+1 graded vector space.

Conjecture Any irreducible module for DerA
spaces has to come from Larsson’s construction or a highest weight module
in the above sense upto suitable choice of co-ordinates.

§ 3 Full Toroidal Lie algebra In this section we define a more general
toroidal Lie algebra which we call full toroidal Lie algebra and denoted by

                       τb = G ⊗ A ⊕ ΩA /dA ⊕ DerA.

The Lie structure for the first two components and for the last two component
has already been defined. Thus we defined Lie bracket between the first and
the third component.

                     [D(u, r), X ⊗ ts ] = (u, s)X ⊗ tr+s .

                                        18
We will now state the results on classification of integrable modules for τb.
As earlier a module for τb is integrable if it is integrable as τ module. That is
Xα ⊗ tr acts as locally nilpotent on the module. We will work with (n + 1)
variables and the (n + 1)th variable is chosen as t0 .
   Let us note that the span of {K0 , K1 , · · · , Kn } is the center of τb and
on an irreducible integrable weight module each Ki acts as integer. We
will first construct irreducible integrable modules for τb with finite dimen-
sional weight spaces where K0 acts as positive integer and Ki (1 ≤ i ≤ n)
acts trivially. Clearly τb is Zn+1 graded and we will extract one Z- gra-
dation that is by t0 .    Let τb+ (respectively τb− , τb0 ) be the linear span of
G ⊗ tr00 tr , D(u, (r0, r)), K(u, (r0, r)) where r0 > 0 (respectively r0 < 0 and
r0 = 0}.
   Then τb = τb− ⊕ τb0 ⊕ τb+ .
   We will first define τb0 module and then make τb+ acts trivially and then we
consider the standard induced highest weight module. Let An = C[t±1         ±1
                                                                 1 , · · · tn ]
and recall that F α (ψ, b) = V (ψ, b) ⊗ An is a DerAn -module. Let W be finite
dimensional irreducible module for the finite dimensional Lie algebra G. We
fix a positive integer C0 and a complex number d.
   Consider T = W ⊗ F α (ψ, b) which will now be made into τb0 -module.
   Let w ∈ W, v ∈ V (ψ, b) and r, s ∈ Zn .
X ⊗ tr · w ⊗ v ⊗ ts = Xw ⊗ v ⊗ tr+s , X ∈ G
D(u, r)w ⊗ v ⊗ ts = w ⊗ D(u, r)(v ⊗ ts ), u ∈ Cn ,

                     D(e0 , r)w ⊗ v ⊗ ts = d(w ⊗ v ⊗ tr+s )

                       K(u, r)w ⊗ v ⊗ ts = 0 for u ∈ Cn

                    K(e0 , r)w ⊗ v ⊗ ts = C0 (w ⊗ v ⊗ ts+r ).

   Recall K(u, r) and D(u, r) are linear in u. We first defined K(u, r) and
D(u, r) for the last n variable and then separately for K(e0 , r) and D(e0 , r).


                                       19
It is easy to check that T is a module for τb0 and in fact it is irreducible. Let
τb+ act trivially and consider the induced τb-module

                              M(T ) = U(b
                                        τ ) ⊗τb+ ⊕bτ0 T.

    It is easy to see that M(T ) has a unique irreducible quotient say V (T ).
V (T ) has a natural Zn+1 -gradation and it follows from Berman and Billig
[BB] that each weight space is finite dimensional. From the fact that W
is finite dimensional it follows that V (T ) is integrable but that is little non
trivial.

Theorem ([JM2], [EJ]). Suppose V ′ is irreducible integrable module for τb
with finite dimensional weight spaces. Suppose the center acts non-trivially.
Then V ′ is isomorphic to V (T ) for some T up to a suitable choice of co-
ordinates.
    The proof consists of three steps. The first step is to prove that V ′ is
a highest weight module upto suitable choice of co-ordinates, which follows
from [E5]. The second step is to reduce the classification of irreducible inte-
grable highest weight module for the classification of An ⋉ DerAn irreducible
modules whose proof can be found in [JM2]. The third step is to classify
A ⋉ DerA modules which is done in [E6].
    We will now describe the irreducible integrable modules for τb where the
center acts trivially.
    We will work with n variables. Let W be any non-trivial finite dimensional
irreducible module for G. Then we make W ⊗ V (ψ, b) ⊗ A as τb-module.

                         X ⊗ tr · u ⊗ v ⊗ ts = Xu ⊗ v ⊗ tr+s

                    D(u, r)u ⊗ v ⊗ ts = u ⊗ D(u, r)(v ⊗ ts )

                               K(u, r)u ⊗ v ⊗ ts = 0.


                                         20
   It is easy to see that W ⊗ V (ψ, b) ⊗ A is an irreducible integrable module
for τb with finite dimensional weight spaces. Note that W has to be non-trivial
for the module to be irreducible.

Theorem ([JM2], [EJ])        Suppose V ′ is an irreducible integrable module
for τb with finite dimensional weight space. Suppose the center acts trivially
and suppose G action on V ′ is non-trivial. Then V ′ ∼
                                                     = W ⊗ V (ψ, b) ⊗ A for
some W non-trivial module for G and for some ψ and b.

Remark The assumption that G acts non-trivially is necessary in the the-
orem.
   The case where G acts trivially is open. In this case the problem is nothing
but the conjecture stated in section 2.
   It is an open problem for a long time to explicitly construct a module
for τb. Several attempts have been made in ([EM], [E7], [BB], [BBS]) to find
a realization for τb. Eventually in a remarkable paper [B3], Yuly Billig suc-
ceeded in construction of a module for τ̃ through the use of Vertex Operator
Algebras.

Remark Consider D ∗ = {D(u, r) ∈ DerA | (u, r) = 0}. Then G ⊗ A ⊕
ΩA /dA ⊕ D ∗ is a subalgebra of τb and form an important class of examples of
the so called Extended Affine Lie Algebra (EALA).

Definition of EALA Let L be a Lie algebra over C. Assume that
(EA1) L has a nondegenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form (,)
(EA2) L has a nontrivial finite dimensional self-centralising ad-diagonalisable
abelian subalgebra H.
   We will assume 3 further axioms about the triple (L, (·, ·), H). To describe
these axioms we need further notation. Using (EA2), we have


                                      21
                                         M
                                  L=           Lα ,
                                         α∈H

and
                                     L0 = H.

where Lα = {x ∈ L : [h, x] = α(h)x for all h ∈ H}, and H ∗ is the complex
dual space of H. Let

                           R = {α ∈ H ∗ : Lα 6= {0}}.

R is called the root system of L. Note that since H 6= {0} we have 0 ∈ R.
Also,
                    α, β ∈ R, α + β 6= 0 ⇒ (Lα , Lβ ) = {0}              1.1

Thus, −R = R. Moreover, (·, ·) is nondegenerate on H. So as usual we can
transfer (·, ·) to a form on H ∗ . Let

         R∗ = {α ∈ R : (α, α) 6= 0} and R0 = {α ∈ R : (α, α) = 0}.

The elements of R∗ (respectively R0 ) are called non isotropic (respectively
isotropic ) roots. We have
                                  R = R0 ∪ R∗ .

(EA3) α ∈ R∗ , xα ∈ Lα ⇒ adxα acts locally nil-potently on L.
(EA4) R is a discrete subset of H ∗ .
(EA5) R is irreducible. That is
   (a) R∗ = R1 ∪ R2 , (R1 , R2 ) = {0} ⇒ R1 = 0 or R2 = 0


   (b) σ ∈ R0 ⇒. There exists α ∈ R∗ such that α + σ ∈ R.
   Then L is called EALA.
   Extensive research has been done on the structure and classification of
EALA’s. See [AABGP] and [AG] and the references there in.

Open Problems. Certainty toroidal Lie algebras form an important class
of examples of Extended Affine Lie Algebras (EALA) and certain progress
has been made towards representation theory of toroidal Lie algebras. One
question is that can we develop similar theory for EALA. In particular is it
possible to classify irreducible integrable modules for EALA’s.
   Apart from toroidal Lie algebras, one particular example of EALA for
which representations are studied is an EALA whose co-ordinated algebra is
a quantum torus and they generally appear in type A. The representations
of this Lie algebra is studied by Yun Gao, Kei Miki and myself. It will be
good idea to classify irreducible integrable modules for this Lie algebra.
   The classification of integrable modules for the toroidal super-algebra has
been attempted in [EZ]. Several open problems exists in super case.
   More complex algebras, the so called quantum toroidal is also pursued by
several authors like E. Vasserot, M. Varagnolo, Kei Miki, Naihuan Jing and
Oliver Schiffmann.

Applications. The vertex representation for toroidal Lie algebras for the
homogeneous picture is done in [EM]. Similar construction is made for the
principal picture in [B1]. Both constructions have found applications in dif-
ferential equations via [B2], [ISW] and [IT].
   The papers [EM] and [EMY] have been mentioned in physics literature
from the works of T.A. Larsson, M. Calixto,, T. Iami, T.Ueno and H. Kanno.
In fact Larsson has reinterpreted the results of [EM] and [EMY] in the lan-
guage of Physics in [L4] and [L5].
