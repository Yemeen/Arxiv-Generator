                                                     Abstract. The centralizer algebra of the action of U (n) on the real
                                                     tensor powers ⊗rR V of its natural module, V = Cn , is described by means
                                                     of a modification in the multiplication of the signed Brauer algebras.
                                                     The relationships of this algebra with the invariants for U (n) and with
                                                     the decomposition of ⊗rR V into irreducible submodules is considered.

                                                The motivation for this work comes from a paper by Gray and Hervella [7]:
                                             Let (M, g, J) be an almost Hermitian manifold; that is, M is a Riemannian
                                             manifold with Riemannian metrig g, and endowed with an almost complex
                                             structure J. Let ∇ be the Riemannian connection and F the Kähler form:
                                             F (X, Y ) = g(JX, Y ) for any X, Y ∈ χ(M ) (the set of smooth vector fields).
                                             The tensor G = ∇F satisfies G(X, Y, Z) = −G(X, Z, Y ) = −G(X, JY, JZ)
                                             for any X, Y, Z ∈ χ(M ). Therefore, at any point p ∈ M , α = Gp belongs to

                                               Wp = {α ∈ Mp∗ ⊗R Mp∗ ⊗R Mp∗ :
                                                            α(x, y, z) = −α(x, z, y) = −α(x, Jy, Jz) ∀x, y, z ∈ Mp }, (1.1)
                                             where Mp denotes the tangent space at p and Mp∗ its dual (the cotangent
                                             space), and Mp∗ ⊗R Mp∗ ⊗R Mp∗ is identified naturally with the space of trilinear
                                             forms on Mp .
                                                The classification of almost hermitian manifolds in [7] is based on the
                                             decomposition of Wp into irreducible modules under the action of the unitary
                                             group U (n), and this is done by first providing four specific subspaces of Wp
                                             (if the dimension of M is not very small) and then showing that they are
                                             irreducible (by means of invariants) and Wp is their direct sum. No clue
                                             is given about how these four subspaces are obtained. A different way to
                                             obtain this decomposition is given in [5] based on complexification of Wp
                                             and the use of Young symmetrizers.
                                                The situation above extends naturally to the following problem:
                                                Given a complex vector space V of dimension n, endowed with a nonde-
                                             generate hermitian form h : V × V → C, decompose the nth tensor power
                                             ⊗rR V (over the real numbers!) into a direct sum of irreducible modules for
                                             the unitary group U (V, h) = {g ∈ GLC (V ) : h(gv, gw) = h(v, w) ∀v, w ∈ V }.

   Here, the convention is that h(αv, w) = αh(v, w) and h(v, w) = h(w, v)
for any α ∈ C, v, w ∈ V .
   The well-known Schur-Weyl duality [16, 17, 20] relates the representation
theory of the general linear group GLC (V ) with that of the symmetric group
Sr via the naturally centralizing actions of the two groups on the space ⊗rC V :
GLC (V ) → ⊗rC V ← Sr . Brauer [4] considered the analogous situation for
the orthogonal and symplectic groups, where Sr has to be replaced by what
are now called the Brauer algebras: O(V ) → ⊗rC V ← Brr (n) and Sp(V ) →
⊗rC V ← Brr (−n). More recently, Brauer algebras and their generalizations,
specially the BMW algebra, have been looked at in the context of quantum
groups and low dimensional topology [11, 3, 13, 8, 12].
   In our problem, the decomposition of ⊗rR V into a direct sum of irreducible
modules for U (V, h) is intimately related to the action of the centralizer
algebra EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ), and the main part of the paper will be devoted to
computing this centralizer algebra. This will be done, following a classical
                                                                              r
approach, by relating it to the multilinear U (V, h)-invariant maps f : V × · · ·
×V → R. These invariants will be the subject of Section 2. Section 3 will
be devoted to the determination of the centralizer algebra, while Section
4 will give a combinatorial description of it, as well as a presentation by
generators and relations. It will turn out that the centralizer algebra looks
like the Signed Brauer Algebra considered in [14, 15] (see Remark 4.8). This
algebra appears, for sufficiently large dimension, as the centralizer   algebra

                                                                   
of the action of the product of orthogonal      groups O   S
on ⊗rC (V ⊗C V ) = ⊗rC S 2 (V ) ⊕ Λ2 (V ) , for a vector space V equipped with
                                         
a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form b : V × V → C, which induces
a nondegenerate bilinear form on V ⊗C V = S 2 (V ) ⊕ Λ2 (V ) (orthogonal
direct sum). In section 5 it will be shown how to use the information on
the centralizer algebra, together with the results in [2], to decompose ⊗rR V
into a direct sum of irreducible U (V, h)-modules. A couple of examples will
be given: the one in [7] mentioned above, and another one considered in [1],
used to classify homogeneous Kähler structures.

                                   2. Invariants
    This section is devoted to prove the next result:
Theorem 2.1. Let V be an n-dimensional complex vector space, endowed
with a nondegenerate hermitian form h : V × V → C and let r ∈ N. If
          r
f : V × · · · ×V → R is a nonzero multilinear U (V, h)-invariant form, then r
is even (r = 2m) and f is a linear combination of the invariant maps:
                           2m
                     V × · · · ×V → R

                                        l=1

where σ ∈ S2m (the symmetric group on {1, . . . , 2m}), δ1 , . . . , δm ∈ {0, 1},
J : V → V is the multiplication by i ∈ C (i2 = −1), and h | i denotes the
real part of h (so that h(v, w) = hv | wi + ihv | Jwi for any v, w ∈ V ).

   In case dimC V ≥ r, this appears in [10]. For arbitrary r, it is asserted
in [7] without proof. A proof will be provided here, which will be based on
methods to be used later on.

  Throughout the paper (V, h), J and h | i will be assumed to satisfy the
hypotheses of Theorem 2.1.

  Let r ∈ N, for any l ∈ {1, . . . , r} consider the R-linear map:
                      Jl : ⊗rR V −→ ⊗rR V
                    v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr 7→ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Jvl ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr
(action of J on the lth -spot). Then Jl ∈ EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ), the centralizer
algebra.
   As a general rule, the elements of the centralizer algebra will act on the
right.
   Let J = algR {J1 , . . . , Jr } the (real) subalgebra of EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ) gen-
erated by the Jl ’s. It is clear the J is isomorphic, as an algebra, to ⊗rR C,
under the map that sends Jl to 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ i ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 (i in the lth slot) for
any l. Note that for any 1 ≤ l 6= m ≤ r, 21 (1 ± Jl Jm ) is an idempotent in J
since Jl2 = −1 for any l. For any nonempty subset P ⊆ {1, . . . , r} and any
p ∈ P, let P c = {1, . . . , r} \ P and consider the following element of J :
                              1    Y               Y
                 eP = r−1             (1 − Jp Jq )     (1 + Jp Jq ) .

                               p6=q∈P             q∈P

Then:
Proposition 2.2. Under the conditions above:
   (1) eP does not depend on the chosen element p ∈ P.
   (2) eP is a primitive idempotent of J .
   (3) Given any p ∈ {1, . . . , r}, J = ⊕p∈P⊆{1,...,r} CeP .
Proof. The R-linear map C ⊗R C → C ⊕ C, α ⊗ β 7→ (αβ, αβ̄), yields an
algebra isomorphism. Therefore, as real algebras, J ∼        = ⊗rR C ∼
                                                                         r−1
                                                                     = C2 . Now,
fix p ∈ P ⊆ {1, . . . , r}; then if p ∈ P ′ ⊆ {1, . . . , r} and q ∈ P \ P ′ , eP eP ′
contains the factor (1−Jp Jq )(1+Jp Jq ) = 0, and hence eP eP ′ = 0. The same
argument works for any q ∈ P ′ \ P. Therefore eP and eP ′ are orthogonal
idempotents. Since there are 2r−1 subsets P ⊆ {1, . . . , r} containing p and
J is an algebra over C, where the action of C is given “on the pth slot”
(J ∼= ⊗rR C), to prove (2) and (3) it is enough to check that eP is nonzero
for any p ∈ P ⊆ {1, . . . , r}. For simplicity, and without loss of generality,
assume p = 1. Then 2r−1 eP is the sum of 2r−1 summands ±J1m J2δ2 · · · Jrδr ,
with δl = 0 or 1, m ≥ 0 and m = δ2 + · · · + δr . All these summands are
linearly independent (over R) in J ∼      = ⊗rR C.
                                                                    1 Q
   It remains (1) to be proved. Take p 6= p′ ∈ P, eP = 2r−1             p6=q∈P (1 −
       Q                        ′       1   Q                    Q
Jp Jq ) q∈P c (1 + Jp Jq ) and eP = 2r−1 p′ 6=q∈P (1 − Jp Jq ) q∈P c (1 + Jp′ Jq ).
                                                              ′

Notice that for any s 6= t in {1, . . . , r}
                     (1 − Js Jt )Js = Js + Jt = (1 − Js Jt )Jt
                    (1 + Js Jt )Js = Js − Jt = −(1 + Js Jt )Jt

and hence              (
                           eP Jp = eP Jq    for any q ∈ P,
                                                                              (2.3)

So that, since Jp2 = −1,

                   0    if either s ∈ P, t ∈ P c or s ∈ P c , t ∈ P,
eP (1 − Js Jt ) =

while

eP (1 + Js Jt ) =

Therefore eP e′P = eP and, with the same argument, eP e′P = e′P , whence
eP = e′P .                                                            

that ΨP (x) = ΨP (xeP ) for any x ∈ ⊗rR V , and then ΨP restricts to ΦP ,

This is well defined because of Lemma 2.5                                
  Now, Corollary 2.4 and Proposition 2.6 yield:
Corollary 2.8. Fix p ∈ {1, . . . , r}, then the U (V, h)-module ⊗rR V is iso-

where VlP = V if l ∈ P, while VlP = V ∗ otherwise.                               
   Notice that  ⊗rR Vis a complex vector space with the action of C on the
pth slot, and that the isomorphism in Corollary 2.8 is then an isomorphism
of complex vector spaces too.
   The final prerequisite in the proof of Theorem 2.1 is the next straightfor-
ward result:
Lemma 2.9. Let g be a real Lie algebra, ρ : g → EndC (W ) a complex
representation of g, f : W → R a linear g-invariant map (f (x.w) = f (w)
for any x ∈ g, w ∈ W ). Then there is a complex linear g-invariant map
g : W → C such that f is the real part of g (f = Re g).               

Proof of Theorem 2.1. From the previous results we obtain:

(The last equality is due to the fact that U (V, h) is a form of GLC (V ).) But
the invariant theory of GLC (V ) [20] shows that
      {T : V1P ⊗C · · · ⊗C VrP → C | T is C-linear and GLC (V )-invariant.}
is trivial unless r is even, r = 2m, and P contains exactly m elements. In
this latter case, P = {l1 , . . . , lm } (l1 = 1), P c = {s1 , . . . , sm } and any such
invariant T is a (complex) linear combination of invariants of the form

where wl = vl ∈ V for l ∈ P, wl = ϕl ∈ V ∗ for l ∈ P c , and σ ∈ Sm , the
symmetric group on {1, . . . , m}.
   Taking into account the definitions of the isomorphisms ΦP and homo-
morphisms ΨP in Proposition 2.6 and Equation (2.7), any U (V, h)-invariant
linear map T : ⊗rR V → C is a complex linear combination of the maps

proof.                                                                   

   A final remark for this section is that using the invariant theory for
SLC (V ) instead of GLC (V ) and the same arguments as above, one arrives
at:
Proposition 2.10. The invariant multilinear SU (V, h)-invariant maps f :
      r
V × · · · ×V → R are exactly the linear combinations of the maps:

where n = dimC V , m, s ≥ 0 with n = 2m + ns and σ ∈ Sr .                                       

                                   3. Centralizer algebra
   To compute the centralizer algebra EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ), it is enough to use
the fact that EndR (⊗   r
                       R V ) is isomorphic (as vector spaces and as U (V, h)-
modules) to ⊗R VR ⊗R ⊗rR V , where VR∗ denotes the dual as a real vector
                r   ∗
                                  

space, to distinguish it from V ∗ = HomC (V, C) (the dual as a complex vec-
tor space). But V is isomorphic to VR∗ as U (V, h)-module by means of h | i
(V → VR∗ , v 7→ hv | −i, is an isomorphism). Therefore, EndR (⊗rR V ) is iso-
morphic to ⊗2r    ∗
              R VR , which is naturally identified with the space of multilinear
                        2r
maps: f : V × · · · ×V → R. Under these isomorphims, the centralizer al-
gebra EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ) (which is the subalgebra of EndR (⊗rR V ) fixed under
the action of U (V, h)) corresponds to the space of multilinear and U (V, h)-
invariant maps.

   Hence, to compute EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ) one has just to keep track of the iso-
morphisms above. Let us proceed with an example: consider the multilinear
U (V, h)-invariant map
       f : V × V × V × V × V × V −→ R
                                                                                          (3.1)
                   (v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 , v5 , v6 ) 7→ hv1 | Jv3 ihv2 | Jv4 ihv5 | Jv6 i

and let {el }2n                                        2n
              l=1 be a basis (over R) of V , and {fl }l=1 its dual basis relative
to h | i (so that hep | fq i = δpq for any p, q). Let e∗l = hel | −i, fl∗ =
hfl | −i ∈ VR∗ for any l. Then notice that the bilinear U (V, h)-invariant
maps (v, w) 7→ hv | wi and (v, w) 7→ hv | Jwi correspond in VR∗ ⊗R VR∗ to
P2n ∗        ∗
                    P2n ∗        ∗
   l=1 el ⊗ fl and    l=1 el ⊗ (fl ◦ J) respectively. Thus, the multilinear map
f in (3.1) corresponds to:

   A marked diagram on 2r vertices is a graph with 2r vertices arranged
in two rows of r vertices each, one above the other, and r edges such that
each vertex is incident to precisely one edge; the rightmost vertex of each
‘horizontal’ edge (i.e., joining vertices in the same row) and the bottommost
vertex of each ‘vertical’ edge (i.e., joining vertices in different rows) may (or
may not) be ‘marked’.
   There are (2r − 1)!! ‘unmarked diagrams’ and, therefore, 2r (2r − 1)!!
marked diagrams. The unmarked diagrams form a basis of the classical
Brauer algebra.
   Any such marked diagram represents an element of the centralizer algebra
EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ). For instance, the marked diagram

   Let Dmarked
         r        denote the real vector space with a basis formed by the
marked diagrams with 2r vertices, numbered from 1 to r from left to right
in the top row and from r + 1 to 2r from left to right on the bottom row.
The procedure above provides a map from the set of marked diagrams into
EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ) and hence a linear map
                           ρ : Dmarked
                                r      −→ EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ).
This linear map ρ is onto because of Theorem 3.4 (or Theorem 2.1).
Proposition 4.1. ρ is a bijection if and only if n ≥ r.
Proof. Let X be a marked diagram and let us split the edges in X according
as wether its rightmost or bottommost vertex is marked or not:
             X + = {(p, q) edge in X | p < q and q is not marked},
             X − = {(p, q) edge in X | p < q and q is marked},
  Assume X + = {(p1 , q1 ), . . . , (ps , qs )} and X − = {(ps+1 , qs+1 ), . . . , (pr , qr )}.
Let {dl }nl=1 be an h-orthogonal basis of V as a complex vector space (that is,
h(dl , dm ) = 0 for l 6= m), so that {d1 , . . . , dn , Jd1 , . . . , Jdn } is an orthogonal
basis of V relative to h | i. Through the natural isomorphisms considered in
Section 3, ρ(X) corresponds to the multilinear invariant map:
                                            Y                  Y
              fX : (v1 , . . . , v2r ) 7→ ±      hvp | vq i           hvp | Jvq i
                                          (p,q)∈X +         (p,q)∈X −

(the ± sign appears due to the skew symmetry of J relative to h | i).
   If n ≥ r, take vpl = dl = vql for l = 1, . . . , s and vpl = Jdl , vql = dl for
l = s + 1, . . . , r. Then fX (v1 , . . . , v2r ) 6= 0, while fY (v1 , . . . , v2r ) = 0 for any
Y 6= X, due to the orthogonality of the chosen basis. This shows that for
n ≥ r, ρ is one-to-one, and hence a bijection.
   However, if n ≤ r − 1, consider the element z ∈ EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ) given by
                                                              X
                                                                   (−1)σ ρ(σr ) ,
                                                                                     
          z = (1 − J1 J2 )(1 − J1 J3 ) · · · (1 − J1 Jr )
                                                              σ∈Sr

where   (−1)σ   denotes the signature of σ. Notice that
                                           X
                       z = 2r−1 e{1,...,r}   (−1)σ ρ(σr ) .
                                                         
                                                                                         (4.2)
                                               σ∈Sr

  When expanded, z appears as the image under ρ of a nontrivial linear
combination of different marked diagrams without horizontal edges. For
any σ ∈ Sr and any l ∈ {1, . . . , r}, ρ(σ)Jl = Jσ(l) ρ(σ) (remember that
EndU (V,h) (⊗rR V ) acts on the right) so, due to Proposition 2.2(1), for any
σ ∈ Sr one has e{1,...,r} ρ(σ) = ρ(σ)e{1,...,r} . Hence the isomorphism
                    Φ{1,...,r} : ⊗rR V e{1,...,r} −→ ⊗rC V
                                      

                          (v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr )e{1,...,r} 7→ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr
given in Proposition 2.6, preserves the action of Sr . Since n ≥ r − 1,
            σ                     r
P
   σ∈Sr (−1) σ acts trivially on ⊗C V and, therefore, z in (4.2) acts trivially
     r
on ⊗R V . That is, z = 0. Thus ρ is not one-to-one in this case.             

     Then

where γ(X, Y ) ∈ R is defined below and X ∗ Y is the marked diagram whose
vertices are the vertices in the upper row of X and the vertices in the lower
row of Y with the horizontal edges that appear in these rows. The rightmost
vertices of these horizontal edges inherit the marking in X or Y . Moreover,
there is a vertical edge joining any upper vertex of X with a lower vertex of Y
precisely if there is a path in G(X, Y ) joining these vertices. The lowermost
vertex of any of these vertical edges is marked if and only if there is an odd
number of marked vertices along the corresponding path in G(X, Y ). (For
the example above, X ∗ Y appears in (4.3).) Besides,
    (1) Let p be any path in G(X, Y ), we move the (say) s marks on the
         vertices along p to the bottommost vertex and define

  The definitions of γ(p) and γ(l) are made so as to take into account the
skew-symmetry of J and the fact that J 2 = −1.
  Finally, define
                                                                          Y             Y

  The resulting algebra (over the real field) thus defined over Dmarked
                                                                 r      will
be denoted by Dmarked
                r     (n).
Proposition 4.6. Dmarked
                  r      (n) is an associative algebra for any r, n ∈ N.
Proof. The product in Dmarked
                           r      (n) is defined in such a way as to ensure that
ρ : Dmarked
     r      (n) →  End  U (V,h) (⊗ r V ) is a homomorphism of algebras. Hence
                                   R
the result is obvious for n ≥ r by Proposition 4.1. In general, formulas (4.4)
and (4.5) show that for X, Y ∈ Dmarkedr      ,

                                  XY = (2n)l(X,Y ) s(X, Y )X ∗ Y,
where l(X, Y ) ∈ Z≥0 is the number of loops in G(X, Y ) and s(X, Y ) ∈
{0, 1, −1}. Both l(X, Y ) and s(X, Y ) are independent of n. The associativity
of Dmarked
     r     (n) is equivalent to the validity of (XY )Z = X(Y Z) for any
marked diagrams X, Y, Z, or to the validity of

  (2n)l(X,Y )+l(X∗Y,Z) s(X, Y )s(X ∗ Y, Z)
                                                              = (2n)l(Y,Z)+l(X,Y ∗Z) s(Y, Z)s(X, Y ∗ Z)
which is satisfied if and only if for any marked diagrams X, Y, Z
              (
                l(X, Y ) + l(X ∗ Y, Z) = l(Y, Z) + l(X, Y ∗ Z)
                s(X, Y )s(X ∗ Y, Z) = s(Y, Z)s(X, Y ∗ Z)

which does not depend on n. Therefore Dmarked
                                          r     (n) is associative if and only
          marked
if so is Dr      (m) for m large enough, which is indeed the case.          
Remark 4.7. The proof above suggests the consideration of the algebra
Dmarked
 r      (x) over R(x), with a basis formed by the marked diagrams and
multiplication given by
                                       XY = xl(X,Y ) s(X, Y )X ∗ Y
for any marked diagrams X, Y ; in analogy with the Brauer algebras Brr (x)
considered in [19, 9].

Remark 4.8. Given an edge of a marked diagram, call it positive if its bot-
tommost or rightmost vertex is not marked, and negative otherwise. Hence
the marked diagrams can be identified with the signed diagrams in [14, 15].
The algebra Dmarked
                r   (x) is then defined over the same vector space as the
Signed Brauer Algebra defined in these references, although the multiplica-
tion is different.

   Let us proceed now to give a presentation of Dmarked
                                                 r      (x) by generators and
relations. We will assume r ≥ 4, the situation for r < 3 is simpler and can
be deduced easily along the same lines. First, let us consider the following

   These generate the algebra Dmarked  r      (x), because the σl ’s generate the sym-
metric group, σJ1 σ −1 = Jσ(l) and σc12 σ −1 = cσ(1)σ(2) for any σ in the
symmetric group.
   Then the following relations among these elements are easily checked:
      (i) σl2 = 1, 1 ≤ l ≤ r − 1,
     (ii) σl σm = σm σl , 1 ≤ l, m ≤ r − 1, |l − m| ≥ 2,

                              MODIFIED BRAUER ALGEBRA                                         15


   Take the free associative algebra D over R(x) generated by elements
σ1 , . . . , σr−1 , J1 , c12 , subject to the relations (i)–(xiv) above. Dmarkedr    (x) is a
quotient of this algebra, and to show that they are isomorphic it is enough to
check that the dimension of D is 2r (2r − 1)!!. To do so, first the subalgebra
generated by the σl ’s is (isomorphic to) the group algebra of the symmetric
group Sr (in principle it is a quotient of the group algebra, but the corre-
sponding subalgebra of Dmarked      r      (x) is the whole group algebra). Moreover,
define recursively in D the new elements Jl+1 = σl Jl σl , 1 ≤ l ≤ r − 2. Be-
cause of (v) one has σJl σ −1 = Jσ(l) for any σ ∈ Sr ⊆ D. Then relation (vi)
yields J1 J2 = J2 J1 and with this one proves easily that Jl Jm = Jm Jl for
any l, m, and that the subalgebra of D generated by the σl ’s and JQ                 1 is the
span of the elements JP σ, where P ⊆ {1, . . . , r}, σ ∈ Sr and JP = p∈P Jp
(J∅ = 1).
   Now define in D the elements cpq (p 6= q) by cpq = σc12 σ −1 , where
σ ∈ Sr satisfies σ(1) = p, σ(2) = q. This is well defined by the rela-
tions in (viii) and, because of (ix), cpq = cqp for any p, q. Then rela-
tion (xii) is equivalent to J3 c12 = c12 J3 which, by conjugation with suit-
able elements of Sr , yields Js cpq = cpq Js for different s, p, q. Also, rela-
tion (xiv) becomes c12 c34 = c34 c12 , and again, by conjugation, it yields
cpq cp′ q′ = cp′ q′ cpq for different p, q, p′ , q ′ . Finally, for distinct elements p, q, q ′ ,
cpq cpq′ = cpq (qq ′ )cpq (qq ′ ) = cpq (qq ′ ) = (qq ′ )cpq′ , thanks to relation (x) and
its conjugates. Besides, cpq Jp cpq = 0 by (vi), while cpq Jp cpq′ = −cpq Jq′ cpq′ =
−Jq′ cpq cpq′ , and also cpq Jp cpq′ = −cpq Jq cpq′ = −cpq cpq′ Jq for different p, q, q ′ .
With all these relations, any word in the generators belongs to the linear
span of the elements

                                   JQ cp1 q1 · · · cps qs JP c σ,                         (4.9)

where p1 < · · · < ps , q1 , . . . , qs are different elements in {1, . . . , r}, Q ⊆
{q1 , . . . , qs }, P c ⊆ {1, . . . , r} \ {p1 , . . . , ps } and σ ∈ Sr . But cpq (pq) = cpq by
relation (ix) and cpq Jq (pq) = cpq (pq)Jp = cpq Jp = −cpq Jq , so one can assume
that σ(pl ) < σ(ql ) for any l = 1, . . . , s. With this extra condition on σ in
(4.9), each element in (4.9) is in bijection with a unique marked diagram.
   This finishes the proof of:

Theorem 4.10. Assuming r ≥ 4, Dmarked       r      (x) is the associative algebra over
R(x) generated by {σ1 , . . . , σr−1 , J1 , c12 }, subject to the relations (i)–(xiv).
                                                                                    

Remark 4.11. For r = 3, it is enough to consider relations (i), (iii), (iv),
(vi), (vii), and (ix)–(xiii); while for r = 2 (i), (iv), (vi), (vii), (ix), (xi) and
(xii) are sufficient.



                      5. Decomposition into irreducibles
   The results in the previous sections, together with [2] (see also [18]), make
it easy to decompose ⊗rR V into a direct sum of irreducible U (V, h)-modules.
First, an element p ∈ {1, . . . , r} is fixed, and for simplicity we will take
16                                ALBERTO ELDUQUE


p = 1. Then, from Proposition 2.2, Corollary 2.4 and Proposition 2.6
                          M
                 ⊗rR V =        ⊗rR V eP
                                     

                            1∈P⊆{1,...,r}
                               r  
                            ∼
                              M       r                       
                                                      r−q ∗ 
                                            ⊗qC V ⊗C ⊗C
                                                 
                            =                            V
                                      q
                                q=1

and, therefore,  it is enough to decompose the module (over C) Vq,r−q :=
   q          r−q ∗ 
 ⊗C V ⊗C ⊗C V into a direct sum of irreducible U (V, h)-modules. Let
us think in terms of the associated Lie algebra u(V, h), which is a form of
the general linear Lie algebra glC (V ). The irreducible u(V, h)-submodules of
Vq,r−q over C are exactly the irreducible glC (V )-submodules, and these are
determined in [18] and [2]: the irreducible glC (V )-submodules of Vq,r−q are
in one-to-one correspondence with the pairs (τ, L) where:
     (1) L = [(m1 , m′1 ), . . . , (ms , m′s )] is a sequence of pairs with 1 ≤ m1 <
         m2 < · · · < ms ≤ q, m′1 , . . . , m′s are different elements in {q +
         1, . . . , r} (s ≤ min{q, r − q}). L indicates the slots where a contrac-
         tion is made among V and V ∗ .
     (2) τ = (τ + , τ − ) is a pair of standard rational tableaux, where τ + (re-
         spectively τ − ) is obtained by filling the boxes in a Young frame with
         the numbers in {1, . . . , q} \ {m1 , . . . , ms } (resp. in {q + 1, . . . , r} \
         {m′1 , . . . , m′s }). Being standard means that the numbers strictly in-
         crease from left to right across each row and from top to bottom in
         each column.
     (3) If dimC V = n < r, an extra technical condition has to be satisfied
         (see [2, Theorem 1.11]) that, in particular, forces the sum of the
         number of rows in τ + and τ − to be at most n.
Example. r = 7, q = 3, L = [(1, 6), (2, 4)], τ + = 3 , τ − = 5 .
                                                             7
   If we fix a basis of V over C, so that glC (V ) ∼= gln , the complex Lie algebra
of n×n matrices, and consider the Cartan subalgebra h formed by the diago-
nal matrices, let ǫl ∈ h∗ (l = 1, . . . , n) be given by ǫl (diag(α1 , . . . , αn )) = αl .
Then the highest weight of the irreducible module associated to a pair (τ, L)
as above is λ1 ǫ1 + · · · + λn ǫn where λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λt > 0 are the lengths of
the rows of τ + , while −λn ≥ −λn−1 ≥ · · · ≥ −λn−t′ +1 > 0 are the lengths
of the rows of τ − and λt+1 = · · · = λn−t′ = 0.
   Once Vq,r−q is decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible modules for
U (V, h) over C, what is left to be done is to check which of these modules
remain irreducible as modules for U (V, h) over R and which of them do not.
The former ones are the complex or quaternionic irreducible representations
of U (V, h), while the latter ones are the real representations (notation as in
[6, § 26]. If M is an irreducible U (V, h)-module over C which is real, then
there exists an irreducible U (V, h)-module over R such that M ∼             = C ⊗R N .
Thus, as a module over R, M is the direct sum of two copies of N .
   But if q 6=  r − q (in particular, if r is odd), then i1 ∈ u(V,           h) acts as
 q − (r − q) i1 = (2q − r)i1 6= 0 on Vq,r−q = ⊗qC V ⊗C ⊗C                  r−q ∗ 

hence the action of scalar multiplication by imaginary complex numbers is

“included” in the action of u(V, h). Thus all the irreducible submodules of
Vq,r−q over C are complex, so they are irreducible as modules over R.
   The case of q = r − q will be treated in the most interesting case of
h being definite, so U (V, h) ∼     = U (n) is a compact form of GLC (V ). The
argument above shows that the action of i1 ∈ u(V, h) on Vq,q (r − q = q)
is trivial, so we have to consider only the action of su(V, h). Hence, the
highest weights of the irreducible glC (V )-submodules in Vq,q are of the form
λ1 ǫ1 + · · · + λn ǫn , with λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λn and λ1 + · · · + λn = 0; so that
λ1 ǫ1 + · · · + λn ǫn = (λ1 − λ2 )ω1 + · · · + (λn−1 − λn )ωn−1 , where ω1 = ǫ1 , ω2 =
ǫ1 + ǫ2 , . . . , ωn−1 = ǫ1 + · · · + ǫn−1 , are the fundamental dominant weights
of slC (V ). Notice that the integers λ1 − λ2 , . . . , λn−1 − λn , together with the
condition λ1 + · · · + λn = 0, determine λ1 , . . . , λn . The conditions for this
highest weight to yield a real representation are [6, Proposition 6.24]:
       λl − λl+1 = λn−l − λn−l+1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ n − 1,                               (5.1)
       n odd, or n = 4k, or n = 4k + 2 and λ2k+1 − λ2k+2 even.                  (5.2)
But (5.1) is equivalent to λl + λn+1−l = 0 for any l, which together with
the condition λ1 + · · · + λn = 0 yields λl + λn+1−l = 0, which implies
λ2k+1 − λ2k+2 = 2λ2k+1 for n = 4k + 2. Therefore, the condition (5.2) is
superfluous, while the condition (5.1) is equivalent to the restriction of the
Young frames of both τ + and τ − being the same.
  The above discussion is summarized in:
Proposition 5.3. Assume h is definite. Then:
    (1) For p 6= q, the irreducible U (V, h)-submodules of ⊗pC V ⊗C ⊗qC V ∗
                                                                             
        over C are all complex, so they remain irreducible as modules over
        R.
    (2) The same    happens if p = q for the irreducible U (V, h)-modules of
           q 
         ⊗C V ⊗C ⊗qC V ∗ over C which correspond to pairs (τ, L) where
        the Young frames of τ + and τ − are different. 
    (3) The irreducible U (V, h)-submodules of ⊗pC V ⊗C ⊗qC V ∗ over C
                                                                     

        which correspond to pairs (τ, L), with equal Young frames of τ + and
        τ − are real, so they split into a direct sum of two copies of an irre-
        ducible U (V, h)-module over R.
  As a first example, consider V ⊗R V , which splits as:
       V ⊗R V = (V ⊗R V )e1 ⊕ (V ⊗R V )e2 ≃ (V ⊗C V ) ⊕ (V ⊗C V ∗ )
                ≃ S 2 (V ) ⊕ Λ2 (V ) ⊕ C ⊕ slC (V )

where e1 = 21 (1 − J1 J2 ), e2 = 21 (1 + J1 J2 ). Here S 2 (V ) (the symmetric
tensors) and Λ2 (V ) (skew-symmetric tensors) are irreducible as U (V, h)-
modules over R, while C is a direct sum of two trivial one-dimensional
modules over R, and slC (V ) = su(V, h) ⊕ isu(V, h) is a direct sum of two
copies of su(V, h).

  In the remaining part of this paper, we will consider the motivating ex-
ample of Gray and Hervella [7] considered in the Introduction, as well as
another related example by Abbena and Garbiero [1].

Example. (Gray-Hervella 1978 [7])
  Since V ∼= V ∗ as modules for U (V, h) over R, the problem described in
the Introduction amounts to decompose
                W = {x ∈ ⊗3R V : x(23) = −x = xJ2 J3 }
                                   1
                   = {x ∈ (⊗3R V ) (1 − J2 J3 ) : x(23) = −x}
                                   2
into a direct sum of irreducible submodules for U (V, h). First notice that
             1                1             1
               (1 − J2 J3 ) = (1 − J2 J3 ) (1 − J1 J3 + 1 + J1 J3 )
             2                2             2
                            = e{1,2,3} + e{2,3}
(a sum of orthogonal idempotents) in the notation of Section 2. Hence, by
Proposition 2.6
               1
          ⊗3R V (1 − J2 J3 ) = ⊗3R V e{1,2,3} ⊕ ⊗3R V e{2,3}
                                                    
                2
                             ∼
                             = (V ⊗C V ⊗C V ) ⊕ (V ∗ ⊗C V ⊗C V )
and from this isomorphism, it immediately follows that
                  W ∼
                    = V ⊗C Λ2 (V ) ⊕ V ∗ ⊗C Λ2 (V ) ,
                                                     

and it is enough to decompose each one of these two summands into irre-
ducible glC (V )-modules.
   The first summand is (V ⊗C V ⊗C V ) 21 (1 − (23)) and, since in the group
algebra CS3 the idempotent 12 (1 − (23)) = eT1 + eT2 is the sum of two
orthogonal primitive idempotents, where
                         T1 = 2 ,        T2 = 2 1 ,
                              3               3
                              1
(that is, eT1 = 16 σ∈S3 (−1)σ σ and eT2 = 31 1 + (12) 1 − (23) ), it follows
                  P                                           

that V ⊗C Λ2 (V ) = (⊗3C V )eT1 ⊕ (⊗3C V )eT2 (direct sum of two irreducible
modules if dimC V ≥ 3), which under the isomorphisms correspond to:
              W1 = {x ∈ ⊗3R V : xJ1 = xJ2 = xJ3 , xeT1 = x},
              W2 = {x ∈ ⊗3R V : xJ1 = xJ2 = xJ3 , xeT2 = x}.
But xeT2 = x if and only if x(23) = −x and x(1 + (123) + (132)) = 0. For
any x satisfing these two conditions, one checks easily that the condition
xJ1 = xJ2 follows from xJ2 = xJ3 . Hence
                  W2 = {x ∈ W : x(1 + (123) + (132)) = 0},
and, similarly,
                        W1 = {x ∈ W : x(12) = −x}.
On the other hand, assuming dimC V ≥ 3, V ∗ ⊗C Λ2 (V ) decomposes [2] into:
     • ker c, where c : V ∗ ⊗C Λ2 (V ) → V , f ⊗(u⊗v−v⊗u)
                                                         7→ f (u)v−f

       which corresponds to the pair (τ, L), with τ = 1 , 3 and L = ∅.

      • { nl=1 u∗l ⊗ (ul ⊗ v − v ⊗ ul ) : v ∈ V } ∼
                                                  = V , where {ul }nl=1 and {u∗l }nl=1

        are dual bases of V and V over C. This is a ‘diagonal’ submodule
        of the ones that correspond to the pairs (τ, L) with L = [(1, 3)] and
        τ = ( 2 , ∅) and with L = [(2, 3)] and τ = ( 1 , ∅).
  Under the isomorphisms, these submodules correspond to:
             W3 = {x ∈ W : xJ1 = −xJ2 and xc12 = 0}
                   2n
                   X             1
             W4 = { (el ⊗ fl ⊗ v) (1 + J1 J3 )(1 − (23) : v ∈ V }
                                 4
                      l=1

where the el ’s and fl ’s constitute dual bases of V over R relative to h | i.
  The situation for dimC V ≤ 2 is simpler.
  We recover in this way the decomposition given in [7].
Example. (Abbena-Garbiero 1988 [1])
  One has to decompose
                 K = {x ∈ ⊗3R V : x(23) = −x = −xJ2 J3 }
                                  1
                   = {x ∈ (⊗3R V ) (1 + J2 J3 ) : x(23) = −x}.
                                  2
As before, 21 (1 + J2 J3 ) = e{1,2} + e{1,3} , so
                  1
          (⊗3R V ) (1 + J2 J3 ) ∼
                                = (V ⊗C V ⊗C V ∗ ) ⊕ (V ⊗C V ∗ ⊗C V )
                  2
by means of the isomorphism Φ given by
                   1            
  Φ (v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ v3 ) (1 + J2 J3 ) = v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ h(−, v3 ) + v1 ⊗ h(−, v2 ) ⊗ v3 .
                   2
Now, the following diagram is commutative:
                              Φ
      ⊗3R V 12 (1 + J2 J3 ) −−−−→ (V ⊗C V ⊗C V ∗ ) ⊕ (V ⊗C V ∗ ⊗C V )
            
                                                  
           (23)y
                                                  flip
                                                   y

      ⊗3R V 12 (1 + J2 J3 ) −−−−→ (V ⊗C V ⊗C V ∗ ) ⊕ (V ⊗C V ∗ ⊗C V )
            

Here we have on the left the right action of the transposition (23), while on
the right (v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ f )flip = v1 ⊗ f ⊗ v2 and (v1 ⊗ f ⊗ v2 )flip = v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ f
for any v1 , v2 ∈ v and f ∈ V ∗ .
   Therefore, the linear map given by
               1
    K = ⊗3R V      (1 + J2 J3 )(1 − (23)) −→ V ⊗C ⊗C V ∗

                  1                         1
   (v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ v3 ) (1 + J2 J3 )(1 − (23)) 7→ v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ h(−, v3 )−

                                                      v1 ⊗ v3 − h(−, v2 )

is an isomorphism of U (V, h)-modules.
   If dimC V ≥ 3, V ⊗C V ⊗C V ∗ decomposes into the direct sum of the
irreducible glC (V )-modules corresponding to the pairs (τ, L) in the list (see

   With c : V ⊗C V ⊗C V ∗ →V , v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ f 7→ f (v1 )v2 ,the first two modules
correspond to S 2 (V )⊗C V ∗ ∩ker c and Λ2 (V )⊗C V ∗ ∩ker c, while the last
two modules are isomorphic to V . One recovers from here the decomposition
given in [1]. The details are left to the reader.
