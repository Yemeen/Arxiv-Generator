                                                   AdG Γ has the same Zariski closure as Ad G. If α : Γ → GLn (R) is any finite-dimensional represen-
                                                   tation of Γ, we show that α virtually extends to a continuous representation σ of G. Furthermore,
                                                   the image of σ is contained in the Zariski closure of the image of α. When Γ is not discrete, the same
                                                   conclusions are true if we make the additional assumption that the closure of [Γ, Γ] is a finite-index
                                                   subgroup of [G, G] ∩ Γ (and Γ is closed and α is continuous).




                                                                                          1. Introduction
                                               The Margulis Superrigidity Theorem [4, Thm. VII.5.9, p. 230] concerns lattices in semisimple Lie
                                            groups. The author [7] (see [8, §6] for errata) proved an analogue of this fundamental theorem for
                                            many lattices in Lie groups that are not semisimple, with most of his attention devoted to solvable
                                            groups (see 3.2). We now prove that, in the case of solvable groups, there is no need to restrict
                                            attention to lattices—exactly the same result holds for any discrete subgroup.
                                            1.1. Definition. We say that a representation α : Γ → GLn (R) virtually extends to a represen-
                                            tation of G if the restriction of α to some finite-index subgroup of Γ extends to a representation
                                            of G.

                                            1.2. Definition. Let us say that a closed subgroup Γ of a simply connected, solvable Lie group G
                                            is superrigid in G if every finite-dimensional representation α : Γ → GLn (R) virtually extends to a
                                            representation σ of G, such that the image Gσ is contained in the Zariski closure of Γα .

                                            1.3. Remark. By considering induced representations, we see that every finite-index subgroup of a
                                            superrigid subgroup is superrigid.

                                            2.2′ . Definition. If X is a subgroup of a Lie group G, let AdG X denote the (almost) Zariski
                                            closure of AdG X in the real algebraic group Aut G, where G is the Lie algebra of G.

                                            1.4. Theorem ((see 3.5)). Let Γ be a discrete subgroup of a simply connected, solvable Lie group G,
                                            such that AdG Γ = Ad G. Then Γ is superrigid in G.
                                              For subgroups that are not discrete, an additional hypothesis is required.
                                            1.5. Theorem ((see 3.6)). Let Γ be a closed subgroup of a simply connected, solvable Lie group G,
                                            such that AdG Γ = Ad G. If the closure of [Γ, Γ] is a finite-index subgroup of [G, G] ∩ Γ, then Γ is
                                            superrigid in G.
                                               If Γ is superrigid in G, then Γ is also superrigid in any semidirect product A ⋊ G. The follow-
                                            ing theorem shows that combining this observation with Thm. 1.5 is (virtually) the only way to
                                            construct a superrigid subgroup.

3.8. Theorem. A closed subgroup Γ of a simply connected, solvable Lie group G is superrigid iff
Γ has a finite-index subgroup Γ′ , such that
  1. there is a semidirect-product decomposition G = A ⋊ B, with Γ′ ⊂ B and AdB Γ′ = Ad B,
     and
  2. the closure of [Γ′ , Γ′ ] is a finite-index subgroup of [B, B] ∩ Γ′ .
   If Γ is discrete, then Hypothesis (2) of the theorem follows from (1) (see 2.5(1)), so we have the
following corollary.
1.6. Corollary. A discrete subgroup Γ of a simply connected, solvable Lie group G is superrigid
iff there is a semidirect-product decomposition G = A ⋊ B, such that B contains a finite-index
subgroup Γ′ of Γ, and AdB Γ′ = Ad B.

1.7. Acknowledgment. I am grateful to A. Magid for asking the astute question that directed me
to this extension of my earlier work. This research was partially supported by a grant from the
National Science Foundation.

                                           2. Preliminaries
2.1. Definition ([7, Defn. 3.2]). A subgroup A of GLn (R) is said to be almost Zariski closed if
there is a Zariski closed subgroup B of GLn (R), such that B ◦ ⊂ A ⊂ B, where B ◦ is the identity
component of B in the topology of GLn (R) as a C ∞ manifold (not the Zariski topology). There
is little difference between being Zariski closed and almost Zariski closed, because B ◦ always has
finite index in B.

2.2. Definition ([7, Defn. 3.6]). The almost-Zariski closure A of a subgroup A of GLn (R) is the
unique smallest almost-Zariski closed subgroup that contains A. In particular, if A is a subgroup
of a Lie group G, we use AdG A to denote the almost-Zariski closure of AdG A in the real algebraic
group Aut(G), where G is the Lie algebra of G.

2.3. Definition (([7, §5], cf. [2, p. 6])). Let Γ be a closed subgroup of a Lie group G. A syndetic
hull of Γ is a connected subgroup B that contains Γ, such that B/Γ is compact.

2.4. Proposition ([7, Prop. 5.9, p. 168]). Let Γ be a closed subgroup of a connected, solvable Lie
group G, such that AdG Γ contains a maximal compact torus of Ad G. Then Γ has a syndetic hull
in G.

2.5. Lemma ([7, Prop. 5.10 and Cor. 5.11, p. 168]). Suppose Γ is a closed subgroup of a simply
connected, solvable Lie group G, such that AdG Γ = Ad G. Then the closure of [Γ, Γ] contains a
cocompact subgroup of [G, G] ∩ Γ. Furthermore:
   1. If Γ is discrete, then [Γ, Γ] is a finite-index subgroup of [G, G] ∩ Γ.
   2. If Γ is connected, then [Γ, Γ] = [G, G].

2.6. Definition. A real-valued function f on a subset G of GLm (R) is regular if there are poly-
nomials p and q in n2 + 1 variables, such that, for all g ∈ G, we have
                                                                  p(gij , det g −1 )
                       q(gij , det g−1 ) 6= 0    and    f (g) =                      .
                                                                  q(gij , det g −1 )
A function f : G → GLn (R) is regular if each matrix entry of f (g) is a regular function of g.

2.7. Lemma ([7, Prop. 3.16, p. 158]). Suppose G is an almost-Zariski closed subgroup of GLm (R),
and φ : G → GLn (R) is a regular homomorphism. Then Gφ is almost-Zariski closed.

2.8. Lemma ([7, Lem. 3.17, p. 159]). Suppose A and B are almost-Zariski closed subgroups of
GLn (R), such that AB is a subgroup. Then AB is almost Zariski closed.

2.9. Lemma ([7, Cor. 2.19, p. 154]). If N is a connected, normal subgroup of a simply connected,
solvable Lie group G, then G/N is simply connected. Therefore, G/N has no nontrivial compact
subgroups.

2.10. Lemma ((Ado-Iwasawa)). If G is a simply connected, solvable Lie group, then G has a
faithful, finite-dimensional representation α, such that Gα is closed.
Proof. The usual statement of the Ado-Iwasawa Theorem [3, Thm. XVIII.3.1, p. 219] states that G
has a faithful, finite-dimensional representation σ, such that (nil G)σ is unipotent. Hence (nil G)σ is
closed (see 2.13). For the same reason, because G/ nil G is abelian, there is faithful representation τ
of G/ nil G, whose image is closed. The direct sum of σ and τ is the desired representation α.

2.11. Lemma ([7, Lem. 5.6, p. 166]). Let G be a connected, solvable Lie group, and let A be an
almost-Zariski closed subgroup of GLn (R). If ρ : G → GLn (R) is a continuous homomorphism,
such that A contains a maximal compact torus of Gρ , then the inverse image ρ−1 (A) is a connected
subgroup of G.

2.12. Lemma. Let G and H be simply connected, solvable Lie groups. If σ : G → H is a contin-
uous homomorphism, then the kernel of σ is connected.
Proof. Let K = ker σ. Because every connected subgroup of a simply connected, solvable Lie group
is simply connected [3, Thm. XII.2.2, p. 137], we know Gσ is simply connected. In other words,
G/K is simply connected. Because G is connected and solvable, this implies that K is connected
[7, Lem. 2.17, p. 154].

2.13. Lemma ([7, Lem. 3.20, p. 159]). Every connected, unipotent Lie subgroup of GLn (R) is
Zariski closed.

2.14. Lemma ((cf. [1, Cor. I.5.3.7, p. 47])). Let A be a connected, nilpotent, normal subgroup of
a Lie group G. Then AdG nil G is unipotent.
  The following well-known result is a consequence of the fact that maximal compact tori are
conjugate (see [5, Prop. 3.10(2), p. 126] and [9, Cor. 102.9.1, p. 293]).
2.15. Lemma. Let K and G be almost-Zariski closed, connected subgroups of GLn (R). If K is a
normal subgroup of G, then every maximal compact torus of G contains a maximal compact torus
of K.

                              3. The theorems and their proofs
  The following are two versions of the main theorem of [7]. In this section, we eliminate the
cocompactness assumption in these results (see 3.4) and prove a converse (see 3.8).
3.1. Theorem ([7, Cor. 6.6, p. 175]). Let Γ be a closed, cocompact subgroup of a simply connected,
solvable Lie group G, and assume AdG Γ = Ad G. Suppose α : Γ → GLn (R) is a representation
of Γ. If Γα and Z(Γα ) are connected, and ([G, G] ∩ Γ)α is unipotent, then α extends to a homo-
morphism from G to Γα .

3.2. Corollary ([7, Cor. 6.8, p. 176]). Let Γ be a lattice subgroup of a simply connected, solvable
Lie group G, such that AdG Γ = Ad G. Then Γ is superrigid in G.

3.3. Remark. If one is interested only in (1.4), not the more precise results such as Thm 3.4 and its
corollaries, a direct proof can be obtained from the proof of (3.4) by appealing to Cor. 3.2 instead
of Thm. 3.1. A short, fairly easy proof of Cor. 3.2 appears in [8, §2].

3.4. Theorem. Let Γ be a closed subgroup of a simply connected, solvable Lie group G, and assume
AdG Γ = Ad G. Suppose α : Γ → GLn (R) is a representation of Γ. If Γα and Z(Γα ) are connected,
and ([G, G] ∩ Γ)α is unipotent, then α extends to a homomorphism from G to Γα .
Proof. Because AdG Γ = Ad G, we know that Γ has a syndetic hull B in G (see 2.4). Then α
extends to a homomorphism σ : B → Γα (see 3.1). From Lem. 2.5(2), we see that ([G, G] ∩ B)σ =
[B, B]σ ⊂ [Γα , Γα ] is unipotent, so there is no harm in replacing Γ with B. Thus, we may assume
Γ is connected.
   We may assume G ⊂ GLn (R) (see 2.10), so there is no harm in speaking of the almost-Zariski
closure of G or of its subgroups. Let π : G × Γα → G be the projection onto the first factor.
   Let X ⊂ Γ × Γα be the graph of α. It suffices to find a closed subgroup Y of G × Γα such that
X ⊂ Y , Y ∩ Γα = e, and Y π = G. For then Y is the graph of a homomorphism G → Γα that
extends α, as desired.
               π                           π                                                    π
   Because X ⊃ X π = Γ, and AdG X is almost Zariski closed (see 2.7), we have AdG X ⊃
                            π
AdG Γ = Ad G, so G ⊂ X Z(G). Thus, letting X̂ = X Z(G)◦ , we have G ⊂ X̂ π .
   Let Y be a connected subgroup of X̂ that contains X and is maximal, subject to the conditions
that Y ∩ Γα = e and Y π ⊂ G. We claim that Y π = G (which will complete the proof). If not, then,
because G ⊂ X̂ π , there is a one-parameter subgroup A of X̂ such that Aπ is contained in G, but is
not contained in Y π . From Lem. 2.5(2), we know that [X, X] = [X, X] ⊂ X ⊂ Y , so Y is normal
in X̂; hence AY is a subgroup. Furthermore, because G is simply connected and Y π is connected,
we know that G/Y π has no nontrivial compact subgroups (see 2.9). Because Aπ 6⊂ Y π , this implies
that aπ 6∈ Y π , for all a ∈ A − {e}; therefore (AY ) ∩ Γα = Y ∩ Γα is trivial. This contradicts the
maximality of Y .

3.5. Corollary ((cf. pf. of [7, Cor. 6.7, p. 176])). Let Γ be a discrete subgroup of a simply con-
nected, solvable Lie group G, and assume AdG Γ = Ad G. Suppose α : Γ → GLn (R) is a homomor-
phism, such that Γα is connected. Then there is a homomorphism σ : G → Γα and a finite sub-
group Z0 of Z(Γα ) such that γ σ ∈ γ α Z0 , for every γ ∈ Γ. In particular, σ virtually extends α.
  To obtain the same conclusion for subgroups that are not discrete, we add the conclusion of
Lem. 2.5(1) as a hypothesis.
3.6. Corollary ((cf. pf. of [7, Cor. 6.7, p. 176])). Let Γ be a closed subgroup of a simply connected,
solvable Lie group G, such that the closure of [Γ, Γ] is a finite-index subgroup of [G, G] ∩ Γ, and
assume AdG Γ = Ad G. Suppose α : Γ → GLn (R) is a homomorphism, such that Γα is connected.
Then there is a homomorphism σ : G → Γα and a finite subgroup Z0 of Z(Γα ) such that γ σ ∈ γ α Z0 ,
for every γ ∈ Γ. In particular, σ virtually extends α.
  Without the additional hypothesis, we obtain only the following weaker result, by using the fact
that, although the closure of [Γ, Γ] may not have finite index in [G, G] ∩ Γ, it is cocompact (see 2.5).
3.7. Corollary ((cf. pf. of [7, Cor. 6.7, p. 176])). Let Γ be a closed subgroup of a simply connected,
solvable Lie group G, and assume AdG Γ = Ad G. Suppose α : Γ → GLn (R) is a homomorphism,
such that Γα is connected. Then there is a homomorphism σ : G → Γα and a compact subgroup Z0
of Z(Γα ) such that γ σ ∈ γ α Z0 , for every γ ∈ Γ.

3.8. Theorem. A closed subgroup Γ of a simply connected, solvable Lie group G is superrigid iff
Γ has a finite-index subgroup Γ′ , such that
                             SUPERRIGID SUBGROUPS OF SOLVABLE LIE GROUPS                                       5

  1. there is a semidirect-product decomposition G = A ⋊ B, with Γ′ ⊂ B and AdB Γ′ = Ad B,
     and
  2. the closure of [Γ′ , Γ′ ] is a finite-index subgroup of [B, B] ∩ Γ′ .
Proof. (⇒) (1) There is a faithful representation α : G → GLn (R), such that Gα is closed (see 2.10).
(So Γα is also closed.) Because Γ is superrigid, we know that, after replacing Γ by a finite-index
subgroup, the homomorphism α|Γ extends to a homomorphism σ : G → Γα . Because G is simply
connected, we may lift σ to a homomorphism σ    e: G → Γ fα , where Γ
                                                                    fα is the universal cover of Γα .
By combining Lem. 2.7 with the fact that Γα = Gσ , we see that
                                 AdGσ Γα = AdGσ Γα = AdGσ Gσ = Ad Gσ .
Therefore, by passing to the covering group Gσe , we have AdGσe Γσe = Ad Gσe . Thus, letting K =
    e, we see that AdG KΓ = Ad G. Furthermore, K is connected (see 2.12), we have K ∩ Γ = e,
ker σ
because σ|Γ = α is faithful, and we know that KΓ is closed, because Γα is closed. So Lem. 3.9
below implies that there is a semidirect-product decomposition G = A ⋊ B with K ⊂ A and Γ ⊂ B.
Because AdG AΓ ⊃ AdG KΓ = Ad G, we see that AdB Γ = Ad B.
   (2) Because Γ′ is a finite-index subgroup of Γ, we know that Γ′ is a superrigid subgroup of G
(see 1.3). Thus, by replacing Γ with Γ′ , we may assume Γ ⊂ B. Let D be the closure of [Γ, Γ].
Because Γ/D is abelian, there is a faithful homomorphism α : Γ/D → T , for some compact torus
T ⊂ GLn (R). We may think of α as a representation of Γ that is trivial on D. Then, because Γ is
superrigid, we know that α virtually extends to a homomorphism σ : G → T . Of course [G, G]σ = e,
because T is abelian. Thus, because α agrees with σ on a finite-index subgroup of Γ, we conclude
that D, the kernel of α, contains a finite-index subgroup of [G, G] ∩ Γ.

3.9. Lemma. Let K and Γ be closed subgroups of a simply connected, solvable Lie group G, such
that K is connected and normal in G, K ∩ Γ = e, KΓ is closed, and AdG KΓ = Ad G. Then there
is a semidirect-product decomposition G = A ⋊ B with K ⊂ A and Γ ⊂ B.
Proof. By induction on the derived length of K, we may assume K is abelian, so AdG K is unipotent
(see 2.14). Then, because AdG KΓ = Ad G, we know that AdG Γ contains a maximal compact torus
of Ad G. So Lem. 2.4 implies that Γ has a syndetic hull X in G. Thus, by replacing Γ with X, we
may assume Γ is connected.
   Let H = {g ∈ G | AdG g ∈ AdG Γ}. Because AdG Γ contains a maximal compact torus of Ad G,
we know that H is connected (see 2.11). For much the same reason, K ∩ H is connected (see 2.15).
   We claim that G = KH. Given g ∈ G, because Ad G = AdG KΓ, we see, from Lem. 2.8, that
AdG g = k′ h′ , for some k′ ∈ AdG K and h′ ∈ AdG Γ. But, because AdG K is unipotent, we have
AdG K = AdG K (see 2.13), so there is some k ∈ K with AdG k = k′ . Then AdG (k−1 g) = h′ ∈
AdG Γ, so, from the definition of H, we have k−1 g ∈ H.
   From the preceding paragraph, we see that, by replacing K with K ∩ H, we may assume G = H.
Therefore, AdG Γ = Ad G, so [G, G] ⊂ Γ (see 2.5(2)). Thus, there is no harm in modding out
[G, G], so we may assume G is abelian. In this case, it is easy to obtain the desired conclusion.
