                                             ABSTRACT. We classify the finite dimensional indecomposable sl(m/n)-modules with at least a
                                             typical or singly atypical primitive weight. We do this classification not only for weight modules, but
                                             also for generalized weight modules. We obtain that such a generalized weight module is simply a
                                             module obtained by “linking” sub-quotient modules of generalized Kac-modules. By applying our
                                             results to sl(m/1), we have in fact completely classified all finite dimensional sl(m/1)-modules.

                                             I. INTRODUCTION
                                                   Because finite dimensional indecomposable modules over Lie superalgebras are not always simple,
                                             the representation theory of Lie superalgebras is more complicated than that of Lie algebras. Kac
                                             in Ref. 1 defined the induced modules V (Λ) for integral dominant weights Λ, which are referred to
                                             as Kac-modules by Van der Jeugt et al in Ref. 2. Kac divided the Kac-modules into two categories:
                                             typical or atypical according as they are simple or not, he also gave a necessary and sufficient condition
                                             for V (Λ) to be simple. Ref. 2 gave a character formula for singly atypical simple sl(m/n)-modules.
                                             Hughes et al in Ref. 3 achieved much progress on the classification of composition factors of Kac-
                                             modules. However, the structure of a Kac-module is in general still an unsolved problem. More
                                             generally, the problem of classifying finite dimensional indecomposable modules, posted in Ref. 1,
                                             remains open.

                                                   We made a start in Ref. 4, by giving a complete classification of finite dimensional sl(2/1)-
                                             modules. In this paper, we generalize the results to sl(m/n). More precisely, we classify all finite
                                             dimensional sl(m/n)-modules with at least a typical or singly atypical primitive weight. It may be
                                             worth mentioning that although our results here are similar to those in Ref. 4, the proofs are more
                                             interesting, more technical, and also more complicated since Lemma 2.6 in Ref. 4 which was crucial

in the proof of that paper, is no longer valid for general sl(m/n).

   By introducing the weight diagram, we are able to obtain Theorem 2.9, a crucial preliminary
result in our classification. Then in Sect. III, by classifying the weight diagram, we obtain our main
result of this section in Theorem 3.8, so that we have a clear picture of a module. In Sect. IV, by
looking deep into generalized weight modules, we can understand these modules better. Then by a
strict and complete proof, we find out in Theorem 4.9 that such a module is nothing but a module
obtained by “linking” some sub-quotient modules of generalized Kac-modules.

   By applying our results to sl(m/1), we have efficiently classified all finite dimensional sl(m/1)-
modules.
   We would like to point out that it may be possible to use our method to classify general inde-
composable modules as long as we have a better understanding of the structure of a Kac-module in
general.




II. THE LIE SUPERALGEBRA sl(m/n) AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS

   Let G denote the space sl(m + 1/n + 1) consisting of (m + n + 2) × (m + n + 2) matrices x = (A
                                                                                                C
                                                                                                       B ),
                                                                                                       D
where A ∈ M(m+1)×(m+1) , B ∈ M(m+1)×(n+1) , C ∈ M(n+1)×(m+1) , and D ∈ M(n+1)×(n+1) , satisfying
the zero supertrace condition str(x) = tr(A) − tr(D) = 0. Here, Mp×q denotes the space of all
p × q complex matrices. Let G0̄ = {(A 0             0
                                    0 D )}, G1̄ = {(C
                                                          B )},
                                                          0       then G = G0̄ ⊕ G1̄ is a ZZ 2 (=ZZ/2ZZ)
graded space over C with even part G0̄ and odd part G1̄ . G is a Lie superalgebra with respect to
the bracket relation defined in the above matrix representation by [x, y] = xy − (−1)ab yx, for x ∈ Ga ,
y ∈ Gb , a, b ∈ ZZ 2 . G0̄ is a Lie algebra isomorphic to sl(m + 1) ⊕ C ⊕ sl(n + 1). Let G+1 = {(00   B )},
                                                                                                      0

G−1 = {(0C   0 )}.
             0       Then G has a ZZ 2 -consistent ZZ-grading G = G−1 ⊕ G0 ⊕ G+1 , G0̄ = G0 and
G1̄ = G−1 ⊕ G+1 .

   A Cartan subalgebra H of G has dimension (m + n + 1) and consists of diagonal (m + n + 2)× (m +
n + 2) matrices of zero supertrace, with basis {hi = Em+i+1,m+i+1 − Em+i+2,m+i+2 | i 6= 0, −m ≤ i ≤
n}∪{h0 = Em+1,m+1 +Em+2,m+2 }, where Eij is the matrix with 1 in (i, j)-entry and 0 otherwise. The
weight space H ∗ is the dual space of H with basis consisting of the simple roots {αi | − m ≤ i ≤ n}
such that the Chevalley generators are {ei = Em+i+1,m+i+2 , fi = Em+i+2,m+i+1 | − m ≤ i ≤ n}, and

       ∆+ = {αij = Σjk=i αk | − m ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n},
       ∆+                                              +
        0 = {αij | − m ≤ i ≤ j < 0 or 0 < i ≤ j ≤ n}, ∆1 = {αij | − m ≤ i ≤ 0 ≤ j ≤ n},

are respectively the sets of positive roots, positive even roots and positive odd roots. For αij ∈∆+ ,
eij =Em+i+1,m+j+1 , fij = Em+j+1,m+i+1 are the generators of the root spaces Gαij , G−αij respectively.

                                                   2
Let (., .) be the inner products in H ∗ such that (αi , αj ) = 2 if i = j < 0; = −2 if i = j > 0; = 0 if
i = j = 0; = −1 if |i − j| = 1 and i, j ≤ 0; = 1 if |i − j| = 1 and i, j ≥ 0; and = 0 if |i − j| ≥ 2.
Define ρ0 = 21 Σ          α, ρ1 = 12 Σ          α and ρ = ρ0 − ρ1 . We give a well order in H ∗ : for λ, µ ∈ H ∗ ,
                   α∈∆+
                      0
                                         α∈∆+
                                            1

λ > µ ⇔ λ − µ = Σni=−m ai αi such that for the first ai 6= 0, we have ai > 0.

   Now let Λ be an integral dominant weight over G, i.e., Λ(hi ) ∈ ZZ + if i 6= 0. Let V 0 (Λ) be
the simple highest weight G0 -modules with the highest weight Λ. As in Ref. 4, we first give some
definitions and preliminary results.

Definition 2.1. Extend V 0 (Λ) to a G0 ⊕ G1 -module by requiring G1 V 0 (Λ) = 0, and define Kac-module
to be the induced module V (Λ) = IndG       0                          0    ∼             0
                                    G0 ⊕G1 V (Λ) = U (G) ⊗U (G0 ⊕G1 ) V (Λ) = U (G−1 ) ⊗ V (Λ).

Similarly, one can define the anti-Kac-module V ∗ (−Λ) with the lowest weight −Λ in the obvious way,
starting from the lowest weight G0 -module V∗0 (−Λ) with the lowest weight −Λ.

   It follows that any highest weight module with highest weight Λ is a quotient of V (Λ). We will
denote V (Λ) the simple highest weight module with highest weight Λ.

Definition 2.2. Let Λ be integral dominant. Λ, V (Λ), V (Λ) are called typical if there does not exist
                                                              j
an odd root αij ∈ ∆+                            0
                   1 such that (Λ + ρ, αij ) = Σk=i Λ(hk ) − Σk=1 Λ(hk ) − i − j = 0, otherwise they

are called atypical. They are called singly atypical if there exists exactly one such αij (in this case,
αij is called an atypical root of Λ), otherwise they are called multiply atypical (see Refs. 1, 2 and 3).
They are called anti-typical, singly (multiply) anti-atypical if −Λ is typical, singly (multiply) atypical
respectively.

Definition 2.3. A weight vector vλ 6= 0 in a module V is called primitive (Ref. 5, §9.3) if there exists
a submodule U such that vλ 6∈ U but G+ vλ ⊂ U . If U = 0, i.e., G+ vλ = 0, then vλ is called strongly
primitive. Correspondingly, λ is called primitive, or strongly primitive. Denote by PV the set of
primitive weights of V . Similarly, one can define anti-primitive vectors and weights by replacing G+
by G− in the definition.

   In this paper, (anti-) primitive vectors are restricted to be those which are G0 -strongly (anti-)
primitive and which generate indecomposable submodules; different primitive vectors always means
they generate different submodules.

   In this paper, we will only consider those finite dimensional indecomposable modules with a
condition that there exists at least a primitive weight of typical or singly atypical type (note that
such condition does not necessarily imply that all primitive weights are typical or singly atypical, we
will prove this implication in Theorem 2.9). As H does not always act diagonally on a G-module, in
Sects. II and III, we will first consider weight modules V , i.e., V admits a weight space decomposition:


                                                             3
V = ⊕λ∈H ∗ Vλ , where Vλ = {v ∈ V | hv = λ(h)v, for h ∈ H}. (In Ref. 4, V is called a module with
diagonal Cartan subalgebra.) Then in Sect. IV, we will extend our results to generalized weight
modules.
Lemma 2.4. (1) V (Λ) is simple ⇔ Λ is typical.
(2) Suppose V (Λ) is not simple, then (i) if Λ is singly atypical, V (Λ) has two composition factors:
one is V (Λ), the other we will denote by V (Λ− ); (ii) if Λ is multiply atypical, all primitive weights of
V (Λ) are multiply atypical.

Proof. (1) See Ref. 1. (2)(i) See Refs. 2 and 3. (ii) (See Ref. 3) If Λ is multiply atypical, then the
bottom composition factor of V (Λ) is the only simple submodule of V (Λ), and its highest weight is
multiply atypical. By (i), a highest weight module of singly atypical type (which has at most two
composition factors) does not contain such a submodule. Thus a simple highest weight module of
singly atypical type cannot be a composition factor of V (Λ).

Remark 2.5. If Λ is singly atypical, by introducing in Ref. 3 the atypicality matrix A(Λ), an (m +
1) × (n + 1) matrix with (m + i + 1, j + 1)-entry being A(Λ)ij = (Λ + ρ, αij ), and the southwest chain
of A(Λ), one can obtain Λ− by subtracting from Λ those αij sitting on the chain. This can be simply
done as follows: choose Λ0 = Λ, Λ1 = Λ0 − αij , where αij is the atypical root of Λ, i.e., A(Λ0 )ij = 0;
suppose we have chosen Λk = Λk−1 − αij , whose atypicality matrix A(Λk ) is obtained from A(Λk−1 )
by subtracting 1 from (m + i + 1)-th row and adding 1 to (j + 1)-th column, then Λk+1 = Λk − αi′ j ′ ,
where (i′ , j ′ ) 6= (i, j) is the another entry satisfying A(Λk )i′ j ′ = 0; continue this procedure until there
is no more such (i′ j ′ ), then Λk is dominant and Λ− = Λk .

   Suppose Λ is singly atypical. We will use the following notations through the paper.

Definition 2.6. (1) Let Λ− denote the weight defined by Lemma 2.4. Suppose vΛ , vΛ− ∈ V (Λ) are the
primitive vectors, then there exists g ∈ G−1 U (G− ) such that gvΛ = vΛ− . Fix such a g and denote it
    −
by gΛ .
(2) Let Λlow denote the lowest weight in V (Λ).
(3) Let Λ+ denote the highest weight of the anti-Kac-module V ∗ (Λlow ). (It follows that Λlow is the
lowest weight of the Kac-module V (Λ+ ).)
(4) In anti-Kac-module V ∗ (Λlow ), where Λlow is a singly anti-atypical lowest weight, similar to Lemma
2.4(2.i), there are 2 primitive vectors vΛ , vΛ+ in V ∗ (Λlow ). By decomposing the enveloping algebra
U (G) = U (G− )U (G+1 )U (G+
                           0 ), and by noting that vΛ+ is the highest weight vector in V ∗ (Λ), there
                                                                             +
exists g ∈ G+1 U (G+1 ) such that gvΛ = vΛ+ . Fix such a g and denote it by gΛ .

   By the above definition, we see from Refs. 2 and 3 that Λ = (Λ+ )− = (Λ− )+ and we can compute


                                                       4
Λ+ as in Remark 2.5 by defining the northeast chain of A(Λ) and adding to Λ those αij sitting on
the chain, so that Λ+ is the last Λk = Λk−1 + αi′ j ′ . Thus, for a singly atypical weight Λ, we can
define inductively {Λ(i) | i ∈ ZZ} by Λ(0) = Λ, Λ(−i) = (Λ(−i+1) )− , Λ(i) = (Λ(i−1) )+ , i > 0. We have
(Λ(k) )+ = Λ(k+1) for k ∈ ZZ. For each Λ, denote φΛ = {Λ(i) | i ∈ ZZ}, and for i, j ∈ ZZ, i ≤ j, denote
 (ij)
φΛ      = {Λ(k) | i ≤ k ≤ j}.

     In the following, we will see a module is uniquely determined, up to an isomorphism, by the
relationship between its primitive vectors. We define a diagram to express the structure of a module
V , where two primitive vectors vλ , vµ are linked by a line with an arrow:

              (i) vλ → vµ ⇔ vµ ∈ G−1 U (G− )vλ and (ii) vλ ← vµ ⇔ vλ ∈ G+1 U (G+1 )vµ .                  (2.1)

It follows that a primitive vector vλ can be linked by 4 ways: → vλ , ← vλ , vλ →, vλ ←.

Definition 2.7. For a module V , let WV be a set of primitive vectors of V corresponding to a
composition series. We can associate WV with a diagram defined by (2.1) for vλ , vµ ∈ WV . We call
this diagram the weight diagram of V , and denote it again by WV .

     From this definition, we see that the weight diagram depends on the choices of primitive vectors:
a module V may correspond to more than one weight diagrams. However, a weight diagram WV does
determine the structure of V as we will see later. When there is no confusion, we sometimes may use
V to mean its diagram or vice versa.

Definition 2.8 A cyclic module X(Λ) is a module generated by a primitive vector vΛ .

Theorem 2.9. Suppose V is an indecomposable module with a primitive weight Λ and a primitive
vector vΛ . We have
(1) If Λ is typical, then V = V (Λ).
(2) If Λ is multiply atypical, then all primitive weights are multiply atypical.
                                                                                               (ij)
(3) If Λ is singly atypical, then all the primitive weights are singly atypical and PV = φΛ           for some
i ≤ 0 ≤ j.
(4) For any choice of WV , WV must be connected, i.e., for any u, v ∈ WV , there exist u0 = u, u1 , .., uk =
v ∈ WV for some k such that ui is linked to ui+1 by a line with an arrow for i = 0, ..., k − 1.

Proof. Take a composition series: 0 = V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ ... ⊂ Vn = V . We will prove the result by induction
on n. If n ≤ 2, by Lemma 2.4, we have the result. Now suppose n ≥ 3. We first prove Statement
(A): All primitive weights must have the same type: typical, singly atypical or multiply atypical,
and WV must be connected. Case (a): V /V1 is decomposable. Decompose it into a direct sum of
indecomposable submodules: V /V1 = ⊕ki=1 Vi′ /V1 , then each Vi′ ⊃ V1 must be indecomposable (if
Vi′ = Vi′′ ⊕ V1 , we would then write V as a disjoint sum Vi′′ ⊕ (Σj6=i Vj′ ) ), and by inductive assumption,

                                                     5
for all i, all primitive weights of Vi′ , which contains V1 , have the same type and WVi′ is connected,
and thus, all primitive weights of V have the same type as that of V1 and WV is connected. Case
(b): V /V1 is indecomposable. By inductive assumption, all primitive weights in V /V1 are of the same
type and WV /V1 is connected. This means that (n − 1) of n primitive weights of V are of the same
type. If V1 is the only simple submodule of V , then Vn−1 is also indecomposable, and so by inductive
assumption, primitive weights of Vn−1 have the same type and WVn−1 is connected; or else, if V has
another simple submodule V1′ , then again by inductive assumption, primitive weights of V /V1′ have
the same type and WV /V1′ is connected. In either aspect, we can find another primitive vector of V
linking to, and having the same type with, the primitive vector of V1 . Therefore all primitive weights
of V have the same type and WV is connected. This proves Statement (A), which implies (2)&(4).

   Now (1) can be proved as above by induction on n. To complete the proof of (3), by Statement
(A), we see that all primitive weights are now singly atypical. We divide the proof into three steps:
Step (i): Suppose V is cyclic. Take U1 = V /V1 and take U2 = V2 if V1 is the only simple submodule
of V , or else, U2 = V /V1′ if V1′ is another simple submodule V1′ of V . Then in either case, U1 and U2
                                                          (ij)        (i′ j ′ )
are both cyclic. By inductive assumption, PU1 = φλ , PU2 = φµ                     for some λ, µ, and PV is their
union. As they are not disjoint, and Λ is at least in one of them. We see that PV has the required
form. Step (ii): For a primitive weight λ, let V (λ) be the submodule generated by primitive vectors
with weights in φλ . By Step (i), PV (λ) ⊂ φλ . For any two weights λ, µ, φλ and φµ are either the
same set or they are disjoint, thus different V (λ) are disjoint. Since V , being a disjoint sum of V (λ) , is
indecomposable, we must have V = V (Λ) . Step (iii): Suppose Λ(k) 6∈ PV but Λ(i) , Λ(j) ∈ PV for some
i < k < j. Let W1 and W2 be submodules generated by primitive vectors with weight Λ(r) such that
r > k and r < k respectively. Then V = W1 ⊕ W2 , a contradiction with that V is indecomposable.
Thus we have (3).

Remark 2.10. (1) If the weight diagram WV is connected, it is not necessary that V is indecomposable
(see Remark 3.7). However, if V is decomposable, we can always choose some suitable primitive vectors
such that WV is not connected.
(2) vµ ∈ U (G)vλ does not mean that vµ is linked to vλ as we will see in Lemma 3.5(1.v).




III. INDECOMPOSABLE WEIGHT MODULES
   Now we can classify indecomposable modules V with a primitive weight Λ of typical or singly
atypical type. We do this by classifying the weight diagram. If Λ is typical, then by Theorem 2.9, V
is simply V (Λ). Thus, from now on, we suppose Λ is singly atypical. Then, all primitive weights are


                                                      6
singly atypical (again by Theorem 2.9).

Lemma 3.1. For any primitive vector vλ , there exists at most one primitive vectors vµ such that µ < λ
and vµ ∈ U (G)vλ (or µ > λ and vµ ∈ U (G)vλ ).

Proof. Suppose conversely there exists a cyclic module V1 = U (G)vλ of the lowest dimension such
that there are 2 primitive vectors vµ , vσ ∈ V1 with, say, µ, σ < λ. By Theorem 2.9(3), µ, σ ≤ λ− . If
there is a primitive vector vδ ∈ V1 such that δ > λ (and then δ ≥ λ+ ), then by our choice of V1 being
lowest dimensional, V1′ = U (G)vδ does not have more than one primitive weight δ1 < δ. Hence, by
Theorem 2.9(3), if δ1 < δ is a primitive weight of V1′ , then δ1 = δ− > λ− ≥ µ, σ. Thus, if we let V2
be the module generated by {vδ | δ > λ, vδ ∈ V1 primitive}, then µ, σ are not primitive weights in V2 ,
so vµ , vσ are still primitive in V3 = V1 /V2 . Since V3 is also a cyclic module, by our choice of V1 , we
must have V2 = 0, i.e., V1 is a highest weight module, but by Lemma 2.4(2.i), V1 cannot contain 2
primitive weights µ, σ. Thus we obtain a contradiction.

Corollary 3.2. WV does not contain (1) u → v → w, (2) u→v
                                                       →w , (3) u ← v ← w, or (4)
                                                                                           u← w.
                                                                                           v←

Proof. This follows immediately from Lemma 3.1 (say VW contains (1) or (2), then v, w ∈ U (G)u and
their weights are less than the weight of v).

Corollary 3.3. (1) If vλ → vµ or vλ ← vµ , then λ = µ+ . (2) PU (G)vλ ⊂ {λ+ , λ, λ− }.

Proof. (1) Say, vλ → vµ . Let V1 = U (G)vλ . By Theorem 2.9(3), if µ 6= λ− , then µ ≤ λ(−2) , and λ−
must also be a primitive weight of V1 . This contradicts Lemma 3.1. (2) follows from (1) and Lemma
3.1.

Lemma 3.4. If (1) vΛ+ ← vΛ
                      → uΛ or (2)
                                    vΛ → v
                                    uΛ ← Λ−     is a part of the diagram, then WV must contain X4 (Λ):
     ← vΛ → v
vΛ + → u Λ ← Λ− .

Proof. Suppose conversely V1 = U (G)vΛ is cyclic with the lowest dimension such that its weight
diagram contains, say, (2), but does not contain X4 (Λ). By Lemma 2.4(2.i), vΛ is not strongly
primitive, i.e., there exists vΛ+ such that vΛ+ ← vΛ . By Corollary 3.2, we do not have a primitive
vector x such that x ← vΛ+ ← vΛ , so vΛ+ must be strongly primitive. Let V2 = U (G)vΛ+ . If uΛ 6∈ V2 ,
then the weight diagram of V1 /V2 contains      vΛ → v     which violates the choice of V1 being of lowest
                                                u Λ ← Λ−

dimension. Thus uΛ ∈ V2 , i.e., uΛ ∈ G−1 U (G−1 )vΛ+ , i.e., vΛ+ → uΛ , a contradiction.

Lemma 3.5. If V = X(Λ) is cyclic, then
(1) WV is one of (i) vΛ , (ii) vΛ+ ← vΛ , (iii) vΛ → vΛ− , (iv) vΛ+ ← vΛ → vΛ− , or (v) X4 (Λ). X4 (Λ) is
the only cyclic module containing a primitive vector which is not linked by the generator vΛ .
(2) V is uniquely (up to isomorphisms) determined by its diagram.



                                                     7
Proof. (1) If vΛ is not linked to any primitive vector on one side, then V is a quotient of Kac- (or
anti-Kac-) module, and we have one of (i), (ii) or (iii). Suppose now vΛ is linked to primitive vectors
on both sides, then WV contains (iv). If it is not (iv), then there is another primitive vector u,
by Lemma 3.1, it must have weight Λ (and we denote uΛ = u). Since both modules V /U (G)vΛ+ ,
V /U (G)vΛ− are Kac- or anti-Kac- modules, we must have uΛ ∈ U (G)vΛ+ and uΛ ∈ U (G)vΛ− , i.e.,
vΛ+ and vΛ− are both linked to uΛ with an arrow pointed to uΛ . By Corollary 3.2, u = uΛ is unique,
i.e., we have (v). The statement about X4 (Λ) is clearly true.
         + −                                                                +              −
(2) Let gΛ , gΛ be as in Definition 2.6, if necessary, by replacing vΛ+ by gΛ vΛ , vΛ− by gΛ vΛ , we can
               +             −
suppose vΛ+ = gΛ vΛ , vΛ− = gΛ vΛ . This uniquely determines V in the first 4 cases. Suppose now V
                            −            +                                                +
is (v), we can choose uΛ = gΛ + vΛ+ and gΛ− vΛ− must be a nonzero multiple of uΛ , i.e., gΛ− vΛ− = xuΛ


for some 0 6= x ∈ C . Suppose V ′ is another module with weight diagram (v) (denote its corresponding
                                                                  + ′         ′
primitive vectors by the same notation with a prime) and suppose gΛ − vΛ− = yuΛ for some 0 6= y ∈ C ,


y 6= x. Form a direct sum V ⊕ V ′ and let V ′′ be its submodule generated by vΛ
                                                                              ′′ = v + v ′ . Then V ′′ is
                                                                                    Λ   Λ
                                                  ′′ = v + + v ′ , v ′′ = v − + v ′ , u′′ = u + u′
indecomposable, which contains primitive vectors vΛ +   Λ     Λ+    Λ−     Λ     Λ−    Λ     Λ   Λ

and u′′′         ′
     Λ = xuΛ + yuΛ . This contradicts (1). (We will see from (4.11) that x = −1.)

   In the following, to be consistent, we use the same notations as in Ref. 4.

Theorem 3.6. (1) WV must be one of the following: (i) X4 (Λ),
(ii)(a) X5a (Λ, n) : vΛ → v1 ← v2 → ... (ended by vn−1 → vn , or vn−1 ← vn if n is odd or even),
(b) X5b (Λ, n) : vΛ ← v1 → v2 ← ... (ended by vn−1 ← vn or vn−1 → vn if n is odd or even),
where vi has weight Λ(−i) .
(2) V is uniquely determined up to isomorphisms by WV .

Proof. For (2), Lemma 3.5(2) tells that X4 (Λ) determines V . As in the proof of Lemma 3.5(2),
X5a (Λ, n), X5b (Λ, n) also uniquely determine V . In fact, we can choose vi inductively, such that
                  +                           −
v0 = vΛ , vi−1 = gΛ (−i) vi if vi−1 ← vi and gΛ(−i+1) vi−1 = vi if vi−1 → vi .


(1) (cf. proof of Theorem 4.9(2.ii).) If V has a submodule corresponds to (i), denote it by V1 ;
otherwise, let V1 be a maximal submodule whose diagram is (ii)(a) or (ii)(b). If V has more primitive
vectors, choose B to be its other primitive vectors such that Σv∈B dim(V1 ∩ U (G)v) is minimum. If B
is not empty, by Theorem 2.9(4), there exists v ∈ B linking to V1 . (i) If V1 = X4 (Λ). By Corollary
3.2, the only possible links are: (a) vΛ+ ← v, (b) v → vΛ− , (c) vΛ+ ← v → vΛ− , (d) v → uΛ , (e)
uΛ ← v. For the first three cases, v has weight Λ. Say, we have (c). We can choose v such that
       +        −
vΛ+ = gΛ v and gΛ v = xvΛ− , for some x 6= 0. Apply Lemma 3.5(2) to U (G)v, whose diagram is
X4 (Λ), we must have x = 1. Thus if we let v ′ = v − vΛ , then V1 ∩ U (G)v ′ = 0. By replacing v by v ′
in B, we get a contradiction with the choice of B. Similarly, for other cases, we can also choose some


                                                       8
primitive vector v ′′ ∈ V1 such that if we replace v by v − v ′′ we obtain a contradiction with the choice
of B. Therefore, B is empty, and V = X4 (Λ). (ii) As V1 is maximal, by Lemma 3.4 and Corollary
3.2, v can not be linked to vΛ or vn . Also by Corollary 3.2, v can not be linked to a vector v2i of
X5a (Λ, n), or v2i−1 of X5b (Λ, n). On the other hand, if v is linked to a vector v2i−1 ∈ X5a (Λ, n) or
v2i ∈ X5b (Λ, n), then v must be linked to that vector with an arrow pointed to it. Then as in (i), by
replacing v by v − v ′′ for some v ′′ ∈ V1 , we can get a contradiction. Thus again, B is empty and we
have (ii).

Remark 3.7. Diagrams such as u←v     v→
                              ←w and w→ u can exist, but they correspond to decomposable modules:

by replacing w by w − v, we see that w is not linked to u, v (see Remark 2.10).

   It is not difficult to construct X5a (Λ, n), X5b (Λ, n) as follows: in the module V ∗ ((Λ− )low ))⊕V (Λ− ),
                                ′ , v ′′ →, “joining” two primitive vectors v ′ , v ′′ into one, by
whose diagram has two parts: ← vΛ −  Λ−                                      Λ−    Λ−
               ′ + v ′′ , we obtain X (Λ, 3) = U (G)v − . Now X (Λ(−2i) , 3) has diagram v ′
letting vΛ− = vΛ                                                                                 ←
                 −  Λ−               5b              Λ         5b                         Λ(−2i)
             ′′
vΛ(−2i−1) → vΛ                                                       ′         ′′
                (−2i−2) . By taking a quotient module, by “merging” vΛ(−2i) , vΛ(−2i) into one, we obtain

                                                   ′
X5b (Λ, 2n) = ⊕ni=0 X5b (Λ(−2i) , 3)/ ⊕ni=1 U (G)(vΛ          ′′
                                                     (−2i) − vΛ(−2i) ) . Modules X5a (Λ, n), X5b (Λ, 2n + 1) can


be realized as subquotients of X5b (Λ, k) for some k. To construct X4 (Λ), form an induced module
Vb (Λ) = IndG   0                      0    ∼                        0
            G0 V (Λ) = U (G) ⊗U (G0 ) V (Λ) = U (G−1 ) ⊗ U (G+1 ) ⊗ V (Λ). (Note that this module

is in general decomposable, therefore not cyclic. However a cyclic module can be realized as its
quotient module.) We are not going to realize X4 (Λ) to be a quotient module of Vb (Λ), but as a
submodule of Vb (Λ+ − 2ρ1 ): let vΛ+ −2ρ1 be the highest weight vector in G0 -module V 0 (Λ+ − 2ρ1 ),
then vΛ+ = gvΛ+ −2ρ1 (where g is the highest root vector in U (G+1 ) ) is a strongly primitive vector
with weight Λ+ , which generates Kac-module V (Λ+ ). It is clear that there must exist a primitive
vector vΛ in Vb (Λ+ − 2ρ1 ) such that vΛ+ ← vΛ . By Lemma 3.4 and Theorem 3.6, vΛ generates a
module corresponding to X4 (Λ) (see also (4.11)).

   We see that just as an anti-Kac-module is isomorphic to a Kac-module, X5b (Λ, 2n+1) is isomorphic
to X5a (Σ, 2n + 1) for some Σ (in fact, (Σ(−2n−1) )low = −Λ). To see that X4 (Λ), X5a (Λ, n), X5b (Λ, n)
are indecomposable: suppose V = V1 ⊕ V2 is a disjoint sum, then each simple submodule must be
contained in V1 or V2 , and then we can obtain that all primitive vectors must be in one, say, V1 , and
V = V1 . Now we can conclude the following

Theorem 3.8.       {V (Λ) | Λ typical} ∪ {X4 (Λ), X5a (Λ, n), X5b (Λ, 2n) | n ∈ ZZ + \{0} } is the complete
set of indecomposable modules with at least a primitive weight of typical or singly atypical type.

Proof. It remains to prove there is no isomorphism between each other. This can be seen by comparing
number of simple submodules and number of composition factors.


                                                       9
IV. INDECOMPOSABLE GENERALIZED WEIGHT MODULES
   Now suppose V is an indecomposable G-module such that H acts on V not necessarily diagonally.
Such a module is called a generalized weight module (in Ref. 4, it is called a module with nondiagonal
Cartan subalgebra, or nondiagonal module). In this case, we do not have weight space decomposition.
However, by the properties of semi-simple Lie algebras, we see that V must be H0 -diagonal, where H0
is the Cartan subalgebra of G′0 (where, here and after, G′0 is the subalgebra of G0 with co-dimension
1 such that h0 6∈ G′0 ) with a basis {hi | i 6= 0}. We have

              V = ⊕λ∈H ∗ Vλ , where Vλ = {v ∈ V | (h − λ(h))n v = 0 for some n ∈ ZZ + }.                 (4.1)

Vλ are called generalized weight spaces. With this decomposition, we have, similar to Sect. II, notions
of generalized (strongly) (anti-) primitive vectors (weights), generalized weight diagram, etc. In the
following, we often omit the word generalized if there is no confusion.

   We can take a composition series

                                       0 = V (0) ⊂ V (1) ⊂ ... ⊂ V (n) = V,                              (4.2)

such that each V (i) is a direct sum of subspaces

                                                    (i)                        (i)
                              V (i) = V (i−1) ⊕ V         , where V                  is a G′0 -module.   (4.3)

              (i)                                                                                  (i)
Then each V         has a unique, up to scalars, generalized primitive vector vλi with weight λi . Sometimes,
we can just choose (4.2) to be any series of submodules such that (4.3) holds.

Definition 4.1. For an integral dominant weight Λ, construct an indecomposable module, the general-
ized Kac-module V (Λ, n), n ∈ ZZ + \{0}, as follows: It is a semi-direct sum of n copies of V (Λ), such
that each copy is a G′0 ⊕ G−1 -module, and

                                        (i)                 (i)         (i−1)
                                    h0 vΛ = Λ(h0 )vΛ + vΛ                       , i = 2, ..., n,         (4.4)

        (i)
where vΛ belongs to the i-th copy of V (Λ). As V (Λ) is the induced module, it is easy to check
that V (Λ, n) is well defined as an indecomposable G-module. Similarly, we can define generalized
anti-Kac-module V ∗ (−Λ, n).

   Note that if Λ is singly atypical, then V (Λ, n) has the “zigzag” weight diagram such that

                                              (i)     (i)              (i−1)          (i)
                                          vΛ → vΛ − ,              vΛ          ← vΛ − ,                  (4.5)

                                                                  10
                                                   (0)
for i = n, n − 1, ..., 1 (where we take vΛ = 0).

Remark 4.2. If Λ is typical, V (Λ, n) give us examples that there may exist a primitive vector vΛ such
that it is not linked to any primitive vector, but U (G)vΛ is not simple and that an indecomposable
module may not correspond to a connected weight diagram. Therefore, more care should be taken
when we consider generalized weight modules. We shall see in Lemmas 4.5(2)&4.6(3), that this does
not happen if Λ is singly atypical.

Definition 4.3. Define a partial order on generalized primitive vectors: we say v has higher level than
u or v is on top of u ⇔ u ∈ U (G)v, but v 6∈ U (G)u.

      We see that the generalized primitive vectors of V 0 (Λ, n) = V (Λ, n) are well ordered by this partial
                                                   (n)                                    (1)
order. Now by removing top vector vΛ , removing bottom vector vΛ− , and removing both top and
                        (n)     (1)                                                                                            (n)
bottom vectors vΛ , vΛ− respectively, we obtain three indecomposable modules: V 1 (Λ, n)=U (G)vΛ− ,
                                       (1)                             (n)          (1)
V 2 (Λ, n)=V (Λ, n)/U (G)vΛ− and V 3 (Λ, n − 1)=U (G)vΛ− /U (G)vΛ− . We see that generalized anti-
Kac-module V ∗ ((Λ− )low , n) can be realized as V 3 (Λ, n), a subquotient of generalized Kac-module
V (Λ, n + 1).

Lemma 4.4. Suppose V is a (generalized) highest weight module with highest weight Λ (i.e., V is
generated by a generalized strongly primitive vector vΛ ). (1) If Λ is typical, then V ∼
                                                                                       = V (Λ, n) for
some n. (2) If Λ is singly atypical, then V is a quotient of V (Λ, n) for some n. More precisely,
V = V i (Λ, n), i = 0 or 2.

Proof. First, as U (G) = U (G− )U (H)U (G+ ), we see that V = U (G− )U (H)vΛ does not have weight
> Λ. Let V be as in (4.2). We use induction on n. If n = 1, the result is obvious. Suppose now
n ≥ 2. As V ′ = V /V (1) is still a highest weight module, by inductive assumption, it has the required
form. If Λ is typical, then V ′ = V (Λ, n − 1), and therefore by (4.4), we can inductively choose spaces
    (i)                                                                      (i)
V         in (4.3) as a copy of V (Λ) with the primitive vector vΛ , i = n, n − 1, ..., 2, such that

                                             (i)     (i)   (i−1)
                                      h0 vΛ = Λ(h0 )vΛ + vΛ        + vi for some vi ∈ V (1) ,                                 (4.6)

where, we take vΛ =0 when i = 2. As all vΛ ∈ VΛ , we have vi ∈ VΛ , i.e., vi has weight Λ. By
                (i−1)         (i−1)                                   (i)                              (i−1)
replacing vΛ            by vΛ          + vi (and replacing space V          by U (G−1 )U (G′0 )(vΛ             + vi ) accordingly),
                                                                       (1)
we can suppose vi = 0 if i > 2. If v2 6= 0, denote it by vΛ , then we have (4.4), and thus V = V (Λ, n)
                                                                                                (i)
and the result follows. On the other hand, if v2 = 0, then V ′′ = Σni=2 V                             is a submodule of V and
V = V (1) ⊕ V ′′ , a contradiction with that V is a highest weight module. This proves (1). For (2),
as V ′ has the required form, without loss of generality, say V ′ = V 2 (Λ, n). Then as space, it is the

                                                                 11
                                                                                               (i)
direct sum of (n − 1) copies of V (Λ) plus V (Λ). Now again choose V                                 to be a copy of V (Λ) for
                (2)
i ≥ 3 and V           = V (Λ) (in this case, (4.2) is not a composition series). Now follow the arguments
                                                                     (i)                                                    (i)
exactly as above, we have (4.4) for i >= 3. Take vΛ− to be the other primitive vector in V                                        for
                                                                                        (1)                     (2)
i ≥ 3. Then we have (4.5) for i = n, .., 3. Now we must have V                                ⊂ V ′′′ = U (G)vΛ (otherwise,
       (1)                (i)                                                                                         (1)         (2)
V =V         ⊕ (Σni=2 V         ) is decomposable). It remains to prove V ′′′ , which is now as space V                     ⊕V          ,
is V (Λ) (and then V = V (Λ, n) ). This follows from Lemma 4.5(3) below.

    The following Lemma 4.5 tells that, unlike typical case, for atypical weight Λ, we do not have
indecomposable module whose composition factors are n copies of V (Λ).

Lemma 4.5. (1) Suppose V is a (generalized weight) module whose composition factors are n copies
of V (Λ) with Λ typical or singly atypical, then (i) if V is indecomposable, then either n = 1, or else,
Λ is typical and V = V (Λ, n); (ii) if Λ is singly atypical, then V is the direct sum of n copies of V (Λ)
(and thus, V is a weight module).
(2) If vΛ is a primitive vector with singly atypical weight Λ such that it is not linked to any primitive
vector, then U (G)vΛ is simple.
(3) If V is an indecomposable module with 2 composition factors of singly atypical type, then V is a
Kac- (or anti-Kac-) weight module.

Proof. (1) Let (4.2) be a composition series of V . By induction on n, we see that we only need
to prove the result for n = 2. (i) If Λ is typical, it is easy to see, as in the proof of Lemma 4.4,
                                                                           (i)
V = V (Λ, 2). (ii) Suppose now Λ is singly atypical, let vΛ , i = 1, 2, be the primitive vectors of V
and suppose
                                                       (2)           (2)         (1)
                       h0 v (1) = Λ(h0 )v (1) , h0 vΛ = Λ(h0 )vΛ + avΛ , for some a ∈ C .                                    (4.7)

Note that, in U (G), for G = sl(m/n), using notations in Sect. II, we have
                  Y                       Y                      Y

for some g + ∈ U (G)G+ , where σ = ±1 (this can be proved by ordering eij (fij ) properly in the
products, such that if j − i > j ′ − i′ , or j − i = j ′ − i′ and j > j ′ , then eij (fij ) is placed to the right
(left) of ei′ j ′ (fi′ j ′ resp.); then using induction on m, n). We have

                                                 (2)                  Y                (2)

                                                                −m≤i≤0≤j≤n


(The l.h.s. of the second equality is in the bottom composition factor V (Λ− ) of V (Λ) with weight
Λ − 2ρ1 , any copy of V (Λ) does not have a vector with weight Λ − 2ρ1 ; therefore it is zero in V ). Now

                                                                12
                (2)
apply (4.8) to vΛ , using (4.9) and (4.7), we obtain

            Y                     (2)         X                         Y                                          (1)
    0=                (Λ + ρ, αij )vΛ +                                                   (Λ + ρ, αi′ j ′ )avΛ .           (4.10)
         −m≤i≤0≤n                         −m≤i≤0≤j≤n      −m≤i′ ≤0≤j ′ ≤n, (i′ j ′ )6=(i,j)


However, by Definition 2.2, there is exactly one atypical root, i.e., one pair of (i, j) such that (Λ +
                                                                         (2)              (1)
ρ, αij ) = 0, thus (4.10) forces a = 0. This proves V = U (G)vΛ ⊕ U (G)vΛ = V (Λ) ⊕ V (Λ).
(2) Let V = U (G)vΛ be as in (4.2). If n > 1, using induction, we can suppose V /V (1) is simple, i.e.,
n = 2. By (1), two composition factors can not be the same, but then as in (4.6) (for i = 2) and the
arguments after (4.6), we see that U (G)vΛ is a weight module. As vΛ is not linked to any primitive
vector, by Theorem 2.9, V has to be simple (and so n = 2 does not occur).
(3) The proof is the same as (2).

   Now we have the generalized weight modules V i (Λ, n) and X5a (Λ, n), X5b (Λ, n), whose diagrams
have 2 endpoints (i.e., vectors linked by only one vector). Such diagrams are called lines. We can “join”
and “merge” those modules to form other indecomposable modules just as we did to form X5b (Λ, n)
in Sect. III. In particular, we can define a module X4 (Λ, m, n, x) (m, n ≥ 2, 0 6= x ∈ C ) as follows: let
                                                    (1)        ′(1)
X3 (Λ, m, n) = (V 1 (Λ+ , m) ⊕ V 2 (Λ, n))/U (G)(vΛ − vΛ ) (with obvious meanings of notations) be the
                                                                         (1)                                ′(1)
quotient module (by “merging” the two bottom endpoints vΛ ∈ V 1 (Λ+ , m) and vΛ                                    ∈ V 2 (Λ, n) ).
                                                                                 (m)            ′(n)
Then X4 (Λ, m, n, x) is the submodule of X3 (Λ, n) generated by vΛ                     + xvΛ           (by “joining” the two
top endpoints). By this construction, one sees that X4 (Λ, m, n, x) is indecomposable, generated by
a primitive vector, therefore cyclic. Its diagram is a circle, i.e., no endpoints. It is interesting to see
that X4 (Λ) can be realized as
                                           X4 (Λ) = X4 (Λ, 2, 2, −1).                                                      (4.11)

This is because: if x = −1, when we “join” the top endpoints, the second term of the r.h.s. of (4.4) is
lost, and so h0 becomes acting diagonally. We point out that only with a circle, an x makes difference:
just as in Sect. III, we can choose suitable primitive vectors starting from a vector vλ1 of the weight
diagram (we always choose vλ1 to be an endpoint if it is a line), and follow the links between vectors,
such that if vλ → vµ , then gλ− vλ = vµ and if vλ ← vµ , then vλ = gµ+ vµ . But within a circle, the
last vector vλn we chose is linked to the first one and in this case, say, vλn ← vλ1 , we may have
gλ+1 vλ1 = xvλn for some x ∈ C \{0}. By rescaling vectors, we see that x can be shifted anywhere, but
can not be eliminated if the diagram is a circle.

   It is interesting to see that we can “add” a primitive vector to a circle to break it into a line: in
                                                                               (m)
the above construction, X3 (Λ, m, n) can be obtained by adding vΛ                    to X4 (Λ, m, n, x).



                                                          13
Lemma 4.6. (1) Let V be a cyclic module with a primitive weight Λ of typical or singly atypical type,
then all generalized primitive weights have the same type. Furthermore, V must be (i) V (Λ, n) if Λ
is typical or (ii) a quotient of some X4 (Σ, m, n, x), where Σ = Λ(i) for some i = −1, 0, 1 (and so its
diagram is obtained from X4 (Σ, m, n, x) by removing some vectors from the bottom) if Λ is singly
atypical.
(2) If Λ is singly atypical and V = X(Λ) is cyclic, then PV ∈ {Λ+ , Λ, Λ− }.
(3) If V is an indecomposable module with a singly atypical weight, then WV is connected.

Proof. (1) Take a composition series 0 = V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ ... ⊂ Vk = V . First as in the proof of Theorem
2.9, by induction on k, we can prove all generalized primitive weights have the same type. Now if
k = 1, we clearly have the result. Suppose k ≥ 2. Then V /V1 is still cyclic, by inductive assumption,
it has the required form. Now follows exactly the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 4.4, we
have the result. (2) follows from (1). (3) By (1), diagrams for cyclic modules are connected. If WV is
not connected, two submodules generated by primitive vectors in two disjoint parts are disjoint and
V is their disjoint sum.

                         (i)
       In V (Λ, n), all vΛ− have weight Λ− < Λ, thus, Lemma 3.1 does not hold for generalized weight
                               (i)                       (n)       (i)                (n)
modules; and we have vΛ− ∈ G−1 U (G− )U (H)vΛ , but vΛ− 6∈ G−1 U (G− )vΛ if i < n, thus by (2.1),
 (i)                                          (n)
vΛ− is not linked by the generator vΛ if i < n. However, from the structure of weight diagrams of
cyclic modules in Lemma 3.6, we see that Corollary 3.2 still holds for generalized weight diagrams.
Now similar (but not exactly) to Ref. 4, we define

Definition 4.7. (1) A chain is a triple (C, Λ, x), where Λ is a singly atypical weight, C is a finite set:
C = {v1 , ..., vn }, x ∈ C , such that vi has a weight λi = Λ(k) for some k and there are links with
arrows between elements in C, such that
(i) each element v is linked by at most 2 elements, and in this case, it can only be one of (a) ← v →,
                ← , (d)
(b) → v ←, (c) v→              →v    (accordingly, v is called a top, bottom, left, right, point);
                               ←

(ii) If vi is linked to vj with an arrow pointed to it, then vi is not derived from vj (we say v is derived
from u if there exist v = u0 , u1 , ..., uk = u such that ui+1 is linked to ui with an arrow pointed to it
for i = 0, .., k − 1);
(iii) C is connected;
(iv) if vi is linked to vj from the left, then λi = λ+
                                                     j ;

(v) if vi is a leftmost element, i.e., there is no elements linked to it from left side, then λi = Λ;
(vi) x = 0 ⇔       there are 2 endpoints.
(2) A subchain of (C, Λ, x) is a subset of C together with the weight, the original relationship between
the elements.


                                                           14
(3) An isomorphism between two chains (C, Λ, x) and (C ′ , Λ′ , x′ ) is a bijection C             → C ′ which
preserves weight, linking relationship and x = x′ .
(4) An anti-isomorphism between (C, Λ, x) and (C ′ , Λ′ , x′ ) is a bijection φ : C → C ′ such that (i)
u ← v ⇔ φ(v) → φ(u), and u → v ⇔ φ(v) ← φ(u); (ii) if a rightmost element of C ′ has the weight
λ, then λlow = −Λ; (iii) x = x′ .

Remark 4.8. (1) For a chain (C, Λ, x), we can break it, at top and bottom points, into pieces of
subchains according to the rule: if ← vλ → (or → uλ ←), then we break at the point vλ (or uλ ) into
← vλ′ , vλ′′ → (or → u′λ , u′′λ ←, resp.). Then each piece is corresponding to some V i (Λ(j) , k). If we only
break it at the bottom points, then each piece corresponds to a cyclic module. This gives us a better
understanding of what a chain is.
(2) If a chain is a line, then conditions (ii)&(iv) are unnecessary as (ii) can not happen and we have
a unique way to associate with each vi a weight λi such that (iv) is satisfied.
(3) Examples of non-chains: (a) a diagram such that vv13 →        v1 ←
                                                         ← v2 and v3 → v4 (it violates (ii)); (b) v1 → ← v5
                                                                                                     →← →←


(it violates (iv)).

    We see that the weight diagrams of all indecomposable modules introduced up to now are chains.
Now we can prove the main result of this section.

Theorem 4.9. (1) For any chain (C, Λ, x), there is a unique indecomposable generalized weight
G-module X(C, Λ, x) corresponding to it.
(2) If V is an indecomposable generalized weight module with a primitive weight Λ of typical or singly
atypical type, then (i) V = V (Λ, n) if Λ is typical, or (ii) there exists a unique chain (C, Λ, x), up to
an (anti-) isomorphism, such that V = X(C, Λ, x) if Λ is singly atypical.

Proof. (1) Break the chain as in Remark 4.8, let V ′ be the direct sum of all V i (Λ(j) , k) obtained.
Then for each pair of u′λ , u′′λ , we can “merge” them into one uλ (this is a bottom point) by taking
quotient V ′ /U (G)(u′λ − u′′λ ) and let V ′′ be this quotient module; and for each pair of vλ′ , vλ′′ , we “join”
them into one vλ (this is a top point) by letting vλ = vλ′ + avλ′′ (where a = x if x 6= 0 and vλ is the
last vector to be joined in order to form the circle; or otherwise, a = 1). Now let X(C, Λ, x) be the
submodule of V ′′ generated by all “joined” vectors vλ (all top points). Then we see X(C, Λ, x) is
corresponding to (C, Λ, x). By the statements following (4.11), we see that it is uniquely determined
by (C, Λ, x). To see it is indecomposable, suppose it is a direct sum of submodules V1 ⊕ V2 . If vλ plus
a linear combination of other vectors in C with weight λ belongs to V1 , then by Lemma 4.6(1.ii), all
vectors derived from vλ is in V1 ; as C is connected, all vectors in C must also be in V1 ; thus V2 = 0.
(2)(i) Let V ′ be the submodule generated by {vλ ∈ C | λ singly atypical (if any)}, and let V (λ) be
the submodule generated by {v ∈ C | v has weight λ} if λ is typical. Then by Lemma 4.6(1.i),


                                                       15
V = ⊕{λ                (λ) ⊕ V ′   is a direct sum, thus V = V (Λ) . Now by Lemmas 4.6(1.i)& 4.5(1.i), we have
          typical} V

V = V (Λ, n).
(ii) (cf. proof of Theorem 3.6.(1)) We want to prove Statement (A): For any generalized weight module
V , we can choose WV such that it is a union of pieces of disconnected subdiagrams, each subdiagram
is a chain. Then by Lemma 4.6(3), we have the result. Now let V has a composition series as in
(4.2). If n ≤ 2, (A) follows immediately from Lemma 4.5. Assume now n ≥ 3. By induction, suppose
WV (n−1) satisfies (A). Let v be a primitive vector corresponding to V /V (n−1) . Then v is not derived
by any primitive vector. To understand it better, we prove (A) case by case. Using Corollary 3.2,
we consider all possible cases below. Case (a): If v is not linked to WV (n−1) , then v itself is a piece
of chain. Thus we have (A). Case (b): If v is linked to WV (n−1) only on the right side, then there is
a unique u in a piece of WV (n−1) such that u ← v. Thus, there does not exist u′ such that u′ ← u.
(b.1): If there is v ′ ∈ WV (n−1) such that u ← v ′ , then we can replace v by v − v ′ so that v is now not
linked to WV (n−1) . This becomes (a). (b.2): It remains that u is either a left top endpoint: u → w,
or a right bottom endpoint: w → u. Then we see that v can be added to that piece so that we have
u←v
 →w or w → u ← v, and it is still a chain. Thus we have (A). Case (c): Similar to (b), if v is linked

to WV (n−1) only on the left side, we have (A). Case (d): If v is linked to WV (n−1) on both sides, i.e.,
there are unique u, w ∈ WV (n−1) such that we have Diagram (D.1): u ← v → w. (d.1): If u, w belong
to 2 different pieces of chains, then as in (a) and (b), by a suitable choice of v and rescaling primitive
vectors if necessary, either v can be added to one piece, or we can link 2 pieces through v into one
piece of chain. Thus we have (A). (d.2): Finally suppose u and w are in the same piece of chain.
In this case, suppose v has weight λ, and u = gλ+ v, gλ− v = xw for some x 6= 0. (d.2.1): If there is
v ′ ∈ WV (n−1) such that we have Diagram (D.2): u ← v ′ → w. (d.2.1.i): If x = 1. Replace v by v − v ′ ,
then v is not linked to any one. This becomes (a) and we have (A). (d.2.1.ii): If x 6= 1, by replacing
v by v − v ′ and replacing v ′ by xv − v ′ , when we add v into that piece, from (D.1) and (D.2), we see
that (D.2) is broken into: u ← v ′ , v → w (cf. the statement before Lemma 4.6). Therefore it is still
corresponding to a piece of chain (or 2 pieces of chains if that piece becomes disconnected). Thus
we have (A). (d.2.2): If there exists v ′ ∈ WV (n−1) such that v ′ → w, but not u ← v ′ or there exists
v ′′ ∈ WV (n−1) such that u ← v ′′ but not v ′′ → w, or if both, by replacing v by v − v ′ , or v − v ′′ , or
v − v ′ − v ′′ , we see that (D.1) becomes u ← v or v → w, or v. This becomes (b) or (c) or (a). (d.2.3):
It remains that u is either a right bottom endpoint t → u or a left top endpoint u → t and w is either
a left bottom endpoint w ← x or a right top endpoint x ← w. From (D.1), we see that v can be
added to it so that we have t → u ← v → w ← x or t → u←v→        ←v→          ← v→
                                                       x← w, or u→t w ← x or u→t x← w, and it

is still a chain. Thus we have (A). This completes the proof of Statement (A).

Remark 4.10. By applying the above results to sl(m/1), as all primitive weights of sl(m/1) are typical

or singly atypical, we have efficiently classified all finite dimensional (weight or generalized weight)
sl(m/1)-modules.
