                                             Euler-Poincaré functions and pseudo-coefficients are important tools in har-
                                             monic analysis since they help to single out a given representation in direct
                                             integrals or sums. Given a real reductive group G that admits a compact Car-
                                             tan subgroup, these functions can be attached to a given finite dimensional
                                             representation τ of a maximal compact subgroup K. In [10] a construction
                                             was given in the case when τ extends to the bigger group G. In this paper
                                             we give a new construction for an arbitrary representation τ . Instead, we
                                             put a condition on the group G, namely, that it acts orientation preservingly
                                             on the symmetric space G/K. This condition is satisfied if G is connected
                                             or if it respects a complex structure on G/K. For connected G the existence
                                             of Euler-Poincaré functions is known [4], but this is not always sufficient
                                             for applications since Levi components are not in general connected, even if


                                                                                  1

the ambient group is. After having constructed Euler-Poincaré functions we
compute the orbital integrals of semisimple elements.




1     Notations
We denote Lie groups by upper case roman letters G, H, K, . . . and the cor-
responding real Lie algebras by lower case German letters with index 0, that
is: g0 , h0 , k0 , . . . . The complexified Lie algebras will be denoted by g, h, k, . . . ,
so, for example: g = g0 ⊗R C.
Let G be a real reductive group [13] and fix a maximal compact subgroup K
of G. Fix a Cartan involution θ with fixed point set the maximal compact
subgroup K and let k0 be the Lie algebra of K. The group K acts on g0 via
the adjoint representation and there is a K-stable decomposition g0 = k0 ⊕p0 ,
where p0 is the eigenspace of (the differential of) θ to the eigenvalue −1. Write
g = k ⊕ p for the complexification. This is called the Cartan decomposition.
Fix a symmetric bilinear form B : g0 × g0 → R such that

    • B is invariant, that is B(Ad(g)X, Ad(g)Y ) = B(X, Y ) for all g ∈ G
      and all X, Y ∈ g0 and

    • B is negative definite on k0 and positive definite on its orthocomplement
      p0 = k⊥
            0 ⊂ g0 .


When G is semisimple we can choose B to be the Killing form of g0 .
Let U(g) be the universal enveloping algebra of g, then B gives rise to a
Casimir element C ∈ U(g). For an irreducible admissible representation
(π, Vπ ) the operator C will act on Vπ by a scalar π(C) ∈ C.
Let X denote the quotient manifold G/K. The tangent space at eK identifies
with p0 and the form B gives a K-invariant positive definite inner product
on this space. Translating this by elements of G defines a G-invariant Rie-
mannian metric on X. This makes X the most general globally symmetric
space of the noncompact type [8].

Let Ĝ denote the unitary dual of G, i.e., Ĝ is the set of isomorphism classes
of irreducible unitary representations of G.
The form hX, Y i = −B(X, θ(Y ) is positive definite on g0 and therefore in-
duces a positive definite left invariant top differential form ωL on any closed
subgroup L of G. If L is compact we set
                                          Z
                                 v(L) =      ωL .
                                                L

Let H = AB be a θ-stable Cartan subgroup where A is the connected split
component of H and B is compact. The double use of the letter B here
will not cause any confusion. Then B ⊂ K. Let Φ denote the root system
of (g, h), L
           where g and h are the complexified Lie algebras of G and H. Let
g = h ⊕ α∈Φ gα be the root space decomposition. Let x → xc denote the
complex conjugation on g with respect to the real form g0 = Lie(G). A root
α is called imaginary if αc = −α and it is called real if αc = α. Every root
space gα is one dimensional and has a generator Xα satisfying:
                  [Xα , X−α ] = Yα       with       α(.) = B(Yα , .)
                               B(Xα , X−α ) = 1
and Xαc  = Xαc if α is non-imaginary and Xαc = ±X−α if α is imaginary. An
imaginary root α is called compact if Xαc = −X−α and noncompact otherwise.
Let Φn be the set of noncompact imaginary roots and choose a set Φ+ of
positive roots such that for α ∈ Φ+ nonimaginary we have that αc ∈ Φ+ . Let
W = W (G, H) be the Weyl group of (G, H), that is
                                     normalizer(H)
                           W =                      .
                                     centralizer(H)
Let rkR (G) be the dimension of a maximal R-split torus in G and let ν =
dim G/K − rkR (G). We define the Harish-Chandra constant of G by
                                     +          +      v(T )
                    cG = (−1)|Φn | (2π)|Φ | 2ν/2             |W |.

2    Normalization of Haar measures
Although the results will not depend on normalizations we will need to nor-
malize Haar measures for the computations along the way. First for any
EULER-POINCARÉ FUNCTIONS                                                    4


compact subgroup C ⊂ G we normalize its Haar measure so that it has total
mass one, i.e., vol(C) = 1. Next let H ⊂ G be a reductive subgroup, and
let θH be a Cartan involution on H with fixed point set KH . The same way
as for G itself the form B restricted to the Lie algebra of H induces a Rie-
mannian metric on the manifold XH = H/KH . Let dx denote the volume
element of that metric. We get a Haar measure on H by defining
                      Z             Z Z
                         f (h)dh =           f (xk)dkdx
                       H                  XH       KH

for any continuous function of compact support f on H.
Let P ⊂ G be a parabolic subgroup of G (see [13] 2.2). Let P = MAN be
the Langlands decomposition of P . Then M and A are reductive, so there
Haar measures can be normalized as above. Since G = P K = MANK there
is a unique Haar measure dn on the unipotent radical N such that for any
constant function f of compact support on G it holds:
              Z            Z Z Z Z
                 f (x)dx =              f (mank)dkdndadm.
                G               M   A     N    K
Note that these normalizations coincide for Levi subgroups with the ones
met by Harish-Chandra in ([5] sect. 7).


3     Invariant distributions
In this section we shall throughout assume that G is a real reductive group
of inner type [13]. A distribution T on G, i.e., a continuous linear functional
T : Cc∞ (G) → C is called invariant if for any f ∈ Cc∞ (G) and any y ∈ G it
holds: T (f y ) = T (f ), where f y (x) = f (yxy −1). Examples are:
                                          R
    • orbital integrals: f 7→ Og (f ) = Gg \G f (x−1 gx)dx and

    • traces: f 7→ tr π(f ) for π ∈ Ĝ.

These two examples can each be expressed in terms of the other. Firstly,
Harish-Chandra proved that for any π ∈ Ĝ there exists a conjugation invari-
ant locally integrable function Θπ on G such that for any f ∈ Cc∞ (G)
                                    Z
                         tr π(f ) =   f (x)Θπ (x)dx.

Recall the Weyl integration formula which says that for any integrable func-
tion ϕ on G we have
  Z                 r
                    X                    Z        Z
                               1
       ϕ(x)dx =                                           ϕ(xhx−1 )|det(1 − h|g/hj )|dxdh,

                          |W (G, Hj )|       Hj   G/Hj


where H1 , . . . , Hr is a maximal set of nonconjugate Cartan subgroups in G
and for each Cartan subgroup H we let W (G, H) denote its Weyl group, i.e.,
the quotient of the normalizer of H in G by its centralizer.
An element x of G is called regular if its centralizer is a Cartan subgroup.
The set of regular elements Greg is open and dense in G therefore the integral
above can be taken over Greg only. Letting Hjreg := Hj ∩ Greg we get

                                                                          dim G
Proposition 3.1 Let N be a natural number bigger than                       2

That is, we have expressed the trace distribution in terms of orbital integrals.
In the other direction it is also possible to express semisimple orbital integrals
in terms of traces.
At first let H be a θ-stable Cartan subgroup of G. Let h be its complex
Lie algebra and let Φ = Φ(g, h) be the set of roots. Let x → xc denote
the complex conjugation on g with respect to the real form g0 = LieR (G).
Choose an ordering Φ+ ⊂ Φ and let Φ+   I be the set of positive imaginary
roots. To any root α ∈ Φ let

                                         H → C×

have Ad(h)X = hα X. Now put

 Let H = AT where A is the connected split component and T is compact.
An element at ∈ AT = H is called split regular if the centralizer of a in G
equals the centralizer of A in G. The split regular elements form a dense
open subset containing the regular elements of H. Choose a parabolic P
with split component A, so P has Langlands decomposition P = MAN. For
at ∈ AT = H let

where ρP is the half of the sum of the roots in Φ(P, A), i.e., a2ρP = det(a|n).
We will also write hρP instead of aρP .
For any h ∈ H reg = H ∩ Greg let
                                                                Z

It then follows directly from the definitions that for h ∈ H reg it holds
                                                    ′

where (g/h)+ is the sum of the root spaces attached to positive roots. There
is an extension of this identity to nonregular elements as follows: For h ∈ H
let Gh denote its centralizer in G. Let Φ+ (gh , h) be the set of positive roots
of (gh , h). Let                        Y
                              ̟h =             Yα ,
                                              α∈Φ+ (gh ,h)

then ̟h defines a left invariant differential operator on G.

Proof: This is proven in section 17 of [6].                                           Q.E.D.

Our aim is to express orbital integrals in terms of traces of representations.
By the above lemma it is enough to express ′ Ff (h) it terms of traces of
f when h ∈ H reg . For this let H1 = A1 T1 be another θ-stable Cartan
subgroup of G and let P1 = M1 A1 N1 be a parabolic with split component
A1 . Let K1 = K ∩ M1 . Since G is connected the compact group T1 is
an abelian torus and its unitary dual Tb1 is a lattice. The Weyl group W =
W (M1 , T1 ) acts on Tb1 and tb1 ∈ Tb1 is called regular if its stabilizer W (tb1 ) in W
                                reg
is trivial. The regular set Tb1 modulo the action of W (K1 , T1 ) ⊂ W (M1 , T1 )
parameterizes the discrete series representations of M1 (see [9]). For tb1 ∈ Tb1
Harish-Chandra [7] defined a distribution Θtb1 on G which happens to be the
trace of the discrete series representation πtb1 attached to tb1 when tb1 is regular.
When tb1 is not regular the distribution Θtb1 can be expressed as a linear
combination of traces as follows. Choose an ordering of the roots of (M1 , T1 )
and let Ω be the product of all positive roots. For any w ∈ W we have
wΩ = ǫ(w)Ω for a homomorphism
                       P                  ǫ : W → {±1}. For nonregular tb1 ∈ Tb1
                   1
we get Θtb1 = |W (tb )| w∈W (tb1 ) ǫ(w)Θ′w,tb1 , where Θ′w,tb1 is the character of an

We will write πtb1 for the virtual representation |W (1tb )| w∈Wc ǫ(w)πw,tb1 .

4     Existence of Euler-Poincaré functions
Let G be a real reductive group that admits a compact Cartan. Fix a maximal
compact subgroup K of G and a Cartan T of G which lies inside K. The
group G is called orientation preserving if G acts by orientation preserving
diffeomorphisms on the manifold X = G/K. For example, the group G =
SL2 (R) is orientation preserving but the group P GL2 (R) is not. Recall the
Cartan decomposition g0 = k0 ⊕ p0 . Note that G is orientation preserving if
and only if its maximal compact subgroup K preserves orientations on p0 .

Lemma 4.1 The following holds:

    • Any connected group is orientation preserving.

    • If X carries the structure of a complex manifold which is left stable by
      G, then G is orientation preserving.

Proof: The first is clear. The second follows from the fact that biholomor-
phic maps are orientation preserving.                                Q.E.D.

Let t be the complexified Lie algebra of the Cartan subgroup T . We choose
an ordering of the roots Φ(g, t) of the pair (g, t) [13]. This choice induces a
decomposition p = p− ⊕p+ , where p± is the sum of the positive/negative root
spaces which lie in p. As usual denote by ρ the half sum of the positive roots.
EULER-POINCARÉ FUNCTIONS                                                    9


The chosen ordering induces an ordering of the compact roots Φ(k, t) which
form a subset of the set of all roots Φ(g, t). Let ρK denote the half sum of
the positive compact roots. Recall that a function f on G is called K-central
if f (kxk −1 ) = f (x) for all x ∈ G, k ∈ K. For any K-representation (ρ, V )
let V K denote the space of K-fixed vectors and let (τ̆ , Vτ̆ ) denote the dual
representation. The restriction from G to K gives a ring homomorphism of
the representation rings:

                         resG
                            K : Rep(G) → Rep(K).




Theorem 4.2 (Euler-Poincaré functions) Let (τ, Vτ ) a finite dimensional
representation of K. If either G is orientation preserving or τ lies in the
image of resG
            K , then there is a compactly supported smooth K-central function
fτ on G such that for every irreducible unitary representation (π, Vπ ) of G
we have
                              dim(p)
                               X
                tr π(fτ ) =          (−1)p dim(Vπ ⊗ ∧p p ⊗ Vτ̆ )K .
                              p=0

We call fτ an Euler-Poincaré function for τ .
If, moreover, K leaves invariant the decomposition p = p+ ⊕ p− then there
is a compactly supported smooth K-central function gτ on G such that for
every irreducible unitary representation (π, Vπ ) we have
                            dim(p− )
                             X
              tr π(gτ ) =              (−1)p dim(Vπ ⊗ ∧p p− ⊗ Vτ̆ )K .
                              p=0



Remark: If the representation τ lies in the image of resG
                                                        K or the group G is
connected then the theorem is well known, [4], [10]. We only included it for
the sake of completeness. We will therefore concentrate on the proof in the
case when G is orientation preserving.

Proof: We will concentrate on the case when G is orientation preserv-
ing,.suffice to say that the other case can be treated similarly. Without
loss of generality assume that τ is irreducible. Suppose given a function f
EULER-POINCARÉ FUNCTIONS                                                  10


which satisfies the claims of the theorem except that it is not necessarily
K-central, then the function
                                 Z
                            x 7→    f (kxk −1 )dk
                                     K
will satisfy all claims of the theorem. Thus one only needs to construct a
function having the claimed traces.
If G is orientation preserving the adjoint action gives a homomorphism K →
SO(p). If this homomorphism happens to lift to the double cover Spin(p)
[11] we let G̃ = G and K̃ = K. In the other case we apply the

Lemma 4.3 If the homomorphism K → SO(p) does not factor over Spin(p)
then there is a double covering G̃ → G such that with K̃ denoting the inverse
image of K the induced homomorphism K̃ → SO(p) factors over Spin(p) →
SO(p). Moreover the kernel of the map G̃ → G lies in the center of G̃

Proof: At first K̃ is given by the pullback diagram:
                              K̃    →      Spin(p)
                               ↓             ↓α
                                    Ad
                              K     →       SO(p)


that is, K̃ is given as the set of all (k, g) ∈ K × Spin(p) such that Ad(k) =
α(g). Then K̃ is a double cover of K.
Next we use the fact that K is a retract of G to show that the covering
K̃ → K lifts to G. Explicitly let P = exp(p0 ) then the map K × P →
G, (k, p) 7→ kp is a diffeomorphism [13]. Let g 7→ (k(g), p(g)) be its inverse
map. We let G̃ = K̃ × P then the covering K̃ → K defines a double
covering β : G̃ → G. We have to install a group structure on G̃ which makes
β a homomorphism and reduces to the known one on K̃. Now let k, k ′ ∈ K
and p, p′ ∈ P then by
                            k ′ p′ kp = k ′ k k −1 p′ kp
it follows that there are unique maps aK : P × P → K and aP : P × P → P
such that
                       k(k ′ p′ kp) = k ′ kaK (k −1 p′ k, p)
                       p(k ′ p′ kp) = aP (k −1 p′ k, p).
EULER-POINCARÉ FUNCTIONS                                                             11


Since P is simply connected the map aK lifts to a map ãK : P × P → K̃.
Since P is connected there is exactly one such lifting with ãK (1, 1) = 1. Now
the map
         (K̃ × P ) × (K̃ × P ) → K̃ × P
                (k ′ , p′ ), (k, p) 7→ (kk ′ ãK (k −1 p′ k, p), aP (k −1 p′ k, p))
defines a multiplication on G̃ = K̃ × P with the desired properties.
Finally ker(β) will automatically be central because it is a normal subgroup
of order two.                                                         Q.E.D.

Let S be the spin representation of Spin(p) (see [11], p.36). It splits as a
direct sum of two distinct irreducible representations
                                    S = S + ⊕ S −.
We will not go into the theory of the spin representation, we only need the
following properties:

   • The virtual representation
                                  (S + − S − ) ⊗ (S + − S − )
     is isomorphic to the adjoint representation on ∧even p − ∧odd p (see [11],
     p. 36).
   • If K leaves invariant the spaces p− and p+ , as is the case when X carries
     a holomorphic structure fixed by G, then there is a one dimensional
     representation ǫ of K̃ such that
                          (S + − S − ) ⊗ ǫ ∼
                                           = ∧even p− − ∧odd p− .

The proof of this latter property will be given in section 5.

Theorem 4.4 (Pseudo-coefficients) Assume that G is orientation preserv-
ing. Then for any finite dimensional representation (τ, Vτ ) of K̃ there is a
compactly supported smooth function hτ on G̃ such that for every irreducible
unitary representation (π, Vπ ) of G̃ it holds:

          tr π(hτ ) = dim(Vπ ⊗ S + ⊗ Vτ̆ )K̃ − dim(Vπ ⊗ S − ⊗ Vτ̆ )K̃ .
EULER-POINCARÉ FUNCTIONS                                                    12


The functions given in this theorem are also known as pseudo-coefficients [10].
This result generalizes the one in [10] in several ways. First, the group G
needn’t be connected and secondly the representation τ needn’t be spinorial.
The proof of this theorem relies on the following lemma.

Lemma 4.5 Let (π, Vπ ) be an irreducible unitary representation of G̃ and
assume
          dim(Vπ ⊗ S + ⊗ Vτ̆ )K̃ − dim(Vπ ⊗ S − ⊗ Vτ̆ )K̃ 6= 0,
then the Casimir eigenvalue satisfies π(C) = τ̆ (CK ) − B(ρ) + B(ρK ).

Proof: Let the K̃-invariant operator

                           d ± : Vπ ⊗ S ± → Vπ ⊗ S ∓

be defined by                         X
                      d± : v ⊗ s 7→       π(Xi )v ⊗ c(Xi )s,
                                      i

where (Xi ) is an orthonormal base of p. The formula of Parthasarathy, [1],
p. 55 now says

        d− d+ = d+ d− = π ⊗ s± (CK ) − π(C) ⊗ 1 − B(ρ) + B(ρK ).

Our assumption leads to ker(d+ d− ) ∩ π ⊗ S(τ ) 6= 0, and therefore 0 =
τ (CK ) − π(C) − B(ρ) + B(ρK ).                                  Q.E.D.

For the proof of Theorem 4.4 let (τ, Vτ ) a finite dimensional irreducible uni-
tary representation of K̃ and write Eτ for the G̃-homogeneous vector bundle
over X = G̃/K̃ defined by τ . The space of smooth sections Γ∞ (Eτ ) may
be written as Γ∞ (Eτ ) = (C ∞ (G̃) ⊗ Vτ )K̃ , where K̃ acts on C ∞ (G̃) by right
translations. The Casimir operator C of G̃ acts on this space and defines
a second order differential operator Cτ on Eτ . On the space of L2 -sections
L2 (X, Eτ ) = (L2 (G̃)⊗Vτ )K̃ this operator is formally selfadjoint with domain,
say, the compactly supported smooth functions and extends to a selfadjoint
operator. Consider a Schwartz function f on R such that the Fourier trans-
form fˆ has compact support. By general results on hyperbolic equations
([12], chap IV) it follows that the smoothing operator f (Cτ ), defined by the
spectral theorem has finite propagation speed. Since f (Cτ ) is G̃-equivariant
EULER-POINCARÉ FUNCTIONS                                                      13


it follows that f (Cτ ) can be represented as a convolution operator ϕ 7→ ϕ∗ f˘τ ,
for some f˘τ ∈ (Cc∞ (G̃) ⊗ End(Vτ ))K̃×K̃ and with f˜τ denoting the pointwise
trace of f˘τ we have for π ∈ G̃: ˆ tr π(f˜ ) = f (π(C)) dim(V ⊗ V )K̃ , where
                                           τ                   π     τ
π(C) denotes the Casimir eigenvalue on π. This construction extends to
virtual representations by linearity.
Choose f such that f (τ̆ (CK ) − B(ρ) + B(ρK )) = 1. Such an f clearly exists.
Let γ be the virtual representation of K̃ on the space

                             Vγ = (S + − S − ) ⊗ Vτ ,

then set hτ = f˜γ . Theorem 4.4 follows.                                  Q.E.D.

To get the first part of Theorem 4.2 from Theorem 4.4 one replaces τ in
the proposition by the virtual representation on (S + − S − ) ⊗ Vτ . Since
(S + − S − ) ⊗ (S + − S − ) is as K̃ module isomorphic to ∧∗ p we get the desired
function, say j on the group G̃. Now if G̃ 6= G let z be the nontrivial element
in the kernel of the isogeny G̃ → G, then the function
                                     1
                           f (x) =     (j(x) + j(zx))
                                     2
factors over G and satisfies the claim.
To get the second part of the theorem one proceeds similarly replacing τ by
ǫ ⊗ τ.                                                              Q.E.D.


5     Clifford algebras and Spin groups
This section is solely given to provide a proof of the properties of the spin
representation used in the last section. We will therefore not strive for the
utmost generality but plainly state things in the form needed. For more
details the reader is referred to [11].
Let V be a finite dimensional complex vector space and let q : V → C be
a non-degenerate quadratic form. We use the same letter for the symmetric
bilinear form:
                              1
                   q(x, y) = (q(x + y) − q(x) − q(y)).

Let SO(q) ⊂ GL(V ) be the special orthogonal group of q. The Clifford
algebra Cl(q) will be the quotient of the tensorial algebra
                       T V = C ⊕ V ⊕ (V ⊗ V ) ⊕ . . .
by the two-sided ideal generated by all elements of the form v ⊗ v + q(v),
where v ∈ V .
This ideal is not homogeneous with respect to the natural Z-grading of T V ,
but it is homogeneous with respect to the induced Z/2Z-grading given by
the even and odd degrees. Hence the latter is inherited by Cl(q):
                         Cl(q) = Cl0 (q) ⊕ Cl1 (q).
For any v ∈ V we have in Cl(q) that v 2 = −q(v) and therefore v is invertible
in Cl(q) if q(v) 6= 0. Let Cl(q)× be the group of invertible elements in Cl(q).
The algebra Cl(q) has the following universal property: For any linear map
ϕ : V → A to a C-algebra A such that ϕ(v)2 = −q(v) for all v ∈ V there is
a unique algebra homomorphism Cl(v) → A extending ϕ.
Let P in(q) be the subgroup of the group Cl(q)× generated by all elements v
of V with q(v) = ±1. Let the complex spin group be defined by
                        Spin(q) = P in(q) ∩ Cl0 (q),
i.e., the subgroup of P in(q) of those elements which are representable by an
even number of factors of the form v or v −1 with v ∈ V . Then Spin(q) acts
on V by x.v = xvx−1 and this gives a double covering: Spin(q) → SO(q).
Assume the dimension of V is even and let
                               V = V+⊕V−
be a polarization, that is q(V + ) = q(V − ) = 0. Over C polarizations always
exist for even dimensional spaces. By the nondegeneracy of q it follows that
to any v ∈ V + there is a unique v̂ ∈ V − such that q(v, v̂) = −1. Further, let
V −,v be the space of all w ∈ V − such that q(v, w) = 0, then
                             V − = Cv̂ ⊕ V −,v .
Let
              S = ∧∗ V − = C ⊕ V − ⊕ ∧2 V − ⊕ · · · ⊕ ∧top V − ,
then we define an action of Cl(q) on S in the following way:
EULER-POINCARÉ FUNCTIONS                                                   15


   • for v ∈ V − and s ∈ S let
                                    v.s = v ∧ s,

   • for v ∈ V + and s ∈ ∧∗ V −,v let
                                        v.s = 0,

   • and for v ∈ V + and s ∈ S of the form s = v̂ ∧ s′ with s′ ∈ ∧∗ V −,v let
                                     v.s = s′ .

By the universal property of Cl(V ) this extends to an action of Cl(q). The
module S is called the spin module. The induced action of Spin(q) leaves
invariant the subspaces
                     S + = ∧even V − ,        S − = ∧odd V − ,
the representation of Spin(q) on these spaces are called the half spin rep-
resentations. Let SO(q)+ the subgroup of all elements in SO(q) that leave
stable the decomposition V = V + ⊕ V − . This is a connected reductive group
isomorphic to GL(V + ), since, let g ∈ GL(V + ) and define ĝ ∈ GL(V − ) to be
the inverse of the transpose of g by the pairing induced by q then the map
Gl(v) → SO(q)+ given by g 7→ (g, ĝ) is an isomorphism. In other words,
                      +                            −
choosing a basis
               on V  and a the dual basis on V we get that q is given in
                 0 1
that basis by           . Then SO(q)+ is the image of the embedding
                 1 0
                        GL(V − ) ֒→ SO(q)

                                      A    0
                             A 7→               .

Let Spin(q)+ be the inverse image of SO(q)+ in Spin(q). Then the covering
Spin(q)+ → SO(q)+ ∼   = GL(V − ) is the “square root of the determinant”, i.e.,

Lemma 5.1 There is a one dimensional representation ǫ of Spin(q)+ such
that
                         S± ⊗ ǫ ∼= ∧± V
as Spin(q)+ -modules, where ∧± means the even or odd powers respectively.

Proof: Since Spin(q)+ is a connected reductive group over C we can apply
highest weight theory. If the weights of the representation of Spin(q)+ on V
are given by ±µ1 , . . . , ±µm , then the weights of the half spin representations
are given by
                                  1
                                    (±µ1 ± · · · ± µm )
                                  2
with an even number of minus signs in the one and an odd number in the
other case. Let ǫ = 12 (µ1 + · · · + µm ) then ǫ is a weight for Spin(q)+ and
2ǫ is the weight of, say, the one dimensional representation on ∧top V + . By
Weyl’s dimension formula this means that 2ǫ is invariant under the Weyl
group and therefore ǫ is. Again by Weyl’s dimension formula it follows that
the representation with highest weight ǫ is one dimensional. Now it follows
that S + ⊗ ǫ has the same weights as the representation on ∧+ V , hence must
be isomorphic to the latter. The case of the minus sign is analogous.

It now will be shown that tr π(fτ ) vanishes for a principal series representa-
tion π. To this end let P = MAN be a nontrivial parabolic subgroup with
A ⊂ exp(p0 ). Let (ξ, Vξ ) denote an irreducible unitary representation of M
and eν a quasicharacter of A. Let πξ,ν := IndG        ν

Proof: By Frobenius reciprocity we have for any irreducible unitary repre-
sentation γ of K:

                    HomK (γ, πξ,ν |K ) ∼
                                       = HomKM (γ|KM , ξ),

where KM := K ∩ M. This implies that tr πξ,ν (fτ ) does not depend on
ν. On the other hand tr πξ,ν (fτ ) 6= 0 for some ν would imply πξ,ν (C) =
τ̆ (CK ) − B(ρ) + B(ρK ) which only can hold for ν in a set of measure zero.

Recall that an element g of G is called elliptic if it lies in a compact Cartan
subgroup. Since the following relies on results of Harish-Chandra which were
proven under the assumption that G is of inner type, we will from now on
assume this.

Proposition 6.2 Assume that G is of inner type. Let g be a semisimple
element of the group G. If g is not elliptic, then the orbital integral Og (fτ )
vanishes. If g is elliptic we may assume g ∈ T , where T is a Cartan in K
and then we have
                                                     Y
                Og (fτ ) = tr τ (g) c−1
                                     g  |W (t, gg )|   (ρg , α),
                                                   α∈Φ+
                                                      g


where cg is Harish-Chandra’s constant, it does only depend on the centralizer
Gg of g. Its value is given in 1.

Proof: The vanishing of Og (fτ ) for nonelliptic semisimple g is immediate
by the lemma above and Theorem 3.3. So consider g ∈ T ∩ G′ , where
G′ denotes the set of regular elements. Note that for regular g the claim
is Og (fτ ) = tr τ (g). Assume the claim proven for regular elements, then
the general result follows by standard considerations as in [6], p.32 ff. where
however different Haar-measure normalizations are used that produce a factor
[Gg : G0g ], therefore these standard considerations are now explained. Fix

The factor [Gg1:G0 ] comes in by the Haar-measure normalizations. On G0g
                 g
consider the function
                           h(y) = f (x−1 η −1 ygηx).
Now apply Harish-Chandra’s operator ωGg to h then for the connected group
G0g it holds
                                                   G0
                           h(1) = lim cG0g ωG0g Oy g (h).
                                    y→1

When y tends to 1 the η-conjugation drops out and the claim follows.
So in order to prove the proposition one only has to consider the regular
orbital integrals. Next the proof will be reduced to the case when the compact
Cartan T meets all connected components of G. For this let G+ = T G0
and assume the claim proven for G+ . Let x ∈ G then xT x−1 again is a
compact Cartan subgroup. Since G0 acts transitively on all compact Cartan
subalgebras it follows that G0 acts transitively on the set of all compact
Cartan subgroups of G. It follows that there is a y ∈ G0 such that xT x−1 =
yT y −1 ⊂ T G0 = G+ , which implies that G+ is normal in G.
Let τ + = τ |G+ ∩K and fτ++ the corresponding Euler-Poincaré function on G+ .

Lemma 6.3 fτ++ = fτ |G+

Since the Euler-Poincaré function is not uniquely determined the claim reads
that the right hand side is a EP-function for G+ .
Proof: Let τ + = τ |K + , where K + = T K 0 = K ∩ G+ . Let ϕ+ ∈ (Cc∞ (G+ ) ⊗
     +
Vτ )K , which may be viewed as a function ϕ+ : G+ → Vτ with ϕ+ (xk) =

τ (k −1 )ϕ+ (x) for x ∈ G+ , k ∈ K + . Extend ϕ+ to ϕ : G → Vτ by ϕ(xk) =
τ (k −1 )ϕ+ (x) for x ∈ G+ , k ∈ K. This defines an element of (Cc∞ (G) ⊗ Vτ )K
with ϕ|G+ = ϕ+ . Since Cτ is a differential operator it follows f (Cτ )ϕ|G+ =
f (Cτ )ϕ+ , so
                              (ϕ ∗ f˜τ )|G+ = ϕ+ ∗ f˜τ + .
Considering the normalizations of Haar measures gives the lemma.

Lemma 6.4 Assume T meets all components of G. For any ψ ∈ C ∞ (K)
the operator π|K (ψ) is of trace class and for ψ supported in the regular set
K ′ = K ∩ G′ we have
                                     Z
                        tr π|K (ψ) =    ψ(k)Θπ (k)dk.
                                       K

(For G connected this assertion is in [1] p.16.)

                     L
Proof: Let Vπ = i Vπ (i) be the decomposition of Vπ into K-types. This is
stable under π|K (ψ).P Harish-Chandra has proven [π|K : τ ] ≤ dim τ for any
τ ∈ K̂. Let ψ = j ψj be the decomposition of ψ into K-bitypes. Since ψ
is smooth the sequence k ψj k1 is rapidly decreasing for any enumeration of
                                         1
the
P K-bitypes. Here k ψ k1 is the L -norm on K. It follows that the sum
   i tr (π|K (ψ)|Vπ (i)) converges absolutely, hence π|K (ψ) is of trace class.

Now let S = exp(p0 ) then S is a smooth set of representatives of G/K. Let
G.K = ∪g∈G gKg −1 = ∪s∈S sKs−1 , then, since G has a compact Cartan, the
set G.K has non-empty interior. Applying the Weyl integration formula to
G and backwards to K gives the existence of a smooth measure µ on S and
a function D with D(k) > 0 on the regular set such that
                Z              Z Z
                     ϕ(x)dx =       ϕ(sks−1 )D(k)dkdµ(s)

                               (s, k) 7→ sks−1

Then the differential of F is an isomorphism at any point and by the inverse
function theorem F locally is a diffeomorphism. So let U ⊂ S and W ⊂ K ′
be open sets such that F |U ×W is a diffeomorphism. Then let α ∈ Cc∞ (U) and
β ∈ Cc∞ (W ), then define

                  φ(sks−1 ) = α(s)β(k) if s ∈ U, k ∈ W

and ϕ(g)
    R    = 0 if g is not in F (U × W ). We can choose the function α such
that S α(s)dµ(s) = 1. Then
                    Z
                       ϕ(sks−1 )dµ(s)D(k) = β(k)D(k).

Since β was arbitrary and D(k) > 0 on K ′ the lemma follows.         Q.E.D.

Lemma 6.5 Assume T meets all components of G, then for any π ∈ Ĝ the
function Θπ χW on K ′ = K ∩ G′ equals a finite integer linear combination of
K-characters.

Proof: It suffices to show the assertion for τ = 1. Let ϕ be the homo-
morphism K → O(p) induced by the adjoint representation, where the or-
thogonal group is formed with respect to the Killing form. We claim that
ϕ(K) ⊂ SO(p), the subgroup of elements of determinant one. Since we as-
sume K = K 0 T it suffices to show ϕ(T ) ⊂ SO(p). For this let t ∈ T . Since
t centralizes t it fixes the decomposition p = ⊕α pα into one dimensional root
spaces. So t acts by a scalar, say c on pα and by d on p−α . There is X ∈ pα
and Y ∈ p−α such that B(X, Y ) = 1. By the invariance of the Killing form
B we get

          1 = B(X, Y ) = B(Ad(t)X, Ad(t)Y ) = cdB(X, Y ) = cd.

So on each pair of root spaces Ad(t) has determinant one hence also on p.
Replacing G by a double cover if necessary, which doesn’t effect the claim
of the lemma, we may assume that ϕ lifts to the spin group Spin(p). Let
p = p+ ⊕ p− be the decomposition according to an ordering of φ(t, g). This
decomposition is a polarization of the quadratic space p and hence the spin
group acts on S + = ∧even p+ and S − = ∧odd p+ in a way that the virtual
module (S + − S − ) ⊗ (S + − S − ) becomes isomorphic to W . For K connected
the claim now follows from [1] (4.5). An inspection shows however that the
proof of (4.5) in [1], which is located in the appendix (A.12), already applies
when we only assume that the homomorphism ϕ factors over the spin group.
                                                                        Q.E.D.

We continue the proof of the proposition. Let T̂ denote the set of all unitary
characters of T . Any regular element t̂ ∈ T̂ gives rise to a discrete series
representation (ω, Vω ) of G. Let Θt̂ = Θω be its character which, due to
Harish-Chandra, is known to be a function on G. Harish-Chandra’s con-
struction gives a bijection between the set of discrete series representations
of G and the set of W (G, T ) = W (K, T )-orbits of regular characters of T .
Let Φ+ denote the set of positive roots of (g, t) and let Φ+   +
                                                           c ,Φn denote the
subsets of compact and noncompact positive roots. For each root α let t 7→ tα

denote the corresponding character on T . Define

and ′ ∆ =′ ∆′c ∆n . If t̂ ∈ T̂ is singular, Harish-Chandra has also constructed
an invariant distribution Θt̂ which is a virtual character onP  G. For t̂ singular
let W (t̂) ⊂ W (g, t) be the isotropy group. One has Θt̂ = w∈W (t̂) ǫ(w)Θ′w,t̂
with Θ′w,t̂ the character of an induced representation acting on some Hilbert
space Vw,t̂ and ǫ(w) ∈ {±1}. Let E2 (G) denote the set of discrete series rep-
resentations of G and E2s (G) the set of W (G, T )-orbits of singular characters.
By Theorem 3.3 the proposition will follow from the

Lemma 6.6 For t ∈ T regular we have
                                      1       X
                    tr τ (t) =                  Θt̂ (fτ )Θt̂ (t).

                                              t̂∈T̂



Proof: Let γ denote the virtual K-representation on (∧even p − ∧odd p) ⊗ Vτ .
Harish-Chandra has shown ([7] Theorem 12) that for any t̂ ∈ T̂ there is an
irreducible unitary representation πt̂0 such that Θt̂ coincides up to sign with
the character of πt̂0 on the set of elliptic elements of G and πt̂0 = πt̂0′ if and
only if there is a w ∈ W (G, T ) = W (K, T ) such that t̂′ = w t̂.
Further ([7], Theorem 14) Harish-Chandra has shown that the family
                                         !
                           ′

                             |W (G, T )| t̂∈T̂ /W (G,T )

forms an orthonormal basis of L2 (T ). Here we identify T̂ /W (G, T ) to a set
of representatives in T̂ to make Θt̂ well defined.

Consider the function g(t) = tr γ(t)   △c (t)

                                              = tr τ (t) ′ △(t). Its coefficients with

respect to the above orthonormal basis are

where we have used the Weyl integration formula for the group K and the
fact that W (G, T ) = W (K, T ). Next by Lemma 6.5 this equals
   p                                                      p
      |W (G, T )| dim((∧even p − ∧odd p) ⊗ τ̆ ⊗ πt̂0 )K =  |W (G, T )|Θt̂ (fτ ).
Hence
                   g(t) = tr τ (t) ′ △(t)

The lemma and the proposition are proven.                                     Q.E.D.


Corollary 6.7 If g̃ ∈ G̃ is semisimple and not elliptic then Og̃ (gτ ) = 0. If
g̃ is elliptic regular then
                                                       tr τ (g̃)
                             Og̃ (gτ ) =                            .
                                                 tr (g̃|S + − S − )

Proof: Same as for the last proposition with gτ replacing fτ .                Q.E.D.


Proposition 6.8 Assume that τ extends to a representation of the group G
on the same space. For the function fτ we have for any π ∈ Ĝ:
                                 dim g/k
                                   X
                tr π(fτ ) =               (−1)p dim Extp(g,K)(Vτ , Vπ ),
                                   p=0

i.e., fτ gives the Euler-Poincaré numbers of the (g, K)-modules (Vτ , Vπ ), this
justifies the name Euler-Poincaré function.

Proof: By definition it is clear that
                             dim p
                             X
               tr π(fτ ) =         (−1)p dim H p (g, K, Vτ̆ ⊗ Vπ ).
                             p=0

The claim now follows from [2], p. 52.                                 Q.E.D.
