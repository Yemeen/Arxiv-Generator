                                                   SPECHT MODULES FOR FINITE REFLECTION GROUPS

                                                                                  by S. HALICIOĞLU



                                            1. Introduction

                                               Over fields of characteristic zero, there are well known constructions of the irreducible repre-
                                            sentations, due to A Young, and of irreducible modules, called Specht modules, due to W Specht,
                                            for the symmetric groups Sn which are based on elegant combinatorial concepts connected with
                                            Young tableaux etc.(see, e.g.[13]). James [12] extended these ideas to construct irreducible
                                            representations and modules over arbitrary field. Al-Aamily, Morris and Peel [1] showed how
                                            this construction could be extended cover the Weyl groups of type Bn . In [14] Morris described
                                            a possible extension of James’ work for Weyl groups in general. Later, the present author and
                                            Morris [8] give an alternative generalisation of James’ work which is an extended improvement
                                            and extension of the original approach suggested by Morris. We now give a possible extension
                                            of James’ work for finite reflection groups in general.

                                            2. Some General Results On Finite Reflection Groups

                                               In this section we establish the notation and state some results on finite reflection groups
                                            which are required later . Standard references for this material are N Bourbaki [3], R W Carter
                                            [4], J E Humphreys [10] [11], Grove and Benson [7].

                                               Let V be l-dimensional Euclidean space over the real field R equipped with a positive definite
                                            inner product ( , ). For α ∈ V , α 6= 0, let τα be the ref lection in the hyperplane orthogonal to
                                            α, that is, τα is the linear transformation on V defined by

                                                                                                   (α, v)
                                                                                  τα (v) = v − 2          α
                                                                                                   (α, α)

                                            for all v ∈ V . Let Φ be a root system in V and π be a simple system in Φ with corresponding
                                            positive system Φ+ and negative system Φ− . Then the finite reflection group

                                                          W = W(Φ) =< τα | τα2 = e, (τα τβ )mαβ = e, α, β ∈ π and α 6= β >

                                            where e is the identity element of W and mαβ is the order of τα τβ . Let l(w) denote the length
                                            of w and the sign of w, s(w), is defined by s(w) = ( − 1 )l(w) , w ∈ W.

                                                                                            1
   We note the following facts which are required later.

2.1. There are | W | simple systems (positive systems) in Φ given by wπ (wΦ+ ), w ∈ W. The
group W acts transitively on the set of simple systems.

2.2. To each root system Φ, there corresponds a graph Γ called the Coxeter graph (or Dynkin
diagram) of W, whose nodes are 1 : 1 correspondence with the elements of π. A finite reflection
group is irreducible if its Coxeter graph is connected. Finite irreducible reflection groups have
been classified and correspond to root systems of type Al (l ≥ 1), Bl (l ≥ 2), Cl (l ≥ 3), Dl (l ≥ 4),
E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 , G2 , H3 , H4 , I2 ( p ) (p = 5 or p ≥ 7). For example W ( Al ) ∼        = Sl+1 ,
the symmetric group on the set {1, 2, ..., l + 1} . As our aim in this paper is to generalise
ideas from the symmetric groups, the root system and simple system are given in this case. If
{ ǫ1 , ǫ2 , ... , ǫl+1 } is the standard basis for Rl+1 , then

                  π = { α1 = ǫ1 − ǫ2 , α2 = ǫ2 − ǫ3 , ... , αl = ǫl − ǫl+1 }

                               Φ = { ǫi − ǫj | 1 ≤ i , j ≤ l + 1}
                             Φ+ = { ǫi − ǫj | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ l + 1}

2.3. A subsystem Ψ of Φ is a subset of Φ which is itself a root system in the space which it spans.
A subsystem Ψ is said to be additively closed if α , β ∈ Ψ , α + β ∈ Φ , then α + β ∈ Ψ . From
now on we assume that Ψ is additively closed subsystem of Φ. A f inite ref lection subgroup
W(Ψ) of W corresponding to a subsystem Ψ is the subgroup of W generated by the τα , α ∈ Ψ.
If Ψ and Υ are subsystems of Φ which span subspaces U and W of V respectively , then Ψ and
Υ are isomorphic if there exists a vector space isomorphism θ : U → W such that θ (Ψ) = Υ
and

                  (θ(α), θ(β))   (α , β )
                               =                                 f or all α , β ∈ Ψ .
                  (θ(β), θ(β))   (β, β)

It follows that

                                W (Ψ) ∼
                                      = W (Υ) = θ W (Ψ) θ −1 .

The subsytems Ψ and Υ are conjugate under W if Υ = wΨ for some w ∈ W ; in this case
W (w Ψ) = w W (Ψ) w−1 since τw (α) = w τα w−1 for α ∈ Ψ . Note that isomorphic subsystems
are not necessarily conjugate.

2.4. The graphs which are Dynkin diagrams of subsystems of Φ may be obtained up to conjugacy
by a standard algorithm due independently to E B Dynkin, A Borel and J de Siebenthal (see
e.g. [4]).

                                                  2
2.5. If w ∈ W and U is the subspace of V composed of all vectors fixed by w, then w is a
product of reflections corresponding to roots in the orthogonal complement U ⊥ of U . [4]

2.6. The simple system J of Ψ can always be chosen such that J ⊂ Φ+ . [15]

2.7. The set DΨ = {w ∈ W | w(j) ∈ Φ+ f or all j ∈ J } is a distinguished set of coset
representatives of W(Ψ) in W , that is, each element w ∈ W has unique expression of the form
dΨ wΨ , where dΨ ∈ DΨ and wΨ ∈ W(Ψ) and furthermore dΨ is the element of minimal length
in the coset dΨ W(Ψ). [15]

3. Specht Modules for Finite Reflection Groups

     Let Φ be a root system with simple system π and Coxeter graph Γ and let Ψ be a subsystem
                                                                                                          r
                                                                                                          [

                                                                                                          i=1
indecomposable components of Ψ , then let Ji be a simple system in Ψi (i = 1, 2, ..., r) and
      r

J=          Ji . Let Ψ⊥ be the largest subsystem in Φ orthogonal to Ψ and let J ⊥ ⊂ Φ+ the simple
      i=1
system of Ψ⊥ .

     Let Ψ be a subsystem of Φ which is contained in Φ \ Ψ , with simple system J ⊂ Φ+ and

Ji be a simple system in Ψi (i = 1, 2, ..., s) and J =                       Ji . Let Ψ                  be the largest subsystem in
                                                                       i=1

Φ orthogonal to Ψ and let J                  ⊂ Φ+ the simple system of Ψ                        .

   Let J¯ stand for the ordered set {J1 , J2 , ..., Jr ; J1 , J2 , ..., Js } , where in addition the elements
                                                                   ′    ′              ′

                 ′
in each Ji and Ji are ordered. Let
                                                     TJ,J ′ = {wJ¯ | w ∈ W}

   Now , we consider under what conditions the elements in the set TJ,J ′ are distinct. Such a
condition is now obtained in the following lemma.
                                                                                  ′⊥
3.1. Lemma. | TJ,J ′ |=| W | if and only if W(J ⊥ ) ∩ W(J ) =< e > .

Proof. See Lemma 3.1 [ 8 ]                       ✷

     Now we can give our principal definition .
                                             ′                                                                          ′
3.2. Definition. Let Ψ and Ψ be subsystems of Φ with simple systems J and J respectively
           ′                      ′                     ′
such that Ψ ⊆ Φ \ Ψ and J ⊂ Φ+ , J ⊂ Φ+ . The pair {J, J } is called a usef ul system in Φ if
             ′                        ′⊥
W(J) ∩ W(J ) =< e > and W(J ⊥ ) ∩ W(J ) =< e >.
                            ′                                                              ′
Remark 1. If {J, J } is a useful system in Φ , then {wJ, wJ } is also a useful system in Φ, for

                                                               3
w ∈ W. Thus , from now on TJ,J ′ will be denoted by T∆ .

Remark 2. If {J, J } is a useful system in Φ then Ψ ∩ Ψ = ∅ and Ψ⊥ ∩ Ψ                    = ∅. However the
converse is not true in general.
                                        ′
3.3. Definition. Let {J, J } be a useful system in Φ . Then the elements of T∆ are called
                          ′                                             ′
∆ − tableaux, the Ji and Ji are called the rows and the columns of {J, J } respectively.

3.4. Definition. Two ∆-tableaux J¯ and K̄ are row − equivalent , written J¯ ∼ K̄ , if there
exists w ∈ W(J) such that K̄ = w J.¯ The equivalence class which contains the ∆-tableau J¯
    ¯ and is called a ∆ − tabloid.
is {J}

  Let τ∆ be the set of all ∆-tabloids . It is clear that the number of distinct elements in τ∆ is
[W : W(J)] and by ( 2.7 ) we have
                                              τ∆ = {{ dJ¯ } | d ∈ DΨ }
                            ′                     ′
We note that if J¯ = { J ; J } then dJ ⊂ Φ+ but dJ need not be a subset of Φ+ .

   We now give an example to illustrate the construction of a ∆-tabloid. In this example and
later examples we use the following notation. If π = {α1 , α2 , ..., αn } is a simple system in Φ
                                 n
                                 X
and α ∈ Φ, then α =                    ai αi , where ai ∈ Z. From now on α is denoted by a1 a2 ...an and
                                 i=1
τα1 , τα2 , ..., ταn are denoted by τ1 , τ2 , ..., τn respectively.

3.5. Example. Let Φ = D4 with simple system
                       π = {α1 = ǫ1 − ǫ2 , α2 = ǫ2 − ǫ3 , α3 = ǫ3 − ǫ4 , α4 = ǫ3 + ǫ4 }
                                                                                          ′
Let Ψ1 = A3 be the subsystem of D4 with J = {1000, 0100, 0010}. Let Ψ = 2A1 be the
                                                                 ′
subsystem of Φ which is contained in Φ \ Ψ, with simple system J = {1101, 0111}. Since
            ′                            ′⊥                    ′
W(J) ∩ W(J ) =< e > and W(J ⊥ ) ∩ W(J ) =< e >, then {J, J } is a useful system in Φ.
Then τ∆ contains the ∆ − tabloids ;
     {J¯}                        =   {1000, 0100, 0010; 1101, 0111}

     {τ4 τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 J}       =   {0010, 0100, 1000; −1101, −0111}

   The group W acts on τ∆ according to
                                        σ {wJ } = {σwJ }       f or all σ ∈ W.

                                                           4
This action is well defined , for if {w1 J} = {w2 J} , then there exists ρ ∈ W(w1 J) such that
ρw1 J = w2 J . Hence since σρσ −1 ∈ W(σw1 J) and σw2 J = σρw1 J = (σρσ −1 )(σw1 J) , we have
{σw1 J} = {σw2 J} .

   Now if K is arbitrary field , let M ∆ be the K-space whose basis elements are the ∆-tabloids.
Extend the action of W on τ∆ linearly on M ∆ , then M ∆ becomes a KW-module. Then we
have the following lemma.

3.6. Lemma. The KW-module M ∆ is a cyclic KW-module generated by any one tabloid and
dimK M ∆ = [W : W(J)]

   Now we proceed to consider the possibility of constructing a KW-module which corresponds
to the Specht module in the case of symmetric groups. In order to do this we need to define a

                                      X
                       κJ ′ =                 s(σ)σ

                                σ ∈ W(J )

where s is the sign function defined in Section 2 . Then eJ,J ′ is called the generalized ∆ −
polytabloid associated with J.

  If w ∈ W(Φ) , then
                                                       X
                                w κJ ′        =                    s(σ)wσ
                                                           ′

                                                       X
                                              =                    s ( σ ) (w σ w−1 ) w
                                                  σ ∈ W(J ′ )
                                                           X
                                              =   {                      s(σ)σ}w

                                                       σ ∈ W(wJ )

Hence, for all w ∈ W(Φ), we have

    w eJ,J ′       =   κwJ ′ { wJ } = ewJ,wJ ′                          ( 3.1 )

    Let S J,J be the subspace of M ∆ generated by ewJ,wJ ′ where w ∈ W. Then by (3.1) S J,J

   Proposition 3.9 says that a generalized Specht module is dependent only on the Dynkin

   The following lemma shows that the extra condition W(J) ∩ W(J ) =< e > in our definition
of a useful system is necessary. Unfortunately this condition which is a group theoretical one is
not easily checked and it would be useful if it could be replaced by a criterion in terms of the
root system only.
                                                                  ′
3.13. Lemma. If there exists w ∈ W(J) ∩ W(J ) such that w has order 2 , and s(w) = -1 then

3.21. Corollary. Let {J, J } be a good system in Φ. If m ∈ M ∆ then κJ ′ m is a multiple of

   We now define a bilinear form < , > on M ∆ by setting

                                                                1 if {J¯1 } = {J¯2 }

This is a symmetric, non-singular, W-invariant bilinear form on M ∆ .

S ∆,∆ ⊆ U in which case U = S ∆,∆ or U ⊆ S ∆,∆ and U ⊆ S ∆,∆ ∩ S ∆,∆ , which
completes the proof.

   In the case of K = Q or any field of characteristic zero < , > is an inner product and
     ′          ′                                                    ′
D ∆,∆   = S ∆,∆ . Thus if for a subsystem Ψ of Φ a good system {J, J } can be found , then
we have a construction for irreducible KW-modules . Hence it is essential to show for each
subsystem that a good system exists which satisfies Definition 3.19.

   In the following example, we show how a good system may be constructed in all cases for
the finite reflection group of type G2 . In [9], we present an algorithm for constructing a good
system for certain subsystems; indeed this algorithm will give a good system with additional
                                                                                         ′
properties which will lead to the construction of a K-basis for our Specht modules S ∆,∆ , which
correspond to the basis consisting of standard tableaux in the case of symmetric groups.

                              S ∆4 ,∆1 = Sp { eJ4 ,J ′ , eτ1 J4 ,τ1 J ′ }
                                                                         1             1


where
    eJ4 ,J ′               = {J¯4 } − {τ2 τ1 J4 } − {τ1 τ2 τ1 J4 } + {τ1 τ2 τ1 τ2 τ1 J4 }
           1
    eτ1 J4 ,τ1 J ′         = {τ1 J4 } − {τ2 τ1 J4 } − {τ1 τ2 τ1 J4 } + {τ2 τ1 τ2 τ1 J4 }
                   1
                                                                                           ′
   Let T41 be the matrix representation of W afforded by S ∆4 ,∆1 with character ψ41 and let τ1 τ2
be the representative of the conjugate class C3 . Then
   τ1 τ2 (eJ4 ,J ′ )             = eτ1 J4 ,τ1 J ′ − eJ4 ,J ′
                       1                      1            1
   τ1 τ2 (eτ1 J4 ,τ1 J ′ ) = − eJ4 ,J ′
                            1                     1

   Thus we have

                                                                    9
                                 !
                          −1 1
  T41   ( τ1 τ2 ) =                  and ψ41 (τ1 τ2 ) = −1.
                          −1 0
   By a similar calculation to the above it can be shown that ψ41 = χ5 . By the same method to
the above, we have
                      ′              ′
    Ψ            Ψ               J          Ch
    A2           A1          {10}           χ4
    A1 + Ã1     Ã1         {01}           χ5
    A1           A2          {01, 31}       χ3
    Ã1          A1 + Ã1    {11, 31}       χ5
    G2             ∅          ∅             χ1
      ∅          G2          {10, 01}       χ2

   We note that the irreducible modules corresponding to the characters χ6 have not been
                                                                                        ′
obtained. We now show how an additional irreducible character is obtained. Let Ψ2 = A1
                                             ′                         ′
be the subsystem of Φ with simple system J2 = {11}. Then {J4 , J2 } is a useful system in Φ.
        ′    ′                        ′                                ′
Since Ψ2 ⊂ Ψ1 , by Lemma 3.15 S ∆1 ,∆1 is a KW-submodule of S ∆1 ,∆2 . By a similar calculation,
                                                    ′         ′
the corresponding character of W afforded by S ∆1 ,∆2 /S ∆1 ,∆1 is χ6 . Thus we have obtained a
complete set of irreducible modules for G2 .
