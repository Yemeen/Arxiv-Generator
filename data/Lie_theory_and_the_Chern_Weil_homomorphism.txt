                                                  Abstract. Let P → B be a principal G-bundle. For any connection θ on P , the Chern-Weil
                                                  construction of characteristic classes defines an algebra homomorphism from the Weil algebra
                                                  W g = Sg∗ ⊗ ∧g∗ into the algebra of differential forms A = Ω(P ). Invariant polynomials
                                                  (Sg∗ )inv ⊂ W g map to cocycles, and the induced map in cohomology (Sg∗ )inv → H(Abasic ) is
                                                  independent of the choice of θ. The algebra Ω(P ) is an example of a commutative g-differential
                                                  algebra with connection, as introduced by H. Cartan in 1950. As observed by Cartan, the
                                                  Chern-Weil construction generalizes to all such algebras.
                                                      In this paper, we introduce a canonical Chern-Weil map W g → A for possibly non-
                                                  commutative g-differential algebras with connection. Our main observation is that the gener-
                                                  alized Chern-Weil map is an algebra homomorphism “up to g-homotopy”. Hence, the induced
                                                  map (Sg∗ )inv → Hbasic (A) is an algebra homomorphism. As in the standard Chern-Weil
                                                  theory, this map is independent of the choice of connection.
                                                      Applications of our results include: a conceptually easy proof of the Duflo theorem for
                                                  quadratic Lie algebras, a short proof of a conjecture of Vogan on Dirac cohomology, generalized

                                                  symmetric pairs, and a new construction of universal characteristic forms in the Bott-Shulman
                                                  complex.

                                      1. Introduction
    In an influential paper from 1950, H. Cartan [9] presented an algebraic framework for the
Chern-Weil [10, 43] construction of characteristic classes in terms of differential forms. In
Cartan’s approach, the de Rham complex Ω(P ) of differential forms on a principal G-bundle
P is generalized to a differential algebra A, together with algebraic counterparts of the Lie
derivative and contraction operations for the action of the Lie algebra g of G. We will refer to
any such A as a g-differential algebra. Cartan introduced the notion of an algebraic connection
on A; g-differential algebras admitting connections are called locally free and are viewed as
algebraic counterparts of principal bundles. A counterpart of the base of the principal bundle
is the basic subcomplex Abasic . The Weil algebra W g = Sg∗ ⊗∧g∗ replaces the classifying bundle
EG → BG. The generators of ∧g∗ are viewed as “universal connections”, the generators of Sg∗
as “universal curvatures”. Cartan shows that if A is any (graded) commutative g-differential
algebra with connection θ, there is a characteristic homomorphism
(1)                                      cθ : W g → A
sending the generators of ∧g∗ to the connection variables of A and the generators of Sg∗ to
the curvature variables of A. Passing to the cohomology of the basic subcomplex, this gives a
homomorphism
(2)                          (Sg∗ )inv = H((W g)basic ) → H(Abasic )
from the algebra of invariant polynomials on the Lie algebra g into the cohomology algebra
of the basic subcomplex of A. As in the usual Chern-Weil theory, this homomorphism is
independent of the choice of θ.
   The main theme of this paper is a generalization of Cartan’s algebraic Chern-Weil construc-
tion to possibly non-commutative g-differential algebras. The idea in the general case is to
define cθ by a suitable ordering prescription. Recall that any linear map E → A from a vector
space to an associative algebra A extends to a linear map S(E) → A from the symmetric
algebra, by symmetrization. This also holds for Z2 -graded vector spaces and algebras, using
super symmetrization (i.e. taking signs into account). The Weil algebra may be viewed as the
(super) symmetric algebra S(E) over the space E spanned by the generators µ ∈ g∗ of ∧g∗
and their differentials µ = dµ, and a connection θ on a g-differential algebra A defines a linear
map E → A. With cθ : W g → A defined by symmetrization, we prove:

Theorem A. For any g-differential algebra A with connection θ, the map cθ : W g → A is
a homomorphism of g-differential spaces. The induced homomorphism in basic cohomology
(Sg∗ )inv → H(Abasic ) is independent of θ, and is an algebra homomorphism.

   In fact, we will show that any two homomorphisms of g-differential spaces W g → A induce
the same map in basic cohomology, provided they agree on the unit element of W g. Note that
the Weil algebra could also be viewed as a super symmetric algebra over the subspace E ′ ⊂ W g
spanned by the universal connections and curvatures. However, the resulting symmetrization
map W g = S(E ′ ) → A would not be a chain map, in general.
   Our first application of Theorem A gives a new perspective on the proof of [1] of the Duflo
isomorphism for quadratic Lie algebras. Recall that a Lie algebra g is called quadratic if it
                        LIE THEORY AND THE CHERN-WEIL HOMOMORPHISM                                         3

comes equipped with an invariant scalar product B. Let Wg be the non-commutative super
algebra generated by odd elements ξ and even elements ξ for ξ ∈ g, subject to relations
                  ξ̄ ξ̄ ′ − ξ¯′ ξ̄ = [ξ, ξ ′ ]g, ξ̄ξ ′ − ξ ′ ξ¯ = [ξ, ξ ′ ]g, ξξ ′ + ξ ′ ξ = B(ξ, ξ ′ ).
Using B to identify g∗ and g, we obtain a symmetrization map W g → Wg. The following is a
fairly easy consequence of Theorem A:

Theorem B. There is a commutative diagram
                                                   WO g         / Wg
                                                                   O


                                                   Sg            / Ug

in which the vertical maps are injective algebra homomorphisms and the horizontal maps are
vector space isomorphisms. The lower map restricts an algebra isomorphism on invariants.

   Recall that the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt symmetrization Sg → U g does not restrict to an
algebra homomorphism on invariants, in general. On the other hand, it was shown by Duflo
that the PBW map does have this property if it is pre-composed with a certain infinite order
differential operator known as the “Duflo factor”.

Theorem C. The lower horizontal map in the commutative diagram of Theorem B coincides
with the Duflo map [13].

   That is, while the Duflo map is not a symmetrization map for U g, it may be viewed as
the restriction of a symmetrization map of a super algebra containing U g! We stress that our
theory only covers the case of quadratic Lie algebras – it remains a mystery how the general
situation might fit into this picture.
   Suppose k ⊂ g is a quadratic subalgebra of g, i.e. that the restriction of B|k is non-degenerate.
Let p denote the orthogonal complement to k in p, and Cl(p) its Clifford algebra. In [25], Kostant
introduced a canonical element Dg,k of the algebra (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv which he called the cubic
Dirac operator. He showed that Dg,k squares to an element of the center of this algebra, so that
the graded commutator [Dg,k, ·] is a differential. The cohomology of this differential features in
a conjecture of Vogan. Generalizing results of Huang-Pandzic [20] and Kostant [26] we prove:

Theorem D. There is a natural algebra homomorphism (U k)k−inv → (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv , tak-
ing values in cocycles and inducing an isomorphism in cohomology. The map (U g)g−inv →
(U k)k−inv taking z ∈ (U g)g−inv to the cohomology class of z ⊗ 1 coincides with the restriction
map (Sg)g−inv → (Sk)k−inv under the Duflo isomorphisms for g and k.

  Our next result is a Harish-Chandra map for a quadratic Lie algebra g with a decomposition
g = n− ⊕ k ⊕ n+ , where k is a quadratic Lie subalgebra of g and n± are k-invariant isotropic
subalgebras (that is, the restriction of B to n± vanishes). By the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt
theorem, the splitting of g gives rise to a decomposition of the enveloping algebra U g, hence
4                               A. ALEKSEEV AND E. MEINRENKEN

to a projection κU : U g → U k. As for the usual Harish-Chandra projection, it is convenient to
compose κU with a certain automorphism τ of U k (the “ρ-shift”).

Theorem E. Under the Duflo isomorphisms for g, k, the composition τ ◦ κU : (U g)g−inv →
(U k)k−inv coincides with the projection (Sg)g−inv → (Sk)k−inv . In particular, it is an algebra
homomorphism.

   We obtain Theorem E by studying the Harish-Chandra projection κW : Wg → Wk, and
comparing to the natural projection κW : W g → W k. It turns out that κW directly restricts
to τ ◦ κU : That is, the shift τ emerges from the theory in a very natural way and need not be
put in ’by hand’.
   Let (g, k) be a symmetric pair, that is, k is the fixed point set of an involutive automorphism
ǫ on g. Let p be its complement given as the eigenspace of ǫ for the eigenvalue −1. By
results of Lichnerowicz [30] and Duflo [14], the algebra (U g/U gkf )k−inv (where kf ֒→ U g a
suitable “twisted” inclusion of k) is commutative. Rouvière in his paper [37] introduced a map
(Sp)k−inv → (U g/U gkf )k−inv generalizing the Duflo isomorphism, and described conditions
under which this map is an algebra isomorphism. We prove a similar result for the following
new class of examples:

Theorem F. Suppose g carries an invariant scalar product B that changes sign under ǫ. Then
the Duflo-Rouvière map (Sp)k−inv → (U g/U gkf )k−inv is an algebra isomorphism.

   Anti-invariance of B under the involution ǫ implies that B vanishes on both k and p, and
gives a non-degenerate pairing between the two subspaces. In line with our general strategy,
we prove this result by identifying the Duflo-Rouvière map as a Chern-Weil map, using the
isomorphism (Sp)k−inv = (Sk∗ )k−inv given by the pairing. We also describe a generalization to
isotropic subalgebras k ⊂ g of quadratic Lie algebras.
   Our final result is a new construction of universal characteristic forms in the Bott-Shulman
complex. For any Lie group G, Bott and Shulman considered a double complex Ωq (Gp ) as a
model for differential forms on the classifying space BG, and showed how to associate to any
invariant polynomial on g a cocycle forL  the total differential on this double complex. In our
alternative approach, we observe that            q  p
                                            p,q Ω (G ) carries a non-commutative product, and
obtain:

Theorem G. The generalized Chern-Weil construction defines a linear map
                                           M
                               (Sg∗ )inv →   Ωq (Gp )
                                                 p,q

taking values in cocycles for the total differential. The image of a polynomial of degree r under
this map has non-vanishing components only in bidegree p + q = 2r with p ≤ r. The map
induces an algebra homomorphism in cohomology, and in fact an algebra isomorphism if G is
compact.

Institute for Mathematical Physics.

                         2. Non-commutative differential algebras
   In this Section we review some material on symmetrization maps for super vector spaces and
g-differential spaces. Our conventions for super spaces will follow [12]; in particular we take
the categorical point of view that super vector spaces form a tensor category where the super
sign convention is built into the isomorphism E ⊗ E ′ → E ′ ⊗ E. The concept of g-differential
spaces is due to Cartan [9], a detailed treatment can be found in the book [18].

2.1. Conventions and notation. Throughout, we will work over a field F of characteristic
0. A super vector space is a vector space over F with a Z2 -grading E = E 0̄ ⊕ E 1̄ . Super
vector spaces form an F-linear tensor category; algebra objects in this tensor category are
called super algebras, Lie algebra objects are called super Lie algebras. If E, E ′ are super
vector spaces, we denote by L(E, E ′ ) the super space of all linear maps A : E → E ′ , and
by End(E) = L(E, E) the super algebra of endomorphisms of E. By contrast, the space of
homomorphisms Hom(E, E ′ ) = L(E, E ′ )0̄ consists of only the even linear maps.

2.2. Symmetrization L∞ maps.    Let E = E 0̄ ⊕E 1̄ be a super vector space. TheL            (super) symmet-
ric algebra S(E) = k=0 S (E) is the quotient of the tensor algebra T (E) = ∞
                            k
                                                                                              k=0 E
                                                                                                    ⊗k by the

two-sided ideal generated by all elements of the form v ⊗ w − (−1)         |v||w| w ⊗ v, for homogeneous
elements v, w ∈ E of Z2 -degree |v|, |w|. Both T (E) and S(E) are super algebras, in such a way
that the inclusion of E is a homomorphism of super vector spaces. The tensor algebra T (E) is
characterized by the universal property that any homomorphism of super vector spaces E → A
into a super algebra A extends uniquely to a homomorphism of super algebras T (E) → A; the
symmetric algebra has a similar universal property for commutative super algebras.
   Given a super algebra A, any homomorphism of super vector spaces φ : E → A extends to
S(E) by symmetrization
                                            1 X
        sym(φ) : S(E) → A, v1 · · · vk 7→          (−1)Nσ (v1 ,...,vk ) φ(vσ−1 (1) ) · · · φ(vσ−1 (k) ).
                                           k!
                                                  σ∈Sk

Here Sk is the symmetric group, and Nσ (v1 , . . . , vk ) is the number of pairs i < j such that
vi , vj are odd elements and σ −1 (i) > σ −1 (j).
    Equivalently, the symmetrization map S(E) → A may be characterized as the inclusion
S(E) → T (E) as “symmetric tensors”, followed by the algebra homomorphism T (E) → A
given by the universal property of T (E).

2.3. Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt symmetrization. If (E, [·, ·]E ) is a super Lie algebra, one
defines the enveloping algebra U (E) as the quotient of T (E) by the relations v1 ⊗ v2 −
(−1)|v1 ||v2 | v2 ⊗ v1 − [v1 , v2 ]E . By the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for super Lie algebras
(Corwin-Neeman-Sternberg [11], see also [12]) the symmetrization map S(E) → U (E) is a
linear isomorphism.
   Similarly, if E is a super vector space with a skew-symmetric bi-linear form ω ∈ Hom(E ⊗
E, F) (i.e. ω(v, w) = −(−1)|v||w| ω(w, v)), one defines the Weyl algebra Weyl(E) as the quotient
6                                   A. ALEKSEEV AND E. MEINRENKEN

of the tensor algebra by the ideal generated by elements v ⊗ w − (−1)|v||w| w ⊗ v − ω(v, w).
The corresponding symmetrization map S(E) → Weyl(E) is an isomorphism of super vector
spaces, known as the quantization map for the Weyl algebra. 1 In the purely odd case E 0̄ = 0,
ω is a symmetric bilinear form B on V = E 1̄ (viewed as an ungraded vector space), the Weyl
algebra is the Clifford algebra of (V, B), and the symmetrization map reduces to the Chevalley
quantization map q : ∧V → Cl(V ).
2.4. Derivations. Given a super algebra A we denote by Der(A) ⊂ End(A) the super Lie
algebra of derivations of A. Similarly, if E is a super Lie algebra we denote by Der(E) ⊂ End(E)
the super Lie algebra of derivations of E. For any super vector space E there is a unique
homomorphism of super Lie algebras
                                                                       T (E)
                                  End(E) → Der(T (E)), A 7→ DA
              T (E)                                                              S(E)
such that DA (v) = Av for v ∈ E ⊂ T (E). Similarly one defines DA         ∈ Der(S(E)) and, if
                                                 U (E)
A is a derivation for a super Lie bracket on E, DA     ∈ Der(U (E)). We will need the following
elementary fact.
Lemma 2.1. Let E be a super vector space, A a super algebra, and φ ∈ Hom(E, A) a homomor-
phism of super vector spaces. Suppose we are given a linear map A ∈ End(E) and a derivation
D ∈ Der(A), and that φ intertwines A and D. Then the extended map sym(φ) : S(E) → A
                                         S(E)
obtained by symmetrization intertwines DA ∈ Der(S(E)) and D.
Proof. Recall that sym(φ) factors through the symmetrization map for the tensor algebra
                                                      T (E)
T (E). Since the map T (E) → A intertwines DA                with D, it suffices to prove the Lemma
                         T (E)                  T (E)
for A = T (E), D = D           . The action of DA      on E ⊗k commutes with the action of Sk , as
                                                          T (E)
one easily checks for transpositions. In particular DA          preserves the Sk -invariant subspace.
                             S(E)
It therefore restricts to DA      on S(E) ⊂ T (E).                                                 
2.5. Differential algebras. A differential space (ds) is a super vector space E, together with
a differential, i.e. an odd endomorphism d ∈ End(E)1̄ satisfying d ◦ d = 0. Morphisms in the
category of differential spaces will be called chain maps or ds homomorphisms. The tensor
product E ⊗ E ′ of two differential spaces is a differential space, with d(v ⊗ v ′ ) = dv ⊗ v ′ +
(−1)|v| v ⊗ dv ′ . Algebra objects in this tensor category are called differential algebras (da), Lie
algebra objects are called differential Lie algebras (dl). The discussion from Section 2.4 shows:
Lemma 2.2. Let A be a differential algebra, and φ : E → A a ds homomorphism. Then the
symmetrized map S(E) → A is a ds homomorphism.
   For any differential algebra (A, d), the unit i : F ֒→ A (i.e. the inclusion of F as multiples
of the unit element) is a da homomorphism. By an augmentation map for (A, d), we mean
a da homomorphism π : A → F such that π ◦ i is the identity map. For the tensor algebra,
the natural projections onto F = E ⊗0 is an augmentation map; this descends to augmentation
maps for S(E) and (in the case of a super Lie algebra) U (E).
    1The fact that q is an isomorphism may be deduced from the PBW isomorphism for the Heisenberg Lie
algebra E ⊕ Fc, i.e. the central extension with bracket [v, v ′ ] = ω(v, v ′ )c. Indeed, the symmetrization map
S(E ⊕ Fc) → U (E ⊕ Fc) restricts to an isomorphism between the ideals generated by c − 1, and so the claim
follows by taking quotients by these ideals.

2.6. Koszul algebra. For any vector space V over F, let EV be the ds with EV0̄ = V and
EV1̄ = V , with differential d equal to 0 on even elements and given by the natural isomorphism
EV1̄ → EV0̄ on odd elements. For v ∈ V denote the corresponding even and odd elements in EV
by v ∈ EV0̄ and v ∈ EV1̄ , respectively. Thus
                                        dv = v, dv = 0.
The symmetric algebra S(EV ) is known as the Koszul algebra over V . It is characterized
by the universal property that if A is any commutative da, any vector space homomorphism
V → A1̄ extends to a unique homomorphism of da’s S(EV ) → A. We will also encounter a
non-commutative version of the Koszul algebra, T (EV ). It has a similar universal property, but
in the category of not necessarily commutative da’s A. The non-commutative Koszul algebra
appears in a paper of Gelfand-Smirnov [17].
   For any Lie algebra g, we denote by e
                                       g the super Lie algebra
                                            e
                                            g=g⋉g
(semi-direct product) where the even part e   g0̄ = g acts on the odd part e
                                                                           g1̄ = g by the adjoint
representation. It is a differential Lie algebra under the identification e
                                                                          g = Eg: that is, d is a
derivation for the Lie bracket.
2.7. g-differential spaces. A g-differential space (g−ds) is a differential space (E, d) together
with a dl homomorphism, e g → End(E). That is, it consists of a representation of the super
            g on E, where the operators ιξ , Lξ ∈ End(E) corresponding to ξ, ξ ∈ e
Lie algebra e                                                                       g satisfy the
relations
(3)                                 [d, ιξ ] = Lξ , [d, Lξ ] = 0.
The operators ιξ are called contractions, the operators Lξ are called Lie derivatives. The tensor
product of any two g − ds, taking the tensor product of the e g-representations, is again a g − ds.
Hence g − ds’s form an F-linear tensor category; the algebra objects in this tensor category
are called g-differential algebras (g − da), the Lie algebra objects are called g-differential Lie
algebras (g − dl). This simply means that the representation should act by derivations of the
product respectively Lie bracket.                                 T
   For any
        T g − ds E, one defines the horizontal subspace Ehor = ker ιξ , the invariant subspace
Einv = ker Lξ , and the basic subspace Ebasic = Ehor ∩ Einv . That is, Ebasic is the space of
fixed vectors for e
                  g. This subspace is stable under d, hence is a differential space. Any g − ds
homomorphism φ : E → E ′ restricts to a chain map between basic subspaces.
   An example of a g − dl is E = e   g with the adjoint action. Another example is obtained by
adjoining d as an odd element, defining a semi-direct product
(4)                                           Fd ⋉ e
                                                   g
where the action of d on eg is as the differential, dξ = ξ, dξ = 0. (Note that a g − ds can be
defined equivalently as a module for the super Lie algebra (4); this is the point of view taken
in the book [18].) The symmetric and tensor algebras over a g − ds E are g − da’s, and Lemma
2.1 shows:
Lemma 2.3. If A is a g − da, and φ : E → A is a g − ds homomorphism, then the sym-
metrization sym(φ) : S(E) → A is a g − ds homomorphism.

2.8. Homotopy operators. The space L(E, E ′ ) of linear maps φ : E → E ′ between differ-
ential spaces is itself a differential space, with differential d(φ) = d ◦ φ − (−1)|φ| φ ◦ d. Chain
maps correspond to cocycles in L(E, E ′ )0̄ .
   A homotopy operator between two chain maps φ0 , φ1 : E → E ′ is an odd linear map
h ∈ L(E, E ′ )1̄ such that d(h) = φ0 − φ1 . A homotopy inverse to a chain map φ : E → E ′ is a
chain map ψ : E ′ → E such that φ ◦ ψ and ψ ◦ φ are homotopic to the identity maps of E ′ , E.
Lemma 2.4. Let (E, d) be a differential space, and suppose there exists s ∈ End(E)1̄ with
[d, s] = idE . Then the inclusion i : F → T (E) and the augmentation map π : T (E) → F are
homotopy inverses. Similarly for the symmetric algebra.
Proof. The derivation extension of [d, s] to T (E) is the Euler operator on T (E), equal to k on
E ⊗k . Hence [d, s] + i ◦ π ∈ End(E)0̄ is an invertible chain map, and the calculation
                    I − i ◦ π = [d, s]([d, s] + i ◦ π)−1 = [d, s([d, s] + i ◦ π)−1 ]
shows that h = s([d, s] + i ◦ π)−1 ∈ End(E)1̄ is a homotopy operator between I and i ◦ π. The
proof for the symmetric algebra is similar.                                                
   The Lemma shows that the Koszul algebra S(EV ) and its non-commutative version T (EV )
have trivial cohomology, since s ∈ End(EV )1̄ given by s(v) = v and s(v) = 0 has the desired
properties. We will refer to the corresponding h as the standard homotopy operator for the
Koszul algebra.
   More generally, if E, E ′ are g − ds then the space L(E, E ′ ) inherits the structure of a g − ds,
with contractions ιξ (φ) = ιξ ◦ φ − (−1)|φ| φ ◦ ιξ and Lie derivatives Lξ (φ) = Lξ ◦ φ − φ ◦ Lξ .
g − ds homomorphisms E → E ′ are exactly the cocycles in L(E, E ′ )0̄basic . A homotopy between
two g − ds homomorphisms φ0 , φ1 : E → E ′ is called a g-homotopy if it is e    g-equivariant. Note
                                                                   ′
that any such h restricts to a homotopy of φ0 , φ1 : Ebasic → Ebasic   .
2.9. Connection and curvature. A connection on a g − da A is a linear map θ : g∗ → A1̄
with the properties,
                           ιξ (θ(µ)) = µ(ξ), Lξ (θ(µ)) = −θ(ad∗ξ µ).
A g − da admitting a connection is called locally free. The curvature of a connection θ is the
linear map F θ : g∗ → A0̄ defined by
                                         F θ = dθ + 21 [θ, θ].
                                                     θ⊗θ
Here [θ, θ] denotes the composition g∗ → g∗ ⊗ g∗ −→ A1̄ ⊗ A1̄ → A0̄ , where the first map is the
map dual to the Lie bracket and the last map is algebra multiplication. The curvature map is
equivariant and satisfies ιξ F θ = 0.
  The following equivalent definition of a connection will be useful in what follows. Let Fc
be the 1-dimensional space spanned by an even generator c, viewed as a differential space on
which d acts trivially, and consider the direct sum Eg∗ ⊕ Fc with e
                                                                  g-action given by
(5)               Lξ µ = −ad∗ξ µ, Lξ µ = − ad∗ξ µ, ιξ µ = − ad∗ξ µ, ιξ µ = µ(ξ)c.
Then, a connection on a g − da A is equivalent to a g − ds homomorphism
(6)                                        Eg∗ ⊕ Fc → A
taking c to the unit of A.

Remark 2.5. It may be verified that Eg∗ ⊕ Fc is the odd dual space of the super Lie algebra
Fd ⋉ e
     g, i.e. the dual space with the opposite Z2 -grading.

                           3. The Chern-Weil homomorphism
3.1. The Weil algebra. The Weil algebra W g is a commutative g − da with connection
g∗ → W g, with the following universal property: For any commutative g−da A with connection
θ : g∗ → A, there exists a unique g − da homomorphism cθ : W g → A such that the following
diagram commutes:
                                          WO g θ /> A
                                                c   }}
                                                 }}}
                                                }
                                              }} θ
                                         g∗
We will refer to cθ as the characteristic homomorphism for the connection θ. The Weil algebra
is explicitly given as a quotient
(7)                            W g = S(Eg∗ ⊕ Fc)/ < c − 1 >,
where < c − 1 > denotes the two-sided ideal generated by c − 1. From the description (6) of
connections, it is obvious that W g carries a “tautological” connection. If A is commutative,
the homomorphism (6) extends, by the universal property of the symmetric algebra, to a g − da
homomorphism
(8)                                   S(Eg∗ ⊕ Fc) → A
This homomorphism takes < c − 1 > to 0, and therefore descends to a g − da homomorphism
cθ : W g → A. If A is a non-commutative g − da with connection θ, the map (8) is still
well-defined, using symmetrization. Hence one obtains a canonical g − ds homomorphism
(9)                                     cθ : W g → A
even in the non-commutative case. Of course, (9) is no longer an algebra homomorphism in
general. What we will show below is that (9) is an algebra homomorphism “up to g-homotopy”.
  As a differential algebra, the Weil algebra is just the Koszul algebra W g = S(Eg∗ ). The
g − da-structure is given on generators µ, µ by formulas similar to (5), with c replaced by 1,
and the connection is the map sending µ ∈ g∗ to the corresponding odd generator of W g. The
curvature map for this connection is given by
                              F : g∗ → W g, µ 7→ µ
                                                 b := µ − λ(µ)
where
                      λ : g∗ → ∧2 g∗ , ιξ λ(µ) = − ad∗ξ µ, ξ ∈ g, µ ∈ g∗
is the map dual to the Lie bracket, and we identify ∧g∗ as the subalgebra of W g defined by
                              b = 0 since the curvature of a connection is horizontal. The
the odd generators. Recall ιξ µ
curvature map extends to an algebra homomorphism Sg∗ → (W g)hor , which is easily seen to
be an isomorphism. Thus
(10)                                  W g = Sg∗ ⊗ ∧g∗ ,
10                               A. ALEKSEEV AND E. MEINRENKEN

where Sg∗ ∼                                                      b, and the exterior algebra
           = (W g)hor is generated by the “curvature variables ” µ
∧g∗ by the “connection variables” µ. The Weil differential vanishes on (W g)basic = (Sg∗ )inv ;
hence the cohomology of the basic subcomplex coincides with (Sg∗ )inv .
Remark 3.1. Let W̃ g be the non-commutative g − da, defined similar to (7) but with the tensor
algebra in place of the symmetric algebra,
                                 W̃ g = T (Eg∗ ⊕ Fc)/ < c − 1 > .
Then W̃ g has a universal property similar to W g among non-commutative g − da’s with con-
nection. As a differential algebra, W̃ g is the non-commutative Koszul algebra, W̃ g = T (Eg∗ ).
In particular, it is acyclic, with a canonical homotopy operator.
3.2. The rigidity property of the Weil algebra. The algebraic version of the Chern-Weil
theorem asserts that if A is a commutative locally free g−da, the characteristic homomorphisms
corresponding to any two connections on A are g-homotopic (see e.g. [18]). This then implies
that the induced map (Sg∗ )inv → H(Abasic ) is independent of the choice of connection. The
following result generalizes the Chern-Weil theorem to the non-commutative setting:
Theorem 3.2 (Rigidity Property). Let A be a locally free g − da. Any two g − ds homomor-
phisms c0 , c1 : W g → A that agree on the unit of W g are g-homotopic.
  The proof will be given in Section 3.3. We stress that the maps ci need not be algebra
homomorphism, and are not necessarily characteristic homomorphism for connections on A.
The rigidity theorem implies the following surprising result.
Corollary 3.3. Let A be a locally free g − da and c : W g → A be a g − ds homomorphism
taking the unit of W g to the unit of A. Then the induced map in basic cohomology
(11)                                   (Sg∗ )inv → H(Abasic )
is an algebra homomorphism, independent of the choice of c.
     In particular, Corollary 3.3 applies to characteristic homomorphisms cθ for connections θ on
A.
Proof. By Theorem 3.2, the map (11) is independent of c. Given w′ ∈ (W g)basic = (Sg∗ )inv ,
the two g − ds homomorphisms
                             W g → A, w 7→ c(ww′ ),    w 7→ c(w)c(w′ ).
agree on the unit of W g, and are therefore g-homotopic. Hence [c(ww′ )] = [c(w)c(w′ )] =
[c(w)] [c(w′ )] so that (11) is an algebra homomorphism.                                
Remark 3.4. Theorem 3.2 becomes false, in general, if one drops the assumption that A is
locally free. To construct a counter-example, let A0 and A1 be two Z-graded locally free
g − da’s with characteristic maps ci for some choice of connections. Assume that there is an
element p ∈ (S k g∗ )inv with k ≥ 2 such that c0 (p) 6= 0 while c1 (p) = 0. (For instance, one can
choose A0 = W g, and A1 = ∧g∗ the quotient of W g by the ideal generated by the universal
curvatures. Then the assumption holds for any element p of degree k ≥ 2, taking ci to be the
characteristic maps for the canonical connections.) Let E = (A0 ⊕ A1 )/V , where V is the one
dimensional subspace spanned by (1A0 − 1A1 ). View E as an algebra with zero product, and
define a g − da A = F ⊕ E by adjoining a unit. The maps ci descend to g − ds homomorphisms

c̃i : W g → E ⊂ A that agree on 1W g, while c̃0 (p) 6= 0 and c̃1 (p) = 0. Hence, c̃i are not
g-homotopic.
3.3. Proof of Theorem 3.2. The proof of Theorem 3.2 will be based on the following two
observations.
   (a) The Weil algebra W g fits into a family of g-differential algebras S(Eg∗ ⊕ Fc)/ < c − t >
       for t ∈ F. As differential algebras, these are all identified with S(Eg∗ ). The formulas
       for the Lie derivatives Lξ are the same as for W g, while the contraction operators for
       the deformed algebras read
                                    ιtξ µ = − ad∗ξ µ, ιtξ µ = thµ, ξi.
       It is clear that the resulting g − da’s for t 6= 0 are all isomorphic to W g, by a simple
       rescaling. However, for t = 0 one obtains a non-isomorphic g − da which may be identi-
       fied with the symmetric algebra over the space Eg∗ with the co-adjoint representation
       of e
          g. The standard homotopy operator h for S(Eg∗ ) becomes a g-homotopy operator
       exactly for t = 0.
   (b) S(Eg∗ ) is a super Hopf algebra, with co-multiplication ∆ : S(Eg∗ ) → S(Eg∗ ) ⊗ S(Eg∗ )
       induced by the diagonal embedding Eg∗ → Eg∗ ⊕ Eg∗ , and co-unit the augmentation
       map π : S(Eg∗ ) → F. Both d and Lξ are co-derivations for this co-product. For the
       contraction operators ιtξ one finds,
                                ∆ ◦ ιtξ1 +t2 = (ιtξ1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ιtξ2 ) ◦ ∆,
       in particular, ιtξ is a co-derivation only for t = 0.
Proof of Theorem 3.2. View the space L(W g, A) of linear maps as a g − ds, as in Section 2.8.
We have to show that if c : W g → A is a g−ds homomorphism with c(1) = 0, then c = d(ψ) for
a basic element ψ ∈ L(W g, A). Letting h be the standard homotopy operator for W g = S(Eg∗ ),
the composition c ◦ h satisfies d(c ◦ h) = c, however, it is not basic since h is not a g-homotopy.
   To get around this problem, we will exploit that the space L(W g, A) has an algebra structure,
using the co-multiplication ∆ on W g and the co-unit π : W g → F. The product of two maps
φ1 , φ2 : W g → A is given by the composition
                                           ∆                  φ1 ⊗φ2
                         φ1 · φ2 : W g −→ W g ⊗ W g −→ A ⊗ A → A,
and the unit element in L(W g, A) is the composition
                                       1L := iA ◦ π : W g → A,
where iA : F → A is the unit for the algebra A. The deformed contraction operators ιtξ on W g
induce deformations of the contraction operators for L(W g, A), denoted by the same symbol.
The formula in (b) implies that
(12)                    ιtξ1 +t2 (φ1 · φ2 ) = (ιtξ1 φ1 ) · φ2 + (−1)|φ1 | φ1 · ιtξ2 φ2 .
The sum φ = 1L + c is a g − ds homomorphism taking the unit in W g to the unit in A.
Since c ◦ iW g = 0, φ is anPinvertible element of the algebra L(W g, A), with inverse given as
a geometric series φ−1 = N (−1)N cN . The series is well-defined, since c is locally nilpotent:
Indeed, cN vanishes on S j (Eg∗ ) for N > j.

   Since ι1ξ (φ) = 0 the inverse satisfies ι−1  −1
                                            ξ (φ ) = 0; this follows from (12) since the unit element
1L ∈ L(W g, A) is annihilated by ι0ξ . Hence, the product c · φ−1 ∈ L(W g, A) is annihilated by
d, Lξ , ι0ξ . We now set,
                                   ψ := ((c · φ−1 ) ◦ h) · φ.
Recall that h is a g-homotopy operator with respect to the contraction operators ι0ξ . Hence
                     ι1ξ (ψ) = (ι0ξ ((c · φ−1 ) ◦ h)) · φ − ((c · φ−1 ) ◦ h) · ι1ξ φ = 0.
On the other hand, using c ◦ iW g = 0 we have
              d(((c · φ−1 ) ◦ h) = (c · φ−1 ) ◦ d(h) = (c · φ−1 ) ◦ (id −i ◦ π) = c · φ−1
and therefore d(ψ) = c. Since obviously Lξ (ψ) = 0, the proof is complete.                         
Remark 3.5. The homotopy ψ constructed above vanishes on the unit of W g. This property
is implied by h(1) = 0 and ∆(1) = 1 ⊗ 1.
3.4. g-differential algebras of Weil type. In this Section we will prove a more precise
version of Corollary 3.3. In particular, we will describe a class of locally free g − da’s of Weil
type for which the algebra homomorphism (11) is in fact an isomorphism. The results will not
be needed for most of our applications, except in Sections 8.4 and 9.
Definition 3.6. Let W be a locally free g − da, together with a ds homomorphism π : W → F
such that π ◦ i = id, where i : F → W is the unit for W . Then W will be called of Weil type if
there exists a homotopy operator h between i ◦ π and id, with h ◦ i = 0, such that [Lξ , h] = 0
and such that h and all ιξ have degree < 0 with respect to some filtration
                                    [
                               W =     W (N ) , W (0) ⊂ W (1) ⊂ · · ·
                                       N ≥0

of W .
   The definition is motivated by ideas from Guillemin-Sternberg L     [18, Section 4.3]. In most
examples, the Z2 -grading on W is induced from a Z-grading W = n≥0 W n , F ⊂ W 0 , with d
of degree +1, Lξ of degree 0 and and ιξ of degree −1. If a homotopy operator h with [Lξ , h] = 0
exists, its part of degree −1 is still a homotopy operator, and has the required properties. (Note
that compatibility of the grading with the algebra structure is not needed.) In particular, the
Weil algebra W g and its non-commutative version W̃ g from Remark 3.1 are of Weil type. The
tensor product of two g − da’s of Weil type is again of Weil type. In the following Sections we
will encounter several other examples.
Theorem 3.7. Suppose W, W ′ are g − da’s of Weil type. Then there exists a g − ds homo-
morphism φ : W → W ′ taking the unit in W to the unit in W ′ . Moreover, any such φ is a
g-homotopy equivalence.
   It follows that all g − da’s of Weil type are g-homotopy equivalent. The proof of Theorem
3.7 is somewhat technical, and is therefore deferred to the appendix.
   By Theorem 3.7, many of the usual properties of W g extend to g − da’s of Weil type. For
instance, since the basic cohomology of W g is (Sg∗ )inv , the same is true for any g − da of Weil
type:

Corollary 3.8. If A = W is a g − da of Weil type the Chern-Weil map (Sg∗ )inv → H(Abasic )
is an algebra isomorphism.
Corollary 3.9. Let W be a g − da of Weil type and A be a locally free g − da.
  (a) There is a g − ds homomorphism φ : W → A taking the unit in W to the unit in A.
      The induced map in basic cohomology is an algebra homomorphism.
  (b) Any two g − ds homomorphisms φ : W → A that agree on the unit element of W are
      g-homotopic.
Proof. Both facts have already been established for W = W g. Hence, by Theorem 3.7 they
extend to arbitrary g − da’s of Weil type.                                           
Corollary 3.10. The symmetrization map W g → W̃ g is a g-homotopy equivalence, with g-
homotopy inverse the quotient map W̃ g → W g.
Proof. The composition W̃ g → W g → W̃ g is a g − ds homomorphism taking units to units,
hence is g-homotopic to the identity map.                                             
Corollary 3.11. Let W be of Weil type, and A a locally free g − da. Let φ : W → A be
a g − ds homomorphism taking units to units. Then φ induces an algebra homomorphism
in basic cohomology. More precisely, it intertwines the products mW : W ⊗ W → W and
mA : A ⊗ A → A up to g-chain homotopy.
Proof. The assertion is that the two maps W ⊗ W → A given by mA ◦ (φ ⊗ φ) and φ ◦ mW are
g-homotopic. But this follows because W ⊗ W is a g − da of Weil type, and each of the two
maps are g − ds homomorphisms that agree on the unit.                                   
Remark 3.12. The statement of Corollary 3.11 may be strengthened to the fact that φ is an
A∞ -morphism ( see e.g. [32] for a precise definition). Thus φ = φ(1) is the first term in a
            g-equivariant maps φ(n) : W ⊗n → A. The second term φ(2) = ψ is the g-homotopy
sequence of e
between the two maps W ⊗ W → A given by mA ⊗ (φ ⊗ φ) and φ ⊗ mW . To construct φ(3) ,
note that the two maps W ⊗3 → A,
                  mA ◦ (ψ ⊗ φ) + ψ ◦ (mW ⊗ 1),      mA (φ ⊗ ψ) + ψ(1 ⊗ mW )
are g−ds-homomorphisms. Since ψ vanishes on the unit of W ⊗2 (cf. Remark 3.5), both of these
maps vanish at the unit of W ⊗3 . It follows that there exists a g-homotopy φ(3) : W ⊗3 → A
between these two maps, which again vanishes at the unit. Proceeding in this manner, one
constructs the higher g-homotopies.

                                4. The Weil algebra Wg.
  In this Section we construct, for any quadratic Lie algebra g, an interesting non-commutative
g − da of Weil type.
4.1. Quadratic Lie algebras. We begin by recalling some examples and facts about quadratic
Lie algebras. From now on, we will refer to any non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on a
vector space as a scalar product. A Lie algebra g with invariant scalar product B will be called
a quadratic Lie algebra. First examples of quadratic Lie algebras are semi-simple Lie algebras,
with B the Killing form. Here are some other examples:
14                                 A. ALEKSEEV AND E. MEINRENKEN

Examples 4.1.     (a) Let g be any Lie algebra, with given symmetric bilinear form. Then the
      radical r of the bilinear form is an ideal, and the quotient g/r with induced bilinear
      form is quadratic.
  (b) Let F2n be equipped with the standard symplectic form, ω(e2i−1 , e2i ) = 1. Recall that
      the Heisenberg Lie algebra Hn is the central extension
                                        0 −→ F −→ Hn −→ F2n
         of the Abelian Lie algebra F2n by F, with bracket defined by the cocycle ω. Let c denote
         the basis vector for the center F ⊂ Hn . Let another copy of F, with basis vector r, act
         on F2n by infinitesimal rotation in each e2i−1 –e2i -plane: r.e2i−1 = e2i , r.e2i = −e2i−1 .
         This action lifts to derivations of Hn , and we may form the semi-direct product
                                                g = F ⋉ Hn .
         The Lie algebra g is quadratic, with bilinear form given by B(e2i−1 , e2i ) = B(c, r) = 1,
         and all other scalar products between basis vectors equal to 0.
     (c) Let s be any Lie algebra, acting on its dual by the co-adjoint action. Viewing s∗ as an
         Abelian Lie algebra, form the semi-direct product g = s ⋉ s∗ . Then g is a quadratic
         Lie algebra, with bilinear form B given by the natural pairing between s and s∗ . More
         generally, given an invariant element C ∈ (∧3 s)s−inv , one obtains a quadratic Lie algebra
         where the bracket between elements of s∗ is given by [µ, µ′ ]g = C(µ, µ′ , ·) ∈ s. See
         Section 8.2 below.
   From a given quadratic Lie algebra (a, Ba), new examples are obtained by the double exten-
sion construction of Medina-Revoy [34]: Suppose a second Lie algebra s acts on a by derivations
preserving the scalar product. Let ω be the following s∗ -valued cocycle on a,
                             hω(a1 , a2 ), ξi = Ba(a1 , ξ.a2 ), ai ∈ a, ξ ∈ s
and a ⊕ s∗ the central extension of a defined by this cocycle. The Lie algebra s acts on a ⊕ s∗
by derivations, hence we may form the semi-direct product g = s ⋉ (a ⊕ s∗ ). The given scalar
product on a, together with the scalar product on s ⋉ s∗ given by the pairing, define a scalar
product on g, which is easily checked to be invariant. Notice that Example 4.1(b) is a special
case of this construction.

4.2. The algebra Wg. Consider the following example of the double extension construction
(extended to super Lie algebras in the obvious way). Suppose g is any Lie algebra with a
(possibly degenerate) symmetric bilinear form B. Then the super Lie algebra e
                                                                            g inherits an odd
(!) symmetric bilinear form,
                                                                         ′
                   Beg(ξ, ξ ′ ) = 0, Beg(ξ, ξ ′ ) = B(ξ, ξ ′ ), Beg(ξ, ξ ) = 0,   ξ, ξ ′ ∈ g.
The action of s = Fd given by the differential on e
                                                  g preserves Beg. The corresponding cocycle
ω: eg⊗e g → F is given by B on the odd part eg1̄ = g and vanishes on the even part. Thus, we
obtain a central extension e
                           g ⊕ Fc by an even generator c dual to d; the new brackets between
odd generators read,
                                          [ζ, ζ ′ ]eg⊕Fc = B(ζ, ζ ′ )c
                        LIE THEORY AND THE CHERN-WEIL HOMOMORPHISM                                     15

while the brackets between even generators or between even and odd generators are unchanged.
The second step of the double extension constructs the super Lie algebra
(13)                                         Fd ⋉ (e
                                                   g ⊕ Fc),
together with an odd symmetric bilinear form. The latter is non-degenerate if and only if B is
non-degenerate.
  The super Lie algebra (13) is a g − dl, where Fd ⋉ e  g acts by inner derivations. It contains
the central extension e
                      g ⊕ Fc as a g-differential Lie subalgebra. Explicitly, the g − ds structure
on e
   g ⊕ Fc is given by
                   Lξ ζ = [ξ, ζ]g, Lξ ζ = [ξ, ζ]g, ιξ ζ = [ξ, ζ]g, ιξ ζ = B(ξ, ζ)c,
while ιξ , Lξ vanish on c.
Remark 4.2. It is instructive to compare the definition of the super Lie algebra (13) to the
standard construction of affine Lie algebras. Let g be a Lie algebra with invariant symmetric
bilinear form B. Tensoring with Laurent polynomials, define an infinite dimensional Lie algebra
g[z, z −1 ] = g ⊗ F[z, z −1 ] with bilinear form B ′ (x1 ⊗ f1 , x2 ⊗ f2 ) = B(x1 , x2 ) Res(f1 f2 ) where
the residue Res picks the coefficient of z −1 . The derivation ∂(x ⊗ f ) = x ⊗ ∂f /∂z preserves
the bilinear form since Res(∂f /∂z) = 0. The double extension of g[z, z −1 ] with respect to the
derivation ∂ is called an affine Lie algebra (at least if B is non-degenerate). In a similar fashion,
letting u be an odd variable we may tensor with the algebra F[u] = {a + bu| a, b ∈ F} to define
g[u] = g ⊗ F[u]. It carries an odd symmetric bilinear form, defined similar to B ′ but with Res
replaced by the Berezin integral Ber(a + bu) = b. Again, the derivation d(x ⊗ f ) = x ⊗ ∂f /∂u
preserves the inner product since Ber(∂f /∂u) = 0. Then g[u] ∼            = e
                                                                            g, the derivation d is the
Koszul differential, and the double extension yields (13).
   The two constructions may be unified to define a super Lie algebra g[z, z −1 , u] known as
super-affinization, see [21].
  We define the g − da Wg as a quotient of the enveloping algebra,
(14)                                         g ⊕ Fc)/ < c − 1 > .
                                    Wg := U (e
Note that Wg can be defined directly as a quotient of the tensor algebra T (e            g), in terms of
                                            ′
generators ξ, ξ (ξ ∈ g) with relations [ξ, ξ ] = [ξ, ξ ]g, [ξ, ξ ] = [ξ, ξ ]g and [ξ, ξ ] = B(ξ, ξ ′ ). In
                                                      ′         ′         ′            ′

particular there is a symmetrization map S(e   g) → Wg. Let S(e     g) carry the structure of a g − da,
                                     g ⊕ Fc)/ < c − 1 >.
induced by its identification with S(e
Lemma 4.3. The symmetrization map
(15)                                       Qg : S(e
                                                  g) → Wg
is a g − ds isomorphism.
Proof. By Lemma 2.3, the PBW isomorphism S(e     g ⊕ Fc) → U (e
                                                              g ⊕ Fc) is a g − ds isomorphism.
After quotienting the ideal < c − 1 > on both sides, the Lemma follows.                     
Proposition 4.4. If B = 0, the inclusion map F ֒→ Wg is a g-homotopy equivalence.
Proof. It suffices to show that the inclusion F ֒→ S(e  g) is a g-homotopy equivalence. Since
B = 0, e g (not just e
                     g ⊕ Fc) is a g − ds, and the map s : e  g→e  g (cf. the end of Section 2.8)
entering the definition of Koszul homotopy operator h : S(e     g) → S(e  g) commutes with Lie
derivatives and contractions. It follows that h is a g-homotopy in this case.                 
16                                A. ALEKSEEV AND E. MEINRENKEN

4.3. The non-degenerate case. Let us now assume that g is a quadratic Lie algebra, i.e.
that the bilinear B on g is non-degenerate. In this case, Wg becomes a g − da of Weil type.
Indeed, the scalar product B defines an isomorphism B ♯ : g∗ → g, and hence Eg∗ ∼ = Eg = e  g.
This isomorphism identifies the g − ds structures on Eg∗ ⊕ Fc and eg ⊕ Fc, hence it identifies
S(eg) with the Weil algebra W g = S(Eg∗ ). That is, for any invariant scalar product B, (15)
becomes a g − ds isomorphism
(16)                                    Qg : W g → Wg.
Since W g is of Weil type, so is Wg. We will refer to Qg as the quantization map.
Remark 4.5. On the subalgebras ∧g ⊂ W g resp. Cl(g) ⊂ Wg generated by odd elements ζ,
the quantization map restricts to the usual quantization map (Chevalley symmetrization map)
                                         q : ∧g → Cl(g)
for Clifford algebras, while on the subalgebras generated by even elements ζ it becomes the
PBW symmetrization map Sg → U g.
Remark 4.6. The Weil algebra Wg carries a connection g∗ ∼    = g → Wg, induced from the inclu-
            g1̄ . By construction, the quantization map (16) is the characteristic homomorphism
sion of g = e
for this connection.
   As mentioned above, the horizontal subalgebra (W g)hor of the Weil algebra W g is isomorphic
to the symmetric algebra, and the differential d vanishes on (W g)basic = (Sg∗ )inv . We will now
show that similarly, the horizontal subalgebra (Wg)hor is g-equivariantly isomorphic to the
enveloping algebra U g. Let γ : g → Cl(g) be the map,
                                               X
                                    γ(ζ) = 12     [ζ, ea ]gea
                                                 a
where ea is a basis of g and ea the dual basis with respect to the given scalar product. It is a
standard fact that the map γ is a Lie algebra homomorphism, and that Clifford commutator
with γ(ζ) is the generator for the adjoint action of ζ on the Clifford algebra:
                                                      Cl(g)
                                         [γ(ζ), ·] = Lζ
where the bracket denotes the super commutator in the Clifford algebra. Recall the definition
of the map λ : g∗ → ∧2 g∗ by ιξ λ(µ) = − ad∗ξ µ. Identify g∗ ∼
                                                             = g by means of the scalar product,
and let q : ∧g → Cl(g) the quantization map (i.e. symmetrization map) for the Clifford algebra.
Then
                                        γ(ζ) = q(λ(ζ)).
The curvature of the canonical connection on Wg is the map
                               g → (Wg)hor , ζ 7→ ζb = ζ − γ(ζ).
Theorem 4.7. The super algebra Wg is a tensor product
(17)                                    Wg = U g ⊗ Cl(g)
where U g is generated by the even variables ζb and the Clifford algebra Cl(g) is generated by the
odd variables ζ. Under this identification, the map Qg : W g → Wg restricts to a vector space
                       LIE THEORY AND THE CHERN-WEIL HOMOMORPHISM                                 17

isomorphism
(18)                                 Sg = (W g)hor → U g = (Wg)hor .
In fact, (18) is an algebra isomorphism on g-invariants.
Proof. The elements ζb ∈ Wg are the images of the corresponding elements in W g (denoted
by the same symbol) under the quantization map Qg. The commutator of two such elements
b ζb′ ∈ Wg is given by
ζ,
                   [ζ,                                                               \
                    b ζb′ ] = [ζ, ζ ′ ]g − Lζ γ(ζ ′ ) − Lζ ′ γ(ζ) + γ([ζ, ζ ′ ]g) = [ζ, ζ ′ ]g.
Hence the variables ζb generate a copy of the enveloping algebra U g ⊂ Wg. On the other hand,
the odd variables ζ generate a copy of the Clifford algebra. Since [ζ, ζb′ ] = 0 for ζ, ζ ′ ∈ g, the
decomposition (17) follows. Since the map Qg : W g → Wg is a g − ds isomorphism, and
the Weil differential d vanishes on basic elements in W g, it also vanishes on (Wg)basic . Hence
H((Wg)basic ) = (Wg)basic = (U g)inv , and the last claim of the Theorem follows from Corollary
3.3.                                                                                              

                                        5. Duflo isomorphism
   We will now show that the isomorphism (18) from Sg to U g is exactly the Duflo isomorphism,
for the case of quadratic Lie algebras. Thus Theorem 4.7 proves Duflo’s theorem for this case.
More generally, we will show that the map Qg : W g → Wg coincides with the quantization
map introduced in [1].
Proposition 5.1. Each of the derivations ιξ , d, Lξ of Wg is inner.
Proof. By construction, ιξ = [ξ, ·] and Lξ = [ξ, ·]. To show that the differential
                                                                             P     d is inner,
choose a basis ea of g, and let ea be the dual basis with respect to B. Then a ea ea ∈ Wg is
an invariant element, independent of the choice of basis. We have

   (b) The fact that the derivation d is inner may also be formulated in terms of the quadratic
        super Lie algebra Fd ⋉ (eg ⊕ Fc). Indeed, it may be verified that the cubic element

        see that d − D is central in the quotient by < c − 1 >.
                                                                         `
   We now recall the definition of the Duflo map Sg → U g. Let Sg∗ = ∞           k ∗
                                                                           k=0 S g be the com-
pletion of the symmetric algebra, or equivalently the algebraic dual space to Sg. Informally, we
will view Sg∗ as Taylor series expansions of functions on g. There is an algebra homomorphism
                                     Sg∗ → End(Sg), F 7→ Fb
extending the natural action of g∗ by derivations, that is, F̂ is an infinite order differential
operator acting on polynomials. Let j(z) = sinh(z/2)
                                              z/2    and define J ∈ Sg∗ by
                                                                  
                            J(ξ) = det(j(adξ )) = etr (ln j)(adξ ) .
The square root of J is a well-defined element of Sg∗ . The Duflo map is the composition
(19)                                 symU g ◦Jd
                                              1/2 : Sg → U g.

The quantization map in [1] is an extension of the Duflo map, for the case that g is quadratic.
Write W g = Sg ⊗ ∧g, as in (10), and Wg = U g ⊗ Cl(g) as in (17). Let
                                                   1    z 1
                                      (ln j)′ (z) = coth −

be the logarithmic derivative of the function j, and let r ∈ Sg∗ ⊗ ∧2 g be given by r(ξ) =
(ln j)′ (adξ ), where we identify skew-symmetric operators on g with elements in ∧2 g. Put
                                     S(ξ) = J 1/2 (ξ) exp(r(ξ))
         d ∈ End(W g) denote the corresponding operator, where the Sg∗ factor acts as
and let ι(S)
an infinite order differential operator on Sg, and the ∧g factor acts by contraction on ∧g.
Let q : ∧g → Cl(g) be the Chevalley quantization map for the Clifford algebra. The tensor
product of the PBW symmetrization map symU g : Sg → U g and the Chevalley quantization
map q : ∧g → Cl(g) define a linear isomorphism symU g ⊗q : W g → Wg. Put differently, this
                                                            b rather than the generators ξ, ξ
is the symmetrization map with respect to the generators ξ, ξ,
used in the definition of Qg.
Theorem 5.3. Under the identification W g = Sg ⊗ ∧g and Wg = U g ⊗ Cl(g), the quantization
map is given by the formula,
                                                  d : W g → Wg.
                             Qg = (symU g ⊗ q) ◦ ι(S)
In particular, its restriction to the symmetric algebra Sg is the Duflo map.
Proof. We use an alternative description of the symmetrization map S(e           g). Let ν a ∈ Eg1̄∗
                                                                         g) → T (e
and µa ∈ Eg0̄∗ be “parameters”. The symmetrizationP map is characterized by its property that
for all p, the map id ⊗Qg takes the pth power of a (ν a ea + µa ea ) in the algebra S(Eg∗ ) ⊗ W g

to the corresponding pth power in S(Eg∗ ) ⊗ Wg. These conditions may be combined into a
single condition

here the exponentials are well-defined in completions S(Eg∗ ) ⊗ W g and S(Eg∗ ) ⊗ Wg, respec-
tively.
   We want to re-express the symmetrization map in terms of the new generators ea , eba =
ea − λ(ea ) of W g and ea , eba = ea − γ(ea ) of Wg. Using that ea and eba commute in Wg, we
may separate the Cl(g) and U g-variables in the exponential and obtain:

         expWg(        (ν a ea + µa ea )) = expCl(g)      (ν a ea + µa γ(ea ) expU g(      µa eba ).

The factor expU g( a µa eba ) is the image of expSg( a µa eba ) under the symmetrization map
symU g : Sg → U g. The other factor is the exponential of a quadratic expression in the
Clifford algebra. Using [3, Theorem 2.1] such exponentials may be expressed in terms of the
corresponding exponentials in the exterior algebra:

  A different proof of Theorem 5.3 will be given in Section 8. Our result shows that while
the Duflo map itself is not a symmetrization map, it may be viewed as the restriction of a
symmetrization map for a larger algebra. Using Theorem 5.3, we obtain a very simple proof of
the following result from [1, 25]:
Proposition 5.4. The square of the cubic element D is given by
                                        1       1

                      ba
where Casg = a eba e ∈ (U g)inv ⊂ Wg is the quadratic Casimir element, and trg(Casg) its
trace in the adjoint representation.
Outline of proof. Write D = Qg(D) as in Remark 5.2 (a). Then
                                                                    X

                                                                         a

Using the explicit formula (19) for the Duflo map, one finds that Qg( a eba eba ) is equal to

Casg + 24 trg(Casg).                                                                       

Remarks 5.5.      (a) The algebra Wg carries a natural Z-filtration, where the odd generators
      have degree 1 and the even generators have degree 2. Its associated graded algebra is
      the Weil algebra W g, with its standard grading. The filtration on Wg is compatible
      with the Z2 -grading in the sense of [27], and therefore induces the structure of a graded
      Poisson algebra on W g. On generators, the formulas for the graded Poisson bracket are
      given by {ξ, ζ} = B(ξ, ζ), {ξ, ζ} = adξ ζ, {ξ, ζ} = adξ ζ. The Weil differential may be
      written as d = {D, ·} with D as in Remark 5.2 (a).
  (b) It is possible to re-introduce a grading on Wg, by adding an extra parameter. Let ~ be
      a variable of degree 2, and view S(F · ~) as a g − da with contractions, Lie derivatives
      and differential all equal to zero. Define a g − da Wg[~] as the quotient of T (e
                                                                                      g)⊗ S(F ·~)
      by the relations,
                      [ζ, ζ ′ ] = ~B(ζ, ζ ′ ), [ζ, ζ ′ ] = ~[ζ, ζ ′ ]g, [ζ, ζ ′ ] = ~[ζ, ζ ′ ]g
         (on the left hand side, the bracket denotes super commutators). Note that the ideal
         generated by these relations is graded. Hence Wg[~] is graded and the symmetrization
         map W g[~] = W g ⊗ S(F · ~) → Wg[~] preserves degrees. The Weil algebra W g is
         obtained by dividing out the ideal h~i, while Wg is obtained by dividing out h~ − 1i.
         This clearly exhibits Wg as a deformation of the Weil algebra W g.
     (c) Pavol Severa explained to us in the summer of 2001, that the quantization map from [1]
         is closely related to the exponential map for a central extension of the super Lie group
         T [1]G, as discussed in his paper [39]. Theorem 5.3 may be viewed as the algebraic
         version of Severa’s observation.

                                         6. Vogan conjecture
   Suppose k ⊂ g is a Lie subalgebra admitting a k-invariant complement p. Thus g = k ⊕ p
with
                                      [k, k]g ⊂ k, [k, p]g ⊂ p.
Any g−ds E becomes a k−ds by restricting the action to ek ⊂ e   g. If A is a g−da with connection
     ∗     1̄                               ∗     ∗
θ : g → A , then the restriction of θ to k ⊂ g defines a connection for A, viewed as a k − da.
In particular, any g − da of Weil type becomes a k − da of Weil type. Theorem 3.7 shows that
the projection map W g → W k induced by the projection is a k-homotopy equivalence, with
homotopy inverse induced by the inclusion Ek∗ → Eg∗ . Suppose now that g is a quadratic
Lie algebra, and that the restriction of the scalar product B to the subalgebra k is again non-
degenerate. We will refer to k as a quadratic subalgebra. In this case, we may take p to be the
orthogonal complement of k in g.
Example 6.1. Let g be a semi-simple Lie algebra, with B the Killing form, and g = k ⊕ p
a Cartan decomposition. Then k and p are orthogonal, and B is negative definite on k and
positive definite on p. See [19, Chapter 3.7] or [24, Chapter VII.2].
Example 6.2. Suppose F = C. For any ξ ∈ g, the generalized eigenspace for the 0 eigenvalue
of adξ
                              k = {ζ ∈ g| adN
                                            ξ ζ = 0 for N >> 0}
is a quadratic subalgebra, with p the direct sum of generalized eigenspaces for nonzero eigen-
values. Indeed, given ζ1 ∈ k, ζ2 ∈ p, let N > 0 with adNξ ζ1 = 0. Since adξ is invertible on p,
                       LIE THEORY AND THE CHERN-WEIL HOMOMORPHISM                                21

we have
                                                            −N
                           B(ζ1 , ζ2 ) = (−1)N B(adN
                                                   ξ ζ1 , adξ  ζ2 ) = 0.
This shows p = k⊥ .

  The inclusion ek ⊕ Fc → e
                          g ⊕ Fc is a k − dl homomorphism, hence it extends to a k − da
homomorphism
                                 U (ek ⊕ Fc) → U (e
                                                  g ⊕ Fc).
Taking quotients by the ideals generated by c−1, we obtain a k−da homomorphism Wk → Wg.
We obtain a commutative diagram of k − ds homomorphisms,

in which all maps are k-homotopy equivalences, and the induced maps in basic cohomology
are all algebra isomorphisms. We will now interpret these maps in terms of the isomorphism
Wg = U g ⊗ Cl(g). We have
                                 (Wg)k−hor = U g ⊗ Cl(p)
and therefore (Wg)k−basic = (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv . The Kostant cubic Dirac operator for the pair
g, k is defined to as the difference of the Dirac operators for g and k:
                                           Dg,k = Dg − Dk.
The first two parts of the following Proposition were proved by Kostant in [25]. Let
(22)                                    χ : U k ֒→ U g ⊗ Cl(p)
be the map given by the inclusion (W k)k−hor ֒→ (Wg)k−hor .
Proposition 6.3.     (a) The cubic Dirac operator Dg,k lies in the algebra (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv .
  (b) The square of Dg,k is given by the formula,

                      Dg,k =     Casg − χ(Cask) + (trg(Casg) − trk(Cask)).

   (c) The restriction of the differential on Wg to the subalgebra (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv is a graded
       commutator [Dg,k , ·].
Proof. (a) It is clear that Dg,k is k-invariant. Furthermore, for ξ ∈ k, we have
                               [Dg,k , ξ] = [Dg, ξ] − [Dk, ξ] = ξ − ξ = 0
so Dg,k is k-basic. (b) Since ιξ = [ξ, ·] and Lξ = [ξ, ·], the basic subalgebra (Wg)k−basic is
exactly the commutant of the subalgebra Wk ⊂ Wg. Hence Dg,k ∈ (Wg)k−basic and Dk ∈ Wk
commute, and the formula follows from (20) by squaring the identity Dg = Dg,k + Dk. (c) On
elements of (Wg)k−basic , [Dk, ·] vanishes since Dk ∈ Wk. Hence [Dg,k, ·] coincides with [Dg, ·] on
(Wg)k−basic .                                                                                     

   The following theorem is a version of Vogan’s conjecture (as formulated in Huang-Pandzic
[20]) for quadratic Lie algebras. It was first proved by Huang-Pandzic [20, Theorems 3.4, 5.5]
for symmetric pairs, and by Kostant [26, Theorem 0.2] for reductive pairs. In a recent paper,
Kumar [28] interpreted the Vogan conjecture in terms of induction maps in non-commutative
equivariant cohomology.
Theorem 6.4. The map χ : (U k)k−inv → (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv takes values in cocycles for the
differential [Dg,k, ·], and descends to an algebra isomorphism from (U k)k−inv to the cohomology
of (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv . The map (U g)g−inv → (U k)k−inv taking z ∈ (U g)g−inv to the cohomology
class of z ⊗ 1 ∈ (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv fits into a commutative diagram,
                                   (Sg)g−inv      / (U g)g−inv

where the horizontal maps are Duflo maps and the left vertical map is induced by the projection
g → k.
Proof. The commutative diagram (21) gives rise to a commutative diagram of k-basic subcom-
plexes,
                             (Sk)k−inv             / (U k)k−inv

As mentioned after (21), all of the maps in this diagram induce algebra isomorphisms in
cohomology. This proves the first part of the theorem. The second part follows by combining
this diagram with a commutative diagram

                             7. Harish-Chandra isomorphism
   Let g be a quadratic Lie algebra, with scalar product B, and k ⊂ g a quadratic subalge-
bra, with orthogonal complement p = k⊥ . In the previous Section, we obtained an algebra
homomorphism (U g)g−inv → (U k)k−inv which under the Duflo isomorphism corresponds to the
natural projection (Sg)g−inv → (Sk)k−inv . We will now describe an alternative construction of
this map for enveloping algebras, generalizing the Harish-Chandra construction [24, Chapter
V.5]
   An extra ingredient for the Harish-Chandra map is a k-invariant splitting p = n− ⊕ n+ into
Lie subalgebras of g which are isotropic, i.e. such that B vanishes on n± . Thus
(23)                                    g = n− ⊕ k ⊕ n+

(direct sum of subspaces).

Examples 7.1.      (a) In the standard setting of the Harish-Chandra theorem, g is a semi-
       simple Lie algebra over F = C, with compact real form gR , k = tC is the complexification
       of a maximal Abelian subalgebra of t ⊂ gR , and n± are nilpotent subalgebras given as
       sums of root spaces for the positive/negative roots. More generally, one could take k
       to be the centralizer of some element ξ ∈ t, and n+ (resp. n− ) the direct sum of the
       positive (resp. negative) root spaces that are not contained in k.
  (b) Suppose F = C. Consider the 2n + 2-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra C ⋉ Hn from
       Example 4.1(b). We obtain a decomposition (23) by letting   √ k be the Abelian subalgebra
       spanned by r and c, and letting n± be the span of e2i ± −1e2i−1 .
   (c) Both of these examples are special case of the following set-up. Suppose that gR is an
       arbitrary quadratic Lie algebra over R, g its complexification, and ξ ∈ gR . Since adξ
       preserves the quadratic form B, all eigenvalues of 1i adξ are real. Let gt ⊂ g denote the
       generalized eigenspace for the eigenvalue t ∈ R. Then [gt , gt′ ]g ⊂ gt+t′ , andLB(gt , gt′ ) = 0
       for      ′
       L t + t 6= 0. A decomposition (23) is obtained by setting k = g0 , n− = t<0 gt , n+ =
          t>0 gt .

   By the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem, the decomposition (23) of g yields a decomposition
of the enveloping algebra U g,

                                    U g = (n− U g + U g n+ ) ⊕ U k,

hence a (generalized) Harish-Chandra projection

                                           κU : U g → U k.

The projection κU is k-invariant, and restricts to an algebra homomorphism on the subalgebra
n− U g n+ ⊕ U k. Similar to κU , we define Harish-Chandra projections κCl : Cl(g) → Cl(k) using
the decomposition
                               Cl(g) = (n− Cl(g) + Cl(g) n+ ) ⊕ Cl(k)
and κW : Wg → Wk using the decomposition

(24)                                    n− Wg + Wg nf
                                  Wg = (f           + ) ⊕ Wk.

In Harish-Chandra’s construction for enveloping algebras, it is necessary to compose the pro-
jection κU with a “shift”. Consider the infinitesimal character on k,

                                            ζ 7→ Trn+ adζ .

The map
                                                          1
                                  τ : k → U k, ζ 7→ ζ +   2   Trn+ adζ
is a Lie algebra homomorphism, hence it extends to an algebra automorphism, τ : U k → U k.
In the standard case where k is a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semi-simple Lie algebra, this
is the “ρ-shift”. Remarkably, the shift is already built into the the projection κW :

Proof. Observe that the two projections κW and κU ⊗ κCl both vanish on En− Wg + WgEn+ .
Hence it suffices to compare them on the subalgebra Wk ⊂ Wg. Elements in Wk may be
written in the form ξi1 · · · ξir x where ξi1 , . . . , ξir ∈ k and x ∈ Cl(k) ⊂ Wk. For ξ ∈ k, we have
ξ = ξb + γ(ξ), where γ(ξ) decomposes into parts γ k(ξ) ∈ Cl(k) and γ p(ξ) ∈ Cl(p). Let bi ∈ n−
and cj ∈ n+ be dual bases, i.e. B(bi , cj ) = δij . We have,
                                     X                               

                          P
Here we have used j [bj , adξ cj ] = trn+ (adξ ), for all ξ ∈ k. Since (adξ bj )cj − bj (adξ cj ) ∈
n− Cl(g)n+ , it follows that
                                ξ = ξb − 21 trn+ (adξ ) + γ k(ξ) mod n− Cl(g)n+ .
Hence,
                                                                                                              

where the terms . . . are in En− Wg + WgEn+ . The term in the large parentheses lies in the
image of the tensor products of inclusions U k ֒→ U g, Cl(k) ֒→ Cl(g), and κU ⊗κCl is the identity
map on this image. Comparing with
                                ξi1 · · · ξir x = (ξbi1 + γ k(ξi1 )) · · · (ξbir + γ k(ξir ))x
the result follows.                                                                                                       

     It is now easy to verify the following properties of the Harish-Chandra map for Weil algebras.
Theorem 7.3 (Harish-Chandra projection for Weil algebras). Suppose g is a quadratic Lie

   (c) The above diagram contains a sub-diagram,

       where Sg is identified with (W g)g−hor , U g with (Wg)g−hor , and similarly for Sk and
       U k. In this sub-diagram the upper and lower horizontal map are Duflo maps, the left
       vertical map is κS , and the right vertical map is τ ◦ κU .

Proof. It is clear that the decomposition (24) is ek-equivariant, and that each summand is pre-
served by the differential. That is, (24) is a direct sum of k-differential subspaces, which proves
(a). Part (b) is immediate from Theorem 3.2. We have already shown that the symmetrization
maps for Weil algebras restrict to the Duflo maps, and it is clear that the left vertical map in
(c) is just κS . The fact that the vertical map is τ ◦ κU follows from Proposition 7.2.          

  Theorem 7.3 implies the following generalization of the Harish-Chandra homomorphism for
enveloping algebras.
Theorem 7.4. The following diagram commutes:

Here the horizontal maps are the Duflo isomorphisms for g and k, respectively.
Proof. By part (b) of the above Theorem, the diagram obtained by passing to k-basic coho-
mology
                              H((W g)k−basic )       / H((Wg)k−basic )

commutes. (Moreover, all maps in this diagram are algebra isomorphisms.) On the other
hand, the maps from g-basic cohomology to k-basic cohomology gives a commutative diagram
of algebra homomorphisms,

                                 (Sg)g−inv                 / (U g)g−inv

Placing these two diagrams on top of each other, it follows that the diagram in Theorem 7.4
commutes.                                                                                

Proposition 7.5. Under the assumptions of Theorem 7.4, the image of the cubic Dirac oper-
ator Dg under the Harish-Chandra projection is
                                         κW (Dg) = Dk,
the cubic Dirac operator Dk for the subalgebra.
Proof. Recall that Dg = Dk + Dg,k, where Dg,k ∈ (U g ⊗ Cl(p))k−inv . The image of Dg,k under the
Harish-Chandra projection vanishes since it is k-basic and odd. Hence, κW (Dg) = κW (Dk) =
Dk.                                                                                           
Remark 7.6. For semi-simple Lie algebras and k = h a Cartan subalgebra, the Harish-Chandra
projection κCl for Clifford algebras was studied by Kostant. In particular Kostant showed that
the image of a primitive generator of ∧g ∼ = Cl(g) is always linear, i.e. contained in h ⊂ Cl(h).
He made a beautiful conjecture relating these projections to the adjoint representation of the
principal TDS; this conjecture was recently proved by Y. Bazlov. It would be interesting to
understand these results within our framework.

                                 8. Rouvière isomorphism
   In his 1986 paper [37], F. Rouvière described generalizations of Duflo’s isomorphism to
a certain class of symmetric spaces G/K. In this Section, we will prove a Duflo-Rouvière
isomorphism for quadratic Lie algebras g, with a scalar product that is anti-invariant under a
given involution of g.
8.1. Statement of the theorem. Let ǫ : g → g be an involutive automorphism of a Lie
algebra g. Then g = k ⊕ p where k is the subalgebra fixed by ǫ, and p is the −1 eigenspace of
ǫ. We will refer to (g, k) as a symmetric pair. For any Lie algebra homomorphism f : k → F,
define a twisted inclusion of k in U k by
                                     kf = {ξ + f (ξ)| ξ ∈ k}.
Using the embedding U k ֒→ U g, we may view kf as a subspace of U g. The space
(25)                                   (U g/U g · kf )k−inv
inherits an algebra structure from the enveloping algebra U g: Indeed, U g · kf is a two-sided
ideal in the subalgebra {z ∈ U g| Lξ z ∈ U g · kf for all ξ ∈ k} of U g, and (25) is the quotient
algebra. The following was proved by Duflo, generalizing a result of Lichnerowicz [31]:
Theorem 8.1 (Duflo [14]). Let (g, k) be a symmetric pair, and let f : k → F be the character
f (ξ) = 12 trk(adξ ). Then the algebra (25) is commutative.
   The geometric interpretation of the algebra (25) is as follows. Suppose F = R, and let G
be the connected, simply connected Lie group having g as its Lie algebra. Assume that k ⊂ g
is the Lie algebra of a closed, connected subgroup of K ⊂ G. Taking f = 0, a theorem of
Lichnerowicz [30] shows that (25) is the algebra of G-invariant differential operators on the
symmetric space G/K. The algebra (25) for f (ξ) = 21 trk(adξ ) is interpreted as the algebra of
G-invariant differential operators on G/K, acting on sections of the half density bundle.
   Returning to the general case, we relate the algebra (25) to invariants in the symmetric
algebra Sp. Indeed, using a PBW basis one sees that the map
                          Sp ⊕ U g · kf → U g, (x, z) 7→ symU g(x) + z

is a k-module isomorphism. We therefore obtain an isomorphism of k-modules
                                     Sym : Sp → U g/U g kf
taking x ∈ Sp to the image of symU g(x) under the quotient map. Let Jp ∈ Sp∗ be defined by
the function
                                  Jp(ζ) = det(j(2 adζ )|p)
with j(z) = sinh(z/2)
                z/2   as in Section 5. This is well-defined: For ζ ∈ p, adζ takes k to p and vice
versa; since j is an even function, it follows that j(2 adζ ) preserves both k and p. Let
                                        d1/2
                                        Jp : Sp → Sp
denote the infinite order differential operator defined by the square root of the function Jp. In
Section 8.3 we will show:
Theorem 8.2. Let (g, k) be a symmetric pair, where k is the fixed point set of an involutive
automorphism ǫ. Suppose g admits an invariant scalar product B with ǫ∗ B = −B. Then the
composition
                                d 1/2
                          Sym ◦Jp : (Sp)k−inv → (U g/U g kf )k−inv
(where p is the −1 eigenspace for ǫ) is an algebra isomorphism.
Remark 8.3.      (a) A result similar to Theorem 8.2 was first proved by Rouvière [37] for
      symmetric pairs (g, k) satisfying one of the following two conditions: (i) g is solvable,
      or (ii) g satisfies the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture [23] and (g, k) is very symmetric in
      the sense that there is a linear isomorphism A : g → g, A(k) = p, A(p) = k such that
      [A, adξ ] = 0 for all ξ ∈ g. At the time of this writing the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture
      is still open, but it has been established for solvable Lie algebras and for quadratic
      Lie algebras [42] (see also [2]). (A major consequence of the conjecture, regarding
      convolution of invariant distributions, was proved in the series of papers [7, 5, 6]. See
      [41] for more information on the Kashiwara-Vergne method.)
  (b) It is known that for general symmetric pairs, the statement of Theorem 8.2 becomes
      false. A counter-example, examined in [15], is g = sl(2, R), with k = so(1) the subalgebra
      of diagonal matrices, and p the subspace of matrices having 0 on the diagonal.
8.2. Examples. Rouvières example K C /K is included in the setting of Theorem 8.2, as follows.
Suppose (k, Bk) is a quadratic Lie algebra over F = R, and g = kC is its complexification. Using
the extension of Bk to a complex-bilinear form on g, define a real-bilinear form
                                   Bg(ξ, η) = 2 Im(BkC (ξ, η))
on g, viewed as a real Lie algebra. Then B changes sign under the involution ǫ of g given √ by
                                                          ∼   ∗                   ∗ ∼
complex conjugation. The√bilinear form Bk identifies√k = k , while Bg identifies k = p = −1k.
The resulting map k → −1k is given by ξ 7→ 21 −1ξ. The function Jp(ξ) turns into the
following function
                                                               sin(z/2)
                            Jh (ξ) = det(jh (adξ )), jh (z) =           ,
                                                                  z/2
similar to the usual Duflo factor, but with a sin-function instead of a sinh-function. See [4] for
a geometric interpretation of this example.

   Suppose g is a quadratic Lie algebra, with involution ǫ changing the sign of the scalar product
B. Then B vanishes on both k (the +1 eigenspace of ǫ) and p (the −1 eigenspace of ǫ), and
hence defines a non-singular pairing between k and p. This identifies p and k∗ , and defines an
element C ∈ (∧3 k)k−inv by
                            B([µ, µ′ ]g, µ′′ ) = C(µ, µ′ , µ′′ ), µ, µ′ , µ′′ ∈ k∗ .
Conversely, given a Lie algebra k and an invariant element C ∈ ∧3 k, the direct sum g = k ⊕ k∗
carries a unique Lie bracket such that k is a Lie subalgebra, [ξ, µ]g = − ad∗ξ µ for ξ ∈ k, µ ∈ k∗ ,
and
                          [µ, µ′ ]g = C(µ, µ′ , ·) ∈ (k∗ )∗ = k, µ, µ′ ∈ k∗ .
Furthermore, the symmetric bilinear form B given by the pairing between k and k∗ is g-invariant,
and changes sign under the involution ǫ given by −1 on k∗ and by 1 on k. Hence all examples for
Theorem 8.2 may be described in terms of a Lie algebra k with a given element C ∈ (∧3 k)k−inv .
Examples 8.4.       (a) If C = 0, the Lie algebra g is just the semi-direct product g = k ⋉
       k∗ . In this case, one finds that (U g/U g kf )k−inv = (Sk∗ )k−inv and the Duflo-Rouvière
       isomorphism is just the identity map.
  (b) Suppose (k, Bk) is a quadratic Lie algebra over F = R. Then C(ξ, ξ ′ , ξ ′′ ) = ±Bk([ξ, ξ ′ ]k, ξ ′′ )
       defines an element C ∈ (∧3 k)k−inv (where we use Bk to identify k∗ with k). For the minus
       sign, one obtains the example g = kC considered above. For the plus sign, one arrives
       at g = k ⊕ k, with k embedded diagonally and p embedded anti-diagonally. In this case,
       the Duflo-Rouvière isomorphism reduces to the usual Duflo isomorphism.
   (c) Given n ≥ 3 let k be the nilpotent Lie algebra of strictly upper-triangular n×n-matrices,
       and {Eij , i < j} its natural basis, where Eij is the matrix having 1 in the (i, j) position
       and zeroes elsewhere. Then C = E1,n−1 ∧ E1,n ∧ E2,n lies in (∧3 k)k−inv . The resulting
       quadratic Lie algebra g is solvable for n = 3, and nilpotent for n ≥ 4.
  (d) There are non-trivial examples of C ∈ (∧3 k)k−inv such that the resulting symmetric pair
       (g, k) is not very symmetric in Rouvière’s sense, and also g not solvable.
           Indeed if (g, k) is a very symmetric pair with [k, k]k = k, then [p, p]g = k, or equivalently
       ker(C) ≡ {µ ∈ k∗ | ιµ C = 0} = 0. Take k = a ⋉ a∗ with a semi-simple. Let C ∈ ∧3 a∗ ⊂
       ∧3 k be defined by the Lie bracket and the Killing form on a. Since C has non-zero
       kernel, (g, k) is not very symmetric. Furthermore, a ⊂ k ⊂ g is the Levi factor of g
       which shows that g is not solvable.
8.3. Proof of Theorem 8.2. View Wg as a k-differential algebra, with connection defined by
the canonical g-connection and the splitting g = k ⊕ p.
   Recall that the contraction operators on e    g ⊂ Wg are given by ιξ ζ = B(ξ, ζ), ιξ ζ = Lξ ζ.
                                      e
Since k is isotropic, it follows that k is a k-differential subspace of Wg, and so is the left ideal
Wgek. The algebra structure on Wg does not descend to the k − ds Wg/(Wg ek), in general.
However, there is an induced algebra structure on the basic subcomplex (Wg/(Wg ek))k−basic
since its pre-image in Wg is a subalgebra containing Wg ek as a 2-sided ideal.
Proposition 8.5. The characteristic homomorphism W k → Wg ∼
                                                          = U g ⊗ Cl(g) descends to a
k − ds isomorphism
(26)                        = S(Ep) → Wg/(Wg ek) ∼
                         Wk ∼                    = (U g/U g kf ) ⊗ ∧p,

an isomorphism of k-modules
(27)                              = Sp → (Wg/(Wg ek))k−hor ∼
                       (W k)k−hor ∼                        = U g/U g kf ,
and an isomorphism of algebras
(28)                     = (Sp)k−inv → (Wg/(Wg ek))k−basic ∼
            (W k)k−basic ∼                                 = (U g/U g kf )k−inv .
Proof. By a PBW argument, the map
                             S(Ep) ⊕ Wg ek → Wg, (x, z) 7→ Qg(x) + z
is a k − ds isomorphism. Thus, the quotient map W k ∼  = S(Ep) → Wg/Wgek is again a k − ds
isomorphism, and its restriction to horizontal subspaces is a k-module isomorphism.
   The map on basic subspaces is a composition
                      (W k)k−basic → (Wg)k−basic → (Wg/(Wg ek))k−basic ,
where the second map is an algebra homomorphism, and the first map induces an algebra homo-
morphism in cohomology. Since the differential vanishes on (W k)k−basic and as a consequence
vanishes on (Wg/(Wg ek))k−basic , it follows that (28) is an algebra isomorphism.
   It remains to identify Wg/(Wg ek) and its horizontal and basic subspaces in terms of the
isomorphism Wg = U g ⊗ Cl(g). Observe that Wg ek is the left ideal generated by elements ζ, ζ
with ζ ∈ k. We will show that
                          ζ = ζb + γ g(ζ) = ζb + 1 trk(ζ) mod Wg k.
                                                       2

To see this, choose bases ei of k and       of p such that B(ei , ej ) = δij . Then
                                           ej

                γ g(ζ) = 21       (adζ (ei )ei + adζ (ei )ei )
                                   i
                                  X                                    X
                         =    1
                              2    (−ei adζ (ei ) + adζ (ei )ei ) + 12   B(adζ (ei ), ei ).
                                   i                                    i
                                                                    1
The first sum lies in Wg k, while the second sum gives trk(adζ ) mod Wg k. This proves
                                                                    2
Wg/(Wg ek) = (U g/U g kf ) ⊗ ∧p, where the contractions ιξ are induced by the contractions
on ∧p = ∧k∗ . Hence the k-horizontal subspace is (U g/U g kf ), and the k-basic subcomplex is
(U g/U g kf )k−inv .                                                                       
  To complete the proof of Theorem 8.2, we have to identify the isomorphism (27) from Sp
                                 d1/2
onto U g/U gkf with the map Sym ◦Jp . Our calculation will require the following Lemma.

for a unique choice of square root of det(I + AB).
     In particular, it follows that the map
                          ∧2 V ∗ × ∧2 V → F, (λ(A), λ(B)) 7→ det(I + AB)
admits a smooth square root, given by the degree zero part of ι(exp(λ(A)) exp(λ(B)).
Proof. This may be proved by methods similar to [3, Section 5], to which we refer for more
details. Let V ⊕ V ∗ be equipped with the symmetric bilinear form given by the pairing between
V and V ∗ , and Spin(V ⊕ V ∗ ) → SO(V ⊕ V ∗ ) be the corresponding Spin group. One has the
following factorization in SO(V ⊕ V ∗ ),

Proposition 8.7. The k-module isomorphism Sp → U g/U g kf in (27) is equal to the map

Proof. We write (27) as a composition of maps

Similarly, r(ξ) splits into a sum r ′ (ξ) + r ′′ (ξ) where r ′ (ξ) ∈ ∧2 p and r ′′ (ξ) ∈ ∧2 k. We may
replace r(ξ) with r ′ (ξ) in (29) since the r ′′ (ξ) part will not contribute to the contraction. Thus,
we may calculate (29) using Lemma 8.6, with
                              V = p, A = (ln j)′ (adξ )|p, B = adξ |p∗ .
Letting (·)[0] denote the ∧0 g component, the Lemma gives,

                                   sinh(z)

To summarize, the composition of the maps (i),(ii),(iii) is the map Sp → U g given by application
                                            d1/2
of an infinite-order differential operator Jp on Sp, followed by the PBW symmetrization map
sym : Sp → U g . Since the map Sym : Sp → U g/U g kf is defined as PBW symmetrization
followed by the quotient map (iv), the proof is complete.                                       

8.4. Isotropic subalgebras. Theorem 8.2 may be generalized, as follows. Suppose g is a qua-
dratic Lie algebra, and k ⊂ g an isotropic subalgebra with k-invariant complement p. Suppose
p is co-isotropic, that is, the B-orthogonal subspace p⊥ is contained in p. Then B induces a
non-singular pairing between k and p⊥ , and the restriction of B to
                                             m = k⊥ ∩ p
is non-singular. Since k is isotropic, ek ⊂ e
                                            g ⊕ Fc is a k-differential subspace, and we may form
the quotient k − ds, Wg/Wg ek. The proof of Proposition 8.5 carries over with no change, and
shows that the map S(Ep) → Wg/Wg ek given by the inclusion S(Ep) ֒→ W g, followed by the
quantization map and the quotient map, is a k − ds isomorphism.
   Since the scalar product identifies p⊥ ∼= k∗ , the k − da S(Ep) is of Weil type, with connection
k∗ → Ep given by the inclusion as p⊥ ⊂ p. It follows that the map in basic cohomology
                                S(p⊥ )k−inv → H((Wg/Wg ek)k−basic )
32                              A. ALEKSEEV AND E. MEINRENKEN

is an algebra isomorphism. The algebra on the right hand side admits the following alternative
description. Let γ m : k → Cl m be the map defined by the k-action on m. Then
                            γ g(ζ) =   1
                                       2   trk(adζ ) + γ m(ζ)   mod Wgek.

Define a twisted inclusion k → U g ⊗ Cl(m) by ζ 7→ ζb + 21 trk(adζ ) + γ m(ζ) and let kf denote
the image of this inclusion. As in the proof of Proposition 8.5, one finds that the algebra
(Wg/Wg ek)k−basic is canonically isomorphic to the algebra
                                     U g ⊗ Cl(m) 
(30)                                                       .
                                     (U g ⊗ Cl(m))kf k−inv
One therefore arrives at the following result:
Theorem 8.8. Let g be a quadratic Lie algebra, with isotropic subalgebra k and k-invariant
co-isotropic complement p. Let m = k⊥ ∩ p. The algebra (30) carries a natural differential, with
cohomology algebra canonically isomorphic to (Sk∗ )k−inv .
  Suppose F = R, and that G is a connected Lie group and K a closed connected subgroup
having g, k as their Lie algebras. Then (30) has the following geometric interpretation. For any
K-module V , consider the algebra DO(G ×K V )G−inv of G-invariant differential operators on
the associated bundle G ×K V . There is a canonical algebra isomorphism (cf. [30])
                                                U g ⊗ End(V ) 
                          DO(G ×K V )G−inv =
                                                (U g ⊗ End(V )) k K−inv
where k → U g ⊗ End(V ) is embedded diagonally. Thus, if S is any module for the Clifford
algebra Cl(m), and if the action of the Lie algebra k (via k → Cl(m)) on S exponentiates to
an action of the Lie group K, there is an algebra homomorphism from the algebra (30) to the
algebra of invariant differential operators on G ×K S, twisted by the half density bundle. If
the module S is faithful and irreducible, Cl(m) ∼= End(S) and this algebra homomorphism is
an isomorphism.

                            9. Universal characteristic forms
   As a final application of our theory, we obtain a new construction of universal characteristic
forms in the Bott-Shulman complex [8, 16, 35, 40]. We assume F = R, and let G be a connected
Lie group with Lie algebra g. Recall that in the simplicial construction of the classifying bundle
EG → BG [35, 38], one models the de Rham complex of differential forms on EG by a double
complex C p,q = Ωq (Gp+1 ) with differentials d : C p,q →          p,q+1
                                                              P C i (the de Rham∗ differential) and
     p,q
δ: C →C       p+1,q . Here δ is the alternating sum δ = (−1) δi where δi = ∂i is the pull-back
under the map,
                        ∂i : Gp+1 → Gp , (g0 , . . . , gp ) 7→ (g0 , . . . , gbi , . . . , gp )
omitting the ith entry. View each Ep G = Gp+1 as a principal G-bundle over Bp G = Gp , with
action the diagonal G-action from the right, and quotient map Ep G → Bp G, (g0 , . . . , gp ) 7→
(g0 g1−1 , g1 g2−1 , . . .). Let
                              ιξ : C p,q → C p,q−1 , Lξ : C p,q → C p,q

with differential D = d + (−1)q δ, contractions ιξ and Lie derivatives Lξ becomes a g − ds.

Rham theorem [35, Theorem 4.3], the total cohomology of the basic subcomplex computes the
cohomology of the classifying space BG, with coefficients in R. Define a product structure on
the double complex,
                                   ′   ′            ′          ′   ′            ′   ′

respectively last p′ + 1, G-factors in Gp+p +1 , and the second map is wedge product. (This
formula is motivated by the usual formula for cup products of the singular cochain complex.)
It is straightforward to verify that D, ιξ , Lξ are derivations for the product structure, thus W
becomes a g − da. It is locally free, with a natural connection
                                       θ : g∗ → C 0,1 = Ω1 (G)
given by the left-invariant Maurer-Cartan form on G. Hence, by symmetrization we obtain a
g − ds homomorphism W g → W which restricts to a map of basic subcomplexes. The resulting
map

takes an invariant polynomial of degree r to a D-cocycle of total degree 2r. By our general
theory, the induced map in cohomology is a ring homomorphism. As in the usual Bott-Shulman
construction we have the following vanishing phenomenon:
Proposition 9.1. The image of an invariant polynomial of degree r under the map (31) has
non-vanishing components only in bidegrees (p, q) with p + q = 2r and p ≤ r.
Proof. The connection θ lives in bidegree (0, 1), and its total differential Dθ has non-vanishing
components only in bi-degrees (0, 2) and (1, 1). Since the product structure is compatible with
the bi-grading, it follows that the image of an element ξ i1 · · · ξ il ξj1 · · · ξjm ∈ W g under the
symmetrization map only involves bi-degrees (p, q) with p + q = 2l + m and p ≤ l. Any element
in S r g∗ ⊂ W g is a linear combination of such elements, with 2l + m = 2r.                        

  Let W L ⊂ W denote the direct sum over the subspaces (C p,q )L = Ωq (Gp+1 )L of forms that
are invariant under the left Gp+1 -action. Clearly, W L is a g-differential subalgebra of W . Since
the connection is left-invariant, our Chern-Weil map takes values in the subalgebra Wbasic L .


Theorem 9.2. W L is a g − da of Weil type. If G is compact and connected, the g − da W is
of Weil type, with the inclusion W L ֒→ W a g-homotopy equivalence.
  It follows that in this case, the map (31) gives an isomorphism in cohomology.

Proof. We first recall the standard proof that W is acyclic. Let Π : W → W be the projection
operator given on C p,q as pull-back under the map
                               π : Gp+1 → Gp+1 , (g0 , . . . , gp ) 7→ (e, . . . , e).
The projection Π is naturally chain homotopic to the identity: To construct a homotopy
operator, let
               sj : Gp+1 → Gp+2 , (g0 , . . . , gp ) 7→ (g0 , . . . , gj , e, . . . , e), i = 0, . . . , p
               P
and set s = pj=0 (−1)j s∗j : C p+1,q → C p,q . Note that on Gp+1 , ∂p+1 sp = id, ∂0 s0 = π. A
                                                                                    L
direct calculation (as in May [33]) shows that [δ, s] = Π − id on ∞                          q
                                                                                        p=0 Ω (G
                                                                                                 p+1 ), for any fixed

q. Since [d, s] = 0, it follows that −(−1)q s : Ωq (Gp+1 ) → Ωq (Gp+2 ) gives the desired homotopy
between the identity and Π.
    The image Π(W ) ⊂ W is isomorphic to the singular cochain complex of a point. Hence,
composing with the standard homotopy operator for this complex we see that the inclusion
i : F ֒→ W is a homotopy equivalence. Let h : W → W denote the homotopy operator
constructed in this way.
    The map s does not commute with Lξ since the maps sj are not G-equivariant. However,
on the left invariant subcomplex W L this problem disappears, since s∗j ◦ Lξ = Lξ ◦ s∗j on W L .
It follows that h restricts to a homotopy operator on W L with [h, Lξ ] = 0. This shows that
W L is of Weil type.
    Suppose now that G is compact. Then there is a projection Π1 : W → W L , given on
Ω (Gp+1 ) as the averaging operator for the left Gp+1 -action. It is well-known that the averaging
  q

operator is homotopic to the identity operator; the homotopy operator h1 may be chosen to
commute with Lξ , by averaging under the right G-action. (In our case, one may directly
construct h1 using the Hodge decomposition for the bi-invariant Riemannian metric on G.)
It follows that Π|W L ◦ Π1 is homotopic to the identity map, by a homotopy operator that
commutes with Lξ and lowers the total degree by 1.                                                                 
Remark 9.3. For the classical groups, there is another model for differential forms on the
classifying bundle, as an inverse limit of differential forms on Stiefel manifolds – e.g. for
G = U(k), the inverse limit of Ω(St(k, n)) for n → ∞. The resulting g − da carries a natural
“universal” connection (see Narasimhan-Ramanan [36]). The characteristic homomorphism for
this case was studied by Kumar in [29].

                                 Appendix A. Proof of Theorem 3.7
                                                                                          S
   Recall that a linear operator C on a vector space E is locally nilpotent if E = N ≥0 E (N )
where E (N ) is the kernel of C N +1 . If C is locally nilpotent, the operator I +C has a well-defined
inverse, since the geometric series I − C + C 2 − C 3 ± · · · is finite on each E (N ) .
Lemma A.1. Suppose E is a g-differential space, and h ∈ End(E)1̄ an odd linear operator
with the following properties:
                                [ιξ , h] = 0, [Lξ , h] = 0, [d, h] = I − Π + C
where Π is a projection operator, and C is locally nilpotent. Assume that h and C vanish on
the range of Π. Then Π̃ = Π(I + C)−1 is a projection operator having the same range as Π.

Furthermore, it is a g − ds homomorphism, and h̃ = h(I + C)−1 is a g-homotopy between I
and Π̃:
                              [ιξ , h̃] = 0, [Lξ , h̃] = 0, [d, h̃] = I − Π̃.

Proof. Since CΠ = 0, it is clear that Π̃ is a projection operator. We will check [d, h̃] = I − Π̃
on any given v ∈ E. Choose N sufficiently large so that v ∈ E (N ) and dv ∈ E (N ) . On E (N ) ,
the operator h̃ is a finite series

                  h̃ = h(I − C + C 2 − · · · + (−1)N C N )
                      = h(I − (C − Π) + (C − Π)2 + · · · + (−1)N (C − Π)N ),

where we have used hΠ = 0 and CΠ = 0. The equation [d, h] = I − Π + C shows that C − Π
commutes with d. Thus

                [d, h̃] = [d, h](I − (C − Π) + (C − Π)2 + · · · + (−1)N (C − Π)N )

on the subspace {v ∈ E (N ) | dv ∈ E (N ) }. But [d, h] = I − Π + C also shows [d, h]Π = 0. Hence
we may replace C − Π by C again, and get

                           [d, h̃]   = [d, h](I − C + C 2 + · · · )
                                     = [d, h](I + C)−1
                                     = (I − Π + C)(I + C)−1 = I − Π̃.

By a similar argument, since [Lξ , C − Π] = [Lξ , [h, d]] = 0 and [ιξ , C − Π] = −[ιξ , [h, d]] =
−[h, Lξ ] = 0, one proves [Lξ , h̃] = 0 and [ιξ , h̃] = 0.                                      

Lemma A.2. Suppose E is a g-differential space, and E ′ ⊂ Ebasic a differential subspace.
Suppose h : E → E is an odd linear operator with [Lξ , h] = 0 and [d, h] = I − Π, where Π
     projection operator onto E ′ with hΠ = 0. Assume there exists an increasing filtration
is a S
E= ∞   N =0 E
              (N ) , with E ′ ⊂ E (0) , such that each ι and h have negative filtration degree. Then,
                                                        ξ
for any locally free g-differential space B, the inclusion map

                                           E′ ⊗ B → E ⊗ B

is a g-homotopy equivalence, with a homotopy inverse E ⊗ B → E ′ ⊗ B that is equal to the
identity on E ′ ⊗ B.

Proof. The proof is inspired by an argument of Guillemin-Sternberg (see [18, Theorem 4.3.1]).
If [ιE
     ξ , h] = 0, the projection operator Π = Π⊗I is the desired homotopy inverse to the inclusion
map, with homotopy h = h ⊗ 1. In the general case, we employ the Kalkman trick [22] to shift
the contraction operators on E ⊗ B to the second factor. Let                                a
                  ∗                           ∗
                                                                Pea bea aEbasis of g, and e the
dual basis of g . Choose a connection θ : g → B. Then ψ = a θ(e )ιea is an even, nilpotent
operator on E ⊗ B, with [ψ, LE           B
                                   ξ + Lξ ] = 0. Hence exp ψ is a well defined even, invertible
operator on E ⊗ B, and it commutes with the g-action. Let

       L̃ξ = Ad(exp ψ)(LE    B                     E    B                    E   B

where the remainder term R is a polynomial in contractions ιE    ea , with coefficients in B (with
no constant term). The operator h commutes with the contractions ι̃ξ and Lie derivatives L̃ξ ,
and
                         [d̃, h] = [dE , h] + [R, h] = I − Π + [R, h].
Our assumptions imply that C = [R, h] has negative filtration degree, and in particular is locally
nilpotent. Thus Lemma A.1 applies and shows that Π̃ = Π(I + C)−1 is a projection operator
with the same range E ′ ⊗ B, and is homotopic to the identity by a homotopy h̃ = h(I + C)−1
which commutes with all ι̃ξ , L̃ξ . Since ιE                ′
                                           ξ vanishes on E , the operator exp ψ acts trivially on
                     b = Π̃◦exp(ψ) is a projection onto E ′ ⊗B. The operator b
E ′ ⊗B and therefore Π                                                       h = Ad(exp(−ψ))h̃
                                         b
gives the desired g-homotopy between Π and the identity.                                        
Proof of Theorem 3.7. Let W, W ′ be g − da’s of Weil type. Lemma A.2 (for E = W ′ and
B = W ) gives a g-homotopy equivalence W → W ′ ⊗ W, w 7→ 1 ⊗ w. Reversing the roles of
W, W ′ , the Lemma also shows that there exists a g-homotopy equivalence W ⊗ W ′ → W ′ that
restricts to the identity map on F ⊗ W ′ . By composition, we obtain a g-homotopy equivalence
W → W ′ taking units to units.                                                             
