                                                Graded Lie algebras (gla) are commonly used in many areas of Mathematics
                                             and Physics. One of the reasons is that they offer a very convenient framework
                                             for the development of theories such as Cohomology Theory, Deformation Theory,
                                             among others, very often avoiding heavy computations. But the fundamental rea-
                                             son, developed with the work of M. Gerstenhaber and others, is that the gla notion
                                             allows to endow with a structure, objects that a priori had none, providing a new
                                             and efficient material to study these objects. The aim of this paper is to give some
                                             new applications of classical well-known gla related to Deformation Theory.   V
                                                Let us start with some notations: g will be a complex vector space, g the
                                             Grassmann algebra of g, that is, the algebra of skew multilinear
                                                                                                           V
                                                                                                                forms on g, with
                                             the wedge product. When g is finite-dimensional, one has g = Ext(g∗ ), where
                                             Ext(g∗ ) denotes the exterior algebra of the dual space
                                                                                                   V
                                                                                                       g∗ . However, when g is
                                                                                               ∗
                                             not finite dimensional, the strict inclusion Ext(g ) ⊂ g holds. A quadratic vector
                                             space is a vector space endowed with a non degenerate symmetric bilinear form. In
                                             the case of a quadratic Lie algebra this bilinear form has to be invariant. A theory
                                             of finite dimensional quadratic Lie algebras, based on the notion of double exten-
                                             sion, was developed in [8, 18] following Kac’s arguments [13]. In this paper, we
                                             shall present another interpretation based on the concept of super Poisson bracket.

        algebra structure on the Grassmann algebra g (see  V
                                                                Section 4) and the
        superalgebra H (g) of Hamiltonian derivations of g.

    For (1) and (2), we refer to [11], for (3) to [20], for (4) to Koszul’s presentation
[17] (though [11] could be convenient as well). For (5), though it is a known
algebra, we have no references, probably because of the lack of applications up
to now (we shall show, e.g. in Sections 5 to 8, that there are some natural and
interesting ones). Since we want to fix our conventions and notations and since we
do not wish to address the present work to gla experts only, we give an introduction
to all the above gla , recalling the main properties that will be used all along this
paper.
    Section 1 is a review of M (g) and Ma (g). We conclude the Section with a
notion of Generalized Lie Algebras structures, that we call 2k-Lie algebras, namely
the elements F in Ma2k (g) that satisfy [F, F]a = 0. Such structures are introduced
in [9] and many other papers (e.g. [3]), under various names.
    In Section 2, we recall how to go from Ma (g) to D(g), an operation that can
be translated as going from a structure to its cohomology, as we shall now ex-
plain. The argument is given by (2.1.1): there exists a one to one gla homomor-
phism from Ma (g)[1] to D(g), which turns out to be an isomorphism when g is
finite dimensional.
                 V
                     So given a 2k-Lie algebra structure on g, there is an associated
derivation D of g, and the (generalized) Jacobi identity [F, F]a = 0 is equivalent
to D2 = 0, so that D defines a cohomology complex (2.3). This is well known for
Lie algebras since the corresponding complex is the Chevalley complex of trivial
cohomology. The existence of a cohomology complex for a 2k-Lie algebra was
pointed out (without the gla interpretation), e.g. in [3]. We then recall the defini-
tion and properties of the Schouten bracket for a finite dimensional g. As in [3],
we define a Generalized Poisson Bracket (GPB) as an element W of W 2k (g) sat-
isfying [W,W ]S = 0 (2.4.1), the obvious generalization of the classical definition
of a Poisson bracket. We show that there exists a one to one gla homomorphism
from D(g) into W (g)[1] (2.5.1), so that any 2k-Lie algebra structure on g has an
associated GPB, generalizing the classical Lie-Kostant-Kirillov bracket associated
to a Lie algebra.
    We apply the results of Sections 1 and 2 to standard polynomials in Section
3. Standard polynomials Ak (k ≥ 0) on an associative algebra g, appear in the PI
algebras theory (see [12]) and also in cohomology theory (for instance, the coho-
mology of gl(n) is Ext[a1 , a3 , . . . , a2n−1 ] where ak = Tr(Ak ), and the cohomology
of gl(∞) is Ext[a1 , a3 , . . . ] [10]). We show that there exist two different structures
on the space A = span{Ak | k ≥ 0}, both with interesting consequences. The
first one comes from the Gerstenhaber bracket of Ma (g): we compute explicitly
                      NEW APPLICATIONS OF GRADED LIE ALGEBRAS                              3

[Ak , Ak′ ]a , and it results that A is a subalgebra of the gla Ma (g) (3.2.1). Since
[A2k , A2k ]a = 0, any even standard polynomial define a 2k-Lie algebra structure on
g (3.2.2). Moreover, A2k is a coboundary (an invariant one) of the adjoint cohomol-
ogy of the Lie algebra A2 defined by the associative algebra g. The second product,
denoted
    V
           by ×, is associative and is defined on Ma (g) using both the wedge product
on g and the initial product on g (a priori, non commutative). So, it is rather a sur-
prise to find that A is an Abelian algebra for ×, and in fact a very simple one, since
Ak = (A1 )×k , ∀k (3.3.2). For instance, for g = gl(n), A with its ×-product is iso-
morphic to C[x]/x2n , since Ak = 0, ∀k ≥ 2n (the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem [1, 15]).
From identities (3.3.2), one deduces some classical well-known identities of stan-
dard polynomials (e.g. A2k = (A2 )×k , ∀k, usually proved by hand). When g has a
trace, we prove that Tr([F, G]× ) = 0, for all F, G ∈ Ma (g) (3.3.5), and then (keep-
ing the notation ak = Tr(Ak )), that a2k = 0, ∀k > 0, and that a2k+1 is an invariant
Lie algebra cocycle (3.3.6). To conclude Section 3, we compute the cohomology
of the Lie algebra g of finite rank operators in an infinite dimensional space. Obvi-
ously, gl(∞) ⊂ g, but this inclusion is strict. Our result is H ⋆ (g) = Ext[a1 , a3 , . . . ]
(3.3.11), so the above inclusion induces an isomorphism in cohomology.
   The first part of V  Section 4 is devoted to the construction of the super Poisson
bracket defined on g, when g is a finite dimensional quadratic vector space. We
follow a deformation argument as    V
                                      in [14]: the Clifford algebra Cliff(g∗ ) can be seen
as a quantization of the algebra g of skew polynomials, similarly to the classical
Moyal quantization of polynomials by the Weyl algebra. In 4.1, we introduce some
formulas for the construction of the Clifford algebra that are convenient since they
easily provide a transparent explicit formula for the deformed product (4.1.1), with
leading term the super Poisson bracket, explicitly computed in (4.2.1). The relation
with the superalgebra H(n)  e     [20] is given in (4.1.3), and a Moyal type formula
is obtained (4.2.2) (an equivalent formula without the super Poisson V        bracket can
be found in [14]). In the second part of Section 4, we use the gla g and the
super Poisson bracket to study quadratic Lie algebras. We obtain that quadratic Lie
algebra structures on g with bilinear form B are in one to one correspondence with
                 V
elements I in 3 g satisfying {I, I} = 0; more precisely, I(X ,Y, Z) = B([X ,Y ], Z),
                                             V
∀X , Y , Z ∈ g, and the differential ∂ of g is ∂ = − 21 adP (I) (4.5.1, 4.6.1). We
prove that any quadratic deformation of a quadratic Lie algebra is equivalent to a
deformation with unchanged invariant bilinear form (4.4.1), and finally, we propose
a gla framework well adapted to the deformation theory of quadratic Lie algebras
(4.6.2).
   We use the results of Section 4 in Section 5 to give a complete description of
finite dimensional elementary quadratic Lie algebras, i.e. those with decomposable
                            V
associated element I in 3 g (5.1.3). We first give a simple characterization (5.1.4):
a non Abelian quadratic Lie algebra g is elementary if and only if dim([g, g]) = 3.
We then show that any non Abelian quadratic Lie algebra reduces, up to a central
factor, to a quadratic Lie algebra with totally isotropic center (5.2.1); the property
of being elementary is preserved under the reduction. This reduces the problem of
finding all elementary non Abelian quadratic Lie algebras to algebras of dimension
3 to 6 (5.2.2), that we completely describe in (5.3) and (5.3.2). Some remarks: as
4                       GEORGES PINCZON, ROSANE USHIROBIRA

we show in (5.1.5), if g is an elementary quadratic Lie algebra, all coadjoint orbits
have dimension at most 2. Now, a classification of Lie algebras whose coadjoint
orbits are of dimension less than 2, is given in [2], and the proof, using classical
Lie algebra theory is not at all trivial. With some effort, one could probably find
directly in the classification of [2], which algebras are quadratic and which are not.
Our geometric flavored proof is completely different, using essentially elementary
properties of quadratic forms.
   In Section 6, we study cyclic cohomology of quadratic Lie algebras. Given
a quadratic vector space g, we use g-valued cochains (rather than g∗ -valued, by
analogy to the associative case [7]) to define cyclic cochains (6.2.1) (both notions
are equivalent when g is finite dimensional). Thanks to this definition, we can
use the Gerstenhaber bracket of Ma (g) and we show that cyclic cochains are well
behaved with respect to this bracket: the space Cc (g) of cyclic cochains is a subal-
gebra of the gla Ma (g) (6.2.2) and if g is a Lie algebra, Cc (g) is a subcomplex of
the adjoint cohomology complex Ma (g) (6.3.1); we define the cyclic cohomology
Hc∗ (g) as the cohomologyVof thisVsubcomplex (6.3.2). There is a natural one to
one map from Cc (g) into Q g = g/C (6.2.2) which induces a map from Hc∗ (g)
                                                                 V
into HQ∗ (g) = H(g)/C. When g is finite dimensional, Q g is a gla for the (quo-
tient) Poisson bracket, isomorphic to H (g), and there is an induced V    gla structure
on HQ (g). We show that there is a gla isomorphism from Cc (g) onto Q g (6.3.4),
and from Hc∗ (g) onto HQ∗ (g) (6.4.7). We also introduce a wedge product on Cc (g),
and on Hc∗ (g) (6.4.4, 6.4.5) which proves to be useful to describe Hc∗ (g) (6.4.7).
When g is not finite dimensional, the isomorphism between Hc∗ (g) and HQ∗ (g) is
no longer true: we give an example where the natural map is neither one to one,
nor onto (6.4.10, 6.4.11). So the cyclic cohomology Hc∗ (g) can have its own life,
independently of the reduced cohomology HQ∗ (g).
   Section 7 starts with the study of invariant cyclic cochains in the case of a finite
dimensional quadratic Lie algebra. We first prove that any invariant cyclic cochain
is a cocycle (7.1.2). When g is reductive, we demonstrate that the inclusion of
invariants cyclic cochains into cocycles induces an isomorphism in cohomology
(7.1.2), so that Hc∗ (g) ≃ Cc (g)g . Assuming that g is a semisimple Lie algebra, we
prove:                               V
                        If I, I ′ ∈ ( g)g , then {I, I ′ } = 0. (7.2.1)
   As a corollary, when g is semisimple, the Gerstenhaber bracket induces the null
bracket on Hc∗ (g). Applying theVpreceding results, we give a complete description
of the super Poisson bracket in ( g)g , and of the gla Hc∗ (g), when g = gl(n) (7.2.6).
   We develop in Section 8, the theory of quadratic 2k-Lie algebra structures on a
semisimple Lie algebra g, in relation with cyclic cochains (8.1.3). This is a direct
generalization of the case of quadratic Lie algebras studied in Section 4. We show
that any invariant
          V
                    even cyclic cochain F defines a quadratic 2k-Lie algebra (8.2.1)
and that ( g)g = H ⋆ (g) is contained in H ⋆ (F). Finally, we give an interpretation of
some interesting examples given in [3] of 2k-Lie algebras in terms of the techniques
developed in the present paper, pointing out where these examples come from.

Finally, we give some examples of quadratic 2k-Lie algebra structures on gl(n)
(8.3.1).

                1. M (g), Ma (g) AND 2k-L IE               ALGEBRA STRUCTURES

   This Section is essentially a review, except 1.3. For more details, see [11] and
[19].
   Let g be a complex vector space. We denote by M (g) the space of multilinear
mappings from g to g. The space M (g) is graded as follows:

                                        M (g) =      ∑ M k (g)
                                                     k≥0

where M 0 (g) = g, M k (g) = {F : gk → g | F k-linear}, for k ≥ 1.

1.1. The theory of associative algebra structures on g can be described in a graded
Lie algebra framework [11, 19]: first, consider M (g) with shifted grading M k [1] =
M k+1 (g) and denote it M [1]. Then define a graded Lie bracket on M [1] as fol-
lows: for all F ∈ M p [1], G ∈ M q [1], then [F, G] ∈ M p+q [1] with

[F, G](X1 , . . . , X p+q+1 ) :=
              p+1
    (−1) pq   ∑ (−1)q( j−1)         F(X1 , . . . , X j−1 , G(X j , . . . , X j+q ), X j+q+1 , . . . , X p+q+1 )
              j=1
              q+1
           − ∑ (−1) p( j−1) G(X1 , . . . , X j−1 , F(X j , . . . , X j+p ), X j+p+1 , . . . , X p+q+1 ).
              j=1

for X1 , . . . , X p+q+1 ∈ g.
   Notice that when X ∈ M −1 [1] = g, then [X , G] is defined by:
                                        q+1
          [X , G](X1 , . . . , Xq ) = − ∑ (−1) j−1 G(X1 , . . . , X j−1 , X , X j , . . . , Xq ).
                                         j=1

   Notice also that when F and G are in M 0 [1] = End(g), then [F, G] is the usual
bracket of the two linear maps F and G.
   Now, suppose that F ∈ M 1 [1] defines a product on g by:
                                   X ·Y = F(X ,Y ), ∀ X ,Y ∈ g.

   This product is associative if and only if [F, F] = 0. In this case, the deriva-
tion ad(F) of the graded Lie algebra M [1] satisfies (ad(F))2 = 0, so it defines a
complex on M (g) which turns out to be the Hoschild cohomology complex of the
associative algebra defined by F [11].

1.2. In the remaining of the paper, we use S p,q to denote the set of all (p, q)-
unshuffles, that is, elements σ in the permutation group S p+q satisfying σ (1) <
· · · < σ (p) and σ (p + 1) < · · · < σ (p + q).
     The theory of Lie algebra structures on g can also be described in a graded Lie
algebra framework [11, 19]. First, let Ma = Ma (g) be the space of skew symmetric
elements in M (g). One has Ma = ∑ Mak with Ma0 = g and Ma1 = End(g).
                                                 k≥0
Then consider Ma with shifted grading denoted by Ma [1], and define a graded Lie
                                              q                       p+q
bracket as follows: for all F ∈ Map [1], G ∈ Ma [1], then [F, G]a ∈ Ma [1] with
[F, G]a (X1 , . . . , X p+q+1 ) :=
               (−1) pq      ∑         ε (σ ) F(G(Xσ (1) , . . . , Xσ (q+1) ), Xσ (q+2) , . . . , Xσ (p+q+1) )
                         σ ∈Sq+1,p

                     −      ∑         ε (σ ) G(F(Xσ (1) , . . . , Xσ (p+1) ), Xσ (p+2) , . . . , Xσ (p+q+1) )
                         σ ∈S p+1,q

for X1 , . . . , X p+q+1 ∈ g.
   Notice that when X ∈ Ma−1 [1] = g, then
         [X , G]a (X1 , . . . , Xq ) = −G(X , X1 , . . . , Xq ) (= − ι X (G)(X1 , . . . , Xq )).

   Moreover, when F, G ∈ Ma0 [1] = End(g), then [F, G]a is the usual bracket of the
linear maps F and G.
   Now, any F ∈ Ma1 [1] defines a bracket on g by
                                  [X ,Y ] = F(X ,Y ), ∀ X ,Y ∈ g.
   The Jacobi identity is satisfied if and only if [F, F]a = 0. In this case, the deriva-
tion ad(F) of the graded Lie algebra Ma [1] satisfies (ad(F))2 = 0, so it defines a
complex on Ma which turns out to be the Chevalley cohomology complex with
coefficients in the adjoint representation, of the Lie algebra structure defined by F.
   At this point, let us quickly explain the relations between the two brackets
defined in 1.1 and 1.2. First, define the skew symmetrization map A : M (g) →
Ma (g):
                    A(F)(X1 , . . . , Xk ) =    ∑      ε (σ ) F(Xσ (1) , . . . , Xσ (k) )
                                               σ ∈Sk

with F ∈ M k (g) and X1 , . . . , Xk ∈ g. One has:
Proposition 1.2.1. For all F, G ∈ M (g), A([F, G]) = [A(F), A(G)]a .
    Obviously, when F ∈ M 1 [1] induces an associative product on g, then A(F)
induces a Lie algebra structure on g. However one should notice that from Propo-
sition 1.2.1, Lie algebra structures of type A(F) can be obtained from a “product”
F on g satisfying other conditions than associativity, for instance:
Proposition 1.2.2. Let F ∈ M 1 [1] such that there exists τ ∈ S3 satisfying
τ .[F, F] = −ε (τ ) [F, F]. Then A(F) defines a Lie algebra structure on g.

1.3.      Let us introduce a concept of generalized Lie algebra structures on g:
Definition 1.3.1. An element F ∈ Ma2k−1 [1] is a 2k-Lie algebra structure on g if
                                                [F, F]a = 0.
      We shall often use a bracket notation: for X1 , . . . , X2k ∈ g,
                                   [X1 , . . . , X2k ] = F(X1 , . . . , X2k ).
   The identity [F, F]a = 0 can be seen as a generalized Jacobi identity (see [9, 3]).
   Given a 2k-Lie algebra structure F on g, ad(F) is an odd derivation of Ma [1] and
satisfies (ad(F))2 = 0, so there is an associated cohomology defined by
ker(ad(F))/ Im(ad(F)), which can be interpreted as a generalization of the Cheval-
ley complex of 1.2.

  In this Section, with exception made to 2.3 and 2.5, we recall classical material
needed in the paper.
                                                                                                 V
2.1. We denote by D = D(g) the space of (graded) derivations of g. The space
                                                    V        V
D is graded by D = ∑nk=−1 D k with D ∈ D d if D( p g) ⊂ p+d g, for all p, and
has a graded Lie algebra structure with the bracket defined by:
                                                      ′                                      ′
(I)                 [D, D′ ] = D ◦ D′ − (−1)dd D′ ◦ D, ∀ D ∈ D d , D′ ∈ D d .
      We denote by ιX , X ∈ g, the elements of D −1 defined by
                                                                 ^
      ιX (Ω)(Y1 , . . . ,Yk ) := Ω(X ,Y1 , . . . ,Yk ), ∀ Ω ∈         k+1
                                                                            g, X ,Y1 , . . . ,Yk ∈ g (k ≥ 0),

  and ιX (1) = 0. When g is finite dimensional, given a basis {X1 , . . . , Xn } and its
dual basis {ω1 , . . . , ωn }, any element D ∈ D can be written in a unique way:
                                                     n
                                             D=     ∑ D r ∧ ιX    r
                                                    r=1

where Dr = D(ωr ). Moreover, D is a simple Lie superalgebra (often denoted by
W (n), see [20]) and there exists an obvious vector
                                              V
                                                    space isomorphism D : Ma [1] →
D defined as D(Ω ⊗ X ) = −Ω ∧ ιX , ∀ Ω ∈ g, X ∈ g which turns out to be a gla
isomorphism.
   Since we do not want to restrict ourselves to the finite dimensional case, we give
a proof of the following result:
Proposition 2.1.1. There exists a one to one gla homomorphism D : Ma [1] → D
such that
                                                                      ^
                            D(Ω ⊗ X ) = −Ω ∧ ιX , ∀ Ω ∈                     g, X ∈ g.
      When g is finite dimensional, D is an isomorphism.

Proof. Given a basis {Xr | r ∈ R} of g, and the forms ωr , r ∈ R, defined by
ωr (Xs ) = δrs , ∀r, s, for F ∈ Mak , let D(F) = − ∑r∈R t F(ωr ) ∧ ιXr . It is easy

see that though its indexes set is infinite, this sum applied to an element Ω ∈      g
gives:
D(F)(Ω)(Y1 , . . . ,Yk+w−1 ) =
                          −      ∑         ε (σ )Ω(F(Yσ (1) , . . . ,Yσ (k) ),Yσ (k+1) , . . . ,Yσ (k+w−1) ),

   for all Y1 , . . . ,Yk+w−1 ∈ g. It results that our definition of D does not depend on
                                                         V
the basis of g, and that D(A ⊗ X ) = −A ∧ ιX , A ∈ k g, X ∈ g. Keeping in mind the

   In the sequel, given F ∈ Ma (g), we denote by DF the associated derivation of
  g. If g is finite dimensional, for D ∈ D, we denote by FD the associated element
in Ma (g). Here are some examples:
Example 2.1.2. If T ∈ End(g) = Ma0 [1], then
                                                     p

for all Ω ∈           g, Y1 , . . . ,Yp ∈ g.

2.2. Let F be a Lie algebra structure on g, then F ∈ Ma1 [1] and [F, F]a = 0. Let
∂ = DF , then [∂ , ∂ ] = 0 gives ∂ 2 =V0 and formula (II) shows that the associated
complex in the Grassmann algebra g is exactly the Chevalley cohomology com-
plex of trivial cohomology of g. One defines θX :
                                        θX = [ιX , ∂ ] = Dad(X) .
   If {Xr | r ∈ R} is a basis of g, consider the forms ωr , r ∈ R, defined
                                                                     V
                                                                           by ωr (Xs ) =
δrs , ∀r, s. The map θ defines a Lie algebra representation of g in g and one has:
                                       1
(III)                              ∂ = ∑ ωr ∧ θXr .
                                       2 r∈R
   Let us precise that this formula is well-known when g is finite dimensional (see
[16]), and that a proof in the infinite dimensional case is given in the proof of
Lemma 3.3.7 of the present paper. InVany case, a very important consequence of
formula (III) is that any invariant in ( g)g is a cocycle.
2.3. Let us now check how 2.2 can be extended to 2k-Lie algebra structures on g.
Let F ∈ Ma2k−1 [1]. Assume that [F, F]a = 0, and let
(IV)                               [Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ] := F(Y1 , . . . ,Y2k )
                                                                                              V
for Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ∈ g. Denote by D = DF the associated derivation of g. Using
Proposition 2.1.1, one concludes D2 = 0, so one can define an associated cohomol-
ogy H ⋆ (F) = ker(D)/ Im(D). One has
                              Dω (Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ) = −ω ([Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ])
for ω ∈ g∗ , Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ∈ g. We shall come back to cohomology of 2k-Lie algebras
in Section 8.
   In the remaining of this Section, we will assume that g is a finite dimensional
vector space with dim g = n. We state next some properties of the Schouten bracket.
For more details, we refer to [17].
                                            V                                    V
2.4. Let W = W (g) = P ⊗ g, graded by W p = P ⊗ p g, where P is the
                      ∗ . Elements of W act as skew symmetric multivectors on
symmetric algebra of gV
P as follows: for Ω ∈ p g, P ∈ P, f1 , . . . , f p ∈ P,
                  (P ⊗ Ω)( f1 , . . . , f p )ϕ = P(ϕ ) Ω((d f1 )ϕ , . . . , (d f p )ϕ ).
  For instance, if {X1 , . . . , X p } is a basis of g and {ω1 , . . . , ω p } its dual basis, one
has for all i = 1, . . . , p:
                                               ∂f

  There is a natural ∧-product on W , defined by: for all P, P′ ∈ P, Ω, Ω′ ∈ g:
                            (P ⊗ Ω) ∧ (P′ ⊗ Ω′ ) = PP′ ⊗ (Ω ∧ Ω′ ).
   Each f ∈ P defines a derivation ι f of degree −1 of W by:
       ι f (P ⊗ Ω)( f1 , . . . , f p−1 )ϕ       = P(ϕ ) ι(d f )ϕ (Ω)((d f1 )ϕ , . . . , (d f p−1 )ϕ )
                                                = P(ϕ ) Ω((d f )ϕ , (d f1 )ϕ , . . . , (d f p−1 )ϕ ).

   For instance, if V ∈ W 1 , one has ι f (V ) = V ( f ). There is a graded Lie bracket on

   As a particular case, one has [Ω, Ω′ ]S = 0, for all Ω, Ω′ ∈ g.
   Let W ∈ W 1 [1], then W defines a Poisson bracket on P by {P, P′ } = W (P, P′ )
if and only if [W,W ]S = 0. More generally, as proposed in [3], one can define
Generalized Poisson Brackets (GPB) as follows:
Definition 2.4.1. An element W ∈ W 2k−1 [1] is a GPB if [W,W ]S = 0.
     (see [3] where these structures are introduced and applications are proposed).

2.5. Let us now show that 2k-Lie algebras have associated GPB, exactly as Lie
algebras have associated Poisson brackets. This will be a consequence of the fol-
lowing construction: define
                         V
                            a map V : D = D(g) → W by VD = V (D) := −X ⊗ Ω
for D = Ω ∧ ιX with Ω ∈ g, X ∈ g. Then, it is easy to check that:
Proposition 2.5.1. One has V[D,D′ ] = [VD ,VD′ ]S , for D, D′ ∈ D. Moreover V is a
one to one graded Lie algebras homomorphism from D into W [1].
   For example, given a 2k-Lie algebra structure F on g, denoted by [Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ] =
F(Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ∈ g, let D be the associated derivation (see Proposition
2.1.1) in D. Then one has:
                        VD ( f1 , . . . , f2k )ϕ = hϕ |[(d f1 )ϕ , . . . , (d f2k )ϕ ]i,
   and since [F, F]a = 0 by (2.1.1), one has [D, D] = 0 . Using Proposition 2.5.1
above, [VD ,VD ]S = 0, so VD defines a GPB on P.
   Finally, using 2.1 and Proposition 2.5.1, one deduces an inclusion of the sim-
ple Lie superalgebra W (n) into the graded Lie algebra W [1], endowed with the
Schouten bracket which provides a natural realization of W (n).

   In this Section, g denotes an associative algebra, with product m. We also use
the notation: X .Y = m(X ,Y ), ∀ X ,Y ∈ g. We assume that m has a unit 1m , but this
is not really necessary.

3.1.   We first define the iterated mk (k ≥ 0) of m as:
 m0 = 1m , m1 = Idg , m2 = m, . . . , mk (Y1 , . . . ,Yk ) = Y1 . . . . .Yk , ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Yk ∈ g, . . .
   It is easy to check that:
Proposition 3.1.1. For all k, k′ ≥ 0, one has:
                              [m2k , m2k′ ] = 0,
                            [m2k , m2k′ +1 ] = (2k − 1) m2k+2k′ ,
                          [m2k+1 , m2k′ +1 ] = 2(k − k′ ) m2k+2k′ +1 .
  Hence the space generated by {mk , k ≥ 0} is a subalgebra of the gla M (g) of
Section 1.
3.2.   Now define the standard polynomials Ak (k ≥ 0) on g as:
                                               Ak := A(mk )
   Using Propositions 1.2.1 and 3.1.1, one immediately obtains:
Proposition 3.2.1. For all k, k′ ≥ 0, one has:
                             [A2k , A2k′ ]a = 0,
                           [A2k , A2k′ +1 ]a = (2k − 1) A2k+2k′ ,
                         [A2k+1 , A2k′ +1 ]a = 2(k − k′ ) A2k+2k′ +1 .
   Let A be the subspace generated by {Ak , k ≥ 0}. Hence A is a subalgebra of
the graded Lie algebra Ma (g) of Section 1. The standard polynomial A2 is the Lie
algebra structure on g associated to m. Since [A2k , A2k ]a = 0, ∀k, we conclude:
Proposition 3.2.2. The standard polynomials A2k , k ≥ 1 define 2k-Lie algebra
structures on g.
   Remark that Ak is a g-invariant map from gk to g for the Lie algebra structure.
Moreover the standard polynomial A2k is a coboundary of the adjoint representa-
tion of the Lie algebra g whereas [A2 , A2k−1 ] = A2k .
3.3. Let us now define an associative product on A . First consider an associative
product ◦ on M (g):
             (F ◦ G)(Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ) = F(Y1 , . . . ,Yp ).G(Yp+1 , . . . ,Yp+q ),
for all F ∈ M p (g), G ∈ M q (g), Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ∈ g.
   Then define an associative product × on Ma (g) by:
(F × G)(Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ) =      ∑        ε (σ ) F(Yσ (1) , . . . ,Yσ (p) ) . G(Yσ (p+1) , . . . ,Yσ (p+q) ),
                                σ ∈S p,q

for all F ∈ Map (g), G ∈ Maq (g), Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ∈ g. By a straightforward computa-
tion, one has:
Proposition 3.3.1. For all F, G ∈ Ma (g), A(F ◦ G) = A(F) × A(G).
   It is obvious that mk = m1 ◦ · · · ◦ m1 , so:
                           |    {z       }
                                     k times

Corollary 3.3.2. Ak = A1 × · · · × A1 , for all k ≥ 1 and Ak × Aℓ = Aℓ × Ak =
                      |    {z       }
                                         k times
Ak+ℓ , for all k, ℓ ≥ 0.
   As a consequence, A is a commutative algebra for the ×-product.
   Any element Z ∈ g defines a super derivation ιZ of degree −1 of the ×-product
of Ma (g) by: for all F ∈ Map (g), Y1 , . . . ,Yp−1 ∈ g,
                          ιZ (F)(Y1 , . . . ,Yp−1 ) := F(Z,Y1 , . . . ,Yp−1 ),
  Denote by Z(g) the center of the algebra g. If Z ∈ Z(g), one has ιZ (A2 ) = 0.
Hence using Corollary 3.3.2 and the derivation property of ιZ , we deduce:
Proposition 3.3.3. Assume that Z ∈ Z(g). Then for all k,
                            ιZ (A2k ) = 0 and ιZ (A2k+1 ) = Z . A2k .
   This Proposition expresses classical identities on standard polynomials, gener-
ally written in the case Z = 1m .
   Let us now assume that g is equipped with a trace, that is, a linear form Tr: g →
C satisfying:
                           Tr(X .Y ) = Tr(Y.X ), ∀ X ,Y ∈ g.
        V
  Let g be Vthe Grassmann algebra of g. We extend the trace Tr to a map
Tr: Ma (g) → g defined by:
                            Tr(F)(Y1 , . . . ,Yp ) = Tr(F(Y1 , . . . ,Yp )),
for all F ∈   Map (g), Y1 , . . . ,Yp     ∈ g.
Proposition 3.3.4. One has Tr(F × G) = (−1) pq Tr(G × F), for all F ∈ Map (g),
      q
G ∈ Ma (g).
Proof. Let F ∈ Map (g), G ∈ Maq (g), Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ∈ g:
 Tr(F × G)(Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ) =
                 =     ∑        ε (σ )    Tr(F(Yσ (1) , . . . ,Yσ (p) ) . G(Yσ (p+1) , . . . ,Yσ (p+q) ))
                     σ ∈S p,q

                 =     ∑        ε (σ )    Tr(G(Yσ (p+1) , . . . ,Yσ (p+q) ) . F(Yσ (1) , . . . ,Yσ (p) ))
                     σ ∈S p,q

   Given σ ∈ S p,q , define τ ∈ Sq,p as τ (1) = σ (p + 1), . . . , τ (q) = σ (p + q) and
τ (q + 1) = σ (1), . . . , τ (q + p) = σ (p). Then one has ε (τ ) = (−1) pq ε (σ ), so:
               Tr(F × G)(Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ) =
        = (−1) pq          ∑      ε (τ ) Tr(G(Yτ (1) , . . . ,Yτ (q) ) . F(Yτ (q+1) , . . . ,Yτ (p+q) ))
                        τ ∈Sq,p
        = (−1) pq Tr(G × F)(Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ).
                                                                                                            
                          NEW APPLICATIONS OF GRADED LIE ALGEBRAS                                                        13

                                                                                                 V
   Hence our extension of the trace has, in fact, the properties of a g-valued super
trace on the graded algebra (Ma (g), ×). Denoting the super bracket associated to
the ×-product on Ma (g) by:
             [F, G]× = F × G − (−1) pq G × F, ∀ F ∈ Map (g), G ∈ Maq (g),
   one obtains
Corollary 3.3.5. Tr([F, G]× ) = 0.
Proposition 3.3.6. One has Tr(A2k ) = 0 (k ≥ 1) and Tr(A2k+1 ) (k ≥ 0) is an in-
variant cocycle for the (trivial) cohomology of the Lie algebra g.
Proof. For the first claim, use [A1 , A2k−1 ]× = 2 A2k and apply the Corollary above.
For the second,
              V g
                 we remark that A2k+1 is a g-invariant map from g2k+1 into g, so
Tr(A2k+1 ) ∈ ( g) and therefore a cocycle by the following classical Lemma. 
                                                                                                            V
Lemma 3.3.7. Let h be a Lie algebra. Then any invariant cochain in ( h)h is a
cocycle.
Proof. If h is finite dimensional, the result is well known ([16]) and is a direct con-
sequence of the formula ∂ = 21 ∑ni=1 ωi ∧ θXi where ∂ is the differential, {X1 , . . . , Xn }
a basis of h and {ω1 , . . . , ωn } its dual basis.
   For the sake of completeness, we give a proof in the general case, let {Xi | i ∈ I}
be a basis of h, and {ωi | i ∈ I} be the forms defined by ωi (X j ) = δi j , ∀ i, j. We
claim that the formula ∂ = 21 ∑i∈I ωi ∧ θXi is still valid. To prove this, let D =
                                                                                       Vp

and Y1 , . . . ,Yp+1 ∈ h, one has:

14                        GEORGES PINCZON, ROSANE USHIROBIRA

     Now recall the well-known formula (e.g. [15]):
Proposition 3.3.8. Tr(A2k+1 (Y1 , . . . ,Y2k+1 )) = (2k + 1) Tr(A2k (Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ).Y2k+1 ),
for all Y1 , . . . ,Y2k+1 ∈ g.
   This formula will be reinterpreted in Section 6 in terms of cyclic cohomology
of the Lie algebra g: A2k is a cocycle of the adjoint action (actually a coboundary
since [A2 , A2k−1 ] = A2k ), and Proposition 3.3.8 tells that it is a cyclic cocycle, as
will be defined in Section 6.
Example 3.3.9. Assume that g = gl(n). Then H ⋆ (g) can be completely described
in terms of standard polynomials (see e.g. [15] or [10]):
                     H ⋆ (g) = Ext[Tr(A1 ), Tr(A3 ), . . . , Tr(A2n−1 )].
     Moreover, by the Amitsur-Levitzki theorem ([1, 15]):
                                      Ak = 0, if k ≥ 2n.
   So dim A = 2n. For the ×-product, A ≃ C[X ]/X 2n . For the graded bracket, the
structure of A is given by formula (IV), A2 is the Lie algebra structure on g and
the standard polynomials A4 , . . . , A2n−2 define 2k-Lie algebra structures on g by
Proposition 3.2.1.
Example 3.3.10. More generally, let V be an infinite dimensional vector space.
Let g be the space of finite rank linear maps. So g is an ideal of the associative
algebra End(V ). There is a vector spaces isomorphism g ≃ V ∗ ⊗ V defined by
(ω ⊗ v)(v′ ) = ω (v′ ) v, for all v, v′ ∈ V , ω ∈ V ∗ . So we can define the trace Tr(X )
when X ∈ g by Tr(ω ⊗ v) := ω (v), for all ω ∈ V ∗ , v ∈ V . It is easy to check
that Tr([X ,Y ]) = 0, for all X , Y ∈ g, so the preceding results apply. Moreover, the
symmetric bilinear form B defined on g by B(X ,Y ) = Tr(XY ) is non degenerate and
invariant, therefore g is a quadratic Lie algebra. Since gl(n) ⊂ g, ∀ n, by Example
3.3.9, we can conclude that
                   Ext[Tr(A1 ), Tr(A3 ), . . . , Tr(A2n−1 ), . . . ] ⊂ H ⋆ (g)
Proposition 3.3.11. Let a2n+1 = Tr(A2n+1 ). Then
                           H ⋆ (g) = Ext[a1 , a3 , . . . , a2n+1 , . . . ].
Proof. Recall that for any Lie algebra h, there is an isomorphism H k (h) ≃ Hk (h)∗ ,
induced by the restriction Ω ∈ Z k (h) 7→ Ω|Zk (h) where Hk (h) is the homology of h
defined as Hk (h) = Zk (h)/Bk (h) (with Zk (h) the cycles and Bk (h) the boundaries).
   Let us define S = {S = (W,W ′ ) | W,W ′ complementary subspaces of V with
dim(W ) < ∞} and for S = (W,W ′ ) ∈ S , gS = {X ∈ g | X (V ) ⊂ W, X (W ′ ) = {0}}.
Then gS is a subalgebra of the (associative or Lie) algebra g and one has gS ≃
gl(dim(W )). It is easy to check that given X1 ,, . . . , Xr ∈ g, there exists S ∈ S such
that Xi ∈ gS , ∀i = 1, . . . , r. It results that, if c ∈ Extk (g), there exists S such that
c ∈ Extk (gS ), so that Extk (g) = ∪S∈S Extk (gS ).
   Set E = Ext[a1 , a3 , . . . , a2n+1 , . . . ] ⊂ H ⋆ (g) and E k = E ∩ H k (g). Then dim(E k )
= ♯ Ik with Ik = {(i j ) ∈ {0, 1}N | ∑ j∈N (2 j + 1) i j = k}. We fix a basis {Ωi | i ∈ Ik }
of E k .

   Given c ∈ Zk (g), denote by c its class in Hk (g). Let us assume that Ωi (c) = 0,
∀i ∈ Ik . Take S ∈ S such that c ∈ Extk (gS ), then by (3.3.9), {Ωi | i ∈ Ik } generates
H k (gS ) = Hk (gS )∗ and since c ∈ Zk (gS ), it results that c ∈ Bk (gS ) ⊂ Bk (g), therefore
c = 0. So, {Ωi | i ∈ Ik } is free in Hk (g)∗ and ∩i∈Ik ker(Ωi ) = {0}. It results that
dim(Hk (g)) = ♯ Ik . Since H k (g) = Hk (g)∗ , one has dim(H k (g)) = ♯ Ik and since
E k ⊂ H k (g), one obtains E k = H k (g).                                                   
Remark 3.3.12. From H 1 (g) = C Tr, we deduce that [g, g] = ker(Tr). From H 2 (g) =
{0}, we deduce that g has no (non trivial) central extension.

   The canonical Poisson bracket on R2n appears as the leading term of a quanti-
zation of the algebra of polynomial functions by the Weyl algebra, the so-called
Moyal product. We will develop a similar formalism, replacing polynomials (i.e.
commuting variables) by skew multilinear forms (i.e. skew commuting variables)
and the Weyl algebra by the Clifford algebra. The leading term of the deformation
will be the super Poisson bracket.
4.1. Let us give a definition of the Clifford algebra that is well adapted to the
realization of this algebra as a deformation of the exterior algebra. Denote by Ct ,
t ∈ C, the associative algebra with basis {eI , I ∈ Zn2 } and product defined by
                                 eI ⋆ eJ = (−1)Ω(I,J) t |IJ| eI + J
                                                                 (2)

where Ω is the bilinear form associated to the matrix (ai j )ni, j=1 with ai j = 1 if i > j
and 0 otherwise.
   Take Ii = ( jk ) ∈ Zn2 , with ji = 1 and 0 otherwise. Set ei = eIi , i = 1, . . . , n and
V = span{e1 , . . . , en }. When t = 0, one obtains C0 = Ext(V ). When t 6= 0, Ct is the
Clifford algebra. The following relations hold:
                         e2i = t, ∀ i,     ei ⋆ e j + e j ⋆ ei = 0, i 6= j,
             ei1 ⋆ ei2 ⋆ · · · ⋆ ei p = ei1 ∧ ei2 ∧ · · · ∧ ei p , if i1 < i2 < · · · < i p
   So that Ct is the quotient algebra of the tensor algebra T (V ) by the relations:
                                  v ⊗ v = t. B(v, v). 1, v ∈ V,
where B is the bilinear form B(ei , e j ) = δi j , for all i, j, and we recover the usual
definition of the Clifford algebra.
   But, we are mainly interested in realizing Ct as a deformation of Ext(V ). Using:
                                t k = 0k + t δk,1 + t 2 δk,2 + . . . .
   this deformation becomes transparent:
Proposition 4.1.1. One has
                                                         n
                            eI ⋆ eJ = eI ∧ eJ + ∑ t k Dk (eI , eJ )
                                                        k=1

where Dk (eI , eJ ) = δ|IJ|,k   (−1)Ω(I,J)   eI + J .

     Symmetry properties of the coefficients are resumed in:
                                                                          ′
Proposition 4.1.2. For all Ω ∈ Extw (V ), Ω′ ∈ Extw (V ),
                                                                      ′
                                D j (Ω, Ω′ ) = (−1) j (−1)ww D j (Ω′ , Ω).
  We insist on the fact that Ct is not a Z-graded, but only a Z2 -graded algebra.
The associated Lie superalgebra has bracket:
                                  [Ω, Ω′ ]⋆ = 2   ∑     t 2p+1 D2p+1 (Ω, Ω′ ).
                                                  p≥0

Definition 4.1.3. We define the super Poisson bracket on Ext(V ) by:
                             {Ω, Ω′ } = 2 D1 (Ω, Ω′ ), ∀ Ω, Ω′ ∈ Ext(V ).
   Since [., .]⋆ satisfies the super Jacobi identity, so does {., .}. Moreover, since
ad⋆ (Ω) is derivation of the Ct -product, adP (Ω) := {Ω, .} is a derivation of the ∧-
product (actually of degree (w − 2) if Ω ∈ Extw (V )).
   Finally, by a straightforward computation, one gets:
(V)      {v1 ∧ · · · ∧ v p , w1 ∧ . . . ∧        wq } = 2 (−1) p+1 ×
        ∑         (−1)i+ j B(vi , w j ) v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vbi ∧ · · · ∧ v p ∧ w1 ∧ · · · ∧ w
                                                                                      cj ∧ · · · ∧ wq ,
      i=1,...,p
      j=1,...,q
for all v1 , . . . , v p , w1 , . . . , wq ∈ V .
   Comparing with the formulas given in [20], we conclude that the Lie superal-
                                                             e
gebra Ext(V )/C is isomorphic to the simple Lie superalgebra H(n).  Notice that
                                                 ∗
Ext(V )/C ≃ adP (Ext(V )) ⊂ Der(Ext(V )) = D(V ), so we obtain the classical in-
          e
clusion H(n)         ⊂ W (n) ([20]).
4.2. Let us modify slightly the formalism in 4.1 in order to apply it to Lie algebras
deformation theory. We begin with a n-dimensional vector space g and we set
V = g∗ . We assume that g is a quadratic space with bilinear form B. Denote by
{X1 , . . . , Xn } an orthonormal basis of g and by {ω1 , . . . , ωn } the dual basis; we
define B on g∗ by B(ωi , ω j ) = δi j . Applying the
                                                   V
                                                     construction in 4.1 with ei = ωi ,
i = 1, . . . , n, we get a super Poisson bracket on g and it is easy to check that:
                                            Vw              V
Proposition 4.2.1. For all Ω ∈                    g, Ω′ ∈       g, one has
                                                            n
                             {Ω, Ω′ } = 2 (−1)w+1          ∑ ιX (Ω) ∧ ιX (Ω′ ).
                                                                  j           j

   This formula is valid in any orthonormal basis of g and it is enough for our
purpose in Section 4, but a general formula can be found in Lemma 5.3.1. There is a
Moyal type formula which gives the V  Clifford

Proposition 4.2.2.
                               Ω ⋆ Ω′ = m∧ ◦ exp(−tF )(Ω ⊗ Ω′ ).
Proof. As in the beginning of 4.2, let ei = ωi and let ∂i = ιXi , i = 1, . . . , n. As
in 4.1, for I = (i1 , . . . , in ) ∈ Zn2 , let eI = ei11 ∧ · · · ∧ einn and ∂I = ∂1i1 ◦ · · · ◦ ∂nin . For
J = ( j1 , . . . , jn ) ∈ Zn2 , let J I = j1i1 . . . jnin . One has ∂I (eJ ) = (−1)Ω(I,J) J I eI + J . Since
                                                                                                       (2)

all ∂i ⊗ ∂i commute, and ∂i2 = 0, one has:
                                      !k
                                    ∑ ∂i ⊗ ∂i               = k!   ∑ ∂I ⊗ ∂I
                                     i                             |I|=k

   For k > 0, one has:
                 m∧ ◦ F k (eR ⊗ eS )
                                                                                           !k
           = (−1) (−1)  |R|      |R|−1
                                         . . . (−1)       |R|−(k−1)
                                                                      m∧ ◦     ∑ ∂i ⊗ ∂i         (eR ⊗ eS )
                                                                                i

                                                 ∑ (−1)Ω(I,R) (−1)Ω(I,S) RI SI eI + R ∧ eI + S
                                   k(k−1)
           = (−1)k|R| (−1)            2     k!
                                                                                               (2)     (2)
                                                 |I|=k

   This vanishes, except if k = |RS|, and in that case, the only remaining term in
the sum is when I = RS. We compute this term:
                                                 k(k−1)
m∧ ◦F k (eR ⊗ eS ) = (−1)k|R| (−1)                  2     k!(−1)Ω(RS,R)+Ω(RS,S)(−1)Ω(RS+R,RS+S)eR+ S
                                                                                                              (2)

   But one has Ω(A, B) + Ω(B, A) = |A||B| − |AB|, so:
                                                                                             k(k − 1)
           Ω(RS, R) + Ω(RS, S) = k|R| − k,                      and        Ω(RS, RS) =                .
                                                                                                 2
   So finally, we have proved that
                    m∧ ◦ F k (eR ⊗ eS ) = (−1)k k!(−1)Ω(R,S) δ|RS|,k eR+ S
                                                                                           (2)

   On the other hand, by Proposition 4.1.1, one has
                                                                           n
                         eR ⋆ eS = eR ∧ eS + (−1)Ω(R,S) ∑ δ|RS|,k eR+ S
                                                                                     (2)
                                                                       k=1

   so the result follows.                                                                                      
Remark 4.2.3. An equivalent formula is given in [14], but without the use of super
Poisson bracket.
                                                                                           V

tions:

Proposition 4.3.1. A derivation D = ∑r Dr ∧ ιXr is Hamiltonian if and only if
ιXr (Ds ) + ιXs (Dr ) = 0, ∀ r, s.
Proof. When the condition is satisfied, one has D = adP (Ω) where Ω =                  1
                                                                                      2w   ∑r D r ∧
ωr and w = deg(D) + 2.                                                                           
Remark 4.3.2. A Hamiltonian derivation is a derivation of the ∧-product and also
of the super Poisson bracket.
     In fact, one has:
Proposition 4.3.3. Let D ∈ D. Then D is Hamiltonian if and only if D is a deriva-
tion of the super Poisson bracket.
                                             V
Proof. Let D = ∑r Dr ∧ ιXr with D ∈ d g, then Dr = D(ωr ). Since {ωr , ωs } ∈ C,
assuming that D is a derivation of the super Poisson bracket, one has:
                    0 = D({ωr , ωs }) = 2 (−1)d+1 (ιXr (Ds ) + ιXs (Dr ))
and the result follows by Proposition 4.3.1.                                                    
4.4. We now want to apply super Poisson brackets to the theory of quadratic Lie
algebras, in a deformation framework that we will quickly set up. Given a quadratic
Lie algebra (g0 , B0 ) with bilinear form B0 and product [., .], a deformation (gt , Bt )
of (g0 , B0 ) is:
    (1) a deformation gt of g in the usual sense, so:
                       [X ,Y ]t = [X ,Y ] + tC1 (X ,Y ) + . . . , ∀ X ,Y ∈ g,
      (2) a formal bilinear form Bt = B0 + tB1 + . . . such that
                       Bt ([X ,Y ]t , Z) = −Bt (Y, [X , Z]t ), ∀ X ,Y, Z ∈ g,
  Two deformations (gt , Bt ) and (gt′ , Bt′ ) with respective brackets [., .]t and [., .]t′ are
equivalent if there exists Tt = Id +tT1 + . . . such that:
  [X ,Y ]t′ = Tt−1 ([Tt (X ), Tt (Y )])   and    Bt′ (X ,Y ) = Bt (Tt (X ), Tt (Y )), ∀ X ,Y ∈ g.
Proposition 4.4.1. Any deformation (gt , Bt ) of (g0 , B0 ) is equivalent to a deforma-
tion with unchanged bilinear form.
Proof. Fix an orthonormal basis {e1 , . . . , en } of g with respect to B0 . By a Gram-
Schmidt type strategy, one can construct {e1 (t), . . . , en (t)} such that:
                  eℓ (t) = λ1 (t)e1 (t) + · · · + λℓ−1 (t)eℓ−1 (t) + eℓ , ∀ℓ ≤ n,
   with λ j (t) ∈ t C[[t]], and Bt (eℓ (t), em (t)) = 0, for all ℓ, m ≤ n. Since
[Bt (eℓ (t), eℓ (t))]t=0 = B0 (eℓ , eℓ ) = 1, ∀ℓ ≤ n, Bt (eℓ (t), eℓ (t)) is invertible, and
                                                    1
                               e′ℓ (t) =                        1 eℓ (t)
                                          (Bt (eℓ (t), eℓ (t))) 2
does satisfy Bt (e′ℓ (t), e′m (t)) = δℓm , ∀ℓ, m.
  Now if we define Tt by Tt (eℓ ) = e′ℓ (t), ∀ℓ ≤ n, and a new deformation
                          [X ,Y ]t = Tt ([Tt (X ), Tt (Y )]t ), ∀X ,Y ∈ g,

   with bilinear form Bt′ (X ,Y ) = Bt (Tt (X ), Tt (Y )) = B0 (X ,Y ), ∀X , Y ∈ g, we obtain
a deformation that is equivalent to the initial one.                                       
  So if one want to study quadratic Lie algebras in terms of deformation theory,
one can restrict to quadratic Lie algebras with a specified bilinear form, and that is
what we shall do next.

4.5. The constructions made in the beginning of this section can now be applied
as follows: given a finite dimensional quadratic
                                           V
                                                 Lie algebra g with bilinear form
B, let ∂ be the corresponding derivation of g (i.e. the differential of the trivial
cohomology complex of g, see 2.2), we define:
                        I(X ,Y, Z) := B([X ,Y ], Z), ∀ X ,Y, Z ∈ g
   Then one has:
Proposition 4.5.1.
            V
   (1) I ∈ ( 3 g)g .
   (2) ∂ = − 21 adP (I).
   (3) {I, I} = 0.
Proof. The assertion (1) is obvious. To show (2), let {X1 , . . . , Xn } be an orthonor-
mal basis of g and {ω1 , . . . , ωn } the dual basis. Then for all Y , Z ∈ g:
                                                      !
    1
  − adP (I)(ωi )(Y, Z) = − ∑ ιX j (I) ∧ ιX j (ωi ) (Y, Z) = −B([Xi,Y ], Z) =
    2                               j
                                    = −B(Xi, [Y, Z]) = −ωi ([Y, Z]) = ∂ ωi (Y, Z)
   Hence, ∂ = − 12 adP (I).
   Finally adP ({I, I}) = [adP (I), adP (I)] = 4[∂ , ∂ ] = 8∂ 2 = 0. So {I, I} = 0 and that
proves (3).                                                                              
   Note that ∂ , ιX and θX = [ιX , ∂ ], ∀ X ∈ g are all Hamiltonian derivations.
4.6. Conversely, assume that g is (only) a finite dimensional quadratic vector
              V
space. Fix I ∈ 3 g and define ∂ = − 12 adP (I). Then the formula
                                                             ^
               adP {Ω, Ω′ } = [adP (Ω), adP (Ω′ )], ∀ Ω, Ω′ ∈ g
   leads to
(VI)                       [∂ , ∂ ] = 0 if and only if {I, I} = 0.
  Let F = F∂ be the structure on g associated to ∂ (see 2.1 and 2.2), then from
(VI), it follows:
Proposition 4.6.1. F is a Lie algebra structure if and only if {I, I} = 0. In that
case, with the notation [X ,Y ] = F(X ,Y ), one has:
                        I(X ,Y, Z) = B([X ,Y ], Z), ∀ X ,Y, Z ∈ g,
   the form B is invariant and g is a quadratic Lie algebra.
20                          GEORGES PINCZON, ROSANE USHIROBIRA

Proof. We have to prove that if F is a Lie algebra structure, then I(X ,Y, Z) =
B([X ,Y ], Z), ∀ X ,Y, Z ∈ g.
    Let {X1 , . . . , Xn } be an orthonormal basis, then ∂ = − ∑k ιXk (I) ∧ ιXk , so F =
∑k ιXk (I) ⊗ Xk , and therefore B([Xi , X j ], Xk ) = ιXk (I)(Xi , X j ) = I(Xi , X j , Xk ), for all
i, j, k.                                                                                           
                                                                    V
Remark 4.6.2. Using 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, it appears that g[2] with super Poisson
bracket is a gla associated to deformation theory of finite dimensional quadratic Lie
algebras: by 4.4, one can assume that B does not change, then quadratic Lie algebra
                                                                                        V
structures with the same B are in one to one correspondence with elements I ∈ 3 g
such that {I, I} = 0 (4.5, 4.6). An equivalent description   V
                                                                   canVbe givenVin terms of
Hamiltonian derivations, i.e. of the gla H (g) = adP ( g) ≃ g/C = Q g.
   Let us note that in this picture, one has to redefine equivalence: a priori, one
might think that equivalence should be defined as Lie algebras isomorphism keep-
ing B fixed. But this is too restrictive, since [., .] and λ (t)[., .], with λ (t) = 1+t(. . . )
will not be equivalent in that sense as they should be. So one has rather to work
with the notion of a conformal equivalence, i.e. an equivalence defined by a Lie
algebras isomorphism T (t) = Id +t(. . . )satisfying B(Tt (X ), Tt (Y )) = µ (t)B(X ,Y ),
with µ (t) = 1 + t(. . . ). This will change the corresponding gla : one can consider
the subalgebra CR ⊕ H (g) of D(g) (where R = ∑i ωi ∧ ιXi is the super radial vec-
tor field), rather than H (g). Hence, there are some adaptations to carry out, which
will not be developed here since they are somewhat standard. Let us only indicate
that in this framework, if (g0 , B0 ) is the initial quadratic Lie algebra with associ-
            V
ated I0 ∈ 3 (g), then the first obstruction to triviality of a quadratic deformation
will lie in H 3 (g)/C I0 . For instance, if g0 is semisimple, it is shown in [16] that
H 3 (g0 ) and the space of symmetric invariant bilinear forms on g0 are isomorphic,
the isomorphism being B 7→ IB where IB (X ,Y, Z) = B([X ,Y ], Z), ∀ X , Y , Z ∈ g. It
results that when g0 is simple, it is rigid in quadratic deformation theory.

5.1.   First, let us recall two results:
Proposition 5.1.1. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space and I a k-form in
Vk
   V . Denote by VI the orthogonal subspace in V ∗ of the subspace {X ∈ V | ιX (I) =
0}. Then dim(VI ) ≥ k and if I is non zero, I is decomposable if and only if dimVI =
k. In this case, if {ω1 , . . . , ωk } is a basis of VI , one has I = α ω1 ∧ · · · ∧ ωk , for
some α ∈ C ([4]).
Proposition 5.1.2. Let V be a finite dimensional quadratic vector space with a non
degenerate symmetric bilinear form B. For a subspace W of V , denote by W ⊥ its
                                                     ∗
orthogonal subspace in V with respect to B and W ⊥ its orthogonal in V ∗ . Let φ
be the isomorphism from V onto V ∗ induced by B. Then φ |W ⊥ is an isomorphism
                  ∗
from W ⊥ onto W ⊥ , so dim(W ⊥ ) = dim(V ) − dim(W ). One has V = W ⊕ W ⊥ if
and only if W ∩W ⊥ = {0} and in this case the restriction of B to W or W ⊥ is non
degenerate.

   In the rest of this Section, g will denote a finite dimensional quadratic Lie alge-
bra with bilinear form B. Denote by Z(g) the center of g and by Ig the element of
V3
    g defined by Ig (X ,Y, Z) = B([X ,Y ], Z), ∀ X , Y , Z ∈ g.
Definition 5.1.3. We say that g is an elementary quadratic Lie algebra if Ig is
decomposable.
   Remark that the obvious identity Z(g)⊥ = [g, g] holds here. As a consequence,
Proposition 5.1.4. Let g be a non Abelian quadratic Lie algebra. Then dim([g, g]) ≥
3. Moreover, g is elementary if and only if the equality holds.
                                                   ∗
Proof. Since Z(g)⊥ = [g, g] and VIg = Z(g)⊥ , the result follows directly from
Proposition 5.1.1.                                                           
Corollary 5.1.5. Let g be an elementary quadratic Lie algebra. Then all codjoint
orbits have dimension at most 2.
Proof. Let ω ∈ g∗ and Xω ∈ g such that ω = φ (Xω ). Then ad(g)(ω ) = φ ([g, Xω ]) ⊂
φ ([g, g]), so dim(ad(g)(ω )) ≤ 3 and since all coadjoint orbits have even dimension,
the result is proved.                                                              
Remark 5.1.6. Suppose that g is (only) a finite dimensional quadratic vector space
                                        V
and let I be a decomposable 3-vector in 3 g. Then it is easy to check that {I, I} = 0
for the super Poisson bracket. So by Proposition 4.6.1 there is a quadratic elemen-
tary Lie algebra structure on g such that I(X ,Y, Z) = B([X ,Y ], Z), ∀ X , Y , Z ∈ g.
   In the sequel, we will classify all elementary non Abelian quadratic Lie algebras.
Our proof is a two steps one: first, in 5.2, we demonstrate a result on quadratic
Lie algebras that reduces the classification problem to small dimensions, namely
between 3 and 6. Then in 5.3, we proceed by classifying these small dimensional
elementary quadratic algebras. Explicit commutations in a canonical basis with
respect to B are computed as well.
5.2.   Here is the reduction result on quadratic Lie algebras:
Proposition 5.2.1. Let g be a non Abelian quadratic Lie algebra with bilinear form
B. Then there exist a central ideal z and an ideal l 6= {0} such that:
       (1) One has g = z ⊕ l, and l and z are orthogonal with respect to B.
       (2) The ideals z and l are quadratic (with bilinear forms induced by the re-
           striction of B) and l is non Abelian. Moreover, l is elementary if and only
           if g is elementary.
       (3) The center Z(l) is totally isotropic and one has
                                          1
                            dim(Z(l)) ≤ dim(l) ≤ dim([l, l]).
                                          2
Proof. Let z0 = Z(g) ∩ [g, g]. Fix any subspace z such that Z(g) = z0 ⊕ z. Since
Z(g)⊥ = [g, g], one has B(z0 , z) = {0} and z ∩ z⊥ = {0}. It results from Proposition
5.1.2 that g = z ⊕ l where l = z⊥ .
     Since B([g, g], z) = {0}, one has [g, g] ⊂ l. It is easy to check that Z(l) = z0 and
[l, l] = [g, g] = Z(g)⊥ so Z(l) is totally isotropic; moreover the restriction of B to z is
22                          GEORGES PINCZON, ROSANE USHIROBIRA

not degenerate, so l is quadratic and clearly non Abelian since z is central in g. If g
is elementary, l is a fortiori elementary. If l is elementary, let Il = ω1 ∧ ω2 ∧ ω3 , ω1 ,
ω2 , ω3 ∈ l∗ , extend the ωi to g by ωi |z = 0. Since Ig (X ,Y, Z) = 0, ∀X ∈ z, Y , Z ∈ g,
one concludes Ig = ω1 ∧ ω2 ∧ ω3 , hence g is elementary. Finally Z(l) ⊂ [l, l] = Z(l)⊥
implies dim(l) − dim([l, l]) ≤ dim([l, l]) and the last inequality follows.             
Corollary 5.2.2. Let l be an elementary non zero quadratic Lie algebra such that
Z(l) is totally isotropic. Then one has
                                         3 ≤ dim(l) ≤ 6.
Proof. Use Propositions 5.2.1(3) and 5.1.4.                                                           
5.3. We shall now finish the classification of non Abelian elementary quadratic
Lie algebras. This classification is reduced, by Proposition 5.2.1 and Corollary
5.2.2, to the case of non zero elementary quadratic l with a totally isotropic center
Z(l). Applying Proposition 5.2.2 one has 3 ≤ dim(l) ≤ 6. Note that if dim(l) = 3,
one has l = [l, l] (Proposition 5.1.4), so l ≃ sl(2) and B is the Killing form up to a
scalar. So we have to consider dim(l) ≥ 4 (therefore dim(Z(l)) ≥ 1).
   We need the following Lemma:
Lemma 5.3.1. Let V be a quadratic vector space with bilinear form B. Define B on
V ∗ by B(ω , ω ′ ) := B(φ −1 (ω ), φ −1 (ω ′ )), ∀ ω , ω ′ ∈ V ∗ (φ as in Proposition 5.1.2).
Let {ω1 , . . . , ωn } be a basis of V ∗ , {X1 , . . . , Xn } its dual basis and {Y1 ,V. . . ,Yn } the
basis of g defined by Yi = φ −1 (ωi ). Then the super Poisson bracket on g is given
by
                                                                           ^                 ^
      {Ω, Ω′ } = 2 (−1)w+1 ∑ B(Yi ,Y j )ιXi (Ω) ∧ ιX j (Ω′ ), Ω ∈              w
                                                                                   g, Ω′ ∈       g.
                                  i, j

Proof. Using Proposition 4.2.1, one has
                       {Ω, Ω′ } = 2 (−1)w+1 ∑ αi j ιXi (Ω) ∧ ιX j (Ω′ ),
                                                   i, j
          Vw                V
  Ω ∈         g, Ω′ ∈ g and αi j =                 2 {ωi , ω j }.
                                                   1
                                                                     But from 4.1, one has
{ωi , ω j } = 2B(ωi , ω j ) = 2B(Yi ,Y j ).                                             
Proposition 5.3.2. Let l be an elementary quadratic Lie algebra with non zero
totally isotropic center Z(l). Then:
    (1) If dim(l) = 6, there exists a basis {Z1 , Z2 , Z3 , X1 , X2 , X3 } of l such that:
           (i) {Z1 , Z2 , Z3 } is a basis of Z(l).
          (ii) B(Zi , Z j ) = B(Xi , X j ) = 0, B(Zi , X j ) = δi j , ∀ i, j.
         (iii) [X1 , X2 ] = Z3 , [X2 , X3 ] = Z1 , [X3 , X1 ] = Z2 and the other brackets van-
               ish.
    (2) If dim(l) = 5, there exists a basis {Z1 , Z2 , X1 , X2 , T } of l such that:
           (i) {Z1 , Z2 } is a basis of Z(l).
          (ii) B(Zi , Z j ) = B(Xi , X j ) = 0, B(Zi , X j ) = δi j , ∀ i, j, B(T, Zi ) = B(T, Xi) =
               0, B(T, T ) = 1.
         (iii) [X1 , T ] = −Z2 , [X2 , T ] = Z1 , [X1 , X2 ] = T and the other brackets van-
               ish.

    (3) If dim(l) = 4, then dim(Z(l)) = 1 and there exist totally isotropic subspaces
        i with basis {Z, P} and i′ with basis {X , Q} such that Z(l) ⊂ i ⊂ [l, l], l =
        i ⊕ i′ and :
          (i) Z(l) = C Z, B(Z, X ) = B(P, Q) = 1, B(Z, Q) = B(X , P) = 0.
         (ii) [X , P] = P, [X , Q] = −Q, [P, Q] = Z and the other brackets vanish.
Proof.
   (1) Assuming that dim(l) = 6, one has dim(Z(l)) = 3, so Z(l) = [l, l] = Z(l)⊥ .
       Using [4], there is a totally isotropic subspace l′ such that l = Z(l) ⊕ l′ .
       With the notation of Proposition 5.1.2, since φ |l′ is an isomorphism from l′
       onto Z(l)∗ , we can find a basis {Z1 , Z2 , Z3 } of Z(l) and a basis {X1 , X2 , X3 }
       of l′ such that B(Zi , X j ) = δi j . Then
                    ∗
             Z(l)⊥ = span{X1∗ , X2∗ , X3∗ } = span{φ (Z1 ), φ (Z2 ), φ (Z3 )}.
                                                                            ∗
           Let Il = B([X ,Y ], Z), ∀ X ,Y, Z ∈ l. Since VIl = Z(l)⊥ , it results from
        Proposition 5.1.1 that Il = α X1∗ ∧ X2∗ ∧ X3∗ , α ∈ C. Replacing X1 by α1 X1
        and Z1 by α Z1 , we can assume that α = 1. Using Proposition 4.5.1 and
        Lemma 5.3.1, ∂ = − 12 adP (I) = − ∑3i=1 ιXi (X1∗ ∧ X2∗ ∧ X3∗ ) ∧ ιZi , so by 2.2
        and 2.1, [X ,Y ] = ∑3i=1 ιXi (X1∗ ∧ X2∗ ∧ X3∗ )(X ,Y ) Zi , ∀ X , Y ∈ l and the com-
        mutation rules follow.
    (2) Assuming dim(l) = 5, one has dim(Z(l)) = 2. Using [4], there is a to-
        tally isotropic subspace l′ and a one-dimensional subspace l′′ such that l =
        Z(l) ⊕ l′ ⊕ l′′ and B(Z(l) ⊕ l′ , l′′ ) = {0}.Then one can find a basis {Z1 , Z2 }
        of Z(l), a basis {X1 , X2 } of l and a basis {T } of l′′ such that: B(Zi , X j ) = δi j ,
        ∀ i, j and B(T, T ) = 1. Therefore
                    ∗
              Z(l)⊥ = span{X1∗ , X2∗ , T ∗ } = span{φ (Z1 ), φ (Z2 ), φ (T )}.
            So Il = α X1∗ ∧ X2∗ ∧ T ∗ , α ∈ C. Replacing X1 by α1 X1 and Z1 by α Z1 , we
        can assume that α = 1. By Proposition 4.5.1 and Lemma 5.3.1, one obtains
        ∂ = − 21 adP (I) = − ∑2i=1 ιXi (X1∗ ∧ X2∗ ∧ T ∗ ) ∧ ιZi −ιT (X1∗ ∧ X2∗ ∧ T ∗ ) ∧ ιT , so
        by 2.2 and 2.1, [X ,Y ] = ∑2i=1 ιXi (X1∗ ∧ X2∗ ∧ T ∗ )(X ,Y ) Zi + ιT (X1∗ ∧ X2∗ ∧
        T ∗ ) T , ∀ X , Y ∈ l and the commutation rules follow.
    (3) Assuming dim(l) = 4, one has dim(Z(l)) = 1. Using [4], there is a totally
        isotropic 2-dimensional subspace i such that Z(l) ⊂ i. Since Z(l)⊥ = [l, l],
        one has i ⊂ [l, l]. Using [4] once more, there exists a totally isotropic i′ such
        that l = i ⊕ i′ . Let us write i = span{Z, P}, i′ = span{X , Q} with Z(l) = C Z
        and B(Z, X ) = B(P, Q) = 1, B(Z, Q) = B(X , P) = 0. Therefore
                        ∗
               Z(l)⊥ = span{P∗ , Q∗ , X ∗ } = span{φ (Q), φ (P), φ (Z)}.
             So Il = α P∗ ∧ Q∗ ∧ X ∗ , α ∈ C. Replacing P by α1 P and Q by α Q, we
         can assume that α = 1. Using Proposition 4.5.1, Lemma 5.3.1, 2.2 and 2.1
         as above, one finds [A, B] = [ιP (P∗ ∧ Q∗ ∧ X ∗ ) Q + ιQ (P∗ ∧ Q∗ ∧ X ∗ ) P +
         ιX (P∗ ∧ Q∗ ∧ X ∗) Z](A, B), ∀ A, B ∈ l and the commutation rules follow.
   As a final remark, the brackets in (1), (2) and (3) do satisfy Jacobi identity thanks
to Remark 5.1.6.                                                                      

6.1. First we need some notations: g will be a n-dimensional quadratic vector
                                   V             V
space with bilinear form B and + g = ∑k≥1 k g, which is an associative algebra
without unit. If g is a quadratic Lie algebra, we denote by F0 its bracket     V
                                                                                    (i.e.
F0 (X ,Y ) = [X ,Y ], X , Y ∈ g), by ∂ = D(F0 ) (see 2.2) the differential of g, by
H ∗ (g) the corresponding cohomology, and by H+∗ (g) the restricted cohomology,
i.e. H+∗ (g) = ∑k≥1 H k (g) which is an algebra without unit (for the induced wedge
product).                                               V

                                                                                   Pois-
son bracket with grading g[2]. Denote by Q g the quotient gla Q g = g/C,
                                            V
and by [., .]Q its bracket. The map adP : g → D(g) is a gla homomorphism,          V
                                                                                     we
define the gla H (g) of Hamiltonian derivations to be theV
                                                            image  H  (g) =  ad P (  g),
as in 4.3. There is an obvious gla isomorphism from Q g onto H (g), and since
V                                   V
          e
   Q g ≃ H(n) (see 4.3), the gla
                                                       e
                                      Q g, H (g) and H(n) are isomorphic. More-
over, if g is a quadratic Lie algebra, since ∂ is Hamiltonian (see Proposition 4.5.1),
the super Poisson bracket induces a gla structure on H ∗ (g) and also on HQ∗ (g) =
H ∗ (g)/C.

6.2.     Given C ∈ Mak (g) (see 1.2), we define Cb by:
            if k = 0, C ∈ g, C(Yb ) := B(C,Y ), ∀ Y ∈ g,
                      b 1 , . . . ,Yk+1 ) := B(C(Y1 , . . . ,Yk ),Yk+1 ), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Yk+1 ∈ g.
            if k > 0, C(Y
Definition 6.2.1. C is a cyclic cochain if
             b 1 , . . . ,Yk+1 ) = (−1)kC(Y
             C(Y                        b k+1 ,Y1 , . . . ,Yk ), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Yk+1 ∈ g.

     We denote by Cc (g) the space of cyclic cochains.
Proposition 6.2.2.
                                                    V
       (1) C is a cyclic cochain if and only if Cb ∈ + g. The map Θ from Cc (g) into
           V
            + g defined by Θ(C) = C, is one to one.

       (2) When g is finite dimensional, the map Θ : Cc (g) → + g is an isomorphism.
       (3) Cc (g) is a subalgebra of the gla Ma (g)
Proof.
   (1) Let τ be the cycle τ = (1 2 . . . k + 1) ∈ Sk+1 . Given σ ∈ Sk+1 , let ℓ =
       σ −1 (k + 1), then σ ′ = σ ◦ τ ℓ ∈ Sk . If C is cyclic, one has τ −1 .Cb = ε (τ ) C.
                                                                                         b
                                                                 V
       So σ .C = (σ ◦ τ ).C = ε (σ )C and therefore C ∈ + g. Since B is non
                b         ′   −ℓ b        b                  b
       degenerate, Θ is clearly one to one.
                       V
   (2) Given Ω ∈ k+1 g, define D ∈ Mak (g) by Ω(Y1 , . . . ,Yk ,Y ) = B(D(Y1 , . . . ,Yk ),Y ),
       ∀Y1 , . . . ,Yk ,Y ∈ g. Then Ω = D.

        (3) Let F ∈ Map (g), and G ∈ Maq (g), from (1) we have to prove that:
        B([F, G]a (Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q−1 ),Yp+q ) = B([F, G]a (Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q−2 ,Yp+q ),Yp+q−1 ),
                for all Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q ∈ g. Using the formulas of 1.1, we can write the
             left hand side as a sum of four terms, B([F, G]a (Y1 , . . . ,Yp+q−1 ),Yp+q ) =
             α + β + γ + δ where:
α = (−1)(p−1)(q−1)                    ∑       (. . . )        and        β = (−1)(p−1)(q−1)                  ∑        (. . . )

                               σ (p+q−1)=p+q                                                          σ (q)=p+q−1

                               σ ∈S p,q−1                                         σ ∈S p,q−1

               In α , we can commute, up to a sign, Yp+q−1 and Yp+q . In δ , we com-
             mute, up to a sign, F(Yσ (1) , . . . ,Yσ (p−1) ,Yp+q−1 ) and Yp+q to obtain:

                Now commute, up to a sign, G(Yp+q ,Yσ (p+1) , . . . ,Yσ (p+q−1) ) and Yp+q−1
             to obtain:

                Let Zi = Yi , i = 1, . . . , p + q − 2 and Z p+q−1 = Yp+q , then:

             1 = σ (p), τ (q + 1) = σ (1), . . . , τ (q + p − 1) = σ (p − 1). Comparing the

               Using similar arguments to compute β + γ , one obtains the required
            identity.

Remark 6.2.3. When g is finite dimensional, there is a direct proof of (6.2.2)(3)
(avoiding computations) that we shall give in the proof of Proposition 6.4.1, in
Remark 6.4.2.
6.3.   We assume now that g is a quadratic Lie algebra.
Proposition 6.3.1. (Cc (g), d) is a subcomplex of the adjoint cohomology complex
(Ma (g), d) of g.
Proof. It is enough to check that d(Cc (g)) ⊂ Cc (g), but this is obvious from Propo-
sition 6.2.2(3) because d = ad(F0 ) and F0 ∈ Cc (g) since g is quadratic.          
Definition 6.3.2. The cohomology of the complex (Cc (g), d) is called the cyclic
cohomology of g, and denoted by Hc∗ (g).
Remark 6.3.3. Since d = ad(F0 ), the Gerstenhaber bracket induces a gla structure
on Hc∗ (g).
                                                    V
Proposition 6.3.4. The map Θ : Cc (g) → + g is a homomorphism of complexes.
Moreover, Θ induces a map Θ∗ : Hc∗ (g) → H+∗ (g), which is an isomorphism when
g is finite dimensional.
Proof. By an easy computation, one has Θ ◦ d = ∂ ◦ Θ and the two first claims
follow. For the third claim, use Proposition 6.2.2.                         
Example 6.3.5. Assume that g is the Lie algebra associated to an associative al-
gebra with a trace such that the bilinear form Tr(XY ) := XY , ∀X , Y ∈ g is non
degenerate (e.g. g is the Lie algebra of finite rank operators on a given vector
space, see Examples 3.3.9 and 3.3.10). Consider the standard polynomials Ak , for
k ≥ 0 if g had a unit, or for k > 0, if g has no unit. Since [A2 , A2k ]a = 0 by Propo-
sition 3.2.1, each A2k is a cocycle, then by Proposition 3.3.8, it is a cyclic cocycle,
and one has Θ(A2k ) = 2k+1 1
                               Tr(A2k+1 ).
6.4. We assume now that g is a n-dimensional quadratic vector space. Using the
super Poisson bracket, we shall now go further into the structure of Cc (g). We need
to renormalize
      V
               the map Θ, defining Φ := − 21 Θ. We denote by µ theVcanonical map
               V
from g onto Q g, and by Ψ the map Ψ = µ ◦ Φ from Cc (g) into Q g.
Proposition 6.4.1.
   (1) If C ∈ Cc (g), one has D(C) = adP (Φ(C)).
   (2) The restriction map H = D|Cc (g) is a gla isomorphism from Cc (g)[1] onto
       H (g).

                                                                 V
    (3) Ψ is a gla isomorphism from Cc (g)[1] onto               Q g[2].

   by a formula given in 2.3, and this proves (1). From (1), we deduce that D maps
Cc (g) into H (g).
   To prove (2), we remark that adP ◦ Φ is onto by Proposition 6.2.2 (2), so H is
onto, one to one and a gla homomorphism by Proposition 2.1.1 and this proves (2).

Remark 6.4.2. Let us give a direct proof of 6.2.2 (2): given C, C′ ∈ Cc (g), from
the preceding
         V
               results, we can assume that C = F(adP (Ω)), C′ = F(adP (Ω′ )), with
Ω, Ω′ ∈ + g. Then:
                                                                                 
[C,C′ ]a = [F(adP (Ω)), F(adP (Ω′ ))]a = F [adP (Ω), adP (Ω′ )] = F adP ({Ω, Ω′ })  
                                                                 V
  To prove (3), we use the gla isomorphism ν : Q g → H (g) defined from
      V                                             V
adP : g → H (g), so one has ν (µ (Ω)) = adP (Ω), Ω ∈ g, and then ν (Ψ(C)) =
adP (Φ(C)) = H(C), ∀ C ∈ Cc (g), so Ψ = ν −1 ◦ H.                         
                                                               e
Corollary 6.4.3. The gla Cc (g) is isomorphic to H (g), and to H(n).
                                                         V
   Using Φ, we can pull back the ∧-product of            +g      on Cc (g) defining:

Definition 6.4.4.
                                              
                    C ∧C′ := Φ−1 Φ(C) ∧ Φ(C′ ) , ∀ C,C′ ∈ Cc (g).

  Hence Cc (g) becomes an associative algebra (without unit),

   In the first term of the right hand side, for each σ define τ by τ (i) = σ (i),

τ by τ (1) = σ (k′ + 2), τ (k) = σ (k + k′ + 1), τ (k + 1) = k + k′ + 2, τ (k + 2) = σ (1),

  One has to be careful that ad(C) (C ∈ Cc (g)) is generally not a derivation of the
∧-product of Cc (g), so the following result is of interest:
                                                              ′
Proposition 6.4.6. If C ∈ Cck (g), C′ ∈ Cck (g), C′′ ∈ Cc (g), with k ≥ 1, then:
                                                                             ′
          ad(C)(C′ ∧C′′ ) = ad(C)(C′ ) ∧C′′ + (−1)(k+1)(k +1)C′ ∧ ad(C)(C′′ ).
   This means that when C ∈ Cck (g)[1], then ad(C) is a derivation of degree k of
the graded algebra Cc (g)[−1] with the ∧-product.
Proof. One has
                                                                        

                           V           V
Since adP (Φ(C)) ( g) ⊂ + g, it follows that Φ(ad(C)(C′ )) = adP (Φ(C)) (Φ(C′ )),
andVthe result is proved using the fact that adP (Φ(C)) is a derivation of degree k − 1
of g, and the definition of the ∧-product of Cc (g).                                 
   Using the Proposition above, and d = ad(F0 ) with F0 ∈ Cc2 (g), it results that
the ∧-product of Cc (g) induces a ∧-product on Hc∗ (g) and φ ∗ = − 12 θ ∗ is clearly
an isomorphism of graded algebras from Hc∗ (g) onto H+∗ (g). From the definition
of the gla bracket on Hc∗ (g), denoting by µ ∗ the canonical map from H ∗ (g) onto

HQ∗ (g) = H ∗ (g)/C, the map Ψ∗ = µ ∗ ◦ Φ∗ is a gla isomorphism from Hc∗ (g) onto
HQ∗ (g). We summarize in:
Proposition 6.4.7. As a graded associative algebra, Hc∗ (g) is isomorphic to H+∗ (g)
and as a gla , Hc∗ (g) is isomorphic to HQ∗ (g).
Example 6.4.8. Let g = gl(n). Then H+∗ (g) = Ext+ [a1 , a3 , . . . , a2n−1 ], where ak =
Tr(Ak ), k ≥ 0 (e.g. [10]). One has Θ(A2k ) = 2k+1   1
                                                         Tr(A2k+1 ) (Example 6.3.5), so
by Proposition 6.4.7, Hc∗ (g) = Ext+ [A0 , A2 , . . . , A2n−2 ]. The gla bracket will be
computed in Example 8.3.1.
Remark 6.4.9. When g is not finite dimensional, the map Θ∗ of Proposition 6.3.4
is no longer an isomorphism, as shown with the following example: let V be an
infinite dimensional vector space, and g be the quadratic Lie algebra of finite rank
operators of V , as defined in Example 3.3.10. Recall that the invariant bilinear form
is B(X ,Y ) = Tr(XY ), X , Y ∈ g. Notice that B(X ,Y ) is well defined when X ∈ g and
Y ∈ End(V ). Moreover, the formula B([X ,Y ], Z) = −B(Y, [X , Z]) is valid if at least
one argument is in g. By Remark 3.3.12, Hc0 (g) = Z(g) = {0} and H 1 (g) = C Tr,
so:
Proposition 6.4.10. The map Θ∗ : Hc0 (g) → H 1 (g) is not onto.
  Moreover,
Proposition 6.4.11. The map Θ∗ : Hc1 (g) → H 2 (g) is not one to one.
Proof. Fix U ∈ End(V ) such that U ∈  / g ⊕ C IdV and consider the skew symmetric
derivation D of g defined by D = ad(U )|g . The derivation D is a cyclic cocycle but
D = ad(Y ) with Y ∈ g cannot be true because if U ′ ∈ End(V ) commutes with g,
then U ′ must be a multiple of IdV . So D is not a cyclic coboundary. On the other
       b ,Y ) = B(D(X ),Y ) = ∂ ω (X ,Y ) where ω ∈ V1 g is defined by ω (X ) =
hand, D(X
−B(U, X ), X ∈ g. Hence D b is a coboundary, and if we denote by D the class of D
in Hc (g), we get Θ (D) = 0, and D 6= 0.

7.1. Let g be a n-dimensional quadraticVLie algebra with bilinear form B. We
recall the natural g-modules structures on g and Ma (g) defined by:
                                                                                                   ^
θX (Ω)(Y1 , . . . ,Yp ) = − ∑ Ω(Y1 , . . . , [X ,Yi ], . . . ,Yp ), ∀ X ,Y1 , . . . ,Yp ∈ g, Ω ∈       p

                                                                                    ^

  Using the notation in 6.4, it is easy to check that
                                   Φ ◦ LX = θX ◦ Φ, ∀ X ∈ g.
  So one has:
Proposition 7.1.1. Cc (g) is a g-submodule of the g-module MaV(g) and the iso-
morphism Φ (of 6.4) is a g-module isomorphism from Cc (g) onto + g.

   It is well known
                V g
                    that any element of ( g)g is a cocycle, and if g is reductive,
        ⋆
that H (g) = ( g) [16]. Using Propositions 6.3.4, 6.4.7 and 7.1.1, we deduce:
Proposition 7.1.2. Any invariant cyclic cochain is a cocycle. If g is reductive, any
cyclic cohomology class contains one, and only one invariant cyclic cocycle (for
instance, the only invariant cyclic coboundary is 0).
   Hence, when g is reductive, we can identify Hc∗ (g) and Cc (g)g . This identi-
fication is valid

product of ( + g)g ≃ H+⋆ (g)) and for the corresponding graded Lie bracket induced

by the Gerstenhaber bracket (actually isomorphic to H (g)g and Q g ).
7.2. In the remaining of this Section, we assume that g is a semisimple Lie algebra
with invariant bilinear form B (not necessarily the Killing form).
                                      V
Proposition 7.2.1. If I and I ′ ∈ ( g)g , then {I, I ′ } = 0.
     As a consequence of this Proposition and of Proposition 6.4.7, one has:
Corollary 7.2.2. The Gerstenhaber bracket induces the null bracket on Hc∗ (g) ≃
Cc (g)g .
   To prove Proposition 7.2.1, we need several lemmas: first, let h be a Lie algebra
           V p+1 h                        V
and I ∈          h . Define a map Ω : h → p h by Ω(X ) = ιX (I), ∀ X ∈ h. Then
since I is invariant, one has:
                                                                          Vp
Lemma 7.2.3. Ω is a morphism of h-modules from (h, ad) into (                  h, θ ).
Proof. For all X , Y and Z ∈ g, we have:
       θX (Ω(Y )) = θX (ιY (I)) = [θX , ιY ](I) + ιY (θX (I)) = ι[X,Y ] (I) = Ω([X ,Y ]).
                                                                                            
     As a second argument for the proof of Proposition 7.2.1:
Lemma 7.2.4. Assuming that h is a perfect Lie algebra (i.e. h = [h, h]), there
                      V
exists a map α : h → p−1 h such that Ω = ∂ ◦ α (∂ is the differential of the trivial
cohomology of h). Moreover, if h is semisimple, there exist an h-homomorphism α
such that Ω = ∂ ◦ α .
Proof. If X ∈ h, we can find Zi , Ti ∈ h such that X = ∑i [Zi , Ti ]. Then, Ω(X ) =
∑i θZi (Ω(Ti )) by Lemma 7.2.3. But ∂ (Ω(Ti )) = ∂ (ιTi (I)) = θTi (I) − ιTi (∂ (I)) = 0
since I is an invariant. But θZi maps Z p (h) into B p (h), so Ω(X ) ∈ B p (h). To
                                                 V
construct α , fix a section σ of the map ∂ : p−1 h → B p (h), i.e. σ : B p (h) →
V p−1
       h such that ∂ ◦ σ = IdB p (h) and then set α = σ ◦ Ω. When g is semisimple,
one can fix a section σ which is a g-homomorphism.                                    
Proof. (of Proposition 7.2.1)
   Fix an orthonormal basis {X1 , . . . , Xn } of g with respect to B. Given I, I ′ ∈
 V g
( g) , let Ωr = ιXr (I), Ω′r = ιXr (I ′ ), α , α ′ the g-homomorphisms given by Lemma
7.2.4 and finally αr = α (Xr ), αr′ = α ′ (Xr ) so that Ωr = ∂ αr and Ω′r = ∂ αr′ . With

these notations, in order to finish the proof, we need to show that ∑r Ωr ∧ Ω′r = 0.
But:

Remark 7.2.5. Proposition 7.2.1 can be directly deduced from a deepVresult of
Kostant [14] about the structure of Cliff(g   ∗ )g seen as a deformation of ( g)g : by
                                          V g
the Hopf-Koszul-Samelson theorem, ( g) is an exterior algebra Ext[a1 , . . . , ar ]
with rank(g) = r and a1 , . . . , ar primitive (odd) invariants. Kostant shows that
Cliff(g ∗ )g is a Clifford algebra constructed on a , . . . , a . Since the deformation

from g to Cliff(g∗ ) has leading term the Poisson bracket, it results that {ai , a j } =
0, ∀ i, j, and then Proposition 7.2.1 follows.

                                                     ′
     {Ω, Ω′ ∧ a1 } = 0, ∀ Ω, Ω′ ∈ Extw [a3 , . . . , a2n−1 ],
                                                ′
     {Ω ∧ a1 , Ω′ ∧ a1 } = 2n(−1)w Ω ∧ Ω′ ,
                                                                                           ′
                                               ∀ Ω ∈ Ext[a3 , . . . , a2n−1 ], Ω′ ∈ Extw [a3 , . . . , a2n−1 ].
     (3) Use the isomorphism Φ∗ of Proposition 6.4.7 to find Hc∗ (s) = Cc (s)s and
         Hc∗ (g) = Cc (g)g . One has [A2 , A2k ] = 0 by Proposition 3.2.1, so A2k is a
         cocycle, obviously g-invariant. By Proposition 3.3.8, it is a cyclic cocycle,
         and Φ(A2k ) = − 2(2k+1)
                              1
                                  a2k+1 . It results that
         Hc∗ (s) = Ext+ [A2 , A4 , . . . , A2n−2 ] and Hc∗ (g) = Ext+ [A0 , A2 , . . . , A2n−2 ].
     (4) Now we compute the Gerstenhaber bracket. For Hc∗ (s), by Corollary 7.2.2,
         the Gerstenhaber bracket vanishes. For Hc∗ (g), we use the isomorphism
         Ψ∗ (see Proposition 6.4.7) combined with 7.2.6 (3) and the commutation
32                           GEORGES PINCZON, ROSANE USHIROBIRA

          rules in H ∗ (g) computed in 7.2.6 (2) from which the commutation rules in
          HQ∗ (g) = H ∗ (g)/C are deduced. Finally the result is the following:
           [F, F ′ ]a = 0, ∀ F, F ′ ∈ Ext+ [A2 , . . . , A2n−2 ],
           [A0 , F]a = 0, ∀ F ∈ Ext+ [A0 , A2 , . . . , A2n−2 ],
           [F, F ′ ∧ A0 ]a = 0, ∀ F, F ′ ∈ Ext+ [A2 , A4 , . . . , A2n−2 ],
                                n        ′                     ′
           [A0 , F ′ ∧ A0 ]a = (−1) f F ′ , ∀ F ′ ∈ Ext+f [A2 , A4 , . . . , A2n−2 ],
                                2
                                     n         ′
                        ′
           [F ∧ A0 , F ∧ A0 ]a = (−1) f F ∧ F ′ ,
                                     2
                                                                       ′
                     ∀ F ∈ Ext+ [A2 , A4 , . . . , A2n−2 ], F ′ ∈ Ext+f [A2 , A4 , . . . , A2n−2 ],
                                                                                 ′
          Remark that for the last result, one uses: F ′ ∈ Ext+f [A2 , A4 , . . . , A2n−2 ] ∩

8.1. Let g be a finite dimensional quadratic vector space with bilinear form B.
Given D ∈ D 2k−1 , k ≥ 1 denote by F = FD the associated (even) structure on g
(see Sections 1 and 2), that we also denote by a bracket notation:
                       [Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ] = F(Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ∈ g.
Definition 8.1.1. The bilinear form B is F-invariant (or F is a quadratic structure
with bilinear form B) if B([Y1 , . . . ,Y2k−1 ,Y ], Z) = −B(Y, [Y1 , . . . ,Y2k−1 , Z]), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,
Y2k−1 , Y , Z ∈ g.
     We introduce the linear maps adY1 ,...,Y2k−1 : g → g by:
                adY1 ,...,Y2k−1 (Y ) = [Y1 , . . . ,Y2k−1 ,Y ], ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Y2k−1 ,Y ∈ g.
     It is obvious that
Proposition 8.1.2. The bilinear form B is F-invariant if and only if adY1 ,...,Y2k−1 ∈
o(B), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Y2k−1 ∈ g.
     The next Proposition results directly from Propositions 6.2.2 and 6.4.1.
Proposition 8.1.3.
   (1) F is quadratic if and only if it is a cyclic cochain.
                                                        V
   (2) F is quadratic if and only if there exists I ∈ 2k+1 g such that D = − 12 adP (I)
       and in that case, one has I(Y1 , . . . ,Y2k+1 ) = B([Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ],Y2k+1 ), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,
       Y2k+1 ∈ g.
8.2. Keeping the notations of Proposition 8.1.3, a quadratic F will define a 2k-Lie
algebra structure on g (namely a quadratic 2k-Lie algebra) if and only if:
(VII)                [F, F]a = 0        or      [D, D] = 0        or      {I, I} = 0.
   Examples of quadratic 2k-Lie algebras can be directly deduced from Proposition
7.2.1: let us assume in the remaining of 8.2, that g is a semisimple Lie algebra with
bilinear form B (not necessarily the Killing form). Then one has:
                        NEW APPLICATIONS OF GRADED LIE ALGEBRAS                                      33

Proposition 8.2.1. Any invariant even cyclic cochain in Ma (g) defines a quadratic
2k-Lie algebra on g.
   These examples V
                    were introduced for the first time in [3], in the case of primi-
tive elements in ( g)g (we shall come back to the construction in [3] later in this
Section).
   Let F be an invariant even cyclic cochain, denote by:
                      [Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ] = F(Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ∈ g
   the associated quadratic 2k-bracket on g. Let us introduce, as in 8.1:
            I([Y1 , . . . ,Y2k+1 ) = B([Y1 , . . . ,Y2k ],Y2k+1 ), ∀ Y1 , . . . ,Y2k+1 ∈ g,
                                                                 V
  and the associated derivation D = − 12 adVP (I) of                 g. Since [D, D] = 2D2 = 0, we
can define the associated cohomology on g by
                                      H ⋆ (F) = Z(D)/B(D)
where Z(D) = ker(D) and B(D) = Im(D).
  The following Lemma has to be compared with Formula III of 2.1:
Proposition 8.2.2. Let {X1 , . . . , Xn } be an orthonormal basis of g with respect to
                                     V
B. Then there exist β1 , . . . , βn ∈ 2k−1 g such that:
                                          1
                                     D = ∑ βr ∧ θXr .
                                          2 r
Proof. Let {ω1 , . . . , ωn } be the dual basis of {X1 , . . . , Xn }. One has θXr (ωs )(Y ) =
B([Xr , Xs ],Y ) for all Y ∈ g. So θXr (ωs ) = −θXs (ωr ) for all r, s. Define Ω(X ) =
                                                                                     V
ιX (I), X ∈ g. By Lemma 7.2.4, there exists a g-homomorphism α : g → 2k−1 g
such that Ω = ∂ ◦ α . Define αr = α (Xr ), then θXr (αs ) = α ([Xr , Xs ]), so one has
θXr (αs ) = −θXs (αr ). Define Ωr = Ω(Xr ) = ∂ αr , the one has:
                                     1
                              D = − adP (I) = − ∑ Ωr ∧ ιXr .
                                     2              r

So D(ωr ) = −∂ αr . Then using ∂ = 12 ∑s ωs ∧ θXs ([16]), one has:
                                                                           
             1                       1
    ∂ αr = − ∑ ωs ∧ θXr (αs ) = −        θXr (∑ ωs ∧ αs ) − ∑ θXr (ωs ) ∧ αs .
             2 s                     2        s             s
But ∑s ωs ∧ αs is g-invariant, so :
              1                     1                1
       ∂ αr = ∑ θXr (ωs ) ∧ αs = − ∑ αs ∧ θXr (ωs ) = ∑ αs ∧ θXs (ωr ).
              2 s                   2 s              2 s
                                                                       V
   Therefore, since D and ∑s αs ∧ θXs are derivations of                   g, one has D = − 21 ∑s αs ∧
θXs , and setting βs = −αs , the Proposition is proved.                                             
   From Proposition 8.2.2, we deduce:
                                      V
Proposition 8.2.3. One has ( g)g ⊂ Z(D).
                                  V                                                              V
  From the fact that I ∈ ( g)g , D is a g-homomorphism of the g-module                               g,
which is semisimple. By standard arguments ([16]), one deduces:
34                          GEORGES PINCZON, ROSANE USHIROBIRA

                                    V
Proposition 8.2.4. One has ( g)g ⊂ H ⋆ (F).
                                                                                               V
   When F is the Lie algebra structure of g, it is well known that H ⋆ (F) = ( g)g
([16]).
8.3. Let us now place the constructions in [3] in our context. We assume that g
is a semisimple Lie algebra of rank r and fix a non degenerate symmetric bilinear
form B (not necessarily Killing) on g. Let S(g) = Sym(g∗ ). Using Chevalley’s the-
orem, there exist homogeneous invariantsVQ1 , . . . , Qr with qi = deg(Qi ) such that
S(g)g = C[Q1 , . . . , Qr ]. Let t : S(g)g → ( g)g be the Cartan-Chevalley transgres-
sion operator
      V
               ([5], [6]). By the Hopf-Koszul-Samelson theorem ([5], [6], [14]), one
has ( g)g = Ext[t(Q1 ), . . . ,t(Qr )]Vand deg(t(Qi )) = 2qi − 1. By (VII) and Proposi-
tion 7.2.1, any odd element I in ( g)g defines a quadratic 2k-Lie algebra structure
on g (and corresponding generalized Poisson bracket on g∗ ). As a particular case,
this works for t(Qi ), i = 1, . . . , r which define a (2qi − 2)-Lie algebra structure on g
and a GPB on g∗ , and these are exactly the examples given in [3], though in these
papers there are no citations, neither to Chevalley [6], nor to Cartan [5]. Let us
insist that not only primitive invariants (as sometimes claimed in [3]), but actually
all odd invariants do define 2k-Lie algebra structures on g (Propositions 8.1.3 and
8.2.1).
Example 8.3.1. Using the notation and the results of Example 7.2.6, let us consider
the case of g = gl(n), with bilinear form B(X ,Y ) = Tr(XY ), ∀X ,Y ∈ g. Consider
C = F + F ′ ∧ A0 with F, F ′ ∈ Ext+ [A2 , A4 , . . . , A2n−2 ]. In order to have C an
even element of Ma (g), we have to assume that F ∈ Extodd       + [A2 , A4 , . . . , A2n−2 ] and
F ′ ∈ Exteven
         +    [A 2 , . . . , A2n−2 ] (see the last remark in Example 7.2.6 (4)). Moreover,
                                           ′
we have to assume that F and F ∧ A0 have the same degree in Ma (g), say 2k.
Then, from commutation rules in 7.2.6 (4), C defines a 2k-Lie algebra structure
on g if and only if F ′ ∧ F ′ = 0. This last condition is obviously satisfied if F ′ is
decomposable. For instance, if n ≥ 3, α A8 + β A0 ∧ A2 ∧ A4 , α , β ∈ C, defines a
8-Lie algebra structure on g; if n ≥ 4, α A14 + β A0 ∧ A4 ∧ A8 , α , β ∈ C, defines a
14-Lie algebra structure on g.
