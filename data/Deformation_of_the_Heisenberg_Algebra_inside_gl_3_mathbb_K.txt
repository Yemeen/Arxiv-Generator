                                                   Deformations of the Heisenberg algebra
                                                              inside gl(3, K)
                                                                             Yaël Frégier


                                                                                Abstract
                                                      We study non-trivial deformations of the natural imbedding of the
                                                  Lie algebra h1 of lower triangular matrices (the Heisenberg Lie algebra)
                                                  into gl(3, K), where K = R or C. Our first result is the calculation
                                                  of the first cohomology space H 1 (h1 ; gl(3, K)). We prove that there
                                                  are no obstructions for integrability of infinitesimal deformation and,
                                                  furthermore, give an explicit formula for the most general deformation.


                                             1    Introduction
                                             The Heisenberg algebra h1 is the Lie algebra of three by three lower triangular
                                             matrices. Our aim is to deform the standard imbedding

                                                                            ρ : h1 ֒→ gl(3, K),                              (1.1)

                                             where K = R or C. The theory of deformations of Lie stuctures (algebras and
                                             morphisms) is now a classical subject (see e.g. [G], [N-R3], [R]). However, a
                                             new concept of miniversal deformation of Lie algebras has been introduced
                                             in [Fi-Fu1]. It is of course inspired by the notion of universal unfolding in
                                             singularity theory. While Fialowski and Fuchs developed this notion for Lie
                                             algebras, the case of Lie algebra homomorphisms has been recently considered
                                             (see [A-A-O-L] and also [O-R1, O-R2]).
                                                 In this paper we will completely describe the miniversal deformation of
                                             the imbedding (1.1).




                                                                                     1
2     Deformations of homomorphisms
Let ρ : h → g be a homomorphism of Lie algebras. A deformation of ρ is an
expression of the type
                                     ∞
                                     X
                         ρ(t) = ρ0 +     ρm (t)                     (2.1)
                                            m=1

where t = (t1 , . . . , tr ) are the parameters of the deformation and each term
ρm (t) is a linear map from h to g homogeneous in t of degree m. Note that
t1 , . . . , tr can be considered as real (or complex) parameters, or as generators
of a commutative associative algebra (cf. [Fi-Fu1]), upon the context.
      The deformation must be a Lie homomorphism for every value of the
parameter t, i.e. satisfy:

                       ρ(t)([X, Y ]) = [ρ(t)(X), ρ(t)(Y )]                   (2.2)

for every X, Y ∈ h.
    If the sum (2.1) is finite, the deformation is said to be polynomial. In our
case, one can restrict to polynomial deformations since our construction will
involve only a finite number of non vanishing terms (cf. main results below).

2.1    Equivalent deformations and the first cohomology
The standard Chevalley-Eilenberg differential is given, in the case of a linear
map m from h to g, by the following formula:

          δ 1 m(X, Y ) = m([X, Y ]) − [ρ(X), m(Y )] + [ρ(Y ), m(X)].         (2.3)

Let us expand formula (2.2) as a series in t, the first order term is of the
form                                  r
                                     X
                            ρ1 (t) =    ti ρi1 .                       (2.4)
                                         i=1

¿From (2.2) one obtains    δρi1
                            = 0, that is, each map ρi1 is a one-cocycle.
   Two deformations ρ(t) and ρ′ (t) are equivalent if there exists an inner
automorphism I(t) : g ⊗ K[t1 , . . . , tr ] −→ g ⊗ K[t1 , . . . , tr ] of the form
                                                                          !
                        X                     X
            I(t) = exp         ti adAi +           ti tj adAij + . . . ,
                           1≤i≤r            1≤i,j≤r


                                        2
where Ai , Aij , . . . are some elements of g, such that the relation I(t) ◦ ρ(t) =
ρ′ (t) is satisfied.
     Moreover one can check that the first order terms ρi1 and ρ′ i1 differ by a
coboundary i.e. ρ′ i1 = ρi1 + δAi . It follows that infinitesimal deformation of
the homomorphism ρ are classified by the first cohomology space H 1 (h; g).

2.2      Cup-product and Maurer-Cartan equation
The standard cup-product (or Nijenhuis-Richardson product) of linear maps
a, b : h → g is the linear map [[a, b]] : h ⊗ h → g defined by

                     [[a, b]](X, Y ) = [a(X), b(Y )] − [a(Y ), b(X)].

    Put φ(t) = ρ(t) − ρ0 , the morphism equation (2.2) reads
                                       1
                                δφ(t) − [[φ(t), φ(t)]] = 0                                (2.5)
                                       2
(see [N-R3, R]). This equation is called the Maurer-Cartan equation (or the
deformation equation).
    Developing the Maurer-Cartan equation (2.5), one gets
                                          1 X
                             δρm (t) =           [[ρi (t), ρj (t)]]                       (2.6)
                                          2 i+j=m

for each m. The right hand side of this equation is always a 2-cocycle for
any m (cf., e.g., [Fu]). The equation admits a solution if and only if it is a
coboundary. The cohomology class of the 2-cocycle in the right hand side
of (2.6) is an obstruction for prolongation of the deformation to the order m.

2.3      Construction of the miniversal deformation
We are interested in deformations up to equivalence, hence, we will set r =
dim H 1 (h; g) and choose the basis [c1 ], . . . , [cr ] of H 1 (h; g) where c1 , . . . , cr are
non-trivial 1-cocycles on h with coefficients in g. We then put

                                           ρi1 = ci .

   The construction of the miniversal deformation goes as follows. Assume,
by induction, that we constructed the deformation (2.1) to the order m − 1.

                                               3
To construct the m-th order term, one has to solve the equation (2.6). The
right hand side of (2.6) is an element of Z 2 (h; g) ⊗ Km [t1 , . . . , tr ]; if this is a
coboundary then there exists a solution of (2.6).
    The solution of (2.6) can be chosen arbitrarily up to the equivalence and
reparametrization. Indeed, if ρm (t) and ρ′m (t) are two solutions, then their
difference is a 1-cocycle


3     The main results
We formulate here the main results of this paper, all proofs will be given in
Section 4.

3.1     The first group of cohomology.
One determines H 1 (h1 , gl(3, K)) in order to know the dimension of the pa-
rameter space and the infinitesimal generators of the deformation.

Theorem 3.1. Dim H 1 (h1 , gl(3, K))=4.

   We also give a basis of this cohomology space. Let eij ∈ gl(3, K) be the
standard basis of gl(3, K), namely (eij )kl = δik δjl . Denote B the natural
basis of h1 :
                    X = e21 ,     Y = e31 ,     Z = e32
and let X ∗ , Y ∗ , Z ∗ be the dual basis in h∗1 . The non-trivial cohomology classes
are generated by the following 1-cocycles.

                         ρ1 = X ∗ ⊗ e32
                         ρ2 = Z ∗ ⊗ e21
                                                                                    (3.1)
                         ρ3 = Z ∗ ⊗ (2e22 + e11 ) + Y ∗ ⊗ e21
                         ρ4 = X ∗ ⊗ (e11 + e22 + e33 ).

3.2     An expression for the miniversal deformation.
We will apply the algorithm described in Section 2.3 to the 1-cocycles (3.1).
The result is an explicit formula for the miniversal deformation.




                                            4
Theorem 3.2. Up to equivalence and reparametrisation, the miniversal de-
formation of ρ is given by the formula

           ρe(t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 ) = ρ + t1 ρ1 + t2 ρ2 + t3 ρ3 + t4 ρ4
                                 +t1 t2 ρ12 + t1 t3 ρ13 + t23 ρ33 + t1 t23 ρ133

where
                              ρ12 = X ∗ ⊗ e21
                              ρ13 = X ∗ ⊗ (2e22 + e11 )
                                                           .
                              ρ33 = −2Z ∗ ⊗ e23
                              ρ133 = −2X ∗ ⊗ e23 .
     Applied on a generical element this gives:
                                                                                               
                         0 0 0         bt3 + at1 t3 + at4            0                 0
ρe(t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 )  a 0 0  =  a + bt2 + at1 t2 + ct3 2bt3 + 2at1 t3 + at4 −bt23 − at1 t23 ) .
                         c b 0                 c                  b + t1              at4

Note, in comparison with [A-A-O-L], that no obstruction to the integrability
appears, and hence the parameter space is the free commutative algebra
K[t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 ]. In other words, there are no relations on the parameters of
the deformation.


4       Proofs of the main results
4.1     Proof of theorem 3.1
The proof consists in two steps. We will first calculate the space of 1-cocycles
and then determine its subspace of coboundaries.

4.1.1    Computation of Z 1 (h1 , gl(3, K))
Let us calculate explicitly the expression of the differential δ 1 defined by the
formula (2.3). We will then determine its kernel.

   Let Φ be a one cochain on h1 with coefficients in gl(3, K). Using the basis
X, Y, Z of h1 , let us write this cochain in the form:

                  (Φ11            33    11          33    11          33

    Let us comute δ 1 as a matrix. Since δ 1 Φ is a 2 cochain, it can be written
in the basis
                 X ⋆ ∧ Y ⋆ ⊗ eij ,      X ⋆ ∧ Z ⋆ ⊗ eij ,             Y ⋆ ∧ Z ⋆ ⊗ eij .
More precilely,
        3
        X                                                            
δ1Φ =           (δ 1 Φ)ij   ⋆   ⋆    1  ij   ⋆   ⋆    1  ij   ⋆

                                                                   ⋆
                                                                       ⊗ eij
        i,j=1

Applying δ 1 Φ to (X, Y ) one gets
                                                  3
                                                  X

                              δ Φ(X, Y ) =                (δ 1 Φ)ij
                                                                 X,Y eij .
                                                  i,j=1


One can then identify the first nine coefficients (δ 1 Φ)ij
                                                         X,Y , 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3 which
                               1
correspond to the matrix of δ first nine rows. Applying the same procedure
to (δ 1 Φ)ij        1  ij
          X,Z and (δ Φ)Y,Z , one finally gets a (27 × 27)-matrix, see Appendix
5.1.1. In order to determine the kernel of δ 1 , one has to find a maximal
free subfamily among the column vectors of the matrix of δ 1 . Dependance
relations among remaining vectors will then give the kernel. Details of these
computations can also be found in Appendix 5.1.1. This completes the proof
of Lemma 4.1.

is as follows.

4.1.3    Computation of H 1 (h1 , gl(3, K))
The dimension of Z 1 (h1 , gl(3, K)) is 11, the one of B 1 (h1 , gl(3, K)) is 7. Hence
the quotient space H 1 (h1 , gl(3, K)) has dimension 11 − 7 = 4. One can
check, see Appendices 5.1.2-5.1.3, that the first four elements e1 , e2 , e3 , e4
are independent modulo B 1 (h1 , gl(3, K)). Their classes form a basis of H 1 .
Theorem 3.1 is proved.

4.2     Proof of Theorem 3.2
We will show that every infinitesimal deformation is integrable. In other
words, there are no obtsructions to integrability.

4.2.1      Intergability at order 2
One needs to evaluate the cup-products [[ρi , ρj ]], 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 4 of the cocy-
cles (3.1). It turns out that the only non vanishing terms are three cobound-
aries:
   [[ρ1 , ρ2 ]] = X ∗ ∧ Z ∗ ⊗ e31 = δ 1 (X ⋆ ⊗ e21 )
   [[ρ1 , ρ3 ]] = 2X ∗ ∧ Z ∗ ⊗ e32 + X ∗ ∧ Y ∗ ⊗ e31 = δ 1 (X ⋆ ⊗ (2e22 + e11 ))
   [[ρ3 , ρ3 ]] = 2Z ∗ ∧ Y ∗ ⊗ e21 = δ 1 (−2Z ⋆ ⊗ e23 )
Let us choose
                                   ρ12 = X ⋆ ⊗ e21
                                   ρ13 = X ⋆ ⊗ (2e22 + e11 )
                                   ρ33 = −Z ⋆ ⊗ e23
and ρij = 0 otherwise. One extends the deformation to the order 2. The
equation (2.6) is satisfied to the second order.

4.2.2      Intergability at order 3
At the third order, the only non vanishing products are:
                                             1
                           [[ρ12 , ρ3 ]] =   2
                                                 X ∗ ∧ Z ∗ ⊗ (−e21 )
                                             1
                           [[ρ13 , ρ2 ]] =   2
                                                 X ∗ ∧ Z ∗ ⊗ (e21 )
                                             1
                           [[ρ13 , ρ3 ]] =   2
                                                 X ∗ ∧ Y ∗ ⊗ (e21 )
                           [[ρ33 , ρ1 ]] = −Z ∗ ∧ X ∗ ⊗ (e22 − e33 )
Hence the only r-h-s expressions that might appear in (2.6) are
         [[ρ33 , ρ1 ]] + [[ρ3 , ρ31 ]] = X ⋆ ∧ Y ⋆ ⊗ e21 + X ⋆ ∧ Z ⋆ ⊗ (e22 − e33 )
                                    = δ(−X ⋆ ⊗ e23 )
and
      [[ρ12 , ρ3 ]] + [[ρ1 , ρ23 ]] +[[ρ2 , ρ13 ]] = X ⋆ ∧ Z ⋆ ⊗ (−e21 ) + X ⋆ ∧ Z ⋆ ⊗ e21
                      | {z }
                      =0
                                             = 0.
    This shows that that the deformation can be extended to the third order
(there are no obstructions). More precisely, we set ρ331 = −X ⋆ ⊗ e23 and
ρijk = 0 if (i, j, k) 6= (3, 3, 1).

                                                   9
4.2.3   Intergability at order 4
At the fourth order, the only non vanishing cup-products appearing in (2.6)
are:

                         [[ρ133 , ρ3 ]] = X ∗ ∧ Z ∗ ⊗ e23
                         [[ρ13 , ρ33 ]] = −X ∗ ∧ Z ∗ ⊗ e23 .
Hence the only equation for which the r-h-s is not identicaly zero a-priori
is ρ1333 . However, one has

        [[ρ133 , ρ3 ]] + [[ρ13 , ρ33 ]] = −X ∗ ∧ Z ∗ ⊗ e23 + X ∗ ∧ Z ∗ ⊗ e23 = 0,

therefore no obstruction appears. Hence the deformation can be extended to
the order 4, setting ρijkl = 0 for all i, j, k, l.

4.2.4   Intergability at order 5
At the fifth order, all the cup-products are zero. Indeed, a straightforward
computation shows that all the terms of the type [[ρijk , ρlm ]] vanish. Hence
all the terms appearing in the general formula (2.6) vanish. There are no
obstructions to integrabilitiy, and one can extend the deformation to the
fifth order setting ρijklm = 0 for all i, j, k, l, m.

4.2.5   Intergability at any order
At order 6, all the cup-products constituted by one term of order one and an
other term of order five vanish since we have just set the fifth order terms to
be zero. It is just the same for the terms constituted by an element of order
four and an other one of order two since we’ve set the elements of order four
to be zero (cf 4.2.3). At last the only cup-product constituted with two non
vanishing terms of order three is [[ρ331 , ρ331 ]] wich turns out to be zero.
   The analogous arguments are valid at every order. Theorem 3.2 is proved.

These elements are in the kernel because of the preceding relations.

5.1.2   Computing δ 0
The matrix of δ 0 is given by the following set of vectors:
              δ11   =   −X ⋆ ⊗ 21 − Y ⋆ ⊗ 31,
              δ12   =   X ⋆ ⊗ (11 − 22) − Y ⋆ ⊗ 32,
              δ13   =   −X ⋆ ⊗ 23 + Y ⋆ ⊗ (11 − 33) + Z ⋆ ⊗ 12,
              δ21   =   −Z ⋆ ⊗ 31,
              δ22   =   X ⋆ ⊗ 21 − Z ⋆ ⊗ 32,
              δ23   =   Y ⋆ ⊗ 21 + Z ⋆ ⊗ (22 − 33),
              δ32   =   X ⋆ ⊗ 31,
which are independent and
                         δ31 = 0,
                         δ33 = Y ⋆ ⊗ 31 + Z ⋆ ⊗ 32,
which are linear combinations of the above ones. Indeed, δ31 = 0 and δ33 =
−δ11 + δ22 .

5.1.3   Computing the basis of H 1 (h1 , gl(3, K))
The first four elements e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 of the basis of the space of cocycles
Z 1 (h1 , gl(3, K)) are linearly independent modulo the coboundaries, since each
of them has an underlined component which does not appear in the elements
of the basis of the space of coboundaries B 1 (h1 , gl(3, K)).
