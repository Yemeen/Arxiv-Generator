                                                      Abstract. Let K be a compact connected Lie group acting unitarily on a
                                                      finite-dimensional complex vector space V . One calls this a multiplicity-free
                                                      action whenever the K-isotypic components of C[V ] are K-irreducible. We
                                                      have shown that this is the case if and only if the moment map τ : V → k∗ for
                                                      the action is finite-to-one on K-orbits. This is equivalent to a result concerning
                                                      Gelfand pairs associated with Heisenberg groups that is motivated by the Orbit
                                                      Method. Further details of this work will be published elsewhere.



                                                                                   1. Introduction
                                            1.1. Gelfand pairs. Suppose that G is a Lie group and that K is a compact sub-
                                            group of G. One says that K ⊂ G is a Gelfand pair when the algebra L1 (G//K) of
                                            integrable K-bi-invariant functions on G is commutative under convolution. This
                                            note concerns a special class of Gelfand pairs that are associated with Heisenberg
                                            groups. Let V be a finite-dimensional complex vector space with Hermitian struc-
                                            ture h·, ·i := (·, ·) + iω(·, ·), and form the associated Heisenberg group HV := V × R
                                            with product (z, t)(z ′ , t′ ) := (z +z ′, t+t′ − 12 ω(z, z ′ )). Let K be a compact connected
                                            Lie group acting on V via some unitary representation K × V → V , (k, z) 7→ kz.
                                            We obtain an action of K on HV by automorphisms k · (z, t) := (kz, t) and form the
                                            semidirect product G := K ⋉ HV . In this setting, L1 (G//K) is naturally identified
                                            with the algebra L1K (HV ) of integrable K-invariant functions on the Heisenberg
                                            group. We will say that (K, HV ) is a Gelfand pair when this algebra is commuta-
                                            tive.
                                                A fundamental result due to I. M. Gelfand asserts that K ⊂ G is a Gelfand
                                            pair if and only if each irreducible unitary representation π of G has at most a
                                            one-dimensional space of K-fixed vectors [5]. The K-spherical representations are
                                            those that have nonzero K-fixed vectors. By using the Mackey machine to describe
                                            the unitary dual of K ⋉ HV , one obtains an interesting specialization of this crite-
                                            rion to pairs of the form K ⊂ K ⋉ HV . Namely, (K, HV ) is a Gelfand pair if and
                                            only if the action of K on V is multiplicity-free [2, 3]. The latter condition means
                                            that each irreducible representation of K occurs at most once in the representation
                                            k · p(z) := p(k −1 z) of K on C[V ]. Multiplicity-free actions are of considerable inter-
                                            est in their own right, but are usually studied in the setting of reductive complex
                                            algebraic groups. One can pass to this setting by complexifying K. The irreducible

multiplicity-free actions of connected reductive complex algebraic groups were clas-
sified by V. Kac [10]. This yields a complete classification of the Gelfand pairs
(K, HV ) where K acts irreducibly on V [2].
    The literature contains various results relating multiplicities of Lie group rep-
resentations to geometric properties of coadjoint orbits. See for example [4, 6, 7,
8, 13]. These results motivate a conjecture that provides a geometric formulation
of Gelfand’s criterion for Gelfand pairs (K, HV ). Let k, g denote the Lie algebras
of K, G = K ⋉ HV , and let k∗ , g∗ be their duals. The Orbit Method (also called
“Geometric Quantization”) yields one-to-one correspondences between the unitary
       b G
duals K,    b of K, G and the integral orbits in k∗ , g∗ for the coadjoint actions of
K, G. (See [8] and [12] respectively.) Let π : g∗ → k∗ be the restriction map and
k⊥ := π −1 ({0}). If ξ ∈ g∗ and O G         ∗
                                   ξ := Ad (G)ξ is an integral orbit corresponding
to ρξ ∈ G, b then the multiplicity of the trivial representation of K in ρξ |K (i.e.
the dimension of the space of K-fixed vectors) should be related to the number of
K-orbits in the intersection k⊥ ∩ OG ξ .

Orbit Conjecture. Let K be a compact connected Lie group acting unitarily on
V . Then (K, HV ) is a Gelfand pair if and only if

(OC)               for every ξ ∈ k⊥ , OG    ⊥
                                       ξ ∩ k is a single K-orbit.

   Although this conjecture seems rather bold, it does hold in many interesting
cases and we have found no counterexamples to date. Moreover, we have recently
proved a result that is only slightly weaker than the Orbit Conjecture.

Theorem 1. Let K be a compact connected Lie group acting unitarily on V . Then
(K, HV ) is a Gelfand pair if and only if

(FOC)         for every ξ ∈ k⊥ , OG    ⊥
                                  ξ ∩ k is a finite union of K-orbits.

    A closely related result, due to V. Guillemin and S. Sternberg, can be found in
[7]. They prove that if G is compact, then K ⊂ G is a Gelfand pair if and only if
condition (FOC) holds generically. Theorem 1 does not, however, follow from the
results in [7] since in our case, G is not compact. We will outline our proof of this
theorem below. Details of this work will appear elsewhere [1].

1.2. The moment map. One can write points ξ ∈ g∗ as ξ = (α, z◦ , λ) where
α ∈ k∗ , z◦ ∈ V , λ ∈ R, and ξ(A, z, t) = α(A) + ω(z◦ , z) + λt for A ∈ k, z ∈ V , and
t ∈ R. One can verify that condition (OC) always holds for “nongeneric” orbits
of the form OG                                                          G
                  (α,z◦ ,0) . Moreover, one computes that for λ 6= 0, O (α,0,λ) ∩ k
                                                                                   ⊥
                                                                                     =
                        K
                              	                  ∗
  (0, z, λ) | τ (z) ∈ O−2λα where τ : V → k is the (unnormalized) moment map
defined by
                                    τ (z)(A) := ω(z, Az)
for z ∈ V , A ∈ k. Here (A, z) 7→ Az denotes the derived action of k on V . A
key property of τ is K-equivariance: τ (kz) = Ad∗ (k)τ (z). In particular, τ maps
K-orbits in V to Ad∗ (K)-orbits in k∗ . The above remarks lead to the following
reformulations of conditions (OC) and (FOC).
       • Condition (OC) holds if and only if τ is one-to-one on K-orbits.
       • Condition (FOC) holds if and only if τ is finite-to-one on K-orbits.
               THE MOMENT MAP FOR A MULTIPLICITY FREE ACTION                           3


We can now remove the Heisenberg group from the picture, restating Theorem 1 as
an equivalent result that provides a geometric criterion for multiplicity-free actions.

Theorem 2. The action of K on V is multiplicity-free if and only if the moment
map τ : V → k∗ is finite-to-one on K-orbits.

    The Orbit Conjecture is equivalent to the assertion that K × V → V is a
multiplicity-free action if and only if τ is one-to-one on K-orbits. In view of The-
orem 2, this conjecture would be proved if one could show that τ is necessarily
one-to-one on K-orbits whenever it is finite-to-one on K-orbits. Although we have
been unable to show this, we have proved that if τ is finite-to-one on K-orbits,
then τ is necessarily uniformly finite-to-one on K-orbits. This means that for some
constant M , τ −1 (O K                                            ∗
                     α ) contains at most M K-orbits for all α ∈ k . Thus, the finite-
ness result needed to complete the proof of the Orbit Conjecture would provide a
geometric counterpart to the following lemma, which has a folklore status in the
field.

Lemma 3. If the multiplicities of the representations of K occurring in C[V ] are
finite and bounded, then K × V → V is a multiplicity-free action.

1.3. Capelli actions. Let I[k∗ ] denote the Ad∗ (K)-invariant polynomials on k∗
and C[VR ]K denote the K-invariant polynomials on the underlying real vector space
VR for V . Since τ is K-equivariant, we obtain an associated map τ ∗ : I[k∗ ] →
C[VR ]K , τ ∗ (p)(z) := p(τ (z)). Condition (OC) is equivalent to the assertion that
τ ∗ (I[k∗ ]) separates K-orbits in V . Since K is compact, one knows that the full
algebra C[VR ]K of invariant polynomials always separates K-orbits. Thus we see
that condition (OC) certainly holds whenever τ ∗ (I[k∗ ]) = C[VR ]K . We say that
K × V → V is a Capelli action in this case. Theorem 2 shows that Capelli actions
are always multiplicity free. Moreover, these provide an interesting class of Gelfand
pairs that satisfy the Orbit Conjecture.
    In [9] R. Howe and T. Umeda consider the “abstract Capelli problem” for actions
of reductive complex algebraic groups. K × V → V is a Capelli action if and
only if the abstract Capelli problem for its complexification Kc × V → V has an
affirmative answer. This means that the derived action of the universal enveloping
algebra U(kc ) on V yields a surjective map dι : ZU(kc ) → PD(V )K . Here ZU(kc )
denotes the center of U(kc ), and PD(V )K is the algebra of K-invariant polynomial
coefficient differential operators on C[V ]. This relation between Capelli actions and
the abstract Capelli problem follows immediately from the commutative diagram
(1) below.
    The compact forms of many of Kac’s irreducible multiplicity-free actions [10]
are Capelli actions. From [9] one obtains a complete list of the irreducible Capelli
actions (up to equivalence):
     U (n)            on   Cn                 U (n)           on   S 2 (Cn ) (n ≥ 2)
     U (n)            on   Λ2 (Cn ) (n ≥ 2)   T × SO(n, R)    on   Cn (n ≥ 3)
     U (n) × U (m)    on   Cn ⊗ Cm            T × Sp(n)       on   C2n
     U (2) × Sp(n)    on   C2 ⊗ C2n           U (n) × Sp(4)   on   Cn ⊗ C8 (n ≥ 4)
     T × Spin(7)      on   C8                 T × Spin(10)    on   C16
     T × G2           on   C7

1.4. Spectrum of IndG     K (1K ). Suppose that (K, HV ) is a Gelfand pair. The K-
spherical representations of G are precisely the spectrum of irreducible unitary rep-
resentations weakly contained in the quasi-regular representation IndG   K (1K ) of G
on L2 (G/K). The Orbit Method suggests that these representations should corre-
spond to the integral coadjoint orbits in g∗ that meet k⊥ . Equivalently, one might
expect that σ ∈ K  b should occur in C[V ] if and only if the corresponding coadjoint
orbit in k∗ belongs to the image of the moment map τ : V → k∗ . It is not hard to
verify this for the standard action of the unitary group U (V ) (with respect to h·, ·i)
on V . This fact together with functoriality of the moment map and a theorem of
G. Heckman [8] concerning projections of coadjoint orbits establishes the following
result.

Theorem 4. If σ ∈ K     b occurs in C[V ], then the corresponding coadjoint orbit in k∗
is contained in τ (V ).

   Although the converse does hold for some interesting examples, it is not true
in general. τ (V ) can contain integral coadjoint orbits that do not correspond to
representations of K occurring in C[V ]. This can happen even when K × V → V is
a Capelli action. The action of U (n) on the symmetric 2-tensors S 2 (Cn ) provides
an example of this phenomenon. It is known that the representations of U (n)
appearing in the (multiplicity-free) decomposition of C[S 2 (Cn )] are parameterized
by Young’s diagrams with all rows of even length. On the other hand, we have
verified that the integral coadjoint orbits in the image of τ yield all representations
parameterized by Young’s diagrams of even size (total number of cells). Thus, the
image of τ produces infinitely many representations of U (n) that do not appear in
C[S 2 (Cn )].

                      2. Outline of proof of Theorem 2
   A key ingredient in our proof is the following commutative diagram relating τ ∗
to the action of the center of the complexified enveloping algebra of k on C[V ] by
polynomial coefficient differential operators.
                                          τ∗

                              ZU(kc ) −−−−→ PD(V )K

Here λ is the symmetrization map (up to scalars), and Γ takes elements of V ∗
                                                ∗
to multiplication operators and elements of V to differentiation operators. The
horizontal maps are algebra maps, and the vertical maps are vector space isomor-
phisms.
   Suppose that K × V → V is a multiplicity-free action. It follows that PD(V )K
is abelian [9] and hence, by a result of F. Knop [11], PD(V )K is finitely generated
as a module over dι(ZU (kc )). Although Γ is not an algebra map, we do know that
the terms of highest order in Γ(pq) and Γ(p)Γ(q) agree for any p, q ∈ C[VR ]K . An
induction argument on the total degree of operators in PD(V )K shows that C[VR ]K
is a finitely generated τ ∗ (I[k∗ ])-module.
                THE MOMENT MAP FOR A MULTIPLICITY FREE ACTION                                  5


     Let γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γℓ be algebra generators for C[VR ]K . Each γj is algebraic over
the fraction field of τ ∗ (I[k∗ ]). Suppose that γj satisfies a polynomial equation
of degree dj with coefficients ai,j ∈ τ ∗ (I[k∗ ]). If z◦ ∈ V and z ∈ τ −1 (τ (Kz◦ )),
then γj (z) is a root of the degree dj polynomial with coefficients ai,j (z◦ ). Thus,
γ1 × γ2 × · · · × γℓ : V → Cℓ assumes at most M := d1 d2 · · · dℓ distinct values on
τ −1 (τ (Kz◦ )). As the level sets of γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γℓ are the K-orbits in V , this shows
that τ is (uniformly) finite-to-one on K-orbits.
     Next suppose that τ is finite-to-one on K-orbits and choose R-valued generators
q1 , . . . , qm for τ ∗ (I[k∗ ]). For simplicity, we assume here that q1 , . . . , qm are alge-
braically independent over R. The level set of q1 × · · · × qm through z◦ ∈ V is
τ −1 (τ (Kz◦ )), which is a finite union of K-orbits.
     Let z◦ be a (“generic”) point in V where D(q1 × · · · × qm )(z◦ ) has maximal
rank. In fact, one can argue that this maximal rank is precisely m. Some open
neighborhood of z◦ is foliated by K-orbits of codimension m. The orthogonal
complement of the tangent space to Kz◦ at z◦ is a dimension m affine subspace A
of VR that meets all K-orbits through points z sufficiently close to z◦ . Let q̃j := qj |A .
q̃1 , . . . , q̃m are algebraically independent over R since a polynomial relation between
the q̃j ’s would imply (by K-invariance) a polynomial relation between the qj ’s in a
neighborhood of z◦ . Now let p be any R-valued K-invariant polynomial on VR and
consider p̃ := p|A . By dimensional considerations, p̃ is algebraic over R (q̃1 , . . . , q̃m ),
and it follows by K-invariance that p is algebraic over the fraction field of τ ∗ (I[k∗ ]).
We conclude that C[VR ]K is a finitely generated τ ∗ (I[k∗ ])-module and hence that
PD(V )K is finitely generated as a dι(ZU (kc ))-module.
     Let σ ∈ K      b and Hσ be the space of highest weight vectors for σ in C[V ]. The
proof of Proposition 7.1 in [9] shows that PD(V )K must act irreducibly on Hσ
when PD(V )K is a finitely generated dι(ZU (kc ))-module. One argues that if
{D1 , . . . , Dℓ } are generators for PD(V )K as a dι(ZU(kc ))-module and p ∈ Hσ ,
then Hσ ⊂ Span {D1 p, . . . , Dℓ p}. Thus the multiplicity of σ in C[V ] is at most ℓ
for all σ ∈ K.     b Lemma 3 now implies that K × V → V is a multiplicity-free action.
