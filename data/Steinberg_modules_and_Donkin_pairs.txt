                                             1    Summary
                                             We prove that in characteristic p > 0 a module with good filtration for a
                                             group of type E6 restricts to a module with good filtration for a group of
                                             type F4 . Thus we confirm a conjecture of Brundan for one more case. Our
                                             method relies on the canonical Frobenius splittings of Mathieu. Next we
                                             settle the remaining cases, in characteristic not 2, with a computer-aided
                                             variation on the old method of Donkin.


                                             2    Preliminaries
                                             Our base field k is algebraically closed of characteristic p. Let G be a con-
                                             nected semisimple group and H a connected semisimple subgroup. (Good
                                             filtrations with more general groups are treated in [3].) We refer to [5] and
                                             [16] for unexplained terminology and notation.
                                                  Now choose a Borel subgroup B in G and a maximal torus T in B so
                                             that, if B − is the opposite Borel subgroup, then B ∩ H and B − ∩ H are a
                                             Borel subgroups in H and T ∩ H is a maximal torus in H.
                                                  We follow the convention that the roots of B are positive. If λ ∈ X(T )
                                             is dominant, then indG                                         ∗
                                                                    B (−λ) is the dual Weyl module ∇G (λ ) with highest
                                             weight λ∗ = −w0 λ and lowest weight −λ. Its dual is the Weyl module ∆G (λ).
                                             In a good filtration of a G-module the layers are of the form ∇G (µ).

                                             Definition 2.1 We say that (G, H) is a Donkin pair if for any G-module M
                                             with good filtration, the H-module resG
                                                                                   H M has good filtration.




                                                                                  1
   Let U(U) denote the hyperalgebra of the unipotent radical U of B. We
recall the presentation of Weyl modules.

Lemma 2.2 Let λ be dominant and let v−λ∗ be a nonzero weight vector of
lowest weight −λ∗ in ∆G (λ). Then v−λ∗ generates ∆G (λ) as a U(U)-module,
                                                                            (n)
and the annihilator of v−λ∗ equals the left ideal of U(U) generated by the Xα
with α simple and n > (λ∗ , α∨ ).

Proof Note that U(U) is a graded algebra graded by height. Therefore the
left ideal in the lemma is the intersection of all ideals I of finite codimension
that contain it and that lie inside the annihilator. But by the proof of [12,
Proposition Fondamentale] such ideals I are equal to the annihilator.           ✷

    Let X be a smooth projective B-variety with canonical bundle ω. (Gen-
eralizations to other varieties will be left to the reader.) There is by [10, §2]
a natural map ǫ : H 0 (X, ω 1−p ) → k so that φ ∈ H 0 (X, ω 1−p ) determines a
Frobenius splitting if and only if ǫ(φ) = 1. Let StG be the Steinberg module
of the simply connected cover G̃ of G. For simplicity of notation we further
assume that StG is actually a G-module. Its B-socle is the highest weight
space k(p−1)ρ .
    Recall that a Frobenius splitting of X is called canonical if the cor-
responding φ is T -invariant and lies in the image of a B-module map
StG ⊗k(p−1)ρ → H 0 (X, ω 1−p ). (Compare lemma 2.2 and [16, Definition
4.3.5].) If the group G needs to be emphasized, we will speak of a G-canonical
splitting. Now suppose X is actually a G-variety.

Lemma 2.3 X has a canonical splitting if and only if there is a G-module
map ψ : StG ⊗ StG → H 0 (X, ω 1−p ) so that ǫψ 6= 0.

Proof There is, up to scalar multiple, only one possibility for a map
StG ⊗ StG → k. If ǫψ 6= 0 then the subspace of T -invariants in StG ⊗k(p−1)ρ
maps isomorphically to k. Conversely, a map from StG ⊗k(p−1)ρ to a G-
module M can be extended to StG ⊗ StG because the G-module generated
by the image of k(p−1)ρ in M ⊗ St∗G is StG .                              ✷

   We have the following fundamental result of Mathieu [8].



                                       2
Theorem 2.4 [9, 6.2] Assume X has a canonical splitting and L is a G-
linearized line bundle on X. Then H 0 (X, L) has a good filtration.


3     Pairings
Now apply this to X = G/B. Of course the ∇G (µ) are of the form H 0 (X, L),
see [5, I 5.12]. It follows that (G, H) is a Donkin pair if X has an H-canonical
splitting. We also have a surjection StG ⊗ StG → H 0 (X, ω 1−p ), by [5, II
14.20]. The composite with H 0 (X, ω 1−p ) → k may be identified as in [6], [11]
with the natural pairing on the self dual representation StG . Thus we get

Theorem 3.1 (Pairing criterion) Assume there is an H-module map

                           St∗H ⊗ StH → St∗G ⊗ StG

whose composite with the evaluation map St∗G ⊗ StG → k is nonzero. Then
(G, H) is a Donkin pair.

Remark 3.2 Despite the notation, the H̃-module StH need not be an H-
module. Even if StH is not an H-module, St∗H ⊗ StH is one. It may be better
to replace H ⊂ G with the homomorphism H̃ → G̃. Thus an operation like
resG
   H would really mean restriction along H̃ → G̃.


Remark 3.3 The pairing criterion is satisfied if and only if G/B has an
H-canonical splitting. Indeed suppose we are given a map St∗H ⊗ StH =
StH ⊗ StH → H 0 (G/B, ω 1−p) as in Lemma 2.3. We have to factor it
through the surjection π : St∗G ⊗ StG → H 0 (G/B, ω 1−p ). But the ker-
nel K of π has good filtration by [8] (or by the proof in [5, II 4.16]), so
Ext1H (St∗H ⊗ StH , resG
                       H K) vanishes by theorem 2.4 and the main properties
of good filtrations ([8, Theorem 1], [5, II 4.13]).
    Now we illustrate the criterion with some old examples of Donkin pairs.

Example 3.4 Let G still be semisimple and connected. It is easy to see
from the formulas in the proof of [6, 3.2] that the pairing criterion applies to
the diagonal G inside a product G × · · · × G.



                                       3
Example 3.5 Let H be the commutator subgroup of a Levi subgroup of
a parabolic in the semisimple connected group G. Then, after passing to
simply connected covers if necessary, StH is a direct summand of resG
                                                                    H StG ,
so again the pairing criterion applies.

Lemma 3.6 Let (G, H) satisfy the pairing criterion and let X be a smooth
projective G-variety. If X has a G-canonical splitting, then it has an H-
canonical one.

Proof Use lemma 2.3.                                                         ✷

   The following lemma was pointed out to me by Jesper Funch Thomsen.

Lemma 3.7 Let X, Y be smooth projective G-varieties with canonical split-
ting. Then X × Y has a G-canonical splitting.

Proof Use example 3.4.                                                       ✷

Remark 3.8 For the users of our book, let us now point out how to get
theorem 2.4. We have G ×B X = G/B × X by remark [16, 1.2.2], so [16,
lemma 4.4.2] applies with Y = X in the notations of that lemma.

Remark 3.9 In lemma 3.7 one cannot replace G with B. Here is an exam-
ple. Take G = SL3 in characteristic 2 and let Z be the Demazure resolution
of a Schubert divisor. Then H 0 (Z, ωZ−1) is a nine dimensional B-module.
There is a fundamental representation V so that H 0 (Z, ωZ−1) is isomorphic to
a codimension one submodule of the degree three part of the ring of regular
functions on V . Using this, one checks with computer assisted computations
that Z, Z × Z, Z × Z × Z have B-canonical splittings, while Z × Z × Z × Z
does not have one.
   Our next aim is to treat the following example.

Example 3.10 For G we take the simply connected group of type E6 . From
the symmetry of its Dynkin diagram we have a graph automorphism which
is an involution. For H we take the group of fixed points of the involution.
It is connected ([15, 8.2]) of type F4 . It has been conjectured by Brundan [2,
4.4] that (G, H) is a Donkin pair.

                                      4
   More generally, with our usual notations we have.

Theorem 3.11 Assume there are dominant weights σ1 , σ2 , σ3 , so that

  1. The highest weight (p − 1)ρG of StG equals σ1 + σ2 + σ3 .

  2. σ1 + σ2 and σ2 + σ3 both restrict to the highest weight (p − 1)ρH of StH .

  3. The natural map ∇G (σ1 ) → ∇H (resB
                                       B∩H σ1 ) is surjective.

Then (G, H) is a Donkin pair. In fact it satisfies the pairing criterion.

Remark 3.12 If (G, H) is a Donkin pair and λ is dominant, then one knows
                                     H
that ∇G (λ) → ∇H (resB                          B−
                        B∩H λ) = indH∩B − (resH∩B − λ), induced by the projec-
tion of ∇G (λ) onto its highest weight space, is surjective. (Exercise. Use a
good filtration as in the proof of [5, II 4.16].)

Remark 3.13 Our theorem 3.11 also applies to the Levi subgroup case of
example 3.5 (take σ1 = 0). One hopes to find a more general method to
attack at least all graph automorphisms. Theorem 3.11 applies if the graph
automorphism is an involution and different simple roots in an orbit are
perpendicular to each other. But for the graph automorphism of a group of
type A2n in characteristic p > 2 there are no σ1 , σ2 , σ3 as in the theorem.
The coefficient of resBB∩H ρG with respect to the fundamental weight that
corresponds to the short root is four, which is too high.

Proof of Theorem 3.11.
We will often write the restriction of a weight to T ∩H with the same symbol
as the weight. We will repeatedly use basic properties of Weyl modules and
their duals. See [5, II 14.20] for surjectivity of cup product between dual
Weyl modules and [5, II 2.13] for Weyl modules as universal highest weight
modules. We first need a number of nonzero maps of H-modules. They are
natural up to nonzero scalars that do not interest us.
    The first map is the map

                          ǫH : ∇H (2(p − 1)ρH ) → k




                                      5
which detects Frobenius splittings on H/(H ∩ B). Together with the surjec-
tion
               ∇H (σ2 ) ⊗ ∇H ((p − 1)ρG ) → ∇H (2(p − 1)ρH )
it gives a nonzero map ∇H (σ2 ) ⊗ ∇H ((p − 1)ρG ) → k and hence a nonzero

                      η1 : ∇H (σ2 ) → ∇H ((p − 1)ρG )∗ .

   The map ∇G (σ2 + σ3 ) → StH is nonzero, hence surjective. The map
∇G (σ1 ) → ∇H (σ1 ) is surjective by assumption. In the commutative diagram

               ∇G (σ2 + σ3 ) ⊗ ∇G (σ1 ) −→      StG
                         ↓                        ↓
                   StH ⊗∇H (σ1 )        −→ ∇H ((p − 1)ρG )

the horizontal maps are also surjective. So the map

                         η2 : ∇H ((p − 1)ρG )∗ → St∗G

is injective. We obtain a nonzero

                            η2 η1 : ∇H (σ2 ) → St∗G .

The nonzero StH → ∇G (σ2 + σ3 ) combines with the map

                       ∇G (σ1 ) ⊗ ∇G (σ2 + σ3 ) → StG

to yield
                            ∇G (σ1 ) ⊗ StH → StG
and combining this with η2 η1 we get

                 η3 : ∇H (σ2 ) ⊗ ∇G (σ1 ) ⊗ StH → St∗G ⊗ StG .

We claim that its image is detected by the evaluation map

                             η4 : St∗G ⊗ StG → k.

This is because η3 factors through ∇H ((p − 1)ρG )∗ ⊗ StG , on which the re-
striction of η4 factors through ∇H ((p − 1)ρG )∗ ⊗ ∇H ((p − 1)ρG ), the map η1
is nonzero, the image of ∇G (σ1 ) ⊗ StH → StG maps onto ∇H ((p − 1)ρG ).


                                       6
    From the nontrivial η4 η3 we get a nontrivial

                            η5 : ∇H (σ2 ) ⊗ ∇G (σ1 ) → St∗H .

Then η5 must be split surjective. Choose a left inverse

                            η6 : St∗H → ∇H (σ2 ) ⊗ ∇G (σ1 )

of η5 . It leads to

                      η7 : St∗H ⊗ StH → ∇H (σ2 ) ⊗ ∇G (σ1 ) ⊗ StH

and the map we use in the pairing criterion is η3 η7 . Indeed the map St∗H →
St∗H defined by η4 η3 η7 equals η5 η6 , hence is nonzero.                  ✷


4     The E6-F4 pair.
We turn to the E6 -F4 pair of example 3.10. First observe that for p > 13
one could simply follow the method of [2] to prove that the pair is a Donkin
pair. Indeed the restriction to F4 of a fundamental representation then has its
dominant weights in the bottom alcove. Looking a little closer and applying
the linkage principle one can treat p ≥ 11 in the same manner.
    But for p = 5 one has ̟4 ↑ ̟1 + ̟4 and for p = 7 one has ̟1 ↑
̟1 + ̟4 . This makes that one has more trouble to see that the restriction
of ∇G (̟4 ) has a good filtration with respective layers ∇H (̟1 ), ∇H (̟3 ),
∇H (̟3 ), ∇H (̟1 + ̟4 ), ∇H (̟2 ). For p = 2 or p = 3 it is even worse.
    So let us apply theorem 3.11 instead. We take σ1 = (p − 1)(̟1 + ̟3 ),
σ2 = (p − 1)(̟2 + ̟4 ), σ3 = (p − 1)(̟5 + ̟6 ) in the notations of Bourbaki
for E6 [1, Planches]. Then resB    B∩H ̟i equals ̟4 , ̟1 , ̟3 , ̟2 , ̟3 , ̟4 for
i = 1, . . . , 6 respectively.
    First let let p = 2. Then ∇H (resB    B∩H σ1 ) = ∇H (̟3 + ̟4 ) is irreducible.
Indeed its dominant weights come in two parts. The weights 0, ̟4 , ̟1 , ̟3 ,
2̟4 , ̟1 + ̟4 , ̟2 lie in one orbit, and the highest weight lies in a different
orbit under the affine Weyl group. To be more specific, ̟1 − ρH ↑ ̟3 + ̟4 ,
but ̟4 − ρH ↑ 0 ↑ ̟4 ↑ ̟1 ↑ ̟3 ↑ 2̟4 ↑ ̟1 + ̟4 ↑ ̟2 . So ∇G (σ1 ) →
∇H (resB B∩H σ1 ) is surjective.
    Remains the case p > 2. To see that ∇G (λ) → ∇H (resB      B∩H λ) is surjective
for λ = σ1 , it suffices to do this for λ = ̟1 and λ = ̟3 . For p > 3 one
could now use that ∇H (resB    B∩H λ) is irreducible for both λ = ̟1 and λ = ̟3 ,


                                           7
because each of the dominant weights of ∇H (resB       B∩H λ) is in a different orbit
under the affine Weyl group.
     But we need an argument that works for p ≥ 3. Now ∇G (̟1 ) is a
miniscule representation of dimension 27, and ∇H (̟4 ) = ∇H (resB              B∩H ̟1 )
has dimension 26. There are 24 short roots and they have multiplicity one
in ∇H (̟4 ). So the map from M := ∇G (̟1 ) to ∇H (̟4 ) hits at least 24
dimensions and its kernel consists of H-invariants. Indeed there are three
weights of ∇G (̟1 ) that restrict to zero. In Bourbaki notation they are ζ1 =
1/6(ǫ8 −ǫ7 −ǫ6 )+1/2(−ǫ1 +ǫ2 +ǫ3 −ǫ4 −ǫ5 ), ζ2 = 1/6(ǫ8 −ǫ7 −ǫ6 )+1/2(ǫ1 −ǫ2 −
ǫ3 + ǫ4 − ǫ5 ), ζ3 = −1/3(ǫ8 − ǫ7 − ǫ6 ) + ǫ5 . Put ζ4 = 1/6(ǫ8 − ǫ7 − ǫ6 ) + 1/2(ǫ1 −
ǫ2 − ǫ3 − ǫ4 + ǫ5 ), ζ5 = 1/6(ǫ8 − ǫ7 − ǫ6 ) + 1/2(−ǫ1 + ǫ2 − ǫ3 + ǫ4 − ǫ5 ). Then Xα1
induces an isomorphism Mζ3 → Mζ4 and it annihilates Mζ1 + Mζ2 . Similarly
Xα6 induces an isomorphism Mζ2 → Mζ4 and annihilates Mζ1 + Mζ3 . The
same space is annihilated by Xα3 , which induces an isomorphism Mζ2 → Mζ5 .
Finally Xα5 induces an isomorphism Mζ1 → Mζ5 and annihilates Mζ2 + Mζ3 .
     It follows that in Mζ1 +Mζ2 +Mζ3 there is just a one dimensional subspace
of vectors annihilated by both Xα1 + Xα6 and Xα3 + Xα5 . (These two oper-
ators come from the Lie algebra of H.) We conclude that resG          H M has a good
filtration and that M → ∇H (̟4 ) is surjective. As p > 2, we then also have
that M ∧ M and resG      H (M ∧ M) have a good filtration. It then follows from
the character that M ∧ M = ∇G (̟3 ). (We use the program LiE [17].) So
resGH ∇G (̟3 ) has a good filtration and therefore maps onto ∇G (resB∩H ̟3 ).
                                                                              B

     Summing up, we have shown

Theorem 4.1 The E6 -F4 pair is a Donkin pair. In fact it satisfies the pairing
criterion.

Remark 4.2 When Steve Donkin received this proof, he proceeded to show
that one could also prove E6 -F4 to be a Donkin pair with the ‘ancient methods’
of his book [3]. Of course he had to treat more representations than we do.
We will use his method in the last section to treat the remaining cases of
Brundan’s conjecture in characteristic p > 2, where we have no alternative
yet.




                                          8
5    Induction and canonical splitting
We finish the discussion of canonical splittings with an analogue of propo-
sition [9, 5.5]. It makes a principle from [8] more explicit. The result was
explained to us by O. Mathieu at a reception of the mayor of Aarhus in Au-
gust 1998. It shows once more that canonical splittings combine well with
Demazure desingularisation of Schubert varieties.

Proposition 5.1 Let X be a projective B-variety with canonical splitting.
Let P be a minimal parabolic. Then P ×B X has a canonical splitting.

Corollary 5.2 The same conclusion holds for any parabolic subgroup.

Proof If P is not minimal, take a Demazure resolution Z = P1 ×B P2 ×B
· · · ×B Pr /B of P/B and apply the proposition to get a canonical splitting on
P1 ×B P2 ×B · · · ×B Pr ×B X. Then push the splitting forward ([10, Prop. 4])
to P ×B X.                                                                    ✷

Proof of Proposition We use notations as in [16, Ch. 4, A.4]. Let ζ be
the highest weight of St and s the simple reflection corresponding with P .
One checks as in [16, A.4.6] that

             EndF (P ×B X) = (P ×B EndF (X)) ⊗ π ∗ L(sζ − ζ),

where π : P ×B X → P/B. We are given a map φ : kζ ⊗ St → EndF (X).
The required map ψ : kζ ⊗ St → EndF (P ×B X) may be constructed by
composing maps

                                                   kζ ⊗ St   ∼
                                                             =
                                              P
                                  k−sζ ⊗ indB (kζ+sζ ⊗ St)   →
                             k−sζ ⊗ indPB (ksζ ⊗ EndF (X))   ∼
                                                             =
              k−sζ   ⊗ H 0(P ×B X, P ×B (EndF (X)[sζ]))      ∼
                                                             =
                                 EndF (P ×B X, B ×B X)       →
                                           EndF (P ×B X)

Here k−sζ is identified with the weight space of weight −sζ of

                            H 0 (P ×B X, π ∗ L(−ζ)).

                                       9
An element of that weight space has divisor (p − 1)B ×B X = (p − 1)X.
   To see that the image of ψ is not in the kernel of

                         ǫP ×B X : EndF (P ×B X) → k,

it suffices to show that the diagram

         kζ ⊗ St → EndF (P ×B X, B ×B X) → EndF (P ×B X)
            k                ↓                    ↓
                   φ
         kζ ⊗ St →                 EndF (X)       →           k

commutes. Now
                  k−sζ ⊗ indPB (kζ+sζ ⊗ St)  −→ kζ ⊗ St
                              ↓                    ↓
                          P
                k−sζ ⊗ indB (ksζ ⊗ EndF (X)) −→ EndF (X)

commutes and by restricting to the trivial fibration BsB×B X → BsB/B one
shows through the following lemma that the bottom map in this last diagram
agrees with the map that factors through EndF (P ×B X, B ×B X).          ✷

Lemma 5.3 Let A be a commutative k-algebra. Then

           EndF (A[t]) = EndF (A) ⊗ EndF (k[t]) = EndF (A) ⊗ k[t]

and the map EndF (A[t], (t)) → EndF (A) is induced by the map

        tp−1 k[t] = tp−1 ∗ EndF (k[t]) = EndF (k[t], (t)) → EndF (k) = k

which sends tp−1 f (t) to f (0).

Proof Straightforward, provided one keeps in mind how EndF (R) is an
R-module ([16, 4.3.3]). Compare also [16, A.4.5].                  ✷


6     More Donkin pairs
In this section we do not use the pairing criterion. Instead we return to
the methods of Donkin’s book [3], combined with computer calculations of
characters, of linkage, and of the Jantzen sum formula.

                                         10
    Let G, H be as before, with G simply connected. In fact H will be
the commutator subgroup of the group of fixed points of an involution of G
which leaves invariant the maximal torus T and the Borel subgroup B. We
refer to [14] for the classification of the possibilities, assuming p > 2. (Of
course involutions of the simply connected G are lifted [15, 9.16] from the
involutions of the corresponding adjoint group, which are treated in [14].)

Remark 6.1 Let H be the fixed point group of an involution that leaves T
and B invariant in the simply connected semisimple G. Then H is connected
reductive by [15, 8.2]. Now an H-module has good filtration in the sense of
[3] if and only if its restriction to the commutator subgroup of H has good
filtration. That is why we look only at semisimple subgroups H.
     Let M denote the set of finite dimensional G-modules M with good
filtration for which resG
                        H M has good filtration. Let S denote the set of
dominant weights λ of G so that ∇G (λ) ∈ M. As always we try to show
that all dominant weights of G are in S. For this purpose we recall some
useful lemmas.

Lemma 6.2        1. If M1 ⊕ M2 ∈ M, then M1 ∈ M.

  2. If 0 → M ′ → M → M ′′ → 0 is exact, and M ′ ∈ M, then M ∈ M if
     and only if M ′′ ∈ M.

  3. If M1 , M2 ∈ M, then M1 ⊗ M2 ∈ M.
     If M is a G-module with good filtration, write supp∇ (M) for the set of
dominant weights λ so that ∇G (λ) occurs as a layer in a good filtration of
M. We order the dominant weights of G by the partial order in which µ ≤ λ
if and only if λ − µ is in the closed cone spanned by the positive roots. In
particular, if λ is dominant, then 0 ≤ λ, and all dominant weights µ of ∇G (λ)
satisfy µ ≤ λ. We say that a filtration of M is a good filtration adapted to
the partial order if there are λi so that the i-th layer is a direct sum of copies
of ∇G (λi ), and i ≤ j if λi ≤ λj . (So we still call it a good filtration, even
though ∇G (λi ) may have multiplicity in the i-th layer.) If M has a good
filtration, then it also has one adapted to the partial order, by the proof of
[5, II 4.16].

Lemma 6.3 Let M ∈ M and λ ∈ supp∇ (M). Assume for every weight µ
in supp∇ (M), distinct from λ, that one of the following holds

                                       11
  1. µ < λ and µ ∈ S.

  2. µ and λ are in different orbits under the affine Weyl group.

Then λ ∈ S.

Proof We may replace M by an indecomposable direct summand M1 with
λ ∈ supp∇ (M1 ). The linkage principle tells that we thus get rid of the second
possibility in the lemma. Then in a good filtration adapted to the partial
order, the module ∇G (λ) occurs only as a summand of the top layer, which
is in M by lemma 6.2.                                                         ✷

Lemma 6.4 Let λ be a dominant weight of G. If λ is in the bottom alcove,
or if the Jantzen sum formula yields zero, then ∇G (λ) is irreducible.

Proof See [5, II Cor. 5.6 and 8.21]                                          ✷

6.5    The pairs E8, D8 and E8, E7 A1
Say G is of type E8 in characteristic p > 2 and H is the fixed point group
of an involution. There are two cases, up to conjugacy. One may have H of
type D8 or one may have H of type E7 A1 .
    In either case we wish to show that G, H is a Donkin pair. In other words,
we want that all dominant weights are in S. We will argue by induction along
the partial order. Thus when trying to prove that λ ∈ S, we shall always
assume that µ ∈ S for µ < λ. Of course the zero weight is in S, so say λ
is nonzero. If λ is not a fundamental weight, write λ = λ1 + λ2 where λi
are nonzero dominant weights. As λi < λ, we may apply lemma 6.3 with
M = ∇G (λ1 ) ⊗ ∇G (λ2 ) to conclude that λ ∈ S.
    Remain the fundamental weights. Observe that ̟8 < ̟1 < ̟7 < ̟2 <
̟6 < ̟3 < ̟5 < ̟4 . But we will not discuss them in this exact order.
    To see that ̟8 ∈ S we compute the character of resG    H ∇G (̟8 ) with the
program LiE [17], decompose this character in terms of Weyl characters, and
use lemma 6.4 to see that resGH ∇G (̟8 ) has a composition series whose factors
are irreducible (dual) Weyl modules. Here we use a Java applet of Lauritzen
for the Jantzen sum formula.
    To see that ̟1 ∈ S we may argue the same way if H is of type D8 .
If H is of type E7 A1 , let K be the subgroup of type E7 in H, and F the


                                      12
subgroup of type A1 . Then G, K is a Donkin pair (Levi subgroup case), so
we may consider a good filtration adapted to the partial order (on weights
for K) of resGK ∇G (̟1 ). It is a filtration by H-modules. It suffices to show
that its layers have good filtration as H-modules. Let N be such a layer. Its
character is the character of some ∇H (λ1 , λ2 ) where λ1 is a dominant weight
for K and λ2 is one for F . (From now on we do not mention the computer
calculations that are needed to support such statements.) Moreover, ∇F (λ2 )
is irreducible, so that the K ∩ B-socle of N is an irreducible F -module. It
follows that the natural map N → ∇H (λ1 , λ2 ) is an isomorphism, and thus
̟1 ∈ S.
    To see that ̟2 ∈ S, we apply lemma 6.3 with M = ∇G (̟1 ) ⊗ ∇G (̟8 ).
(Note ̟1 , ̟8 < ̟2 , so that indeed M ∈ M by the inductive assumption.)
One may find the necessary statement about linkage in Donkin’s book. (This
is no accident, as we follow him in our choices.) We also checked the non-
linkage with a straightforward Mathematica program.
    To see that ̟7 ∈ S, we similarly use M = ∇G (̟8 ) ∧ ∇G (̟8 ). (Recall
p > 2.) To get ̟3 ∈ S, use M = ∇G (̟1 ) ∧ ∇G (̟1 ). To get ̟4 ∈ S, use
M = ∇G (̟2 )∧∇G (̟2 ). To get ̟5 ∈ S, use M = ∇G (̟1 )⊗∇G (̟2 ) if p = 3,
and M = ∧4 ∇G (̟8 ) if p > 3. To get ̟6 ∈ S, use M = ∇G (̟1 ) ⊗ ∇G (̟1 ) if
p = 3, and M = ∧3 ∇G (̟8 ) if p > 3.

6.6    The pair E6, A5 A1
Let G be the simply connected group of type E6 in characteristic p > 2 and
let H be the fixed point group of such an inner involution that H is of type
A5 A1 and the involution commutes with the graph automorphism. We wish
to show again this is a Donkin pair. We argue as in the E8 , E7 A1 case.
    If λ = ̟1 or ̟2 , then we argue with socles as we did to show ̟1 ∈ S for
the E8 , E7 A1 pair.
    To treat ̟3 we use M = ∇G (̟1 ) ∧ ∇G (̟1 ). To get ̟4 ∈ S, use M =
∇G (̟2 ) ∧ ∇G (̟2 ). The remaining two fundamental weights are in S by
symmetry.

6.7    The pair E6, C4
Let G be the simply connected group of type E6 in characteristic p > 2 and
let H be the fixed point group of such an outer involution that H is of type
C4 and the involution commutes with the graph automorphism.

                                     13
    The module ∇G (̟2 ) is the Lie algebra of the adjoint form of G. Its restric-
tion resG
        H ∇G (̟2 ) has a six dimensional weight space for the weight zero, just
like ∇G (̟2 ) itself. We claim that it contains no nonzero invariant. Indeed we
may choose the involution so that Xα3 + Xα5 , Xα1 + Xα6 , Xα3 +α4 + Xα5 +α4 ,
Xα2 are in the Lie algebra of H, where we have put Xα3 +α4 = [Xα3 , Xα4 ]
and Xα5 +α4 = [Xα4 , Xα5 ]. The only element in the weight zero weight space
of ∇G (̟2 ) that is annihilated by all these elements is the zero vector. Now
resG
   H ∇G (̟2 ) contains an irreducible ∇H (2̟1 ) and the quotient by that sub-
module is either irreducible, or p = 3 and there are two composition factors,
one of which is one dimensional. (This also uses the Jantzen sum formula.)
As there is no invariant in resG H ∇G (̟2 ) and there is no extension between
∇H (2̟1 ) and the other composition factors ([5, II 4.13, 4.14]), we get ̟2 ∈ S.
    As resG
          H ∇G (̟1 ) is irreducible, we also have ̟1 ∈ S. The rest goes as for
the pair E6 , A5 A1 .

6.8    The pairs E7, A7 and E7 , D6 A1
Say G is simply connected of type E7 in characteristic p > 2 and H is the
fixed point group of an involution. There are two cases, up to conjugacy.
One may have H of type A7 or one may have H of type D6 A1 .
    We argue as before. If H is of type D6 A1 we show that ̟1 , ̟2 , ̟7 ∈ S
by the argument with socles used to show ̟1 ∈ S for the E8 , E7 A1 pair.
If H is of type A7 we have ̟1 , ̟7 ∈ S for the same reason, involving the
sum formula, as why ̟8 ∈ S for the E8 , D8 pair. If p = 7 we see in the
same manner that ̟2 ∈ S. If p 6= 7 use M = ∇G (̟1 ) ⊗ ∇G (̟7 ) to get
̟2 ∈ S. To get ̟3 ∈ S use M = ∇G (̟1 ) ∧ ∇G (̟1 ). To get ̟4 ∈ S use
M = ∇G (̟2 )∧∇G (̟2 ). To get ̟5 ∈ S use M = ∧3 ∇G (̟7 ) if p 6= 3 and M =
∇G (̟1 ) ∧ ∇G (̟2 ) otherwise. To get ̟6 ∈ S use M = ∇G (̟7 ) ∧ ∇G (̟7 ).

6.9    The pairs F4, B4 and F4, C3 A1
Say G is of type F4 in characteristic p > 2 and H is the fixed point group
of an involution. There are two cases, up to conjugacy. One may have H of
type B4 or one may have H of type C3 A1 .
    We argue as before. If H is of type C3 A1 we show that ̟1 , ̟4 ∈ S
by the argument with socles used to show ̟1 ∈ S for the E8 , E7 A1 pair.
If H is of type B4 we have ̟1 , ̟4 ∈ S for the same reason, involving the


                                       14
sum formula, as why ̟8 ∈ S for the E8 , D8 pair. To get ̟3 ∈ S use
M = ∇G (̟4 ) ∧ ∇G (̟4 ). To get ̟2 ∈ S use M = ∇G (̟1 ) ∧ ∇G (̟1 ).

Theorem 6.10 (Brundan’s Conjecture [2]) Let G be semisimple simply
connected. If either

  (i) H is the centralizer of a graph automorphism of G; or

 (ii) H is the centralizer of an involution of G and the characteristic is at
      least three,

then G, H is a Donkin pair.

Proof
We have either a Levi subgroup case, first settled in [3] (see also remarks 3.5,
6.1), or a case treated in [2], or a case treated above, up to conjugacy.     ✷

Remark 6.11 Of course we would much prefer a case-free proof, based on
the pairing criterion say.
