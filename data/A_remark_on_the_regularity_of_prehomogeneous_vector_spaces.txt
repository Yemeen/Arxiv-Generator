                    PREHOMOGENEOUS VECTOR SPACES

    Let k be a eld, G a reductive group over k, and V a rational representation of
G. Note that the reductiveness includes the condition that G is smooth over k. Let
e 2 G be the unit element. Throughout this paper, we assume that there exists
w 2 Vk such that U = Gw is Zariski open in V .
    A non-constant polynomial (x) 2 k[V ] is called a relative invariant polynomial
if there exists a character  (which is automatically rational) such that (gx) =
(g )(x) for all g 2 G; x 2 V . A pair (G; V ) as above is sometimes called a
prehomogeneous vector space (see [7], [6]), but this terminology is also used with
an additional assumption of the existence of a relative invariant polynomial.
    Let Gw be the scheme theoretic stabilizer of w in G. This is a group scheme
and it may not always be reduced. For any scheme X over k and a k-algebra R,
XR is the set of R-rational points of X . The purpose of this paper is to prove the
following theorem algebraically.
Theorem Suppose Gw is reductive. Then
(1) V n U is a hypersurface, and
(2) Uksep is a single Gksep -orbit set-theoretically.
    Note that the assumption in the above theorem includes the smoothness of Gw
over the ground led k. The above theorem is well known if ch k = 0.
    Before proving the above theorem, we recall properties of smooth morphisms.
Let f : X ! Y be a morphism of k-schemes of nite type, and 
1X=Y the sheaf
of relative dierentials. Then f is, by denition, smooth of relative dimension n if
f is at and for each point y 2 Y , the absolute ber f 1 (y )  Spec k(y ) (k(y ) is
the algebraic closure) is regular of equidimension n. An alternative denition (see
Denition (1.1) [1, p. 128]) is that locally f is etale over an ane n-space over
Y . It is easy to see that smoothness is preserved by base change. It satises the
property of \faithfully at descent" (see Corollary (5.11) [1, p. 154]). Therefore,
if f : X ! Y is a morphism between k-schemes of nite type, f is smooth if and
only if the induced map X  Spec k ! Y  Spec k is smooth. In particular, if X is
a k-scheme X is smooth over k if and only if it is regular after changing the base
to k. With these in mind, the equivalence of the the two denitions is proved in

Theorem (1.8) [1, p. 130]. These denitions are equivalent to the one given in [2]
also (see Theorem (10.2) [2, p. 269]).
   An easy consequence of the second denition is that if X is smooth over a eld
k, the set Xksep is Zariski dense in X . Suppose that k is algebraically closed, and
both X; Y are smooth over k. An important criterion of smoothness is that f is
smooth if and only if for all x 2 X , the induced map between the tangent spaces
Tx X ! Tf (x) Y is surjective (see Corollary (5.5) [1, p. 149]). Also if f : X ! Y
is smooth and X is smooth over k, Y is smooth over k. One can see this in the
following manner.
   Let f (x) = y and h : X ! An  Y (An is the ane n-space) be an etale
morphism in a neighborhood of x such that the composition with the projection to
Y is f . Let h(x) = (z; y ), and pr1 ; pr2 be the projections from An  Y to An ; Y .
Then by Proposition (4.9) [1, p. 117],
                
1X=k 
                      = h 
1(An Y )=k 
                                         = h (pr1 
1An =k  pr2 
1Y =k )
in a neighborhood of x. Since f is surjective, it is easy to see that dim 
1Y =k 
 k(y) =
dim Y for all y 2 Y . Therefore, by the denition of smoothness in [2, p. 268], Y is
smooth over k.
     Now we are ready to prove the theorem.
Proof of Theorem. We may assume that k is separably closed. We rst assume that
k is algebraically closed.
     Let F1 ;    ; Fn be irreducible codimension one components of V n U , F = F1 [
  [ Fn , and W = V n F . Then W is ane, U  W , and the codimension of W n U
in W is greater than one. Let G = Spec R, and S = RGw (the ring of invariants).
Then the geometric quotient X = G=Gw exists, it is ane (in fact X = Spec S ),
and the map f : G ! X is smooth (see Proposition 0.9, Amplication 1.3 [5, pp.
16,30]). The point here is that S is nitely generated because of Haboush's theorem
(see [5, p. 191]). By properties of smooth morphisms, X is smooth over k. Because
of the universal property of the quotient, the map G ! U dened by g ! gw
factors through X .
     Since G; V are smooth over k, dim Tw U = dim U = dim V and dim Te G = dim G
(Tw U , etc., are tangent spaces). Since G ! X is a principal ber bundle and the
generic ber is isomorphic to Gw , dim G = dim X + dim Gw = dim U + dim Gw .
Note that the map X ! U is set-theoretically bijective, because X is the geometric
quotient. Therefore, dim Gw = dim Te G dim Tw U . Since Gw is smooth over k,
                   dim Gw = dim Te Gw = dim Ker(Te G ! Tw U ):
Therefore,
                     dim Ker(TeG ! Tw U ) = dim Te G dim Tw U:
This proves that Te G ! Tw U is surjective.
   Since the map G ! U is G-equivariant, it induces surjective maps of tangent
spaces. So that is the case for X ! U also. Since both X; U are smooth over k,
this implies that X ! U is smooth. Since the map X ! U is of relative dimension
zero, it is etale. Since this map is set-theoretically bijective, X is isomorphic to U
                                             2
and U is ane. Since W is smooth over k, it is normal in particular. Since the
codimension of W n U in W is greater than one, any regular function on U extends
to W . Since both U; W are ane, U = W . This proves (1). The statement (2) is
obvious if k is algebraically closed.
    We now consider arbitrary k (but we may still assume k is separably closed).
Let X = Spec S again. Since Gwk is Zariski dense in Gw , it is easy to see that
                                 (R 
 k)Gwk  = S 
 k:
This implies that S is nitely generated over k and X  Spec k is the geometric
quotient (G  Spec k)=(Gw  Spec k). The k-scheme X obviously has the universal
property of the quotient in the category of k-schemes. Therefore, the map G !
U dened by g ! gw still factors through X . By the previous step, the map
X  Spec k ! U  Spec k is an isomorphism. Therefore, the map X ! U is
an isomorphism also. So U is ane and the statement (1) follows by the same
argument as in the previous step.
   Let f be the map G ! X again. Since f is smooth, for any point x 2 Uk , the
ber f 1(x) over x is smooth over k. Since k is separably closed, we may choose a
k-rational point g 2 f 1 (x). Then gw = x, and this proves (2). 
    The reason why we proved the above theorem is the following. For simplicity,
let's consider a pair (G; V ) as above such that V is an irreducible representation.
If ch k = 0, a pair (G; V ) as above is called regular if there exists a relative
invariant polynomial (x) whose Hessian is not identically zero. This denition is
equivalent to the existence of a generic point w whose stabilizer is reductive. Let
V ss = fx 2 V j (x) 6= 0g. Because of the irreducibility, (x) is essentially unique.
So the regularity implies that Vkss is a single Gk -orbit. If ch k = 0, k = ksep , and
Igusa showed in [3, p. 269] that
                       Gk n Vkss 
                                 = Ker(H1 (k; Gw ) ! H1 (k; G))
(H1 (k; Gw ); H1(k; G) are Galois cohomology sets).
    We considered the question of rational orbit decompositions for certain regular
prehomogeneous vector spaces in [8], [4] in all the characteristics, and we had to
worry about the separability. Because of the above theorem, all we have to do is to
make sure that Gw is smooth and reductive, and by exactly the same argument as in
[3], we have the above interpretation of Gk n Vkss in terms of Galois cohomology sets,
and we no longer have to worry about the separability. This was the motivation
of this paper. Of course, we still have to show that Gw is reductive, but that is
necessary anyway to determine the orbit space Gk n Vkss, and in many cases, it can
be worked out by case by case analysis as in [6].
    Finally, we point out that once we show that Gw is reductive without knowing
Gw is open, the condition dim Gw = dim G dim V implies Gw is open as in the
case of ch k = 0. To see this, we may assume k is algebraically closed. Then since
Gw is integral, the set of non-singular points is a non-empty open set (see Theorem
5.3 [2, p. 33]). The geometric quotient X = G=Gw still exists, it is smooth over
k, and the map X ! Gw is bijective. So bers of G ! Gw and bers of G ! X
are set-theoretically the same. Then by Propositions 9.1, 9.7 [2, pp. 256, 257],
dim Gw = dim G dim Gw = dim V . Since Gw is a locally closed set (since it is
constructible and irreducible) and G acts transitively on it, it is open in V .
