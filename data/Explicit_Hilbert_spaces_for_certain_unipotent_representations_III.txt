                                             0     Introduction
                                             This paper is the culmination of a series dedicated to the problem of constructing
                                             explicit analytic models for small unitary representations of certain semisimple
                                             Lie groups. (See [S1], [S2], [S3], [DS1], [DS2] and also [SS], [KS].)
                                                 The groups G that we consider are those that arise from real semisimple
                                             Jordan algebras via the Tits-Koecher-Kantor construction. Such a G is char-
                                             acterized by the fact that it admits a parabolic subgroup P = LN which is
                                             conjugate to its opposite P = LN , and for which the nilradicals N and N are
                                             abelian. We identify N and N with their Lie algebras n and n via the expo-
                                             nential map, and moreover we identify n with n∗ via a suitably rescaled Killing
                                             form. The space n is naturally endowed with a real semisimple Jordan algebra
                                             structure, which is isotopic to the one giving rise to G and P . We write n for
                                             the rank of n as a Jordan algebra.
                                                 In this situation, the Levi component L has a finite number of orbits on
                                             n; each orbit has a rank ≤ n, and carries a measure dµ which transforms
                                             by a character under L. For the non-open orbits (rank < n) this measure is
                                             unique up to scalar multiple; for the open orbits (rank = n) there is a one-
                                             parameter family of such measures. For each non-open orbit O we consider the
                                             Hilbert space HO = L2 (O, dµ). By Mackey theory this space carries a natural
                                             irreducible unitary representation πO of P , and we consider the following two
                                             problems:

                                                 • Extend πO to a unitary representation of G.
                                                 • Decompose πO1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ πOs , for rank O1 + ... + rank Os ≤ n.

                                                For Euclidean Jordan algebras the first problem was solved in [S1] and [S2],
                                             and the second problem was solved in [DS1]. Therefore in this paper we restrict

our attention to non-Euclidean Jordan algebras. The case of rank 1 orbits in
non-Euclidean Jordan algebras was completely settled in [DS2]. It turned out
that for rank 1 orbits in certain rank 2 Jordan algebras the representation πO
cannot be extended to G. We shall call these orbits inadmissible; they arise for
the groups G = O(p, q), p 6= q and are connected with the Howe-Vogan “no-go”
result for minimal representations of such groups ([V]). For rank 1 orbits in the
remaining Jordan algebras we established the desired extension and calculated
the tensor product decomposition in [DS2].
   In this paper we consider the general case, and prove the following results:
   First suppose O is an admissible non-open orbit in a non-Euclidean Jordan
algebra N .

Theorem 0.1 For O as above, the representation πO of P extends to an irre-
ducible spherical unitary representation of G on HO .

   Now suppose O1 , . . . , Os are admissible non-open orbits in N such that
rank O1 +...+rank Os ≤ n. In subsection 4.2 we define a reductive homogeneous
space G′ /H ′ , essentially the generic fiber of the addition map from O1 ×. . .×Os
to N , and consider the decomposition of the quasi-regular representation
                                           Z ⊕
                           L2 (G′ /H ′ ) =     m(σ)σ dρ(σ),
                                        c′
                                        G

where m(σ) is the multiplicity function and dρ(σ) is the Plancherel measure.

Theorem 0.2 Let O1 , . . . , Os and G′ , H ′ be as above; then there is a map θ
from the H ′ -spherical dual of G′ to the unitary dual of G such that
                                         Z ⊕
                     πO1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ πOs =     m(σ)θ(σ) dρ(σ).
                                            c′
                                            G

    Our approach to these results requires consideration of three different kinds
of groups, each with its own flavor of representation theory. These are:

   • Harish-Chandra modules for semisimple Lie groups.
   • Operator algebras for parabolic subgroups.
   • Fourier analysis for abelian nilradicals.

    The Harish-Chandra theory was studied in [S3]. The necessary operator-
algebraic results (C ∗ -algebras, von Neumann algebras) were already obtained
in [DS1] and [DS2]. Thus the missing ingredient, which is provided by this
paper, involves abelian Fourier analysis. The key result, Proposition 3.2, shows
that a certain function (eventually, the “spherical” vector in πO ) belongs to
L2 (O, dµ). For rank 1 orbits this result was obtained in [DS2] by establishing
a close connection between this function and a certain one-variable Bessel K-
function. The required L2 -estimate was then deduced from a precise knowledge
of the singularity of the Bessel K-function at 0.

                                        2
    For higher rank orbits, we expect that there should exist a similar connection
between the spherical vectors and multivariate Bessel K-functions. However in
order to exploit this connection one would have to first develop the theory of
such functions, possibly along the lines of the theory of the multivariate Bessel
J-functions of [Op]. While we feel that the connection with multivariate Bessel
K-functions is of interest and should be pursued further, in the present paper
we follow a different approach that allows us to obtain the desired estimate
directly, obviating the need to first study Bessel functions. The key here is a
“stability” result (Lemma 3.12) which transfers the problem from a non-open
orbit to a related problem on the open orbit for a smaller group. The open orbit
problem turns out to be easier to solve.
    This approach was inspired in part by a recent paper of Shimura [Sh]. We
wish to thank L. Barchini for drawing our attention to this paper.


1     Preliminaries
In this section we recall basic facts about the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction.
All results of this section are well-known. More details may be found in [KS],
[DS2] and in the references therein (in particular, [BK] and [Lo]).

1.1     The pair (G, P )
The Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction associates to a real simple Jordan alge-
bra, a pair (G, P ), where G is a real simple Lie group with Cartan involution
θ, and maximal compact subgroup K; and P is a parabolic subgroup with
Levi decomposition LN , say. In the context of Lie theory, these pairs can be
characterized as follows:

    1. N is abelian.
    2. P is G-conjugate to its opposite parabolic P = θ(P ) = LN .

    Conversely, in the above situation one can endow N with the structure of a
real simple Jordan algebra, unique up to the choice of an identity element.
    In view of the classification of real simple Lie groups and their parabolic
subgroups in terms of the possible restricted root systems, it is an easy matter
to determine the above pairs. The two conditions correspond to simple restricted
roots α such that

    1. α has coefficient 1 in the highest root
    2. α satisfies α = −w0 α for the longest element w0 of the Weyl group.

   The conditions 1. and 2. each give rise to a symmetric space denoted by K/M
and L/H respectively, and much of the relevant information about the Jordan
algebra and the associated pair (G, P ) can be described in a simple and coherent
manner in terms of these symmetric spaces. This makes it possible to have a

                                         3
uniform discussion for the most part, with only some occasional arguments
requiring case-by-case considerations.
    In the next few sections we describe these spaces and conclude by giving a
complete list of examples.
    We follow the practice of denoting the real Lie algebras of various Lie groups
by the corresponding fraktur letters; with the exception of p which will denote
instead the −1 eigenspace of θ in the Cartan decomposition g = k ⊕ p.

1.2    The symmetric space K/M
Condition 1. implies (and is equivalent to the assertion) that the subgroup L is
a symmetric subgroup of G, and M = K ∩ L is a symmetric subgroup of K.
Let t be a maximal toral subalgebra for the compact symmetric space K/M ,
i.e. a Cartan subspace for in the orthogonal complement of m in k. The real
rank of N as a Jordan algebra is n = dimR t.
    The roots of tC in gC always form a root system of type Cn , and we fix a
basis {γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γn } of t∗ such that

                        Σ(tC , gC ) = {±(γi ± γj )/2, ±γj }.

For the subsystem Σ = Σ(tC , kC ), there are three possibilities:

            An−1 = {±(γi − γj )/2}, Dn = {±(γi ± γj )/2}, and Cn .

    The first of these cases arises precisely when N is a Euclidean Jordan algebra.
This case was studied in [S1], therefore we restrict our attention to the last two
cases. If Σ is Cn , there are two multiplicities, corresponding to the short and
long roots, which we denote by d and e, respectively. If Σ is Dn , and n 6= 2,
then there is a single multiplicity, which we denote by d, so that Dn may be
regarded as a special case of Cn , with e = 0.
    The root system D2 ≈ A1 × A1 is reducible and there are two (possibly dif-
ferent) root multiplicities. In what follows, we explicitly exclude the case when
these multiplicities are different. This means that we exclude from consideration
the groups

                       G = O(p, q), N = Rp−1,q−1 (p 6= q).

When the two multiplicities coincide (p = q), we once again denote the common
multiplicity by d.

1.3    S-triples and the Cayley transform
The discussion of the various cases can be made uniform by emphasizing the
special role played by a family of n commuting SL2 ’s or S-triples, together with
the associated Cayley transform.




                                         4
    For the Lie algebra sl2 (C), we define
                                                      
                   0 1              0 0              1 0
            x=             , y=             , h=             ,
                   0 0              1 0              0 −1
                                                                      
                 1 i 1               1 −i 1                   0        1
           X=                  ,Y =                , H=i                       .
                 2   1  −i           2     1   i             −1        0

The Cayley transform is the automorphism of sl2 (C) given by

                                                                                  
                    πi                   πi              1             1       i
         c = exp ad    (X + Y ) = exp ad    (x + y) = Ad √
                    4                    4                2            i       1

It satisfies

                      c (X) = x, c (Y ) = y, c (H) = h.
                                             P
   Now, as remarked earlier, the root system (tC , gC ) is of type Cn . Moreover,
the various compact and non-compact root multiplicities are as follows:

                    dim k±(γi ±γj )/2 = d, dim p±(γi ±γj )/2 = d
                           dim k±γi = e, dim p±γi = 1

We fix holomorphic homomorphisms

                         Ψj : sl2 (C) −→ gC , j = 1, ..., n

such that each Ψj (X) spans pγj , and we write

                   Xj = Ψj (X), xj = Ψj (x), yj = Ψj (y),etc.

The images of Ψj commute with each other and we also write
                      X           X           X
                  X=     Xj , x =    xj , y =   yj , etc.
                           j            j            j

The Cayley transform of g is the product
                               πi                  πi
                 c = exp ad       (x + y) = exp ad    (X + Y).
                               4                   4
We write a = c (it) for the Cayley transform of it. This is the abelian subalgebra
of g spanned by h1 , · · · , hn .

1.4     The symmetric space L/H
Let H ⊂ L be the stabilizer of y ∈ n, then condition 2. implies (and is in fact
equivalent to the assertion) that L/H is a symmetric space. The involution σ
for this symmetric space consists of conjugation by a suitable element of K —
corresponding to the element w0 of condition 2.

                                         5
    Example. If G = O2n,2n , then L = GL2n (R) and N is the Jordan algebra
of 2n × 2n real skew-symmetric matrices, and H = Spn (R).
    In the present situation L/H is always non-Riemannian; and moreover a is
the corresponding Cartan subalgebra in the usual sense. In other words, if we
consider the Cartan decompositions for θ and σ

                                l = m + r , l = h + q;

then a is a Cartan subspace in q ∩ r.
   Since a = c (it), the roots of a in g are
                                                             1
               Σ(a, g) = {±εi ± εj , ±2εj } where εi =         γi ◦ c−1 .
                                                             2
Moreover it is easy to see that

 Σ(a, l) = {±(εi − εj )} , Σ(a, n) = {εi + εj , 2εj } , Σ(a, n) = {−εi − εj , −2εj } .

    We now remark that the weight

                               ν = ε1 + ε2 + . . . + εn

extends to a character of l. The easiest way to see this is to consider for a in a,
                   h      X                        X    i
       tr adn (a) = −2d       (εi + εj ) − (e + 1)   2εj (a) = −2rν (a) .

Thus we can define
                 
                  1
      ν (l) = −     tr adn (l) for l ∈ l, where r = d(n − 1) + (e + 1).
                 2r

Similarly, we define a corresponding positive character of L by
                                               −1/(2r)
                    eν (l) = lν = |det Adn l|            for l in L.

Considering an appropriate power of the determinant we obtain a corresponding
positive character of the groups P and P , which we write as g 7→ eν (g), or as
g 7→ g ν .
    To complete the connection with the Jordan structure, we note that the
Jordan norm φ on n is a polynomial function which transforms by the character
e−2ν of L. Finally we observe that the Killing form on g gives a pairing between
n and n which we rescale by setting hx1 , y1 i = 1.


2    Integral formulas
It is an immediate consequence of Corollary 5.3 that the L-orbits in n carry
equivariant measures. More precisely, we write eν for the positive character of
L defined in 1.4 and let r = d(n − 1) + (e + 1) be as before. Then we have

                                          6
Lemma 2.1    1. The Lebesgue measure dλ on n is e2rν -equivariant for the
   L-action.
  2. The rank k-orbit carries an e2dkν -equivariant measure dµ = dµk .
   The (easy) proof of this lemma is postponed to the next subsection. We
now describe a “polar coordinates” expression for these equivariant measures.
Let O be the rank k orbit, O = L · (y1 + . . . + yk ). In [Lo] it is shown that the
elements
                     {z1 y1 + . . . + zk yk | z1 > z2 > . . . > zk > 0}
give a complete set of orbit representatives for the action of M = L ∩ K on the
rank k orbit. Accordingly, we write Ck ⊂ Rk for the cone
               Ck = {z = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zk ) | z1 > z2 > . . . > zk > 0};
and for m in M , z in Ck we write
                         m · z = Ad m (z1 y1 + . . . + zk yk ) ∈ n.
   For z in Ck we introduce the notation
                                               Y                             Yk

    The main results of this section are summarized in the following two propo-
sitions.

   The scalars c appearing in the above integral formulas are independent of f
and depend only on the normalization of the measures dλ and dµ.
   For subsequent purposes we need to consider the Lebesgue measure on n as
well as n. For m in M , z in Cn , we write
                         m ◦ z = Ad m (z1 x1 + . . . + zn xn ) ∈ n .                  (1)
Since the Cartan involution θ gives a linear isomorphism between n and n,
satisfying θ (m ◦ z) = m · z, the following result can be derived immediately
from Proposition 2.2.

                                               7

   The proofs of the propositions will occupy the rest of this section.

2.1    Stabilizers and equivariant measures
In this subsection, we prove Lemma 2.1. For this we need to first determine the
stabilizer of the point y1 + . . . + yk in the rank k orbit. If k = n, the stabilizer is
the symmetric subgroup H described previously. We now discuss the remaining
orbits. To simplify notation we fix k and write

                                 y 1 = y1 + . . . + yk .

In Jordan algebra terms, y1 is a Peirce idempotent and considering the 1 and
0 Peirce-eigenspaces of y1 , we obtain smaller Jordan algebras n1 and n0 with
identity elements y1 and y0 = yk+1 + . . . + yn , respectively. The corresponding
structure groups L1 and L0 are naturally subgroups of L. Subgroups of L1 and
L0 will be distinguished by subscripts 1 and 0, respectively. For example,

            M1 = M ∩ L1 , M0 = M ∩ L0 , H1 = H ∩ L1 , a1 = a ∩ l1 .

Thus H1 is the stabilizer of y1 in L1 , and the full stabilizer of y1 in L is given
by

                                 S = (H1 × L0 ) · U ,                               (2)

where U is the abelian subgroup whose Lie algebra u is spanned by the root
spaces l−εi +εj (1 ≤ i ≤ k < j ≤ n). Then

                    l = s+ (q1 + u) , where q1 = q ∩ l1 , u = θu.

    Proof. (of Lemma 2.1) From the calculation in the previous section, it
follows that the Lebesgue measure dλ on n is equivariant by the character
                               −1
           η (l) = |det Adn l|      = e2rν (l) = l2[d(n−1)+e+1]ν for l in L,

which proves the first part of the lemma.
   For the second part, we consider the stabilizer of y1 + . . . + yk . First suppose
k = n; in this case the stabilizer H is semisimple, and hence

                           |det Adh h| = 1 for all h ∈ H.


                                            8
Since eν |H = 1 as well, it follows from Corollary 5.3 that for each real t, the
open orbit carries a measure which is etν -equivariant. The measure dµ is simply
the special case t = 2dn.
     Now suppose k < n, then s = h1 +l0 +u and it is easy to see that tr [ads (z)] =
0 for z in h1 and u. Thus we can assume that z is in l0 , and then tr [adh1 +l0 (z)] =
0, hence tr [ads (z)] = tr [adu (z)]. To calculate this, it suffices to consider z in
a0 , and then we get
                                      X
      tr [ads (z)] = tr [adu (z)] =          2d (−εi + εj ) (z)
                                   1≤i≤k<j≤n

                 = −2d (n − k) [ε1 + . . . + εk ] (z) + 2dk [εk+1 + . . . + εn ] (z) .

Now the weights ε1 , . . . , εk restrict trivially on a0 , hence we see that the required
trace is the restriction of 2dkν to s. Thus we get

                                |det Ads s| = e2dkν (s)

and the result follows by Corollary 5.3.

2.2    Jacobians for homogeneous spaces
In order to prove integral formulas for homogeneous spaces, we need a method
for calculate the Jacobian of a diffeomorphism between such spaces. It is conve-
nient to work with the more flexible notion of a local diffeomorphisms between
X and Y , by which we simply mean a diffeomorphism between open subsets of
X and Y . We also introduce the notation
                                            F
                                    (X, x) → (Y, y)

to represent the situation where X and Y are smooth manifolds; x and y are
points in X and Y ; F is a diffeomorphism from an open neighborhood of x to
an open neighborhood of Y such that F (x) = y.
    We now consider the following situation: Suppose X and Y are homogenous
spaces for groups G and H, and dx and dy are regular measures on this spaces
which are equivariant for characters γ (g) and η (h) respectively. We choose two
points x0 ∈ X and y0 ∈ Y , and fix linear bases for the tangent spaces at these
points.

Lemma 2.5 Suppose that in the above situation we have a local diffeormor-
phism F : X → Y . Then for all x in the domain of F we have

                        JF (x) = cη (h) γ (g) |det DhF g (x0 )| ,

where c is a scalar independent of x; h ∈ H and g ∈ G satisfy

                              g · x0 = x, h · F (x) = y0

and DhF g : Tx0 X → Ty0 Y is regarded as a matrix via the above bases.

                                            9
   Proof. We fix x and write y = F (x). Then we have local diffeomorphisms
                               g          F           h
                      (X, x0 ) → (X, x) → (Y, y) → (Y, y0 ) .

By formula (16) we get

           JhF g (x0 ) = Jg (x0 ) JF (x) Jh (y) = γ (g)−1 JF (x) η (h)−1 .

On the other hand by Lemma 5.1 we have

                          JhF g (x0 ) = c |det DhF g (x0 )|

for some positive scalar c, independent of hF g. The lemma follows.

2.3    Integral formula for the Lebesgue measure
We now apply the results of the previous subsections to prove the integration
formulas on the L-orbits. In order to do this we first need to fix bases for various
subspaces of l which are compatible with the actions of θ and σ. We start with
the weight decomposition
                                                     
                              l = l0 ⊕ ⊕i6=j lεi −εj

where l0 is the centralizer of a. The involutions θ and σ act by −1 on a, thus
the space l0 is invariant by θ and σ; considering their eigenvalues we have the
decomposition

                           l0 = l++ + l+− + l−+ + l−−

where l++ = l0 ∩ (m ∩ h), l+− = l0 ∩ (m ∩ q) etc. Note of course that l−− = a.
On the other hand, the root spaces lα are not stable under θ and σ, in fact each
involution maps lα to l−α . However the involution τ = σθ = θσ does stabilize
these spaces. Considering the eigenvalues of τ we have a decomposition

                                   lα = lα,+ + lα,−

where lα,+ = l ∩ (m ∩ h + r ∩ q), lα,− = lα ∩ (m ∩ q + r ∩ h) (cf. [Sc, 8.1]).
  In the present situation, we always have

                            dim lα,+ = dim lα,− = d.

This fact can be checked easily for each of the examples in the table below, from
the lists of multiplicities in [OS]. We fix bases
                           α,± 	                	
                           Xl      ⊂ lα,± , Xl±,± ⊂ l±,± .

   We now turn to the proof of Proposition 2.2. The rank n orbit L/H is open
and dense in n and its complement has measure 0. Since L/H is a symmetric
space of type An−1 , the “multiplication” map

                                F : m × a 7→ ma−1

                                         10
gives an diffeomorphism between [M/M ′ ] × A+ and L/H, where M ′ is the
centralizer of A in M ∩ H and A+ = exp a+ with

                   a+ = {c1 h1 + · · · + cn hn | c1 ≥ . . . ≥ cn }

We regard F as a local diffeomorphism between the homogeneous spaces [M/M ′ ]×
A+ = [M × A] / [M ′ × {1}] and L/H. By Corollary 5.3, the first space carries
an invariant measure dm × da, while the second space carries the Lebesgue
measure dλ which is e2rν -equivariant by Lemma 2.1. The main result is the
following Jacobian computation.

Lemma 2.6 In the above situation there is a scalar c such that
                                            Y               
           JF,dm×da,dλ (m × a) = ca2(e+1)ν      a4εi − a4εj d .
                                                    i<j


   Proof. We fix the natural base points x0 = 1 × 1 ∈ [M/M ′ ] × A and
y0 = 1 ∈ L/H and apply Lemma 2.5 from the previous subsection with

                              g = m × a, h = am−1

Then we have
                                                 
                                                 −1
      hF g m′ , a′ = hF mm′ , aa′ = h mm′ (aa′ )      = (am′ a−1 ) a′−1

Therefore the differential DhF g : m/m′ + a → l/h is given by

                      Ta (v, w) := Ad (a) v + w (mod h)                      (3)

This shows that

                     JF,dm×da,dλ (m × a) ∼ a2rν |det Ta |

for some fixed choice of bases for m/m′ + a and l/h. Since r = d(n − 1) + e + 1,
the result follows from the next lemma.

Lemma 2.7 For the map Ta defined in formula (3) we have
                                       Y            
                |det Ta | ∼ a−2d(n−1)ν  a4εi − a4εj d
                                              i<j

    Proof. In order to compute the determinant, we choose convenient bases
for l/h and m/m′ + a. We have l/h ≈ q, and so we may choose the basis
             ±,− 	  α,+                                 	
             Xk     , Xk − θXkα,+ , Xkα,− + θXkα,− | α > 0 ;

   For the space m/m′ + a, we note that m′ = l++ in our earlier notation, and
thus a basis is given by:
              ±,− 	  α,+                                  	
              Xk      , Xk + θXkα,+ , Xkα,− + θXkα,− | α > 0

                                         11
     We now claim that

                     Ta · Xk±,− = Xk±,−
                               aα − a−α                               
          Ta · Xkα,+ + θXkα,+ =                         Xkα,+ − θXkα,+       (mod h)
                                       2
               α,−        α,−    aα + a−α                             
          Ta · Xk + θXk          =                      Xkα,− + θXkα,−       (mod h)
                                       2
The first equality is obvious. For the second, we calculate
                                             
Ta · Xkα,+ + θXkα,+ = Ad (a) · Xkα,+ + θXkα,+ = aα Xkα,+ + a−α θXkα,+
                         aα − a−α  α,+             aα + a−α  α,+        
                       =            Xk − θXkα,+ +              Xk + θXkα,+
                             2                             2
                         aα − a−α  α,+        α,+ 
                       =            Xk − θXk         (mod h) .
                             2
The third equality follows by a similar calculation.
                                                              	                	
   Since there are d vectors in each of the sets Xkα,+ + θXkα,+ , Xkα,− + θXkα,−
we get

   We can now prove Proposition 2.2.
   Proof. (of Proposition 2.2) Since the map F is a diffeomorphism between
[M/M ′ ] × A+ and L/H, by the Jacobian calculation, we get

For a suitable normalization
                            of the Haar measures, the innermost integral can

we have

                          a−1 = a · y =e2c1 y1 + · · · + e2cn yn .

Thus if we identify A+ and Cn via the map

                                        i<j

Making these substitutions in the integral formula, we obtain the desired result.


2.4    Integral formula for the equivariant measure
We now turn to the proof of Proposition 2.3. For the case of the measure dµ on
the open orbit, the calculations are exactly the same as in the previous section,
the only difference being that the measure is e2dnν -equivariant. Thus arguing
as in Lemmas 2.6 and 2.7 we obtain that

Now arguing as in the proof of Proposition 2.2 we obtain Proposition 2.3 for
k = n.
     Now consider the case k ≤ n. We recall the notation y1 = y1 + . . . +
yk , M1 , M0 , etc. introduced in section 2.1. Now writing M1′ = ZM1 ∩H1 (a1 ) and
a+             +                                      1         ′
 1 = a1 ∩ a etc., we get a local diffeomorphism F : M/(M1 × M0 ) × A1 →
                                                                              +

O = L/S given by
                                  F 1 (m, a) = ma−1
Arguing as in Lemma 2.6, we obtain
                                                                   
                   JF,dm×da,dµ (m × a) ∼ a2dk(ε1 +···+εk ) det Ta1 
where Ta1 : m/ (m′1 + m0 ) + a1 → l/s is given by
                         Ta1 (v, w) = Ad a (v) + w (mod s )
and we compute the determinant for some choice of basis for the two sides. We
choose these bases in the following manner. We have A1 -module isomorphisms
                           m              m     m1
                                + a1 ≈         + ′ + a1
                       m′1 + m0        m1 + m0  m1
                                   l/s ≈ u + q1 .
Thus the map Ta1 decomposes as a direct sum Ta1 = T0 + T1 with
                                m             m1
                      T0 :           → u, T1 : ′ + a1 → q1 .
                             m1 + m0          m1
The calculation for |det T1 | is the same as in Lemma 2.7, applied to a smaller
Jordan algebra of rank k. This gives
            Y                                                    Y             
|det T1 | =     a2εi −2εj − a2εj −2εi d = a−2d(k−1)(ε1 +···+εk )   a4εi − a4εj d

                                          13
To calculate det T0 we use the following bases for m/ (m1 + m0 ) and u
               m                    

                                                        	
                  u : Xlα,± | α = εi − εj , i ≤ k, j > k

The action of T0 is given by
                          
     ad a · Xlα,± + θXlα,± = aα Xlα,± + a−α θXlα,± = aα Xlα,± (mod s)

Since for a in A1 we have aεj = 1 for j > k, we get
                            Y           
                |det T0 | =     aεi −εj 2d = a2d(n−k)(ε1 +···+εk ) .
                           i≤k,j>k

Thus we get

        JF,dm×da,dµ (m × a) ∼ a2dk(ε1 +···+εk ) |det T1 | |det T0 |
                                                          Y                
                            = a2d(n−k+1)(ε1 +···+εk )          a4εi − a4εj d .
                                                         i<j≤k

   Now arguing as in the proof of Proposition 2.2 we obtain Proposition 2.3 for
k < n.


3     Estimates for spherical vectors
We can relate the P -representation πO to a unitarizable submodule of a certain
degenerate principal series for G, which is described as follows: If χ is a character
                                                                                  G
of L, we write (πχ , I(χ)) for the degenerate principal series representation Ind P χ
(unnormalized smooth induction); thus

        I(χ) = {f ∈ C ∞ (G)|f (lng) = χ(l)f (g) for l ∈ L, n ∈ N , g ∈ G}

and the group G acts by right translations. By virtue of the Gelfand-Naimark
decomposition G ≈ P N , functions from I(χ) are determined by their restriction
to N . Combining this with the exponential map we can identify I(χ) with a
subspace E(χ) of C ∞ (n) . We refer to this as the noncompact picture.
    For t ∈ R, we write I(t), E(t) for I(etν ), E(etν ); more generally, if ε : L → T
is a unitary character, we write I(t, ε), E(t, ε) for I(etν ⊗ ε), E(etν ⊗ ε). These
principal series were studied in [S3] via the “Cayley operator” D which is the
constant coefficient differential operator on n, whose symbol is the Jordan norm
polynomial φ. Powers of D are intertwining operators for the principal series,
and their eigenvalues on the various K-isotypic components are given by the
Capelli identity of [KS].
    E(t) is a spherical representation of G and we write Φt for the K-spherical
vector. Among the results obtained in [S3] is that for

                          χk = e−dkν , k = 1, . . . , n − 1;

                                          14
the space E(−dk) contains a unitarizable spherical submodule. We need to
study the Fourier transforms of the corresponding spherical vectors

                            Φ−dk ; k = 1, . . . , n − 1.

For this we identify n with the dual of n∗ via the normalized Killing form from
subsection 1.4. Also we fix k < n, write Φ for the spherical vector Φ−dk , and
write (O, dµ) for the rank k orbit in n together with its equivariant measure
described in Lemma 2.1. The main results are

Proposition 3.1 The measure Φdλ is a tempered distribution on n and there
exists an M -invariant function g in L1 (O, dµ) such that
                                        d
                                  Φdλ = gdµ.

Proposition 3.2 For k < n, one has g ∈ L2 (O, dµ).

   We prove these propositions in the next few subsections. The strategy is
as follows: Let us write Φk,n for the function Φ−dk , in order to emphasize
dependence on n as well as k. Now although the above results are false in
general for the open orbit (k = n), nevertheless we can prove the desired results
by reducing to a slightly weaker estimate for k = n, which turns out to be true,
and somewhat easier to prove. We establish this result in the next subsection
and then outline the reduction procedure in the two following subsections. We
then deduce Theorem 0.1 from Proposition 3.2 by arguments similar to [S1] and
[DS2].

3.1    Estimates for the open orbit
As indicated above, we first consider the function

                               Φ = Φn,n = Φ−dn .

We need appropriate L2 -estimates with respect to the Lebesgue measure dλ
on n for the function Ψ and its derivatives. The “straightforward” estimate is
actually false for the group Spn (C), but it does work for the other groups G in
the table in subsection 5.3. Thus we formulate two results, one for G 6= Spn (C)
and the other for all groups:

Proposition 3.3 For all groups G other than Spn (C), we have Φ ∈ L2 (n, dλ).



Proposition 3.4 For all groups G and for all m ≥ 1, we have Dm Φ ∈ L2 (n, dλ).


   For each t, the function Φt is M -invariant, and is therefore determined by
the restriction to the subspace {z1 x1 + · · · + zn xn } ⊆ n; we start by giving an
explicit formula for the restriction.

                                        15
Lemma 3.5 We have
                                       n
                                       Y                 t
                    Φt (m ◦ z) =            (1 + zi2 ) 2 for all m in M.
                                       i=1



    Proof. For the group G = SL2 (R) this is a straightforward calculation
which we leave to the reader. In the general case, we view Φ as a function on G
which is right K-invariant, and left P -equivariant with character etν . We now
restrict Φ to the subgroup SL2 × · · · × SL2 corresponding to the S-triples of
section 1.3. This restriction is right SO2 × · · ·× SO2 -invariant, and left B × · · ·×
B-equivariant with character esν = esε1 × · · · × esεn . Thus applying the SL2 -
calculation to each factor, we conclude that the restriction to z1 x1 + · · · + zn xn
is given as in the statement of the lemma .
    Combining this with Corollary 2.4 we obtain the following estimate

Lemma 3.6 For t < − [d (n − 1) + (e + 1) /2], we have Φt ∈ L2 (n, dλ).

   Proof. Combining the previous lemma with Corollary 2.4, we get
                  Z             Z
                          2
                     |Φt | dλ =     ψ(z)dz1 dz2 . . . dzn ,
                                              Cn

where
                                n
                                Y                            Y
                     ψ(z) =           zie (1 + zi2 )t             (zi2 − zj2 )d .
                                i=1                     1≤i<j≤n


Expanding (zi2 − zj2 )d , we can write ψ(z) as a combination of terms of the form
                  n
                  Y
                        zie+ki (1 + zi2 )t where each ki ≤ 2d (n − 1) .
                  i=1

Each of these integrals is a product of one-variable integrals which converge if
                       Z ∞
                                               t
                             xe+2d(n−1) 1 + x2 dx < ∞.
                            0

This happens if 2t + e + 2d (n − 1) < −1, which proves the lemma.

Corollary 3.7 If f ∈ E(t, ε) for some t < − [d(n − 1) + (e + 1) /2] and D is
any constant coefficient differential operator, then we have Df ∈ L2 (n, dλ).

    Proof. The group G acts on I(t, ε) by right translations. The corresponding
action of the Lie algebra g in the noncompact picture E(t, ε) is by polynomial
coefficient vector fields on n. The action of x ∈ n is independent of (t, ε) and
is given simply by the directional derivative in the direction x. In particular,

                                                 16
the space E(t, ε) is invariant for the action of constant coefficient differential
operators.
    Thus f ′ ≡ Df also belongs to E(t, ε). Thus f ′ is the restriction to N of
a P -equivariant smooth function on G. Since G = P K, any such function is
determined by its restriction to K. The constant function 1 on K corresponds
to the spherical vector Φt in I(t). Thus if c is the maximum of |f ′ | on K, then
we have |f ′ | ≤ cΦt , and the corollary follows from the previous lemma.
    We can now prove Propositions 3.3 and 3.4 (for G 6= Spn (C).
    Proof. (of Propositions 3.3 and 3.4 for G 6= Spn (C)) From the table in
Section 5.3 we see that in every case except G = Spn (C), we have 2d > e + 1.
Consequently we get

                       −dn < − [d (n − 1) + (e + 1) /2] .

Proposition 3.3 now follows from Lemma 3.6, and Proposition 3.4 follows im-
mediately from Corollary 3.7 for all groups except for G = Spn (C).
    Suppose now that G is Spn (C). Then L = GLn (C) and n is the space of
n × n complex symmetric matrices. We write V for the finite-dimensional space
of holomorphic polynomials on n spanned by all the minors of the symmetric
                                                                   det l
matrix x, and let ε be the unitary character of L given by ε(l) =         .
                                                                  |det l|

Lemma 3.8 V is a Spn (C)-invariant subspace of E(1, ε).

   Proof. The character eν of L is simply |det l|. Therefore, the space I(1, ε)
consists of smooth functions on G = Spn (C) satisfying

                              f (lng) = det(l)f (g).

   An easy calculation shows that the representation of G on I(1, ε) can be
expressed in the noncompact picture E(1, ε) as follows:
                                                                
                                         −1                    a b
     g · f (x) = det(a + xc) f [a + xc] [b + xd] for g =             ∈ G.
                                                               c d
              −1                                
               a      b                     0 −1
   For p =                ∈  P  and  w =             we have
                 0   at                     1 0
                                                          
                        p · f (x) = det(a−1 ) f ab + axat
                                                   
                        w · f (x) = det(x) f −x−1

    Evidently, transformations of the form x 7−→ c + axat take minors of x to
linear combinations of (possibly smaller) minors; thus V is P -invariant.
    Also each minor of x−1 is equal to ± det(x)−1 times the complementary
minor of x; thus V is w-invariant. Since P is a maximal parabolic subgroup, w
and P generate G, and hence the space V is G-invariant.
    It remains only to prove that V ⊂ E(1, ε). Using the Gelfand-Naimark
decomposition, the functions in V can be lifted to P -equivariant functions on

                                       17
the dense open set P N in G. From the G-invariance of the finite-dimensional
space V, it follows that these functions transform finitely under right translations
by K. Therefore they extend to smooth functions on K, and hence on G. The
lemma follows.

Corollary 3.9 For G = Spn (C), the function det(x) belongs to the space E(1, ε).


   We can now finish the proof of Lemma 3.4.
   Proof. (of Lemma 3.4 for G = Spn (C)) For G = Spn (C), we have d = 1,
and the function Ψ is given explicitly by

                              Ψ(x) = det(1 + xx)−n/2

and we have

                               φ(x) = det(x) det(x)
                                 D = det(∂x ) det(∂x ).

Thus

                     DΨ = det(∂x ) det(∂x ) det(1 + xx)−n/2 .                    (4)

    To calculate this, we proceed as follows. First of all, it is well known that
for u a complex symmetric matrix

                        det(∂u ) det(u)s = const · det(u)s−1

where the constant can be calculated using, for example, the Capelli identity
from [KS].
   Making a simple change of variables, we deduce

                   det(∂u ) det(1 + u)s = const · det(1 + u)s−1 .

Now if v is a fixed n × n complex matrix, then changing variables from u to
v t uv, we get

           det(∂u ) det(1 + v t uv)s = const · det(vv t ) det(1 + v t uv)s−1 .

This can be rewritten as

           det(∂u ) det(1 + vv t u)s = const · det(vv t ) det(1 + vv t u)s−1 .

By analytic continuation, we get for all complex symmetric w

              det(∂u ) det(1 + wu)s = const · det(w) det(1 + wu)s−1 .

   Applying this to (4), we obtain

                 DΨ = const · det(∂x ) det(x) det(1 + xx)−n/2−1 .

                                           18
    The function det(1+xx)−n/2−1 is the spherical vector in E(−n−2). Also, by
the corollary above, det(x) belongs to E(1, ε). Each of these functions extends
to a smooth function on G with appropriate P -equivariance. By considering the
equivariance of the product, we deduce

                   det(x) det(1 + xx)−n/2−1 ∈ E(−n − 1, ε).

   Since Dm−1 det(∂x ) is a constant coefficient differential operator, we get
                              h                             i
  Dm Ψ = const ·Dm−1 det(∂x ) det(x) det(1 + xx)−n/2−1 ∈ E(−n − 1, ε).

Now in the present case we have d = 1, e = 1, thus we get

                   − [d (n − 1) + (e + 1) /2] = −n > −n − 1

and so the result follows from Corollary 3.7.

3.2    Proof of the L1 estimate
We fix k and denote the spherical vector Φk,n = Φ−dk by simply Φ as before.
In order to prove the necessary estimates for Φ, we first relate it to the “rank
1” spherical vector

                                Υ = Φ1,n = Φ−d .

We now describe the key result in [DS2, Theorem 0.1] concerning the function Υ.
Let τ = d−e−1
          2    and let Kτ be the corresponding one-variable K-Bessel function;
define an M -invariant function υ on the rank 1 orbit O1 = L · y1 ⊂ n ≈ n∗ by
the formula
                                      Kτ (z)
                  υ (z [m · y1 ]) =          for z ∈ R+ , m ∈ M .
                                       zτ
Then writing dµ1 for the equivariant measure on O1 , we have
                                      [1 = Υdλ
                                      υdµ

where dλ is the Lebesgue measure on n, and b denotes the Fourier transform
of tempered distributions. This result is proved in Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 of
[DS2]. For our present purposes, it is crucial that τ depends only on d and e
but does not depend on n.
    An immediate consequence of 3.5 is the relation

                                       Φ = Υk .                              (5)

This in turn implies a relation between the Fourier transforms of Φ and Υ which
we now explain. We start with the following abstract situation:
   Suppose A is a Lie group, χ is a positive character of A, and B ⊃ C are
subgroups such that each of the homogeneous spaces A/B and A/C admit χ-
equivariant measures dmA/B and dmA/C .

                                          19
Lemma 3.10 In the above situation, the space Z = B/C admits a B-invariant
measure dz. Moreover, the formula
                                     Z
                           Cf (aB) =   f (az) dz
                                                Z

gives a well-defined operator C = CA,B,C : L1 (A/C) → L1 (A/B) satisfying
                       Z                   Z
                             [Cf ] dmA/B =      f dmA/C .                 (6)
                             A/B                        A/C

     Proof. By Lemma 5.2 for b ∈ B, c ∈ C, we get

                        −1       |deta (Ad b)|        −1 |deta (Ad c)|
                  χ (b)      =                 , χ (c) =               .
                                 |detb (Ad b)|           |detc (Ad c)|

Specializing to b = c, this implies

                                      |detb (Ad c)|
                                                    =1
                                      |detc (Ad c)|

and another application of 5.2 proves the existence of an invariant measure on
B/C.
   The left side of formula (6) gives a χ-equivariant mean on the space Cc (A/C)
thus it agrees with the right side after suitable normalization of the various
measures involved. On the other hand we have
                           Z            Z
                                       
               |Cf (a)| =  f (az) dz  ≤   |f (az)| dz = C |f | (a)
                                 Z                  Z

     therefore for f in Cc (A/C) we get
             Z                   Z                   Z
                   |Cf | dmA/B ≤      C |f | dmA/B =                |f | dmA/C .
              A/B                      A/B                    A/C

  This shows that C extends to a bounded linear operator from L1 (A/C) →
 1
L (A/B) such that the formula (6) continues to hold.
  We apply the previous result to the situation where

                     A = L, B = S = stab y1 , C = S ′ = stab y′

with y1 = y1 + y2 + . . . + yk as before, and y′ = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yk ) ∈ O1 × . . . × O1 .
The space O = L/S is the rank k orbit and hence by Lemma 2.1 carries a e2dkν -
equivariant measure. On the other hand, the space O1 × . . . × O1 also carries a
e2dkν -equivariant measure, viz. dµ′ = dµ1 × . . . × dµ1 ; moreover in this situation
O′ = L/S ′ is an open subset whose complement has measure 0. Thus O′ also
admits an e2dkν -equivariant measure. Thus by the previous lemma, obtain a
well defined operator C = CL,S,S ′ : L1 (O′ ) → L1 (O) satisfying formula (6).


                                             20
   Now given a function f on O1 , we define a function f˘ on O by the following
two-step procedure: first define f on O′ by

                           f (l · y ′ ) = f (l · y1 ) · · · f (l · yk ) ,

and then set

                                            f˘ = Cf .

   Then we have the following result:

Lemma 3.11 For υ as above, put g = ῠ = Cυ, then we have

                                         d = Φdλ.
                                         gdµ

   Proof. It suffices to prove
                       Z
                             e−ihx,yi g (y) dµ (y) = Φ (x) .
                            y∈O

To show this, we rewrite the left side as
                      Z
                                                         
                         e−ihx,l·y i Cυ l · y 1 dµ l · y 1 .
                                  1
                                                                                     (7)

Now we have
                       
          
                        x, l · y 1 = hx, l · y1 i + · · · + hx, l · yk i .

Thus setting

                             η (l · y1 ) = exp (−i hx, l · y1 i) ,

formula (7) becomes
                                          Z
                                              Cηυdµ.

Now using the previous lemma, we can rewrite this as
           Z             k Z
                         Y                                              
                   ′
               ηυdµ =              f (l · yj ) η (l · yj ) dµ1 (l · yj ) = Υk = Φ.
                         j=1



    Proof. (of Proposition 3.1) In view of the previous lemma, it remains only
to prove that g ∈ L1 (O, dµ). In turn, using Lemma 3.10, it suffices to show that
υ ∈ L1 (O′ , dµ′ ), or equivalently that

                                     υ ∈ L1 (O1 , dµ1 ).


                                                21
   This is essentially contained in Proposition 2.1 of [DS2]. The key point is
that by Proposition 2.3 for k = 1, we get
                        Z           Z
                                        Kτ (z) dn−1
                            υdµ1 =            z     dz.
                         O1          R+   zτ

Since the function Kτ (z) has exponential decay at infinity, it suffices to prove
that the integral on the right converges at 0. For this we note that Kzτ τ(z) has a
pole of order 2τ = d − e − 1 at 0 if τ > 0, and a logarithmic singularity if τ = 0.
At any rate (dn − 1) − 2τ = d (n − 1) + e is greater than −1, which guarantees
the convergence of the integral.

3.3    Proof of the L2 estimate
The key to the proof of Proposition 3.2 is a “stability” result for the function g
defined in Lemma 3.11. To state this, we temporarily write gk,n and dµk,n for
g and dµ, in order to emphasize dependence on k (the rank of the orbit) and n
(the rank of the Jordan algebra). Thus Lemma 3.11 becomes

                                  \
                                gk,n dµk,n = Φk,n dλ.

    We now recall the notation n1 , n0 , L1 , M1 etc., introduced in subsection 2.1.
Thus n1 is a Jordan algebra of rank k (with same values of d and e as n). By
applying the considerations of the previous sections to n1 we obtain a family
of functions gj,k ; j = 1, ..., k, defined on the various L1 -orbits in n1 . We are
particularly interested in the function

                                         e
                                         g = gk,k

which is defined on the open orbit Oe in n1 . Now by definition we have n1 ⊂ n,
and moreover we have O   e ⊂ O, where O is the rank k orbit in n. Thus we can
                                         e The crucial “stability” result is the
restrict the function g = gk,n from O to O.
following:

Lemma 3.12 With the above notation, we have g|Oe = e
                                                   g.

    Proof. The function ge is also defined by the analogous two-step procedure
applied to the Jordan algebra n1 . We start with the M1 -invariant function υ  e
on the rank 1 orbit Oe1 ⊂ n1 corresponding to the Bessel function Kτ /z τ . As
observed after the definition υ, the parameter τ = (d − e − 1) /2 is independent
of n. Thus we get

                                                 e,
                                        υ|Oe 1 = υ                              (8)

which is the rank 1 version of the present lemma.
   Next, we consider the open L1 -orbit O  e′ in O
                                                 e1 × · · · × O
                                                              e1 , and define the
analogous function υe by the formula

                         e (l · y ′ ) = υe (l · y1 ) · · · υe (l · yk )
                         υ

                                              22
                               e′ and l in L1 . Comparing this with the definition of υ,
for y ′ = (y1 , · · · , yk ) ∈ O
and using formula (8) we deduce

                                                e
                                       υ|Oe ′ = υ

Now the functions g and ge are defined by the integrals
                                  Z
                               
                     g l · y1 =      υ (l · z) dz for l in L                        (9)
                                  ZZ
                               
                     ge l · y 1 =    e (l · ze) de
                                     υ           z for l in L1
                                      e
                                      Z

where dz and de z are the invariant measures on the homogeneous spaces Z =
S/S ′ ⊂ L/S ′ = O′ and Z e = (S ∩ L1 ) / (S ′ ∩ L1 ) ⊂ L1 / (S ′ ∩ L1 ) = O
                                                                          e′ . How-
ever, as in formula (2) we see that

                              S = ((S ∩ L1 ) × L0 ) · U,
                             S ′ = ((S ′ ∩ L1 ) × L0 ) · U .

                      e′ ⊂ O′ , we have
Thus in the imbedding O
                                              e
                                          Z = Z.

Moreover, since both measures are L1 -invariant, we have

                                       dz = de
                                             z.

Thus the two integrals in formula (9) coincide for l in L1 , and the result follows.

    Let f 7→ fˇ denote the inverse Fourier transform which maps functions on n1
to functions on n1 . Thus
                                     Z
                             ˇ
                             f (y) =    eihx,yi f (x) dλ
                                          n1

where dλ is the Lebesgue measure on n1 .

Lemma 3.13 Writing φe for the Jordan norm polynomial on n1 , we have
                             d−(e+1)            
                                       ed−(e+1) 
                (Φk,kˇ) = e
                            g φe      = e
                                           gφ        .

    Proof. The Fourier transform of tempered distributions is defined by ad-
jointness from its action on Schwartz functions, and we have the relation

                                     fď
                                       dλ = f dλ.

   Now by the definition of ge we have

                                    ged
                                      dµ = Φk,k dλ,

                                               23
where dµ is the equivariant measure on the open orbit O  e ⊂ n1 . Propositions 2.2
and 2.3 imply that in polar coordinates, the measures dλ and dµ are given by
Pke+1 Vkd d×        d d ×                                 e
           k z and Pk Vk dk z respectively. Thus, writing φ for the Jordan norm
polynomial on n1 , we get
                                       d−(e+1)
                                       
                                dµ = φe        dλ.

Combining these formulas we obtain the result.
               e be the Cayley operator on n1 then for l ≥ 0 we have
Lemma 3.14 Let D
                                               
                      el                       
                     (D Φk,kˇ) = geφel+d−(e+1)  .

   Proof. If f (x) is a Schwartz function on n1 and q(y) is a homogeneous
polynomial on n1 , then we have (up to a scalar multiple)

                                    (∂q f ˇ) = q fˇ,

where ∂q is the constant coefficient differential operator on n1 with “symbol” q.
Thus the proof of the Lemma consists in establishing that the above identity
continues to hold when f (like Φk,k ) is a smooth function of polynomial growth
such that fˇ ∈ L1 (n1 , dλ). This is fairly standard; indeed by adjointness we have
the result

                                 q[
                                  fˇdλ = ∂q (f dλ),

where the derivative on the right is the distributional derivative. Under the
assumption on f , the right side equals (∂q f ) dλ, and the result follows.
    We are now in a position to prove Proposition 3.2.
    Proof. (of Proposition 3.2) The function g is M -invariant, thus by Propo-
sition 2.3, it suffices to prove the convergence of the integral
                    Z
                                                   2         d
                        |g(z1 y1 + . . . + zk yk )| Pkn−k+1 Vk d×k z.
                      Ck

By the previous Lemma, this can be rewritten as
                Z
                                                         d
                    g(z1 y1 + . . . + zk yk )|2 Pkn−k+1 Vk d×
                   |e                                        k z.
                      Ck

Using Proposition 2.3 we can further rewrite this as
               Z         
                         
                   g |2 φet  dλ where t = d(n − k + 1) − (e + 1) .
                  |e
                 n1

   Thus it suffices to prove that
                                    
                               2 et 
                               g φ  ∈ L1 (n1 , dλ) .
                              e                                              (10)


                                          24
    Now the map f 7→ fˇ extends as an isometry from L2 (n1 , dλ) to L2 (n1 , dλ)
(after suitable normalizations of the Lebesgue measures). Thus we have

                     f1 , f2 ∈ L2 (n1 , dλ) ⇒ fˇ1 fˇ2 ∈ L1 (n1 , dλ) ;      (11)

we shall deduce (10) from (11) by a suitable choice of f1 , f2 .
   Let us put

                  s = t + 2 (e + 1 − d) = d(n − k − 1) + (e + 1) ;

since n > k, we have s > 0. Now if we set

                  f1 = D                e l2 Φk,k where l1 + l2 = s;
                       e l1 Φk,k , f2 = D                                   (12)

then by the previous lemma we have
                                     l1 +l2 −2(e+1−d)        
                    fˇ1 fˇ2  = ge2 φe                 2 et 
                                                         = e
                                                            g φ .          (13)

    We now consider two cases: if G 6= Spn (C) we set l1 = 0 and l2 = s; if G =
Spn (C), we set l1 = 1 and l2 = s − 1. In the former case we have l1 , l2 ≥ 0;
while in the latter case, we have e = 1, whence s ≥ 2 and l1 , l2 ≥ 1. Thus in
either case by the open orbit estimates of Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4, applied to the
Jordan algebra n1 , we deduce that the functions f1 and f2 from formula (12)
belong to L2 (n1 , d1 x). Thus formula (10) follows from (13) and (11).


4     Proof of the main results
We now explain how to deduce Theorems 0.1 and 0.2 from the previous results.
As explained in the introduction, the arguments are very similar to those in
[S1], [DS1] and [DS2]. Thus we shall limit ourselves to only sketching the proofs
of the various results below.

4.1     Proof of Theorem 0.1
In order to prove Theorem 0.1, we introduce a number of spaces.
    First of all, let I (−dk) ⊂ C ∞ (n) be the space of smooth vectors in the
degenerate principal series defined in section 3.The representation π = π−dkν
of the group G on this space is by “fractional linear transformations”, and we
have
                                                           
                    [π (l) f ] (x) = e−dkν (l) f Ad l−1 [x] for l in L,
               [π (exp x′ ) f ] (x) = f (x + x′ ) for x′ in n.

By [S3], the space E(−dk) has an irreducible unitarizable spherical (g, K)-
submodule V which we also regard as a subspace of C ∞ (n). Thus by Harish-
Chandra theory, the Hilbert space closure H of V with respect to the (g, K)-
invariant norm carries an irreducible unitary representation of G.

                                            25
    For convenience, we first describe H as the closure of a G-invariant space.
For this we introduce the space V consisting of those vectors in I(−dk) whose
restriction to K, and subsequent expansion in K-isotypic components only in-
volves the K-types of V. Since V is (g, K)-invariant, the space V is G-invariant
and we have the following result.

Lemma 4.1 The functions in V have finite H-norm and H is the closure of
V.

    Proof. This is a consequence of a general result due to Casselman-Wallach
on the smooth vectors of a representation. In the present situation, one can also
give an alternative proof along the lines of the remark in section 2.4 of [DS2] as
follows.
    First of all, the K-types of V have multiplicity 1, and have highest weights
of the form

                              m 1 γ1 + · · · + m k γk ,

where m1 ≥ · · · ≥ mk ≥ 0 and γ1 , · · · , γk are as in subsection 1.2. Moreover
the H-norm on each K-type is computed explicitly in [S3] and the ratio of the
H-norm to the L2 (K)-norm grows at most polynomially in (m1 , · · · , mk ). On
the other hand by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma for f in V, the L2 (K)-norms
of its K-isotypic components decay rapidly. Thus such an f will have finite
H-norm. Evidently since V ⊂ V, the closure of V is H as well.
    Next recall the space HO = L2 (O, dµ); by Mackey theory, this space carries
a natural irreducible unitary representation πO of P , which is given by the
following explicit formulas:
                                                          
                    [πO (l) ψ] (y) = edkν (l) ψ Ad l−1 [y] for l in L
              [πO (exp x) ψ] (y) = e−ihx,yi ψ (y) for x in n ,

where hx, yi is the normalized Killing form of subsection 1.4. We shall prove
Theorem 0.1 by constructing a unitary P -isomorphism I between (π|P , H) and
(πO , HO ).
   We first define I on a suitable subspace of H. For this, let C (G) be the
convolution algebra of smooth L1 functions on G. Then by standard arguments,
π extends to a representation of C (G) on V and we define

                             W = π (C (G)) Φ ⊂ V ,

where Φ = Φ−dk is the spherical vector in I (−dk). Since G = P K and Φ is
K-fixed, we also have

                                W = π (C (P )) Φ;

and we shall prove the following result:



                                         26
Lemma 4.2 For each f in W there is a unique I (f ) ∈ HO such that we have
the equality

                                  f dλ = I\
                                          (f ) dµ,

of tempered distributions. Furthermore, for all F ∈ C (P ) we have

                             I ◦ π (F ) = πO (F ) ◦ I .                         (14)

   Proof. The key step is, of course, 3.2 which shows that for the function
Φ = Φ−dk we have
                                          d
                                    Φdλ = ψdµ.

where ψ ∈ HO ; or, equivalently,
                                   Z
                          Φ(x) =           e−ihx,yi ψ(y)dµ(y).
                                       O

Now for l in L, by Lemma 2.1 we have
Z                                           Z
                                                                       
    e−ihx,yi [πO (l) ψ] (y)dµ(y) = edkν (l)     e−ihx,yi ψ Ad l−1 [y] dµ(y)
  O                                           O
                                                        Z
                                    dkν       −2dkν
                                 =e     (l) e       (l)    e−ihx,Ad l[y]i ψ(y)dµ(y)
                                                         O
                                              Z
                                                 e−ihAd l [x],yi ψ(y)dµ(y) = π (l) f
                                                          −1
                                 = e−dkν (l)
                                                   O
               ′
Similarly for x in n, we have
 Z                                        Z
                                            e−ihx+x ,yi ψ(y)dµ(y) = π (exp x′ ) f.
                                                   ′
    e−ihx,yi [πO (exp x′ ) ψ] (y) dµ(y) =
  O                                            O

   Thus for any F ∈ C (P ), we have

                          [π (F ) Φ] dλ = ([πO (F ) ψ] dµb)

and we can define I by the formula

                             I (π (F ) Φ) = πO (F ) ψ.

Then I satisfies the conditions of the lemma. The uniqueness is clear.
   We can now finish the proof of Theorem 0.1.
   Proof. (of Theorem 0.1) Given the previous lemma, the proof of the result
proceeds along lines similar to [S1] and [DS2, ]. By the previous lemma, the
space W1 = I (W) is a C (P )-invariant subspace of HO , and moreover we can
equip it with a second P -invariant norm, namely that transferred from H. Now
as explained in [S1, 3.3], it follows from [P] that W1 contains a further C (P )-
invariant subspace W2 on which the two norms coincide (up to a scalar multiple
which we normalize to be 1 by rescaling I).

                                             27
    Since HO is irreducible, W2 is dense in HO and thus HO can be regarded
as the closure of W2 with respect to the H-norm. It follows that the two norms
agree on W1 as well, and thus the map

                                   I −1 : W1 → W

extend to an isometric P -invariant imbedding J of HO into H. Now the image
of J is closed, and contains a G-invariant subspace (namely W); thus since H is
an irreducible representation, it follows that J is surjective as well. Thus J is a
unitary intertwining operator between (πO , HO ) and (π|P , H). The required ex-
tension of (πO , HO ) to G is now given by simply transferring the representation
from (π, H) via J −1 .

4.2    Proof of Theorem 0.2
We now study tensor products of our representations πO . The analogous study
for conformal groups of Euclidean Jordan algebras was conducted in [DS1].
Since the statements and proofs from [DS1] can be transferred to our present
(non-Euclidean) setting without substantial changes, we will only sketch some
of the arguments below.
    Fix s ≥ 2 and a collection of positive integers k1 , . . . , ks satisfying the con-
dition

                               k = k1 + · · · + ks ≤ n.

For each i = 1, . . . , s, let Oi be the L-orbit on n of rank ki , with L-equivariant
measure dµi . Let πOi be the unitary representation of G on the space L2 (Oi , dµi )
as described in theorem 0.1. We wish to study the tensor product representation

                                Π = πO1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ πOs

which can be realized explicitly on the space L2 (O1 × . . . × Os , dµ1 × . . . × dµs ).
   Let y1 , · · · , yn be as in subsection 1.3, and define

  vi = ymi +1 + ymi +2 + . . . + ymi +ki , where mi = k1 + . . . + ki−1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ s.

Then vi is an orbit representative for Oi ; v = v1 + · · · + vs is an orbit represen-
tative for the rank k orbit O; and the L-orbit of

                                  v ′ = (v1 , · · · , vs )

is an open subset of O1 × . . . × Os with full measure. We denote by S ′ and S
the isotropy subgroups of v ′ and v, respectively. In the notation of subsection
2.1, we have v = y1 , and thus

                                 S = (H1 × L0 ) · U .

It is easy to see that S ′ can then be written as

                                 S ′ = (H1′ × L0 ) · U ,

                                            28
where H1′ is a certain reductive subgroup of H1 . We now change the notation
slightly and write G′ for H1 and H ′ for H1′ .
    Example. Take G = E7(7) , s = 2 and k1 = 1, k2 = 2. Then k = n = 3
and S = G′ (the stabilizer of the identity element of n – the exceptional Jordan
algebra of dimension 27). In this case we have G′ = F4(4) and S ′ = H ′ = Spin4,5
(cf. [A, p. 119]).
    In general, X = G′ /H ′ is a reductive homogeneous space, and we write
    G′
IndH ′ 1 for the quasiregular representation of G′ on L2 (X). We decompose this
using the Plancherel measure dρ and the corresponding multiplicity function
m:H  b → {0, 1, 2, . . . , ∞}, i.e.,
                                           Z ⊕
                                     ′
                              IndGH′   1 ≃     m(σ)σ dρ(σ).
                                               c′
                                               G

We define a map Θ from irreducible unitary representations of G′ to unitary
representations of P defined as follows

                              Θ(σ) = IndP
                                        SN (Eσ ⊗ χv ),

where Eσ denotes the trivial extension of σ to S = (G′ × L0 ) · U , and χv is the
unitary character of N defined by

                                  χv (exp x) = e−ihv,xi .

An easy application of Mackey theory shows that all representations Θ(σ) are
unitary irreducible representations of P , and Θ(σ) ≃ Θ(σ ′ ) if and only if σ ≃ σ ′ .

Proposition 4.3 The restriction of Π to P decomposes as follows
                              Z ⊕
                      Π|P ≃       m(σ)Θ(σ) dρ(σ),                                (15)
                                          c′
                                          G

   Proof. This is proved as in [DS1, Lemma 2.1] — here is a sketch of the
argument. We define an operator F from the space of Π to functions on P by
the formula
                                    
              [F f ] (ln) = χv lnl−1 f (l · v ′ ), l ∈ L, n ∈ N.

It is an easy exercise to verify that F gives a unitary isomorphism

                               Π|P ≃ IndP
                                        S ′ N (1 ⊗ χv ).

   Next, using induction by stages we obtain an isomorphism
                                                            
                 IndP
                    S N
                      ′ (1 ⊗ χ v ) ≃ IndP
                                        SN   (IndS
                                                 S ′ 1) ⊗ χ v .


A final easy calculation shows that
                                                   Z   ⊕
                                           ′
                  IndSS ′   1≃E       IndG
                                         H′    1 ≃           m(σ) (Eσ) dρ(σ)
                                                     c′
                                                     G


                                                29
Combining the various isomorphisms, we obtain the result.
   Let κ be a unitary representation of G on a Hilbert space H, and R be a
subgroup of G. We shall write A(κ, R) for the von Neumann algebra generated
by the operators {κ(g)|g ∈ R}. If G is a type I group [M], then for irreducible
κ one has A(κ, G) = B (H) — the full algebra of bounded operators on H. To
extend the P -decomposition of Π from formula (15) to the G- decomposition,
we require the following

Proposition 4.4 A(Π, G) = A(Π, P ).

    Proposition 4.4 was proved in [DS1, 4.4] for conformal groups of Euclidean
Jordan algebras. The proof given in [DS1] combines the low rank theory of [Li1],
[Li2] for classical groups, and Jordan algebra techniques for the exceptional
groups. The arguments extend to our present setting without any significant
modifications. For the readers convenience, we outline the steps of the argument
in Appendix 5.2.
    Proof. (of Theorem 0.2) Consider the direct integral decomposition of Π
                                  Z ⊕
                              Π=      m(κ)κ dη(κ)

into irreducible representations of G. Then
               Z ⊕                       Z ⊕
    A(Π, P ) ⊆      m(κ)A(κ, P ) dη(κ) ⊆     m(κ)A(κ, G) dη(κ) = A(Π, G).

The equality of Proposition 4.4 is possible only when the following conditions
are satisfied (for almost every κ with respect to dη):

   • κ|P is irreducible (then A(κ, P ) = A(κ, G));
   • If κ|P ≃ κ′ |P , then κ ≃ κ′ .

    In other words, in this case (almost) every irreducible representation Θ(σ)
from the spectrum of Π|P extends uniquely to a certain irreducible representa-
tion of G, which we denote by θ(σ); and the P -decomposition (15) gives rise to
the G-decomposition
                                 Z ⊕
                            Π=       m(σ)θ(σ) dρ(σ)
                                      c′
                                      G

and the theorem follows.
   Example. Again, take G = E7(7) , s = 2 and k1 = 1, k2 = 2. Then the
map σ 7→ θ(σ) establishes a correspondence between the spectrum of Π and the
spectrum of the rank 1 reductive symmetric space F4(4) /Spin(4, 5). In other
words, we obtain a duality between (some subsets of) the unitary duals of two
exceptional groups: split F4 on one side and split E7 on the other side. As
with Howe’s duality correspondence (the usual θ-correspondence), we expect
that this new duality will have smooth and global analogues.

5.1    Measures and Jacobians
If F : X → Y is a diffeomorphism between manifolds and dx is a measure on
X, the pushforward of dx is the measure F∗ dx on Y defined by
                        Z              Z
                           f [F∗ dx] =   f (F (x)) dx.
                            Y             X

                                    n
If dλ is the Lebesgue measure on R and A : U → V is a diffeomorphism between
open sets in Rn , then the “change of variables” formula for the Lebesgue integral
says
                      Z                               Z
                          f (A (x)) |det DA (x)| dλ =   f dλ
                        U                              V

where DA (x) : Rn → Rn is the differential of A at x in U . In other words, we
have

                            A∗ [|det DA (x)| dλ] = dλ or

or equivalently
                                                                −1
                   A∗ dλ = gdλ where g (A (x)) = |det DA (x)|

   A measure on an open set U ⊂ Rn will be called regular if it is of the form
φdλ where φ is a smooth positive function. If A : U → V is a diffeomorphism,
then we have

            A∗ (φdλ) = ψdλ where ψ (A (x)) = φ (x) / |det DA (x)| ;

thus A∗ maps regular measures to regular measures. If dx is a measure on a
smooth manifold X and U is a coordinate open set, then the pushforward of
dx|U under the coordinate map is a measure on an open set in Rn , which we
shall call the “local expression” of dx. We shall say that dx is regular if each
of these local expressions is a regular measure in the earlier sense. It follows
from our discussion that if F : X → Y is a diffeomorphism and dx is a regular
measure on X, then F∗ dx is a regular measure on Y .
    Suppose X and Y are manifolds with regular measures dx and dy, and F :
X → Y is a diffeomorphism. The Jacobian of F is the function JF (x) =
JF,dx,dy (x) on X satisfying
                       Z             Z
                          f (y) dy = JF (x) f (F (x)) dx.

or, equivalently

                                  F∗ [JF dx] = dy


                                         31
If we have another diffeomorphism G : Y → Z, where Z is a manifold with
regular measure dz, then

                    JGF (x) = JF (x)JG (y) where y = F (x)                     (16)

If X and Y are open sets in Rn , and dx = φdλ, dy = ψdλ, then it is easy to see
that
                                       |det DF (x)| ψ (x)
                          JF,dx,dy =                      .
                                            φ (F (x))

If X and Y are smooth manifolds, then we can determine the Jacobian in
a similar manner by passing to local coordinates and using formula (16). In
particular we see that for regular measures, the Jacobian is a well-defined smooth
positive function.
    The following lemma will be quite useful in calculating Jacobians.

Lemma 5.1 Suppose X and Y are manifolds with regular measures dx and
dy; let x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , and fix linear bases for the tangent spaces Tx X, Ty Y .
                                                                               F
Then there is a positive constant c, such that for any diffeomorphism X → Y
satisfying F (x) = y, we have

                               JF (x) = c |det DF (x)|

where we regard the differential DF (x) : Tx X → Ty Y as a matrix for the above
bases.

   Proof. If X and Y are open sets in Rn , and dx = φdλ, dy = ψdλ, then

                              |det DF (x)| ψ (x)
                 JF,dx,dy =                      = c |det DF (x)| ,
                                    φ (y)

where the determinant is computed for the standard basis of Tx X = Ty Y = Rn .
If we use different bases then the scalar c is replaced by a different scalar, which
is still independent of F . Passing to local coordinates, we obtain the result in
general.
    Now suppose X is a smooth manifold with the action of a Lie group G, and
let χ be a positive multiplicative character of G. A regular measure dx is called
χ-equivariant

                          g∗ dx = χ (g) dx for all g in G.

Equivalently

                   Jg,dx,dx (x) = χ (g)−1 for all x ∈ X, g ∈ G.

For example, the Lebesgue measure dλ on Rn is equivariant by the character
     −1
|det| of the group GL (Rn ).


                                         32
   If X is a homogeneous space for G then for x in X, the tangent space Tx X
can be naturally identified with g/gx , where gx is the Lie algebra of the stabilizer
Gx of x. Moreover, for g in G we have

                           Dg = Ad g : g/gx → g/gg·x .


Lemma 5.2 A G-homogeneous space X admits a χ-equivariant measure if and
only if
                   −1               
              χ (h) = detg/gx (Ad h) for all h ∈ Gx .

    This result is well-known and can be proved in a manner analogous to The-
orem I.1.9 in [H]. Here is a quick argument for the necessity of the condition.
If h is in Gx , then we have
                                                                  
                 χ (h)−1 = Jh (x) = c |det Dh | = c detg/gx (Ad h) .

Specializing to h = 1 ∈ G, we deduce that c = 1.

Corollary 5.3 If G is reductive, then the condition of the previous lemma be-
comes

                      χ (h) = |detgx (Ad h)| for all h ∈ Gx .

5.2    Low rank representations
Let τ be a unitary representation of G. Consider its restriction to P , and its
further restriction to N . Since N is abelian, the restriction τ |N decomposes
into a direct integral of unitary characters of N . This decomposition defines a
projection valued measure on the dual space N ∗ , which we identify with n. If
this measure is supported on a single non-open orbit Or ⊂ N , we say that τ a
low-rank representation of G and write

                                   rankN τ = r.

   An element x1 is a primitive idempotent in a Jordan algebra N , and we can
consider the associated Peirce decomposition
                                              1
                      N = N (x1 , 1) + N (x1 , ) + N (x1 , 0).
                                              2
Observe that the spaces N (x1 , 1) and N (x1 , 0) are the Jordan algebras of ranks
1 and n − 1, respectively, with the respect to the Jordan structure inherited
from N.
   We will write N1 and N0 for N (x1 , 1) and N (x1 , 0), respectively. Similarly,
we write G0 for the conformal group of N0 , P0 = L0 N0 for the Siegel parabolic
subgroup of G0 , etc.
   Below are the examples of N0 and G0 for several different groups G :

                                         33
   • For G = Op+2,p+2 , we have N0 = R (rank 1 Jordan algebra), and G0 =
     GL2 (R).
   • If G = Spn,n , then G0 = Spn−1,n−1 .
   • If G = E7(7) , then N0 = R6,6 (rank 2 Jordan algebra), and G0 = O6,6 .
    • If G = E7 (C), then G0 = O12 (C).
            L               L
    Set f = ni=2 gε1 −εi ⊕ ni=2 gε1 +εi and n′ = f + n1 . Then n′ is a two-step
nilpotent subalgebra of g with the center n1 .
    Any generic unitary irreducible representation of the group N ′ is determined
by the unitary character of its center N1 . We denote by ρt the unitary irreducible
representation of N ′ which restricts to the multiple of the character χt on N1 ,
t ∈ N1∨ = N1∗ \{0}.
    Consider now a subgroup G0 N ′ of G. We can view G0 as a subgroup of a
symplectic group Sp(f) associated with the standard skew-symmetric bilinear
form on f. Hence we can use the oscillator representation of Sp(f) to extend the
representation ρt of N ′ to a representation of G0 N ′ which we denote by ρet .
    Let σ be a unitary representation of G, rankN σ = r, 0 < r < n. Without
loss of generality we may assume that σ has no N1 -fixed vectors. Then by
Mackey theory, we can write down the decomposition
                                       Z ⊕
                             σ|G0 N =
                                   ′         κt ⊗ ρet dt,
                                        N1∨

where all κt are unitary representations of G0 .
   Proceeding as in [DS1, 3.1], we verify that all of the representations κt are in
turn the low-rank representations of G0 . More precisely, we have the following

Lemma 5.4 Let σ be a low-rank representation of G, rankN σ = r, 0 < r < n.
Then for any t ∈ N1∨ the N0 -spectrum of the representation κt is supported on
a single L0 -orbit, and rankN0 κt = r − 1.

   The next technical lemma is proved exactly as in [DS1, 3.2]:

Lemma 5.5 If for all t ∈ N1∨ one has A(κt , G0 ) = A(κt , P0 ), then
              Z ⊕                 !     Z ⊕                       !
                                                                ′
         A         κt ⊗ ρet dt, G0 ⊆ A         κt ⊗ ρet dt, P0 N .
                   N1∨                        N1∨



Theorem 5.6 Let σ be a representation of G, rankN σ = r, 0 < r < n. Then

                               A(σ, G) = A(σ, P ).




                                        34
    Proof. The proof of the theorem is based on the fact that G0 and P generate
G, so it is enough to verify that A(σ, G0 ) ⊆ A(σ, P ). Since P0 N ′ is a subgroup
of P, by the Lemma above the assertion of the theorem is equivalent to the
claim that for any t ∈ N1∨

                             A(κt , G0 ) = A(κt , P0 ).

By the Lemma 5.4, all κt have rank r − 1. Proceeding in the same manner,
we reduce the statement of the theorem to that about rank 0 representations of
the certain (classical) group G00 . Since all rank 0 representations are the direct
integrals of characters, and any character of G00 is determined by its restriction
to the Siegel parabolic P00 ⊂ G00 , the theorem follows.
    We now consider the tensor product

                              Π = πO1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ πOs ,

for k = k1 + k2 + · · · + ks < n. Then Π is low-rank representation of G and
rankN Π = k. Applying the theorem above to Π, we obtain the statement of
Proposition 4.4 for k < n.
    It remains to check Proposition 4.4 for k = n. For all groups G except
Op+2,p+2 , Op+4 (C) and E7(7) , E7 (C) the statement of the proposition follows
from the results of [Li2], since all the representations form the spectrum of Π
appear in the Howe duality correspondence for appropriate stable range dual
pairs (G1 , G). For the exceptional cases listed above, the argument can be
constructed along the lines of Section 4 of [DS1].

5.3     Tables of groups and symmetric spaces
In the table below we list the various groups G arising from the Tits-Kantor-
Koecher construction for non-Euclidean Jordan algebras; together with the as-
sociated symmetric spaces K/M and L/H; and the crucial root multiplicities d

Op+4 (C), Op+2,p+2 where the rank is 2, and E7(7) , E7 (C) where the rank is 3.
