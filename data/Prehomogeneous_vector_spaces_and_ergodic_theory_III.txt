Introduction
   This is part three in this series of papers. Throughout this paper, k is a eld of
characteristic zero. In parts one and two [25], [23], we consider cases (2), (5), (6), (7)
in the Sato{Kimura classication [19]. In this part, we consider the prehomogeneous
vector space G = GL(5)  GL(3); V = ^2 k5 
 k3 . This is rather an isolated case
and that's why we consider this single case separately here. However, as far as the
relation between the theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces and ergodic theory
is concerned, this may be the most interesting case besides the situation of the
Oppenheim conjecture G = GL(n); V = Sym2 (kn ) , because it produces a family
of (irrational) cubic forms in ve variables whose values at integer points are dense
in R . This may be the family of cubic forms in the lowest number of variables we
can achieve by the theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces. We consider most of
the remaining irreducible split cases in part four.
   Oppenheim conjectured in [12] that if Q(x) is a real non-degenerate indenite
quadratic form in n  5 variables such that the ratio of at least one pair of coef-
cients is irrational, for any  > 0, there exists x 2 Zn such that 0 < jQ(x)j < .
Due to the result of Lewis [9], this is equivalent to say the set fQ(x) j x 2 Zng is
dense in R . There were many partial results including the one by Davenport with
the collaboration with others ([4], [5], [6], [2], [18]) for n  21. It was proved in the
optimum form by Margulis (see [10]) for n  3 using ergodic theory.
   We posed the question of generalizing the Oppenheim conjecture from the view-
point of prehomogeneous vector spaces in [25]. For more detailed comments, the

reader should see the introduction of [25]. Here, we briey state what we are going
to prove.
   Let H1 = SL(5); H2 = SL(3); H = H1  H2 . It is known that (G; V ) is a pre-
homogeneous vector space (see [22], [26], [25] for the denition of prehomogeneous
vector spaces). A non-constant polynomial (x) on V is called a relative invariant
polynomial if there exists a character  such that (gx) = (g)(x). Such (x)
exists for our case and is essentially unique. So we dene V ss = fx 2 V j (x) 6= 0g.
For x 2 VRss, let Hx0R+ be the connected component of 1 in classical topology of the
stabilizer HxR. We will prove that if x 2 VRss is \suciently irrational", Hx0R+HZ
is dense in HR.
   What Margulis did was to prove the above statement for the case H = SL(3); V =
Sym2 (R3 ) . Our method is based on the following theorem due to Ratner.
Theorem (0.1) (Ratner) Let G be a connected Lie group and U a connected
subgroup of G generated by unipotent elements of G. Then given any lattice  G
and x 2 G= , there exists a connected closed subgroup U  F  G such that
Ux = Fx . Moreover, F=F \ has a nite invariant measure.
   Note that in the above theorem, the denition of a lattice contains the condition
that G= has a nite volume. The rst statement was called Raghunathan's topo-
logical conjecture, and the second statement was proved by Ratner in conjunction
with Raghunathan's topological conjecture. Raghunathan's topological conjecture
was published by Dani [3] for one dimensional unipotent groups and was general-
ized to groups generated by unipotent elements by Margulis [10] (before Ratner's
proof). The proof for the general case was given by Ratner in a series of papers
[13], [14], [15], [16]. For these, there is an excellent survey article by Ratner [17].
   Note that in the above theorem, if G is an algebraic group over Q and is an
arithmetic lattice, the group F becomes an algebraic group dened over Q . For
this, the reader should see Proposition (3.2) [20, pp. 321{322]. It is also proved in
Proposition (3.2) [20, pp. 321{322] that the radical of F is a unipotent subgroup.
In [20], only one lattice is considered, but one can deduce the above statement
for any lattice commensurable with the lattice in [20] by a simple argument using
Ratner's theorem.
   We describe our result explicitly here. For any non-zero point x in a vector space,
we denote the point in the corresponding projective space determined by x by [x].
Also if S is a subspace of a vector space, we denote the point in the Grassmann
variety determined by S by [S ] also. Let V1 be a ve dimensional vector space
dened over Q . We x a rational basis fm0 ;    ; m4g for V1 . Let S be the subspace
of ^2 V1 spanned by the following three elements
                               m1 ^ m4 3m2 ^ m3 ;
                               m0 ^ m4 2m1 ^ m3 ;
                               m0 ^ m3 3m1 ^ m2 :
This space is of dimension three and therefore, determines an element [S ] in the
Grassmann Gr(3; V1)  = Gr(3; 10) of three dimensional subspaces in V1. Because of
the rational structure of V1 , Gr(3; V1) has a rational structure also.
                                          2
   Let
                Q(a) = a0 a4 14 a1a3 + 12 1 a2 ;
                                             2

                F (a) = 72a0a2 a4 + 9a1a2a3 2a32 27a0a23 27a21a4
         P
for a = 4i=0 ai mi . If we identify V1 with the space of binary quartic forms by
a ! m0 v14 +    + m4 v24, Q; F correspond to quadratic and cubic SL(2){invariant
polynomials. Also [S ] 2 Gr(3; 10) is the unique xed point of SL(2).
   If g 2 GL(V1 )R  = GL(5)R, it naturally acts on Gr(3; V1)R; P(Sym2V1 )R, and
P(Sym3 V1 )R. Note that (gQ)(a) = Q(g 1 a); (gF )(a) = F (g 1 a). Then the
following theorem is the main result of this paper.
Theorem (0.2) Suppose g[S ] 2= Gr(3; V1)Q and g[Q] 2= P(Sym2V1)Q . Then the set
of values of the cubic polynomial F (g 1a) at primitive integer points in Z5 is dense
in R .
   In x1, we consider various identications concerning tensor products of vector
spaces. If x 2 VRss, by Ratner's theorem, there exists a closed connected subgroup
Hx0R+  F  HR such that Hx0R+HZ = FHZ. In x2, we construct equivariant maps
from V ss to various H {varieties. In x3, we prove that these equivariant maps are
well dened and are non-trivial. These equivariant maps correspond to families
of such F 's with the property that if XF is the corresponding H {variety, F has
a unique xed point in XF . Part of our consideration resembles the argument in
[21]. In x4, we describe the orbit space to determine when Hx0R+ is generated by
unipotent elements. In x5, we classify all F 's as above. In x6, we prove Theorem
(0.2).
x1 Preliminaries
   We are going to do a lot of computations in x3 regarding symmetric tensor
products of vector spaces. We x various normalizations for that purpose in this
section.
   Let W be a vector space over k with a basis fe1 ;    ; eng. Let W  be the dual
space with the dual basis ff1;    ; fng. For a1;    ; ad 2 W , we dene
                                                   X
                        [a1;    ; ad]d = d1!           a(1) 
    
 a(d) ;
                                                   2Sd

where Sd is the group of permutations of f1;    ; dg. We identify Symd W with
the subspace of W 
d spanned by elements of the form [a1;    ; ad]d . Similarly, we
identify Symd W  with a subspace of (W  )
d . For a1 ;    ; ad1 ; ad1+1 ;    ; ad1 +d2 2
W , we dene
             [a1;    ; ad1 ]d1 [ad1 +1 ;    ; ad1 +d2 ]d2 = [a1;    ; ad1+d2 ]d1 +d2 :
By this product, Sym W becomes an associative algebra. Since [a1;    ; ad ]d =
a1    ad , we use this usual notation of product from now on.
   Since (W  )
d and W 
d are dual spaces of each other, there is a natural pairing
between Symd W and Symd W  . If a = a1    ad 2 Symd W; b = b1    bd 2 Symd W  ,
                                                     3
we normalize this pairing by
                                                      X
                     (a; b)d = (b; a)d = d1!                  b1(a(1))    bd (a(d) ):
                                                       2Sd

Then if i1 +    + in = d,

                             (ei11    einn ; f1i1    fnin )d = i1 ! d! in ! :

Therefore, Symd W  can be identied with the dual space of Symd W .
   The map
                   W 3 a ! id (a) = a 
 a 
    
 a 2 Symd W
is a polynomial map. So if f 2 Symd W  , f (a) = f (id (a)) is a polynomial map from
W to k and is homogeneous of degree d. We can identify     P  Symd W  with the space
of degree k forms on W by this correspondence. If a = ni=1 ai ei ,
                                      X          d!
                          id (a ) =         i1 !    in ! a1    an e1    en ;
                                                             i1       in i1       in


where the sum is over all (i1 ;    ; in ) such that i1 +    + in = d. So if f = f1i1    fnin ,
f (a) = ai11    ainn . Therefore, f corresponds to the monomial ai11    ainn .
   If G  GL(W ) is a subgroup, G acts on W  by (gf )(v) = f (g 1v) for g 2
G; f 2 W  . Whenever we consider the contragredient representation, we consider
this action.
x2 Denitions of equivariant maps
   Let G; V; H be as in the introduction. We construct H {equivariant maps from
V or V ss to various H {varieties in this section.
   Let W = k2 be the space of two dimensional column vectors. Let fe1 ; e2g be
the standard basis of W . Consider the usual action of GL(2) on W . This induces
an action of GL(2) on Symd W and Symd W  for any d. We dene new actions of
GL(2) on Sym2 W; Sym4W by g  x = (det g) 1gx; (det g) 2gx where g  x is the
new action and gx is the usual action. Note that scalar matrices act trivially and
therefore, this denes an action of PGL(2) on Sym2 W; Sym4W .
   Let V1 = Sym4 W; V2 = Sym2 W; V = ^2 V1 
 V2 and G1 = GL(V1 )                =
GL(5); G2 = GL(V2 )    = GL(3); G = G1  G2 . Then G acts on V in the usual
manner and the above action of PGL(2) denes a homomorphism PGL(2) ! G. By
Schur's lemma, this is an imbedding. In fact, Ker(PGL(2) ! G1 ) = Ker(PGL(2) !
G2 ) = f1g. So we regard PGL(2) as a subgroup of G. Let Te = Ker(G ! GL(V )).
By Schur's lemma again,
                          Te = f(tI5; t 2I3) j t 2 GL(1)g 
                                                          = GL(1):
If (tI5 ; t 2I3) 2 PGL(2), it acts trivially on V1 ; V2. So t = 1. Therefore, PGL(2) \
Te = f1g.
                                                        4
  Let l0 = e21 ; l1 = e1 e2 ; l2 = e22 and m0 = e41 ;    ; m4 = e42 . Then fl0 ; l1; l2g,
fm0 ;    ; m4g are bases of V2 ; V1 respectively.
  We dene a linear map 1 : V ! ^4 V1 
 Sym2 V2         = V1 
 Sym2 V2 by
                               X

for p1 ;    ; pN 2 ^2 V1 ; q1 ;    ; qN 2 V2. Regarding Sym2 V2 as a subspace of
V2 
 V2, we denote the element of V1 
 V2 
 V2 which corresponds to 1 (x) by
1 (x). Regarding V1 as the contragredient representation of V1 , V1 
 Sym2V1 is a
representation of G.
   The following lemma can be proved as in [19, p. 80], and the proof is left to the
reader.

   Let m0 ;    ; m4 2 ^4 V1 be elements such that mi ^ mj = ij m0 ^    ^ m4 (ij
is Kronecker's delta). Explicitly,
            m0 = m1 ^ m2 ^ m3 ^ m4 ; m1 = m0 ^ m2 ^ m3 ^ m4 ; etc.
We identify ^4 V1 with the dual space of V1 by the pairing
                                 V1  ^4 V1 3 (a; b) ! a ^ b
and choosing m0 ^    ^ m4 as the basis element of ^5 V1 . Then fm0 ;    ; m4 g can
be regarded as the dual basis of fm0 ;    ; m4g.
   Let

                       Pfa3 (x) = (x01 x24 x02x14 + x04 x12)
                       Pfa4 (x) = x01 x23 x02x13 + x03x12 :

  The quadratic polynomials Pfa0 (x);    ; Pfa4 (x) are the Pfaans of 4  4 main
minors of x if we regard x as an alternating 5  5 matrix with entries in V1 . This
                                                 5
idea was used in [24] for the case G = GL(5)  GL(4), V = ^2 k5

quintic extensions of a given ground eld.

Denition (2.6) 1 = 314 2  1 .
   1 is a map from V to Sym2 V2 . The following lemma can also be proved as in
[19, p. 80], and the proof is left to the reader.
Lemma (2.7) 1 (gx) = (det g1)4(det g2)g21 (x).
   This map 1 was also considered in [11] (using 1 also) for a dierent purpose.
We will show in x3 that the discriminant of 1 (x) is not identically zero and V ss
consists of x's such that 1 (x) is non-degenerate.
   For x 2 V , let 1 (x)(;  ) be the symmetric bilinear form on V2 associated with
1 (x). In other words,

               1(x)(;  ) = 21 (1(x)( +  ) 1 (x)() 1 (x)( ))
for ;  2 V2 .
   We dene a linear map jx : V1 
 V2 
 V2 ! Hom(V2 ; V1 
 V2 ) by
(2:8)                   jx (a 
  
  )( ) = 1 (x)(;  )a 
 
for a 2 V1 ; ; ;  2 V2 . If f 2 Hom(V2 ; V1 
 V2 ), we dene gf 2 Hom(V2; V1 
 V2 )
by
                                    (gf )() = gf (g2 1)
where we are considering the action of g on the element f (g2 1).
Lemma (2.9) jgx (g(a 
  
  )) = (det g1)4(det g2)gjx(a 
  
  ) for all a 2
V1 ; ;  2 V2 .
Proof. Let  2 V2. Then by Lemma (2.7),
        jgx (g(a 
  
  ))( ) = 1 (gx)(g2;  )g1a 
 g2
                                = (det g1)4(det g2)(g21 (x))(g2;  )g1a

                                = (det g1)4(det g2)1 (x)(; g2 1 )g1a

                                = (det g1)4(det g2)g(1 (x)(; g2 1 )a

                                = (det g1)4(det g2)g(jx(a

                                = (det g1)4(det g2)(g(jx(a 
  
  )))( ):
This proves the lemma. 

Denition (2.10) 3 (x) = jx (1(x)).
  Apparently, 3 is a map from V to Hom(V2 ; V1 
 V2 ).
Lemma (2.11) 3 (gx) = (det g1 )5(det g2)g3(x).
Proof.
                      3 (gx) = jgx (1 (gx))
                              = det g1 jgx(g1 (x))
                              = (det g1)5 (det g2 )gjx(1(x))
                              = (det g1)5 (det g2 )g3(x):
  
   By the basis fl0; l1; l2g for V2 , we can regard 3 (x) as a 3  3 matrix with entries
in V1 . Then the action of g = (g1; g2) 2 GL(V1 )  GL(3) is obtained by considering

(2:12)       2 (x) = tr(3 (x)2) 2 Sym2 V1 ; Fx = det 3 (x) 2 Sym3 V1
dene maps x ! 2 (x); Fx from V to Sym2 V1 ; Sym3 V1 .
   The following lemma is an easy corollary of Lemma (2.11).
Lemma (2.13) (1) 2(gx) = (det g1 )10(det g2)2g12 (x).
(2) Fgx(a) = (det g1)15(det g2)3 Fx (g1 1a) for all a 2 V1 .
   For later purposes, we describe how to compute 2(x); Fx. We have already
described how to compute 1 (x); 1(x) in (2.4), (2.5). Let fp0 ; p1; p2g be the dual
basis of fl0; l1; l2g. Suppose

  Note that 2i=0 ajibis is the (j; s){entry of the matrix product 1(x)1(x). So if
we regard 3 (x) as a 3  3 matrix with entries in V1 , we get the following relation

(2:14)                           3 (x) = 1(x)1(x):

   We can express any x 2 V as x = x0 
 l0 + x1 
 l1 + x2 
 l2 where x0; x1; x2 2 ^2 V1 .
Let Sx  ^2 V1 
               = k10 be the subspace spanned by x0 ; x1; x2. We will show in x3
that dim Sx = 3 if x 2 V ss. So if x 2 V ss, we dene

(2:15)                             3(x) 2 Gr(3; 10)

to be the element of the Grassmann determined by Sx . This denes a map x !
3 (x) from V ss to Gr(3; 10). The group G1 still acts on Gr(3; 10) and the following
lemma is obvious.
Lemma (2.16) 3 (gx) = g13 (x).
x3 Equivariant maps at w
   In this section, we prove that the equivariant maps we constructed in x2 are well
dened and are non-trivial by evaluating them at a point w, which we will dene
in (3.10).
   Let fl0; l1; l2g; fm0;    ; m4 g be the bases of Sym2W; Sym4 W we dened in x2.
Let fp0 ; p1; p2g be the dual basis of fl0; l1; l2g. Let h be the Lie algebra of PGL(2).
Then h is the Lie algebra of SL(2) also. We consider V as a representation of h
also. Let  be the fundamental dominant weight of h. We denote the irreducible
representation of h with highest weight d also by d. Then by considering weights,
^2 V1 = 6  2 and
(3:1)             6

                          = 8  6  4; 2

                                                  = 4  2  k;

where k is the trivial representation.
   Therefore, V contains the trivial representation precisely once.
   Note that V2   = h as an h{module. We identify Sym4W  as the space of homo-
geneous polynomials of degree four in two variables v = t ( v1 v2 ) (v corresponds
to v1 e1 + v2 e2 ). We identify a = a(v) = a0v14 +    + a4 v24 with (a0;    ; a4).

  An easy way to compute Lie algebra actions is to consider values in the ring of

Then the actions of h on V1; V2 are easy to describe and with respect to the bases
fe0 ;    ; e4g; fl0; l1; l2g, H0 ; H1; H2 map to
                                (A0 ; A00); (A1; A01); (A2; A02)
respectively.
   Since the action of g 2 PGL(2) on a(v) 2 Sym4W  is a(g 1v), the action of
H 2 h on a = a(v) is given by
                               a((1 H )v) = a(v) + (Ha)(v):
  Then easy computations show that
(3:4)                      H0 a = (0; 4a0; 3a1; 2a2; a3);
                           H1 a = ( 4a0 ; 2a1; 0; 2a3; 4a4);
                           H2 a = (a1; 2a2; 3a3; 4a4; 0):
  For a = (a0;    ; a4); b = (b0;    ; b4), we dene

(3:5)             Q(a; b) = a0b4 41 a1b3 + 16 a2 b2 14 a3b1 + a4 b0:
Then Q is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, invariant under the action of
PGL(2). This implies Q(Ha; b) is an alternating form for any H 2 h. We regard
this alternating form as an element of ^2 (Sym4 W  ) 
                                                       = ^2 Sym4 W .
Lemma (3.6)     The map H ! fH (a; b) = Q(Ha; b) is an h{homomorphism from h

                                               9
Proof. Note that the action of H 2 h on an element f (a; b) in ^2 (Sym4 W  ) is
given by (Hf )(a; b) = f (Ha; b) f (a; Hb). So if H; H 0 2 h,
                      (H 0fH )(a; b) = fH (H 0 a; b) fH (a; H 0b)
                                     = Q(HH 0 a; b) Q(Ha; H 0b)
                                     = Q(HH 0 a; b) + Q(H 0 Ha; b)
                                     = Q([H 0; H ]a; b)
                                     = f[H 0 ;H ] (a; b):
        
   This denes an h{homomorphism h ! ^2 V1 . Regarding this homomorphism as
an element of ^2 V1 
 h 
                         = ^2 V1 
 V2 = V , we get a xed point of V under the
action of PGL(2). We compute this element explicitly.
   Note that the linear map dened by

(3:7)                     H0 ! 21 v22; H1 ! v1 v2 ; H2 ! 21 v12
is an h{homomorphism.
   By (3.4),

(3:8)               Q(H0a; b) = a0b3 12 a1 b2 + 12 a2b1 a3 b0;
                    Q(H1a; b) = 4a0 b4 + 21 a1b3 12 a3b1 + 4a4b0;
                    Q(H2a; b) = a1b4 12 a2 b3 + 12 a3b2 a4 b1:
   Note that fe21 ; 2e1e2 ; e22g is the dual basis of fv12 ; v1v2 ; v22g, and (m0 ; v14)4 =
1; (m1 ; v13v2 )4 = 41 , etc. We identify ^2 V1 with the space of alternating bilinear
forms on V1 by assuming
                   m ^ m0 (a; b) = (m; a)1(m0 ; b)1 (m; b)1(m0 ; a)1
for m; m0 2 V1 ; a; b 2 V1 . So by the correspondence H ! fH ,
(3:9)                       H0 ! 4m0 ^ m3 12m1 ^ m2 ;
                            H1 ! 4m0 ^ m4 + 8m1 ^ m3 ;
                            H2 ! 4m1 ^ m4 12m2 ^ m3 :
Since fH0 ; H1; H2g corresponds to f 12 v22 ; v1v2 ; 21 v12 g and f2l2; 2l1; 2l0g is its dual
basis, this correspondence can be regarded as the element 8w where
(3:10) w = (m0 ^ m3 3m1 ^ m2 ) 
 l2 + ( m0 ^ m4 + 2m1 ^ m3 ) 
 l1
           + (m1 ^ m4 3m2 ^ m3 ) 
 l0 :
                                             10
  These considerations show the following proposition.
Proposition (3.11) The element w 2 V is xed by PGL(2).
  In [19, p. 95], instead of w, the element
         w0 = (m0 ^ m1 + m2 ^ m3 ; m1 ^ m2 + m3 ^ m4 ; m0 ^ m2 + m1 ^ m4 )
was considered (we shifted the indices in [19] because we are using indices 0;    ; 4).
However, by replacing m0 ;    ; m4 in w by m4 ; m2; m0; m1 ; m3 respectively, and
multiplying scalars to basis elements of ^2 V1 , we get the above element w0 . There-
fore, we are considering essentially the same element as in [19].
   In [19, p. 96], the Lie algebra of G0w0 =Te (G0w0 is the connected component
of the stabilizer) is computed and is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of PGL(2).
Therefore, this is the case for w also. Since we are assuming ch k = 0, this implies
G0w = PGL(2)  Te if k is algebraically closed (see [7]). For arbitrary k, we still have
the inclusion PGL(2)  Te  G0w . Since this is an isomorphism over k, we get the
following proposition
Proposition (3.12) G0w = PGL(2)  Te.
   By the basis fe0 ;    ; e4g, we regard V as the space of 5  5 alternating matrices
with entries in V2 . Then

            Pfa3 (w) = 3l1 l2; Pfa4 (w) = 3l22 :
Note that we are regarding them as elements of Sym2V2 and not Sym4 W .
   By the basis fl0; l1; l2g, we regard 1 (w) as a 3  3 matrix with entries in V1 as

(3:15)      n0 = l02 ; n1 = l12; n2 = l22; n3 = l0 l1; n4 = l1 l2; n5 = l0 l2 2 Sym2 V2 :
Then fn0 ;    ; n5g is a basis of Sym2 V2. Let n0 ;    ; n5 be elements of ^5 Sym2 V2 
                                                                                             =
Sym2 V2 such that ni ^ nj = ij n0 ^    ^ n5 . Then
                                               11

Therefore,
(3:15)                             1(w) = n1 2n5 :
   We identify Sym2 V2 with the dual space of Sym2 V2 . Then with respect to the
basis fp; p1 ; p2g, n1 ; n5 correspond to p21 ; 2p0p2 . Therefore, 1(w) = p21 4p0 p2 . We
regard 1 (w) as a 3  3 matrix as in x2. Then

   So, we get the following proposition easily.
Proposition (3.18) Let a = a0m0 +    + a4 m4 . Then
(1) 2(w)(a) = (tr(3 (w)2))(a) = 72(a0a4 14 a1a3 + 121 a22),
(2) Fw (a) = (det 3 (w))(a) = 72a0a2a4 + 9a1 a2a3 2a32 27a0a23 27a21a4 .
   By these considerations, 1 ; 2 are non-trivial maps. By (3.16), the discriminant
(x) of 1 (x) is a non-zero polynomial. By Lemma (2.7), (x) is a non-constant
polynomial. Therefore, it is a relative invariant polynomial. So we reproved that
w 2 Vkss. Since our case is known to be a regular prehomogeneous vector space,
Vkss is a single Gk {orbit if k is algebraically closed. Therefore, V ss consists of x's
such that 1(x) is non-degenerate.
   Since 2 (w) is non-degenerate, 2 (x) is non-degenerate for all x 2 V ss. Appar-
ently, three components of w are linearly independent. Therefore, 3 (x) 2 Gr(3; 10)
is well dened for all x 2 V ss also.
x4 The orbit space Gk n Vkss
  In this section, we prove that Gk n Vkss corresponds bijectively with GL(1)k 
GL(3)k {equivalence classes of ternary quadratic forms over k.
  We rst recall the relation between the orbit space Gk n Vkss and the Galois
cohomology set.
                                            12
  For any algebraic group G over k, let H1 (k; G) be the rst Galois cohomol-
ogy set. We choose the denition so that trivial classes are those of the form
fg 1g g2Gal(k=k
                 ) (g 2 Gk ) and the cocycle condition is h = h h for a continu-
                                                                      
ous map fh g2Gal(k=k
                      ) from Gal(k  =k) to Gk .
  Let (G; V ) be an arbitrary regular prehomogeneous vector space, and w 2 Vkss.
Then for any x 2 Vkss, there exists gx 2 Gk such that x = gxw. Then cx =
fgx 1gx g2Gal(k=k
                 ) determines a cohomology class in H (k; Gw ) and does not depend
                                                        1

on the choice of gx. The following theorem is due to Igusa [8].
Theorem (4.1) (Igusa) The correspondence
                 Gk n Vxss 3 x ! cx 2 Ker(H1 (k; Gw ) ! H1 (k; G))
is bijective.
   Note that Ker(H1(k; Gw ) ! H1(k; G)) is the set of elements c 2 H1(k; Gw ) which
map to the trivial class in H1(k; G). In our case, H1(k; G) is trivial. Therefore,
Gk n Vkss = H1 (k; Gw ).
   We recall the correspondence between GL(1)k  GL(3)k {equivalence classes of
ternary quadratic forms and quarternion algebras. Let V3 = Sym2 V2 . Then
GL(V2 )   = GL(3) acts on V3 in the usual manner. We let GL(1) act on V3 by
the usual multiplication. Then GL(1)  GL(3) acts on V3 . Let fl0; l1; l2g and
fp0 ; p1; p2g be as before. Let w = p21 4p0p2 , and Q the corresponding quadratic
form. It is well known (and is easy to verify) that the stabilizer of w is isomorphic
to SO(Q)  GL(1) and SO(Q)      = PGL(2).
   Therefore, (GL(1)k  GL(3)k ) n V3ssk corresponds bijectively with H1 (k; PGL(2)).
Since PGL(2) is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the associative algebra
M(2; 2), H1(k; PGL(2)) corresponds bijectively with isomorphism classes of quar-
ternion algebras. Given a ternary quadratic form, the corresponding quarternion
algebra is the Cliord algebra associated with the quadratic form.
   Now we go back to our situation. Let G; H; V be as before. We consider the
element w 2 Vkss which we dened in (3.10). We pointed out in (3.12) that G0w     =
PGL(2)  GL(1).
Proposition (4.2) The group Gw is connected.
Proof. We may assume that k is algebraically closed. Suppose g 2 Gk =Tek . The
connected component of the stabilizer of w in G=Te is isomorphic to PGL(2). The
conjugation by g induces an automorphism of PGL(2). Since there is no outer auto-
morphism of PGL(2), by changing g if necessary, we may assume that g commutes
with elements of PGL(2). Since V1 ; V2 are irreducible representations, by Schur's
lemma, g is represented by an element of the form (t1I5; t2I3 ). This element xes
w if and only if t21 t2 = 1. So g = 1 (in G=Te). 
Proposition (4.3) (1) The map 1 : V ! V3 = Sym2V1 induces a bijection
Gk n Vkss 
          = (GL(1)k  GL(3)k ) n V3ssk .
(2) If x 2 Vkss, the projections of Hx to G1 ; G2 induce isomorphisms to the images.
In particular, Hx  = SO(1(x)).
                                         13
Proof. Let c 2 H1 (k; Gw ). Then c becomes trivial in H1 (k; H ) also. Let g =
(g1; g2) 2 Hk be the element such that c is represented by fg 1g g2Gal(k=k
                                                                           ) . Then
the orbit in Vk corresponding to c is gw. By Lemma (2.7), 1(gw) = g21(w).
               ss

   Since H1 (k; Gw ) = H1 (k; PGL(2)) and the projection of PGL(2) to G2 is an
isomorphism to its image,
      H1(k; Gw ) 3 fg 1g g2Gal(k=k
                                  ) ! fg2 g2 g 2Gal(k=k

is a bijection. Note that we are considering PGL(2)  G for the rst element
and PGL(2)  G2 for the second element. Since (GL(1)k  GL(3)k ) n V3ssk    =
H1(k; PGL(2)), this proves (1).
   Note that (PGL(2)  Te) \ H = PGL(2). So Hw  = PGL(2). We already pointed
out that statement (2) holds for w in x2. Let x 2 Vkss. By Lemma (2.7), the
projection of Hx to G2 is contained in SO(1(x)). So it is enough to prove (2)
when k is algebraically closed. But then x is in the orbit of w and (2) follows
easily. 
Remark (4.4) The map 1 induces a map Gk n Vkss ! GL(3)k n V3ssk also, but this
may not be surjective. This may be regarded as the section (GL(1)k  GL(3)k ) n
V3ssk ! GL(3)k n V3ssk dened by x ! (det x) 1 x.
x5 Intermediate groups
     Let x 2 VRss. By Proposition (4.3), HxR is connected in classical topology. So
Hx0R+ = HxR. If 1(x) is denite, HxR is compact by Proposition (4.3) also. Then
HxRHZ  HR=HZ is a compact set. Therefore, an analogue of the Oppenheim
conjecture is not applicable to such points. The set of real indenite non-degenerate
ternary quadratic forms is a single GL(1)R  GL(3)R{orbit. Therefore, we only
consider x 2 GRw.
   We determine all the closed connected subgroups between Hx0R+ and HR for
all x 2 GRw for the rest of this section. This reduces to the consideration of
Lie algebras. We consider an arbitrary ground eld k of characteristic zero and
specialize to k = R in (5.10).
   We rst describe possible candidates for such subgroups. By Lemmas (2.7),
(2.13), (2.16), 1; 2; 3 are H {equivariant maps. As we pointed out at the end
of x3, 1(x) 2 Sym2 V1 ; 2 (x) 2 Sym2 V2 are non-degenerate for x 2 Gk w. So let
SO(1(x)); SO(2(x)) be the corresponding special orthogonal groups.
   In the following denition, x 2 Gk w.
Denition (5.1) (1) Hx1  GL(V1 ); Hx2  GL(V2 ) are the images of the projec-
tions of Hx to G1 ; G2 respectively.
(2) Hx3 = SO(2(x))  GL(V1).
   Note that both Hx1 ; Hx2 are isomorphic to Hx , and Hx     = PGL(2).
   Let h be the Lie algebra of PGL(2) as before. Let h1 = sl(5); h2 = sl(3) (Lie
algebras of SL(5); SL(3)). If f is a Lie algebra between h and h1  h2 , it it is an
h{module. So we rst decompose h1 ; h2 to direct sums of irreducible h{modules.

   The author used MAPLE [1] to nd U2; U3; U4 but computed (5.5), (5.6) man-
ually and checked (5.5), (5.6) by MAPLE again.
   By (5.6), U2 is spanned by elements of the form ad(A2)i B (1; 0; 0; 0; 0) (ad() is
the adjoint representation). Since

         ad(A0)B (1; 0; 0; 0; 0) = 0; ad(A1 )B (1; 0; 0; 0; 0) = 4B (1; 0; 0; 0; 0);

U2 is an irreducible sub h{module with highest weight 4.
  Other cases are similar. 

Proposition (5.7) (1) [U2; U2] = U1  U3 .
(2) [U2; U3] = U2  U4 .
(3) [U2; U4] = U3 .
(4) [U3; U3] = U1  U3 .
(5) [U3; U4] = U2  U4 .
(6) [U4; U4] = U1  U3 .
(7) [V2; V2] = V1.

Proof. We rst consider (1). Since U2 is irreducible, for any non-zero element
X 2 U2 , U2 is generated by X as an h{module. So [U2; U2] is generated by [X; U2]
as an h{module also.
   By straightforward computations,

(5:8)                  [B (0; 0; 1; 0; 0); B (b0;    ; b4)]

                          + C (0; 4b0; 85b1 ; 0; 85b3 ; 4b4; 0):

We chose B (0; 0; 1; 0; 0) because it is diagonal.
   By (5.8), [U2 ; U2]  U1  U3 . By choosing b1 = b3 = 0 in (5.8), [U2; U2] contains
a non-zero element of U3 . This implies [U2; U2] contains U3 . By choosing b1 6= 0 in
(5.8), [U2 ; U2] contains an element of the form X + X 0 where X 2 U1 is non-zero
and X 0 2 U3 . So X 2 [U2 ; U2]. This implies [U2; U2] contains U1 also. This proves
(1).
   Other cases follow from the following relations and by similar arguments. We
found these relations manually. However, it can be checked by a routine program

   Note that the Lie algebras of Hw1; Hw2 are isomorphic to sl(2). We denote
the Lie algebra of Hw3 by so(5) (more precisely so(3; 2)). Since dim so(5) = 10,
so(5) = U1  U3 by counting the dimension.
Proposition (5.9) If h  f  h1  h2 is a Lie subalgebra, h is one of the following

Proof. Let f be as above. Note that sl(3) does not contain any h{module which is
isomorphic to U3 or U4 . Suppose f  U4 . Then f  U1  U3 by Lemma (5.7)(1). So
f  U2 by Lemma (5.7)(5). Since f  U1 , f  U1  V1. Therefore, f  sl(5)  sl(2).
So f = sl(5)  sl(2) or sl(5)  sl(3).
   Suppose the projection of f to the rst factor contains U2 . Then there exists
an h{homomorphism  : U2 ! V2 such that (x; (x)) 2 f for all x 2 U2. By
Lemma (5.7)(1), the projection of f to the rst factor contains U3 . Since U3 is not
equivalent to any other factor, f contains U3 . By Lemma (5.7)(4), f  U1. Since
f  h, f  U1  V1 . If x 2 U2; y 2 U1 , (y; 0) 2 f. So [(y; 0); (x; (x))] = ([y; x]; 0) 2 f.
Since [U1; U2] = U2, f  U2. By Lemma (5.7)(2), f  U4 and it reduces to the
previous case.
   Suppose f does not contain U4 and the projection to the rst factor does not
contain U2. Suppose f  U3. By Lemma (5.7)(4), f  U1 . Therefore, f has so(5) as
the rst factor. This implies f = so(5)  sl(2) or so(5)  sl(3).
                                             17
   Suppose the projection of f to the rst factor is U1 . If f  V2 , f  V1 also.
Therefore, f = sl(2)  sl(3). Otherwise the projection of f to both factors are sl(2).
Since there is no sub h{module between h and U1  V1 , f is h or sl(2)  sl(2). 
   Now we specialize to the eld k = R .
Proposition (5.10) Let x 2 GRw and HxR  F  HR be a closed connected
subgroup. Then F is one of the following subgroups.
         HxR; Hx1R  Hx2R; Hx1R  SL(3)R;
         Hx3R  Hx2R; Hx3R  SL(3)R; SL(5)R  Hx2R; SL(5)R  SL(3)R:
Proof. If x = gw for g 2 GR, HxR = gHwRg 1, etc. So we may assume that x = w.
Then this proposition follows from the previous proposition. 
x6 An analogue of the Oppenheim conjecture
   In this section, we prove an analogue of the Oppenheim conjecture.
   In the following lemma, x 2 VCss. We dene Hx1C , etc. as in Denition (5.1).
Lemma (6.1) (1) If y 2 VC is xed by HxC , y is a scalar multiple of x.
(2) If y 2 Gr(3; 10)C is xed by Hx1C , y = 3(x).
(3) If y 2 Sym2 V2 is xed by Hx2C , y is a scalar multiple of 1 (x).
(4) If y 2 Sym2 V1 is xed by Hx3C , y is a scalar multiple of 2 (x).
Proof. Consider (1). Let x = gw with g 2 GC . Then HxC = gHwC g 1, and g 1y
is xed by HwC . So we may assume x = w. By (3.1), V contains the trivial
representation of h precisely once. Therefore, the set of xed points of HwC is of
dimension one. This proves (1).
   Next consider (2). Let x = gw with g = (g1; g2) 2 GC again. Let S  ^2 V1C
be the three dimensional subspace corresponding to y. Then g 1S = g1 1S is xed
by g1 1Hx1C g1 = Hw1C . Note that G2 acts trivially on Gr(3; 10). So g1 1S is HwC {
invariant also. Therefore, g1 1S is a sub hC {module. However, ^2 V1C  = 6  2.
So there is only one three dimensional sub hC {module. Since Sw also satises this
condition, y = g1[Sw ] = 3 (x).
   Statements (3), (4) are well known and were used in the proof of the Oppenheim
conjecture for quadratic forms. 
   In the following theorem, let x 2 GRw. Then Hx0R+ is generated by unipotent
elements. Let HxR  F  HR be the closed connected subgroup such that HxRHZ =
FHZ. By Ratner's theorem, such F exists.
Theorem (6.2) (1) If 2 (x) 2= P(Sym2 V1 )Q and 3(x) 2= Gr(3; 10)Q , F = SL(5)R 
Hx2R or F = SL(5)R  SL(3)R.
(2) If 1(x) 2= P(Sym2 V2 )Q , 2 (x) 2= P(Sym2 V1 )Q , and 3 (x) 2= Gr(3; 10)Q , F =
SL(5)R  SL(3)R.
Proof. Suppose F = HxR. Then F is dened over Q . Therefore, for any  2
Aut(C =Q ), HxC = HxC . Since HxC = Hx C , x is xed by HxC . So x is a scalar
multiple of x by Lemma (6.1). Since this is the case for all , [x] 2 P(V )Q . Since
1 ; 2; 3 are dened over Q , 1 (x); 2(x); 3(x) are all Q {rational points.
                                          18
   Suppose F = Hx1R  Hx2R, or Hx1R  SL(3)R. We show that 3 (x) 2 Gr(3; 10)Q .
Since the argument is similar, we only consider the rst case.
   For any  2 Aut(C =Q ),
                  Hx1C  Hx2C = Hx 1C  Hx 2C = Hx1C  Hx2C :
Since G2 acts trivially on Gr(3; 10), 3 (x ) is xed by Hx1C . This implies 3(x ) =
3 (x). Since 3 is dened over Q , 3(x ) = 3 (x) = 3 (x) by Lemma (6.1).
Therefore, 3 (x) 2 Gr(3; 10)Q .
   By a similar argument, if F = Hx1R  Hx2R; H3R  Hx2R, or SL(5)R  Hx2R,
[1(x)] 2 P(Sym2 V2 )Q . Also if F = Hx3R  Hx2R or Hx3R  SL(3)R, [2 (x)] 2
P(Sym2 V1 )Q .
   By these considerations, conditions in (1), (2) force F to become the given
subgroups. 
Lemma (6.3) Let x 2 GRw. Then for any non-zero real number r, there exists
h 2 HR and a primitive integer point a 2 V1Z such that Fh 1x (a) = r.
Proof. We may assume x = w where  2 R n f0g. Since Fh 1 w (a) = 60  Fw (ha),
the above condition is equivalent to Fw (ha) =        60   r. Put t = 
                                                                      1
                                                                                         ( ) . Then
                                                                                     20 r 3
                                                                                        2

and a = t ( 0 0 1 0 0 ) satisfy the condition. 
    In the following theorem, x 2 GRw.
Theorem (6.4) If [2 (x)] 2= P(Sym2 V1 )Q , and 3(x) 2= Gr(3; 10)Q , the set of
values of the cubic form Fx (a) at primitive integer points is dense in R .
Proof. Let r be a non-zero real number. We choose h = (h0 ; h00 ) 2 HR and a 2 V1Z
as in Lemma (6.3). By Theorem (6.2), there exist h1 = (h01; h001 ) 2 HxR and h2 =
(h02 ; h002 ) 2 HZ such that h01 h02 is close to h0 . Then
               Fx (h02 a) = Fh2 1x (a) = Fh2 1 h1 1x (a) = F(h02      1 h0 ;1)x
                                                                         1
                                                                                  (a )
is close to
                            F(h0 1 ;1)x (a) = Fh 1x (a) = r:
Note that Fh 1x does not depend on the second component of h.
  Since h02 a 2 V1Z is primitive, this proves the theorem. 
  Note that if x = gw with g = (g1; g2) 2 GR,
   3(x) = g13(w); [2(x)] = g1[2 (w)]; Fx (a) = (det g1)15(det g2)3Fw (g1 1a):
Therefore, writing down Fw , etc. explicitly, we get the statement of Theorem (0.2).
