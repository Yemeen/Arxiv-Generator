                                                         Let A be a k-algebra and G be a group acting on A. We show that

                                                     there is a monomorphism of rings HH • (A)G ֒→ HH • (A[G]). That
                                                     allows us to show the existence of a monomorphism from HH • (A) eG

                                             1       Introduction
                                             The Hochschild cohomology groups were introduced by Hochschild fifty years ago,
                                             but they have been investigated lately under different aspects by many authors.
                                                 In this work our interest is to study the Hochschild cohomology of skew group
                                             rings and of certain Koszul algebras. Our main purpose is comparing the Hochschild
                                             cohomology algebra HH • (A) = ⊕i≥0 ExtiAe (A, A) of a k-algebra A with the Hochschild
                                             cohomology algebra HH • (A[G]) of the skew group algebra A[G], with G being a
                                                 This work was done during the visit of the second author at the Universidade de São

finite group acting on A. We obtain the following relation between these cohomol-
ogy algebras.
     Theorem 2.9. Let A be a k-algebra and G be a finite group acting on A.
Then G acts on the Hochschild cohomology k-algebra HH • (A), and there is a ring
monomorphism: HH • (A)G ֒→ HH • (A[G]).
     For finite groups, it is known that there is a strong connection between skew
group rings and Galois coverings, and between skew group rings and smash prod-
ucts of graded algebras (see [6]). These facts and the existence of the monomor-
phism in Theorem above lead us to investigate a possible relation between the
Hochschild cohomology algebras of G-graded algebras and their covering algebras
defined by G. In this direction, let A be a G-graded algebra, with G being a finite
group. We consider the covering algebra of A defined by G and we relate it with
the smash product A#kG∗ . Then, as a consequence of Theorem 2.9 and using
Theorem of duality coactions, we obtain that G is a group of automorphism of A     e
and the existence of a ring monomorhism from HH (A)    • e into HH (A).

     While we were reviewing the final version of this article we received from C.
Cibils and M.J. Redondo a pre-print entiltled Cartan-Leray spectral sequence for
Galois coverings of categories, [5]. In this pre-print they gave a spectral sequence
involving the Hochschild cohomology of Galois coverings and they show that the
monomorphism obtained by us is an isomorphism in case the characteristic of the
field is zero.
     In this work we also study the Hochschild cohomology groups of Koszul alge-
bras of finite global dimension. With this we reach the Hochschild cohomology
groups of C-preprojective algebras associated to Euclidean diagrams and of Aus-
lander algebra of standard algebras, since these algebras are examples of Koszul
algebras of global dimension two. We obtain a lower bound for dimension of
HH n (A), for A be a Koszul algebra of global dimension n. So as consequence
we get that the second Hochschild cohomology group of C-preprojective algebra
of Euclidean type does not vanish; and it is also true for Auslander algebra of
standard algebras having non projective indecomposable modules isomorphic to
their own Auslander-Reiten translate. So, in both these cases the algebras are not
rigid (see [9])
     We now describe the contents of each section in the paper. In section 2, after
recalling some notions and known facts needed along the work, we state and prove
the main result of the section - Theorem 2.9. This theorem states that if a group G
is a group acting on an algebra A, then G also acts on the Hochschild cohomology
algebra of A and there is a ring monomorphism between the fixed points of the
Hochschild cohomology algebra of A and the Hochschild cohomology algebra of
the skew group ring A[G].
     In section 3 we define the covering algebra Ae associated to a G-graded algebra


                                         2
A, where G is finite group. We also recall the notion of smash product, and we
show that this product is isomorphic to that covering algebra. This isomorphism
together with Theorem 2.9 and duality coactions gives us a similar relationship
between the invariants of Hochschild cohomology ring HH • (A)  e and the Hochschild
cohomology ring of A.
    In section 4 we deal with quadratic algebras. We construct the Koszul complex
for quotient of path algebras by quadratic ideals through a similar procedure used
by Berger in [2]. The Koszul complex (named bimodule Koszul complex by him)
was constructed in [2] for quotient of free associative algebras A and it is minimal
graded resolution of A as A−A bimodule, in case A is a generalized Koszul algebra
(also called d-Koszul algebras). But it can be also constructed for algebras which
are quotient of quiver algebras by ideals generated by elements of degree d ≥ 2
(see [11]). Our construction here follows closely the one in [11] for Koszul algebras
(that is, 2-Koszul). It enables us to obtain a lower bound for the dimension of
the n-Hochschild cohomology group of Koszul algebras of global dimensional n,
and in consequence the property mentioned above for preprojective algebras of
Euclidean-type and Auslander algebra of an algebra A standard.


2     Hochschild cohomology rings and invariants
Given a ring A we denote by Aop its opposite ring. For a ∈ A we denote by
ao ∈ Aop the corresponding element in Aop . In case that A is an algebra over
a field k we will denote by Ae its enveloping algebra A ⊗k Aop . Moreover, if A
and B are algebras over k, the algebra A ⊗k B will be denoted simply by A ⊗ B.
Sometimes, by simplicity, we will not explicit the ground ring of tensor product
when it is clear in the context.
    We also remark that the category of left modules over the algebra Ae is canon-
ically isomorphic to the category of A − A bimodules. So we use this isomorphism
as identification.
    Now we recall some definitions and basic facts.

DEFINITION 2.1 Let A be a ring and G a group. We say that G acts on
A if there is a group homomorphism between G and the group Aut(A) of ring
automorphism of A. If this group homomorphism is injective, we say that G acts
faithfully on A or that G is a group of automorphism of A.

    We remark that if G acts on A, then G naturally also acts on the opposite ring
Aop . In case that A is a k-algebra, we will assume that the group Aut(A) is the
group of automorphisms of k-algebras. Moreover, if G and H are groups acting


                                         3
on the k-algebras A and B, respectively, then the group G × H acts on A ⊗k B,
and consequently G × G acts on A ⊗ Aop .
   Now we are going to recall the definition of skew group algebra.

DEFINITION 2.2 Let A be a ring and G a finite group acting on A. The
elements of the skew group ring A[G] are the same as those of the corresponding
group ring. Addition is as usual coordinate-wise, and multiplication is extended by
bilinearity from the formula (ag)(bh) = ag(b)gh, for a and b in A and g and h in
G.

   The following statements will be useful later and their verification are routine.

PROPOSITION 2.3 Let A be a k-algebra and G be a finite group acting on A.
Then,

   i) The rings (A[G])op and         Aop [G]   are   isomorphic,    via   the   map
      θ((ag)o ) = (g−1 (a))o g−1 .

  ii) A[G] ⊗k (A[G])op is isomorphic to (A ⊗k Aop )[G × G], via the map
      ψ(ag ⊗ (bh)o ) = a ⊗ (h−1 (b))o (g, h−1 ).

     Now we are going to describe certain approach on the category of the left
A-modules and the category of the left A[G]-modules, where G is a finite group
acting on the algebra A. This approach will be very useful for the next sections.
     Denoting by Mod-A the category of the left A-modules, for each g ∈ G, we can
associate a functor, denoted by g (), on Mod-A. This functor associates to each M
in Mod-A the module g M defined as follows: g M = M as an abelian group (or k-
vector space, in case A is a k-algebra) and for a ∈ A and m ∈ M , a ·g m := g(a)m.
On the morphism, g () is defined as the identity. Observe that the functor g () is
clearly an exact functor and is an automorphism of Mod-A. We also observe that
it is possible to define in a similar faction an automorphism ()g on the category
A-Mod of the right A-modules. Furthermore, analogously we could be consider a
functor g () on the category of A − A bimodules, by considering g M = M as an
A − A bimodule where it has on the left the structure as above and on the right
the original structure of MA (also in a similar way we could have M g as a A − A
bimodule).
     The following facts can be verify easily.

PROPOSITION 2.4 Let A be a ring and G a group acting on A. If g and h
are in G and M is a left A-module, then:

   i) g (h M ) =   hgM ;



                                        4
  ii) (M g )h = M gh ;
                   −1
         = Ag ∼
 iii) Ag ∼    = gA (as A − A bimodules).

   Now we recall some basic facts related to A[G]-modules (see [16])

PROPOSITION 2.5 Let A be a ring and G a finite group acting on A. If M
is in Mod-A[G], then the map g Ψ : M →gM given by g Ψ(m) = g(m) defines an
isomorphism of A-modules.

Proof.    Clearly g Ψ preserves the sum. Let a ∈ A and m ∈ M . So, we have
g Ψ(am) = g(am) = g(a)g(m) = a · g(m) = a · g Ψ(m), what shows that g Ψ
                                      g         g
is a homomorphism of A-modules. A similar verification shows that the map
       −1
m → g (m) is the A-morphism inverse of g Ψ.                             

PROPOSITION 2.6 (Lemma 4 in [16]) Let A be a k-algebra and G a finite
group acting on A. Let M and N be A[G]-modules. Then the following statements
hold:

i) The abelian group HomA (M, N ) is a kG-module, with the action (g ∗ f )(m) =
     g(f (g−1 (m)). Denote by HomA (M, N )G the set of fixed points, then
     HomA (M, N )G = HomA[G] (M, N );

ii) For all i ≥ 1, there is a natural action of G on ExtiA (M, N ) and it verifies
      that ExtiA[G] (M, N ) = ExtiA (M, N )G . If g ∈ G, ξ ∈ ExtiA (M, N ) and η ∈
      ExtjA (M, N ), then g(ξη) = g(ξ)g(η).

Proof.
   i) It is easy and well known (see for instance [16]).
                             −1
   ii) Let g ∈ G. Since g () is an exact functor, then a given element ξ ∈
                                     −1            −1    −1
ExtiA (M, N ) is taken to an element g ξ ∈ ExtiA (g M, g N ). But, since M and N
                                                −1
are A[G]-modules, by using the isomorphism g Ψ and its inverse (see Proposition
2.5) we get an exact sequence, denoted by g(ξ), which is an element in ExtiA (M, N ).
We note that if two exact sequences are representives of the same element in
ExtiA (M, N ), then their correspondents under g(−) have the same property. Hence
it indicates how to define the action. Proposition 2.4 guarantees that it really
defines an action of G on ExtiA (M, N ).
                                                                  −1
    The rest of the proof follows from the fact that the functor g () also preserves
the A-projective modules and we leave the details to the reader.                  
Note: We note that statement ii) in the last proposition could also be proved by re-
marking that A[G] is a projective A-module, and applying the functor HomA (−, N )

                                          5
to the projective resolution of M as an A[G]-module, and observing that the ho-
mology obtained at each step is a kG-module.
    Now we are going to recall the definition of Hochschild cohomology. We present
it closely to the original approach given by Hochschild and it can be found, for
instance, in [1, 4, 13, 20].

DEFINITION 2.7 Let A be an algebra over a commutative ring R, and A XA be
an A-bimodule. The ith -Hochschild cohomology group of A with coefficients in X,
denoted by HH i (A, X), is the ith cohomology group of the following complex:

       d                  d                                          d
0 → X →0 HomR (A, X) →1 HomR (A⊗2 , X) · · · HomR (A⊗n , X) →
                                                            n
                                                              HomR (A⊗n+1 , X) · · ·

where, for n ≥ 1 and f ∈ HomR (A⊗n , X), dn is defined by


    dn (f )(x1 ⊗ x2 . . . ⊗ xn+1 ) = x1 f (x2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xn+1 )
                                     Xn
                                   +     (−1)i f (x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xi xi+1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xn+1 )
                                       i=1
                                   + (−1)n+1 f (x1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ xn )xn+1

and for x ∈ X and a ∈ A, (d0 x)(a) = ax − xa.

    In case that R = k is a field, a different way of approaching to Hochschild
cohomology groups is to consider the enveloping algebra Ae = A ⊗k Aop . In this
case HH i (A, X) = ExtiAe (A, X), for all i ≥ 0. But our particular interest is the
example X = A, whose HH i (A, A) is simply denoted by HH i (A), for i ≥ 0.
These groups are used to define the Hochschild cohomology algebra HH • (A) =
⊕i≥0 HH i (A) = ⊕i≥0 ExtiAe (A, A) with the multiplication induced by the Yoneda
product. In this way HH • (A) is a Z-graded algebra (see for instance [1, 20]).
    The facts which we state next point up how important they are to stablish the
main result of this section: to relate the Hochschild cohomology algebras HH • (A)
and HH • (A[G]).
    Let A be a k-algebra and G be a finite group acting on A. We have seen, in
Proposition 2.3, the enveloping algebra A[G]e of the skew group algebra A[G] is
isomorphic to the k-algebra Ae [G×G]. We shall use this isomorphism together with
Proposition 2.6 for describing an action of G × G on the Hochschild cohomology
algebra HH • (A[G]), which respects its Z-grading (meaning the action takes an
element in HH i (A[G]) to an element in HH i (A[G]).
    With this in mind, we recall that HH • (A) = ⊕i≥0 ExtiAe (A, A) and HH • (A[G]) =
⊕i≥0 ExtiA[G]e (A[G], A[G]). We also recall that A[G] is a Ae [G × G]-module, with

                                             6
                                                 P                P
the following “ multiplications ”: (x ⊗ y o )( g∈G ag g) =           g∈G xag g(y)g, and
        P             P                −1
(σ, τ )( g∈G ag g) =     g∈G σ(ag )σgτ    , for x, y, ag in A, and σ, τ in G. Then
from Proposition 2.6, for each i ≥ 0, follows that G × G acts on ExtiAe (A[G], A[G])
and ExtiA[G]e (A[G], A[G]) ∼
                                                    G×G
                           = (ExtiAe (A[G], A[G])       . So, from the action of G × G
on the grading we get the one wanted on HH (A[G]).•

     For obtaining the relationship between the Hochschild cohomology algebras of
A and of A[G], now we describe a bit more in details the action considered above
(the one considered in Proposition 2.6) just for the cases i = 0 and i = 1, since for
i ≥ 2 the procedures are analogous
                              `       to the one i = 1.
     First we write A[G] =       Ag, as an Ae - module (or A − A bimodule), and
                             g∈G
                                                         `
so we get HH i (A[G]) = ExtiA[G]e (A[G], A[G]) ∼ =             ExtiAe (Ag, Ah), for each
                                                      (g,h)∈G×G
i ≥ 0.
     1. The action in case i = 0
     For each g, h in G, let f(g,h) ∈ HomAe (Ag, Ah) and (σ, τ ) ∈ G × G. Then we
consider the element (σ, τ )(f(g,h) ) ∈ HomAe (Aσgτ −1 , Aσhτ −1 ) defined by
(σ, τ )(f(g,h) )(aσgτ −1 ) = aσf (g)τ −1 , with a ∈ A.       `
     Clearly it defines an action on HomAe (A[G], A[G]) =           HomAe (Ag, Ah)
                                                               (g,h)∈G×G
and it is the action considered in Proposition 2.6.i).
   2. The action in case i = 1.
   Let ξ(g,h) : 0 → Ah → L → Ag → 0 be a representative of an element in
                                                                           (σ−1 , τ−1 )
Ext1Ae (Ag, Ah) and (σ, τ ) ∈ G × G. By applying the exact functor                        () to this
                                                (σ−1 , τ−1 )   e
exact sequence and using the isomorphism             Ah →          Aσhτ −1
                                                                      we obtain the
                                          1       −1        −1
element, denoted by (σ, τ )(ξ(g,h) ) ∈ ExtAe (Aσgτ , Aσhτ ). It is easy to verify

that it really defines an action on            Ext1Ae (Ag, Ah), and it is the action

mentioned in Proposition 2.6.ii).

Remark 2.8 We observe, in particular, that the subspace                   ExtiAe (Ag, Ag) of
                                                                    g∈G
ExtiAe (A[G], A[G]) under the action of G × G is taken to itself.
    On the other hand we also note that, for each i ≥ 0 and g ∈ G, ExtiAe (A, A) is
canonically isomorphic to ExtiAe (Ag, Ag) (see 2.4.iii). So, with this identification,
we can consider an action of G on HH i (A) = ExtiAe (A, A) such as the one given
by the following: for each g ∈ G and ξ ∈ HH i (A), g · ξ := (g, g)(ξ). Consequently,
we obtain that G acts on HH • (A).

    Now we can show the main result of this section which gives a relation between
the Hochschild cohomology algebras of A and A[G].

THEOREM 2.9 Let A be a k-algebra and G be a finite group acting on A.
Then G acts on the Hochschild cohomology k-algebra HH • (A), and there is a ring
monomorphism: HH • (A)G ֒→ HH • (A[G]).
Proof.                   `
   First we write A[G] =   Ag. Then we remark again that the action of G × G
                             g∈G
on HH i (A[G]) (i ≥ 0) enables having HH i (A[G]) ∼= (ExtiAe (A[G], A[G]))G×G ∼
                                                                              =
    `        i           G×G
(         ExtAe (Ag, Ah))    . So, it suggests us to identifying an element ξ ∈
 (g,h)∈G×G
ExtiAe (A[G], A[G])with a matrix ξ = (ξ(g,h) )g,h , with ξ(g,h) ∈ ExtiAe (Ag, Ah).
    Now we also remark that HH i (A) = ExtiAe (A, A) ∼     = ExtiAe (Ag, Ag), for any
g ∈ G. So, according to Remark 2.8, G acts on HH i (A), and consequently on
HH • (A), as it was indicated there.
    Therefore the morphism we are looking for can be`defined as: for each i ≥ 0,
given ξ ∈ HH i (A)G we take the element θ i (ξ) ∈                ExtiAe (Ag, Ah) whose
                                                             (g,h)∈G×G
matrix representation   θi   =   (θ i (ξ)(g,h) )g,his such that:
                                                  
                                                    0 if g 6= h
                                 θ i (ξ)(g,h)   =
                                                    ξ if g = h.
Since ξ ∈ (HH i (A))G , then, by construction, θ i (ξ) is invariant under the action
of G × G, and therefore the map θ i : HH i (A)G → HH i (A[G]) is defined; and
it is not difficult to verify that θ : HH • (A)G → HH • A[G], with θ = ⊕i θ i is a
monomorphism of rings.                                                             


3     Galois covering and Hochschild cohomology.
In this section we are going to apply the main theorem of the last section (Theorem
2.9) to show that also there is a ring monomorphism from HH • (A)    e G into HH • (A),
where A e is the covering algebra of a G-graded k-algebra A.
    In [6] it was proven that, for a k-algebra A graded by a finite group G, the smash
product A#kG∗ plays the role for graded rings that the skew group algebra A[G]
plays for group actions. So, in order to obtain the new pretended monomorphism
we shall use the notion of smash product A#(kG)∗ , for showing the existence of
an isomorphism between this product and the covering algebra of A defined by G
and we apply the duality Theorem 3.5 in [6].
    We recall here the definition of covering algebra associated to a graded algebra.
This definition was introduced in a preliminary version of [12], and it can be found
in [15]. The definition of covering algebra coincides with the one given by Green
in [10] for quotient of path algebras of quivers.

DEFINITION 3.1 Let G be a finite group and A =                     Ag be a G-graded k-

algebra, with Ag indicating the k-subspace of the homogeneous elements of degree g.
The covering k-algebra associated to A, with respect to the given grading, denoted
    e is defined as follows. As k- vector space
by A,
e=       `                     e h] = Ag−1 h , and the multiplication is defined in
A              Ã[g, h], where A[g,
     (g,h)∈G×G
                          e h] and γ ′ ∈
the following way: if γ ∈ A[g,                 e ′ , h′ ]. The product is in A[g,
                                               A[g                           e h′ ] and
it is defined by:                 
                               ′    0          if g′ 6= h
                             γγ =
                                    γγ ′       if g′ = h.

Remark 3.2 We observe that G acts freely on A,  e where the action of an element
                                            e
σ ∈ G consists in to take an element in A[g, h] to the same element, but now
                              e
considered as an element in A[σg,  σh]. Moreover the canonical vector space epi-
               e
morphism F : A → A which takes A[g, e h] to Ag−1 h , is such that F σ = F , for all
σ ∈ G, and the orbit space is A. So A  e is a Galois covering defined by G in the
sense of Gabriel and others,([3, 17]).

    Now we review the definition of smash product and some facts related to it
(see [6]).

is , for any g ∈ G and x = h∈G ah h ∈ k[G], pg (x) = ag ∈ k, and pg ph = δg,h ph ,

vector space A⊗k k[G]∗ with the multiplication given by (a#pg )(b#ph ) = abgh−1 #ph
(here a#pg denotes the element a ⊗ pg ).

    The next proposition was first proved by Green, Marcos and Solberg in a

we can define the following map Ψ : A#k[G]∗ −→ A e by

a corresponding action on the smash product A#kG∗ , which is given by g(a#ph ) =
a#phg ; and it coincides with the one defined in Lemma 3.3 in [6].
     With these remarks, as a consequence of Theorem 2.9, of the isomorphism
above and the duality coactions of Cohen-Montgomery (Th.3.5 in [6]) we obtain
the following proposition.

PROPOSITION 3.5 Let G be a finite group and A be a G-graded k-algebra.
Let Ae be the covering algebra defined by the grading. Then G acts on HH • (A)

                                            •  e G
there is a ring monomorphism from (HH (A)) into HH (A)      •


Proof. As we have seen, in Remark 3.2, G acts on A    e as a group of automorphisms.
Then, on the one side, from Theorem 2.9 it follows that G also acts on HH • (A)     e
                                                •    G          •  e
and there is a monomorphism from from HH (Ã) to HH ((A)[G]). But, on the
other side, by Proposition 3.4, Ã and A#kG∗ are isomorphic, and according to our
remark above this isomorphism leads G to act on the smash product A#G. So, by
applying the duality theorem for coactions (Th. 3.5 in [6]), we get that (A#kG∗ )[G]
is isomorphic to the matrix ring M|G| (A) where |G| denotes the order of the group
G. Since Hochschild cohomology is an invariant by Morita equivalence (in reality
                                                                              e
is an invariant of derived equivalence, [19, 20]), then it follows that HH • (A[G]) is
                    •
isomorphic to HH (A), and the proposition is proved.                                


4     The Hochschild cohomology of Koszul algebras
In this section we discuss some facts related to the Hochschild cohomology of
Koszul algebras. In particular the ones concerning to the preprojective algebras of
Euclidean-type and to Auslander algebras of standard algebras, which are Koszul
algebras.
    In order to study the Hochschild cohomology of Koszul algebras of finite global
dimension we introduce the construction of Koszul complex for quadratic algebras.
We are using a similar procedure as was done in [2] and [11] for generalized Koszul
algebras (or d- Koszul algebras). According to our comments in the introduction
of this article, we use it for 2-Koszul algebra or simply Koszul algebras. So we
review some definitions and fix some notations.
    Let k be a field and Q be a finite quiver Q. We denote by kQ the path algebra
of Q and we indicate by kQ0 the k-subalgebra whose underlying vector space is
the subspace generated by the vertex set Q0 of Q. If Qi is the set of paths of
length i, then we denotes kQi the subspace of kQ generated by Qi . It is worth to

                                         10
note that this subspace is a kQ0 bimodule. In this way, we will consider the path
algebra kQ = ⊕i≥0 kQi as a graded algebra with the grading given by the length
of the paths.
     Let A = kQ/I where Q is a finite quiver and I is a two side ideal of kQ
generated by a set of quadratic relations (the k-algebra A is called a quadratic
algebra). Denoting by R the set of homogeneous elements of degree two in I that
it is viewed as a kQ0 sub-bimodule contained
                                      T        in kQ2 .
     For each n ≥ 2, we define Kn = r+s+2=n kQr .R.kQs . Now we consider the
following Ae -modules: Qi = 0, if i < 0; Q0 = A ⊗kQ0 A; Q1 = A ⊗kQ0 kQ1 ⊗kQ0 A,
and, for n ≥ 2, Qn = A ⊗kQ0 Kn ⊗kQ0 A.
     It is clear that each Qi is an Ae -module finitely generated and projective.
Observe also that each Qi is a submodule of A ⊗kQ0 kQi ⊗kQ0 A, since Ki is
contained in kQi , for i ≥ 2.
     Now we construct, for each n ≥ 2, the following Ae -morphisms
fn : A ⊗kQ0 kQn ⊗kQ0 A → A ⊗kQ0 kQn−1 ⊗kQ0 A given by the formula


    fn (a ⊗ α1 · · · αn ⊗ b) = aα1 ⊗ α2 · · · αn ⊗ b + (−1)n a ⊗ α1 · · · αn−1 ⊗ αn b.
DEFINITION 4.1 Let A = kQ/I and Qi be the Ae -modules as above. Let
di : Qi → Qi−1 be the maps such that di = O, for i ≤ 0; d1 (1 ⊗kQ0 α ⊗kQ0 1) =
α ⊗kQ0 1 − 1 ⊗kQ0 α, with α ∈ Q1 , and, for n ≥ 2, dn is the restriction of fn to
Qn . It is very easy to see that d ◦ d = 0. Then the complex K ∗ (A) = ((Qi )i , (di )i )
is called the Koszul complex of A.
   With the definition of Koszul complex on the hands, we can utilize it for
characterizing the Koszul algebras. In order to get it we take the augmented
Koszul complex of A:
               d         dn−1             d       d′
     · · · → Qn →n
                   Qn−1 → · · · → Q1 →1 Q0 →0 A → 0 where dn , n > 0, is as in
K ∗ (A) and d′0 (a ⊗kQ0 b) = ab
THEOREM 4.2 [2, 11] Let A = kQ/I be a quadratic algebra. The augmented
                            d         dn−1             d       d′

only if A is a Koszul algebra.
    In case A = kQ/I is a Koszul algebra, the augmented Koszul complex of A is
a minimal graded projective resolution of A as Ae -module. Furthermore, if I is an
admissible ideal, then this resolution is also a minimal projective resolution of A
in Ae -mod.
    The augmented Koszul complex can be used to determine a lower bound for
dimension of HH n (A), when A is a Koszul algebra of global dimension n. It is
obtained in the corollary below.

                                             11
COROLLARY 4.3 Let A = KQ/I be a Koszul algebra of global dimension n.
For each vertex v ∈ Q0 , ev denotes the associated idempotent of A. Then
                                               a
                     dimk (HH n (A)) ≥ dimk (      (ev Kn ev ))

Proof. Since A is a Koszul algebra and has the global dimension equal n, by
Theorem 4.2 we have, using the notations fixed above, that the long exact sequence
          d                    d      d         d′
0 → Qn → n
            Qn−1 · · · → Q2 →2 Q1 →1 Q0 →o A → 0 is a graded projective resolution
of A in Ae -mod. Then the Hochschild cohomology of A can be computed as the
cohomology groups of the complex:
                                1     d∗
         0 → HomAe (A ⊗A0 A, A) → HomAe (A ⊗A0 kQ1 ⊗A0 A, A) → · · · →

 ` On the other hand, it is easy to verify that∼HomA (A⊗A0 A, A) = HomA0 (A0 , A) =
                                                    e                  e

    ev Aev , HomAe (A ⊗A0 kQ1 ⊗A0 A, A) = HomAe0 (kQ1 , A), and, for j ≥ 2,
v∈Q0
HomAe (A ⊗A0 Kj ⊗A0 A, A) ∼   = HomAe0 (Kj , A). Hence the last complex is iso-
morphic to the following one:

       a             d∗
                     1                                        d∗n

       v∈Q0

where we also are denoting by d∗i the induced maps by the isomorphisms mentioned
above.
    We observe that the vector space Hom(A0 )e (Kj , A), for j ≥ 2, can be naturally
graded by the induced grading of A; that is, we say that a map f is homogeneous of
degree t if its image is contained in homogeneous component of degree t of A. So,
it easy to see that the last complex is a complex of graded vector spaces and that
the image of each d∗j is contained in the direct sum of the homogeneous subspaces
of degree bigger than zero. Then, for j ≥ 2, the             ∗
                                            ∼  ` image of dj does not intersect the
degree zero component (HomAe0 (Kj , A))0 = v∈Q0 (ev Kj ev ) `  of HomAe0 (Kj , A). In
particular, the degree zero component (HomAe0 (Kn , A))0 ∼  = v∈Q0 (ev Kn ev ) does
                             ∗               n              ∗
not intersect the image of dn and since HH (A) = Coker dn , a simple computation
of dimensions shows our statement.                                                 
    Among the Koszul algebras we are going to point out the C-preprojective
algebras of Euclidean type and the Auslander algebra of a standard, representation

finite-type k- algebra. We will see that these algebras are Koszul algebras and as
consequence of it, via Corollary 4.3, we get interesting datum for HH 2 (A).
     First let us review the definition of preprojective algebras.

DEFINITION 4.4 Let Q be a finite quiver and k a field. Consider the quiver Q̂
whose vertex set Q̂0 = Q0 and the arrows set Q̂1 = Q1 ∪ Qop   1 , where Q
                                                                          op denotes

the opposite quiver of Q. For each arrow α ∈ Q1 we write α̂ for the corresponding
arrow in the opposite quiver. The preprojective k-algebra associated to Q (or briefly
the preprojective k-algebra of Q), denoted P
                                           by P(Q), is isPthe k-algebra kQ̂/I, where
I is the ideal generated by the relations     αα̂ and       αα̂.
                                         α∈Q1          α∈Q1


    We remark that it is well-known that the preprojective algebra constructed
as above only depends on the underlying graph of the quiver Q; that is, quivers
having the same underlying graph define isomorphic preprojective algebras.
    The Hochschild cohomology of preprojective algebras associated to Dynkin
diagrams An were studied in [8].
    We mention the following result about preprojective C-algebras associated to
Euclidean diagrams (see [7, 14, 18]).

THEOREM 4.5 The preprojective C-algebras associated to an Euclidean dia-
gram are Morita equivalent to the skew group algebras C[x, y][G], with G a poly-
hedral group.

    So this theorem can be used in order to study some properties of the prepro-
jective C-algebra of Euclidean-type through properties of certain skew group rings.
For instance, from this theorem we obtain that a preprojective C-algebra associated
to Euclidean diagrams have global dimension 2 (recall that gldim(C[x, y][G]) =
gldim(C[x, y]) = 2). Moreover, since the preprojective algebras are always quadratic
algebras, then we also get that preprojective C-algebras of Euclidean-type are
Koszul algebras.
    In this point of view we obtain as a consequence of Corollary 4.3, the following
fact about the second Hochschild cohomology group of preprojective C-algebras of
Euclidean-type.

COROLLARY 4.6 Let A be a preprojective C-algebra associated to an Euclidean
diagram. Then HH 2 (A) 6= 0

Proof. We have that A = CQ̂/I where Q is an Euclidean diagram. As we have
commented above A is a Koszul algebra of global dimension two. Since ev K2 ev is
not zero, for any vertex v, the statement follows from the corollary 4.3.     

                                         13
    We note that Theorem 4.5 can be used this to describe the centre of prepro-
jective C-algebras of Euclidean-type, once their centres are the ones of the skew
group rings C[x, y][G], for suitable groups G. Then it seems interesting to study
the Hochschild cohomology of the skew group ring, in particular its centre. In
order for studying it the following lemma will be useful.

LEMMA 4.7 Let R be a commutative ring and G be a group acting on R. Let
g be an element in G and suppose that there is α ∈ R such that α − g(α) is not a
zero divisor in R. Then HomRe (R, Rg) = 0.

Proof. Let f ∈ HomRe (R, Rg). Then αf (1) = f (1).α = f (1)g(α) = g(α)f (1),
and it implies that (α − g(α))f (1) = 0. Since α − g(α) is not a zero divisor in R,
it follows that f (1) = 0, and consequently f = 0.                               
     Now we be able to describe the center of a skew group ring.

PROPOSITION 4.8 Let R be a commutative domain and G be a finite group
of automorphism of R. Then Center(R[G]) is isomorphic to RG .

Proof.
    First we observe that HomRe (Rg, Rh) ∼   = HomRe (R, Rhg−1 ), for any g, h in G.
So, since G acts faithfully on R and R is a domain, by Lemma 4.7 we obtain that
HomRe (Rg, Rh) = 0, for any`   g 6= h in G.
    Now, if we write R[G] =       Rg as Re -module, then we have that Center(R[G]) =
                            g∈G
HH 0 (R[G]) = HomR[G]e (R[G], R[G])  = (HomRe (R[G], R[G]))G×G                    =
   `                           `
(        HomRe (Rg, Rh))G×G ∼
                            =(   HomRe (Rg, Rg))G×G .
(g,h)∈G×G                           g∈G

  `Recalling the action defined in section 2 and Remark 2.8 we have that
(   HomRe (Rg, Rg))G×G ∼= (HomRe (R, R))G ∼= RG , and the statement is proved.
g∈G
                                                                                  
    We remark that the proof of Proposition 4.8 could be obtained by a direct
computation, but we have optioned by the proof above for illustrating how to use
our methods.
    For the next corollary we need some additional terminology. We are going to
consider the Auslander algebra associated to a k-algebra of representation finite
type. So, we recall the definition of Auslander algebras.
    Let A be a k-algebra of representation finite type (i.e. up to isomorphism there
exist only finitely many indecomposable A-modules). Let X1 , X2 , · · · Xm be a list
of representatives from the isomorphism classes of indecomposable A-modules and
let X = ⊕i Xi . The k-algebra Λ = EndA (X) is called Auslander algebra of A.
Recall that A is said to be standard if Λ is isomorphic to the quotient of the path

                                          14
algebra kΓA of the Auslander-Reiten quiver ΓA of A by the ideal generated by the
mesh relations.
    We denote by mod-A the category of finitely generated left A-modules, by
ind A the subcategory of mod-A with one representative of each isoclass of inde-
composable A-module and by τA the Auslander-Reiten translate DTr.

COROLLARY 4.9 Let A be a standard representation-finite type k-algebra and
Λ be its Auslander algebra. Then dimk HH 2 (Λ) ≥ #{M ∈ ind A : τA M = M }

Proof. It is known that the Auslander algebra Λ of a representation-finite algebra
A has global dimension two. Moreover, since A is standard, we have that Λ ∼        =
kΓA /I, where ΓA is the Auslander-Reiten quiver of A and I is the ideal generated
by the mesh relations (so quadratic relations). Hence Γ is a Koszul algebra.
    By construction of the quiver ΓA and by the conditions on I, it is clear that the
number of elements of the set {M ∈ ind A : τA M ) = M } is the dimension of the
degree
  ` zero component of Homk(ΓA )0 (K2 , Λ). But that component is isomorphic
                                       e

to v∈(ΓA )0 ev K2 ev , and therefore the result follows from corollary 4.3         
