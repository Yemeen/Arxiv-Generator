                                                     Abstract. We make a fine study of the SO(2, C)-double coset decomposition
                                                     in SL(2, C) and give a full description of the intersection of the various cells

                                                     is proved and applications to analytically continued spherical functions are
                                                     given.




                                                                                 1. Introduction
                                                With a Riemannian symmetric space X = G/K of the non-compact type comes
                                             a natural complexification Ξ, the so-called complex crown of X. One can define Ξ
                                             in various ways. To begin with let G = N AK be an Iwasawa decomposition and let
                                             a = Lie(A) be the Lie algebra of A. Studying proper G-actions on XC = GC /KC
                                             Akhiezer and Gindikin were led to the following definition (cf. [1])

                                             (1.1)                            Ξ = G exp(iΩ)KC /KC ,
                                             where Ω ⊆ a is a certain bounded convex set (cf. Section 2). Observe that Ξ is a G-
                                             invariant domain in XC containing X. Moreover, the definition of Ξ is independent
                                             from the choice of a and hence Ξ is generically defined through X.
                                                Equivalently, one can define Ξ by
                                                                                                
                                                                              \
                                             (1.2)                     Ξ=        gNC AC KC /KC  ,
                                                                                  g∈G
                                                                                                           0
                                             where (·)0 refers to the connected component of (·) containing X (cf. [3, 9, 13],
                                             [2, 11], [4, 10, 12] and [15, 17]). Using the complex convexity theorem from [6] one
                                             can significantly improve on 1.2, namely
                                                                                                     
                                                                              \
                                             (1.3)                    Ξ=        gNC A exp(iΩ)KC /KC  .
                                                                              g∈G
                                                                                                                0
                                                The various definitions of Ξ are useful. In [14], where the foundations for the G-
                                             invariant complex geometry of Ξ were laid out (construction of natural G-invariant
                                             psh exhaustion functions, Kähler metrics etc.), one mainly used the description
                                             (1.1). For other purposes such as analytic continuation of eigenfunctions or the
                                             heat kernel on X to holomorphic functions on Ξ (cf. [13], [14]) the characterizations
                                             in (1.2) and in particular (1.3) are more appropriate.

    One of the main objectives in the study of complex crowns is to achieve a better
understanding of harmonic analyis on symmetric spaces. For example it was shown
in [5] that all non-compactly causal symmetric spaces G/H associated to G appear
in the so-called distinguished boundary of Ξ. Subsequently this was used in [7, 8] to
construct a Hardy-space for non-compactly causal symmetric spaces G/H yielding
first progress towards a geometric realization of some of the continuous series in
L2 (G/H) (Gelfand-Gindikin program).
    The motivation for this article stems from our interest to obtain a first under-
standing of the various kinds of weighted Bergman-spaces which can be associated
with Ξ, most notably Fock-spaces which play a prominent role in the context of the
heat kernel transform on X (cf. [14]). Intimately related to this circle of problems
is the growth behavior of analytically continued spherical functions.
    A spherical function φλ on X is left K-invariant, hence its analytic continuation
φ̃λ to Ξ is necessarily (locally) KC -invariant. This suggests that one should study
the relation of Ξ with the complexified polar decomposition ΞP = KC AC KC /KC
in XC .
    Whereas the complex crown Ξ is contained in the complexified Iwasawa decom-
position NC AC KC /KC (cf. (1.2)), the same does not hold for the complexified polar
decomposition, i.e., Ξ 6⊆ ΞP . Furthermore, the polar domain ΞP is not even open in
XC . These are disappointing facts. But before giving up, we at least wanted to un-
derstand what actually goes “wrong” in the most important case of G = SL(2, R).
It turned out that the above mentioned difficulties can be overcome, and, moreover,
by settling the technical problems we could make new observations regarding the
structure theory of complex crowns.
   This paper focuses mostly on G = SL(2, R), but we made an effort to present
results in a fashion which allows immediate generalization to all semisimple Lie
groups. An approach in full generality will be given elsewhere.
   Let us now describe some of our results in more detail. First observe that the
polar domain ΞP contains a Zariski open subset of XC ; in particular it is dense in
XC . Thus almost all elements in Ξ are contained in ΞP . Our main observation is
the following non-linear convexity theorem:
Theorem 4.1. Let G = SL(2, R) and x = g exp(iY )KC ∈ Ξ ∩ ΞP with g ∈ G and
Y ∈ Ω (cf. (1.1)). Then
                           x ∈ KC A exp(iconv(WY ))KC
with conv(WY ) the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of Y .
  We conjecture that Theorem 4.1 holds true for all semisimple Lie groups and we
provide additional evidence with a discussion of the Lorentz groups G = SOe (1, n).
   Using general results of [13] one obtains from Theorem 4.1 the following estimate:
Theorem 5.2. Let G = SL(2, R). Let φλ be a positive definite spherical function
on X and φ̃λ its analytic continuation to Ξ. Then φ̃λ is bounded.

  Finally, as an application of our methods we give an estimate for the AC -
projection in ΞP for elements in Ξ.
  It is our pleasure to thank the referee for his very careful reading and his useful
suggestions. In particular the easy proof of Theorem 3.3 is due to him.

                         2. Notation and general facts
   Let g be a real semisimple Lie algebra and g = k + p a Cartan decomposition.
For a maximal abelian subspace a of p let Σ = Σ(g, a) ⊆ a∗ be the corresponding
restricted root system. Then g admits a root space decomposition
                                            M
                               g=a⊕m⊕          gα ,
                                                α∈Σ

where m = zk (a) and gα = {X ∈ g : (∀H L  ∈ a) [H, X] = α(H)X} .
For a fixed positive system Σ+ define n := α∈Σ+ gα . Then we have the Iwasawa
decomposition on the Lie algebra level:
                                       g = k ⊕ a ⊕ n.
We write W = NK (a)/ZK (a) for the corresponding Weyl group. For an element
X ∈ a we denote by conv(WX) the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of X.

For any real Lie algebra l we write lC for its complexification.

   In the sequel GC will denote a simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra gC .
We write G, K, KC , A, AC , N and NC the analytic subgroups of GC corresponding
to subalgebras g, k, kC , a, aC , n and nC , respectively.

The following bounded and convex subset of a plays a central role:
                                            π
                    Ω := {X ∈ a : |α(X)| <      ∀ α ∈ Σ}.
                                            2

With Ω we define a left G and right KC -invariant domain in GC by
                                  Ξ̃ = G exp(iΩ)KC .
Also we write
                                        Ξ = Ξ̃/KC
for the union of right KC -cosets of Ξ̃ in the complex symmetric space GC /KC . We
refer to Ξ as the complex crown of the symmetric space G/K. Notice that Ξ is
independent of the choice of a and hence generically defined through G/K.
   As every root α ∈ Σ is analytically integral, it gives rise to a character of AC by
                        ξα : AC −→ C∗ , ξα (exp(X)) = eα(X) .


Let us define the set of regular elements in AC by
                      AC,reg = {z ∈ AC : ξα2 (z) 6= 1   ∀ α ∈ Σ}.
Notice that AC,reg is an algebraic variety ( principal open set in AC ).

  We also define
                                AC,sing = AC \AC,reg
and call it the singular set in AC .
Lemma 2.1. The following assertions hold:

     (1) The multiplication mapping
                m : KC × AC,reg × KC −→ GC , (k1 , a, k2 ) 7→ k1 ak2 ,
         is submersive. In particular, KC AC,reg KC ⊆ GC is open.
     (2) KC AC,reg KC is dense in GC .
Proof. (1) is a standard computation which will not be repeated here.
(2) Notice that KC AC,reg KC ⊆ GC is a constructible set as the image under the
regular mapping m : KC × AC,reg × KC −→ GC . Thus it follows from (1) that
KC AC,reg KC contains a Zariski-open subset of GC . This proves (2).         

Remark 2.2. Notice that the KC -bi-invariant domain KC AC KC is not open in GC
(cf. our discussion of G = SL(2, R) in Section 3).

                 3. The structure of the double KC -cosets
   In this section we will give a detailed analysis of the double KC -coset decomposi-
tion for GC = SL(2, C). Further we will start the investigation of the intersections
of Ξ̃ with the various cells in the double KC -coset decomposition.
   Let us introduce the necessary notation. Our choice of a maximal compact
subgroup of G is K = SO(2, R) and our choice of a will be
                                                      
                                      t 0
                             a=                 : t∈R .
                                      0 −t
We choose Σ+ such that
                                                            

                              n=                       : x∈R       .
                                         0     0
Notice that GC = SL(2, C) is simply connected and KC = SO(2, C).
  In order to study KC -double cosets the use of spherical functions is useful.
Definition 3.1. On GC = SL(2, C) we define the elementary spherical function Φ
by
                   Φ : GC −→ C, Φ(g) := tr(gg t ) ∀ g ∈ GC .
                  
             a b
( For g =             we have Φ(g) = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 . )
              c d
   Note that the function Φ is holomorphic and KC -bi-invariant.
    The set of singular elements in AC is given by
                                                                       

                  AC,sing =                        : z ∈ {−i, i, −1, 1}       .
                                   0    z −1
    Let g ∈ GC \ KC AC KC . According to Lemma 2.1 we can find sequences
             (kn ) ⊂ KC , (an ) ⊂ AC , (k̃n ) ⊂ KC        with kn an k̃n −→ g.
Proposition 3.2. Let g ∈ GC \ KC AC KC be the limit of the sequence (kn an k̃n ) ⊂
KC AC KC . Then (an ) ⊂ AC is bounded and for every convergent subsequence (ank )
we have
                               lim ank ∈ AC,sing .
                                   k→∞

                         zn     0
Proof. Write an =                         . By continuity of the map Φ we get
                          0    zn−1
                 Φ(g) = tr(gg t ) = lim tr(an atn ) = lim (zn2 + zn−2 ).
                                      n→∞                   n→∞
It follows that there exist m, M > 0 such that
                              0 < m < |zn | < M < ∞ ∀n.
Passing to an appropriate subsequence we can assume that zn −→ z0 6= 0.

Suppose (kn ) has a convergent subsequence. W.l.o.g. we may assume that
                         kn −→ k0 ∈ KC ,          an −→ a0 ∈ AC .
But then k̃n =   a−1 −1
                  n kn (kn an k̃n )       also converges.
We have now
               kn −→ k0 ∈ KC ,        an −→ a0 ∈ AC ,        k̃n −→ k̃0 ∈ KC .
But this would imply g = limn→∞ kn an k̃n ∈ KC AC KC , contradicting the assump-
tion.
By the same argument we see that (k̃n ) cannot have a convergent subsequence.

We want to know more about the limits z0 .
Notice that kn a2n knt converges in GC . For simplicity we omit the indices writing
k = kn and a = an . We look at the elements ka2 k t ∈ GC /KC .
Due to the KC -bi-invariance of KC AC KC and the compactness of K we can assume

We know that z → z0 and |t| → ∞.
The upper left entry in (3.1) must converge, therefore

But this implies z02 = z0−2 , hence z02 = ±1.                                       

We can now describe how GC decomposes into a disjoint union of KC -bi-invariant
subsets. Furthermore, we will give a complete description of the intersection of
Ξ̃ = G exp(iΩ)KC with the lower dimensional cells. The intersection of Ξ̃ with the
big cell KC AC KC will be subject of the next section.



Theorem 3.3.            (1) The KC -double coset decomposition of GC is given by:
                               ′              ′                 ′                ′
    GC =    KC A′C KC   ∐ P − K C ∐ P + K C ∐ P − y0 K C ∐ P + y0 K C ∐ K C .
    (2) The following equality holds:
                            Ξ̃ \ KC AC KC = P 1− KC ∐ P 1+ KC .
                                                     2              2


   In order to prove Theorem 3.3 it is useful to adopt a more geometric point of
view. We closely follow the suggestions of the referee.
   In the sequel we realize X = SL(2, R)/SO(2, R) as the upper sheet of the two-
sheeted hyperboloid
                 x20 − x21 − x22 = 1, x0 > 0             (x = (x0 , x1 , x2 ) ∈ R3 )
and XC = SL(2, C)/SO(2, C) as the complex quadric
                        z02 − z12 − z22 = 1       (z = (z0 , z1 , z2 ) ∈ C3 ).
Let e0 = (1, 0, 0). Then the polar decomposition in X is given by X = KA.e0 ,
                   x0 = cosh t, x1 = sinh t cos φ, x2 = sinh t sin φ
with t, ϕ ∈ R.

Proof. (T hm.3.3) Complexifying the real polar decomposition of X it follows that
a point z ∈ XC belongs to KC AC .e0 if and only if there exist a, b, u, v ∈ C with
                                   a2 + b2 = 1,      u2 − v 2 = 1,
such that
                            z0 = u, z1 = va, z2 = vb.
Therefore XC \ KC AC .e0 decomposes into four KC -orbits
                            (1)        z0 = 1, z1 = τ, z2 = iτ,
                            (2)        z0 = 1, z1 = τ, z2 = −iτ,
                            (3)        z0 = −1, z1 = τ, z2 = iτ,
                            (4)        z0 = −1, z1 = τ, z2 = −iτ,

where τ ∈ C∗ .
                                                                         ′        ′
The orbits (1), (2), (3), (4) correspond to the KC -bi-invariant sets P − KC , P + KC ,
   ′           ′
P − y0 KC , P + y0 KC , respectively.
This proves part (1) of the theorem.

The points z = x + iy ∈ Ξ ⊂ XC are characterized by the property
                              x0 > 0,          x20 − x21 − x22 > 0.
For an element z = (1, τ, iτ ) in the orbit (1) this translates to |τ | < 1. Therefore,
        {(1, τ, iτ ) ∈ XC : τ ∈ C∗ } ∩ Ξ = {(1, τ, iτ ) ∈ XC : τ ∈ C∗ , |τ | < 1} ,
and this subset of Ξ corresponds to P 1− KC ⊂ Ξ̃.
                                               2

Similarly one relates orbit (2) with P 1+ KC ⊂ Ξ̃.
                                               2

The intersections of both orbits (3) and (4) with Ξ̃ are empty.                              

Remark 3.4. (a) Theorem 3.3(1) can be deduced from general results of Matsuki
(cf. [16]).
(b) The cells in the decomposition of GC in Theorem 3.3 are characterized by the
                                                                 ′         ′
values of Φ. The function Φ attains the value 2 on KC and on P − KC ∐ P + KC ,

the value −2 on P y0 KC ∐ P y0 KC , and Φ can take any value except 2 on
KC A′C KC .

                      4. A non-linear convexity theorem
  In this section we will investigate the intersection of Ξ̃ with the big cell KC AC KC .
An element g ∈ G exp(iΩ)KC ∩ KC AC KC can be written as

  We want to describe the dependence of ã from θ and h.

Recall that for SL(2, R) the Weyl group consists of only two elements and for
X ∈ a we have conv(W.X) = [−1, 1] · X .

Theorem 4.1. Let X ∈ Ω and h ∈ G. Suppose that g = h exp(iX) = k˜1 ãk˜2 ∈

                     g ∈ KC A exp(iconv(WX))KC .

The complex number z 2 + z −2 lies within the shaded region. Therefore, there exists

                                                   Define complex numbers by
         iϕ1             iϕ2
u = r1 e     and v = r2 e . Assume that v + v = λ(u + u−1 ) , with λ ∈ R, λ > 1.
                                              −1

Then, |ϕ2 | ≤ |ϕ1 | .
Proof. Clearly we can assume ϕ2 6= 0. Comparing real and imaginary parts of
v + v −1 = λ(u + u−1 ) , followed by squaring, yields
                          λ2 (r1 + r1−1 )2 cos2 ϕ1 = (r2 + r2−1 )2 cos2 ϕ2 ,
and
(4.3)                 λ2 (r1 − r1−1 )2 sin2 ϕ1 = (r2 − r2−1 )2 sin2 ϕ2 .
Adding these two equations we get
(4.4)            λ2 (r1 − r1−1 )2 + 4λ2 cos2 ϕ1 = (r2 − r2−1 )2 + 4 cos2 ϕ2 .
Combining (4.3) and (4.4) gives

                    5. Applications to spherical functions
   Let us briefly introduce the necessary notation. Write G = N AK for the Iwasawa
decomposition of G = SL(2, R) with N , A and K as in Section 3. For g ∈ G we
define a(g) ∈ A by g ∈ N a(g)K. For λ ∈ a∗C and a ∈ A we set aλ = eλ(log a) .
   Following Harish-Chandra we define the spherical function on G/K with param-
eter λ ∈ a∗C by
                                  Z
                        φλ (gK) =     a(kg)ρ−λ dk     (g ∈ G),
                                         K
where dk denotes the normalized Haar-measure on K and ρ = 12 α with Σ+ = {α}.
  Define
                       Π = {λ ∈ a∗C : φλ is positive definite}
and recall that ia∗ ⊆ Π.
  We have to recall some facts from [13] §4 on the analytic continuation of the
spherical functions (actually valid for all semisimple Lie groups G).
Proposition 5.1. Let λ ∈ a∗C . Then the following assertions hold:
   (1) The spherical function φλ has a unique holomorphic extension to Ξ.
   (2) The spherical function φλ has a unique continuation to a KC -bi-invariant
       function on KC A exp(2iΩ)KC /KC such that the restriction to A exp(2iΩ)
       is holomorphic. Moreover, if λ ∈ Π and Ωc ⊆ Ω is a compact subset, then
       the restriction of φλ to KC A exp(2iΩc )KC /KC is bounded.
                          DOUBLE COSET DECOMPOSITION                               11


  In the sequel we also denote by φλ the holomorphic extension of φλ to Ξ. We
denote by Z = {±1} the center of G. Our result in this section then is:
Theorem 5.2. Let λ ∈ Π. Then the spherical function φλ is bounded on Ξ, i.e.,
                                  kφλ k∞,Ξ < ∞ .
Proof. By Theorem 4.1 we have
                    \
                  Ξ KC AC KC /KC ⊆ KC A exp(iΩ)KC /KC .
                                                      T
Thus Proposition 5.1 implies that φλ is bounded on Ξ KC AC KC /KC .
  Let now z ∈ Ξ such that z 6∈ KC AC KC /KC . By the density of KC AC KC in GC
we can find sequences (kn ) ⊆ KC , (an ) ⊆ AC such that kn an KC ∈ Ξ for all n ∈ N
and z = limn→∞ kn an KC . By Theorem 4.1 we have an ∈ ZA exp(iΩ) and thus
                                      lim an = ±1
                                   n→∞
by Proposition 3.2. By the continuity of φλ we hence obtain that
           φλ (z) = lim φλ (kn an KC ) = lim φλ (an KC ) = φλ (±1) = 1,
                    n→∞                   n→∞
concluding the proof of the theorem.                                               
Remark 5.3. (a) Note that Proposition 5.1 holds for all semisimple Lie groups.
Thus in order to generalize Theorem 5.2 to all semisimple Lie groups one needs
Proposition 3.2 and Theorem 4.1 in full generality (cf. our conjecture in Section 4).
(b) Fix a λ ∈ a∗C and consider the following function on G/K × K
                              Pλ (gK, k) 7→ a(kg)ρ−λ .
Identifying G/K with the unit disc D and K with its boundary, this function is
easily seen to be a power of the Poisson kernel on D. According to [13] the function
Pλ admits an analytic continuation to Ξ × K which is holomorphic in the first
variable. Also by [13] we know that this function is unbounded for λ ∈ Π \ {ρ, −ρ}.
Observe that the spherical function on Ξ is given by
                                 Z
                        φλ (z) =    Pλ (z, k) dk    (z ∈ Ξ) .
                                  K
Now notice that Theorem 5.2 says that φλ stays bounded despite the fact that the
integrands become singular towards the boundary of Ξ.

              6. A norm estimate for the middle projection
  In this section we will investigate the growth of the middle projection in the
KC AC KC -decomposition for elements in Ξ.
  To start with let us introduce a norm on G = SL(2, R) by setting
                            kgk = tr(gg t )      (g ∈ G) .
  Define a compact (here actually finite) group
                         L = NKC (AC ) × Z = NK (A) × Z .
We let L act on AC via
                     (k, z)a = kak −1 z       (k, z) ∈ L, a ∈ AC .
Then for every x ∈ KC AC KC we have x ∈ KC aKC (x)KC with a unique continuous
function

                         aKC : KC AC KC → AC /L, x 7→ aKC (x) .
In view of Theorem 5.2 and its proof we also obtain a holomorphic function
                                   
                                      aKC (x) if x ∈ KC AC KC /KC ,

                                            1 if x 6∈ KC AC KC /KC .
     Finally we define a norm on AC by setting
                                                 
                                           z   0
                  | · | : AC 7→ R+ , a =            7→ |z|2 + |z|−2 .
                                           0 z −1
Notice that | · | is L-invariant hence factors to a continuous positive function on
AC /L also denoted by | · |.
Proposition 6.1. For all g = h exp(iX)KC ∈ Ξ, (h ∈ G, X ∈ Ω), we have
                                     |aKC (g)| ≤ khk .
Proof. Using G = KAK we can write
                                                                               

        |                      {z                              {z     } |
                                                                      }
                          = h ∈ KAK                         ∈ exp(iΩ)
                                                                 
                                                          z   0
We may assume that g ∈ KC AC KC /KC and write aKC (g) =            . Then
                                                          0 z −1
          Φ(g) = (s2 cos2 t + s−2 sin2 t)e2iθ + (s2 sin2 t + s−2 cos2 t)e−2iθ
                 = cos2 t(s2 e2iθ + s−2 e−2iθ ) + sin2 t(s−2 e2iθ + s2 e−2iθ )
(6.1)            = z 2 + z −2 .
Hence z 2 +z −2 is a convex combination of s2 e2iθ +s−2 e−2iθ and s−2 e2iθ +s2 e−2iθ
and therefore lies on the vertical segment shown in Figure 2.

   The following Lemma 6.2 applied to u = s2 e2iθ and v = z 2 completes the proof
of the theorem.                                                                
Lemma 6.2. Let r1 , r2 > 0 and − π2 < ϕ1 , ϕ2 < π2 . Define complex numbers
by u = r1 eiϕ1 and v = r2 eiϕ2 . Assume that ℜ(v + v −1 ) = ℜ(u + u−1 ) and
ℑ(v + v −1 ) = µℑ(u + u−1 ) for some µ ∈ R, |µ| ≤ 1. Then |ϕ2 | ≤ |ϕ1 | and
r2 + r2−1 ≤ r1 + r1−1 .
Proof. The assumption written out in polar coordinates followed by squaring yields

(6.2)                   (r1 + r1−1 )2 cos2 ϕ1 = (r2 + r2−1 )2 cos2 ϕ2 ,
                       µ2 (r1 − r1−1 )2 sin2 ϕ1 = (r2 − r2−1 )2 sin2 ϕ2 .
   If |ϕ2 | > |ϕ1 |, then (6.2) implies
                                (r1 + r1−1 )2 < (r2 + r2−1 )2 .
Since (r1 + r1−1 )2 = (r1 − r1−1 )2 + 4 this means
                                (r1 − r1−1 )2 < (r2 − r2−1 )2 .
But now we end up with
                       µ2 (r1 − r1−1 )2 sin2 ϕ1 < (r2 − r2−1 )2 sin2 ϕ2 ,
which contradicts the assumption. Thus |ϕ2 | ≤ |ϕ1 | proving our first assertion.
The second assertion is now immediate from (6.2).
                                                                               
