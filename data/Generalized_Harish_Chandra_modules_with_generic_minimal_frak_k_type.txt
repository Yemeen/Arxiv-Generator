                                                                      Ivan Penkov and Gregg Zuckerman


                                                  Abstract. We make a first step towards a classification of simple generalized Harish-
                                                  Chandra modules which are not Harish-Chandra modules or weight modules of finite type.
                                                  For an arbitrary algebraic reductive pair of complex Lie algebras (g, k), we construct, via
                                                  cohomological induction, the fundamental series F · (p, E) of generalized Harish-Chandra
                                                  modules. We then use F · (p, E) to characterize any simple generalized Harish-Chandra
                                                  module with generic minimal k-type. More precisely, we prove that any such simple (g, k)-
                                                  module of finite type arises as the unique simple submodule of an appropriate fundamental
                                                  series module F s (p, E) in the middle dimension s. Under the stronger assumption that k
                                                  contains a semisimple regular element of g, we prove that any simple (g, k)-module with
                                                  generic minimal k-type is necessarily of finite type, and hence obtain a reconstruction
                                                  theorem for a class of simple (g, k)-modules which can a priori have infinite type. We also
                                                  obtain generic general versions of some classical theorems of Harish-Chandra, such as the
                                                  Harish-Chandra admissibility theorem. The paper is concluded by examples, in particular
                                                  we compute the genericity condition on a k-type for any pair (g, k) with k ≃ sℓ(2).




                                                                                      Introduction

                                               The goal of the present paper is to make a first step towards a classification of
                                             simple generalized Harish-Chandra modules which are not Harish-Chandra modules or
                                             weight modules of finite type. This work is part of the program of study of generalized
                                             Harish-Chandra modules laid out in [PZ]. Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra. A simple

                                             generalized Harish-Chandra module is by definition a simple g-module with locally
                                             finite action of a reductive in g subalgebra k ⊂ g and with finite k-multiplicities. In
                                             the classical case of Harish-Chandra modules, the pair (g, k) is in addition assumed to
                                             be symmetric. In a recent joint paper with V. Serganova [PSZ], we have constructed

                                             new families of generalized Harish-Chandra modules; however, no general classification

is known beyond the case when the pair (g, k) is symmetric and the case when k is a
Cartan subalgebra of g. The first case is settled in the well-known work of R. Langlands
[L2], A. Knapp and the second named author [KZ], D. Vogan and the second named

author [V2], [Z], A. Beilinson - J. Bernstein [BB] and I. Mirkovic [Mi]; the second case
is settled in a more recent breakthrough by O. Mathieu [M]. Some low rank cases of
certain special non-symmetric pairs (g, k) (where k is not a Cartan subalgebra) have
been settled by G. Savin [Sa].

    In this paper, we consider simple generalized Harish-Chandra modules which have
a generic minimal k-type for some arbitrary fixed reductive pair (g, k) (the precise def-

initions see in Section 1 below). One of our main results is the construction of a series
of (g, k)-modules, which we call the fundamental series (it generalizes the fundamen-
tal series of Harish-Chandra modules), and furthermore the theorem that any simple
generalized Harish-Chandra module with generic minimal k-type is a submodule of the

fundamental series. We refer to the latter result as the first reconstruction theorem
for generalized Harish-Chandra modules. This theorem is based on new results on the
n-cohomology of a simple generalized Harish-Chandra module and on the vanishing
of cohomological induction except in the middle dimension (see Theorem 1 and 2 in

Section 1 below). Under a stronger assumption on the pair (g, k), we also prove a recon-
struction theorem for simple (g, k)-modules which may a priori have infinite type (we
refer to it as the second reconstruction theorem) and in particular a new generic general
version of Harish-Chandra’s admissibility theorem, see Theorem 4 and Corollary 2 in

Section 1.

    Here is a very brief historical perspective. In the 1950’s, the classical Borel-Weil-
Bott theorem opened a new era in representation theory, relating the simple finite
dimensional representations of a semisimple Lie algebra g with the, possibly higher,
cohomology of homogeneous line bundles on the flag variety of a complex algebraic
   GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                       3

group G with Lie algebra g, [S], [Bo]. Soon thereafter, B. Kostant proved a version of the
Borel-Weil-Bott theorem in which the computation of sheaf cohomology was reduced to
Lie algebra cohomology, [Ko]. The work of R. Langlands and W. Schmid extended some

of the results of Borel-Weil, Bott, and Kostant to certain infinite dimensional Harish-
Chandra modules, [L1], [Sc]. In a further step, cohomological induction emerged as
an infinitesimal counter-part to sheaf cohomology, and led to the construction of a
broader class of Harish-Chandra modules, [V2], [Z], [EW]. In contrast to the Borel-

Weil-Bott theorem, where every simple finite dimensional g-module appears as a higher
cohomology group, not every simple Harish-Chandra module appears as a submodule
of a module cohomologically induced from a proper compatible parabolic subalgebra
(the definition of a compatible parabolic subalgebra see in section 1 below). This

observation applies also to generalized Harish-Chandra modules, and therefore the
study of the fundamental series is only a first step towards a classification of simple
generalized Harish-Chandra modules. Moreover, the construction and characterization
of the fundamental series is merely a branch of a tree whose trunk is the classical

Borel-Weil-Bott theorem.

  One more common feature of this present work with the work of Armand Borel is

that we study general (non-symmetric) reductive pairs (g, k), which have appeared in
Borel’s work on the topology of homogeneous spaces, [B].

  The paper is organized as follows. In section 0 we fix the notation. In section 1
we present a minimum of background material and then state the main new results.
Theorems 1-4 and Corollaries 1-2. Sections 2 and 3 are the technical core of the paper;

in section 2 we prove Theorem 1, and in section 3 we prove all other results of section
1. Unfortunately, the proofs are not self-contained as our work relies heavily on the
machinery developed by D. Vogan in the course of his fundamental work [V2]. We
state all results in the generality we need them but we often refer to [V2] for the proof
4                      IVAN PENKOV AND GREGG ZUCKERMAN

if it does not require essential modifications. Finally in section 4, we discuss some
particular cases in our construction, and in particular consider in more detail the case
when k is a sℓ(2)-subalgebra. In this case, the genericity condition on a k-type reduces

to a simple explicit inequality.

    The ground field is C, and if not explicitly stated otherwise, all vector spaces and

Lie algebras are defined over C. By definition, N = {0, 1, 2, . . . }. The sign ⊗ denotes
tensor product over C. The superscript ∗ indicates dual space. The sign ⊂
                                                                        + stands
for semidirect sum of Lie algebras (if l = l′ ⊂
                                              + l′′ , l′ is an ideal in l and l′′ ≃ l/l′ ).



H · (l, M ) stands for the cohomology of a Lie algebra l with coefficients in an l-module

M , and M l = H 0 (l, M ) stands for space of l-invariants of M . Λ· ( ) and S · ( ) denote
respectively the exterior and symmetric algebra.

    If l is a Lie algebra, then U (l) stands for the enveloping algebra of l and ZU(l)
denotes the center of U (l). We identify l-modules with U (l)-modules. It is well known
that if l is finite dimensional and M is a simple l-module (or equivalently a simple U (l)-

module), ZU(l) acts on M via a ZU(l) -character, i.e. via an algebra homomorphism
θM : ZU(l) → C. By Z(l) we denote the center of the Lie algebra l.

    If l is a Lie algebra, M is an l-module, and ω ∈ l∗ , we put
M ω := {m ∈ M |l · m = ω(l)m ∀ℓ ∈ l}. We call M ω a weight space of M and we say
that M is an l-weight module if
                                            M
                                      M=           M ω.

By suppl M we denote the set {ω ∈ l∗ |M ω 6= 0}.

  A finite multiset is a function f from a finite set D into N. A submultiset of f is a
multiset f ′ defined on the same domain D such that f ′ (d) ≤ f (d) for any d ∈ D. For
                                                                              P
any finite multiset f , defined on an additive monoid D, we can put ρf := 12    f (d)d.

If M is an l-weight module as above, and dim M < ∞, M determines the finite multiset
chl M which is the function ω 7→ dim M ω defined on suppl M .


                               1. Statement of results

1.1. Reductive pairs, compatible parabolics and generic k-types. Let g be a

finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebra and k ⊂ g be an algebraic subalgebra which
is reductive in g. We fix a Cartan subalgebra t of k and a Cartan subalgebra h of g such
that t ⊂ h. (If (g, k) is a symmetric pair, then h is unique and is called a fundamental
Cartan subalgebra. An important feature of the general case we consider is that h is

no longer unique). By ∆ we denote the set of h-roots of g, i.e. ∆ = {supph g}\{0}.
Note that, since k is reductive in g, g is a t-weight module. Therefore we can set
∆t := {suppt g}\{0}. Note also that the R-span of the roots of g fixes a real structure

on h∗ , whose projection onto t∗ is a well-defined real structure on t∗ . In what follows,
we will denote by Reλ the real part of an element λ ∈ t∗ . We fix also a Borel subalgebra
bk ⊂ k with bk ⊃ t. Then bk = t ⊃
                                + n , where n is the nilradical of b . We set ρ := ρ
                                   k         k                      k                cht nk .

The quintet g, h, k, bk, t will be fixed throughout the paper. By Wk we denote the Weyl

group of k.
  As usual, we will parametrize the characters of ZU(g) via the Harish-Chandra ho-
momorphism. More precisely, if bg is a given Borel subalgebra of g with bg ⊃ h (bg
will be specified below), the ZU(g) -character corresponding to κ ∈ h∗ via the Harish-

Chandra homomorphism defined by bg will be denoted by θκ (θρchh bg is then the trivial
ZU(g) -character).
  By h , i we denote the unique g-invariant symmetric bilinear form on g∗ such that
hα, αi = 2 for any long root of a simple component of g. The form h , i enables us
6                       IVAN PENKOV AND GREGG ZUCKERMAN

to identify g with g∗ . Then h is identified with h∗ , and k is identified with k∗ . We
will sometimes consider h , i as a form on g. The superscript ⊥ indicates orthogonal
space. Note that there is a canonical k-module decomposition g = k ⊕ k⊥ . We also set

kκk2 := hκ, κi for any κ ∈ h∗ .
    We say that an element λ ∈ t∗ is (g, k)-regular if hReλ, σi =
                                                                6 0 for all σ ∈ ∆t . To any
λ ∈ t∗ we associate the following parabolic subalgebra pλ of g:

                                                  M
                                    pλ = h ⊕ (          gα ),
                                                 α∈∆λ


where ∆λ := {α ∈ ∆ | hReλ, αi ≥ 0}. By mλ and nλ we denote respectively the
reductive part of pλ (containing h) and the nilradical of pλ . In particular pλ = mλ ⊃
                                                                                     + n ,
                                                                                        λ

and if λ is bk -dominant, then pλ ∩ k = nk . We call pλ a parabolic subalgebra compatible

with t, or simply a compatible parabolic subalgebra. A compatible parabolic subalgebra
                                      ∗
p = m ⊃
      + n (i.e. p = p
                      λ for some λ ∈ t ) is minimal if it does not properly contain

another compatible parabolic subalgebra. It is an important observation that if p =

m ⊃
  + n is minimal, then t ⊂ Z(m). Furthermore, it is easy to see that a compatible



parabolic subalgebra pλ is minimal if and only if mλ equals the centralizer C(t) of t in
g, or equivalently if and only if λ is (g, k)-regular.
    A k-type is by definition a simple finite dimensional k-module. By V (µ) we will

denote a k-type with bk -highest weight µ (µ is then k-integral and bk -dominant). Let
V (µ) be a k-type such that µ + 2ρ is (g, k) regular, and let p = m ⊃
                                                                    + n be the minimal



compatible parabolic subalgebra pµ+2ρ . Put ρn := ρcht n . We define V (µ) to be generic
if the following two conditions hold:

    (1) hReµ + 2ρ − ρn , αi ≥ 0 ∀α ∈ suppt nk :
    (2) hReµ + 2ρ − ρS , ρS i > 0 for every submultiset S of cht n.


1.2. (g, k)-modules of finite type and minimal k-types. For the purposes of this
paper we will call a g-module M a (g, k)-module if M is isomorphic as a k-module to a
      GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                      7

direct sum of isotypic components of k-types. If M is a (g, k)-module, we write M [µ] for
the V (µ)-isotypic component of M , and we say that V (µ) is a k-type of M if M [µ] 6= 0.
We say that a (g, k)-module is of finite type if dim M [µ] 6= ∞ for every k-type V (µ). We

will also refer to (g, k)-modules of finite type as generalized Harish-Chandra modules.

   Let Θk be the discrete subgroup of Z(k)∗ generated by suppZ(k) g. By M we denote
the class of (g, k)-modules M for which there exists a finite subset S ⊂ Z(k)∗ such that
suppZ(k) M ⊂ S + Θk . If M is a module in M, a k-type V (µ) of M is minimal if the
function µ′ 7→ kReµ′ + 2ρk2 defined on the set {µ′ ∈ t∗ | M [µ′ ] 6= 0} has a minimum

at µ. Any non-zero (g, k)-module M in M has a minimal k-type. This follows from
the fact that the squared length of a vector has a minimum on every shifted lattice in
Euclidean space.


1.3. Existence of n-cohomology. Our first result in this paper is the following
analog of a theorem of Vogan, [V1], [V2].

Theorem 1. Let M be a module in M which has a generic minimal k-type V (µ).
There is a vector space isomorphism

                                                                  ⊥
(3)                    (M n∩k )µ ⊗ Λr (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ ∼
                                                 = H r (n, M )µ−2ρn ,


where n := nµ+2ρ , ρ⊥                                     ⊥
                    n := ρcht (n∩k⊥ ) , and r := dim(n ∩ k ). Moreover,


                                                  ⊥
                                   H i (n, M )µ−2ρn = 0


for i 6= r.


1.4. The fundamental series of generalized Harish-Chandra modules. Our
second result is the following construction of a new series of (g, k)-modules of finite type
which we call the fundamental series of generalized Harish-Chandra modules. Recall
8                          IVAN PENKOV AND GREGG ZUCKERMAN

that the functor of k-locally finite vectors Γk,t is a well-defined left exact functor on the
category of (g, t)-modules with values in (g, k)-modules,
                                                      X
                          Γk,t (M ) =                                       M ′.
                                        M ′ ⊂M,dim M ′ =1,dim U(k)·M ′ <∞
                L
By R· Γk,t :=         Ri Γk,t we denote as usual the total right derived functor of Γk,t , see
                i≥0
[PZ] and the references therein.
    We need also the following “production” or “coinduction” functor from the category
of (p, t)-modules to the category of (g, t)-modules:

                             prog,t
                                p,t (N ) := Γt,0 (HomU(p) (U (g), N )).


The functor prog,t
               p,t is exact.

    We are now ready to state our second theorem, which constructs and describes the
fundamental series of (g, k)-modules of finite type F · (p, E).

Theorem 2. Let p = m ⊃
                     + n be a minimal compatible parabolic subalgebra, E be a sim-



ple finite dimensional p-module on which t acts via the weight ω ∈ t∗ , ρn := ρcht n , ρ⊥
                                                                                        n :=

ρcht (n∩k⊥ ) , and µ := ω + 2ρ⊥
                              n . Set


                           F · (p, E) := R· Γk,t (prog,t
                                                     p,t (E ⊗ Λ
                                                               dim n
                                                                     (n))).

Then the following assertions hold under the assumptions that p = pµ+2ρ and that µ is

bk -dominant, k-integral and yields a generic k-type V (µ).
    a) F · (p, E) is a (g, k)-module of finite type in the class M, and ZU(g) acts on F · (p, E)
via the ZU(g) -character θν+ρ̃ where ρ̃ := ρchh b for some fixed Borel subalgebra b of g
with b ⊃ h, b ⊂ p and b ∩ k = bk , and where ν is the b-highest weight of E (note that

ν |t = ω).
    b) F i (p, E) = 0 for i 6= s := dim nk (equivalently s = dim(n ∩ k)).
    c) There is a k-module isomorphism

                                 F s (p, E)[µ] ∼
                                               = Cdim E ⊗ V (µ),
   GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                        9

and V (µ) is the unique minimal k-type of F s (p, E).

   d) Let F̄ s (p, E) be the g-submodule of F s (p, E) generated by F s (p, E)[µ]. Then
F̄ s (p, E) is the unique simple submodule of F s (p, E), and moreover, F̄ s (p, E) is a

submodule of any g-submodule of F s (p, E).

   e) For any non-zero g-submodule M of F s (p, E) there is an isomorphism of m-
modules

                                     H r (n, M )ω ∼
                                                  = E.


1.5. Reconstruction theorems. The results in this subsection constitute our main
results.

Theorem 3 (First reconstruction theorem). Let M be a simple (g, k)-module of
finite type with a minimal k-type V (µ) which is generic. Then p := pµ+2ρ = m ⊃
                                                                              + n is



a minimal compatible parabolic subalgebra. Let ω := µ − 2ρ⊥
                                                          n and E be the p-module

H r (n, M )ω with trivial n-action, where r = dim(n ∩ k⊥ ). Then E is a simple p-module,
the pair (p, E) satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 2, and M is canonically isomorphic
to F̄ s (p, E) for s = dim(n ∩ k).

Corollary 1 (Generic version of a theorem of Harish-Chandra). There exist at

most finitely many simple (g, k)-modules M of finite type with a fixed ZU(g) -character
such that a minimal k-type of M is generic. (Moreover, each such M has a unique
minimal k-type by Theorem 2, c).)

   Proof of Corollary 1. By Theorems 2 and 3, if M is a simple (g, k)-module of
finite type with generic minimal k-type V (µ) for some µ, then the ZU(g) -character of

M is θν+ρ̃ . There are finitely many Borel subalgebras b as in Theorem 2, a); hence, if
θν+ρ̃ is fixed, there are finitely many possibilities for the weight ν (as θν+ρ̃ determines
ν + ρ̃ up to a finite choice). Therefore, there are a finitely many possibilities for the
p-module E, and hence there are finitely many possibilities for M . 

Theorem 4 (Second reconstruction theorem). Assume that the pair (g, k) is reg-
ular, i.e. t contains a regular element of g. Let M be a simple (g, k)-module (a priori
of infinite type) with a minimal k-type V (µ) which is generic. Then M has finite type,

and hence by Theorem 3, M is canonically isomorphic to F̄ s (p, E) (where p, E and s
are as in Theorem 3).

Corollary 2. Let the pair (g, k) be regular.

     a) There exist at most finitely many simple (g, k)-modules M with a fixed ZU(g) -

character, such that a minimal k-type of M is generic. All such M are of finite type,
(and have a unqiue minimal k-type by Theorem 2, c)).

     b) (Generic version of Harish-Chandra’s admissibility theorem) Every simple (g, k)-

module with a generic minimal k-type has finite type.

     Proof of Corollary 2 The proof of a) is as the proof of Corollary 1 but uses
Theorem 4 instead of Theorem 3, and b) is a direct consequence of Theorem 4. 

     The proofs of Theorem 1-4 depend heavily on adaptations of certain important

results of D. Vogan [V2], from the case of a symmetric pair to the case of a general
reductive pair (g, k), and are presented in the following sections 2 and 3.


                                    2. n-cohomology

     In this section we present the minimum material on n-cohomology necessary to
outline the proof of Theorem 1.

     Let p = m ⊃
               + n be a compatible parabolic subalgebra corresponding to an element



λ ∈ t∗ (i.e. p = pλ ) which we assume k-regular, and let M be a (g, k)-module in M.

Proposition 1. In the category of t-weight modules, there exists a bounded (not nec-
essarily first quadrant) cohomology spectral sequence which converges to H · (n, M ), with


                            E1a,b = H a+b−R(a) (n ∩ k, M ) ⊗ Va∗ ,
      GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                      11

where a runs over {0, . . . , n} for some n, R is a monotonic function on {0, . . . , n} with
values in N such that R(a) ≤ a and R(n) = r, Va is a t-submodule of ΛR(a) (n ∩ k⊥ ) for
every a, and Vn = Λr (n ∩ k⊥ ).

  The spectral sequence whose existence is claimed in Proposition 1 is a version of
the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence and is constructed explicitly by Vogan in [V2,

Theorem 5.2.2] under the assumption that the pair (g, k) is symmetric. However, as
this assumption is not used in the construction, we refer the reader directly to [V2].
  Proposition 1 has the following corollary.

Corollary 3.
  a) If M is a (g, k)-module of finite type, then H · (n, M ) is an (m, t)-module of finite
type. Moreover, if M is ZU(g) -finite (i.e. the action of ZU(g) on M factors through a
finite dimensional quotient of ZU(g) ) then H · (n, M ) is ZU(m) -finite.

  b) If p is a minimal compatible parabolic subalgebra and M is a (g, k)-module of finite
type which is in addition ZU(g) -finite, then H · (n, M ) is finite dimensional.

Proof. a) is a straightforward generalization of [V2, Corollary 5.2.4]. Part b) follows

from a) and from the observation that t ⊂ Z(m) whenever p is minimal. Indeed, as
H · (n, M ) is an (m, t)-module of finite type and t ⊂ Z(m), H · (n, M ) considered as an
m-module is a direct sum of finite dimensional isotypic components. The fact that
H · (n, M ) is ZU(m) -finite implies that there are only finitely many such components, i.e.

that dim H · (n, M ) < ∞. 

Corollary 4. For each κ ∈ t∗ we have a spectral sequence of vector spaces which

converges to H · (n, M )κ and whose E1 -term is (E1a,b )κ , where E1a,b is as in Proposition
1. Moreover, there are (edge) homomorphisms

                κ+2ρ⊥                       ⊥
(4)           πi    n
                        : H i (n ∩ k, M )κ+2ρn ⊗ Λr (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ → H i+r (n, M )κ ,

where i = n + b − r.
12                        IVAN PENKOV AND GREGG ZUCKERMAN

Proof. The fact that the spectral sequence of Proposition 1 is a spectral sequence in
the category of weight t-modules implies that it has a well-defined direct summand
consisting of κ-weight vectors. Its corresponding E1a,b -term equals (E1a,b )κ .

     In [V2, 5.2] Vogan constructs (under the assumption that the pair (g, k) is symmetric)
linear maps (E1n,b )κ → (E∞
                          n,b κ
                             ) which in turn yield edge homomorphisms for the spectral
sequence with term (E1a,b )κ ,

        κ+2ρ⊥                        ⊥                                          M
      πi    n
                : H i (n ∩ k, M )κ+2ρn ⊗ Λr (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ → H i+r (n, M )κ ∼
                                                                        =               a,b κ
                                                                                      (E∞  ) .
                                                                            a+b=i+r


This construction extends to the more general case we consider, and we refer the reader
to [V2]. 

                                                                            ⊥
Proposition 2. Under the hypothesis of Theorem 1, (E1a,b )µ−2ρn = 0 for (a, b) 6=

(n, r − n); therefore the spectral sequence from Corollary 4 for κ = µ − 2ρ⊥
                                                                           n collapses

at the level E1 .

Proof. Let V (δ) be a k-type such that


                              H i (n ∩ k, V (δ)) ⊗ Λj (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ 6= 0


for some (i, j) 6= (0, r). Then, according to [V2, 5.4] there exist σ ∈ Wk and a submulti-
set A of cht (n∩k⊥ ) such that σ(δ+ρ)−ρ = µ−2ρA . Hence σ(δ+2ρ) = µ+ρ−2ρA +σρ =
µ + 2ρ − (2ρA + ρ − σρ) = µ + 2ρ − 2ρB for an appropriate submultiset B of cht n.

Furthermore, as V (µ) is generic, hReµ + 2ρ − ρB , ρB i > 0 by condition (2), and thus


kReδ + 2ρk2 = kσ(Reδ + 2ρ)k2 = kReµ + 2ρk2 − 4hReµ + 2ρ − ρB , ρB i < kReµ + 2ρk2 .


As V (µ) is minimal in M , V (δ) is not a k-type of M , and hence

                                                                 ⊥
                            (H i (n ∩ k.M ) ⊗ Λj (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ )µ−2ρn = 0
      GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                         13

                                         ⊥                                               ⊥
for (i, j) 6= (0, r). Since (E1a,b )µ−2ρn ⊂ (H i (n ∩ k, M ) ⊗ Λj (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ )µ−2ρn for
i = a + b − R(a) and j = R(a), we obtain

                                                        ⊥
                                         (E1a,b )µ−2ρn = 0

for (a, b) 6= (n, r − n). 

   Theorem 1 follows from Proposition 2 via the observations: first,

                                ⊥        M                  ⊥        M              ⊥
                 H i (n, M )µ−2ρn ∼
                                  =            a,b µ−2ρn
                                             (E∞  )      =               (E1a,b )µ−2ρn
                                        a+b=i                     a+b=i
                            ⊥
and hence H i (n, M )µ−2ρn = 0 for i 6= r, and second, the desired isomorphism (3) is

nothing but the edge isomorphism π0µ . 


      3. Construction and characterization of the fundamental series

   In this section we prove Theorems 2-4. We have split the proof into several state-
ments, some of which are of interest by themselves. Throughout this section, p, E, ρ⊥
                                                                                    n , µ, ω

and s are as in Theorem 2 (with the hypotheses of Theorem 2 holding) and are assumed
fixed.

Proposition 3. Let V (δ) be a k-type of F s−i (p, E) for some i ∈ Z.
   a) There exists w ∈ Wk of length i (in particular, i ∈ N) and a multiset

                                   n· := suppt (n ∩ k⊥ ) → N,

                                         β 7→ nβ

such that
                                                                X
(5)                         ω = w(δ + ρ) − ρ − 2ρ⊥
                                                 n −                 nβ β.
                                                                 β

Furthermore, the multiplicity of V (δ) in F s−i (p, E) is bounded by the integer
                                         X
                                dim E            dim(S · (n ∩ k⊥ )ξ(w) ),
                                        ℓ(w)=i
14                              IVAN PENKOV AND GREGG ZUCKERMAN

where ξ(w) is the t-weight w(δ + ρ) − ρ − ω − 2ρ⊥     ·      ⊥
                                                n in S (n ∩ k ).

     b) The equality

                                   X
(6)                                       (−1)i dim Homk (V (δ), F s−i (p, E))
                                  0≤i≤s


       X                X
                        ∞
                                                                                                    ⊥
=             (−1)j (         dim Homt (H j (n ∩ k, V (δ)), S m (n ∩ k⊥ ) ⊗ E ⊗ Λdim(n∩k ) (n ∩ k⊥ )))
      0≤j≤s             m=0

holds, and the inner sum on the right hand side of (6) is finite.

     Proposition 3 is a modification of Vogan’s Theorem 6.3.12 and Corollary 6.3.13 in

[V2], and its proof follows exactly the same lines (an inspection of Vogan’s proofs reveals
that the symmetry assumption on (g, k) is not needed). Therefore, we refer the reader
to [V2].
     Proposition 3 implies that F · (p, E) is a (g, k)-module of finite type, and also that

F i (p, E) = 0 for i > s. Furthermore, Proposition 3 implies that F · (p, E) is in the class
M. To see this, one has to restrict (5) to Z(k) and notice that the one element set
{ω|Z(k) } can be chosen as the finite set S that appears in the definition of the class M.

Proposition 4. Suppose V (δ) is a k-type of F s−i (p, E) and


(7)                                (H · (n ∩ k, V (δ)) ⊗ Λ· (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ )ω 6= 0.


Then i = 0.

Proof. By Proposition 3, a) there exist w and n· such that (5) holds. Since δ is dominant

with respect to bk ,
                                                          X
                                           wδ = δ −                   mα α
                                                      α∈suppt (n∩k)

for some mα ∈ R, mα ≥ 0. Thus we can rewrite (5) as

                                                   X                         X
(8)                     δ = µ + ρ − wρ +                       mα α +                       nβ β.
                                               α∈suppt (n∩k)            β∈suppt   (n∩k⊥ )
      GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                           15

  On the other hand, assumption (7) implies via Kostant’s theorem, [Ko], the existence
of an element σ ∈ Wk and a submultiset q· of cht (n ∩ k⊥ ) such that
                                                         X
                      σ(δ + ρ) − ρ − 2ρ⊥
                                       n +                           qγ γ = ω,
                                                   γ∈suppt (n∩k⊥ )

or equivalently
                                                                 X
(9)                  σ(δ + ρ) = ω + ρn + (ρ⊥
                                           n −                               qγ γ),
                                                         γ∈suppt   (n∩k⊥ )

as ρn = ρ + ρ⊥
             n . Notice that

                              X                                        X
                  ρ⊥
                   n −                     qγ γ = σ −1 (ρ⊥
                                                         n −                       qγ′ γ)
                         γ∈suppt (n∩k⊥ )                         γ∈suppt (n∩k⊥ )

for an appropriate submultiset q·′ of suppt (n ∩ k⊥ ). Moreover, the genericity condition

(1) on µ, rewritten in terms of ω, reads hReω + ρn , αi ≥ 0 for all α ∈ suppt (n ∩ k).
Hence,
                                                                   X
                    σ −1 (Reω + ρn ) = Reω + ρn −                               pα α
                                                               α∈suppt (n∩k)

for some pα ∈ R, pα ≥ 0. Since ω + 2ρ⊥
                                     n is bk -dominant, hImω, αi = 0 for α ∈

suppt (n ∩ k), and hence σ −1 (Im ω) = Im ω. All of this allows us to rewrite (9) as
                                           X                               X
(10)          δ = ω + ρn − ρ −                     pα α + ρ⊥
                                                           n −                         qγ γ.

  By comparing (8) and (10), we obtain
                                      X                           X

                                 X                        X
                     =−                     pα α −                     qγ′ γ.
                            α∈suppt (n∩k)            β∈suppt (n∩k⊥ )

Since hReµ + 2ρ, ηi > 0 for every η ∈ suppt n, (11) implies
                                            P
hReµ + 2ρ, ρ − wρi ≤ 0. As ρ − wρ =                 nα α for nα ∈ N, we obtain hReµ +

2ρ, ρ − wρi = 0, or equivalently ρ = wρ. Therefore, w = id and, since i is the length of
w, i = 0. 

Proposition 5. (Analog of Frobenius reciprocity) For any (g, k)-module M there exist

                                                    (n))) and respective E2a,b -terms:

                             I2a,b = Extag,k (M, F b (p, E)),

                            II2a,b = Extam,t (H dim n−b (n, M ), E).


     The proof is the same as the proof [V2, Proposition 6.3.2] and we omit it.
     We are now able to complete the proof of Theorem 2, b). We have already shown

that F i (p, E) = 0 for i > s and now we will show that F i (p, E) = 0 also for i < s.
Suppose F · (p, E) 6= 0 and let l0 be the minimal integer with F l0 (p, E) 6= 0.
     Set M = F l0 (p, E). Then

                                  Homg,k (M, F l0 (p, E)) 6= 0,

and I2a,b = 0 for a + b < l0 . Therefore the spectral sequence I yields an isomor-
                                                                                    L a,b
phism I20,l0 → I∞0,l0
                      , hence I∞  0,l0
                                       6= 0. As I and II have the same limit,            I∞ =
 L       a,b            a0 ,b0
                                                                                  a+b=l0
      II∞    . Thus II∞        6= 0 for some a0 , b0 with a0 + b0 = l0 , and consequently
a+b=l0

                                     (H dim n−b0 (n, M ), E) 6= 0.

     By Corollary 3, b) D := H dim n−b0 (n, M ) is a finite dimensional t-weight m-module.

D has a canonical decomposition as
                                         M
                                         x
                                                Cj ⊗ Bj
                                          j=1

where Cj are simple non-isomorphic (finite dimensional) modules over the semisimple
part mss of m and Bj are (finite dimensional not necessarily semisimple) Z(m)-modules.
Similarly, we can factor E as C ⊗ B, where C is a simple mss -module and B is a 1-

dimensional Z(m)-module. By the Kunneth formula, [We],
                                    M
              Extam,t (D, E) =                 Extpmss (Cj , C) ⊗ ExtqZ(m),t (Bj , B).

     GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                               17

Furthermore, by Whitehead’s lemma, [We],

                                            Ext·mss (Cj , C) = 0

if Cj and C are inequivalent. Thus (12) implies that C ≃ Cj0 for exactly one value j0
of j and
                                         M
                 Extam,t
                      0
                         (D, E) ≃               Extpmss (Cj0 , C) ⊗ ExtqZ(m),t (Bj0 , B).
                                       p+q=a0

The non-vanishing of Ext·Z(m),t (Bj0 , B) implies that the 1-dimensional Z(m)-module B

is a quotient of Bj0 , and hence the m-module E = C ⊗ B is a quotient of the m-module
D ≃ C ⊗ Bj0 . Therefore we can now conclude that

                                         (H dim n−b0 (n, M ))ω 6= 0.

     As a next step, we apply the spectral sequence from Proposition 1 to show that

                               (H · (n ∩ k, M ), V (δ)) ⊗ Λ· (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ )ω 6= 0,

and we complete the proof of Theorem 2, b) by applying Proposition 4 which yields
s − l0 = 0, i.e. l0 = s. 
     Next we prove assertion c) of Theorem 2. Theorem 2, b) enables us to rewrite (6)

as

Since p = pµ+2ρ , hReµ + 2ρ, αi > 0 ∀α ∈ suppt n; hence

               {σ̃(µ + ρ) − ρ | σ̃ ∈ Wk } ⊂ {µ −                        mβ β | mβ ∈ N}.

Therefore,

and consequently

                                                                          ⊥

only for m = 0. This shows that


              dim Homk (V (µ), F s (p, E))
                                                                 ⊥
              = dim Homt (H 0 (n ∩ k, V (µ)), E ⊗ Λdim(n∩k ) (n ∩ k⊥ )) = dim E,


i.e. that V (µ) is a k-type of F s (p, E) with multiplicity dim E.
     Furthermore, if F s (p, E)[δ] 6= 0 for some V (δ), δ 6= µ, equality (8) holds with w = id
by Proposition 4, i.e.

Hence hReµ + 2ρ, αi > 0 ∀α ∈ suppt n implies


                                 kReδ + 2ρk2 > kReµ + 2ρk2 ,


i.e. V (µ) is the unique minimal type of F s (p, E). This completes the proof of Theorem

2, c). 

                                   Extg,k (M, F s (p, E)).

If, in addition, M is a (g, k)-module of finite type on which ZU(g) acts via a character,

the spectral sequence is a first quadrant spectral sequence (i.e. E2a,b = 0 for b ≤ 0), and
the corner isomorphism E20,0 → E∞
                                0,0
                                    yields an isomorphism

(13)                   Homg (M, F s (p, E)) ≃ Homm (H r (n, M ), E).


Proof. The existence is proved by essentially the same argument as in the proof of [V2,
Corollary 6.3.4] and uses Proposition 2 and Theorem 2, b). 

   If M is a (g, k)-module of finite type which affords a ZU(g) -chracter, H · (n, M ) is

finite dimensional by Corollary 3, b). Choose b0 to be the least possible integer with

                               Ext·m,t (H r−b0 (n, M ), E) 6= 0.

By the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 2, b), we conclude that

                               Homm (H r−b0 (n, M ), E) 6= 0.

Thus E20,b0 6= 0 and E2a,b = 0 for b < b0 . Consequently E20,b0 ≃ E∞
                                                                   0,b0
                                                                        , and we deduce
that Extbg,k
          0
             (M, F s (p, E)) 6= 0. This enables us to conclude that the spectral sequence

is a first quadrant spectral sequence as b0 ≥ 0, and thus the corner isomorphism yields
the desired isomorphism (13). (Compare our proof with the proof of Theorem 6.5.9, f)
in [V2]) 

Corollary 5. If M is a submodule of F s (p, E), then (H r (n, M ))ω 6= 0.

Proposition 7. Let M be a (g, k)-module with the property that M [δ] = 0 for all δ

with kReδ + 2ρk2 < kReµ + 2ρk2 . Then the isomorphism (3) holds, and in particular
M [µ] 6= 0 if and only if H r (n, M )ω 6= 0.

Proof. The statement is a consequence of the proof of Theorem 1. 
20                        IVAN PENKOV AND GREGG ZUCKERMAN

Proposition 8. For every submodule M ⊂ F s (p, E), M [µ] 6= 0.

Proof. The statement is a direct consequence of Theorem 2, c), Corollary 5 and Propo-
sition 7. 

     We are now ready to prove Theorem 2, d). We start with the remark that, if M
is any (g, k)-module of finite type, and Mk∗ is its k-finite dual, i.e. Mk∗ = Γk,0 (M ∗ ),
then M [µ]∗ is a k-isotypic component of Mk∗ . Consider the (g, k)-module of finite type
M := F s (p, E) and note that Proposition 7 implies that F s (p, E)∗k is generated by its

isotypic component M [µ]∗ . Indeed, if X is the submodule of F s (p, E)∗k generated by
M [µ]∗ , and Y is the submodule of F s (p, E) orthogonal to X, then Y [µ] = 0. Hence
Y = 0 by Proposition 8, i.e. X = F s (p, E)∗k .
     Since F s (p, E)∗k is generated by M [µ]∗ , F s (p, E)∗ is of course finitely generated, and

as U (g) is a left Noetherian algebra, F s (p, E)∗k is a Noetherian g-module. Therefore
F s (p, E) is an Artinian g-module. Denote by F̄ s (p, E) the g-submodule of F s (p, E)
generated by F s (p, E)[µ]. Then F̄ s (p, E) is both Noetherian and Artinian, and hence
by a standard argument in module theory, has finite length.

     Let M1 be a simple submodule of F̄ s (p, E). By (13), there is a non-zero m-module
map of H r (n, M1 )ω onto E. By Proposition 7, there is an isomorphism

                        H 0 (n ∩ k, M1 )µ ⊗ Λr (n ∩ k⊥ )∗ ∼
                                                          = H r (n, M1 )ω ,

and hence dim H 0 (n ∩ k, M1 )µ ≥ dim E. But we also know that

                               dim H 0 (n ∩ k, F s (p, E)) = dim E,

by Theorem 2, c). Thus,

                                 dim H 0 (n ∩ k, M1 )µ = dim E

and hence
                                      M1 [µ] = F s (p, E)[µ].
   GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                      21

We conclude that
                                      M1 = F̄ s (p, E),

and the proof of Theorem 2, d) is complete.      
  The proof of Theorem 2, e) is similar.
  We are now ready to prove Theorem 3. Since M is a simple (g, k)-module of finite

type, M is in the class M and ZU(g) acts on M via a character. Therefore, by Corollary
3, H · (n, M ) is a finite dimensional t-weight m-module. By Theorem 1, H r (n, M )ω 6= 0.
Let Ẽ be any simple quotient of the m-module H r (n, M )ω . Consider Ẽ as a simple
p-module by letting n act trivially on Ẽ.

  The fact that µ is generic implies that the pair (p, Ẽ) satisfies the hypotheses of
Theorem 2. Thus F s (p, Ẽ) 6= 0 and there is a canonical isomorphism


(14)                  Homg (M, F s (p, Ẽ)) ∼
                                            = Homm (H r (n, M ), Ẽ).


Hence, the surjection H r (n, M ) → Ẽ determines, via (14), a canonical g-module iso-
morphism


(15)                                  M∼
                                       = F̄ s (p, Ẽ).


Therefore, by Theorem 2, e) Ẽ is isomorphic to H r (n, M )ω , and the surjection
H r (n, M )ω → Ẽ can be chosen as the identity map. This implies finally that the
isomorphism (15) is a canonical isomorphism


                                      M∼

for E = H r (n, M )ω , as required.   
  Here is the proof of Theorem 4. The regularity of k in g implies that m equals
the Cartan subalgebra h. Since M is simple, M affords a ZU(g) -character, and the
Casselman-Osborne theorem, [CO], implies that U (h) = S · (h) acts on H · (n, M ) through

a finite dimensional quotient Q· . Let J be the radical of the algebra Q. Since J is
nilpotent, for any non-zero Q-module Z, Z/JZ 6= 0, and hence (by Zorn’s Lemma)
Z has a 1-dimensional quotient. By Theorem 1, H r (n, M )ω is a non-zero Q-module

(possibly infinite dimensional). Let Ẽ be a 1-dimensional quotient of H r (n, M )ω . The
pair (p, Ẽ) satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 2 and hence F s (p, Ẽ) is non-zero, whereas
F i (p, Ẽ) = 0 for i 6= s.
     By [V2, Corollary 6.3.4], we have a bounded spectral sequence with E2 -term

                                  Extah,t (H (dim n−s)−b (n, X), Ẽ)

which converges to
                                           a+b
                                        Extg,k (X, F s (p, Ẽ))

for any (g, k)-module X. Set X = M in the above and recall that dim n − s = r. Our

spectral sequence becomes

                                                         a+b
                      Extah,t (H r−b (n, M )ω , Ẽ) ⇒ Extg,k (M, F s (p, Ẽ)).

     Following Theorem 6.5.9 and its proof in [V2], choose b0 to be the least possible

integer with
                                  Ext·h,t (H r−b0 (n, M )ω , Ẽ) 6= 0.

Let I be the maximal ideal in Q which annihilates Ẽ. By elementary homological
algebra,
                                 Ext·h,t ((H r−b0 (n, M )ω )I , Ẽ) 6= 0

where the subscript I indicates localization at I. But then

                              E20,b0 = Homh (H r−b0 (n, M )ω , Ẽ) 6= 0,

and by the assumption on b0 , E2a,b = 0 for any b < b0 . So E20,b0 ∼  0,b0
                                                                   = E∞    , and we deduce
that

                                     Extbg,k
                                          0
                                             (M, F s (p, Ẽ)) 6= 0.

Thus, b0 ≥ 0 and our spectral sequence is a first quadrant spectral sequence. The
corner isomorphism becomes

                      Homg (M, F s (p, Ẽ)) ∼
                                            = Homh (H r (n, M ), Ẽ),

and by the choice of Ẽ, the right hand side is nonzero. Thus, M ∼
                                                                 = F̄ s (p, E). This
completes the proof of Theorem 4. 


                            4. Discussion and examples

  The results of this paper are well known when (g, k) is a symmetric pair. More pre-
cisely, in this case, Theorem 4 is the famous Harish-Chandra admissibility theorem and
holds without the genericity condition on V (µ) (in addition, the regularity assumption
for (g, k) is automatic in this case), and Theorems 1-3 are results of Vogan and are

proved in [V2] under less restrictive conditions than the genericity of V (µ).
  In the case when k = h is a Cartan subalgebra of g, there exists a classification
of simple (g, k)-modules of finite type, [M ], and in principle the results of the present

paper can be derived from the classification. For instance, for k = h, Theorem 3 claims
that a simple weight module of finite type M with generic minimal weight is a b-lowest
weight module, where the Borel subalgebra b = p is the minimal compatible parabolic
subalgebra of Theorem 3. Consequently, M is a highest weight module with respect to

the opposite Borel subalgebra (which contains h). Theorem 1 then becomes a statement
about the n-cohomology of maximal degree r = dim n, and via Poincaré-duality this is
equivalent to the obvious statement about the n-covariants of the simple highest weight
module. It seems however, that our genericity condition has not been previously singled

out as a sufficient condition for a simple weight module of finite type to be a lowest
(or highest) weight module. Finally, Theorem 4 does not follow from the classification
of simple weight modules of finite type, but in principle it could be derived from the
classification of all supports of simple weight modules of infinite type given in [DMP].
24                      IVAN PENKOV AND GREGG ZUCKERMAN

     The results of this paper are new in all cases when k is not a symmetric or a Cartan
subalgebra of g. As a simple illustration, we will conclude the paper by a brief discussion
of the case when k is an sℓ(2)-subalgebra.
                                                                                hα,ρi
     If k ≃ sℓ(2), then dim t = 1, and for any α ∈ ∆t , α = aρ, where a :=      kρk2
                                                                                        > 0.

Moreover, µ = ω + 2ρ⊥
                    n = mρ for m ∈ N, and the genericity condition is equivalent to

the single inequality

                                    hµ + 2ρ − ρn , ρi > 0,

or to the inequality

                                 dim V (µ) = m + 1 ≥ ρ̃(h),

where h is the semisimple element of the canonical sℓ(2)-basis e, f, h in k with h ∈
h (recall that ρ̃ := ρchh b ). The integer ρ̃(h) depends on the pair (g, k) and can be
computed in the following way.

     Write ρ̃ = Σri αi , where αi ∈ h∗ are the simple roots of b. The non-negative half-
integers ri are well-known, see [B]. Furthermore, a result of E. Dynkin, [D], states that

αi (h) ∈ {0, 1, 2}, and that k is a principal sℓ(2)-subalgebra if αi (h) = 2 for all i. The
final inequality equivalent to the genericity of V (µ) becomes

                                                      X
                             dim V (µ) = m + 1 ≥          αi (h)ri .
                                                      i


In particular, for a principal sℓ(2)-subalgebra it reads

                                                  X
(16)                                 m + 1 ≥ 2(       ri ).
                                                  i


     If g = sℓ(3) and k is a principal sℓ(2)-subalgebra, the pair (g, k) is nothing but the
symmetric pair (sℓ(3), so(3)) and (16) is the inequality


                                           m ≥ 3,
       GENERALIZED HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES WITH GENERIC MINIMAL k-TYPE                                25

which is well-known to be the necessary and sufficient condition for the first recon-
struction theorem to hold. If g = so(5) and k is a principal sℓ(2)-subalgebra, (16) is
equivalent to

                                              m ≥ 6,

and the case when m ≤ 5 is the “smallest” case when the problem of classifying all

simple (g, k)- modules of finite type is still open.
