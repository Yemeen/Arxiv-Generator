Introduction
   This is part one of a series of papers. In this series of papers, we consider prob-
lems analogous to the Oppenheim conjecture from the viewpoint of prehomogeneous
vector spaces.
   Throughout this paper, k is a eld of characteristic zero. The following theorem,
known as the Oppenheim conjecture, was proved by Margulis [19].
Theorem (0.1) (Margulis) Let Q be a real non-degenerate indenite2quadratic
form in n  3 variables. Suppose that the corresponding point in P(Sym (R n )) is
irrational. Then the set of values of Q at primitive integer points is dense in R .
   The above theorem for n  5 was conjectured by Oppenheim in [21]. Margulis
originally proved that values of Q at integer points can be arbitrarily small (non-
trivially of course), which implies that the set of values of Q at integer points
is dense in R due to the result of Lewis [18]. The above improved version (the
primitive part) is due to Dani{Margulis [8]. A further improvement of this result
was obtained by Borel{Prasad [4]. Some partial results were known prior to the
work of Margulis.
   Let f (x) be a degree d form in real n variables x = (x1;    ; xn). In the following,
we always assume that f is not a multiple of an integral form. Consider the following
questions.
(1) For any  > 0, does there exist x 2 Zn n f0g such that jf (x)j < ?
(2) For any  > 0, does there exist x 2 Zn n f0g such that 0 < jf (x)j < ?

(3) Is the set ff (x) j x 2 Zng dense in R ?
   For non-degenerate quadratic forms, one typically gets stronger results such as
(2) or (3). For forms of higher degree, there is no notion of \non-degenerate" forms.
However, for (1), this is not necessary. For example, if the form does not depend on
the variable x1, we may choose x1 = 1 and x2 =    = xn = 0. For non-degenerate
quadratic forms, the result of Lewis [18] implies that (2) implies (3).
   Oppenheim himself had partial results for quadratic forms in [22], [23]. For
example, he proved that if f is a non-degenerate indenite quadratic form in ve
or more variables and there exists x 2 Zn nf0g such that f (x) = 0, then (2) is true.
Chowla [5] proved (2) for indenite diagonal quadratic forms in nine variables.
Davenport and Heilbronn [12] proved (2) for indenite diagonal quadratic forms in
ve variables. Davenport with the collaboration of Birch and Rigout proved (2) for
indenite quadratic forms in 21 or more variables (see [9], [10], [11], [2], [30]). For
diagonal forms of degree d, Birch and Vaughan pointed out [3] that the method in
[12] applies to forms in 2d +1 variables. Davenport and Roth [13] proved a stronger
result that if d > 12, Cd log d variables are enough (C is a constant) and that if
d = 3, eight variables are enough. Also for non-diagonal forms in higher degree,
Schmidt [33] proved (1) for odd degree forms in enough variables. For example, for
cubic forms, (1314)256 variables are enough due to the result of Pitman [24]. Note
that the result of Lewis is for quadratic forms, and for generic odd degree forms in
suciently many variables, we still don't know whether or not (2) implies (3).
   The method of Davenport and others are based on the circle method, and the
method of Schmidt is somewhat more transcendental. However, the proof of Mar-
gulis is based on ergodic theory. What Margulis did was to prove the following
theorem for the case G = SL(3)R; U = SO(Q)R where Q is a non-degenerate
indenite quadratic form in three variables.
Theorem (0.2) (Ratner) Let G be a connected Lie group and U a connected
subgroup of G generated by unipotent elements of G. Then given any lattice  G
and x 2 G= , there exists a connected closed subgroup U  F  G such that
Ux = Fx . Moreover, F=F \ has a nite invariant measure.
   Note that in the above theorem, the denition of a lattice contains the condition
that G= has a nite volume. The rst statement was called Raghunathan's topo-
logical conjecture, and the second statement was proved by Ratner in conjunction
with Raghunathan's topological conjecture. Raghunathan's topological conjecture
was published by Dani [7] for one dimensional unipotent groups and was general-
ized to groups generated by unipotent elements by Margulis [19] (before Ratner's
proof). The proof for the general case was given by Ratner in a series of papers
[25], [26], [27], [28]. For these, there is an excellent survey article by Ratner [29].
   Note that in the above theorem, if G is an algebraic group over Q and is an
arithmetic lattice, the group F becomes an algebraic group dened over Q . For
this, the reader should see Proposition (3.2) [34, pp. 321{322]. it is also proved in
Proposition (3.2) [34, pp. 321{322] that the radical of F is a unipotent subgroup.
In [34], only one lattice is considered, but one can deduce the above statement
for any lattice commensurable with the lattice in [34] by a simple argument using
Ratner's theorem.
                                          2
    If we assume the above theorem, it is relatively easy to deduce the following
corollary, which will immediately imply Theorem (0.1).
Corollary (0.3) Let Q be a real quadratic form in three variables as in (0.1). Then
SO(Q)RSL(3)Z is dense in SL(3)R.
    Note that the representation V = Sym2 kn of G = GL(n) is an example of what
we call prehomogeneous vector spaces. We recall the denition of prehomogeneous
vector spaces.
Denition (0.4) Let G be a connected reductive group, V a representation of G,
and  a non-trivial character of G, all dened over k. Then (G; V; ) is called a
prehomogeneous vector space if it satises the following properties.
(1) There exists a Zariski open orbit.
(2) There exists a polynomial (x) 2 k[V ] such that (gx) = (g)a(x) for a
certain positive integer a.
    Such  is called a relative invariant polynomial. We dene V ss = fx 2 V j
(x) 6= 0g and call it the set of semi-stable points. If (G; V; ) is an irreducible
representation, the choice of  is essentially unique and we may write (G; V ) as
well. The theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces was initiated by Sato{Shintani
[32] and Shintani [35]. If (G; V ) is irreducible, the classication is known (see [31]).
For the zeta function theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces, see [36].
    Now we can generalize the Oppenheim conjecture from our viewpoint in the
following manner. For any algebraic group G, we denote the connected component
of 1 in Zariski topology by G0 . If G is dened over a subeld of R , we denote
the connected component of 1 of GR in classical topology by G0R+. Let (G; V ) be
an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space over Q . Let H = [G; G]  G be the
derived group. The group H is semi-simple. Let  HR0 + be a lattice. For x 2 VRss,
let Gx be the stabilizer and Hx = Gx \ H .
Question (0.5) (1) If x 2 VRss is suciently irrational, is Hx0R+ dense in HR0 +?
(2) If (1) is true, nd an explicit irrationality condition for (1) to be true.
    The Oppenheim conjecture can be considered as a special case of the above
question for G = GL(n); V = Sym2Q n . Suppose (G1 ; V1); (G2 ; V2) are prehomo-
geneous vector spaces,  : G1 ! G2 is a surjective homomorphism, and : V1 ! V2
is a linear map, equivariant with respect to . If G2x is nite for x 2 V2ss, Question
(0.5)(1) is obviously false for the prehomogeneous vector space (G1 ; V1). This elim-
inates cases (2) n = 2, (4), (8), (9), (11), (12), (28) in the classication (see [31,
pp. 144{147]). Let G; V; H be as before. We are interested in applying Ratner's
theorem and if the stabilizer Hx contains a split torus in its center, we cannot apply
Ratner's theorem. This applies to cases (15) m = 2, (17), (18), (26). This leaves
us twenty cases and one of them is case (2) n  3, which led to the Oppenheim
conjecture.
    For these twenty cases with the split k{form of G, H is either simple or a product
of two simple groups. Since we are considering only algebraic groups, the center of
each simple factor is nite. Consider x 2 VRss such that the projection of Hx0R to
each simple factor of HR has a positive rank. Note that if Hx0R is split, this condition
is satised (by case by case analysis). Then, by the Moore ergodicity theorem (see
                                           3
Theorem 1 [20, p. 161]), the action of Hx0R+ on HR0 += is ergodic (see (E) [20, p.
156] or [37, p. 8] for the denition of ergodicity). Therefore, by Proposition 2.1.7
[37, p. 10] for almost all h 2 HR0 += (meaning except for a measure zero set),
Hx0R+h is dense in HR0 += . This implies that Hh0 1 xR+ is dense in HR0 += . So
starting from x 2 VRss as above, the answer to Question (0.5)(1) is armative for
almost all points in the HR0 +{orbit of x.
   So in this series of papers, we consider Question (0.5)(2). In this paper, we
consider the prehomogeneous vector space G = GL(1)  GL(8); V = ^3 k8 . In part
two, we consider prehomogeneous vector spaces G = GL(1)  GL(n); V = ^3 kn
              0 1 G = GL(21n); V = ^2k2n.
for n = 6; 7, and
   Let H1 = @ 1            A. We dene

(0:6)            W0R = sl(3)R = fX 2 M(3; 3)R j tr(X ) = 0g;
                 W1R = su(H1 )R = fX 2 sl(3)C j H1 t X + XH1 = 0g:
These are Lie algebras dened over Q . We also dene
(0:7)           Q0(X ) = tr(X 2); F0 (X ) = det(X ) for X 2 W0R;
                                            p
                Q1(X ) = tr(X 2); F1 (X ) = 1 det(X ) for X 2 W1R:
Obviously Qi is a quadratic form and Fi is a cubic form on WiR. Our main result
of this paper is the following
Theorem (5.2) Let i = 0 or 1 and g 2 GL(Wi )R. Then if Qi (gX ) is an irrational
quadratic form in the sense of (0.1), the set of values of Fi (gX ) at primitive integer
points is dense in R .

x1 Invariant theory of the space ^3 k8
   Let G = GL(1)  GL(8); V = ^3 k8 , and Te = Ker(G ! GL(V )). It is easy to
see that
                    Te = f(t 3; tI8) j t 2 GL(1)g 
                                                  = GL(1):
This is the prehomogeneous vector space of type (7) in [31] also discussed in Igusa
[17].
   Even though this is known to be a prehomogeneous vector space, we have to
study the invariant theory of this space for our purposes.
   Let fe1;    ; e8 g be a basis of k8 . We use the notation ei1 ik = ei1 ^   ^ eik . It
is known [31, p. 88] that the orbit of the element
(1:1)             w = e123 + e456 + e7 ^ (e14 e25) + e8 ^ (e14 e36 )
is Zariski open in V .
                                               4
  Let                              00 I 0 1
                                = @ I3 0 0 A :

Igusa [17, p. 275] pointed out that there is a split exact sequence
(1:3)                     1 ! G0w =Te ! Gw =Te ! Z=2Z ! 1;
where  maps to the non-trivial element of Z=2Z and
(1:4)               G0w =Te 
                            = SL(3)=Z(SL(3))  = GL(3)=Z(GL(3));
                    Gw =Te = Aut (SL(3)) = Aut (GL(3));
where Z(GL(3)); Z(SL(3)) are the centers of GL(3); SL(3) respectively. Here we
interpret the quotient groups SL(3)=Z(SL(3)); GL(3)=Z(GL(3)) as those with uni-
versal categorical properties. In other words, if
       SL(3) = Spec R1; GL(3) = Spec R2 ; H1 = Z(SL(3)); H2 = Z(GL(3));
the ring of invariants R1H1 ; R2H2 are isomorphic. In this sense, SL(3)=Z(SL(3))    =
GL(3)=Z(GL(3)). The point is that k{rational points of this quotient come from
GL(3)k but may not come from SL(3)k .
    For any algebraic group G over k, let H1 (k; G) be the rst Galois cohomol-
ogy set. We choose the denition so that trivial classes are those of the form
fg 1g g2Gal(k=k)
                   (g 2 Gk ) and the cocycle condition is h = h h for a continu-
ous map fh g2Gal(k=k)
                          from Gal(k=k) to Gk .
    Note that by a similar argument as in [17], Gw   = GL(3)=Z(GL(3))  Te. Since
H (k; G) = H (k; Te) = f1g, the following theorem follows.

Theorem (1.5) (Sato{Kimura, Igusa)
             Gk n Vkss 
                       = H1(k; Aut (SL(3))) 
                                            = H1 (k; Aut (GL(3))):
  By the above theorem, the orbit space Gk n Vkss corresponds bijectively with the
set of k{isomorphism classes of k{forms of GL(3); SL(3). The correspondence is
that if x 2 Vkss, G0x =Te is isomorphic to the quotient of the corresponding k{form of
GL(3) modulo its center.
   The purpose of this section is to prove that we can associate a quadratic form
and a cubic form in eight variables to any x 2 Vkss. We rst describe how we can
identify G0w =Te with GL(3)=Z(GL(3)).
   Let W = sl(3) as in the introduction. We regard V = ^3 W . Let Eij be the
matrix whose only non-zero entry is the (i; j ){entry and is 1. We dene

We choose (e1;    ; e8 ) as the basis for W .
  Let i ; i ; i 2 k for i = 1; 2; 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 0. We put

(1:8)                 (ad(X )(e1);    ; ad(X )(e8)) = (e1 ;    ; e8)A:
   This matrix A is the one given in [31, p. 89]. Note that there is a misprint in
[31, p. 89] and the (3; 7); (8; 1){entries are supposed to be 3 ; 1. It is proved in
[31, p. 89] that if we regard w 2 ^3 W ,
                         G0w \ GL(W ) = fAd (g) j g 2 GL(3)g:
  As in [31], we dene a map D3 : ^3 W ! ^2 W 
 W by
(1:9)         D3 (v1 ^ v2 ^ v3 ) = v2 ^ v3 
 v1 v1 ^ v3

   For x 2 Vk , we dene
(1:10)             Sx = x(^;

 W;
where (^; 
) means the wedge product for the rst factor and the tensor product
for the second factor.
   Note that ^7 W 
 W 
 W    = W  
 (W 
 W ). So using the basis fe1 ;    ; e8g,
we can regard Sx as an 8  8 matrix with entries in the space of linear functions on
W . We identify W with the space of column vectors. It is easy to see that
(1:11)                       S(t;g)x (v) = t3 det ggSx(g 1v)tg
for v 2 W .
Denition (1.12) Px (v) = det Sx (v).
                                                6
   Clearly, Px (v) is bi-homogeneous of degree (24; 8). It is easy to see that
(1:13)                      Pgx(v) = t24 (det g)10Px (g 1v):
   Let

This is the element X00 considered in [31, p. 90].
   Let (f1 ;    ; f8) be the dual basis of (e1 ;    ; e8 ). We computed Sw ; Sw0 using
the software \MAPLE" [1]. For example, in order to compute Sw , we associate a
dierential form w = dx1 ^ dx2 ^ dx3 +    . In order to distinguish two D3 (w)'s,
we use variables x1 ;    ; x8 and y1 ;    ; y8. Then we type in the input as follows.

   If the output contains x1 y7 dx2 ^    ^ dx8 for example, we put f1 to the
(1; 7){entry of Sw . By interpreting the output of the above MAPLE session, Sw
turns out to be the following matrix

   We can easily compute det Sw (v); det Sw0 (v) by another MAPLE session as
follows.

  It turns out that
          Pw (v) = 1458Qw (v)Fw (v)2; Pw0 (v) = 1458Qw0 (v)Fw0 (v)2:
Proposition (1.16) (1) There exist polynomials Qx (v); Fx(v) over k such Qx (v) is
bi-homogeneous of degree (10; 2), Fx (v) is bi-homogeneous of degree (7; 3), Px (v) =
  1458Qx (v)Fx(v), and Qw (v); Fw (v) coincide with the ones in (1.15).
(2) Q(t;g)x(v) = t10(det g)4Qx (g 1v); F(t;g)x (v) = t7(det g)3Fx (g 1v).
Proof. We rst assume that k is algebraically closed. Let
                                  X = Spec k[V; W ]=(Px(v));
                                  Y = Spec k[W ]=(Pw (v)):
By (1.13), X is G{invariant. Let  : X ! V be the projection map. Let U = Gw.
Then U is a Zariski open subset.
                                              8
  Consider the following map
                 f : G=Gw  Y 3 (g; v) ! (gx; gv) 2  1 (U )  X:
Then f is set theoretically bijective to  1 (U ). Therefore, X is reducible.
  Let Px (v) = p(x)q(x; v) where q(x; v) is not divisible by a non-constant poly-
nomial in x. The above observation implies that q(x; v) is reducible. Since Pw (v)
does not have a linear factor, q(x; v) does not have a linear factor either. Since
Pw (v) is a product of a quadratic polynomial and two cubic polynomials, q(x; v)
cannot have a factor of degree four with respect to v. So it has a unique factor, say
Qx (v), of degree two with respect to v. Since Px (v) is bi-homogeneous, so is Qx (v).
Multiplying a constant if necessary, we may assume that Qw (v) coincides with the
one in (1.15).
  Let q(x; v) = Qx(v)r(x; v). Consider the projection map
                         : X1 = Spec k[V; W ]=(r(x; v)) ! V:
Then the ber over U does not have a reduced point. So by the generic smooth-
ness [14, p. 272], X1 cannot be irreducible. By considering the factorization
of Px (v), there exist two polynomials r1 (x; v); r2(x; v), cubic with respect to v,
such that r(x; v) = r1 (x; v)r2(x; v). Since Fw (v) is irreducible and the zero set of
r1 (x; v); r2(x; v) are the same generically, r1 (x; v) is irreducible and is a constant
multiple of r2(x; v). Multiplying a constant if necessary, there exists a polynomial,
say Fx (v), of degree three with respect to v such that r(x; v) = Fx (v)2 and Fw (v)
coincides with the one in (1.15). The polynomial Fx (v) is also bi-homogeneous.
    The discriminant of Qx (v) with respect to v is a relative invariant polynomial
and this reproves the existence of a relative invariant polynomial. Let a; b be the
degrees of Qx (v); Fx(v) with respect to x. Since Q(t;g)x(v); F(t;g)x(v) are the unique
quadratic and cubic factors of P(t;g)x(v), there exist integers c; d such that
         Q(t;g)x(v) = ta (det g)cQx (g 1v); F(t;g)x (v) = tb (det g)dFx (g 1v):
This implies that if p(x) is not constant, it is a relative invariant polynomial.
However, Pw0 (v) is a non-zero polynomial and the discriminant of Qw0 (v) is zero.
So p(x) must be a constant. By considering the point w, this constant must be
  1458. Obviously a + 2b = 24 and c + 2d = 10. By considering scalar matrices,
3a = 8c 2; 3b = 8d 3. This system of linear equations has a unique solution
a = 10; b = 7; c = 4; d = 3.
   Now we consider an arbitrary eld k of characteristic zero. If  2 Gal(k=k),
by the uniqueness of the quadratic and cubic factors of Px (v), Qx (v) and Fx (v)
must be constant multiples of Qx (v) and Fx (v) respectively. By considering the
point w, these constants must be 1. So Qx (v) and Fx (v) are Galois group invariant
and therefore are polynomials over k (ch k = 0). This proves the proposition. 
   If x 2 V ss, Qx is non-degenerate. We dene
(1:17)              Qx (v; v0) = 21 (Qx (v + v0 ) Qx(v) Qx (v0)):
                                           9
   By this paring, we get a map ix : W ! W . This induces a map
(1:18)                               jx : ^3 W ! ^3 W  :
We dene
(1:19)                               x = jx (x) 2 ^3 W  :
   Let fijk = fi ^ fj ^ fk , etc. Easy computations show that
(1:20)    w = f123 f456 f7 ^ (f14 2f25 + f36) f8 ^ (f14 + f25 2f36):

Proposition (1.21) For (t; g) 2 G, j(t;g)x(v) = t30(det g)12gjx (g 1v). In particu-
lar, (t;g)x = t31(det g)12gx.
Proof. If (t; g) 2 G,
                         Q(t;g)x (v; v0) = t10(det g)4Qx (g 1v; g 1v0)
for all v; v0 2 W . So
                         i(t;g)x (v)(v0) = t10 (det g)4ix (g 1v)(g 1v0 ):
Considering the induced map on ^3 W , j(t;g)x(v) = t30(det g)12gjx (g 1v). This
proves the proposition. 
   The following proposition is an intuitive interpretation of Qw ; Fw . The proof is
left to the reader.
Proposition (1.22) For X; Y; Z 2 W ,
                                    Qw (X; Y ) = tr(XY );
                                    Fw (X ) = det X:

x2 The xed point set of Hx0
   Throughout this section, we assume that k is algebraically closed. For our pre-
homogeneous vector space (G; V ), H = SL(W ). We consider the xed point set of
Hx0 in this section.
Proposition (2.1) If x 2 Vkss and y 2 Vk is xed by Hxk0 , y is a scalar multiple of
x.
Proof. We rst consider the case x = w.
Lemma (2.2) If y 2 Vk is xed by Hwk  0 , y is a scalar multiple of w .

Proof. As we pointed out in x1, Hk0  = SL(3)k =Z (SL(3)k ) (since k is algebraically
closed). Also as a representation of SL(3), W is the adjoint representation, which
has the weight 1 + 2. So we only have to show that ^3 W contains the trivial
                                               10
representation of SL(3) precisely once. We can verify this by the software \LIE"
[6] as follows.
  >   setdefault A2
  >   alt tensor(3,[1,1])

  The result is
                                   ^3 W = U1  U2  U3  U4
where U1 is the trivial representation and U2 ; U3; U4 are irreducible representations
with highest weights 32 ; 1 + 2 ; 31 respectively. This proves the lemma. 
   We now consider the general case. Suppose x = gx w for gx 2 Gk . Then Hxk     0 =
gx Hwk
    0 g 1 . So g 1 y is xed by H 0 . This implies that g 1 y is a scalar multiple of
        x       x                  wk                       x
w. Therefore, y is a scalar multiple of gx w = x. 
Corollary (2.3) If y 2 ^3 Wk is xed by Hwk
                                           0 , y is a scalar multiple of  .
                                                                          w
Proof. Suppose y 2 ^3 W  is xed by Hwk
                                       0 . Let z = j 1 (y ). Since H 0  SL(W ),
                                                     w               w

                  y = jw (z) = jgw (z) = gjw (g 1z) = gy = gjw (z)
for g 2 Hw0 . So z is xed by Hwk 0 . By Lemma (2.2), z is a scalar multiple of w .
Therefore, y is a scalar multiple of w . 
x3 Lie algebra structures on W
   In this section we construct Lie algebra structures on W depending on x 2 Vkss.
   For X; Y; Z 2 Hom(W; W ) = W  
 W , we dene
(3:1)                        B (X; Y ) = tr(XY );
                             C (X; Y; Z ) = tr(XY Z ZY X );
                             [X; Y ] = XY Y X:
B is a symmetric bilinear form and C is an alternating tri-linear form. It is known
[31, p. 90] that our prehomogeneous vector space has a relative invariant (x) of
degree 16 and therefore ((t; g)x) = t16(det g)6(x) for (t; g) 2 G. Since we are
assuming ch k = 0, we may assume that  2 k[V ] and (w) = 1. For x 2 Vkss, let
hx be the Lie algebra of Hx .
                              0

Proposition (3.2) Let x 2 Vkss. Then there exists a unique k{linear isomorphism
lx : W ! hx satisfying the following conditions
(1) lx(Av) = [A; lx(v)] for all A 2 hx ; v 2 W ,
(2) B (lx(v); lx(v0 )) = 6Qx (v; v0) for all v; v0 2 W ,
(3) (x)C (lx(v); lx(v0 ); lx(v00 )) = 6x (v; v0; v00 ) for all v; v0; v00 2 W .
Proof. We rst consider the case x = w. Let
(3:3)          (; ;  ) = (v7 + v8 ; 2v7 + v8 ; v1 ; v2; v3 ; v4; v5; v6 );
                  X
                  8
             lw (         vi ei ) = A(; ;  );
                    i=1

                                                   11
where AP
       (; ;  ) is as in (1.7). Then A(; ;  ) is the matrix representation of ad(v)
for v = 8i=1 vi ei . Therefore, B is the Killing form and (2) is well known. Since
        C (lw (v); lw (v0 ); lw (v00 )) = tr(ad(v)ad(v0 )ad(v00 ) ad(v00 )ad(v0 )ad(v));
this is an element of ^3 W  , xed by Hw0 k . So C is a scalar multiple of w by
Corollary (2.3). Let Ai = lw (ei ) for i = 1; 2; 3. We used MAPLE again to compute
C (A1; A2; A3) and the result was C (A1; A2; A3) = 6. Since w (e1 ; e2; e3 ) = 1,
C (lw (v); lw (v0 ); lw (v00)) = 6w (v; v0; v00 ) for all v; v0; v00 2 W . So we get (3).
   Let [ ; ]w be the Lie bracket for W = sl(3). Since lw (v) is the matrix represen-
tation of ad(v) and [ad(v); ad(v0)] = ad([v; v0]w ) for v; v0 2 W ,
(3:4)                    lw (v)v0 = [v; v0]w ;
                         [lw (v); lw (v0)] = lw ([v; v0]w ) = lw (lw (v)v0):
Since lw is an linear isomorphism, any A 2 hw is of the form A = lw (v0 ). So (1)
follows from the second equality in (3.4).
   Suppose l : W ! hw is another map satisfying (1){(3). Then there exists an
element g 2 GL(W ) such that l(v) = lw (gv). By (1), lw (gAv) = [A; lw (gv)] for all
A 2 hw ; v 2 W . Let v0 = lw 1(A). Then since l(v) also satises (1), by (3.4),
             lw (g[v0; v]w ) = lw (glw (v0 )v) = [lw (v0); lw (gv)] = lw ([v0; gv]w ):
This is equivalent to
                                  g[v0; v]w = [v0; gv]w
for all v; v0 2 W . So g commutes with the adjoint representation, which is irre-
ducible. So by Schur's lemma, g is a scalar matrix and l(v) = clw (v) for a non-zero
constant c. Since both lw ; l satisfy properties (2), (3), c2 = c3 = 1. Therefore,
c = 1. This proves the uniqueness.
   Now we consider arbitrary x 2 Vkss. We rst assume that k is algebraically
closed. So we choose h 2 GL(W )k so that x = hw. Let lx : W ! hx be any linear
isomorphism. Let
                           lx0 (v) = (det h) 2 h 1 lx (hv)h:
We show that the conditions (1){(3) are equivalent to the following conditions
(3:5)       lx0 ((h 1 Ah)h 1 v) = [h 1 Ah; lx0 (h 1 v)];
            B (lx0 (h 1 v); lx(h 1 v0 )) = 6Qw (h 1 v; h 1v0 );
            C (lx0 (h 1 v); lx0 (h 1 v0 ); lx0 (h 1 v00 )) = 6w (h 1 v; h 1 v0 ; h 1v00 ):
   The equivalence of the rst equations is straightforward. By the denition of lx0 ,
        B (lx(v); lx(v0 )) = (det h)4 B (hlx0 (h 1 v)h 1 ; hlx0 (h 1 v0 )h 1 )
                               = (det h)4 B (lx0 (h 1 v); lx0 (h 1 v0 ));
C (lx (v); lx(v0); lx0 (v00 )) = (det h)6 C (hlx0 (h 1 v)h 1 ; hlx0 (h 1 v0 )h 1 ; hlx0 (h 1 v00 )h 1 )
                               = (det h)6 C (lx0 (h 1 v); lx0 (h 1 v0 ); lx0 (h 1 v00 )):
                                                  12
   By Propositions (1.16)(2), (1.21),
                     Qx (v; v0) = (det h)4 Qw (h 1 v; h 1v0 );
                  x (v; v0; v00 ) = (det h)12w (h 1 v; h 1v0 ; h 1 v00 ):
Since (x) = (det h)6 (w) = (det h)6 , the equivalences of the second and the third
equations follow.
   Since A 2 hx is equivalent to h 1 Ah 2 hw , lw is the unique element which
satises (3.5). Therefore, such lx exists and
(3:6)                        lx (v) = (det h)2 hlw (h 1 v)h 1 :
   Now we consider arbitrary k. By the previous step, there exists a k{linear
isomorphism lx : Wk ! hxk satisfying (1){(3). Since (x) and forms B; Qx; C; x
are all dened over k, for any Galois group element , lx satises (1){(3) also.
Because of the uniqueness, lx = lx for all  2 Gal(k=k). Therefore, lx is dened
over k. 
Corollary (3.7) Let x 2 Vkss. Then , lx (gv) = glx(v)g 1 for all g 2 Hx0; v 2 W .
Proof. Let F = fg 2 Hx0 j lx (gv) = glw (v)g 1 for all v 2 W g. Then F is an
algebraic subgroup of Hx0 . The tangent space of F at g = 1 is a subspace of hx
dened by the equation (3.2)(1) for all v. So the tangent space of F at g = 1 is hx .
Since ch k = 0, F must be Hx0 . 
Denition (3.8) Let x = hw 2 Vkss where h 2 GL(W )k . For v; v0 2 Wk and
A 2 hwk , we dene
(1) [v; v0]x = lx 1([lx (v); lx(v0 )]),
(2) mx;h(v) = (det h) 2 hv,
(3) nx;h(A) = hAh 1 .
    It is easy to see that [v; v0]x denes a Lie algebra structure on W dened over
k and lx induces a Lie algebra isomorphism from W to hx . By Proposition (3.3),
Qx ; Fx can be regarded as functions on hx and Qx is 16 times the Killing form of
hx .

Proposition (3.9) (1) mx;h ([v; v0]w ) = [mx;h(v); mx;h(v0)]x for all v; v0 2 Wk and
therefore is a Lie algebra isomorphism.
(2) The following diagram is commutative.
                                            mx;h
                                        Wk  ! Wk

                                           nx;h
Proof.
                  lx (mx;h ([v; v0]w )) = lx ((det h) 2 h[v; v0]w )
                                        = hlw ([v; v0]w )h 1
                                        = h[lw (v); lw (v0)]h 1
                                        = [hlw (v)h 1 ; hlw (v0)h 1 ]
                                        = [lx(mx;h (v)); lx(mx;h (v0))]:
                                           13
Note that we used (3.4) in the third step. This proves (1). The proof of statement
(2) is straightforward. 
   It is possible to use mx;h to dene a Lie algebra structure on W and we don't
need det h for that purpose. However, in order to dene a map lx compatible with
the group action, we need the factor (det h)2. In Proposition (3.2), we used the
relative invariant of degree 16. But we could have used the discriminant 1 (x) of
Qx (v) also. In that case since it is a relative invariant of degree 80, we use the
condition
                   1 (x)C (lx(v); lx(v0); lx(v00 ))5 = 65x (v; v0; v00 )5 :
Since 2 and 15 are relatively prime, the proof still works.
   For the rest of this section, we assume k = R and we describe the orbit space
GR n VRss 
          = GL(W )R n VRss. Let X , etc. be the complex conjugate and  2 Gal(C =R )
the corresponding Galois group element, i.e. X  = X .
   Since SL(3) is a simply connected algebraic group,
                                   Aut SL(3) 
                                             = Aut sl(3):
So instead of R {forms of SL(3), we consider R {forms of sl(3). It is well known
that R {forms of sl(3) are isomorphic to sl(3) or su(H ) where H is either one of the
following two Hermitian matrices
                          01                    1        01  1
                     H1 = @ 1                   A ; H2 = @ 1 A :
                                            1                 1
We dene an R {involution of sl(3)C by pH (X ) = H t XH 1 . Then
(3:10)                   su(H ) = fX 2 sl(3)C j pH (X ) = X g:
   If x = hw for h 2 GC , the corresponding cohomology class cx = H1 (R ; Aut sl(3))
consists of a single element h 1 h = h 1 h 2 Aut sl(3)C . Therefore, the correspond-
ing R {form is
(3:11)                   hx   
                              = fX 2 sl(3)C j h 1 h(X ) = X g:
So if we can nd h such that pH (X ) = h 1 h(X ), the R {orbit of x = hw corresponds
to su(H ). 0                1

                      i
(3:12)                                                          1Di p

Note that qD2 i = I8; Hi2 = I3 .
                                                 14
   It is easy to see that qDi X = Hi t XHi 1. In other words, qDi is the matrix
representation of the involution X ! Hi t XHi 1 (this is not pH ). Also qDi =
hD1i hDi for i = 1; 2. Therefore, GR n VRss is represented by w0 = w; w1 = hD1 w; w2 =
hD2 w. Easy computations show that
(3:13) w1 = 2(e123 e156 + e246 e345 + e7 ^ (e14 + e25 ) + e8 ^ (e14 + e36 ));
       w2 = 2(e123 e156 + e246 e345 + e7 ^ (e14 e25 ) + e8 ^ (e14 e36 )):
Lemma (3.14) For i = 1; 2, qDi lw (X )qDi1 = lw (pHi (x)).
Proof. If Y 2 W ,
                     qDi lw (X )qDi1Y = Hi t [X; Hit Y Hi 1]w Hi 1
                                      = Hi [Hi 1 Y Hi ; tX ]w Hi 1
                                      = [Y; Hit XHi 1 ]w
                                      = [pHi (X ); Y ]w
                                      = lw (pHi (X ))Y:
Therefore, qDi lw (X )qDi1 = lw (pHi (x)). 
  Since hwi C = hDi hwC hD1i for i = 1; 2, Elements of hwiC can be written as
hDi lw (X )hD1i for X 2 sl(3)C . We consider when this element belongs to hwiR.
Proposition (3.15) For i = 1; 2,
                   fhD1i X j X 2 WRg = su(Hi )R  sl(3)C ;
                   fhD1i X j X 2 WQ g = su(Hi )Q  sl(3)Q(p 1) :
Proof. Since hDi = hDi qDi ,
                       hDi lw (X )hD1i = hDi qDi lw (X )qDi1hD1i
                                       = hDi lw (pHi (X ))hD1i :
Note that there is a natural Q {structure on su(Hi ). Therefore,
(3:16)                hwi R = fhDi lw (X )hD1i j X 2 su(Hi )Rg;
                      hwi Q = fhDi lw (X )hD j X 2 su(Hi )Q g:
                                             1

                                          p
   It is easy to see that det hDi = 8 1 and (det hDi )2 = 64 2 Q for i =
1; 2. Since lx is dened over any ground eld of characteristic zero, lx (WR) =
hxR ; lx (WQ ) = hxQ . Since the diagram (3.9)(2) commutes,


           fhD1i X j X 2 WRg = mx;h1 Di (WR) = su(Hi )R  sl(3)C ;
           fhD1i X j X 2 WQ g = mx;h1 Di (WQ ) = su(Hi )Q  sl(3)Q(p 1) :
                                          15
   This proves the proposition. 
   By Proposition (1.16)(3),
(3:17)                       Qwi (X ) = 212 Qw (hD1i X );

                             Fwi (X ) = 29 1Fw (hD1i X ):
So if we identify WR 
                     = su(Hi )R,
                                                          p
(3:18)             Qwi (X ) = 212tr(X 2); Fwi (X ) = 29        1 det(X ):
Note that if X 2 su(Hi)R, tr(X 2) 2 R and det(X ) is purely imaginary.
  It is easy to see that

for i = 1; 2. Easy computations show that
(3:20) Qw1 (v) = 211( v12 + v22 + v32 v42 + v52 + v62 4v72 + 4v7v7 4v82 );
       Qw2 (v) = 211( v12 v22 v32 v42 v52 v62 4v72 + 4v7v7 4v82 ):
   So if x 2 GRwi , the signature of Qx (v) is (5; 3) or (3:5), (4; 4), (0; 8) or (8; 0) for
i = 0; 1; 2 respectively. This should be the case because these are constant multiples
of the Killing forms of sl(3); su(H1); su(H2) respectively.
x4 Intermediate groups
   Let h1 = sl(3); h2 = sl(h1 ); h3 = so(Qw ). In this section, we consider Lie
subalgebras of h2 containing h1.
   First we assume that the ground eld k is algebraically closed. For a simple Lie
algebra f of rank n, let 1;    ; n be the fundamental weights of f as in [31, pp.
7{32]. Let d() be the dimension of the irreducible representation with highest
weight . The adjoint representation of h1 is the irreducible representation with
highest weight 1 + 2 . This implies that its dual is equivalent to itself. So as
a representation of h1 , h2 plus the trivial representation is equivalent to h1 
 h1 .
We used LIE again to nd the irreducible decomposition of this representation as
follows.
   >    setdefault A2
   >    tensor([1,1],[1,1])

   The result is that after eliminating the trivial representation, h2 decomposes into
a sum of ve representations as follows

(4:1)                        h2   = U1  U2  U3  U4  U5:
                                            16
where U1 = h1 and the highest weights of U2 ; U3; U4; U5 are 1 +2 ; 31; 32; 21 +
22 respectively. We can also nd the dimensions of the representations as follows.
  >     dim([2,2]),   etc.
  The result is the following.

(4:2)            dim U2 = 8; dim U3 = dim U4 = 10; dim U5 = 27:
   Since h1  h3 and dim h3 = 28, h3 = U1  U3  U4.
Proposition (4.3) Suppose k is algebraically closed. Then if h1  f  h2 is a Lie
subalgebra, f = h1 ; h2 or h3 .
Proof. Suppose f 6= h1 ; h2. Then possible dimensions for f are

For simple Lie algebras of type An ; Bn; Cn ; Dn , the smallest non-trivial representa-
tion is the standard representation. The following table is the list of the dimensions

  Lie algebras f of types An {Dn such that dim f  55 are the following

  Cn : 10(n = 2); 21; 36; 55,
  Dn : 28(n = 4); 45.
   Suppose f is simple. Then the only possibilities are A3; A5; B5; D4; D5 ; F4; G2.
Since h1  f  h2 and h1 is an irreducible eight dimensional representation of h1, f
has an irreducible eight dimensional representation. By the above table, this is not
possible for B5 ; C5; F4. If dim f = 28, the only possibility is f = U1  U3  U4 = h3 .

   P f is of type A3. If the highest weight of a representation is  =
  Suppose
and  m  2, d() is at least
                                                                                        


                        d(21) = d(23) = 10; d(1 + 3 ) = 15;
                        d(1 + 2 ) = d(2 + 3 ) = d(22) = 20
(we used LIE again). So this cannot happen. Since d(1 ) = d(3 ) = 4; d(2) = 6,
f does not have an irreducible eight dimensional representation. Similarly, f cannot
be of type A5 or G2 .
   Suppose f is semi-simple but not simple. Let f = f0  f00 , f0 simple, and f00
semi-simple. Then the eight dimensional irreducible representation of f is a tensor
product of irreducible representations V 0 ; V 00 of f0 ; f00 . Since f0 is simple, there is only
one one dimensional representation, which is the trivial representation. If V 0 is the
trivial representation, f0 acts trivially on h1, which is a contradiction. Therefore,
any simple factor of f has an irreducible representation of dimension either two or
four. The only such possibilities are type A1 dimension 2 or 4, type A3 dimension
4, or type C2 dimension 4. So the only possibilities for f are
                    sl(2)  sl(2)  sl(2); sl(2)  sl(4); sl(2)  sp(4):
Then dim f = 9; 18; 13. The rst and the third cases cannot happen. Suppose f =
sl(2)  sl(4). Since sl(3) does not have a non-trivial two dimensional representation,
sl(4) alone contains sl(3). Since dim f cannot be 15, this cannot happen.
   Suppose f is reductive. By Schur's lemma, the center of f must act trivially (there
are no scalar matrices in h2 except for the zero matrix). But this is a contradiction.
Therefore, the only proper reductive subalgebra of h2 containing h1 is h3 .
   It is known ([16, p. 187]) that any maximal proper connected subgroup of a
reductive group is either reductive or parabolic. Therefore, any maximal proper
subalgebra of a reductive Lie algebra is either reductive or parabolic. Suppose
h1  f  h3 . If f 6= h1 ; h3 , we choose f so that it is maximal in h3 . Since we already
proved that there is no such reductive subalgebra, f must be a parabolic subalgebra
of h3 . Then the reductive part of f must be h1. This is a contradiction because the
rank of the Cartan subalgebra of h3 is four, but the rank of the Cartan subalgebra
of h1 is three. So there is no proper subalgebra between h1 and h3 .
   If f is not contained in h3, choose a maximal proper subalgebra f  f0  h2 . Then
 0                                                                    0
f must be a parabolic subalgebra of h2 . The reductive part of f contains h1 and it
must be either h1 or h3 . Again this is a contradiction by considering the ranks of
the Cartan subalgebras. 

By Proposition (4.3), g 1fC g 1 = hwC ; so(Qw )C , or sl(W )C . This implies that fC is
hxC ; so(Qx )C , or sl(W )C . So f = fC \ sl(W )R = hxR ; so(Qx )R or sl(W )R .
   Since the correspondence between connected closed subgroups and Lie subalge-
bras is one-to-one, this proves the corollary. 

x5 An analogue of the Oppenheim conjecture
    We prove our main theorem in this section.
Theorem (5.1) Let  SL(W )R be an arithmetic lattice and x 2 VRss Suppose
Qx (v) is indenite and irrational in the sense of (0.1). Then Hx0R+ is dense in
SL(W )R.
Proof. Since Qx (v) is indenite, G0xR is not compact and is generated by unipotent
elements. Therefore, by Ratner's theorem, there exists a connected closed subgroup
Hx0R+  F  SL(W )R such that Hx0R+ = F . As we pointed out in the introduc-
tion, F is dened over Q . By Corollary (4.6), F = Hx0R+; SO(Qx )R, or SL(W )R.
We prove that the rst two cases cannot happen.
    Suppose F = Hx0R+. Let  2 Aut (C =Q ). Since F is dened over Q , (Hx0C ) =
Hx0 C = Hx0C . So Hx0C xes x . By Proposition (2.1), x must be a scalar multiple
of x. So x denes a Q {rational point in P(V )R. However, by the map x ! Qx , it
corresponds to the class of Qx in P(Sym2W  )R. Since this map is dened over Q ,
it is a Q {rational point, and this is a contradiction.
    Suppose F = SO(Qx )R. Then for any  2 Aut (C =Q ),
                       SO(Qx )C = (SO(Qx )C ) = SO(Qx)C :
So SO(Qx )C xes Qx . Then it is well known that Qx is a scalar multiple of Qx . So
the class of Qx is a Q {rational point of P(Sym2W  ), which is a contradiction. 
   Consider Qi (X ); Fi (X ) in the introduction for i = 0; 1.
Theorem (5.2) Let i = 0 or 1 and g 2 GL(Wi )R. Then if Qi (gx) is an irrational
quadratic form in the sense of (0.1), the set of values of Fi (gx) at primitive integer
points is dense in R .
Proof. Let x = g 1wi where g 2 GR and i = 0 or 1. By Proposition (1.16)(2),
               Qx (v) = (det g) 4Qwi (gv); Fx (v) = (det g) 3Fwi (gv):
   So Qx(v) is irrational if and only if Qwi (gv) is irrational. fFx (v) j v 2 WZg is
dense in R if and only if fFwi (gv) j v 2 WZg is dense in R . Since the argument is
similar, we only consider the case i = 1. Note that Qw1 (X ) = 212Q1(X ); Fw1 (X ) =
29 F1(X ). However, these constants have no eect on the statement.
                                              19
   We use the identication WQ   = su(H1)Q . Let L  WQ be the lattice which
corresponds to su(H1 )Z by this identication. We dene
(5:3)                              = fh 2 SL(W )R j hL  Lg:
This is an arithmetic lattice in SL(W )R.
Lemma (5.4) For any real number r, there exists h 2 SL(W )R and an primitive
element u 2 L such that Fh 1x (u) = r.
Proof. We may assume x = w1 for a certain non-zero real number . Then
                          Fh 1x (v) = 7 Fh       1 w1   (v) = 7 Fw1 (hv):
So Fh 1x (u) = r is equivalent to Fw1 (hu) =  7 r. Replacing r if necessary, we may
assume  =1 1. Choose a Z{basis (u1;    ; u8) of L so that Fw1 (u1 ) = s 6= 0. Let
t = (rs 1) 3 . Then
                          (u1;    ; u8) ! (tu1; t 71 u2 ;    ; t 17 u8 )
induces an element h of SL(W )R. Clearly, Fw1 (hu1 ) = r. 
   For h in the above lemma, we choose h1 2 Hx0R; h2 2 so that h1 h2 is close to
h. Then
                F(h1 h2 ) 1 x (u) = Fh2 1 h1 1x (u) = Fh2 1x (u) = Fx (h2 (u))
is close to Fx (hu). Since h2 2 , h2 (u) 2 L is a primitive point also. This proves
Theorem (5.2). 
Remark (5.5) Consider the situation in Theorem (5.2). A simple modication of
the above proof shows a slightly stronger statement as follows.
   Let i = 0; 1. For any r1;    ; r7 2 R and  > 0, There exists a Z{basis
(u1;    ; u8) of WiR such that jFi (guj ) rj j <  for j = 1;    ; 7.
