                                                   Abstract. This paper is concerned with representations of split orthogonal and
                                                   quasi-split unitary groups over a nonarchimedean local field which are not generic,
                                                   but which support a unique model of a different kind, the generalized Bessel model.
                                                   The properties of the Bessel models under induction are studied, and an analogue of
                                                   Rodier’s theorem concerning the induction of Whittaker models is proved for Bessel
                                                   models which are minimal in a suitable sense. The holomorphicity in the induction
                                                   parameter of the Bessel functional is established. Last, local coefficients are defined
                                                   for each irreducible supercuspidal representation which carries a Bessel functional
                                                   and also for a certain component of each representation parabolically induced from
                                                   such a supercuspidal.




                                             Introduction. L-functions are a central object of study in representation theory
                                             and number theory. Over a global field, one has the Langlands Conjectures, which
                                             assert in particular the meromorphic continuation and functional equation of a
                                             class of Euler products. Over a local field one has additional conjectures due to
                                             Langlands, expressing the Plancherel measure arithmetically as the ratio of certain
                                             local L-functions and root numbers.
                                                In many cases these conjectures have been established by Shahidi [Shab,Shac,
                                             Shad], following a path laid out by Langlands [Lana]. The framework for Shahidi’s
                                             work is the study of Eisenstein series or their local analogues, induced represen-
                                             tations. One knows the continuation of these Eisenstein series due to Langlands
                                             [Lanb]. Langlands also showed that the constant coefficients of the Eisenstein se-
                                             ries may be expressed in terms of local intertwining operators which are almost
                                             everywhere quotients of certain L-functions. It remains to study these intertwining
                                             operators for the finite set of ‘bad’ places. If the inducing data is generic, that is,
                                             admits a Whittaker model, then Shahidi has succeeded in relating them to local
                                             L-functions. Thus the careful study of the Eisenstein series, both local and global,
                                             affords a proof of certain of the Langlands conjectures for these L-functions.
                                                The aim of this work is to suggest that the Langlands-Shahidi method may be
                                             extended beyond the generic spectrum by the use of other models. The Whittaker
                                             model is unique (an irreducible admissible representation admits at most one such
                                             model up to scalars). In this paper we study the properties of local representations
                                             of split orthogonal groups and quasi-split unitary groups which are not generic, but

which support a unique model of a different kind, the generalized Bessel model.
These models involve a character of a proper subgroup of the unipotent radical
of a Borel subgroup, but transform under a reductive group of some, in general
non-zero, rank. The uniqueness of the models has been proved by S. Rallis [Ral]
in the orthogonal case, but as the argument has not yet been written out in full
detail in the unitary case we make it a hypothesis throughout the paper.
   We first study the properties of Bessel models under induction, and prove an ana-
logue of Rodier’s Theorem [Rodb] concerning the induction of Whittaker models.
Our analogue, Theorem 2.1, states that if one parabolically induces a representa-
tion with a Bessel model of minimal rank, or more generally one which is minimal
in the sense of Definition 1.5 below, then the induced representation has a unique
Bessel model of the same rank and compatible type. In the case of rank 0, we
recover Rodier’s theorem. To carry out the proof we use Bruhat’s extension [Bru]
of Mackey theory and investigate precisely which double cosets of the appropriate
type may support a functional with the desired equivariance property. We show
that there is a unique such double coset by an extensive combinatorial argument.
   Next, we establish the holomorphicity of the Bessel functional which arises from
one which is minimal by parabolic induction of the underlying representation. Our
approach is based on Bernstein’s theorem [Ber], which uses uniqueness to conclude
meromorphicity under some regularity hypotheses, and Banks’s extension [Ban],
which allows one to prove holomorphicity as well. We show in Theorem 3.6 that
there is a non-zero Bessel functional Λ(ν, π), attached to an irreducible admissible
representation π of the Levi subgroup M and a parameter ν in the complexified
dual of the Lie algebra of the split component of M , which is holomorphic in ν.
   If π is supercuspidal and has a Bessel model, or more generally if π is irre-
ducible and carries a Bessel model corresponding to a minimal Bessel model of
the supercuspidal from which it is induced, these results allow us to establish the
existence of a local coefficient. In the generic case, such a local coefficient was cru-
cial for Shahidi’s study of the intertwining operators and of the relation between
Plancherel measures and L–functions; see Shahidi [Shad]. Let A(ν, π, w) denote
the standard intertwining operator attached to inducing data ν, π and Weyl group
element representative w (see (3.4) below). We shall prove (cf. Theorem 3.8):
Theorem. Let π be an irreducible representation of M which is a component of
the representation parabolically induced from an irreducible admissible supercuspidal
representation ρ of a parabolic subgroup of M. Suppose that π carries a Bessel model
corresponding (in the sense of Theorem 2.1) to a minimal Bessel model of ρ. For
each w̃ in the Weyl group, choose a representative w for w̃. Then there is a complex
number C(ν, π, w) so that
                      Λ(ν, π) = C(ν, π, w)Λ(w̃ν, w̃π)A(ν, π, w).
Moreover, the function ν 7→ C(ν, π, w) is meromorphic and depends only on the
class of π and the choice of the representative w.
   We call C(ν, π, w) the local coefficient attached to π, ν, and w. We then show
in Corollary 3.9 that the local coefficients behave as expected with respect to the
Langlands decomposition of the intertwining operators. This generalizes a property
of the local coefficients introduced by Shahidi [Shaa] in the generic case.

§1 Preliminaries on Bessel Models. In this section we recall the notion of
a Bessel model following [Ral] and [GPR], and review some properties of such
models. Let F be a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero. Let G be
one of the classical groups SO2r+1 , U2r+1 , U2r , or SO2r , defined over F. We assume
that the orthogonal groups are split, and that the unitary groups are quasi-split,
and split over a quadratic extension E/F. Let r0 = 2r if G = U2r or SO2r , and
r0 = 2r + 1 otherwise. Denote by B = TU the Borel subgroup of G, where T
contains the maximal split subtorus of diagonal elements, and U is the subgroup
of upper triangular unipotent matrices in G. We use G to denote the F -rational
points of G, and use this notational convention for other algebraic groups defined
over F.
    Denote by Φ(G, T) the root system of G with respect to T. We choose the
ordering on the roots corresponding to our choice of Borel subgroup. Let W =
W (G, Td ) be the Weyl group of G with respect to the maximal split subtorus Td
of T. Thus, W = NG (Td )/T. Then,
                                  Sr ⋉ Zr2     if G 6= SO2r
                               
                         W ≃             r−1
                                  Sr ⋉ Z2      if G = SO2r .
(See [Gola,Golb] for a more explicit description of T and W.) Here we will denote
all elements of W as permutations on r0 letters. Thus, the permutation (ij) ∈ Sr
corresponds to the permutation (ij)(r0 + 1 − j r0 + 1 − i) in Sr0 . Similarly, the
sign change ci which generates that i-th copy of Z2 corresponds to the permutation
(i r0 + 1 − i) in Sr0 .
    Fix an ℓ < r and let ℓ0 = r0 − 2ℓ. Let Uℓ be the subgroup of U consisting of
matrices whose middle ℓ0 ×ℓ0 block is the identity matrix. For 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ, let ψi be a
non-trivial additive character of F if G is orthogonal, and let ψi be the composition
of such a character with T rE/F if G is unitary. We let a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , aℓ0 ) ∈ F ℓ0
if G is orthogonal, and let a ∈ E ℓ0 if G is unitary. Then define ψℓ,aj by ψℓ,aj (x) =
ψℓ (aj x). Now define a character of Uℓ by
                                     ℓ−1
                                     Y                    ℓ0
                                                          Y
                      χ ((uij )) =         ψi (ui,i+1 )         ψℓ,aj (uℓ,ℓ+j ).

Note that Mℓ ⊂ NG (Uℓ ). If g ∈ Mℓ , then define χg by χg (u) = χ(g −1 ug). We let
                               Mχ = {g ∈ Mℓ | χg = χ} .
Let Rχ = Mχ Uℓ . Suppose that ω is an irreducible admissible representation of Mχ .
(We will denote this by ω ∈ E(Mχ ).) Let ωχ = ω⊗χ be the associated representation

Definition 1.1. We say that two characters χ1 and χ2 of Uℓ defined as above are
equivalent if χ1 = χg2 for some g ∈ NG (Uℓ ).
    The following result is a consequence of Witt’s Theorem.
Lemma 1.2. Any character χ of Uℓ which is defined as above, is equivalent to one
for which a = (δ, 0, 0 . . . , 1), for some δ.
    From now on we assume for convenience that χ is given as in Lemma 1.2.
    We let ℓ1 = ℓ20 = r − ℓ.
Definition 1.3. Suppose that τ is an admissible representation of G. We say that τ
has an ωχ -Bessel model (or a Bessel model with respect to ωχ ) if HomG (τ, IndG
                                                                               Rχ (ωχ )) 6=
0. If χ is a character of Uℓ , and ℓ1 is defined as above, then we say that τ has a
rank ℓ1 Bessel model.
Remarks.
    (1) By Frobenius reciprocity [BeZb], we have

                      HomG (τ, IndG
                                  Rχ (ωχ )) ≃ HomMχ (τUℓ,χ , ωχ ),


          where τUℓ,χ is the χ-twisted Jacquet module of τ with respect to Uℓ [BeZa].
          Thus, the non-vanishing of τUℓ,χ , for some ℓ and χ, would imply that τ has
          a rank ℓ1 Bessel model with respect to some ωχ .
    (2)   A Whittaker model [Roda,Rodb] is a rank zero Bessel model.
    (3)   One can make these definitions for any choice of Borel subgroup. We choose
          the standard one for convenience, but we will need to use others in the
          sequel.
    (4)   When G = SO2r+1 , Rallis has shown that every irreducible admissible
          representation of G(F ) has a Bessel model for some choice of χ and ω.
    (5)   Suppose that τ is irreducible, ω ∈ E(Mχ ), and λ : Vτ → Vω = Vωχ sat-
          isfies λ(τ (x)v) = δRχ (x)1/2 ωχ (x)λ(v), for all x ∈ Rχ and v ∈ Vτ . (Such
          a λ is called a Bessel functional.) Let v ∈ Vτ and set Bv (g) = λ(τ (g)v).
          Then the map v 7→ Bv realizes an intertwining between τ and IndG    Rχ (ωχ ).
                                                                  G
          Conversely, if there is an embedding T of τ into IndRχ (ωχ ), then setting
          λ(v) = [T (v)](e), we get a map λ : Vτ → Vω with the property specified
          above. Thus, τ has an ωχ -Bessel model if and only if a Bessel functional λ
          exists.
    In this paper we shall make use of the following basic uniqueness principle.
Theorem/Conjecture 1.4. Let τ ∈ E(G). Then for a fixed ω and χ, we have
dimC HomG (τ, IndG
                 Rχ (ωχ )) ≤ 1. That is, a Bessel model is unique for irreducible
representations. 
   Uniqueness for Whittaker models is well-known. For rank one Bessel models,
Theorem 1.4 was proved, for both orthogonal and unitary groups, by Novodvorsky
[Nov]. For Bessel models of arbitrary rank, Theorem 1.4 has been proved when G
is an orthogonal group by S. Rallis ( [Ral]). Though the argument in the unitary
case should be similar, it has not yet been written down in full detail.
   In the remainder of this paper we study those Bessel models for which the unique-

henceforth. Our results are therefore complete for split orthogonal groups and for
rank one Bessel models on quasi-split unitary groups, while they are contingent
upon the truth of Theorem/Conjecture 1.4 for higher rank Bessel models in the
unitary case.
   To conclude this section we introduce the notion of a minimal Bessel model for
an admissible representation τ of G. This will be a key notion in what follows.
Definition 1.5. Suppose that τ has an ωχ -Bessel model which is of rank ℓ1 . We
say that this model is minimal if τ has no Bessel model of rank ℓ1 −1 with respect to
a representation ωχ′ ′ obtained as follows: χ′ is a character of Uℓ+1 such that χ′ = χ
on the simple roots of Uℓ (this implies that Mχ′ ⊂ Mχ ), and ω ′ is a component of
ω|Mχ′ .
   This condition is used in our proof of Proposition 2.4 below; see the discussion
following the proof of Lemma 2.10.
   If τ has a Bessel model, we denote by B(τ ) the smallest non-negative integer ℓ1
such that τ has a Bessel model of rank ℓ1 . For example, τ is generic if and only
if B(τ ) = 0. Then any Bessel model for τ of rank B(τ ) is clearly a minimal Bessel
model in the sense of Definition 1.5. In particular, any representation which has a
Bessel model has a minimal Bessel model.
§2 Induction of Bessel models. In this section we study the behavior of minimal
Bessel models under induction and prove an analogue of Rodier’s Theorem [Rodb]
for such models.

be a parabolic subgroup of G, with M as in (2.1) or (2.2). Let π be as in (2.3)
with each σi generic. Further suppose that τ has a Bessel model, and that χ1 is
a character of Uℓ ∩ G(m) which gives rise to an ωχ1 –Bessel model for τ which is
minimal. Let χ be a character of Uℓ such that χ|Uℓ ∩GLni (k) is ψ–generic for each
i and such that χ|Uℓ ∩G(m) = χ1 . Then IndG                      w0
                                           P (π) has a unique ωχ -Bessel model.
Conversely, if any of the σi are non-generic, or if τ has no Bessel model, then
IndG
   P (π) has no Bessel model.
   The remainder of this section will be devoted to the proof of Theorem 2.1.
The first step is to reduce the theorem to the case of a maximal proper parabolic
subgroup. To do this, suppose Theorem 2.1 holds for maximal proper parabolic
subgroups and let P = MN be an arbitrary parabolic. Then M is of the form
(2.1) or (2.2). Let P1 = M1 N1 be the standard maximal proper parabolic with
M1 = GLr−m × G(m) or M1 = ResE           F (GLr−m ) × G(m) which contains M. Let
         M1
ρ = IndP ∩M1 (π). Then ρ = ρ1 ⊗ τ, where ρ1 is the representation of GLr−m (k)
parabolically induced from σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σt . Since each σi is generic, Rodier’s Theorem
implies that ρ1 has a unique generic constituent. Now for each irreducible con-
stituent π1 of ρ1 , the representation π1 ⊗ τ satisfies the hypothesis of the Theorem.
Then, by assumption,
                       IndG          G      M1
                          P (π) = IndP1 (IndP ∩M1 (π) ⊗ 1N1 )
will have a unique Bessel model of the desired type.
   Now suppose that P = MN is a maximal proper parabolic subgroup of G. Then
for some n, 1 ≤ n ≤ r, and m = r −n we have M ≃ GLn ×G(m) if G is orthogonal,
and M ≃ ResE/F (GLn ) × G(m) if G is unitary. Let π = σ ⊗ τ ∈ E(M ), where
σ ∈ E(GLn (k)) and τ ∈ E(G(m)). Suppose that τ has an ωχ1 -Bessel model of rank
ℓ1 ≥ 0, and it is minimal. Assume that χ1 is of the form given in Lemma 1.2. Let
ℓ = r − ℓ1 . Note that ℓ1 ≤ m implies ℓ ≥ n. Let ℓ′ = ℓ − n = m − ℓ1 . Then χ1
is a character of Uℓ′′ , where U′ℓ′ = Uℓ′ ∩ G(m). Let χ0 be the generic character of
the upper triangular unipotent subgroup U0 of GLn by given by a fixed additive
character ψ. Now define the character χ on Uℓ by χ = χ0 ⊗ χ1 ⊗ 1U ′ , where U ′ is
the complement of U0 × Uℓ′′ in Uℓ . Note that Mχ = Mχ1 . We will examine the space
of ωχ -Bessel functionals for IndG P (σ ⊗ τ ).
   In order to carry out our computation, we have to give a description of the
Rχ − P double cosets in G. The given list of such double cosets is exhaustive, but
overdefined.

We now give a list of coset representatives for W/WM . We will say that a permu-

Lemma 2.2. Suppose that w ∈ W.
  (a) If G 6= SO2r , then there is an element w1 of W so that w ≡ w1 (mod WM )
      with w1 a product of disjoint transpositions in Sr0 . More precisely, we may
      choose w1 of the form w1′ w1′′ , with

                                                       k
                                                       Y
                                           w1′     =         (ai a′i ),
                                                       i=1

         for some {ai } ⊂ {1, . . . , n}, and

                                                   j
                                                   Y
                                        w1′′   =         (bi ci )(c′i b′i ),
                                                   i=1

       with {bi } ⊂ {1, . . . , n}, and {ci } ⊂ {n+1, n+2, . . . , r0 −n}. Furthermore we
       may assume that the transpositions appearing in w1′ and w1′′ are all disjoint.
   (b) If G = SO2r , then w ≡ w1 w2 , where w1 is of the form given in part (a), and
       either w2 = 1, w2 = (d0 d′0 ), for some n + 1 ≤ d0 ≤ r, or w2 = (i0 j0′ i′0 j0 ),
       for some 1 ≤ i0 ≤ n < j0 ≤ r. In each case w1 and w2 are disjoint.

Proof. We first write w = cs, with s ∈ Sr and c ∈ Zr2 . Since c acts on the cy-
cles of s independently, we may assume that s is a pair of “companion” cycles,
(a1 a2 . . . at )(a′1 a′2 . . . a′t ). If s = 1, or the length of each of the two companion cy-
cles in s is two, then the claim is trivially true, so we assume that the length of each
of the cycles is greater than two. Suppose that the claim holds whenever the length
of the two cycles in s is less than t. Without loss of generality, we may assume that
a1 ≤ n. If, for some i, we have ai , ai+1 ≤ n, then

   w ≡ w(ai ai+1 )(a′i a′i+1 ) = c(a1 . . . ai−1 ai ai+2 . . . at )(a′1 . . . a′i−1 a′i a′i+2 . . . a′t ),

and the claim holds by induction. Similarly, we may assume that if ai > n, then
ai+1 ≤ n. This argument also shows that we may assume that t is even. Now we
see that

             w ≡ cs · (a1 at−1 at−3 . . . a3 )(a′1 a′t−1 a′t−3 . . . a′3 )
                = c(a1 at )(a3 a2 ) . . . (at−1 at−2 )(a′1 a′t )(a′3 a′2 ) . . . (a′t−1 a′t−2 ).

Now write c = (b1 b′1 )(b2 b′2 ) . . . (bs b′s ), with bi 6= bj , for i 6= j.
  If, for a fixed even i ≥ 2, {ai , ai+1 } ⊂ {bj }sj=1 , then the product

                  (ai a′i )(ai+1 a′i+1 )(ai+1 ai )(a′i+1 a′i ) = (ai a′i+1 )(ai+1 a′i )

appears in the reduced product for w. The same is true if {a1 , at } ⊂ {bj }sj=1 , i.e.,
(a1 a′t )(at a′1 ) appears in w. If i ≥ 2 is even and {ai , ai+1 } ∩ {bj }sj=1 = ∅, then c
commutes with (ai ai+1 )(a′i a′i+1 ), and so this product of transpositions appears in
w. Similarly, if {a1 , at } ∩ {bj }sj=1 = ∅, then (a1 at )(a′1 a′t ) appears in w.
   Suppose i ≥ 2 is even and that exactly one element of {ai , ai+1 } belongs to
{bj }sj=1 . Then, if G 6= SO2r , we can replace w by w(ai a′i ), and we see that either
8                  SOLOMON FRIEDBERG AND DAVID GOLDBERG

ai+1 or ai is in {bj }sj=1 . If G = SO2r and w either fixes some d0 > n, or interchanges
some d0 and d′0 , then we can instead multiply w by (ai a′i )(d0 d′0 ), which shows
that one of (ai+1 ai )(a′i a′i+1 ) or (ai+1 a′i )(ai a′i+1 ) appears. We see that the above
considerations apply equally well to the pair {a1 , at }. By fixing the element d0
before starting the above process, we can guarantee that, when we have concluded,
w2 = 1 or w2 = (d0 d′0 ).
   Finally suppose that no such d0 exists. Thus, w(d) 6= d, d′ for all n + 1 ≤ d ≤ r.
So we may now assume that d ∈ {ai }, for each d, n + 1 ≤ d ≤ r. Suppose that
the number of d for which d = ai ∈ {bj } with ai+1 6∈ {bj } is even. (Here we are
including {a1 , at } as one possible pair.) Then we see that
                                             Y
                                      w≡w     (d d′ ),

where the product is over precisely those d = ai for which ai+1 6∈ {bj }, is of
the form w1 as claimed. Finally if {n + 1 ≤ d ≤ r|d ∈ {bj }} is odd, then we
fix some such d0 . Without loss of generality, assume that d0 = at . Multiplying
on the right by the elements (d d′ ), for the other such d, we see that we have a
factor of (at a′t )(a1 at )(a′1 a′t ) remaining to be dealt with. But this product is indeed
w2 = (a1 a′t a′1 at ), as claimed. 
   If G = SO2r , and w2 is of this final form, then there is some flexibility as to
the indices appearing in w2 . That is, we may choose, for d0 , any of the ai > n for
which (ai a′i ) appears in c, but (ai+1 a′i+1 ) does not. We will need this below.
   Recall that ℓ0 = r0 − 2ℓ. Let s = ℓ0 − 2. Suppose x = (x1 , . . . , xs ) ∈ F s if G is

where x̄ is the Galois conjugate of x if G is unitary, and is x if G is orthogonal.
  The next result is a straightforward consequence of Witt’s Theorem and the
Bruhat decomposition. Here and for the rest of this section, we pass between a
Weyl group element and its coset representative without changing the notation.
Proposition 2.3.
    (a) Let g ∈ G. Then for some w ∈ W and some x ∈ F s , we have Rχ gP =
        Rχ n(x)wP. Clearly we can choose w up to WM , i.e., we may assume w = w1
        is of the form given in Lemma 2.2.
    (b) Denote by ||x|| the standard length of x ∈ F s or E s accordingly. If ||x|| =
        ||x1 ||, then Rχ n(x)wP = Rχ n(x1 )wP, for all w.

   If H ⊂ G, we will use indG
                            H (π) to denote the representation of G compactly
induced from π [BeZa,Cas]. Recall that IndG              G

locally constant V –valued functions on G, and let Cc∞ (G, V ) denote the subspace
of elements of C ∞ (G, V ) with compact support. Let D(G, V ) = Cc∞ (G, V )∗ be the
space of V –distributions on G.
   Let Vσ be the space of σ, Vτ be the space of τ, and Vω the space of ω (and hence
the space of ωχ ). We let Vπ = Vσ ⊗ Vτ . Denote by V the vector space Ṽω ⊗ Vπ ,
where Ṽω is the space of the smooth contragredient ω̃ of ω.
   We wish to analyze the space HomG (IndG            G
                                            P (π), IndRχ (ωχ )). Dualizing, and using
Theorem 2.4.2 of [Cas], this is isomorphic to the space
                         HomG (indG             G
                                  Rχ (ω̃χ ), IndP (σ̃ ⊗ τ̃ )).

This space, in turn, is isomorphic to the space of intertwining forms on
                                             O

[Har, Lemma 4]. Now by Bruhat’s thesis (see [Rodb, Theorem 4]) this is isomor-
phic to the space of V –distributions T on G satisfying
                                         1/2
(2.4)              ε(r) ∗ T ∗ ε(p−1 ) = δP (p)T ◦ [ω̃χ (r) ⊗ π(p)],
for all r ∈ Rχ and p ∈ P.
   The analysis of this space of distributions will make use of the following propo-
sition. Its proof requires a combinatorial argument, and will be given in several
steps later in this section.
Proposition 2.4. If there is a non-zero V -distribution T satisfying (2.4) for all
r ∈ Rχ and p ∈ P which is supported on Rχ n(x)wP, then Rχ n(x)wP = Rχ w0 P
and σ is generic.
Lemma 2.5. Suppose that T satisfies (2.4). Then T is completely determined by
its restriction to Rχ w0 P.
Proof. First note that a straightforward matrix computation shows that n(x)w0 =
w0 n(x), for any x. Thus
                                   [
                        Rχ w0 P =    Rχ n(x)w0 P = P w0 P,
                                    x

is open. Therefore C = G\Rχ w0 P is closed. Therefore, we have the exact sequence
[BeZa, §1.7]
                0 −→ Cc∞ (Rχ w0 P ) −→ Cc∞ (G) −→ Cc∞ (C) −→ 0.
Then, by tensoring with V, the above exact sequence yields the exact sequence
            0 −→ Cc∞ (Rχ w0 P , V ) −→ Cc∞ (G, V ) −→ Cc∞ (C, V ) −→ 0.
Dualizing, we get the exact sequence
               0 −→ D(C, V ) −→ D(G, V ) −→ D(Rχ w0 P, V ) −→ 0.
Let DRχ ,P be the subspace of distributions satisfying (2.4). Then Proposition 2.4
implies that if T ∈ D(G, V )Rχ ,P and f ∈ Cc∞ (C, V ), then T (f ) = 0. Thus, the
above sequence tells us that D(G, V )Rχ ,P ≃ D(Rχ w0 P, V )Rχ ,P , which completes
the proof of the Lemma. 

Lemma 2.6. There exists an isomorphism between the vector space D(Rχ w0 P, V )Rχ ,P
and the vector space of distributions in D(Uℓ ) ⊗ D(P, V ) of the form
                                         −1/2
                            χ(u) du ⊗ δP        (m) dQ(m) dn,

where Q ∈ D(M, V ) satisfies

(2.5)                 ε(r) ∗ Q ∗ ε(m−1 ) = Q ◦ [ω̃χw0 (r) ⊗ π(m)],

for all r ∈ Rχw0 ∩ M, m ∈ M.
Proof. Define a projection

                     P : Cc∞ (Uℓ ) ⊗ Cc∞ (P, V ) → Cc∞ (Uℓ w0 P, V )

by specifying that for all f1 ∈ Cc∞ (Uℓ ) and f2 ∈ Cc∞ (P, V ), one has
                                      Z
            P(f1 ⊗ f2 )(uw0 p) =             f1 (uu1 ) f2 (w0−1 u−1
                                                                 1 w0 p) du1 .

                                  Uℓ ∩w0 P w0−1


Then it follows from [Sil, Lemma 1.2.1] that P is onto. Let T ∈ D(Rχ w0 P, V )Rχ ,P .
For f1 , f2 as above, define T ′ ∈ D(Uℓ ) ⊗ D(P, V ) by

                             T ′ (f1 ⊗ f2 ) = T (P(f1 ⊗ f2 )).

Then one sees easily that (2.4) implies the equality

(2.6)                    ε(u) ∗ T ′ ∗ ε(p−1 ) = ω̃χ (u)T ◦ [π(p)]

for all u ∈ Uℓ , p ∈ P (where π acts on the second factor of V ). As in [Sil, Section
1.8], this implies that T ′ is in fact a pure tensor of the form

(2.7)                      χ(u) du ⊗ δP (m)−1/2 dQ(m) dn.

where Q ∈ D(M, V ). (Here we are using that π(mn) = π(m).) It is a formal
consequence of the definitions that (2.6) implies that

                               Q ∗ ε(m−1 ) = Q ◦ [π(m)]

for all m ∈ M . We claim that, more strongly, equation (2.5) holds. To see this,
write
                        dQ(p) = δP (m)−1/2 dQ(m) dn.
Let f1 ∈ Cc∞ (Uℓ ), f2 ∈ Cc∞ (P, V ) and r ∈ Rχ ∩ w0 M w0−1 . Then by (2.4) we have
    Z                 Z                       Z
       f1 (u)χ(u) du ω̃χ (r)f2 (p) dQ(p) =        f1 (u) ω̃χ (r)f2 (p) dT ′ (u, p)
     Uℓ              P                            Uℓ ×P

                                            =         P(f1 ⊗ f2 )(ruw0 p) dT (uw0 p).

But ruw0 p = (rur −1 )w0 (w0−1 rw0 p), so this expression is equal to

where in this last equality the defining properties of Rχ = Mχ Uℓ have been used to
simplify the Uℓ integral. Since this holds for all f1 ∈ Cc∞ (Uℓ ) one concludes that

                               ε(w0−1 rw0 ) ∗ Q = Q ◦ ω̃χ (r)

for all r ∈ Rχ ∩ w0 M w0−1 , as desired.
   Conversely, given a distribution Q satisfying equation (2.5), one reverses the
above steps to arrive at a distribution T ′ ∈ D(Uℓ ) ⊗ D(P, V ) satisfying (2.6). Since
the map P is onto, one may define a distribution T ∈ D(Uℓ w0 P, V ) by the formula

                              T (P(f1 ⊗ f2 )) = T ′ (f1 ⊗ f2 )
                               P                             P
provided one shows that if P( i f1,i ⊗ f2,i ) = 0, then T ′ ( i f1,i ⊗ f2,i ) = 0. This
follows as in [HeR, Theorem 15.24]. Since Mχ ⊆ w0−1 M w0 and Rχ = Uℓ Mχ , it
follows from (2.5) and (2.7) that the T so-obtained satisfies (2.4).
   The maps T 7→ Q, Q 7→ T described above are clearly inverses. This completes
the proof of the Lemma. 
   We now complete the proof of Theorem 2.1, modulo the proof of Proposition
2.4. Let Q be as in the proof of Lemma 2.6. Then by Bruhat’s thesis once again,
Q corresponds to an element of

                             HomM (indM          w0
                                      Rχ 0 ∩M (ω̃χ ), σ̃ ⊗ τ̃ ),
                                       w




which, by duality gives an element of HomM (π, IndM            w0
                                                     Rχ 0 ∩M (ωχ )). Since M = GLn (k)×
                                                      w

G(m), where G1 is either GLn (F ) or GLn (E), depending on whether G is orthogo-
nal or unitary, we see that this last space is exactly the space of Whittaker models
for σ tensored with the space of ωχw0 –Bessel models for τ. 
Proof of Proposition 2.4. The remainder of the section will consist of a proof of
Proposition 2.4. This is carried out in several steps. We begin by showing that,
on many double cosets, the compatibility condition π(p) = ωχ (wpw−1 ) can not be
satisfied for some p ∈ P with r = wpw−1 ∈ Rχ . By [Sil, Theorem 1.9.5], this is
sufficient to imply the Proposition.
   Let Σ+ P denote the set of positive roots in N. Let ∆ denote the simple roots of T
in G which give rise to our choice of Borel subgroup. If α ∈ Φ(G, T), then we let
Xα be the corresponding element of a Chevalley basis for the Lie algebra of U or
Ū. Let αi denote the root ei − ei+1 , and β = eℓ + eℓ+1 . Let X = {α1 , α2 , . . . , αℓ , β}.

χ(I + tXα ) = ψα (t). Also, note that X ∩ Σ+                                   +
                                           P = {αn }. We list the elements of ΣP ,
for future reference. If G = SO2r+1 , then

                    Σ+
                     P = {ei ± ej | 1 ≤ i ≤ n < j ≤ r} ∪
                          {ei + ej | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} ∪ {ei |1 ≤ i ≤ n} .

If G = U2r , then

                    Σ+
                     P = {ei ± ej | 1 ≤ i ≤ n < j ≤ r} ∪
                         {ei + ej | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} ∪ {2ei |1 ≤ i ≤ n} .

If G = U2r+1 , then

                Σ+
                 P = {ei ± ej | 1 ≤ i ≤ n < j ≤ r} ∪
                        {ei + ej | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} ∪ {ei , 2ei |1 ≤ i ≤ n} .

Finally, if G = SO2r , then

                          Σ+
                           P = {ei ± ej | 1 ≤ i ≤ n < j ≤ r} ∪
                                {ei + ej | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} .

We list the various I + Xα , which generate the root subgroups Uα of U. Let Eij
denote the elementary matrix whose only non-zero entry is a 1 in the ij-th entry.
We recall the convention that i′ = r0 +1−i. Suppose E = F (γ), where γ̄ = −γ, and
a 7→ ā is the Galois automorphism of E/F. If α = ei −ej , then I+Xα = I+Eij −Ej ′ i′
if G is orthogonal, and I + Xα = I + γEij − γEj ′ i′ if G is unitary. If α = ei + ej ,
then I + Xα = I + Eij ′ − Eji′ if G is orthogonal, and I + Xα = I + γEij ′ − γEji′
if G is unitary. If α = ei , then I + Xα = I + Ei,r+1 − Er+1,i′ if G = SO2r+1 , and
I + Xα = I + γEi,r+1 − γEr+1,i′ if G = U2r+1 . Finally, if G is unitary and α = 2ei ,
then I + Xα = I + γEii′ .
   Suppose that, for some α ∈ Σ+                 ′
                                    P , we have α = wα ∈ X. Choose some t ∈ F
                                                                                   ×

for which ψα′ (t) 6= 1. Now set p = I + tXα , which is in P. Then r = wpw−1 =
I + tXα′ ∈ Uℓ ⊂ Rχ . Note that π(p) = 1 6= ωχ (r) = ψα (t). Thus, if w has the above
property, Rχ wP can support no distribution of the desired type.
Lemma 2.7. Let G = SO2r . Suppose that, as in Lemma 2.2, w ∈ W is equivalent
mod WM to w1 w2 , with w2 = (i0 j0′ i′0 j0 ), for some 1 ≤ i0 ≤ n < j0 ≤ r. Then
wΣ+
  P ∩ X 6= ∅.

Proof. From the proof of Lemma 2.2, we may assume that for each n+1 ≤ k ≤ r, we
have w(k) = ik or i′k , for some 1 ≤ ik ≤ n. First suppose that (in+1 n + 1)(i′n+1 (n +
1)′ ) appears in w. Consider first the case that for all k, n + 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ, we have a
permutation (ik k)(i′k k ′ ) appearing in w. Since ℓ + 1 = w(iℓ+1 ) or ℓ + 1 = w(i′ℓ+1 ),
we have w(eiℓ + eiℓ+1 ) = eℓ ± eℓ+1 , which will be in X. So now we may suppose
that either j0 ≤ ℓ, or (ik k ′ )(i′k k) appears in w, for some k with n + 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ.
Since w changes an even number of signs, we see that in the former case there
must be some k with n + 1 ≤ k ≤ r, so that (ik k ′ )(i′k k) appears in w. Now we
can multiply on the right by (j0 j0′ )(k k ′ ), to see that, in fact, we may assume
        ON LOCAL COEFFICIENTS FOR NON-GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS                            13

the minimal such k0 , we know that k0 = w(i′k0 ), while k0 − 1 = w(ik0 −1 ). Thus,
αk0 −1 = w(eik0 −1 + eik0 ) ∈ wΣ+    P ∩ X, and the Lemma holds.
   Thus, we may assume that either (in+1 (n +1)′ )(i′n+1 n +1) appears in w, or that
(in+1 (n + 1)′ i′n+1 n + 1) does. In the former case, we may multiply on the right by
(n + 1 (n + 1)′ )(j0 j0′ ), to get an equivalent w for which the latter is true, i.e, we may
assume that i0 = in+1 . First suppose w(n) = n. Then w(en + ei0 ) = αn ∈ wΣ+           P ∩X
and we are done. Suppose instead that w(n) = n′ , i.e., that (n n′ ) appears in w.
Let i be the smallest positive integer so that w(n − i) 6= n − i′ . (By our assumption
on the form of w, such an i exists.) Then n − i = ik , for some k ≥ n + 1, and
n − i = w(k) or w(k ′ ). Therefore, αn−i is equal to either w(en−i+1 − ek ) or to
w(en−1+1 + ek ). In either case, αn−i ∈ wΣ+        P ∩ X. Finally, we may suppose that
either n = i0 or that one of (n k)(n′ k ′ ) or (n k ′ )(n′ k) appears in w, for some k,
n + 1 ≤ k ≤ r. If (n k)(n′ k ′ ) appears in w, then we may multiply on the right by

                           ((n + 1) k)((n + 1)′ k ′ )(i0 n)(i′0 n′ ),

to replace w by an equivalent element with i0 = n. Similarly, if (n k ′ )(n′ k) appears
in w, then we may multiply on the right by

                (n + 1 k)((n + 1)′ k ′ )(i0 n)(i′0 n′ )(k k ′ )(n + 1 (n + 1)′ ),

to see that we may assume that i0 = n. We are thus reduced to the case where
(n (n + 1)′ n′ n + 1) appears in w. In this case, w(en + en+1 ) = αn ∈ wΣ+
                                                                         P ∩ X.
Thus, in all cases, the Lemma holds. 
Remark. For future use we make note of the following fact. If w is as in Lemma 2.7,
and if w−1 αℓ ∈ Σ+P , then the proof of Lemma 2.7 shows that either w
                                                                      −1
                                                                         αℓ = ei +ej ,
                               +
for some i, j ≤ n, or that wΣP ∩ X 6= {αℓ }.
   We now describe those w which have the property that wΣ+  P ∩X = ∅. By Lemmas
2.2 and 2.7, we may assume that w is a product of disjoint transpositions.
Lemma 2.8. Suppose that w ∈ W is a representative for a class in W/WM , and
w is in the form specified by Lemma 2.2. Further suppose that, for all α ∈ Σ+
                                                                            P , we
have wα 6∈ X. Then the following hold:
   (a) For all k with n + 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ, we have w(k) > n;
   (b) For all i with 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we have w(i) 6= i.

Proof. (a) First suppose that w(ℓ) ≤ n. If w(ℓ + 1) ≤ n, then w(β) ∈ Σ+        P , con-
                                                                         +
tradicting our choice of w. If w(ℓ + 1) = ℓ + 1, then again w(β) ∈ ΣP . Finally, if
w(ℓ + 1) ≥ n′ , then w(αℓ ) ∈ Σ+
                               P . So we must have w(ℓ) > n.
   Now suppose that for some k, n + 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ − 1, we have w(k) ≤ n. If w(k + 1) =
k + 1, or w(k + 1) ≥ n′ , then w(αk ) ∈ Σ+   P , which is a contradiction. Therefore,
w(k + 1) ≤ n. However, this implies, by induction, that w(ℓ) ≤ n, which we have
already seen is impossible. Therefore, w(k) > n.
   (b) Suppose that w(i) = i for some i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. If w(i + 1) 6= i + 1, then
w(i + 1) > n, and so w(αi ) ∈ Σ+  P . Since this contradicts our choice of w, we have
w(i + 1) = i + 1. We may thus suppose that w fixes n. Now by part (a), we have
w(n + 1) ≥ n + 1, and therefore, wαn ∈ Σ+      P . This again is a contradiction, so w
cannot fix n. Therefore, w fixes none of the integers 1, 2, . . . , n. 

Lemma 2.9. Suppose that w is as in Lemma 2.8 and assume that w(n) 6= n′ . Then
for n + 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ, we have w(k) = k.
Proof. By Lemma 2.8(a) it is enough to show that it is impossible that w(k) ≥ n′
for any such k. Suppose to the contrary that there is some k, with n +1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ, for
which w(k) ≥ n′ . Then there some i ≤ n, for which k = w(i′ ). If w(k − 1) = k − 1,
then αk−1 = w(ei + ek−1 ) ∈ wΣ+   P ∩ X. Since this contradicts our choice of w, we
must have w(k − 1) ≥ n′ . Therefore, by (downwards) induction, w(n + 1) ≥ n′ . Set
w(n + 1) = i′ . Since w(n) 6= n, and, by assumption, w(n) 6= n′ , either w(n) = k
or w(n) = k ′ for some k, with n + 1 ≤ k ≤ n′ − 1. Therefore, αn = w(ei + ek ) or
αn = w(ei − ek ). Either one of these possibilities contradicts our assumption on w.
Thus w(n + 1) < n′ , which then implies the result of the Lemma. 
Lemma 2.10. Suppose that w is as in Lemma 2.8. Suppose that there is some i,
2 ≤ i ≤ n, for which w(i) = i′ . Then w(i − 1) = (i − 1)′ .
Proof. Suppose w(i − 1) 6= (i − 1)′ . By Lemma 2.8(b), we can choose k, with
n + 1 ≤ k ≤ r so that w(i − 1) = k or w(i − 1) = k ′ . Now αi−1 = w(ei − ek ) or
αi−1 = w(ei + ek ). Since this contradicts our choice of w we conclude w(i − 1) =
(i − 1)′ . 
  Thus, if w is chosen as in Lemma 2.2 with wΣ+                              ′
                                                    P ∩ X = ∅ and w(n) = n , then
w = w0 . If wΣ+                              ′
                P ∩ X = ∅, and w(n) 6= n , then by Lemma 2.9, w(ℓ) = ℓ. If
w(ℓ + 1) 6= ℓ + 1, then either αℓ or β would be of the form wα for some α ∈ Σ+     P.
Consequently, w(ℓ + 1) = ℓ + 1, and therefore w(α) = α for α ∈ {αn+1 . . . , αℓ , β}.
Thus, for some i0 < n, and some {ai } ⊂ {ℓ + 2, . . . , (ℓ + 2)′ },

(2.8) w = (1 r0 )(2 r0 − 1) . . . (i0 i′0 )(i0 + 1 ai0 +1 )((i0 + 1)′ a′i0 +1 ) . . . (n an )(n′ a′n ).

Let a = an if an ≤ r, and a = a′n otherwise. Then wαn = ±ea − en+1 . Let
X1 = {αn+1 . . . , αℓ , β, wαn }. Note that

                                 X1 = w({αn , αn+1 . . . , αℓ , β}),

and is thus a linearly independent subset of the root system Φ(G(m), T′ ), where we
recall that T′ = T ∩ G(m). We extend X1 \ {β} to a set of simple roots for G(m).
Set B′ = T1 U′′ to be the corresponding Borel subgroup of G(m), and suppose
that Uℓ′′′ +1 is the subgroup of U′′ which is conjugate to U′ℓ′ +1 and generated by
the elements of X1 . (Recall that Uℓ′′ is the subgroup supporting the character χ1
which gives rise to the model for τ.) Now let χ′ be the character of Uℓ′′′ +1 so that
χ′ (I + tXα ) = ψα (t), for α ∈ X1 \ {αℓ }, and χ′ (I + tXαℓ ) = ψαℓ (δt). Let Mχ′
be the corresponding normalizer in Mℓ′ +1 . Note that Mχ′ ⊂ Mχ . Suppose that
m′ ∈ Mχ′ . If the distribution T satisfies (2.4), then ε(m′ ) ∗ T = T ◦ ω(m′ ). So for
some component ω ′ of ω|Mχ′ , we have

                             ε(r) ∗ T ∗ ε(h) = T ◦ [ω̃χ′ ′ (r) ⊗ τ (h)],

for all h ∈ G(m), and r ∈ Rχ′ = Mχ′ Uℓ′′′ +1 . If T is non-zero, this now implies
that τ has a Bessel model with respect to U ′′ , χ′ and ω ′ . However, since Uℓ+1
                                                                              ′′
                                                                                  is
isomorphic to Uℓ+1 , this is a rank ℓ1 − 1 Bessel model for τ. This contradicts the
        ON LOCAL COEFFICIENTS FOR NON-GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS                         15

   Note that this argument shows that IndGP (π) cannot have any Bessel model of
rank less than B(τ ) supported on Rχ wP .
   Finally, suppose that w = w0 . Let u ∈ Ū ∩ GLn (F ). Set r = w0−1 uw0 . Then
r ∈ Uℓ , and χ(r) = χw0 (u). Since
                       0




                   ε(r) ∗ T = T ◦ [χw
                                    0 (u)] = T ∗ ε(u) = T ◦ [σ(u)],
                                      0




we see that σ must be generic if T is non-zero [Rodb]. This completes the proof
of Proposition 2.4 for the cosets Rχ wP, with w ∈ W/WM .
   We now examine the double cosets represented by n(x)w, where x = (x1 , . . . , xs )
is a vector. Recall that

                                Iℓ
                                                                     

where x̄ is the Galois conjugate of x if G is unitary, and x̄ = x if G is orthogonal.
    We assume that w is of the form given in Lemma 2.2. First note that if α ∈
X \{αℓ }, then n(x)(I +tXα )n(x)−1 = I +tXα . Suppose that wΣ+      P ∩(X \{αℓ }) 6= ∅.

Choose α ∈ ΣP with wα = α ∈ X \ {αℓ }, and t for which ψα (t) 6= 1. Setting
p = I + tXα′ , we have n(x)wpw−1 n(x)−1 = I + tXα ∈ Rχ . Furthermore ωχ (x) =
ψα (t) 6= 1, while π(p) = 1. Thus, Rχ n(x)wP supports no distributions satisfying
(2.4).
    Now suppose that wΣ+   P ∩ X = {αℓ }. First suppose that w
                                                                 −1
                                                                    αℓ = ei + ej , with
i, j ≤ n. Without loss of generality, assume that w(i) = ℓ, and w(j) = (ℓ + 1)′ .
Suppose that ℓ + 2 ≤ k ≤ r. If w(k) = ik ≤ n then w−1 (eℓ + ek ) = ei + eik ∈ Σ+   P . If
                  ′                          −1
instead w(k) = ik for some ik ≤ n, then w (eℓ −ek ) = ei +eik . Finally, if w(k) = k,
then w−1 (eℓ ± ek ) = ei ± ek ∈ Σ+ P . Choose s0 ≤ s for which xs0 6= 0. Let y = xs0 .
Choose k0 with the property that either w−1 (eℓ +ek0 ) or w−1 (eℓ −ek0 ) is an element
of Σ+P . Denote the root eℓ ± ek0 as α0 , with ± chosen so that w
                                                                  −1
                                                                     α 0 ∈ Σ+
                                                                            P . We may
also assume that Xα0 has −1 as its (r + ℓ1 , ℓ + s0 ) entry (see Lemma 2.3). Now
note that
                    n(x)(I + tXα0 )n(x)−1 = (I + tXα0 )(I + ytXβ ).

Thus, if ψα0 (yt) 6= 0, and p = I + tXw−1 α0 ∈ N, then π(p) = 1, while

                       ωχ (n(x)wpw−1 n(x)−1 ) = ψα0 (yt) 6= 1.

Consequently, Rχ n(x)wP cannot support a V -distribution of the desired form.
   We are left with the cases wΣ+

Lemma 2.11. Suppose that wΣ+
                           P ∩X = {αℓ }, but w
                                               −1
                                                  αℓ 6= ei +ej , for all i, j ≤ n.
Then w(ℓ) = ℓ.
Proof. If w−1 (ℓ) = j ′ for some j ≤ n, then w−1 αℓ 6∈ Σ+
                                                        P , which is a contradiction.
Suppose w−1 (ℓ) = j ≤ n. If w(ℓ + 1) = ℓ + 1, then w−1 (β) = ej + eℓ+1 ∈ Σ+        P,
                                                                 −1         +
contradicting our choice of w. If w(ℓ + 1) = i ≤ n, then w αℓ 6∈ ΣP , which
also contradicts our choice of w. Finally, if w−1 (ℓ + 1) = i′ for some i ≤ n, then
w−1 αℓ = ej + ei , which is again a contradiction. Thus, w(ℓ) = ℓ. 
Lemma 2.12. If w is as in Lemma 2.11, then for n + 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ − 1, we have
w−1 (k) > n.
Proof. Suppose that w−1 (k) = j ≤ n. If w(k +1) = k +1, then w−1 αk = ej −ek+1 ∈
Σ+                   ′
  P . If w(k + 1) = i for some i ≤ n, then w
                                             −1
                                                αk = ej + ei . Either case contradicts
our hypotheses. Therefore w (k + 1) ≤ n. Now by induction, w−1 (ℓ − 1) ≤ n. On
                             −1

the other hand, by Lemma 2.11, w(ℓ) = ℓ. Therefore w−1 αℓ−1 ∈ Σ+      P , contradicting
                                  −1
our choice of w. Consequently, w (k) > n. 
Lemma 2.13. Suppose that w is as in Lemma 2.11. Then w(n) 6= n.
Proof. Suppose that w(n) = n. If w(n + 1) = n + 1, then w fixes αn , which
is in the intersection of X and Σ+  P . If w
                                             −1
                                                (n + 1) = j ′ for some j ≤ n, then
w−1 αn = en + ej . Both of these possibilities contradict our choice of w. By Lemma
2.12, w−1 (n + 1) > n, and so these are the only two choices for w(n + 1). Since each
leads to a contradiction, w(n) 6= n. 
Lemma 2.14. Suppose that w is as in Lemma 2.11.
  (a) For all i ≤ n we have w(i) 6= i.
  (b) If w(i0 ) = i′0 , for some i0 ≤ n then w(i) = i′ for all i ≤ i0 .
Proof. (a) Suppose that w(i) = i for some i ≤ n. Choose the maximal such i. By
Lemma 2.13, i < n. Suppose that w(i + 1) = (i + 1)′ . Then w−1 αi = ei + ei+1 ∈ Σ+P.
                                                                           ′
Thus in this case we have a contradiction. If w(i + 1) = k or w(i + 1) = k for some
n + 1 ≤ k ≤ r, then w−1 αi = ei ± ek ∈ Σ+P . This is also a contradiction, and hence
no i ≤ n can be fixed by w.
   (b) Suppose that w(i) = i′ , for some i ≤ n. If w(i − 1) = k or k ′ for some
n + 1 ≤ k ≤ r, then w−1 αi−1 = ei ± ek ∈ Σ+   P . But by part (a), w(i − 1) 6= i − 1,
so the only remaining possibility is w(i − 1) = (i − 1)′ . This gives the claim by
induction. 
Corollary 2.15. If w is as in Lemma 2.11, then w(n) = k0 or w(n) = k0′ for some
n + 1 ≤ k0 ≤ r. 
Lemma 2.16. Suppose that w is as in Lemma 2.11. Then w(k) = k for all k with
n + 1 ≤ k ≤ ℓ − 1.
Proof. Suppose that w−1 (n + 1) = j ′ for some j ≤ n. Then, by Corollary 2.15,
w−1 αn = ej ± ek0 ∈ Σ+ P , contradicting our choice of w. Thus, by Lemma 2.12,
w(n + 1) = n + 1.
   Now suppose w−1 (k) = jk′ for some k with n + 2 ≤ k ≤ ℓ − 1, and some jk ≤ n.
If w(k − 1) = k − 1, then w−1 αk−1 ∈ Σ+    P , which is a contradiction. Therefore,
by Lemma 2.12, w−1 (k − 1) = jk−1′
                                    , for some jk−1 ≤ n. By induction, this gives
w(n + 1) 6= n + 1, while we have just shown that w(n + 1) = n + 1. Therefore,
w(k) = k. 

Lemma 2.17. Suppose that w is as in Lemma 2.11.
  (a) Suppose that G 6= SO2r . Then, for some n1 , with 0 ≤ n1 < n, and some

                  {kj |1 ≤ j ≤ n − n1 } ⊂ {ℓ + 1, ℓ + 2, . . . , (ℓ + 1)′ },

        we have

              w =(1 r0 )(2 r0 − 1) . . . (n1 n′1 )(n1 + 1 k1 )(k1′ (n1 + 1)′ ) . . .
                   (n kn2 )(kn′ 2 n′ ).

       Here n = n1 + n2 . Furthermore, kj = (ℓ + 1)′ for some j.
   (b) If G = SO2r , and we write w = w1 w2 as in Lemma 2.2, then w2 = 1 or
       w2 = (d d′ ), for some ℓ + 2 ≤ d ≤ r. Furthermore w1 is of the form

              w1 =(1 r0 )(2 r0 − 1) . . . (n1 n′1 )(n1 + 1 k1 )(k1′ (n1 + 1)′ ) . . .
                    (n kn2 )(kn′ 2 n′ ),

        with n = n1 + n2 , and the integers kj are as in part (a). Moreover, kj =
        (ℓ + 1)′ for some j.
Proof. First note that if G = SO2r , and w = w1 w2 , then Lemma 2.16 and the
remark following Lemma 2.7 imply that w2 is not of the form (i j ′ i′ j), for some
1 ≤ i ≤ n < j ≤ r. Moreover, since w−1 αℓ ∈ Σ+        P , Lemmas 2.16 and 2.11 imply that
if w2 = (d d′ ), then ℓ + 2 ≤ d ≤ r. If G 6= SO2r , let w2 = 1.
   By Lemma 2.14(a), w(i) 6= i for all i ≤ n. By Lemma 2.11, Corollary 2.15,
and Lemma 2.16, w(n) = k or k ′ , for some ℓ + 1 ≤ k ≤ r. Let n1 be the largest
nonnegative integer for which n1 < n and w(n1 ) = n′1 . If n1 > 0, then by Lemma
2.14(b) w = (1 r0 )(2 r0 − 1) . . . (n1 n′1 )w2 w′ , where w′ (i) = i for all i ≤ n1 , and w2
and w′ are disjoint. Now w′ (i) 6= i and w′ (i) 6= i′ for n1 + 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and therefore
n + 1 ≤ w′ (i) ≤ n′ − 1. However, by Lemma 2.16, ℓ + 1 ≤ w′ (i) ≤ (ℓ + 1)′ . Thus,

                     w′ = (n1 + 1 k1 )(k1′ n′1 − 1) . . . (n kn2 )(kn′ 2 n′ ),

as claimed. Finally, Lemma 2.11 implies w(ℓ + 1) 6= ℓ + 1, and so we must have
(w′ )−1 (ℓ + 1) = w−1 (ℓ + 1) = j ′ , for some j ≤ n. 
   We now finish the proof of Proposition 2.4. If w = w0 , then n(x)w0 = w0 n(x),
and since n(x) ∈ P, we have Rχ w0 P = Rχ n(x)w0 P. If wΣ+        P ∩ X = {αℓ }, or
    +
wΣP ∩ X = ∅, then Lemma 2.16 and equation (2.8) show that w(en + eℓ ) = eℓ ± ek ,
for some k, with ℓ + 2 ≤ k ≤ r. Let α = w(en + eℓ ), and denote I + tXen +eℓ by p. As
before, choose x0 so that Rχ n(x0 )wP = Rχ n(x)wP, and such that x0 has a non-
zero entry y with ωχ (n(x)wpw−1 n(x)−1 ) = ψα (yt). Note that π(p) = 1. Choosing
t for which ψα (yt) 6= 1, we see that Rχ n(x)wP cannot support a V -distribution of
the desired form. 
  From the argument above, it is apparent that IndG    P (π) cannot have a Bessel
model of rank less than B(τ ). Hence we obtain the following Corollary.
Corollary 2.18. Let the notation be as in Theorem 2.1. Suppose that the ωχ -
Bessel model for τ is of rank B(τ ). Then the ωχw0 -Bessel model for IndG
                                                                        P (π) is also
minimal, and of rank B(τ ).

Corollary 2.19. For any σ, τ, ℓ, χ, and ω, the support of the twisted Jacquet
functor πUℓ ,χ is a finite number of double cosets. 
§3 Holomorphicity and local coefficients.
   In this section we prove the holomorphicity of the Bessel functional and the
existence of a local coefficient. To do so, we first adapt the argument used by Banks
[Ban] to prove the holomorphicity of Whittaker functions for metaplectic covers
of GLn . Banks’s result is an extension of Bernstein’s Theorem, which establishes
the meromorphicity under uniqueness and regularity hypotheses. We show that the
desired regularity holds in the case of Bessel functionals. We then use an argument
similar to Harish-Chandra’s and to Shahidi’s in the generic case to establish the
existence of the local coefficient under certain conditions (Theorem 3.8). Corollary
3.9 shows that the local coefficient factors in a manner analogous to the generic
case.
   Let G be as in Section 1. We use the conventions found in [Cas, §1,Shaa] for
subsets of simple roots, Weyl groups, and arbitrary parabolic subgroups. Suppose
that ∆ is the collection of simple roots corresponding to our choice of Borel sub-
group. Let θ ⊂ ∆ be a collection of simple roots and set P = Pθ . Then P has Levi
decomposition P = Mθ Nθ , with

                     M = Mθ ≃ GLn1 × · · · × GLnk × G(m),

for some ni , m such that r = n1 + · · · + nk + m. We abbreviate this by writing
M ≃ G1 × G(m). We also write N = Nθ .
                                                                   ∗
   Let A = Aθ be the split component of M. Denote by a∗C = (aθ )C the complexified
dual of the real Lie algebra of A, qF the residual characteristic of F, and denote
by HP the Harish-Chandra homomorphism [Har,Shaa]. Suppose that σ ∈ E(G1 )
and τ ∈ E(G(m)), and let π = σ ⊗ τ . For ν ∈ a∗C , let I(ν, π, θ) denote the induced
representation
                                          <ν,HP ()>
                               IndG
                                  P (π ⊗ qF         )
and let V (ν, π, θ) denote the space of associated functions. We also use Πν to denote
the representation I(ν, π, θ).
   Assume that σ is generic and that τ has an ωχ′ –Bessel model which is minimal
and of rank ℓ0 . Let χ be the character of Uℓ whose restriction to Uℓ ∩ G(m) is χ′
and whose restriction to G1 (F ) ∩ Uℓ is a ψ–generic character χ1 . We will construct
a non-zero functional Λχ (ν, π, θ) on Xν = I(ν, π, θ) ⊗ Ṽω so that, for a certain
character δ of Mχ ,

      Λχ (ν, π, θ)(Πν (mu)(fν ⊗ ṽ)) = δ(m)χ(u)−1 Λχ (ν, π, θ)(fν ⊗ ω̃(m−1 )ṽ),

for all choices of fν ⊗ ṽ ∈ Xν and mu ∈ Rχ . Then we will show in Theorem 3.6 that
the function ν 7→ Λ(ν, π, θ)(xν ) is holomorphic, for a holomorphic section ν 7→ xν .
   Let K = G(OF ), where OF is the ring of integers in F. Then K is a good max-
imal compact subgroup of G [Cas]. Let Km be the corresponding m-th principal
congruence subgroup. Then each Km is normal in K. Let Γm be a complete set of
coset representatives for P ∩ K\K/Km . Note that Γm is of finite cardinality. Let
                    ∞

Then F 7→ F |K is a K-isomorphism from V (ν, π, θ) to Y, by the Iwasawa decom-
position of G. We will define a certain functional on Y, and use this realization to
define an associated functional on Xν . Let

                      Ym = {f ∈ Y |f (kk1 ) = f (k), ∀k ∈ K, k1 ∈ Km } .

Thus, Ym is the set of Km –fixed vectors of Y under the action of K. Furthermore,
the Iwasawa decomposition allows us to realize I(ν, π, θ) on Y for each ν. Denote by
Vπ,m the subspace of Vπ consisting of P ∩ Km –fixed vectors. Since π is admissible,
Vπ,m is finite dimensional.
   The next three results are standard. We include the proof of the first two for
completeness. The third is a straightforward consequence of the Iwasawa decom-
position.
Lemma 3.1. Ym has a basis {fj } which satisfies the following properties:
  (1) If γ ∈ Γm , then the non-zero vectors among {fj (γ)} are a basis for Vπ,m .
  (2) If fj is fixed, then fj (γ) 6= 0 for some γ ∈ Γm .

Proof. Suppose that f ∈ Ym . Then f (pkk1 ) = π(p)f (k), for all p ∈ P ∩ K, k ∈ K,
and k1 ∈ Km . Thus, f is completely determined by its values on Γm . Fix γ ∈ Γm ,
and let p ∈ P ∩ Km . Since γ −1 Km γ = Km , we have γ −1 pγ ∈ Km . Therefore,

                           f (γ) = f (γγ −1 pγ) = f (pγ) = π(p)f (γ).

This says that f (γ) is an element of Vπ,m . Fix a basis {vm,i } of Vπ,m . Let fγ,i :
K −→ Vπ,m be given by

                          π(p)vm,i        if k = pγk1 , for some p ∈ P ∩ K, k1 ∈ Km ,
                      
         fγ,i (k) =
                          0              otherwise.

Then it is immediate that fγ,i is a well-defined element of Ym . We claim that {fγ,i }
is a basis for Ym .
   Suppose f ∈ Ym . If γ ′ ∈ Γm , p ∈ P ∩ K, and k ∈ Km , then

                                         f (pγ ′ k) = π(p)f (γ ′ ).

Since f (γ ′ ) ∈ Vπ,m ,                               X
                                         f (γ ′ ) =       cγ ′ ,i vm,i .
                                                      i

This implies that
                                     X                          X
                      f (pγ ′ k) =       cγ ′ ,i π(p)vm,i =           cγ ′ ,i fγ ′ ,i (pγ ′ k).
                                     i                            i

Now, taking the collection {cγ,i } for all γ ∈ Γm , and noting that fγ,i (pγ ′ k) = 0 for
γ 6= γ ′ ,                              X

     On the other hand, suppose that                   cγ,i fγ,i = 0. Then, for any γ ′ ∈ Γm , we have
                                                 γ,i

                                          X
                                                 cγ,i fγ,i (γ ′ ) = 0,
                                           γ,i


which implies that
                             X                                X
                                   cγ ′ ,i fγ ′ ,i (γ ′ ) =         cγ ′ ,i vm,i = 0.
                              i                               i


But, since the vm,i are linearly independent, cγ ′ ,i = 0, for each γ ′ and i. Thus,
{fγ,i } are also linearly independent. The collection fγ,i clearly has properties (1)
and (2). 
   Denote by X the space Y ⊗ Ṽω . For each ν ∈ a∗C let Xν = V (ν, π, θ) ⊗ Ṽω . For
f ∈ Y denote by fν the unique element of V (ν, π, θ) satisfying fν |K = f. Then
{fν ⊗ ṽ|f ∈ Y, ṽ ∈ Ṽω } spans Xν . Recall that Πν can be realized on Y via Πν (g)f =
[Πν (g)fν ] |K . This gives the context in which we discuss the holomorphicity of the
map ν 7→ Πν (g)fν for a fixed choice of g and f.
Lemma 3.2. Fix g ∈ G, f ∈ Y and ṽ ∈ Ṽω . Then the function ν 7→ Πν (g)f ⊗ ṽ is
a regular function from a∗C to X.
Proof. Choose m0 so that f ∈ Ym0 , and choose m > m0 satisfying g −1 Km g ⊂ Km0 .
Then f ∈ Ym and, for all ν ∈ a∗C and k ∈ Km ,

               Πν (k)(Πν (g)fν )(x) = fν (xgg −1kg) = fν (xg) = Πν (g)fν (x),

which says that Πν (g)f ∈ Ym for all ν. Now, by Lemma 3.1,
                                                       X

                                                        γ,i


for a unique choice of cγ,i (ν) ∈ C. It suffices to show that cγ,i : a∗C −→ C is
holomorphic. Fix γ ′ ∈ Γm . Then γ ′ g = pγ ′′ k, for some p ∈ P, γ ′′ ∈ Γm , and
k ∈ Km . Then

Set c′γ ′′ ,i (ν) = qF         δP (p)cγ ′′ ,i (ν).            Then

for all ν. Since the left hand side in the equation above is independent of ν and
the vi are linearly independent, c′γ ′′ ,i (ν) is constant for each i. This implies that
cγ ′′ ,i (ν) is holomorphic. 
    From now on we need to distinguish between a Weyl group element w̃ ∈ W (G, A),
for some torus A, and a representative w ∈ NG (A) for w̃. Let w̃θ = w̃l,∆ w̃l,θ , where
w̃l,∆ is the longest element of the Weyl group W (G, T), and w̃l,θ is the longest
element of W (G, Aθ ). Fix a representative wθ for w̃θ with wθ ∈ K. Note that
w̃θ (θ) ⊂ ∆. Now let M′ = Mw̃θ (θ) = wθ Mθ wθ−1 . Then M′ is a standard Levi sub-
group of G. Let N′ be the standard unipotent subgroup of U so that P′ = M′ N′
is a standard parabolic subgroup of G. Since M′ ≃ M, we have Uℓ ⊃ N′ .
Lemma 3.3. For each m > 0, we have wθ−1 N ′ ∩ P wθ−1 Km is compact.
                                 −1/2
  For m ∈ Mχ , let δ(m) = (δP            δP ′ )(m). Let XRχ ,ω,ν,θ be the subspace spanned
by functions of the form

                       Πν (mu)f ⊗ ṽ − δ(m)χ(u)f ⊗ ω̃(m−1 )ṽ,

for m ∈ Mχ , u ∈ Uℓ , f ∈ Y, and ṽ ∈ Vω̃ . Then a non-zero functional Λ on X is a
(δωχ )-Bessel functional for Πν if and only if Λ|XRχ ,ω,ν,θ ≡ 0. By Theorem 2.1 the
space of such functionals is one-dimensional. Thus X/XRχ ,ω,ν,θ is one-dimensional.
   The construction of this functional will be obtained by taking a direct limit of
functionals given by integrating over compact subsets of N ′ . We show that such a
limit exists and is not identically zero. Moreover, we show that there is a function
in X which is a complement to XRχ ,ω,ν,θ for all ν. This will give the regularity
condition necessary to apply Bernstein’s Theorem and to obtain the holomorphicity
of the functional.
   Now let us fix a Whittaker functional for σ and a Bessel functional for ω. (Ac-
                                                       −1/2
tually, for notational convenience, we twist ω by δRχ .) That is, suppose that
λχ : Vπ ⊗ Ṽω −→ C satisfies

    λχ ((σ(u1 ) ⊗ τ (mu2 ))(v1 ⊗ v2 ) ⊗ ṽ) = χ1 (u1 )χ′ (u2 )λχ (v1 ⊗ v2 ⊗ ω̃(m−1 )ṽ)

for all u1 ∈ Uℓ ∩ G1 , u2 ∈ Uℓ ∩ G(m), and m ∈ Mχ . Let Ω be a compact subgroup
of N ′ . Define a functional on X by
                                     Z
(3.1)          λΩ
                π,ν,θ (f   ⊗ ṽ) =       λχ (Πν (wθ−1 u)fν (e) ⊗ ṽ)χ(u)−1 du.
                                     Ω

This functional depends on the choice of the representative wθ for w̃θ .
   Since N ′ is exhausted by compact subgroups, the compact subgroups of N ′ form
a directed set. The following Lemma was suggested to the authors by Prof. Steve
Rallis.
Lemma 3.4. For every f ⊗ ṽ ∈ X, the limit lim λΩ
                                                π,ν,θ (f ⊗ ṽ) exists, where the limit
                                                      Ω
is the direct limit taken over all compact subgroups of N ′ .
Proof. Fix f ⊗ ṽ ∈ X. Let Ωr be the subset of N ′ of elements with all entries of
22                  SOLOMON FRIEDBERG AND DAVID GOLDBERG

                                                  Ωr
such that if Ω ⊃ Ωr then λΩ     π,ν,θ (f ⊗ ṽ) = λπ,ν,θ (f ⊗ ṽ). This follows since, for r
sufficiently large, if γ ∈ N ′ \ Ωr then
                        Z
                           λχ (Πν (wθ−1 u)fν (e) ⊗ ṽ)χ(u)−1 du = 0.
                        Ωr γ


Indeed, there is a subgroup K ⊂ Ωr such that fν (wθ−1 ku) = fν (wθ−1 u) for k ∈ K,
u ∈ Ωr γ, but such that χ is not identically 1 on K. For one may choose K such
that the relevant minors of wθ−1 u and wθ−1 ku are highly congruent, and use the
Iwasawa decomposition. 
     Define a functional on X by

(3.2)                        Λχ (ν, π, θ)(f ⊗ ṽ) = lim λΩ
                                                         π,ν,θ (f ⊗ ṽ).
                                                         Ω

Again, this functional depends on the choice of wθ .
Proposition 3.5. Let Λχ (ν, π, θ) be defined as in (3.2), and extend Λχ to Xν by the
section f ⊗ ṽ 7→ fν ⊗ ṽ. Then Λχ (ν, π, θ) defines a non-zero δωχ –Bessel functional
for Πν . 
Proof. Suppose that u1 ∈ Uℓ . Since Uℓ ⊂ P ′ , we can write u1 = m1 n1 , with
m1 ∈ M ′ ∩ Uℓ , and n1 ∈ N ′ . Suppose first that u1 = n1 ∈ N ′ . Since N ′ is exhausted
by compact subgroups, we can choose Ω0 compact with n1 ∈ Ω0 . If Ω0 ⊂ Ω, then
                                                Z
               λΩ
                π,ν,θ (Πν (n1 )f      ⊗ ṽ) =       λχ (fν (wθ−1 un1 ) ⊗ ṽ)χ−1 (u) du
                                                Ω
                                 Z
                             =       λχ (fν (wθ−1 u) ⊗ ṽ)χ−1 (un−1
                                                                 1 ) du
                                 Ω
                                       = χ(n1 )λΩ
                                                π,ν,θ (f ⊗ ṽ).

Therefore,
                 Λχ (ν, π, θ)(Πν (n1 )f ⊗ ṽ) = χ(n1 )Λχ (ν, π, θ)(f ⊗ ṽ).
If u = m1 ∈ Uℓ ∩ M ′ , then since χ|G1 ∩Uℓ is ψ–generic, χwθ (m1 ) = χ(m1 ). Thus,

                    Z
                =       λχ (π(wθ−1 m1 wθ )fν (wθ−1 m−1
                                                    1 um1 ) ⊗ ṽ)χ
                                                                  −1
                                                                     (u) du

                        = χ(m1 )                λχ (fν (wθ−1 u) ⊗ ṽ)χ−1 (u) du
                                     m−1

Therefore,
                   Λχ (ν, π, θ)(Πν (m1 )f ⊗ ṽ) = χ(m1 )Λχ (ν, π, θ)(f ⊗ ṽ).
     Similarly, if m ∈ Mχ ⊂ M ′ , then

                  λΩ

                −1/2
           =   δP δP ′ (m)            λχ (fν (wθ−1 u) ⊗ ω̃(m−1 )ṽ)χ−1 (mum−1 ) du
                             m−1 Ωm
                                              −1
                               = δ(m)λm

                                              (f ⊗ ω̃(m−1 )ṽ).

Taking the limit on Ω on the right and left sides of the above equation completes the
proof that Λχ (ν, π, θ) is a Bessel functional for Πν with respect to the representation
δ(m)ωχ .
   It remains to show that Λχ (ν, π, θ) is not identically zero. Let P̄′ be the parabolic
opposite to P′ . Then P̄′ = wθ Pwθ−1 . By Lemma 3.4, P̄ ′ Km is compact, and if
pwθ−1 k ∈ P wθ−1 Km ∩ N ′ , then in fact p ∈ P ∩ Km . Choose a v ∈ Vπ and ṽ ∈ Ṽω
such that λχ (v ⊗ ṽ) 6= 0. Choose m >> 0 such that v ∈ Vπ,m and such that
χ|N ′ ∩ P̄ ′ Km ≡ 1. Consider the function in Y defined by

                            π(p)v if k = pwθ−1 k1 , p ∈ P ∩ K, k1 ∈ Km
                         
(3.3)           f0 (k) =
                            0        otherwise.

Then
                                                    Z
                    Λχ (ν, π, θ)(f0 ⊗ ṽ) =               λχ (fν (wθ−1 u) ⊗ ṽ) du
                                              N ′ ∩P̄ ′ Km
                                                      ′    ′
                                = λχ (v ⊗ ṽ) |N ∩ P̄ Km | =
                                                           6 0.

Thus, Λχ (ν, π, θ) is non-zero, and f0 is a complement to XRχ ,ω,ν,θ for all ν. 
     Suppose r = mu ∈ Rχ , f ∈ Y, and ṽ ∈ Ṽω . Define an X–valued function on a∗C
by
                   xr,f,ṽ,θ (ν) = Πν (r)(f ) ⊗ ṽ − δ(m)χ(u)(f ⊗ ω̃(m−1 )ṽ).
Theorem 3.6. The function ν 7→ Λχ (ν, π, θ)(x) is holomorphic for each x ∈ X.
Proof. We will apply Banks’s extension of Bernstein’s Theorem. Let

                       R = {(r, f ⊗ ṽ)|r ∈ Rχ , f ∈ Y, ṽ ∈ Vω̃ } ∪ {∗}.

For α = (r, f ⊗ ṽ) ∈ R, we let xα (ν) = xr,f,ṽ,θ (ν) in X and let cα (ν) = 0. Fix

|N ′ ∩ P̄ ′ Km | λχ (v ⊗ ṽ). Now for every ν ∈ a∗C , we consider the systems of equations
in X × C given by:
                               Ξ(ν) = {(xα (ν), cα (ν))| α ∈ R} .
By Lemma 3.2, the function ν 7→ xα (ν) is holomorphic for each α of the form
(r, f ⊗ ṽ). For α = ∗, the function xα (ν) = f0 ⊗ ṽ is constant on a∗C . Note that each
cα is constant, hence holomorphic as well.
    Now, for each ν the functional Λχ (ν, π, θ) is a solution to the system Ξ(ν). More-
over, such a solution is unique by the results of Section 2. Thus, Banks’s extension
of Bernstein’s theorem [Ban] implies that ν 7→ Λ(ν, π, θ)(f ⊗ ṽ) is holomorphic for
all choices of f and ṽ. 
  We turn to the question of local coefficients. Let w̃ ∈ W, and fix a representative
w for w̃ with w ∈ K. We recall that the intertwining operator

                     A(ν, π, w) : V (ν, π, θ) → V (w̃(ν), w̃π, w̃(θ))

is defined for ν >> 0 by
                                               Z
(3.4)                      A(ν, π, w)f (g) =         f (w−1 ng) dn,
                                               Nw̃

where Nw̃ = U ∩ wN̄w−1 , and N̄ is the unipotent radical opposite to N. Then
A(ν, π, w) is defined on all of a∗C by analytic continuation. Note that the intertwining
operator depends on the choice of w representing w̃.
   We also recall the Langlands decomposition of the intertwining operator, de-
scribed in Lemma 2.1.2 of [Shaa]. For the convenience of the reader, let us restate
this here. For two associate subsets θ and θ ′ of ∆, we let

                            W (θ, θ ′ ) = {w̃ ∈ W | w̃θ = θ ′ } .

Lemma 3.7 (Langlands (see [Shaa, Lemma 2.1.2])). Suppose that θ, θ ′ ⊂ ∆
are associate. Let w̃ ∈ W (θ, θ ′ ). Then there exists a family θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θn ⊂ ∆ so
that
    (1) θ1 = θ and θn = θ ′ ;
    (2) For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n there is a root αi ∈ ∆ \ θi so that θi+1 is the conjugate
        of θi in ∆i = θi ∪ {αi };
    (3) For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, we let w̃i = w̃ℓ,∆i w̃ℓ,θi in W (θi , θi+1 ). Then
        w̃ = w̃n−1 . . . w̃1 ;
    (4) Set w̃1′ = w̃, and w̃i+1
                               ′
                                 = w̃i′ w̃i−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then w̃n′ = 1 and

                              nw̃i′ = nw̃i ⊕ Ad(wi−1 )nw̃i+1
                                                         ′   .

        Here n is the Lie algebra of N.

   Let θ∗ ⊂ θ and let ρ be an irreducible supercuspidal representation of Mθ∗ . If
ρ is generic, then Rodier’s Theorem implies that there is a unique constituent π of
IndMPθ∗ (ρ) which is generic with compatible character. For this constituent, Shahidi
proved that there is a complex number Cχ (ν, π, θ, w) which satisfies
        ON LOCAL COEFFICIENTS FOR NON-GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS                            25

where Λχ is the Whittaker functional. Moreover, the function ν 7→ Cχ (ν, π, θ, w) is
a meromorphic function on (aθ )∗C . The value of the local coefficient depends on the
choice of representative w for w̃.
   Now suppose that ρ is any irreducible supercuspidal which has a minimal Bessel
model of a particular type. Then we prove a similar result for the constituent π of
IndM
   Pθ∗ (ρ) which has a Bessel model of compatible type; such a constituent exists
and is unique by Theorem 2.1.
Theorem 3.8. Let θ and θ ′ be associate subsets of ∆. Let θ∗ ⊂ θ and let ρ be an
irreducible supercuspidal representation of Mθ∗ . Suppose that ρ has an ωχ –Bessel
model which is minimal. Let π be the constituent of IndM Pθ∗ (ρ) such that π has an
  w0
ωχ -Bessel model, as in Theorem 2.1. For each w̃ ∈ W (θ, θ ′ ) fix a representative
w for w̃. Then there is a complex number Cχ (ν, π, θ, w) so that

(3.5)           Λχ (ν, π, θ) = Cχ (ν, π, θ, w)Λχ(w̃ν, w̃π, w̃θ)A(ν, π, w).

Moreover, the function ν 7→ Cχ (ν, π, θ, w) is meromorphic on a∗C , and depends only
on the class of π and the choice of w.
Proof. We first show how to define Cχ (ν̃, π, θ∗, w) for ν̃ ∈ (aθ∗ )∗C . By [Sil, Theorem
5.4.3.7] the representation I(ν̃, ρ, θ∗ ) is irreducible unless the Plancherel measure
µ(ν̃, ρ) = 0 and (ν̃, ρ) is fixed by a nontrivial element of the Weyl group Wθ∗ (i.e., is
singular). Thus, on an open dense subset of (aθ∗ )∗C the representation I(ν̃, ρ, θ∗) is
irreducible, and so Λχ (w̃ν̃, w̃ρ, w̃θ∗ )A(ν̃, ρ, w) defines a non-zero Bessel functional
on V (ν̃, ρ, θ∗ ) ⊗ Ṽω . By the uniqueness of such a functional (Theorem/Conjecture
1.4), we get the existence of C(ν̃, ρ, θ∗ , w) satisfying

               Λχ (ν̃, ρ, θ∗) = Cχ (ν̃, ρ, θ∗ , w)Λχ (w̃ν̃, w̃ρ, w̃θ∗ )A(ν̃, ρ, w)

on the open dense subset. Moreover, it is holomorphic there since both

                                      Λχ (w̃ν̃, w̃ρ, w̃θ∗ )

and A(ν̃, ρ, w) are holomorphic there. Thus, C(ν̃, ρ, θ∗, w) extends to a meromor-
phic function on (aθ∗ )∗C . Now, write w̃ = w̃n−1 . . . w̃1 as in Lemma 3.7. Since
Cχ (ν̃, ρ, θ∗ , w) is now defined, it admits a factorization compatible with the decom-
position of the intertwining operators given in Lemma 3.7. (See corollary 3.9.)
This implies that on an open dense subset of ν ∈ (aθ )∗C , the local coefficient
Cχ (ν, ρ, θ∗, w) may be defined by the equation Cχ (ν, ρ, θ∗ , w) = Cχ (ν̃, ρ, θ∗ , w),
where ν̃ is the restriction of ν to (aθ∗ )C . Suppose that, for some ν in this open
dense subset, Λχ (w̃ν, w̃π, w̃θ)A(ν, π, w) was the zero functional. Then, by induc-
ing in stages and using the discussion preceding this Theorem, we would conclude
that Λχ (w̃ν̃, w̃ρ, w̃θ∗ )A(ν̃, ρ, w) is also zero. However, since Cχ (ν̃, ρ, θ∗ , w) is de-
fined there, this would be a contradiction. Thus we may define C(ν, π, θ, w) by the
relation (3.5) on this open dense subset, and we have C(ν, π, θ, w) = C(ν̃, ρ, θ∗ , w).
Since A(ν, π, w) has a meromorphic continuation to (aθ )∗C , and Λχ (w̃ν, w̃π, w̃θ) is
holomorphic on (aθ )∗C , the function ν 7→ Cχ (ν, π, θ, w) must have a meromorphic
continuation. 

Corollary 3.9. Let the notation be as in Lemma 3.7 and Theorem 3.8. Let π1 = π,
and ν1 = ν. For each i, 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, set πi = w̃i πi−1 , νi = w̃νi−1 . Then the local
coefficient factors as

                                                 n−1
                                                 Y
                            Cχ (ν, π, θ, w) =          Cχ (πi , θi , wi ).
                                                 i=1


Proof. Let f1 = f ∈ V (ν, π, θ) and for 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1, let fi = A(νi−1 , πi−1 , wi−1 )fi−1 .
Then

                Λχ (νi , πi , θi )fi =Cχ (νi , πi , θi , wi )Λχ (νi+1 , πi+1 , θi+1 )
                                      · A(νi , πi , wi )fi ,

for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. The corollary now follows immediately from Lemma 3.7 and
iteration of the above equality. 
