                                                   Abstract. We prove that the elements A≤ defined by Lusztig in a completion of the
                                                   periodic module actually live in the periodic module (in the type A case). In order
                                                   to prove this, we compare, using the Schur duality, these elements with Kashiwara
                                                   canonical basis of an integrable module.

                                                Fix two positive integers d and p. Let V ′ ⊃ R ⊃ R+ ⊃ I = {α1 , ...αd−1 } be a
                                             R-vector space of dimension d − 1, a root system of type Ad−1 , a system of positive
                                             roots and the corresponding set of simple roots. Fix a partition c = (c1 , ...cℓ ) of d
                                             and set Ic = {αi | i 6= c1 + · · · ca , ∀a}. Let F be the set of all reflection hyperplanes
                                             Fα∨ ,n = {v ∈ V ′ | (α∨ : v) = np}, where α ∈ R+ and n ∈ Z. Set Fc = {Fα∨ ,n | α ∈
                                             R+ ∩ Ic } ⊂ F . We call alcoves the connected components of V ′ \ ∪F ∈F F. Let A′+
                                             be the only alcove contained in the dominant Weyl chamber having 0 in its closure.
                                             Let Ac be the set of alcoves contained in the connected component of V ′ \ ∪F ∈Fc F
                                             which contains A′+ . Finally, let Mc be the Z[q, q −1 ]-span of the alcoves in Ac . It is
                                             a H′ × R′c -module, where H′ is the affine Hecke algebra associated to R, and R′c
                                             is a Laurent polynomial algebra over ℓ variables. In [L5, 9.17(a)] Lusztig defines,
                                             for any A ∈ Ac , some element A≤ in a completion of Mc and he conjectures in
                                             [L5, 12.7] that A≤ ∈ Mc (the conjecture is stated for all types). If c = (1d ), the
                                             conjecture follows from results in [L1]. In this paper we prove it for all c in Theorem
                                             5.5.
                                                In [L5, 17.3] two conjectural multiplicity formulas for modules of a simple Lie
                                             algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p are given. They are
                                             formulated via some element A≥ and it involves polynomials πAB , the coefficients
                                             of the expansion of A≥ in the basis of the alcoves, [L5, 9.17(c),(d)]. Using Theorem
                                             5.5 and [L5, Proposition 12.9] we get that for all A, there exist only finitely many
                                             non-zero polynomials πAB .
                                                The main tools of the proof are the Schur duality (in its quantum affine version)
                                             and a theorem of Kashiwara yielding a canonical basis for some integrable module
                                             N of the quantum affine loop algebra of glp (here p > d). More precisely we write
                                             down a H′ × R′c -isomorphism which sends a H′ × R′c -cyclic submodule of Mc into
                                             a weight space of N and takes {A≤ } into Kashiwara’s canonical basis.
                                                This work is motivated by [VV3]. In loc.cit. the authors give a geometric
                                             construction, via quiver varieties, of the (signed) canonical basis of the module
                                             N(λc ). This construction is very similar to Lusztig’s conjectural construction of

the (signed) canonical basis in the K-theory of the Springer fiber (see [L4, L5],
where it is also explained the link between this K-theory object and the periodic
module). It is known that, for type A, the Springer fibers are quiver varieties.
Probably it is possible to check that both signed bases coincide via their geometric
characterization. In this paper we give an elementary algebraic proof.
   Aknowledgements. The idea to compare the elements A≤ with the Kashiwara’s
canonical basis is due to E. Vasserot. I thank him to share it with me. This work
started during my stay at the M.S.R.I. in March 2002. I thank the organizers of
the program ”Infinite-dimensional algebras and Mathematical Physics” for inviting
me.

                                      1. Notations
1.1. Let T ⊂ GLd be a maximal torus. Let X = X(T) be the caracter group of T,
and let R(T) be its representation ring. The dual group of one parameter subgroups
of T is denoted by X∨ . Set ( : ) equal to the canonical pairing X × X∨ → Z. Set
R ⊂ X equal to the set of root of gld with respect to T. Choose a positive system
R+ ⊂ R. Let I ⊂ R+ be the set of simple roots and let Q ⊂ X be the root lattice.
We fix basis elements ε1 , ..., εd ∈ X such that I = {αi = εi −εi+1 | i = 1, 2, ..., d −1}.
For i = 1, ..., d set ωi = ε1 + · · · + εi ∈ X with i = 1, ..., d. Let {ωi∨ }, {ε∨      ∨
                                                                                 i } ⊂ X be
the dual bases. Put θ ∨ = α∨               ∨         ∨      ∨     ∨
                               1 +· · ·+αd−1 , and αi = εi −εi+1 with i = 1, 2, ..., d −1.
                                                                                  Pd−1
Let ≤ be the partial order on X such that µ ≤ ν if and only if ν − µ ∈ i=1 N αi .
1.2. Let Wf be the Weyl group of gld . Let W = Wf ⋉ X, W′ = Wf ⋉ Q, be the
extended affine Weyl group and the affine Weyl group. For any w ∈ Wf , λ ∈ X we
use the following notations : w = (w, 0), τλ = (0, λ).
   APcomposition of d is a ℓ-uple of non-negative integers f = (f1 , f2 , ...fℓ ) such
that i fi = d, for some ℓ. It is a partition if and only if f1 ≥ f2 ≥ · · · ≥ fℓ ≥ 0.
For any composition f of d, set If = {αi ∈ I | i 6= f1 + f2 + · · · + fa , ∀a}. Let
Wf be the corresponding parabolic subgroup of Wf , i.e. Wf = hsi | αi ∈ If i. Put
Wf′ = Wf ⋉ ZIf . Let Wf (resp. f W)⊂ Wf be the set of all elements w having a
minimal length in the coset wWf (resp. Wf w). Let wd , wf be the longest elements
of Wf , Wf . Set νd = ℓ(wd ), νf = ℓ(wf ).
   Let s1 , s2 , ..., sd be the simple affine reflections in W′ such that si = sα∨i if i 6= d
and sd = τθ sθ∨ , where for any root α ∈ R, sα∨ is the corresponding reflection.
Let π denote the element τω1 s1 s2 · · · sd−1 . The cyclic group of infinite order hπi is
isomorphic to X/Q and W is isomorphic to a semi-direct product hπi ⋉ W′ .
1.3. Fix a positive number, say p. Set V = X ⊗Z R,
                      A+ = {γ ∈ V | p > (γ : α∨ ) > 0, ∀α ∈ R+ },
                     Xp = {γ ∈ X | p ≥ (γ : ε∨
                                             i ) > 0, ∀i = 1, ...d}.
The group W acts on X as follows
                     γ · si = γ − (γ : α∨
                                        i ) αi    if i = 1, 2, ..., d − 1,
                     γ · τν = γ − pν              if ν ∈ X.
Note that
    - the set Ā+ ∩ Xp is a fundamental domain for the right action of W on X (Ā+
is the closure of A+ in V ),
    - for all µ ∈ Ā+ ∩ Xp , We is the isotropy group of µ, if e is associated to µ as in
(1.4.1).

1.4. Conventions.
   (1) In the future we will use both weights of glp and gld . The fundamental
weights and the simple roots of glp are denoted by Λi , i = 1, ..., p and βi = ǫi − ǫi+1 ,
i = 1, ..., p − 1, respectively. The affine simple roots of glp are β1 , ..., βp . Set

d2 ≥ · · · ≥ dp ≥ 0, a=1 di = d. Set d = (dp , ..., d1 ) and let c = (c1 , c2 , ..., cℓ ) be
the partition dual to d, that is ci = |{j |Pdj ≥ i}|. Then c = (pℓp ...2ℓ2 1ℓ1 ), for some
                                              p
positive integers ℓ1 , ..., ℓp such that ℓ = a=1 ℓa . We have

(1.4.1)     µ̃ =    a=1 ea ǫa    ∈ X̃ with ea = |{i | bi = a}|,                e = (ep , ..., e2 , e1 ).

Set
          Pp                                  P                       Pp

where e is as in (1.4.1). The composition e is said small if ea = 0, 1 for all a. The
map µ 7→ µ̃ restricts to a bijection Ā+ ∩ Xp → Ω which takes A+ ∩ Xp onto Ωsm .
From now on if µ̃ ∈ Ω (resp. Ωsm ), then µ denotes the unique preimage in Ā+ ∩ Xp
(resp. A+ ∩ Xp ).

                                          2. q-Notations

2.1. Put A = Q[q, q           ], K = Q(q), A0 = {f ∈ K |f is without pole at q = 0}. Set

 R = Z[X] ⊗ A,          Rc = Z[X/ZIc ] ⊗ A,            R′ = Z[Q] ⊗ A,          R′c = Z[Q/ZIc ] ⊗ A.

We identify R with the polynomial ring A[x±1      1 ,xP

                                                                                Q

Then Rc is identified with the quotient of R by the ideal generated by the relations

R′ → R′c , cf. [L5, 8.3]. We have

by πi ea , πi fa , πi , i ∈ Np , a = 1, 2, ...p, with πi πj = δij πi , see [L2, 23.1] for a precise
definition. Let U, U̇ be the A-forms of UK , U̇K . Then U is the A-subalgebra of
                           (n)   (n)
UK generated by ea , fa , la±1 , and U̇ is the A-subalgebra of U̇K generated by
    (n)       (n)
πi ea , πi fa .
    Let x 7→ x be the ring homomorphism of U such that q̄ = q −1 , ēa = ea ,
f¯a = fa , ¯la = la−1 . We will still denote by x 7→ x the involution on U̇ which is also
characterized by πi = πi .
Remark. Kashiwara’s canonical bases are defined for the quantum loop algebra
of slp . In this paper we will use the glp -version. It is irrelevant since an integrable
U-module is a module for the quantum loop algebra of slp together with an extra
grading coming from the action of the la ’s.
2.3. Let H be the affine Hecke algebra of GLd . Recall that H is the unital asso-
ciative A-algebra generated by elements t1 ,...td−1 , x±1     ±1
                                                       1 ,...xd , modulo the relations

                     (ti + q −1 )(ti − q) = 0,
                     ti ti+1 ti = ti+1 ti ti+1 ,       |i − j| ≥ 2 ⇒ ti tj = tj ti ,
                     xi x−1
                          i   = 1 = x−1i xi ,          xi xj = xj xi ,
                     ti xi ti = xi+1 ,                 j 6= i, i + 1 ⇒ ti xj = xj ti .

For any w ∈ W let tw be the corresponding element in H. To simplify we set
π = tπ (= x1 t1 t2 · · · td−1 ). Set also td = πtd−1 π −1 . Let H′ , Hf ⊂ H be the A-
subalgebras generated by t1 , ...td and t1 , ...td−1 respectively. We will identify, in
the obvious way, R with the sub-A-algebra of H generated by the x±1         i ’s. Note
         ′                                                                ′
that H is the sub-A-algebra of H generated by t1 , ...td−1 and by R . For future
references, we point out that xα is equal to the element θ−α in Lusztig’s papers.
   Let t 7→ t̄ be the ring homomorphism of H such that q̄ = q −1 , t̄i = t−1 i , π̄ = π,
i = 1, ..., d.

2.4. For any composition f of d, let Hf ⊆ Hf be the subalgebra generated by the
elements ti with αi ∈ If . Similarly, let H′f ⊆ H′ be the subalgebra generated by Hf
and the elements x±1
                   αi with i ∈ If . Set also
                             X                        X
                     ρf =        q ℓ(w) tw ,   mf =        q 2ℓ(w) .
                                w∈Wf                           w∈Wf

We get ρ2f = mf ρf and ρf = q −2νf ρf .
2.5. Set A− equal to the unique left representation of H′ on A taking the elements
ti to −q −1 Id , for all i = 1, ...d. Note that, in particular,

(2.5.1).                        xαi · 1 = q 2 · 1      for all αi ∈ I

2.6. For any pair of compositions f , f ′ of d with at most p parts, let Hf ,f ′ be the
                                            P      ℓ(w)
      L span of the elements tm = w∈m q
A-linear                                                  tw , where m ∈ Wf \W/Wf ′ . Let
Sd = f ,f ′ Hf ,f the q-affine Schur algebra. The product in Sd is defined by setting
                  ′

tm ⋆ tn = δ(f ′ , g)m−1  f ′ tm tn for all m ∈ Wf \W/Wf , n ∈ Wg \W/Wg . Consider
                                                              ′                  ′

the algebra homomorphism χd : U̇ → Sd , defined in [SV, Proposition 2.4]. In
particular it takes πi to ρi♯ , if i♯ is a composition of d, and πi 7→ 0 otherwise.
Here i♯ = (i1 , i2 , ...) and ir = |i−1 (r)|. Let χf ,f ′ : U̇ → Hf ,f ′ be the composition
of χd with the canonical projection Sd → Hf ,f ′ . The A-module Sd has a basis,
B = {bs | s ∈ Ad }, where Ad is the following subset of the set of Z × Z matrices
with entries in N,
                                                                 p
                                                                XX
                  Ad = {s = (sij )i,j∈Z | si+p,j+p = sij ,                 sij = d},
                                                                 i∈Z j=1

see [SV, 3.2]. Then [L6, Theorem 8.2] states that B ap = {bs | s ∈ Aap
                                                                    d } is a A-basis
of Im (χd ), with

                  Aap
                   d = {s ∈ Ad | ∀j ∈ Z \ {0}, ∃i ∈ Z and si,i+j = 0}.

For a future use let us mention the following.
Claim. If p > d and f is small, the map χf ,f ′ is surjective for all f ′ . If p = d and
f , f ′ are small, then B ∩ Hf ,f ′ = (B ap ∩ Hf ,f ′ ) ∪ {ρf π r | r ∈ Z}.
Proof. Set f = (f1 , ..., fp ), f ′ = (f1′ , ..., fp′ ). Then
                                                X                X
  bs ∈ Hf ,f ′ ⇔ s ∈ Af ,f ′ = {s ∈ Ad |              sij = fi ,   sij = fj′ , ∀i, j ∈ {1, 2, ...p}}.
                                              j∈Z             i∈Z

Suppose that p ≥ d. If f is small, a direct computation gives

                       Af ,f ′ ∩ Aap            ′
                                  d 6= Af ,f ⇔ f is small and p = d.
                                            ′



This proves the first part of the claim. If p = d and f , f ′ are both small, we have

                         Af ,f ′ \ (Af ,f ′ ∩ Aap
                                               d ) = {s(r) | r ∈ Z \ {0}},

with s(r) = (sij )i,j∈Z such that sij 6= 0 ⇔ j − i = r. Moreover bs(r) = ρf π r , see
[SV, 3.2].                                                                         ⊓⊔

                             3. Kashiwara modules
3.1. Let V be any integrable U-module and let z be a formal variable. Set
U[z ±1 ] = U ⊗A A[z ±1 ]. We denote by V{z} be the representation of U on the
space V ⊗A A[z ±1 ] such that x±              ±    r    ±      ±     r
                                ir acts as xir ⊗ z and kir as kir ⊗ z (in particular
                  δap                  −δap
ea acts as ea ⊗ z     and fa as fb ⊗ z      ). Define

              V⊗d {z1 , z2 ...zd } = V{z1 } ⊗A V{z2 } ⊗A · · · ⊗A V{zd }.

The element Λ ∈ X̃ is a weight of V if the Λ-weight subspace

                   VΛ = {v ∈ V | la · v = q (Λ:ǫa ) v, ∀a = 1, ..., p}

is non-zero. If v ∈ VΛ we set wt(v) = Λ.
3.2. Let W(Λa ), V(Λa ) be the A-form of the fundamental UK -module and of
Kashiwara’s maximal integrable UK -module, respectively, with highest weight Λa ,
see [K1], [K2]. Fix highest weight vectors wΛa ∈ W(Λa ), vΛa ∈ V(Λa ). By [K2,
Theorem 5.15(viii)] there exists a U-automorphism z of V(Λa ) and an isomorphism
of U[z ±1 ]-modules
                                         ∼
(3.2.1)                          V(Λa ) → W(Λa )[z]

such that vΛa 7→ wΛa ⊗ 1. In particular we have the U[z1±1 , ..., zd±1 ]-isomorphism

                        V(Λ1 )⊗d ≃ W(Λ1 )⊗d {z1 , z2 , ..., zd }.

Both modules V(Λa ), W(Λa ) have canonical bases B(Λa ), Bf (Λa ), see [K1, Propo-
sition 8.2.2] and [K2, Theorem 5.15(ii)]. There is a unique U-semilinear (with
respect to x 7→ x) and Q[z ±1 ]-linear involution on V(Λa ) which fixes vΛa . The
elements in B(Λa ) are fixed by this involution. Via (3.2.1), we have
                                        G
(3.2.2)                      B(Λa ) =         Bf (Λa ) ⊗ z n .
                                        n∈Z


Let L(Λa ) be the A0 -lattice spanned by B(Λa ).
3.3. Let V be the vectorial representation of U, i.e. V is the U[z ±1 ]-module with
A-basis {um | m ∈ Z} such that um−pℓ = um · z ℓ for all m, ℓ ∈ Z, and such that U
acts as follows (a = 1, 2, ..., p)

ea (um ) = δ(m ≡ a + 1)um−1 ,     fa (um ) = δ(m ≡ a)um+1 ,         la (um ) = q δ(m≡a) um .

Here again we write a ≡ b for a − b ∈ pZ. The U-module V has a X̃a -graduation
such that wta (um−pl ) = ǫm + lδ, for all m = 1, 2, ..., p.
Lemma.
  (1) In V we have h1,1 (u1 ) = o(1)(−1)1−p q −p u1 · z.
  (2) There is a unique isomorphism of U[z ±1 ]-modules V(Λ1 ) → V such that
      vΛ1 7→ u1 .
  (3) B(Λ1 ) = {um | m ∈ Z}.

Proof. For Claim 1, recall that h1,1 = k1−1 [x+  1,1 , f1 ]. Then use a computation as
in [VV1, Theorem 3.3] (but note that we use a different coproduct and different
Drinfeld generators). Claim (2) follows from Claim (1) and from [N, Proposition
3.1]. Claim (3) follows from (3.2.2) and standard properties of canonical bases. ⊓  ⊔
                                                                            P
   From now on we identify V(Λ1 ) with V. For v = ⊗i vi ∈ V⊗d and γ = i mi εi ∈
X, put v · zγ = ⊗i (vi · z mi ). Let {uγ | γ ∈ X} be the unique A-basis of V⊗d such
that                               Nd
                       uγ−pν = ( i=1 umi ) · zν ,        γ, ν ∈ X.
Note that, if γ ∈ Xp , ν ∈ X, then wt(uγ−pν ) = γ̃. The set of weights of V⊗d is
                                                                         Pd
exactly Ω. We have a X̃a -graduation on V⊗d such that wta (uγ−pν ) = γ̃ + i=1 ni δ
      Pd
if ν = i=1 ni εi .
3.4. Consider the right representation of the A-algebra H on V⊗d such that for all
i = 1, 2, ...d − 1,γ ∈ Xp , κ, ν ∈ X,
                                
                                 quγ                   if γ · si = γ
(3.4.1)              uγ ⋄ ti = uγ·si                    if γ · si < γ ,
                                
                                  uγ·si + (q − q −1 )uγ if γ · si > γ
                                      uν ⋄ xκ = uν·τκ .
                                                                                   L
This action commutes with the U-action, see [VV2] for instance. Set Td = g ρg H
where g runs into the set of the compositions of d with at most p parts. It is a left
Sd -module such that t ⋆ h = δ(f ′ , g)m−1  g th ∈ ρf H for all t ∈ Hf ,f ′ and h ∈ ρg H.
Define an involution ιS on Sd by setting ιS (a) = q 2νf ′ a, for all a ∈ Hf ,f ′ .
Lemma.
  (1) There is a unique isomorphism of right H-modules
                            ∼
                    φ : V⊗d → Td ,    uµ 7→ ρe ,              ∀ µ ∈ Ā+ ∩ Xp .
          In particular
                                                   ∼

                                                    → ρe H.

   (2) There exists a unique A-algebra homomorphism Φd : U̇ → Sd such that
       φ(uv) = Φd (u) ⋆ φ(v), for all u ∈ U̇, v ∈ V⊗d . We have ιS (Φd (u)) = Φd (u).
   (3) uµ ⋄ tw = uµ·w for all µ ∈ Ā+ ∩ X and w ∈ e W.
Proof. For Claims (1) and (2) use [VV2, Lemmas 8.3 and 8.4]. Note that the
coproduct in loc.cit. is different from our.
    Claim (3) is standard, we prove it by induction on the lenght of w. Set w = si .
Since µ ∈ Ā+ , we have (µ : α∨ i ) ≥ 0, and the equality holds if and only if si ∈ We .
Then µ · si < µ and uµ ⋄ ti = uµ·si . Suppose now that ℓ(w) = k > 1 and write w =
w′ si with ℓ(w′ ) = k − 1. Then w′ ∈ e W. Otherwise there exists σ ∈ We such that
ℓ(σw′ ) < ℓ(w′ ) and then ℓ(w) < ℓ(σw) = ℓ(σw′ ) ± 1 ≤ ℓ(w′ ), which is impossible,
because w ∈ e W. So, by induction, uµ ⋄ tw = uµ·w′ ⋄ ti . Since w′ (αi ) ∈ R+ , we have
(µ · w′ : α∨             ′  ∨                  ′   ∨
           i ) = (µ : w (αi )) ≥ 0. If (µ · w : αi ) = 0, then sw ′ (αi ) ∈ We . Thus
w = sw′ (αi ) w is an element of We w such that ℓ(w′ ) < ℓ(w) which is impossible by
  ′

assumption.                                                                           ⊓
                                                                                      ⊔
   Note that the map Φd defined in the lemma above is a renormalization of the
map χd in 2.6. It is easy to check that the Claim in section 2.6 still hold for Φf ,f ′ ,
the composition of Φd with the canonical projection Sd → Hf ,f ′ .

3.5. Taking d = 1 in (3.4.1) we get vΛ1 ⋄ x1 = vΛ1 · z, because vΛ1 = u1 . So x1
acts as Kashiwara’s operator z on V. The module W(Λ1 ) is identified with the
subspace of V spanned by u1 , ..., up . Then, formulas (3.4.1) endow W(Λ1 ) with a
right Hf -action, such that, if p > d, W(Λ1 )⊗d ⊗Hf A− is a simple module of the
quantum enveloping algebra of glp with highest weight Λd . Set

                 V[d] = W(Λ1 )⊗d {(−q)1−d z1 , (−q)3−d , · · · , (−q)d−1 zd }.

Take c = (d), then Rc = A[ψ(x1 )]. We can endow V[d] ⊗H′ A− with a (right)-Rc -
action by setting
                         (v ⊗ 1) · ψ(x1 ) = (v ⋄ x1 ) ⊗ 1,
for all v ∈ V[d] . It is well defined by (2.1.1), (2.5.1).
Proposition. Assume that p > d and let λ̃ = Λd . Then c = (d), ρd = 1. Set
x = ψ((−q)1−d x1 ).
    (1) There is a unique isomorphism of U-modules
                  ∼

    (2) The set of the weights of V(Λd ) is Ωsm . Fix µ̃ ∈ Ωsm . The map (3.5.1) takes
        B(Λd )µ̃ to {(uµ ⊗ 1) · xi | i ∈ Z}.

Proof. Claim (1). There exists α ∈ A× such that (W(Λ1 )⊗d ⊗Hf A− ){αz} ≃
V(Λd ), because W(Λ1 )⊗d ⊗Hf A− and W(Λd ) are both integral A-forms of simple
UK -modules which are simple and of highest weight Λd as modules for the quantum
enveloping algebra of glp . By (2.1.1) we have Rc = A[x±1 ]. Consider the U-module
W(Λ1 )⊗d {αz1 , q 2 αz2 , ...q 2(d−1) αzd } ⊗H′ A− . The element fp ∈ U acts as

A = o(d)(−1)1−p q −p . Using a computation as in [VV1, Theorem 3.3] we get

               hd,1 (ud ⊗ · · · ⊗ u1 ⊗ 1) = (−q)d−1 Aud ⊗ · · · ⊗ u1 ⋄ x1 ⊗ 1.

Then use [N, Proposition 3.1] to get α = (−q)1−d .
   Claim (2). If µ ∈ (Ā+ \ A+ ) ∩ Xp , then the element uµ ⊗ 1 ∈ V[d] ⊗H′ A− is zero
since quµ ⊗1 = uµ ⋄ti ⊗1 = uµ ⊗(ti ·1) = −q −1 uµ ⊗1, for any i ∈ {1, 2, ...d−1} such
that µi = µi+1 . Thus Ωsm is the set of weights of V(Λd ). Since fa2 acts trivially on
V(Λd ), Kashiwara’s operator f˜a coincide with fa , for all a. Hence B(Λd )+qL(Λd ) ∋
fa1 · · · far (vΛd ) = uµ or 0 with µ ∈ A+ ∩ Xp , for any a1 , ..., ar 6= p. We are done by
(3.2.2).                                                                                  ⊓

   It is convenient to identify the ring A[z1 , ..., zℓ ] with the quotient of the poly-
nomial algebra A[z1 , ..., zd ] by the ideal generated by the relations zαi = 1, for all
αi ∈ Ic . Let zγ+ZIc be the image of zγ in this quotient. Using Proposition 3.5 we
get a morphism of U-modules

             N [ci ]
for all v ∈     V , γ ∈ X. It is well defined by (2.1.1), (2.5.1). Via (3.4.2), we get
also, for all e, a right action of Rc on ρe H ⊗H′c A− .
Corollary. Assume that p > d.

3.7. Let N(λ̃) ⊂ Vc be the smallest U × Rc -submodule containing the element

If µ̃ is small, we have Φe,d (U̇) = He,d = Hρd , by Claim 2.6 and the equality
ρe = 1. Claim (2) easily follows.                                            ⊓
                                                                             ⊔

                                 4. Periodic modules
4.1. Set V ′ := Q ⊗Z R, Fα∨ ,n = {γ ∈ V ′ | (α∨S: γ) = np} for all α ∈ R+ , n ∈ Z.
The connected components of the open set V ′ \ α∈R+ ,n∈Z Fα∨ ,n are called alcoves.
                                                  S
The connected components of the open set V ′ \ i<d,n∈Z Fα∨i ,n are called boxes.
We denote by A the set of alcoves. Consider the restriction to V ′ of the right action
of W′ ⊂ W on V. It induces a right W′ -action on A, denoted by A 7→ A · w, which
is simply transitive. Let A′+ be the unique alcove contained in the dominant Weyl
chamber having 0 in its closure. Thus, A′+ = A+ ∩ V ′ . We define a left W′ -action
on A by
                       w · (A′+ · v) = A′+ · wv,  ∀v, w ∈ W′ .
We denote by ≤ the partial order on A defined in [L1, 1.5].
4.2. We now consider the parabolic case.   S Fix c as in Convention 1.4. The con-
nected components of the open set V ′ \ α∈R+ ∩Ic ,n∈Z Fα∨ ,n are called Ic -alcoves.
Let Sc be the unique Ic -alcove containing A′+ . Set Ac ⊆ A equal to the set of
alcoves contained in Sc .
   Let Mc be the free A-module on Ac . There is a unique left action of H′ on Mc
such that
                     −1
                     −q A                    if si · A ∈
                                                        / Ac
           ti · A = s i · A                   if si · A > A, si · A ∈ Ac
                    
                      si · A + (q − q −1 )A   if si · A < A, si · A ∈ Ac ,

for all A ∈ Ac , i = 1, 2, ...d, see [L5, 9.3.(b)].
   By [L5, Lemma 9.6(b)] we have A′+ · w = tw · A′+ , for all w ∈ Wc . For any γ ∈ Q
there is a unique element wγ ∈ Wc′ such that Sc − pγ = Sc · wγ , because Wc′ acts
simply transitively on the set of Ic -alcoves. Thus the map A 7→ (A − pγ) · wγ−1
permutes the alcoves in Ac . Let gγ : Mc → Mc be corresponding A-linear map.
Then

       gγ (A′+ ) = (−q)−(γ:αc ) xγ · A′+ ,   gγ (h′ A′+ ) = h′ gγ (A′+ ),            ∀h′ ∈ H′ ,

see [L5, 9.2 and Lemma 9.5]. Consider the unique right R′c -action on Mc such that

                  A · xγ+ZIc = (−1)(γ:αc ) gγ (A),            ∀A ∈ A′c , ∀γ ∈ Q

belongs to Mc because Wd σc ⊂ Wc , see [L5, Lemma 13.9.(b)]. Let M′c ⊂ Mc be the
H′ ⊗ R′c -submodule generated by mc . Since, for all w ∈ Wd , ℓ(σc ) = ℓ(wσc ) + ℓ(w)
we get                       X
                mc = q −νd       q ℓ(w) t̄wσc A′+ = q −νd ρd t̄σc · A′+ .

The right Rc -action on H ⊗H′c A− defined in 3.6 restricts to a right R′c -action on
H′ ⊗H′c A− .
Lemma.

  (2) The linear map

      b : Mc → H′ ⊗H′c A−          (A′+ · w) · xγ+ZIc 7→ (tw ⊗ 1) · ψ(q −(γ:αc ) xγ ),

       where w ∈ Wc , γ ∈ Q, is a morphism of H′ ×R′c -modules such that b(mc ) =
       q −νd ρd t̄σc ⊗ 1.
   (3) The map b yields a commutative square of H′ ⊗ R′c -modules

Proof. Claim (1) follows from [L3, 2.12(f ), 4.9(c)] and the identity wd Wc wc = Wc .
As for Claims (2) and (3), use [L5, 9.7(b) and Proposition 8.5, Lemma 10.2].      ⊓

obvious way to Mc,≤ .

γ ∈ Q, w ∈ Wc . Thus dµ̃ (A) = (uµ ⋄ tw ⊗ 1) · zγ+ZIc and Claim 2 follows from

the intersection of N(λ̃) with the A-span of {uγ ⊗ 1 | γ ∈ X }.
Proof. First of all, wta (uγ1 ) = wta (uγ2 ) iff γ1 ∈ γ2 · W′ , for any γ1 , γ2 ∈ X. Namely,
write γi = νi − pµi with νi ∈ Xp , µi ∈ X. Then wta (uγ1 ) = wta (uγ2 ) iff µ1 − µ2 ∈ Q
and ν̃1 = ν̃2 i.e. ν1 = ν2 · w for some w ∈ Wf , hence iff γ1 = γ2 · wτµ1 −µ2 ·w and
µ1 − µ2 · w ∈ Q.

and Lemma 3.4(1). We have aµ̃−1 (N′ (λ̃)µ̃ ) = H′ ρd tσc R′c ⊗ 1 since aµ̃−1 (N′ (λ̃)µ̃ ) =
(ρe H′ ⊗H′c A− ) ∩ (Hρd tσc Rc ⊗1). Hence N′ (λ̃)µ̃ is a right R′c -module by the lemma
above and (3.4.1), and a left H′ -module. We have dµ̃ (M′c ) = aµ̃ (H′ ρd tσc R′c ⊗ 1) =
N′ (λ̃)µ̃ . Let cµ̃ be the inverse map cµ̃ : N′ (λ̃)µ̃ → M′c . It is an isomorphism of
H′ ⊗ R′c -modules.
5.5. We can now prove Conjecture 5.1.
Theorem. BM is a A-basis of M′c for all p > d.
Proof. Let µ̃ ∈ Ωsm . Set h = q −νd ρd tσc . We consider h as an element of ρe H ⊂ Td .
Define vc,µ̃ = aµ̃ (h ⊗ 1). Then

             vc,µ̃ = uµ ⋄ h ⊗ 1 = uµ ⋄ q −νd ρd tσc ⊗ 1 = dµ̃ (mc ) ∈ N′ (λ̃)µ̃ .

The element vc = aλ̃ (q νd ρd tσc ⊗ 1) = uλ ⋄ q −νd tσc ⊗ 1 ∈ N′ (λ̃)λ̃ is fixed by ιN .
Hence ιN (vc,µ̃ ) = vc,µ̃ , because vc,µ̃ = ρd ⋆ vc and ιS (ρd ) = ρd .
   For any v ∈ N′ (λ̃)µ̃ there exists u ∈ U̇ and r ∈ R′c such that v = uvc,µ̃ · r,
since Φe,d (U̇) ⋆ (q −νd ρd tσc ⊗ 1) ⊆ Φe,e (U̇) ⋆ (h ⊗ 1), by Claim 2.6. We want to
prove that cµ̃ is compatible with the involutions ιN , ιM . By (5.1.1), (5.2.1) and the
R′c -linearity of cµ̃ , we can forget r. We have cµ̃ (uvc,µ̃ ) = Φe,e (u) · mc . Namely, set
t = Φe,e (u). Then aµ̃ (uvc,µ̃ ) = aµ̃ (t ⋆ (uµ ⋄ h ⊗ 1)) = aµ̃ (uµ ⋄ th ⊗ 1) = th = b(t · mc ).

      Using 5.1.1, 5.2.1, and Lemma 3.4(2) we get
                           cµ̃ (ιN (uvc,µ̃ ))   =     cµ̃ (uvc,µ̃ )
                                                =   Φe,e (u) · mc
                                                = ιS (Φe,e (u)) · mc
                                                =   Φe,e (u) · mc
                                                = ιM (Φe,e (u) · mc )
                                                = ιM (cµ̃ (uvc,µ̃ )).
                                  ′
      Hence any element in cµ̃ (BN,µ̃ ) is fixed by ιM . Claim 2 in 5.3 gives
                                                    X
                         cµ̃ (N′ (λ̃)µ̃ ∩ Lc,≤ ) ⊆       Q[q −1 ]A.

                          ′
Thus, by Lemma 5.1, cµ̃ (BN,µ̃ ) ⊆ BM . We are done since cµ̃ is invertible .                 ⊓
                                                                                              ⊔
Remarks.
  (1) As a corollary of Theorem 5.5 and [L5, 15.13], the set B±     Be in [L5, 5.11] is a
      signed basis of the K-theory of the Springer fiber.
  (2) Even in the A2 case the two orders are not comparable via dµ̃ . Fix d = 3, p >
      3, c = (13 ), and µ = 3ε1 + 2ε2 + ε3 . Then dµ̃ (A′+ ) = uµ , dµ̃ (A′+ · w) = uµ·w ,
      for any w ∈ Wf .
          - If w = s2 , we have that A′+ · w < A′+ , but uµ 6<c uµ·w .
          - If w = sθ∨ τ−α1 −2α2 , we have uµ <c uµ·w but A′+ 6< A′+ · w, since A′+ · w
      is not in the Weyl chamber.
