                                                     infinitely many left cells but they all form only three two-sided cells.




                                                                                 1. Introduction
                                                   A Coxeter group is said to be right-angled if for any two distinct simple
                                             reﬂections their product has order 2 or ∞. Due to their special properties and
                                             rich structure, right-angled Coxeter groups often arise in diﬀerent geometric and
                                             algebraic problems. In a sense, the most interesting right-angled Coxeter groups
                                             are those which can be presented as groups generated by reﬂections in hyperbolic
                                             spaces. Examples of geometric applications of such groups can be found in [D],
                                             [MV], [BGI]. These groups also occur as Weyl groups of certain Kac–Moody Lie
                                             algebras [KP]. We are interested in the representations of right-angled Coxeter
                                             groups W and the corresponding Hecke algebras H.
                                                   An important diﬀerence between hyperbolic reﬂection groups and aﬃne or
                                             ﬁnite Coxeter groups is that the former do not usually have a local system of
                                             generators in the sense of [OV]. In particular, the groups Pn (see 3.1) that are gen-
                                             erated by reﬂections in the hyperbolic plane about the sides of right-angled n-gons
                                             can be called anti-local since only adjacent generators in the canonical system of
                                             simple reﬂections commute. This means that we can hardly hope to construct the
                                             representations of these groups inductively using the approach suggested in [OV].
                                             At the same time, we can still use the global methods of [KL] and try to describe
                                             the Kazhdan–Lusztig cells in our groups. It appears that certain symmetries of
                                             the initial groups are reﬂected in the structure of the partitions into cells making
                                             the cells trackable. Our main results concern the groups Pn but the methods can
                                             be applied to the other right-angled Coxeter groups as well.
                                                   We show that the partition of the group Pn (n ≥ 5) into left cells consists
                                             of inﬁnitely many elements and give an explicit description of the cells. At the

same time, all the left cells in our groups form precisely three two-sided cells (one
of which is, of course, the trivial cell). It was ﬁrst shown in [B] that the number
of one-sided cells of a hyperbolic Coxeter group can be inﬁnite, but there the
author used an implicit argument and obtained only a conjectural structure of the
corresponding cell-partitions (see also [C] for discussion). The fact that inﬁnitely
many left cells can still fall into ﬁnitely many two-sided equivalence classes and
hence give rise to only ﬁnitely many H-bimodules seems to have been previously
unnoticed.
      The explicit description of the cells makes it possible to consider correspond-
ing representations of the Coxeter groups and their Hecke algebras. Here we only
start the related analysis leaving more detailed considerations for the future. We
discuss the representations using W -graphs which were also introduced in [KL].
      While working on this paper, I enjoyed the hospitality of the MPIM in Bonn.
I wish to thank A. Vershik for several helpful discussions. V. Ostrik read an early
version of the paper and gave me some important suggestions. Finally I am grateful
to W. Casselman for his response on my submission to arXiv and lots of email
conversations.

                                2. Preliminaries
     We recall some well-known facts about Coxeter groups and Hecke algebras
associated with them. The basic reference is the fundamental paper [KL]. All the
material cited here can be also found in the book [H].

2.1. Let W be a Coxeter group and let S be the corresponding set of simple
reﬂections. With some ambiguity of language we shall also call by Coxeter group
the Coxeter system (W, S). The Hecke algebra H over the ring A = Z[q 1/2 , q −1/2 ]
of Laurent polynomials in q 1/2 is deﬁned as follows. As an A-module, H is free
with basis Tw (w ∈ W ), the multiplication is deﬁned by
                     Tw Tw′ = Tww′ , if l(ww′ ) = l(w) + l(w′ ),
                     Ts2 = q + (q − 1)Ts , if s ∈ S,
where l(w) is the length of w in (W, S).
    It will be also convenient to deﬁne
                                 Tew = q −l(w)/2 Tw .

2.2. Let a → a be the involution of the ring A deﬁned by q 1/2 = q −1/2 . This
extends to an involution h → h of the ring H given by
                            X            X
                                aw T w =    aw Tw−1 .

        Let ≤ be the Bruhat order on W (see [H], Ch. 5.9). Denote, as usual, qw =
q l(w) , ǫw = (−1)l(w) for all w ∈ W . In [KL] it was shown that for any w ∈ W there
       CELLS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF RIGHT-ANGLED COXETER GROUPS                      3


exists a unique element element Cw ∈ H such that
                           C w = Cw ,
                                          X
                                    1/2
                           Cw = ǫw qw           ǫy qy−1 Py,w Ty ,
                                          y≤w

where Py,w ∈ A is a polynomial in q of degree ≤ 21 (l(w) − l(y) − 1) for y < w, and
Pw,w = 1.
      Elements Cw form a basis (called C-basis) of H as an A-module. This basis
and the polynomials Py,w (called Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials) turn out to be
of fundamental interest in the representation theory of Coxeter groups and Hecke
algebras.
2.3. Given y, w ∈ W , we write y ≺ w if y < w and Py,w is a polynomial in q of
degree exactly 21 (l(w) − l(y) − 1) (which is, of course, possible only if l(w) − l(y)
is odd). In this case the coeﬃcient of the highest power of q in Py,w is denoted by
µ(y, w). If w ≺ y we set µ(w, y) = µ(y, w), otherwise (if neither y ≺ w nor w ≺ y)
let µ(y, w) = µ(w, y) = 0. We write y − w if µ(x, y) 6= 0.
      For any w ∈ W deﬁne subsets of S:
              L(w) = {s ∈ S | sw < w},      R(w) = {s ∈ S | ws < w}.
       Now deﬁne y ≤L w to mean that there is a chain y = y0 , y1 , . . . , yn = w such
that yi − yi+1 and L(yi ) 6⊂ L(yi+1 ) for 0 ≤ i < n. Similarly, say that y ≤R w
if y −1 ≤L w−1 . Finally, deﬁne y ≤LR w to mean that there exists a chain y =
y0 , y1 , . . . , yn = w such that for each i < n either yi ≤L yi+1 or yi ≤R yi+1 .
       Let ∼L , ∼R , ∼LR be the equivalence relations associated to the preorders
≤L , ≤R , ≤LR , respectively. The corresponding equivalence classes are called left,
right and two-sided cells of W .
2.4. We shall often make use of the following properties of the deﬁned relations.
Lemma. Let x, y ∈ W and x < y.
    (i) If there exists s ∈ S such that x < sx, sy < y, then x ≺ y if and only if
        y = sx.
   (ii) If there exists s ∈ S such that x < xs, ys < y, then x ≺ y if and only if
        y = xs.
        Moreover, in each of the cases µ(x, y) = 1.
(This statement can be found in the proof of Theorem 1.3 in [KL]; it follows from
the formula for the action of the elements Ts on the basis {Cw | w ∈ W } of H and
the deﬁnition of Cw .)
Corollary.
     (i) If x ≤L y, then R(x) ⊃ R(y). Hence, x ∼L y implies R(x) = R(y).
    (ii) If x ≤R y, then L(x) ⊃ L(y). Hence, x ∼R y implies L(x) = L(y).
(To prove the corollary it is enough to consider the case x − y with L(x) 6⊂ L(y),
details can be found in [KL].)

2.5. The main purpose of the partition of a Coxeter group W into cells is that
it gives rise to the representations of group W and its Hecke algebra H. It is
convenient to describe these representations using W -graphs.
      Let X be a set. Consider an oriented graph Γ whose set of vertices is X; for
each x ∈ X there is assigned a subset Ix of S, and if Ix 6⊂ Iy , then there is an edge
(x, y) ∈ X × X labeled by an integer µ(x, y). Graph Γ is called a W -graph if the
map s → τs , such that
                    
                    
                     −x, if x ∈ X, s ∈ Ix ,
                    
             τs x =               X
                    
                     qx + q 1/2         µ(x, y)y, if x ∈ X, s 6∈ Ix ,
                    
                                  y∈X, s∈Iy

deﬁnes a representation of H on the free A-module A(X).
      In [KL] it was shown that X = W with Ix = L(x) and µ(x, y) deﬁned
by the polynomial Px,y as in 2.3 gives a W -graph. Moreover, its full subgraphs
corresponding to the left cells with the same sets Ix and the same function µ are
W -graphs themselves. Finally, when W is a symmetric group Sn it was proved that
all the irreducible representations of H are deﬁned by the W -graphs associated to
the left cells of W .

                       3. Right-angled Coxeter groups
3.1. Recall that Coxeter group (W, S) is called a right-angled Coxeter group if for
any s 6= t in S the product st has order 2 or ∞. The Coxeter graph of W has only
edges labeled via ∞ (see examples in Figure 1).
     The simplest example of a right-angled Coxeter group is the inﬁnite dihedral
group D∞ = < s1 , s2 | s21 = s22 = 1 >. We are mainly interested in right-angled
Coxeter groups generated by reﬂections in the hyperbolic n-space. The important
example for us are the groups Pn having representations
           Pn = < s1 , s2 , . . . , sn | s2i = 1, (sj sj+1 )2 = 1, (sn s1 )2 = 1 >
where i = 1, . . . , n; j = 1, . . . n − 1. If n ≥ 5 the group Pn can be presented as
a group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane generated by reﬂections about the
sides of a right-angled hyperbolic n-gon (for more information about this and other
geometric facts mentioned here we refer the reader to [VS]).

3.2. If a Coxeter group (W, S) is presented by isometries of the hyperbolic space,
then it gives rise to a tessellation of the space by the fundamental chambers of
the group. The dual graph G of this tessellation endowed with the standard graph
metric reﬂects the structure of the initial group: ﬁxing a vertex e ∈ G which
will correspond to the identity element of W and labelling all the edges with the
corresponding simple reﬂections from S, we can associate to an element w ∈ W
represented by a word on S a geodesic path starting from e in G. Two paths deﬁne
the same element if and only if they have the same ends. Reduced expressions in
W correspond to the shortest geodesics in G. The graph G is called a Cayley graph

        Figure 1. Coxeter graphs of the groups generated by reﬂections

        hyperbolic 3-space.


of (W, S); this graph can be deﬁned for an arbitrary group with a ﬁxed system of
generators.

3.3. Let (W, S) be an arbitrary Coxeter group. We call by lines elements w ∈ W
that have unique reduced expressions. By a subword of a word s1 s2 . . . sn , si ∈ S
we mean any expression of the form si si+1 . . . sj , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n. The subword u
of word w0 uw1 is called a segment of the word and of the corresponding element
w ∈ W if u represents a maximal line such that any reduced expression of w has
the form w0′ uw1′ with w0 = w0′ , w1 = w1′ as the elements of the group W (here
“maximal” means that u is not contained in any other subword with the same
properties).
     Lines are exactly the unique shortest geodesics of a Cayley graph that start
from e. The same way, segments of w ∈ W correspond to the (maximal) geodesics
of a Cayley graph that are contained in any shortest geodesic corresponding to w.
The only segment of a line is the line itself.
     Let us give a characterization of the lines and segments in a right-angled
Coxeter group.

Proposition. Let (W, S) be a right-angled Coxeter group. Then
    (i) a word s1 . . . sk represents a line in W if and only if for any i = 1, . . . , k−1
        the product si si+1 has order ∞;
6                                  MIKHAIL BELOLIPETSKY


    (ii) a subword u of w0 uw1 is a segment if and only if u gives a minimal line
         such that #R(w0 ) 6= 1 and #L(w1 ) 6= 1 (here “minimal” means that u
         does not contain any proper or empty subword with the same property).

      The proof easily follows from the deﬁnitions.
      The proposition implies that any element w in a right-angled Coxeter group
can be written as w = u0 s1,1 . . . s1,n1 u1 s2,1 . . . s2,n2 u2 . . . sk,1 . . . sk,nk uk where all
the subwords ui are either trivial or segments in w, ni ≥ 2 and si,j si,j+1 = si,j+1 si,j
for i = 1, . . . , k, j = 1, . . . , ni − 1.

                            4. Distinguished Involutions
     We recall some deﬁnitions and results from [L2], [L3].
     As in Section 2 we ﬁx a Coxeter group (W, S) and denote by H the cor-
responding Hecke algebra over A = Z[q 1/2 , q −1/2 ]. For any x, y, z ∈ W deﬁne
elements fx,y,z , gx,y,z , hx,y,z in A so that

                                                 X
                                     Tex Tey =       fx,y,z Tez ,
                                                 z
                                                 X
                                     Tex Cy =        gx,y,z Cz ,
                                                 z
                                                 X
                                     Cx Cy =         hx,y,z Cz .
                                                 z


4.1. Let A+ = Z[q 1/2 ]. To go further we need the following assumptions about
the Coxeter group:
      – (W, S) is crystallographic, which means that for any s 6= t in S the product
        st has order 2, 3, 4, 6 or ∞;
      – (W, S) is bounded, which means that there exists an integer N ≥ 0 such
        that q N/2 fx,y,z ∈ A+ for all x, y, z ∈ W , or equivalently, q N/2 hx,y,z ∈ A+
        for all x, y, z ∈ W .

4.2. Right-angled Coxeter groups are crystallographic. We prove that they are
bounded:
Lemma. If in right-angled Coxeter group (W, S) ts1 . . . sn = t̂s1 . . . ŝj . . . sn (t, si ∈
S, i = 1, . . . , n), then t = sj and t commutes with s1 , . . . , sj−1 .

Proof. By [T] there is a sequence of elementary M-operations taking word ts1 . . . sn
to t̂s1 . . . ŝj . . . sn (t, si ∈ S). In case of right-angled groups the operations are
     (i) ss → 1;
    (ii) st → ts

(s, t ∈ S). Both operations preserve parity of the number of a simple reﬂection
occurrences in the word, which follows t = sj . We shall prove that t commutes
with s1 , . . . , sj−1 by induction on j. If j − 1 = 1, then we have ts1 t = s1 ; ts1 = s1 t.
Now, if ts1 . . . sn is equivalent to t̂s1 . . . sj−1 t̂sj+1 . . . sn and j > 2, then there
is an M-operation which decreases the number of simple reﬂections between two
t’s. It can be only an operation of type (ii), so t commutes with some si with
i ∈ {1, . . . , j − 1}. It follows by the induction hypothesis that t also commutes
with the remaining si .                                                                   

Theorem. Let (W, S) be a right-angled Coxeter group. Then it is bounded with
                ′
N = max l(w0S ), where S ′ runs through all subsets of S such that corresponding
             ′                        ′                                  ′
subgroup (W S , S ′ ) is ﬁnite and w0S denotes the longest element of W S .

Proof. Take arbitrary x, y ∈ W and let sk . . . s1 , t1 . . . tn be corresponding reduced
expressions (si , tj ∈ S, i = 1, . . . , k, j = 1, . . . , n). We have

If l(s1 y) = 1 + l(y), then Tes1 Tey = Tes1 y ; otherwise, l(s1 y) = l(y) − 1 and Tes1 Tey =
(q 1/2 − q −1/2 )Tey + Tes1 y .
       Proceeding inductively we obtain (similarly to [L2]):
                                          X
                                Tex Tey =   (q 1/2 − q −1/2 )pI TeI
                                                I
where I ranges over all subsets i1 < · · · < ipI of {1, . . . , k} such that
                  sil . . . ŝil−1 . . . ŝi1 . . . s1 y < ŝil . . . ŝil−1 . . . ŝi1 . . . s1 y
for l = 1, . . . , pI , and TeI = sk . . . ŝip . . . ŝi1 . . . s1 y, p = pI = #I.
      From the lemma it follows that for any such I there exists a reduced ex-
pression of x in which ij = j and sij ∈ L(y) for j = 1, . . . , l. Denoting by Γy
the subgroup of W generated by simple reﬂections from L(y), we have sip . . . si1
is a reduced expression of an element from Γy . To complete the proof it re-
mains to show that for any y ∈ W subgroup Γy ≤ W is ﬁnite. Really, let
s 6= t ∈ L(y). This means that y has a reduced expression su2 . . . un (s, uj ∈ S)
and tsu2 . . . un = t̂su2 . . . ûi . . . un , so again by the lemma st = ts, which follows
Γy ∼    p

4.3. Let a(z) be the smallest integer such that q a(z)/2 hx,y,z ∈ A+ for any x, y ∈
W . It follows that 0 ≤ a(z) ≤ N for any z ∈ W . Here are some important
properties of the function a obtained in [L2], [L3]:
Properties of a(z):
    (i) a(w) = a(w−1 ) for all w ∈ W ;
   (ii) a(w) = 0 if and only if w = e;
  (iii) the function a is constant on the two-sided cells of W ;
  (iv) a(w) ≤ l(w) for all w ∈ W .

4.4. Deﬁne a subset D ⊂ W as follows:
                         D = {z ∈ W | a(z) = l(z) − 2δ(z)},
where δ(z) is the degree of Pe,z as a polynomial in q.
      It can be shown that d2 = e for any d ∈ D. The elements of D are called
distinguished involutions of W . The following theorem was proved in [L3]:
Theorem. Any left cell contains a unique d ∈ D.
     We shall use this powerful result to distinguish left cells of the groups Pn in
the next section.

                                       5. Cells
      We mainly consider left cells and corresponding left H-modules. The results
concerning right cells are entirely similar. Two-sided cells and H-bimodules are
obtained via combination of the left and right-sided ones.
      Let us ﬁrst suppose that (W, S) is an arbitrary Coxeter group. We shall
always use s, t (possibly with subscribed indexes which will be not connected with
the initial ordering of generators in the case of the group Pn ) to denote the elements
from S.
5.1. Let w1 , w2 ∈ W . We say that w1 and w2 belong to the same left precell and
write w1 ∼lp w2 if there exists wL 6= 1 such that w1 , w2 have reduced expressions
w1′ wL , w2′ wL , respectively, and
     (a) if l(wL ) > 1, then w1′ , w2′ are either trivial or segments in w1 , w2 , resp.;
     (b) if l(wL ) = 1, then w1 and w2 are lines (with R(w1 ) = R(w2 ) = wL ).
Let us also suppose 1 ∼lp 1.
Proposition. Relation ∼lp has the following properties:
   (i) it is an equivalence relation on W ;
  (ii) each left precell Γ contains a unique shortest element wL = wL (Γ) such
       that Γ = {w | w = w′ wL } where w′ is either trivial, or a segment in w, or
       w′ wL is a line (as in the deﬁnition of ∼lp ).

Proof. To prove (i) we need only to check the transitivity of ∼lp . Suppose
                                w1 ∼lp w2 , w2 ∼lp w3 .
Then we have
                w1 = w1′ wL1 , w2 = w2′ wL1 = w2′′ wL2 , w3 = w3′ wL2 ,
with w1′ , w2′ , w2′′ , w3′ as in the deﬁnition of ∼lp . We want to show w1 ∼L w3 and
we can suppose that w1 , w2 , w3 are all unequal since otherwise it is trivial. We
now need to do some routine case by case considerations:
1) l(wL1 ) = 1. Then w2 is a line, so w2′′ cannot be its proper segment; consequently
we have only two possibilities:
     a) l(wL2 ) = 1; wL2 = wL1 ; w3 ∼L w1 .
        CELLS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF RIGHT-ANGLED COXETER GROUPS                       9


     b) w2′′ = 1; w3 = w3′ wL2 = w3′ w2 , w3′ 6= 1 is a segment in w3 but this is
        impossible by the deﬁnition of segment since w2 is a line.
2) The case l(wL2 ) = 1 is entirely similar.
3) l(wL1 ) > 1, l(wL2 ) > 1. There are again two possibilities:
     a) w2′ = 1; w1 = w1′ wL1 = w1′ w2 = w1′ w2′′ wL2 , w1′ 6= 1 is a segment in w1 . We
        have either w2′′ = 1, which follows w3 ∼L w1 , or w2′′ is a segment in w2′′ wL2
        which leads to a contradiction with the deﬁnition of segment.
     b) w2′ is a segment in w2 then either w2′ = w2′′ and w3 ∼L w1 or w2′′ = 1;
        w3 = w3′ wL2 = w3′ w2 = w3′ w2′ wL1 , which is impossible by the deﬁnition of
        segment.
So in all the possible cases we obtain w1 ∼L w3 .
     To prove (ii) we can take for wL (any) shortest element of the equivalence class
Γ. Then any w in Γ will have the required form by the deﬁnition and uniqueness of
wL follows. It is also possible to deduce the existence and uniqueness of wL from
the proof of (i).                                                                  

     The existence of the canonical representatives wL of the left precells implies
that the following deﬁnitions make sense:
     Dimension of a non-unit left precell Γ dim(Γ) = #L(wL ), since l(wL ) ≥ 1 we
have dim(Γ) ≥ 1. Given two left precells Γ1 , Γ2 we say that Γ1 ≤L Γ2 , Γ1 ≺ Γ2 ,
Γ1 − Γ2 and Γ1 ∼L Γ2 if wL (Γ1 ) ≤L wL (Γ2 ), wL (Γ1 ) ≺ wL (Γ2 ), wL (Γ1 ) − wL (Γ2 )
and wL (Γ1 ) ∼L wL (Γ2 ), respectively. We also deﬁne L(Γ) = L(wL (Γ)) and R(Γ) =
R(wL (Γ)).

5.2. Lemma. A left cell in W is a union of the left precells which are ∼L -
equivalent to each other.

Proof. By Lemma 2.4 if w1 ∼lp w2 , then w1 ∼L w2 . The corresponding chains
x0 −x1 −· · ·−xk , joining w1 (w2 ) with wL and having property L(xi )∩ L(xi+1 ) = ∅
for any i (which is actually stronger than it is required for ∼L ), are obtained from
the lines w1′ (w2′ ) deﬁned in Proposition 5.1 by the rule x0 = w1′ wL = t1 . . . tk wL ,
xi = ti+1 . . . tk wL . Since both ∼L and ∼lp are equivalence relations the remaining
part of the statement follows easily.                                                 

     The language of precells seems to be very appropriate for the description
of the cells of right-angled Coxeter groups. We shall consider in detail the case
W = Pn . Similar methods can be applied to the other right-angled Coxeter groups
as well, we are going to study these cases elsewhere.

5.3. Theorem. The non-unit left cells of the group Pn (n ≥ 5) are:
    (i) n cells corresponding to the 1-dimensional left precells of Pn deﬁned by the
        generators of Pn ;
10                                      MIKHAIL BELOLIPETSKY


     (ii) inﬁnitely many cells which are equivalence classes of the left precells with
                                                                       ′
          the canonical representatives Γ(wL ), such that wL = t1 t2 wL   with t1 t2 =
                                   ′
          t2 t1 (t1 , t2 ∈ S) and wL is a segment in wL .


Proof. 1) We ﬁrst show that each left precell of Pn belongs to an at least one left
cell deﬁned in the statement. If dim(Γ) = 1, then l(wL (Γ)) = 1 (as it easily follows
from the deﬁnitions of the precell and wL ), so Γ is one of the 1-dimensional precells
from (i). By the deﬁnition of the group Pn the dimensions of its left precells are
not greater than 2 (this also follows from the representation of Pn as a group of
isometries of the hyperbolic plane); thus it remains to consider a left precell Γ with
dim(Γ) = 2.
      Let wL = wL (Γ), we have wL = t1,1 . . . t1,n1 u1 t2,1 . . . t2,n2 u2 . . . tk,1 . . . tk,nk uk
where for any admissible i, j the subwords ui are either trivial or segments in wL ,
ni ≥ 2 and ti,j ti,j+1 = ti,j+1 ti,j . Deﬁne two elementary moves between reduced
words:
     A: t1 t2 t3 x → t2 t3 x for t1 t2 = t2 t1 , t2 t3 = t3 t2 and arbitrary subword x;
     B: s1 s2 ut1 t2 x → t1 t2 x for t1 t2 = t2 t1 , s1 s2 = s2 s1 , u is a segment or u = 1
        and arbitrary x.
By applying this elementary moves to wL one can obtain the word tk,nk −1 tk,nk uk
(uk is a segment) which deﬁnes a canonical precell in (ii). We shall show that the
moves produce ∼L -equivalent words.
      The equivalence w = t1 t2 t3 x ∼L w0 = t2 t3 x is easy: we have w = t1 w0 ,
L(w0 ) = {t1 , t2 }, L(w) = {t2 , t3 } and t3 6= t1 (because all the expressions are
reduced), so w ≻ w0 , L(w0 ) 6⊂ L(w) and L(w) 6⊂ L(w0 ).
      To prove that move B is a left equivalence we shall use a supplementary
construction. Having w = s1 s2 ut1 t2 x, w0 = t1 t2 x, deﬁne w∗ = t1 u−1 s1 s2 ut1 t2 x.
Note that u is a segment in w implies u−1 and u are segments in w∗ . We are going
to show the following relations:

                             ≤L                   ∼L         ∼L         ∼L         ∼L
              w0                             w∗        w1∗        ...        wl∗        w
                                            
                                            
                                            
                   ≥L        ≥L         ≥L
              w1        w2        ...        wn

where wi+1 is obtained from wi by adding at the left the next letter of w∗ and
  ∗
wj+1  is obtained from wj∗ by deleting a letter at the left.
     The diﬃcult part is to prove w0 ≤L w∗ since all the other chains are just of
the form x − y with |l(x) − l(y)| = 1 and so satisfy the deﬁnitions (one can also
note that w∗ ∼lp w).
     Let u = u1 . . . uk with ui ∈ S is a (the) reduced expression of u. It is enough
                                                    ∗
to show that the coeﬃcient µ(w0 , w∗ ) of the q (l(w )−l(w0 )−1)/2 = q k+1 in Pw0 ,w∗ is
not 0. Let us make use of the following formula for the polynomials Py,w obtained
        CELLS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF RIGHT-ANGLED COXETER GROUPS                                     11


in the proof of existence of the Cw -basis in [KL]:
                                     X
     Py,w = q 1−c Psy,v + q c Py,v −      µ(z, v)qz−1/2 qv1/2 q 1/2 Py,z                  (y ≤ w),
                                          y≤z≺v
                                           sz<z

where w = sv with l(w) = 1 + l(v), c = 1 if sy < y, c = 0 if sy > y and Px,v = 0
unless x ≤ v.
     We have
                 Pw0 ,w∗ = Pt1 t2 x,t1 u−1 s1 s2 ut1 t2 x = Pt2 x,v + qPt1 t2 x,v − Σ0
                                             P              −1/2 1/2 1/2
with v = u−1 s1 s2 ut1 t2 x and Σ0 =              µ(z, v)qz      qv q Py,z where the summa-
tion is over z such that t1 t2 x ≤ z ≺ v, t1 z < z.
      µ(t2 x, v) = 0 because L(v) = uk 6∈ L(t2 x) since u is a segment in w, and
so by Lemma 2.4 Pt2 x,v has the maximal possible degree (= k + 1) if and only if
u−1 s1 s2 ut1 t2 x = uk t2 x, which is impossible. Consider the second term:
              qPt1 t2 x,v = q 2 Puk t1 t2 x,uk−1 ...u1 s1 s2 u1 ...uk t1 t2 x + qP1 − qΣ1 ,
deﬁning for i = 1, . . . , k :
                        Pi = Pyi ,vi ,
                                 X
                        Σi =                  µ(z, v)qz−1/2 qv1/2
                                                               i
                                                                  q 1/2 Pyi ,z ,
                                  yi ≤z≺vi
                                 uk−i+1 z<z
                         yi = uk−i+2 . . . uk t1 t2 x,
                         vi = uk−i . . . u1 s1 s2 u1 . . . uk t1 t2 x
(with the conventions that uk−i+2 . . . uk = 1 for i = 1 and uk−i . . . u1 = 1 for
i = k).
      The remarkable point is that the coeﬃcients of q k−i+2 in qPi and Σi−1 for
i = 1, . . . , k are equal! Really, consider the sum Σi . We have L(vi ) = uk−i 6∈ L(z)
(since uk−i+1 ∈ L(z) and it does not commute with uk−i ) so by Lemma 2.4, z ≺ vi
implies vi = uk−i z, µ(z, vi ) = 1, z = uk−i−1 . . . u1 s1 s2 u1 . . . uk t1 t2 x = vi+1 and
this is possible only if
                                 uk−i−1 = uk−i+1 .    (∗)
In this case we have Pyi ,z = Pyi ,vi+1 = Pyi+1 ,vi+1 (the last equality is the conse-
quence of L(yi ) = uk−i+2 6= uk−i+1 = L(vi+1 )) and so Σi = qPi+1 . It remains to
check that if µ(yi+1 , vi+1 ) 6= 0, then the equality (∗) holds, which can be easily
done by supposing on the contrary that uk−i−1 6= uk−i+1 and applying Lemma
2.4. The case of Σ0 should be considered separately, of course, but appears to be
very similar.
      So the leading terms of qPi and Σi−1 repetitively cancel each other and we
ﬁnally obtain that the coeﬃcient of q k+1 in Pw0 ,w∗ is equal to the leading coeﬃcient
of q k+1 Pu1 yk ,vk , which is equal to 1 because u1 yk < vk and l(vk ) − l(u1 yk ) = 2.
      This proves w0 ≺ w∗ with µ(w0 , w∗ ) = 1.

      2) It remains to show that the cells deﬁned in the statement do not intersect.
We shall use the distinguished involutions.
      For the non-unit elements z ∈ Pn we have a(z) ∈ {1, 2}. If z is in a cell of
type (i), then there exists s ∼L z and by the Properties 4.3 a(z) = a(s) = 1. Now
let z is in a cell of type (ii). Using Moves A, B from the ﬁrst part of this proof
and their right-side analogs we see that z belongs to the same two-sided cell as st
(s, t ∈ S, (st)2 = 1). It is easy to show that a(st) = 2 (take x = y = st in the
deﬁnition of the function a), so again by 4.3 a(z) = 2.
      It immediately follows from the deﬁnitions that si ∈ D, i = 1, . . . , n, so we
have the distinguished involutions for each of the cells of type (i). Now consider a
cell of type (ii) with the represenative Γ(wL ) as in the statement of the theorem.
                     ′ −1        ′
An element z = wL         t1 t2 wL ∈ Γ(wL ) is an involution, we shall see that z ∈ D.
            ′
Suppose wL = u1 . . . uk , ui ∈ S. We have
                  Pe,z = Pe,uk ...u1 t1 t2 u1 ...uk = Puk ,uk ...u1 t1 t2 u1 ...uk .
We see that the argument which was used to show that w0 ≤L w∗ in part (1) of
the proof works without any changes in this case either and gives deg(Pe,z ) = k.
So
                     l(z) − 2δ(z) = 2k + 2 − 2k = 2 = a(z)
and z ∈ D by the deﬁnition.
     It remains to apply Theorem 4.4 to distinguish all the left cells.                


5.4. It was pointed out to me by V. Ostrik that the cells of type (i) were previ-
ously considered in [L1]. There the cells and corresponding representations were
constructed for an arbitrary Coxeter group and then thoroughly studied in the
ﬁnite and aﬃne cases.
      Left cells of the group Pn can be visualized on the corresponding tessellation
of the hyperbolic plane. Figure 2 presents the cells for the group P5 : the pentagon
in the center is the unit cell, ﬁve shaded regions represent the cells of type (i) all
giving a one two-sided cell (see Corollary 5.7), each white region represents a cell
of type (ii) and altogether they form the third two-sided cell.
     Below we give several corollaries from Theorem 5.3 and its proof.

5.5. Corollary. The distinguished involutions of the group Pn are
     D = {1} ∪ {s1 , . . . , sn } ∪ {ustu−1 | (st)2 = 1, u is a segment in ustu−1 }.


     The distinguished involutions are related with algebra J deﬁned in [L3] which
may be regarded as an asymptotic version of Hecke algebra H. Using the methods
from [L3] this corollary can be applied to retrieve a partial structure information
about algebra J of the group Pn .

                         Figure 2. Cells of the group P5 .1



5.6. Corollary. W -graphs associated to the left cells of type (i) are inﬁnite
rooted trees (binary trees for the group P5 , see Figure 3), while the W -graphs
associated to the type (ii) cells admit inﬁnitely many diﬀerent cycles.
      One can see that all the W -graphs corresponding to the cells of type (i) of
the group Pn deﬁne equivalent representations of H, with the equivalences induced
by the cyclic permutations of the simple reﬂections si ∈ S. We suppose that the
representations corresponding to the cells of type (ii) are also all equivalent, but
this does not readily follow from the above arguments.

5.7. Corollary. The partition of the group Pn (n ≥ 5) onto two-sided cells
consits of 3 elements:
      - the unit cell corresponding to the trivial representation of H;
      - the union of the left cells of type (i) (a 1-dimensional cell), the correspond-
        ing W -graph is an inﬁnite tree;

         type (i) of the group P5 (all µ(x, y) = 1, the vertices are repre-

       - the union of the left cells of type (ii) (a 2-dimensional cell), the corre-
         sponding W -graph admits inﬁnitely many diﬀerent cycles.

     The remarkable point about this corollary is that to establish it we actually
need only the Moves A, B from the proof 5.3 with their right-side analogs, and so
we do not use part (2) of the argument which relies on certain very strong results
about distinguished involutions.
