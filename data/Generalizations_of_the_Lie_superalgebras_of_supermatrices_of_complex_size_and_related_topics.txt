                                                     Abstract. We distinguish a class of simple filtered Lie algebras LUg (λ) of polynomial
                                                     growth with increasing filtration and whose associated graded Lie algebras are not simple.
                                                     We describe presentations of such algebras. The Lie algebras LUg (λ), where λ runs over the
                                                     projective space of dimension equal to the rank of g, are quantizations of the Lie algebras
                                                     of functions on the orbits of the coadjoint representation of g.
                                                        The Lie algebra gl(λ) of matrices of complex size is the simplest example; it is LUsl(2) (λ).
                                                     The dynamical systems associated with it in the space of pseudodifferential operators in the
                                                     same way as the KdV hierarchy is associated with sl(n) are those studied by Gelfand–Dickey
                                                     and Khesin–Malikov. For g 6= sl(2) we get generalizations of gl(λ) and the corresponding
                                                     dynamical systems, in particular, their superized versions. The algebras LUsl(2) (λ) posess
                                                     a trace and an invariant symmetric bilinear form, hence, with these Lie algebras associated
                                                     are analogs of the Yang-Baxter equation, KdV, etc.
                                                        Our presentation of LUs (λ) for a simple s is related to presentation of s in terms of a
                                                     certain pair of generators. For s = sl(n) there are just 9 such relations.

                                             replaced pgl(λ) with sl(λ): to write pgl(λ) is correct, but notation sl(λ) is closer to its finite

                                             0.0. History. About 1966, V. Kac and B. Weisfeiler began the study of simple filtered
                                             Lie algebras of polynomial growth. Kac first considered the Z-graded Lie algebras associated
                                             with the filtered ones and classified simple graded Lie algebras of polynomial growth under a
                                             technical assumption and conjectured the inessential nature of the assumption. It took more
                                             than 20 years to get rid of the assumption: see very complicated papers by O. Mathieu,
                                             cf. [K] and references therein. For a similar list of simple Z-graded Lie superalgebras of
                                             polynomial growth see [KS], [LSc].
                                                The Lie algebras Kac distinguished (or rather the algebras of derivations of their nontrivial
                                             central extensions, the Kac–Moody algebras) proved very interesting in applications. These
                                             algebras aroused such interest that the study of filtered algebras was arrested for two decades.

Little by little, however, the simplest representative of the new class of simple filtered Lie
superalgebras (of polynomial growth), namely, the Lie algebra gl(λ) of matrices of complex
size, and its projectivization, i.e., the quotient modulo the constants, pgl(λ), drew its share
of attention [F], [KM], [KR].
   While we typed this paper, Shoikhet [Sh] published a description of representations of
gl(λ); we are thankful to M. Vasiliev who informed us of still other applications of general-
izations of gl(λ), see [BWV], [KV].
   This paper begins a systematic study of a new class of Lie algebras: simple filtered Lie
algebras of polynomial growth (SFLAPG) for which the graded Lie algebras associated with
the filtration considered are not simple; sl(λ) is our first example. Actually, an example
of a Lie algebra of class SFLAPG was known even before the notion of Lie algebras was
introduced. Indeed, the only deformation (physicists call it quantization) Q of the Poisson
Lie algebra po(2n) sends po(2n) into diff(n), the Lie algebra of differential operators with
polynomial coefficients; the restriction of Q to h(2n) = po(2n)/center, the Lie algebra of
Hamiltonian vector fields, sends h(2n) to the projectivization pdiff(n) = diff(n)/C · 1 of
diff(n). The Lie algebra pdiff(n) escaped Kac’s classification, though it is the deform of an
algebra from his list, because its intrinsically natural filtration given by deg qi = − deg ∂qi = 1
is not of polynomial growth while the graded Lie algebra associated with the filtration of
polynomial growth (given by deg qi = deg ∂qi = 1) is not simple.
   Observe that from the point of view of dynamical systems the Lie algebra diff(n) is not
very interesting: it does not possesses a nondegenerate bilinear symmetric form; we will
consider its subalgebras that do.
   In what follows we will usually denote the associative (super)algebras by Latin letters;
the Lie (super)algebras associated with them by Gothic letters; e.g., gl(n) = L(Mat(n)),
diff(n) = L(Diff(n)), where the functor L replaces the dot product withthe bracket.

0.1. The construction. Problems related. Each of our Lie algebras (and Lie superal-
gebras) LUg(λ) is realized as a quotient of the Lie algebra of global sections of the sheaf of
twisted D-modules on the flag variety, cf. [Ka], [Di]. The general construction consists of
the preparatory step 0), the main steps 1) and 2) and two extra steps 3) and 4).
  We distinguish two cases: A) dim g < ∞ and g possesses a Cartan matrix and B) g is a
simple vectorial Lie (super)algebra.
  Let g = g− ⊕ h ⊕ g+ , where g+ = ⊕ gα and g− = ⊕ gα , be one of the simple Z-graded
                                       α>0                α<0
Lie algebras of polynomial growth, either finite dimensional or of vector fields, represented
as the sum of its maximal torus (usually identical with the Cartan subalgebra) h and the
root subspaces gα corresponding to an order in the set R of roots.
   Observe that each order of R is in one-to-one correspondence with a system of simple
roots. For the finite dimensional Lie algebras g all systems of simple roots are equivalent, the
equivalence is established by the Weyl group. For Lie superalgebras and infinite dimensional
Lie algebras of vector fields there are inequivalent systems of simple roots; nevertheless, there
is an analog of the Weyl group and the passage from system to system is described in [PS].
   For vectorial Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras, even the dimension of the superspaces
X = (g− )∗ associated with systems of simple roots can vary. It is not clear if only essential
(see [PS]) systems of simple roots are essential in the construction of Verma modules (roughly
speaking, each Verma module is isomorphic to the space of functions on X) in which we will
realize LUg(λ), but hopefully not all.
   Step 0): From g to g̃. From representation theory it is clear that there exists a realization
of the elements of g by differential operators of degree ≤ 1 on the space X = (g− )∗ . The

realization has rank g parameters (coordinates λ = (λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ h∗ of the highest weight
of the g-module M λ ). For the algorithms of construction and its execution in some cases see
[BMP], [B], [BGLS].
                                                                         .
   Let g̃ be the image of g with respect to this realization. Let S̃ (g̃) be the associative
                                       .
subalgebra generated by g̃. Clearly, S̃ (g̃) ⊂ diff(g− ). Set
                              .
                   Ug(λ) = S̃ (g̃)/J(λ), where J(λ) is the maxiam ideal.
Observe that J(λ) = 0 for generic λ.
   Roughly speaking, Ug(λ) is “Mat”(Lλ ), where Lλ is the quotient of M λ modulo the max-
imal submodule I(λ) (it can be determined and described with the help of the Shapovalov
                       .
form, see [K]) and S̃ (g̃) is the subalgebra generated by g̃ in the symmetric algebra of g̃
                                                                .                      .
modulo the relations between differential operators. Clearly, S̃ (g̃) is smaller than S (g) due
to the relations between the differential operators that span g̃.
   To explicitly describe the generators of J(λ) is a main technical problem. We solve it in
this paper for rkg = 1. The general case will be considered elsewhere.
   Step 1) From Ug(λ) to LUg(λ) Recall that LUg(λ) is the Lie algebra whose space is the
same as that of Ug(λ) and the bracket is the commutator.
   Step 2) Montgomery’s functor S. Montgomery suggested [M] a construction of simple Lie
superalgebras:
             Mo: a central simple Z-graded algebra 7→ a simple Lie superalgebra.                         (Mo)
Observe that the associative algebras Ug(λ) constructed from simple Lie algebras g are central
simple. In [LM] we intend to consider Montgomery superalgebras Mo(Ug(λ)) and compare
them with the Lie superalgebras LUs(λ) constructed from Lie superalgebras s. Montgomery
functor often produces new Lie superalgebras, e.g., if g is equal to f4 or ei , though not always:
Mo(Usl(2) (λ)) ∼
               = LUosp(1|2) (λ).
   Step 3) Twisted versions An outer automorphism a of G = LUg(λ) or Mo(Ug(λ)) might
single out a new simple Lie subsuperalgebra a0 (G), the set of fixed points of G under a.
   For example, the intersection of LUsl(2) (λ) with the set of skew-adjoint differential oper-
ators is a new Lie algebra o/sp(λ) while the intersection of Mo(Usl(2) (λ)) = LUosp(1|2) (λ)
with the set of superskew-adjoint operators is the Lie superalgebra osp(λ + 1|λ). For the
description of the outer automorphisms of gl(λ) see [LAS]. In general even the definition is
unclear.
   Step 4) Deformations The deformations of Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras obtained
via steps 1) – 3) may lead to new algebras of class SFLAPG, cf. [Go]. A. Sergeev posed the
following interesting problem:
   what Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras can we get by applying the above constructions
1) – 3) to the quantum deformation Uq (g) of U(g)?
Remark . The above procedure can be also applied to (twisted) loop algebras g = h(k) and the stringy
algebras; the result will be realized with differential operators of infinitely many indeterminates; they remind
vertex operators. The algebra LUh(k) (λ) is a polynomial one but not of polynomial growth.

0.2. Another description of Ug(λ). For the finite dimensional simple g there is an
alternative description of Ug(λ) as the quotient of U(g) modulo the central character, i.e.,
modulo the ideal C(λ) generated by rank g elements Ci − ki (λ), where the Ci is the i-th
Casimir element and the ki (λ) is the (computed by Harish-Chandra and Berezin) value of
Ci on M λ . This description of Ug(λ) goes back, perhaps, to Kostant, cf. [Ka]. From this
description it is clear that, after the shift by ρ, the half sum of positive roots, we get
                           LUg(σ(λ)) ∼ = LUg(λ) for any σ ∈ W (g).
4                             PAVEL GROZMAN, DIMITRY LEITES

A similar isomorphism holds for Mo(Ug(λ)). In particular, over R, it suffices to consider the
λ that belong to one Weyl chamber only.
   For vectorial Lie algebras the description of Ug(λ) as U(g)/C(λ) is inapplicable. For ex-
ample, let g = vect(n). The highest weight Verma modules are (for the standard filtration
of g) identical with Verma modules over sl(n + 1), but the center of U(vect(n)) consists of
constants only. It is a research problem to describe the generators of C(λ) in such cases.
   Though the center of U(g) is completely described by A. Sergeev for all simple finite
dimensional Lie superalgebras [S], the problem
   describe the generators of the ideal C(λ)
   is open for Lie superalgebras g even if g is of the form g(A) (i.e., if g has Cartan matrix
A) different from osp(1|2n): for them the center of U(g) is not noetherian and it is a priori
unclear if C(λ) has infinitely or finitely many generators. (As we will show elsewhere, C(λ)
is generated for Lie superalgebras g of the form g(A) by the first rkg Casimir operators and
finitely many extra elements. For algebras g of other types we do not even have a conjecture.)

0.3. Our result. The main result is the statement of the fact that the above constructions
1) – 4) yield a new class of simple Lie (super) algebras of polynomial growth (some of which
have nice properties).
   Observe that our Lie algebras LUg(λ) are quantizations of the Lie algebras considered
in [DGS] which are also of class SFLAPG and are contractions of our algebras. Indeed,
Donin, Gurevich and Shnider consider the Lie algebras of functions on the orbits of the
coajoint representation of g with respect to the Poisson bracket. These DGS Lie algebras
are naturally realized as the quotients of the polynomial algebra modulo an inhomogeneous
ideal that singles out the orbit; we realize the result of quantization of DGS Lie algebras by
differential operators.
   In this paper we consider the simplest case of the superization of this construction: replace
sl(2) with osp(1|2). The cases of higher ranks will be considered elsewhere. The Khesin–
Malikov construction [KM] can be applied almost literally to the Lie (super)algebras LUg(λ)
such that g admits a (super)principal embedding, see, e.g., [GL2].
   Our main theorems: 2.6 and 4.3. The structure of the algebras LUg(λ) (real forms,
automorphisms, root systems) will be described elsewhere, see e.g., [LAS].
   Observe that while the polynomial Poisson Lie algebra has only one class of nontrivial
deformations and all the deformed algebras are isomorphic, cf. [LSc1], the dimension of the
space of parameters of deformations of Lie algebras of Donin, Gurevich and Shnider is equal
to the rank of g and all of the deforms are pairwise nonisomorphic, generally.

0.4. The defining relations. The notion of defining relations is clear for a nilpotent Lie
algebra. This is one of the reasons why the most conventional way to present a simple
Lie algebra g is to split it into the direct sum of a (commutative) Cartan subalgebra and 2
maximal nilpotent subalgebras g± (positive and negative). There are about (2·rkg)2 relations
between the 2 · rkg generators of g± . The generators of g+ together with the generators of
g− generate g as well. In g, there are about (3 · rkg)2 relations between these generators;
the relations additional to those in g+ or g− , i.e., between the positive and the negative
generators, are easy to grasp. Though numerous, all these relations — called Serre relations
— are neat and this is another reason for their popularity. These relations are good to deal
with not only for humans but for computers as well, cf. sec. 7.3.
   Nevertheless, it so happens that the Chevalley-type generators and, therefore, the Serre
relations are not always available. Besides, as we will see, there are problems in which other
generators and relations naturally appear, cf. [GL2].
                 LIE SUPERALGEBRAS OF SUPERMATRICES OF COMPLEX SIZE                             5

   Though not so transparent as for nilpotent algebras, the notion of generators and relations
makes sense in the general case. For instance, with the principal embeddings of sl(2) into
g one can associate only two elements that generate g; we call them Jacobson’s generators,
see [GL1]. We explicitly describe the associated with the principal embeddings of sl(2)
presentations of simple Lie algebras, finite dimensional and certain infinite dimensional;
namely, the Lie algebra “of matrices of complex size” realized as a subalgebra of the Lie
algebra diff(1) of differential operators in 1 indeterminate or of gl+ (∞), see §2.
   The relations obtained are rather simple, especially for nonexceptional algebras. In con-
tradistinction with the conventional presentation there are just 9 relations between Jacob-
son’s generators for sl(λ) series (actually, 8 if λ ∈ C \ Z) and not many more for the other
algebras.
   It is convenient to present sl(λ) as the Lie algebra generated by two differential operators:
            d                         d2
X = u2 du
  +
              − (λ − 1)u and Zsl = du   2 ; its Lie subalgebra o/sp(λ) of skew-adjoint operators

— a hybrid of Lie algebras of series o and sp (do not confuse with the Lie superalgebra of
                                                               d3
osp type!) — is generated by the same X + and Zo/sp = du         3 ; to make relations simpler, we
                                    −         d
always add the third generator X = − du . For integer λ each of these algebras has an ideal
of finite codimension and the quotient modulo the ideal is the conventional sl(n) (for λ = n
and gl(λ)) and either o(2n + 1) (for λ = 2n + 1) or sp(2n) (for λ = 2n), respectively , for
o/sp(λ).
   In this paper we superize [GL1]: replace sl(2) with its closest relative, osp(1|2). We denote
by sl(λ|λ + 1) the Lie superalgebra generated by ∇+ = x∂θ + xθ∂x − λθ, Z = ∂x ∂θ − θ∂x 2 and
U = ∂θ − θ∂x , where x is an even indeterminate and θ is an odd one. We define osp(λ + 1|λ)
as the Lie subsuperalgebra of sl(λ|λ + 1) generated by ∇+ and Z. The presentations of
sl(λ|λ + 1) and osp(λ + 1|λ) are associated with the superprincipal embeddings of osp(1|2).
For λ ∈ C \ Z these algebras are simple. For integer λ = n each of these algebras has an
ideal of finite codimension and the quotient modulo the ideal is the conventional sl(n|n + 1)
and osp(2n + 1|2n), respectively.

0.5. Some applications. (1) Integrable systems like continuous Toda lattice or a general-
ization of the Drinfeld–Sokolov construction are based on the superprincipal embeddings in
the same way as the Khesin–Malikov construction [KM] is based on the principal embedding,
cf. [GL2].
   (2) To q-quantize the Lie algebras of type sl(λ) à la Drinfeld, using only Chevalley gener-
ators, is impossible; our generators indicate a way to do it.

0.6. Related topics. We would like to draw attention of the reader to several other
classes of Lie algebras. One of the reasons is that, though some of these classes have empty
intersections with the class of Lie algebras we consider here, they naturally spring to mind
and are, perhaps, deformations of our algebras in some, yet unknown, sense.
   • Krichever–Novikov algebras, see [SH] and refs. therein. The KN-algebras are neither
graded, nor filtered (at least, wrt the degree considered usually). Observe that so are our
algebras LUg(λ) with respect to the degree induced from U(g), so a search for a better
grading is a tempting problem.

   • Continuum algebras, see [SV] and refs. therein. In particular cases these algebras
coincide with Kac–Moody or loop algebras, i.e., have a continuum analog of the Cartan

which replaces the Cartan matrix.

           §1. Recapitulation: finite dimensional simple Lie algebras
   This section is a continuation of [LP], where the case of the simplest base (system of simple
roots) is considered and where non-Serre relations for simple Lie algebras first appear, though
in a different setting. This paper is also the direct superization of [GL1]; we recall its results.
For presentations of Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix via Chevalley generators, see [LS],
[GL3].
   What are “natural” generators and relations for a simple finite dimensional Lie algebra?
The answer is important in questions when it is needed to identify an algebra g given
its generators and relations. (Examples of such problems are connected with Estabrook–
Wahlquist prolongations, Drinfeld’s quantum algebras, symmetries of differential equations,
integrable systems, etc.).

1.0. Defining relations. If g is nilpotent, the problem of its presentation has a natural and
unambiguous solution: representatives of the homology H1 (g) ∼     = g/[g, g] are the generators
of g and the elements from H2 (g) correspond to relations.
   On the other hand, if g is simple, then g = [g, g] and there is no “most natural” way to
select generators of g. The choice of generators is not unique.
   Still, among algebras with the property g = [g, g] the simple ones are distinguished by the
fact that their structure is very well known. By trial and error people discovered that for finite
dimensional simple Lie algebras, there are certain “first among equal” sets of generators:
   1) Chevalley generators corresponding to positive and negative simple roots;
   2) a pair of generators that generate any finite dimensional simple Lie algebra associated
with the principal sl(2)-subalgebra (considered below).
   The relations associated with Chevalley generators are well-known, see e.g., [OV], [K].
These relations are called Serre relations.
   The possibility to generate any simple finite dimensional Lie algebra by two elements was
first claimed by N. Jacobson; for the first (as far as we know) proof see [BO]. We do not
know what generators Jacobson had in mind; [BO] take for them linear combinations of
positive and negative root vectors with generic coefficients; nothing like a “natural” choice
that we suggest to refer to as Jacobson’s generators was ever proposed.
   To generate a simple algebra with only two elements is tempting but nobody yet had
explicitly described relations between such generators, perhaps, because to check whether the
relations between these elements are nice-looking is impossible without a modern computer
(cf. an implicit description in [F]). As far as we could test, the relations for any other pair
of generators chosen in a way distinct from ours are too complicated. There seem to be,
however, one exception cf. [GL2].

1.1. The principal embeddings. There exists only one (up to equivalence) embedding
r : sl(2) −→ g such that g, considered as sl(2)-module, splits into rkg irreducible modules,
cf. [D] or [OV]. This embedding is called principal and, sometimes, minimal because for
the other embeddings (there are plenty of them) the number of irreducible sl(2)-modules
is > rkg. Example: for g = sl(n), sp(2n) or o(2n + 1) the principal embedding is the
one corresponding to the irreducible representation of sl(2) of dimension n, 2n, 2n + 1,
respectively.
   For completeness, let us recall how the irreducible sl(2)-modules with highest weight look
like. (They are all of the form Lµ , where Lµ = M µ if µ 6∈ Z+ , and Ln = M n /M −n−2 if
                   LIE SUPERALGEBRAS OF SUPERMATRICES OF COMPLEX SIZE                               7

n ∈ Z+ , and where M µ is described below.) Select the following basis in sl(2):
                                                                 
                    −       0 0              1 0            +    0 1
                  X =              , H=               , X =              .
                           −1 0              0 −1                0 0
The sl(2)-module M µ is illustrated with a graph whose nodes correspond to the eigenvectors
lµ−2i of H with the weight indicated;
                                        µ−2i−2    µ−2i        µ−2    µ
                                  ...     ◦      − ◦ −···− ◦ − ◦
the edges depict the action of X ± (the action of X + is directed to the right, that of X − to
the left: X − lµ−2i = lµ−2i−2 and
                  X + lµ−2i = X + ((X − )i lµ ) = i(µ − i + 1)lµ−2i+2 ;   X + (lµ ) = 0.        (1.1)
   As follows from (1.1), the module M n for n ∈ Z+ has an irreducible submodule isomorphic
to M −n−2 ; the quotient, obviously irreducible, as follows from the same (1.1), will be denoted
by Ln .
   There are principal sl(2)-subalgebras in every finite dimensional simple Lie algebra, though,
generally, not in infinite dimensional ones, e.g., not in affine Kac-Moody algebras. The con-
struction is as follows. Let X1± , . . . , Xrkg
                                            ±
                                                be Chevalley generators of g, i.e., the generators
corresponding to simple roots. Let the images of X ± ∈ sl(2) in g be
                                         X                 X
                               X − 7→        Xi− ; X + 7→     ai Xi+
and select the ai from the relations [[X + , X − ], X ± ] = ±2X ± true in sl(2). For g constructed
from a Cartan matrix A, there is a solution for ai if and only if A is invertible.
   In Table 1.1 a simple finite dimensional Lie algebra g is described as the sl(2)-module
corresponding to the principal embedding (cf. [OV], Table 4). The table introduces the
number 2k2 used in relations. We set k1 = 1.

   One can show that g can be generated by two elements: x := X + ∈ L2 = sl(2) and a
lowest weight vector z := l−r from an appropriate module Lr other than L2 from Table 1.1.
For the role of this Lr we take either L2k2 if g 6= o(2n) or the last module L2n−2 in the above
table if g = o(2n). (Clearly, z is defined up to proportionality; we will assume that a basis
of Lr is fixed and denote z = t · l−r for some t ∈ C that can be fixed at will, cf. §3.)
   The exceptional choice for o(2n) is occasioned by the fact that by choosing z ∈ Lr for
r 6= 2n − 2 instead, we generate o(2n − 1).
8                               PAVEL GROZMAN, DIMITRY LEITES

  We call the above x and z, together with y := X − ∈ L2 taken for good measure, Jacobson’s
generators. The presence of y considerably simplifies the form of the relations, though slightly
increases their number. (One might think that taking the symmetric to z element lr will
improve the relations even more but in reality just the opposite happens.)
  Concerning g = o(2n) see sec. 7.2.

1.2. Relations between Jacobson’s generators. First, observe that if an ideal of a free
Lie algebra is homogeneous (with respect to the degrees of the generators of the algebra),
then the number and the degrees of the defining relations (i.e., the generators of the ideal)
is uniquely defined provided the relations are homogeneous. This is obvious.
   A simple Lie algebra g, however, is the quotient of a free Lie algebra F modulo a inhomo-
geneous ideal, I, the ideal without homogeneous generators. Therefore, we can speak about
the number and the degrees of relations only conditionally. Our condition is the possibility
to express any element x ∈ I via the generators g1 , ... of I by a formula of the form
                   X
              x=       [ci , gi ], where ci ∈ F and deg ci + deg gi ≤ deg x for all i.    (∗)

   Under condition (∗) the number of relations and their degrees are uniquely determined.
Now we can explain why do we need an extra generator y: without y the weight relations
would have been of very high degree.
   We divide the relations between the Jacobson generators into the types corresponding to
the number of occurrences of z in them: 0. Relations in L2 = sl(2); 1. Relations coming
from the sl(2)-action on L2k2 ; 2. Relations coming from L2k1 ∧ L2k2 ; ≥ 33. Relations coming
from L2k2 ∧ L2k2 ∧ L2k2 ∧ . . . with ≥ 3 factors; among the latter relations we distinguish one
— of type “∞ ∞” — the relation that shears the dimension. (For small rank g the relation of
type ∞ can be of the above types.)
   Observe that, apart form relations of type ∞, the relations of type ≥ 3 are those of type
3 except for e7 which satisfies stray relations of types 4 and 5, cf. [GL1].
   The relations of type 0 are the well-known relations in sl(2)
                        0.1
                        0.1. [[x, y], x] = 2x,      0.2 [[x, y], y] = −2y.                (Rel0)
The relations of type 1 mirror the fact that the space L2k2 is the (2k2 + 1)-dimensional
sl(2)-module. To simplify notations we denote: zi = (adx)i z. Then the type 1 relations are:


    1.1
    1.1. [y, z] = 0, 1.2
                     1.2. [[x, y], z] = −2k2 z, 1.3
                                                1.3. z2k1 +1 = 0 with 2k2 from Table 1.1.. (Rel1)

1.3. Theorem . For the simple finite dimensional Lie algebras all the relations between the
Jacobson generators are the above relations (Rel0), (Rel1) and the relations from [GL1].
    In §3 these relations from [GL1] are reproduced for the classical Lie algebras.

§2. The Lie algebra sl(λ) as a quotient algebra of diff(1) and a subalgebra
                                 of sl+ (∞)
2.1. gl(λ) is endowed with a trace. The Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem states that,
as spaces, U(sl(2)) ∼= C[X − , H, X + ]. We also know that to study representations of g
is the same as to study representations of U(g). Still, if we are interested in irreducible
representations, we do not need the whole of U(g) and can do with a smaller algebra, easier
to study.

  This observation is used now and again; Feigin applied it in [F] writing, actually, (as
deciphered in [PH], [GL1], [Sh]) that setting
                         d            d                       d
               X− = −      , H = 2u − (λ − 1), X + = u2          − (λ − 1)u           (2.1)
                        du           du                      du
we obtain a morphism of sl(2)-modules and, moreover, of associative algebras: U(sl(2)) −→
      d
C[u, du ]. The kernel of this morphism is the ideal generated by ∆ − λ2 + 1, where ∆ =
2(X X + X − X + ) + H 2 . Observe, that this morphism is not an epimorphism, either. The
    + −

image of this morphism is our Lie algebra of matrices of “complex size”.
Remark . In their proof of certain statements from [F] that we will recall, [PH] made use
of the well-known fact that the Casimir operator ∆ acts on the irreducible sl(2)-module Lµ
(see sec 1.1) as the scalar operator of multiplication by µ2 + 2µ. The passage from [PH]’s λ
to [F]’s µ is done with the help of a shift by the weight ρ, a half sum of positive roots, which
for sl(2) can be identified with 1, i.e., (λ − 1)2 + 2(λ − 1) = λ2 − 1 for λ = µ + 1.
  Consider the Lie algebra LU(sl(2)) associated with the associative algebra U(sl(2)). Set
                                Uλ = U(sl(2))/(∆ − λ2 + 1).                           (2.2)
The definition directly implies that gl(−λ) ∼
                                            = gl(λ), so speaking about real values of λ we
can confine ourselves to the nonnegative values, cf. sec. 0.2. It is easy to see that, as
sl(2)-module,
                           LUλ = L0 ⊕ L2 ⊕ L4 ⊕ · · · ⊕ L2n ⊕ . . .                   (2.3)
It is not difficult to show (see [PH] for details) that the Lie algebra LUn for n ∈ Z \ {0}
contains an ideal Jn and the quotient LUn /Jn is the conventional gl(n). In [PH] it is proved
that for λ 6= Z \ {0} the Lie algebra LUλ has only two ideals — the space L0 of constants
and its complement. Set
                                                   (
                                                     LUλ       for λ 6∈ Z \ {0}
                pgl(λ) = gl(λ)/L0 , where gl(λ) =                                        (2.4)
                                                     LUn /Jn for n ∈ Z \ {0}.
  Observe, that gl(λ) is endowed with a trace. This follows directly from (2.3) and the fact
that
                                gl(λ) ∼
                                      = L0 ⊕ [gl(λ), gl(λ)].
Therefore, pgl(λ) can be identified with sl(λ), the subalgebra of the traceless matrices in
gl(λ). We can normalize the trace at will, for example, if we set tr(id) = λ, then the trace
that our trace induces on the quotient of LUsl(2) (n) modulo J(n) coincides with the usual
trace on gl(n) for n ∈ N.
   Another way to introduce the trace was suggested by J. Bernstein. We decipher its
description in [KM] as follows. Look at the image of H ∈ sl(2) in gl(M λ ). Bernstein
observed that though the trace of the image is an infinite sum, the sum of the first D + 1
summands is a polynomial in D, call it tr(H). It is easy to see that tr(H) vanishes if D = λ.
   Similarly, for any x ∈ LUg(λ) considered as an element of gl(M λ ) set
                                                   D
                                                   X
                                      tr(x; D) =         xii .
                                                   i=1

Let D(λ) be the value of the dimension of the irreducible finite dimensional g-module with
highest weight λ, for an exact formula see [D], [OV]. Set tr(x) = tr(x; D(λ)); as is easy to
see, this formula determines the trace on LUg(λ) for arbitrary values of λ.
10                                   PAVEL GROZMAN, DIMITRY LEITES

  Observe that whereas for any irreducible finite dimensional module over the simple Lie al-
gebra g there is just one formula for D(λ) (H. Weyl dimension formulas) for Lie superalgebra
there are several distinct formulas depending on how “typical” λ is.
2.2. There is no Cartan matrix for sl(λ). What replaces it? Are there Chevalley
generators in sl(λ)? In other words are there elements Xi± of degree ±2 and Hi of degree 0
(the degree is the weight with respect to the sl(2) = L2 ⊂ sl(λ)) such that
                    [Xi+ , Xj− ] = δij Hi ,   [Hi , Hj ] = 0 and [Hi , Xj± ] = ±Aij Xj± ?   (2.5)
The answer is NO: sl(λ) is too small. To see what is the problem, consider the following
elements of degree ±2 from L4 and L6 of gl(λ):

                     deg = −2 : −4uD 2 − 2(λ − 2)D
                     deg = 2 :        −4u3 D 2 + 6(λ − 2)u2 D − 2(λ − 1)(λ − 2)u

     deg = −2 : 15u2D 3 − 15(λ − 3)uD 2 + 3(λ − 2)(λ − 3)D
     deg = 2 :    15u4D 3 − 30(λ − 3)u3 D 2 + 18(λ − 2)(λ − 3)u2D − 3(λ − 1)(λ − 2)(λ − 3)u
To satisfy (2.5), we can complete gl(λ) by considering infinite sums of its elements, but the
completion erases the difference between different λ’s:
Proposition . For λ 6= ρ the completion of sl(λ) generated by Jacobson’s generators (see
Tables) is isomorphic to pdiff(1), the quotient of the Lie algebra of differential operators with
formal coefficients modulo constants.
  Though there is no Cartan matrix, Saveliev and Vershik [SV] suggested an operator K
which replaces Cartan matrix. For furtehr details see paper by Shoihet and Vershik [ShV].
2.3. The outer automorphism of LUg(λ). The invariants of the mapping
                 X 7→ −SX t S for X ∈ gl(n), where S = antidiag(1, −1, 1, −1 . . . )        (2.6)
constitute o(n) if n ∈ 2N + 1 and sp(n) if n ∈ 2N. By analogy, Feigin defined o(λ) and sp(λ)
as subalgebras of gl(λ) = ⊕ L2k invariant with respect to the involution analogous to (2.6):
                               k≥0
                                           (
                                            −X          if X ∈ L4k
                                        X→
                                         7                                                  (2.7)
                                            X           if X ∈ L4k+2 .
   Since o(λ) and sp(λ) — the subalgebras of gl(λ) singled out by the involution (2.7) —
differ by a shift of the parameter λ, it is natural to denote them uniformly (but so as not to
confuse with the Lie superalgebras of series osp), namely, by o/sp(λ). For integer values of
the parameter it is clear that
                             
                                o(λ) ⊃
                                     + Iλ if λ ∈ 2N + 1,
                  o/sp(λ) =                               where Iλ is an ideal.
                               sp(λ) ⊃
                                     + Iλ    if λ ∈ 2N,
In the realization of sl(λ) by differential operators the transposition is the passage to the
adjoint operator; hence, o/sp(λ) is a subalgebra of sl(λ) consisting of self-skew-adjoint op-
erators with respect to the involution

2.4. The Lie algebra gl(λ) as a subalgebra of gl+ (∞). Recall that gl+ (∞) often denotes
the Lie algebra of infinite (in one direction; index + indicates that) matrices with nonzero
elements inside a (depending on the matrix) strip along the main diagonal and containing it.
The subalgebras o(∞) and sp(∞) are naturally defined, while sl(∞) is, by abuse of language,
sometimes used to denote pgl(∞).
   When it comes to superization, one shall be very careful selecting an appropriate candidate
for sl(∞|∞) and its subalgebra, cf. [E].
   The realization (2.1) provides with an embedding sl(λ) ⊂ sl+ (∞) = “sl(M λ )”, so for
λ 6= N the Verma module M λ with highest weight µ is an irreducible sl(λ)-module.
Proposition . The completion of gl(λ) (generated by the elements of degree ±2 with respect
to H ∈ sl(2) ⊂ gl(λ)) is isomorphic for any noninteger λ to gl+ (∞) = “gl(M λ )”.
2.5. The Lie algebras sl(∗) and o/sp(∗) for ∗ ∈ CP 1 = C∪{∗}. The “dequantization” of
the relations for sl(λ) and o/sp(λ) (see §3) is performed by passage to the limit as λ −→ ∞
under the change:                      (
                                           t
                                          λ
                                               for sl(λ)
                                  t 7→
                                            t
                                          λ2
                                               for o/sp(λ).
So the parameter λ above can actually run over CP 1 = C∪{∗}, not just C. In the realization
with the help of deformation, cf. 2.7 below, this is obvious. Denote the limit algebras by
sl(∗) and o/sp(∗) in order to distinguish them from sl(∞) and o(∞) or sp(∞) from sec. 2.4.
   It is clear that it is impossible to embed sl(∗) and o/sp(∗) into the “quadrant” algebra
sl+ (∞): indeed, sl(∗) and o/sp(∗) are subalgebras of the whole “plane” algebras sl(∞) and
o(∞) or sp(∞).
2.6. Theorem . For Lie algebras sl(λ) and o/sp(λ), λ ∈ CP 1 , all the relations between the
Jacobson generators are the relations of types 0, 1 with 2k2 found from Table 1.1 and the
borrowed from [GL1] relations from §3.

                   d2                  d3

∞; for n = ∗ ∈ CP 1 the relations are obtained with the substitution 2.5. The parameter t
can be taken equal to 1; we kept it explicit to clarify how to “dequantize” the relations as
λ −→ ∞.

                                       §4. Lie superalgebras
4.0. Linear algebra in superspaces. Superization has certain subtleties, often disre-
garded or expressed too briefly. We will dwell on them a bit, see [L2].
   A superspace is a Z/2-graded space; for a superspace V = V0̄ ⊕ V1̄ denote by Π(V ) another
copy of the same superspace: with the shifted parity, i.e., (Π(V ))ī = Vī+1̄ .
   A superspace structure in V induces that in the space End(V ). A basis of a superspace
is always a basis consisting of homogeneous vectors; let Par = (p1 , . . . , pdim V ) be an ordered
collection of their parities, called the format of (the basis of) V . A square supermatrix of
format (size) Par is a dim V × dim V matrix whose ith row and ith column are said to be of
parity pi . The matrix unit Eij is supposed to be of parity pi + pj and the bracket of super-
matrices (of the same format) is defined via Sign Rule: if something of parity p moves past
something of parity q the sign (−1)pq accrues; the formulas defined on homogeneous elements
are extended to arbitrary ones via linearity. For example: [X, Y ] = XY − (−1)p(X)p(Y ) Y X;
the sign ∧ in what follows is also understood in supersence, etc.
   Usually, Par is considered to be of the form (0̄, . . . , 0̄, 1̄, . . . , 1̄). Such a format is called
standard. The Lie superalgebra of supermatrices of size Par is denoted by gl(Par), usually
gl(0̄, . . . , 0̄, 1̄, . . . , 1̄) is abbreviated to gl(dim V0̄ | dim V1̄ ).
   For dim V0̄ = dim V1̄ ± 1 we will often use another format, the alternating one, Paralt =
(0̄, 1̄, 0̄, 1̄, . . . ).
   The supertrace is the map gl(Par) −→ C, (Aij ) 7→                          (−1)pi Aii . The supertraceless
                                                                             P
matrices constitute a Lie subsuperalgebra, sl(Par).
   To the linear map F of superspaces there corresponds the dual map F ∗ between the dual
superspaces; if A is the supermatrix corresponding to F in a format Par, then to F ∗ the
supertransposed matrix Ast corresponds:
                                   (Ast )ij = (−1)(pi +pj )(pi +p(A)) Aji .
  The supermatrices X ∈ gl(Par) such that
             X st B + (−1)p(X)p(B) BX = 0 for a homogeneous matrix B ∈ gl(Par)
constitute the Lie superalgebra aut(B) that preserves the bilinear form on V with matrix B.
  The superspace of bilinear forms is denoted by BilC (M, N) or BilC (M) if M=N. The
upsetting of forms uf : BilC (M, N) → BilC (N, M), is defined by the formula
                                  B uf (n, m) = (−1)p(n)p(m) B(m, n).
A form B ∈ BilC (M) is called supersymmetric if B uf = B and superskew-symmetric if
B uf = −B.
   Given bases {mi } and {nj } of C-modules M and N and a bilinear form B : M ⊗ N → C,
we assign to B the matrix
                                  (mfB)ij = (−1)p(mi )p(B) B(mi , nj ).
  For a nondegenerate supersymmetric form whose matrix in the standard format is
                                                             
                             1m 0                        0 1n
                    Bm,2n =            , where J2n =              .
                              0 J2n                    −1n 0
The usual notation for aut(Bm|2n ) is ospsy (m|2n) or just osp(m|2n). (Observe that the
passage from V to Π(V ) sends the supersymmetric forms to superskew-symmetric ones,
preserved by ospsk (m|2n) which is isomorphic to osp(m|2n) but has a different matrix real-
ization.)
14                                PAVEL GROZMAN, DIMITRY LEITES

   We will need the orthosymplectic supermatrices in the alternating format; in this format
we take the matrix Bm,2n (alt) = antidiag(1, . . . , 1, −1, . . . , −1) with the only nonzero entries
on the side diagonal, the last n being −1’s. The Lie superalgebra of such supermatrices will
be denoted by osp(altm|2n ), where, as is easy to see, either m = 2n ± 1 or m = 2n.
   There is a 1-parameter family of deformations ospα (4|2) of the Lie superalgebra osp(4|2);
its only explicit description we know (apart from [BGLS], of course) is in terms of Cartan
matrix [GL3].



4.1. The superprincipal embeddings. Not every simple Lie superalgebra, even a finite
dimensional one, hosts a superprincipal osp(1|2)-subsuperalgebra. Let us describe those that
do. (Aside: an interesting problem is to describe semiprincipal embeddings into g, defined
as the ones with the least possible number of irreducible components.)
  We select the following basis in osp(1|2) ⊂ sl(0̄|1̄|0̄):

                                                       

The highest weight osp(1|2)-module Mµ is illustrated with a graph whose nodes correspond
to the eigenvectors li of H with the weight indicated; the horisontal edges depict the X ± -
action (the X + -action is directed to the right, that of X − to the left; each horizontal string
is an irreducible sl(2)-submodule; two such submodules are glued together into an osp(1|2)-
module by the action of ∇± (we set ∇+ (ln ) = 0 and ∇− (li ) = li−1 ; the corresponding edges
are not depicted below); we additionally assume that p(lµ ) = 0̄:

                           µ−2i         µ−2i+2                       µ−2         µ

As follows from the relations of type 0 below in sec 4.2, the module Mn for n ∈ Z+ has
an irreducible submodule isomorphic to Π(M−n−1 ); the quotient, obvoiusly irreducible as
follows from the same formulas, will be denoted by Ln .
   Serganova completely described superprincipal embeddings of osp(1|2) into a simple finite
dimensional Lie superalgebra [LSS] (the main part of her result was independently obtained
in [vJ]).
   As the osp(1|2)-module corresponding to the superprincipal embedding, a simple finite
dimensional Lie superalgebra g is as follows (the missing simple algebras g do not contain a
superprincipal osp(1|2)):

   The Lie superalgebra g of type osp that contains a superprincipal subalgebra osp(1|2) can
be generated by two elements. For such elements we can take X := ∇+ ∈ L2 = osp(1|2)
and a lowest weight vector Z := l−r from the module M = Lr or Π(Lr ), where for M we
take Π(L3 ) if g 6= osp(2n|2m) or the last module with the even highest weight vector in the
above table (i.e., L2n−2 if g = osp(2n|2n) and L2n if g = osp(2n + 2|2n)).
   To generate sl(n|n+1) we have to add to the above X and Z a lowest weight vector U from
Π(L1 ). (Clearly, Z and U are defined up to factors that we can select at our convenience;
we will assume that a basis of Lr is fixed and denote Z = t · l−r and U = s · l−1 for t, s ∈ C.)
   We call the above X and Z, together with U, and fortified by Y := X − ∈ L2 the Jacobson’s
generators. The presence of Y considerably simplifies the form of the relations, though
slightly increases the number of them.

4.2. Relations between Jacobson’s generators. We repeat the arguments from sec.
1.2. Since we obtain the relations recurrently, it could happen that a relation of higher
degree implies a relation of a lower degree. This did not happen when we studied sl(λ), but
does happen in what follows, namely, relation 1.2 implies 1.1.
   We divide the relations between Jacobson’s generators into the types corresponding the
number of occurence of z in them: 0. Relations in sl(1|2) or osp(1|2); 1. Relations coming
from the osp(1|2)-action on L2k2 ; 2. Relations coming from L2k1 ∧ L2k2 ; 3. Relations coming
from L2k2 ∧ L2k2 ; ∞ . Relation that shear the dimension.
   The relations of type 0 are the well-known relations in sl(1|2), those of them that do not
involve U (marked with an ∗) are the relations for osp(1|2). The relations of type 1 that do
not involve U express that the space L2k2 is the osp(1|2)-module with highest weight 2k2 .
To simplify notations we denote: Zi = adX i Z and Yi = adX i Y .

     §5. The Lie superalgebra gl(λ|λ + 1) as the quotient of diff(1|1) and a
                           subalgebra of sl+ (∞|∞)
  There are several ways to superize sl+ (∞|∞). For a description of “the best” one from a
certain point of view see [E]. For our purposes any version of sl+ (∞|∞) will do.
5.1. The Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem states that U(osp(1|2)) ∼
                                                                 = C[X − , ∇− , H, ∇+ , X + ],
                                            2    9                 ∂        ∂
as superspaces. Set Uλ = U(osp(1|2))/(∆ − λ + 4 ). Denote: ∂x = ∂x   , ∂θ = ∂θ and set
X − = −∂x ,   ∇− = ∂θ −θ∂x ,    H = 2x∂x +θ∂θ (λ−1),     ∇+ = x∂θ +xθ∂x −λθ,     X + = x2 ∂x −(λ−1)x.
These formulas establish a morphism of osp(1|2)-modules and, moreover, of associative su-
peralgebras: Uλ −→ C[x, θ, ∂x , ∂θ ].
  In what follows we will need a well-known fact: the Casimir operator
                     ∆ = 2(X + X − + X − X + ) + ∇+ ∇− − ∇− ∇+ + H 2
acts on the irreducible osp(1|2)-module Lµ as the scalar operator of multiplication by µ2 +3µ.
(The passage from µ to λ is done with the help of a shift by 23 .)
  Consider the Lie superalgebra LU(osp(1|2)) associated with the associative superalgebra
Uλ . It is easy to see that, as osp(1|2)-module,
                   LUλ = L0 ⊕ L2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ L2n ⊕ · · · ⊕ Π(L1 ⊕ L3 ⊕ . . . )             (5.1)
  In the same way as for Lie algebras we show that LUn contains an ideal In for n ∈ N \ {0}
and the quotient LUn /In is the conventional sl(n|n + 1). It is clear that for λ 6= Z the Lie
algebra LUλ has only one ideal — the space L0 of constants and LUλ = L0 ⊕ [LUλ , LUλ ];
hence, there is a supertrace on LUλ . This justifies the following notations
                                                           
                               0                               Uλ     for λ 6= N \ {0}
    sl(λ|λ + 1) = gl(λ|λ + 1)/L , where gl(λ|λ + 1) =                                   (5.2)
                                                             LUn /In     otherwise.
The definition directly implies that gl(−λ| − λ + 1) ∼ = gl(λ|λ + 1), so speaking about real
values of λ we can confine ourselves to the nonnegative values.
  Define osp(λ + 1|λ) as the Lie subsuperalgebra of sl(λ|λ + 1) invariant with respect to the
involution                    
                                −X     if X ∈ L4k or X ∈ Π(L4k±1 )
                        X→                                                              (5.3)
                                 X if X ∈ L4k±2 or X ∈ Π(L4k±3 ),
which is the analogue of the map
                               X → −X st    for   X ∈ gl(m|n).                           (5.4)
5.2. The Lie superalgebras sl(∗| ∗ +1) and osp(2 ∗ | ∗ +1), for ∗ ∈ CP 1 = C ∪ {∗}. The
“dequantization” of the relations for sl(λ|λ + 1) and osp(λ + 1|λ) is performed by passage to
the limit as λ −→ ∞ under the change t 7→ λt . We denote the limit algebras by sl(∗| ∗ +1)
and osp(∗ + 1|∗) in order not to mix them with sl(∞|∞ + 1) and osp(∞|∞ + 1), respectively.

                                    §7. Remarks and problems
7.1. On proof. For the exceptional Lie algebras and superalgebras ospα (4|2) the proof is
direct: the quotient of the free Lie algebra generated by x, y and z modulo our relations is the
needed finite dimensional one. For rank g ≤ 12 we similarly computed relations for g = sl(n),
o(2n + 1) and sp(2n); as Post pointed out, together with the result of [PH] on deformation
(cf. 2.7) this completes the proof for Lie algebras. The results of [PH] on deformations can
be directly extended for the case of sl(2) replaced with osp(1|2); this proves Theorem 4.3.
   Our Theorem 2.6 elucidates Proposition 2 of [F]; we just wrote relations explicitely. Feigin
claimed [F] that for sl(λ) the relations of type 3 follow from the decomposition of L2k2 ∧L2k2 ⊂
L2k2 ∧ L2k2 ∧ L2k2 . We verified that this is so not only in Feigin’s case but for all the
above-considered algebras except e6 , e7 and e8 : for the latter one should consider the whole
L2k2 ∧ L2k2 ∧ L2k2 , cf. [GL1]. Theorem 4.3 is a direct superization of Theorem 2.6.

7.2. Problems. 1) How to present o(2n) and osp(2m|2n)? One can select z as suggested
in sec. 1.1. Clearly, the form of z (hence, relations of type 1) and the number of relations
of type 3 depend on n in contradistinction with the algebras considered above. Besides, the
relations are not as neat as for the above algebras. We should, perhaps, have taken the
generators as for o(2n − 1) and add a generator from L2n−2 . We have no guiding idea; to try
at random is frustrating, cf. the relations we got for ospα (4|2).
   2) We could have similarly realized the Lie algebra sl(λ) as the quotient of U(vect(1)),
where vect(1) = derC[u]. However, U(vect(1)) has no center except the constants. What
are the generators of the ideal — the analog of (2.0) — modulo which we should factorize
U(vect(1)) in order to get sl(λ)? (Observe that in case U(g), where g is a simple finite
dimensional Lie superalgebra such that Z(U(g)) is not noetherian, the ideal — the analog
of (5.0) — is, nevertheless, finitely generated, cf. [GL2].)
   3) Feigin realized sl(∗) on the space of functions on the open cell of CP 1 , a hyperboloid,
see [F]. Examples of [DGS] are similarly realized. Give any realization of o/sp(∗) and its
superanalogs.
   4) Other problems are listed in sec. 8.1–8.3 below.

For the other Lie algebras, especially exceptional ones, the comparison is even more un-
favourable. Nevertheless, for sl(λ) with noninteger λ there are only the Jacobson generators
and we have to use them.

    §8. Lie algebras of higher ranks. The analogs of the exponents and
                                W -algebras
   The following Tables 8.1 and 8.2 introduce the generators for the Lie algebras Ug(λ) and
the analogues of the exponents that index the generalized W -algebras (for their definition in
the simplest cases from different points of view see [FFr] and [KM]; we will follow the lines
of [KM]).
   Recall that (see 0.1) one of the definitions of Ug(λ) is as the associative algebra generated
                                  .
by g̃; we loosely denote it by S̃ (g̃). For the generators of LUg(λ) we take the Chevalley
generators of g (since by 7.3 they are more convenient) and the lowest weight vectors of the
irreducible g-modules that constitute S̃ 2 (g̃).
8.1. The exponents. This section is just part of Table 1 from [OV] reproduced here for
the convenience of the reader. Recall that if g is a simple (finite dimensional) Lie algebra,
W = Wg is its Weyl group, l = rk g, α1 , . . . , αl the simple roots, α0 the lowest root; the
ni the coefficients of linear relation among the αi normed so that n0 = 1; let c = r1 · · · · · rl ,
where ri are the reflections from W associated with the simpleP     roots, be the Killing–Coxeter
element. The order h of c (the Coxeter number) is equal to i>0 ni . The eigenvalues of c
are εk1 , . . . , εkl , where ε is a primitive h-th root of unity. The numbers ki are called the
exponents. Then
   The exponents ki are the    P respectiveP numbers ki from Table 1.1, e.g., k1 = 1. The number
of roots of g is equal to l i>0 ni = 2 i>0 ki . The order of W is equal to
                                            Y       Y
                                        zl!    ni =    (ki + 1),
                                                  i>0

where z is the number of 1’s among the ni ’s for i > 0 (the number z is also equal to the
order of the centrum Z(G) of the simply connected Lie group G with the Lie algebra g).
The algebra of W -invariant polynomials on the maximal diagonalizable (Cartan) subalgebra
of g is freely generated by homogeneous polynomials of degrees ki + 1.

  We will use the following notations:
  For a finite dimensional irreducible representations of finite dimensional simple Lie algebras
R(λ) denotes the irreducible representation with highest weight λ and V (λ) the space of this
representation;
  ρ = 21
         P
             α or ρ is a weight such that ρ(αi ) = Aii for each simple root αi .
        α>0
   The weights of the Lie algebras o(2l) and o(2l + 1), sp(2l) and f4 (l = 4) are expressed
in terms of an orthonormal basis ε1 , . . . , εl of the space h∗ over Q. The weights of the
Lie algebras sl(l + 1) as well as e7 , e8 and g2 (l = 7, 8 and 2, respectively)   are expressed in
                                                   ∗
terms of vectors ε1 , . . . , εl+1 of the space h over Q such that
                                                                       P
                                                                         εi = 0. For these vectors
              l                    1
(εi , εi ) = l+1 and (εi , εj ) = l+1  for i 6= j. The indices in the expression of any weight are
assumed to be different.
   The analogues of the exponents for LUg(λ) are the highest weights of the representations
that constitute S̃ k (g̃).
Problem . Interprete these exponents in terms of the analog of the Weyl group of LUg(λ)
in the sence of [PS] and invariant polynomials on LUg(λ).
8.2. Table. The Lie algebras Ug(λ) as g-modules. Columns 2 and 3 of this Table are
derived from Table 5 in [OV]. Columns 4 and 5 are results of a computer-aided study. To
fill in the gaps is a research problem, cf. [GL2] for the Lie algebras different from sl type.

    Xi− (zj ) = 0;    hi (zj ) = weighti (zj );   (adXi+ )the power determined by the weight ofzj (zj ) = 0.

Problem . Give an explicit form of the relations of higher types.
8.3. Tougher problems. Even if the explicit realization of the exceptional Lie algebras by
differential operators on the base affine space were known at the moment, it is, nevertheless,
a difficult computer problem to fill in the blank spaces in the above table and similar tables
for Lie superalgebras. To make plausible conjectures we have to compute S̃ k (g̃) to, at least,
k = 4.
   Observe that for simple Lie algebras g we have a remarkable theorem by Kostant which
states that Ug(λ) contains every finite dimensional irreducible g-module V with multiplicity
equal to the multiplicity of the zero weight in V ; in view of which only the sl(2)-line is
complete.

               §9. A connection with integrable dynamical systems
  We recall the basic steps of the Khesin–Malikov construction and then superize them.

9.1. The Hamilton reduction. Let (M 2n , ω) be a symplectic manifold with an action act
of a Lie group G on M by symplectomorphisms (i.e., G preserves ω). The derivative of the
G-action gives rise to a Lie algebra homomorphism a : g = Lie(G) −→ h(2n). The action
act, or rather, a is called a Poisson one, if a can be lifted to a Lie algebra homomorphism
ã : g −→ po(2n), where the Poisson algebra po(2n) is the nontrivial central extension of
h(2n).
   For any Poisson G-action on M there arises a G-equivariant map p : M −→ g∗ , called the
moment map, given by the formula
                            hp(x), gi = ã(g)(x) for any x ∈ M, g ∈ g.
  Fix b ∈ g∗ ; let Gb ⊂ G be the stabilizer of b. Under certain regularity conditions (see [Ar])
p−1 (b)/Gb is a manifold. This manifold is endowed with the symplectic form
            ω(v̄, w̄) = ω(v, w) for arbitrary preimages v, w of v̄, w̄, respectively
                    wrt the natural projection T (p−1 (b)) −→ T (p−1 (b)/Gb ).
The passage from M to p−1 (b)/Gb is called Hamilton reduction. In the above picture M can
be the Poisson manifold, i.e., ω is allowed to be nondegenerate not on the whole M; the
submanifolds on which ω is nondegenerate are called symplectic leaves.
  Example. Let g = sl(n) and M = g∗ , let G be the group N of uppertriangular matrices
with 1 on the diagonal. The coadjoint N-action on g∗ is a Poisson one, the moment map is
the natural projection g∗ −→ n∗ and g∗ /N is a Poisson manifold.

9.2. The Drinfeld–Sokolov reduction. Let g = â(1) , where a is a simple finite dimen-
sional Lie algebra (the case a = sl(n) is the one considered by Gelfand and Dickii), hat
denotes the Kac–Moody central extension. The elements of M = g∗ , can be identified with
the a-valued differential operators:
                                                       d dt
                                  (f (t)dt, az ∗ ) 7→ (tf (t) + at
                                                         )) .
                                                      dt t
Let N be the loop group with values in the group generated by positive roots of a. For the
point b above take the element y ∈ a ⊂ ĝ∗ described in §3. If a = sl(n), we can represent

   The Drinfeld–Sokolov construction [DS], as well as its generalization to sl(λ) and o/sp(λ)
([KM]), hinges on a certain element that can be identified with the image of X + ∈ sl(2)
under the principal embedding. For the case of higher ranks this is the image in Ug(λ) of the

element y ∈ g described in §3 for Lie algebras. In sl(λ) and o/sp(λ) this image is just dx (or
the matrix whose only nonzero entries are the 1’s under the main diagonal in the realization
of sl(λ) and o/sp(λ) by matrices).

9.4.1 Basics. Further facts from Linear Algebra in Superspaces.
   The tensor algebra T (V ) of the superspace V is naturally defined: T (V ) = n≥0 T n (V ),
                                                                                            L

where T 0 (V ) = k and T n (V ) = V ⊗ · · · ⊗ V (n factors) for n > 0.
   The symmetric algebra of the superspace V is S(V ) = T (V )/I, where I is the two-sided
ideal generated by v1 ⊗ v2 − (−1)p(v1 )p(v2 ) v2 ⊗ v1 for v1 , v2 ∈ V .
   The exterior algebra of the superspace V is E(V ) = S(Π(V )). Clearly, both the exterior
and symmetric algebras of the superspace V are supercommutative superalgebras. It is
worthwhile to mention that if V0̄ 6= 0 and V1̄ 6= 0, then both E(V ) and S(V ) are infinite
dimensional.
   A Lie superalgebra is defined with Sign Rule applied to the definition of a Lie algebra.
Its multiplication is called bracket and is usually denoted by [·, ·] or {·, ·}. If, however, we
try to use this definition in attempts to apply the standard group-theoretical methods to
differential equations on supermanifolds we will find ourselves at a loss: the supergroups and
their modules are objects from different categories! Accordingly, the following (equivalent
to the conventional, “naive” one, see [L1]) definition becomes useful: a Lie superalgebra is a
superalgebra g (defined over a field or, more generally, a supercommutative superalgebra k);
the bracket should satisfy the following conditions: [X, X] = 0 and [Y, [Y, Y ]] = 0 for any
X ∈ (C ⊗ g)0̄ and Y ∈ (C ⊗ g)1̄ and any supercommutative superalgebra C (the bracket in
C ⊗ g is defined via C-linearity and Sign Rule).
   With an associative (super)algebra A we associate Lie (super)algebras (1) AL with the
same (super)space A and the multiplication (a, b) 7→ [a, b] and (2) derA, the algebra of
derivations of A, defined via Sign and Leibniz Rules.
   From a Lie superalgebra g we construct an associative superalgebra U(g), called the uni-
versal enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra g by setting U(g) = T (g)/I, where I is the
two-sided ideal generated by the elements x ⊗ y − (−1)p(x)p(y) y ⊗ x − [x, y] for x, y ∈ g.
   The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem for Lie algebras extends to Lie superalgebras with
the same proof (beware Sign Rule) and reads as follows:
   if {Xi } is a basis in g0̄ and {Yj } is a basis in g1̄ , then the monomials Xin11 . . . Xinrr Yjε11 . . . Yjεss ,
where ni ∈ Z+ and εj = 0, 1, constitute a basis in the space U(g).
   A superspace M is called a left module over a superalgebra A (or a left A-module) if there
is given an even map act: A ⊗ M → M such that if A is an associative superalgebra with
unit, then (ab)m = a(bm) and 1m = m and if A is a Lie superalgebra, then [a, b]m =
a(bm) − (−1)p(a)p(b) b(am) for any a, b ∈ A and m ∈ M. The definition of a right A-module
is similar.
Convention . We endow every module M over a supercommutative superalgebra C with a
two-sided module structure: the left module structure is recovered from the right module
one and vice versa according to the formula cm = (−1)p(m)p(c) mc for any m ∈ M and c ∈ C.
Such modules will be called C-modules. (Over C, there are two canonical ways to define a
two-sided module structure, see [L2]; the meaning of such an abundance is obscure.)
   The functor Π is, actually, tensoring by Π(Z). So there are two ways to apply Π to C-
modules: to get Π(M) = Π(Z) ⊗Z M and (M)Π = M ⊗Z Π(Z). The two-sided module
structures on Π(M) and (M)Π are given via Sign Rule.
   Sometimes, instead of the map act a morphism ρ : A → EndM is defined if A is an
associative superalgebra (or ρ : A −→ (EndM)L if A is a Lie superalgebra); ρ is called a
representation of A in M.
   The simplest (in a sense) modules are those which are irreducible. We distinguish irre-
ducible modules of G-type (general); these do not contain invariant subspaces different from
0 and the whole module; and their “odd” counterparts, irreducible modules of Q-type, which
24                               PAVEL GROZMAN, DIMITRY LEITES

do contain an invariant subspace which, however, is not a subsuperspace. Consequently,
Schur’s lemma states that over C the centralizer of a set of irreducible operators is either C
or C ⊗ Cs = Q(1; C), see the definition of the superalgebras Q below.
    The next in terms of complexity are indecomposable modules, which cannot be split into
the direct sum of invariant submodules.
    A C-module is called free if it is isomorphic to a module of the form C ⊕ · · · ⊕ C ⊕ Π(C) ⊕
· · · ⊕ Π(C) (C occurs r times, Π(C) occurs s times).
    The rank of a free C-module M is the element rkM = r + sε from the ring Z[ε]/(ε2 − 1).
Over a field, C = k, we usually write just dim M = (r, s) or r|s and call this pair the
superdimension of M.
    The module M ∗ = HomC (M, C) is called dual to a C-module M. If (·, ·) is the pairing
of modules M ∗ and M, then to each operator F ∈ HomC (M, N), where M and N are C-
modules, there corresponds the dual operator F ∗ ∈ HomC (N ∗ , M ∗ ) defined by the formula
               (F (m), n∗ ) = (−1)p(F )p(m) (m, F ∗ (n∗ )) for any m ∈ M, n∗ ∈ N ∗ .
Over a supercommutative superalgebra C a supermatrix is a supermatrix with entries from
C, the parity of the matrix with only (i, j)-th nonzero element c is equal to p( i) + p( j) + p(c).
Denote by Mat(Par; C) the set of Par × Par matrices with entries from a supercommutative
superalgebra C.
  The even invertible elements from Mat(Par; C) constitute the general linear group GL(Par; C).
Put GQ(Par; C) = Q(Par; C) ∩ GL(Par; C).
  On the group GL(Par; C) an analogue of the determinant is defined; it is called the
Berezinian (in honour of F. A. Berezin who discovered it). In the standard format the
explicit formula for the Berezinian is:
                                   
                                AB
                          Ber           = det(A − BE −1 D) det E −1 .
                                DE
For the matrices from GL(Par; C) the identity Ber XY = Ber X · Ber Y holds, i.e., Ber :
GL(Par; C) → GL(1|0; C) = GL(0|1; C) is a group homomorphism. Set SL(Par; C) = {X ∈
GL(Par; C) : BerX = 1}. The orthosymplectic group of automorphisms of the bilinear form
with the even canonical matrix is denoted (in the standard format) by Osp(n|2m; C).
9.4.2. Pseudodiferential operators on the supercircle. Residues. Let V be a super-
space. For θ = (θ1 , . . . , θn ) set
                      V [x, θ] = V ⊗ K[x, θ]; V [x−1 , x, θ] = V ⊗ K[x−1 , x, θ];
                                    V [[x−1 , θ]] = V ⊗ K[[x−1 , θ]];
                                   V ((x, θ)) = V ⊗ K[[x−1 ]][x, θ].
We call V ((x, θ))xλ the space of pseudodifferential symbols. Usually, V is a Lie (super)algebra.
Such symbols correspond to pseudodifferential operators (pdo) of the form
                                  n
                                  X        X
                                                      ai (∂x )k0 θ1k1 . . . θnkn ,
                                 i=−∞ k0 +···+kn =i

Here ki = 0 or 1 P
                 for i > 0 and ai (x, θ) ∈ V . This is clear.P
  For any P =        Pi xi θ0k θj ∈ V ((x, θ)) we call P+ =         Pi xi θ0k θj the differential part of
             Pi≤m i k j                                     i,j,k≥0
P and P− =        Pi x θ0 θ the integral part of P .
              i,k<0
  The space ΨDO of pdos is, clearly, the left module over the algebra F of functions. Define
the left ΨDO-action on F from the Leibniz formula thus making ΨDO into a superalgebra.
                   LIE SUPERALGEBRAS OF SUPERMATRICES OF COMPLEX SIZE                            25

  Define the involution in the superalgebra ΨDO setting
                           (a(t, θ)D i D̃ j )∗ = (−1)jip(D̃)p(D) D̃ j D i a∗ (x, θ).
   The following fact is somewhat unexpected. If D is an odd differential operator, then D 2 is
well-defined as 21 [D, D]. Hence, we can consider the set V ((x, θ))xλ for an odd x! Therefore,
there are two types of pdos: contact ones, when D 2 6= 0 for odd D’s and general ones, when
all odd D’s are nilpotent.
   For the definition of distinguished stringy superalgebgras crucial in what follows see
[GLS1].
Conjecture . There exists a residue for all distinguished dimensions, i.e. for the contact type
pdos in dimensions 1|n for n ≤ 4 and for the general pdos in dimensions 1|n for n ≤ 2.
   So far, however, the residue was defined only for contact type pdos, of kL type, and only
for n = 1 at that.
                                                          Pi xi θ0k θj ∈ V ((x, θ0 , θ)) for n = 1.
                                                       P
   Let us extend [MR] and define the residue of P =
                                                                 i≤m
We can do it thanks to the following exceptional property of kL (1|1) and kM (1|1). Indeed,
                                     ∂
over kL (1|1), the volume form “dt ∂θ  ” is, more or less, dθ: consider the quotient Ω1 /F α, where
α is the contact form preserved by kL (1|1); similarly, over kM (1|1), the transformation rules
      ∂
of dt ∂θ ” and α̃, where α̃ is the contact form preserved by kM (1|1), are identical. Therefore,
define the residue by the formula
                                                     θ
                       Res P = coefficient of          in the expansion of P−1 .
                                                     x

Remark . Manin and Radul [MR] considered the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili hierarchy associ-
ated with ns, i.e., for D = Kθ . The formula for the residue allows one to directly generalize
their result and construct a simialr hierarchy associated with r, i.e., for D = K̃θ .
  This new phenomenon — an invertible odd symbol — doubles the old picture: let θ0 be
the symbol of D, and let x be the symbol of the differential operator D 2 . We see that the
case of the odd D reduces to either V ((x, θ0 , θ))xλ or V ((x, θ0−1 , θ))xλ .

9.5. Continuous Toda lattices. Khesin and Malikov [KM] considered straightforward
generalizations of the Toda lattices — the dynamical systems on the orbits of the coadjoint
representation of a simple finite diminsional Lie group G defined as follows. Let X be the
image of X + ∈ sl(2) in g = Lie(G) under the principal embedding. Having identified g with
g∗ with the help of the invariant nondegenerate form, consider the orbit OX . On OX , the
traces Hi (A) = tr(A + X )i are the commuting Hamiltonians.
  In our constructions we only have to consider in LUg(λ) either (for Lie algebras) the
image of X or (for Lie superalgebras) the image of ∇+ ∈ osp(1|2) under the superprincipal
embedding of osp(1|2). For superalgebras we also have to replace trace with the supertrace.
  For the general description of dynamical systems on the orbits of the coadjoint represen-
tations of Lie supergroups see [LST]. A possibility of odd mechanics is pointed out in [LST]
and in the subsequent paper by R. Yu. Kirillova in the same Procedings. To take such a
possibility into account, we have to consider analogs of the principal embeddings for sq(2).
This is a full-time job; its results will be considered elsewhere.
