Introduction
    The aim of this paper is to state the author's results on the global theory of zeta
functions associated with prehomogeneous vector spaces and give an introduction
to equivariant Morse stratications and their rationality.
    Let Z; Q; R; C be the set of integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex
numbers respectively. Let k be a number eld, and ok its integer ring. Let A and
A  be the sets of adeles and ideles of k respectively. We use the notation jxj for
the adelic absolute value of x 2 A . Also let jxj1 be the product of absolute values
of x at all the innite places.
    Let G be a connected reductive group, V a representation of G, and V an
indivisible non-trivial character of G all dened over k. In this paper, we are
mainly interested in the case when G is a product of GL(n)'s. The triple (G; V; V )
is called a prehomogeneous vector space if the following two conditions are satised.
    (1) There exists a Zariski open orbit.
    (2) There exists a polynomial 0 6=  2 k[V ] such that (gx) = 0 (g)(x) where
0 is a rational character, proportional to V .

   A polynomial  which satises the property (2) is called a relative invariant
polynomial. We dene Vkss = fx 2 Vk j (x) 6= 0g, and call it the set of semi-stable
points. For practical purposes, we assume that there exists a one dimensional
split torus T0 contained in the center of G such that if  2 T0, it acts on V by
multiplication by  and V () = e for some e > 0.
   Our purpose in this paper is to outline the author's program to compute Laurent
expansions at poles of zeta functions for prehomogeneous vector spaces when the
group is a product of GL(n)'s.
   The notion of prehomogeneous vector spaces and their zeta functions was in-
troduced by Sato and Shintani in [17]. However, some special cases were studied
earlier by many mathematicians, most notably Siegel [20] and Davenport [4]. Nei-
ther Siegel nor Davenport used the zeta function explicitly to obtain the density
theorems for equivalence classes of quadratic forms [20] and binary cubic forms [4].
Davenport's result was later used by Davenport and Heilbronn [5], [6] to prove the
density theorem for cubic extensions of Q, which states
                                    X           x ;
                                          1   (3)

                                   jk j1 x
where k runs through all the cubic elds and k is the discriminant of k.
   D. J. Wright and the author proved in [23] that generic Gk -orbits of several
\parabolic type" prehomogeneous vector spaces correspond almost bijectively with
number eld extensions of certain degrees. Therefore, by studying the global and
the local zeta functions for those cases, we can expect certain density theorems
where number elds are counted possibly with some weights.
   Let L  Vkss be a Gk -invariant subset, and  a Schwartz{Bruhat function on VA .
Let ! be a character of GA =Gk . Consider an integral of the following form
                                  Z                            X
(0:1)             ZL(; !; s) =                jV (g)js!(g)         (gx)dg;
                                      GA =Gk                   x2L
where dg is a Haar measure on GA . If (0:1) is well dened for L = Vkss and Re(s)
suciently large, we say that (G; V; V ) is of complete type. Otherwise, we say that
(G; V; V ) is of incomplete type. If (G; V; V ) is a prehomogeneous vector space of
complete type, the zeta function is, by denition, the integral ZVkss (; !; s).
   Suppose that (G; V; V ) is a prehomogeneous vector spaceof complete type. Then
the meromorphic continuation and the functional equation of the zeta function were
proved by reducing the problem to the local theory at innite places (see [17], [15]).
Therefore, in most cases, the Tauberian theorem implies the existence of a limit of
the form                         X
                                        y  cxa(log x)b ;
                             y2Gok nVossk
                             jP (y)j1 x
where y is a number determined by the stabilizer of y, and c; a; b are constants. The
improved version of the Tauberian theorem in [17] gives us the error term estimate
also. However, the existence of a similar limit for Gk -orbits is unknown for most
cases and does not automatically follow from the the meromorphic continuation
                                                2
and the functional equation of the zeta function, or the knowledge of the location
and the orders of the poles. The process to handle Gk -orbits of prehomogeneous
vector spaces from the viewpoint of zeta function theory is called the \ltering
process" and was formulated by Datskovsky and Wright [3]. This process has to be
modied for the general case, because the zeta function can have higher order poles
in general, and it is likely that the possible generalization of this process requires
answers to the following two problems.
   Problem A Determine the Laurent expansions at all the poles of the zeta function.
   Problem B Compute the local zeta function explicitly for special test functions.
   If we use the ltering process, the only pole we can use is the rightmost pole.
However, it is likely that all the poles have to be studied in order to say anything
about the rightmost pole. The author's approach to Problem A is a generalization
of Shintani's approach in [18], and is based on the framework of equivariant Morse
theory. We give an introduction to invariant theory and related materials for the
sake of number theorists in x1,2.                                      P
   If f (s) is a meromorphic function having the Laurent expansion ai (s s0 )i at
s = s0, we call ai 's generalized special values of f at s = s0 . Roughly speaking, we
want to express the coecients of the Laurent expansions at the poles of the zeta
function by the generalized special values of the zeta functions which correspond
to \unstable strata" in equivariant Morse theory.
   Let G1A = fg 2 GA j jV (g)j = 1g. ItPis easy to prove (see [17]) that if (G; V; V )
is of complete type and the function x2Vk (gx) is integrable on G1A =Gk , all the
poles of the zeta function are simple and the residues can be computed. However,
this assumption hardly applies to any important cases. Even though Siegel [20]
and Davenport [4] essentially computed the residue of the zeta function at the
rightmost pole for their cases, Shintani's work on the space of binary cubic forms
is the rst non-trivial work where Problem A was answered from the viewpoint of
zeta function theory.
   The primary diculty of Problem A is based on the diculty of handling di-
vergent integrals. So far, our main analytic tool to handle this diculty is the
smoothed Eisenstein series and the iterated use of the Poisson summation formula.
We discuss the smoothed Eisenstein series in x5 and describe our program in x7.
   Among the eight cases in [23], four types (C2; D4 ; D5 ; E6) are of incomplete
type. Also even if we start with a prehomogeneous vector space of complete type,
we have to face prehomogeneous vector spaces of incomplete type in the induction
step anyway. In that case, we have to use generalized special values of the \adjusted
zeta functions" (see [26]). For this reason, understanding of prehomogeneous vector
spaces of incomplete type is essential to the entire theory. Therefore, from the
viewpoint of Problem A, we can not restrict ourselves to prehomogeneous vector
spaces of complete type.
   There are not so many prehomogeneous vector spaces of incomplete type for
which the Laurent expansions at the poles of the zeta function is known. The space
of binary quadratic forms is an example of such a case. The diculty of handling
prehomogeneous vector spaces of incomplete type is that some semi-stable points
have extra stabilizing elements. As is shown in [19], [25], [26] the zeta function
itself does not satisfy a functional equation. Instead, it is natural to consider an
adjusted version of the zeta function. We discuss this issue in x6.

   In x8, we list some examples of prehomogeneous vector spaces for which Problem
A was answered.

x1 Review of invariant theory
    In this section, we review invariant theory and equivariant Morse theory. We do
not restrict ourselves to prehomogeneous representations in this section.
    Let k be a perfect eld. Let G be a split connected reductive group and V a
representation of G both dened over k. This G does not correspond to the group
G in the introduction. Instead, it corresponds to G0 = Ker(V ). Note that since G
is connected and V is indivisible, G0 is connected.
    For any group G over k, let X  (G); X (G) be the groups of rational characters,
rational one parameter subgroups (which we abbreviate to \1PS" from now on) of
G respectively. We choose a maximal split torus T  G. We dene t = X (T ) 

R; t = X  (T ) 
 R. Let tQ = X (T ) 
 Q; tC = X (T ) 
 C etc. Elements in
tQ ; tQ are called rational elements. We x a Weyl group invariant inner product
( ; ) on t . We assume that if z; z0 2 tQ , then (z; z0 ) 2 Q. Let k k be the metric
dened by this inner product. We choose a split Borel subgroup T  B and a
Weyl chamber t  t so that the weights of the unipotent radical of B belong to
t by the conjugation b ! tbt 1. We can identify t; t by this inner product, and
therefore, we consider k k; t for t also.
    We recall the denition of stability over k. Let  : V n f0g ! P(V ) be the
natural projection map. Let k[V ]Gk be the ring of polynomials invariant under the
action of Gk . Suppose that P 2 k[V ]Gk is a homogeneous polynomial. We dene
P(V )P = f (x) j P (x) 6= 0g.
Denition (1.1) Let y 2 P(V )k . We dene
(1) y is semi-stable if there exists a homogeneous polynomial P 2 k[V ]Gk such that
y 2 P(V )P ,
(2) y is properly stable if there exists a homogeneous polynomial P 2 k[V ]Gk such
that y 2 P(V )P , all the orbits in P(V )P are closed, and the stabilizer of y in Gk is
nite,
(3) y is unstable if it is not semi-stable.
    We use the notation P(V )ssk (resp. P(V )s(0)k ) for the set of semi-stable (resp.
properly stable) points. These are Gal(k=k)-invariant opensets of P(V )k . However,
we will consider the set P(V )s(0)k in number theoretic situations only when P(V )ssk =
P(V )s(0)k .
    We will recall three equivalent denitions of the equivariant Morse stratication
for the rest of this section. The rst denition is invariant theoretic and is closely
related to the Hilbert{Mumford criterion of stability. We need this denition,
because we are interested in the rationality question in number theoretic situations.
This approach is due to Kempf and Ness. The second denition is combinatorial
and was given by both Kirwan and Ness. We need this denition for practical
determination of the equivariant Morse stratication. The third denition is Morse
                                           4
theoretic and is based on the convexity property of the moment map. The moment
map and the Morse theoretic approach was used by Kirwan to prove the smoothness
and the perfectness of the stratication when k = C .
(1) The invariant theoretic denition.
   Let k be an algebraically closed eld. We are only interested in the plain stability,
so our situation corresponds to the case S = f0g in [8]. Let X be a variety and
f : G m ! X a morphism. We imbed G m to the one dimensional ane space A1
in the usual manner. We say that lim!0 f () = y if f extends to a morphism
from A1 to X and f (0) = y. If  is a 1PS of G, we dene P () = fp 2 G j
lim!0 ()p() 1 exists g. The group P () is a parabolic subgroup of G.
   Let x 2 V n f0g. We dene jV; xj (resp. jV; xjf0g ) to be the set of 1PS's  such
that lim!0 ()x exists (resp. lim!0 ()x = 0). Let  be a non-trivial 1PS  P  of G
                                                                                 N
(not necessarily in jV; xj). We consider when  belongs to jV; xPjf0g . Let x = i=1 xi
be the eigen decomposition with respect to , i.e. ()x = Ni=1 pi xi , xi 6= 0 for
all i, and pi 6= pj if i 6= j .
Denition (1.2)
                                                N
(1)                               (x; ) = min
                                             i=1 i
                                                   p;
(2)                                (x; ) = (kx;k) :

  If 1; 2 are two non-trivial proportional 1PS's, then  (x; 1 ) =  (x; 2 ).
  The following theorem is Theorem (3.4) [8] ((1),(2) were proved by Mumford in
Proposition 2.17 [12]).
Theorem (1.3)
(1) The function  (x; ) has a maximum value (which we denote by Bx) on the set
jV; xj if it is not empty.
(2) The condition Gx3 0 is equivalent to the condition that jV; xjf0g is non-empty.
   Suppose that jV; xjf0g is non-empty, and let x be the set of indivisible 1PS 's
such that  (; x) = Bx.
(3) The set x is non-empty, and there exits a parabolic subgroup Px of G such that
Px = P () for all  2 x.
(4) The set x is a principal homogeneous space under the action of the unipotent
radical of Px.
(5) Any maximal torus of Px contains a unique element of x.
   We followed [8] for the denition of (x; ). However, this is L (x; ) in [12].
Roughly speaking, if x 2 V corresponds to a geometric object, elements of x are
1PS's which give the fastest degeneration of x. Now we are ready to state the
stratication dened by Ness [13].
   Suppose that x 2 V n f0g, and (x) is unstable. This means that x is non-
empty. There is a unique 1PS  2 t such that  is conjugate to any element
of x. Let 0 2 x. Let x 2 t be the element which is proportional to  and
kxk =  (x; 0 ). This x is uniquely determined by x, and is a rational element.
                                            5
   For  2 t \ tQ , we dene
(1:4)                        S = fx 2 V n f0g j x =  g:
Let S0 =  1(P(V )ss). Apparently,
                                                   a
                                    V n f0g =           S ;
                                                    
where  runs through all the elements of t \ tQ . It turns out that we only have to
consider nitely many such  's. We discuss this issue in the second denition. In
[13], Ness used the notion of the lengths of vectors (see [9]) to formulate the strati-
cation. The fact that the formulation in [9] is equivalent to the above formulation
is explained in Lemma 3.1 [10].
    Hilbert-Mumford criterion of stability says that a point is semi-stable or properly
stable if and only if it is stable or properly stable with respect to the action of all
the non-trivial 1PS's. The above theorem implies that if a point is unstable, there
is a canonical choice of a 1PS which, in a way, gives the worst degeneration of x.
Since we are interested in number theoretic applications, one natural question is if
we can choose such a 1PS which is split over the ground eld. This question was
answered armatively by Kempf [8].
    The following theorem was proved by Kempf (Theorem (4.2) [8]).
Theorem (1.5) Suppose that x 2 Vk , and jV; xjf0g is non-empty over the closure
k. Then all the elements in x are split, Px is rationally conjugate to a standard
parabolic subgroup, and x is a principal homogeneous space under the action of
the k-points of the unipotent radical of Px.
    The above theorem was proved without the assumption that the group is split.
This theorem implies that if x 2 Vk and jV; xjf0g is non-empty over the closure k,
x is conjugate to y 2 Vk by an element of Gk and y contains a split 1PS of T . We
discuss the inductive structure of S and its rationality in the next denition.
(2) The combinatorial denition
    Let k; G; V etc. be as before. We can diagonalize the action of T because k
is a perfect eld. Let (x0 ;    ; xN ) be a coordinate system of V whose coordinate
vectors are eigenvectors of T . Let i 2 t be the weight determined by the i-th
coordinate. The following denition is due to Kirwan.
Denition (1.6) A point  2 tQ is called a minimal combination of weights if  is
the closest point to the origin of the convex hull of a nite subset of f1;    ; N g.
    We denote the set of minimal combination of weights which lie in t by B. In
this denition, B is the index set of the stratication. Since B is a nite set, this
means that the stratication is a nite stratication. It turns out that S0 is the
set of semi-stable points. We describe the stratum S for  2 B n f0g. The reader
should note that S can be the empty set.
    We change the ordering of f1;    ; N g = f10 ;    ; N0 g so that
                                (10 ;  )      (N0 ;  ):
                                               6
We assume that
                                                n               n                     np
         0                  0         1 z    }| 1    {  z     }|2     { z }| {
      ((1 ;  );    ; (N ;  )) = (m1;    ; m1; m2 ;    ; m2;    ; mp;    ; mp)
                                      m0
where m0 > 0; m1 <    < mp are coprime integers. Since  2 B, there exists some
1  s  p such that mm0s = k k2. Let e0i be the coordinate vector which corresponds
to i0. Let Vb be the subspace spanned by
                                                           mb g:
                                       fe0i j (i0 ;  ) = m
                                                             0
We dene
                        Z = b=sVb; W = b>sVb; Y = Z  W ;
          Z = f(x) j x 2 Z n f0gg; Y = f(x; y) j x 2 Z n f0g; y 2 W g;
                                   M = fg 2 G j Ad(g) =  g:
The group M is Stab in [10].
    Let p : Y ! Z be the projection map. Let  be the indivisible rational
character of M whose restriction to T is a positive multiple of  . Let  be the
indivisible split 1PS of M which is a positive multiple to  . We dene G = fg 2
M j  (g) = 1g. Note that G is connected. The group G acts on Z linearly.
Let Zss be the set of semi-stable points with respect to this action. Let P be the
standard parabolic subgroup of G whose Levi component is M and xes the set
Y . Let U be the unipotent radical of P . Since  is split, all these groups are
split groups over k.
    Let Yssk = p 1(Zssk ). We dene Sk =  1(Sk ) etc. The following inductive
structure of the strata was proved by Kirwan and Ness [10], [13].
Proposition (1.7) Sk = Gk Pk Yssk :
    The fact that this S and S in (1) coincide is proved in [10, pp. 150{156]. More
precisely, suppose that x 2 Sk, and  2 x. Choose g 2 Gk so that gg 1 is a
1PS of Tk proportional to  . Then gx must belong to Ykss.
(3) The convexity property of the moment map
    We assume that k = C . Let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G, and TK a
maximal torus of K . We assume that the action of TK on P(V ) is diagonalized. Let
g; k; t, be the Lie algebras of G; K; TK respectively. Let t be a Weyl chamber. We
choose a K invariant Hermitian product ( ; )V on V . This denes a homomorphism
of Lie algebras k 7! u(N ) (the N dimensional unitary Lie algebra). We consider
the Fubini-Study metric on P(V ) dened by this metric. Let ! be its Kahler form.
If a 2 k, it denes a vector eld on P(V ).
Denition (1.8) A map  : P(V ) 7! k is called a moment map if it satises the
following two conditions
(1)  is K -equivariant with respect to the co-adjoint action of K on k ,
(2) d(x)()(a) = !x(; ax ) for all x 2 P(V );  2 Tx P(V ), and a 2 k.
   If a moment map exists and K is semi-simple, it is uniquely determined by the
above conditions.

   For P(V ), one can construct a moment map in the following manner. Suppose
that x 2 V n f0g, (x) = y 2 P(V ), and a 2 u(N ). We dene a map  : P(V ) !
u(N ) by                                    t
                              (y)(a) = p xax :
                                         2 1(x; x)
Let  be the composition of  and the natural map u(N ) 7! k . This  is a moment
map.
   Let T be the composition of , and the projection k ! t. The third denition
of the stratication is based on the following convexity property of the moment
map (see [1], [7] or, [12] Appendix by Mumford).
Theorem (1.9) Let X  P(V ) be a connected G-invariant closed subvariety. Then
T (X ) \ t is a rational convex polytope.
   For y = (x) 2 P(V ), we consider the closest point of (Gy) \ t to the origin,
which we call x. Let  2 tQ \ t . By the identication t 
                                                            = t , we can consider 
as an element of tQ \ t . We dene S = fx j x =  g. Clearly,
                                                a
                                    V n f0g =       S :
                                                
This denition coincides with previous denitions. Kirwan proved that this strati-
cation is perfect with respect to HG ( ) 
 Q (the equivariant cohomology group)
using this formulation. The isomorphism HG (P(V )) 
 Q       = H  (BG) 
 H  (P(V )) 
 Q
is proved in 5.8 [10] (also see [2]). Also
   HG (S ) 
 Q 
                  = HP (Yss) 
 Q 
                                     = HM  (Zss) 
 Q 
                                                         = H  (BC  ) 
 HG  (Zss) 
 Q:
Therefore, this gives an eective way of computing HG (P(V )ss ) 
 Q. The basic
reason why the stratication is perfect is that by  , C  acts non-trivially on Z by
scalar multiplications, and it induces a multiplication by an element of H  (BC  ) 

HG  (Zss) 
 Q whose rst component is non-zero via the Gysin map (see Theorem
5.4 [10] for the details).
   This is the Morse stratication with respect to the function kk2. However,
critical points are not isolated, so one has to give the direction of the Morse ow,
which is given by  for points in Yss .
   Now we consider the situation in the introduction. Let (G; V; V ) be a preho-
mogeneous vector space over a number eld k. Let G0 = Ker(V ) as before. The
group G0 is connected as we mentioned at the beginning of this section. Let
                                                a
                                   Vk n f0g =       Sk
                                                
be the equivariant Morse stratication with respect to the action of G0 .
Lemma (1.10) Gk = G0k Tk .
Proof. We only have to show that V is indivisible as a character of T also. Since
all the characters of G are rational, we assume that k is algebraically closed. Let
                                            8
C be the connected center, and G = [G; G]. Then G = C G , G is semi-simple and
T = T \ G is a maximal torus of G . Suppose that V = p on T . Since T is
connected, this implies that  is trivial on T also. Since T=T     = C=C \ G   = G=G,
we can extend  to a character of G. Regular elements are dense in G, so V = p.
Therefore, p = 1.
                                                                                     Q.E.D.
   Let M = fg 2 G j Adg ( ) =  g, and M0 = M \ G0 etc. Kempf's theorem
(1.5) and (1.7) imply the following proposition.
Proposition (1.11) Sk = Gk Pk Ykss .
Proof. Let x 2 Sk . Then any  2 x is split. Therefore, we can choose g in the
remark after (1.7) from Gk . So gx 2 Ykss \ Vk = Ykss. Therefore, Gk  Ykss ! Sk
is surjective. Suppose that g1; g2 2 G0k ; t1; t2 2 Tk ; y1; y2 2 Ykss, and g1t1y1 =
g2t2y2 . Then g1(t1 y1 ) = g2(t2 y2). By (1.8), there exists p 2 P0 k such that
g1 = pg2; (t1 y1 ) = p 1 (t2 y2 ). From the rst equation, p 2 Pk  0 . By assumption,
g2pt1 y1 = g2t2y2 . Therefore, y1 = t1 1p 1 t2y2 . Let pe = t2 1 pt1. This pe is an element
of Pk , and satises the condition g1t1 = g2t2pe; y1 = pe 1 y2 .
                                                                                     Q.E.D.
   Equivariant Morse theory in algebraic situation like in this section was estab-
lished around 1983. However, Kempf's paper appeared in Annals in 1978. There-
fore, he proved the rationality of the Morse stratication before equivariant Morse
theory was established.
   Of course, if (G; V; V ) is a prehomogeneous vector space over an algebraically
closed eld, the equivariant Morse stratication is the decomposition into G-orbits.
But how do we determine the orbit decompositions of prehomogeneous vector spaces
systematically? It is easy to observe from the second denition of the stratication
that it is possible to write a computer program to determine all the possible B 3  's.
Moreover, the knowledge of B enables us to determine the inductive structure of
each stratum also.

x2 Examples of Morse stratications
   We consider equivariant Morse stratications for the following examples
   (1) G = GL(1)  GL(2); V = Sym3 k2,
   (2) G = GL(2)  GL(1)2 ; V = Sym2k2  k2,
   (3) G = GL(3)  GL(2); V = Sym2 k3 
 k2.
   The zeta function for the case (1) was studied by Shintani. The case (2) is an
example of a reducible representation and was studied by F. Sato [14]. The case
(3) is the F4 case (or the quartic case) in [23].
   For later purposes, we x some notations. Let
(2:1)              tAn   1   = fq = (q1 ;    ; qn) 2 Rn j q1 +    + qn = 0g:
Let tAn   1C   be the complexication of tAn 1 . For
                         q = (q1 ;    ; qn); q0 = (q10 ;    ; qn0 ) 2 tAn 1 ;
                                                     9
                            P
we dene (q; q0 )An 1 = i qi qi0 . For z = (z1 ;    ; zn ) 2 tAn 1C and a permutation
 , we dene z = (z (1) ;    ; z (n)). This inner product is invariant under permu-
tations. By this inner product, we identify tAn 1 with its dual space. Let k kAn 1
be the metric dened by this inner product.
(1) The case G = GL(1)  GL(2); V = Sym3 k2
    The group GL(2) acts on V naturally, and if  2 GL(1),  acts by multiplication
by . Let Te  G be the kernel of the homomorphism G ! GL(V ). We consider the
character V (t; g) = (det g)2t 3 for (t; g) 2 G. We can consider V as a character
of G=Te, and it is indivisible as a character of G. It is known that (G=Te; V; V ) is a
prehomogeneous vector space. Let G0 be the kernel of V . Then G0 is isomorphic
to SL(2). Therefore, t; t can be identied with tA1 . We choose an identication
R  = t by the map q ! ( q; q). We choose t = fq 2 R j q  0g as the Weyl
chamber. The weighs of coordinates of V are 3; 1; 1; 3. Therefore, there are two
possibilities for  , i.e. 1 = 1; 2 = 3. The stratum S1 is the set of forms with one
double factor. The stratum S2 is the set of forms with one triple factor (see [18],
[22] for the details).
(2) The case G = GL(2)  GL(1)2 ; V = Sym2k2  k2
    The group GL(2) acts on each irreducible component of V naturally. Let g =
(g1; t1 ; t2) and v = (v1; v2 ), where
                   g1 2 GL(2); t1; t2 2 GL(1); v1 2 Sym2k2; v2 2 k2:
   We dene gv = (t1 g1v1; t2 g1v2). Let Te  G be the kernel of the homomorphism
G ! GL(V ). Let V (g) = (det g1)atb11 tb22 be a character of G. The character V
is trivial on Te if and only if 2a 2b1 b2 = 0. Suppose that this condition is
satised and (a; b1 ; b2) is relatively prime. Then V is indivisible as a character
of G. We consider V as a character of G=Te. The kernel of V is isomorphic
to SL(2)  GL(1) by (g1; ) ! (g1; b2 ;  b1 ). We assume that 2b1 > b2 . We
identify t with R2 by the map q = (q1 ; q2) ! (( q1 ; q1 ); b2 q2 ; b1q2 ). We dene
((q1 ; q2 ); (q10 ; q20 )) = 2q1q10 + 141 q2 q20 . We choose f(q1 ; q2 ) 2 R2 j q1  0g as the Weyl
chamber. The weights of the coordinates look as the following picture.

                                                              


                                                       
   We call these points 1;11; 1;12; 1;22; 2;1; 2;2 from the left to the right and from
the top to the bottom. Consider the convex hulls of the following sets
   (1) C1 : f1;22; 2;1g,
   (2) C2 : f1;12; 2;2g,
   (3) C3 : f1;22; 2;2g,
   (4) C4 : f1;11; 1;22g,

                                                                             
   Let i be the closet point to the origin from Ci for i = 1;    ; 6. In this case,
there are precisely 6 unstable strata S1 ;    ; S6 (The vector (0; b1 ) gives the
empty set).
(3) The case G = GL(3)  GL(2); V = Sym2 k3 
 k2
   Let Ve be the space of quadratic forms in three variables v = (v1 ; v2 ; v3). We
identify Ve with k6 as follows
          Qx(v) = x11 v12 + x12 v1v2 + x13v1 v3 + x22 v22 + x23 v2v3 + x33v32
                        ! x = (x11 ; x12 ; x13 ; x22 ; x23 ; x33):
The group G1 = GL(3) acts on Ve in the following way
                                Qg1 x(v) = Qx (vg1);
for g1 2 G1 .
   We identify V with Ve  Ve . Any element of V is of the form
                                   Q = (Qx1 ; Qx2 );
                                          11
where
                      x1 = (x1;11; x1;12 ; x1;13; x1;22 ; x1;23; x1;33 );
                      x2 = (x2;11; x2;12 ; x2;13; x2;22 ; x2;23; x2;33 ):
We use x = (x1 ; x2 ) as the coordinate systemof V . 
  If g = (g1; g2) 2 GL(3)  GL(2) and g2 = ac db , we dene

                       g  Q = (aQg1 x1 + bQg1 x2 ; cQg1 x1 + dQg1 x2 ):
     Let Te be as before. Let V (g1; g2) = (det g1)4 (det g2)3 for g1 2 GL(3); g2 2
GL(2). The character V is tirvial on Te, and we consider V as a character of
G=Te. The character V is indivisible as a character of G.
     First, we x a metric on t. We identify t with tA2  tA1 . For q = (q1; q2 ); q0 =
(q10 q20 ) 2 t , we dene (q; q0 ) = (q1 ; q10 )A2 + (q2 ; q20 )A1 . This inner product is Weyl
group invariant.
     We dene
        t = fq = (q11 ; q12; q13 ; q21; q22 ) 2 t j q11  q12  q13; q21  q22 g:
We use t as the Weyl chamber. The weights of x1;ij ; x2;ij are as follows
               x1;11     ( 43 ; 32 ; 23 ; 21 ; 12 )        x2;11   ( 34 ; 23 ; 32 ; 12 ; 12 )
               x1;12     ( 13 ; 31 ; 23 ; 21 ; 12 )        x2;12   ( 31 ; 13 ; 23 ; 21 ; 21 )
               x1;13     ( 13 ; 32 ; 13 ; 21 ; 12 )        x2;13   ( 31 ; 23 ; 13 ; 21 ; 21 )
               x1;22     ( 23 ; 34 ; 23 ; 21 ; 12 )        x2;22   ( 23 ; 34 ; 32 ; 12 ; 12 )
               x1;23     ( 32 ; 31 ; 13 ; 21 ; 12 )        x2;23   ( 23 ; 31 ; 13 ; 21 ; 21 )
               x1;33     ( 23 ; 23 ; 34 ; 21 ; 12 )        x2;33   ( 23 ; 32 ; 34 ; 12 ; 12 )
   With our metric, the weights of the coordinates look as the following picture.




  We proved in [23] that q 2 Vkss if and only if the zero set of Q1 = Q2 = 0 in P2k
consists of precisely four points. The unstable strata also have geometric meanings.
Tables (2.2) (2.3) are the list of unstable strata in this case (see [26] for the details).

x3 An invariant measure on GL(n)
    Let k be a number eld for the rest of this paper. Let G = GL(n). We choose
an invariant measure on G in this section. We denote the elds of rational, real,
complex numbers by Q; R; C respectively. We denote the ring of rational integers by
Z. The set of positive real numbers is denoted by R+. For any ring R, R is the set
of invertible elements of R. Let k be a number eld. Let M; M1 ; MR ; MC ; Mf be
the set of all the places, all the innite, real, imaginary, nite places of k respectively.
Let A f (resp. A f ) be the restricted product of kv 's (resp. kv's) over v 2 Mf . Let
k1 (resp. k1    ) be the product of kv 's (resp. kv 's) over v 2 M1 . Then A = k1 A f ,
                
A = k1  A f . If x 2 A or A  , we denote the nite (resp. innite) part of x by
xf (resp. x1 ). If V is a vector space over k, we dene VA ; V1 ; Vf similarly. Let
S (VA ); S (V1 ); S (Vf ) be the spaces of Schwartz{Bruhat functions.
    For a place v, kv is the completion at v. If v 2 Mf , ov  kv is, by denition,
the integer ring of kv . The absolute value of kv is denoted by j jv . For x 2 A  ,
we denote the product of jxjv 's over all v 2 Mf (resp. v 2 M1 ) by jxjf (resp.
jxj1). For v 2 Mf , let v be the prime element, and jv jv = qv 1. Note that if v is
imaginary and jxj is the usual absolute value, jxjv = jxj2 .
    Let r1 ; r2 be the numbers of real and imaginary places respectively. Let h; R; e
be the class number, regulator, and the number of units of k respectively. Let k
be the discriminant
                 R       of k. Let Ck = 2r1 (2)r2 hRe 1. We choose a Haar measure dx
on A so that  R   A =k dx = 1. For any nite place v , we choose a Haar measure dxv on
kv so that ov dxv = 1. We use the ordinary Lebesgue measure dxv for v real, and
                                                       Q
dxv ^ dxv for v imaginary. Then dx = jk j 21 v dxv (see [21, pp. 91]).
                                                                       1
    For  2 R+, let  be the idele whose component at v is  [k:Q] if v 2 M1 and 1
if v 2 Mf . Clearly, jj = . We identify R+ with a subgroup of A  by the map
 ! . Let A 1 = fx 2 A  j jxj = 1g. Then A              = A 1 =kR  R+, and A 1 =k is
compact. We choose a Haar measure d t on A so that A 1 =k d t1 = 1. Using
                                                1        1
this measure, we choose a Haar measure d t on A  so that
                        Z                    Z 1Z
                              f (t)d t =                   f (t1 )dd t1;
                         A                  0        A1


where dR  =  1 d. For any nite place v, we choose a Haar measure d tv on kv
so that ov d tv = 1. Let d tv (x) =Qjxjv 1 dx if v is real, and d tv (x) = jxjv 1dx ^ dx
if v is Qimaginary. Then dt = Ck 1 v dtv (see [21, pp. 95]). We x a character
<>= v <>v of A =k.
    Let k (s) be the Dedekind zeta function. As in [21], we dene
                                                     r1              
                  Zk (s) = jkj s2     2s   ( 2s )          (2) s (s) r2 k (s):

   For a character ! of A  =k, we dene (!) = 1 if ! is trivial, and (!) = 0
otherwise. Q
   Let K = v2M Kv , where Kv = O(n) if v is real, and Kv = U (n) if v is
imaginary, and Kv = GL(n; ov ) if v is nite. Let T  G be the set of diagonal
matrices, and N  G the set of lower triangular matrices whose diagonal entries
                                                 16
are 1. Then B = TN is a Borel subgroup of G. We use the notation
                                              0 t1      1
                  t = an (t1 ;    ; tn ) = @ . . . A ;
                                                     tn
                            01               0 1
                  nn(u) = @ . . A ; u = (uij )i>j 2 A 2 ;
                                       .                  n(n 1)

                             u       1
for elements t 2 TA ; nn(u) 2 NA respectively. Let
                      T+ = ft = an (t1;    ; tn ) j t1 ;    ; tn > 0g:
   The group GA has the Iwasawa decomposition GA = KTA NA . So any element
g 2 GA can be written as
            g = k(g)t(g)nn(u(g)); k(g) 2 K; t(g) 2 TA ; nn(u(g)) 2 NA :
Let T 0 = T \ SL(n), and T+0 = T+ \ TR0 . We consider t in x1 for T 0 . We can identify
t with tAn 1 . For s 2 tC , we dene ts; jtjsv in the usual manner. Let  be half
the sum of weights of N , with respect to the conjugation by elements of T . Let
G0A = fg 2 GQA j j det gj = 1g.
   Let du = i>j duij . This R   is an invariant measure on NA . We choose an invariant
measure dk on K so that KQdk = 1. Let d t = dt1    d tn (t = an (t1 ;    ; tn )).
Let db = t 2d tdu (t 2 = i<j jti 1 tj j). We choose an invariant measure on GA
by dg = t 2 dkdtdu. Let cn() = an (;    ; ). Let dg0 be the invariant measure
on G0A such that for any measurable function on f (g) on GA ,
                     Z                   Z 1Z
                           f (g)dg = n                f (cn ()g0 )d dg0;
                      GA                  0     G0A
where d =  1d. We dene invariant measures on Gkv ; Kv ; Bkv ; Nkv ; Tkv
similarly, and denote them by dgv ;Qdkv ; dbv ; duv ; dtv respectively. Then du =
      n(n 1) Q
jk j 4 v duv , and dt = Ck n v dtv .
   Let
(3:1)                       V = Zk (2)    Zk (n) :
                                     n
                                                 Rnk   1

We dene V1 = 1 for convenience. The volume of GL(n)0A = GL(n)k is Vn .

x4 The zeta function
   Let (G; V; V ) be a prehomogeneous vector space. We dene the zeta function
in a general manner.
   Our main interest is a function of the form ZL (; !; s) in the introduction for
irreducible representations, but in order to carry out the induction, we have to
                                               17
consider a slightly more general objects. Let T0; e be as in the introduction. For
any split torus T    = GL(1)r , we dene T+ to be the subset of TA which corresponds
to Rr+ by the above isomorphism. Let T+1 = G1A \ T+ .
   Let ! be a character of G1A =Gk . A principal quasi-character of G1A =Gk is a
function of the form j(g)js where  is a rational character of G and s 2 C . If  is a
principal quasi-character of G1A =Gk , we extend it to GA so that it it trivial
                                                                         Q on T0+.
Let  = (1 ;    ; l) be principal quasi-characters. We dene (g) = i i (g). Let
S (VA ) be the space of Schwartz{Bruhat functions on VA .
   For later purposes, we introduce some notations.
Denition P  (4.1) Let L  Vk be a Gk -invariant subset. For  2 S (VA ), we dene
L (; g) = x2L (gx).
   We use the notation S (; g) instead of Sk (; g) etc.
Denition (4.2) For a Gk -invariant subset L  Vkss and a Schwartz{Bruhat func-
tion  2 S (VA ), we dene
                                    Z
(1)             ZL(; !; ; s) =                !(g)(g)jV (g)j se L (; g)dg;
                                    ZGA=Gk
(2)            ZL+(; !; ; s) =         G =G   k
                                                     !(g)(g)jV (g)j se L (; g)dg:
                                        jVA(g)j1
if these integtrals converges absolutely.
     For x 2 Vk , let G0x be the connected component of 1 of the stabilizer of x. Let
   0
Vk be the set of points x 2 Vk such that G0x does not have a non-trivial rational
character. We expect that the largest Gk -invariant set L for which the integrals
(1), (2) converges absolutely for Re(s)  0 is Vk0 .
     In [16], F. Sato proved this convergence under the condition that if the stabilizer
of x is connected for any x 2 Vkss and Vk0 = Vkss . F. Sato's paper [16] is written
in classical language and the proof in adelic language can be seen in [24]. The
above condition applies to many prehomogeneous vector spaces. However, there
are several very interesting prehomogeneous vector spaces which do not satisfy the
above condition. For those cases, it is useful to use invariant theory as follows.
     If X  (G) is generated by one element, we do not have to consider , and therefore
we write ZL (; !; s) etc.
     We give an alternative denition of the zeta function when the group is of the
form G=Te where G is a product of GL(n)'s, and Te is a split torus contained in the
center of G.
Denition (4.3) For a connected reductive group G, we dene G0A = fg 2 GA j
j(g)j = 1 for all  2 X  (G)g.
     If G = GL(n), GL(n)0A = fg 2 GL(n)A j j det gj = 1g. Suppose that G =
GL(n1 )      GL(nf ). Let ! = (!1 ;    ; !f ) be characters of A  =k . We dene
!(g1;    ; gf ) = !1(det g1)    !f (det gf ). Let # (!) = (!1 )    (!f ). Let ci(i )
be as in x3 for i 2 R+. For  = (1 ;    ; f ) 2 Rf+, let c() = (c1(1 );    ; cf (f )).
Any element of GA is of the form c()g0 where g0 2 G0A . We choose a subgroup
T+  T+1 so that T+   = T+1 =Te+. Let g1 = tg0 where t 2 T; g0 2 G0A . Let G1A = TG     0A
                                                     18
and GeA = R+  G1A . We identify T0+ with R+. We use the measure dg0 on G0A
which is a product of measures we dened in x3. Let d t be a Haar measure on T,
and dg1 = d tdg0. Let eg = (; g1), where  2 R+. We dene deg = ddg1. If we
choose d t suitably, ZL (; !; ; s) is equal to the following integral
                            Z
(4:4)                                  s !(g1)(g1)L (; ge)deg:
                             GeA =Gk
ZL+(; !; ; s) has a similar expression also. In particular, if X  (G=Te) is generated
by one element, G1A = G0A and T+ is trivial. Therefore, in this case, we use the
measure on G0A which we dened in x3. Also we do not have to consider . We
used this kind of formulation in [26].
   We say that (G; V; V ) is of complete type if for any , there exists a constant
() such that ZVkss (; !; ; s) converges absolutely and locally uniformly for all
!; , and Re(s) > (). Otherwise we say it is of incomplete type. If (G; V; V ) is
of complete type, we write ZV (; !; ; s) or simply Z (; !; ; s) for ZVkss (; !; ; s)
etc.
   Let G0 be as in x1, and T 0 = T \ G0 . Let t = X (T 0 ) 
 R etc. We choose a
coordinate system x = (x1 ;    ; xN ) whose coordinate vectors are eigenvectors of
T . Let i 2 t be the weights of xi . For x 2 Vk n f0g, we dene Ix = fi j xi 6= 0g.
Let Cx be the convex hull of the set fi j i 2 Ixg.
Denition (4.5) A point x 2 Vk n f0g is called k-stable if for any g 2 Gk , Cgx
contains a neighborhood of the origin.
   We denote the set of k-stable points by Vks.
   We proved in [26] that ZL (; !; ; s) is well dened for L = Vks if Re(s) is
suciently large, and ZL+(; !; ; s) is an entire function. For the cases where F.
Sato's criterion of convergence of the zeta function does not apply, the set Vks seems
to coincide with Vk0 . Therefore, except for a few cases, we know the convergence of
the zeta function.
   Let G = GL(n1 )      GL(nf ), and (G; V ) be a prehomogeneous vector space.
For g = (g1;    ; gf ), we dene t g = (t g1;    ; t gf ). Let G the longest element of
the Weyl group of G. Let V  be the dual space of V . The action f (x) ! f (g 1 x)
for f 2 V  denes a representation of G on V  . The action x ! tg 1x is a
representation of G on V and the weights of this representation and the weights of
the representation V  are the same. Therefore, these representations are equivalent.
So there exists a bilinear form [x; y]0V on V such that [gx; y]0V = [x; t gy]0V . We
dene [x; y]V = [x; Gy]0V and g = Gtg 1G 1. Then [gx; y]V = [x; (g ) 1 y]V for
all x; y 2 V and g is an involution of G.
   We dene a Fourier transform b of  2 S (VA ) by the formula
                                       Z
(4:6)                       b (x) =          (y) < [x; y]V > dy:
                                         VA
   The determinant of GL(V ) denes a rational character of G which we call V .
Let V be the principal quasi-character of GA =Gk which is jV (g1)j 1 for g1 2 G1A ,
and is trivial on T0+. For a Gk -invariant subset L  VA , we dene
                                         X b            X
(4:7)            JL(; ge) =  N V (eg)      (eg x)         (egx)
                                              x2Vk nL         x2VknL
                                                 19
for eg = (; g1). If L = Vkss, we drop L, and simply write J (; g). For  2 S (VA )
and  2 R+, we dene (x) = (x). By the Poisson summation formula,
(4:8)       ZL (; !; ; s) = ZL+(; !; ; s) + ZL+(b ; ! 1 ; V 1 1 ; N s)
                                 Z 1Z
                             +                  JL (; g   1 )d dg 1 :
                                  0     G1A =Gk
  For later purposes, we dene an operator MV;! on S (VA ) for a character ! on
GeA =Gk .          R standard maximal compact subgroup K . We x a Haar
         Consider the
measure dk so that K dk = 1.
Denition (4.9) Let ; ! be as above. We dene
                                           Z
                           MV;! (x) =           !(det k)(kx)dk:
                                             K
   If ! is trivial, this is the operator to average over K .

x5 The smoothed Eisenstein series
   Let G be a connected reductive group not necessarily split over a number eld k.
We x a minimal parabolic subgroup P  G. Let T  G be a maximal split torus
contained in P . Let  be half the sum of positive weights. Let d be the dimension
of T+0 . Let t0 be the Lie algebra of T+0 , and t0C = t0 
 C . Let EP (g; z) be the
Eisenstein series of G with respect to P where g 2 G0A , and z 2 t0C.
   We x a Weyl group invariant Hermitian product ( ; )0 on t0C. Let k k0 be the
norm dened by this product. Let L(z) = (z; )0 , and w0 = L(). We choose an
entire function (z) on t0C which is rapidly decreasing on any vertical strip.
Denition (5.1) We dene a function E (g; w; ) on G0A =Gk  C by the following
contour integral
                             1 d Z                 EP (g; z) (z) dz;
               E (g; w; ) =      p
                              2 1         Re(w)>L(q) w L(z )
                                             Re(z)=q

where we choose q so that EP (g; z) converges absolutely for Re(z) = q.
    We call E (g; w; ) a smoothed Eisenstein series. If there is no confusion, we drop
  , and write E (g; w) also.
    Let 1;    ; d 2 t0 be simple roots. We x a small positive number . Let K
be a special maximal compact subgroup of GA , so GA = KPA . The group K is
contained in G0A . Let T0 = ft 2 T+0 j ti   for all ig. We can choose a compact
set 
  PA so that KT0
 surjects to G0A =Gk . We can also choose a compact set

b  G0A so thatPfktnt 1 j k 2 K; t 2 T0; n 2

    Let t0+ = f i ai i j a1;    ; ad > 0g. If r1; r2 2 t0, then we use the notation
r1 > r2 if r1 r2 2 t0+ . Let r 2 t0 . Let C (G0A =Gk ) be the set of continuous
functions on G0A =Gk . We dene

   If the statement of (5.3) is true for a group G, we call it Shintani's lemma for
G, because we are generalizing Lemma 2.9 [18]. The author proved the following
theorem in [26].
Theorem (5.4) The conjecture (5.3) is true if G is a product of GL(n)'s.
   If G = GL(n), the constant CG is Vn 1 . The proof of this theorem is fairly
technical and involves estimates of Whittaker functions. We briey explain why we
have to use the linear function L(z) by the case of GL(n). We consider the Borel
subgroup B.
   In this case, the Weyl group is the set of permutations of the set f1;    ; ng. For
a permutation  , we dene
                                   Y Zk (z (i) z (i) )
                       M  (z ) =        Zk (z (i) z (i) + 1) :
                                   i>j

  The constant term of EB (g; z) is equal to  M (z)tz+ . Let
                                               n 1 Z                M (z)tz+ (z) dz;
             E (g; w;   )=            p1                                w L(z )

                                                         Re(w)>L(q)

where we use the same q as in (5.1).
    Note that if  is an element of the Weyl group,  p      (  1 ;  1)0 = (; )0.
                  1
Therefore,   lies on the sphere of radius (; )0 . It is easy to see that
    1 =  if and only if  is the longest element of the Weyl group. Therefore,
L(  1) < L() unless  is the longest element. If z =  1, then z (i)
z (i)  1 for all (i; j ) such that i > j;  (i) <  (j ). Therefore, we can choose q
in a neighborhood of  1 so that z (i) z (j) > 1 for all such pairs. Then
jE (g; w; )j  tq+. The value kq + k0 can be arbitrarily small and L(q) < w0,
if  is not the longest element. This consideration is enough for (1) when  is not
the longest element. If  is the longest element, we consider the residue of M (z)
along z1 z2 = 1 then along z2 z3 and we continue this process. Since the eventual
residue is the constant function Vn 1 as a function of g, we get (1). This argument
for constant terms is fairly easy and is seen in Langlands' work [11]. However, in
[26], we spent most of our labor to the estimates of the non-constant terms. The
statement (2) is slightly trickier, and the reader should see [26] for the details of
the proof of Theorem (5.4).

x6 Adjusting terms
    In this section, we illustrate the necessity of adjusting terms by the example of
the space of binary quadratic forms. Let G = GL(1)  GL(2); V = Sym2k2. Let
Te  G be the kernel of the homomorphism G ! GL(V ). Let V (t; g) = t det g for
(t; g) 2 G. Then V is a rational character of G=Te and is indivisible as a character
of G. In this case, Vks is the set of forms without rational factors.
    Let ! be as in x3. We do not have to consider  in (4.1). We use the alternative
denition (4.3) of the zeta function for L = Vks i.e.,
                                  Z
(6:1)         ZV (; !; s) =                      s!(g0)Vks (; g0)d dg0 etc.

   If 	 = 
	v , then TV (	; !; s; s1 ) = jk j 12 Ck 1 v Tv (	v ; !; s; s1 ). Suppose that
	v is the characteristic function of o2v , and ! is trivial. Then easy computations
(see (2.10) [25]) show that

                                          (1 qv s)(1 qv (s+s1 1))
   In general, Tv (	v ; !; s; s1 ) can be continued meromorphically everywhere, and
is holomorphic for Re(s) + Re(s1 ) > 1; Re(s) > 0. Therefore, TV (	; !; s; s1 ) can be
continued meromorphically everywhere, and is holomorphic for Re(s) + Re(s1 ) >
2; Re(s) > 1. Also the integrals dening TV +(	; !; s; s1 ); TV1 (	; !; s1 ) converge
absolutely and locally uniformly1 for all s; s1 . We call ZV;ad(; !; s) the adjusted
zeta function for V , and (!12!2 ) TV (ReV;0MV;! ; !1 ; s) the adjusting term.
   ZV;ad(; !; s) has nitely many poles and satises a functional equation
                        ZV;ad(; !; s) = ZV;ad(b ; ! 1 ; 3 s):
We will state the principal part of ZV;ad(; !; s) in x8. Also the author proved that
generalized special values of ZV;ad(; !; s) contribute to the poles of zeta functions
in [26].
   First we briey explain how the adjusting term arises. Let HV be the subgroup
of G generated by T and the element (1; GL(2)).
Proposition (6.5) Let
                                                                                  q

                                                        23
Then for any measurable function f (g) on G0A =HV k ,
                               Z                                   Z
                                               f (g)dg =                     f (g)dg;
                                   G0A =HV k                       XHV =Tk
if the right hand side converges absolutely.
     Let Z 0ss0 be the set of points of the form (0; x1 ; 0) such that x1 6= 0. Then
Gk Z 0ss0;k = Gk HV k Z 0 ss0;k . The reason why we need the adjusting term in this case
is that we have to consider the fundamenental domain XHV for the group HV in
order to handle the set Vkss n Vks.
     Suppose that (G; V; V ) is a prehomogeneous vector space of incomplete type.
Then if L is the maximal subset such that (4.1) converges absolutely and locally
uniformly for Re(s)  0 (assuming such L exists), the author expects that Vkss n L
decomposes into nite Gk -invariant subsets Sst;1;    ; Sst;iV where Sst;i = Gk HV;ik
Z 0;ik , HV;i  G is a (not necessarily connected) reductive subgroup of G, Z00 ;i  V
  0 ss
is an HV;i -invariant subspace, and Z 0ss0;ik is the set of semi-stable points with respect
to HV;i \ G0 for all i. Let HV;i    0 be the connected component of HV;i which contains
the unit element. Suppose that for each i, there exist functions V;i1;    ; V;ijV;i
and that if
               XHV;i = fg1 2 G1A j V;i1(g1)  1;    ; V;ijV;i (g1)  1g;
                                                   0 , and
then XHV;i is invariant under the right action of HV;ik

    In the case V = Sym2 k2, our adjusting term appeared in this way. Also we
proved in [25] that TV +(	; !; s) is an entire function, and TV (	; !; s) is holomor-
phic for Re(s) > 2. Therefore, TV (	; !; s) does not eect the right most pole.
The author expects similar properties for the general adjusting terms (see [26] for
example).

x7 The general program
   In this section, we describe our program to compute the principal parts of zeta
functions for prehomogeneous vector spaces when G is a product of GL(n)'s.
Denition (7.1) Let f1 (w); f2 (w) be meromorphic functions on a domain of the
form fw 2 C j Re(w) > Ag. We use the notation f1  f2 if the following two
conditions are satised.
(1) There exists a constant A0 < w0 such that f1 f2 can be continued meromor-
phically to the domain fw 2 C j Re(w) > A0 g.
(2) f1 (w) f2(w) is holomorphic around w = w0.

We expect that the rst four terms to be entire and that the adjusting terms are
holomorphic at s = max pi().
   The author carried out this program for Sym2kn and Sym2k3 
 k2. We describe
our results in x8. Consider the second case. The stratum S8 in x2 corresponds
to the representation (2) in x2. The zeta function for this case was handled by F.
Sato (see [14]) in a slightly dierent formulation. The author handled two more
reducible prehomogeneous vector spaces which correspond to 6; 8 in x2 from our
viewpoint. These are reducible representations with two irreducible components.
The reader should see [26] for the details of these cases. In the future, we have to
generalize the method so that we can handle representations with more than two
irreducible factors.
   For the rest of this section, we briey discuss how we proceed, and point out
technical diculties. We consider an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space of
complete type (G; V; V ) for simplicity. So G1A = G0A , and we do not have to
consider .
   By the Morse stratication,
                               X                                     
              J (; g1) =           S (b ; (g1 )) S (; g1) + b (0) (0):
                               
                                                   26
(V (g1) = 1.)
   Therefore,
                     Z
                                  !(g1)J (; g1)E (g1; w; )dg1
                      G1A =Gk
                         XZ
                     =                      !(g1)S (b ; (g1 ))E (g1; w; )dg1
                                 G1A =Gk
                          XZ
                                              !(g1)S (; g1 )E (g1; w; )dg1
                                   G1A =Gk

                     + w (w) (b (0) (0)):
                               0
In this way, we can at least start considering the contributions from unstable strata
indirectly by the use of the smoothed Eisenstein series. Let
                                      Z
                  (; !; w) =                   !(g1)S (; g1 )E (g1 ; w; )dg1:
                                        G1A =Gk
   First, it can happen that  (; !; w)  0 for some strata  . For Sym2k3 
 k2,
this is the case for  = 2 ; 3 ; 5. Therefore, not all the strata contribute to the
poles, and these strata have to be removed.
   If  = MV;! ,
                 Z
 (; !; w) =                !(g1 )Yss (; g1 n (u ))E (g1 n (u ); w; )(g1 )   2 dg 1 du ;
                                                                                                
                  P1A =Pk
where P1A = PA \ G1A ,  is half the sum of positive weights of P , and dg1 ; du
are invariant measures on MA \ G1A ; UA . We want to compare this integral
with the integration on MA \ G1A =Mk by considering the constant terms of both
Yss (; g1 n (u )), and E (g1 n (u ); w; ) with respect to U . Then the result-
ing integral resembles the zeta function for (M ; Z ) except it still has the Eisen-
stein series in the integrand. However, the estimate of the non-constant terms is
a formidable task. In the case Sym2k3 
 k2, this was done by considering further
stratications of the representations Z using the notion of  -sequences ([10, pp.
73]).
   Also it is too optimistic to expect that for all  ,
                Z
                          ! ( g 1 )S (; g 1 )E (g 1 ; w; )dg 1  () a (; ! )
                  G1A =Gk
                                     
                                                                  w w0
for some a (; !), satisfying a similar property as in (7.2) (2). This is because there
are interactions (both constant terms and non-constant terms) between strata. For
example, for Sym2k3 
 k2, some cancellations have to be established between the
strata S6 ; S8 ; S9 . Those cancellations can be established only if we consider the
further Morse stratications of the representations Z8 etc. The reader should see
[26] for the details.

x8 Examples of principal part formulas
   In this section, we consider some examples of prehomogeneous vector spaces for
which the principal parts of the poles of the zeta function were determined. In
order to state them, we have to introduce some notation.
   Let  2 S (VA ), and S = G P Yss be a stratum. We dene R  2 S (ZA )
by the formula                        Z
                           R (x) =           (x; y)dy
                                           WA =Wk
                                                                   R
for x 2 ZA , where dy is the measure on WA such that WA =Wk dy = 1.
   Let 	 2 S (A i ). Let !1 ;    ; !i be characters
                                                Q      of A  =k, and ! = (!1;    ; !i ).
For t = (t1 ;    ; ti ) 2 A , we dene
                              i
                                     P    !(t) = j !j (tj ). We consider ! as a character
        
of (A =k ) . Let i(	; t) = x2(k)i 	(tx). For s = (s1 ;    ; si ) 2 C i , and t as
              i
above, we dene jtjs in an obvious manner.
Denition (8.1)
                                      Z
                      i(	; !; s) =                  jtjs!(t)i(	; t)d t:
                                       (A  =k )i

   If ! is trivial, we drop !, and use the notation i (	; s).
Denition (8.2) For j = (j1;    ; ji ) 2 Zi; s0 = (Qs0;1 ;    ; s0;i ) 2 C i , we use
the notation i;(j1 ; ;ji )(	; !; s0 ) for the coecient of l (sl s0;l)jl in the Laurent
expansion of i (	; !; s) at s = s0 . We also drop ! in this notation when ! is
trivial.
   If i(	; !; s) is holomorphic at s = s0, i;(0; ;0)(	; !; s0 ) = i(	; !; s0 ).
(1) The case G = GL(1)  GL(2); V = Sym3 k2
   We consider the situation in the second example in x2. We dene the zeta
function by (4.4) (see the remark after (4.4)) for L = Vkss. The following theorem
was proved by Shintani [18], and the adelic version can be found in [22].
Theorem (8.3) Suppose that  = MV;! . Then
                                                                                        !

(2) The case G = GL(1)  GL(2); V = Sym2 k2
   In this case, there is precisely one unstable stratum S1 , where 1 = 2 using
a similar identication R = t as in x2 (1). The following theorem was proved by
Shintani [19], and the adelic version can be found in [25].

(3) The case G = GL(1)  GL(n); V = Sym2 kn
   The case n = 2 is the previous case. Let Te be as before, and we consider
(G=T;e V ). If n  3, it is of complete type and X  (G=Te) is generated by one
element. So we consider the situation in (4.4). We dene

   Let Si be the set of rank n i forms. Then S1 ;    ; Sn 1 are unstable strata.

Theorem (8.5) Let n  3. Suppose that MVn;!  = . Then
                ZVn (; !; s) = ZVn+(; !; s) + ZVn+(b ; ! 1 ; n(n2+ 1) s)
                                  Fn(b ; ! 1; n(n2+ 1) s) Fn (; !; s):

   Suppose that  = 
v v , and v has a compact support contained in Vkssv for a
place v 2 M1. Then it turns out that 1(R0n 2;0; n 1) = 1 (R0n 2;0b ; n 1) =
0. Therefore, the poles of the associated Dirichlet series are all simple.
(4) The case G = GL(3)  GL(2); V = Sym2 k3 
 k2
   This is the third example in x2. Let ! = (!1; !2 ) be as before. In order to handle
the zeta function in this case, we need to know the pole structures of zeta func-
tions for unstable strata. The strata S2 ; S3 ; S5 do not contribute to the poles.
The stratum S1 corresponds to V3 in (3). Let 1 (	; !0 ; s) = ZV3 (	; !0 ; s) for
	 2 S (Z1A ), !0 a character of A 1 =k  GL(3)0 = GL(2)k , and s 2 C . The distri-
bution 1 (	; !0 ; s) is holomorphic at s = 2. The stratum S4 corresponds to the
prehomogeneous vector space GL(2)  GL(2)=Te; V = k2 
 k2, where Te is as before.
We dene 4 (	; !0 ; s) by (4.4). The distribution 4 (	; !0 ; s) is holomorphic at
s = 2. The strata S6 ; S8 correspond to GL(2)  GL(1)2 =Te; V = Sym2k2  k or
Sym2 k2 k2 where GL(2) acts on k trivially, and the action of GL(1)2 is similar as in
x2. A similar argument as in x2 holds for S6 also. We choose (b1 ; b2 ) = (3; 5); (3; 4)
for S6 ; S8 respectively. Let a6 (1) = (1; 51; 1 3 ); a8 (1 ) = (1; 41 ; 1 3) for
1 2 R+. Then we can choose T = fa6 (1 ) j 1 2 R+g or fa8 (1 ) j 1 2 R+g.
We use d1 on T. Let 6 ; 8 be principal quasi-characters of G1A =Gk satisfy-
ing 6 (a6 (1 )) = 1 1; 8 (a8 (1 )) = 21. We dene 8 (	; !0 ; 8 ; s) by (4.4).
This case was handled by F. Sato in a slightly dierent formulation [14]. Note
that !0 = (!10 ; !20 ; !30 ) is a character on GL(2)0 = GL(2)k  (A  =k)2 . The case
Sym2 k2  k is of incomplete type, and let 6;ad(	; !0 ; 6 ; s) be the adjusted zeta
function (see [26] for the details). The distribution 6 (	; !0 ; 6 ; s) is holomor-
phic at s = 3, but 8 (	; !0 ; 8 ; s) has a possible simple pole at s = 3. We
choose (x1;33 ; x2;13; x2;22 ) (resp. (x1;23 ; x2;13; x2;22 )) as the coordinate of Z7 (resp.
Z9 ). The stratum S10 corresponds to GL(2)  GL(2)=T;             e V = Sym2k2 
 k2. We
                   0
dene 10 (	; ! ; s) by (4.4). This case is of incomplete type, and requires an ad-
justing term. Let 10;ad(	; !0 ; s) be the adjusted zeta function. The distribution
10;ad(	; !0 ; s) is holomorphic at s = 3. Let Z0 6;0 (resp. Z0 10;0) be the set of
points x's such that xi;jk = 0 except for x1;33 ; x2;12 (resp. x1;33 ; x2;22). We dene
                                      Z
      R0  6 ;0 (x1;33 ; x2;12 ) =       R6 (x1;33 ; 0; x2;12 ; x2;22)dx2;22 ;
                                      Z
                                      A

     R010 ;0 (x1;33 ; x2;22 ) =          R10 (0; 0; x1;33 ; x2;22; x2;23 ; x2;33)dx2;23 dx2;33:
                                      A2

   We need some denitions in order to state the result in this case.

  We proved the following theorem in [26].
Theorem (8.7) Suppose that MV;!  = . Then
 Z (; !; s) = Z+ (; !; s) + Z+(b ; ! 1; 12 s) F (b ; ! 1 ; 12 s) F (; !; s):
  Most of the coecients of the Laurent expansions at the poles of Z (; !; s) are
generalized special values of the adjusted zeta functions dened for Z 's. However,
we have some extra terms like 2;(1;0)(R06;0; 1; 3). The author expects similar
phenomena for other prehomogeneous vector spaces. Also the author hopes to
handle more cases in the near future.
