                                                                                 Introduction
                                                 Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field
                                             k. Let Z be the algebraic variety consisting of all triples (P, P ′ , UP ′ gUP ) where
                                             P, P ′ run through some fixed conjugacy classes of parabolics in G and g is an
                                             element of G that conjugates P to a parabolic in a fixed ”good” relative position
                                             y with P ′ (here UP , UP ′ are the unipotent radicals of P, P ′ ). The varieties Z
                                             include more or less as a special case the boundary pieces of the De Concini-
                                             Procesi completion Ḡ of G (assumed to be adjoint). They also include as a special
                                             case the varieties studied in the first part of this series [L9] (where y = 1 that
                                             is, gP g −1 = P ′ ). In this special case a theory of ”character sheaves” on Z was
                                             developed in [L9]. In the present paper we extend the theory of character sheaves
                                             to a general Z.
                                                 We now review the content of this paper in more detail. (The numbering of
                                             sections continues that of [L9]; we also follow the notation of [L9] .)
                                                 In Section 8 we introduce a partition of Z similar to that in [L9]; as in [L9], it
                                             is based on the combinatorics in Section 2. But whereas in [L9] the combinatorics
                                             needed is covered by the results in [B], for the present paper we actually need
                                             the slight generalization of [B] given in Section 2. Now, it is not obvious that the
                                             partition of Z defined in Section 8 reduces for y = 1 to that in Section 3; this needs
                                             an argument that is given in Section 9. In Section 10 we consider the example
                                             where G is a general linear group. In Section 11 we define the ”parabolic character
                                             sheaves” on Z. As in the case y = 1 (Section 4), we give two definitions for
                                             these; one uses the partition in Section 8 and allows us to enumerate the parabolic
                                             character sheaves; the other one imitates the definition of character sheaves in [L3].
                                             (The two definitions are equivalent by 11.15 and 11.18.) The theory of character
                                             sheaves in Section 11 generalizes that in Section 4 (this is seen from the second
                                             definition). A consequence of the coincidence of the two definitions of parabolic
                                             character sheaves on Z is that a statement like 0.1(a) (concerning characteristic
                                             functions over a finite field) continues to hold in the generality of this paper. In

Section 12 we define the notion of character sheaf on the completion Ḡ. We again
have two definitions; one is based on the partition in Section 8, and the second
one is reminiscent of the definition of character sheaves in [L3]. We expect that
these two definitions coincide, but we cannot prove this; if this was true, we would
have an analogue of 0.1(a) for Ḡ over a finite field. Our results also provide a
finite partition of Ḡ into G-stable pieces (a refinement of the usual partition of
Ḡ into G × G-orbits) which allows us to give an explicit description of the set of
G-conjugacy classes in Ḡ (see 12.3(a)).

8.1. We preserve the setup of 3.1. (Thus, Ĝ is a possibly disconnected reductive
algebraic group over k with identity component G and G1 is a fixed connected
                                                                     ∼
component of Ĝ. Also W, I is the Weyl group of G and δ : W −→ W .) Let
P ∈ PJ , Q ∈ PK , u = pos(P, Q). We have
(a)                  dim((UP ∩ UQ )\UP ) = l(u) + νJ − νJ∩Ad(u)K .
Here νJ is the number of reflections in WJ .
8.2. Let P, P ′ be two parabolics of G. The following hold.
           ′                                                       ′
   (a) P P , P ′P are in good position and pos(P, P ′ ) = pos(P P , P ′P );
                           ′
   (b) if B ∈ B, B ⊂ P P then for some B ′ ∈ B, B ′ ⊂ P ′ we have pos(B, B ′ ) =
pos(P, P ′ ).
                                          ′
To prove (b) we may replace P, P ′ by P P , P ′P . It suffices to prove: if P, P ′ are in
good position and B ⊂ P , then for some B ′ ⊂ P ′ we have pos(B, B ′ ) = pos(P, P ′ ).
8.3. If P, Q are parabolics in good position, we have a bijection
                                              ∼
             {parabolics contained in P } −→ {parabolics contained in Q}
                                 ′            ′
given by P ′ ↔ Q′ , Q′ = QP , P ′ = P Q . (Then P ′ , Q′ are in good position and
pos(P ′ , Q′ ) = pos(P, Q).)
Lemma 8.4. Let P, Q, R be parabolics with a common Levi L.                            Then
pos(P, Q)pos(Q, R) = pos(P, R).
   Let β be a Borel of L. Then B = UP β, B ′ = UQ β, B ′′ = UR β are Borels of
P, Q, R respectively and we have
      pos(P, Q) = pos(B, B ′ ), pos(Q, R) = pos(B ′ , B ′′ ), pos(P, R) = pos(B, B ′′ ).
It suffices to show that pos(B, B ′ )pos(B ′ , B ′′ ) = pos(B, B ′′ ). This holds since
B, B ′ , B ′′ contain β hence have a common maximal torus.

Lemma 8.5. Let P, Q, R be parabolics with a common Levi L; let P ′ , Q′ , R′
be parabolics with a common Levi L′ . Assume that pos(P, Q) = pos(P ′ , Q′ ),
pos(Q, R) = pos(Q′ , R′ ). Assume also that P, P ′ have the same type; Q, Q′ have
the same type; R, R′ have the same type. Then there exists x ∈ G that conjugates
P, Q, R to P ′ , Q′ , R′ .
   Clearly, we can assume that P = P ′ , Q = Q′ , L = L′ . Then we use the following
fact: if Q, R, R′ are parabolics with a common Levi L such that pos(Q, R) =
pos(Q, R′ ) then R = R′ . (This can be reduced to the case where Q, R, R′ are
Borels, which is clear.)
Lemma 8.6. Let Q, Q′ be parabolics with a common Levi. Then Q ∩ UQ′ =
UQ ∩ UQ ′ .
   It suffices to show that Lie Q ∩Lie UQ′ = Lie UQ ∩Lie UQ′ . Let L be a common
Levi of Q, Q′ . Consider the weight decomposition Lie G = ⊕α Lie Gα with respect
to the connected centre of L. Then Lie G0 = Lie L and Lie UQ , Lie UQ′ are direct
sums of various Lie Gα with α 6= 0. Let x ∈ Lie Q ∩ Lie UQ′ . We have x = x0 + x′
with x0 ∈ Lie L′ and x′ ∈ Lie UQ is in ⊕α6=0 Lie Gα . Since x ∈ Lie UQ′ , we
have x ∈ ⊕α6=0 Lie Gα . Hence x0 = 0 and x ∈ Lie UQ . Thus, Lie Q ∩ Lie UQ′ ⊂
Lie UQ ∩ Lie UQ′ . The reverse inclusion is obvious.
Lemma 8.7. Let P, P ′ , Q be parabolics such that pos(P ′ , P ) = z. Assume that
pos(P ′ , Q) = y, that P ′ , Q are in good position and that Q contains a Levi of
                        ′P
P ∩ P ′ . Let Q′ = Q(P ) . Then
               ′
  (a) pos(P P , P ′P ) = z −1 .
  (b) pos(P ′P , Q′ ) = y.
               ′                     ′
  (c) pos(P P , Q′ ) = z −1 y and P P , Q′ are in good position.
   (a) follows from 8.2; (b) follows from 8.3. We prove (c). Let L0 be a common
            ′                                      ′
Levi of P P , P ′P that is contained in Q. Then P P , P ′P , Q′ have a common Levi
                                      ′              ′
L0 . By Lemma 8.4 we have pos(P P , Q′ ) = pos(P P , P ′P )pos(P ′P , Q′ ) = z −1 y as
required.
                                                                             J′
8.8. Let J, J ′ ⊂ I and y ∈ W be such that Ad(y)δ(J) = J ′ , y ∈                  W δ(J) . For
P, P ′ in PJ , PJ ′ let
   Ay (P, P ′ ) = {g ∈ G1 ; pos(P ′ , g P ) = y},
   A′y (P, P ′ ) = {g ∈ Ay (P, P ′ ); g P contains some Levi of P ∩ P ′ }.
Lemma 8.9. (a) Ay (P, P ′ ) is a single P ′ , P double coset and also a single P ′ , UP
double coset.
  (b) Ay (P, P ′ ) = UP ′ A′y (P, P ′ ).
  (c) A′y (P, P ′ ) is a single (P ∩ P ′ ), P double coset and also a single UP ∩P ′ , P
double coset.
  We prove (a). We can find Q ∈ Pδ(J) such that pos(P ′ , Q) = y; moreover, we
can find g ∈ G1 such that g P = Q. Thus Ay (P, P ′ ) 6= ∅. Let g, g ′ ∈ Ay (P, P ′ ).

Clearly, g ′ = xgp with x ∈ P ′ , p ∈ P . Now g P, P ′ are in good position; let L be
                                    −1                                  −1
a common Levi of them. Since g L is a Levi of P , we have p ∈ g LUP . Thus
p = g −1 lgu with l ∈ L, u ∈ UP and g ′ = xgp = xlgu ∈ P ′ gUP .
   We prove (b). Let g ∈ Ay (P, P ′ ). Let L0 be a Levi of P ∩ P ′ . Then L0 is
contained in a Levi L1 of P ′ . Let L2 be a common Levi of P ′ , g P . Then L1 = u L2
for some u ∈ UP ′ . We have ug P = u (g P ) ⊃ u L2 = L1 ⊃ L0 hence ug ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ).
   We prove (c). Let g, g ′ ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ). Then
      ′              ′P
    P P , P ′P , (g P )(P ) have a common Levi;
       ′            ′      ′P
    P P , P ′P , (g P )(P ) have a common Levi;
                         ′P                  ′     ′P
    pos(P ′P , (g P )(P ) ) = pos(P ′P , (g P )(P ) ) = y.
By Lemma 8.5, there exists x ∈ G which conjugates
       ′                  ′P      ′            ′    ′P
    P P , P ′P , (g P )(P ) to P P , P ′P , (g P )(P ) .
                  ′                                           ′               ′
Then x ∈ P P ∩ P ′P = P ∩ P ′ and x conjugates g P to g P , since g P to g P are
                                                   ′P    ′ ′P
parabolics of type δ(J) containing (g P )(P ) , (g P )(P ) . Hence xg ∈ g ′ P that is
g ′ ∈ xgP . Let M be a Levi of P ∩ P ′ with M ⊂ g P . We can write x = vm with
v ∈ UP ∩P ′ , m ∈ M . Then g −1 mg ∈ P , xgP = vmgP = vgg −1 mgP = vgP . The
lemma is proved.
8.10. Let P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ PJ ′ be such that pos(P ′ , P ) = z. Let

                 J1 = J ∩ δ −1 Ad(y −1 z)J, J1′ = J ∩ Ad(z −1 y)δ(J).

Then Ad(z −1 y)δ(J1 ) = J1′ . Let g ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ). We set

                                 ′P                     ′
            P1 = g −1 (g P )(P        )
                                          g,   P1′ = P P ,   (P1 , P1′ ) = α(P, P ′ , g).

We have P1 ⊂ P, P1′ ⊂ P and, by Lemma 8.7, P1′ , g P1 are in good position,

                     P1 ∈ PJ1 , P1′ ∈ PJ1′ ,          pos(P1′ , g P1 ) = z −1 y.

                                                                                            J1′
(We have also pos(P1′ , P ′P ) = z −1 , pos(P ′P , g P1 ) = y). Thus, z −1 y ∈                    W δ(J1 )
and g ∈ Az −1 y (P1 , P1′ ).
Lemma 8.11. Let g, g ′ ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ), u′ ∈ UP ′ , u ∈ UP with g ′ = u′ gu. Then
  (a) g ′ = u′1 gu1 with u′1 ∈ UP1′ , u1 ∈ UP1 ;
  (b) we have α(P, P ′ , g ′ ) = (P1 , P1′ ).
    We prove (a). Since P1 ⊂ P we have UP ⊂ UP1 . Hence we may assume
that u = 1. By Lemma 8.9(c) we have g ′ = vgp with v ∈ UP ∩P ′ , p ∈ P . Thus
g ′ = vgp = u′ g. Hence v −1 u′ = gpg −1 . Now v −1 u′ ∈ UP ∩P ′ UP ′ ⊂ UP ′ P . Thus
v −1 u′ ∈ UP ′P ∩ g P . We have

                      UP ′ P ∩ g P = UP ′P ∩ g P1 = UP ′P ∩ Ug P1 .

                                                                                          ′
(In general, if R, S are parabolics in good position and R′ ⊂ R, S ′ = S R , then
UR′ ∩ S = UR′ ∩ S ′ . Indeed, S ′ = (R′ ∩ S)US hence UR′ ∩ S ⊂ S ′ . Since
R′ , S ′ are in good position, we have UR′ ∩ S ′ = UR′ ∩ US ′ by Lemma 8.6.) Thus,
gpg −1 = v −1 u′ ∈ Ug P1 so that p ∈ UP1 . Now v ∈ UP ∩P ′ ⊂ UP P ′ = UP1′ . We see
that g ′ = vgp with v ∈ UP1′ , p ∈ UP1 . This proves (a).
    We prove (b). We must show that
                                    ′           ′P                          ′P

                                                     u gu = g −1 (g P )(P        )
                                                                                     g

or that u−1 g −1 (g P )(P ) gu = g −1 (g P )(P ) g. This holds since g −1 (g P )(P            )
                                                                                                  g is a
parabolic subgroup of P hence it contains u.
Lemma 8.12. Let g, g ′ ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ). Assume that α(P, P ′ , g) = α(P, P ′ , g ′ ) =
(P1 , P1′ ) and that g ′ ∈ UP1′ gUP1 . Then there exist x ∈ UP ∩ P ′ , w′ ∈ UP ′ , w ∈ UP
such that g ′ = w′ xgw.
    By Lemma 8.9(c) we have g ′ = vgp with v ∈ UP ∩P ′ , p ∈ P . By assumption,
                        ′P                     ′P           −1
p−1 g −1 v −1 (vgp P )(P ) vgp = g −1 (g P )(P ) g that is p P1 = P1 , or p ∈ P1 . Also
g ′ = u′ gu with u′ ∈ UP1′ , u ∈ UP1 . Thus, g ′ = vgp = u′ gu. Setting π = pu−1 ∈ P1
we have vgπ = u′ g and v −1 u′ = g π. Now v −1 u′ ∈ UP ∩P ′ UP P ′ = UP P ′ . Thus
                                   ′
v −1 u′ ∈ UP P ′ ∩ g P1 . Since P P , g P1 are in good position, we have v −1 u′ ∈ UP P ′ ∩
Ug P1 . Thus g π ∈ Ug P1 and π ∈ UP1 . Since u ∈ UP1 , we have p ∈ UP1 . Thus g ′ ∈
                                                      ′P
UP ∩P ′ gUP1 = UP ∩P ′ Ug P1 g. Now g P1 = (g P )(P ) hence Ug P1 = (g P ∩ UP ′P )Ug P
so that

        g ′ ∈ UP ∩P ′ (g P ∩ UP ′ P )Ug P g = UP ∩P ′ (g P ∩ UP ′P )gUP ⊂ UP ′P gUP
         = UP ′ (UP ∩ P ′ )gUP .

Thus, g ′ = w′ xgw with w′ ∈ UP ′ , x ∈ P ′ ∩ UP , w ∈ UP , as desired.

8.13. We fix z ∈ J W J . Let J1 = J ∩ δ −1 Ad(y −1 z)J, J1′ = J ∩ Ad(z −1 y)δ(J), so
that Ad(z −1 y)δ(J1 ) = J1′ . Let Q, Q′ in PJ1 , PJ1′ be such that pos(Q′ , Q) ∈ WJ . Let
γ1 be a UQ′ , UQ double coset in Az −1 y (Q, Q′ ). Let F ′ be the set of all (P, P ′ , g) with
P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ PJ ′ , pos(P ′ , P ) = z, g ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ) such that α(P, P ′ , g) = (Q, Q′ )
and g ∈ γ1 . (Since Q′ ⊂ P , P is uniquely determined.) Let F be the set of
all (P, P ′ , γ) with P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ PJ ′ , pos(P ′ , P ) = z, γ ∈ UP ′ \Ay (P, P ′ )/UP
such that for some/any g ∈ γ ∩ A′y (P, P ′ ) we have α(P, P ′ , g) = (Q, Q′ ) and
g ∈ γ1 . (The equivalence of ”some/any” follows from Lemma 8.11.) Again, P is
uniquely determined. The map F ′ −       → F, (P, P ′, g) 7→ (P, P ′ , UP ′ gUP ) is surjective
by Lemma 8.9(b).
Lemma 8.14. F ′ is non-empty.
  Let g ∈ γ1 . Then pos(Q′ , g Q) = z −1 y. Define P ∈ PJ by Q ⊂ P . Since
pos(Q′ , Q) ∈ WJ , we have also Q′ ⊂ P . Let P̃ , P ′ in PJ , PJ ′ with pos(P ′ , P̃ ) = z.

By Lemma 8.9(c), we can find g̃ ∈ A′y (P̃ , P ′ ). Now α(P̃ , P ′ , g̃) = (Q̃, Q̃′ ) with
Q̃ ∈ PJ1 , Q̃′ ∈ PJ1′ contained in P̃ and pos(Q̃′ , g̃ Q̃) = z −1 y. We have Q′ = h Q̃′ for
some h ∈ G. Replacing P̃ , P ′ , g̃ by h P̃ , h P ′ , hg̃h−1 , we may assume that Q̃′ = Q′ .
Then P̃ ∈ PJ contains Q′ hence P̃ = P . Now Q̃, Q are contained in P and have
                                                                                   ′P
the same type hence Q̃ = p Q for some p ∈ P . We have g̃p Q = (g̃ P )(P ) and
g̃p ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ) hence α(P, P ′ , g̃p) = (Q, Q′ ). Since pos(Q′ , g Q) = pos(Q′ , g̃p Q)
and Q′ , g Q are in good position, we have g̃p = u′ gq with q ∈ Q, u′ ∈ UQ′ . Thus
u′ gq ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ) and α(P, P ′ , u′ gq) = (Q, Q′ ). We have u′ g ∈ A′y (P, P ′ ) and
α(P, P ′ , u′ g) = (Q, Q′ ) (we use that q ∈ Q). Since u′ g ∈ γ1 , we see that F ′ 6= ∅.
Lemma 8.15. Let (P, P ′ , g) ∈ F ′ . Then (u, v) 7→ (P, u P ′ , Uu P ′ uvgUP ) is a well
defined, surjective map κ : UP × (UP ∩ P ′ ) −
                                             → F.
    Let u ∈ UP , v ∈ UP ∩ P ′ . Clearly, (P, u P ′ , uvg) ∈ F ′ . Hence κ is well defined.
We show that κ is surjective. Let (P, P̃ ′ , γ) ∈ F . We can find g̃ ∈ γ such that
(P, P̃ ′ , g̃) ∈ F ′ . We have g ∈ γ1 , g̃ ∈ γ1 hence g̃ ∈ UQ′ gUQ . Since pos(P ′ , P ) =
                                                                         ′            ′     p ′
pos(P̃ ′ , P ), we have P̃ ′ = p P ′ for some p ∈ P . Since P P = P P̃ = P ( P ) =
     ′                             ′
pP P p−1 , we have p ∈ P P . Thus, p = uπ with π ∈ P ∩ P ′ , u ∈ UP . Since
p ′
  P = u P ′ , we may assume that p = u ∈ UP so that P̃ ′ = u P ′ . Applying Lemma
8.12 to (P, u P ′ , ug), (P, uP ′ , g̃) ∈ F ′ (instead of (P, P ′ , g), (P, P ′, g ′ )) we see that
g̃ = w′ xugw for some x ∈ UP ∩ u P ′ , w′ ∈ Uu P ′ , w ∈ UP . Let v = u−1 xu ∈ UP ∩ P ′ .
Then g̃ = w′ uvgw. Thus, (P, P̃ ′ , γ) = κ(u, v). The lemma is proved.
Lemma 8.16. In the setup of Lemma 8.15, the following two conditions for
(u, v), (u, v ′) in UP × (UP ∩ P ′ ) are equivalent:
   (i) κ(u, v) = κ(u′ , v ′ );
   (ii) u′ = uf, v ′ = f −1 dv for some f ∈ UP ∩ P ′ , d ∈ UP ∩ UP ′ .
                                                    ′
   Assume that (i) holds. We have u P ′ = u P ′ , uvg ∈ Uu P ′ u′ v ′ gUP . Thus u′ = uf
with f ∈ P ′ (hence f ∈ UP ∩ P ′ ) and uvg ∈ uUP ′ f v ′ gUP , that is, v ∈ UP ′ f v ′ Ug P ,
so that v ∈ f v ′ UP ′ Ug P . We show that
(a)                                  P ′ ∩ UP ′ Ug P = UP ′ .
Assume that x ∈ P ′ ∩ UP ′ Ug P . We must show that x ∈ UP ′ . We have u1 x ∈ Ug P
with u1 ∈ UP ′ . Let x′ = u1 x ∈ P ′ . Then x′ ∈ P ′ ∩ Ug P = UP ′ ∩ Ug P (by Lemma
8.6, which is applicable since P ′ , g P have a common Levi). Thus, x′ ∈ UP ′ hence
x ∈ UP ′ , as required.
    Applying (a) to v ′−1 f −1 v ∈ P ′ ∩ UP ′ Ug P , we see that v ′−1 f −1 v ∈ UP ′ , so that
v ′ = f −1 dv for some d ∈ UP ′ . We have d = f v ′ v −1 ∈ UP ∩P ′ . Hence d ∈ UP ∩UP ′ .
Thus, (ii) holds. The converse is immediate. The lemma is proved.
8.17. We consider a new group structure (d, f ) • (d′ , f ′ ) = (f ′ df ′−1 d′ , f ′ f ) on
(UP ∩ UP ′ ) × (UP ∩ P ′ ) and a new group structure (u, v) • (u′ , v ′ ) = (u′ u, vv ′ ) on
UP × (UP ∩ P ′ ). Then
       θ : (UP ∩ UP ′ ) × (UP ∩ P ′ ) −
                                      → UP × (UP ∩ P ′ ),           (d, f ) 7→ (f, f −1 d),
                        PARABOLIC CHARACTER SHEAVES, II                                  7

is an (injective) group homomorphism for these new group structures. We can
reformulate condition (ii) in 8.16 as follows:

            (u′ , v ′ ) = θ(x) • (u, v) for some x ∈ (UP ∩ UP ′ ) × (UP ∩ P ′ ).

We see that κ defines a bijection
                                                                          ∼
               θ(((UP ∩ UP ′ ) × (UP ∩ P ′ ))\(UP × (UP ∩ P ′ ))) −→ F.

One can check that this is in fact an isomorphism of algebraic varieties. Since
UP × (UP ∩ P ′ ) is a connected unipotent group and θ((UP ∩ UP ′ ) × (UP ∩ P ′ )) is
a connected closed subgroup of it, we see that
   (a) F is isomorphic to an affine space of dimension dim(UP /(UP ∩ UP ′ )).
                                  ′
8.18. Let J, J ′ ⊂ I and y ∈ J W δ(J) be such that Ad(y)δ(J) = J ′ . Let

          ZJ,y,δ = {(P, P ′ , γ); P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ PJ ′ , γ ∈ UP ′ \Ay (P, P ′ )/UP }.

To any (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ we associate a sequence (Jn , Jn′ , un )n≥0 with Jn , Jn′ ⊂
                                                   ′
I, un ∈ W , a sequence (yn )n≥0 with yn ∈ Jn W δ(Jn ) , Ad(yn )δ(Jn ) = Jn′ and a
sequence (Pn , Pn′ , γn )n≥0 with Pn ∈ PJn , Pn′ ∈ PJn′ , γn ⊂ Ayn (Pn , Pn′ ). We set

        P0 = P, P0′ = P ′ , γ0 = γ, J0 = J, J0′ = J ′ , u0 = pos(P0′ , P0 ), y0 = y.

and that um = pos(Pm , Pm ), Pm ∈ PJm , Pm ∈ PJm       ′ for m < n. Let

    Jn = Jn−1 ∩ δ −1 Ad(yn−1 un−1 )Jn−1 , Jn′ = Jn−1 ∩ Ad(u−1

          Pn = gn−1 (   Pn−1 )(Pn−1              )
                                                     gn−1 ∈ PJn , Pn′ = Pn−1
                                                                          n−1
                                                                              ∈ PJn′
where
                          gn−1 ∈ γn−1 ∩ A′yn−1 (Pn−1 , Pn−1
                                                        ′
                                                            ),
               un = pos(Pn′ , Pn ), yn = u−1
                                          n−1 yn−1 , γn = UPn′ gn−1 UPn .

This completes the inductive definition; the definition makes sense (it is indepen-
dent of choices) by 8.9-8.11. We have (Jn , Jn′ , un )n≥0 ∈ S(J, Ad(y)δ) (see 2.3). We
write (Jn , Jn′ , un )n≥0 = β(P, P ′ , γ). For s ∈ S(J, Ad(y)δ) let
                     s
                    ZJ,y,δ = {(P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ ; β(P, P ′ , γ) = s}.
             s
Clearly, (ZJ,y,δ  )s∈S(J,Ad(y)δ) is a partition of ZJ,y,δ into locally closed subvarieties.
The G-action on ZJ,y,δ given by g : (P, P ′ , γ) 7→ (g P, g P ′ , gγg −1) preserves each
                   s
of the pieces ZJ,y,δ   . Now (P, P ′ , γ) 7→ (P1 , P1′ , γ1 ) is a morphism f : ZJ,y,δ
                                                                                  s
                                                                                        −
                                                                                        →

Lemma 8.19. (a) The morphism ϑ : ZJ,y,δ    s
                                                −→ ZJs11 ,y1 ,δ is a locally trivial fibration
with fibres isomorphic to an affine space of dimension l(u0 ) + νJ − νJ1 .
                                                            s
   (b) Let ϑ̄ be the map from the set of G-orbits on ZJ,y,δ        to the set of G-orbits on
 s1
ZJ1 ,y1 ,δ induced by ϑ. Then ϑ̄ is a bijection.
   We prove (a). Let (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ
                                      s
                                           . From 8.17 and 8.1(a) we see that each
fibre of ϑ is an affine space of dimension

dim(UP /(UP ∩ UP ′ )) = l(u) + νJ − νJ∩Ad(u−1 )J ′ = l(u) + νJ − νJ1′ = l(u) + νJ − νJ1 .
                                                  0


The verification of local triviality is omitted.
    We prove (b). From the fact that ϑ is surjective (see (a)) and G-equivariant,
it follows that ϑ̄ is well defined and surjective. We show that ϑ̄ is injective. Let
(P, P ′ , γ), (P̃ , P̃ ′ , γ̃) be two triples in ZJ,y,δ
                                                  s
                                                        whose images under ϑ are in the same
G-orbit; we must show that these two triples are in the same G-orbit. Since ϑ is G-
equivariant, we may assume that ϑ(P, P ′ , γ) = ϑ(P̃ , P̃ ′ , γ̃) = (Q, Q′ , γ1 ) ∈ ZJs11 ,y1 ,δ .
Define F in terms of (Q, Q′ , γ1 ) as in 8.13. Then (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ F, (P̃ , P̃ ′ , γ̃) ∈ F .
Since P, P̃ are parabolics of the same type containing Q′ we have P = P̃ . Let
g ∈ γ ∩ A′y (P, P ′ ). By Lemma 8.15, there exist u ∈ UP , v ∈ UP ∩ P ′ such that
P̃ ′ = u P ′ , γ̃ = Uu P ′ uvgUP . We have also P̃ = uv P (since uv ∈ P ), P̃ ′ = uv P ′
(since v ∈ P ′ ),

          γ̃ = uUP ′ vgUP = uvUP ′ gUP = uvUP ′ gUP v −1 u−1 = uvγv −1 u−1

(since v normalizes UP ′ and uv ∈ UP ). Thus, (P̃ , P̃ ′ , γ̃) is obtained by the action
of uv ∈ G on (P, P ′ , γ), hence (P̃ , P̃ ′ , γ̃) is in the G-orbit of (P, P ′ , γ). The lemma
is proved.
Lemma 8.20. Let s = (Jn , Jn′ , un )n≥0 ∈ S(J, Ad(y)δ). Then ZJ,y,δ
                                                                s
                                                                       is an iterated
affine space bundle (with fibre dimension l(w)+νJ −νJm , w = u0 u1 . . . um , m ≫ 0)
over a fibre bundle over PJm with fibres isomorphic to P/UP with P ∈ PJm ,
                         s
m ≫ 0. In particular, ZJ,y,δ   6= ∅.
   Assume first that s is such that Jn = Jn′ = J and un = 1 for all n ≥ 0. (Then
Ad(y)δ(J) = J, y ∈ J W δ(J) .) In this case, ZJ,y,δ
                                              s
                                                    is the set of all (P, P ′ , γ) with
P = P ′ ∈ PJ , γ ∈ UP \Ay (P, P )/UP . (The associated sequence (Pn , Pn′ , γn ) is in
this case Pn = Pn′ = P, γn = γ.) Thus, ZJ,y,δ
                                          s
                                              is a locally trivial fibration over PJ
with fibres isomorphic to P/UP for P ∈ PJ and the lemma holds.
   We now consider a general s. For any r ≥ 0 let

                          sr = (Jn , Jn′ , un )n≥r ∈ S(Jr , Ad(yr )δ)

(yr as in 8.18). By 8.19(a) we have a sequence of affine space bundles

where for r ≫ 0, ZJsrr ,yr ,δ is as in the first part of the proof. By 8.19(a), the sum
of dimensions of fibres of the maps in this sequence is

Indeed, for m ≫ 0 we have N = ♯(G(Fq )/Pm (Fq ))               ν −ν

that l(w) + νJ − νI ≥ 0.
8.21. In the setup of 8.20, the maps in 8.20(a) induce bijections on the sets of
G-orbits (see 8.19(b)). Thus we obtain a canonical bijection between the set of
              s
G-orbits on ZJ,y,δ and the set of G-orbits on ZJsrr ,yr ,δ with r large enough so that
Jr = Jr′ = Jr+1 = Jr+1′
                          = . . . , ur = ur+1 = · · · = 1. This last set of orbits
is canonically the set of Q-orbits on UQ \Ayr (Q, Q)/UQ where Q ∈ PJr . The
Q-action (conjugation) factors through Q/UQ . Let Ls be a Levi of Q. Then

                       C s = {g ∈ G1 ; g Ls = Ls , pos(g Q, Q) = yr }
                                                                                            ∼
is a connected component of NĜ (Ls ). We have an obvious bijection C s −→
UQ \Ayr (Q, Q)/UQ under which the action of Ls on C s by conjugation corre-
sponds to the action of Q/UQ on UQ \Ayr (Q, Q)/UQ by conjugation. Thus we
                                                              s
obtain a canonical bijection between the set of G-orbits on ZJ,y,δ and the set of
  s                        s
L -conjugacy classes in C (a connected component of an algebraic group with
identity component Ls ). Putting together these bijections we obtain a bijection

(a)                         G\ZJ,y,δ ↔ ⊔s∈S(J,Ad(y)δ) Ls \C s

where G\ZJ,y,δ is the set of G-orbits on ZJ,y,δ and Ls \C s is the set of Ls -orbits
on C s (for the conjugation action).

                         9. Comparison of two partitions
9.1. In the case where y = 1, Sections 3 and 8 provide two methods to partition
ZJ,y,δ . In this section we show that the resulting partitions of ZJ,y,δ are the same.
Lemmas 9.2, 9.3 hold for any y, but in 9.4, 9.5 we assume that y = 1.
Lemma 9.2. Let (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ . Let n ≥ 1. Let P1′ , Pn be as in 8.18. We
have pos(P ′ , Pn ) = pos(P ′ , P1′ )pos(P1′ , Pn ).
10                                          G. LUSZTIG

   Let z = pos(P ′ , P1′ ), z̃ = pos(P ′ , Pn ), x = pos(P1′ , Pn ). We have z = pos(P ′ , P )
                ′                             ′
hence z ∈ J W J . We have also z̃ ∈ J W . Since Pn ⊂ P we have z̃ ∈ WJ ′ zWJ .
Using 2.1(c) with x, x′ replaced by z, z̃, we see that z̃ = zv with v ∈ WJ . Let
B, B ′ ∈ B be such that B ⊂ P ′ , B ′ ⊂ Pn , pos(B, B ′ ) = z̃. Since z ∈ W J , we have
l(zv) = l(z) + l(v). Hence there is a unique B ′′ ∈ B such that pos(B, B ′′ ) = z,
pos(B ′′ , B ′ ) = v. Since B ′ ⊂ P and pos(B ′′ , B) ∈ WJ , we have B ′′ ⊂ P . Since
                                                                                   ′
B ⊂ P ′ , B ′′ ⊂ P and pos(B, B ′′ ) = pos(P ′ , P ) = z, we have B ′′ ⊂ P P = P1′ .
Since B ′′ ⊂ P1′ , B ′ ⊂ Pn , we have pos(B ′′ , B ′ ) ≥ x, hence v ≥ x. We can find
B1 , B2 ∈ B such that B1 ⊂ P1′ , B2 ⊂ Pn , pos(B1 , B2 ) = x. Since pos(P ′ , P ) = z
                  ′
and B1 ⊂ P P , we can find B0 ∈ B such that B0 ⊂ P ′ , pos(B0 , B1 ) = z. Since
z ∈ W J , x ∈ WJ , we have pos(B0 , B2 ) = zx. We have B0 ⊂ P ′ , B2 ⊂ Pn hence
pos(B0 , B2 ) ≥ pos(P ′ , Pn ), that is, zx ≥ z̃ = zv. Thus, we have v ≥ x and
zx ≥ zv. Since z ∈ W J and x, v ∈ WJ we have x = v. Thus, z̃ = zx. The lemma
is proved.
Lemma 9.3. Let (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ . Let Pn′ , Pn , un , γn be as in 8.18. For any
n ≥ 0 we have pos(P ′ , Pn ) = u0 u1 . . . un .
   We argue by induction on n = 0. For n = 0 the result is clear. Assume
                                                                ′
now that n ≥ 1. We have pos(P ′ , P1′ ) = pos(P ′ , P P ) = pos(P ′ , P ) = u0 . Us-
ing the induction hypothesis for (P1 , P1′ , γ1 ) and n − 1 (instead of (P, P ′ , γ) and
n) we see that pos(P1′ , Pn ) = u1 . . . un . By Lemma 9.2 we have pos(P ′ , Pn ) =
pos(P ′ , P1′ )pos(P1′ , Pn ) = u0 (u1 . . . un ). The lemma is proved.
Lemma 9.4. Let J ⊂ I. Let (P, P ′ , g) ∈ ZJ,δ . To (P, P ′ , g) we associate
P n , P ′n , wn as in 4.11. To (P, P ′ , UP ′ gUP ) we associate Pn , Pn′ , γn , un , yn as in
8.18 (with y = 1). For any n ≥ 0, the following hold:
   (an ) Pn = P n ;
                         ′ n−1
   (bn ) Pn′ = (P n−1 )P       ;
   (cn ) g ∈ γn ∩ A′yn (Pn , Pn′ );
                  ′ Pn            n
     (dn ) (P ′n )(Pn ) = (P ′n )P ;
     (en ) wn = u0 u1 . . . un .
   We argue by induction on n. The result is obvious for n = 0: we have P0 = P 0 =
                                                         ′P
P ; g P0 = P ′ contains a Levi of P ∩ P ′ ; we have P ′(P ) = P ′P . We have w0 = u0 .
We now assume that n ≥ 1 and that (an−1 ), (bn−1 ), (cn−1 ), (dn−1 ), (en−1 ) hold.
   We show that (an ) holds. Using (cn−1 ), (an−1 ), (dn−1 ), we have
                                        ′   Pn−1                                ′    P n−1
                Pn = g −1 (g Pn−1 )(Pn−1              )
                                                          g = g −1 (g P n−1 )(Pn−1           )
                                                                                                 g
                                  ′     P n−1                             n−1
                = g −1 (P ′n−1 )(Pn−1           )
                                                    g = g −1 (P ′n−1 )P         g = P n.
hence (an ) holds.
   We show that (bn ) holds, using (an−1 ), (bn−1 ), (en−1 ), (an). It suffices to show
that Y ′ = Pn′ satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma 3.2(a) with P, P ′ , a, J, δ(J) re-
placed by P n−1 , P ′n−1 , wn−1 , Jn−1 , δ(Jn−1 ). By definition we have Y ′ ⊂ Pn−1 =
                         PARABOLIC CHARACTER SHEAVES, II                                   11

                                                                                            ′n−1
P n−1 . The type of Y ′ is Jn−1 ∩Ad(u0 u1 . . . un−1 )−1 δ(Jn−1 ) while that of (P n−1 )P
                  −1                                             ′n−1
is Jn−1 ∩ Ad(wn−1     )δ(Jn−1 ). Thus, Y ′ and (P n−1 )P               have the same type.
        g        g n        ′n          ′n−1 P n−1           ′ g
Since Pn = P = P                = (P          )        and Pn , Pn are in good position,
                                                −1                            n−1

pos(Pn , Pn ) = (u0 u1 . . . un−1 )      = wn−1 , we see that (P ′n−1 )P          , Pn′ are in
                                 n−1
good position, pos((P ′n−1 )P        , Pn′ ) = wn−1 . Thus, the hypotheses of Lemma
3.2(a) are satisfied and (bn ) holds.
   We show that (cn ) holds,                      using (an ), (bn), (cn−1 ).            Since
g ∈ γn−1 ∩ Ayn−1 (Pn−1 , Pn−1 ) and γn−1 ∩ Ayn−1 (Pn−1 , Pn−1 ) ⊂ γn ∩ Ayn (Pn , Pn′ )

(see 8.10) we have g ∈ γn ∩ Ayn (Pn , Pn′ ). It remains to show that g Pn con-
                                                                     n−1
tains a Levi of Pn ∩ Pn′ or equivalently, that (P ′n−1 )P                contains a Levi of
   n−1 P ′n−1      −1   ′n−1 P n−1
(P     )       ∩ g (P        )      g. This follows from Lemma 3.2(b) with P, P ′ , Z
                                             n−1
replaced by P n−1 , P ′n−1 , g −1 (P ′n−1 )P      g.
   We show that (dn ) holds, using (an ), (bn). This follows from Lemma 3.2(d)
                                                             n−1
with P, P ′ , Z replaced by P n−1 , P ′n−1 , g −1 (P ′n−1 )P     g.
   We show that (en ) holds, using (an ). Since pos(P , P n ) = wn , P ′n ⊂ P ′ and
                                                              ′n

wn ∈ J W we have pos(P ′ , P n ) = wn . We also have pos(P ′ , Pn ) = u0 u1 . . . un (see
Lemma 9.3). Since P n = Pn , we have wn = u0 u1 . . . un .
   This completes the inductive proof.
Proposition 9.5. Let J ⊂ I. Let s = (Jn , Jn′ , un )n≥0 ∈ S(J, δ) and let t ∈ T (J, δ)
                                                                   s
be the corresponding element under the bijection in 2.4. Then ZJ,δ    = t ZJ,δ .
   Let P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ Pδ(J) , g ∈ A1 (P, P ′ ) = A′1 (P, P ′ ). Assume that

                   (P, P ′ , UP ′ gUP ) ∈ ZJ,δ
                                           s̃
                                               , (P, P ′ , UP ′ gUP ) ∈ t ZJ,δ

where s̃ = (J˜n , J˜n′ , ũn )n≥0 ∈ S(J, δ). Using Lemma 9.4(e), we see that
     ũ0 ũ1 . . . ũn = u0 u1 . . . un
for all n. Using Lemma 2.5, we have s̃ = s. Thus, t ZJ,δ ⊂ ZJ,δ       s
                                                                        . Conversely, let
                                                  ′
          ′            s                  ′      t                  ′
(Q, Q , γ) ∈ ZJ,δ . We have (Q, Q , γ) ∈ ZJ,δ for a unique t ∈ T (J, δ). By the
                                                      s′
first part of the proof we have (Q, Q′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,δ       where s′ ∈ S(J, δ) corresponds
                                                                         s′
to t′ under the bijection in 2.4. We have (Q, Q′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,δ     s

   s        s′                                              ′               ′
ZJ,δ , ZJ,δ are either disjoint or coincide. Thus, s = s hence t = t . We see that
   s
ZJ,δ    ⊂ t ZJ,δ . The proposition is proved.

To V∗ , V∗′ we associate two n2 -step filtrations X∗ , X∗′ :

        0 = X10 ⊂ X11 ⊂ X12 ⊂ . . . ⊂ X1n = X20 ⊂ X21 ⊂ X22 ⊂ X2n = X30

where
                       Xij = Vi−1 + (Vi ∩ Vj′ ), (i, j) ∈ [1, n] × [0, n],
                       ′      ′
                      Xij = Vi−1 + (Vi′ ∩ Vj ), (i, j) ∈ [1, n] × [0, n].
Here the indexing set is [1, n]×[0, n] with the identifications 1n = 20, . . . , (n−1)n =
                                ′       ′
n0. We have Xi0 = Vi−1 , Xi0      = Vi−1   for i ∈ [1, n]. Hence X∗ (resp. X∗′ ) is a
refinement of V∗ (resp. V∗ ). If the stabilizer of V∗ (resp. V∗′ ) is the parabolic P
                             ′

(resp. P ′ ) then the stabilizer of X∗ (resp. X∗′ ) in G is the parabolic P P (resp.
P ′P ). By Zassenhaus’ lemma, we have a canonical isomorphism

    Let Σ be the set of all quadruples (V∗ , V∗′ , σ, ai) with V∗ , V∗′ as above (of pre-
scribed types) and σ, ai are as above. Then Σ may be identified with a set
ZJ,y,1 attached to G = GL(V ). Here J, Ad(y)J are the types of V∗ , V∗′ . Let
(V∗ , V∗′ , σ, ai) ∈ Σ. We define a sequence (V∗m , V∗′ m , σ m , ami )m≥0 of quadruples of

and the relative position of V∗m , V∗′ m is specified for each m ≥ 0 is a locally closed
subvariety of Σ. Thus we obtain a partition of Σ which coincides with the partition

we omit the 0 and d dimensional members of a 2-step filtration.) We describe
explicitly in this case the partition of Σ given in 10.1. For any k ∈ [1, d] let Σ̃k be
the set of all quadruples

where 0 = V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Vk is a (partial) flag in V , dim Vj = j for all j,

V1′ is a line in V , a : V1 −→ V1′ , b : V /V1 −→ V /V1′ are isomorphisms and
   V1′ ∩ Vk−1 = 0, V1′ ⊂ Vk ,

Define πk : Σ̃k − → Σ by πk (0 = V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Vk , V1′ , a, b) = (V1 , V1′ , a, b).

Define πk : Σ̃k −→ Σ by πk (0 = V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Vk , H, a, b) = (V1 , H, a, b).
Then πk is injective and (πk (Σk ))k∈[1,d] is a partition of Σ into d locally closed

                    11. Parabolic character sheaves on ZJ,y,δ
11.1. Assume that we are in the setup of 8.18. Let x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xr ) be a
sequence in W such that
(a)                                       r ≥ 2, xr = y.
As in 4.2 we define
Yx = {(B0 , B1 , B2 , . . . , Br , g) ∈ Br+1 ×G1 ; pos(Bi−1 , Bi ) = xi , i ∈ [1, r], Br = g B0 }.
  Let y Yx′ be the set of all (B0 , B1 , B2 , . . . , Br−1 , γ) where (B0 , B1 , B2 , . . . , Br−1 ) ∈
B satisfies pos(Bi−1 , Bi ) = xi , i ∈ [1, r − 1] and γ ∈ UP ′ \Ay (P, P ′ )/UP (with
 r

P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ PJ ′ given by B0 ⊂ P, Br−1 ⊂ P ′ ) satisfies pos(Br−1 , g B0 ) = xr for
some/any g ∈ γ. (This definition is correct since UP ⊂ B0 , UP ′ ⊂ Br−1 .) We have
an affine space bundle
             → y Yx′ ,
      ω : Yx −           (B0 , B1 , B2 , . . . , Br , g) 7→ (B0 , B1 , B2 , . . . , Br−1 , UP ′ gUP )
(with P, P ′ as above). Define
               Πx : y Yx′ −
                          → ZJ,y,δ ,      Πx (B0 , B1 , . . . , Br−1 , γ) = (P, P ′ , γ)
where P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ PJ ′ are given by B0 ⊂ P, Br−1 ⊂ P ′ .
   If L ∈ S(T ) (see 4.1) is such that x1 x2 . . . xr ∈ WL1 (see 4.1), the local system
L̃ on Yx is defined (see 4.2); it is ω ∗ of a well defined local system on y Yx′ denoted
again by L̃. We set
                              KxL = (Πx )! L̃ ∈ D(ZJ,y,δ ).
     Now assume in addition that
(b)                             xi ∈ I ⊔ {1} for i ∈ [1, r − 1].
Let Y ′†x be the set of all (B0 , B1 , B2 , . . . , Br−1 , γ) where (B0 , B1 , B2 , . . . , Br−1 ) ∈
Br satisfies pos(Bi−1 , Bi ) = {xi , 1}, i ∈ [1, r − 1] and γ ∈ UP ′ \Ay (P, P ′ )/UP (with
P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ PJ ′ given by B0 ⊂ P, Br−1 ⊂ P ′ ) satisfies pos(Br−1 , g B0 ) = y for
some/any g ∈ γ. Define
               Π†x : Y ′†x −
                           → ZJ,y,δ      Π†x (B0 , B1 , . . . , Br−1 , γ) = (P, P ′ , γ)
where P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ PJ ′ are given by B0 ⊂ P, Br−1 ⊂ P ′ . Now y Yx′ is an open
dense subset subset of Y ′†x and it carries the local system L̃. The intersection
cohomology complex IC(Y ′†x , L̃) is a constructible sheaf L̄ on Y ′†x (compare 4.3);
we set
                            K̄xL = (Π†x )! L̄ ∈ D(ZJ,y,δ ).
Now Π†x is a proper morphism. (Indeed, the condition pos(Br−1 , g B0 ) = y in
the definition of Y ′†x can be replaced by the closed condition pos(Br−1 , g B0 ) ≤ y
since g B0 ⊂ g P, Br−1 ⊂ P ′ and pos(P ′ , g P ) = y.) Hence we may apply the
decomposition theorem [BBD] and we see that
   K̄xL is a semisimple complex on ZJ,y,δ .

Proposition 11.2. Let L ∈ S(T ) and let A be a simple perverse sheaf on ZJ,δ .
The following conditions on A are equivalent:
  (i) A ⊣ KxL for some x as in 11.1(a) with x1 x2 . . . xr ∈ WL1 ;
             L
  (ii) A ⊣ Kx,y   for some x ∈ W such that xy ∈ WL1 ;
  (iii) A ⊣ K̄xL for some x as in 11.1(b) with x1 x2 . . . xr ∈ WL1 .
   (Compare 4.4.)

11.3. Let CJ,y,δ be the set of isomorphism classes of simple perverse sheaves on
ZJ,y,δ which satisfy the equivalent conditions 11.2(i)-(iii) with respect to L. The
                                                    L
simple perverse sheaves on ZJ,y,δ which belong to CJ,y,δ  for some L ∈ T are called
parabolic character sheaves; they (or their isomorphism classes) form a set CJ,y,δ .
11.4. Let (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ . Let γ ′ = γ ∩ A′y (P, P ′ ). Let z = pos(P ′ , P ). Let
(P1 , P1′ ) = α(P, P ′ , g) where g ∈ γ ′ (see 8.10, 8.11). We have pos(P1′ , g P1 ) = z −1 y
                    ′
and pos(P ′P , P P ) = z (see 8.10). Let w ∈ W . We can write uniquely w = ab, a ∈
    ′
W J , b ∈ WJ ′ . Let

    X = {(B, B ′ ) ∈ B × B; pos(B, B ′ ) = w, pos(B ′ , g B) = y, B ⊂ P, B ′ ⊂ P ′ }.

Here g ∈ γ ′ ; the choice of g is irrelevant since UP ⊂ B, UP ′ ⊂ B ′ . Set b′ = y −1 by ∈
Wδ(J) . (Recall that yWδ(J) = WJ ′ y.) Let

            X ′ ={(B̃, B, B̃ ′) ∈ B3 ; pos(B̃, B) = δ −1 (b′ ), pos(B, B̃ ′ ) = az,
                 pos(B̃ ′ , g B̃) = z −1 y, B̃ ⊂ P1 , B̃ ′ ⊂ P1′ }.

(We have automatically B ⊂ P .) Here g ∈ γ ′ ; the choice of g is irrelevant since
UP1′ ⊂ B̃ ′ , UP1 ⊂ B̃ (another choice of g is in UP1′ gUP1 by 8.11). Define

                                  µ
                              → X ′,
                            X −                (B, B ′ ) 7→ (B̃, B, B̃ ′)

as follows. Define R by pos(B, R) = a, pos(R, B ′ ) = b (we have l(w) = l(a) + l(b)).
Define B̃ ′ by pos(B, B̃ ′ ) = az, pos(B̃ ′ , R) = z −1 (we have l(az) + l(z −1 ) = l(a)).
Define Sg (in terms of g ∈ γ ′ ) by pos(R, Sg ) = y, pos(Sg , g B) = b′ ; we use l(b) +
                                                    −1
l(y) = l(by) = l(yb′ ) = l(y) + l(b′ ). Set B̃ = g Sg . We will show below that
   (i) if (B, B ′ ) ∈ X then (B̃, B, B̃ ′ ) ∈ X ′ ;
   (ii) B̃ is independent of the choice of g in γ ′ .
Assume that (i) is already established (for fixed g ∈ γ ′ ). Let us replace g by
g1 ∈ γ ′ . Then g1 = u′ gu where u ∈ UP , u′ ∈ UP ′ . We have pos(R, Sg1 ) =
               ′
y, pos(Sg1 , u gu B) = b′ . Hence

                    pos(u        R, u       Sg1 ) = y, pos(u        Sg1 , g B) = b′ .

Since pos(R, B ′ ) ∈ WJ ′ we have R ⊂ P ′ hence u′ ∈ R and u R = R and
        ′−1               ′ −1                                    ′ −1
pos(R, u Sg1 ) = y, pos(u Sg1 , g B) = b′ . It follows that Sg = u Sg1 . Hence

             u−1 g −1 u′ −1          −1 −1
                                             u′ −1 u′         −1 −1            −1
                              Sg1 = u    g
                                                 ( Sg ) = u      g
                                                                      Sg = u B̃ = B̃

(since by (i), we have B̃ ⊂ P1 ⊂ P hence u ∈ B̃). Thus (ii) is verified.
                                                      ′
   We now verify (i) (with fixed g ∈ γ ′ ). Since P P , P ′P , g P1 have a common Levi
L0 , there is a canonical trijection 0 B ↔ 1 B ↔ 2 B between the sets of Borels
       ′
of P P , P ′P , g P1 respectively, defined by 0 B = UP P ′ β, 1 B = UP ′ P β, 2 B = Ug P1 β
where β is a Borel of L0 or equivalently by

             pos(0 B, 1 B) = z −1 , pos(1 B, 2 B) = y, pos(0 B, 2 B) = z −1 y

(any two of these three conditions implies the third).
   Assume that B, B ′ , R, S, tB, B̃ ′ are as above. We have R ⊂ P ′P (since a =
                                             ′
pos(B, R) = pos(B, P ′ )) and B̃ ′ ⊂ P P (since z −1 = pos(B̃ ′ , R) = pos(P, P ′ )).
Hence B̃ ′ ↔ R ↔ Y under the trijection above where Y is a Borel of g P1 . (We
have pos(B̃ ′ , R) = z −1 , pos(R, Y ) = y, pos(B̃ ′ , Y ) = z −1 y.)
   Since P ′ , gP have a common Levi, there is a canonical bijection B 0 ↔ B 1
between the sets of Borels of P ′ , g P respectively, defined by pos(B 0 , B 1 ) = y.
Since pos(R, Y ) = y, we have R ↔ Y under this bijection; since pos(R, S) = y, we
have R ↔ S under this bijection; hence Y = S. We see that S ⊂ g P1 and B̃ ⊂ P1 .
We have pos(S, g B) = b′ hence pos(B̃, B) = δ −1 (b′ ). Define

                                    µ′
                                X ′ −→ X ,     (B̃, B, B̃ ′ ) 7→ (B, B ′ )

as follows. Choose g ∈ γ ′ . Define R, S by the condition that B̃ ′ ↔ R ↔ S
under the canonical trijection above. Define B ′ by the condition pos(R, B ′ ) =
b, pos(B ′ , g B) = y (we use l(b) + l(y) = l(by) = l(yb′ ) = l(y) + l(b′ )). We will show
below that
    (iii) if (B̃, B, B̃ ′ ) ∈ X ′ then (B, B ′ ) ∈ X ;
    (iv) B ′ is independent of the choice of g in γ ′ .
Now (iv) follows from (iii) in the same way that (ii) follows from (i). We now
verify (iii) (with fixed g ∈ γ ′ ). Assume that B̃, B, B̃ ′ , R, B ′ are as above. We have
R ⊂ P ′P hence R ⊂ P ′ . Since pos(R, B ′ ) ∈ WJ ′ we have B ′ ⊂ P ′ . We have
pos(B, B̃ ′ ) = az, pos(B̃ ′ , R) = z −1 , l(az) + l(z −1 ) = l(a) hence pos(B, R) = a.
This, together with pos(R, B ′ ) = b, l(ab) = l(a)+l(b) implies pos(B, B ′ ) = ab = w.
Thus (B, B ′ ) ∈ X and µ′ is well defined.
    From the definitions we see that µ′ is the inverse of µ.

11.7. In the setup of 11.4, we assume in addition that b ∈ WAd(y)δ(J1 ) that is,
b′ ∈ Wδ(J1 ) where J1 = J ∩ δ −1 Ad(y −1 z)J. Assume that (B, B ′ ) ∈ X . We show
that
                                     B ⊂ P1 .
Let R, S, B̃, B̃ ′ be as in the definition of µ in terms of some g ∈ γ ′ . (Thus,
µ(B, B ′ ) = (B̃, B, B̃ ′ ).) By 11.4, we have S ⊂ g P1 . Since pos(S, g B) = b′ ∈ Wδ(J1 )
and g P1 has type δ(J1 ), we have g B ⊂ g P1 and B ⊂ P1 .
11.8. In the setup of 11.4 and 11.7, we have for B, B ′ , B̃, B̃ ′ as in 11.7 az =
pos(B, B̃ ′ ) ∈ J1 W (since B ⊂ P1 ) and pos(B̃, B) = δ −1 (b′ ) ∈ WJ1 hence
   l(δ −1 (b′ )az) = l(δ −1 (b′ )) + l(az).
It follows that pos(B̃, B̃ ′ ) = δ −1 (b′ )az. We see that (B̃, B, B̃ ′ ) 7→ (B̃, B̃ ′ ) defines
                         ∼
an isomorphism X ′ −→ X ′′ where

X ′′ = {(B̃, B̃ ′ ) ∈ B2 ; pos(B̃, B̃ ′ ) = δ −1 (b′ )az, pos(B̃ ′ , g B̃) = z −1 y, B̃ ⊂ P1 , B̃ ′ ⊂ P1′ }.
                                                               ∼
Combining with the isomorphism µ : X −→ X ′ we see that (B, B ′ ) 7→ (tB, B̃ ′ ) is
an isomorphism
                                                           ∼
(a)                                                    X −→ X ′′ .

Now let                                      −1
                 Yδ′′−1 (b′ )az,z −1 y = z        y
                                                      Yδ′−1 (b′ )az,z −1 y ×ZJ           −1 y,δ   ZJ,y,δ;z
                                                                                  1 ,z

where the fibre product is formed using the canonical maps
                        z −1 y
                                 Yδ′−1 (b′ )az,z −1 y −
                                                      → ZJ1 ,z −1 y,δ ←
                                                                      − ZJ,y,δ;z .

Then (a) gives rise to an isomorphism
                                            ′ z        ∼
                                       y

compatible with the natural maps of the two sides into ZJ,y,δ;z . As in 11.5 this
gives rise to a cartesian diagram

                                                                                                      −1
Now let L, L′ be as in 11.6. Let L̃, L̃′ the local systems on y Yw,y
                                                                  ′

corresponding as in 11.1 to L, L′ . From the definitions we see that the inverse image

of L̃′ under y Yw,y
                ′ z

                                    ′ z
same as the restriction of L̃ to y Yw,y .

11.9. Let w = ab, b′ be as in 11.4. Let s = (Jn , Jn′ , un )n≥0 ∈ S(J, Ad(y)δ). For

11.11. Let L ∈ S(T ), let x be as in 11.1(a) (with r = 3) and let s ∈ S(J, Ad(y)δ).
Let L ∈ S(T ) be such that x1 x2 y ∈ WL1 and let L̃ be the corresponding local
system on y Yx′1 ,x2 ,y . Let A′ be a simple perverse sheaf on y Yx′1 ,x2 ,y s such that
A′ ⊣ ((Πx1 ,x2 ,y )! L̃)|ZJ,y,δ
                          s     . We show that
   (a) there exists x0 ∈ W such that x0 y ∈ WL1 and A′ ⊣ ((Πx0 ,y )! L̃)|ZJ,y,δ
                                                                          s


(we denote the local system on y Yx′0 ,y corresponding to L again by L̃).
   The proof is similar to that of Lemma 4.8. We argue by induction on l(x2 ). If
l(x2 ) = 0 then x2 = 1, we may identify y Yx′1 ,x2 ,y , y Yx′1 ,y and the result is obvious.
Assume now that l(x2 ) > 0. We can find s ∈ W such that l(s) = 1, l(x2 ) > l(sx2 ).
   Assume first that l(x1 s) = l(x1 ) + 1. Then

(b)                              pos(B1 , B1′ ) = s, pos(B1′ , B2 ) = sx2

is an isomorphism. Under this isomorphism, L̃ on y Yx′1 ,x2 ,y corresponds to the
analogous local system on y Yx′1 s,sx2 ,y . We have A′ ⊣ ((Πx1 s,sx2 ,y )! L̃)|ZJ,y,δ
                                                                                s     . We
may apply the induction hypothesis to x1 s, sx2 , y; the desired result follows.

    Assume next that l(x1 s) = l(x1 ) + 1. Then we have a partition y Yx′1 ,x2 ,y =
′
  Y ⊔ ′′ Y where ′ Y is the open subset defined by pos(B0 , B1′ ) = x1 (with B1′ as in
(b)) and ′′ Y is the closed subset defined by pos(B0 , B1′ ) = x1 s (with B1′ as in (b)).
Let ′ Π : ′ Y −
              → ZJ,y,δ , ′′ Π : ′′ Y −
                                     → ZJ,y,δ be the restrictions of Πx1 ,x2 ,y to ′ Y, ′′ Y .
By general principles, we have either
    (c) A′ ⊣ (′ Π! L̃)|ZJ,y,δ
                        s     or
     (d) A′ ⊣ (′′ Π! L̃)|ZJ,y,δ
                          s


where the restriction of L̃ to ′ Y or ′′ Y is denoted again by L̃.
  Assume that (d) holds. Then

                ι′′ : ′′ Y −
                           → y Yx′1 s,sx2 ,y ,    (B0 , B1 , B2 , γ) 7→ (B0 , B1′ , B2 , γ)

with B1′ as in (b), is a line bundle and ι′′! L̃ is up to shift the local system on
y ′
 Yx1 s,sx2 ,y attached to L (we denote it again by L̃). Since ′′ Π = Πx1 s,sx2 ,y ι′′ , it
follows that A′ ⊣ ((Πx1 s,sx2 ,y )! L̃)|ZJ,y,δ
                                         s     . We may apply the induction hypothesis
to x1 s, sx2 , y; the desired result follows.
   Assume now that (c) holds. Then

                  ι′ : ′ Y −
                           → y Yx′1 ,sx2 ,y ,    (B0 , B1 , B2 , γ) 7→ (B0 , B1′ , B2 , γ)

with B1′ as in (b), makes Y ′ into the complement of the zero section of a line
bundle over y Yx′1 ,sx2 ,y and we have ′ Π = Πx1 s,sx2 ,y ι′ . In the case where
   (e) the inverse image of L under the coroot k∗ −     → T corresponding to y −1 x−1   2 sx2 y
is Q̄l ,
(so that x1 sx2 y ∈ WL1 ), L̃ (on ′ Y ) is ι′∗ of the local system on y Yx′1 ,sx2 ,y (denoted
by L̃′ ) hence we have an exact triangle consisting of ι′! L̃, L̃′ and a shift of L̃′ . Hence
A′ ⊣ ((Πx1 ,sx2 ,y )! L̃)|ZJ,y,δ
                           s     . We may apply the induction hypothesis to x1 , sx2 , y;
the desired result follows. In the case where (e) does not hold, we have ι′! L̃ = 0
hence ′ Π! L̃ = 0, a contradiction. (a) is proved.
11.12. Let s = (Jn , Jn′ , un )n≥0 ∈ S(J, Ad(y)δ). For r ≫ 0 we have Jr = Jr′ =

a simple perverse sheaf on UP \Ayr (P, P )/UP via the obvious isomorphism C s −→

there is a well defined simple perverse sheaf X ′ on G×P (UP \Ayr (P, P )/UP ) (with

Let A be a simple perverse sheaf on ZJ,y,δ such that A ⊣ (Πw,y )! L̃|ZJ,y,δ
                                                                      s     . Then
 ′     ′  s
A ∈ CJ,y,δ .
   More generally, we show that the lemma holds when J, s are replaced by Jn , sn
for any n ≥ 0. First we show:
   (a) if the result is true for n = 1 then it is true for n = 0.

(see the last sentence in 11.8). By the change of basis theorem, the direct image
                                     ′ s
with compact support of L̃ under y Yw,y  −   s
                                          → ZJ,y,δ is ϑ∗ (ϑ as in 8.19) of the direct
image with compact support of L̃′ under

                           z −1 y

In other words,

                (Πw,y )! L̃|ZJ,y,δ
                             s     = ϑ∗ ((Πδ−1 (b′ ),az,z −1 y )! L̃′ |Z s1                        ).
                                                                                    J1 ,z −1 y,δ
22                                            G. LUSZTIG

Thus, A′ ⊣ ϑ∗ ((Πδ−1 (b′ ),az,z −1 y )! L̃′ |Z s1                ). Since ϑ is an affine space bun-
                                                  J1 ,z −1 y,δ

dle it follows that there exists a simple perverse sheaf A′′ on ZJs11 ,z −1 y,δ such
that A′ = ϑ̃(A′′ ) and A′′ ⊣ (Πδ−1 (b′ ),az,z −1 y )! L̃′ |Z s1                     . Applying 11.11(a) for
                                                                     J1 ,z −1 y,δ

δ −1 (b′ ), az, z −1 y, s1 instead of x1 , x2 , y, s we see that there exists x0 ∈ W such
that x0 z −1 y ∈ WL1′ and A′′ ⊣ ((Πx0 ,y L̃′ )|Z s1 −1 . By our assumption we have
                                                           J1 ,z    y,δ

A ∈     CJ′ 1 ,z −1 y,δ s1 .
                    From the definitions we have ϑ̃(A′′ ) ∈ CJ,y,δ
                                                             ′     s
                                                                     . Thus, (a) holds.
   Similarly, if the result holds for some n ≥ 1 then it holds for n − 1. (The
proof is the same as for n = 1.) In this way we see that it suffices to prove the
result for n ≫ 0. Thus we may assume that J0 = J0′ = J1 = J1′ = · · · = J and
                                                                ′ s
u0 = u1 = · · · = 1. Then WJ y = yWδ(J) . In our case, y Yw,y          6= ∅ hence there
exist B0 , B1 ∈ B such that pos(B0 , B1 ) = w and B0 , B1 are contained in the same
parabolic of type J. Thus we have w ∈ WJ . Let P ∈ PJ with T ⊂ P . Let L be
the Levi of P such that T ⊂ L. Then

                               C = {c ∈ G1 ; c L = L, pos(P, c P ) = y}

is a connected component of NĜ (L). Let Y ′ be the set of all (β0 , β1 , c) where
β, β ′ are Borels of L such that pos(β0 , β1 ) = w (position with respect to L with
Weyl group WJ ) and c ∈ C is such that c β0 = β1 . Then P acts on Y ′ by
p : (β0 , β1 , c) 7→ (l β0 , l β1 , l c) where l ∈ L, p ∈ lUP . We have a commutative
diagram

with B0 = β0 UP , B1 = β1 UP , the lower horizontal map is

                                  (g, c) 7→ (g P, g P, UP gcg −1 UP ),

the left vertical map is (g, β0 , β1 , c) 7→ (g, c) and the right vertical map is Πw,y .
This commutative diagram shows that any composition factor of ⊕i p H i ((Πw,y )! L̃)
is of the form X ′ (notation of 11.12) where X is a character sheaf on C; hence it
       ′     s

composition factor of ⊕i H (A ) belongs to CJ,y,δ .
     We can find L ∈ S(T ) and x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xr ) as in 11.1(b) such that x1 x2 . . . xr ∈

we have K̄xL ∼ = A[m] ⊕ K ′ for some K ′ ∈ D(ZJ,y,δ ) and some m ∈ z. Hence

   Since ZJ,y,δ = ⊔J⊂I ZJ,y,δ , we can find s ∈ S(J, Ad(y)δ) such that supp(A) ∩

 s                                               s    is a simple perverse sheaf on

L ∈ S(T ) (see 11.8). Using the change basis theorem for the cartesian diagram in
11.10 we deduce that X0′ ⊣ (Πayb′ y−1 ,y )! L̃|ZJ,y,δ

    The same argument shows that, if the result holds for some n ≥ 1 then it also
holds for n − 1. In this way it suffices to show that the result holds for n ≫ 0.
Replacing s, n by sn , 0, we may assume that J0 = J0′ = J1 = J1′ = · · · = J,
u0 = u1 = · · · = 1 and n = 0. Let P, L be as in 11.13. We can find w ∈ WJ
such that X ⊣ (pr3 )! L̃ where pr3 : Y ′ −     → C is defined with Y ′ as in 11.13 in
terms of w; here L ∈ S(T ) and L̃ is the corresponding local system on Y ′ . Using
the commutative diagram in 11.13 we see that X ′ ⊣ (Πyb′ y−1 ,y )! L̃|ZJ,y,δ        s     where
b′ = y −1 wy ∈ Wδ(J) and L̃ is the local system on y Yw,y

yb′−1 y −1 ∈ WJ ′ . Hence

exists                                           −1
                             (B̃0 , B̃1 , γ̃) ∈ z y Yδ′−1 (b′ )az,z −1 y
such that
                          Πδ−1 (b′ )az,z −1 y (B̃0 , B̃1 , γ̃) = (P1 , P1′ , γ1 ).
We have δ −1 (b′−1 ) ∈ WJ∞ ⊂ WJ1 hence

     pos(P1′ , P1 ) = min(WJ1′ pos(B̃1 , B̃0 )WJ1 ) = min(WJ1′ z −1 a−1 δ −1 (b′−1 )WJ1 ) =
      min(WJ1′ u−1
                0 a
                    −1
                       WJ1 ) = u1 .

Now δ −1 (b′ )az = (az)(z −1 y)b′1 (y −1 z) where b′1 = (ay)−1 δ −1 (b′ )ay ∈ Wδ(J∞ ) (see
2.6). Hence in the previous argument we may replace B0 , B1 , γ, P, P ′, a, y, b′ by
B̃0 , B̃1 , γ̃, P1 , P1′ , au0 , u−1    ′                                    ′                ′
                                  0 y, b1 and we see that the image (P2 , P2 , γ2 ) of (P1 , P1 , γ1 )
under ZJ1 ,u−1 y,δ;u1 −       → ZJ2 ,u−1 u−1 y,δ satisfies pos(P2′ , P2 ) = u2 . Continuing this
                 0                      1  0
process we find that (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ    s
                                                  . The lemma is proved.

Lemma 11.18. If A ∈ CJ,y,δ then A ∈ CJ,y,δ .

   Let s, X̃, X̂ be as in the proof of Lemma 11.16. We may assume that A = X̂.
By Lemma 11.16 we have X̃ ⊣ (Πayb′ y−1 ,y )! L̃|ZJ,y,δ     s      where a = a0 (see 11.16),

                                                                           s
                                                                        → ZJ,y,δ and X̃ = Π′! L̃.
Thus there exists a simple perverse sheaf on ZJ,y,δ whose support is the closure
                                                     s
in ZJ,y,δ of supp(X̃), whose restriction to ZJ,y,δ        is X̃ and which is a composition
factor of ⊕i p H i ((Πayb′ y−1 ,y )! L̃); this is necessarily X̂. We see that X̂ ∈ CJ,y,δ .
The lemma is proved.
11.19. For P ∈ PJ let HP be the inverse image of the connected centre of P/UP
under P −→ P/UP . For P, P̃ ∈ PJ , the groups HP /UP , HP̃ /UP̃ are canonically
isomorphic (an element h ∈ G that conjugates P into P̃ induces an isomorphism
         ∼
HP /UP −→ HP̃ /UP̃ that is independent of the choice of h). Thus we may identify
the groups HP /UP (with P ∈ PJ ) with a single torus ∆J independent of P . Now
∆J acts (freely) on ZJ,y,δ by δ : (P, P ′ , γ) 7→ (P, P ′ , γz) where z ∈ HP represents
                         s
δ ∈ ∆J and each piece ZJ,y,δ  is ∆J -stable. We set

                     s            s                                   s

                                         s
The action of G on ZJ,y,δ and on ZJ,y,δ        commutes with the action of ∆J and
                                              s
induces an action of G on Z̄J,y,δ and on Z̄J,y,δ .
   For (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ we have naturally

                    HP /UP ⊂ HP1 /UP1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ HPr /UPr ⊂ . . .

hence we may identify ∆J with a (closed) subgroup of the centre of Ls (as above).
The bijection 8.21(a) induces a bijection

(b)                G\Z̄J,y,δ ↔ ⊔s∈S(J,Ad(y)δ) (Ls /∆J )\(C s /∆J ).

Here C s /∆J is the orbit space for the free action of ∆J by right translation on C s
(restriction of the action of the centre of Ls by right translation) and the action
of Ls /∆J on C s /∆J is induced by the conjugation action of Ls on C s .

                                  12. Completion
12.1. Assume that P, P ′ are two parabolics of G (as in 0.1) and that Φ : P/UP −    →

P /UP ′ is an isomorphism of algebraic groups. Let HP,P ′ be the set of all (f, f ) ∈
P × P ′ such that Φ carries the image of f in P/UP to the image of f ′ in P ′ /UP ′ .
           Φ
Clearly, HP,P  ′ is a closed connected subgroup of G × G of dimension dim UP +

dim UP ′ + dim(P/UP ) = dim G and P, P ′ , Φ can be reconstructed from HP,P  Φ
                                                                                 ′.

    Let VG be the (projective) variety whose points are the dim(G)-dimensional Lie
                                             Φ
subalgebras of Lie (G × G). We have Lie HP,P    ′ ∈ VG .


12.2. Assume now that we are in the setup of 3.1. Let J, J ′ , y be as in 8.8. For
                                                     ∼
(P, P ′ , γ) ∈ ZJ,y,δ we set Φγ = ba−1 Ad(g) : P/UP −→ P ′ /UP ′ where g ∈ γ and
a, b are the obvious isomorphisms in
                     Ad(g)             a                        b

12.3. In the remainder of this section we assume that G is adjoint. Recall that
two parabolics Q, Q′ of G are said to be opposed if their intersection is a common
Levi of Q, Q′ . (We then write Q ⊲⊳ Q′ .) If B ∈ B and Q is a parabolic in G, we
write B ⋉ Q if B is opposed to some Borel of Q.
   Let J ⊂ I. Define J ∗ ⊂ I by {Q; Q ⊲⊳ P for some P ∈ PJ } = PJ ∗ . Let yJ be
the longest element in W δ(J) . If (P, P ′ , g) ∈ PJ × Pδ(J)∗ × G1 , then P ′ ⊲⊳ g P if
and only if g ∈ AyJ (P, P ′ ) (see 3.8). Let

         G1J = {(P, P ′ , µ); P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ Pδ(J)∗ , µ ∈ ĀyJ (P, P ′ )} = Z̄J,yJ ,δ ,
                                       Ḡ1 = ⊔J⊂I G1J .
(notation of 11.19(a)). We define a structure of algebraic variety on Ḡ1 . We
identify G1J with a subvariety of VG by 12.2(a). Since G is adjoint we have G1I = G1 .
By [DP], Ḡ1 is the closure of G1I = G1 in VG , so that Ḡ1 is a projective variety.
(In [DP] it is assumed that G = G1 but the general case can be easily reduced
to this special case; in fact, Ḡ1 is isomorphic to the analogous variety in the case
G = G1 .) We have a partition

                            Ḡ1 = ⊔J⊂I ⊔s∈S(J,Ad(yJ )δ) Z̄J,y
                                                          s
                                                             J ,δ


(see 11.19(a)) refining the partition Ḡ1 = ⊔J⊂I Γ1J . Putting together the bijections
11.19(b) we obtain a canonical bijection

(a)               G\Ḡ1 ↔ ⊔J⊂I ⊔s∈S(J,Ad(yJ )δ) (Ls /∆J )\(C s /∆J ).

Here the action of G on Ḡ1 is the extension of the conjugation action of G on G1
and (Ls /∆J )\(C s /∆J ) is as in 11.19.
    Let J ⊂ I, s ∈ S(J, Ad(yJ )δ) and let X be a character sheaf on C s that is
equivariant for the free action of ∆J by right translation. The simple perverse
               s
sheaf X̃ on ZJ,y J ,δ
                      (see 11.12) is ∆J -equivariant hence it is a shift of the inverse
                                                           s
image of a well defined simple perverse sheaf X̃ on Z̄J,y     J ,δ
                                                                    under the canonical
        s
map ZJ,yJ ,δ −→ Z̄J,yJ ,δ . Let X̂ be the simple perverse sheaf on Ḡ1 whose support
                   s

is the closure in Ḡ1 of suppX̃ and whose restriction to Z̄J,y
                                                             s
                                                                 J ,δ
                                                                      is X̃.
    The character sheaves on Ḡ are by definition the simple perverse sheaves on Ḡ1
                                  1

of the form X̂ with X as above. The character sheaves on Ḡ1 are in bijection with
the set of triples (J, s, X) where J ⊂ I, s ∈ S(J, Ad(yJ )δ) and X is a character
sheaf on C s that is equivariant for the free action of ∆J by right translation.
12.4. We now give another definition of a structure of algebraic variety on the set
Ḡ1 which does not use VG . For B, B̃ ∈ B and J ⊂ I, let

              G1,B,

where g ∈ µ (an open subset of G1J ). By the the substitution (P, P ′ , µ) 7→
(B1 , B1′ , µ) where B1 = P B̃ , B1′ = P ′B , we may identify G1,B,  J
                                                                         B̃
                                                                             with the set of
all triples (B1 , B1′ , µ) where B1 , B1′ ∈ B, pos(B, B1′ ) = yJ ∗ , pos(B̃, B1 ) = yδ−1 (J) ,
µ ∈ ĀyJ (P, P ′ ) (with P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ Pδ(J)∗ defined by B1 ⊂ P, B1′ ⊂ P ′ ) and
g

that
   (a) ρ∅ is a principal B̃/UB̃ -bundle.
We fix (B1 , B1′ ) ∈ G1,B,
                      ∅
                           B̃
                              . Let F = ρ−1          ′                         ′
                                           ∅ (B1 , B1 ). Since B1 ⊲⊳ B̃ and B1 ⊲⊳ B, we
can find g0 ∈ G such that g0 B1 = B, g0 B̃ = B1′ . Next we can find g1 ∈ G1 such
                                           −1             −1
that g1 B = B, g1 B1′ = B1′ . We have g1 g0 B1 = B, g1 g0 B̃ = B1′ . Hence g1−1 g0 ∈ F
and F 6= ∅.
    We show that F is a free homogeneous B̃/UB̃ -space. Since B̃ ⊲⊳ B1 , we have
canonically B̃/UB̃ = B̃ ∩ B1 . It suffices to show that F is a free homogeneous
B̃ ∩ B1 -space. Now B̃ ∩ B1 acts freely on F by t : g 7→ gt. Let g, g ′ ∈ F . Since
g −1       ′−1                                                                    ′
     B = g B and g ′ g −1 ∈ G, we have g ′ = bg where b ∈ B. Since g B̃ = g B̃ and
                                                                         −1    −1
g −1 g ′ ∈ G, we have g ′ = g b̃ where b̃ ∈ B̃. We have b̃ = g −1 g ′ = g b ∈ g B = B1 .
Thus, b̃ ∈ B̃ ∩ B1 . This proves (a).
    Similarly,
    (b) ρJ is a principal HP̃J /UP̃J -bundle. (P̃J is as above.)
Using simple roots we identify B̃/UB̃ = (k∗ )I (we use again that G is adjoint).
Now (k∗ )I acts on kI by multiplication on each factor. This may be regarded as
an action of B̃/UB̃ on kI . Using the principal B̃/UB̃ -bundle ρ∅ we may form the
associated bundle

                                        ∅
                                           B̃
                                              ). Now X B,B̃ is an affine space of di-
mension dim(G). We have an obvious partition kI = ⊔J⊂I (k∗ )J and each piece is
B̃/UB̃ -stable. Hence there is a partition

                                    X B,B̃ = ⊔J⊂I XJB,B̃

where XJB,B̃ = G1,B,
                I
                     B̃
                        ×B̃/U (k∗ )J . We may identify XJB,B̃ with the orbit space
                               B̃

of G1,B,
     I
         B̃
              by HP̃J /UP̃J , hence (using (b)) with G1,B,
                                                      J
                                                           B̃
                                                              . Thus, we may identify
X B,B̃
      with the subset of ⊔J⊂I G1J so that X B,B̃ ∩ G1J = G1,B,
                                                          J
                                                               B̃

Let (P, P ′ , µ) ∈ G1J , g ∈ µ. Since g P ⊲⊳ P ′ , we can find Borels B1 ⊂ P, B1′ ⊂ P ′
such that g B1 ⊲⊳ B1′ . We can find B ∈ B such that B ⋉ P ′ and P ′B = B1′ . We can
find B̃ ∈ B such that B̃ ⋉ P and P B̃ = B1 . Then (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ G1,B,
                                                                     J
                                                                        B̃
                                                                           . This proves
(c).
   From (c) we deduce

(d)                                     Ḡ1 = ∪B,B̃∈B X B,B̃ .

We can now define a structure of algebraic variety on Ḡ1 by declaring that X B,B̃
is an open subvariety of Ḡ1 for any B, B̃ ∈ B. We see that Ḡ1 has a covering by
open subsets isomorphic to the affine space of dimension dim(G).
12.5. Let V = {(B, B ′ , g) ∈ B × B × G1 ; B ′ ⊲⊳ g B}. The fibre of pr12 : V −→ B×B
        ′           1,B ′ ,B
at (B, B ) is just GI        . There is a unique free action of the torus ∆∅ (see 11.19)
                                  ′
on V whose restriction to GI1,B ,B is the action of ∆∅ = B/UB appearing in 12.4(a).
By 12.4(a), this makes V into a principal ∆∅ -bundle over

(a)                        {(B, B ′ , B1 , B1′ ) ∈ B4 ; B1 ⊲⊳ B, B1′ ⊲⊳ B ′ }.

As in 12.4, we form the associated bundle

                                           X = V ×∆∅ kI
                                                                                  ′
(a kI -bundle over (a)). For (B, B ′ ) ∈ B × B, the inclusion GI1,B ,B ⊂ V gives rise
                      ′                                      ′
to an inclusion G1,B ,B ×∆∅ kI ⊂ V ×∆∅ kI that is, X B ,B ⊂ X. The subsets
    ′
X B ,B form a partition of X. Let π : X −  → Ḡ1 be the morphism which induces for
                                ′           ′
any B, B ′ the identity map X B ,B −  → X B ,B . We have a partition

                                            X = ⊔J⊂I XJ

where XJ = VI ×∆∅ (k∗ )J . We may identify XJ with the orbit space of X by
∆I−J hence, using 12.4(b), with the set of all quintuples (B1 , B1′ , B, B ′ , µ) where

     (B, B ′ , B1 , B1′ ) ∈ B4 , pos(B ′ , B1′ ) = yJ ∗ , pos(B, B1 ) = yδ−1 (J) , µ ∈ ĀyJ (P, P ′ )

(with P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ Pδ(J)∗ defined by B1 ⊂ P, B1′ ⊂ P ′ ) and g B1 ⊲⊳ B1′ for
some/any g ∈ µ. Now π : X −             → Ḡ1 restricts to the map XJ −
                                                                      → G1J given by
(B1 , B1′ , B, B ′, µ) 7→ (P, P ′ , µ) (with P, P ′ as above).
  For w ∈ W we set V w = {(B, B ′ , g) ∈ V ; pos(B, B ′ ) = w}, X w = V w ×∆∅ kI .
The sets XJw = X w ∩ XJ form a partition of X. If (B1 , B1′ , B, B ′ , µ) ∈ XJw , then

      pos(B1 , B) = yδ−1                ′            ′   ′                 ′ g
                       −1 (J) , pos(B, B ) = w, pos(B , B1 ) = yJ ∗ , pos(B1 , B1 ) = y∅

for g ∈ µ. Hence (B1 , B, B ′, B1′ , g B1 , g) ∈ Yx where x = (yδ−1     −1 (J) , w, yJ ∗ , y∅ ) (see

4.2).
   Let Yx be the set of all (β0 , β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 , γ) where (β0 , β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 ) ∈ B5 and
γ ∈ UP ′ \AyJ (P, P ′ )/UP (with P ∈ PJ , P ′ ∈ Pδ(J)∗ defined by β0 ⊂ P, β3 ⊂ P ′ )
are such that (β0 , β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 , g) ∈ Yx for some/any g ∈ γ.
   The obvious map Yx −      → Yx is an affine space bundle. The obvious map Yx −                 →
XJw is a principal ∆δ(J) -bundle. Let L ∈ S(T ) be such that yδ−1          −1 (J)  wy   ∗
                                                                                      J ∅ y  ∈  W  1
                                                                                                   L
and such that the associated local system L̃ on Yx is the inverse image under the
composition Yx − → Yx − → XJw of a local system L̃0 on XJw . (In any case, L̃ is the
inverse image under Yx − → Yx of a well defined local system on Yx and we require
that this last local system is ∆δ(J) -equivariant.) Let KL w,J be the direct image
                                       w      1
with compact support of L̃0 under XJ −   → Ḡ (restriction of π : X −  → Ḡ1 ).
                                                           1
   We give a second definition of character sheaves on Ḡ as the simple perverse
sheaves on Ḡ1 which are composition factors of ⊕i p H i (KLw,J ) for some w, J, L as
above. We expect that this coincides with the definition in 12.3.
12.6. There is a unique simple perverse sheaf S on G1 such that:
   (a) S is a direct summand of the perverse sheaf (pr1 )! Q̄l [dim G] where pr1 :
{(g, B) ∈ G1 × B; g B = B} −    → G1 is the first projection (a small map);
   (b) if J $ I, δ(J) = J, then S is not a direct summand of the perverse sheaf
(pr1 )! Q̄l [dim G] where pr1 : {(g, P ) ∈ G1 × PJ ; g P = P } −
                                                               → G1 is the first projec-
tion (a small map).
Let S̃ be the simple perverse sheaf on Ḡ1 such that S̃|G1 = S. For x ∈ Ḡ1 let Gx
be the stabilizer of x in G and let Hxi (S̃) be the stalk at x of the i-th cohomology
sheaf of S̃.
   We conjecture that the following three conditions on x ∈ Ḡ1 are equivalent:
   (c) Hxi (S̃) 6= 0 for some i;
   (d) i dim Hxi (S̃) = 1;
         P
   (e) Gx is a reductive group.
If we assume that x ∈ G1 , then the equivalence of (c),(d),(e) is known.
12.7. A difficulty in proving the conjecture in 12.6 is that the small map in 12.6(a)
does not seem to extend to a small map over all of Ḡ1 . There is one case when
such an extension exists (partially). Assume that G = G1 = P GL(V ) where V is
a k-vector space of dimension d ≥ 2. Let

                          Y = {τ ∈ End(V ); dim ker(τ ) ≤ 1}/k∗

where k∗ acts by scalar multiplication. For τ as above let τ̄ be the image of τ in
Y . Let Y0 = {τ ∈ End(V ); dim ker(τ ) = 1}/k∗ . We may identify Y with an open
subset of Ḡ1 so that Y −Y0 corresponds to the open stratum G1 and Y0 corresponds
to a codimension 1 stratum G1J0 . Let Ỹ be the set of all (τ̄ , V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Vd )
where τ̄ ∈ Y and V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Vd are subspaces of V (dim Vi = i) such
that τ (Vi ) ⊂ Vi for all i. Then Ỹ is smooth and pr1 : Ỹ − → Y is a small map.

Its restriction to pr1−1 (G) may be identified with the small map in 12.6(a). Let
K∅ = (pr1 )! Q̄l [dim G], a perverse sheaf on Y . More generally, for any J ⊂ I we
have a perverse sheaf KJ on Y defined like K∅ but using flags of type J (see 8.24)
in V instead of complete flags. Let S̃′ = S̃|Y that is, the simple perverse sheaf
on Y such that S̃′ |G = S. Now S is an alternating sum over J of the perverse
sheaves KJ |G ; hence S̃′ is an alternating sum over J of the perverse sheaves KJ .
Using this, one can compute explicitly the stalks of the cohomology sheaves of S̃′
at any x ∈ Y0 . Thus one can verify that the conjecture in 12.6 holds in our case
for x ∈ Y0 .
