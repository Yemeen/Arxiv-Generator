                                                      of nonsymmetric Jack polynomials.

                                  1. Introduction
    Let V be a finite dimensional Hilbert space. A finite complex reflection group in
the unitary group U (V ) is a finite subgroup which is generated by pseudo-reflections
(or “complex reflections”), transformations with all eigenvalues but one equal to
unity. In this paper we introduce for each such group a commutative algebra
of parameterized operators Ti (k) generalizing the partial derivatives ∂i = Ti (0).
Here k denotes an N -tuple of complex parameters where N equals the number of
conjugacy classes of complex reflections in the group.
    We prove the commutativity by showing that the perturbed De Rham complex,
in which the role of the partial derivatives is played by the operators Ti (k), is
indeed a complex (i.e. the perturbed differential d(k) satisfies d(k)2 = 0). At
the heart of this argument lies the computation of a “Laplacian” E(k) for this
complex. This operator gives rise to a parameter family of elements in the center
of the group algebra, whose values on the irreducible representations of G are
nonnegative integral linear combinations of the parameters k. These values seem
to govern many of the properties of the operators Ti (k). In particular, analyzing
these values easily leads to a proof of the commutativity of the Ti (k).
    In the course of this argument various natural structures arise:
                                                V• ∗
   (i) The perturbed De Rham complex P ⊗           (V ) with differential d(k), where
       P is the ring of polynomials on V .
  (ii) Homogeneous, G-equivariant intertwining operators V(k) on P , such that
       ∂i V(k) = V(k)Ti (k).
 (iii) An hermitian pairing (·, ·)k on P such that (xi p, q)k = (p, Ti (k)q)k .
 (iv) The ring P as a module over the “rational Cherednik algebra” A(k), the
       algebra generated by C[G], Ti (k) and P (acting on itself by multiplication).

A parameter value k is called singular if there exists a nonzero homogeneous poly-
nomial p of positive degree such that for all i, Ti (k)p = 0. This turns out to be
the only obstruction for the existence of a homogeneous equivariant intertwining
isomorphism as in (ii). By this remark it is easy to see that k is singular if and
only if there exists an i > 0 such that the cohomology group H i (k) of the De Rham
complex with differential d(k) is nonzero. Another equivalent formulation is the
statement that (·, ·)k is degenerate. From this one easily sees that k is singular if
and only if P is not irreducible as an A(k)-module.
   By these equivalent descriptions it is clear that the set of singular parameter
values is of fundamental importance, and one of the goals of this paper is to find
this set explicitly. We are not able to solve this problem in general, but we will derive
that the singular set is always a locally finite union of affine rational hyperplanes
in the parameter space.
   In the case of a Coxeter group one knows more about the above structures, and
this was described in the paper [8]. The present paper grew out of an attempt to
apply the methods discussed in [8] to the case of complex reflection groups.
   The complex reflection groups were classified by Shephard and Todd [18]. There
are 34 exceptional cases called Gi , i = 4, .., 37 (containing the exceptional real
reflection groups) and an infinite family of groups G(m, p, N ) with m, p, N ∈ N and
p|m. The group G (m, p, N ) is a subgroup of U (N ) and consists of permutation
matrices whose nonzero entries are mth roots of unity and the product of the nonzero
                     th
entries is an (m/p) root of unity. If N = 1 we take p = 1 (cyclic groups of order

m acting on C). The groups G (1, 1, N ) , G (2, 1, N ) , G (2, 2, N ) are the Coxeter
groups of types AN −1 , BN , DN respectively.
   The infinite family G (m, p, N ) is studied in detail in the second half of this paper,
by means of the theory of nonsymmetric Jack polynomials. A complete orthogonal
decomposition for the pairing associated with G (m, p, N ) is obtained with explicit
norm formulae. This leads to a precise description of the set of singular values
and the construction of shift operators which transform between the structures for
contiguous parameter values.
   Various alternative interpretations are known for the singular parameter set in
the case of Coxeter groups (see also [8]). It is closely related to the non-semisimple
specializations of Hecke algebras (see [15]). Likewise it is closely related to the
zeroes of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of the discriminant (see [14]). In this
regard it is also interesting to compare with the results of the paper [2]. It is an
interesting question whether some of these interpretations survive in the general
case of complex reflection groups. The Hecke algebras to be considered are the
topological cyclotomic Hecke algebras studied in [1] (also [17]).
   We note that the algebra A(k) naturally fits in the framework of the symplectic
reflection algebras that were recently introduced by Etingof and Ginsburg [10]. As
is mentioned in that paper, this provides an alternative proof of the commutativity
of the operators Ti (k). Yet another approach to the proof of the commutativity is to
show the integrability of the related Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection directly,
using geometric arguments along the lines of [13] (see [1] for the details of this
argument).

           2. Dunkl operators for complex reflection groups
2.1. Complex reflection groups. Let V be a finite dimensional Hilbert space,
and let U (V ) be the group of unitary linear transformations of V . An element
g ∈ U (V ) is called a complex reflection if g has finite order and Hg := Ker(g − Id) is
a hyperplane in V . A finite subgroup G ⊂ U (V ) is called a finite complex reflection
group if G is generated by complex reflections.
   Let G ⊂ U (V ) be a finite complex reflection group. If W ⊂ V is a linear
subspace, we denote by GW ⊂ G the subgroup of those elements of G which fix
the elements of W . By a well known result of Steinberg [19], GW is itself a finite
complex reflection group. Clearly, GW acts faithfully on W ⊥ . In particular, if
H ⊂ V is a hyperplane, then GH is a cyclic group. If GH 6= {Id} we call H
a reflection hyperplane. When H is a reflection hyperplane, we denote by eH the
order of the cyclic group GH . The collection of all reflection hyperplanes is a central
hyperplane arrangement A in V , on which the group G acts. Let us denote by C
the set of G-orbits in A. Obviously, eH only depends on the orbit C = G · H ∈ C.
We will write eC instead of eH whenever this is convenient.
   Let det be the determinant character on U (V ). When H ⊂ V is a reflection hy-
perplane, the characters of GH also form a cyclic group, generated by the restriction
4                           C.F. DUNKL AND E.M. OPDAM


χH of det to GH . We will thus label the character group of GH by
                                  −i
(1)                       ĜH = {χH  | i = 0, . . . , eH − 1}.
For each of the reflection hyperplanes we choose a functional αH ∈ V ∗ such that
Ker(αH ) = H.
    The group G acts on the ring P of polynomials on V in the usual way, i.e.
pg (x) := p(g −1 x). The functional αH transforms under the action of GH according
to the character χ−1  H . A polynomial p which transforms under the action of GH
according to a nontrivial character must vanish on H. Consequently, a polynomial
which transforms under the action of GH according to χ−i H with i ∈ {1, . . . , eH − 1}
is divisible by αiH .
2.2. Dunkl operators. Given H ∈ A and i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , eH − 1}, let
                              1 X i
(2)                  ǫH,i :=       χH (g)g ∈ C[GH ],
                             eH
                                     g∈GH

be the idempotent of C[GH ] of the character χ−i     H . In addition, choose a list of
complex numbers k = (kC,i ), where C runs over the set of orbits C, and for each
C ∈ C, i ∈ {1, . . . , eC − 1}. With these data we form, for each reflection hyperplane
H, the element
                                      eX
                                       H −1

(3)                   aH = aH (k) =           eH kH,i ǫH,i ∈ C[GH ].
                                       i=1

Notice that the ǫH,i with i ∈ {1, . . .P
                                       , eH − 1} constitute a basis of P
                                                                       the subalgebra
in C[GH ] consisting of the elements g∈GH cg g ∈ C[GH ] such that        cg = 0. Also
notice that the elements aH are equivariant with respect to conjugation in the group
algebra: for all g ∈ G,
(4)                                gaH g −1 = agH .
   Let ξ ∈ V , and denote by ∂ξ the derivation of P associated to the constant
vector field on V defined by ξ. By what was said above, we can define the following
“Dunkl operator” on P :
                                      X
(5)                     Tξ (k) = ∂ξ +    αH (ξ)α−1
                                                 H aH (k),
                                       H∈A

where aH (k) is considered as operator acting on P . The operator indeed maps
polynomials to polynomials, since ǫH,0 aH = 0, so that we can divide by αH after
applying aH (k). The next proposition is now clear:
Proposition 2.1. (i) The operator Tξ (k) does not depend on the choice of the
      functionals αH .
 (ii) Tξ (k) is equivariant with respect to the action of G on P and V :
(6)                             gTξ (k)g −1 = Tgξ (k).
 (iii) Tξ (k) is homogeneous of degree −1.
                    V• ∗
    Let K • = P ⊗      V denote the algebra of polynomial differential forms on V .
Let Ω(k) ∈ End(P ) ⊗ K 1 be given by
                                       X
(7)                            Ω(k) =      aH (k)ωH ,
                                       H∈A

where ωH := α−1 H dαH is the logarithmic differential of αH (which is independent
of the choice of αH , and GH -invariant).
Lemma 2.2. The operator Ω(k) : P → K 1 is G-equivariant with respect to the
usual action of G on P , and the diagonal action of G on K 1 .
Proof. This is clear since both aH (k) and ωH are equivariant for the natural actions
of G on P and on the space of (rational) 1-forms on V .

We write d(k) : P → K 1 to denote the map d(k)(p) = dp + Ω(k)(p). Thus we have:
(8)                            Tξ (k)(p) = cξ (d(k)(p)),
where cξ denotes the contraction with the constant vector field ξ.VWe extend the
                                                                     • ∗
operator d(k) to K • in the usual way: for all p ∈ P and ω ∈          V we define
                                                              •
d(k)(p ⊗ ω) = d(k)(p) ∧ ω, and extend this linearly to K . Note however that,
unlike the case k = 0, this is not a derivation of the algebra K • .
Lemma 2.3. We have the following equivalent definition of d(k) on K • . Extend
Ω(k)
  P to the G-equivariant endomorphism    Ω(k) on K • which is defined by Ω(k)(ω)
= H∈A aH (k)(ωH ∧ ω) for ω ∈ K , where aH (k) acts diagonally on K • . Then
                                   •

d(k) = d + Ω(k). The operator d(k) is equivariant for the diagonal action of G on
K •.
Proof. If g ∈ GH , then xg ∈ x + CαH , for all x ∈ V ∗ . In addition, ωH is GH -
invariant. Hence if ω = p ⊗ dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxl , then
(9)   (aH (k)(p)) ⊗ ωH ∧ dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxl = aH (k)(p ⊗ ωH ∧ dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxl ),
where we used the diagonal action of G on the right hand side. The equivariance
of d(k) follows from the previous Lemma.

  Consider the Koszul differential ∂ on K • . This differential is defined by:
                     ∂ : K l → K l−1
                                  l
                                  X
        p ⊗ dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxl →                                      dr ∧ · · · ∧ dxl .
                                        (−1)r+1 xr p ⊗ dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dx
                                  r=1

Observe that ∂ is U (V )-equivariant with respect to the diagonal action of U (V ) on
K •.
   Let E(0) denote the Euler vector field on V . This vector field is the infinitesimal
generator of the action of C× on V (by scalar multiplication). Differentiating the
diagonal action of C× on K • we obtain an action of E(0) on K • , the “diagonal
                                                   V
action”. In other words, if we put Km  l
                                          = Pm ⊗ l V ∗ , then E(0) has eigenvalue
           l                       l       l+1                l         l−1
l + m on Km  . Notice that d(k)(Km   ) ⊂ Km−1   and that ∂(Km   ) ⊂ Km+1    .
                                          P
Proposition 2.4. Let E(k) = E(0) + H∈A aH (k), acting diagonally on K • .
Then ∂d(k) + d(k)∂ = E(k).
Proof. It is well known that ∂d(0) + d(0)∂ = E(0), since d(0) is the ordinary De
Rham differential on K • .
                                                   •
  Extend the operators d(k) and ∂ to the complex K of rational differential forms
                                                                      •      •
on V in the natural way. For each H ∈ A, define the operator wH : K → K by
6                            C.F. DUNKL AND E.M. OPDAM


wH (η) := ωH ∧ η. By the previous Lemma and the equivariance of ∂ we have
                               ∂aH wH + aH wH ∂ =
                               aH (∂wH + wH ∂) = aH .
This finishes the proof.
The next Lemma is of crucial importance in all that follows.
                                      P
Lemma 2.5. We put z(k) =                H∈A aH (k) ∈ C[G]. This element of the group
algebra has the following properties:
   (i) The element z(k) is in the center of C[G].
  (ii) For (Vτ , τ ) ∈ Ĝ, let cτ (k) denote the scalar such that z(k) acts on Vτ by mul-
       tiplication with cτ (k). Then cτ (k) is a linear function of k, with nonnegative
       integer coefficients.
 (iii) Let triv denote the trivial representation of G. Then cτ (k) ≡ 0 if and only if
       τ = triv.
Proof. (i) This follows immediately from the equivariance of the elements aH .
  (ii) Let the restriction of τ to GH be
                                              eX
                                               H −1

(10)                             τ |GH =              nτH,i χ−i
                                                             H
                                              i=0

for certain nonnegative integers   nτH,i .
                                    Observe that these branching numbers only
depend on the orbit C = G · H of H. Hence the trace of z(k) on Vτ equals
                                             X eX
                                                H −1

showing that cτ (k) is linear with nonnegative rational numbers as coefficients. On
the other hand, z(k) is a linear expression in the kC,i , with coefficients that are
central elements of the algebra A[G], where A denotes the ring of algebraic integers.
By a well known result in the theory of representations of finite groups, the central
elements of A[G] assume algebraic integer values on the irreducible representations
of G over C. This proves the result.
   (iii) If cτ (k) ≡ 0 then it follows from the proof of (ii) that for each H ∈ A, τ |GH
contains only the trivial character of GH . Since G is generated by the subgroups
GH , this implies that τ = triv.

Corollary 2.6. Let X, Y, Z denote the generators of an associative algebra C̃, sat-
isfying the relations XY + Y X = Z, X 2 = [Z, X] = [Z, Y ] = 0. The map X → ∂,
Y → d(k) and Z → E(k) extends to a representation of C̃ on K • .
                             l                                    l
Proof. If τ ∈ Ĝ, we put Km,τ   for the τ -isotypic component of Km . We have
     l         l−1          l        l+1                       l       l
∂(Km,τ ) ⊂ Km+1,τ , d(k)(Km,τ ) ⊂ Km−1,τ , and finally E(k)(Km,τ ) ⊂ Km,τ . It
also follows immediately that E(k) commutes with ∂ and d(k).
                           l
We put K(r, τ ) := ⊕l+m=r Km,τ , and K(0) = K00 = C.

Corollary 2.7. K(r, τ ) is a finite dimensional C̃-submodule, and K • decomposes
as direct sum K • = ⊕r≥0,τ K(r, τ ).
              DUNKL OPERATORS FOR COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS                          7


  Furthermore we write K • (+) := ⊕r>0,τ K(r, τ ), which is the C̃-submodule of K •
complementary to K(0). We thus have the decomposition K • = K • (+) ⊕ K(0).

Corollary 2.8. Assume that for all τ ∈ Ĝ, −cτ (k) 6∈ N. Then
(12)                Ker(d(k)) ∩ K • (+) = Ker(d(k)) ∩ Im(d(k)).
In particular, Ker(d(k)) ∩ K 0 (+) = {0}.
Proof. E(k) acts by scalar multiplication with r + cτ (k) on the submodule K(r, τ ).
Therefore, by the above assumption, E(k) is invertible on each C̃-submodule K(r, τ ),
with the exception of K(0). Write E(k)−1 for the inverse of E(k) on K • (+). Let
ω ∈ Ker(d(k)) ∩ K • (+), then
                           ω = E(k)−1 E(k)(ω)
                             = E(k)−1 (∂d(k) + d(k)∂)(ω)
                             = d(k)(∂(E(k)−1 ω)).


This shows that η = ∂(E(k)−1 ω) ∈ K • (+) is a solution of d(k)(η) = ω, proving the
desired result.

Theorem 2.9. Assume that for all τ ∈ Ĝ, −cτ (k) 6∈ N. We call a linear operator
V : K • → K • completely homogeneous if V(Kml
                                              ) ⊂ Kml
                                                      , for all l, m. There exists
a unique completely homogeneous linear map V(k) : K → K • such that
                                                    •

  (i) V(k) is the identity operator on K(0) =VC,
                                               • ∗
 (ii) V(k)(p ⊗ ω) = (V(k)p) ⊗ ω, for all ω ∈     V = K0• , and
(iii) d(k)V(k) = V(k)d(0).
Moreover, V(k) is a G-equivariant linear isomorphism.
Proof. First we show that if V(k) exists, it is necessarily a linear isomorphism. If
                                                                       •
not, let m be minimal such that V(k) has a nontrivial kernel in Km       . By (ii) this
implies that Pm ∩ Ker(V(k)) 6= 0, and by (i) we see that m > 0. Let 0 6= p ∈ Pm
be such that V(k)p = 0. By (iii) we see V(k)d(0)p = 0. By the assumption on m
this implies that d(0)p = 0, and since m > 0 this is a contradiction. Note that this
argument is independent of the assumption on k, since it only uses that d(0)p = 0
implies that p = 0 if p ∈ Pm with m > 0.
    A similar argument shows that V(k) must be unique. If not, there exists a
nonzero completely homogeneous operator W satisfying (ii) and (iii) but with
W(K0• ) = 0. Let m > 0 be minimal such that W(Km        •
                                                          ) 6= 0. By (ii) this implies
that W(Pm ) 6= 0. Let p ∈ Pm such that Wp 6= 0. But then d(k)Wp = Wd(0)p = 0,
which implies that Wp ∈ Ker(d(k)) ∩ K 0 (+). Given the assumption on k, this
contradicts Corollary 2.8.
    We now construct V(k) by induction on the degree m. Suppose that m > 0 and
that we have already constructed V(k) on Ki• for i < m, satisfying (i), (ii) and (iii).
           0
Let p ∈ Km   = Pm . Then d(k)(V(k)d(0)p) = 0, and thus, by the previous corollary,
there exists a unique q ∈ Pm such that d(k)q = V(k)d(0)p. Hence we define
V(k)p = q. For any ω ∈ K0 and p ∈ Pm we now put V(k)(p ⊗ ω) = (V(k)p) ⊗ ω,
                                  •
and use this to define V(k) on Km   . It is immediate that V(k) satisfies (i), (ii) and
(iii).

   The G-equivariance of V(k) now follows from the equivariance of d(0) and d(k).
The equivariance implies that for any g ∈ G, g ◦ V(k) ◦ g −1 also meets the re-
quirements (i), (ii) and (iii). By the uniqueness property we conclude that V(k) =
g ◦ V(k) ◦ g −1 .

Corollary 2.10. The map d(k) is a differential on K • , i.e. d(k)2 = 0. In addi-
tion, the complex (K • (+), d(k)) (with K • (+) := ⊕r>0,τ K(r, τ )) is acyclic (i.e. its
cohomology is 0) if we assume that for all τ ∈ Ĝ, −cτ (k) 6∈ N.

Corollary 2.11. The representation of C̃ on the submodule K(r, τ ) (in which Z =
E(k) acts by scalar multiplication with s := r + cτ (k)) factors through the Clifford
algebra C(s), the associative algebra with generators X and Y , and relations XY +
Y X = s, X 2 = Y 2 = 0.
The next reformulation is the main result of this section:
Theorem 2.12. For all ξ, η ∈ V , Tξ (k)Tη (k) = Tη (k)Tξ (k).
Proof. Choose a basis ei of V , with dual basis xj of V ∗ . Put Ti = Tei (k). A simple
direct computation shows that for all p ∈ P ,
                                X
(13)                d(k)2 p =      (Ti Tj − Tj Ti )p ⊗ dxi ∧ dxj .
                                i<j

Hence the statement d(k)2 = 0 is equivalent to the commutativity of the Ti .

Corollary 2.13. The restriction of V(k) to P satisfies Tξ (k)V(k) = V(k)∂ξ .
Proof. The point is that, because of defining property (ii) of V(k), V(k) commutes
with the contraction cξ for each ξ ∈ V . Thus we obtain:
                      Tξ (k)V(k)p = cξ (d(k)V(k)p)
                                   = cξ (V(k)d(0)p) = V(k)∂ξ p.




   When s := r + cτ (k) 6= 0, the Clifford algebra C(s) is semisimple and has only
one irreducible module M s ≃ C2 , with basis a, b such that
                                                  
                                  0 0            0 s
(14)                       X=             ,Y =          .
                                  1 0            0 0
Thus K(r, τ ) is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the irreducible representa-
tion τ ⊗ M s of C[G] ⊗ C(s). The “cohomology” H(τ ⊗ M s ) := Ker(Y )/ Im(Y ) is
equal to 0 in the module τ ⊗ M s . However, the algebra C(0) is the Grassmann
algebra. This algebra is no longer semisimple. The space of equivalence classes of
indecomposable modules of the Grassmann algebra is complicated, and the “coho-
mology” Ker(Y )/ Im(Y ) is not necessarily 0 in the indecomposable modules. This
happens for the only irreducible representation of C(0), the trivial representation,
but it may happen for nontrivial indecomposable modules as well. Note that for all
parameters values k, the trivial representation of C(0) is contained in K • at least
once, in the form of the submodule K(0).

2.3. Singular parameter values. Let H i (k) denote the i-th cohomology group
of the complex (K • , d(k)). The following are equivalent:
Corollary 2.14. (i) H i (k) = 0, for all i > 0.
 (ii) H 0 (k) = C.
(iii) There exists a completely homogeneous intertwining map V(k) satisfying the
      conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of Theorem 2.9.
Proof. (i)⇒(ii): The complex (K • , d(k)) is a direct sum of the finite dimensional
subcomplexes K • (n) = ⊕l+m=n Km  l
                                     . Let us denote by H i (n, k) the cohomology
            •
groups of (K (n), d(k)). The Euler characteristic
                      X                          X
(15)          χ(n) :=    (−1)i dim(H i (n, k)) =     (−1)i dim(Kn−i
                                                                 i
                                                                     )
                       i≥0                        i≥0

is independent of k. Hence for all k, χ(n) = 0 if n > 0. Thus for all n > 0 and k
we have: if H i (n, k) = 0 for all i > 0, then H 0 (n, k) = 0.
    (ii)⇒(iii): We carry out the proof of the existence of an intertwining map W(k)
as in Theorem 2.9, but with the role of d(0) and d(k) interchanged. We can do
this, because we now know that d(k)2 = 0. Since we assume that H 0 (k) = C, we
see that the proof of Theorem 2.9 showing that the intertwiner has to be a linear
isomorphism also applies in this situation. Hence V(k) = W(k)−1 is an intertwining
operator as required.
    (iii)⇒(i): The argument in the proof of Theorem 2.9 showing that V(k) has to be
a linear isomorphism applies for all k. Hence V(k) defines an isomorphism between
the cohomology spaces H i (0) and H i (k).

Definition 2.15. The parameter k is called regular if the equivalent statements of
2.14 hold. Otherwise we say that k is singular.
We saw in Corollary 2.10 that if k is singular, then there exists a τ ∈ Ĝ such that
−cτ (k) = m ∈ N. More precisely we have:
Corollary 2.16. For τ ∈ Ĝ, let Pτ denote the τ -isotypical component of P , and
Pm,τ the τ -isotypical component of Pm . If k is singular, there exists a τ ∈ Ĝ and
m ∈ N such that cτ (k) + m = 0 and Pm,τ 6= 0.
Proof. If k is singular then there exists a submodule K(m, τ ) of K • such that
H 0 (K(m, τ ), d(k)) 6= 0 and m ∈ N. This implies that (Pm : τ ) > 0 and cτ (k) + m =
0.
The converse statement is false. A counterexample occurs already in the case of the
symmetric group S4 . Let τ be the irreducible 3 dimensional representation (2, 1, 1).
Then P5,τ 6= 0 and cτ (k) = 8k, but k = −5/8 is not a singular parameter.
  In the case of a finite Coxeter group, the set of singular k can be determined
exactly, cf. [8]. In the present generality we do not know how to prove a similar
explicit description.
2.4. An hermitian form. For ξ ∈ V , denote by ξ ∗ ∈ V ∗ the element such that for
all η ∈ V , ξ ∗ (η) = (ξ, η). The map ξ → ξ ∗ is an anti-linear isometric isomorphism.
We extend this to an anti-linear isomorphism ∗ : S → P , where S denotes the
symmetric algebra on V . The inverse map is denoted by ∗ as well. By the commu-
tativity of the operators Tξ (k), we can uniquely extend the linear map ξ → Tξ (k)

to obtain a linear map from S to End(V ). This map will be denoted by s → s(T )
(or by s → s(T (k)) if necessary). We define a sesquilinear pairing (·, ·)k on P by
(16)                             (p, q)k := (p∗ (T (k))q)(0).

Proposition 2.17. (i) For all g ∈ G, (pg , q g )k = (p, q)k .
 (ii) (ξ ∗ p, q)k = (p, Tξ (k)q)k .
(iii) (Pm,τ , Pl,σ )k = 0 if m 6= l or if τ 6= σ.
Proof. (i) This follows from the remark that for all p ∈ P , g ∈ G, (pg )∗ = g(p∗ ),
since for we have, for all x ∈ V ∗ and v ∈ V :
(17)            (gx∗ , v) = (x∗ , g −1 v) = x(g −1 v) = xg (v) = ((xg )∗ , v).
Hence by the equivariance of Tξ (k) we have:
        (pg , q g )k = ((g(p∗ )(T (k)))q g )(0)
                   = ((g ◦ p∗ (T (k)) ◦ g −1 )q g )(0) = (p∗ (T (k))q)g (0) = (p, q)k .
   (ii) This follows immediately from the definition, using the commutativity of the
Tξ (k).
   (iii) From the definition we see that (Pm , Pl )k = 0 if l 6= m. By (i) it follows
that (ep, q)k = (ep, eq)k = (p, eq)k for every self-adjoint idempotent e of C[G]. This
implies (iii).

The main theorem of this section is:
Theorem 2.18. The pairing satisfies (p, q)k = (q, p)k .
Proof. We prove this by induction on the degree m. By Proposition 2.17 it is
enough to show that for every τ ∈ Ĝ and m ∈ Z+ , (p, q)k = (q, p)k if p, q ∈ Pm,τ .
Assume by induction that this statement holds true for all p, q ∈ Pl,σ with l < m
(the case m = 0 being trivial). Let ei denote an orthonormal basis of V , and let
xi = e∗i denote the dual basis of coordinates on V . Then, since cτ (k) = cτ (k) by
Lemma 2.5, we have for all p, q ∈ Pm,τ :
                       (m + cτ (k))(p, q)k = (E(k)p, q)k
                                              X
                                           =(    xi Ti (k)p, q)k
                                                      i
                                                  X
                                              =           (Ti (k)p, Ti (k)q)k
                                                  i
                                                  X
                                              =           (Ti (k)q, Ti (k)p)k
                                                  i
                                                  X
                                              =           (xi Ti (k)q, p)k
                                                  i

                                              = (m + cτ (k))(q, p)k .
Since (p, q)k depends polynomially on k and since (l + cτ (k)) 6= 0 for generic values
of k, this proves the necessary induction step.

Corollary 2.19. For all x ∈ V ∗ and p, q ∈ P we have (Tx∗ (k)p, q)k = (p, xq)k .
              DUNKL OPERATORS FOR COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS                          11


Proof. We have

                            (Tx∗ (k)p, q)k = (q, Tx∗ (k)p)k
                                          = (xq, p)k
                                          = (p, xq)k .


As was noticed in Proposition 2.17, the finite dimensional subspaces Pm,τ ⊂ P
satisfy (Pm,τ , Pl,σ )k = 0 unless m = l and τ = σ. It follows that there exists a
polynomial p 6= 0 such that (p, P )k = 0 if and only if there exists a polynomial
q 6= 0 such that (P, q)k = 0. In this case we call the sesquilinear pairing (·, ·)k
degenerate.
Proposition 2.20. The following are equivalent:
  (i) k is singular.
 (ii) (·, ·)k is degenerate.
(iii) There exists a proper graded ideal I ⊂ P which is stable for the action of the
      operators Tξ (k).
(iv) k is singular.
Proof. (i)⇒(ii) Choose m > 0 such that there exists a 0 6= p ∈ Pm with d(k)p = 0.
Then (P, p)k = 0.
    (ii)⇒(iii) Take I := {p | (P, p)k = 0}.
    (iii)⇒(i) Let m > 0 be minimal such that Im 6= 0. Then d(k)Im = 0.
    (i)⇔(iv) By the above text, there exists a q 6= 0 such that (P, q)k = 0 if and only
if there exists a p ∈ P , p 6= 0 such that (p, P )k = 0. But by Theorem 2.18 this is
also equivalent to (P, p)k = 0. Hence, using the equivalence of (i) and (ii), we see
that (i) is indeed equivalent to (iv).

Corollary 2.21. The set K sing of singular parameter values consists of an infinite
union of hyperplanes Km,τ . Here Km,τ denotes the hyperplane given by the equation
m + cτ (k) = 0, and the union runs only over pairs (m, τ ) with τ nontrivial and
Pm,τ 6= 0.
Proof. By Proposition 2.16 we know that K sing is contained in the above union of
hyperplanes Km,τ . Notice that this is a locally finite set of hyperplanes. On the
other hand, by the above Proposition, K sing = ∪m∈N Km    degen
                                                                where Km degen
                                                                               denotes
                                                                               degen
the set of parameter values k such that (·, ·)k is degenerate on Pm . Now Km         is
given by the condition that the determinant of (·, ·)k with respect to a basis of Pm
                    degen
vanishes. Hence Km        is an algebraic hypersurface in the parameter space. Since
it has to be contained in ∪Km,τ , it follows that, as a subset of the parameter space,
   degen
Km       is a union of hyperplanes Km,τ . This proves the claim.

Corollary 2.22. Let Kr denote the Q-vector space of rational parameters k (i.e.
kC,i ∈ Q for all C, i). The set K sing ∩ Kr is a (locally finite) union of hyperplanes,
and K sing is the union of the complexifications of these rational hyperplanes.
Proof. The hyperplanes Km,τ are all rational, by Lemma 2.5.
12                            C.F. DUNKL AND E.M. OPDAM


Corollary 2.23. For every pair (m, τ ), there exists a basis (bi ) of Pm,τ such that
the determinant of (bi , bj )k is a product of linear factors of the form l + cσ (k) with
σ ∈ Ĝ nontrivial, and Pl,σ 6= 0.
Proof. The determinant is a polynomial in C[K] such that its zero set is contained
     degen
in Km      . Hence it contains only irreducible factors of the form l + cσ (k). The
determinant is determined up to multiplication by an arbitrary nonzero positive
real number by change of basis. When we specialize at k = 0, the pairing is clearly
positive definite hermitian, and thus we can fix the normalization by choosing an
appropriate basis.

The above results show that, in order to describe the set K sing , it suffices to describe
K sing ∩ Kr . By Proposition 2.20 this is equal to the set K degen ∩ Kr . In particular
we may restrict to real parameters, which has the advantage that, by Theorem 2.18,
the form (·, ·)k is hermitian:
Proposition 2.24. Suppose that k is real. Then
  (i) (·, ·)k is hermitian.
 (ii) Suppose moreover that, for all nontrivial irreducible representations τ ∈ Ĝ,
      cτ (k) + m(τ ) > 0, where m(τ ) denotes the lowest homogeneous degree such
      that (τ : Pm(τ ) ) 6= 0 (this holds in particular when all the parameters satisfy
      kC,j ≥ 0). Then (·, ·)k is positive definite.
Proof. (i) This is immediate from Theorem 2.18.
   (ii) This follows by induction on the homogeneous degree m, by taking p = q in
the computation in the proof of Theorem 2.18.

2.5. Lowest weight modules over the rational Cherednik algebra. We as-
sume that k is real throughout this subsection. Let us consider the structure of P
as a module over the rational Cherednik algebra A(k), the algebra generated by
C[G], Tξ (k) and P (acting on itself by multiplication) (see [10]).
Lemma 2.25. For p ∈ P , denote by m(p) the operator m(p) : P → P , m(p)(q) =
pq (multiplication by p). For convenience, we put kC,0 = 0, and for j ∈ Z we define
kC,j = kC,j ′ if j − j ′ is divisible by eC . In A(k) we have
(18)
                                  X eX
                                     H −1

     [Tξ (k), m(p)] = m(∂ξ p) +               eH (kH,i+j − kH,j )αH (ξ)α−1
                                                                        H m(ǫH,i (p))ǫH,j .
                                  H∈A i,j=0

In particular, we have
                                       X         X
(19)         [Tξ (k), m(x)] = x(ξ) +                    cg (k)αH (ξ)x(vH )αH (vH )−1 g,
                                       H∈A g∈GH ,g6=1

where vH ∈ V is the vector such that (vH , v) = αH (v) for all v ∈ V , and where
cg (k) is the constant
                                      eX
                                       H −1

(20)                       cg (k) =           χjH (g)(kH,j+1 − kH,j ).
                                       j=0

The function g → cg (k) is invariant for conjugation of g by G.

Proof. This follows in a straightforward way from the equations
                                          eX
                                           H −1

and
(22)               [ǫH,j , m(ǫH,i (p))] = m(ǫH,i (p))(ǫH,j−i − ǫH,j ).



Let us describe how A(k) fits into the framework of the paper [10]. Consider the
abstract associative algebra T (V + V ∗ ) ⊗ C[G], the smash product where G acts
diagonally on the tensor algebra T (V + V ∗ ). We introduce in this algebra the
relations [ξ, η] = 0 (for all ξ, η ∈ V ), [x, y] = 0 (for all x, y ∈ V ∗ ) and finally,
                               X       X
(23)          [ξ, x] = x(ξ) +                  cg (k)αH (ξ)x(vH )αH (vH )−1 g,
                             H∈A g∈GH ,g6=1

where cg (k) is as in equation 20. The resulting algebra A′ (k) is a symplectic re-
flection algebra in the sense of [10]. In particular, by Theorem 1.3 of [10], A′ (k)
has the PBW-property (this means that A′ (k) is isomorphic as a vector space to
P ⊗ S ⊗ C[G]). By construction, A(k) is a quotient of A′ (k) via P ∋ p → m(p),
S ∋ p∗ → p∗ (T (k)) and g → g (action in P ). Using the PBW-property one easily
identifies the A′ (k)-module P as
                                            A′ (k)
(24)                             P = IndS⊗C[G] (triv),

where triv is the one dimensional representation such that G acts trivially, and
triv(V ) = 0. In fact, it is not hard to see that P is a faithful module over A′ (k)
(see [10], Proposition 4.5). We will therefore identify A′ (k) and A(k) from now on.
   In the above construction we identified P with an induced module. We generalize
this construction in the following way. Let (V, τ ) be an irreducible module of G.
We extend τ to the algebra S ⊗ C[G] by demanding that τ (V ) = 0. We define
                                                     A′ (k)
(25)                           M (τ, k) := IndS⊗C[G] (τ ).

In the sequel we will usually suppress the parameter k ∈ K in the notation if no
confusion is possible. As a vector space, M (τ ) ≃ P ⊗ V . The action of G is the
diagonal action, P acts by multiplication in the left factor of the tensor product,
and the action of Tξ (k) is given by
(26)
                            X eX
                               H −1

  Tξ (p ⊗ v) = ∂ξ p ⊗ v +               eH (kH,i+j − kH,j )αH (ξ)α−1
                                                                  H ǫH,i (p) ⊗ ǫH,j (v),
                            H∈A i,j=0

according to equation 18. So we have in particular that P = M (triv).

Lemma 2.26. Let σ ∈ Ĝ and m ∈ Z+ . Let M (τ )σ of denote the σ-isotypic com-
ponent of M (τ ), andP let M (τ )m,σ = M (τ )σ ∩ (Pm ⊗ V ). The deformed Euler
vector field E(k) = i xi Ti (k) acts on M (τ )m,σ by multiplication with the scalar
m − cτ (k) + cσ (k).

Proof. From equation 26 we see that, for p ∈ Pm ,
                                 X eX
                                    H −1

       E(k)(p ⊗ v) = mp ⊗ v −              eH kH,j p ⊗ ǫH,j (v)

                                           eX
                                            H −1

                   = (m − cτ (k))p ⊗ v +           eH kH,l ǫ∆
                                                            H,l (p ⊗ v),
                                           l=0



where ǫ∆H,l denotes the idempotent ǫH,l acting diagonally on P ⊗ V . Thus on the
σ-isotypical part M (τ )m,σ of Pm ⊗ V , the action of E(k) is scalar with eigenvalue
m − cτ (k) + cσ (k), as claimed.

Proposition 2.27. All A(k)-submodules of M (τ ) are graded. In other words, if
M ⊂ M (τ ) is an A(k)-submodule, then
(27)                              M = ⊕m∈Z+ Mm
with Mm := M ∩ (Pm ⊗ V ). With respect to this grading, Tξ (k) has degree −1, x
has degree +1, and g ∈ G has degree 0.
Proof. Let M ⊂ M (τ ) be an A(k)-submodule. Since C[G] ⊂ A(k), we have M =
⊕σ∈Ĝ Mσ . By the preceding Lemma, the eigenvalues of the operator E(k) separate
elements of different homogeneous degree in each isotypic part Mσ . Therefore
Mσ = ⊕n Mσ ∩ (Pm ⊗ V ), and thus M itself is also the direct sum of its graded
pieces.

Corollary 2.28. The module M (τ ) has a unique proper maximal submodule. In
particular, M (τ ) is indecomposable.
Proof. Since τ is irreducible for the action of G, a submodule M ⊂ M (τ ) is proper
if and only if M ∩ V = {0} (where V = M (τ )0 as before). All submodules M ⊂ P
are graded, and therefore the sum M ′ of all proper submodules of M (τ ) also has the
property that M ′ ∩ V = {0}. Hence M ′ is the unique maximal proper submodule
of M (τ ).

Definition 2.29. We call a module M over A(k) a lowest weight module with
lowest G-type τ if M is a nontrivial quotient of M (τ, k). We denote by L(τ, k) (or
simply L(τ )) the unique irreducible quotient of M (τ, k).
The above Proposition 2.27 shows that all lowest weight modules M with lowest
G-type τ have a unique “natural” grading
(28)                              M = ⊕n∈Z+ Mn
such that M0 is the irreducible C[G]-module of type τ . Note that the submodules
of lowest weight modules are also graded (as they are subquotients of M (τ )). Note
however that the grading induced by M on a lowest weight submodule M ′ of M is
shifted with respect to the natural grading of M ′ (unless M = M ′ ).

   Notice the analogy with the theory of highest weight modules for a semisimple
Lie algebra over C. The role of Verma-modules is played by the modules M (τ ).
Let us call an element m ∈ M of a lowest weight module M of A(k) primitive if
Tξ (k)m = 0 for all ξ ∈ V . Clearly the subspace M p of primitive elements in M is
a graded G-subspace of M .
Proposition 2.30. Let M be an A(k)-module generated by a subspace M0 of prim-
itive vectors such that M0 is an irreducible C[G]-module of type τ . Then there exists
a surjective homomorphism φ : M (τ ) → M such that φ(M (τ )0 ) = M0 . The homo-
morphism φ is unique up to a scalar.
Proof. This is clear by the universal property of induced modules.

Proposition 2.31. (i) Let M be a lowest weight module with lowest G-type τ ,
      graded with its natural grading. Then the σ-isotypic component Mσp of M p
      is contained in Mm(τ,σ) with m(τ, σ) := cτ (k) − cσ (k). In particular, M p is
      finite dimensional.
                                       p                          p
 (ii) Let m ∈ Z+ be such that Mm          6= 0, and let H ⊂ Mm      be an irreducible G-
                     p
      subspace of Mm of type σ. The subspace J(H) := P H ⊂ M is a lowest weight
      submodule of M , of lowest G-type σ.
                                               p                      p
(iii) Let m ∈ Z+ be maximal such that Mm         6= 0, and let H ⊂ Mm    be an irreducible
                        p
      G-subspace of Mm of type σ. Then J(H) ≃ L(σ).
(iv) If, for all σ ∈ Ĝ, cτ (k) − cσ (k) 6∈ N, then M (τ ) is irreducible.
                      p                                              p
Proof. (i) Suppose Mm,σ    6= 0. By definition of primitivity, E(k)(Mm,σ ) = 0. On
the other hand, E(k) acts by multiplication with the scalar m − cτ (k) + cσ (k) on
M (τ )m,σ . Since Mm,σ is a quotient of this space, E(k) also acts on Mm,σ via
multiplication with this scalar. The equation m = m(τ, σ) for the degree m follows.
In particular, the dimension of M p is bounded by
                                      X
(29)                         d(M ) :=     dim(Mm(τ,σ) ).
                                       σ∈Ĝ

   (ii) J(H) is an A(k)-submodule of M , because Tξ (k)(ph) = [Tξ (k), m(p)](h) and,
by equation 18, we have [Tξ (k), m(p)] ∈ P ⊗ C[G]. By the above Proposition, J(H)
is a quotient of M (σ).
   (iii) By the condition on m we see that J(H)p = H, since clearly J(H)p ⊂ M p .
Thus every nonzero submodule of J(H) contains H, and is therefore equal to J(H).
Thus J(H) is the unique irreducible quotient of M (σ).
   (iv) This is a special case of (iii), since the condition implies that the maximal
value of m such that M (τ )pm 6= 0 is equal to 0. Thus we can take H = V = M (τ )0
in (ii) to see that M (τ ) = L(τ ) in this case.

Corollary 2.32. Each lowest weight module M has a finite Jordan-Hölder series
whose irreducible quotients are isomorphic to modules of the form L(σ).
Proof. By proposition 2.31 it is clear that M contains an irreducible submodule
J1 isomorphic to L(σ1 ) for some σ1 . If N1 := M/J1 = 0 we are done. If not,
we continue by choosing an irreducible submodule J2 ≃ L(σ2 ) in N1 , and form
the quotient N2 := N1 /J2 . We thus construct a sequence of consecutive quotients
M → N1 → N2 → . . . . Notice that by construction, d(Ni ) < d(Ni−1 ) (see equation
16                           C.F. DUNKL AND E.M. OPDAM


29) in each step of the process. Hence the process has to stop in finitely many
steps, say Nn = 0. Now put Mi := Ker(M → Nn−i ). Then we get
(30)                    M = M0 ⊃ M1 ⊃ M2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Mn = 0,
with Mi /Mi+1 = Ker(Nn−i−1 → Nn−i ) ≃ L(σn−i ), as desired.
We thus arrive at the following fundamental
Problem 2.33. For a lowest weight module M over A(k), denote by [M : L(σ, k)]
the multiplicity of L(σ) in a Jordan-Hölder series of M . Compute and interpret
the multiplicities [M (τ, k) : L(σ, k)].
   There are many natural questions and problems related to the topics introduced
in this subsection. One should study the structures that were introduced before in
the case of P = M (triv) (such as the contravariant pairing, the De Rham complex,
the singular set) systematically for general lowest weight modules. In addition, one
should consider the natural analogue of category O in the present situation. Except
for the remarks below, we resist the temptation to address any of these questions
here, since this would take us too far afield. The main goal of this paper is the
study of the special case τ = triv.
   Some straightforward remarks are in order. By Proposition 2.31 it is clear that
if M has lowest G-type τ , [M : L(σ, k)] is bounded by the multiplicity [Mm(τ,σ) : σ]
of σ in the degree m(τ, σ) = cτ (k) − cσ (k) part of M . In particular we see that
(31)                            [M (τ, k) : L(τ, k)] = 1
and that for σ 6= τ ,
(32)           [M (τ, k) : L(σ, k)] 6= 0 implies that cτ (k) − cσ (k) ∈ N.
Hence if we introduce an ordering of Ĝ by defining σ ≥ τ if and only if cσ (k) ≤ cτ (k),
then the matrix [M (τ ) : L(σ)] is unipotent upper triangular. In particular, the
matrix is invertible.
   Define the τ -singular set Kτsing ⊂ K as the set of k ∈ K such that M (τ, k) 6=
L(τ, k). The description of Kτsing is just one part of Problem 2.33. By the above
it is plain that k 6∈ Kτsing if for all σ, cτ (k) − cσ (k) 6∈ N. The converse is in
general not true (as we saw in the special case τ = triv). We see that Kτsing is
contained in a locally finite collection of hyperplanes, such that the coefficients of
the affine linear forms describing the hyperplanes are integral (but with signs). In
                                                                                 −b (C)
the case where τ is the linear character of G whose restriction to GH is χH τ
(for some bτ (C) ∈ {0, . . . , eH − 1}) if H ∈ C, then it follows by formula 26 that
M (τ, k) ≃ M (triv, βτ (k)) where βτ (k)C,j := kC,j+bτ (C) − kC,bτ (C) . In particular,
Kτsing = βτ−1 (K sing ).
2.6. The module P over A(k). Let us return to the module P = M (triv). In [8]
a polynomial q ∈ P+ was called singular for the parameter k if Tξ (k)q = 0 for all
ξ ∈ V . In other words, q is singular if and only if q ∈ H 0 (k) (see subsection 2.3)
and q(0) = 0. In the language of the previous subsection, a polynomial is singular
if and only if it is a primitive element of positive degree for the module P . In
addition, H 0 (k) = P p .
   Recall that, by definition, nonzero singular polynomials for k exist if and only if
k is a singular parameter. The space H 0 (k) of primitive polynomials for k is graded
                                                                           0
and is a G-space. For each τ ∈ Ĝ and degree m ∈ Z+ , we denote by Hm,τ        (k) the
               DUNKL OPERATORS FOR COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS                             17


space of primitive polynomials for k in degree m and of type τ . By Proposition
2.31, we have the relation
(33)                                   m = −cτ (k)
     0
if Hm,τ  6= 0, showing that H 0 (k) is finite dimensional. Suppose that H ⊂ Hm,τ 0
                                                                                    (k)
is an irreducible subspace. By Proposition 2.30, the ideal J(H) := P H it generates
in P is a lowest weight A(k)-submodule of P with lowest G-type τ .
   The form (·, ·)k on P is an hermitian contravariant form on the module P over
A(k), in the sense of Proposition 2.17 (i) and (ii). This construction can be extended
to all lowest weight modules, and it plays a role quite similar to the Shapovalov form
on Verma-modules for a semisimple Lie algebra. We will restrict ourselves to the
special case at hand, the module P . The radical Rad(k) := {p ∈ P | (p, P )k = 0}
of this form is a graded ideal of P , which is stable for G and for the application
of the operators Tξ (k) (see Proposition 2.20 and its proof). In other words, it is a
(graded) A(k)-submodule of P .
Proposition 2.34. The radical Rad(k) of (·, ·)k is the unique maximal proper
A(k)-submodule of P . In particular, P is not irreducible as an A(k)-module if
and only if k is singular, and P/ Rad(k) is the unique simple quotient L(triv, k) of
P.
Proof. Let M ⊂ P be a proper A(k)-submodule. Because 1 6∈ M we have, since
M is graded, (1, M )k = 0. But this clearly implies (P, M )k = 0, in other words:
M ⊂ Rad(k). Thus Rad(k) is the unique maximal proper A(k)-submodule of P .
    We are in the position to apply the technique of the Jantzen filtration (see [12],
Chapter 5), so let us discuss this briefly. Given a real parameter k0 ∈ K, consider
the real line L in K through k0 and 0. Note that k = 0 is a regular parameter,
hence a generic point on L will be a regular parameter as well. We parameterize
this line by k(t) := (1 + t)k0 and consider t as a real indeterminate. Let us denote
R = R[t]. For any complex vector space B we denote by BR := R ⊗R B the free
Rc = C ⊗R R = C[t]-module that arises from B by extension of scalars. Then AR is
a free associative Rc -algebra. For r ∈ Rc we define r∗ (t) := r(t) (recall that t = t).
Thus ∗ is a C-anti-linear involution on Rc . We have that PR is a module for AR . The
anti-linear isomorphism ∗ : P → S extends naturally to an anti-linear isomorphism
∗ : PR → SR , where anti-linear means that (rp)∗ = r∗ p∗ . We define a contravariant
hermitian form (·, ·)R with values in Rc on PR by (p, q)R := (p∗ (T (k(t))q)(0).
The form is linear in the second factor and anti-linear in the first factor. It is
hermitian in the sense that (p, q)R = (q, p)∗R , and contravariant in the sense that
(xp, q)R = (p, Tx∗ (k(t))q)R , (Tx∗ (k(t))p, q)R = (p, xq)R and (pg , q g )R = (p, q)R . Let
m0 denote the ∗-invariant maximal ideal m0 = tRc of Rc . We introduce a sequence
of Rc -linear subspaces MRi ⊂ PR defined by:
(34)                      MRi := {p ∈ PR | (PR , p)R ⊂ mi0 },

Lemma 2.35. The MRi form a decreasing sequence of AR -submodules in PR .
Proof. The sequence MRi is clearly a decreasing sequence of Rc -linear subspaces.
The fact that they are submodules follows from the contravariance of (·, ·)R .
Let us denote by ψ the specialization functor ψ(L) := L/tL (where L is an Rc -
module) at t = 0. We thus obtain a C-algebra homomorphism ψ : AR → A(k0 ).

This is compatible with the module structures of PR and P , in the sense that for
a ∈ AR and p ∈ PR , we have ψ(ap) = ψ(a)ψ(p). Also, ψ((p, q)R ) = (ψ(p), ψ(q))k0 .
We put
(35)                                  M i := ψ(MRi ).
For a graded subspace M of P we introduce the notation
                                    X
(36)                    Ch(M ) :=      dim(Mn )X n .
                                         n∈Z+


Proposition 2.36. (i) PR = M 0 ⊃ M 1 ⊃ M 2 . . . is a sequence of A(k0 )-
      submodules.P                  P
                               i                       n
 (ii) We have       i>0 Ch(M ) =       n≥0 ν(D(n))X , where D(n) denotes the de-
      terminant of (·, ·)R on PR,n (the Rc -module of polynomials of homogeneous
      degree n on V , with coefficients in Rc ), and where ν denotes the m0 -adic
      valuation on the polynomial ring Rc .
(iii) For i ≫ 0, M i = 0.
(iv) For p ∈ M i , let us denote by p̃ ∈ MRi an arbitrary element such that ψ(p̃) = p.
      For all p, q ∈ M i , the expression (p, q)(i) := ψ(t−i (p̃, q̃)R ) depends only on p
      and q, not on the chosen lifts p̃, q̃. The form (·, ·)(i) is hermitian and A(k0 )-
      contravariant on M i , and its radical is M i+1 . In particular, M 1 = Rad(k0 ).
Proof. (i) This follows directly from the above Lemma, by application of ψ to the
sequence MRi .
   (ii) Since the spaces PR,n are mutually orthogonal with respect to (·, ·)R , we see
         i
that MR,n    = {p ∈ PR,n | (PR,n , p)R ∈ mi0 }. We apply (an appropriately adapted
version of) Lemma 5.1 of [12] to the Rc -module PR,n , and obtain that for all n
                               X
(37)                               dim Mni = ν(D(n)),
                                i>0

where  Mni    :=  i
               ψ(MR,n )   = ψ(MRi )n . Note that D(n) is determined up to a unit in
Rc , so that ν(D(n)) is well defined. The result follows.
                                                                                   i
   (iii) By (ii) we see that given n ∈ N, there exists a b > 0 such that Mm          = 0
                                                                                 i
for all m < n and i > b. Take n > − maxτ ∈Ĝ cτ (k0 ) and suppose that M 6= 0 for
some i > b. Let l ∈ N be minimal such that Mli 6= 0, and let σ ∈ Ĝ be such that
   i                       i                                        i
Ml,σ   6= 0. Then Tξ (k0 )Ml,σ = 0 for each ξ, and thus E(k0 )Ml,σ     = 0. On the other
                                        i
hand, the eigenvalue of E(k0 ) on Ml,σ equals l + cτ (k0 ) > 0, since l ≥ n > −cτ (k0 ).
This is a contradiction.
   (iv) This follows by [12], Bemerkung after Lemma 5.1. Notice that the expression
(p, q)(i) is independent of the lifts p̃ and q̃ since, if a ∈ MRi ∩ tP , we have
(38)                       (a, MRi )R ⊂ t(P, MRi )R ⊂ mi+1
                                                       0 .

When i = 0, we have (·, ·)(0) = (·, ·)k0 . Thus the result M 1 = Rad(k0 ) is the special
case i = 0.
We end the section with a hint for the interpretation of the multiplicities δτ (k) =
[P = M (triv, k), L(τ, k)]. Suppose that G has a Coxeter-like presentation (in the
sense of [1], Appendix 2) such that its diagram also provides a presentation of the
fundamental group (the braid group) of the regular orbit space of G. Suppose that
the cyclotomic Hecke algebra H(G, u) corresponding to the diagram of G can be

generated by |G| elements over the ring Z[u, u−1 ]. The inhomogeneous relations for
the simple generators of H(G, q) are of the form
(39)                  (Ts − uC,0 )(Ts − uC,1 ) . . . (Ts − uC,eC −1 ) = 0
where s is a reflection in a certain cyclic group GH with H ∈ C ∈ C, with determi-
nant det(s) = exp(2πi/eC ). Let us now view the parameter value uC,j as a function
of the parameters kC,j as follows
(40)                     uC,j → qC,j := exp(2πi(j − eC kC,j )/eC ).
We extend the ring of definition of H(G, q) to the ring R of entire functions in the
parameters kC,j via this substitution. The resulting algebra is denoted by H(G)R .
It is known that the Hecke algebra H(G)K over the quotient field K of R is split
semi-simple (see [17], Corollary 6.6), so that we can uniquely parameterize the
irreducible representations πτ of H(G)K by the irreducible representations τ of G.
Let U denote the principal indecomposable block of the trivial representation in
the m-adic completion H(G)m of H(G)R , and let Km denote the quotient field of
the ring Rm of formal power series in k centered at v. The results and method of
[8] seem to suggest that the multiplicities δτ′ (v) defined by
(41)                       Km ⊗ U = ⊕τ ∈Ĝ δτ′ (v)(Km ⊗ (πτ )m )
are related to the multiplicities δτ (v) if vC,j < 0 for all C, j.
   In the next section we will turn to the study of the infinite family of imprimitive
groups. The set K sing will be described in detail for this class of complex reflection
groups.

                          3. The groups of type G (m, p, N )
3.1. Introduction. In this section we study the particular case of the complex
reflection group called G (m, p, N ), which is a finite subgroup of U (N ). Because
of its close relation to the symmetric group it is possible to perform a detailed
analysis of the Dunkl operators (constructed for real reflection groups in [3]), the
pairing, and the analogues of the nonsymmetric Jack polynomials. In fact, the
special case G (2, 1, N ) is exactly the hyperoctahedral group (type B), and the
results of one of the authors (Dunkl [6],[7]) on type-B polynomials motivate the
methods used in this section. Some of the notation used in the first section is
changed here to a mode better suited to deal with monomials and permutations.
The fundamental objects are polynomials in x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) ∈ CN (considered
as coordinate functions); the group is realized as a subgroup of the matrix group
U (N ) acting on the row vector x. For a multi-index (composition) α ∈ NN                     0 let
       PN                                               QN
|α| = i=1 αi and let xα denote the monomial i=1 xα                  i
                                                                      i
                                                                        .  To a permutation w ∈ SN
(the symmetric group on N letters) associate an N × N permutation matrix with
1’s at the (w (j) , j) entries. The action on x is given by (xw)i = xw(i) ; the action
on polynomials is wp (x) = p (xw). Thus the action on monomials is w (xα ) = xwα
where (wα)i = αw−1 (i) (consider α as a column vector). The symmetric group
contains the transpositions (i, j), for i 6= j, defined by
                                                  i           j
                                                                          
                          x (i, j) = x1 , . . . , xj , . . . , xi , . . . .

   For a fixed m = 2, 3, . . . let η = e2πi/m , an mth root of unity, then the complex
reflection group W of type G (m, 1, N ) consists of the N × N permutation matrices
20                           C.F. DUNKL AND E.M. OPDAM


with the nonzero entries being powers of η. The group is generated by the trans-
positions (i, i + 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1, and by the complex reflection τN where τi is
defined by
                                                 i

                              xτi = x1 , . . . , ηxi , . . . ,

for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . The powers τis are also reflections. Thus τis xα = η sαi xα for
α ∈ NN0 . The symmetric group SN is obviously a subgroup of W . The group
W acts on polynomials by wp (x) = p (xw) for w ∈ W . There are some obvious
commutation relationships: (where xi denotes the multiplication operator)
                                     xi τi = η −1 τi xi ,
                                  (i, j) τi = τj (i, j) ,
and the elements τi−s (i, j) τis are ordinary (period 2) reflections in W . In terms of
root vectors v 6= 0, such a reflection is given by xσv = x − 2 hv, xi /||v||2 v (where
                                           PN                                      1/2

desirable to use coordinates. The action can be expressed in another useful way.

s ≡ 0 mod p is equivalent to the periodicity condition on the values of κj stated
above.

monomial in a polynomial has the same parity type then we say the polynomial has
that type. Proposition 3.3 implies that if a polynomial p (x) has the same type as
                                                         α −1
xα for some α ∈ NN0 then Ti p (x) has the same type as x xi    (or xα xm−1
                                                                       i   if αi = 0).
                            N
Thus the operators {Ti xi }i=1 preserve parity type. We will define an inner-product
structure on polynomials in which these are self-adjoint. Just as in the symmetric
group case they do not commute but can be modified to form a commutative set.
First we need to calculate the commutant [xj , Ti ] = xj Ti − Ti xj .

Proposition 3.5. For i 6= j, [xj , Ti ] = κ0 m−1    s −s         s
                                              s=0 η τj (i, j) τj .

Proof. Use the definition of Ti and consider xj Ti − Ti xj . The terms involving
differentiation and transpositions (i, t) with t 6= i, j cancel, leaving only

This completes the proof.

                 DUNKL OPERATORS FOR COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS                           23

                                   P
   The group algebra elements r<i λri (for 1 < i ≤ N ) are the analogues of the
Jucys-Murphy elements for the symmetric group. The inner product we will use
is the pairing (p, q)k = p∗ (T ) q (x) |x=0 , which means that the operator p∗ (T ) ,
obtained from p∗ (x) = p (x) (each coefficient of p is conjugated) by replacing each
xi by Ti , is applied to the polynomial q (x) and the resulting polynomial is evaluated
at x = 0. Obviously if p, q are homogeneous of the same degree then p∗ (T ) q (x) is a
constant (degree 0); and if p, q are homogeneous of different degrees then (p, q)k = 0.
Of course this is the coordinatized form of the general definition given in 16. The
known results for SN are used to analyze the action of Ti by factoring polynomials
into a “parity part” and a part invariant under the complex reflections τi . Introduce
a new variable
                             y = (y1 , . . . , yN ) = (xm            m
                                                        1 , . . . , xN ) .
Say that a composition α ∈ NN  0 is a parity type if 0 ≤ αi < m for each i. If all the
terms of a polynomial p (x) have the same parity type then p can be expressed in
the form p (x) = xα g (y) for some parity type α. The type-A Dunkl operators (see
Section 8.3 in the monograph [9] by Dunkl and Xu) are defined by
                               ∂             X g (y) − (i, j) g (y)
                   Di g (y) =     g (y) + κ0                        ,

                                                     j6=i

for 1 ≤ i ≤ N (using the same notation (i, j) for the transpositions acting on y as
on x). Often we write 1−(i,j)
                       yi −yj g (y) for the inner term.

Proposition 3.9. Suppose g (y) is a polynomial and α is a parity type then

                                       i   Di g (y) .

Consequently, for each j 6= i we obtain the equality xα xm−1             i               g (y) =
                                                                             yi − yj

(i, j) for αi > αj are cancelled out.
                                                                  P
    If αi = 0 then Ti xα g (y) = mxα xm−1i

before. The case αi > αj can not occur so that Ej = xm−1

                                                                                yi − yj
completes the proof.

3.2. Simultaneous Eigenfunctions. We use the nonsymmetric Jack polynomials
from the type-A machinery to produce a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunction
for the commuting operators {Ui : 1 ≤ i ≤ N }. The nicest case is for polynomials
of “standard parity type”, that is, of the form xα g (y) such that i < j implies
αi ≥ αj . This means that in the list (α1 , α2 , . . . , αN ) the values αi = m − 1 appear
first, then the values αi = m − 2 and so on until the end of the list composed
of αi = 0 values (roughly (m − 1, . . . , m − 1, m − 2, . . . , m − 2, . . . , 0)). Not every
value need appear, of course. First we restate Proposition 3.9 for the commuting
operators.

Proposition 3.10. Suppose g (y) is a polynomial and α is a parity type then
     1. if 0 ≤ αi < m − 1 then Ui xα g (y) =                                       !        !
                  αi + 1                                   P               P
        = mxα            + καi +1 + Di yi − 1 − κ0                +                    (i, j) g (y) ;
                    m                                    αj >αi       j<i,αj =αi
                                                                                           !
                                                                           P
     2. if αi = m − 1 then Ui xα g (y) = mxα        Di yi − κ0                     (i, j) g (y) .
                                                                  j<i,αj =m−1

                                    Pm−1 −s                    Pm−1
Proof. For any β ∈ NN 0 we have       s=0 τi    (i, j) τis xβ = s=0 η s(βi −βj ) (i, j) xβ
= m (i, j) xβ if βj P
                    ≡ βi mod m and else equals 0. Thus the second part of Ui
contributes −κ0          (i, j) g (y) (and (i, j) xα = xα for such j). When αi =
                   j<i,αj =αi
m − 1 then write xi xα as xα x1−m
                              i   yi and use part (2) of Proposition 3.9.

     Following Definition 8.3.4 in [9], the type-A (commuting) operators are defined
by
                                                        X
                                UiA = Di yi + κ0 − κ0         (i, j) .
                                                        j<i

The nonsymmetric Jack polynomials are defined by means of a partial order on
compositions.

Definition 3.11. For µ, ν ∈ NN0 the relation µ ≻ ν means      i=1 µi ≥   i=1 νi for
each j and µ 6= ν (dominance order); µ+ is defined to be the (unique) partition wµ

means |µ| = |v| and µ+ ≻ ν + or µ+ = ν + and µ ≻ ν.

so that β = α + mγ (as vectors; that is, βi = αi + mγi and γi = ⌊βi /m⌋ for each i).
We will construct a simultaneous eigenfunction for each β. When α is a standard
parity type the nonsymmetric Jack polynomials work directly.
Proposition 3.12. Suppose α is a standard parity type, g is any polynomial in y,
and 1 ≤ i ≤ N , then
                                                                            

Proof. By definition of standard parity type, for any i the set {j : αj > αi } ∪
{j : j < i & αj = αi } is exactly the set {j : 1 ≤ j < i} .

Corollary 3.13. Suppose α is a standard parity type, and γ ∈ NN    0 then

    Suppose α′ is any parity type, but not standard. The idea is to use a permutation
which maps α′ to a standard parity type in such a way that the original order of
coordinates with the same value of α′i is preserved. For technical reasons it is easier
to do this backwards. Suppose that α is a standard parity type and suppose w ∈ SN
(a permutation) and has the property that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N and αi = αj implies
w (i) < w (j). We will show that wxα ζβ (y) is an eigenvector of each Ui . We use
the transformation properties(holding for any w ∈ SN ) : wDi yi = Dw(i) yw(i) w and
(r, s) w = w w−1 (r) , w−1 (s) for r 6= s (the action of permutations is as follows: w
is an N × N permutation matrix with 1’s at the (w (i) , i) entries, x is a row vector,
compositions are column vectors; so that w (xα ) = xwα where (wα)w(i) = αi for
any i). In the following wxα ζγ (y) is the polynomial xwα ζγ (yw) (with parity type
wα).

standard parity type so αj ≥ αi ; furthermore if αj = αi for some j then j < i if
and only if w (j) < w (i) . The proof of part (1) is now completed similarly to the
proof of Proposition 3.12.
   The proof of part (2) is an obvious modification of that for part (1).
3.3. Evaluation of the Pairing. We recall some facts from Proposition 2.17 and
Theorem 2.18.
Theorem 3.15. The pairing (·, ·)k has the following properties (with p, q ∈ Pn ):
     1. (q, p)k = (p, q)k ;
     2. (Ti xi p, q)k = (p, Ti xi q)k for 1 ≤ i ≤ N ;
     3. (wp, wq)k = (p, q)k for any w ∈ W.
Proof. From the definition it is clear that (p, Ti xi q)k = (xi p, xi q)k , and by part (1)
we have (Ti xi p, q)k = (q, Ti xi p)k = (xi q, xi p)k = (xi p, xi q)k .

5.2.7 and Section 9.6.3 in [9]). It is an interesting question whether there is a
similar situation for the complex group.
   By the properties of the pairing in Theorem 3.15 there are obvious orthogonality
relations.
Lemma 3.16. The operators Ui are self-adjoint for (·, ·)k .
Proof. The reflections σ = τi−s (i, j) τis are self-adjoint (by part (2) of Theorem 3.15
because σ 2 = 1. By part (3) of this theorem Ti xi is self-adjoint, thus, Ui is also.

Proposition 3.17. Suppose α, β are parity types and µ, ν ∈ NN             0 then:

  For part (2), suppose that µi 6= νi for some i. By Lemma 3.16, we have the
equality (Ui xα ζµ (y) , xα ζν (y))k = (xα ζµ (y) , Ui xα ζν (y))k . This proves the claim,
because the two polynomials are eigenfunctions with different eigenvalues.

   For other parity types see Proposition 3.14. To do the nontrivial pairings we
collect some facts and notation from the SN case. An element λ ∈ NN    0 is a partition
if λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λN . For any γ ∈ NN 0 let γ
                                                 +
                                                    be the unique partition such that
γ + = wγ for some w ∈ SN . For γ ∈ NN   0 and ε = ± let
                          Y                                        

For a partition λ and indeterminate t (and implicit parameter κ0 ) the generalized

For 0 ≤ l ≤ m − 1 and 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 define the indicator functions χi (l) = il and
extend coordinate-wise to parity types, that is, χi (α) ∈ NN
                                                           0 and (χi (α))j = χi (αj )
for each j. The rest of the section is mostly concerned with proving the following.
Theorem 3.18. Let α be a standard parity type and let γ ∈ NN0 , then

                                              h (γ + , 1)
   The argument has three main steps:
   1. find (xα ζγ (y) , xα ζγ (y))k in terms of (ζγ (y) , ζγ (y))k ;
   2. find (ζγ (y) , ζγ (y))k in terms of (ζλ (y) , ζλ (y))k , where λ = γ + ;
   3. find (ζλ (y) , ζλ (y))k in terms of (ζλ−εM (y) , ζλ−εM (y))k where λM > 0 and
      λM+1 = 0 or M = N.
   The formula is valid for the trivial case α = 0 = γ. The method of proof is
to assume the formula for lower degrees and show the above mentioned ratios are
consistent with the formula.

Proof. We reduce the degree of xα by one at each step so that each intermediate
stage is a standard parity type. Suppose that αs = l > αs+1 for some s, or s = N

and i < j and γi = γj implies w (i) < w (j). We claim that w (γ + χt (α)) =
              +
(γ + χt (α)) for 1 ≤ t ≤ m − 1. We must show that γi + χt (αi ) > γj + χt (αj )
implies w (i) < w (j); the condition is equivalent to γi − γj > χt (αj ) − χt (αi ). If
χt (αj ) ≥ χt (αi ) then γi > γj and w (i) < w (j). By definition of standard type
                                N
the finite sequence (χt (αi ))i=1 is nonincreasing (a partition), thus χt (αj ) < χt (αi )
implies χt (αi ) = 1, χt (αj ) = 0 and i < j. So γi + 1 > γj ; if γi > γj or if γi = γj
and i < j then w (i) < w (j).

m (A + γs ) xβ ζγ (y), where A = ml + κl + (N − w (s)) κ0 . This is the desired fac-

multiple of ζγ (y).
    We state the definition of an admissible inner product h·, ·i on polynomials associ-
ated with SN . For polynomials g1 (y) , g2 (y) we require that (1) hg1 (y) , g2 (y)i = 0 if
g1 , g2 are homogeneous of different degrees, (2) for any w ∈ SN , hwg1 (y) , wg2 (y)i =
hg1 (y) , g2 (y)i and (3) hDi yi g1 (y) , g2 (y)i = hg1 (y) , Di yi g2 (y)i for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . The
pairing h·, ·iT is permissible; the first two properties have been established         already,

and by Proposition 3.9 we have Ti xi g (y) = m m               + κ1 − 1 + Di yi g (y). This
proves property (3). The following is a consequence of Theorem 8.5.8 in [9].

3.4. The Radical. The radical for the hermitian form (·, ·)k is the linear space
Rad (κ) of polynomials p such that (q, p)k = 0 for any polynomial q; the space
depends on the parameter values κ0 , κ1 , . . . , κm−1 . For the group G (m, p, N ) the
set of singular values (when Rad (κ) 6= {0}) can be explicitly stated with refer-
ence to the discriminant. Briefly, the radical is nontrivial exactly when any of
the linear functions occurring in (f, f )k take on values in 0, −1, −2, −3 . . . where

f = (x1 x2 . . . xN )        1≤i<j≤N xi − xj . The proof of this requires extra care
when κ0 ∈ −N because some of the nonsymmetric Jack polynomials fail to exist
for such values. By careful analysis of their construction one sees that the poles
can occur only at values of the form nκ0 + l = 0 for 1 ≤ n ≤ N and l ∈ N. In the
following κ refers to the parameters (κi )m−1i=0
                                                                            	
Definition 3.21. Let K0 = κ : κ0 = − nj − l : l ∈ N0 , 2 ≤ j − 1 ≤ n ≤ N and let
                                                	
K1 = ∪m−1
        i=1 ∪n=0
                 N −1
                        κ : nκ0 + mi + κi ∈ −N0 .
   We claim the set of singular values is K0 ∪ K1 .
   Firstly, suppose κ ∈/ K0 and κ0 ∈  / −N; in this case all the functions ζα exist,
                                          N
the simultaneous eigenfunctions of {Ui }i=1 span the polynomials and the pairing
formulae are valid. If κ ∈ K1 then there is a (nonzero) polynomial xα ζλ (y) (some
standard parity type α, a partition λ) which is orthogonal to each polynomial, thus
in Rad (κ). On the other hand, suppose there is a nonzero p ∈ Rad (κ) then expand
p in terms of the eigenvector basis and let wxα ζγ (y) appear in the expansion with a
              DUNKL OPERATORS FOR COMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS                           31


nonzero coefficient (see Proposition 3.14); by the orthogonality relations this implies
(xα ζγ (y) , xα ζγ (y))k = 0 and thus κ ∈ K1 .
   Secondly, suppose κ ∈ K1 and κ0 = l ∈ −N; but K1 is closed so take a sufficiently
close κ′ ∈ K1 with κ′0 ∈   / −N (in the same component as κ), for this value there
is a nonzero polynomial p (a simultaneous eigenfunction) in Rad (κ); for some
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . (κ0 − l)n p has no poles and a nonzero limit at κ0 = l. For any
                                     n
polynomial q we have (q, (κ0 − l) p)k = 0 for all κ′ close to κ, thus Rad (κ) is
nontrivial.
   Thirdly, let κ ∈ K0 ; by the results in [8] there is a nonzero polynomial g (y) of
least degree in the type-A radical, which implies Di g (y) = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N . By
Proposition 3.9 Ti g (y) = 0 for all i and so g (y) ∈ Rad (κ) .
   It remains to show that if κ ∈    / K0 ∪ K1 and κ0 ∈ −N then Rad (κ) = {0}.
                                                                   N
The problem is that the simultaneous eigenfunctions of {Ui }i=1 no longer span the
polynomials; nevertheless it is still possible to give an argument based on triangu-
larity properties. We will show that κ ∈    / K1 and Rad (κ) 6= {0} implies κ ∈ K0 .
Suppose that p ∈ Rad (κ) and p 6= 0; because Rad (κ) is an ideal the polynomial
g (y) = xα p (x) ∈ Rad (κ) (if the parity type of p is β let αi = m − βi for each i).
Suppose that g0 (y) ∈ Rad (κ) and has minimal degree (among polynomials in y).
Consider the polynomials Ti g0 (y) = mxm−1   i   Di g0 (y); if each Di g0 = 0 then g0 is
in the type-A radical and κ ∈ K0 . Suppose not, we may assume         D1 g0 (y) 6= 0. By
                     m            m
                                    Qm−1 i
Proposition 3.9 T1 g0 (y) = m         i=1  m + κi + D1 y1 − 1 D1 g0 (y). We now use
the fact that D1 y1 is triangular (see p.454 in [7]) with respect to the partial order ⊲
(see Definition 3.11). Let cy γ be a nonzero term in D1 g0 with maximal (for ⊲) γ;this
                                                            Qm−1
implies that the coefficient of y γ in T1m g0 (y) is mm i=1 mi + κi + v c where
                                                                           i
ν = κ0 (N − 1 − # {j : γj > γ1 })+γ1 ; the hypothesis κ ∈    / K1 implies m  +κi +v 6= 0
                        m
for each i but then T1 g0 (y) is a nonzero polynomial in y in the radical and of lower
degree than g0 , a contradiction.
   Thus the detailed knowledge of type-A polynomials makes it possible to describe
the set of singular values for G (m, 1, N ) and indeed for any G (m, p, N ). For the
latter impose the periodicity conditions in Remark 3.4 on κ.
3.5. Shift Operators. Suppose G is a complex reflection group and recall the
definitions of Section 2. Let p be a G-invariant polynomial, and C a G-orbit of
reflection hyperplanes. Given a rational function f on V , we denote by m(f ) the
operator “multiplication by f ”. Observe that, for s ∈ N with s < eC , the operator
                                 !                           !
                          Y                           Y
                     m       α−s
                               H   ◦ p∗ (T (k)) ◦ m      αsH
                          H∈C                           H∈C

has the property that it maps P G to P G .
Question 3.22. Is the above operator on P G equal to the restriction to P G of an
operator of the form p∗ (T (k ′ )), where k ′ is obtained by incrementing some of the
values of k = (kC,i )?
   This is well known in the case of real reflection groups [11], and in that case the
relation plays an important role in many applications [14]. The proofPof this “shift
relation” is based in this case on the presence of the invariant p =       x2i of order
two. For this invariant the relation can be checked by simple direct computation.
Then one remarks that this forces the relation also to be true for the higher order
invariants, using sl2 representation theory (see [11]).

   We do not know of any general argument that works in the present case of
complex reflection groups. Nevertheless, in this section we shall show that the
answer to this question is affirmative for the groups G (m, p, N ). The argument is
again based on a reduction to the case of SN .
   First we deal with shifting the parameters κi , 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, forP         the group
G (m, 1, N ). We recall the type-A commutation Di yi − yi Di = 1 + κ0 j6=i (i, j),
                                                                          P
where y = (xm               m
               1 , . . . , xN ); thus yi Di = Yi with Yi = Di yi − 1 − κ0  j6=i (i, j) and
                                                               N
(Di yi ) Di = Di Yi , for each i. Let v = (1, 1, . . . , 1) ∈ N .

Proposition 3.23. Let 1 ≤ t ≤ m − 1 and let g be any polynomial in y then

                                                               m
                             Ti (κ)m xtv g (y) = xtv Ti (κ′ ) g (y) ,

for 1 ≤ i ≤ N , where κ′ = (κ0 , κ1 + 1, . . . , κt + 1, κt+1 , . . . , κm−1 ) .

                             m
             = xtv Ti (κ′ ) g (y) .

In each of the products the terms commute pairwise so the order does not matter.
The relation (Di yi ) Di = Di Yi is used to move Di to the front (last in the order
                                        m
of operation). The formula for Ti (κ′ ) g (y) is obtained by setting t = 0 in the
starting calculation.


   The argument must be modified for G (m, p, N ) for 1 < p < m. Recall from
Remark 3.4 that κsm/p = 0 and κt+sm/p = κt for 1 ≤ s ≤ p − 1 and 1 ≤ t ≤ m          p − 1.

We will use κ to denote κ0 , κ1 , . . . , κm/p−1 in this discussion. The invariants
for G (m, p, N ) are generated by the elementary symmetric functions of degrees
1, 2, . . . , N −1 in y and x(m/p)v . Here is the modification of the previous proposition.
                                                                         m

used. This completes the proof.

Remark 3.25. It may appear that the shift of p1 is significantly different from the
shift of 1 for the group G (m, 1, N ), but in fact, the parameters κi should be replaced
by pκi (for 1 ≤ i ≤ m   p − 1) to conform to the general setup of Section 2 and so the
shift is effectively 1.
We turn to the parameter κ0 associated with the action of the symmetric group.
Using the known results for SN , we are going to prove that f (T (κ)) aδ (y) g (y)

Q
     1≤i<j≤N (yi − yj ), κ′ = (κ0 + 1, κ1 , . . . , κm−1 ) and f, g are (real) symmetric poly-
nomials in y.
   Recall some facts from Section 3.3: for any partition λ ∈ NN         0 the space Xλ (κ0 ) =
span {wζλ : w ∈ SN } = span {ζwλ : w ∈ SN } (the R-span) is equipped with two
permissible inner products (·, ·)k and h·, ·iκ0 , where the inner product hf, giκ0 =
f (D (κ0 )) g (y) for f, g ∈ Xλ (κ0 ). We have shown that
                                   Y

First we establish the formula (aδ f, aδ g)k = (aδ , aδ )k (f, g)k′ where (f, g)k′ denotes
the pairing for κ′ and f, g are symmetric polynomials in y. The result of Heckman
[11] shows that haδ f, aδ giκ0 = haδ , aδ iκ0 hf, giκ0 +1 . Further, there is a unique
SN -invariant jλ (up to scalar multiple) in Xλ , and if λ1 > λ2 > . . . > λN then
there is a unique skew-invariant aλ ∈ Xλ (see Section 3.3). Further the invariant
polynomial aλ+δ (κ0 ) /aδ = jλ (κ0 + 1) (note the dependence on the parameter),
see Opdam [16]; we take the constant as 1 for convenience. If λ, µ are partitions
in NN0 then λ 6= µ implies Xλ (κ0 ) ⊥Xµ (κ0 ) in any permissible inner product,
hence (aλ+δ (κ0 ) , aµ+δ (κ0 ))k = 0. The polynomials aλ+δ (κ0 ) /aδ form a basis
for the symmetric polynomials so it suffices to prove the formula for the cases
f = g = aλ+δ (κ0 ) /aδ . Thus

Proposition 3.26. Suppose f, g are symmetric polynomials in y then
                      f (T (κ)) aδ (y) g (y) = aδ (y) f (T (κ′ )) g (y) ,
where κ′ = (κ0 + 1, κ1 , . . . , κm−1 ).
Proof. Without loss of generality assume that f, g are homogeneous. By the group-
invariance properties of the pairing f (T (κ)) aδ (y) g (y) is a skew- symmetric poly-
nomial and hence divisible by aδ (y) with a symmetric quotient. If deg f > deg g the
quotient is zero. If deg f = deg g then f (T (κ)) aδ (y) g (y) = caδ (y) for some con-
stant c; thus by the preceding formula we obtain aδ (T (κ)) f (T (κ)) aδ (y) g (y) =

(aδ (T (κ)) aδ (y)) (f (T (κ′ )) g (y)) (recall (aδ , aδ )k 6= 0 for generic κ, which suffices
to prove this Q [κ] polynomial identity).
   Suppose deg f = l < deg g = n and let f1 be an arbitrary homogeneous sym-
metric polynomial of degree n − l. Then we have f1 (T (κ)) f (T (κ)) aδ (y) g (y)
= aδ (y) f1 (T (κ′ )) f (T (κ′ )) g (y), but f (T (κ′ )) g (y) is symmetric of degree n − l.
Hence aδ (y) f1 (T (κ′ )) f (T (κ′ )) g (y) = f1 (T (κ)) aδ (y) f (T (κ′ )) g (y). This iden-
tity holds for all κ and implies the claimed formula when κ is not singular. The
formula is again a polynomial in κ, hence is valid for all κ.
Now we can state the analogue of Corollary 4.5 of [8]:
Corollary 3.27. For G = G(m, p, N ), let π := x(m/p−1)v aδ . Let 1 denote the
parameter tuple such that 1C,i = 1 for both the orbits of reflection hyperplanes C,
and i = 1, . . . , eC − 1 (in the notation k = (kC,i ) of Section 2, not the tuple (κi ) of
the present section; cf. Remark 3.25; if p = m or N = 1 we have only one orbit).
For all p, q ∈ P G we have
(43)                            (πp, πq)k = (π, π)k (p, q)k+1 .
Proof. As in [8] we have, using Theorem 2.18, Proposition 3.24 and Proposition
3.26
                             (πp, πq)k = (π, p∗ (T (k))πq)k
                                         = (π, πp∗ (T (k + 1))q)k
                                         = (π, π)k (p, q)k+1 ,
since we may assume that the degrees of p and q are equal.
This result in fact gives an alternative proof of the explicit description of the radical
which was derived in the previous subsection, analogous to the proof given in [8].
  These results may help in formulating more general statements for arbitrary
complex reflection groups.
