                                             0     Introduction
                                             In this paper we deal with the b-functions of the invariants on the flag manifolds G/P . In
                                             the case where P is a Borel subgroup, Kashiwara [4] determined the b-functions by using the
                                             universal Verma modules. Our method is a generalization of Kashiwara’s approach.
                                                 Let g be a simple Lie algebra over the complex number field C, and let G be a connected
                                             simply-connected simple algebraic group with Lie algebra g. Fix a parabolic subalgebra p of
                                             g. We denote the reductive part of p and the nilpotent part of p by l and n respectively. Let L
                                             be the subgroup of G corresponding to l. Let R be the symmetric algebra of the commutative
                                             Lie algebra p/[p, p]. For a Lie algebra a we set UR (a) = R ⊗C U (a) where U (a) denotes the
                                             enveloping algebra of a. The canonical map p → R induces a one-dimensional UR (p)-module
                                             Rc . Let Cµ be the one-dimensional p-module with weight µ. Set Rc+µ = Rc ⊗C Cµ . Then
                                             Rc+µ is a one-dimensional UR (p)-module.
                                                 For a character µ of p we regard µ as a weight of g, and let V (µ) be the irreducible
                                             g-module with highest weight µ. We assume that the weight µ of g is dominant integral. We
                                             define a UR (g)-module homomorphism
                                                                   ι : UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ → UR (g) ⊗UR (p) (Rc ⊗C V (µ))
                                             by ι(1 ⊗ 1) = 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ vµ , where vµ is the highest weight vector of V (µ). For a UR (g)-module
                                             homomorphism ψ from UR (g) ⊗UR (p) (Rc ⊗C V (µ)) to UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ the composite ψι

                                                                                               1
is the multiplication on UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ by an element ξ of R:

                         UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ                    UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ

(0.1)                                                                   y
                    UR (g) ⊗UR (p) (Rc ⊗C V (µ)) −−−→ UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ .
                                                         ψ

The set Ξµ consisting of all ξ ∈ R induced by homomorphisms from UR (g)⊗UR (p) (Rc ⊗C V (µ))
to UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ as above is an ideal of R. We can construct
                                                                     a particular element ψµ ∈
HomUR (g) UR (g) ⊗UR (p) (Rc ⊗C V (µ)), UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ by considering the irreducible de-
composition of V (µ) as a p-module (see Section 2 below), however, the corresponding ξµ ∈ Ξµ
is not a generator of Ξµ in general. Note that Kashiwara [4] gave the generator of Ξµ when
P is a Borel subgroup.
    Let ψ ∈ HomUR (g) (UR (g) ⊗UR (p) (Rc ⊗C V (µ)), UR (g) ⊗UR (p) Rc+µ ) and let ξ ∈ Ξµ be the
corresponding element. Then as in Kashiwara [4] we can define a differential operator P (ψ)
on G satisfying

                                        P (ψ)f λ+µ = ξ(λ)f λ

for any character λ of p which can be regarded as a dominant integral weight of g. Here, f λ
denotes the invariant on G corresponding to λ (see Section 3 below) and ξ is regarded as a
function on Hom(p, C).
    In the rest of Introduction we assume that the nilpotent radical n of p is commutative.
Then the pair (L, n) is a prehomogeneous vector space via the adjoint action of L. In this
case there exists exactly one simple root α0 such that the root space gα0 is in n. We denote
the fundamental weight corresponding to α0 by ̟0 .
    We define an element ξ0 ∈ R by
                 Y                                                            
   ξ0 (λ) =                (λ + ρ + ̟0 , λ + ρ + ̟0 ) − (λ + ρ + η, λ + ρ + η) (λ ∈ C̟0 ),
           η∈W t(̟0 )\{̟0 }

where W t(̟0 ) is the set of the highest weights of irreducible l-submodules of V (̟0 ), and ρ
is the half sum of positive roots of g.

Theorem 0.1. We have ξ0 = ξ̟0 , and the ideal Ξ̟0 of R is generated by ξ0 .

    We denote by ψ0 the homomorphism satisfying ψ0 ι = ξ0 id.
    Let n− be the nilpotent part of the parabolic subalgebra of g opposite to p. We can define
a constant coefficient differential operator P ′ (ψ0 ) on n− ≃ exp(n− ) by

                              (P (ψ0 )f )|exp(n− ) = P ′ (ψ0 )(f |exp(n− ) ).


Theorem 0.2. If the prehomogeneous vector space (L, n) is regular, then P ′ (ψ0 ) corresponds
to the unique irreducible relative invariant of (L, n), and b(s) = ξ0 (s̟0 ) is its b-function.


                                                    2
    Moreover, using the commutative diagram (0.1) for ξ0 and ψ0 we give a new proof of
the following criterion of the irreducibility of the generalized Verma module due to Suga [9],
Gyoja [1], Wachi [11]:

    U (g) ⊗U (p) Cs0̟0 is irreducible ⇐⇒ ξ0 ((s0 − m)̟0 ) 6= 0 for any positive integer m.

1    Prehomogeneous Vector Spaces
In this section we recall some basic facts on prehomogeneous vector spaces (see Sato and
Kimura [7]).

Definition 1.1. (i) For a connected algebraic group G over the complex number field C
    and a finite dimensional G-module V , the pair (G, V ) is called a prehomogeneous vector
    space if there exists a Zariski open orbit in V .

 (ii) We denote the ring of polynomial functions on V by C[V ]. A nonzero element f ∈ C[V ]
      is called a relative invariant of a prehomogeneous vector space (G, V ) if there exists a
      character χ of G such that f (gv) = χ(g)f (v) for any g ∈ G and v ∈ V .

 (iii) A prehomogeneous vector space is called regular if there exists a relative invariant f
       such that the Hessian Hf = det(∂ 2 f /∂xi ∂xj ) is not identically zero, where {xi } is a
       coordinate system of V .

     We call algebraically independent relative invariants f1 , f2 , . . . , fl basic relative invariants
if for any relative invariant f there exist c ∈ C and mi ∈ Z such that f = cf1m1 · · · flml .
     Assume that (G, V ) is a prehomogeneous vector space such that G is reductive. Then
the dual space V ∗ of V is also a prehomogeneous vector space by hgv ∗ , vi = hv ∗ , g−1 vi, where
h , i is the natural pairing of V ∗ and V . If f ∈ C[V ] is a relative invariant of (G, V ) with
character χ, then there exists a relative invariant f ∗ of (G, V ∗ ) with character χ−1 . For
h ∈ C[V ∗ ] we define a constant coefficient differential operator h(∂) by

                                 h(∂) exphv ∗ , vi = h(v ∗ ) exphv ∗ vi,

where v ∈ V and v ∗ ∈ V ∗ . Then there exists a polynomial b(s) ∈ C[s] such that

                                         f ∗ (∂)f s+1 = b(s)f s .

This polynomial is called the b-function of f . It is known that deg b = deg f (see [6]).


2    Generalized Universal Verma Modules
Let g be a simple Lie algebra over C with Cartan subalgebra h. Let ∆ ⊂ h∗ be the root
system and W ⊂ GL(h) the Weyl group. For α ∈ ∆ we denote the corresponding root space


                                                    3
by gα . We denote the set of positive roots by ∆+ and the set of simple roots by {αi }i∈I0 ,
where I0 is an index set. Let ρ be the half sum of positive roots of g. We set
                                     M
                              n± =       g±α , b± = h ⊕ n± .
                                         α∈∆+

For i ∈ I0 let hi ∈ h be the simple coroot and ̟i ∈ h∗ the fundamental weight corresponding
to i. We denote the longest element of W by w0 . Let ( , ) be the W -invariant nondegenerate
symmetric
     P      bilinear form on h∗ . We denote the irreducible g-module with highest weight
µ ∈ i∈I0 Z≥0 ̟i by V (µ) and its highest weight vector by vµ . For a Lie algebra a we denote
the enveloping algebra of a by U (a).
    For a subset I ⊂ I0 we set
                          X                               M

Let WI be the subgroup of W generated by the simple reflections corresponding to i ∈ I. We
denote the longest element of WI by wI . Let h∗I,+ be the set of dominant integral weights in
h∗I . For µ ∈ h∗I we define a one-dimensional U (p+
                                                  I )-module CI,µ by

                                                  I )(h − µ(h)) + U (pI )(n ∩ lI ) .

We denote the canonical generator of CI,µ by 1µ . Set MI (µ) = U (g) ⊗U (p+ ) CI,µ. We denote
                                                    P                 P       I

   Let G be a connected simply-connected simple algebraic group with Lie algebra g. We
denote the subgroups of G corresponding to h, b± , lI , n±          ±        ±
                                                         I by T, B , LI , NI respectively.
   Let RI be the symmetric algebra of hI , and define a linear map c : h → RI as the
composite of the natural projection from h to hI and the natural injection from hI to RI .
Set URI (a) = RI ⊗C U (a) for a Lie algebra a.
   We set for µ ∈ h∗I
                       .               X                                                    

                                          h∈h

We denote the canonical generator of RI,c+µ by 1c+µ .

Definition 2.1. For µ ∈ h∗I we call MRI (c + µ) = URI (g) ⊗UR (p+ ) RI,c+µ a generalized

universal Verma module.



                                                  4
   Note that MR∅ (c) is the universal Verma module in Kashiwara [4]. For λ ∈ h∗I we regard
C as an RI -module by c(hi )1 = λ(hi ). Then we have

                                         C ⊗RI MRI (c + µ) = MI (λ + µ).

   The next lemma is obvious.

Lemma 2.3. For µ1 , µ2 ∈ i∈I Z≥0 ̟i + j ∈I    / Z̟j we define a function pµ1 ,µ2 on hI by

Proof. The action of the Casimir element of U (g) on URI (g) ⊗UR (p+ ) (RI,c ⊗C W (µ)) is
                                                                        I I
given by the multiplication by pµ ∈ RI , where pµ (λ) = (λ + ρ + µ, λ + ρ + µ) − (ρ, ρ) for
λ ∈ h∗I . Using this action, we can easily check that pµ1 ,µ2 = pµ1 − pµ2 is an annihilator.

Lemma 2.4. For any      P µ ∈ hI,+ there
                                     P exist pI -submodules F1 , F2 , . . . , Fr of V (µ) and weights
η1 , η2 , . . . , ηr−1 ∈ i∈I Z≥0 ̟i + i∈I0 \I Z̟i satisfying the following conditions:

  (i) Cvµ = F1 ( F2 ( · · · ( Fr = V (µ).

 (ii) Fi+1 /Fi ≃ W (ηi )⊕Ni for some positive integer Ni .

(iii) ηi 6= ηj for i 6= j.

Proof. For a non-negative integer m we set
                              X             X                  M
    P (m) = {λ ∈ h∗ | µ − λ =     mi αi and   mi = m} and Vm =   V (µ)λ ,
                                               i∈I0                 i∈I
                                                                     /                                   λ∈P (m)

where V (µ)λ is the weight space of V (µ) with weight λ. Then Vm is an lI -module, and we
have the irreducible decomposition

                                  Vm = W̃ (ηm,1 )⊕Nm,1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ W̃ (ηm,tm )⊕Nm,tm

                                                                5
where W̃ (η) is the irreducible lI -module with highest weight η, and ηm,i 6= ηm,j for i 6= j.
For 1 ≤ i ≤ tm we define a p+I -submodule Fm,i of V (µ) by

                 Fm,i = V0 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vm−1 ⊕ W̃ (ηm,1 )⊕Nm,1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ W̃ (ηm,i )⊕Nm,i .

Then we have the sequence

        Cvµ = F0,1 ( · · · ( Fm−1,tm−1 ( Fm,1 ( Fm,2 ( · · · ( Fm,tm ( · · · ( Fr,tr = V (µ).

It is clear that the above sequence satisfies the conditions (ii) and (iii).

   For µ ∈ h∗I,+ , we fix the sequence {F1 , F2 , . . . , Fr } of p+
                                                                   I -submodules of V (µ) satisfying

the conditions of Lemma 2.4, and set ξµ = i=1 pµ,ηi ∈ RI .

Theorem 2.5. For µ ∈ h∗I,+ we have ξµ ∈ Ξµ .

In particular ψr ιµ = ξµ . Therefore ξµ ∈ Ξµ .

Let ψµ be a homomorphism from URI (g) ⊗UR (p+ ) (RI,c ⊗C V (µ)) to MRI (c + µ) satisfying
                                                I I
ψµ ιµ = ξµ . Note that ψµ is non-zero since ξµ 6= 0.
Remark 2.6. (i) In general ξµ is not a generator of the ideal Ξµ . For example let g be a
    simple Lie algebra of type G2 . We take the simple roots α1 and α2 such that α1 is short.
    If I = {2} and µ = ̟1 , then we have ξµ = (c(h1 ) + 1)(c(h1 ) + 2)(c(h1 ) + 3)(2c(h1 ) + 5)
    up to constant multiple. But (c(h1 ) + 1)(2c(h1 ) + 5) ∈ Ξµ .

 (ii) For I = ∅ it is shown in Kashiwara [4] that Ξµ is generated by
                                                       µ(hα )−1

      where hα is the coroot corresponding to α.

Let λ be a dominant integral weight. We regard the dual space V (λ)∗ as a left g-module via
hxv ∗ , vi = hv ∗ , −xvi for x ∈ g, v ∗ ∈ V (λ)∗ and v ∈ V (λ). We denote the lowest weight vector
of V (λ)∗ by vλ∗ . We normalize vλ∗ by hvλ∗ , vλ i = 1.
Definition 3.1. We define a regular function f λ on G by f λ (g) = hvλ∗ , gvλ i.
    For b± ∈ B ± and g ∈ G we have

where λ± is the character of B ± corresponding to λ. This function f λ is called B − × B + -

Theorem 3.2. Let µ ∈ h∗I,+ and ψ ∈ HomUR (g) (URI (g)⊗UR (p+ ) (RI,c ⊗C V (µ)), MRI (c+µ)).

4    Commutative Parabolic Type
In the remainder of this paper we assume that

                                              I = I0 \ {i0 }
                                                P
and that the highest root θ of g is in αi0 + i6=i0 Z≥0 αi . Then it is known that [n±           ±
                                                                                           I , nI ] = {0}
and the pairs (LI , n±I ) are prehomogeneous vector spaces via the adjoint action, which are
called of commutative parabolic type. The all pairs (g, i0 ) of commutative parabolic type are
given by the Dynkin diagrams of Fig. 1. Here the white vertex corresponds to i0 .
    The pairs (g, i0 ) such that the corresponding prehomogeneous vector spaces are regular
are as follows: (A2n−1 , n), (Bn , 1), (Cn , n), (Dn , 1), (D2n , 2n) and (E7 , 7). Then it is seen that
w0 αi0 = −αi0 .
    Since n−                                                 +
             I is identified with the dual space of nI via the Killing form, the symmetric
algebra S(nI ) is isomorphic to C[nI ]. By the commutativity of n−
              −                         +                                                  −
                                                                           I we have S(nI ) = U (nI ).
                                                                                                      −
            +                           −
Hence C[nI ] is identified with U (nI ).

Let r = r(g) be the index such that Γr(g)−1 6= ∅ and Γr(g) = ∅. Note that (γi , γP    j ) = 0 for
i 6= j. It is known that all γi have the same length (see Moore [5]). Set h = ri=1 Chγi ,

where hγi is the coroot corresponding to γi . For 1 ≤ i ≤ r we set λi = −(γ1 + · · · + γi ). Then

  (i) β|h− = 0. Then β ± γi ∈

Lemma 4.3. If (LI , n+
                     I ) is not regular, then j ∈ I such that αj |h− = − 2 |h− is unique.

Proof. Assume that for j1 6= j2 we have αj1 = αj2 = − γ2r on h− . Let h ∈ h− . Since
(αj1 + αj2 )(h) = −γr (h), αj1 + αj2 ∈   / ∆ by Lemma 4.2. So we have (αj1 , αj2 ) = 0. Since
                                                              ∈ ∆. In particular β ∈ ∆+ \ ∆I .
(γr , αj1 ) > 0 and (γr + αj1 , αj2 ) > 0, β = γr + αj1 + αj2 P
For any 1 ≤ k ≤ r, (β − γk )(h) = −γk (h), hence β − γk ∈ i∈I Z≥0 αi is not a root. Clearly
β + γk ∈  / ∆. Therefore β ∈ Γr+1 . But by definition Γr+1 = ∅. Thus j1 = j2 .

Lemma 4.4. wI λr = w0 ̟i0 − ̟i0 .

Proof. Assume that (LI , n+   I ) is regular. Then we have wI (w0 ̟i0 − ̟i0 ) = −2wI ̟i0 =
−2̟i0 . By using Lemma 4.2 we can check λr (hi ) = −2δi,i0 easily (see Wachi [11]). Hence
λr = −2̟i0 , and the statement holds. Next we assume that (LI , n+    I ) is not regular. Then
                                                 γr
there exists an index j0 ∈ I such that αj0 = − 2 as functions on h− . By Lemma 4.3 this
index j0 is unique. Similarly to the regular case we have λr = ̟j0 − 2̟i0 . Let j0′ ∈ I
such that wI w0 αi0 = αj0′ . Then we have wI (w0 ̟i0 − ̟i0 ) = ̟j0′ − 2̟i0 , and we can check
γr + αj0′ ∈ ∆ by the direct calculation. Hence αj0′ = − γ2r on h− from Lemma 4.2. Therefore
we have j0′ = j0 .

where I(µ) is an irreducible lI -submodule of U (n−
                                                  I ) with highest weight µ.

     Let fi ∈ U (n−                                                     −
                  I ) be the highest weight vector of I(λi ). Since U (nI ) is naturally identified
with the symmetric algebra S(n−              determine the degree of f ∈ U (n−
                                  I ), we canP
                                                                                                 −
                                                                                 I ). If f ∈ U (nI )
is a weight vector with weight µ ∈ −dαi0 + i∈I Z≤0 αi , then f is homogeneous and deg f = d.
In particular deg fi = i.
     For µ ∈ h∗I,+ we take the lowest weight vector vw0 µ of V (µ). Then the URI (g)-module
URI (g) ⊗UR (p+ ) (RI,c ⊗C V (µ)) is generated by 1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vw0 µ . There exists a non-zero
            I   I
element uµ ∈ URI (n−    I ) such that ψµ (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vw0 µ ) = uµ ⊗ 1c+µ , where ψµ is a URI (g)-
module homomorphism defined in Section 2. Since y(1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vw0 µ ) = 0 for any y ∈ lI ∩ n− ,
uµ ∈ URI (n−I ) is a lowest weight vector with weight w0 µ − µ as an ad(lI )-module. By Lemma
4.5 such a lowest weight vector is unique up to constant multiple. Therefore uµ = aµ u0µ where
aµ ∈ RI \ {0} and u0µ ∈ U (n−  I ) is the unique lowest weight vector with weight w0 µ − µ.
    If x(1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vw0 µ ) = 0 for x ∈ URI (g), then we have xu0µ ⊗ 1c+µ = 0 since aµ 6= 0. Hence
we can define a URI (g)-module homomorphism ψµ0 from URI (g) ⊗UR (p+ ) (RI,c ⊗C V (µ)) to
                                                                         I I
MRI (c + µ) by

                               ψµ0 (x(1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vw0 µ )) = xu0µ ⊗ 1c+µ

for any x ∈ URI (g). We set ξµ0 = ψµ0 ιµ ∈ Ξµ .
    Conversely, from the uniqueness of u0µ we have

              ψ(1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vw0 µ ) = au0µ ⊗ 1c+µ = aψµ0 (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vw0 µ ) (a ∈ RI )
                                                                       
for any ψ ∈ HomUR (g) URI (g) ⊗UR (p+ ) (RI,c ⊗C V (µ)), MRI (c + µ) . Therefore we have the
                  I                 I I
following.

Proposition 4.6. Let µ ∈ h∗I,+ . We have Ξµ = RI ξµ0 .

                                                11
    We call the above homomorphism ψµ0 the minimal map in this paper.
    Let f˜r be the lowest weight vector of the irreducible lI -module generated by fr .

Proposition 4.7. Let µ = m̟i0 ∈ h∗I,+ . Under the identification exp : n−    −
                                                                        I ≃ NI we have

                                 (P̃µ (ψµ0 )ϕ)|n− = f˜r (∂)m (ϕ|n− ).
                                                 I                I


Proof. Let {vi }0≤i≤n be a basis of V (µ) consisting of weight vectors such that vn has the
lowest weight w0 µ. We denote the dual basis by {vi∗ }. We define elements Yi′ ∈ URI (n−
                                                                                       I ) by
  0                   ′                      ′
ψµ (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vi ) = Yi ⊗ 1c+µ . Set Yi = π(Yi ) Then we have
                                                 n
                                                 X
                            (P̃µ (ψµ0 )ϕ)(g) =     hgvi∗ , vn i(R(Yi )ϕ)(g).
                                                 i=0

For g ∈ NI− we have hgvi∗ , vn i = δi,n . Therefore it is sufficient to show that

(4.1)                                     R(Yn ) = f˜rm (∂)

By the definition of ψµ0 , Yn is the lowest weight vector of ad(lI )-module U (n−
                                                                                I ) with weight
w0 µ − µ = m(w0 ̟i0 − ̟i0 ). By Lemma 4.4 the weight of f˜r is w0 ̟i0 − ̟i0 . Hence we have
Yn = f˜rm up to constant multiple. Since n−    I is commutative, we have R(y) = y(∂) for any
y ∈ U (n−
        I ). Hence the  equation   (4.1) holds.

    For 1 ≤ p ≤ r = r(g) we set
                                             γj + γk
                ∆+           +
                 (p) = {β ∈ ∆ | β|h− =               |h− for some 1 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ p}.

                                                                                      P
By Lemma 4.2 we have ∆+      +                           ±            ±
                      (p) ⊂ ∆ \∆I . We define subspaces n(p) of g by n(p) =               β∈∆+     g±β .
                                                                                             (p)
Set l(p) = [n+      −
             (p) , n(p) ] and I(p) = {i ∈ I | gαi ⊂ l(p) }. Then we have the following.

Lemma 4.8 (see Wallach [12] and Wachi [11]). Set g(p) = n−                  +
                                                              (p) ⊕ l(p) ⊕ n(p) . Then g(p) is a
simple subalgebra of g with simple roots {αi0 } ⊔ {αi | i ∈ I(p) }, and the pair (g(p) , i0 ) is of
regular commutative parabolic type. For any 1 ≤ j ≤ p we have fj ∈ U (n−        (p) ), and fp is a
basic relative invariant of (L(p) , n+
                                     (p) ), where L(p) is the subgroup of LI corresponding to l(p) .

    This fact will be used in the subsequent sections.


5       Regular Type
In this section we assume that the prehomogeneous vector space (LI , n±  I ) is regular. We take
γi , λi and fi (1 ≤ i ≤ r = r(g)) as in Section 4. Then we have w0 ̟i0 = −̟i0 and the highest
weight vector fr ∈ U (n−             +                                                   +
                           I ) ≃ C[nI ] is the unique basic relative invariant of (LI , nI ) with
                                          −
character 2̟i0 . In particular fr ∈ U (nI ) is also the lowest weight vector as an lI -module.


                                                     12
Proposition 5.1. Let b(s) be the b-function of the basic relative invariant of (LI , n−
                                                                                      I ). Then
for m ∈ Z>0 we have
                            0
                           ξm̟ i
                                 (s̟i0 ) = b(s + m − 1)b(s + m − 2) · · · b(s)
                               0


up to constant multiple.

Proof. For any l ∈ LI and n ∈ n−
                               I we have

         f˜̟i0 (l exp(n)l−1 ) = (w0 ̟i0 − ̟i0 )(l)f˜̟i0 (exp(n)) = −2̟i0 (l)f˜̟i0 (exp(n)).

Thus f˜̟i0 |n− is the basic relative invariant of (LI , n−                             −    −
                                                         I ) under the identification nI ≃ NI .
             I
Hence we have

  fr (∂)m f˜(m+s)̟i0 |n− = fr (∂)m (f˜̟i0 |n− )s+m = b(s + m − 1)b(s + m − 2) · · · b(s)f˜s̟i0 |n− .
                       I                     I                                                   I


From Corollary 3.4 we have
                                     0
                            P̃m̟i0 (ψm̟ i
                                          )f˜(s+m)̟i0 = ξm̟
                                                         0
                                                            i
                                                              (s̟i0 )f˜s̟i0 .
                                         0                    0


Therefore the statement holds by Proposition 4.7.
                                                          0
   In the rest of this section we shall show that ξ̟i0 = ξ̟   up to constant multiple.

Lemma 5.2. For any 1 ≤ j ≤ r we have wI γj = γr−j+1 .

Proof. By Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 we have γr + αi ∈              / ∆ for any i ∈ I. Therefore γr is the
highest weight of the irreducible ad(lI )-module n+     I .   Since αi0 = γ1 is the lowest weight of
n+
 I  , w  γ
        I 1  =  γr .  Let 1 <  i ≤  [ r
                                      2 ]. Assume  that w I j = γr−j+1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ i − 1. Since
                                                             γ
j 6= i, we have γr−i+1 ± wI γj = γr−i+1 ± γr−j+1 ∈     / ∆ ∪ {0}. Hence wI γr−i+1 ± γj ∈  / ∆ ∪ {0},
and we have wI γr−i+1 ∈ Γi . By definition γi ≤ wI γr−i+1 . So we have wI γi ≥ γr−i+1 . Let
us show that wI γi ≤ γr−i+1 . By Lemma 4.2 there exist γk and γl such that k ≤ l and
wI γi (h) = γk +γ                       −
                2 (h) for any h ∈ h . In particular (wI γi , γl ) > 0. Now we have (wI γi , γm ) =
                   l

(γi , wI γm ) = (γi , γr−m+1 ) = 0 for r − i + 2 ≤ m ≤ r. Hence l ≤ r − i + 1. Since (wI γi , γl ) > 0,
γl − wI γi ∈ ∆ ∪ {0}. For h ∈ h− we have (γl − wI γi )(h) = γl −γ           2 (h). By Lemma 4.2
                                                                              k

                 +
γl − wI γi ∈ ∆ ∪ {0}. Therefore we have wI γi ≤ γl ≤ γr−i+1 .

   Hence the lowest weight wI λr−1 of the irreducible component I(λr−1 ) of U (n−
                                                                                I ) is λr +αi0 .

Lemma 5.3. For any 1 ≤ p ≤ r = r(g) we have

                    ei0 fp ⊗ 1c+µ ∈ URI (lI ∩ n− )(fp−1 ⊗ 1c+µ ) ⊂ MRI (c + µ),

where ei0 ∈ gαi0 \ {0}.




                                                   13
Proof. By Lemma 4.8 it is sufficient to show that the statement holds for p = r. We define
y ∈ URI (n−
          I ) by

                                    ei0 (fr ⊗ 1c+µ ) = y ⊗ 1c+µ .

Since fr is the lowest weight vector of the ad(lI )-module U (n−                    −
                                                               I ) and [ei0 , lI ∩ n ] = {0}, y is
the lowest weight vector as an ad(lI )-module. Moreover the weight of y is λr + αi0 = wI λr−1 ,
which is the lowest weight of the irreducible component I(λr−1 ) = ad(U (lI ))fr−1 . Therefore
y ⊗ 1c+µ ∈ URI (lI ∩ n− )(fr−1 ⊗ 1c+µ ).

                                                             P
Corollary 5.4. Let u ∈ U (n+ ) with weight kαi0 +                i∈I   mi αi . Then we have

                             ufr ⊗ 1c+µ ∈ URI (lI ∩ n− )(fr−k ⊗ 1c+µ ).

Proof. We shall show the statement by the induction on k. If k = 0, then thePstatement
is clear. Assume that k > 0, and the statement holds for k − 1. We write u = j uj ei0 u′j ,
                                                                                        P
where uj ∈ U (lI ∩ n+ ) and u′j ∈ U (n+ ). Then the weight of u′j is in (k − 1)αi0 + i∈I Z≥0 αi ,
and hence we have
                    X
       ufr ⊗ 1c+µ ∈      uj ei0 URI (lI ∩ n− )(fr−k+1 ⊗ 1c+µ ) ⊂ URI (lI )(ei0 fr−k+1 ⊗ 1c+µ ).
                      j

Here note that [ei0 , URI (lI ∩ n− )] = 0. By Lemma 5.3 we have

                          ei0 fr−k+1 ⊗ 1c+µ ∈ URI (lI ∩ n− )(fr−k ⊗ 1c+µ ).

Therefore we obtain

              ufr ⊗ 1c+µ ∈ URI (lI )(fr−k ⊗ 1c+µ ) = URI (lI ∩ n− )(fr−k ⊗ 1c+µ ).



                                    Qr
Theorem 5.5. We have ξ̟i0 =            j=1 p̟i0 ,λj +̟i0   ∈ C × ξ̟

                                                                    i  0

Proof. Let v−̟i0 be the lowest weight vector of V (̟i0 ). Since fr is the lowest weight vector
of U (n−                               0
       I ) with weight −2̟0 , we have ψ̟i (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ v−̟i0 ) = fr ⊗ 1c+̟i0 . It is clear that
                                               0
                                                                       X

Set P (j) = {λ | ̟i0 − λ ∈ jαi0 +        i∈IZ≥0 αi }. We define an lI -submodule Vj of V (̟i0 ) by

(cf. Section 2). Note that Vj 6= 0 for 0 ≤ j ≤ r. We take the irreducible decomposition of Vj

                                  Vj = W̃ (ηj,1 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ W̃ (ηj,tj ),

                                                   14
where W̃ (η) is an irreducible lI -module with highest weight η. Let vj,k be the highest weight
                                      element uj,k ∈ U (n+ ) such that uj,k v−̟i0 = vj,k . Then
vector of W̃ (ηj,k ). There exists an P
the weight of uj,k is in (r − j)αi0 + i∈I Z≥0 αi . By Corollary 5.4 we have
 0                            0
ψ̟ i
     (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vj,k ) = uj,k ψ̟ i
                                  (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ v−̟i0 ) = uj,k fr ⊗ 1c+̟i0 ∈ URI (lI ∩ n− )fj ⊗ 1c+̟i0 .
    0                            0

Since vj,k is the highest weight vector, we have
                               0
                              ψ̟ i
                                   (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vj,k ) ∈ RI (fj ⊗ 1c+̟i0 ).
                                     0

In particular ηj,k = λj + ̟i0 , and the irreducible decomposition of V (̟i0 ) as an lI -module
is given by
                                                  r
                                                  M
                                     V (̟i0 ) =         W̃ (λj + ̟i0 )⊕Nj ,
                                                  j=0
                                                   Q
where we set λ0 = 0. Therefore we have ξ̟i0 = rj=1 p̟i0 ,λj +̟i0 , which is regarded as a
polynomial function on C̟i0 . Since deg p̟i0 ,λj +̟i0 = 1 for j ≥ 1, we have deg ξ̟i0 = r.
Now we have deg ξ̟0    = deg b(s) = deg fr = r. From Proposition 4.6 we have ξ̟i0 ∈ C× ξ̟
                                                                                        0 ,
                    i0                                                                    i0
hence the statement holds.
                                                                                      γ −γ
     For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r we set ci,j = ♯{α ∈ ∆I ∩ ∆+ | α|h− = j 2 i |h− }. It is known that
                                  γ +γ
ci,j = ♯{α ∈ ∆+ \ ∆I | α|h− = j 2 i |h− } and this number is independent of i or j (see [13]).
Set c0 = ci,j . Then we have (2ρ, γj ) = d0 (1 + c0 (j − 1)), where d0 = (αi0 , αi0 ). In particular
(2ρ, λj ) = −jd0 (1 + j−1
                       2 c0 ). Since (γi , γj ) = δi,j d0 , we have (̟i0 , ̟i0 ) = (λj + ̟i0 , λj + ̟i0 )
for 1 ≤ j ≤ r. Hence we have
                                                                                         j−1
                 p̟i0 ,λj +̟i0 (s̟i0 ) = −2(s̟i0 + ρ, λj ) = jd0 (s + 1 +                    c0 ).
                                                                                          2

6       Non-regular Type
Assume that the prehomogeneous vector space (LI , n+         I ) is not regular. We take γi , λi and
fi (1 ≤ i ≤ r = r(g)) as in Section 4. For µ = m̟i0 ∈ h∗I,+ we denote by ṽµ the highest
weight vector of the irreducible lI -submodule of V (µ) generated by the lowest weight vector
of V (µ). The weight of v˜µ is wI µ. We take u ∈ URI (n−              0
                                                             I ) as ψµ (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ ṽµ ) = u ⊗ 1c+µ . By
definition of ψµ0 we have u ∈ U (n−                                                           −
                                     I ). Moreover u is the highest weight vector of U (nI ) with
weight wI w0 µ − µ = wI (w0 µ − µ). By Lemma 4.4 we have wI (w0 µ − µ) = mλr . Therefore
we have u = frm . Set ξµ0 = ψµ0 ιµ ∈ RI .
    We define subalgebras g(r) , l(r) and n±                                       +           +
                                             (r) of g as in Lemma 4.8. We set p̃ = l(r) ⊕ n(r) . We
denote by Ṽ (µ) the irreducible g(r) -module with highest weight µ. Let I˜0 be an index set of
simple roots of g(r) , that is, I˜0 = I(r) ⊔ {i0 } (see Lemma 4.8). We set I˜ = I(r) and g̃ = g(r)
                                                          P            P
for simplicity. Let R̃ be an enveloping algebra of i∈I˜0 Chi / i∈I˜ Chi . Since we have the
canonical identification RI ≃ R̃, a URI (g̃)-submodule

                                M̃ (c + µ) = URI (g̃) ⊗UR           (p̃+ )   RI,c+µ
                                                                I

of MRI (c + µ) is a generalized universal Verma module associated with g̃. We define an
element ξ̃µ0 of R̃ ≃ RI by the multiplication map on M̃ (c + µ) induced by the minimal map

                             ψ̃µ0 : URI (g̃) ⊗UR       (p̃+ )   (RI,c ⊗C Ṽ (µ)) → M̃ (c + µ).
                                                   I

Then we have the following.
Proposition 6.1.              (i) Under the identification R̃ ≃ RI we have ξµ0 = ξ̃µ0 for µ ∈ h∗I,+ .

 (ii) ξ̟i0 ∈ C× ξ̟
                 0 .
                   i     0

Proof. (i) We have U (g̃)vµ ≃ Ṽ (µ), and ṽµ is its lowest weight vector. Since we have
    ψ̃µ0 (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ ṽµ ) = frm ⊗ 1c+µ , the restriction ψµ0 on URI (g̃) ⊗UR (p̃+ ) (RI,c ⊗C U (g̃)vµ )
                                                                                            I
        is ψ̃µ0 . Hence we have ξµ0 ⊗ 1c+µ = ψµ0 (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vµ ) = ψ̃µ0 (1 ⊗ 1c ⊗ vµ ) = ξ̃µ0 ⊗ 1c+µ .
                                                                 0
 (ii) Since the pair (g̃, i0 ) is of regular type, we have deg ξ̟̃    = r (see the proof of Theorem
                                                                   i0
      5.5). Similarly to the proof of Theorem 5.5 we can show that deg ξ̟i0 = r. By (i) we
                0
      have deg ξ̟   = deg ξ̟i0 . Since Ξ̟i0 = RI ξ̟   0   and ξ̟i0 ∈ Ξ̟i0 , we have ξ̟i0 ∈ C× ξ̟0 .
                  i  0                                  i               0                         i     0



    As a result, we have the following.
Theorem 6.2. For any pair (g, i0 ) of commutative parabolic type , the ideal Ξ̟i0 is generated
by ξ̟i0 .


7       Irreducibility of Verma Modules
Let (LI , n−
           I ) be a prehomogeneous vector space of commutative parabolic type. Set {i0 } =

    We take fi ∈ U (n−

                                                t

    This lemma is proved by direct calculations for each case. In [3] there are explicit decom-
positions of quantum counterparts fq,r of fr satisfying the properties of Lemma 7.2. We can
get the decomposition (7.1) from the quantum counterpart via q = 1. For example, in the
case of type A, fr is a determinant and the decomposition (7.1) corresponds to a cofactor
decomposition.

Corollary 7.4. Let K(6= 0) be a submodule of MI (λ) for λ ∈ h∗I . We have frn MI (λ) ⊂ K
for n ≫ 0.
Proof. If K = MI (λ), then the statement is clear. Assume that {0} = 6 K ( MI (λ). By
Lemma 4.5 any highest weight vector of MI (λ) as an lI -module is given by the following
form:
                                                    f1a1 · · · frar ⊗ 1λ .
Since K has the highest weight vector as an lI -module, there exists an element f1a1 · · · frar ⊗
1λ ∈ K such that (a1 , . . . , ar ) 6= 0. By Proposition 7.3 for n ≫ 0 there exists u ∈ U (n− )
such that
                                      frn ⊗ 1λ = u(f1a1 · · · frar ⊗ 1λ ) ∈ K.
Hence for any y ∈ U (n−
                      I ) we have

                                          frn (y ⊗ 1λ ) = yfrn ⊗ 1λ ∈ K,
and the statement holds.

                               MRI (c + µ)                                 MRI (c + µ)

                                                                               yµ
(7.2)
                    URI (g) ⊗UR       (p+      (RI,c ⊗C V (µ)) −−−→ MRI (c + µ),
                                  I     I )                          0
                                                                    ψµ

where µ ∈ h∗I,+ .
    Set λ = s0 ̟i0 . We denote the highest weight vector of V (µ) by vµ . Let ṽµ be the
highest weight vector of the irreducible lI -module generated by the lowest weight vector of
g-module V (µ). For a positive integer m, we set µ = µm = m̟i0 . Considering the functor
C ⊗RI ( · ), where C has the RI -module structure via c(hi )1 = (λ − µ)(hi ), we obtain the
following commutative diagram from (7.2):

                                           MI (λ)                           MI (λ)

                                              
                                           ιm y
                                                                             ξ 0 (λ−µ)
                                                                             yµ
                        U (g) ⊗U (p+ ) (CI,λ−µ ⊗C V (µ)) −−−→ MI (λ),
                                       I                               0
                                                                      ψm


where ιm (1 ⊗ 1λ ) = 1 ⊗ 1λ−µ ⊗ vµ and ψm  0 (1 ⊗ 1               m
                                                   λ−µ ⊗ ṽµ ) = fr ⊗ 1λ .
                                                 0
   Assume that MI (λ) is irreducible. Since ψm 6= 0, we have Imψm      0 = M (λ). The weight
                                                                              I
space of U (g) ⊗U (p+ ) (CI,λ−µ ⊗C V (µ)) with weight λ is C(1 ⊗ 1λ−µ ⊗ vµ ), hence there exists
                    I
a ∈ C \ {0} such that
                     0                      0
           1 ⊗ 1λ = ψm (a ⊗ 1λ−µ ⊗ vµ ) = aψm ιm (1 ⊗ 1λ ) = aξµ0 (λ − µ) ⊗ 1λ 6= 0.

By Propositions 5.1 and 6.1 we have

                ξµ0 (λ − µ) = ξ̟
                               0
                                 i
                                              0
                                   (λ − ̟i0 )ξ̟ i
                                                                     0
                                                  (λ − 2̟i0 ) · · · ξ̟ i
                                                                         (λ − m̟i0 ).
                                  0                      0                   0

                   0 (λ − m̟ ) 6= 0 for any m ∈ Z .
Therefore we have ξ̟ i0       i0                  >0
                               0 (λ − m̟ ) 6= 0 for any m ∈ Z . We set
   Conversely, we assume that ξ̟ i        i0                 >0
                                           0


                         N (m) = U (g) ⊗U (p+ ) (CI,λ−µm ⊗C V (µm )).
                                                     I

                         0 (λ − ̟ )ξ 0 (λ − 2̟ ) · · · ξ 0 (λ − m̟ ) 6= 0, we have
Since ξµ0 m (λ − µm ) = ξ̟ i     i0 ̟ i       i0        ̟i        i0
                          0                     0                     0

             0
            ψm (ξµ0 m (λ − µm )−1 ⊗ 1λ−µm ⊗ vµm ) = ξµ0 m (λ − µm )−1 ψm
                                                                       0
                                                                         ιm (1 ⊗ 1λ )
                                                              = 1 ⊗ 1λ .
       0 is surjective, and we have an isomorphism
Hence ψm
                             0
                   N (m)/Kerψm ≃ MI (λ) : 1 ⊗ 1λ−µm ⊗ ṽµm 7→ frm ⊗ 1λ


                                                         18
for any m. Under this identification we have

          1 ⊗ 1λ−µn+1 ⊗ ṽµn+1 = frn+1 ⊗ 1λ = frn (fr ⊗ 1λ ) = frn 1 ⊗ 1λ−µ1 ⊗ ṽµ1 .

Let K 6= 0 be a submodule of MI (λ). By Corollary 7.4 for n ≫ 0 we have

                      1 ⊗ 1λ−µn+1 ⊗ ṽµn+1 = frn 1 ⊗ 1λ−µ1 ⊗ ṽµ1 ∈ K.

Hence we have
                                                 0
                          MI (λ) = N (n + 1)/Kerψn+1
                                 = U (g)1 ⊗ 1λ−µn+1 ⊗ ṽµn+1 ⊂ K.

Therefore K = MI (λ), and MI (λ) is irreducible. We complete the proof of Theorem 7.1.
