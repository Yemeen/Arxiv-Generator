                                             1    Introduction
                                             Let G be a locally compact, σ-compact metrizable group with a right invari-

                                             measures on G. The  R Rconvolution of any two measures µ and λ in P(G) is de-
                                             fined by µ∗λ(f ) =       f (xy)dµ(x)dλ(y) for all continuous bounded functions
                                                           p
                                             on
                                             R G.p Let L (G), ∞ 1 ≤ p < ∞ be the space of all measurable functions f with
                                                |f | < ∞ and L (G) be the space of all (essentially) bounded measurable
                                             functions on G.
                                                  For µ, λ ∈ P(G) and x ∈ G, µλ, xµ and µx denote µ ∗ λ, δx ∗ µ and µ ∗ δx
                                             and µn denotes the n-th convolution power of µ.
                                                                             1
                                                  For µ ∈ P(G)
                                                             R and f ∈ L (G), we define the convolution operator µ ∗ f
                                             by µ ∗ f (x) = f (xy)dµ(y) for all x ∈ G.                            P k
                                                  We now recall that a measure
                                                                         R      µ in P(G) is called ergodic if n1   µ ∗fP→ 0
                                                                                                                      1
                                             for all f ∈ L1 (G) with f = 0 and µ is called weak mixing      R      if n
                                                                                                                         | <
                                             µk ∗ f, g > | → 0 for all g ∈ L∞ (G) and all f ∈ L1 (G) with f = 0.
                                                  It is known that any weak mixing measure is ergodic and also strictly
                                             aperiodic. The converse of this is known as weak mixing problem. Lin and
                                             Wittmann show that strong convergence of µn -averages of unitary representa-
                                             tion gives affirmative answer to weak mixing problem (Theorem 3.1 of [LW]).

                                                                                   1
Thus, the relationship between ergodic and weak mixing is closely related to
the representation theoretic property, called identity excluding. Here we in-
vestigate the class of identity excluding groups. We first observe that for
groups whose connected component of identity is compact, trivial represen-
tation is not weakly contained in any non-trivial irreducible representation
implies identity excluding. Using this observation we prove that (i) motion
groups of totally disconnected nilpotent groups are identity excluding and
(ii) a class of p-adic algebraic groups which includes groups whose solvable
radical is type R and the general affine group has identity excluding prop-
erty. We also show the convergence of averages of unitary representation for
splitable solvable Zariski-connected p-adic algebraic groups.


2    Preliminaries
We introduce notions and prove lemmas that are needed to prove the main
results.

Definition 2.1 A unitary representation of a locally compact group G in
a Hilbert space H is a homomorphism T : G → Bu (H), the space of unitary
operators on H such that for each v ∈ V , the map g 7→ T (g)v is continuous.
For any subgroup H of G and any representation T of H, T |H denotes the
representation of H obtained by restricting T to H. Let I be denote the
trivial irreducible representation.
   Throughout this article by a group we mean a locally compact, σ-compact
metric group and by a representation we mean an unitary representation.

Definition 2.2 We say that a representation T of a group G weakly contains
the trivial representation or I ≺ T if there exists a sequence (vn ) of unit
vectors in H such that ||T (g)vn − vn || → 0 for all g ∈ G: such sequence (vn )
of unit vectors is called approximate fixed point.

Remark 2.1 The standard definition of weak containment of trivial rep-
resentation requires the convergence ||T (g)vn − vn || → 0 to be uniform on
compact subsets of G. It may be seen as follows that our definition is equiv-
alent to the standard definition: if there exists a sequence (vn ) such that
                                                        1
||T
R (g)vn − vn || → 0 for all g ∈ G, then for any f ∈ L (G) with f ≥ 0 and
  f = 1, we have ||T (f )|| = 1 and hence by 1.3, Chapter 3 of [M], T weakly
contains the trivial representation according to the standard definition.

                                      2
Definition 2.3 We say that a group G has identity excluding property if
there is no non-trivial irreducible representation T for which there is a dense
subgroup D of G such that ID ≺ T |D .

Definition 2.4 For any µ ∈ P(G)  R and any representation T of G, the µ-
average Tµ is defined as Tµ (v) = T (g)vdµ(g) for any vector v. It is easy to
see that ||Tµ || ≤ 1.
   We now recall two non-degeneracy conditions for measures on groups
which are necessary for weak mixing.

Definition 2.5 A µ ∈ P(G) is called adapted if the closed subgroup gener-
ated by the support of µ is G and µ is called strictly aperiodic if there is no
proper closed normal subgroup a coset of which contains the support of µ.
    Identity excluding groups was introduced in [JRW] and also considered
in [LW] and [Ra2]. It is shown in [LW] that nilpotent groups are identity
excluding. Also, Lin and Witmann proved that for adapted, strictly aperiodic
measure µ on a group G with identity excluding property,

  1. ||Tµn || → 0 for any non-trivial irreducible unitary representation T ,

  2. (Tµn ) converges strongly for any unitary representation T and

  3. in addition if µ is ergodic, then µ is weak mixing.

   We now prove some lemmas which are needed in the sequel.

Lemma 2.1 Let G be a group and H be a closed abelian normal subgroup of
G such that G/C(H) is finite where C(H) is the centralizer of H. Suppose
T is an irreducible representation of G such that I ≺ T . Then T is trivial
on H.

Proof Let T be an irreducible representation of G in a Hilbert space H.
Suppose I ≺ T . For any character χ of H, define Vχ = {v ∈ H | T (h)v =
χ(h)v for all h ∈ H}. Then it is easy to see that Vχ is a C(H)-invariant
closed subspace of H. Let χ be such that Vχ is a non-trivial subspace. Let
g0 C(H), g1C(H), · · · gk C(H) be a system of coset representative of C(H) in
G with g0 = e. Now for each 0 ≤ i ≤ k, define χi (h) = χ(gi hgi−1 ) for all
h ∈ H. Then each χi is a character of H and T (gi )Vχ = Vχi = Vi , say.


                                      3
Then the orthogonal sum ⊕Vi is a G-invariant closed subspace of H. Thus,
H = ⊕Vi . Since I ≺ T , there exists a i ≥ 0 such that I ≺ Ti where Ti is
the representation of H in Vi given by χi . This shows that χi is trivial and
hence χ is trivial. Thus, T (H) is trivial.

Lemma 2.2 Let G be a group whose connected component of identity is com-
pact and T be an unitary representation of G in a Hilbert space H. Suppose
there is a dense subgroup H of G and a sequence (vn ) of unit vectors in H
such that ||T (g)vn − vn || → 0 for all g ∈ H. Then ||T (g)vn − vn || → 0 for all
g ∈ G. In particular, I 6≺ T for any non-trivial irreducible representation of
G implies G is identity excluding.

Proof Let G0 be the connected component of identity in G. Then G/G0 is
totally disconnected and has compact open subgroups, see Theorem II.7.7 of
[HR]. Since G0 is compact, G itself has compact open subgroups. Let K be
a compact open subgroup of G. Let HK = {v ∈ H | T (K)v = v}. Now for
                                                    ⊥
each n ≥ 1, there exists a an ∈ HK and a bn ∈ HK      such that vn = an + bn .
                              ⊥
It can be easily seen that HK is also T (K)-invariant. This implies that for
g ∈ H ∩ K, ||T (g)vn − vn || = ||T (g)bn − bn || → 0. Since H is dense in G,
H ∩ K is dense in K. We may assume that H is a Borel subgroup of G.
Thus, H ∩ K is a Borel subgroup of K. Since K is metrizable, we can P choose
a countable dense subset E of K P  such that E ⊂ H ∩ K. Let µ = x∈E rx δx
where rx > 0 for all x ∈ E and        rx = 1. Then µ is an adapted, strictly
aperiodic probability measure on K such that µ(H ∩ K) = 1. Let ρ be
                                ⊥
the representation of K in HK     such that ρ(g) is the restriction of T (g) to
HK for any g ∈ K. Then ||(ρkµ − I)bn || → 0 as n → ∞. Suppose ρkµ − I
  ⊥

is not invertible for any k ≥ 1. Then ||ρkµ || = 1 for all k ≥ 1. Since K
is a SIN-group by Theorem 2.11 of [LW], I ≺ ρ. Since K has property
        ⊥
(T ), HK  has a non-trivial T (K)-fixed vector. This is a contradiction. This
shows that (ρkµ − I) is invertible for some k ≥ 1. Thus, bn → 0. Now
for any g ∈ K, ||T (g)vn − vn || = ||T (g)bn − bn || ≤ 2||bn || → 0. Thus,
{g ∈ G | ||T (g)vn − vn || → 0} is a dense subgroup containing an open
subgroup K and hence ||T (g)vn − vn || → 0 for all g ∈ G.


3     Motion groups
We first prove the identity excluding for motion groups of totally disconnected
nilpotent groups.

                                       4
Theorem 3.1 Let G be a split compact extension of a totally disconnected
nilpotent group. Then G has identity excluding property.

Proof Let N be a totally disconnected nilpotent normal subgroup of G
such that G/N is compact. Since G is a split compact extension of N, it
is easy to see that the connected component of G is compact. In view of
Lemma 2.2, it is enough to show that I 6≺ T for any non-trivial irreducible
representation.
    Let T be an irreducible representation of G such that I ≺ T . Let Z be the
center of N. We now prove that T (Z) is trivial. Let K be a compact open
subgroup of Z and define L = ∩g∈G gKg −1 . Then L is a compact normal of
subgroup of G. Since I ≺ T , T (L) has a non-trivial fixed point. Since L is a
normal subgroup of G, space of fixed points for T (L) is a non-trivial T (G)-
invariant subspace. Thus, T (L) is trivial. Since K is a open subgroup of Z,
N(K), the normalizer of K is an open subgroup of G containing N. Since
G/N is compact, N(K) is a open subgroup of finite index in G. Thus, L is a
finite intersection of conjugates of K. Since Z is a normal subgroup of G, L
is a open subgroup of Z. Now by replacing G by G/L, we may assume that
Z is discrete. Let x ∈ Z. There exists a finitely generated normal subgroup
F of G such that x ∈ F ⊂ Z (we may choose F to be the group generated
by the finite set {gxg −1 | g ∈ G}). It is easy to see that Aut (F ) is a discrete
group. Since H ⊂ Z, the center of N and G/N is compact, the centralizer
of F is finite. By Lemma 2.1, T (F ) is trivial. In particular, T (x) is trivial.
Since x ∈ Z is arbitrary, T (Z) is trivial.
    Since N is nilpotent, by using the central series of N, we conclude that
T (N) is trivial. Since any compact group is identity excluding, T (G) itself
is trivial. Thus, G is identity excluding.
   We next prove that finite extension of nilpotent groups are identity ex-
cluding.

Theorem 3.2 Let G be a finite extension of a nilpotent group. Then G is
identity excluding.

Proof Let N be a nilpotent subgroup of G such that G/N is finite. Then
replacing N by a subgroup of N, we may assume that N is a normal subgroup
of G (the subgroup may be chosen to be ∩xNx−1 ).
   Let T be an irreducible representation of G in a Hilbert space H. Suppose
there exists a dense set D of G such that I ≺ T |D . Since G/N is finite, D ∩N

                                        5
is dense in N. Let N0 = N and Ni = [N, Ni−1 ] for all i > 0. Then Nk is
contained in the center of N for some k ≥ 0. Also, D ∩ Nk is dense in Nk .
    We now claim that T is trivial. For any character χ of Nk , we define
Hχ = {v ∈ H | T (g)v = χ(g)v for all g ∈ Nk }. Let C be the centralizer
of Nk in G. Then C is a normal subgroup of finite index in G. Also, Hχ
is C-invariant closed subspace of H. Let χ be such that Hχ is a non-trivial
subspace. Let g0 C, g1 , · · · gk C be a system of coset representative of C in
G with g0 = e. Now for each 0 ≤ i ≤ k, define χi (x) = χ(gi xgi−1 ) for all
x ∈ Nk . Then each χi is a character of Nk and gi Hχ = Hχi = Hi , say. Then
the orthogonal sum ⊕Hi is a T (G)-invariant closed subspace of H. Thus,
H = ⊕Hi . Since I ≺ T |D , there exists a i ≥ 0 such that I ≺ Ti |D∩Nk where
Ti is the representation of Nk in Hi given by χi . This shows that χi is trivial
and hence χ is trivial. Thus, T (Nk ) is trivial. Using the central series of N,
we may prove that T (N) is trivial. Since finite groups are identity excluding,
T itself is trivial.
    We now deduce the following for groups of polynomial growth. We recall
that a compactly generated group G (with Haar measure m) is said to be
of polynomial growth if there exists an integer l > 0 and a constant c > 0
such that m(U n ) ≤ cnl for all n ≥ 1 where U is a compact neighborhood of
identity generating G: see [Gr], [L1] for results on polynomial growth.

Corollary 3.1 Let G be a compactly generated group of polynomial growth.
Suppose the connected component of identity is compact. Then G has identity
excluding property.

Proof Let G be a compactly generated group of polynomial growth. By
Theorem 2 of [L1], there exists a compact normal subgroup K of G such that
G/K is a Lie group of polynomial growth. Suppose the connected component
of identity in G is compact. Then G has a compact open subgroup and hence
G/K also has a compact open subgroup. Since G/K is a Lie group, this
implies that the connected component of identity is a compact open normal
subgroup. Thus, G has a compact open normal subgroup, let it be L. So
for any representation T , the space of T (L)-fixed points are invariant under
G and hence it is enough to show that G/L has identity excluding property.
Since G/L is a discrete group of polynomial growth, by Gromov’s theorem
in [Gr], we get that G/L is a finite extension of a nilpotent group. Now the
result follows from Theorem 3.2.


                                       6
4    p-adic algebraic groups
We first make the following observation:

Proposition 4.1 Let T be an unitary representation of a group G. Suppose
for some f ∈ L1 (G) with f ≥ 0, T (f ) is a compact operator. Then I ≺ T
implies T has a non-trivial fixed point.

Proof Let f ∈ L1 (G) suchR that f ≥ 0 and T (f ) is a compact operator.
Then we may assume that f = 1. Suppose I ≺ T . Then there exists a
sequence (vn ) of unit vectors such that ||T (g)vn − vn || → 0 for all g ∈ G.
This implies that ||vn − T (f )vn || → 0. Since T (f ) is a compact operator,
(T (f )vn ) has a convergent subsequence. By passing to a subsequence we may
assume that T (f )vn → v. Since ||T (f )vn − vn || → 0, vn → v. This implies
that T (G)v = v and ||v|| = 1. Thus, T has a non-trivial fixed point.
    Thus, the above result shows that totally disconnected CCR-groups have
identity excluding property (see [D] for details on CCR-groups). It is known
that only algebraic groups that are CCR are the direct products of a semisim-
ple group and a group of type R ([Li] and [Pu]). Here we prove that p-adic
algebraic groups which are semi-direct product of semi-simple groups and
groups of type R have identity excluding property, that is any p-adic alge-
braic group has identity excluding property if the solvable radical is type R.
By an algebraic group over a local field K of characteristic zero, we mean the
group of K-points of an algebraic group defined over K.

Definition 4.1 We say that a finite-dimensional vector space V over a local
field of characteristic zero is of type RΓ where Γ is a group of automorphisms
of V , if the eigenvalues of each element of Γ are of absolute value one. We
say that a Lie group G is of type RΓ where Γ is a group of Lie automorphisms
of G, if the Lie algebra of G is of type RΓ and a Lie group G is said to be of
type R if G is of type RAd (G) where Ad is the adjoint representation of G:
see [J] for results on type R real Lie groups and [Ra1] for results on p-adic
Lie groups of type R.

Theorem 4.1 Let G be any p-adic algebraic group. Let U be the unipotent
radical of G. Let U0 = U, Ui = [U, Ui−1 ] for i > 0. For any i > 0 and
for any G-invariant subspace W of Ui /Ui+1 define φi,W : G → GL(W ) by
φi,W (g)xUi+1 = gxg −1Ui+1 for all xUi+1 ∈ W ⊂ Ui /Ui+1 . Suppose for each

                                      7
i > 0 and W as above, either φi,W (G) is non-amenable or W is of type
Rφi,W (G) . Then G has identity excluding property.

Remark 4.1 Suppose G is an algebraic subgroup of GL(W ), for some finite-
dimensional vector space W . Suppose G is reductive. Then G is amenable
implies that G has no non-trivial non-compact simple factors. Thus, for
amenable G, W is of type RG if and only if the center of G has no split
torus, that is anisotropic.

Proof Let S be a reductive Levy subgroup of G and U be the unipotent
radical of G. Then G is the semidirect product of S and U. Let Z be the
center of U. Then Z contains Uk where k ≥ 0 is such that Uk 6= (e) but
Uk+1 = (e). Let V = Uk .
    We prove the result by induction on dimension of U. It may be noted
that G/W satisfies the hypothesis for any irreducible G-invariant subspace
W of V . Suppose dim (U) = 0. Then G is a reductive group. Since G is a
CCR-group, G has identity excluding property.
    If dim(U) > 0. Then V is a non-trivial normal subgroup of G. Suppose V
contains a irreducible G-subspace W such that the image of G in GL(W ) is
non-amenable. It is easy to see that the action of G on Ŵ is also irreducible.
By 4.15 and 5.15 of [S], we get that (G, W ) has strong relative property (T )
(see [S] for details). Let T be a irreducible representation of G such that
I ≺ T . Define a representation T1 of the semidirect product of G and W
by T1 ((g, w)) = T (gw). Then I ≺ T1 |G and hence T1 (W ) has a non-trivial
fixed point. So, T (W ) has a non-trivial fixed point. Since W is a normal
subgroup, T (W ) is trivial. Now by induction hypothesis T (G/W ) is trivial
and hence T (G) is trivial.
    Suppose, for any irreducible G-subspace W of V , the image of G in
GL(W ) is amenable. Then by assumption W is of type Rφi,W (G) . This
implies that any split torus of G, centralizes W and since U centralizes W ,
φi,W (G) is compact. Thus, {gxg −1 | g ∈ G} is compact in V for any x ∈ V .
    Suppose G is a p-adic algebraic group, then V is a increasing union of
compact normal subgroups of G. Let (Mi ) be a sequence of compact normal
subgroups of G such that V = ∪Mi and Mi ⊂ Mi+1 for all i > 0. Let T be
an irreducible representation of G such that I ≺ T . Then for each i > 0,
I ≺ T |Mi . For each i > 0, since Mi has property (T ), T (Mi ) has a non-trivial
fixed point. For each i > 0, since Mi is normal in G, the space of fixed points
of T (Mi ) is a non-trivial T (G)-invariant closed subspace. Thus, T (Mi ) is

                                       8
trivial for all i > 0. This shows that T (V ) is trivial. By applying induction
hypothesis to G/V , we get that T is trivial. Thus, by Lemma 2.2, G has
identity excluding property.

Corollary 4.1 Suppose G is a p-adic algebraic group whose solvable radical
is of type R. Then G satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 4.1 and G is identity
excluding.

Proof Suppose for some i > 0, there is an irreducible normal subgroup
W of Ui /Ui+1 such that the image of G in GL(W ) is amenable. Then any
semisimple Levy subgroup of G has only compact orbits in W . Since the
solvable radical is of type R, Gx is compact for any x ∈ W . Thus, G satisfies
the hypothesis of Theorem 4.1.
   The following is easy to verify.

Corollary 4.2 The semidirect product of GLn (Qp ) and Qnp (for n > 1) ver-
ifies the hypothesis of Theorem 4.1 but its solvable radical is not of type R.
   We now prove a partial converse to Theorem 4.1.

Theorem 4.2 Let G be a p-adic algebraic group and U be the unipotent
radical of G. Suppose the solvable radical of G is not of type R and U is of
type RL where L is a semisimple Levy subgroup of G. Then G is not identity
excluding.

Proof It is enough to prove the result for a quotient group of G. Let S
be the solvable radical of G. Since S is not of type R, let U ′ = [U, U], then
S/U ′ is also not of type R. Thus, replacing G by G/U ′ , we may assume
that unipotent radical is abelian. Since S is not of type R, there exists an
element x ∈ S such that the subspace {v ∈ U | xn vx−n → e} is non-empty
and it is G-invariant. Thus, again replacing G by a quotient of G, we may
assume that the split torus As of S is atleast one-dimensional and for any
x ∈ As \ K, x or x−1 contracts U for some compact subgroup K of As .
    Now, let χ be a non-trivial character of U. Let H be the stabilizer of χ
in the reductive Levy part of G. Define ρ on HU by ρ(hu) = χ(u). Then
ρ defines an irreducible unitary representation of HU. Now by Mackey’s
normal subgroup analysis (see [Ma1] and [Ma2]), the induced representation
T of G from ρ is irreducible. We now claim that I ≺ T . Let G1 = As HU. By
assumption, the non-compact simple factors of L centralizes U. This implies

                                      9
that G/G1 is compact. Let T1 be the induced representation of G1 from ρ.
Then T is the induced representation from T1 , by Chapter III, 1.11 of [M], it
is enough to show that I ≺ T1 . As in example of [JRW], we can prove that
I ≺ T1 .


5    Convergence of representation averages for
     some solvable algebraic groups
Lin and Witmann show that the convergence of (Tµn ) in the strong operator
topology implies that any strictly aperiodic ergodic measure is weak mixing.
We now consider convergence of (Tµn ) for measures on any solvable groups.
We have proved that solvable p-adic algebraic groups are identity excluding if
and only if it is of type R, here we prove that µn -averages of representations
on split solvable p-adic algebraic groups (which are not necessarily identity
excluding) are strongly convergent. We recall that a solvable p-adic algebraic
group is called split if maximal torus is splitting.

Theorem 5.1 Let G be a split solvable Zariski-connected p-adic algebraic
group which is not of type R. Let µ be an adapted and strictly aperiodic
probability measure on G. Let T be a representation of G. Then (Tµn ) con-
verges in the strong topology.

Proof In view of Theorem 2.2 of [LW], we may assume that T is irreducible.
Let U be the unipotent radical of G. Let A be a maximal of torus of G. Since
G is split, A is a split torus. Since G is not of type R, both U and A are
non-trivial. Then the center of U is non-trivial. Let Z be the center of U. We
may assume that T has an approximate fixed point, otherwise Tµn converges.
Then T is trivial on the center of G, so we may assume that G has trivial
center.
    Let Ẑ be the dual of Z. We now claim that the stabilizer of a non-trivial
point in Ẑ is a proper subgroup of G. Suppose there is a non-trivial point χ
in Ẑ whose stabilizer is the whole group. Then there exists a one-dimensional
subspace W of Z, which is a normal subgroup of G. Then W is either type
RG or W is contracted by an element of A. Suppose W is type RG . Then
since G is a split solvable group, G action on W is trivial. Since center of G
is trivial, this is a contradiction. So, we may assume that there is an element
g of A contracting W . Then χ(x) = g −n · χ(x) = χ(g n · x) → 1 for any x ∈ Z.

                                      10
This is a contradiction. Thus, the stabilizer of any non-trivial point of Ẑ is
a proper subgroup of G.
    By Mackey’s theorem (see 13.3, Theorem 1 of [Kr]), there exists a proper
subgroup H containing U and an irreducible representation ρ of H in a
Hilbert space E such that the induced representation of G from ρ is T (up
to equivalence).
    We now claim that G is a semidirect product of an abelian group and H.
Let A0 = A ∩ H. Then A0 is subtorus of A. Since A splits in G, there exists
a subtorus A1 of A such that A is the direct product A0 × A1 . Since A0 is a
proper split torus, A1 is a non-trivial split torus.
    Hence, we identify G/H with A1 . Let m be Haar measure on A1 . Then
under the identification, m is a G-invariant measure on G/H.
    Let L2 (G, H, ρ) be the space of all measurable functions f : G → E such
that
  (i) f (xh) = ρ(h)f (x) for all x ∈ G and h ∈ H,
      R
 (ii) A1 ||f (x)||2dm(x) < ∞.

Since the induced representation from ρ is T , T is defined on L2 (G, H, ρ) by
T (g)f (x) = f (gx) for all f ∈ L2 (G, H, ρ) and all x, g ∈ G (see Chapter I, 5.2
of [M]).
    Now for any g ∈ G, there exists unique s ∈ A1 and unique h ∈ H such
that g = sh. Thus, for f ∈ L2 (G, H, ρ), we have


    ||Tµ f ||2 R
       =       R| A1R <RTµ f (x), Tµ f (x) > dm(x)|
       ≤        RA1 RG RG | < f (g−1
                                   1 x), f (g2 x) > |dµ(g1 )dµ(g2 )dm(x)
       ≤         A1 G G
                          | < ρ(x h1 x)f (s1 x), ρ(x−1 h2 x)f (s2 x) > |dµdµdm
                where
                R R Rg1 = s1 h1 and g2 = s2 h2
       ≤         A1 G G
                          ||f (s1 x)||||f (s2x)||dµdµdm.

    Let λ be the image of µ in A1 under the canonical map g 7→ s and R be
the regular representation of A1 in L2 (A1 ). Then from the above calculations
we get that ||Tµn f || ≤ ||Rλn F || where F (x) = ||f (x)|| for all x ∈ A1 . Since
nilpotent groups are identity excluding and A1 is non-compact, we get that
||Tµn f || → 0.
   We now consider any split solvable group.

                                       11
Theorem 5.2 Let G be any split solvable Zariski-connected p-adic algebraic
group and µ be an adapted and strictly aperiodic probability measures on G.
Suppose T is a representation of G. Then (Tµn ) converges strongly.

Proof Suppose G is of type R. Then G is a nilpotent group and hence it
is identity excluding. Suppose G is not type R, then strong convergence of
(Tµn ) follows from Theorem 5.1
