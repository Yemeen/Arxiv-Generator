                                               The conventional integration theory on supermanifolds had been constructed so as to possess (an analog of)
                                             Stokes’ formula. In it, the exterior differential d is vital and the integrand is a section of a fiber bundle of finite
                                             rank. Other, not so popular, but, nevertheless, known integrations are analogs of Berezin integral associated
                                             with infinite dimensional fibers. Here I offer other unconventional integrations that appear thanks to existence of
                                             several versions of traces and determinants and do not allow Stokes formula. Such unconventional integrations
                                             have no counterpart on manifolds except in characteristic p.
                                               Another type of invariants considered are analogs of the cross ratio for “classical superspaces”.
                                               As a digression, homological fields corresponding to simple Lie algebras and superalgebras are described.
