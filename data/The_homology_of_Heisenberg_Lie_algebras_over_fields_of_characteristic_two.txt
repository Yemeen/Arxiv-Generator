                                                     Abstract. The generating function of the Betti numbers of the Heisenberg

                                                     theory.
                                               The Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension 2n + 1, denoted by hn , is the vector
                                            space with basis B = {z, x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . yn } where the only non-zero Lie products
                                            of basis elements are
                                                                             [xi , yi ] = −[yi , xi ] = z.
                                            In this paper the Betti numbers of the homology of hn over a field of characteristic
                                            2 is computed with the aid of algebraic discrete Morse theory from [Skö]. The
                                            notation from [Skö] will be freely used.

                                            algebra over a field of characteristic 2 is

                                               When the ground field of hn has characteristic 0, Santharoubane [San83] has
                                            shown that                                            

                                               Let us first recall the construction of the Chevalley–Eilenberg complex V of hn ,
                                            whose homology is the homology of hn : the complex V is given by
                                                              2n+1

                                                d(w                    (−1)i+j [wi , wj ] ∧ w1 ∧ · · · ∧ w
                                                                                                         ci ∧ · · · ∧ w
                                                                                                                      cj ∧ · · · ∧ wn

                                            for wi ∈ B.
                                               The p-th homology (with trivial coefficients) of hn , can now be obtained as the
                                            p-th homology group of the complex V.
                                               If I = {i1 , . . . , is } is a subset of [n], we will use the notation xI for the element
                                            xi1 ∧ · · · ∧ xis , (and similarly for yI ).
                                            Proof. The result is proved by constructing a Morse matching M on the digraph
                                            GV , and showing that when π is the projection coming from the splitting homotopy
                                            of M , we have that π(V) has trivial differential.

  The decomposition of the Chevalley–Eilenberg complex we will use is the obvious;
we consider the basis for V given by {z ∧ xI ∧ yJ , xI ∧ yJ | I, J ⊆ [n]}.
  Let the matching M consist of the following edges in GV :
                             xI ∧ yJ → z ∧ xI\{k} ∧ yJ\{k}
whenever max(I c ∩ J c ) < max(I ∩ J) and k = max(I ∩ J).
   There are now two kinds of unmatched elements: first the elements z ∧ xI ∧ yJ ,
with max(I c ∩J c ) < max(I ∩J), and then the elements xI ∧yJ , with max(I c ∩J c ) >
max(I ∩ J).
   When xI ∧ yJ ∈ M + , there is exactly one element z ∧ xI ′ ∧ yJ ′ with xI ∧ yJ →
z ∧ xI ′ ∧ yJ ′ that is not in M 0 , which implies that there can be no directed cycle in
the graph GM    V . Together with the fact that for all edges in GV the corresponding
component of the differential is an isomorphism, this implies that M is a Morse
matching.
   We will now see that the differential in π(V) is zero. For an element z ∧xI ∧yJ ∈
M 0 it is obvious that dπ(z ∧ xI ∧ yJ ) = πd(z ∧ xI ∧ yJ ) = 0. For xI ∧ yJ ∈ M 0 with
m = max(I c ∩ J c ) we get that
                                           X
                 π(xI ∧ yJ ) = xI ∧ yJ +       x(I\{i})∪{m} ∧ y(J\{i})∪{m} ,
                                         i∈I∩J

from which it is easily seen that dπ(xI ∧ yJ ) = 0. From [Skö, Theorem 1] now
follows that the i-th Betti number is equal to the number of unmatched vertices in
homological degree i.
   For the computation of the generating function we introduce the elements ui =
xi ∧yi , and we begin by counting the critical vertices z ∧xI ∧yJ ∧uK and xI ∧yJ ∧uK
when I ∪ J = L for a fixed set L ⊆ [n].
   If L = [n], the critical vertices are all z ∧ xI ∧ yJ and xI ∧ yJ and they contribute
with (1 + t)(2t)n toward the homology.
   If L 6= [n], then the critical vertices of the form z ∧ xI ∧ yJ ∧ uK are those
with max ([n] \ (I ∪ J)) ∈ K so they contribute with t3 (2t)|L| (1 + t2 )n−|L|−1 to-
ward the homology. The critical vertices of the form xI ∧ yJ ∧ uK are those with
max ([n] \ (I ∪ J)) 6∈ K and thus contribute with (2t)|L| (1 + t2 )n−|L|−1 toward the
homology.
   Summing up we get
                                             X
            f (t) = (1 + t)(2t)n + (1 + t3 )      (2t)|L| (1 + t2 )n−|L|−1
