                                                         We give a geometric construction of the Verma modules of a symmetric Kac-Moody Lie
                                                     algebra g in terms of constructible functions on the varieties of nilpotent finite-dimensional
                                                     modules of the corresponding preprojective algebra Λ.


                                             1       Introduction
                                             Let g be the symmetric Kac-Moody Lie algebra associated to a finite unoriented graph Γ without
                                             loop. Let n− denote a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of g. In [Lu1, §12], Lusztig has given a
                                             geometric construction of U (n− ) in terms of certain Lagrangian varieties. These varieties can be
                                             interpreted as module varieties for the preprojective algebra Λ attached to the graph Γ by Gelfand
                                             and Ponomarev [GP]. In Lusztig’s construction, U (n− ) gets identified with an algebra (M, ∗) of
                                             constructible functions on these varieties, where ∗ is a convolution product inspired by Ringel’s
                                             multiplication for Hall algebras.
                                                 Later, Nakajima gave a similar construction of the highest weight irreducible integrable g-
                                             modules L(λ) in terms of some new Lagrangian varieties which differ from Lusztig’s ones by the
                                             introduction of some extra vector spaces Wk for each vertex k of Γ, and by considering only stable
                                             points instead of the whole variety [Na, §10].
                                                 The aim of this paper is to extend Lusztig’s original construction and to endow M with the
                                             structure of a Verma module M (λ).
                                                 To do this we first give a variant of the geometrical construction of the integrable g-modules
                                             L(λ), using functions on some natural open subvarieties of Lusztig’s varieties instead of functions
                                             on Nakajima’s varieties (Theorem 1). These varieties have a simple description in terms of the
                                             preprojective algebra Λ and of certain injective Λ-modules qλ .
                                                 Having realized the integrable modules L(λ) as quotients of M, it is possible, using the co-
                                             multiplication of U (n− ), to construct geometrically the raising operators Eiλ ∈ End(M) which
                                             make M into the Verma module M (λ) (Theorem 2). Note that we manage in this way to realize
                                             Verma modules with arbitrary highest weight (not necessarily dominant).
                                                 Finally, we dualize this setting and give a geometric construction of the dual Verma module
                                             M (λ)∗ in terms of the delta functions δx ∈ M∗ attached to the finite-dimensional nilpotent Λ-
                                             modules x (Theorem 3).

2     Verma modules
2.1 Let g be the symmetric Kac-Moody Lie algebra associated with a finite unoriented graph Γ
without loop. The set of vertices of the graph is denoted by I. The (generalized) Cartan matrix of
g is A = (aij )i,j∈I , where aii = 2 and, for i 6= j, −aij is the number of edges between i and j.

2.2 Let g = n ⊕ h ⊕ n− be a Cartan decomposition of g, where h is a Cartan subalgebra and
(n, n− ) a pair of opposite maximal nilpotent subalgebras. Let b = n⊕h. The Chevalley generators
of n (resp. n− ) are denoted by ei (i ∈ I) (resp. fi ) and we set hi = [ei , fi ].

2.3 Let αi denote the simple root of g associated with i ∈ I. Let (− ; −) be a symmetric bilinear
form on h∗ such that (αi ; αj ) = aij . The lattice of integral weights in h∗ is denoted by P , and
the sublattice spanned by the simple roots is denoted by Q. We put

                   P+ = {λ ∈ P | (λ ; αi ) > 0, (i ∈ I)},          Q+ = Q ∩ P+ .

2.4   Let λ ∈ P and let M (λ) be the Verma module with highest weight λ. This is the induced
g-module defined by M (λ) = U (g) ⊗U (b) C uλ , where uλ is a basis of the one-dimensional
representation of b given by

                        h uλ = λ(h) uλ ,     n uλ = 0,        (h ∈ h, n ∈ n).

As a P -graded vector space M (λ) ∼
                                  = U (n− ) (up to a degree shift by λ). M (λ) has a unique simple
quotient denoted by L(λ), which is integrable if and only if λ ∈ P+ . In this case, the kernel of the
g-homomorphism M (λ) → L(λ) is the g-module I(λ) generated by the vectors
                                    (λ ; αi )+1
                                   fi             ⊗ uλ ,    (i ∈ I).


3     Constructible functions
3.1 Let X be an algebraic variety over C endowed with its Zariski topology. A map f from X
to a vector space V is said to be constructible if its image f (X) is finite, and for each v ∈ f (X)
the preimage f −1 (v) is a constructible subset of X.

3.2    By χ(A) we denote the Euler characteristic of a constructible subset A of X. For a con-
structible map f : X → V one defines
                            Z             X
                                  f (x) =      χ(f −1 (v)) v ∈ V.
                                 x∈X              v∈V

More generally, for a constructible subset A of X we write
                               Z             X
                                     f (x) =     χ(f −1 (v) ∩ A) v.
                                 x∈A              v∈V

4      Preprojective algebras
4.1    Let Λ be the preprojective algebra associated to the graph Γ (see for example [Ri, GLS]).
This is an associative C-algebra, which is finite-dimensional if and only if Γ is a graph of type
A, D, E. Let si denote the simple one-dimensional Λ-module associated with i ∈ I, and let pi be
its projective cover and qi its injective hull. Again, pi and qi are finite-dimensional if and only if
Γ is a graph of type A, D, E.

4.2    A finite-dimensional Λ-module x is nilpotent if and only if it has a composition series with
all factors of the form si (i ∈ I). We will identify the dimension vector of x with an element
β ∈ Q+ by setting dim(si ) = αi .

4.3     Let q be an injective Λ-module of the form
                                                M ⊕a
                                            q=     qi i
                                                 i∈I

for some nonnegative integers ai (i ∈ I).

Lemma 1 Let x be a finite-dimensional Λ-module isomorphic to a submodule of q. If f1 : x → q
and f2 : x → q are two monomorphisms, then there exists an automorphism g : q → q such that
f2 = gf1 .

                                                          L      ⊕ai
Proof — Indeed, q is the injective hull of its socle b =    i∈I si . Let cj (j = 1, 2) be a
complement of fj (socle(x)) in b. Then c1 ∼
                                          = c2 and the maps

                           hj := fj ⊕ id :    x ⊕ cj → q,        (j = 1, 2)

are injective hulls. The result then follows from the unicity of the injective hull.               ✷

      Hence, up to isomorphism, there is a unique way to embed x into q.

4.4 Let M be the algebra of constructible functions on the varieties of finite-dimensional nilpo-
tent Λ-modules defined by Lusztig [Lu2] to give a geometric realization of U (n− ). We recall its
definition. P
    For β = i∈I bi αi ∈ Q+ , let Λβ denote the variety of nilpotent Λ-modules withQ dimension
vector β. Recall that Λβ is endowed with an action of the algebraic group Gβ = i∈I GLbi (C),
so that two points of Λβ are isomorphic as Λ-modules if and only if they belong to the same Gβ -
           fβ denote the vector space of constructible functions from Λβ to C which are constant
orbit. Let M
on Gβ -orbits. Let                             M
                                       Mf=          Mfβ .
                                                 β∈Q+

                                  f as follows. For f ∈ M
One defines a multiplication ∗ on M                       fβ , g ∈ M
                                                                   fγ and x ∈ Λβ+γ , we have
                                               Z
                                  (f ∗ g)(x) =    f (x′ )g(x′′ ),                          (1)
                                                    U

where the integral is over the variety of x-stable subspaces U of x of dimension γ, x′′ is the Λ-
submodule of x obtained by restriction to U and x′ = x/x′′ . In the sequel in order to simplify

                                                  3
notation, we will not distinguish between the subspace U and the submodule x′′ of x carried by U .
Thus we shall rather write                     Z
                                 (f ∗ g)(x) =     f (x/x′′ )g(x′′ ),                          (2)
                                                 x′′
where the integral is over the variety of submodules x′′ of x of dimension γ.
    For i ∈ I, the variety Λαi is reduced to a single point : the simple module si . Denote by 1i the
function mapping this point to 1. Let G(i, x) denote the variety of all submodules y of x such that
x/y ∼= si . Then by (2) we have
                                                   Z
                                    (1i ∗ g)(x) =            g(y).                                (3)
                                                        y∈G(i,x)


  Let M denote the subalgebra of M  f generated by the functions 1i (i ∈ I). By Lusztig [Lu2],
(M, ∗) is isomorphic to U (n− ) by mapping 1i to the Chevalley generator fi .

4.5   In the identification of U (n− ) with M, formula (3) represents the left multiplication by fi .
In order to endow M with the structure of a Verma module we need to introduce the following
important definition. For ν ∈ P+ , let
                                              M ⊕(ν ; α )
                                                        i
                                         qν =     qi      .
                                              i∈I

Lusztig has shown [Lu3, §2.1] that Nakajima’s Lagrangian varieties for the geometric realization
of L(ν) are isomorphic to the Grassmann varieties of Λ-submodules of qν with a given dimension
vector.
    Let x be a finite-dimensional nilpotent Λ-module isomorphic to a submodule of the injective
module qν . Let us fix an embedding F : x → qν and identify x with a submodule of qν via F .

Definition 1 For i ∈ I let G(x, ν, i) be the variety of submodules y of qν containing x and such
that y/x is isomorphic to si .

    This is a projective variety which, by 4.3, depends only (up to isomorphism) on i, ν and the
isoclass of x.


5     Geometric realization of integrable irreducible g-modules
5.1   For λ ∈ P+ and β ∈ Q+ , let Λλβ denote the variety of nilpotent Λ-modules of dimension
vector β which are isomorphic to a submodule of qλ . Equivalently Λλβ consists of the nilpotent
modules of dimension vector β whose socle contains si with multiplicity at most (λ ; αi ) (i ∈ I).
This variety has been considered by Lusztig [Lu4, §1.5]. In particular it is known that Λλβ is an
open subset of Λβ , and that the number of its irreducible components is equal to the dimension of
the (λ − β)-weight space of L(λ).

5.2   Define Mfλ to be the vector space of constructible functions on Λλ which are constant on
                β                                                      β
Gβ -orbits. Let Mλβ denote the subspace of Mfλ obtained by restricting elements of Mβ to Λλ .
                                              β                                             β

5.3     The proof of Theorem 1 will involve a series of lemmas.

5.3.1 For i = (i1 , . . . , ir ) ∈ I r and a = (a1 , . . . , ar ) ∈ Nr , define the variety G(x, λ, (i, a)) of
flags of Λ-modules
                                   f = (x = y0 ⊂ y1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ yr ⊂ qλ )
with yk /yk−1 ∼   ⊕a
               = sik k (1 6 k 6 r). As in Definition 1, this is a projective variety depending (up to
isomorphism) only on (i, a), λ and the isoclass of x and not on the choice of a specific embedding
of x into qλ .
                fλ and x ∈ Λλ                                                  (a)
Lemma 2 Let f ∈ Mβ          β−a1 αi                   −···−ar αir .     Put Ei          = (1/a!)Eia . We have
                                                  1
                                                                   Z
                                (a )           (a )
                             (Eir r · · · Ei1 1 f )(x) =                                  f (yr ).
                                                                       f∈G(x,λ,(i,a))

The proof is standard and will be omitted.

5.3.2    By [Lu1, 12.11] the endomorphisms Fi satisfy the Serre relations
                                   1−aij
                                   X                    (p)        (1−aij −p)
                                            (−1)p Fj          Fi Fj                    =0
                                    p=0

for every i 6= j. A similar argument shows that
Lemma 3 The endomorphisms Ei satisfy the Serre relations
                                   1−aij
                                   X                    (p)            (1−aij −p)

                                   p=0

for every i 6= j.

                fλ and x ∈ Λλ
Proof — Let f ∈ Mβ          β−αi −(1−aij )αj . By Lemma 2,
                                                                               Z
                                   (p)   (1−a −p)
                                 (Ej Ei Ej ij f )(x)                       =           f (y3 )
                                                                                   f


                                                               5
the integral being taken on the variety of flags

                                    f = (x ⊂ y1 ⊂ y2 ⊂ y3 ⊂ qλ )
              ⊕1−aij −p
with y1 /x ∼
           = sj         , y2 /y1 ∼
                                 = si and y3 /y2 ∼
                                                     ⊕p
                                                  = sj . This integral can be rewritten as
                                       Z
                                           f (y3 ) χ(F[y3 ; p])
                                          y3

where the integral is now over all submodules y3 of qλ of dimension β containing x and F[y3 ; p] is
the variety of flags f as above with fixed last step y3 . Now, by moding out the submodule x at each
step of the flag, we are reduced to the same situation as in [Lu1, 12.11], and the same argument
allows to show that
                                        1−aij
                                         X
                                              χ(F[y3 ; p]) = 0,
                                         p=0

which proves the Lemma.                                                                            ✷


5.3.3 Let x ∈ Λλβ . Let εi (x) denote the multiplicity of si in the head of x. Let ϕi (x) denote the
multiplicity of si in the socle of qλ /x.

Lemma 4 Let i, j ∈ I (not necessarily distinct). Let y be a submodule of qλ containing x and
such that y/x ∼
              = sj . Then

                                ϕi (y) − εi (y) = ϕi (x) − εi (x) − aij .

Proof — We have short exact sequences

                                0 → x →            qλ      → qλ /x → 0,                           (7)
                                0 → y →          qλ        → qλ /y → 0,                           (8)
                                0 → x →            y       →   sj   → 0,                          (9)
                                0 → sj → qλ /x → qλ /y → 0.                                      (10)

Clearly, εi (x) = |HomΛ (x, si )|, the dimension of HomΛ (x, si ). Similarly εi (y) = |HomΛ (y, si )|,
ϕi (x) = |HomΛ (si , qλ /x)|, ϕi (y) = |HomΛ (si , qλ /y)|. Hence we have to show that

        |HomΛ (x, si )| − |HomΛ (y, si )| = |HomΛ (si , qλ /x)| − |HomΛ (si , qλ /y)| − aij .    (11)

In our proof, we will use a property of preprojective algebras proved in [CB, §1], namely, for any
finite-dimensional Λ-modules m and n there holds

                                    |Ext1Λ (m, n)| = |Ext1Λ (n, m)|.                             (12)

   (a) If i = j then aij = 2, |HomΛ (sj , si )| = 1 and |Ext1Λ (sj , si )| = 0 since Γ has no loops.
Applying HomΛ (−, si ) to (9) we get the exact sequence

                     0 → HomΛ (sj , si ) → HomΛ (y, si ) → HomΛ (x, si ) → 0,

hence
                                |HomΛ (x, si )| − |HomΛ (y, si )| = −1.

                                                       6
Similarly applying HomΛ (si , −) to (10) we get an exact sequence

                0 → HomΛ (si , sj ) → HomΛ (si , qλ /x) → HomΛ (si , qλ /y) → 0,

hence
                           |HomΛ (si , qλ /x)| − |HomΛ (si , qλ /y)| = 1,
and (11) follows.
   (b) If i 6= j, we have |HomΛ (si , sj )| = 0 and |Ext1Λ (si , sj )| = |Ext1Λ (sj , si )| = −aij .
Applying HomΛ (si , −) to (9) we get an exact sequence

                             0 → HomΛ (si , x) → HomΛ (si , y) → 0,

hence
                               |HomΛ (si , x)| − |HomΛ (si , y)| = 0.                             (13)
Moreover, by [Bo, §1.1], |Ext2Λ (si , sj )| = 0 because there are no relations from i to j in the
defining relations of Λ. (Note that the proof of this result in [Bo] only requires that I ⊆ J 2 (here
we use the notation of [Bo]). One does not need the additional assumption J n ⊆ I for some n.
Compare also the discussion in [BK].)
    Since qλ is injective |Ext1Λ (si , qλ )| = 0, thus applying HomΛ (si , −) to (7) we get an exact
sequence

         0 → HomΛ (si , x) → HomΛ (si , qλ ) → HomΛ (si , qλ /x) → Ext1Λ (si , x) → 0,

hence

           |HomΛ (si , x)| − |HomΛ (si , qλ )| + |HomΛ (si , qλ /x)| − |Ext1Λ (si , x)| = 0.      (14)

Similarly, applying HomΛ (si , −) to (8) we get

           |HomΛ (si , y)| − |HomΛ (si , qλ )| + |HomΛ (si , qλ /y)| − |Ext1Λ (si , y)| = 0.      (15)

Subtracting (14) from (15) and taking into account (12) and (13) we obtain

            |Ext1Λ (x, si )| − |Ext1Λ (y, si )| = |HomΛ (si , qλ /x)| − |HomΛ (si , qλ /y)|.      (16)

Now applying HomΛ (−, si ) to (9) we get the long exact sequence

    0 → HomΛ (y, si ) → HomΛ (x, si ) → Ext1Λ (sj , si ) → Ext1Λ (y, si ) → Ext1Λ (x, si ) → 0,

hence

           |HomΛ (y, si )| − |HomΛ (x, si )| − aij − |Ext1Λ (y, si )| + |Ext1Λ (x, si )| = 0,

thus, taking into account (16), we have proved (11).                                               ✷


Lemma 5 With the same notation we have

                                   ϕi (x) − εi (x) = (λ − β; αi ).




                                                   7
Proof — We use an induction on the height of β. If β = 0 then x is the zero module and εi (x) = 0.
On the other hand qλ /x = qλ and ϕi (x) = (λ; αi ) by definition of qλ . Now assume that the lemma
holds for x ∈ Λλβ and let y ∈ Λλβ+αj be a submodule of qλ containing x. Using Lemma 4 we get
that
                     ϕi (y) − εi (y) = (λ − β; αi ) − aij = (λ − β − αj ; αi ),
as required, and the lemma follows.                                                                ✷


                fλ . We have
Lemma 6 Let f ∈ Mβ

                               (Ei Fj − Fj Ei )(f ) = δij (λ − β; αi )f.

Proof — Let x ∈ Λλβ−αi +αj . By definition of Ei and Fj we have
                                                         Z
                                       (Ei Fj f )(x) =             f (y)
                                                          p∈P

where P denotes the variety of pairs p = (u, y) of submodules of qλ with x ⊂ u, y ⊂ u, u/x ∼
                                                                                           = si
and u/y ∼
        = sj . Similarly,                           Z
                                       (Fj Ei f )(x) =             f (y)
                                                             q∈Q

where Q denotes the variety of pairs q = (v, y) of submodules of qλ with v ⊂ x, v ⊂ y, x/v ∼    = sj
and y/v ∼= si .
    Consider a submodule y such that there exists in P (resp. in Q) at least one pair of the form
(u, y) (resp. (v, y)). Clearly, the subspaces carrying the submodules x and y have the same di-
mension d and their intersection has dimension at least d − 1. If this intersection has dimension
exactly d − 1 then there is a unique pair (u, y) (resp. (v, y)), namely (x + y, y) (resp. (x ∩ y, y)).
This means that                  Z                  Z
                                           f (y) =              f (y).
                                  p∈P; y6=x              q∈Q; y6=x

In particular, since when i 6= j we cannot have y = x, it follows that

                               (Ei Fj − Fj Ei )(f ) = 0,             (i 6= j).

On the other hand if i = j we have

                         ((Ei Fi − Fi Ei )(f ))(x) = f (x)(χ(P′ ) − χ(Q′ ))

where P′ is the variety of submodules u of qλ containing x such that u/x ∼
                                                                         = si , and Q′ is the
                                           ∼
variety of submodules v of x such that x/v = si . Clearly we have χ(Q ) = εi (x) and χ(P′ ) =
                                                                     ′

ϕi (x). The result then follows from Lemma 5.                                              ✷


5.3.4                                                                 fλ are easily checked
        The following relations for the endomorphisms Ei , Fi , Hi of M

                     [Hi , Hj ] = 0,    [Hi , Ej ] = aij Ej ,      [Hi , Fj ] = −aij Fj .

The verification is left to the reader. Hence, using Lemmas 3 and 6, we have proved that the
                                                                           fλ .
assignments ei 7→ Ei , fi 7→ Fi , hi 7→ Hi , give a representation of g on M

                                                     8
Lemma 7 The endomorphisms Ei , Fi , Hi leave stable the subspace Mλ .

Proof — It is obvious for Hi , and it follows from the definition of Mλ for Fi . It remains to
prove that if f ∈ Mλβ then Ei f ∈ Mλβ−αi . We shall use induction on the height of β. We can
assume that f is of the form Fj g for some g ∈ Mλβ−αj . By induction we can also assume that
Ei g ∈ Mλβ−αi −αj . We have
                          Ei f = Ei Fj g = Fj Ei g + δij (λ − β + αj ; αi )g,
and the right-hand side clearly belongs to Mλβ−αi .                                                ✷

Lemma 8 The representation of g carried by Mλ is isomorphic to L(λ).
                                                                        ∗(a +1)
Proof — For all f ∈ Mβ and all x ∈ Λλβ+(ai +1)αi we have f ∗ 1i i (x) = 0. Indeed, by
definition of Λλ the socle of x contains si with multiplicity at most ai . Therefore the left ideal of
                                  ∗(a +1)
M generated by the functions 1i i         is mapped to zero by the linear map M → Mλ sending a
function f on Λβ to its restriction to Λλβ . It follows that for all β the dimension of Mλβ is at most
the dimension of the (λ − β)-weight space of L(λ).
    On the other hand, the function 10 mapping the zero Λ-module to 1 is a highest weight vector
of Mλ of weight λ. Hence 10 ∈ Mλ generates a quotient of the Verma module M (λ), and since
L(λ) is the smallest quotient of M (λ) we must have Mλ = L(λ).                                     ✷
      This finishes the proof of Theorem 1.


6      Geometric realization of Verma modules
                                              L        ⊕ai
6.1  Let β ∈ Q+ and x ∈ Λβ−αi . Let q =           i∈I qi   be the injective hull of x. For every
ν ∈ P+ such that (ν; αi ) > ai the injective module qν contains a submodule isomorphic to x.
Hence, for such a weight ν and for any f ∈ Mβ , the integral
                                        Z
                                                   f (y)
                                              y∈G(x,ν,i)
is well-defined.
Proposition 1 Let λ ∈ P and choose ν ∈ P+ such that (ν; αi ) > ai for all i ∈ I. The number
                         Z
                                   f (y) − (ν − λ ; αi ) f (x ⊕ si )                      (17)
                               y∈G(x,ν,i)

does not depend on the choice of ν. Denote this number by (Eiλ f )(x). Then, the function
                                        Eiλ f : x 7→ (Eiλ f )(x)
belongs to Mβ−αi .
   Denote by Eiλ the endomorphism of M mapping f ∈ Mβ to Eiλ f . Notice that Formula (5),
which is nothing but (3), also defines an endomorphism of M independent of λ which we again
denote by Fi . Finally Formula (6) makes sense for any λ, not necessarily dominant, and any
f ∈ Mβ . This gives an endomorphism of M that we shall denote by Hiλ .
Theorem 2 The assignments ei 7→ Eiλ , fi 7→ Fi , hi 7→ Hiλ , give a representation of g on M
isomorphic to the Verma module M (λ).
      The rest of this section is devoted to the proofs of Proposition 1 and Theorem 2.

                                                    9
6.2    Denote by eλi the endomorphism of the Verma module M (λ) implementing the action of
the Chevalley generator ei . Let Eiλ denote the endomorphism of U (n− ) obtained by transporting
eλi via the natural identification M (λ) ∼
                                         = U (n− ). Let ∆ be the comultiplication of U (n− ).

Lemma 9 For λ, µ ∈ P and u ∈ U (n− ) we have

                                        ∆(Eiλ+µ u) = (Eiλ ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ Eiµ )∆u.

Proof — By linearity it is enough to prove this for u of the form u = fi1 · · · fir . A simple
calculation in U (g) shows that
                                                               r
                                                               X
                       ei fi1 · · · fir = fi1 · · · fir ei +         δiik fi1 · · · fik−1 hi fik+1 · · · fir
                                                               k=1

                       r                                                          r
                                                                                                 !                                     !
                       X                                                          X
= fi1 · · · fir ei +         δiik   fi1 · · · fik−1 fik+1 · · · fir hi −                  aiis       fi1 · · · fik−1 fik+1 · · · fir       .
                       k=1                                                    s=k+1

It follows that, for ν ∈ P ,
                                        r                           r
                                                                                  !
                                        X                           X
             Eiν (fi1   · · · fir ) =         δiik   (ν; αi ) −            aiis       fi1 · · · fik−1 fik+1 · · · fir .
                                        k=1                       s=k+1

Now, using that ∆ is the algebra homomorphism defined by ∆(fi ) = fi ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ fi , one can
finish the proof of the lemma. Details are omitted.                                      ✷


6.3    We endow U (n− ) with the Q+ -grading given by deg(fi ) = αi . Let u be a homogeneous
element of U (n− ). Write ∆u = u ⊗ 1 + u(i) ⊗ fi + A, where A is a sum of homogeneous terms
of the form u′ ⊗ u′′ with deg(u′′ ) 6= αi . This defines u(i) unambiguously.

Lemma 10 For λ, µ ∈ P we have

                                               Eiλ+µ u = Eiλ u + (µ; αi ) u(i) .

Proof — We calculate in two ways the unique term of the form E ⊗ 1 in ∆(Eiλ+µ u). On the one
hand, we have obviously E ⊗ 1 = Eiλ+µ u ⊗ 1. On the other hand, using Lemma 9, we have

               E ⊗ 1 = Eiλ u ⊗ 1 + (1 ⊗ Eiµ )(u(i) ⊗ fi ) = Eiλ u ⊗ 1 + (µ; αi ) u(i) ⊗ 1.

Therefore,
                                         E = Eiλ+µ u = Eiλ u + (µ; αi ) u(i) .
                                                                                                                                       ✷




                                                               10
6.4  Now let us return to the geometric realization M of U (n− ). Let Eiλ denote the endomor-
phism of M obtained by transporting eλi via the identification M (λ) ∼
                                                                     = M.
Lemma 11 Let λ ∈ P+ , f ∈ Mβ and x ∈ Λλβ−αi . Then
                                         Z
                               λ
                            (Ei f )(x) =           f (y).
                                                         y∈G(x,λ,i)


Proof — Let rλ : M → Mλ be the linear map sending f ∈ Mβ to its restriction to Λλβ .
By Theorem 1, this is a homomorphism of U (n− )-modules mapping the highest weight vector
of M ∼  = M (λ) to the highest weight vector of Mλ ∼ = L(λ). It follows that rλ is in fact a
homomorphism of U (g)-modules, hence the restriction of Eiλ f to Λλβ−αi is given by Formula (4)
of Section 5.                                                                               ✷

      Let again λ ∈ P be arbitrary, and pick f ∈ Mβ . It follows from Lemma 10 that for any µ ∈ P
                                       Eiλ+µ f − (µ; αi ) f (i) = Eiλ f.
Let x ∈ Λβ−αi . Choose ν = λ + µ sufficiently dominant so that x is isomorphic to a submodule
of qν . Then by Lemma 11, we have
                                             Z
                                  ν
                                (Ei f )(x) =           f (y).
                                                         y∈G(x,ν,i)

On the other hand, by the geometric description of ∆ given in [GLS, §6.1], if we write
                                       ∆f = f ⊗ 1 + f (i) ⊗ 1i + A
where A is a sum of homogeneous terms of the form f ′ ⊗ f ′′ with deg(f ′′ ) 6= αi , we have that
f (i) is the function on Λβ−αi given by f (i) (x) = f (x ⊕ si ). Hence we obtain that for x ∈ Λβ−αi
                                    Z
                          λ
                       (Ei f )(x) =             f (y) − (ν − λ; αi )f (x ⊕ si ).
                                         y∈G(x,ν,i)

This proves both Proposition 1 and Theorem 2.                                                   ✷


6.5     Let λ ∈ P+ . We note the following consequence of Lemma 11.
Proposition 2 Let λ ∈ P+ . The linear map rλ : M → Mλ sending f ∈ Mβ to its restriction to
Λλβ is the geometric realization of the homomorphism of g-modules M (λ) → L(λ).        ✷


7      Dual Verma modules
7.1     Let S be the anti-automorphism of U (g) defined by
                       S(ei ) = fi ,     S(fi ) = ei ,     S(hi ) = hi ,   (i ∈ I).
Recall that, given a left U (g)-module M , the dual module M ∗ is defined by
                   (u ϕ)(m) = ϕ(S(u) m),                 (u ∈ U (g), m ∈ M, ϕ ∈ M ∗ ).
This is also a left module. If M is an infinite-dimensional
                                                     L      module with finite-dimensional weight
spaces Mν , we take for M the graded dual M = ν∈P Mν∗ .
                            ∗                    ∗

    For λ ∈ P we have L(λ)∗ ∼    = L(λ), hence the quotient map M (λ) → L(λ) gives by duality
                               ∗
an embedding L(λ) → M (λ) of U (g)-modules.

                                                      11
                  L
7.2   Let M∗ = β∈Q+ M∗β denote the vector space graded dual of M. For x ∈ Λβ , we denote
by δx the delta function given by

                                       δx (f ) = f (x),          (f ∈ Mβ ).

Note that the map δ : x 7→ δx is a constructible map from Λβ to M∗β . Indeed the preimage of δx
is the intersection of the constructible subsets

 M(i1 ,...,ir ) = {y ∈ Λβ | (1i1 ∗ · · · ∗ 1ir )(y) = (1i1 ∗ · · · ∗ 1ir )(x)},        (αi1 + · · · + αir = β).

7.3   We can now dualize the results of Sections 5 and 6 as follows. For λ ∈ P and x ∈ Λβ put
                                      Z
                        ∗
                     (Ei )(δx ) =               δy ,                                       (18)
                                                 y∈G(i,x)
                                             Z
                        (Fiλ∗ )(δx )     =                    δy − (ν − λ ; αi ) δx⊕si ,                    (19)
                                                 y∈G(x,ν,i)


                        (Hiλ∗ )(δx ) = (λ − β; αi ) δx ,                                                    (20)

where in (19) the weight ν ∈ P+ is such that x is isomorphic to a submodule of qν . The following
theorem then follows immediately from Theorems 1 and 2.

Theorem 3 (i) The formulas above define endomorphisms Ei∗ , Fiλ∗ , Hiλ∗ of M∗ , and the assign-
ments ei 7→ Ei∗ , fi 7→ Fiλ∗ , hi 7→ Hiλ∗ , give a representation of g on M∗ isomorphic to the dual
Verma module M (λ)∗ .
   (ii) If λ ∈ P+ , the subspace Mλ∗ of M∗ spanned by the delta functions δx of the finite-
dimensional nilpotent submodules x of qλ carries the irreducible submodule L(λ). For such a
module x, Formula (19) simplifies as follows
                                                    Z
                                     (Fiλ∗ )(δx ) =            δy .
                                                              y∈G(x,λ,i)

                                                                                                             ✷


Example 1 Let g be of type A2 . Take λ = ̟1 + ̟2 , where ̟i is the fundamental weight
corresponding to i ∈ I. Thus L(λ) is isomorphic to the 8-dimensional adjoint representation of
g = sl3 .
    A Λ-module x consists of a pair of linear maps x21 : V1 → V2 and x12 : V2 → V1 such that
x12 x21 = x21 x12 = 0. The injective Λ-module q = qλ has the following form :
                                                      
                                             u1 −→ u2
                                       q=
                                              v1 ←− v2

This diagram means that (u1 , v1 ) is a basis of V1 , that (u2 , v2 ) is a basis of V2 , and that

                   q21 (u1 ) = u2 ,     q21 (v1 ) = 0,        q12 (v2 ) = v1 ,   q12 (u2 ) = 0.

Using the same type of notation, we can exhibit the following submodules of q :
                                                                            
  x1 = v1 , x2 = u2 , x3 = v1               u2 , x4 = u1 −→ u2 , x5 = v1 ←− v2 ,

                                                         12
                                                                                     
                                           u1 −→ u2                                  u2
                               x6 =                   ,            x7 =                   .
                                           v1                                  v1 ←− v2
                                                                           
This is not an exhaustive list. For example, x′4 = (u1 + v1 ) −→ u2 is another submodule,
isomorphic to x4 . Denoting by 0 the zero submodule, we see that δ0 is the highest weight vector of
L(λ) ⊂ M (λ)∗ . Next, writing for simplicity δi instead of δxi and Fi instead of Fiλ , Theorem 3 (ii)
gives the following formulas for the action of the Fi ’s on L(λ).

                    F1 δ0 = δ1 ,       F2 δ0 = δ2 ,       F1 δ2 = δ3 + δ4 ,         F2 δ1 = δ3 + δ5 ,

        F1 δ3 = F1 δ4 = δ6 ,        F2 δ3 = F2 δ5 = δ7 ,          F2 δ3 = F1 δ6 = δq ,          F1 δq = F2 δq = 0.
Now consider the Λ-module x = s1 ⊕ s1 . Since x is not isomorphic to a submodule of qλ , the
vector δx does not belong to L(λ). Let us calculate Fi δx (i = 1, 2) by means of Formula (19). We
can take ν = 2̟1 . The injective Λ-module qν has the following form :
                                                          
                                              w1 ←− w2
                                      qν =
                                               v1 ←− v2

It is easy to see that the variety G(x, ν, 2) is isomorphic to a projective line P1 , and that all points
on this line are isomorphic to                             
                                                   w1
                                           y=
                                                   v1 ←− v2
as Λ-modules. Hence,

                        F2 δx = χ(P1 ) δy − (ν − λ; α2 ) δx⊕s2 = 2 δy + δs1 ⊕s1 ⊕s2 .

On the other hand, G(x, ν, 1) = ∅, so that

                                  F1 δx = −(ν − λ; α1 ) δx⊕s1 = −δs1 ⊕s1 ⊕s1 .
