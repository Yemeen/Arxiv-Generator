                                                  Abstract. If G is a (connected) complex Lie Group and Z is a generalized flag
                                                  manifold for G, then the open orbits D of a (connected) real form G0 of G form
                                                  an interesting class of complex homogeneous spaces, which play an important role
                                                  in the representation theory of G0 . We find that the group of automorphisms, i.e.,
                                                  the holomorphic diffeomorphisms, is a finite-dimensional Lie group, except for a small
                                                  number of open orbits, where it is infinite dimensional. In the finite-dimensional case,
                                                  we determine its structure. Our results have some consequences in representation
                                                  theory.




                                             §1. We determine the automorphism groups for a certain interesting class of com-
                                             plex homogeneous spaces. Denote by Z a generalized flag manifold for a connected
                                             complex semisimple Lie group G. A real form G0 (which we assume to be con-
                                             nected) of G acts on Z with a finite number of orbits, thus there are always open
                                             orbits (cf. [22]). These open orbits play a key role in the representation theory of
                                             G0 . An open G0 -orbit D in Z has a G0 -invariant complex structure. The identity
                                             component of the group of holomorphic diffeomorphisms of D will be denoted by
                                             Hol (D). In the main theorem below we determine Hol (D) for each measurable
                                             open orbit (see Definition 2.1). In the case where D is measurable, D carries a
                                             G0 -invariant (usually) indefinite hermitian metric and we determine its group of
                                             hermitian isometries. Generally the open orbits D are non-compact, however, our
                                             results include the cases where G0 is a compact real form and D is compact, so
                                             D = Z. The compact case is contained in [12], [21], [3] and [2], from various points
                                             of view.
                                                In general, for a complex manifold X, Hol (X) is a (finite-dimensional) Lie group
                                             if X is compact and may or may not be a Lie group if X is non-compact. For
                                             example, Hol (Cn ) is infinite dimensional. Our main interest is when G0 (so D) is
                                             non-compact. We give a precise condition for Hol (D) to be a Lie group.

    Our main results are contained in the following theorem.

Main Theorem. Suppose G is a connected simple complex Lie group and D is an
open measurable G0 -orbit in a generalized complex flag manifold for G.
   (1) If there is a G0 -equivariant holomorphic fibration of D over the hermitian
       symmetric space for G0 (and D is not equal to the hermitian symmetric
       space itself), then Hol (D) is not a finite-dimensional Lie group.
   (2) If no such fibration exists, then Hol (D) is a Lie group and, except for the
       cases listed in Table 1.1 below, we have:
          (a) Hol (D) = G0 if G0 is non-compact and,
          (b) Hol (D) = G if G0 is compact.

                               D is any open orbit in Z.

    (3) The group of hermitian isometries (i.e., the group of holomorphic diffeomor-
        phisms preserving the hermitian metric) is
          (a) Hol (D) if G0 is non-compact and,
          (b) a compact real form of Hol (D) if G0 is compact.

   In Proposition 3.11 we will see how the case of a semisimple group reduces to
the case of simple groups.
   The method of proof is to study the Lie algebra of global holomorphic vector fields
on D using some standard techniques from representation theory. In most cases,
this Lie algebra is just g. However, in other cases, it is a bigger finite-dimensional
Lie algebra g1 . In each of these cases we find a group G10 which has (complexified)
Lie algebra g1 and has an effective action on D.
   Our results have several consequences for the representations associated to the
open orbits. In the cases listed in Table 1.1 we view G10 as acting on D. The
irreducible representations occurring in Dolbeault cohomology spaces on D extend
     THE AUTOMORPHISM GROUPS OF COMPLEX HOMOGENEOUS SPACES                          3

to (irreducible) representations of G10 . Also, the results have implications for a
space of maximal compact subvarieties of D, which in turn plays a role in certain
realizations of these representations. This will be discussed in the final section.
   We are grateful to T.N. Bailey for helpful discussions regarding Proposition 2.3.
and especially to D.A. Vogan for suggesting the approach to Propositions 2.4 and
2.5.

§2. Some detailed information is obtained on the Lie algebra of global holomorphic
vector fields on D. It will follow that Hol (D) is usually finite dimensional and its
structure will be narrowed down to a few possibilities. We start with some notation.
   Let G be a connected simple complex Lie group. As mentioned in the intro-
duction, the semisimple case can be reduced to the simple case. Fix a generalized
complex flag manifold Z for G. Then, Z is (biholomorphic to) G/Q where Q is
a parabolic subgroup of G. We follow the common practice of denoting the Lie
algebra of a Lie group by the corresponding gothic letter. Thus, the Lie algebras
of G and Q will be denoted by g and q, respectively. A connected real form of G
will be denoted by G0 , with Lie algebra g0 . By Theorem 2.6 of [22], G0 acts on Z
with a finite number of orbits. Hence we know that open orbits always exist. Fix a
Cartan involution θ and let K (respectively, K0 ) denote the fixed-point group of θ
in G (respectively, G0 ). Fix an arbitrary open orbit D in Z. For z0 ∈ D, StabG (z0 )
is a parabolic subgroup Q. The Levi decompositions are given by Q = LU and
q = l + u. By Theorem 4.5 of [22] we may choose z0 so that q contains a Cartan
subalgebra h of g, so that t = h ∩ k is a Cartan subalgebra of k.

Definition 2.1. The orbit D is measurable if and only if D carries a G0 -invariant
measure.

   By Theorem 6.3 of [22], D is measurable if and only if q ∩ q = l. This is
equivalent to the statement that StabG0 (z0 ) = L0 , a real form of L. We describe
this in terms of the Lie algebras as follows. Let ∆ = ∆(h, g) be the roots of h
in g. Then, there exists λ0 ∈ it∗0 such that ∆(h, l) = {α ∈ ∆ | hλ0 , αi = 0} and
∆(h, u) = {α ∈ ∆ | hλ0 , αi < 0}. Also, u is the complex conjugate (with respect to
the real form g0 ) of a subalgebra u and q = l + u is the parabolic opposite to q. We
assume from now on that D is a measurable open G0 -orbit in Z.

Remark. It is the measurable open orbits that play an important role in represen-
tation theory. If G0 contains a compact Cartan subgroup or if Z is the full flag
manifold (so Q is a Borel subgroup), then all open orbits are measurable. Also, if
one open G0 -orbit in Z is measurable, then all open orbits are measurable. A simple
example of a non-measurable open orbit is the (unique) open orbit of SL(3, R) on
CP2 .

  The hermitian symmetric spaces G0 /K0 are examples of measurable open orbits.
4                     EDWARD G. DUNNE AND ROGER ZIERAU

In this case, writing the Cartan decomposition as g = k ⊕ p, p splits into p+ ⊕ p−
as representations of K. One sees that G0 /K0 is an open orbit in G/KP− . It is
well known that G0 /K0 is biholomorphic to a bounded domain in some CN . Thus
the Lie algebra of global holomorphic vector fields is infinite dimensional, so our
arguments in this case are a little different from the general case. We will treat this
case first.

Proposition 2.2. If B = G0 /K0 is a hermitian symmetric space, then Hol (B) is
finite-dimensional.

Proof. This is standard. It is contained in Chapter VIII of [7].

    We now give a condition for Hol (D) to be infinite dimensional.

Proposition 2.3. If B = G0 /K0 is of hermitian symmetric type and D is an
open orbit with p− $ u then the natural fibration π : D → B is holomorphically
trivial, in particular D ∼
                         = B × K0 · z0 . Furthermore, the group of holomorphic
diffeomorphisms of D is not a finite-dimensional Lie group.

Proof. Recall the following decomposition of G0 . In the complex group G, P+ KP−
is a dense open set and G0 ⊂ P+ KP− . Furthermore, the decomposition of g ∈ G0
as g = p+ kp− is unique. Then the Harish-Chandra embedding maps gK0 ∈ B to
ξ ∈ p+ , where p+ = exp(ξ). Denote the image of the Harish-Chandra embedding
by B. Then B is a bounded domain biholomorphic to B = G0 /K0 .
   Now suppose that D has p− ⊂ u. Then L0 ⊂ K0 and LU ⊂ KP− . It is clear
that D = G0 · z0 ⊂ P+ K · z0 . The latter is biholomorphic to p+ × K0 /(K0 ∩ L0 ).
To see this, note that the map Φ : p+ × K0 /(K0 ∩ L0 ) → P+ K · z0 given by
Φ(ξ+ , k) = exp(ξ+ )k · z0 is complex analytic. It is clearly onto. It is one-to-
one: if exp(ξ)k · z0 = exp(ξ ′ )k ′ · z0 , then by the uniqueness of the Harish-Chandra
decomposition, exp(ξ) = exp(ξ ′ ); so ξ = ξ ′ . Then k · z0 = k ′ · z0 . We must
determine the inverse image of D under Φ. Note that elements of G0 can be written
as g = exp(ξ)kp− with ξ ∈ B. Thus, g · z0 = exp(ξ)k · z0 . As Φ is bijective,
Φ−1 (D) = B × K · z0 . But K · z0 = K0 · z0 ∼      = K0 /(K0 ∩ L0 ). This proves the first
part of the proposition.
   As B is a bounded domain in some CN , the space of holomorphic functions
f : B → k is infinite dimensional. Now, K · z0 = K0 · z0 , so K is contained in the
automorphism group of K0 · z0 . Thus, for each holomorphic f : B → k, there is an
automorphism of B × K0 · z0 defined by ϕ(ξ, z) = (ξ, (exp(f (ξ)))z). Note that k 6= 0
since p− 6= u. This provides an infinite-dimensional family in Hol (D). 

   Proposition 2.3 is (1) of the main theorem, since there exists a holomorphic
fibration D → B as in (1) if and only if u properly contains p+ or p− . Also note
that B is simply connected, whence D → B cannot have discrete fibers.

   Assume from now on that u does not contain p− or p+ . In these cases, as we
will see, Hol (D) is a (finite-dimensional) Lie group. Now consider the Lie algebra
of holomorphic vector fields on D, that is, the global sections H 0 (D, T ) of the vec-
tor bundle T of holomorphic vector fields on D. Note that T is the holomorphic
homogeneous vector bundle for the representation g/q of Q. Since G0 acts on D
and on T , it is clear that H 0 (D, T ) is a representation of G0 . There is considerable
machinery available to study representations of this type. See, for example, [17]
and [25]. We will very briefly describe the ingredients that we will need. For any
finite-dimensional representation F of Q, let F → Z be the corresponding holomor-
phic, homogeneous vector bundle on Z. By restriction, we obtain a homogeneous
vector bundle on D denoted by F → D. By [25], the Dolbeault cohomology spaces
H p (D, F ) are continuous, admissible representations of G0 . The Harish-Chandra
module (i.e., the subspace of K0 -finite vectors in H p (D, F ) ) is a cohomologically
parabolically induced (g, K0 )-module Rpq (F ). The definition of Rpq (F ) is given in
Definition 1, page 432 of [25] (and in §6.3 of [16], with slightly different conven-
tions). It follows immediately that R0q (F ) ⊂ Homq (U(g), F )K0 −finite . Here, U(g)
is the universal enveloping algebra of g and the subscript ‘K0 -finite’ indicates the
subspace of K0 -finite vectors.

Proposition 2.4. If E is a finite-dimensional representation of G0 , then
                 HomG0 (E, H 0 (D, T )) 6= 0 =⇒ Homq (E, g/q) 6= 0.

Proof. If φ : E → H 0 (D, T ) is a nonzero G0 -homomorphism, then the image of
φ lies in H 0 (D, T ). But H 0 (D, T ) ⊂ Homq (U(g), g/q). So φ defines a nonzero
element of Homg (E, Homq (U(g), g/q)) ∼ = Homq (E, g/q).

Proposition 2.5. H 0 (D, T ) is finite dimensional and Hol (D) is a Lie group unless
G0 /K0 is hermitian symmetric and p+ ⊂ u or p− ⊂ u.

Proof. Fix a positive root system ∆+ ⊂ ∆ so that ∆(u) ⊂ ∆+ . (We may choose
∆+ = ∆+ l ∪ ∆(u) with ∆+ (l) an arbitrary positive system for ∆(l).) Suppose
F is a finite dimensional Q = LU representation with trivial U action. Then,
viewing F as a Q = LU representation with trivial U action, by Lemma 5.15 of
[17], Homq (U(g), F )L0 ∩K0 -finite ∼
                                    = U(g) ⊗q F . Furthermore, (U(g) ⊗q F )K0 −finite is a
highest-weight Harish-Chandra module (with respect to ∆+ ). By a result of Harish-
Chandra (cf. [5], Theorem 1 and Corollary 2, page 761), the only case for which
there exist infinite-dimensional highest-weight (g, K)-modules is when ∆+ contains
∆(p+ ) or ∆(p− ).
    Now consider the holomorphic tangent bundle T . The action of U on g/q is
not in general trivial, so the above does not apply directly. Instead, we form a
filtration g/q = F1 ⊃ F2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ FN ⊃ 0 so that Fi /Fi+1 does have a triv-
ial u action. (For instance, we could take a composition series for g/q, so that
6                     EDWARD G. DUNNE AND ROGER ZIERAU

each Fi /Fi+1 is irreducible as q-module, in which case the action of u is nec-
essarily trivial.) As Homq (U(g), · )(L0 ∩K0 )-finite is exact, there is a filtration of
Homq (U(g), g/q)(L0 ∩K0 )-finite with quotients Homq (U(g), (Fi /Fi+1 ))(L0 ∩K0 )-finite ∼
                                                                                         =
(U(g) ⊗q (Fi /Fi+1 )). Now we may conclude that, unless ∆+ contains one of ∆(p± ),
Homq (U(g), g/q)K0 -finite is finite dimensional.
    Now note that as we were free to choose ∆+ (l) ⊂ ∆, it follows that ∆(p± )∩∆(l) =
0. Thus, ∆+ contains one of ∆(p± ) if and only if ∆(u) contains one of ∆(p± ), that
is, if and only if p+ ⊂ u or p− ⊂ u.
    That Hol (D) is a Lie group now follows from Theorem 3.1 of [9]. 

  By Proposition 2.5 we may use Proposition 2.4 to restrict the possibilities for
Hol (D). Note, it is clear that

(2.6)                                Homq (E, g/q)

is non-zero for E = g and, of course, that G0 ⊂ Hol (D).

Corollary 2.7. If (2.6) is zero for all irreducible representations E ∼
                                                                      6 g, then
                                                                       =
Hol (D) = G0 or G.

Proof. The Lie algebra of Hol (D) lies between g0 and g. As g is simple the only
possibilities for Hol (D) are G0 and G. 

   We look for finite-dimensional representations E other than E ∼
                                                                 = g such that (2.6)
is non-zero. We start off with a fact about the structure of simple Lie algebras.

Lemma 2.8. If g is a simple Lie algebra, then the Weyl group is transitive on roots
of a given length. Therefore, there are two possibilities:
    (1) There is just one root length and the highest root, which we denote by γℓ ,
        is the unique ∆+ -dominant root.
    (2) There are two root lengths and there is a unique dominant long root γℓ and
        a unique dominant short root γs .

Proof. This is standard. See, for example, [8], page 53.

Theorem 2.9. If g is simple and has just one root length and u does not contain
p+ or p− , then
                               G0 , if G0 is non-compact
                             
                  Hol (D) =
                               G, if G0 is compact.

Proof. Suppose E is an irreducible finite-dimensional representation of G0 . Then,
by Corollary 2.7, it is enough to check that (2.6) is zero unless E ∼ = g. Since ∆+
contains ∆(u), the highest-weight space in E is cyclic for q = l + u. So, a nonzero q
     THE AUTOMORPHISM GROUPS OF COMPLEX HOMOGENEOUS SPACES                          7

homomorphism φ : E → g/q maps the highest-weight vector to a (nonzero) weight
vector in g/q (of the same weight). This weight must be dominant. As there is just
one root length, Lemma 2.8 says that this highest weight of E must be γℓ . Now
Corollary 2.7 applies.
 In case G0 is non-compact, D 6= Z and G does not act on D. Thus, Hol (D) = G0 .
When G0 is compact, D = Z and G always acts on D. 

   When there are two root lengths in g, then by Lemma 2.8 we have the possibility
that the Lie algebra of holomorphic vector fields is g or g ⊕ Eγs , where Eγs is
the irreducible finite-dimensional representation of g with highest weight γs . In
connection with this case we have the following lemma.

Lemma 2.10. Let g be a simple Lie algebra with two root lengths. Then there
is a simple Lie algebra g1 containing g as a subalgebra so that, as g-modules,
g1 ∼
   = g ⊕ Eγs . The following table lists the possibilities:
                                    g            g1
                                   Bn          Dn+1
                                   Cn          A2n−1
                                   F4           E6
                                   G2           B3
                                        Table 2.11

Proof. This is easily checked by direct calculation.


§3. We now consider the simple Lie algebras g having two different root lengths. We
use Lemma 3.1 below to restrict the possibilities for Z = G/Q for which Hol (D) 6=
G0 or G. We then treat each of the possible flag manifolds Z separately.
  The following lemma will help us determine when (2.6) is zero for E = Eγs .

Lemma 3.1. Suppose there are roots β1 , . . . , βm ∈ ∆+ , not necessarily distinct,
             Pk                                                 Pm
so that γs − j=1 βj is a root for each k = 1, · · · , m and γs − j=1 βj is a long
root in u. Then Homq (Eγs , g/q) = 0.

Proof. Suppose φ ∈ Homq (Eγs , g/q) is nonzero. If v+ is a highest weight vector in
Eγs then φ(v+ ) is a root vector Xγs of weight γs . P    Since weights of Eγs all have
                                                            m
norm less than or equal to k γs k, the long root γs − j=1 βj is not a weight. Thus
X−β1 · · · X−βm · v+ = 0. On the other hand, ad(X−β1 ) · · · ad(X−βm ) · Xγs 6= 0 in
              Pk                                                              Pm
g since γs − j=1 βj is a root for each k = 1, · · · , m. Since the root γs − j=1 βj
is in u, ad(X−β1 ) · · · ad(X−βm ) · Xγs 6= 0 in g/q. But this is a contradiction; 0 =
φ(X−β1 · · · X−βm · v+ ) = ad(X−β1 ) · · · ad(X−βm ) · Xγs 6= 0. 

   For the simple Lie algebras with two root lengths, we number the simple roots
as follows:




The fundamental weight corresponding to αj is denoted by λj . Recall that a weight
λ determines a parabolic subgroup Q with Lie algebra q = q(λ) by ∆(h, q) = {α ∈
∆ | hλ, αi ≤ 0}. Each parabolic
                           P     subalgebra is conjugate to some q(λ), in fact, is
conjugate to one with λ =     λj for some Φ ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , rank g}.
                            j∈Φ


Theorem 3.2. Hol (D) is G if G0 is compact and is G0 if G0 is non-compact,
except possibly in the following cases:

                           Type Bn : Q is determined by λn ,
                           Type Cn : Q is determined by λ1
                           Type G2 : Q is determined by λ1 .

Proof. To apply Lemma 3.1 we find, for each simple Lie algebra
                                                            Pm having more than
one root length, roots βj as in the lemma so that hλj , γs − j=1 βj i > 0 for all λj
except those listed in the theorem.
                       Pn
   For type Bn , γs = j=1 αj and γs − αn is a long root. (So m = 1, β1 = αn in
Lemma 3.1.) Clearly hλj , γs − αn i > 0 except for j = n.
   For type Cn , γs = α1 + 2α2 + 2α3 + · · · + 2αn−1 + αn and γs − α1 is a long root.
(So m = 1, β1 = α1 in Lemma 3.1.) Clearly hλj , γs − α1 i > 0 except for j = 1.
   For type G2 , γs = 2α1 + α2 and γs − 2α1 (= α2 ) is a long root. (So m = 2, β1 =
β2 = α2 in Lemma 3.1.) Clearly hλ2 , γs − 2α1 i > 0.
   For type F4 , γs = 2α1 + 3α2 + 2α3 + α4 and γs − α2 is a long root. (So m =
1, β1 = α2 in Lemma 3.1.) Clearly hλj , γs − α2 i > 0 for all j. Thus, every parabolic
subalgebra of F4 satisfies the condition of Lemma 3.1. 

   We now prove our main theorem by looking at each flag manifold listed in The-
orem 3.2.
      THE AUTOMORPHISM GROUPS OF COMPLEX HOMOGENEOUS SPACES                             9

  Type Bn . Let p, q be positive integers such that p + q = n. The complex group
G = SO(2n + 1, C) is defined by the symmetric form on C2n+1 :

                                     2p              2p+2q+1
                                     X                X
                          (w, z) =         wj zj −             wj zj .
                                     j=1             j=2p+1


The relevant real form G0 of Bn is the connected component of the isometry group of
( , ) restricted to R2n+1 . That is, G0 ∼
                                        = SOe (2p, 2q + 1). The complex flag manifold
Z is the space of all maximal isotropic subspaces of C2n+1 , also known as the space
of pure spinors. The set of (p + q)-planes ζ ∈ Z such that the hermitian form
hw, zi := (w, z̄) restricted to ζ has signature (p, q) contains two open G0 -orbits.
They are D± = G0 .z0± , where z0± = spanC {e1 ± ie2 , e3 + ie4 , . . . , e2n−1 + ie2n }.
These are the only open orbits of G0 in Z.
                                                P2p            P2p+2q+2
    Let G1 be the isometry group of (w, z)1 = j=1 wj zj − j=2p+1 wj zj on C2n+2 .
Let G10 be the connected component of the isometry group of ( , )1 restricted to
R2n+2 . Then, G10 ∼  = SOe (2p, 2q + 2). The space of maximal isotropic subspaces in
C2n+2 has two connected components (since the dimension is even). Take Z 1 to be
the component containing z01 = spanC {e1 + ie2 , . . . , e2n+1 + ie2n+2 }. (The other
component contains spanC {e1 + ie2 , . . . , e2n−1 + ie2n , e2n+1 − ie2n+2 }.) Then Z 1 is
a flag manifold for G1 . Again, there are two open orbits D± 1 consisting of planes
of signature (p, q + 1) with respect to the hermitian form hw, zi1 := (w, z̄)1 .
    Define a map π : Z 1 → Z by π(ζ) = ζ ∩ (C2n+1 × {0}). Note that π(ζ) ∈ Z as
it is clearly isotropic and dim(π(ζ)) = n. It is also clear that π is G0 -equivariant.
By equivariance, π is onto. To see that π is one-to-one it is enough to check that
π −1 (z0 ) = {z01 }. Suppose π(ζ) = ζ ∩ (C2n+1 × {0}) = z0 . Then z0 ⊂ ζ and
there is v ∈ ζ so that v ∈ z0 ⊥( , ) ∩ z0 ⊥h , i = (z0 + z0 )⊥ and ζ = z0 ⊕ C · v. But
(z0 + z0 )⊥ = spanC {e2n+1 , e2n+2 }. As v is isotropic it is either e2n+1 + ie2n+2 or
e2n+1 − ie2n+2 . Only v = e2n+1 + ie2n+2 gives ζ ∈ Z 1 , so ζ = z01 .
    We may conclude that G acts transitively on Z 1 ∼   = Z and G0 acts transitively on
   1 ∼                       1        1
D± = D± . Equivalently, G and G0 act on Z and D± , respectively. It also follows
that the compact real form acts on the G0 -orbit Z.
                               Pn
    Type Cn . Let ω(w, z) = j=1 (wj zn+j − wn+j zj ) be the standard symplectic
form on C2n . Then G = Sp(n, C) is the complex group preserving ω. The complex
flag manifold under consideration is Z = {ω-isotropic lines in C2n }, which is just
CP2n−1 , since any line is automatically isotropic. There are two families of real
forms: Sp(n, R) and Sp(p, q).

PnDefine G0 = U(n, n) ∩ G, where∼U(n, n) is the isometry group of hw, zi =
  j=1 (wj zj − wn+j zn+j ). Then G0 = Sp(n, R). There are two open G0 -orbits,
D± : the positive lines and the negative lines. But, it is clear from Witt’s theorem
that G10 = SU(n, n) acts transitively on D± .
10                    EDWARD G. DUNNE AND ROGER ZIERAU

   For the other real forms, take G0 = U(2p, 2q)∩G, where U(2p, 2q) is the isometry
                    Pp                             Pp+q
group of hw, zi =       j=1 (wj zj + wn+j zn+j ) −  j=p+1 (wj zj + wn+j zn+j ), where
                     ∼
p + q = n. Then G0 = Sp(p, q), (cf. [7], p. 445). For pq 6= 0, G0 has two open orbits
consisting of positive and negative lines. Also, G10 = SU(2p, 2q) acts transitively
on each of these orbits. If pq = 0, then G0 is compact and acts transitively on
Z = CP2n−1 . The unitary group SU(2n) also acts transitively on Z.
    Type G2 . Let G be the complex group of type G2 and let G1 be the complex
group of type B3 . Let G0 and G10 be the split real forms of G and G1 , respectively.
We first recall how G0 ⊂ G10 and G ⊂ G1 . The split real form G0 of type G2 is the
automorphism group of the split octonions (i.e., the Cayley numbers), Õ. There is
a natural inner product of signature (4, 4) defined on Õ. It is easy to see that any
automorphism must preserve the inner product. Since an automorphism must fix
1 ∈ Õ, it must preserve Im Õ := (R · 1)⊥ , the pure imaginary octonions. Moreover,
an automorphism is completely determined by its restriction to Im Õ. We see, then,
that G0 ⊆ SOe (3, 4) ∼ = G10 . Complexifying, we obtain a complex symmetric form
( , )C on (Im Õ)C . Similarly, G sits inside the isometry group G1 of ( , )C . There
is a corresponding hermitian form defined by hw, zi := (w, z̄)C .
    Consider the flag manifold for G1 defined by Z = {isotropic lines in (Im Õ)C ∼  =
C7 }. This is a flag manifold for G under the action of G as a subgroup of G1 . The
proof of this is similar to the proof of Claim 3.5 below and is sketched at the end of
this section. We will see that G10 = SOe (3, 4) acts on Z with two open orbits D±
and that G0 acts transitively on both.
    The action of G10 ∼
                      = SOe (3, 4) has two open orbits, D± , respectively, the positive
and negative lines (with respect to h , i) in Z. We verify this as follows. Write
z = x + iy ∈ (Im Õ)C = Im Õ + i Im Õ with x, y ∈ Im Õ. Then z is positive and
isotropic if and only if:

(3.4)                     (x, x) = (y, y) > 0 and (x, y) = 0 .

Suppose z ′ = x′ + iy ′ is another positive isotropic vector. By scaling z, we may
assume (x, x) = (x′ , x′ ) and (y, y) = (y ′ , y ′ ). Now, Witt’s theorem says that there
is an isometry of Im Õ ∼ = R3,4 taking x to x′ and y to y ′ , i.e., taking z to z ′ . One
can check that this isometry can be chosen to lie in SOe (3, 4).

Claim 3.5. G0 acts transitively on D± .

We use the following lemma, which follows easily from the development in Chapter 6
of [6].

Lemma 3.6. Suppose A, A′ ⊂ Õ are normed subalgebras both isomorphic to
either the quaternions H or the 2 × 2 real matrices M2 (R), then any isomorphism
A → A′ extends to an automorphism of Õ.
        THE AUTOMORPHISM GROUPS OF COMPLEX HOMOGENEOUS SPACES                          11

Proof. Choose ǫ ∈ A⊥ and ǫ′ ∈ (A′ )⊥ with (ǫ, ǫ) = −1 = (ǫ′ , ǫ′ ). Then, by
Lemma 6.15 of [6], A⊥ = Aǫ and Õ = A ⊕ Aǫ. Moreover, multiplication in Õ
is given by
(3.7)                                          ¯ + (da + bc̄)ǫ ,
                      (a + bǫ)(c + dǫ) = (ac + db)
where the bar denotes conjugation in A: the usual conjugation for H and
                                                              
                                   α   β                δ   −β
                                               =
                                   γ   δ               −γ   α

for M2 (R). Similarly for Õ = A′ ⊕A′ ǫ′ . Now suppose f : A → A′ is an isomorphism.
Then, as one can readily check, F (a + bǫ) := f (a) + f (b)ǫ′ is an automorphism of
Õ. 

Remark 3.8.. In case A = A′ , Fǫ′ (a + bǫ) := f (a) + f (b)ǫ′ extends f to an auto-
morphism of Õ for any ǫ′ ∈ A⊥ with (ǫ′ , ǫ′ ) = −1. In fact, any automorphism of
Õ that preserves A must send ǫ to such an ǫ′ . Therefore, all extensions of f are of
this form.

Proof of Claim 3.5. If z and z ′ are two elements in D+ with z = x + iy and
z ′ = x′ + iy ′ , then both decompositions must satisfy (3.4). By Proposition 6.40 of
[6], the subalgebras A and A′ of Õ generated by {x, y} and {x′ , y ′ } are isomorphic
to H, say, φ : A → H and φ′ : A′ → H. Then, f = φ−1 ◦ φ′ : A′ → A is an
isomorphism from A′ to A.
   Now, both x, y and f (x′ ), f (y ′ ) satisfy (3.4). By rescaling z ′ , if necessary, we
may assume (x, x) = (f (x′ ), f (x′ )). Also, Aut(H) consists solely of the conjugations
by unit quaternions, which is the map SU(2) → SO(3), acting on Im(H) ∼          = R3 . By
Witt’s theorem, there is an orthogonal map h (i.e. an automorphism of H) sending
f (x′ ) to x and f (y ′ ) to y. Then, h ◦ f extends to an automorphism g of Õ, by
Lemma 3.6. Thus, we have an element g ∈ G0 with g(z ′ ) = z.
   For z, z ′ ∈ D− , the argument is similar. Now, however, the subalgebras A and
A′ generated by {x, y} and {x′ , y ′ } are isomorphic to M2 (R). Again, there exists
an isomorphism f : A′ → A. The group Aut(M2 (R)) consists solely of conjugations
by elements of SL(2, R), which is the action of SOe (1, 2) on R1,2 ∼
                                                                   = M2 (R) ∩ Im Õ.
                                                       1,2
Again, by Witt’s theorem, there is an isometry h of R such that h(f (x′ )) = x and
h(f (y ′ )) = y. One can check that h may be taken to lie in SOe (1, 2) ∼
                                                                        = SL(2, R).
Now, by Lemma 3.6, h◦f extends to g ∈ Aut(Õ). Thus, we have an element g ∈ G0
with g · z ′ = z. This completes the proof of Claim 3.5. 

Remark 3.9. As homogeneous spaces, the two open orbits are D+ = ∼ G0 /U(2) and
    ∼
D− = G0 /(SL(2, R) × U(1)). This is a consequence of Lemma 3.6 and Remark 3.8,
as we now demonstrate.
12                   EDWARD G. DUNNE AND ROGER ZIERAU

                               L4
   For D+ , write A = H = j=1 Rej with e1 = identity and e2 , e3 , e4 units (i.e.
(ej , ej ) = 1) with e2 e3 = e4 . Suppose g ∈ G0 fixes e2 + ie3 ∈ D+ . Then g fixes
both e2 and e3 . As g is an automorphism, it must also fix e4 , hence all of A.
By Remark 3.8, the automorphisms fixing A are of the form Fαǫ , where α is an
element of A of length one. But, since A ∼    = H, the length-one elements form a
group isomorphic to SU(2). The stabilizer of the line C · (e2 + ie3 ) also includes the
scalars. Therefore, StabG0 (e2 + ie3 ) ∼
                                       = U(2).
   For the orbit D− , take
                          A =M2 (R). We   pick our base point to be the isotropic
                            0 1               1 0
vector x + iy with x =             and y =             . Again, if g ∈ G0 fixes x + iy,
                            1 0               0 −1
then g fixes A. By Remark 3.8, the automorphisms of Õ fixing A are all of the form
Fβǫ where β ∈ A and (β, β) = 1, i.e., det(β) = 1. Thus, the group of automorphisms
fixing the vector x + iy is SL(2, R). As scalars also fix the line C · (x + iy), we have
StabG0 (x + iy) ∼
                = SL(2, R) × U(1).

   We conclude the type G2 case by sketching a proof that Z is a flag manifold for
G. For this it is enough to show that a compact real form of G2 acts transitively
on Z. To do this we use a slightly different realization for G. A compact real form
of G2 is the automorphism group of O, where O is the nonsplit octonians. There
is a positive definite symmetric form on O preserved by the automorphism group,
Aut (O). As above Aut (O) preserves Im O = (R · 1)⊥ , thus Aut (O) ⊆ SO(7). Now
complexify the form to obtain a symmetric form on (Im O)C . The isometry group
is conjugate to G1 (as the form is equivalent to the complex form arising from the
split octonions). The corresponding flag manifold is the space of isotopic lines in
Im O.
   Now let z = x + iy and z ′ = x′ + iy ′ be isotropic vectors in (Im O)C . Then (3.4)
holds for both z and z ′ . The subalgebras A, A′ generated by {x, y} and {x′ , y ′ }
are both isomorphic to H. Now argue as in the case D+ using the fact, analogous
to Lemma 3.6, that an isomorphism A → A′ extends to an automorphism of O.
   Part (3) of the main theorem now follows immediately since the groups G0 or G10
preserve the metric and the corresponding complex groups do not. This completes
the proof of the main theorem.
   Now suppose that G is semisimple. Write g = g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gN with g1 , . . . , gN
simple and let Gi be the subgroups of G corresponding to the gi . A flag manifold
for G is the product of flag manifolds Zi ∼   = Gi /Qi for the Gi . A measurable open
G0 -orbit D is the product of measurable open Gi,0 -orbits Di in the Zi . Recall that
by Proposition 2.3, writing qi = li + ui , if

(3.10)                          pi,− ⊂ ui or pi,+ ⊂ ui

then Hol (Di ) is not a (finite-dimensional) Lie group. Thus, if at least one of the
factors Di satisfies (3.10) then Hol (D) is not a Lie group.
        THE AUTOMORPHISM GROUPS OF COMPLEX HOMOGENEOUS SPACES                            13

Proposition 3.11. If no factor Di satisfies (3.10) or is a hermitian symmetric
space then Hol (D) ∼
                   = Hol (D1 ) × · · · × Hol (DN ).

Proof. By the same argument as in 2.5, Hol (D) is finite dimensional. We look
for representations E such that Homq (E, g/q) 6= 0. The only such irreducible
representations E are E ∼  = gi and E ∼= g1i , the g1i occuring when Zi appears in
Table 1.1. It follows that Hol (D) = Hol (D1 ) × · · · × Hol (Dn ).

§4. The main theorem has several consequences in representation theory. As men-
tioned earlier, interesting representations are those occurring as Dolbeault cohomol-
ogy of a line bundle over an open orbit D. These are the representations associated
to elliptic co-adjoint orbits by the orbit method. See for example [14], [15], [16]
and [18] for some of the important properties of these representations. Suppose we
have a holomorphic homogeneous line bundle Lχ → G0 /L0 corresponding to the
character of L0 whose differential is χ ∈ it∗0 . If

(4.1)                       hχ + ρ, βi < 0, for all β ∈ ∆(u)

(where ρ is half the sum of the positive roots) then the Dolbeault cohomology space
H p (G0 /L0 , Lχ ) = 0 for p 6= s = dimC (K0 · z0 ) and H s (G0 /L0 , Lχ ) is an irreducible
admissible representation. When G0 is non-compact the main theorem gives the
cases where Hol (D) = G10 + G0 . From the case-by-case descriptions given in Sec-
tion 3, it is clear that D ∼   = G0 /L0 ∼= G10 /L10 is an open orbit in a flag manifold for
G . The character defining Lχ extends uniquely to a character of L10 whose differ-
  1

ential we will call χ1 . Thus the bundles Lχ → G0 /L0 and Lχ1 → G10 /L10 are holo-
morphically and G0 -equivariantly equivalent, implying the Dolbeault cohomology
spaces are G0 -isomorphic. Thus, in the range where (4.1) holds, the representations
H s (G10 /L10 , Lχ ) are irreducible representations of G10 which remain irreducible when
restricted to G0 . Put differently, the irreducible representations H s (G0 /L0 , Lχ ) of
G0 extend to representations of G10 . This is a somewhat rare phenomenon. Wolf
[20] obtained some general results on the irreducibility of a representation when
restricted to a subgroup, which have some overlap with this application of our main
theorem. Also, see [10] for results on restricting representations of this type. More
recently, A. Dvorsky has a number of new results along these lines.
   A well-known and important example of the phenomenon discussed above occurs
in quantum electrodynamics. A family of “massless” representations of the de Sitter
group (SO(2, 3)) extend to representations of the conformal group (SO(2, 4)), cf. [1].
As these representations can be realized naturally in Dolbeault cohomology (for the
open orbits in the first entry of Table 1.1 for p = 1 and q = 1), the geometric
explanation for this extension is an instance of our main theorem.
   When G0 is compact, for arbitrary χ, H p (G0 /L0 , Lχ ) ∼ = H p (G10 /L10 , Lχ1 ) as
G0 representations for all p. By the Bott-Borel-Weil theorem we see that certain

representations of G10 remain irreducible when restricted to G0 . The following table
gives the highest weights χ and χ1 of these representations.

   Our results also have implications for the study of deformations of maximal
compact subvarieties in D, as in [4], [19], [24]. In particular, let V0 be the compact
subvariety K0 · z0 in D = G0 /L0 , where G0 is non-compact and D is, as usual,
an open orbit in a generalized flag manifold for G. The cycle space MD studied
in [19] is the space of translations of V0 by elements of G which remain in D:
MD = {g · V ⊂ D | g ∈ G}. The space MD plays a key role in constructing a
transform, often called a Penrose transform, for the representations H s (D, Lχ ). In
most cases, MD has the dimension that one computes using Kodaira-Spencer theory
(cf. [11]). However, in some cases, the Kodaira-Spencer theory predicts a larger
space of deformations. For some of these cases (but not all), our results explain
the discrepancy by demonstrating that there is a larger group of automorphisms G10
acting on D. Compare with [13].
   For example, when g is of type Cn and G0 = Sp(n, R) we have seen that the
space of positive lines in CP2n−1 is an open orbit. Then V0 ∼   = CPn−1 . Kodaira-
Spencer theory predicts that the (infinitesimal) deformations of V0 in D come from
H 0 (V0 , N ), where N is the holomorphic conormal bundle of V0 in D. In this exam-
ple, H 0 (V0 , N ) ∼
                   = { symmetric n × n matrices} ⊕ { skew-symmetric n × n matrices}
as representations of K0 . Let’s denote the deformation space of [19] for the groups
G0 = Sp(n, R) and G10 ∼     = SU(n, n) acting on D by MD and MD      1
                                                                       , respectively.
                                        ∼                 1 ∼   1   1
One can check that in this case MD = G0 /K0 and MD = G0 /K0 (cf. [24]). As
dimC (G10 /K01 ) = dim(G0 /K0 ) + n(n−1)
                                      2  , the deformation space of Kodaira-Spencer
is strictly larger than MD in dimension. The extra n(n−1) 2   dimensions come from
the skew matrices B by the action of
                                     
                                0 B
                          exp           ∈ U (n, n) r Sp(n, R)
                                B 0

on V0 . Note that the infinitesimal deformations predicted by Kodaira-Spencer the-
                     1
ory all come from MD   .
   As a final remark, note that the list in [2] of nilpotent co-adjoint orbits ‘sharing’
an orbit with a bigger group has a lot in common with our list. The open orbits we
are considering here are G0 -equivariantly biholomorphic to the elliptic co-adjoint

orbits. It would be interesting to understand the connection between our list and
that of [2] in terms of nilpotent orbits as limits of elliptic orbits.
