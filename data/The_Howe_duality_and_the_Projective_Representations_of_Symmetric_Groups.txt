                                                    Abstract. The symmetric group Sn possesses a nontrivial central extension, whose irre-
                                                    ducible representations, different from the irreducible representations of Sn itself, coincide
                                                    with the irreducible representations of the algebra An generatored by indeterminates τi,j for

                                                 Lately we witness an increase of interest in the study of representations of symmetric
                                             groups. In particular, in their projective representations.
                                                 Recall that the symmetric group Sn has a nontrivial central extension whose irreducible
                                             representations do not reduce to those of Sn but coincide (may be identified) with the
                                             irreducible representations of the algebra An determined by generators τi,j for i 6= j, 1 ≤
                                             i, j ≤ n subject to the relations
                                                                                 2
                                                             τi,j = −τj,i ,     τi,j = 1,      τi,j τk,l = −τk,l τi,j if {i, j} ∩ {k, l} = ∅;
                                                                                                                                                     (1.1)
                                                             τi,j τj,k τi,j = τj,k τi,j τj,k = −τi,k for any i, j, k, l.
                                             In [N1] Nazarov realized irreducible representations of An by means of an orthogonal basis
                                             constructed in each of the spaces of the representations and indicating the action of the
                                             generators τi,i+1 on them (an analog of the Young orthogonal form). In [N2], with the help
                                             of an “odd” analog of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra Nazarov constructed elements of
                                             the algebra Hn = Sn ◦ Cn , the semidirect product of Sn with the Clifford algebra Cn on n
                                             indeterminates. The elements of Hn serve as analogs of Young symmetrizers.
                                                Here I construct one more analog of Young symmetrizers in Hn as well as analogs of Specht
                                             modules (cf. [Ja]) for the algebras An and Hn . This construction is based on another form
                                             of expression of Young symmetrizers for Sn .
                                                Namely, let t be a Young tableau (i.e., a Young diagram filled in with numbers 1 to n),

Then, up to a constant factor, the Young symmetrizer of t is
                                              et = κt ρt .                                    (1.2)
  Let us represent the Young symmetrizer differently. Let I be the sequence obtained by
reading the tableau t along columns left to right and downwards. For each i ∈ I the Jucys–
Murphy elements ([J], [M]) are defined to be
                         X
                 xi =           sαi , where the sαi ∈ Sn are transpositions.
                        α preceeds i

    One can verify that the xi commute with each other. Set
                 Y
           κ̃t =    (j − xi ), where j is the number of the column occupied by i.
                 i∈I

It is subject to a direct verification that et can be also expressed as
                                              et = κ̃t ρt .                                   (1.3)
   I use this other representation of the Young symmetrizers to construct the corresponding
elements in Hn and prove that theyse corresponding elements are idempotents that generate
isotypical ideals. With the help of these elements and their analogs for An I construct a
realization of multiples of irreducible modules similar to Specht modules, cf. [Ja].
   The proofs are based on the Howe duality between Lie superalgebra q(n) and Hn .

                                        §2. Background
   Let Sn be the symmetric group, Cn the Clifford algebra generated by n indeterminates
p1 , . . . , pn subject to the relations
                                p2i = −1, pi pj + pj pi = 0 for i 6= j.
The symmetric group acts on Cn permuting the generators, so we can form a semidirect
product Hn = Sn ◦ Cn . Set
                                              1
                                      τi,j = √ (pi − pj )si,j .
                                               2
As is not difficult to verify, the relations (1.1) hold; hence, the algebra generated by the
τi,j is isomorphic to An . Besides, An supercommutes with Cn ; hence, Hn = An ⊗ Cn , as
superalgebras if we define parity in An by setting p(τi,j ) = 1̄.
   Let V be a superspace of superdimension (n, n) with the fixed basis {ei }ni=1 ∪ {eī }n̄ī=1̄ and
the odd operator
                                   Q : ei 7→ (−1)ī eī ; eī 7→ ei .
The (super)centrilizer of Q in Mat(V ) is denoted by Q(V ), cf. [BL]. We denote the Lie
superalgebras associated with the associative superalgebras Mat(V ) and Q(V ) by gl(V ) and
q(V ), respectively.
   As is shown in [S1], the algebras q(V ) and Hk constitute a Howe-dual pair in the superspace
W = V ⊗k . Therefore, the following decomposition takes place:
                                       W = ⊕ 2−δ(λ) T λ ⊗ V λ ,                               (2.1)
                                             λ

where λ runs over strict partitions of k, T λ is an irreducible (in supersence) Hk -module, V λ
an irrreducible q(n)-module and λn+1 = 0 and where
                          
                            0 if the number of nonzero parts of λ is even
                   δ(λ) =
                            1                     otherwise.

  Select a basis in q(n): let the e∗i be the left dual basis to the {ei }, i = 1, . . . n; 1̄ . . . n̄; set
                         Ei,j = ei ⊗ e∗j + eī ⊗ e∗j̄ ; Fi,j = ei ⊗ e∗j̄ + eī ⊗ e∗j .
Then h = Span(Ei,i and Fi,i : i = 1, . . . , n) is a Cartan subalgebra in q(n) and b =
Span(Ei,j and Fi,j : i ≤ j) is a Borel subalgebra, cf. [Pe].
    If λ is a strict partition and λn+1 = 0, then λ can be interpreted as a linear functional on
h0̄ : set
                                           λ(Eii ) = λi .                                  (2.2)
Let Rλ be the Hk -module equal to the direct sum of 2(l(λ)−δ(λ))/2 copies of T λ . It is not
difficult to see that Rλ coincides with the set of b-highest weight vectors of weight λ in W .
2.1. Lemma . Let µ be a strict partition, µn+1 = 0. Let V µ be an isotypical modul of type
µ and nµ the multiplicity of the highsest weight vector in V µ . Then the highest weights of
V µ ⊗ V are of the form µ + εi , where the εi are the weights of V , and their multiplicity is
equal to 2nµ .
  Proof follows easily from the multiplication table of the projective Schur functions, see
[P].
2.2. Lemma . Let g = q(n); b and h be defined as above and V a g-module. Let Vλ+ be the
set of b-highest vector of weight λ.
   If u ∈ U(g) and uVλ+ ⊂ Vλ+ , then there exists w ∈ U(h) such that u|V + = w|V + .
                                                                           λ       λ
                 P
Proof. Let u =      uα be the weight decomposition of u ∈ U(g) with    Prespect to h0̄ , the even
part of the Cartan subalgebra h. Therefore, if v ∈ Vλ , then uv = α uα v and, if uα v 6= 0,
then the weight of uα v is equal to λ + α. Thus, we may assume that u = u0 ∈ U(g)h0̄ , where
U(g)h0̄ is the centralizer of h.
   Thanks to [S2], we know that U(g)h0̄ ∼ = U(h) ⊕ L, where L = U(g)h0̄ ∩ U(g)b+ , where b+
is the linear span of the positive roots in b, is a twosided ideal in U(g)h0̄ .
   Hence, u = w + u1 , where w ∈ U(h) and u1 ∈ L; this implies that uv = wv for v ∈ Vλ .

                                  §3. Specht modules over Hk
  Let λ be aP strict partition and t the shifted tableau of the form λ, where λ1 > λ2 > · · · >
λn > 0 and      λi = k. Let us fill in the tableau with the numbers 1 to k and define the
functional λ on the Cartan subalgebra h by setting
                                       λ(Eii ) = λi ;    λ(Fii ) = 0.
In W = V ⊗k , where V is the standard q(V )-module of dimension (n, n), consider the sub-
module M λ consisting of the vectors of weight λ. P
  Again, let Rt be the row stabilizer of t and ρt = σ∈Rt σ. Let I be the sequence obtained
                                                                                    P
by reading the tableau t downwards and from left to right. For i ∈ I define: πi =      τα,i ,
where the sum runs over all the α’s, α ∈ I, that preceed i ∈ I.
  It is subject to a direct verification that
                                       πi πj + πj πi = 0 for i 6= j.
These are odd analogs of the Jucys-Murphy elements. Set

                                κt =     ( j(j + 1) − πi2 ),

3.1. Theorem . Let vt ∈ M λ be the vector whose stabilizer is Rt . Then κt (vt ) 6= 0, κt (vt ) ∈
Rλ and κt (M λ ) = Ck κt (vt ).
                      P
Proof. Induction on       λi = k. It suffices to assume that t is filled in consequently colum-
nwise, from left to right and downwards. Let s be the tableau obtained from t by deleting
the last cell and µ the corresponding partition while l is the length of the last column and r
is its number. Then κt = κs · κk , where κs corresponds to tableau s and κk = 12 r(r + 1) − πk2 .
   By induction, κs (M µ ) = Ck−1κs (vs ) ⊂ Rµ . Therefore, κs (M ν ) = 0 for any ν > µ ordered
with respect to dominance, cf. [M]. Hence,
                                               n
                                  κs (M λ ) = ⊕ κs (M λ−εi ) ⊗ ei .
                                              i=1

If i > l, then λ − εi > λ − εl = µ and, by induction, κs (M λ−εi ) = 0. Hence,
                                               l
                                  κs (M λ ) = ⊕ κs (M λ−εi ) ⊗ ei .
                                              i=1

   The inequality ν ≥ λ − εi true for i < l implies that ν ≥ µ, so the same irreducible
Hk−1 -modules enter the decomposition of M λ−εi as those that enter that of M µ . Therefore,
if mi ∈ M λ−εi and κs (mi ) 6= 0, then there exist m ∈ M µ and a homomorphism ϕi : M µ −→
M λ−εi such that
                                          ϕi (m) = mi .
Applying κs to this identity we get
                       κs (mi ) = κs (ϕi (m)) = ϕi (κs (m)) ∈ Ck−1 κs (vs ).
   The Howe duality between q(n) and Hk−1 allows us to assume that ϕi ∈ U(q(n)). This
proves that κs (M λ ) ⊂ V µ ⊗ V , where V µ is the q(n)-submodule of V ⊗(k−1) generated by
κs (M µ ). By Lemma 2.1 the highest weights of V µ ⊗ V are of the form µ + εi , so the possible
weights are only
                         µ + ε1 , µ + εl = λ and µ + εi < µ + εl if i > l.
So the submodule generated by the weights µ + εi for i > l does not contain weight λ; hence,
neither does it contain κs (M λ ).
   Therefore, κs (M λ ) is contained in the submodule generated by the highest weight vectors
of weight µ + ε1 and µ + εl . By Lemma 2.1 all the highest weight vectors form a free
Ck -module with two generators whose weights are µ + ε1 and µ + εl ; so in each of these
submodules the operator πk2 acts by multiplying by a constant. Let v ∈ V ⊗(k−1) and ei ∈ V .
Then it is not difficult to verify that
                                            1 X
                            πk (v ⊗ ei ) = √         (Fij − pk Eij (v ⊗ ei )),
                                             2 1≤i≤n
where pi is the change of parity operator in the i-th factor of V ⊗k .

Therefore, it suffices to demonstrate that

3.2. Remark . By [N2] (Th. 7.2) for any strict partition µ there exist elements ψS ∈ Rµ ,
where S is the standard tableau of type µ, such that pψS constitute a basis of Rµ while p
runs over Cn . Moreover, the action of the elements
                                        X
                                  xk =      (sik + sik pi pk )
                                                       i<k

is given by the formula
                                      xk ψS = CS (k)ψΛ ,
                p
where CS (k) = (j − i)(j − i + 1) and k occupies the (i, j)-th slot.
  In the above notations                       √
                                        xk = 2pk πk ,
hence, x2k = 2πk and

As earlier, we assume that the tableau is filled in left to right and downwards along columns.
   Let us show that if µ ≥ λ, then κt ψS = 0 for any standard tableau S of type µ and distinct
from t.
   Let k be the number occupying the last place of the last column in the tableau t (filled in
left to right and downwards). Let t∗ be the tableau obtained from t by deleting the box with
k; let S ∗ be similarly constructed from S. If µ∗ ≥ λ∗ (shapes of S ∗ and t∗ , respectively),
then the induction hypothsis applies. If µ∗ < λ∗ , then µ1 = λ1 + 1 and k occupies the last
6                                       ALEXANDER SERGEEV

position of the first row of S. Hence, if j is the number of the column of t occupied by k,
then
                            πk2 (vS ) = 21 (j + 1 − 1)(j + 1 − 1 + 1)vS =
                             1

                           2
Hence, 2 j(j + 1) − πk ψS = 0 and κt ψS = 0.
  This argument shows that κt is the projection in M Λ onto the subspace generated by ψt .
  At the same time
                           κk ψt = 12 (j(j + 1) − (j − i)(j − i + 1)) ψt =
                            ij − 21 i(i − 1) ψt 6= 0.
3.3. Specht modules. Recall that the Specht module for a strict partition λ is the sub-
module in M λ generated by the vectors κt vt for all tableaux t, where vt is the vector whose
stabilizer is equal to Rt .
3.3.1. Theorem . Specht module is equal to Rλ . It is isotypical and its Hk -centralizer is
isomorphic to the Clifford algebra with l(λ) generators.
Proof. Let us realize Rλ as the set of highest weight vectors in V ⊗k . By the Howe duality
between U(q(V )) and Hk the algebra of Hk -homomorphisms is generated by U(q(V )). But
thanks to Lemma 2.2 we may assume that the algebra of Hk -homomorphisms is generated
by U(h) for the Cartan subalgebra h of q(V ). If λi = 0, then in our notations for the basis
of h we have
                                   Fii2 = Eii = λi = 0 in Rλ
and, therefore, ker Fii is an h-submodule in the set (V λ )+ of highest weight vectors. But
(V λ )+ is irreducible as h-module; hence, Fii |(V λ )+ = 0 which implies Fii |Rλ = 0. Thus, the
algebra of Hk -homomorphisms is generated by the Fii for i such that λi 6= 0.
   By Theorem 3.1 the Specht module is contained in Rλ and any homomorphism of M λ
sends Rλ into itself. Hence, the Specht module coinsides with Rλ .

3.3.2. Corollary . Set pit =
                             P
                               pα , where the α belongs to the i-th column of tableau t.
Then for any Hk -module endomorphism ϕ of M λ we have
                                           ϕ(κt vt ) = f · κt vt ,
                                                                               l(λ)
where f belongs to the subalgebra of Ck generated by p1t , . . . , pt .
Proof. Let us realize M λ as the subset of vectors of weight λ in V ⊗k . Then any endomorphism
of M λ may be identified with an element of U(q(V )); the restriction of this endomorphism
on Rλ may be identified with an element of U(h).
   By Theorem 3.3.1 the endomorphism algebra of Rλ is generated by the Fii and to prove
the corollary, it suffices to verify it for these elements. We have
                           Fii (κt vt ) = κt (Fii vt ) = κt (pit vt ) = pit κt (vt )


3.3.3. Corollary . Let ϕ : M λ −→ M λ be an Hk -module endomorphism given by the
formula ϕ(vt ) = ρt κt (vt ). Then ϕ|Rλ = c ∈ C.
Proof. Let us show that ϕ commutes with the endomorphisms Fii . Indeed,
                          ϕ · Fii (vt ) = ϕ(pit vt ) = pit ϕ(vt ) = pit ρt κt (vt );
                          Fii · ϕ(vt ) = Fii ρt κt (vt ) = ρt κt (Fii vt ) =
                          ρt κt (pit vt ) = ρt pit κt (vt ) = pit ρt κt (vt ).
                    PROJECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF SYMMETRIC GROUPS                                     7

The latter identity holds thanks to the fact that pit commutes with ρt .
  Thus, ϕ · Fii (vt ) = Fii · ϕ(vt ) and, since the elements vt generate the Hk -module M λ , we
have
                                           ϕ · Fii = Fii · ϕ.
Since ϕ(Rλ ) ⊂ Rλ for any endomorphism ϕ of M λ , it follows that ϕ|Rλ is an element from
the centralizer of Rλ . But by Theorem 3.3.1 the centralizer is the Clifford algebra Cl(λ) . But
ϕ is an even central element of Cl(λ) , hence, ϕ is a constant.

3.3.4. Corollary . Set et = κt ρt . Then
                                     e2t = c · et for c ∈ C, c 6= 0
and the algebra et Hk et is isomorphic to Cl(λ) and is generated by the pit for 1 ≤ i ≤ l(λ).
Proof. Thanks to Corollary 3.3.3
                                  ϕ(κt (vt )) = κt ρt κt (vt ) = cκt (vt )
or, equivalently,
                                           e2t = c · et .
Since the constant term of κt ρt , equal to the coefficient of vt in κt (vt ), is nonzero, as follows
from the proof of Theorem 3.3.1, then the routine arguments with the help of the bases (cf.
[W]) shows that c 6= 0.
   Moreover, the algebra et Hk et is anti-isomorphic to the algebra of Hk -endomorphism of
the submodule of M λ generated by κt (vt ). Denote the latter module by R1λ . Thanks to
Corollary 3.3.2 if ϕ is an endomorphism of Rλ , then ϕ(R1λ ) ⊂ R1λ and the restriction map
ϕ|κt (vt ) determines an antiisomorphism of EndHk (Rλ ) into the algebra generated by the pit
for 1 ≤ i ≤ l(λ). But the latter algebra is isomorphic to C(λ) ; hence, ϕ|κt (vt ) is an anti-
isomorphism and R1λ = Rλ .

                              §4. The Specht modules over Ak
  In this section we construct analogs of the modules M λ and the Specht modules Rλ for
Ak .
  First, we need the following statement.
                                                                 P
4.1. Lemma . Let π1 = τ12 , . . . , π2 = τ13 + τ23 , . . . , πk = α<k ταk be odd analogs of
Jucys–Murphy’s elements. Then
                                          Y       2
                                    ek =               πi2
                                          i≥2
                                              i(i − 1)
is an idempotent and ek Ak ek is isomorphic to the Clifford algebra with k − 1 generators.
Proof. It is easy to verify by induction that
                                      1 X
                                 ek =        (−1)α 2k−α−1 Σ2α+1 ,
                                      k! α≥0
where Σ2α+1 is the sum of all elements from Ak of the form τi1 i2 τi2 i3 . . . τi2α i2α+1 . This implies
that P
     ek is a central element
                           P that does not vary under the replacement of the sequence
πi = α<i ταi with πσ(i) = α<i τσ(α)σ(i) for any i and σ ∈ Sk ∗. It is not difficult to verify
that
                        (τ12 + τ23 + τ31 ) · (2 − τ12 τ23 + τ13 τ32 ) = 0.
8                                            ALEXANDER SERGEEV

Since
                             2 − τ12 τ23 + τ13 τ32 = π22 = (τ13 + τ23 )2
is a factor in the expression for ek , it follows that
                                         (τ12 + τ23 + τ31 )ek = 0.
From symmetry considerations
                      (τij + τjl + τli )ek = 0 for any distinct i, j, l ∈ {1, . . . k}.
Further on,
                            πi2 = ( P  ταi )2 = i − 1 − (ταβ τβi + τβα ταi ) =
                                   P                   P
                            i − 1 − ( (1 + ταβ τβi + τP βα ταi ) − 1) =
                            i − 1 + 12 (i − 1)(i − 2) − ταβ (ταβ + τβi + τiα ).
Hence, πi2 ek = 21 (i − 1)(i − 2)ek and, therefore,
                                                                 !
                                              Y         2
                                     e2k =                  π2       ek = ek .
                                              i≥2
                                                    i(i − 1) i
   Furthermore, since ek is a central element, then ek Ak ek = Ak ek . Let I be the ideal in
Ak generated by the elements τij + τjl + τli ; then en I = 0. Let Ā = Ak /I. In Ā, then, the
following relations hold:
                         1                  1                             1
        τ12 = π2 , τ23 = (π3 − π2 ), τ34 = (π4 − π3 ), . . . , τk−1,k =     (πk − πk−1 ).
                         2                  3                           k−1
Hence, Ā is generated by the πi . Above we showed that πi2 = 12 (i − 1)(i − 2) in Ā. So Ā is
the Clifford algebra genereated by the images of the πi for 2 ≤ i ≤ k.
   Further on, (1 − ek )I = I; so Ak (1 − ek ) ⊃ I, but since Ā is a Clifford algebra (and, in
particular, is simple), then Ak (1−ek ) = I and, therefore, Ak ek ∼                = Ak /I ∼
                                                                   = Ak /(1−ek )Ak ∼       = Ā,
the Clifford algebra with k − 1 generators.
    Let λ be a strict partition and t a λ-tableau. For 1 ≤ i ≤ l(λ) set

                                                                                       λi .
       t
Let M be the subspace of W spanned by the vectors w ∈ W such that
                              Eii w = λi w;     Fii w = pit w for 1 ≤ i ≤ l(λ).
                           σi ; let Rt be the set of highest weight vectors that belong to M t .

Set also σt =

4.2. Theorem . a) As Ak -module, M t is isomorphic to Ak σt .
   b) The Ak -submodule in M t generated by the κt′ vt , where t′ has the same rows as t, is an
isotypical one and its centralizer is isomorphic to the Clifford algebra Ck−l(λ) .
Proof. Since σt vt = c · vt , heading a) is clear.
  The facts vt ∈ M t and Ak vt ⊂ Rt are also clear.
  Let us show first of all that the centralizer of Rt is isomorphic to the Clifford algebra
Ck−l(λ) .
  Obviously, Ak and Ck ⊗ U(q(V )) form a Howe-dual pair in W . By Theorem 3.3.1 the
centralizer of the Hk -module Rλ is the Clifford algebra generated by the Fii for 1 ≤ i ≤ l(λ).
                     PROJECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF SYMMETRIC GROUPS                                      9

Therefore, the centralizer of the Ak -module Rλ is the Clifford algebra Ck+l(λ) generated by
the Fii for 1 ≤ i ≤ l(λ) and p1 , . . . , pk .
  The condition Fii w = pit w is equivalent to another one: ew = w for

Therefore, the centralizer of Rt is isomorphic to eCk+l(λ) e.
  Let Ck−l(λ) be the subalgebra of Ck generated by the pi − pj for i, j that belong to the
same row of t. Then it is not difficult to see that eCk+l(λ) e ∼    = Ck−l(λ) and this proves that
the centralizer of Rt is isomorphic to Ck−l(λ) .
  Let us prove now that the submodule R1t of Rt generated by the elements κt′ vt , where t′
has, up to permutations, the same rows as t, is isomorphic to Rt . To this end it suffices to
prove that any endomorphism of Rt sends R1t into itself.
  But, indeed, any endomorphism of Rt is a multiplication by pi − pj for i, j that belong to
the same row of t. Now, it suffices to verify that (pi − pj )κt′ vt ∈ R1t . But
                                          √                   √
                        (pi − pj )κt′ vt = 2τij sij κt′ vt = − 2τij κsij (t′ ) vt′ .
But the rows of sij t′ consist of the same elements that constitute the rows of t.
