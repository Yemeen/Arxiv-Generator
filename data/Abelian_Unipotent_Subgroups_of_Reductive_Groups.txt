                                                     A BSTRACT. Let G be a connected reductive group defined over an algebraically
                                                     closed field k of characteristic p > 0. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First,
                                                     when p is a good prime, we give a new proof of the “order formula” of D. Tester-
                                                     man for unipotent elements in G; moreover, we show that the same formula deter-
                                                     mines the p-nilpotence degree of the corresponding nilpotent elements in the Lie
                                                     algebra g of G.
                                                         Second, if G is semisimple and p is sufficiently large, we show that G always
                                                     has a faithful representation (ρ, V ) with the property that the exponential of dρ(X)
                                                     lies in ρ(G) for each p-nilpotent X ∈ g. This property permits a simplification of
                                                     the description given by Suslin, Friedlander, and Bendel of the (even) cohomology
                                                     ring for the Frobenius kernels Gd , d ≥ 2. The previous authors already observed
                                                     that the natural representation of a classical group has the above property (with
                                                     no restriction on p). Our methods apply to any Chevalley group and hence give
                                                     the result also for quasisimple groups with “exceptional type” root systems. The
                                                     methods give explicit sufficient conditions on p; for an adjoint semisimple G with
                                                     Coxeter number h, the condition p > 2h − 2 is always good enough.


                                                                                   1. I NTRODUCTION
                                               Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0, and let G be a
                                            connected, reductive group over k. We consider in this paper two questions which
                                            involve the relationship between nilpotent elements in the Lie algebra g of G and
                                            certain unipotent subgroups of G.
                                            1.1. There are finitely many (adjoint) orbits of G on the nilpotent elements of its
                                            Lie algebra g; since g is a p-Lie algebra it is reasonable to ask for each nilpotent
                                                                                                                   m
                                            class Ad(G)X ⊂ g what is the minimal integer m ≥ 1 for which X [p ] = 0.
                                               The analogous question for unipotent elements in G was answered in [Tes95];
                                            D. Testerman gave there a formula for the orders of the unipotent elements in
                                            G. We show here that the answer in both cases is “the same” and that more-
                                            over by first proving the Lie algebra result, one obtains a proof of Testerman’s for-
                                            mula which avoids the calculations with explicit representatives for the unipotent
                                            classes that were carried out in loc. cit.
                                               More precisely, we prove the following:
                                            Theorem. Assume that p is a good prime for the connected reductive group G, and that
                                            P is a distinguished parabolic subgroup of G with unipotent radical V. Write n(P ) for
                                            the nilpotence class of V (which is the same as the nilpotence class of v), and let the integer
                                            m > 0 be minimal with the property that pm ≥ n(P ).
                                               1. The p-nilpotence degree of a Richardson element of v = Lie(V) is m; equivalently,
                                                   the p-exponent of the Lie algebra v is m;

    2. The order of a Richardson element of V is pm ; equivalently, the exponent of V is pm .

   In section 2 we recall general notions and definitions concerning nilpotent group
and nilpotent Lie algebras. There is a simple formula for the nilpotence class n(P )
given in section 4.4. For m as in the theorem, it follows from generalities (see
Lemma 2.1 and Proposition 4.4) that the p-nilpotence degree of X is ≤ m and that
the order of u is ≤ pm . Thus, the theorem amounts to the following assertions: the
exponent of V and the p-exponent of v are as large as permitted by their respective
nilpotence class.
   In section 3, we discuss connected, Abelian, unipotent algebraic groups. In
characteristic 0, any such group is a vector group, but that is not true in posi-
tive characteristic. On the other hand, in the positive characteristic case, any such
group U is isogenous to a product of “Witt vector groups” whose dimensions are
uniquely determined by U . Using this we observe that the p-exponent of Lie(U ) is
≤ logp of the exponent of the group U ; see Proposition 3.6.
   In section 4, we review relevant facts concerning the classification of unipotent
and nilpotent classes for reductive groups. The Bala-Carter theorem, as proved
for all good primes p by Pommerening, parameterizes the nilpotent classes in the
Lie algebra g of G; thanks to a result of Springer, it then also parameterizes the
unipotent classes in G.
   If V is as in the theorem, a result of Spaltenstein shows that the centralizer di-
mension of a Richardson element X ∈ Lie(V) is “the same as in characteristic 0”;
using this fact, we are able to use reduction modulo p arguments to obtain a lower
bound on the nilpotence class of ad(X) which suffices for part (1) of the theorem;
the details are contained in section 5.
   Next, we locate a connected, Abelian, unipotent subgroup Z of G which meets
the Richardson orbit of P on V, and moreover such that z = Lie(Z) meets the
Richardson orbit of P on v. The results in section 3 show now that logp of the
exponent of Z must be ≥ the p-exponent of z, from which we deduce part (2) of
the theorem. This argument is contained in section 6.

1.2. Let H denote a linear algebraic group over k defined over Fp . In [SFB97a]
and [SFB97b], Suslin, Friedlander, and Bendel relate the cohomology of the Frobe-
nius kernel Hd to a certain affine scheme A(d, H) whose k-points coincide with
the set of all group scheme homomorphisms Ga,d → H. In fact, they show that
the spectrum of the even cohomology ring of Hd is homeomorphic to A(d, H). Let
A(d, H) be the variety corresponding to A(d, H) [if A denotes the√     coordinate ring
of the scheme, then the coordinate ring of the variety is A′ = A/ 0; in this case,
the maximal ideals of A′ identify with the above group scheme homomorphisms].
We observe that A(d, H) and A(d, H) are homeomorphic, and in this paper we
will only work with the variety.
    In case H is the full linear group GL(V ) of a k-vectorspace V , A(d, H) has a
simple description as the variety of commuting d-tuples of p-nilpotent elements of
h = gl(V ).
    For general H, one may take a faithful representation (ρ, V ) of H and it was
observed in [SFB97a] that A(d, H) is a somewhat mysterious closed subvariety
of A(d, GL(V )). If for each p-nilpotent X ∈ g the exponential homomorphism
t 7→ exp(dρ(tX)) takes values in H, we say that (ρ, V ) is an exponential-type rep-
resentation. It is shown in loc. cit. that if H has an exponential-type representation,
                  ABELIAN UNIPOTENT SUBGROUPS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS                  3


then A(d, H) may be identified with the variety Np (d, h) of commuting d-tuples of
p-nilpotent elements in h.
    We show in this paper that if G is semisimple and p is sufficiently large, then G
has an exponential-type representation. We consider exponentials in section 7; the
results on exponentials in Chevalley groups may be found in 7.4. As a by-product
of some of our constructions, we obtain also a new proof, for classical groups, of a
recent result of Proud [Pro] concerning Witt-vector subgroups containing unipo-
tent elements; see Theorem 7.5.
    When p does not divide the order of the “fundamental group” of G, we show
that A(d, G) is isomorphic to A(d, Gsc ) as Gsc -varieties, where Gsc is the simply
connected covering group; in this sense, A(d, G) is independent of isogeny. How-
ever, it is not at all clear whether the property of having an exponential-type rep-
resentation is independent of isogeny.
    When G is a classical group, it was observed in [SFB97a] that its “natural”
module V defines an exponential-type representation (in any characteristic); so
long as p does not divide the order of the fundamental group, this shows that
A(d, G′ ) ≃ Np (d, g) for any quasisimple, semisimple group G′ with root system of
type A, B, C or D.
    For a general semisimple group G we show that if p > 2h − 2 (where h is
the Coxeter number), the adjoint module is an exponential-type representation for
the corresponding adjoint group (which is isogenous to G); since this inequality
also guarantees that p doesn’t divide the order of the fundamental group, we get
A(d, G) ≃ Np (d, g) with this condition on p.
    If G is an exceptional group of type E8 , our techniques do no better than the
bound p > 2h − 2 = 58. For the other exceptional groups, we improve this bound
slightly; see 9.5.
    Suppose that G has an exponential-type representation. As observed in [SFB97a,
Remark 1.9], it is not clear whether the resulting isomorphism Np (d, g) → A(d, G)
is intrinsic, or depends on the choice of exponential-type representation. In an at-
tempt to study this question, we consider in section 8 a related result due to Serre
concerning exponentials: if P is a parabolic subgroup of a reductive group G, and
p exceeds the nilpotence class n(P ) of the unipotent radical V of P , then there
is a P -equivariant isomorphism v → V of algebraic groups, where v = Lie(V)
is regarded as an algebraic group via the Hausdorff formula. As a consequence,
we observe in 9.6 that one gets an intrinsically defined morphism of P -varieties
N (d, v) → A(d, V) which we prove is injective. We have not so far been able to
decide whether this morphism should be an isomorphism of varieties, or even
surjective.

1.3. Some notations and conventions. If Λ is any commutative ring, and V a
finitely generated Λ-module, we denote by AutΛ (V ) the linear automorphisms
of V . We denote by GL(V ) the affine group scheme of finite type with GL(V )(Λ′ ) =
AutΛ′ (V ⊗Λ Λ′ ) for each commutative Λ-algebra Λ′ .
   If Λ = E is a field, we mostly prefer to identify affine group schemes of finite
type over E which are absolutely reduced with the corresponding linear algebraic
groups over E. Thus a finite dimensional E-vector space V determines a linear
algebraic group GL(V ) over E; this is an E-form of GL(V ⊗E E), where E denotes
an algebraic closure of E.

            2. N ILPOTENT   ENDOMORPHISMS , GROUPS , AND                 L IE   ALGEBRAS

   If M is an Abelian group and φ is an nilpotent endomorphism of M , the nilpo-
tence degree of φ is the least positive integer e such that φe = 0.
   A group M , respectively a Lie algebra M , is nilpotent provided that its descend-
ing central series M = C 0 M ⊇ C 1 M ⊇ · · · terminates in 1, respectively 0, after
finitely many steps [recall that for i ≥ 1, we have C i M = (M, C i−1 M ) for a group
M , respectively C i M = [M, C i−1 M ] for a Lie algebra M ]. If M is nilpotent, its
nilpotence class is the least e for which C e M is trivial.
   Let k be an algebraically closed field, and let L be the Lie algebra of a linear
algebraic k-group; there is then a well-defined notion of a nilpotent element of
L. Suppose now that the characteristic of k, say p, is positive; then L is a p-Lie
                                                               e
algebra. Evidently X ∈ L is nilpotent if and only if X [p ] = 0 for some e [the map
          e
X 7→ X [p ] is the e-th iteration of the p-power map on L]. The p-nilpotence degree
                                                            e
of a nilpotent X ∈ L is the minimal e for which X [p ] = 0. The element X is said
to be p-nilpotent if its p-nilpotence degree is 1 (i.e. if X [p] = 0).
   We have (see [Bor91, §3.1]) for all X1 , X2 , . . . , Xr ∈ L:

                            r
                                       ![p]       r
                                                         [p]
                            X                     X
(1)                               Xi          ≡         Xi     (mod C p L)
                            i=1                   i=1

    If moreover L is a nilpotent Lie algebra, then each element X ∈ L is nilpotent.
Since L is a finite dimensional p-Lie algebra, the p-nilpotence degree of any X in
L is bounded; call the p-exponent of L the maximum of the p-nilpotence degree of
its elements.

2.1. We have the following general result bounding “exponent” in terms of “nilpo-
tence class”.

Lemma. (a) Let L be a nilpotent Lie algebra with class e. Assume for each i ≥ 0 that
                                                           e
     C i L has a k-basis of p-nilpotent elements. Then X [p ] = 0 for all X ∈ L (i.e. the
     p-exponent of L is ≤ e).
 (b) Let G be a nilpotent group with class e. Assume for each i ≥ 0 that C i G is generated
                                      e
     by elements of order p. Then xp = 1 for all x ∈ G (i.e. the exponent of G is ≤ pe ).

Proof. Note that for X = G or X = L we have C i C j X ⊂ C ij X for all i, j ≥ 1.
                                            Pr              [p]
To prove (a), let X ∈ L and write X = i=1 Xi where Xi = 0 for all i. Then
                                 e−1                                           e
X [p] ∈ C p L by (1). We have C p C p L = 0 by assumption, so by induction X [p ] =
          e−1
(X [p] )[p ] = 0. The proof of (b) is essentially the same.


                            3. A BELIAN UNIPOTENT               GROUPS

      In this section, we recall some basic known facts about Abelian unipotent groups.

3.1. Witt vector groups. Let p > 0 be a prime number, let n ≥ 1 be an integer, and
let Wn,Z(p) denote the group scheme over Z(p) of the “Witt vectors of length n” for
the prime p; see [Ser79, II.§6] and [Ser88, V.§16,VII.§7]. We write Wn = Wn,k for
the corresponding group over k.
                             X p + Y p − (X + Y )p
Example. Let F (X, Y ) =                            ∈ Z[X, Y ]. When n = 2, the opera-
                                       p
tion in W2,Z(p) = A2Z(p)   (here written additively) is defined by the rule
                           ~t + ~s = (t0 + s0 , F (t0 , s0 ) + t1 + s1 ).
More precisely, the co-multiplication for Z(p) [Wn ] = Z(p) [T0 , T1 ] is given by
                                  ∆(T0 ) = T0 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ T0
and
                    ∆(T1 ) = T1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ T1 + F (T0 ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ T0 )

   (1). The underlying scheme of Wn,Z(p) is isomorphic with the affine space An Z(p) ,
hence the structure algebra Z(p) [Wn ] is free over Z(p) .

   (2). There is an isomorphism of Q-group schemes
                                   ≃
                     ϕ : Wn,Q −→ Ga,Q × · · · × Ga,Q              (n factors).
Proof. For m ≥ 1, let
                            m          m−1
               wm = X0p + pX1p               + · · · + pm Xm ∈ Z[X0 , X1 , . . . ].
  We may define a map
                                ϕ : Wn,Q → Ga,Q × · · · × Ga,Q
by assigning, for each Q-algebra Λ and each ~t ∈ Wn,Q (Λ), the value
                            ϕ(~t) = (w0 (~t), w1 (~t), . . . , wn−1 (~t)).
Since p is invertible in Q, it follows from [Ser79, Theorem II.6.7] that ϕ is an iso-
morphism of Q-group schemes. [Note that the assertion is valid over any field F
provided only that the characteristic of the field F is different from p.]
3.2. The Artin-Hasse exponential series. Now let F (t) ∈ Q[[t]] be the power series
                                                            2
                        F (t) = exp(−(t + tp /p + tp /p2 + · · · )).
If µ denotes the Möbius function, one easily checks the identity of formal series
                                    Y

    2. The endomorphism X of L/pL is in the image of the Lie algebra homomorphism
                                    dEX : wn,Fp → gl(L/pL).

Proof. For each Q-algebra Λ and each ~t ∈ Wn (Λ) one uses induction on n and the
definition of the wj to verify that
                     n−1                          n−1
                                                  X n−1−m
                     X                    j           X                       m   l
                           p−j wj (~t)X p =                     p−l (tm X p )p .
                     j=0                          m=0    l=0

It follows that
                                                 
                          n−1                           n−1
                          X                   j         Y              m
                  exp          p−j wj (~t)X p  =            F (tm X p ) = EX (~t),
                          j=0                           m=0

whence (1).
     For (2), let T0 , . . . , Tn−1 denote the coordinate functions on Wn,Fp with Ti (~t) =
ti ; thus A = Fp [Wn ] is a polynomial ring in the Ti . The tangent space to Wn at 0
                                                                    ∂f
contains the “point-derivation” D : A → Fp given by f 7→               |~ , and it is clear
                                                                   ∂T0 t=0
that dEX (D) = X.

3.4. The Lie algebra of the Witt vectors. Let V be a k-vector space of dimension
pn−1 + 1, and let X ∈ Endk (V ) be a nilpotent “Jordan block” of size pn−1 + 1. Thus
  n−1               n
xp     6= 0 while xp = 0. The smallest p-Lie subalgebra of gl(V ) containing x is
                                  Pn−1       i    Pn−1      i
then the Abelian Lie algebra a = i=0 kX p = i=0 kX [p ] .
   Let EX : Wn → GL(V ) be the homomorphism determined by X as in 3.3.
Proposition. If k is a field of characteristic p, then wn = Lie(Wn ) is an Abelian Lie
                                                                     [pi ]
algebra with a k-basis Z0 , Z1 , . . . , Zn−1 such that Zi = Z0              for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

Proof. Let b be the image of dEX ; thus b is a p-Lie subalgebra of gl(V ). According
to Lemma 3.3, b contains X. It follows that a ⊂ b. On the other hand, we have
                       n = dimk a ≤ dimk b ≤ dim Wn,k = n.
Thus a = b ≃ wn , and the proposition follows.
                                                                                 ∂
Example. Say n = 2. Then k[W2 ] = k[T0 , T1 ]. One can show that X0 =               +
                                                                                ∂T0
      ∂                ∂
T0p−1     and X1 =         are W2 -invariant derivations of k[W2 ], and that these
     ∂T1              ∂T1
                                                     [p]
derivations span w2 . A simple computation yields X0 = X1 .
3.5. Exponents.
Proposition.      1. The p-exponent of wn = Lie(Wn ) is n.
  2. The exponent of Wn is pn ; moreover, a Witt vector ~t ∈ Wn (k) has order pn if and
     only if t0 6= 0.
Proof. Part (1) follows immediately from the description of wn given by Proposi-
tion 3.4. For (2), recall [Ser79, Theorem II.6.8] that the ring of (infinite) Witt vec-
tors W(k) is a strict p-ring (see loc. cit. II.5 for the definition) and that Wm (k) ≃
W(k)/pm W(k) for all m ≥ 1. (2) now follows at once.
3.6. Connected Abelian unipotent groups. Recall that two connected Abelian al-
gebraic groups G and H are said to be isogenous if there is a surjection G → H
whose kernel is finite.
Lemma. If G and H are connected Abelian algebraic groups which are isogenous, then
the exponent of G is equal to the exponent of H.
Proof. The lemma is clear if either G or H has infinite exponent, so assume other-
wise. Suppose that φ : G → H is a surjection with finite kernel. Let m be the expo-
nent of H. Since G is Abelian, the map x 7→ xm defines a group homomorphism
G → ker φ; since G is connected and ker φ is finite, this homomorphism must be
trivial. It follows that xm = 1 for all x ∈ G, and this shows that the exponent of G
is ≤ that of H. The inequality ≥ is immediate since φ is surjective.
Proposition. Let U be a connected Abelian unipotent group over k. Then
                                                   Qd
   1. U is isogenous to a product of Witt groups i=1 Wni ,k ; moreover, the integers ni
      are uniquely determined (up to order) by U .
Let n = maxi (ni ) where the ni are as in 1.
   1. The exponent of the group U is pn .
   2. The p-exponent of u = Lie(U ) is ≤ n.
Proof. The first assertion is [Ser88, VII§2 Theorem 1]. The second assertion follows
immediately from the lemma.
   For the last assertion, it is proved in [Ser88, VII§2 Theorem 2] that the group U
is a subgroup of a product of Witt groups. A careful look at the proof in loc. cit.
shows that the exponent of U and this product may be chosen to coincide. Thus,
u is a subalgebra of w, a product of Lie algebras wni with max(pni ) equal to the
exponent of U ; (3) now follows since the p-exponent of the Lie subalgebra u can’t
exceed that of w.

Remark. The p-exponent of Lie(U ) may indeed be strictly smaller than logp of the
exponent of U . Let V2 be the algebraic k-group which is isomorphic as a variety to
A2k , with the group operation in V2 determined by
                        ~t + ~s = (t0 + s0 , F (t0 , s0 )p + t1 + s1 ).

Then the map ϕ : W2 → V2 given by ~t 7→ (tp0 , t1 ) is a (purely inseparable) isogeny.
The exponent of V2 is p2 , but every element x ∈ v2 = Lie(V2 ) satisfies x[p] = 0.
                             ∂        ∂
Indeed, one can check that      and      are V2 -invariant derivations of k[V2 ], and
                            ∂T0     ∂T1
that they span v2 over k.

                                4. R EDUCTIVE       GROUPS

4.1. Generalities. Let G be a connected reductive group over the field k which
is defined and split over the prime field Fp . We fix a maximal torus T contained
in a Borel subgroup B of G. Let X = X ∗ (T ) be the group of characters of T , and
Y = X∗ (T ) be the group of co-characters. The adjoint action of G on its Lie algebra
g is diagonalizable for T ; the non-zero weights of this action form a root system
R ⊂ X, and the choice of Borel subgroup determines a system of positive roots R+
and a system of simple roots S. Write h?, ?i for the canonical pairing X × Y → Z.
   For each root α ∈ R+ , there is a root homomorphism φα : Ga → U ; the sub-
group U is equal to the direct product (in any fixed order) of the images of the root
homomorphisms φα with α > 0.
   For each α ∈ R+ the derivative of φα yields an element eα ∈ u = Lie(U ); the eα
form a basis for u.
4.2. Good primes. We will usually assume that p is a good prime for G. If the root
system of G is indecomposable, let β be the short rootP    of maximal height. In that
case, the prime p is good for G provided that if β ∨ = α∈S aα α∨ , then all aα are
prime to p. For indecomposable root systems, p is bad (=not good) just in case one
of the following holds: p = 2 and R is not of type Ar ; p = 3 and R is of type G2 , F4
or Er ; or p = 5 and R is of type E8 . In general p is good for G if it is good for each
indecomposable component of the root system R.
4.3. Parabolic subgroups. Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G containing the
Borel subgroup B, and let p be the Lie algebra of P . Put I = {α ∈ S | p−α 6= 0}.
The parabolic subgroup P is then
                                P = hB, Im φ−α | α ∈ Ii.
The group P has a Levi decomposition P = LV where L is a reductive group
and V is the unipotent radical of P . The derived group of the Levi factor L is a
semisimple group whose root system RP is generated by the roots in I. Denote by
v = Lie(V) the nilradical of p. The group V is the product of the images of the root
homomorphism φα with α ∈ R+ \ RP .
   There is (see e.g. [Spr98, Ch. 9]) an isogeny
                                       Y
                                 Ĝ =     Gi × T → G
                                          i
where each Gi is semisimple with indecomposable root system, and T is a torus.
Let P̂ denote the parabolic subgroup of Ĝ determined by I, and let V̂ denote its
unipotent radical.
                   ABELIAN UNIPOTENT SUBGROUPS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS                       9


Lemma. The above isogeny restricts to an isomorphism V̂ ≃ V; moreover, we have V̂ ≃
Q
  i V̂i where V̂i = V ∩ Gi .

Proof. This follows from [Bor91, Prop. 22.4].

4.4. Associated with the parabolic subgroup P , we may define a homomorphism
f : ZR → Z given by
                              
                                0 if α ∈ S and −α ∈ RP
                      f (α) =
                                2 if α ∈ S and −α 6∈ RP
                                                                  L
Such a homomorphism
               L        induces a grading of the Lie algebra g =L i∈Z g(i) by
setting g(i) =          g . We have evidently Lie(P ) = p =        i≥0 g(i) and
             P f (α)=i α
Lie(V) = v = i>0 g(i). We have by construction that
                            g(i) 6= 0 =⇒ i ≡ 0     (mod 2).
   When R is indecomposable, let α̃ ∈ R+ be the long root of maximal height, and
let n(P ) = 12 f (α̃) + 1. If we write α̃ as a Z-linear combination of the simple roots
S, then n(P ) − 1 is just the sum of the coefficients in this expression of the roots in
S \ I.
   Note that
                           g(i) 6= 0 =⇒ −f (α̃) ≤ i ≤ f (α̃)
and that Lie(T ) ⊂ g(0) 6= 0 and eα̃ ∈ g(f (α̃)) 6= 0.
  When R is no longer indecomposable, let S ′ be the simple roots for an inde-
composable component R′ of R, and let α̃′ be the highest long root in R′ . Put
            1
n(P, S ′ ) = f (α̃′ ) + 1, and let n(P ) be the supremum of the n(P, S ′ ).
            2
Proposition. Suppose that p is a good prime for G, let P be a distinguished parabolic
subgroup, and let m ≥ 1 be minimal with pm ≥ n(P ).
  (a) The nilpotence class of the Lie algebra v is n(P ).
  (b) The p-exponent of v is ≤ m.
   (c) The nilpotence class of the group V is n(P ).
  (d) The exponent of V is ≤ pm .
Proof. We first prove (a) and (c). By Lemma 4.3, we are reduced to the case where
R is indecomposable.
   Since p is good, [BT73, Prop. 4.7] shows that C j−1 V = f (α)≥2j Im φα for j ≥ 1.
                                                            Q

Essentially the same arguments show that C j−1 v = f (α)≥2j keα . Since every root
                                                        P

α satisfies f (α̃) ≥ f (α); (a) and (c) now follow at once.
   Note that we have showed for all i ≥ 0 that C i v has a basis of p-nilpotent vectors
(the root vectors) and that C i V is generated by elements of order p (the images of
root homomorphisms). By Lemma 2, (b) now follows from (a), and (d) follows
from (c).

Corollary. If p ≥ h, every nilpotent element Y ∈ g satisfies Y [p] = 0 and every unipotent
element 1 6= u ∈ G has order p.
Proof. Let Y be a regular nilpotent element in u = Lie(U ); thus Y is a representative
for the dense B-orbit on u [see the discussion of Richardson’s dense orbit theorem
below in section 4.5]. Since n(B) = h−1, the proposition shows that Y [p] = 0. Since
10                                 GEORGE J. MCNINCH


the regular nilpotent elements form a single dense orbit in the nilpotent variety, we
get Y [p] = 0 for every nilpotent Y .
   The assertion for unipotent elements follows in the same way.

Remarks.     1. Suppose that G is semisimple; thus S is a Q basis for XQ . Then f
     determines, by extension of scalars, a unique Q-linear map fQ : XQ → Q. For
     some q ∈ Z, the homomorphism qfQ maps X to Z, so that qf = φ ∈ Y , the
     group of cocharacters of the maximal torus T . [In fact, this is true even when
     G is only assumed to be reductive, rather than semisimple.] For any such
     integer q, we have g(i) = {Y ∈ g | Ad(φ(t))Y = tqi Y }, which makes it clear
     that the grading of g is a grading as a p-Lie algebra. In particular, if Y ∈ g(i),
     we have Y [p] ∈ g(pi).
  2. The preceding remark permits an alternate proof of (b) of the proposition;
                                                                     m
     indeed, for a homogeneous Y ∈ v(i) [so i > 0], we have Y [p ] ∈ g(pm i) = 0.
  3. The corollary is of course well known; I didn’t find a suitable reference, how-
     ever. Jens Jantzen has pointed out to me a somewhat more elementary argu-
     ment that X [p] = 0 for X ∈ g Pnilpotent when p ≥ h. We may assume X to be
     in u; thus we may write X = α∈R+ aα eα with scalars aα ∈ k. By Jacobson’s
                                                                 [p]
     formula for the p-th power of a sum, X [p] is α∈R+ apα eα + L where L is a
                                                     P
     linear combination of commutators of length p. Now, all summands of L are
     weight vectors of a weight that has height ≥ p. But the maximal height of a
     root is h − 1 < p.
4.5. The Bala-Carter parameterization of nilpotent elements. Let G be connected
and reductive in good characteristic p, and let P = LV be a parabolic subgroup.
The adjoint action P on g leaves v invariant. A theorem of Richardson [Hum95,
Theorem 5.3] guarantees that P has a unique open orbit on v, and a unique open
orbit on V; these are the Richardson orbits of P , and representatives for these orbits
are called Richardson elements.
   A nilpotent element X ∈ g is distinguished if the connected center of G is a max-
imal torus of CG (x). [If G is semisimple, this means that any semisimple element
of CG (x) is central].
   On the other hand, the parabolic subgroup P is called distinguished if
                           dim g(0) − dim Z(G) = dim g(2).
[Note that this differs from the definition in [Car93, p.167], but that Corollary 5.8.3
of loc. cit. shows that it is equivalent in case p is good.]
   The following relates these two notions of distinguished:
Proposition. [Car93, Prop. 5.8.7] If P is distinguished, then a Richardson element in
v is a distinguished nilpotent element. Moreover, the Richardson orbit on v meets g(2) in
an open L-orbit.
     The full Bala-Carter theorem is as follows:
Proposition. Bala,Carter [BC76a, BC76b], Pommerening [Pom77, Pom80] There is
a bijection between the G-orbits of nilpotent elements in g and the conjugacy classes of
pairs (L, Q) where L is a Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup of G, and Q is a dis-
tinguished parabolic subgroup of L. The nilpotent orbit determined by (L, Q) is the one

                               5. T HE p- EXPONENT        OF   v
   Throughout this section and the next, G is a reductive group, P is a distin-
guished parabolic subgroup with Levi decomposition P = LV. The characteristic
p is assumed to be good for G.

5.1. Let A be a discrete valuation ring, with residue field of characteristic p and
quotient field F. We assume chosen some fixed embedding of the residue field of
A in our algebraically closed field k.
   If L is an A-lattice and ψ is a nilpotent A-endomorphism, one might hope to
relate the Jordan block structure of ψk and ψF [If ψ ∈ EndA (L), the corresponding
endomorphisms of LF = L ⊗A F and Lk will be denoted ψF and ψk ]. Since the
dimension of the kernel of a liner transformation is equal to the number of its
Jordan blocks, one must require that dimk ker ψk = dimF ker ψF . However, even
with that condition, the partitions can be different; indeed, let π be a prime element
                                                                L4
of A and consider the endomorphism ψ of the lattice A4 = i=1 Aei determined
by the rules ψ(e1 ) = 0, ψ(e2 ) = ψ(e3 ) = e1 , ψ(e4 ) = (π − 1)e2 + e3 . Then ψF has
partition (3, 1) while ψk has partition (2, 2).
   On the other hand, one has the following straightforward result. Let L be an
A-lattice which is 2Z-graded; say
                                d
                                M
                           L=          L2i ,   L0 6= 0,   L2d 6= 0.
                                 i=0
                        +      +
 Let L+ =
          L
             i>0 L2i , LF and Lk be in each case the sum of the homogeneous
components of positive degree.
Proposition. Suppose ψ ∈ EndA (L) is an endomorphism of degree 2 (i.e. ψ(Li ) ⊆ Li+2
for all i), and assume ψF : LF → L+    F is surjective, so that the nilpotence degree of ψ is
d + 1. If dimk ker ψk = dimF ker ψF , then ψ : L → L+ is surjective. In particular,
ψkd 6= 0, hence the nilpotence degree of ψk is also d + 1.
Proof. It suffices to show that ψk : Lk → L+
                                           k is surjective. Since dimF LF = dimk Lk
and dimF L+              +
            F = dimk Lk , that follows immediately from the assumption on kernel
dimensions.

5.2. Let GZ be a split reductive group scheme over Z which gives rise to G upon
base change. There is a general notion of the Lie algebra gZ of the affine group
scheme GZ ; see [Jan87, I.7.7]. In the case of our split reductive group, gZ may be
described explicitly; see [Jan87, II.1.11]. For any commutative ring A, let gA =
gZ ⊗Z A. The explicit description of gZ implies that it is a Z-lattice in the split
reductive Q-Lie algebra gQ , and that Lie(G) = g = gk . If XZ ∈ gZ , denote by XA
the element XZ ⊗ 1 ∈ gA .
   Let P be a distinguished parabolic subgroup P , and let the map f : ZR → Z
be as in 4.4; then f induces also a grading of gZ (this again relies on the explicit
description of gZ mentioned above).
   Fix an algebraic closure Q of Q.
Lemma. There is a finite subextension Q ⊂ F ⊂ Q and a valuation ring A ⊂ F, whose
residue field we embed in k, such that the following holds: for some XA ∈ gA (2), the
element Xk is Richardson in v, and XF is Richardson in vQ .
12                                 GEORGE J. MCNINCH


   [This lemma is implicit in [Spa84]; we include a proof for the convenience of the
reader.]
Proof. The Richardson orbit on vQ̄ meets gQ̄ (2) in an open set, so we may find a
regular function f on gQ̄ (2) such that f (Y ) 6= 0 implies Y is a Richardson ele-
ment. Using the lattice gZ (2) in gQ̄ (2), we obtain coordinate functions [dual to the
root-vector basis] on gQ̄ (2); let F ⊂ Q̄ by a finite extension of Q containing the coef-
ficients of f with respect to these coordinate functions. Take for A the localization
of the ring of integers of F at some prime lying over (p), and fix some embedding
of the residue field of A in k. If π denotes a prime element of A, we may multiply
f be a suitable power of π and assume that all the coefficients of f are in A, and
that not all are 0 modulo π. Let fˆ ∈ k[g(2)] be the function obtained by reducing f
modulo π. Then the distinguished open set determined by fˆ is non-empty and so
must meet the set of Richardson elements in g(2). After possibly enlarging F and
A, we may suppose that there is a Richardson element X ∈ g(2) with fˆ(X) 6= 0,
and such that the coefficients of X (in the root-vector basis) lie in the residue field
of A. It is then clear that any lift XA of X to gA (2) has the desired property.
     The main result obtained by Spaltenstein in [Spa84] implies the following:
Proposition. Assume that the root system of G is indecomposable, and moreover that
p is a good prime if R is not of type Ar , and that G = GLr+1 if R = Ar . Choose a
finite extension F of Q with ring of integers A as in the lemma; let XA ∈ vA be such that
X = Xk is a Richardson element of v and XF is a Richardson element of vF . Then
   1. cg (X) ⊂ p, and
   2. dimF cgF (XF ) = dimk cg (X).
Remark. This result was also obtained by Premet in [Pre95].
5.3. Let F be a field of characteristic 0, and let sl2 (F) be the split simple Lie algebra
over F of 2 × 2 matrices with trace 0. This Lie algebra has an F-basis X, Y, H, where
[H, X] = 2X, [H, Y ] = −2Y , and [X, Y ] = H. The semisimple element H acts
diagonally on any finite dimensional representation (ρ, M ), and the weights of H
(=eigenvalues of ρ(H)) on M are integers. Write Mi for the i-th weight space.
   The following is an easy consequence of the classification of finite dimensional
representations for sl2 (F):
Lemma. Let (ρ, M ) be a finite dimensional
                                 L            (F)-module such that all eigenvalues of
                                           sl2L
ρ(H) on M are even. Then ρ(X) : i≥0 Mi → i>0 Mi is surjective.
5.4. We can now prove the statement of theorem 1.1 for the Lie algebra.
Theorem. (p-exponent formula) Let m ≥ 1 be the minimal integer with pm ≥ n(P ).
Then the p-exponent of v is m, and the p-nilpotence degree of a Richardson element of v is
m.
Proof. In view of Lemma 4.3, we may suppose that G satisfies the hypothesis of
Proposition 5.2.
   With m as in the statement of the theorem, Proposition 4.4 shows that the p-
nilpotence degree of any element of v is ≤ m; to prove that equality holds, it
suffices to exhibit a representation (ρ, W ) of p as a p-Lie algebra in which some
ρ(X)n(P )−1 acts non-trivially. Take (ρ, W ) = (ad, p); we show that ad(X)n(P )−1 6=
0 for a suitable (and hence any) Richardson element.
                   ABELIAN UNIPOTENT SUBGROUPS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS                      13


    First, use the lemma to find a finite extension F of Q, a valuation ring A ⊂ F,
and an element XA ∈ gA (2) such that X = Xk ∈ v is Richardson, and XF ∈ vQ is
Richardson.
    The discussion in 4.4 shows that the lattice pA is 2Z graded as in 5.1 with d =
n(P ) − 1. In the notation of Lemma 5.1, we have LF = pF and L+     F = vF . Note that
ad(XA ) : pA → pA has degree 2.
    It follows from [Car93, Prop. 5.8.8] (or more precisely, the proof of that Proposi-
tion) that there are elements Y, H ∈ gQ such that H is semisimple, QY +QH +QXF
is a subalgebra isomorphic to sl2 , and such that the grading of gQ determined by
H is the same as that determined by the function f as in 4.4. Thus for each i ∈ Z
we have gQ (i) = {Z ∈ gQ | [H, Z] = iZ}. Applying Lemma 5.3 we see that
ad(XF ) : pQ → vQ is surjective, from which it follows that ad(XF ) : pF → vF is
surjective.
    Proposition 5.2(1) shows that dimk cp (X) = dimk cg (X). If we regard ad(XF )
and ad(X) as endomorphisms respectively of pF and of p, then (2) of that propo-
sition yields dimF ker ad(XF ) = dimk ker ad(X); thus we apply Lemma 5.1 to con-
clude that ad(X)n(P )−1 (p) 6= 0 as desired.

                               6. T HE   EXPONENT OF    V
   Recall that we have fixed G a reductive group in good characteristic, and P a
distinguished parabolic subgroup with Levi decomposition P = LV.
6.1. A Theorem of Springer. We recall the following important result.
Proposition. Let G be quasisimple, and assume that p is a good prime for G. If the
root system is of type A, assume that the isogeny Gsc → G is separable. Then there is
a B-equivariant isomorphism of varieties ε : u → U which extends to a G-equivariant
isomorphism of varieties ε between the nilpotent variety of g and the unipotent variety of
G.
   A version of the proposition was first proved by Springer [Spr69], though with
the slightly weaker conclusion that ε is a homeomorphism. We refer the reader to
the discussion of this result in [Hum95, 6.20/1].
   In view of the equivariance property, it is clear that ε restricts to a P -isomorphism
v → V, where v ⊂ u is the Lie algebra of V. If X ∈ v is a Richardson element, we
let R(X) denote the unipotent radical of the centralizer of X in G; note that R(X)
coincides with the centralizer in V of X.
Corollary. Assume that G satisfies the hypothesis of the proposition, and let X ∈ v be a
Richardson nilpotent element.
   1. Let Z be the center of R(X). Then Z is a connected group, and X is tangent to Z;
      i.e. X ∈ Lie(Z).
   2. The exponent of the connected, Abelian, unipotent group Z is ≥ pn where n is the
      p-nilpotence degree of X.
Proof. Put
                    w = {Y ∈ v | Ad(u)Y = Y for all u ∈ R(X)},
and
                     W = {y ∈ V | u−1 yu = y for all u ∈ R(X)}.
14                                 GEORGE J. MCNINCH


Then w is a linear subspace of v, and ε(w) = W . This shows that W is a connected
subgroup of V.
   Denoting by z the Lie algebra of Z, we have z ⊂ w since any u in R(X) central-
izes X by definition. Similarly, we have Z ⊂ W . On the other hand, if w ∈ W ,
then w−1 ε(X)w = ε(X) since ε(X) ∈ R(X); this shows that Ad(w)X = X hence
w ∈ R(X). Since w commutes with each element of R(X), we deduce that w ∈ Z
hence Z = W . This shows that Z is connected, and that dim z = dim Z = dim W =
dim w so that z = w. Since X ∈ w, we get X ∈ z and (1) follows.
   To see the second assertion of the corollary, one applies Proposition 3.6.

6.2. We can now prove the Order Formula for unipotent elements originally ob-
tained by D. Testerman in [Tes95].
Theorem. (Order Formula) Let m ≥ 1 be the minimal integer with pm ≥ n(P ), as
in Theorem 5.4. Then the exponent of the group V is pm , and the order of a Richardson
element of V is pm .
Proof. In view of Lemma 4.3, we may suppose that G satisfies the hypothesis of
Proposition 5.2 and of Proposition 6.1.
  Let Z ≤ V be as in Corollary 6.1. Then that corollary together with Theorem 5.4
imply that
                    pm ≤ exponent of Z ≤ exponent of V ≤ pm
whence equality holds.

Example. Let G be a group of type G2 , and let p ≥ 5, so that p is good for G.
There are two distinguished orbits of nilpotent (and unipotent) elements; these
are usually labelled G2 (for the regular class) and G2 (a1 ) (for the subregular class).
We choose a fixed Borel subgroup B; a Richardson element for B represents the
regular class. If P is a minimal parabolic subgroup containing B, a Richardson
element for P represents the subregular class. Moreover, P is distinguished only
if P = Pα where α is the short simple root. We have n(B) = h = 6 and n(Pα ) = 4.
A subregular unipotent element always has order p and a subregular nilpotent
element is p-nilpotent. A regular unipotent element has order p unless p = 5
in which case it has order 25; likewise, a regular nilpotent element is p-nilpotent
unless p = 5 in which case it has 5-nilpotence degree 2.
Remark. One can compute the order of an arbitrary unipotent u by finding a pair
L, Q where L ≤ G is a Levi subgroup containing u and Q is a distinguished para-
bolic subgroup of L for which u is a Richardson element. Similar remarks hold for
an arbitrary nilpotent X.

7.1. Exponentials in characteristic 0. Let F be a field of characteristic 0, and let
G be a linear algebraic group defined over F. For any nilpotent element X ∈ gF
(the F-form of g = Lie(G)) and any rational representation (ρ, V ) of G, dρ(X) is
nilpotent so one may define a homomorphism of algebraic groups
                     εX,V : Ga → GL(V ) via t 7→ exp(dρ(tX))
by the usual formula. If (ρ, V ) is defined over F, then so is εX,V .
                  ABELIAN UNIPOTENT SUBGROUPS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS                     15


Proposition. There is a unique homomorphism of algebraic groups εX : Ga → G such
that εX,V = ρ ◦ εX for all rational representations (ρ, V ) of G. The homomorphism εX is
defined over F.
Proof. Let (ρ, V ) be a faithful F-representation of G. Since the image of dεX,V is a
subalgebra of dρ(gF ) ⊂ gl(V ), one gets εX,V (Ga ) ≤ ρ(G) ≤ GL(V ) by [Bor91, Cor.
6.12]; thus we get a morphism εX : Ga → G defined over F and satisfying ρ ◦ εX =
εX,V . A second application of the result of loc. cit. shows that ρ′ ◦ εX = εX,V ′ for
any rational representation (ρ′ , V ′ ). Unicity of εX is clear.
7.2. Exponentials over integers. Let A be a Dedekind domain, with field of frac-
tions F. We suppose that F has characteristic 0. [Important examples of A for us
are: the rational integers Z, the ring of integers in a number field F, a localization
of a Dedekind domain at a prime ideal].
   Let GF denote a linear algebraic group over F, with a faithful F-representation
(ρ, V ). Fix an A-lattice L ⊂ V ; thus L is a finitely generated A-module containing
an F-basis of V . If we localize at a maximal ideal m, then Lm is a free Am module;
thus L is A-projective.
   Let J ✁ F[GL(V )] denote the ideal defining GF (more precisely: defining ρ(GF )).
The choice of A-lattice L determines the integral form A[GL(L)] ⊂ F[GL(V )]; let
JA = J ∩ A[GL(L)].
   We make the following assumption:
(1)      The A-algebra B = A[GL(L)]/JA represents a group scheme GA .
Proposition. Let HA be an affine group scheme over A such that A[HA ] is free as an A-
module. Let φ : HA → GL(L) be a homomorphism of group schemes. If the base-changed
map φF determines a morphism HF → GF , then φ determines a morphism HA → GA .
Proof. φ is determined by its comorphism φ∗ : A[GL(L)] → A[HA ]; the proposition
will follow if we show that φ∗ (JA ) = 0. Note that F[GL(VF )] ≃ A[GL(L)] ⊗A F and
F[HF ] = A[HA ] ⊗A F (the latter by definition). The comorphism φ∗F is then φ∗ ⊗ 1.
The hypothesis implies that φ∗F (J) = 0; since A[HA ] is free as an A-module, the
natural map A[HA ] → F[HF ] is injective, and it then follows that φ∗ (JA ) = 0 as
desired.
Corollary. Let X ∈ gF be nilpotent, and suppose that dρ(X) ∈ EndA (L).
 (a) Suppose that exp(dρ(X))L ⊆ L. Then the exponential homomorphism
                          t 7→ exp(dρ(tX)) : Ga,A → GL(L)
     determines a homomorphism of group schemes Ga,A → GA over A.
 (b) Let p be a rational prime, and let m ✁ A be a maximal ideal for which A/m has char-
                                        i                                        n
     acteristic p. Suppose that dρ(X)p ∈ dρ(gF ) for 0 ≤ i < n, and that dρ(X)p = 0.
     Then the Artin-Hasse exponential map (see 3.2)
                         ~t 7→ Edρ(X) (~t) : Wn,Am → GL(Lm )
      determines a homomorphism of group schemes Wn,Am → GAm over Am .
Proof. Note first that the coordinate algebras A[Ga ] and A[Wn ] are free as A mod-
ules. (a) follows immediately from the proposition combined with Proposition
7.1. For (b), Lemma 3.3(1) combined with Proposition 7.1 shows that Edρ(X) de-
termines on base change a morphism Wn,F → GF ; the result then follows from the
proposition.

7.3. Nilpotent orbits and fields of definition. If k ⊂ k ′ are two algebraically
closed fields, then an algebraic group Gk over k determines by extension of scalars
an algebraic group Gk′ over k ′ . Suppose that Gk acts on an affine variety Vk ; Gk′
also acts on Vk′ .
   The following result is attributed to P. Deligne in the introduction to G. Lusztig’s
paper “On the finiteness of the number of unipotent classes,” [Invent. Math. 34
(1976)]. A proof due to R. Guralnick can be found in [GLMS97, Prop 1.1].
Proposition. Suppose that Gk has finitely many orbits on Vk . Then Gk′ has finitely
many orbits on Vk′ , and each Gk′ orbit has a k-rational point. In particular, the number
of Gk orbits on Vk is the same as the number of Gk′ orbits on Vk′ .
   Richardson’s theorem [Hum95, Theorem 3.10] (together with case-by-case anal-
ysis for bad primes – see the discussion in loc. cit. Theorem 6.19) shows that a
reductive group has finitely many orbits on its nilpotent variety, so we obtain:
Corollary. If G is a reductive group over an algebraically closed field k, then each nilpo-
tent orbit of G in g contains a point which is rational over the algebraic closure of the prime
field in k.
Remark. When p = 0 or is sufficiently large for the reductive group G, it follows
from [SS70, Theorem III.4.29] that each nilpotent orbit has a point rational over the
prime field. We don’t need this fact.
7.4. Exponentials and Chevalley groups. We have already mentioned in 5.2 the
existence of a split reductive group scheme GZ over Z from which G arises by base
change; we now need more precise information about GZ .
   We suppose G to be a semisimple group over k. Then G is (isomorphic with) a
Chevalley group; we recall some of the ideas behind this construction (for which
the reader may find full details in [Ste68]).
   Let gQ denote a split simple Lie algebra over Q with the same root system as
G. For a suitable finite dimensional Q-representation (dρ, V ) of gQ , and a Z-lattice
L ⊂ V invariant by Kostant’s Z-form of the enveloping algebra of gQ , one “expo-
nentiates” the action of Chevalley basis elements on L to obtain Chevalley groups
with the following properties:
    • Over Q, one gets a closed subgroup GQ ≤ GL(V ) defined and split semisim-
      ple over Q. The root datum of GQ is the same as that of G. Moreover, the
      Q-Lie algebra of GQ is gQ .
    • In characteristic p > 0, one gets a closed subgroup GFp ≤ GL(L/pL), defined
      and split semisimple over Fp , which is isomorphic over k with the original
      group G.
   Since there should be no danger of confusion, we will write (ρ, V ) for the rep-
resentation of GQ on V , and (ρ, L/pL) for the representation of GFp on L/pL.
   As in 7.2, let J ✁ Q[GL(V )] be the ideal defining the Q-variety G, and put JZ =
J ∩ Z[GL(L)] (where Z[GL(L)] is regarded as a subring of Q[GL(V )] in the obvious
way). Let B be the Z-algebra Z[GL(L)]/JZ .
Lemma. The Z-algebra B represents a split semisimple group scheme GZ over Z. One
has B ⊗Z Fp = Fp [GFp ] and B ⊗Z Q = Q[GQ ], or equivalently, GQ and GFp are obtained
by base change from GZ .
Proof. This is proved in [Bor70, §3.4 and §4].

   Let now A be a Dedekind domain with field of fractions F as in 7.2. We suppose
that F is a finite extension of Q (so F is a number field). We regard F as a subfield
of a fixed algebraic closure Q of Q. Let GA be the group scheme obtained from GZ
by base change; thus GA is represented by
(1)                          B ⊗Z A = A[GL(L ⊗Z A)]/JA
[where JA is the ideal FJ ∩A[GL(LA )] with the intersection occurring in F[GL(VF )].]
    The choice of a Chevalley basis of gQ entails the choice of a triangular decompo-
sition gQ = u−Q ⊕ hQ ⊕ uQ where hQ is a maximal toral subalgebra; the construction
of GQ yields also a maximal torus TQ ≤ GQ with Lie(TQ ) = hQ . Moreover, we have
the decomposition gZ = u−  Z ⊕ hZ ⊕ uZ , where e.g. uZ is the Z-span of the Chevalley
basis elements  which  correspond  to the positive roots.
    Let φ = α>0 α∨ regarded as a cocharacter for the torus TQ . To the gQ module
            P
V , we associate the integer
                     n(V ) = max{hλ, φi | λ ∈ X ∗ (TQ ), Vλ 6= 0}.
Proposition.      1. If X ∈ gQ is nilpotent, then dρ(X)n(V )+1 = 0.
  2. Suppose X ∈ gF is nilpotent and satisfies dρ(X)LA ⊆ LA . If n(V )! is invertible in
     A (e.g. if A is local with residue field of characteristic p > n(P )), then exp(dρ(X))
     leaves LA invariant and t 7→ exp(dρ(tX)) defines a morphism of group schemes
     Ga,A → GA .
Proof. (1). We may suppose that X ∈ uQ . The co-character φ induces a grading
on VQ by Vi = {v ∈ VQ | ρ(φ(t))v = ti v ∀t ∈ Q}; evidently dρ(X) acts as a sum
of homogeneous terms of positive and even degree.  L Since the Weyl group of gQ
permutes the weights of V , it follows that VQ = −n(V )≤i≤n(V ) Vi , and (1) is then
immediate. [One can alternately argue that the graded components of VQ are the
weight spaces for the action of an sl2 -subalgebra containing a regular nilpotent
element, so that n(V ) is the highest weight. Since the regular nilpotent elements
are dense in the nilpotent variety, (1) follows; moreover, this argument shows that
dρ(X)n(V ) 6= 0 when X is regular.]
   (2) Since i! is invertible in A for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n(V ) and since dρ(X)n(V )+1 = 0
by (1), it follows that exp(dρ(X)) leaves LA invariant. The result now holds by
Corollary 7.2(a).
Corollary. Suppose that n(V ) < p and that X ∈ gk is nilpotent. Then X [p] = 0, and
the (truncated) exponential t 7→ exp(dρ(tX)) defines a morphism of algebraic groups
Ga,k → G = Gk .
Proof. In view of the results of 7.3, we may suppose that k is an algebraic closure
of the finite field Fp .
   The image of uZ in gFp is the Fp -Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a Borel
subgroup. Since k is an algebraic closure of Fp , there is a finite extension F of Q
and a valuation ring A in F whose residue field A/m = l ⊂ k has the property
that Ad(g)X ∈ ul for a suitable g ∈ G(l). Thus, we may suppose X ∈ ul . Since
ul = uA /m · uA , we may choose a lift X̃ ∈ uA of X. Since each element of uF is
nilpotent, part (1) of the previous proposition now shows that dρ(X̃)p = 0, hence
also dρ(X)p = 0 which implies X [p] = 0.
   Since n(V ) is invertible in A, part (2) of the previous proposition shows that the
exponential map determines a morphism of group schemes ε : Ga,A → GA over

A. The condition dρ(X̃)p = 0 implies that ρ ◦ ε has degree < p when regarded as
a morphism of F-varieties Ga,F = A1 → GL(V ). Denoting by ε : Ga,k → Gk the
morphism obtained by base change, it follows that also ρ ◦ ε has degree < p.
   The differential dε : F = Lie(Ga,F ) → gF satisfies dε(1) = X̃. It follows that
d(ρ ◦ e)(1) = dρ(X).
   Now, the exponential through dρ(X) is the unique homomorphism Ga,k →
GL(LA ⊗A k) with degree < p and whose differential at 1 is dρ(X). Thus, ε co-
incides with the truncated exponential, and the corollary is proved.
Remarks.     1. Suppose that G is of adjoint type (i.e. that the character group of a
     maximal torus is spanned over Z by the roots). Then G arises as a Chevalley
     group where we may take the adjoint module (ad, gQ ) for the gQ module
     (dρ, V ). In this case, one has n(gQ ) = 2h − 2 where h is the Coxeter number
     of the root system of G (see [Car93, Prop. 5.5.2]).
        The reader should compare the result of the Corollary in this case with
     [Car93, Prop. 5.5.5(iv)], where a similar conclusion is asserted, but with the
     weaker bound p > 3h − 3. We emphasize that the argument doesn’t depend
     on the Bala-Carter theorem. We have used the finiteness of nilpotent orbits
     in order to know that every nilpotent orbit has a rational point over the al-
     gebraic closure of a finite field; as noted before, in good characteristic that
     finiteness is a result of Richardson and is independent of the classification of
     nilpotent orbits.
  2. We will be most interested in applying the corollary in case G is quasisimple
     with exceptional root system. We list here some data for these root systems,
     including the minimal dimensional non-trivial gQ module Vmin . The module
     Vmin is a simple module LQ (λ) with highest λ; we describe λ in terms of the
     fundamental dominant weights with the labelling as in the tables in [Bou72,
     Planche V-IX]. Those tables may be used to compute the indicated values of
     n(Vmin ) = hλ, ϕi.
                            R    2h − 2   Vmin       n(Vmin )

                            E8     58     LQ (̟8 )   58
     3. The technique used in proof of the Theorem is similar to that used in [Tes95].
        Let Y ∈ gQ with dρ(Y ) ∈ EndZ(p) (L). We remark that [Tes95, Lemma 1.4]
        gives moreover a condition under which exp(dρ(Y )) leaves invariant the lat-
        tice L even when dρ(Y )p 6= 0. We mention also a different condition: namely,
                                         2
        (∗) if dρ(Y )p L ⊆ pL and dρ(Y )p = 0 then exp(dρ(Y )) leaves LZ(p) invariant.
        This follows from the formula for νp (i!) which may be found in [Kob77, Ch.
        I, Exerc. 13c].
            The condition dρ(Y )p L ⊆ pL means that the image Y of Y in gk is p-
        nilpotent; one may argue, as in the corollary, that under the condition (∗)
        there is a homomorphism Ga → G over k obtained by base change from
        the exponential over Z(p) . However, the homomorphism over Z(p) need not
        have degree < p; thus the map obtained by reduction modulo p need not
        coincide with the truncated exponential of Y in GL(L/pL).

7.5. Classical groups and the Artin-Hasse exponential. Let V be a Q-vector space
with a bilinear form ϕ. Let GQ be the stabilizer in SL(V ) of ϕ. We assume that one
of the following three statements holds:
CG1. ϕ = 0, so that GQ = SL(V )
CG2. ϕ is non-degenerate and alternating, so that GQ = Sp(V, ϕ),
CG3. ϕ is non-degenerate and symmetric, so that GQ = SO(V, ϕ). Moreover, if
       dimQ V is written as 2r + ǫ with ǫ ∈ {0, 1}, then V contains a totally singular
       Q-subspace of dimension r (so ϕ has maximal Witt index, or is a split form).
In each case, GQ is a connected, quasisimple Q-split group.
   The Lie algebra gQ of GQ is split simple, and we may carry out the “Chevalley
group” constructions of 7.4 for gQ with respect to its natural representation (ν, V ).
Fix a lattice L ⊂ V invariant by UZ . Over Q, the group constructed in this way
identifies with the original group GQ ; this follows from [Ree57]. For each prime p,
we get also a quasisimple Fp -split algebraic group GFp with the same root datum
as GQ .
   The formal character of the GFp -representation (ν, L/pL) coincides with the for-
mal character of the GQ -representation (ν, V ); moreover, it is well known that GFp
has an irreducible representation with that formal character (provided p 6= 2 in
case CG3 with ǫ = 1). Thus L/pL is irreducible for GFp (with this restriction on p).
   Replacing ϕ by a suitable integral multiple, we may suppose in case CG2 or
CG3 that ϕ(L, L) = Z; note that the group GQ and Lie algebra gQ are unchanged
by this replacement. For each prime p (with the restriction on p of the previous
paragraph), ϕ induces a non-0 bilinear form ϕ on L/pL; since that module is irre-
ducible, ϕ must be non-degenerate. It then follows from [Ree57] that GFp coincides
with the stabilizer in SL(L/pL) of ϕ so long as p 6= 2 in case CG3 (for either value
of ǫ).
   Let B = Z[GL(L)]/JZ as in 7.4. Then B represents a group scheme over Z, and
for each prime integer p, it follows from Lemma 7.4 that B ⊗Z Fp is the coordinate
ring of GFp .
Lemma. Let n be a positive integer, and suppose that n is odd in case (ii) or (iii). Let F be
an extension field of Q. If X ∈ gF , then dν(X)n ∈ dν(gF ).
Proof. We have for each v, w ∈ VF :
                        ϕ(dν(X)n v, w) = (−1)n ϕ(v, dν(X)n w),
whence the result.
   We now deduce in this case a recent result of R. Proud:
Proposition. Suppose that p is good for Gk (i.e. that p 6= 2 in case CG2 or CG3). For
each nilpotent X ∈ g with p-nilpotence degree n, the Artin-Hasse exponential defines an
injective morphism of algebraic groups EX : Wn → Gk . Thus each unipotent element of
G lies in a closed subgroup isomorphic with some Wn . If l is a subfield of k and X ∈ gl
then EX is defined over l.
Proof. Using the results of 7.3, we may suppose that k is an algebraic closure of the
finite field Fp . As in the proof of Corollary 7.4, we may find a number field F with
valuation ring A and residue field l = A/m for which X lies in ul (where uZ is the
Z-span of suitable Chevalley basis elements, as before). Thus we may choose a lift
X̃ ∈ uA of X ∈ ul = uA /muA .

    Corollary 7.2(b) now yields a homomorphism of group schemes EX̃ : Wm,A →
GA given by the Artin-Hasse exponential, where m ≥ n is the nilpotence degree
of dν(X̃).
    We get then by base change a homomorphism Wm,k → Gk over k; note that
by the formula defining EX̃ in 3.3, this base-changed homomorphism vanishes
on the subgroup K = {(0, . . . , 0, tn , . . . , tm−1 )} ≤ Wm,k , and coincides with the
homomorphism Edν(X) : Wm,k /K = Wn,k → GL(V ). It follows that Edν(X) takes
values in Gk (hence has rights to be called EX ), and is injective, as claimed.
    It is clear that the partition of dim V determined by the Jordan block sizes of the
unipotent element ν(EX (1)) on the natural module V is the same as the partition
of dν(X). In the cases CG1, CG2 and CG3 with ǫ = 1, the unipotent classes of G
and nilpotent classes of g are classified by these partitions (see [Hum95, 7.11]), so
we get the claim on unipotent elements in these cases. In case CG3 with dim V
even, let G′ = O(L ⊗A k) denote the full orthogonal group; thus G is the identity
component of G′ , and has index 2. The unipotent elements of G′ all lie in G, and
Lie(G) = Lie(G′ ). Again by [Hum95, 7.11], the unipotent and nilpotent classes of
G′ are classified by partition, so it is clear that each unipotent element of G′ lies in
a suitable Witt-vector subgroup. But any such subgroup, being connected, must
lie in G.
    The rationality assertion is clear.

   R. Proud has proved the proposition for all quasisimple groups G, not only
classical groups; see [Pro]. His techniques for classical G are different from those
used here.

                8. T HE   EXPONENTIAL ISOMORPHISM FOR        p ≥ n(P )
   We describe in this section an argument due to Serre [Ser96, §2.2] that will be
used below. This argument is also used in some recent work of Gary Seitz [Sei00,
§5].
   Suppose BZ is a Borel subgroup of the split reductive group GZ over Z, and let
B ≤ G be the corresponding groups over k. For α ∈ R, let φα be an isomorphism
over Z between Ga and the root subgroup Uα ≤ B.
   Any standard parabolic subgroup B ≤ P ≤ G is defined over      QZ. If V denotes
the unipotent radical of P , then the φα define an isomorphism α∈R\RI Uα,Z →
VZ of schemes over Z (where I ⊆ S defines the parabolic subgroup P as in 4.3).
Q any Z-algebra Λ, a point u of V over Z may thus be written uniquely as u =
For
   α∈R\RI φα (tα ) with tα ∈ Λ; thus the tα form a system of coordinates for V over
Z.
   The Lie algebra vZ is the Z-span of the eα = dφα (1) for α ∈ R+ \ RI+ . The
nilpotence degree n = n(P ) of VQ (and of vQ ) is given by the formula in 4.4; we
will work with the ring A = Z[1/(n − 1)!].
   Proposition 7.1 implies that the exponential map defines a morphism of vari-
eties ε : vQ → VQ over Q. Similarly, the logarithm yields a morphism of varieties
VQ → vQ , so that ε is an isomorphism.
                                    P For each Q-algebra Λ, each Λ-point u of V
may be written uniquely as u = ε( α∈R\RI uα eα ) for uα ∈ Λ. Thus the uα form a
system of coordinates for V over Q.
   Since vQ is a nilpotent Lie algebra, it may be regarded as an algebraic group
over Q via the Hausdorff series (compare [Ser96, 2.2] for the case P = B, and see
                   ABELIAN UNIPOTENT SUBGROUPS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS                   21


[Bou89, Ch. 2, §6]). Moreover, it follows from [Bou89, ch. 2 §6.4 Theorem 2] that
the operation in vQ is defined over A, so that vA is an affine group scheme over A.
Theorem. The exponential map ε defines a PA -equivariant isomorphism of group schemes
vA → VA .
Proof. The essential point is proved in [Ser96, §2.2, Prop. 1] for P = B; the gener-
alization to P is immediate. One observes as in loc. cit. that
                                uα = tα + Pα ((tβ )β<α )
where Pα is a polynomial with coefficients in A = Z[1/(n − 1)!] in the tβ with
β < α. It follows that ε is an isomorphism over A (see [Ser96, §2.2, Rem. 2]). The
equivariance assertion is clear.
Example. Let G = Sp4 (Q), so that R is of type C2 , and let P = B. Recall that
R+ = {α, β, α + β, 2α + β}. It is straightforward to check that
                                                                2ab2
                                                                  
                                            ab
           ε(X) = φα (a)φβ (b)φα+β c +           φ2α+β d − bc −
                                            2                    3
for X = aeα + beβ + ceα+β + de2α+β . It is then clear that exp is an isomorphism
over A = Z[1/6] (note that h − 1 = n(B) − 1 = 3).
   If p ≥ n(P ), then the field k is an A algebra (in a unique way), and the above
result yields the following:
Corollary. Suppose that p ≥ n(P ).
  1. ε is a P -equivariant isomorphism of k-varieties v → V.
  2. If X, Y ∈ v satisfy [X, Y ] = 0, then ε(X) and ε(Y ) commute.
Proof. (1) is immediate. For (2), one must note that the condition [X, Y ] = 0 implies
that X and Y commute when v is regarded as a group by the Hausdorff series.
Remark. If p ≥ h, then ε defines an isomorphism u → U . Since ε(X)p = ε(pX) = 1
for any X ∈ u, this gives yet another proof that every unipotent u ∈ G satisfies
up = 1 when p ≥ h.

                     9. C OHOMOLOGY       OF   F ROBENIUS   KERNELS

9.1. Let H be a linear algebraic groups over the algebraically closed field k. For
d ≥ 1, denote by Hd the d-th Frobenius kernel; see [Jan87, I.9] for the a full discus-
sion. We recall some of the details: Let m✁k[H] be the ideal defining 1 in the group
                                d
H, and put md = f ∈m k[H]f p . Then Hd is the group scheme represented by the
                   P

finite dimensional k-algebra k[Hd ] = k[H]/md ; see [Jan87, I.9.6]. In particular, Hd
is an infinitesimal group scheme [Jan87, I.9.6(1)].
  (1). There is are natural bijections
       Homgs (Hd , H ′ ) ≃ Homgs (Hd , H ′ d ) ≃ HomHopf (k[H ′ d ], k[Hd ])
                                               ≃ HomHopf (Dist(Hd ), Dist(Hd ′ )),
where Homgs refers to homomorphisms of group schemes, HomHopf refers to Hopf algebra
homomorphisms, and Dist(Hd ) denotes the algebra of distributions of Hd as in [Jan87,
I.7].
22                                    GEORGE J. MCNINCH


Proof. Since all our group schemes are affine, the homomorphisms between them
may be identified with comorphisms on coordinate algebras. The first two isomor-
phisms follow from this and the fact that for any homomorphism φ : Hd → H ′ ,
the comorphism φ∗ : k[H ′ ] → k[Hd ] vanishes on m′d . Since Hd is infinitesimal,
Dist(Hd ) identifies with the dual Hopf algebra of k[Hd ] by [Jan87, I.8.4]; the last
isomorphism follows at once.

   (2). If A1 and A2 are finite dimensional Hopf algebras over k, then HomHopf (A1 , A2 )
has a natural structure of algebraic variety over k.
Proof. Since the Ai are finite dimensional, we regard X = Hom(A1 , A2 ) as a subset
of the affine space A = Homk (A1 , A2 ) of all k-linear maps. For each a, b ∈ A1 ,
the map λa,b : A → A2 given by φ 7→ φ(ab) − φ(a)φ(b) is clearly a morphism of
varieties, and the set Xa ⊂ A of all algebra homomorphisms is the intersection
of all λ−1
        a,b (0), hence is a closed subvariety. One similarly sees that the subset Xc
of all coalgebra homomorphisms is closed, and the subset Xant of all antipode
preserving linear maps is closed. Then X = Xa ∩ Xc ∩ Xant is also closed.

     (3). Hom(Hd , H ′ ) ≃ Hom(Hd , H ′ d ) has the structure of an H ′ -variety.
Proof. The variety structure is evident from the previous remarks. The above iden-
tification is compatible with the action of H ′ on itself by inner automorphisms,
and on H ′ d by the adjoint representation; this action yields the structure of H ′ -
variety.
9.2. For any linear algebraic group H over k, consider the H-variety
                                  A(d, H) = Hom(Ga,d , H)
of the previous section, where Ga,d is the d-th Frobenius kernel of the additive
group. This is the reduced variety corresponding to a certain (possibly not re-
duced) affine k-scheme A(d, H) appearing in [SFB97a, Theorem 1.5] (where it is
called Vd (H)).

9.3. Let T be a k-torus with character group X = X ∗ (T ) and co-character group
Y = X∗ (T ). Then T is obtained by base change from the Z-torus TZ defined by
Z[X].
   We now use the results of [Jan87, I.7.8] to describe the algebra of distributions.
The Z-algebra Dist(TZ ) is a free Z-module; any Z-basis H1 , . . . , Hn of Y yields a
                                                             Qn      Hi
corresponding Z-basis of Dist(TZ ): namely, all products i=1              with ni ∈ N.
                                                   P                 ni
We will say that the degree of such a product is i ni . The distributions of T arise
by base change: Dist(T ) = Dist(TZ ) ⊗Z k.
   Distributions in Dist(TZ ) are certain linear
                                             forms  in HomZ(Z[X], Z): for H ∈ Y ,

n ∈ N and λ ∈ X, we have by definition           (λ) =          .

   Let now T (with groups X , Y , etc) be a second k-torus, and suppose that
φ : T → T ′ is a morphism. The morphism φ induces maps on the character and
co-character groups: φ∗ : X ′ → X and φ∗ : Y → Y ′ . In turn, φ∗ determines a map
Z[X ′ ] → Z[X] and hence a morphism φZ : TZ → T ′ Z from which φ arises by base
change.

   Assume that (∗) φ∗ : X ′ → X is injective and has cokernel a finite group of
order prime to p. This guarantees that dim T = dim T ′ , φ is separable, and ker φ is

Lemma. Under the assumption (∗), Dist(φ) : Dist(T ) → Dist(T ′ ) is an isomorphism.
Proof. Condition (∗) yields Z-bases H1 , . . . , HnQ    of Y and H1′ , . . . , Hn′ of Y ′ and in-

where E is a Z-linear combinations of basis elements of lower degree. It follows
that Dist(φ) = Dist(φZ ) ⊗ 1k is an isomorphism, as claimed.

is a maximal torus. Moreover, (see [Jan87, II.1.14]) φ induces maps on these ten-
sor factors; it is clear from the description of φ that it induces an isomorphism
Dist(U ) → Dist(U ′ ) (with a similar statement for U − ). Thus, it suffices to show
that φ induces an isomorphism Dist(T ) → Dist(T ′ ).
   Since G and G′ are semisimple, dim T = dim T ′ ; since X ∗ (T )Q and X ∗ (T ′ )Q
are spanned over Q by the roots, the map φ∗ on character groups induced by the
homomorphism φ|T : T → T ′ is injective; since coker φ is reduced, ker φ∗ has
order prime to p. Thus, the lemma shows that Dist(φ|T ) induces an isomorphism
Dist(T ) → Dist(T ′ ), and the result follows.
  The fundamental group of a root system R is the finite group Xsc /ZR, where
Xsc is the Z-lattice with basis the fundamental dominant weights. The theorem
has the following consequence:
Corollary. Let G be a connected, semisimple group, with root system R. Denote the
simply connected cover by Gsc → G. If p does not divide the order of the fundamental
group of R, then A(d, Gsc ) ≃ A(d, G) as Gsc -varieties for each d ≥ 1.
9.4. Let H a linear algebraic group over k defined over Fp , with Lie algebra h. Let
Np (h) denote the variety of p-nilpotent elements in h. For d ≥ 1, put
(1)   Np (d, h) = {(X0 , . . . , Xd−1 ) | Xi ∈ Np (h), [Xi , Xj ] = 0 for 0 ≤ i, j < d}.
24                                   GEORGE J. MCNINCH


We regard Np (d, h) as an H-variety with the following action:
        h.(X0 , X1 , . . . , Xd−1 ) = (Ad(h)X0 , Ad(F h)X1 , . . . , Ad(F d−1 h)Xd−1 ),
where F denotes the Frobenius morphism on H.
  We have the following analogue of Theorem 9.3.
Lemma. Let G be connected, semisimple with root system R and simply connected cover
Gsc . If p does not divide the order of the fundamental group of R, there is an isomorphism
of Gsc -varieties Np (d, Lie(G)) ≃ Np (d, Lie(Gsc ) for each d ≥ 1.
Proof. This follows from the observations made in [Hum95, 0.13].
     The following result was obtained in [SFB97a, Lemma 1.7].
Proposition. Suppose that H has a faithful rational representation (ρ, V ) with the prop-
erty that exp(dρ(X)) ∈ H for each X ∈ Np (h), where exp(dρ(X)) is the (truncated)
exponential in GL(V ). Then there is an isomorphism of H-varieties Np (d, h) ≃ A(d, H).
   Actually, in loc. cit., one gets an isomorphism of schemes N p (d, h) ≃ A(d, H);
for each commutative k-algebra Λ, N p (d, h)(Λ) is the set described by (1) except
that the Xi are taken from h ⊗k Λ. To get this isomorphism of schemes, one must
make the assumption that the exponential of any p-nilpotent X ∈ h ⊗k Λ lies
in H(Λ) for each Λ. A look at the proof in [SFB97a] shows that we still get an
isomorphism of varieties with our weaker assumption.
   If (ρ, V ) satisfies the hypothesis of the lemma, we say that it is an exponential-
type representation of H.
9.5. Let now G be a connected, semisimple, algebraic group over k. Let Np =
Np (g), Np (d) = Np (d, g), and A(d) = A(d, G).
   The group G is determined up to isogeny by its root system R. Let r denote the
rank of G. When G is quasisimple, R is either of classical type (hence is one of Ar ,
Br , Cr , or Dr ), or R is of exceptional type (hence is one of E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 or G2 ).
Theorem. Let G be semisimple. Then Np (d) ≃ A(d) as G-varieties in each of the follow-
ing cases:
   1. p > 2h − 2 where h is the Coxeter number.
   2. G is quasisimple and R is of classical type, and moreover p 6= 2 if R = Br , Cr , Dr ,
      and r 6≡ −1 (mod p) if R = Ar .
   3. G is quasisimple and R is of exceptional type, and moreover p ≥ p0 where p0 is
      given in the following table:
                                    R     p0      R     p0
                                    G2    7       E6    17
                                    F4    17      E7    29
                                                  E8    59
Proof. In all three cases, the condition on p guarantees that it does not divide the
order of the fundamental group (this is well-known, and may be checked by look-
ing at the tables in [Bou72]). So it suffices by Corollary 9.3, Lemma 9.4 and Propo-
sition 9.4 to show that there is a semisimple group G′ isogenous to G, and an
exponential-type representation (ρ, V ) of G′ .
    In case (1), this follows from Corollary 7.4 together with Remark 7.4(1).
    In case (2), this follows from [SFB97a, Lemma 1.8].
                   ABELIAN UNIPOTENT SUBGROUPS OF REDUCTIVE GROUPS                        25


   In case (3), we get the result again by Corollary 7.4 together with Remark 7.4(2).


9.6. Let G be connected and reductive, and let P ≤ G be a parabolic subgroup
with unipotent radical V ≤ P and v = Lie(V). Let n(P ) be the integer defined
as in 4.4; this coincides with the nilpotence class of V and v provided p is good;
in particular, it coincides with the nilpotence class of VQ and vQ as in section 8.
The following is related to the question posed in [SFB97a, Remark 1.9] (see the
discussion in the introduction).
Theorem. Assume that n(P ) < p. Then there is an injective morphism of P -varieties
                                 ε : Np (d, v) → A(d, V).
Remark. The point of the theorem is that ε does not depend on the choice of a
faithful representation of G.
Proof. In this case, we must first work with schemes in order to know that the map
we define is a morphism.
   Recall from Corollary 8 that there is an isomorphism of group schemes ε : v →
V. Thus for each k-algebra Λ, each X ∈ v ⊗k Λ determines a homomorphism
εX : Ga,Λ → VΛ . If X      ~ = (X0 , X1 , . . . , Xd−1 ) ∈ N (d, v)(Λ), one emulates the
construction in [SFB97a, Remark 1.3] to obtain a homomorphism of group schemes
εX~ : Ga,Λ → VΛ (note that we must use here (2) of Corollary 8), and hence (by
“restriction”) a homomorphism of group schemes εX~ : Ga,d,Λ → VΛ .
   It is now easy to see that the assignment X         ~ 7→ ε ~ is functorial in Λ, hence
                                                              X
defines a morphism of schemes N (d, v) → A(d, V). We get then also a morphism
of varieties N (d, v) → A(d, V); P -equivariance follows from (1) of Corollary 8.
   To prove injectivity, we essentially copy the proof of [SFB97a, Lemma 1.7]. Sup-
pose that εX~ = εY~ . Differentiating gives then X0 = Y0 . Multiplying each homo-
morphism with ε−X0 , one sees that ε(0,X1 ,...,Xd−1 ) = ε(0,Y1 ,...,Yd−1 ) are equal. But
then ε(X1 ,...,Xd−1 ) and ε(Y1 ,...,Yd−1 ) coincide in A(d − 1, V), and the injectivity of ε
follows by induction (note that ε is an isomorphism of varieties when d = 1; see
[SFB97a, Lemma 1.6]).
9.7. Let H be a linear algebraic group over k. We recall briefly the significance
of the variety A(d, H) for the cohomology of Hd . In the papers [SFB97a] and
[SFB97b], Suslin, Friedlander and Bendel define a ring homomorphism
                            Φ : H even (Hd , k) → k[A(d, H)],
and they show that the map induced by Φ on the corresponding schemes is a
topological homeomorphism; clearly the same is still true after replacing A(d, H)
with A(d, H).
    Now consider a connected reductive group G over k. It was shown by Friedlan-
der and Parshall that for sufficiently large p, the cohomology H i (G1 , k) vanishes
for i odd, and that the even cohomology ring H even (G1 , k) may be identified with
the graded coordinate ring of N (g). See also [AJ84], where it is proved that p > h
is sufficient. The proof of this fact in loc. cit. relies on knowledge of the dimensions
of the homogeneous parts of k[N (g)]; thus it seems likely that further understand-
ing of the cohomology of Gd might benefit from some understanding of Np (d, g).
We conclude the paper with the following, in the hope that it might be useful
(compare [AJ84, 3.9]).
26                                       GEORGE J. MCNINCH


Proposition. If p is a good prime for G, there is an injective homomorphism of G-modules
                        k[Np (d, g)] → H 0 (G/B, k[Np (d, u)]).

Proof. We mimic the argument in [AJ84]. Let X = d−1          g[i] (where the exponent
                                                     L
                                                        i=0 L
[i] denotes the i-th Frobenius twist); G acts on X by α =        Ad[i] . We denote also
by α the action of G on the algebra k[X] of regular functions on X. There is a
homomorphism
                                 k[X] → H 0 (G/B, k[Np (d, u)])
obtained by mapping f ∈ k[X] to the section g 7→ α(g −1 )f
                                                                              
                                                                               |Np (d,u)
                                                                                           . The kernel is
                {f ∈ k[X] | f vanishes on α(g)Np (d, u) for all g ∈ G},
and we claim this is the vanishing ideal of Np (d, g). It suffices to see that if {Xi } is
a set of pairwise commuting nilpotent elements in g, then the Abelian Lie algebra
a which they span is contained in a Borel subalgebra; that is a consequence of the
lemma which follows.
Lemma. Suppose that p is good for G, and that G is a Borel subgroup of G with unipotent
radical U . Let a ⊂ g be an Abelian subalgebra generated by nilpotent elements. Then there
is a g ∈ G such that Ad(g)a ⊂ u = Lie(U ).
Proof. There is a central isogeny G′ → G where G′ is a direct product of a torus
and quasisimple groups satisfying the hypothesis of Proposition 5.2. This isogeny
induces a bijection (not in general an isomorphism of varieties) on the nilpotent
sets in the respective Lie algebras. Thus, we may replace G with G′ , so that we
may apply the results of [Spa84].
    The result is well known if dim a = 1. So now suppose that dim a > 1, and
let 0 6= X ∈ a. By the Theorem proved in [Spa84], there is a proper parabolic
subgroup P of G with Levi decomposition P = LV such that X ∈ v = Lie(V) and
cg (X) ⊂ p = Lie(P ) [in general, X need not be a Richardson element in v]. Thus,
we have a ⊂ cg (X) ⊂ p. Since X ∈ v, the image of a in p/v has dimension strictly
less than that of a. We obtain by induction on dim a some g ∈ L such that the image
of a in l ≃ p/np is conjugate via Ad(g) to a subalgebra of a Borel subalgebra of l.
Since L leaves v invariant, Ad(g)(a) is contained in a Borel subalgebra of p (which
is in turn a Borel subalgebra of g). Since all Borel subalgebras of g are conjugate,
we obtain the lemma.
