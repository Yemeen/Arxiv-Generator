                                                 The subject of this paper is the localization of elementary systems in the sense
                                             of Wigner. These are quantum mechanical systems whose states are all obtainable
                                             from any state by relativistic transforms and superposition. They constitute a
                                             relativistic invariant linear manifold and the corresponding wave functions satisfy
                                             relativistic invariant wave equations.
                                                 Bargmann and Wigner [BW48] realized that these wave equations can be re-
                                             placed by representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group given by these same
                                             equations. A classification of all possible representations amounts then to a clas-
                                             sification of all possible relativistic wave equations. In this way it is possible not
                                             only to construct solutions of the wave equations but also to specify their relevant
                                             invariant properties. It is natural to realize these representations in momentum
                                             space since the momenta and energies of the system, but not the coordinates, are
                                             defined by the Lorentz group as infinitesimal translations.
                                                 A priori it is not clear which localization properties do correspond to the different
                                             elementary systems, since the coordinates which appear as arguments in the coor-
                                             dinate space wave functions are not eigenvalues of the position operator conjugate
                                             to the momentum operator.
                                                 General quantum field theory in the sense of Haag, Araki and Kastler [Haa92] is
                                             primarily concerned with local operations. Thus to each open region in Minkowski
                                             space there is associated an algebra of operators acting on the underlying Hilbert
                                             space which are interpreted as physical operations or observables that can be per-
                                             formed within this region. The states of the system are then defined as positive
                                             linear functionals over these algebras. Since it is sufficient to consider only bounded
                                             operators one is led to the study of von–Neumann algebras; their properties can
                                             be analysed independently of the generating fields. By the theory of modular

von–Neumann algebras of Tomita and Takesaki [Tom67], [Tak70] it is possible to
associate operators to certain states and space time regions which contain impor-
tant features of the theory. It was first pointed out by Schroer [Sch97, Sch99] that
by knowing these modular operators for certain regions one can associate real sub-
spaces of localized wave functions in the original Wigner representation space to
space time regions in Minkowski space. These real subspaces can then be used to
construct free quantum theories. Recent work in this direction has also been done
by Brunetti, Guido and Longo [BGLa, BGLb].
    In this paper we characterize the elements of these subspaces as boundary values
of analytic functions in the sense of distribution theory which fullfill certain bound-
ary conditions and we show that these analytic functions are the Fourier–Laplace
transforms of distributions with support in the considered closed, but not necessar-
ily compact, convex regions. We restrict ourselves to the case of the massive scalar
field, but all our considerations can be carried over to arbitrary quantum fields.

        2. Representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group
   Let R4 be the four dimensional Minkowski space with coordinates x0 , x1 , x2 , x3
and metric tensor g given by g00 = 1, g11 = g22 = g33 = −1, gij = 0, i 6= j. The
group of all linear transformations which leave the quadratic form
                            (x0 )2 − (x1 )2 − (x2 )2 − (x3 )2
invariant is called the general homogeneous Lorentz group. An inhomogeneous
Lorentz transform is a transformation which consists of a homogeneous Lorentz
transform together with a translation in Minkowski space, the translation being
performed after the homogeneous Lorentz transform. The component of the unity
of the general inhomogeneous Lorentz group is denoted by P↑+ (3, 1), the proper
orthochronous inhomogeneous Lorentz group.
   According to Wigner [Wig39] the unitary irreducible representations of the in-
homogeneous Lorentz group can be classified as follows:
Theorem 1. The representations of class Ps+ are given by a positive number P =
m2 > 0 and a discrete parameter s = 0, 1/2, 1, . . . and p0 > 0. They correspond
to particles with mass m and spin s. There is also a class Ps− with p0 < 0. The
class 0+
       s contains representations which correspond to massless particles with dis-
crete helicity and there is also a class 0−
                                          s . The representations which are given by
P = 0, p0 > 0 and a positive integer Ξ constitute the classes 0+ (Ξ), 0+ (Ξ′ ) and cor-
respond to elementary systems of mass zero and continuous spin. They are single
respectively two valued. The classes 0− (Ξ), 0− (Ξ) are characterized analogously.
The remaining classes are given by the cases p = 0 and P < 0.
   Physical realizations are only known of the classes Ps+ and 0+s . They are realized
in Hilbert spaces of L2 –integrable functions ϕ(p, σ) on the pseudo–riemannian space
forms
                          Γ+           4   k           0
                                                           	
                           P = p ∈ R : p pk = P, p > 0 .

The variable σ is discrete and can assume the values −s, . . . . + s. To each Lorentz
transformation y k = Λk l xl + ak corresponds a unitary operator U (L) = T (a)d(Λ)
whose action is given by
(1)                   U (L)ϕ(p, σ) = ei{p,a} Q(p, Λ)ϕ(Λ−1 p, σ),
        LOCALIZATION OF ELEMENTARY SYSTEMS IN THE THEORY OF WIGNER                     3


where Q(p, Λ) is a unitary operator which depends on p but acts only on the variable
σ. By the continuity of the representations there is for each one–parameter group
of unitary operators U (t) an uniquely determined self adjoint operator H such that
U (t) = exp(−itH).
   In the following we will consider analytic elements of the given representations
and use them to characterize real subspaces of localized wave functions. As a
corollary of Nelson’s analytic vector theorem we have the following proposition
[RS75].
Proposition 1. A closed symmetric operator H with domain D(H) acting on a
Hilbert space H is self adjoint if and only if there is a dense set of analytic elements
in D(H). The vector–valued functions
                                              ∞
                                             X   (−iτ )n n
                     U (τ )ψ := e−iτ H ψ =              H ψ∈H
                                             n=0
                                                   n!
are then analytic in τ ∈ C for each analytic element ψ.
  The domain of the closed operator U (τ ) depends only on Im τ . Set τ = λ + i̺
and let DU (̺) be the subset of H such that (U (τ ), DU (̺)) is a closed and normal
operator. Then the following statement holds [BW75].
Proposition 2. If ϕ ∈ DU (̺) then the vector–valued function
                                        U (τ )ϕ
is strongly continuous for 0 ≤ Im τ /̺ ≤ 1 and analytic for 0 < Im τ /̺ < 1.

      3. Boundary values of analytic functions and Fourier–Laplace
                                transform
   We consider boundary values of analytic functions in the sense of distribution
theory and specify the necessary conditions for the existence of such limits. We
also state the theorems of Paley–Wiener–Schwartz and Hörmander which will be
of relevance in the ensuing sections.
   The following is a generalization of a theorem proved by Epstein [Eps66] for
boundary values of analytic functions in S ′ (R).
Theorem 2. Let Γ be an open convex cone in Rn and T = Rn + iΓ. If f (ζ)
is analytic in T and converges for Im ζ → 0 to a tempered distribution, that is
limIm ζ→0 f (. + iIm ζ) exists in S ′ (Rn ), then for each compact set M in Γ there is
an estimate
(2)                     |f (ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N ,     Im ζ ∈ M,
where |ζ| := maxj {ζj }.
Proof. We choose in Γ an open convex cone ∆ and n affine independent vectors in ∆
such that in this basis the components of each vector in Rn +i∆ have strictly positive
imaginary parts. Let f (. + iη) converge in S ′ (Rn ) to the tempered distribution u.
This means that we can choose n positive numbers 0 < γj < ∞, j = 1, . . . , n, such
that for η ∈ ∆γ := {η ∈ ∆ : 0 < ηj < γj } and any ϕ ∈ S(Rn ) the relation
                                Z
                             lim f (ξ + iη)ϕ(ξ)dξ = u(ϕ)
                           η→0
4                                      PABLO RAMACHER


holds. We set f0 = u and write this in what follows also as
                       fη (ϕ) = hf (. + iη), ϕi −→ hf0 , ϕi = f0 (ϕ).
Since ∆ can be chosen in such a way that ∆ \ {0} ⊂ Γ, we obtain a continuous map
η 7→ fη from the compactum ∆γ to S ′ (Rn ). The image of this map is also compact
and hence bounded. One can then infer the existence of a seminorm k·kk in S(Rn )
such that all fη with η ∈ ∆γ are uniformly continuous with respect to this norm,
i.e. there are is a constant C and a positive number k such that for each ϕ ∈ S(Rn )
and η ∈ ∆γ the inequality
                                   X
                                         sup xα ∂ β ϕ(x) = C kϕkk
                                                        
(3)                 |hfη , ϕi| ≤ C
                                                  x
                                     |α|, |β|≤k

is fulfilled. In this way the distributions fη can be extended to linear functionals
on the Banach space whose topology is induced by the seminorm k·kk . So the fη
                                        k
can be considered as elements of S ′ (Rn ).
   Since f is an analytic function in Tγ = Rn + i∆γ , f (ζ)/ nj=1 (ζj + i)−k is also
                                                                     Q

analytic in Tγ = Rn + i∆γ and by Cauchy’s integral formula we obtain for f (ζ) the
representation
               Qn            k Z
                 j=1 (ζj + i)                f (z1 , . . . , zn )
                                      Z
                                 · · · Qn                           dz1 · · · dzn ,
                   (2πi)n                 j=1 (zj − ζj )(zj + i)
                                                                  k
                               κ1      κn

where each κj is a closed path in the strip Ωj = {zj ∈ C : 0 < Im zj < γj } around
ζj respectively. This representation is independent of the chosen paths and we
may thus take them as borders of the rectangles [−x1j , x1j ] × [yj1 , yj2 ], x1j > 0, 0 <
yj1 < yj2 < γi . If we now let the rectangles approach the strips in which they are
contained, the integrals along the borders [yj1 , yj2 ] disappear and we obtain for f (ζ)
the expression
       Qn             k X    Z∞
          j=1 (ζj + i)                        f (x + iθ)
                          ±     Qn                                      dx1 · · · dxn
            (2πi)n                 j=1 (xj + iθ j − ζj )(xj + iθj + i)
                                                                      k
                          θ   −∞

where θ = (θ1 , . . . , θn ) and the θj are equal to yj1 or equal to γj respectively and
the sign in the sum over θ depends on the orientation of the corresponding borders.
We put
                                 Yn
                     Φζ,θ (x) =     (xj + iθj − ζj )−1 (xj + iθj + i)−k .
                                j=1

The functions Φζ,θ as well as their derivatives up to order ≤ k decrease at infinity
faster than any polynomial xα , |α| ≤ k. On the other hand θ 7→ Φζ,θ is a continuous
map for θj 6= ηj = Im ζj into the Banach space S k (Rn ) and Φζ,θ remains in a
compact set for θ → 0 and fixed ηj . For θ → 0 we have therefore
                                    hfθ , Φζ,θ i → hf0 , Φζ,0 i .
We obtain for f in Tγ the expression
                              Qn           k X
                               j+1 (ζj + i)
                      f (ζ) =                  ± hfθ , Φζ,θ i ,
                                 (2πi)n
                                                       θ

where θ = (θ1 , . . . , θn ) is equal to γ or zero.

The θj are equal zero or equal γj and we have 0 < Im ζj < γj . Since ∆ and the
numbers γj are arbitrary, we obtain for each compact M in Γ an estimate of the
form
                              |f (ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N ,                 Im ζ ∈ M,
for a positive integer N and a constant C.
   It can be shown that the given conditions, especially relations (4) and (5), are
also sufficient.
   The Fourier transform is an isomorphism of S, so that the Fourier transform of
a tempered Distribution u ∈ S ′ (Rn ) can be defined as
                                      û(ϕ) = u(ϕ̂),               ϕ ∈ S.
For distributions with compact support the Fourier transform is given by the entire
analytic function
                                û(ζ) = ux (e−ihx,ζi ).               ζ ∈ Cn .
It is called the Fourier–Laplace transform of u.
   For each closed convex set E we define now the convex, positively homogeneous
function
(6)                              HE (ξ) := sup hx, ξi ,               ξ ∈ Rn .
                                                    x∈E

with values in (−∞, ∞]. It characterizes the set E completely, since E is given
as the set of all x ∈ Rn for which hx.ξi ≤ HE (ξ), ξ ∈ Rn . Conversely, if H is a
function with the mentioned properties, there exists exactly one closed convex set
E such that H = HE and E = {x : hx, ξi ≤ H(ξ), ξ ∈ Rn }. If E is compact then
HE (ξ) < ∞ for each ξ.

   We state now the theorems of Paley–Wiener–Schwartz [Sch51] and Hörmander
[Hör83].
Theorem 3. Let K be a compact convex set in Rn with support function HK . If
u is a distribution of order N with support contained in K, then
(7)                  |û(ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N eHK (Imζ) ,     ζ ∈ Cn .
Conversely, every entire analytic function in Cn which satisfies the relation (7) for
some N is the Fourier–Laplace transform of a distribution with support in K.
  It turns out that it is possible to define the Fourier–Laplace transform at least
on certain subspaces of Cn for more general distributions. So for ζ ∈ Cn and fixed
η = Im ζ
                                        D            E
                                û(ζ) = u, e−ih. ,ζi

could be defined as a distribution in ξ = Re ζ if eh.,ηi u ∈ S ′ . We set
                                 n                       o
(8)                        Γu = η ∈ Rn : eh. ,ηi u ∈ S ′ .

Then the following theorem holds.
Theorem 4. If u ∈ D′ (Rn ), (8) defines a convex set Γu . If its interior Γ◦u is not
empty, there exists a function û analytic in Rn +iΓ◦u such that the Fourier transform
of eh.,ηi u is given by û(. + iη) for all η ∈ Γ◦u . For each compact set M ⊂ Γ◦u there
is an estimate
(9)                     |û(ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N ,      Im ζ ∈ M.
Conversely, if Γ is an open convex set in Rn and U an analytic function in Rn + iΓ
which fulfills an estimate of the form (9) for every compact set M in Γ, then there
is a distribution u such that eh.,ηi u ∈ S ′ with Fourier transform U (· + iη) for all
η ∈ Γ.
   If in addition supp u ⊂ K, then
(10)                      |û(ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N eHK (Im ζ−η) ,
if η ∈ M , HK (Im ζ − η) < ∞, where M is a compact set in Γ◦u . If conversely there
is an η for which (10) holds, then supp u ⊂ K if K is closed and convex.

                4. Localization for the massive scalar field
   Algebraic quantum field theory is concerned with von Neumann algebras M(O)
of observables localized in space time domains O together with states ω on these
algebras satisfying certain selection criteria. Due to the Reeh–Schlieder property of
the vacuum one may associate with certain regions O and states ω the operators δ
and j of the modular theory of Tomita and Takesaki. Here δ is a positive operator
which generates a one parameter group of automorphisms ad δ it of M(O) and j is
an antiunitary operator that defines the conjugation ad j which maps M(O) onto its
commutant in the Hilbert space associated with ω by the Gelfand–Neumann-Segal
construction.
   Important features of the theory are contained in these operators but explicit
realizations of them are only known for certain regions, ω being the vacuum state.
So in the case where O is a spacelike wedge and the local algebras are generated
       LOCALIZATION OF ELEMENTARY SYSTEMS IN THE THEORY OF WIGNER                        7


by Wightman fields that transform covariantly under a finite dimensional represen-
tation of the Lorentz group the modular group is the group of velocity transforms
that leave the wedge invariant, and the conjugation is the P CT operation combined
with a rotation.
   With the knowledge of these modular objects for wedge like regions we associate,
following Schroer [Sch97], to certain closed and convex sets in Minkowski space
which arise out of the intersection of wedges real subspaces of wave functions in
Wigner representation space. These wave functions can then be viewed as localized
in the corresponding regions.
   We characterize the elements of these subspaces as boundary values of analytic
functions on three–dimensional complex submanifolds of complex Minkowski space
which satisfy certain boundary conditions and show that the latter can be analyti-
cally continued to open regions in Minkowski space. They converge in the sense of
distribution theory to square–integrable functions and we show that they satisfy the
sufficient conditions of the theorems of Paley–Wiener–Schwartz and Hörmander.
   In the following we will restrict ourselves to the massive scalar field. This field
corresponds to the representations of class P+0 of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group
P↑+ (3, 1). The wave functions have only one component and the unitary operator
Q(p, Λ) in equation (1) is equal to 1. In this case the wave equation reduces to
pk pk = P . To each Lorentz transformation y k = Λkl xl + ak corresponds a unitary
operator U (L) = T (a)d(Λ) whose action on any ϕ ∈ L2 (Γ+  P ) is given by

(11)                          U (L)ϕ(p) = ei{p,a} ϕ(Λ−1 p),
while the P CT transformation is realized by the antiunitary operator
                                       Θϕ(p) = ϕ̄(p).
                                                                          	
    We consider now in Minkowski space the region W := x ∈ R4 : x3 > x0  . W is
                                                          

open and convex as well as invariant under velocity transformations in x3 – direction,
under rotations around the x3 – axis and under translations in direction of x1 and
x2 . All these transformations constitute a subgroup of isometric isomorphisms of
W in P↑+ (3, 1). The velocity transforms in x3 – direction
                                        y k = Λk l (t)xl
are given in their active form in    the coordinates x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 by the matrices
                                                   

                           0        1 0       0    
                                                    ,
                                                               t ∈ R.
                           0        0 1       0    
                        − sinh t     0 0 cosh t

By transformation with elements L = (a, I) of P↑+ (3, 1) we obtain from W open
convex regions WL to which correspond again certain subgroups of isometric auto-
morphisms. The corresponding velocity transformations
             y k = I k l Λl m (t)(I −1 )m n xn + (δnk − I k l Λl m (t)(I −1 )m n )an
constitute a one–parameter abelian subgroup to which we associate the one–parame-
ter group of unitary operators

                                                                        ˜ −1 T (a)−1 .

Finally, each L defines the antiunitary involution
(13)                        ˜ Υ̃)Θd(I)
               jL := T (a)d(I)d(    ˜ −1 T (a)−1 = T (1 + IΥI −1 )a)d(I˜Υ̃I˜−1 )Θ,

where Υ denotes a rotation by π around the x3 –axis.
   Following Bisognano and Wichmann [BW75] we consider the analytic continua-
tion of the operators UL (t) and define the closed operators
         1/2                                             1/2
       (δL,+ , D+ ) := (UL (iπ), DUL (π)),         (δL,− , D− ) := (UL (−iπ), DUL (−π)).
Together with the involution jL they define the antilinear closed operators
                                     1/2                                         1/2
                (sL,+ , D+ ) := (jL δL,+ , D+ ),         (sL,− , D− ) := (jL δL,− , D− ).
   They are then the modular operators corresponding to the region WL . We
consider now in Minkowski space a closed polyhedral region K with vertices ai ,
i = 1, . . . , n, which arises out of the intersection of the family
                                        

the intersection over the family W L L∈XK is to be understood as the intersection
of all the regions W L which contain K.

write each ζ in MK,a i

where the Λi (τi ) are complex velocity transforms in xi –direction with 0 ≤ Im τi ≤
π, i = 1, 2, 3, and p0 is a fixed point in Γ+    P . We can thus interpret the functions
u+,ai (ζ) as functions of τ = (τ1 , τ2 , τ3 ) and write u+,ai (ζ) = u+,ai (τ1 , τ2 , τ3 ). Since
every complex velocity transform can be obtained from any other by adjoining the
latter with a homogeneous Lorentz transform, the analycity of the u+,ai follows by
Proposition 1.

considerations hold in the case that ϕ ∈ HK,− . Hence we have the following
proposition.
Proposition 3. Let an irreducible representation of the inhomogeneous Lorentz
group P(3, 1) of class P0+ be given in the Hilbert space L2 (Γ+               2
                                                                      P ) of L –integrable

functions on ΓP . The subspaces HK,±          associated to the polyhedral region K with
vertices ai , i = 1, . . . , n, are then given by the set of all functions ϕ(p) ∈ L2 (Γ+
                                                                                       P)
                                                                                +
which are boundary values of analytic functions u+,ai resp. u−,ai , in MK,a        i
                                                                                     resp.

                           P , and (ai , I) ∈ {ai } × XK,ai ⊂ XK respectively.

   By the second theorem of Cartan every holomorphic function on a closed analytic
submanifold of a Steinian manifold X is the restriction of a holomorphic function
                                                                              +
defined on X [GR65]. Therefore everyu+,ai can be extended analytically to TK,a   i
                                              +
respectively. Since the holomorphic hull of TK,ai is given by its convex hull, we
have the following lemma.
                                                      +
Lemma 2. u+,ai can be analytically extended to convh TK,a i
                                                            .
   We consider now the operator R(Λ)ϕ(p) = ϕ(Λ−1 p) and set
                                 RI (t) := R(IΛ−1 (t)I −1 ).
By definition we have
                    UL (t)ϕ(p) = ei{p,a} e−i{IΛ         (t)I −1 p,a}
                                                   −1
                                                                       RI (t)ϕ(p).
If ϕ ∈ DR (π) we define the function
(19)              r+ (ζ) := RI (τ )ϕ(p),    (a, I) ∈ XK ,         0 ≤ Im τ ≤ π.

In a similar way as before for the functions u+,ai we have the following lemma.
Lemma 3. r+ is holomorphic on the complex manifold
        n                                                                     o
              (c)
 MK,+ := ζ ∈ ΓP : ζ = IΛ(τ )−1 I −1 p, p ∈ Γ+                               ◦
                                            P , 0 < Im τ < π, L = (a, I) ∈ XK

and can analytically be extended to convh TK+ , where
                Γ+             4        ′             ◦ ′   +
                                                             	
                  K := η ∈ R : η = Iη , (a, I) ∈ XK , η ∈ Γ     .
                                                                         (c)
     As before we can represent each element ζ of MK,+ = ΓP ∩ TK+ as
                       ζ = IΛ−1 (τI )I −1 p = Λ1−1 (τ1 )Λ−1      −1
                                                         2 (τ2 )Λ3 (τ3 )p0 ,

where Λi (τi ) are complex velocity transformations in xi direction with 0 ≤ Im τi ≤
π, i = 1, 2, 3, and p0 a fixed point in Γ+P . We can therefore interpret r+ (ζ) as a
function of τ = (τ1 , τ2 , τ3 ) and write
                                      r+ (ζ) = r+ (τ1 , τ2 , τ3 ) =
                     = R(Λ3 (τ3 ))R(Λ2 (τ2 ))R(Λ1 (τ1 ))ϕ(p0 ) = RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (τ ).

Proposition 4. r+ satisfies in convh TK+ an estimate of the form
(20)                         |r+ (ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N ,          Im ζ ∈ H,
where H is a compact set in convh Γ+
                                   K.

Proof. The element RI (τI )ϕ(.)in L2 (Γ+
                                       P ) is a tempered distribution
                            RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (τ )ϕ(.) = RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (. + i̺)ϕ(p0 )
which depends on the parameters ̺ = (̺1 , ̺2 , ϕ3 ); for Φ ∈ S(Γ+
                                                                P ) we have thus
                                        hRΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (i̺)ϕ, Φi =
             Z   ∞
         =           RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (λ′ + i̺)ϕ(p0 )Φ(Λ−1     ′   −1 ′    −1 ′          ′
                                                    1 (λ1 )Λ2 (λ2 )Λ3 (λ3 )p0 ) dλ =
             −∞
                                   Z
                                 =      RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (i̺)ϕ(p)Φ(p) dM
                                      Γ+
                                       P
                                       
where ∂(p1 , p2 , p3 )/∂(λ1 , λ2 , λ3 ) = p0 . Now RI (τI )ϕ = RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (τ )ϕ is strongly
continuous for 0 ≤ Im τI ≤ π as well as for corresponding values of τi , i = 1, 2, 3;
in particular we obtain
                             kRΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (τ )ϕ − ϕk → 0        for τ → 0;
since strong convergence implies weak convergence we have for all elements ψ of
L2 (Γ+
     P)
                           (RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (τ )ϕ, ψ) → (ϕ, ψ) for          τ → 0.
Hence it follows that
                                 Z
                           lim        RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (i̺)ϕ(p)Φ(p) dM = ϕ(Φ),
                           ̺→0   Γ+
                                  P

and by Theorem 2 we obtain for r+ (ζ) = RΛ3 Λ2 Λ1 (τ )ϕ(p0 ) in MK,+ an estimate of
the form
(21)                         |r+ (ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N ,          Im ζ ∈ H,

where H is a compact set in Im MK,+ . Continuing r+ ≡ r+ (ζ i ), ζ i ≡ τi , ζ 4 =
µ(ζ) − P , analytically to convh TK+ in such a way that r+ also has a bound of the
given form with respect to ζ 4 we obtain for r+ in all convh TK+ an estimate of the
form (21) where H is now a compact set in convh Γ+  K.

For all functions u+,ai the relation
                                                                                     +

holds and we obtain with (20) the estimates
                    |u+,ai (ζ)| = e{Im ζ,ai } |r+ (ζ)| ≤
                                                       (1,3)

                                                                          ,    Im ζ ∈ H,
for each compact set H in convh Γ+
                                 K,ai and all ai , i = 1, . . . , n. We reformulate this
and summarize the above results in the following theorem.
Theorem 5. Let K be a polyhedral region in R4 with vertices ai , i = 1, . . . , n,
         R          R
and ϕ ∈ HK,+ resp. HK,− the boundary value of the functions u+,ai resp. u−,ai
             +              (c)        −             −            (c)

                                                           . Then u+,ai and u−,ai
                                     i
                                       +                  −

                                             resp. convh TK,a i
                                                                and satisfy for each

             |u±,ai (ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N eHK           (Im ζ−η)
                                                                 ,            ζ ∈ convh TK,a i
                                                                                               ,
                  (1,3)
if η ∈ H and HK           (Im ζ − η) < ∞.
   Thus the functions u+,ai and u+,ai satisfy the sufficient conditions of Theorem
4. If in addition K is compact we have the following theorem.
Theorem 6. Let K a compact polyhedral region in R4 and ϕ ∈ HK,+   R            R

Then ϕ is the boundary value of an entire analytic function u(ζ) which satisfies an
estimate of the form
                                                     (1,3)
                      |u(ζ)| ≤ C(1 + |ζ|)N eHK               (Im ζ)
                                                                      ,        ζ ∈ C4 .
                                               R           R
   According to Theorem 3 the elements of HK,+     resp. HK,−  are then boundary
values of Fourier–Laplace transforms of distributions with support in K.
