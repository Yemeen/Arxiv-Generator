                                                Symmetric functions have been playing an important role in relating combina-
                                             torics and representation theory of Lie groups/algebras. Interesting combinatorial
                                             identities involving symmetric functions, more often than not, have remarkable
                                             underlying representation-theoretic explanation. As an example consider the clas-
                                             sical Cauchy identity
                                                               Y       1           X
                                             (1.1)                               =   sλ (x1 , x2 , · · · )sλ (y1 , y2 , · · · ),
                                                               i,j
                                                                   (1 − xi y j )   λ

                                             where x1 , x2 , · · · and y1 , y2 , · · · are indeterminates, and sλ (x1 , x2 , · · · ) stands for
                                             the Schur function associated to the partition λ. Here the summation of λ above is
                                             over all partitions. Now the underlying representation-theoretic interpretation of
                                             (1.1) is of course the so-called (GL, GL) Howe duality [H1] [H2]. Namely, let Cm
                                             and Cn be the m- and n-dimensional complex vector spaces, respectively. We have
                                             an action of the respective general linear groups GLm and GLn on Cm and Cn .
                                             This induces a joint action of GLm × GLn on Cm ⊗ Cn , which in turn induces an
                                             action on the symmetric tensor S(Cm ⊗ Cn ). As partitions of appropriate length
                                             may be regarded as highest weights of irreducible representations of a general

linear group, (1.1) simply gives an identity of characters of the decomposition of
S(Cm ⊗ Cn ) with respect to this joint action.
   It was observed in [BR] that a generalization of Schur functions, the so-called
the hook Schur functions (see (3.1) for definition), play a similar role in the
representation theory of a certain class of finite-dimensional irreducible mod-
ules over the general linear Lie superalgebra. To be more precise, consider the
general linear Lie superalgebra glm|n acting on the complex superspace Cm|n of
(super)dimension (m|n). We may consider its induced action on the k-th ten-
              k
                             Nk m|n
sor power TL    (Cm|n ) =         (C ). It turns out [BR] that the tensor algebra
                 ∞
T (Cm|n ) =      k=0 T k
                         (C m|n
                                )  is completely reducible as a glm|n -module and the
characters of the irreducible representations appearing in this decomposition are
given by hook Schur functions associated to partitions lying in a certain hook
whose shape is determined by the integers m and n. Now, as in the classical
case, one may consider the joint action of two general linear Lie superalgebras
glm|n × glp|q on the symmetric tensor S(Cm|n ⊗ Cp|q ). This action again is com-
pletely reducible and its decomposition with respect to the joint action, in a sim-
ilar fashion, gives rise to a combinatorial identity involving hook Schur functions
[CW1]. So here we have an interplay between combinatorics and representation
theory of finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras as well. For another interplay in-
volving Schur Q-functions and the queer Lie superalgebra see [CW2]. For further
articles related to Howe duality in the Lie superalgebra settings we refer to [S1],
[S2], [N] and [OP].
   The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that symmetric functions
may play a similarly prominent role relating combinatorics and representation
theory of infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras as well. It was shown in [CW3]
that on the infinite-dimensional Fock space generated by n pairs of free bosons
and n pairs of free fermions we have a natural commuting action of the finite-
dimensional group GLn and the infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra gl          b
                                                                                  ∞|∞ of
central charge n. It can be shown [CW3] that the pair (GLn , gl         b
                                                                          ∞|∞ ) forms a
dual pair in the sense of Howe. The irreducible representations of GLn appearing
in this decomposition ranges over all rational representations, so that they are
parameterized by generalized partitions of length not exceeding n. The irreducible
representations of glb
                       ∞|∞ appearing in the same decomposition are certain quasi-
finite highest weight irreducible representations. In particular this relates rational
representations of the finite-dimensional group GLn and a certain class of quasi-
finite representations of the infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebra gl   b
                                                                           ∞|∞ .
   A natural question that arises is the computation of the character of these
quasi-finite highest weight irreducible representations of gl  b
                                                                 ∞|∞ . This is solved in
the present paper by combining the Howe duality of [CW3] and a combinatorial
identity involving hook Schur functions (Proposition 3.1). It turns out that the
characters of these representations can be written as an infinite sum of products of
   INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL LIE SUPERALGEBRAS AND HOOK SCHUR FUNCTIONS                 3

two hook Schur functions. Each coefficient of these products can be determined
by decomposing a certain tensor product of two finite-dimensional irreducible
representations of GLn . The same method applied to the classical Lie algebra
 ˆ (using Lemma 3.1 now together with the dual Cauchy identity instead of
gl ∞
                                                        ˆ involving Schur functions
Proposition 3.1) gives rise to a character formula for gl ∞
instead of hook Schur functions. This formula has been discovered earlier by Kac
and Radul [KR2] and even earlier in the simplest case by Awata, Fukuma, Matsuo
and Odake [AFMO2]. However, our approach in these classical cases appears to
be simpler. It is indeed remarkable that the same character identity obtained
in [KR2] with Schur functions replaced by hook Schur functions associated to
the same partitions gives rise to our character identity for gl b
                                                                  ∞|∞ . That is, the
coefficients remain unchanged!
   Making use of the same combinatorial identity we then proceed to compute
the corresponding q-character formula for this class of highest weight irreducible
                    b
representations of gl ∞|∞ . We remark that when computing just the q-characters
we can obtain a simpler formula, which involves a sum of just hook Schur func-
tions, instead of a product of hook Schur functions. We note that a q-character
formula in the case when the central charge is 1 has been obtained earlier by Kac
and van de Leur [KL]. Our formula in this case looks rather different from theirs,
thus giving rise to another combinatorial identity. It would be interesting to find
a purely combinatorial proof of this identity.
   We use the reduction procedure from gl    b               ˆ
                                               ∞|∞ to the gl n|n [KL] in the level 1
case to obtain a character formula for certain highest weight irreducible repre-
sentations of the affine Lie superalgebra gl  ˆ
                                                n|n at level 1. However, the Borel
subalgebra coming from the reduction procedure is different from the standard
Borel subalgebra, and hence the corresponding highest weights in general are
different. However, we show that by a sequence of odd reflections [PS] our high-
est weights may be transformed into highest weights corresponding to integrable
 ˆ -modules (in the sense of [KW]) so that we obtain a character formula for all
gl n|n
integrable highest weight gl ˆ -modules of level 1. In [KW] a character formula
                              n|n
has been obtained for level 1 integrable highest weight irreducible glˆ -modules.
                                                                        m|n
Our formula looks rather different.
   We also show that by applying our method together with [KW] the charac-
ters of all level 1 integrable representations of gl ˆ m|n , m ≥ 2, may be written
in terms of hook Schur functions as well. This seems to indicate the relevance
of these generalized symmetric functions in the representation theory of affine
superalgebras.
   As we have obtained a character formula for certain representations of gl   b ∞|∞
at arbitrary positive integral level, it is our hope that our formula may provide

some direction in finding a character formula for integrable gl n|n
 ˆ -modules, at higher positive integral levels.

   The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we collect the definitions and
notation to be used throughout. In Section 3 we first prove the combinatorial
                                                                            b ∞|∞ -
identity mentioned above and then use it to write the characters of certain gl
modules in terms of hook Schur functions. In Section 4 we calculate a q-character
formula for these modules, while in Section 5 we calculate the characters of the
                  ˆ n|n -modules. In Section 6 we compute the tensor product de-
associated affine gl
composition of two glb
                       ∞|∞ -modules. It turns out that even though such a decom-
position involves an infinite number of irreducible components, each irreducible
component appears with a finite multiplicity. This multiplicity can be computed
via the usual Littlewood-Richardson rule.

                                     2. Preliminaries
   Let Cm|n = Cm|0 ⊕ C0|n denote the m|n-dimensional superspace. Let glm|n be
the Lie superalgebra of general linear transformations on the superspace Cm|n .
Choosing a basis {e1 , · · · , em } for the even subspace Cm|0 and a basis {f1 , · · · , fn }
for the odd subspace C0|n , we may regard glm|n as (m + n) × (m + n) matrices of
the form
                                                
                                            E a
(2.1)                                              ,
                                            b e
where the complex matrices E, a, b and e are respectively m × m, m × n, n × m
and n × n. Let Xij denote the corresponding elementary matrix with 1 in the
i-th
Pm row and P     j-th column and zero elsewehre, where X = E, b, a, e. Then h =
                   n
     i=1 CE ii +   j=1 Cejj is a Cartan subalgebra of glm|n .
    It is clear that any ordering of the basis {e1 , · · · , em , f1 , · · · , fn } that preserves
the order among the even and odd basis elements themselves gives rise to a Borel
subalgebra of glm|n containing h. In particular the ordering e1 < · · · < em < f1 <
· · · < fn gives rise to the standard Borel subalgebra. In the case when m = n the
ordering f1 < e1 < f2 < e2 < · · · < fn < en gives rise to a Borel subalgebra that
we will refer to as non-standard from now on.
                                                         λ
    Fixing the standard Borel subalgebra, we let Vm|n         denote the finite-dimensional
highest weight irreducible module with highest weight λ.
    Let ǫi ∈ h∗ be defined by ǫi (Ejj ) = δij and ǫi (ejj ) = 0. Furthermore let δj
be defined by δj (Eii ) = 0 and δj (eii ) = δij . Then ǫi and δj are the fundamental
weights of glm|n .
    Let C[t, t−1 ] be the ring of Laurent polynomials in the indeterminate t. Let
 ˆ
gl                      −1
    m|n ≡ glm|n ⊗C[t, t ]+CC +Cd be the affine Lie superalgebra associated to the
Lie superalgebra glm|n . Writing A(k) for A⊗tk , A ∈ glm|n , the Lie (super)bracket
    INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL LIE SUPERALGEBRAS AND HOOK SCHUR FUNCTIONS                     5

is given by

                  [A(k), B(l)] = [A, B](k + l) + δk+l,0kStr(AB)C,
                  [d, A(k)] = kA(k),     A, B ∈ glm|n , k, l ∈ Z,

Here C is a central element, d is the scaling element and Str denote the super
trace operator of a matrix, which for a matrix of the form (2.1) takes the form
Tr(E) − Tr(e).
   A Cartan subalgebra of gl   ˆ
                                 m|n is given by ĥ = h + CC + Cd. We may extend
respectively ǫi and δj to elements ǫ̃i and δ̃j in ĥ∗ in a trivial way. Furthermore we
define Λ̃0 ∈ ĥ∗ and δ̃ ∈ ĥ∗ by Λ̃0 (h) = Λ̃0 (d) = 0, Λ̃0 (C) = 1 and δ̃(h) = δ̃(C) = 0,
δ̃(d) = 1, respectively.
   Let B ⊆ glm|n be a Borel subalgebra containing h. Then B + CC + Cd +
glm|n ⊗ tC[t] is a Borel subalgebra of gl   ˆ . We define highest weight irreducible
                                              m|n
             ˆ
modules of glm|n in the usual way. It is clear that any highest weight irreducible
 ˆ m|n -module is completely determined by an element Λ ∈ ĥ∗ . We will denote
gl
this module by L(gl ˆ , Λ).
                       m|n
   Consider now the infinite-dimensional complex superspace C∞|∞ with even ba-
sis elements labelled by integers and odd basis elements labelled half-integers.
Arranging the basis elements in strictly increasing order any linear transforma-
tion may be written as an infinite-sized square matrix with coefficients in C. This
associative algebra is naturally Z2 -graded, so that it is an associative superalge-
bra, which we denote by M̃∞|∞ . Let
                                            1
        M∞|∞ := {A = (aij ) ∈ M̃∞|∞ , i, j ∈ Z| aij = 0 for |j − i| >> 0}.
                                            2
That is, M∞|∞ consists of those matrices in M̃∞|∞ with finitely many non-zero
diagonals. We denote the corresponding Lie superalgebra by gl∞|∞. Furthermore
let us denote by eij , i, j ∈ 21 Z the elementary matrices with 1 at the i-th row and
j-th column and 0 elsewhere. Then the subalgebra generated by {eij |i, j ∈ 21 Z}
is a dense subalgebra inside gl∞|∞.
   The Lie superalgebra gl∞|∞ has a central extension (by an even central element

                              ∞|∞ has a natural 2 Z-gradation by setting degEij =
j − i, for i, j ∈ 21 Z. Thus we have the triangular decomposition
                     ˆ

where the subscripts +, 0 and − respectively denote the positive, zero-th and
negative graded components. Thus we have a notion of a highest weight Verma
module, which contains a unique irreducible quotient, which is determined by
an element Λ ∈ (gl   b      ∗                                       b
                       ∞|∞ )0 . We will denote this module by L(gl∞|∞ , Λ). Let ωs ,
s ∈ 21 Z, denote the fundamental weights of gl  b                                   1
                                                  ∞|∞ . That is, ωs (err ) = 0, r ∈ 2 Z,
and ωs (C) = 0. Furthermore let Λ0 ∈ (gl   b      ∗
                                             ∞|∞ )0 with Λ0 (err ) = 0 and Λ0 (C) = 1.
  Note that by declaring the highest weight vectors to be of degree zero, the
module L(gl b                       1
              ∞|∞ , Λ) is naturally 2 Z-graded, i.e.

               3. A Character formula for gl ∞|∞ -modules

  First we recall the notion of the hook Schur function of Berele-Regev [BR].
  Let x = {x1 , x2 , · · · } be a countable set of variables. To a partition λ of non-
negative integers we may associate the Schur function sλ (x1 , x2 , · · · ). We will
write sλ (x) for sλ (x1 , x2 , · · · ). For a partition µ ⊂ λ we let sλ/µ (x) denote the
corresponding skew Schur function. Denoting by µ′ the conjugate partition of a
partition µ the hook Schur function corresponding to a partition λ is defined by
                                              X
(3.1)                        HSλ (x; y) :=        sµ (x)sλ′ /µ′ (y),
                                         µ⊂λ

where as usual y = {y1 , y2, · · · }.
   Let λ be a partition and µ ⊆ λ. We fill the boxes in µ with entries from
the linearly ordered set {x1 < x2 < · · · } so that the resulting tableau is semi-
standard. Recall that this means that the rows are non-decreasing, while the
columns are strictly increasing. Next we fill the skew partition λ/µ with entries
from the linearly ordered set {y1 < y2 < · · · } so that it is conjugate semi-
standard, which means that the rows are strictly increasing, while its columns
are non-decreasing. We will refer to such a tableau as an (∞|∞)-semi-standard
tableau (cf. [BR]). To each such tableau T we may associate a polynomial (xy)T ,
which is obtained by taking the products of all the entries in T . Then we have
[BR]
                                             X
(3.2)                           HSλ (x; y) =   (xy)T ,

where the summation is over all (∞|∞)-semi-standard tableaux of shape λ.
  We have the following combinatorial identity involving hook Schur functions
that is crucial in the sequel.
Proposition 3.1. Let x = {x1 , x2 , · · · }, y = {y1 , y2 , · · · } be two infinite count-
able sets of variables and z = {z1 , z2 , · · · , zm } be m variables. Then
                  Y                                 X
(3.3)                (1 − xi zk )−1 (1 + yj zk ) =       HSλ (x; y)sλ(z),
                       i,j,k                        λ

where 1 ≤ i, j < ∞, 1 ≤ k ≤ m and λ is summed over all partitions λ with length
not exceeding m.
Proof. Consider the classical Cauchy identity
                Y                                  X
(3.4)              (1 − xi zk )−1 (1 − yj zk )−1 =   sλ (x, y)sλ(z),
                        i,j                              λ

where λ is summed over all partitions of length not exceeding m. Recall that for
any partition λ one has (cf. [M] (I.5.9))
                                       X
(3.5)                     sλ (x, y) =     sµ (x)sλ/µ (y).
                                         µ⊂λ

Let ω denote the involution of the ring of symmetric functions, which sends the
elementary symmetric functions to the complete symmetric functions, so that we
have ω(sλ(x)) = sλ′ (x). Now applying ω to the set of variables y in (3.4) we
obtain together with (3.5)
            Y                                XX
               (1 − xi zk )−1 (1 + yj zk ) =  ( sµ (x)sλ′ /µ′ (y))sλ (z)
               i,j,k                           λ   µ⊂λ
                                              X
                                          =        HSλ (x; y)sλ (z),
                                               λ
as required.                                                                           
   We note that Proposition 3.1 in the case when the sets of variables are all
finite sets follows from the Howe duality ([H1], [H2]) involving a general linear
Lie superalgebra and a general linear Lie algebra described in [CW1]. Since we
will need this result in the case when both algebras involved are Lie algebras later
on we will recall it here.
Proposition 3.2. [H2] The Lie algebras gld and glm with their natural actions
on S(Cd ⊗ Cm ) form a dual pair. With respect to their joint action we have the
following decomposition.
                                       X
                         S(Cd ⊗ Cm ) ∼

                                               λ

where the summation is over all partitions with length not exceeding min(l, m).

The matrices X j , for j ∈ N, are defined similarly. Namely, X j is obtained from
X −j by replacing ψi−,k by ψi+,l−k+1 and γr−,k by γr+,l−k+1.
   For 0 ≤ r ≤ l, we let Xri (i ≥ 0) denote the first r × r minor of the matrix X i
          i
and let X−r  (i < 0) denote the first r × r minor of the matrix X i .
   Consider a generalized partition λ = (λ1 , λ2 , · · · , λp ) of length not exceeding l
with
           λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λi > λi+1 = 0 = · · · = λj−1 > λj ≥ · · · ≥ λl .
   Now the irreducible rational representations of GLl are parameterized by gener-
alized partitions, hence these may be interpreted as highest weights of irreducible
representations of GLl . We denote the corresponding finite-dimensional highest
weight irreducible GLl - (or gll -) module by Vlλ . Let λ′j be the length of the j-th
column of λ. We use the convention that the first column of λ is the first column
10                         SHUN-JEN CHENG AND NGAU LAM

of the partition λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λi . The column to the right is the second
column of λ, while the column to the left of it is the zeroth column and the
column to the left of the zeroth column is the −1-st column. We also use the
convention that a non-positive column has non-positive length. As an example
consider λ = (5, 3, 2, 1, −1, −2) with l(λ) = 6. We have λ′−1 = −1, λ′0 = −2,
λ′1 = 4 etc. (see (3.6)).

  It is clear that sν (x−1 ) is just the character of the gll -module (Vlν )∗ , the module
contragredient to Vlν . Therefore we have

where the summation now is over generalized partitions of length not exceeding l.
Here the non-negative integers cλµν are of course just the multiplicity of Vlλ in the
12                             SHUN-JEN CHENG AND NGAU LAM

tensor product decomposition of Vlµ ⊗ (Vlν )∗ . This combined with (3.8) allows us
to write the character of F as

Using (3.10) together with (3.11) we can prove the following character formula.
Theorem 3.2. We have

where the summation is over all partitions µ and ν of length not exceeding
                                                                       P l and
cλµν are determined by the tensor product decomposition Vlµ ⊗ (Vlν )∗ = λ cλµν Vlλ .
Proof. The statement of the theorem would follow from the linear independence
of the Schur functions in the ring of symmetric functions, if the summation in
(3.10) and (3.11) were over partitons λ of length not exceeding l. However, here
we need to deal with summation over generalized partitions λ. This will follow
from the following lemma.                                                      
                                                                P           λ
Lemma 3.1. Let q be an indeterminate and suppose that             λ φ(q)chVl = 0,
where φλ (q) are power series in q and λ above is summed over all generalized
partitions of length not exceeding l. Then φλ (q) = 0, for all λ.
                                                                                            1
Proof. We continue to use the notation from above. We let pl = (x1 x2 · · · xl ) l
                 1            −1 1l                       −1 1l
and p1 = (x1 x−1                                                         λ
              2 ) , p2 = (x2 x3 ) , · · · , pl−1 = (xl−1 xl ) . Then chVl may be
                 l

written as
                                                Pl
                                                       λi
(3.12)                         chVlλ = pl        i=1
                                                            ρλ (p1 , · · · , pl−1),
where ρλ (p1 , · · · , pl−1 ) are Laurent polynomials in p1 , · · · , pl−1 . The Laurent poly-
nomial ρλ (p1 , · · · , pl−1 ) here is of course just the corresponding character of the
irreducible sln -module.                    P
    We need to show that if we have λ φλ (q)chVlλ = 0, then φλ (q) = 0 for all λ,
where q is some indeterminate. Using (3.12) by considering just the coefficient of
pml , m ∈ Z, we deduce that
                                 X
(3.13)                                 φλ (q)ρλ (p1 , · · · , pl−1) = 0.

                        Pl
Now it is clear that i=1 λi and ρλ (p1 , · · · , pl−1 ) uniquely determines λ. Hence
                                                   P
if we sum over generalized partitions λ with li=1 λi fixed, ρλ is summed over

inequivalent irreducible finite-dimensional sln -characters. Thus by the Weyl char-
acter formula we may write
                                                P          w(λ′ +ρ)

the sign of w ∈ W , ∆+ is a set of positive roots and ρ = 12 α∈∆+ α.
                         Q
  Multiplying (3.13) by α∈∆+ (eα/2 − e−α/2 ) and using the Weyl character for-
mula we get
                           X           X       ′
(3.14)                         φλ (q)      ew(λ +ρ) = 0.

As λ′ + ρ is a regular dominant weight, the coefficient of eλ +ρ in (3.14) above is
φλ (q). Thus φλ (q) = 0.                                                         
   We conclude this section by applying the character formula to the case of
l = 1, that is when the central charge is 1. In this case µ and ν are integers.

L(gl ∞|∞ , Λ(λ)) from Theorem 3.2. The resulting character formula will be involve
a sum of products of hook Schur functions. However we can use Proposition 3.1

Schur functions. This we will discuss below.

graded. Given a quasi-finite highest weight module V = ⊕s∈ 1 Z+ Vs , we can define

It is known [CW3] that L(gl  b ∞|∞ , Λ(λ)) is quasi-finite, so that we may compute
its q-character.
   We first introduce the Virasoro field:

     Now set d˜ = −L0 − 21 α0 , where α0 = li=1 ( n∈Z : ψ−n   +,i −,i
                                                                 ψn :). We have
                         ˜ ψ ±,i ] = nψ ±,i , [d,
                        [d,                    ˜ γ ±,i ] = rγ ±,i .

                                     P
It is clear that d˜ commutes with li=1 CEii so that we may decompose the Fock
                         P
space F into its Cd˜ + li=1 CEii -weight spaces. Let chq F denote the resulting

         ˜ = 1 we have

                chq F =                                                   (1 + xi ) .

where qr = {q 2 , q 2 , · · · }, qn = {q, q 2 , · · · }. Here the summation of µ is over all
partitions of length not exceeding 2l, and sµ (x, x−1 ) = sµ (x1 , · · · , xl , x−1           −1
                                                                                 1 , · · · , xl ).
The expression sµ (x, x−1 ) has a simple interpretation. Consider the embedding
of the Lie algebra gll into gl2l given by
                                                         

                                 A ∈ gll →                  ∈ gl2l .
                                                0 −At
The gl2l -module V2lµ has gl2l -character sµ (x1 , x2 , · · · , x2l ). We may restrict V2lµ
via the embedding above to a gll -module. Then its gll -character is given by
sµ (x, x−1 ).

   Of course the product li=1 (1 + x−1  i ) is nothing but the character of Λ (C ),
                                                                                   •   l∗

the exterior algebra of the gll -module contragredient to the standard module. We
may decompose V2lµ ⊗ Λ• (C l∗ ) as a gll -module and obtain

where λ are now generalized partitions of lengths not exceeding l and cµλ are
the multiplicities of this tensor product decomposition. Therefore we have the
corresponding character identity

Using (4.2) and (4.3) we obtain

where µ here is summed over all generalized partitions of length not exceeding l.
  On the other hand by Theorem 3.1, using the explicit formula of the joint
highest weight vectors, we see that

where h(λ) = r∈ 1 Z rΛ(λ)r . Combining (4.4) with (4.5), using Lemma 3.1, we
                  2
have thus proved the following.
Theorem 4.1.

                                                           µ

where the sum is over all partitions of length not exceeding 2l and the coefficient
cµλ are determined by (4.3).
   We consider the simplest case when l = 1 and let x = x1 . In this case it is clear
that sµ (x, x−1 ) is just the character of the corresponding sl2 -module, and hence
for a partitions µ = (µ1 , µ2 ) with µ1 ≥ µ2 ≥ 0 we have
                    sµ (x, x−1 ) = xµ1 −µ2 + xµ1 −µ2 −2 + · · · + xµ2 −µ1 .
Hence
            sµ (x, x−1 )(1 + x−1 ) = xµ1 −µ2 + xµ1 −µ2 −1 + · · · + xµ2 −µ1 −1 .
Therefore we see that for λ ∈ Z

Note that the coefficient of q , s ∈         in HSµ (qr ; qn ) can be computed as

coefficient of q s in HSµ (qr ; qn ) is the number of (∞|∞)-semi-standard tableaux

for all λ ∈ Z+ . We have a similar q-character identity for higher level represen-
tations as well. In fact one has the following proposition.
Proposition 4.1. Let l ∈ N and λ be a generalized partition of length not ex-
ceeding l. We have
           b ∞|∞ , Λ(λ1 , λ2 , · · · , λl )) =
     chq L(gl

In particular when l = 1 the above identity reduces to (4.6).
                                                                     b ∞|∞ and
Proof. We will use the Howe duality involving a B-type subalgebra of gl
the double covering Lie group Pin2l of the spin group Spin2l on F in [CW3] to
prove this identity.

  We recall that the subalgebra B is the subalgebra of gl∞|∞ preserving the even
non-degenerate bilinear form (·|·) of gl∞|∞ defined by
                        (ei |ej ) = (−1)i δi,−j ,        i, j ∈ Z,
                                              1                           1
                        (er |es ) = (−1)r+ 2 δr,−s ,          r, s ∈        + Z.
                                                                          2
Restricting the 2-cocycle of gl∞|∞ to B we obtain a central extension B    b of B.
Obviously B b acts on F and in fact there exists an action of Pin2l on F such that
 b Pin2l ) forms a dual pair [CW3]. Hence we have a multiplicity-free decompo-

two dual pairs form a seesaw pair in the sense of Kudla [KU]. This implies that
we have the following decompositions of respectively B- b and GLl -modules:

where here λ′ = λ − ( 21 , · · · , 21 ) due to the twist by det 2 and bµλ ∈ Z+ .
    Now the Pin2l -modules that appear in the decomposition of F with respect to
the dual pair (B, b Pin2l ), when regarded as a module over the Lie algebra so2l ,
decomposes into two irreducible modules contragredient to each other. Hence
                         b
bµλ = bµλ∗ . But then as B-modules        we have

                                               =                    b µ′ )
                                                             bµλ∗ L(B,

Hence as modules over B      b we have an isomorphism

   We first recall a method of constructing representations of affine superalgebras

                                         ∞|∞ [KL]. It is a generalization of the classical
                    ˆ          ˆ
reduction from gl∞ to gln . Our presentation below is somewhat different from
[KL] in flavor. P                                          P
   Let ψ + (z) =                 + −n−1
                          n∈Z ψn z        and ψ − (z) =             − −n
                                                             n∈Z ψn z     be a pair of free

fermions and let γ (z) = r∈ 1 +Z γr z                be a pair of free bosons. Let F denote
                                       2
the corresponding Fock space generated by the vacuum vector |0 >. We have thus
an action of the dual pair (gl       ˆ ∞|∞ , gl1) on F, where the central charge of glˆ ∞|∞
is 1. From the pair of free fermions we may construct n pairs of free fermions
ψ ±,i (z), for i = 1, · · · , n, as follows:

                                     X                         X
(5.1)              ψ +,i (z) =             ψk+,i z −k−1 =             +
                                                                     ψ−i+n(k+1) z −k−1 ,
                                     k∈Z                       k∈Z
                                     X                      X
(5.2)              ψ   −,i
                             (z) =         ψk−,i z −k   =          −
                                                                  ψi+n(k−1) z −k .
                                     k∈Z                    k∈Z


It is easy to check that the only non-zero commutation relations are

                                +,i
                              [ψm   , ψn−,j ] = δij δm+n,0 ,           m, n ∈ Z.

Similarly we construct from our pair of free bosons n pairs of free bosons γ ±,i (z)
for i = 1, · · · , n, via

Again it is easily checked that the only non-zero commutation relations are

                                                                               1

                                                                               2

  We may now use these n pairs of fermions and bosons to construct a copy of

  The following lemma is straightforward.
Lemma 5.1. We have
                   ˆ
        Eij (m) ∈ (gl    ∞|∞ )+ ,     for i < j with m = 0 and for m ≥ 1,
                       ˆ
            eij (m) ∈ (gl ∞|∞ )+ , for i < j with m = 0 and for m ≥ 1,
                       ˆ
            aij (m) ∈ (gl ∞|∞ )+ , for i < j with m = 0 and for m ≥ 1,
                       ˆ
            bij (m) ∈ (gl ∞|∞ )+ , for i ≤ j with m = 0 and for m ≥ 1.

   Now every representation of gl  ˆ
                                     ∞|∞ that appears in the decomposition of F is
obviously invariant under the action of gl  ˆ
                                              n|n constructed via reduction modulo
                                  ˆ
n. By [KL] every irreducible gl∞|∞ -module that appears in F in fact remains
                               ˆ . Hence it follows from the previous lemma that
irreducible when restricted to gl n|n
every irreducible representation of glˆ
                                        ∞|∞ that appears in the decomposition of F
                                 ˆ
is a highest weight irreducible gln|n -module with respect to the Borel subalgebra
induced by the non-standard Borel subalgebra of gln|n.
Remark 5.1. In general one can construct m pairs of free fermions and n pairs of
free bosons using the method just described. One then constructs a copy of the
20                              SHUN-JEN CHENG AND NGAU LAM

affine glm|n of central charge 1 in the usual way. However, the resulting repre-
sentations of this affine glm|n on the highest weight irreducible representations of
 ˆ ∞|∞ of are not highest weight representations with respect to a Borel subalgebra
gl
induced from a Borel subalgebra of glm|n .

   We want to deduce a character formula for the glˆ -module L(gl ˆ
                                                     n|n            ∞|∞ , Λ(λ))
from (3.15). For this we will need to find a slightly more general formula for
     ˆ
chL(gl  ∞|∞ , Λ(λ)).
   Set d¯ = −L0 (see (4.1)) so that we have
                     ¯ ψ ±,i ] = (k ± 1 )ψ ±,i , [d,
                    [d,                           ¯ γ ±,i ] = rγ ±,i .
                        k                            r          r
                                      2 k
From this the following lemma is a straightforward computation.
                                  ¯ X(m)] = mX(m), for X = E, e, a, b.
Lemma 5.2. For all m ∈ Z we have [d,
   By construction we see that d¯ acts on each L(gl   ˆ ∞|∞ , Λ(λ)) as a semisimple
                          ¯ (gl
linear operator and also [d,  ˆ
                                ∞|∞ )0 ] = 0. Hence we may compute the character
      ˆ
of L(gl∞|∞ , Λ(λ)) with respect to (gl ˆ           ¯                 ˆ           ¯∗
                                         ∞|∞ )0 ⊕ Cd. Letting δ ∈ ((gl ∞|∞ )0 ⊕ Cd)
              ¯ = 1 and δ((gl
defined by δ(d)              ˆ                                     −δ
                               ∞|∞ )0 ) = 0 we have (x = x1 , q = e ):

                                n                               1          −1               1

        chF =                                                              −1                    .
                                j=1
                                      (1 − xzj− 1 +(s− 1 )n q s )(1 − x−1 z−j+ 1
                                                                                 −(s− 1 )n
                                                                                           qs)

It follows again from Proposition 3.1 that with respect to (glb ∞|∞ )0 ⊕ Cd the
                ˆ
character of L(gl ∞|∞ , Λ(λ)) equals to
                         X
(5.5)                         HSµ (zq; yq)HSν (z−1 q; y−1 q),
                          µ−ν=λ
                                                                                                     1
where for k ∈ N, s ∈ 21 + Z+ and j = 1, · · · , n. Here yq = {yj+n(k−1)q k− 2 },
          −1        1                                              −1
y−1 q = {yj−nk q k− 2 }, zq = {zj− 1 +(s− 1 )n q s } and z−1 q = {z−j+ 1
                                                                         −(s− 21 )n
                                                                                    q s }.

  The following lemma follows easily from our construction.
                                                                 1

                     [Eii (0), ψk±,j ] = ±δij ψk±,j ,       [Eii (0), γr±,j ] = 0,
                     [eii (0), ψk±,j ] = 0,      [eii (0), γr±,j ] = ±δij γr±,j .

   Let us denote the scaling operator of glˆ
                                             n|n by d. It is clear from Lemma 5.2
                             ¯
that the linear operator d− d acts as a scalar on each irreducible representation of
ˆ
gl n|n that appears in the decomposition of F. The scalar can be computed from

the explicit formulas of the gl ∞|∞ highest weight vectors given by Theorem 3.1.
In the case of l = 1 the highest weight vectors are given by
                                   + λ
(5.6)                            (γ− 1 ) |0 >,              λ ≥ 0,
                                      2

                                      2

Now d¯ acts on the former with eigenvalue − λ2 and on the latter with eigenvalue

  . Thus using Lemma 5.3 we can rewrite (5.5) in the following form.
Theorem 5.1. For yq = {yj q s }, y−1 q = {yj−1q s }, zq = {zj q s } and z−1 q =
{zj−1 q s } with j = 1, · · · , n and s ∈ 21 + Z+ we have (µ, ν ∈ Z+ and λ ∈ Z)

                                                    µ−ν=λ

where yj = eǫ̃j , zj = eδ̃j and q = e−δ̃ .
Proposition 5.1. The gl ˆ -modules in Theorem 5.1 are integrable. Furthermore
                          n|n
                                        ˆ -modules of level 1.
they form a complete list of integrable gl n|n

Proof. We will employ the method of simple odd reflections [PS] following [KW].
    Recall that the set of simple roots of gl    ˆ
                                                   n|n with respect to the standard Borel
subalgebra is given by {α0 = δ̃n − ǫ̃1 + δ̃, α1 = ǫ̃1 − ǫ̃2 , α2 = ǫ̃2 − ǫ̃3 , · · · , αn =
ǫ̃n − δ̃1 , αn+1 = δ̃1 − δ̃2 , · · · , αN
                                        2n−1 = δ̃n−1 − δ̃n }. The corresponding Dynkin
diagram is as follows (as usual            denotes an isotropic odd root):
                                          α0
                                          N

   Now the set of simple roots with respect to the non-standard Borel subalgebra
are given by {β0 = ǫ̃n − δ̃1 + δ̃, β1 = δ̃1 − ǫ̃1 , β2 = ǫ̃1 − δ̃2 , β3 = δ̃2 − ǫ̃2 , · · · , β2n−2 =
ǫ̃n−1 − δ̃n , β2n−1 = δ̃n − ǫ̃n }, with the corresponding Dynkin diagram
                                        β0
                                        N

   We can use a chain of odd reflections [PS] to bring the second diagram to the
first as follows. We reflect first along the odd simple root β2n−1 . After that we
22                           SHUN-JEN CHENG AND NGAU LAM

reflect along the right most odd simple root in the bottom row of the Dynkin
diagram which is of the form δ̃i − ǫ̃j . For example, after reflecting along β2n−1 we
obtain the diagram
                                      δ̃n − δ̃1 + δ̃

                                                                ❳
                                         · · ·· · ·· · ·     
                  β1    β2       β3                          γ −β2n−1

where γ = ǫ̃n−1 − ǫ̃n . As −β2n−1 and γ are not of the form δ̃i − ǫ̃j , the next step
is to reflect along the odd simple root β2n−3 . Continuing this way we obtain the
diagram corresponding to the standard Borel subalgebra.
    Now according to Lemma 1.4 of [KW] a highest weight vector vΛ of highest
weight Λ with respect to the original Borel subalgebra remains a highest weight
vector of the new Borel subalgebra if and only if the Λ(γ̌) = 0, where γ̌ is
the simple coroot corresponding to the odd simple root γ, along which we have
reflected. Furthermore in this case the new highest weight and the original highest
weight coincide. If however Λ(γ̌) 6= 0, then e−γ v is the highest weight vector with
respect to the new Borel subalgebra, where e−γ is the root vector corresponding
to −γ. Furthermore the new highest weight is Λ − γ.
    Let 0 ≤ λ ≤ n and consider the highest weight λδ̃1 + Λ̃0 . It follows that when we
change from non-standard to the standard Borel subalgebra it gets transformed
to ǫ̃1 + · · · + ǫ̃λ + Λ̃0 . If λ > n, then the highest weight gets transformed to
ǫ̃1 + · · · + ǫ̃n + (λ − n)δ̃1 + Λ̃0 . On the other hand let λ < 0 and consider the
highest weight of the form (λ + 1)δ̃n + ǫ̃n + Λ̃0 . Changing from the non-standard
Borel to the standard Borel via the sequence of odd reflections described above
it follows that the highest weight gets transformed to λδ̃n + Λ̃0 . However, the list
of highest weights here for the standard Borel subalgeba coincides with the list
of integrable highest weights in [KW]. Thus all our modules are integrable. 

   As the Cartan subalgebras of the non-standard Borel and standard Borel sub-
algebras coincide, it follows that our character formula agree with the character
formula of [KW]. Comparing both formulas gives rise to combinatorial identities.
   Our method can also be used to obtain a character formula for integrable level 1
 ˆ -modules as follows. Consider the Fock space F generated by m pairs of free
gl m|n
fermions ψ ±,i (z), i = 1, · · · , m and n pairs of free bosons γ ±,j (z), j = 1, · · · , n.
Then F according to [KW] is completely reducible as a level 1 gl      ˆ m|n -module. To be
more precise there is an action of gl  ˆ
                                         m|n × gl1 on F and they form a dual pair. The
               ˆ
action of the gl m|n is given in the usual way,     while gl1 is generated by the charge

                                    λ∈Z

where Λ̃(λ) is given as follows:
                   
                   
                   ǫ̃1 + · · · + ǫ̃λ + Λ̃0 ,            for 0 ≤ λ ≤ m,
(5.9)     Λ̃(λ) = ǫ̃1 + · · · + ǫ̃m + (λ − m)δ̃1 + Λ̃0 , for λ > m,
                   
                   λδ̃ + Λ̃ ,
                        n       0                        for λ < 0.
We remark that (5.9) is a complete list (up to essential equivalence [KW]) of
                               ˆ
integrable highest weights for gl m|n of level 1 with m ≥ 2 [KW]. Now we can
write the character of F as
                          Y Qm (1 + xyi q s )(1 + x−1 y −1q s )
                                                           i
(5.10)           chF =         Qni=1            s       −1 −1 s ,
                           1      j=1 (1 − xzj q )(1 − x zj q )
                            s∈ 2 +Z+

where again we use the notation yi = eǫ̃i , zj = eδ̃j and x = eǫ with ǫ ∈ (gl1)∗ such
that ǫ(I) = 1. By Proposition 3.1 (5.10) can be written as (q = eδ̃ )
                 X X                                         

                     λ∈Z µ−ν=λ

where z±1 q = {zj±1 q s |j = 1, · · · , n; s ∈ 21 Z+ } and y±1 q = {yi±1q s |i = 1, · · · , m; s ∈

  Z }. Thus we have arrived at the following description of characters by Lemma 3.1.

Theorem 5.2. Let λ ∈ Z and Λ̃(λ) be the gl

           ˆ , Λ̃(λ)) = q − |λ|

                                          µ−ν=λ

where µ, ν ∈ Z+ .
Remark 5.2. We note that we can derive character formulas in an analogous
                ˆ -modules that appear in the Fock space decomposition [F]
fashion for the gl ∞
[FKRW] [KR2] (see also [W1] and [W2] for a rather elegant argument in the
spirits of Howe duality). The resulting formulas will be sums of products of
ordinary Schur functions instead of hook Schur functions. These formulas agree
with the ones obtained in [KR2] and the one in [AFMO2] in the special case
when Λ = 0. However, when dealing with the q-character formulas, we can also
produce a character involving just a sum of Schur functions.
Remark 5.3. By [KR1] the representation theory of glˆ ∞ is closely related to the
representation theory of W1+∞ , which is the limit (in an appropriate sense) of
24                        SHUN-JEN CHENG AND NGAU LAM

the W -algebras WN , as N → ∞ [PRS1] [PRS2]. In particular, quasi-finite irre-
ducible highest weight representations of latter can be constructed on a suitable
tensor product of quasi-finite irreducible highest weight representations of a cen-
tral extension of gl∞ ⊗ An , where An ∼  = C[t]/tn . Using analogous argument it
can be shown that the quasi-finite highest weight irreducible representations of
the Lie superalgebra of differential operators on the super circle, the super W1+∞
introduced in [MR] (cf. [AFMO1] and [CW3] for definition), can be realized on
a suitable tensor product of quasi-finite highest weight irreducible modules of
a central extension of gl∞|∞ ⊗ An . Furthermore each L(gl    b
                                                               ∞|∞ , Λ(λ)) carries a
structure of an irreducible representations of super W1+∞ [CW3]. In particular,
our character formula may be modified to obtain a character formula for these
quasi-finite irreducible super W1+∞ -modules.


                     6. Tensor Product Decomposition
  In this section as another application of Theorem 3.1 we will compute the
tensor product decomposition
                                                 X µν
(6.1)         ˆ
           L(gl                 ˆ              ∼       ˆ
                ∞|∞ , Λ(µ)) ⊗ L(gl ∞|∞ , Λ(ν)) =  aλ L(gl ∞|∞ , Λ(λ)),
                                                  λ


where Λ(µ) and Λ(ν) denote highest weights of gl      ˆ
                                                        ∞|∞ of level l and level r,
respectively, so that µ and ν are generalized partitions with l(µ) ≤ l and l(ν) ≤ r.
The summation λ in (6.1) is over all generalized partitions of length not exceeding
l+r and Λ(λ) is viewed as a highest weight of glˆ
                                                  ∞|∞ of level l+r. We will compute
                  µν
the coefficients aλ in terms of the usual Littlewood-Richardson coefficients (see
e.g. [M]).
   To emphasize the dependence of the Fock space F in Theorem 3.1 on the integer
l we will write F = Fl and hence Theorem 3.1 reads
                                X
                          Fl ∼
                             =        ˆ
                                    L(gl                 λ
                                         ∞|∞ , Λ(λ)) ⊗ Vl .
                                    λ

Therefore we have
                    X                                               
        F ⊗F ∼
         l
             =r             ˆ                 ˆ                 µ    ν
                          L(gl∞|∞ , Λ(µ)) ⊗ L(gl∞|∞ , Λ(ν)) ⊗ Vl ⊗ Vr .
                    µ,ν


Now Fl ⊗ Fr ∼= Fl+r and hence using Theorem 3.1 again we have
(6.2)
X                           X                                            
      ˆ ∞|∞, Λ(λ)) ⊗V λ ∼
    L(gl                  =     L( ˆ ∞|∞ , Λ(µ)) ⊗L(gl
                                   gl               ˆ ∞|∞ , Λ(ν)) ⊗ V µ ⊗V ν .
                      l+r                                            l    r
 λ                            µ,ν

                     λ
Now suppose that Vl+r   , when regarded as a gll × glr -module via the obvious
embedding of gll × glr into gll+r , decomposes as
                                      X
                               λ ∼
                             Vl+r   =    bλµν Vlµ ⊗ Vrν .
                                         µ,ν

This together with (6.1) and (6.2) give
(6.3)                                   aµν   λ
                                         λ = bµν .

  The duality between the branching coefficients and tensor products of a general
dual pair is well-known [H2]. We recall that in (6.3) µ, ν and λ are generalized
partitions subject to constraints on their lengths.
  Now Proposition 3.2 combined with an analogous argument as the one given
above imply that
(6.4)                                   ãµν   λ
                                          λ = bµν ,

where here µ, ν, λ are partitions of appropriate lengths and the ãµν          λ ’s are the
usual Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We remark that there are combinatorial
algorithms to compute these coefficients, the most well-known probably being the
celebrated Littlewood-Richardson rule (again see e.g. [M]).
   Now for generalized partitions µ, ν and λ of appropriate lengths the decompo-
         λ ∼
                 P                                       λ+d1     P
            = µ,ν bλµν Vlν ⊗ Vrµ implies that Vl+r l+r ∼
                                                                            µ+d1l
sition Vl+r                                                    = µ,ν bλµν Vl      ⊗ Vrν+d1r ,
where here 1k denotes the k-tuple (1, 1, · · · , 1) regarded as a partition. Hence
        λ+d1
bλµν = bµ+d1l+r
             l ,ν+d1r
                      . Now if we choose a non-negative integer d so that λ + d1l+r is
                        λ+d1              µ+d1l ,ν+d1r
a partition, then bµ+d1l+r   l ,ν+d1r
                                      = ãλ+d1 l+r
                                                       and hence by (6.3) and (6.4)

                                    aµν    µ+d1l ,ν+d1r
                                     λ = ãλ+d1l+r      .
  From our discussion above we arrive at the following theorem.
Theorem 6.1. Let µ and ν be generalized partitions with l(µ) ≤ l and l(ν) ≤ r
so that we may regard Λ(µ) and Λ(ν) as gl       ˆ
                                                  ∞|∞ -highest weights of level l and
r, respectively. Then we have the following decomposition of L(gl        ˆ
                                                                           ∞|∞ , Λ(µ)) ⊗
   ˆ
L(gl                  ˆ
     ∞|∞ , Λ(ν)) into gl ∞|∞ -highest weight modules of level l + r:
                                           X µ+d1 ,ν+d1
      ˆ
   L(gl     , Λ(µ)) ⊗ L(  ˆ
                          gl     , Λ(ν)) ∼    ãλ l           ˆ
                                                            L(gl ∞|∞ , Λ(λ − d1l+r )),
                                                          r
        ∞|∞                  ∞|∞         =
                                               (λ,d)

where the summation above is over all pairs (λ, d) subject to the following three
conditions:
    (i) λ is a partition of length not exceeding l + r and d a non-negative integer.
   (ii) µ + d1l and ν + d1r are partitions.
  (iii) If d > 0, then λ is a partition with λl+r = 0.
26                          SHUN-JEN CHENG AND NGAU LAM

Here the coefficients ãλµ+d1l ,ν+d1r are determined by the tensor product decompo-

sition of glk -modules Vkµ+d1l ⊗ Vkν+d1r ∼ = λ ãλ l        Vk , where k ≥ l + r.
Remark 6.1. Making use of the Howe duality between gl  ˆ and gll mentioned
                                                        ∞
earlier in Remark 5.2, one derives in a completely analogous fashion a tensor
                                      ˆ -modules that is identical to that for
product decomposition rule for these gl ∞

gl∞|∞ -modules.
