                                                    Let A be a basic and connected finite dimensional algebra over a field k of character-
                                                istic zero. We show that if the quiver of A has no double bypass then the fundamental
                                                group (as defined in [17]) of any presentation of A by quiver and relations is the quotient
                                                of the fundamental group of a privileged presentation of A. Then we show that the
                                                Galois covering of A associated with this privileged presentation satisfies a universal
                                                property with respect to the connected Galois coverings of A in a similar fashion to the
                                                universal cover of a topological space.


                                                Introduction
                                                In this text, k will be an algebraically closed field. Let A be a finite dimensional
                                                algebra over k. In order to study left A-modules we may assume that A is basic and
                                                connected, where basic means that A is the direct sum of pairwise non isomorphic
                                                indecomposable projective left A-modules. For such an algebra, the study of the Galois
                                                coverings of A gives some information on the representation theory of A (see [7], [11]
                                                and [17]) and is a particular case of the covering techniques introduced in [6], [10] and
                                                [18]. In order to manipulate coverings of A we will always consider, unless otherwise
                                                stated, A as a k-category with set of objects a complete set {ei }i of primitive pairwise
                                                orthogonal idempotents and with morphisms space ei → ej the vector space ej Aei . The
                                                covering techniques have led to the definition (see [11] and [17]) of a fundamental group
                                                associated with any presentation of A by quiver and admissible relations, and which
                                                satisfies many topological flavoured properties (see [3], [11] and [17]). This construction
                                                and its associated properties depend on the choice of a presentation of A. In particular,
                                                one can find algebras for which there exist different presentations giving rise to non
                                                isomorphic fundamental groups. In this text we compare the fundamental groups of
                                                the presentations of A as defined in [17], and we study the coverings of A with the
                                                following question in mind: does A have a universal Galois covering? i.e. does A admit
                                                a Galois covering which is factorised by any other Galois covering? This question has
                                                been successfully treated when A is representation-finite (see [6] and [10]). The present
                                                study will involve quivers “without double bypass”. In simple terms, a quiver without
                                                double bypass is a quiver which has no distinct parallel arrows, no oriented cycle and

                                                has no subquiver of the following form                  where continued (resp. dotted)
                                                arrows represent arrows (resp. oriented paths) in the quiver. Assuming that k is a
                                                characteristic zero field and that the ordinary quiver Q of A has no double bypass, we
                                                prove the following result announced in [16]:


                                                                                            1
Theorem 1. Assuming the above conditions, there exists a presentation kQ/I0 ≃ A by
quiver and relations such that for any other presentation kQ/I ≃ A the identity map
on the walks in Q induces a surjective group morphism π1 (Q, I0 ) ։ π1 (Q, I).

The proof of the above theorem allows us to recover the following fact proven in [5]:
if A is a basic triangular connected and constricted finite dimensional k-algebra, then
different presentations of A give rise to isomorphic fundamental groups. Under the
                                                                                     F0
hypotheses made before stating Theorem 1 and with the same notations, if kQ̃/I˜0 −→
kQ/I0 is the Galois covering with group π1 (Q, I0 ) induced by the universal Galois
covering of (Q, I0 ) (see [17]), we show the following result.

Theorem 2. For any connected Galois covering F : C ′ → A with group G there exist
                          ∼
an isomorphism kQ/I0 −    → A, a Galois covering p : k Q̃/I˜0 → C ′ with group a normal
subgroup N of π1 (Q, I0 ) and a commutative diagram:
                                           p
                                   kQ̃/I˜0     / C′

together with an exact sequence of groups: 1 → N → π1 (Q, I0 ) → G → 1

    Hence Theorem 2 partially answers the question concerning the existence of a univer-
sal Galois covering. The text is organised as follows: in Section 1 we define the notions
we will use, in Section 2 we prove Theorem 1, in Section 3 we give useful results on
covering functors, these results will be used in the proof of Theorem 2 to which Section
4 is devoted. Section 2 gives the proofs of all the results that were announced by the
author in [16]. This text is part of the author’s thesis made at Université Montpellier

1     Basic definitions
k-categories, covering functors, Galois coverings
A k-category is a category C such that the objects class C0 of C is a non empty set
and such that each set y Cx of morphisms x → y of C is a k-vector space with k-bilinear
composition. Let C be a k-category. We will say that C is locally bounded if the
following properties are satisfied:
    a) distinct objects are not isomorphic,
    b) for each x ∈ C0 , the k-algebra x Cx is local,
    c) ⊕y∈C0 y Cx is finite dimensional for any x ∈ C0 ,
    d) ⊕x∈C0 y Cx is finite dimensional for any y ∈ C0 .
Unless otherwise stated, all the k-categories we will introduce will be locally    Pnbounded.
As an example, let A be a basic finite dimensional k-algebra. If 1 =                 i=1 ei is a
decomposition of the unit into a sum of primitive orthogonal idempotents, then A =
⊕i,j ej Aei and A is a locally bounded k-category with set of objects {e1 , . . . , en } and
with morphisms space ei → ej equal to ej Aei . We will say that the k-category C is
connected if for any x, y ∈ C0 there exists a sequence x0 = x, . . . , xn = y in C0 such
that xi Cxi+1 6= 0 or xi+1 Cxi 6= 0 for any i. Recall that an ideal I of C is the data of vector
subspaces y Ix ⊆ y Cx for each x, y ∈ C0 , such that the composition of a morphism in I
with any morphism in C lies in I. The radical (see [6]) of C is the ideal RC of C such

                                                2
that y RCx is the set of non invertible morphisms x → y for any x, y ∈ C0 . If n > 2 we
set Rn C = (RC)n . The ordinary quiver of C has set of vertices C0 , and for x, y ∈ C0
the number of arrows x → y is exactly dimk y RCx /y R2 Cx . Finally, we say that C is
triangular if its ordinary quiver has no oriented cycle. All functors are assumed to be
k-linear functors between k-categories.
A functor F : E → B is called a covering functor (see [6]) if the following properties
are satisfied:
    a) F −1 (x) 6= ∅ for any x ∈ B0 ,
    b) for any x0 , y0 ∈ C and any x̂0 , ŷ0 ∈ E0 such that F (x̂0 ) = x0 and F (ŷ0 ) = y0 , the
following maps induced by F are isomorphisms:
                        M                           M
                             ŷ Ex̂0 → y0 Bx0 and        ŷ0 Ex̂ → y0 Bx0 .
                      F (ŷ)=y                         F (x̂)=x

In particular, if u ∈ y0 Bx0 , the inverse images of u by these isomorphisms will be called
the lifting of u (w.r.t. F ) with source (resp. target) x̂0 (resp. ŷ0 ). Recall that if E is
locally bounded (resp. connected) then so is B.
A G-category is a k-category C endowed with a group morphism G → Aut(C). More-
over, if the induced action of G on C0 is free, then C is called a free G-category. The
quotient category C/G of a free G-category C (see [7] for instance) has set of objects
C0 /G. For any α, β ∈ C0 /G we set:
                                                         
                                               M
                                β (C/G)α =
                                                         
                                                      y Cx /G
                                                  x∈α,y∈β

and the composition is induced by the composition in C. The natural projection
C → C/G is a covering functor. A Galois covering with group G is a functor
F : E → B with E a free G-category and such that there exists a commutative diagram:
                                                       E=
                                                  ||     =
                                                         == F

                                              |              ==
                                          |} |

                                    E/G                        /B
where E → E/G is the natural projection and the horizontal arrow is an isomorphism.
In particular a Galois covering is a covering functor. A connected Galois covering
is a Galois covering E → B where E is connected.
A G-graded category is a k-category C such that each morphism space has a decom-
position y Cx = ⊕g∈G y Cxg satisfying z Cyg . y Cxh ⊆ z Cxgh . The smash-product category
                                                                                   −1
(see [7]) C♯G has set of objects (C♯G)0 = C0 × G, and (y,t) (C♯G)(x,s) = y Cxt s for
(x, s) and (y, t) in (C♯G)0 . The composition in C♯G is induced by the composition in
C. The natural projection F : C♯G → C, defined by F (x, s) = x and F (u) = u for
u ∈ (y,t) (C♯G)(x,s) ⊆ y Cx , is a Galois covering with group G. It has been shown in [7]
that if p : E → B is a Galois covering with group G, then B is a G-graded category and
there exists a commutative diagram:
                                              ∼      / B♯G

Quivers with admissible relations
Let Q be a locally finite quiver with set of vertices Q0 , set of arrows Q1 and source
and target maps s, t : Q1 → Q0 respectively. Recall that locally finite means that s−1 (x)
and t−1 (x) are finite sets for any x ∈ Q0 . For simplicity we will write x+ (resp. x− )
for the set s−1 (x) (resp. t−1 (x)). A (non trivial) oriented path in Q is a non empty
sequence α1 , . . . , αn of arrows of Q such that s(αi+1 ) = t(αi ) for any 1 6 i 6 n − 1.
Such a path is written αn . . . α1 , its source (resp. target) is s(α1 ) (resp. t(αn )). For
each x ∈ Q0 we will write ex for the (trivial) path of length 0 and with source and
target equal to x. The path category kQ has set of objects Q0 , the morphism space
y kQx is the vector space with basis the set of oriented paths in Q with source x and
target y (including ex in case x = y). The composition of morphisms in kQ is induced
by the concatenation of paths. Notice that kQ is a free k-category in the following
                                               F
sense: for any k-category C, a functor kQ −    → C is uniquely determined by the family
                                           α
of morphisms {F (α) ∈ F (y) CF (x) | x −   → y ∈ Q1 }. We will denote by kQ+ the ideal
of kQ generated by Q1 . NoticePalso that if Q0 is finite then kQ is also a k-algebra,
kQ = ⊕x,y y kQx , with unit 1 = x∈Q0 ex , and kQ+ becomes an ideal of this k-algebra.
If r ∈ y kQx we define the support of r (denoted by supp(r)) to be the set of paths
in Q which appear in r with a non zero P coefficient. Moreover,∗ we define normal form
of r as an equality of the type r = i λi ui such that λi ∈ k for any i and where the
paths ui are pairwise distinct. An admissible ideal of kQ is an ideal I ⊆ kQ such
that I ⊆ (kQ+ )2 and such that for any x ∈ Q0 there exists n > 2 such that I contains
all the paths with length at least n and with source or target x. The couple (Q, I) is
then called a quiver with admissible relations and the quotient category kQ/I is
locally bounded. When Q0 is finite, an admissible ideal I of kQ is exactly an ideal I
of the k-algebra kQ such that (kQ+ )n ⊆ I ⊆ (kQ+ )2 for some integer n > 2. Recall
from [6] that if C is a locally bounded k-category then there exists an admissible ideal
                                                                              ∼
I for the ordinary quiver Q of C and there exists an isomorphism kQ/I −       → C. Such an
isomorphism is called a presentation of C with quiver and (admissible) relations
(or an admissible presentation for short). Similarly, if A is a basic finite dimensional
                                                                                        ∼
k-algebra, an admissible presentation of A is an isomorphism of k-algebras kQ/I −       →A
where (Q, I) is a bound quiver.
Transvections, dilatations
A bypass (see [2]) in Q is a couple (α, u) where α 6= u, α ∈ Q1 and u is a path in Q
parallel to α (this means that α and u share the same source and the same target). A
double bypass is a 4-tuple (α, u, β, v) such that (α, u) and (β, v) are bypasses and such
that the arrow β appears in the path u. Notice that if α, β are distinct parallel arrows
of Q, then (α, β, β, α) is a double bypass. Notice also that if u = va is an oriented
cycle in Q with first arrow a, then (a, au, a, au) is a double bypass. Hence, if Q has
no double bypass, then Q has no distinct parallel arrows and no oriented cycle. If A is
a basic k-algebra with quiver Q, we will say that A has no double bypass if Q has
no double bypass. A transvection is an automorphism of the k-category kQ of the
form ϕα,u,τ where (α, u) is a bypass, τ ∈ k and ϕα,u,τ is given by ϕα,u,τ (α) = α + τ u
and ϕα,u,τ (β) = β for any arrow β 6= α (this uniquely defines ϕα,u,τ since kQ is a free
k-category). Notice that Q has no double bypass if and only if any two transvections
                                                        ∼
commute. A dilatation is an automorphism D : kQ −       → kQ such that D(α) ∈ k∗ α for
any arrow α. Notice that the definitions of transvections and dilatations are analogous
to those of transvection and dilatation matrices (see [15, Chap. XIII, § 9] for instance).


                                             4
Recall that a dilatation matrix of GLn (k) is a diagonal invertible matrix with at most
one diagonal entry different from 1 and a transvection matrix is a matrix with diagonal
entries equal to 1 and which has at most one non diagonal entry different from 0.
Fundamental group, coverings of quivers with relations
Let (Q, I) be a quiver with admissible relations. For each arrow α ∈ Q1 we will write α−1
for its formal inverse with source (resp. target) s(α−1 ) = t(α) (resp. t(α−1 ) = s(α)).
A walk is an unoriented path in Q. More precisely it is a formal product un . . . u1 of
arrows and of formal inverses of arrows such that s(ui+1 ) = t(ui ) for any 1 6 i 6 n − 1.
Let r = t1 u1 + . . . + tn un ∈ y Ix where ti ∈ k∗ and where the paths ui are distinct. Then
r is called a minimal   P relation if n > 1 and if for any non empty proper subset E of
{1, . . . , n} we have i∈E ti ui 6∈ y Ix . With this definition, any r ∈ I can be written
as the sum of minimal relations with pairwise disjoint supports. Notice that in this
definition we do not assume n to be greater than or equal to 2 as done usually (see
[17]). This change is done for simplicity and does not affect the constructions which
follow. The homotopy relation of (Q, I) is the smallest equivalence relation ∼I on
the set of walks (in Q) which is compatible with the concatenation of walks and such
that:
                                                         α
    . αα−1 ∼I ey and α−1 α ∼I ex for any arrow x −      → y,
    . u1 ∼I u2 for any minimal relation t1 u1 + . . . + tn un .
Notice that in order to compute ∼I we may restrict ourselves to any set of minimal
relations generating the ideal I (see [9]). Assume that Q is connected (i.e. Q is con-
nected as an unoriented graph) and let x0 ∈ Q0 . The fundamental group (see [17])
π1 (Q, I, x0 ) of (Q, I) at x0 is the set of ∼I -classes of walks starting and ending at x0 .
The composition is induced by the concatenation of walks and the unit is the ∼I -class
of ex0 . Since different choices for x0 give rise to isomorphic fundamental groups (since
Q is connected) we shall write π1 (Q, I) for short.

Example 1. (see [3]) Assume that Q is the following quiver:

and π1 (Q, J) = 0.

morphism Q′ −     → Q such that p(I ′ ) ⊆ I and such that:
   a) p−1 (x) 6= ∅ for any x ∈ Q0 ,

Recall that the automorphism group Aut(Q, I) of a bound quiver (Q, I) is the group of
                           ∼                                                                    p
automorphisms g : Q −      → Q of the quiver Q such that g(I) ⊆ I. Assume that (Q′ , I ′ ) −   →
(Q, I) is a covering, then the group of automorphisms of p is defined by Aut(p) =
                                                 p
{g ∈ Aut(Q′ , I ′ ) | p ◦ g = p}. If (Q′ , I ′ ) −
                                                 → (Q, I) is a covering and if G is a subgroup of
Aut(p), then p is called a Galois covering with group G if Q and Q′ are connected
                                                                                       p
and if G acts transitively on p−1 (x) for any x ∈ Q0 . Notice that if (Q′ , I ′ ) −    → (Q, I) is

a covering (resp. a Galois covering with group G) then the induced functor kQ′ /I ′ −       →
kQ/I is a covering functor (resp. a Galois covering with group G). Let (Q, I) be a
connected quiver with admissible relations and let x0 ∈ Q0 . The universal cover of
                                   ˜ −π
(Q, I) is a Galois covering (Q̃, I)  → (Q, I) with group π1 (Q, I, x0 ) as defined in [17].
One can describe it as follows: Q̃0 is the set of ∼I -classes [w] of walks w starting at
x0 . The arrows of Q̃ are the couples (α, [w]) where α ∈ Q1 and [w] ∈ Q̃0 are such that
s(α) = t(w). The source (resp. target) of the arrow (α, [w]) is [w] (resp. [αw]). The
         p
map Q̃ − → Q is defined by p([w]) = t(w) and p(α, [w]) = α. The ideal I˜ is equal to
                                                   ˜ is the following: if g ∈ π1 (Q, I) we
p−1 (I). Finally, the action of π1 (Q, I) on (Q̃, I)
may write g = [γ] with γ some walk with source and target equal to x0 . Then for any
[w] ∈ Q̃0 (resp. (α, [w]) ∈ Q̃1 ) we have g.[w] = [wγ −1 ] (resp. g.(α, [w]) = (α, [wγ −1 ])).
Some linear algebra
We introduce here some notions that will be useful in the sequel and that will be used
without reference. Let E be a finite dimensional k-vector space with basis (e1 , . . . , en )
and let (e∗1 , . . . , e∗n ) be the corresponding dual basis (i.e. e∗i (ei ) = 1 and e∗i (ej ) = 0 if
j 6= i). If {rt }t∈T is a family in E, then Span(rt ; t ∈ T ) will denote the subspace of E
generated by this family. If r ∈ E we will write supp(r) (the support of r) for the set of
those e′i s appearing in r with a non zero coefficient. Therefore ei ∈ supp(r) is equivalent
to e∗i (r) 6= 0. Let F ⊆ E be a subspace. A non zero element r ∈ F is called minimal
if it cannot be written as the sum of two non zero elements of F with disjoint sup-
ports. We will denote by ≡F the smallest equivalence relation on {e1 , . . . , en } such that
ei ≡F ej for any r ∈ F minimal and any ei , ej ∈ supp(r). Like in the situation of the
homotopy relation of a bound quiver, the equivalence relation ≡F is determined by any
generating family of F made of minimal elements. Notice that if E is the vector space
with basis the set of oriented paths in a finite quiver Q (without oriented cycle) and if
I is an admissible ideal of kQ, then for any paths u and v we have: u ≡I v ⇒ u ∼I v.
The converse is usually false as one can see in Example 1 where a ∼J cb and a 6≡J cb.
Assume now that the basis of E is totally ordered: e1 < . . . < en . A Gröbner basis of
F is a basis (r1 , . . . , rt ) of F such that:
     . for any j there is some ij such that rj ∈ eij + Span(ei ; i < ij ).
     . eij 6∈ supp(r                       ′
                       P j ′ ) unless j = j .
     . if r = el + i<l τi ei ∈ F then el = eij for some j.
With this definition, F has a unique Gröbner basis which has a natural total order:
r1 < . . . < rt if we assume that i1 < . . . < it . Moreover, r1 , . . . , rt are minimal ele-
ments of F . This last property implies in particular that ei ≡F ej if and only if there
exists a sequence of integers m1 , . . . , mp such that ei ∈ supp(rm1 ), ej ∈ supp(rmp ) and
supp(rmj ) ∩ supp(rmj+1 ) 6= ∅ for each j. Notice that our definition of Gröbner basis is
slightly different from the classical one (see e.g. [1]) since we do not use any multiplica-
tive structure. Moreover, our definition is linked with the notion of reduced echelon
form matrix (see [14, p. 65]). We may also point out that a study of Gröbner bases in
path algebras of quivers has been made in [8].
We end this paragraph with a reminder on the exponential and on the logarithm of an
endomorphism. If u :P           E → E is a nilpotent endomorphism, we define the exponential
of u to be exp(u) = l>0 l!1 ul . Thus, exp(u) : E → E is a well defined linear isomor-
phism such that exp(u) − Id is nilpotent. If v : E → E is an P              isomorphism such that
v −Id is nilpotent, we define the logarithm of v to be log(v) = l>0 (−1)l+1 1l (v −Id)l .
Recall that if u : E → E is a nilpotent endomorphism, then log(exp(u)) = u.

2     Proof of Theorem 1
In this section we provide the proof of Theorem 1 (see also [16, Thm 1.1]). We fix
A a basic connected finite dimensional k-algebra with quiver Q. Throughout this
section we will assume that Q has no oriented cycle. The proof of Theorem 1
decomposes into 4 steps as follows, and we will devote a subsection to each step:
                                                                                             ∼
    a) If kQ/I and kQ/J are isomorphic to A as k-algebras, then there exists ϕ : kQ −        →
kQ a product of transvections and of a dilatation such that ϕ(I) = J.
    b) If ϕ(I) = J and if ϕ is a dilatation then π1 (Q, I) ≃ π1 (Q, J). If ϕ is a transvection,
then there exists a surjective group morphism π1 (Q, I) → π1 (Q, J) or π1 (Q, J) →
π1 (Q, I), induced by the identity map on the walks in Q.
    c) The homotopy relations ∼I of the admissible presentations kQ/I of A can be
displayed as the vertices of a quiver Γ such that for any arrow ∼I →∼J the identity
map on walks induces a surjective group morphism π1 (Q, I) ։ π1 (Q, J).
    d) If k has characteristic zero and if Q has no double bypass, then the quiver Γ has
a unique source. Moreover, if ∼I0 is the source of Γ then I0 fits Theorem 1.

2.1 Different presentations of an algebra are linked by products of
transvections and dilatations
In order to consider A as a k-category we need to choose a decomposition of the unit
into a sum of primitive orthogonal idempotents. The following proposition shows that
this choice is unrelevant and that we may fix these idempotents once and for all. We
will omit the proof which is basic linear algebra.

Proposition 2.1. [16, 3.1] Let I and J be admissible ideals of kQ. If kQ/I ≃ kQ/J
                                       ∼
as k-algebras then there exists ϕ : kQ −
                                       → kQ an automorphism extending the identity
map on Q0 and such that ϕ(I) = J.

   Recall that GLn (k) is generated by transvection and dilatation matrices. The fol-
lowing proposition states an analogous result for the group of automorphisms of kQ
extending the identity map on Q0 .

Proposition 2.2. Let G be the group of automorphisms of kQ extending the identity
map on Q0 . Let D ⊆ G be the subgroup of the dilatations of kQ and let T ⊆ G
be the subgroup generated by the transvections. Then T is a normal subgroup and
G = DT = T D.

Remark 1. The group of automorphisms of an algebra has already been studied. More
precisely the reader can find in [13], [20] and [21] a study of the group of outer auto-
morphisms of an algebra.

Proof of Proposition 2.2: For any transvection ϕ = ϕα,u,τ and any dilatation D
we have DϕD −1 = ϕα,u, τ λ where λ ∈ k∗ and µ ∈ k∗ are such that D(u) = λ u and
                            µ
D(α) = µ α. Hence, in order to prove the proposition, it is enough to prove that
G = T D. If ψ ∈ G we shall write n(ψ) for the number of arrows α ∈ Q1 such that
ψ(α) 6∈ k∗ α. Notice that n(ψ) = 0 if and only if ψ ∈ D. Let us prove by induction
on n > 0 that Rn : “n(ψ) 6 n ⇒ ψ ∈ T D” is true. Obviously R0 is true. Let n > 1,
assume that Rn−1 is true, and let ψ ∈ G such that n(ψ) = n. Hence, there exists
   α1
x −→  y ∈ Q1 such that ψ(α1 ) 6∈ k∗ α1 . Let α1 , . . . , αd be the arrows x → y of Q and

                                              7
                                                                ψ
let E = Span(α1 , . . . , αd ) ≃   y   kQ+ /(kQ+ )2 x . Since kQ −
                                                                 → kQ is an automorphism,
                                        ψ
the composition f : E ֒→ y kQx −          → y kQx ։ E of ψ with the natural inclusion and
the natural projection is a k-linear isomorphism hence an element of GLd (k). Thus
(see [15, Chap. XIII Prop. 9.1]) there exist transvections matrices f1 , . . . , fl ∈ GLd (k)
such that f1 . . . fl f (αi ) ∈ k∗ αi for each i ∈ {1, . . . , d}. For each fj , let f¯j : kQ → kQ
be the automorphism such that f¯j (αi ) = fj (αi ) for each i ∈ {1, . . . , d} and such that
f¯j (β) = β for any arrow β not parallel to α1 . In particular, f¯j is a transvection with
respect to some αij . Let g1 = f¯1 . . . f¯l ∈ T . Then, g1 ψ(αi ) ∈ k∗ αi + (kQ+ )2 and if
β ∈ Q1 is not parallel to α1 and satisfies ψ(β) ∈ k∗ β then g1 ψ(β) ∈ P       k∗ β. Let ψ1 = g1 ψ.
By construction, for each i ∈ {1, . . . , d}, we have ψ1 (αi ) = λi αi + nj=1      i
                                                                                       τi,j ui,j with
ui,j paths of length at least 2. Let ϕi,j be the transvection ϕαi ,ui,j ,−τi,j /λi for each
i ∈ {1, . . . , d} and each j ∈ {1, . . . , ni }, and let g2 ∈ T be the product of the ϕi,j ’s (for
any i ∈ {1, . . . , d} and any j ∈ {1, . . . , ni }). It is easy to check that the transvections
ϕi,j commute between each other so that the definition of g2 is unambiguous. Since Q
has no oriented cycle, we have g2 ψ1 (αi ) = λi αi for each i, and g2 ψ1 (β) ∈ k∗ β if β ∈ Q1
is not parallel to α1 and satisfies ψ1 (β) ∈ k∗ β. In particular: n(g2 g1 ψ) < n(ψ) = n.
Since Rn−1 is true, g2 g1 ψ lies in T D and so does ψ (recall g1 , g2 ∈ T ). Hence, Rn is
true. This achieves the proof of Proposition 2.2.                                                  


Remark 2. Proposition 2.1 and Proposition 2.2 imply that if I and J are admissible
ideals of kQ such that kQ/I ≃ kQ/J as k-algebras, then there exist ϕ1 , . . . , ϕn (resp.
ϕ′1 , . . . , ϕ′m ) a sequence of transvections of kQ, together with D a dilatation such that
J = Dϕn . . . ϕ1 (I) (resp. J = ϕ′m . . . ϕ′1 D(I)).

2.2 Comparison of the fundamental group of two presentations of an
algebra linked by a transvection or a dilatation
If I is an ideal and ϕ is a dilatation or a transvection, then I and ϕ(I) are similar enough
in order to compare the associated homotopy relations. Before stating this comparison
we prove two useful lemmas. We fix I an admissible ideal of kQ, we fix ϕ = ϕα,u,τ a
transvection (τ 6= 0) and we set J = ϕ(I).
Lemma 2.3.   P Assume thatP α 6∼I u and let r ∈ y Ix be a minimal relation with normal
form r =       C λc θ c +   B λb vb αub such that α does not appear in the path θc for
       ∈                                                 ′                         ′

   C λc θ c +   B λb vb αub +    B ′ λb τ vb uub where B ⊆ B.

Proof: Let us assume that B 6= ∅ (if B = ∅, the conclusion is immediate). Since Q has
no oriented cycle, the paths vb and ub do not contain α. Since r is a minimal relation
of I and since α 6∼I u,  P we have θcP    6= vb uub for any
                                                          Pc ∈ C, b ∈ B. Therefore, ϕ(r) has a
normal form ϕ(r) = C λc θc + B λb vb αub + B λb τ vP               b uub ∈ y Jx \{0}.
                                                                                 P Thus there
                                 ′                             ′

                                     ′ ⊆ B, C ′ ⊆ C and B ′ ⊆ B. Hence ϕ−1 (r ′ ) has a normal

exists a minimal relation r ′′ ∈ y Ix with normal form r ′′ = C ′′ λc θc + B ′′ λb vb αub
such that C ′′ ⊆ C ′ ⊆ C and ∅ =      6 B ′′ ⊆ B1′ . This forces C ′′ = C and B ′′ = B because
r ∈ y Ix is a minimal relation. Thus C ′ = C and B1′ = B. Hence we have a minimal

Lemma 2.4. Assume that α ∼J u and let r ∈ y Ix be a minimal relation. Then v ∼J w
for any v, w ∈ supp(r).
                                 P             P
Proof: We may write r = C λc θc + B λb vb αub + µb vb uub where:
. λc , λb ∈ k∗ and µb ∈ k for any c ∈ C and b ∈ B,
. the paths θc , vb αub , vb′ uub′ (c ∈ C, b, b′ ∈ B) are pairwise distinct,
. for any c ∈ C,Pthe path θcP     does not contain α.
Hence ϕ(r) = C λc θc + B λb vb αub + (µb + τ λb ) vb uub ∈ y Jx and there exists a
decomposition ϕ(r) = r1 + . . . + rn where ri ∈ y Jx is a minimal relation and supp(ri ) ∩
supp(rj ) = ∅ if i 6= j. If B = ∅ then ϕ(r) = r ∈ y Jx is a minimal relation and
the lemma is proved. Hence we may assume that B 6= ∅. This implies that for any
i ∈ {1, . . . , n} there exists b ∈ B  Psuch that vb αub ∈ supp(ri ) or vb uub ∈′ supp(ri ) (if
this is not P   the case then ri =       C ′ λc θc for some non empty subset C of C, thus
ϕ−1 (ri ) =       C ′ λ θ

                              y x   which   contradicts the minimality of r). Let ≡ be the
smallest equivalence relation on the set {1, . . . , n} such that: i ≡ j if there exists b ∈ B
such that vb αub ∈ supp(ri ) and vb uub ∈ supp(rj ). Since the ri ’s are minimal relations
of J and since α ∼J u, we get: if i ≡ j then v P      ∼J w for any v, w ∈ supp(ri )P

P O ⊆ {1, . . . , n} be a ≡-orbit and let r ′ = i∈O ri ∈ y Jx .′ Hence r = C ′ λc θc +
Let
   B ′ λb vb αu
              Pb + (µb + τP  λb ) vb uub where C ⊆ C and ∅ =    6 B ⊆ B. This implies that
ϕ−1 (r ′ ) = C ′ λc θc + B ′ λb vb αub + µb vb uub ∈ y Ix and the minimality of r yields
C ′ = C, B ′ = B, r ′ = ϕ(r) and O = {1, . . . , n}. Hence {1, . . . , n} is an ≡-orbit.
Therefore v ∼J w for any v, w ∈ supp(ϕ(r)). And since α ∼J u we infer that v ∼J w
for any v, w ∈ supp(r).                                                                      
    We can state the announced comparison now. For short, the word generated stands
for: generated as an equivalence relation compatible with the concatenation of walks and
                                                      α
such that α−1 α ∼I ex , αα−1 ∼I ey for any arrow x − → y.

Proposition 2.5. [16, 3.2] Let I be an admissible ideal of kQ, let ϕ be an automorphism
of kQ and set J = ϕ(I). If ϕ is a dilatation, then ∼I and ∼J coincide. Assume now
that ϕ = ϕα,u,τ is a transvection.
    a) if α ∼I u and α ∼J u then ∼I and ∼J coincide.
    b) if α 6∼I u and α ∼J u then ∼J is generated by ∼I and α ∼J u.
    c) if α 6∼I u and α 6∼J u then I = J and ∼I and ∼J coincide.

Remark 3. The following implication (symmetric to b)):
              if α ∼I u and α 6∼J u then ∼I is generated by ∼J and α ∼I u
is also satisfied since ϕ−1
                         α,u,τ = ϕα,u,−τ

Proof of Proposition 2.5: If ϕ is a dilatation, then ∼I and ∼J coincide because
for any r ∈ y kQx we have supp(r) = supp(ϕ(r)) and because r is a minimal relation
of I if and only if the same holds for ϕ(r) in J. Let us assume that ϕ = ϕα,u,τ is a
transvection.
a) Lemma 2.4 applied to I, J, ϕ (resp. J, I, ϕ−1 = ϕα,u,−τ ) shows that any two paths
appearing in a same minimal relation of I (resp. J) are ∼J -equivalent (resp. ∼I -
equivalent). Hence ∼I and ∼J coincide.
b) Let ≡ be the equivalence relation generated by: (v ∼I w ⇒ v ≡ w) and α ≡ u.


                                              9
Our aim is to show that ∼J and ≡ coincide. Thanks to Lemma 2.4 we have: v ≡ w ⇒
v ∼J w. Let M in(I) be the set   Pof the minimalP relations of I. For each r ∈ M in(I)
let us fix a normal form r =        C λ c θ c +  B λb vb αub satisfying the hypotheses of
Lemma    2.3. Hence there exists B ′ ⊆ B and a minimal relation r of J with normal form
      P          P               P                                 1 P
r1 = C λc θc + B λb vb αub + B ′ λb τ vb uub . Thus ϕ(r) − r1 = B\B ′ τ λb vb uub ∈ J
can be written as a sum r2 + . . . + rnr of minimal relations of J with pairwise disjoint
supports. In particular, ϕ(r) = r1 + . . . + rnr where each ri ∈ J is a minimal relation.
Notice that any two paths appearing in r1 are ≡-equivalent because of the normal
form of r1 and because of the definition of ≡. With these notations, the set {ri | r ∈
M in(I) and 1 6 i 6 nr } is made of minimal relations of J and generates the ideal
J. Thus, in order to show that ∼J and ≡ coincide, it is enough to show that any two
paths appearing in some ri are ≡-equivalent. Let r ∈ M in(I), let i ∈ {1, . . . , nr }, and
let v, w ∈ supp(ri ). We have already proved that if i = 1 then v ≡ w, thus we may
assume that i > 2. Keeping the above notations for the normal form of r, there exist
b, b′ ∈ B such that v = vb uub and w = vb′ uub′ . Since α ≡ u and since any two paths
appearing in r1 are ≡-equivalent we get v = vb uub ≡ vb αub ≡ vb′ αub′ ≡ vb′ uub′ = w.
Hence any two paths appearing in some ri are ≡-equivalent. This implies that ∼J and
≡ coincide. Therefore, ∼J is generated by ∼I and α ∼J u.
c) Let r ∈ I be a minimal relation of I and apply Lemma 2.3 to r. Since α 6∼J u, we
infer that r ∈ J. Since I is generated by its minimal relations we get I ⊆ J. Finally,
I = J because I and J have the same dimension.                                            

Remark 4. In the situation b) of Proposition 2.5, the identity map on the walks of Q
induces a surjective group morphism π1 (Q, I) ։ π1 (Q, J).

    Proposition 2.5 allows us to prove the following result which has already been proved
in [5]. Recall that the algebra kQ/I, where I is admissible, is called constricted if
dim y (kQ/I)x = 1 for any arrow x → y of Q.

Proposition 2.6 (see also [5]). Assume that A is constricted. Then different admis-
sible presentations of A yield the same homotopy relation. In particular, they have
isomorphic fundamental groups.

Proof: Let kQ/I ≃ A be any admissible presentation. If (α, u) is a bypass in Q then
u ∈ I because A is constricted and I is admissible. In particular, for any τ ∈ k and
any r ∈ kQ we have: ϕα,u,τ (r) − r belongs to the ideal of kQ generated by u ∈ I and
therefore ϕα,u,τ (r) − r ∈ I. This shows that ϕ(I) ⊆ I and that ϕ(I) = I (I is finite
dimensional because Q has no oriented cycle) for any transvection ϕ. Let kQ/J ≃ A be
another admissible presentation. From Remark 2 we know that there exist a dilatation
D and transvections ϕ1 , . . . , ϕn such that J = Dϕn . . . ϕ1 (I). We deduce from what
we have proved above that ϕn . . . ϕ1 (I) = I. Hence, J = D(I). Proposition 2.5 implies
that ∼I and ∼J coincide. Therefore, π1 (Q, I) and π1 (Q, J) are isomorphic.          
    If ∼ and ∼′ are homotopy relations, we will say that ∼′ is a direct successor (see
also [16, Sect. 3]) of ∼ if there exist admissible ideals I and J of kQ, together with
a transvection ϕ = ϕα,u,τ such that ∼=∼I , ∼′ =∼J , J = ϕ(I), α 6∼I u and α ∼J u.
Notice that I, J, ϕ need not be unique.

2.3   The quiver Γ of the homotopy relations of the presentations of
the algebra
Definition 2.7. [16, 4.1] We define the quiver Γ as follows:
. Γ0 is the set of homotopy relations of the admissible presentations of A:
                     Γ0 = { ∼I | I is admissible and kQ/I ≃ A}
. there is an arrow ∼→∼′ if and only if ∼′ is a direct successor of ∼.
Example 2. Assume that A = kQ/I where Q is

and I =< da >. Let J =< da − dcb >. Using Proposition 2.5 one can show that Γ
is equal to: ∼I    / ∼J . Notice that the identity map on walks induces a surjective
group morphism Z ≃ π1 (Q, I) ։ π1 (Q, J) ≃ 1.
   The author thanks Mariano Suárez-Alvarez for the following remark:
Remark 5. A homotopy relation is determined by its restriction to the paths in Q with
length at most the radical length of A. Thus there are only finitely many homotopy
relations. This argument shows that Γ is finite.
   The following proposition states some additional properties of Γ and is a direct
consequence of Remark 2 and Proposition 2.5.
Proposition 2.8. Assume that Q has no oriented cycle and let m be the number of
bypasses in Q. Then Γ is connected and has no oriented cycle. Any vertex of Γ is the
source of at most m arrows and any oriented path in Γ has length at most m.
Remark 6. According to Remark 4, if there is a path in Γ with source ∼I and target
∼J , then the identity map on the walks in Q induces a surjective group morphism
π1 (Q, I) ։ π1 (Q, J). Moreover, since Γ is finite, any vertex of Γ is the target of a
(finite) path whose source is a source of Γ (i.e. a vertex with no arrow ending at it).
As a consequence, if Γ has a unique source ∼I0 , then the fundamental group of any
admissible presentation of A is a quotient of π1 (Q, I0 ).

2.4     The uniqueness of the source of Γ and the proof of Theorem 1
Notice that until now we have used neither the characteristic of k nor the possible non
existence of a double bypass in Q. These hypotheses will be needed in order to prove
the uniqueness of the source of Γ. The complete proof of the uniqueness of the source
of Γ is somewhat technical. For this reason we deal with the technical considerations
in the two lemmas that follow.
Lemma 2.9. Let E be a finite dimensional k-vector space endowed with a totally ordered
basis e1 < . . . < en . Assume that k has characteristic zero. Let ν : E → E be a linear
map such that ν(ei ) ∈ Span(ej ; j < i) for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, and let I and J be two
subspaces of E such that the following conditions are satisfied:
    a) ψ(I) = J where ψ : E → E is equal to exp(ν).
    b) if ei ∈ supp(ν(ej )) then ei 6≡I ej and ei 6≡J ej .
Then I and J have the same Gröbner basis and I = J.

                                              11
Proof: Let us prove Lemma 2.9 by induction on n. If n = 1 the equality is obvious so
let us assume that n > 1 and that the conclusion of Lemma 2.9 holds for dimensions
less than n. We will denote by r1 < . . . < rp (resp. r1′ < . . . < rp′ ) the Gröbner basis
of I (resp. of J) and we will write i1 , . . . , ip (resp. i′1 , . . . , i′p ) for the integers such that
rj ∈ eij + Span(ei ; i < ij ) (resp. rj′ ∈ ei′j + Span(ei ; i < i′j )). In order to prove that
I = J we will prove the four following facts:
  a) the two sequences i1 < . . . < ip and i′1 < . . . < i′p coincide,
  b) ψ(r1 ) = r1′ ,
  c) r1 = r1′ and ν(r1 ) = 0 (using the induction hypothesis on E/k.e1 ),
  d) r2 = r2′ , . . . , rp = rp′ (using the induction hypothesis on E/k.r1 ).

a) For simplicity let us set Ei = Span(ej ; j 6 i). Since ν(e                     j ) ∈ Ej−1 and rj ∈
eij +Eij −1 , and since ψ = exp(ν), we get ψ(rj ) ∈ J ∩ eij + Eij −1 for any j. Hence, the
definition of the Gröbner basis of J forces {i1 , . . . , ip } ⊆ {i′1 , . . . , i′p } and the cardinality
and the ordering on these two sets imply that i1 = i′1 , . . . , ip = i′p
b) Since i1 = i′1 we infer that ψ(r1 )−r1′ ∈ J ∩Ei1 −1 . Then, the definition of the Gröbner
basis of J forces ψ(r1 ) − r1′ = 0.
c) Let us prove that r1 = r1′ . Notice that the definition of a Gröbner basis and the
equalities ψ(r1 ) = r1′ and ψ(e1 ) = e1 force: e1 ∈ I ⇔ r1 = e1 ⇔ r1′ = e1 ⇔ e1 ∈ J.
Hence we may assume that e1 6∈ I and e1 6∈ J.
Let E e = E/k.e1 and let π : E ։ E       e be the natural projection. We will write x  e for
π(x). Similarly we set Ie = π(I) and Je = π(J). In particular E     e has a totally ordered
basis: ee2 < . . . < een . Since ν(e1 ) = 0 and since ψ(e1 ) = e1 , the mappings ν and ψ
induce linear mappings νe, ψe : E  e → E.e It follows from the properties of ν and ψ that
 e I)
ψ( e = J, e that νe(e             ej ; 2 6 j < i) for any i > 2, that ψe = exp(e
                      ei ) ∈ Span(e                                            ν ), and that
supp(e    ei )) = { eej | j > 2 and ej ∈ supp(ν(ei ))} for any i > 2. Moreover, with the
       ν (e
definition of the Gröbner basis of I we get:
    . rej ∈ eeij + Span(e
                        ei ; i < ij ) for any j (recall that e1 6∈ I),
           rj ) = {e
    . supp(e       ei | i > 2 and ei ∈ supp(rj )} for any j.
Therefore re1 < . . . < rep is the Gröbner basis of Ie and: eei ≡Ie eej ⇒ ei ≡I ej . Similarly
re1′ < . . . < rep′ is the Gröbner basis of Je and: eei ≡Je eej ⇒ ei ≡J ej . Using the above
description of supp(e        ei )) together with the above link between ≡I (resp. ≡J ) and ≡Ie
                          ν (e
(resp. ≡Je) we infer that:

                       eei 6≡Ie eej and eei 6≡Je eej as soon as eej ∈ supp(e
                                                                           ν (e
                                                                              ei ))

For this reason we may apply the induction hypothesis to E,    e Ie and J.
                                                                         e Hence Ie and Je
                                            ′       ′
have the same Gröbner basis and re1 = re1 i.e. r1 = r1 + λ e1 with λ ∈ k. Therefore
(ψ−Id)(r1 ) = λ e1 , and since ψ(e1 ) = e1 we get ν(r1 ) = log(ψ)(r1 ) = λ e1 . Assume that
λ 6= 0 i.e. e1 ∈ supp(ν(r1 )). Thus there exists ei ∈ supp(r1 ) such that e1 ∈ supp(ν(ei )).
This implies that e1 6≡I ei , and since any two elements in supp(r1 ) are ≡I -equivalent,
this forces e1 6∈ supp(r1 ). Hence ei , e1 ∈ supp(r1′ ) = supp(r1 ) ⊔ {e1 } and therefore
ei ≡J e1 . This contradicts e1 ∈ supp(ν(ei )) and shows that λ = 0, that r1 = r1′ and
that ν(r1 ) = 0.



                                                   12
d) Let us show that r2 = r2′ , . . . , rp = rp′ . For this purpose we will apply the induction
hypothesis to Ē = E/k.r1 . Let q : E ։ Ē be the natural projection. We will write ēi
        ¯ J¯, r̄j , r̄ ′ ) for q(ei ) (resp. q(I), q(J), q(rj ), q(r ′ )). Hence Ē has a totally ordered
(resp. I,             j                                             j
basis: ē1 < . . . < ēi1 −1 < ēi1 +1 < . . . < ēn . Since ν(r1 ) = 0 and since ψ(r1 ) = r1 , the
mappings ν and ψ induce linear mappings ν̄, ψ̄ : Ē → Ē. These mappings obviously
           ¯ = J,
satisfy ψ̄(I)        ¯ ν̄(ēi ) ∈ Span(ēj ; j 6= i1 and j < i) for any i 6= i1 , and ψ̄ = exp(ν̄).
Moreover, our choice for the basis of Ē and the definition of the Gröbner basis of I
imply that:
    . supp(r̄j ) = {ēi | ei ∈ supp(rj )} for any j > 2,
                                                 ¯
    . r̄2 < . . . < r̄p is the Gröbner basis of I.
These two properties imply in particular that: ēi ≡I¯ ēj ⇒ ei ≡I ej for any i, j 6= i1 .
The corresponding properties hold for J¯ (replace rj by rj′ , I by J and I¯ by J).      ¯ Thus,
in order to apply the induction hypothesis to Ē it only remains to prove that: ēj ∈
supp(ν̄(ēi )) ⇒ ēi 6≡I¯ ēj and ēi 6≡J¯ ēj for any i, j 6= i1 . Assume that i, j 6= i1 satisfy
ēj ∈ supp(ν̄(ēi )). From the definition of Ē and ν̄ we know that:
    . supp(ν̄(ēi )) = {ēl | el ∈ supp(ν(ei ))} if ei1 6∈ supp(ν(ei )),
    . supp(ν̄(ēi )) ⊆ {ēl | el ∈ supp(ν(ei )) and l 6= i1 } ∪ {ēl | l < i1 and el ∈ supp(r1 )}
      if ei1 ∈ supp(ν(ei )).
Let us distinguish the cases ej ∈ supp(ν(ei )) and ej 6∈ supp(ν(ei )):
    · if ej ∈ supp(ν(ei )) then ei 6≡I ej and ei 6≡J ej and the above comparison between
≡I (resp. ≡J ) and ≡I¯ (resp. ≡J¯) yields ēi 6≡I¯ ēj and ēi 6≡J¯ ēj .
    · if ej 6∈ supp(ν(ei )) then necessarily ei1 ∈ supp(ν(ei )) and ej ∈ supp(r1 ). Since
r1 = r1′ , the property ej ∈ supp(r1 ) implies that ej ≡I ei1 and ej ≡J ei1 . On the other
hand, the property ei1 ∈ supp(ν(ei )) implies that ei1 6≡I ei and ei1 6≡J ei . Therefore
ej 6≡I ei and ej 6≡J ei and finally ēj 6≡I¯ ēi and ēj 6≡J¯ ēi .
Thus all the conditions of Lemma 2.9 are satisfied for Ē, I,       ¯ J,
                                                                      ¯ ν̄. For this reason we can
                                                      ¯     ¯
apply the induction hypothesis which gives: I and J have the same Gröbner basis. We
infer that q(ri ) = q(ri′ ) for each i = 2, . . . , p. Hence for each i > 2 there exists λi ∈ k
such that ri = ri′ + λi r1 , and λi is necessarily zero because e∗i1 (ri ) = e∗i1 (ri′ ) = 0 (cf
the definition of a Gröbner basis). Therefore ri = ri′ for each i = 1, . . . , p and I = J as
announced.                                                                                       


Lemma 2.10. Let ϕ : kQ → kQ be an automorphism extending the identity map on Q0 .
Let I be an admissible ideal of kQ and set J = ϕ(I). Suppose that k hasPcharacteristic
zero. Suppose that for any arrow α there is a normal form ϕ(α) = α + i λi ui where
each ui satisfies: α 6∼I ui , α 6∼J ui and ϕ(a) = a for any arrow appearing in ui (in
particular ϕ(ui ) = ui ). Then I and J coincide.

Proof: Let E be the vector space kQ = ⊕x,y y kQx . Hence E is finite dimensional since
Q has no oriented cycle, and I and J can be considered as subspaces of E. In order to
apply Lemma 2.9 to E, I, J, we need to exhibit a totally ordered basis of E together
with a mapping ν : E → E. Let us take the family of paths in Q for the basis of E.
The following construction of a total order < on this basis is taken from [8]. Let us fix
a total order on Q0 ∪ Q1 (which is finite) and let ≺ be the induced lexicographical order
on the paths in Q (ex ≺ u if u is non trivial). If u is a path we let W (u) be the number


                                                   13
of arrows α ∈ Q1 appearing in u and such that ϕ(α) 6= α. Hence, for any α ∈ Q1 , we
have W (α) = 0 if ϕ(α) = α and W (α) = 1 if ϕ(α) 6= α. The total order < is then
defined as follows:             
                                 W (u) < W (v)
                      u<v ⇔       or
                                
                                  W (u) = W (v) and u ≺ v
This yields: e1 < . . . < en a totally ordered basis of E made of the paths in Q. Notice
that with this basis, the equivalence relations ≡I and ∼I (resp. ≡J and ∼J ) satisfy the
following property: ei ≡I ej ⇒ ei ∼I ej (resp. ei ≡J ej ⇒ ei ∼J ej ). Let ν : kQ → kQ
be the derivation (i.e. the k-linear map such that ν(vu) = ν(v)u + vν(u) for any u and
v) such that ν(ex ) = 0 for any x ∈ Q0 and ν(α) = ϕ(α) − α for any arrow α ∈ Q1 .
Thus, for any path u and any v ∈ supp(ν(u)) there exist an arrow α ∈ Q1 together
with paths u1 , u2 , u3 such that u = u3 αu1 , v = u3 u2 u1 and u2 ∈ supp(ν(α)). Notice
that with the assumptions made on ϕ, this implies that ei 6≡I ej and ei 6≡J ej as
soon as ej ∈ supp(ν(ei )). Moreover, for any α ∈ Q1 and any u ∈ supp(ν(α)) we have
W (u) = 0, hence ν ◦ ν(α) = 0. Since ν : kQ → kQ is a derivation, we infer that:
ej ∈ supp(ν(ei )) ⇒ W (ej ) < W (ei ) ⇒ ej < ei . Hence ν(ei ) ∈ Span(ej ; j < i) for any
i. In order to apply Lemma 2.9, it only remains to prove that J = exp(ν)(I). To do
this it suffices to prove that ϕ = exp(ν). Since ν is a derivation, exp(ν) : kQ → kQ is
an automorphism such that exp(ν)(ex ) = ex for any x ∈ Q0 (recall that ν(ex ) = 0).
Moreover, if α ∈ Q1 then ν 2 (α) = 0 and ν(α) = ϕ(α) − α, therefore exp(ν)(α) = ϕ(α).
Hence ϕ and exp(ν) are automorphisms of kQ and they coincide on Q0 ∪ Q1 . This
implies that ϕ = exp(ν). Hence, the data E, I, J, ν together with the ordered basis
e1 < . . . < en satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma 2.9 which implies that I = J.           
   The uniqueness of the source of Γ is given by the following result.

Proposition 2.11. [16, 4.3] Assume that A satisfies the hypotheses made before stating
Theorem 1, then Γ has a unique source.

Proof: Notice that any two transvections of kQ commute since Q has no double
bypass. Let ∼ and ∼′ be sources of Γ. Let I and J be admissible ideals of kQ such
that kQ/I ≃ A ≃ kQ/J and such that ∼=∼I and ∼′ =∼J . According to Remark 2
there exist a sequence of transvections ϕ1 = ϕα1 ,u1 ,τ1 , . . . , ϕn = ϕαn ,un,τn of kQ and a
dilatation D such that J = ϕn . . . ϕ1 D(I). Thanks to Proposition 2.5 we know that
∼I =∼D(I) . Thus, in order to prove that ∼=∼′ , we may assume that D = IdkQ and
J = ϕn . . . ϕ1 (I). Moreover we may assume that n is the smallest non negative integer
such that there exist I, J and a sequence of transvections ϕ1 , . . . , ϕn satisfying ∼=∼I ,
∼′ =∼J and J = ϕn . . . ϕ1 (I). Let us prove that αi 6∼I ui for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. If i
is such that αi ∼I ui then Proposition 2.5 implies that ∼I =∼ϕi (I) since ∼I is a source
of Γ. Hence ∼=∼ϕi (I) , ∼′ =∼J and J = ϕn . . . ϕi+1 ϕi−1 . . . ϕ1 (ϕi (I)) which contradicts
the minimality of n. Thus αi 6∼I ui for any i and the same arguments apply to J since
I = ϕ−1        −1
      1 . . . ϕn (J) and since ∼J is a source of Γ. Hence αi 6∼J ui for any i. This shows
that the data I, J, ϕn . . . ϕ1 satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma 2.10. We infer that I = J
and that ∼=∼′ . This shows that Γ has a unique source.                                      
   Proposition 2.11 and Remark 6 prove Theorem 1:

Theorem 1. (see also [16, Thm 1.1]) Let A be a basic connected finite dimensional
algebra over a field k of characteristic zero. If the quiver Q of A has no double bypass,


                                             14
then there exists a presentation kQ/I0 ≃ A with quiver and admissible relations such
that for any other admissible presentation kQ/I ≃ A, the identity map on walks induces
a surjective group morphism π1 (Q, I0 ) ։ π1 (Q, I).
   The following example shows that one cannot remove the hypothesis on the char-
acteristic of k in Proposition 2.11:

Example 3. Let Q be the following quiver without double bypass:
                                         ? ?           ? ??? f

                                         a                d
Set u = cb and v = f e. Set A = kQ/I0 where I0 =< da + vu, va + du >. Then
π1 (Q, I1 ) = Z/2. Let I1 and I2 be the ideals defined below:
    • I1 = ϕa,u,1 (I0 ) =< da + du + vu, va + du + vu >,
    • I2 = ϕa,u,−1 ◦ ϕd,v,−1 (I0 ) =< da, va + du − 2vu >.
Hence A ≃ kQ/I1 ≃ kQ/I2 . If car(k) = 0, then π1 (Q, I1 ) = π1 (Q, I2 ) = 1 and Γ is
equal to ∼I0         / ∼I1 . Suppose now that car(k) = 2. Then I2 =< da, va + du >,
π1 (Q, I0 ) ≃ Z/2, π1 (Q, I1 ) = 1, π1 (Q, I2 ) ≃ Z and Γ is equal to ∼I0 →∼I1 ←∼I2 . Hence
Γ has two sources. Notice that the identity map on walks induces a surjective group
morphism π1 (Q, I2 ) ։ π1 (Q, I0 ). Notice also that one can build similar examples for
any non zero value p of car(k) by taking for Q a sequence of p bypasses.


3     Preliminaries on covering functors
In this section we give some useful facts on covering functors.

Lemma 3.1. Let p : E → B and q : E ′ → B be covering functors where E is connected.
Let r, r ′ : E → E ′ be such that q ◦ r = q ◦ r ′ = p. If there exists x0 ∈ E0 such that
r(x0 ) = r ′ (x0 ) then r = r ′ .

Proof: Since q is a covering functor, for any u ∈ y Ex \{0} we have:
   (r(x) = r ′ (x) or r(y) = r ′ (y)) ⇒ (r(u) = r ′ (u), r(x) = r ′ (x) and r(y) = r ′ (y)) (⋆)
Assume that there exists x0 ∈ E0 such that r(x0 ) = r ′ (x0 ). Since E is connected, for any
x ∈ E0 there exists a sequence x0 , . . . , xn = x of objects of E together with a non zero
morphism between xi and xi+1 for any i. This implies (thanks to (⋆)) that r(x) = r ′ (x).
Thus r and r ′ coincide on E0 , and (⋆) implies r = r ′ .                                    
    The following proposition generalises the result [17, Prop. 3.3]. Using Lemma 3.1
its proof is immediate.
Proposition 3.2. Let F : E → B be a covering functor where E is connected. Then
E is an Aut(F )-category. Moreover, F is a Galois covering if and only if Aut(F )
acts transitively on each F −1 (x). Finally, if F is Galois covering with group G, then
G = Aut(F ).
Proposition 3.3. Let p : E → B and q : F → E be functors where E is connected and
set r = p ◦ q : F → B. Then p, q, r are covering functors as soon as two of them are so.

Proof: Using basic linear algebra arguments, it is easy to verify the two following facts:
if p and q (resp. q and r) are covering functors then so is r (resp. p). If p and r are

                                                15
covering functors, then q satisfies the condition b) in the definition of a covering functor.
We only need to prove that q −1 (x) 6= ∅ for any x ∈ E0 . The condition b) implies that
q −1 (x) 6= ∅ ⇔ q −1 (y) 6= ∅ as soon as y Ex 6= 0. Since E is connected and q −1 (q(x)) 6= ∅
for any x ∈ F0 we deduce that q −1 (x) 6= ∅ for any x ∈ E0 .                               


Proposition 3.4. Let p : C → B (resp. q : C ′ → B) be a connected Galois covering with
group G (resp. G′ ) and assume there exists a commutative diagram of k-categories and
k-linear functors where ϕ is an isomorphism extending the identity map on B0 :
                                                       r    / C′
                                               C
                                               p                  q
                                                      ∼      
                                               B            /B
                                                       ϕ
Then there exists a unique mapping λ : G → G′ such that r ◦ g = λ(g) ◦ r for any g ∈ G.
Moreover λ is a surjective morphism of groups and r is a Galois covering with group
Ker(λ).

Proof: Thanks to Proposition 3.3, r is a covering functor. Fix x̂0 ∈ C and set x0 =
p(x̂0 ). For any g ∈ Aut(p) we have q(r(x̂0 )) = x0 = q(r(g(x̂0 ))). Since q is Galois
with group G′ , there exists a unique λ(g) ∈ G′ such that λ(g)(r(x̂0 )) = r(g(x̂0 )), and
Lemma 3.1 yields λ(g) ◦ r = r ◦ g. Hence: (∀g ∈ G) (∃!λ(g) ∈ G′ ) λ(g) ◦ r = r ◦ g.
This last property shows the existence and the uniqueness of λ. It also shows that
λ : G → G′ is a group morphism and that Aut(r) = Ker(λ). Moreover, λ is surjective
because of its definition and because p is Galois with group G. Finally, Proposition 3.2
shows that r is a Galois covering with group Ker(λ).                                   


4     The universal cover of an algebra
In this section we will prove Theorem 2. Let Q be a connected quiver without oriented
cycle and fix x0 ∈ Q0 for the computation of the groups π1 (Q, I). If there is no
ambiguity we shall write [w] for the homotopy class of a walk w.

Lemma 4.1. Let I be an admissible ideal of kQ, let D be a dilatation of kQ and set
                              ∼
J = D(I). Let λ : π1 (Q, I) − → π1 (Q, J) be the isomorphism given by Proposition 2.5.
             ˜ → (Q, I) (resp. q : (Q̂, Jˆ) → (Q, J)) be the universal Galois covering with
Let p : (Q̃, I)
                                                                                  ∼
group π1 (Q, I) (resp. π1 (Q, J)). Then there exists an isomorphism ψ : k Q̃/I˜ − → kQ̂/Jˆ
such that the following diagram commutes:
                                                       ψ
                                     kQ̃/I˜                 / k Q̂/Jˆ

                                                                     
                                                       D̄
                                    kQ/I        / kQ/J
where D̄, p̄ and q̄ are induced by D, p and q respectively.
Moreover, ψ satisfies: ψ ◦ g = λ(g) ◦ ψ for any g ∈ π1 (Q, I).

Proof: We have Q̂ = Q̃ since ∼I and ∼J coincide (see Proposition 2.5). Set D̂ : kQ̃ →
kQ̂ to be defined by: D̂(a, [w]) = (D(a), [w]) for any arrow (a, [w]) ∈ Q̃1 . By construc-
                                                                   ∼
                                           ˜ = Jˆ. Set ψ : k Q̃/I˜ −
tion D̂ is an automorphism of kQ and D̂(I)                         → kQ̂/Jˆ to be induced
by D̂. Then it is easy to check all the announced properties.                           

                                                       16
Lemma 4.2. Let I be an admissible ideal of kQ, let ϕ = ϕα,u,τ be a transvection,
set J = ϕ(I) and assume that α ∼J u. Let λ : π1 (Q, I) ։ π1 (Q, J) be the surjection
                                             ˜ → (Q, I) (resp. by q : (Q̂, J)
given by Proposition 2.5. Denote by p : (Q̃, I)                            ˆ → (Q, J))
the universal Galois covering with group π1 (Q, I) (resp. π1 (Q, J)). Then there exists
                             ∼
a Galois covering ψ : kQ̃/I˜ −
                             → kQ̂/Jˆ with group Ker(λ) and such that the following
diagram commutes:
                                                ψ
                                      kQ̃/I˜         / k Q̂/Jˆ

where ϕ̄, p̄ and q̄ are induced by ϕ, p and q respectively.
Moreover, ψ satisfies: ψ ◦ g = λ(g) ◦ ψ for any g ∈ π1 (Q, I).

Proof: Let ϕ′ : k Q̃ → kQ̂ be defined by: ϕ′ ([w]) = [w] for any [w] ∈ Q̃0 , ϕ′ (β, [w]) =
(β, [w]) for any (β, [w]) ∈ Q̃1 such that β 6= α, and ϕ′ (α, [w]) = (α, [w]) + τ (u, [w]) for
any (α, [w]) ∈ Q̃1 . Then ϕ′ is well defined since α ∼J u. Moreover, ϕ ◦ p(a) = q ◦ ϕ′ (a)
for any a ∈ Q̃1 , and ϕ′ (I)  ˜ ⊆ J. ˆ Let ψ : k Q̃/I˜ → kQ̂/Jˆ be induced by ϕ′ . Thus
q̄ ◦ ψ = ϕ̄ ◦ p̄. Let g = [γ] ∈ π1 (Q, I) and let [w] ∈ Q̃0 . Then ψ ◦ g([w]) = ψ([wγ −1 ]) =
[wγ −1 ] = λ(g)([w]) = λ(g) ◦ ψ([w]). The Lemma 3.1 implies that ψ ◦ g = λ(g) ◦ ψ
for any g ∈ π1 (Q, I). Finally, Proposition 3.4 gives: ψ is a Galois covering with group
Ker(λ).                                                                                     

Lemma 4.3. Let A be a basic and connected finite dimensional k-algebra with ordinary
quiver Q. Assume that k has characteristic zero and that Q has no double bypass. Let
∼I0 be the unique source of Γ and ∼I be a vertex of Γ. Then there exist a sequence
ϕ1 , . . . , ϕn (ϕi = ϕαi ,ui ,τi ) of transvections and a dilatation D such that:
     a) I = Dϕn . . . ϕ1 (I0 ),
     b) if Ii is the ideal ϕi . . . ϕ1 (I0 ) then αi ∼Ii ui .

Proof: We shall write [n] for the set {1, . . . , n}. Remark 2 implies that I = Dψ1 . . . ψm (I0 )
where the ψi ’s are transvections and D is a dilatation. Set J = D −1 (I) = ψ1 . . . ψm (I0 ).
Thus we only need to prove that the conclusion of Lemma 4.3 holds for J. Let Rm
be the property: “If J is the image of I0 by a product of m transvections, then there
exists a sequence ϕ1 , . . . , ϕn of transvections such that J = ϕn . . . ϕ1 (I0 ) and which sat-
isfies the property b) of Lemma 4.3”. Let us prove that Rm is true by induction on
m > 0. Obviously R0 is true, let m > 1 and let us assume that Rm−1 is true. Let
J = ψ1 . . . ψm (I0 ) where ψi = ϕai ,vi ,ti . Assume first that there exists i0 ∈ [m] such
that ai0 ∼J vi0 . Set J ′ = ψ1 . . . ψi0 −1 ψi0 +1 . . . ψm (I0 ). Thanks to Rm−1 , there exists a
sequence ϕ1 , . . . , ϕn of transvections such that J ′ = ϕn . . . ϕ1 (I0 ) and which satisfies the
property b) of Lemma 4.3. The sequence ϕ1 , . . . , ϕn , ψi0 shows that Rm is true when
such an i0 exists. Assume now that for any i ∈ [m] we have ai 6∼J vi . Let ϕ = ψm . . . ψ1 .
Lemma 2.10, applied to the data I0 , J, ϕ, shows that J = I0 . Hence Rm is true (with
n = 0) in this situation as well. This achieves the proof of Lemma 4.3.                          
    The following proposition shows how a Galois covering of locally bounded k-category
is induced by a covering of quivers with relations. Notice that this proposition makes
no assumption on the ordinary quiver of the involded k-categories (in particular, the
quiver may have loops, oriented cycles, multiple arrows...). It generalises [17, prop 3.4,
3.5]. The proof uses the ideas presented in [11, sect. 3].

are locally bounded. Then, there exist admissible presentations ϕ : kQ/I ′ −       → C and
            ∼
ψ : k Q̂/Iˆ −
            → Cˆ and a covering of quiver with relations p : (Q̂, I)
                                                                  ˆ → (Q, I ′ ), such that ϕ
restricts to the identity map Q0 = C0 → C0 on C0 and such that the following diagram
is commutative:
                                             ψ
                                      kQ̂/Iˆ     / ˆ

                                        kQ/I ′         /C
where p̄ is induced by p. If Cˆ is connected, then p is Galois with group G.

Proof: Using [7, Thm 3.8] we may assume that C is G-graded, that C ′ = C♯G and that
            F
C ′ = C♯G − → C is the natural projection. Since Cˆ and C are locally bounded, [6, 3.3]
implies that any morphism in RC is the sum of images (under F ) of morphisms in RC.             ˆ
                                                ˆ
Since the image under F of a morphism in C is a homogeneous morphism in C, we deduce
that the ideals RC and R2 C are homogeneous. Thus, for any x 6= y ∈ Q0 there exist
                             (1)       ( n )                                                  
homogeneous elements y ux , . . . , y uxy x of y RCx giving rise to a basis of y RC/R2 C x .
In particular, y nx is equal to the number of arrows x → y in Q. Let µ : kQ → C be
defined as follows: µ(x) = x for any x ∈ Q0 = C0 , and µ induces a bijection between the
                                   (1)           ( n )
set of arrows x → y of Q and {y ux , . . . , y uxy x } for any x 6= y ∈ Q0 . Set I ′ = Ker(µ).
                                                                           ∼
Hence I ′ is admissible and µ induces an isomorphism ϕ : kQ/I ′ −          → C. The following
construction of p uses the ideas of Green in [11, Sect. 3]. The k-category kQ is a G-
graded as follows: a path u in Q is homogeneous of degree the degree of µ(u). By using
the G-grading on C, it is easy to check that I ′ is homogeneous and that ϕ : kQ/I ′ → C
is homogeneous of degree 1G . Let Q̂ be the quiver as follows: Q̂0 = Q0 × G, and the
               α                                             α
arrows (x, s) −→ (y, t) in Q̂1 are exactly the arrows x −    → y in Q1 with degree t−1 s. Let
                                                          α
p : Q̂ → Q be defined by: p(x, s) = x and p((x, s) −      → (y, t)) = α for any (x, s) ∈ Q̂0 and
            α
           → (y, t) ∈ Q̂1 . Let Iˆ ⊆ Q̂ be the admissible ideal p−1 (I ′ ) of kQ̂. According
any (x, s) −
to [11, Sect. 3], p is a covering, and if Q̂ is connected then p is Galois with group
G. In particular p̄ : k Q̂/Iˆ → kQ/I ′ is a covering functor. Let ν : kQ̂ → C ′ = C♯G be
                                                                            α
as follows: ν(x, s) = (ϕ(x), s) for any (x, s) ∈ Q̂0 , and if (x, s) −     → (y, t) ∈ Q̂1 then
                             −1
                            t s =             ′
ν(α) = µ(p(α)) ∈ ϕ(y) Cϕ(x)         (ϕ(y),t) C(ϕ(x),s) . Therefore F ◦ ν = ϕ ◦ p, and since ϕ
is an isomorphism, we have Iˆ = Ker(ν). Let ψ : k Q̂/Iˆ → C ′ be induced by ν. Hence
ψ : Q̂0 → Cˆ0 is bijective, ψ is faithful and ϕ ◦ p̄ = F ◦ ψ. Moreover ψ is full because
p̄ and F are covering functors. Thus, ψ is an isomorphism. Finally, if C ′ is connected
then Q̂ is connected and this implies that p is a Galois covering with group G.                
    Recall from [4] that a triangular algebra is called simply connected if the fundamen-
tal group of any presentation of this algebra is trivial. A triangular algebra is simply
connected if and only if it has no proper connected Galois covering, see [19]. The follow-
ing corollary generalises this characterisation to non triangular algebras, it is a direct
consequence of Proposition 4.4

Corollary 4.5. Let A be a basic connected finite dimensional k-algebra. Then the
following assertions are equivalent:
   . for any admissible presentation kQ/I ≃ A we have π1 (Q, I) = 1,
   . A has no proper Galois covering C → A with C connected and locally bounded.

Remark 7. Proposition 4.4 does not necessarily hold when F is a covering functor and
not a Galois covering. As an example, set C = kQ where Q is equal to:

Set F : C′  → C to be defined by: F (b) = F (σb) = b, F (c) = F (σc) = c, F (a) = a and
F (σa) = a + cb. Then F is a covering functor. The group Aut(F ) is trivial therefore F
is not Galois, and F cannot be induced by any covering of bound quivers. Notice that
if F : C ′ → C is a covering functor and if the ordinary quiver of C has no bypass, then
F is induced by a covering of bound quivers.

Theorem 2. Assume that A satisfies the hypotheses made before stating Theorem 1.
Let ϕ0 : kQ/I0 ≃ A be an admissible presentation such that ∼I0 is the source of Γ.
                p0
Let (Q̃, I˜0 ) −→ (Q, I0 ) be the universal Galois covering with group π1 (Q, I0 ) and let

following diagram commutes:

Moreover, there is an exact sequence of groups: 1 → N → π1 (Q, I0 ) → G → 1.

Proof: Let C ′ −    → A be a connected Galois covering with group G. Thanks to Propo-
sition 4.4 we may assume that there exists a Galois covering (with group G) of bound
                    q
quivers (Q′ , I ′ ) −
                    → (Q, I) such that: A = kQ/I, C ′ = kQ′ /I ′ and F : C ′ → A is induced
                  ˆ − p
by q. Let (Q̂, I)     → (Q, I) be the universal Galois covering with group π1 (Q, I). Thus
                                                 ˆ − r
(see [17]) there exists a Galois covering (Q̂, I)   → (Q′ , I ′ ) such that q ◦ r = p. Hence we
have a commutative diagram (denoted by D):

Since ∼I0 is the source of Γ, Lemma 4.3 implies that there exist both a sequence of
transvections ϕ1 = ϕα1 ,u1 ,τ1 , . . . , ϕn = ϕαb ,un ,τn of kQ and a dilatation D such that
I = Dϕn . . . ϕ1 (I0 ) and such that αi ∼Ii ui if Ii = ϕi . . . ϕ1 (I0 ) for any i. Lemma 4.1
and Lemma 4.2 applied to D, I, In and ϕi , Ii−1 , Ii respectively yield the following com-

by the universal Galois covering (Q(i) , I (i) ) −→ (Q, Ii ) with group π1 (Q, Ii ). If we con-
nect T1 , . . . , Tn , D ′ and D we get the announced commutative diagram. Finally the
announced properties of F ′ are given by Proposition 3.4.                                    
Remark 8. Using the universal property in Theorem 2 it is easily verified that if there
exists a Galois covering C ′ → A such that C ′ is simply connected (i.e. the fundamental
group of any presentation of C ′ is trivial), then C ′ ≃ kQ̃/I˜0 .
    One may wish to use the more general framework of Galois categories (see [12])
in order to recover Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. Unfortunately this cannot be done in
general because the category of covering functors with finite fibre of A may not be a
Galois category as explained in the following example:
Example 4. Let A = kQ/I where Q is equal to

Hence the natural mapping p : (Q′ , I ′ ) → (Q, I) (x, σx 7→ x) is a Galois covering with
group G. Therefore, if we set A′ = kQ′ /I ′ , then p induces a Galois covering F : A′ → A
with group G. If u is a path in Q′ (resp. in Q) we will write u        b) for: umodI ′ ∈ A′

G as well and defined as follows:
    . F ′ (e
           a) = F ′ (f
                     σ a) = b   b
                            a + cb,
   . F ′ (e
          x) = F ′ (f      b for any x ∈ {b, c, d, e, f }.
                    σ x) = x

Assume that the category of the coverings of A with finite fibre is a Galois category.
Hence this category admits finite products and the product of F with F ′ gives rise to a
diagram:                                        C         @@

such that F ′′ = F ◦ p1 = F ′ ◦ p2 is a coveringS functor with fibre the product of the
fibres of F and F ′ . Hence C0 = Q′0 ×Q0 Q′0 = x∈Q0 {(x, x), (x, σx), (σx, x), (σx, σx)}.
Moreover, Proposition 3.3 implies that p1 and p2 are covering functors as well. Let us
compute the lifting u of ba ∈ 3 A1 w.r.t. F ′′ and with source (1, 1). Using the lifting
property of p1 and p2 we get:
   · p1 (u1 ) + p1 (u2 ) = e
                           a where u1 + u2 ∈     (σ3,3) C(1,1)   ⊕     (σ3,σ3) C(1,1) ,

   · p2 (v1 ) + p2 (v2 ) = e
                           a where v1 + v2 ∈   (3,σ3) C(1,1)   ⊕      (σ3,σ3) C(1,1) ,
                           e where v3 + v4 ∈
   · p2 (v3 ) + p2 (v4 ) = cb                   (σ3,3) C(1,1)    ⊕     (3,3) C(1,1) .

Since b       a) = F ′ (e
       a = F (e             e we infer that u = u1 + u2 = v1 + v2 − v3 − v4 . Therefore
                        a − cb),
v1 = v4 = 0, u1 = −v3 and u2 = v2 . Notice that v3 6= 0 and v2 6= 0 since e          a 6= 0 and
 e 6= 0. Therefore, the spaces (σ3,3) C(1,1) and (σ3,σ3) C(1,1) are non zero. Since p1 is a
cb
covering functor, we infer that p1 induces an inclusion (σ3,σ3) C(1,1) ⊕ (σ3,3) C(1,1) ֒→ σ3 A′1
of a space of dimension at least 2 in σ3 A′1 = k.e  a. This contradiction shows that the
product of F with F ′ does not exist and that the category of coverings of A with finite
fibre is not necessarily a Galois category.

    We end this study with a final remark concerning monomial algebras. Recall that
an algebra A is monomial if it admits a presentation kQ/I0 ≃ A where I0 is generated
by a set of paths. In such a case, π1 (Q, I0 ) ≃ π1 (Q) (the fundamental group of Q) and
therefore the fundamental group of any other presentation of A is a quotient of π1 (Q, I0 ).
Thus, Theorem 1 holds for A monomial without hypothesis on the characteristic of k
or on the double bypasses in Q. Hence we can wonder if Theorem 2 holds for monomial
algebras. This question will be studied in a subsequent text.
