     Abstract. Iwahori-Hecke algebras for the innite series of complex reection groups
     G(r; p; n) were constructed recently in the work of Ariki and Koike, Broue and Malle,
     and Ariki. In this paper we give Murnaghan-Nakayama type formulas for computing
     the irreducible characters of these algebras. Our method is a generalization of that
     in our earlier paper in which we derived Murnaghan-Nakayama rules for the charac-
     ters of the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of the classical Weyl groups. In both papers we
     have been motivated by C. Greene, who gave a new derivation of the Murnaghan-
     Nakayama formula for irreducible symmetric group characters by summing diagonal
     matrix entries in Young's seminormal representations. We use the analogous repre-
     sentations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of G(r; p; n) given by Ariki.



                                    1. Introduction
   The nite irreducible complex reection groups come in three innite families:
the symmetric groups Sn on n letters; the wreath product groups Zr o Sn , where
Zr denotes the cyclic group of order r; and a series of index-p subgroups G(r; p; n)
of Zr o Sn for each positive integer p that divides r. In the classication of nite
irreducible reection groups, besides these innite families Sn, Zr, and G(r; p; n),
there exist only 34 exceptional irreducible reection groups, see [ST].
   A formula for the irreducible characters of the Iwahori-Hecke algebras for Sn is
known [Ram], [KW], [vdJ]. This formula is a q-analogue of the classical Murnaghan-
Nakayama formula for computing the irreducible characters of Sn. Similar formulas
for the characters of the groups G(r; p; n) are classically known, see [Mac], [Ste],
[AK], [Osi] and the references there. Formulas of this type are also known for
   1991 Mathematics Subject Classication. Primary 20C05; Secondary 05E05.

the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of Weyl groups of types B and D [HR], [Pfe1], [Pfe2].
Recently, Iwahori-Hecke algebras have been constructed for the groups Zr o Sn and
G(r; p; n) [AK], [BM], [Ari]. In this paper we derive Murnaghan-Nakayama type
formulas for computing the irreducible characters of the Iwahori-Hecke algebras
that correspond to Zr o Sn and G(r; p; n).
   Hoefsmit [Hfs] has given explicit analogues of Young's seminormal representa-
tions for the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types An 1 , Bn, and Dn. Ariki and Koike,
[AK] and [Ari], have constructed \Hoefsmit-analogues" of Young's seminormal rep-
resentations for Iwahori-Hecke algebras Hr;p;n of the groups G(r; p; n). Our ap-
proach is to derive the Murnaghan-Nakayama rules by computing the sum of diag-
onal matrix elements in an explicit \Hoefsmit" representation of each algebra. We
are motivated by Curtis Greene [Gre], who takes this approach using the Young
seminormal form of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group and
gives a new derivation of the classical Murnaghan-Nakayama rule. Greene does
this by using the Mobius function of a poset that is determined by the partition
which indexes the irreducible representation. We generalize Greene's poset theorem
so that it works for our cases. In this way we are able to compute the characters
of the Hecke algebras Hr;n = Hr;1;n.
   To compute the characters of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra Hr;p;n of G(r; p; n),
p > 1, we use double centralizer methods (Cliord theory methods) to write these
characters in terms of a certain bitrace on the irreducible representations of Hr;n =
Hr;1;n. We then compute this bitrace in terms of the irreducible character values
of Hr;n .
   The character formulas given in this paper contain the Murnaghan-Nakayama
rules for the complex reection groups G(r; p; n) and the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of
classical type as special cases.
Remark. In this paper we only give formulas for computing the characters of
certain \standard elements" of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra which are given by (2.10)
in the case of the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of Zr o Sn and by (3.15) in the case of the
Iwahori-Hecke algebras of G(r; p; n), p > 1. In this paper we have not made any
eort to show that this is sucient to determine the values of the characters on all
elements. We have a method for proving this which will be given in another paper.
Results of this type for Iwahori-Hecke algebras of Weyl groups have been given in
[GP].



         2. Characters of Iwahori-Hecke Algebras of (Z=rZ) o Sn
   For positive integers r and n, let Sn denote the symmetric group of order n
generated by s2; s3 ; : : : ; sn , where si denotes the transposition si = (i 1; i), and
let Zr = Z=rZdenote the nite cyclic group of order r. Then the wreath product
group Zr o Sn is a complex reection group that can be identied with the group of
all n  n permutation matrices whose non-zero entries are rth roots of unity.
   Let q and u1; u2; : : : ; ur be indeterminates. Let Hr;n be the associative algebra
with 1 over the eld C (u1 ; u2; : : : ; ur ; q) given by generators T1 ; T2; : : : ; Tn and

Upon setting q = 1 and ui =  , where  is a primitive rth root of unity, one
                                   1
obtains the group algebra C [Zr o Sn]. The algebras Hr;n were rst constructed by
Ariki and Koike [AK], and they were classied as cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type
Bn by Broue and Malle [BM]. In the special case where r = 1 and u1 = 1, we have
T1 = 1, and H1;n is isomorphic to an Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type An 1 . The
case H2;n when r = 2, u1 = p, and u2 = p 1 , is isomorphic to an Iwahori-Hecke
algebra of type Bn.
Shapes and Standard Tableaux.
   As in [Mac], we identify a partition  with its Ferrers diagram and say that a
box b in  is in position (i; j ) in  if b is in row i and column j of . The rows and
columns of  are labeled in the same way as for matrices.                     
   An r-partition of size n is an r-tuple,  = (1); (2); : : : ; (r) of partitions
such that j(1)j + j(2)j +    + j(r)j = n. If  =  (1);  (2); : : : ;  (r) is another
r-partition, we write    if  (i)  (i) for 1  i  r. In this case, we say that
= = ((1)= (1);  (2)=(2); : : : ; (r)= (r)) is an r-skew shape. We refer to r-skew
shapes and r-partitions collectively as shapes.                                    
   If  is a shape of size n, a standard tableau L = L(1); L(2); : : : ; L(r) of shape
 is a lling of the Ferrers diagram of  with the numbers 1; 2; : : : ; n such that
the numbers are increasing left to right across the rows and increasing down the
columns of each L(i). For any shape , let L() denote the set of standard tableaux
of shape  and, for each standard tableau L, let L(k) denote the box containing k
in L.
Representations.
   Dene the content of a box b of a (possibly skew) shape  = ((1); : : : ; (r)) by
                       ct(b) = uk q2(j i) ;   if b is in position (i; j ) in (k). (2:1)
For each standard tableau L of size n, dene the scalar (Ti )LL by
                            (Ti )LL = q ct(Lq(i 1)) ;
                                                1
                                                            for 2  i  n:         (2:2)
                                       1 ct(L(i))
Note that (Ti )LL depends only on the positions of the boxes containing i and i 1
in L.
   Let  = ((1); : : : ; (r)) be a (possibly skew) shape of size n, and for each stan-
dard tableau L 2 L(), let vL denote a vector indexed by L. Let V  be the
C (u1 ; : : : ; ur ; q )-vector space spanned by fvL j L 2 L()g, so that the vectors vL
form a basis of V  . Dene an action of Hr;n on V  by dening
                      T1vL = ct(L(1))vL ;
                                                                                    (2:3)

where si L is the same standard tableau as L except that the positions of i and i 1
are switched in si L. If si L is not standard, then we dene vsi L = 0.
   The following theorem is due to Young [You] for the symmetric group Sn, to
Hoefsmit [Hfs] for H1;n, and to Ariki and Koike [AK] for Hr;n , r  2.
Theorem 2.4. ([You],[Hfs],[AK]) The modules V , where  runs over all r-
partitions of size n, form a complete set of nonisomorphic irreducible modules for
Hr;n .
Hoefsmit Elements.
    Dene elements ti 2 Hr;n , for 1  i  n, by
                                 ti = Ti Ti 1    T2T1 T2    Ti 1 Ti:    (2:5)
To our knowledge, these elements were discovered by Hoefsmit in the case of the
Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type Bn and were rediscovered by Ariki and Koike for
Iwahori-Hecke algebras of Zr o Sn. For each standard tableau L of size n, dene the
scalar (ti)LL by
                              (ti)LL = ct(L(i));          for 1  i  n:      (2:6)
The following proposition is due to Hoefsmit for r = 1; 2 and to Ariki and Koike
for r > 2.
Proposition 2.7. ([Hfs], Prop. 3.3.3; [AK], Prop. 3.16) For 1  i  n, the action
of ti on a vector vL , where L is a standard tableau, is
                                          ti vL = (ti )LL vL :
Furthermore, these elements commute:

t1; t2 ; : : : ; tn is an abelian subalgebra, i.e., the ti commute.
Standard Elements.
    For 1  k < `  n and 0  i  r 1, dene

                                                        (i)
 and, for each 1  k  n, dene Rkk = (tk )i . We say that an Sn-sequence of length
 m is a sequence ~` = (`1; : : : ; `m ) satisfying 1  `1 < `2 <    < `m = n, and
 we say that a Zr-sequence of length m is a sequence ~i = (i1; : : : ; im ) satisfying
 0  ij  r 1 for each j . For an Sn-sequence ~` = (`1 ; : : : ; `m) and a Zr-sequence
~i = (i1; : : : ; im ), dene
                                   T~`~i = R1(i;`11) R`(i12+1
                                                           )            (im )

 For example, in H4;10 we have the standard element
                T(3(0;;42;;83;;10)
                               1)
                                   = R(0) 1;3 R4;4 R5;8 R9;10 = T2 T3 (t4 ) (t5 ) T6 T7 T8 t9 T10 :

    For 1  k < `  n and 0  i  r 1, we dene

 and for 1  k  n, we dene (kki)(L) = (tk )iLL . Since (Tj )LL depends only on the
 positions of the boxes j and j 1 in L, the scalar (k`i)(L) depends only on the
 positions of the boxes containing k; k + 1; : : : ; ` in L.

Proposition 2.12. Let ~` = (`1 ; : : : ; `m) be an Sn-sequence and ~i ~= (i1 ; : : : ; im )
be a Zr-sequence, and let L be a standard tableau of size n. Let T~`i vL vL denote
the coecient of vL in T~`~i vL . Then
                           
                 T~`~i vL vL = (1i;`1)1 (L)`(i12+1               (im)

                                                   )

                                                                         
In particular, for given sequences ~` and ~i, the value T~`~i vL vL depends only on the
positions and the linear order of the boxes in L.
Proof. This follows from the denition of the action of Hr;n on standard tableaux
and the fact (2.3) that when Ti acts on a standard tableau L it aects only the
positions of L containing i and i 1. The result follows, since tj acts as a scalar
(Prop. 2.7), and T~`~i otherwise is a product (from right to left) of a decreasing
sequence of generators Ti .
Characters.
  If L is a standard tableau (of any shape, possibly of skew shape) with n boxes,
dene
                               (i)(L) = (1i;n) (L);                      (2:13)
and for any shape  (possibly skew), dene
                                        X (i)
                            (i)() =           (L):                      (2:14)
                                                     L2L()
In making these denitions, the actual values in the boxes of L do not matter,
only their positions and their order relative to one another are relevant. Thus, the
denitions make sense when the standard tableaux have values that form a subset
of f1; 2; : : : g (with the usual linear order).
   For an r-partition , let Hr;n denote the character of the irreducible Hr;n -
representation V  determined in Theorem 2.4. The following theorem is our ana-
logue of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule.
Theorem 2.15. Let ~` = (`1 ; : : : ; `m) be an Sn -sequence, ~i = (i1 ; : : : ; im ) be a
Zr-sequence, and suppose that  is an r-partition of size n. Then
                          X
Hr;n (T~`~i ) =                    (i1)((1))(i2)((2)=(1))    (im)((m)=(m 1));

that j(j)=(j 1)j = j`j j.
Proof. By Proposition 2.12 the character  Hr;n is given by

                                                                              ;`2 (L)    `m 1+1;`m (L):

    In view of Theorem 2.15 it is desirable to give an explicit formula for the value
of (i)(). To do so requires some further notations: The shape  is a border strip
if it is connected and does not contain two boxes which are adjacent in the same
northwest-to-southeast diagonal. This is equivalent to saying that  is connected
and does not contain any 2  2 block of boxes. The shape  is a broken border strip
if it does not contain any 2  2 block of boxes. Therefore, a broken border strip is
a union of connected components, each of which is a border strip.
    Drawing Ferrers diagrams as in [Mac], we say that a sharp corner in a border
strip is a box with no box above it and no box to its left. A dull corner in a border
strip is a box that has a box to its left and a box above it but has no box directly
northwest of it. The picture below shows a broken border strip with two connected
components where each of the sharp corners has been marked with an s and each
of the dull corners has been marked with a d.

   The following theorem is proved using Corollary 4.14 of Theorem 4.6. We have
placed these results in Section 4, because they stand on their own as results on
planar posets.
Theorem 2.17. Let  be any shape (possibly skew) with n boxes. Let CC be the
set of connected components of , and let cc = jCCj be the number of connected
components of .

the number of columns in bs. The content ct(b) of a box b is as given in (2.1).
The function et (ct(DC)) is the elementary symmetric function in the variables
fct(d); d 2 DCg, and the function hk t cc (ct(SC)) is the homogeneous symmetric
function in the variables fct(s); s 2 SCg.
Proof. Recall from (2.2) that


                              (Tk )LL = q ct(Lq(k 1)) :
                                                   1

                                        1 ct(L(k))
It follows from the denitions of (k)(L) in (2.13) and (2.14) that we may apply
Corollary 4.14 with xb = ct(b) for all boxes b in .
   For two boxes a and b in  that are adjacent in a diagonal, we have
                          1 ct(a)ct(b) 1 = 1 1 = 0:
                              (q q 1 )        q q 1
Thus, (k)() = 0 if  is not a broken border strip. Furthermore,
                      (    (q q 1) = q;         if a and b are adjacent in a row,
      (q q 1 ) =            1 q 2
  1 ct(a)ct(b) 1        (q q 1) = q 1; if a and b are adjacent in a column.
                          1 q2
The result now follows from Corollary 4.14.


         3. Characters of Iwahori-Hecke Algebras of G(r; p; n)
   In this section we dene the complex reection groups G(r; p; n) and their Iwahori-
Hecke algebras Hr;p;n. The groups G(r; p; n) are normal subgroups of index p in the
groups G(r; 1; n), and the groups G(r; 1; n) are isomorphic to the wreath products
Zr o Sn . The corresponding Hecke algebras Hr;p;n are subalgebras of Hr;n . We
compute the irreducible characters of Hr;p;n in terms of the irreducible characters
of Hr;n , which are computed in Section 2.
The Complex Reection Groups (                      G r; p; n ).
   Let r; p; d; and n be positive integers such that pd = r. The complex reection
group G(r; p; n) is the set of n  n matrices such that
 (a) The entries are either 0 or rth roots of unity.
 (b) There is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column.
  (c) The dth power of the product of the nonzero entries is 1.
The order of G(r; p; n) is given by jG(r; p; n)j = drn 1 n!; and G(r; p; n) is a normal
subgroup of G(r; 1; n) of index p.
   Let  = e2i=r be a primitive rth root of unity. Then G(r; p; n) is generated by
the elements
                                  X
                                  n                                          X
                                                                             n
             s0 =  pE11 +            Eii ;         s1 = E12 +  1E21 +           Eii ;
                                  i=2                                        i=3
                      X
             sj =                Eii + E(j    1)j   + Ej(j   1)   ;   2  j  n;
                    i6=j;j   1
8                           T. HALVERSON AND A. RAM
where Eij denotes the n  n matrix with a 1 in the ith row and j th column and
with all other entries 0.
Example 3.1. The following are important special cases of G(r; p; n).
 (1) G(1; 1; n) = Sn, the symmetric group.
 (2) G(r; 1; n) = Zr o Sn.
 (3) G(2; 1; n) = WBn the Weyl group of type B.
 (4) G(2; 2; n) = WDn the Weyl group of type D.
The Hecke algebras.
   Let " = e2i=p be a primitive pth root of unity, and let q and x10=p ; : : : ; x1d=p1
be indeterminates. Then Hr;n is the associative algebra with 1 over the eld
    1=p          1=p
C (x0 ; : : : ; xd 1 ; q ) given by generators T1 ; : : : ; Tn ; and relations
   (1) Ti Tj = Tj Ti,                                           for ji j j > 1,
   (2) Ti Ti+1Ti = Ti+1Ti Ti+1,                                 for 2  i  n 1,
   (3) T1 T2T1 T2 = T2 T1T2 T1,
   (4) (T1p x0)(T1p x1 )    (T1p xd 1 ) = 0,
   (5) (Ti q)(Ti + q 1) = 0,                                    for 2  i  n.
This is the same as the denition of the algebra Hr;n in section 2 except that we
are using "`x1k=p , 0  k  d 1, 0  `  p 1, in place of u1; : : : ; ur . Let Hr;p;n be
the subalgebra of Hr;n generated by the elements
                 a0 = T1p; a1 = T1 1 T2T1 ; and ai = Ti ; 2  i  n:               (3:2)
Ariki ([Ari], Proposition 1.6) shows that Hr;p;n is an analogue of the Iwahori-
Hecke algebra for the groups G(r; p; n). The special case H2;2;n is isomorphic to an
Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Dn .
Shapes and Tableaux.
   As above, r; p; d; and n are positive integers such that pd = r. We organize each
r-partition  of size n into d groups of p partitions each, so that we can write
                  = ((k;`)); for 0  k  d 1 and 0  `  p 1;
                                            P
where each (k;`) is a partition and k;` j(k;`)j = n. It is convenient to view
the partitions (k;0); : : : ; (k;p 1) as all lying on a circle so that we have d neck-
laces of partitions, each necklace with p partitions on it. In order to specify this
arrangement, we shall say that  is a (d; p)-partition.
   As in section 2, we let L() denote the set of standard tableaux of shape , and,
for each standard tableau L, let L(i) denote the box containing i in L.
Action on Standard Tableaux.
   Let  = ((k;`)) be a (d; p)-partition of size n. Since Hr;p;n is a subalgebra
of Hr;n, the irreducible Hr;n -representations V  are (not necessarily irreducible)
representations of Hr;p;n. However we can easily describe the action of Hr;p;n on
V  by restricting the action of Hr;n.
            CHARACTERS OF IWAHORI-HECKE ALGEBRAS OF G(r; p; n)                          9
   With the given specializations of the ui, the content of a box b of , see (2.1), is
              ct(b) = "`x1k=p q2(j i);        if b is in position (i; j ) in (k;`).
As in Section 2, we dene, for each standard tableau L of size n, the scalar
                      (Ti )LL = q ct(Lq(i 1)) ;
                                               1
                                                           for 2  i  n:
                                  1 ct(L(i))
From (2.3) and (3.2), it follows that the action of Hr;p;n on V  is given by
                  a0 vL = ct(L(1))p vL = xk vL ; if 1 2 L(k;`);
                  a1 vL = (T2 )LL vL + ct(   ct(L(1)) (q 1 + (T ) )v ;               (3:3)
                                                                    2 LL s2 L
                                               s2 L(1))
                  ai vL = (Ti )LL vL + (q 1 + (Ti )LL )vsi L :
Recall that ti = Ti    T2 T1T2    Ti for 1  i  n, and dene elements Si 2 Hr;p;n,
1  i  n, by
         S1 = a0 = tp1 ;
         S2 = a1 a2 = t1 1t2 ;
         Si = ai ai 1    a4a3 a1 a2a3 a4    ai 1 ai = t1 1ti ; for 3  i  n.
It follows from the action of the ti (Prop. 2.7) that the action of Si on V  is also
diagonal and is given by
                              S1vL = ct(L(1))p vL
                                                                                     (3:4)
                               SivL = ct(L(1)) 1 ct(L(i))vL :
Furthermore, since the ti commute (Prop. 2.8), it follows that the Si commute.
A Z=pZaction on shapes.
   Let  = ((k;`)) be a (d; p)-partition. We dene an operation  that moves the
partitions on each circle over one position. Given a box b in position (i; j ) of the
partition (k;`) then (b) is the same box b except moved to be in position (i; j )
of (k;`+1), where ` + 1 is taken modulo p. The map  is an operation of order p
and acts uniformly on the shape  = ((k;`)), on standard tableaux L = (L(k;`)) of
shape , and on the basis vector vL of V :
             () = ((k;`+1)); (L) = (L(k;`+1)); and (vL ) = v(L) :
We use the notation  in each case, since the operation is always clear from context.
In the last case, extend linearly to get the vector space homomorphism : V  !
V (): If b is a box in a shape , then
                                    ct((b)) = "ct(b):                          (3:5)
Lemma 3.6. The map : V  ! V () is a Hr;p;n -module isomorphism, i.e., 
commutes with the action of Hr;p;n.
Proof. Since (Ti )LL , see (2.2), depends only on the row and column of boxes i and
i 1 and not on the position of the tableaux, we have (Ti )L;L = (Ti )LL , for all
10                            T. HALVERSON AND A. RAM
1  i  n and all standard tableaux L. Since (s2 L) = s2(L), it follows that
ai vL = (ai vL ): (Note that, because " is a pth root of unity, T1 does not commute
with  but that a0 does.)

denes an action of the cyclic group Z=pZon the set of (d; p)-partitions and on the
set of vector spaces V .
Irreducible Representations.
   Fix a (d; p)-partition  of size n, and let K be the stabilizer of  under the
action of Z=pZ. The group K is a cyclic group of order jKj and is generated by
the transformation f where f is the smallest integer between 1 and p such that
f () = . Thus,
                     K = ff : V  ! V  j 0    jK j 1g:               (3:7)

irreducible K-modules are all one-dimensional, and the characters of these modules
are given explicitly by

proved that they form a complete set of irreducible Hr;p;n-modules. From the point
of view of (3.10), one can prove that the V (;j) are irreducible Hr;p;n -modules by
setting q = 1 and xk = 1 for all 0  k  d 1 and appealing to the corresponding
result for the group G(r; p; n).

Theorem 3.11. ([Ari], Theorem 2.6) The modules V (;j), where  runs over all
r-partitions and 0  j  jKj 1, form a complete set of nonisomorphic irreducible
modules for Hr;p;n.
Remark 3.12. It should be noted that if f = p and thus jKj = 1, then the
irreducible Hr;n-module V  is also an irreducible Hr;p;n-module.

where hf vL vL denotes the coecient of vL in the expansion of hf vL in terms

   Recall the denition (2.9) of the element R(m;`i) of H . We now show that it is

Lemma 3.17. For a word g = Ti1 1    Tim1 in the generators of Hr;n (i.e., an
element of the group in Hr;n generated by the Ti ), let  (g) denote the number of

                                      (ghg 1f ) = " f (g)(hf ):
Proof. First note that, by Lemma 3.16, ghg
                                                                       1 2 H

sider the bitrace. Then
                                         (ghg 1f ) = (hg 1f g):
We must be very careful here, because, although the action of h commutes with
the action of f , the action of g and g 1 do not. In fact, since
  (1) T1vL = ct(L(1))vL = "ct(L(1))vL = "(T1 vL ), and
  (2) TivL = (Ti vL ), for 2  i  n, by Lemma 3.6, and
it follows that g 1f = " f (g)f g 1 . Thus,

Proof. We have

Since t1 commutes with Ti for i > 2 it follows that, for any Sn -sequence (`1; : : : ; `m )
and Zr-sequence (i1 ; : : : ; im ), we have
 S~1i1`1 S`(1i2+1) ;`2    S`(mim)1+1;`m = ti11p 1T2 t11 i2  im T3    T`1 R(`i12+1        )             (im )

Both of these can be conjugated by a power of t1 to give
                                      R1(i;`11p i2  im )R`(i12+1

Now use Lemma 3.17.

Lemma 3.24. Let the notations be as in Theorem 3.19. If hvL v                      L   6= 0; then
  (a) L is -laced and
  (b) every `i in the sequence (`1 ; : : : ; `m ) is divisible by  .
Proof. (a) Because of the special form of h the basis elements that appear in hvL are
of the form vwL , where w = sj1    sjk is a product of sj such that j1 < j2 <    < jk
is a subset of the sequence f2; 3; : : : ; `1; `1 + 2; `1 + 3; : : : ; `2; `2 + 2; : : : g.
                                    
    This means that, in cycle notation,       w is a product of cycles of the form (i; i +
                                    
1; i +2; : : : ; j 1; j ). Thus, hvL v L 6= 0 only if   L = wL for some permutation
of this form. But any permutation  such that L =   L must have                    all cycles of
                                                                                 
length  , it follows that w = w1 as given in (3.21). Thus, if hvL v L 6= 0, then
w1L =   L and so L is -laced.
    (b) By the proof of (a), w1 = sj1    sjk where j1 < j2 <    < jk is a subset of
the sequence of factors f2; 3; : : : ; `1; `1 +2; `1 +3; : : : ; `2; `2 +2; : : : g. This fact and
the explicit form of w1 in (3.21) implies that each `i must be divisible by  .
\Dividing by  ".
   Keeping the notations as in Theorem 3.19, let us now assume that the sequence
(`1;    ; `m ) is such that `i is divisible by  for all i.
   Let                                           Y
                                         wj =         si ;                 (3:25)

                                                       -(i 1)
where the product is taken with the si in increasing order and over all i  j such
that i 1 is not divisible by  . Note that with this denition w1 is the same as
given in (3.21) and that w1L =   L if hvLv L 6= 0. In fact, it follows from the

We shall compute the values of the Fj (L) explicitly in Lemma 3.30, but rst we
must introduce a bit more notation.
    Recall the denitions of n, r, p, (`1 ; : : : ; `m); , and h in Theorem 3.19. If L
is a -laced tableau dene integers 1; : : : ; n and a (d; p) standard tableau L as
follows:
      If L(m ) is in position (i; j ) of the partition (k;mp+m), then
         L (m) is in position (i; j ) of the partition (k;m).
In the above m and m are chosen such that 0  m  p 1.
    The map
                                    L 7 ! (1 ; : : : ; n ; L )
is a bijection between -laced tableaux L and sequences (1 ; : : : ; n ; L ) where 0 
m   1 for each 1  m  n= , and L is a (d; p)-standard tableau. The following

                       L 7 ! (1; : : : ; n ; L ) 7 ! (d1 ; : : : ; dn ; L );

dm   1 for each 1  m  n , and L is a (d; p)-standard tableau.
   The reason for introducing these bijections will become more clear in the proof
of the following lemma. First let us dene

if m is in position (i; j ) of the partition (k;m) of L and then note that
                     ct(L(m )) = "mpct(L (m)) = !m ct(L (m));                 (3:29)
where ! = "p is a primitive  -th root of unity.
Lemma 3.30. Let the notations be as given in Theorem 3.19 and assume that
 = f, that L is a -laced standard tableau, and that the sequence (`1; : : : ; `m )
is such that `i is divisible by  for all i. Let ! = "p = e2i= , and let Fj (L)
denote the factor dened in (3.26). Let 1  j  n and suppose that k is such that

Proof.   (a) If j 1 is not divisible by  then wj+1L(j 1) = L(j 1) and wj+1L(j ) =

It follows that

                                                                   1

                               4. The Poset Theorem
    Curtis Greene [Gre] uses the theory of partially ordered sets (posets) and Mobius
functions to prove a rational function identity ([Gre], Theorem 3.3) which can
be used to derive the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for symmetric group charac-
ters. In [HR], we modify Greene's theorem so that it can be applied to computing
Murnaghan-Nakayama rules for the irreducible characters of the Iwahori-Hecke al-
gebras of type An 1; Bn, and Dn. In this section, we extend the poset theorem of
[HR] so that it can be applied to computing Murnaghan-Nakayama rules (Theorem
2.17) for the irreducible characters of the cyclotomic Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type
B.
    A poset is planar in the (strong) sense if its Hasse diagram may be order-
embedded in R  R without edge crossings even when extra bottom and top el-
ements are added (see [Gre] for details). A linear extension of a poset P is a poset
L with the same underlying set as P and such that the relations in L form an
extension of the relations in P to a total order. We will denote by L(P ) the set of
all linear extensions L of P .
    The Mobius function of a poset P is the function  : P  P ! Z dened
inductively for elements a; b 2 P by
                                        (        1                if a = b,
                                           P
                 (a; b) = P (a; b) =        ax<b(a; x)       if a < b,       (4:1)

(See [Sta] for more details on Mobius functions).
    Throughout this section, P^ will denote a planar poset with unique minimal
element u, and P = P^ fug will be the poset obtained by removing the minimal
element u from P^ . We let SC be the set of minimal elements of P , and we call
these elements sharp corners. Two sharp corners s1 and s2 of SC are \adjacent" if
they are not separated by another sharp corner as the boundary of P is traversed.
If s1 and s2 are adjacent elements of SC and the least common multiple s1 _ s2
exists, then we call s1 _ s2 a dull corner of P . We let DC denote the set of all dull
corners of P . Finally, we let cc denote the number of connected components of P ,
and note that cc = jSCj jDCj.
    Let fxa ; a 2 P^ g, be a set of commutative variables indexed by the elements of
P^ . For each 0  k  r 1 and each pair a < b in P^ , dene a weight, wt(k)(a; b), by
                      wt(k)(a; b) = 1 q xaqxb1 for all a; b 2 P; and

The expansion in (4.5) is equal to zero if there is more than one connected compo-

  The following is our extension of the poset theorem to include values of k > 1.
Theorem 4.6. Let P^ be a planar poset (as dened above) with unique minimal
element u. Let P = P^ n fug. Then
                                     X

                                                                   jX
                                                                    DCj
                                                                           ( 1)t et(xDC )hk t cc (xSC )

where cc is the number of connected components of P , et(xDC ) is the elementary
symmetric function in the variables fxd ; d 2 DCg, and hk t cc(xSC ) is the homo-
geneous symmetric function in the variables fxs ; s 2 SCg.
Proof.  For each s 2 SC dene P^s to be the same poset as P^ except with the
additional relations s  s0 , for s 6= s0 2 SC, and all other relations implied by
transitivity. Each poset Ps is planar, and each linear extension of Ps must place
the sharp corner s (a minimal element of P ) immediately after u in the ordering,
so we have
     X                         X X                                     X                            X
              (k)(L^ ) =                           (k)(L^ s ) =               wt(k)(u; s)   1
                                                                                                               (k)(Ls );
 L^ 2L(P^ )                    s2SC L^ s 2L(P^s )                      s2SC                       Ls 2L(Ps )

In P we have wt(k)(a; b) = wt(0)(a; b), so by [HR], Theorem 5.3, the second sum
can be computed as
                       X                              X
                                  (k)(Ls ) =                    (0)(Ls ) = (0) = (k)(Ps );
                    Ls 2L(Ps)                       Ls 2L(Ps )

since Ps is connected. Moreover, wt(0)(u; s)                            1   = 1 for each s 2 SC, so the case
k = 0 is proved.

where Pi (a; b) and P (a; b) are the Mobius functions for their respective posets.
   We use the work of Greene [Gre] to compute the dierences Ps (a; b) P (a; b)
for a < b 2 P . Let P  and Ps denote the dual of P and Ps , respectively (that is
u P  v , v P u). Then, P (u; v) = P  (v; u) (see [Sta], p. 120), so we want to
compute
                       Ps (b; a) P  (b; a) for a < b 2 P:
    Using the Mobius notation of [Gre] (p. 8, formulas (7) and (8)), let
                             X                                                     X
                     a =             P  (t; a)t;        and          a(s) =             Ps (t; a)t;
                            tP  a                                               tPs a
so that                                  X                                    X
                                a=                t ;     and          a=             t(s):
                                        tP  a                              tPs a

In this way, a(s) = a for all a 2 P  n SC, and
                                                           X                 X

It follows that

Shapes and Standard Tableaux.                        P
  Theorem 4.6 reduces the problem of computing L^ 2L(P^) (k)(L^ ) to computing
(k)(P ). In the case where P is the poset of a (skew) shape, the product (k)(P ) is
24                         T. HALVERSON AND A. RAM
readily computed and has been done so for q = 1 by Green [Gre] and for generic q
in [HR]. The result uses the natural extension of the theory of shapes and tableaux
to the theory of partially ordered sets. (For a full treatment of this subject, see
[Sta], whose notation we use here).
   If  is a shape (possibly skew), then we construct a corresponding poset P
whose Hasse diagram is given by placing a node in each box of  and then drawing
edges connecting nodes in adjacent boxes. The order relation in this poset is so
that the smallest nodes are in the upper left corners. For example,

                 $                        and                   $

                                     Figure 4.11
  Note that posets corresponding to shapes are always planar and that the sharp
and dull corners that we dened for partitions and shapes (see Figure 2.19) are
exactly the sharp and dull corners of the corresponding poset.

   Let  be a shape (or a skew shape) and let L() be the set of standard tableaux
of shape . Linear extensions of the poset P are in one-to-one correspondence with
standard tableaux having skew shape  as follows: Given a standard tableau T of
shape  let T (k) denote the box containing k in T . Then the standard tableau T
corresponds to the linear extension L of the poset P which has underlying set P
and order relations given by T (k) L T (l) if k  l. We can identify the standard
tableau T with the chain L.

 with the linear extensions of the poset P. Thus, we can identify a standard tableau
 T of shape  with a linear extension L^ of the poset P^.
    Let  be the Mobius function of the linear extension L^ of P^ that corresponds
 to the standard tableau T of shape . Then, since L^ is a chain,  satises
                       (

 where
 cc is the number of connected components of ,
SC is the set of sharp corners of ,
DC is the set of dull corners of ,
 R is the set of pairs (a; b) of boxes in  adjacent (west to east) in a row,
 C is the set of pairs (a; b) of boxes in  adjacent (north to south) in a column, and
 D is the set of pairs (a; b) of boxes in  adjacent (northwest to southeast) in a
     diagonal.
 Proof. Let P be the poset of the shape , and let P  ^ be the poset P [ fug, where
 the adjoined element u satises u  a for all a 2 P . Then P^ is aPplanar poset with
 unique minimal element, so we apply Theorem 4.6 to compute T 2L()(k)(T ) =
 P
    L^ 2L(P^ ) (L^ ). This reduces the problem to computing  (P ). Inside of P ,
                (k)                                              (k)

 the weights (4.2) are all independent of k and of the form (4.13), so we use Theorem
 4.12 to compute (k)(P ).
