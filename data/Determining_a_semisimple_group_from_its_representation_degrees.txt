                                                   The Lie algebra of a compact semisimple Lie group G is determined by the degrees of

                                                the irreducible representations of G. However, two different groups can have the same

                                                representation degrees.



                                            0. Introduction

                                              A compact semisimple Lie group G has a finite number of representations of
                                            any given degree. In this paper we investigate to what extent G is determined
                                            by the multi-set of degrees of its representations or equivalently, the multi-set
                                            of degrees of its irreducible representations. This problem arises naturally in at
                                            least two different ways. On the one hand, following Witten [7], we define the
                                            zeta-function ζG (s) of a compact semisimple Lie group as the Dirichlet series
                                                                                         X
                                                                          ζG (s) =               (dim V )−s .
                                                                                     V irreducible

                                            The question in this paper then belongs to the familiar class of problems asking
                                            when two different mathematical objects can have the same zeta-function. On
                                            the other hand, the multi-set of degrees of the irreducible representations of
                                            G comprises a (small) part of the data encoded in the representation category
                                            RepC G. We know [2] that the full structure of neutral Tannakian category on
                                            RepC G enables us to recover the complexification GC of G and therefore G itself
                                            (as a maximal compact subgroup of GC ). For semisimple groups, though, there
                                            are results (see for instance, [5]) showing that RepC G has more data than we
                                            need to determine G. In this paper we are asking whether the C-linear abelian
                                            category with fiber functor underlying RepC G already determines G.

 The main theorem of this paper is that ζG (s) determines the Lie algebra of
G up to isomorphism. Our basic tool is the Weyl dimension formula, which
expresses the dimension of each irreducible representation of a group G as a
product over the set of positive roots of G. We try to recover the geometry of
the root system of G from the factorizations of the representation degrees, the
basic difficulty being that there are many ways to factor a given degree. Our
strategy is to choose values of n which have few factorizations or at least few
factorizations which could possibly arise from Weyl’s formula.
  The simplest idea is to consider prime powers n = pk . It is an easy consequence
                                               +
of Weyl’s formula that dim Vpλ+(p−1)ρ = p|R | dim Vλ , where Vλ is the irreducible
representation of G of highest weight λ, R+ is the set of positive roots of G,
and ρ is the half-sum of the elements of R+ . An elaboration of this argument,
given in §1, shows that the prime power coefficients determine the number of
irreducible factors of R and the number of roots in each factor. Unfortunately,
there are infinitely many pairs of distinct irreducible root systems with the same
number of roots, and prime power coefficients alone are in general insufficient to
disambiguate further. For example, SO(15) and PSp(14) both have the property
that the number of their irreducible representations of degree pk is 1 if k ∈ 49Z
and 0 otherwise (for p ≫ 0, this follows from the discussion in §1, but a computer
search is needed to confirm it for small primes.)
  We therefore broaden our search to encompass degrees n in which the largest
power of some prime p dividing n is not too much smaller than n. To illustrate
this idea, we consider the case that R is irreducible, and exclude weights λ with
λ + ρ divisible by p (such weights are not “allowable at p” in the terminology
of this paper). We compare the size of the logarithm of the largest power of p
dividing dim Vλ to that of dim Vλ itself and prove that
                             − log | dim Vλ |p                     log p ordp dim Vλ
(0.0.1)   lim      sup                         = lim     sup
          p→∞ λ6=0 allowable   log dim Vλ       p→∞ λ6=0 allowable     log dim Vλ
approaches a rational limit strictly between 0 and 1 which depends on R. This
limit is the efficiency of R (defined in §3 directly in terms of the geometry of
R). A more efficient root system always has allowable representation degrees
which cannot be achieved by an allowable weight of a less efficient system. Once
the efficiency is known, we can begin studying the families of representations
(indexed by p) whose degrees achieve it. It turns out the optimal ones, in a
sense made explicit below, lie in finitely many one parameter families of the form

                                           2
p 7→ pµ + ν. For each such family, the degree is given as a polynomial in p, the
“Weyl polynomial” associated to µ and ν. The Weyl polynomials of a simple
root system encode enough information, ultimately, to extract the root system
giving rise to them.
   The process of excluding non-allowable representations is carried out in §1 and
is somewhat delicate; because our groups may not be products of almost simple
factors, we must restrict attention to primes which are congruent to 1 modulo a
sufficiently divisible integer. Weyl polynomials are introduced in §2 and the basic
pairs (µ, ν) used in the proof of the main theorem are given. The computation
of efficiencies occupies much of §3 and is rather involved. There does not seem
to be a simple formula for the answer: for instance, the efficiency of E8 turns
          63
out to be 117 . The proof of the main theorem, by means of a rather complicated
induction on the number of factors, is given in §4.
  To show that our result is in some sense sharp, in §5 we give a construction
of pairs of non-isomorphic compact semisimple Lie groups with the same Wit-
ten zeta-function. This construction is modelled on a well known theorem of
F. Gassmann [3] asserting that the Dedekind zeta-function ζK (s) of a number
field K does not determine K up to isomorphism. The proof of Gassmann’s
theorem is purely group-theoretic. Namely, there exists a finite group G with
subgroups H1 and H2 , not conjugate in G, whose elements can be put into one-
to-one correspondence in such a way that corresponding elements are conjugate
in G. The fixed fields of H1 and H2 in a Galois extension with group G then
have the same zeta-function. T. Sunada [6] used the same trick to construct
pairs of non-isometric isospectral manifolds; here π1 plays the role of the Galois
group. Like Sunada, we exploit π1 , but our fundamental groups are abelian, so
there are no inner automorphisms to work with. Instead we make use of outer
automorphisms. We construct subgroups H1 and H2 of a suitable π1 (G), whose
elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence in such a way that corre-
sponding elements always lie in the same orbit of Aut(π1 (G)) but such that the
groups H1 and H2 as a whole do not. The corresponding covering groups can
then be shown to have the same representation degrees.
  This work was initiated during a visit to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in
the summer of 2002. I would like to thank the Einstein Institute of Mathematics
for its hospitality during this visit.

1. Modifying the zeta-function

  Let G be a compact semisimple group, G̃ its universal cover, and G1 , . . . , Gm
the almost simple direct factors of G. Let ΛG and ΛG̃ denote the weight lattices
of G and G̃ respectively, so

                            [ΛG̃ : ΛG ] = | ker(G̃ → G)|.

We write Vλ for the irreducible representation of G̃ with highest weight λ; we
can regard Vλ as a G-representation if and only if λ ∈ ΛG , and all irreducible
representations of G arise in this way. We have a direct sum decomposition
                                            m
                                            M
                                   ΛG̃ =          ΛGi ,
                                            i=1


and we write λ = λ1 + . . . + λm . Thus λ is a dominant weight of G̃ if and only
if λi is a dominant weight of Gi for all i. There is a tensor decomposition

                               Vλ = Vλ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vλm .

Let R (resp. Ri ) denote the root system of G (resp. Gi ). We fix a positive Weyl
chamber of R (equivalently, positive Weyl chambers for each Ri .) For each root
                                    2α
α, we denote the dual root α∨ = kαk    2 , and we write ρ (resp. ρi ) for the half-sum

of positive roots in R (resp. Ri ). The Weyl dimension formula [1] VIII §9 Th. 2
asserts
                   Y α∨ (λ + ρ) Ym Y                 m
                                      α∨ (λi + ρi ) Y
          dim Vλ =             =                   =   dim Vλi .
                      α∨ (ρ)            α∨ (ρi )
                    +
                   α∈R              +    i=1 α∈R                        i=1
                                                   i


It follows that
                                                       +
(1.0.1)                  dim Vpλi +(p−1)ρi = p|Ri | dim Vλi .

Thus,                                                         P     +
                    dim V (pai −1)ρ1 +···+(pam −1)ρm       = p ai |Ri | .

Note that when p is odd, (pai − 1)ρi lies in the root lattice of Gi , so
                               m
                               X
                                      (pai − 1)ρi ∈ ΛG .
                                i=1

                                            4
Therefore, every coefficient of ζG (s) is greater than equal to the corresponding
coefficient of
                                m
                               Y             + −1
                                    1 − p−|Ri |s    .
                                i=1

We will see that for fixed G, when p ≫ 0 is a sufficiently large prime, the latter
expression gives precisely the part of the Dirichlet series ζG (s) consisting of p-
power terms.

Lemma 1.1: An irreducible root system R cannot be contained in the union of
two proper subspaces of Span R.

Proof: Let E = Span R and V and W proper subspaces such that R ⊂ V ∪ W .
We use induction on dim E, the lemma being trivial when dim E = 1. Replacing
V and W by Span (V ∩R) and Span (W ∩R) respectively, we may assume without
loss of generality that V ∩ R are W ∩ R are root systems with span V and W
respectively. If W ⊂ V , then R ⊂ V $ E = Span R, which is absurd; likewise, V
is not a subspace of W . If W ⊂ V ⊥ , then R = (R ∩ V ) ∪ (R ∩ V ⊥ ), contrary to
the hypothesis of irreducibility. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a root
α in W which is neither in V nor in V ⊥ . Thus α⊥ ∩ V is a proper subspace of
V , and there exists a root β ∈ V ∩ R which is neither in W nor in α⊥ . As α
and β are neither scalar multiples of one another nor mutually orthogonal, either
α + β or α − β belongs to R (depending on whether the inner product of α and
β is positive or negative.) Either way, α + β 6∈ V ∪ W , and the lemma follows by
induction.                                                                         ⊓
                                                                                   ⊔

Lemma 1.2: If p ≫ 0, then

                          dim Vλi ∈ pN ⇔ λi + ρi ∈ pN ρi .



Proof: One direction is trivial. By (1.0.1), it suffices to show dim Vλi ∈ pN implies
λi = 0 or λi + ρi ∈ pΛGi . If p does not divide λi + ρi , then

                        S = {α∨ ∈ Ri∨ | α∨ (λi + ρi ) ∈ pZ}

is a proper root subsystem of Ri∨ . For p ≫ 0, every root in α∨ ∈ R ∩ Span S
such that pα∨ ∈ S lies in S itself. (In fact, an examination of all equal-rank

                                         5
subsystems of all irreducible root systems show that it suffices to take p ≥ 5.)
Therefore, S is closed. By Lemma 1.1, the complement of S spans Ri∨ , so there
are finitely many elements µ ∈ ΛGi such that
                                                 Y
                             β ∨ (µ + ρi ) ≤            α∨ (ρi )
                                               α∨ ∈R∨
                                                    i



for all β ∨ ∈ Ri∨ \ S. If p ≫ 0, then p ∤ dim Vµ for all µ in this set. Thus
dim Vµ ∈ pN implies µ = 0.                                                            ⊓
                                                                                      ⊔

Corollary 1.3: The zeta-function of G determines, for each integer n, the
number of irreducible factors of the root system of G of cardinality n.

  This is not enough to determine the root system of G. For one thing, the root
systems Bi and Ci each have 2i2 roots. We also have coincidences with |Ri | = 12
(A3 and G2 ) |Ri | = 72 (B6 /C6 , and E6 ), |Ri | = 240 (A15 and E8 ), and a sparse
but infinite set of cases in which a root system of type A has the same number
of roots of one of type B, C, or D. So we need to refine the method. We note,
however, that fixing ζG (s) determines the rank of G. We may therefore define
NG to be the factorial of the number of roots in the root system of G. Thus NG
depends on the one hand only on the Lie algebra of G and on the other only on
the zeta-function of G. It also has the property that NG ΛG is contained in the
root lattice of G. We define
                                                     m
                                           Y         Y              +
                     ∗
                    ζG (s) = ζG (s)                       (1 − p−|Ri |s ).
                                      p≡1 (mod NG ) i=1


Note that for p ≡ 1    (mod NG ),

λ1 + · · · + λm ∈ ΛG ⇔ λ1 + · · · + λi−1 + (pλi + (p − 1)ρi ) + λi+1 + · · · + λm ∈ ΛG .


Definition 1.4: We say that a weight λi is allowable at a prime p if p ∤ λi +ρi .

Definition 1.5: We say that a weight λ1 + . . . + λm ∈ ΛG is allowable if for
every prime p ≡ 1 (mod NG ) and every positive integer i ≤ m, λi is allowable
at p. We write Λ∗G for the set of allowable dominant weights of G. Thus,
                                          X
                               ∗
                              ζG (s) =           dim(Vλ )−s .

                             ∗
  It is easier to work with ζG (s) than with ζG (s) because for λ ∈ Λ∗G , the con-
dition that dim Vλ is highly divisible by p ≡ 1 (mod NG ) gives substantial infor-
mation about the structure of the Lie algebra of G, whereas for non-allowable λ,
the same divisibility condition could hold for essentially trivial reasons.

2. Weyl polynomials

  In this section we consider a fixed simply connected almost simple group G, i.e.,
G is connected and simply connected, and G/Z(G) is simple. We are interested
in the dimensions of representations of G belonging to one-parameter families,
specifically the families p 7→ pµ + ν. We let R denote the root system of G; by
the weight lattice of R, we mean the weight lattice of G.

Definition 2.1: Given an irreducible root system R and elements µ and ν of
                                                R
the weight lattice of R, the Weyl polynomial Pµ,ν (x) ∈ Q[x] is given by the
formula

We will always assume that the following two conditions hold:

(2.1.2)                          α∨ (µ) ≥ 0 ∀α ∈ R+

and

(2.1.3)                 α∨ (µ) = 0 ⇒ α∨ (ν) ≥ 0 ∀α ∈ R+ .

This implies that (2.1.1) holds for all n ≫ 0. If p is a prime greater than the max-
imum of |α∨ (µ)|, |α∨ (ν + ρ)|, and |α∨ (ρ)| for any root α, then ordp (dim Vpµ+ν ) is
equal to |(ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R+ |, the multiplicity of 0 as a root of Pµ,ν

this multiplicity is |R+ | if and only if ν + ρ = 0, which corresponds to the case
that for all p, pµ + ν is not allowable at p.

Proposition 2.2: For every irreducible root system R, there exist weights µ and
ν satisfying (2.1.2) and (2.1.3) and such that (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R is a proper closed root
subsystem of R of maximal order. Moreover, we can choose µ and ν such that
µ + ν lies in the root lattice.

Proof: Let ̟i denote the ith fundamental weight in the Bourbaki ordering
[1] Planches. By definition, α∨
                              j (̟i ) = δij , so the Dynkin diagram of the root
system ̟i ⊥ ∩R is obtained from that of R by deleting the ith vertex.
  All claims made below about Weyl orbits of weights ̟i for exceptional groups
were checked with [4]. Note that [4] uses the Dynkin root ordering, which differs
from the Bourbaki ordering for En .
  For R = An , we may take

                         µ = −ν = ̟2 + ̟3 + · · · + ̟n .

As ν + ρ = ̟1 is the fundamental weight associated to vertex 1, (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R is
of type An−1 .
   For R = Bn , we may take

                         µ = −ν = ̟2 + ̟3 + · · · + ̟n .

As ν + ρ = ̟1 , (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R is of type Bn−1 .
  For R = Cn , we may take

                   µ = −ν = ̟1 + ̟2 + · · · + ̟n−2 + 2̟n−1 .

As ν + ρ = ̟n − ̟n−1 lies in the Weyl orbit of ̟1 , (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R is of type Cn−1 .
  For R = Dn , we may take

                   µ = −ν = ̟1 + ̟2 + · · · + ̟n−3 + 2̟n−2 .

As ν + ρ = ̟n + ̟n−1 − ̟n−2 lies in the Weyl orbit of ̟1 , (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R is of
type Dn−1 .
  For R = E6 , we may take

            µ = ̟2 + ̟3 + ̟5 + ̟6 , ν = −̟2 − 2̟3 − 2̟5 − ̟6 .

As ν + ρ = ̟1 − ̟3 + ̟4 − ̟5 lies in the Weyl orbit of ̟1 , (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R is of
type D5 .

                                        8
  For R = E7 , we may take
               µ = ̟1 + ̟3 + ̟4 + ̟6 , ν = −̟1 − ̟3 − 2̟4 − 2̟6 .
As ν + ρ = ̟2 − ̟4 + ̟5 − ̟6 + ̟7 lies in the Weyl orbit of ̟7 , (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R
is of type E6 .
  For R = E8 , we may take
       µ = ̟1 + ̟3 + ̟4 + ̟6 + ̟8 , ν = −̟1 − ̟3 − 2̟4 − 2̟6 − 2̟8 .
As ν +ρ = ̟2 −̟4 +̟5 −̟6 +̟7 −̟8 lies in the Weyl orbit of ̟8 , (ν +ρ)⊥ ∩R
is of type E7 .
  For R = F4 , we may take
                          µ = ̟1 + ̟2 , ν = −̟1 − 2̟2 .
As ν + ρ = −̟2 + ̟3 + ̟4 lies in the Weyl orbit of ̟4 , (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R is of type
B3 .
  For R = G2 , we may take
                                µ = ̟2 , ν = −2̟2 .
As ν + ρ = ̟1 − ̟2 lies in the Weyl orbit of ̟2 , (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R is of type A1 .
  Except in the exceptional cases, µ + ν = 0, so the root lattice condition is
trivial. It is likewise trivial for E8 , F4 , and G2 . This leaves E6 and E7 , where
the claim can be checked by [4].                                                  ⊓
                                                                                  ⊔
  We recall that the height of a rational number m/n is max(|m|, |n|), where
gcd(m, n) = 1.
Lemma 2.3: If R1 and R2 are irreducible root systems and µi , νi are roots of Ri
for i = 1, 2, either PµR11,ν1 (x) is a constant multiple of PµR22,ν2 (x) or the height

goes to ∞ as p increases without bound.
Proof: More generally, if f (x) is any non-constant rational function over Q, the
height of f (n) goes to ∞ as n → ∞. Indeed, writing f (x) as aQ(x) bR(x)
                                                                         , where a
and b are relatively prime integers and Q(x) and R(x) are monic polynomials
with integer coefficients, the greatest common divisor of Q(n) and R(n) divides
the (non-zero) resolvent of the two polynomials. Therefore, if either Q or R is
different from 1, the height of Q(n)/R(n) (and therefore the height of f (n)) goes
to infinity.                                                                        ⊓

3. Efficiency of root systems

  In this section we give a definition of efficiency purely in terms of root systems
and compute the efficiency of each simple root system. It is not obvious that this
coincides with the characterization (0.0.1) given in the introduction, though the
equivalence can be deduced easily from Proposition 4.3 below.

Definition 3.1: The efficiency eff(R) of an irreducible root system R is the
              |R′ |               ′      ′′
supremum of |R|−|R  ′′ | , where R and R    are closed root subsystems of R such that
                                                              +               |R′ |
R′ ∩ R′′ = ∅. The level lev(R) is the smallest value of |R′ | for which     |R|−|R′′ |
achieves eff(R).
  This definition is connected to the study of Weyl polynomials by the following
proposition:

Proposition 3.2: Let R be an irreducible root system with half-sum of roots ρ,
and consider all pairs of weights µ and ν of R satisfying (2.1.2), (2.1.3), and
ν + ρ 6= 0. The maximum of
                                            R
                                   ordx=0 Pµ,ν (x)
                                          R
                                    deg Pµ,ν (x)

is given by eff(R∨ ), and this maximum is achieved only when ordx=0 Pµ,ν
                                                                     R
                                                                         (x) ≥
      ∨
lev(R ).
   Note that R = R∨ except for the case Bn /Cn when n ≥ 3, and even here, as
we will see, eff(R) = eff(R∨ ) and lev(R) = lev(R∨ ), so in fact Proposition 3.2
remains true when all the occurrences of R∨ are replaced with R.

Proof: Let (R∨ )′ = (ν + ρ)⊥ ∩ R∨ , and (R∨ )′′ = µ⊥ ∩ R∨ . As ν + ρ 6= 0,
(R∨ )′′ is a proper subsystem of R∨ . If µ = 0, Pµ,ν
                                                 R
                                                     (x) is a non-zero constant,
so the maximum will not be achieved by such a choice. Therefore, (R∨ )′ and
(R∨ )′′ are proper closed root subsystems of R∨ , disjoint by (2.1.3). A factor
α∨ (µ)x + α∨ (ν + ρ) of Pµ,ν
                          R
                             (x) has degree 0 if α ∈ (R∨ )′′ and 1 otherwise. The
order of this polynomial at 0 is 1 if α ∈ (R∨ )′ and 0 otherwise. Taking the
product over R+ , we see that
                                     R
                             ordx=0 Pµ,ν (x)
                                    R (x)
                                             ≤ eff(R∨ )
                              deg Pµ,ν

for all µ and ν satisfying the hypotheses of the proposition. All the remains to
be shown is that a pair ((R∨ )′ , (R∨ )′′ ) achieving the bound eff(R) can always

                                         10
be found by taking a suitable choice of µ and ν. We claim that the choices
in Proposition 2.2 do the trick. This follows from the explicit computation of
efficiencies of all irreducible root systems given by the following proposition.
Proposition 3.3: The efficiencies of root systems of type An , Bn , Cn , Dn , E6 ,
                           n
E7 , E8 , F4 , and G2 are n+2 , n−1 , n−1 , n−1 , 10 , 3 , 63 , 3 , and 15 respectively. In
                                n+1 n+1 n+1 17 5 117 7
each case the efficiency is achieved only when R′ is a proper closed root subsystem
                                                                               2
of maximal order in R. Explicitly, the levels of these root systems are n 2−n ,
(n−1)2 , (n−1)2 , (n−1)(n−2), 20, 36, 63, 9, and 1 respectively. Two inequivalent
irreducible root systems with the same efficiency and the same level must be of
the form Bn and Cn for the same n ≥ 3.
Proof: We prove that in each case the efficiency is achieved when R′ is the largest
proper root subsystem and R′′ is as large as possible given R′ ∩R′′ = ∅. It suffices
to determine R0′ and R0′′ satisfying these conditions and show that if R′ is not
                           |R′ |          |R′0 |
of maximal order, then |R|−|R    ′′ | < |R|−|R′′ | . In particular, it suffices to prove
                                                    0
|R′ | + |R′′ | ≤ |R0′ | + |R0′′ |.
  For every closed root subsystem S ⊂ R, there exist choices of basis for R and
S such that every positive root of S is positive in R and every simple root of S is
simple in R ([1] VI, §1, Prop. 24). Thus we can regard root subsystems as arising
from subgraphs of the Dynkin diagram of R. This is convenient, among other
things, for computing the largest subsystems of the different root systems (which
are always obtained by removing a single vertex from the Dynkin diagram).
Explicitly, the proper closed root systems of maximal order for An , Bn , Cn , Dn ,
E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 , and G2 are An−1 , Bn−1 , Cn−1 , Dn−1 , D5 , E6 , E7 , B3 /C3 , and
A1 respectively. These give the values for lev(R) stated in the proposition.
  It is also worth noting that if rank R′ is n − 1, and f is a non-zero linear form
vanishing on the hyperplane Span R′ , then the Coxeter number h of every simple
factor of R′′ disjoint from R′ satisfies
                                                          f (s1 )

                                           s1 ,s2 ∈R\R′   f (s2 )
Indeed, a choice of half-plane with boundary Span R′ determines a basis on R′′ .
                                                P
If α1 , . . . , αt are the simple roots and α =   ni αi the highest root of a simple
factor of R′′ with Coxeter number h, then

The value on the right hand side of (3.3.1) can be computed easily by restricting
the adjoint representation of a group of type R to U (1) times a group of type R′
and looking at the U (1)-components of the resulting direct sum.
  With these general facts in hand, we now examine the cases.
                                                                                            √
  For An , we use ε-coordinates, in which the roots are the vectors of length                   2 in
ker Σ: Z n+1
            → Z, Σ denoting the sum of coordinates. Let      =          R0′
                                                                    ∩ An = An−1ε⊥
                                                                                1
and R0′′ = {±(ε1 − ε2 )}. We define an equivalence relation on {1, . . . , n + 1} by
setting i ∼ j if and only if εi −εj ∈ R′ ∪{0}. The equivalence classes I1 , . . . , Ic have
                                    ak = n + 1 and R′ = ak >1 Aak −1 . Given k 6= l,
                                  P                     Q
cardinality a1 , . . . , ac where
the set {εi − εj ∈ R′′ | i ∈ Ik , j ∈ Il } has at most min(ai , aj ) ≤ (ai − 1)(aj − 1) + 1
elements since R′ and R′′ are disjoint. Thus
                              X                X
           |R′ | + |R′′ | ≤       a2k − ak +          (ak al − ak − al + 2)
                              k                k6=l

                         = (n + 1)2 − (n + 1) − 2(c − 1)(n + 1) + 2c(c − 1)
                         = (n + 2 − c)2 + c2 − (n + 2).

Thus |R′ | + |R′′ | < n2 − n + 2 unless c ≤ 2 or c ≥ n. For c ≤ 2, |R′′ | ≤ 2, and for
c ≥ n, |R′ | ≤ 2, so either way |R′ | + |R′′ | is bounded above by |R0′ | + |R0′′ |.
  For Bn (resp. Cn ) we use the ε-coordinate system, in which the short (resp.
long) vectors are εi (resp. 2εi ). Let R0′ = ε⊥                    ⊥
                                              1 ∩Bn = Bn−1 (resp. ε1 ∩Cn = Cn−1 )
and R0′′ = {±ε1 } (resp. {±2ε1 }). Let I ′ be the set of i ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that
εi (resp. 2εi ) lies in R′ and I ′′ the corresponding set for R′′ . As R′ and R′′
are disjoint, I ′ ∩ I ′′ = ∅, and we let I denote the complement of I ′ ∪ I ′′ . By
disjointness, ±εi ± εj 6∈ R′′ for i, j ∈ I ′ and ±εi ± εj 6∈ R′ for i, j ∈ I ′′ ; the
set {±εi ± εj | i ∈ I, j ∈ I ′ }, which is disjoint from R′ , meets R′′ in at most
2 min(|I|, |I ′ |) elements, and likewise {±εi ± εj | i ∈ I, j ∈ I ′′ }, which is disjoint
from R′′ , meets R′ in at most 2 min(|I|, |I ′′|) elements. Finally, for each i, j ∈ I,
i 6= j, the set {±εi ± εj } meets R′ in at most 2 vectors and R′′ in at most 2
vectors. Combining these facts, we get
(3.3.2)
  |R′ | + |R′′ | ≤ (2|I ′ |2 + |I|2 − |I| + 2 min(|I|, |I ′′|))

As |I| + |I ′ | + |I ′′ | = n, for n ≥ 4, this quantity is ≤ |R0′ | + |R0′′ | = 2n2 − 4n + 4
unless one of |I|, |I ′ |, and |I ′′ | is at least n − 1. If |I| = n − 1, then the first
inequality of (3.3.2) reads

               |R′ | + |R′′ | ≤ 2n2 − 6n + 8 ≤ 2n2 − 4n + 4 = |R0′ | + |R0′′ |.

If |I| = n, then |R′ | ≤ n2 − n and |R′′ | ≤ n2 − n, with equality only if the systems
are of type An−1 . If R′ is of type An−1 , the right hand side of (3.3.1) is 3 (resp.
2), so assuming n ≥ 4, R′′ cannot also be of type An−1 . Thus,

                     |R′ |          n(n − 1)      n−1      |R0′ |
                               <                =     =               .
                  |R| − |R′′ |   2n2 − n(n − 1)   n+1   |R| − |R0′′ |

Thus |R′ | + |R′′ | is indeed maximized when R′ is Bn−1 (resp. Cn−1 ). The same
is true for n = 2 and n = 3 by a simple case analysis.
    For Dn , we again use the ε-coordinate system, in which the roots are the length
√
  2 vectors in Zn . Let R0′ = ε⊥                   ′′
                               1 ∩ Dn = Dn−1 and R0 = {±ε1 ± ε2 } = D2 . The
subsystem R′ defines an equivalence relation ∼ on {1, 2, . . . , n}, where i ∼ j if
i = j or {±εi ± εj } ⊂ R′ . As R′ is a closed root subsystem, there can be at most
one ∼ equivalence class with 2 or more elements; indeed,

                         {±εi ± εk } ⊂ Span {±εi ± εj , ±εk ± εl }.

Let I ′ denote this class (or the empty set) and I ′′ the corresponding set for R′′ .
As R′ ∩ R′′ = ∅, |I ′ ∩ I ′′ | ≤ 1. Let I denote the complement of I ′ ∪ I ′′ . Reasoning
as in the case Bn /Cn , ±εi ± εj 6∈ R′′ for i, j ∈ I ′ and ±εi ± εj 6∈ R′ for i, j ∈ I ′′ ;
the set {±εi ± εj | i ∈ I, j ∈ I ′ }, which is disjoint from R′ , meets R′′ in at most
2 min(|I|, |I ′ |) elements, and likewise {±εi ± εj | i ∈ I, j ∈ I ′′ }, which is disjoint
from R′′ , meets R′ in at most 2 min(|I|, |I ′′|) elements. Again for each i, j ∈ I,
i 6= j, the set {±εi ± εj } meets R′ in at most 2 vectors and R′′ in at most 2
vectors, so

    |R′ | + |R′′ | ≤ (2|I ′ |2 − 2|I ′ | + |I|2 − |I| + 2 min(|I|, |I ′′|))
                                         + (2|I ′′ |2 − 2|I ′′ | + |I|2 − |I| + 2 min(|I|, |I ′|))
                  ≤ 2|I|2 + 2|I ′ |2 − |I ′ | + 2|I ′′ |2 − |I ′′ |
                                       1                     1      1

                                                 13
Moreover, |I ′ |, |I ′′ | ≤ n−1, |I|+|I ′ | ≤ n, |I|+|I ′′ | ≤ n, and |I|+|I ′ |+|I ′′ | ≤ n+1.
If
                       |R′ | + |R′′ | > |R0′ | + |R0′′ | = 2n2 − 6n + 8,

either |I|, |I ′ |, or |I ′′ | is at least n − 1. Now |I| ≥ n − 1 implies I ′ = I ′′ = ∅,
so either R′ = An−1 or |R′ | ≤ (n − 1)(n − 2), and likewise for R′′ . If |R′ | ≤
                                                    |R |       ′

(n − 1)(n − 2) and |R′′ | ≤ (n − 1)(n − 2), then |R|−|R  ′′ | ≤ n+1 < |R|−|R′′ | . If
                                                                          0
                                                                            0
R′ = An−1 , the upper bound (3.3.1) is 2, so R′′ is of the form Ar1 (and vice
versa). If R′ or R′′ has r mutually orthogonal roots, since they are closed root
subsystems, the Dynkin diagram of Dn must have r vertices, no two of which
share an edge, so r ≤ n/2 + 1, and

           |R′ | + |R′′ | ≤ n(n − 1) + n + 2 ≤ 2n2 − 6n + 8 = |R0′ | + |R0′′ |,

as long as n ≥ 5. For n = 4, we check by hand that there do not exist 3 mutually
orthogonal roots in D4 \ A3 , so (D3 , D2 ) is still optimal.
  For E8 , |R| = 240. The largest closed subsystem, E7 , has 126 roots, and it
can be realized as the set of roots orthogonal to a given root α; D7 is next with
        126       84
84. As 240−6  > 240−84 , it suffices to prove that the largest closed root subsystem
of E8 disjoint from E7 = α⊥ ∩ E8 has order 6. The orthogonal projection of
any root onto Rα is in {−α, − 12 α, 0, 12 α, α}, so the right hand side of (3.3.1) is 3.
Thus all factors of R′′ are of type A1 or A2 . Moreover, a factor of type A2 must
contain α itself (which is the only root whose projection onto Rα equals α), so if
R′′ contains any factor of the form A2 , then R′′ = A2 . Otherwise, R′′ = An1 . We
look for the largest value such that An1 can be embedded as a closed subsystem
in E8 with no root orthogonal to α. Equivalently, we fix an embedding of An1 in
E8 and ask whether any root of E8 fails to be orthogonal to every root of An1 .
Equivalently, we ask whether the restriction of the adjoint representation of E8
to An1 has an irreducible summand which is non-trivial on each factor A1 .
  To construct mutually orthogonal roots in E8 , we start with a root β1 , choose
β2 ∈ β1⊥ ∩ E8 = E7 , choose β3 ∈ β2⊥ ∩ E7 = D6 , choose β4 ∈ β3⊥ ∩ D6 = A1 × D4 ,
and so on. All choices are equivalent until β4 , which can be chosen in A1 or in
D4 . In the first case, A41 ⊂ D4⊥ ∩ E8 = D4 , so the system is not closed. We use
branching rules [4], starting with the adjoint representation of E8 , restricting to
A1 × E7 , taking only representations of E7 which appear opposite a non-trivial
factor in A1 , and so on. We get the (56-dimensional) representation V̟7 of E7 ,

                                              14
and then the (12-dimensional) representation V̟1 of D6 , then a representation
of A1 × D4 which is 2-dimensional and therefore trivial on the D4 factor. We
conclude that A31 can be realized (and it is indeed a closed subsystem of E8
since no simply laced rank 3 system contains A31 as a proper subsystem), but A41
cannot.
  For E7 , |R| = 126. The largest subsystem, E6 , has 72 roots; D6 comes next,
                                     72       42
with 60, and then A6 , with 42. As 126−6  > 126−42 , we need only consider the
cases R′ = E6 and R′ = D6 . Writing E6 as the orthogonal complement of
the fundamental weight ̟7 the right hand side of (3.3.1) is 2, so we need only
consider R′′ = Ar1 . We proceed as before, with β1 ∈ E7 , β2 ∈ β1⊥ ∩ E7 = D6 ,
and β3 ∈ β2⊥ ∩ D6 = A1 × D4 . Applying the branching rules for V̟7 , which we
have already described, we see that if we choose β3 to be in the factor A1 , the
restriction of V̟7 to A31 has a summand non-trivial on every factor, so we can
take R′′ = A31 . Any fourth root β4 mutually orthogonal to the first three must
lie in the D4 factor, and we know from the E8 analysis that ̟7 cannot be non-
orthogonal to β1 , β2 , and such a β4 . When R′ = D6 = α⊥ ∩ E7 , the argument for
E8 shows that either R′′ = A2 or R′′ = An1 where n ≤ 7 for dimension reasons.
     72      60
As 126−6 > 126−14 , we see that (E6 , A31 ) is optimal.
  For E6 , |R| = 72. The largest subsystem, D5 , has 40 roots, the next largest,
                                                     40      24
A5 , has 30, and the third largest, D4 , has 24. As 72−4 > 72−24 , we need only
consider D5 = ̟1⊥ ∩ E6 and A5 = α⊥ ∩ E6 , where α is a root. For R′ = D5 , the
right hand side of (3.3.1) is 2, so R′′ = An1 . Choose β1 ∈ E6 , β2 ∈ β1⊥ ∩ E6 = A5 ,
and β3 ∈ β2⊥ ∩ A5 = A3 . In the restriction of V̟1 to A1 × A5 , the only summand
non-trivial on A1 is 6-dimensional on A5 ; its restriction to A1 × A3 is the a direct
sum of a representation trivial on A1 and a representation trivial on A3 . It follows
that the restriction of V̟1 to A21 has a summand non-trivial on both factors but
the restriction to A31 has no such summand. For R′ = A5 , the right hand side of
(3.3.1) is 3, so as in the E8 case, R′′ = A2 or R′′ = An1 , and of course n ≤ 5. As
 40        30
72−4
      > 72−10  , (R′ , R′′ ) = (D5 , A21 ) is optimal.
  For F4 , |R| = 48, and the largest proper closed root subsystems are obtained
by deleting an endpoint vertex from the Dynkin diagram. They are of type B3
and C3 , and are both of order 9; in each case, Span R′ = α⊥ ∩ R for a root
α, short or long respectively. Either way, the bound on the Coxeter number of
components of R′′ is 3, so we need only consider A1 , A2 , A1 × A1 , and A2 × A1
as possibilities for R′′ . In each case, A2 can be realized; for example, if α = ̟4

                                         15
 with respect to the standard coordinates on F4 , R′′ can be taken to have basis
 {2̟4 − ̟3 , ̟3 − ̟4 }. In each case, α or −α is the highest vector of the A2 , so
 A2 × A1 cannot be disjoint from Span R′ (since ±α belong to both). Finally, if
 R′ is not of type B3 or C3 , it has at most 8 roots, and 8 + 8 < 18 + 6.
   The case G2 is trivial since any proper root subsystem has rank 1 and therefore
 order 2.
                                                                                 ⊓
                                                                                 ⊔

 Definition 3.4: We say an irreducible root system S is greater than or equal
 to an irreducible root system T (and write S ≥ T ) if and only if eff(S) > eff(T )
 or eff(S) = eff(T ) and lev(S) ≤ lev(T ). If S ≥ T but T  S, we say S is
 strictly greater than T .
   An immediate consequence of Proposition 3.3 is that S ≥ T and T ≥ S implies
 S = T or S = T ∨ .

 4. The main theorem

 Lemma 4.1: Let R be an irreducible root system spanning a Euclidean space E
 and Q a quadratic form on E such that Q(α) = 0 for all α ∈ R. Then Q = 0.

 Proof: Let B(x, y) = Q(x + y) − Q(x) − Q(y) denote the associated bilinear form.
 If α and β are roots of R making an obtuse angle, then α + β is again a root, so
 B(α, β) = 0. Likewise, if α and β make an acute angle, α − β is a root, so again
 B(α, β) = 0. The roots in R \ α⊥ span E by Lemma 1.1. Therefore, B(α, E) = 0.
 As every α ∈ R lies in the null space of B, is follows that B and therefore Q
 must be 0.                                                                  ⊓
                                                                             ⊔

 Proposition 4.2: If R1 and R2 are irreducible root systems with R1 ≥ R2 , then
 there exist weights µ1 and ν1 and an integer N such that:

1) µ1 and ν1 satisfy (2.1.2) and (2.1.3);
2) ν1 + ρ1 6= 0;
3) µ1 + ν1 lies in the root lattice of R1 ;
               R
     ordx=0 Pµ11,ν1 (x)
4)           R            = eff(R1 );
      deg   Pµ11,ν1 (x)
5) If µ2 and ν2 are weights of R2 and c is a positive constant such that

     (4.2.1)                            PµR22,ν2 (x) = cPµR11,ν1 (x),

                                                   16
  then
 a) eff(R1 ) = eff(R2 ) and lev(R1 ) = lev(R2 ).
 b) c ≥ 1, with equality only if R1 = R2 ;
 c) If p > N and ordp c > 0, then p divides ν2 + ρ2 , i.e., ν2 is not alowable at p.

Proof:
  First we observe that condition (4) implies that PµR11,ν1 (x) is not a monomial in
x, so that (4.2.1) implies the same for PµR22,ν2 (x). This implies that ν2 + ρ2 6= 0,
so
                              ordx=0 PµR22,ν2 (x)
                                                    ≤ eff(R2 ).
                                deg PµR22,ν2 (x)
The hypothesis eff(R1 ) ≥ eff(R2 ) then implies eff(R1 ) = eff(R2 ). Proposition
3.2 and equation (4.2.1) then imply

             lev(R2 ) ≤ ordx=0 PµR22,ν2 (x) = ordx=0 PµR11,ν1 (x) = lev(R1 ),

so lev(R2 ) = lev(R1 ).
   For (b), we choose µ1 and ν1 as in Proposition 2.2. We note that for any
integer n, whether or not λ2 = nµ2 + ν is dominant, PµR22,ν2 (n) is either zero or
±1 times the dimension of an irreducible representation of a Lie group of type
R2 . Indeed, suppose α∨ (λ2 + ρ2 ) 6= 0 for all α. Then defining w in the Weyl
group of R2 as the unique element such that w(λ2 + ρ2 ) is dominant, and setting
λ′2 = w(λ2 + ρ2 ) − ρ2 , the weight λ′2 is dominant. Thus,
                                            α∨ (λ′2 + ρ2 )
                                    Q
                                 +
              dim Vλ2′ = (−1)|R2 | α∈R
                                              α∨ (ρ2 )
                                       Q
                     2
                                    Q α∈R∨
                                 +          α (λ2 + ρ2 )
                        = (−1)|R2 | α∈RQ        ∨
                                                           = PµR22,ν2 (n)2 .
                                          α∈R α (ρ2 )

For R1 of type An , Bn , Cn , or Dn , we have PµR11,ν1 (1) = 1, so PµR22,ν2 (1) = c implies
c ∈ Z and therefore c ≥ 1. The same is true for G2 , since PµR11,ν1 (2) = 1. For F4 ,

                  gcd(PµR11,ν1 (2), PµR11,ν1 (3)) = gcd(52, 340119) = 1,

so again c must be an integer. For E6 , we have

gcd(PµR11,ν1 (2),PµR11,ν1 (3),PµR11,ν1 (4)) = gcd(1728, 3171108447, 71292900343808) = 1,

so again c ∈ Z. For E7 , we have

         gcd(PµR11,ν1 (2), PµR11,ν1 (3)) = gcd(573440, 33940969546604175) = 5,

                                             17
so 5c ∈ Z. Thus, |PµR22,ν2 (2)| is a positive integer multiple of 573440
                                                                    5    = 114688.
However, the lowest degree of any irreducible representation of a Lie group of
type E7 which is divisible by 114688 is 573440 itself. For E8 ,

   gcd(PµR11,ν1 (2), PµR11,ν1 (3)) = gcd(4096000, 2665014302693985712862760000)
                                      = 8000,

and the smallest dimension of any irreducible representation of a Lie group of
type E8 which is divisible by 512 = 4096000
                                      8000
                                            is 4096000.
  To finish proving (b), it suffices to show that if R1 is Bn or Cn , n ≥ 3, R2 = R1∨ ,
µ1 and ν1 are defined as in Proposition 2.2, and µ2 and ν2 are any weights of R2 ,
then PµR11,ν1 6= ±PµR22,ν2 . If µ and ν are weights of Bn such that ordx=0 Pµ,ν
                                                                            Bn
                                                                                (x)
achieves the maximum (n − 1)2 , then ν + ρ must be a scalar multiple dεi of an ε-
basis vector, and writing µ = (a1 , . . . , an ), either ai = ±aj for some j 6= i or some
aj = 0. We can always replace ν by any linked weight w(ν + ρ) − ρ with the effect
               Bn
of changing Pµ,ν  by a factor of ±1, so without loss of generality we may assume µ
is dominant, which means we may assume either a1 > a2 > · · · > an−1 > an = 0
(and i = n) or, renumbering, a1 > · · · > ai = ai > · · · > an−1 > 0. In the first
case,
                                                                       Qn−1

  Given two pairs (µ1 , ν1 ) and (µ2 , ν2 ) of weights of an irreducible root system
R, i = 1, 2, we have maps fi : R+ → Q2 defined by

                                 fi (α) = (α∨ (µi ), α∨ (νi )).

Suppose that PµR2 ,ν2 (x) = cPµR1 ,ν1 (x) 6= 0. Then (0, 0) 6∈ fi (R+ ) and for some
permutation σ: R+ → R+ , f2 (α) is a scalar multiple of f1 (α) for all α. As there
are only finitely many possibilities for σ, by making N large enough we may
assume without loss of generality that σ is the identity. Thus,

                    α∨ (µ1 )α∨ (ν2 + ρ2 ) − α∨ (µ2 )α∨ (ν1 + ρ1 ) = 0

for all α∨ ∈ R∨ . Regarding the above expression as a quadratic form on R∨ ,
by Lemma 4.1, it is trivial, so (µ2 , ν2 + ρ2 ) = C(µ1 , ν1 + ρ1 ) for some non-zero
                                              +
rational number C. Therefore c = C |R | , and claim (c) follows.                         ⊓
                                                                                         ⊔

Proposition 4.3: Let l ∈ N, e ∈ Q, and G a simply connected almost simple
Lie group such that for every almost simple factor Gi of G with root system Ri ,
either eff(Ri ) < e or eff(Ri ) = e and lev(Ri ) ≥ l. Let A(G) denote the set of
pairs (p, λ), where p is a prime and λ is a dominant weight of G allowable at p.
Then

(4.3.1)              inf      e log dim Vλ − (log p)ordp dim Vλ > −∞.
                 (p,λ)∈A(G)


Moreover, for every C ∈ R, there exists a finite set

                              LG,e,l,C = {(µ, ν) | µ, ν ∈ ΛG }

such that for all (p, λ) ∈ A(G) such that ordp dim Vλ ≤ l and

(4.3.2)                    e log dim Vλ − (log p)ordp dim Vλ ≤ C,

there exists (µ, ν) ∈ LG,e,l,C such that λ = pµ+ν and either µ = 0, or µ is a non-
zero weight of an almost simple factor Gi of G with eff(Ri ) = e and lev(Ri ) = l.

                                              19
Proof: Suppose first that G is almost simple with root system R and Coxeter
number h. We take advantage of the equalities |R| = |R∨ |, eff(R) = eff(R∨ ),
and lev(R) = lev(R∨ ) to avoid burdening our notation unnecessarily with                                          ∨

superscripts. Define

(4.3.3)        Si = {α∨ ∈ R∨ : pi |α∨ (λ + ρ)}, Ri′ = R∨ ∩ Span Si

Thus,
                       R∨ ⊃ R1′ ⊃ R2′ ⊃ · · · ⊃ Rk′ % Rk+1
                                                       ′
                                                           = ∅.

An examination of the list of all equal-rank root subsystems of all irreducible
root systems shows that α ∈ Ri′ implies either 2α or 3α lies in the abelian group
generated by Si . As λ is allowable at p, Ri′ is a proper subsystem of R∨ except
possibly when i = 1 and p ≤ 3. Let Ri′′ denote the closed root subsystem of R∨
generated by the simple roots α∨ such that
                                                                pi
(4.3.4)                               0 < α∨ (λ + ρ) <             .
                                                                3h
                                                       i
For any root in Ri′′ , 0 < α∨ (λ + ρ) < p3 , so neither 2α∨ nor 3α∨ lies in the
abelian group generated by Si , which means Ri′ ∩ Ri′′ = ∅. We have
                                                        k

                                                        i=1

with equality if p ≥ 5, and

(4.3.6)      log dim Vλ ≥ −|R | log 3h + log p                       (|R+ | − |(Ri′′ )+ |).
                                                               i=1

Except possibly when i = 1 and p ≤ 3,

(4.3.7)                      eff(R)(|R+| − |(Ri′′ )+ |) ≥ |(Ri′ )+ |,

so

By (4.3.6), (4.3.8), and (4.3.5),

     e log dim Vλ − log p ordp dim Vλ ≥ eff(R) log dim Vλ − log p ordp dim Vλ
                                               ≥ −eff(R)|R+| log 9h.

                                                  20
This gives (4.3.1).
  If e > eff(R), then

  e log dim Vλ − log p ordp dim Vλ ≥ (e − eff(R)) log dim Vλ − eff(R)|R+ | log 9h

implies that the left hand side is ≥ C for all but finitely many weights λ, inde-
pendent of p. We can therefore define LG,e,l,C to be the set of pairs (0, ν), as ν
ranges over all such λ. If l < lev(R), then for p ≥ 5, (4.3.5) is an equality, and
so |(Ri′ )+ | < lev(R) for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. It follows that (4.3.7) is strict and that

  eff(R) log dim Vλ − log p ordp dim Vλ
           ≥ eff(R)(|R+| − |(Ri′′ )+ |) − |(Ri′ )+ | log p − eff(R)|R+| log 9h > C
                                                   	


for p ≫ 0. We therefore obtain an upper bound on p, which then gives an upper
bound on dim Vλ and consequently a finite set of possible λ, and we can set
LG,e,l,C to be a set of pairs (0, λ) as before. The only way in which dim Vλ could
fail to be bounded by the condition (4.3.2) is if eff(R) = e and lev(R) = l and
moreover |(Ri′ )+ | = lev(R) for all i ≤ k. For p ≥ 5, equality holds in (4.3.5), and
this last condition implies k = 1.
  To prove that λ can be written pµ + ν, where µ and ν are drawn from finite
sets independent of p, we may assume that we have fixed S = R1′ and T = R1′′ .

                                                                   X

                                                                 α∈R+


so there are only finitely many possible values for the integers p−1 α∨ (λ + ρ) for
α ∈ S + and α∨ (λ + ρ) for α ∈ T + which will bound

                                            eff(R) log dim Vλ − log p ordp dim Vλ
    log dim Vλ − (|R+ | − |T + |) log p =

                                            21
above. For every β ∨ ∈ ZR∨ ∩ Span S ∩ Span T , β ∨ (λ + ρ) is both divisible by p
and bounded absolutely. Fixing a basis of Span S ∩ Span T in the root lattice of
R∨ , we conclude that for p ≫ 0, β ∨ (λ + ρ) = 0 for all β ∨ ∈ Span S ∩ Span T .
As S ∨ and T ∨ generate the root lattice, there exists a unique weight ν such that
α∨ (ν + ρ) = 0 for all α∨ ∈ S and α∨ (ν + ρ) = α∨ (λ + ρ) for all α∨ ∈ T . Letting
µ = (λ − ν)/p, we see that α∨ (µ) is an integer for all α∨ ∈ S ∪ T and therefore for
all roots in R∨ ; it follows that µ is also a weight, and as µ and ν are determined
independently of p by the values p−1 α∨ (λ + ρ) for α∨ ∈ S + and α∨ (λ + ρ) for
α∨ ∈ T , there are only finitely many possibilities for (µ, ν). Thus the proposition
is true when G is almost simple. Note that in every case where µ 6= 0 arises,
ordp dim Vλ = l, the maximum allowable value.
   Now consider a general G = G1 × · · · × Gn . Let

                   Bi =       inf        e log dim Vλ − (log p)ordp dim Vλ
                          (p,λ)∈A(Gi )

Then letting λi denote the ith component of λ,
                                       X
   e log dim Vλ − (log p)ordp dim Vλ =   e log dim Vλi − (log p)ordp dim Vλi
                                                   i
                                                  X

          P
so B =     i   Bi is a lower bound for (4.3.1). On the other hand,

                          e log dim Vλ − (log p)ordp dim Vλ ≤ C

implies
                                                              X
          e log dim Vλi − (log p)ordp dim Vλi ≤ C −                  Bj , = C − B + Bi
                                                              j6=i

so there exist sets LGi ,e,l,C−B+Bi such that each λi = pµi + νi for some (µi , νi ) ∈
LGi ,e,l,C−B+Bi . Letting

we obtain a finite set of pairs (µ, ν) of the desired kind. In particular, for each λ
satisfying the condition ordp Vλ ≤ l, there can be at most one coordinate i with
µi 6= 0 because
                                    ordp dim Vpµi +νi = l
for each non-zero µi and each p ≫ 0.

Theorem 4.4: The zeta-function of a compact semisimple Lie group G deter-
mines the Lie algebra of the group up to isomorphism.

Proof: Let G1 and G2 be compact semisimple Lie groups with ζG1 (s) = ζG2 (s)
but with non-isomorphic Lie algebras. By Corollary 1.3, the number of factors of
type A1 in G1 and G2 are the same. Let R1i , R2i , . . . be the irreducible factors of
the root system Ri of Gi . If G1 and G2 have different Lie algebras, by a suitable
renumbering, we may assume that for some k ≥ 0

                 R11 ≥ R21 ≥ · · · , R12 ≥ R22 ≥ · · · , Ri1 = Ri2 ∀i ≤ k,

and there is no factor in Rk+1 , Rk+2 , . . . which equals Rk+1 or is strictly greater
than it. In particular, R1 has at least k + 1 irreducible factors (though R2 might
                             1
have only k.) Moreover, Rk+1      is not of type A1 . Under these conditions, we
                                                          ∗
will find an integer n such that the nth coefficient of ζG  1 (s) is positive and the

                    ∗
nth coefficient of ζG2 (s) is zero, which by Corollary 1.3 implies ζG1 (s) 6= ζG2 (s).
Without loss of generality we may assume that G1 is adjoint and G2 is simply
connected, so both are products of almost simple factors: Gi = j Gij .
                                                                 Q

  In fact, we will prove the following stronger statement: under these conditions,
if r is a fixed positive integer, then there exist primes p1 ≫ · · · ≫ pk , all congruent
to 1 (mod NG1 = NG2 ) and an allowable weight λ1 of G1 such that

(4.4.1)                ordpi dim Vλ1 = lev(Ri1 ), 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1

and there is no allowable weight λ2 of G2 such that the following conditions hold:

(4.4.2)               ordpi dim Vλ2 = lev(Ri1 ), 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1;


(4.4.3)                           dim Vλ2 | r dim Vλ1 ;


(4.4.4)                           dim Vλ2 ≤ dim Vλ1 .

Explicitly, we may take λ1 = λ11 + · · · + λ1k+1 , where λ1i = pi µ1i + νi1 , and µ1i and
νi1 are defined by Proposition 2.2 as weights of the factor G̃1i of G̃1 . Note that the
congruence condition on pi guarantees that each λ1i lies in the root lattice of G̃1i
and therefore defines a representation of G1i . Note also that we take all primes
pi in the construction to be larger than the bound N in Proposition 4.2 (which

                                            23
depends only on the root systems of G1 and G2 .) We also choose each pi large
                                                    R1
enough that for each j ≤ k +1, pi > Pµ1j,ν 1 (2); again, this condition depends only
                                                     j   j

on G1 . By choosing each pj to be congruent to 2 modulo a sufficiently high power
of pj+1 · · · pk pk+1 , we can guarantee that pi ∤ dim Vλ1j for i > j, and therefore, we
can guarantee (4.4.1).
  Suppose the claim does not hold for k = 0. If R11 = A1 , we are done. Otherwise,
 R1
Pµ11,ν 1 (x) is not constant. As

                                                                R1
                                                   ordx=0 Pµ11,ν 1 (x)
                                     eff(R11 ) =         R1
                                                                1    1
                                                                         ,
                                                    deg Pµ11,ν 1 (x)
                                                          1 1

we have

(4.4.5)                   eff(R11 ) log dim Vλ11 ≤ lev(R11 ) log p1 + C,

for some constant C depending only on R1 . By (4.4.3),

                  eff(R11 ) log dim Vλ2 ≤ lev(R11 ) log p1 + eff(R11 ) log r + C.

Applying Proposition 4.3 with e = eff(R11 ), l = lev(R11 ), G = G2 , p = p1 , and
λ2 an allowable weight of G2 satisfying (4.4.2)–(4.4.4), we deduce that λ2 must
be of the form p1 µ + ν, where µ and ν belong to finite sets independent of p1 .
     R1
As Pµ11,ν 1 (x) is not constant, dim Vλ11 → ∞ as p1 → ∞, so for p1 ≫ 0, µ 6= 0.
          1   1
Again by Proposition 4.3, µ must be a weight of an almost simple factor G21
of G2 , and R12 must have the same efficiency and level as R11 . (By hypothesis,
R12 and R11 cannot be equal, so at this point we must be in the Bn /Cn case,
though we do not use this fact explicitly.) Writing G2 = G21 × H 2 , we can
decompose λ2 = λ21 + (λ2 − λ21 ), where the second summand is a weight of H 2 ,
and λ21 = p1 µ21 + ν12 , where µ21 and ν12 belong to finite sets independent of p1 .
                                               dim Vλ1
By (4.3.1) and (4.4.5), the fraction           dim Vλ2
                                                          1
                                                              is bounded above, and by (4.4.3), its
                                                          1
denominator is bounded above by r, so the height of the fraction is bounded. By
Lemma 2.3, therefore, dim Vλ2 is the value at p1 of a Weyl polynomial which is
                      R1
a scalar multiple of Pµ11,ν 1 (x). By Proposition 4.2, dim Vλ21 > dim Vλ11 , contrary
                             1   1
to (4.4.4).
  The induction step is similar, but we must exercise some additional care. We
write G1 = G11 × H 1 . We assume p1 is large compared to the degree of the
representation of dim Vλ1 −λ11 . In other words, the upper bound on

                             eff(R11 ) log dim Vλ1 − lev(R11 ) log p1

                                                     24
depends on p2 , p3 , . . . , pk+1 , which we regard as constant, but not on p1 , which
we take as large as we need. Applying Proposition 4.3 and Lemma 2.3 as before,
there exists a simple factor G21 of G2 , weights µ21 and ν12 of G21 , and a rational
number c ≥ 1, such that the root system R12 has the same efficiency and level as
R11 , λ21 = pµ21 + ν12 , and
                                        R1             R2
                                     cPµ11,ν 1 (x) = Pµ21,ν 2 (x).
                                         1   1          1   1


Moreover c = 1 implies R11 = R12 . As λ11 and λ21 are allowable, Proposition 4.2
guarantees that ordpi c = 0 for all i. Writing G2 = G21 × H 2 , λ2 − λ21 is an
allowable dominant weight of H 2 , and for i ≥ 2,

               ordpi dim Vλ2 −λ21 = ordpi dim Vλ2 − ordpi dim Vλ21
                                                                         R2
                                         = ordpi dim Vλ1 − ordpi Pµ21,ν 2 (p1 )
                                                                         1    1

                                                                     R1
                                         =   ordpi dim Vλ1 − ordpi Pµ11,ν 1 (p1 )
                                                                      1 1

                                         =   ordpi dim Vλ2 −λ21 = lev(Ri1 ).

As dim Vλ2 −λ21 divides ht(c)r dim Vλ1 −λ11 , and ht(c)r can be bounded independent
of the choice of primes pi , we can apply the induction hypothesis to conclude that

                                 dim Vλ2 −λ21 > dim Vλ1 −λ11 .

Therefore

            dim Vλ2 = dim Vλ21 dim Vλ2 −λ21 > dim Vλ21 dim Vλ1 −λ11
                            R2                                  R1
                       = Pµ21,ν 2 (p1 ) dim Vλ1 −λ11 ≥ Pµ11,ν 1 (p1 ) dim Vλ1 −λ11

                       = dim Vλ11 dim Vλ1 −λ11 = dim Vλ1 ,

contrary to (4.4.4).                                                                 ⊓
                                                                                     ⊔


5. The Gassmann Phenomenon

  Let G = SU(2)n and Z = Z(G). Irreducible representations of G are indexed
by ordered n-tuples of non-negative integers: λ = (a1 , . . . , an ). The representa-
tion associated to λ is

               Vλ = V(a1 ,...,0) ⊗ · · · ⊗ V(0,...,an ) = Wa1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ Wan ,

                                                  25
where Wi denotes the ith symmetric power of the natural representation of SU(2).
The restriction of Vλ to Z ∼
                           = Fn2 is isotypic with character χλ . In coordinates,


                          χλ (a1 , . . . , an ) = (−1)a1 z1 +···+an zn .


For any character χ ∈ Z ∗ , we write


                                Xχ = {λ ∈ Nn | χλ = χ}.


Thus, Xχ consists of n-tuples of non-negative integers such that each coordinate
has prescribed parity.
     Let Zi (i = 1, 2) denote any subgroup of Z, and let Gi = G/Zi . Then,

                                         X X
                            ζGi (s) =                    (dim Vλ )−s .
                                        χ∈Zi⊥ λ∈Xχ


Now,
                                                n
                                                Y
                                   dim Vλ =          (ai + 1),
                                               i=1

so
                   X
                         (dim Vλ )−s = (2−s ζ(s))O (ζ(s) − 2−s ζ(s))E ,
                  λ∈Xχ


where O (resp. E) is the number of coordinates which are constrained to be odd
(resp. even) in Xχ . Thus O + E = n and E − O is the trace of σ(χ), where
σ: Z ∗ = Fn2 → GLn (C) is defined by

                                                     ∗
                                               (−1)z1
                                                                        
                                                           ···     0
                     σ(z1∗ , . . . , zn∗ ) =  ...         ..      ..
                                                                         .
                                                                        
                                                               .    .
                                                                       ∗
                                                                      zn
                                                0          · · · (−1)

As long as
                 |{z ∗ ∈ Z1⊥ | σ(z ∗ ) = c}| = |{z ∗ ∈ Z2⊥ | σ(z ∗ ) = c}|

for all c ∈ Z, we have ζG1 (s) = ζG2 (s).


                                               26
Lemma 5.1: There exists an integer n and two injective homomorphisms

                                    φ1 , φ2 : F32 → Fn2

such that σ(φ1 (F32 )) and σ(φ2 (F32 )) are not conjugate in GLn (C) but for all c ∈ Z,

            |{x ∈ F32 | tr(σ(φ1 (x))) = c}| = |{x ∈ F32 | tr(σ(φ2 (x))) = c}|.



Proof: To guarantee non-conjugacy of images it suffices to arrange that the
character of σ ◦φ1 precomposed by any automorphism of F32 is distinct from the
character of σ ◦φ2 . To achieve this, we fix an injective function

                                      f1 : F32 → 8Z

such that
                                              X
                                   f1 (0) ≥          |f (x)|.
                                              x6=0

By Fourier inversion, f1 is the character of an effective representation ψ1 . Re-
garding it as a homomorphism to the diagonal matrices in GLn (C), we deduce
that there exists φ1 such that ψ1 = σ ◦φ1 . Composing any non-linear automor-
phism of the pointed set (F32 , 0) with f1 we obtain a new function f2 , therefore
a new representation ψ2 , and therefore a new homomorphism φ2 satisfying the
conditions of the lemma.                                                   ⊓
                                                                           ⊔

 Setting Zi = φi (F32 )⊥ and Gi = G/Zi , the lemma implies ζG1 (s) = ζG2 (s).
Moreover, G1 and G2 cannot be isomorphic; indeed an isomorphism ι would give
rise to an isomorphism ι̃ between universal covers, and therefore a diagram
                                              ι̃
                                G =G̃1     −→ G̃2 = G
                                    ↓          ↓
                                            ι
                                   G1      −→ G2 .

An inner automorphism is trivial on Z, so this means an element of Out(G) = Sn
sends Z1 to Z2 , contrary to Lemma 5.1. We conclude:

Theorem 5.2: There exist non-isomorphic compact semisimple Lie groups with
the same Witten zeta-function.
