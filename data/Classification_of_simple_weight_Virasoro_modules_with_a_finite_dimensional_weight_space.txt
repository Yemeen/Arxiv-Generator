                                                      We show that the support of a simple weight module over the
                                                  Virasoro algebra, which has an infinite-dimensional weight space, co-
                                                  incides with the weight lattice and that all non-trivial weight spaces
                                                  of such module are infinite dimensional. As a corollary we obtain that
                                                  every simple weight module over the Virasoro algebra, having a non-
                                                  trivial finite-dimensional weight space, is a Harish-Chandra module
                                                  (and hence is either a simple highest or lowest weight module or a
                                                  simple module from the intermediate series). This implies positive
                                                  answers to two conjectures about simple pointed and simple mixed
                                                  modules over the Virasoro algebra.


                                             1    Description of the results
                                             The Virasoro algebra V over an algebraically closed field, k, of characteristic
                                             zero has a basis, consisting of a central element, c, and elements ei , i ∈ Z,
                                             with the Lie bracket defined for the basis elements as follows:
                                                                                                     i3 − i
                                                                  [ei , ej ] = (j − i)ei+j + δi,−j          c.
                                                                                                       12
                                             The linear span of c and e0 is called the Cartan subalgebra H of V and an
                                             H-diagonalizable V-module is usually called a weight module. If, additionally,
                                             all weight spaces of a weight V-module are finite-dimensional, the module is
                                             called a Harish-Chandra module, see for example [M]. All simple Harish-
                                             Chandra modules were classified in [MP1, MP2, M] and are exhausted by
                                             simple highest weight modules, simple lowest weight modules and simple
                                             modules from the so-called intermediate series (see e.g. [M] for definitions).

                                                                                     1
    If M is a simple weight V-module, then c acts on M by a scalar, called
the central charge of M. Furthermore, M can be written as a direct sum of
its weight spaces, M = ⊕λ∈k Mλ , where Mλ is the set of all elements of M on
which e0 acts as the multiplication with λ. The set of all λ for which Mλ 6= 0
is called the support of M and is denoted by supp(M). Obviously, if M is a
simple weight V-module, then there exists λ ∈ k such that supp(M) ⊂ λ + Z.
A simple weight V-module, M, is called pointed provided that there exists
λ ∈ k such that dim Mλ = 1 (for example from the classification of simple
Harish-Chandra modules it follows that they all are pointed). The following
question was formulated in [Xu, Problem 3.3]:
    Question: Is any simple pointed V-module a Harish-Chandra module?
    A simple weight V-module, M, is called mixed provided that there exist
λ ∈ k and k ∈ Z such that dim Mλ = ∞ and dim Mλ+k < ∞. The follow-
ing conjecture, a positive answer to which implies a positive answer to the
question above, was formulated in [Maz, Conjecture 1]:
    Conjecture: There are no simple mixed V-modules.
    In the present paper we prove the following result, which implies positive
answers to both the Question and the Conjecture above:
Theorem 1. Let M be a simple weight V-module. Assume that there exists
λ ∈ k such that dim Mλ = ∞. Then supp(M) = λ + Z and for every k ∈ Z
we have dim Mλ+k = ∞.
   Apart from the positive answers to the Question and the Conjecture
above, Theorem 1 also implies the following classification of all simple weight
V-modules which admit a non-trivial finite-dimensional weight space:
Corollary 2. Let M be a simple weight V-module. Assume that there exists
λ ∈ k such that 0 < dim Mλ < ∞. Then M is a Harish-Chandra module.
Consequently, M is either a simple highest or lowest weight module or a
simple module from the intermediate series.
    The paper is organized as follow: Theorem 1 is proved in Section 2 and
in Section 3 we discuss the corollaries from this theorem.

2    Proof of Theorem 1
Our strategy to prove Theorem 1 is the following: first we show in Lemma 3
that a simple weight V-module with an infinite-dimensional weight space
can have at most one weight space of finite dimension in the weight lattice.
Then in Lemma 5 we show that this finite-dimensional weight must belong
to {−1, 0, 1}. These three cases are excluded in Lemma 6 and Lemma 7
by a case-by-case analysis. The key point of our proof is Lemma 4, which
is an easy technical statement claiming that some special element from the
universal enveloping algebra U(V) annihilates certain elements of the module.
The statement is very easy to prove by a direct computation, however, the
main and perhaps most non-trivial idea of the paper is that there should
exist an element in the universal enveloping algebra U(V), which satisfies
the conclusion of Lemma 4.
   Let M be a simple weight V-module. We start with the following obvious
observation:
Principal Observation: Assume that there exists µ ∈ k and a non-zero
element, v ∈ Mµ , such that e1 v = e2 v = 0 or e−1 v = e−2 v = 0. Then M is a
Harish-Chandra module.

Proof. Indeed, under these conditions v is either a highest or a lowest weight
vector and hence M is either a highest or a lowest weight module. Hence M
is a Harish-Chandra module (see e.g. [M]).
   Assume now that M is a simple weight V-module and that there exists
λ ∈ k such that dim Mλ = ∞.
Lemma 3. There exists at most one i ∈ Z such that dim Mλ+i < ∞.
Proof. Assume that dim Mλ+i < ∞ and dim Mλ+j < ∞ for different i, j ∈ Z.
Without loss of generality we may assume i = 1 and j > 1. Let V denote
the intersection of the kernels of the linear maps e1 : Mλ → Mλ+1 and
ej : Mλ → Mλ+j . Since dim Mλ = ∞, dim Mλ+1 < ∞ and dim Mλ+j < ∞,
we have dim V = ∞. Since [e1 , ek ] = (k − 1)ek+1 6= 0 for all k > 1, and j > 1,
inductively we get

                ek V = 0    for all   k = 1, j, j + 1, j + 2, . . . .      (2.1)

   (Here we cannot directly use the well known [M, Lemma 1.5] to deduce
that M is a highest weight module). If there would exist 0 6= v ∈ V such
that e2 v = 0, then e1 v = e2 v = 0 and M would be a Harish-Chandra module
by the Principal Observation. A contradiction. Hence e2 v 6= 0 for all v ∈ V .

                                       3
In particular, dim e2 V = ∞. Since dim Mλ+1 < ∞, there exists 0 6= w ∈ e2 V
such that e−1 w = 0. Let w = e2 u for some u ∈ V . For all k > j, using (2.1)
we have
              ek w = ek e2 u = e2 ek u + (2 − k)ek+2 u = 0 + 0 = 0.
Hence ek w = 0 for all k = −1, j, j+1, j+2, . . . . Since [e−1 , el ] = (l+1)el−1 6= 0
for all l > 1, inductively we get ek w = 0 for all k = 1, 2, . . . . Hence M is a
Harish-Chandra module by the Principal Observation. A contradiction. The
statement follows.
    Because of Lemma 3 we can now fix the following notation until the end of
this section: M is a simple weight V-module, µ ∈ k is such that dim Mµ < ∞
and dim Mµ+i = ∞ for every i ∈ Z \ {0}.

Lemma 4. Let 0 6= v ∈ Mµ−1 be such that e1 v = 0. Then

                              (e31 − 6e2 e1 + 6e3 )e2 v = 0.

Proof.

  (e31 − 6e2 e1 + 6e3 )e2 v = (e31 e2 − 6e2 e1 e2 + 6e3 e2 )v =
         (e2 e31 + 3e3 e21 + 6e4 e1 + 6e5 − 6e22 e1 − 6e3 e2 − 6e5 + 6e3 e2 )v =
                           (e2 e31 + 3e3 e21 + 6e4 e1 − 6e22 e1 )v = [using e1 v = 0] = 0.



Lemma 5. µ ∈ {−1, 0, 1}.

Proof. Let V denote the kernel of e1 : Mµ−1 → Mµ . Since dim Mµ−1 =
∞ and dim Mµ < ∞ we have dim V = ∞. For any v ∈ V consider the
element e2 v. By the Principal Observation, e2 v = 0 would imply that M
is a Harish-Chandra module, a contradiction. Hence e2 v 6= 0, in particular,
dim e2 V = ∞. This implies that there exists w ∈ e2 V such that w 6= 0 and
e−1 w = 0. From Lemma 4 we have (e31 − 6e2 e1 + 6e3 )w = 0, in particular,
e3−1 (e31 − 6e2 e1 + 6e3 )w = 0. However, by a direct calculation we obtain

         e3−1 (e31 − 6e2 e1 + 6e3 ) = 48e30 − 144e20 + 96e0      mod U(V)e−1 .

This implies (48e30 − 144e20 + 96e0 )w = 0. But w ∈ Mµ+1 , which implies
e0 w = (µ + 1)w, and hence (µ + 1)3 − 3(µ + 1)2 + 2(µ + 1) = 0, that is
µ ∈ {−1, 0, 1}.

Lemma 6. µ ∈ {−1, 1} is not possible.


                                             4
Proof. We show that µ = 1 is not possible and for µ = −1 the statement will
follow by applying the canonical involution on V. Assume µ = 1 and denote
by V the infinite-dimensional kernel of the linear map e1 : M0 → M1 . For
v ∈ V , using e1 v = e0 v = 0 we have

                     e1 e−1 v = e−1 e1 v − 2e0 v = 0 + 0 = 0.                (2.2)

Hence if e−1 V would be infinite-dimensional, there would exist 0 6= w ∈
e−1 V such that e1 w = 0 (by (2.2)) and e2 w = 0 (since dim V1 < ∞). The
Principal Observation then would imply that M is a Harish-Chandra module,
a contradiction. Hence dim e−1 V < ∞. This means that the kernel W of the
linear map e−1 : V → M−1 is infinite-dimensional. For every x ∈ W we have


    e1 e−2 x = e−2 e1 x − 3e−1 x = [using e−1 x = e1 x = 0] = 0 + 0 = 0.     (2.3)

If there would exist 0 6= x ∈ W such that e−2 x = 0, then we would have
e−2 x = e−1 x = 0 and the Principal Observation would imply that M is
a Harish-Chandra module, a contradiction. Thus dim e−2 W = ∞. Let H
denote the kernel of the linear map e3 : e−2 W → M1 . Since dim e−2 W = ∞
and dim M1 < ∞, we have dim H = ∞. For every y ∈ H we also have
e1 y = 0 by (2.3), implying by induction that ek H = 0 for all k = 1, 3, 4, . . . .
    If e2 h = 0 for some 0 6= h ∈ H then the Principal Observation implies
that M is a Harish-Chandra module, a contradiction. Hence dim e2 H = ∞.
For every h ∈ H and k > 3 we have

   ek e2 h = e2 ek h + (2 − k)ek+2 h = [using ei h = 0 for i > 3] = 0 + 0 = 0.

Hence ek e2 H = 0 for all k > 3. Let, finally, K denote the infinite-dimensional
kernel of the linear map e1 : e2 H → M1 . If e2 z = 0 for some 0 6= z ∈ K
then the Principal Observation implies that M is a Harish-Chandra module,
a contradiction. Hence dim e2 z 6= 0 for all z ∈ K. For every z ∈ K and
k > 3 we have

    ek e2 z = e2 ek z + (2 − k)ek+2 z = [using ei z = 0 for i > 3] = 0 + 0 = 0.

Hence ek e2 K = 0 for all k > 3. At the same time, since dim e2 K = ∞ and
dim M1 < ∞, we can find some 0 6= t ∈ e2 K such that e−1 t = 0. By induction
we get ei t = 0 for all i > 0 and thus M is a Harish-Chandra module by the
Principal Observation. This last contradiction completes the proof.
   Now the proof of Theorem 1 follows from the following lemma:
Lemma 7. µ = 0 is not possible.

                                        5
Proof. Define

  V = Ker(e1 : M−1 → M0 ) ∩ Ker(e−1 e2 : M−1 → M0 )∩
                                           ∩ Ker(e1 e−2 e2 : M−1 → M0 ),


  W = Ker(e−1 : M1 → M0 ) ∩ Ker(e1 e−2 : M1 → M0 )∩
                                           ∩ Ker(e−1 e2 e−2 : M1 → M0 ).

Since dim M−1 = ∞ and dim M0 < ∞, V is a vector subspace of finite
codimension in M−1 . Since dim M1 = ∞ and dim M0 < ∞, W is a vector
subspace of finite codimension in M1 . In order not to get a direct contradic-
tion using the Principal Observation, we assume e2 v 6= 0 for all 0 6= v ∈ V
and e−2 w 6= 0 for all 0 6= w ∈ W . Then dim e2 V = ∞ and, by Lemma 4, for
every 0 6= v ∈ V we have (e31 − 6e2 e1 + 6e3 )e2 v = 0.
    Since the codimension of W in M1 is finite, the intersection W ′ = e2 V ∩W
is infinite-dimensional. Note that

e−1 (e31 − 6e2 e1 + 6e3 ) = 6e21 e0 + 6e21 − 12e2 e0 − 18e21 + 24e2   mod U(V)e−1 .

Choose v ∈ V such that wv := e2 v ∈ W ′ \ {0}. The equality e−1 (e31 − 6e2 e1 +
6e3 )e2 v = 0 implies that (2e2 − e21 )wv = 0. In particular, for this v we have
e−2 (2e2 − e21 )wv = 0. However,

              e−2 (2e2 − e21 ) = 2e2 e−2 + 2e0 − c − e21 e−2 − 6e1 e−1 ,

and since e1 e−2 wv = e−1 wv = 0 by assumptions, we get e2 e−2 wv = τ wv for
some τ ∈ k. In order not to get a direct contradiction using the Principal
Observation, we must assume e−2 wv 6= 0. Since e1 e−2 wv = 0, we also must
assume e2 e−2 wv 6= 0, that is τ 6= 0.
   Denote y = wv and x = e−2 y. Let us sum up, what we know about x and
y:
                 e1 x = 0, e−1 y = 0, x = e−2 y, τ y = e2 x.           (2.4)
Let U+ and U− denote the subalgebras of U(V), generated by e1 , e2 and
e−1 , e−2 respectively. Consider the vector space

                              N = U− x ⊕ U+ y ⊂ M.

From the definition it follows that both U+ and U− are stable under the
adjoint action of e0 . Since both x and y are eigenvectors for e0 , we derive
that N decomposes into a direct sum of weight spaces which are obviously
finite-dimensional. Hence, to complete the proof we have just to show that

                                          6
N is stable under the action of the whole V. Since V is generated by e1 , e−1 ,
e2 , e−2 , it is enough to show that N is stable under the action of these four
operators. Because of the symmetry of our situation, it is even enough to
show that N is stable under the action of, say e1 and e2 .
      That e1 U+ y ⊂ U+ y and e2 U+ y ⊂ U+ y is clear. Let us show that e1 U− x ⊂
U− x. For any a ∈P      U− we have e1 ax = ae1 x + [e1 , a]x. By (2.4), ae1 x = 0.
Further, [e1 , a] = i,j ai,j ei0 cj for some ai,j ∈ U− . Since x ∈ M−1 , we have
ei0 cj x = ξx for some ξ ∈ k. Therefore [e1 , a]x ∈ U− x, which means that e1
preserves U− x and hence N.
      Finally, let us show that e2 U− x ⊂ N. For any a ∈ U− we have e2 ax =
ae2 x + [e2 , a]x. By (2.4), e2 x = τ y 6= 0. Let A = ei1 . . . eil be a monomial,
where is ∈ {−1, −2} for all s = 1, . . . , l. If il = −1 we have Ae2 x = 0 since
e−1 y = 0. If il = −2 we have Ae2 x = ζei1 . . . eil−1 x ∈ U− x for some ζ ∈ k
by (2.4). This implies that ae2 x ∈ N. Let us write the element [e2 , a] in
the PBW basis corresponding to the order . . . , e−2 , e−1 , e0 , c, e1 . By (2.4),
e1 x = 0, andP hence all terms, which end on e1 will vanish. This means that
[e2 , a]x = i,j ai,j ei0 cj x for some ai,j ∈ U− . In the previous paragraph it was
shown that in this case [e2 , a]x ∈ U− x. This completes the proof.


3     Corollaries from Theorem 1
As an immediate corollary from Theorem 1 we have:
Corollary 8. Let M be a simple weight V-module. Assume that there exists
λ ∈ k such that 0 < dim Mλ < ∞. Then M is a Harish-Chandra module.
Consequently, M is either a simple highest or lowest weight module or a
simple module from the intermediate series.
Proof. Assume that this M is not a Harish-Chandra module. Then there
should exists i ∈ Z such that dim Mλ+i = ∞. In this case Theorem 1 implies
dim Mλ = ∞, a contradiction. Hence M is a Harish-Chandra module, and
the rest of the statement follows from [M, Theorem 1].
    The following corollary gives a positive answer to [Xu, Problem 3.3]:
Corollary 9. Every pointed V-module is a Harish-Chandra module.
Proof. Every pointed module satisfies the conditions of Corollary 8 by defi-
nition. Hence the statement follows from Corollary 8.
    The following corollary gives a positive answer to [Maz, Conjecture 1]:
Corollary 10. There are no simple mixed V-modules.

                                        7
Proof. Let M be a simple mixed V-module. Then, by the definition, there
exists λ ∈ k and i ∈ Z such that dim Mλ = ∞ and dim Mλ+i < ∞. However,
Theorem 1 implies dim Mλ+i = ∞. A contradiction.
