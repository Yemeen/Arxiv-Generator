                                                     Let F be a local non-archimedean field and let G be the group of
                                                 F -valued points of a reductive algebraic group over F. In this paper
                                                 we compute the Ext-groups of generalized Steinberg representations in
                                                 the category of smooth G-representations with coefficients in a certain
                                                 self-injective ring.



                                            1    Introduction

                                            The origin of the problem we treat here is the computation of the étale
                                            cohomology of p-adic period domains with finite coefficients. In [O] the com-
                                            putation yields a filtration of smooth representations of a p-adic Lie group
                                            on the cohomology groups, which is induced by a certain spectral sequence.
                                            A natural problem which arises in this context is to show that this filtration
                                            splits canonically. The graded pieces of the filtration are essentially gener-
                                            alized Steinberg representations. A natural task is therefore to study the
                                            extensions of these representations.
                                               Let F be a local non-archimedean field and let G be the group of F -valued
                                            points of a fixed reductive algebraic group over F. The field F induces a
                                            natural topology on G providing it with the structure of a locally profinite
                                            group. The aim of this paper is to determine the Ext-groups of generalized
                                            Steinberg representations in the category of smooth G-representations with
                                            coefficients in a self-injective ring R. We refer to the next chapter for the
                                            precise conditions we impose on R. An important example of such a ring is
                                            given by a field of characteristic zero. One crucial assumption is that the
                                            pro-order of G is invertible in R. In [V1] it is shown that this condition is

                                                                                   1
sufficient for the existence of a (left-invariant) normalized Haar measure on
G. Using this Haar measure and the self-injectivity of R ensures all the well-
known properties and techniques in representation- and cohomology theory
of a p-adic reductive group, e.g. Frobenius reciprocity, exactness of the fixed
point functor for a compact open subgroup of G etc., as in the classical case
where R = C. In particular we have enough injective and projective objects
in the category of smooth G-representations.
    The generalized Steinberg representations are parametrized by the subsets
of a relative Qp -root basis ∆ of G. For any subset I ⊂ ∆, let PI ⊂ G the
                                                                ∞
corresponding standard-parabolic subgroup of G. Let iG   PI = C (PI \G) be
the G-representation consisting of locally constant functions on PI \G with
values in R. If J ⊃ I is another subset, then there is a natural injection
iG      G
 PJ ֒→ iPI . The generalized Steinberg representation with respect to I ⊂ ∆
is the quotient                           X
                             vPGI = iG
                                     PI /     iG
                                               PJ .
                                              I⊂J ⊂∆
                                               I6=J

In the case I = ∅ we just get the ordinary Steinberg representation. In
the case R = C it is known that the representations vPGJ , for J ⊃ I, are
precisely the irreducible subquotients of iG
                                           PI . Our main result is formulated
in the following theorem.

Theorem 1 Let G be semi-simple. Let I, J ⊂ ∆. Then
                              
              i  G     G        R : i = |I ∪ J| − |I ∩ J|
          ExtG (vPI , vPJ ) =                             .
                                0 : otherwise

Note that in the case where I or J is the empty set, i.e., vPGI or vPGJ is the trivial
representation and R is the field of complex numbers, this computation has
been carried out by Casselman [Ca1], [Ca2] resp. Borel and Wallach [BW]. If
on the other extreme I = ∆ or J = ∆, the Ext-groups have been computed
by Schneider and Stuhler [SS].
   If G is not necessarily semi-simple then we also have a contribution of the
center Z(G) of G. By using a Hochschild-Serre argument we conclude from
Theorem 1:

Corollary 2 Let G be reductive with center Z(G) of Qp -rank d. Let I, J ⊂ ∆.
Then we have
                             (
             i  G     G        R (dj) : i = |I ∪ J| − |I ∩ J| + j
         ExtG (vPI , vPJ ) =
                                    0 : otherwise


                                          2
   During my computations I was informed by J.-F. Dat that he was also
able to prove Theorem 1. His proof [D] is totally different from ours. It is
based on intertwining operators and Bernstein’s second adjunction formula.
In addition to the fact that R need not to be self-injective, his proof has the
advantage of producing the extensions of generalized Steinberg representa-
tions explicitly.
   Our proof of Theorem 1 is quite natural. One uses certain resolutions of
the representations vPGI in terms of the induced representations iG    PK , where
K ⊃ I. By a spectral sequence argument, the proof reduces to the compu-
tation of the groups Ext∗G (iG     G
                             PI , iPJ ), for I, J ⊂ ∆. This is done by Frobenius
reciprocity and a description of the Jacquet modules for these kind of rep-
resentations. The latter has been considered in [Ca3] in the case R = C. It
holds more generally in our situation.
   I am grateful to J.-F. Dat for his numerous remarks on this paper. He
explained to me how to genaralize my proof from the case R = C to the case
of a certain self-injective ring. I would like to thank the IHES and J.-F. Dat
for the invitation in June 2003. I wish to thank A. Huber and M. Rapoport
for helpful remarks. I also thank T. Wedhorn and P. Schneider for their
comments on a first version of this paper. Finally, I would like to thank C.
Kaiser for pointing out to me Corollary 18 as a consequence of the results
above.



2     Notations

Let p be a prime number and let F be a local non-archimedean field. We
suppose that the residue field of F has order q = pr , r ≥ 0. Let val : F → Z
be the discrete valuation taking a fixed uniformizer ̟F ∈ F to 1 ∈ Z. Denote
by | |R : F → R the corresponding normalized p-adic norm with values in R.
   Let G be a reductive algebraic group over F. Fix a maximal F -split torus
S and a minimal F -parabolic subgroup P in G containing S. Let M = Z(S)
be the centralizer of S in G, which is a Levi subgroup of P. Denote by U
the unipotent radical of P. Let

                         Φ ⊃ Φ+ ⊃ ∆ = {α1 , . . . , αn }

be the corresponding subsets of relative F -roots, F -positive roots, F -simple
roots. In the following, we call them for simplicity just roots instead of
relative F -roots. For a subset I ⊂ ∆, we let PI ⊂ G be the standard

                                       3
parabolic subgroup defined over F such that ∆ \ I are precisely the simple
roots of the unipotent radical UI of PI . Thus we have

                           P∆ = G and P∅ = P

as extreme cases. Moreover, we have for each subset I ⊂ ∆ a unique Levi
subgroup MI of PI which contains M. Let

                                ΦI ⊃ Φ+
                                      I ⊃ I

be its set of roots, positive roots, simple roots with respect to S ⊂ MI ∩ P.
We denote by
                                W = N(S)/Z(S)
the relative Weylgroup of G. For any subset I ⊂ ∆, let WI be the parabolic
subgroup of W which is generated by the reflections associated to I. It coin-
cides with the Weylgroup of MI . Thus we have

                          W∆ = W and W∅ = {1}.

If H is any linear algebraic group defined over F , then we denote by X ∗ (H)F
its group of F -rational characters.
  Whereas we denote algebraic groups defined over F by boldface letters,
we use ordinary letters for their groups

                G := G(F ), PI := PI (F ), MI := MI (F ), . . .

of F -valued points. We supply these groups with the canonical topology
given by F. These are locally profinite topological groups. Let M ⊂ G be a
Levi subgroup. Put                 \
                         0
                           M=             kern|α|R .
                                 α∈X ∗ (M)F

This is a normal open subgroup generated by all compact subgroups of M
(cf. [BW] ch. X 2.2). Moreover, the quotient M/0 M is a finitely generated
free abelian group of rank equal to the F -rank of Z(M). The valuation map
gives rise to a natural homomorphism of groups

                  ΘM : X ∗ (M)F −→ Hom(M/0 M, Z)                           (1)

defined by Θ(χ) = val ◦ χ(F ), where χ(F ) : M → F × is the induced homo-
morphism on F -valued points. It is easily seen that ΘM is injective. Further
the source and the target of ΘM are both free Z-modules of the same rank.
Thus we may identify X ∗ (M)F as a lattice in Hom(M/0 M, Z).

                                       4
   We fix a self-injective ring R, i.e., R is an injective object in the category
ModR of R-modules. Let i : Z → R be the canonical homomorphism. Then
we have ker(i) = dZ, for some integer d ∈ N. We suppose that R fulfills the
following assumptions.

   1. The pro-order |G| of G is invertible in R, i.e., |G| is prime to d (see
      [V1] for the definition of the pro-order). In particular i(q) ∈ R× .
   2. Let
                            ρ = det AdLie(U) |S ∈ X ∗ (S)F
      be the character given by the determinant of the adjoint representation
      of P on Lie(U) restricted to S. Write ρ in the shape
                                        X
                                   ρ=      nα α,
                                            α∈∆

      where nα ∈ N. Following the definition of an algebraically closed field
      which is bon for G (see [D]), we impose on R that d is prime to
                                    Y
                                           (1 − q r ).
                                r≤sup{nα ; α∈∆}


   3. Let E/F be a finite Galois splitting field of G. Then we further sup-
      pose that d is prime to the order of the Galois group Gal(E/F ), i.e,
      i(|Gal(E/F )|) ∈ R× .
   4. Finally we assume that the monomorphism ΘMI becomes an isomor-
      phism after base change to R for all I ⊂ ∆.

Remarks: (1) Examples of such rings are given by fields of characteristic
zero or by R = Z/nZ with n ∈ N suitable chosen.
(2) If R is an algebraically closed field, then condition 1 corresponds to the
case banal in the sense of Vignéras (see [V1]).
   Suppose for the moment that G is an arbitrary locally profinite group. We
agree that all G-representations (sometimes we use the term G-module as
well) in this paper are defined over R. Recall that a smooth G-representation
is a representation V of G such that each v ∈ V is fixed by a compact
subgroup K ⊂ G. We denote the category of smooth representations by
ModG . If V is a smooth G-module, then we let Ve be its smooth dual. Any
closed subgroup H of G gives rise to functors

                          iG      G
                           H , c-iH : ModH → ModG


                                        5
called the (unnormalized) induction resp. induction with compact support.
We recall their definitions. Let W be a smooth H-representation. Then we
have
               n
  iG
   H (W )  :=    f : G → W ; f (hg) = h · f (g) ∀h ∈ H, g ∈ G, ∃ compact
                                                                         o
                open subgroup Kf ⊂ G s.t. f (gk) = f (g) ∀g ∈ G, k ∈ Kf

resp.
                   n                                                     o
   c-iG
      H (W ) :=        f ∈ iG
                            H (W ); the support of f is compact modulo H  .

Note that we have
                                    iG      G
                                     H = c-iH ,

if H\G is compact. If furthermore W is admissible, i.e., W K is of finite type
over R for all compact open subgroups K ⊂ G, then iG     H (W ) is admissible as
well (loc.cit., I, 5.6). Finally, we denote for any G-module V by V G resp. VG
the invariants resp. the coinvariants of V with respect to G.
   Next, we want to recall the definition of the generalized Steinberg repre-
sentations. Let 1 be the trivial representation of any locally profinite group.
For a subset I ⊂ ∆, let
                                                 ∞
                   iG      G           G
                    PI := iPI (1) = c-iPI (1) = C (PI \G, R)

be the admissible representation of locally constant functions on PI \G with
values in R. If ∆ ⊃ J ⊃ I is another subset, then there is an injection
iG      G
 PJ ֒→ iPI which is induced by the natural surjection PI \G → PJ \G. The
generalized Steinberg representation of G with respect to I ⊂ ∆ is defined
to be the quotient                       X
                           vPGI := iG
                                    PI /      iG
                                               PJ .
                                            I⊂J ⊂∆
                                             J 6=I


In the case R = C it has been shown that the generalized Steinberg repre-
sentations are irreducible and not pairwise isomorphic for different I ⊂ ∆
(cf. [Ca2] Thm 1.1). This result has been generalized by J.-F. Dat [D] to the
case of an algebraically closed field which is bon and banal for G.
  We finish this section with introducing some more notations. We fix a
normalized left-invariant R-valued Haar measure µ on G with respect to a
maximal compact open subgroup of G. The existence of such a Haar measure



                                        6
is guaranteed by assumption (1) on R (see [V1] I, 2.4). Further, we denote
by | | : F → R the ’norm’ given by the composition of
                               F −→ q Z
                               x 7→ q −val(x)
together with the natural homomorphism Z[ 1q ] → R. Finally, if H is any
linear algebraic group over F , then we put
                           X(H) := X ∗ (H)F ⊗Z R.


3     The computation
Let G be an arbitrary locally profinite group which satisfies assumption 1 on
R. We want to recall that the category ModG of smooth G-representations
has then enough injectives and projectives [V1]. This fact provides two dif-
ferent choices for the computation of the Ext-groups Ext∗G (V, W ), for a given
pair of smooth G-representations V, W. Notice that
                           H i (G, V ) = ExtiG (1, V )
is the ith right derived functor of
                                ModG → ModR
                                      V 7→ V G ,
whereas Hi (G, V ) denotes the ith left derived functor of the right exact func-
tor
                               ModG → ModR
                                      V 7→ VG .
Since R is self-injective, it is easy to see that there is an isomorphism
                           Hi (G, V )∨ = ExtiG (V, 1)
                                                                              ∨
for all smooth G-representations V and for all i ≥ 0. Here the symbol
indicates the R-dual space.
   For our proof of Theorem 1, we need some statements on the cohomology
of smooth representations of locally profinite groups with values in R. Up to
Lemma 14 all the statements are well-known in the classical case, i.e., where
R = C. Their proofs in our situation are essentially the same. But for being
on the safe side, we are going to reproduce the arguments shortly. Up to
Lemma 7 - except of Lemma 4 - G is an arbitrary locally profinite group
satisfying assumption 1 on R.

Lemma 3 Let K ⊂ G be an open compact subgroup. Then iG
                                                     K (1) is an
injective object in ModG .

Proof: By [V1] I, 4.10 we know that the trivial K-representation 1 is an
injective object. Since the induction functor respects injectives (loc.cit. I,
5.9 (b)), we obtain the claim.                                              
   Let Y be the Bruhat-Tits building of G over F. We denote by C q (Y ), q ∈
N, the space of q-cochains on Y with values in R. As in the classical case we
have the following fact:

             0 → R → C 0 (Y ) → C 1 (Y ) → . . . → C q (Y ) → . . . .
is an injective resolution of the trivial G-representation 1 by smooth G-
modules.

Proof: The proof coincides with the proof of [BW] ch. X 1.11 which uses
Lemma 3 and the contractibility of the Bruhat-Tits building Y.       
   Our next lemma deals with the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Let
N ⊂ G be a closed subgroup. As it has been pointed out by Casselman
in [Ca2], the restriction functor from the category of smooth G-modules to
that of N-modules does not preserve injective objects. For this reason, the
standard arguments for proving the existence of the Hochschild-Serre spectral
sequence - as in the case of cohomology theory of groups - breaks down.
Nevertheless, the restriction functor preserves projective objects giving a
homological variant of the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence (see appendix
of [Ca2]).

Lemma 5 Let N ⊂ G be a closed normal subgroup of G. If V is a projective
G-module, then VN is a projective G/N−module. Thus we get for every
pair of smooth G-modules V, W, such that N acts trivially on W, a spectral
sequence
              E2p,q = ExtqG/N (Hp (N, V ), W ) ⇒ Extp+q
                                                    G (V, W ).

If furthermore N resp. G/N is compact, then we have
                   ExtqG/N (VN , W ) = ExtqG (V, W ) ∀q ∈ N,
resp.
               Ext0G/N (Hp (N, V ), W ) = ExtpG (V, W ) ∀p ∈ N.

                                        8
Proof: The proof is the same as in the classical case [Ca2] A.9. It starts
with the observation that the coinvariant functor is left adjoint to the triv-
ial (exact) functor viewing a smooth G/N-module as a smooth G-module.
Therefore, VN is a projective G/N-module, if V is projective. By [V1] I,
5.10 we know that the restriction functor preserves projectives. Using the
standard-arguments applied to the Grothendieck spectral sequence, we ob-
tain the first part of the claim. The reason for the second part is the exactness
of the coinvariant resp. fixed-point functor for a compact subgroup [V1] I,
4.6.                                                                           


Lemma 6 Let V and W be smooth representations of G. Suppose that W is
admissible. Then there are isomorphisms

                     ExtiG (V, W ) ∼        f , Ve ), ∀i ≥ 0.
                                   = ExtiG (W


Proof: Let
                          0 ← V ← P0 ← P1 ← ···
be a projective resolution of V. Since R is self-injective, we conclude as
in [V1] I, 4.18 that the functor W 7→ W    f from the category of smooth G-
representations to itself is exact. By [V1] I, 4.13 (2) we see that the modules
Pej , j ≥ 0, are injective objects in ModG . Hence, we obtain an injective reso-
lution
                             0 → Ve → Pe0 → Pe 1 → . . .
of Ve . Moreover, we know by [V1] I, 4.13 (1) that

                                 f) = HomG (W, Ve ),
                        HomG (V, W

for any pair of smooth G-modules V, W. Since W is admissible, we have
      f
      f (see [V1] 4.18 (iii)) and the claim follows.
W =W                                                               
In the special case W = 1 we obtain:


Corollary 7 Let V be a smooth representation of G. Then there are isomor-
phisms
                    H i (G, Ve ) ∼
                                 = Hi (G, V )∨ , ∀i ≥ 0.


  From now on, we suppose again that G is the set of F -valued points of
some reductive algebraic group defined over F.

                                        9
Lemma 8 Let Q ⊂ G be a parabolic subgroup with Levi decomposition Q =
M · N. Let V resp. W be a smooth representation of G resp. M. Extend W
trivially to a representation of Q. Then we have for all i ≥ 0 isomorphisms

                      ExtiG (V, iG       ∼    i
                                 Q (W )) = ExtM (VN , W ).


Proof: By Frobenius reciprocity [V1] I, 5.10 we deduce that

                       Ext∗G (V, iG            ∗
                                  Q (W )) = ExtQ (V, W ).

Since N is a union of open compact subgroups, we deduce from [V1] I, 4.10
the exactness of the functor

                               ModG → ModR

                                  W 7→ WN .
Thus the statement follows from Lemma 5.                                      
   After having established the main techniques for computing cohomology
of representations, we are able to take the first step in order to proof Theorem
1. The following proposition is also well-known in the classical case.

Proposition 9 We have

                            H ∗ (G, 1) = Λ∗ X(G),

where Λ∗ X(G) denotes the exterior algebra of X(G).

Proof: We copy the proof of the classical case [BW] Prop. 2.6, ch. X.
   1st case: G is semi-simple and simply connected. Then we apply the G-
fixed point functor to the resolution of the trivial representation in Lemma
4. The result is a constant coefficient system on a base chamber inside the
Bruhat-Tits building, which is contractible. Thus, we obtain H ∗ (G, 1) =
H 0 (G, 1) = R.
   2nd case: G is semi-simple. Then we consider its simply connected covering
G′ → G. The induced homomorphism G′ → G has finite kernel, its image is
a closed cocompact normal subgroup. We apply Lemma 5 to G′ , σ(G′ ) and
N := ker(G′ → G).
  3rd case: G is arbitrary reductive. Let DG be the derived group of G and
put G′ = DG(F ). Then we have G ⊃ 0 G ⊃ DG′ . Moreover, the quotient

                                      10
0
 G/DG′ is compact, where DG′ denotes the derived group of G′ . Therefore,
we conclude by the previous case, Lemma 5 and Corollary 7 that

                  H ∗ (0 G, 1) = H ∗ (DG′ , 1) = H 0 (DG′ , 1) = R.

With the same arguments, we see that

                              H ∗ (G, 1) = H ∗ (G/0 G, 1).

Now it is known that the cohomology of a finite rank free commutative
(discrete) group L coincides with the cohomology of the corresponding torus:

                          H ∗ (L, 1) = Λ∗ (Hom(L, Z)) ⊗Z R.

Applying this fact to G/0 G, we get

                        H ∗ (G, 1) = Λ∗ (Hom(G/0 G, Z)) ⊗Z R.

By assumption 4 on R we have Hom(G/0 G, Z) ⊗Z R ∼
                                                = X(G) from which
the result follows.                                            

Corollary 10 Let I ⊂ ∆. Then we have

               H ∗ (G, iG       ∗            ∗            ∗
                        PI ) = H (PI , 1) = H (MI , 1) = Λ X(MI ).


Proof: The statement follows from Lemma 8, Proposition 9 and by our
assumption 4 on R.                                               
     In order to compute the cohomology of generalized Steinberg representa-
tions, we need the following proposition. For two subsets I ⊂ I ′ ⊂ ∆ with
|I ′ \ I| = 1, we let
                               pI,I ′ : iG        G
                                         PI ′ −→ iPI

be the natural homomorphism induced by the surjection G/PI → G/PI ′ . For
arbitrary subsets I, I ′ ⊂ ∆, with |I ′ | − |I| = 1 and I ′ = {β1 , . . . , βr }, we put
                              
                                (−1)i pI,I ′ I ′ = I ∪ {βi }
                     dI,I ′ =                                .
                                    0             I 6⊂ I ′

                                          11
Proof: See Prop. 13, §6 of [SS] for the case of I = {α1 , α2 , . . . , αi }, i ≥ 1,
and G = GLn . The proof there is only formulated for coefficients in the
ring of integers Z. However, the proof holds for arbitrary rings, since it is of
combinatorial nature.
A different approach consists of using Proposition 6 of §2 in [SS]. It says:
Let G1 , . . . , Gm be a family of subgroups in some bigger group G. Suppose
that the following identities are satisfied for all subsets A, B ⊂ {1, . . . , m}:
                       X           \        X         \
                     (    Gi ) ∩ (   Gj ) =   (Gi ∩ (    Gj )).
                       i∈A            j∈B         i∈A           j∈B

Then the natural (oriented) complex
                m
                M             m
                              M                     m
                                                    M
          G←           Gi ←           Gi ∩ Gj ←              Gi ∩ Gj ∩ Gk ← · · ·
                 i=1          i,j=1                i,j,k=1
                               i<j                 i<j<k

                             P
is an acyclic resolution of i Gi ⊂ G. We apply this proposition to the G-
modules iGPK , where I ⊂ K ⊂ ∆ and |∆ \ K| = 1. The condition of the
proposition is fulfilled. Indeed, we have
                                      iG     G     G
                                       PI ∩ iPJ = iPI∪J

                 PI ∩ (iPJ + iPK ) = (iPI ∩ iPJ ) + (iPI ∩ iPK ),

for all subsets I, J, K ⊂ ∆. The first identity follows from the fact that
PI∪J is the parabolic subgroup generated by PI and PJ . For the second one
confer [BW] 4.5, 4.6 resp. [L] 8.1, 8.1.4 (The statement there is formulated
in the case where R = C. The result holds also in our general situation. The
proof relies on the exactness of the Jacquet-functor and a description of the
S-modules (iG PI )U using the filtration in the proof of Proposition 15).  

Theorem 12 Let G be semi-simple and let I ⊂ ∆. Then we have
                              
                  i    G        R : i = |∆ \ I|
                H (G, vPI ) =
                                0 : otherwise

Proof: The proof is the same as in Prop. 4.7, ch. X of [BW]. A not very
different approach works as follows. Apply the cohomology functor H ∗ (G, −)
to the acyclic complex of Proposition 11. We obtain a complex
                   M                         M
0 → Λ∗ X(G) →          Λ∗ X(MK ) → . . . →        Λ∗ X(MK ) → Λ∗ X(MI ) → 0.

                                             12
Using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, we may assume without loss
of generality that G is simply connected. Suppose that G is split. In this
case it is well-known (cf. [J] ch II, 1.18 ) that X ∗ (MK )F may be identified
with the submodule of X ∗ (S)F defined by

                    {χ ∈ X ∗ (S)F ; hχ, α∨i = 0 ∀α ∈ K},

where h , i : X ∗ (S)F × X∗ (S)F → Z is the natural pairing. If we denote
by {ωα ∈ X ∗ (S)F ; α ∈ ∆} the fundamental weights of G with respect to
S ⊂ P, then we get
                                 M
                      X(MK ) ∼=      R · ωα ⊂ X(S).
                                 α∈∆\K


Thus we see - again by using Prop. 6, §2 of [SS] - that the complex above is
acyclic with respect to Λr for

                         r < rk(Z(MI )) = |∆ \ I|.

In the case rk(Z(MI )) = r all the entries of the complex vanish except of
Λr X(MI ) = R.
In the general case, let E/F be our fixed Galois splitting field of G. Then
we deduce with the same arguments that the corresponding complex of E-
rational characters has the desired property. Applying the Gal(E/F )-fixed
point functor to this complex yields the claim. Note that the fixed point
functor is exact by assumption 3 on R.                                   
For attacking Theorem 1 we still need two lemmas.


Lemma 13 Let V be a smooth representation of G. Suppose that there exists
an element z ∈ Z(G) in the center of G and an element c ∈ R, such that
c − 1 ∈ R× and z · v = c · v for all v ∈ V. Then we have

                               H ∗ (G, V ) = 0.


Proof: See Prop. 4.2, ch. X [BW] for the classical case. We repeat shortly
the argument. By identifying Ext-groups with the Yoneda-Ext-groups, we
have to show that for all n ∈ N, all n-extensions of 1 by V are trivial. More
generally, we will show that if U is a R-module with trivial G-action, then
there are no non-trivial extensions of U by V. In fact, let

              E• : 0 → V → E1 → E2 → · · · → En → U → 0

                                     13
be an arbitrary n−extension. Since z lies in the center of G, it defines an
endomorphism of E • and we get the identity E • = c.E • . Here c.E • denotes
the scalar multiplication of R on the module ExtnG (U, V ) (confer [M] ch. III,
Theorem 2.1). Thus, we have 0 = E • − c.E • = (1 − c).E • . Since 1 − c ∈ R× ,
we conclude that E • = 0 ∈ ExtnG (U, V ).                                    


Lemma 14 Let H ⊂ G be a closed subgroup and let W be a smooth repre-
sentation of H. Then we have

                           c −^
                              iG      ∼ G f
                               H (W ) = iH (W δH ),

where δH is the modulus character of H.


Proof: This follows from [V1] I, 5.11 together with the fact that G is uni-
modular.                                                                 


Proposition 15 Let G be semi-simple and let I, J ⊂ ∆. Then we have

Proof: By Lemma 8 we have for all i ≥ 0 isomorphisms

                     ExtiG (iG     G    ∼    i     G
                             PI , iPJ ) = ExtMJ ((iPI )UJ , 1),

where (iG                                 G
         PI )UJ is the Jacquet-module of iPI with respect to MJ . In the case
R = C there is constructed in [Ca3] 6.3 - a substitute for the Mackey formula
- a decreasing N-filtration F • of smooth PJ -submodules on iG PI defined by
                                             [

Here the length l(w) of a double coset w ∈ WI \W/WJ is the length of its
Kostant-representative which is the one of minimal length within its double

where γw is the modulus character of PJ ∩w −1 PI w acting on UJ /UJ ∩w −1 PI w.
The first isomorphism is a corollary of Prop. 6.3.1 (loc.cit.) (see also [V1] I,
1.7 (iii)), whereas the second one is the content of Prop. 6.3.3 (loc.cit.). In
the general case, i.e., for our specified ring R, the same formulas hold, since
the proof can be taken over word by word. Since MJ ∩ w −1 PI w is a parabolic
subgroup in MJ , we observe that c-iM                          MJ

                                          J


the definition we see that γw is the norm of the rational character

         det AdLie(UJ ) / det Adw−1 Lie(PI )w∩Lie(UJ ) ∈ X ∗ (PJ ∩ w −1 PI w).

Its restriction to S is given by

Fix an element w ∈ WI \W/WJ . We are going to show that

                          Ext∗MJ (iM
                                   MJ ∩w −1 PI w (γw ), 1) = 0,
                                     J




unless w = 1 and J ⊂ I. Since the Jacquet-functor is exact, this will give by
successive application of the long exact cohomology sequence with respect to
the filtration F • the statement of our proposition. By Lemma 6 and Lemma
14 we conclude that

    Ext∗MJ (c-iM                       ∼    ∗       MJ
               MJ ∩w −1 PI w (γw ), 1) = ExtMJ (1, iMJ ∩w −1 PI w (γ̃w δMJ ∩w PI w )),
                 J
                                                                             −1



where δMJ ∩w−1 PI w is the modulus character of the parabolic subgroup MJ ∩ w −1 PI w
of MJ and γ̃w is the smooth dual of γw . The Levi decomposition of the latter
group is given by

                   MJ ∩ w −1PI w = MJ∩w−1 I · (MJ ∩ w −1 UI w)

(see [C] Prop. 2.8.9.). So, the restriction of δMJ ∩w−1 PI w to S is the norm of
the rational character               Y

i.e.,
                                               Y
                      δMJ ∩w−1 PI w |S = |               α|.              (3)

In the case where J 6⊂ I or w 6= 1 we deduce from the following lemma the
existence of an element z in the center of MJ∩w−1 I , such that

                       γ̃w (z)δMJ ∩w−1 PI w (z) − 1 ∈ R× .

By Lemma 13 we conclude that

                      Ext∗MJ (c-iM
                                 MJ ∩w −1 PI w (γw ), 1) = 0.
                                   J



In the case J ⊂ I we obtain therefore an isomorphism

                 Ext∗G (iG     G    ∼    ∗            ∗
                         PI , iPJ ) = ExtMJ (1, 1) = Λ X(MJ )

which is induced by the element w = 1.                                     

Lemma 16 Let J 6⊂ I or w 6= 1. Then there exists an element z ∈
Z(MJ∩w−1 I ) such that γ̃w (z)δMJ ∩w−1 PI w (z) − 1 ∈ R× .

Proof: 1st case: Let w 6= 1. Then we have γw 6= 1. In fact, γw = 1 would
imply that
                         Lie(UJ ) ⊂ Lie(w −1 PI w)
or equivalently UJ ⊂ w −1PI w. But in general one has

                       PJ∩w−1 I = (PJ ∩ w −1 PI w) · UJ

([C], Prop. 2.8.4). Thus, we deduce that the intersection PJ ∩ w −1 PI w is a
parabolic subgroup. This is only true if w = 1.
We want to recall that for any subset K ⊂ ∆ the maximal split torus in the
center
   T Z(MK ) of MK coincides with the connected component of the identity
in α∈K kern(α) ⊂ S. Since the center of MJ is contained in MJ∩w−1 I , it is
enough to construct an element z ∈ Z(MJ ) which has the desired property.
From the representation (2) we may easily conclude the existence of an ele-
ment z ∈ Z(MJ ) with γ̃w (z) 6= 1. Our purpose is to show the existence of an
element z ∈ Z(MJ ) such that γ̃w (z) − 1 ∈ R× . We may suppose that G is
adjoint. Let
                           {ωα ∈ X∗ (S); α ∈ ∆}

                                        16
be the dual base (co-fundamental weights) of ∆, i.e., hωβ , αi = δα,β , for all
α, β ∈ ∆. Since γw 6= 1 it is possible to find a root α ∈ ∆ \ J such that
wα ∈ Φ− \ Φ−I . Put
                              z := ωα (̟F−1 ).
Then we have z ∈ Z(MJ ) and

                                   γ̃w (z) − 1 = q r − 1

Q some 1 ≤ r ≤ nrα . By assumption 2 on R we know that the product
for
  r≤sup{nα ; α∈∆} (1 − q ) is invertible in R. Further we see from the expression
(3) that δMJ ∩w−1 PI w (z) = 1. This gives the proof in the first case.
2nd case: Let w = 1 and J 6⊂ I. Then we have γw = 1. Since J 6⊂ I, we see
that the restriction of δMJ ∩PI to Z(MJ∩I ) is not trivial. Again, we can find
as in the first case an element z ∈ Z(MJ∩I ) such that δMJ ∩PI (z) − 1 ∈ R× . 


Proposition 17 Let G be semi-simple and let I, J ⊂ ∆. Then we have

Proof: We apply the acyclic complex of Proposition 11 to the representation
vPGI . This yields a double complex

Proposition 15 we see that K := I ∪ J is the minimal subset of ∆ containing
I with Ext∗G (iG     G

In the case of K = ∆ we are obviously done. In the case K 6= ∆ we see
that the cohomology of the double complex vanishes, since it is a constant
coefficient system on the standard simplex corresponding to the set K. 
Proof of Theorem 1: This time we apply Proposition 11 to vPGJ . This yields

such that its associated spectral sequence converges to Ext∗G (vPGI , vPGJ ). By
Proposition 17 we conclude that the minimal subset K of ∆ containing J
and such that Ext∗G (vPGI , iG

                         K = (∆ \ I) ∪ J = (∆ \ I) ∪˙ (I ∩ J).

Thus the complex above reduces to

This double-complex is precisely - up to shifts - the double-complex for the
computation of the cohomology of vPGK , for a semi-simple group G (cf. The-
orem 12 resp. [BW] ch. X, Prop. 4.7) ! Thus, we obtain an isomorphism

            H ∗ (G, vPGK )[−(|J| − |K|) − |∆ \ I|] ∼
                                                   = Ext∗G (vPGI , vPGJ ).

It remains to compute the degree d, where the latter space does not vanish.
The degree is by Theorem 12 equal to

    d =    |∆ \ K| + |∆ \ I| + |J| − |K|
      =    |∆ \ (∆ \ I ∪˙ (I ∩ J))| + |∆ \ I| + |J| − |∆ \ I ∪˙ (I ∩ J))|
      =    |I ∩ ∆ \ (I ∩ J))| + |J| − |I ∩ J|
      =    |I \ (I ∩ J))| + |J| − |I ∩ J|
      =    |I| − |I ∩ J| + |J| − |I ∩ J|
      =    |I ∪ J| − |I ∩ J|.                                             

Remark: An argument of J.-F. Dat shows that Theorem 1 even holds if R
is not self-injective. In fact, in his paper [D] Theorem 4.4 he first shows the
statement for an algebraically closed field which is bon and banal for G. Then
he uses this result to deduce the general case by elementary commutative
algebra.
Proof of Corollary 2 : Consider the projection G → G/Z(G) onto the
adjoint group of G. The action of Z(G) on vPGI and vPGJ is trivial. By applying
Lemma 5 to this situation we get a spectral sequence

              Ext∗G/Z(G) (H∗ (Z(G), vPGI ), vPGJ ) ⇒ Ext∗G (vPGI , vPGJ ).

By the proof of Proposition 9 we deduce that

           H ∗ (Z(G), 1) = Λ∗ Hom(Z(G)/0Z(G), Z) ⊗ R ∼
                                                     = Λ∗ R d .

Therefore, we get
                                                           d
                                                           M               d
            H ∗ (Z(G), vPGI ) = H ∗ (Z(G), 1) ⊗ vPGI ∼
                                                     =            (vPGI )(j ) .
                                                            j=0


Now we apply Theorem 1 together with Corollary 7.                                 

  In the remainder of this paper we give another corollary in the case of the
general linear group and R = C. This corollary has been pointed out to me
by C. Kaiser.
  Let G = GLn with n = r · k for some integers k, r > 0. Let Pr,k be the
upper block parabolic subgroup containing the Levi subgroup

                                GLr × · · · × GLr .
                                |      {z       }
                                          k

Let σ be an irreducible cuspidal representation of GLr . For any integer i ≥ 0
we put σ(i) = σ⊗| det |i , where det : GLr → F × is the determinant. Consider
the graph Γ consisting of the vertices {σ, σ(1), . . . , σ(k − 1)} and the edges
{{σ(i), σ(i + 1)}; i = 0, . . . , k − 2}. Thus we can illustrate Γ in the shape

                           σ − σ(1) − · · · − σ(k − 1).

An orientation of Γ is given by choosing a direction on each edge. Denote by
Or(Γ) the set of orientations on Γ.


                                          19
   Let J be the set of irreducible subquotients of ĩG
                                                     Pr,k (σ⊗σ(1)⊗· · ·⊗σ(k−1)),
        G
where ĩPr,k denotes the normalized induction functor. Following [Z] 2.2, there
is a bijection
                                ω : Or(Γ) → J ,
which we briefly describe. Let Sk be the symmetric group in the set {0, . . . , k − 1}.
Consider the map
                                 Sk → Or(Γ)
                                    w 7→ Γ(w)
defined as follows. The edge {σ(i), σ(i + 1)} is oriented from σ(i) to σ(i + 1)
- symbolized as σ(i) → σ(i + 1) - if and only if w(i) < w(i + 1). On easily
verifies the surjectivity of this map. Let ~Γ be an orientation of Γ. Choose an
element w ∈ Sk such that ~Γ = Γ(w). Then ω(~Γ) is defined to be the unique
irreducible quotient of
                       ĩG
                         Pr,k (σ(w(0)) ⊗ · · · ⊗ σ(w(k − 1))).

In loc.cit. 2.7 it is shown that this representation does not depend on the
chosen representative w.
   Denote by ∆k = {α0 , . . . , αk−2} the set of simple roots of GLk with respect
to the standard root system of GLk . Let P(∆k ) be its power set. For a
subset I ⊂ ∆k , we let Θ(I) ∈ Or(Γ) be the orientation of Γ defined by
σ(i) → σ(i + 1) if and only if αi ∈ I, i = 0, . . . , k − 2. It is easily seen that
we get in this way a bijection
                              Θ : P(∆k ) → Or(Γ).
For any subset I ⊂ ∆k , we put
                                vIG (σ) := ω(Θ(I)).

                                                                 1−n
Example: Consider the special case r = 1 and σ = | |              2    . Then we have
Pr,k = P,
                    ĩG                           G
                      P (σ ⊗ · · · ⊗ σ(n − 1)) = iP

and
                                   vIG (σ) = vPGI ,
for all I ⊂ ∆ = ∆k .

Corollary 18 Let I, J ⊂ ∆k . Set i := |I ∪ J| − |I ∩ J|. Then we have
                  Ext∗G (vIG (σ), vJG (σ)) = R[−i] ⊕ R[−i − 1].

Proof: We make use of the theory of types of Bushnell and Kutzko [BK] (see
also [V2]). Let (K, λ) be the type of the block containing v∅G (σ). By definition
K is a compact open subgroup of G and λ is an irreducible representation of
K, such that the functor

                          V 7→ HomG (c − iG
                                          K (λ), V )

is an equivalence of categories from the block above to the category of right
                                                                   ′
EndG (iGK (λ))-modules. There exists an unramified extension F /F , such
that the following holds ([BK],[V2]). Set G = GLk (F ) and let I ′ ⊂ G′ be
                                              ′           ′

the standard Iwahori subgroup. Then there is an algebra isomorphism [BK]
7.6.19
                       EndG′ (iG                  G
                                I ′ (1)) → EndG (iK (λ)).

This isomorphism induces an equivalence between the block of unipotent
G′ -representations and the block of G-representations containing v∅G (σ). Un-
der this equivalence, the representations vIG (σ) and vPGI correspond to each
other. This can be seen from the fact that the equivalence is compatible
with normalized induction [BK] 7.6.21 and with twists [BK] 7.5.12. Thus,
the statement follows from Corollary 2.                                     
