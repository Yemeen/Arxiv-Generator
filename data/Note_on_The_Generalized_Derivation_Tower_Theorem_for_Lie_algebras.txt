Introduction

A Lie algebra g over a field K of characteristic 0, is called complete if the center
of g is trivial and all derivations of g are inner. Let (gn ) be the series of alge-
bras defined by g0 = g and gn+1 = Der gn , it is called the tower of derivation
algebras of g. E. Schenkman proved that the derivation tower theorem which
asserts that if the center of g is trivial, then the derivation tower of g terminates
with a complete Lie algebras b   g, [4]. In this note we revisite this theorem aiming
to provide an explicite construction of the limit Lie algebra b     g. The method is
based on Γ-decomposition in terms of so-called Γ-triples which are essentially
unique, cf Theorem 1. 2. This allows to characterize completeness of g in terms
of the representation µ associated to a Γ-triple, cf Theorem 2. 3. Both theorems
cited providece us with a technique of decomposing Lie algebras that allows to
construct the limit bg when it exists: In Section 2 we carry out this explicite con-
struction under the assomption that the center of gn is trivial, i.e. the center of
Der (gn+1 ) is zero. The form of b    g given in (2.11) follows from the main result
Theorem 3 concerning Lie algebras with trivial center.
In Section 3 the general case is considered allowing the bad case when the se-
quence of the dimension increases divergently. The remaining cases are classified
in two classes, the first case dealt with by Theorem 3 and a second class allowing
to discribe bg as K × [bg, b
                           g], the latter being a perfect complete Lie algebra. So,
excluding the bad case we obtain concrete structure results for the limit Lie
algebra bg, cf Theorem 4.



1     Γ-Decomposition

Throughout this paper, g is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field K of
characteristic 0, Z (g) its center, r its radical, n its largest nilpotent ideal, C ∞ (g)
is the intersection of the ideals C p (g) of the central descending sequence of g
and Der g its Lie algebra of derivations. The Lie algebra Der g is then algebraic
[1, p. 179]. The Lie algebra ad g is an ideal of Der g. Let e (ad g) be the smallest
Lie algebra which is algebraic in g and contains ad g [1, p. 173]. Then we have

                               ad g ⊂ e (ad g) ⊂ Der g.                            (1.1)

A Lie subalgebra Γ of gl (g) is said to be completely reducible or c.r. if its natural
action on g is semi-simple. This means that this Lie algebra is reductive and
its center consists of linear maps which are all semi-simple. A Lie subalgebra of
gl (g) is said to be maximal completely reducible or m.c.r. if it is maximal among
the c.r. Lie subalgebras. Two m.c.r. Lie subalgebras of gl (g) are isomorphic
[3]. Let u ∈ gl (g) and let u = u |S +u |N be its Jordan decomposition with u |S
(u |N resp. ) its semi-simple (nilpotent resp.) component. If u ⊂ gl (g) is a
subspace, we will denote by u |S (u |N resp.) the set of semi-simple (nilpotent
resp.) components of the Jordan decomposition.

Lemma 1 Let g be a Lie algebra over K and Γ be a c.r Lie subalgebra of Der g.
Then g satisfies

                              
  1. g = gΓ ⊕ Γ · g, gΓ , Γ · g ⊂ Γ · g, where gΓ := {x ∈ g : α · x = 0, ∀α ∈ Γ} ,
     Γ · g := {α · g, ∀α ∈ Γ},
  2. If we set p := Γ · g + [Γ · g, Γ · g], then p is an ideal of g generated by Γ · g
     such that C p (g) = p + C p gΓ ∀p ∈ N ∪ {∞},
  3. There exists a Levi subalgebra s of g such that Γ · s ⊂ s,
                            −1
  4. If we set a := (ad g )      (ad g ∩ Γ) then a is a reductive Lie subalgebra of g
     satisfying Γ · a ⊂ a.

Proof. The natural action of Γ on g being semi-simple, we then have g = gΓ ⊕ Γ · g.
For all x ∈ gΓ , y ∈ g and α ∈ Γ ⊂ Der g then

                      α · [x, y] = [α · x, y] + [x, α · y] = [x, α · y]           (1.2)

and                                h          i
                                    gΓ , Γ · g ⊂ Γ · g.                          (1.3)
                                 Γ       
The statement 1. holds. Since g , Γ · g ⊂ Γ · g we deduce that p is an ideal of g and
generated by Γ · g. The rest of the statement 2. is obvious. Γ being reductive, there
exists a Levi subalgebra s of g such that

                       Γ := ad s ⊕ Z (Γ)      and     [Γ, Γ] = ad s.              (1.4)

Since Γ is not maximal then there exists a m.c.r subalgebra Γmax of Der g containing
Γ such that Γmax · s ⊂ s and a fortiori Γ · s ⊂ s.                                


Lemma 2 Let g be a Lie algebra over K. Then there exists a nilpotent Lie
subalgebra h of g such that g = h + C ∞ gΓ .

Proof. This is obvious if dim g = 0. We reason by induction on n := dim g. We
may assume that g is not nilpotent else we set g := h. There exists x ∈ g such that
δ := ad x |S is different from zero and g = δ · g ⊕ gδ . We have dim gδ < n and
                
gδ = h + C ∞ gδ by the induction hypothesis. The inclusion δ · g ⊂ C ∞ (g) yields
                                   
δ (g) ⊂ C ∞ gΓ and g = h + C ∞ gΓ .                                              


Corollary 1 Let g be a Lie algebra over K. There exists a Levi subalgebra s of
g and a nilpotent Lie subalgebra h of r such that

  1. g = s + h + n and [s, h] = 0,
  2. e (ad g) = Γ ⊕ ∆ with Γ := ad s + ad h |S , ∆ := ad h |N +ad n and Γ · h = 0.
     We will say that Γ is a m.c.r Lie subalgebra of e (ad g) associated to (s, h).




                                             3
Proof. By Lemma 2 there exists a nilpotent Lie subalgebra h of r such that
                                 
             rad s = h + C ∞ rad s ⊂ h + n and r = rad s ⊕ [s, r] .                          (1.5)

We have [s, r] ⊂ n, hence g = s + h + n and [s, h] = 0 and h is nilpotent. It follows that

           ad g = ad s + ad h + ad n     and    e (ad g) = ad s + e (ad h) + ad n.           (1.6)
The Lie algebra e (ad h) is nilpotent and admits a Chevalley decomposition

                                  ad h |N ⊕ad h |S ,       [1].                              (1.7)

It follows that
                            e (ad g) = Γ ⊕ ∆        and      Γ·h=0                           (1.8)
with
                    Γ := ad s + ad h |S    and        ∆ := ad h |N +ad n.                    (1.9)
Hence Γ is maximal by construction.                                                             

   We introduce the notion of a Γ-decomposition in iv) hereafter.


Theorem 1 Let g be a Lie algebra over K and r its radical.

   1. There is a bijection of the set of c.r.m subalgebras of e (ad g) into the set
      of sequences of vector spaces (s, k, m) of g such that :
   i) s is a Levi subalgebra of g,
  ii) k is an ideal nilpotent of g such that [s, k] = 0,
 iii) m is a subspace of r such that r = m ⊕ k and [s ⊕ k, m] = m, and
  iv) g = s ⊕ k ⊕ m. Will call (s, k, m) a Γ-triple and s ⊕ k ⊕ m a Γ-decomposition
      of g.
   2. Let (si , ki , mi ) be two Γi -triple of g with i = 1, 2, then there exists an inner
      automorphism γ of g such that

         Γ2 = γ ◦ Γ1 ◦ γ −1 ,    s2 = γ (s1 ) ,        m2 = γ (m1 ) ,      k2 = γ (k1 ) .   (1.10)

Proof. If we assume that there exists a such decomposition g = s⊕k⊕m, we construct
Γ by setting
                                 Γ := ad s ⊕ ad k |S                        (1.11)
i.e. Corollary 1.2. Conversely, let Γ be a m.c.r Lie subalgebra of e (ad g), we set

                  k := gΓ   m := Γ · r    and       s := (ad g )−1 (ad g ∩ Γ) .             (1.12)

It is obvious that s is a Levi subalgebra of g. We have

                            Γ·g =Γ·m⊕Γ·k⊕Γ·s = m⊕s                                          (1.13)

since
                        Γ · m = m,       Γ·s=s         and    Γ · k = 0.                    (1.14)
By Lemma 1, we have
                                g = gΓ ⊕ Γ · g = s ⊕ k ⊕ m.                                 (1.15)


                                                4
Since
                                     [Γ, ad k] = ad (Γ · k) = 0                            (1.16)
it follows that
                                  [Γ, ad k |S ] = [Γ, ad k |N ] = 0.                       (1.17)
Hence
                                        ad k |S ⊂ Z (Γ) ⊂ Γ                                (1.18)
because Γ is m.c.r Lie subalgebra. The Lie algebra

                                  Z (Γ) + ad k = Z (Γ) ⊕ ad k |N                           (1.19)

is thus nilpotent. Then ad k is nilpotent and we conclude that k is nilpotent. We have
[s ⊕ k, m] ⊂ m since m ⊂ r. If [s ⊕ k, m] 6= m then

                            (ad s + e(ad k))m 6= m     and    Γ · m 6= m.                  (1.20)

This is a contradiction. The statement 2. is a consequence of G. D. Mostow’s theorem
[3] applied to e (ad g).                                                          


Corollary 2 Let (s, k, m) be a Γ-triple of g with Γ a c.r.m Lie subalgebra e (ad g).
Then
                                                         Γ
                        Der g = ad s ⊕ ad m ⊕ (Der g)
                  Γ
where (Der g) is the centralizer of Γ in Der g.

Proof. The adjoint representation of Γ in Der g being semi-simple, then

                                  Der g = [Der g, Γ] ⊕ (Der g)Γ .                          (1.21)

Since
                               [Γ, Der g] ⊂ [e (ad g) , Der g] ⊂ ad g                      (1.22)
and
                                      (Der g)Γ ∩ ad g = ad k                               (1.23)
hence
                                Der g = ad s ⊕ ad m ⊕ (Der g)Γ .                           (1.24)
                                                                                               


Remark 1 The vector space m is not a subalgebra of g in general. If we consider
the solvable Lie algebra generated by {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 } with its multiplication
defined by

        [x1 , x2 ] = x5 ,   [x1 , x3 ] = x3 ,   [x1 , x4 ] = −x4 ,     [x3 , x4 ] = x5 .   (1.25)

Then

  Γ = K · ad x1 |S ,        k = K · x1 + K · x2 + K · x5 ,        m = K · x3 + K · x4 . (1.26)

We observe that m is not an ideal.

Proposition 1 Let (si , ki , mi ) be a Γi -triple of the Lie algebra gi with each Γi a
c.r.m Lie subalgebras of e (ad gi ) with i = 1, 2. Then (s1 × s2 , k1 × k2 , m1 × m2 )
is a Γ1 × Γ2 -triple of the Lie algebra g1 × g2 .


                                                  5
Proposition 2 Let f : g → g′ be an Lie algebra epimorphism and Γ a c.r.m
subalgebra of e (ad g). Then

   1. The subalgebra Γ′ induced by Γ on the quotient g′ satisfying Γ′ ◦ f = f ◦ Γ
      is a c.r.m subalgebra of e (ad g′ ).
   2. If (s, k, m) is a Γ-triple of g with Γ a c.r.m Lie subalgebra of e (ad g), then
      (f (s) , f (k) , f (m)) is a Γ′ -triple of g′ .

Proof. It is easy to check that the property 1. We have

                                    g′ = f (s) ⊕ f (k) ⊕ f (m)                            (1.27)

where f (k) ⊕ f (m) is the radical of g′ . Since

                                 [f (s) ⊕ f (m) , f (m)] = f (m) ,                        (1.28)

then (f (s) , f (k) , f (m)) is a Γ′ -triple of g′ .                                           



Lemma 3 Let (s, k, m) be a Γ-triple of g with Γ a c.r.m Lie subalgebra of
e (ad g). The inclusion [k, m] ⊂ m defines a representation

                               µ : k → gl (m) ,        x 7→ ad x |m .

We then have :

   1. Z (g) = Z (k) ∩ ker µ.
   2. µ is injective if and only if Z (g) = 0.
   3. The Lie subalgebra n̂ of g generated by m is a nilpotent ideal of g such that

            n̂ = C ∞ (g) ∩ n = m + [m, m] ,            C p (g) = s + C p (k) + n̂,   ∀p ∈ N.

Proof. Let x ∈ Z (k) ∩ ker µ then


                                    [s ⊕ k ⊕ m, x] = [k, x] = 0                           (1.29)
and x ∈ Z (g). Conversely, if x ∈ Z (g) we have [g, x] = {0}, hence

                                   Γ·x⊂k        and     Γ2 · x = 0.                       (1.30)

This means that x ∈ k so x ∈ Z (k) ∩ ker µ. Hence statement 1 holds. The assump-
tion that µ is not injective is equivalent to

                                    Z (g) = Z (k) ∩ ker µ 6= 0                            (1.31)

since every non-null nilpotent ideal intersects the center. Hence statement 2 holds.
Using Lemma 1.2 and the Γ-decomposition of g, we deduce statement 3.              

Lemma 4 Let V be a vector space over K. Let b,a be two Lie subalgebras of
gl (V) such that a ⊂ b. Let Φ be a map of V2 into g := a ⊕ V. We define a
bracket [, ] on g by

with x, y ∈ a, v1 , v2 ∈ V. If this bracket defines a Lie structure on g, then it can
be lifted to g′ := b ⊕ V by setting :

                      [x, Φ(v1 , v2 )] = Φ (x · v1 , v2 ) + Φ (v, x · v2 )

for all (x, v1 , v2 ) ∈ b × V2 .

   Let (s, k, m) be a Γ-triple of g with Γ a m.c.r Lie subalgebra e (ad g). Let
δ ∈ (Der g)Γ . Then it is easy to check that

                                   δ (m) = m,       δ (k) = k                           (1.32)

and
                                            δ (s) = 0.                                  (1.33)
This means that δ defines a linear map
                                        Γ
                           Θ : (Der g) → gl (m)          δ 7→ δ |m .                    (1.34)
                                   Γ
The set of derivations (Der n̂) of n̂ which commute with the restriction Γ |n̂ of
Γ to n̂, stabilizes k ∩ n̂ and m. There exists an isomorphism of Lie algebras of
        Γ              Γ                                                Γ
(Der n̂) into (Der n̂) |m . The image of Θ is contained in B := (Der n̂) |m .

    Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, entail the following:

Theorem 2 Let (s, k, m) be a Γ-triple of g with Γ a c.r.m subalgebra of e (ad g).
Let µ : k → gl (m) be the representation defined by µ (x) = ad x |m . Assume µ
is injective, then:

                                                                       Γ
   1. The map Θ defines an isomorphism of Der (g)                          into the normalizer
      NB (µ (k)) of µ (k) in B.
   2. We may identify the Lie algebra Der g with the Lie algebra s⊕NB (µ (k))⊕m
      with its law Φ defined from the bracket [, ] of g in the following way, for
      all (x1 , y1 , z1 ) , (x2 , y2 , z2 ) ∈ s × NB (µ (k)) × m:

                             Φ (x1 , x2 + y2 + z2 ) = [x1 , x2 ] + [x1 , z2 ]
                             Φ (y1 , y2 + z2 ) = y1 · y2 − y2 · y1 + y1 · z2
                             Φ (z1 , z2 ) = µ(k) + m

      with k and m the projections of [z1 , z2 ] into k and m, respectively.
   3. In particular g is complete if and only if µ (k) is equal to its normalizer in
      B.

                                                7
Proof. Let δ ∈ (Der g)Γ such that Θ(δ) = 0, hence:

     0 = δ ([x, y]) = [δ (x) , y] + [x, δ (y)] = µ(δ (x)) · y         ∀   (x, y) ∈ k × m.   (1.35)

It follows that
                         δ (x) ∈ ker µ = 0,     and       δ (g) = δ (k) = 0.                (1.36)
Then injectivity of Θ follows. Let δ1 be an element of NB (µ(k)). For all x1 ∈ k, there
exits x2 = µ−1 ([δ1 , µ (x1 )]) since µ is injective. It follows that

                                      [δ1 , µ(x1 )] = µ (x2 ) ,                             (1.37)

so we may define a derivation δ2 of k by δ2 (x1 ) = x2 .
The surjectivity derives from the linear application δ defined by

                                δ |s = 0,   δ |k = δ2 ,      δ |m = δ1                      (1.38)

which belongs to (Der g)Γ . Let δ3 be the derivation of n̂ which extends δ. Then δ3 is
equal to δ2 on k ∩ n̂. Indeed for x ∈ k ∩ n̂ we have

                                  [δ3 , ad n̂ (x)] = ad n̂ (δ3 (x))                         (1.39)

and by restriction to m this yieldss

                                      [δ1 , µ(x)] = µ(δ3 (x))                               (1.40)

which is also equal to µ(δ2 (x)) by definition of δ2 . Then δ3 (x) = δ2 (x) because of the
injectivity of µ.
It follows that δ1 ∈ (Der g)Γ since the equality

                   δ1 ([x, y]) = [δ2 (x), y] + [x, δ1 (y)]     ∀   (x, y) ∈ k × m           (1.41)

is equivalent to
                                     [δ1 , µ (x)] = µ(δ2 (x)).                              (1.42)
Thus statement 1 holds. By Corollary 2, Lemma 4 and statement 1, we arrive at
statement 2. The statement 3 follows from statements 1 and 2.              

   Theorem 2 allows to identify the Lie algebra g with the Lie subalgebra
s ⊕ µ(k) ⊕ m of s ⊕ NB (µ(k)) ⊕ m via the isomorphism defined by

              s + k + m 7→ s + µ(k) + m ∀                  (s, k, m) ∈ s × k × m.           (1.43)

We define a Lie algebra s ⊕ B ⊕ m with the same law Φ by taking y1 and y2
in B instead of NB (µ(k)). We verify that this is really a Lie algebra by using
Lemma 4. If g is identified with s ⊕ µ(k) ⊕ m, we have the Lie algebra inclusions:

                           g ⊂ s ⊕ NB (µ(k)) ⊕ m ⊂ s ⊕ B ⊕ m                                (1.44)



Corollary 3 Let (s, k, m) be a Γ-triple of g with Γ a c.r.m subalgebra of e (ad g).
The Lie algebra g′ = s ⊕ B ⊕ m is complete.

Proof. The triple (s, B, m) of g′ is a Γ′ -triple with Γ′ obtained by the extension of Γ
to g′ which is trivial on B. Using Theorem 2.3 for the natural representation µ of B
in m, we deduce that s ⊕ B ⊕ m is complete.                                            

2     Derivation tower of Lie algebras: case with
      trivial center

We recall that the derivation tower of a Lie algebra g is the sequence of Lie
algebras (gn )n∈N such that
                         g0 = g,     and gn+1 = Der (gn ) .                     (2.1)
If the center of gn is trivial, hence the center of Der (gn+1 ) is zero. Then we
can identify gn with ad gn , and we have a sequence of ideals:
                          gn ⊳ gn+1 ⊳ . . . ⊳ gn+k ⊳ . . . .                    (2.2)
In this case, Schenkman proved that this sequence has a limit b
                                                              g, [4]. If A is a
Lie subalgebra of a Lie algebra B, we consider the sequence of normalizers in
B:
                      Np+1           p
                        B A = NB (NB A),    N0B A = A.                    (2.3)
The following sequence of ideals
                   A ⊳ . . . ⊳ NpB A ⊳ Np+1            ∞
                                        B A ⊳ . . . ⊳ NB A ⊂ B                  (2.4)

terminates for an integer p since the dimension is finite, say Nq+1      q
                                                                B A = NB A and
                  q
the Lie algebra NB A denoted N∞   B A will be equal to its normalizer in B. With
this notation we state:

Theorem 3 Let s ⊕ k ⊕ m be a Γ-decomposition of a Lie algebra g with trivial
center and Γ being a m.c.r. Lie subalgebra of e(ad g). The sequence of normal-
izers
                                                               cB (µ(k))
              µ(k) ⊳ N1B (µ(k)) ⊳ . . . ⊳ NnB (µ(k)) ⊳ . . . ⊳ N
contained in B = (Der n)Γ | m terminates at N    d              q
                                                   B (µ(k)) = NB (µ(k)) for some
                        q+1            q
integer q such that NB (µ(k)) = NB (µ(k)). The derivation tower of a Lie
algebra g is given by the Lie subalgebras gn = s ⊕ NnB (µ(k)) ⊕ m of s ⊕ k ⊕ m and
terminates at bg := s ⊕ NdB (µ(k)) ⊕ m, thus b
                                             g is complete.

Proof. For dim g = 0, g always admits a decomposition s ⊕ k ⊕ m associated with Γ,
cf. Theorem 1. We reason by induction on n := dim g. Let us assume that for an
integer n ≥ 0 we have
                             g n = s ⊕ Nn
                                        B (µ (k)) ⊕ m                        (2.5)
associated with the m.c.r. algebra Γn obtained by the extension of Γ to gn which is
trivial on Nn
            B (µ(k)) using the inclusion given by (1). The Lie algebra Γn satisfies

                                        Γn · r = m                               (2.6)
and µn is injective since it is given by the natural representation of B in m. Because
of Theorem 2, it is possible to identify gn+1 with
                                   s ⊕ Nn+1
                                        B   (µ(k)) ⊕ m.                          (2.7)
The Lie algebra Γn acts by the adjoint representation on gn+1 which is equivalent to
the extension of Γn to gn+1 trivial on Nn+1
                                        B (µ(k)). We then set

                                     Γn+1 := ad Γn                               (2.8)


                                            9
and we have
                                Γn+1 | g = Γn | g = Γ.                         (2.9)
The rest of the proof is obvious.                                                 
We then have
                          d
                          N            b
                           B (µ(k)) = (N(Der n)Γ (ad k)) |m                  (2.10)
and the Lie algebra b
                    g is also given by

                          b        b (Der n)Γ (ad k)) |m ⊕m
                          g = s ⊕ (N                                         (2.11)



Example 1 Let a be a nilpotent Lie subalgebra of gl(V) such that a · V = V.
Let g = a ⊕ V be a semi-direct product for the natural representation of a by the
abelian Lie algebra V. This decomposition is associated to Γ with

                            k = a,    m = V,      Γ = ad A                   (2.12)

where A is the set of semi-simple components of elements of a. With notation
as in Theorem 3, B is the centralizer of A in gl(V) and we have

                                    b d
                                    g=NB (a) ⊕ V.                            (2.13)


Corollary 4 We redecover the majoration given in [4]:

         g ≤ dim(s ⊕ B ⊕ m) ≤ dim Der (C ∞ (g)) + dim Z (C ∞ (g)) .
     dim b                                                                   (2.14)

Proof. Let g = s ⊕ k ⊕ m be the decomposition of g associated with Γ with

                                     C ∞ (g) = s ⊕ n                          (2.15)

cf. Corollary 2. 2. The Lie subalgebra

                           ad (C ∞ (g)) + (Der (C ∞ (g)))Γ                    (2.16)
                                         Γ
of Der (C ∞ (g)) where (Der (C ∞ (g))) is the centralizer of the restriction of Γ to
C ∞ (g) in Der (C ∞ (g)), can be written as

                           ad s ⊕ (Der (C ∞ (g)))Γ ⊕ ad m.                    (2.17)

The isomorphisms

                      (Der (C ∞ (g)))Γ ∼
                                       = (Der n̂) ∼

show that its dimension is always greater than

                    dim s + dim(Der n̂)Γ + dim m + dim Z(C ∞ (g))             (2.19)

which is equal to
                          dim(s ⊕ B ⊕ m) − dim Z(C ∞ (g))                     (2.20)
and the result follows.                                                           

    The case where the sequence terminates at the first degree is descibed in the
following.

                                             10
Proposition 3 If g is a Lie algebra with trivial center, then Der g is complete
if and only if the ideal ad g of Der g is characteristic.

Proof. The necessity is trivial. Now if ad g is a characteristic ideal of Der g, it is
stable under Der (Der g) denoted by Der 2 (g). The image of the restriction morphism
ρ of Der 2 (g) to ad g is equal to

                               Der (ad g) ∼
                                          = ad (Der g) .                         (2.21)

The kernel J of ρ has zero intersection with ad (Der g) and Der 2 (g) is the direct sum
of the ideal J and ad (Der g). We have

                         [ad (Der g) , J] = −ad (J · Der g)] = 0                 (2.22)

and J · Der g is zero since the center of Der g is zero, so J = 0. Thus

                                Der 2 (g) = ad (Der g) .                         (2.23)

                                                                                    


Corollary 5 If Z (g) = 0 and [g, g] = g then Der g is complete.



3     The Derivation tower of Lie algebras: general
      case

Let (gn )n∈N be the derivation tower of a Lie algebra g. We now consider the
general case. The ideal I of Der g of derivations which commute with ad g is the
set of derivations of images contained in Z (g). Hence I vanishes on [g, g] and
contains the center of Der g. If Z (g) or [g, g] = g then I = 0. If g is the direct
product g1 × g2 , we denote Iij where i is different to j, for the set of derivations
vanishing on [gi , gi ] × gj and their images contained in Z (g).

Lemma 5 We set

                   Der gk = {f ∈ Der (g1 × g2 ) : f | 0 × gk = 0}                (3.1)

for k = 1, 2. Then

                    Der (g1 × g2 ) = Der g1 ⊕ Der g2 ⊕ I12 ⊕ I21 .               (3.2)


Proof. We decompose each derivation into four linear maps gi → gj for i, j ∈ {1, 2}
by expressing the derivation property.                                          


Lemma 6 The sequence (gn ) defined by a Lie algebra g = K × a such that
                                                                 g, b
dim (Der g) = dim g belongs to case 1 or 2 of Theorem 4 for a = [b  g].




                                           11
Proof. Lemma 5 shows that

                             Der g = Kǫ ⊕ Der a ⊕ I12 ⊕ I21                           (3.3)

where ǫ is the identity on K and 0 on a. So

        dim (Der g) = dim g = 1 + dim (Der a) + dim Z (a) + dim (a/ [a, a]) .         (3.4)

We necessarily have
                             [a, a] = a   andDer a = ad a.                    (3.5)
                                                    ∼
If Z (a) = 0 then a is perfect, complete and Der g = K × a: the sequence terminates
at K × a, case 2.
If Z (a) 6= 0 then we have
                                   Der g ∼
                                         = ad a ⊕ I                           (3.6)
(the center of ad a is trivial when [a, a] = a) with I = Kǫ ⊕ I12 .
We have [ǫ, f ] = −f for all f ∈ I12 such that the center of Der g is zero and the
sequence belongs to case 1.                                                     


Proposition 4 Let a be a characteristic ideal of codimension 1 of g. Then

   1. dim (Der g) − dim (g) = dim (Der g |a ) − dim (ad g |a ).
   2. If dim (Der g) = dim (g), then
   i) Der g |b = ad g |b for any ideal b contained in a,
  ii) g is algebraic,
 iii) any ideal of codimension 1 of g is characteristic.

Proof. Let δ be a derivation of g vanishing on a, then it vanishes on [g, g] and
[δ · g, a] = 0. If a is not a direct factor of g δ · g ⊂ Z (a). We check that all morphisms
of g vanishing on a and with image contained in Z (a) are derivations of g. Hence we
have:
                          dim (Der g |a ) = dim (Der g) − dim (Z (a))                  (3.7)
since
                          dim (g) = dim (adg |a ) + dim (Z (a))                       (3.8)
from (3.7) and (3.8) the statement follows. If the ideal a is direct factor of g then it is
perfect since a is characteristic and we directly verify the equality 1.
If dim Der g = dim g then
                                    Der g |b = ad g |b                               (3.9)
by 1. If the radical of g is not nilpotent then

                                     Der g = ad g + J                                (3.10)

where J is the ideal of derivations vanishing on b = [g, g] + n and we have J2 = 0.
Hence
                                    Der g = Γ ⊕ N                             (3.11)
where Γ is a m.c.r Lie subalgebra of e (ad g) and

                                      N := J + adn                                   (3.12)



                                            12
is the largest nilpotent Lie subalgebra. We may check that

                                     Z (g) = Z (n)Γ .                              (3.13)

Let I be the ideal of morphisms of g which vanish on b and having their images
contained in Z (g). Then
                                  I ∩ ad g = 0                           (3.14)
indeed, if x ∈ g such that
                                      [x, g] ⊂ Z (g)                               (3.15)
then Γ · x = 0 and if [x, b] = 0 then x ∈ Z (g). Hence

                 dim (ad g + I) = dim (g) + (codim (b) − 1) · dim (Z (g))          (3.16)

If codim (b) > 1 then the center of g is trivial and g is complete. Hence it is algebraic.
If codim (b) = 1 then
                                   g = s + K · x + n.                               (3.17)
By (3.7), then
                                    Der g = ad g ⊕ I                               (3.18)
and there exists an element y ∈ g such that ad y | a is the semi-simple component of
ad x | a. The decomposition s ⊕ K · ad y ⊕ n of g satisfies the following property

                               [s ⊕ K · ad y, K · ad y] = 0.                       (3.19)

The torus K · ad y is maximal in the centralizer of ad s in Der g which is algebraic.
Hence g is algebraic, cf. [1].                                                    


Corollary 6 If dim (Der g) = dim (g) then the condition Z (g) 6= 0 means that
the codimension of [g, g] in g is 1 or 0.


Theorem 4 Let (gn )n∈N be the derivation tower of a Lie algebra g. Then it
belongs to one of the following distinct cases:

   1. Z (gn ) = 0 for n sufficiently large and the sequence terminates at a com-
      plete Lie algebra given by Theorem 3.
   2. Z (gn ) 6= 0 for all n and the sequence terminates at a Lie algebra b   g equal
      to K × [b g, b         g, b
                   g] where [b  g] is a perfect (i.e. equal to its derived ideal) and
      complete Lie algebra.
   3. The sequence of dimensions of gn increases and diverges.

Proof. First let us assume that if (gn ) does not satisfy 1., i.e. if Z (gn ) 6= 0 for
all n, then the sequence of dimensions dim gn increases in the large sense. If there
would exist an integer n such that dim (Der g) < dim gn then gn should be perfect,
cf. [2], and the center of Der gn should be zero since I = 0, a contradiction. Let us
assume that (gn ) does not satisfy 3., it just remains to study the sequences gn such
that Z (gn ) 6= 0, with dim gn = dim gp for all n ≥ p and we set g = gp . From Corollary
6, a Lie algebra satisfying

                      dim (Der g) = dim g,    Z (g) 6= 0,      [g, g] 6= g         (3.20)



                                             13
admits an ideal a of codimension one equal to [g, g]. We may assume that [g, g] 6= g
since a sequence associated with [g, g] = g belongs to case 1.
If Z (g) is not included in a, then we have
                                         g∼
                                          = K×a                                      (3.21)

and we may conclude in view of Lemma 6. Suppose now that Z(g) ⊂ a. By Proposition
4.2. we derive
                                 Der g |a = ad g |a                        (3.22)
thus we may write:
                                     Der g = ad g + J                                (3.23)
where J is the ideal of derivations vanishing on a.
If g = Kx ⊕ a for x ∈
                    / a, J is the set of morphisms δ of g such that
                             δ (a) = 0   and     δ (x) ∈ Zg (a)                      (3.24)

the centralizer of a in g. We have Zg (a) ⊂ a because
                            Z (g) ⊂ a,   [Der g, Der g] = ad g a                     (3.25)

since J2 = 0 and J · g ⊂ a. If Der g has non-zero center, its derived ideal is also codi-
mension 1 and the dimension of ad g (a) is the same as a, so Z (g) = 0, a contradiction.



Corollary 7 If the sequence (gn ) has an element gp with non-nilpotent radical,
then all gn , n ≥ p, have this property and the sequence is of type 1 or 2. The
sequence of dimensions of type 3 increases strictly from gp on.

Proof. We will show that the sequence (gn ) associated with g, with r (g) 6= n (g),
Z (g) 6= 0 and dim Der g = dim g is of type 1. The algebraic Lie algebra g has a
decomposition s ⊕ u ⊕ n such that [s ⊕ u, u] = 0 and the ideal [g, g] = s ⊕ n is of
codimension 1, by proof of theorem 4. The ideal C2 g of x ∈ g such that [x, g] ⊂ Z (g)
is equal to Z (g) because we have [x, s ⊕ n] = 0 and that [x, u] ⊂ Z (g) means [x, u] = 0,
u consisting of semi-simple elements. So we have ad g ∩ I = ad (C2 g) = 0 and Der g is
a direct product of the ideal ad g with its center is trivial by the ideal I which satisfies
I2 = 0. We conclude by using Lemma 5 showing that the center of Der (Der g) is
trivial.                                                                                  
