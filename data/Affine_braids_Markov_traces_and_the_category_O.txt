                                             1. Introduction
                                                  This paper provides a unified approach to results on representations of affine Hecke alge-
                                             bras, cyclotomic Hecke algebras, affine BMW algebras, cyclotomic BMW algebras, Markov traces,
                                             Jacobi-Trudi type identities, dual pairs [Ze], and link invariants [Tu2]. The key observation in the
                                             genesis of this paper was that the technical tools used to obtain the results in Orellana [Or] and
                                             Suzuki [Su], two a priori unrelated papers, are really the same. Here we develop this method and
                                             explain how to apply it to obtain results similar to those in [Or] and [Su] in more general settings.
                                             Some specific new results which are obtained are the following:
                                                  (a) A generalization of the results on Markov traces obtained by Orellana [Or] to centralizer
                                                       algebras coming from quantum groups of all Lie types.
                                                  (b) A generalization of the results of Suzuki [Su] to show that Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials
                                                       of all finite Weyl groups occur as decomposition numbers in the representation theory of
                                                       affine braid groups of type A,
                                                  (c) A generalization of the functors used by Zelevinsky [Ze] to representations of affine braid
                                                       groups of type A,
                                                  (d) We define the affine BMW algebra (Birman-Murakami-Wenzl) and show that it has a
                                                       representation theory analogous to that of affine Hecke algebras. In particular there are
                                                       “standard modules” for these algebras which have composition series where multiplicites
                                                       of the factors are given by Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for Weyl groups of types A,B,and
                                                       C.
                                                  (e) We generalize the results of Leduc and Ram [LR] to affine centralizer algebras.
                                                  Let Uh g be the Drinfel’d-Jimbo quantum group associated to a finite dimensional complex
                                             semisimple Lie algebra g. If M is a (possibly infinite dimensional) Uh g-module in the category O

and V is a finite dimensional Uh g-module then we show that the affine braid group B̃k acts on the
Uh g-module M ⊗ V ⊗k . Fix V and define
                                                                                 
                                     the vector space of highest weight vectors
                     Fλ (M ) =                                                        .
                                             of weight λ in M ⊗ V ⊗k .

Then Fλ is a functor from Uh g modules in category O to finite dimensional modules for the affine
braid group B̃k which takes
     (1) finite dimensional Uh g modules to “calibrated” B̃k modules,
     (2) Verma modules to “standard” modules, and
     (3) under appropriate conditions, irreducible Uh g modules to irreducible B̃k modules.
Applying the functor Fλ to a Jantzen filtration of Verma modules of Uh g provides a “Jantzen
filtration” of the standard modules of B̃k and shows that the irreducible B̃k modules appear in
a composition series of the standard module with multiplicities given by the Kazhdan-Lusztig
polynomials of the Weyl group of g. Though B̃k is always the affine braid group of type A, the
Weyl group of g is not necessarily of type A.
      Applying the functor Fλ to the BGG resolution of an irreducible highest weight module pro-
vides a BGG resolution for the corresponding B̃k -modules and a corresponding “Jacobi-Trudi”
identities for the characters of B̃k modules. Once again, it is interesting to note that, though B̃k
is the affine braid group of type A, it is the Weyl group of a different type which appears in this
Jacobi-Trudi identity.
      Using the general formulation for constructing Markov traces on braid groups, given for ex-
ample in [Tu1], we obtain a Markov trace on the affine braid group B̃k for every choice of g and
Uh g modules M and V .
      (a) If g = sln+1 , M = L(0) and V = L(ω1 ) this gives the Markov trace on the Hecke algebra
           studied in [Jo1] and [Wz].
      (b) If g = sl2 , M = L(0) and V = L(ω1 ) this gives the Markov trace on the Temperley-Lieb
           algebra used by Jones [Jo2].
      (c) If g = sln+1 , M = L(kωℓ ) with k and ℓ large and n very large, and V = L(ω1 ) this gives
           the Markov traces on the Hecke algebra of type B studied by [GL], [Lb], [Ic] and [Or].
      (d) If g = sln+1 , M = L(λ), where λ is “large”, and V = L(ω1 ) this gives the Markov traces
           on the cyclotomic Hecke algebras introduced by Lambropoulou [Lb] and studied in [GIM].
      (e) If g = son or g = sp2n , M = L(0) and V = L(ω1 ) this gives the Markov traces used to
           construct Kauffman polynomials.
For general g, general V , and M = L(0), this mechanism gives the traces necessary to compute the
Reshetikhin-Turaev link invariants [RT]. In some sense, this paper is a study of the representation
theory behind the generalization of the Reshetikhin-Turaev method given in [Tu2].
     In the final section of this paper we describe precisely the combinatorics of the representations
Fλ (M ) in the cases when g is type An , Bn , Cn or Dn and V is the fundamental representation.
In these cases the representations can be constructed with partitions, standard tableaux, up-down
tableaux, multisegments and the combinatorics of Young diagrams. In particular, in type A,
the functor Fλ naturally constructs the standard modules and irreducible modules of affine Hecke
algebras of type A in terms of multisegments (a classification originally obtained by Zelevinsky [Ze2]
by different methods). We then specify explicitly the correspondence between the decomposition
numbers of the affine Hecke algebra and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the symmetric group.
Using the recent results of Polo [Po] we can show that every polynomial in 1 + vZ≥0 [v] is a
decomposition number for the affine Hecke algebra.

2. Preliminaries on quantum groups
    Let Uh g be the Drinfel’d-Jimbo quantum group corresponding to a finite dimensional complex
semisimple Lie algebra g. Let us fix some notations. In particular, fix a triangular decomposition
                                                      M
                      g = n− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ ,       n+ =         gα ,       b+ = h ⊕ n+ ,
                                                     α>0


and let W be the Weyl group of g. Let h, i be the usual inner product on h∗ so that, if α is a root,
the corresponding reflection sα in W is given by

                                                      2α                                   1X
          sα λ = λ − hλ, α∨ iα,      where α∨ =             .       The element ρ =              α
                                                     hα, αi                                2 α>0

is often viewed as an element of h by using the form h, i to identify h and h∗ . We shall use the
conventions for quantum groups as in [Dr] and [LR] so that

                  q = eh/2 ,      h ⊆ Uh g,     and Uh g ∼
                                                         = U g[[h]], as algebras.

The quantum group has a triangular decomposition corresponding to that of g,

                  Uh g = Uh n− ⊗ Uh h ⊗ Uh n+        and          Uh b+ = Uh h ⊗ Uh n+ .


The category O
    If M is a Uh g module and λ ∈ h∗ the λ weight space of M is

                           Mλ = {m ∈ M | am = λ(a)m, for all a ∈ h}.

The category O is the category of Uh g modules M such that
             L
    (a) M = λ∈h∗ Mλ ,
     (b) For all m ∈ M , dim(Uh n+ m) is finite,
     (c) M is finitely generated as a Uh g module.
For µ ∈ h∗ let
         M (µ) be the Verma module of highest weight µ, and let
         L(µ) be the irreducible module of highest weight µ.
The irreducible module L(µ) is the quotient of M (µ) by a maximal proper submodule and M (µ) =
Uh g ⊗Uh b+ Cvµ+ where Cvµ+ is the one dimensional Uh b+ module spanned by a vector vµ+ such that
avµ+ = µ(a)vµ+ for a ∈ h and Uh n+ vµ+ = 0. Every module M ∈ O has a finite composition series
with factors L(µ), µ ∈ h∗ . Each of the sets

                         {[L(λ)] | λ ∈ h∗ }     and        {[M (λ)] | λ ∈ h∗ }

(where [M ] denotes the isomorphism class of the module M ) are bases of the Grothendieck group
of the category O.
     If M is a Uh g module generated by a highest weight vector of weight λ (i.e., a vector v+ such
that av+ = λ(a)v+ for a ∈ h and Uh n+ = 0) then any element of the center Z(Uh g) acts on M by
a constant,
                      zm = χλ (z)m, for z ∈ Z(Uh g), m ∈ M , χλ (z) ∈ C.
For each Uh g module M ∈ O let

                                            M                                 n
                                                                              X

                              M         =         Mλ+ν ,         where Q =          Zαi ,
                                            ν∈Q                               i=1

Then                                                       M
                                                    M=           M [λ] ,
                                                            λ

where the sum is over all integrally dominant weights λ ∈ h∗ i.e., λ ∈ h∗ such that hλ+ρ, α∨ i 6∈ Z<0
for all α ∈ R+ .
     The dot action of the Weyl group W on h∗ is given by

                               w ◦ λ = w(λ + ρ) − ρ,                  w ∈ W, λ ∈ h∗ .

For a fixed λ ∈ h∗ the stabilizer of the dot action of the integral Weyl group

                                        W λ =< sα | hλ + ρ, α∨ i ∈ Z >                           (2.1)

is the subgroup
                                   Wλ+ρ = {w ∈ W | w(λ + ρ) = λ + ρ}
and the elements of W λ ◦ λ are exactly the w ◦ λ such that w ∈ W λ is the longest element of the
coset wWλ+ρ in W λ . To summarize, there is a decomposition of the category O,
                                                           M

where the sum is over all integrally dominant weights λ ∈ h∗ and O [λ] is the full subcategory of
modules M ∈ O such that M = M [λ] . The Grothendieck group of the category O [λ] has bases

                      {[L(µ)] | µ ∈ W λ ◦ λ}               and        {[M (µ)] | µ ∈ W λ ◦ λ}.   (2.3)

Jantzen filtrations
       Following the notations for the quantum group used in [LR, §2], let h, X1 , . . . , Xr and
Y1 , . . . , Yr be the standard generators of the quantum group Uh g which satisfy the quantum Serre
relations. The Cartan involution θ: Uh g → Uh g is the algebra anti-involution defined by

                  θ(Xi ) = Yi ,       θ(Yi ) = Xi ,     and      θ(a) = a,    for a ∈ h.          (2.4)

A contravariant form on a Uh g module M is a symmetric bilinear form h, i: M × M → C such that

                           hum1 , m2 i = hm1 , θ(u)m2 i, u ∈ Uh g, m1 , m2 ∈ M.

    Fix λ ∈ h∗ and δ ∈ h∗ such that λ+tδ is integrally dominant for all small positive real numbers
t. Consider t as an indeterminate and consider the Verma module

                                   M (λ + tδ) = Uh g[t] ⊗Uh b+ [t] Cλ+tδ

as the module for Uh g[t] = C[t] ⊗C Uh g generated by a vector v+ such that av+ = (λ + tδ)(a)v+ for
a ∈ h and Uh n+ [t]v+ = 0. There is a unique contravariant form h, it : M (λ + tδ) × M (λ + tδ) → C[t]
such that hv+ , v+ it = 1. Define

         M (λ + tδ)(j) = {m ∈ M (λ + tδ) | hm, nit ∈ tj M (λ + tδ) for all n ∈ M (λ + tδ)}.

The “specialization of M (λ + tδ)(j) at t = 0” is

                  M (λ)(j) = image of M (λ + tδ)(j) in M (λ + tδ) ⊗C[t] C[t]/tC[t]

and the Jantzen filtration of M (λ) is

                                   M (λ) = M (λ)(0) ⊇ M (λ)(1) ⊇ · · · .                          (2.5)

By [Jz, Theorem 5.3], the Jantzen filtration is a filtration of M (λ) by Uh g modules, the module
M (λ)(1) is a maximal proper submodule of M (λ) and each quotient M (λ)(i) /M (λ)(i+1) has a
nondegenerate contravariant form. It is known [Bb] that the Jantzen filtration does not depend on
the choice of δ. It is a deep theorem [BB] that the quotients M (λ)(i) /M (λ)(i+1) are semisimple and

The BGG resolution
     Not all simple modules L(λ) in the category O have a BGG resolution. The general form of
the BGG resolution given by Gabber and Joseph [GJ] is as follows.
     Let µ ∈ h∗ be such that −(µ + ρ) is dominant and regular and let WJν be a parabolic subgroup
of the integral Weyl group W µ . Let w0 be the longest element of WJµ and fix ν = w0 ◦ µ. Define a
resolution

where v → w means that there is a (not necessarily simple) root α such that w = sα v and
ℓ(w) = ℓ(v) − 1, the maps ιv,w are fixed choices of inclusions

                           ιv,w : M (v ◦ ν) ֒→ M (w ◦ ν),      and   εv,w = ±1,

are fixed choices of signs such that

             εu,v εv,w = −εu,v′ εv′ ,w         if u → v → w,    u → v′ → w                   and v 6= v′ .

Gabber and Joseph [GJ] prove that the sequence (2.7) is exact in this general setting. See [BGG]
and [Dx,7.8.14] for the original form of the BGG resolution. From the exactness of (2.7) it follows
that if −(µ + ρ) is dominant and regular then, in the Grothendieck group of the category O,
                                           X

3. Affine braid group representations and the functors Fλ
     There are three common ways of depicting affine braids [Cr], [GL], [Jo3]:
     (a) As braids in a (slightly thickened) cylinder,
     (b) As braids in a (slightly thickened) annulus,
     (c) As braids with a flagpole.
See Figure 1. The multiplication is by placing one cylinder on top of another, placing one annulus
inside another, or placing one flagpole braid on top of another. These are equivalent formulations:
an annulus can be made into a cylinder by turning up the edges, and a cylindrical braid can be
made into a flagpole braid by putting a flagpole down the middle of the cylinder and pushing the
pole over to the left so that the strings begin and end to its right.
     The affine braid group is the group B̃k formed by the affine braids with k strands. The affine
braid group B̃k can be presented by generators T1 , T2 , . . . , Tk−1 and X ε1

By drawing pictures of the corresponding affine braids it is easy to check that the X all commute
with each other and so X = hX εi | 1 ≤ i ≤ ki is an abelian subgroup of B̃k . Let L ∼ = Zk be the
free abelian group generated by ε1 , . . . , εk . Then

    Let Uh g be the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group associated to a finite dimensional complex
semisimple Lie algebra g. Let M be a Uh g-module in the category O and let V be a finite
dimensional Uh g module. Define Ři , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, and Ř02 in EndUh g (M ⊗ V ⊗k ) by
                         ⊗(i−1)                                           ⊗(k−i−1)                                                                                                                         ⊗(k−1)

Proof. It is necessary to show that
     (a) Ři Řj = Řj Ři ,         if |i − j| > 1,
            2              2
     (b) Ř0 Ři = Ři Ř0 , i > 2,
     (c) Ři Ři+1 Ři = Ři+1 Ři Ři+1 , 1 ≥ i ≥ k − 2,
     (d) Ř02 Ř1 Ř02 Ř1 = Ř1 Ř02 Ř1 Ř02 .

case of the braid relation (2.12). The relation (d) is also a consequence of the braid relation:

        Ř02 Ř1 Ř02 Ř1 = (ŘV M ŘM V ⊗ id)(id ⊗ ŘV V )(ŘV M ŘM V ⊗ id)(id ⊗ ŘV V )
                     = (ŘV M ⊗ id) (id ⊗ ŘV V )(ŘV V ⊗ id)(id ⊗ ŘM V )(ŘM V ⊗ id)(id ⊗ ŘV V )
                                    |                  {z                }
                     = (id ⊗ ŘV V )(ŘM V ⊗ id)(id ⊗ ŘV M ) (ŘV V ⊗ id)(id ⊗ ŘM V )(ŘM V ⊗ id)

                                           z             }|              {
                     = (id ⊗ ŘM V )(ŘV M ŘM V ⊗ id)(id ⊗ ŘV V )(ŘV M ŘM V ⊗ id)

     A B̃k module N is calibrated if the abelian group X defined in (3.4) acts semisimply on N , i.e.
if N has a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors for the action of X ε1 , . . . , X εk .

Proposition 3.6. If M and V are finite dimensional Uh g modules then the B̃k module M ⊗ V ⊗k
defined in Proposition 3.5 is calibrated.
Proof. Let P + be the set of dominant integral weights. Since M and V are finite dimensional the
Uh g-module M ⊗ V ⊗i is semisimple for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k and

where mλ ∈ Z≥0 and (M ⊗ V ⊗i )[λ] ∼ =     λ∈P + L(λ)

                                                         . Given a basis of M ⊗ V ⊗(i−1) which
                                  ⊗(i−1)
                                            L            ⊗(i−1) [µ]
respects the decomposition M ⊗ V          =    µ (M ⊗ V        ) one can construct a basis of
       ⊗i
M ⊗V      which respects the decomposition

              M ⊗ V ⊗i = (M ⊗ V ⊗(i−1) ) ⊗ V =       ((M ⊗ V ⊗(i−1) )[µ] ⊗ V [ν] )[λ] .

Since ((M ⊗LV ⊗(i−1) )[µ] ⊗ V [ν] )[λ] ⊆ (M ⊗ V ⊗i )[λ] this new basis respects the decomposition
M ⊗ V ⊗i = λ (M ⊗ V ⊗i )[λ] . This procedure produces, inductively, a basis B of M ⊗ V ⊗k which
respects the decompositions

                                                                            λ

acts diagonally on the basis B.

       Define an anti-involution on B̃k by
                                          θ̃(Ti ) = Ti        and       θ̃(X λ ) = X λ ,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and λ ∈ L. A contravariant form on a B̃k module N is a symmetric bilinear form
h, i: N × N → C such that
                                  hbn1 , n2 i = hn1 , θ̃(b)n2 i      for n1 , n2 ∈ N , b ∈ B̃k .
Suppose M is a Uh g-module in the category O and V is a finite dimensional Uh g module. Let h, iM
and h, iV be Uh g-contravariant forms on M and V respectively. By (2.16),
                                  hŘV V (v1 ⊗ v2 ), v1′ ⊗ v2′ i = hv1 ⊗ v2 , ŘV V (v1′ ⊗ v2′ )i

for m, m′ ∈ M , v, v′ ∈ V . Thus it follows that the form h, i on M ⊗ V ⊗k given by

The functor Fλ
     Fix a finite dimensional Uh g module V and an integrally dominant weight λ in h∗ . Let Õk be
the category of finite dimensional B̃k modules and define a functor

                           Fλ :   O     −→ Õk
                                                                                                      (3.8)
                                  M     7−→ HomUh g (M (λ), M ⊗ V ⊗k ).


Proposition 3.9. Let λ be a integrally dominant weight in h∗ . The functor Fλ is exact.
Proof. The functor Fλ is the composition of two functors: the functor · ⊗ V ⊗k and the functor
HomU (M (λ), ·). The first is exact since V ⊗k is finite dimensional and the second is exact because
when λ is integrally dominant M (λ) is projective, see [Jz, p. 72].

     The following proposition gives equivalent ways of expressing the B̃k -module Fλ (M ). We use
the notation                                     X
                               n− (M ⊗ V ⊗k ) =     Yi (M ⊗ V ⊗k ),                          (3.10)
                                                      i

where the Yi are the Chevalley generators of n . In the case of U g-modules, the notation n− (M ⊗
                                                  −

V ⊗k ) is self explanatory—the notation in (3.10) is simply a way to define the same object for the
quantum group Uh g.

Proposition 3.11. Let M be a Uh g module in the category O and let V be a finite dimensional
Uh g-module. Let λ be an integrally dominant weight. Then
                                                                                            

as B̃k modules.
Proof. Since the action of B̃k on M ⊗ V ⊗k commutes with the action of Uh g on M ⊗ V ⊗k , all three
vector spaces in the statement are B̃k modules, and in all three cases, the B̃k action comes from
the B̃k action on M ⊗ V ⊗k . The isomorphisms come from the fact that these vector spaces are
naturally identified with the vector space of highest weight vectors of weight λ in M ⊗ V ⊗k . This
identification is done as follows.
(a) If m ⊗ n is a highest weight vector of weight λ in M ⊗ V ⊗k and vλ+ is the highest weight vector
of weight λ in the Verma module M (λ) then

                                   φ:    M (λ)       →      M ⊗ V ⊗k
                                          v+        7−→      m⊗n

uniquely determines a homomorphism in HomU (M (λ), M ⊗ V ⊗k ). So HomU (M (λ), M ⊗ V ⊗k ) can
be identified with the space of highest weight vectors of weight λ in M ⊗ V ⊗k .
(b) If m ⊗ n is a highest weight vector of weight µ in M ⊗ V ⊗k then there is a unique integrally
dominant weight ν such that µ ∈ W ◦ ν. Since λ is integrally dominant any highest weight vector
of weight λ in M ⊗ V ⊗k is an element of (M ⊗ V ⊗k )[λ] . Furthermore,
                                                    M
                               (M ⊗ V ⊗k )[λ] =           ((M ⊗ V ⊗k )[λ] )µ                         (3.12)

where the sum is over all µ ≤ λ in dominance i.e., over all µ such that µ = λ − ν with ν a
nonnegative linear combination of positive roots. Thus ((M ⊗ V ⊗k )[λ] )λ consists exactly of the
highest weight vectors of weight λ.
(c) It follows from (3.12) that (n− M [λ] )λ = 0. So the canonical surjection M [λ] → (M [λ] /n− M [λ] )
produces a vector space isomorphism

The last isomorphism in the statement of the proposition now follows from

4. The B̃k modules Mλ/µ and Lλ/µ
     Let λ be integrally dominant and let µ ∈ h∗ . Define B̃k modules

                         Mλ/µ = Fλ (M (µ))               and       Lλ/µ = Fλ (L(µ)).              (4.1)

The following lemma is the main tool for studying the structure of these B̃k modules.

Lemma 4.2. ([Jz, Theorem 2.2], [Dx, Lemma 7.6.14]) Let E be a finite dimensional Uh g module
and let {ei } be a basis of E consisting of weight vectors ordered so that i < j if wt(ei ) < wt(ej ).
Suppose M is a Uh g module generated by a highest weight vector vµ+ of weight µ. Set
                                                 X
                                        Mi =           Uh n− (vµ+ ⊗ ej ).
                                                 j≥i


Then
(a) M ⊗ E = M1 ⊇ M2 ⊇ · · · is a filtration of Uh g modules such that Mi /Mi+1 is 0 or is a highest
    weight module of highest weight µ + wt(ei ).
(b) If M = M (µ) then Mi /Mi+1 ∼= M (µ + wt(ei )).

     The braid group Bk is the subgroup of B̃k generated by T1 , . . . , Tk−1 . By restriction, both
Mλ/µ and V ⊗k = L(0) ⊗ V ⊗k are Bk modules.
     There is a unique Uh g contravariant form h, iM on the Verma module M (w ◦ µ) determined
      +     +                   +
by hvw◦µ , vw◦µ iM = 1 where vw◦µ     is the generating highest weight vector of M (w ◦ µ). As in
(2.15), this form together with a nondegenerate Uh g contravariant form h, iV on V gives a Uh g
contravariant forms h, iV ⊗k and h, i on V ⊗k and M (w ◦ µ) ⊗ V ⊗k , respectively.
     With these notations at hand we use Lemma 4.2 to prove the fundamental facts about the B̃k
modules Mλ/µ and Lλ/µ defined in (4.1).

Proposition 4.3. Let λ, µ be integrally dominant weights and w ∈ W .
(a) As Bk modules, Mλ/w◦µ ∼= (V ⊗k )λ−w◦µ
(b) Mλ/w◦µ ∼
           = Mλ/y◦µ if Wλ+ρ wWµ+ρ = Wλ+ρ yWµ+ρ .

(c) Use the same notation h, i for the Uh g contravariant form h, i on M (w ◦ µ) ⊗ V ⊗k and the B̃k
    contravariant form on Mλ/(w◦µ) obtained by restriction of h, i to the subspace (M (w ◦ µ) ⊗
          [λ]
    V ⊗k )λ . Then
                                                   Mλ/(w◦µ)
                                        Lλ/w◦µ ∼ =            .
                                                     radh, i

(d) Assume w is maximal length in wWµ+ρ . If Lλ/(w◦µ) 6= 0 then
     (1) λ − w ◦ µ is a weight of V ⊗k ,
     (2) w is maximal length in Wλ+ρ wWµ+ρ .
(e) If µ is a dominant integral weight then
                            n                                                    o
                                              hµ+ρ,α∨
                                                    i i
                     Lλ/µ ∼
                          = v ∈ (V ⊗k )λ−µ | Xi         v = 0, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. .

                +
Proof. (a) Let vw◦µ  be the generating highest weight vector of M (w ◦ µ) and, for n ∈ V ⊗k let
    +                         +
pr(vw◦µ ⊗ n) be the image of vw◦µ ⊗ n in (M ⊗ V ⊗k )/n− (M ⊗ V ⊗k ). Then, since λ is integrally
dominant, Lemma 4.2 shows that

                                    (V ⊗k )λ−w◦µ     −→           Mλ/(w◦µ)
                                                                     +                              (4.4)
                                          n          7−→         pr(vw◦µ ⊗ n)

is a vector space isomorphism. This is a Bk -module isomorphism since the Bk action on M (w ◦
µ) ⊗ V ⊗k commutes with n− and fixes vw◦µ
                                        +
                                           .
(b) It is sufficient to show that Mλ/w◦µ ∼
                                         = Mλ/(si w◦µ) for all simple reflections si ∈ Wλ+ρ such
that si w > w. Applying the exact functor Fλ to the Verma module inclusion

                    M (si w ◦ µ) ֒→ M (w ◦ µ)            gives      Mλ/si w◦µ ֒→ Mλ/w◦µ ,

an inclusion of B̃k -modules. Since si (λ − w ◦ µ) = si (λ + ρ) − si w(µ + ρ) = λ + ρ − si w(µ + ρ) =
λ − (zw) ◦ µ there is a (vector space) isomorphism of weight spaces

                                          (V ⊗ )λ−w◦µ ∼  ⊗k
                                                      = Vλ−si w◦µ
                                                                  .

(This isomorphism can be realized by Lusztig’s braid group action [CP, §8.1-8.2] Ti : (V ⊗k )λ−w◦µ →
(V ⊗k )si (λ−w◦µ) ). Thus, by part (a), the B̃k -module inclusion Mλ/si w◦µ ֒→ Mλ/w◦µ is an isomor-
phism.
(c) Use the notations for the bilinear forms on M (w ◦ µ) and V ⊗k as given in the paragraph before
the statement of the proposition. Let {bi } be an orthonormal basis of V ⊗k with respect to h, iV ⊗k .
If r ∈ radh, iM then

            hr ⊗ b, s ⊗ b′ i = hr, siM hb, b′ iV ⊗k = 0, for all s ∈ M (w ◦ µ), b, b′ ∈ V ⊗k ,
                                                                                P
and so (radh, iM ) ⊗ V ⊗k ⊆ radh, i. Conversely, if ri ∈ M (w ◦ µ) such that       ri ⊗ bi ∈ radh, i then
                
X                    X
           0=        ri ⊗ bi , s ⊗ bj =   hri , siM δij = hri , si,   for all s ∈ M (w ◦ µ).
                    i                       i

So ri ∈ radh, iM and thus radh, i ⊆ radh, iM ⊗ V ⊗k . By the Uh g contravariance of h, i
                                                   [λ]

                                                                        µ

for integrally dominant weights λ, µ with λ 6= µ. Thus
                                                                   [λ]

                                                                                                    [λ]
where h, i is the restriction of the form on M (w ◦ µ) ⊗ V ⊗k to (M (w ◦ µ) ⊗ V ⊗k )λ . Thus

                               [λ]                       [λ]
        (M (w ◦ µ) ⊗ V ⊗k )λ   (M (w ◦ µ) ⊗ V ⊗k )λ
                             =                    [λ]

                             =             ⊗V           = (L(w ◦ µ) ⊗ V ⊗k )λ = Lλ/(w◦µ) ,
                                  radh, iM            λ

where the isomorphism is a consequence of the fact that, because λ is an integrally dominant
                               [λ]
weight, the functor (· ⊗ V ⊗k )λ is exact (Prop. 3.9).
(d) If λ − w ◦ µ is not a weight of V ⊗k then, by part (a), Mλ/w◦µ = 0. Since the functor Fλ is
exact and L(w ◦ µ) is a quotient of M (w ◦ µ), Lλ/w◦µ is a quotient of Mλ/w◦µ . Thus Mλ/w◦µ = 0
implies Lλ/w◦µ = 0.
     Assume that w is not the longest element of Wλ+ρ wWµ+ρ . Then there is a positive root α > 0
such that sα ∈ Wλ+ρ and sα w > w. Since sα wWµ+ρ 6= wWµ+ρ there is an inclusion of Verma
modules M (sα w ◦ µ) ⊆ M (w ◦ µ) and Fλ (L(µ)) is a quotient of Fλ (M (w ◦ µ))/Fλ(M (sαw ◦ µ)).
On the other hand, by part (b),

                                                         Mλ/w◦µ           Fλ (M (w ◦ µ))
              Mλ/sα w◦µ ∼
                        = Mλ/w◦µ ,          and so         λ/s  w◦µ
                                                                    =                      .
                                                         M    α       Fλ (M (sαw ◦ µ)) = 0

Thus Fλ (L(w ◦ µ)) = 0.

see [Dx, 7.2.7]. Thus, by (c) and the vector space isomorphism (4.4) it follows that, as vector

For any k ≥ 0, pr(Yik+1 ⊗ n) = pr(Yi (Yik vµ+ ⊗ n) − Yik vµ+ ⊗ Yi n) = − pr(Yik vµ+ ⊗ Yi n), and so, by

Remark 4.6. In the case when g is type An−1 and V = L(ω1 ) is the n-dimensional fundamental
representation the converse to Proposition 4.3b also holds (see [Su] Prop. 2.3.4 and [Ze2] Th. 6.1b).
The following example shows that this is not true in general. In the notation of Section 6, let

                g be of type Dn ,         µ = ε1 + · · · + εn−1 ,     and        V = L(ω1 ),
                                                                                                  +
the 2n-dimensional fundamental representation. If λ± = ε1 + · · · + εn−1 ± εn then Mλ                 /µ

    −
Mλ /µ are isomorphic (one dimensional and simple) B̃1 modules.
     Proposition 4.3d gives a necessary condition on λ/w ◦ µ for the B̃k -module Lλ/w◦µ to be
nonzero. The following lemma gives an alternative characterization of this condition. This will be
useful for analyzing the combinatorics of the examples in Section 6.

Lemma 4.7. Let P be the weight lattice and let λ be an integrally dominant weight. Then
Wλ+ρ acts on λ − P by the dot action. This action has fundamental domain

          −
         Cλ+ρ = {µ ∈ λ − P | hµ + ρ, α∨ i ∈ Z≤0 for all α > 0 such that hλ + ρ, α∨ i = 0}.

The following are equivalent.
               −
     (a) µ ∈ Cλ+ρ   ,
    (b) µ = w ◦ ν with ν integrally dominant and wλ longest in Wλ+ρ wλ .
               λ

     (c) µ = wµ̃λ ◦ µ̃ with wµ̃λ longest in Wλ+ρ wµ̃λ Wµ+ρ .
Proof. (b) and (c) are equivalent since Wµ+ρ is the stabilizer of µ under the ◦ action.
(b) =⇒ (a): If sα ∈ Wλ+ρ then hλ + ρ, α∨ i = 0 and ℓ(sα wλ ) < ℓ(wλ ). So (wλ )−1 α < 0 and
hµ + ρ, α∨ i ∈ Z since λ − ν ∈ P . Thus,

          hµ + ρ, α∨ i = hwλ ◦ µ + ρ, α∨ i = hwλ (µ + ρ), α∨ i = hν + ρ, (wλ )−1 α∨ i ∈ Z≤0 ,

                                        −
since ν is integrally dominant. So µ ∈ Cλ+ρ .
                        −
(a) =⇒ (b): Let µ ∈ Cλ+ρ    and fix ν integrally dominant and w ∈ W such that µ = w ◦ ν. Let
                         ∨
α > 0 such that hλ + ρ, α i = 0. Then

                                hν + ρ, w−1 α∨ i = hµ + ρ, α∨ i ∈ Z≤0

and so w−1 α < 0. So ℓ(sα w) < ℓ(w). Since this is true for all α > 0 such that hλ + ρ, α∨ i = 0 it
follows that w is maximal length in its coset Wλ+ρ w.

     In the classical case, when g is type An and V = L(ω1 ) is the n + 1 dimensional fundamental
representation the B̃k -module Lλ/w◦µ is a simple B̃k -module whenever it is nonzero (see [Su]). As
the following Proposition shows, this is a very special phenomenon.

Proposition 4.8. Assume that V = L(ν) for a dominant integral weight ν. If the B̃k -module
Fλ (µ) is irreducible (or 0) for all k, all dominant integral weights µ, and all integrally dominant
weights λ then
(a) g is type An , Bn , Cn or G2 and V = L(ω1 ), and
(b) the action of the subgroup Bk of B̃k generates EndUh g (V ⊗k ).
Proof. (a) If µ is large dominant integral weight (for example, we may take µ = nρ, n >> 0) then,
as a Uh g-module,                               M
                                   L(µ) ⊗ V ∼=      L(µ + wt(b)),
                                                    b

where the sum is over a basis of V consisting of weight vectors and wt(b) is the weight of the vector
b. The group B̃1 is generated by the element X ε1 which acts on a summand L(λ) in L(µ)⊗V by the
constant q hλ,λ+2ρi−hµ,µ+2ρi−hν,ν+2ρi . Then Fλ (L(µ)) is the L(λ) isotypic component of L(µ) ⊗ V
and these are simple B̃1 modules only if all the values

            hµ + wt(b), µ + wt(b) + 2ρi − hµ, µ + 2ρi − hν, ν + 2ρi
                                                                                                 (4.9)
                                        = 2hµ + ρ, wt(b)i + hwt(b), wt(b)i − hν, ν + 2ρi,

as b ranges over a weight basis of V , are distinct. It follows that all weight spaces of V must be
one dimensional. This means that
     (a) g is type An , Bn , Cn , Dn , E6 , E7 or G2 and V = L(ω1 ), or
     (b) g is type An and V = L(kω1 ) or V = (kωn ) for some k, or
      (c) g is type Bn and V = L(ωn ), or
     (d) g is type Dn and V = L(ωn−1 ) or V = L(ωn ).
Most of the weights of these representations lie in a single W -orbit. If γ and γ ′ are two distinct
weights of V which are in the same W -orbit then hγ, γi = hγ ′ , γ ′ i. If µ = nρ with n >> 0 then the
condition that all the values in (4.9) be distinct forces that

               (2n + 1)hρ, γi = 2hµ + ρ, γi =  6    2hµ + ρ, γ ′ i = (2n + 1)hρ, γ ′ i.
               P                      P
Writing γ = ν − i ci αi and γ ′ = ν − i c′i αi with ci , c′i ∈ Z>0 the last equation becomes
                                          X                    X
                               (2n + 1) ·    ci 6= (2n + 1) ·      c′i .
                                            i                  i

Finally, an easy case by case check verifies that the only choices of V in (a-d) above which satisfy
this last condition for all weights in the W -orbit of the highest weight are those listed in the
statement of the proposition.
(b) Let Zk = EndUh g (V ⊗k ). As a (Uh g, Zk )-bimodule
                                               M
                                      V ⊗k ∼=      L(λ) ⊗ Zkλ ,
                                                λ

where Zkλ is an irreducible Zk -module and the sum is over all dominant integral weights for which
the irreducible Uh g-module L(λ) appears in V ⊗k . By restriction Zkλ is an Bk -module and this is
the B̃k -module Fλ (L(0)) which, by assumption, is simple. Since L(0) is the trivial module X ε1
acts on Fλ (L(0)) by the identity and so Fλ (L(0)) is simple as a Bk -module. Thus the simple
Zk -modules in V ⊗k coincide exactly with the simple Bk -modules in V ⊗k and it follows that Bk
generates Zk = EndUh g (V ⊗k ).

Jantzen filtrations for affine braid group representations
      Applying the functor Fλ to the Jantzen filtration of M (µ) produces a filtration of Mλ/µ ,

                      Mλ/µ = Fλ (M (µ)) = Fλ (M (µ)(0)) ⊇ Fλ (M (µ)(1)) ⊇ · · · .                 (4.10)

An argument of Suzuki [Su, Thm. 4.3.5] shows that this filtration can be obtained directly from
the B̃k -contravariant form h, it on

                                                                                [λ+tδ]

which is the restriction of the Uh g contravariant form h, it on (M (µ + tδ) ⊗ V ⊗k ), see (2.5) and
(3.7). To do this define

         Mλ+tδ/µ+tδ (j) = {m ∈ M(λ+tδ)/(µ+tδ) | hm, nit = tj C[t] for all n ∈ Mλ+tδ/µ+tδ }

Since, for different λ, the subspaces (M (µ + tδ) ⊗ V )λ+tδ are mutually orthogonal with respect
to the Uh g contravariant form h, it on (M (µ + tδ) ⊗ V ⊗k ),

                                      [λ+tδ]                      [λ+tδ]
          (M (µ + tδ)(j) ⊗ V ⊗k )λ+tδ ⊆ (M (µ + tδ) ⊗ V ⊗k )λ+tδ (j) = M(λ+tδ)/(µ+tδ) (j).

                                              [λ+tδ]                  P
On the other hand, if u ∈ (M (µ+tδ)⊗V ⊗k )λ+tδ (j) then write u = i ai ⊗bi where ai ∈ M (µ+tδ)
and bi is an orthonormal basis of V ⊗k . Then, for all v ∈ M (µ+tδ), and all k, hak , vit = hu, v⊗bk it ∈
                                          [λ+tδ]
tj C[t] and so u ∈ (M (µ + tδ)(j) ⊗ V ⊗k )λ+tδ . So

                                   Fλ+tδ (M (µ + tδ))(j) = M(λ+tδ)/(µ+tδ) (j)

and the filtrations in (4.10) and (4.11) are identical.

Proposition 4.12. Let λ and µ be integrally dominant weights and let w, y ∈ W µ be elements
of maximal length in Wλ+ρ wWµ+ρ and Wλ+ρ yWµ+ρ respectively. Then multiplicities of Lλ/y◦µ in
the filtration (4.11) are given by

                          (M

where Pwy (v) is the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial for the Weyl group W µ .
Proof. Since the functor Fλ is exact this result follows from the Beilinson-Bernstein theorem (2.6).
The condition on y is necessary for the module Lλ/y◦µ to be nonzero.

Proof. The fact that mtk as defined in the statement of the Theorem satisfies (1)-(4) in the definition
of a Markov trace follows exactly as in [LR] Theorem 3.10c. The formula for the parameter z is
derived in [LR, (3.9) and Thm. 3.10(2)].
     It remains to check (5). The proof is a combination of the argument used in [Or] Theorem
5.3 and the argument in the proof of [LR] Theorem 3.10c. Let εk : EndU (M ⊗ V ⊗k ) → EndU (M ⊗
V ⊗(k−1) ) be given by

Theorem 5.11. Let M = L(µ) and V = L(ν) be finite dimensional irreducible Uh g-modules. The
weights of the Markov trace on the affine braid group defined in Theorem 5.4 are
                                                   dimq (L(λ))

Proof. Since M ⊗ V ⊗k is finite dimensional and semisimple the algebra Z̃k = EndU (M ⊗ V ⊗k ) is
a finite dimensional semisimple algebra. Schur’s lemma can be used to show that, as a (Uh g, Z̃k )
bimodule,                                     M
                                  M ⊗ V ⊗k ∼=      L(λ) ⊗ Lλ/µ ,                          (5.12)

              λ/µ
where the L      are the irreducible Z̃k modules. In the notation of (4.1), Lλ/µ = Fλ (L(µ)) and
 λ/µ
χZ̃ is the character of Lλ/µ . Taking the quantum trace on both sides of (5.12) gives

            trq (a) = Tr(e−hρ a) =      Tr(e−hρ , L(λ))χZ̃ (a) =   trq (L(λ))χZ̃ (a).

The result follows by dividing both sides by dimq (L(µ)) dimq (V )k .

Affine and cyclotomic Hecke algebras
    Let q ∈ C∗ . The affine Hecke algebra H̃k is the quotient of the group algebra CB̃k of the affine
braid group by the relations

The affine Hecke algebra H̃k is an infinite dimensional algebra with a very interesting representation
theory (see [KL] and [CG]). With X as in (3.4) the subalgebra
                          C[X] = C[X ±ε1 , . . . , X ±εk ] = span {X λ | λ ∈ L}
is a commutative subalgebra of H̃k . It is a theorem of Bernstein and Zelevinsky (see [RR, Theorem
4.12]) that the center of H̃k is the ring of symmetric (Laurent) polynomials in X ±ε1 , . . . , X ±εk ,
                              Z(H̃k ) = C[X]Sk = C[X ±ε1 , . . . , X ±εk ]Sk .
If w ∈ Sk define Tw = Ti1 · · · Tip if w = si1 · · · sip is a reduced word for w in terms of the generating
reflections si = (i, i + 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, of Sk . Then, with X λ as in (3.4)
                              {X λ Tw | λ ∈ L, w ∈ Sk }      is a basis of H̃k .
    Let u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C. The cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hr,1,n with parameters u1 , . . . , ur , q is the
quotient of the affine Hecke algebra by the relation
                               (X ε1 − u1 )(X ε1 − u2 ) · · · (X ε1 − ur ) = 0.                      (6.2)
The algebra Hr,1,n is a deformation of the group algebra of the complex reflection group G(r, 1, n) =
(Z/rZ) ≀ Sn and is of dimension r n n!. It was introduced by Ariki and Koike [AK] and its represen-
tations and its connection to the affine Hecke algebra have been well studied ([Ar],[AK],[Gk]).

The affine and cyclotomic BMW algebras
     Fix q, z ∈ C∗ and an infinite number of values Q1 , Q2 , . . . in C. The affine BMW (Birman-
Murakami-Wenzl) algebra Z̃k is the quotient of the group algebra CB̃k of the affine braid group by
the relations
  (6.3a)    (Ti − z −1 )(Ti + q −1 )(Ti − q) = 0,
  (6.3b)    Ei Ti±1 = Ti±1 Ei = z ∓1 Ei ,
                 ±1                                                                     ±1
  (6.3c)    Ei Ti−1 Ei = z ±1 Ei and                                               Ei Ti+1 Ei = z ±1 Ei ,
  (6.3d)    E1 (X ε1 )r E1 = Qr E1 ,
 (6.3e) E1 X ε1 T1 X ε1 = z −1 E1 ,
where the Ei , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, are defined by the equations

                                                    Ti − Ti−1
                                                              = 1 − Ei ,                                                                               1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.                                                                          (6.4)

The classical BMW algebra is the subalgebra Zk of the affine BMW algebra which is generated by
T1 , . . . , Tk−1 , and E1 , . . . , Ek−1 . Fix u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C. The cyclotomic BMW algebra Zr,1,k is the
quotient of the affine BMW algebra by the relation

                                             (X ε1 − u1 )(X ε1 − u2 ) · · · (X ε1 − ur ) = 0.                                                                                                                                                  (6.6)

     Although the affine BMW algebras have been “in the air” for some time we are not aware of
any existing literature. The “degenerate” version of these algebras were defined by Nazarov [Nz]
who called them “degenerate affine Wenzl algebras”. The relation between his algebras and the
affine BMW algebras Z̃k is analogous to the relation between the graded Hecke algebras (sometimes
called the degenerate affine Hecke algebras) and the affine Hecke algebras (see [Lu]). The cyclotomic
BMW algebras have been defined and studied by [Hä1-2]. They are quotients of the affine BMW
algebras in the same way that cyclotomic Hecke algebras are quotients of affine Hecke algebras.
The classical BMW algebras Zk = Z1,1,k have been studied in [Wz2], [HR], [Mu], [LR] and many
other works.
     Elements of the affine BMW algebra can be viewed as linear combinations of affine tangles.
An affine tangle has k strands and a flagpole just as in the case of an affine braid, but there is no
restriction that a strand must connect an upper vertex to a lower vertex. Let X ε1 and Ti be the
affine braids given in (3.1) and let

Schur-Weyl duality for affine and cyclotomic Hecke and BMW algebras

     In order to explicitly compute the representations of affine and cyclotomic Hecke algebras and
BMW algebras which are obtained by applying the functors Fλ we need to fix notations for working
with the representations of finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebras of classical type.

Theorem 6.17. Let g be the simple complex Lie algebra of classical type, U = Uh g the corre-
sponding quantum group and let V = L(ω1 ) be the irreducible of Uh g of highest weight ω1 . For
each M ∈ O let Φk : B̃k → EndU (M ⊗ V ⊗k ) be the affine braid group representation defined in
Proposition 3.5.

    this Type An case use a different normalization of the map Φk and set Φk (Ti ) = q 1/(n+1) Ři .)

Proof. (a) It is only necessary to show that Φk (Ti ) = q 1/(n+1) Ři satisfies (q 1/(n+1) Ři )2 = (q −
q −1 )(q 1/(n+1) Ři ) + 1 for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. This is proved in [LR, Prop. 4.4].
(c) The arguments establishing the relations (6.3a-c) in the definition of the affine BMW algebra
are exactly as in [LR, Prop. 5.10]. It remains to establish (6.3d-e). The element E1 in the affine
BMW algebra acts on V ⊗2 as x · pr0 where pr0 is the unique Uh g-invariant projection onto the
invariants in V ⊗2 and x is as in (6.5). Using the identity (6.9) the pictorial equalities

it follows that Φ2 (E1 X ε1 T1 X ε1 ) acts as xz · ŘL(0),M ŘM,L(0) (idM ⊗ pr0 ). By (2.11), this is equal to

establishing the relation in (6.3d).
      Since Φ2 (E1 ) acts as x · (idM ⊗ pr0 ) on M ⊗ V ⊗2 the morphism Φ2 (E1 X rε1 E1 ) is a morphism
from M ⊗ L(0) → M ⊗ L(0). Since M = M ⊗ L(0) is a highest weight module this morphism is
Qr · idM , for some Qr ∈ C. By the results of Drinfeld [Dr] and Reshetikhin [Re] (see [Ba, p. 250]),
28                                         rosa orellana and arun ram

the action of the morphism Φ2 (E1 X rε1 E1 ) corresponds to the action of a central element of Uh g
on M . Thus the constant Qr depends only on the central character of M .
(b) Let b1 , . . . , br be the addable boxes of µ and consider the action of X ε1 on M ⊗V = L(µ)⊗L(ω1 ).
We will show that Φk (X ε1 ) = Ř02 satisfies the relation (Ř02 −u1 ) · · · (Ř02 −ur ) = 0, where ui = q 2c(bi ) .
By (2.11) and (2.14) it follows that

L(µ ) in the tensor product M ⊗ V = L(µ) ⊗ L(ω1 ), and c(µ /µ) is the content of the box µ+ /µ
     +                                                               +
                                                                                                +
which is added to µ to get µ+ . Thus Ř02 is a diagonal operator with eigenvalues q 2c(µ /µ) and so
it satisfies the equation (6.2).
(d) Using the appropriate case of the decomposition rule for L(µ) ⊗ L(ω1 ), the proof of the relation
(X ε1 − u1 ) · · · (X ε1 − ur ) = 0 is as in (b). The values of c̃(µ± , µ) are determined from (6.16). To
compute the value of Qr note that Φ2 (E1 X rε1 E1 ) = Φ2 (ε1 (X rε1 )E1 ), in the notations of the proof
of Theorem 5.4. Thus Qr is determined by the formula in Theorem 5.4 and the decomposition of
L(µ) ⊗ L(ω1 ) in (6.14).

Remark. The parameters in Q1 , Q2 , . . . ∈ C needed in Theorem 6.17c can be determined by using
the formula of Baumann [Ba, Theorem 1] which characterizes Qr in terms of the values Q1 given
in (5.8). To do this it is necessary to use formula (5.8) for Q1 several times: λ is always the highest
weight of M , but many different µ will be needed. Note that the proof of the formula (5.8) for Q1
in [TW] does not require λ to be dominant integral.

     The following theorem provides an analogue of Schur-Weyl duality for the affine Hecke alge-
bras, cyclotomic Hecke algebras, affine BMW algebras and cyclotomic BMW algebras. Alternative
Schur-Weyl dualities have been given by Chari-Pressley [CP2] for the case of affine Hecke alge-
bras and by Sakamoto and Shoji [SS] for cyclotomic Hecke algebras. Cherednik [Ch] also used
a Schur-Weyl duality for the affine Hecke algebra which is different from the Schur-Weyl duality
given here.

Theorem 6.18. Assume that g is not of type Dn . Let µ be a dominant integral weight and let
M = L(µ). In each of the cases given in Theorem 6.17 the representation Φk is surjective.
Proof. Part (a) is a consequence of (b) since the representation of H̃k in (a) is the composition of
the representation Φk : Hr,1,k → EndUh g (L(µ) ⊗ V ⊗k ) from (b) with the surjective algebra homo-
morphism H̃k → Hr,1,k coming from the definition of Hr,1,k . Similarly part (d) is a consequence
of part (c). The proof of the surjectivity of the representation in Theorem 6.17b and Theorem
6.17d are exactly the same as the proofs of [LR, Cor. 4.15] and [LR, Cor. 5.22], respectively. The
case considered there is the µ = 0 case but all the arguments there generalize verbatim to the case
when µ is an arbitrary dominant integral weight. In [LR, §4] the elements X εi in the affine braid
group are denoted Di . The assumption n >> k in [LR] is uncessary for this theorem if the full
decomposition rule given in (6.14) is used.
     The main point is that the eigenvalues of X ε1 , . . . , X εi separate the components of the decom-
position of L(µ) ⊗ V ⊗i . By induction it is sufficient to check that the eigenvalues of X ε1 distiguish
the components of L(λ) ⊗ V for all λ. By (2.10), (2.11) and (2.14), the eigenvalues of X εi are
                   ±
of the form q 2c̃(λ ,λ) where λ is a dominant integral weight c̃(λ± , λ) is as in Theorem 6.17d and

λ± runs over the components in the decomposition (6.14) of L(λ) ⊗ V . Different addable boxes
for λ can never have the same content since they cannot be in the same diagonal. Similarly for
two different removable boxes. Let b be an addable box and b′ a removable box for λ. Unless g is
type Dn and b and b′ are in row n, we have c(b), c(b′ ) ≥ −n − 1. Thus, when g is not of type Dn ,
c(b) 6= −c(b′ ) − y and so the two eigenvalues coming from these boxes are different.

     Let Z̃k denote the affine Hecke algebra, the cyclotomic Hecke algebra, the affine BMW algebra
or the cyclotomic BMW algebra corresponding to the case of Theorem 6.17 which is being consid-
ered. Then, as in the classical Schur-Weyl duality setting, Theorem 6.18 implies that as (Uh g, Z̃k )
bimodules                                         M
                                  L(µ) ⊗ V ⊗k ∼ =     L(λ) ⊗ Lλ/µ ,                          (6.19)
                                                     λ

where L(λ) is the irreducible Uh g-module of highest weight λ and Lλ/µ is the irreducible Z̃k module
defined by 4.1.
      The irreducible Z̃k modules Lλ/µ appearing in (6.19) can be constructed quite explicitly. All
the necessary computations for doing this have already been done in [LR, §4 and 5] which does
the case µ = 0. All the arguments in [LR, §4 and 5] generalize directly to the case when µ is an
arbitrary dominant integral weight. The final result is Theorem 6.20 below. The result in part (a)
of Theorem 6.20 is due to Cherednik [Ch].
      If λ and µ are partitions such that λ ⊇ µ the skew shape λ/µ is the configuration of boxes of
in λ which are not in µ. Let λ/µ be a skew shape with k boxes. A standard tableau of shape λ/µ
is a filling T of the boxes of λ/µ with 1, 2, . . . , k such that
       (a) the rows of T are increasing (left to right), and
      (b) the columns of T are increasing (top to bottom).
For example,
                                                           3 4 9 12

is a standard tableau of shape λ/µ = (977421)/(5443).
     For any two partitions µ and λ an up down tableau of length k from µ to λ is a sequence of
partitions T = µ = τ (0) , τ (1) , . . . , τ (k−1) , τ (k) = λ such that

     (a) τ (i) ⊇ τ (i−1) and τ (i) /τ (i−1) =   ,   or    (b) τ (i−1) ⊇ τ (i) and τ (i−1) /τ (i) =   ,

and, in type Bn the situtation τ (i−1) = τ (i) with ℓ(τ (i−1) ) = n is also allowed. Note that a standard
tableau λ/µ with k boxes is exactly an up down tableau of length k from µ to λ where all steps in
the sequence satisfy condition (a).

Markov traces on affine and cyclotomic Hecke and BMW algebras

     If M = L(µ) where µ is a dominant integral weight and V = L(ω1 ) then each of the represen-
tations Φk : Z̃k → EndUh g (M ⊗ V ⊗k ) (where Z̃k is the affine Hecke algebra, the cyclotomic Hecke
algebra, the affine BMW algebra, or the cyclotomic BMW algebra) gives rise to a Markov trace
via Theorem 5.4. The parameters and the weights of these Markov traces are given by Theorems
5.4 and 5.11.
     In type A case λ/µ is a skew shape with k boxes and the parameters and the weights of (most
of) these traces have been given in terms of partitions in [GIM]. In [GIM], µ is a partition of a
special form ([GIM, 2.2(*)]) and so, in their case, the skew shape λ/µ can be viewed as an r-tuple
of partitions. Their formulas can be recovered from ours by rewriting the quantum dimension
dimq (L(λ)) from (5.3) in terms of the partition as in [Mac, I §3 Ex. 1]:

                                           Y [n + 1 + c(b)]
                       dimq (L(λ)) =                        ,   in the type An case,               (6.21)
                                                 [h(b)]
                                           b∈λ


where, if b is the box in position (i, j) of λ, then h(b) = λi − i + λ′j − j + 1 is the hook length at
b, and [d] = (q d − q −d )/(q − q −1 ) for a positive integer d. Thus, the first formula in [GIM, §2.3]
coincides with dimq (L(λ))/(dimq (V ))|λ| and so the formula for the weights of the Markov trace on
cyclotomic Hecke algebras which is given in [GIM, Prop. 2.3] coincides exactly with the formula in
Theorem 5.11. From Theorem 5.4, (6.14) and (6.16) it follows that the parameters of the Markov
trace are z = q/[n + 1] and

where, in the last expression, the first product is over boxes b′ ∈ µ which are in the same row as
the added box µ+ /µ and the second product is over b′′ ∈ µ which are in the same column as µ+ /µ.
Then cancellation of the common terms in the numerator and denominators of each product yields
the combinatorial formulas for the parameters of the Markov traces on cyclotomic Hecke algebras
which are given in [GIM, Thm. 2.4].
     Lambropoulou [Lb, §4] has proved that there is a unique Markov trace on the affine Hecke
algebra with a given choice of parameters z, Q1 , . . . , Qr ∈ C. A similar result is true for the affine
BMW algebra.

Theorem 6.22. For each fixed choice of parameters q, z and Q1 , Q2 , . . . there is a unique Markov
trace on the affine BMW algebra Zk .

Sketch of proof. Consider the image of an affine braid b in the affine BMW algebra. The Markov
trace of this braid can be viewed pictorially as the closure of the braid b.

Standard and simple modules for affine Hecke algebras
        The original construction of the irreducible representations of the affine Hecke algebra of type
A is due to Zelevinsky [Ze2] and is an analogue of the Langlands construction of admissible repre-
sentations of real reductive Lie groups. Zelevinsky used the combinatorics of multisegments which
is easily seen to be equivalent to the combinatorics of unipotent-semisimple pairs used later in
[KL] (see [Ar]). Here we show how the construction of affine Hecke algebra representations via the
functors Fλ naturally matches up with Zelevinsky’s indexings by multisegments. Using the multi-
segment indexing of representations, Theorem 6.31 below explicitly matches up the decomposition
numbers for affine Hecke algebras with Kazdhan-Lusztig polynomials. Recall that the functor Fλ
gives representations of the affine Hecke algebra in the setting of Theorem 6.17a when g is of type
An and V = L(ω1 ) is the n-dimensional fundamental representation.
        Consider an (infinite) sheet of graph paper which has its diagonals labeled consecutively by
. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .. The content c(b) of a box b on this sheet of graph paper is

                              c(b) = the diagonal number of the box b

(a natural generalization of the definition of c(b) in (6.15)). A multisegment is a collection of rows
of boxes (segments) placed on graph paper. We can label this multisegment by a pair of weights
λ = λε1 + · · · λn εn and µ = µ1 ε1 + · · · + µn εn by setting

                      (λ + ρ)i = content of the last box in row i,      and
                      (µ + ρ)i = (content of the first box in row i) − 1.

For example

              3 4 5 6 7
                3 4 5 6 7
                      5 6 7                                    λ = (7, 7, 7, 5, 5) and
                                          corresponds to                                         (6.24)
                1 2 3 4 5                                      µ = (2, 2, 4, 0, 2)
                      3 4 5

(the numbers in the boxes in the picture are the contents of the boxes). The construction forces
the condition
     (a) (λ + ρ)i − (µ + ρ)i ∈ Z≥0 .
and since we want to consider unordered collections of boxes it is natural to take the following
pseudo-lexicographic ordering on the segments
     (b) (λ + ρ)i ≥ (λ + ρ)i+1 ,
     (c) (µ + ρ)i ≤ (µ + ρ)i+1 if (λ + ρ)i = (λ + ρ)i+1 ,
when we denote the multisegment λ/µ by a pair of weights λ, µ. In terms of weights the conditions
(a), (b) and (c) can be restated as (note that in this case both λ and µ are integral)
    (a′ ) λ − µ is a weight of V ⊗k , where k is the number of boxes in λ/µ,
    (b′ ) λ is integrally dominant,
    (c′ ) µ = w ◦ ν with ν integrally dominant and w maximal length in the coset Wλ+ρ wWν+ρ ,
These conditions on the pair of weights (λ, µ) arose previously in Proposition 4.3d and Lemma 4.7.

    Let λ/µ be a multisegment with k boxes and number the boxes of λ/µ from left to right (like
a book). Define

     H̃λ/µ = subalgebra of H̃k generated by {X λ , Tj | λ ∈ L, boxj is not at the end of its row},

so that H̃λ/µ is the “parabolic” subalgebra of H̃k corresponding to the multisegment λ/µ. Define
a one-dimensional H̃λ/µ module Cλ/µ = Cvλ/µ by setting

                          X εi vλ/µ = q 2c(boxi ) vλ/µ ,    and         Tj vλ/µ = qvλ/µ ,                (6.25)

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and j such that boxj is not at the end of its row.
     Let g be of type An and let Fλ be the functor HomUh g (M (λ), · ⊗ V ⊗k ) from the setting of
Theorem 6.17a, where V = L(ω1 ). The standard module for the affine Hecke algebra H̃k is

                                               Mλ/µ = Fλ (M (µ))                                         (6.26)

as defined in (4.1). It follows from the above discussion that these modules are naturally indexed
by multisegments λ/µ. The following proposition shows that this standard module coincides with
the usual standard module for the affine Hecke algebra as considered by Zelevinsky [Ze2] (see also
[Ar], [CG] and [KL]).

Proposition 6.27. Let λ and µ be integrally dominant weights giving rise to the multisegment
λ/µ. Let Cλ/µ be the one dimensional representation of the parabolic subalgebra H̃λ/µ of the affine
Hecke algebra H̃k defined in (6.25). Then

                                             Mλ/µ ∼    H̃
                                                  = IndH̃k (Cλ/µ ).
                                                            λ/µ




Proof. By Proposition 4.3a, Mλ/µ ∼ = (V ⊗k )λ−µ as a vector space. Let {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } be the
standard basis of V = L(ω1 ) with wt(vi ) = εi . If we let the symmetric group Sk act on V ⊗k by
permuting the tensor factors then

      (V ⊗k )λ−µ = span-{π · v⊗(λ−µ) | π ∈ Sk } = span-{π · v⊗(λ−µ) | π ∈ Sk /Sλ−µ },               where

      v⊗(λ−µ) = v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn         and     Sλ−µ = Sλ1 −µ1 × · · · × Sλn −µn
                |     {z      }           |    {z       }
                      λ1 −µ1                   λn −µn

is the parabolic subgroup of Sk which stabilizes the vector v⊗(λ−µ) ∈ V ⊗k . This shows that, as
vector spaces,
                   Mλ/µ ∼      H̃
                         = IndH̃k (Cλ/µ ) = span-{Tπ ⊗ vλ/µ | π ∈ Sk /Sλ−µ }              (6.28)
                                       λ/µ


are isomorphic.
     For notational purposes let

                                bλ/µ = vµ+ ⊗ v⊗(λ−µ) = vµ+ ⊗ vi1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vik

and let b̄λ/µ be the image of bλ/µ in (M ⊗ V ⊗k )[λ] . Since λ is integrally dominant and b̄λ/µ has
weight λ it must be a highest weight vector. We will show that X εℓ acts on b̄λ/µ by the constant

                                                                                                                      j≤ℓ


and pr i acts as the identity on the last k − i factors of M (µ) ⊗ V ⊗k . Then

                                          b̄λ/µ = pr k pr k−1 . . . pr 1 bλ/µ ,

and for each 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ k, prℓ−1 · · · pr1 (bλ/µ ) is a highest weight vector of weight λ(ℓ) in M ⊗ V ⊗ℓ . It
is the “highest” highest weight vector of
                                                                     (ℓ−1)                  (ℓ)
                                     ((M (µ) ⊗ V ⊗(ℓ−1) )[λ                  ]
                                                                                 ⊗ V )[λ          ]
                                                                                                                                   (6.29)

with respect to the ordering in Lemma 4.2 and thus it is deepest in the filtration constructed there.
                                                                                           (ℓ) (ℓ)
Note that the quantum Casimir element acts on the space in (6.29) as the constant q hλ ,λ +2ρi
times a unipotent transformation, and the unipotent transformation must preserve the filtration
coming from Lemma 4.2. Since pr ℓ (bλ /µ) is the highest weight vector of the smallest submodule of
this filtration (which is isomorphic to a Verma module by Lemma 4.2b) it is an eigenvector for the
action of the quantum Casimir. Thus, by (2.11) and (2.13), X εℓ acts on pr ℓ (bλ/µ ) by the constant

                            (ℓ)
                                  ,λ(ℓ) +2ρi−hλ(ℓ−1) ,λ(ℓ−1) +2ρi−hω1 ,ω1 +2ρi
                         q hλ                                                               = q c(boxℓ ) .

Since X εℓ commutes with prj for j > ℓ it this also specifies the action of X εℓ on b̄λ/µ = pr ℓ (bλ/µ ).
    The explicit R-matrix ŘV V : V ⊗ V → V ⊗ V for this case (g of type A and V = L(ω1 )) is well
known (see, for example, the proof of [LR, Prop. 4.4]) and given by
                                        
                                         vj ⊗ vi ,                                                   if i > j,
                      ŘV V (vi ⊗ vj ) = (q − q −1 )vi ⊗ vj + vj ⊗ vi ,                               if i < j,
                                        
                                          qvi ⊗ vj ,                                                  if i = j.

Since Ti acts by ŘV V on the ith and (i + 1)st tensor factors of V ⊗k and commutes with the
projection prλ it follows that Tj (b̄λ/µ ) = q b̄λ/µ , if boxj is not a box at the end of a row of λ/µ.
This analysis of the action of H̃λ/µ on b̄λ/µ shows that there is an H̃k -homomorphism

                                         IndH̃
                                            H̃
                                               k
                                                 (Cvλ/µ )            −→          Mλ/µ
                                               λ/µ

                                                vλ/µ                 7−→          b̄λ/µ .

This map is surjective since Mλ/µ is generated by b̄λ/µ (the Bk action on vλ−µ generates all of
(V ⊗k )λ−µ ). Finally, (6.28) guarantees that it is an isomorphism.

    In the same way that each weight µ ∈ h∗ has a normal form

                                                  µ̃ integrally dominant, and
                  µ = w ◦ µ̃,         with
                                                  w maximal length in the coset wWµ̃+ρ ,
36                                         rosa orellana and arun ram

every multisegment λ/µ has a normal form

                                                       ν the sequence of contents of boxes of λ/µ,
              λ/µ = ν/(w ◦ ν̃),            with        ν̃ = ν − (1, 1, . . . , 1), and
                                                       w maximal length in Wν+ρ wWν+ρ .

The element w in the normal form ν/(w ◦ ν̃) of λ/µ can be constructed combinatorially by the
following scheme. We number (order) the boxes of λ/µ in two different ways.
First ordering: To each box b of λ/µ associate the following triple
                                                                                       
              content of the box to the left of b, −(content of b), −(row number of b)

where, if a box is the leftmost box in a row “the box to its left” is the rightmost box in the same
row. The lexicographic ordering on these triples induces an ordering on the boxes of λ/µ.
Second ordering: To each box b of λ/µ associate the following pair
                                                                                
                     content of b, −(the number of box b in the first ordering)

The lexicographic ordering of these pairs induces a second ordering on the boxes of λ/µ.
Then w is the permutation defined by these two numberings of the boxes. For example, for the
multisegment λ/µ displayed in (6.24) the numberings of the boxes are given by

                     21 6 10 13 18                                      3 7 12 16 19

                     first ordering of boxes                           second ordering of boxes

and the normal form of λ/µ is

ν = (7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1),

Let g be of type An and V = L(ω1 ) and let

                                                    Lλ/µ = Fλ (L(µ)),                                     (6.30)

as defined in (4.1). It is known (a consequence of Proposition 6.27 and Proposition 4.3c) that
Lλ/µ is always a simple H̃k -module or 0. Furthermore, all simple H̃k modules are obtained by this
construction. See [Su] for proofs of these statements. The following theorem is a reformulation of
Proposition 4.12 in terms of the combinatorics of our present setting.

Theorem 6.31. Let λ/µ and ρ/τ be multisegments with k boxes (with µ and τ assumed to be
integral) and let
                     λ/µ = ν/(w ◦ ν̃)    and    ρ/τ = γ/(v ◦ γ̃)

  be their normal forms. Then the multiplicities of Lρ/τ in a Jantzen filtration of Mλ/µ are given
  by

                                                                
                                                                  Pwv (v), if ν = γ,
                                      ρ/τ       (ℓ(y)−ℓ(w)+j)
                                    :L      v 2               =
                      (M )λ/µ (j+1)                               0,       if ν 6= γ,
                  j≥0

  where Pwv (v) is the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial for the symmetric group Sk .

       Theorem 6.31 says that every decomposition number for affine Hecke algebra representations
  is a Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial. The following is a converse statement which says that every
  Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial for the symmetric group is a decomposition number for affine Hecke
  algebra representations. This statement is interesting in that Polo [Po] has shown that every
  polynomial in 1 + vZ≥0 [v] is a Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial for some choice of n and permutations
  v, w ∈ Sn . Thus, the following theorem also shows that every polynomial arises as a generalized
  decomposition number for an appropriate pair of affine Hecke algebra modules.

  Proposition 6.32. Let λ = (r, r, . . . , r) = (r r ) and µ = (0, 0, . . . , 0) = (0r ). Then, each pair of
  permutations v, w ∈ Sr , the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial Pvw (v) for the symmetric group Sr is
  equal to
                                X  (Mλ/w◦µ )(j)                  
                                                                      1
                                                            λ/v◦µ
                      Pvw (v) =             λ/w◦µ   (j+1)
                                                          :L        v 2 (ℓ(y)−ℓ(w)+j).
                                j≥0
                                     (M           )

  Proof. Since µ + ρ and λ + ρ are both regular, Wλ+ρ = Wµ+ρ = 1 and the standard and irreducible
  modules Lλ/(w◦µ) and Mλ/(v◦µ) ranging over all v, w ∈ Sk . Thus, this statement is a corollary of
  Proposition 4.12.
