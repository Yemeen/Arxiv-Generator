                                             The purpose of this text is to add (at least conjecturally) some more items to
                                             the list of analogies between the category H of Harish-Chandra modules and the
                                             category O of Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand which has been established by Bernstein-
                                             Gelfand-Gelfand, Vogan, Beilinson, Ginzburg, Soergel and others. These analogies
                                             have been suggested by confronting some observations about p-integrable harmonic
                                             forms on real hyperbolic space with results of the people mentioned above about
                                             the category O. To the reader more familiar with Lp harmonic forms than with
                                             the category O my advice is to read in parallel Parts A and B of section 1 (Part B

                                             being a detailed example).

                                                         Part A. The Weak Alexandru Conjecture

                                             (1.1) Setting.
                                                   G is a connected semisimple Lie group G with finite center,
                                                   K ⊂ G is a maximal compact subgroup,
                                                   g ⊃ k are the complexified Lie algebras of G and K,
                                                   b ⊂ g is a Borel subalgebra,
                                                   h a Cartan subalgebra of g contained in b.

                                             For any pair m ⊂ l of (complex) Lie algebras and any l-module V , say that
                                             V is m-finite if it is a sum of finite dimensional sub-m-modules, and that

                                                                                       1
V is an (l, m)-module if it is m-finite and m-semisimple. The category O of
BGG-modules is the full subcategory of g-mod whose objects are the b-finite
(g, h)-modules of finite length ; whereas the category H of Harish-Chandra mod-
ules is the full subcategory of g-mod whose objects are those (g, k)-modules of finite
length V such that for any finite dimensional k-invariant subspace F ⊂ V the ac-
tion of k on F exponentiates to K. The categories O and H are C-categories in the
sense of Bass [B] page 57.


  For any C-category C let

                                           I = I(C)


be the set of isomorphism classes of simple objects of C [assume it is a set], for each
i ∈ I choose a representative

                                             Li ∈ i


and let

                                              ℓ(i)


be the projective dimension of Li [i.e. the supremum in Z ∪ {+∞} of the set
{n ∈ Z | Extn (Li , −) 6= 0}].


(1.2) Definition. The C-ordering is the smallest partial ordering ≤ on I
       satisfying
                                                         

(1.3) Definition. The subcategory generated by the subset J of I is the full

      sub-C-category hJ iC of C characterized by the condition that an object V of
      C belongs to hJ iC iff each simple subquotient of V is isomorphic to Lj for
      some j ∈ J .


(1.4) Definition. If C is a C-category and B a full sub-C-category, say that B is
      Ext-full in C if for all V, W ∈ B the natural morphism


                                Ext•B (V, W ) → Ext•C (V, W )


      is an isomorphism.


  [If all objects of B have finite length it suffices to check the above isomorphism

for V and W simple (because of the long exact sequences and the five-lemma).]
Recall that a subset J of I is an initial segment iff

                                        
                               i, j ∈ I 

                                 i≤j

(1.5) Definition. In the above notation C is a Guichardet category if the
      subcategory generated by any initial segment is Ext-full in C.


  Let Setting (1.1) be in force, denote by I the annihilator of the trivial module in
the center of U (g) and for any sub-C-category C of g-mod let

                                          Cρ

be the full sub-C-category of C whose objects are annihilated by some power of I.


(1.6) Weak Alexandru Conjecture. The category Hρ is a Guichardet category.

                                          3
  Part (a) of the theorem below is due to Cline, Parshall and Scott, and part (b) to
Fuser.

(1.7) Theorem.

         (a) The category Oρ is a Guichardet category,

         (b) the Weak Alexandru Conjecture holds for Hρ with G = SL(3, R),

             Spin(n, 1) or SU (n, 1).

  The next item on the agenda is the Strong Alexandru Conjecture (SAC). Hoping
to make it more digest I first give a set of statements of a somewhat geometric
flavor which imply the SAC for Spin(2n + 1, 1) ; more precisely the setting of the
SAC is dual to the one described here. I’ll use horizontal lines to set off this part of
the text [which is merely motivational].


                       Part B. A detailed example

Let Ωpk be the space of those p-forms on hyperbolic (2n + 1)-space which are killed

by ∆k and Ωp the union of the Ωpk ; put

                              I := {p ∈ Z | 0 ≤ p ≤ n},

                                        Ω := ⊕ Ωp .
                                            p∈I


As a general notation if V is a vector space, W a vector subspace and ϕ1 , ..., ϕk
endomorphisms of V , set

                                                      k
                                                                   !

                                                   i=1


Let d be the differential and d∗ be the codifferential, and put for p ∈ I

                                   Lp := Ωp (d, d∗ ),

                                             4
                                       Mp := Ωp (d∗ ),

                                    p
                                    Ω (∆, d∗ )     if   p < n,

                                          Ln        if   p = n.

Equip Ωpk with the C 0 -topology and Ωp with the inductive limit topology ; let
G be the group of orientation preserving hyperbolic isometries ; denote by C the
category defined by the rule that an object of C is a topological G-module V which
is isomorphic to a close subspace of some Ωp1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ωpr , and a morphism in C is a
G-equivariant continuous linear map. The following facts are known :


• The category C is a C-category.


• The modules introduced above belong to it ; any simple object of C is isomorphic
  to Lp for a unique p in I.


• The C-ordering on I is opposite to the natural ordering ; the projective dimen-
  sion of Lp is 2n + 1 − p.


• The category Hρ is equivalent to the subcategory of C whose objects have finite
  length, or equivalently are annihilated by some power of ∆.


• This subcategory — which I abusively denote by Hρ for a short while — is

  Ext-full in C and contains M p .


• The objects of C have injective hulls and therefore minimal injective resolutions.


[In this parenthesis I give a reminder of what’s meant here by minimal resolution
and offer to the reader unfamiliar with homological algebra a cheap definition of
Ext-groups in this context. Given V in C there are elements p1 , ..., pk of I and

                                               5
an isomorphism from the socle of V onto ⊕ki=1 Lpi ; this isomorphism extends to

an embedding ϕ : V ֌ I 0 := ⊕ki=1 Ωpi (this statement is sometimes called

Frobenius reciprocity). Since the cokernel of ϕ is again in C this process can be

iterated, giving rise to an injective resolution V ֌ I 0 → I 1 → · · ·, which is
clearly minimal. Moreover for each pair of integers (j, p) with j ≥ 0 and p ∈ I

there is a finite dimensional vector space Extj (Lp , V ) acted on trivially by G such

that I j ≃ ⊕p∈I Extj (Lp , V ) ⊗C Ωp .]

• The injective hull of Lp is Ωp .


• The vector spaces Ext• (V, W ) are finite dimensional for V, W ∈ C.

  Let me digress a tiny bit by stating the Weak Alexandru Conjecture in this
setup. During this parenthetical comment p shall be a fixed “number” satisfying
1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ [not an element of I]. Let K be the stabilizer in G of a given
point of hyperbolic space, say that an object V of Hρ is p-integrable if its K-finite
vectors are, and let Lp be the full subcategory of p-integrable objects of Hρ ;

then Lp is Ext-full in Hρ [more precisely a subcategory of Hρ is generated by an
initial segment iff it is of the form Lp — the number p being of course in general
nonunique.]


  Going back to the SAC, for q ∈ I consider the filtration F0q := 0 ⊂ F1q := Mq ⊂

F2q := Ωq ; then d∗ induces an isomorphism F2q /F1q ≃ Mq−1 [with the convention

M−1 = 0] ; this filtration is analogous to the filtration of projective modules by
Verma modules in the category O and is encoded in Axiom (1.10) below. If E • is a
graded vector space let E • (t) be its Poincar series. Define the I by I matrix a with

entries in Z[t] by

                                 apq = Ext• (Lp , Mq )(t).

To compute this series note that the augmented complex

The corresponding theorem in the realm of the category O is due to Beilinson,
Ginzburg and Soergel, and the above formula suggests Axiom (1.16) below. Finally

let’s compute Ext• (Lp , Lq ). To simplify the notation, if n < p ≤ 2n + 1 identify Ωp

to Ω2n+1−p via the star operator, and decree that Ωp = 0 for p < 0 or p > 2n + 1.

               Part C. The Strong Alexandru Conjecture

Here are some preliminaries to state the Strong Alexandru Conjecture. Set


                                        Z := C[[z1 , ..., zm ]],

                                                      8
[where z1 , ..., zm are indeterminates] and let A be a Z-algebra which is finitely
generated over Z. Then there is a semisimple subalgebra A0 of A satisfying
A = A0 ⊕ rad(A). Assume there is a finite set F such that A0 can — and will —

be identified to the algebra CF of functions on F . For each i ∈ F define ei ∈ A0 by
ei (j) = δij [Kronecker delta]. As a general notation put

               A-fd := the category of finite dimensional A-modules.

I’ll make free use of the facts that by a theorem of Casselman A-fd is Ext-full in
A-mod and that by a result of BGG the categories Oρ and Hρ are equivalent to
A-fd for some algebra A as above — the C-algebra isomorphism class of A being
unique. It will be tacitly assumed that the category C of interest has been set to
be Oρ or Hρ , and that an algebra A as above and an equivalence C ∼ A-fd have
been chosen, providing in particular an identification I = F ; the symbol Li denotes
at the same time an object of C and “the” corresponding object in A-fd ; more
generally I’ll allow myself to navigate rather freely between C and A-fd. Fix a
family M = (Mi )i∈I of A-modules.


(1.8) Definition. An M -filtration F• of an A-module V is a sequence

  The proposition below is essentially due to Cline, Parshall and Scott ; an
elementary proof is given in section 1 [recall that A-fd is the category of finite
dimensional A-modules].


(1.19) Proposition. In the above setting if Conditions (1.9)—(1.12) are satisfied
       then A-fd is a Guichardet category.


(1.20) Definitions. If A satisfies Conditions (1.9)—(1.18) above, then A is a
       BGG algebra. A beegeegee is a category which is equivalent to A-fd for
       some BBG algebra A.


  The theorem below is due to BGG (see [BGG]), Beilinson and Ginzburg (see

[BGS]) and Cline-Parshall-Scott (see statements (3.3.c), (3.5.a) and (3.9.a) in
[CPS]).


(1.21) Theorem. The category Oρ is a beegeegee.


(1.22) Strong Alexandru Conjecture. The category Hρ is a beegeegee.


(1.23) Theorem (Fuser). The above conjecture holds for Spin(n, 1), SU (n, 1) and
       SL(3, R).


  The drawback [at least one of them] of all this stuff is that it’s almost never
computable ! Here is a statement which, although as conjectural as the previous
ones, can be submitted to numerical tests. It consists in a computable variant of
[a particular case of] Condition (1.18), that is in a formula which would express,

when g and k have the same rank, the Poincar series Ext•A (A0 , A0 )(t) in terms
of computable things. In the Langlands classification Li occurs as the unique
simple quotient of a module induced from some parabolic subgroup Pi ; let

                                           12
pi = mi ⊕ ai ⊕ ni be a Langlands decomposition of C ⊗R Lie(Pi ) ; put

                                                  dim ai
                                  dei := 1 − t2             ;


    e be the dimension of the KC -orbit attached to i and (e
let ℓ(i)                                                   pij ) the family of

Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials, that is the one denoted (Pγ,δ ) in [V3],
section 6 ; and set

                              aij (t) = te
                              e          ℓ(j)−e

                                                   peij (t−2 ) .

(1.24) Conjecture. If g and k have the same rank then


                                                       a de e
                               Ext•A (A0 , A0 )(t) = t e    a.

  For a given group G one can run the following numerical test.


              a de e
(a) Compute t e    a;

(b) look if this is compatible with what’s known of Ext•A (A0 , A0 )(t) [in particular

    with the (g, K)-cohomology, as computed by Vogan’s Uα -algorithm] ;
(c) pretend Conjecture (1.24) holds and use it to compute the Hρ -ordering ;

(d) check if there are matrices a and d such that a is upper triangular with ones on

                                                        a de e
    the diagonal, d is diagonal and we have t a d a = t e    a.

  If the test is successful no conclusion can be drawn ; if it fails then at least one
of the involved conjectures is wrong. — In the real rank one case evidence suggests
that the classical objects “with tildes” coincide with the nonclassical ones [“without
tildes”] ; in the case of P Sp(2, R) using results of Vogan [V], pp 251-255, one sees
such is not the case — but the test is still successful. I think that in the case where
the complex ranks of g and k are different there is a similar formula with e
                                                                           a as above

and de a certain polynomial valued diagonal matrix.

            1. Proof of Proposition (1.19)

In the setting of Proposition (1.19) assume there are at least two elements

in I [otherwise there is nothing to prove], and consider the following setting

                            i is a maximal element of I,

                                       e := ei ,

                                      I := AeA,

                                      B := A/I,

                                    J := I \ {i}.

Proposition (1.19) follows from Lemma (2.1) below, which will be proved at the end
of the section.

(2.1) Lemma.

        (a) The category B-mod is Ext-full in A-mod,

        (b) The C-ordering coincides on J with the hJ iC -ordering [see (1.2) and
            (1.3)],

        (c) B satisfies Conditions (1.9)—(1.12).


(2.2) Lemma. If j 6= i then Mj ∈ B-fd.


Proof of Lemma (2.2). The statement is an immediate consequence of the
following observation. For any pair (K, k) with j ∈ K ⊂ I put

                                             .X
                           P (K, k) := Aek            A eℓ A ek .
                                               ℓ6∈K


                                          14
Then P (K, k) is a projective cover of Lk in hKiA-fd. If k ∈ L ⊂ K ⊂ I and P (K, k)

is in hLiA-fd then P (K, k) = P (L, ℓ). QED

  The following lemma is obvious.

(2.3) Lemma. The three conditions (a) j is maximal,

                                      (b) Mj = Aej ,

                                      (c) Mj is projective

      are equivalent. In particular Mi = Aei is projective. QED

  Let E be the class of those A-modules which are isomorphic to a direct sum of
finitely many copies of Aei .

(2.4) Lemma. Let V be an M -filtrable A-module. Then there is an M -filtration
      F• of V and a nonnegative integer n such that Fn ∈ E and e(V /Fn ) = 0.

Proof. The statement results from the fact easy to check that eMj = 0 for all j 6= i
and from the observation that each occurrence of a projective into a given module
as a subquotient is in fact an occurrence as a submodule. QED


  In particular the above lemma provides for each j ∈ I an M -filtration F•j

of Aej by left subideals and a nonnegative integer nj such that Fnjj ∈ E and

e(Aej /Fnjj ) = 0. Put

                                    J := ⊕ Fnjj ;
                                           j


then there is a positive integer n such that J is isomorphic to the direct sum of n
copies of Aei ; write this direct sum in the nonsensical form ⊕nj=1 Aei ; choose an

isomorphism
                                      n         ∼
                                  ϕ : ⊕ Aei → J ;
                                     j=1


                                           15
and set
                                         Ai := EndA Ae,

                                        C := eAe = (Ai )op .

We may — and will — view any left module over Ai as a right module over C. Put


                                             ⊗ := ⊗ .
                                                      C



(2.5) Lemma.

          (a) For j 6= i the multiplication map Ae ⊗ eAej → Aej is an isomorphism,

          (b) the natural map Ae ⊗ eA → A is one-to-one,

          (c) we have J = I and Fnjj = Iej . In particular Bej := Aej /Iej = Aej /Fnjj

             is M -filtrable.

Proof. To prove (a) set f := e − ej and note that the canonical isomorphism
Ae ⊗ eAe → Ae is the direct sum of the multiplication maps Ae ⊗ eAej → Aej

and Ae ⊗ eAf → Af . To check (b) consider the diagram

where α1 , ..., α5 are defined as follows


              α1 is the multiplication map,
              α2 is the identity [indeed e(A/J) = 0 =⇒ eA = eJ],

              α3 is 1 ⊗ ϕ−1 ,
              α4 is the canonical map,
              α5 is the multiplication map.


The maps α2 , α3 and α4 are clearly isomorphisms and by (a) so is α5 , whereas ϕ
is one-to-one. Since the diagram commutes α1 is one-to-one and (b) is verified. To
prove (c) observe I = Im α1 = Im ϕ = J. QED


(2.6) Lemma. Let A be an algebra and e an element of A satisfying e2 = e 6= 1.

      Put I := AeA, B := A/I and C := eAe, let V and W be B-modules, and
      consider the following conditions

        (a) the natural map Ae ⊗C eA → I ⊂ A is one-to-one and Ae is right C-flat,

        (b) I is right A-flat,

        (c) TorA
               q (B, V ) = 0 for all q > 0,


        (d) ExtnB (V, W ) ≃ ExtnA (V, W ) for all n (natural isomorphism).

      Then (a) =⇒ (b) =⇒ (c) =⇒ (d).


Proof. The implication (a) =⇒ (b) is clear. The implication (b) =⇒ (c) follows
from the long (?) exact sequence obtained by applying “− ⊗A V ” to the short exact
sequence I ֌ A ։ B. The implication (c) =⇒ (d) follows from Proposition
VI.4.1.3 of Cartan-Eilenberg [CE]. QED


Proof of Lemma (2.1). Part (a) [the Ext-fullness of B-mod in A-mod] follows

                                              17
from Lemma (2.6). In view of Condition (1.12) [about projective dimensions]

part (b) [the coincidence of the orderings] results from (a). Let me prove part (c),
claiming that B satisfies Conditions (1.9)—(1.12). Condition (1.9) [the coincidence
of the Verma modules] and Condition (1.11) [the (EndB Mi )-flatness of Mi ] are
consequences of part (b) and Lemma (2.2) [Mj ∈ B-mod] ; Condition (1.10) [the

M -filtrability] follows from (2.5.c) ; Condition (1.12) results from (a). QED
