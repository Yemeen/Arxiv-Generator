                                                                                            Abstract
                                                   This paper deals with the analytic continuation of holomorphic automorphic forms on a
                                             (Hermitian) Lie group G. We prove that for any discrete subgroup Γ of G there always exists a
                                             non-trivial holomorphic automorphic form, i.e., there exists a Γ-spherical unitary highest weight
                                             representation of G. Holomorphic automorphic forms have the property that they analytically
                                             extend to holomorphic functions on a complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup S ⊆ GC . As an application
                                             we prove that the bounded holomorphic functions on Γ\S ⊆ Γ\GC separate the points.



                                                                                        Introduction
                                                    Let G be a connected Lie group sitting in its complexification GC . Let Γ < G be any
                                             discrete subgroup. Then Γ acts freely and properly discontinuously on GC and the quotient
                                             Γ\GC is a complex manifold. It is reasonable to ask which such homogeneous complex manifolds
                                             are Stein. If G is nilpotent, then Γ\GC is Stein by a theorem of Gilligan and Huckleberry (cf.
                                             [GiHu78]). We call a Lie algebra g weakly elliptic, if all operators ad(X), X ∈ g, have imaginary
                                             spectrum and note that all nilpotent and many solvable Lie algebras are weakly elliptic. Then
                                             Loeb has shown in [Lo84] that Γ\GC is Stein whenever the Lie algebra g of G is weakly elliptic.
                                             But if G is semisimple and Γ is a lattice, then a theorem of Barth and Otte (cf. [BaOt73])
                                             implies that the only holomorphic functions on Γ\GC are the constants; in particular Γ\GC is
                                             not Stein. Therefore in general the G × G-biinvariant complex manifold GC is too large for
                                             Γ\GC carrying a rich complex structure. In this paper we will identify an open G × G-invariant
                                             Stein domain S ⊆ GC for which we prove that there is a rich supply of automorphic forms on
                                             Γ\G which holomorphically extend to Γ\S . In an important example we will prove that Γ\S is
                                             Stein.
                                                    Let us illustrate the situation for the example G = SU(p, q). Then G can be defined as
                                             the invariance group of a hermitian form h·, ·ip,q on Cn , n = p + q , and we have GC = Sl(n, C).
                                             The contraction semigroup of the form h·, ·ip,q
                                                                 S: = {g ∈ GC : hg.v, g.vip,q < hv, vip,q for all v ∈ Cn , v 6= 0}
                                             is easily seen to be an open G × G-invariant domain in GC , a so-called complex Ol’shanskiı̆
                                             semigroup. In general one can define complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups for every connected Lie

group, whenever its Lie algebra admits an open convex weakly elliptic Ad(G)-invariant cone
Ø 6= W ⊆ g. If g is simple, this means that g is either hermitian or compact, but we also have
many non-reductive examples as the Jacobi-algebra hn ⋊sp(n, R) with hn the 2n+1 -dimensional
Heisenberg algebra (cf. [Ne99a] and Example 1.3 below). The complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup
associated to G and W is given by S = G Exp(iW ).
       In [Ne98, Ne99b] Neeb settled a conjecture of Gindikin by showing that all complex
Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups and their symmetric space analogues are Stein manifolds. Let now Γ < G
be any discrete subgroup. In this paper we investigate the quotients Γ\S . These manifolds were
first considered by the first author for G = Sl(2, R) in the context of Hardy spaces on Γ\S (cf.
[Ach99]).
       Let us in the following assume that Ad(G) is closed in Aut(g) and that W is pointed,
which both are very natural assumptions in our context. Then one of our main results is:
Theorem A. (cf. 4.7) If Γ < G is a discrete subgroup of G, then:
  (i) Hol(Γ\S) separates the points of Γ\S .
 (ii) If Γ < G is cocompact, then the bounded holomorphic functions on Γ\S separate the points.
In particular, the Caratheodory semimetric on Γ\S is a metric.
      We construct holomorphic functions on Γ\S with techniques from representation theory.
      Let t ⊆ g denote a compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra of g. If (πλ , Hλ ) is a unitary
highest weight representation of G with highest weight λ ∈ it∗ , then one has a holomorphic
extension to a representation of the complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup S which has G as some sort
of Shilov boundary (cf. [Ne99a, Ch. XIV]). We obtain holomorphic functions on Γ\S by taking
matrix-coefficients with Γ-fixed hyperfunction vectors; i.e., we take

                               θv,η : Γ\S → C, Γs 7→ hπλ (s).v, ηi ,

with v ∈ Hλ and η ∈ Hλ−ω a Γ-fixed element. Here Hλ−ω denotes the Fréchet G-module
of hyperfunction vectors of (πλ , Hλ ), the strong antidual of the analytic vectors Hλω . Note
that for v being a highest weight vector the function θv,η is an analytic continuation of the
(anti)holomorphic automorphic form θv,η |G (cf. [Bo66]).
      Our considerations from above show that one gets many holomorphic functions on Γ\S
provided Γ-spherical unitary highest weight representations (πλ , Hλ ) of G do exist. Our central
result is as follows:
Theorem B. (cf. 3.8 - 3.11) Let Γ be an arbitrary discrete subgroup of G and assume that G
has compact center. Denote by Λ ⊆ it∗ the spectrum of the L1 -Bergman space B 1 (S) on S .
Then the following assertions hold:
  (i) For all λ ∈ Λ and v ∈ Hλω the Poincaré series of v
                                                     X
                                          P (v): =         πλ (γ).v
                                                     γ∈Γ


       converges in the module of hyperfunction vectors Hλ−ω to a Γ-fixed element.
 (ii) For all but finitely many λ ∈ Λ we have P (vλ ) 6= 0 , where vλ is a highest weight vector of
(πλ , Hλ ).
      Part (i) is obtained from integral geometric observations in the Bergman space B 1 (S)
together with the Plancherel theorem for B 2 (S) (cf. [Kr98a]).
      To get a feeling for the contents of (ii) we explain it for the example
                                                                              G= SU(1, 1). Write
                                                                         a   b

                                                                         cγ dγ

                                          X
(∗)                         P (vλ )(z): =   (cγ z + dγ )λ        (z ∈ D).
                                           γ∈Γ

Here the parameter −λ ranges in the integers with λ ≥ 3 . The idea for the proof lies in an
analytic continuation of P (vλ ) in the parameter λ together with a clever argument that this
analytic continuation is non-zero.
       Statements related to (ii) were also proved by Siegel (cf. [Fr83]). He considers scalar valued
Poincaré series (this means that the minimal K -type of (πλ , Hλ ) is one-dimensional) and proves
that for a given Γ there always exists a K -finite vector v such that P (v) 6= 0 . Siegel’s proof
relies heavily on the fact that D is a bounded domain while in our approach this is immaterial
(for the Jacobi group D is unbounded). Further our argument does not need that the Poincaré
series is scalar valued. Finally, Siegel’s method does not tell for which K -finite vector v one has
P (v) 6= 0 while our techniques yield P (vλ ) 6= 0 for the distinguished highest weight vectors vλ .
We would also like to mention that (ii) partly solves an open problem posed by Wells and Wolf
(cf. [WeWo79]; see also [WaWo83]).
       In Chapter 4 we show that the analytically continued automorphic functions θv,η vanish
at infinity:
Theorem C. (cf. 4.6) If Γ < G is cocompact and v ∈ Hλω , then we have

                                           lim θv,η (s) = 0.
                                          s→∞
                                          s∈Γ\S




      It is our impression that this result in combination with Theorem A might yield the Stein
property of Γ\S in the cocompact case (cf. Conjecture 5.3 below for a more detailed discussion).
      For G = Sl(2, R) the existence of a non-vanishing holomorphic cusp form (the discriminant)
allows to prove the following:
Theorem D. (cf. 5.1 - 5.2) For G = Sl(2, R) and all subgroups Γ < Sl(2, Z) the quotients Γ\S
are Stein.
      The authors would like to thank Karl-Hermann Neeb for his very useful remarks.



     1. Complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups and their representations
      In this first section we introduce complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups, which may be thought of
as complex Lie subsemigroups of complex Lie groups. Then we recall the basic facts concerning
their holomorphic representations and the characterization of the irreducible ones by highest
weight representations. The concepts will be illustrated with some importnat examples (cf.
Example 1.3 and Remark 1.7).



                               Complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups
      Throughout g denotes a finite dimensional real Lie algebra. The concept of a complex
Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup is closely related to the concept of elliptic elements in a real Lie algebra
g. Recall that an element X ∈ g is called elliptic if ad X is semsimple with purely imaginary
spectrum. Accordingly we call a subset W ⊆ g elliptic if all its elements are elliptic.

Definition 1.1. (Complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups, cf. [Ne99a, Ch. XI]) Let Ø 6= W ⊆ g be an
                                                 e , respectively G
open convex elliptic cone and W its closure. Let G                e C , be the simply connected Lie
groups associated to g, respectively gC , and set G1 : = hexp gi ⊆ G e C . Then Lawson’s Theorem
says that the subset ΓG1 (W ): = G1 exp(iW ) is a closed subsemigroup of G   eC and the polar map

                             G1 × W → ΓG1 (W ), (g, X) 7→ g exp(iX) ,

is a homeomorphism.
       Now the universal covering semigroup ΓG           e
                                               e(W ): = ΓG1 (W ) has a similar structure. We can
lift the exponential function exp: g + iW → ΓG1 (W ) to an exponential mapping Exp: g + iW →
ΓG                                                        e
   e(W ) with Exp(0) = 1 and thus obtain a polar map G × W → ΓG       e(W ), (g, X) 7→ g Exp(iX)
which is a homeomorphism.
       If G is any connected Lie group associated to g, then π1 (G) is a discrete central subgroup
of ΓG e(W ) and we obtain a covering homomorphism ΓG     e(W ) → ΓG (W ): = ΓG  e(W )/π1 (G). It is
easy to see that there is also a polar map G × W → ΓG (W ), (g, X) 7→ g Exp(iX), which is a
homeomorphism. The semigroups of the type ΓG (W ) are called complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups.
       The subset ΓG (W ) ⊆ ΓG (W ) is an open semigroup carrying a complex manifold structure
such that the multiplication is holomorphic. Moreover there is an involution on ΓG (W ) given by
                   ∗
                       : ΓG (W ) → ΓG (W ), s = g Exp(iX) 7→ s∗ = Exp(iX)g −1 ,

being antiholomorphic on ΓG (W ). Thus both ΓG (W ) and ΓG (W ) are involutive semigroups.
       From now on we denote by S an open complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup ΓG (W ) and by S
its “closure” ΓG (W ).
      If l is a subalgebra of a Lie algebra g, then we write Inng (l) ⊆ Aut(g) for the subalgebra
of the automorphism group Aut(g) of g which is generated by the elements ead X , X ∈ l. If
l = g, then we also write Inn(g) instead of Inng (g).
      A subalgebra a ⊆ g is said to be compactly embedded, if Inng (a) is relatively compact in
Aut(g). Note that a subalgebra is compactly embedded if and only if it is elliptic.
      Note that if a real Lie algebra admits a non-empty open elliptic convex cone, then there
exists a compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra t ⊆ g (cf. [Ne99a, Th. VII.1.8]). To step
further we first need some terminology concerning Lie algebras with compactly embedded Cartan
subalgebras.

Definition 1.2. (cf. [Ne99a, Ch. VII]) Let g be a finite dimensional Lie algebra over R with
compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra t .
(a) Associated to the Cartan subalgebra tC in the complexification gC there is a root decompo-
sition as follows. For a linear functional α ∈ t∗C we set

                             gα
                              C : = {X ∈ gC : (∀Y ∈ tC ) [Y, X] = α(Y )X}
                                                                                L
and write ∆: = {α ∈ t∗C \{0}: gα
                               C 6= {0}} for the set of roots. Then gC = tC ⊕
                                                                                       α
                                                                                  α∈∆ gC , α(t) ⊆ iR
                           −α
for all α ∈ ∆, and gα C = gC , where X 7→ X denotes complex conjugation on gC with respect
to g.
(b) Let r denote the radical of g and note that there is a t -invariant Levi decomposition g = r⋊s.
Let k be a maximal compactly embedded subalgebra of g containing t . Then a root α is said
to be compact if gα
                  C ⊆ kC and non-compact otherwise. We write ∆k for the set of compact roots
and ∆n for the non-compact ones.
(c) A positive system ∆+ of roots is a subset of ∆ for which there exists a regular element
X0 ∈ it∗ with ∆+ : = {α ∈ ∆: α(X0 ) > 0} . We call a positive system k-adapted if the set
                     Discrete group actions on Stein domains in complex Lie groups                 5

∆+n : = ∆n ∩ ∆
                +
                   is invariant under the Weyl group Wk : = NInng (k) (t)/ZInng (k) (t) acting on t .
Recall that there exists a k-adapted positive system if and only if zg (z(k)) = k. In this case we
say g is quasihermitian. In this case it is easy to see that s is quasihermitian, too, and so all
simple ideals of s are either compact or hermitian.
(d) We associate to ∆+  n the convex cones

                                                                     +
                           Cmin : = cone{i[Xα , Xα ]: Xα ∈ gα
                                                            C , α ∈ ∆n },

and Cmax : = (i∆+    ⋆                   +
                  n ) = {X ∈ t: (∀α ∈ ∆n ) iα(X) ≥ 0} . Note that both Cmin and Cmax are
closed convex cones in t .
(e) Write pt : g → t for the orthogonal projection along [t, g] and set OX : = Inn(g).X for the
adjoint orbit through X ∈ g. We define the minimal and maximal cone associated to ∆+   n by


          Wmin : = {X ∈ g: pt (OX ) ⊆ Cmin }     and Wmax : = {X ∈ g: pt (OX ) ⊆ Cmax }

and note that both cones are convex, closed and Inn(g)-invariant.

Example 1.3. (a) (Hermitian case) Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra with Cartan decomposi-
tion g = k ⊕ p . Then g is called hermitian if g is simple and z(k) 6= {0} . Hermitian Lie algebras
are classified; the complete list is as follows (cf. [Hel78, p. 518]):

                     su(p, q) sp(n, R) so∗ (2n) so(2, n) e6(−14)           e7(−25) .
That g is hermitian implies in particular that there is a compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra
t ⊆ k of g and that z(k) = RX0 is one dimensional (cf. [Hel78, Ch. VIII]). Since X0 is Inng (k)-
fixed, the prescription
                                  ∆+n : = {α ∈ ∆: α(iX0 ) > 0}

defines a k-adapted system of positive non-compact roots. Hermitian Lie algebras admit pointed
convex Inn(g)-invariant closed cones with non-empty elliptic interior. One of them, the minimal
cone, has a quite simple description:

                                       Wmin = Inn(g).R+ X0 .

Its trace with the Cartan algebra t is given by

                                    Cmin = cone{−iα̌: α ∈ ∆+
                                                           n}

where α̌ ∈ it denotes the coroot of α (cf. [HiNe93, Ch. 7] for all that).
(b) (Compact case) (cf. [HiNe93, Ch. 7]) Let k be a compact semisimple Lie algebra and set
g: = k ⊕ R (direct Lie algebra sum). If h·, ·i denotes an Inn(k)-innner product on k, then the
prescription

                               W : = {(X, t) ∈ g: hX, Xi < t2 , t > 0}
defines an open elliptic Inn(g)-invariant convex cone g. The most prominent example herof is
g = u(n) with
                             W : = {X ∈ u(n): iX positive definite}.
On the group level with G = U(n) and GC = Gl(n, C) the Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup associated to
−W is the unit ball in GC :

                           S = G exp(−iW ) = {g ∈ Gl(n, C): kgk < 1}

with kgk the spectral norm.
(c) (Mixed case – The Jacobi algebra) There are interesting examples of Lie algebras admitting
invariant elliptic convex cones which are neither semisimple nor solvable (see Ex. 4.9(b) for a
non-nilpotent solvable example). One of them is the Jacobi algebra
                                 g: = hsp(n, R): = hn ⋊ sp(n, R)
with hn = R ⊕ R2n the (2n + 1)-dimensional Heisenberg algebra. Then z(g) = z(hn ) ∼
                                                                                  = R is one
dimensional and a compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra is given by t = z(g) ⊕ ts with ts a
compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra of sp(n, R). For the Jacobi algebra g the maximal cone
has an easy description, namely

                                  Wmax = R+ ⊕ R2n ⊕ Wmax,s
with Wmax,s a maximal cone in sp(n, R). For more details on the Jacobi algebra we refer to
[KNÓ01, Sect. II] and [Ne99a, p. 400ff, p. 700]. For another mixed example see also Example
4.9(c) below.



                                Holomorphic representations

Definition 1.4.     Let H be a Hilbert space and B(H) the space of bounded operators on it.
A holomorphic representation (π, H) of a complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup S is a non-degenerate
holomorphic semigroup representation π: S → B(H) such that π is a vector-valued holomorphic
map satisfying π(s∗ ) = π(s)∗ for all s ∈ S .
      Now we take a closer look at the irreducible holomorphic representations of S . They are
obtained by analytic continuation of unitary highest weight representations of G.
      From now on we assume that g contains a compactly embedded Cartan subalgebra t ⊆ g
and that there exists a non-empty open elliptic convex cone W ⊆ g. Then in view of [Ne99a,
Th. VII.3.8], there exists a k-adapted positive system ∆+ such that
                                       Wmin ⊆ W ⊆ Wmax
         0
holds, Wmax  is elliptic, Wmin ∩t = Cmin and Wmax ∩t = Cmax . Recall that every elliptic Ad(G)-
invariant cone W ⊆ g can be reconstructed by its intersection with t , i.e., W = Ad(G).C with
C: = W ∩ t .

Definition 1.5. (Highest weight modules, cf. [Ne99a, Ch. X]) Let ∆+ be a positive system.
(a) For a gC -module V and β ∈ t∗C we write V β := {v ∈ V : (∀X ∈ tC )X.v = β(X)v} for the
weight space of weight β and PV = {β: V β 6= {0}} for the set of weights of V .
(b) Let V be a gC -module and v ∈ V λ , v 6= 0 , a tC -weight vector. We say that v is a primitive
element of V (with respect to ∆+ ) if gα                                 +
                                           C .v = {0} holds for all α ∈ ∆ .
(c) A gC -module V is called a highest weight module with highest weight λ (with respect to
∆+ ) if it is generated by a primitive element of weight λ.
(d) Let G be a connected Lie group with Lie algebra g. We write T for the analytic subgroup
of G corresponding to t . Let (π, H) be a unitary representation of G. A vector v ∈ H is called
T -finite if it is contained in a finite dimensional T -invariant subspace. We write HT,ω for the
space of analytic T -finite vectors.
(e) An irreducible unitary representation (π, H) of G is called a highest weight representation
with respect to ∆+ and highest weight λ ∈ it∗ if HT,ω is a highest weight module for gC with
respect to ∆+ and highest weight λ. We write HW (G, ∆+ ) ⊂ it∗ for the set of highest weights
corresponding to unitary highest weight representations of G with respect to ∆+ .
                     Discrete group actions on Stein domains in complex Lie groups                7

      The interplay between irreducible holomorphic representations of S and unitary highest
weight representations of G is described in the following lemma. Recall that a cone W in a real
vector space V is called pointed if W contains no affine lines.
      The central ideas in the following theorem go back to Ol’shanskiı̆ (cf. [Ol82]) Stanton (cf.
[St86]).

Theorem 1.6. Let S = ΓG (W ) be a complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup and ∆+ be a k-adapted
positive system with Cmin ⊆ C ⊆ Cmax . Suppose that W is pointed.
  (1) If (π, H) is an irreducible holomorphic representation of S , then (π, H) extends to a
      strongly continuous representation of S , also denoted by (π, H), such that π |G is a uniquely
      determined unitary highest weight representation of G with respect to ∆+ .
  (2) Conversely, if (πλ , Hλ ) is a unitary highest weight representation of G with respect to ∆+ ,
      then (πλ , Hλ ) extends to a uniquely determined strongly continuous representation of S ,
      whose restriction to S is holomorphic and irreducible.
Proof.    This follows from [Ne99a, Th. XI.4.8] together with its following remark.
     We assume in the following that the cone W ⊆ g is pointed.

Remark 1.7. In the special case of the Jacobi group

                                 G: = HSp(n, R) = Hn ⋊ Sp(n, R)

(a group associated to the Jacobi algebra hsp(n, R); cf. Example 1.3(c)) it is interesting to see
what the unitary highest weight representations of G are. They are given by

                                               σµ ⊗ πλ,s

where σµ is an extended metaplectic representation of G and πλ,s is a unitary highest weight
representation of Sp(n, R) extended trivially to the Heisenberg group Hn (cf. [Ne99a, Sect. X.3]).
All these representations extend to holomorphic representations of the maximal open complex
Ol’shankiı̆ semigroup ΓG (int Wmax ).



    2. The manifolds Γ\S and some concepts from complex analysis
      Let S = ΓG (W ) = G Exp(iW ) be an open complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup and Γ < G a
discrete subgroup. In view of the polar decomposition of S (cf. Definition 1.1), the group Γ acts
via
                                   Γ × S → S, (γ, s) 7→ γs ,
freely and properly discontinuously on S . Thus the quotient Γ\S is Hausdorff and carries a
complex structure which is induced from the quotient map S → Γ\S, s 7→ Γs.



                                          Stein manifolds
      Since one of the main objectives of this paper is the investigation of the structure of the
complex manifolds Γ\S , especially whether they are Stein, we briefly recall here some facts
concerning Stein manifolds.
      If M is a complex manifold, then we write Hol(M ) for the space of holomorphic functions
on M . We endow Hol(M ) with the topology of compact convergence on M . Note that Hol(M )
is a Fréchet space provided M is second countable.
8                                                                                   March 15, 2001

 Definition 2.1. (Stein manifolds) Let M be a second countable complex manifold. Then M
 is called a Stein manifold, if the following two axioms are satisfied
(St1) The points of M are separated by Hol(M ).
(St2) The manifold M is holomorphically convex, i.e., for each compact subset K ⊆ M the
        holomorphically convex hull
                           b = {z ∈ M : (∀f ∈ Hol(M ))|f (z)| ≤ sup
                          K:                                           |f (w)|}
                                                                   w∈K
     is compact.

Theorem 2.2.       (Grauert) For a second countable complex manifold M , the following asser-
tions are equivalent:
  (1) The manifold M is Stein.
  (2) There exists a strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion function ϕ: M → R, i.e., ϕ is strictly
      plurisubharmonic and for all r ∈ R the set ϕ−1 (] − ∞, r]) is a compact subset of M .
Proof. [Hö73, Th. 5.2.10].

Theorem 2.3.       If E → M is a holomorphic principal bundle, such that the fiber and the
base M are Stein, then E is Stein.
Proof. [MaMo60, Th. 4].

Theorem 2.4. (Neeb) Let S be a complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup. Then there exists a G × G-
invariant strictly plurisubharmonic smooth function ϕ: S → R+ with
                                         lim ϕ(sn ) = ∞
                                        sn →s

for all s ∈ S\S .
Proof. [Ne98, Lemma 5.11].



                                  Invariant Hilbert spaces
     We conclude this section by introducing the concept of an invariant Hilbert space of
holomorphic functions.

Definition 2.5.     Let M be a complex manifold and G a group acting on M via
                                 M × G → M, (m, g) 7→ m.g ,
 by holomorphic automorphisms. Then a Hilbert space H ⊆ Hol(M ) is called a G-invariant
 Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on M if the following two axioms are satisfied:
(IH1) The inclusion map H ֒→ Hol(M ) is continuous.
(IH2) We have a unitary representation
                                 ρ: G → U (H), (ρ(g).f )(z): = f (z.g).
      Let (ρ, H) be an invariant Hilbert space. Then by (IH1) all point evaluations H →
C, f 7→ f (z) are continuous. Hence there exists for every z ∈ M an element Kz ∈ H such
that hf, Kz i = f (z) for all f ∈ H . The function
                       K: M × M → C, (z, w) 7→ K(z, w): = hKw , Kz i ,
is holomorphic in the first, antiholomorphic in the second variable and G-invariant, i.e., we have
K(z.g, w.g) = K(z, w) for all z, w ∈ M , g ∈ G. We call the function K the reproducing kernel
of (ρ, H). For further information on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces we refer to [Ne99a, Ch.
I-IV].

                  3. Constructing Γ -spherical representations

      In this section we give a construction of Γ-spherical highest weight representations for
arbitrary discrete subgroups Γ < G. It was an idea of Godement to obtain Γ-spherical rep-
resentations by averaging matrix coefficients of integrable representations of G (cf. [Bo66]). In
our setup however it is much more convenient to use the Bergman space B 1 (S) of integrable
holomorphic functions on S instead of L1 (G). This is because we can naturally realize highest
weight representations with sufficiently large parameter in the Hilbert space B 2 (S) (cf. [Kr98a]).



                   Hyperfunction vectors for unitary representations

Definition 3.1. Let G be a Lie group and H a Hilbert space.
(a) For a unitary representation (π, H) of G we denote by H∞ and Hω the space of all smooth,
respectively analytic vectors of (π, H). The corresponding strong antiduals are denoted by H−∞
and H−ω and their elements are called distribution, resp. hyperfunction vectors (see [KNÓ97,
Appendix] for the definition of the topology of Hω ). Note that there is a natural chain of
continuous inclusions
                                Hω ֒→ H∞ ֒→ H ֒→ H−∞ ֒→ H−ω .
The natural extension of (π, H) to a representation on the space of hyperfunction vectors is
denoted by (π −ω , H−ω ) and given explicitly by

                                   hπ −ω (g).ν, vi := hν, π(g −1 ).vi.

Note that (π −ω , H−ω ) is a continuous representation of G (cf. [KNÓ97, App.]).
(b) Let Γ ⊆ G be a closed subgroup. For a unitary representation (π, H) of G we write (H−ω )Γ
for the set of all those elements ν ∈ H−ω satisfying π −ω (γ).ν = ν for all γ ∈ Γ. The unitary
representation (π, H) is called Γ-spherical if there exist a cyclic vector ν ∈ (H−ω )Γ .

Remark 3.2. Even though in general the topology on the space of analytic vectors is hard to
deal with, one has a quite explicit picture for holomorphic representations of complex Ol’shanskiı̆
semigroups. Let G be a connected Lie group and (π, H) a unitary representation of G which
has an extension to a holomorphic representation of some complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup S =
G Exp(iW ). Then we have for each X ∈ iW
                                             [
                                      Hω =         π(Exp(tX)).H,
                                             t>0


and the topology on Hω is the finest locally convex topology on Hω making for all t > 0 the
maps H → Hω , v 7→ π(Exp(tX)).v continuous (cf. [KNÓ97, Appendix]). Note that we have
π(S).H−ω ⊆ Hω and that the action of S on H−ω is given by

                                    hπ −ω (s).ν, vi := hν, π(s∗ ).vi.

      A Lie group G is called a (CA)-Lie group ((CA)=closed adjoint) if Ad(G) is closed in
Aut(g). Note that most Lie groups are (CA)-Lie groups; in particular, all reductive and nilpotent
Lie groups have the (CA)-property (cf. [Ne99a, VII.1.13–VII.1.15]).
10                                                                                                            March 15, 2001

Lemma 3.3. Let (πλ , Hλ ) be a unitary highest weight representation of the (CA)-Lie group G
                               ⋆
with highest weight λ ∈ i int Cmin . Then there exists a X ∈ iC with Spec(dπλ (X)) ⊆ −β − N0
for some β ∈ R. Let (vn )n∈N be an orthonormal basis of Hλ consisting of tC -weight vectors.
Then for all t > 0 there exists a constant Ct > 0 such that
                                                ∞
                                                X
                            (∀w ∈ Hλ )                |hπλ (Exp(tX)).w, vn i| ≤ Ct kwk.
                                                n=1


Proof. Let Pλ denote the tC -weights of Hλ . Then Pλ ⊆ λ − N0 [∆+ ] as (πλ , Hλ ) is a highest
weight module with highest weight λ.
      Since C ⊆ int Cmax we have α(iY ) > 0 for all α ∈ ∆+    n and Y ∈ C . Moreover C is
Wk -invariant so that we can find an element Y ∈ C such that α(iY ) > 0 for all α ∈ ∆+ . Since
G is a (CA)-Lie group the group T /Z(G) is compact (cf. [Ne99a, Cor. VII.1.5]) and hence we
can choose X ∈ iC such that α(iX) ∈ N for all α ∈ ∆+ . This proves Spec(dπλ (X)) ⊆ −β − N0
for some β: = −λ(X) ∈ R.
                L
      Let Hλ = ∞   n=0 Hλ
                         −β−n
                               be the orthogonal decomposition of Hλ into dπλ (X)-eigenspaces.
                  −β−n
Set mn : = dim Hλ      and note that there exists an N ∈ N such that

                                         (∀n ∈ N)            mn ≤ (n + 1)N

(cf. [Ne99a, Lemma X.4.9]). Then (vn )n∈N = (vjn )1≤j≤mn ,n∈N with vjn ∈ Hλ−β−n for all
1 ≤ j ≤ mn .

                                                 Bergman spaces
     If G is a locally compact group, then we denote by µG a left Haar measure on G.
     Let S = ΓG (W ) be a complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup and H < G a unimodular subgroup.
Recall from [Kr98a, Sect. II] that there exists an S -invariant positive measure µH\S on H\S .
Denote by Hol(S)H the space of left H -invariant holomorphic functions on S . For each 1 ≤
p ≤ ∞ we write k · kp for the norm of the Banach space Lp (H\S, µH\S ). For 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ we
now define
                             B p (H\S): = {f ∈ Hol(S)H : kf kp < ∞}
                    Discrete group actions on Stein domains in complex Lie groups             11

and note that B p (H\S) is a Banach space of holomorphic functions on S (cf. [Kr98a, Prop.
II.4]); if p = 2 , then B 2 (H\S) is even a Hilbert space. If H = Γ is a discrete subgroup of
G, then we have Hol(S)Γ ∼    = Hol(Γ\S) and we call B 2 (Γ\S) the Bergman space of the complex

subgroup. Then the following assertion holds:
  (i) For all compact subsets Q ⊆ S there exists a constant CQ > 0 such that
                                               Z
                        (∀f ∈ B 1 (S))(∀s ∈ Q)     |f (hs)| dµH (h) ≤ CQ kf k1
                                                     H

      holds.
 (ii) The linear map
                                                                     Z
                     H    1         1                    H   H
                    I : B (S) → B (H\S), f 7→ f ; f (s) =                  f (hs) dµH (h) ,
                                                                       H

     is defined and a contraction of Banach spaces.
Proof. (i) Let Q ⊆ S be a compact subset. W.l.o.g. we may assume that there exists an open
relatively compact subset U ⊆ S such that Q ⊆ U ⊆ U ⊆ S and that HU ∼       = (H\HU )×H holds.
Thus we may assume that there exists a compact subset KH ⊆ H such that U ∼      = (H\HU )×KH .
It follows as in [Kr98a, Prop. II.4(i)] that there exists a constant cQ > 0 such that
                                                     Z
                              (∀s ∈ Q) |f (s)| ≤ cQ      |f (u)| dµS (u)
                                                         U

holds for all f ∈ Hol(S). For each f ∈ Hol(S) and g ∈ G we set fg (s) = f (gs). Note that
fg ∈ B 1 (S) provided f ∈ B 1 (S) since µS is G × G-biinvariant (cf. [Kr98a, Sect. II]). Thus we
get for all f ∈ B 1 (S) and s ∈ Q that
        Z                      Z                           Z Z
            |f (hs)| dµH (h) =     |fh (s)| dµH (h) ≤ cQ           |fh (u)| dµS (u) dµH (h)

                             = cQ          |f (hu)| dµH (h) dµS (u)

                             = cQ                   |f (h2 h1 u)| dµH (h2 ) dµH (h1 ) dµH\S (Hu)
                                    H\HU KH H
                                              Z      Z
                             ≤ cQ µH (KH )               |f (hu)| dµH (h) dµH\S (Hu)
                                                H\HU H

                             ≤ cQ µH (KH ) |f (s)| dµS (s) ≤ CQ kf k1 ,
                                            S

where CQ = cQ µH (KH ). This proves (i).
(ii) Let f ∈ B 1 (S). Then the inequality in (i) implies that f H ∈ Hol(S)H . It remains to show
that kf H k1 ≤ kf k1 . But this follows from
                        Z                        Z     Z                
                                                                        
              kf H k1 =       |f H (s)| dµH\S =           f (hs) dµH (h) dµH\S (Hs)
                         H\S                       H\S   H

                      ≤           |f (hs)| dµH (h) dµH\S (Hs) = kf k1 ,
                         H\S    H

completing the proof of (ii).

      Let (π, H) be a unitary representation of a Lie group G and (π ∗ , H∗ ) its dual representa-
tion. We denote by (b
                    π , B2 (H)) the unitary representation of G×G on Hilbert-Schmidt operators
on H given by π b(g1 , g2 ).A = π(g1 )Aπ(g2 )−1 for g1 , g2 ∈ G and A ∈ B2 (H). Recall that the
scalar product on B2 (H) is given by hA, Bi = tr(AB ∗ ) for all A, B ∈ B2 (H). Further we have
a natural equivalence

                 (π ⊗ π ∗ , H⊗H
                             b ∗ ) → (b
                                      π , B2 (H)), v ⊗ h·, wi 7→ Pv,w ; Pv,w (u): = hu, wiv.

     Let (R ⊗ L, Hol(S)) denote the right-left regular representation of G × G on Hol(S), i.e.,
we have
                                                                   
          (∀g1 , g2 ∈ G)(∀f ∈ Hol(S))(∀s ∈ S) (R ⊗ L)(g1 , g2 ).f (s) = f (g2−1 sg1 ).

Recall that for a unitary highest weight representation (πλ , Hλ ) all operators πλ (s), s ∈ S , are
of trace class (cf. [Ne99a, Th. XI.6.1]). Further the prescription

                        πλ , B2 (Hλ )) → (R ⊗ L, Hol(S)), A 7→ fAλ (s) = tr(Aπλ (s)).
                       (b

gives us a G × G-equivariant realization of B2 (Hλ ) as G × G-invariant Hilbert space of holo-
morphic functions on S (cf. Definition 2.5)

Theorem 3.5. Assume that G is a (CA)-Lie group and that Z = Z(G) is compact. If S is a
complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup, then we have a G × G-equivariant isomorphism of Hilbert spaces

                             (b                                                    b(λ)fAλ ,
                       λ∈Λ

with b(λ) > 0 for all λ ∈ Λ and

             Λ: = {λ ∈ HW (G, ∆+ ) ∩ iC ⋆ : λ + ρ ∈ i int Cmin
                                                           ⋆
                                                               , λ + 2ρ ∈ i int(C ∩ t+ )⋆ },

where ρ: =   2       α∈∆+   α and t+ : = {X ∈ t: (∀α ∈ ∆+ )iα(X) ≥ 0} .
Proof.     This is a special case of [Kr98a, Thm. IV.5].
      For the rest of this section we assume now that G is a (CA)-Lie group, Z(G) is compact.
We denote by K the analytic subgroup of G corresponding to k. Note that K is compact by
our assumptions on G.

Lemma 3.6. We have 2Λ ⊆ Λ . Further for all λ ∈ 2Λ and all T -finite analytic vectors
w ∈ HλT,ω we have a continuous G-equivariant inclusion mapping

                                        Φ: Hλω → B 1 (S), v 7→ fPλv,w ,

with fPλv,w (s) = hπλ (s).v, wi, s ∈ S .
Proof. We first show that 2Λ ⊆ Λ . Recall the description of Λ in Theorem 3.5. Let λ ∈ Λ .
            ⋆
Then ρ ∈ −iCmin implies that
                                                        ⋆       ⋆            ⋆
                         2λ + ρ = 2(λ + ρ) − ρ ∈ i int Cmin + iCmin ⊆ i int Cmin .

Thus 2λ is a parameter of the holomorphic discrete series and in particular we have 2λ ∈
HW (G, ∆+ ) (cf. [Ne99a, Sect. XII.5] for all that). Finally we have

                      2λ + 2ρ = (λ + 2ρ) + λ ∈ i int(C ∩ t+ )⋆ + iC ⋆ ⊆ i int(C ∩ t+ )⋆

since λ ∈ iC ⋆ and C ⋆ ⊆ (C ∩ t+ )⋆ . This concludes the proof of 2Λ ⊆ Λ .
      Let now λ ∈ Λ and write vλ , respectively v2λ , for a normalized highest weight vector in
Hλ , respectively H2λ . Denote by Hλ ⊗H b λ the G-module where G acts diagonally. Then the
prescription v2λ 7→ vλ ⊗ vλ gives rise to an equivariant embedding of H2λ into Hλ ⊗H     b λ (for
more details see the proof of [HiKr99, Th. 3.2.1] where a similar situation is dealt with). In the
                                  b λ . Note that H2λ T,ω
sequel we assume that H2λ ⊆ Hλ ⊗H                         ⊆ Hλ ⊗ Hλ so that by linearity we may
assume that w = w1 ⊗ w2 for some w1 , w2 ∈ Hλ .
      Let (vn )n∈N be an orthonormal basis of Hλ . Then (vn ⊗ vm )n,m∈N  P      constitutes an or-
thonormal basis of Hλ ⊗Hb λ . Hence v ∈ H2λ  ω
                                                 can be written as v = n,m cn,m vn ⊗ vm with
        P
kvk2 = n,m |cn,m |2 . Let X ∈ iC be as in Lemma 3.3. Then (X, X) ∈ i(C × C) meets the
same assumptions as X in Lemma 3.3 for the unitary highest weight
                                                                P      representation πλ ⊗ πλ of
G × G. Hence if v = π2λ (Exp(tX)).u for some u ∈ H2λ then          n,m n,m | ≤ Ct kuk by Lemma
                                                                      |c
3.3. Now the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality together with Theorem 3.5 gives

                 Ct
with ct : =     b(λ) kw1 k   · kw2 k < ∞. Thus we see that for all t > 0 the mapping

                                             H2λ → B 1 (S), v 7→ Φ(Exp(tX).v) ,

                                                             ω
is continuous. In view of the definition of the topology of H2λ , this proves the continuity of Φ.




                                                               Poincaré series

     Now we are going to construct Γ-spherical highest weight representations for generic
parameters in 2Λ .

Definition 3.7.              Let (π, H) be a unitary highest weight representation for G. For v ∈ H we
call                                                                      X
                                                               P (v): =         π(γ).v
                                                                          γ∈Γ

the Poincaré series of v , provided P (v) exists in H−ω , i.e., if
                                                                           X
                                                  Hω → C, w 7→                   hπ(γ).v, wi ,

is a continuous antilinear functional. Note that P (v) ∈ (H−ω )Γ .

Proposition 3.8. Let (πλ , Hλ ) be a unitary highest weight representation of G with λ ∈ 2Λ .
Then for all w ∈ HλT,ω the Poincaré series P (w) exists,P and defines a Γ-fixed hyperfunction
vector. Moreover, for all v ∈ Hλω the series hP (w), vi = γ∈Γ hπ(γ).w, vi converges absolutely.
Proof.      Let w ∈ HλT,ω , v ∈ Hλω and set
                                     fv : S → C, s 7→ hπλ (s).v, wi.
By Lemma 3.6 we have fv ∈ B 1 (S) and so fvΓ ∈ B 1 (Γ\S) with fvΓ converging absolutely on all
compact subsets Q ⊆ S , i.e.,

                                                                 X
(3.1)               (∃CQ > 0)(∀s ∈ Q)(∀f ∈ B 1 (S))                    |f (γs)| ≤ CQ kf k1
                                                                 γ∈Γ

(cf. Proposition 3.4). Let X ∈ iC and set st : = Exp(tX) for all t > 0 . Then Lemma 3.6 asserts
in particular that for all t > 0 there exists a constant Ct > 0 such that
(3.2)                           (∀v ∈ Hλ )          kfπλ (st ).v k1 ≤ Ct kvk.
        By the definition of the topology on Hλω , we only have to check the continuity of the maps
                                  Hλ → C, v 7→ hπλ (st ).v, P (w)i.
Fix now t > 0 and choose Q such that s: = s 2t ∈ Q . Then (3.1) and (3.2) imply that
                                     X
           |hπλ (st ).v, P (w)i| = |   hπλ (st ).v, πλ (γ).wi|
                                     γ∈Γ
                                     X                                      X
                                 ≤         |hπλ (s)πλ (s).v, πλ (γ).wi| =         |fπλ (s).v (γ −1 s)|
                                     γ∈Γ                                    γ∈Γ

                                 ≤ CQ kfπλ (s).v k1 ≤ CQ C 2t kvk.
This proves the proposition.
     Now we are going to show that the Poincaré series of the highest weight vector P (vλ ) is
non-zero for almost all parameters λ ∈ 2Λ . For that we have to recall some facts concernig the
generalized Harish-Chandra decomposition. Our source of reference is [Ne99a, Sect. XII.1].
     We denote by K the analytic subgroup of G corresponding to k. Note that K is compact
by our assumptions on G. Let KC denote the universal complexification of K and note that
K ⊆ KC . By GC we denote the universal complexification of G.
     We define subalgebras of gC by
                              p+ : = ⊕α∈∆+ gα
                                         n C
                                                     and p− : = ⊕α∈∆− gα
                                                                    n C


and note that p± are abelian since W was assumed to be pointed. Further we have gC =
p− ⊕ kC ⊕ p+ .
     Let P ± denote the analytic subgroups of GC corresponding to p± . Assume for the moment
that G ⊆ GC . Then the multiplication mapping
                        P − × KC × P + → P − KC P + , (p− , k, p+ ) 7→ p− kp+ .
is biholomorphic and we have G ⊆ S ֒→ P − KC P + .
      For the general case we can use some standard covering theory to lift the results from above:
We obtain a complex manifold P − KC P + with a biholomorphic map P − ×KC ×P + → P − KC P +
and the inclusion chain from before also lifts: G ⊆ S ֒→ P − KC P + .
      We denote by κ: S → KC the middle projection. Set t0 = t∩[k, k] and note that t = t0 ⊕z(k).
Accordingly we have t∗ = t∗0 ⊕ z(k)∗ .

Proposition 3.9. Let λ0 ∈ it∗0 be dominant integral for ∆+
                                                         k .
                                         ∗
 (i) There exists a lattice Γz(k) ⊆ iz(k) such that

                                       λ0 + (Γz(k) ∩ iC ⋆ )\{0} ⊆ 2Λ.
                                               
 (ii) Fix ζ ∈ HW (G, ∆+ ) ∩ (Γz(k) ∩ iC ⋆ )\{0} and set λn : = λ0 + nζ . Then there exists an
      N0 ∈ N such that λn ∈ 2Λ for all n ≥ N0 , n ∈ N. Further there exists an n ∈ N, n ≥ N0
      such that
                                        hP (vλn ), vλn i 6= 0,
     where vλn is a normalized highest weight vector for (πλn , Hλn ).
Proof.      (i) This follows from the structure of the set of unitary highest weights (cf. [Kr99,
Sect. IV]) together with our explicit description of Λ .
(ii) From the definition of Λ it is clear that there exists an N0 ∈ N such that λn ∈ 2Λ for all
n ≥ N0 , n ∈ N. Define N≥N0 : = N ∩ [N0 , ∞[. We consider the function
                                                               X
                   F : N≥N0 → C, n 7→ hP (vλn ), vλn i =           hπλn (γ).vλn , vλn i.

Note that the defining series converges absolutely by Proposition 3.8.
       If (πλ , Hλ ) is any unitary highest weight representation of G, then F (λ): = span{π(K).vλ }
is a finite dimensional irreducible representation of K . Hence the representation (πλ , F (λ)) of
K naturally extends to a holomorphic representation of KC . By [Kr98b, Prop. II.20] we now
have hπλ (s).vλ , vλ i = hπλ (κ(s)).vλ , vλ i for all λ ∈ HW (G, ∆+ ) and s ∈ S , and so
                                                      X

                                    KC =          e C Nk ,

                                             w∈Wk

        e C represents w . Fix n ∈ N and consider the function
      e∈K
where w

                               f : KC → C, k 7→ hπλn (k).vλn , vλn i.

                                                                     e C Nk with w
The fact that λ0 is regular implies that f vanishes on all cells Nk wT           e 6= 1. Write
an element k ∈ Nk TC Nk as k = n(k)t(k)n(k) and note that f (k) = f (t(k)) = t(k)λn . Thus we
have
                                           
                                             0        if k 6∈ Nk TC Nk ,
(3.4)                   (∀k ∈ KC ) f (k) =                               .
                                             t(k)λn if k ∈ Nk TC Nk

      The set {t(κ(γ)) ∈ TC : γ ∈ Γ} defines a countable family (tj )j∈N ⊆ TC . Then (3.3) and
(3.4) give that
                                                   X∞
                                                        n(λ +ζ)
                                F : N≥N0 → C, n 7→     tj 0 .
                                                         j=1

Now it follows from Lemma 3.10 below that F (n) 6= 0 for at least one n ∈ N proving the
proposition.

Lemma 3.10. Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space, V ∗ its dual and VC = V +iV its
complexification. Let C ⊆ V ∗ be a convex cone and Γ ⊆ V ∗ be a lattice. Suppose that C ∩ Γ 6= Ø
and that there exists a sequence (zn )n∈N in VC such that
                                                     X
                                F : C ∩ Γ → C, λ 7→       eλ(zn ) ,
                                                                            n∈N

is defined by absolutely convergent series. Then F 6= 0 .
Proof.     The assertion of the lemma easily reduces to the one dimensional case, i.e., V = R.
By rescaling we may assume that Γ = Z. Then C = R or C = ±]0, ∞[ and taking a subcone of
C we, up to sign, may assume that C =]0, ∞[. Then we have Z∩]0, ∞[= N and
                                                                        ∞
                                                                        X
                                             F : N → C, m 7→                  emzn ,
                                                                        n=1
       P∞          m Re(zn )
with     n=1   e               < ∞ for all m ∈ N. Hence Re(zn ) > 0 for only finitely many n ∈ N and
                                         x0 : = supn∈N {Re zn : n ∈ N} < ∞.
Further F extends to a bounded analytic function
                                                                            ∞
                                                                            X
                                            f : ]1, ∞[→ C, λ 7→                   eλzn .
                                                                            n=1

To obtain a contradiction, assume that F = 0 . Then f = 0 by [Kr01, App. A].
      W.l.o.g. we may assume that Re zn = x0 exactly for 1 ≤ n ≤ N for some N ∈ N and that
z1 = zj exactly for 1 ≤ j ≤ k , k ≤ N . Then dominated convergence gives that

                                                                                           2
                                                           j=k+1

Since the one parameter subsemigroup
                                   {(eiλ Im(zk+1 −z1 ) , . . . , eiλ Im(zN −z1 ) ): λ > λ0 }
in (S1 )N −k contains elements arbitary close to the identity 1 ∈ (S1 )N −k , we arrive at a
contradiction, proving the lemma.
       We now summarize the main results of this section.

Theorem 3.11.       Let S = ΓG (W ) be a complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup with G a (CA)-Lie
group and Z(G) compact. Let U be any open cone in iC ⋆ . Then for every discrete subgroup
Γ < G there exist a Γ-spherical contractive unitary highest weight representation (πλ , Hλ ) of G
with λ ∈ U and compact kernel.
Proof. Note that non-zero Γ-fixed hyperfunction vectors for a unitary highest weight repre-
sentation (πλ , Hλ ) are cyclic, since HλT,ω is dense in Hλω (cf. [HiKr99, Lemma 6.2.1]). Therefore
it follows from Proposition 3.8 and Proposition 3.9 (ii) that there exists a Γ-spherical unitary
highest weight representation of G. Moreover the representations belonging to a parameter
λ ∈ 2Λ are contractive since Λ ⊆ iC ⋆ (cf. [Kr99, Lemma IV.13]). The remaining statement
of the theorem now follows from Proposition 3.9(ii) together with [Ne99a, Lemma X.4.7, Th.
X.4.8].

                 4. Point separation and vansihing at infinity

       In this section we construct rich classes of holomorphic functions on Γ\S . For Γ < G
cocompact we construct a class of point separating holomorphic functions on Γ\S which vanish
at infinity. For arbitray Γ we will show that Hol(Γ\S) separates the points.



                        Compact G-orbits in the hyperfunctions

Lemma 4.1. Let s0 = Exp(X0 ) with X0 ∈ iC . Then the following assertions hold:
                                     
  (i) Ss0 ⊆ G Exp conv(Wk .X0 ) + iC G.
 (ii) There exists an X ∈ iC such that

                                        Ss0 ⊆ G Exp(X + iC)G.


Proof.    (i) For Z ∈ iC set FZ,X0 : = conv(Wk .(Z + X0 )) + iC . Then [Ne97, Prop. V.1] shows
that
                      (∀Z ∈ iC)     Exp(Z)G Exp(X0 ) ⊆ G Exp(FZ,X0 )G.

Now we have

              Wk .(Z + X0 ) ⊆ Wk .Z + Wk .X0 ⊆ Wk .X0 + iC ⊆ conv(Wk .X0 ) + iC

for all Z ∈ iC . Hence (i) follows from S = G Exp(iC)G.
(ii) Let ≤C denote the conal order on the convex cone iC , i.e., for X, Y ∈ iC one has X ≤C Y
if and only if X ∈ Y + iC . Since conv(Wk .X0 ) is compact, we therefore find an element Y ∈ iC
such that Y ≤C conv(Wk .X0 ), i.e., conv(Wk .X0 ) ⊆ Y + iC . In view of (i), this proves (ii).

Lemma 4.2. Let (π, H) be a holomorphic representation of S . Suppose that Γ\G is compact
and let v Γ ∈ (H−ω )Γ . Then the following assertions hold:
  (i) The orbit π −ω (G).v Γ is compact in H−ω .
                                             
 (ii) For all X0 ∈ iC the set π −ω Exp(X0 ) π −ω (G).v Γ is compact in H .
Proof. (i) Recall from Definition 3.1 that the representation (π −ω , H−ω ) of G is continuous,
i.e., the map
                         G × H−ω → H−ω , (g, v) 7→ π −ω (g).v ,

is continuous. Thus π −ω (G).v Γ is compact by the cocompactness of Γ in G.
(ii) Recall the definition of the topology on Hω (cf. Remark 3.2). Being the strong dual of the
analytic vectors Hω , the topology on H−ω is the finest locally convex topology for which all
maps
                            H−ω → H, v 7→ π −ω (Exp(tX0 )).v, t > 0,

become continuous. Hence for all compact subsets K ⊆ H−ω , the set π −ω (Exp(X0 )).K is
compact in H . In view of (i), this proves (ii).

           Realizing Γ-spherical representations in holomorphic functions

     Throughout this subsection (π, H) denotes a holomorphic representation of a complex
Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup. We assume that (π, H) is Γ-spherical for an arbitrary discrete subgroup
Γ < G.
     Fix now a cyclic element v Γ ∈ (H−ω )Γ . By [KNÓ97, App.] the mapping

(4.1)                 r: H → Hol(Γ\S), v 7→ fv ; fv (Γs): = hπ(s).v, v Γ i ,

is injective, continuous and G-equivariant, i.e., the map r gives us a realization of H as a G-
invariant Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on Γ\S (cf. Definition 2.5). In the sequel we
assume that H ⊆ Hol(Γ\S). Recall from Section 2 that there is a reproducing kernel K for H .

Lemma 4.3. Let (π, H) be a Γ-spherical holomorphic representation of S realized in the
holomorphic functions on Γ\S via the realization (4.1). If K is the reproducing kernel of H ,
then KΓs = π(s∗ ).v Γ , s ∈ S , and

                        (∀s, t ∈ S)    K(Γs, Γt) = hπ(t∗ ).v Γ , π(s∗ ).v Γ i.


Proof.    This is analogous to the proof of [HiKr01, Th. 4.1.1].

Proposition 4.4. Assume that Γ\G is compact and let (π, H) be a Γ-spherical holomorphic
contraction representation of S . Then the following assertions hold:
  (i) Fix X0 ∈ iC and set s0 : = Exp(X0 ). Then, the reproducing kernel K of H is bounded
      when restricted to Γ\Ss0 × Γ\Ss0 . In particular, there exists a constant C = C(s0 ) such
      that
                                     (∀s ∈ Ss0 )     kKΓs k ≤ C.

 (ii) All analytic vectors Hω are bounded holomorphic functions on Γ\S .
Proof.    (i) By Lemma 4.3 we have K(Γs, Γt) = hπ(t∗ ).v Γ , π(s∗ ).v Γ i. Since |K(z, w)|2 ≤
K(z, z)K(w, w) for all z, w ∈ Γ\S (cf. [Ne99a, Ch. I]), we have

                           supz,w∈Γ\S |K(z, w)| ≤ supz∈Γ\S K(z, z).

In view of Lemma 4.1 we have Ss0 ⊆ G Exp(X) Exp(iC)G for some X ∈ iC . Therefore we get
for all s ∈ S that

          kKΓss0 k2 = K(Γss0 , Γss0 ) = kπ(ss0 ).v Γ k2 ≤ supg∈G kπ(Exp(X))π(g).v Γ k2 ,

since (π, H) is contractive and Exp(X) commutes with Exp(iC). But now the assertion follows
from Lemma 4.2(ii).
(ii) Let f ∈ Hω . Then f ∈ π(s0 ).H for some s0 = Exp(X0 ), X0 ∈ iC . Thus we can write
f = π(s0 ).g with g ∈ H . But then (i) implies that

              sups∈S |f (Γs)| = sups∈Ss0 |g(s)| = sups∈Ss0 |hg, KΓs i| ≤ C(s0 )kgk.

                                        Vanishing at infinity
     In this subsection we show that the analytic vectors of certain invariant Hilbert spaces of
holomorphic functions on Γ\S are vanishing at infinity.

Lemma 4.5. Let s0 = Exp(X0 ) ∈ S , X0 ∈ iC , and (sn )n∈N be a sequence in Ss0 .
 (i) There exists an element X ∈ iC such that
                                        sn = gn h−1
                                                 n Exp(X + Xn )hn

      with gn , hn ∈ G, Xn ∈ iC .
 (ii) Assume now that Γ < G is cocompact and that (Γsn )n∈N leaves every compact subset in
      Γ\S . Then the sequence h−1
                                n Exp(X + Xn )hn leaves every compact subset of Exp(W ). In
      particular we have Xn → ∞ in iC or hn → ∞ in G.
Proof. (i) This follows from Lemma 4.1.
(ii) Note that there is a polar decomposition of Γ\S
                                            Γ\G × W → Γ\S
which is a homeomorphic mapping. As Γ\G is compact, (ii) follows now from (i).

Theorem 4.6. (Vanishing at Infinity) Let Γ < G be cocompact and (πλ , Hλ ) be a Γ-spherical
unitary highest weight representation of G with λ ∈ i int C ⋆ . Assume further that G is a (CA)-
Lie group and that Z(G) is compact. Let v ∈ Hω and fv (Γs) = hπ(s).v, v Γ i the corresponding
holomorphic function on Γ\S . Then fv extends to a continuous function on Γ\S , also denoted
by fv and the following assertions hold:
  (i) The function fv is bounded.
 (ii) We have lim s→∞ fv (s) = 0 .
                   s∈Γ\S

Proof.      Fix X0 ∈ iC and set st : = Exp(tX0 ) for t > 0 . Then Hλω = ∪t>0 πλ (st ).Hλ shows
that there is a t0 > 0 such that v = πλ (st0 ).w for some w ∈ Hλ . Set s0 : = st0 . Then Ss0 ⊆ S
shows that there is a continuous extension of fv to Γ\S .
(i) Proposition 4.4(ii).
(ii) Let (sn )n∈N be a sequence in S such that Γsn → ∞ in Γ\S . We claim that Γsn s0 → ∞ in
Γ\S . For that it is sufficient to show that the mapping
                                    ρΓ (s0 ): Γ\S → Γ\, Γs 7→ Γs0
is proper. Recall from [HiNe93, Th. 3.20] that S acts via right multiplication on S by proper
maps. In particular, ρ(s0 ): S → S, s 7→ ss0 is proper. Let now QΓ ⊆ Γ\S be a compact
subset. Then we find a compact subset Q ⊆ S such that QΓ = Γ\ΓQ . Since ρ(s0 ) is proper,
the set ρ(s0 )−1 (Q) is compact. Hence ρΓ (s0 )−1 (QΓ ) = Γ\Γρ(s0 )−1 (Q) is compact, establishing
our claim.
      By Lemma 4.5 we find an element X ∈ C such that
                                    sn s0 = gn h−1
                                                n Exp(X + Xn )hn

for elements gn , hn ∈ G, Xn ∈ iC . Then Lemma 4.3 and Proposition 4.4 show that
              fv (Γsn ) = fw (Γsn s0 ) = hw, KΓsn s0 i = hw, πλ (s0 s∗n ).v Γ i

                                              2                    2
20                                                                                           March 15, 2001

Since Γ\G is compact, Lemma 4.2(ii) implies that Q: = πλ−ω (Exp( 12 X)G).v Γ is compact in Hλ .
Thus we get

                                                                 1
(4.2)                 |fv (Γsn )| ≤ supu∈Q |hπλ (hn ).w, πλ (Exp( X + Xn )).ui|.
                                                                 2

As Γsn tends to infinity in Γ\S we have hn → ∞ in G or Xn → ∞ in C (cf. Lemma 4.5(ii)).
Case 1: Xn → ∞. Then 12 X + Xn → ∞ in iC and we have

                                    1                           1
                           kπλ (Exp( X + Xn ))k = supw∈Wk ew.λ( 2 X+Xn )
                                    2

(cf. [Kr99, Lemma 4.13]). Thus λ ∈ i int C ⋆ and the fact that C is Wk -invariant (and hence
i int C ⋆ ) shows that kπλ (Exp( 12 X + Xn ))k → 0 . It follows from (4.2) that

                                                                  1
                lim |fv (Γsn )| ≤ kwk · supu∈Q kuk · lim kπλ (Exp( X + Xn ))k = 0.
               n→∞                                  n→∞           2

Case 2: hn → ∞. We may assume that Xn stays in a compact subset of iC because of Case 1.
Then πλ (Exp( 12 X + Xn )).Q stays in a compact subset Q′ ⊇ Q of Hλ and (4.2) implies that

                                 |fv (Γsn )| ≤ supu∈Q′ |hπλ (hn ).w, ui|.

Note that (πλ , Hλ ) has compact kernel, since G is a (CA)Lie group, Z(G) is compact and
λ ∈ i int C ⋆ (cf. the proof of [Kr98a, Prop. V.7]). Hence the facts that (πλ , Hλ ) is irreducible
and G is a (CA)-Lie group imply that Mayer’s generalization of the Howe-Moore Theorem (cf.
[Ma97, Prop. 3.4], [HoMo79, Th. 5.1]) applies and so limn→∞ |f (Γsn )| = 0 .




                                Separating holomorphic functions
     Now we are ready to prove the main result in this section. Recall from [Ko98, Ch. 3, §2]
the definition of the Caratheodory semimetric and note that the Caratheodory semimetric is a
metric if and only if the bounded holomorphic functions separate the points.

Theorem 4.7.          (Separation of Points) Let S be a complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroup associated
to a (CA)-Lie group G. Let Γ < G be an arbitrary discrete subgroup of G. Then the following
assertions hold:
   (i) For every z1 , z2 ∈ Γ\S , z1 6= z2 , there exists an f ∈ B 1 (Γ\S) such that 0 6= f (z1 ) 6= f (z2 ).
       In particular Hol(Γ\S) separates the points of Γ\S .
  (ii) If Γ < G is cocompact, then the bounded holomorphic functions on Γ\S separate the points.
       In particular, the Caratheodory semimetric on Γ\S is a metric.
Proof.      (i) The proof uses a trick which was used by Siegel in order to show that the Siegel
modular forms separate the points on G/K (cf. [Fr83]).
     Let C0 (Γ\S) denote the algebra of continuous function on Γ\S which vanish at infinity.
Then it follows from [Kr98a, Prop. II.4(i)(b)] and a slight adapation of [Kr98a, Lemma V.13]
that B 1 (S) ∩ C0 (S) separates the points of S .
     Let now Γs1 , Γs2 ∈ Γ\S be two different points. Let f ∈ B 1 (S) ∩ C0 (S) be such that

                                 m: = supγ∈Γ {|f (γs1 )|, |f (γs2 )|} > 0.
                     Discrete group actions on Stein domains in complex Lie groups                           21

By Proposition 3.4 we know that for every f ∈ B 1 (S) and s ∈ S one has


                                                      X
(4.3)                                  |f Γ (s)| ≤          |f (γs)| < ∞
                                                      γ∈Γ


and f Γ ∈ B 1 (Γ\S).
     Hence the supremum m is actually attained and without loss of generality we may assume
that m = 1 = f (s1 ). Let now

                         Γ0 : = {γ ∈ Γ\{1}: |f (γs1)| = 1           or |f (γs2 )| = 1}

and note that Γ0 is a finite set by (4.3). Since B 1 (S) ∩ C0 (S) separates the points of S we find
a g ∈ B 1 (S) ∩ C0 (S) such that

                         g(s1 ) = 1 and g(γs1 ) = g(γs2 ) = 0                 (∀γ ∈ Γ0 ).

For every n ∈ N we now consider the function

                                             Fn (s) = g(s)f n (s)

and note that Fn ∈ B 1 (S). Averaging over Γ we obtain that
                                                        X
                                     (Fn )Γ (Γs) =            g(γs)f n (γs)
                                                       γ∈Γ


for all s ∈ S . Note that (Fn )Γ ∈ B 1 (Γ\S). Now we have
                                                      X
                               |(Fn )Γ |(Γs2 ) ≤              |g(γs2 )||f n (γs2 )|
                                                     γ∈Γ\Γ0


and we see that limn→∞ (Fn )Γ (Γs2 ) = 0 by (4.3) and |f (γs2 )| < 1 for all γ ∈ Γ\Γ0 . On the
other hand we have


                                             X                                    X
          (Fn )Γ (Γs1 ) = g(s1 )f (s1 ) +            g(γs2 )f n (γs2 ) = 1 +             g(γs2 )f n (γs2 )
                                            γ∈Γ\Γ0                              γ∈Γ\Γ0


and by the same reason as before we have limn→∞ (Fn )Γ (Γs1 ) = 1 . Hence there exists an n ∈ N
such that (Fn )Γ (Γs1 ) 6= (Fn )Γ (Γs2 ) proving (i)
(ii) In view of the proof of (i), this follows from Proposition 4.4.

Remark 4.8. By Neeb’s version of the Gelfand-Raikov theorem (cf. [Ne99, Th. XI.5.1]) for
complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups, the bounded holomorphic functions on S separate the points.
It follows that S is hyperbolic complex. Hence Γ\S is hyperbolic complex for arbitrary discrete
subgroups Γ < G by [Sh92, §20, Th. 1]. To compare this with the results above notice that
Theorem 4.7(ii) is a stronger statement than that Γ\S is hyperbolic complex.

Example 4.9. (a) Let G be a linear Hermitian Lie group. Then by a theorem of Borel (cf.
[Bo63, Th. C], [Ra72, Th. 14.1]) there exist cocompact lattices Γ < G. Further the Lie algebra
of g admits pointed open convex Ad(G)-invariant elliptic cones Ø 6= W ⊆ g. Set S = ΓG (W ).
Then by Theorem 4.8 the bounded holomorphic functions on Γ\S separate points.
(b) Let h1 = RX ⊕ RY ⊕ RZ be the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra with relations [X, Y ] = Z
and all other brackets vanishing. Then a = RT acts on h by derivations via [T, X] = Y ,
[T, Y ] = −X and [T, Z] = 0 . Then g = h ⋊ a is a four dimensional solvable Lie algebra, the
so-called oscillator algebra. It is the basic example of a solvable Lie algebra admitting pointed
open invariant convex cones Ø 6= W ⊆ g. Note that t = RZ ⊕ a is a compactly embedded Cartan
subalgebra of g.
       Let H1 ∼
              = R3 denote the simply connected Heisenberg group corresponding to h1 . We have
a connected Lie group G = H1 ⋊ S1 with Lie algebra g. Then Γ = Z2 × 21 Z ⊆ H1 is a cocompact
lattice in G and hence the bounded holomorphic functions on Γ\S separate points by Theorem
4.8.
(c) Now we give an example of a Lie group G of mixed type, i.e., G is neither reductive nor
solvable. We define a quadratic form

                             F : R3 → R, (x, y, z) 7→ x2 + y 2 − 3z 2

and let L: = SO0 (F, R) denote the connected component of the special invariance group of F .
Then F does not represent zero in a non-trivial rational way so that ΓL : = SO0 (F, Z) forms a
cocompact lattice in L (cf. [Bo69, 8.6, Ex. 1]).
      Let h·, ·i2,1 denote the non degenerate symmetric bilinear form on R3 induced by F . Then
the prescription
                                                                 
            ΩF : (R3 × R3 ) × (R3 × R3 ) → R, (u, v), (u′ , v ′ ) 7→ hu, v ′ i2,1 − hu′ , vi2,1

defines an L -invariant symplectic form on R3 × R3 (we let L act diagonally). Associated to ΩF
we build the nilpotent Lie algebra u: = (R3 × R3 ) × R with bracket
                                                                                         
                         [((u, v), z), ((u′ , v ′ ), z ′ )] = 0, ΩF ((u, v), (u′ , v ′ )) .

Note that u is isomorphic to the 7-dimensional Heisenberg algebra h3 . Let U denote a simply
connected Lie group with Lie algebra u. Then U ∼  = (R3 × R3 ) × R and ΓU : = (Z3 × Z3 ) × 12 Z is
a cocompact lattice in U which is stable under ΓL . Thus Γ: = ΓU ⋊ ΓL is a cocompact lattice
in the semidirect product G: = U ⋊ L .
      Note that there is an embedding of g into the Jacobi algebra h3 ⋊ sp(3, R) sending u
isomorphically onto h3 and l: = L(L) into sp(3, R). In view of [Ne99a, Ch. VII], this embedding
guarantees us the existence of non-trivial pointed Ad(G)-invariant open convex cones W ⊆ g.
Now the bounded holomorphic functions on Γ\ΓG (W ) separate points by Theorem 4.8.



             5. The Stein property of Γ\S for Γ\G = Sl(2, Z)\ Sl(2, R)
    We let the group G = Sl(2, R) act on the upper halfplane Π+ : = {z ∈ C: Im z > 0} by

Let U =             be the infinitesimal generator of the maximal compact subgroup K =
            −1 0
SO(2, R) of G. Set R− =] − ∞, 0[. Then it is easily shown that

                                  S = G exp(iR− U )G = G exp(iW )
with W = Ad(G).R− U the lower light cone in g = sl(2, R). Note that W and −W are the only
non-trivial Ad(G)-invariant pointed convex cones in g.
     Let Γ = Sl(2, Z) be the modular group. For z ∈ Π+ set q: = e2πiz . Then the discriminant

                                                                    cγ dγ

For g =          ∈ G and z ∈ Π+ we define
           c d

                                           µ(g, z): = cz + d

and note that µ is a cocycle, i.e., µ(g1 g2 , z) = µ(g1 , g2 .z)µ(g2 , z) for all g1 , g2 , ∈ G, z ∈ Π+ .
Then the description

                                  f∆ : G → C, g 7→ µ(g, i)12 ∆(g.i)
defines a left Γ-invariant analytic function on G (cf. [Bo66]). Since S compresses Π+ , we see
that µ extends to a continuous function µ(s, z), s ∈ S , z ∈ Π+ , with no zeros. By the same
reason the prescription s 7→ ∆(s.i) defines a continuous function on S . Hence we can analytically
continue f∆ to a continuous function

                                  F∆ : S → C, s 7→ µ(s, i)12 ∆(s.i)

which is holomorphic when restricted to S . Note that F∆ is left Γ-invariant and hence factors
to a function on Γ\S , also denoted by F∆ .
      It is a consequence of [KO01, Th. 3.2] that F∆ vanishes at infinity on Γ\S , i.e.,

(5.1)                                       lim F∆ (Γs) = 0.

                                          Γs∈Γ\S


Let us briefly scetch the proof of this fact. The discriminant ∆ is bounded on a fundamental
domain for Γ in Π+ . Hence it is sufficient to show that lim s→∞ µ(s, i) = 0 . For G = Sl(2, R) this

can be seen by direct calculation; more generally it follows from the fact that the middle projection
κ: P − KC P + → KC restricted to S is a proper map and has image κ(S) = K exp(iR− U ) (cf.
[KO01, Prop. 1.2, Cor. 2.4]). We note that F∆ has no zeroes on Γ\S . Hence |F1∆ | defines a
continuous plurisubharmonic function on Γ\S and (5.1) implies that

Theorem 5.1.      Let S be a complex Ol’shanskı̆ semigroup associated to G = Sl(2, R) and let
Γ = Sl(2, Z). Then Γ\S is Stein.
Proof. In view of Grauert’s solution of the Levi problem (cf. Theorem 2.2), it is sufficient to
prove the existence of a strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion function of Γ\S .
     Let ψ be the non-negative biinvariant plurisubharmonic function on S from Theorem 2.4.
Then ψ factorizes to a function on Γ\S which we also denote by ψ . Then
                                                        1
                                           ϕ: = ψ +
                                                      |F∆ |

defines a strictly plurisubharmonic function on Γ\S . To conclude the proof of the theorem it
suffices to show that ϕ is proper. Let (zn )n∈N be a sequence in Γ\S leaving every compact
subset of Γ\S . Then we either have zn → z ∈ Γ\S − (Γ\S) or zn → ∞ in Γ\S . In the first
case we have ψ(zn ) → ∞ by Theorem 2.4 while in the latter case limn→∞ |F∆ 1(zn )| = ∞ by (5.2).
This concludes the proof of the theorem.

Remark 5.2. (a) Note that by Theorem 2.3 now also for all subgroups Γ0 < Sl(2, Z) the
manifold Γ0 \S is Stein.
(b) Let G be a hermitian Lie group and Γ < G a lattice. We claim that there exists no
holomorphic cusp forms on G/K without zeros if Γ < G is cocompact or if the real rank
rank(G) of G is strictly larger than one. Since if f were a holomorphic cusp form without zeros,
then f1 would again be an automorphic form. If Γ < G is cocompact, this is clear, and if Γ < G
is not cocompact and rank(G) > 1 , then this is implied by the Koecher-principle (cf. [Fr83,
Ch. I, Hilfssatz 3.5]). Now f1 would be of “negative weight” which is impossible since there are
no automorphic forms of negative weight (if Γ < G is cocompact, this is a consequence of the
Plancherel Theorem for L2 (Γ\G) and in the non-cocompact case this can be proved as in [Fr83,
Ch. I, Satz 3.13]).
      Therefore our construction for Sl(2, R) cannot be generalized to arbitrary hermitian groups
nor to the case of cocompact subgroups.

Conjecture 5.3. We conjecture that Γ\S is Stein for all complex Ol’shanskiı̆ semigroups and
all discrete subgroups Γ < G. In view of the proof of Theorem 5.1, it would be sufficient to find
a holomorphic function on Γ\S with no zeros and which vanishes at infinity on Γ\S . If Γ < G
is cocompact, then we have seen in Theorem 4.6 that all matrix coefficients fv (Γs) = hπ(s).v, v Γ i
for v ∈ Hω vanish at infinity. The difficulty is to show that there exists a certain v ∈ Hω so that
fv has no zeros. As we pointed out in Remark 5.2, this can never happen if v is a highest weight
vector. But it is likely to be true that fv has no zeros for all v ∈ πλ (S).v Γ , as the reproducing
kernel

                                 K(Γs, Γt) = hπ(t∗ ).v Γ , π(s∗ ).v Γ i
of the realiztion of (π, H) in Hol(Γ\S) should be zero-free by general principles. However, this
seems to be a very challenging problem, even for G = Sl(2, R).
