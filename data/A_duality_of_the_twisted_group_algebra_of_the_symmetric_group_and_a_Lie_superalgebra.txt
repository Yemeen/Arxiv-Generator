                                                The “character values” of the irreducible projective representations of Sk , the
                                             symmetric group of degree k, were determined by I. Schur using Schur’s Q-functions,
                                             which are indexed by the distinct partitions of k, [10], in a way analogous to Frobe-
                                             nius’ formula for the character values of the ordinary irreducible representations of
                                             Sk [2]. Behind Frobenius’ formula exists a duality relation of Sk and the general
                                             linear group GL(n) (the Schur-Weyl duality). It is natural to expect the existence
                                             of an analogous duality relation between the twisted group algebra Ak (cf. (1.2))
                                             of Sk and some algebra, behind Schur’s method. A. N. Sergeev showed that a
                                             twisted group algebra Bk (cf. (1.3)) of the hyperoctahedral group Hk and a Lie
                                             superalgebra q(n) (cf. §1, G) act on the k-th tensor product W = V ⊗k of the 2n-
                                             dimensional natural representation V = Cn ⊕ Cn of q(n), as mutual commutants
                                             of each other [11] (in the sense of Z/2Z-graded algebras, see §1, E). This result
                                             motivated our work.
                                                In this paper, we establish a duality relation between Ak and q(n) on a sub-
                                             space of W , and give a representation-theoretic explanation of Schur’s identity (1.6)
                                             adapted to the context of Z/2Z-graded representations by T. Józefiak (Corollary
                                             4.2).
                                                                                                   .
                                                In §3, we construct an isomorphism Bk ∼     = Ck ⊗ Ak of Z/2Z-graded      algebras
                                                                                                                     .
                                                                               k
                                             (Theorem 3.2), where Ck is the 2 -dimensional Clifford algebra and ⊗ denotes the
                                             Z/2Z-graded tensor product (cf. §1, E). This isomorphism does imply an embed-
                                             ding Ak ֒→ Bk , although Ak does not sit in Bk in an obvious manner (cf. §1,
                                             D). Then, we give a simple relation between the Z/2Z-graded irreducible represen-
                                             tations of Bk and Ak (Proposition 3.5). Note that J. R. Stembridge constructed
                                             the non-graded simple modules of the underlying algebra |Bk | as submodules of
                                             non-graded tensor products of modules of three twisted group algebras of Hk [13],

but his description of the simple |Bk |-modules does not immediately show a simple
relation between Ak and Bk .
   In §4, we give a submodule W ′ of W , as a simultaneous eigenspace of 2⌊k/2⌋
involutions contained in Ck , where ⌊k/2⌋ denotes the largest integer not exceeding
k/2, and show that Ak and q(n) act on W ′ as mutual commutants of each other
in the context of Z/2Z-graded algebras (Theorem 4.1).
   In this paper, all vector spaces, and associative algebras, and representations in
this paper are assumed to be finite dimensional unless otherwise stated, and over
the complex number field C.

                          1. Preliminaries and notations
A. The hyperoctahedral group Hk . The hyperoctahedral group Hk is the
group generated by t and the si , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, subject to relations

(1.1)        t2 = s2i = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1),
             (si si+1 )3 = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2),       (si sj )2 = 1 (|i − j| ≥ 2),
             (tsi )2 = 1 (2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1),       (ts1 )4 = 1.

Hk is isomorphic to the Weyl group of type Bk or Ck , and is also sometimes
called the group of signed permutations. The subgroup of Hk generated by the si ,
1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, is isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree k, which we denote
by Sk .
B. Partitions.
     `            Let Pk denote the set of all partitions of k (see [8, p. 1]), and put
P = k≥0 Pk . For λ ∈ P , we write l(λ) for the length of λ, namely the number of
nonzero parts of λ. Also we write |λ| = k if λ ∈ Pk . Let DPk and OPk denote the
distinct partitions (or strict partitions, namely partitions whose parts are distinct)
and the odd partitions (namely partitions whose parts are all odd) of k respectively.
Let DPk+ and DPk− be the sets of all λ ∈ DPk such that (−1)k−l(λ) = +1 and −1
respectively. Note that (−1)k−l(λ)
                                ` equals the signature   `of permutations with cycle
type λ. We also put DP = k≥0 DPk and OP = k≥0 OPk . Note that these
notations, DP and OP , were used by Stembridge in [12], [13].
C. The subring Ω of the ring of the symmetric functions. Let Λ denote the
ring of the symmetric functions with coefficients in C. Note that our          LΛ is the scalar
extension of the Λ in [8], which is a Z-algebra, to C. We have Λ = k≥0 Λk , where
Λk denotes the subspace of Λ consisting of the homogeneous elements of degree k.
                                                                 P
   For each r ≥ 1, let pr denote the r-th power sum i≥1 xri ∈ Λ. The pr , r ≥ 1,
are algebraically independent over C and we have Λ = C[p1 , p2 , . . . ]. For each
partition λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λl ) ∈ P , let pλ = pλ1 pλ2 · · · pλl . Then {pλ ; λ ∈ P } is a
basis of Λ (cf. [8, §I, sect. 2.]).

   Let Ω denote the subring of Λ generated by the power sums of oddLdegrees,
namely the pr , r = 1, 3, 5, . . . . Put Ωk = Ω ∩ Λk . Then we have Ω = k≥0 Ωk ,
and {pλ | λ ∈ OP } is a basis of Ω.
   For λ ∈ DP , let Qλ ∈ Λ denote Schur’s Q-function indexed by λ (cf. [10], [12,
sect. 6]). Then {Qλ | λ ∈ DP } is also a basis of Ω.
D. Twisted group algebras Ak and Bk . For each k ≥ 1, let Ak denote the
associative algebra generated by the elements γi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, subject to relations

(1.2)       γi2 = −1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1), (γi γi+1 )3 = −1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2),
            (γi γj )2 = −1 (|i − j| ≥ 2).

Ak is isomorphic to a twisted group algebra of Sk (see below). We regard Ak as a
Z2 -graded algebra by giving degree 1 ∈ Z2 to the generators γi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
In the following, we abbreviate Z/2Z as Z2 .
   For each k ≥ 1, let Bk denote the associative algebra generated by τ and the σi ,
1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, subject to relations

(1.3)
         τ 2 = σi2 = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1),        (σi σi+1 )3 = 1   (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2),
               2                                2
         (σi σj ) = 1 (|i − j| ≥ 2),      (τ σi ) = 1     (2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1),
         (τ σ1 )4 = −1.

Bk is isomorphic to a twisted group algebra of Hk (again see below). We regard
Bk as a Z2 -graded algebra by giving degree 1 to the generator τ and degree 0 to
the generator σi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
Remark. The structures of H 2 (Sk , C× ) and H 2 (Hk , C× ) were clarified by I. Schur
[10] and J. W. Davies, A. O. Morris [1] respectively, as follows:

If k ≥ 4, then any twisted group algebra Cα Sk of Sk with a non-trivial 2-cocycle
α is isomorphic to Ak (cf. [10], [12, Lem. 1.1]).
                                            √ If k ≤ 3, then Ak is isomorphic to
the ordinary group algebra CSk , via γi 7→ −1si .
   Moreover, if k ≥ 2, then Bk is isomorphic to a twisted group algebra Cα Hk
of Hk with a non-trivial 2-cocycle α (cf. [13, Prop. 1.1]). Note that the cocycle
associated with Bk does not restrict to the cocycle associated with Ak .

   In the following, we consistently use the formulation of the Z2 -graded represen-
tations, namely the Z2 -graded modules of Z2 -graded algebras (superalgebras), as
was used in [3] and [4]. This formulation is slightly different from the traditional
parametrization of the non-graded representations, but there exists a explicit re-
lation between the Z2 -graded representations of a Z2 -graded algebra A and the
non-graded representations of the underlying algebra |A| (cf. [3, Lem. (2.8), Cor.
(2.16), Prop. (2.17)], [4, Prop. 2.5, Cor. 2.6]).
E. Semisimple superalgebras. This theory was developed by T. Józefiak in [3],
which we mostly follow. A Z2 -graded algebra A, which is called a superalgebra
in this paper, is called simple if it has no Z2 -graded two-sided ideals except itself
and 0.
   Let V be a Z2 -graded vector space, namely a vector space with a fixed direct
sum decomposition V = V0 ⊕ V1 . We write dim V for the pair (dim V0 , dim V1 ). If
W = W0 ⊕W1 is another Z2 -graded vector space, then the vector space Hom(V, W )
consisting of all linear maps from V to W has a Z2 -gradation defined as follows:

         Homα (V, W ) = {f ∈ Hom(V, W ) ; f (Vβ ) ⊂ Wα+β for all β ∈ Z2 }

for each α ∈ Z2 . In particular, it can be easily checked that the endomorphism
algebra End(V ) = Hom(V, V ), which is isomorphic to the full matrix ring Mn+m
where dim V = (n, m), can be regarded as a superalgebra with this gradation.
This superalgebra is denoted by M (n, m). It is clear that M (n, m) is simple, since
the underlying algebra |M (n, m)| = Mn+m is a simple algebra.
   There exist another type of simple superalgebras. Let Q(n) denote asubsuper-  
                                                                          C D
algebra of M (n, n) which consists of all 2n × 2n-matrices of the form              ,
                                                                          D C
where C and D are n × n-matrices. It is easy to show that Q(n) is a simple
superalgebra.
Theorem 1.1. (cf. [3, Th. 2.6], [4, Th. 2.1], [15]) A simple superalgebra is isomor-
phic to either M (n, m) for some n, m or Q(n) for some n.
   A simple superalgebra A is said to be of type M (resp. of type Q) if A is
isomorphic to M (n, m) for some n, m (resp. is isomorphic to Q(n) for some n).
   Let V be an A-module, namely a Z2 -graded vector space V = V0 ⊕ V1 together
with an algebra homomorphism ρ : A → End(V ), which preserves Z2 -gradations.
Then we call ρ a representation of A in V , and simply write ρ(a)v = av for all
a ∈ A and v ∈ V . A Z2 -graded subspace W of V is called an A-submodule if it
is stable under ρ(A). We say that V is simple if it has no A-submodules except
itself and 0.
   Let V and W be two A-modules. For each α ∈ Z2 , let Homα       A (V, W ) denote
the subspace of Homα (V, W ) consisting of all elements f ∈ Homα (V, W ) such that
f (av) = (−1)α·β af (v) for all a ∈ Aβ (β ∈ Z2 ), v ∈ V . Put Hom·A (V, W ) =
Hom0A (V, W ) ⊕ Hom1A (V, W ) and put End·A (V ) = Hom·A (V, V ). It is clear that
End·A (V ) is a subsuperalgebra of End(V ) with this gradation. We call End·A (V )
the supercentralizer of ρ(A) or A in End(V ), where ρ is the representation of A

associated with V . The shift of V , denoted by V in this paper, is defined to be the
same vector space as V with the switched grading, namely V 0 = V1 and V 1 = V0 ,
and with the homomorphism ρ : A → End(V ) defined by ρ(a) = (−1)α ρ(a) for
a ∈ Aα , where ρ is the superalgebra homomorphism associated with V . Note that
we have Hom0A (V , W ) = Hom1A (V, W ) and Hom1A (V , W ) = Hom0A (V, W ). Two
A-modules V and W are called isomorphic (resp. strictly isomorphic) if there
exists an invertible linear map f ∈ Hom·A (V, W ) (resp. f ∈ Hom0A (V, W )). If this
                                         .
is the case, we write V ∼=A W (resp. V ∼ =A W ). In view of the following .theorem,
if V. and W are simple A-modules, we have V ∼    =A W if and only if V ∼   =A W or
   ∼
V =A W .
    The following theorem contains an analogue of Schur’s Lemma.
Theorem 1.2. (cf. [3, Prop. 2.17], [4, Prop. 2.5, Cor. 2.6]) Let V = V0 ⊕ V1 be a
simple A-module.
   (1) The supercentralizer End·A (V ) is isomorphic to M (1, 0) ∼
                                                                 = C, if and only if
V0 is not isomorphic to V1 as an A0 -module.

   (2) The supercentralizer End·A (V ) is isomorphic to Q(1) ∼
                                                             = C1 , if and only if V0
is isomorphic to V1 as an A0 -module.
   If a simple A-module V satisfies either of the equivalent conditions in (1) (resp.
(2)), then we say that it is of type M (resp. of type Q). If V is a simple A-module
                                            .
of type M , then so is V and we .have V ∼  6=A V . If V is a simple A-module of type
Q, then so is V and we have V ∼   =A V . In both cases we have V ∼  =A V .
   Let A and B be two superalgebras and let V (resp. W ) be an A (resp. B)-module.
The vector space A ⊗ B can be turned into a superalgebra, where the grading is
defined by (A ⊗ B)α = ⊕β+γ=α Aβ ⊗ Bγ for each α ∈ Z2 , and the multiplication is
defined by
                           (a ⊗ b)(c ⊗ d) = (−1)β·γ ac ⊗ bd

for any a ∈ A, b ∈ Bβ , c ∈ Aγ , and d ∈ B (β, γ ∈ Z2 ). This superalgebra is
                                                                     .

We call a superalgebra A semisimple if it satisfies one of the above equivalent con-
ditions (1)-(3). Note that the supertensor product of two semisimple superalgebras
is semisimple.
Theorem 1.6. (cf. [3, Cor. 2.12], [4, Th. 2.2, Cor. 2.3]) Let A be a semisimple su-
peralgebra.
   (1) There exist integers m, q ≥ 0 and ki , li ≥ 0 (1 ≤ i ≤ m) and nj ≥ 0
(1 ≤ j ≤ q) such that
                              M m                q
                                                 M

                                  i=1              j=1

as a superalgebra. The following data are determined by A, and conversely the
following data determine A: (a) m = m(A), (b) q = q(A), (c) the multiset of the
unordered pairs {ki , li }, and (d) the multiset of the numbers nj .
   (2) The number of the isomorphism classes of the simple A-modules is equal to
m(A) + q(A).
   Note that the set of simple direct summands of A, isomorphic to M (ki , li ) (1 ≤
i ≤ m) and Q(nj ) (1 ≤ j ≤ q), is uniquely determined by A. We call them
the simple components of A. We should also remark the equivalence of the
semisimplicity of a superalgebra to that of the underlying algebra:
Proposition 1.7. (cf. [3, Cor. 2.16]) A superalgebra A is semisimple if and only
if an underlying algebra |A| is semisimple.
   Let A be a semisimple superalgebra, and let V be an A-module. Then there
exist a finite number of simple A-submodules U1 , U2 , . . . , Ul of V such
                                                                         P that V =
U1 ⊕ U2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ul as an A-module. For each 1 ≤ r ≤ l, put U (V  Lr) =       = A U r Vs .
                                                                            Us ∼
Then we can choose a subset R of {1, 2, . . . , l} such that V = r∈R U (V )r . Note
that the set of A-submodules U (V )r , r ∈ R, is uniquely determined by V . The
U (V )r are called the A-homogeneous components of V .
   In the next section, §2, we will precisely state the double centralizer theorem for
semisimple superalgebras, in which we will show that there exists a 1−1 correspon-
dence between the simple A-modules and the simple End·A (V )-modules appearing
in an A-module V .
F. Character formulas for Ak and Bk . Let A be a superalgebra: A = A0 ⊕ A1 ,
and let V be an A-module. Define a linear map Ch[V ] : A → C by Ch[V ](a) =
trV (a) for all a ∈ A. It is called the character of the A-module V . Ch[V ] only
depends on the isomorphism class of V . We also say that V affords the character
Ch[V ]. Let {Ur }r∈R be a complete set of representatives of the isomorphism classes
of the simple A-modules. Let Z0 (A∗ ) denote the subspace of A∗ = Hom(A, C)
consisting of all elements f : A → C such that f (ab) = f (ba) for all a, b ∈ A
and such that f |A1 = 0. The character of any A-module belongs to Z0 (A∗ ). If
A is semisimple, then {Ch[Ur ] ; r ∈ R} is a basis of Z0 (A∗ ). In this case, the
isomorphism classes of A-modules are uniquely determined by their characters.
   Let S′k be the subgroup of (Ak )× generated by −1, γ1 , . . . , γk−1 (−1 is not
necessary if k ≥ 4). Then S′k is a double cover (a central extension with a Z2

kernel) of Sk with a group homomorphism π : S′k → Sk defined by π(−1) = 1 and
π(γj ) = sj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1. If k ≥ 4, then S′k is a representation group of Sk .
Let γ µ be an element of S′k defined by taking a particular reduced expression of a
permutation of cycle type µ and replacing each si with γi , namely:
    γ µ = (γ1 · · · γµ1 −1 )(γµ1 +1 · · · γµ1 +µ2 −1 ) · · · (γµ1 +···+µr−1 +1 · · · γµ1 +···+µr −1 )
where r = l(µ). Let ϕ be a character of an Ak -module. Then we have ϕ(γ µ ) = 0
unless µ ∈ OPk (cf. [10], [12]). I. Schur explicitly described the characters of the
simple Ak -modules. We review Schur’s result in the form translated by T. Józefiak
into the language of Z2 -graded representations [4]. Let ε : DPk → Z2 be defined
by ε(ν) = 0 if ν ∈ DPk+ and ε(ν) = 1 if ν ∈ DPk− .

ϕν , ν ∈ DPk , give all irreducible characters of Ak .
   For each ν ∈ DPk , fix a simple Ak -module Vν which affords the irreducible
character ϕν of Ak . Then Vν is of type M (resp. type Q) if ν ∈ DPk+ (resp.
ν ∈ DPk− ).
    Let Hk′ be the subgroup of (Bk )× generated by −1, τ , σ1 , . . . , σk−1 (−1 is not
necessary if k ≥ 2). Then Hk′ is a double cover of Hk with a group homomorphism
π : Hk′ → Hk defined by π(−1) = 1, π(τ ) = t, and π(σj ) = sj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1.
Let σ (λ,µ) denote a similarly defined element of Hk′ mapping to a representative of
the conjugacy class of Hk indexed by (λ, µ):
                σ (λ,µ) = x1 x2 · · · y1 y2 · · · ,
                xi = σλ1 +···+λi−1 +1 · · · σλ1 +···+λi −1 ,

                τj = σj−1 · · · σ1 τ σ1 · · · σj−1 .

Let ψ be a character of a Bk -module. Then we have ψ(σ (λ,µ) ) = 0 unless λ ∈ OPk
and µ = φ (cf. [1], [13]). A. N. Sergeev showed the following explicit formula for
the characters of the simple Bk -modules using his duality relation which we will
review in the next subsection, §1, G. Define a map d : Pk → Z2 by d(ν) = 1 if l(ν)
is odd, and d(ν) = 0 if l(ν) is even.
Theorem 1.9. Define the functions ψν ∈ Z0 ((Bk )∗ ), ν ∈ DPk , by

for all µ ∈ OPk . Then the ψν , ν ∈ DPk , give all irreducible characters of Bk .
   For each ν ∈ DPk , fix a simple Bk -module Wν which affords the character ψν .
Then Wν is of type M (resp. type Q) if l(ν) is even (resp. odd).

G. Sergeev’s duality relation. First we introduce the Lie superalgebra q(n),
sometimes called the queer Lie superalgebra. A standard reference for Lie super-
algebras is [7].
   Let gl(n/m) (denoted by l(n, m) in [7]) denote the Lie superalgebra whose un-
derlying vector space is that of (the superalgebra) M (n, m) and the Jacobi product
[ , ] : gl(n/m) × gl(n/m) → gl(n/m) is defined by [X, Y ] = XY − (−1)α·β Y X for
all X ∈ gl(n/m)α and Y ∈ gl(n/m)β (α, β ∈ Z2 ). Let q(n) denote the Lie super-
algebra for the superalgebra Q(n) in the same manner. Let Un = U(q(n)) denote
the universal enveloping algebra of q(n), which can be regarded as a superalgebra
(cf. [7]).
   The Lie superalgebra q(n) naturally acts on a 2n-dimensional space V with a
fixed Z2 -gradation V = V0 ⊕ V1 , dim V0 = dim V1 = n. Therefore
                                                              .

V . Let W denote the k-fold supertensor product W = V           of V . We define a
representation Θ : Un → End(W ) by
                                  k                                           j

for all X ∈ q(n)α and vi ∈ Vβi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) and α, βi ∈ Z2 (1 ≤ i ≤ k). Actually
                                                                          .
this action can be defined using a superalgebra homomorphism
                                                  .       .
                                                              ∆ : Un → Un ⊗ Un
called the coproduct, determined by ∆(X) = 1 ⊗ X + X ⊗ 1 for all X ∈ q(n).

Namely, if we put ∆(k) = (id ⊗ · · · ⊗ id ⊗∆) ◦ · · · ◦ (id ⊗ ∆) ◦ ∆ : Un → Un⊗k , then
                   .     .                   .       .
we have Θ(X)(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vk ) = ∆(k) (X)(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vk ). Note that Un is an infinite
dimensional superalgebra. However, for a fixed number k, Un acts on W through
its finite dimensional image in End(W ). Therefore we can use the results in §1, E
on finite dimensional superalgebras and their finite dimensional modules.

    Let W ′ be a Un -submodule of W . Since q(n)0 ∼       = gl(n, C) as a Lie algebra, and V
is a sum of two copies of natural representations of gl(n, C) (V0 and V1 ), this embeds
W ′ |q(n)0 into a sum of tensor powers of the natural representation, so that this
representation of gl(n, C) can be integrated to a polynomial representation θW ′ of
GL(n, C). Let Ch[W ′ ] denote the character of θW ′ , namely Ch[W ′ ](x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )
is the trace of θW ′ (diag(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )).
    We review Sergeev’s result. He established a duality relation between Bk and
Un using the double centralizer theorem for semisimple superalgebras, which we
will precisely state in the next section, §2.

percentralizers of each other:

        2. Double centralizer theorem for semisimple superalgebras
   Now we introduce the double supercentralizer theorem for semisimple superalge-
bras. Although this follows easily from the discussion as in [3], it seems convenient
to state it precisely. Here we partly take a finer viewpoint of strict isomorphisms.
Theorem 2.1. Let A be a semisimple superalgebra. Let V be an A-module with
the associated representation ρ : A → End(V ), and

(2.1)                              V = V1 ⊕ V2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vs

be the decomposition of V into A-homogeneous components. Put B = End·A (V ).

We define a representation ρ̃ : A ⊗ B → End(V ) of A ⊗ B by ρ̃(a ⊗ b) = ρ(a) ◦ b
                                                                 .
for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Then each Vi , 1 ≤ i ≤ s, is a simple A ⊗ B-submodule of
V of type M .
   Let Ui be a simple A-module contained in Vi . If Ui is of type M , then there
exists a simple B-module Wi of type M such that
                               .       .         .     .
                            Ui ⊗ Wi ∼
                                    =A⊗B
                                      .  Ui ⊗ W i ∼
                                                  =A⊗B
                                                    .  Vi .

     If Ui is of type Q, then there exists a simple B-module Wi of type Q such that
                                       .    .
                                   Ui ⊗ Wi ∼

We have

for all 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ s. This gives a 1 − 1 correspondence between the isomorphism
classes of simple A-modules and simple B-modules appearing in V . Furthermore,
we have End·B (V ) = ρ(A).
Proof. Put Wi = Hom·A (Ui , Vi ) for each i. Since b(Vi ) ⊂ Vi for any b ∈ B, one can
define a representation χi : B → End· (Wi ) by (χi (b)w)(u) = b(w(u)) for all b ∈ B,
w ∈ Wi , and u ∈ Ui . Then Wi is a simple B-module. In fact, let Wi′ ⊂ Wi be
a nonzero B-submodule. Since Wi′ is homogeneous, there is a homogeneous φ ∈
Wi′ −{0}, which can be regarded as an isomorphism onto φ(Ui ). Let φ′ : φ(Ui ) → Ui
be its inverse. Also Vi = φ(Ui ) ⊕ Vi′ for some A-submodule Vi′ . Let ψ be any
homogeneous element of Wi . Define b ∈ B by b|φ(Ui ) = ψ ◦ φ′ and b|Vi′ = 0,
whence ψ = bφ ∈ Wi′ . Thus Wi′ contains all homogeneous elements of Wi , so that
Wi′ = Wi .

   If Ui is of type M (resp. type Q) and Vi ∼  =A Ui i ⊕ U i i (resp. Vi ∼       =A U ⊕ni ),
then by Theorem 1.2 we have End·A (Vi ) ∼     = M (ki′ , li′ ) (resp. End·A (Vi ) ∼
                                                                                  = Q(n′i )).
                              ·            ·
Since χi decomposes as EndA (V ) → EndA (Vi ) → End(Wi ), the first part being a
surjection and End·A (Vi ) being a simple superalgebra, we have χi (B) ∼      = End·A (Vi ).
Therefore Wi is of type M (resp. type Q).

   Now Vi is a quotient of Ui ⊗Wi by an A ⊗B-homomorphism u ⊗w → (−1)αβ w(u)
for u ∈ (Ui )α and w ∈ (Wi )β . If Ui and Wi are of type M , then by Theorem 1.4
    .                    .                         .               .
Ui ⊗ Wi is a simple A ⊗ B-module, so that Vi ∼    =A⊗B   .     Ui ⊗ Wi . Next suppose Ui
and Wi are of type Q. Choose xi ∈ End1A (Ui ) such that x2i = −1, and define
yi ∈ End1B (Wi ) by
                                               √
(2.2)                       (yi (w))(u) = (−1)α −1w(xi (u))

for all w ∈ (Wi )α and u ∈ Ui . Then yi2 = −1. By Theorem 1.4 and a comparison

respect to xi ⊗ yi . Direct computation shows that the former is the case.
   Consequently we have

where

        dim Ui = (ki , li ), dim Wi = (ki′ , li′ )       if Ui and Wi are of type M ,
        dim Ui = (ni , ni ), dim Wi = (n′i , n′i )       if Ui and Wi are of type Q.

In particular, the B-modules Wi are mutually nonisomorphic. Therefore (2.1)
can also be regarded as the decomposition of V into.
                                                     B-homogeneous components.

Starting with this and appropriately identifying A ⊗B-modules with B ⊗A-modules
as noted in §1, E, we can see that End·B (V ) = ρ(A). 

   Note that , in (2.3), the signature in (Ui ⊗ Wi )+ is always + so long as yi is
constructed from xi by (2.2) regardless of the choice of xi . The above theorem gives
a supercommuting action of two superalgebras

into a multiplicity-free sum of simple A ⊗ B-modules, where type M (resp. type Q)
simple A-modules are paired with type M (resp. type Q) simple B-modules in a
bijective manner. Later we also encounter a similar but slightly different situation,
in which type M (resp. type Q) simple A-modules are paired with type Q (resp.
type M ) simple B-modules. Here we formulate this as the following corollary. Note
                                                                               2

   Furthermore, we have End·A (V ) = B ⊗ C and End·B (V ) = ρ(A) ⊗ C.
Proof.
   .
       From Theorem 2.1, V is decomposed as a multiplicity-free sum of simple
A′ ⊗ B-modules as follows:
                    .      M       .      M        .

                                 type M                 type Q

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the Ui , 1 ≤ i ≤ m, are of type M
and the Uj , m + 1 ≤ j ≤ s, are of type Q for some m ≤ s.
   We use Theorem 1.4 for A and C, noting that C has a unique simple module X
of dimension 2, which is of type Q. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we are in case (c). This implies
ki = li , and that Ti = Ui |A is a simple A-module of type Q. Also by Corollary 1.5
the Ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ m, are. all mutually nonisomorphic. For m + 1 ≤ i ≤ s, we are
                                          .
in case (b). Hence Ui ∼         =A′ Ti ⊗ X for some simple A-module Ti of type M with        .
dimention (ki′′ , li′′ ) for some ki′′ and li′′ summing up to ni . We can use xi = idVi ⊗ z,
with z ∈ End1C (X) satisfying z 2 = −1, for the xi required in the proof of Theorem
                   .                  .       .                    .           .
2.1. Then (Ui ⊗ Wi )+ = Ti ⊗ (X ⊗ Wi )+ . Since (X ⊗ Wi )+ |B ∼                = B Wi , we have

and this decomposition coincides with that into the Vi in the statement. This
establishes a 1 − 1 correspondence between the simple A-modules of type Q (resp.

Comparing the dimensions, we see that C ⊗ B gives the whole End·A (V ). 
Remark. The assumption in the above corollary is actually equivalent to the exis-
tence of an invertible element in End1A (V ). In fact, the latter means the existence
of an invertible element of degree 1 in each simple component of End1A (V ), which is
equivalent to assuming ki′ = li′ for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m in the decomposition of Theorem
2.1 applied for A and End·A (V ) (not for A′ and B). If this is the case, End1A (V )
clearly contains an element x′ satisfying (x′ )2 = 1, whence an element x satisfying
x2 = −1 also. The other direction is clear since such x is invertible.

                     3. A simple relation between Ak and Bk
   Let Ck denote the 2k -dimensional Clifford algebra, namely Ck is an associative
algebra generated by k elements ξ1 , . . . , ξk subject to relations
(3.1)                           ξi2 = 1,      ξi ξj = −ξj ξi           (i 6= j) .
We regard Ck as a superalgebra by giving degree 1 to the generator ξi for all
1 ≤ i ≤ k. For any subset I = {i1 < i2 < · · · < ir } of [k] = {1, 2, . . . , k}, we write
ξI = ξi1 ξi2 · · · ξir . Then {ξI ; I ⊂ [k]} is a basis of Ck . Note that Ck is isomorphic
to a twisted group algebra of Zk2 and therefore it is semisimple. Furthermore, it is
easy to show that Ck is a simple superalgebra. If k is even (resp. odd), then Ck is
of type M (resp. of type Q). Put r = ⌊k/2⌋. Define a Z2 -graded simple Ck -module
Xk as a minimal left superideal (namely a minimal Z2 -graded left ideal) of Ck as
follows:
(3.2)                  Xk = Ck e,

                       e = e1 e2 · · · er ,       ei = √ (1 + −1ξ2i−1 ξ2i ).
                                                        2
For each ε = (ε1 , . . . , εr ) ∈ Zr2 , put ξ ε = (ξ1ε1 e1 )(ξ3ε2 e2 ) · · · (ξ2r−1
                                                                               εr

(resp. odd), then {ξ ; ε ∈ Z2 } (resp. {ξ ; ε ∈ Z2 } ∪ {ξ ξk ; ε ∈ Zr2 }) is a basis of
                       ε          r             ε          r          ε

                                zk (ξ ε ξkα ) = (−1)       i   εi +α

for all ε = (ε1 , . . . , εr ) ∈ Zr2 and α ∈ Z2 . Note that zk2 = −1.
Proposition 3.1. (cf. [12, Prop. 3.1]) The character value of the simple Ck -module
Xk is given by                            !
                                X

for any element        I cI ξI ∈ Ck , with cI ∈ C for all I ⊂ [k].
   The following isomorphism is the key to our clarification of the relation between
the simple modules over Ak and Bk .
                                                                                      .

isfying

isomorphism.

for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1.
   It is easy to check that the τi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and the γ̃j , 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1, satisfy the
relations (3.1) and (1.2) in which ξi and γj are replaced by τi and γ̃j respectively.
Furthermore, we have τi γ̃j = −γ̃j τi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1, since
                                   
                                    −(τj − τj+1 )τi+1 if i = j,

  The following proposition shows that our parametrization of the simple Bk -

where (Xk ⊗ Vν )± are as in Proposition 3.3. The Wν , ν ∈ DPk , form a complete
set of (not strict) isomorphism classes of simple Bk -module.

Therefore (4.1) follows.
                       .
  Since W ε is an Ak ⊗ Un -module, we have

                                Θ(Un )|W ε ⊂ End·Ψ(Ak ) (W ε ).

Define a linear map pε : Θ(Un ) → Θ(Un )|W ε by pε (f ) = f |W ε for all f ∈ Θ(Un ). We
claim that pε is injective. Assume that f ∈ ker pε , namely pε (f ) = 0 ∈ End(W ε ).
Since f and ξ2j−1 ’s commute, and a subgroup of (Ck )× generated by the ξ2j−1 ,
                                   ′
1 ≤ j ≤ r, transitively act on {W ε ; ε′ ∈ Zr2 } as follows:

                         ξ2j−1 W (ε1 ,...,εr ) = W (ε1 ,...,εj +1,...,εr )

for all 1 ≤ j ≤ r, it follows that f |W ε′ = 0 for all ε′ ∈ Zr2 . Therefore f = 0 in
End(W ), as required. Hence pε is injective.
   From Theorem 1.10, Theorem 2.1, and (4.1), we have

      dim End·Ψ(Ak ) (W ε ) = dim End·Ψ(Bk ) (W ) = dim Θ(Un ) = dim Θ(Un )|W ε .

Consequently we have
                                End·Ψ(Ak ) (W ε ) = Θ(Un )|W ε

for each ε ∈ Zr2 and α ∈ Z2 . Then it is clear that (Xkε ⊗ Uν )+ is a Un -module for

(c) we have

Therefore (4.3) follows. From Corollary 2.2, (4,4) follows.                               
Corollary 4.2. The duality relation of Ak and Un in Theorem 4.1 gives Schur’s
formula (1.6). Namely we get Schur’s formula (1.6) by the calculation of the char-
                .
acter of the Ak ⊗ Un -module W ε in Theorem 4.1.
                                                                              .
Proof. By what we noted before Theorem 1.10, any Ak ⊗ Un -submodule W ′ of W
can be regarded as an Ak -module with a commuting polynomial representation
θW ′ of GL(n, C). Here we extend our notation in Theorem 1.10 to let Ch[W ′ ] ∈
Z0 ((Ak ⊗ C[GL(n, C)]∗ ) be determined by x ⊗ g 7→ tr(xW ′ ◦ θW ′ (g)) for x ∈ Ak
and g ∈ GL(n, C), where xW ′ denotes the action of x ∈ Ak on W ′ .
                                                        ′                  ′
   For any ε, ε′ ∈ Zr2 , we have Ch[W ε ] = Ch[W ε ], since W ε ∼     = W ε . Then, we
have Ch[W ] = 2r Ch[W ε ] for any ε ∈ Zr2 . Therefore, for each µ ∈ OPk and each
diagonal element E = diag (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈ GL(n, C), we have
                                                    .          
                 Ch[W ε ] (γ µ ⊗ E) = 2−r Ch[W ] ϑ(1 ⊗ γ µ ) ⊗ E .

                          .                                                           .
Put l = l(µ). Since 1 ⊗ γ µ is a product of k − l elements 1 ⊗ γj , its image under ϑ
is a product of k − l elements of Bk of the form √12 (τj − τj+1 )σj . Rearrange this
product into the form

            (constant) × (product of the τr − τs ) × (product of the σj ).

The product of the σj equals σ (µ,φ) . Expanding the product of τr − τs into a sum
of k − l elements, we have
                                       k−l
                  .
                      µ            1                 X
             ϑ(1 ⊗ γ ) =          √              ×        (product of the τr ) × σ (µ,φ) .

Then all terms in the summation are conjugate to σ (µ,φ) in (Bk )× . Therefore we
have
                                          √                               

On the other hand, using (1.10), if k is even, then we have

and if k is odd, then we have

Consequently the result follows.               
