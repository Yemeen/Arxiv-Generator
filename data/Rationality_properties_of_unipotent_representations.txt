                                             0.1. Let k be an algebraic closure of a finite field Fq with q elements. Let G be
                                             a connected simple algebraic group of adjoint type over k with a fixed Fq -rational
                                             structure; let F : G −→ G be the corresponding Frobenius map. The fixed point
                                                   F
                                             set G is a finite group. Let W be the Weyl group of G. For w ∈ W let Rw be
                                             the character of the virtual representation R1 (w) of GF defined in [DL, 1.5]. (The
                                             definition of Rw is in terms of l-adic cohomology but in fact Rw has integer values
                                             and is independent of l, see [DL, 3.3].) An irreducible representation ρ of GF over
                                             C is said to be unipotent if its character χρ : GF −
                                                                                                → C occurs with 6= 0 multiplicity
                                             in Rw for some w ∈ W (see [DL, 7.8]). Let U be the set of isomorphism classes
                                             of unipotent representations of GF . Let ŨQ = {ρ ∈ U|χρ (g) ∈ Q ∀g ∈ GF }. Let
                                             UQ be the set of all ρ ∈ U such that ρ is defined over Q (that is, it can be realized
                                             by a Q[GF ]-module). We have UQ ⊂ ŨQ ⊂ U.
                                                Unless otherwise specified, we assume that G is split over Fq . The following is
                                             one of our results.
                                             Theorem 0.2. We have UQ = ŨQ .
                                             0.3. We will also show (see 1.12) that, if G is of type A, B, C or D, then UQ =
                                             U. (The analogous statement is false for exceptional types.) The rationality of
                                             certain unipotent cuspidal representations connected with Coxeter elements has
                                             been proved in [L1]. The method of [L1] has been extended in [L3] (unpublished)
                                             to determine explicitly UQ in the general case (including non-split groups). The
                                             case where G is non-split of type A has been also considered by Ohmori [Oh] by
                                             another extension of the method of [L1].
                                                Our study of rationality of unipotent representations is based on the statement
                                             that a given unipotent representation appears with multiplicity 1 in some (possi-
                                             bly virtual) representation R defined using l-adic cohomology and then using the
                                             Hasse principle. In the first method (that of [L3]), R is a particular intersection
                                             cohomology space of a variety; see Sec.1. In the second method (which applies

only in the cuspidal case), R will be one of the Rw above; see Sec.2. In one case
(G = SO5 with q odd), we give an elementary approach to rationality (without
using the Hasse principle); see Sec.3.

                                 1. First method
1.1. Let p be the characteristic of Fq . For any prime number l 6= p, we choose an
imbedding of the field Ql , the l-adic numbers, into C. This allows us to regard
any representation of GF over Ql as one over C. Let X be the flag manifold of
G; let F : X −  → X be the map induced by F : G −       → G. For w ∈ W let Ow
be the set of all (B, B ′ ) ∈ X × X that are in relative position w. As in [DL],
for any w ∈ W , let Xw be the subvariety of X consisting of all B ∈ X such that
(B, F (B)) ∈ Ow ; let X̄w be the closure of Xw in X. Then Xw , X̄w are stable under
the conjugation action of GF on X. Hence for any j ∈ Z there is an induced action
of GF on the l-adic cohomology with compact support Hcj (Xw , Ql ) and on the l-
adic intersection cohomology Hj (X̄w , Ql ). (Note that X̄w has pure dimension l(w)
where l : W − → N is theP length function.) Recall that Rw is the character of the
virtual representation j∈Z (−1)j Hcj (Xw , Ql ) of GF .
Lemma 1.2. Let ρ ∈ U. There exists x ∈ W and j ∈ [0, l(x)] such that ρ appears
with multiplicity 1 in the GF -module Hj (X̄x , Ql ).
   The proof is based on results of [L2]. For any x ∈ W let Ax be the virtual
representation of W defined  P in [L2, p.154,156]. For any virtual representationF E
                         −1
of W we set RE = |W |          w∈W tr(w, E)Rw . (A Q-valued class function on G .)
Thus, RAx is defined. Let a : W −   → N be as in [L2, p.178]. Assume that
   (a) x ∈ W is such that ρ appears with multiplicity 1 in (−1)l(x)−a(x) RAx .
Then from [L2, 6.15, 6.17(i), 5.13(i)] we deduce that ρ appears with multiplicity
1 in Hl(x)−a(x) (X̄x , Ql ). (Actually, in the references given, q is assumed to be
sufficiently large; but this assumption is removed later in [L2].) Thus, to prove
the lemma it is enough to show that (a) holds for some x ∈ W . Now in [L2],
the multiplicities of any unipotent representation in (−1)l(x)−a(x) RAx have been
explicitly described for many x. (See for example the tables in [L2, p.304-306] for
types E8 , F4 and the results in [L2, Ch.9] for classical types.) In particular, we see
that (a) holds for some x ∈ W .
Lemma 1.3. Let ρ ∈ ŨQ . Let l be a prime number invertible in k. Let x, j be as
in 1.2.
   (a) ρ is defined over Ql .
   (b) If j is even then ρ is defined over R. If j is odd then ρ is not defined over
R.
   (c) If j is even then ρ ∈ UQ .
   Clearly, (a) follows from 1.2. We prove (b). Let c ∈ H 2 (X̄w , Ql ) be the Chern
class of an ample line bundle on X̄w (we ignore Tate twists); we may assume
that this line bundle is the restriction of a line bundle on X. Since GF acts
          RATIONALITY PROPERTIES OF UNIPOTENT REPRESENTATIONS                           3

trivially on H 2 (X, Ql ) it follows that c is GF -stable. Hence the map Hj (X̄x , Ql ) −
                                                                                        →
   2l(x)−j                             l(x)−j                             F
H          (X̄x , Ql ) given by ξ 7→ c        ξ is compatible with the G -action. This
map is an isomorphism, by the Hard Lefschetz Theorem [BBD, 5.4.10]. Let (, ) :
Hj (X̄x , Ql ) × H2l(x)−j (X̄x , Ql ) be the Poincaré duality pairing. (We again ignore
Tate twists.) Then ξ, ξ ′ 7→ (ξ, cl(x)−j ξ ′ ) is a (−1)j -symmetric, non-singular, GF -
invariant bilinear form Hj (X̄x , Ql ) × Hj (X̄x , Ql ) → Ql . This restricts to a (−1)j -
symmetric, GF -invariant bilinear form on the ρ-isotypic part of Hj (X̄x , Ql ), which
is non-singular, since ρ is isomorphic to its dual (recall that ρ ∈ ŨQ ). This ρ-
isotypic part is isomorphic to ρ and (b) follows. Under the assumption of (c), we
see from (a),(b), using the Hasse principle for division algebras with centre Q that
ρ is defined over Q. (The Hasse principle is applicable even when information is
missing at one place, in our case at p-adic numbers.) The lemma is proved.
Lemma 1.4. Let ρ ∈ ŨQ . Let x, j be as in 1.2. Then j is even.
   It is known [L2] that the parity of an integer j such that ρ appears with non-zero
multiplicity in Hj (X̄x , Ql ) for some x ∈ W is an invariant of ρ. Moreover, j is even
except if G is of type E7 and ρ is one the two unipotent cuspidal representations
or G is of type E8 and ρ is a component of the representation induced by one of
the two unipotent cuspidal representations of a parabolic of type E7 . (See [L2,
Ch.11].) In these exceptional cases, we have ρ ∈   / ŨQ , as one sees using [L2, 11.2].
The lemma is proved.
1.5. Now Theorem 0.2 follows immediately from 1.3(c) and 1.4.
1.6. Let X be the set of all triples (F , y, σ) where F is a ”family” [L2, 4.2] of irre-
ducible representations of W (with an associated finite group GF , see [L2, Ch.4]),
y is an element of GF defined up to conjugacy and σ is an irreducible representa-
tion of the centralizer of y in GF defined up to isomorphism. For (F , y, σ) ∈ X ,
let λy,σ be the scalar by which y acts on σ (a root of 1). Let X1 be the set of all
(F , y, σ) ∈ X such that |F | =
                              6 2 and λy,σ = ±1. If q is a square, let X2 be the set
of all (F , y, σ) ∈ X such that |F | = 2, y = 1. If q is not a square, let X2 = ∅. In
any case, X2 is empty unless G is of type E7 or E8 . Let XQ = X1 ∪ X2 .
   In [L2, 4.23], X is put in a bijection

(a)                                (F , y, σ) ↔ ρF,y,σ

with U.
Lemma 1.7. Assume that ρ = ρF,y,σ , ρ′ = ρF ′ ,y′ ,σ′ where (F , y, σ) ∈ XQ ,
(F ′ , y ′ , σ ′ ) ∈ X are distinct. Then there exists x ∈ W such that ρ, ρ′ have dif-
ferent multiplicities in the GF -module (−1)l(x)−a(x) RAx .
   As mentioned in the proof of 1.2, the multiplicities of various unipotent repre-
sentations have been explicitly computed in [L2] for many x ∈ W . From this the
lemma follows easily.

Lemma 1.8. Let ρ = ρF,y,σ , where (F , y, σ) ∈ XQ . Then ρ ∈ ŨQ .
   Let γ ∈ Gal(C/Q). Then γ(χρ ) = χρ′ for some ρ′ ∈ U. Since the character of
(−1)l(x)−a(x) RAx is integer valued, it is fixed by γ. (Here x is any element of W .)
Hence ρ, ρ′ have the same multiplicity in (−1)l(x)−a(x) RAx . From 1.7 it follows
that ρ = ρ′ . Thus, γ(χρ ) = χρ for any γ ∈ Gal(C/Q), so that χρ has rational
values. The lemma is proved.
Lemma 1.9. Let ρ = ρF,y,σ , where (F , y, σ) ∈
                                             / XQ . Then ρ ∈
                                                           / ŨQ .
   Assume first that λy,σ 6= ±1. Then λy,σ ∈  / Q hence there exists γ ∈ Gal(C/Q)
such that γ(λy,σ ) 6= λy,σ . Using the interpretation of λy,σ given in [L2, 11.2], it
follows that γ(χρ ) 6= χρ . Hence ρ ∈ / ŨQ . Next assume that λy,σ = ±1. Then
|F | = 2. Moreover, if q is a square, then y 6= 1. Let σ ′ be the character of
GF = Z/2Z other than σ. Let ρ′ = ρF,y,σ′ . If y 6= 1, then by the results of
                                                                   √          √
[L1], χρ is carried to χρ′ by an element of Gal(C/Q) that takes −q to − −q.
If y = 1, then by the known construction of representations of Hecke algebras in
                                                                                 √
terms of W -graphs, χρ is carried to χρ′ by an element of Gal(C/Q) that takes q
     √
to − q. Hence again ρ ∈  / ŨQ .

Proposition 1.10. Under the bijection X ↔ U in 1.6(a), the subset ŨQ of U
corresponds to the subset XQ of X .
    This follows immediately from 1.9, 1.10.
    Combining this proposition with 0.2, we obtain:
Corollary 1.11. Under the bijection X ↔ U in 1.6(a), the subset UQ of U cor-
responds to the subset XQ of X .
   If G is of type A, B, C or D, then for any family F we have |F | =
                                                                    6 2 and the
group GF is an elementary abelian 2-group hence λy,σ = ±1 for any (F , y, σ) ∈ X .
Thus, we have XQ = X and we obtain:
Corollary 1.12. If G is of type A, B, C or D, then UQ = U.
1.13. In this subsection we assume that G is non-split. The analogues of Lemmas
1.2, 1.3 continue to hold but that of Lemma 1.4 does not. (It does in type D but
not in type A.) Also, if G is non-split of type D, then UQ = U. If G is non-split
of type A we have ŨQ = U but UQ 6= U in general.

                                2. Second method
2.1. Let n ∈ N. Let λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa be a sequence of integers such that

We define a virtual representation [λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa ] of the symmetric group Sn as
follows. If 0 ≤ λ1 < λ2 < · · · < λa , then [λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa ] is the irreducible repre-
sentation of Sn corresponding to the partition λ1 ≤ λ2 − 1 ≤ · · · ≤ λa − a + 1 of
n, as in [L2, p.81]. If λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa are in N and are distinct, then

                      [λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa ] = sgn(σ)[λσ(1), λσ(2) , . . . , λσ(a) ]

where σ is the unique permutation of 1, 2, . . . , a such that λσ(1) < λσ(2) < · · · <
λσ(a) . If λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa are not distinct, or if at least one of them is < 0, we set
[λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa ] = 0. From the definition we see easily that

                      [λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa ] = [0, λ1 + 1, λ2 + 1, . . . , λa + 1]

for any sequence of integers λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa such that (a) holds.
Lemma 2.2. Let λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa be a sequence of integers such that 2.1(a) holds.
Let w = (k)w′ ∈ Sk ×Sn−k ⊂ Sn where (k) denotes a k-cycle in Sk and w′ ∈ Sn−k .
We have
                                          a
                                          X
(a)    tr(w, [λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa ]) =         tr(w′ , [λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λi−1 , λi − k, λi+1 , . . . , λa ]).
                                          i=1


   If the λi are not distinct or if at least one of them is < 0 then both sides of (a)
are 0. We may assume that 0 ≤ λ1 < λ2 < · · · < λa . In this case, (a) can be seen
to be equivalent to Murnaghan’s rule, see [W].
2.3. For n ≥ 0 let Wn be the group of all permutations of 1, 2, . . . , n, n′ , . . . , 2′ , 1′
which commute with the involution i ↔ i′ for i = 1, . . . , n. (We have W0 = {1}.)
Given two sequences of integers λ1 , . . . , λa and µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µb such that
                                                                    

we define a virtual representation

of Wn as follows. If the λi are not distinct or if the µi are not distinct or if at least
one of the λi or µi is < 0 we define (b) to be 0. Assume now that the λi ∈ N are

satisfy r, r̃ ∈ N, r + r̃ = n. We identify Wr × Wr̃ with a subgroup of Wn as in
[L2, p.82]. The virtual representation [λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa ] ⊠ [µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µb ] of Sr × Sr̃
may be regarded as a virtual representation of Wr × Wr̃ via the obvious projection
Wr × Wr̃ −   → Sr × Sr̃ (see [L2, p.82]). We tensor this with the one dimensional
character of Wr × Wr̃ which is the identity on the Wr -factor and is the restriction
of χ : Wn −    → {±1} (see [L2, p.82]) on the Wr̃ -factor. Inducing the resulting
virtual representation from Wr × Wr̃ to Wn , we obtain the virtual representation
(b) of Wn . Note that if λ1 < λ2 < · · · < λa and µ1 < µ2 < · · · < µb then this
is an irreducible representation; if σ is a permutation of 1, 2, . . . , a and σ ′ is a
permutation of 1, 2, . . . , b then
                 h                               i               h              i

From the definition we see easily that
                     h              i h                         i

Lemma 2.4. Let λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λa and µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µb be two sequences of integers
such that 2.3(a) holds. Let w = (2k) × w′ ∈ Wk × Wn−k ⊂ Wn where 0 < k ≤ n,
(2k) denotes an element of Wk whose image under the obvious imbedding Wk ⊂ S2k
is a 2k-cycle and w′ ∈ Wn−k has no cycles of length 2k as an element of S2n−2k .
We have
                    h                   i   a        h                                         i

                                         )=   tr(w′ , µ11       µ2 ... µb
                                                                                                )

                 i=1

    This follows from Lemma 2.2, using the definitions.
2.5. Let m ∈ N and let n = m2 + m. Let wm ∈ Wn be an element whose image
under the imbedding Wn ⊂ S2n = S2(m2 +m) is a product of cycles

Lemma 2.6. In the setup of 2.5, if (∗) holds, then

                 tr(wm , µ1 µ2 ... µm ) = (−1)(m +m)/2 .
                                     h                    i
                                         λ1 λ2 ... λm+1
If (∗) does not hold, then tr(wm ,       µ1 µ2 ... µm
                                                           ) = 0.

   We argue by induction on m. The result is clear when m = 0. Assume now
that m > 0. We can assume that wm = (4m)wm−1 ∈ W2m × Wn−2m ⊂ Wn
where wm−1 ∈ Wn−2m is defined in a way similar to wm . We apply 2.4 with
w = wm , k = 2m, w′ = wm−1 . Note that in the formula in 2.4, at most one term
is non-zero, namely the one in which k = 2m is substracted from the largest entry
λi or µi (the other terms are zero since they contain some < 0 entry). We are in
one of the four cases below.
   Case 1. 2m = λm+1 , 0 = µ1 .
   Using 2.4, we have

Now the induction hypothesis is applicable to

(a)    λ1 − 1 < λ2 − 1 < · · · < λm − 1 and µ2 − 1 < µ3 − 1 < · · · < µm − 1

instead of 2.5(a). (Clearly, 2.5(a) satisfies (∗) if and only if (a) satisfies the analo-
gous condition). Hence, if 2.5(a) satisfies (∗), then
                                             2                      2

as required. If 2.5(a) does not satisfy (∗), then A = (−1)m 0 = 0, as required.
   Case 2. 2m = λm+1 , 0 = λ1 .
   Using 2.4, we have

and this is 0 since 0 appears twice in the top row.
  Case 3. 2m = µm , 0 = λ1 .
  Using 2.4, we have

Now the induction hypothesis is applicable to

(b)    λ2 − 1 < · · · < λm − 1 < λm+1 − 1 and µ1 − 1 < µ2 − 1 < · · · < µm−1 − 1

instead of 2.5(a). (Clearly, 2.5(a) satisfies (∗) if and only if (b) satisfies the anal-

Lemma 2.7. In the setup of 2.6, if (∗) holds, then
  ♯(k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}; µk = even ) = (m2 + m)/2 mod 2.
    Since (*) holds, the left hand side is equal to the number of pairs

Now the induction hypothesis is applicable to

(b)    λ2 − 1 < λ3 − 1 < · · · < λm − 1 and µ1 − 1 < µ2 − 1 < · · · < µm−1 − 1

instead of 2.8(a). (Clearly, 2.8(a) satisfies (∗∗) if and only if (b) satisfies the
analogous condition.) Let N ′ be defined as N in 2.8(b), in terms of (b). Then
N ′ = N − 1. If 2.8(a) satisfies (∗∗), then

                                                        ′
            A = (−1)m (−1)(m−2)(m−1)/2 (−1)N = (−1)m(m−1)/2 (−1)N

as required. If 2.8(a) does not satisfy (∗∗), then A = (−1)m 0 = 0, as required.
   Case 4. 2m − 1 = µm , 0 = µ1 .
   Using 2.4, we have

                                                                                )

and this is 0 since 0 appears twice in the bottom row. The lemma is proved.

Lemma 2.10. Assume that we are in the setup of 2.9, that (∗∗) holds and that
m = 2m′ for some integer m′ > 0. Then
  (a) ♯(k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}; µk ≥ m) − ♯(k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}; µk even ) = m′ mod 2,
  (b) ♯(k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}; µk even ) = N + m(m − 1)/2 mod 2.

    Among the m′ pairs (0, 4m′ − 1), (2, 4m′ − 3), . . . , (2m′ − 2, 2m′ + 1) there are,
say, α pairs with the first component of form λi and second component of form µj
and β pairs with the first component of form µj and second component of form
λi . Clearly, α + β = m′ . Among the m′ pairs

                    (1, 4m′ − 2), (3, 4m′ − 4), . . . , (2m′ − 1, 2m′ )

there are, say, γ pairs with the first component of form λi and second component
of form µj and δ pairs with the first component of form µj and second component
of form λi . Clearly, γ + δ = m′ . From the definitions we have

                     ♯(k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2m′ }; µk ≥ 2m′ ) = α + γ,

                      ♯(k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2m′ }; µk even ) = β + γ.

Hence the left hand side of (a) is equal to α + γ − (β + γ) = α − β, which has
the same parity as α + β = m′ . This proves (a). Now (b) follows from (a) since
m′ = 2m′ (2m′ − 1)/2 mod 2. The lemma is proved.

Proposition 2.11. Assume that G in 0.1 is of type Bn or Cn where n = m2 +
m, m ∈ N, m ≥ 1. We identify the Weyl group W of G with Wn (see 2.3) in
the standard way. Let w = wm , see 2.5. Let ρ be the unique unipotent cuspidal
representation of GF . Then ρ appears with multiplicity 1 in Rw .
                                                                       h                i

   For any subset J of cardinal m of I = {0, 1, 2, . . . , 2m} let EJ = µ1 µ2 ... µm
(an irreducible representation of W ) where µ1 < µ2 < · · · < µm are the elements
of J in increasing order and λ1 < λ2 < · · · < λm+1 are the elements of I − J in
increasing order; let f (J) = ♯(j ∈ J|j even). By [L2, 4.23], the multiplicity of ρ in
Rw is
                                  X
(a)                          2−m     (−1)f (J) tr(wm , EJ )
                                      J
where J runs over all subsets of I of cardinal m. Using 2.6 and 2.7 we see that (a)
equals 2−m ♯(J; J ∩ (2m − J) = ∅) = 1. The proposition is proved.
Proposition 2.12. Assume that G in 0.1 is of type Dn where n = m2 , m =
2m′ , m′ ∈ N, m′ ≥ 1. We identify the Weyl group W of G with the subgroup of
Wn consisting of all permutations w ∈ Wn such that
                     ♯(k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}; w(k) ∈ {1′ , 2′ , . . . , n′ })

is even. (A subgroup of index 2.) Let w = wm     , see 2.8. (We have wm  ∈ W .)

Let ρ be the unique unipotent cuspidal representation of G . Then ρ appears with
multiplicity 1 in Rw .
     For any subset
               h      J of cardinal
                                i   m of I = {0, 1, 2, . . . , 2m − 1} let EJ be the
                 λ1 λ2 ... λm+1
restriction of µ1 µ2 ... µm from Wn to W (an irreducible representation of W )
where µ1 < µ2 < · · · < µm are the elements of J in increasing order and λ1 < λ2 <
· · · < λm are the elements of I − J in increasing order; let f (J) = ♯(j ∈ J|j even).
Note that EJ = EI−J and f (J) = f (I − J). By [L2, 4.23], the multiplicity of ρ in
Rw is
                                   X
(a)                            2−m   (−1)f (J) tr(wm , EJ )
                                      J
where J runs over all subsets of I of cardinal m. Using 2.9 and 2.10 we see that
(a) equals 2−m ♯(J; J ∩ (2m − J) = ∅) = 1. The proposition is proved.
   We return to the general case.
Theorem 2.13. Let ρ be a unipotent cuspidal representation of GF . There exists
w ∈ W such that ρ appears with multiplicity 1 in Rw .
   In view of 2.11, 2.12, we may assume that G is of exceptional type. If ρ ∈ U is
cuspidal, we have ρF,y,σ where F is independent of ρ; we will write ρy,σ instead
of ρF,y,σ ; for the pairs (y, σ) we will use the notation of [L2, 4.3]. For w ∈ W we
denote by |w| the characteristic polynomial of w in the reflection representation
of W . (A product of cyclotomic polynomials Φd .) In the cases that appear below,
|w| determines uniquely w up to conjugacy.

     Type G2 .
     |w| = Φ6 : ρg3 ,θ±1 , ρg2 ,ǫ .
     |w| = Φ3 : ρ1,λ2 .
   In each case, one can compute the multiplicity of ρy,σ in Rw for w in the same
row, using [L2, 4.23]; for the computation we need the character table of W and
the explicit entries of the non-abelian Fourier transform [L2, p.110-113]. The result
in each case is 1. This completes the proof.
Theorem 2.14. (a) Assume that ρ ∈ ŨQ is cuspidal. Then ρ ∈ UQ .
   (b) If G is of type B, C or D and ρ is a unipotent cuspidal representation then
ρ ∈ UQ .
    We prove (a). Let w ∈ W be such that ρ appears with multiplicity 1 in Rw
(see 2.13). Since Rw is the character of a virtual representation defined over Ql ,
it follows that ρ is defined over Ql . (Here l is any prime 6= p.) Using the Hasse
principle it is then enough to show that ρ is defined over R. The following argument
is inspired by an argument of Ohmori [Oh]. Let x be an element of minimal length
in W such that ρ appears    Pwith odd   multiplicity in Rx . (Such x exists by 2.13.)
                                    j j
The multiplicity of ρ in j (−1) H (X̄x , Ql ) is equal to the multiplicity of ρ in
          j j
P
   j (−1)  Hc (Xx , Ql ) plus an integer linear combination of the multiplicities of
ρ in j (−1)j Hcj (Xx′ , Ql ) for various x′ of strictly smaller length than x (these
      P

multiplicities   are even, by the choice of x). It follows that the multiplicity of
ρ in j (−1)j Hj (X̄x , Ql ) is odd. Recall that X̄x has pure dimension l(x). By
      P

Poincaré duality, the GF -modules Hj (X̄x , Ql ), H2l(x)−j (X̄x , Ql ) are dual to each
other. Hence they contain ρ with the same multiplicity (recall that ρ is self-dual.)
         RATIONALITY PROPERTIES OF UNIPOTENT REPRESENTATIONS                           13

It follows that the multiplicity of ρ in Hl(x) (X̄x , Ql ) is odd. Now Hl(x) (X̄x , Ql )
admits a (−1)l(x) -symmetric, non-degenerate, GF -invariant Ql -bilinear form with
values in Ql . (Actually, l(x) is even, by 1.4.) Since ρ is self-dual and has odd
multiplicity in Hl(x) (X̄x , Ql ), an argument in [Oh] shows that ρ itself (regarded as
a Ql [GF ]-module) admits a symmetric, non-degenerate, GF -invariant Ql -bilinear
form with values in Ql . It follows that ρ is defined over R. This proves (a).
   In the setup of (b), ρ is unique up to isomorphism hence it is automatically in
ŨQ . Thus, (a) is applicable and ρ ∈ UQ . The theorem is proved.
2.15. In this subsection we assume that G is non-split. The analogue of 2.13
continues to hold for G. But the analogue of 2.14(a) fails if G is non-split of type
A.
2.16. A statement like 2.13 was made without proof in [L2, p.356] (for not neces-
sarily split G). In that statement, the assumption that ρ is cuspidal was missing.
That assumption is in fact necessary, as 2.17(ii) below (for G of type C4 ) shows.
Lemma 2.17. (i) Let ǫ : W2 × W2 −
                                → {±1} be a character. Then

(a)                            tr(w, indW
                                        W2 ×W2 (ǫ)) ∈ 2Z
                                          4




for all w ∈ W4 .h i
   (ii) Let E = 12 2 (an ireducible representation of W4 ). Then RE is of the form
χρ for some ρ ∈ U. The multiplicity of ρ in Rw is even for any w ∈ W = W4 .
   The residue class mod 2 of the left hand side of (a) is clearly independent of the
choice of ǫ. Hence to prove (a) we may assume that ǫ = 1. Let π : W4 −       → S4 be the
canonical homomorphism. We have tr(w, indW2 ×W2 (1)) = tr(π(w), indSS42 ×S2 (1)).
                                                     W4

But if y ∈ S4 , then tr(y, indSS42 ×S2 (1)) is 6 if y = 1, is 2 if y has order 2 and is 0,
otherwise; in particular, it is even for any y. This proves (i).
   In (ii), the multiplicity of ρ in Rw is tr(w, E) that is, the left hand side of (a)
for a suitable ǫ. Hence it is even by (i). The lemma is proved.

                               3. An example in SO5
3.1. In this section we assume that p 6= 2 and that G = SO(V ) where V is a
5-dimensional k-vector space with a fixed Fq -rational structure and a fixed non-
degenerate symmetric bilinear form (, ) defined over Fq . Let C be the set of all
g ∈ G such that g = su = us where −s ∈ O(V ) is a reflection and u ∈ SO(V ) has
Jordan blocks of sizes 2, 2, 1. Then C is a conjugacy class in G and F (C) = C. A
line L in V (Fq ) is said to be of type 1 if (x, x) ∈ Fq2 − 0 for any x ∈ L − {0} and
of type −1 if (x, x) ∈ Fq − Fq2 for any x ∈ L − {0}. Let L1 (resp. L−1 ) be the set
of lines of type 1 (resp. −1) in V (Fq ). For ǫ, δ ∈ {1, −1}, let C ǫ,δ be the set of all
g ∈ C F such that the line L in V (Fq ) such that g|L = 1 is in Lǫ and any line L in
V (Fq ) such that g|L = −1 and (L, L) 6= 0 is in Lδ . Then C ǫ,δ is a conjugacy class

of GF and C F is union of the four conjugacy classes C 1,1 , C 1,−1 , C −1,1 , C −1,−1 .
We define a class function φ : GF −  → Z by φ(g) = 2δq if g ∈ C ǫ,δ and φ(g) = 0 if
           F
g ∈ G − C . (This is the characteristic function of a cuspidal character sheaf on
G.)
   Let O+ (resp. O− ) be the stabilizer in G of a 4-dimensional subspace of V
defined over Fq on which (, ) is non-degenerate and split (resp. non-split). Let det :
O+ − → {±1} (resp. det : O− −    → {±1}) be the unique nontrivial homomorphism
                                                  F      F
of algebraic groups. The restriction of det to O+   or O−   is denoted again by det.
Consider the virtual representation
                          F             F               F            F
                Φ = indG            G              G            G
                       O F (1) − indO F (det) − indO F (1) + indO F (det)
                          +             +              −             −


of GF . For g ∈ GF we have
             tr(g, Φ) = 2♯(L ∈ L1 ; g|L = −1} − 2♯(L ∈ L−1 ; g|L = −1}
. It follows easily that tr(g, Φ) = φ(g).
   Let θ be the unique unipotent cuspidal representation of GF . Then θ appears
with multiplicity 1 in φ. It follows that θ appears with multiplicity 1 in Φ. Since
the character of θ is Q-valued and Φ is a difference of two representations defined
over Q, it follows that θ is defined over Q. Thus we have proved the rationality
of θ without using the Hasse principle.
3.2. Assume now that q = 3. Then SO(V ) is isomorphic to a Weyl group W of
                 F                                                    F
type E6 while O+   is isomorphic to a Weyl group of type F4 and O−      is isomorphic
to a Weyl group of type A5 × A1 (imbedded in the standard way in the W ). Now
θ corresponds to the 6-dimensional reflection representation of W (Kneser). Its
restriction to the Weyl group of type F4 contains no one dimensional invariant
subspace while its restriction to the Weyl group of type A5 × A1 splits into a
5-dimensional irreducible representation and a non-trivial 1 dimensional represen-
tation. Since θ has multiplicity 1 in Φ (see 3.1) it follows that θ has multiplicity 1
        F
in indGOF
          (det).
