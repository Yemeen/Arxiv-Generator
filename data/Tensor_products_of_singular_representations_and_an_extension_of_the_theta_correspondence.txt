                                                                                     Abstract

                                                         In this paper we consider the problem of decomposing tensor products
                                                     of certain singular unitary representations of a semisimple Lie group G.
                                                     Using explicit models for these representations (constructed earlier by
                                                     one of us) we show that the decomposition is controlled by a reductive
                                                     homogeneous space G′ /H ′ . Our procedure establishes a correspondence
                                                     between certain unitary representations of G and those of G′ . This extends
                                                     the usual θ–correspondence for dual reductive pairs. As a special case we
                                                     obtain a correspondence between certain representations of real forms of
                                                     E7 and F4 .




                                            0        Introduction
                                            Let F be a field and ε some fixed additive character of F . If W is a finite
                                            dimensional vector space over F endowed with a non-degenerate skew-symmetric
                                            form, we can consider an associated Heisenberg group H(W ). Denote by ρε
                                            an irreducible unitary representation of H(W ) on which the center of H(W )
                                            operates via the character ε (it is unique by the theorem of Stone and von
                                            Neumann). Since the symplectic group Sp(W ) operates on H(W ) via its action
                                            on the vector space W , it also acts on the representation ρε . The action is trivial
                                            on the center of H(W ) and therefore, for any g ∈ Sp(W ), there is an operator
                                            ωε (g) (unique up to scaling) which intertwines ρε with ρgε . These operators form
                                            the oscillator representation of Sp(W ). In general, the oscillator representation
                                            ωε is projective, but it always corresponds to an ordinary representation of a

two-fold cover of Sp(W ). This cover is denoted by Sp(W   ^) and is called the
metaplectic group.
    The oscillator representation originated in the works of Segal and Shale and
was immortalized by Weil, who used it in his construction of the theta-functions
on the metaplectic group [W]. In one of the earliest works on the spectrum of
the Weil (oscillator) representation, Gelbart [G1] studied the decomposition
of the tensor product ω ′ = ω ⊗k , where ω is the oscillator representation of
the real symplectic group Sp(2m, R) and k ≥ 2m. He demonstrated that for
k = 2m all representations of the holomorphic discrete series for Sp(2m, R)
occur in the spectrum of ω ′ . Kashiwara and Vergne [KV] extended the results
of [G1] to tensor products ω ⊗k , k ≥ 1. In particular, any unitary highest weight
representation of Sp(2m, R) will appear in the decomposition of ω ⊗k for some
appropriate value of k.
    Later, the approach of [G1] and [KV] was replaced by the modern approach
to the θ-correspondence. One starts with a reductive dual pair of algebraic
groups G and G′ , defined over some local field F , which are mutual centralizers
inside a symplectic group Sp. Let ω be an oscillator representation of the
metaplectic group Spf on a Hilbert space H, and let E ⊂ Sp f denote the preimage
of a reductive subgroup E ⊂ Sp. Denote by R(E) the set of (equivalence classes)
of continuous irreducible representations of E on a locally convex space, which
can be realized as quotients of H∞ by ω(E)–invariant subspaces.

Conjecture 0.1 (Howe’s duality conjecture) The set R(G·G′ ) is the graph
of a bijection between all of R(G) and all of R(G′ ). Moreover, an element of
R(G · G′ ) occurs as a quotient of ω in a unique way.

    Howe’s conjecture has been proved for F = R or C [Ho2], and also for
all non-Archimedean local fields of odd residue characteristic. The resulting
correspondence between the irreducible representations of G and those of G′ is
called the Howe duality correspondence, or the θ-correspondence. In general,
this correspondence does not preserve unitarity, i.e., a unitary representation of
G can correspond to a non-unitarizable representation of G′ .
    If one member of a dual pair (say G′ ) is much “smaller” than the second
group, unitarity is preserved and the duality correspondence is a particularly
nice one (this is a so called stable range duality [Ho1], [L1]). We denote by
b
G(ε)       c′ (ε) the subsets of the unitary duals of G and G′ consisting of
       and G
those unitary irreducible representations whose restriction to the kernel of the
           f → Sp (i.e., the group Z2 ) is a multiple of the non-trivial character
projection Sp
of Z2 . Then the Howe correspondence gives an injection G c′ (ε) ֒→ G(ε).
                                                                    b     In many
                                  ′     ′
cases the coverings G → G and G → G are trivial, and we obtain an injection
of the unitary dual of G′ into that of G.
   Example. G′ = U (1) and G = U (p, q) form a stable range dual pair inside
Sp(2p+2q, R). The representations of U (p, q) appearing in the θ-correspondence

for this reductive dual pair are the “ladder” representations, which were given
this name because their K-types lie along a line, i.e., their highest weights are
obtained from the highest weight of the lowest K-type by adding multiples of a
single vector.
     The duality conjecture also has a global version [G2, 2.5], when F is a global
field, A is an adele ring of F , and one considers a dual pair inside a symplec-
tic group over A. This version is of considerable representation- and number-
theoretic interest, since the global duality correspondence provides a way to lift
automorphic forms between members of a dual pair [G2], [P]. For example, if
         ^ and G ≃ P GL(2) is realized as an orthogonal group preserving
G′ = SL(2)
a 3-variables quadratic form Q(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = x21 − x2 x3 , the θ-correspondence
produces the Shimura lifting which associates a modular form of weight n − 1
to a modular form of half-integral weight n2 .
     It is a remarkable fact that every classical group and no exceptional group
can be realized as a member of a reductive dual pair. It seems desirable to
determine whether one can extend this theory to other reductive groups in
a reasonable manner. In this paper we attempt to extend the original ([G1],
[KV]) approach to the θ-correspondence. We study the decompositions of tensor
products of certain small unitary representations of a real reductive group G
and construct a parametrization of the spectra of these tensor products.
     Let Ω be a symmetric tube domain of rank n, and G = Aut(Ω). The
Shilov boundary of Ω is of the form G/P where P = LN is the Siegel–Poincaré
parabolic subgroup of G. The nilradical N is abelian and so is isomorphic to its
Lie algebra n, and the Levi subgroup L has finitely many (coadjoint) orbits on
n∗ . These orbits are indexed by their “signatures”, where a signature p consists
                                                            def
of a pair of non-negative integers p = (p+ , p− ) with |p| = p+ + p− ≤ n.
     Every non-open orbit (with |p| < n) has a canonical L-equivariant measure,
and the main result of [S] is the construction of an irreducible representation of
the universal cover of G on the associated L2 -space. Usually these representa-
tions descend to G, and in all cases they can be viewed as linear representations
of a certain double cover of G, denoted by G. In this paper we consider the
problem of decomposing certain tensor products of these representations. More
precisely, let Π = π1 ⊗· · ·⊗πs be the tensor product of representations associated
to orbits Op1 ,. . .,Ops whose signatures pi = (p+    −
                                                 i , pi ) satisfy

                           (p+    −               +    −
                             1 + p1 ) + · · · + (ps + ps ) ≤ n.                           (1)

   Under assumption (1), which is an analogue of the stable range condition for
the θ-correspondence, each of the following spaces contains an open and dense
L-orbit
                O ≡ Op1 + . . . + Ops , O′ ≡ Op1 × . . . × Ops .
Fix a generic point ξ ′ = (ξ1 , . . . , ξk ) in O′ such that ξ = ξ1 + . . . + ξk is generic in
O. We denote the inverse images of L and P in G by L and P , respectively. Let

of N defined by χξ (exp x) = exp(i hξ, xi) for x ∈ n.

Theorem 0.2 The restriction of Π to P is isomorphic to ν ⊗ IndP

where ν is a certain unitary character of P .

    In general, S, S ′ are not reductive, however they contain reductive groups
G and H ′ and a common normal subgroup N such that S = G′ ⋉ Z and
    ′

S ′ = H ′ ⋉ Z. We consider the direct integral decomposition

        For each π occurring in L2 (G′ /H ′ ), we define Θ(π) ∈ P

                           Θ(π) = ν ⊗ IndP
                                         G′ ZN (π ⊗ 1 ⊗ χξ ).

By Mackey theory, Θ(π) is irreducible, and Theorem 0.2 implies

Theorem 0.3 The restriction of Π to P has the decomposition

                            Π|P =               m(π)Θ(π) dµ(π) .                   (2)

        The main result of the paper is the following

Theorem 0.4 For almost every π (with respect to the Plancherel measure dµ),
Θ(π) extends to an
                 Psirreducible representation of G, so that (2) is also a G-
decomposition. If i=1 |pi | < n, this extension is unique.

    Thus the map π → Θ(π) gives a (measurable) bijection between unitary rep-
resentations of G occurring in Π and the unitary representations of G′ occurring
in L2 (G′ /H ′ ).
    We now discuss some special cases of the above result:
    If s = 2, then G′ /H ′ is a symmetric space, which is Riemannian if and only
if Op1 and Op2 both have definite signatures (of the form (p+ , 0) or (0, p− )).
Positive (resp. negative) definite orbits correspond to the highest (resp. lowest)
weight singular representations of G, and in this case our constructions comple-
ment the results on the tensor products of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
discrete series representations in [R].
    For Riemannian symmetric spaces, and also for several non-Riemannian
ones, we have m(π) ≤ 1. Thus in these cases we deduce that π1 ⊗ π2 is multi-
plicity free.

   If Ω is the Siegel upper half plane then G = Sp(2n, R), G is the metaplecticP +
group and
      P    G′ /H ′ = O(p+ , p− )/[O(p+     −             + −              +
                                      1 , p1 )×. . .×O(ps , ps )], where p =      pi ,
p− =      p−
           i . In this case our  correspondence     coincides with  the H ′
                                                                            -spherical
part of the θ-correspondence.
   Finally, if Ω is the exceptional tube domain, then G = G is the simply
connected exceptional group E7(−25) . If we take s = 2 and p1 = (1, 0), then
among the possibilities for G′ /H ′ are the various forms of the Cayley projective
plane [A, p.118], i.e., for p2 = (2, 0), p2 = (0, 2) and p2 = (1, 1), we obtain
respectively
           F4(−52) /Spin(9), F4(−20) /Spin(9) and F4(−20) /Spin(1, 8).
Note that these symmetric spaces are multiplicity-free (see [V] for the non-
Riemannian space F4(−20) /Spin(1, 8)) and by Theorem 0.4, so is Π = π1 ⊗ π2 .
   If we take p1 = p2 = (1, 0), then Π is a tensor square of a highest weight
representation π1 , and a description of the spectrum of this tensor square is a
key step in the classification of unitarizable highest weight modules in [EHW].
   Just as with the θ-correspondence, we expect that our results will have
smooth and global analogues. We shall take up some of these questions in
subsequent papers.


1     Notation and Preliminaries
1.1    Groups and subgroups
Let G be one of the following groups:
    • Sp(2n, R) (case I1),
    • U (n, n) (case I2),
    • O∗ (4n) (case I3),
    • O(2, j) (case I4),
    • E7(−25) (case I5),
    and K be the maximal compact subgroup of G. Then Ω = G/K is a sym-
metric domain of tube type [He, p.474]. Taking G = U (n, n) or O(2, j) instead
of SU (n, n) or SO(2, j) is not really necessary, but will make some arguments
more straightforward.
    The restricted root system for each of the groups listed above is of type Cn ,
where n is the real rank of the group G. Let ∆ = {β1 , β2 , . . . , βn } be the basis
of the restricted root system, enumerated in such a way that the corresponding
Dynkin diagram is
                 β1         β2    β3         βn−2      βn−1     βn
                  ◦ —— ◦ —— ◦          ···    ◦ —— ◦ ⇐= ◦            .
6                                        Alexander Dvorsky and Siddhartha Sahi


There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of maximal parabolic
subgroups of G and the set of maximal subsets of ∆. We will be interested in
two parabolic subgroups of G – the Siegel parabolic of G (this corresponds to
the set ∆ \ {βn }) and the maximal parabolic subgroup corresponding to the set
∆ \ {β1 }. We denote the first by P and the second by P ′ .
    The Levi decomposition of P is P = L · N , where the subgroup N is abelian
(e.g., for G = O(2, j) we have n = 2, L = R∗ × O(1, j − 1) and N = R1,j−1 ).
    The Langlands decomposition of P ′ is P ′ = M ′ AN ′ , where the radical N ′
is a two-step nilpotent group with a one-dimensional center ZN ′ , and we can
identify it with the real Heisenberg group of dimension 2m + 1. The vector
subgroup A is one-dimensional, i.e., A = R∗ . For example, G = E7(−25) gives
M ′ A = SO(2, 10) × R∗ and N ′ is the Heisenberg group associated with a 32-
dimensional real vector space.
    The group M ′ splits into a direct product of a compact factor and a non-
compact group, which we denote by G− . The group G− belongs to one of the
families (I1)-(I4), and we can consider its Siegel parabolic P− , the nilradical N−
of P− , etc. In general, all subgroups of G− will be written with a minus as a
subscript.
    The information about some of the subgroups we defined above is summa-
rized in the following table.

1.2      Orbits and representations
The orbits of the natural action of L on n∗ = N ∗ are parametrized by pairs of
non-negative integers p+ , p− with p+ + p− ≤ n [S, 2.1]. The simplest example
of this parametrization can be observed for G = Sp(2n, R), when the group N
can be identified with the vector space of n × n real symmetric matrices, and
an arbitrary orbit O of L = GL(n, R) on N ∗ ≃ N is defined by the signature of
the symmetric matrix ξ ∈ O. We write p for the pair (p+ , p− ), and Op for the
corresponding orbit. The rank of the orbit is p+ + p− , which we denote by |p|.
If |p| = n, the orbit Op is open in N ∗ , otherwise we get small (singular) orbits.
By Sp we denote the stabilizer of ξp ∈ Op in L.
    Suppose now |p| < n. Then Op = L/Sp has an L–equivariant measure dµp
which transforms by some positive character δp of L. The main result of [S]
associates with each nonzero singular orbit Op a unitary irreducible representa-
tion πp of G. Here G = G unless G = Sp(2n, R) or O(2, j) with j odd and G

is a two-fold cover of G in these two cases (for G = Sp(2n, R) we can take G to
be a real metaplectic group).
    If H is a subgroup of G, we write H for the inverse image of H in G.
    The representation πp acts on the Hilbert space L2 (Op , dµp ), and actions of
the elements of the maximal parabolic subgroup P can be written in a particu-
larly simple manner – the action of the reductive part L comes from the action
of L on Op and the unipotent radical N acts by characters

                        [πp (l)h](ξp ) = νp (l)δp (l)−1/2 h(l−1 ξp ), l ∈ L, ξp ∈ Op .

Here χξp is the unitary character of the vector space N defined by ξp ∈ N ∗ and
νp is a unitary character of L (trivial on the identity component of L)1 .

We pick s singular orbits Op1 , . . . , Ops such that |p1 |+. . .+|ps | ≤ n and consider
the tensor product of associated representations

The group L acts on the set O′ = Op1 × . . . × Ops , and up to a set of measure
zero, O′ is a single L–orbit. Note that the set
                  def                                             Ps
               O = Op1 + . . . + Ops = {ζ ∈ N ∗ | ζ =                ζpi ∈ Opi }
                                                                    i=1 ζpi ,
                                                                     Ns
also contains a dense L–orbit. The representation Π acts in i=1 L2 (Opi , dµpi ),
and we can identify this space with L2 (O′ , dµ′ ) where dµ′ is the product measure.
If we fix a generic representative ξ ′ = (ξp1 , . . . , ξps ) ∈ O′ and set

                                      ξ = ξp1 + . . . + ξps ∈ O
        Q                Q
and δ = si=1 δpi , ν = si=1 νpi , we have the following formulas for the actions
of Π|P on L2 (O′ , dµ′ )

                            Π(l0 )f (lξ ′ ) = ν(l0 )δ(l0 )−1/2 h(l0−1 lξ ′ ), l0 ∈ L     (4)

                            Π(n0 )f (lξ ) = χlξ (n0 )h(lξ ), n0 ∈ N .

Let now S ′ and S be the isotropy subgroups of ξ ′ and ξ, respectively, with
respect to the action of L on O′ and O. If |p1 | + . . . + |ps | = n, the groups S ′
and S are reductive.
    1 In   [S] the characters νp and δp are denoted by µ and ν respectively.

It is easy to see that S = U (k, n − k) and S ′ = U (k) × U (n − k). The quotient

Lemma 2.1 Π|P ≃ ν ⊗ IndP                         2
                               S ′ N (1 ⊗ χξ ) (L -induction). Here ν is a character
of L extended trivially to P .

Proof. We denote the induced representation ν ⊗ IndP                        ′
                                                        S ′ N (1 ⊗ χξ ) by Π . Then
                                                  ′
by the definition of the induced representation, Π acts on the space C of square-
summable functions satisfying a standard invariance condition

    C = {f : LN → C | f (ps′ n) = χξ (n)f (p) for p ∈ P , s′ ∈ S ′ , n ∈ N }.    (5)

Let |p1 | + . . . + |ps | < n (strict inequality). Then the quasi-invariant measure
                                   ′          ′
Qs the quotient space LN/S N ≃ L/S is transformed by the character δ =
on
  i=1 δpi of L, and we get


                     Π′ (l0 )f (ln) = ν(l0 )δ(l0 )−1/2 f (l0−1 ln)               (6)
                     Π′ (n0 )f (ln) = f (n−10 ln) = f (l(l
                                                             −1 −1
                                                                n0 ln)) .

We can now define a unitary operator Ψ : L2 (O′ , dµ′ ) → C by setting

                            [Ψh](ln) = χξ (n)−1 h(lξ ′ ).

This operator provides an isometry between L2 (O′ , dµ′ ) and C, and it easy to
check that Ψ intertwines the actions Π and Π′ . Indeed, for the actions of l0 this
is immediate by inspection of formulas (4) and (6), and for the actions of n0 we
get

     Π′ (n0 )[Ψh](ln) = [Ψh](l(l−1 n−1
                                     0 ln) = χξ (l
                                                     −1 −1 −1
                                                       n0 l) χξ (n)−1 h(lξ ′ )
                      = χξ (n)−1 χlξ (n0 )h(lξ ′ ) = [ΨΠ(n0 )h](ln).

Computations for |p1 | + . . . + |ps | = n are almost identical. In this case the
space L/S ′ possesses an L–invariant measure, the action of l0 ∈ L is given by

                              Π′ (l0 )f (ln) = f (l0−1 ln) ,

and we set
                        [Ψh](ln) = χξ (n)−1 δ(l)−1/2 (lξ ′ ).
A straightforward computation shows that this operator intertwines the actions
of Π and Π′ .

   Denote by γ a S ′ –quasi-regular representation of S in L2 (S/S ′ ). That is
                                                             def
          (γ(z)f )(x) = f (z −1 x) for z ∈ S, x ∈ Y = S/S ′ , f ∈ L2 (Y ).        (7)

Of course, γ = IndSS ′ 1, and combining the induction in stages with the fact that
the character χξ of N is SN -fixed, we get

 Π|P ≃ ν ⊗IndP                     P       S                   P
             S ′ N (1⊗χξ ) = ν ⊗IndSN ((IndS ′ 1)⊗χξ ) = ν ⊗IndSN (γ ⊗χξ ). (8)

The groups S and S ′ are, generally speaking, not reductive (except when |p1 | +
. . . + |ps | = n). As was discussed in [S, 2.1], the Lie algebras s and s′ of S and
S ′ , respectively, can be written as

                               s   =        (l1 + g′ ) + u
                              s′   =        (l1 + h′ ) + u ,

where l1 , g′ , h′ are some reductive Lie algebras, h′ ⊂ g′ and u is a nilpotent
radical common for both s and s′ . Let G′ and H ′ be the corresponding Lie
groups.
   In particular, X = G′ /H ′ is a reductive homogeneous space, and we can
consider an H ′ –quasi-regular representation of G′ on L2 (X) (denoted by γ ′ ).
Then the representation γ of S given by the formula (7) can be obtained by
extending γ ′ trivially from G′ to S. Now let
                                    Z ⊕
                               γ′ ≃     m(π)π dµ(π)
                                       b′
                                       G

be a decomposition of a quasi-regular representation γ ′ into a direct integral of
unitary irreducible representations of G′ , where m : Gb ′ → Z+ is a multiplicity
function and dµ a Plancherel measure for a symmetric space X. Each irreducible
representation π ∈ Gb ′ can be extended to an irreducible representation π ∨ of S.
This gives                        Z    ⊕
                             γ≃             m(π)π ∨ dµ(π)
                                   b′
                                   G
and substituting this into (8), we obtain the decomposition of Theorem 0.3
                                 Z ⊕
                          Π|P ≃      m(π)Θ(π) dµ(π),                       (9)
                                   b′
                                   G

where Θ(π) = ν ⊗ IndP        ∨
                        SN (π ⊗ χξ ). Note that representations π present in the
formula (9) (i.e., those with m(π) > 0) are H ′ –spherical representations of G′ .
   Mackey theory guarantees that all representations Θ(π) are unitary irre-
ducible representations of P and Θ(π) ≃ Θ(σ) if and only if π ≃ σ.
   The special case s = 2 deserves some special attention. In this situation
Π = πp ⊗ πq , where p = (p+ , p− ), q = (q + , q − ). We will write G′pq , Hpq
                                                                            ′

3     Extending Θ(π) to G
3.1     The N-spectrum
In this section we study low-rank representations of G. For the classical groups
(cases I1, I2, I3 in our list) a complete theory of low-rank representations can
be found in Li’s paper [L2]. We rely heavily on the ideas and methods of this
paper. Our objective here is to extend the low-rank theory of Li so it can be
applied to representations of the groups O(2, j) and E7(−25) .
    Consider the restriction of the representation Θ(π) = ν ⊗ IndP       ∨
                                                                    SN (π ⊗ χξ ) to
N . This restriction decomposes into a direct integral of unitary characters, and
the decomposition is determined by a projection-valued measure on N       b = N ∗.
                                               ∗
This measure is supported on the set O ⊂ N (an L–orbit of ξ).
    Similarly, for any unitary representation τ of G, we can consider its restric-
tion to the abelian subgroup N and the associated measure µτ on N ∗ . If µτ is
supported on the single orbit Or ⊂ N ∗ , we say that τ is of signature r = (r+ , r− )
and write
                                   signN τ = r.
The number |r| = r+ + r− is the rank of Or . If µτ is supported on one or
several orbits of rank k, we write rankNτ = k.
                                           (1, 0), t > 0
    It will be convenient to set sign t =                .
                                           (0, 1), t < 0
    Remark. For the representations of classical groups, the notion of rank was
introduced in [Ho1] and [L2]. Our definition extends it to G = E7(−25) . For
G = O(2, j) the definition above differs from the notion of rank in [L2] due to
the different choice of the parabolic subgroup P .
Tensor Products of Singular Representations                                     11


   We now take a unitary representation σ of G and consider σ|M ′ N ′ . The
group N ′ is a Heisenberg group defined by an exact sequence

                          1 → ZN ′ → N ′ → R2m → 1,

and the multiplication on N ′ defines a standard skew-symmetric bilinear form
on R2m . The group M ′ acts on N ′ by the automorphisms of N ′ , and it also
acts trivially on the center ZN ′ . Because of this we can view M ′ as a subgroup
of Sp(2m, R).
    Now let ρt be a unique representation of N ′ corresponding in the sense of
Stone - von Neumann theorem to the character χt of ZN ′ ≃ R, where

                         χt (z) = exp(2πitz), z ∈ ZN ′ .

We can extend ρt to the representation of the semidirect product Sp(2m, R)f·N ′
using the corresponding oscillator representation ωt of the metaplectic group
Sp(2m, R) e . This extension restricts to a representation of a semidirect product
M ′ N ′ , and we denote this restriction by ρet .
    By the results of [HM] the subspace of ZN ′ –fixed vectors is invariant under
the action of σ(G), and without loss of generality we may assume that σ has
no ZN ′ –fixed vectors. Then, according to the Mackey theory, σ|M ′ N ′ decom-
poses into representations of the form κt ⊗ ρet , where all κt , t ∈ R∗ are unitary
representations of M ′ . We can write
                                         Z ⊕
                             σ|G− N ′ =       κt ⊗ ρet dt.
                                        R∗

We will now describe the N -spectrum of ρet . It is known that a real vector space
N is endowed with a structure of a simple formally real Jordan algebra with
the unit (denoted by e), and L is the structure group of this Jordan algebra.
Then ZN ′ is a one-dimensional subalgebra of N generated by the primitive
idempotent c.
   This idempotent determines the Peirce decomposition of N [FK, IV.I]:

                       N = N (c, 1) + N (c, 1/2) + N (c, 0).

Observe that N (c, 1) = ZN ′ , N (c, 1/2) = Rm and N (c, 0) = N
                                                              − .          
                                                                1 0       0
   Example. Take G = E7(−25) . Then N = Herm(3, O), c =  0 0             0  and
                                                                0 0       0
the corresponding Peirce decomposition is

                          N = Rc + O2 + Herm(2, O).
                                                               1,9
Hence N (c, 1/2) = O2 = R16 and N (c, 0) = Herm(2, O) = R and this Jordan
algebra is in fact the nilradical N− of the parabolic subgroup P− = [R∗ ×
SO(1, 9)] · R1,9 inside G− = SO(2, 10).

    The action of ρet on N (c, 1) and N (c, 1/2) is easy to describe: these spaces
lie inside N ′ and we can model an irreducible representation ρt of N ′ on the
Hilbert space L2 (N (c, 1/2)). To distinguish between an element x of N (c, 1/2)
and the corresponding vector from Rm , we shall write x   b for the latter. Then

      ρet (n1 c)f (x) = χt (n1 )f (x) = χt (trN [n1 c])f (x), n1 ∈ R                        (10)
      ρet (n1/2 )f (x) = χt (b      b)f (x) =
                             n1/2 · x           χt ( 21 trN [n1/2 x])f (x),   n1/2 ∈ N (c, 1/2).

Here trN is the standard trace functional on the Jordan algebra N .
   Now take z0 ∈ Sym(m, R) ⊂ Sp(2m, R). The action of the oscillator repre-
sentation ωt (z0 ) on L2 (Rm ) is given by the formula

                            ωt (z0 )f (x) = χt ( 12 x   bt )f (x).
                                                    bz0 x

                 bt = trSym(m,R) [(e − c)x2 z0 ].
             bz0 x
Observe that x
  Recall that G− ⊂ Sp(2m, R) and

                          N (c, 0) = N− = P− ∩ Sym(m, R).

For n0 ∈ N (c, 0) and x ∈ N (c, 1/2) we have

                    trSym(m,R) [(e − c)x2 n0 ] = trN− [(e − c)x2 n0 ]

and
                      ρet (n0 )f (x) = χt ( 12 trN [(e − c)x2 n0 ])f (x).                   (11)
  Combining formulas (10) and (11), we can write the formula for ρet (n0 ),
where n0 = n1 c + n1/2 + 2n0 .

               ρet (n0 )f (x) = χt (trN ([c + 12 x + 14 (e − c)x2 ]n0 ))f (x).              (12)

We can identify N ∗ and N by setting φ(n′ )(n′′ ) = trN (n′ n′′ ) for n, n′ ∈ N . It
follows from the formula (12) that the N -spectrum of ρet is supported on the
elements of the form nt (x), x ∈ N (c, 1/2), where

                           nt (x) = t(c + 12 x + 41 (e − c)x2 ).

For an arbitrary element x′ ∈ N (c, 1/2) there exists a special element of the
structure group L, called the Frobenius transformation and denoted by τ (x′ ).
According to Lemma VI.3.1 of [FK], τ (x′ )nt (x) = n′1 + n′1/2 + n′0 , where

                     n′1 = tc
                     n′1/2 = t(2x′ c + 12 x)
                     n′0 = t(2(e − c)x′2 c + (e − c)x′ x + 41 (e − c)x2 ) .

In particular, τ (− x2 )nt (x) = tc.

    We can now describe the N -spectrum of κt ⊗ ρet . If the N− -spectrum of κt
is supported on a set O(κt ), then the support of the N -spectrum of κt ⊗ ρet
consists of the elements nt (x) + n− where x ∈ N (c, 1/2), n− ∈ O(κt ). Then

                           τ (− x2 )(nt (x) + n− ) = tc + n− .

Suppose now that signN σ = r, where r = (r+ , r− ). Then signN (κt ⊗ ρet ) = r,
i.e.,
                           signN (tc + n− ) = r.                           (13)
It is easy to see that (13) implies sign t + signN− n− = r, i.e.,
                                       
                                           (r+ − 1, r− ), t > 0

                                           (r+ , r− − 1), t < 0

We summarize this discussion in the following

                                                                             Z⊕
Lemma 3.1 Let σ be a representation of G, signN σ = r and σ|G− N ′ =              κt ⊗
                                                                             R∗

on a single L− -orbit, and signN− κt = r − sign t.

3.2    Von Neumann algebras
Let τ be a representation of some subgroup H of G. By A(τ, H0 ) we denote the
von Neumann algebra generated by the operators τ (h), h ∈ H0 , where H0 is a
subgroup of H.
   To proceed further we need

Lemma 3.2 Assume that A(κt , G− ) = A(κt , P − ) for all t ∈ R∗ . Then

                   Z⊕                      Z⊕
                 A( κt ⊗ ρet dt , G− ) ⊆ A( κt ⊗ ρet dt , P − N ′ ).
                    R∗                          R∗



Proof. The representation ρt is an irreducible representation of N ′ , therefore
A(ρt , N− ) is the full algebra of bounded operators on L2 (Rm ). Consider the
algebra A(κt ⊗ ρet , G− ). This algebra is generated by operators

                             κt (g− ) ⊗ ρet (g− ), g− ∈ G− .                      (14)

All these operators lie inside A(κt ⊗ ρet , P − N ′ ). Indeed, the algebra A(κt ⊗
ρet , P − N ′ ) contains the set B of all operators of the form κt (p− ) ⊗ a, where a
is an arbitrary bounded operator on L2 (Rm ) and p− ∈ P − . Combining this
14                                          Alexander Dvorsky and Siddhartha Sahi


fact with the assumption A(κt , G− ) = A(κt , P − ), we conclude that the von
Neumann algebra generated by B already contains all operators (14).
    Hence A(κt ⊗ ρet , G− ) ⊆ A(κt ⊗ ρet , P − N ′ ) and

       Z⊕                   Z⊕                     Z⊕
     A( κt ⊗ ρet dt , G− ) ⊆ A(κt ⊗ ρet , G− ) dt ⊆ A(κt ⊗ ρet , P − N ′ ) dt .
        R∗                      R∗                         R∗

But the representations ρet are irreducible and nonisomorphic for different t, and

              Z⊕                               Z⊕
                   A(κt ⊗ ρet , P − N ) dt = A( κt ⊗ ρet dt , P − N ′ ).

              R∗                                R∗


     Observe that P − N ′ is a subgroup of P .
     The next theorem is an analogue of [L2, 4.3].

Theorem 3.3 Let σ be a representation of G , signN σ = r and 0 < |r| < n
(i.e., σ is a low-rank representation of G). Then A(σ, G) = A(σ, P ) .

Proof. The groups G− and P together generate G, and it suffices to check that

                                  A(σ, G− ) ⊆ A(σ, P ).                       (15)

                    Z⊕
But σ|G− N ′ =           κt ⊗ ρet dt, and by Lemma 3.2, the assertion (15) follows
                    R∗
immediately if we can show that A(κt , G− ) = A(κt , P − ) for all t ∈ R∗ . By
Lemma 3.1 all κt are representations of rank |r| − 1 of the group G− , and we
can apply the same line of reasoning to them.
    After |r| steps of this process, we reduce the statement of the theorem to the
case of representations of rank 0 for some group G0 , where G0 is belongs to one
of the families I1-I4. Any representation τ of rank 0 decomposes over characters
of G0 [HM] and it is well known that any character of G0 is determined by its
restriction to the Siegel parabolic P 0 (e.g., [L2, 4.2]). Therefore, A(τ, G0 ) =
A(τ, P 0 ).
                                                                         Ns
    We now return to the problem of decomposing representation Π = i=1 πpi .
The restriction of this representation on P is given by (9), and for any Θ(π) =
ν ⊗ IndP      ∨
        SN (π ⊗ χξ ) in the decomposition (9)

                          signN Θ(π) = signN ξ = i=1 pi .

          Π can be decomposed over the irreducible representations of G of
Therefore P

             Ps
    Assume     i=1 |pi | < n. Then by Theorem 3.3, any two non-isomorphic
irreducible representation from the spectrum of Π restrict to non-isomorphic
irreducible representations of P . Therefore the P -decomposition (9) gives rise
to a G-decomposition

4     Representations of maximal rank
The statement of Theorem 3.3 is certainly false for the representations of max-
imal possible rank, i.e., when signN σ = r and |r|   Ps= n. Nevertheless, a G-

    Remark. If the signature r is semi-definite (i.e. r = (|r| , 0) or (0, |r|)), some
of the signatures in the formula above will involve negative numbers, which is of
course impossible. To simplify notation, we agree that in this case corresponding
summands are simply absent from the decomposition (18).

Lemma 4.1 Let σ = σ1 ⊗ σ2 , where σ1 and σ2 are representations of G =
O(2, j), signN σ1 = r, |r| = 1 and signN σ2 = (1, 0). Then A(σ, G) = A(σ, P ).

Proof. Consider P 1 = P− × O(j − 2) – a parabolic subgroup of M ′ = SL(2) ×
O(j − 2). It suffices to prove that for all v
                                          ′
                                A(λv , M ) = A(λv , P 1 ).
                                                                                  ′
Indeed, this fact combined with formula (18) and Lemma 3.2 gives A(σ, M ) ⊆
A(σ, P ), and the statement of the lemma follows.
     Analysis of (19) shows that λv |M ′ = χv ⊗ ω, where χv decomposes over
characters and ω is an oscillator representation restricted to M ′ . Without loss
of generality we may take ω = ω+ . Two factors of M ′ form a dual reductive   L
pair inside Sp(2(j − 2), R) and the spectrum of ω+ is very well known: ω+ = i
 (i)    (i)         (i)      (i)
η1 ⊗ η2 , where η1 and η2 are irreducible highest weight representations of
                                             (i)       (i)
SL(2) and O(j − 2) respectively, and each η1 and η2 occurs only once in the
                                       (i)                                  (i)
decomposition. Observe that each η1 |P − is irreducible. Therefore A(η1 ⊗
 (i)   ′         (i)      (i)                         ′
η2 , M ) = A(η1 ⊗ η2 , P 1 ), and A(ω, M ) = A(ω, P 1 ). Similarly, A(χv ⊗
     ′
ω, M ) = A(χv ⊗ω, P 1 ). Hence any irreducible component of χv ⊗ω is irreducible
when restricted to P 1 and uniquely determined by this restriction, and A(χv ⊗
     ′
ω, M ) = A(χv ⊗ ω, P 1 ).
    Remark. It is easy to see (by inspection of the above argument) that the
statement of the lemma remains true if we replace σ = σ1 ⊗ σ2 with σ =
Tensor Products of Singular Representations                                     17

  i=1 σ1 ⊗ σ2 , where signN σ1 = r and signN σ2 = (1, 0), 1 ≤ i ≤ k. We
can also replace G = O(2, j) with SO(2, j).

Lemma 4.2 Let σ = σ1 ⊗ σ2 , where σ1 and σ2 are representations of G =
E7(−25) , signN σ1 = r, |r| = 2 and signN σ2 = (1, 0). Then A(σ, G) = A(σ, P ).

Proof. In this case M ′ = G− = SO(2, 10). Once again, it suffices to check that
for all v ∈ R∗
                           A(λv , G− ) = A(λv , P− ).                      (20)
   From (19) we see that λv is either a tensor product of two representations of
rank 1 (in this case the assertion of (20) follows immediately from Lemma 4.1)
or
                                                +
                          λv = (κ−v ⊗ ω− ) ⊕ (κv ⊗ ω+ ),
                                     +
where signN− κ− v = (1, 0), signN− κv = (0, 1). This can occur only when r =
(1, 1), v > 0. But signN− ω− = (0, 1), signN− ω+ = (1, 0) and we find ourselves
in a situation described in the remark to Lemma 4.1.
    Therefore, (20) holds for all v.


Corollary 4.3 Let σ = πp1 ⊗ πp2 ⊗ πp3 be a representation of G = E7(−25) ,
|p1 | = 1, |p2 | = 1, p3 = (1, 0). Then A(σ, G) = A(σ, P ).

Proof. Set σ1 = πp1 ⊗πp2 , σ2 = πp3 . Then signN σ1 = p1 +p2 , signN σ2 = (1, 0)
and the lemma above can be applied.                      Ns         Ps
   We now return to our study of the tensor product Π = i=1 πpi , i=1 |pi | ≤
n.

Theorem 4.4 A(Π, G) = A(Π, P ).
             P
Proof. If si=1 |pi | < n, the statement of this theorem  Ps follows from Theorem
3.3. Hence we can restrict our attention to the case i=1 |pi | = n.
     If G = O(2, j), the only possible case is s = 2, and we may always assume
p2 = (1, 0) and apply Lemma 4.1. Similarly, for G = E7(−25) we can take
ps = (1, 0), and the theorem follows from Lemma 4.2 for s = 2 and Corollary
4.3 for s = 3.
     Finally, in the classical cases (I1-I3) the statement follows immediately from
[L2, 4.7-4.8]. Indeed, for these groups each of the representations πpi appears
in the Howe duality correspondence for an appropriate stable range dual pair
(G′i , G) and all irreducible representations from the spectrum of Π appear in the
duality correspondence for the pair (G′ , G), which is still in the stable range.
Therefore any irreducible representation from the spectrum of Π is irreducible
when restricted to P and uniquely determined by this restriction, and A(Π, G) =
A(Π, P ).

   Therefore the P -decomposition (9) gives rise to a G-decomposition of Π with
respect to the same measure dµ and multiplicity function m(π)
                               Z ⊕
                         Π≃        m(π)θ(π) dµ(π).                         (21)
                                 b′
                                 G

Comparing (9) and (21) we see that θ(π) is a unitary irreducible representa-
tion of G which can be defined (for almost every π with respect to dµ) as a
unique irreducible representation from the spectrum of Π satisfying the condi-
tion θ(π)|P = Θ(π), where Θ(π) = ν ⊗ IndP      ∨
                                          SN (π ⊗ χξ ).
    Theorem 0.4 is thus proved.
