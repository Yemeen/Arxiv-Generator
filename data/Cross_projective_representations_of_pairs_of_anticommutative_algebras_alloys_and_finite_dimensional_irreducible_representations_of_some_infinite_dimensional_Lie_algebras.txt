                                               This article is devoted to some “strange” phenomena in representation theory,
                                            whose existence seems to be unexplainable to me. The discussed subjects are,
                                            perphaps, rather far from the wide roads of classical and modern researches, how-
                                            ever, one might pay an attention to them as for themselves as for any associations,
                                            which they may provoke. Concerning the applications of the collected facts I as
                                            a realist suspect that everything being correctly imagined really exists somewhere
                                            and if any Theory is beyond our Practice one should follow the most practical
                                            advice that is proposed, namely, let try to make the least a bit wider and do not
                                            cut off the first.
                                            1.1. Cross-projective representations of pairs of anticommutative algeb-
                                            ras.
                                            Definition 1. Let Ai (i = 1, 2) be two anticommutative algebras with brackets
                                            h·, ·ii . A cross-projective representation of the pair (A1 , A2 ) in the linear space V
                                            is the pair (T1 , T2 ) of mappings Ti : Ai 7→ End(V ) such that

                                                               [T1 (X), T1 (Y )] − T1 (hX, Y i1 ) ≡ 0 mod T2 (A2 ),
                                                                [T2 (A), T2 (B)] − T2 (hA, Bi2 ) ≡ 0 mod T1 (A1 ),

                                            for all X, Y ∈ A1 , A, B ∈ A2 . Here [·, ·] is the commutator of operators.
                                               The definition 1 is related to one of A-projective representations (see e.g.[1,2]).
                                            Any A-projective representation of an anticommutative algebra g defines a cross-
                                            projective representation of the pair (g, A[·,·] ) (here A[·,·] is the commutator Lie
                                            algebra of the associative algebra A).
                                            Example 1. Let g be a Lie algebra decomposed into the direct sum g1 ⊕ g2 of linear
                                            spaces supplied by the brackets h·, ·ii , which are projections of the commutator [·, ·]
                                            in g onto gi along the complementary subspace. Then any representation T of g
                                            defines the cross-projective representation (T1 , T2 ) (Ti = T |gi ) of the pair (g1 , g2 ).
                                            Remark 1. Definition 1 admits natural higher combinatorial generalizations if one
                                            use a set of arbitrary number of anticommutative algebras instead of their pair.
   One may introduce the basic concepts of representation theory (reducible, irredu-
cible, decomposable, etc. representations) for the cross-projective representations.
Sometimes the problem of classification of irreducible finite-dimensional represen-
tations of a pair of anticommutative algebras is hugely wild, e.g. for a pair of abelian
algebras (Cn , Cm ). However, we shall see below that this problem is slightly timer
for more nontrivial pairs.
Remark 2. Let (T1 , T2 ) be a finite-dimensional representation of the pair (g1 , g2 ) in
                                                  tr Ti (X)
the space V then (T1× , T2× ) (Ti× (X) = Ti (X) −           E, E is the unit matrix) is
                                                   dim V
also a representation of this pair.
                                                         V2
Remark 3. Let g be an anticommutative algebra then          (g) also possesses a natural
structure of anticommutative algebra so that it is possible to associate cross-pro-
                                        V2
jective representations of the pair (g, (g)) with any anticommutative algebra g.
   Note that cross-projective representations do not form neither tensor nor even
abelian category. To improve the situation one should consider it from a different
point of view.
1.2. Alloys and their representations.
Definition 2.                                                U U
   A. Let g be a linear space decomposed into the sum g1 . . . gn of its subspaces
                                                                                  V2
gi (the sum is not direct in general). Let us consider the subspace W of             (g)
                V2      U U V2
of the form        (g1 ) . . .  (gn ). The linear space g supplied by the partial
anticommutative binary operation [·, ·] : W 7→ g is called an alloy.
   B. A representation T of the alloy (g, [·, ·]) in the linear space V is the mapping
T : g 7→ End(V ) such that [T (X), T (Y )] = T ([X, Y ]) for all pairs (X, Y ) from W .
Here [·, ·] is the commutator of operators in the right hand side of the identity.
Remark 4. The definition may be naturally generalized to arbitrary subspaces W
   V2
of    (V ) instead of ones of a specific form considered above.
   Note that each Lie composite (see e.g.[1,3]) may be considered as an alloy.
Theorem 1. Let (T1 , T2 ) be a strict cross-projective representation of the pair of
anticommutative algebras (g1 , g2 ) such that T1 (g1 ) ∩ T2 (g2 ) = 0. Then T = T1 ⊕ T2
realizes a strict representation of a uniquely defined alloy g = g1 ⊕ g2 such that
projections of the binary operation [·, ·] in g on gi along the complementary subspaces
coincide with the binary operations in the anticommutative algebras gi .
Remark 5. If one omits the condition of transversality of images of T1 and T2 or
the condition of strictness of representations then it will be possible to construct
an alloy but the least will not be uniquely defined.
Proposition 1. The representations of a fixed alloy g form a tensor abelian cate-
gory.
1.3. Quaternary algebras and their alloyability.
Proposition 2. Let g = g1 ⊕ g2 be an alloy then gi are supplied by the struc-
ture of both binary and quaternary algebras. The quaternary operation h·, ·, ·, ·ii :
V2 V2
   ( (gi )) 7→ gi is constructed in the following way
                       hU, V, X, Y i1 = λ2 (λ1 (U, V ), λ1 (X, Y )),
                       hA, B, C, Di2 = λ1 (λ2 (A, B), λ2(C, D)),
                                            2
where U, V, X, Y ∈ g1 , A, B, C, D ∈ g2 and λi are projections of the operation [·, ·] in
the alloy g restricted to gi and projected along gi onto the complementary subspace.
Corollary. Any strict cross-projective representation (T1 , T2 ) of the pair of anti-
commutative algebras (g1 , g2 ) such that T1 (g1 ) ∩ T2 (g2 ) = 0 supplies both algebras
by additional quaternary operations.
Remark 6. In general, the quaternary operations are not correlated with binary
operations in any way.
   Corollary is a manifestation of an interesting phenomena that a relation of
two objects (anticommutative algebras here) in their mutual representation (cross-
projective representation here) supplies them by additional abstract algebraic struc-
tures (quaternary operations here).
Remark 7. Note that for any quaternary algebra g the following statements hold:
      V2
    –    (g) is a quaternary algebra;
      V2 V 2
    –    ( (g)) is an extension of g, i.e. there exists a homomorphism π :
      V2 V 2
         ( (g)) 7→ g of quaternary algebras (defined just by the quaternary
      operation h·, ·, ·, ·i in g).
Definition 3. Two quaternary algebras gi (i = 1, 2) with operations h·, ·, ·, ·ii :
V2 V2
  ( (gi )) 7→ gi will be called alloyable iff they possess a mutual factorization
                        hU, V, X, Y i1 = λ2 (λ1 (U, V ), λ1 (X, Y )),
                      hA, B, C, Di2 = λ1 (λ2 (A, B), λ2(C, D)),
                                               V2                      V2
where U, V, X, Y ∈ g1 , A, B, C, D ∈ g2 , λ1 :    (g1 ) 7→ g2 and λ2 :    (g2 ) 7→ g1 .
Remark 8. The problem of an alloyability of two quaternary algebras may be consid-
ered as a certain specific algebraic counterpart of the Kolmogorov-Arnold problem
for functions of several variables [4,5].
Proposition 3. For any quaternary algebra g1 there exists an alloyable quaternary
algebra g2 .
                        V2
Proof. One may consider    (g1 ) as g2 .
   The proposition 3 means that the relation of alloyability RA on the class Q of
quaternary algebras in nondegenerate. Note that the dimension of the space Qn of
quaternary algebras of dimension n is equal to 18 (n + 1)n2 (n − 1)(n − 2) whereas the
dimension of the graph of the relation RA in Qn ⊕ Qm is equal to 12 nm(n + m − 2)
so the condition of alloyability is rather strong. I suspect that the problem of
classification of pairs of alloyable quaternary algebras is wild.
Remark 9. Let g be an anticommutative algebra with the bracket h·, ·i supplied by
the additional structure of a quaternary algebra with the operation h·, ·, ·, ·i then
V2
   (g) is also an anticommutative algebra supplied by such additional structure
                                                       V2
(remarks 3,7). The quaternary operations in g and         (g) are alloyable, their fac-
torizations λ1 , λ2 coupled with the anticommutative binary operations in g and
V2                                                       V2
   (g) define the structure of an alloy in the space g ⊕     (g).
   Note that in any anticommutative algebra g with the binary operation h·, ·i one
may construct an additional quaternary operation h·, ·, ·, ·i as
                           hA, B, C, Di = hhA, Bi , hC, Dii .
                                             3
If the space g possesses two brackets h·, ·ii (i = 1, 2) then one may construct six
                                  k
quaternary operations h·, ·, ·, ·iij (i, j, k = 1, 2) as

                                      k
                   hA, B, C, Diij = h hA, Bii , hC, Dij ik + (i ↔ j).

1.4. Universal envelopping
                       U U         Lie algebras of alloys and their represen-
tations. Let g = g1 . . . gn be an alloy. The Lie algebra g̃ will be called the
envelopping Lie algebra for the alloy g iff there exists a monomorphism of g into g̃
(the least is considered as an alloy) in the category of alloys. The universal object
in the category of envelopping Lie algebras for the alloy g will be denoted by L(g)
and called the universal envelopping Lie algebra of alloy g.
Theorem 2. The representations of alloy g define the representations of the uni-
versal envelopping Lie algebra L(g) and vice versa.
Remark 10. The universal envelopping Lie algebras of alloys are infinite-dimen-
sional as a rule.
   Note that the infinite-dimensional Lie algebras L(g) are essentially wild, however,
the theory of their finite-dimensional representations may be a bit timer (as a
rule time infinite-dimensional Lie algebras have only trivial in some sense finite-
dimensional representations). This statement will be illustrated by examples below.
   Let g be an alloy and L0 (g) be the category of all finite-dimensional envelopping
Lie algebras for g (the elements of L0 (g) are Lie algebras g̃ with the fixed imbedding
ι : g 7→ g̃). Let us denote by F R(h) the category of finite-dimensional represen-
tations of a Lie algebra h. If g̃1 , g̃2 ∈ L0 (g) and πi ∈ F R(g̃i ) (i = 1, 2) then put
π1 ∼ π2 iff π1 |g = π2 |g .
   def

Proposition 4. F R(L(g)) is a tensor category, which may be represented as
                                                   M
                               F R(L(g)) =                 F R(g̃)/ ∼ .
                                               g̃∈L0 (g)


   The proposition 4 means that the representations of different Lie algebras g̃
(supplied by with the fixed imbeddings of g into them) allow mutual tensor pro-
ducts.
1.5. Examples. Let us consider a four-dimensional alloy asl(2, C) generated by
the elements e0 , f± and e1 with brackets [e0 , f± ] = ±f± , [f+ , f− ] = 2e0 +e1 . This is
an alloy related to a cross-projective representation of a pair (sl(2, C), C) in general
position (up to an automorphism of sl(2, C)).
Theorem 3. Any irreducible finite-dimensional e0 -diagonal representation of the
alloy asl(2, C) has the form

                           0    A1        0                       0              0
                                                                                  
                                ..                                      ..
                f+ 7→             .      AN  ,       f− 7→  B1            .       ,
                           0               0                   0       BN        0
                          C0               0
                                            

               e0 7→            ..          ,        e1 7→ [f+ , f− ] − 2e0 ,
                                      .
                          0               CN
                                                   4
where Ci = (γ −i)E (E is the ni ×ni -dimensional unit matrix), Ai , Bi are ni−1 ×ni -
and ni × ni−1 -dimensional matrices, respectively. The condition of irreducibility
puts some relations on the numbers ni (the dimensions of blocks), namely

                           n0 = nN = 1,       ni ≤ ni−1 + ni+1

as well as additional relations on matrices Ai and Bi , namely that the pair of
ni ×ni matrices Ai+1 Bi+1 and Bi Ai algebraically generate the whole matrix algebra
Matni (C) for all i.
Remark 11 (An exercise). It is a nice exercise to classify the irreducible represen-
tations of asl(2, C) of small dimensions and to calculate the decompositions of their
tensor products. My own calculations gave me a lot of pleasure.
Remark 12. It is important that the finite-dimensional irreducible representations
of asl(2, C) have the continuous moduli. I suspect that such situation is typical
for representations of alloys and differs it from the theory of finite-dimensional
representations of finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
