                                                                          Kay Magaard and Gordan Savin

                                                  Abstract. Let G be a split simply laced group defined over a p-adic field F . In this paper
                                                  we study the restriction of the minimal representation of G to various dual pairs in G. For
                                                  example, the restriction of the minimal representation of E7 to the dual pair G2 × Sp(6) gives
                                                  the non-endoscopic Langlands lift of irreducible representations of G2 to Sp(6).




                                                                                       Introduction
                                                Let F be a p-adic field and G be a split simple group of type Dn or En , (n = 6, 7, 8)
                                             over F . If the type is Dn then G is SO(2n). In [KS] the minimal representation V of G
                                             was introduced and in [S] some further properties of it were studied. It is an analogue of
                                             the Weil representation of Sp(2n) and in some ways it is better behaved then the Weil
                                             representation. Therefore it makes sense to ask if one can use it to obtain dual pair
                                             correspondences.
                                                We have two types of dual pairs in G. In SO(2n + 2) we have a dual pair

                                                                                    SO(2n − 1) × SO(3).

                                             If G is exceptional then we have a dual pair

                                                                                         G2 (F ) × HD

                                             with HD of type A2 , C3 or F4 , respectively.
                                                Let A × B be a dual pair in G and X an irreducible representation of A. We say that
                                             an irreducible representation Y of B is a Θ-lift of X if X ⊗ Y is a quotient of V (see [H1]).
                                             Let Θ(X) be the set of all such Y .
                                                In this paper we compute Jacquet functors VU of V where U is a unipotent radical of a
                                             maximal parabolic subgroup of SO(3) or HD , with U commutative, or a unipotent radical
                                             of a maximal parabolic subgroup of G2 such that U is a Heisenberg group. The results
                                             are reminiscent of those of Kudla [Ku] and Rallis [Ra] in the classical case. We then use
                                             the knowledge of Jacquet functors to obtain dual pair correspondences. For example, we

compute Θ-lifts of tempered spherical representations of SO(3), A2 , C3 and G2 . The lifts
from A2 to G2 and from G2 to C3 obtained by restricting the minimal representation of
E6 and E7 respectively, are Langlands correspondences.
    In a sequel to this paper we plan to compute Jacquet functors VU for unipotent radicals
of remaining maximal parabolic subgroups. Once this is done, it will be possible to compute
lifts of most Langlands quotients and check the conjectural answer for the exceptional
correspondences as given by B. Gross [G2]. Local computations are, in a way, a preparation
for global correspondences (i.e. correspondences of automorphic forms). So it is worth
mentioning that in a forthcoming work, D. Ginzburg, S. Rallis and D. Soudry are studying
a global variant of exceptional correspondences. Another possible global application has
recently been initiated by B. Gross in connection to a realization of a G2 -motive [G1].
    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we recall the definition and few properties
of the minimal representation from [S]. In Section 2 we study the dual pair SO(3)×SO(2n−
1). It is the simpliest case and as such it is a good introduction to exceptional dual pairs
which form a more interesting part of this work. In Sections 3 and 4 we study the dual pair
G2 × A2 . We compute Θ-lifts of spherical tempered representations of A2 . In Section 5 we
study the dual pair G2 × C3 . We compute Θ-lifts of spherical tempered representations of
C3 . In Section 6 we recall some facts about simple Jordan algebras or rank 3. Exceptional
groups can be described nicely in terms of Jordan algebras. We use this description in
Section 7 to compute VU where U is the unipotent radical of the ”Heisenberg” maximal
parabolic subgroup of G2 in all three cases. We finish the paper by computing Θ-lifts of
spherical tempered representations of G2 in all three cases.

                              1. Minimal representation
   Let G be a simple, split, group of type A2n−1 , Dn or En . Let L G be the complex
L-group of G (see [B]). It is well known that conjugacy classes of unipotent elements in
L
  G correspond to conjugacy classes of homomorphisms

                                                           L
                                     ϕ : SL2 (C) →             G.

Assume now that ϕ corresponds to the subregular unipotent orbit. Let q be the order of
the residual field of F . Let           1      

Then V is the spherical representation of G with the Satake parameter s (see [Ca]).
   Let g be the Lie algebra of G. Let < ·, · > be the Killing form on g. Fix ψ : F → C× , a
non-trivial character. Let Cc∞ (g) denote the space of locally constant, compactly supported
functions on g. Define the Fourier transform on Cc∞ (g) by

Let Omin be the unique minimal nilpotent G-orbit in g and µOmin a G-invariant measure
on Omin normalized as in [MW]. Let gZ be the Z-span of a Chevaley basis of g. Let R be
the ring of integers of F and ̟ the uniformizing element. Let

                                         gn = gZ ⊗Z ̟ n R.

In [S] we have shown that there exists m > 0 such that
                                  Z                        Z

for any f ∈ Cc∞ (g) supported on gm and such that fˆ(0) = 0.
   This implies ”smallness” of the N -spectrum of V , where N is a unipotent radical of
a maximal parabolic subgroup of G. More precisely, let ∆ be the Dynkin diagram of G.
Mark the diagram ∆ as follows. Attach 0 to the unique branch vertex (or to the middle
vertex of ∆ if the type of G is A2n−1 ) and 2 to all other. This marking corresponds to the
subregular nilpotent orbit [D]. Let P = M N be a maximal parabolic subgroup of G. Let
∆M be the Dynkin diagram of M . Assume that we are in the following favorable situation:
   (1) N is a commutative group.
   (2) The marking of ∆ corresponding to the subregular nilpotent orbit of G restricts to
       the marking of ∆M corresponding to the subregular nilpotent orbit of M .
The possible cases are given by the following table:

                                          G      M     N
                                         Dn+1    Dn   F 2n
                                          E6     D5   F 16
                                          E7     E6   F 27
Here F 2n is the standard representation of SO(2n), F 16 is a spin-representation of Spin10
and F 27 is isomorphic to the exceptional Jordan algebra. We say that a point in N is
singular if it is a highest weight vector for a Borel subgroup of M . Let ω and ω be the sets
of singular vectors in N and N . Note that ω is the smallest non-trivial M -orbit in N . If
G = SO(2n) then ω is the null-cone of the invariant quadratic form (with 0 excluded).

VN is the space of N -coinvariants of V (Jacquet functor).

        where VM is the minimal representation of M (center acting trivially).
In the above formulas < ·, · > is the F -valued pairing between N and N induced by the
Killing form on g, det is determinant of the representation of M on N , d is the dimension
of N and the values of s and t are given in the following table.

Proof. This is just Theorem 6.5 in [S] if G is E7 . The other two cases also satisfy conditions
of Proposition 4.1 in [S]. Hence the proof carries over with no changes. The proof given in
[S], however, is valid only when the residual characterisitic is odd. It remains to discuss
the case when the residual characteristic is 2.
   Let x ∈ N , and define ψx (n) = ψ(< x, n >). Let VN,ψx be the quotient of V by the
space spanned by the elements {π(n)v − ψx (n)v|n ∈ N, v ∈ V }. The key point in the proof
of Theorem 6.5 in [S] is to show that
                                          VN,ψx = 0
for x 6= 0 and not in ω, i.e. the N -spectrum of V is concentrated on the closure of the
smallest M -orbit in N . This follows from the work of Moeglin and Waldspurger [MW],
but only if the residual characteristic of F is odd.
   Let k be a number field and A its ring of adeles. Ginzburg, Rallis and Soudry [GR] have
constructed a square integrable automorphic form Π = ⊗v Πv on GA isomorphic to V at
every finite place. But arguing exactly as Howe ([H2] Lemma 2.4), one shows that if the
N -spectrum is concentrated on the closure of ω at one place v, it has to be concentrated
on the closure of ω at all places. This completes the proof of the theorem.

                           2. Dual pair SO(2n − 1) × SO(3)
   Let G = SO(2n + 2). Let e, h, f be the standard basis for sl(2), the Lie algebra of
SO(3) = P GL2 (F ). Let P = M N be the maximal parabolic of G as in Section 1. Let g
be the Lie algebra of G and let
                                   g=n+m+n
be the corresponding decomposition of g. The embedding SO(3) ⊆ SO(2n+2) corresponds
to sl(2) ⊆ g such that
    (1) n = {x ∈ g | [h, x] = −2x}.
    (2) m = {x ∈ g | [h, x] = 0}.
    (3) n = {x ∈ g | [h, x] = 2x}.

Note that e ∈ n, f ∈ n and SO(2n − 1) is the centralizer of e in M .

Proof. This is just Theorem 1.1.
  Let χ be a multiplicative character of F . Let ρχ denote the character of L defined by

             SO(3)
Let τχ = IndQ     ρχ. If χ is unitary than τχ is an irreducible tempered spherical repre-
sentation of SO(3). Let σ ∈ Θ(τχ ). By Frobenius reciprocity

             HomSO(2n−1)×SO(3) (V, σ ⊗ τχ ) = HomSO(2n−1)×L (VU , σ ⊗ ρχ).

Therefore, σ ∈ Θ(τχ ) is a quotient of V if and only if σ ⊗ ρχ is a quotient of VU . Since

                               0 → Cc∞ (ω)U → VU → VN → 0

we need to understand Cc∞ (ω)U . Let N N and N N be the complements of U and U in N
and N . Let ω, as before, be the set of singular vectors in N . Put

                                       ωω = ω ∩ N N .

Lemma 2.2.

                                    Cc∞ (ω)U = Cc∞ (ωω).
Proof. Let us recall few known facts about Jacquet functors. Let E be a U -module. Then
EU = E/E(U ) where E(U ) can be defined either as the space spanned by the elements
{π(u)v − v|u ∈ U, v ∈ E} or the space of all v such that
                                     Z
                                        π(u)vdu = 0
                                       Uc

for some open compact subgroup Uc ⊂ U depending on v (2.33 [BZ]).

   Obviously, Cc∞ (ωω) is a quotient of Cc∞ (ω) and by Theorem 1.1 (1), U acts trivially on
Cc∞ (ωω). Let f ∈ Cc∞ (ω) such that f |ωω = 0. To prove the lemma, we need to find an
open compact subgroup Uc such that
                                Z
                                    ψ(< x, u >)f (x)du = 0
                                   Uc

for all x ∈ ω. Let x be such that f (x) 6= 0. Since x is not in N N , there exists an open
compact neighborhood O of x and an open compact subgroup UO such that ψ(< y, u >)
is a non-trivial character of UO for any y ∈ O. Since the support of f is compact, a finite
collection of O covers the support of f . The union of the corresponding UO is the desired
Uc . The lemma follows.
    We can, therefore, summarize the situation with the following proposition.
Proposition 2.3. VU has a filtration with two quotients:
                                        Cc∞ (ωω), and VN .
As SO(2n − 1) × L-modules:

          where VM   is the minimal representation of M (center acting trivially).
   Note that N N = F 2n−1 and ωω is the null-cone of the SO(2n − 1)-invariant quadratic
form (with 0 excluded). Let C ∞ (ωω) be the space of locally constant functions on ωω. We
can define degenerate principal series representations σχ by
                                                                  3
                        σχ = {f ∈ C ∞ (ωω) | f (cx) = χ(c)|c| 2 −n f (x)}.
Analogously, σχ can be defined as a quotient of Cc∞ (ωω) consisting of f such that
                                                    3
                                   f (cx) = χ(c)|c| 2 −n f (x).
If χ is unramified and unitary than σχ is an irreducible unitarizable spherical representation
by a result of Tadić [T2], Theorem 9.2. We are now ready to state and prove the main
result of this section.
Proposition 2.4. Let χ be an unramified, unitary multiplicative character. Then
                                         Θ(τχ ) = {σχ }.

Proof. Let σ ∈ Θ(τχ ). Then σ × ρχ is a quotient of VU . Since ρχ is different from | · |n−1
and | · | if χ is unitary, it follows that σ × ρχ is quotient of Cc∞ (ωω). Therefore σ must be
isomorphic to σχ . To finish the theorem, we have to show that σχ ∈ Θ(τχ ). By Frobenius
reciprocity, it suffices to show that σχ × ρχ is a quotient of VU . We know that it is a
quotient of Cc∞ (ωω). We need the following lemma.

Lemma 2.5. Let H be a group and
                                  0 → V1 → V2 → V3 → 0
a sequence of H-modules. Let W be a H-invariant quotient of V1 . Assume that there exists
a H-invariant linear map T on V2 reducing to scalar multiplications by λ and µ on W and
V3 . If λ 6= µ then W is a quotient of V3 .
Proof. Let V0 be such that
                                 0 → V0 → V1 → W → 0.
Then
                                0 → W → V2 /V0 → V3 → 0
Since the eigenvalues of T are different, the last sequence splits and the lemma follows.
  Let ̟ be the uniformizing element of F . Put
                                                     
                                           ̟
                                  T =π                    .
                                                  1
If χ is unitary, T satisfies the conditions of Lemma, hence σχ × ρχ is a quotient of VU and
the theorem is proved.

                                       3. Group E6
    Let J be the 27-dimensional exceptional Jordan algebra and (x, y, z) be the Dickson
trilinear form on J (see [J2]). Let GS be the isometry group of the Dickson form. It is a
split, simply-connected groups of type E6 [A1].
    Let gS be the Lie algebra of GS . Then
                                     gS = n̄ + mS + n
where [mS , mS ] = so(10) and n̄, n are two spin-representations.
   Let PS = MS N be the corresponding maximal parabolic subgroup in GS . Then
[MS , MS ] = Spin10 and Spin10 can be defined as the subgroup of GS stabilizing the
10-dimensional subspace J10 of J consisting of matrices in J such that the coefficients in
the third row and the third column are zero and fixing the vector
                                                    
                                            0 0 0
                                      d = 0 0 0.
                                            0 0 1
In particular, Qd (x, y) = (x, y, d) is the invariant quadratic form on J10 and N (one of the
spin-modules) can be identified with the space in J consisting of matrices
                                                     
                                             0 0 y
                                          0 0 z.
                                             y z 0
The group GS has a unique smallest, non-trivial orbit Ω on J. It is the orbit of d and its
dimension is 17. On the other hand, MS has two non-trivial orbits on N and the smaller
(call it ω) can be identified with Ω ∩ N [A1].

                                    4. Dual pair G2 (F ) × P GL3 (F )
   Let D be a nondegenerate subalgebra of the Octonions and let JD denote the subalgebra
of J obtained by restricting the off-diagonal entries of the matrices of J to D. When
dim(D) = 1, i.e. D =< 1O >= F then JF is the algebra of symmetric 3 × 3 matrices over
F and CGS (JF ) = G2 (F ), the split group of type G2 . The centralizer of G2 (F ) in GS is
SL3 (F ) [A1].
   Let G, GS ⊂ G, be a reductive group of type E6 appearing as a Levi factor of a maximal
parabolic subgroup of a split, simply-connected group of type E7 . Then CG (G2 (F )) =
GL3 (F ). The action of GS on J can be extended to G. Indeed, the inclusion GL3 ⊂ G
induces an isomorphism GL3 /[GL3 , GL3 ] ∼ = G/[G, G]. Since [G, G] = GS , it suffices to
extend the action to GL3 ⊂ SL3 . This is done by the formula

                                                      gxg t

where x ∈ J, g ∈ GL3 (F ) and g t is the transpose of g.
  Let g be the Lie algebra of G. Then, as in Section 3,

                                                g = n̄ + m + n

with mS ⊂ m. Let P = M N be the corresponding maximal parabolic subgroup of G.
Then Q = LU = P ∩ GL3 (F ) is a maximal parabolic subgroup of GL3 with L = GL2 (F ) ×
GL1 (F ). One can write
                                  gl(3) = ū + l + u
where l ⊂ m, u ⊂ n and u ⊂ n.
Proposition 4.1. Let V be the minimal representation of G, the center acting trivially.
Identify N with the set of pairs of Octonions (y, z). Let f ∈ Cc∞ (ω). Then:
   (1)
                     π(g)f ((y, z)) = f ((g −1 y, g −1 z)), g ∈ G2 (F ).
    (2)

                                    | det l2 |2 −1
          π(l2 × l1 )f ((y, z)) =              f (l1 (y, z)l2 ),   l2 × l1 ∈ GL2 (F ) × GL1 (F )
                                       |l1 |4

where det denotes the usual determinant of 2 × 2 matrices.
Proof. This is just Theorem 1.1.
   Let Y be an irreducible representations of GL3 (F ) and Ỹ an irreducible representation
of G2 (F ) such that Ỹ ∈ Θ(Y ). Assume that Y is a submodule of IndGL     Q
                                                                              3
                                                                                X for some
irreducible representation X of L. By Frobenius reciprocity

                      HomG2 ×GL3 (V, Ỹ ⊗ Ind X) = HomG2 ×L (VU , Ỹ ⊗ X).
                          EXCEPTIONAL Θ-CORRESPONDENCES I                                   9

Therefore, Ỹ ⊗ Y is a quotient of V only if Ỹ ⊗ X is a quotient of VU . Since

                               0 → Cc∞ (ω)U → VU → VN → 0

we need to understand Cc∞ (ω)U . Let N N and N N be the orthogonal complements of U
and U in N and N . Since U can be identified with the space in J consisting of matrices
                                                      
                                            0   0    y
                                           0   0    z
                                            y   z    0

where y, z ∈ F , it follows that
                                             
                                 0     0    y
                        N N = { 0     0    z  | y = −y and z = −z}.
                                 y     z    0

Let ωω = ω ∩ N N . As in Lemma 2.2 Cc∞ (ω)U = Cc∞ (ωω), and we have to understand the
structure of G2 (F ) × L orbits on ωω which is, of course, the same as the structure of orbits
on ωω = ω ∩ N N .
Proposition 4.2.
   (1) ωω = {(y, z) 6= (0, 0)|y = −y, z = −z and y 2 = z 2 = yz = 0}.
   (2) Let AA and BB be the subsets of ωω consisting all pairs (y, z) such that the space
       F y + F z has dimension 2 and 1 respectively. Then AA and BB are G2 (F ) ×
       GL2 (F )-orbits.

Proof. Let us prove the corresponding statement for ωω. Let
                                                      
                                       0         0   y
                                   n= 0         0   z  ∈ ωω.
                                      −y        −z   0

Since n is a traceless matrix in J it will be singular iff n2 = 0. But this is equivalent to
y 2 = z 2 = yz = 0. The first part of the proposition is proved.
    We go on to observe that G2 has three orbits on the set of spaces of traceless Octonions
with the property that the Octonion multiplication is trivial. These are characterized by
their dimension; the possible choices being 0, 1, 2. The stabilizers of the nontrivial spaces
are the maximal parabolics of G2 .
    Let x be a traceless Octonion such that x2 = 0. Let P1 be the maximal parabolic
subgroup of G2 (F ) stabilizing the line F x. The Levi factor of P1 is ”spanned” by a long
root. Consider
                               B = {(ax, 0)|a ∈ F and a 6= 0}.
10                        KAY MAGAARD AND GORDAN SAVIN

Let QQ be the maximal parabolic subgroup of GL2 (F ) stabilizing B. Then P1 × QQ acts
transitively on B and

                          BB = (G2 (F ) × GL2 (F )) ×(P1 ×QQ) B.

Let y and z be two traceless and linearly independent Octonions such that y 2 = z 2 = yz =
0. Let P2 be the maximal parabolic subgroup of G2 (F ) stabilizing the space F y + F z. The
Levi factor of P2 is ”spanned” by a short root. Consider

                  A = {(ay + bz, cy + zd)|a, b, c, d ∈ F and ad − bc 6= 0}.

Then P2 × GL(2) acts transitively on A and since G2 (F ) acts transitively on the set of all
two-dimensional spaces of traceless Octonions with trivial multiplication,

                                      AA = G2 (F ) ×P2 A.

The proposition is proved.
   We can now summarize the structure of VU as a G2 (F )×GL2 (F )-module in the following
theorem (compare [Ku]).
Theorem 4.3. VU has a filtration with three quotients:

                                 Cc∞ (AA), Cc∞ (BB), and VN .

Moreover
     (1)
                             Cc∞ (AA) = indG    ∞

as G2 (F ) × GL2 (F )-modules.
     We are now ready to state and prove the main theorem.
Theorem 4.4. Let Φ : SL3 (C) → G2 (C) be the standard inclusion of the L-groups of
P GL3 (F ) and G2 (F ). Let Y be a tempered spherical representation of P GL3 (F ). Let
s ∈ SL3 (C) be its Satake parameter. Let Ỹ be the tempered spherical representation of
G2 (F ) whose Satake parameter is Φ(s). Then

                                          Θ(Y ) = {Ỹ }.
                           EXCEPTIONAL Θ-CORRESPONDENCES I                                      11

Proof. Write Y = IndGL   Q
                            3
                              X (note that there are up to three different choices for X). Then
the restriction of X to GL2 (F ) (a factor of L) is the irreducible spherical representation
whose parameter is (χ| · |1/2 , µ| · |1/2 ) where χ and µ are unitary characters. Let X̃ be the
irreducible spherical representation of GL2 (F ) whose parameter is (χ−1 | · |3/2 , µ−1 | · |3/2 ).
Note that Cc∞ (A) is the regular representation of GL(2). After taking into account the
twist with | det |2 it follows that there is a unique quotient of Cc∞ (AA) isomorphic to X̃ ⊗X
as a GL2 (F ) × GL2 (F )-module. Here the first copy of GL2 (F ) is the Levi factor of P2 and
the second is the factor of L. Therefore,

                                         IndG
                                            P2 (X̃) ⊗ X
                                              2




is a quotient of Cc∞ (AA). Write Ỹ = IndGP2 X̃. Let U2 be the unipotent radical of P2 . It
                                           2


is Heisenberg group. Let Z be the center of U2 . The action of GL2 (F ) (Levi factor of P2 )
on Z is det and on U2 /Z it is isomorphic to S 3 (F 2 ) ⊗ det−1 . It follows that ρU2 = | det |3 .
Hence Ỹ is tempered. It is irreducible by a result of Keys [Ke]. We have to show that
Ỹ ⊗ X is a quotient of VU and that X does not appear as a quotient composition factors
of VU different from Cc∞ (AA).
   We again use Lemma 2.5, but in this case T will be in the Bernstein center (see [BD])
of GL2 (F ) ⊆ L. Recall that the component of the Bernstein center corresponding to
representations generated by their Iwahori-fixed vectors is isomorphic to

                                       C[x, x−1 , y, y −1]W

where W = {1, w}, w(x) = y and w(y) = x is the Weyl group of GL2 . Let I be the Iwahori
subgroup of GL2 (F ). Let ̟ be the uniformizing element in F . Then any unramified
character χ of F ∗ is determined by its value on ̟. If E is a subquotient of an induced
representation with the parameter (χ1 , χ2 ) then

                      (x + y) = χ1 (̟) + χ2 (̟) and xy = χ1 (̟)χ2 (̟)

on E. Let
                                T1 = q 3/2 (x−1 + y −1 ) − (xy)−1 ,
where q = |̟|−1 . On X T1 acts as the scalar

                          q 2 (χ(̟)−1 + µ(̟)−1 ) − qχ(̟)−1 µ(̟)−1 ,

which if real, is strictly less then 2q 2 . On the other hand, Cc∞ (B) is the regular represen-
tation of GL1 , so Cc∞ (B) as a GL2 (F )-module consists of induced representations whose
inducing parameters are (| · |3/2 , χ). It has an Iwahori-fixed vector only when χ is an
unramified character. On such induced representations T1 acts as

                           q 3 = q 3/2 (q 3/2 + χ(̟)−1 ) − q 3/2 χ(̟)−1 .
12                        KAY MAGAARD AND GORDAN SAVIN

Hence T1 acts on Cc∞ (B)I as the scalar q 3 , which is always bigger then 2q 2 . Therefore X
can not be a quotient of Cc∞ (B).
  Let
                                        T2 = xy.

Then T2 acts on X as |̟|χ(̟)µ(̟) which is different from |̟|2 and |̟|4 , the eigenvalues
of T2 on VNI . Therefore X can not be a quotient of VN . Finally, Lemma 2.5 applied to T1
and T2 shows that Ỹ ⊗ X is a quotient of VU .
   To finish the proof we have to check that the correspondence Y → Ỹ is Langlands.
Since Ỹ = IndG P2 X̃ and P2 is spanned by a short root, the Satake parameter of Ỹ sits in
                 2


a Levi factor of a parabolic subgroup of G2 (C) spanned by a long root. Since SL3 (C) is
spanned by long roots of G2 , Ỹ must be a lift of a representation of P GL3 (F ) induced
from Q: Y or Y ∗ . Note that replacing the pair (χ, µ) by (χ−1 , µ−1 ) does not change Ỹ
but replaces Y by Y ∗ . The theorem is proved.

                           5. Dual pair G2 (F ) × P GSp6 (F )
   Let G be the simply connected group of type E7 . Let P = M N be the maximal
parabolic subgroup of G such that M is the reductive group of type E6 discussed in the
last section. The nilpotent radical N is commutative and isomorphic to J as an M -module.
Let G2 (F ) × GL3 (F ) be the dual pair in M , described in Section 4. The centralizer of
G2 (F ) in G is Sp(6). This can be easily seen on the level of Lie algebras. Let g be the Lie
algebra of G. Then
                                       g = n̄ + m + n

and write
                                  Cg (G2 (F )) = ū + l + u

where l ⊂ m, u ⊂ n and u ⊂ n. Then l = gl(3) and u ⊂ n corresponds to the inclusion
JF ⊂ J since
                                 J G2 (F ) = JF .

Therefore Cg (G2 (F )) = sp(6) whose Siegel parabolic subalgebra is l + u. Note also that
we have a distinguished SL2 ,

                                  SL2 (F ) ⊂ Sp6 (F ) ⊂ G

such that if (e, h, f ) is the standard basis of sl(2) (the Lie algebra of SL2 ) then h ∈ m,
f ∈ n and e ∈ n. Moreover e corresponds to the unit element of J under the identification
of n and J. Let GA be the split adjoint group of type E7 , and let PA = MA N be the
corresponding maximal parabolic subgroup. Then MA can be defined as the group of
isogenies of the Dickson form. We have a dual pair G2 (F ) × P GSp6 (F ) ⊂ GA . Note that
P GSp6 (F ) is generated by the distinguished P GL2 (F ) ⊂ P GSp6 (F ) and the image of
Sp6 (F ).

   Let Q = GL3 (F )U be the Siegel parabolic subgroup of Sp6 (F ) and QA = LU be the
corresponding maximal parabolic of P GSp6 (F ). Let V be the minimal representation of
GA . We want to compute VU . Since

                                         0 → Cc∞ (ω)U → VU → VN → 0

we need to understand Cc∞ (ω)U . Let N N and N N be the orthogonal complements of U
and U in N and N . Since U can be identified with JF , it follows that
                                                 
                                   0 x          y
                           NN = { x 0
                                               z  | x = −x, y = −y and z = −z}.
                                   y z          0

Let ωω = ω ∩ N N . As in Lemma 2.2 Cc∞ (ω)U = Cc∞ (ωω) and we have:
Proposition 5.1. Identify N N with the set of triples of traceless Octonions (x, y, z). Let
f ∈ Cc∞ (ωω). The action of G2 (F ) × L is given by

                         π(g)f ((x, y, z)) = f ((g −1 x, g −1 y, g −1z)),          g ∈ G2 (F ).

Proof. It follows from Theorem 1.1. Note, however, that in this case the formulas are
describing the action on Cc∞ (ωω).
  To keep our notation simple we work in G. We have to understand the structure of
G2 (F ) × GL3 (F ) orbits on ωω which is, of course, the same as the structure of orbits on
ωω = ω ∩ N N .
Proposition 5.2.
   (1) ωω = {(x, y, z)|x = −x, y = −y, z = −z and x2 = y 2 = z 2 = xy = xz = yz = 0}.
   (2) Let AA and BB be the subsets of ωω consisting of all triples (x, y, z) such that the
       space F x + F y + F z has dimension 2 and 1 respectively. Then AA and BB are
       G2 (F ) × GL3 (F )-orbits and

                                                ωω = AA ∪ BB.

Proof. Let us prove the corresponding statement for ωω. Let
                                                
                                      0    x y
                               n =  −x 0 z  ∈ ωω.
                                     −y −z 0
Since n is a traceless matrix in J it will be singular iff n2 = 0. But this is equivalent to
x2 = y 2 = z 2 = xy = xz = yz = 0. The first part of the proposition is proved.
   Again, recall that G2 has three orbits on the set of spaces of traceless Octonions with
the property that the Octonion multiplication is trivial. These are characterized by their
dimension; the possible choices being 0, 1, 2. The stabilizers of the nontrivial spaces are
the maximal parabolics of G2 . It follows that x, y and z are linearly dependent. hence
ωω = AA ∪ BB. It remains to show that AA and BB are single orbits. The proof is
analogous to the proof of Proposition 4.2.
   Let x be a traceless Octonion such that x2 = 0. Let P1 be the maximal parabolic
subgroup of G2 (F ) stabilizing the line F x. Consider
                             B = {(ax, 0, 0)|a ∈ F and a 6= 0}.
Let Q1 be the maximal parabolic of GL3 (F ) stabilizing B. Then P1 × Q1 acts transitively
on B and
                        BB = (G2 (F ) × GL3 (F )) ×(P1 ×Q1 ) B.
Let y and z be two traceless and linearly independent Octonions such that y 2 = z 2 = yz =
0. Let P2 be the maximal parabolic subgroup of G2 (F ) stabilizing the space F y + F z.
Consider
                A = {(ay + bz, cy + dz, 0)|a, b, c, d ∈ F and ad − bc 6= 0}.
Let Q2 be the maximal parabolic subgroup of GL3 (F ) stabilizing A. Then P2 × Q2 acts
transitively on A and
                           AA = (G2 (F ) × GL3 (F )) ×(P2 ×Q2 ) A.
The proposition is proved.
     We can now summarize the structure of VU as a G2 (F ) × GL3 (F )-module.
Theorem 5.3. VU has a filtration with three subquotients:
                               Cc∞ (AA), Cc∞ (BB), and VN .

as G2 (F ) × GL3 (F )-modules. Here det denotes the usual determinant of 3 × 3 matrices.
   We are now ready to state and prove the main theorem.
Theorem 5.4. Let Φ : G2 (C) → Spin7 (C) be the standard inclusion of the L-groups of
G2 (F ) and P GSp6 (F ); G2 (C) fixes a non-zero vector in the 8-dimensional spin representa-
tion of Spin7 (C). Let Y ′ be a tempered spherical representation of P GSp6 (F ). Then Θ(Y ′ )
is not empty only if the Satake parameter of Y ′ is Φ(s) for some s, a Satake parameter of
a tempered spherical representation Ỹ of G2 (F ). In that case

                                         Θ(Y ′ ) = {Ỹ }.


Proof. Let X ′ be a spherical tempered representation of P GSp6 (F ). Recall that every
tempered spherical representation of P GSp6 (F ) is fully induced (see [T1]). To sim-
plify notation we work with Sp6 (F ). The restriction of X ′ to Sp6 (F ) can be written
as IndSp             2
       Q X ⊗ | det | where X is a tempered spherical representation of GL3 (F ) (note that
         6


ρU = | det |2 ).
   Let Y ′ be a spherical tempered representation of P GSp6 (F ) whose Satake parameter is
Φ(s). This means that the restriction of Y ′ to Sp6 (F ) can be written as IndSp                2
                                                                                  Q (Y ⊗| det | )
                                                                                     6


where Y is a tempered spherical representation of P GL3 (F ). Also Ỹ , the representation of
G2 (F ) whose parameter is s, is the lift of Y from P GL3 (F ). By Theorem 5.3, VM ⊗ | det |2
is a quotient of VU (M is a group of type E6 ). It follows from the Frobenius reciprocity
that Ỹ ∈ Θ(Y ′ ).
   The rest of the theorem follows form the knowledge of VU . Indeed, let X ′ be a tempered
spherical representation of P GSp6 (F ). Again, it is a fully induced representation so its
restriction to Sp6 (F ) can be written as IndSp              2
                                               Q X ⊗ | det | where X is a tempered spherical
                                                 6


representation of GL3 (F ). If Ỹ ⊗ X ′ is a quotient of V for some irreducible representation
Ỹ of G2 (F ), then Ỹ ⊗ (X ⊗ | det |2 ) is a quotient of VU , i.e. it is a quotient of one of the
three pieces in Theorem 5.3. For example, if it is a quotient of Cc∞ (AA) then

                       Ỹ ⊗ (X ⊗ | det |2 ) = IndG                     2
                                                 P2 (X̃) ⊗ (X ⊗ | det | )
                                                   2




where the parameter of X̃ is (| · |3/2 χ−1 , | · |3/2 µ−1 ) and the parameter of X is (χ, µ, χµ)
for some unitary characters χ and µ. Since Ind X ⊗ | det |2 = Ind Y ⊗ | det |2 , where Y is
a representation of P GL3 (F ) with parameter (χ, µ, χ−1 µ−1 ), we are back in the situation
as in the beginning of the proof. The theorem is proved.
   With only minor modifications of the preceeding proof one can easily show the following
proposition.
Proposition 5.5. Let Y be a spherical representation of P GSp6 (F ) which appears as a
quotient of V , the minimal representation of E7 . Then the Satake parameter of Y is Φ(s)
for some s ∈ G2 (C).

                        6. Some facts about Jordan algebras
   In this section we shall describe structure of exceptional groups using simple Jordan
algebras of rank 3.
   Let D be a non-degenerate subalgebra of Octonions. Let JD ⊆ J be the corresponding
Jordan algebra of rank 3. The Dickson form on JD is given by

     6(x, y, z) = 2tr(xyz) − tr(x)tr(yz) − tr(y)tr(zx) − tr(z)tr(xy) − tr(x)tr(y)tr(z).

Define
                      lD = {x ∈ gl(JD ) | (xv, v, v) = 0 for all v ∈ JD }.
   Now assume that D = F , F + F , M2 (F ) (2 × 2-matrices) or O. Let GD be a simply
connected group of type F4 or En , n = 6, 7 or 8 respectively. Let gD be its Lie algebra.
Let ∆ be the Dynkin diagram of gD . We shall identify it with a set of simple roots. Let α̃
be the highest positive root. Let α be the unique simple root not perpendicular to α̃. Let
mD ⊂ gD be the simple algebra whose Dynkin diagram is ∆\{α}. Extend ∆ by adding −α̃.
Let β be the unique simple root not perpendicular to α. Remove the vertex corresponding
to the simple root β. The extended diagram breaks into several pieces, one of which is
an A2 diagram corresponding to {α, −α̃}. Then lD ⊂ gD corresponds to the rest of the
diagram. Consider the adjoint action of sl(3) + lD on gD . One has a decomposition

                           gD = sl(3) + lD + V ⊗ JD + V ∗ ⊗ JD
                                                             ∗


where V is the standard 3-dimensional representation of sl(3) (see [HP]). Let MD and LD
be the corresponding simply connected groups and let HD be a subgroup of LD centralizing
the identity of JD . The possible choices are given by the Freudenthal’s magic square:

                          GD    MD        LD          HD       JD
                          F4    Sp6      SL3          SO3     S2V
                          E6    SL6    SL3 × SL3      SL3    V ⊗V∗
                          E7    E6       SL6          Sp6     ∧2 F 6
                          E8    E7        E6           F4      F 27

In the above table we have identified JD with a ”usual” representation of LD whenever
possible. Since the centralizer of HD in JD is one-dimensional, it follows that the centralizer
of HD in gD is (see [FH])
                                    g2 = sl(3) + V + V ∗ .
                                                                                  0
   Assume that D 6= F . We shall need few facts about the action of HD on JD        , the set of
                                                      0                2
traceless elements in JD . Recall that a point x ∈ JD is singular if x = 0. The group HD
                                                     0
acts transitively on the set of singular vectors in JD . Denote by Q1 a parabolic subgroup
                                       0
of HD stabilizing a singular line in JD .
                     0
   Let F y + F z ⊂ JD  be a singular space, i.e. each point is singular. This is equivalent to

                                      y 2 = z 2 = yz = 0.

                                                                          0
We need to know HD -orbits of singular two-dimensional subspaces of JD      . We have two
different cases.
   If dim D = 2 then JD is isomorphic to the algebra of all 3 × 3-matrices with coefficients
in F and HD = SL3 acts by conjugation. The restriction of the Dickson form to JD is
given by
                                   (x, x, x) = det(x)
                                                                                       0
where det is the determinant of 3 × 3 matrices. In this case, a singular point in JD     is a
nilpotent rank-one matrix. There are two SL3 -orbits of singular two-dimensional spaces.
Let F y + F z be a singular space. Then either the images or the kernels of y and z coincide.
Denote by Q+ or Q− the stabilizer of the singular space depending on the orbit. It is a
maximal parabolic subgroup of SL3 .
   In other cases, a stabilizer of a singular two-dimensional space is a parabolic subgroup
only if the space is ”amber” ([A]).
                          0
Definition 6.1. Let S ⊂ JD  be a singular two-dimensional space. We say that S is amber
if S ⊂ xJD for every x ∈ S.
Proposition 6.2. If dim D ≥ 4 then HD acts transitively on the space of amber two-
                          0
dimensional subspaces of JD .
Proof. If dim D = 8 this is a result of Aschbacher, 9.3-5 [A1]. Let F y + F z = S be an
amber space. Since HD acts transitively on the set of singular vectors, we can assume that
                                               0
z = x, where x is a fixed singular vector in JD  . Let Q1 be a parabolic subgroup of HD
stabilizing the line F x. Let L1 be a Levi factor of Q1 . Let Ix ⊂ JD be an L1 -invariant
space such that
                                          0
                                  xJD ∩ JD   = F x + Ix .

To finish the proof, we have to show that L1 acts transitively on the set of singular points
in Ix .
   If dim D = 4 then L1 = GL2 × SL2 and Ix can be identified with the space of 2 × 2-
matrices. If dim D = 8 then [L1 , L1 ] = Spin7 and Ix is the corresponding 8-dimensional
spin-representation. In both cases L1 has two non-trivial orbits in Ix , the smaller consisting
of singular points. The proposition is proved.
   Let Q2 be the stabilizer of an amber plane. We finish this section with a description of
Q2 in both cases. Identify the amber space with F 2 . Let L2 be a Levi factor of Q2 .
   If dim D = 4 then Q2 is contained in a Siegel parabolic subgroup of Sp(6) and L2 =
GL2 × GL1 . The action of L2 on the amber space is the standard action of GL2 × GL1 on
the space of 2 × 1 matrices.
   If dim D = 8. Then L2 is a quotient of GL3 ×GL2 obtained by identifying centers of both
factors (consider GL3 ×GL2 acting on 3×2 matrices, for example). Let (l3 , l2 ) ∈ GL3 ×GL2 .
The action of L2 on the amber space is given by

                                  det(l3 ) det(l2 )l2 x x ∈ F 2 .
18                          KAY MAGAARD AND GORDAN SAVIN

In particular, the action of L2 on the amber space induces a non-split exact sequence

                                 1 → SL3 → L2 → GL2 → 1.

We have [L2 , L2 ] = SL3 ×SL2 where SL3 is spanned by long roots and SL2 by short roots.

                  7. Jacquet functor for G2 - Heisenberg parabolic
     We continue to use the notation and definitions introduced in the previous section. Let
                                              
                                     1 0 0
                              x =  0 0 0  ∈ sl(3) ⊂ gD .
                                     0 0 −1

Let g(k) = {y ∈ gD |[x, y] = ky}. Then g(k) 6= 0 for k = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2. Let p = m+n be the
maximal parabolic subalgebra with m = g(0) and n = g(1) + g(2). Note that [m, m] = mD
and n is a Heisenberg Lie algebra with center g(2). Let P = M N be the corresponding
maximal parabolic subgroup. Let Z be the center of N and let ND be the quotient of N
by Z. Then ND is an irreducible MD -module. Since ND ∼     = g(1), the restriction to LD is
isomorphic to
                                                 ∗
                                    F + JD + JD    + F.
     The centralizer of HD in GD is G2 (F ), and

                                 G2 (F ) ∩ P = P2 = GL2 (F )U2

is the Heisenberg parabolic of G2 (F ). Then Z ⊂ U2 and let U be the quotient of U2 by Z.
    Let Ω be the set of singular vectors in ND . Let N denote the opposite nilpotent
subgroup. Let N D , Z... be the corresponding objects attached to N . Note that the
Killing form on gD , the Lie algebra of GD , defines a non-degenerate pairing < ·, · >
between ND and N D .
Theorem 7.1. Assume that the residual characteristic of F is odd. Let V be the minimal
representation of GD . Let Z be the center of N as above. Then VZ has a P -invariant
filtration
                             0 → Cc∞ (Ω) → VZ → VN → 0
where Cc∞ (Ω) denotes the space of locally constant, compactly supported functions on Ω.
   (1) Let f ∈ Cc∞ (Ω). Then

In the above formulas det is the determinant of the representation of M on ND , d is the
dimension of ND and the values of s and t are given in the following table.

Proof. Part (2) is Prop. 4.1 [S]. Let W be the kernel of the projection of VZ onto VN . Let
x ∈ N D and let
                                    ψx (y) = ψ(< x, y >)
be a character of N . The theorem of Moeglin and Waldspurger [MW] implies that
dim WN,ψx = 0 or 1 and it is one if and only if x ∈ Ω. Let x ∈ Ω. Let Mx be the
stabilizer of x in M and χ the character of Mx describing the action of Mx on WN,ψx . By
Frobenius reciprocity there exists a non-trivial P -homomorphism

                                T : W → IndP
                                           Mx N (χ ⊗ ψx ).


Let C ∞ (Ω) denote the space of locally constant functions on Ω. Note that we have an
inclusion
                              IndP                  ∞
                                  Mx N (χ ⊗ ψx ) ⊆ C (Ω).

Let w ∈ W and f = T (w). We need to show that f is a compactly supported function on
Ω. Let ND,k , k ∈ Z be a family of lattices of ND such that ∪k ND,k = ND and ∩k ND,k = 0.
Let N D,k be their dual lattices in N D . Since W is a smooth module, there exists a small
integer k depending on w such that π(n)w = w for all n ∈ ND,k . This implies that f is
supported inside N D,k . Since WN = 0 there exists an integer l depending on w such that
                                    Z
                                            π(n)wdn = 0
                                     ND,l


(see 2.33 [BZ]). This implies that f is supported outside N D,k . Since Ω is locally closed
and the boundary is {0}, it follows that f ∈ Cc∞ (Ω). Let ind denote smooth induction
with compact support. By the Bernstein-Zelevinsky analogue of Mackey Theory (see [BZ],
pages 46-47)
                                indP                 ∞
                                   Mx N (χ ⊗ ψx ) = Cc (Ω)

is irreducible P -module. Hence T (W ) = Cc∞ (Ω). Let W ′ be the kernel of T . Since

                              dim WN,ψx = dim Cc∞ (Ω)N,ψx

                                   ′
for any x ∈ N D , it follows that WN,ψ x
                                         = 0 for any x ∈ N D (2.35 [BZ]). Therefore W ′ = 0
by 5.14 [BZ].

   Note that the inclusion Mx → M induces an isomorphism Mx /[Mx , Mx ] ∼     = M/[M, M ]
This can be easily checked by choosing x to be in gD,α ⊂ g(1), α is defined in the previous
section. Hence χ is a character of M and to finish the proof we have to show that
                                                      s

Let GL2 (F ) be the Levi factor of P2 defined above. The inclusion of GL2 (F ) into M induces
in isomorphism GL2 (F )/SL2 (F ) ∼  = M/[M, M ]. This can be seen by looking at the action
of GL2 (F ) and M on Z. Therefore it suffices to find the restriction of χ to GL2 (F ). In
Section 8 we shall use the information on correspondences obtained in previous sections to
find the character.

   Let N N be the orthogonal complement of U in ND . Let JD     be the set of traceless

  (2) Let AA and BB be the subsets of ΩΩ consisting of all pairs (y, z) such that the
      space F y + F z has dimension 2 and 1 respectively. Then BB is a GL2 (F ) × HD -
      orbit. If dim D ≥ 4 then AA is a GL2 (F ) × HD -orbit. If dim D = 2 then AA is a
      union of two orbits.

Proof. Recall that a two-dimensional space S ⊂ JD is amber if every element is singular
and
                                       S ⊂ xJD
for all x ∈ S. As before, write
                                                    ∗
                                     ND = F + JD + JD + F.
Let QD = LUD ⊆ MD be the stabilizer of the last summand in the above decomposition.
Then [L, L] = LD , UD ∼
                      = JD as an LD -module and QD stabilizes the partial flag
                                          ∗        ∗
                               ND ⊃ JD + JD + F ⊃ JD + F ⊃ F.
More precisely, let u ∈ UD , (a, y, z, b) ∈ ND and (a′ , y ′ , z ′ , b′ ) = u(a, y, z, b). Then
                         a′ = a, y ′ = y + au, z ′ = z + 2u × y + au × u,
                               b′ = b + tr(uy) + 3(u, u, z) + a det u,
where det u = (u, u, u) and u × y, the cross product, is an element of JD such that
                                      tr((u × y)x) = 3(x, y, u)
for all x ∈ JD (see [Ki] page 143).

Lemma 7.3. The group QD has 4 orbits on Ω. Their representatives are

                              v1 = (1, 0, 0, 0), v2 = (0, x, 0, 0)

                              v3 = (0, 0, x, 0), v4 = (0, 0, 0, 1)
where x is any singular element in JD .
Proof. Note that P(Ω) = MD /QD . We have to compute QD \MD /QD which is the same
as WL \WM /WL , here WM and WL denote the Weyl groups of MD and LD . Since ND
is a miniscule representation i.e. weight vectors are all contained in one WM -orbit, it
follows that they are parametrized by WM /WL . On the other hand JD is a miniscule
representation of LD so WL \WM /WL has four orbits and it follows easily that vi , (1 ≤
i ≤ 4) form a complete set of representatives of QD -orbits. The lemma is proved.
  Let (0, y, z, 0) ∈ ΩΩ. If y 6= 0 then Lemma 7.3 implies that it is QD conjugated to v2 .
Therefore y is in the L-orbit of x, hence y is singular. Since the action of GL2 (F ) is
                                        
                                     a b
                            (y, z)         = (ay + cz, by + dz)
                                     c d

the same argument implies that any element of F y + F z is singular.
   Note that (0, y, z, 0) is QD , hence UD -conjugated to (0, y, 0, 0). But this means that
z = 2u × y for some u ∈ UD ∼  = JD such that tr(uy) = 0. Since tr((u × y)v) = 3(u, y, v) for
all elements v ∈ JD and

                            6(u, y, v) = 2tr(uyv) − tr(u)tr(yv)

(use tr(y) = tr(uy) = 0), it follows that

                                 tr((2u × y)v) = tr(u∗ yv)

for all v ∈ JD , here u∗ = 2u − tr(u). Therefore z = u∗ y ∈ yJD . Since the same argument
can be repeated for any linear combination of y and z, the first part of the proposition
follows.

   Let x ∈ JD    such that x2 = 0. Let Q1 be the parabolic subgroup of HD stabilizing the

Let QQ ⊂ GL2 (F ) be the Borel subgroup stabilizing the line B. Then QQ × Q1 acts

Then GL2 (F ) × Q2 acts transitively on A and

                                         AA = HD ×Q2 A.

If dim D = 2 then we have two orbits of singular two-dimensional spaces. Let F y + + F z +
and F y − + F z − be their representatives and Q+ and Q− their stabilizers in SL3 (F ). One
can define A+ and A− as above, hence

                          AA = SL3 (F ) ×Q+ A+ ∪ SL3 (F ) ×Q− A− .

In fact, the isogeny class of HD determines the isogeny class of GD and vice-versa. Note
that the action of HD on Cc∞ (ΩΩ) is geometric. It comes from the (algebraic) action of HD
     0
on JD  which extends uniquely to the group of adjoint type. Therefore we have a canonical
way of extending the representation V to groups of adjoint type.

                                  8. Θ-lifts from G2 (F )
   In this section we compute Θ-lifts of spherical tempered representations of G2 (F ) in all
three cases. In the process we also compute the normalizing factors (i.e. coefficients s) in
Theorems 7.1 and 7.4. We assume that the residual characteristic of F is odd.
   We study the dual pair G2 (F ) × F4 (F ) in a simple group G of type E8 first. Let Ỹ be a
spherical tempered representation of G2 (F ). Then Ỹ = IndG   P2 (X̃) where X̃ is a spherical
                                                                2


representation of GL2 (F ) with the parameter (χ−1 | · |3/2 , µ−1 | · |3/2 ). As before, χ and µ
must be unitary characters. Let Q2 = L2 V2 be the maximal parabolic subgroup of F4 (F )
stabilizing an amber projective line. In Section 6 we have shown that the action of L2 on
the corresponding amber line gives an exact sequence

                                1 → SL3 → L2 → GL2 → 1.

One checks that ρV2 = | det |7 , here det is the usual determinant on GL2 . Let X be a
spherical representation of GL2 with the parameter (χ| · |7/2 , µ| · |7/2 ). Pull X back to L2 .
Let
                                      W = IndF Q2 X.
                                                4



Note that W is a unitarizable representation of F4 (F ). It is quite possible that W is always
irreducible but we do not know.
Theorem 8.1. Let Ỹ be a spherical tempered representation of G2 (F ) and W the rep-
resentation of F4 (F ) defined above. Then Θ(Ỹ ) 6= {} and if W ′ ∈ Θ(Ỹ ) then W ′ is a
summand of W . Let s ∈ G2 (C) be the Satake parameter of Ỹ . Then the Satake parameter
of W is Ψ(s × ρ) where Ψ : G2 (C) × SO3 (C) → F4 (C) and ρ ∈ SO3 (C) is the Satake
parameter of the trivial representation of SL2 (F ).
Proof. Let P = M N be the maximal parabolic subalgebra of G studied in the last two
sections. We described an embedding of the dual pair G2 (F ) × F4 (F ) in G such that
G2 (F ) ∩ P is the Heisenberg maximal parabolic subgroup P2 .
   Yet another embedding of the dual pair G2 (F )×F4 (F ) is given by the inclusion of Jordan
algebras JF → J (use the description of the exceptional Lie algebras given in Section 6).
In this case, G2 (F ) ⊂ M and F4 (F ) ∩ P = Q4 = L4 V4 , the Heisenberg maximal parabolic
subgroup of F4 (F ). The Levi component L4 is isomorphic to GSp6 (F ). Note that the
inclusion GSp6 (F ) → M induces an isomorphism GSp6 (F )/Sp6 (F ) ∼    = M/[M, M ]. This is
easily seen by considering the action of GSp6 (F ) and M on Z, the center of both, V4 and
N.

generic choice of χ and µ, X̃ ⊗ W ′ will be a quotient of Cc∞ (AA). Since Cc∞ (A) is a regular
representation of GL2 (F ) twisted by δ, X̃ ⊗ W ′ must be a quotient of
                                        X̃ ⊗ IndF
                                                Q2 X

where X is a representation of L2 pulled back from a representation of GL2 (F ) with a
parameter (χδ| · |−3/2 , µδ| · |−3/2 ). We get that W ′ is a subquotient of both, IndF    ′
                                                                                     Q4 (Y ⊗
                                                                                       4


| det |3 ) and IndF
                  Q2 X. This immediately implies that
                    4



                                      δ(det) = | det |5 .
The knowledge of δ implies that any X̃ is a quotient of Cc∞ (AA) only and, therefore Θ-lifts
of Ỹ are the summands of W .
   It remains to check the statement about Satake parameters. The L-group of F4 (F ) is
F4 (C). Let Q3 = L3 V3 be the maximal parabolic subgroup of F4 such that [L3 , L3 ] =
SL2 × SL3 where SL2 is spanned by long roots and SL3 by short roots. Since L3 (C) is
the L-group of L2 , it fits into exact sequence
                               1 → GL2 → L3 → P GL3 → 1.
Let s ∈ GL2 (C) be the parameter (χ, µ). Obviously, the Satake parameter of W is s × ρ ∈
GL2 × SO(3) ⊂ L3 . Let G2 be the centralizer of SO(3) in F4 . Then L3 ∩ G2 = GL2 and
s is precisely the Satake parameter of Ỹ as in Section 4.
  Theorem 7.4 can be used, in a similar way, to prove converses of Theorems 4.4 and 5.4.
We state results without giving details of proofs.
Theorem 8.2. Let Φ : SL3 (C) → G2 (C) be the inclusion of the L-groups of P GL3 (F )
and G2 (F ). Let Ỹ be a tempered spherical representation of G2 (F ). The Satake parameter
of Ỹ is Φ(s) for some s, a Satake parameter of a tempered spherical representation Ỹ of
G2 (F ). Note that Φ(s) = Φ(s∗ ) where s∗ is a Satake parameter of Y ∗ , the dual of Y . Then
                                      Θ(Ỹ ) = {Y, Y ∗ }.

Theorem 8.3. Let Φ : G2 (C) → Spin7 (C) be the inclusion of the L-groups of G2 (F ) and
P GSp6 (F ). Let Ỹ be a tempered spherical representation of G2 (F ). Then
                                        Θ(Ỹ ) = {Y ′ }
where Y ′ is the spherical tempered representation of P GSp6 (F ) whose Satake parameter
is Φ(s).
