1    Introduction
In the past three decades, the theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their
representations has been the focus of extensive research activities due to its rich and
significant applications to many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. The
most well-known examples are Kac-Moody algebras ([27], [48]) and generalized Kac-
Moody algebras ([5]), and a lot of exciting new discoveries have been made using the
language of these infinite dimensional Lie algebras. For example, the Macdonald iden-
tities ([45]) were shown to be equivalent to the denominator identities of affine Kac-
Moody algebras ([28]), and the Moonshine Conjecture was proved by investigating the
structure of a special kind of generalized Kac-Moody algebra called the Monster Lie
algebra ([6]).
    On the other hand, since 1970’s, the Lie superalgebras and their representations
have emerged naturally as the fundamental algebraic structure behind several areas of
mathematical physics. In [29], V. G. Kac gave a comprehensive presentation of the
mathematical theory of Lie superalgebras, and obtained an important classification
theorem for finite dimensional simple Lie superalgebras over algebraically closed fields
of characteristic zero (see also [53]). The theories of Kac-Moody algebras and gener-
alized Kac-Moody algebras have been extended to those of Kac-Moody superalgebras
([30]) and generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras ([47], [51]) following the outline given in
[31]. In [34] and [35], V. G. Kac and M. Wakimoto developed the representation theory
of affine Kac-Moody superalgebras, and demonstrated some interesting applications of
affine Kac-Moody superalgebras to number theory.
    In [37], S.-J. Kang derived a closed form root multiplicity formula for generalized
Kac-Moody algebras, and by applying his formula to the Monster Lie algebra, he ob-
tained some interesting recursive relations among the coefficients of the elliptic modular
function j. The main idea of [37] is that the Euler-Poincaré principle for the Lie alge-
bra homology can be interpreted as the denominator identity for Kac-Moody algebras
or generalized Kac-Moody algebras, and once we are given the denominator identity,
we can derive a root multiplicity formula. This idea has been extended to the general
infinite dimensional graded Lie algebras to yield a closed form dimension formula for
the homogeneous subspaces ([42]), and a lot of interesting applications of our formula
to various classes of infinite dimensional Lie algebras have been investigated (see also
[38] and [41]). In [32], V. G. Kac and S.-J. Kang exploited this idea further to derive a
closed form trace formula for graded Lie algebras with group actions. In particular, by
applying their trace formula to the Monster simple group acting on the Monster Lie
algebra, they obtained a family of interesting recursive relations among the coefficients
of the Thompson series.
    The Thompson series are examples of replicable functions which are normalized q-
series satisfying certain functional equations called the replication formulae. In [40],
S.-J. Kang showed that, given the denominator identity for graded Lie superalgebras,

                                            2
one can derive a closed form superdimension formula for the homogeneous subspaces,
which can be considered as a unifying method of studying the structure of infinite
dimensional Lie superalgebras. He discussed a lot of interesting applications of our
superdimension formula to various classes of infinite dimensional Lie superalgebras
such as free Lie superalgebras, generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras, and Monstrous
Lie superalgebras. Furthermore, he characterized the replicable functions in terms of
certain product identities, and determined the root multiplicities of the Monstrous Lie
superalgebras associated with replicable functions.
    In this paper, we combine the main ideas of [32] and [40] to derive a closed form
supertrace formula for graded Lie superalgebras with group actions. More precisely, let
Γ be a countable (ususally infinite) abelian semigroup and A be a countable (usually
finite) abelian group such that every element (α, a) ∈ Γ × A can be written as a sum of
elements in Γ × A in only finitely many ways. Suppose that a group G acts on a graded
                       L
Lie superalgebra L = (α,a)∈Γ×A L(α,a) by Lie superalgebra automorphisms preserving
the (Γ × A)-gradation. Then, in Section 2, we show that the Euler-Poincaré principle
for the Lie superalgebra homology yields a product identity
                                       ∞
                                                                    !
                         Y            X   1      k           k(α,a)
                               exp −        str(g |L(α,a) )E
                                          k
                     (α,a)∈Γ×A        k=1
                                        X
                               =1−            str(g|H(L)(α,a) )E (α,a) ,
                                      (α,a)∈Γ×A


which is called the generalized denominator identity for g ∈ G. By taking the logarithm
of both sides of the generalized denominator identity and using Möbius inversion, we
derive a closed form formula for the supertraces str(g|L(α,a) ) = ψ(a)tr(g|L(α,a) ) for all
g ∈ G, (α, a) ∈ Γ × A (Theorem 2.4):
                                              X           1
                        str(g|L(α,a) ) =                    µ(d)Wgd (τ, b),
                                               d>0
                                                          d
                                           (α,a)=d(τ,b)


where ψ(a) is the sign map defined on A and Wg (τ, b) is the Witt partition function
defined by (2.16).
    In Section 3, we present the standard homology theory for Lie superalgebras. That
is, we show that there exists a super-analogue of Koszul’s complex for Lie superalgebras
(Proposition 3.1). The k-th homology module Hk (L, V ) of the Lie superalgebra L with
coefficients in V is defined by

                        Hk (L, V ) = TorUk (V, C) = Hk (V ⊗U M),

where M = (Mk , ∂k ) is the super-analogue of Koszul’s complex given by (3.1) and (3.2),
and U = U(L) denotes the universal enveloping algebra of L. In particular, if L(V ) is
the free Lie superalgebra generated by a superspace V , then we have H1 (L(V )) = V

                                                 3
and Hk (L(V )) = 0 for all k ≥ 2. Even though our presentation is a straightforward
generalization of the homology theory of Lie algebras (cf. [10], [15]), we decided to
include the detailed treatment here, for we could not find it in any other literature.
    Section 4 and Section 5 are devoted to the applications of our supertrace formula
to free Lie superalgebras. In Section 4, we generalize the classical Witt formula for free
Lie algebras to obtain a closed form supertrace formula for free Lie superalgebras with
group actions. As an application, we compare the structure of the free Lie algebras
and free Lie superalgebras generated by the same group representations (Proposition
4.2). In Section 5, we consider the free Lie superalgebra L(V ) generated by the natural
(k + l)-dimensional representation V of the general linear Lie superalgebra gl(k, l), and
determine the decomposition of L(V ) into a direct sum of irreducible GL(k) × GL(l)-
modules (Proposition 5.3 and Proposition 5.4). The Hook Schur functions and the
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are the key ingredients of the decomposition.
    In Section 6 and Section 7, we give a conjectural Kostant-type formula for the
homology of the negative part of generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras, and derive a
closed form supertrace formula for generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras with group
actions preserving the root space decomposition (Theorem 6.5). Moreover, we apply
our supertrace formula to determine the supertraces of the Monstrous Lie superal-
gebras with group actions preserving the root space decomposition (Proposition 7.1
and Corollary 7.2). We believe that the product identities characterizing the replica-
ble functions ([40]) can be understood most naturally as the generalized denominator
identities of some Mosntrous Lie superalgebra with a suitable group action.
    In Section 8 and Section 9, we prove that the generalized characters of Verma
modules and irreducible highest weight modules over a generalized Kac-Moody super-
algebra g corresponding to the Dynkin diagram automorphism σ are the same as the
usual characters of Verma modules and irreducible highest weight modules over the
orbit Lie superalgebra ğ = g(σ) determined by σ (Theorem 9.3 and Corollary 9.4).
This fact was first proved in [13] for symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras under the
linking condition in solving the fixed point problem in conformal field theory and was
generalized to generalized Kac-Moody algebras without the linking condition in [14].
In this paper, we also show that the generalized denominator identity for a generalized
Kac-Moody superalgebra g for the Dynkin diagram automorphism σ is the same as
the usual denominator identity for the orbit Lie superalgebra ğ = g(σ) (Theorem 9.5).
Our argument for generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras is similar to those in [13] and
[14]. We observe that the generalized character of a Verma module can be written as
the product part of a generalized denominator identity and derive an explicit formula
for the traces of σ on each invariant subspaces (which are not the same as root spaces
in general) of g in terms of the dimensions of some orbit Lie superalgebras. Therefore,
we obtain a dimension formula for each homogeneous subspaces of the invariant sub-
algebra, which is also a generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra with a natural grading

2       Graded Lie Superalgebras and Supertrace For-
        mula
We recall some basic facts about Lie superalgebras ([29], [40], [53]). Let A be a count-
able abelian group and suppose we have a bimultiplicative map θ : A × A −→ C×
satisfying
                           θ(a + b, c) = θ(a, c)θ(b, c),
(2.1)                      θ(a, b + c) = θ(a, b)θ(a, c),
                           θ(a, b)θ(b, a) = 1 for all a, b ∈ A.
In particular, we have θ(a, a) = ±1 for all a ∈ A. The map θ satisfying the condition
(2.1) is called a coloring map on A. Define a map ψ : A −→ {±1} by ψ(a) = θ(a, a).
Then ψ is a well-defined group homomorphism called the sign map on A with respect
to θ. Let A0 = { a ∈ A | ψ(a) = 1 } and A1 = { a ∈ A | ψ(a) = −1 }. Then we have a
decomposition A = A0 ∪ A1 and the elements of A in A0 (resp. A1 ) are called even
(resp. odd ).
                                                      L
    A θ-colored superspace is a pair (V, θ), where V = a∈A Va is an A-graded vector
space and θ : A × A → C× is a coloring map on A. The elements of Va are called
even (resp. odd) if ψ(a) = 1 (resp. ψ(a) = −1). For each a ∈ A, we define the
superdimension of Va to be
(2.2)                             sdimVa = ψ(a)dimVa .
                                                                                 L
    Similarly, we define a θ-colored superalgebra to be a pair (U, θ), where U = a∈A Ua
is an A-graded associative algebra (i.e., Ua Ub ⊂ Ua+b for all a, b ∈ A) and θ : A × A →
C× is a coloring map on A. The direct sum of A-graded superalgebras is defined in
                                                        L                    L
the usual way, but, for θ-colored superalgebras U = a∈A Ua and U ′ = a′ ∈A Ua′ , we
define the tensor product of U and U ′ to be the θ-colored superspace U ⊗ U ′ with the
natural A-gradation
                    (U ⊗ U ′ )a+a′ = Span{u ⊗ u′ | u ∈ Ua , u′ ∈ Ua′ ′ }
and the multiplication given by
                         (u ⊗ u′ )(v ⊗ v ′ ) = θ(a′ , b)(uv ⊗ u′ v ′ )

                                              5

Definition 2.1 A θ-colored Lie superalgebra is a θ-colored superspace L =                       a∈A   La
together with a bilinear operation [ , ] : L × L → L satisfying
                               [La , Lb ] ⊂ La+b ,
(2.3)                          [x, y] = −θ(a, b)[y, x],
                               [x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] + θ(a, b)[y, [x, z]]
for all x ∈ La , y ∈ Lb , z ∈ L and a, b ∈ A.
               L                     L
   Let L0 =       a∈A0 La and L 1 =     b∈A1 Lb . Then we have a decomposition L =
L0 ⊕ L1 , and the homogeneous elements of L0 (resp. L1 ) are called even (resp. odd).
                                                                           L
   The universal enveloping algebra of a θ-colored Lie superalgebra L = a∈A La is
the pair (U(L), ι), where U(L) is a θ-colored superalgebra and ι : L → U(L) is a linear
mapping satisfying

                 ι([x, y]) = ι(x)ι(y) − θ(a, b)ι(y)ι(x) for x ∈ La , y ∈ Lb
                                                 L
such that for any θ-colored superalgebra U = a∈A Ua and a linear mapping j : L → U
satisfying
                j([x, y]) = j(x)j(y) − θ(a, b)j(y)j(x) for x ∈ La , y ∈ Lb ,
there exits a unique homomorphism ψ : U(L) → U of θ-colored superalgebras satisfying
ψ ◦ ι = j.
   The uniqueness of the universal enveloping algebra U(L) can be proved in the usual
                                                            L
way. For the existence, consider the tensor algebra T (L) = ∞ k=0 L
                                                                   ⊗k
                                                                      of L and let R
be the ideal of T (L) generated by the elements of the form

               [x, y] − x ⊗ y + θ(a, b)y ⊗ x (x ∈ La , y ∈ Lb , a, b ∈ A).
                                         
Then the quotient algebra U(L) = T (L) R together with the natural mapping ι : L →
U(L) is the universal enveloping algebra of L.
    For the structure of the universal enveloping algebra U(L) of L, the following version
of Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem is well-known.

Remark. The theory of colored Lie superalgebras can be reduced to the theory of
ordinary Z2 -graded Lie superalgebras by redefining the superbracket in a suitable way.
More precisely, let L = (L, [ , ]) be a θ-colored Lie superalgebra with a coloring map
θ : A × A −→ C× and let X = {xi | i = 1, 2, · · · } be an ordered set of generators of A.
We define the bimultiplicative maps δ : A × A −→ C× and τ : A × A −→ C× by

                                 δ(a, b) = (−1)ψ(a)ψ(b) θ(b, a)

and                                            Y
                                  τ (a, b) =         δ(xi , xj )ri sj ,
                                               i<j
            P              P
where a =      ri xi , b = si xi ∈ A (ri , si ∈ Z). We now introduce a new bracket
     τ
[ , ] : L × L −→ L defined by

                                    [x, y]τ = τ (a, b)[x, y]

for x ∈ La , y ∈ Lb . Then Lτ = (L, [ , ]τ ) becomes an ordinary Z2 -graded Lie su-
peralgebra. Furthermore, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of A-graded
representations of the θ-colored Lie superalgebra L = (L, [ , ]) and the set of A-graded
representations of the ordinary Lie superalgebra Lτ = (L, [ , ]τ ) (cf. [50], [54]).
    Let A be a countable (usually finite) abelian group with a coloring map θ, and let
Γ be a countable (usually infinite) abelian semigroup such that every element (α, a) ∈
Γ×A can be written as a sum of elements in Γ×A in only finitely many ways. Consider
                                               L
a (Γ × A)-graded θ-colored superspace V = (α,a)∈Γ×A V(α,a) with dim V(α,a) < ∞ for
all (α, a) ∈ Γ ×A. Suppose that a group G acts on V preserving the (Γ ×A)-gradation.
We define the generalized character or the graded trace of V for g ∈ G by
                                      X
(2.5)                     chg V =            tr(g|V(α,a) )e(α,a) ,
                                      (α,a)∈Γ×A

where e(α,a) are the basis elements of the semi-group algebra C[Γ × A] with the multi-
plication given by e(α,a) e(β,b) = e(α+β,a+b) .
   On the other hand, we define the supertrace of the homogeneous subspace V(α,a) for
g ∈ G by

(2.6)                          str(g|V(α,a) ) = ψ(a)tr(g|V(α,a) ),

and introduce another basis elements of C[Γ × A] by setting E (α,a) = ψ(a)e(α,a) . Then
it is easy to verify that E (α,a) E (β,b) = E (α+β,a+b) . We now define the generalized super-
character or the graded supertrace of V for g ∈ G by
                                           X
(2.7)                      schg V =               str(g|V(α,a) )E (α,a) .
                                      (α,a)∈Γ×A

Note that schg V is obtained from chg V by replacing tr(g|V(α,a) ) = ψ(a)str(g|V(α,a) ) and
e(α,a) = ψ(a)E (α,a) . Since ψ(a)2 = 1, we have chg V = schg V .

             L
    Let L =     (α,a)∈Γ×A L(α,a) be a θ-colored (Γ × A)-graded Lie superalgebra with
dim L(α,a) < ∞ for all (α, a) ∈ Γ × A and suppose that a group G acts on L by Lie
superalgebra automorphisms preserving the Γ × A-gradation. In this work, using the
Euler-Poincaré principle, which is equivalent to the generalized denominator identity,
we will derive a closed form formula for the supertraces str(g|L(α,a) ) for all g ∈ G,
(α, a) ∈ Γ × A.
    Let C be the trivial one dimensional L-module. The homology modules Hk (L) =
Hk (L, C) are determined from the following standard complex:
                                        d                dk−1                      d

where Ck (L) are defined by
                                                      M
                                       Ck (L) =              Λp (L0 ) ⊗ S q (L1 )
                                                    p+q=k

and the differentials dk : Ck (L) → Ck−1 (L) are given by
         dk ((x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq ))
               X
          =          (−1)s+t ([xs , xt ] ∧ x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xbs ∧ · · · ∧ xbt ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq )

for k ≥ 2, xi ∈ L0 , yj ∈ L1 and d1 = 0 (cf. [10], [15]). In Section 3, we will give a more
detailed treatment of the homology of L. Since the spaces Ck (L) and the homology
modules Hk (L) inherit the (Γ × A)-gradation from that of L, the action of G and
the generalized supercharacters of Ck (L) and Hk (L) are well-defined. Hence by the
Euler-Poincaré principle, we obtain

the alternating direct sum of superspaces. Then it is easy to see that C(L) = Λ(L0 ) ⊗

   We recall the very basic theory of symmetric functions. Let x1 , · · · , xk be indeter-
minates and for each n ∈ N, define

which are called the nth power sum, the nth completely symmetric function, and the
nth elementary symmetric function, respectively. Note that the elementary symmetric
function en is defined only for n ≤ k. To compute the generalized supercharacters of
Λ(L0 ) and S(L1 ), we recall the following fundamental lemma in the theory of symmetric
functions:

Remark. Note that our supertrace formula is a generalization of the trace formula for
graded Lie algebras obtained in [32]. Also, when g = 1, our supertrace formula yields
the superdimension formula for homogeneous subspaces of graded Lie superalgebras
(cf. [40]).




3    Homology of Lie Superalgebras
The homology group of a Lie algebra is defined as the torsion group of its universal
enveloping algebra and characterized by Koszul’s complex. Similarly, we define the
homology group of a graded Lie superalgebra as the torsion group of its universal en-
veloping algebra viewed as a supplmented algebra (cf. [10], [15]). In this section, we
will show that there is a super-analogue of Koszul’s complex for a graded Lie superal-
gebra and characterize its homology group. Our argument follows the framework given
in [10] and [15].
    Let L = L0 ⊕ L1 be a Lie superalgebra and U = U(L) be its universal enveloping
algebra. For each k ≥ 0, define

(3.3)                                               U(L) ≃ S(L0 ) ⊗ Λ(L1 )
as a C-vector space, and the differential maps are simplified to
                    ∂k (u ⊗ (x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq )
                         p
                        X
                     =     (−1)s+1 (u · xs ) ⊗ (x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xbs ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq )
                          s=1
                                      q
                                      X
                                  p
                       + (−1)               (u · yt ) ⊗ (x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · ybt · · · yq ).
                                      t=1

    We define the homotopy map D : Mk → Mk+1 by
            D((u1 · · · us v1 · · · vt ) ⊗ (x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq ))
              Xs
            =     (u1 · · · ubi · · · us v1 · · · vt ) ⊗ (ui ∧ x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq )
                  i=1
                  Xt
             =          (−1)p+t−j (u1 · · · us v1 · · · vbj · · · vt ) ⊗ (x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (vj y1 · · · yq ),
                  j=1


                                                                   13
where ui ∈ L0 and vj ∈ L1 . Then it is easy to verify that
                                    D∂ + ∂D = (p + q + s + t) 1M ,
which implies that our complex M = (Mk , ∂k ) is exact in this case.
Case 2. Let L be any Lie superalgebra. Recall the construction of the universal
                                         L
enveloping algebra of L. Put U n (L) = π( nk=0 L⊗k ), where π : T (L) → U(L) is the
                               (p)
canonical projection map and Xn = U p−n (L) ⊗ Cn (L) for 0 ≤ n ≤ p.
   Consider the complex
                                      ∂p            ∂             (p)   ∂       (p)       ǫ
(3.4)             0 −→ Xp(p) −→ · · · −→
                                       2     1
                                         X1 −→ X0 −→ C −→ 0.
We will use the induction on p to prove the exactness of (3.4), which would imply the
exactness of our original sequence.
   Note that the exactness of (3.4) is equivalent to that of the following sequence:
                                           ∂p           ∂             (p)   ∂       (p)
(3.5)                0 −→ Xp(p) −→ · · · −→
                                          2     1
                                            X1 −→ X0 /C −→ 0.
For p = 0, 1, our assertion is clear. Suppose (3.5) is exact for p − 1. Consider the
diagram
                0                                                 0                             0

   Note that
                                                 
           Xn(p) /Xn(p−1) ≃ U p−n (L)/U p−n−1 (L) ⊗ Cn (L) (0 ≤ n ≤ p − 1)
as a C-vector space, and that, by the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem,
                                            M
                   U p−n (L)/U p−n−1 (L) ≃         S k (L0 ) ⊗ Λl (L1 )
                                                                  k+l=p−n

                                                            (p)
by the canonical homomorphism and Xp                              ≃ C ⊗ Cp (L). Finally, the differentials in
bottom row are given by
           ∂n (u ⊗ (x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq ) + Xn(p−1) )
                p
               X
            =     (−1)s+1 (u · xs ) ⊗ (x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xbs ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq )

                                                             14
Thus the bottom row can be viewed as a subcomplex of the complex considered in
Case 1, and hence it is exact. Therefore, the middle row is exact, which completes our
induction argument.
   Since C(L) is a C-vector space, U ⊗ C(L) is the direct sum of free U-modules.
Hence, U ⊗ C(L) is a free resolution of the 1-dimensional trivial left U-module C. 

    Let V be a right U-module. The homology module Hk (L, V ) is defined to be

(3.7)                                Hk (L, V ) = TorUk (V, C) = Hk (V ⊗U M),

where M = (Mk , ∂k ) is the free resolution of the 1-dimensional trivial left U-module C
given by Proposition 3.1. Since we have

                         V ⊗U M ∼
                                = V ⊗U U ⊗C Ck (L) ∼
                                                   = V ⊗C Ck (L) (k ≥ 0),

and
                                                        V ⊗U C ∼
                                                               = V,
as C-vector spaces, we obtain the following standard complex for the homology of Lie
superalgebras:

(3.8)
                              dk               dk−1      d1

where the differentials dk = 1V ⊗U ∂k : V ⊗C Ck (L) −→ V ⊗C Ck−1 (L) are given by

(3.9)
     dk (v ⊗ (x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq ))
           X
      =         (−1)s+t v ⊗ ([xs , xt ] ∧ x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xbs ∧ · · · ∧ xbt ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · yq )

             X
        −              v ⊗ ([ys , yt ] ∧ x1 ∧ · · · ∧ xp ) ⊗ (y1 · · · ybs · · · ybt · · · yq )

                       t=1

for v ∈ V , xi ∈ L0 , yj ∈ L1 . In particular, when V = C is the trivial 1-dimensional
right U-module, the standard complex (3.8) is reduced to the complex (2.8) given in
Section 2.
    As a corollary of Proposition 3.1, we obtain:


                                                               15
Corollary 3.2 Let A be a countable abelian group with a coloring map θ and V =
⊕a∈A Va be a θ-colored superspace. Let L be the free Lie superalgebra generated by V .
Then we have
                                       (
                                        V     if k = 1,

                                        0     if k ≥ 2.

Proof. Note that the universal enveloping algebra of L is isomorphic to the tensor alge-
bra T (V ) generated by V . Consider the following free resolution of the 1-dimensional
trivial left T (V )-module C:
                                ϕ         ψ
                0 → T (V ) ⊗ V → T (V ) → C ≃ T (V )/T (V ) ⊗ V → 0,

where ϕ is the natural inclusion map(=multiplication map) and ψ is the augmentation
map.
    By tensoring with trivial right T (V )-module C, we get
                                       1⊗ϕ                    1⊗ψ
              0 → C ⊗T (V ) T (V ) ⊗ V → C ⊗T (V ) T (V ) → C ⊗ C → 0.

    Since 1 ⊗ ϕ is a zero map, H1 (L) = Ker (1 ⊗ ϕ) = C ⊗T (V ) T (V ) ⊗ V ≃ V , and
Hk (L) = 0 for k ≥ 2.                                                              




4     Free Lie Algebras and Free Lie Superalgebras
Let A be a countable abelian group with a coloring map θ and Γ be a countable
abelian semigroup satisfying the finiteness condition given in Section 2. Let V =
L
  (α,a)∈Γ×A V(α,a) be a (Γ × A)-gradedL θ-colored superspace with finite dimensional
homogeneous subspaces, and let L =       (α,a)∈Γ×A L(α,a) be the free Lie superalgebra
generated by V . Suppose that a group G acts on V preserving the (Γ × A)-gradation.
Then the action of G on V can be extended to L by Lie superalgebra automorphisms.
    As we have seen in Section 3, we have H1 (L) = V and Hk (L) = 0 for k ≥ 2. Hence,
for any g ∈ G, the generalized denominator identity for the free Lie superalgebra L is
equal to
                                   ∞
                                                                  !

                                                  (α,a)∈Γ×A

For any g ∈ G, let P (V, Γ × A) = {(α, a) ∈ Γ × A | str(g|V(α,a) ) 6= 0} and let
{(αi , aj ) | i, j = 1, 2, 3, · · · } be an enumeration of the set P (V, Γ × A). For each

                                             16
(τ, b) ∈ Γ × A, we denote by T (τ, b) the set of all paritions of (τ, b) into a sum of
(αi , aj )’s as defined in (2.15), and let Wg (τ, b) be the Witt partition function as defined
in (2.16). Then our supertrace formula (2.17) yields
                                X           1      X (|s| − 1)! Y
(4.2)     str(g|L(α,a) ) =                    µ(d)                  str(g d |V(αi ,aj ) )sij .

                                            d             s!    i,j
                                                   s∈T (τ,b)
                             (α,a)=d(τ,b)


Remark. The supertrace formula (4.2) is a generalization of the superdimension for-
mula for the free Lie superalgebras given in [39] and [40].


Example 4.1 In this example, we will consider the simplest application of our super-
trace formula to free Lie superalgebras. Consider the superspace V = V0 ⊕ V1 with
dim V0 = r and dim V1 = s for some r, s ∈ Z>0 , and let L be the free Lie superal-
gebra generated by V . By setting degv = 1 for all v ∈ V , the free Lie superalgebra
                               L∞                                                          ∼
L has a Z>0 -gradation L =        n=1 Ln induced by V . Let G = GL(V0 ) × GL(V1 ) =
GL(r) × GL(s). For (g, h) ∈ G, we denote by tg = tr(g|V0) and th = tr(h|V1 ). Since
P (V, Z>0 ) = {1} and str((g, h)|V ) = tr(g|V0) − tr(h|V1 ) = tg − th for all (g, h) ∈ G, the
Witt partition function W(g,h) (n) is given by

                                        (n − 1)!              1
                      W(g,h) (n) =               (tg − th )n = (tg − th )n .
                                           n!                 n
Hence, by the supertrace formula (4.2), we have
                                               1X                n

    Next, we will discuss the relation of the free Lie algebra and the free Lie superalgebra
                                               L
generated by the same vector space V =             (α,a)∈Γ×A V(α,a) on which a group G acts
preserving the (Γ × A)-gradation. By neglecting the coloring map θ on A, consider V
as a (Γ × A)-graded vector space, and let L = ⊕(α,a)∈Γ×A L(α,a) be the free Lie algebra
generated by V . Then the action of G on V can be extended to L by Lie algebra
automorphisms. Hence, for any g ∈ G, the generalized ednominator identity for L is
equal to

   Since E (α,a) = ψ(a)e(α,a) and str(g|V(α,a) ) = ψ(a)tr(g|V(α,a) ) for all (α, a) ∈ Γ × A,
the right-hand sides of (4.1) and (4.4) are the same. Moreover, note that, for an n × n

Then L = L0 ⊕ L1 and L becomes a Z2 -graded Lie superalgebra called the general
linear Lie superalgebra with the superbracket defined by

(5.3)        [X, Y ] = XY − (−1)αβ Y X              for X ∈ Lα , Y ∈ Lβ , α, β ∈ Z2 .

   A Z2 -graded superspace V = V0 ⊕ V1 is an L-module if there is a Z2 -graded Lie
superalgebra homomorphism

(5.4)          φ : L −→ gl(V ) ∼
                               = gl(k ′ , l′ ), where k ′ = dim V0 , l′ = dim V1 .

For L-modules V 1 , · · · , V n , the tensor product V 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ V n becomes an L-module
with the action of L defined by
                                     n

for x ∈ L, vi ∈ V i .
     We recall some of the basic theory of symmetric functions. A partition is any
(finite or infinite) sequence λ = (λ1 , λ2 , · · · ) of non-negative integers in decreasing
orders λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · and containing only finitely many non-zero terms. The non-zero
λi ’s are called the parts of λ. The number of parts is the length of λ, denoted by l(λ),
and the sum of parts is the weight of λ, denoted by |λ|. If |λ| = n, then we say that
λ is a partition of n, denote by λ ⊢ n. We also use the notation which indicates the
number of times each integer occurs as a part. That is, λ = (1m1 , 2m2 , · · · ) means that
i appears as a part of λ exactly mi times. Each partition λ uniquely determines a
Young diagram. The conjugate of a partition λ is the partition λ′ whose diagram is the
transpose of that of λ (i.e., the diagram obtained by reflection in the main diagonal).
There is a partial ordering on the set of parititions of n, called the natural (partial)
ordering or the dominance relation, which is defined as follows:
                                                  k
                                                  X               k
                                                                  X
                    λ ≥ µ if and only if                 λi ≥              µi for all k ≥ 1.
                                                  i=1              i=1


    Let x1 , · · · , xk be the indeterminates and λ a partition of n with l(λ) ≤ k. A Schur
function corresponding to λ is a symmetric function in x1 , · · · , xk defined by

For a partition µ = (µ1 , µ2, · · · ), we define

functions { Sλ (x) | l(λ) ≤ k } (resp. { pλ (x)| l(λ) ≤ k}) forms a Z-basis (resp. Q-basis)
of the ring of symmetric functions in x1 , · · · , xk , and { Sλ(x) | l(λ) ≤ k, λ ⊢ n } (resp.
{ pλ (x)| l(λ) ≤ k, λ ⊢ n}) forms a Z-basis (resp. Q-basis) of the subspace of symmetric
functions in x1 , · · · , xk with homogeneous degree n. The functions Sλ (x) and pλ (x) are
related as follows:

Lemma 5.1 ([46]) For each partition ρ of n, we have

                                              λ⊢n

where χρλ is the character value of the irreducible representation of Sn corresponding to
λ at the conjugacy class of type ρ.                                                    

    A partition λ is called a (k, l)-hook partition if λk+1 ≤ l. Set H(k, l; n) = { λ ⊢
n | λk+1 ≤ l }. For convenience, we will often write H for H(k, l; n). For λ ∈ H(k, l; n),
a (k, l)-hook Schur function in x1 , · · · , xk , y1 , · · · , yl corresponding to λ is a function
defined by
                                                                      X

where Sλ′ /µ′ (y) is the skew Schur function corresponding to λ′ , µ′ (cf. [8], [46], [52]).
Equivalently,
                                                                 !

where Nµλ′ ν is the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient corresponding to λ′ , µ′ , ν. The com-
binatorial interpretation of the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients is given as follows:
                                                                                     λ
for given partitions λ, µ, ν satisfying |λ| = |µ| + |ν| and λi ≥ µi for all i, Nµν     is the
number of ways the Young diagram for µ can be expanded to the Young diagram for λ
                                                                     λ
by a strict ν-expansion (if the above conditions do not hold, Nµν      = 0). For a partition
ν = (ν1 , · · · , νk ), a ν-expansion of a Young diagram for µ is obtained by first adding ν1
boxes to the Young diagram for µ with no two boxes in the same column and putting
the integer 1 in each of these ν1 boxes; then adding similarly ν2 boxes with a 2, contin-
uing until finally νk boxes are added with the integer k. The expansion is called strict
if, when the integers in the boxes are listed from right to left, starting with the top row
and working down, and one looks at the first t entries in this list (for any t between 1
and |ν|), each integer p between 1 and k − 1 occurs at least as many times as the next
integer p + 1.
   In [8], Berele and Regev showed that, for a Z2 -graded superspace V = V0 ⊕ V1
viewed as a gl(k, l)-module (k = dim V0 , l = dim V1 ), V ⊗n is completely reducible

                                               21
as a gl(k, l)-module and its irreducible components are parametrized by (k, l)-hook
partitions λ, denoted by Vλ .
    Let L(V ) be the free Lie superalgebra generated by V . Set L(V )(n,0) = L(V ) ∩
(V )0 , L(V )(n,1) = L(V ) ∩ (V ⊗n )1 and Ln (V ) = L(V )(n,0) ⊕ L(V )(n,1) . Thus L(V ) has
  ⊗n
                                  L
an (N × Z2 )-gradation: L(V ) = N×Z2 L(V )(n,α) . The homogeneous subspace Ln (V )
is a gl(k, l)-submodule of V ⊗n , where the action of x ∈ gl(k, l) induced from V ⊗n is
given by

                x · [v1 , [v2 , [· · · [vn−1 , vn ] · · · ]]]
                    X n
                                         P
                 =       (−1)deg x( j<i deg vj ) [v1 , [· · · [xvi [· · · [vn−1 , vn ] · · · ]]]],
                     i=1

and it is completely reducible with its irreducible components parametrized by λ′ s ∈ H.
    ¿From now on, we simply write Ln , L(n,0) and L(n,1) for Ln (V ), L(V )(n,0) and
L(V )(n,1) , respectively. For each λ ∈ H(k, l; n), let cλ be the multiplicity of Vλ in
Ln . To compute cλ , we would like to apply our supertrace formula. By exponentiating
the action of the Lie algebra gl(k, l)0 = gl(k) × gl(l) on V , the group GL(k) × GL(l)
acts on V , and hence V ⊗n and Ln (V ) become GL(k) × GL(l)-modules. We first recall:

Proposition 5.2 ([8]) Let λ ∈ H(k, l; n) and Vλ be the corresponding irreducible
representation of gl(k, l). Suppose that g = (g0 , g1) ∈ GL(k) × GL(l) has eigenvalues
x1 , · · · , xk for g0 and y1 , · · · , yl for g1 . Then we have

(5.10)                                  tr(g|Vλ) = HSλ(x, y).

                                                                                                            

   Our supertrace formula (4.2) for free Lie superalgebras yields

(5.11)

that cλ is the multiplicity of Vλ in Ln . By Proposition 5.2, we have

   Since { Sλ (x)Sµ (y) | l(λ) ≤ k, l(µ) ≤ l } is linearly independent ([8]), we obtain

which completes the proof.                                                                                   

    If l(λ) ≤ k (or |λ0 | = n) for λ ∈ H(k, l; n), then (5.14) yields

If all cλ ’s are known for m ≤ |λ0 | ≤ n, then for any λ ∈ H(k, l; n) with |λ0 | = m − 1,
we have

since µ0 > λ0 and |µ0 | = m − 1 imply µ0 = λ0 , and in this case, Nλµ′ λ1 = 0 unless λ = µ

(cf. [46]). Following the above inductive step, we can completely determine the value
of all cλ for λ ∈ H(k, l; n):

Proposition 5.4 Under the above hypothesis, we have

Remark. Note that the multiplicity cλ is given explicitly in closed form when l(λ) ≤ k
and is given by a recursive formula otherwise.

6     Generalized Kac-Moody Superalgebras
The generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras arise naturally in the context of Monstrous
Moonshine ([5], [6]), automorphic forms with infinite product expansions ([7], [18]–
[20]), and the string theory ([22]). In this section, we give a conjectural formula for the
homology modules over (the negative part of) generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras,
and derive a closed form supertrace formula for generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras
with group actions.
     Let I be a countable (possibly infinite) index set. A real square matrix A = (aij )i,j∈I
is called a Borcherds-Cartan matrix if it satisfies: (i) aii = 2 or aii ≤ 0 for all i ∈ I,
(ii) aij ≤ 0 if i 6= j, and aij ∈ Z if aii = 2, (iii) aij = 0 implies aji = 0. We say that an
index i is real if aii = 2 and imaginary if aii ≤ 0. We denote by I re = {i ∈ I| aii = 2},
I im = {i ∈ I| aii ≤ 0}. Let m = (mi ∈ Z>0 | i ∈ I) be a sequence of positive integers
such that mi = 1 for all i ∈ I re . We call m the charge of A. In this paper, we assume
that the Borcherds-Cartan matrix A is symmetrizable, i.e., there is a diagonal matrix
D = diag(si | i ∈ I) with si > 0 (i ∈ I) such that DA is symmetric.
    Let C = (θij )i,j∈I be a complex matrix satisfying θij θji = 1 for all i, j ∈ I. Thus
we have θii = ±1 for all i ∈ I. We call i ∈ I an even index if θii = 1 and an odd index
if θii = −1. We denote by I even (resp. I odd ) the set of all even (resp. odd) indices.
We say that a Borcherds-Cartan matrix A = (aij )i,j∈I is colored by C if aii = 2 and
θii = −1 imply aij are even integers for all j ∈ I. In this case, the matrix C is called a
coloring matrix of A.

The free abelian group Q = i∈I Zαi generated by αi ’s (i ∈ I) is called the root lattice
associated with A. Let Π = {αi | i ∈ I} and B be a basis of h∗ extending Π. Set
B ′ = B \ Π. Since A is assumed to be symmetrizable, there is a symmetric bilinear

ordering ≥ on Q given by λ ≥ µ if and only if λ − µ ∈ Q+ . The coloring matrix
C = (θij )i,j∈I defines a bimultiplicative map θ : Q × Q → C× on Q by

(6.4)                          θ(α, β)θ(β, α) = 1 for all α, β ∈ Q.
That is, θ is a coloring map on Q. In particular, θ(α, α) = ±1 for all α ∈ Q. We say
α ∈ Q is even if ψ(α) = θ(α, α) = 1 and odd if ψ(α) = θ(α, α) = −1.

The subgroup W of GL(h∗ ) generated by the ri ’s (i ∈ I re ) is called the Weyl group of
the generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra g.
   The generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra g = g(A, m, C) has the root space decom-
            L
position g = α∈Q gα , where
                        gα = {x ∈ g| [h, x] = α(h)x for all h ∈ h}.
Note that gαi = Cei,1 ⊕· · ·⊕Cei,mi and g−αi = Cfi,1 ⊕· · ·⊕Cfi,mi . We say that α ∈ Q×
is a root of g if gα 6= 0. The subspace gα is called the root space of g attached to α. A
root α is called real if (α|α) > 0 and imaginary if (α|α) ≤ 0. In particular, a simple
root αi is real if aii = 2 (i.e., i ∈ I re ) and imaginary if aii ≤ 0 (i.e., i ∈ I im ). Note that
the imaginary simple roots may have multiplicity > 1. A root α > 0 (resp. α < 0) is
called positive (resp. negative). One can show that all the roots are either positive or
negative. We denote by Φ, Φ+ , and Φ− the set of all roots, positive roots, and negative
roots, respectively. We also denote by Φ0 (resp. Φ1 ) the set of all even (resp. odd)
roots of g. Hence, for example, Φ+          will denote the set of all positive even roots of g.

for all h ∈ h, i, j ∈ I (cf. [31]). The symmetric bilinear form ( | ) on h defined by (6.6)
can be extended to a nondegenerate, supersymmetric, and invariant bilinear form on
the generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra g:
Proposition 6.1 (cf. [24], [30]) Let g = g(A, m, C) be the generalized Kac-Moody
superalgebra associated with a Borcherds-Cartan data (A, m, C). Then there exists a
nondegenerate bilinear form ( | ) on g satisfying the following conditions :
   (a) The bilinear form ( | ) is supersymmetric, i.e., we have
                          (x|y) = θ(β, α)(y|x) for x ∈ gα , y ∈ gβ .
   (b) The bilinear form ( | ) is invariant, .i.e., we have
                            ([x, y]|z) = (x|[y, z]) for x, y, z ∈ g.
   (c) The bilinear form ( | )|h is given by (6.6).
   (d) (gα |gβ ) = 0 if α + β 6= 0.
    (e) The root spaces gα and g−α are nondegenerately paired with respect to ( | ), i.e.,
the bilinear form ( | )|gα+g−α is nondegenerate.
   (f) If φ : Q → h is a linear map satisfying φ(αi ) = si hi for all i ∈ I, then we have
                 [x, y] = θ(α, α)(x|y)φ(α) for x ∈ gα , y ∈ g−α .             

   A g-module V is called h-diagonalizable if it admits a weight space decomposition
    L
V = µ∈h∗ Vµ , where
                        Vµ = {v ∈ V | h · v = µ(h)v for all h ∈ h}.
If Vµ 6= 0, then µ is called a weight of V and Vµ is called the µ-weight space. We denote
by P (V ) the set of all weights of V . When all the weight spaces are finite dimensional,
we define the character of V to be
                                          X
(6.7)                              chV =      (dimVµ ) eµ ,
                                           µ∈h∗

where eµ are the basis elements of the group algebra C[h∗ ] with the multiplication
given by eµ eν = eµ+ν for µ, ν ∈ h∗ .
    We denote by O the category of h-diagonalizable g-modules with finite dimensional
weight spaces such that there exist a finite number of linear functionals λ1 , · · · , λs
satisfying P (V ) ⊂ ∪si=1 D(λi ), where D(λ) = {µ ∈ h∗ | µ ≤ λ}. The morphisms in O
are the usual g-module homomorphisms.
    The most important example of the g-modules in category O may be the class of
highest weight modules. An h-diagonalizable g-module V is called a highest weight
module with highest weight λ ∈ h∗ if there is a nonzero vector vλ ∈ V such that (i)
eik · vλ = 0 for all i ∈ I, k = 1, · · · , mi , (ii) h · vλ = λ(h)vλ for all h ∈ h, (iii)
V = U(g) · vλ . The vector vλ is called a highest weight vector. For a highest weight
                                                                                L
module V with highest weight λ, we have (i) V = U(g− ) · vλ , (ii) V =            µ≤λ Vµ ,
Vλ = Cvλ , and (iii) dimVµ < ∞ for all µ ≤ λ.
     Let b+ = h ⊕ g+ , and let Cλ be the 1-dimensional b+ -module defined by h · 1 =
λ(h)1 for all h ∈ h and g+ · 1 = 0. The induced module M(λ) = U(g) ⊗U (b+ ) Cλ is
called the Verma module over g with highest weight λ. Every highest weight g-module
with highest weight λ is a homomorphic image of M(λ) and the Verma module M(λ)
contains a unique maximal submodule J(λ). Hence the quotient V (λ) = M(λ)/J(λ)
is irreducible.
    Let V be a g-module in category O. We define the Casimir operator on V as follows
(cf. [24], [30]). Take a linear functional ρ ∈ h∗ satisfying ρ(hi ) = 12 aii for all i ∈ I. Such
a linear functional is called a Weyl vector of g. Note that (ρ|αi ) = ρ(si hi ) = 12 (αi |αi )
                                                               (i)
(i ∈ I). For each positive root α ∈ Φ+ , choose a basis {eα | i = 1, · · · , dimgα } of the
                            (i)
root space gα and let {e−α | i = 1, · · · , dimgα } be the dual basis of g−α in the sense
        (i) (j)
that (eα |e−α ) = δij θ(α, α). Then for a weight vector v ∈ Vλ of weight λ, the Casimir
operator Ω on V is defined by
                                                   X dimg
                                                      Xα       (i)
(6.8)                  Ω(v) = (λ + 2ρ|λ)vλ + 2                e−α e(i)
                                                                   α vλ .
                                                   α∈Φ+ i=1

The Casimir operator commutes with the action of g on V . Recall that a weight vector
v ∈ V is called a primitive vector if there is a g-submodule W of V such that v ∈
                                                                                /W

and eik · v ∈ W for all i ∈ I, k = 1, 2, · · · , mi (cf. [31]). The Casimir operator satisfies
the following properties:

Proposition 6.2 (a) If V is a highest weight g-module in Category O with highest
weight Λ, then we have

(6.9)                                      Ω = (Λ + 2ρ|Λ)IV .

    (b) If v is a primitive vector with weight λ, then there exists a g-submodule W ⊂ V
such that v ∈
            / W and

(6.10)                         Ω(v) = (λ + 2ρ|λ)v mod W.                      

j ∈ J, and let W (J) = {w ∈ W | Φw ⊂ Φ+ (J)}, where Φw = {α ∈ Φ+ | w −1 α < 0}.
                                                                 (J)
Thus WJ is the Weyl group of the Kac-Moody superalgebra g0 and W (J) is the set
of right coset representatives of WJ in W . That is, W = WJ W (J). Let us denote by
Φ±            ±                 ±         ±   ±
  J,i = ΦJ ∩ Φi (i = 0, 1) and Φi (J) = Φi \ ΦJ,i (i = 0, 1). Then we have the following
                                     (J)
conjecture for the structure of Hk (g− ):

Remark. The formula (6.18) was first introduced by Kostant for finite dimensional
simple Lie algebras ([43]). It was generalized to symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras

                                                   31
([17], [44]) and generalized Kac-Moody algebras ([49]). But, in general, it is not true
for Lie superalgebras. Still, we conjecture that Kostant’s formula holds for general-
ized Kac-Moody superalgebras associated with the Borcherds-Cartan matrix which is
colored by a coloring matrix.

    We would like to remind the readers that our supertrace formula (6.23) has been
derived under the assumption that Kostant’s formula holds for generalized Kac-Moody
superalgebras. However, in some special cases, we can derive the supertrace formula
for generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras wihtout assuming Kostant’s formula.

I is finite, (ii) aij 6= 0 for all i, j ∈ I im . Then it is known that the Lie su-

     Now, we will consider the generalized Kac-Moody superalgebras associated with
the normalized q-series. We take I = {−1} ∪ {1, 2, 3, · · · } to be the index set, and
let A = (−(i + j))i,j∈I be the Borcherds-Cartan matrix of the Monster Lie algebra
                                                  P∞            n
([6]). Consider a normalized q-series F (q) =       n=−1 f (n)q such that f (−1) = 1,
f (0) = 0, and f (n) ∈ Z for all n ≥ 1. We define the charge of the matrix A to be
m = (|f (i)| : i ∈ I), and choose a coloring matrix C = (θij )i,j∈I such that θii = 1 if
f (i) > 0 and θii = −1 if f (i) < 0. That is, an index i ∈ I is even if f (i) > 0 and odd
if f (i) < 0.
    The generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra L(F ) = g(A, m, C) associated with the
above data is called the Monstrous Lie superalgebra associated with the normalized
                    P∞           n
q-series F (q) =      n=−1 f (n)q . For example, the Monstrous Lie superalgebra as-
sociated with the elliptic modular function J(q) = j(q) − 744 is the Monster Lie
algebra, and the Monstrous Lie superalgebras associated with the Thompson series
         P
Tg (q) = ∞              n
            n=−1 cg (n)q are the Monstrous Lie superalgebras given in [6].

    Let L(F ) be the Monstrous Lie superalgebra associated with a normalized q-series
          P
F (q) = ∞                n
             n=−1 f (n)q . By our choice of the charge and the coloring matrix, we see
that α−1 is the only real even simple root, αi (i ≥ 1) is an imaginary even simple root
with multiplicity f (i) if f (i) > 0, and an imaginary odd simple root with multiplicity
−f (i) if f (i) < 0. If we identify the simple roots α−1 with (1, −1) ∈ II1,1 and αi with
(1, i) ∈ II1,1 (i ≥ 1), then the Monstrous Lie superalgebra L(F ) becomes a II1,1 -graded
Lie superalgebra, and we have
                              M                          M

Then V = n=−1 Vn is a Z-graded representation of the group G such that sch(V ) =
        P                                      P∞

          n=−1 f (n)q and schg (V ) = Fg (q) =

                                                  n=−1 fg (n)q .

    Consider a basis of Vi consisting of the eigenvectors vi,k of g ∈ G with eigenvalues
λi,k (k = 1, · · · , |f (i)|). Then we have
                                                                     |f (i)|
                                                                     X
                              fg (i) = str(g|Vi ) = ψ(1, i)                    λi,k .
                                                                     k=1

To apply our supertrace formula (6.23), take J = {−1} and consider the corresponding
triangular decomposition
                                               (J)             (J)                (J)
                            L(F ) = L(F )− ⊕ L(F )0 ⊕ L(F )+ .

Then L(F )0 = he−1 , f−1 , h−1 i + h ∼
             (J)                                                                          (J)
                                            = sl(2, C) + h, and the subalgebra L(F )− (resp.
      (J)
L(F )+ ) is isomorphic to the free Lie superalgebra generated by the superspace H (J) =
L∞                 ⊕|f (i)|          (J)∗
                                            L∞ ∗           ⊕|f (i)|
   i=1 V J (−α i )          (resp. H      =  i=1 VJ (−αi )          ), where VJ (−αi ) and VJ∗ (−αi )
are the i-dimensional irreducible representations of sl(2, C) (since −αi (h−1 ) = i − 1).
                                                           (J)
We will concentrate on the Lie superalgebra L(F )− .
  Since the weights of VJ (−αi ) are −αi = (−1, −i), −αi − α−1 = (−2, −i + 1), · · · ,
−αi − (i − 1)α−1 = (−i, −1), we have

                               P (H (J) ) = {(−i, −j)| i, j ∈ Z>0 }.

Note that each fi,k generates an i-dimensional irreducible representation of the Lie
algebra sl(2, C) generated by e−1 , f−1 , h−1 , and hence so does each vi,k (i ≥ 1, k =
1, 2, · · · , |f (i)|). Thus we have
                                          |f (i+j−1)|
                            (J)
                                             M
                           H(−i,−j)   =                 C(adf−1 )i−1 (fi+j−1,k )
                                             k=1
                                          |f (i+j−1)|
                                             M
                                      =                 C(adf−1 )i−1 (vi+j−1,k ).
                                             k=1

It follows that
                    g · (adf−1 )i−1 (vi+j−1,k ) = (ad(g · f−1 ))i−1 (g · vi+j−1,k )
                                                   = λi+j−1,k (adf−1 )i−1 (vi+j−1,k ),

                                                        35
which yields
                                                        |f (i+j−1)|

for all g ∈ G, i, j ∈ Z>0 . Hence the generalized denominator identity for g ∈ G of the

the Witt partition function Wg (k, l) is given by
                                         X (|s| − 1)! Y        (J)
                     Wg(J) (k, l) =                     str(g|H(−i,−j))sij

Therefore, our supertrace formula (6.23) yields:

Then, for all g ∈ G and m, n > 0, we have

8       Orbit Lie Superalgebras for the Dynkin Diagram
        Automorphisms of Borcherds-Cartan Data
In the following two sections, we will discuss the applications of the generalized de-
nominator identities for Dynkin diagram automorphisms of generalized Kac-Moody
superalgebras. The notion of orbit Lie superalgebras will play an important role in
our discussion. Most of our result is a generalization of the corresonding result on
Kac-Moody algebras and generalized Kac-Moody algebras obtained in [13] and [14].
Let A = (aij )i,j∈I be a Borcherds-Cartan matrix of charge m = (mi | i ∈ I) with a
coloring matrix C = (θij )i,j∈I , and let g = g(A, m, C) be the corresponding generalized
Kac-Moody superalgebra.


Definition 8.1 A bijection σ : I → I is called a Dynkin diagram automorphism of the
Borcherds-Cartan data (A, m, C) if it satisfies: (i) aij = aσ(i),σ(j) for all i, j ∈ I, (ii)
σ(I even ) ⊂ I even , σ(I odd ) ⊂ I odd , (iii) mσ(i) = mi for all i ∈ I.

In this paper, we will assume that the Dynkin diagram automorphism has finite order
N.
   Given a Dynkin diagram automorphism σ of a Borcherds-Cartan data (A, m, C),
we extend it to a Lie superalgebra automorphism of g = g(A, m, C) by defining

                         σ(eik ) = eσ(i),k for i ∈ I, 1 ≤ k ≤ mi ,
(8.1)                    σ(fik ) = fσ(i),k for i ∈ I, 1 ≤ k ≤ mi ,
                         σ(hi ) = hσ(i) , σ(di ) = dσ(i) for i ∈ I.

It is straightforward to check that σ is indeed a Lie superalgebra automorphism of g.
Let U = U(g) be the universal enveloping algebra of g. Then the Dynkin diagram
automorphism σ of g can be extended to an algebra automorphism of U(g) by

                       σ(x1 · · · xk ) = σ(x1 ) · · · σ(xk ) for xi ∈ g,

which we will also denote by σ.
    Moreover, the Dynkin diagram automorphism σ induces an automorphism σ ∗ of h∗
defined by

(8.2)                   σ ∗ (λ)(h) = λ(σ −1 (h)) for λ ∈ h∗ , h ∈ h.

In particular, for all i ∈ I, we have σ ∗ (αi ) = ασ(i) . Since σ has order N, σ ∗ also has
order N, and we have an eigenspace decomposition
                                            N
                                            M −1
                                       ∗
                                      h =         (h∗ )(k) ,
                                            k=0

where (h∗ )(k) = {λ ∈ h∗ | σ ∗ (λ) = e            N     λ}. The elements of (h∗ )(0) = {λ ∈ h∗ | σ ∗ (λ) =
λ} are called symmetric.
     Now, we will construct a generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra ğ = g(σ), called the
orbit Lie superalgebra, associated with the Dynkin diagram automorphism σ of g. Let
σ be a Dynkin diagram automorphism of the Borcherds-Cartan data (A, m, C). Since σ
                                                                                           F

where [i] = {σ k (i)| k = 0, 1, · · · , Ni − 1}. Let Ni = |[i]| denote the number of elements
in the σ-orbit [i]. For each i ∈ I, let ī be the smallest element of the σ-orbit of i, and
let Ib = {ī| i ∈ I} be the set of such representatives. Set Ibre = Ib ∩ I re , Ibim = Ib ∩ I im ,
Ibeven = Ib ∩ I even , and Ibodd = Ib ∩ I odd .
        b = A(σ)

where ǫj = 1 −         k=1   aj,σk (j) . Note that ǫj = ǫσ(j) for all j ∈ I.
     Let

(8.4)                 I˘ = { i ∈ Ib | ǫi ≤ 2 for i ∈ I re , ǫi = 1 for i ∈ I im }.

Since baī,ī = ǫi (aii + 1 − ǫi ), the condition on I˘ is equivalent to b                                  b
                                                                                  aī,ī = aii for all ī ∈ I.
(The first half of the condition (8.4) was introduced in [13] and was referred to as the
linking condition.) Also, we set Ă = Ă(σ) = (b       aī,j̄ )ī,j̄∈I˘, I˘re = I˘ ∩ I re , I˘im = I˘ ∩ I im ,
I˘even = I˘ ∩ I even , and I˘odd = I˘ ∩ I odd .
     One can easily verify that A       b is a symmetrizable Borcherds-Cartan matrix. For

denote by Π̆ = {b αī | ī ∈ I}b the set of simple roots of ğ and by Φ̆ the set of roots of ğ.

            b sī hbī ) for λ

which proves our claim.                                                                                    

   Observe that if ǫi = 1, the σ-orbit of i in the Dynkin diagram of g is the disjoint
union of Ni copies of A1 diagram or B(0, 1) diagram. If ǫi = 2, then Ni is even and
the σ-orbit of i in the Dynkin diagram of g is the disjoint union of Ni /2 copies of A2
diagram.
    Next, we will show that the Weyl group W̆ of ğ is isomorphic to a subgroup of W .
We may assume that W̆ acts on b      h∗ since ğ is a subalgebra of b      g. For each ī ∈ I˘re , we

Proposition 8.4 The Weyl group W̆ of the orbit Lie superalgebra ğ is isomorphic to
the subgroup W̄ of W under the map w̆ī 7→ w̄ī (ī ∈ I˘re ).
Proof. See [13] or [14].                                                         

    Remark. The original proof of 8.4 in [13] consists of a somewhat lengthy calcu-
lations. In [14], the proof was simplified and it was also proved that W̄ ∼
                                                                          = {w ∈
        ∗   ∗
W | wσ = σ w }.
  Under the above identification of W̄ with W̆ , we define the sign function ε̄ : W̄ →
{±1} of W̄ by
                   ε̄(w̄) = ε(φw̄φ−1 ) = ε(ψ −1 (w̄)) for w̄ ∈ W̄ ,
where ε denotes the sign function of the Weyl group W̆ of the orbit Lie superalgebra
ğ = g(σ). Note that, even though W̄ is a subgroup of W , we use the sign function of
W̆ , not the sign function of W .

9       Generalized Characters of Highest Weight Mod-
        ules for Dynkin Diagram Automorphisms
Let Λ ∈ P + be a dominant integral weight and let M(Λ) be the Verma module with
highest weight Λ. By construction of M(Λ), we have
                                            
                                M(Λ) ∼= U(g) R(Λ),

where R(Λ) is the left ideal of U(g) generated by the elements eik (i ∈ I, k = 1, · · · , mi )
and h − Λ(h)1 (h ∈ h). By (8.1) and (8.2), we see that σ(R(Λ)) = R(σ ∗ (Λ)). Hence
the Dynkin diagram automorphism σ induces a C-linear isomorphism

(9.1)                                 σ : M(Λ) → M(σ ∗ (Λ))

between Verma modules. Note that we have σ(M(Λ)λ ) = M(σ ∗ (Λ))σ∗ (λ) for all λ ≤ Λ.
   Similarly, let V (Λ) be the irreducible highest weight module with highest weight
Λ. Then by Corollary 6.4, the Dynkin diagram automorphism induces a C-linear
isomorphism

(9.2)                                 σ : V (Λ) → V (σ ∗ (Λ))

between irreducible highest weight modules, and we have σ(V (Λ)λ ) = V (σ ∗ (Λ))σ∗ (λ)
for all λ ≤ Λ.
   In particular, if Λ ∈ (h∗ )(0) , i.e., if σ ∗ (Λ) = Λ, then the Dynkin diagram automor-
phism σ induces C-linear automorphisms on M(Λ) and V (Λ), and we can consider the
generalized characters for σ:
                                              X
                             chσ M(Λ) =            tr(σ|M(Λ)λ )eλ ,
                                             λ≤Λ
(9.3)                                        X
                               chσ V (Λ) =         tr(σ|V (Λ)λ )eλ .
                                             λ≤Λ

Note that we have only to take the sum over the weights λ such that σ ∗ (λ) = λ.
   Recall that the automorphism σ ∗ permutes the roots of g in such a way that we
have
                   σ ∗ (Φ± ) = Φ± , σ ∗ (Φ±      ±    ∗  ±      ±
                                          0 ) = Φ0 , σ (Φ1 ) = Φ1 .

Thus Φ± is a disjoint union of σ ∗ -orbits of the elements in Φ± . Let S ± denote the set
of representatives of σ ∗ -orbits in Φ± and set

                               S0± = S ± ∩ Φ0 , S1± = S ± ∩ Φ1 .

For each root α ∈ Φ, let Nα denote the number of elements in σ ∗ -orbit of α, and define
                               NX
                                α −1                          N
                                                              M α −1
                                        ∗k
(9.4)                  (α) =           σ (α) and g(α) =                gσ∗ k (α) .
                                k=0                            k=0


                                                42
Then, by the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem, we have

                                     U(g± ) ∼
                                            = S(g±        ±

                     S(g±  ∼              S(g(α) ), and Λ(g±  ∼

Proposition 9.1 For all w̄ ∈ W̄ , we have

(9.5)                        w̄ e−ρ chσ M(0) = ε̄(w̄)e−ρ chσ M(0).

Proof. It suffices to prove our assertion for the simple reflections w̄ī ∈ W̄ (ī ∈ I˘re ).
For each i ∈ I re , let ri = exp(e′i ) exp(−fi′ ) exp(e′i ), where the elements e′i , fi′ and h′i are
defined by
                (
                    e′i = ei , fi′ = fi , h′i = hi                        if i ∈ I even ,
                    e′i = 41 [ei , ei ], fi′ = 14 [fi , fi ], h′i = 12 hi if i ∈ I odd .


                                                     43
Then for each i ∈ I, the elements e′i , fi′ , and h′i generate the subalgebra of g isomorphic
to sl(2, C), and by the same argument in [30], we can verify that ri ∈ Aut(g) and
ri (gα ) = gwi (α) .
   We first consider the case when ǫi = 1. (Recall that, in this case, ai,σ(i) = 0.)
                                                          Q i −1
Suppose α 6= αi and α 6= 2αi . If we put r̄ī = N          k=0 rσk (i) , then since ai,σk (i) = 0, we
get rσk′ (i) rσk (i) = rσk (i) rσk′ (i) . It follows that

                    str(σ m |g(−α) ) = str(r̄ī σ m r̄ī−1 |g(−w̄ī α) ) = str(σ m |g(−w̄ī α) ).

If α = αi and i ∈ I even , then, since
                                                (
                                                 Ni           if m ≡ 0 (mod Ni ),
                           str(σ m |g(−αi ) ) =
                                                 0            otherwise,

we have                                                               !

                                    = −e−ρ+(αi ) (1 + e(αi ) )(1 − e(2αi ) )−1
                                    = −e−ρ (1 − E −(αi ) )(1 − E −(2αi ) )−1 .

    Next, we consider the case when ǫi = 2. In this case, we have ai,σNi /2 (i) = −1,
which implies that i ∈ I even . Suppose α 6= αk and α 6= αk + ασNi /2 (k) for any k = σ l (i)
                                      QNi /2−1
(1 ≤ l ≤ Ni /2). Set r̄ī = l=0                   rσl (i) rσl+Ni /2 (i) rσl (i) . Since ak,σNi /2 (k) = −1 implies
rk rσNi /2 (k) rk = rσNi /2 (k) rk rσNi /2 (k) (see, for example, [33]), we have σr̄ī = r̄ī σ and

                    str(σ m |g(−α) ) = str(r̄ī σ m r̄ī−1 |g(−w̄ī α) ) = str(σ m |g(−w̄ī α) ).

If α = αk or α = αk + ασNi /2 (k) for some k = σ l (i) (1 ≤ l ≤ Ni /2) (i.e. (α) = (αi )),
then

which completes the proof of our assertion.                                                             


Proposition 9.2 For Λ ∈ P + and w̄ ∈ W̄ ⊂ W , we have

(9.6)                              w̄(chσ V (Λ)) = chσ V (Λ).

Proof. It suffices to prove (9.6) for w̄ = w̄ī (ī ∈ I˘re ). Let π : g → gl(V (Λ)) denote the
representation of g on V (Λ) and define
                            (Q
                              Ni −1 π
                                    rσk (i)                         if ǫi = 1,
                     r̄īπ = Qk=0
                              Ni /2−1
                              l=0     rσl (i) rσl+Ni /2 (i) rσl (i) if ǫi = 2.

By the same argument in the preceding proposition, we have σr̄īπ = r̄īπ σ. It follows
that
                         tr(σ|V (Λ)λ ) = tr(σ|V (Λ)w̄ī λ ),
which proves our assertion.                                                                             

   Now, we are in a position to state and prove the main result of this section.

Theorem 9.3 Let σ be a Dynkin diagram automorphism of a generalized Kac-Moody
superalgebra g and let ğ = g(σ) be the corresponding orbit Lie superalgebra. Let φ :
(h∗ )(0) → b
           h∗ be the C-linear isomorphism given by (8.6), and extend it to a C-linear
map φ : C[[(h∗ )(0) ]] → C[[b
                            h∗ ]] by φ(eλ ) = eφ(λ) for λ ∈ (h∗ )(0) . Then, for a symmetric
dominant integral weight Λ ∈ P + ∩ (h∗ )(0) , we have

(9.7)                             φ(chσ V (Λ)) = chV̆ (φ(Λ)),

where V̆ (φ(Λ)) is the irreducible highest weight ğ-module with highest weight φ(Λ).


                                                  45
Proof. Using the properties of Casimir operator given in Proposition 6.2, the same
argument in [31] yields
                                       X
(9.8)                   chσ V (Λ) =           cλ chσ M(λ).
                                                     λ≤Λ
                                                |λ+ρ|2 =|Λ+ρ|2


Since chσ M(λ) = eλ chσ M(0), by (9.8), we have
                                              X
(9.9)                    eρ Rσ chσ V (Λ) =                             cλ eλ+ρ ,

where

We may assume that the sum in the right-hand side of (9.9) is taken over the weights
λ which are invariant under σ ∗ .
    If w̄(λ + ρ) = τ + ρ, then cτ = ε̄(w̄)cλ . Choose a weight τ such that cτ 6= 0. Then
w̄(τ + ρ) ≤ Λ + ρ for all w̄ ∈ W̄ . Let λ be an element of the set {w̄(τ + ρ) − ρ| w̄ ∈ W̄ }
such that ht(Λ−λ) is minimal. Note that (λ+ρ|αi ) ≥ 0 for all ī ∈ Ibre \ I˘re by definition
   ˘ If (λ + ρ|αi ) < 0 for some ī ∈ I˘re , then w̄ī (λ + ρ) = λ + ρ − ǫi (λ + ρ)(hi )(αi )
of I.
and ht(Λ − w̄ī (λ)) < ht(Λ − λ), which is a contradiction. Hence, (λ + ρ|αi ) ≥ 0 for all
i ∈ I re . Moreover, since |Λ + ρ|2 = |λ + ρ|2 , we have

(9.10)            0 = |Λ + ρ|2 − |λ + ρ|2 = (Λ|Λ − λ) + (λ + 2ρ|Λ − λ),
                 P
where Λ − λ =       i∈I   ni αi lies in Q+ .
   If i ∈ I re , then
                              (λ + 2ρ|αi ) = (λ + ρ|αi ) + (ρ|αi ) > 0.
If i ∈ I im and ni ≥ 1, then

                        (λ + 2ρ|αi ) = (λ + αi |αi )
                                 X
                         = (Λ −        nj αj − (ni − 1)αi |αi )
                                 j∈I\{i}
                                       X
                        = (Λ|αi ) −             nj (αj |αi ) − (ni − 1)(αi |αi ) ≥ 0.
                                      j∈I\{i}

                                                          P
It follows that ni = 0 for all i ∈ I re . That is, λ = Λ − i∈I im ni αi . ¿From (9.10), for
k ∈ I im with nk ≥ 1, we have
                                                         X
               (λ + 2ρ|αk ) = (λ + αk |αk ) = (Λ|αk ) −    n′i (αi |αk ) = 0,
                                                                   i∈I im


                                                      46
where n′i = ni for i 6= k and n′k = nk − 1. Hence we have

                                 (Λ|αk ) = 0,
                                 (αi |αk ) = 0 if ni ≥ 1 and i 6= k,
                                (αk |αk ) = 0 if nk ≥ 2,

and k lies in I˘im . Combining the above conditions and the fact that ni = nσ(i) for all
i ∈ I,we conclude that λ has the form
                                           X
                                  λ=Λ−         nī (αi ),
                                                   ī∈I˘im

where

                             ((αi )|(αj )) = 0 if ī 6= j̄ and nī , nj̄ ≥ 1,
                                (Λ|(αi )) = 0 if nī ≥ 1,
                             ((αi )|(αi )) = 0 if nī ≥ 2.

Let λ, λ′ be two such elements of the above form. Suppose that there exists a w̄ ∈ W̄
such that w̄(λ + ρ) = λ′ + ρ. Then, if λ ∈ P + , we have w̄(λ) ≤ λ, since w̄(λ) is also
a weight of the g-module V (λ). Furthermore, by induction on the length of w̄, we can
                                                                        P
verify w̄(ρ) ≤ ρ. Hence we obtain w̄(λ+ρ) ≤ λ+ρ and w̄(λ+ρ) = λ+ρ− α∈Φ+,re nα α
with nα ≥ 0. On the other hand, if w̄(λ + ρ) = λ′ + ρ, we must have nα = 0 for all
α ∈ Φ+,re . Hence w̄(λ + ρ) = λ + ρ, which implies λ = λ′ .
    Let Φ+ (Λ) be the set defined in (6.12) and let Φ+ (Λ)(0) = Φ+ (Λ) ∩ (h∗ )(0) be the set
              P
of elements ī∈I˘im nī (αi ) such that ((αi )|(αj )) = 0 if nī , nj̄ ≥ 1 for ī 6= j̄, (Λ|(αi )) = 0
if nī ≥ 1, and ((αi )|(αi )) = 0 if nī ≥ 2. So (9.9) can be written as follows :
                                         X           X
                     eρ Rσ chσ V (Λ) =        ǭ(w̄)         cΛ−β ew̄(Λ−β+ρ) .
                                           w̄∈W̄      β∈Φ+ (Λ)(0)

                                                             (0)
Now, it remains to determine cP    Λ−β for β ∈ SΛ . First, we observe that chσ V (Λ)
                                Λ− i∈I im ni αi
contains no term of the form e                  , where (Λ|αi ) = 0 for all i such that ni ≥ 1.
So, in order to determine cΛ−β , we have only to compute the coefficient of eΛ−β in Rσ .
Note that ((αi )|(αj )) = 0 implies that αi + αj 6∈ Φ.
    For each ī ∈ I˘im , we have
                                                                   !

Since φ((αi )) = α     bī for ī ∈ I˘im , by Lemma 8.2, we have ((αi )|(αj )) = 0 if and only if

Clearly, [g[α] , g[β] ] ⊂ g[α+β] , and hence g becomes a Q-graded  Lie superalgebra with

the coloring of Q induced by that of Q. Note that the Dynkin diagram automorphism
                       b
σ preserves the Q-gradation         of g. With respect to this gradation, the generalized
denominator identity for the Dynkin diagram automorphism σ of the generalized Kac-

Theorem 9.5 The generalized denominator identity of the Q-graded generalized Kac-

Remark. (a) For the Kac-Moody algebras and generalized Kac-Moody algebras,
Theorem 9.3 was proved in [13] and [14]. They also gave a list of Dynkin diagram

automorphisms of Kac-Moody algebras g of finite growth and corresponding orbit Lie
algebras ğ ([13]).
                                                                      b
    (b) Let Dσ (g) denote the generalized denominator identity of the Q-graded gener-
alized Kac-Moody superalgebra g for the Dynkin diagram automorphism σ and D(ğ)
the denominator identity of the orbit Lie superalgebra ğ. Then, Theorem 9.5 implies
(9.14)                                             Dσ (g) = D(ğ).

   (c) For the affine Kac-Moody superalgebras introduced in [30], we have
         Dσ (A(2) (0, 2n − 1)) = D(B (1) (0, n − 1)) when n ≥ 2 and σ has order 2,
                     Dσ (C (2) (3)) = D(A(4) (0, 2)) when σ has order 2,
         Dσ (C (2) (0, 2n + 1)) = D(A(4) (0, 2n)) when n ≥ 2 and σ has order 2,
         Dσ (C (2) (0, 2n + 2)) = D(B (1) (0, n)) when n ≥ 2 and σ has order 2.

Proof. Note that gσβ is a representation of a finite cyclic group hσi. Hence dimgσβ is the
multiplicity of the trivial representation of hσi in gσβ and it is the same as the average
of traces of τ ∈ hσi on gσβ .                                                           

Remark. By the similar argument in [5], we can see that gσ is a central extension of a
generalized Kac-Moody superalgebra. However, the corresponding Borcherds-Cartan
matrix is not known in general. Also, the decomposition of gσ with respect to the
b
Q−gradation  is coarser than its root space decomposition.
