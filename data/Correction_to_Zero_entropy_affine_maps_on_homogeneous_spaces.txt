                                                    Abstract. Proposition 6.4 of the author’s paper [American Journal of

                                                    was used in the proof of Corollary 6.5, so we provide a new proof of the
                                                    latter result.



                                               Professor A. Starkov has pointed out an error in the proof of Proposi-
                                            tion 6.4 of the author’s paper [American Journal of Mathematics 109 (1987)
                                            927–961]. Contrary to the assertion near the end of the first paragraph, it
                                            may not be possible to choose T ∗ to be a subgroup of hgi∗ . (The prob-
                                            lem is that hgi∗ may not contain a maximal torus of (Rad G)∗ , because the
                                            maximal torus of hgi∗ may be diagonally embedded in LEVI∗ × T ∗ .) The
                                            proposition cannot be salvaged, so the claim must be retracted.
                                               Fortunately, Proposition 6.4 was used only in the proof of Corollary 6.5,
                                            for which we can give a direct proof. As it is no longer a corollary, we now
                                            reclassify this as a proposition.
                                            Proposition 6.5. Suppose g is an ergodic translation on a locally faithful
                                            finite-volume homogeneous space Γ\G of a Lie group G, and assume G =
                                            ΓG◦ = G◦ hgi. If g has zero entropy, then, for some nonzero power g n of g,
                                            there is a finite-volume homogenenous space Γ′ \G′ of some Lie group G′
                                            whose radical is nilpotent, and a continuous map ψ : Γ′ \G′ → Γ\G that is
                                            affine for some translation g′ ∈ G′ via gn . Furthermore, every fiber of ψ is
                                            finite.
                                            Proof. Assume for simplicity that G is connected and simply connected. (A
                                            remark on the general case follows the proof.) Because g is ergodic, we may
                                            assume Γhgi is dense in G.
                                               Let G∗ be the identity component of the Zariski closure of Ad G in Aut(G),
                                            let S ∗ be a maximal compact torus of the Zariski closure of AdG hgi, and
                                            let L∗ T ∗ be a reductive Levi subgroup of G∗ , containing S ∗ . (So L∗ is
                                            semisimple and T ∗ is a maximal torus of Rad G∗ that centralizes L∗ . From
                                            Prop. 6.2, we know that T ∗ is compact.) The composition of AdG and the
                                            projection from G∗ onto T ∗ /(L∗ ∩ T ∗ ) is a homomorphism, which, because

G is simply connected, can be lifted to a homomorphism π : G → T ∗ . Define
a map φ : G → G ⋊ T ∗ by xφ = (x, x−π ), where x−π = (x−1 )π . Notice that

                             (xy)φ = xφ · (y x         )φ ,
                                                  −π
                                                                               (1)

for all x, y ∈ G.
   The definition of φ is based on the nilshadow construction of Auslander
and Tolimieri [AT] (or see [W, §4]). In particular, Rad Gφ is the nilshadow
of Rad G, so Rad Gφ is nilpotent.
   Let Γ\G be the faithful version of Γφ \Gφ . More precisely, let Γ = Γφ /N
and G = Gφ /N , where N is the largest normal subgroup of Gφ contained
in Γφ . We know Γπ is finite (see Prop. 4.20), so, replacing Γ by a finite-index
subgroup, we may assume Γπ = e. This implies that (γx)φ = γ φ xφ for all
γ ∈ Γ and x ∈ G, so φ induces a well-defined homeomorphism φ : Γ\G →
Γ\G.
   Unfortunately, φ is not affine for g if T ∗ does not centralize g. We will
compensate for the action of T ∗ by composing with a twisted affine map.
Assume for simplicity that L∗ ∩ T ∗ = e. (Under this assumption, the map
L∗ × T ∗ → L∗ T ∗ is an isomorphism. In general, it is a finite cover.) Let
SL∗ = (L∗ ∩ S ∗ )◦ , and let S∆
                              ∗ be a subtorus of S ∗ that is complementary
     ∗                 ∗   ∗
to SL and contains S ∩ T . Let S⊥  ∗ be the image of S ∗ under the projection
                                                        ∆
L∗ × T ∗ → L∗ , and notice that SL∗ ∩ S⊥∗ = e. Thus, we have


                 S ∗ = SL∗ × S∆
                              ∗
                                ⊂ SL∗ × S⊥
                                         ∗
                                           × T ∗ ⊂ L∗ × T ∗ .

Because Γhgi is dense in G and Γπ = e, we see that S∆       ∗ finitely covers T ∗ ,
                      ∗      ∗
via the projection S⊥ × T → T .      ∗

   Let L be a semisimple Levi subgroup of G with AdG L = L∗ , and let L be
the corresponding Levi subgroup of G. Since Rad G is nilpotent, and Γ\G
is faithful, we know that Z(G) is compact (see Cor. 4.6), so some compact
torus S ⊥ ⊂ L finitely covers S⊥  ∗ , via the map Ad .
                                                     G
   By construction, we know that T ∗ is finitely covered by S∆   ∗ , so the homo-
                       ∗                                  ∗
morphism π : G → T lifts to a homomorphism G → S∆ . By composing this
with the projection S∆   ∗ → S ∗ , we obtain a homomorphism G → S ∗ . Then,
                                ⊥                                        ⊥
since S ⊥ finitely covers S⊥∗ , this lifts to a homomorphism π : G → S . Note
                                                                           ⊥
that, from the definition of π, we have (AdG (xπ ), xπ ) ∈ S∆   ∗ , for all x ∈ G.

Because S∆  ∗ ⊂ S ∗ is contained in the identity component of the Zariski

closure of AdG hgi, which centralizes g, this implies that

                                  gx
                                       −π x−π
                                                = g.                           (2)

  Replacing Γ by a finite-index subgroup, we may assume Γπ = e; hence
π induces a well-defined map from Γ\G to S ⊥ . Thus, we may define a
homeomorphism

                        ψ : Γ\G → Γ\G : x 7→ xφ · x−π .                        (3)

Then
       (3)              (1)                         (3)                       (2)
(xg)ψ = (xg)φ ·(xg)−π = (xφ gx
                                  −π φ
                                         )(x−π g−π ) = xψ gx
                                                               −π x−π φ
                                                                          g−π = xψ g φ g−π .
In other words, ψ is affine for g via gφ g −π .

Remark. If G is not connected, then, because G = G◦ hgi, there is no harm
in assuming G = G◦ ⋊ hgi, and we may assume G◦ is simply connected.
   Let G∗ and G− be the identity components of the Zariski closures of Ad G
and Ad G◦ , respectively. By replacing g with a power g n , we may assume
Ad g ∈ G∗ . Let S + be a maximal compact torus of the Zariski closure of
AdG hgi, and let S ∗ = (S + ∩ G− )◦ . Let L∗ T + be a reductive Levi subgroup
of G∗ , containing S + , and define T ∗ = T + ∩ G− .
   Let TL T + be a maximal compact torus in G∗ , containing S + (where TL is
a compact torus in L∗ ), so TL T ∗ is a maximal compact torus in G− . Then
TL T ∗ S + = TL T + , so there is a subtorus Z of S + that is almost complemen-
tary to TL T ∗ in TL T + . Assume for simplicity that ZTL ∩ T ∗ = e, so there
is a natural projection G∗ → T ∗ . Then we may define a homomorphism
π : G → T ∗ by composing AdG with this projection.
   We now construct a semidirect product G∗ ⋊ T ∗ . Let
                                         G◦ ⋊ G∗
                          H=                               .
                               {(x−1 , Ad x) | x ∈ [G, G]}
We may assume Ad gn 6∈ Ad G◦ , for all n 6= 0, for otherwise we could assume
G is connected. Therefore, G ∼     = G◦ hAd gi injects into H. Because
                       [Ad g, T ∗ ] ⊂ [G∗ , G∗ ] = Ad[G, G],
we see that T ∗ ⊂ NH (G). Therefore, T ∗ is a group of automorphisms of G,
so we may form the semidirect product G ⋊ T ∗ .
   With these definitions of G∗ , T ∗ , S ∗ , L∗ , π, and G∗ ⋊ T ∗ in hand, we may
proceed essentially as in the proof above.
