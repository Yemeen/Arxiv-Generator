                                             Introduction
                                                 Let (G, V ) be an irreducible prehomogeneous vector space defined over a number
                                             field k, P ∈ k[V ] a relative invariant polynomial, and χ a rational character of G
                                             such that P (gx) = χ(g)P (x). Let Vkss = {x ∈ Vk | P (x) 6= 0}. For x ∈ Vkss , let Gx
                                             be the stabilizer of x, and G0x the connected component of 1 of Gx . We define L0 to
                                             be the set of x ∈ Vkss such that G0x does not have a non-trivial rational character.
                                             Then we define the zeta function for (G, V ) by the following integral
                                                                                    Z                  X
                                                                        Z(Φ, s) =            |χ(g)|s          Φ(gx)dg,
                                                                                    GA /Gk             x∈L0


                                             where Φ is a Schwartz–Bruhat function, s is a complex variable, and dg is an
                                             invariant measure.
                                                Shintani showed the convergence of Z(Φ, s) for Re(s) ≫ 0 for the spaces Sym2 k n
                                             and Sym3 k 2 (see [4], [5]). F. Sato showed the convergence of Z(Φ, s) when Gx ∩
                                             Ker(χ) is connected semi-simple (which implies that L0 = Vkss ) (see [1]). Note
                                             that his assumptions in [1] were later proved by other people. Also he considered
                                             prehomogeneous vector spaces over Q, but if (G, V ) is a prehomogeneous vector
                                             space over k, we can consider (G, V ) as a prehomogeneous vector space over Q.
                                             Then the zeta function of (G, V ) over k and the zeta function of (G, V ) over Q are
                                             the same. So his result implies the convergence of the zeta function for prehomo-
                                             geneous vector spaces as above over an arbitrary number field k. In [8], we showed
                                             the convergence of Z(Φ, s) when dim G = dim V (in this case L0 = Vkss also). These
                                             cover 23 types of irreducible reduced prehomogeneous vector spaces. Ying recently
                                             showed the convergence of Z(Φ, s) for a few cases when L0 6= Vkss . In this paper,
                                             we prove the convergence of Z(Φ, s) for prehomogeneous vector spaces of the form
                                             (G/Te, V ), where G, V are as follows:
                                                (1) G = GL(2) × GL(2) × GL(2), V = k 2 ⊗ k 2 ⊗ k 2 ,
                                                (2) G = GL(3) × GL(3) × GL(2), V = k 3 ⊗ k 3 ⊗ k 2 ,
                                                (3) G = GL(4) × GL(2), V = ∧2 k 4 ⊗ k 2 ,
                                                (4) G = GL(6) × GL(2), V = ∧2 k 6 ⊗ k 2 ,

and Te = Ker(G → GL(V )) for all the cases. These are the D4 , E6 , D5 , E7 cases
in [6].
   Note that since L0 = Vkss for the case (4), the result of M. Sato and Shintani
(see [3]) on the meromorphic continuation and the functional equation of the local
zeta function at an infinite place implies the meromorphic continuation of Z(Φ, s)
and the functional equation of the form
                                            b N − s),
                               Z(Φ, s) = Z(Φ,
where Φ b is an appropriate Fourier transform and N is a number which can easily be
figured out depending on the normalization. (see §0.3 of [8]). For the cases (1)–(3),
the meromorphic continuation of Z(Φ, s) is unknown.
   In [7], Ying considered three types of prehomogeneous vector spaces, one of which
is the case where G = GSpin(Q) × GL(2) for a non-degenerate quadratic form Q
in n ≥ 4 variables, and V is the tensor product of the standard representations.
When GSpin(Q) is split, the case n = 4 (resp. n = 6) is the case (1) (resp. case
(3)) of this paper. So cases (1) and (3) of this paper are covered by Ying. However,
our method is totally different from Ying’s method. For example, his method is
based on the consideration of Tamagawa numbers P as in F. Sato’s paper [1] and does
not prove that the incomplete theta series x∈L0 Φ(gx) satisfies the assumption
of Shintani’s lemma (see §3.4 of [8]). Our method is toP     estimate the incomplete
theta series on a Siegel set. Therefore, we can show that x∈L0 Φ(gx) satisfies the
assumption of Shintani’s lemma.
   We handle the cases (1), (2) in §2, and the cases (3), (4) in §3.


§1 Preliminaries
   We basically follow the notations of [8], but we recall the most basic ones. For a
finite set X, #X is its cardinality. If f, g are functions on a set X (not necessarily
finite), f ≪ g means that there exists a constant C such that f (x) ≤ Cg(x) for all
x ∈ X. We also use the classical notation x ≪ y when y is a much larger number
than x. We hope the meaning of this notation will be clear from the context. The
ring of adeles (resp. the group of ideles) over k is denoted by A (resp. A× ). For a
vector space V over k, VA is the adelization, and S (VA ) is the space of Schwartz–
Bruhat functions. We define R+ = {x ∈ R | x > 0}. For λ ∈ R+ , λ is the idele
                                                  1
whose component at any infinite place is λ [k:Q] and whose component at any finite
place is 1. Let |x| be the adelic absolute value of x ∈ A. Then |λ| = λ. Let
an (t1 , · · · , tn ) be the n-dimensional diagonal matrix whose (i, i)-entry is ti for all
i. We define GL(n)0A = {g ∈ GL(n)A | | det g| = 1}.
   For all the four cases in this paper, G is of the form G = GL(n1 ) × · · · GL(nf ).
(f is either 2 or 3). Let Gi = GL(ni ) for all i. Let Ti ⊂ Gi be the set of diagonal
matrices, and T = T1 × · · · Tf . Let ǫ > 0 be a sufficiently small constant. We define
         G0iA = GL(ni )0A ,
          0

  For ci = (ci1 , · · · , cini −1 ) ∈ Rni −1 , we define
wi (ci ) = ci1 (1, −1, 0, · · · , 0) + ci2 (0, 1, −1, 0, · · · , 0) + · · · + cini −1 (0, · · · , 0, 1, −1).
Let t∗i,pc be the cone generated by positive weights, i.e.

                          t∗i,pc = {wi (ci ) ∈ t∗i | ci1 , · · · , cini −1 ≥ 0}.
Apparently, the set of interior points of t∗i,pc consists of points of the form wi (ci )
where ci1 , · · · , cini −1 > 0. For c = (c1 , · · · , cf ), we define
                                   w(c) = (w1 (c1 ), · · · , wf (cf )).
  Let
                                         G0A = G01A × · · · × G0f A ,

                                         t∗pc = t∗1,pc × · · · × t∗f,pc .
  For t ∈ T+0 and y = (y1 , · · · , yf ) ∈ t∗ , we can define ty ∈ R+ in the usual
manner.
Q Q      Let ρ ∈ t∗ be half the sum of positive weights. This means that tρ =
              −1
 i  j<k (λij λik ) for

                     t = (an1 (λ11 , · · · , λ1n1 ), · · · , anf (λ11 , · · · , λf nf )).

   The Weyl group W of G is the product of the Weyl groups of GL(n1 ), · · · , GL(nf )
and we identify the Weyl group of GL(ni ) as the set of permutation matrices for
all i. The group W acts on T+0 from the left by t → gtg −1 for g ∈ W, t ∈ T+0 . We
define the left action of W on t∗ by tgy = (g −1 tg)y for g ∈ W, y ∈ t∗ , t ∈ T+0 .
   For the cases in this paper, up to a constant, Z(Φ, s) coincides with the following
integral                 Z               X
                                     λs      Φ(λg 0 x)d× λdg 0 ,
                                 R+ ×G0A /Gk        x∈L0

where the action of λ is the usual multiplication by λ, d× λ = λ−1 dλ, and dg 0 is an
invariant measure on G0A . We define
                             Z                X
                Z+ (Φ, s) =                λs      Φ(λg 0 x)d× λdg 0 .

   It is well known that there exists a compact set Ω b ⊂ G0 such that ΩT
                                                                        b 0 surjects

respectively, where d× t is an invariant measure on T+0 .
   In the following sections, we choose a coordinate system x = (x1 , · · · , xN ) of
V for each case so that there exists γi ∈ t∗ for i = 1, · · · , N and tx = (tγi xi ) for
t ∈ T+0 , x ∈ VA . The element γi is called the weight of the coordinate xi . For
x = (x1 , · · · , xN ) ∈ Vk , we define Ix = {1 ≤ i ≤ N | xi 6= 0}. Let Convx be the
convex hull of the set {γi | i ∈ Ix }.
Definition (1.2) A point x ∈ Vk is k-stable if for all g ∈ Gk , the convex hull
Convgx contains a neighborhood of the origin of t∗ .
   We showed in Proposition (3.1.4) [8] that if L0 coincides with the set of k-
stable points, Z(Φ, s) converges absolutely for Re(s) ≫ 0 and Z+ (Φ, s) is an entire
function.
   We need the following lemma in §2 to show that L0 coincides with the set of
k-stable points for the cases (1), (2).
Lemma (1.3) Suppose that L ⊂ Vkss is a Gk -invariant subset such that Convx
contains an interior point of t∗pc for any x ∈ L. Then x is k-stable for all x ∈ L.
Proof. Suppose x ∈ L. Let g ∈ W, t ∈ T+0 . We define

                                               i
                                      z }| {
                                ei = (0, · · · , 0, 1, 0, · · · , 0) ∈ Vk

for i = 1, · · · , N . Then tei = tγi ei . So

                       tgei = gg −1 tgei = g(g −1 tg)γi ei = tgγi gei .

Therefore, ConvIgx = gConvx . Since L0 is Gk -invariant, gx ∈ L0 . This implies
that gConvx contains an interior point of t∗pc . So Convx contains an interior point
of g −1 t∗pc . Note that this statement is true for all g ∈ W .
   Suppose that Convx does not contain a neighborhood of the origin of t∗ . Since
Convx is a finite convex polytope, this implies that Convx is contained in a half
space containing the origin, say {y ∈ t∗ | l(y) ≤ 0} where l(y) is a non-zero linear
form on t∗ . There exists an element g ∈ W such that l(g −1 y) is of the form

                             l(g −1 y) = l1 (y1 ) + · · · + lf (yf ),
                                  li (yi ) = ai1 yi1 + · · · + aini yini

for y = (y1 , · · · , yf ) ∈ t∗ where ai1 ≥ · · · ≥ aini are constants for i = 1, · · · , f .
   Since yi1 + · · · + yini = 0 for all i, we may assume that aij > 0 for all i, j. Also
since the linear form l is not identically zero, we may assume that there exist i0 , j0
such that ai0 j0 > ai0 j0 +1 .
   We showed that there exists an interior point w(c) = (w1 (c1 ), · · · , wf (cf )) of t∗pc
such that Convx contains the point g −1 w(c). Then

                                               f ni −1
                                               X X
                                −1
                          l(g        w(c)) =             (aij − aij+1 )cij .
                                               i=1 j=1


                                                   4
By assumption, all the terms are non-negative and at least one term is positive.
Therefore, l(g −1 w(c)) > 0. This is a contradiction. So we can conclude that Convx
contains a neighborhood of the origin.
                                                                             Q.E.D.

these prehomogeneous vector spaces as M(2, 2) ⊗ k 2 or M(3, 3) ⊗ k 2 , i.e. the space
of 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 matrices whose entries are linear forms in two variables v =
(v1 , v2 ). We express a general element of V as Mx (v) = v1 x1 + v2 x2 where x1 =
(x1,ij ), x2 = (x2,ij ) are 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 matrices. We choose x = (x1 , x2 ) as the
coordinate system of V . If g = (g1 , g2 , g3 ) is an element of GL(2) × GL(2) × GL(2)
or GL(3) × GL(3) × GL(2), the action of g is defined by

                                   gMx (v) = g1 Mx (vg3 )t g2 .

   We define Fx (v) = det Mx (v). Then Fx is a binary quadratic or cubic form. It
was proved in [2] that Vkss is the set of x such that Fx has distinct factors over the
closure k̄ of k. We showed in [6] that L0 is the set of x such that Fx is irreducible.
Theorem (2.1) The set L0 coincides with the set of k-stable points. Therefore,
Z(Φ, s) converges absolutely for Re(s) ≫ 0 and Z+ (Φ, s) is an entire function.
Proof. Suppose that Fx is irreducible. Then for any v ∈ k 2 \ {(0, 0)}, Fx (v) 6= 0,
i.e. Mx (v) is a non-singular matrix. In particular x1 , x2 are non-singular matrices.
Let t = (t1 , t2 , t3 ) ∈ T+0 , where

       t1 = a3 (λ11 , λ12 , λ13 ), t2 = a3 (λ21 , λ22 , λ23 ), t3 =   a2 (λ31 , λ−1

and λ11 λ12 λ13 = λ21 λ22 λ23 = 1.
   The set L0 is clearly Gk -invariant. So by Lemma (1.3), we only have to show
that for any x ∈ L0 , Convx contains an interior point of t∗pc . Let γi,jk be the weight
of the coordinate xi,jk for all i, j, k. The element γi,jk can be expressed in the form
γi,jk = w(di,jk ) (di,jk may not be in t∗pc ).
   We first consider the case (1). The following lemma is easy to verify and the
proof is left to the reader.
Lemma (2.2) (1) d1,11 = ( 21 , 12 , 21 ).
(2) d1,12 = ( 12 , − 21 , 12 ).
(3) d1,21 = (− 21 , 21 , 12 ).
   Note that d2,jk can be obtained by replacing the last 21 in d1,jk by − 12 .
   Suppose x ∈ L0 . If x1,11 6= 0, then γ1,11 ∈ Convx and γ1,11 is an interior point
of t∗pc by the above lemma.
   Suppose x1,11 = 0. Then since x1 is non-singular, x1,12 , x1,21 6= 0. Moreover
if x2,11 = 0, we can choose v ∈ k 2 \ {0} so that Mx (v) is singular. This contra-
dicts to the assumption x ∈ L0 . So we may assume that x2,11 6= 0. Therefore,

                                                 5
γ1,12 , γ1,21 , γ2,11 ∈ Convx . This implies that γ1,12 + γ1,21 + γ2,11 ∈ Convx also and
                                                             

                            d1,12 + d1,21 + d2,11 =     , ,     .
                                                       2 2 2

So γ1,12 + γ1,21 + γ2,11 is an interior point of Convx . This completes the proof of
Theorem (2.1) for the case (1).
  Next, we consider the case (2). The following lemma is easy to verify and the
proof is left to the reader.
Lemma (2.3) (1) d1,11 = (( 32 , 31 ), ( 32 , 31 ), 12 ).
(2) d1,12 = (( 32 , 31 ), (− 31 , 13 ), 21 ).
(3) d1,13 = (( 32 , 31 ), (− 31 , − 23 ), 12 ).
(4) d1,21 = ((− 13 , 31 ), ( 32 , 13 ), 21 ).
(5) d1,22 = ((− 13 , 31 ), (− 13 , 31 ), 12 ).
(6) d1,31 = ((− 13 , − 32 ), ( 32 , 31 ), 12 ).
   Note that d2,jk can be obtained by replacing the last 12 in d1,jk by − 12 .
   Suppose x ∈ L0 . If x1,11 6= 0, then γ1,11 ∈ Convx and γ1,11 is an interior point
of t∗pc .
   Suppose x1,11 = 0, x1,12 , x1,21 6= 0. Then γ1,12 , γ1,21 ∈ Convx . So γ1,12 + γ1,21 ∈
Convx also and                                          

                                           3 3        3 3
So γ1,12 + γ1,21 is an interior point of t∗pc .
   Consider the following two cases:
   (1) x1,11 = 0, x1,12 = 0, and x1,21 6= 0,
   (2) x1,11 = 0, x1,21 = 0, and x1,12 6= 0.
   Since these cases are similar, we only consider the case (1). Since x1 is a non-
singular matrix, x1,13 6= 0. If x2,11 = x2,12 = 0, we can choose v ∈ k 2 \ {0} so
that v1 x1,13 + v2 x2,13 = 0. This contradicts to the assumption x ∈ L0 . So we may
assume that either x2,11 6= 0 or x2,12 6= 0. Since

                                d2,11 = d2,12 + ((0, 0), (1, 0), 0),

we only consider the case x2,12 6= 0.
  With these assumptions, γ1,21 , γ1,13 , γ2,12 ∈ Convx . Then

                               3γ1,21 + 2γ1,13 + 2γ2,12 ∈ Convx

So 3γ1,21 + 2γ1,13 + 2γ2,12 is an interior point of t∗pc .
   Suppose x1,11 = x1,12 = x1,21 = 0. Then since x1 is a non-singular matrix,
x1,13 , x1,22 , x1,31 6= 0. Suppose x2,11 6= 0. Then

                             γ1,13 + γ1,22 + γ1,31 + γ2,11 ∈ Convx

So γ1,13 + γ1,22 + γ1,31 + γ2,11 is an interior point of t∗pc .
  Suppose x1,11 = x1,12 = x1,21 = x2,11 = 0. Then if either x2,12 = 0 or x2,21 = 0,
we can choose v ∈ k 2 \ {0} so that v1 x1 + v2 x2 is singular, which is a contradiction.
So x2,12 , x2,21 6= 0. By assumption, x1,13 , x1,22 , x1,31 6= 0 also. Then

So γ1,13 + γ1,22 + γ1,31 + γ2,12 + γ2,21 is an interior point of t∗pc . This completes the
proof of Theorem (2.1) for the case (2).
                                                                                   Q.E.D.

§3 D5 , E7 cases
   We consider the cases (3), (4) in the introduction in this section. We consider
these cases as the space of 4 × 4 or 6 × 6 alternating matrices whose entries are
linear forms in two variables v = (v1 , v2 ). We express a general element of V
as Mx (v) = v1 x1 + v2 x2 where x1 = (x1,ij ), x2 = (x2,ij ) are 4 × 4 or 6 × 6
alternating matrices. We choose x = (x1 , x2 ) as the coordinate system of V (we
only consider xi,jk such that j > k). If g = (g1 , g2 ) is an element of GL(4) × GL(2)
or GL(6) × GL(2), the action of g is defined by

                               gMx (v) = g1 Mx (vg2 )t g1 .

Since Mx (v) is an alternating matrix, there exists a binary quadratic or cubic form
Fx (v) such that det Mx (v) = Fx (v)2 (Fx (v) is the Pfaffian of Mx (v)). It was proved
in [2] that Vkss is the set of x such that Fx (v) has distinct factors. We showed in [6]
that L0 is the set of x such that Fx is irreducible for the case (3) and that L0 = Vkss
for the case (4).
Theorem (3.1) The integral Z(Φ, s) converges absolutely and locally uniformly for
Re(s) ≫ 0 and Z+ (Φ, s) is an entire function.
Proof. Unlike the cases (1), (2), there are no k-stable points, so we have to be a
little more subtle for these cases. Let Ψ be as in §1. For L ⊂ Vk , we define
                                                X

for λ ∈ R+ , t ∈ Tǫ0 .                                        R
   We estimate ΘL0 (Ψ, λt). Note that if y ∈ t∗ , the integral T 0 ty−2ρ d× t converges
                                                                ǫ
absolutely if −(y − 2ρ) is an interior point of t∗pc .

              t1 = a6 (λ11 , λ12 , λ13 , λ14 , λ15 , λ16 ), t2 = a2 (λ21 , λ−1
                                                                            21 ) case (4).

   Let γi,jk be the weight of the coordinate xi,jk for all i, j, k (j > k). The element
γi,jk can be expressed in the form γi,jk = w(di,jk ), where di,jk ∈ R4 or R6 .
   Let σ = Re(s). We will prove that the function λσ ΘL0 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable
on R+ ×Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0. What we are going to do is to divide L0 into a union of finite
number of (not necessarily Gk -stable) subsets Li and to estimate ΘLi (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ
by a finite number of functions of the form λpN tw(cN ) where pN ∈ R, cN ∈ R4 or
R6 depend on a finite number of positive numbers N . These numbers should have
the property that if we choose N appropriately, pN ≪ 0 and all the entries of cN
are negative.
   If λ ≥ 1, for any σ ∈ R, we can choose N depending on σ so that σ + pN < 0 and
all the entries of cN are negative. This implies that the function λσ ΘLi (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ
is integrable on [1, ∞) × Tǫ0 . If λ ≤ 1, we fix N so that all the entries of cN
are negative. Then if σ + pN > 0, the function λσ ΘLi (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on
(0, 1] × Tǫ0 . Since σ is arbitrary for the convergence of the integral on [1, ∞) × Tǫ0 ,
this proves the convergence of Z(Φ, s) for Re(s) ≫ 0 and Z+ (Φ, s) for all s.

for λ ∈ R+ , t ∈ Tǫ0 .
   Functions of the form hI (λ, t) often appear in estimates of various incomplete
theta series because our main tool is Lemma (1.2.6) [8]. So we first consider the
function hI (λ, t). We start with the following two observations whose proofs are
easy and are left to the reader.
Lemma (3.5)
(1) If I1 ⊂ I2`⊂ I0 , then hI1 (λ, t) ≤ hI2 (λ, t).
(2) If I = I1 I2 ⊂ I0 , then hI (λ, t) = hI1 (λ, t)hI2 (λ, t).
Lemma (3.6)                                             Y
                              hI (λ, t) = sup                      (λ−1 t−γi,jk ).

   This proves the lemma.

  For the rest of this section, λ ∈ R+ , t ∈ Tǫ0 . So in inequalities like Lemma (3.7),
we will not mention that it is uniform with respect to λ ∈ R+ , t ∈ Tǫ0 .
  We first consider the case (3). The following lemma is easy to verify and the
proof is left to the reader.
Lemma (3.8) (1) d1,21 = (( 21 , 1, 21 ), 12 ).
(2) d1,31 = (( 21 , 0, 21 ), 12 ).
(3) d1,41 = (( 21 , 0, − 21 ), 21 ).
(4) d1,32 = ((− 12 , 0, 12 ), 21 ).
(5) d1,42 = ((− 12 , 0, − 21 ), 12 ).
(6) d1,43 = ((− 21 , −1, − 21 ), 21 ).
   Note that d2,jk can be obtained by replacing the last 12 in d1,jk by − 12 . Also if
we put d0 = ((−3, −4, −3), −1), then −2ρ = w(d0 ). By Lemma (3.7), hI0 (λ, t) ≪
sup(1, λ−12 )t−w(c0 ) , where

(3.9)                                       c0 = cI0 = −((3, 2, 3), 3).

Definition (3.10) (1) L1 = {x ∈ L0 | x1,21 6= 0}.

                                                              9
(2) L2 = {x ∈ L0 | x1,21 = 0, x1,31 6= 0}.
(3) L3 = {x ∈ L0 | x1,21 = 0, x1,31 = 0}.
   Apparently, L0 = L1 ∪ L2 ∪ L3 . So we estimate ΘLi (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ for i = 1, 2, 3.
(1) Consider L1 .
   Let I = I0 \ {(1, 2, 1)}. By Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any N ≥ 1,

                     ΘL1 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−N t−Nγ1,21 hI (λ, t)t−2ρ .

   By Lemma (3.7),

                       hI (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−11 )tw(((3,2,3),3)),
                       hI (λ, t)t−2ρ ≪ sup(1, λ−11 )tw(((0,−2,0),2)).

Since all the entries of d1,21 are positive, λσ ΘL1 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0
for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) × Tǫ0 for all σ.
(2) Consider L2 .
   Let I = I0 \ {(1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1)}. By Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any N ≥ 1,

                     ΘL2 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−N t−Nγ1,31 hI (λ, t)t−2ρ .

   By Lemma (3.7),

                       h2 (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−10 )tw(((3,2,3),3)),
                       h2 (λ, t)t−2ρ ≪ sup(1, λ−10 )tw(((0,−2,0),2)).

So for any N ≥ 1,
                                                                            1   1   1
           ΘL2 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−N sup(1, λ−10 )tw(((0,−2,0),2)−N(( 2 ,0, 2 ), 2 )) .

   Since all the entries of ((0, −2, 0), 2) − N (( 21 , 0, 12 ), 21 ) are negative if N > 4,
λσ ΘL1 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) × Tǫ0 for all σ.
(3) Consider L3 .
   Suppose x ∈ L3 . Then since x1 is non-singular, x1,32 , x1,41 6= 0. We define
I = I0 \ {(1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 3, 2), (1, 4, 1)}. Then by Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any
N ≥ 1,
                   ΘL3 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−2N t−N(γ1,32 +γ1,41 ) hI (λ, t).
   By Lemma (3.7),
                                                     5   5
                     hI (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−8 )tw(( 2 ,2, 2 ),3) ),
                                                              1         1
                     hI (λ, t)t−2ρ ≪ sup(1, λ−8 )tw((− 2 ,−2,− 2 ),2) ).

So for any N ≥ 1,
                                                          1         1
        ΘL3 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−2N sup(1, λ−8 )tw(((− 2 ,−2,− 2 ),2)−N(d1,32 +d1,41 )) .

                                               10
   Since d1,32 + d1,41 = ((0, 0, 0), 1), all the entries of
                                       
                             1        1
                            − , −2, −    , 2 − N (d1,32 + d1,41 )
                             2        2

are negative if N > 2. Therefore, λσ ΘL1 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for
σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) × Tǫ0 for all σ.
   This completes the proof of Theorem (3.1) for the case (3).
  Next, we consider the case (4). The following lemma is easy to verify and the
proof is left to the reader.
Lemma (3.11) (1) d1,21 = (( 23 , 34 , 1, 23 , 13 ), 21 ).
(2) d1,31 = (( 32 , 31 , 1, 23 , 31 ), 12 ).
(3) d1,41 = (( 32 , 31 , 0, 23 , 31 ), 12 ).
(4) d1,51 = (( 32 , 31 , 0, − 31 , 31 ), 12 ).
(5) d1,61 = (( 32 , 31 , 0, − 31 , − 32 ), 12 ).
(6) d1,32 = ((− 31 , 31 , 1, 23 , 31 ), 12 ).
(7) d1,42 = ((− 13 , 31 , 0, 23 , 31 ), 12 ).
(8) d1,52 = ((− 13 , 31 , 0, − 31 , 31 ), 12 ).
(9) d1,62 = ((− 31 , 31 , 0, − 31 , − 32 ), 12 ).
(10) d1,43 = ((− 13 , − 32 , 0, 23 , 31 ), 12 ).
(11) d1,53 = ((− 31 , − 32 , 0, − 31 , 13 ), 21 ).
(12) d1,63 = ((− 13 , − 32 , 0, − 31 , − 32 ), 12 ).
(13) d1,54 = ((− 31 , − 32 , −1, − 31 , 31 ), 12 ).
(14) d1,64 = ((− 31 , − 32 , −1, − 31 , − 32 ), 21 ).
(15) d1,65 = ((− 13 , − 32 , −1, − 34 , − 32 ), 21 ).
   Note that d2,jk can be obtained by replacing the last 12 in d1,jk by − 21 . Also
if we put d0 = ((−5, −8, −9, −8, −5), −1), then −2ρ = w(d0 ). By Lemma (3.7),
hI0 (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−30 )t−w(c0 ) , where
                                                                           

(11) If x ∈ L17 or L18 , x2,21 6= 0.
Proof. Note that if 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 18, i, j 6= 3, 14, and i 6= j, then Li ∩ Lj = ∅.
   It is easy to see that if x ∈ Vkss and x ∈     / L1 , L2 , then x ∈ L3 . Suppose that
x ∈ L3 and x1,43 6= 0. Then if x ∈ / L4 , · · · , L7 , x1,ij = 0 for i = 1, 2, j = 2, · · · , 6.
Suppose x2,21 = 0. Then by considering the cofactor expansion with respect to
the first two columns, det Mx (v) is a product of v22 and a sum of determinants of
matrices of the form
                                                                  

    The determinant of the above matrix clearly is divisible by v22 . So Fx (v) is
divisible by v22 , which contradicts to the assumption x ∈ Vkss . This implies that
x2,21 6= 0 and x ∈ L8 .
                                                                             `11
    Suppose that x ∈ L3 and x1,43 = 0. If x1,51 or x1,52 6= 0, then x ∈ i=9 Li . So
we assume that x ∈ L3 and x1,43 = x1,51 = x1,52 = 0. Then x1,61 6= 0 or x ∈ L14 . If
x1,61 , x1,53 6= 0, x ∈ L12 . Suppose x1,61 6= 0, x1,53 = 0. Then if x1,54 = 0, x1,jk = 0
for j, k = 1, · · · , 5. So by the cofactor expansion with respect to the last row and
the last column, det Mx (v) is divisible by v24 , which is a contradiction. Therefore,
x1,54 6= 0, which implies that x ∈ L13 .
    Suppose x ∈ L14 . If x1,62 , x1,53 6= 0, then x ∈ L15 . Also if x1,62 = 0, x1,53 6= 0,
then x ∈ L17 . Suppose x1,62 6= 0, x1,53 = 0. If x1,54 = 0, then x1,jk = 0 for
j, k = 1, · · · , 5, which cannot happen. So x1,54 6= 0, which implies that x ∈ L16 .
Suppose x1,62 = x1,53 = 0. Then x1,54 6= 0 for the same reason. If x1,63 = 0, the
first three columns of x1 are zero. So det Mx (v) is divisible by v23 . But since Mx (v)
is an alternating matrix, det Mx (v) is divisible by v24 , which is a contradiction. This
proves (1).
    The statements (2), (3), (5) are clear.

                                                    12
   Consider the statement (4). Let x ∈ L7 . Then the first column of x1 is zero.
Suppose x2,j1 = 0 for j = 2, · · · , 5. Then by the cofactor expansion with respect
to the (6, 1), (1, 6)-entries, det Mx (v) is a product of x21,61 v22 and the determinant
of an alternating matrix of the form
                                                                          

                        v1                         + v2                   .
                             0       ∗       0   ∗          ∗     ∗    0   ∗

   The determinant of the above matrix is divisible by v22 . So Fx (v) is divisible by
v22 ,
    which is a contradiction. Therefore, if x ∈ L7 , there exists 2 ≤ j ≤ 5 such that
x2,j1 6= 0.
   Consider the statement (6). Suppose x ∈ L11 . If the statement of (6) is false,
there exists x ∈ L3 such that

(3.15)      x1,43 = x1,51 = x1,61 = x2,21 = x2,31 = x2,41 = 0, x1,52 6= 0.

   We show that (3.15) cannot happen. Suppose (3.15) is satisfied. Then Mx (v) is
of the following form
                                                                                  

  If x2,51 = x2,61 = 0, det Mx (v) is identically zero, which is a contradiction. So
we assume that x2,51 or x2,61 6= 0, Let g1 ∈ GL(6)k be an element of the form
                                                                 

                                                              A

where A ∈ GL(2)k . By applying an element of the form g = (g1 , I2 ) ∈ GL(6)k ×
GL(2)k , we may assume that x2,21 = x2,31 = x2,41 = x2,51 = 0, x2,61 6= 0. Note
that by the action of g, det Mx (v) changes by a non-zero constant and the form of
x1 does not change.
   Therefore, det Mx (v) is a product of x22,61 v22 and the determinant of an alternat-
ing matrix of the form
                                                                          

                                                     13
   The determinant of the above matrix is divisible by v22 . This implies that Fx (v)
is divisible by v22 , which is a contradiction.
   Consider the statement (7). Let x ∈ L12 . If x2,jk = 0 for j = 2, 3, 4, k = 1, 2,
Mx (v) is of the form                                
                                   0 A2            0 B2
                              v1            + v1          ,
                                   A1 ∗            B1 ∗
where A1 , B1 are 2 × 2 and A2 , B2 are 4 × 4. Also the first row of A1 , the first and
the second columns of A2 are zero. Since det Mx (v) = det(v1 A1 + v2 B1 ) det(v1 A2 +
v2 B2 ), det Mx (v) is divisible by v23 . Since Mx (v) is an alternating matrix, det Mx (v)
is divisible by v24 , which is a contradiction. Therefore, there exists 1 ≤ k < j ≤ 4
such that x2,jk 6= 0.
   Consider the statement (8). Let x ∈ L13 . If x2,21 = x2,31 = x2,32 = 0, Mx (v) is
of the form                                                 
                                  0 −t A              0 −t B
                             v1                + v1              ,
                                  A       ∗           B     ∗
where A, B are 3 × 3 and the first and the second rows of A are zero. Since
det Mx (v) = det(v1 A+v2 B)2 , det Mx (v) is divisible by v24 , which is a contradiction.
Therefore, x2,21 or x2,31 or x2,32 6= 0.
   Consider the statement (9). Let x ∈ L15 . Suppose x2,21 = x2,31 = x2,41 = 0.
Then by the cofactor expansion with respect to the first row and the first column,
det Mx (v) is a product of v22 and the determinant of a matrix of the form
                                                              

   Therefore, det Mx (v) is divisible by v24 , which is a contradiction. So x2,21 or x2,31
or x2,41 6= 0.
   Consider the statement (10). Let x ∈ L16 . Suppose x2,21 = x2,31 = 0. Then by
the cofactor expansion with respect to the first row and the first column, det Mx (v)
is a product of v22 and the determinant of a matrix of the form
                                                              

                       v1                 + v2                .
                            0   0   ∗   ∗          ∗   ∗   ∗   ∗

   Therefore, det Mx (v) is divisible by v23 . Since Mx (v) is an alternating matrix,
det Mx (v) is divisible by v24 , which is a contradiction. So x2,21 or x2,31 6= 0.
   Consider the statement (11). Let x ∈ L17 or L18 . Then x1,62 = 0. . Suppose
x2,21 = 0. Then by considering the cofactor expansion with respect to the first row
and the first column, det Mx (v) is a product of v22 and the determinant of a matrix
of the form                                                 
                            0 0 ∗ ∗                ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗

                            0 ∗ ∗ ∗                ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗
                            0 ∗ ∗ ∗                ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗

                                            14
   So, det Mx (v) is divisible by v23 , which is a contradiction. Therefore, x2,21 6= 0.
   This completes the proof of Proposition (3.14).
                                                                                 Q.E.D.
   The following proposition is an immediate consequence of Proposition (3.14).
Proposition (3.16)
                                                    X
                             ΘVkss (Ψ, λt) =               ΘLi (Ψ, λt).
                                               1≤i≤18
                                               i6=3,14



   We now consider individual cases.
(1) Consider L1 .
   Note that t−γi,21 , t−γi,31 ≪ t−γi,41 . So by Lemma (1.2.6) [8] and Lemma (3.7),
for any N ≥ 1,

                 ΘL1 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−N t−Nγ1,41 hI0 (λ, t)tw(d0 )
                                    ≪ λ−N sup(1, λ−30 )tw(d0 −c0 −Nd1,41 ) .

   Since
                                                                                             
                                  5             5         15                 2 1    2 1         1
      d0 − c0 − N d1,41 =           , 0, −3, 0,         ,          −N         , , 0, ,        ,         ,
                                  3             3          2                 3 3    3 3         2

all the entries of −N d1,41 − c0 + d0 are negative if N is large. Also if N is large,
the exponent of λ tends to −∞.
    Therefore, λσ ΘL1 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) ×
  0
Tǫ for all σ.
(2) Consider L2 .
   Let I = I0 \ {(1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 4, 1)}. For 2 ≤ β ≤ 6, we define

                           L2,1β = {x ∈ L2 | x1,32 , x1,β1 6= 0},
                           L2,2β = {x ∈ L2 | x1,42 , x1,β1 6= 0},
                           L2,3β = {x ∈ L2 | x1,32 , x2,β1 6= 0},
                           L2,4β = {x ∈ L2 | x1,42 , x2,β1 6= 0}.

(We only consider β = 5, 6 for L2,1β , L2,2β .)
  By Proposition (3.14)(2), L2 = ∪α,β L2,αβ . So
                                         X
                         ΘL2 (Ψ, λt) ≤        ΘL2,αβ (Ψ, λt).
                                               α,β

   We consider L2,1β first.
   Let I ′ = {(1, 3, 2), (1, β, 1)}, I ′′ = I \ {(1, 3, 2), (1, β, 1)}. We define

                        V ′ = {x ∈ V | xi,jk = 0 for (i, j, k) ∈
                                                               / I ′ },
                       V ′′ = {x ∈ V | xi,jk = 0 for (i, j, k) ∈
                                                               / I ′′ }.

                                                15
The subsets V ′ , V ′′ are subspaces of V , and L2,1β can be considered as a subset of
Vk′ ⊕ Vk′′ . For x ∈ V ′ ⊕ V ′′ , let p′ (x), p′′ (x) be the projections to the first factor and
the second factor respectively.
    By Lemma (1.2.5) [8], there exist 0 ≤ Ψ′ ∈ S (VA′ ), 0 ≤ Ψ′′ ∈ S (VA′′ ) such that
                                               X
                    ΘL2,1β (Ψ, λt) ≪                   Ψ′ (p′ (λtx))Ψ′′ (p′′ (λtx)).
                                             x∈L2,1β


We define                                                X
                                Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt) =                            Ψ′ (λtx),
                                                        x∈V ′
                                                            k
                                                  x1,32 ,x1,β1 ∈k×
                                                    X
                                Θ′′ (Ψ′′ , λt) =            Ψ′′ (λtx).
                                                   x∈Vk′′

Then
                           ΘL2,1β (Ψ, λt) ≪ Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt)Θ′′ (Ψ′′ , λt).
   By Lemma (1.2.6) [8],

                                Θ′′ (Ψ′′ , λt) ≪ hI ′′ (λ, t) ≤ hI (λ, t).

   We estimate hI (λ, t). We define

                 I1 = {(2, j, 1) for j = 2, 3, 4},
                                                                                
                          (i, 5, 1), (i, 6, 1), (i, 3, 2), (i, 4, 2), (i, 5, 2),
                 I2 =                                                              ,
                        (i, 6, 2), (i, 4, 3), (i, 5, 3), (i, 5, 4) for i = 1, 2
                 I3 = I \ (I1 ∪ I2 ) = {(i, 6, k) for i = 1, 2, k = 3, 4, 5}.
                   ` `
Then I = I1 I2 I3 . If (i, j, k) ∈ I1 , all the entries except for the last of
di,jk are positive. If (i, j, k) ∈ I2 , di,jk is of the form ((c1 , ∗, ∗, ∗, −c1), ∗) or
((∗, c2 , ∗, −c2 , ∗), ∗).
By Lemma (3.7),
                                                                                    3
                          hI1 (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−3 )tw(((0,0,0,0,0), 2 )) ,
                                                                                    3
                          hI3 (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−6 )tw(((2,4,4,4,4), 2 )) .

   We have to be a little more careful about hI2 (λ, t). By Lemma (3.6),
                                                                           Y
                      hI2 (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−18 ) sup                                t−γi,jk .
                                                            I2′ ⊂I2
                                                                      (i,j,k)∈I2′


By the proof of Lemma (3.7), for each I2′ ⊂ I2 , there exist a, b ∈ R such that
                     Y                             2 8      4 4       9
                                t−γi,jk ≪ tw((( 3 , 3 ,2, 3 , 3 ), 2 )+((a,b,0,−b,−a),0)) .
                  (i,j,k)∈I2′


                                                      16
So there exist a finite number of real numbers a1 , · · · , al , b1 , · · · , bl such that

Moreover, − 43 ≤ ah ≤ 4, − 83 ≤ bh ≤ 43 for all h.
   Let

Then we get the following lemma by the above considerations.
Lemma (3.18)

                                                    l
                                                    X                                                l
                                                                                                     X
                                                                w(qh )
           hI (λ, t)t   −2ρ
                              ≪ sup(1, λ  −27
                                                )           t            ≪ sup(1, λ        −27
                                                                                                 )         tw(ph ) .
                                                    h=1                                              h=1


   Therefore,
                                                                             l
                                                                             X
                 ΘL2,1β (Ψ, λt)t    −2ρ
                                          ≪ sup(1, λ             −27
                                                                         )         Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt)tw(ph ) .
                                                                             h=1


This implies that we only have to estimate functions of the form Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt)tw(ph ) .
   For L2,2β , L2,3β , L2,4β , exactly the same argument works replacing I ′ by I ′ =
{(1, 4, 2), (1, β, 1)}, {(1, 3, 2), (2, β, 1)}, {(1, 4, 2), (2, β, 1)} respectively.
   By Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any N1 , N2 ≥ 1,

           Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt)tw(ph ) ≪ λ−N1 −N2 sup(1, λ−27 )tw(ph −N1 d1,32 −N2 d1,β1 ) .

   For L2,2β , etc., we get the same estimate replacing d1,32 or d1,β1 by d1,42 or d2,β1 .
However, since t−γ1,32 ≪ t−γ1,42 and t−γ1,β1 , t−γ2,β1 ≪ t−γ2,61 for all β, we only have
to consider functions of the form

                         λ−N1 −N2 sup(1, λ−27 )tw(ph −N1 d1,42 −N2 d2,61 ) .

   The point here is that we can choose N1 , N2 for each h separately. If we had
used Lemma (1.2.6) [8] directly to ΘL2,1β (Ψ, λt), we get an estimate by the function

                                                                                       l
                                                                                       X
                                                          −N1 γ1,32 −N2 γ1,β1
                   λ    −N1 −N2
                                  sup(1, λ     −27
                                                     )t                                      tw(ph ) ,
                                                                                       h=1

and the choice of N1 , N2 must be the same for all h. This is the reason why we had
to separate the two non-zero coordinates to start with.

                                                           17
  It is easy to see that

                                                                  2

We choose N1 , N2 of the form N1 = 2N3 + N4 , N2 = N3 + N5 , where N3 ≥
1, N4 , N5 ≥ 0. Then

     ph − N1 d1,42 − N2 d2,61

                 3                      3        2

  If ah ≥ 0, we choose N4 = 4 + 3ah , N5 = 0. Then

  ph − N1 d1,42 − N2 d2,61
                                                                          
               4 + 3ah               8 + 6ah               4 + 3ah   13 − N3

Since ah ≥ 0,
                               4 + 3ah    8 + 6ah    4 + 3ah
                           −           ,−         ,−         ≤ 0.
                                  3          3          2
Therefore,
                                                                             13−N3
                tw(ph −N1 d1,42 −N2 d2,61 ) ≪ tw(((−1,−N3 ,−3,−N3 ,−1),        2     ))
                                                                                          ,

  If ah ≤ 0, we choose N4 = 4, N5 = − 3a2h . Then

   ph − N1 d1,42 − N2 d2,61

Since − 43 ≤ ah for all h,

                            3  2    3  2         4
Therefore,
                                                                             13−N3
                tw(ph −N1 d1,42 −N2 d2,61 ) ≪ tw(((−1,−N3 ,−3,−N3 ,−1),        2     ))
                                                                                          ,
                λ−N4 −N5 ≪ sup(λ−4 , λ−10 ) = λ−4 sup(1, λ−6 ).

  By the above considerations,
                                                                                              13−N3

                                                  18
This bound does not depend on α, β, h. So for any N3 ≥ 1,
                                                                                              13−N3

                                                                                                          .

      Therefore, λσ ΘL2 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) ×
Tǫ0   for all σ.
(3) Consider L4 .
   Let I = I0 \ {(1, 2, 1), · · · , (1, 5, 1), (1, 3, 2), (1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 3)}. Then by Lemma
(1.2.6) [8], for any N ≥ 1,

                    ΘL4 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−3N t−N(γ1,43 +2γ1,51 ) hI (λ, t)t−2ρ .

      By Lemma (3.7),
                                                          17     2        1 20   15
                      hI (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−23 )tw(( 3 ,8− 3 ,3,8− 3 , 3 ), 2 ) ,
                                                                2     2      1 5      13
                      hI (λ, t)t−2ρ ≪ sup(1, λ−23 )tw(( 3 ,− 3 ,−3,− 3 , 3 ), 2 ) .

      It is easy to see that
                                                                    
                                                                   3
                               d1,43 + 2d1,51   = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1),     .
                                                                   2
Since the first, the fifth, and the last entries are positive, all the entries of
                                             
                       2 2           1 5     13
                         , − , −3, − ,     ,      − N (d1,43 + 2d1,51 )
                       3 3           3 3     2
are negative.
   Therefore, λσ ΘL4 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) ×
Tǫ0 for all σ.
(4) Consider L5 .
   Let L5,αβ = {x ∈ L5 | xα,β1 6= 0 for α = 1, 2, β = 2, · · · , 6}. Then L5 =
∪α,β L5,αβ .
   We define

          I = I0 \ {(1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 4, 1), (1, 5, 1), (1, 3, 2), (1, 4, 2), (1, 5, 2)}.

Then hI (λ, t) has the same bound as in Lemma (3.18) with ah , bh , qh ∈ R for
h = 1, · · · , l.
  We fix α, β. Let I ′ = {(1, 4, 3), (1, 5, 2), (α, β, 1)}. For Ψ′ ∈ S (VA′ ), we define
                                               X
                        Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt) =                    Ψ′ (λtx).
                                                       x∈V ′
                                                           k
                                               x1,43 ,x1,52 ,xα,β,1



By a similar consideration as before, there exists 0 ≤ Ψ′ ∈ S (VA′ ) such that
                                                                h
                                                                X
                   ΘL5,αβ (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ sup(1, λ−27 )                 Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt)tw(qh ) .
                                                                l=1

                                                    19
  We consider each term. By Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any N1 , N2 , N3 ≥ 1,

           Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt)tw(qh ) ≪ λ−N1 −N2 −N3 tw(qh −N1 d1,43 −N2 d1,52 −N3 dα,β1 ) .

Since t−γα,β1 ≪ t−γ2,61 for all α, β as above, we only consider the case (α, β) = (2, 6).
   It is easy to see that
                                                                   
                                                                  1
                       d1,43 + d1,52 + d2,61   = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0),     .
                                                                  2

So we put N1 = N4 +N5 , N2 = N4 +N6 , N3 = N4 +N7 , where N4 ≥ 1, N5 , N6 , N7 ≥
0.
   Let W = {(a, b, 0, −b, −a) | a, b ∈ R} ⊂ R5 . The following lemma and its
corollary are easy to verify and the proofs are left to the reader.
Lemma (3.19) The convex hull of

Corollary (3.20) For any a, b ∈ R, there exist c1 , c2 , c3 ≥ 0 such that
                                                               

       = (a, b, 0, −b, −a).

  By the above Corollary, we choose N5 , N6 , N7 ≥ 0 so that
                                                                

     = ah − , bh , 0, −bh , −ah +     .
            3                     3

Then
                                                               4         8   13−N4
         Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt)tw(qh ) ≪ λ−3N4 −N5 −N6 −N7 tw(((−1,− 3 ,−3,− 3 ,−1),     2     ))
                                                                                          .

Since there are finitely many possibilities for h, there exist c1 , c2 ≥ 0 such that
                                                                     4       8     13−N4
    ΘL5,αβ (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−3N4 −c1 sup(1, λ−27−c2 )tw(((−1,− 3 ,−3,− 3 ,−1),         2        ))
                                                                                                   .

The right hand side does not depend on α, β, h.
   Therefore, λσ ΘL5 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) ×
Tǫ0 for all σ.
(5) Consider L6 .

                                               20
  For α = 2, · · · , 5, β = 1, 2, α > β, we define L6,αβ = {x ∈ L6 | x2,αβ 6= 0}. Then
by Proposition (3.14)(3), L6 = ∪α,β L6,αβ . Since t−γ2,αβ ≪ t−γ2,52 for all α, β as
above, we only consider the case (α, β) = (5, 2). If x ∈ L6,52 , x1,43 , x1,61 , x2,52 6= 0.
So by the same argument as in (4), λσ ΘL6 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for
σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) × Tǫ0 for all σ.
(6) Consider L7 .
   For α = 2, · · · , 5, we define L7,α = {x ∈ L7 | x2,α1 6= 0}. Then by Proposition
(3.14)(4), L7 = ∪α L7,α . Since t−γ2,α1 ≪ t−γ2,51 for all α as above, we only consider
the case α = 5
   Let
            I = I0 \ {(1, j, k) for j = 2, · · · , 6, k = 1, 2, j > k, (1, 4, 3)}.
Then by Lemma (3.7),
                                                              2        4 16    15
                  hI (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−20 )tw(((5,8− 3 ,6,8− 3 , 3 ), 2 )) ,
                                                                   2          4 1        13
                  hI (λ, t)t−2ρ ≪ sup(1, λ−20 )tw(((0,− 3 ,−3,− 3 , 3 ), 2 )) .

   By Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any N1 , N2 , N3 ≥ 1,

          ΘL7,5 (Ψ, λt) ≪ sup(1, λ−20 )λ−N1 −N2 −N3
                                          2        4 1   13
                             × tw(((0,− 3 ,−3,− 3 , 3 ), 2 )−N1 d1,43 −N2 d1,62 −N3 d2,51 ) .

   It is easy to see that
                                                                                   
                                                                              1
                     3d1,43 + 2d1,62 + 4d2,51 =              (1, 0, 0, 0, 1),             .
                                                                              2

So if we choose N1 = 3N4 , N2 = 2N4 , N3 = 4N4 and N4 ≫ 0, all the entries of
                                    
                   2        4 1     13
               0, − , −3, − ,     ,      − N1 d1,43 − N2 d1,62 − N3 d2,51
                   3        3 3     2
                                                     
                         2        4 1           13 − N4
            =     −N4 , − , −3, − , − N4 ,
                         3        3 3               2

are negative.
   Therefore, λσ ΘL7 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) ×
Tǫ0 for all σ.
(7) Consider L8 .
   By Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any N ≥ 1,

               ΘL8 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ λ−5N tw(d0 −N(3d1,43 +2d2,21 )) hI0 (λ, t).

   It is easy to see that
                                                                              

                       3d1,43 + 2d2,21 =            , , 2, ,               ,         .
                                                   3 3     3 3               2

                                                21
   Since all the entries of the above element are positive, λσ ΘL8 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is inte-
grable on R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) × Tǫ0 for all σ.
(8) Consider L9 .
   Let
                     I = I0 \ {(1, j, k) for 1 ≤ k < j ≤ 4, (1, 5, 1)}.

Then by Lemma (3.7),
                                                      17      2           1 20    15
                  hI (λ, t) ≪ sup(1, λ−23 )tw((( 3 ,8− 3 ,6,8− 3 , 3 ), 2 )) ,
                                                            4         2      1 5       13
                  hI (λ, t)t−2ρ ≪ sup(1, λ−23 )tw((( 3 ,− 3 ,−3,− 3 , 3 ), 2 )) .

   For 1 ≤ β < α ≤ 4, we define L9,αβ = {x ∈ L9 | x2,αβ 6= 0}. Then by Proposition
(3.14)(5), L9 = ∪α,β L9,αβ . Since t−γ2,αβ ≪ t−γ2,43 for all α, β as above, by Lemma
(1.2.6) [8], for any N ≥ 1,
                                                                  2               13
    ΘL9,αβ (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ ≪ sup(1, λ−21 )λ−3N tw(((0,− 3 ,−3,−1,1), 2 )−N(2d1,51 −d2,43 )) .

  It is easy to see that
                                                                
                                                               1
                           2d1,51 + d2,43   = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1),     .
                                                               2

So all the entries of
                                            
                       4 2          1 5     13

                                                             

                          3        3        3 3             2

are negative if N ≫ 0.
    Therefore, λσ ΘL9 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) ×
  0
Tǫ for all σ.
(9) Consider L10 .
   For 1 ≤ β < α ≤ 4, we define L10,αβ = {x ∈ L10 | x2,αβ 6= 0}. Then by
Proposition (3.14)(5), L10 = ∪α,β L10,αβ . Since t−γ2,αβ ≪ t−γ2,43 for all α, β as
above, we only consider the case (α, β) = (4, 3).
   Let I ′ = {(1, 5, 2), (1, 6, 2), (2, 4, 3)}, and

                        V ′ = {x ∈ V | xi,jk = 0 for (i, j, k) ∈
                                                               / I ′ }.

For Ψ′ ∈ S (VA′ ), we define
                                                  X
                         Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt) =                               Ψ′ (λtx).
                                                  x∈V ′
                                                       k
                                          x1,52 ,x1,61 ,x2,αβ 6=0



                                                22
Then as before, there exists 0 ≤ Ψ′ ∈ S (VA′ ) such that

                                                                              l

                  ΘL10,43 (Ψ, λt)t   −2ρ
                                           ≪ sup(1, λ  −27     ′    ′

                                                                              h=1


      By Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any N1 , N2 , N3 ≥ 1,

       Θ′ (Ψ′ , λt)tw(qh ) ≪ sup(1, λ−27 )λ−N1 −N2 −N3 tw(qh −N1 d1,61 −N2 d1,52 −N3 d2,43 ) .

      It is easy to see that
                                                                      
                                                                     1
                          d1,61 + d1,52 + d2,43   = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0),     .
                                                                     2

  Therefore, by the same argument as in (4), λσ ΘL10 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on
R+ × Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) × Tǫ0 for all σ.
(10) Consider L11 .
   For α = 2, 3, 4, we define L11,α = {x ∈ L11 | x2,α1 6= 0}. Then by Proposition
(3.14)(6), L11 = ∪α L11,α . Since t−γ2,α1 ≪ t−γ2,41 for α = 2, 3, 4, we only consider
the case α = 4.
   It is easy to see that
                                                                               

So by Lemma (1.2.6) [8], for any N ≥ 1,

      Therefore, λσ ΘL11 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ ×Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) ×
Tǫ0   for all σ.
(11) Consider L12 .
   For α = 2, 3, 4, β = 1, 2, α > β, we define L12,αβ = {x ∈ L12 | x2,αβ 6= 0}. Then
by Proposition (3.14)(7), L12 = ∪α,β L12,αβ . Since t−γ2,αβ ≪ t−γ2,42 for all α, β as

Then by the same argument as in (2), we only have to consider functions of the

where N1 ≥ 1, N2 , N3 ≥ 0.
   It is easy to see that we can choose N1 , N2 , N3 so that all the entries of ph −
N1 m1 − N2 m2 − N3 m3 are negative.
   Therefore, λσ ΘL12 (Ψ, λt)t−2ρ is integrable on R+ ×Tǫ0 for σ ≫ 0 and on [1, ∞) ×
