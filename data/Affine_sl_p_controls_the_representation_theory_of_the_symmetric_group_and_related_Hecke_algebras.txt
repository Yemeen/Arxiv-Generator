                                                         The paper is self-contained, and our techniques are elementary (no perverse
                                                     sheaves or algebraic geometry is invoked).




                                                                                  1. Introduction
                                                 This paper is concerned with the representation theory of the affine Hecke algebra
                                             of type A and of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras.
                                                 We parameterise the finite dimensional representations of these algebras over any
                                             field R and prove various results about the behaviour of irreducible modules under
                                             restriction and induction. Each of these algebras contains a large commutative
                                             subalgebra, and we also describe how the failure of this algebra to act semisimply
                                             controls the combinatorics of the representation theory.
                                                 In contrast to the existing literature on these algebras, we prove all our re-
                                             sults without the use of sophisticated machinery or explicit combinatorics—perverse
                                             sheaves and the geometry of the graded nilpotent cones are notably absent from
                                             this work, as is the study of partitions.
                                                 In their place we prove the following theorem, which is a remarkable rigidity
                                             property of the representation theory: there is an action of the characteristic zero
                                                                 b ℓ on the Grothendieck group of Hecke algebra representations.

                                             Furthermore, the irreducible Hecke representations define the natural crystal struc-

                                                 As an immediate consequence we recover the explicit combinatorics of the Hecke
                                             algebra representation theory. For example, the simplest case of these theorems
                                             identifies the Grothendieck group of symmetric group representations in character-
                                                                                                           b p . This representation
                                             istic p with an integral form of the basic representation of sl
                                             has a construction as a Fock space (the “principal realisation”). The well known
                                             natural parametrisation by p-regular partitions of the irreducible characteristic p
                                             representations of the symmetric group follows immediately. In particular, this
                                                                                             1

explains why the generating function for the number of irreducible mod-p represen-
tations of Sn is just the character of the basic representation of sl       b p.
   To describe the results in more detail, consider the direct sum over all n of the
Grothendieck group of representations of the affine Hecke algebra of type An . (This,
and all other terms, are carefully defined in the body of the paper).
   Similarly, consider the direct sum over all n of the Grothendieck group of repre-
sentations of the symmetric group Sn . Then it is a classical observation that these
are cocommutative Hopf algebras; for the symmetric group this has been rediscov-
ered many times (see [Mc]), but for the affine Hecke algebra this is due to [BZ]. In
theorem 14.1 we identify this algebra—it is just the dual to the enveloping algebra
U ηℓ of the upper triangular part of the affine algebra sl    b ℓ ; here l is the order of the
                   ×
parameter q ∈ R which enters in the definition of the affine Hecke algebra.
   More generally, consider the cyclotomic Hecke algebra defined by Ariki and Koike
[AK]. This is a deformation of the group algebra of the wreath product of the
symmetric group Sn with a cyclic group of order r. The deformation depends on
an r-tuple of elements of R× , λ = (q1 , . . . , qr ), and we denote the corresponding
algebra Hnλ . When r = 1 and λ = (1) this is just the finite Hecke algebra.
   If we now sum the Grothendieck groups of representations of Hnλ for fixed λ it
is no longer true that this is a Hopf algebra. However it is obviously a comodule
for the Hopf algebra (dual to U ηℓ ) built out of the affine Hecke algebra. The first
of our main theorems, theorem 14.2, says that it has many more symmetries—that
it is in fact dual to a module for the entire affine algebra sl      b ℓ , and moreover that
this module is an irreducible integrable highest weight module with highest weight
determined by λ.
   Even in the classical case of the symmetric group and its deformations (r = 1)
this is new information: it identifies the Hopf algebra built out of Sn with the
principal realisation of the basic representation of sl b ℓ , and it identifies the action of
b
slℓ by vertex operators on this representation. For other cyclotomic Hecke algebras
it extends the results of [A].
   To prove this theorem we must introduce several new ingredients. The first is
the action of the Chevalley generators fi of the lower triangular part ηℓ− of sl            b ℓ.
Unlike the operators ei of ηℓ which have been known since the 1950s, and which
arise in an obvious way from the affine Hecke algebra, the definition of the fi is new
to this paper. After a variety of preliminary results on the affine Hecke algebra, we
begin the study of these operators in section 8.
   The operators ei and fi are defined directly on the module category, but will
                                       b ℓ before we pass to the Grothendieck group.
not satisfy the defining relations of sl
However, by considering the cosocle filtration of these operators (i.e. before passing
to the Grothendieck group), we can define the leading term of the operators ei
and fi . These leading terms have a beautiful interpretation as “crystal operators”
[Ka], and allow us to define the crystal graph structure of the representations.
This structure generalises the classical “branching laws” for representations of the
symmetric group.
   The crystal graph is a graph with nodes given by irreducible representations,
and with an edge between irreducible representation M of Hnλ and N of Hn−1           λ
                                                                                          if N
                                                                          ∗
occurs in the cosocle of the restriction of M . The operators ei which are dual to
ei refine restriction, and we can label this edge with an i if N occurs in e∗i M .

    Our second main theorem (theorem 14.3) is that this graph is precisely the usual
crystal graph of the representation determined by λ. This gives a combinatorial
parametrisation of irreducible representations, and shows this parametrisation de-
pends only on l—the order of q in R× . (When R = C the modules for Hnaff were
first parameterised in [BZ] when l = ∞, and in [G] for arbitrary l. Subsequently
Vigneras conjectured [V] that the parametrisation depends only on l, and not on
R.)
    To prove this we must engage in a detailed study of the modules for the affine
Hecke algebra. We begin by showing that e∗i M has a simple cosocle. This result,
which is the main result of [GV], generalises the classical “multiplicity one” prop-
erties of restriction for complex representations of the symmetric group, and the
corresponding property for characteristic p representations [Kv].
    We then study the relationship between the crystal operators and the failure of
semisimplicity of both the Hecke algebra and a large commutative subalgebra of
it (the functions R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ] on the maximal torus of GLn ). We find that
though e∗i M is a complicated module which is far from being semisimple, it has a
uniserial part to its composition series which admits a clean description in various
ways.
    In particular, the cosocle of e∗i M occurs in a uniserial chain inside e∗i M , and
the length of the chain in which it occurs is precisely the maximal size of a Jordan
block for Xn on M . We prove that this length can also be read off the image of M
inside the Grothendieck group of R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ]-modules.
    These results, and the analogous (but harder) results for induction, form the
bulk of section 9.
    Finally, we can reinterpret the theorems 14.3, 14.2 as defining a family of in-
teresting bases in the representations of sl    b ℓ . Each of these bases has the same
crystal graph, but these p-canonical bases are all different. In the case R = C,
the 0-canonical basis coincides with the basis defined by Lusztig and Kashiwara.
Each p-canonical basis shares all of the remarkable properties of the 0-canonical
basis—for example, the structure constants of ei and fi are non-negative integers,
and the basis of the Verma descends to a basis of the integrable representations.
These bases are just the dual to the irreducible representations, and p is the charac-
teristic of the field R. (The dual to the p-canonical basis also has a Hecke theoretic
interpretation—they are dual to the projective representations).
    To summarise, this paper “explains” all of the combinatorics of the representa-
tion theory of the symmetric group and Hecke algebras—it is just the combinatorics
of the crystal graph of slb ℓ . (Our proofs are free of such combinatorics.)

1.1. Acknowledgement. I would like to thank Monica Vazirani for her aid in
preparing this paper. Her many suggestions have improved both the mathematics
and exposition, and our collaboration on [GV] has greatly increased my under-
standing of Hecke algebras and their representation theory.

                                     2. Notation
   Throughout the paper, we fix a field R, and an invertible element q ∈ R, i.e., a
homomorphism Z[q, q −1 ] → R. We write µq = {q i | i ∈ Z} for the powers of q in
R, and ℓ = |µq |, so ℓ ∈ N ∪ {∞}, and ℓ is the order of q ∈ R× .
   We further assume that q 6= 1. This is for clarity of exposition; the changes in the
statements of definitions and theorems that must be made when q = 1 are sketched

in section 15. The most interesting case when q = 1 is the modular representation
theory of the symmetric group. Then R = Fp and q = 1, but ℓ = p; see section 15.
    Define the Dynkin diagram of µq to be the directed graph with vertices the
elements of µq , and an edge q i → q j if q i−j−1 = 1. (A slightly classier notation,
which we often use, is to write i, j ∈ µq instead of q i , q j ∈ µq , and then i → j if
ij −1 = q.) The isomorphism type of this graph depends only on ℓ, and not on more
general properties of q or R. This feature will be mirrored by the properties of
the representation theory we study. (Conjecturally [DJ] the representation theory
depends only on the characteristic of R and the Dynkin diagram µq .)
    The Dynkin diagram of µq defines an affine Lie algebra sl  b ℓ . The theorems of this
paper are a description of how this Lie algebra controls the representation theory
of the affine and cyclotomic Hecke algebras. We recall the definition and basic
               b ℓ and its representation theory (as found in [Kac]) in section 3.
properties of sl
    Most of the results about Hecke algebras hold for arbitrary rings R when ap-
propriately formulated. This is an easy exercise, but for clarity we have phrased
results only for fields.

2.1. Some common notation. If A is an R-algebra, we write A-mod for the
category of all left A-modules, and Rep A for the category of left A-modules which
are finite dimensional as R-modules. Also write Proj A for the subcategory of Rep A
consisting of finite dimensional projective A-modules. (If R is an arbitrary ring, we
would also need to define various subcategories, such as the category of A-modules
which are projective as R-modules, and so on.)
   We recall that the socle of a module M , denoted soc(M ), is the largest semisimple
submodule of M , and that the cosocle of M , denoted cosoc(M ), is its largest
semisimple quotient.
   We write Sn for the symmetric group on n letters, si = (i i + 1) for the simple
transpositions, ℓ:Sn → N for the length function.

2.2. Grothendieck Group. If C is an abelian category, we write K(C) for the
Grothendieck group of C. This is the quotient of the free abelian group with gen-
erators the objects M ∈ C by the ideal generated by the elements M1 − M2 + M3
for every short exact sequence
                              0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → 0
in C. If objects in C have finite length and unique composition factors, we write
K(C)∗ for the topological dual of K(C); i.e. for the linear functions f :K(C) → Z
such that f (M ) = 0 for all but finitely many isomorphism classes of irreducible
objects M ∈ C.
   If M ∈ C, let’s write [M ] for its image in K(C). Then as M runs through the
irreducible objects in C, the elements [M ] form a basis of K(C), and the functions
                                          (
                                            0 if M 6≃ N, N irreducible
            δM :K(C) → Z        δM (N ) =
                                            1 if M ≃ N

form a basis of K(C)∗ . More generally, if N ∈ C and M is an irreducible object in C,
write [M : N ] for the multiplicity of M in a Jordan-Holder series of N , and extend
this to [ : ]:K(C) × K(C) → Z by bilinearity. Then write, for any M ∈ K(C),
δM :K(C) → Z for the function N 7→ [M : N ].

   Now, if F :C → C′ is an exact functor of abelian categories, we get an induced Z-
linear map F :K(C) → K(C′ ), and we can define its transpose F ∗ :K(C′ )∗ → K(C)∗
by F ∗ f = f F .
   We will apply all this to the category Rep A of finite dimensional representations
of an algebra A (over R). Suppose that A and A′ are two such algebras, and that
the cosocle of A and A′ are direct sums of matrix algebras over R; i.e. that they are
separable algebras. Then the the irreducible representations of A ⊗ A′ are of the
form M ⊠M ′ , where M is an irreducible A-module, M ′ is an irreducible A′ -module.
More generally, we recall that under such assumptions
Lemma 2.1. K(A ⊗ A′ -mod) = K(A-mod) ⊗ K(A′ -mod)
which is certainly not true before passing to the Grothendieck group. (Here, the
tensor product is algebraic—elements consist of finite linear combinations of the
elements [M ] ⊠ [N ] as [M ], [N ] run through a basis of K(A-mod) and K(A′ -mod)
respectively.)
   Write K(C)Q = K(C) ⊗Z Q. As K(C) is a torsion free Z-module, K(C)Q is a
Q-vector space with distinguished sublattice K(C) ⊂ K(C)Q .

          3. Summary of properties of the affine Lie algebra sl
   First suppose ℓ ∈ N. If A is a ring, we write slℓ (A) for the Lie algebra of trace
zero ℓ × ℓ matrices over A and slb ℓ (A) for the central extension of slℓ (A[t, t−1 ]) by
A
                      0 → A · c → slb ℓ (A) → slℓ (A[t, t−1 ]) → 0.
This has Lie bracket [f, g] = (f g − gf ) + tr Res( df
                                                     dt · g)c, where f, g ∈ sl ℓ (A[t, t
                                                                                         −1
                                                                                            ])
                                      −1
and Res denotes the coefficient of t .
   If ℓ = ∞, lets abuse notation and write sl b ℓ (A) for the Lie algebra
                                                gl∞ (A)
of infinite matrices in which only finitely many entries in any row or column are
non-zero. With this convention, the rest of this section is valid for ℓ ∈ N ∪ {∞}.
             b ℓ for the enveloping algebra of sl
   Write UQ sl                                 b ℓ (Q). This has generators
                                      e i , f i , hi     i ∈ µq

  Write UZ slℓ for Kostant’s integral form of UQ slℓ . This is a Hopf algebra over Z,

the relations explicitly; but we will not need this.)
   We write UZ ηℓ for the Hopf subalgebra of UZ sl b ℓ generated by e(n) , i ∈ µq , n ∈ N ,
                                                                       i

and UZ ηℓ for the Hopf subalgebra of UZ sl b ℓ generated by f (n) , i ∈ µq , n ∈ N .

   Recall that a representation V of UQ slb ℓ is called integrable of lowest weight if
6                                        I. Grojnowski


   (i) Each hi acts semisimply
  (ii) Each ei and fi acts locally nilpotently
 (iii) There exists a finite dimensional subspace W ⊆ V such that UQ ηℓ · W = V
and that the category of such representations is semisimple.
    Given an integrable lowest weight module V , the space of invariants for UZ ηℓ−
(lowest weight vectors) is preserved by each hi . If this space is one dimensional V is
irreducible,
      P      and if 1λ is a lowest weight vector with hi 1λ = λi · 1λ ∀i, then λi ∈ N
and      λi < ∞.
    This sets up a correspondence between
                           X                                                    
                                                         irreducible integrable
     (functions λ:µq → N,      λi < ∞)      and
                                                         lowest weight modules.
Given λ, write Lλ for the corresponding irreducible module.
  As a UQ ηℓ -module, Lλ is generated by a lowest weight vector 1λ , and
                           Lλ = UQ ηℓ / UQ ηℓ heλi i +1 | i ∈ µq i.
                                                          T
In particular, as the intersection of the left ideals λ:µq →N UQ ηℓ heλi i +1 | i ∈ µq i is
trivial, it follows that if x ∈ UQ ηℓ acts as zero on every integrable lowest weight
representation, then x = 0.
   We write Λ0 :µq → N for the function Λ0 (i) = δi,1 . The corresponding rep-
resentation is called the basic representation of sl      b ℓ . More generally, define the
fundamental weights Λj : µq → N by Λj (i) = δi,j and define the roots αi : µq → Z
by αi = 2Λi − Λqi − Λq−1 i .
   Each Lλ carries a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, the Shapovalov form
( , ), which is determined by requiring
                                         (1λ , 1λ ) = 1
and
                           (ei x, y) = (x, fi y)      for all i ∈ µq .

          4. Definitions and first properties of Hecke algebras
4.1.   The finite Hecke algebra, Hn is the R-algebra with generators
                                        T1 , . . . , Tn−1
and relations
(1)      braid relations      Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 ,    Ti Tj = Tj Ti , |i − j| > 1
(2) quadratic relations                        (Ti + 1)(Ti − q) = 0.
  The braid relations imply that if w = si1 · · · sir and ℓ(w) = r, then Ti1 · · · Tir
depends only on w ∈ Sn . It is denoted Tw , and the Tw , w ∈ Sn form a basis of Hn
over R.
  The affine Hecke algebra Hnaff is the R-algebra, which as an R-module is isomor-
phic to
                            Hn ⊗R R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ].
The algebra structure is given by requiring that Hn and R[Xi±1 ] are subalgebras,
and that
(3)                                   Ti Xi Ti = qXi+1 .
                               Representations of Hecke algebras                             7


Equivalently, if f ∈ R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ], then
                                                        f − sif
(4)                         Ti f − sif Ti = (q − 1)            −1
                                                      1 − Xi Xi+1
where si ∈ Sn acts on R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ] by permuting Xi and Xi+1 .
    The affine Hecke algebra so defined is an extension by a Laurent polynomial
algebra of the Hecke algebra associated to the Coxeter group with Dynkin diagram
µq . This definition and the isomorphism is due to Bernstein.
Proposition 4.1. (Bernstein) The center of Hnaff , Z(Hnaff ), is isomorphic to sym-
metric Laurent polynomials.
                             Z(Hnaff ) ≃ R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ]Sn


Proof. The relation (4) makes it P    clear that R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ]Sn is contained in the
center. Conversely, suppose h = Tw fw ∈ Z(Hnaff ) where fw ∈ R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ].
Let u ∈ Sn be maximal with respect to Bruhat order such that fu P               6= 0. If u 6= 1
then there exists some i such that u(i) 6= i. As Xi Tw = Tw Xw−1 (i) + w′ <w Tw′ gw′
for some gw′ ∈ R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ], the coefficient of Tu is different in Xi h and hXi .
Hence h = f1 ∈ R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ]. But then (4) implies h is Sn -invariant.

Corollary 4.2. If M ∈ Hnaff -mod is absolutely irreducible, then M is finite dimen-
sional, and in fact dimR M ≤ n!.
Proof. As R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ] is a free R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ]Sn -module of rank n!, Hnaff
is a free module over Z(Hnaff ) of rank (n!)2 . Dixmier’s version of Schur’s lemma
implies that the center of Hnaff acts by scalars on absolutely irreducible modules,
and hence M is an irreducible module for a finite dimensional algebra of dimension
(n!)2 .

Suppose R is algebraically closed. Then the characters (i.e. one dimensional repre-
sentations) of the center Z(Hnaff ) are the orbits of Sn on (R× )n = SpecR[X1±1 , . . . ,
Xn±1 ]. Given any finite dimensional module M ∈ Rep Hnaff , we can write M as a di-
rect sum of generalized eigenspaces for the commutative subalgebra R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ],
say
                                          M
                                   M=            M [s]
                                           s∈(R× )n

where s = (s1 , . . . , sn ) and M [s] = {m ∈ M | (Xi − si )dim M m = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.
  If we also write
                        Ms = {m ∈ M | Xi m = si m, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
for the actual simultaneous eigenspace of the elements Xi , we have
                                 Ms 6= 0 ⇐⇒ M [s] 6= 0.
Further, if M is irreducible, then Z(Hnaff ) acts by the central character Sn · s ∈
(R× )n /Sn if and only if there exists some w ∈ Sn such that Mws 6= 0.
   To generalize this to all of Rep Hnaff , recall the following general property of
algebras.
8                                     I. Grojnowski


Lemma 4.3. Let A be an R-algebra, and Z ⊂ A a central subalgebra. If M, N are
two A-modules on which Z acts by different one dimensional characters, then
                           ExtiA (M, N ) = 0,          for all i.


   Now, let M be an indecomposable finite dimensional Hnaff -module. This has a
finite filtration by irreducible Hnaff -modules, and the lemma implies Z(Hnaff ) acts
by the same character on each subquotient. It follows that
                                  L
Proposition 4.4. Rep Hnaff ≃ s∈(R× )n /Sn Reps Hnaff (direct sum of categories).
A module M is in Reps Hnaff if and only if the support of M as a Z(Hnaff )-module
is s ∈ (R× )n /Sn , i.e. if and only if (i) there exists an s′ ∈ (R× )n with Ms′ 6= 0,
and Sn · s′ = s, and (ii) if Ms′ 6= 0, then Sn · s′ = s.
   The summands above are called blocks of the category Rep Hnaff . If s ∈ (R× )n ,
                                                               ±1
Reps Hnaff = −  lim        aff     k aff
                 → k Rep(Hn /Zs Hn ), where Zs = {f ∈ R[X1 , . . . , Xn ]

                                                                                  |
                          aff

4.2. Fix a function λ:µq → Z+ such that i≥0 λi = r < ∞.
   The Ariki-Koike algebra, or cyclotomic Hecke algebra, is the R-algebra with
generators
                           T1 , . . . , Tn−1  and  T0
and relations                     Y
                                          (T0 − q i )λi = 0

                                T0 T1 T0 T1 = T1 T0 T1 T0
as well as the braid relations (1) and quadratic relations (2) in the definition of the
finite Hecke algebra above for i ≥ 1.
    In particular, if r = 1 then this is just the finite Hecke algebra, and if r = 2 this
is the Hecke algebra of type Bn or Cn with possibly unequal parameters. The finite
Hecke algebra is always a subalgebra of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra.
    There is a surjective algebra homomorphism, first defined by Cherednik
                                 ev = evλ :Hnaff → Hnλ
defined on the generators by Ti 7→ Ti ,          1≤i≤n−1
                  X1 7→ T0 ,      Xi 7→ q 1−i Ti−1 · · · T1 T0 T1 · · · Ti−1
Write ev∗ : Rep Hnλ → Rep Hnaff for the induced map of modules.
   The image ev(R[X1±1 , . . . , Xn±1 ]) form a commutative subalgebra of Hnλ , (“Mur-
phy operators”) and as ev is surjective, the image ev(Z(Hnaff )) is contained in the
center of Hnλ . This implies the category of Hnλ -modules splits up into a direct sum,
indexed by characters of Z(Hnaff ),
                                             M
                                 Rep Hnλ =       Reps Hnλ .
The key result about these algebras is:
Proposition 4.5 (Ariki-Koike).
                    P          The algebra Hnλ is finite dimensional, of dimen-
      n
sion r n!, where r = i∈µq λi .

  The image under ev of the elements
                       X1a1 · · · Xnan Tw ,       0 ≤ ai < r, w ∈ Sn
form a basis of Hnλ .
   Consider the modules M for Hnaff such that the only eigenvalues of X1 on M are
powers of q. Such modules form a full subcategory of Rep Hnaff which we denote
Repq Hnaff .
   If 0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → 0 is exact in Rep Hnaff , and any two of the modules
Mi are in Repq Hnaff , then so is the third, i.e. Repq Hnaff is closed under subquotients
and extensions.
   Further, Repq Hnaff is a direct sum of blocks of the category Rep Hnaff ; i.e.

Lemma 4.6. If M ∈ Repq Hnaff , and N ∈ Rep Hnaff with Ext• (M, N ) 6= 0 or
Ext• (N, M ) 6= 0, then N ∈ Repq Hnaff also. More precisely,
                                          M
                          Repq Hnaff =         Reps Hnaff .
                                              s∈µq n /Sn

   This is immediate from the following lemma, and the above description of the
center of Hnaff .
Lemma 4.7. If M is a module for Hnaff and there is some i such that the only
eigenvalues for Xi on M are powers of q, then for all j, the only eigenvalues of Xj
on M are powers of q.
Proof. Write X = Xi−1 , T = Ti−1 . Let v be an eigenvector for X and for T XT =
qXi . It is enough to show that the eigenvalues of X and T XT on v differ by a
power of q. Consider the space spanned by v and T v. This is X-stable.If it is two 

dimensional, then with respect to the basis v, T v we have T has matrix

and X has matrix              . It follows that T XT  has matrix
                       0 µ′                                        δ qµ + (q − 1)δ
where δ = a + µ (q − 1). By assumption, δ = 0, so T XT has eigenvalues qµ, qµ′
                   ′

and we are done. If T v is a multiple of v, then either T v = −v or T v = qv. In the
first case T XT has eigenvalue µ, in the second case q 2 µ, and we’re done.
                         P
    Given λ:µq → Z+ ,       λi < ∞, it is immediate from the definition of Hnλ that
if M ∈ Rep Hn , ev M ∈ Repq Hnaff . Define Repλq Hnaff to be the full subcategory
               λ       ∗

of Rep Hnaff whose objects are the modules M such that the Jordan blocks of X1
on M with eigenvalue q i have size less than or equal to λi (and there are no other
                                                                   Q
eigenvalues), i.e. Repλq Hnaff consists of modules annihilated by (X1 − q i )λi .
    Then if M ∈ Repλq Hnaff , and N is a subquotient of M , then N ∈ Repλq Hnaff also.
However, extensions of modules in Repλq need not be in Repλq .
    We clearly have
                                ev∗ : Rep Hnλ → Repλq Hnaff
is an equivalence of categories.
   Given any M ∈ Repq Hnaff , there are infinitely many λ such that M ∈ Repλq Hnaff .
More precisely, define a partial order on λ by λ ≥ µ if λi ≥ µi for all i. Then

   The exact functor ev∗ = ev∗λ : Rep Hnλ → Rep Hnaff has a left adjoint prλ , and a
right adjoint pr
              ˇ λ . To define them, write
                                Iλ = ker(ev:Hnaff → Hnλ ).
As ev is an algebra homomorphism, Iλ is a two sided ideal, and as ev is surjective

                               Hnλ = Hnaff Iλ .
Now if N ∈ Rep Hnaff , we have N / Iλ N is an Hnaff -module on which Iλ acts trivially
and so N / Iλ N is an Hnλ -module. If M ∈ Rep Hnλ we have
       HomHnλ ( N / Iλ N, M ) = HomHnaff ( N / Iλ N, ev∗ M ) = HomHnaff (N, ev∗ M )
and so if we define

We will investigate some rigid structures on these categories.

                5. Generalities on Induction and Restriction
   The results in this section are easy and are mostly well known (with the possible
exception of 5.6). We omit proofs which are trivial variants of what is already in
the literature.
5.1.   Recall that if A ⊂ B are R-algebras, the exact functor of restriction
                                    ResB
                                       A :B-mod → A-mod
                                     d defined by
has left and right adjoints, Ind and Ind
                       IndB
                          A :A-mod → B-mod                 M 7→ B ⊗A M
                       B
                    d :A-mod
                    Ind        → B-mod                M 7→ HomA (B, M );
                       A
i.e. we have the Frobenius reciprocity
HomB (IndB                                                     d ) = HomA (Res N, M ).
         A M, N ) = HomA (M, Res N )                  HomB (N, IndM
                                      d are exact functors also. Further, if
If B is a free A-module, then Ind and Ind
A ⊂ B ⊂ C are inclusions of R-algebras, we have transitivity of induction and
restriction:
                                                                       C     B   C

                                                                            d

Now apply these remarks to affine and cyclotomic Hecke algebras. Given a sequence
P = (a1 , . . . , ak ) of non-negative integers, we have an obvious embedding
                              Haaff
                                 1

                                                 k
                                                    ֒→ Haaff
                                                          1 +···+ak

which makes Haaff      1 +···+ak
                                   a free Haaff 1
                                                  ⊗ · · · ⊗ Haaff

remarks we get exact functors Res, Ind, Ind. These functors depend on the order
(a1 , . . . , ak ) and not just on the underlying set!

    Similarly, we may define induction and restriction for finite Hecke algebras,
i.e. functors

related. The results of section 9.2 describe the relation.
5.2. Mackey formula. We now state the Mackey formula. Unfortunately, it re-
quires some notation.                                                              P
   Given a sequence P = (a1 , . . . , ak ) of positive integers, as above, with       ai = n,
write HPaff = Haaff1
                     ⊗ · · · ⊗ Haaff
                                  k
                                     ֒→ Hnaff , SP = Sa1 × · · · × Sak ֒→ Sn , and HP =
Ha1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Hak . Then if P ′ is another such sequence, we define a partial order on
SP \Sn / SP ′ by setting x ≤ y if the maximal length coset representative of x is less
than that of y in Bruhat order.
   Now if x is a minimal length coset representative of an element x ∈ SP \Sn / SP ′ ,
write P ∩ xP ′ for the new sequence of positive integers defined by listing the parts
of the ordered partition of 1, . . . , n defined by P ∩ xP ′ . Note HPaff∩xP ′ is isomorphic
to HPaff′ ∩x−1P by the isomorphism “conjugation by x” which sends
                             Tw 7→ Txwx−1               Xi 7→ Xx−1 (i) .

Theorem 5.6.         (i) If ∆q (s) 6= 0, induction defines an equivalence of categories

 (ii) If ∆(s) 6= 0, there is an equivalence of categories
                                       g
                                  Reps H

(iii) Regardless, there is always an isomorphism
                                   g
                            K(Reps H aff ∼

   In particular, if M is an irreducible Hnaff -module with central character Sn · s,
                                                                        g
then by defining that S acts via evaluation at s, we get an irreducible H aff
                                                                          n -module,
                                                   g aff
and conversely every irreducible module in Reps Hn is of such a form.
   The following particular case will be of great importance to us.

ducible. It is the unique irreducible Hnaff -module with central character (q i · · · q i ).
  Notice that the theorem tells us completely how to reconstruct all of Rep Hnaff
once we understand Repq Hnaff . (This is one good reason for concentrating on
Repq Hnaff for the rest of the paper!)

   The preceding proposition, when combined with the following useful observation,
allows us to detect whether certain induced modules are irreducible.
Lemma 5.9. If Ind(M ⊠ N ) ≃ Ind(Md       ⊠ N ), and M ⊠ N is an irreducible module
which occurs with multiplicity one in a composition series for Res Ind(M ⊠N ), then
Ind(M ⊠ N ) is irreducible.
Proof. Let 0 → K → Ind(M ⊠ N ) → Q → 0 be an exact sequence. Then M ⊠ N
is a submodule of Q, if Q 6= 0, by Frobenius reciprocity, and as Ind(M ⊠ N ) ≃
d
Ind(M  ⊠ N ), M ⊠ N is also a submodule of K if K 6= 0. As M ⊠ N occurs with
multiplicity one, either K or Q is zero, and so Ind(M ⊠ N ) is irreducible.

                                        6. Examples
   The computations in this section will be used in sections 10 and 12.

6.1. H1aff . Recall H1aff = R[x, x−1 ].
   For q i ∈ µq , and n ≥ 1, let’s write q i Jn for the rank n Jordan block with
eigenvalue q i , i.e.
                               q i Jn := R[x]/(x − q i )n .
This is an indecomposable H1aff -module, and conversely every indecomposable mod-
ule in Repq H1aff is of the form q i Jn for a unique q i ∈ µq and n ≥ 1. Further
                                                     (
                 i      j            1 i      j          0          if q i 6= q j
          Hom(q Jn , q Jn′ ) = Ext (q Jn , q Jn′ ) =             ′
                                                         Rmin(n,n ) if q i = q j
14                                           I. Grojnowski


and
                             Extk (q i Jn , q j Jn′ ) = 0    if k 6= 0, 1.
Hence   Repq H1affis the direct sum of µq -copies of the same category, the category
of finite Jordan blocks (with a fixed eigenvalue).

6.2. H2aff -modules. We list all the indecomposable H2aff -modules. First, an easy
computation. Write S = R[X1±1 , X2±1 ].
Lemma 6.1. Set p = (1 − X1 X2−1 )T1 − (q − 1). Then
  (i) X1 p = pX2 , X2 p = pX1
 (ii) p2 = (q − X1 X2−1 )(q − X2 X1−1 ) is central.
   We describe Reps1 ,s2 H2aff . Choose s = (s1 , s2 ) in the orbit {(s1 , s2 ), (s2 , s1 )},
and write s′ = (s2 , s1 ). Let M be a module, and write M = Ms + Ms′ for its
decomposition into generalized eigenspaces for S.
   Clearly pMs ⊆ Ms′ and pMs′ ⊆ Ms by (6.1).
Case 1. s1 6= s2 , and s1 s−1
                           2 6= q
                                  ±1
                                     .
       2
Then p is an invertible semisimple automorphism, and M = Ms ⊕ pMs . We have
inverse equivalences of categories
                Reps S ⇄ Reps H2aff ,             A 7→ H2aff ⊗S A,      Ms ← M.
Case 2. s2 = qs1 . (q 6= 1)
In this case, p2 is nilpotent, and 1−X1 X2−1 is invertible. Now, ker p is S-stable, and
                   q−1
on ker p, T1 is 1−X   X −1
                           . It follows that ker p is an H2aff -submodule, and that ker p =
                     1   2
(ker p)s ⊕(ker p)s′ is a decomposition as H2aff -modules. Further, the indecomposable
summands of ker p as an H2fin -module are the indecomposable summands as an H2aff -
module. First suppose q 6= −1. Then T1 acts semisimply on ker p, hence so does
X1 X2−1 . We suppose for simplicity that the central element X1 X2 acts semisimply.
Then ker p is a direct sum of one dimensional H2aff -modules. On the subspace on
which T1 acts as −1, we have X1 = qX2 ; on the subspace on which T1 acts as q, we
have X2 = qX1 . Now suppose q = −1. Then (T1 + 1)2 = 0 = (1 − X1 X2−1 )2 , and
                                                                  fin
again there are two    isomorphism
                                  classes of indecomposable H2 -modules: namely
                           -1 1
T1 acts as −1 or as               .
                            0 -1
   Let A ∈ Rep(s1 ,qs1 ) , and set A′ ∈ Rep(qs1 ,s1 ) to be (X1 ↔ X2 )∗ A. Put A+ =
Im(IndA → IndA′ ) = pIndA, A− = Im(IndA′ → IndA) = pIndA′ , and A0 =
IndA. Then if A is indecomposable, so are A0 , A+ , A− ; and if q = −1 these
give a complete list of (non-isomorphic) indecomposables. For all q, the modules
(J1 ⊠ qJ1 )+ and (J1 ⊠ qJ1 )− are the distinct irreducibles.
Case 3. s = (s1 , s1 ).
We have nothing general to add to the description of these modules already given
by theorem 5.6; however we record the following, which is proved by direct compu-
tation.

6.3.  H3aff .We list the number of the irreducible H3aff -modules for which (si −

Reps′ Hnaff , where s′ = (αs1 , . . . , αsn ) for some α ∈ R× , we may assume s1 = 1.

q = −1:
Rep(1,1,q) : There are 3 irreducible modules with central character (11q); two are

(1q1).
q 3 = 1:

The modules in Rep(1,1,q) have characters 2(11q) + (1q1) and 2(q11) + (1q1).
q 2 6= 1, q 3 6= 1:
There are 4 irreducible modules in Rep(1,q,q2 ) , 2 in Rep(1,1,q) , 2 in Rep(1,q,q) .

Rep(1,q,a) : there are 2 in Rep(1,q,a) , where a ∈
(a1q) + (1aq) + (1qa) and Ind((q1) ⊠ a) = (aq1) + (qa1) + (q1a) are irreducible.
Except for Rep(1,q,q2 ) these modules have the same character as when q 3 = 1.
6.4. H4aff when q = −1. .
 Rep(1,1,1,q) has three irreducibles: 6(111q) + 2(11q1) = Ind2(11q) ⊠ 1, 2(11q1) +
2(1q11) = Ind(1q1) ⊠ 1, and 6(q111) + 2(1q11) = Ind2(q11) ⊠ 1.
   Rep(1,1,q,q) has six irreducibles, four of dimension 2 and two of dimension 1:
2(11qq), 2(qq11), 2(1qq1), 2(q11q), (1q1q), and (q1q1).

                    7. Bernstein-MacDonald Hopf algebra

                               L                                                H aff
and comultiplication ∆M =         a1 +a2 =n   ∆a1 ,a2 M , where ∆a1 ,a2 M = ResHnaff ⊗H aff M
                                                                                  a1    a2

(and similarly for Repfin
                       q ). Then as induction and restriction are exact functors,
these descend to give functors
                                                                      ·

                                                                         1 +a2
                                                                               )
                                                                   ∆a1 ,a2

and the properties of Ind and Res translate into the axioms of a bialgebra; viz:
     transitivity of induction becomes associativity of multiplication; tran-
     sitivity of restriction becomes coassociativity of comultiplication; the
     trivial representation of the trivial algebra H0aff is the unit, ditto for the
     counit, and the Mackey formula is the statement that ∆ is an algebra
     homomorphism.
  Similarly, define multiplication and comultiplication on K(Repfin    q ).

Remark 1. The comultiplication on K(Repaff      q ) is not cocommutative. However,
                                            aff
as we shall see, multiplication on K(Repq ) is commutative. Hence the bialgebra
K(Repaffq ) is the dual to the enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra; and Theorem 14.1
identifies this algebra. (The structure of the categories Repλq will be essential for
this identification.) Note that K(Repfinq ) is both commutative and cocommutative,
but because of the previous remark, and because of the structure of this as an
algebra over Z, it is more natural to think of this as the dual to an enveloping
algebra also. (That way it is a polynomial algebra; if we don’t take the dual it is a
divided power algebra.)

Remark 2. Structure on           Rep Sn . For r > 1, we can form embeddings of the
wreath product

making n≥0 Rep(Sn ≀ Zr ) into a Hopf algebra which again classically is known to
                                             L
be the rth tensor product of the Fock space     Rep Sn (see [Mc] for example).
    The algebras Hnλ are a deformation of the wreath product Sn ≀ Zr , and one can
ask if the embedding (5) exists for them. It is a consequence of theorem 14.3 that
it does not.. However, we always have an action of K(Repfin              λ
                                                           q ) on K(Repq ), which
is the Fock space structure when λ = Λ0 .
    This action of K(Repfin                λ
                           q ) on K(Repq ), even when λ = Λ0 is only part of the
story—the coaction of K(Repaff   q ) provides much more structure. Eventually we
                                 b ℓ acts on K(Repλ ), and the Bernstein-MacDonald
will see that the affine algebra sl                   q
Hopf algebra structure on K(Repfin     ) is  just the                            b ℓ . But

gebras. In particular, K(Repfin                        aff
                            q ) is a comodule for K(Repq ).

     More generally, if M ∈ Repλq , then ResHnaff ⊗H aff ev∗ (M ) is an element of Repq (Haλ ⊗

     This is saying there are significantly more operations of K(Repλq ) than appear
                                                                    F
at first sight. In particular, any exact functor Repaff
                                                    q − → R-mod gives a functor
K(Repλq ) → K(Repλq ) by composing the comodule structure with ⊗R F

If ⊗R F satisfies some finiteness conditions, we obtain left and right adjoint functors
Repλq → Repλq (which in favorable cases agree and are exact). We will now compute

     Define functors e∗i for q i ∈ µq ,

as follows. If M ∈ Rep Hnaff , e∗i M is the generalized eigenspace of Xn with eigen-
value q i . As Xn commutes with Hn−1  aff
                                            ֒→ Hnaff , e∗i M is an Hn−1
                                                                     aff

X1 acts in the same way on M and ei M , so if we define ei M = e∗i (ev∗ (M )) for

M ∈ Rep Hnλ , then we have e∗i M ∈ Repλq also.

Proof. e∗i is the composite of the exact functors of restriction and the functor of gen-
eralized eigenspace, which is exact on torsion (and in particular finite dimensional)
R[x]-modules.

Remark 3. In the abstract language favored in the previous section, we can write

where we have identified Repλq Hnaff with Rep Hnλ via ev∗ . Note that as M is finite
dimensional the direct limit stabilizes.
   As the functors e∗i are exact, we may try and find their adjoints. For formal
reasons, adjoints exist in Hnaff -mod and Hnλ -mod, but that is no guarantee they
exist in Rep Hnaff or Rep Hnλ (i.e. that they are finite dimensional). Nonetheless,

Proposition 8.2. If N ∈ Hnaff -mod, the inverse system
                                           prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm )
stabilizes after finitely many terms.
                      aff
Proof. If M is an Hn+1    -module generated by an R-subspace W ⊂ M , then prλ (M )
         λ
is an Hn+1 -module generated by the image of W . In particular, if M is finitely gen-
erated, then prλ (M ) is finite dimensional (it is a quotient of the finite dimensional
                 λ
vector space Hn+1     ⊗ W ). Now if N ∈ Hnaff -mod is generated by a subspace W ′ ,
Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm ) is generated by W ′ ⊠ q i J1 ≃ W ′ and the system pr(Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm ))
                               λ              λ
are all quotients of a fixed Hn+1 -module Hn+1   ⊗W ′ , which if N is finitely generated
is finite dimensional. Hence the inverse system stabilizes in this case.
    A more careful analysis shows that the system stabilizes for m greater than a
fixed constant which depends on n, λ and not on W ′ . This gives the proposition in
general, but as we will not use it for non-finitely generated modules, we will omit
further details.

We have defined fi∗ , fˇi∗ so that
Proposition 8.4. The functor fi∗ :Hn−1
                                     aff
                                         -mod → Hnλ -mod is left adjoint to e∗i :Hnλ -mod →
 aff                  ˇ
Hn−1 -mod. Similarly, fi is right adjoint to e∗i .
                       ∗


Proof. We prove fi∗ is left adjoint; the proof for fˇi∗ is similar. This is almost, but
not quite, a formal result. To see that, observe that if M ∈ Hnaff -mod,
                          e∗i M = −
                                  lim           i m
                                   → ker((Xn − q ) , Res M )
                                     m
                                                 i
                               =−→ HomR[Xn±1 ] (q Jm , Res M )
                                lim
                                     m

where the second limit is taken over the system q i J0 ← q i J1 ← · · · used in the
definition of fi∗ . This equals
                                              i
                             HomR[Xn±1 ] (lim
                                          ←− q Jm , Res M ).
                                            m

if M is finite dimensional, or more generally R[Xn±1 ](Xn −qi ) -torsion, but not in
general. (For example, if n = 1 and M = R[[Xn − q i ]] they clearly differ, and
indeed e∗i is not exact on the category of all Hnaff -modules.)
   However, if M ∈ Hnλ -mod, then as Hnλ is finite dimensional, these are equal,
and the direct and inverse limits above stabilize after finitely many terms (for
m ≥ dim Hnλ , to be crude). Hence if M ∈ Hnλ -mod, and N ∈ Hn−1  aff
                                                                     -mod, then

                                                           i           ∗
                                =−
                                 lim
                                  → HomHn−1

                                     m

as the direct limit stabilizes after finitely many terms, and this equals
                                                         i           ∗

                                =−→ HomHnaff (Ind(N ⊠ q Jm ), ev M ),
                                 lim
                                     m

as Ind is left adjoint to Res. As prλ = pr is left adjoint to ev∗ , we get
                                                         i
                                =−
                                 lim
                                  → HomHnλ (prλ Ind(N ⊠ q Jm ), M )
                                     m
                                                          i
                                = HomHnλ (lim

                                = HomHnλ (fi∗ N, M )
where we have used, once again, the fact that this limit of Hom’s stabilizes after
finitely many terms.
     In particular, restricting to finite dimensional modules Repλq , we get

  Note that the proof above shows for any N ∈ Hn−1 -mod, and any M ∈ Rep Hnλ ,
that
               Hom(fi∗ N, M ) = Hom(prλ Ind(N ⊠ lim   i

orbits of the symmetric group on (R× )n . A module M is in Reps Hnaff if M , when
considered as a module for Z(Hnaff ), has support a single orbit of Sn on (R× )n .
Further, if M is indecomposable and s = (s1 , . . . , sn ) ∈ (R× )n is such that the
weight space Ms = {m ∈ M | Xi · m = si m, 1 ≤ i ≤ n} is non-zero, then M ∈
Reps Hnaff . (Conversely, if M is indecomposable, there is always some s ∈ (R× )n
such that Ms 6= 0.)
   If s = (s1 , . . . , sn ), and q i ∈ {s1 , . . . , sn }, say sn = q i , let’s write s \ q i for the
unique orbit in (R× )n−1 /Sn−1 obtained by deleting q i from the list. Then lemma
8.1 has a refinement (which needs no proof).

{s1 , . . . , sn }.
  Dually, write s + q i for the orbit of Sn+1 · (s1 , . . . , sn , q i ) ∈ (R× )n+1 /Sn+1 . We
can now refine the previous proposition to:

                                  → Reps+qi Hnλ is left adjoint to e∗i : Reps+qi Hnλ →

Reps Hn−1 , and fi is right adjoint.
                                          λ
Proof. Let M be an indecomposable Hn−1        -module, and v a non-zero element in
the weight space Ms for some s ∈ (R ) . Then all vectors in Rv ⊠ q i Jm are
                                          × n

in the generalized eigenspace with eigenvalue s + q i , and hence all subquotients
of Ind(ev∗ M ⊠ q i Jm ) are in Reps+qi Hnaff . But if N ∈ Reps Hnaff , then prλ N ∈
Reps Hnλ , and so fi∗ M ∈ Reps+qi Hnλ . (The proof for fˇi∗ is similar.)

Lemma 8.8. If M ∈ Rep Hnλ , then

            n

Proof. For M ∈ Rep Hnλ , Xn acts on M with eigenvalues in µq , so (8.8) is immediate
                                                            P ∗         Hλ
from the definition of e∗i . But then (8.8) follows as both  fi and IndHnλ are left
                                                                                        n−1

                                        Rep Hn−1 ,     and left adjoints are unique when they
                 n−1
exist.

Corollary 8.9. As functors Repλq → Repλq , the functors fi∗ , fˇi∗ satisfy
 (i) f ∗ ≃ fˇ∗
        i      i


 (ii) fi∗ is exact.
                                                                              λ

Proof. As fi∗ , fˇi∗ are direct summands of the exact functor IndHn+1
                                                                   λ  , they are exact.
                                                                  n
Proposition 8.7 identifies them as the same direct summands.

Remark 4. We could also use this as a definition of fi∗ , but then we would not see
the uniform dependence on λ, or be able to prove the theorems of the next section.

Remark 5. Note that for N ∈ Rep Hn−1 ,
                                                      d ∗ N ⊠ q i Jm ).

   Because fi∗ is left adjoint to an exact functor, or because restriction and induction
take free modules to free modules, we observe
Lemma 8.10. If M ∈ Repλq is projective, then so are e∗i M and fi∗ M .
8.1. Divided Powers. We can do slightly better. Fix i ∈ µq . For each n ≥ 1 we
define the divided powers of e∗i and fi∗ as exact functors Repλq → Repλq .

     First, define ei        : Rep Ha+n → Rep Haaff as follows
                 (n)∗                               aff        a+n          H aff

where the limit is taken over the small category whose objects are the finite di-
mensional approximations P to a projective module for Hnaff which surjects onto

Hnaff . Morphisms from P to P ′ are commutative diagrams such that all maps are
surjective.

   Then define ei : Rep Ha+n  → Rep Haλ as ei ◦ev∗λ , and define fi : Repq Haaff →
        λ
Rep Ha+n    by
                               (n)∗                      a+n    H aff

                                                                  a     n
                                               P
We omit the proof that these are reasonable definitions—that they are exact func-
             (n)∗                                    (n)∗
tors, that fi     is both left and right adjoint to ei , that they preserve the prop-
erties of being finite dimensional, etc.
   More generally given an irreducible module L ∈ Rep Hnaff we get functors
                         aff
               ∆L : Rep Ha+n → Rep Haaff ,                      mL : Rep Haaff → Rep Ha+n
                                                                                      λ


by mimicking the above construction—just replace Ind(q i J1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ q i J1 ) above
                                                          (1)∗                  (1)∗
with L. If L is the module q i J1 for H1aff , ∆L = e∗i = ei    and mL = fi∗ = fi .
In general (and even for L = q i J1 ), these functors only have good properties in
the Grothendieck group. It is clear ∆L is the composite of the comodule action of
K(Repaff             λ
      q ) on K(Repq ) with the function δL of “multiplicity of L in the Jordan-
Holder series”
                        ∆                                       1⊗[L:   ]
     ∆L :K(Repλq ) −→ K(Repλq ) ⊗ K(Repaff
                                       q )−−−−−−→ K(Repλq ) ⊗Z Z = K(Repλq )
(see section 2.2 for the notation). In order to describe mL on the level of the
Grothendieck group we must introduce the Shapovalov inner product in K(Repλq );
then mL will be the adjoint of ∆L with respect to this inner product. This is done
in section 11.

                                  9. crystal graph
    In this section we will study certain “highest order” approximations to e∗i and fi∗ .
These approximations make sense for both cyclotomic and affine Hecke algebras,
unlike fi∗ itself, which is not defined for Repaff q . We summarise the properties of
these operators in a combinatorial structure, the crystal graph.
    There are three main results in this section. The first is theorem 9.4, which is
a strong multiplicity one theorem for restriction and induction. This tells us that
the crystal graph is well defined.
    The other two results are theorems 9.13 and theorem 9.15. These describe the
close connection between the the crystal graph structure and the representation
theory of the Hecke algebra.
    Theorem 9.13 shows that the integers εi (M ) have various interpretations. By
definition, if M is irreducible εi (M ) is the length of the longest chain of q i ’s that
end the spectrum of M . But we show that it is also the maximum size of a Jordan
block of Xn with eigenvalue q i on the module M , i.e. that it measures the failure
of semsimplicity of the action of Xn . It is also the dimension of Hom(e∗i M, e∗i M )—
another subtle measure of lack of semisimplicity, as well as the multiplicity of the
cosocle of e∗i M in e∗i M . These last two statements show that the cosocle of e∗i (M )
fits into e∗i (M ) in a uniserial chain of length εi (M ) in as simple a way as possible.
    The analogous results for fi∗ is theorem 9.15. This is much harder, and the
particular proof we give requires the results of the next few sections. The asymmetry
is a nice shadow of the fact that whereas the dual of a finite dimensional lowest
weight sl2 module is again a lowest weight module, the dual of an integrable lowest
weight slb ℓ -module is a highest weight module. Nonetheless, the sl2 structure is the
relevant one, and we eventually show ϕi (M ) may also be read off the spectrum of
M.
    The results of section 11 show that εi , ϕi also admit an interpretation in terms
of the structure of projective modules.


9.1. First properties. To save repetition in notation, we will allow Hnλ to denote
the affine Hecke algebra as well as the cyclotomic Hecke algebra,
                                                               P     i.e. we allow λ to
be either the symbol “aff”, or a function λ:µq → Z+ with         λi < ∞. We say λ is
affine or cyclotomic, as appropriate. For consistency in notation, define praff , ev∗aff
to be the identity functors from Repq Hnaff → Repq Hnaff .
   With this understood we write Bλ for the disjoint union of the set of isomorphism
classes of irreducible representations on Hnλ , for n ≥ 0. Let ZBλ be the free abelian
group on the set Bλ , and define a non-degenerate symmetric pairing on ZBλ by
making the elements of Bλ an orthonormal basis. We will identify Z+ Bλ with
isomorphism classes of semisimple Hnλ -modules, and the symmetric pairing with
dimR Hom( , ). (There is a canonical isomorphism of abelian groups—without
the symmetric pairing—from the Grothendieck group K(Repλq ) to ZBλ , but this
will not be so useful for what follows.)
   Now, define for M ∈ Rep Hnλ
                                                  aff
                                           H

As eei (M ) is semisimple and eei (M ⊕ M ′ ) = eei (M ) ⊕ eei (M ′ ), eei defines a Z+ -linear
operator on isomorphism classes of semisimple Hnλ -modules, and hence an oper-
ator eei :ZBλ → ZBλ . Similarly, fei defines an operator ZBλ → ZBλ , as prλ of a
semisimple module is still semisimple. These are adjoint operators with respect to
the inner product on ZBλ , i.e.:

Lemma 9.1. If N is a semisimple Hn−1 -module, and M a semisimple Hnλ -module,
                         HomHn−1
                             λ   (N, eei M ) = HomHnλ (fei N, M ).
Proof. As N is semisimple,

                                        i           ∗
             HomHn−1
                 aff (N, soc Hom   ±1 (q J1 , Res ev M ))
                                R[Xn ]
                                                       i           ∗
                              = HomHn−1
                                    aff (N, Hom   ±1 (q J1 , Res ev M ))
                                               R[Xn ]
                                                     i           ∗
                              = HomHn−1
                                    aff ⊗H aff (N ⊠ q J1 , Res ev M )
                                          1

                              = HomHnaff (Ind(N ⊠ q i J1 ), ev∗ M )
         by adjointness. Now, as ev∗ M is semisimple, this is
                              = HomHnaff (cosoc Ind(N ⊠ q i J1 ), ev∗ M )
                              = HomHnλ (prλ cosoc Ind(N ⊠ q i J1 ), M ).



As with the operators fi∗ the order of the operations defining fei is not crucial. We
have:
                                            aff
                                   H
Lemma 9.2. fei (M ) = cosoc(prλ IndHnaff         aff    (ev∗λ M ⊠ q i J1 )).
                                           n−1 ⊗H1

Proof. We may finish the above proof differently, noticing ev∗ M is still semisimple,
to get
     HomHn−1
         λ   (N, eei M ) = HomHnλ (prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i J1 ), M )
                                                  = HomHnλ (cosoc prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i J1 ), M )
It follows that both fei and this new operator define adjoints to eei :ZBλ → ZBλ .
But the symmetric pairing Hom( , ) is non-degenerate, and so these two operators
must be equal.
In fact, we will show in theorem 9.9 that we may even replace J1 with Jm in the
definitions of eei and fei .
   We have implicitly used the map
                                     ev∗ :ZBλ ֒→ ZBaff
induced by ev∗ : Rep Hnaff → Rep Hnλ . The definitions of e∗i and fi∗ make the follow-
ing lemma obvious.
Lemma 9.3.          (i) eei ev∗ M = ev∗ e
                                        ei M , for M ∈ Bλ .

 (ii) If M ∈ Bλ , ev∗ fei M is a direct summand of fei (ev∗ M ).

Theorem 9.4. If M is an irreducible Hnλ -module, then eei M and fei M are either
irreducible or zero. Further, if N 6= 0, then eei M = N if and only if M = fei N .
   The theorem will be proved after proposition 9.8 below.

   As a result, we can summarize the operators e
graph, with edges labelled by the elements of µq . The vertices of the graph are the
elements of Bλ , and M is joined to N by an arrow colored by i ∈ µq

                                                  →N
if eei M = N ; equivalently if N = fei M . This datum (Bλ , eei , fei ) is called a crystal
graph, after Kashiwara. Note that as a consequence of the lemma 9.3, ev∗ in-
duces an inclusion of crystal graphs, Bλ → Baff . We record one immediate formal
consequence of this fact:

Corollary 9.5. If M ∈ Baff , (prλ fei )k M = prλ (feik M ).

Proof. By induction on k, (pr fei )k M = pr fei pr feik−1 M , and pr feik−1 M is either 0 or
feik−1 M , so (pr fei )k M is either 0 or pr feik M . So if pr feik M = 0, then (pr fei )k M = 0
also, and if pr feik M 6= 0, it equals feik M (by the theorem), so eei (pr feik M ) = feik−1 M ∈
Rep Hnλ , and so feik−1 M = pr feik−1 M . Hence (pr fei )k M = pr feik M here also.

   Define, for M ∈ Bλ
                                εi (M ) = max{n ≥ 0 | eeni M 6= 0}

                               ϕi (M ) = max{n ≥ 0 | fein M 6= 0}
so that εi (M ) ∈ Z+ (and indeed if M ∈ Rep Hnλ , εi (M ) ≤ n), and ϕi (M ) ∈
Z+ ∪ {∞}. Note that if λ = aff then ϕi (M ) = ∞ always. We will see in theorem
9.15 that if λ is cyclotomic then ϕi (M ) is always finite.

9.2. Detailed study of the crystal graph. We now start to seriously study the

restriction.
   Let us also write

Proof. Clearly, (i) and (ii) are equivalent to the existence of a nonzero map of
    ±1            ±1
R[Xa+1 , . . . , Xa+n ]-modules

By Frobenius reciprocity, this is equivalent to the existence of a nonzero map of

The crucial technical result we will need to prove the theorem is:
Proposition 9.7. Let M ∈ Rep Haaff , and suppose εi (M ) = 0. Then the exact
sequence of Haaff ⊗ Hnaff -modules
                                           a+n
                0 → M ⊠ q i Kn → Resa+n              i
                                    a,n Inda,n (M ⊠ q Kn ) → A → 0

splits. Moreover, for every subquotient A of A,
                              ExtHaaff ⊗Hnaff (A, Haaff ⊠ q i Kn ) = 0.
Proof. By the Mackey formula, A admits a filtration whose graded pieces are
                              (a,n)                      (a,n)
                  Γw = Ind(a,n) T w(a,n) w−1 Res(a,n)∩w(a,n) (M ⊠ q i Kn )
where w runs over representatives for all the cosets S(a,n) \Sa+n / S(a,n) except for
the coset S(a,n) .
                                               ±1              ±1
    Now consider Γw as a module for R[Xa+1          , . . . , Xa+n ], and suppose s = (sa+1 , . . . ,
                × n
sa+n ) ∈ (R ) is in its support; i.e. Γw [s] 6= 0. Fix w ∈ S(a,n) \Sa+n / S(a,n) ,
not the identity double coset S(a,n) . By the shuffle lemma 5.5, there must be
some sγ , a < γ ≤ a + n, such that the sγ -weight space of Xa on M is nonzero,
i.e. {m ∈ M | (Xa − sγ )dim M · m = 0} 6= 0. As eei M = 0, sγ 6= q i . So we have
shown there is some γ , a < γ ≤ a + n, with sγ 6= q i .
    It follows that Γw , when considered as a module for Z(Hnaff ) has support disjoint
from (q i · · · q i ). As this is the support of q i Kn , we see that all subquotients of Γw ,
considered as an Hnaff -module, are in different blocks from q i Kn . The proposition
follows.
        (n)
Write fei M = cosoc Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ), for M ∈ Rep Haaff .
Proposition 9.8. Suppose M ∈ Rep Haaff is irreducible, and εi (M ) = 0. Then
        (n)
  (i) fei M is irreducible.
 (ii) If A is an irreducible subquotient of the kernel of the map
                          Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ) ։ cosoc Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn )
                                           (n)
       then εi (A) < n Further, εi (fei M ) = n.
                                                                   (n)     (n)
 (iii) If M, N ∈ Rep Haaff are irreducible, and εi (M ) = 0 then fei M = fei N
       implies M = N .
         (n) (m)       (n+m)                      (n)
 (iv) fei fei M = fei        M . In particular, fei M = fein M .
                  (n)
Proof. (i) As fei M is semisimple, we will know it is irreducible if we show d =
            (n)   (n)                                                       (n)
dim Hom(fei M, fei M ) equals 1. Note that cosoc(X) = 0 only if X = 0, so fei M
is nonzero, and we must show d ≤ 1.

  Write S for the kernel
                                        (n)
(6)        0 → S → Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ) ։ fei M = cosoc Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ) → 0.

As Res = Resn+a
            n,a is exact, we have an exact sequence

                                                          (n)
                 0 → Res S → Res Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ) ։ Res fei M → 0,
and by the technical proposition 9.7 Res Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ) = M ⊠ q i Kn ⊕ A. So
      (n)
Res fei M = M ⊠ q i Kn ⊕ A, where M ⊠ q i Kn is a quotient of M ⊠ q i Kn , and A is
a quotient of A. Now,
                       (n)    (n)                             (n)
                 Hom(fei M, fei M ) = Hom(Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ), fei M )
                                                                 (n)
                                        = Hom(M ⊠ q i Kn , Res fei M )

     (n)
as fei M is semisimple, and Ind adjoint to Res. But this equals

                                        = Hom(M ⊠ q i Kn , M ⊠ q i Kn )

by the technical proposition 9.7. As M ⊠ q i Kn is irreducible, either M ⊠ q i Kn is
zero, and d = 0, or M ⊠ q i Kn = M ⊠ q i Kn , and d = 1. We have already observed
             (n)
d 6= 0, so fei M is irreducible, nonzero.
    (ii) As the sequence (6) is exact, this also shows that Res S embeds into Res A.
Now let A be an irreducible subquotient of S. Then to show εi (A) < n, it suffices
to show HomHnaff (q i Kn , Resa+n
                               a,n A) is zero. But Res A is a subquotient of Res A,
                                                              (n)
and the technical proposition 9.7 gives the result. As Res fei M = M ⊠ q i Kn ⊕ A
                       (n)
it is clear that εi (fei M ) = n.
                                                                            (n)
    (iii) Suppose N ∈ Rep Haaff is irreducible. Then by semisimplicity of fei M and
adjunction, we get
                 (n)    (n)                                    (n)
           Hom(fei N, fei M ) =         Hom(N ⊠ q i Kn , Res fei M )
                                   =    Hom(N ⊠ q i Kn , M ⊠ q i Kn ), as before
                                   =    Hom(N, M ), as N, M semisimple.
     (n)     (n)
So fei N = fei M ⇐⇒ N = M .
  (iv) To show (iv), observe that as we have a surjection
                                                                       (m)
      Ind(M ⊠ q i Km ) ⊠ q i Kn ։ cosoc Ind(M ⊠ q i Km ) ⊠ q i Kn = fei      M ⊠ q i Kn
we also get a surjection
                                                                   (m)
      Ind(M ⊠ q i Km+n ) = Ind(Ind(M ⊠ q i Km ) ⊠ q i Kn ) ։ Ind(fei M ⊠ q i Kn ).
Given a surjective map X ։ Y , we get an induced surjection on cosocles, cosoc X ։
cosoc Y , so a surjective map
                                 (m+n)       (n) (m)
                               fei     M ։ fei (fei M ).
     (m+n)
As fei     M is irreducible, this is an isomorphism.

We now prove the theorem 9.4.
26                                          I. Grojnowski


Proof. It is clearly enough to prove it for Hnaff -modules, as lemma 9.3 implies the
result for cyclotomic Hecke algebras.
                                          aff
   Suppose M ∈ Baff is an irreducible Hm      -module, and write n = εi (M ). Then if
M is semisimple,
                         Hom(M, eeni M ) = Hom(fein M, M ).
So if M is a simple summand of eeni M , then eei M = 0 and the proposition 9.8 shows
fein M = M . If M ′ is another simple summand of eeni M , then fein M ′ = fein M , so
M ′ = M . It follows that M = eeni M .
     We have just seen that every irreducible module is of the form fein M , where
εi (M ) = 0. It follows that fei N is irreducible, for all irreducible modules N . Finally,
let X be a summand of e      ei fein M , where εi (M ) = 0, M is irreducible. Then X =
fi N , for some N with εi (N ) = 0, as Hom(X, eei fein M ) = Hom(fei X, fein M ). It
 e m

follows that fei X = fein M , so feim+1 N = fein M , whence m = n − 1 and N = M . So
ei fein M = X = fein−1 M , as desired.
e

The previous theorem used the result that q i Kn is an irreducible in Reps Hnaff , where
s = (q i · · · q i ). The next theorem uses the fact that this is the only irreducible in
this block.
Theorem 9.9.          (i) For any irreducible M ∈ Rep Hnλ , and m > 0
                                                    aff
                                             H
                     fei (M ) = prλ cosoc IndHn+1            ∗      i
                                               aff ⊗H aff (evλ M ⊠ q Jm ).
                                                    n     1


      In particular, if λ is cyclotomic, then fei (M ) = cosoc fi∗ (M ).
 (ii) For any irreducible M ∈ Rep Hnλ , and m > 0
                                                              H aff
                   eei (M ) = soc HomR[Xn±1 ] (q i Jm , ResHn+1          ∗
                                                            aff ⊗H aff evλ M ).
                                                                n     1

        In particular, eei (M ) =   soc e∗i (M ).
Proof. It is enough to prove (i). For, if M and N are semisimple Hnλ -modules, then
by (i) and adjointness Hom(fei M, N ) = Hom(cosoc fi∗ M, N ) = Hom(fi∗ M, N ) =
Hom(M, e∗i N ) = Hom(M, soc e∗i N ) and so both eei and soc e∗i are adjoint to fei :ZBλ →
ZBλ . As the symmetric pairing Hom( , ) is non-degenerate, they must be equal.
    So we prove (i). In fact, we prove a stronger statement. Let P ∈ Repq Hnaff be
any indecomposable module with cosocle q i Kn , so P ։ q i Kn . Define fP (M ) =
                                                                      (n)
cosoc Ind(M ⊠ P ), for any M ∈ Repq Hnaff . Clearly fP (M ) ։ fei (M ). We will
                                          (n)
show that if εi (M ) = 0, fP (M ) = fei (M ) = fein (M ) is irreducible. Now, the
socle filtration of P has subquotients isomorphic to q i Kn . It follows that we can
filter Ind(M ⊠P ) with subquotients isomorphic to Ind(M ⊠q i Kn ). Hence fP (M ) =
                                                                                     (n)
cosoc Ind(M ⊠P ) is some summand of some copies of cosoc Ind(M ⊠q i Kn ) = fei M
(for any filtered module Z = ∪Zj , cosoc(Z) is a summand of ⊕ cosoc(Zj /Zj−1 )).
But
                 (n)                        (n)
     Hom(fP M, fei M ) = Hom(Ind(M ⊠ P ), fei M ) =
                                           (n)
                          Hom(M ⊠ P, Res fei M ) = Hom(M ⊠ P, M ⊠ q i Kn ) = R.
                         (n)
It follows that fP M = fei M .

     Note that this implies if cosoc(P ) = q i Kn , and cosoc(P ′ ) = q i Kn′ , then fP fP′ =
         ′        ′
fein fein = fein+n = fInd(P ⊠P ′ ) .
                                                      (n)
     Now, if M is any simple Haλ -module, M = fei M for some M with εi (M ) = 0.
Take P = Indn+1          i         i                                      en+1 M = fei M is
                   n,1 (q Kn ⊠ q Jm ). Then fqi Jm (M ) = fP (M ) = fi
irreducible, as desired.
This has the following simple consequence:

For example, if n = 2, and M = q i−1 J1 , they are clearly different.
   We finish the section with some alternate characterizations of εi and ϕi .
Theorem 9.13. Let N be an irreducible module in Repλq . Then
  (i) εi (N ) is the maximal size of a Jordan block for R[[Xn − q i ]] on N .
                                                        P
 (ii) In K(Repλq ), we have e∗i N = εi (N ) · eei (N ) + aα Mα , where Mα are irre-
      ducible modules with εi (Mα ) < εi (N ) − 1.
(iii) εi (N ) = dim Hom(e∗i N, e∗i N ).
Proof. We may suppose that N = fein M = cosoc Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ), where M is
an irreducible Haλ -module and εi (M ) = 0. By the Mackey formula and “shuffle
lemma,” if P ։ q i Kn is some module covering q i Kn we have an exact sequence

                                          aff      i
                       HomHa+n−1
                           aff   ⊗H1aff (Ha+n−1 ⊠ q J1 , Q) = 0.

Hence taking the q i -eigenspace of Xn , we get
                       e∗i Inda+n               a+n−1       ∗
                              a,n (M ⊠ P ) = Inda,n−1 (M ⊠ ei P )

and that εei (Ind(M ⊠ P )) = εei (P ), where we denote the maximal size of a Jordan
block of R[[Xn − q i ]] on a module N by εei (N ). We now apply this for P = q i Kn .
Write, for m ≤ n
                       0 → Sm → Ind(M ⊠ q i Km ) → fem M → 0   i

for the exact sequence defining feim M . We prove (ii). Apply e∗i to this exact
sequence, to get
                 0 → e∗ Sn → Ind(M ⊠ e∗ (q i Kn )) → e∗ fen M → 0.
                         i                       i                 i i

Now, in K(Repλq ), e∗i (q i Kn ) is a multiple of q i Kn−1 , as this is the unique irreducible
module with this central character. Comparing dimensions, we see that e∗i (q i Kn ) =
n · q i Kn−1 , and so in K(Repaff a+n ) we have

         e∗i fein M = n · Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn−1 ) − e∗i Sn = nfein−1 M + nSn−1 − e∗i Sn .
By proposition 9.8, (ii), every subquotient A of Sn has εi (A) < m, and so the right
hand side of the proposition is of the desired form. Finally, as fein M is in K(Rep Hnλ ),
it follows the non-zero terms in this expression are also (after cancelling).
    We now prove (i). As Ind(M ⊠ q i Kn ) ։ fein M , (∗) implies
                                   εei (fein M ) ≤ εei (q i Kn ).
But by proposition 9.8, (ii) and its proof, the Haλ ⊗ Hnaff -module M ⊠ q i Kn does
occur as a submodule of Res(fein M ) (in fact, with multiplicity one). It follows that
                                   εei (fein M ) ≥ εei (q i Kn ).
It remains to show εei (q i Kn ) = n = εi (q i Kn ).
   We show inductively that if αm 6= 0 in the exact sequence
                                                                    α
                                                               → Hom(q i J1 , q i Kn )
         0 → Hom(q i Jm−1 , q i Kn ) → Hom(q i Jm , q i Kn ) −−m
then Hom(q i Jm , q i Kn ) = m · q i Kn−1 . in the Grothendieck group of Hn−1        aff
                                                                                          modules.
As εei (q i Kn ) is the smallest integer m for which αm+1 = 0, and Hom(q i Jεei (qi Kn ) , q i Kn ) =
e∗i (q i Kn ), this will finish us up. But Hom(q i J1 , q i Kn ) is eei (q i Kn ), which is q i Kn−1
as it is irreducible and non-zero. Our induction starts with m = 0, where it is clear
by these remarks. Likewise, if m > 0, then if αm is non-zero it must be a surjection
onto q i Kn−1 , hence the result.
     We now show that (i) and (ii) imply (iii). By (i), the operators of multiplication
by (Xn − q i )k are non-zero for 0 ≤ k < εi (N ), and zero for k = εi (N ). Hence
they are linearly independent, and dim Hom(e∗i N, e∗i N ) ≥ εi (N ). For the reverse
inequality, observe that for any module X with cosocle eei N
                                dim Hom(X, e∗i N ) ≤ εi (N ),
as one sees by filtering e∗i N so it has semisimple quotients and applying (ii). Now
take X = e∗i N .

     Let us write, for an irreducible Hnaff -module N
                                     ε∧             ∗
                                      i (N ) = εi (σ N )

where σ:Hnaff → Hnaff Ti 7→ −(Tn−i + 1 − q), Xi 7→ Xn+1−i is the diagram auto-
morphism of Hnaff . Then ε∧                                  × n
                             i (N ) is the maximum, as s ∈ (R ) varies with Ns 6= 0,
                                  i
of the length of the chain of q s beginning s. (This is immediate as εi (N ) is the
maximal length of the chain of q i s ending s with Ns 6= 0.) The previous theorem
tells us ε∧                                                               i
          i (N ) is also the maximal size of a Jordan block for R[[X1 − q ]] on N ;
hence
Corollary 9.14. If N is an irreducible Hnaff -module, then
                 prλ N 6= 0      ⇐⇒        ε∧
                                            i (N ) ≤ λi ,           for all i ∈ µq .
   We now give descriptions of ϕi parallel to that of εi . The proof of the following
theorem will not be completed until section 12.

Theorem 9.15. Let N be an irreducible module in Repλq , where λ is cyclotomic.
Then
  (i) ϕi (N ) is the smallest integer m for which fi∗ N = prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm ).
 (ii) In the Grothendieck group K(Repλq ),
                                                       X
                          fi∗ N = ϕi (N ) · fei (N ) +   a′α Mα′
      where Mα are irreducible modules with εi (Mα′ ) < εi (N ) + 1.
(iii) ϕi (N ) = dim Hom(fi∗ N, fi∗ N ).
Proof. We first show (i) and (ii) are equivalent. Suppose the surjective map
                     prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm ) ։ prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm−1 )
is not an isomorphism. We claim that it follows that
                  prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm ) = m · fei (N ) + smaller terms,
(where we mean equality in the Grothendieck group, and smaller terms means a
sum of modules A for which εi (A) < εi (fei (N )). The proof is by induction. We
have an exact sequence
                          α                           γm
                           → prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm ) −−→ prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm−1 ) → 0.
    prλ Ind(N ⊠ q i J1 ) −−m
By assumption, αm 6= 0, so the image of αm contains a copy of the irreducible mod-
ule cosoc prλ Ind(N ⊠q i J1 ) = fei (N ). As prλ Ind(N ⊠q i J1 ) = fei (N )+ smaller terms,
the induction is complete if we show that γm is an isomorphism implies γm+k is
                                                               k               k
also, for k ≥ 0. But this is clear—factor αm+k = θm              ◦ αm , where θm is the map
                 k
induced from x :Jm → Jm+k . But now αm = 0 and so αm+k = 0 and hence γm+k
is an isomorphism.
          ei (N ) for the smallest integer m for which fi∗ N = pr Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm ). We
    Write ϕ
have just shown that for m > ϕ    ei (N ), N ⊠ q i Jϕe i N is a submodule of Res pr Ind(N ⊠
q Jm ). It follows that for such m, Rϕe i N = Hom(N ⊠ q i Jm , N ⊠ q i Jϕe i N ) is a
  i

submodule of
            Hom(Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm ), pr Ind(N ⊠ q i Jm )) = Hom(fi∗ N, fi∗ N ),
and so dim Hom(fi∗ N, fi∗ N ) ≥ ϕ
                                ei (N ). On the other hand, as in the proof of 9.13,
for any module X with cosocle fei N , we have
                              dim Hom(X, fi∗ N ) ≤ ϕ
                                                   ei (N ).
Taking X = fi∗ N we see (iii) is equivalent to (i) and (ii).
     Now let us show ϕ   ei (N ) ≥ ϕi (N ). But this is immediate from Frobenius reci-
procity: any embedding R[X1 ]/(X1 − q i )m ֒→ q i Km induces a map Ind(N ⊠
q i Jϕi (N ) ) → Res pr Ind(N ⊠ q i Kϕi (N ) ), which when restricted to Hnaff ⊗ H1aff in-
                                                 ϕ (N )
duces an injection N ⊠ q i Jϕi (N ) ֒→ Res fei i N . It follows that ϕ  ei (N ) ≥ ϕi (N ).
The reverse inequality will be proved in section 12.

                                10. Serre relations
   In this section we study the relation of εi (feiq±1 N ) to εi (N ). To simplify notation
we will write i = 1, so iq = q; this has no effect other than to make the notation
readable. We will also write Km rather than q 0 Km , and similarly for Jm , and we
shall write q i rather than q i J1 when this causes no confusion.
30                                      I. Grojnowski


    The case q = −1 is different from the case q 6= −1; for most of the section we will
assume q 6= −1. The main results of the section are proposition 10.4, which holds
for q 6= −1, and its counterpart proposition 10.5, which covers the case q = −1.
q 6= −1 First, suppose q 6= −1. Then we have a short exact sequence of H2aff -
modules
                        0 → 1(1q) → Ind(q ⊠ 1) → St(q1) → 0
which does not split; here 1(1q) and St(q1) are the one dimensional modules with
spectra (1q) and (q1) respectively.
  Hence for m ≥ 1 we have a short exact sequence (∗∗)
0 → Ind(N ⊠ 1(1q) ⊠ Km−1 ) → Ind(N ⊠ q ⊠ Km ) → Ind(N ⊠ St(q1) ⊠ Km−1 ) → 0.

Proposition 10.1. Suppose q 6= −1. Then for all irreducible N ∈ Rep Haλ , and
all m ≥ 1
   (i) Ind(1(1q) ⊠ Km ) ≃ Ind(Km ⊠ 1(1q) ) is irreducible.
  (ii) Ind(N ⊠ Km ⊠ 1(1q) ) is indecomposable, with simple cosocle.
 (iii) Ind(St(q1) ⊠ Km ) ≃ Ind(Km ⊠ St(q1) ) is irreducible.
 (iv) Ind(N ⊠ Km ⊠ St(q1) ) is indecomposable, with simple cosocle.
Proof. We prove (i) and (ii); as (iii) and (iv) are similar (or indeed are formal con-
sequences, upon applying the obvious automorphism of Hnaff ). By the classification
of H3aff -modules, when q 6= −1,
                             Ind(1(1q) ⊠ 1) ≃ Ind(1 ⊠ 1(1q) )
is irreducible; hence by transitivity of induction
Ind(1(1q) ⊠ 1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ 1) = Ind(1 ⊠ 1(1q) ⊠ · · · ⊠ 1) = · · · = Ind(1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ 1 ⊠ 1(1q) ).
But the Mackey formula implies that 1(1q) ⊠ Km occurs with multiplicity one in
Res Ind(1(1q) ⊠ Km ), hence the useful observation (lemma 5.9) shows Ind(Km ⊠
1(1q) ) is irreducible.
   To prove (ii), observe that if X ։ Y is a surjection, then cosoc(X) ։ cosoc(Y ),
so as N is a quotient of Ind(N e ⊠ Km ) for some Ne with ε1 (N ) = 0, it is enough to
show (ii) when ε1 (N ) = 0. We play with the Mackey formula again as in theorem
9.13, so we will be terse. Write Res = Resa+m+2
                                            a,m+2 . Then the sequence

         0 → N ⊠ Ind(Km ⊠ 1(1q) ) → Res Ind(N ⊠ Km ⊠ 1(1q) ) → U → 0
splits, as the shuffle lemma shows the central character of U differs from that of
N ⊠ Ind(Km ⊠ 1(1q) ). It follows, as in 9.8, that
            Res cosoc Ind(N ⊠ Km ⊠ 1(1q) ) = N ⊠ Ind(Km ⊠ 1(1q) ) ⊕ U ,
where U is some quotient of U , and that
        Hom(cosoc Ind(N ⊠ Km ⊠ 1(1q) ), cosoc Ind(N ⊠ Km ⊠ 1(1q) )) =
                     Hom(N ⊠ Ind(Km ⊠ 1(1q) ), N ⊠ Ind(Km ⊠ 1(1q) )) = R,
the last equality as Ind(Km ⊠ 1(1q) ) is irreducible by (i).

  For N ∈ Bλ , define fei qi (N ) = prλ cosoc Ind(N ⊠ 1(iqi) ), and feqi i (N ) = prλ cosoc
Ind(N ⊠ St(qii) ). As a corollary of the proposition, feqi i N and fei qi N are irreducible
modules, if q 6= −1. (If q = −1 this is no longer true.)

Lemma 10.2. (i) If A is an irreducible constituent of Ind(N ⊠ 1(1q) ⊠ Km−1 ),
       then ε1 (A) ≤ ε1 (N ) + m − 1.
  (ii) If A is an irreducible constituent of Ind(N ⊠ Km−1 ⊠ St(q1) ), then ε1 (A) ≤
       ε1 (N ) + m. Moreover, if ε1 (A) = ε1 (N ) + m, then A is an irreducible con-
       stituent of Ind(fe1m−1 N ⊠ St(q1) ).
 (iii) If Q is an irreducible quotient of Ind(N ⊠ Km−1 ⊠ St(q1) ), then ε1 (Q) =
       ε1 (N ) + m.
Proof. (i) and the first part of (ii) are immediate from the shuffle lemma. As
                                P
Ind(N ⊠Km−1 ) = fe1m−1 N + aα Mα , where ε1 (Mα ) < ε1 (N )+m−1 by proposition
9.8, the last part of (ii) follows by another application of the shuffle lemma.
    Finally, to prove (iii), it is enough to show ε1 (Q) ≥ ε1 (N ) + m. Further, we
                                                             ε (N )
may again assume ε1 (N ) = 0, as the cosocle of Ind(e      e11 N ⊠ Kε1 (N )+m−1 ⊠
St(q1) ) surjects onto the cosocle of Ind(N ⊠ Km−1 ⊠ St(q1) ). Now, if Q is an irre-
ducible quotient as in (iii), Frobenius reciprocity gives a non-zero homomorphism
N ⊠ Ind(Km−1 ⊠ St(q1) ) → Q; hence ε1 (Q) ≥ ε1 (N ⊠ Ind(Km−1 ⊠ St(q1) )). But
Ind(Km−1 ⊠ St(q1) ) = Ind(St(q1) ⊠ Km−1 ) by the previous proposition, and so
ε1 (Q) ≥ m.

  We have shown that
              Ind(N ⊠ 1(1q) ⊠ Km−1 ) = fe1 q fe1m−1 N + smaller terms,
and
                 Ind(N ⊠ St(q1) ⊠ Km−1 ) = cosoc + smaller terms,
where all the terms in the cosocle have ε1 = ε1 (N ) + m. As Ind(N ⊠ q ⊠ Km )
surjects onto fe1m feq N for m ≥ 0, and we have a filtration of Ind(N ⊠ q ⊠ Km ) as in
(∗∗), we have proved most of
Proposition 10.3. Precisely one of the following alternatives hold
 (i) For all m ≥ 1, fem feq N = fe1 q fem−1 N , and for all m ≥ 0
                       1                   1

                       ε1 (fe1m feq N )   = m − 1 + ε1 (N ),      or

 (ii) For all m ≥ 1, fe1m feq N is a summand of cosoc Ind(fe1m−1 N ⊠ St(q1) ), and for
      all m ≥ 0,
                               ε1 (fem feq N ) = m + ε1 (N ).
                                     1

Proof. We have proved everything for m ≥ 1; to finish we must only observe that
ε1 (fe1 feq N ) = ε1 (feq N ) + 1, and so we have the assertions for m = 0 also.

   Now let N be an irreducible Hnλ -module, with λ cyclotomic. Let us agree to
write fei for the affine crystal operator cosoc Ind(• ⊠ q i ), and write pr fei for the
cyclotomic crystal operator.

Proposition 10.4. Let N be an irreducible Hnλ -module, and suppose prλ feq N 6= 0.
Then precisely one of the following holds:
  (i) ε1 (feq N ) = ε1 (N ) − 1, and ϕ1 (feq N ) = ϕ1 (N ), or
 (ii) ε1 (feq N ) = ε1 (N ), and ϕ1 (feq N ) = ϕ1 (N ) + 1.
32                                      I. Grojnowski


Proof. Write ϕ = ϕ1 (N ). First suppose ε1 (feq N ) = ε1 (N ) − 1. Then the surjection
Ind(1q) → 1(1q) induces a surjection, hence isomorphism

         feq fe1m N = cosoc Ind(N ⊠ Km ⊠ q) ։ cosoc Ind(N ⊠ Km−1 ⊠ 1(1q) )
                                                   = fe1 q fe1m−1 N = fe1m feq N

for all m ≥ 1. It follows that prλ fe1ϕ+1 feq N = prλ feq fe1ϕ+1 N = 0. To show
prλ fe1ϕ feq N 6= 0, we compute ε∧    em e
                                   α (f1 fq N ) for all α ∈ µq and invoke corollary 9.14.
   The shuffle lemma shows ε1 (Ind(fe1m N ⊠ q)) ≤ ε∧
                                  ∧                           em
                                                           1 (f1 N ), hence the definition of
ϕ and corollary 9.14 shows ε∧        e e
                                      ϕ
                                 1 (f1 fq N ) ≤ λ1 .
   Similarly, the shuffle lemma shows that for all m, ε∧             e               ∧ e
                                                               q Ind(fq N ⊠ Km ) ≤ εq (fq N )
and ε∧      e                                                           e
       q (fq N ) ≤ λq by corollary 9.14 and the assumption prλ fq N 6= 0. We clearly
         ∧ em e           ∧
have εα (f1 fq N ) ≤ εα (N ) ≤ λα for α ∈        / {1, q}, and all m ≥ 0. Thus another
application of corollary 9.14 shows prλ (f1 fq N ) 6= 0, so ϕ1 (feq N ) = ϕ.
                                               eϕe

   Now suppose ε1 (feq N ) = ε1 (N ). The argument of the last paragraph applies
equally well here, so to show prλ (fe1ϕ+1 feq N ) 6= 0 we must only show ε∧       em e
                                                                               1 (f1 fq N ) ≤
 ∧ em−1
ε1 (f1 N ) for all m ≥ 1. But this is immediate from the shuffle lemma, as in this
case fe1m feq N is a quotient of Ind(fe1m−1 N ⊠ St(q1) ).
   Finally, observe that Frobenius reciprocity implies that fe1m−1 N ⊠ St(q1) is con-
tained in Res(fe1m feq N ), so if ε∧    em−1 N ) > λ1 , then ε∧ (fem feq N ) > λ1 also. It
                                    1 (f1                         1  1
follows that prλ fe1ϕ+2 feq N = 0, and so ϕ1 (feq N ) = ϕ + 1 in this case.

q = −1 We now suppose q = −1. The analogue of proposition 10.4 is

Proposition 10.5. Let N be an irreducible Hnλ -module, and suppose prλ feq N 6= 0.
Then precisely one of the following holds:
   (i) ε1 (feq N ) = ε1 (N ) − 2, and ϕ1 (feq N ) = ϕ1 (N ),     or
  (ii) ε1 (feq N ) = ε1 (N ) − 1, and ϕ1 (feq N ) = ϕ1 (N ) + 1,    or
            e                         e
 (iii) ε1 (fq N ) = ε1 (N ), and ϕ1 (fq N ) = ϕ1 (N ) + 2.

Proof. We merely sketch the necessary modifications in the definitions needed to
prove this. Recall that there are 3 irreducible representations of H3aff with central
character S3 · (11q). Denote them α, α, γ with ch α = 2(11q), ch α = 2(q11),
ch γ = (1q1). The representations Ind(1 ⊠ α) and Ind(1 ⊠ γ) are irreducible, so
if we define

                            fe11q (M ) = prλ cosoc Ind(M ⊠ α)
                            fe1q1 (M ) = prλ cosoc Ind(M ⊠ γ)
                            feq11 (M ) = prλ cosoc Ind(M ⊠ α)

then the analogue of proposition 10.1 is that each of these operators takes irreducible
modules to irreducible modules (or zero). Using the exact sequence 0 → γ →
Ind(1 ⊠ 1(1q) ) → α → 0, we see that for m ≥ 2 there is a 4 step filtration of
Ind(N ⊠ q ⊠ Km )

                  0 = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ F2 ⊂ F3 ⊂ F4 = Ind(N ⊠ q ⊠ Km )
                              Representations of Hecke algebras                     33


where
F1 = Ind(N ⊠ Ind(α ⊠ Km−2 )),            F2 /F1 = F3 /F2 = Ind(N ⊠ Ind(γ ⊠ Km−2 )),
                        F4 /F3 = Ind(N ⊠ Ind(α ⊠ Km−2 )).
Arguing as before, one sees that the cosocle of each of these subquotients consists
of a sum of terms with fixed ε1 : respectively ε1 − m is ε1 (N ) − 2, ε1 (N ) − 1, and
ε1 (N ). Hence fe1m feq N , which is a quotient of Ind(N ⊠ q ⊠ Km ), is a quotient of
precisely one of those three subquotients (for m ≥ 2). The rest of the proof is as
before.

                                11. Shapovalov Form
   Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over R, and Proj(A) be the category of
finite dimensional projective A-modules. As HomA (P, −) is an exact functor on
Rep A if P is projective, there is a well defined bilinear form
                        ( ,     ):K(Proj A) ⊗Z K(Rep A) → Z
given by ([P ], [M ]) = dim HomA (P, M ).
   If M is a simple A-module, we write PM for the projective cover of M , so PM is an
indecomposable projective with cosoc(PM ) = M . Then (PM , N ) is the multiplicity
of M in the composition series of N , i.e. (PM , −) = δM :K(A-mod) → Z, and
( , ) defines an isomorphism K(Proj A) −    → K(Rep A)∗ .
   Now consider the natural map
                                K(Proj A) → K(Rep A).
This is an injection if and only if it becomes an isomorphism after tensoring ⊗Z Q,
and this happens precisely when the bilinear form in non-degenerate when restricted
to
                           K(Proj A) ⊗Z K(Proj A) → Z.
                                                                                  λ
We now show this happens for the cyclotomic Hecke algebra. In this section  P Hn
denotes the cyclotomic Hecke algebra only, i.e. λ:µq → Z+ is a function with λi <
∞.
Theorem 11.1. The above pairing (P, P ′ ) 7→ dim Hom(P, P ′ )
                    (   ,     ):K(Rep Hnλ )∗ ⊗Z K(Rep Hnλ )∗ → Z
is a non-degenerate symmetric form.
  We call this form, or the induced form
                            K(Rep Hnλ ) ⊗Z K(Rep Hnλ ) → Q
the Shapovalov form.
   Observe that as e∗i and fi∗ carry projective modules to projective modules, they
act on K(Proj Haλ ). Clearly the action is just the transpose of the action of e∗i and
fi∗ on K(Rep Haλ ). Hence the following lemma is an immediate consequence of the
results of section 9. (We reassure the reader that the results of this section are not
used in the proof of theorem 9.15).
Lemma 11.2. Let N be an irreducible Haλ -module, and set ε = εi (N ), ϕ = ϕi (N ).
Then

 (ii) If n > ε, e∗i (n) PN =       Q:εi (Q)≥n>ε   αQ Peeni Q for some αQ ∈ N.
                                 λ
Proof. If S is an irreducible Ha−ε  -module, then dim Hom(e∗i (ε) PN , S) = dim
           ∗ (ε)
Hom(PN , fi S) is clearly zero unless ϕi (S) ≥ ε. So we may assume S = eeεi Q,
where Q is an irreducible Haλ -module, and then
                  aQ = dim Hom(e∗i (ε) PN , eeεi Q) = dim Hom(PN , fi∗ (ε) eeεi Q).
                                 P
But fi∗ (ε) eeεi Q = ϕi (Q)+ε
                         ε     Q + εi (M)<εi (Q) αM M , by proposition 9.8.
    Now suppose that εi (Q) = ε = εi (N ). Then the terms M in the above sum have
εi (M ) < ε, so none are isomorphic to N . It follows that if εi (Q) = ε, aQ = 0 unless
Q = N , and aN = ϕ+ε      ε . The lemma is immediate.

We now prove the theorem.

Proof. We may suppose that projective covers of irreducible modules in K(Rep Haλ′ )
are linearly independent for a′ < a, and that a > 0. Suppose we have a relation
                                  X
                                      cM P M = 0

in K(Rep Haλ ) with not all the cM equal to zero. Choose an i ∈ µq and a simple
module N such that cN 6= 0, and ε = εi (N ) is maximal among terms in this sum.
We may choose i ∈ µq so that ε > 0, as for a module N , εi (N ) = 0 for all i ∈ µq
                  Hλ
implies that ResHaλ      N = 0, which is absurd for a > 0.
                   a−1

     Now apply e∗i (ε) to this sum. By the lemma, we get an equality
                            X ε + ϕi (N )
                                              cN Peeεi N + X = 0
                                        ε
                         N :εi (N )=ε

             λ
in K(Rep Ha−ε   ), where X is a sum of terms of the form Peeεi Q , with Q ∈ Repq Haλ
and εi (Q) > ε. In particular, all the terms in the sum are distinct projective
                   λ
modules in Rep Ha−ε   . By our inductive assumption these terms are linearly inde-
pendent, hence X = cN = 0. This contradicts our choice of cN , and shows the
Shapovalov form is non-degenerate.
   It remains to show it is symmetric. Again, induct on a. Clearly the form is
symmetric on K(Rep H0λ ), and (fi∗ x, y) = (x, e∗i y) = (e∗i y, x) = (y, fi∗ x) where we
have used adjunction twice, and the inductive hypothesis. So the form is symmetric
on the image of 1λ under the operators e∗i (n) and fi∗ (n) . We must merely show that
this is everything. This follows from the following two lemmas.

Lemma 11.3. Let N be an irreducible Haλ -module, and set ε = εi (N ), ϕ = ϕi (N ).
Then
                               P

 (ii) If n > ϕ, then fi PN = Q:ϕi (Q)≥n>ϕ αQ Pfen Q for some coefficients αQ ∈
                                                      i
      N.
     We omit the proof.
Lemma 11.4. Every PN ∈ K(Proj Haλ ) can be written as a sum of monomial
words in fi∗ (n) with integer coefficients.

Proof. Again, we assume the result for a′ < a, and suppose a > 0. Fix i ∈ µq , and
r > 0, and suppose the result is true for all irreducible N with ϕi (N ) > r > 0. As
there are finitely many irreducible modules in Rep Hnλ , our induction on r starts
successfully, somewhere. Let M be irreducible, and εi (M ) = r. Apply the above
lemma to N = eeri M , to get
                                                X
                       PM = fi∗ (r) Peeri M −         aQ Pfer Q
                                                                         i
                                                      Q:ϕi (Q)>r

which by induction is of the desired form. Arguing in this way for each i ∈ µq ,
we see the result is true except perhaps for modules N for which ϕi (N ) = 0 for
                                                     Hλ
all i ∈ µq . Such a module would have IndHa+1
                                          λ   N = 0, which is absurd. Hence the
                                          a
result is true for all modules.

                   12. Relations in the Grothendieck group
   We show the operators e∗i , fi∗ , h∗i acting on the Grothendieck group of modules
for the cyclotomic and affine Hecke algebras satisfy the defining relations of sl  b ℓ.
This is not true before passage to the Grothendieck group. We know of several
proofs of this result. Aside from the one given here, another would be to simply
compute explicitly the action of e∗i and fi∗ on a suitable basis of K(Repλq ). Such a
basis is given by the Specht modules, first defined by Ariki and Koike.
   In order to do this, one must (i) define these modules, (ii) show they span
the Grothendieck group K(Repλq ), and (iii) explicitly compute e∗i and fi∗ on these
modules. This requires quite some work (of a combinatorial nature) which can,
however, be found in the literature.
   In the approach below, we derive the defining relations for sl b ℓ from our general
theory (which is built from an explicit study of the representations of Hnaff , n ≤
4). As a consequence we rederive and explain these properties of Specht modules,
obtaining a conceptual explanation for their combinatorics: it is just a realization
of the crystal graph.
Proposition 12.1. The operators e∗i :K(Repλq ) → K(Repλq ), e∗i :K(Repaff       q ) →
K(Repaff
       q ) satisfy the Serre relations; i.e. if i, j ∈ µq , ij −1
                                                                  =
                                                                  6 q ±1
                                                                         , then  as op-
erators on the Grothendieck group
                            e∗i e∗j = e∗j e∗i : K(Repλq ) → K(Repλq ).
If ij −1 = q ±1 , and q 6= q −1 , then
                    e∗i 2 e∗j + e∗j e∗i 2 = 2e∗i e∗j e∗i : K(Repλq ) → K(Repλq ).
If ij −1 = q and q = q −1 = −1 then
            e∗i 3 e∗j + 3e∗i e∗j e∗i 2 = 3e∗i 2 e∗j e∗i + e∗j e∗i 3 : K(Repλq ) → K(Repλq ).
Proof. This reduces to checking the result on irreducible modules for H2aff (if ij −1 6=
q ±1 ), H3aff (if ij −1 = q ±1 , and q 6= q −1 ), and H4aff (in the remaining case). To see
this, observe that as e∗i commutes with ev∗ :K(Repλq ) → K(Repaff                      ∗
                                                                            q ), and ev is
                                                 ∗                                     aff
injective, it is enough to check that the ei satisfy the Serre relations on K(Repq ).
But, as observed in 8.1, e∗i is just the component Id ⊗ δqi J1 of ∆n,1 and ∆ is
coassociative. So it is enough to check the relations involving a word of length k in
the e∗i ’s on Hkaff .
36                                             I. Grojnowski


  We must now check the Serre relations for the irreducible Hnaff -modules, n ≤ 4.
These modules were listed in section 6; and the relations follow by examining each
module individually.


Remark 6. The argument reducing the proposition to a case by case check sounds
simpler if phrased in terms of K(Repaff ∗
                                    q ) —algebras are easier to think with than
                                                                            aff
coalgebras. It becomes even clearer when stated explicitly: Let M ∈ Rep Hn+2    .

Consider e∗i e∗j (M ). This is −

H2aff -module. The image on e∗i e∗j (M ) in the Grothendieck group depends only on
the value of the exact functor

                                       m,m

on the pieces Nα ⊠ Γα , and this functor depends only on Γα . As e∗j e∗i has a similar
description, acting on the pieces Nα ⊠ Γα by some other functor depending only on
Γα , it suffices to check equality on H2aff -modules. And again, as these functors on
H2aff are exact, it suffices to check equality on simple modules.

Remark 7. In fact, the Serre relations are a formal consequence of the following
(see section 3.3.3 of [Kac]): (i) The relations [e∗i , fj∗ ] = δij h∗i and [h∗i , e∗j ] = cij e∗j ,
proved below, (ii) the Shapovalov form of section 11 is non-degenerate, and (iii)
                S
the union Repλq = Repaff          q . (This last condition ensures that the Serre relations
hold not just as operators on the irreducible module K(Repλq ), but also on the
module K(Repaff      q ).) This is no simplification, as the proof we have chosen to give
of [h∗i , e∗j ] = cij e∗j essentially consists of verifying a more precise form of the Serre
relations.

Corollary 12.2. The operators fi∗ :K(Repλq ) → K(Repλq ) satisfy the Serre rela-
tions.

Proof. It is enough to show they satisfy the Serre relations as maps from K(Repλq )Q
→ K(Repλq )Q . But the Shapovalov form of section 11 is non-degenerate, and fi∗ is
adjoint to e∗i with respect to this form. As the e∗i satisfy the Serre relations, so do
the fi∗ .

                                    (n)∗
Proof. As before, to check n!ei   = e∗i n , it suffices to check on simple Hnaff -modules.
Both left and right hand sides are zero on all simple Hnaff -modules except q i Kn ,
                                   (n)∗
where both are n!. This implies n!fi      = fi∗ n , by an argument similar to the above
one.

As e∗i is a refined version of restriction, and fi∗ is a refined variant of induction, the
next theorem should be regarded as a sharpening of (7). The proof will occupy the
rest of this section.

Theorem 12.4. [e∗i , fj∗ ] = δij h∗i :K(Repλq ) → K(Repλq ).
   We begin by showing
Proposition 12.5. Suppose M is an irreducible Hnλ -module. Then [e∗i , fi∗ ](M ) is
a multiple of M , and [e∗i , fj∗ ](M ) = 0 if i 6= j.
Proof. For m ≫ 0 we have a surjection
                             Ind(M ⊠ q j Jm ) ։ fj∗ M → 0.
Apply pr e∗i . As e∗i is exact, and pr is right exact, we still get a surjection
                          pr e∗i Ind(M ⊠ q j Jm ) ։ e∗i fj∗ M → 0.
But by the Mackey formula, we have an exact sequence
            0 → δij mM → e∗i Ind(M ⊠ q j Jm ) → Ind(e∗i M ⊠ q j Jm ) → 0,
and hence, as M is irreducible, an exact sequence
                 0 → δij m′ M → pr e∗i Ind(M ⊠ q j Jm ) → fj∗ e∗i M → 0
for some m′ ≤ m, if m ≫ 0. Hence
(8)                         δij m′ M + fj∗ e∗i M ≥ e∗i fj∗ M ≥ 0
where we write A ≥ B if for each irreducible N , the multiplicity [N : A] of N in A
is not less than the multiplicity [N : B] of N in B. Sum (8) over i, j ∈ µq , we get
                              Hλ          Hλ              Hλ          Hλ

                                                                 λ   M

   Next we claim that in K(Repλq )

                                                                     λ   M.

Granting this for the moment, let N be an irreducible               Hnλ -module
                                                                              with N 6= M .
Then comparing the multiplicity of N in (10) and in (8), we see that all inequalities
in (8) must be equalities, and so the multiplicity of N in fj∗ e∗i M equals the mul-
tiplicity of N in e∗i fj∗ M ; so [e∗i , fj∗ ](M ) is a multiple of M . Furthermore, if i 6= j
then the multiplicity of M in fj∗ e∗i M and e∗i fj∗ M is zero, as the central characters
of M and fj∗ e∗i M differ.

   So to prove the proposition it remains to show (10). This is immediate from the
Mackey formula for Hnλ . A weak form of this may be immediately deduced from
the Mackey formula for Hnaff ; we omit further details.
     For N an irreducible Hnλ -module, write wti (N ) = ϕi (N ) − εi (N ), and
                                    X
                           wt(N ) =     wti (N )Λi : µq → Z.
Define a function δi :Rn → N by
                         δi (s1 , . . . , sn ) = #{a | 1 ≤ a ≤ n, sa = i},
and set wti (s) = −2δi (s) + δqi (s) + δq−1 i (s). Recall αi = 2Λi − Λqi − Λq−1 i .
   The following theorem which is a summary of the results of section 10, tells us
that both εi (N ) and ϕi (N ) may be read off the spectrum of N , and that their
difference wti (N ) depends only on the central character of N .
Theorem 12.6. Let N be an irreducible Hnλ -module with central character s. Then
  (i) wt(fei N ) = wt(N ) − αi , if fei N 6= 0.
 (ii) wti (1λ ) = λi , where 1λ is the irreducible H0λ -module.
(iii) wti (N ) = ϕi (N ) − εi (N ) = λi + wti (s).
Proof. As every irreducible module is obtained from 1λ by a sequence of raising
operators fek , it is clear that (i) and (ii) are equivalent to           Q (iii). (ii) is immediate
from the definition of fi∗ and the description H1λ = R[x]/ (x − q i )λi . So we prove
(i).
    We first observe that as N = eei fei N if fei N 6= 0, we have wti (fei N ) = wti (N ) − 2.
                                                 / {qi, i, q −1 i}, for such j wti (fej N ) = wti (N ),
Further, as [e∗j , fi∗ ] = 0 = [fj∗ , fi∗ ] if j ∈
in agreement with (i). Hence for q 6= −1, the content of the theorem is the assertion
                       wti (feqi N ) = wti (N ) + 1,             if    feqi N 6= 0.
This is immediate from proposition 10.4. Likewise, if q = −1, proposition 10.5 is
equivalent to the assertion of the theorem.
We are now in a position to finish the proofs of theorem 9.15 and theorem 12.4. For
M an irreducible module, let ϕ  ei (M ) be the integer defined in theorem 9.15. Then
by theorem 9.15 (iii),
                 X                 X
                       ei (M ) =
                       ϕ                dim Hom(fi∗ M, fj∗ M )
                      i∈µq              i,j∈µq
                                          X
                                    =            dim Hom(M, e∗i fj∗ M )
                                        i,j∈µq
                                                               Hλ         Hλ
                                    = dim Hom(M, ResHn+1
                                                     λ   IndHn+1
                                                             λ   M)
                                                                 n          n

and by (10), this is                      X             X
                                      ≤          λi +       εi (M ).
But ϕei (M ) ≥ ϕi (M ) for all i ∈ µq , by the last paragraph of theorem 9.15, and by
theorem 12.6 (iii)          X         X
                                 λi =     (ϕi (M ) − εi (M )) .
It follows that
           X       X                       X                   X
              λi =   (ϕi (M ) − εi (M )) ≤    e ) − εi (M )) ≤
                                             (ϕ(M                λi ,

and hence all the inequalities above are equalities. In particular ϕ

completing the proof of theorem 12.4.

   To finish verifying the defining relations of sl
12.4 immediately implies
Lemma 12.7. [h∗i , e∗j ] = cij e∗j ,   [h∗i , fj∗ ] = −cij fj∗ :K(Repλq ) → K(Repλq ), where
cij = 2δij − δi,qj − δqi,j is the Cartan matrix of sl  b ℓ.


Remark 8. M. Vazirani has recently improved on theorem 12.4 by determining
the relation between e∗i fi∗ M and fi∗ e∗i M for M irreducible, before passage to the
Grothendieck group. Her results extend and clarify theorems 9.15(iii) and 9.13(iii).

                          13. Uniqueness of the crystal
     In this section we determine the crystal graph of K(Repaff     q ). This admits many
different combinatorial descriptions, each of which it is possible to interpret Hecke-
theoretically. Rather than do this, we prove one more property of the crystal
Baff of K(Repaff  q ). This property (proposition 13.1), together with what we have
proved earlier, is already sufficiently strong to show combinatorially the uniqueness
of the crystal. In fact other than 13.1, all we need is that the crystals Bλ admit a
description purely in terms of the crystal Baff and the involution on Baff induced
by the antiautomorphism σ ∗ .
     Recall that we write ee∧i = σ e
                                    ∗
                                      ei σ ∗ , and also define e∗i ∧ = σ ∗ e∗i σ ∗ and fei∧ =
σ ∗ fei σ ∗ .

Proposition 13.1. Let M be an irreducible HM   -module, and write c = ε∧
                                                                       i (M )
              ∧ e          ∧
 (i) Suppose εi (fi M ) = εi (M ). Then

                                  e∧
                                 (ei ) (fi M ) = fi (ei

 (ii) If ε∧  e         ∧
                                        e∧  e
          i (fi M ) = εi (M ) + 1, then e i fi M = M .

Proof. (i) We have M = (fei∧ )c N = cosoc Ind(q i Kc ⊠ N ), where N is an irreducible
Hnaff module with ε∧ i (N ) = 0.
   Set Qa = (e∗i ∧ )c−a fei M , so that in the Grothendieck group Qa is some number
                  c−a e
              e∧
of copies of (ei )   fi M plus terms with strictly smaller ε∧ i . In particular we have
      ∧                                                                            ce
that εi (A) ≤ a for all A that occur in Qa , and Q0 is just some copies of (e e∧i ) fi M .
   We will show by decreasing induction on a that there is a non-zero map
                           γa : Ind(q i Ka ⊠ N ⊠ q i J1 ) → Qa .

If a = c, Qa = fei M = cosoc Ind(M ⊠ q i J1 ) is a quotient of Ind(q i Kc ⊠ q i J1 ) so our
                                                                      a+n−1
induction starts. Now suppose γa exists, and a ≥ 1. Consider Res1,a+n        Ind(q i Ka ⊠
      i
N ⊠q J1 ). By the Mackey formula, this has a three step filtration 0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ F2 ⊂ F3

with successive quotients
     F1 = Ind1,a+n        a,n,1       i          i
             1,a−1,n,1 Res1,a−1,n,1 (q Ka ⊠ N ⊠ q J1 ),

                 F2 /F1 = Ind1,a+n    w   a,n,1       i          i
                             1,a,n−1,1 Resa,1,n−1,1 (q Ka ⊠ N ⊠ q J1 ),

                                                          F3 /F2 = Ind1,a+n   i      i
                                                                      1,a,n (q J1 ⊠ q Ka ⊠ N ),
where w is the obvious permutation.
   As γa 6= 0, Frobenius reciprocity gives a copy of q i Ka ⊠ N ⊠ q i J1 in the image
of γa , and so
               γ̃a := e∗i ∧ γa : e∗i ∧ Ind(q i Ka ⊠ N ⊠ q i J1 ) → e∗i ∧ Qa = Qa−1
is non-zero. Suppose that γ̃a is zero when restricted to the q i -eigenspace of X1
on F1 . As there is no q i -eigenspace of X1 on F2 /F1 , we must have a non-zero
homomorphism from F3 /F2 to Qa−1 , i.e. a non-zero homomorphism
                                  Ind(q i Ka ⊠ N ) → Qa−1 .
But ε∧               i                     ∧
       i (cosoc Ind(q Ka ⊠ N )) = a > εi (A), for any constituent A of Qa−1 . So
this is not possible, and it must be that γ̃a restricts to a non-zero homomorphism
on the q i -eigenspace of X1 on F1 . As e∗i ∧ (q i Ka ) has a filtration with subquotients
q i Ka−1 , there must be a non-zero map γa−1 : Ind(q i Ka−1 ⊠ N ⊠ q i J1 ) → Qa−1 .
    We now take a = 0 and conclude there is a non-zero homomorphism
                                 γ0 : Ind(N ⊠ q i J1 ) → Q0 ,
hence fei (e
           e∧  c        e                      i
            i ) M = fi N = cosoc Ind(N ⊠ q J1 ) is a subquotient of Q0 . But Q0 is a

multiple of (e e∧i ) fi M , so we have indeed shown that fi (e i      e∧
                                                                       i ) fi M .
                               e∧ c
   (ii) Again write N = (fi ) M . As multiplication is commutative in the bialgebra
K(Repaff             i             i              i      i                 i
        q ), Ind(q Kc ⊠ N ⊠ q J1 ) equals Ind(q Kc ⊠ q J1 ⊠ N ) = Ind(q Kc+1 ⊠ N )
in the Grothendieck group. Hence Ind(q i Kc ⊠ N ⊠ q i J1 ) is (fei∧ )c+1 N = fei∧ M
plus terms A with ε∧                            i            i                  e
                          i (A) ≤ c. As Ind(q Kc ⊠ N ⊠ q J1 ) surjects onto fi M , if
 ∧ e                                   e∧      e
εi (fi M ) = c + 1 it must be that fi M = fi M .
   This is the last property we will need of the representations of the affine Hecke
algebra. The next proposition is a formal consequence of what we have already
proved.
   For M an irreducible Hnaff -module with central character s, define
                                         wt′i (M ) = wti (s).

Also define (ei )

Proof. Let λ : µq → N be such that        λi < ∞, and suppose N ∈ Rep Haλ . Then
corollary 9.14 tells us that k = ϕi (N ) means

and that theorem 12.6 shows that ϕi (N ) = λi + εi (N ) + wt′i (N ).
    Take N = eem   i M , where m = εi (M ), and define λ(y) : µq → N by setting
λi (y) = ε∧i (N ) + y, and setting λj (a) to be any integer much greater than m + y + a,
when j 6= i. It then follows from the previous paragraph applied to λ(0), λ(1), . . .

                        s − εi (N ) − wti (N ),     s ≥ εi (N ) + εi (N ) + wti (N )

i.e. that ε∧                 ∧

                                        i (M ). But wti (N ) = wti (M ) + 2m, and so (ii)
                                ′
follows if we show that wti (M )+εi (N )+m < 0 if and only if wt′i (M )+εi (M̄ )+c < 0.
                                        ∧

But wt′i (M ) + ε∧                         ′        ∧                ∧
                    i (N ) + m = max(wti (M ) + εi (N ) + εi (M̄ ), εi (N ) − c), by (i), and
εi (N ) − c ≤ 0 always. Similarly wti (M ) + εi (M̄ ) + c = max(wt′i (M ) + ε∧

εi (M̄ ), εi (M̄ ) − m), and εi (M̄ ) − m ≤ 0 always. Finally, proposition 13.1i shows
that εi (M̄ ) = m if and only if ε∧   i (N ) = c; hence (ii).
    Now (iii) is immediate from (ii) and proposition 13.1.
13.1. Combinatorial consequences. We now show that we have enough prop-
erties to completely describe the tensor category of “integrable lowest weight crys-
tals”, and hence to describe the crystals themselves. We follow [Ka], especially 8.2.
(This is a kind of purely combinatorial Tannakian property.)
   So we recall some ideas of Kashiwara [Ka]. Recall that if B1 and B2 are two
crystals, their tensor product B1 ⊗ B2 is the crystal whose underlying set is B1 × B2
and with                             (
                                       eei b1 ⊗ b2  if ϕi (b1 ) ≥ εi (b2 )
                    e
                    ei (b1 ⊗ b2 ) =
                                       b1 ⊗ e ei b2 if ϕi (b1 ) < εi (b2 )
                                     (
                                       fei b1 ⊗ b2  if ϕi (b1 ) > εi (b2 )
                    fei (b1 ⊗ b2 ) =          e
                                       b1 ⊗ fi b2   if ϕi (b1 ) ≤ εi (b2 )
   Define the crystal Bi , for i ∈ µq , to have underlying set {bi (n) | n ∈ Z} and set
                               (                              (

and write bi = bi (0).

   Recall that a strict embedding of crystals is an injective map ψ : B1 ֒→ B2 such
that ψ commutes with e   ei and fei for all i ∈ µq . Define B∞ to be the same crystal
as Baff , except that we set ϕi (M ) := εi (M ) + wti (s) if M has central character s.
   We can now rephrase proposition 13.2 as
Proposition 13.3. For each i ∈ µq , define a map Ψi : B∞ → B∞ ⊗ Bi by sending
M to (e∗i ∧ )c (M )⊗ feic bi , where c = ε∧
                                          i (M ). Then Ψi is a strict embedding of crystals.

    It is a result of Kashiwara that this determines the crystal B∞ (see [Ka] and
proposition 3.2.3 of [KS]). For the convenience of the reader we reproduce the
argument. Choose a sequence (i1 , i2 , . . . ) in µq so that each i ∈ µq appears infinitely
often. Define a map Φn : B∞ → B∞ ⊗ Bin ⊗ · · · ⊗ Bi1 by Φn = Ψin ◦ · · · ◦ Ψi1 .
Then for any b ∈ B∞ there exists an n such that Φn (b) = b0 ⊗ feiann bin ⊗ · · · ⊗ feia11 bi1 .
The sequence (a1 , a2 , · · · , an , 0, 0, · · · ) does not depend on n. This embeds B∞ as
the smallest subcrystal of BKas containing (0, 0, · · · ), where we define BKas to be
the crystal whose underlying set is the set of sequences {(ai ) ∈ Z | ai = 0 for i ≫
0}, and whose crystal structure is defined by sending (a1 , . . . , an , 0, . . . ) to · · · ⊗
bi2 (−ai2 ) ⊗ bi1 (−ai1 ). Hence B∞ is completely determined by the Dynkin diagram
µq , as BKas is.

                               14. Reaping the harvest
    In this section we summarise the theorems of the previous sections and identify
the Hopf algebra K(Repaff                              λ
                          q ) and its comodules K(Repq ). As a consequence of this
rigid structure, we obtain a parameterization of irreducible modules for Hnaff and
Hnλ over any field R that depends only on n, λ and ℓ = |µq | (and not on R, or
even the characteristic of R). We observe that the crystal graph of Bλ we have
defined coincides with the crystal graph defined by Kashiwara and Lusztig. We
emphasise that there is no further Hecke theoretic content in the parameterisation
of representations—any of the many combinatorial descriptions of the crystal basis
gives a combinatorial parameterisation of Bλ . Thus we can label modules by tu-
ples of partitions, or Littelmann paths, or paths in a perfect crystal, for example.
The identification of this with Deligne-Langlands parameters [KL, G] is a pleasant
exercise.
                                                                          (n)∗  (n)∗

on K(Repq ) . The module K(Repq ) is a Z-form of the irreducible integrable lowest
weight module for sl b ℓ with lowest weight λ (and lowest weight vector 1λ ). Under
this identification, the Shapovalov form on the module becomes the form of section
11.

realisation of the basic representation, i.e. the identification of this with the Hopf
algebra Z[xi | ℓ . i].

Theorem 14.3. The crystal graph of the sl               q
defined in section 9.
   We prove theorems 14.1 and 14.2 simultaneously.
                                                                     (n)   (n)    
   Step 1: As K(Repλq )∗ is a torsion-free Z-module, and ei , fi , hni are well
defined operators which are determined by the actions of ei , fi and hi , it is enough
to check that the defining relations on ei , fi , hi are satisfied. This was done in the
last section, and so we have a well defined action of UZ sl   b ℓ on K(Repλ )∗ . Similarly,
                                                                              q
we have a well defined bialgebra morphism UZ ηℓ → K(Repaff         q  )∗
                                                                         .
   Step 2: The map UZ ηℓ → K(Repaff      ∗
                                      q ) is surjective. This follows from lemma 11.4,
which is precisely the statement that the map UZ ηℓ → K(Repλq )∗ is surjective, and
the fact that every irreducible Hnaff -module is a Hnλ module for some λ.
   Step 3: We show K(Repλq )∗Q is the irreducible sl     b ℓ -module with lowest weight
                 λ ∗
λ. But K(Repq )Q is a UQ sl  b ℓ -module on which ei and fi act locally nilpotently
(theorems 9.13 and 9.15), and on which hi acts semisimply. By step 2 it is generated
by 1λ as a UZ ηℓ -module. Hence it is an irreducible integrable lowest weight module.
By theorem 12.6 (ii) this weight is λ.
   Step 4: Finally we show the map UZ ηℓ → K(Repaff          ∗
                                                        q ) is injective. Let x be in its
kernel. As the action of UZ ηℓ on K(Repq ) factors through K(Repaff
                                           λ ∗                                  ∗
                                                                             q ) , x acts as
zero on every K(Repλq )∗ hence on every integrable lowest weight module. It follows
that x = 0.
   This concludes the proof of theorems 14.1 and 14.2. Theorem 14.3 follows from
the description of the crystal Baff in section 13, and the fact that the crystal of U η
has the same description [Ka].

14.1. The p-canonical basis. The above theorems prompt the following defini-
tion. Fix a prime p ≥ 0, and a positive integer ℓ.

Definition 1. The p-canonical basis of sl b ℓ is the basis of the module UZ ηℓ given by
the dual of the irreducible Hn -modules, where Hnaff is the affine Hecke algebra over
                              aff

R = Fp , an algebraically closed field of characteristic p, and q ∈ R is a primitive
ℓth root of unity. (If p = 0, take R = C.)
  (If (p, ℓ) 6= 1, we can still define such a basis. The case p = ℓ is explained in the
next section.) This basis has the following pleasant properties, among others.
  (i) The basis of UZ ηℓ descends to give a basis for all integrable lowest weight
      modules.
 (ii) The structure constants of ei and fi on this basis are non-negative integers.
(iii) The 0-canonical basis is a non-negative integral combination of the p-canonical
      basis, for each prime p.
(iv) The 0-canonical basis is the canonical basis (= global crystal basis) of Lusztig
      and Kashiwara.
   Note that we have given (elementary!) proofs of (i)–(iii) in this paper; property
(iv) is immediate from the Kazhdan-Lusztig description of the affine Hecke alge-
bra in geometric terms and Lusztig’s definition of the canonical basis in terms of
perverse sheaves on quivers; this is explained (tersely) in [G].

   If q = 1 all of the above theorems and constructions go through, without change,
once we make the appropriate definitions.
   Define µq to be the image of Z → R, 1 7→ 1, so ℓ is the characteristic of R,
ℓ ∈ N ∪ {∞}. Instead of the affine Hecke algebra, we work with the degenerate or
                                 gr
graded affine Hecke algebra H n , defined by Drinfeld [D] and Lusztig [L]. This is

                                                λ                       P
R[Sn ]; in general one shows that dimR H n = rn n!, where r =             λi . We define
        gr                               gr
Repq H n to be the subcategory of H n -modules on which X1 acts with eigenvalues
in µq . All other definitions and theorems are as before, once we agree to write the
group law in ImZ = µq multiplicatively, so qi denotes what is usually written i + 1.
No changes are necessary in the proofs.
   In particular, take R = Fp , to see that sl  b p controls the representation theory of
the symmetric group in characteristic p.
