                                                      Abstract. Consider the character of an irreducible admissible representation
                                                      of a p-adic reductive group. The Harish-Chandra-Howe local expansion ex-
                                                      presses this character near a semisimple element as a linear combination of
                                                      Fourier transforms of nilpotent orbital integrals. Under mild hypotheses, we
                                                      describe an explicit region on which the local character expansion is valid. We
                                                      assume neither that the group is connected, nor that the underlying field has
                                                      characteristic zero.




                                                                                  0. Introduction
                                                Let G denote the group of k-points of a reductive k-group G, where k is a
                                             nonarchimedean local field. To simplify the present discussion, assume for now that
                                             G is connected and that k has characteristic zero. Let (π, V ) denote an irreducible
                                             admissible representation of G. Let dg denote a fixed Haar measure on G, and let
                                             Cc∞ (G) denote the space of complex-valued, locally constant, compactly supported
                                             functions on G. The distribution character Θπ of π is the map Cc∞ (G) → C
                                             given by Θ R π (f ) := tr π(f ), where π(f ) is the (finite-rank) operator on V given by
                                             π(f )v := G f (g)π(g)v dg. From Howe [12] and Harish-Chandra [9], the distribution
                                             Θπ is represented by a locally constant function on the set of regular semisimple
                                             elements in G. We will denote this function also by Θπ .
                                                For any semisimple γ ∈ G, the local character expansion about γ (see [11] and
                                             [10]) is the identity
                                                                                             X
                                                                              Θπ (γ e(Y )) =    cO µ̂O (Y ),
                                                                                                O
                                             valid for all regular semisimple Y in the Lie algebra m of the centralizer of γ such
                                             that Y is close enough to 0. Here, the sum is over the set of nilpotent orbits O in m;
                                             µ̂O is the function that represents the distribution that is the Fourier transform of
                                             the orbital integral µO associated to O; cO = cO,γ (π) ∈ C; and e is the exponential
                                             map, or some suitable substitute.
                                                This is a qualitative result, in the sense that it gives no indication of how close
                                             Y must be to 0 in order for the identity to be valid. Many questions in harmonic
                                             analysis on G require more quantitative versions of such qualitative results. As
                                             an example of a quantitative result, DeBacker [6] has determined (under some
                                             hypotheses on G) a neighborhood of validity for the local character expansion near
                                             the identity, thus verifying a conjecture of Hales, Moy, and Prasad (see [15]).

   In this paper, we generalize DeBacker’s result for any semisimple γ ∈ G satisfying
mild tameness hypotheses. (See §8 for the hypotheses, and Corollary 12.10 for a
precise statement of the main result.) When γ is regular, we recover a generalization
of Theorem 19 of [13].
   We have taken care not to assume that k has characteristic zero (though some of
our hypotheses do indeed restrict the characteristic of k). The general philosophy is
that whatever is true in characteristic zero should be true in large enough positive
characteristic. DeBacker’s results on homogeneity [6] do not assume characteristic
zero. Rather, he keeps careful track of which specific hypotheses are necessary
in order to make each step of his proof valid. (Previously, the validity of the
local character expansion was unknown in positive characteristic.) We have done
likewise.
   We have also taken care not to assume that G is connected. Nonconnected
groups are of interest for several reasons, one of which is that their characters are
equivalent to twisted characters of connected groups. In order to handle this case,
we need to know that characters are represented by locally constant functions on
the regular set. All proofs of this result that are known to us assume either that k
has characteristic zero or that G is connected. But it is not difficult to show that
the result is true generally. We include the details in §13.
   Note that Theorem 2.1.5(3) of [6] plays a key role in our proof.

                         1. Notation and conventions
   Let k denote a nonarchimedean local field, and let ν denote a discrete valuation
on k. For any algebraic extension field E of k, ν extends uniquely to a valuation
(also denoted ν) of E. Fix a complex-valued, additive character Λ on k that is
nontrivial on the ring R of integers in k and trivial on the prime ideal of R.
   For a reductive k-group G, let G◦ denote its connected part, and let g denote
its Lie algebra. Let g∗ denote the dual of g. Let G = G(k), the group of k-rational
points of G; and let g = g(k) and g∗ = g(k)∗ . Let ZG denote the center of G.
   We use similar notation and font conventions for other groups. That is, given a
group M, we have m, M , etc.
   Let Ad (resp. ad) denote the adjoint or coadjoint representation of G (resp. g)
on g or g∗ . Let Int denote the conjugation action of G on itself. For an element or
subset S in G and an element or subset L in g or g∗ (resp. G), we will sometimes
write S L instead of Ad(S)L (resp. Int(S)L).
   An element g ∈ G is semisimple if Ad(g) is a semisimple linear transformation
of g. When g ∈ G◦ , this is equivalent to g belonging to a torus. For a subset S
of G, let S ss denote the set of semisimple elements in S (so S ss = S ∩ Gss ). An
element g ∈ G is regular semisimple if the coefficient of tn in det(t − 1 + Ad(g)) is
nonzero (where n is the rank of the component gG◦ in G; see [5]). We denote the
set of regular semisimple elements in G by Greg . Similarly we say that an element
X ∈ g is regular semisimple if the coefficient of tn in det(t − ad(X)) is nonzero. We
denote the set of regular semisimple elements in g by greg .
   For a subset S of g (resp. G) let [S] denote the characteristic function of S on g
(resp. G).

   Call an element X ∈ g nilpotent if there is some one-parameter subgroup λ of
G defined over k such that limt→0 λ(t) X = 0. Let Ng denote the set of nilpotent
elements in g, and Og (0) the set of nilpotent orbits under the adjoint action of G
on Ng . We will leave out the subscript when it is understood. One can similarly
define a set N ∗ of nilpotent elements in g∗ .
   For any compact group K, let K ∧ denote the set of equivalence classes of irre-
ducible, continuous representations of K. We will not always distinguish between
a representation and its equivalence class. Recall that if K is abelian, then K ∧ is
a group.                   	
   Let Re := R ∪ r+  r ∈ R and extend the ordering on R to one on R   e as follows:
for all r, s ∈ R,
                           r < s+   if and only if r ≤ s;
                         r+ < s+    if and only if r < s;
                         r+ < s     if and only if r < s.
If r ∈ R, define (r+)+ to be r+. There is a natural way to extend the additive
structure on R to an additive structure on R e ∪ {∞}.
   For any k-group G, let X∗ (G) denote the lattice of characters of G. For any
k-torus T in G, let Φ = Φ(G, T) ⊂ X∗ (T) denote the absolute root system of G
with respect to T. We can also interpret Φ as the set of nontrivial eigencharacters
for the adjoint action of T on g.
   Suppose T is maximal in G. If α ∈ Φ, then let Uα denote the root group
corresponding to α. This group need not be defined over k, but is defined over a
splitting field E of T over k. Let g(E)α ⊂ g(E) denote the root space corresponding
to α.
   Let Ψ(G, T) denote the set of affine roots of G with respect to T and ν. If
ψ ∈ Ψ(G, T), let ψ̇ ∈ Φ(G, T) denote the gradient of ψ. We denote the root lattice
in g(E)ψ̇ corresponding to ψ by g(E)ψ [15, 3.2].

                        2. Apartments and buildings.
   For any extension E/k of finite ramification degree, let B(G, E) denote the
extended Bruhat-Tits building of G over E. Note that if E/k is Galois, then
B(G, k) embeds naturally in the set of Gal(E/k)-fixed points of B(G, E), with
equality when E/k is tame (see [17, (5.11)]).
   Every maximal k-split torus S in G has an associated apartment A(S, k) in
B(G, k). Let T be a maximal k-torus in G containing S. Then T splits over some
Galois extension E, so T has an apartment A(T, E) in B(G, E). The Galois fixed
point set of the apartment of T in B(G, E) is the apartment of S in B(G, k) [23,
§2.6].
   Suppose M ⊂ G is an E-Levi k-subgroup (that is, M(E) is a Levi subgroup of
G(E)) for some finite Galois extension E/k. There is a natural family of Gal(E/k)-
equivariant embeddings of B(M, E) into B(G, E). When E/k is tame, this in turn
induces a natural family of embeddings of B(M, k) into B(G, k). (In general, there
is no canonical way to pick a distinguished member of this family. However, all
such embeddings share the same image, and no statement we make will depend on
the choice of embedding.)
   We shall require a generalization of the previous paragraph.

Lemma 2.1. Let γ ∈ Gss and M = CG (γ). Then for every tame extension
E/k of finite ramification degree, we have an M(E)-equivariant, toral embedding
iE : B(M, E) −→ B(G, E). Moreover, these maps can be chosen to be compatible in
the following sense: if E and E ′ are two such fields and E ⊇ E ′ , then the restriction
of iE to B(M, E ′ ) is iE ′ .
Proof. For each Galois extension E/k of finite ramification degree, Theorem 2.2.1
and Lemma 2.3.4 of [14] together provide us with a family IE of toral, M◦ (E)-
equivariant embeddings of B(M◦ , E) = B(M, E) into B(G◦ , E) = B(G, E). More-
over, Gal(E/k) acts on IE . For an embedding f ∈ IE and an element m ∈ M(E),
define m f : B(M, E) → B(G, E) by m f (x) = mf (m−1 x). Since m f = f for all m ∈
M◦ (E), we thus have an action of the compact group M(E)/M◦ (E) ⋊ Gal(E/k).
By the convexity of IE , this action must have fixed points, which then form a family
of toral embeddings that are equivariant under both Gal(E/k) and M(E).
   We now prove the final statement of the lemma. Let E/k be the maximal tame
subextension of a finite extension over which both M◦ and G◦ split. Choose an
embedding iE as in the previous paragraph. For any tame L/E, B(M, E) generates
B(M, L) as an M(L)-space, so our choice of iE determines a choice of iL . Thus,
it will be enough to show compatibility between iL and iL′ for all tame, Galois
L/k and all L ⊇ L′ ⊇ k. The restriction of iL to B(M, L′ ) has image in the set of
Gal(L/L′ )-fixed points of B(G, L). But from [21] or [17], this set is B(G, L′ ). 

                           3. Moy-Prasad filtrations.
   Let T be a maximal k-torus in G with splitting field E over k. Let T(E)0 denote
                                         e define
the parahoric subgroup of T(E). For r ∈ R,
                                                                  	
             t(E)r := X ∈ t(E)  ν(dχ(X)) ≥ r for all χ ∈ X∗ (T)
and for r > 0,
                                                                 	
            T(E)r := t ∈ T(E)0  ν(χ(t) − 1) ≥ r for all χ ∈ X∗ (T) .
                                e Moy and Prasad define lattices g(E)x,r in g(E)
   For each (x, r) ∈ B(G, E) × R,
         ∗           ∗
and g(E)x,r in g(E) . When r ≥ 0, they define a normal subgroup G(E)x,r of the
                                                                              e
parahoric subgroup G(E)x of G(E). In particular, for all x ∈ A(T, E) and r ∈ R,
                                            X
(3.1)                 g(E)x,r = t(E)r ⊕              g(E)ψ
                                          ψ∈Ψ(G,T),ψ(x)≥r

Similarly, G(E)x,r is defined in terms of the filtrations on T(E) and on root groups.
These definitions depend on the normalization of the valuation ν; our normalization
agrees with that of Yu [24]. Thus, for example, for any α ∈ k × , α · gx,r = gx,r+ν(α) .
   However, the definitions do not depend on the choice of T containing x in its
apartment. Note that for all r ∈ R,  e g(E)x,r+ = ∪s>r g(E)x,s and G(E)x,|r|+ =
∪s>|r| G(E)x,s .
   Moy and Prasad also define gx,r and Gx,r (irrespective of whether or not G is
k-split). The above normalization was chosen to have the following property [1,
1.4.1]: when E/k is tame and x ∈ B(G, k), we have
           gx,r = g(E)x,r ∩ g,     and (for r > 0), Gx,r = G(E)x,r ∩ G.
                                                     e let
    We will also use the following notation. For r ∈ R,
            gr = ∪x∈B(G,k) gx,r   and (for r ≥ 0) Gr = ∪x∈B(G,k) Gx,r .

It is proven in [3] that gr (resp. Gr ) is a G-domain: a G-invariant, open and closed
subset of g (resp. G).
    For any x ∈ B(G, k) and any 0 < r ≤ t ≤ 2r, the group (Gx,r /Gx,t ) is abelian.
Under many conditions (for example, if G contains a tamely ramified maximal
torus, or if G is simply connected), there exists a (Gx -equivariant) isomorphism
(see [15] or [24])
(3.2)                          Gx,r /Gx,t ←→ gx,r /gx,t ,
and thus an isomorphism
(3.3)                    (Gx,r /Gx,t )∧ ←→ g∗x,(−t)+ /g∗x,(−r)+ .
Yu [25] has defined a more complicated filtration on T than the one above. Using
this filtration to define Gx,r , he shows that (3.3) is valid for all G. However, for
the groups that we will consider, Yu’s filtration is equivalent to the one above.

                                 4. Singular depth
   From now on, G is a reductive k-group, γ ∈ Gss , and M is the centralizer of γ
in G.
Definition 4.1. For m ∈ M , let s(m) = sG   M (m) := maxα∈Am {0, ν(α − 1)}, where
Am is the set of generalized eigenvalues of the action of Ad(m) on g/m.
Remark 4.2. If G is connected and m is regular, then the definition of s(m) given
above agrees with the definition in [13, §1].
Remark 4.3. Note that s(mz) = s(m) for all z ∈ ZG and that s(hmh−1 ) = s(m)
for all h ∈ M .
Remark 4.4. Suppose m ∈ M , and E/k is an extension that contains all of the
generalized eigenvalues of both Ad(γ) and Ad(m) acting on g/m. Since Ad(γ) and
Ad(m) commute, we can write g(E)/m(E) as a direct sum of subspaces Vi , where
Vi is simultaneously an αi -eigenspace for Ad(γ) and a generalized βi -eigenspace for
Ad(m).
Lemma 4.5. If m ∈ Mrss , then s(m) ≥ r.
Proof. Pick a maximal k-torus T in M with m ∈ T , and a splitting field E for T.
Then
                      m ∈ Mr ∩ T ⊂ M(E)r ∩ T(E) = T(E)r ,
where the last equality follows from Theorem 4.1.5(1) of [7]. Thus, ν(χ(m) − 1) ≥ r
for all χ ∈ X∗ (T). In particular, this is true for all χ ∈ Φ(G, T) ⊂ X∗ (T).    
Lemma 4.6. If m ∈ Ms(γ)+ , then s(γm) = s(γ). If γ is compact mod ZG , then so
is γm, and conversely. If γ is semisimple, then so is γm.
Proof. Let Vi , αi , and βi be as in Remark 4.4. For all i, Lemma 4.5 implies that
ν(βi − 1) > s(γ) ≥ ν(αi − 1), and thus
                                                              
       ν(αi βi − 1) = ν (αi − 1)(βi − 1) − (αi − 1) + (βi − 1) = ν(αi − 1).
Thus, s(γm) = s(γ). The second statement of the lemma follows from the fact that
αi is a unit if and if so is αi βi . If Ad(m) is diagonalizable over some field extension,
then Ad(m) and Ad(γ) are simultaneously diagonalizable, so the last statement
follows.                                                                                

Corollary 4.7. Ms(γ)+ = Ms(γ)+ .
Proof. Let m ∈ Ms(γ)+ . Let Vi , αi , and βi be as in Remark 4.4. As in the proof of
Lemma 4.6, ν(αi βi − 1) = ν(αi − 1) for all i. Thus,

                                  5. Intertwining
Definition 5.1. Let K be a compact open subgroup of G and let d ∈ K ∧ . For
g ∈ G, recall that g d is the representation of gKg −1 given as g d(gkg −1 ) := d(k).
Definition 5.2. If d and d′ are continuous representations of compact subgroups
K and K ′ (respectively) of G, then let [d : d′ ] = dimC HomK∩K ′ (d, d′ ).
Lemma 5.3. Let K and L be compact subgroups of G, and let N be a compact
subgroup of K. Let d ∈ K ∧ and let χ denote a one-dimensional representation of
L. Let d1 ⊕ · · ·⊕ dn be a decomposition of d into representations of N . If 0 6= [χ : d]
then for some di , 0 6= [χ : di ].
                                              P
Proof. We have 0 < [χ : d] ≤ [χ : d|N ] = i [χ : di ]. Therefore, [χ : di ] > 0 for
some i.                                                                                

                                 6. Partial traces
   From now on, let (π, V ) denote an irreducible admissible representation of G.
Let Θπ denote the distribution character of π. This distribution is represented by
a locally constant function (also denoted Θπ ) on Greg (see §13). Let ρ(π) denote
the depth of π [15, §5].
   For any irreducible representation d of a compact open subgroup K, let Vd denote
the (K, d)-isotypic subspace of V . Let Ed denote the K-equivariant projection from
V to Vd . Define the distribution Θd by Θd (F ) := tr(Ed π(F ) Ed ) for all F ∈ Cc∞ (G).
Then Θd , which can be thought of as the ‘partial trace of π with respect to d’, is
represented by the locally constant function Θd (x) := tr(Ed π(x) Ed ) on G. It
follows from the definitions that
                                X
(6.1)                Θπ (F ) =      Θd (F ) for all F ∈ Cc∞ (G).
                               d∈K ∧

Note that for each fixed F , π(F ) has finite rank, so all but finitely many terms in
this sum vanish.
Lemma 6.2.         (1) If x ∈ G and k ∈ K, then Θd (kxk −1 ) = Θd (x).

    (2) If h ∈ ker(d), then Θd (xh) = Θd (x).
Proof. The first statement is [13, Lemma 14]. Since π(h)Ed = Ed , we have
            Θd (xh) = tr(Ed π(x)π(h) Ed ) = tr(Ed π(x) Ed ) = Θd (x).     
                                                                 ∧
   Let N be a compact open subgroup of K, and let d ∈ K . Considered as a repre-
sentation of N , d decomposes into a finite sum of distinct irreducible representations
di with multiplicities αi :
                                 α1 d1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ αn dn .
For each i, let Vd,di denote the (N, di )-isotypic subspace of Vd . Let Ed,di denote
the N -equivariant projection from V to Vd,di . For x ∈ G, define
                          Θd,di (x) := tr(Ed,di π(x)Ed,di ).
                                      P
Remark 6.3. Note that Θd (x) =          i Θd,di (x). Moreover, Θd,di has invariance
properties analogous to those given for Θd in Lemma 6.2.
Proposition 6.4. Let g ∈ G. If Θd (g) 6= 0, then 0 6= [d : g d]. If Θd,di (g) 6= 0, then
0 6= [di : g di ].
Proof. Define a pairing h , i on Vd with respect to which d is unitary. Let {vj } be
a basis for Vd . For k1 , k2 ∈ K,
                     Θd (k1 xk2 ) = tr(Ed π(k1 xk2 ) Ed )
                                    X
                                  =    hEd π(k1 xk2 )vj , vj i
                                      j
                                    X
                                  =  hπ(k1 )Ed π(x)π(k2 )vj , vj i.
                                      j

Fixing k2 and letting k1 vary, we have a sum of matrix coefficients of d. Note that
by Lemma 6.2(1) we have,
                       Θd (k1 xk2 ) = Θd (k2 k1 xk2 k2−1 )
                                   = Θd (k2 k1 x)
                                     X
                                   =     hπ(k2 )Ed π(k1 x)vj , vj i.
                                          j

Fixing k1 and letting k2 vary, we again have a sum of matrix coefficients of d.
Therefore, our first statement follows from Corollary 14.3 of [10].
   To prove the second statement, note that since Ed,di is a projection onto a
subspace of Vdi , if Θd,di (g) 6= 0, then Θdi (g) 6= 0.                      
Lemma 6.5. Fix i. Let χ be a character of a closed subgroup N ′ of N . Let g ∈ G.
Suppose                       Z
                         0 6=    Θd,di (gn)χ(n) dn .
                                     N′
Then di |N ′ = χ̄.
Proof. For all n ∈ N ′ , π(n)Ed,di acts on Vd,di via the scalar di (n). Let {aj } be
the multi-set of diagonal entries of a matrix that represents, with respect to some
basis, the action of Ed,di π(g) on Vd,di . Then for some j,
                                       Z
                               0 6= aj     di (n)χ(n) dn.

The conclusion then follows from Lemma 14.2 of [10].                                   

                                       7. Harmonic analysis
From distributions on G to distributions on M . For the distribution Θπ (or
any other distribution) on G, we follow Harish-Chandra [10, §18] (see also [20]) to
define a distribution θ on M that captures the behavior of Θπ near γ.
   Fix r ≥ 0. The proof of Proposition 1 of [20] is valid for general reductive
groups, so we may apply it to see that the following (surjective) map is everywhere
submersive:
                                         p
                            G × Mr′ −→ G (γMr′ )
                             (g, m) 7−→ gγmg −1 .
Theorem 7.1. There exists a unique, surjective, linear map
                                Cc∞ (G × Mr′ ) −→ Cc∞ (G (γMr′ ))
                                      α        7−→     fα ,
such that for all F ∈ Cc∞ (G)
               Z                    Z
                   F (x)fα (x) dx =                  F (gγmg −1 )α(g, m) dg dm,
                   G                        G×Mr′

and supp(fα ) ⊂ p(supp(α)).
Proof. This is Theorem 11, p. 49, of [8] applied to the map p above. (Note that
in loc. cit., it is not assumed that the characteristic of k is zero nor that G is
connected.)                                                                     

Remark 7.2. The set G (γMr′ ) is an open (since p is submersive), G-invariant
neighborhood of γ in G, so Cc∞ (G (γMr′ )) ⊂ Cc∞ (G). Note that the set G (γMr ) is
not necessarily open.
  Fix an open compact subgroup K of G; let 1K denote its characteristic function.
We have the following diagram:
                       restr.
       Cc∞ (Mr )       −→       Cc∞ (Mr′ ) −→ Cc∞ (G × Mr′ ) −→ Cc∞ (G (γMr′ ))

           f           7−→         f       7−→            α        7−→            fα
where the first arrow is the restriction map; the second arrow is given by α(g, m) :=
1K (g)f (m); and the third arrow is the map of Theorem 7.1. Note that the support
of fα is contained in K (γMr′ ), an open, K-invariant neighborhood of γ in G.
   Let Θ = Θπ denote the distribution character of (π, V ).
Definition 7.3. Define the distribution θ on Mr by θ(f ) := Θπ (fα ).
Lemma 7.4. Normalize the measure on G so that K has total measure 1. Then
for each f ∈ Cc∞ (Mr )
                               X Z
                       θ(f ) =     Θd (γm)f (m) dm,
                                        d∈K ∧   Mr

where the sum is over a finite set (which depends on f ) of representations.
    Note that a similar statement appears on p. 78 of [10].

Proof. Combine equation (6.1) with

                                Mr

   For the following lemma, note that K (γMr′′ ) is a K-invariant neighborhood of
γ in Greg , and that K (γMr′′ ) is dense in K (γMr′ ) ⊃ supp(fα ). From §13, Θπ is
represented by a locally constant function on Greg .
Lemma 7.5. The distribution θ is represented on Mr′′ by the function θ(m) :=
Θπ (γm).
Proof. For all f ∈ Cc∞ (Mr ), the support of the function fα is a subset of Greg , so
the first integral below makes sense:
                                     Z
                 θ(f ) = Θπ (fα ) :=        Θπ (x)fα (x) dx

                                        8. Hypotheses
   From now on, we will make certain assumptions: Let G, γ, and M be as in §4.
That is, G is a reductive linear algebraic k-group, γ ∈ Gss , and M is the centralizer
of γ in G.
Hypothesis 8.1. The eigenvalues of Ad(γ) belong to a tamely ramified extension
of k.
Hypothesis 8.2. The order of γZG G◦ ∈ G/ZG G◦ is prime to the residue char-
acteristic of k.
  We will use this hypothesis to prove Lemma 9.1. However, there are other
conditions that would also suffice.
Hypothesis 8.3. Using some system of embeddings as in Lemma 2.1 to identify
B(M, E) with a subset of B(G, E) for each tame E/k, we have that for each such
               e and x ∈ B(M, k),
E, and for r ∈ R
     m(E)∗r = m(E)∗ ∩ g(E)∗r                   m(E)∗x,r = m(E)∗ ∩ g(E)∗x,r
     M(E)r = M(E) ∩ G(E)r                      M(E)x,r = M(E) ∩ G(E)x,r        (r > 0).
10                    JEFFREY D. ADLER AND JONATHAN KORMAN


   We will not pursue here the question of when this hypothesis holds. For now,
we note that it holds when one of the following holds for some tame E/k: M◦
is an E-Levi subgroup of G◦ ; M◦ and G◦ are both E-split, and have the same
E-split rank; or G = RE/k H ⋊ Gal(E/k) for some E-group H (where RE/k denotes
restriction of scalars), and γ ∈ Gal(E/k). (See Lemmata 2.2.3 and 2.2.9 of [4].)
Hypothesis 8.4. There is a nondegenerate G-invariant symmetric bilinear form
B on g such that we can identify g∗x,r with gx,r via the map g → g∗ defined by
X 7−→ (Y 7→ B(X, Y )).
   (Groups satisfying this hypothesis are discussed in [2, §4].) Thus, we can (and
eventually will) identify gx,r with g∗x,r and mx,r with m∗x,r
   The following hypothesis concerns the existence of a “mock exponential” map.
Hypothesis 8.5. Let e = max{ρ(π), s(γ)}. There exists a bijection e : ge+ −→
Ge+ such that for all x ∈ B(G, k) and all e < r ≤ s ≤ t ≤ 2s, we have that e
induces the group isomorphism gx,s /gx,t → Gx,s /Gx,t of (3.2). Moreover, for all
s > e, e(ms ) = Ms , and
    (1) for r, s > e, all X ∈ mx,r , and all Y ∈ mx,s , we have e(X) · e(Y ) ≡ e(X + Y )
        modulo Mx,(r+s) ;
    (2) for all m ∈ M we have Int(m) ◦ (e |me+ ) = (e |me+ ) ◦ Ad(m);
    (3) for all x ∈ B(M, k), all s, t ∈ Re with s > e, all Y ∈ gx,s , and all X ∈ gx,t ,
                  e(Y )
        we have         X − X ∈ gx,s+t .
   Note that item (3) in the hypothesis asserts, for all x ∈ B(M, k), a weaker version
of Proposition 1.6.3 of [1], and the remainder of the hypothesis is a weaker version
of Hypothesis 3.2.1 in [6]. Item (1) implies that e carries a Haar measure on m into
a Haar measure on M .
   Mock exponential maps are known to exist in several situations. For example,
for GLn (k), the map X 7→ (1 + X) works. For a classical group that splits over a
tame extension of k, with odd residue characteristic, the Cayley transform works.
If k has characteristic zero and e is sufficiently large, then the exponential map
works.
   We will need the next two hypotheses in order to apply Theorem 11.9.
Hypothesis 8.6. Assume that M satisfies Hypothesis 3.4.3 of [6], concerning the
convergence of nilpotent orbital integrals.
     This is automatically satisfied when k has characteristic zero.
Hypothesis 8.7. Assume that k and M satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1.5(3)
of [6].

                          9. Lie algebra decompositions
Lemma 9.1. Let E/k be a tame extension containing the eigenvalues of Ad(γ).
                             e we have
For all x ∈ B(M, k), and r ∈ R,
                                 M
                       g(E)x,r =   (g(E)x,r ∩ g(E)γ,α ) ,
                                      α

where the sum is over the set of eigenvalues of the action of Ad(γ) on g(E), and
each g(E)γ,α is the associated eigenspace.

Proof. Let n be the order of γZG G◦ ∈ G/ZG G◦ . Then γ n ∈ (ZG )(E)T(E) for
some maximal torus T such that T/Z◦G is E-split. Since γ n acts trivially on t(E)
and acts on each T-root space in g(E), we have from (3.1) that

Lemma 10.1. Let t ∈ R, x ∈ B(M, k), and γ ′ ∈ γMx,s(γ)+. If Z ∈ m⊥ ∩ (gx,−t r
                 ′
gx,(−t)+ ) then γ Z − Z 6∈ gx,(−t+s(γ ′ ))+ .
Proof. Write γ ′ = γm, with m ∈ Mx,s(γ)+ . Let Z ′ = m Z − Z.
   From Hypothesis 8.1,
                      P there is a tame extension
                                         P        E of k containing the eigenvalues
of Ad(γ). Write Z = α Zα , and Z ′ = α Zα′ , where each sum is over the set of
eigenvalues for the action of Ad(γ) on g(E), and each Zα and Zα′ belongs to the
                                   ′         P
corresponding eigenspace. Then γ Z − Z = α Yα , where Yα = αZα′ + (α − 1)Zα .
From our hypothesis on Z, there is some α so that Zα ∈      / g(E)x,(−t)+ . From
Lemma 4.6, s(γ ′ ) = s(γ). Therefore, from Lemma 9.1 it will be enough to show
that Yα ∈/ g(E)x,(−t+s(γ))+ . Note that from Hypothesis 8.5(3), Z ′ ∈ gx,(−t+s(γ))+.
Therefore, Lemma 9.1 implies that Zα′ ∈ g(E)x,(−t+s(γ))+ .
   Suppose ν(α) ≥ 0. Then αZα′ ∈ g(E)x,(−t+s(γ))+ . By the definition of s(γ),
(α − 1)Zα ∈/ g(E)x,(−t+s(γ))+ , and our conclusion follows.
   Now suppose that ν(α) < 0. Let q = ν(α) = ν(α−1). Then αZα′ ∈ g(E)x,(q−t+s(γ))+
and (α − 1)Zα ∈  / g(E)x,(q−t)+ ⊃ g(E)x,(q−t+s(γ))+ , so Yα ∈
                                                            / g(E)x,(q−t+s(γ))+ ⊃
g(E)x,(−t+s(γ))+ .                                                                
Proposition 10.2. Let r ∈ R, x ∈ B(M, k), X ∈ g, and γ ′ ∈ γMx,s(γ)+. Write
                                                               ′
X = Y + Z according to the decomposition in Corollary 9.2. If γ X − X ∈ gx,(−r)+ ,
then Z ∈ gx,(−r−s(γ))+ .
                                                                             ′
Proof. For some t ∈ R, Z ∈ m⊥ ∩ (gx,t r gx,t+ ). By Lemma 10.1, γ Z − Z 6∈
                                            ′                                      ′
gx,(t+s(γ ′ ))+ . On the other hand, since γ X − X ∈ gx,(−r)+ decomposes as (γ Y −
         ′                                                 ′
Y ) + (γ Z − Z) ∈ mx,(−r)+ ⊕ (m⊥ ∩ gx,(−r)+ ), we have γ Z − Z ∈ gx,(−r)+ . Thus
t + s(γ ′ ) > −r, which implies that Z ∈ gx,t ⊆ gx,(−r−s(γ ′ ))+ . Finally, recall from
Lemma 4.6 that s(γ ′ ) = s(γ).                                                        
Proposition 10.3. If x ∈ B(M, k), r ∈ R, and Y ∈ mx,r r mx,r+ , then
           (Y + gx,r+ ) ∩ N =
                            6 ∅    if and only if   (Y + mx,r+) ∩ Nm 6= ∅.
Proof. This follows from Corollary 3.2.6 of [3] and Hypothesis 8.3.                   
Definition 10.4. Let 0 < r ≤ t ≤ 2r. A character d ∈ (Gx,r /Gx,t )∧ is called
degenerate if the coset that corresponds to d under the isomorphism (3.3) contains
nilpotent elements. One can similarly define what it means for a character of
(Mx,r /Mx,t ) to be degenerate.
Lemma 10.5. Let x ∈ B(M, k), q, t ∈ R,     e and suppose 0 < q ≤ t ≤ 2q. Let
                                                    ′
d ∈ (Gx,q /Gx,t )∧ be a character such that [d : γ d] 6= 0 for some γ ′ ∈ γMx,s(γ)+.
Suppose that for some v > q + s(γ), d is trivial on Mx,v . Then d is trivial on Gx,v .
Proof. By (3.3), d corresponds to some coset Υ ∈ g∗x,(−t+) /g∗x,(−q)+ . By Lemma 1.8.1
           ′                                 ′          ′           ′
of [1], Υ ∩ γ Υ 6= ∅. Pick X ∈ Υ such that γ X ∈ Υ ∩ γ Υ. Then γ X − X ∈ g∗x,(−q)+ .
Write X = Y + Z with respect to the decomposition in Corollary 9.2. By Proposi-
tion 10.2, Z ∈ g∗x,(−q−s(γ))+ ⊆ g∗x,(−v)+ . Hence, X + g∗x,(−v)+ = Y + g∗x,(−v)+ . Since
d is trivial on Mx,v , we have that Y ∈ m∗x,(−v)+ . Therefore X ∈ g∗x,(−v)+ , implying
that d is trivial on Gx,v .                                                           
Remark 10.6. In fact, the proof shows that d is trivial on a slightly larger subgroup
that corresponds to the lattice mx,s+ + (m⊥ ∩ gx,s ) (for some s such that mx,s+ =
mx,v ) via (3.2).

                          11. A result of DeBacker
  We recall the following from, for example, §4.1 of [3]. Let dX be a Haar measure
on m. For any Cc∞ (m), we define the Fourier transform fˆ ∈ Cc∞ (m∗ ) of f by
                                  Z
                           ˆ
                          f (χ) =     f (X) · Λ(χ(X)) dX
                                    m

for χ ∈ m . Let dχ be a Haar measure on m∗ . For f ∈ Cc∞ (m∗ ) we use the natural
         ∗

identification of m∗∗ with m and define the Fourier transform fˆ ∈ Cc∞ (m) by
                                   Z
                           fˆ(X) =     f (χ) · Λ(χ(X)) dχ
                                    m∗

for X ∈ m. We normalize the measures dX and dχ so that for X ∈ g and f ∈ Cc∞ (m)

                                   ˆ
(11.1)                            fˆ(X) = f (−X).
   Recall that, from Hypothesis 8.4, we can (and eventually will) identify m with its
linear dual m∗ . With this identification, the Fourier transform becomes a map from
Cc∞ (m) to itself. Given our normalization of measures, we have that for x ∈ B(M, k)
         e [mx,r ]∧ = [m∗
and r ∈ R,                x,(−r)+ ].
   Using r and e as in Hypothesis 8.5, and the distribution θ from Definition 7.3,
we now define a distribution θb on m∗ (compare [6, §2.1]).

   If T is a distribution on m, then we let resD(m)(−r)+ T denote the restriction of
T to D(m)(−r)+ . The following homogeneity result was proved by DeBacker [6,

                                 12. The Main Theorem
     Recall that we are assuming the hypotheses in §8. Let θb be as in definition 11.2.
Theorem 12.1. Let r > max{ρ(π), 2s(γ)}. Then θb ∈ J(m
                                                  e ∗ )(−r)+ .

Proof. It is enough to show that θb ∈ J(m   e ∗ )x,−s,(−r)+ for all x ∈ B(M, k) and
all s, r ∈ R such that s ≥ r. Fix x ∈ B(M, k) and s ≥ r, and take f ∈
C(m∗x,−s /m∗x,(−r)+). Suppose 0 6= θ(fb ). We need to show that supp(f ) ∩ (N ∗ +
                                                                                m
m∗                                   b it suffices to show this for f = [Y + m∗
         ) 6= ∅. By the linearity of θ,                                           ],
 x,(−s)+                                                                             x,(−r)+
where Y ∈ m∗x,−s . In other words, it suffices to show that the character χ :=
e−1 ◦ΛY of Mx,s /Mx,s+ is degenerate, where ΛY := Λ ◦ Y . We have
                                                    X
            fb(W ) = ΛY (W )[mx,r ](W ) = ΛY (W )          [Z](W ).
                                                                   Z∈mx,r /mx,s

            b ) = θ(fb ◦ e−1 ) implies that for some Z ∈ mx,r , 0 6= θ(h), where
Thus 0 6= θ(f
      ∞
h ∈ Cc (Mr ) is defined by h(e(W )) = ΛY (W )[Z + mx,s ](W ). Using Lemma 7.4
with r′ := r − s(γ), we get
                                  X Z
                      0 6= θ(h) =           Θd (γm)h(m) dm.

                                         x,r′


Thus for some d ∈ G∧x,r ′ ,
                   Z                       Z
(12.2)        0 6=        Θd (γm)h(m) dm =                         Θd (γm)h(m) dm,
                       Mr                                   Mx,r

where the last equality holds because h is supported on Mx,r .
   Pick minimal t ∈ R such that d is trivial on Gx,t+ . Let q = max{r′ , ( 2t )+}.
Since q ≥ r′ , one can restrict d to Gx,q . Since the group Gx,q /Gx,t+ is abelian, this
restriction decomposes into a finite sum of irreducible, one-dimensional representa-
tions d1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ dn . From equation (12.2) and Remark 6.3, we see that for some i,
and for all v > s,

Therefore, for some ṅ,

If we assume that v ≥ q, then we may apply Lemma 6.5 to see that di is trivial
on Mx,v . Moreover, (12.3) implies that Θd,di (γ ′ ) 6= 0 for some γ ′ ∈ γMx,s(γ)+,
                                                     ′
which by Proposition 6.4 means that 0 6= [di : γ di ]. If we further assume that
v > q + s(γ), then we may apply Lemma 10.5 to see that di |Gx,v ≡ 1. Since d
is an irreducible representation of Gx,r′ , it follows that Gx,r′ permutes the di ’s
transitively. Therefore, d is trivial on Gx,v , so v > t. Since this is true for all v
satisfying v > s and v > q + s(γ), we see that

(12.4)                           0 < t ≤ max{s, q + s(γ)} .

  We now use this inequality to prove four others:

(12.5)                                         s > ( 2t )+
(12.6)                                      r+s>t
(12.7)                                         s>q
(12.8)                                         s ≥ t.

The first two of these follow trivially from the last. However, we prove them inde-
pendently because we want to isolate the one part of this paper, the proof of (12.8),
that relies on the hypothesis that r > 2s(γ).
     Note that (12.5) is obvious in the case where t ≤ s. So assume that t ≤ q + s(γ).
Recall that q is either r′ or ( 2t )+. If q = r′ , then s ≥ r = q + s(γ) ≥ t > t/2+. If
q = ( 2t )+, then t ≤ ( 2t +) + s(γ). Since t ∈ R, t ≤ t/2 + s(γ), so t/2 ≤ s(γ) < r ≤ s.
Since s ∈ R, we have (12.5).
     To prove (12.6), note that (12.5) implies that s(γ) + s > ( 2t +) + s(γ), so r + s >
( 2t +) + s(γ). Since r + s > r, we have r + s > max{r, 2t + s(γ)+} = q + s(γ). Since
r + s > s, we have r + s > max{s, q + s(γ)} ≥ t.
     To prove (12.7), note that s ≥ r > r′ . From (12.5), we conclude that s >
max{r′ , 2t +} = q.
     To prove (12.8), we use (12.4) to reduce to the case where q + s(γ) ≥ t. If q = r′ ,
then s ≥ r = r′ + s(γ) = q + s(γ) ≥ t. If q = 2t +, then since q + s(γ) ≥ t, we
have s(γ)+ ≥ 2t . Since s(γ) ∈ R, s(γ) ≥ 2t +. Therefore (using the hypothesis that
r > 2s(γ)), we have

          s ≥ r ≥ 2s(γ)+ = (s(γ)+) + s(γ) ≥ ( 2t +) + s(γ) = q + s(γ) ≥ t.

Now let z := e(Z). From (12.6), di is trivial on Mx,r+s . Apply Hypothesis 8.5(1)
together with Remark 6.3 to obtain:

From (12.7) and Lemma 6.5, 0 6= [χ̄ : di ]. From (12.8), di is trivial on Gx,s+ .
By Remark 10.6, the restriction d˜ of di to Gx,s is represented by a coset Y +
g∗x,(−s)+ where Y ∈ m∗x,−s . Since s > ρ(π), Theorem 3.5 of [16] implies that d˜ is
degenerate. Thus, (Y + g∗x,(−s)+ ) ∩ N ∗ 6= ∅. Use Proposition 10.3 to conclude that

   From Hypothesis 8.6 and work of Huntsinger (see Theorem A.1.2 of [4]), it is
known that µ bO is represented by a locally constant function (which we will also
denote µbO ) on mreg . (When k has characteristic zero, this is a result of Harish-
Chandra [10, Theorem 4.4].) From §13, Θπ is also represented by a locally constant
function.

Proof. For m ∈ Mr′′ , we have γm ∈ Greg . Let T = CG (γm)◦ . From Lemmata 1
and 2 of [5], 0 6= det((Ad(γm) − 1)g/t ). Since Ad(γm) = Ad(γ) Ad(m) = Ad(m)
on m/t, 0 6= det((Ad(m) − 1)|m/t ), and so m ∈ M reg . Thus, Mr′′ ⊂ M reg , and
thus m′′r ⊂ mreg , and so the right-hand side of the equation makes sense. Since
γMr′′ ⊂ Greg , the left-hand side makes sense from Proposition 13.1. The result now
follows from Corollary 12.9 and Lemma 7.5.                                        
Corollary 12.11. Let r > max{ρ(π), 2s(γ)}. Then

        Θπ (gγ e(Y )g −1 ) =    cO µbO (Y ) for all        Y ∈ m′′r , g ∈ G.
                              O∈Om (0)

Proof. This follows from Corollary 12.10 and the G-invariance of Θπ .                
Remark 12.12. When γ is regular, we have that M◦ is a torus, and so the only
nilpotent orbit in m is the 0 orbit. Thus in this case there is only one orbital
integral in the character expansion and its Fourier transform is a constant function.
This means that the domain of validity of the local character expansion near a
regular semisimple element is a domain on which Θπ is constant. Thus we recover
a generalization of the main result of [13].
Remark 12.13. It would be desirable, for applications of motivic integration to
character theory, to have a version of Theorem 12.1 (and thus of its corollaries) that
is valid under the weaker hypothesis that r > max{ρ(π), s(γ)}. In order to obtain
such a theorem, one would have to replace the one part of the proof of Theorem 12.1
that assumes r > 2s(γ): the proof of inequality (12.8). This inequality allows us
to apply Remark 10.6, a slight strengthening of Lemma 10.5, to the character di .
However, if we had a version of Lemma 10.5 strong enough to apply directly to the
representation d (which is not necessarily one dimensional), then (12.8) would be
unnecessary. We will pursue this matter elsewhere.

             13. Appendix: Characters are locally constant
   In this section only, k denotes a nonarchimedean local field, G denotes an arbi-
trary reductive k-group, and Θπ denotes the distribution character of an admissible
irreducible representation π of G. We place no other hypotheses on k or G. In par-
ticular, we do not assume any of the hypotheses in §8.
Proposition 13.1. The character Θπ is represented by a function that is locally
constant on Greg .
    Recall that we needed this in order to prove Cor. 12.10.
    Of course, when k has characteristic zero and G is connected, the above is a result
of Howe [12] and Harish-Chandra [10]. (Moreover, Harish-Chandra [10] showed that
|DG |1/2 Θπ is locally integrable, a result that Clozel [5] extended to nonconnected
groups. But we do not need this.) When k has arbitrary characteristic and G is
connected, Harish-Chandra [9] gave an alternative proof of local constancy (which is
independent of local integrability), except that he proves Theorem 1 of loc. cit. (the
“submersion principle”) only in characteristic zero. According to Harish-Chandra,
Borel knew a characteristic-free proof of the submersion principle. However, the
first such published proof is due to Gopal Prasad, and appears as Appendix B in [4].
    Thus, the only novelty in our result above is that we simultaneously relax the
requirements that k have characteristic zero and that G be connected.
18                   JEFFREY D. ADLER AND JONATHAN KORMAN


   The proof, on the other hand, involves no novelty at all, since the characteristic-
free proofs mentioned above can be generalized without difficulty to the case of
nonconnected groups. Here we outline how to do so.
   We look first at Prasad’s proof of the submersion principle. Describing the
changes necessary to generalize the proof would take about as much space as the
proof itself. So for the reader’s convenience, we present the generalized proof, even
though it is almost a word-for-word copy of Prasad’s.
Proposition 13.2 (Harish-Chandra). Suppose k is an arbitrary field, G is a re-
ductive k-group, and P is a parabolic subgroup of G◦ . For x ∈ G, let x∗ denote the
image of x under the projection of G onto G∗ = G/P . Fix γ ∈ Greg . The mapping
                                       x → (x γ)∗
from G to G∗ is everywhere submersive.
Proof (G. Prasad). Let φγ : G → G∗ denote the map x → (x γ)∗ . Since φγ (xy) =
φy γ (x), it is enough to show that φγ is submersive at the identity.
   Define
                                        −1
                               V := {γ X − X | X ∈ g}.
We must show that g = V + p where p is the Lie algebra of P .
   Without loss of generality, we assume that k is algebraically closed.
   The identity component of CG (γ) is a torus T of G. Let B be a Borel subgroup
containing T and let U denote its unipotent radical. Let T ′ be a maximal torus
lying in B∩P . Let b (resp., t, resp., t′ , resp. u) denote the Lie algebra of B (resp. T ,
resp., T ′ , resp. U ). Note that g decomposes as a direct sum of Ad(γ)-eigenspaces,
and V contains all of the non-trivial eigenspaces, so t + V = g. Thus, it is enough
to show that t ⊂ V + p. Since t′ is contained in p and u ⊂ V , we conclude that
u + t′ ⊂ V + p. However, b = u + t′ , so t ⊂ b ⊂ V + p, and so we are finished. 
   We now turn to the rest of Harish-Chandra’s proof of local constancy. Now that
the submersion principle has been established in the generality we require, the rest
of the proof works without change, except for the places where Harish-Chandra
uses the Cartan decomposition in the proof of his Theorem 2 (§4 of [9]). We now
describe how to generalize this decomposition in a way that meets the requirements
of Harish-Chandra’s proof.
   Let K denote a special maximal compact subgroup of G◦ , i.e., the stabilizer of a
special vertex x ∈ B(G◦ , k). Pick a maximal k-split torus A such that x lies in the
apartment of A = A(k). Let M = CG (A). Then M is a minimal Levi k-subgroup
of G◦ , and there is some minimal parabolic k-subgroup P with Levi decomposition
P = MN.
   Recall that G◦ has the Cartan decomposition for G◦ = KM + K, where we can
define M + to be the set of all m ∈ M such that m−1 (P ∩ Gx,r )m ⊆ P ∩ Gx,r for all
r > 0. Harish-Chandra uses the Cartan decomposition, together with the following
fact: there is a base {Kr }r∈N of compact, open, normal subgroups of K such that
for each r, there is a compact open subgroup Pr ⊂ P such that m−1 Pr m ⊂ Kr for
all m ∈ M + . So we only need to prove the following:
                              f+ ⊂ G such that G = K M
Lemma 13.3. There is a subset M                      f+ K, and such that
            f , we have that
for all m ∈ M +

(∗)                    m−1 (P ∩ Gx,r )m ⊆ Gx,r       for all r > 0.

Proof. Let Mf denote the set of elements of G that normalize the pair (P, A). Then
f ∩ G = M . Since G◦ acts transitively on the set of all pairs consisting of a
M      ◦

maximal k-split torus and a minimal parabolic subgroup containing it, we have
that every coset in G/G◦ contains an element of M  f. That is, M f/M is naturally
                   ◦
isomorphic to G/G . Thus, G = K M K.f
   Define Mf+ to be the set of all elements of Mf that satisfy condition (∗) of the
lemma.
   Since M/A is compact, M has a unique Moy-Prasad filtration: for r > 0, Mr =
                        f normalizes M , it also normalizes each Mr . Each group
Mx,r = M ∩ Gx,r . Since M
Gx,r has an Iwahori factorization with respect to P = M N . Thus, an element m
   f lies in M
of M         f+ if and only if m−1 (N ∩ Gx,r )m ⊆ N ∩ Gx,r for all r > 0.
   Recall that A ∩ M + contains an element m0 with the property that m−1   0 (N ∩
                                                        f
Gx,r )m0 ⊂ N ∩ Gx,r+1 for all r > 0. Thus, for any m ∈ M , there is some positive i
such that mmi0 ∈ Mf+ . This implies that Mf+ meets every coset of Mf/M , and thus
             f
that G = K M K.+
