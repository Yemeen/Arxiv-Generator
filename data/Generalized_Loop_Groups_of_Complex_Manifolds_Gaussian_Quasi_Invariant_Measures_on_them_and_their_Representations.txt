                                                       Loop groups G as families of mappings of the complex manifold M

                                                   and y0 ∈ N are investigated. Quasi-invariant measures µ on G relative
                                                   to dense subgroups G′ are constructed. These measures are used for
                                                   the studying of irreducible representations of such groups.


                                             1     Introduction.
                                             Loop groups are very important in differential geometry, algebraic topol-
                                             ogy and theoretical physics [7, 9, 36, 46], but about Gaussian quasi-invariant
                                             differentiable measures on them nothing was known. Only the simplest possi-
                                             ble representations associated with path’s integrals were constructed for loop

                                                                                    1
groups of the circle, that is, for the manifold M = S 1 and (real) Riemann
manifolds N [36]. On the other hand, the quasi-invariant measures may be
used for a construction of regular unitary representations [29, 30, 31, 34].
Moreover, the quasi-invariant measures are helpful for an investigation of
the group itself. In the previous papers of the author [32, 33] loop groups of
Riemann manifolds M and N were investigated, where either M = S n were
n-dimensional real spheres, n = 1, 2, ..., or M = S ∞ was a unit sphere in
a real separable Hilbert space l2 (R). It was a progress in comparison with
previous works of others authors, which considered only loop groups for the
simplest case M = S 1 .
      This article treats arbitrary complex separable connected metrizable man-
ifolds M and N. For example, products of odd-dimensional real spheres
S 2n−1 × S 2m−1 may be supplied in different ways by structures of complex
manifolds [28]. Another numerous examples of complex manifolds may be
found in [24] and references therein such as domains in Cn , a complex torus
Cn /D, where D is a discrete additive subgroup of Cn generated by a basis
τ1 , ..., τ2n of Cn over R; a quotient space G/D of a complex Lie group G
by a discrete subgroup D, submanifolds of the complex Grassman manifold
Gp,q (C), also their different products and their submanifolds. In general there
are complex compact manifolds, which are not Kähler manifolds [27, 35]. For
the construction of loop groups here are used manifolds M with some mild
additional conditions. When M is finite-dimensional over C we suppose that
it is compact. This condition is not very restrictive, since each locally com-
pact space has Alexandroff (one-point) compactification (see Theorem 3.5.11
in [13]). When M is infinite-dimensional over C it is assumed, that M is
embedded as a closed bounded subset into the corresponding Banach space
XM over C. This is necessary that to define a group structure on a quotient
space of a free loop space.
      The free loop space is considered as consisting of continuous functions
f : M → N which are holomorphic on M \ M ′ and preserving marked
points f (s0 ) = y0 , where M ′ is a closed real submanifold depending on f
with a codimension codimR M ′ = 1, s0 ∈ M and y0 ∈ N are marked points.
There are two reasons to consider such class of mappings. The first is the
need to define correctly compositions of elements in the loop group (see
beneath). The second is the isoperimetric inequality for holomorphic loops,
which can cause the condition of a loop to be constant on a sufficiently small
neighbourhood of s0 in M, if this loop is in some small neighbourhood of w0 ,

                                       2
where w0 (M) := {y0 } is a constant loop (see Remark 3.2 in [22]).
    In this article loop groups of different classes are considered. Classes
analogous to Gevrey classes of f : M \ M ′ → N are considered for the con-
struction of dense loop subgroups and quasi-invariant measures. Henceforth,
we consider only orientable manifolds M and N, since for a non-orientable
manifold there always exists its orientable double covering manifold (see §6.5
in [1]). Loop commutative monoids with the cancellation property are quo-
tients of families of mappings f from M into a manifold N with f (s0 ) = y0 by
the corresponding equivalence relation. For the definition of the equivalence
relation here are not used groups of holomorphic diffeomorphisms because
of strong restrictions on their structure caused by holomorphicity (see Theo-
rems 1 and 2 in [5]). Groups are constructed from monoids with the help of
A. Grothendieck procedure. These groups are commutative and non-locally
compact. They does not have non-trivial local one-parameter subgroups {g b :
b ∈ (−a, a)} with a > 0 for an element g corresponding to a class of a mapping
f : M → N, f (s0 ) = y0 , when f is such that supy∈N [card(f −1 (y))] = k < ℵ0 ,
since g 1/p does not exist in the loop group for each prime integer p such that
p > k (see §2). Therefore, they are not Banach-Lie groups, since in each
neighbourhood W of the unit element e there are elements which does not
belong to any local one-parameter subgroup.
    Irreducible components of strongly continuous unitary representations
of Abelian locally compact groups are one-dimensional by Theorem 22.17
[20]. In general commutative non-locally compact groups may have infinite-
dimensional irreducible strongly continuous unitary representations, for ex-
ample, infinite-dimensional Banach spaces over R considered as additive
groups (see §2.4 in [4] and §4.5 [17] ).
    Quasi-invariant measures are constructed on these loop groups. Then
such measures are used for the investigation of irreducible unitary represen-
tations. Loop groups, their structure and quasi-invariant measures on them
are investigated in §2. Unitary representations of loop groups are given in
§3. Irreducibility of unitary representations of a dense subgroup G′ associ-
ated with purely Gaussian quasi-invariant infinitely differentiable measures
on the entire group G is investigated using specific properties of a quasi-
invariance factor relative to shifts from the dense subgroup G′ . Characters
and also infinite-dimensional irreducible unitary representations are investi-
gated below. The relation between an equivalence of regular representations


                                       3
and equivalence of the corresponding measures is studied.


2     Loop groups.
To avoid misunderstanding we first give our Definitions and notations.
    2.1. Definitions and Notes.1. Let G be a Hausdorff topological group,
we denote by µ : Af (G, µ) → [0, ∞) ⊂ R a σ-additive measure. Its left shifts
µφ (E) := µ(φ−1 ◦ E) are considered for each E ∈ Af (G, µ), where Af (G, µ)
is the completion of Bf (G) by µ-null sets, Bf (G) is the Borel σ-field on G,
φ◦E := {φ◦h : h ∈ E}. Then µ is called quasi-invariant if there exists a dense
subgroup G′ such that µφ is equivalent to µ for each φ ∈ G′ . Henceforth, we
assume that a quasi-invariance factor ρµ (φ, g) = µφ (dg)/µ(dg) is continuous
by (φ, g) ∈ G′ × G, µ(V ) > 0 for some (open) neighbourhood V ⊂ G of the
unit element e ∈ G and µ(G) < ∞.
    Let (M, F) be a space M of measures on (G, Bf (G)) with values in R and
G” be a dense subgroup in G such that a topology F on M is compatible
with G”, that is, µ 7→ µh is the homomorphism of (M, F) into itself for each
h ∈ G”. Let F be the topology of convergence for each E ∈ Bf (G). Suppose
also that G and G” are real Banach manifolds such that the tangent space
Te G” is dense in Te G, then T G and T G” are also Banach manifolds. Let
Ξ(G”) denotes the set of all differentiable vector fields X on G”, that is,
X are sections of the tangent bundle T G”. We say that the measure µ is
continuously differentiable if there exists its tangent mapping Tφ µφ (E)(Xφ )
corresponding to the strong differentiability relative to the Banach struc-
tures of the manifolds G” and T G”. Its differential we denote Dφ µφ (E), so
Dφ µφ (E)(Xφ ) is the σ-additive real measure by subsets E ∈ Af (G, µ) for
each φ ∈ G” and X ∈ Ξ(G”) such that Dµ(E) : T G” → R is continuous for
each E ∈ Af (G, µ), where Dφ µφ (E) = pr2 ◦ (T µ)φ (E), pr2 : p × F → F is
the projection in T N, p ∈ N, Tp N = F, N is another real Banach differen-
tiable manifold modelled on a Banach space F, for a differentiable mapping
V : G” → N by T V : T G” → T N is denoted the corresponding tangent
mapping, (T µ)φ (E) := Tφ µφ (E). Then by induction µ is called n times
continuously differentiable if T n−1µ is continuously differentiable such that
T n µ := T (T n−1µ), (D n µ)φ (E)(X1,φ , ..., Xn,φ ) are the σ-additive real measures
by E ∈ Af (G, µ) for each X1 ,...,Xn ∈ Ξ(G”), where (Xj )φ =: Xj,φ for each
j = 1, ..., n and φ ∈ G”, D n µ : Af (G, µ) ⊗ Ξ(G”)n → R.


                                         4
     2.1.2.1.         A canonical closed subset Q of X = Rn or of the standard
separable Hilbert space X = l2 (R) over R is called a quadrant if it can
be given by Q := {x ∈ X : qj (x) ≥ 0}, where (qj : j ∈ ΛQ ) are linearly
independent elements of the topologically adjoint space X ∗ . Here ΛQ ⊂
N (with card(ΛQ) = k ≤ n when X = Rn ) and k is called the index of
Q. If x ∈ Q and exactly j of the qi ’s satisfy qi (x) = 0 then x is called
a corner of index j. Since the unitary space X = Cn or the separable
Hilbert space l2 (C) over C as considered over the field R is isomorphic with
XR := R2n or l2 (R) respectively, then the above definition also describes
quadrants in Cn and l2 (C) in such sense (see also [37]). In the latter case we
also consider generalized quadrants as canonical closed subsets which can be
given by Q := {x ∈ XR : qj (x + aj ) ≥ 0, aj ∈ XR , j ∈ ΛQ }, where ΛQ ⊂ N
(card(ΛQ ) = k ∈ N when dimR XR < ∞).
     2.1.2.2. If for each open subset U ⊂ Q ⊂ X a function f : Q → Y for
Banach spaces X and Y over R has continuous Frechét differentials D α f |U
on U with supx∈U kD α f (x)kL(X α ,Y ) < ∞ for each 0 ≤ α ≤ r for an integer
0 ≤ r or r = ∞, then f belongs to the class of smoothness C r (Q, Y ),
where 0 ≤ r ≤ ∞, L(X k , Y ) denotes the Banach space of bounded k-linear
operators from X into Y .
     2.1.2.3. A differentiable mapping f : U → U ′ is called a diffeomorphism
if
     (i) f is bijective and there exist continuous f ′ and (f −1 )′ , where U and
U ′ are interiors of quadrants Q and Q′ in X.
     In the complex case we consider bounded generalized quadrants Q and
Q in Cn or l2 (C) such that they are domains with piecewise C ∞ -boundaries
   ′

and we impose additional conditions on the diffeomorphism f :
           ¯ = 0 on U,
     (ii) ∂f
     (iii) f and all its strong (Frechét) differentials (as multilinear opera-
tors) are bounded on U, where ∂f and ∂f          ¯ are differential (1, 0) and (0, 1)
                                     ¯
forms respectively, d = ∂ + ∂ is an exterior derivative. In particular for
z = (z 1 , ..., z n ) ∈ Cn , z j ∈ C, z j = x2j−1 + ix2j and x2j−1 , x2j ∈ R for each
j = 1, ..., n, i = (−1)1/2 , there are expressions: ∂f := nj=1(∂f /∂z j )dz j ,
                                                                      P
¯ := Pn (∂f /∂ z̄ j )dz̄ j . In the infinite-dimensional case there are equa-
∂f           j=1
tions: (∂f )(ej ) = ∂f /∂z j and (∂f   ¯ )(ej ) = ∂f /∂ z̄ j , where {ej : j ∈ N} is the
standard orthonormal base in l2 (C), ∂f /∂z j = (∂f /∂x2j−1 − i∂f /∂x2j )/2,
∂f /∂ z̄ j = (∂f /∂x2j−1 + i∂f /∂x2j )/2.
     Cauchy-Riemann Condition (ii) means that f on U is the holomorphic

                                           5
mapping.
    2.1.2.4. A complex manifold M with corners is defined in the usual way:
it is a metric separable space modelled on X = Cn or X = l2 (C) and is
supposed to be of class C ∞ . Charts on M are denoted (Ul , ul , Ql ), that is
ul : Ul → ul (Ul ) ⊂ Ql are C ∞ -diffeomorphisms, Ul are open in M, ul ◦ uj −1
are biholomorphic from domains uj (Ul ∩ Uj ) 6= ∅ onto ul (Ul ∩ Uj ) (that is
uj ◦ u−1
       l     and ul ◦ u−1
                       j   are holomorphic and bijective) and ul ◦ u−1j   satisfy
conditions (i − iii) from §2.1.2.3, j Uj = M (see also Note 2.2.3).
                                     S

    A point x ∈ M is called a corner of index j if there exists a chart (U, u, Q)
of M with x ∈ U and u(x) is of index indM (x) = j in u(U) ⊂ Q. The set of
all corners of index j ≥ 1 is called the border ∂M of M, x is called an inner
point of M if indM (x) = 0, so ∂M = j≥1 ∂ j M, where ∂ j M := {x ∈ M :
                                          S

indM (x) = j}.
    For the real manifold with corners on the connecting mappings ul ◦ u−1  j ∈
  ∞
C of real charts is imposed only Condition 2.1.2.3(i).
    2.1.2.5. A subset Y ⊂ M is called a submanifold with corners of M if for
each y ∈ Y there exists a chart (U, u, Q) of M centered at y (that is u(y) = 0
) and there exists a quadrant Q′ ⊂ Ck or in l2 (C) such that Q′ ⊂ Q and
u(Y ∩ U) = u(U) ∩ Q′ . A submanifold with corners Y of M is called neat, if
the index in Y of each y ∈ Y coincides with its index in M.
    Analogously for real manifolds with corners for Rk and Rn or l2 (R) in-
stead of Ck and Cn or l2 (C).
    2.1.2.6. Henceforth, the term a complex manifold N modelled on X =
Cn or X = l2 (C) means a metric separable space supplied with an atlas
{(Uj , φj ) : j ∈ ΛN } such that:
    (i) Uj is an open subset of N for each j ∈ ΛN and j∈ΛN Uj = N, where
                                                          S

ΛN ⊂ N;
    (ii) φj : Uj → φj (Uj ) ⊂ X are C ∞ -diffeomorphisms, where φj (Uj ) are
  ∞
C -domains in X;
    (iii) φj ◦ φ−1
                 m is a biholomorphic mapping from φm (Um ∩ Uj ) onto φj (Um ∩
Uj ) while Um ∩ Uj 6= ∅. When X = l2 (C) it is supposed, that φj ◦ φ−1    m are
Frechét (strongly) C ∞ -differentiable.
    2.1.3.1. Let X be either the standard separable Hilbert space l2 = l2 (C)
over the field C of complex numbers or X = Cn . Let t ∈ No := N∪{0}, N :=
{1, 2, 3, ...} and W be a domain with a continuous piecewise C ∞ -boundary
∂W in R2m , m ∈ N, that is W is a C ∞ -manifold with corners and it is a
canonical closed subset of Cm , cl(Int(W )) = W , where cl(V ) denotes the

                                       6
closure of V , Int(V ) denotes the interior of V in the corresponding topological
space. As usually H t (W, X) denotes the Sobolev space of functions f : W →
X for which there exists a finite norm
     kf kH t (W,X) := ( |α|≤t kD α f k2 L2 (W,X) )1/2 < ∞,
                        P

where f (x) = (f j (x)R : j ∈ N), f (x) ∈ l2 , f j (x) ∈ C, x ∈ W ,
     kf k2 L2 (W,X) := W kf (x)k2 X λ(dx), λ is the Lebesgue measure on R2m ,
kzkl2 := ( ∞          j 2 1/2
                j=1 |z | )    , z = (z j : j ∈ N) ∈ l2 , z j ∈ C. Then H ∞ (W, X) :=
              P
         t
  t∈N H (W, X) is the uniform space with the uniformity given by the family
T

of norms {kf kH t (W,X) : t ∈ N}.
     2.1.3.2. Let now M be a compact Riemann or complex C ∞ -manifold
with corners with a finite atlas At(M) := {(Ui , φi , Qi ); i ∈ ΛM }, where Ui
are open in M, φi : Ui → φi (Ui ) ⊂ Qi ⊂ Rm (or it is a subset in Cm ) are
diffeomorphisms (in addition holomorphic respectively as in §2.1.2.3), (Ui , φi )
are charts, i ∈ ΛM ⊂ N.
     Let also N be a separable complex metrizable manifold with corners mod-
elled either on X = Cn or on X = l2 (C) respectively. Let (Vi , ψi , Si ) be
charts of an atlas At(N) := {(Vi , ψi , Si ) : i ∈ ΛN } such that ΛN ⊂ N
and ψi : Vi → ψi (Vi ) ⊂ Si ⊂ X are diffeomorphisms, Vi are open in
N, i∈ΛN Vi = N. We denote by H t (M, N) the Sobolev space of func-
      S

tions f : M → N for which fi,j ∈ H t (Wi,j , X) for each j ∈ ΛM and
i ∈ ΛN for a domain Wi,j 6= ∅ of fi,j , where fi,j := ψi ◦ f ◦ φj −1 , and
Wi,j = φj (Uj ∩ f −1 (Vi )) are canonical closed subsets of Rm (or Cm respec-
tively). The uniformity in H t (M, N) is given by the following base {(f, g) ∈
(H t (M, N))2 : i∈ΛN ,j∈ΛM kfi,j − gi,j k2 H t (Wi,j ,X) < ǫ}, where ǫ > 0, Wi,j are
                   P

domains of (fi,j − gi,j ). For t = ∞ as usually H ∞ (M, N) := t∈N H t (M, N).
                                                                     T

     2.1.3.3. For two complex manifolds M and N with corners let OΥ (M, N)
denotes a space of continuous mappings f : M → N such that for each f
there exists a partition Zf of M with the help of a real C ∞ -submanifold
M ′ f , which may be with corners, such that its codimension over R in M is
codimR M ′ f = 1 and M \M ′ f is a disjoint union of open complex submanifolds
Mj,f possibly with corners with j = 1, 2, ... such that each restriction f |Mj,f is
holomorphic with all its derivatives bounded on Mj,f . For a given partition Z
(instead of Zf ) and the corresponding M ′ the latter subspace of continuous
piecewise holomorphic mappings f : M → N is denoted by O(M, N; Z).
The family {Z} of all such partitions is denoted Υ. That is OΥ (M, N) =
str − indΥ (M, N; Z). Let also O(M, N) denotes the space of holomorphic


                                         7
mappings f : M → N, Dif f ∞ (M) denotes a group of C ∞ -diffeomorphisms
of M and Dif fΥO (M) := Hom(M) ∩ OΥ (M, M), where Hom(M) is a group
of homeomorphisms.
     Let A and B be two complex manifolds with corners such that B is a
submanifold of A. Then B is called a strong C r ([0, 1] × A, A)-retract (or
C r ([0, 1], OΥ (A, A))-retract) of A if there exists a mapping F : [0, 1] × A → A
such that F (0, z) = z for each z ∈ A and F (1, A) = B and F (x, A) ⊃ B for
each x ∈ [0, 1] := {y : 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, y ∈ R}, F (x, z) = z for each z ∈ B and x ∈
[0, 1], where F ∈ C r ([0, 1] × A, A) or F ∈ C r ([0, 1], OΥ (A, A)) respectively,
r ∈ [0, ∞), F = F (x, z), x ∈ [0, 1], z ∈ A. Such F is called the retraction. In
the case of B = {a0 }, a0 ∈ A we say that A is C r ([0, 1] × A, A)-contractible
(or C r ([0, 1], OΥ (A, A))-contractible correspondingly). Two maps f : A → E
and h : A → E are called C r ([0, 1]×A, E)-homotopic (or C r ([0, 1], OΥ (A, E))-
homotopic ) if there exists F ∈ C r ([0, 1] × A, E) (or F ∈ C r ([0, 1], OΥ (A, E))
respectively) such that F (0, z) = f (z) and F (1, z) = h(z) for each z ∈ A,
where E is also a complex manifold. Such F is called the homotopy.
     Let M be a complex manifold with corners satisfying the following con-
ditions:
     (i) it is compact;
     (ii) M is a union of two closed complex submanifolds A1 and A2 with
corners, which are canonical closed subsets in M with A1 ∩A2 = ∂A1 ∩∂A2 =:
A3 and a codimension over R of A3 in M is codimR A3 = 1;
     (iii) a marked point s0 is in A3 ;
     (iv) A1 and A2 are C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (Aj , Aj ))-contractible into a marked point
s0 ∈ A3 by mappings Fj (x, z), where either j = 1 or j = 2.
     We consider all finite partitions Z := {Mk : k ∈ ΞZ } of M such that Mk
are complex submanifolds (of M), which may be with corners and sk=1 Mk =
                                                                         S

M, ΞZ = {1, 2, ..., s}, s ∈ N depends on Z, Mk are canonical closed subsets of
                      ˜
M. We denote by diam(Z)         := supk (diam(Mk )) the diameter of the partition
Z, where diam(A) = supx,y∈A |x − y|Cn is a diameter of a subset A in Cn ,
since each finite-dimensional manifold M can be embedded into Cn with the
corresponding n ∈ N. We suppose also that Mi ∩Mj ⊂ M ′ and ∂Mj ⊂ M ′ for
each i 6= j, where M ′ is a closed C ∞ -submanifold (which may be with corners)
in M with the codimension codimR (M ′ ) = 1 of M ′ in M, M ′ = j∈ΓZ M ′ j ,
                                                                          S

M ′ j are C ∞ -submanifolds of M, ΓZ is a finite subset of N.
     We denote by H t (M, N; Z) a space of continuous functions f : M → N


                                         8
such that f |(M \M ′ ) ∈ H t (M \ M ′ , N) and f |[Int(Mi)∪(Mi ∩M ′ j )] ∈ H t (Int(Mi ) ∪
(Mi ∩ M ′ j ), N), when ∂Mi ∩ M ′ j 6= ∅, hZZ ′ : H t (M, N; Z) → H t (M, N; Z ′ )
are embeddings for each Z ≤ Z ′ in Υ.
                                                                       ′
    The ordering Z ≤ Z ′ means that each submanifold MiZ from a partition
Z ′ either belongs to the family (Mj : j = 1, ..., k) = (MjZ : j = 1, ..., k) for
                                        ′                                                 ′
Z or there exists j such that MiZ ⊂ MjZ and MjZ is a finite union of MlZ
                ′                                 ′
for which MlZ ⊂ MjZ . Moreover, these MlZ are submanifolds (may be with
corners) in MjZ .
    Then we consider the following uniform space Hpt (M, N) that is the strict
                                                ′
inductive limit str − ind{H t (M, N; Z); hZZ ; Υ} (the index p reminds about
the procedure of partitions), where Υ is the directed family of all such Z, for
              ˜
which limΥ diam(Z)      = 0.
    2.1.4. Let now s0 be the marked point in M such that s0 ∈ A3 (see
§2.1.3.3) and y0 be a marked point in the manifold N.
    (i). Suppose that M and N are connected.
    Let Hpt (M, s0 ; N, y0) := {f ∈ H t (M, N)|f (s0 ) = y0 } denotes the closed
subspace of H t (M, N) and ω0 be its element such that ω0 (M) = {y0 }, where
∞ ≥ t ≥ m+1, 2m = dimR M such that H t ⊂ C 0 due to the Sobolev embed-
ding theorem. The following subspace {f : f ∈ Hp∞ (M, s0 ; N, y0), ∂f             ¯ = 0}
is isomorphic with OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ), since f |(M \M ′ ) ∈ H (M \ M ′ , N) =
                                                                      ∞

C ∞ (M \ M ′ , N) and ∂f ¯ = 0.
    Let as usually A ∨ B := A × {b0 } ∪ {a0 } × B ⊂ A × B be the wedge sum
of pointed spaces (A, a0 ) and (B, b0 ), where A and B are topological spaces
with marked points a0 ∈ A and b0 ∈ B. Then the wedge combination g ∨ f
of two elements f, g ∈ Hpt (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) is defined on the domain M ∨ M (see
also Chapters 0-2 [46] and Example 2.4.12 [13]).
    The spaces OΥ (J, A3 ; N, y0) := {f ∈ OΥ (J, N) : f (A3 ) = {y0 }} have
the manifold structure and have embeddings into OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0) due to
Condition 2.1.3.3(ii), where either J = A1 or J = A2 . This induces the
following embedding χ∗ : OΥ (M ∨ M, s0 × s0 ; N, y0) ֒→ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ).
Therefore g ◦ f := χ∗ (f ∨ g) is the composition in OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ).
    The space C ∞ (M, N) is dense in C 0 (M, N) and there is the inclusion
OΥ (M, N) ⊂ Hp∞ (M, N). Let MR be the Riemann manifold generated by
M considered over R. Then Dif fs∞0 (MR ) is a group of C ∞ -diffeomorphisms
η of MR preserving the marked point s0 , that is η(s0 ) = s0 . There exists the
following equivalence relation RO in OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ): f RO h if and only if


                                            9
there exist nets ηn ∈ Dif fs∞0 (MR ), also fn and hn ∈ Hp∞ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) with
limn fn = f and limn hn = h such that fn (x) = hn (ηn (x)) for each x ∈ M
and n ∈ ω, where ω is an ordinal, f, h ∈ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0) and converegence
is considered in Hp∞ (M, s0 ; N, y0).
    The quotient space OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 )/RO =: (S M N)O is called the loop
semigroup. It will be shown later, that (S M N)O has a structure of topo-
logical Abelian monoid with the cancellation property. Applying the A.
Grothendieck procedure [26, 45] to (S M N)O we get a loop group (LM N)O .
For the spaces Hpt (M, s0 ; N, y0) the corresponding equivalence relations are
                                                                            M
denoted Rt,H , the group semigroups are denoted by (SR                        N)t,H , the loop
                                 M
groups are denoted by (LR N)t,H .
    2.2. Propositions. (1). Let f be a diffeomorphism satisfying Con-
ditions 2.1.2.3(i − iii), then there are neighbourhoods V and V ′ of bounded
generalized quadrants Q and Q′ such that f has an extension f to the holo-
morphic diffeomorphism of V with V ′ .
    (2). If f : U → C is a mapping satisfying Conditions 2.1.2.3(ii, iii), then
there exists a neighbourhood V of Q such that f has a holomorphic extension
onto V .
    Proof. (1). From [43, 47] it follows, that f has a C ∞ -extension h onto
an open domain W with a C ∞ -boundary such that W ⊃ Q, since due to
Condition 2.1.2.3(iii) each partial derivative
D α f := ∂ |α| f /∂(z 1 )α1 ...∂(z n )αn ∂(z̄ 1 )αn+1 ...∂(z̄ n )α2n has a bounded continuous
extension onto Q due to the line integration of D β f along C ∞ -curves, where
β = α + ej , α = (α1 , ..., α2n ), 0 ≤ αj ∈ Z, j = 1, ..., 2n, since Q is simply
connected. Therefore, ∂f      ¯ = 0 on Q.
    If F ′ (z) = f (z) and f (z) does not satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions
for z ∈ ∂Q, then F (z) also does not satisfy them. In view of Corollary 3.2.3,
Conjecture in Exer. 3.2 and Exer. 1.28 [19] (see also references therein)
there exists a piecewise holomorphic function Φ on a bounded neighbourhood
V of Q in Cn such that on ∂Q it satisfies the jump condition Φ− (z) =
Φ+ (z) + g(z) for each z ∈ ∂Q, Φ|V \Q and Φ|Int(Q) are holomorphic and
bounded together with each partial derivative, where (α) g ∈ Hp∞ (∂Q),                     (β)

V ⊂ W . If g satisfies Conditions (α, β) only, then Φ|V \Q and Φ|Int(Q) are
of class C ∞ and bounded together with each partial derivative. Indeed,
there exists an increasing sequence Wj of C ∞ -subregions in Q such that (i)
supk diam(Ek,j ) < j −2 ; (ii) ηj : ∂Qj → ∂Wj are OΥ -diffeomorphisms (that is
homeomorphisms of class OΥ ) with ηj |∂Qj ∩∂Wj = id; (iii) gj are C ∞ -functions
satisfying Condition (γ) on ∂Wj (as g on ∂Q) and limj→∞ gj ◦ηj = g; (iv) Ek,j
are connected components of ∂Wj \ ∂Qj such that Ek,j ⊂ (∂ 2 Q)1/j , where
Aǫ := {y ∈ Cn : infz∈A |y − z| < ǫ} is an ǫ-enlargement of a subset A in
Cn , Wj ⊂ Wj+1 for each j. In view of Monthel Theorem 2.14.1 [18] there
exists a sequence of functions {Φj : j = l + 1, l + 2, ...} satisfying the same
conditions for (Wj , gj ) as Φ for (Q, g) such that Φj converges uniformly on
S∞                                                                              n

          j=l+1 Wj ⊃ (Q \ ∂ Q), Q ∩ ( j=l+1 (V \ Int(Wj )) = ∂Q and due to the
       S
                   ¯
solution of the ∂-equation        on Q and on V \ Int(Q) there exists the sequence
{Φj : j > l} which converges to the desired Φ on V , where ∂˜p Q := j,j≥p ∂ j Q,
                                                                        S

p ∈ N (see §2.1.2.4). In the particular case of a C 1 -domain Q in C see also
[39, 40]. The line integration of Φ along C ∞ -curves produces a continuous Φ
with the jump condition for ∂Φ instead of Φ due to Cauchy Integral Theorem
in the Stronger Form 6.4.1 [18] and [19], since Q is simply connected (see also
§3.5 [38]).
     Therefore, there exists C ∞ -function v on V such that v|Q = 0 and ∂v    ¯ =
   ¯
−∂h on V . That to construct such v let v = v1 − v2 − v3 , where v1 |Q =
(v2 + v3 )|Q , v1 is a C ∞ -function on U = Q \ ∂Q and on V \ Q, v2 and v3
are holomorphic on U and V \ Q, v1+ |∂Q = f + |∂Q , v2+ |∂Q = 0, ∂v2− |∂Q =
∂f + |∂Q , v3+ |∂Q = f + |∂Q , v3− |∂Q = 0. In view of the theorem about maximum
principle of the modulus of a holomorphic function on a simply connected
domain the condition v2+ |∂Q = 0 implies v2 |Q = 0 (see §3.6 [38]). Therefore,
¯ Q = ∂v
∂v|        ¯ 1 |Q and ∂(h
                       ¯ + v)|V = 0 and (h + v)|Q = f . Then u := h + v is a
holomorphic extension of f on V . When n ≥ 2 Hartogs Theorem 1.2.2 [19]
can be used instead of Conjecture in Exer. 3.2, that is for the constructed
above u holomorphic on V \ ∂˜2 Q there exists a function v holomorphic on V
such that v|V \∂˜2 Q = u|V \∂˜2 Q , since V \ ∂˜2 Q is connected. For Q ⊂ C1 = X
there exists a strictly pseudoconvex open set D ⊂ C2 such that X ∩ D̄ = Q,
hence by Theorem 3.6.8 [19] there exists F ∈ O(D) ∩ C 0(D̄) such that F |Q =


                                       11
f , consequently, the case of n = 1 can be reduced to the case n = 2 with a
subsequent restriction of a resulting function on X ∩ V .
     Piecewise ∂Q can be written in local coordinates in a neighbourhood Wz
of z ∈ ∂Q as x1 = 0, where z = (z 1 , z 2 , ...), z j = x2j−1 + ix2j . Therefore, f
has also such extension for Q ⊂ l2 (C).
     On the other hand, the Jacobian Jf is not equal to zero everywhere on
the closed set Q in X = Cn or X = l2 (C). In view of the strong C ∞ -
differentiability of f there exists an open set U in X such that Q ⊂ U ⊂ V
and Jf 6= 0 everywhere on U. Then we take U ′ = f (U), hence Q′ ⊂ U ′ and
U ′ is open in X.
     (2). The proof of this case is analogous to that of Section (1) omitting
the last paragraph from it.
     2.2.3. Note. From the proof it follows that these propsitions are true,
when Condition 2.1.2.3(iii) is fulfilled up to the second differentials on U,
since if f ∈ C 1 (V, C) and f satisfies Cauchy-Riemann conditions on V it
follows that f ∈ O(V, C). These propositions also justify the notion of f to
be holomorphic on Q as a restriction f |Q of f holomorphic on V .
     2.3.1. Lemma. If M is a complex manifold modelled on X = Cn or
X = l2 (C) with an atlas At(M) = {(Vj , φj ) : j}, then there exists an atlas
At′ (M) = {(Uk , uk , Qk ) : k} which refines At(M), where (Vj , φj ) are usual
charts with diffeomorphisms φj : Vj → φj (Vj ) such that φj (Vj ) are C ∞ -
domains in Cn and (Uk , uk , Qk ) are charts corresponding to quadrants Qk in
Cn or l2 (C).
     Proof. The covering {Vj : j} of M has a refinement {Wl : l} such that
for each j there exists l = l(j) with Wl ⊂ Vj so that each φj (Wl ) is a simply
connected region in Cn or l2 (C) which is not the whole space. We choose Wl
such that
     (i) either Wl ∩ ∂M = ∅ or Wl ∩ ∂M is open in ∂M;
     (ii) {πk (z) = z k : z ∈ φj (Wl )} =: El,k , z ∈ X, πk : X → C are canonical
projections associated with the standard orthonormal base {ej : j} in X,
E are C ∞ -regions in C, φj (Wl ) = nk=1 El,k for X = Cn , or πJ (φj (Wl )) =
                                          Q
Ql,k
   k∈J El,k for each finite subset J in N and the corresponding projection πJ :
X → spC {ek : k ∈ J}. In view of the Riemann Mapping Theorem for each
El,k there exists holomorphic diffeomorphism ql,k either onto Br− := {z ∈ C :
|z| < r} or Fr := {z ∈ C : |z| < r, x1 ≥ 0} (see §2.12 in [18]). The latter case
appears while treatment of πk (φj (Wl ∩ ∂M)) 6= ∅ (see §10.5.2 [42] and §12
[18]). Slightly shrinking covering if necessary we can choose {Wl : l} such that

                                        12
each ql,k and its derivatives are bounded on El,k . In view of Central Theorem
from §6.3 [18] ql,k are boundary preserving maps. In view of Chapter 13 [38]
Br− and Fr have finite atlases with charts corresponding to quadrants (see
§2.1.2 and §2.2).
    2.3.2 Note. Vice versa there are complex manifolds with corners, which
are not usual complex manifolds, for example, canonical closed domains F
in Cn with piecewise C ∞ -boundary, which is not of class C 1 . Since each
complex manifold G has ∂G of class C ∞ by Definition 2.1.2.6.
    2.4. Lemma. OΥ (M, N) from §2.1.3.3 is an infinite-dimensional com-
plex manifold dense in C 0 (M, N), when M has dimC M ≥ 1. Moreover,
there exists its tangent bundle T OΥ (M, N) = OΥ (M, T N). If N = Cn or
N = l2 (C), then OΥ (M, N) is an infinite-dimensional topological vector space
over C.
    Proof. The connecting mappings φj ◦ φ−1   k of charts (Uj , φj ) and (Uk , φk )
with Uj ∩ Uk 6= ∅ are holomorphic on the corresponding domains φk (Uj ∩
Uk ). For each submanifold Mj in M we have T O(Mj , N) = O(Mj , T N)
[12]. For each f ∈ OΥ (M, N) there exists a partition Zf of M such that
f |Mj,f ∈ O(Mj,f , N) for each submanifold Mj,f with corners defined by Zf . In
accordance with §2.1.3.2 and §2.1.4 the topology of OΥ (M, N) is the compact-
open topology, hence φj ◦ φ−1                                     −1      ∗
                              k induce connecting mappings (φj ◦ φk ) of the
                                                   −1
corresponding charts in OΥ (M, N) such that (φj ◦ φk )∗ (f (z)) := f ◦ (φ−1   j ◦
φk )(z) for each z ∈ Uj ∩ Uk such that its Frechét derivatives are the following
[∂(φ−1       ∗                −1     ∗             −1     ∗       ¯
     j ◦φk ) (f )/∂f ].h = (φj ◦φk ) (h) and [∂(φj ◦φk ) (f )/∂ f ].h = 0, where
h are vectors in Tf OΥ (Uj ∩ Uk , N). Therefore, T OΥ (M, N) = OΥ (M, T N),
since OΥ (M, N) is the complex manifold (certainly of class C ∞ ).
    In particular OΥ (M, Y ) is a topological vector space over C for Y = Cn
or Y = l2 (C). It remains to prove that OΥ (M, N) is infinite-dimensional
and dense in C 0 (M, N). This follows from Corollary 3.2.3, Exer. 1.28 and
Conjecture in Exer. 3.2 [19], since for each quadrant Q and a given func-
tion s on ∂Q, which is a restriction q|∂Q of a holomorphic function q on a
neighbourhood of ∂Q in Cm , m = dimC M, there exists a space of functions
u : W → Cn such that u|Int(Q) and u|W \Q are holomorphic and bounded
together with each partial derivative, where W is an open ball in Cn con-
taining Q and such that u+ (z) − u− (z) = s(z) for each z ∈ ∂Q. Then
using Cauchy integration along C ∞ -curves we construct a space of continu-
ous functions f : W → Cn holomorphic on U and W \ Q with prescribed
(∂f )− (z) − (∂f )+ (z) for each z ∈ ∂Q and analogously for f ∈ C l with jump

                                        13
conditions for higher order derivatives. In the case of n > 1 there also can
be used holomorphic extension of holomorphic functions from proper com-
plex submanifolds K of ∂Q (see Theorems 2(b) and 3(b) in [2] and Theorem
4.1.11 [19], since a space of rational functions f : K → Ty N such that f |K are
holomorphic is infinite-dimensional, see also Corollaries 3.4 and 3.5 in [21]).
Using charts of the atlas of M we get that OΥ (M, N) is infinite-dimensional.
     In view of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem [14] and due to the theorem
about a maximum of the modulus of a holomorphic function on a simply con-
nected domain the space OΥ (M, Y ) is dense in C 0 (M, Y ), hence OΥ (M, N)
is dense in C 0 (M, N).
     2.5. Proposition. Let A and B be two compact complex manifolds with
corners.
     (i). Then B is a strong C 0 ([0, 1] × A, A)-retract of A if and only if B is
a strong C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, A))-retract of A.
     (ii). Two maps f and h ∈ OΥ (A, B) are C 0 ([0, 1] × A, B)-homotopic if
and only if they are C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, B))-homotopic.
     Proof. Since C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, B)) ⊂ C 0 ([0, 1] × A, B), then from a strong
C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, A))-retraction (or a C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, B))-homotopy) we get a
strong C 0 ([0, 1] × A, A)-retraction (or a C 0 ([0, 1] × A, B)-homotopy respec-
tively).
     It remains to verify the opposite implications.
     (ii). Let F ∈ C 0 ([0, 1] × A, B). Consider for each x ∈ [0, 1] a com-
pact complex submanifold Bδ in A such that F (x, A) ⊂ Bδ ⊂ Eδ , where
Eδ(x) = {z ∈ A : d(z, F (x, A)) ≤ δ}, d denotes a metric in A, 0 < δ(x) <
1 − x, δ(x) < δ(x′ ) for each x > x′ , d(z, Y ) := infy∈Y d(z, y) for Y ⊂ A.
In view of Lemma 2.4 C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, Cn )) is dense in C 0 ([0, 1] × A, Cn ).
Then for each 0 < δ consider a finite atlas Atδ (M) = {(Uj,δ , φj,δ ) : j}
of M such that supj diam(Uj,δ ) < δ and supj sup(y,z∈Uj,δ ;|x−x′|<δ) kF (x, z) −
F (x′ , y)kC 0(A,Cn ) < δ, where A is embedded into Cn . We consider restrictions
F (x, ∗)|Uj,δ and such Atδ (M) generated by Z ∈ Υ. Therefore, there exist Eδ(x)
and mappings H(x, ∗) such that H(x, A) ⊂ Eδ(x) and H(x, z) ∈ OΥ (A, Eδ(x) )
and kH(x, ∗) − F (x, ∗)kC 0 (A,Cn ) < ǫ(x) < ∞ for each x ∈ [0, 1], where
limx→1 ǫ(x) = 0. Since f, h ∈ OΥ (A, B) we can choose H(0, z) = f (z) and
H(1, z) = h(z), consequently, f and h are C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, B))-homotopic.
     (i). The proof of (i) is analogous to that of (ii) using the fact that
  x∈[ǫ,1] Eδ(x) = B for each 0 < ǫ < 1, since B is the complex manifold
T

with corners and C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, A)) is complete. For this let us choose a

                                        14
Cauchy sequence Hn (x, z) in C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (A, A)) instead of one H as in (ii)
such that Hn (0, z) = z for each z ∈ A and Hn (1, A) = Eδ(1),n are complex
submanifolds with corners of A with n Eδ(1),n = B and Eδ(1),n+1 ⊂ Eδ(1),n
                                          T

for each n ∈ N, limn→∞ Hn = H is the desired mapping.
     2.6. Lemma. Let M be a manifold from §2.1.3.3 then there exists a
mapping q : M → M such that
     (i) q(A2 ) = {s1 },
     (ii) q : (A1 \ A3 ) → (M \ {s1 }) is an OΥ -diffeomorphism,
     (iii) s1 ∈ A2 \ A3
     (iv) q is C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (M, M))-homotopic with the identity mapping idM
on M.
     Proof. In view of Lemma 2.5 it is sufficient to construct C 0 ([0, 1] ×
M, M)-homotopy. Let M be supplied with an atlas charts of which are dif-
feomorphic to subregions of quadrants (see Lemma 2.3.1). Then the mapping
F2 (0, z) from Condition 2.1.3.3(iv) has an extension to idM and F2 (1, z) has
an extension to mapping satisfying conditions (i, ii, iv) but for s0 instead of
s1 . Then due to the Riemann Mapping Theorem and Central Theorem [18]
and §§2.2-2.4 the mapping F2 defined on ([0, 1] × A2 ) ∪ ({0, 1} × M) has an
C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (M, M))-extension, since M is connected. Using retraction of
A2 onto {s0 }, compositions of homotopies and the fact that A1 and A2 are
simply connected we get a C 0 ([0, 1], OΥ (M, M))-homotopy of q with idM .
     2.7. Theorems. (1). The space (LM N)O from §2.1.4 is the complete
separable Abelian topological group.
     (2). It is non-trivial and non-locally compact.
     (3). Moreover, if there are two distinct points s0 and s1 in A3 , then two
groups (LM N)O defined for s0 and s1 as marked points are isomorphic.
     (4). (LM N)O is the closed proper subgroup in (LM   R N)∞,H .
                                              M
     Proof. At first it is proved that (S N)O is an Abelian topological
monoid with the cancellation property.
     For each f ∈ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) the range f (M) is compact and connected
in N, since M is compact. In view of Lemmas 6.8 and 6.9 [46], §2.1.4 and
Propositions 2.2, 2.5 and Lemma 2.4 there exists a countable subfamily {Zj :
j ∈ N} in Υ such that Zj ⊂ Zj+1 for each j and limj diamZ˜     j = 0. Therefore,
for each partition Z there exists δ > 0 such that for each partition Z” ∈ {Zj :
j ∈ N} with supi inf j dist(Mi , M”j ) < δ and for f ∈ O(M, s0 ; N, y0; Z),
there exists f1 ∈ O(M, s0 ; N, y0; Z”), such that f RO f1 , where dist(A, B) =
max(supa∈A D(a, B); supb∈B D(b, A)), D(a, B) := inf b∈B d(a, b), A and B are

                                      15
subspaces of the metric space Cn with the metric d(a, b) = |a − b|Cn .
    If h ∈ cl{v : f RO v}, then there exists a net {hβ ∈ {v : f RO v} : β ∈ α}
for an ordinal α such that limβ hβ = h. In view of the preceding paragraph
we can consider sequences instead of general nets and extract from a double
sequence hβ,n a convergent to h subsequence, where limn hβ,n = hβ for each
β with hβ,n (x) = fβ,n (ηβ,n (x)) for each x ∈ M, n and β such that ηβ,n ∈
Dif fs∞0 (M), and fβ,n ∈ {v : f RO v}. Therefore, each RO -equivalence class is
closed in OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0), since OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) and Hp∞ (M, s0 ; N, y0) are
complete, f (M) is a compact subset in N and due to the definition of this
equivalence relation. Then
    (i) str − ind{O(M, s0 ; N, y0; Zj ); hZZij ; N}/RO = (LM N)O is separable,
since each space O(M, s0 ; N, y0; Zj ) is separable where O(M, s0 ; N, y0 ; Z) :=
OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) ∩ O(M, N; Z). The continuity of the composition follows
from Notes in §2.1.4. The space str − ind{O(M, s0 ; N, y0; Zj ); hZZij ; N} is
complete due to Theorem 12.1.4 [41], each class of RO -equivalent elements is
closed in it. Then to each Cauchy sequence in (S M N)O there corresponds a
Cauchy sequence in str − ind{OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ; Zj ); hZZij ; N} due to §§2.2-2.5,
where Zj are the corresponding partitions of M. Hence (S M N)O is complete.
    In view of Lemma 2.6 mappings f and χ∗ (f ∨ w0 ) are RO -equivalent
for each f ∈ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0)), where w0 (M) = {y0 }, since there exists a
sequence ηn ∈ Dif fs∞0 (M) such that limn→∞ diam(ηn (A2 )) = 0 and wn , fn ∈
Hp∞ (M, s0 ; N, y0) with limn→∞ fn = f , limn→∞ wn = w0 and limn→∞ χ∗ (fn ∨
wn )(ηn−1 ) = f due to f (s0 ) = s0 and formulas of differentiation of composite
functions (see Theorem 2.5 in [3]). Hence < w0 >O is the identity element,
where < f >O := {h ∈ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) : hRO f } denotes the equivalence
class. There exists a OΥ -diffeomorphism ψ : (M1 ∨ M2 ) → (M2 ∨ M1 ), where
Mj = M for j = 1 and j = 2. Therefore, (h ∨ f )(ψ(z)) = (f ∨ h)(z)
for each z ∈ (M1 ∨ M2 ) and each f, h ∈ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ), consequently,
χ∗ (f ∨h)RO χ∗ (h∨f ), whence (S M N)O is commutative. Evidently χ∗ (f ∨h) =
χ∗ (f ∨ q) is equivalent to h = q, where f, h, q ∈ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0). Therefore,
< f >O ◦ < h >O =< f >O ◦ < q >O is equivalent to < h >O =< q >O ,
consequently, (S M N)O has the cancellation property.
    Let T N be the tangent bundle and π : T N → N be the natural projection
such that π(x) = z for each x ∈ Tz N with z ∈ N. The tangent bundle
T (S M N)O is evidently isomorphic with (OΥ (M, s0 ; T N, (y0 ×0))/RO )×Ty0 N,
where the equivalence relation RO is considered in OΥ (M, s0 ; T N, (y0 × 0)),


                                        16
y0 ∈ N. If f (M) 6= q(M), then f is not equivalent to q. Therefore, Te (S M N)O
is infinite-dimensional topological vector space, hence (S M N)O is not locally
compact (see Theorem (5.9.5) in [41]).
     If there are two points s0 and s1 as in Theorem 2.7.3, then the spaces
OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) and OΥ (M, s1 ; N, y0 ) are isomorphic. On the other hand,
χ∗ (f ∨ w0 ) is in the class of RO -equivalent elements < f >O and A2 is
C 0 ([0, 1]×M, M)-contractible into s0 and also into s1 . Therefore, the monoid
(S M N)O does not depent on the choice of a marked point s in A3 .
     For a commutative monoid with the cancellation property (S M N)O there
exists a commutative group (LM N)O equal to the Grothendieck group. This
group algebraically is the quotient group F/B, where F is a free Abelian
group generated by (S M N)O and B is a subgroup of F generated by ele-
ments [f + g] − [f ] − [g], f and g ∈ (S M N)O , [f ] denotes an element of
F corresponding to f . In view of §9 [26] and [45] the natural mapping
γ : (S M N)O → (LM N)O is injective. We supply F with a topology inherited
from the Tychonoff product topology of (S M N)ZO , where each element z of
F is z = f nf,z [f ], nf,z ∈ Z for each f ∈ (S M N)O , f |nf,z | < ∞. In
             P                                                  P

particular [nf ] − n[f ] ∈ B, hence (LM N)O is the complete topological group
and γ is the topological embedding such that γ(f + g) = γ(f ) + γ(g) for each
f, g ∈ (S M N)O , γ(e) = e, since (z + B) ∈ γ(S M N)O , when nf,z ≥ 0 for each
f , so in general z = z + − z − , where (z + + B) and (z − + B) ∈ γ(S M N)O .
     The manifold OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) is the closed submanifold of Hp∞ (M, s0 ; N, y0 )
and RO = R∞,H |OΥ , hence < f >O ⊂< f >∞,H for each f ∈ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ),
where < f >t,H := {v : v ∈ Hpt (M, s0 ; N, y0 ), vRt,H f }. Therefore, there ex-
ists embedding of the manifold (S M N)O into (SR       M
                                                         N)∞,H such that (S M N)O
                 M
is closed in (SR    N)∞,H , since (S M N)O is complete and the uniformity in
                      M
it inherited from (SR    N)∞,H concides with the initial one. Then < χ∗ (f ∨
h) >O =< f >O ◦ < h >O and < χ∗ (f ∨ h) >t,H =< f >t,H ◦ < h >t,H , conse-
quently, (S M N)O is the submonoid of the monoid (SR        M
                                                               N)∞,H and inevitably
(LM N)O is the closed subgroup in (LM       R N) ∞,H .   If f (M) 6= q(M), then <
                                        ∞
f >∞,H 6=< q >∞,H , where f, q ∈ Hp (M, s0 ; N, y0 ), since inf η∈Dif fs∞0 (MR ) kf ◦
η − qkC 0 > 0. If f ∈ OΥ (M, N), then f (M) is a complex submanifold with
corners in N, since f is piecewise holomorphic [38, 42]. On the other hand,
there exists a family of f ∈ Hp∞ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) such that f (M) is not a complex
manifold with corners. Therefore, (LM                     M
                                          R N)∞,H \ (L N)O has the cardinality
c := card(R), since card(Hp∞ (M, s0 ; N, y0 )) = c and card(S M N)∞,H = c.

    2.8. Notes and Definitions. 1. In view of §I.5 [24] a complex manifold
M considered over R admits a Riemann metric g. Due to Theorem IV.2.2
[24] there exists the Levi-Civita connection (with vanishing torsion) of MR .
Suppose ν is a measure on M corresponding to the Riemann volume element
w ( m-form ) ν(dx) = w(dx)/w(M). The Riemann metric g is positive
definite and w is non-degenerate and non-negative, since M is orientable.
    The Christoffel symbols Γki,j of the Levi-Civitá derivation (see §1.8.12
[23]) are of class C ∞ for M. Then the equivalent uniformity in H t (M, N)
for 0 ≤ t < ∞ is given by the following base {(f, g) ∈ (H t (M, N))2 :
                                                                1          2m

j ∈ ΛN , X is the Hilbert space over C either Cn or l2 (C), x are local normal

each partition Zk as in §2.1.3.3 (with Zk instead of Z), i ∈ ΞZk , j ∈ ΓZk ,
where ΞZk and ΓZk are finite subsets of N. We supply H γ (M, X; Zk ) with
the following metric ρk,γ (y) := [ i∈Ξ ky|Mi,k k”2 γ,i,k ]1/2 for y ∈ H γ (M, X; Zk )

for each j ∈ N.
    For a domain W in Cm , which is a complex manifold with corners, let
Y Υ,a (W, X) (and Z Υ,a (W, X)) be a subspace of those f ∈ Ȳ ∞ (W, X) (or
f ∈ Z ∞ (W, X) respectively) for which

   Using the atlases At(M) and At(N) as in §2.1 for M and N of class of

(and also Z Υ,a (M, s0 ; N, y0)) of mappings f : M → N with f (s0 ) = y0

                                                                      Υ,a
                                                                          (Mm , s0,m ; N, y0 ).
Then with the help of charts of At(M) and At(N) the space Y ξ (W, X) in-
duces the uniformity τ in Q∞         Υ,a (N, y0 ) and the completion      of it relative to τ
                        ξ
we denote by Y (M, s0 ; N, y0), where ξ = (Υ, a, c) and p∈ΛM ,j∈ΛN kfp,j −
                                                                       P

(w0 )p,j k2Y ξ (Wp,j ,X) < ∞ for each f ∈ Y ξ (M, s0 ; N, y0) is supposed to be
satisfied with w0 (M) = {y0 }, since each Mm is compact. Therefore, us-
ing classes of equivalent elements from Q∞              Υ,a (N, y0 ) and their closures in
  ξ
Y (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) as in §2.8.1 we get the corresponding loop monoids which
are denoted (S M N)ξ . With the help of A. Grothendieck construction we
get loop groups (LM N)ξ . Substituting spaces Y Υ,a over C onto Z Υ,a over
R with respective modifications we get spaces Z Υ,a,c (M, N) over R, loop
                 M
monoids (SR        N)ξ and groups (LM     R N)ξ for the multi-index ξ = (Υ, a, c).
      Let exp : T̃ N → N be the exponential mapping, where T̃ N is a neigh-
bourhood of N in T N [23].
      2.9. Theorems. (1). The space (LM N)ξ =: G for ξ = (Υ, a) or
ξ = (Υ, a, c) from §2.8 is the complete separable Abelian topological group.
Moreover, G is the dense subgroup in (LM N)O for ξ = (Υ, a); G is non-
discrete non-locally compact and locally connected.
      (2). The space X ξ (M, N) := Te (LM N)ξ is Hilbert for each 1 ≤ m =
dimC M ≤ ∞.
                                                   ′
      (3.) Let N be a complex Hilbert Y ξ -manifold with ∞ > a > a′ > 0 and
∞ > c > c′ > 0 for ξ ′ = (Υ, a′ ) or ξ ′ = (Υ, a′ , c′ ) respectively, then there
exists a mapping Ẽ : T̃ (LM N)ξ → (LM N)ξ defined by Ẽη (v) = expη(s) ◦ vη on
a neighbourhood Vη of the zero section in Tη (LM N)ξ and it is a C ∞ -mapping
           ′
for Y ξ -manifold N by v onto a neighbourhood Wη = We ◦ η of η ∈ (LM N)ξ ;
Ẽ is the uniform isomorphism of uniform spaces Vη and Wη , where s ∈ M,
e is the unit element in G, v ∈ Vη , 1 ≤ m ≤ ∞.


                                              20
     (4). (LM N)ξ is the closed proper subgroup in (LM             R N)ξ .
     Proof. There are true analogs of Propositions 2.2, 2.5 and Lemmas
2.3.1, 2.4 for the considered here classes of smoothness Y ξ defined with the
help of Gevrey classes due to Theorem VI.9 [8] and [19], using the standard
procedure of an increasing sequence of C ∞ -domains Wn in a quadrant Q with
dimC Q < ∞ such that cl( n Wn ) = Q.
                                   S

     For ξ = (Υ, a) or ξ = (Υ, a, c) classes < f >ξ are closed due to §§2.3,
2.7, 2.8 and the corresponding analog of Lemma 2.4 for the considered
class of smoothness, since the uniform spaces Y ξ (M, s0 ; N, y0) are complete.
The space Te (LMm N)O is linear, where e is the unit element of the groop
(LMm N)O . Then in particular X ξ (Mm , N) is the Banach space with kf kX ξ (Mm ,N ) =
inf y∈f kyk′ξ , where f =< y >ξ , y ∈ Y ξ (M, s0 ; X, 0). On the other hand,
X ξ (Mm , N) is isomorphic with the completion of Te (LMm N)O by the norm
kf kX ξ (Mm ,N ) . Then (ρk,γ (y 1 + y 2))2 + (ρk,γ (y 1 − y 2))2 = 2[(ρk,γ (y 1))2 +
(ρk,γ (y 2))2 ] for each y 1 , y 2 ∈ H γ (M, X; Zk ) due to the choices of ν and ρk,γ . If
y ∈ H γ (M, X; Zk ) then ρk,γ (y) = ρl,γ (y) for each l > k, since ν(M ′ l ) = 0 and
y ∈ H γ (M, X; Zl ). For each y 1, y 2 ∈ H γ p (M, s0 ; X, 0) there exists Z ∈ Υ such
that y 1, y 2 ∈ H γ (M, X; Z). Therefore, from Equality (i) in §2.7 it follows that
kf1 + f2 k2 X ξ (M,N ) + kf1 − f2 k2 X ξ (M,N ) = 2[kf1 k2 X ξ (M,N ) + kf2 k2 X ξ (M,N ) ] for
each f1 , f2 ∈ X ξ (M, N). Then kf1 + f2 k∗ 2k + kf1 − f2 k∗ 2k = 2[kf1 k∗ 2k + kf2 k∗ 2k ]
for each 0 ≤ k ∈ Z and each f1 and f2 ∈ Q∞             Υ,a (X) of §2.8, consequently, kf1 +
f2 k2X ξ (M,N ) + kf1 − f2 k2X ξ (M,N ) = 2[kf1 k2X ξ (M,N ) + kf2k2X ξ (M,N ) ]. Hence the for-
mula 4(f1 , f2 ) := kf1 + f2 k2 X ξ (M,N ) −kf1 − f2 k2 X ξ (M,N ) −ikf1 + if2 k2 X ξ (M,N ) +
ikf1 − if2 k2 X ξ (M,N ) gives the scalar product (f1 , f2 ) in X ξ (M, N) and this is
the Hilbert space over C.
     The spaces Y ξ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) and X ξ (M, N) are complete, consequently, G
is complete. The space X ξ (M, N) is separable and ΛN ⊂ N, consequently, G
is separable. The composition and the inversion in (LMm N)O induces these
operations in G, that are continuous due to §§2.3, 2.7, 2.8, consequently, G
is the Abelian topological group.
     Let β : Mm → N be a Y ξ -mapping such that β(s0 ) = y0 . If C0 is the
connected component of y0 in N then β(Mm ) ⊂ C0 . On the other hand,
N was supposed to be connected. In view of Theorems about extensions of
functions of different classes of smoothness [43, 47] (see also §2.2) and using
completions in the described above spaces there exists a neighbourhood W
of w0 such that for each f : Mm × {0, 1} → N of class Y ξ with f (Mm , 0) =


                                           21
{y0 } and f (s, 1) = β(s) for each s ∈ M there exists its Y ξ -extension f :
Mm × [0, 1] → N, where {0, 1} := {0} ∪ {1}, β ∈ W , since there exists a
neighbourhood V0 of y0 in N such that it is C 0 ([0, 1] × V0 , N)-contractible
into a point. Hence for each class < β >ξ in a sufficiently small (open)
neighbourhood of e there exists a continuous curve h : [0, 1] → G such that
h(0) = e and h(1) =< β >ξ .
    By Theorem 2.7 the tangent space Te G is infinite-dimensional over C,
consequently, G is not locally compact, where e is the unit element in G.
    Let ∇ be a covariant differentiation in N corresponding to the Levi-Civitá
connection in N due to Theorem 5.1 [15]. This is possible, since N is the
Hilbert manifold and hence has the partition of unity [25]. Therefore, there
exists the exponential mapping exp : T̃ N → N such that for each z ∈ N there
are a ball B(Tz N, 0, r) := {y ∈ Tz N : kykTz N ≤ r} and a neighbourhood
Sz of z in N for which expz : B(Tz N, 0, r) → Sz is the homeomorphism,
since φ is in the class of smoothness Y ξ due to Theorem IV.2.5 [25], where
expz w = φ(1), φ(q) is a geodesic, φ : [0, 1] → N, dφ(q)/dq|q=0 = w, φ(0) = z,
w ∈ B(Tz N, 0, r) [23].
    In view of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 [12] a mapping
    (i) E : T̃ Y ξ (Mm , s0 ; N, y0 ) → Y ξ (Mm , s0 ; N, y0 ) is a local isomorphism,
since a > b, so ∞           2
                      k=1 k (k!)
                                 b−a
                                     < ∞, where
                    P

    (ii) Eg (h) := expg(s) ◦ hg , s ∈ Mm , h ∈ T Y ξ (Mm , s0 ; N, y0 ), hg ∈
Tg Y ξ (Mm , s0 ; N, y0 ), g ∈ Y ξ (Mm , s0 ; N, y0). In view of [11, 12] the tangent
bundle T Y ξ (Mm , s0 ; N, y0) is isomorphic with Y ξ (Mm , s0 ; T N, y0 × {0}) ×
Ty0 N. Then E induces Ẽ with the help of factorisation by Rξ and the subse-
quent A. Grothendieck construction. This mapping Ẽ is of class of smooth-
ness C ∞ as follows from equations for geodesics (see §IV.3 [25]), since T T N
is the Y ξ” -manifold with a > a” > 0 and c > c” > 0. Indeed, this construc-
tion at first may be applied for (LMm N)O and then using the completion to
(LM N)ξ .
    The last statement is proved analogously to that of Theorem 2.7 using
classes of smoothness Y ξ and Z ξ .
    2.10. Notes and Definitions. Let l2,ǫ be the Hilbert space of sequences
x = (xj : xj ∈ C; j ∈ N) such that kxkl2,ǫ := { ∞                  j 2 2ǫ 1/2
                                                            j=1 |x | j }      < ∞. For
                                                          P
                                                                          Υ,b
ǫ = 0 we omit it as the index. Suppose that in the either Y -Hilbert or
        ′
Y Υ,b,d -manifold N modelled on l2 (see §2.1 and §2.8) there exists a dense
     ′            ′
Y Υ,b - or Y Υ,b ,d” -Hilbert submanifold N ′ modelled on l2,ǫ , where
    (1) ∞ > a > b > b′ > 0 and ∞ > c > d′ and either

                                         22
    (2) ∞ > ǫ > 1 and d′ ≥ d” > 0 or
    (3) ∞ > ǫ ≥ 0 and d′ > d” > 0 correspondingly.
    If N is finite-dimensional let N ′ = N. Evidently, each Y Υ,b -manifold is
the complex C ∞ -manifold. Certainly we suppose, that a class of smoothness
of a manifold N ′ is not less than that of N and classes of smoothness of M
and N are not less than that of a given loop group for it as in §2.8 and of G′
as below. Let G′ := (LM N ′ )ξ′ be a dense subgroup of G = (LM N)ξ with
    (a) ξ ′ = (Υ, a”) such that ∞ > a” > b for ξ = O and the Y Υ,b -manifolds
                          ′
M and N and the Y Υ,b -manifold N ′ ;
    (b) ξ ′ = (Υ, a”) such that a > a” > b for ξ = (Υ, a);
    (c) ξ ′ = (Υ, a”, c”) for ξ = (Υ, a, c) and dimC M = ∞ such that b <
a” < a and d′ < c” < c and either (2) ∞ > ǫ > 1 with 0 < d” ≤ d′ or (3)
                                                             ′
∞ > ǫ ≥ 0 with 0 < d” < d′ , where M and N are Y Υ,b,d -manifolds, N ′ is
           ′
the Y Υ,b ,d” -manifold, 1 ≤ dimC M =: m < ∞ in the cases (a − b). For the
corresponding pair G′ := (LM       ′               M
                               R N )ξ ′ and G := (LR N)ξ let indices in (1 − 3)
and (a − c) be the same with substitution of ξ = O on ξ = (∞, H).
    2.11. Theorem. On the group G there exists a probability quasi-
invariant measure µ relative to a dense subgroup G′ (see §2.8 and §2.10).
Moreover, this measure can be chosen ∞-continuously differentiable relative
to G′ .
    Proof. (I). From the conditions imposed on a manifold M it follows,
that there exists a partition Z of it into complex submanifolds with corners.
Then there exists Z such that the covering induced by it refines the covering
of At(M) by charts. There exist two mappings f1 (and f2 , when ∂M 6= ∅)
in OΥ (M, C) such that A3 = f1−1 (0) (and ∂M = f2−1 (0) respectively). The
manifold M is modelled on a Hilbert space X over C, so for A1 and A2 there
are quadrants Q1 and Q2 in X and surjective mappings κj : Qj → Aj such
that κj ∈ OΥ (Qj , Aj ), moreover, κj are homeomorphisms of Int(Qj ) onto
Int(Aj ) and κj (∂Qj ) = ∂Aj , where j = 1 or j = 2. On the other hand,
∂Aj = A3 ∪ (Aj ∩ ∂M). The combination of two κj and Qj produces a
quadrant Q which is OΥ -diffeomorphic to Q1 ∪ Q2 in X and a submanifold
S in Q with codimR S = 1 such that S ⊂ ∂Q1 ∪ ∂Q2 , Q1 ∩ Q2 = ∂Q1 ∩ ∂Q2 ,
κj (∂Q1 ∩ ∂Q2 ) = ∂Aj with the corresponding embeddings of Qj into X and
there exists a surjective OΥ -mapping κ : Q → M such that κ : Int(Q \ S) →
M \ (A3 ∪ ∂M) is a homeomorphism, where j = 1 or j = 2. Let v = κ(ζ)
denote points in M for each z ∈ Q.
    (II). At first we consider case (b) for G = (LM N)ξ and G′ = (LM N ′ )ξ′ .

                                      23
For the compact manifold M we can take Q up to OΥ -diffeomorphism equal to
[0, 1]2m with 0 corresponding to a marked point s0 in M. Then the measure
ν of a subset VM := {v : v ∈ M, card(κ−1 (v)) > 1} is equal to zero (see
§2.8.1). There exists a continuous mapping
      (i) K : OΥ (M, N)×OΥ (M, Ak N) → Hp∞ (M, B k M) given by the following
formula:                         R 1 R 2m
      (ii) K(F, w)(v) := 0ζ ... 0ζ (F ∗ w) := F̄ζ w, where Ak N = kj+l=0 Λ(j,l)N
                                                          R                          L

and Λ(j,l)N denotes the space of differential (j, l)-forms w on N,
w = |I|=j,|J|=l wI,J dz I ∧ dz̄ J , where dz I = dz i1 ∧ ... ∧ dz in for a multi-index
         P

I = (i1 , ..., in ), n ∈ N, |I| = i1 + .. + in , 0 ≤ ij ∈ Z, wI,J : M → C,
B k N := kj=0 Λj N. Here manifolds Ak N and B k N are considered to be of
             L

classes of smoothness O and C ∞ respectively, where Λj N is for the manifold
NR , that is the manifold N which is considered over R, Λj N is the space of
differential forms w on NR such that wI : N → C, w = I wI dxI (see also
                                                                              P

Proposition 1.6.4.2 and §1.6.5 [19]). It is correct, since M satisfies conditions
2.1.3.3(i − iv) and in local coordinates v ∈ M
                                                                  1     1          n     n        1     n+1

       s     s+n
(∂ z̄ j /∂v l ), where z = (z 1 , z 2 , ...) = F (v 1 , ..., v m ), since points v ∈ M are
paramertized with the help of (ζ 1, ..., ζ 2m ) = ζ ∈ Q, v = κ(ζ), z = (z 1 , z 2 , ...)
are local complex coordinates in N; we also write simply F̄ζ := {F ◦κ(τ ) : 0 ≤
τ j ≤ ζ j , j = 1, ..., 2m} is a set, F ∈ OΥ (M, N), w ∈ OΥ (M, Ak N), F ∗ is the
pull back generated by F (see also [9, 16, 21]). We take this mapping K, when
dimC M ≤ dimC N. When dimC M > dimC N we take w ∈ OΥ (M, Ak (N s ))
instead of OΥ (M, Ak N), where N s = N1 × ... × Ns with Nj = N for each
j = 1, ..., s such that s ≥ dimC M/dimC N, s ∈ N. A mapping F : M → N
generates a mapping F ⊗s := (F, ..., F ) : M → N s and the pull back (F ⊗s )∗
which is also denoted simply by F ∗ , where F ∗ w is a piecewise C ∞ -mapping
for the considered here classes of mappings, (F, ..., F ) is an s-tuplet.
      From the definition of Y Υ,a in §2.8 it follows that K has a continuous
extension K : Y Υ,a (M, N) × Y Υ,a (M, Ak (N s )) → Z Υ,a” (M, B k M) for each
0 < a ≤ a′′ < ∞ given by formula (ii), where M and B k M for Z Υ,a” are
considered over R, since C over R is isomorphic with R2 . This is due to
the Lebesgue Theorem     Rz
                                     about the differentiation d/dz of the Lebesgue in-
definite integral 0 f (x)dx. Let K̃ be defined on tangent spaces to these
with the help of the composition of the local diffeomorphism E given by
Formulas 2.9(i, ii) and K as above. The tangent spaces over C can also be


                                                24
considered over R. Then K̃ is continuously strongly differentiable such that
(D K̃(F, w)).(η, ψ) = K̃(η, w) + K̃(F, ψ) + K̃(F, Lη w), since Tw0 Y ξ (M, N) ⊂
T Y ξ (M, N) = Y ξ (M, T N) for w0 (M) = {y0}, also Tw0 Y ξ (M, Ak (N s )) ⊂
Y ξ (M, Ak (T (N s ))) for w0 (M) = {y0 × 0}, such that y0 × 0 ∈ Ak (N s ), where
F, η ∈ UN ⊂ Tw0 Y ξ (M, N) for ξ = (Υ, a) and w, ψ ∈ Uk ⊂ Tw0 Y ξ (M, Ak (N s )),
UN and Uk are the corresponding neighbourhoods of zero sections, Lη w is
the Lie derivative of w along η, moreover, K̃(F, w) ∈ Tw0 Z Υ,a (M, B k M).
     In view of the formula of integration on manifolds [1] : M f ∗ w = M h∗ w
                                                                    R             R

for each differential form w on N and maps f, h ∈ OΥ (M, s0 ; N, y0), when
f ∈< h >O , since a subspace of smooth functions from M to N considered
over R is dense in OΥ (M, N) and M f ∗ w is the continuous functional on
                                            R

OΥ (M, N) for each given w, where f ∗ is defined ν-almost everywhere on
M, M and N are orientable (see Introduction). If F (s0 ) = y0 it does not
imply such restriction for K(F, w)(v)|v=κ(ζ),ζ=(1,...,1). For each continuous
w 6= 0 there exists F0 ∈ Y ξ (M, N) with its closed support supp(F0 ) such
that s0 ∈ / supp(F0 ) and K(F0 , w)(v)|v=κ(ζ),ζ=(1,...,1) = (s0 ; 1, ..., 1), since there
exists s ∈ M, s 6= s0 , such that w(s) 6= 0. Thus for each w there are F0 and
a mapping Āw := Ā : Rd × Y ξ (M, N) → Y ξ (M, N) such that
     (iv) K( Ā(c, F0 ), w)(v)|v=κ(ζ),ζ=(1,...,1) = c, where c := K(F, w)(v)|v=κ(ζ),ζ=(1,...,1),

d = l=0 l = dimR Bsk0 M, k = m!/(k!(m−k)!) are binomial coefficients
(see also [9, 16] and Hodge Decomposition Theorems 7.5.3, 7.5.5 in [1]). On
the other hand, Ak (LM N)ξ = (LM Ak N)ξ × Aky0 N with the marked point
(y0 × 0) in Ak N, in particular we consider Ak (LM M)ξ as (LM Ak M)ξ × Aks0 M
which is an infinite-dimensional complex manifold even for k = m = 1 due to
Theorem 2.9.(2), since dimC Ak M > m for each 1 ≤ k ≤ m, where tradition-
ally T M := x∈M Tx M, such that dimC T M = 2×dimC M and T Ui = Ui ×X
               S

for Ui ⊂ M corresponding to the chart in M, X is the Banach space on which
M is modelled [23].
     The space Y ξ (M, N) × Y ξ (M, Ak (N s )) is isomorphic with Y ξ (M, N ×
Ak (N s )), hence E −1 ◦ K ◦ E = K̃ is defined on a neighbourhood of the zero
section in T Y ξ (M, N × Ak (N s )) into a neighbourhood of the zero section
in T Z ξ (M, B k M) for ξ = (Υ, a). The restriction of the latter mapping K̃
on the corresponding neighbourhood of the zero section in T Y ξ (M, s0 ; N ×
Ak (N s ), y0 × (y0 , 0)) and then the factorization by the equivalence relation
Rξ and the usage of A. Grothendieck construction produces the mapping K1
from the corresponding neighbourhood of the zero section in T (LM N)ξ ×

Rd , where s ≥ dimC M/dimC N.
     Therefore, using Ẽ we get a mapping K1 from Te (LM N)ξ ×Te (LM Ak (N s ))ξ
into Te (LM       k            d
             R B M)ξ × R respectively such that it is continuously strongly
differentiable with (DK1 (f, < w >)).(η, < ψ >) = K1 (η, < w >) + K1 (f, <

, < ψ >∈ Vk ⊂ Te (LM Ak (N s ))ξ , VN and Vk are the corresponding neigh-
bourhoods of zero sections. In view of the existence of the mapping Ẽ in
§2.9 for T̃ (LM N)ξ there exists the continuous mapping K̄ : We × Ve → V ′ 0
induced by Ẽ and K1 , where We is a neighbourhood of e in (LM N)ξ , Ve
is a neighbourhood of the zero section in Te (LM Ak (N s ))ξ for the unit el-
ement e in (LM Ak (N s ))ξ , V ′ 0 is a neighbourhood of zero in the Hilbert
space Te (LM        k            d
               R B M)ξ × R over R. On the other hand, we can use the
mapping χ from §2.1.4. This mapping χ∗ induces the tangent mapping
               ∗

T χ∗ : T Y ξ ((M)1 ∨ (M)2 , s0 ; N, y0) → T Y ξ (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) such that χ∗ is in
the class of smoothness C ∞ . Therefore, there is the linear mapping (differ-
ential ) Dχ∗ (h) : Th Y ξ ((M)1 ∨ (M)2 , s0 ; N, y0 ) → F for each h ∈ Y ξ ((M)1 ∨
(M)2 , s0 ; N, y0 ), where F is the Hilbert space such that Tz Y ξ (M, s0 ; N, y0) =
{z} × F for each z ∈ Y ξ (M, s0 ; N, y0), in particular for z = χ∗ (h) (see [23]).
     Then we define by induction the following mapping
     (v) Ψl,M,N (f, < w >) := Ψ1,M,M (Ψl−1,M,N (idM , K̄(f, < w >)), where
Ψ1,M,N (f, < w >) := K̄(f, < w >, Ψ1,M,M is defined analogously to Ψ1,M,N ,
but with M over R instead of N over C, that is Ψ1,M,M : (LM                        R M)ξ ×

                                                             due    to Formula   (iv), idM :
M → M is the identity mapping, idM (z) = z for each z ∈ M.
     For a sequence of Hilbert spaces Pq all over either C or R with q ∈

since (d)2ǫ kxk2 l2,ǫ ({Cd q :q∈N}) ≥ kxk2 l2,ǫ ≥ kxk2 l2,ǫ ({Cd q :q∈N}) for each x ∈ l2,ǫ .

infinite-dimensional N or J = {1} for finite-dimensional N. Let l ≥ 2 be

πq : Pq ֒→ l2 ({Pq : q ∈ J}) are the natural embeddings with eq ∈ πq (Pq )
and keq kl2 ({Pq :q∈J}) = 1 for each q ∈ J. Therefore, due to formulas (ii − v)
there exists a family {< w i,q >: i = 1, ..., d; q ∈ J} ⊂ Te (LM Ak (N ′ )s )Υ,β”
for 0 < b < β” < a” < ∞, where k = 2m = dimR M, < w i,q > are the
corresponding classes of equivalent elements, such that the mapping
                             d
                                      Ψl,M,N (f, < w i,q >)eq ∈ l2 ({Pq : q ∈ J})

is injective. Due to Theorem 2.9(3) about properties of Ẽ and the open
mapping Theorem (14.4.1) [41] the mapping Ψl is the diffeomorphism of a
suitable neighbourhood Ue of the unit element e ∈ (LM N)ξ (considered as
the manifold over R) onto a neighbourhood V0 of 0 in the corresponding
Hilbert subspace K0 in l2 ({Pq : q ∈ J}). Let the image V0 of Ue be supplied
with the strongest uniformity relative to which Ψl is uniformly continuous,
that produces the Hilbert space K0 = j∈N jV0 .
                                           S

    This follows from the consideration of a space Zqγ (M, X) for dimC M < ∞
which is defined to be the completion of a subspace f ∈ Z γ+qm (M, X) for
which D α f (v)|( there exists j with vj =sj ) = 0 relative to the following norm
                                                 0
     kf kZqγ (M,X) := ( (α=(α1 ,...,αm);0≤αj ≤q for each j=1,...,m) kD α f k2 Z γ (M,X) )1/2 ,
                        P

where 0 ≤ q ∈ Z. In this class of smoothness analogously to §2.8 we get
spaces Zqγ (M, N), such that Zqγ (M, s0 ; N, y0) = {f ∈ Zqγ (M, N) : f (s0 ) = y0 }
and < f >qγ := cl(< f >R                                         γ
                              γ+qm ) with the closure in Zq (M, s0 ; N, y0 ), where
         R                                                 γ
< f >γ are classes of equvalent elements in Z (M, s0 ; N, y0). Then we
consider a loop group (LM N)qγ constructed from the loop monoid (S M N)qγ :=
Yqγ (M, s0 ; N, y0 )/Rγq and a Hilbert space Xqγ (M, N) := Te (LM N)qγ , where Rγq
is the equivalence relation generated by classes < f >qγ .
     Then the mapping Ψl : Ue → K0 given by Formula (vi) is continuously
strongly differentiable. There exist neighbourhoods V ′ ∋ e in G′ and Uξ ∋ e
in G such that V ′ ◦ Uξ ⊂ Ue . We consider next a mapping Sφ (v) := Ψl ◦
Lφ ◦ Ψl −1 (v)− v with v ∈ Vξ , φ ∈ V ′ , where Vξ = Ψl (Uξ ) and Lφ (f ) := φ ◦ f
denotes an operator of the left shift in G. Then either (α) Sφ (Vξ ) ⊂ l2,ǫ ({P ′q :
q ∈ J}) for each φ ∈ V ′ , where P ′ q = Te (LM       k              ld
                                                  R B M)Υ,a′′ × R with 1 < ǫ < ∞
and 0 < d” ≤ d′ for each q ∈ J; or (β) Sφ (Vξ ) ⊂ l2,ǫ ({P ”q : q ∈ J}) for
each φ ∈ V ′ with 0 ≤ ǫ < ∞ and 0 < d” < d′ , where P ”q = P ′ q and

kf kP ”q = kf kP ′q (q!)d −d” is the relation between norms of f in P ”q and P ′ q
respectively for each q.
    For an open interval J ⊂ R and two Banach spaces E, F and open
subset U, U ⊂ E, if f : J × U → F is continuous and Dz f (φ, z) is continuous
in J × U, if also α and β are two continuously differentable mappings of
                               R β(z)
U into J, then g(z) := α(z) f (φ, z)dφ is continuously differentiable in U
                                                            R β(z)
such that Dg(z) is the linear mapping Dg(z)(h) = ( α(z) Dz f (φ, z)dφ)h+
(Dβ(z)(h))f (β(z), z)− (Dα(z)(h))f (α(z), z) [1]. From Formulas (ii − vi)
it follows that Sφ (v) is strongly continuosly differentiable by v ∈ V0 for
each φ ∈ V ′ . Moreover, ∂Sφ (v)/∂v = P̂2 P̂1 , where (P̂2 )η for sufficiently
large η ∈ N and P̂1 are operators of trace class for each φ ∈ V ′ and v ∈
Vξ such that P̂1 : K0 → X ′ , P̂2 : X ′ → l2,ǫ ({P ′ q : q ∈ J}), X ′ is the
corresponding Hilbert space, P̂1 (K0 ) = X ′ . It follows from the fact that
Y Υ,a (M, N) ⊃ Y Υ,b” (M, N) ⊃ Y Υ,b” (M, N ′ ) for each 0 < b′ < b < b” <
a < ∞ such that the corresponding operators of embeddings are of trace
class, since j∈N (j!)b−a” j l < ∞ and either j∈N j −ǫ < ∞ for ǫ > 1 or
                    P                                 P
P∞          b′ −b
   j=1 (j!)         < ∞. In the case of (LM N)Υ,a using cylindrical functions (see
below) the desired measure can be induced from the corresponding Hilbert
subspace X ′ either (α) in l2,ǫ−δ” ({P̃q : q ∈ J}) such that P̃q = Te (LMR M)Υ,a” ×
Rld for each q, where 0 < d” ≤ d′ and 1 < ǫ − δ” < ǫ; or (β) in l2,ǫ ({P̄q :
q ∈ J}) with 0 < d” < d′ and 0 ≤ ǫ < ∞, where P̄q = P̃q such that
                          ′
kf kP̄q = kf kP̃q (q!)d −d” for each f ∈ P̄q and each q ∈ J.
    There exists a Gaussian quasimeasure λ on X ′ . It induces a Gaussian
probability measure ν on K0 with the help of an operator of trace class
P̂1 : K0 → X ′ [10, 44]. This measure induces a measure µ̃ on Uξ with the
help of Ψl such that µ̃(A) = ν(Ψl (A)) for each A ∈ Bf (Uξ ), since ν(V0 ) > 0.
The groups G and G′ are separable and metrizable, hence there exist locally
finite coverings {φi ◦Wi : i ∈ N} of G and {φi ◦W ′i : i ∈ N} of G′ with φi ∈ G′
such that Wi are open subsets in Uξ , W ′i are open subsets in V ′ , where φ1 = e
and W1 = Uξ , e ∈ W ′ i ⊂ Wi for each i [13], that is i∈N φi ◦ Wi = G and
                                                               S
                 ′      ′
  i∈N φi ◦ W       i = G . Then µ̃ can be extended onto G by the following formula
S

µ(A) := ( i=1 µ̃((φi −1 ◦ A) ∩ Wi )2−i )/( ∞
              P∞                                            −i
                                                i=1 µ̃(Wi )2 ) for each A ∈ Bf (G).
                                              P

In view of Theorems 26.1 and 26.2 [44] this µ can be chosen quasi-invariant
on G relative to G′ .
    Therefore, to verify differentiability of µ it is sufficient to consider µ
on W1 and with φ ∈ V ” for open V ” in G′ , e ∈ V ” ⊂ V ′ , such that

                                        28
kDφ Sφ (v)(Xφ )k < c̄ × kvkK0 × kXφ kTφ G′ for each φ ∈ V ”, where 0 <
c̄ = const < 1. From the above construction and the formula for the
quasi-invariance factor ρµ (φ, g) with the help of Ψl we get that µ is ∞-
continuously differentiable relative to G′ , since Ψl is also ∞-continuously
strongly differentiable due to Theorems 2.9. Indeed, µφ (E) = E µφ (dg)
                                                                          R

= E ρµ (φ, g)µ(dg), hence Dφ µφ (E)(Xφ ) = E {Dφ ρµ (φ, g)(Xφ )}µ(dg), since
    R                                              R

D k φ ρµ ( φ, g)(X1,φ, ..., Xk,φ ) ∈ L2 (G, µ, R). The latter is due to Ψl ∈ C ∞
and since νφ (A) := ν(Uφ−1 (A)) is ∞-continuously differentiable by φ ∈
G′ , where A ∈ Af (Vξ , ν) and Uφ (v) := v + Sφ (v). This follows from the
facts that det(Uφ′ ) > 0 for each φ ∈ V ′′ , this determinant and Uφ−1 and
                      −1                        −1
exp{ ∞                                                   2
         j=1 [2(x−Uφ (x), ej )(x, ej )−(x−Uφ (x), ej ) ]/λj } are ∞-continuously
       P
                             ′
differentiable by φ ∈ G , where ej and λj are the eigenvectors and eigenval-
ues of the correlation operator (self-adjoint nondegenerate positive definite
operator of trace class on the real separable Hilbert space) of the Gaussian
measure ν with mean 0, x ∈ K0 .
     (III). Let now G = (LM                     ′    M ′
                                R N)∞,H and G = (LR N )Υ,a” . Let ∞ > a > a” >
                                                  M
b and the measure (denoted by ) µ̃ on (LR N)Υ,a =: G1 be from §2.11.(II)
quite analogously to the complex case substituting OΥ (M, N) on Hp∞ (M, N)
and OΥ (M, Ak (N s )) on Hp∞ (M, B k (N s )). Since by the corresponding analog
of Theorem 2.9(1) G1 is the dense subgroup of G, the measure µ̃ on G1
induces the measure µ on G such that µ(Q) = µ̃(Q̃), where Q̃ := [x ∈ G1 :
(h1 (x), ..., hs (x)) ∈ R], Q := [x ∈ G : (h1 (x), ..., hs (x)) ∈ R], R ∈ Bf (Rs ),
hi ∈ {h : G → R, h are continuous}, the real field R is considered with the
standard norm. Indeed, the minimal σ-fields over G1 and G generated by such
Q̃ and Q coincide with the Borel σ-fields Bf (G1 ) and Bf (G) respectively.
If Q1 ∩ Q2 = ∅ for such Qj then Q̃1 ∩ Q̃2 = ∅, hence µ is additive and has
σ-additive extension on Bf (G), since the uniformity in G1 is stronger than
in G.
     Then the spaces Cb0 (G, R) and Cb0 (G1 , R) of bounded continuous func-
tions h : G → R and h : G1 → R are separable such that khkCb0 (G,R) :=
supx∈G |h(x)| < ∞. There exists a countable family {hj : j ∈ N} =: F which
is dense in Cb0 (G1 , R) and in Cb0 (G, R), since if f ∈ Cb0 (G, R) then its restric-
tion f |G1 ∈ Cb0 (G1 , R). The groups G and G1 are separable, consequently,
we can take F separating points in G and in G1 , since each h ∈ Cb0 (G, R)
is entirely defined by its values on a countable dense subset of G. We may
define the following subsets of open W1 in G1 and open W in G, such that


                                         29
W ∩ G1 =: W1 , W (k, c; f ) := [g ∈ W : ρ(k; g, f ) ≤ c] and W1 (k, c; f ) :=
[g ∈ W1 : ρ(k; g, f ) ≤ c], where ∞ > c > 0, k ∈ N, f ∈ W1 , the mappings
ρ(k, k ′ ; g, f ) := h∈F (k,k′) |h(g) − h(f )|; F (k, k ′ ) := {hj ∈ F : j = k, ..., k ′ }
                      P

for each k ′ > k; ρ(k; g, f ) := ρ(1, k; f, g), so W (k + 1, c; f ) ⊂ W (k, c; f )
for each k ∈ N. Therefore, ∩{W (k, 1/k; f ) : k ∈ N} = {f }, whence the
least σ-field A generated by the following family V := {W (k, c; f ) : c >
0, k ∈ N, f ∈ W, W ⊂ G, W is open} is such that A ⊃ Bf (G). More-
over, ∞
                 T∞ S
           k=1 ( m=1 ( n>m W (k, 1/k; fn ))) = {f } for each f ∈ W and each
        T

sequence {fn } ⊂ W converging to f . Hence µ(W (k, c; f )) := µ̃(W1 (k, c; f ))
for each c > 0, f ∈ W1 , k ∈ N. From the Definition of µ̃ it follows that
µ( ∞
           T∞ S
     k=1 [ m=1 [ n>m W (k, 1/k; fn )]]) = 0, consequently, µ is countably addi-
   T

tive on Bf (G).
     Then with the help of such cylindrical subsets we get that a derivative
Dφk µ̃(W1 (j, 1/j; fn ))(X1,φ , ..., Xk,φ) for each φ ∈ G′ and Xi,φ ∈ Ξ(G′ ) in-
duces a measure on the family of cylindrical subsets of G coinciding with
Dφk µ(W (j, 1/j; fn ))(X1,φ , ..., Xk,φ) and it has the extension up to the σ-additive
measure on A. Therefore, µ on G is quasi-invariant and ∞-continuouisly dif-
ferentiable relative to G′ ; analogously for G = (LM N)O and G′ = (LM N ′ )Υ,a”
     (IV). Consider now the case of dimC M = ∞ for G = (LM N)ξ and
G′ = (LM N ′ )ξ′ . If f ∈ Y Υ,a (Mm , s0 ; X, 0) then f is independent from local
complex coordinates v j for each j > n(m) = dimC Mm , consequently, D α f =
0 if there is αj > 0 for l > j > n(m), where α = (α1 , ..., αl ). Let νm
denotes the measure ν defined on Mm in §2.8, where νm (Mm ) = 1. Hence
f ∈ Y Υ,a,c (X, 0). Let A∞ N be a Y Υ,b,d -submanifold of ∞

ate the mapping K̄ : We × Ve → V ′ 0 , where We is a neighbourhood of e

Let l2,δ ({Pq : q ∈ N}) be the same as in §2.11(II) and Pq be equal to

3     Unitary representations of loop groups.
3.1. Theorem. Let µ be a quasi-invariant relative to G′ measure on
(G, Bf (G)) as in Theorem 2.11. Assume also that H := L2 (G, µ, C) is
the standard Hilbert space of equivalence classes of square-integrable (by µ)
functions f : G → C. Then there exists a strongly continuous injective ho-
momorphism T µ : G′ → U(H), where U(H) is the unitary group on H in
a topology induced from a Banach space L(H) of continuous linear operators
A : H → H supplied with the operator norm.
    Proof. Let f and h be in H, their scalar product is given by (f, h) :=
   h̄(g)f (g)µ(dg), where f and h : G → C, h̄ denotes complex conjugated h.
R
 G
There exists the regular representation T := T µ : G′ → U(H) defined by the
following formula (see §2.1.1):
                        T µ (z)f (g) := [ρµ (z, g)]1/2 f (z −1 g).

For each fixed z the quasi-invariance factor ρµ (z, g) is continuous by g, hence
T (z)f (g) is measurable, if f (g) is measurable (relative to Af (G, µ) and
Bf (C)). Therefore, (T (z)f (g), T (z)h(g)) = G h̄(z −1 g)f (z −1 g)ρµ (z, g)µ(dg) =
                                                      R

(f, h), consequently, T is unitary. From µz ′ z (dg)/µ(dg) = ρµ (z ′ z, g) = ρµ (z, (z ′ )−1
g)ρµ (z ′ , g) = [µz ′ z (dg)/µz ′ (dg)][µz ′ (dg)/µ(dg)] it follows that T (z ′ )T (z) =
T (z ′ z) and T (id) = I, T (z −1 ) = T −1 (z).

                                           32
    The embedding of Te G′ into Te G is the operator of trace class. The
measure µ on G is induced by the Gaussian measure on the corresponding
separable Hilbert space K0 over R. In view of Theorems 26.1 and 26.2 [44]
for each δ > 0 and      {f1 , ..., fn } ⊂ H there exists a compact subset B in
               Pn R
G such that i=1 G\B |fi (g)|2µ(dg) < δ 2 . Therefore, there exists an open
neighbourhood W ′ of e in G′ and an open neighbourhood S of e in G such
that ρµ (z, g) is continuous and bounded on W ′ × W ′ ◦ S, where S ⊂ W ′ ◦
S ⊂ G. In view of this, Theorems 2.9 and 2.11 and the Hölder inequality
limj→∞ ni=1 k(T (z j ) − I)fi kH = 0 for each sequence {z j : j ∈ N} converging
         P

to e in G′ , limj→∞ z j = e, where I is the unit operator on H. Indeed, for
each v > 0 and a continuous function f : G → C with kf kH = 1 there
is an open neighbourhood V of id in G′ (in the topology of G′ ), such that
|ρ(z, g) − 1| < v for each z ∈ V and each g ∈ F for some open F in G, id ∈ F
with µfz (G \ F ) < v for each z ∈ V , where µf (dg) := |f (g)|µ(dg). At first
this can be done analogously for the corresponding Banach space from which
µ was induced, where f ∈ {f1 , ..., fn }, n ∈ N.
    In H continuous functions f (g) are dense, hence | G |f (g)−f (z −1 g)(ρµ (z, g))1/2 |2
                                                         R

µ(dg)| < 4v for each finite family {fj } with kf kH = 1 and z ∈ V ′ = V ∩ V ”,
where V ” is an open neighbourhood of id in G′ such that kf (g)−f (z −1 g)kH <
v for each z ∈ V ”, 0 < v < 1, consequently T is strongly continuous (that is,
T is continuous relative to the strong topology on U(H) induced from L(H),
see its definition in [14] ).
    Moreover, T is injective, since for each g 6= id there is f ∈ C 0 (G, C) ∩ H,
such that f (id) = 0, f (g) = 1, and kf kH > 0, so T (f ) 6= I.
    3.2. Note. In general T is not continuous relative to the norm topology
on U(H), since for each z 6= id ∈ G′ and each 1/2 > v > 0 there is f ∈ H
with kf kH = 1, such that kf − T (z)f kH > v, when supp(f ) is sufficiently
small with (z ◦ supp(f )) ∩ supp(f ) = ∅.
    3.3. Theorem. Let G be a loop group with a real probability quasi-
invariant measure µ relative to a dense subgroup G′ as in Theorem 2.11.
Then µ may be chosen such that the associated regular unitary representation
of G′ is irreducible.
    Proof. Let a measure ν on the Hilbert space K0 be of the same type
as in the proof of Theorem 2.11. Let a ν-measurable function f : H → C
be such that ν({x ∈ K0 : f (x + y) 6= f (x)} = 0 for each y ∈ X0 with f ∈
L1 (H, ν, C), where ν is quasi-invariant relative to shifts from a dense linear
subspace X0 in K0 . Let also Pk : l2 → L(k) be projectors such that Pk (x) =

                                        33
xk for each x = ( j∈N xj ej ), where xk := kj=1 xj ej , xk ∈ L(k), L(k) :=
                     P                             P

spR (e1 , ..., ek ), spR (ej : j ∈ N) := {y : y ∈ l2 ; y = nj=1 xj ej ; xj ∈ R; n ∈ N}.
                                                          P

Since K0 is isomorphic with l2 , then each finite-dimensional subspace L(k)
is complemented in K0 [41]. From the proof of Proposition II.3.1 [10] in
view of the Fubini Theorem there exists a sequence of cylindrical functions
fk (x) = fk (xk ) = K0 ⊖L(k) f (Pk x + (I − Pk )y)νI−Pk (dy) which converges to f
                       R

in L1 (K0 , ν, C), where ν = νL(k) ⊗ νI−Pk , νI−Pk is the measure on K0 ⊖ L(k).
Each cylindrical function fk is ν-almost everywhere constant on K0 , since
L(k) ⊂ X0 for each k ∈ N, consequently, f is ν-almost everywhere constant
on K0 . Let A := Ψl : Ue → V0 be the same as in §2.11. From the construction
of G′ and µ with the help of the local diffeomorphism A and ν it follows that,
if a function f ∈ L1 (G, µ, C) satisfies the following condition f h (g) = f (g)
(mod µ) by g ∈ G for each h ∈ G′ , then f (x) = const (mod µ), where
f h (g) := f (hg), g ∈ G.
     Let f (g) = ChU (g) be the characteristic function of a subset U, U ⊂ G,
U ∈ Af (G, µ), then f (hg) = 1 ⇔ g ∈ h−1 U. If f h (g) = f (g) is true by
g ∈ G µ-almost everywhere, then µ({g ∈ G : f h (g) 6= f (g)}) = 0, that is
µ((h−1 U) △ U) = 0, consequently, the measure µ satisfies the condition (P )
from §VIII.19.5 [14], where A △ B := (A \ B) ∪ (B \ A) for each A, B ⊂ G.
For each subset E ⊂ G the outer measure is bounded, µ∗ (E) ≤ 1, since
µ(G) = 1 and µ is non-negative [6], consequently, there exists F ∈ Bf (G)
such that F ⊃ E and µ(F ) = µ∗ (E). This F may be interpreted as the
least upper bound in Bf (G) relative to the latter equality. In view of the
Proposition VIII.19.5 [14] the measure µ is ergodic, that is for each U ∈
Af (G, µ) and F ∈ Af (G, µ) with µ(U) × µ(F ) 6= 0 there exists h ∈ G′ such
that µ((h ◦ E) ∩ F ) 6= 0.
     From Theorem I.1.2 [10] it follows that (G, Bf (G)) is a Radon space,
since G is separable and complete. Therefore, a class of compact subsets
approximates from below each measure µf , µf (dg) := |f (g)|µ(dg), where
f ∈ L2 (G, µ, C) =: H. Due to the Egorov Theorem II.1.11 [14] for each ǫ > 0
and for each sequence fn (g) converging to f (g) for µ-almost every g ∈ G,
when n → ∞, there exists a compact subset K in G such that µ(G\K) < ǫ and
fn (g) converges on K uniformly by g ∈ K, when n → ∞. In each Hilbert space
L2 (Rn , λ, R) the linear span of functions f (x) = exp[(b, x) −(ax, x)] is dense,
where b and x ∈ Rn , a is a real symmetric positive definite n×n matrix, (∗, ∗)
is the standard scalar product in Rn and λ is the Lebesgue measure on Rn . If

a non-linear operator U on K0 satisfies conditions of Theorem 26.1 [44], then
ν U (dx)/ν(dx) = |detU ′ (U −1 (x))|ρν (x−U −1 (x), x), where ν U (B) := ν(U −1 B)
for each B ∈ Bf (K0 ), ρν (z, x) = exp{ ∞                                               2

Theorem 26.2 [44], where λl and el are eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the
correlation operator P̂1 : K0 → X ′ enumerated by l ∈ N, z ∈ X0 , ρν (z, x) :=
νz (dx)/ν(dx), νz (B) := ν(B − z) for each B ∈ Bf (K0 ). Hence in view of
the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem A.8 [14] an algebra V(Q) of finite pointwise
products of functions from the following space spC {ψ(g) := (ρ(h, g))1/2 : h ∈
G′ } =: Q is dense in H, since ρµ (e, g) = 1 for each g ∈ G and Lh : G → G
are diffeomorphisms of the manifold G, Lh (g) = hg.
      For each m ∈ N there are C ∞ -curves φbj ∈ G′ ∩ W , where j = 1, ..., m
and b ∈ (−2, 2) := {a : −2 < a < 2; a ∈ R} is a parameter, such that
φbj |b=0 = e and φj := φ1j and vectors (∂φbj /∂b)|b=0 for j = 1, ..., m are linearly
independent in Te G′ . Then the following condition det(Ψ(g)) = 0 defines a
submanifold GΨ in G of codimension over R,
      (i) codimR GΨ ≥ 1, where Ψ(g) is a matrix dependent from g ∈ G
with matrix elements Ψl,j (g) := Dφ2lj (ρ(φj , g))1/2 . If f ∈ H is such that
(f (g), (ρ(φ, g))1/2)H = 0 for each φ ∈ G′ ∩ W , then differentials of these
scalars products by φ are zero. But V(Q) is dense in H and in view of con-
dition (i) this means that f = 0, since for each m there are φj ∈ G′ ∩ W
such that detΨ(g) 6= 0 µ-almost everywhere on G, g ∈ G. If kf kH > 0, then
µ(supp(f )) > 0, consequently, µ(G′ supp(f )) = 1, since G′ U = G for each
open U in G and for each ǫ > 0 there exists an open U, U ⊃ supp(f ), such
that µ(U \ supp(f )) < ǫ.
      This means that the vector f0 is cyclic, where f0 ∈ H and f0 (g) = 1
for each g ∈ G. From the construction of µ it follows that for each f1,j and
f2,j ∈ H with j = 1, ..., n, n ∈ N and each ǫ > 0 there exists h ∈ G′ such that
|(Th f1,j , f2,j )H | ≤ ǫ|(f1,j , f2,j )H |, when |(f1,j , f2,j )H | > 0, since G is the Radon
space by Theorem I.1.2 [10] and G is not locally compact. This means that
there is not any finite-dimensional G′ -invariant subspace H ′ in H such that
Th H ′ ⊂ H ′ for each h ∈ G′ and H ′ 6= {0}. Hence if there is a G′ -invariant
closed subspace H ′ 6= 0 in H it is isomorphic with the subspace L2 (V, µ, C),
where V ∈ Bf (G) with µ(V ) > 0.
      Let AG denotes a ∗-subalgebra of L(H) generated by the family of unitary

    We suppose that λ is a probability Radon measure on G′ such that λ has

regular representation there exists the S. Bochner integral G Th f (g)µ(dg) for
each f ∈ H, which implies its existence in the weak (B. Pettis) sence. The
measures µ and λ are non-negative and bounded, hence H ⊂ L1 (G, µ, C)
and L2 (G′ , λ, C) ⊂ L1 (G′ , λ, C) due to the Cauchy inequality. Therefore,
we can apply below the Fubini Theorem (see §II.16.3 [14]). Let f ∈ H,
then there exists a countable orthonormal base {f j : j ∈ N} in H ⊖ Cf .
Then   for each n ∈ N the following set Bn := {q ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C) : (f j , f )H =
           j
 G′ q(h)(f , Th f0 )H λ(dh) for j = 0, ..., n} is non-empty, since the vector f0 is
R

cyclic, where f 0 := f . There exists ∞ > R > kf kH such that Bn ∩ B R =:
BnR is non-empty and weakly compact for each n ∈ N, since B R is weakly
compact, where B R := {q ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C) : kqk ≤ R} (see the Alaoglu-
Bourbaki Theorem in §(9.3.3) [41]). Therefore, BnR is a centered system of
closed subsets of B R , that is, ∩m        R
                                   n=1 Bn 6= ∅ for each m ∈ N, hence it has a
non-empty intersection, consequently, there exists q ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C) such that
                                           Z
                         (ii) f (g) =             q(h)Th f0 (g)λ(dh)
                                             G′

for µ-a.e. g ∈ G. If F ∈ L∞ (G, µ, C), f1 and f2 ∈ H, then there exist q1 and
q2 ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C) satisfying Equation (ii). Therefore,
                             Z Z      Z
(iii) (f1 , F f2 )H =: c =                 q̄1 (h1 )q2 (h2 )ρµ1/2 (h1 , g)ρ1/2
                                                                           µ (h2 , g)F (g)λ(dh1)λ(dh2 )µ(dg).

Let ξ(h) := G G′ G′ q̄1 (h1 )q2 (h2 )ρµ1/2 (h1 , g)ρµ1/2 (hh2 , g)λ(dh1)λ(dh2 )µ(dg). Then
             R R    R

there exists β(h) ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C) such that
    (iv) G′ β(h)ξ(h)λ(dh) = c.
         R

To prove this we consider two cases. If c = 0 it is sufficient to take β
orthogonal to ξ in L2 (G′ , λ, C). Each function q ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C) can be written
as q = q 1 − q 2 + iq 3 − iq 4 , where q j (h) ≥ 0 for each h ∈ G′ and j = 1, ..., 4,
hence we obtain the corresponding decomposition for ξ, ξ = j,k bj,k ξ j,k ,
                                                                           P

where ξ j,k corresponds to q1j and q2k , where bj,k ∈ {1, −1, i, −i}. If c 6= 0 we
can choose (j0 , k0 ) for which ξ j0 ,k0 6= 0 and
    (v) β is orthogonal to others ξ j,k with (j, k) 6= (j0 , k0 ).
Otherwise, if ξ j,k = 0 for each (j, k), then qlj (h) = 0 for each (l, j) and λ-a.e.

                                                  36
h ∈ G′ , since ξ(0) = G µ(dg)( G′ q̄1 (h1 )ρµ1/2 (h1 , g)λ(dh1))( G′ q2 (h2 )ρ1/2
                                                                              µ (h2 , g)λ(

dh2 )) = 0 and this implies c = 0, which is the contradiction with the assump-
tion c 6= 0. Hence there exists β satisfying conditions (iv, v).
     Let a(x) ∈ L∞ (G, µ, C), f and g ∈ H, β(h) ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C). Since
L2 (G′ , λ, C) is infinite-dimensional, then for each finite family of a ∈ {a1 , ..., am } ⊂
L∞ (G, µ, C), f ∈ {f1 , ..., fm } R⊂ H there exists β(h) ∈ L2 (G′ , λ, C), h ∈ G′ ,
such that β is orthogonal to G f¯s (g)[fj (h−1 g)(ρµ (h, g))1/2 − fj (g)]µ(dg) for
each s, j = 1, ..., m. Hence each operator of multiplication on aj (g) be-
longs to AG ”, since due toR Formula        (iv) and Condition (v) there exists
                                       ¯
β(h) such that (fs , aj fl ) = G G′ fs (g)β(h)(ρµ (h, g))1/2 fl ( h−1 g)λ(dh)µ(dg)

β(h) fl (g)λ(dh)µ(dg) = (fs , aj fl ). Hence AG ” contains subalgebra of all op-
erators of multiplication on functions from L∞ (G, µ, C).
     Let us remind the following. A Banach bundle B over a Hausdorff space
G is a bundle < B, π > over G′ , together with operations and norms making
  ′

each fiber Bh (h ∈ G′ ) into a Banach space such that conditions BB(i − iv)
are satisfied: BB(i) x 7→ kxk is continuous on B to R; BB(ii) the operation
+ is continuous as a function on {(x, y) ∈ B ×B : π(x) = π(y)} to B; BB(iii)
for each λ ∈ C, the map x 7→ λx is continuous on B to B; BB(iv) if h ∈ G′
and {xi } is any net of elements of B such that kxi k → 0 and π(xi ) → h in G′ ,
then xi → 0h in B, where π : B → G′ is a bundle projection, Bh := π −1 (h) is
the fiber over h (see §II.13.4 [14]). If G′ is a Hausdorff topological group, then
a Banach algebraic bundle over G′ is a Banach bundle B =< B, π > over
G′ together with a binary operation • on B satisfying conditions AB(i − v):
AB(i) π(b • c) = π(b)π(c) for b and c ∈ B; AB(ii) for each x and y ∈ G′
the product • is bilinear on Bx × By to Bxy ; AB(iii) the product • on B
is associative; AB(iv) kb • ck ≤ kbk × kck (b, c ∈ B); AB(v) the map • is
continuous on B ×B to B (see §VIII.2.2 [14]). With G′ and a Banach algebra
A the trivial Banach bundle B = A×G′ is associative, in particular let A = C
(see §VIII.2.7 [14]).
     The regular representation T of G′ gives rise to a canonical regular H-
projection-valued measure P̄ : P̄ (W )f = ChW f , where f ∈ H, W ∈ Bf (G),
ChW is the characteristic function of W . Therefore, Th P̄ (W ) = P̄ (h ◦ W )Th
for each h ∈ G′ and W ∈ Bf (G), since ρµ (h, h−1 ◦ g)ρµ (h, g) = 1 = ρµ (e, g)
for each (h, g) ∈ G′ × G, ChW (h−1 ◦ g) = Chh◦W (g) and Th (P̄ (W )f (g)) =
ρµ (h, g)1/2 P̄ (h ◦ W )f (h−1 ◦ g). Thus < T, P̄ > is a system of imprimitivity
for G′ over G, which is denoted Tµ . This means that conditions SI(i − iii)

                                         37
are satisfied: SI(i) T is a unitary representation of G′ ; SI(ii) P̄ is a regular
H-projection-valued Borel measure on G and SI(iii) Th P̄ (W ) = P̄ (h ◦ W )Th
for all h ∈ G′ and W ∈ Bf (G).
    For each F ∈ L∞ (G, µ, C) let ᾱF be the operator in L(H) consisting of
multiplication by F : ᾱF (f ) = F f for each f ∈ H. The map F → ᾱF is
an isometric ∗-isomorphism of L∞ (G, µ, C) into L(H) (see §VIII.19.2[14]).
Therefore, Propositions VIII.19.2,5[14] (using the approach of this particular
case given above) are applicable in our situation.
    If p̄ is a projection onto a closed Tµ -stable subspace of H, then p̄ com-
mutes with all P̄ (W ). Hence p̄ commutes with multiplication by all F ∈
L∞ (G, µ, C), so by §VIII.19.2 [14] p̄ = P̄ (V ), where V ∈ Bf (G). Also p̄
commutes with all Th , h ∈ G′ , consequently, (h ◦ V ) \ V and (h−1 ◦ V ) \ V
are µ-null for each h ∈ G′ , hence µ((h ◦ V ) △ V ) = 0 for all h ∈ G′ . In
view of ergodicity of µ and Proposition VIII.19.5 [14] either µ(V ) = 0 or
µ(G \ V ) = 0, hence either p̄ = 0 or p̄ = I, where I is the unit operator.
Hence T is the irreducible unitary representation.
    3.4. Theorem. There exists a bounded intertwining operator V : L2 (G, µ, C) →
                                        ′
L2 (G, µ′, C) such that V T µ (ψ) = T µ (ψ)V for each ψ ∈ G′ if and only if µ
and µ′ are equivalent, where µ and µ′ are quasi-invaraint measures on G rela-
tive to G′ and T µ is the associated regular representation of G′ from Theorems
3.1 and 3.3.
    Proof. If µ is equivalent with µ′ , then µ(dg)/µ′(dg) := φ(g) is µ-a.e
positive, which produces an intertwining operator V , which is an isomorphism
V : L2 (G, µ, C) → L2 (G, µ′, C) given by the following formula: f (g) 7→
f (g)φ(g).
    It remains to verify the reverse implication. In view of Theorem 3.3
representations T µ are irreducible. It was proved in §3.3 that
    (i) the weak closure of subalgebra generated by the family {T µ (h) :
h ∈ G′ } in the algebra of bounded linear operators L(H) contains all op-
erators of multiplication on functions from the space L∞ (G, µ, C), where
H := L2 (G, µ, C). If measures µ and µ′ are singular, then
    (ii) either sup(g∈G) |µ′ (dg)/µ(dg)| = ∞ or sup(g∈G) |µ(dg)/µ′(dg)| = ∞,
where µ′ (dg)/µ(dg) := lim(µ(B)→0,∞>µ(B)>0,g∈B) µ′ (B)/µ(B) ∈ [0, ∞], [0, ∞] :=
([0, ∞) ∪ {∞}), [0, ∞) := {x : x ∈ R, 0 ≤ x}, B ∈ Bf (G). In view of
                                                                ′
the existence of the intertwining operator V of T µ with T µ there exists an
isomorphism of Hilbert spaces τ : L2 (G, µ, C) → L2 (G, µ′ , C), which has a
continuous extension to an isomorphism of Banach spaces τ : L∞ (G, µ, C) →

                                    38
L∞ (G, µ′ , C) due to Condition (i). On the other hand, in view of Condition
(ii) there exists a sequence fn ∈ L2 (G, µ, C) ∩ L∞ (G, µ, C) such that 0 <
C1 an ≤ bn ≤ C2 an < ∞ for each n ∈ N and there exist limn→∞ cn < ∞ and
limn→∞ dn = ∞, where C1 and C2 are positive constants, an := kfn kL2 (G,µ,C) ,
bn := kτ fn kL2 (G,µ′ ,C) , cn := kfn kL∞ (G,µ,C) , dn := kτ fn kL∞ (G,µ′ ,C) , since there
are sequences {yn : 0 < yn < ∞, n ∈ N} such that n (yn )−2 < ∞, but
                                                                  P
           −1
   n (yn )    = ∞. This means that singularity of µ with µ′ leads to the con-
P

tradiction, consequently, µ and µ′ are equivalent.
     3.5. Note. It follows from [10, 44], that on K0 there is a family P of
orthogonal Gaussian measures of cardinality card(P ) = card(R) =: c, which
induce quasi-invariant measures on G relative to G′ and have continuous
quasi-invariance factor on G′ × G. Therefore, there are c non-equivalent
unitary representations T µ of G′ in L2 (G, µ, C) due to Theorems 3.3 and 3.4.
     3.6. Theorem. On the loop group G = (LM N)ξ and G = (LM                    R N)ξ from
§2.1.4 and §2.8 there exists a family of continuous characters {Ξ}, which
separate points of G.
     Proof. Since N is either finite-dimensional or the separable Hilbert man-
ifold, then N has a countable locally finite covering subordinated to the cov-
ering of N induced by the exponential mapping exp : T̃ N → N from a
neighbourhood T̃ N of N in T N such that expy : Vy → Wy are local dif-
feomorphisms of the corresponding neighbourhoods Vy and Wy of the zero
section in Ty N and of y ∈ N. Let λ be equivalent with a Gaussian proba-
bility σ-additive measure either on the entire Ty N or on its Hilbert subspace
P . Each such λ induces a family of probability measures ν on Bf (N) or its
cylinder subalgebra induced by the projection of Ty N onto P , which may
differ by their supports.
     Let Ty NR =: L be an infinite-dimensional separable Banach space over
R, so there exists a topolgical vector space LN := ∞             j=1 Lj , where Lj = L
                                                              Q
                                                      ∞
for each j ∈ N [41]. Consider a subspace Λ of a space of continuous ∞-
multilinear functionals w : LN → R such that w(x + y) = w(x) + w(y),
w(σx) = (−1)|σ| w(x), w(x) = λw(z) for each x, y ∈ LN , σ ∈ S∞ and λ ∈ R,
where x = {xj : xj ∈ L, j ∈ N} ∈ LN , z j = xj for each j 6= k0 and
λz k0 = xk0 , S∞ is a group of all bijections σ : N → N such that card{j :
σ(j) 6= j} < ℵ0 , |σ| = 1 for σ = σ1 ...σn with odd n ∈ N and pairwise
transpositions σl 6= I, that is σl (j1 ) = j2 , σl (j2 ) = j1 and σl |N\{j1 ,j2} = I for
the corresponding j1 6= j2 , |σ| = 2 for even n or σ = I. Then Λ∞ (or Λj )
induces a vector bundle Λ∞ NR (or Λj NR ) on a manifold NR of ∞-multilinear

                                            39
skew-symmetric mappings over F(NR ) of Ψ(NR )∞ (or Ψ(NR )j respectively)
into F(NR ), where Ψ(NR ) is a set of differentiable vector fields on NR and
F(NR ) is an algebra of real-valued C 1 -functions on NR (see also [23, 24]).
This Λ∞ NR is the vector bundle of differential ∞-forms on NR . Then there
exist a subfamily Λ∞   G NR of differential forms w on N induced by the family
{ν}.
    Let B̄ ∞ N := ( 0≤j∈Z Λj NR ) ⊕ Λ∞    G NR for dimR NR = ∞ and B̄ N =
                                                                           k
                      L
Lk      j                                        k
   j=0 Λ NR for each k ∈ N. We choose w ∈ B̄ N, where k = min(dimR NR , dimR MR ).
There exists its pull back f w for each f ∈ Y ξ (M, N) (see [23] and §2.11).
                               ∗

Let Ej : Sj → P be a family of continuous linear operators from Banach
spaces Sj into a Banach space P , then there exists a continuous linear oper-
ator E : l2,d′ ({Sj : j ∈ N}) → P such that Ex = ∞             j              j
                                                       j=1 Ej x , where x = {x :
                                                     P

xj ∈ Sj , j ∈ N} ∈ l2,d′ ({Sj : j ∈ N}), 0 < d′ < ∞. If f ∈ Y ξ (M, N), then
it induces the pull back operator f ∗ w for each w ∈ B̄ k Ñ. Therefore, there
exists a pull back f ∗ w for ν and w either on N s or on Ñ instead of N in the
corresponding cases of dimC M and dimC N (see §2.11).
    Moreover,    to f ∗ w a measure µw,f on M corresponds. Then Fw (f ) :=
     ∗                  ∗                 ξ                             ∞
 M f w = M (f ◦ ψ) w for each f ∈ Y (M, s0 ; N, y0 ) and ψ ∈ Dif fs0 (MR ) ∩
R           R
  ξ
Z (MR , MR ) due to §26 [44] and [1]. Therefeore, Fw is continuous and con-
stant on each class < f >ξ due to §2.9 and §2.11. If f ∗ w = 0 for each w as
above, then Df = 0. In view of f (s0 ) = y0 this implies that f (M) = {y0 }.
Hence for each < f >ξ 6= e there exists w such that Fw (f ) 6= 0.
    Let Ξ̃ : C → S 1 be a continuous character of C (or Ξ̃ : R → S1 respec-
tively) as the additive group (see [20]). Therefore, Ξ(g) := Ξ̃(Fw (f )) is a
continuous character on G for each g :=< f >ξ ∈ G.
