                                                     Abstract. Howe’s duality is considered from a unifying point of view based on Lie su-
                                                     peralgebras. New examples are offered. In particualr, we construct several simplest spinor-
                                                     oscillator representations and compute their highest weights for the “stringy” Lie superalge-
                                                     bras (i.e., Lie superalgebras of complex vector fields (or their nontrivial central extensions)
                                                     on the supercircle S 1|n and its two-sheeted cover associated with the Möbius bundle).


                                               In our two lectures we briefly review, on the most elementary level, several results and
                                             problems unified by “Howe’s duality”. Details will be given elsewhere. The ground field in
                                             the lectures is C.

                                                                                        §1. Introduction
                                                In his famous preprint [24] R. Howe gave an inspiring explanation of what can be “dug
                                             out” from H. Weyl’s “wonderful and terrible” book [55], at least as far as invariant theory
                                             is concerned, from a certain unifying viewpoint. According to Howe, much is based on a
                                             remarkable correspondence between certain irreducible representations of Lie subalgebras Γ
                                             and Γ′ of the Lie algebra o(V ) or sp(V ) provided Γ and Γ′ are each other’s “commutants”, i.e.,
                                             centralizers. This correspondence is known ever since as Howe’s correspondence or Howe’s
                                             duality. In [24] and subsequent papers Howe gave several examples of such a correspondence
                                             previously known, mostly, inadvertently. Let us remind some of them (omitting important
                                             Jacquet-Langlands-Shimizu correspondence, S. Gelbart’s contributions, etc.) :
                                                                                      .
                                                1) decomposition of o(V )-module S (V ) into spherical harmonics;
                                                                                                .
                                                2) Lefschetz decomposition of sp(V )-module Λ (V ) into primitive forms (sometimes this is
                                             called Hodge–Lépage decomposition);
                                                3) a striking resemblance between spinor representation of o(n) and oscillator (Shale–
                                             Segal–Weil–metaplectic–... ) representation of sp(2n).
                                                As an aside Howe gives the “shortest possible” proof of the Poincaré lemma. (Recall that
                                             this lemma states that in any sufficiently small open star-shaped neighborhood of any point
                                             on any manifold any closed differential form is exact.) In this proof, Lie superalgebras, that
                                             lingered somewhere in the background in the previous discussion but were treated rather
                                             as a nuisance than help, are instrumental to reach the goal. This example shows also that
                                             the requirement of reductivity of Γ and Γ′ to form a “dual pair” is extra. Elsewhere we
                                             will investigate what are the actual minimal restrictions on Γ and Γ′ needed to reach one
                                             of the other problems usually solved by means of Howe duality: decompose the symmetric
                                             or exterior algebra of a module over Γ ⊕ Γ′ . Howe’s manuscript was written at the time
                                             when supersymmetry theory was being conceived. By the time [24] was typed, the definition
                                             of what is nowadays called superschemes ([34]) was not yet rewritten in terms to match

physical papers (language of points was needed; now we can recommend [5]) nor translated
into English and, therefore, was unknown; the classification of simple finite dimensional Lie
superalgebras over C had just been announced. This was, perhaps, the reason for a cautious
tone with which Howe used Lie superalgebras, although he made transparent how important
they might be for a lucid presentation of his ideas and explicitly stated so.
   Since [25], the published version of [24], though put aside to stew for 12 years, underwent
only censorial changes, we believe it is of interest to explore what do we gain by using Lie
superalgebras from the very beginning (an elaboration of other aspects of this idea [4] are not
published yet). Here we briefly elucidate some of Howe’s results and notions and give several
new examples of Howe’s dual pairs. In the lectures we will review the known examples 1) –
3) mentioned above but consider them in an appropriate “super” setting, and add to them:
   4) a refinement of the Lefschetz decomposition — J. Bernstein’s decomposition ([2]) of the
         .
space Ω~ of “twisted” differential forms on a symplectic manifold with values in a line bundle
with connection whose curvature form differs by a factor ~ from the canonical symplectic
form;
   5) a decomposition of the space of differential forms on a hyper-Kählerian manifold sim-
ilar to the Lefschetz one ([53]) but with sp(4) instead of sp(2) = sl(2) and its refinement
associated with the osp(1|4).
   6) Apart from general clarification of the scenery and new examples even in the old setting,
i.e., on manifolds, the superalgebras introduced ab ovo make it manifest that there are at
least two types of Howe’s correspondence: the conventional one and several “ghost” ones
associated with quantization of the antibracket [40].
   7) Obviously, if Γ ⊕ Γ′ is a maximal subalgebra of osp, then (Γ, Γ′) is an example of Howe
dual pair. Section 6 gives some further examples, partly borrowed from [48], where more
examples can be found.
   We consider here only finite dimensional Lie superalgebras with the invariant theory in
view. In another lecture (§§3,4) we consider spinor-oscillator representations in more detail.
In these elementary talks we do not touch other interesting applications such as Capelli iden-
tities ([30],[43]), or prime characteristic ([47]). Of dozens of papers with examples of Howe’s
duality in infinite dimensional cases and still other examples, we draw attention of the reader
to the following selected ones: [12], and various instances of bose-fermi correspondence, cf.
[13] and [26]. Observe also that the Howe duality often manifests itself for q-deformed alge-
bras, e.g., in Klimyk’s talk at our conference, or [6]. To treat this q-Howe duality in a similar
way, we first have to explicitly q-quantize Poisson superalgebras po(2n|m) (for mn = 0 this
is straightforward replacement of (super)commutators from [39] with q-(super)commutators.

                           {f, g}P.b. =        ∂pi ∂qi

Sometimes it is more convenient to redenote the Θ’s and set

and accordingly modify the bracket (if m = 2r, there is no term with θ):

Setting degLie f = deg f − 2 for any monomial f ∈ C[p, q, Θ], where deg pi = deg qi =
deg Θj = 1 for all i, j, we obtain the standard Z-grading of g:
   degree of f −2        −1          0             1        ...
         f        1 p, q, θ f : deg f = 2 f : deg f = 3 . . .
Clearly, g = ⊕ gi with g0 ≃ osp(m|2n). Consider now another, “rough”, grading of g. To
             i≥−2
this end, introduce: Q = (q, ξ), P = (p, η) and set
                                                      
                                                          1 if m = 2k
                    deg Qi = 0, deg θ = 1, deg Pi =                                         (∗)
                                                          2 if m = 2k + 1.
Remark. Physicists prefer to use half-integer values of deg for m = 2k + 1 by setting
deg θ = 21 and deg Pi = 1 at all times.
   The above grading (∗) of the polynomial algebra induces the following rough grading of
the Lie superalgebra g. For m = 2k just delete the columns of odd degrees and delete the
degrees by 2:
                degree . . .       2        1       0         −1    −2
m = 2k + 1:                           2
               elements . . . C[Q]P C[Q]P θ C[Q]P C[Q]θ C[Q]
   2.2. Quantization. We call the nontrivial deformation Q of the Lie superalgebra
po(2n|m) quantization (for details see [40]). There are many ways to quantize g, but all
of them are equivalent. Recall that we only consider g whose elements are represented
by polynomials; for functions of other types (say, Laurent polynomials) the uniqueness of
quantization may be violated.
   Consider the following quantization, so-called QP -quantization, given on linear terms by
the formulas:
                                                         ∂
                                   Q : Q 7→ Q̂, P 7→ ~      ,                              (∗)
                                                        ∂Q
where Q̂ is the operator of left multiplication by Q; an arbitrary monomial should be first
rearranged so that the Q’s stand first (normal form) and then apply (∗) term-wise.
   The deformed Lie superalgebra Q(po(2n|2k)) is the Lie superalgebra of differential oper-
ators with polynomial coefficients on Rn|k . Actually, it is an analog of gl(V ). This is most
clearly seen for n = 0. Indeed,
                                               .
                          Q(po(0|2k)) = gl(Λ (ξ)) = gl(2k−1|2k−1 ).
In general, for n 6= 0, we have
                          Q(po(2n|2k)) = “gl”(F (Q)) = diff(Rn|k ).
For m = 2k − 1 we consider po(0|2k − 1) as a subalgebra of po(0|2k); the quantization sends
po(0|2k − 1) into q(2k−1 ). For n 6= 0 the image of Q is an infinite dimensional analog of q,
                      ∂
indeed (for J = i(θ + ∂θ ) with i2 = −1):
               Q(po(2n|2k − 1)) = qdiff(Rn|k ) = {D ∈ diff(Rn|k ) : [d, J] = 0}.
   2.3. Fock spaces and spinor-oscillator representations. The Lie superalgebras
diff(Rn|k ) and qdiff(Rn|k ) have indescribably many irreducible representations even for n = 0.
But one of the representations, the identity one, in the superspace of functions on Rn|k , is
4                          DIMITRY LEITES1 , IRINA SHCHEPOCHKINA2

the “smallest” one. Moreover, if we consider the superspace of diff(Rn|k ) or qdiff(Rn|k ) as the
associative superalgebra (denoted Diff(Rn|k ) or QDiff(Rn|k )), this associative superalgebra
has only one irreducible representation — the same identity one. This representation is
called the Fock space.
  As is known, the Lie superalgebras osp(m|2n) are rigid for (m|2n) 6= (4|2). Therefore, the
through map
                                                                Q
                    h −→ g0 = osp(m|2n) ⊂ g = po(2n|m) −→ diff(Rn|k )

sends any subsuperalgebra h of osp(m|2n) (for (m|2n) 6= (4|2)) into its isomorphic image.
(One can also embed h into diff(Rn|k ) directly.) The irreducible subspace of the Fock space
which contains the constants is called the spinor-oscillator representation of h. In particular
cases, for m = 0 or n = 0 this subspace turns into the usual spinor or oscillator represen-
tation, respectively. We have just given a unified description of them. (A more detailed
description follows.)
   2.4. Primitive alias harmonic elements. The elements of osp(m|2n) (or its subalgebra
h) act in the space of the spinor-oscillator representation by inhomogeneous differential
operators of order ≤ 2 (order is just the filtration associated with the “rough” grading):
     m = 2k:                         m = 2k + 1:
      degree −1 0              1       degree    −2 −1 0          1     2
                   2             2
    elements P̂ P̂ Q̂ Q̂              elements   P̂ P̂ θ̂ P̂ Q̂ Q̂θ̂ Q̂2
                                                    2
                                   2
   The elements from (C[Q])P̂ for m = 2k or (C[Q, θ])P̂ θ̂ for m = 2k+1 are called primitive or
harmonic ones. More generally, let h ⊂ osp(m|2n) be a Z-graded Lie superalgebra embedded
consistently with the rough grading of osp(m|2n). Then the elements from (C[Q])h−1 for
m = 2k or (C[Q, θ])h−1 for m = 2k + 1 will be called h-primitive or h-harmonic.
   2.4.1. Nonstandard Z-gradings of osp(m|2n). It is well known that one simple
Lie superalgebra can have several nonequivalent Cartan matrices and systems of Chevalley
generators, cf. [20]. Accordingly, the corresponding divisions into positive and negative root
vectors are distinct. The following problem arises: How the passage to nonstandard gradings
affects the highest weight of the spinor-oscillator representation defined in sec. 3? (Cf. [44])
   2.5. Examples of dual pairs. Two subalgebras Γ, Γ′ of g0 = osp(m|2n) will be called
a dual pair if one of them is the centralizer of the other in g0 .
   If Γ ⊕ Γ′ is a maximal subalgebra in g0 , then, clearly, Γ, Γ′ is a dual pair. A generalization:
consider a pair of mutual centralizers Γ, Γ′ in gl(V ) and embed gl(V ) into osp(V ⊕V ∗ ). Then
Γ, Γ′ is a dual pair (in osp(V ⊕ V ∗ )). For a number of such examples see [49]. Let us consider
several of these examples in detail.
   2.5.1. Γ = sp(2n) = sp(W ) and Γ′ = sp(2) = sl(2) = sp(V ⊕ V ∗ ). Clearly, h = Γ ⊕ Γ′ is
                                                                             .
a maximal subalgebra in o(W ⊗ (V ⊕ V ∗ )). The Fock space is just Λ (W ).
   The following classical theorem and its analog 5.2 illustrate the importance of the above
notions and constructions.
                                                   .
   Theorem. The Γ′ -primitive elements of Λ (W ) of each degree i constitute an irreducible
              i
Γ-module Psp    , 0 ≤ i ≤ n.
   This action of Γ′ in the superspace of differential forms on any symplectic manifold is
well known: Γ′ is generated (as a Lie algebra) by operators X+ of left multiplication by the
symplectic form ω and X− , application of the bivector dual to ω.
   2.5.2. Γ = o(2n) = o(W ) and Γ′ = sp(2) = sl(2) = sp(V ⊕ V ∗ ). Clearly, h = Γ ⊕ Γ′ is a
                                                                           .
maximal subalgebra in sp(W ⊗ (V ⊕ V ∗ )). The Fock space is just S (W ).
                                                   .
   Theorem. The Γ′ -primitive elements of S (W ) of each degree i constitute an irreducible
Γ-module Poi , i = 0, 1, . . . .

   This action of Γ′ in the space of polynomial functions on any Riemann manifold is also
well known: Γ′ is generated (as a Lie algebra) by operators X+ of left multiplication by
the quadratic polynomial representing the metric g and X− is the corresponding Laplace
operator.
   Clearly, a mixture of Examples 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 corresponding to symmetric or skew-
symmetric forms on a supermanifold is also possible: the space of Γ′ -primitive elements
     .
of S (W ) of each degree i is an irreducible Γ-module, cf. [44] and Sergeev’s papers [51], [52].
   In [24], [25] the dual pairs had to satisfy one more condition: the through action of both
Γ and Γ′ on the identity g0 -module should be completely reducible. Even for the needs of
the First Theorem of Invariant Theory this is too strong a requirement, cf. examples with
complete irreducibility in [51, 52] with our last example, in which the complete reducibility of
pe(n) is violated. Investigation of the requiremets on Γ and Γ′ needed for the First Theorem
of Invariant Theory will be given elsewhere.
   2.5.3. Bernstein’s square root of the Lefschetz decomposition. Let L be the space
of a (complex) line bundle over a connected symplectic manifold (M 2n , ω) with connection
∇ such that the curvature form of ∇ is equal to ~ω for some ~ ∈ C. This ~ will be called a
twist; the space of tensor fields of type ρ (here ρ : sp(2n) −→ gl(U) is a representation which
defines the space Γ(M, U) of tensor fields with values in U), and twist ~ will be denoted
by T~(ρ). Let us naturally extend the action of X+ , X− from the space Ω of differential
forms on M onto the space Ω~ of twisted differential forms using the isomorphism of spaces
T~(ρ) ≃ T (ρ) ⊗ Γ(L), where Γ(L) = Ω0~ is the space of sections of the line bundle L, i.e., the
space of twisted functions.
   Namely, set X+ 7→ X+ ⊗ 1, etc. Let D+ = d + α be the connection ∇ itself and D− =
[X− , D+ ]. On Ω~, introduce a superspace structure setting p(ϕ ⊗ s) = deg ϕ (mod 2), for
ϕ ∈ Ω, s ∈ Ω0~.
   Theorem. ([2]) On Ω~, the operators D+ and D− generate an action of the Lie superal-
gebra osp(1|2) commuting with the action of the group Ĝ of ∇-preserving automorphisms of
the bundle L.
   Bernstein studied the Ĝ-action, more exactly, the action of the Lie algebra po(2n|0) corre-
sponding to Ĝ; we are interested in the part of this action only: in sp(2n) = po(2n|0)0 -action.
   In Example 2.5.1 the space P i consisted of differential forms with constant coefficients.
                          .
Denote by P i = P i ⊗ S (V ) the space of primitive forms with polynomial coefficients. The
                        √ i
elements of the space P ~ = ker D− ∩ P~i will be called ∇-primitive forms of degree i (and
twist ~).
                            √ i
   Bernstein showed that P ~ is an irreducible g = po(2n|0)-module. It could be that over
                             √ i
subalgebra g0 the module P ~ becomes reducible but the general theorem of Howe (which
is true for osp(1|2n)) states that this is not the case, it remains irreducible. Shapovalov
and Shmelev literally generalized Bernstein’s result for (2n|m)-dimensional supermanifolds,
see review [37]. In particular, Shapovalov, who considered n = 0, “took a square root of
Laplacian and the metric”.
   2.5.4. Inspired by Bernstein’s construction, let us similarly define a “square root” of the
hyper-Kähler structure. Namely, on a hyper-Kählerean manifold (M, ω1 , ω2 ) consider a line
bundle L with two connections: ∇1 and ∇2 , whose curvature forms are equal to ~1 ω1 and
~2 ω2 for some ~1 , ~2 ∈ C. The pair ~ = (~1 , ~2 ) will be called a twist; the space of tensor
fields of type ρ and twist ~ will be denoted by T~(ρ). Verbitsky [53] defined the action of
sp(4) in the space Ω of differential forms on M. Let us naturally extend the action of the
generators Xj± for j = 1, 2 of of sp(4) from Ω onto the space Ω~ of twisted differential forms
using the isomorphism T~(ρ) ≃ T (ρ) ⊗ Γ(L), where Γ(L) = Ω0~ is the space of sections of the
6                         DIMITRY LEITES1 , IRINA SHCHEPOCHKINA2

line bundle L; here Xj+ is the operator of multiplication by ωj and Xj− is the operator of
convolution with the dual bivector.
   Define the space of primitive i-forms (with constant coefficients) on the hyper-Kählerean
manifold (M, ω1 , ω2 ) by setting
                                 P i = ker X1− ∩ ker X2− ∩ Ωi .                          (HK)
According to the general theorem [25] this space is an irreducible sp(2n; H)-module.
  Set Di− = [Xi− , Di+ ]. The promised square root of the decomposition (HK) is the space
                                                                                      √
                                 P~i = ker D1− ∩ ker D2− ∩ Ωi~.                      ( HK)
The operators Di± , where Di+ = ∇i , generate osp(1|4).
  2.6. Further examples of dual pairs. The following subalgebras g1 (V1 ) ⊕ g2 (V2 ) are
maximal in g(V1 ⊗ V2 ), hence, are dual pairs:
                   g1            g2                          g
              osp(n1 |2m1 ) osp(n2 |2m2 ) osp(n1 n2 + 4m1 m2 |2n1 m2 + 2n2 m1 )
                  o(n)      osp(n2 |2m2 )       osp(nn2 |2nm2 ), n 6= 2, 4
                 sp(2n)     osp(n2 |2m2 )           osp(2mn2 |4nm2 )
                 pe(n1 )       pe(n2 )        osp(2n1 n2 |2n1 n2 ), n1 , n2 > 2
              osp(n1 |2m1 )    pe(n2 )       pe(n1 n2 + 2m1 n2 ) if n1 6= 2m1
                                            spe(n1 n2 + 2m1 n2 ) if n1 = 2m1
                  o(n)         pe(m)                      pe(nm)
                 sp(2n)        pe(m)                    pe(2nm)
In particular, on the superspace of polyvector fields, there is a natural pe(n)-module struc-
ture, and pe(1), its dual partner in osp(2n|2n), is spanned by the divergence operator ∆ (“odd
Laplacian”), called the BRST operator ([1]), the even operator of pe(1) being degx − degθ ,
where θi = π( ∂x∂ i ), π being the shift of parity operator.
   For further examples of maximal subalgebras in gl and q see [49]. These subalgebras
give rise to other new examples of Howe dual pairs. For the decomposition of the tensor
algebra corresponding to some of these examples see [51, 52], some of the latter are further
elucidated in [3]. Some further examples of Howe’s duality, considered in a detailed version
of our lectures, are: (1) over reals; (2) dual pairs in simple subalgebras of po(2n|m) distinct
from osp(m|2n); in particular, (3) embeddings into po(2n|m; r), the nonstandard regradings
of the Poisson superalgebra, cf. [50]; (4) a “projective” version of the Howe duality associated
with embeddings into the Lie superalgebra of Hamiltonian vector fields, the quotient of the
Poisson superalgebra, in particular, the exceptional cases in dimension (2|2), cf. [40]. It is
also interesting to consider the prime characteristic and an “odd” Howe’s duality obtained
from quantization of the antibracket (the main objective of [4]), to say nothing of q-quantized
versions of the above.

          §3. Generalities on spinor and spinor-like representations
   3.1. The spinor and oscillator representations of Lie algebras. The importance
of the spinor representation became clear very early. One of the reasons is the following.
As is known from any textbook on representation theory, the fundamental representations
R(ϕ1 ) = W , R(ϕ2 ) = Λ2 (W ), . . . , R(ϕn−1 ) = Λn−1 (W ) of sl(W ), where dim W = n and
ϕi is the highest weight of Λi (W ), are irreducible. Any finite dimensional
                                                                   P          irreducible sl(n)-
          λ
module L is completely determined by its highest weight λ =          λi ϕi with λi ∈ Z+ . The
module Lλ can be realized as a submodule (or quotient) of ⊗ R(ϕi )⊗λi .
                         THE HOWE DUALITY AND LIE SUPERALGEBRAS                                     7

   Similarly, every irreducible gl(n)-module Lλ , where λ = (λ1 , . . . λn−1 ; c) and c is the eigen-
value of the unit matrix, is realized in the space of tensors, perhaps, twisted with the help
                                              ⊗λi
of c-densities, namely in the space ⊗ R(ϕi )       ⊗ tr , where trc is the Lie algebraic version
                                                       c
                                       i
of the cth power of the determinant, i.e., infinitesimally, trace, given for any c ∈ C by the
formula X 7→ c·tr(X) for any matrix X ∈ gl(W ). Thus, all the irreducible finite dimensional
representations of sl(W ) are naturally realized in the space of tensors, i.e., in the subspaces
or quotient spaces of the space Tqp = W| ⊗ ·{z· · ⊗ W} |⊗W ∗ ⊗{z
                                                               · · · ⊗ W }∗ , where W is the space
                                                p                q
of the identity representation. For gl(W ), we have to consider the space Tqp ⊗ trc .
   For sp(W ), the construction is similar, except the fundamental module R(ϕi ) is now a
part of the module Λi (id) consisting of the primitive forms.
   For o(W ), the situation is totally different: not all fundamental representations can be
realised as (parts of) the modules Λi (id). The exceptional one (or two, for o(2n)) of them is
called the spinor representation; for o(W ), where dim W = 2n, it is realized in the Grassmann
           .
algebra E (V ) of a “half” of W , where W = V ⊕ V ∗ is a decomposition into the direct sum
of subspaces isotropic with respect to the form preserved by o(W ). For dim W = 2n + 1, it
                                          .
is realized in the Grassmann algebra E (V ⊕ W0 ), where W = V ⊕ V ∗ ⊕ W0 and W0 is the
1-dimensional space on which the orthogonal form is nondegenerate.
   The quantization of the harmonic oscillator leads to an infinite dimensional analog of
the spinor representation which after Howe we call oscillator representation of sp(W ). It is
              .
realized in S (V ), where as above, V is a maximal isotropic subspace of W (with respect
to the skew form preserved by sp(W )). The remarkable likeness of the spinor and oscillator
representations was underlined in a theory of dual Howe’s pairs, [23].
   The importance of spinor-oscillator representations is different for distinct classes of Lie
algebras and their representations. In the description of irreducible finite dimensional repre-
sentations of classical matrix Lie algebras gl(n), sl(n) and sp(2n) we can do without either
spinor or oscillator representations. We can not do without spinor representation for o(n),
but a pessimist might say that spinor representation constitutes only n1 th of the building
bricks. Our, optimistic, point of view identifies the spinor representations as one of the two
possible types of the building bricks.
   For the Witt algebra witt and its central extension, the Virasoro algebra vir, every irre-
ducible highest weight module is realized as a quotient of a spinor or, equivalently, oscillator
representation, see [8], [10]. This miraculous equivalence is known in physics under the name
of bose-fermi correspondence, see [18], [26].
   For the list of generalizations of witt and vir, i.e., simple (or close to simple) stringy
Lie superalgebras or Lie superalgebras of vector fields on N-extended supercircles, often
called by an unfortunate (as explained in [21]) name “superconformal algebras”, see [21].
The importance of spinor-oscillator representations diminishes as N grows, but for the most
interesting — distinguished ([21]) — stringy superalgebras it is high, cf. [11], [46].
   3.2. Semi-infinite cohomology. An example of applications of spinor-oscillator rep-
resentations: semi-infinite (or BRST) cohomology of Lie superalgebras. These cohomology
were introduced by Feigin first for Lie algebras ([9]); then he extended the definition to Lie
superalgebras via another construction, equivalent to the first one for Lie algebras ([7]). For
an elucidation of Feigin’s construction see [14], [31] and [54]. Feigin rewrote in mathematical
terms and generalized the constructions physicists used to determine the critical dimensions
of string theories, i.e., the dimensions in which the quantization of the superstring is pos-
sible, see [42], [18]. These critical dimensions are the values of the central element (central
charges) on the spinor-oscillator representation constructed from the adjoint representation;
8                            DIMITRY LEITES1 , IRINA SHCHEPOCHKINA2

to this day not for every central element of all distinguished simple stringy superalgebras
their values are computed on every spinor-oscillator representation, not even on the ones
constructed from the adjoint representations.

       §4. The spinor-oscillator representations and Lie superalgebras
  4.1. Spinor (Clifford–Weil–wedge– . . . ) and oscillator representations. As we
saw in [40], po(2n|m)0 ∼
                       = osp(m|2n), the superspace of elements of degree 0 in the standard
Z-grading of po(2n|m) or, which is the same, the superspace of quadratic elements in the
representation by generating functions. At our first lecture we defined the spinor-oscillator
representation as the through map (here k = [ m2 ] and Q is the quantization)
                                        
                                    Q     diff(n|k) if m = 2k
                    g −→ po(2n|m) −→
                                          qdiff(n|k) if m = 2k − 1,
where Im(g) ⊂ po(2n|m)0 = osp(m|2n). Actually, such requirement is too restrictive, we
only need that the image of g under embedding into po(2n|m) remains rigid under quanti-
zation. So various simple subalgebras of po(2n|m) will do as ambients of g.
   This spinor-oscillator representation is called the spinor representation of g if n = 0, or
the oscillator representation if m = 0. We will denote this representation Spin(V ) and set
Osc(V ) = Spin(Π(V )), where V is the standard representation of osp(m|2n). In other words,
if Spin(V ) is a representation of osp(m|2n), then Osc(V ) is a representation of osp(2n|m),
so Osc(V ) only exists for m even.
   If V is a g-module without any bilinear form, but we still want to construct a spinor-
oscillator representation of g, consider the module W = V ⊕ V ∗ (where in the infinite
dimensional case we replace V ∗ with the restricted dual of V ; roughly speaking, if V = C[x],
                 ∂                                       ∂
then V ∗ = C[[ ∂x  ]], whereas the restricted dual is C[ ∂x ]) endowed with the form (for v1 , w1 ∈
               ∗
V , v2 , w2 ∈ V ) symmetric for the plus sign and skew-symmetric otherwise:
                      B((v1 , v2 ), (w1 , w2)) = v2 (w1 ) ± (−1)p(v1 )p(w2 ) w2 (v1 ).
Now, in W , select a maximal isotropic subspace U (not necessarily V or V ∗ ) and realize the
spinor-oscillator representation of g in the exterior algebra of U.
   Observe that the classical descriptions of spinor representations differ from ours, see, e.g.,
[17], where the embedding of g (in their case g = o(n)) into the quantized algebra (namely
into Q(po(0|n − 1))) is considered, not into po(0|m). The existence of this embedding is not
so easy to see unless told, whereas our constructions are manifest and bring about the same
result.
   To illustrate our definitions and constructions, we realize the orthogonal Lie algebra o(n)
as the subalgebra in the Lie superalgebra po(0|n).
   Case o(2k). Basis:
             X1+ = ξ2 η1 ,        ...,        +
                                             Xk−1 = ξk ηk−1 ,                Xk+ = ηk ηk−1 ;

                                             Xk−1 = ξk−1ηk ,                 Xk− = ξk−1 ξk ;
          H1 = ξ1 η1 − ξ2 η2 , . . . , Hk−1 = ξk−1ηk−1 − ξk ηk , Hk = ξk−1ηk−1 + ξk ηk .
For R(ϕk ) take the subspacespace functions C[ξ]ev which contains the constants C · 1̂, where
1̂ is just the constant function 1; clearly, 1̂ is the vacuum vector.
    Quantization (see above) sends: ξi into ξˆi , and ηi into ~ ∂ξ∂ i , so Xi± 1̂ = 0 for i < k, hence,
Hi 1̂ = [Xi+ , Xi− ]1̂ = 0 for i < k. Contrariwise,
               Hk 1̂ = [X + , X − ]1̂ = [∂k ∂k−1 , ξˆk−1ξˆk ]1̂ = ∂k (−ξˆk−1∂k−1 + 1)ξˆk 1̂ = 1̂.

So we see that the spinor representation is indeed a fundamental one.

               H1 = ξ1 η1 − ξ2 η2 , . . . , Hk−1 = ξk−1ηk−1 − ξk ηk ,   Hk = 2ξk ηk .
For R(ϕk ) consider the space of even functions C[ξ1 , . . . , ξk , θ]ev and realize o(2k + 1) so that
ξi 7→ ξˆi , ηi 7→ ~ ∂ξ∂ i , θ 7→ ~(θ̂ + ∂θ

So 1̂ is indeed the highest weight vector of the kth fundamental representation.
  4.2. Stringy superalgebras. Case vir. For the basis of vir take ei = ti+1 dtd , i ∈ Z, and
the central element z; let the bracket be

We advise the reader to refresh definitions of stringy superalgebras and various modules
over them, see [21], where we also try to convince physicists not to use the term “super-
conformal algebra” (except, perhaps, for kL (1|1) and kM (1|1)). In particular, recall that
Fλ,µ = Span(ϕi = tµ+i (dt)λ | i ∈ Z).
  Statement. The only instances when Fλ,µ possesses       √ an invariant symmetric nondegen-
erate bilinear form are the space of half-densities, Vol = F1/2,0 , and its twisted version,
F1/2,1/2 and in both cases the form is:
                                        √      √       Z
                                     (f dt, g dt) = f g · dt;

the only instances when Fλ,µ possesses an invariant skew-symmetric forms are√the quotient
space of functions modulo constants, dF = F0,0 /C · 1, and 12 -twisted functions, tF = F0,1/2
and in both cases the form is:               Z
                                           (f, g) =   f · dg.

  Let ∂i = ∂ϕ i
                (where  ϕ i = t    (dt)   ). Let osc(   Vol) be the vir-submodule of the exterior
algebra on ϕi for i < 0 containing the constant 1̂. Since the generators ei of vir acts on Fλ,µ
as (sums over i ∈ Z)
                                P                          P

and representing e0 and z as brackets
                                  √     of e±1 and e±2 from (∗) we immediately deduce that
the highest weights (c, h) of osc( Vol) is (− 13 , 0).
                                       √
   For the spinor representations spin( tF ) and spin(dF ) (realized on the symmetric algebra √
of ϕi for i < 0) we similarly obtain that the highest weights (c, h) are ( 16 , 12 ) for spin( tF )
and (− 16 , 0) for spin(dF ).

    Observe that the representations spin( tF ), spin(dF ) and osc( Vol) are constructed on
a half of the generators used to construct Spin(Fλ;µ ).
    4.3. The highest weights of the spinor representations of kL (1|n) and kM (1|n). In
the following theorem we give the coordinates (c, h; H1 , . . . ) of the highest weight of the spinor
representations Spin(Fλ;µ ) of the contact superalgebra kL (1|n) with respect to z (the central
element), Kt , and, after semicolon, on the elements of Cartan subalgebra, respectively. For
kM (1|n) we write h̃; H̃i . (Observe that for n > 4 the Cartan subalgebra has more generators
than just H1 = Kξ1 η1 , . . . , Hk = Kξk ηk which generate the Cartan subalgebra of k(1|2k), the
algebra of contact vector fields with polynomial coefficients.)

    Theorem. Let (c, h; H1 , . . . ) be the highest weight of the spinor representation Spin(Fλ;µ )
of kL (1|n). The highest weight of the oscillator representation Osc(Fλ;µ ) = Spin(Π(Fλ;µ )) is
(−c, h; H1 , . . . ) and similarly for kM (1|n).
    For n 6= 2, all the coordinates of the highest weight other than c, h vanish. For n = 2 the
value of H on the highest weight vector from Spin(Fλ,ν;µ) is equal to ν.
    The values of c and h (or h̃) on modules Spin(Fλ;µ ) are given in the above table.
Up to rescaling, these results are known for small n, see [29], [28] and refs. therein.
    Remark. For the contact superalgebras g on the 1|n-dimensional supercircle our choice
of g-modules V = Fλ;µ from which we constructed Spin(V ⊕ V ∗ ) is natural for small n:
there are no other modules! For larger n it is only justified if we are interested in semi-
infinite cohomology of g and not in representation theory per se. For the superalgebras g of
series vect and svect the adjoint module g is of the form T (id∗ ), i.e, it is either coinduced
from multidimensional representation (vect), or is a submodule of such a coinduced module
(svect). Spinor-oscillator representations of this type were not studied yet, cf. sec. 5.
    4.4. Other spinor representations. 1) Among various Lie superalgebras for which it is
interesting to study spinor-oscillator representations, the simple (or close to them) maximal
subsuperalgebras of po are most interesting. The list of such maximal subalgebras is being
completed; various maximal subalgebras listed in [48] distinct from the sums of mutual
centralizers also provide with spinor representations.
    As an interesting example consider A. Sergeev’s Lie superalgebra as, the nontrivial central
extension of the Lie superalgebra spe(4) preserving the odd bilinear form and the volume on
the (4|4)-dimensional superspace, see [49, 50]. Namely, consider po(0|6), the Lie superalgebra
whose superspace is the Grassmann superalgebra Λ(ξ, η) generated by ξ1 , ξ2, ξ3 , η1 , η2 , η3 and
the bracket is the Poisson bracket. Recall also that the quotient of po(0|6) modulo center is
h(0|6) = Span(Hf | f ∈ Λ(ξ, η)), where
                                                X ∂f ∂      ∂f ∂
                               Hf = (−1)p(f )    (        +        ).
                                                   ∂ξj ∂ηj ∂ηj ∂ξj

Now, observe that spe(4) can be embedded into h(0|6). Indeed, setting deg ξi = deg ηi = 1
for all i we introduce a Z-grading on Λ(ξ, η) which, in turn, induces a Z-grading on h(0|6)
of the form h(0|6) = ⊕ h(0|6)i . Since sl(4) ∼
                                             = o(6), we can identify spe(4)0 with h(0|6)0 .
                       i≥−1
  It is not difficult to see that the elements of degree −1 in the standard gradings of spe(4)
and h(0|6) constitute isomorphic sl(4) ∼  = o(6)-modules. It is subject to a direct verification
that it is really possible to embed spe(4)1 into h(0|6)1.

   A. Sergeev’s extension as is the result of the restriction onto spe(4) ⊂ h(0|6) of the cocycle
that turns h(0|6) into po(0|6). The quantization (with parameter λ) deforms po(0|6) into
gl(Λ(ξ)); the through maps Tλ : as −→ po(0|6) −→ gl(Λ(ξ)) are representations of as in the
4|4-dimensional modules Spinλ . The explicit form of Tλ is as follows:
                                                             
                           a b                       a b − λc̃
                    Tλ :               + d · z 7→                 + λd · 14|4 ,
                           c −at                     c −at
where 14|4 is the unit matrix and ˜ is extended via linearity from matrices cij = Eij − Eji
on which c̃ij = ckl for any even permutation (1234) 7→ (ijkl). Clearly, Tλ is an irreducible
representation for any λ and Tλ 6≃ Tµ for λ 6= µ.
   2) Maximal subalgebras (for further examples see [48]) and a conjecture. Let V1 be a
linear superspace of dimension (r|s); let Λ(n) be the Grassmann superalgebra with n odd
generators ξ1 , . . . , ξn and vect(0|n) = derΛ(n) the Lie superalgebra of vector fields on the
(0|n)-dimensional supermanifold.
   Let g = gl(V1 ) ⊗ Λ(n) ⊂  + vect(0|n) be the semidirect sum (the ideal at the closed part of
⊂
+ ) with the natural action of vect(0|n) on the ideal gl(V1 ) ⊗ Λ(n). The Lie superalgebra g
has a natural faithful representation ρ in the space V = V1 ⊗ Λ(n) defined by the formulas
                          ρ(X ⊗ ϕ)(v ⊗ ψ) = (−1)p(ϕ)p(ψ) Xv ⊗ ϕψ,
                          ρ(D)(v ⊗ ψ) = −(−1)p(D)p(v) v ⊗ Dψ
for any X ∈ gl(V1 ), ϕ, ψ ∈ Λ(n), v ∈ V1 , D ∈ vect(0|n). Let us identify the elements from g
with their images under ρ, so we consider g embedded into gl(V ).
   Theorem ([48]) 1) The Lie superalgebra gl(V1 ) ⊗ Λ(n) ⊂    + vect(0|n) is maximal irreducible
in sl(V1 ⊗ Λ(n)) unless a) dim V1 = (1, 1) or b) n = 1 and dim V1 = (1, 0) or (0, 1) or (r|s)
for r 6= s.
   2) If dim V1 = (1, 1), then gl(1|1) ∼
                                       = Λ(1) ⊂
                                              + vect(0|1), so
                    gl(V1 ) ⊗ Λ(n) ⊂
                                   + vect(0|n) ⊂ Λ(n + 1) ⊂
                                                          + vect(0|n + 1)
and it is the bigger superalgebra which is maximal irreducible in sl(V ).
   3) If n = 1 and dim V1 = (r|s) for r > s > 0, then g is maximal irreducible in gl(V ).
   Conjecture. Suppose r + s = 2N . Then, dim V coincides with dim Λ(W ) for some
space W . We suspect that this coincidence is not accidental but is occasioned by the spinor
representations of the maximal subalgebras described above. The same applies to q(V1 ) ⊗
Λ(n) ⊂+ vect(0|n), a maximal irreducible subalgebra in q(V1 ⊗ Λ(n)).
   4.5. Selected problems. 1) The spinor and oscillator representations are realized in
the symmetric (perhaps, supersymmetric) algebra of the maximal isotropic (at least for
g = sp(2k) and o(2k)) subspace V of the identity g-module id = V ⊕ V ∗ . But one could
have equally well started from another g-module. For an interesting study of spinor repre-
sentations constructed from W 6= id, see [45].
   To consider in a way similar to sec. 2 contact stringy superalgebras g = kL (1|n) and
 M
k (1|n), as well as other stringy superalgebras from the list [21], we have to replace Fλ,µ
with modules Tµ (W ) of (twisted) tensor fields on the supercircle and investigate how does
the highest weight of 1̂ ∈ Osc(Tµ (W )) or 1̂ ∈ Spin(Tµ (W )) constructed from an arbitrary
irreducible co(n)-module W = V ⊕ V ∗ depend on the highest weight of W . (It seems that
the new and absolutely remarkable spinor-like representation Poletaeva recently constructed
[46] is obtained in this way.)
   To give the reader a feel of calculations, we consider here the simplest nontrivial case
o(3) = sl(2). The results may (and will) be used in calculations of Spin(Tµ (W )) for
g = kL (1|n) and kM (1|n) for n = 3, 4. As is known, for every N ∈ Z+ there exists an
12                            DIMITRY LEITES1 , IRINA SHCHEPOCHKINA2

irreducible (N + 1)-dimensional g-module with highest weight N. This module possesses a
natural nondegenerate g-invariant bilinear form which is skew-symmetric for N = 2k + 1 and
symmetric for N = 2k. The corresponding embeddings g −→ o(2k + 1) and g −→ sp(2k)
are called principal, see [19] and references therein.
                                                P − Explicitly, the images of the Chevalley
              ±                            −
generators X of sl(2) are as follows: X 7→ Xi ,

                                    +

                                     1≤i≤N −1

  From the commutation relations between X + and X − we derive that only XN± give a
nontrivial contribution to the highest weight HW of the sl(2)-module Spin(LN ); we have:
                                  (
                                     N(N + 1) if N = 2k + 1
                           HW =
                                     − 21 N 2   if N = 2k.
  2) Observe, that the notion of spinor-oscillator representation can be broadened to embrace
the subalgebras of the Lie superalgebra h of Hamiltonian vector fields and their images under
quantization; we call the through map the projective spinor-oscillator representation. Since
the Lie superalgebra h has more deformations than po ([40]), and since the sets of maximal
simple subalgebras of po and h are distinct, the set of examples of projective spinor-oscillator
representations differs from that of spinor-oscillator representations.
