                                                       Theorem of Peng and Xiao
                                                                            Andrew Hubery


                                             In his seminal article [13], Ringel showed how to associate to any finitary ring Λ
                                             an associative unital algebra H(Λ), with structure constants encoding informa-
                                             tion about extensions between finite modules. This generalised the Hall algebra
                                             [3, 17], which deals with the ring of p-adic integers Zp and finite p-groups.
                                             In the subsequent article [14] it is shown that if Λ is a representation-directed
                                             algebra over a finite field k, then the structure constants are given by evaluating
                                             integer polynomials. Using these Hall polynomials as structure constants, one
                                             may therefore form the generic Ringel-Hall algebra over Z[T ]. Let n(Λ) be the
                                             subgroup of H(Λ) generated by the indecomposable modules. If we specialise
                                             T 7→ 1, then Z⊗Z[T ] n(Λ) becomes a Lie subalgebra of Z⊗Z[T ] H(Λ). In fact, over
                                             the rational numbers, Q ⊗Z[T ] H(Λ) is isomorphic to the universal enveloping
                                             algebra of Q ⊗Z[T ] n(Λ).
                                             In particular, let Λ be a representation-finite hereditary k-algebra and let g =
                                             n− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ be the semisimple complex Lie algebra of the same type as Λ. Then
                                             Z⊗Z[T ] n(Λ) can be identified with the Chevalley Z-form of n+ , and Z⊗Z[T ] H(Λ)
                                             becomes the Kostant Z-form of the universal enveloping algebra U (n+ ) [15].
                                             For a general finite dimensional hereditary k-algebra Λ one considers the com-
                                             position algebra, the subalgebra generated by the simple modules. This also
                                             has a generic version, constructed as a subalgebra of a direct product over in-
                                             finitely many finite fields of composition algebras [16]. Green showed in [2] that
                                             the generic composition algebra (after twisting the multiplication via the Euler
                                             form of the category modΛ) is isomorphic to the quantum group of the same
                                             type as Λ.
                                             Therefore, we can realise the quantum group of any symmetrisable Kac-Moody
                                             Lie algebra via the module categories of finite dimensional hereditary k-algebras.
                                             A natural question is whether it is possible to obtain the full (quantised) envelop-
                                             ing algebra, or at least the full Lie algebra. The latter question was answered
                                             by Peng and Xiao in [9] for the affine Lie algebras of type A, e and in [10] for the
                                             simple complex Lie algebras, using the root category D (modΛ)/T 2. Finally,
                                                                                                          b

                                             these methods were generalised to all 2-periodic triangulated k-categories (sat-
                                             isfying some finiteness conditions), and in particular to the root category of a
                                             finite dimensional hereditary k-algebra [11].


                                                                                      1
In particular, given any symmetrisable generalised Cartan matrix, the (derived)
Kac-Moody Lie algebra can be realised via the root categories (together with
the Grothendieck groups) of finite dimensional hereditary k-algebras.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the approach taken by Peng and Xiao yields
an associative algebra.
In this article, we offer a simplified and more intuitive proof of the theorem
of Peng and Xiao [11]. We begin by providing a more categorical proof of the
associativity of multiplication for the standard Ringel-Hall algebras. Until now
the proof has relied on counting filtrations, and so cannot easily be adapted to
triangulated categories. The new proof exhibited in Section 2 works in the set-
ting of an exact category, with the key result being Proposition 2. Replacing the
pull-back/push-out diagram by the Octahedral Axiom immediately yields the
analogous Proposition 6 for triangulated categories. This clarifies and improves
the results in Section 6 of [11].
In Section 4 we offer a unified approach to the calculations in Section 7 of [11],
and then use these results to prove the Jacobi identity. We note that in Case
(I), an extra argument is required to prove that coefficient of h̃X vanishes. This
argument is missing in [11].
In the final section we consider when we can endow the Lie algebra with a
symmetric bilinear form. Contrary to [11], this is not always possible, even for
the root category of a finite dimensional hereditary k-algebra, since it is not
in general defined on the Cartan subalgebra. The best we can hope for is to
define the form on h × h1 , where h1 is a subgroup of the Cartan subalgebra. The
proof that this is invariant then follows from our previous considerations on the
Jacobi identity.
We remark that Toën has recently shown how to construct an associative algebra
from a dg-category [18] (under some finiteness assumptions), and it will clearly
be of interest to investigate the connections between his derived Hall algebra
and the quantised enveloping algebras.

1    The Main Theorem
Let k be a finite field and let T be an idempotent complete triangulated k-
category. We shall also assume that T is skeletally small, so the isomorphism
classes of objects form a set, and 2-periodic, i.e. T 2 ∼
                                                        = 1, where T is the shift
of T . Note that for X indecomposable, End X is a finite dimensional local
k-algebra. Set d(X) := dim(End X/rad End X).



                                        2
 The Grothendieck group G of T is the quotient of the free abelian group with
 generators the isomorphism classes of objects in T by the relations [X]+[Y ]−[L]
 whenever there exists an exact triangle Y → L → X → T Y . Denote by hX
 the image of [X] in G. Note that hT M = −hM for all objects M , and that the
 group is generated by all hX for X indecomposable. The Grothendieck group
 is called proper if hX 6= 0 in h for all indecomposable objects X.
 We call T finitary if all homomorphism spaces are finite sets and, given a fixed
 element h ∈ G, there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecompos-
 able objects X (up to shift) with hX = h.
 Main Theorem. Let k be a finite field with qk elements and let T be a skeletally
 small and idempotent complete triangulated k-category. Assume also that T is
 finitary and 2-periodic with proper Grothendieck group. Then we can associate
 to T a Lie algebra g(T ) over the ring Z/(qk − 1)Z.

 The rest of the article is devoted to proving this theorem.


 2    The Ringel-Hall Algebra of an Exact Category
 We recall the definition of an exact category. Let A be an additive category and
 let E be a class of kernel-cokernel pairs (f, g), closed under isomorphism. We
 call f an inflation, g a deflation and (f, g) a conflation.
 The pair (A, E) is an exact category in the sense of Quillen [7] (see also the
 appendix to [4]) if the following axioms hold .
         1
(Ex0) 0 −
        → 0 is a deflation.
(Ex1) The composition of two deflations is again a deflation.
(Ex2) For f : Y → L and a deflation m : M → L there exists a pull-back
                                               f′
                                     L′             /M

                                          m′          m
                                              f      
                                     Y              /L

      with m′ a deflation.
(Ex3) For m′ : L′ → Y and an inflation f ′ : L′ → M there exists a push-out
                                               f′
                                     L′             /M

                                          m′          m
                                              f      
                                     Y              /L

      with f an inflation.

                                           3
We recall the following result from [4].
Lemma 1. The product of two inflations is again an inflation. Moreover, the
pair ((f ′ − m′ )t , (m f )) obtained from either (Ex2) or (Ex3) is a conflation.

The Grothendieck group G of A is the quotient of the free abelian group with
generators the isomorphism classes of objects of A by the relations [X]+[Y ]−[L]
whenever there exists a conflation Y → L → X. Denote by hX the image of
[X] in G.
We call A finitary if each homomorphism group is finite and, given any h ∈ G,
there exist only finitely many isomorphism classes [X] with hX = h. N.B. The
category of finite modules over a finitary ring, in the sense of Ringel [14], is then
a finitary abelian category.
                                                                 L
Let A be a finitary and skeletally small exact category and let WXY denote the
set of all conflations Y → L → X. The group Aut(X, Y ) := Aut X × Aut Y
            L
acts on WXY    via
                                             f               g
                                   Y                 /L              /X
                                        η                                 ξ
                                            f               g         
                                   Y                 /L              /X
                                   L
and we denote the quotient set by VXY . Since f is monic and g epic this action
is free, so                                  L

                         L

                                         |Aut(X, Y )|
The Ringel-Hall algebra H(A) is defined as follows. Form the free Z-module on
generators indexed by the set of isomorphism classes of objects, writing uX for
                            L
u[X] , and use the numbers FXY   as structure constants. That is,
                                       X
                                             L
                            uX uY :=       FXY  uL .
                                                      [L]

We note that this sum is finite and that u0 is a unit for the multiplication. We
now prove that the multiplication is associative.
Let us define an action of Aut(X, Y, Z, L) := Aut X × Aut Y × Aut Z × Aut L
                             L       M
on the pairs of conflations WXY × WLZ    via
                          f        g                                  l            m

                      η        λ                 ξ               ζ                      λ

Dually we have an action of Aut(X, Y, Z, L′ ) on the pairs WXL
                                                            M       L

We fix a complete set of representatives M for all isomorphism classes of objects
of A.

Consider the pair ((f, g), (l, m)) ∈ WXY × WLZ . Let L′ ∈ M be the represen-
tative of the pull-back
                                                               f′
                                                     L′                 /M

Take l′ : Z → L′ such that f ′ l′ = l and m′ l′ = 0. Then l′ is a kernel for the
deflation m′ , so (l′ , m′ ) is a conflation. Similarly, setting g ′ := gm, then g ′ is
a deflation and f ′ is a kernel for g ′ , so (f ′ , g ′ ) is a conflation. Thus we have a
commutative diagram

Now consider the pair ((f , g), (l, m)) = (ξ, η, ζ, λ) · ((f, g), (l, m)). Using the

same construction as above, we obtain ((f , g′ ), (l , m′ )) in WXL

L′′ ∈ M is the representative of the pull-back of m along f .
There exists λ′ giving a morphism of conflations

It follows that λ′ is an isomorphism, hence L′′ = L′ and λ′ ∈ Aut L′ .
Similarly we obtain ξ ′ and ζ ′ giving isomorphisms of conflations

Thus ((f , g′ ), (l , m′ )) = (ξ ′ , η, ζ ′ , λ′ ) · ((f ′ , g ′ ), (l′ , m′ )) and so the two pairs of
conflations lie in the same Aut(X, Y, Z, L′ )-orbit.
In fact, since l′ is monic and g ′ epic, we deduce that ζ ′ = ζ and ξ ′ = ξ.
This proves that the map from left to right is well-defined. Using the symmetry
of the situation, we obtain the required bijection.                          

Theorem 3. The Ringel-Hall algebra H(A) of a finitary and skeletally small
exact category A is an associative, unital algebra.

Suppose further that A is a k-category for some finite field k. Set qk := |k| and
write n for the subgroup of H(A) generated by the uX for X indecomposable.
Theorem 4. Over the ring Z/(qk − 1), n becomes a Lie subalgebra of H(A).

Proof.
                             L
It is enough to show that FXY    − FYLX ≡ 0 mod (qk − 1) whenever X and Y
are indecomposable and L is decomposable (c.f. [16]). We may assume that
X 6∼
   = Y , since otherwise the result is trivial. So suppose that L = L′ ⊕ L′′ and
                               (f ′ f ′′ )t            (g′ g′′ )
consider a conflation Y −−−−−→ L′ ⊕ L′′ −−−−→ X.
If L ∼6 X ⊕
       =                 ∗                         L            L
             Y then k acts freely on ∗the set VXY , hence FXY ≡ 0. For, let
      1
 η, κ , ξ ∈ Aut(Y, L, X) with κ ∈ k be an automorphism of this conflation.
Since A is idempotent complete, End Y is a finite dimensional local k-algebra.
As neither f ′ nor f ′′ is 0, both η − 1 and η − κ are nilpotent. Therefore κ − 1
is also nilpotent, so κ = 1.
Now suppose that L = X ⊕ Y , so that every conflation is split. We may assume
                                                          L ∼
that f ′′ = 1, g ′ = 1 and f ′′ = −g ′ = θ : Y → X. Thus VXY = Hom(Y, X) and
          X⊕Y                                   X⊕Y
hence FXY ≡ 1 mod (qk − 1). Similarly FY X ≡ 1 and we are done.             


3      Triangulated Categories
We would like to imitate this result for a triangulated category T , and in par-
ticular for the root category of a finite dimensional hereditary algebra.


                                                  6
 We first recall the definition of a triangulated category. Let T be an additive
                                                                              f
 category endowed with an equivalence T and let E be a class of triangles Y − →
    g     h
 L−→X−   → T L closed under isomorphism. We call the triangles in E exact.
 The pair (T , E) is a triangulated category if the following axioms hold [12, 19]
 (see also [6, 8]).

                                1
(Tr0) The triangle 0 → X −
                         → X → 0 is exact for all X.
(Tr1) Each map f fits into an exact triangle (f, g, h).
(Tr2) The triangle (f, g, h) is exact if and only if (g, h, −T f ) is exact.
(Tr3) Given two exact triangles (f, g, h) and (f ′ , g ′ , h′ ) and two maps η and λ
      such that λf = f ′ η, there exists a morphism (η, λ, ξ) of exact triangles

                                         f                 g                   h

                                Y′            / L′               / X′                / TY ′

(Tr4′ ) For f : Y → L and m : M → L there exists a morphism of triangles

                                         f′            g′                     h′
                            L′                /M                 /X                 / T L′

                                 m′              m                                      T m′
                                        f             g                     h        
                            Y                 /L                 /X                 / TY

      such that the left hand square is homotopy cartesian with differential
      δ = h′ g. That is, the triangle ((f ′ − m′ )t , (m f ), h′ g) is exact.

 We shall need the following results about triangulated categories. (In fact, none
 of the following needs the axiom (Tr4′ )). A triangle split if it is isomorphic to
                            (0 1)t                     (1 0)              0
 a triangle of the form Y −−−→ X ⊕ Y −−−→ X −
                                            → TY .

                  →X−
                    → T Y be a triangle.

   1. If in (Tr3) η and λ are isomorphisms, then so is ξ;
   2. This triangle is split if and only if h = 0;
   3. Suppose L = M ⊕ P andthat f = (f ′ 0)t . Then (f, g, h) is isomorphic

      to Y −−−−→ M ⊕ P −−−−      → N ⊕ P −−−→ T Y and (f ′ , g ′ , h′ ) is exact. A
      similar result also holds whenever g = (g ′ 0).

Proof.
The first part is Proposition 1.1.20 in [8], and the second part is Corollary 1.2.7.
The third occurs as Lemma 2.5 in [10], but the proof can be simplified as follows.

Y −−−−→ M ⊕ P −−−−    → N ⊕ P −−−→ T Y is exact by Proposition 1.2.1 of [8],
and there exists a morphism (1, 1, ξ) from (f, g, h) to this triangle, which must
be an isomorphism.                                                             
We recall that (Tr4’) is equivalent to the following axiom (Tr4), or the Octahe-
dral Axiom (see [8] or the appendix in [6]).

(Tr4) Given exact triangles (f, g, h), (l, m, n) and (l′ , m′ , n′ ) with n′ = nf , there
      exists an exact triangle (f ′ , g ′ , h′ ) such that the following diagram com-
      mutes

                                    l′                      l

        Moreover, the middle left square is homotopy cartesian with differential
        δ = h′ g = (T l′ )n.

We call T finitary if each homomorphism group is finite and, given any element
h of the Grothendieck group G of T , there exist only finitely many isomorphism
classes of indecomposables [X] (up to shift) with hX = h. In this case we have
another characterisation of split triangles: the triangle (f, g, h) is split if and
only if L ∼
          = X ⊕ Y . For, we can apply the cohomological functor Hom(−, T Y ).
By counting arguments, Hom(h, T Y ) = 0, so h = 0.
Now let T be a finitary and skeletally small triangulated category. We prove
that the analogue of Proposition 2 still holds for T .

Proof.
                                             L     M
Consider the pair ((f, g, h), (l, m, n)) ∈ WXY  × WLZ . Applying (Tr4), we obtain
            ′                   ′ ′    ′   ′  ′  ′      M       L′
for some L ∈ M a pair ((f , g , h ), (l , m , n )) ∈ WXL  ′ × WY Z fitting into a

commutative diagram such that the middle left square is homotopy cartesian
with differential δ = h′ g = (T l′ )n.
Now consider the pair ((f , g, h), (l, m, n)) = (ξ, η, ζ, λ) · ((f, g, h), (l, m, n)). Us-
                                                                 ′      ′     ′
ing (TR4) we again find for some L′′ ∈ M a pair ((f , g′ , h ), (l , m′ , n′ )) ∈

   M        L
WXL  ′′ × WY Z fitting into a commutative diagram such that the middle left

square is homotopy cartesian with differential δ = h g = (T l )n.
Using (Tr3) we can find λ′ giving a morphism of exact triangles

                                                                                 

It follows that λ′ is an isomorphism, hence L′′ = L′ and λ′ ∈ Aut L′ .
Similarly we obtain ξ ′ and ζ ′ giving isomorphisms of exact triangles

We deduce that ((f , g ′ , h ), (l , m′ , n′ )) = (ξ ′ , η, ζ ′ , λ′ ) · ((f ′ , g ′ , h′ ), (l′ , m′ , n′ ))
and so the two pairs of exact triangles lie in the same Aut(X, Y, Z, L′ )-orbit.

                                                                                      9
This shows that the map from left to right is well-defined. Using the symmetry
of the situation, we obtain the required bijection.                         
Remark. In fact, it follows from the proof that h̄′ (ξ ′ − ξ)g = 0 and l̄′ (ζ ′ −
ζ)T −1 n = 0. However, unlike for an exact category, we cannot deduce that
ξ ′ = ξ and ζ ′ = ζ. Similarly, none of the actions described above is free. In
particular, it is not
                     clear
                           whether we can define an associative algebra using the
numbers FXY L          L 
                 := VXY    as structure constants.


4     Reduction modulo qk − 1
From now on, let k be a finite field with qk elements, and T a finitary and
skeletally small triangulated k-category. Furthermore, we assume that T has
split idempotents. Thus the endomorphism ring of an indecomposable object is
a finite dimensional local k-algebra. For an indecomposable X, denote by d(X)
the dimension dimk (End X/rad End X).
Remark. This is not a serious restriction on our triangulated category, since
we can always form the idempotent completion [1].
For fixed indecomposable objects X, Y and Z we will calculate the numbers

FXY  , FLZ and NXY Z :=  Aut(X,Y,Z,L) . It will be convenient to work over the
subring R ⊂ Q obtained by localising Z at the set of numbers coprime to (qk −1).
The method of proof here and later is based on the following observation. If a
finite group G acts on a finite set X, then

                                               = |Hom(T Z,M)| .

Proof.
Suppose first that L ∼  6 M ⊕ T Z. Using the observation, we shall prove that
                         =
the stabilisers are all bijective to vector spaces and hence have size 1 modulo
(qk − 1).
                     M
For t = (l, m, n) ∈ WLZ define
              S(t) := {(ζ − 1, 0, λ − 1) ∈ End t | (ζ, λ) ∈ Stab(t)}.
Here we have written End t for the subalgebra of End Z × End M × End L con-
sisting of all triples (ζ, µ, λ) giving a morphism of the triangle t.

                                        10
Clearly S(t) is in bijection with Stab(t) and contains 0. For (ζ̄, 0, λ̄) ∈ S(t) we
know that ζ̄ is either nilpotent or an isomorphism, and that lζ̄ = 0. Since l 6= 0,
ζ̄ is nilpotent.
Let (ζ̄i , 0, λ̄i ) for i = 1, 2 be two elements of S(t) and let α ∈ k. Then ζ̄ := ζ̄1 +
αζ̄2 is nilpotent, and hence ζ := 1 + ζ̄ is an isomorphism. Set λ := 1 + λ̄1 + αλ̄2 ,
so that (ζ, 1, λ) ∈ End t. Thus λ is an isomorphism and so (ζ, λ) ∈ Stab(t).
Therefore S(t) is a vector subspace of End t. This proves Part 1.
Now suppose that L = M ⊕ T Z. There is a unique orbit, represented by the
            0      (1 0)t             (0 1)
triangle Z −
           → M −−−→ M     ⊕ T Z −−−→ T Z. Clearly (ζ, λ) stablises this triangle
if and only if λ = 10 Tθζ for some θ : T Z → M .                               

   3. We have WXY  =
                              |Hom(X,Y )| .


Proof.
This first part follows from the previous lemma, since X ∼   = L ⊕ T Y and X and
Y indecomposable implies L ∼   = 0.
Suppose L = X ⊕ Y and X ∼    6 Y . Since every triangle (f, g, h) is split, each orbit
                              =
is represented by a triangle of the form ((θ 1)t , (1 − θ), 0) for some θ : Y → X.
These orbits are all distinct, and have trivial stabilisers.
                  X⊕Y                                               Y
Finally consider WXY  . By rotation, this set is in bijection with WX⊕Y T −1 X ,
whose size we know by the previous lemma.                                    

4.2    The numbers NXY Z

Lemma 9. If L ∼                LM
              6 M ⊕ T Z, then NXY
               =                       L   M
                                  Z ≡ FXY FLZ .


Proof.
                                 LM        L      M
If L = 0, then it is clear that NXY Z = FXY FLZ , and this equals 0 unless both
X∼ = T Y and Z ∼ = M , in which case it equals 1.
Suppose L 6∼                                                L
            = 0 and let (t, u) := ((f, g, h), (l, m, n)) ∈ WXY    M
                                                               × WLZ . For β an
automorphism write β̄ := β − 1 and define
                          ¯ (ζ̄, 0, λ̄)) ∈ End t × End u | (ξ, η, ζ, λ) ∈ Stab(t, u)}.
    S(t, u) := {((η̄, λ̄, ξ),

As before, S(t, u) is in bijection with Stab(t, u) and contains the zero morphism.
              ¯ (ζ̄, 0, λ̄)) ∈ S(t, u) we know that ζ̄ is nilpotent, say ζ̄ r−1 = 0. Then
For ((η̄, λ̄, ξ),
   r−1
nλ̄     = 0, so λ̄r−1 = mθ for some θ : L → M . Hence λ̄r = 0, since λ̄m = 0.



                                              11
We now have (η̄ r , 0, ξ̄ r ) ∈ End t. If ξ̄ r is an automorphism, then g = 0 and the
rotation (−T −1 h, f, g) of t is split. Since X and Y are indecomposable, L ∼    = 0,
a contradiction. Hence ξ¯ is nilpotent. Similarly η̄ is nilpotent.
Let ((η̄i , λ̄i , ξ̄i ), (ζ̄i , 0, λ̄i )) for i = 1, 2 be two elements of S(t, u) and let α ∈ k.
Set ξ¯ := ξ̄1 + αξ¯2 and ξ := 1 + ξ,               ¯ and similarly for η, ζ and λ. Then ξ̄, η̄
and ζ̄ are nilpotent, so ξ, η and ζ are isomorphisms. Since ((η, λ, ξ), (ζ, 1, λ)) ∈
End t × End u, λ must also be an isomorphism and so (ξ, η, ζ, λ) ∈ Stab(t, u).
Therefore S(t, u) is a vector subspace of End t × End u.

         i) If M 6∼           LM
                  = Y , then NXY Z = 1.

Every orbit is represented by a pair (t, u) = (f, g, h), (0, (1 0)t , (0 1)) . We
                                                                        
shall use the terminology of the previous lemma. Then λ = 01 Tθζ for some
θ : T Z → M.
Write f = (f1 f2 )t and g = (g1 g2 ). Then

    f1 η̄ = θf2 ,   f2 η̄ = (T ζ̄)f2 ,   ξ̄g1 = 0,    ξ̄g2 = g1 θ + g2 (T ζ̄),          ¯
                                                                                 η̄h = hξ.

1. If L ∼
        6 X ⊕ Y then ξ,
         =              ¯ η̄ and ζ̄ are all nilpotent. For, if ξ¯ is an automorphism,
                      ∼
then g1 = 0 and Y = M ⊕ Y ′ by Lemma 5. Since Y is indecomposable and
M ∼ 6 0, we must have that Y ∼
     =                               = M and X ∼     = T Z, hence L ∼     = X ⊕ Y, a
                      ¯
contradiction. Thus ξ is nilpotent. Now, if η̄ is an automorphism, then h = 0.
Thus t is split and L ∼
                      = X ⊕Y , a contradiction. Finally, if ζ̄ is an automorphism,
then f2 = 0 and Lemma 5 applies to give X ∼     = M and Y ∼ = T Z, hence L ∼ = X⊕Y ,
a contradiction.
Therefore S(t, u) is a vector subspace of End t × End u and the result follows,
using the formula for WLZ M 
                               .
                          ∼
2. Now suppose that L = X ⊕ Y . Then t is split and h = 0. Also, either f1 or
f2 is an isomorphism.



                                              12
Suppose that f2 is an isomorphism, so we may identify Y = T Z and X = M .
Then there is a unique orbit for (t, u), given by the pair of split triangles. It
follows that ξ = 1, θ = 0 and η = T ζ, so the stabiliser is isomorphic to Aut Y .
Conversely, suppose that f2 is not an isomorphism. Then we may identify
Y = M and X = T Z, and t is represented by ((1 φ)t , (−φ 1), 0) with φ : Y → X
not an isomorphism. We note the conditions
                                                                
             ξφ = φ, T ζ = ξ + φθ, η = 1 + θφ, λ = 10 Tθζ .

Since φ is not an isomorphism, η is necessarily invertible, and ζ and λ are
invertible if and only if ξ is. Therefore the stabiliser is determined by θ and ξ
such that ξ̄φ = 0.
If φ = 0, then the stabiliser is isomorphic to Aut X × Hom(X, Y ). Otherwise,
if φ 6= 0, then ξ̄ must be nilpotent and the stabiliser is in bijection with some
subspace of rad End X × Hom(X, Y ).
We conclude that if M 6= ∼ Y , then N LM = 1.

where r = dim rad End X. Thus

5     The Jacobi Identity
In order to prove the Jacobi identity, we shall need two further assumptions on
our triangulated category T . Firstly, we need that T is 2-periodic, i.e. T 2 ∼
                                                                              = 1.
We note that this is satisfied for the root category Db (modΛ)/T 2 for Λ a finite
dimensional hereditary k-algebra [10] (see also [5]). We shall also need that for
X indecomposable, hX 6= 0 in G. The latter condition is referred to as proper
in [11].
We continue to work over the ring R/(qk − 1).
                                             hX
For X indecomposable, define h̃X :=         d(X)    in Q ⊗Z G and set h to be the integer
lattice generated by the h̃X . Define a bilinear form on h by setting (hX | hY ) to
be the alternating sum

    dim Hom(X, Y ) − dim Hom(X, T Y ) + dim Hom(Y, X) − dim Hom(Y, T X).

Note that (h̃X | hY ) ∈ Z for all indecomposable objects X and Y .
Define n to be the free abelian group on generators indexed by the isomorphism
classes of indecomposable objects, writing uX for u[X] .
In this section, X, Y and Z will again denote indecomposable objects.
We define a bracket product on g := h ⊕ n via the formulae
                          (P
                                      L     L
                              L ind (FXY − FY X )uL if X 6∼
                                                          = TY ;
            [uX , uY ] :=                                ∼
                           h̃X                      if X = T Y,
              [h̃X , uY ] := −(h̃X | hY )uY ,      [uY , h̃X ] = (h̃X | hY )uY
              [h̃X , h̃Y ] := 0.

Clearly this is antisymmetric. It is well defined from the finiteness condition on
the Grothedieck group.
We wish to prove the Jacobi identity

                [[uX , uY ], uZ ] − [[uX , uZ ], uY ] − [[uZ , uY ], uX ] ≡ 0

in the following three cases.

                                             14
  (I) X, Y 6∼= T Z and X 6∼
                          = T Y . In this case,

                                                                          )h̃Z .

                       L6∼
                         =T Z


 (II) X, Y ∼
           6 T Z and X ∼
            =          = T Y . In this case, [[uX , uY ], uZ ] = −(h̃X | hZ )uZ .
(III) X ∼
        =Y ∼
           = T Z. In this case, the Jacobi identity is trivial.

N.B. It is enough to consider these cases. For, if X ∼  = T Z and Y ∼6 T Z, then
                                                                      =
either X =6 T Y and we can use the triple (uZ , uX , uY ), or X ∼
          ∼                                                     = T Y and we can
                                               6 T Z and Y ∼
use the triple (uY , uZ , uX ). Similarly if X ∼=           = T Z.
                                           L
Lemma 12. If L is decomposable or 0, then FXY − FYLX ≡ 0.

Proof.
For L = 0 this is clear, so suppose that L is decomposable, say L = M ⊕ T Z
with Z indecomposable and M ∼   6 0. If L ∼
                                 =        6 X ⊕ Y , then by Lemmas 8 and 10,
                                           =
                               L 
                              W 
                     L           XY                LM
                  FXY   ≡               ≡ |Aut Z| NXY Z ≡ 0.
                           |Aut(X, Y )|

If L = X ⊕ Y but X ∼  6 Y , then by Lemma 8, FXY
                       =                         L
                                                   = |Hom(Y, X)| ≡ 1. Finally,
     ∼
if X = Y , then the left hand side is clearly 0.                            
This implies that in the expression for [[uX , uY ], uZ ] in Case (I), we can remove
the restriction that L is indecomposable. Moreover, since the Grothedieck group
is proper, we can remove the restriction that L ∼    6 T Z. For, FTMZZ 6= 0 implies
                                                      =
hM = 0, so that M is decomposable.

                                 L               L

N.B. This summation makes sense in R/(qk − 1), since if L is decomposable and
                                L
not isomorphic to X ⊕ Y , then FXY ≡ 0.
Using Lemmas 9 and 11, Proposition 6 and that T 2 = 1 we see that

                FM⊕T ZZ − FXM⊕T X FY Z   − NXY Z   + N̂XY Z   .

Substituting this into cM , the part involving the F s can be expressed as
          M⊕T Z
        (FXY    − FYM⊕T
                     X
                        Z   M

                                                     − FZY    )

together with two other terms given by cyclically permuting (X, Y, Z). These
all vanish by Lemma 12.

                                        15
It remains to consider the terms involving N and N̂ . By our conditions on
(X, Y, Z), we must always be in Case 1 of Lemmas 10 and 11. We see that
  |WXY
    M ⊕T Z
           |                      M⊕T ZM                     MM⊕T Z
|Aut(X,Y,Z)| occurs once from NXY Z        and once from N̂ZXY      , and these
cancel in cM . Similarly for each of the other permutations.
We deduce that the coefficient of uM in the Jacobi identity is 0.
It remains to consider the terms lying in h. That is, we need to check that

                                        )h̃Y + (FZY − FYT ZX )h̃X ≡ 0.
Lemma 13. Let t : Y → Z → X → T Y be a triangle. Then End t is local.

Proof.
We will show that if one of ξ, η or ζ is nilpotent, then they all are.
Suppose that ξ is nilpotent, say ξ m = 0. Then (η m , ζ m , 0) ∈ End t, and since t
is not split, η m must be nilpotent. Similarly, after rotating the triangle, we see
that ζ is nilpotent.                                                             
Set d(t) := dim(End t/rad End t). The above proof shows that we have a natural
monomorphism
                     End t/rad End t → End X/rad End X,
and hence d(t) divides d(X), and similarly d(Y ) and d(Z).

The group Aut(X, Y, Z) acts on the set WXY  , so

This completes the proof of the Jacobi identity in Case (I).
Case (II) Since the Grothendieck group is proper, uX does not occur in
                                                           M
[uX , uZ ]. Furthermore, all numbers of the form FXT          X vanish. Therefore
                                                              X
                 −[[uX , uZ ], uT X ] − [[uZ , uT X ], uX ] =    cM u M ,
                                                        M


                                        16
where

     cM = ∆M        M        M        M        M        M
           XT XZ + ∆T XZX + ∆ZXT X − ∆T XXZ − ∆ZT XX − ∆XZT X .

In particular, this lies entirely in n.
As before, the part of cM involving the F s vanishes. For the terms involving N
and N̂ , we have two cases, depending on whether M ∼    = Z or not. If M ∼ 6 Z,
                                                                            =
then we are always in Case 1 of Lemmas 10 and 11, and cM ≡ 0 as in Case (I).
So suppose that M = Z. Then, for example,

  M⊕T ZM         |WXT
                    M ⊕T Z
                           |                      dim Hom(Z,T X)
 NXT XZ  ≡      |Aut(X,Y,Z)| ,
                       X
                                 NTM⊕T
                                    XZX
                                       XM
                                          ≡1+          d(X)      ,    M⊕XM
                                                                     NZXT X ≡ 1.

A short calculation (noting Hom(T X, Z) ∼         = Hom(X, T Z)) reveals that cZ =
(h̃X | hZ ). Since [[uX , uT X ], uZ ] = −(h̃X | hZ )uZ , we are done.
We have therefore shown that the Jacobi identity is satisfied for all triples
(uX , uY , uZ ).
                                                                                ∼ TY ;
Now consider the triple (uX , uY , h̃Z ). Then [[uX , uY ], h̃Z ] equals 0 if X =
otherwise we have
                           X
                               L
      [[uX , uY ], h̃Z ] =   (FXY − FYLX )[uL , h̃Z ] = (h̃Z | hX + hY )[uX , uY ].
                       L ind

The Jacobi identity follows immediately. The remaining case (uX , h̃Y , h̃Z ) is
easily checked.
This completes the proof of the Main Theorem.


6     The Symmetric Bilinear Form
It would clearly be of interest to extend the symmetric bilinear form to an
invariant form on the whole of the Lie algebra g/(qk − 1)g. Unfortunately,
this is not always possible since although (h̃X | hY ) ∈ Z, it is not true that
(h̃X | h̃Y ) ∈ Z. In fact, this even fails for the root category Db (modΛ)/T 2 of a
finite dimensional hereditary k-algebra Λ (for example, when Λ is the F4 -species
of type G2 ).
One important special case when we can define the bilinear form is when Λ = kQ
is the path algebra of a quiver. For, the Grothendieck group is in this case freely
generated by the simple modules, and these all have trivial endomorphism rings.
In general, define h1 to be the sublattice of h generated by hX for X indecom-
posable. Set g1 := h1 ⊕ n and extend the bilinear form on h × h1 to the whole
of g × g1 via
                                                (
                                                  1 if X ∼= TY ;
                (h̃X | uY ) := 0, (uX | uY ) :=
                                                  0 otherwise.

                                          17
This form is then invariant over R/(qk − 1) in the sense that

                   (h̃X | [uY , uZ ])d(Z) ≡ −([h̃X , uY ] | uZ )
               and d(X)([uX , uY ] | uZ ) ≡ (uX | [uY , uZ ])d(Z).

For the first condition, both sides are 0 unless Y ∼= T Z, in which case they are
both congruent to (h̃X |hY ). For the second, we need to show that
                           TZ
                                                            
                   d(X) FXY    − FYT X
                                     Z
                                         ≡ d(Z) FYT ZX − FZY
                                                          TX
                                                              .

As in Case (I) of the Jacobi identity, we know that
                                  X d(X)d(Z)
                         TZ
                    d(X)FXY ≡                    ≡ d(Z)FYT ZX ,
                                   t
                                         d(t)

and we are done.
