                                             1     Introduction
                                             Let Γ ⊂ SL2 (C) be a finite subgroup, and r be the number of conjugacy classes of Γ. Let D be the algebra of
                                             polynomial differential operators in one variable with complex coefficients. In the paper [CBH98], Crawley-
                                             Boevey and Holland introduced an r-parameter family of algebras Ht,c1 ,...,cr−1 over C, which is a universal
                                             deformation of the semidirect product algebra CΓ ⋉ D. They also described their representation theory,
                                             showing that it is related to the structure of the root system attached to Γ via the McKay’s correspondence.
                                                 The algebras of Crawley-Boevey and Holland are the simplest case of so called symplectic reflection
                                             algebras introduced in [EG02]. These algebras have interesting representation theory, about which little is
                                             known. The better understood case is that of rational Cherednik algebras corresponding to complex reflection
                                             groups [DO03, GGOR, CE], and especially that of real reflection (in particular, Weyl) groups [BEG03, Gor].
                                             In the Weyl case, these algebras admit a q-deformation defined by Cherednik, whose representation theory
                                             (while having some similarities to the rational case) can be effectively studied by the technique of intertwiners
                                             [Che03] or geometric representation theory [Vas].
                                                 The goal of this paper is to begin the study of representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras
                                             in positive characteristic. Namely, we study the simplest case of rank 1, i.e. the algebras of [CBH98] for
                                             Γ = Z/rZ in characteristic p, which is prime to r. Our main result is a complete description of irreducible
                                             representations of such algebras.
                                                 The paper is organized as follows.
                                                 In Section 2, we state the main results.
                                                 In Section 3, we prove the results for the “quantum” case, i.e. the case when the “Planck’s constant” t
                                             is nonzero. In this case, generic irreducible representations have dimension pr.
                                                 In Section 4, we prove the results for the “classical” case, i.e. the case when the “Planck’s constant” t is
                                             zero. In this case, generic irreducible representations have dimension r.

                                             Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p and r ≥ 1 a positive integer relatively prime to p.
                                             Let ε ∈ k be a primitive r-th root of unity.
                                             Definition 2.1. Let t, c1 , ..., cr−1 ∈ k. The algebra Ht,c1 ,...,cr−1 over k is generated by x, y, s with relations
                                                                                                                              r−1
                                                                                                                              X
                                                                          sr = 1,   sx = ε−1 xs,   sy = εys,   [y, x] = t −         cj s j .
                                                                                                                              j=1



                                                                                                      1
    In characteristic zero, this algebra has been studied in [CBH98]. In the sequel, we fix c1 , ..., cr−1 and
denote the algebra Ht,c1 ,...,cr−1 simply by Ht .
    We will classify irreducible representations of Ht . In particular, we show that they are all finite dimen-
sional.
    It is clear that for t 6= 0, Ht is isomorphic to H1 with rescaled parameters cj . Thus it is sufficient to
classify irreducible representations of H0 and H1 . So we set H1 = H, H0 = H′ .
Remark 2.2. In the trivial case r = 1, H′ is the polynomial algebra in two variables and H is the Weyl
algebra. In the case r = 2, as pointed out in [CM02], H is a quotient of the universal enveloping algebra
U(osp(1, 2)) of the Lie superalgebra osp(1, 2) by a central character.
   Below we will need the element
                                                           r−1
                                               def
                                                           X
                                              h = xy −           cj (1 − ε−j )−1 sj ,
                                                           j=1

both in H and H′ . This element (in the case r = 2) was introduced in [CM02].

2.1    Irreducible representations of H
The elements xpr , ypr are central in H. Thus they have to act as scalars in irreducible representations.
Proposition 2.3. Suppose that a, b ∈ k are not both zero. Then, for each β ∈ k which satisfies the equation
                                      r−1
                                      Y          X                    
                                             f β+   cj (1 − ε−j )−1 εmj = ab,                                           (1)
                                      m=0
where f (z) = z p − z, there exists a unique irreducible representation Vβ,a,b of H, where xpr acts on Vβ,a,b
through multiplication by a, ypr acts on Vβ,a,b through multiplication by b, and the spectrum of h in Vβ,a,b is
β + Fp .
    Explicitly, the representation Vβ,a,b looks as follows. Let
                                                           r−1
                                                           X
                                        µi = β + i +             cj (1 − ε−j )−1 ε−ij ,
                                                           j=1

for all i = 0, ..., pr − 1. Then for a 6= 0 the representation Vβ,a,b has a basis {v0 , v1 , . . . , vpr−1 } in which
                                        xvi     = vi+1        for i = 0, . . . , pr − 2,
                                    xvpr−1      = av0 ,
                                        yvi     = µi vi−1 for i = 1, . . . , pr − 1,
                                        yv0     = a −1 µ0 vpr−1 ,
                                        svi     = ε−i vi .        for i = 0, . . . , pr − 1.
On the other hand, if a = 0 (but b 6= 0), we have
                                       xvi     =     µi+1 vi+1       for i = 0, . . . , pr − 2,
                                                      −1
                                   xvpr−1      =     b µ0 v0 ,
                                      yvi      =     vi−1 for i = 1, . . . , pr − 1,
                                       yv0     =     bvpr−1 ,
                                       svi     =     ε−i vi . for i = 0, . . . , pr − 1.
Thus dim Vβ,a,b = pr. Two roots β and β ′ of (1) yield isomorphic representations if and only if β − β ′ ∈ Fp .
Furthermore, every irreducible representation of H on which xpr and ypr do not both act as zero is of the
form Vβ,a,b for some β, a, b.

                                                                 2
Example 2.4.  For r = 2, Vβ,a,b (a 6= 0) will has the following form:

Proposition 2.5. For each m ∈ Z/rZ, there exists a unique irreducible representation Wm of H with
xpr = ypr = 0 and sv = εm v whenever yv = 0. The dimension D ≤ pr of Wm is the smallest positive integer
satisfying the equation
                                              D−1

Wm has a basis {v0 , v1 , . . . , vD−1 }, such that

                                          xvi    =     vi+1 ,       for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 2,
                                      xvD−1      =     0,

where µk = k − i=0 j=1 cj ε(m−i)j . Every irreducible representation of H on which xpr and ypr both act
as zero is of the form Wm for some m.
Remark 2.6. For generic cj , we have dim Wm = pr for all m.

2.2     Irreducible representations of H′
The elements xr , yr and h are central in H′ , so they must act as scalars in irreducible representations.
Proposition 2.7. Suppose that a, b ∈ k are not both zero. Then, for each β which satisfies the equation

                                               m=0            j=1


there exists a unique irreducible representation Vβ,a,b of H′ , where xr acts on Vβ,a,b through multiplication
by a, yr acts on Vβ,a,b through multiplication by b, and h acts on Vβ,a,b through multiplication by β.
    Explicitly, the representation Vβ,a,b looks as follows. Let
                                                        r−1
                                                        X
                                           µi = β +            cj (1 − ε−j )−1 ε−ij ,

for all i = 0, ..., r − 1. Then for a 6= 0 the representation Vβ,a,b has a basis {v0 , v1 , . . . , vr−1 } in which

                                         xvi    =     vi+1       for i = 0, . . . , r − 2,
                                      xvr−1     =     av0 ,
                                        yvi     =     µi vi−1 for i = 1, . . . , r − 1,
                                        yv0     =     a−1 µ0 vr−1 ,
                                         svi    =     ε−i vi .      for i = 0, . . . , r − 1.

                                                                    3
On the other hand, if a = 0 (but b 6= 0), we have

                                        xvi     = µi+1 vi+1         for i = 0, . . . , r − 2,
                                     xvr−1      = b−1 µ0 v0 ,
                                       yvi      = vi−1 for i = 1, . . . , r − 1,
                                       yv0      = bvr−1 ,
                                        svi     = ε−i vi .     for i = 0, . . . , r − 1.

Thus dim Vβ,a,b = r. Every irreducible representation of H′ on which xr and yr do not both act as zero is of
the form Vβ,a,b for some β, a, b.
Proposition 2.8. For each m ∈ Z/rZ, there exists a unique irreducible representation Wm of H′ with
xr = yr = 0 and sv = εm v whenever yv = 0. The dimension D ≤ r of Wm is the smallest positive integer
satisfying the equation
                                           D−1

                                                       i=0 j=1

Wm has a basis {v0 , v1 , . . . , vD−1 }, such that

                                          xvi     =   vi+1 ,    for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 2,
                                      xvD−1       =   0,
                                         yvi      =   µi vi−1       for 1 ≤ i ≤ D − 1,
                                          yv0     =   0,
                                          svi     =   εm−i vi       for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 1,
                Pk−1 Pr−1
where µk = − i=0 j=1 cj ε(m−i)j . Every irreducible representation of H′ on which xr and yr both act as

3     Proof of propositions 2.3 and 2.5
Lemma 3.1 (PBW for H, easy direction). The elements

                                         xi yj sl ,    0 ≤ i, j,       0≤l ≤r−1

span H over k.
Proof. Given a product
                    Pr−1of x, y, s in any order, one can ensure that the y’s are to the right of all the x’s by
using yx = xy + 1 − j=1 cj sj repeatedly, and one can also ensure that the s’s are to the right of all the x’s
and y’s by using sx = ε−1 xs and sy = εys repeatedly.
Lemma 3.2. xpr and ypr belong to the center Z(H) of H.
Proof. First, let us show that xpr ∈ Z(H). It is enough to show that [xpr , y] = [xr , s] = 0. But xr s = εr sxr =




                                                                4
                                            Pr−1
sxr , so [xr , s] = 0. Now let g(s) = 1 −       j=1 cj s
                                                           j
                                                               . Then,

                        yxr   = (yx)xr−1
                              = (xy + g(s))xr−1
                              = x(yx)xr−2 + g(s)xr−1
                              = ···
                              = xr y + g(s)xr−1 + xg(s)xr−2 + · · · + xr−1 g(s)

                              = xr y + rxr−1 +                   cj sj xr−1 + xsj xr−2 + · · · + xr−1 sj
                                                                                                           
                                                       j=1
                                                       r−1
                                                       X
                              = xr y + rxr−1 +                   cj (1 + εj + · · · + εj(r−1) )sj xr−1
                                                       j=1

                              = xr y + rxr−1 ,

since 1 + z + · · · + z r−1 = 0 whenever z 6= 1 is an r-th root of unity. Thus [y, xr ] = rxr−1 , and hence
[y, xpr ] = prxpr−1 = 0.
     This completes the proof that xpr ∈ Z(H). The proof that ypr ∈ Z(H) is similar.
Corollary 3.3. H is finitely generated as a module over its center.
Proof. From Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, we see that H is generated over its center by

                                  xi yj sl ,       0 ≤ i, j ≤ pr − 1,             0 ≤ l ≤ r − 1.



Corollary 3.4. Every irreducible H-module is finite-dimensional over k.
Proof. Let V be an irreducible H-module. Then V is cyclic; that is, V = H/J, where J is a left ideal of H.
By corollary 3.3, it follows that V is a finitely generated Z(H)-module. Hence, there exists a maximal ideal
M ⊂ Z(H) such that V /M V 6= 0. But M V is a submodule of the irreducible H-module V , so M V = 0. Thus
the action of H in V factors through H/M H, which is a finite-dimensional algebra. So V = (H/M H)/L for
some left ideal L of H/M H. Hence V is finite-dimensional.
   Thus Schur’s lemma implies that central elements of H act as scalars in any irreducible H-module.
Lemma 3.5. One has
                                               [h, x] = x, [h, y] = −y, [h, s] = 0.


Proof. We have

                               [h, x] = hx − xh
                                                                   r−1
                                                                   X
                                        = xyx − x2 y +                    cj (1 − ε−j )−1 (xsj − sj x)
                                                                   j=1
                                                                r−1
                                                                X
                                        = x[y, x] + x                 cj s j
                                                                j=1
                                        = x[y, x] + x(1 − [y, x])
                                        = x.

Similarly, [h, y] = −y. Finally, sxy = ε−1 xsy = xys. From this it follows that s commutes with h.

                                                                      5
Lemma 3.6. Let V be a representation of H. Then, the sum of the common eigenspaces of h and s is a
subrepresentation.
Proof. Let v ∈ V be a common eigenvector of h and s, with eigenvalues λ and µ respectively. Then, using
lemma 3.5,

                                       h(xv)     =   xhv + xv = (λ + 1)(xv),
                                       h(yv) =       yhv − yv = (λ − 1)(yv),
                                       h(sv) =       shv = λ(sv),
                                       s(xv)     =   ε−1 xsv = ε−1 µ(xv),
                                       s(yv)     =   εysv = εµ(yv),
                                        s(sv) =      µ(sv).

Thus, xv, yv and sv are also common eigenvectors of h and s. The result follows.
Corollary 3.7. If V is an irreducible representation of H, then

                                                  V = ⊕β,m V [β, m],

where V [β, m] is the common eigenspace of h and s with eigenvalues β and εm .
Corollary 3.8. Let H be the subalgebra of H generated by Z(H), h and s. Then H is commutative.
Proof. Follows from lemma 3.5.
Lemma 3.9. One has xm yn sl ∈ H for all m, n, l such that pr divides m − n.
Proof. For all m ≥ 1, we have

                       xm ym   =    xm−1 (xy)ym−1
                               =    xm−1 (h + f0 (s))ym−1 for some f0 (s) ∈ k[s]
                               =    f1 (s)xm−1 ym−1 + xm−1 hym−1 for some f1 (s) ∈ k[s]
                               =    f1 (s)xm−1 ym−1 + xm−1 ym−1 h − (m − 1)xm−1 ym−1 .

Using induction, it follows that xm ym ∈ H for all m ≥ 0. Using lemma 3.2, we see that xm yn sl ∈ H whenever
pr divides m − n.
Corollary 3.10. Let V be an irreducible H-module. Then dim V [β, m] ≤ 1 for each β ∈ k, m ∈ Z/rZ.
Moreover, if V [β, m] 6= 0 and V [β ′ , m′ ] 6= 0, then β − β ′ is an element of the prime field Fp ⊂ k, and thus
dim V ≤ pr.
Proof. Let v ∈ V be nonzero. Since V is irreducible, we have Hv = V . By lemma 3.1, we know that V is
generated over k by
                                    xi yj sl v, 0 ≤ i, j, 0 ≤ l ≤ r − 1.
By lemma 3.2, it follows that V is generated over k by

                                   xi yj sl v,   0 ≤ i, j ≤ pr − 1, 0 ≤ l ≤ r − 1.

    Now suppose V [β, m] 6= 0, and let v ∈ V [β, m] be nonzero. Then xi yj sl v ∈ V [β + i − j, m − i + j] for
all i, j, l. This proves the second part of the corollary, and also implies that V [β, m] is generated by xi yi sl v
with 0 ≤ i ≤ pr − 1. Thus V [β, m] ⊂ Hv, by lemma 3.9. But it is easy to see that Hv ⊂ V [β, m]. Thus
Hv = V [β, m]. Since this is true for all nonzero v ∈ V [β, m], we conclude that V [β, m] is an irreducible
representation of H. Since H is commutative, we see that V [β, m] is one dimensional. This proves the first
part of the corollary.


                                                           6
Proof of proposition 2.3. Let V be an irreducible representation of H.
     Let v ∈ V [β, m] be nonzero. Then xi v ∈ V [β + i, m − i] for all i. By lemma 3.2, we know that
x , y act on V by multiplication by scalars a, b respectively. Assume a 6= 0. Then xpr v = av 6= 0, so
 pr pr

xi v 6= 0 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ pr − 1, and thus V [β + i, m − i] 6= 0 for 0 ≤ i ≤ pr − 1. Applying corollary 3.10,
and using the fact that p, r are relatively prime, we conclude that dim V = pr and dim V [β ′ , m′ ] = 1 for
β ′ = β, β + 1, . . . , β + (p − 1), 0 ≤ m′ ≤ r − 1. We may now assume that m = 0.
                def
    Now let vi = xi v for i = 0, 1, . . . , pr. In particular, v0 = v and vpr = av. Then the vi , 0 ≤ i ≤ pr − 1,
form a basis of V . We have vi ∈ V [β + i, −i], so svi = ε−i vi . For each i, yvi ∈ V [β + i − 1, −i + 1], so we let
yvi = µi vi−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ pr. Then, for 1 ≤ i ≤ pr, we have

                                (β + i)vi       =   hvi
                                                                                          
                                                                  r−1
                                                                  X

                                                                  j=1
                                                                                              
                                                                  r−1
                                                                  X
                                                =   µi −                cj (1 − ε−j )−1 ε−ij  vi ,
                                                                  j=1

so
                                                              r−1

which proves uniqueness. Now it is easy to check that Vβ,a,b = span{vi , 0 ≤ i ≤ pr − 1},

                                            xvi     =       vi+1 ,       0 ≤ i ≤ pr − 1
                                            yvi     =       µi vi−1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ pr
                                            svi     =       ε−i vi , 0 ≤ i ≤ pr
                                            vpr     =       av0

defines a representation of H. Furthermore, the representation is irreducible, since any nonzero subrepre-
sentation of Vβ,a,b would have dimension pr, by the arguments contained in this proof. We note that
                                                            pr
                                                                 !
                                                            Y

where f (z) = z p −z. It remains to show that Vβ,a,b ∼
                                                     = Vβ ′ ,a,b if and only if β −β ′ ∈ Fp . But if β −β ′ ∈ Fp , then
the common eigenvalues of h and s for Vβ,a,b and Vβ ′ ,a,b are the same, so Vβ,a,b ∼    = Vβ ′ ,a,b by the arguments
in this proof. If β − β ′ ∈
                          / Fp , then the common eigenvalues of h and s for Vβ,a,b and Vβ ′ ,a,b are different, so
Vβ,a,b and Vβ ′ a,b cannot be isomorphic.
    A similar argument works in the case a = 0, b 6= 0.

                                                                     7
Proof of proposition 2.5. Let V be an irreducible representation of H with xpr = ypr = 0. Let v be a common
eigenvector of h and s. Since xpr V = 0 and ypr V = 0, we can find minimal d, D such that xD v = yd v = 0.
Let
                            v−i = yi v, 1 ≤ i < d; v0 = v; vi = xi v, 1 ≤ i < D.
Since V is irreducible, we know that the vi form a basis of V and that xv−i 6= 0 for 1 ≤ i < d, yvi 6= 0 for
1 ≤ i < D. Thus, by scaling and relabeling, and using corollary 3.10, we may assume that V has a basis
v0 , v1 , . . . , vD−1 with

                                       xvi     = vi+1 ,       for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 2;
                                   xvD−1       = 0;
                                      yvi      = µi vi−1         for 1 ≤ i ≤ D − 1;
                                      yv0      = 0;
                                      svi      = εm−i vi           for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 1.

In order for this to be a representation, we need
                                                                                
                                                                      r−1
                                                                      X
                                      (yx − xy)vi == 1 −                   cj sj  vi .
                                                                      j=1


Writing µD = µ0 = 0, this gives
                                                   r−1
                                                   X
                              µi+1 − µi = 1 −            cj ε(m−i)j    for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 1.                    (3)
                                                   j=1

Adding up (3) for 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 gives
                                                          k−1
                                                          XX  r−1
                                             µk = k −               cj ε(m−i)j .
                                                          i=0 j=1

In particular,
                                                            D−1
                                                            XX  r−1
                                       0 = µD = D −                    cj ε(m−i)j .

As we saw earlier, in order for the representation to be irreducible, we need µk 6= 0 for 1 ≤ k ≤ D − 1, which
translates as
                                           k−1
                                           XX  r−1
                                  0 6= k −         cj ε(m−i)j , 1 ≤ k ≤ D − 1.

Corollary 3.11 (PBW for H). The elements

                                      xi yj sl ,       0 ≤ i, j,      0≤l ≤r−1

form a basis of H over k.
Proof. This follows because the elements xi yj sl act as linearly independent operators on ⊕β,a,b Vβ,a,b .

4     Proof of propositions 2.7 and 2.8
In this section, several proofs will be omitted because they are essentially identical to the corresponding
proofs in the previous section.
Lemma 4.1 (PBW for H′ , easy direction). The elements

                                        xi yj sl ,      0 ≤ i, j,        0≤l ≤r−1

span H′ over k.
Lemma 4.2. xr and yr belong to the center Z(H′ ) of H′ .
Proof. First, let us show that xr ∈ Z(H′ ). It is enough to show that [xr , y] = [xr , s] = 0. But xr s = εr sxr =
                                       Pr−1
sxr , so [xr , s] = 0. Now let g(s) = − j=1 cj sj . Then,

                             yxr   =   (yx)xr−1
                                   =   (xy + g(s))xr−1
                                   =   x(yx)xr−2 + g(s)xr−1
                                   =   ···
                                   =   xr y + g(s)xr−1 + xg(s)xr−2 + · · · + xr−1 g(s)
                                              r−1
                                              X
                                       xr y +     cj sj xr−1 + xsj xr−2 + · · · + xr−1 sj
                                                                                          
                                   =
                                                j=1
                                                r−1
                                                X
                                   =   xr y +         cj (1 + εj + · · · + εj(r−1) )sj xr−1
                                                j=1
                                        r
                                   =   x y,

since 1 + z + · · · + z r−1 = 0 whenever z 6= 1 is a r-th root of unity. Thus [y, xr ] = 0.
    This completes the proof that xr ∈ Z(H′ ). The proof that yr ∈ Z(H′ ) is similar.
Corollary 4.3. H′ is finitely generated as a module over its center.
Corollary 4.4. Every irreducible H′ -module is finite-dimensional over k.
    In particular, central elements of H′ act as scalars in its irrreducible representations.
Lemma 4.5. One has h ∈ Z(H′ ).
Proof. We have

                               [h, x] = hx − xh
                                                             r−1
                                                             X
                                       = xyx − x2 y +               cj (1 − ε−j )−1 (xsj − sj x)
                                                             j=1
                                                          r−1
                                                          X
                                       = x[y, x] + x            cj s j
                                                          j=1
                                       = x[y, x] + x(−[y, x])
                                       = 0.

Similarly, [h, y] = 0. Finally, sxy = ε−1 xsy = xys, so [h, s] = 0.
    Let H′ be the subalgebra of H′ generated by Z(H′ ) and s. Obviously, H′ is commutative.

                                                                9
Lemma 4.6. xm yn sl ∈ H′ for all m, n, l such that r divides m − n.
Proof. For all m ≥ 1, we have

                       xm ym    = xm−1 (xy)ym−1
                                = xm−1 (h + f0 (s))ym−1            for some f0 (s) ∈ k[s]
                                            m−1 m−1           m−1 m−1
                                = f1 (s)x         y     +x         y    h   for some f1 (s) ∈ k[s].

Using induction, it follows that xm ym ∈ H′ for all m ≥ 0. Using lemma 4.2, we see that xm yn sl ∈ H′
whenever r divides m − n.
     If V is an irreducible representation of H′ , then

                                                      V = ⊕m V [m],

where V [m] is the eigenspace of s with eigenvalue εm .
Corollary 4.7. Let V be an irreducible H′ -module. Then dim V [m] ≤ 1 for each m ∈ Z/rZ. Thus dim V ≤ r.


Proof. Let v ∈ V be nonzero. Since V is irreducible, we have H′ v = V . By lemma 4.1, we know that V is
generated over k by
                                    xi yj sl v, 0 ≤ i, j, 0 ≤ l ≤ r − 1.
By lemma 4.2, it follows that V is generated over k by

                                    xi yj sl v,   0 ≤ i, j ≤ r − 1, 0 ≤ l ≤ r − 1.

    Now suppose V [m] 6= 0, and let v ∈ V [m] be nonzero. Then xi yj sl v ∈ V [m − i + j] for all i, j, l. This
implies that V [m] is generated over k by xi yi sl v with 0 ≤ i ≤ r − 1. Thus V [m] ⊂ H′ v, by lemma 4.6. But it
is easy to see that H′ v ⊂ V [m]. Thus H′ v = V [m]. Since this is true for all nonzero v ∈ V [m], we conclude
that V [m] is an irreducible representation of H′ , hence one dimensional. This proves the corollary.
Proof of proposition 2.7. Let V be an irreducible representation of H′ .
     Let v ∈ V [m] be nonzero. Then xi v ∈ V [m − i] for all i. By lemmas 4.2 and 4.5, we know that xr , yr
and h act on V by multiplication by scalars, say a, b, β respectively. Assume a 6= 0. Then xr v = av 6= 0, so
xi v 6= 0 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ r − 1, and thus V [m − i] 6= 0 for 0 ≤ i ≤ r − 1. Applying corollary 4.7, we conclude
that dim V = r and dim V [m′ ] = 1 for 0 ≤ m′ ≤ r − 1. We may now assume that m = 0.
                  def
     Now let vi = xi v for i = 0, 1, . . . , r. In particular, v0 = v and vr = av. Then the vi , 0 ≤ i ≤ r − 1, form
a basis of V . We have vi ∈ V [−i], so svi = ε−i vi . For each i, yvi ∈ V [−i + 1], so we let yvi = µi vi−1 for
1 ≤ i ≤ r. Then, for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, we have

                                   βvi    = hvi
                                                                               

which proves uniqueness. Now it is easy to check that Vβ,a,b = span{vi , 0 ≤ i ≤ r − 1},

defines a representation of H′ . Furthermore, the representation is irreducible, since any nonzero subrepre-
sentation of Vβ,a,b would have dimension r, by the arguments contained in this proof. We note that
                                                             r
                                                                 !

Therefore,                                                                            

   A similar argument works in the case b 6= 0.
Proof of proposition 2.8. Let V be an irreducible representation of H′ with xr = yr = 0. Let v be an
eigenvector of s. Since xr V = 0 and yr V = 0, we can find minimal d, D such that xD v = yd v = 0. Let
                            v−i = yi v, 1 ≤ i < d;        v0 = v;         vi = xi v, 1 ≤ i < D.
Since V is irreducible, we know that the vi form a basis of V and that xv−i 6= 0 for 1 ≤ i < d, yvi 6= 0 for
1 ≤ i < D. Thus, by scaling and relabeling, and using corollary 4.7, we may assume that V has a basis
v0 , v1 , . . . , vD−1 with
                                        xvi     = vi+1 ,          for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 2;
                                  xvD−1         = 0;
                                     yvi        = µi vi−1          for 1 ≤ i ≤ D − 1;
                                      yv0       = 0;
                                      svi       = εm−i vi          for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 1.
In order for this to be a representation, we need
                                                                    r−1
                                                                    X
                                              (yx − xy)vi = −             cj sj vi .
                                                                    j=1

Writing µD = µ0 = 0, this gives
                                                 r−1
                                                 X
                              µi+1 − µi = −            cj ε(m−i)j      for 0 ≤ i ≤ D − 1.                (4)
                                                 j=1

Adding up (4) for 0 ≤ i ≤ t − 1 gives
                                                        k−1 X
                                                        X   r−1
                                              µk = −                cj ε(m−i)j .
                                                        i=0 j=1

In particular,
                                                           D−1
                                                           XX  r−1
                                         0 = µD = −                    cj ε(m−i)j .
                                                           i=0 j=1

As we saw earlier, in order for the representation to be irreducible, we need µk 6= 0 for 1 ≤ k ≤ D − 1, which
translates as
                                         k−1
                                         XX  r−1
                                    0 6=         cj ε(m−i)j , 1 ≤ k ≤ D − 1.
                                         i=0 j=1




Corollary 4.8 (PBW for H′ ). The elements

                                      xi yj sl ,   0 ≤ i, j,   0≤l ≤r−1

form a basis of H′ over k.
Proof. This follows because the elements xi yj sl act as linearly independent operators on ⊕β,a,b Vβ,a,b .
