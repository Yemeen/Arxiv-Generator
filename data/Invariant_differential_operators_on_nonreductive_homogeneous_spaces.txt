                                                  treatment of the general reductive case and the special nonreductive case of the space of

                                             1    Introduction
                                             Let G be a Lie group and H a closed subgroup. Let g and h denote the corresponding Lie
                                             algebras. Suppose that the coset space G/H is reductive, i.e., there is a complementary
                                             subspace m to h in g such that AdG (H)m ⊂ m. Let D(G/H) denote the algebra of G-
                                             invariant differential operators on G/H. The main facts about D(G/H) are summarized
                                             below (cf. HELGASON [3, Ch.III], [4, Cor. X.2.6, Theor. X.2.7], [6, §2]).
                                                 Let D(G) be the algebra of left invariant differential operators on G, DH (G) the subal-
                                             gebra of operators which are right invariant under H and S(g) the complexified symmetric
                                             algebra over g. Let λ: S(g) → D(G) denote the symmetrization mapping. I(m) denotes the
                                             set of AdG (H)-invariants in S(m). Then

                                                                          DH (G) = D(G)h ∩ DH (G) ⊕ λ(I(m)).                                    (1.1)

                                             Let π: G → G/H be the natural mapping. Let CH    ∞
                                                                                                (G) consist of the C ∞ -functions on G
                                             which are right invariant under H. Write f˜ := f ◦ π (f ∈ C ∞ (G/H)) and (Du f )∼ := uf˜
                                             (f ∈ C ∞ (G/H), u ∈ DH (G)). Then Du ∈ D(G/H).
                                             Theorem 1.1 The mapping u 7→ Du is an algebra homomorphism from DH (G) onto
                                             D(G/H) with kernel D(G)h ∩ DH (G). The mapping P 7→ Dλ(P ) : I(m) → D(G/H) is a linear
                                             bijection.

                                                                                              1
    Theorem 1.1. is of basic importance for the analysis on symmetric spaces. In particular,
it can be shown that D(G/H) is commutative if G/H is a pseudo-Riemannian symmetric
space which admits a relatively invariant measure. In its most general form this result was
proved by DUFLO [1] in an algebraic way. G. van Dijk kindly communicated a short analytic
proof of Duflo’s result to me (unpublished). In [1] DUFLO used generalizations of (1.1) and
Theorem 1.1 to the case of homogeneous line bundles over G/H. These can be proved by
only minor changes of Helgason’s original proofs.
    There exist nonreductive coset spaces G/H for which D(G/H) is still commutative. For
instance, let G be a connected real semisimple Lie group and let M and N be the usual
subgroups of G. Then G/MN is the space of horocycles and D(G/MN) is commutative. In
order to prove this, formula (1.1) and Theorem 1.1 have to be adapted to the nonreductive
case. While HELGASON [5, §4], [6, §3] has done this in an ad hoc way for the special coset
spaces under consideration, it is the purpose of the present note to give a more systematic
exposition of the theory of D(G/H) for a not necessarily reductive coset space.
    Furthermore, following Duflo, the theory will be developed for invariant differential op-
erators on homogeneous line bundles over G/H. As a final application we will characterize
D(G/H) for isotropic pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces G/H without a priori knowledge
that G/H is reductive. Throughout HELGASON [4] will be our standard reference.


2     Development of the general theory
Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra g. For X ∈ g define the vector field X̃ on G by
                                       d
                        (X̃f )(g) :=      f (g exp tX)|t=0 ,           f ∈ C ∞ (G), g ∈ G.           (2.1)
                                       dt
Then the mapping X 7→ X̃ is an isomorphism from g onto the Lie algebra of left invariant
vector fields on G. Throughout this section let X1 , . . . , Xn be a fixed basis of g.
     For a finite-dimensional real vector space V the symmetric algebra S(V ) is defined as
the algebra of all polynomials with complex coefficients on V ∗ , the dual of V . Let S m (V )
respectively Sm (V ) (m = 0, 1, 2, . . . ) denote the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree
m on V ∗ , respectively of polynomials of degree ≤ m on V ∗ . Thus S m (G) is spanned by the
monomials Xi1 Xi2 . . . Xim (i1 , . . . , im ∈ {1, . . . , n}).
     Let D(G) be the algebra of left invariant differential operators on G with complex coef-
ficients. For P ∈ S(g) define an operator λ(P ) on C ∞ (G) by
                                                
                                 ∂            ∂                                      
           (λ(P )f )(g) := P          ,···,         f (g exp(t1 X1 + · · · + tn Xn ))              , (2.2)
                                                                                     
                               ∂t1           ∂tn                                      t1 =···=tn =0

where
                                                          ∂m
                                           
                             ∂         ∂
                    P           ,···,           :=                      for P = Xi1 · · · Xim .

It is proved in [4, Prop. II.1.9 and p. 392] that:
Proposition 2.1 The mapping P 7→ λ(P ) is a linear bijection from S(g) onto D(G). It
satisfies
                             λ(Y m ) = Ỹ m , Y ∈ g;                           (2.3)

                                                            2
                                          1 X
                      λ(Y1 . . . Ym ) =          Ỹσ(1) . . . Ỹσ(m) ,        Y1 , . . . , Ym ∈ g.        (2.4)
                                          m! σ∈S
                                                  m

The definition of λ is independent of the choice of the basis of g.

    The mapping λ is called symmetrization. The Lie algebra g is embedded as a subspace
of D(G) under the mapping X → X̃. Any homomorphism from g to g uniquely extends to
a homomorphism from D(G) to D(G) and any linear mapping from g to g uniquely extends
to a homorphism from S(g) to S(g). In particular, for g ∈ G, the automorphism Ad(g) of g
uniquely extends to automorphisms of both S(g) and D(G) and

                            λ(Ad(g)P ) = Ad(g)λ(P ),                    P ∈ S(g), g ∈ G.                  (2.5)

For g, g1 ∈ G, f ∈ C ∞ (G), D ∈ D(G) write
                                                                                   −1 )
                           f R(g) (g1 ) := f (g1 g);         D R(g) f := (Df R(g          )R(g) .

Then
                                                      −1 )
                               Ad(g)D = D R(g                ,       D ∈ D(G), g ∈ G.                     (2.6)
    Let H be a closed subgroup of G and let h be the corresponding subalgebra. Let m
be a subspace of g complementary to h. Let X1 , . . . , Xr be a basis of m and Xr+1 , . . . , Xn
a basis of h. Let χ be a character of H, i.e. a continuous homomorphism from H to the
multiplicative group C\{0}. Throughout this section, H, m, the basis and χ will be assumed
fixed.
    Let π: G → G/H be the canonical mapping. Write 0 := π(e). Let
                  ∞
                 CH,χ (G) := {f ∈ C ∞ (G) | f (gh) = f (g)χ(h−1 ), g ∈ G, h ∈ H}.                         (2.7)

    Sometimes we will assume that χ has an extension to a character on G. This assumption
clearly holds if χ ≡ 1 on H, but it does not hold for general H and χ. For instance, if
G = SU(2) or SL(2, R) and H = SO(2) then nontrivial characters on H do not extend to
characters on G.
    If χ extends to a character on G then we define a linear bijection f 7→ f˜: C ∞ (G/H) →
CH,χ (G) by
  ∞

                              f˜(g) := f (π(g))χ(g −1), g ∈ G.                          (2.8)


Lemma 2.2 Let P ∈ S(m). If λ(P )f = 0 for all f ∈ CH,χ
                                                   ∞
                                                       (G) then P = 0.

Proof For each f ∈ C ∞ (G/H) we can find F ∈ CH,χ
                                              ∞
                                                  (G) such that

                    F (exp(t1 X1 + · · · + tr Xr )) = f (exp(t1 X1 + · · · + tr Xr ) · 0)

for (t1 , . . . , tr ) in some neighbourhood of (0, . . . , 0). Hence

                                                                 3
for all f ∈ C ∞ (G/H), so P = 0.                                                                  ✷

   Let the differential of χ also be denoted by χ. Let hC be the complexification of h. Let

                             hχ := {X + χ(X) | X ∈ hC } ⊂ D(G).                               (2.9)

Clearly, Df = 0 if f ∈ CH,χ
                         ∞
                            (G) and D ∈ hχ . Let D(G)hχ be the linear span of all vw with
v ∈ D(G), w ∈ hχ . Observe that, by Proposition 2.1, Ỹ1 . . . Ỹm ∈ λ(Sm (g)) for Y1 , . . . , Ym ∈
g. The following proposition was proved in [4, Lemma X.2.5] for χ ≡ 1.
Proposition 2.3 There are the direct sum decompositions

                             λ(Sm (g)) = λ(Sm−1 (g))hχ ⊕ λ(Sm (m))                           (2.10)

and
                                  D(G) = D(G)hχ ⊕ λ(S(m)).                                   (2.11)

Proof First we prove by complete induction with respect to m that

                            λ(Sm (g)) ⊂ λ(Sm−1 (g))hχ + λ(Sm (m)).

This clearly holds for m = 0. Suppose it is true for m < d. Let

                             P = X1d1 · · · Xndn ,       d1 + · · · + dn = d.

If dr+1 · · · + dn = 0, then P ∈ Sd (m), so λ(P ) ∈ λ(Sd (m)). If dr+1 + · · · + dn > 0 then, by
(2.4), λ(P ) is a linear combination of certain elements Ỹ1 · · · Ỹd with Yi ∈ h for at least one
i, so
                 λ(P ) ∈ λ(Sd−1 (g))hC + λ(Sd−1 (g)) ⊂ λ(Sd−1 (g))hχ + λ(Sd−1 (g)).
Now apply the induction hypothesis. This yields (2.10) and (2.11) (use Proposition 2.1)
except for the directness.
   To prove the directness of the sum (2.11), suppose that P ∈ S(m) and λ(P ) ∈ D(G)hχ .
Then λ(P )f = 0 for all f ∈ CH,χ

                                 (G), so P = 0 by Lemma 2.2.                        ✷
Lemma 2.4 Let D ∈ D(G). Then Df = 0 for all f ∈ CH,χ

Proof Apply Proposition 2.3 and Lemma 2.2.                                                        ✷

   Let us define

             DH,χ,mod (G) := {D ∈ D(G) | Ad(h)D − D ∈ D(G)hχ for all h ∈ H}.                 (2.12)

This definition is motivated by the following lemma.

                              (G), h ∈ H, then (D R(h) − D)f = (Ad(h)D − D)f = 0, so
combination with (⋆) yields (Df )R(h) = χ(h−1 )Df , i.e., Df ∈ CH,χ
                                                                ∞
                                                                    (G). Conversely, assume
                                         R(h)
(ii). If f ∈ CH,χ (G), h ∈ H, then (Df )
               ∞
                                              = χ(h )Df , so combination with (⋆) yields
                                                     −1
    R(h)                                    R(h)
(D       − D)f = 0. Hence Ad(h)D − D = D         − D ∈ D(G)hχ by Lemma 2.4.               ✷

   From the preceding results the following theorem is now obvious.

Theorem 2.6

 (a) DH,χ,mod(G) is a subalgebra of D(G).

 (b) D(G)hχ is a two-sided ideal in DH,χ,mod (G).

 (c) There is the direct sum decomposition.

                           DH,χ,mod (G) = D(G)hχ ⊕ λ(S(m)) ∩ DH,χ,mod(G).                  (2.13)

 (d) Define the mappings A and B by
                 A                       B
              u 7−→ u(mod D(G)hχ ) 7−→ u|C ∞                :
                                                  H,χ (G)
                                                                      
                                         A                       χ   B
             λ(S(m)) ∩ DH,χ,mod (G) −→ DH,χ,mod (G)/D(G)h −→ DH,χ,mod                 .
                                                                      
                                                                               ∞ (G)
                                                                              CH,χ


       Then A is a linear bijection and B is an algebra isomorphism onto.

   Define the mapping σ: g → m by

                               σ(X + Y ) := X,       X ∈ m, Y ∈ h.                         (2.14)

Consider S(m) as a subalgebra of S(g). Thus, if P ∈ S(m) and h ∈ H, then Ad(h)P ∈ S(g)
and σ◦Ad(h)P ∈ S(m) are well-defined. By an application of (2.4) we see that, if Q ∈ Sm (g),
then
                          λ(σQ − Q) ∈ λ(Sm−1 (g)) + D(G)hχ .                          (2.15)
Define the algebra

                     Imod (m) := {P ∈ S(m) | σ ◦ Ad(h)P = P for all h ∈ H}.                (2.16)



Lemma 2.7 Let P ∈ S(m) such that λ(P ) ∈ DH,χ,mod (G). Write P = P m + Pm−1 , where
P m ∈ S m (m), Pm−1 ∈ Sm−1 (m). Then P m ∈ Imod (m).



                                                 5
Proof λ(Ad(h)P − P ) ∈ D(G)hχ by (2.12). Hence

                           λ(Ad(h)P m − P m ) ∈ λ(Sm−1 (g)) + D(G)hχ .

So
          λ(σ ◦ Ad(h)P m − P m ) ∈ λ(Sm−1 (g)) + D(G)hχ ⊂ λ(Sm−1 (m)) + D(G)hχ ,
where we used (2.16) and (2.10). By directness of the decomposition (2.10):

                                    σ ◦ Ad(h)P m − P m ∈ Sm−1 (m).

Hence σ ◦ Ad(h)P m − P m , being homogeneous of degree m, is the zero polynomial.         ✷

Proposition 2.8 If λ(Imod (m)) ⊂ DH,χ,mod (G) then

                                λ(Imod (m)) = λ(S(m)) ∩ DH,χ,mod(G)

and the mapping

                                                                            CH,χ


is a linear bijection.

Proof Use complete induction with respect to the degree of P ∈ S(m) in order to prove
that P ∈ Imod (m) if λ(P ) ∈ DH,χ,mod (G) (apply Lemma 2.7). The second implication in the
proposition follows from Theorem 2.6(d).                                                ✷

   Suppose for the moment that χ extends to a character on g and remember the mapping
f → f˜ defined by (2.8). For u ∈ DH,χ,mod (G) define an operator Du acting on C ∞ (G/H) by

                                    (Du f )∼ := uf˜,       f ∈ C ∞ (G/H).              (2.17)

Then supp(Du f ) ⊂ supp(f ), hence, by Peetre’s theorem (cf. for instance NARASIMHAN
[7, §3.3]), Du is a differential operator on G/H. One easily shows that Du ∈ D(G/H), the
space of G-invariant differential operators on G/H.

Theorem 2.9 Suppose that χ extends to a character on G. Then the mapping
                                              
                           C                           C

is an algebraic isomorphism onto.

Proof Clearly, C is an isomorphism into. In order to prove the surjectivity let D ∈
D(G/H). Then there is a polynomial P ∈ S(m) such that
                                        
                            ∂         ∂

                           ∂t1       ∂tr                                        t1 =···=tr =0

for all f ∈ C ∞ (G/H) and for g = e. By the G-invariance of D this formula holds for all
g ∈ G. By (2.8) and (2.2) this becomes

                  χ(Df )∼ = λ(P )(χf˜),   i.e., (Df )∼ = (χ−1 λ(P ) ◦ χ)(f˜).

Clearly, χ−1 λ(P ) ◦ χ ∈ D(G) and, by Lemma 2.5, we have χ−1 λ(P ) ◦ χ ∈ DH,χmod (G). Thus,
by (2.17), D = Dχ−1 λ(P )◦χ .                                                            ✷

   Suppose now that the coset space G/H is reductive, i.e., m can be chosen such that
Ad(h)m ⊂ m for all h ∈ H. From now on assume that m is chosen in this way. Let

                  DH (G) := {D ∈ D(G) | Ad(h)D = D for all h ∈ H},                   (2.18)
                   I(m) := {P ∈ S(m) | Ad(h)P = P for all h ∈ H}.                    (2.19)

Then
                        λ(S(m)) ∩ DH,χ,mod(G) = λ(I(m)) ⊂ DH (G).
Hence (2.13) becomes
                             DH,χ,mod (G) = D(G)hχ ⊕ λ(I(m)).                        (2.20)
We obtain from Theorems 2.6 and 2.9:

Theorem 2.10 Let G/H be reductive. Then:

 (a) DH (G) is a subalgebra of D(G).

 (b) D(G)hχ ∩ DH (G) is a two-sided ideal in DH (G).

 (c) There is a direct sum decomposition

                              DH (G) = D(G)hχ ∩ DH (G) ⊕ λ(I(m)).                    (2.21)

 (d) Define the mappings A, B and C (Conly if χ extends to a character on G) by

       Then A is a linear bijection and B and C are algebra isomorphisms onto.

   The case χ ≡ 1 of Theorem 2.10 can be found in HELGASON [4, Cor. X.2.6 and Theor.
X.2.7]. See DUFLO [1] for the general case.

3     Application to D(G/N ) and D(G/M N )
Let G be a connected noncompact real semisimple Lie group. We remember some of the
structure theory of G (cf. [3. Ch.VI]):
g0 : Lie algebra of G.
g : complexification of g0 .
θ : Cartan involution of g0 , extended to automorphism of g.
g0 = k0 + p0 : corresponding Cartan decomposition of g0 .
hp0 : mamximal abelian subspace of p0 , A the coresponding analytic subgroup.
h0 : maximal abelian subalgebra of g0 extending hp0 .
hk0 := h0 ∩ k0 , hk its complexification
h : complexification of h0 ; this is a Cartan subalgebra of g.
∆ : set of roots of g with respect to h; the roots are real on ihk0 + hp0 .
Introduce compatible orderings on h∗p0 and (ihk0 + hp0 )∗ .
∆+ : set of positive roots.
P+ : set of positive roots not vanishing on hp0 .
P− : set of positive roots vanishing on hp0 .
gα :Proot space in g of α ∈ ∆.
n : α∈P+ gα .
n0 := n ∩ g0 .
N : analytic subgroup of G corresponding to n0 .
M : centralizer of hp0 in G, M0 its identity component.
m0 : Lie algebra of M.
m : complexification of m0 ; then
                                              X
                                  m = hk +        (gα + g−α ).                     (3.1)
                                             α∈P−



Proposition 3.1 The coset spaces G/MN and G/N are not reductive.

Proof Suppose that G/MN is reductive. Then there is an adg(m + n)-invariant subspace r
of g complementary to m + n. Let α ∈ P+ and let X be a nonzero element of gα . For H ∈ h
write H = WH + YH + ZH with WH ∈ r, YH ∈ m, ZH ∈ n. Then, for each H ∈ h:

                                α(H)X = [WH + YH + ZH , X]

so
                    α(H)X − [YH , X] − [ZH , X] = [WH , X] ∈ r ∩ (m + n),
so
                                 [YH , X] + [ZH , X] = α(H)X.
It follows from (3.1) that                               X
                                 [YH , X] + [ZH , X] ∈          gβ .
                                                         β∈∆
                                                         β6=α



                                               8
Hence α(H)X = 0 for all H ∈ h, so α = 0. This is a contradiction.
    In the case G/N the proof is almost the same: take r adg(n)-invariant and complementary
to n and YH = 0.                                                                         ✷
   HELGASON [5, p. 676] states without proof that G/MN is not in general reductive.
   Let l0 be the orthoplement of m0 in k0 with respect to the Killing form on g0 . In order
to apply Proposition 2.8 and Theorem 2.9 to D(G/MN) and D(G/N) we take l0 + hp0
respectively k0 + hp0 as complementary subspaces of m0 + n0 respectively n0 in g0 . Now we
have
                             Imod (l0 + hp0 ) = S(hp0 ),                              (3.2)
                             Imod (k0 + hp0 ) = S(m0 + hp0 ).                         (3.3)
(3.2) is proved in HELGASON [5. Lemma 4.2] and by only slight modifications in this proof,
(3.3) is obtained. It follows from Lemma 2.5 that
                                λ(S(hp0 )) ⊂ DM N,1,mod (G)
and
                              λ(S(m0 + hp0 )) ⊂ DN,1,mod (G),
since M centralizes hp0 and m0 + hp0 normalizes n0 . Consider D(A) and D(M0 A) as sub-
algebras of D(G). Then D(A) ⊂ DM N,1,mod (G) and D(M0 A) ⊂ DN,1,mod (G). It follows by
application of Proposition 2.8 and Theorem 2.9 that:
Theorem 3.2 The mapping u 7→ Du (cf. (2.17)) is an algebra isomorphism from D(A) onto
D(G/MN) and from D(M0 A) onto D(G/N). In particular, D(G/MN) is a commutative
algebra.
    The statements about D(G/MN) are in HELGASON [5, Theorem 4.1]. FARAUT [2,
p. 393] observes that Helgason’s result can be extended to the context of pseudo-Riemannian
symmetric spaces.
    A special case of Theorem 6.2 can be formulated in the situation that G is a connected
complex semisimple Lie group. Let g be its (complex) Lie algebra and put:
u : compact real form of g.
a : maximal abelian subalgebra of u.
h := a + ia; this is Cartan subalgebra of g.
∆ : set of roots of g with respect to h.
∆+ : set of positive roots with respect to some ordering.
gα : root
     P spaceα of α ∈ ∆.
n := α∈∆+ g , N the corresponding analytic subgroup.
gR := g considered as real Lie algebra.
hR := h considered as real subalgebra.
Then gR = u + ia + n is an Iwasawa decomposition for gR (cf. [4, Theorem VI.6.3]) and a is
the centralizer of ia in u. Hence we obtain from Theorem 3.2:
Theorem 3.3 The mapping P 7→ Dλ(P ) is an algebra isomorphism from S(hR ) onto
D(G/N). In particular, D(G/N) is commutative.
   This theorem was proved by HELGASON [6, Lemma 3.3] without use of Theorem 3.2.

4     Application to isotropic spaces
We preserve the notation and conventions of Section 2. First we prove an extension of [4,
Cor. X.2.8] to the case that G/H is not necessarily reductive. In the following, A and B are
as in Theorem 2.6(d).

Lemma 4.1 If the algebra Imod (m) is generated by P1 , . . . , Pl and if there are Q1 , . . . , Ql ∈
Sm such that degree(Pi − Qi ) < degree Pi and λ(Qi ) ∈ DH,χ,mod (G) then the algebra
                                              
                                     DH,χ,mod ∞
                                              
                                                     CH,χ (G)


is generated by BAλ(Q1 ), . . . , BAλ(Ql ).

Proof We prove by complete induction with respect to m that, for each P ∈ Sm (m)
with λ(P ) ∈ DH,χ,mod(G), BAλ(P ) depends polynomially on BAλ(Q1 ), . . . , BAλ(Ql ). In
view of Theorem 2.6 this will prove the lemma. Suppose the above property holds up to
m − 1. Let P ∈ Sm (m) such that λ(P ) ∈ DH,χ,mod(G). By using Lemma 2.7 we find that
P = Π(P1 , . . . , Pl ) (mod Sm−1 (m)) for some polynomial Π in l indeterminates. Hence,
P = Π(Q1 , . . . , Ql ) (mod Sm−1 (m)),

                 λ(P ) = λ(Π(Q1 , . . . , Ql )) (mod λ(Sm−1 (m)))
                       = Π(λ(Q1 ), . . . , λ(Ql )) (mod λ(Sm−1 (g))),
                 λ(P ) − Π(λ(Q1 ), . . . , λ(Ql )) ∈ λ(Sm−1 (g)) ∩ DH,χ,mod (G).

By Theorem 2.6 and formula (2.10) we have

                      BAλ(P ) − Π(BAλ(Q1 ), . . . , BAλ(Ql )) = BAλ(P ′)

for some P ′ ∈ Sm−1 (m) such that λ(P ′ ) ∈ DH,χ,mod (G). Now apply the induction hypothesis.
                                                                                           ✷
   Let τ denote the action of G on G/H. Its differential dτ yields an action of H on the
tangent space (G/H)0 to G/H at 0.

Theorem 4.2 Suppose there is a nondegenerate dτ (H)-invariant bilinear form h·, ·i on
(G/H)0 of signature (r1 , r2 ) (r1 + r2 = r, r1 ≥ r2 ) such that, for each λ > 0, dτ (H)
acts transitively on {X ∈ (G/H)0 | hX, Xi = λ} (or on the connected components of these
hyperbolas if r1 = r2 = 1). Let ∆ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on G/H coresponding
to the G-invariant pseudo-Riemannian structure on G/H associated with h·, ·i. Then the
algebra D(G/H) is generated by ∆, and hence commutative.

Proof Choose a complementary subspace m to h in g. The mapping dπ identifies the H-
spaces m (under σ ◦ AdG (H)) and (G/H)0 (under dτ (H)) with each other. Transplant the
form h·, ·i to m and choose an orthonormal basis X1 , . . . , Xr of m: hXi , Xj i = εP
                                                                                     i δij , εi = 1
or −1 for i ≤ r1 or > r1 , respectively. Then the algebra Imod (m) is generated by ru=1 εi Xi2 .


                                                10
It follows from the proof of Theorem 2.9 that ∆ = Dλ(P ) with P ∈ S(m) of degree 2 such
that λ(P ) ∈ DH,1,mod (G). Thus, by Lemma 2.7, we get
                                      r
                                      X
                               P =c         εi Xi2   (mod S1 (m))
                                      i=1

with c 6= 0. Now apply Lemma 4.1 and Theorem 2.9.                                                  ✷
    Theorem 4.2 extends [4, Prop. X.2.10], where the case is considered that G/H is a
Riemannian symmetric space of rank 1. A pseudo-Riemannian manifold M is called isotropic
if for each x ∈ M and for tangent vectors X, Y 6= 0 at x with hX, Xi = hY, Y i there is
an isometry of M fixing x which sends X to Y . Connected isotropic spaces can be written
as homogeneous spaces G/H satisfying the conditions of Theorem 4.2 with G being the
full isometry group (cf. WOLF [8, Lemma 11.6.6]). It follows from Wolf’s classification
[8, Theorem 12.4.5] that such spaces are symmetric and reductive. However, our proof of
Theorem 4.2 does not use this fact.
