                                            Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. (This will be
                                            the case through out the paper, except Appendix B, where all results of §2
                                            are extended to positive characteristic.) Let F be an algebraically closed
                                            extension of k of transcendence degree n, 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞, and let G = GF/k be
                                            the group of automorphisms over k of the field F . Let the set of subgroups

Uk(x) := Aut(F/k(x)) for all x ∈ F be a base of neighbourhoods of the
identity in G.
    This paper arose from an attempt to (i) compare properties of various
“geometric” categories with properties of various categories of smooth (i.e.,
with open stabilizers) representations of G, and (ii) to find analogues for
the group G of familiar results of representation theory of p-adic groups.
    The group G is very big, in particular, it contains the groups Aut(L/k) as
its sub-quotients for all sub-extensions k ⊂ L ⊂ F . All reduced irreducible
algebraic groups of dimension ≤ n, the group PGLn+1 k, some adelic groups
are subgroups of groups of type Aut(L/k).
    One of the main results of the paper (Theorem 2.9) is the simplicity (in
topological sense) of the group G in the case n = ∞, and of the subgroup
G◦ of G generated by its compact subgroups in general. This is also true in
positive characteristic, and implies (Corollary 2.11) that in the case n = ∞
any non-trivial continuous representation of G is faithful; and in the case
n < ∞ any non-faithful continuous representation of G factors through a
discrete quotient G/G◦ of G. Another consequence is that G◦ (and G if
n = ∞) admits no smooth representations of finite degree.
    Unfortunately, I do not know much about the group G/G◦ , and this is
one of the reasons why I prefer to work in the “stable” case n = ∞.
    There is an evident link between representations of G and some geo-
metric objects. Namely, for a scheme X over k there is a natural smooth
G-action on the group of cycles on XF := X ×k F . Conversely, any smooth
cyclic G-module is a quotient of the G-module of “generic” 0-cycles on XF
for an appropriate irreducible variety X of dimension ≤ n over k. The Hecke
algebras, playing an important rôle in representation theory of locally com-
pact groups, become in our case algebras of non-degenerate correspondences
on certain varieties over k, cf. §3, p.15.
    In some cases one can identify the groups of morphisms between geomet-
ric objects with the groups of morphisms between corresponding G-modules
(cf. Propositions 3.6 and 4.3, and Corollary 3.7).
    (Homological) Grothendieck motives are pairs (X, π) consisting of a
smooth projective variety
                       L       X over k with irreducible components Xj and a
projector π = π 2 ∈ j Adim Xj (Xj ×k Xj ) in the algebra of correspondences
on X modulo an adequate equivalence
                                 L          relation. The morphisms are defined
by Hom((X ′ , π ′ ), (X, π)) = i,j πj · Adim Xj (Xj ×k Xi′ ) · πi′ . The category of
Grothendieck motives carries an additive and a tensor structures:
                M                a
   (X ′ , π ′ )   (X, π) := (X ′   X, π ′ ⊕ π),
                                     (X ′ , π ′ ) ⊗ (X, π) := (X ′ ×k X, π ′ ×k π).

A primitive q-motive is a pair (X, π) as above with dim X = q and π ·
Aq (X ×k Y × P1 ) = 0 for any smooth projective variety Y over k with
dim Y < q. For instance, the category of the primitive 1-motives modulo
numerical equivalence is equivalent to the category of abelian varieties over
k with morphisms tensored with Q. If the adequate equivalence relation is
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of ﬁelds                3


numerical equivalence, it follows from a result of Jannsen [Jan] that any
Grothendieck
L               motive is semi-simple and admits “primitive” decomposition
               ⊗i
   i,j M ij ⊗ L   , where Mij is a primitive j-motive and L = (P1 , P1 × {0})
(see Remark on p.27).
    The major part of the results of Section 3 can be summarized as follows.


Theorem 1.1. 1. If n = ∞ there is a fully faithful functor B• :
                                                               
      motives over k modulo    B•   graded semi-simple admissible
                              −→                                    .
      numerical equivalence            G-modules of finite type
   The grading corresponds to powers of the motive L in the “primitive”
   decomposition above.
2. For any 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞ and each q ≥ 0 there is a functor Bq , fully faithful
   if q ≤ n:
                                                                    

         primitive q-motives over k   B q
                                      −→ G-modules of finite type .
       modulo numerical equivalence                                 
                                                 and of level q

   (One says that a semi-simple admissible G-module W is of level q if
   Nq W = W and Nq−1 W = 0 for the filtration N• defined in the beginning
   of §6.1.)
3. If n < ∞ then the G-module Bn (M ) carries a bilinear symmetric non-
   degenerate G-equivariant form with values in an oriented G-module Q(χ)
   of degree 1, where M = (X, ∆k(X) ) is the maximal primitive n-submotive
   of the motive (X, ∆X ) and dim X = n.
   This form is definite if, for (n − 1)-cycles on 2n-dimensional complex
   varieties, numerical equivalence coincides with homological (e.g., for n ≤
   2), and therefore, Bn factors through the subcategory of “polarizable” G-
   modules (i.e., carrying a positive form as above).
This is a direct consequence of Corollary 3.7 and Propositions 3.8, 3.19,
3.21. Roughly speaking, the functors Bq and B• = ⊕gradedj    B[j] are defined
as spaces of 0-cycles defined over F modulo “numerical equivalence over k”.
Details are in §3.2, p.26, where it is shown that they are pro-representable.
It follows from Proposition 3.17 that Bq ((X, π)) depends only on the bira-
tional class of X. Moreover, the functor B1 of Theorem 1.1(2) is an equiv-
alence of categories when n = ∞, cf. §6.2, and by Corollary 4.4, the com-
position of the functor B1 with the forgetful functor to the category of
G◦ -modules is also fully faithful.

Conjecture 1.2. The functor B• is an equivalence of categories. Equivalently,
for any q ≥ 0 the functor Bq is an equivalence of categories if n = ∞.

   The section is concluded by showing (Corollary 3.24) that any polariz-
able representation (in the sense of Theorem 1.1(3)) is infinite-dimensional.
This is deduced from a vanishing result (Corollary 3.23) for representations
4                                                                 M.Rovinsky


of the Hecke algebra of the subgroup Gal(F/L(x)), induced by polarizable
representations of G (here L is a subextension of k in F of finite type and
x an element of F transcendental over L with F = L(x)) corresponding to
the triviality of the primitive n-submotives of (Y × P1 , π), where dim Y < n.
    Corollary 3.23 suggests also that the category of the primitive n-motives
is not too far from the category of the polarizable G-modules (at least, if
n ≤ 2). However, as the twists of the polarizables by order-two characters
of G are again polarizable, but not “motivic” (cf. Corollary 4.5), one should
impose some additional conditions. One of such conditions could be the
“stability” in the sense that for any algebraically closed extension F ′ of
F any “motivic” representation is isomorphic to W GF ′ /F for some smooth
GF ′ /k -module W ; another one could be the “arithmeticity” in the sense that
any “motivic” representation admits an extension W by a module of lower
level (in the sense of filtration N• ) with W isomorphic to the restriction to
G ⊆ GF/k′ of a smooth GF/k′ -module for a subfield k ′ ⊆ k of finite type
over Q...
    By analogy with the Langlands correspondences, one can call the G-
modules in the image of Bn cuspidal. For the groups GL over a local non-
archimedian field there are several equivalent definitions of quasicuspidal
representations. One of them: all matrix coefficients (the functions hσw, wi,
                                                                           e
cf. p.34) are compactly supported modulo the center. However, it is shown in
§4.3 that there are no such representations for any subgroup of G containing
G◦ . This is a consequence of the irreducibility of the smooth G-modules F/k
and F × /k × , considered as modules over the subgroup G◦ of G, and their
faithfulness as modules over the algebra of compactly supported measures
on G shown in §4.1.
    In §5.1, in the case n = ∞, various analogues of Hilbert Theorem 90
are verified. In particular, it is shown in Proposition 5.4, that any G-torsor
under A(F ) is trivial for any algebraic group A over k. There exist, however,
interesting examples of torsors in the case n < ∞.
    If n = ∞ and A is an irreducible commutative algebraic group over k,
we show in Corollary 5.2 that Ext1SmG (A(F )/A(k), Q) = Hom(A(k), Q),
where SmG is the category of smooth G-modules. If A is an abelian variety
then A(F )/A(k) = B1 (A∨ ) (here A∨ := Pic◦ A is the dual abelian variety),
so this should correspond to the identity Ext1MMk (Q(0), H1 (A)) = A(k)Q
in the category of mixed motives over k. If A = Gm then the identity
Ext1MMk (Q(0), Q(1)) = k × ⊗ Q suggests that the non-admissible G-module
F × /k × admits a motivic interpretation analogous to Q(1).
    The purpose of §6 is to introduce an abelian category IG of “homotopy
invariant” representations having some properties of the Chow groups. If
n = ∞ then it contains all admissible G-modules (Proposition 6.4), it is
a Serre subcategory in SmG (Proposition 6.15), and it is closed under the
inner Hom functor on SmG (Proposition 6.26). There are no smooth pro-
jective representations of G, if n = ∞ (cf. Remark on p.41). However, it is
shown in Corollary 6.11 that IG has enough projective objects. Namely, the
                                                                    I
inclusion functor IG −→ SmG admits the left adjoint SmG −→ IG , and
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of ﬁelds                     5


to any subextension L of finite type one associates the projective object
CL := IQ[G/GF/L ] of IG . For any smooth proper model X of L/k there
is a natural surjection CL −→ CH0 (X ×k F )Q . One can expect (Conjec-
ture 6.16) that this is an isomorphism if n = ∞. If tr.deg(L/k) = 1 this is
Corollary 6.21.
    At the end of §6.2, p.50, a functorial decreasing filtration F • on objects of
IG is introduced. It is likely that in the case of G-modules of type CH0 (XF )Q
for smooth proper X over k it is the motivic filtration. This agrees with
Corollary 6.24: Ck(X) ∼  = Q ⊕ AlbX(F )Q ⊕ F 2 Ck(X) .
    If n = ∞ then Conjecture 6.16, the semi-simplicity conjecture and
Bloch–Beilinson filtration conjecture would imply (i) Conjecture 1.2, (ii)
that any irreducible object of IG is admissible, and (iii) that the G-modules
grjN W are semi-simple for any object W of IG (the latter is Conjecture 6.9).
Indeed, for some collection of subfields L ⊂ F of finite type and of tran-
                                                                               ξ
scendence degree j over k there is a surjective morphism ⊕L Q[G/GF/L ] −→
grjN W , which factors through ⊕L grjN CL , cf. Proposition 6.8. If for a smooth
proper model Y[L] of L/k one has CL = CH0 (Y[L] ×k F )Q then grjN CL =
CH j (L ⊗k F )Q , so ξ factors through ⊕L CH j (L ⊗k F )Q . One can deduce
from the semi-simplicity conjecture and the filtration conjecture (cf. [B]
§1.4, or [R] Prop.1.1.1)1 that CH j (L ⊗k F )Q coincides with Bj (M ), where
M is the maximal primitive j-submotive of the motive (Y[L] , ∆Y[L] ). Finally,
by semi-simplicity, there are projectors πL and an isomorphism
                                             ∼
                         ⊕L Bj ((Y[L] , πL )) −→ grjN W.

This shows (iii), and taking irreducible W (which coincides with grjN W for
some j) we get also (i) and (ii).
    It is also conjectured2 that the level filtration N• is strictly compatible
with the morphisms in IG (cf. Corollary 6.10), so that, in particular, exten-
sions of G-modules in IG of lower level by irreducible G-modules in IG of
higher level are (canonically) split. Obviously, this is motivated by Hodge
theory, and one would like to find a category bigger than IG and modify
the filtration to keep this property.
    However, if we want to consider G-modules like F × /k × , the notion of
weight should be more subtle. Usually, for a pair W1 , W2 of irreducible
objects, W1 is of higher weight if Ext1 (W1 , W2 ) 6= 0, so this would give
weight(Q) <weight(F × /k × ) <weight(A(F )/A(k)), cf. §5.1, for any abelian
variety A over k, which is not good if A(F )/A(k) corresponds to H1 (A).
    If n = ∞, the category IG carries a tensor structure compatible with
the inner Hom, but its associativity depends on Conjecture 6.16.
    If n < ∞ then the category of smooth G-modules has sufficiently many
projective objects. Namely, any smooth G-module is a quotient of a direct

   where it is shown that under above assumptions the localization surjection
CH ∗ (Y[L] ×k Y[L′ ] ) −→ CH ∗ (L ⊗k L′ )Q kills the numerically trivial cycles.

sum of Q[G/Uj ] for some open compact subgroups Uj of G. However, the G-
modules Q[G/U ] seem to be very complicated. The last section contains two
examples of pairs of essentially different open compact subgroups U1 and
U2 of G with the same irreducible subquotients of Q[G/U1 ] and Q[G/U2 ].
As in both examples the primitive motives of maximal level of models of
F U1 and F U2 are trivial, one could expect that collections of irreducible
subquotients of Q[G/U ] are of motivic nature.
    In Appendix A one shows that the centers of the Hecke algebras of the
pairs (G, U ) and (G◦ , U ) (see §1.1 for the definition) consist of scalars for
any compact subgroup U in G. Compared to the analogous question for
p-adic groups, this is a negative result.


1.1 Notations, conventions and terminology

For a field F and a collection of its subrings F0 , (Fα )α∈I we denote by
G{F,(Fα )α∈I }/F0 the group of automorphisms of the field F over F0 pre-
serving all Fα , and set GF/F0 := G{F }/F0 . If K is a subfield of F then K
denotes its algebraic closure in F , tr.deg(F/K) the transcendence degree of
the extension F/K (possibly infinite, but countable), and UK denotes the
group GF/K . Throughout the paper k is an algebraically closed field, F its
algebraically closed extension with tr.deg(F/k) = n ≥ 1 and G = GF/k .
Everywhere, except the appendix, k is of characteristic zero.
     For a totally disconnected topological group H we denote by H ◦ its
subgroup generated by the compact subgroups. Obviously, H ◦ is a normal
subgroup in H, which is open at least if H is locally compact.
     In what follows, Q is the field of rational numbers, and a module is
always a Q-vector space. For an abelian group A set AQ = A ⊗ Q.
     A representation of H in a vector space W over a field is called smooth, if
stabilizers of all vectors in W are open. A smooth representation W is called
admissible if fixed vectors of each open subgroup form a finite-dimensional
subspace in W . A representation of H in W is called continuous, if stabilizers
of all vectors in W are closed. Any cyclic G-module is a quotient of the
continuous G-module Q[G], so any G-module is a quotient of a continuous
G-module.
     Q(χ) is the quotient of the free abelian group generated by the set of
compact open subgroups in G◦ by the relations [U ] = [U : U ′ ] · [U ′ ] for
all U ′ ⊂ U . If n < ∞ it is a one-dimensional Q-vector space oriented by
[U ] > 0 for any U . The group G acts on it by conjugation. χ : G −→ Q×    + is
the modulus.

1. It is shown that G is Hausdorff, locally compact if n < ∞, and totally
disconnected; the subgroups G{F,(Fα )α∈I }/k are closed in G, there is an in-
jective morphism of unitary semigroups
            {subfields in F over k} −→ {closed subgroups in G}
given by K 7−→ Aut(F/K), its image is stable under passages to sub-/sup-
groups with compact quotients, and it induces bijections

Lemma 2.1. If L ⊆ F containing k is the intersection of a collection {Lα }α
of its algebraic extensions then the subgroup in G generated by all ULα is
dense in UL .

Proof. Clearly, UL contains the subgroup in G generated by all ULα , and
GF/L is a normal subgroup in each of ULα and in UL . Set U Lα = ULα /GF/L ,
and similarly U L = UL /GF/L . These are compact subgroups in GL/k . Then,
under the above Galois correspondence, the closure of the subgroup in GL/k
                                                      hU L | αi     T
generated by all U Lα corresponds to the subfield L α            = α Lα = L,
i.e., to the same subfield as U L , which means that hU Lα | αi is dense in U L ,
and therefore, hULα | αi is dense in UL . ⊓  ⊔

Lemma 2.2. Let L ⊂ F be such an extension of k that any subextension
of transcendence degree ≤ 2 is of finite type over k. Then the common
normalizer in G of all normal closed subgroups of index ≤ 3 in UL coincides
with UL .

Proof. Any element τ in the common normalizer in G of all closed subgroups
of index ≤ 2 in UL satisfies τ (L(f 1/2 )) = L(f 1/2 ) for all f ∈ L× . If τ 6∈ UL
then there is an element x ∈ L× such that τ x/x 6= 1. Then τ x/x = y 2 for
some y ∈ F × −{±1}. Set f = x+λ for a variable λ∈ k. By Kummer theory,        
                                                               −2 1/2
τ f /f ∈ L×2 , and therefore, L contains L0 := k y (x+λy   )
                                                     (x+λ)1/2
                                                                        |λ∈k    ⊂
k(x, y).
    As tr.deg(k(x, y)/k) ≤ 2, by our assumption on L, the subfield L0 of L
should be finitely generated over k. But this is possible only if y 2 = 1, i.e.,
if τ ∈ UL . (To see this, one can choose a smooth model of the extension
L0 (x)/k(x, y) over k and look at its branch locus.) ⊓⊔

Corollary 2.3. For any ξ ∈ G − {1} and any open subgroup U ⊆ G there
exists an element σ ∈ U such that [σ, ξ] ∈ U − {1}.

Proof. Let L be such a subfield of F finitely generated over k that UL ⊆ U .
    Set L′ = Lξ(L). Then ξ −1 (σξσ −1 )|L = id for any σ ∈ UL′ . By Lemma
2.2, the centralizer in G of UL′ is trivial.
                                     S       (Let {Lα } be the set of all finitely
generated extensions of L′ . Then α Lα = F . Any element τ ∈ G central-
izing TUL′ normalizes all subgroups in all ULα , and thus, by Lemma 2.2,
τ ∈ α ULα = {1}.) In particular, as ξ does not centralize UL′ , there is
σ ∈ UL′ with ξ −1 σξσ −1 ∈ UL − {1}. ⊓    ⊔

Lemma
   T      2.4. Let H 6= {1} be a normal closed subgroup in G◦ such that
H U 6= {1} for a compact subgroup U . Then H contains Uk′ (x) for any
                                                                    T

Proof. Let σ ∈ H U − {1} and k ′ be the algebraic closure in F of any
               hσi
subfield in F      with tr.deg(F/k ′ ) = 1. As the extension F/F hσi is abelian

there is an element x ∈ F − k ′ and an integer N ≥ 2 such that σx 6= x and
σxN = xN . Then one has σ(k ′ (x)) = k ′ (x).
      Let L be a finite Galois extension of k ′ (x). Its smooth proper model over
  ′
k is unramified outside a finite set S of points on a smooth proper model of
k ′ (x) over k ′ . Then there is an element αL ∈ Aut(k ′ (x)/k ′ ) such that the set
α−1
  L σαL (S) does not intersect S, and therefore, for an extension αL ∈ GF/k′
                                                                                 ◦

                                                        −1
unramified over the model of k ′ (x), so L αL              σαL (L) = k ′ (x).

      Let β ∈ GF/k′ be given on k (x) by αL , and somehow extended to the
field α−1L σαL (L). Then β
                              −1

                                                 L ◦ σ ◦ αL is the identity on k (x),
                                                                          −1
and therefore, induces an  T automorphism of           L. Since L and αL σαL (L) are
Galois extensions of L α−1      L  σα   L (L) =  k ′
                                                     (x), for any given automorphism
τ of L over k ′ (x) there is an extension of β to F such that for its restriction
to L the composition β −1 ◦ σ −1 ◦ β T        ◦ α−1
                                                 L ◦ σ ◦ αL coincides with τ . This
means that the natural projection H Uk′ (x) −→TGal(L/k ′ (x)) is surjective
                                      ′
for any T Galois extension L of k (x), i.e., that H Uk′ (x) is dense in Uk′ (x) .
As H Uk′ (x) is closed, we have H ⊇ Uk′ (x) . ⊓            ⊔

Lemma 2.5. If n = 1 then there are no proper normal open subgroups in
G◦ .

Proof. Let H be a normal open subgroup in G◦ . Then for some subfield L ⊂
F finitely generated over k one has UL ⊆ H. For any purely transcendental
extension L′ ⊂ F of k with L′ = F one also has ULL′ ⊆ H, as well as
H ⊇ hσULL′ σ −1 | σ ∈ NG◦ UL′ i.
    A smooth proper model over k of the extension LL′ /L′ is ramified only
over a divisor on the model P1k of L′ over k, but the group              ′ ∼
                                                          T NG UL /UL =
                                                                 ◦  ′

PGL2 k does not preserve this divisor, so the intersection σ∈NG◦ UL′ σ(LL′ )
                                       T
is unramified over L′ , i.e., the field σ∈NG◦ UL′ σ(LL′ ) coincides with L′ .
By Lemma 2.1, this shows that H ⊇ UL′ for any purely transcendental
extension L′ ⊂ F of k with L′ = F , and therefore, H contains all compact
subgroups in G, so finally, H ⊇ G◦ . ⊓  ⊔

Lemma 2.6. Let H be a closed subgroup of G◦ . Assume that for any al-
gebraically closed extension k ′ of k in F with tr.deg(F/k ′ ) = 1 and any
x ∈ F − k ′ the subgroup H contains Uk′ (x) . Then H = G◦ .

Proof. Any element σ of a compact subgroup in G◦ can be presented as the
limit of a compatible collection (σL ) of embeddings σL of finitely generated
extensions L of k in F into F . Replacing L with the compositum of the
images of L under powers of σ, we may suppose that L is σ-invariant.
    For a finitely generated k-algebra R with the fraction field Lhσi , let X
be the affine variety over k with the coordinate ring R[t, σt, σ 2 t, . . . ] ⊂ L
for some t ∈ L such that L = Lhσi (t). Let Y := Spec(R) ⊆ AN    k .
    By induction on dim X we show that there is a fibration of a Zariski
open hσi-invariant subset of X by hσi-invariant irreducible curves. Namely,
if dim X = 1 there is nothing to prove. If dim X > 1 then, by Théorème 6.3

4) of [Jou],3 pull-backs of sufficiently general hyperplanes in AN   k under the
composition X −→ Y ֒→ Ak are irreducible, and thus, there is a fibration
of a Zariski open hσi-invariant subset U of X by hσi-invariant irreducible
divisors with the base S. By induction assumption, there is a fibration of a
Zariski open hσi-invariant subset of U ×S k(S) by hσi-invariant irreducible
curves over k(S), i.e., there is a fibration of a Zariski open hσi-invariant
subset U ′ of X by hσi-invariant irreducible curves over k.
    Then the function field k ′′ of the base is a subfield in Lhσi algebraically
closed in L and containing k. Let x ∈ Lhσi − k ′′ , and let k ′ be a maximal al-
gebraically closed subfield in F containing k ′′ but not x. Then σ|L coincides
with restriction to L of an element of Uk′ (x) . This shows that σ belongs to
the closure of the union of Uk′ (x) over all k ′ and all x ∈ F − k ′ . ⊓

gebraically independent over k.
Proof. We proceed by induction on m, the case m = 0 being trivial. We wish
to find wm ∈ F such that w and ξwm are algebraically independent over k ′
generated over k by w1 , . . . , wm−1 , ξw1 , . . . , ξwm−1 . Suppose that there is
no such wm . Then for any u ∈ F − k ′ and any v ∈ F − k ′ (ξu) one has the
                          2
following vanishings in ΩF/k   ′ : du∧dξu = dv ∧dξv = 0, d(u+v)∧dξ(u+v) =

0, and d(u + v ) ∧ dξ(u + v 2 ) = 0. Applying the first two to the third, we
                2

get 2(v − ξv)dv ∧ dξu = 0, which means that ξv = v for any v ∈ F − k ′ (ξu),
i.e., ξ = 1. This contradiction shows that there exists desired wm ∈ F . ⊓      ⊔
Lemma 2.8. Let L be a subfield of F with tr.deg(F/L) = ∞. Then G◦F/L

Proof. Fix a transcendence basis x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . of F over L. We wish to show
that for each σ ∈ GF/L , any integer m ≥ 1 and any y1 , . . . , ym ∈ F there
is a triplet (τ1 , τ2 , τ3 ) of elements of some compact subgroups in GF/L such
that τ3 τ2 τ1 σys = ys for all 1 ≤ s ≤ m. As y1 , . . . , ym are algebraic over
k0 := L(x1 , . . . , xM ) for some integer M ≥ m, it is enough to show that for
each σ ∈ GF/L and any integer M ≥ 1 there is a pair (τ1 , τ2 ) of elements of
some compact subgroups in GF/L such that τ2 τ1 σxs = xs for all 1 ≤ s ≤ M .
    Let k1 := k0 σ(k0 ), zj ∈ F − kj and kj+1 := kj (zj ) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M . Let
τ1 σxj = zj and τ1 zj = σxj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M and τ1 is somehow extended

Proof. Let H be a non-trivial closed subgroup in G normalized by G◦ . By
Corollary 2.3, H intersects non-trivially any open           T compact   subgroup in G◦
                                                                 ◦
if n < ∞. Then, by Lemma 2.4, the group H GF/k′ is an open normal
subgroup in G◦F/k′ for any algebraically closed extension k ′ of k in F with
                                                                T
tr.deg(F/k ′ ) = 1, and thus, by Lemma 2.5, H G◦F/k′ = G◦F/k′ . Then
Lemma 2.6 implies that H ⊇ G◦ .
     In the case n = ∞ and H is normal, we fix a pair of transcendence basis
x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . and y1 , y2 , y3 , . . . of F over k and show that for each m there
is an element σ ∈ H such that σxj = yj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m. Fix a non-trivial
element ξ ∈ H. Choose some elements z1 , . . . , zm algebraically independent
over k(x1 , . . . , xm , y1 , . . . , ym ). By Lemma 2.7, there exist w1 , . . . , wm ∈ F
such that w1 , . . . , wm , ξw1 , . . . , ξwm are algebraically independent over k.
Then there exist elements τ1 , τ2 ∈ G such that τ1 xj = wj , τ1 zj = ξwj and
τ2 yj = wj , τ2 zj = ξwj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m. Then σ := τ2−1 ◦ξ −1 ◦τ2 ◦τ1−1 ◦ξ ◦τ1
sends xj to yj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m.
     This implies that there is a compact subgroup U intersecting H non-
trivially, so by Lemma 2.4, H contains Uk′ (x) for some algebraically closed
extension k ′ of k in F with tr.deg(F/k ′ ) = 1, and for some x ∈ F − k ′ . By
Lemma 2.5, this implies that H contains G◦F/k′ .
     The algebraically closed extensions k ′ of k in F with tr.deg(F/k ′ ) = 1
form a single G-orbit, so one can apply Lemma 2.6, which gives H ⊇ G◦ .
Finally, it follows from Lemma 2.8 that H = G. ⊓                ⊔

intersection with G◦ . Then, by Theorem 2.9, the kernel of π contains G◦ .

Lemma 2.12. Let d ≥ 0 beTan integer, F1 and F2 be algebraically closed
subfields of F such that F1 F2 = k and tr.deg(F/F2 ) ≥ d. Then for any
subfield L in F with tr.deg(L/k) = d there is ξ ∈ H := hGF/F1 , GF/F2 i such
that tr.deg(ξ(L)F2 /F2 ) = d.

Proof. We proceed by induction on d, the case d = 0 being trivial. If d > 0 fix
a subfield L1 ⊂ L with tr.deg(L1 /k) = d − 1 and some t ∈ L transcendental
over L1 .
    Replacing F1 with the algebraic closure in F of the subfield generated
over F1 by a transcendence basis of F over F1 F2 (thus, making H smaller),
we may assume that F is algebraic over F1 F2 . In particular, there exists a
subfield K ⊂ F1 over k with tr.deg(K/k) = d and tr.deg(KF2 /F2 ) = d.

     By the induction assumption, there exists an element τ ∈ H such that
tr.deg(τ (L1 )F2 /F2 ) = d − 1, i.e., we may suppose that tr.deg(L1 F2 /F2 ) =
d − 1. Moreover, we may suppose that L1 = k(t1 , . . . , td−1 ) is purely tran-
scendental over k and L = L1 (t).
     The subgroup GF/F2 acts transitively on the set of purely transcenden-
tal extensions of F2 of a given transcendence degree, so for any collection
x1 , . . . , xd−1 of elements of F1 algebraically independent over F2 there is
σ ∈ GF/F2 such that σtj = xj .
     If t 6∈ L1 F2 then induction is completed, so we assume that t is algebraic
over L1 F2 , i.e., there is an irreducible polynomial P ∈ F2 [X1 , . . . , Xd ] −
k[X1 , . . . , Xd ] with P (t1 , . . . , td ) = 0, where td := t.

and the projection W −→ Ad−1         F2  to the first d − 1 coordinates. Suppose
that for any σ as above one has σt ∈ F1 . Then for any generic point
(x1 , . . . , xd−1 ) ∈ Ad−1
                         F     as above the points of the fiber of the projection
π over (x1 , . . . , xd−1 ) are defined
                                      T over F1 . This means that W is defined
over F1 , and therefore, over F1 F2 = k, contradicting tr.deg(L/k) = d.
    Therefore, there is σ ∈ GF/F2 such that σ(L1 ) ⊂ F1 and σt 6∈ F1 , so in
the rest of the proof we assume that L1 ⊂ F1 and t 6∈ F1 .
    The GF/F1 -orbit of t coincides with F − F1 . As the intersection

finally, tr.deg(ξ(L)F2 /F2 ) = d. ⊓

Corollary 2.13. In notations of Lemma 2.12, for any σ ∈ G there is τ ∈ H

Proof. According to Lemma 2.12, there exist elements ξ, ξ ′ ∈ H such that
         tr.deg(ξ ′ (L)F2 /F2 ) = tr.deg(ξσ(L)F2 /F2 ) = tr.deg(L/k).

Evidently, there is λ ∈ GF/F2 ⊂ H inducing an isomorphism ξ ′ (L) −→

L1 L2 is algebraic over L1 L2 and tr.deg(F/L2 ) = ∞. Then the sub-
group in G generated by GF/L1 and GF/L2 is dense in GF/L1 T L2 .
Proof. The inclusion hGF/L1 , GF/L2 i ⊆ GF/L1 T L2 is evident. In Corollary
                              T
2.13 we may replace k with L1 L2 to get that the subgroup in G generated
by GF/L1 and GF/L2 is dense in GF/L1 T L2 .

Lemma 2.15. If n < ∞ and F 6= k ′ , for a subfield k ′ over k in F , then
G = GF/k′ · G◦ .

Proof. We may suppose that k ′ is algebraically closed and maximal in F −
{x} for some x ∈ F − k. Fix a transcendence basis x1 , . . . , xn−1 of k ′ over
k. We have to show that for each σ ∈ G there is such an element τ ∈ G◦
that στ xs = xs for all 1 ≤ s < n.
      Set xn = x. Let 0 ≤ j < n be the maximal integer with the property that
there is an element τ ∈ G◦ such that στ ∈ GF/k′′ , where k ′′ = k(x1 , . . . , xj ).
For such τ set στ = σ ′ . Suppose that 0 ≤ j < n − 1. Then, by Lemma 2.7,
there exists w ∈ F − k ′′ such that w and σ ′ w are algebraically independent
over k ′′ . There are integers s, s′ > j such that w is transcendental over
k ′′ (xs ) and σ ′ w is transcendental over k ′′ (xs′ ).
      Then there are elements τ1 , τ2 , τ3 , τ4 of some compact subgroups of
GF/k′′ such that τ1 xj+1 = xs , τ2 xs = w, τ3 (σ ′ w) = xs′ , τ4 xs′ = xj+1 .
Then the automorphism τ4 τ3 σ ′ τ2 τ1 = στ0 , where τ0 ∈ G◦ , acts trivially on
k ′′ (xj+1 ), contradicting our assumptions. This means that j = n − 1. ⊓      ⊔

Lemma 2.16. Let L be a subfield of F and S be a set of elements of F alge-
braically independent over L. Then the group H generated by GF/L(S−{x})
for all x ∈ S is dense in GF/L .

                                                                    ′
Proof. If H contains the subgroups GF/L(S ′ ) for all   S subsets S ⊂ S with
finite complement then it contains the closure of S ′ GF/L(S ′ ) coincident
with GF/L(T S′ S ′ ) = GF/L . So it suffices to treat the case S = {x, y}.
    For any z ∈ F − L there is an element σ ∈ GF/L(x) GF/L(y) such that
σx = z, so H contains σGF/L(x) σ −1 = GF/L(z) , and thus, H is a normal
subgroup in UL . By Theorem 2.9, H contains GF/L if tr.deg(F/L) = ∞, and
H contains G◦F/L otherwise. By Lemma 2.15, in the latter case the projection
GF/L(x) −→ GF/L /G◦F/L is surjective, and thus, hGF/L(x) , GF/L(y) i surjects
onto GF/L /G◦F/L , so hGF/L(x) , GF/L(y) i = GF/L .
   As the subgroup GF/L(x) of H surjects onto GF/L /GF/L ∼
                                                         = Aut(L/L),
and H is an extension of a subgroup in GF/L /GF/L by GF/L ⊆ H, we get
H = GF/L . ⊓ ⊔


3 Some geometric representations

Now we are going to construct a supply of semi-simple admissible represen-
tations of G. Recall ([BZ]), that for each smooth E-representation W of G
and each compact subgroup U of G the Hecke algebra HE (U ) acts on the
space W U , since W U = hU (W ).
    Note that the definition in §1.1 on p.7 is equivalent to the usual definition
of G the Hecke algebra when U is open.

Proposition 3.1. 1. Let 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞. Then a smooth E-representation W
   of G is irreducible if and only if for each compact subgroup U with F U
   purely transcendental over an extension of k of finite type the HE (U )-
   module W U is irreducible.
2. Let Wj for j = 1, 2 be smooth irreducible E-representations of G and
   W1U 6= 0 for some compact subgroup U . Then W1 is equivalent to W2 if
   and only if W1U is equivalent to W2U .
3. For each open compact U ⊂ G and each irreducible E-representation τ
   of the algebra HE (U ) there is a smooth irreducible representation W of
   G with τ ∼= WU.
Proof. If n < ∞ then this is Proposition 2.10 of [BZ]. In the case n = ∞
the proof is modified as follows.
1. Suppose that W is irreducible and W U 6= 0. If V is a non-zero HE (U )-
   submodule in W U then the natural morphism DE hU ⊗HE (U) V −→ W
   is non-zero, and thus, surjective. Then V = hU DE hU ⊗HE (U) V surjects
   onto W U , i.e., V = W U .
   Conversely, let W1 ⊂ W be a non-zero proper subrepresentation. Fix
   an element e ∈ W − W1 . There is a compact subgroup U ⊂ Stabe with
   F U purely transcendental over an extension of k of finite type. Then
   e ∈ W1U 6= W U , giving contradiction.
2. “Only if” part is evident, so suppose that the HE (U )-modules W1U and
   W2U are isomorphic. Then one has DE hU ⊗HE (U) W1U ∼   = DE hU ⊗HE (U)
   W2U . Set WU := {w ∈ W | hU DE w = 0} and U W := W/WU .
   Then U (DE hU ⊗HE (U) WjU ) is irreducible, since otherwise the inclusion
   0 6= W3 ⊂ U (DE hU ⊗HE (U) WjU ) would imply W3U = WjU , and therefore,
   that W3 = U (DE hU ⊗HE (U) WjU ). This gives that

      W1 =   U (DE hU   ⊗HE (U) W1U ) ∼
                                      =   U (DE hU   ⊗HE (U) W1U ) = W2 . ⊓
                                                                          ⊔
Lemma 3.2. Let W be a smooth E-representation of G. Suppose that for
each compact subgroup U ⊂ G with F U purely transcendental over an ex-
tension of k of finite type the HE (U )-submodule W U is semi-simple. Then
W is semi-simple.
Proof. Let W0 be the sum of all irreducible E-subrepresentations of G in W .
Suppose W 6= W0 and e ∈ W −TW0 . Let V be the subrepresentation of G in
W generated by e, and V0 = V W0 . Let V2 be a maximal subrepresentation
of G in V − {e} containing V0 . Then the representation V1 = V /V2 of G is
irreducible. Our goal is to embed V1 into W . Let U be a compact subgroup in
G such that F U is purely transcendental over an extension of k of finite type
and V1U 6= 0. By Proposition 3.1(1), the HE (U )-module V1U is irreducible.
As the HE (U )-module V U is semi-simple and V U /V2U is isomorphic to V1U ,
there is an HE (U )-submodule NU in V U isomorphic to V1U and intersecting
V2 trivially.
    For each open subgroup U ′ of U the HE (U ′ )-submodule NU′ ′ of U ′ -
invariants of the subrepresentation of G in V generated by NU splits into

    As (NU′ ′ )U = hU ∗ DE NU = hU ∗ DE ∗ hU NU = NU , there is exactly one
index j such that AU   j 6= 0. For this index one has mj = 1. By Proposition
3.1(3), there are smooth irreducible representations W1 and W2 of G such
that W1U ∼
          ′
            = Aj and W2U ∼
                            ′
                               = V1U . Since W1U ∼
                                      ′
                                                 = W2U , by Proposition 3.1(2),
one has W1 ∼                  ∼     ′
                                  U
               =WS2 , so Aj = V1 . Set NU ′ = Aj .
    Then N := U ′ ⊂U NU ′ is a E-subrepresentation of G in V intersecting
V0 trivially. (The action of σ ∈ G on NUL for some finite extension L of
F U is given by the composition of the embedding NUL ⊆ NULσ(L) with
hLσ(L) ∗ σ ∗ hLσ(L) ∈ End(NULσ(L) ). Here hL := hUL is the Haar measure
on UL , and we have used σ : W UL −→ W Uσ(L) ⊆ W ULσ(L) .) By Proposition
3.1(1), the E-representation N of G is irreducible. This contradicts the
definition of W0 . ⊓  ⊔

    For any irreducible variety Y over k with k(Y ) = F U for a compact
open subgroup U in G one can identify the Hecke algebra H(U ) with the
Q-algebra of non-degenerate correspondences on Y (i.e., of formal linear
combinations of n-subvarieties in Y ×k Y dominant over both factors Y ).
This follows from the facts that the set of double classes U \G/U can be
identified with a basis of H(U ) as a Q-space via [σ] 7−→ hU ∗ σ ∗ hU ; that
irreducible n-subvarieties in Y ×k Y dominant over both factors Y are in
a natural bijection with the set of maximal ideals in F U ⊗k F U , and the
following lemma.
Lemma 3.3. Let L, L′ ⊆ F be field subextension of k with tr.deg(L/k) =
q < ∞. Then the set of double classes UL′ \G/UL is canonically identi-
fied with the set of all points in Spec(L ⊗k L′ ) of codimension ≥ q −
tr.deg(F/L′ ) (so UL′ \G/UL = Max(L ⊗k L′ ), if F = L′ ). Here G/UL =
{embeddings of L into F over k}.
Proof. To any embedding σ : L ֒→ F over k one associates the ideal in L⊗k F
generated by elements x ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ σx for all x ∈ F . It is maximal, since it is
                                        σ·id
the kernel of the surjection L ⊗k F −→ F . Conversely, any maximal ideal m
                                                         ϕ
in L ⊗k F determines a homomorphism L ⊗k F −→ (L ⊗k F )/m = Ξ with Ξ
a field. Since its restriction to the subfield k ⊗k F is an embedding, one can
regard F as a subfield of Ξ. Let t1 , . . . , tm be a transcendence basis of L over
k. As L is algebraic over L0 := k(t1 , . . . , tm ), Ξ is integral over ϕ(L0 ⊗k F ), so
the latter is a field. One has Spec(L0 ⊗k F ) ⊂ Spec(F [t1 , . . . , tm ]) = Am     F.
On any subvariety of Am     F outside the union of all divisors defined over k
there is an F -point which also lies outside the union of all divisors defined
over k, and therefore, Max(L0 ⊗k F ) ⊂ Max(F [t1 , . . . , tm ]). This means
that ϕ(L0 ⊗k F ) = F , and therefore, Ξ = F . The restriction of ϕ to L ⊗k k
gives an embedding σ : L ֒→ F over k. ⊓         ⊔

    Let Aq (Y ) be the quotient of the Q-space Z q (Y ) of cycles on a smooth

proper variety Y over k of codimension q by the Q-subspace Z∼        (Y ) of cy-
cles ∼-equivalent to zero for an adequate equivalence relation ∼. According
to Hironaka, each smooth variety X admits an open embedding i into a
smooth proper variety X over k. Then Aq (−) can be extended to arbitrary
                                                   q                               i∗

    In the standard way one extends the contravariant functors Aq ( ) and
  q
Z ( ) to contravariant functors on the category of smooth pro-varieties over
k. Namely, if for a set of indices I, an inverse system (Xj )j∈I of smooth
varieties over k is formed with respect to flat morphisms and X is the limit,
then Z q (X) = lim Z q (Xj ), where the direct system is formed with respect

to the pull-backs, and similarly for Aq ( ). This is independent of the choice
of the projective system defining X.
    In particular, as for any commutative k-algebra R the scheme Spec(R)
is an inverse limit of a system of k-varieties, Aq (R) := Aq (Spec(R)) is
defined. Any automorphism α of the k-algebra R induces a morphism of
a system (Xj )j∈I defining Spec(R) to a system (α∗ (Xj ))j∈I canonically
equivalent to (Xj )j∈I , and therefore, induces an automorphism of Aq (YR )
for any k-scheme Y . This gives a contravariant functor from a category of
varieties over k to the category of Aut(R/k)-modules. Set B q (X) = Aq (X)
for ∼=numerical equivalence.
    In what follows X will be of type YF for a k-subscheme Y in a variety
over k. It should be stressed that in this case B q (X) = B q (YF ) means
not some sort of numerical equivalence over F , but a limit of cycle groups
modulo numerical equivalence of varieties over k.

    The homomorphism of algebras H(U ) −→ Adim Y (Y ×k Y ) is surjective
for any smooth projective Y , as one can see from the following “moving

Lemma 3.4. Let Z, X1 , . . . , Xr be irreducible projective varieties over k,
           pj
and let Z −→ Xj be surjective maps. Let α ⊂ Z be an irreducible subvariety
of dimension q ≥ max dim Xj . Then α is rationally equivalent to a linear
                   1≤j≤r
combination of some irreducible subvarieties in Z surjective (under maps
pj ) over all Xj ’s.

Proof. Choose a closed irreducible subvariety W in Z containing α as a
divisor such that W is surjective (under maps pj ) over all Xj . We can
replace Z by W and assume that α has codimension 1 in Z. Then we can
replace Z by the blowup of Z along α. Since α is the direct image of its
pullback, we can assume α is a Cartier divisor on Z. Since our varieties
are taken to be projective, any Cartier divisor is rationally equivalent to a
difference of two very ample divisors, which we take to dominate the Xj ’s.

    For each pair of reduced irreducible group schemes A and B over k there

                    σ
embedding k(Y ) ֒→ F . For any ξ ∈ G one has ϕ(ξσ) = ξϕ(σ), in particular,
if ξ|σ(k(Y )) = id then ϕ(σ) ∈ Aq (XF )Uσ(k(Y )) = Aq (Xσ(k(Y )) ).5 From this
and the fact that the pairing Aq (X ×k Y ) ⊗ Adim Y (YF ) −→ Aq (XF ) factors
through Aq (Xk(Y ) ) ⊗ Adim Y (YF ) −→ Aq (XF ),6 one deduces that sending a
cycle α ∈ Aq (Xk(Y ) ) to the action of its arbitrary lifting to a correspondence
on X ×k Y determines a homomorphism

                 Aq (Xk(Y ) ) −→ HomG (Adim Y (YF ), Aq (XF )),

which is surjective and canonical. On the other hand, it has the inverse

given by ϕ 7−→ σ∗−1 ϕ(σ), where σ∗ : Aq (Xk(Y ) ) −→ Aq (Xσ(k(Y )) ).
    The map Hom(A, B) −→ HomG (A(F ), B(F )) is clearly injective. Let

over k generating A as an algebraic group, i.e., with the dominant multipli-
cation map C N −→ A for any N ≥ dim A. Fix a generic point x ∈ C(F ).
Since ϕ(τ x) = τ ϕ(x), the element ϕ(x) is fixed by any element τ fixing
x, so any coordinate of ϕ(x) is a rational function over k in coordinates
of x, and therefore, this gives rise to a rational k-map h : C − − → B.
Consider the rational k-map C N − − → B given by (x1 , . . . , xN ) 7−→
h(x1 ) · · · h(xN ). On the set of F -points out of the union of “vertical” di-
visors, (i.e., on Max(k(C) ⊗k · · · ⊗k k(C) ⊗k F )) this map coincides with

also be a homomorphism, and in particular, regular. ⊓ ⊔

Corollary 3.7. For any field L′ of finite type and of transcendence degree
m ≤ n over k, any field L of finite type over k and any integer q ≥ m there
is a canonical isomorphism

where the both groups are zero if q > m.

Proof. Let Y be an irreducible smooth projective variety over k with the
function field k(Y ) = L′ . The group Am (L′ ⊗k F ) is the quotient of Am (YF )
by the sum of the images of Am−1 (D   e F ) for all divisors D on Y and their
desingularizations D.e
   Then the target of (3.1) is a subgroup in HomG (Am (YF ), Aq (L ⊗k F )).
   By Proposition 3.6, HomG (Am (YF ), Aq (L ⊗k F )) = Aq (L ⊗k L′ ), and

Proposition 3.8. The G-module7 BqX = B q (X ×k F ) is admissible for any
smooth proper k-variety X and any q ≥ 0. If n < ∞ then BqX is semi-simple.
    If q = 0, or q = 1, or q = dim X ≤ n then BqX is semi-simple and of
finite length.

Proof. By a standard argument, we may suppose that k is embedded into
the field of complex numbers C, and thus, for any smooth proper k-variety
Y with k(Y ) ⊂ F the space B q (X ×k F )Uk(Y ) is a quotient of the finite-
dimensional space Z q (X ×k Y )/ ∼hom ⊆ H 2q ((X ×k Y )(C), Q(q)), so the
representation B q (X ×k F ) is admissible.
    For each smooth irreducible variety Y over k with k(Y ) ⊂ F and k(Y ) =
F the kernel of Aq (X ×k Y ) −→ Aq (X ×k k(Y )) is a An (Y ×k Y )-submodule
in Aq (X ×k Y ), since for its arbitrary element α and for any element β ∈
An (Y ×k Y ) one has α ◦ β = pr13∗ (pr∗12 α · pr∗23 β), so
                                                         T the projection to Y of
the support of α ◦ β is contained in pr2 ((D ×k Y ) supp(β)) for a divisor
D on Y , which is of dimension n − 1, so cannot dominate Y . This implies
that Aq (X ×k k(Y )) has a natural structure of a An (Y ×k Y )-module.
    By [Jan], the algebra B n (Y ×k Y ) is semi-simple, so the B n (Y ×k Y )-
module B q (X ×k k(Y )) is also semi-simple. By the moving lemma 3.4, the
ring homomorphism HUk(Y ) −→ B n (Y ×k Y ), induced by the identification
of the Hecke algebra HUk(Y ) with the algebra of non-degenerate correspon-
dences on Y , (see p.15) is surjective. This gives a (semi-simple) HUk(Y ) -
module structure on any B n (Y ×k Y )-module. Then, by Lemma 3.2, the
G-module B q (X ×k F ) is semi-simple.

     Recall that B q (X ×k F ) is a limit of certain quotients of Q-spaces of classes
of numerical equivalence of cycles on smooth proper varieties over k, but not over
F , cf. pp.16–17 before Lemma 3.4.

     Now suppose that n = ∞. By the same result of Jannsen [Jan], the cate-
gory
L of motives modulo numerical equivalence is semi-simple. Let (X, ∆X ) =
   j (X, πj ) be a decompositionL    into a (finite) direct sum of irreducible
submotives. Then B q (XF ) =                  q                     q
                                        j πj B (XF ). If W = πj B (XF ) is re-
ducible there is a non-zero proper G-submodule W0 in W . Fix elements
e0 ∈ W0 − 0 and e1 ∈ W − W0 . Then the common stabilizer of e0 and e1
is an open subgroup in G, so it contains a subgroup UL for a subfield L
of F finitely generated over k. Let F ′ be an algebraically closed extension
                                                      G    ′
of L with dim X ≤ tr.deg(F ′ /k) < ∞. Then W0 F/F is a non-zero proper
                                                G
GF ′ /k -module in W GF/F ′ = πj (B q (XF )) F/F ′ , so the length of the GF ′ /k -
                q       GF/F ′        q
module πj (B (XF ))            = πj B (XF ′ ) is ≥ 2. By Proposition 3.6, there
is a canonical surjection Endmotive/k ((X, πj )) −→ EndGF ′ /k (πj B q (XF ′ )) if
q ∈ {0, 1, dim X}. By the irreducibility of (X, πj ) we have a division algebra
on the left hand side, but the algebra on the right hand side has divisors of
zero since the GF ′ /k -module πj B q (XF ′ ) is semi-simple, but not irreducible,
giving contradiction.
     Any cyclic semi-simple G-module, Bdim    X
                                                  X
                                                    in particular (Corollary 3.5),
is of finite length.
     It follows from Lefschetz theorem on (1, 1)-classes that for any smooth
proper k-variety Y one has B 1 (X ×k Y ) = B 1 (X) ⊕ Hom(AlbX, AlbY ) ⊕
B 1 (Y ). By Lefschetz hyperplane section theorem, inclusion C ֒→ X of any
smooth 1-dimensional plane section C of X induces a surjection AlbC −→
AlbX. This implies that B1X is embedded into B 1 (X) ⊕ B1C , so it is also of
finite length. ⊓  ⊔

Corollary 3.9. One has HomG (B q (L′ ⊗k F ), B p (L ⊗k F )) = 0 for any pair
of fields L, L′ finitely generated over k with tr.deg(L/k) = p, tr.deg(L′ /k) =
q and p 6= q.

Proof. If p > n, or q > n, then at least one of B q (L′ ⊗k F ) and B p (L ⊗k F )
is zero, so we may assume that max(p, q) ≤ n. By Proposition 3.8, the G-
modules B q (L′ ⊗k F ) and B p (L ⊗k F ) are semi-simple, so HomG (B q (L′ ⊗k
F ), B p (L ⊗k F )) is isomorphic to HomG (B p (L ⊗k F ), B q (L′ ⊗k F )), so we
may assume that p > q. Then, by Corollary 3.7, one has HomG (B q (L′ ⊗k
F ), B p (L ⊗k F )) = B p (L ⊗k L′ ) = 0. ⊓

Corollary 3.10. Let X and Y be smooth irreducible proper varieties over

dual. If n < ∞ and dim X ≤ n this duality induces a non-degenerate G-
equivariant pairing

Proof. Let dim Y ≥ dim X. Set n = dim Y . By Proposition 3.6,

               B dim X (Xk(Y ) ) = HomG (B n (YF ), B dim X (XF ))

and B n (Yk(X) ) = HomG (B dim X (XF ), B n (YF )). By Proposition 3.8, the
G-modules B n (YF ) and B dim X (XF ) are semi-simple and of finite length.
For any α ∈ B dim X (Xk(Y ) ) and β ∈ B n (Yk(X) ) set hα · βi = tr(α ◦ β)
(= tr(β ◦ α)). Here α and β are considered as G-homomorphisms. If α 6= 0
there is an element γ ∈ B n (Yk(X) ) such that α ◦ γ is a non-zero projector
in EndG B dim X (XF ), so the form h · i is non-degenerate.
   The form B dim X (XF ) ⊗ lim B n ((YU )k(X) ) −→ Q(χ) is defined by α ⊗

    The above examples of G-modules are obtained from some (pro-)varieties
over k by extending the base field to F . More generally, one can construct a
G-module starting from some birationally invariant functor F on a category

    Divalg (YU ) is independent of the choice of YU , since any birational morphism

modulo linear equivalence (= Pic◦ -groups).

             BX,Y,Z = HomH(U) (B q (Z ×k Y ), B p (k(X) ⊗k k(Y ))).
       p,q
Then BX,Y,Z  = 0, if either q = dim Z < p, or q = n and dim Z < p, or
q > n and p + q > dim Z + n, or q < p and q ∈ {0, 1}.
Proof.
 – Let dim Z = q < p. As B q (Z ×k Y ) = (BqZ,Y )U , it follows from the mov-
   ing lemma 3.4 that W1 := BqZ,Y is a quotient of the module Z q (k(Z) ⊗k
   F ) (since W1U = W U , where W is the quotient of Z q (k(Z) ⊗k F )
   by its G-submodule generated by the kernel of Z q (k(Z) ⊗k k(Y )) −→
   B q (Z ×k Y )).
   As HomG (Z q (k(Z) ⊗k F ), B p (k(X) ⊗k F )) = 0, this gives
                         HomG (W1 , B p (k(X) ⊗k F )) = 0.
  We need to show that HomH(U) (W U , B p (k(X) ⊗k k(Y ))) = 0.
  By Proposition 3.1, for any pair (W1 , W2 ) of semi-simple G-modules
  the natural homomorphism HomG (W1 , W2 ) −→ HomH(U) (W1U , W2U ) is
  surjective. Then, as its source is zero when W2 = B p (k(X) ⊗k F ), we
  get the vanishing of the space HomH(U) ((BqZ,Y )U , B p (k(X) ⊗k k(Y ))).
– Let c = n − dim Z, so the variety Z × Pc is n-dimensional. As there is
  an embedding of H(U )-modules B n (Z ×k Y ) ֒→ B n (Z ×k Pc ×k Y ), it
                                           p,n
  is enough to show the vanishing of BX,Y,Z×P    c for p > dim Z. By semi-

  simplicity, the latter is a subgroup in HomG (BnZ×Pc ,Y , B p (k(X)⊗k F )) ⊆
  HomG (Z n (k(Z × Pc ) ⊗k F ), B p (k(X) ⊗k F )). By Proposition 3.6, the
  latter coincides with B p (k(X) ⊗k k(Z × Pc )), which is dominated by
                        ∼                                         p,n
  B p (Ack(X)⊗k k(Z) ) ←− B p (k(X) ⊗k k(Z)) = 0, and thus, BX,Y,Z       = 0, if
  p > dim Z.                L           n e
– As the H(U )-module          D∈Z q−n B (D ×k Y ) surjects onto the H(U )-
                                                           p,q
  module B q (Z ×k Y ) when q > n, the vanishing of BX,Y,Z         follows from
    p,n
  B      e = 0 for each subvariety D of codimension q − n on Z.
     X,Y,D
– If q = 1 then B 1 (Z ×k Y ) is a subquotient of B 1 (C ×k Y ) for a smooth
  curve C, so we are reduced to the case q = dim Z < p. The case q = 0
  is trivial. ⊓

Proposition 3.14. Let X and Y be smooth irreducible varieties over k, and
either q ∈ {0, 1, 2}, or q = dim X = dim Y . Then there is a unique

3.1 The projector ∆k(X)

For any pair of varieties X, Y let t be the transposition of cycles, induced
            ∼
by X × Y −→ Y × X. Denote by ∆k(X) = t ∆k(X) the identity (diagonal)
element in B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X)) considered as an element of B n (X ×k X).

Lemma 3.15. For any irreducible smooth proper k-variety X of dimension
n the element ∆k(X) is a central projector in the algebra B n (X ×k X). The
left (equivalently, right) ideal generated by ∆k(X) coincides with (the image
of ) B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X)).

Proof. Denote by ϕ the projection B n (X ×k X) −→ B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X)) and
by ψ its unique section B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X)) −→ B n (X ×k X). The kernel of
ϕ coincides with the sum of the kernels of B n (X ×k X) −→ B n (X ×k k(X))
and of B n (X ×k X) −→ B n (k(X) ×k X), where the projections are induced
by the ring homomorphisms

            B n (X ×k X) −→ EndG B n (X ×k F ) = B n (X ×k k(X))

and B n (X ×k X) −→ EndG B n (F ×k X) = B n (k(X) ×k X), so ker ϕ is a
two-sided ideal. Then the image of ϕ is a B n (X ×k X)-bi-module, and thus,
the image of ψ is a two-sided ideal in B n (X ×k X).
    As α ◦ ∆X = ∆X ◦ α for any α ∈ B n (X ×k X), and ϕ and ψ are
morphisms of B n (X ×k X)-bi-modules, one has αψ(ϕ(∆X )) = ψ(ϕ(α ◦
∆X )) = ψ(ϕ(∆X ◦ α)) = ψ(ϕ(∆X ))α, so α∆k(X) = ∆k(X) α. The B n (X ×k
X)-action on B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X)) factors through B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X)), so
∆2k(X) = ∆X ∆k(X) = ∆k(X) . ⊓  ⊔

Lemma 3.16. ∆k(X) B dim X (XL ) = B dim X (k(X) ⊗k L) for any irreducible
smooth proper k-variety X and any field extension L of k.

Proof. Set d = dim X. Using homotopy invariance and the Galois descent
property of B ∗ , we may replace L by an algebraically closed extension F
with tr.deg(F/k) = n ≥ d and then ∆k(X) B d (XL ) = (∆k(X) B d (XF ))GF/L
and B d (k(X) ⊗k L) = B d (k(X) ⊗k F )GF/L .
   By Proposition 3.6 and Corollary 3.7, the canonical maps

     B d (k(X) ⊗k k(X)) −→ EndG B d (k(X) ⊗k F )
                                    −→ HomG (B d (XF ), B d (k(X) ⊗k F ))

are isomorphisms. As ∆k(X) is the identity element in EndG B d (k(X) ⊗k F ),
this means that ∆k(X) B d (XF ) = B d (k(X) ⊗k F ). ⊓
                                                    ⊔

Proposition 3.17. (X, ∆k(X) ) is the maximal primitive n-submotive of the
motive (X, ∆X ) for any smooth irreducible proper n-dimensional k-variety
X. The motive (X, ∆k(X) ) is a birational invariant of X.

Proof. To show that (X, ∆k(X) ) is a primitive n-motive, we have to check
that the Q-vector space W := ∆k(X) B n (X ×k Y × P1 ) is zero for any variety
Y of dimension < n. Replacing Y with Y × Pn−dim Y −1 we may suppose
that dim Y = n − 1.
    W is a left B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X))-module, since by Lemma 3.15, ∆k(X) is
a central projector in B n (X ×k X) and B n (X ×k X)∆k(X) = B n (k(X) ⊗k
k(X)).
    In notations of Lemma 3.13 one has
                                                              n,n
  HomB n (X×k X) (B n (X ×k Y × P1 ), B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X))) =: BX,X,Y ×P1
                                                       n,n
                                                             M    n,n−1
                                                    = BX,X,Y     BX,X,Y .
                                          n,n−1
By the first case of Lemma 3.13, one has BX,X,Y = 0; by the second case
                          n,n             n,n
of Lemma 3.13, one has BX,X,Y = 0, so BX,X,Y ×P1 = 0. Then the semi-
simplicity implies that

        HomB n (X×k X) (B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X)), B n (X ×k Y × P1 )) = 0.

As W is a quotient of a direct sum of several copies of B n (k(X)⊗k k(X)), but
there are no non-zero B n (X ×k X)-module quotients of B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X))
in B n (X ×k Y × P1 ), this means that W = 0.
    For the maximality of (X, ∆k(X) ) among primitive n-submotives of the
motive (X, ∆X ), we have to show that Hom(M, X) = Hom(M, (X, ∆k(X) ))
for any primitive n-motive M = (Z, π). Hom(X, M ) = πB n (Z ×k X). For
any divisor D on X one has πB n−1 (Z ×k D) e = 0, so from the exact sequence
    M
         πB n−1 (Z ×k D)e −→ πB n (Z ×k X) −→ πB n (Z ×k k(X)) −→ 0
   D∈X 1

we get πB n (Z ×k X) = πB n (Z ×k k(X)). By Proposition 3.6,

                B n (Z ×k k(X)) = HomG (B n (XF ), B n (ZF )),

so Hom(X, M ) = πHomG (B n (XF ), B n (ZF )). By Proposition 3.6, for any
divisor D on X one has

           HomG (B n−1 (DF ), πB n (ZF )) = πB n−1 (Z ×k k(D)) = 0,

so Hom(X, M ) = πHomG (B n (k(X) ⊗k F ), B n (ZF )). By Lemma 3.16, the
space B n (k(X)⊗k F ) coincides with the image of the projector ∆k(X) acting
on B n (XF ), so

  Hom(X, M ) = πHomG (∆k(X) B n (XF ), B n (ZF ))
                                      = πHomG (B n (XF ), B n (ZF ))∆k(X) .

Since the space HomG (B n (XF ), B n (ZF )) is a quotient of B n (Z ×k X), we
get that the space Hom(X, M ) is a quotient of πB n (Z ×k X)∆k(X) =
Hom((X, ∆k(X) ), M ). On the other hand, the space Hom((X, ∆k(X) ), M )
26                                                                     M.Rovinsky


is a quotient of Hom(X, M ). As both spaces are finite-dimensional, they
coincide.
    The birational invariantness of (X, ∆k(X) ) follows from the birational
invariantness of Y prim for any smooth projective variety Y over k explained
in the beginning of §3.2 below.9 ⊓ ⊔

Corollary 3.18. Let X and Y be smooth irreducible proper varieties over
k, and dim X = dim Y = n. Then the unique submodule         of the module
B n (X ×k Y ) over B dim X (X ×k X) ⊗ B dim Y (Y ×k Y )op isomorphic to its
quotient B n (k(X) ⊗k k(Y )) coincides with ∆k(X) · B n (X ×k Y ) = B n (X ×k
Y ) · ∆k(Y ) = ∆k(X) · B n (X ×k Y ) · ∆k(Y ) .

Proof. By Proposition 3.17, (X, ∆k(X) ) and (Y, ∆k(Y ) ) are the maximal
primitive n-submotives in (X, ∆X ) and (Y, ∆Y ), so

              Hom(X, (Y, ∆k(Y ) )) = Hom((X, ∆k(X) ), (Y, ∆k(Y ) )).

By definition,

     Hom(X, (Y, ∆k(Y ) )) := B n (X ×k Y ) · ∆k(Y )
        and Hom((X, ∆k(X) ), (Y, ∆k(Y ) )) := ∆k(X) · B n (X ×k Y ) · ∆k(Y ) ,

and thus, B n (X ×k Y ) · ∆k(Y ) = ∆k(X) · B n (X ×k Y ) · ∆k(Y ) .
    Similarly, ∆k(X) · B n (X ×k Y ) = ∆k(X) · B n (X ×k Y ) · ∆k(Y ) .
    As in the proof of maximality of (X, ∆k(X) ) in Proposition 3.17 we have
∆k(X) · B n (X ×k Y ) = ∆k(X) · B n (X ×k k(Y )). By Lemma 3.16 the latter
coincides with B n (k(X) ⊗k k(Y )). ⊓ ⊔


3.2 The functors B• and Bq
                                              prim
For a smooth
           Tprojective variety Y over k let Y      be the motive defined by
  prim
Y      :=     ker ϕ, where M runs over isomorphism classes of effective
             ϕ
           Y −→M⊗L
motives, or equivalently,
                                                           
                                        M
                   Y prim := coker            M ⊗ L −→ Y  .
                                           ϕ
                                     M⊗L−→Y

Clearly, Y 7−→ Y prim is a functor from the category of smooth projective
varieties to the category of motives modulo numerical equivalence. Any
birational map is a composition of blow-ups and blow-downs with smooth
centers ([AKMW,W]). As a blow-up does not change Y prim (cf. [M]), this
implies that Y prim is an invariant of the function field k(Y ). According to
 9
   One can show this directly as follows. By Corollary 3.18, for any primitive
n-motive M ∼  = (Y, π) with dim Y = n one has Hom(X, M ) := πB n (Y ×k X) =
πB n (k(Y ) ×k k(X)), which is independent of the model of k(X).

Hironaka, for any subfield L of F finitely generated over k there exists a
smooth projective variety Y[L] over k with the function field L, and therefore,

one gets a canonical projective system of motives {Y[L]         }L indexed by
subfields L of F finitely generated over k.

by induction on dimension d of X as follows. Let M0d = ϕ ker(ϕ), where
ϕ runs over the set of morphisms from M to motives of type (Y × P1 , ∆)
for all Y with dim Y < d. (By Proposition 3.17, M0d = (X, π ◦ ∆k(X) ).)
As the length of M is ≤ dimQ End(M ) < ∞, the motive M/M0d can be
embedded into a finite direct sum of (Yj × P1 , ∆) with dim Yj < d. As
(Yj × P1 , ∆) = (Yj , ∆) ⊕ (Yj , ∆) ⊗ L, the induction is completed. In fact,

    As B[0] (M )UL = Hom Y[L] , M = πB q (X ×k Y[L] ) and πB q (XF )UL =

3.3 “Polarization” on B n (k(X) ⊗k F ) and polarizable G-modules

Proposition 3.21. For any irreducible k-variety X of dimension n there
is a symmetric G-equivariant non-degenerate pairing
                                                       h , i
                B n (k(X) ⊗k F ) ⊗ B n (k(X) ⊗k F ) −→ Q(χ)
such that hp∗ (·), · i = h · , p∗ (·)i for any generically finite rational map p.
In particular, h , i induces non-degenerate pairings between the submodules
W := πB n (k(X) ⊗k F ) and t W := t πB n (k(X) ⊗k F ) for all projectors
π ∈ B n (k(X) ⊗k k(X)).
   If for (n − 1)-cycles on 2n-dimensional complex varieties the numerical
equivalence coincides with the homological one, then h , i is (−1)n -definite.
In particular, this holds for n ≤ 2.

Proof. We may suppose that X is a smooth projective variety over k. For
a pair α, γ ∈ B n (k(X) ⊗k F ) fixed by a compact open subgroup U ⊂ G
we define hα, γi ∈ Q(χ) by hb    α·bγ i · [U ], where α  b are the images of α, γ ∈
                                                      b, γ
B n (k(X) ⊗k k(YU )) in B n (X ×k YU ) in the sense of Proposition 3.14. Here
YU is a smooth proper variety over k with the function field k(YU ) identified
with F U , and h · i is the intersection form on B n (X×k YU ). By the projection
formula, hα, γi is independent of the choices, and hp∗ (·), · i = h · , p∗ (·)i.
    For a triplet of smooth proper varieties X1 , X2 , X3 , a triplet of integers
a, b, c ≥ 0 with a + b + c = dim(X1 × X2 × X3 ) and a triplet α ∈ Aa (X1 ×
X2 ), β ∈ Ab (X2 × X3 ), γ ∈ Ac (X1 × X3 ) one has hα ◦ β · γi = hβ · t α ◦ γi =
hα · γ ◦ t βi. For any α ∈ W − {0} fixed by U there is β ∈ B n (X ×k YU )
such that hb  α · βi 6= 0. Then, as α    b = π◦α   b ◦ ∆k(YU ) , one has hb
                                                                          α · βi =
 α · t π ◦ β ◦ ∆k(YU ) i 6= 0. As t π ◦ β ◦ ∆k(YU ) ∈ t W , this shows that
hb
h , i induces a non-degenerate pairing between W and t W for an arbitrary
projector π.
    By Lemma 3.13, HomH(U) (B n+1 (X ×k YU ), B n (k(X)⊗k k(YU ))) = 0. By
the semi-simplicity, this implies that the composition of the embedding of
                                                                               ·[L]
H(U )-modules B n (k(X) ⊗k k(YU )) ֒→ B n (X ×k YU ) with B n (X ×k YU ) −→
B n+1 (X ×k YU ) is zero for any L ∈ NS(X). Interchanging the roles of X
and YU , we see that the imageLof B n (k(X) ⊗k k(YU )) in B n (X ×k YU ) is
annihilated by any L ∈ NS(X) NS(YU ) ⊆ NS(X ×k YU ), i.e., it consists of

primitive elements. Then, by the Hodge index theorem, if for (n − 1)-cycles
on 2n-dimensional complex varieties the numerical equivalence coincides
with the homological one, then the pairing B n (k(X) ⊗k F ) ⊗ B n (k(X) ⊗k

                                ⊔
Proposition 3.22. Let V be a finite-dimensional Q-vector space with a
                                                        h   ,   i
positive definite symmetric pairing V ⊗ V −→ Q and with an action
H −→ GL(V ), p 7−→ σp of a subgroup H ⊆ Q×           + , generated by almost all
primes, such that hσp x, σp yi = p · hx, yi for all x, y ∈ V and for all p ∈ H.
Then V = 0.
Proof. Since a Q-multiple of σp is orthogonal, σp is diagonizable over Q for
all p ∈ H. As the group H is abelian, there is a basis {ei } of V ⊗ Q and
                                ×
characters λi : H −→ Q such that σr ei = λi (r)·ei . Note, that the elements
ei belong to V ⊗ K for a finite extension K of Q, so the characters factor
as λi : H −→ K × .
    For each embedding τ : K ֒→ C we define an hermitian form hx, yiτ :=
hτ x, τ yi, where h , i is the bilinear form on V ⊗ C induced by h , i
and       is the complex conjugation on V ⊗ C. One has 0 6= hσp ei , σp ei iτ =
τ (λi (p))τ (λi (p)) · hei , ei iτ = p · hei , ei iτ , so |τ (λi (p))| = p1/2 for any τ .
    Let L be the subfield in the normalization of K over Q generated by
all the conjugates over Q of the image of λ1 , so L is a Galois extension of
Q. For any embedding τ : K ֒→ C the image of L in C is invariant under
the complex conjugation, since τ λ1 (p) = p · (τ λ1 (p))−1 . As the latter does
not depend on the embedding, the complex conjugation induces an element
c in the center of Gal(L/Q). L cannot be totally real, since then it would
contain elements p1/2 for almost all prime p, and thus it would be √               of infinite
degree. As the field of invariants R of c is totally real, L = R( −α) for
some totally positive integer α ∈ OR . Let d = [R : Q].
    As the subgroup {1, c} is normal in Gal(L/Q), the field R is a Galois
extension of Q. By the Chebotarëv density theorem, there are infinitely
many rational primes p corresponding to the element (=the conjugacy class
of) c. As restriction of c to R is trivial, such ideals (p) split completely in the
extension R/Q, i.e., (p) = ℘1 · · · ℘d . On the other hand the ideals ℘1 , . . . , ℘d
stay prime in the extension L/R (one of them should stay prime, since c is
non-trivial, and the others lie in the Gal(L/Q)-orbit of such one).
    Now let integers x, y ∈ OR be such that x2 +                       2
                                                                  √ αy ∈ (p) ⊆ ℘j for any
j.
√  Since    ℘ j remains    prime    in O   ,
                                          L √ one    has  x  +  y   −α   ∈ ℘j for a choice of
   −α. Since ℘j is c-invariant, 2x, 2y −α ∈ ℘j , and thus, x, y ∈ ℘j for p big
enough with respect to α. So we get x, y ∈ ℘1 · · · ℘d = (p).
    If there is an element in L with the modulus p1/2 with respect to any
complex embedding of L, then there are non-zero integers x, y, z ∈ OR of
minimal possible norm of xyz such that x2 +αy 2 = pz 2 . As this implies z 2 ∈
(p), one should also have z ∈ (p) if L is unramified over p, and therefore, the
triplet (x/p, y/p, z/p) also satisfies the above conditions and has a smaller
“norm”. This is contradiction. ⊓           ⊔

   We shall say that an admissible G-module W is polarizable (when n <
∞) if there is a symmetric positive definite G-equivariant pairing W ⊗W −→
Q(χ).
Corollary 3.23. Let W be a polarizable G-module. Let L be an extension
of k in F . Then W UL(x) = 0 for any x ∈ F transcendental over L.
Proof. Since W is smooth, there is a finitely generated extension L1 of
k such that the stabilizer of an element w ∈ W UL(x) contains the open
subgroup hUL1 , UL(x) i. By Lemma 2.1, the latter contains UL2 (x)∩L3 (x) =
UL4 (x) , where L3 is generated over L by a transcendence basis of F over
L(x), L2 is generated
                T       over L1 by a transcendence basis of L3 over k, and
L4 := L2 (x) L3 is finitely generated over k. We replace L by L4 , thus
assuming, that L is finitely generated over k.
    As UL(x) ⊂ UL(xp ) = σUL(x) σ −1 , where σx = xp and σ|L = id, the
                                               ∼
element σ induces an isomorphism W UL(x) −→ W UL(xp ) , and W UL(xp ) ⊆
   UL(x)
W        , the dimension argument shows that σ induces an automorphism of
W UL(x) . For any w ∈ W one has hσw, σwi = χ(σ) · hw, wi, so Proposition
3.22 says that W UL(x) = 0. ⊓ ⊔
Corollary 3.24. Any finite-dimensional polarizable G-module is zero.

4 Morphisms between certain G-modules and matrix coefficients

4.1 Two remarks on the G-modules F/k and F × /k ×

Proposition 4.1. For any 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞ the G◦ -modules F/k and F × /k ×
are irreducible.
Proof. Let A be the additive subgroup of F generated by the G◦ -orbit of
some x ∈ F − k. For any y ∈ A − k one has y22−1 = y−1     1      1
                                                             − y+1        1
                                                                    . As y−1  and
  1               ◦                                   2
y+1  are in the  G  -orbit of y, this  implies that y   ∈ A. As for  any y, z ∈ A
               1         2            2
one has yz = 4 ((y + z) − (y − z) ), the group A is a subring of F .
    Let M be the multiplicative subgroup of F × generated by the G◦ -orbit
of some x ∈ F − k. Then for any y, z ∈SM one has y + z = z(y/z + 1), so if
y/z 6∈ k then y + z ∈ M , and thus, M {0} is a G◦ -invariant subring of F .
    Since the G◦ -orbit of an element x ∈ F − k contains all elements of
F − k(x), if n ≥ 2 then each element of F is the sum of a pair of elements in
the orbit. Any G◦ -invariant subring in F , but not in k, is a k-subalgebra, so
if n = 1 then Gal(F/Q(G◦ x)) ⊂ G◦ is a compact subgroup normalized by
G◦ . Then by Theorem 2.9 we have Gal(F/Q(G◦ x)) = {1}. As any element of
Q(G◦ x) is the fraction of a pair of elements in Z[G◦ x] and for any y ∈ F − k
the element 1/y belongs to the G◦ -orbit of y, one has Z[G◦ x] = F . ⊓      ⊔
Proposition 4.2. For any 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞ the annihilator of F/k in Dk and
the annihilator of F × /k × in DQ are trivial.

open subgroup UL , an integer N ≥ 1, some aj ∈ E and some pairwise
                                     /k
distinct embeddings σj : L ֒→ F . Here E is either k, or Q. Let τ ∈ G be
such an element that the embeddings σ1 , . . . , σN , τ σ1 , . . . , τ σN are pairwise
distinct.                                                        PN
    Suppose α annihilates F/k. For any x ∈ L one has j=1 aj · σj x ∈ k,
             PN                  PN
and thus, j=1 aj · σj x + j=1 (−aj ) · τ σj x = 0 for all x ∈ L. Then, by
Artin’s theorem on independence of characters, a1 = · · · = aN = 0.
    Similarly, suppose that α annihilates F × /k × . We may suppose that aj ∈
                                  QN                                 Q2N
Z. For any x ∈ L× one has j=1 (σj x)aj ∈ k × , and thus, j=1 (σj x)aj = 1
for all x ∈ L× , where σj = τ σj−N and aj = −aj−N for N < j ≤ 2N .
    Let τ1 , . . . , τM be a collection of pairwise distinct embeddings P    of L into
F and b1 , . . . , bM be such a collection of non-zero integers that M         j=1 |bj |
                                          QM         bj                       ×
is minimal among those for which j=1 (τj x) = 1 for all x ∈ L . Then

k. Then for any 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞
                                          ∼                        ∼
     Homgroup   schemes/k (A, B)Q     −→ HomG (WA , WB ) −→ HomG◦ (WA , WB ).

Proof.
1. First, consider the cases A, B ∈ {Ga , Gm }. Let ϕ ∈ HomG◦ (WA , WB )
                                                                        ◦
   and x ∈ WA − {0}. Then ϕ(x) is fixed by the stabilizer
                                                        T St◦x of x in G .
   The group Stx fits intoTan exact sequence 1 −→ Uk(x) G −→ Stx −→
                            U        G◦
      A(k) −→ 1. As WB k(x)        = (B(k(x))/B(k))Q and A(k) acts on k(x) by
                                                                          A(k)
      the affine linear substitutions of x, one has WBStx = (B(k(x))/B(k))Q .
                                                                       ×
       – If A = Gm and B = Ga then WBStx = (k(x)/k)k = 0, so ϕ = 0.
       – If A = Ga and B = Gm then WBStx = (k(x)× /k × )kQ = 0, so ϕ = 0.

                                                                      ×
    – If A = B = Gm then WBStx = (k(x)× /k × )kQ = {xλ | λ ∈ Q}, so
      ϕ(x) = xλ for some λ ∈ Q. This implies that ϕ(σx) = (σx)λ for all
      σ ∈ G◦ . As F × /k × is an irreducible G◦ -module, one has ϕy = y λ for
      all y ∈ F × /k × .
    – If A = B = Ga then WBStx = (k(x)/k)k = {λ · x | λ ∈ k}, so
      ϕ(x) = λ · x for some λ ∈ k. This implies that ϕ(σx) = λ · σx for all
      σ ∈ G◦ . As F/k is an irreducible G◦ -module, one has ϕy = λ · y for
      all y ∈ F/k.
2. Fix a smooth irreducible curve Z ⊆ A over k. For any generic point
             /k                                                       ϕ
   x : k(Z) ֒→ F and any G◦ -homomorphism WA −→ WB the element ϕ(x)
                                           ◦
                            U         ∩G
   belongs to the space WB x(k(Z))             = (B(x(k(Z)))/B(k))Q , and therefore,
                                                                            hx
   there is an integer Nx ≥ 1 and a rational map Z −− → B defined over
   k such that ϕ(x) = N1x hx (x). This implies that if ϕ 6= 0 and either
   A = Gm or A = Ga then B = Gm or B = Ga .
3. Now suppose that A and B are simple abelian varieties over k. Then the
                                                 ϕx
   maps hx are regular and factor as Z −→ JZ −→ B for some homomor-
   phisms ϕx from the Jacobian JZ .
4. If A and B are not isogeneous, there is such a curve Z that any homo-
   morphism of the group schemes JZ −→ B is trivial, and thus ϕ(x) = 0,
   so we may suppose that A = B.
5. There is such a curve Z that
                                                  ∼
       EndA := Endgroup     scheme/k (A)Q       −→ Homgroup               schemes/k (JZ , A)Q .

   Then one can consider ϕx as an element of EndA , i.e., ϕ(x) = N1x ϕx (x).
6. For any pair of generic points x1 , x2 ∈ Z(F ) there are generic points
                             t, y1 , . . . , yM , z1 , . . . , zM ′
   of Z(F ) such that the elements of both collections (x1 , t, y1 , . . . , yM )
   and (x2 , t, z1 , . . . , zM ′ ) are
                                     P linearly independent P in WA over the algebra
   EndA , and u := x1 + t + j yj and v := x2 + t + j zj are generic points
   of Z(F ).
   Then, by definition, ϕ(u) coincides with
                                                                        
                  1                   1                      X
                       ϕu (u) =           ϕu (x1 ) + ϕu (t) +    ϕu (yj ) ,
                 Nu                  Nu                       j

                                                 1
   and, as ϕ is a homomorphism, ϕ =             N x1   ϕx1 (x1 )+ N1t ϕt (t)+ N1y ϕy1 (y1 )+
                                                                                      1
   · · · + Ny1 ϕyM (yM ). We can assume that Nu = Nv = Nx1 = Nx2 = Nt .
              M
   Then one has ϕu = ϕx1 = ϕt . Similarly, one has ϕv = ϕx2 = ϕt , and
   therefore, the restriction of ϕ to the set of generic points of Z coincides
   with the restriction of ψ to the set of generic points of Z, for some
   ψ ∈ EndA .
   As generic points of Z generate A(F ) as an abstract group, this implies
   that ϕ = ψ, i.e., that ϕ ∈ EndA .

7. There remain the cases where A is an abelian variety and B is ei-
   ther Ga or Gm . As WB is an irreducible G◦ -module, any non-zero G◦ -
   homomorphism to WB is surjective. Any surjection of smooth represen-
   tations of G◦ induces a surjection of their subspaces fixed by a compact
   subgroup K of G. Taking K = UL′ , where L′ is a purely transcendental
   extension of k, we get contradiction showing that HomG◦ (WA , WB ) = 0.
   ⊔
   ⊓

Corollary 4.4. For any pair of pure 1-motives M1 , M2 one has

       HomG (B1 (M1 ), B1 (M2 )) = HomG◦ (B1 (M1 ), B1 (M2 )).          ⊓
                                                                        ⊔

Corollary 4.5. For any G-module W there is at most 1 character ψ such
that W (ψ) ∼
           = B1 (M ) for a pure 1-motive M .

Proof. Suppose that W is irreducible, W (ψ1 ) =∼ B1 (M1 ), W (ψ2 ) ∼
                                                                   = B1 (M2 )
for some pure 1-motives M1 and M2 and some characters ψ1 6= ψ2 . By the
fully faithfulness and the previous corollary,

 Hom(M1 , M2 ) = HomG (B1 (M1 ), B1 (M2 )) = HomG◦ (B1 (M1 ), B1 (M2 )),

so Hom(M1 , M2 ) = HomG◦ (W (ψ1 ), W (ψ2 )), which non-zero, since the G◦ -
modules W (ψ1 ) and W (ψ2 ) are isomorphic, and thus, M1 and M2 are iso-
morphic, which implies that W (ψ1 ) ∼
                                    = W (ψ2 ) as G-modules. We may as-
sume that ψ2 = 1. Set ψ = ψ1 6= 1.
    The G-module W (ψ) coincides with W as a vector space, but G acts by
(σ, w) 7−→ ψ(σ) · σw. Suppose that there is an isomorphism W −→ W (ψ),
                             λ
i.e., an automorphism W −→ W such that λ(σw) = ψ(σ) · σλ(w). Then λ
can be considered as an element of Endker ψ (W ). As ker ψ contains G◦ , the
automorphism λ can also be considered as an element of EndG◦ (W ).
     This implies that EndG◦ (W ) 6= EndG (W ), contradicting the previous
corollary.
     If W is not irreducible, it should be semi-simple anyway, so its irreducible
summands are motivic, implying the Corollary. ⊓       ⊔


4.3 Non-compactness of supports of matrix coefficients

A matrix coefficient of a smooth representation W of a topological group is
a function on the group of type hσw, wi
                                     e for a vector w ∈ W and a vector w e
in the dual representation with open stabilizer.
Proposition 4.6. Suppose that n < ∞, a subgroup H of G contains G◦ and
the supports of the matrix coefficients of a representation of H are compact.
Then this representation is zero.
Proof. Let C be an algebraically closed extension of k of cardinality strictly
greater than the cardinality of k. Let ω 6= 0 be an irreducible representation
of H over C with compact supports of the matrix coefficients. We may
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of ﬁelds                  35


replace H by G◦ , and replace ω by an irreducible subquotient of ω|G◦ . Let
N be a compact open subgroup in G◦ such that ω(hN ) 6= 0.
    Along the same lines as, e.g., in Claim 2.11 of [BZ], one proves the Schur’s
lemma: the endomorphisms of a smooth irreducible C-representation of G◦
are scalar. This allows one to modify Theorem 2.42 a) of [BZ] as follows. For
each open compact subgroup N in G◦ there is an element εω     N ∈ DC such that
ω(εωN ) = ω(h N ) and  π(ε ω
                           N ) = 0 for any smooth  irreducible C-representation
π of G◦ distinct from ω.
    As the G◦ -module F × /k × is irreducible, and EndG◦ (F × /k × ) = Q, the
C-representation π = (F × /k × ) ⊗ C of G◦ is irreducible.10 On the other
hand, the support of the matrix coefficient hσx, wi  e is not compact for any
x ∈ F × /k × − {1} and any vector w    e 6= 0 in the representation dual to π,
since the stabilizer of x is not compact. This implies that there is an element
ε ∈ DC such that ω(ε) = ω(hN ) and π(ε) = 0, contradicting Proposition
4.2. ⊓ ⊔


5 Some examples of (co-)homological calculations

5.1 Examples of Ext-calculation and torsors

Let SmG be the category of smooth G-modules. It is a full abelian subcat-
egory in the category of G-modules.
Proposition 5.1. Let n = ∞ and A be an irreducible commutative alge-
braic group over k.
    Then Ext1SmG (A(F )Q , Q) = Ext1G,cont (A(F )Q , Q) = 0.
Proof. Let 0 −→ Q −→ E −→ A(F )Q −→ 0 be a continuous extension,
                                                                    s
i.e., with closed stabilizers.
                           L   A choice of a linear section A(F )Q ֒→ E de-
fines a splitting E ∼= Q A(F )Q as a Q-vector space. The G-action is
given by σ(b, x) = (b + aσ (x), σx), where aσ (x + y) = aσ (x) + aσ (y) and
aσ (τ x) + aτ (x) = aστ (x). E is continuous if and only if the subgroup
{σ ∈ Stabx | aσ (x) = 0} is closed for any x ∈ A(F )Q . In particular, the
            a(x)
map Stabx −→ Q given by σ 7−→ aσ (x) is a homomorphism with closed
kernel. As a(x) is continuous, the image of any compact subgroup of Uk(x)
is a compact subgroup in Q, i.e., 0. By Lemma 2.8, the subgroup gener-
ated by compact subgroups is dense in Uk(x) , so Uk(x) is in the kernel of
a(x), and thus, a(x) factors through Stabx /Uk(x) ⊆ A(k)tors . Since any
homomorphism from any torsion group to Q is zero, we get aσ (x) = 0
for any σ ∈ Stabx , and therefore, Stab(b,y) = Staby for any (b, y) ∈ E.
This implies also that for any y ∈ A(F )Q , any τ ∈ G and any σ ∈ Staby
one has aτ σ (y) = aτ (y). In particular, if x is a generic point of A and
H = {τ ∈ G | τ x = µ · x for some µ ∈ Q× }, then a(x) : H −→ Q factors
10
    Variant: F/k is an irreducible G◦ -module, DQ ֒→ Endk (F/k), EndG◦ (F/k) =
k, and therefore, (F/k) ⊗k C is an irreducible C[G◦ ]-module.
36                                                                       M.Rovinsky


through Q× −→ Q and p · aτ (x) + aσ (x) = aτ σ (x) for any σ, τ ∈ G such
that σx = p · x and τ x = q · x for some p, q ∈ Q× . Then aσ (x) = (p − 1) · c(x)
for some c(x) ∈ Q. Clearly, c(m · x) = m · c(x) for any m ∈ Q× .
    Note, that c( ) is linear on the set of generic points of A. Indeed, if
                                                          /k
x and y (considered as embeddings x, y : k(A) ֒→ F ) are algebraically
independent over k (i.e., k(x, y) := x(k(A))y(k(A)) ⊂ F is of transcendence
degree 2 dim A over k) then there is an element σ ∈ G such that σx = 2 · x
and σy = 2·y, so aσ (x) = c(x), aσ (y) = c(y), and aσ (x+y) = c(x+y), so, by
additivity of aσ , one has c(x + y) = c(x) + c(y). In general, for any collection
of generic points x1 , . . . , xN there is some z ∈ A(F ) such that the subfield
k(z, x1 , . . . , xN ) of F is of transcendence degree dim A over k(x1 , . . . , xN ).
                                    P                         PN
By induction on N , one has N         j=1 mj · c(xj ) = c(z +      mj · xj ) − c(z).
                      PN                                  PN j=1
In particular, if j=1 mj · xj = 0 this means that j=1 mj · c(xj ) = 0. This
implies that c( ) extends to a linear functional on A(F )Q .
    Subtracting the coboundary of c( ), we may assume that aσ (y) = 0 for
any generic point y ∈ A(F ) and any σ ∈ G such that σy = µ · y for some
µ ∈ Q× .
    Fix a generic point y ∈ A(F ). Any G-equivariant section over the subset
                                              αy,b
of generic points of A is of type σy 7−→ σ(b, y) for some b ∈ Q. As G
acts transitively on the set of generic points of A, and the stabilizers of
vectors in E coincide with the stabilizers of their projections to A(F )Q , this
section is well-defined. For any µ ∈ Q× let τµ ∈ G be such an element that
τµ y = µ · y. Then αy,b (µ · σy) = αy,b (στµ y) = στµ αy,b (y) = στµ (b, y) =
(b + aστµ (y), στµ y) = (b + aσ (τµ y), στµ y) = µ · (b/µ + aσ (y), σy), since
aτµ (y) = 0, so αy,b (µ · x) = µ · αy,b (x) for any generic point x ∈ A(F )
and any µ ∈ Q× if and only if b = 0, i.e., αy,0 is the unique G-equivariant
homogeneous (but, a priori, non-linear) section over the subset of generic
points of A. As ασy,0 is also a G-equivariant homogeneous section over
the subset of generic points of A for arbitrary σ ∈ G, one has αy,0 (σy) =
(aσ (y), σy) = ασy,0 (σy) = (0, σy), so aσ (y) = 0 for any σ ∈ G and any
generic point y. Since any element of A(F )Q is a sum of generic points of
A, we get aσ (z) = 0 for any σ ∈ G and any z ∈ A(F )Q . ⊓        ⊔

Corollary 5.2. Let n = ∞ and A be an irreducible commutative algebraic
group over k. Then one has

           Ext1SmG (WA , Q) = Ext1G,cont (WA , Q) = Hom(A(k), Q).

Proof. The functor RHom(−, Q) applied to 0 −→ A(k)Q −→ A(F )Q −→
WA −→ 0 gives an exact sequence Hom(A(F )Q , Q) −→ Hom(A(k)Q , Q) −→
Ext1 (WA , Q) −→ Ext1 (A(F )Q , Q), where the exterior groups are zero by

Lemma 5.3. Let n = ∞, and either A = Gm , or A = Ga .
  Then Ext1SmG (Q, WA ) = 0.
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of ﬁelds                    37


Proof. Let 0 −→ WA −→ E −→ Q −→ 0 be an exact sequence in SmG . The
stabilizer of an element of E projecting to 1 ∈ Q contains an open subgroup
UL , so E is a sum of WA and a quotient of Q[G/UL ] by a submodule in the
group Q[G/UL ]◦ of degree-zero 0-cycles.
    When restricted to Q[G/UL ]◦ , the projection Q[G/UL ] −→ E factors
through WA . Denote it by α. Fix elements σ, τ ∈ G such that L, σ(L) and
τ σ(L) are in general position, σ|L = τ |L and σ 2 |L = id. Then the generator
[1] − [σ] of Q[G/UL ]◦ is fixed by ULσ(L) , and therefore,

  α([1] − [σ]) = f (x, y) ∈ (A(Lσ(L))/A(k))Q ,
             α([σ] − [τ σ]) = f (y, z) ∈ (A(σ(L)τ σ(L))/A(k)) Q ,
                            α([1] − [τ σ]) = f (x, z) ∈ (A(Lτ σ(L))/A(k))Q ,
where f (−, −) is a rational function and x, y, z denote collections of elements
                                                                              ∂2
in L, σ(L), τ σ(L), respectively. Then f (x, y)+f (y, z) = f (x, z). Taking ∂x∂z
                            ∂       ∂
in the case A = Ga , or ∂x    log · ∂z log in the case A = Gm , we get f (x, z) =
f (x) + g(z). As σ([1] − [σ]) = −([1] − [σ]), one has f (x, y) = −f (y, x), and
thus, f (x, y) = f (x)−f (y) for some f (x) ∈ L. Let β ∈ G be such an element
that βf (x) = 2f (x) (in the sense of the group law of A). Then the image of
2 · [1] − [β] in E is fixed by G and projects to 1 ∈ Q, so E ∼  = Q ⊕ WA . ⊓   ⊔

    It will follow from Propositions 6.4 and 6.15 that Ext1SmG (Q, W ) = 0 for
any admissible representation W of G in the case n = ∞. (More generally,
                        q                           q
if n = ∞, W1 , W2 ∈ IG    and W1 is projective in IG  then, using Lemma 6.6,
we get ExtSmG (W1 , W2 ) = ExtSmG (W1 , W2 ) = Ext1I q (W1 , W2 ) = 0. Now

take q = 0, W1 = Q.)

   In the next example, we wish to show that Ext1SmG (WA , WGm ) 6= 0 for
any abelian variety A over k. The G-module Div◦Q = lim Divalg (YU )Q , intro-

duced before Proposition 3.11, fits into the exact sequence 0 −→ F × /k × −→
Div◦Q −→ Pic◦Q −→ 0. By Proposition 3.11, any non-zero element of A∨ (k)Q
determines an embedding of WA into Pic◦Q , thus inducing an extension of
WA by WGm inside Div◦Q . This extension is non-split, since any generic
F -point x of A, considered as an element of A(F )Q , identifies the space
HomG (A(F )Q , Div◦Q ) with a subspace in (Div◦Q )Stabx which is the same as

    For a smooth G-group A denote by HSm        (G, A) the set of isomorphism
classes of smooth G-torsors under A, i.e., the set of classes of those G-torsors
in H 1 (G, A) that become trivial on an open subgroup of G.
    In particular, H 1 (G, GLr F ) is the set of isomorphism classes of semi-
                                                            1
linear r-dimensional representations of G over F , and HSm      (G, GLr F ) is its
subset of smooth ones.

Proposition 5.4. If n = ∞ then HSm (G, A(F )) = {∗} for any algebraic
group A over k.

                                                        1
Proof. For any 1-cocycle (aσ ) presenting a class in HSm  (G, A(F )) there is
an extension L of k in F of finite type such that aξ = 1 for any ξ ∈ UL ,
so, as aστ = aσ · σaτ , a is a function on G/UL , and aσ ∈ A(Lσ(L)) for any
σ ∈ G.
                    /k
     For any τ : L ֒→ F in general position with respect to L there is some
       /k
σ : L ֒→ F such that σ(L) and στ (L) are in general position with respect to
L. Set F ′ = σ(L)τ (L)στ (L) ⊂ F . There is an F ′ -subalgebra R of finite type
                                                                            T
in LF ′ ⊂ F with the fraction field LF ′ such that the fraction field of R L
coincides with L and aσ , aτ , aστ ∈ A(R). There is a ring homomorphism
    s                                                            T
R −→ F ′ identical on F ′ and inducing a homomorphism R L −→ k, so
s(aξ ) ∈ A(ξ(L)) if ξ ∈ {σ, τ, στ }.
    Clearly, σaτ ∈ A(F ′ ), so s(aστ ) = s(aσ · σaτ ) = s(aσ ) · σaτ , and thus,
aτ = σ −1 s(aσ )−1 · σ −1 s(aστ ). This implies that aτ = fσ−1 · τ fστ , where
fξ := ξ −1 s(aξ ) ∈ A(L) and ξ ∈ {σ, στ }.
                                     /k
     In other words, for any τ : L ֒→ F in general position with respect to L
                                                                    /k
there exist gτ , hτ ∈ A(L) such that aτ = gτ · τ hτ . Any σ : L ֒→ F in general
                                                               /k
position with respect to L can be extended to Lτ (L) ֒→ F in such a way
that L, σ(L) and στ (L) will be in general position, so gσ−1 · aστ · στ h−1
                                                                         τ  =
σhσ · σgτ is an element of A(Lστ (L)) and simultaneously of A(σ(L)), i.e.,
                                    /k
hσ · gτ ∈ A(k) for any σ, τ : L ֒→ F in general position with respect to L.
This means that hσ = bσ · f and gτ = f −1 · cτ , where bσ , cτ ∈ A(k) and
f ∈ A(L), so aτ = f −1 · cτ bτ · τ f .
    For any ξ ∈ G there exist σ and τ in general position with respect to L
such that ξ = στ , and therefore, aξ = (f −1 · cσ bσ · σf ) · σ(f −1 · cτ bτ · τ f ) =
f −1 · (cσ bσ cτ bτ ) · στ f = f −1 · dξ · ξf for some dξ ∈ A(k), which means that
                                                                1
the 1-cocycle (aξ ) is cohomological to the image in HSm           (G, A(F )) of an
                 1
element of HSm (G, A(k)) = HomSm (G, A(k)), trivial by Theorem 2.9. ⊓               ⊔

     Remarks. 1. If n < ∞ then there exist uncountably many semi-linear
smooth representations of G over F of any finite dimension. Namely, any
extension of coefficients from Q to F of a non-trivial finite-dimensional
smooth Q-representations of G gives such semi-linear representations of G.
(In fact, the natural map H 1 (G, A(k)) −→ H 1 (G, A(F )) is injective for
any algebraic group A over k. Otherwise, for a pair of 1-cocycles (aσ ) and
(a′σ ) on G with values in A(k) there would exist such B ∈ A(F ) that
σB = aσ · B · a′σ −1 . If f (B) 6∈ k for some f ∈ k(A) defined at B then there
is σ ∈ G sending f (B) out of the field of definition of B, so σB 6= A · B · A′
for any A, A′ ∈ A(k). ⊓    ⊔)

it is clear, that there are no non-zero 1-forms invariant under all such σ’s,
so ψ = 0, and thus, τ ω/ω ∈ k for any τ ∈ G◦ . However, it is not the case if

5.2 An example of H0 -calculation

Lemma 5.5. Let n = ∞, X a smooth projective variety over k, A an irre-
ducible commutative algebraic group over k, and either W = CH0 (XF )0Q , or
W = A(F )Q . Then for any open subgroup UL in G one has H0 (UL , W ) = 0.

Proof. Let K be the function field of X, or of A. The embeddings σ : K ֒→ F
over k, in general position with respect to L (i.e., with tr.deg(σ(K)L/L) =
tr.deg(K/k)), form a single UL -orbit. By Corollary 3.5, for any generic point
       /k
w : K ֒→ F in general position with respect to L the Q-space W is generated
by τ w − w for all τ ∈ UL , so H0 (UL , W ) = 0. ⊓

6 The category IG

Lemma 6.1. Let W be a Ssmooth representation of G, and L be an extension
of k in F . Then W UL = L0 ⊆L W UL0 , where L0 runs over extensions of k
of finite type.

Proof. For any w ∈ W UL there is an extension L1 of k of finite type such
that w ∈ W UL1 , so w ∈ W H , where H = hUL , UL1 i.
   Consider first the case tr.deg(L/k) < ∞. Let L2 be generatedTover L1
by a transcendence basis of L over k. Then H ⊇ hUL , UL2 i and L2 L = L.
One has the following evident inclusions UL ⊆ hUL , UL2 i =: H ′ ⊆ UL2 T L .
Consider the quotients H ′ /UL = hGal(L/L), UL2 /UL2 L i and UL2 T L /UL =
          T
Gal(L/L2 L).
                                                      T Chapter VIII, §1,
   By the standard Galois theory (e.g., S.Lang, Algebra,
Theorem 4), UL2 /UL2 L = Gal(L2 L/L2 ) ∼  = Gal(L/L2 L).
                                          T                            T
   According to Lemma 2.1, hGal(L/L2 L), Gal(L/L)i = Gal(L/L2 L),
so H ′ /UL = ULT2 T L /UL , and therefore, H ′ = UL2 T L . Finally, H ⊇ UL0 ,
where L0 = L2 L.
   Now consider the case tr.deg(L/k) = ∞. The group H contains the sub-
group hUL , UL1 i, which coincides, by Proposition 2.14, with UL T L1 . Let
                                                              T
L2 be generated over L1 by a transcendence basis S of L1 L over k (in
40                                                                                 M.Rovinsky


particular, L2 ⊂ L1 ). Then T  one has embeddings
                                        T           L1 ⊆ L2 ⊆ L1 ,TandTthere-
fore, L1 = L2 , and thus, L1 L = L2 L. Similarly, k(S) ⊆ L2 L L1 ⊆
  T                        T T              T          T T
L L1 , and therefore, L2 (L L1 ) = L L1 = L2 (L L1 ). By Propo-
sition 2.14, this implies that hUL2 , UL T L1 i = UL2 T L T L1 , so H contains
                        T
UL3 , where L3 = L2 L. Let L4 be the minimal Gal(L/L)-invariant ex-
tension of L3 . As L3 is a subfield of L Tfinitely generated
                                                          T over k, L4 is an
extension of finite type of L3 . Then L4 L = L4 = L4 L, so by Proposi-
                                              T       Gal(L/L)
tion 2.14, hUL , UL4 i = UL0 , where L0 = L4 L = L4             .
    Finally, H ⊇ UL0 , where L0 is a subfield of L of finite type over k. ⊓⊔

Corollary 6.2. Let W be a smooth representation of G such that W UL1 =
W UL1 (t) for any extension L1 of k of finite type and any t ∈ F − L1 . Then
W UL = W UL′ for any extension L of k and any purely transcendental ex-
tension L′ of L.
                                    S
Proof. By Lemma 6.1, W UL′ = L0 ⊆L′ W UL0 , where L0 runs over exten-
sions of k of finite type. Let L′ = L(x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . ) for some x1 , x2 , x3 , . . .
algebraically independent over L. Each L0 of this type is a subfield in
                                  ⊆ L of finite type
L1 (x1 , . . . , xN ) for some L1 S                    S over k and some inte-
ger N ≥ 0. Then W UL′ = L0 ⊆L′ W UL0 ⊆ L1 ⊆L W UL1 = W UL , so
W UL′ = W UL . ⊓       ⊔

Lemma 6.3. Let F ′ $ F be an algebraically closed extension of k. Suppose
that W UF ′ = W UF ′ (x) for a smooth representation W of G and some x ∈
F − F ′ . Then W UL = W UL(x) for any extension L of k inside F ′ .

Proof. Fix a transcendence basis S of F ′ over L and set L1 = L(S).
   As the group UL1 is an extension of GF ′ /L1 by GF/F ′ , and UL1 (x) is an
extension of the group GF ′ (x)/L1 (x) = GF ′ /L1 by GF/F ′ (x) , one has
                            GF ′ /L1                    GF ′ (x)/L1 (x)
       W UL1 = W GF/F ′                 = W GF/F ′ (x)                      = W UL1 (x) .

   For any y ∈ S ∪ {x} there is σ ∈ UL inducing a permutation of S ∪ {x}
that transforms (S ∪ {x}) − {y} to S. Such σ induces an automorphism of
W UL1 (x) transforming W UL((S∪{x})−{y}) to W UL1 , and therefore, the latter
two spaces coincide.
   This implies that W UL1 is fixed by the subgroup of G generated by
UL((S∪{x})−{y}) for all y ∈ S ∪ {x}. By Lemma 2.16, this subgroup is dense
in UL , and therefore, W UL1 = W UL . ⊓ ⊔

    Let IG be the full subcategory in SmG consisting of those represen-
tations W of G for which W GF/L = W GF/L′ for any extension L of k in
F and any purely transcendental extension L′ of L in F . For each integer
             q
q ≥ 0 let IG   be the full subcategory in IG consisting of those representa-
tions W of G for which W GF/F ′ = 0 for any algebraically closed F ′ with
tr.deg(F ′ /k) = q − 1.

Proposition 6.4. Any admissible representation of G is an object in IG if
n = ∞.
Proof. Let W be an admissible representation of G, L an extension of k in
F of finite type and x, y ∈ F are algebraically independent over L. Then
the finite-dimensional space W UL is included into the finite-dimensional
spaces W UL(x) and W UL(y) ; and the latter ones are included into the finite-
dimensional space W UL(x,y) . As the group UL(x+y,xy) is an extension of the
group {1, α} = Gal(L(x, y)/L(x + y, xy)) (so αx = y and αy = x) by
                                          hαi
UL(x,y), one has W UL(x+y,xy) = W UL(x,y)      . As the subgroups UL(x+y,xy)
and UL(x,y) are conjugated in G, the spaces W UL(x+y,xy) and W UL(x,y) are
of the same dimension. This implies that W UL(x+y,xy) = W UL(x,y) , and thus,
α acts trivially on W UL(x,y) .
    Notice, however, that α permutes W UL(x) and W UL(y) , so W UL(x) =
   UL(y)
W        . By Lemma 2.16, the group generated by UL(x) and UL(y) is dense
in UL , and therefore, W UL = W UL(x) . ⊓⊔
Corollary 6.5. The category of admissible representations of G over E is
abelian. It is closed under extensions in SmG (E).
Proof. It suffices to check that for any short exact sequence
                          0 −→ W1 −→ W2 −→ W3 −→ 0
of representations of G with admissible W2 the representations W1 and W3
of G are also admissible. For any subextension L of finite type over k and a
transcendence basis t1 , t2 , t3 , . . . of F over L set L′ = L(t1 , t2 , t3 , . . . ). Then
                        U                 U          U
the sequence 0 −→ W1 L′ −→ W2 L′ −→ W3 L′ −→ 0 is exact. If n < ∞,
we can assume that F = L. As W2 ∈ IG (E) in the case n = ∞, the middle
term coincides with W2UL , which is a finite-dimensional space, and therefore,
                    U                 U
so are the terms W1 L′ and W3 L′ , containing W1UL and W3UL , respectively.
This implies that W1 and W3 are admissible. ⊓           ⊔

   Remark. If n = ∞, the category of smooth representations of G has
such disadvantage that it has no non-zero projective objects.
   Proof. Let W be a projective object in the category of smooth E-
representations of G. Choose a system of generators {ej }j∈J of W . This
determines a surjection
                           M              π
                              E[G/ULj ] −→ W,
                                j∈J

where ULj ⊆ Stabej . Fix an element i0 ∈ J and for each j ∈ J fix
an extension L′j of Lj such that tr.deg(L′j /k) > tr.deg(L L i0 /k). As W is
projective, the composition of π with the surjection           j∈J E[G/UL′j ] −→
L                                                                L
  j∈J E[G/U   Lj ] splits, and therefore, there is an element in    j∈J E[G/ULj ]
                                                                               ′

                                                                 ULi
with the same stabilizer as ei0 . However, as E[G/UL′j ]             0   = 0, this implies
that ei0 = 0, and thus, W = 0. ⊓   ⊔

    {IG }q≥0 is a decreasing filtration of the category IG by Serre subcate-

Proof. By definition, the functors H 0 (GF/L , −) and H 0 (GF/L′ , −) coincide
on IG for any purely transcendental extension L′ of L. The group GF/L′ is
compact, if F is algebraic over L′ , so H 0 (GF/L′ , −) is exact on SmG , and
thus, its restriction to IG is also exact.

Lemma 6.7. If F ′ is a subfield in F with tr.deg(F ′ /k) = ∞ then the func-
tor H 0 (GF/F ′ , −) from SmG to SmGF ′ /k is an equivalence of categories (in-
ducing an equivalence of IG and IGF ′ /k ). The functor H 0 (GF/K , −) from
SmG to VectQ is exact if and only if tr.deg(K/k) = tr.deg(F/k)(≤ ∞).
                                                     ∼
Proof. There exists a field isomorphism ϕ : F −→ F ′ identical on k. Then
                                                             ∼
ϕ induces an isomorphism of topological groups GF ′ /k −→ G by τ 7−→
ϕ−1 τ ϕ and an equivalence of the categories of representations of G and
representations of GF ′ /k by π 7−→ ϕ∗ π, where ϕ∗ π(τ ) = π(ϕ−1 τ ϕ).
    For any subfield L ⊂ F finitely generated over k there exists an element
σ ∈ G such that σ|L = ϕ|L . Let W be a smooth representation of G. Then ϕ
                                            ∼
and σ induce the same isomorphism W UL −→ W Uσ(L) = W Uϕ(L) . Passing to
                                                                 ∼     G
the direct limit with respect to L, we get an isomorphism W −→ W F/F ′ .
For any τ ∈ GF ′ /k and any w ∈ W one has ϕπ(ϕ−1 τ ϕ)w = τ ϕw (since ϕ
                                            G
is a limit of elements of G), i.e., ϕ∗ π ∼
                                         = W F/F ′ .
    Now, if tr.deg(K/k) = ∞, then H 0 (GF/K , −) is the composition of exact
functors H 0 (GF/K , −) and H 0 (Gal(K/K), −). Otherwise, if tr.deg(K/k) <
tr.deg(L/k), then the only GF/K -invariant element in Q[G/UL ] is zero, so
H 0 (GF/K , −) transforms the surjection Q[G/UL ] −→ Q to 0 −→ Q. ⊓     ⊔

6.1 The functor I

For a representation M of G define Nj M as the subspace generated by the
invariants M GF/Fj for S
                       all subfields Fj ⊆ F with tr.deg(Fj /k) = j. Clearly,
Nj M ⊆ Nj+1 M , M = j≥0 Nj M if M is smooth,

 – Nj M is the subrepresentation M of G in M generated by M GF/Fj for
   some algebraically closed Fj ,
 – restriction to Nj M of each G-homomorphism M −→ M ′ factors through
   Nj M ′ ;
 – Ni+j (M1 ⊗ M2 ) ⊇ Ni M1 ⊗ Nj M2 .

Proposition 6.8. For any object W ∈ SmG and any integer q ≥ 0 there
                         q
is its quotient I q W ∈ IG such that any G-homomorphism from W to an
           q                                               q  Iq
object of IG factors through I q W . The functor12 SmG −→ IG given by
         q                       q
W 7−→ I W is right exact and I W = IW/Nq−1 IW .
                      q                               α
Proof. Let W ′ ∈ IG     . Any G-homomorphism W −→ W ′ factors through
                                 q
α(W ), which is an object in IG    , so we may assume that α is surjective.
Let L be an extension of k in F and L′ a purely transcendental exten-
sion of L in F over which F is algebraic. As the functor H 0 (UL′ , −) is
exact on SmG , the morphism α induces a surjection W UL′ −→ (W ′ )UL′ . As
(W ′ )UL = (W ′ )UL′ , the subgroup UL acts trivially on (W ′ )UL′ , and there-
fore, the subrepresentation WL = hσw − w | σ ∈ UL , w ∈ W UL′ iG of G is
in the kernel of α (it is independent of L′ as all possible L′ form a single
UL -orbit and στ w − τ w = (στ )w − w − (τ w − w) for any τ ∈ UL and any
w ∈ W UL′ ; moreover, WL dependsP     only on the G-orbit of L). This implies
that α factors through IW := W/ L WL .
    The representation IW of G is smooth, so the map W UL′ −→ (IW )UL′
induced by the projection is surjective, and therefore, one can lift any ele-
ment w ∈ (IW )UL′ to an element w ∈ W UL′ . Then σw−w coincides with the
projection of σw − w for any σ ∈ UL . Note, that σw − w ∈ WL , so its projec-
tion is zero, and therefore, σw = w for any σ ∈ UL . As (IW )UL ⊆ (IW )UL′ ,
this means that (IW )UL = (IW )UL′ , and thus, IW ∈ IG .
    We may further suppose that W ∈ IG . As Nq−1 W ′ = 0 and Nq−1 is
                                               α
functorial, Nq−1 W is in the kernel of W −→ W ′ , so α factors through
I q W := W/Nq−1 W .
    As the functor H 0 (GF/F ′ , −) is exact on IG , one has a short exact
sequence

          0 −→ (Nq−1 W )GF/F ′ −→ W GF/F ′ −→ (I q W )GF/F ′ −→ 0,

where (Nq−1 W )GF/F ′ = W GF/F ′ for any algebraically closed F ′ of transcen-
                                                                 q
dence degree q − 1 over k, so (I q W )GF/F ′ = 0, i.e., I q W ∈ IG .

   As HomIGq (I q W, W ′ ) = HomSmG (W, W ′ ) for any W ∈ SmG and W ′ ∈
 q                                                     q
IG ,i.e., I q is left adjoint to the identity functor IG ֒→ SmG , it is right
exact (cf., e.g., [GM], Chapter II, §6.20). ⊓ ⊔

    Example. Let A be a one-dimensional group scheme over k, m ≥ 1 an
integer, and W = Nq W be a smooth representation of G, where q ≤ n − 1.
Then I(S m A(F ) ⊗ W ) = 0 if either m is even, or if A = Ga , or if A = Gm .
                                                       VN
In particular, the natural projection A(F )⊗NQ    −→       A(F )Q induces an
                       ⊗N         V N
isomorphism I(A(F )Q ) −→ I(          A(F )Q ) if n ≥ N − 1.
    Proof. For any vector space V and its proper subspace V ′ the space
S m V is spanned by the elements x⊗m for all x ∈ V − V ′ , so S m A(F ) ⊗
W is spanned by the elements x⊗m ⊗ w for all w ∈ W with Stabw ⊇
Uk′ , tr.deg(k ′ /k) < q + 1, and all x ∈ A(F ) − A(k ′ ). If m is even then
the stabilizer of such x⊗m ⊗ w contains the group {σ ∈ Uk′ | σx = ±x},
which contains the subgroup Uk′ (t) for an element t ∈ k(x) := x(k(A)) with
quadratic extension k(x)/k(t). If A is rational then the stabilizer of x⊗m ⊗w
contains the subgroup Uk′ (x) . This implies that the image of x⊗m ⊗ w in
I(S m A(F ) ⊗ W ) spans a trivial subrepresentation of Uk′ . On the other
hand, as n ≥ q + 1 > tr.deg(k ′ /k), there is σ ∈ Uk′ such that σx = 2 · x,
and thus, σ(x⊗m ⊗ w) = 2m · (x⊗m ⊗ w), which means that this trivial
subrepresentation of Uk′ is zero, so I(S m A(F ) ⊗ W ) = 0. ⊓  ⊔

   Remark. I is not left exact, e.g., it transforms the injection k ֒→ F to
k −→ 0.

Conjecture 6.9. If n = ∞ then for any j ≥ 0 and any object W of IG the
G-module grjN W is semi-simple.

This is evident when j = 0, and deduced easily from Corollary 6.22 when
j = 1.

Corollary 6.10. If n = ∞ and Conjecture 6.9 holds for any 0 ≤ j ≤
q − 1 then the functor I q is exact on IG . This is equivalent to the strict
compatibility of the filtration N0 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Nq−1 with morphisms in IG .
                       α        β
Proof. Let 0 −→ W1 −→ W2 −→ W3 −→ 0 be a short exact sequence in
IG . Then the first term of the induced exact sequence
             \
  0 −→ (W1 Nq−1 W2 )/Nq−1 W1 −→ I q W1 −→ I q W2 −→ I q W3 −→ 0

measures deviation from the strict compatibility of Nq−1 with the morphism
α.
    To show that the filtration N• on objects of IT  G is strictly compati-
ble with the morphisms, i.e., ϕ(Nj W1 ) = ϕ(W1 ) Nj W2 for any mor-
            ϕ
phism W1 −→ W2 in IG , we proceed by induction on j ≥ 0. This is
                                           G     ′
clear when j = 0. By Lemma 6.6, ϕ(W1 F/F ) = ϕ(W1 )GF/F ′ for any
          ′               ′
subfield F with tr.deg(F /k) = j, so ϕ(Nj W1 ) = Nj ϕ(W1 ), and thus,

we may further suppose that ϕ is an embedding: WT1 ⊂ W2 . Suppose
       T                                      W   N W
that W1 Nj W2 6= Nj W1 . Replace W1 by W1′ := 1Nj Wj1 2 and W2 by
       Nj W2
W2′ := Nj W1 . Then 0 6=   W1′ ⊂ W2′ = Nj W2′ and Nj W1′ = 0. (By Proposition

6.8, W1′ ⊆ I j+1 W1 , so   by Lemma 6.6, W1′ ∈ IG   , which is equivalent to
Nj W1′ = 0.)
   The induction assumption excludes the case W1′ ⊆ Nj−1 W2′ , so we may
                       W′
replace W1′ by W1 := Nj−11W ′ and W2′ by W2 := grjN W2′ . Then 0 =

                                                             ξ
   Assuming Conjecture 6.9, there is a morphism W2 −→ W1 splitting the
embedding W1 ⊂ W2 . However, ξ(W2 ) = ξ(Nj W2 ) ⊆ Nj W1 = 0, leading to
contradiction. ⊓

[UL1 (x) ] ∈ WL1 ⊂ Q[G/UL1 (x) ] (see definition of I in the proof of Propo-

an isomorphism CL1 (x) −→ CL1 .

Proposition 6.15. IG (E) is a Serre subcategory in SmG (E) if n = ∞.
Proof. By Lemma 6.6, the category IG (E) is closed under taking subquo-
tients in SmG (E), so we have only to check that it is closed under extensions
in SmG (E).
    Let 0 −→ W1 −→ W −→ W2 −→ 0 be an extension in SmG (E) with
W1 , W2 ∈ IG (E). By Corollary 6.2 and Lemma 6.3, it suffices to check that
W UL = W UL′ for any extension L of k in F of finite type and a purely
transcendental extension L′ of L with L′ = F . As the functor H 0 (UL′ , −) =
HomSmU ′ (E) (E, −) is exact on SmG (E) and W1 , W2 ∈ IG (E), this is equiv-
         L
alent to the vanishing of Ext1SmU (E) (E, −) on IG (E). As the forgetful func-
                                     L
tor SmG (E) −→ SmUL (E) induces IG (E) −→ IUL (E), one can replace k
with L and then it remains to show the vanishing of Ext1SmG (E) (E, −) on
IG (E).
    Let 0 −→ W1 −→ W −→ E −→ 0 be an extension in SmG (E) with
W1 ∈ IG (E). Choose some e ∈ W projecting to 1 ∈ E. The stabilizer
of e contains an open subgroup UL . Fix a maximal purely transcendental
extension L′ P of k in L. Let L′′ be a Galois extension of L′ containing L.
          1
Then [L′′ :L′ ] σ∈Gal(L′′ /L′ ) σe is fixed by UL′ and projects to 1 ∈ E, so W
is a sum of W1 and a quotient of E[G/UL′ ]. Restriction to E[G/UL′ ]◦ of
the projection E[G/UL′ ] −→ W factors through W1 which is an object in
IG (E).
    Let σ ∈ G be such an element that L′ and σ(L′ ) are in general position
and σ 2 |L′ = id. Then [1] − [σ] is a generator of E[G/UL′ ]◦ , so there is
a surjection E[G/UL′ σ(L′ ) ] −→ E[G/UL′ ]◦ sending [τ ] to [τ ] − [τ σ], and
therefore, a surjection E = CL′ σ(L′ ) ⊗ E −→ IE[G/UL′ ]◦ . However, σ
changes sign of the generator [1]−[σ] of E[G/UL′ ]◦ , and thus, IE[G/UL′ ]◦ =
0. This means that the projection E[G/UL′ ] −→ W factors through E, i.e.,
W ∼ = W1 ⊕ E. ⊓   ⊔

Conjecture 6.16. If n = ∞ then CH0 (XF )Q = Ck(X) for any smooth irre-
ducible proper variety X over k.

Remark. This is true, by Corollary 6.21 and Lemma 6.12, if k(X) is uni-
rational over a one-dimensional field. Another example is given by k(X) =
                        2     m          Pm
k(x1 , . . . , xm )he1 e2 ···em i , where j=1 xdj = 1, m is odd and d ∈ {m+1, m+2},
ei xj = ζ δij · xj for a primitive dth root of unity ζ. (The proof is the same
as for CH0 (X) = Z.)

Proposition 6.17. If n = ∞ then for any irreducible variety X over k
                              /k
the kernel of Q[{k(X) ֒→ F }] −→ Ck(X) is the sum over all curves y ∈
(k(X) ⊗k F )1 of subspaces spanned by those linear combinations of generic
(with respect to a field of definition of y) F -points of {y} that are linearly
equivalent to zero on any compactification of {y}.

Proof. Let H be the set of algebraically closed extensions F∞ of k in F such
that tr.deg(F/F∞ ) = 1. Set hK := hUK . By Lemma 6.3 and Corollary 6.2,
the kernel ∞ W of W −→ IW coincides with
    X
        hσw − w | w ∈ W GF/F∞ (t) , σ ∈ GF/F∞ , t ∈ F − F∞ iQ
  F∞ ∈H
             X
       =           hσhF∞ (t) w − hF∞ (t) w | w ∈ W, σ ∈ GF/F∞ , t ∈ F − F∞ iQ .
           F∞ ∈H

   If W = Q[G/UL ] this is the same as
      X                                    /k
             hσhF∞ (t) ξ − hF∞ (t) ξ | ξ : L ֒→ F, σ ∈ GF/F∞ , t ∈ F − F∞ iQ .
     F∞ ∈H

We may suppose that in this sum ξ(L) 6⊂ F∞ , as otherwise σhF∞ (t) ξ −
hF∞ (t) ξ = 0. Then the pair (ξ, F∞ ) determines the F∞ -curve C F∞ ,ξ :=

σhF∞ (t) ξ − hF∞ (t) ξ is an F -divisor on C F∞ ,ξ , which is a linear combination

Now one can rewrite σhF∞ (t) ξ − hF∞ (t) ξ as β∗ T ∗ div( TT−σt

of the model of Cp over F0 , it follows from Proposition 6.20 that f is sent

6.2 Objects of IG of level 1

For a subfield L in F of finite type over k denote by Z0rat (L ⊗k F ) the kernel
of the natural projection Q[G/UL ] −→ CH0 (XF )Q for a smooth proper
model X of L over k.                               L
    For any W ∈ SmG one has a surjection                 G

where F ′ is an algebraically closed extension of k in F with tr.deg(F ′ /k) = 1.
This means that to describe the objects of IG of level 1 it suffices to treat the
case W = heiG , where Stabe ⊇ UL with L ∼     = k(X) for a smooth projective
curve X over k of genus g ≥ 0. Then W is dominated by CL . Let JX be the
Jacobian of X.

that the classes of γ1 + i=1 κi1 , . . . , γs + i=1 κis in Picg+1 X are generic

Lemma 6.19. The images of the generators wN = j=1 σj − j=1 τj of
Z0rat (L ⊗k F ) (from Lemma 6.18) in W := IZ0rat (L ⊗k F ) are fixed by G.
Proof. Set M := N + g. Then for any generic point γ of PicM (XF ) in
general position with respect to σ1 , . . . , σN , τ1 , . . . , τN there is a collection
α1 , . . . , αg of generic points of XF , also in general position with respect to

σ1 , . . . , σN , τ1 , . . . , τN , such that the class of j=1 σj + j=1 αj coincides
with γ.
     There exists an M -tuple ξ = (ξ1 , . . . , ξM ) of generic points such that
both 2M -tuples (σ1 , . . . , σN , α1 , . . . , αg ; ξ) and (τ1 , . . . , τN , α1 , . . . , αg ; ξ) are
                                                       −1
generic points of the irreducible variety pM              (0).
     The subfields
 Lξ := (ξ1 (L) · · · ξM (L))SM ,          Lσ := (σ1 (L) · · · σN (L)α1 (L) · · · αg (L))SM
are isomorphic to the function field of the M th symmetric power of X, and
                                                                    −1
Lσ Lξ is isomorphic to the function field of the SM \pM                (0)/SM . As M th
symmetric power of X is birational to the product of the Jacobian of X
and a projective space, the subfields Lξ , Lσ , as well as Lσ Lξ , are purely
transcendental extensions of the subfield γ(k(PicM (X))) in F . Clearly, the
same is true for the subfields Lτ := (τ1 (L) · · · τN (L)α1 (L) · · · αg (L))SM and
Lτ Lξ .

   j=1 αj −   j=1 ξj of Z0 (L⊗k F ) are fixed by ULσ Lξ and by ULτ Lξ , respec-
tively. Then the classes of wσ and of wτ in W are fixed by Uγ(k(PicM (X))) ,
and thus, so is their difference wN .
    Fix a purely transcendental extension L0 of k in F with tr.deg(L0 /k) = g
in general position with respect to σ1 , . . . , σN , τ1 , . . . , τN . Then
                                 \
                 L0 =                            γ(k(PicM (X))),
                             γ∈G, γ(k(PicM (X)))⊃L0

so by Lemma 2.1, the subgroup in G generated by Uγ(k(PicM (X))) for such
γ contains UL0 , and thus, the image of wN in W is fixed by UL0 .
   Finally, as W ∈ IG , one has wN ∈ W UL0 = W G . ⊓  ⊔

fixed by G. As (σ1 , . . . , σN ; τ1 , . . . , τN ) and (τ1 , . . . , τN ; σ1 , . . . , σN ) are both
generic points of the irreducible variety p−1          N (0) and the generic points form
a single G-orbit, there is an element β ∈ G such that βσj = τj and βτj = σj

which are fixed by G, we get W = 0. ⊓                ⊔

Corollary 6.21. Let X be a smooth projective curve over k, L = k(X)

Corollary 6.22. If n = ∞ then any object of IG of level 1 is a direct sum
of a trivial module and a quotient of direct sum of modules A(F )Q for some

Proof. By Corollary 6.21, any object W of IG of level 1 is a quotient of
L
   X∈I Pic(XF )Q for a set I of smooth projective curves over k. As there
is a splitting
       L       Pic(XF )Q ∼
                         = Q ⊕ Pic◦ (XF )Q , we get that W is a quotient of
   G
W ⊕ A∈J A(F )Q for a set J of simple abelian varieties over k.
                         G
    In particular, W/W
                    L      is semi-simple, so there is a subset J ′ ⊆ J such

over all quotients of direct sum of modules A(F )Q for some abelian varieties
A over k by a trivial submodule. We may suppose that ϕ’s are surjective.
As Ck(X) is projective, any such ϕ lifts to a homomorphism to the direct
sum of A(F )Q .

so any G-homomorphisms from Ck(X)      to any object of level 1 factors through

points of Y generic with respect to k ′ L. As generic points of Y are generic
                                          /L
points of X, this means that Q[{L(X) ֒→ F }] −→ Ck(X) is surjective. ⊓

   Propositions 6.15 and the following one suggest that the category IG
should be related to the category of effective homological motives.
Proposition 6.26. The inner Hom functor13 on SmG induces the inner
Hom functor on IG if n = ∞. Level of Hom(W1 , W2 ) does not exceed q if
W1 , W2 = Nq W2 ∈ IG and q ≤ 1.
Proof. For any W1 ∈ ILG there is a collection I of irreducible varieties over
k and a surjection of   X∈I Ck(X) onto W1 , and thus, an inclusion of G-
modules                             Y
                 Hom(W1 , W2 ) ֒→       Hom(Ck(X) , W2 ).

Clearly,
  Q      for any collection {Mα }α∈I of objects of IG any smooth submodule
in α∈I Mα is also an object of IG , and thus, to show that Hom(W1 , W2 ) ∈
IG for any W1 , W2 ∈ IG it suffices to check that Hom(W1 , W2 ) ∈ IG for
any W2 ∈ IG and any W1 of type Ck(X) .
   By its definition, Hom(W1 , W2 ) is the union of HomUL (W1 , W2 ) over all
open subgroups UL in G.

tr.deg(F ′ /k) = ∞ and an embedding σ : k(X) ֒→ F in general position

     (W1 , W2 ) 7−→ lim HomU (W1 , W2 ), where U runs over the set of open sub-
                   U→
groups of G. Clearly, HomG (W1 , Hom(W2 , W3 )) = HomG (W1 ⊗ W2 , W3 ) for any
smooth G-modules W1 , W2 , W3 .

module Hom(W1 , W2 )GF/F ′ embeds into the GF ′ /k -module W2 F σ(k(X)) =:
W0 . Here the group GF ′ /k = GF ′ σ(k(X))/σ(k(X)) acts on W0 as the quo-
tient of GF/σ(k(X)) by GF/F ′ σ(k(X)) . Clearly, W0 ∈ IGF ′ /k , so the smooth
GF ′ /k module Hom(W1 , W2 )GF/F ′ belongs to IGF ′ /k . By Lemma 6.7, the
               H 0 (GF/F ′ ,−)
functor SmG −−−−−−−−→ SmGF ′ /k is an equivalence of categories, inducing
an equivalence of IG and IGF ′ /k , so the object Hom(W1 , W2 ) belongs to
IG .
     If W2 is a trivial G-module then Hom(Ck(X) , W2 ) = W2 , so the repre-
sentation Hom(W1 , W2 ) is a submodule of a trivial G-module, and thus,
Hom(W1 , W2 ) is trivial itself.
     To show that Hom(W  L1 , W2 )◦is of level 1, if W
                                                     L2 = N1 W1 , it is sufficient
to treat the case W1 = X∈I Ck(X)        and W2 = ( j∈J Aj (F )Q )/Λ for some
       L
Λ ⊆ j∈J Aj (k)Q . Then, using Corollaries 6.24 and 6.25, we get that

                                 /L
         HomUL (Q[{L(X) ֒→ F }]◦ , W2 ) = HomUL (AlbX(F )Q , W2 ).

As this is independent of L, the G-module Hom(W1 , W2 ) is trivial. ⊓
                                                                    ⊔

   Remark. The G-equivariant pairing Q[G/U ] ⊗ Q[G/U ] −→ Q given
by [σ] ⊗ [τ ] 7−→ 0 if [σ] 6= [τ ] and [σ] ⊗ [σ] 7−→ 1 defines an embedding
of Q[G/U ] into its contragredient, so, unlike the objects of IG in the case
n = ∞, for any 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞ there exist many smooth G-modules with
non-trivial contragredients.


6.4 A tensor structure on IG

As Example after Proposition 6.8 on p.44 shows, IG is not closed under
tensor products in SmG . We define W1 ⊗I W2 by I(W1 ⊗ W2 ).
   This operation is not associative on SmG as one can see from the fol-
lowing example. Let Wj = Q[G/Uj ] for some open subgroups Uj = ULj in
                                                         QN
G, 1 ≤ j ≤ N , N ≥ 2. Then one has W1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ WN = Q[ j=1 G/Uj ] =

   Clearly, the representation Q[G · (τ1 , τ2 , . . . , τN )] is isomorphic to the

representation Q[G/( j=1 τj Uj τj−1 )], so
                                             M
         I(W1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ WN ) ∼

   More symmetrically, W1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ WN ∼

If U1 = U2 = Uk(x) , one has IW1 = IW2 = Q, and therefore, W1 ⊗I (W2 ⊗I
Q) = W1 ⊗I IW2 = IW1 = Q.
    On the other hand, by Noether normalization, (W1 ⊗I W2 ) ⊗I Q =
I(W1 ⊗ W2 ) contains submodules isomorphic to CL for any field L finitely
generated over k and with tr.deg(L/k) = 1.

Lemma 6.27. If n = ∞ then for any finite collection of smooth irreducible
proper k-varieties X1 , . . . , XN there is a canonical surjection of G-modules
                    I(α)                          
Ck(X1 ×k ···×k XN ) −→ I Ck(X1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Ck(XN ) .
   If Ck(X1 ×k ···×k XN ) = CH0 (X1 ×k · · · ×k XN )Q then I(α) is an isomor-
phism.

Proof. It suffices to check that the canonical G-homomorphism Q[{k(X1 )⊗k
                /k         α
· · · ⊗k k(XN ) ֒→ F }] −→ Ck(X1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Ck(XN ) , given by τ −
                                                                  7 → τ |k(X1 ) ⊗
· · · ⊗ τ |k(XN ) , is surjective, and its kernel is contained in the kernel of
                               /k
Q[{k(X1 ) ⊗k · · · ⊗k k(XN ) ֒→ F }] −→ Ck(X1 ×k ···×k XN ) (so that a canonical
G-homomorphism Ck(X1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Ck(XN ) −→ Ck(X1 ×k ···×k XN ) is defined,
and the composition

                        I(α)                          
    Ck(X1 ×k ···×k XN ) −→ I Ck(X1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Ck(XN ) −→ Ck(X1 ×k ···×k XN )

is the identity).
     We have to check that for any collection of generic points σj ∈ Xj ,
1 ≤ j ≤ N , the class σ of σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σN in Ck(X1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Ck(XN ) is a linear
combination of the images of generic points of X1 ×k · · · ×k XN .
     By induction on j we show that σ is a linear combination of elements of
type σ1′ ⊗ · · · ⊗ σN
                    ′
                      , where σ1′ , . . . , σj′ are in general position. For j = 1 there
is nothing to prove. If j > 1 there is a curve Y on Xj defined over a subfield
k ′ ⊂ F with tr.deg(k ′ /k) < ∞ such that σj′ ∈ Y (F )− Y (k ′ ). Clearly, for any
G-module W the canonical G-homomorphism W −→ IW factors through
the GF/k′ -homomorphism W −→ Ik′ W . Here Ik′ : SmGF/k′ −→ IGF/k′
denotes the same functor as I, but in the context of GF/k′ -modules. The
embedding Y ֒→ (Xj )k′ induces the GF/k′ -homomorphism Q[Y (F )] −→
Q[Xj (F )], and therefore, using Corollary 6.21, the GF/k′ -homomorphism
                                                    M
                     Z0 (Yk′ ) ⊕ Pic(YF )Q −→                Ck′ (x) .
                                                 x∈(Xj )k′

                                                                         L
This implies that the image of σj′ ∈ Y (F ) in IQ[Xj (F )] = x∈Xj Ck(x) ,
which is equal to [σj′ ] ∈ Ck(Xj ) , coincides with the image of a linear com-
bination of some generic points of Y that are in general position with re-
spect to σ1′ , . . . , σj−1
                          ′
                             , i.e., of some points of Y (F ) − Y (k ′′ ), where k ′′ =
k ′ σ1′ (k(X1 )) · · · σj−1
                        ′   (k(Xj−1 )). This completes the induction, so we may
suppose that σ1 , . . . , σj are in general position. Then there is some τ :
54                                                                   M.Rovinsky

                            /k
k(X1 ) ⊗k · · · ⊗k k(XN ) ֒→ F such that τ |k(Xj ) = σj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ N , thus
implying that α is surjective.
    Besides, the representation Ck(X1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Ck(XN ) surjects onto the rep-
resentation CH0 ((X1 )F ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ CH0 ((XN )F )Q , and the latter one surjects
onto CH0 ((X1 ×k · · · ×k XN )F )Q = Ck(X1 ×k ···×k XN ) . ⊓⊔

Corollary 6.28. If n = ∞ and Lemma 6.27 is true then ⊗I is associative,
the class of projective objects in IG is stable under ⊗I , and W1 ⊗I · · · ⊗I
WN = I (W1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ WN ).

Proof. By Lemma 6.27, the class of G-modules of type CL is stable under ⊗I ,
and ⊗I is associative on this class. As any projective object is a direct sum-
mand of a direct sum of G-modules of type CL , the same holds for the class
of projective objects in IG , and also W1 ⊗I · · · ⊗I WN = I (W1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ WN )
for projective W1 , . . . , WN .
                                                         αj
    Any object Wj ∈ IG is the cokernel of a map Qj −→ Pj , where Pj and
Qj are direct sums of G-modules of type CL . This implies that Wi ⊗I Wj is
                                           id⊗αj +αi ⊗id
the cokernel of Pi ⊗I Qj ⊕ Qi ⊗I Pj −−−−−−−→ Pi ⊗I Pj , and in general,
(. . . (W1 ⊗I W2 ) ⊗I · · · ) ⊗I WN is the cokernel of

     N                                   P
     M                                       j   id⊗···⊗αj ⊗···⊗id
           I(P1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Qj ⊗ · · · ⊗ PN ) −−−−−−−−−−−−→ I(P1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ PN ).
     j=1


Clearly, this is independent of rearrangements of the brackets. ⊓
                                                                ⊔

     Remarks. 1. As it follows from Example on p.44, The form W1 ⊗W2 −→
W1 ⊗I W2 can be degenerate. (If W1 = E(F )Q for an elliptic curve E over
k, and W2 = W1 /Λ for some subspace 0 6= Λ ⊆ E(k)Q then W1 ⊗I W1 =
   V2
I( W1 ) surjects onto W1 ⊗I W2 with kernel dominated by W1 ⊗ Λ. As
the form is skew-symmetric, when lifted to W1 ⊗ W1 , its left kernel contains
Λ. ⊓  ⊔)
     2. The functor E(F )⊗I is not exact. (Applying it to Λ ֒→ W1 , we get
                               V2
W1 ⊗ Λ −→ I(W1⊗2 ) = I( W1 ), with the kernel containing S 2 Λ, since
                                                                    V
S 2 Λ is in the kernel of the composition W1 ⊗ Λ ֒→ W1⊗2 −→ 2 W1 . )
     In particular, if we denote by TorI• (W, −) the left derivatives of the
functor W ⊗I then TorI• (W1 , W2 ) 6∼   = TorI• (W2 , W1 ). (As the functor W ⊗I
is right exact, any projective object of IG is acyclic, cf., e.g., [GM], Ch.III,
§6.12., so if TorI• (W1 , W2 ) ∼
                               = TorI• (W2 , W1 ) then

                     TorIj (E(F )Q , W ) ∼
                                         = TorIj (W, E(F )Q ) = 0

if j > 0, i.e., the functor E(F )⊗I should be exact. ⊓

7 Representations induced from the compact open subgroups

In this section we give an example (Corollary 7.3) of a pair of essentially
different open compact subgroups U and U ′ in G with embeddings of E-
representations E[G/U ] ֒→ E[G/U ′ ] and E[G/U ′ ] ֒→ E[G/U ] of G. This
implies that E[G/U ] and E[G/U ′ ] have the same irreducible subquotients.
Proposition 7.4 contains one more example of this phenomenon. However,
it seems crucial for these examples that the primitive motives of maximal
                              ′
level of models of F U and F U coincide (and trivial).
    But first, two general remarks.
    Remarks. 1. Representation of G/G◦ . Let U be a compact open
subgroup in G. Then there is a surjection of the E-representation E[G/U ]
of G onto any irreducible E-representation of G factorizing through the
quotient G/G◦ .
    2. Twists by 1-dimensional representations. Let ϕ be a homomor-
phism from G/G◦ to Q× . We consider E[G/U ](ϕ) as the same E-vector
                                              τ
space as E[G/U ], but with the G-action [σ] 7−→ ϕ(τ ) · [τ σ]. Then λϕ ([σ]) :=
                                                                   λϕ
ϕ(σ)·[σ] defines an isomorphism of representations E[G/U ] −→ E[G/U ](ϕ)
of G.
    This implies that for any irreducible E-representation W of G the mul-
tiplicities of W and W (ϕ) in E[G/U ] coincide.


7.1 Purely transcendental extensions of quadratic extensions

Lemma
   T        7.1. Let U and U ′ be openT compact
                                          S      Tsubgroups in T G such that
U U ′ is of index 2 in U : U = (U U ′ ) σ(U U ′ ), and U ′ σU ′ σ ⊆ U .
Then U is the only right U -coset in U U ′ . Equivalently, for any σ1 , σ2 ∈ G
if σ1 U U ′ = σ2 U U ′ then σ1 U = σ2 U .

Proof. Equivalence. If U is the only right U -coset in U U ′ and σ1 U U ′ =
σ2 U U ′ then σ2−1 σ1 U ⊆ U U ′ , so σ2−1 σ1 U = U , i.e., σ2−1 σ1 ∈ U . Conversely,
suppose that σ1 U U ′ = σ2 U U ′ implies σ1 U = σ2 U . Then if σ1 U ⊆ U U ′ one
also has σ1 U U ′ ⊆ U U ′ and, by the measure argument, σ1 U U ′ = U U ′ , and
thus, σ1 U = U .                                              S
    Now suppose that σ1 U U ′ = σ2 U U ′ . As U U ′ = U ′ σU ′ , one has either
σ1 U ′ = σ2 U ′ and σ1 σU ′ = σ2 σU ′ , or σ1 U ′ = σ2 σU ′ and σ1 σU ′ = σ2 U ′ .
The second case can be reduced to the first one by replacing      T     σ2 with σ2 σ
(as this does not change σ2 U ). Now one has σ1−1 σ2 ∈ U ′ σU ′ σ ⊆ U , and
thus, σ1 U = σ2 U . ⊓  ⊔                T             T              T
    Remark. One obviously has U U ′ = σ(UT U ′ )σ ⊆ U ′ T (σU ′ σ). Un-
der assumptions of Lemma 7.1, this means U ′ (σU ′ σ) = U U ′ .

Lemma
  T ′ 7.2. Let U and U be some     TopenScompact     T subgroups in G such that
U U is of index 2 in U : U = (U U ′ ) σ(U U ′ ). Suppose that for any
integer N ≥ 1 and any collection τ1 , . . . , τN ∈ U ′ σ−U one has τ1 · · · τN 6= 1.

Then the morphism of E-representations E[G/U ] −−−−−−−→ E[G/U ′ ] of G
is injective.

Proof. First,
            T   we check that U ′ (σU ′ σ) ⊆ U . If τ ∈ U ′ (σU ′ σ) − U then
τ −1 ∈ U ′ (σU ′ σ) − U , so 1 = τ τ −1 ∈ (U ′ − U )((σU ′ σ) − U ) = (U ′ σ −
U )(U ′ σ − U ), which contradicts our assumption when N = 2.
                       P                                         PM
     Suppose that M       j=1 bj [σj ] is in the kernel, i.e.,     j=1 bj ([σj ] + [σj σ]) = 0,
where bj 6= 0, σj are pairwise distinct as elements of G/U and M ≥ 2. Then,
by Lemma 7.1, σi U U ′ 6= σj U U ′ for i 6= j.
     OneS considers the graph whose vertices are the right U ′ -cosets in the
           M
union j=1 σj U U ′ , and whose edges are the sets σj U U ′ for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M
which join the vertices σj U ′ and σj σU ′ . There are at least 2 edges entering
to Pa given vertex, since otherwise this “vertex” is contained in the support
        M
of j=1 bj ([σj ] + [σj σ]), so there exists a simple cycle in the graph, say,
formed by edges σ1 U U ′ , . . . , σs U U ′ for some s ≥ 3, i.e., the intersection of
the subsets σi U U ′ and σj U U ′ in G is non-empty if and only if |i − j| ∈
{0, 1, s − 1}.                                                                T
     We may suppose     T    that for any 1 ≤ j < s one has σj U U ′ σj+1 U U ′ =
σj U ′ , and σ1 U U ′ σs U U ′ = σs U ′ , and therefore, σj U ′ = σj+1 σU ′ for any

Corollary 7.3. Let 2 ≤ n < ∞ and L′′ ⊂ F bep        a subfield finitely generated
over k with tr.deg(F/L′′ ) = 1. For some u ∈ (L′′ )× − (L′′ )× and some
t ∈ F transcendental over L′′ set L = L′′ (u, T ), where T = (2t − u)2 ,
and L′ = L′′ (t). Then for U = UL and U ′ = UL′ there exist embeddings
E[G/U ′ ] ֒→ E[G/U ] and E[G/U ] ֒→ E[G/U ′ ].
                      T                          T    S T
Proof. One has U U ′ = UL′′ (t,u) , U =T(U SU ′ ) T(U U ′ )σ, where σt =
u − t and σ|L′′ (u) = id, and U ′ = (U U ′ ) (U T U ′ )τ , where τ u = −u
and τ |L′′ (t) = id. This implies that U ′ σ − U = (U U ′ )τ σ and (τ σ)2 u = u,
(τ σ)2 t = t + 2u, so for any N ≥ 1 and anyT τ1 , . . . , τN ∈ U ′ σ − U one
has τ1 · · · τN 6= 1. Similarly, U τ − U ′ = (U U ′ )στ = (U ′ σ − U )−1 , so
for any N ≥ 1 and any τ1 , . . . , τN ∈ U τ − U ′ one has τ1 · · · τN 6= 1. It
follows from Lemma 7.2 that there exist embeddings E[G/U ′ ] ֒→ E[G/U ]
and E[G/U ] ֒→ E[G/U ′ ]. ⊓    ⊔

Proof. As E[G/U ′ ] embeds naturally into E[G/U ], any subquotient of the
module E[G/U ′ ] is a subquotient of E[G/U ]. Let W be the quotient of
E[G/UL′′ ] by the sum of the images of E[G/U ′ ] under all possible E[G]-
homomorphisms to E[G/UL′′ ]. As in the proof of CH0 (Y[L] ) = Z,15 one
                   2     m
checks that W he1 e2 ···em i = 0, and thus, E[G/U ] coincides with the sum of
the images of E[G/U ′ ] under all E[G]-homomorphisms to E[G/U ]. ⊓      ⊔

    Remark. Let L be an extension of k of finite type and of transcendence
degree q in F . Then, at least assuming some conjectures, any motivic G-
module of level < q is a subquotient of Q[G/UL ] with infinite multiplicity.
To see this, fix a transcendence basis x1 , . . . , xq of L over k. Then there is

a surjection Q[G/UL ] −→ ΩF/k    , given by [1] 7−→ xs+1 dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxs for

infinite multiplicity.


A The centers of the Hecke algebras

Lemma A.1. Let K be a compact open subgroup in G. Let ν ∈ HE (K)
be an element which is not a E-multiple of hK . Then there exist elements
x1 , . . . , xn ∈ F K algebraically independent over k such that νhU 6∈ E · hU ,
where U = Uk(x1 ,...,xn ) ⊇ K.
                       P
Proof. Let ν =            aj σj hK , where the classes of σj in G/K are pairwise
distinct. After subtracting a multiple of hK , if necessary, we may suppose
that σj 6∈ K for any j. Then the sets {x ∈ F K | σi x = σj x} for i 6= j
and {x ∈ F K | σj x = x} for any j are proper k-subspaces in F K , and
therefore, there exist elements x1 , . . . , xn ∈ F K algebraically independent
over k with x1 outside their union. These conditions on x1 , . . . , xn imply
that σi |k(x1 ,...,xn ) 6= σj |k(x1 ,...,xn ) and σj |k(x1 ,...,xn ) 6= id for any i 6= j.
     Set S U = Uk(x1 ,...,xn ) . Then the support of the element ν ∗ hU coincides
with j σj U , which is not a subset in U , so ν ∗ hU is not a multiple of hU .
⊔
⊓

Lemma A.2. Let U = Uk(x1 ,...,xn ) for some x1 , . . . , xn algebraically inde-
pendent over k, and let ν be a central element either in the Hecke algebra
                                  ◦
HE (U ), or in the Hecke algebra HE (U ). Then ν ∈ E · hU .

Proof. For any τ in the normalizer of U one has ν(hU τ hU ) = νhU τ = ντ 6= 0
if ν 6= 0, and (hU τ hU )ν = τ hU ν = τ ν. We
                                           ` may suppose that the support
of ν does not contain 1, i.e., Supp(ν) = σ∈S U σU for a finite subset S in
G − U.

     Let A be the image of Q[e1 , e2 , . . . , em ] in EndG W . It is a semisimple algebra,
so we want to show that e1 e22 · · · em           m 6≡ 1 modulo any maximal ideal in A. For
                              ′′ hei1 ···eil i
this
Pd−1  we   note     that    (L  )              is rational for any 1 ≤ i1 < · · · < il ≤ m, so
                          j
  j=0  (e i1 · · · e il )   =  0. The     assumptions     on m and d imply that modulo any
maximal ideal in A the element e1 e22 · · · em          m is a non-trivial root of unity.
58                                                                         M.Rovinsky


    Let H = {τ ∈ G | τ |k(xj ) ∈ Aut(k(xj )/k) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n}, and for
each 1 ≤ j ≤ n let the subfield Lj be generated over k by x1 , . . . , xbj , . . . , xn .
As ν is a central element in H(U ), one has τ ντ −1 = ν for all τ ∈ H. In
particular, Supp(τ ντ −1 ) = Supp(ν), so each τ ∈ H induces a permutation
of the set S of double U -classes. The subgroup U ⊂ H acts trivially on S,
so the action of H on S factors through the quotient H/U ∼             = (PGL2 k) .
                                                                                      n
                                         n
Any homomorphism from (PGL2 k) to the permutation group of the set S,
is trivial, since any element of PGL2 k is (#S)!-th power of another element
of PGL2 k, and therefore, U τ στ −1 U = U σU for any σ ∈ S. In particular,
τ στ −1 xj is in the finite set U σxj for all τ ∈ H; or, even more particularly,
the set of fields k(τ σxj ) for all τ ∈ H is finite.
    Fix some j. Suppose that σxj 6∈ k(xj ) (this implies that n > 1). Then
there is 1 ≤ s ≤ n different from j such that F is algebraic over Ls (σxj ).
Set Hj = {τ ∈ ULs | τ |k(xs ) ∈ Aut(k(xs )/k)}. Then for any τ ∈ Hj one
has τ στ −1 xj = τ σxj , so the Hj -orbit of σxj should be finite, and thus, a
subgroup of finite index in Hj should be compact, so the group Hj should
be compact itself, which is false.
    As U τ στ −1 U = U σU is equivalent to U τ σ −1 τ −1 U = U σ −1 U , we get
σ ±1 xj ∈ k(xj ). If σ ±1 xj 6∈ k(xj ) then k(σ ±1 xj , xj )/k(xj ) has a non-empty
branch locus. The PGL2 k-orbit of any point on P1k is infinite, so the PGL2 k-
orbit of the branch locus is also infinite, which means that the set of fields
k(τ σ ±1 xj ) is infinite, unless k(σ ±1 xj ) is a subfield in k(xj ). Then k(xj ) =
σk(σ −1 xj ) ⊆ σk(xj ) = k(σxj ) ⊆ k(xj ). As the center of PGL2 k is trivial,
this shows that σ|k(xj ) = id. When varying j, we get σ ∈ U , contradicting
our assumptions. ⊓      ⊔

Lemma A.3. Let K be a compact subgroup in G. If n < ∞ and ν ∈
HE (K) − E · hK then there exists a compact open subgroup U containing K
such that ν ∗ hU 6∈ E · hU .

Proof. There is some σ in the support of ν outside of K, i.e., if U ′ is an open
compact subgroup in G not containing σ then there is an open subgroup
U ⊆ U ′ such that ν(σU ) 6= 0, and therefore, the support of νhU contains σ,
so it is non-empty and it does not coincide with U . ⊓ ⊔

     As a corollary of these statements we get

Theorem A.4. Let K be a compact subgroup in G. Then the centers of the
                           ◦
Hecke algebras HE (K) and HE (K) coincide with E · hK if n < ∞.

Proof. Clearly, for any pair of compact subgroups K ⊆ U the multiplication
                                                                       hU ∗
by hU : ν 7−→ νhU gives homomorphisms of the centers Z(HE (K)) −→
                        ◦       Uh ∗  ◦
Z(HE (U )) and Z(HE       (K)) −→ Z(HE  (U )). Then by Lemma A.3, we may
suppose that K is open. By Lemma A.1, we may further suppose that
                                                                     ◦
K = Uk(x1 ,...,xn ) . Then, by Lemma A.2, the centers of HE (K) and HE (K)
coincide with E · hK . ⊓   ⊔

B The case of positive characteristic

In this appendix we show that all results of §2 and §6 remain valid in the
case of char(k) = p > 0.
    The topology on G is the same as described in Introduction. The group
G is also Hausdorff, locally compact if n < ∞, and totally disconnected;
the subgroups G{F,(Fα )α∈I }/k are closed in G, the fibers of the morphism of
unitary semigroups

            {subfields in F over k} −→ {closed subgroups in G}

given by K 7−→ Aut(F/K) consist of subfields of F with the same sets
of perfect subfields containing them (with the same “perfectization”), its
image is stable under passages to sub-/sup-groups with compact quotients,
and it induces bijections

     subfields of finite type over k with F = K       subgroups of G
   The inverse correspondences are given by G ⊃ H 7−→ F H .
    Proof of Lemma 2.1. We may suppose that L and all Lα are perfect.
Then, after replacing the reference to the Galois correspondence of §2 with
the reference to the Galois correspondence of this appendix, the proof in §2
goes through. ⊓  ⊔
    Proof of Lemma 2.2. First, replace L with its “perfectization”. Let ℓ ∈
{2, 3} − {p}. Then any element τ in the common normalizer in G of all
closed subgroups of index ≤ ℓ in UL satisfies τ (L(f 1/ℓ )) = L(f 1/ℓ ) for all
f ∈ L× . If τ 6∈ UL then there is an element x ∈ L× such that τ x/x 6= 1.
Then τ x/x = y ℓ for some y ∈ F × − µℓ . Set f = x + λ for a variable
λ ∈ k. By Kummer theory,
                             τ f /f ∈ L×ℓ , and therefore, L contains L0 :=
          −ℓ 1/ℓ
k y (x+λy   )
      (x+λ)1/ℓ
               | λ ∈ k ⊂ k(x, y).
   Now we come back to our original L and replace L0 with the subfield gen-
                                                  −ℓ 1/ℓ
erated by appropriate p-primary powers of y (x+λy   )
                                              (x+λ)1/ℓ
                                                         , where p = char(k).
As tr.deg(k(x, y)/k) ≤ 2, by our assumption on L, the subfield L0 of L
should be finitely generated over k. But this is possible only if y ℓ = 1, i.e.,
if τ ∈ UL . (To see this, one can choose a smooth model of the extension
L0 (x)/k(x, y) over k and look at itsTbranch locus.) ⊓   ⊔
    Proof of Lemma 2.4. Let σ ∈ H U −{1} and k ′ be the algebraic closure
in F of any subfield in F hσi with tr.deg(F/k ′ ) = 1. As the extension F/F hσi
is abelian there is an element x ∈ F − k ′ and an integer N ≥ 2 such that
σx 6= x and either σxN = xN , or σ(xp −x) = xp −x. Then one has σ(k ′ ) = k ′
and σ(k ′ (x)) = k ′ (x).
    The rest of the proof is the same as the last two paragraphs of the proof
in §2. ⊓ ⊔
60                                                                   M.Rovinsky


    Proof of Lemma 2.5 in §2 remains valid, after we replace L′ with its
perfect closure in LL′ , but we do not claim that the inclusion PGL2 k ֒→
NG◦ UL′ /UL′ is an isomorphism. ⊓       ⊔
    Proof of Lemma 2.7. We proceed by induction on m, the case m = 0 be-
ing trivial. We wish to find wm ∈ F such that w and ξwm are algebraically
independent over k ′ generated over k by w1 , . . . , wm−1 , ξw1 , . . . , ξwm−1 .
Suppose that there is no such wm . Then for any u ∈ F − k ′ and any
v ∈ F −k ′ (ξu) one has the following vanishings in Ωk2′ (u,v,ξu,ξv)/k′ : du∧dξu =
dv ∧ dξv = 0, d(u + v) ∧ dξ(u + v) = 0, and d(u + v ℓ ) ∧ dξ(u + v ℓ ) = 0 for
any integer ℓ ≥ 2 prime to p := char(k). Applying the first two to the third,
we get ℓ(v ℓ−1 − ξv ℓ−1 )dv ∧ dξu = 0, which means that either ξv ℓ−1 = v ℓ−1
for any v ∈ F − k ′ (ξu), or dv = 0 ∈ Ωk1′ (v,ξv)/k′ for all v ∈ F − k ′ , or
dξu = 0 ∈ Ωk1′ (u,ξu)/k′ for all u ∈ F − k ′ . In the first case ξv = v for any
v ∈ F , i.e., ξ = 1.
    If ξ(k ′ ) 6= k ′ then there exists u ∈ k ′ such that ξu ∈ F − k ′ . Fix some
v ∈ F − (k ′ (ξu) ∪ ξ −1 (k ′ )). Even if ξv ∈ k ′ (v), the element ξ(uv) does not
belong to k ′ (v) = k ′ (uv), i.e., ξ(uv) and uv are algebraically independent
over k ′ .
    We may, thus, suppose that ξ(k ′ ) = k ′ . Replacing ξ with ξ −1 , we reduce
the case dξu = 0 ∈ Ωk1′ (u,ξu)/k′ to the case du = 0 ∈ Ωk1′ (u,ξu)/k′ for all
                             s
u ∈ F − k ′ . Let P (X, Y p ) be the minimal polynomial of ξu over k ′ [u] with
maximal possible integer s ≥ 1.
    Replacing ξ by Frs ξ, where Fr is the Frobenius automorphism, we get
that du 6= 0 ∈ Ωk1′ (u,ξu)/k′ . As this implies ξ = 1, we get contradiction, since
no non-zero power of the Frobenius automorphism is identical on k. This
shows that there exists desired wm ∈ F . ⊓       ⊔
    Proof of Proposition 2.14. We may suppose that L1 and L2 are perfect.
Then the proof in §2 goes through. ⊓       ⊔
    Proofs of Lemmas 2.6, 2.8, 2.12, 2.15 and 2.16, Theorem 2.9, and Corol-
laries 2.3, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.13 given in §2 remain valid without any changes.
