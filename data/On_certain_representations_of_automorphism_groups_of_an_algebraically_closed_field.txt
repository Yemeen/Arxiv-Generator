                                            are identified with a full subcategory in the category of graded smooth rep-

                                            Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. (This will be
                                            the case through out the paper, except Appendix B, where all results of ¬ß2
                                            are extended to positive characteristic.) Let F be an algebraically closed
                                            extension of k of transcendence degree n, 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ ‚àû, and let G = GF/k be
                                            the group of automorphisms over k of the field F . Let the set of subgroups

Uk(x) := Aut(F/k(x)) for all x ‚àà F be a base of neighbourhoods of the
identity in G.
    This paper arose from an attempt to (i) compare properties of various
‚Äúgeometric‚Äù categories with properties of various categories of smooth (i.e.,
with open stabilizers) representations of G, and (ii) to find analogues for
the group G of familiar results of representation theory of p-adic groups.
    The group G is very big, in particular, it contains the groups Aut(L/k) as
its sub-quotients for all sub-extensions k ‚äÇ L ‚äÇ F . All reduced irreducible
algebraic groups of dimension ‚â§ n, the group PGLn+1 k, some adelic groups
are subgroups of groups of type Aut(L/k).
    One of the main results of the paper (Theorem 2.9) is the simplicity (in
topological sense) of the group G in the case n = ‚àû, and of the subgroup
G‚ó¶ of G generated by its compact subgroups in general. This is also true in
positive characteristic, and implies (Corollary 2.11) that in the case n = ‚àû
any non-trivial continuous representation of G is faithful; and in the case
n < ‚àû any non-faithful continuous representation of G factors through a
discrete quotient G/G‚ó¶ of G. Another consequence is that G‚ó¶ (and G if
n = ‚àû) admits no smooth representations of finite degree.
    Unfortunately, I do not know much about the group G/G‚ó¶ , and this is
one of the reasons why I prefer to work in the ‚Äústable‚Äù case n = ‚àû.
    There is an evident link between representations of G and some geo-
metric objects. Namely, for a scheme X over k there is a natural smooth
G-action on the group of cycles on XF := X √ók F . Conversely, any smooth
cyclic G-module is a quotient of the G-module of ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù 0-cycles on XF
for an appropriate irreducible variety X of dimension ‚â§ n over k. The Hecke
algebras, playing an important roÃÇle in representation theory of locally com-
pact groups, become in our case algebras of non-degenerate correspondences
on certain varieties over k, cf. ¬ß3, p.15.
    In some cases one can identify the groups of morphisms between geomet-
ric objects with the groups of morphisms between corresponding G-modules
(cf. Propositions 3.6 and 4.3, and Corollary 3.7).
    (Homological) Grothendieck motives are pairs (X, œÄ) consisting of a
smooth projective variety
                       L       X over k with irreducible components Xj and a
projector œÄ = œÄ 2 ‚àà j Adim Xj (Xj √ók Xj ) in the algebra of correspondences
on X modulo an adequate equivalence
                                 L          relation. The morphisms are defined
by Hom((X ‚Ä≤ , œÄ ‚Ä≤ ), (X, œÄ)) = i,j œÄj ¬∑ Adim Xj (Xj √ók Xi‚Ä≤ ) ¬∑ œÄi‚Ä≤ . The category of
Grothendieck motives carries an additive and a tensor structures:
                M                a
   (X ‚Ä≤ , œÄ ‚Ä≤ )   (X, œÄ) := (X ‚Ä≤   X, œÄ ‚Ä≤ ‚äï œÄ),
                                     (X ‚Ä≤ , œÄ ‚Ä≤ ) ‚äó (X, œÄ) := (X ‚Ä≤ √ók X, œÄ ‚Ä≤ √ók œÄ).

A primitive q-motive is a pair (X, œÄ) as above with dim X = q and œÄ ¬∑
Aq (X √ók Y √ó P1 ) = 0 for any smooth projective variety Y over k with
dim Y < q. For instance, the category of the primitive 1-motives modulo
numerical equivalence is equivalent to the category of abelian varieties over
k with morphisms tensored with Q. If the adequate equivalence relation is
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of Ô¨Åelds                3


numerical equivalence, it follows from a result of Jannsen [Jan] that any
Grothendieck
L               motive is semi-simple and admits ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù decomposition
               ‚äói
   i,j M ij ‚äó L   , where Mij is a primitive j-motive and L = (P1 , P1 √ó {0})
(see Remark on p.27).
    The major part of the results of Section 3 can be summarized as follows.


Theorem 1.1. 1. If n = ‚àû there is a fully faithful functor B‚Ä¢ :
                                                               
      motives over k modulo    B‚Ä¢   graded semi-simple admissible

      numerical equivalence            G-modules of finite type
   The grading corresponds to powers of the motive L in the ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù
   decomposition above.
2. For any 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ ‚àû and each q ‚â• 0 there is a functor Bq , fully faithful
   if q ‚â§ n:
                                          Ô£±                          Ô£º

         primitive q-motives over k   B q
                                      ‚àí‚Üí G-modules of finite type .
       modulo numerical equivalence       Ô£≥                          Ô£æ
                                                 and of level q

   (One says that a semi-simple admissible G-module W is of level q if
   Nq W = W and Nq‚àí1 W = 0 for the filtration N‚Ä¢ defined in the beginning
   of ¬ß6.1.)
3. If n < ‚àû then the G-module Bn (M ) carries a bilinear symmetric non-
   degenerate G-equivariant form with values in an oriented G-module Q(œá)
   of degree 1, where M = (X, ‚àÜk(X) ) is the maximal primitive n-submotive
   of the motive (X, ‚àÜX ) and dim X = n.
   This form is definite if, for (n ‚àí 1)-cycles on 2n-dimensional complex
   varieties, numerical equivalence coincides with homological (e.g., for n ‚â§
   2), and therefore, Bn factors through the subcategory of ‚Äúpolarizable‚Äù G-
   modules (i.e., carrying a positive form as above).
This is a direct consequence of Corollary 3.7 and Propositions 3.8, 3.19,
3.21. Roughly speaking, the functors Bq and B‚Ä¢ = ‚äïgradedj    B[j] are defined
as spaces of 0-cycles defined over F modulo ‚Äúnumerical equivalence over k‚Äù.
Details are in ¬ß3.2, p.26, where it is shown that they are pro-representable.
It follows from Proposition 3.17 that Bq ((X, œÄ)) depends only on the bira-
tional class of X. Moreover, the functor B1 of Theorem 1.1(2) is an equiv-
alence of categories when n = ‚àû, cf. ¬ß6.2, and by Corollary 4.4, the com-
position of the functor B1 with the forgetful functor to the category of
G‚ó¶ -modules is also fully faithful.

Conjecture 1.2. The functor B‚Ä¢ is an equivalence of categories. Equivalently,
for any q ‚â• 0 the functor Bq is an equivalence of categories if n = ‚àû.

   The section is concluded by showing (Corollary 3.24) that any polariz-
able representation (in the sense of Theorem 1.1(3)) is infinite-dimensional.
This is deduced from a vanishing result (Corollary 3.23) for representations
4                                                                 M.Rovinsky


of the Hecke algebra of the subgroup Gal(F/L(x)), induced by polarizable
representations of G (here L is a subextension of k in F of finite type and
x an element of F transcendental over L with F = L(x)) corresponding to
the triviality of the primitive n-submotives of (Y √ó P1 , œÄ), where dim Y < n.
    Corollary 3.23 suggests also that the category of the primitive n-motives
is not too far from the category of the polarizable G-modules (at least, if
n ‚â§ 2). However, as the twists of the polarizables by order-two characters
of G are again polarizable, but not ‚Äúmotivic‚Äù (cf. Corollary 4.5), one should
impose some additional conditions. One of such conditions could be the
‚Äústability‚Äù in the sense that for any algebraically closed extension F ‚Ä≤ of
F any ‚Äúmotivic‚Äù representation is isomorphic to W GF ‚Ä≤ /F for some smooth
GF ‚Ä≤ /k -module W ; another one could be the ‚Äúarithmeticity‚Äù in the sense that
any ‚Äúmotivic‚Äù representation admits an extension W by a module of lower
level (in the sense of filtration N‚Ä¢ ) with W isomorphic to the restriction to
G ‚äÜ GF/k‚Ä≤ of a smooth GF/k‚Ä≤ -module for a subfield k ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ k of finite type
over Q...
    By analogy with the Langlands correspondences, one can call the G-
modules in the image of Bn cuspidal. For the groups GL over a local non-
archimedian field there are several equivalent definitions of quasicuspidal
representations. One of them: all matrix coefficients (the functions hœÉw, wi,
                                                                           e
cf. p.34) are compactly supported modulo the center. However, it is shown in
¬ß4.3 that there are no such representations for any subgroup of G containing
G‚ó¶ . This is a consequence of the irreducibility of the smooth G-modules F/k
and F √ó /k √ó , considered as modules over the subgroup G‚ó¶ of G, and their
faithfulness as modules over the algebra of compactly supported measures
on G shown in ¬ß4.1.
    In ¬ß5.1, in the case n = ‚àû, various analogues of Hilbert Theorem 90
are verified. In particular, it is shown in Proposition 5.4, that any G-torsor
under A(F ) is trivial for any algebraic group A over k. There exist, however,
interesting examples of torsors in the case n < ‚àû.
    If n = ‚àû and A is an irreducible commutative algebraic group over k,
we show in Corollary 5.2 that Ext1SmG (A(F )/A(k), Q) = Hom(A(k), Q),
where SmG is the category of smooth G-modules. If A is an abelian variety
then A(F )/A(k) = B1 (A‚à® ) (here A‚à® := Pic‚ó¶ A is the dual abelian variety),
so this should correspond to the identity Ext1MMk (Q(0), H1 (A)) = A(k)Q
in the category of mixed motives over k. If A = Gm then the identity
Ext1MMk (Q(0), Q(1)) = k √ó ‚äó Q suggests that the non-admissible G-module
F √ó /k √ó admits a motivic interpretation analogous to Q(1).
    The purpose of ¬ß6 is to introduce an abelian category IG of ‚Äúhomotopy
invariant‚Äù representations having some properties of the Chow groups. If
n = ‚àû then it contains all admissible G-modules (Proposition 6.4), it is
a Serre subcategory in SmG (Proposition 6.15), and it is closed under the
inner Hom functor on SmG (Proposition 6.26). There are no smooth pro-
jective representations of G, if n = ‚àû (cf. Remark on p.41). However, it is
shown in Corollary 6.11 that IG has enough projective objects. Namely, the
                                                                    I
inclusion functor IG ‚àí‚Üí SmG admits the left adjoint SmG ‚àí‚Üí IG , and

to any subextension L of finite type one associates the projective object
CL := IQ[G/GF/L ] of IG . For any smooth proper model X of L/k there
is a natural surjection CL ‚àí‚Üí CH0 (X √ók F )Q . One can expect (Conjec-
ture 6.16) that this is an isomorphism if n = ‚àû. If tr.deg(L/k) = 1 this is
Corollary 6.21.
    At the end of ¬ß6.2, p.50, a functorial decreasing filtration F ‚Ä¢ on objects of
IG is introduced. It is likely that in the case of G-modules of type CH0 (XF )Q
for smooth proper X over k it is the motivic filtration. This agrees with
Corollary 6.24: Ck(X) ‚àº  = Q ‚äï AlbX(F )Q ‚äï F 2 Ck(X) .
    If n = ‚àû then Conjecture 6.16, the semi-simplicity conjecture and
Bloch‚ÄìBeilinson filtration conjecture would imply (i) Conjecture 1.2, (ii)
that any irreducible object of IG is admissible, and (iii) that the G-modules
grjN W are semi-simple for any object W of IG (the latter is Conjecture 6.9).
Indeed, for some collection of subfields L ‚äÇ F of finite type and of tran-
                                                                               Œæ
scendence degree j over k there is a surjective morphism ‚äïL Q[G/GF/L ] ‚àí‚Üí
grjN W , which factors through ‚äïL grjN CL , cf. Proposition 6.8. If for a smooth
proper model Y[L] of L/k one has CL = CH0 (Y[L] √ók F )Q then grjN CL =
CH j (L ‚äók F )Q , so Œæ factors through ‚äïL CH j (L ‚äók F )Q . One can deduce
from the semi-simplicity conjecture and the filtration conjecture (cf. [B]
¬ß1.4, or [R] Prop.1.1.1)1 that CH j (L ‚äók F )Q coincides with Bj (M ), where
M is the maximal primitive j-submotive of the motive (Y[L] , ‚àÜY[L] ). Finally,
by semi-simplicity, there are projectors œÄL and an isomorphism
                                             ‚àº
                         ‚äïL Bj ((Y[L] , œÄL )) ‚àí‚Üí grjN W.

This shows (iii), and taking irreducible W (which coincides with grjN W for
some j) we get also (i) and (ii).
    It is also conjectured2 that the level filtration N‚Ä¢ is strictly compatible
with the morphisms in IG (cf. Corollary 6.10), so that, in particular, exten-
sions of G-modules in IG of lower level by irreducible G-modules in IG of
higher level are (canonically) split. Obviously, this is motivated by Hodge
theory, and one would like to find a category bigger than IG and modify
the filtration to keep this property.
    However, if we want to consider G-modules like F √ó /k √ó , the notion of
weight should be more subtle. Usually, for a pair W1 , W2 of irreducible
objects, W1 is of higher weight if Ext1 (W1 , W2 ) 6= 0, so this would give
weight(Q) <weight(F √ó /k √ó ) <weight(A(F )/A(k)), cf. ¬ß5.1, for any abelian
variety A over k, which is not good if A(F )/A(k) corresponds to H1 (A).
    If n = ‚àû, the category IG carries a tensor structure compatible with
the inner Hom, but its associativity depends on Conjecture 6.16.
    If n < ‚àû then the category of smooth G-modules has sufficiently many
projective objects. Namely, any smooth G-module is a quotient of a direct

   where it is shown that under above assumptions the localization surjection
CH ‚àó (Y[L] √ók Y[L‚Ä≤ ] ) ‚àí‚Üí CH ‚àó (L ‚äók L‚Ä≤ )Q kills the numerically trivial cycles.

sum of Q[G/Uj ] for some open compact subgroups Uj of G. However, the G-
modules Q[G/U ] seem to be very complicated. The last section contains two
examples of pairs of essentially different open compact subgroups U1 and
U2 of G with the same irreducible subquotients of Q[G/U1 ] and Q[G/U2 ].
As in both examples the primitive motives of maximal level of models of
F U1 and F U2 are trivial, one could expect that collections of irreducible
subquotients of Q[G/U ] are of motivic nature.
    In Appendix A one shows that the centers of the Hecke algebras of the
pairs (G, U ) and (G‚ó¶ , U ) (see ¬ß1.1 for the definition) consist of scalars for
any compact subgroup U in G. Compared to the analogous question for
p-adic groups, this is a negative result.


1.1 Notations, conventions and terminology

For a field F and a collection of its subrings F0 , (FŒ± )Œ±‚ààI we denote by
G{F,(FŒ± )Œ±‚ààI }/F0 the group of automorphisms of the field F over F0 pre-
serving all FŒ± , and set GF/F0 := G{F }/F0 . If K is a subfield of F then K
denotes its algebraic closure in F , tr.deg(F/K) the transcendence degree of
the extension F/K (possibly infinite, but countable), and UK denotes the
group GF/K . Throughout the paper k is an algebraically closed field, F its
algebraically closed extension with tr.deg(F/k) = n ‚â• 1 and G = GF/k .
Everywhere, except the appendix, k is of characteristic zero.
     For a totally disconnected topological group H we denote by H ‚ó¶ its
subgroup generated by the compact subgroups. Obviously, H ‚ó¶ is a normal
subgroup in H, which is open at least if H is locally compact.
     In what follows, Q is the field of rational numbers, and a module is
always a Q-vector space. For an abelian group A set AQ = A ‚äó Q.
     A representation of H in a vector space W over a field is called smooth, if
stabilizers of all vectors in W are open. A smooth representation W is called
admissible if fixed vectors of each open subgroup form a finite-dimensional
subspace in W . A representation of H in W is called continuous, if stabilizers
of all vectors in W are closed. Any cyclic G-module is a quotient of the

2 Preliminaries on closed subgroups in G

The topology on G described in Introduction has been studied in [Jac],
p.151, Exercise 5, [Œ†III-III], [Sh] Ch.6, ¬ß6.3, and [I] Ch.2, Part 1, Section
1. It is shown that G is Hausdorff, locally compact if n < ‚àû, and totally
disconnected; the subgroups G{F,(FŒ± )Œ±‚ààI }/k are closed in G, there is an in-
jective morphism of unitary semigroups

Lemma 2.1. If L ‚äÜ F containing k is the intersection of a collection {LŒ± }Œ±
of its algebraic extensions then the subgroup in G generated by all ULŒ± is
dense in UL .

Proof. Clearly, UL contains the subgroup in G generated by all ULŒ± , and
GF/L is a normal subgroup in each of ULŒ± and in UL . Set U LŒ± = ULŒ± /GF/L ,
and similarly U L = UL /GF/L . These are compact subgroups in GL/k . Then,
under the above Galois correspondence, the closure of the subgroup in GL/k
                                                      hU L | Œ±i     T
generated by all U LŒ± corresponds to the subfield L Œ±            = Œ± LŒ± = L,
i.e., to the same subfield as U L , which means that hU LŒ± | Œ±i is dense in U L ,
and therefore, hULŒ± | Œ±i is dense in UL . ‚äì  ‚äî

Lemma 2.2. Let L ‚äÇ F be such an extension of k that any subextension
of transcendence degree ‚â§ 2 is of finite type over k. Then the common
normalizer in G of all normal closed subgroups of index ‚â§ 3 in UL coincides
with UL .

Proof. Any element œÑ in the common normalizer in G of all closed subgroups
of index ‚â§ 2 in UL satisfies œÑ (L(f 1/2 )) = L(f 1/2 ) for all f ‚àà L√ó . If œÑ 6‚àà UL
then there is an element x ‚àà L√ó such that œÑ x/x 6= 1. Then œÑ x/x = y 2 for
some y ‚àà F √ó ‚àí{¬±1}. Set f = x+Œª for a variable Œª‚àà k. By Kummer theory,        
                                                               ‚àí2 1/2
œÑ f /f ‚àà L√ó2 , and therefore, L contains L0 := k y (x+Œªy   )
                                                     (x+Œª)1/2
                                                                        |Œª‚ààk    ‚äÇ
k(x, y).
    As tr.deg(k(x, y)/k) ‚â§ 2, by our assumption on L, the subfield L0 of L
should be finitely generated over k. But this is possible only if y 2 = 1, i.e.,
if œÑ ‚àà UL . (To see this, one can choose a smooth model of the extension
L0 (x)/k(x, y) over k and look at its branch locus.) ‚äì‚äî

Corollary 2.3. For any Œæ ‚àà G ‚àí {1} and any open subgroup U ‚äÜ G there
exists an element œÉ ‚àà U such that [œÉ, Œæ] ‚àà U ‚àí {1}.

Proof. Let L be such a subfield of F finitely generated over k that UL ‚äÜ U .
    Set L‚Ä≤ = LŒæ(L). Then Œæ ‚àí1 (œÉŒæœÉ ‚àí1 )|L = id for any œÉ ‚àà UL‚Ä≤ . By Lemma
2.2, the centralizer in G of UL‚Ä≤ is trivial.
                                     S       (Let {LŒ± } be the set of all finitely
generated extensions of L‚Ä≤ . Then Œ± LŒ± = F . Any element œÑ ‚àà G central-
izing TUL‚Ä≤ normalizes all subgroups in all ULŒ± , and thus, by Lemma 2.2,
œÑ ‚àà Œ± ULŒ± = {1}.) In particular, as Œæ does not centralize UL‚Ä≤ , there is
œÉ ‚àà UL‚Ä≤ with Œæ ‚àí1 œÉŒæœÉ ‚àí1 ‚àà UL ‚àí {1}. ‚äì    ‚äî

Lemma
   T      2.4. Let H 6= {1} be a normal closed subgroup in G‚ó¶ such that
H U 6= {1} for a compact subgroup U . Then H contains Uk‚Ä≤ (x) for any
                                                                    T

Proof. Let œÉ ‚àà H U ‚àí {1} and k ‚Ä≤ be the algebraic closure in F of any
               hœÉi
subfield in F      with tr.deg(F/k ‚Ä≤ ) = 1. As the extension F/F hœÉi is abelian
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of Ô¨Åelds                        9


there is an element x ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ and an integer N ‚â• 2 such that œÉx 6= x and
œÉxN = xN . Then one has œÉ(k ‚Ä≤ (x)) = k ‚Ä≤ (x).
      Let L be a finite Galois extension of k ‚Ä≤ (x). Its smooth proper model over
  ‚Ä≤
k is unramified outside a finite set S of points on a smooth proper model of
k ‚Ä≤ (x) over k ‚Ä≤ . Then there is an element Œ±L ‚àà Aut(k ‚Ä≤ (x)/k ‚Ä≤ ) such that the set

  L œÉŒ±L (S) does not intersect S, and therefore, for an extension Œ±L ‚àà GF/k‚Ä≤
                                                                                 ‚ó¶
                                                                      T     ‚àí1

                                                        ‚àí1
unramified over the model of k ‚Ä≤ (x), so L Œ±L              œÉŒ±L (L) = k ‚Ä≤ (x).
                   ‚ó¶                    ‚Ä≤
      Let Œ≤ ‚àà GF/k‚Ä≤ be given on k (x) by Œ±L , and somehow extended to the
field Œ±‚àí1L œÉŒ±L (L). Then Œ≤
                              ‚àí1

                                                 L ‚ó¶ œÉ ‚ó¶ Œ±L is the identity on k (x),
                                                                          ‚àí1
and therefore, induces an  T automorphism of           L. Since L and Œ±L œÉŒ±L (L) are
Galois extensions of L Œ±‚àí1      L  œÉŒ±   L (L) =  k ‚Ä≤
                                                     (x), for any given automorphism
œÑ of L over k ‚Ä≤ (x) there is an extension of Œ≤ to F such that for its restriction
to L the composition Œ≤ ‚àí1 ‚ó¶ œÉ ‚àí1 ‚ó¶ Œ≤ T        ‚ó¶ Œ±‚àí1
                                                 L ‚ó¶ œÉ ‚ó¶ Œ±L coincides with œÑ . This
means that the natural projection H Uk‚Ä≤ (x) ‚àí‚ÜíTGal(L/k ‚Ä≤ (x)) is surjective
                                      ‚Ä≤
for any T Galois extension L of k (x), i.e., that H Uk‚Ä≤ (x) is dense in Uk‚Ä≤ (x) .
As H Uk‚Ä≤ (x) is closed, we have H ‚äá Uk‚Ä≤ (x) . ‚äì            ‚äî

Lemma 2.5. If n = 1 then there are no proper normal open subgroups in
G‚ó¶ .

Proof. Let H be a normal open subgroup in G‚ó¶ . Then for some subfield L ‚äÇ
F finitely generated over k one has UL ‚äÜ H. For any purely transcendental
extension L‚Ä≤ ‚äÇ F of k with L‚Ä≤ = F one also has ULL‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ H, as well as
H ‚äá hœÉULL‚Ä≤ œÉ ‚àí1 | œÉ ‚àà NG‚ó¶ UL‚Ä≤ i.
    A smooth proper model over k of the extension LL‚Ä≤ /L‚Ä≤ is ramified only
over a divisor on the model P1k of L‚Ä≤ over k, but the group              ‚Ä≤ ‚àº
                                                          T NG UL /UL =
                                                                 ‚ó¶  ‚Ä≤

PGL2 k does not preserve this divisor, so the intersection œÉ‚ààNG‚ó¶ UL‚Ä≤ œÉ(LL‚Ä≤ )
                                       T
is unramified over L‚Ä≤ , i.e., the field œÉ‚ààNG‚ó¶ UL‚Ä≤ œÉ(LL‚Ä≤ ) coincides with L‚Ä≤ .
By Lemma 2.1, this shows that H ‚äá UL‚Ä≤ for any purely transcendental
extension L‚Ä≤ ‚äÇ F of k with L‚Ä≤ = F , and therefore, H contains all compact
subgroups in G, so finally, H ‚äá G‚ó¶ . ‚äì  ‚äî

Lemma 2.6. Let H be a closed subgroup of G‚ó¶ . Assume that for any al-
gebraically closed extension k ‚Ä≤ of k in F with tr.deg(F/k ‚Ä≤ ) = 1 and any
x ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ the subgroup H contains Uk‚Ä≤ (x) . Then H = G‚ó¶ .

Proof. Any element œÉ of a compact subgroup in G‚ó¶ can be presented as the
limit of a compatible collection (œÉL ) of embeddings œÉL of finitely generated
extensions L of k in F into F . Replacing L with the compositum of the
images of L under powers of œÉ, we may suppose that L is œÉ-invariant.
    For a finitely generated k-algebra R with the fraction field LhœÉi , let X
be the affine variety over k with the coordinate ring R[t, œÉt, œÉ 2 t, . . . ] ‚äÇ L
for some t ‚àà L such that L = LhœÉi (t). Let Y := Spec(R) ‚äÜ AN    k .
    By induction on dim X we show that there is a fibration of a Zariski
open hœÉi-invariant subset of X by hœÉi-invariant irreducible curves. Namely,
if dim X = 1 there is nothing to prove. If dim X > 1 then, by TheÃÅoreÃÄme 6.3
10                                                                        M.Rovinsky


4) of [Jou],3 pull-backs of sufficiently general hyperplanes in AN   k under the
composition X ‚àí‚Üí Y ÷í‚Üí Ak are irreducible, and thus, there is a fibration
of a Zariski open hœÉi-invariant subset U of X by hœÉi-invariant irreducible
divisors with the base S. By induction assumption, there is a fibration of a
Zariski open hœÉi-invariant subset of U √óS k(S) by hœÉi-invariant irreducible
curves over k(S), i.e., there is a fibration of a Zariski open hœÉi-invariant
subset U ‚Ä≤ of X by hœÉi-invariant irreducible curves over k.
    Then the function field k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ of the base is a subfield in LhœÉi algebraically
closed in L and containing k. Let x ‚àà LhœÉi ‚àí k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ , and let k ‚Ä≤ be a maximal al-
gebraically closed subfield in F containing k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ but not x. Then œÉ|L coincides
with restriction to L of an element of Uk‚Ä≤ (x) . This shows that œÉ belongs to
the closure of the union of Uk‚Ä≤ (x) over all k ‚Ä≤ and all x ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ . ‚äì
                                                                       ‚äî
Lemma 2.7. If Œæ is a non-trivial element of G and 2m ‚â§ n then there
exist elements w1 , . . . , wm ‚àà F such that w1 , . . . , wm , Œæw1 , . . . , Œæwm are al-
gebraically independent over k.
Proof. We proceed by induction on m, the case m = 0 being trivial. We wish
to find wm ‚àà F such that w and Œæwm are algebraically independent over k ‚Ä≤
generated over k by w1 , . . . , wm‚àí1 , Œæw1 , . . . , Œæwm‚àí1 . Suppose that there is
no such wm . Then for any u ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ and any v ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ (Œæu) one has the
                          2
following vanishings in ‚Ñ¶F/k   ‚Ä≤ : du‚àßdŒæu = dv ‚àßdŒæv = 0, d(u+v)‚àßdŒæ(u+v) =

0, and d(u + v ) ‚àß dŒæ(u + v 2 ) = 0. Applying the first two to the third, we
                2

get 2(v ‚àí Œæv)dv ‚àß dŒæu = 0, which means that Œæv = v for any v ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ (Œæu),
i.e., Œæ = 1. This contradiction shows that there exists desired wm ‚àà F . ‚äì      ‚äî
Lemma 2.8. Let L be a subfield of F with tr.deg(F/L) = ‚àû. Then G‚ó¶F/L
is dense in GF/L .
Proof. Fix a transcendence basis x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . of F over L. We wish to show
that for each œÉ ‚àà GF/L , any integer m ‚â• 1 and any y1 , . . . , ym ‚àà F there
is a triplet (œÑ1 , œÑ2 , œÑ3 ) of elements of some compact subgroups in GF/L such
that œÑ3 œÑ2 œÑ1 œÉys = ys for all 1 ‚â§ s ‚â§ m. As y1 , . . . , ym are algebraic over
k0 := L(x1 , . . . , xM ) for some integer M ‚â• m, it is enough to show that for
each œÉ ‚àà GF/L and any integer M ‚â• 1 there is a pair (œÑ1 , œÑ2 ) of elements of
some compact subgroups in GF/L such that œÑ2 œÑ1 œÉxs = xs for all 1 ‚â§ s ‚â§ M .
    Let k1 := k0 œÉ(k0 ), zj ‚àà F ‚àí kj and kj+1 := kj (zj ) for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ M . Let
œÑ1 œÉxj = zj and œÑ1 zj = œÉxj for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ M and œÑ1 is somehow extended

for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ M and œÑ2 is somehow extended to an element of a compact

Proof. Let H be a non-trivial closed subgroup in G normalized by G‚ó¶ . By
Corollary 2.3, H intersects non-trivially any open           T compact   subgroup in G‚ó¶
                                                                 ‚ó¶
if n < ‚àû. Then, by Lemma 2.4, the group H GF/k‚Ä≤ is an open normal
subgroup in G‚ó¶F/k‚Ä≤ for any algebraically closed extension k ‚Ä≤ of k in F with

tr.deg(F/k ‚Ä≤ ) = 1, and thus, by Lemma 2.5, H G‚ó¶F/k‚Ä≤ = G‚ó¶F/k‚Ä≤ . Then
Lemma 2.6 implies that H ‚äá G‚ó¶ .
     In the case n = ‚àû and H is normal, we fix a pair of transcendence basis

such that w1 , . . . , wm , Œæw1 , . . . , Œæwm are algebraically independent over k.
Then there exist elements œÑ1 , œÑ2 ‚àà G such that œÑ1 xj = wj , œÑ1 zj = Œæwj and
œÑ2 yj = wj , œÑ2 zj = Œæwj for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ m. Then œÉ := œÑ2‚àí1 ‚ó¶Œæ ‚àí1 ‚ó¶œÑ2 ‚ó¶œÑ1‚àí1 ‚ó¶Œæ ‚ó¶œÑ1
sends xj to yj for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ m.
     This implies that there is a compact subgroup U intersecting H non-
trivially, so by Lemma 2.4, H contains Uk‚Ä≤ (x) for some algebraically closed
extension k ‚Ä≤ of k in F with tr.deg(F/k ‚Ä≤ ) = 1, and for some x ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ . By
Lemma 2.5, this implies that H contains G‚ó¶F/k‚Ä≤ .
     The algebraically closed extensions k ‚Ä≤ of k in F with tr.deg(F/k ‚Ä≤ ) = 1
form a single G-orbit, so one can apply Lemma 2.6, which gives H ‚äá G‚ó¶ .
Finally, it follows from Lemma 2.8 that H = G. ‚äì                ‚äî

Corollary 2.10. Any smooth representation of G‚ó¶ of finite degree is trivial.
   (Proof. This is clear, since there are no proper open normal subgroups
in G‚ó¶ .) ‚äì
         ‚äî

Corollary 2.11. For any subgroup H of G containing G‚ó¶ and any contin-
uous homomorphism œÄ from H either œÄ is injective, or the restriction of œÄ
to G‚ó¶ is trivial.

Proof. If œÄ is not injective then, by Corollary 2.3, its kernel has a non-trivial
intersection with G‚ó¶ . Then, by Theorem 2.9, the kernel of œÄ contains G‚ó¶ .

Lemma 2.12. Let d ‚â• 0 beTan integer, F1 and F2 be algebraically closed
subfields of F such that F1 F2 = k and tr.deg(F/F2 ) ‚â• d. Then for any
subfield L in F with tr.deg(L/k) = d there is Œæ ‚àà H := hGF/F1 , GF/F2 i such
that tr.deg(Œæ(L)F2 /F2 ) = d.

Proof. We proceed by induction on d, the case d = 0 being trivial. If d > 0 fix
a subfield L1 ‚äÇ L with tr.deg(L1 /k) = d ‚àí 1 and some t ‚àà L transcendental
over L1 .
    Replacing F1 with the algebraic closure in F of the subfield generated
over F1 by a transcendence basis of F over F1 F2 (thus, making H smaller),
we may assume that F is algebraic over F1 F2 . In particular, there exists a
subfield K ‚äÇ F1 over k with tr.deg(K/k) = d and tr.deg(KF2 /F2 ) = d.
12                                                                          M.Rovinsky


     By the induction assumption, there exists an element œÑ ‚àà H such that
tr.deg(œÑ (L1 )F2 /F2 ) = d ‚àí 1, i.e., we may suppose that tr.deg(L1 F2 /F2 ) =
d ‚àí 1. Moreover, we may suppose that L1 = k(t1 , . . . , td‚àí1 ) is purely tran-
scendental over k and L = L1 (t).
     The subgroup GF/F2 acts transitively on the set of purely transcenden-
tal extensions of F2 of a given transcendence degree, so for any collection
x1 , . . . , xd‚àí1 of elements of F1 algebraically independent over F2 there is
œÉ ‚àà GF/F2 such that œÉtj = xj .
     If t 6‚àà L1 F2 then induction is completed, so we assume that t is algebraic
over L1 F2 , i.e., there is an irreducible polynomial P ‚àà F2 [X1 , . . . , Xd ] ‚àí
k[X1 , . . . , Xd ] with P (t1 , . . . , td ) = 0, where td := t.
     Consider the irreducible hypersurface
           W = {(y1 , . . . , yd ) | P (y1 , . . . , yd ) = 0} ÷í‚Üí AdF2 ‚àí‚Üí Adk
                            œÄ
and the projection W ‚àí‚Üí Ad‚àí1         F2  to the first d ‚àí 1 coordinates. Suppose
that for any œÉ as above one has œÉt ‚àà F1 . Then for any generic point
(x1 , . . . , xd‚àí1 ) ‚àà Ad‚àí1
                         F     as above the points of the fiber of the projection
œÄ over (x1 , . . . , xd‚àí1 ) are defined
                                      T over F1 . This means that W is defined
over F1 , and therefore, over F1 F2 = k, contradicting tr.deg(L/k) = d.
    Therefore, there is œÉ ‚àà GF/F2 such that œÉ(L1 ) ‚äÇ F1 and œÉt 6‚àà F1 , so in
the rest of the proof we assume that L1 ‚äÇ F1 and t 6‚àà F1 .
    The GF/F1 -orbit of t coincides with F ‚àí F1 . As the intersection
                               \                     [         
                     (F ‚àí F1 )     F ‚àí L1 F2 = F ‚àí F1 L1 F2

is non-empty, there is an element Œæ in GF/F1 such that Œæt ‚àà F ‚àí L1 F2 , so
finally, tr.deg(Œæ(L)F2 /F2 ) = d. ‚äì

Corollary 2.13. In notations of Lemma 2.12, for any œÉ ‚àà G there is œÑ ‚àà H
such that œÉ|L = œÑ |L .
Proof. According to Lemma 2.12, there exist elements Œæ, Œæ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà H such that
         tr.deg(Œæ ‚Ä≤ (L)F2 /F2 ) = tr.deg(ŒæœÉ(L)F2 /F2 ) = tr.deg(L/k).
                                                                                   ‚àº
Evidently, there is Œª ‚àà GF/F2 ‚äÇ H inducing an isomorphism Œæ ‚Ä≤ (L) ‚àí‚Üí

Proposition
   T         2.14. Let L1 and

L1 L2 is algebraic over L1 L2 and tr.deg(F/L2 ) = ‚àû. Then the sub-
group in G generated by GF/L1 and GF/L2 is dense in GF/L1 T L2 .
Proof. The inclusion hGF/L1 , GF/L2 i ‚äÜ GF/L1 T L2 is evident. In Corollary
                              T
2.13 we may replace k with L1 L2 to get that the subgroup in G generated
by GF/L1 and GF/L2 is dense in GF/L1 T L2 .

Lemma 2.15. If n < ‚àû and F 6= k ‚Ä≤ , for a subfield k ‚Ä≤ over k in F , then
G = GF/k‚Ä≤ ¬∑ G‚ó¶ .

Proof. We may suppose that k ‚Ä≤ is algebraically closed and maximal in F ‚àí
{x} for some x ‚àà F ‚àí k. Fix a transcendence basis x1 , . . . , xn‚àí1 of k ‚Ä≤ over
k. We have to show that for each œÉ ‚àà G there is such an element œÑ ‚àà G‚ó¶
that œÉœÑ xs = xs for all 1 ‚â§ s < n.
      Set xn = x. Let 0 ‚â§ j < n be the maximal integer with the property that
there is an element œÑ ‚àà G‚ó¶ such that œÉœÑ ‚àà GF/k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ , where k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ = k(x1 , . . . , xj ).
For such œÑ set œÉœÑ = œÉ ‚Ä≤ . Suppose that 0 ‚â§ j < n ‚àí 1. Then, by Lemma 2.7,
there exists w ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ such that w and œÉ ‚Ä≤ w are algebraically independent
over k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ . There are integers s, s‚Ä≤ > j such that w is transcendental over
k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (xs ) and œÉ ‚Ä≤ w is transcendental over k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (xs‚Ä≤ ).
      Then there are elements œÑ1 , œÑ2 , œÑ3 , œÑ4 of some compact subgroups of
GF/k‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ such that œÑ1 xj+1 = xs , œÑ2 xs = w, œÑ3 (œÉ ‚Ä≤ w) = xs‚Ä≤ , œÑ4 xs‚Ä≤ = xj+1 .
Then the automorphism œÑ4 œÑ3 œÉ ‚Ä≤ œÑ2 œÑ1 = œÉœÑ0 , where œÑ0 ‚àà G‚ó¶ , acts trivially on
k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (xj+1 ), contradicting our assumptions. This means that j = n ‚àí 1. ‚äì      ‚äî

Lemma 2.16. Let L be a subfield of F and S be a set of elements of F alge-
braically independent over L. Then the group H generated by GF/L(S‚àí{x})
for all x ‚àà S is dense in GF/L .

                                                                    ‚Ä≤
Proof. If H contains the subgroups GF/L(S ‚Ä≤ ) for all   S subsets S ‚äÇ S with
finite complement then it contains the closure of S ‚Ä≤ GF/L(S ‚Ä≤ ) coincident
with GF/L(T S‚Ä≤ S ‚Ä≤ ) = GF/L . So it suffices to treat the case S = {x, y}.
    For any z ‚àà F ‚àí L there is an element œÉ ‚àà GF/L(x) GF/L(y) such that
œÉx = z, so H contains œÉGF/L(x) œÉ ‚àí1 = GF/L(z) , and thus, H is a normal
subgroup in UL . By Theorem 2.9, H contains GF/L if tr.deg(F/L) = ‚àû, and
H contains G‚ó¶F/L otherwise. By Lemma 2.15, in the latter case the projection
GF/L(x) ‚àí‚Üí GF/L /G‚ó¶F/L is surjective, and thus, hGF/L(x) , GF/L(y) i surjects
onto GF/L /G‚ó¶F/L , so hGF/L(x) , GF/L(y) i = GF/L .
   As the subgroup GF/L(x) of H surjects onto GF/L /GF/L ‚àº
                                                         = Aut(L/L),
and H is an extension of a subgroup in GF/L /GF/L by GF/L ‚äÜ H, we get
H = GF/L . ‚äì ‚äî


3 Some geometric representations

Now we are going to construct a supply of semi-simple admissible represen-
tations of G. Recall ([BZ]), that for each smooth E-representation W of G
and each compact subgroup U of G the Hecke algebra HE (U ) acts on the
space W U , since W U = hU (W ).
    Note that the definition in ¬ß1.1 on p.7 is equivalent to the usual definition
of G the Hecke algebra when U is open.
14                                                                 M.Rovinsky


Proposition 3.1. 1. Let 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ ‚àû. Then a smooth E-representation W
   of G is irreducible if and only if for each compact subgroup U with F U
   purely transcendental over an extension of k of finite type the HE (U )-
   module W U is irreducible.
2. Let Wj for j = 1, 2 be smooth irreducible E-representations of G and
   W1U 6= 0 for some compact subgroup U . Then W1 is equivalent to W2 if
   and only if W1U is equivalent to W2U .
3. For each open compact U ‚äÇ G and each irreducible E-representation œÑ
   of the algebra HE (U ) there is a smooth irreducible representation W of
   G with œÑ ‚àº= WU.
Proof. If n < ‚àû then this is Proposition 2.10 of [BZ]. In the case n = ‚àû
the proof is modified as follows.
1. Suppose that W is irreducible and W U 6= 0. If V is a non-zero HE (U )-
   submodule in W U then the natural morphism DE hU ‚äóHE (U) V ‚àí‚Üí W
   is non-zero, and thus, surjective. Then V = hU DE hU ‚äóHE (U) V surjects
   onto W U , i.e., V = W U .
   Conversely, let W1 ‚äÇ W be a non-zero proper subrepresentation. Fix
   an element e ‚àà W ‚àí W1 . There is a compact subgroup U ‚äÇ Stabe with
   F U purely transcendental over an extension of k of finite type. Then
   e ‚àà W1U 6= W U , giving contradiction.
2. ‚ÄúOnly if‚Äù part is evident, so suppose that the HE (U )-modules W1U and
   W2U are isomorphic. Then one has DE hU ‚äóHE (U) W1U ‚àº   = DE hU ‚äóHE (U)
   W2U . Set WU := {w ‚àà W | hU DE w = 0} and U W := W/WU .
   Then U (DE hU ‚äóHE (U) WjU ) is irreducible, since otherwise the inclusion
   0 6= W3 ‚äÇ U (DE hU ‚äóHE (U) WjU ) would imply W3U = WjU , and therefore,
   that W3 = U (DE hU ‚äóHE (U) WjU ). This gives that

      W1 =   U (DE hU   ‚äóHE (U) W1U ) ‚àº
                                      =   U (DE hU   ‚äóHE (U) W1U ) = W2 . ‚äì
                                                                          ‚äî
Lemma 3.2. Let W be a smooth E-representation of G. Suppose that for
each compact subgroup U ‚äÇ G with F U purely transcendental over an ex-
tension of k of finite type the HE (U )-submodule W U is semi-simple. Then
W is semi-simple.
Proof. Let W0 be the sum of all irreducible E-subrepresentations of G in W .
Suppose W 6= W0 and e ‚àà W ‚àíTW0 . Let V be the subrepresentation of G in
W generated by e, and V0 = V W0 . Let V2 be a maximal subrepresentation
of G in V ‚àí {e} containing V0 . Then the representation V1 = V /V2 of G is
irreducible. Our goal is to embed V1 into W . Let U be a compact subgroup in
G such that F U is purely transcendental over an extension of k of finite type
and V1U 6= 0. By Proposition 3.1(1), the HE (U )-module V1U is irreducible.
As the HE (U )-module V U is semi-simple and V U /V2U is isomorphic to V1U ,
there is an HE (U )-submodule NU in V U isomorphic to V1U and intersecting
V2 trivially.
    For each open subgroup U ‚Ä≤ of U the HE (U ‚Ä≤ )-submodule NU‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ of U ‚Ä≤ -
invariants of the subrepresentation of G in V generated by NU splits into

    As (NU‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ )U = hU ‚àó DE NU = hU ‚àó DE ‚àó hU NU = NU , there is exactly one
index j such that AU   j 6= 0. For this index one has mj = 1. By Proposition
3.1(3), there are smooth irreducible representations W1 and W2 of G such
that W1U ‚àº
          ‚Ä≤
            = Aj and W2U ‚àº
                            ‚Ä≤
                               = V1U . Since W1U ‚àº
                                      ‚Ä≤
                                                 = W2U , by Proposition 3.1(2),
one has W1 ‚àº                  ‚àº     ‚Ä≤
                                  U
               =WS2 , so Aj = V1 . Set NU ‚Ä≤ = Aj .
    Then N := U ‚Ä≤ ‚äÇU NU ‚Ä≤ is a E-subrepresentation of G in V intersecting
V0 trivially. (The action of œÉ ‚àà G on NUL for some finite extension L of
F U is given by the composition of the embedding NUL ‚äÜ NULœÉ(L) with
hLœÉ(L) ‚àó œÉ ‚àó hLœÉ(L) ‚àà End(NULœÉ(L) ). Here hL := hUL is the Haar measure
on UL , and we have used œÉ : W UL ‚àí‚Üí W UœÉ(L) ‚äÜ W ULœÉ(L) .) By Proposition
3.1(1), the E-representation N of G is irreducible. This contradicts the
definition of W0 . ‚äì  ‚äî

    For any irreducible variety Y over k with k(Y ) = F U for a compact
open subgroup U in G one can identify the Hecke algebra H(U ) with the
Q-algebra of non-degenerate correspondences on Y (i.e., of formal linear
combinations of n-subvarieties in Y √ók Y dominant over both factors Y ).
This follows from the facts that the set of double classes U \G/U can be
identified with a basis of H(U ) as a Q-space via [œÉ] 7‚àí‚Üí hU ‚àó œÉ ‚àó hU ; that
irreducible n-subvarieties in Y √ók Y dominant over both factors Y are in
a natural bijection with the set of maximal ideals in F U ‚äók F U , and the
following lemma.
Lemma 3.3. Let L, L‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ F be field subextension of k with tr.deg(L/k) =
q < ‚àû. Then the set of double classes UL‚Ä≤ \G/UL is canonically identi-
fied with the set of all points in Spec(L ‚äók L‚Ä≤ ) of codimension ‚â• q ‚àí
tr.deg(F/L‚Ä≤ ) (so UL‚Ä≤ \G/UL = Max(L ‚äók L‚Ä≤ ), if F = L‚Ä≤ ). Here G/UL =
{embeddings of L into F over k}.
Proof. To any embedding œÉ : L ÷í‚Üí F over k one associates the ideal in L‚äók F
generated by elements x ‚äó 1 ‚àí 1 ‚äó œÉx for all x ‚àà F . It is maximal, since it is
                                        œÉ¬∑id
the kernel of the surjection L ‚äók F ‚àí‚Üí F . Conversely, any maximal ideal m
                                                         œï
in L ‚äók F determines a homomorphism L ‚äók F ‚àí‚Üí (L ‚äók F )/m = Œû with Œû
a field. Since its restriction to the subfield k ‚äók F is an embedding, one can
regard F as a subfield of Œû. Let t1 , . . . , tm be a transcendence basis of L over
k. As L is algebraic over L0 := k(t1 , . . . , tm ), Œû is integral over œï(L0 ‚äók F ), so
the latter is a field. One has Spec(L0 ‚äók F ) ‚äÇ Spec(F [t1 , . . . , tm ]) = Am     F.
On any subvariety of Am     F outside the union of all divisors defined over k
there is an F -point which also lies outside the union of all divisors defined
over k, and therefore, Max(L0 ‚äók F ) ‚äÇ Max(F [t1 , . . . , tm ]). This means
that œï(L0 ‚äók F ) = F , and therefore, Œû = F . The restriction of œï to L ‚äók k
gives an embedding œÉ : L ÷í‚Üí F over k. ‚äì         ‚äî

    Let Aq (Y ) be the quotient of the Q-space Z q (Y ) of cycles on a smooth
                                                                   q
proper variety Y over k of codimension q by the Q-subspace Z‚àº        (Y ) of cy-
cles ‚àº-equivalent to zero for an adequate equivalence relation ‚àº. According
to Hironaka, each smooth variety X admits an open embedding i into a
smooth proper variety X over k. Then Aq (‚àí) can be extended to arbitrary
                                                   q                               i‚àó
smooth variety X as the cokernel of the map Z‚àº       (X) ‚àí‚Üí Z q (X) induced
by restriction of cycles. This is independent of the choice of variety X.4
    In the standard way one extends the contravariant functors Aq ( ) and
  q
Z ( ) to contravariant functors on the category of smooth pro-varieties over
k. Namely, if for a set of indices I, an inverse system (Xj )j‚ààI of smooth
varieties over k is formed with respect to flat morphisms and X is the limit,
then Z q (X) = lim Z q (Xj ), where the direct system is formed with respect

to the pull-backs, and similarly for Aq ( ). This is independent of the choice
of the projective system defining X.
    In particular, as for any commutative k-algebra R the scheme Spec(R)
is an inverse limit of a system of k-varieties, Aq (R) := Aq (Spec(R)) is
defined. Any automorphism Œ± of the k-algebra R induces a morphism of
a system (Xj )j‚ààI defining Spec(R) to a system (Œ±‚àó (Xj ))j‚ààI canonically
equivalent to (Xj )j‚ààI , and therefore, induces an automorphism of Aq (YR )
for any k-scheme Y . This gives a contravariant functor from a category of
varieties over k to the category of Aut(R/k)-modules. Set B q (X) = Aq (X)
for ‚àº=numerical equivalence.
    In what follows X will be of type YF for a k-subscheme Y in a variety
over k. It should be stressed that in this case B q (X) = B q (YF ) means
not some sort of numerical equivalence over F , but a limit of cycle groups
modulo numerical equivalence of varieties over k.

    The homomorphism of algebras H(U ) ‚àí‚Üí Adim Y (Y √ók Y ) is surjective
for any smooth projective Y , as one can see from the following ‚Äúmoving
lemma‚Äù, applied in the case X1 = X2 = Y and Z = X1 √ók X2 . (Its present
form is suggested by the referee.)

Lemma 3.4. Let Z, X1 , . . . , Xr be irreducible projective varieties over k,
           pj
and let Z ‚àí‚Üí Xj be surjective maps. Let Œ± ‚äÇ Z be an irreducible subvariety
of dimension q ‚â• max dim Xj . Then Œ± is rationally equivalent to a linear
                   1‚â§j‚â§r
combination of some irreducible subvarieties in Z surjective (under maps
pj ) over all Xj ‚Äôs.

Proof. Choose a closed irreducible subvariety W in Z containing Œ± as a
divisor such that W is surjective (under maps pj ) over all Xj . We can
replace Z by W and assume that Œ± has codimension 1 in Z. Then we can
replace Z by the blowup of Z along Œ±. Since Œ± is the direct image of its
pullback, we can assume Œ± is a Cartier divisor on Z. Since our varieties
are taken to be projective, any Cartier divisor is rationally equivalent to a
difference of two very ample divisors, which we take to dominate the Xj ‚Äôs.

    Let Z dim Y (k(Y ) ‚äók F ) ‚àí‚Üí Aq (XF ) be a G-homomorphism. Fix an
                    œÉ
embedding k(Y ) ÷í‚Üí F . For any Œæ ‚àà G one has œï(ŒæœÉ) = Œæœï(œÉ), in particular,
if Œæ|œÉ(k(Y )) = id then œï(œÉ) ‚àà Aq (XF )UœÉ(k(Y )) = Aq (XœÉ(k(Y )) ).5 From this
and the fact that the pairing Aq (X √ók Y ) ‚äó Adim Y (YF ) ‚àí‚Üí Aq (XF ) factors
through Aq (Xk(Y ) ) ‚äó Adim Y (YF ) ‚àí‚Üí Aq (XF ),6 one deduces that sending a
cycle Œ± ‚àà Aq (Xk(Y ) ) to the action of its arbitrary lifting to a correspondence
on X √ók Y determines a homomorphism

                 Aq (Xk(Y ) ) ‚àí‚Üí HomG (Adim Y (YF ), Aq (XF )),

which is surjective and canonical. On the other hand, it has the inverse
                                                     ‚àº
given by œï 7‚àí‚Üí œÉ‚àó‚àí1 œï(œÉ), where œÉ‚àó : Aq (Xk(Y ) ) ‚àí‚Üí Aq (XœÉ(k(Y )) ).
    The map Hom(A, B) ‚àí‚Üí HomG (A(F ), B(F )) is clearly injective. Let
          œï
A(F ) ‚àí‚Üí B(F )) be a G-homomorphism. Fix an irreducible curve C ‚äÇ A
over k generating A as an algebraic group, i.e., with the dominant multipli-
cation map C N ‚àí‚Üí A for any N ‚â• dim A. Fix a generic point x ‚àà C(F ).
Since œï(œÑ x) = œÑ œï(x), the element œï(x) is fixed by any element œÑ fixing
x, so any coordinate of œï(x) is a rational function over k in coordinates
of x, and therefore, this gives rise to a rational k-map h : C ‚àí ‚àí ‚Üí B.
Consider the rational k-map C N ‚àí ‚àí ‚Üí B given by (x1 , . . . , xN ) 7‚àí‚Üí

Corollary 3.7. For any field L‚Ä≤ of finite type and of transcendence degree
m ‚â§ n over k, any field L of finite type over k and any integer q ‚â• m there
is a canonical isomorphism

where the both groups are zero if q > m.

Proof. Let Y be an irreducible smooth projective variety over k with the
function field k(Y ) = L‚Ä≤ . The group Am (L‚Ä≤ ‚äók F ) is the quotient of Am (YF )
by the sum of the images of Am‚àí1 (D   e F ) for all divisors D on Y and their
desingularizations D.e
   Then the target of (3.1) is a subgroup in HomG (Am (YF ), Aq (L ‚äók F )).
   By Proposition 3.6, HomG (Am (YF ), Aq (L ‚äók F )) = Aq (L ‚äók L‚Ä≤ ), and
                         e F ), Aq (L ‚äók F )) = Aq (L ‚äók k(D)),
             HomG (Am‚àí1 (D

which is zero, since dim D < q. The vanishing of HomG (Am‚àí1 (De F ), Aq (L‚äók
F )) for all divisors D on Y implies the coincidence of both sides in (3.1).

Proposition 3.8. The G-module7 BqX = B q (X √ók F ) is admissible for any
smooth proper k-variety X and any q ‚â• 0. If n < ‚àû then BqX is semi-simple.
    If q = 0, or q = 1, or q = dim X ‚â§ n then BqX is semi-simple and of
finite length.

Proof. By a standard argument, we may suppose that k is embedded into
the field of complex numbers C, and thus, for any smooth proper k-variety
Y with k(Y ) ‚äÇ F the space B q (X √ók F )Uk(Y ) is a quotient of the finite-
dimensional space Z q (X √ók Y )/ ‚àºhom ‚äÜ H 2q ((X √ók Y )(C), Q(q)), so the
representation B q (X √ók F ) is admissible.
    For each smooth irreducible variety Y over k with k(Y ) ‚äÇ F and k(Y ) =
F the kernel of Aq (X √ók Y ) ‚àí‚Üí Aq (X √ók k(Y )) is a An (Y √ók Y )-submodule
in Aq (X √ók Y ), since for its arbitrary element Œ± and for any element Œ≤ ‚àà
An (Y √ók Y ) one has Œ± ‚ó¶ Œ≤ = pr13‚àó (pr‚àó12 Œ± ¬∑ pr‚àó23 Œ≤), so
                                                         T the projection to Y of
the support of Œ± ‚ó¶ Œ≤ is contained in pr2 ((D √ók Y ) supp(Œ≤)) for a divisor
D on Y , which is of dimension n ‚àí 1, so cannot dominate Y . This implies
that Aq (X √ók k(Y )) has a natural structure of a An (Y √ók Y )-module.
    By [Jan], the algebra B n (Y √ók Y ) is semi-simple, so the B n (Y √ók Y )-
module B q (X √ók k(Y )) is also semi-simple. By the moving lemma 3.4, the
ring homomorphism HUk(Y ) ‚àí‚Üí B n (Y √ók Y ), induced by the identification
of the Hecke algebra HUk(Y ) with the algebra of non-degenerate correspon-
dences on Y , (see p.15) is surjective. This gives a (semi-simple) HUk(Y ) -
module structure on any B n (Y √ók Y )-module. Then, by Lemma 3.2, the
G-module B q (X √ók F ) is semi-simple.

     Recall that B q (X √ók F ) is a limit of certain quotients of Q-spaces of classes
of numerical equivalence of cycles on smooth proper varieties over k, but not over
F , cf. pp.16‚Äì17 before Lemma 3.4.

     Now suppose that n = ‚àû. By the same result of Jannsen [Jan], the cate-
gory
L of motives modulo numerical equivalence is semi-simple. Let (X, ‚àÜX ) =
   j (X, œÄj ) be a decompositionL    into a (finite) direct sum of irreducible
submotives. Then B q (XF ) =                  q                     q
                                        j œÄj B (XF ). If W = œÄj B (XF ) is re-
ducible there is a non-zero proper G-submodule W0 in W . Fix elements
e0 ‚àà W0 ‚àí 0 and e1 ‚àà W ‚àí W0 . Then the common stabilizer of e0 and e1
is an open subgroup in G, so it contains a subgroup UL for a subfield L
of F finitely generated over k. Let F ‚Ä≤ be an algebraically closed extension
                                                      G    ‚Ä≤
of L with dim X ‚â§ tr.deg(F ‚Ä≤ /k) < ‚àû. Then W0 F/F is a non-zero proper

GF ‚Ä≤ /k -module in W GF/F ‚Ä≤ = œÄj (B q (XF )) F/F ‚Ä≤ , so the length of the GF ‚Ä≤ /k -

module œÄj (B (XF ))            = œÄj B (XF ‚Ä≤ ) is ‚â• 2. By Proposition 3.6, there
is a canonical surjection Endmotive/k ((X, œÄj )) ‚àí‚Üí EndGF ‚Ä≤ /k (œÄj B q (XF ‚Ä≤ )) if
q ‚àà {0, 1, dim X}. By the irreducibility of (X, œÄj ) we have a division algebra
on the left hand side, but the algebra on the right hand side has divisors of
zero since the GF ‚Ä≤ /k -module œÄj B q (XF ‚Ä≤ ) is semi-simple, but not irreducible,
giving contradiction.
     Any cyclic semi-simple G-module, Bdim    X
                                                  X

is of finite length.
     It follows from Lefschetz theorem on (1, 1)-classes that for any smooth
proper k-variety Y one has B 1 (X √ók Y ) = B 1 (X) ‚äï Hom(AlbX, AlbY ) ‚äï
B 1 (Y ). By Lefschetz hyperplane section theorem, inclusion C ÷í‚Üí X of any
smooth 1-dimensional plane section C of X induces a surjection AlbC ‚àí‚Üí
AlbX. This implies that B1X is embedded into B 1 (X) ‚äï B1C , so it is also of
finite length. ‚äì  ‚äî

Corollary 3.9. One has HomG (B q (L‚Ä≤ ‚äók F ), B p (L ‚äók F )) = 0 for any pair
of fields L, L‚Ä≤ finitely generated over k with tr.deg(L/k) = p, tr.deg(L‚Ä≤ /k) =
q and p 6= q.

Proof. If p > n, or q > n, then at least one of B q (L‚Ä≤ ‚äók F ) and B p (L ‚äók F )
is zero, so we may assume that max(p, q) ‚â§ n. By Proposition 3.8, the G-
modules B q (L‚Ä≤ ‚äók F ) and B p (L ‚äók F ) are semi-simple, so HomG (B q (L‚Ä≤ ‚äók
F ), B p (L ‚äók F )) is isomorphic to HomG (B p (L ‚äók F ), B q (L‚Ä≤ ‚äók F )), so we
may assume that p > q. Then, by Corollary 3.7, one has HomG (B q (L‚Ä≤ ‚äók
F ), B p (L ‚äók F )) = B p (L ‚äók L‚Ä≤ ) = 0. ‚äì

Proof. Let dim Y ‚â• dim X. Set n = dim Y . By Proposition 3.6,

               B dim X (Xk(Y ) ) = HomG (B n (YF ), B dim X (XF ))

and B n (Yk(X) ) = HomG (B dim X (XF ), B n (YF )). By Proposition 3.8, the

For any Œ± ‚àà B dim X (Xk(Y ) ) and Œ≤ ‚àà B n (Yk(X) ) set hŒ± ¬∑ Œ≤i = tr(Œ± ‚ó¶ Œ≤)

there is an element Œ≥ ‚àà B n (Yk(X) ) such that Œ± ‚ó¶ Œ≥ is a non-zero projector

    The above examples of G-modules are obtained from some (pro-)varieties
over k by extending the base field to F . More generally, one can construct a
G-module starting from some birationally invariant functor F on a category
of varieties over k, or on a category of field extensions of k (as in Corollary

    Divalg (YU ) is independent of the choice of YU , since any birational morphism
induces a homomorphism of the groups of algebraically trivial divisors, which is an
isomorphism of the subgroups of linearly trivial divisors (= multiplicative groups
of the function Ô¨Åelds modulo k√ó ) and induces an isomorphism of the quotients
modulo linear equivalence (= Pic‚ó¶ -groups).

Lemma 3.13. Let X, Y and Z be smooth irreducible k-varieties, dim X =
dim Y = n ‚â• dim Z, and p, q ‚â• 0 integers. Let
              p,q
             BX,Y,Z = HomH(U) (B q (Z √ók Y ), B p (k(X) ‚äók k(Y ))).
       p,q
Then BX,Y,Z  = 0, if either q = dim Z < p, or q = n and dim Z < p, or
q > n and p + q > dim Z + n, or q < p and q ‚àà {0, 1}.
Proof.
 ‚Äì Let dim Z = q < p. As B q (Z √ók Y ) = (BqZ,Y )U , it follows from the mov-
   ing lemma 3.4 that W1 := BqZ,Y is a quotient of the module Z q (k(Z) ‚äók
   F ) (since W1U = W U , where W is the quotient of Z q (k(Z) ‚äók F )
   by its G-submodule generated by the kernel of Z q (k(Z) ‚äók k(Y )) ‚àí‚Üí
   B q (Z √ók Y )).
   As HomG (Z q (k(Z) ‚äók F ), B p (k(X) ‚äók F )) = 0, this gives
                         HomG (W1 , B p (k(X) ‚äók F )) = 0.
  We need to show that HomH(U) (W U , B p (k(X) ‚äók k(Y ))) = 0.
  By Proposition 3.1, for any pair (W1 , W2 ) of semi-simple G-modules
  the natural homomorphism HomG (W1 , W2 ) ‚àí‚Üí HomH(U) (W1U , W2U ) is
  surjective. Then, as its source is zero when W2 = B p (k(X) ‚äók F ), we
  get the vanishing of the space HomH(U) ((BqZ,Y )U , B p (k(X) ‚äók k(Y ))).
‚Äì Let c = n ‚àí dim Z, so the variety Z √ó Pc is n-dimensional. As there is
  an embedding of H(U )-modules B n (Z √ók Y ) ÷í‚Üí B n (Z √ók Pc √ók Y ), it
                                           p,n
  is enough to show the vanishing of BX,Y,Z√óP    c for p > dim Z. By semi-

  simplicity, the latter is a subgroup in HomG (BnZ√óPc ,Y , B p (k(X)‚äók F )) ‚äÜ
  HomG (Z n (k(Z √ó Pc ) ‚äók F ), B p (k(X) ‚äók F )). By Proposition 3.6, the
  latter coincides with B p (k(X) ‚äók k(Z √ó Pc )), which is dominated by
                        ‚àº                                         p,n
  B p (Ack(X)‚äók k(Z) ) ‚Üê‚àí B p (k(X) ‚äók k(Z)) = 0, and thus, BX,Y,Z       = 0, if
  p > dim Z.                L           n e
‚Äì As the H(U )-module          D‚ààZ q‚àín B (D √ók Y ) surjects onto the H(U )-
                                                           p,q
  module B q (Z √ók Y ) when q > n, the vanishing of BX,Y,Z         follows from
    p,n
  B      e = 0 for each subvariety D of codimension q ‚àí n on Z.
     X,Y,D
‚Äì If q = 1 then B 1 (Z √ók Y ) is a subquotient of B 1 (C √ók Y ) for a smooth
  curve C, so we are reduced to the case q = dim Z < p. The case q = 0
  is trivial. ‚äì
              ‚äî
Proposition 3.14. Let X and Y be smooth irreducible varieties over k, and
either q ‚àà {0, 1, 2}, or q = dim X = dim Y . Then there is a unique
                                                                 submod-
ule in B q (X √ók Y ) over B dim X (X √ók X) ‚äó B dim Y (Y √ók Y )op isomorphic
to its quotient B q (k(X) ‚äók k(Y )).
Proof. The existence of such submodule follows from the semi-simplicity of
B q (X √ók Y ) ([Jan]). By Lemma 3.13,
                                     e √ók Y ), B q (k(X) ‚äók k(Y ))) = 0.
        HomB dim Y (Y √ók Y ) (B q‚àí1 (D
As the kernel of the projection B q (X √ók Y ) ‚àí‚Üí B q (k(X) ‚äók k(Y )) is gen-
erated by the images of B q‚àí1 (X √ók E)e and B q‚àí1 (De √ók Y ) for all divisors
D on X and all divisors E on Y , this implies the uniqueness. ‚äì  ‚äî

3.1 The projector ‚àÜk(X)

For any pair of varieties X, Y let t be the transposition of cycles, induced
            ‚àº
by X √ó Y ‚àí‚Üí Y √ó X. Denote by ‚àÜk(X) = t ‚àÜk(X) the identity (diagonal)
element in B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X)) considered as an element of B n (X √ók X).

Lemma 3.15. For any irreducible smooth proper k-variety X of dimension
n the element ‚àÜk(X) is a central projector in the algebra B n (X √ók X). The
left (equivalently, right) ideal generated by ‚àÜk(X) coincides with (the image
of ) B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X)).

Proof. Denote by œï the projection B n (X √ók X) ‚àí‚Üí B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X)) and
by œà its unique section B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X)) ‚àí‚Üí B n (X √ók X). The kernel of
œï coincides with the sum of the kernels of B n (X √ók X) ‚àí‚Üí B n (X √ók k(X))
and of B n (X √ók X) ‚àí‚Üí B n (k(X) √ók X), where the projections are induced
by the ring homomorphisms

            B n (X √ók X) ‚àí‚Üí EndG B n (X √ók F ) = B n (X √ók k(X))

and B n (X √ók X) ‚àí‚Üí EndG B n (F √ók X) = B n (k(X) √ók X), so ker œï is a
two-sided ideal. Then the image of œï is a B n (X √ók X)-bi-module, and thus,
the image of œà is a two-sided ideal in B n (X √ók X).
    As Œ± ‚ó¶ ‚àÜX = ‚àÜX ‚ó¶ Œ± for any Œ± ‚àà B n (X √ók X), and œï and œà are
morphisms of B n (X √ók X)-bi-modules, one has Œ±œà(œï(‚àÜX )) = œà(œï(Œ± ‚ó¶
‚àÜX )) = œà(œï(‚àÜX ‚ó¶ Œ±)) = œà(œï(‚àÜX ))Œ±, so Œ±‚àÜk(X) = ‚àÜk(X) Œ±. The B n (X √ók
X)-action on B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X)) factors through B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X)), so
‚àÜ2k(X) = ‚àÜX ‚àÜk(X) = ‚àÜk(X) . ‚äì  ‚äî

Lemma 3.16. ‚àÜk(X) B dim X (XL ) = B dim X (k(X) ‚äók L) for any irreducible
smooth proper k-variety X and any field extension L of k.

Proof. Set d = dim X. Using homotopy invariance and the Galois descent
property of B ‚àó , we may replace L by an algebraically closed extension F
with tr.deg(F/k) = n ‚â• d and then ‚àÜk(X) B d (XL ) = (‚àÜk(X) B d (XF ))GF/L
and B d (k(X) ‚äók L) = B d (k(X) ‚äók F )GF/L .
   By Proposition 3.6 and Corollary 3.7, the canonical maps

     B d (k(X) ‚äók k(X)) ‚àí‚Üí EndG B d (k(X) ‚äók F )
                                    ‚àí‚Üí HomG (B d (XF ), B d (k(X) ‚äók F ))

are isomorphisms. As ‚àÜk(X) is the identity element in EndG B d (k(X) ‚äók F ),
this means that ‚àÜk(X) B d (XF ) = B d (k(X) ‚äók F ). ‚äì
                                                    ‚äî

Proposition 3.17. (X, ‚àÜk(X) ) is the maximal primitive n-submotive of the
motive (X, ‚àÜX ) for any smooth irreducible proper n-dimensional k-variety
X. The motive (X, ‚àÜk(X) ) is a birational invariant of X.
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of Ô¨Åelds                   25


Proof. To show that (X, ‚àÜk(X) ) is a primitive n-motive, we have to check
that the Q-vector space W := ‚àÜk(X) B n (X √ók Y √ó P1 ) is zero for any variety
Y of dimension < n. Replacing Y with Y √ó Pn‚àídim Y ‚àí1 we may suppose
that dim Y = n ‚àí 1.
    W is a left B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X))-module, since by Lemma 3.15, ‚àÜk(X) is
a central projector in B n (X √ók X) and B n (X √ók X)‚àÜk(X) = B n (k(X) ‚äók
k(X)).
    In notations of Lemma 3.13 one has
                                                              n,n
  HomB n (X√ók X) (B n (X √ók Y √ó P1 ), B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X))) =: BX,X,Y √óP1
                                                       n,n
                                                             M    n,n‚àí1
                                                    = BX,X,Y     BX,X,Y .
                                          n,n‚àí1
By the first case of Lemma 3.13, one has BX,X,Y = 0; by the second case
                          n,n             n,n
of Lemma 3.13, one has BX,X,Y = 0, so BX,X,Y √óP1 = 0. Then the semi-
simplicity implies that

        HomB n (X√ók X) (B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X)), B n (X √ók Y √ó P1 )) = 0.

As W is a quotient of a direct sum of several copies of B n (k(X)‚äók k(X)), but
there are no non-zero B n (X √ók X)-module quotients of B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X))
in B n (X √ók Y √ó P1 ), this means that W = 0.
    For the maximality of (X, ‚àÜk(X) ) among primitive n-submotives of the
motive (X, ‚àÜX ), we have to show that Hom(M, X) = Hom(M, (X, ‚àÜk(X) ))
for any primitive n-motive M = (Z, œÄ). Hom(X, M ) = œÄB n (Z √ók X). For
any divisor D on X one has œÄB n‚àí1 (Z √ók D) e = 0, so from the exact sequence
    M
         œÄB n‚àí1 (Z √ók D)e ‚àí‚Üí œÄB n (Z √ók X) ‚àí‚Üí œÄB n (Z √ók k(X)) ‚àí‚Üí 0
   D‚ààX 1

we get œÄB n (Z √ók X) = œÄB n (Z √ók k(X)). By Proposition 3.6,

                B n (Z √ók k(X)) = HomG (B n (XF ), B n (ZF )),

so Hom(X, M ) = œÄHomG (B n (XF ), B n (ZF )). By Proposition 3.6, for any
divisor D on X one has

           HomG (B n‚àí1 (DF ), œÄB n (ZF )) = œÄB n‚àí1 (Z √ók k(D)) = 0,

so Hom(X, M ) = œÄHomG (B n (k(X) ‚äók F ), B n (ZF )). By Lemma 3.16, the
space B n (k(X)‚äók F ) coincides with the image of the projector ‚àÜk(X) acting
on B n (XF ), so

  Hom(X, M ) = œÄHomG (‚àÜk(X) B n (XF ), B n (ZF ))
                                      = œÄHomG (B n (XF ), B n (ZF ))‚àÜk(X) .

Since the space HomG (B n (XF ), B n (ZF )) is a quotient of B n (Z √ók X), we
get that the space Hom(X, M ) is a quotient of œÄB n (Z √ók X)‚àÜk(X) =
Hom((X, ‚àÜk(X) ), M ). On the other hand, the space Hom((X, ‚àÜk(X) ), M )
26                                                                     M.Rovinsky


is a quotient of Hom(X, M ). As both spaces are finite-dimensional, they
coincide.
    The birational invariantness of (X, ‚àÜk(X) ) follows from the birational
invariantness of Y prim for any smooth projective variety Y over k explained
in the beginning of ¬ß3.2 below.9 ‚äì ‚äî

Corollary 3.18. Let X and Y be smooth irreducible proper varieties over
k, and dim X = dim Y = n. Then the unique submodule         of the module
B n (X √ók Y ) over B dim X (X √ók X) ‚äó B dim Y (Y √ók Y )op isomorphic to its
quotient B n (k(X) ‚äók k(Y )) coincides with ‚àÜk(X) ¬∑ B n (X √ók Y ) = B n (X √ók
Y ) ¬∑ ‚àÜk(Y ) = ‚àÜk(X) ¬∑ B n (X √ók Y ) ¬∑ ‚àÜk(Y ) .

Proof. By Proposition 3.17, (X, ‚àÜk(X) ) and (Y, ‚àÜk(Y ) ) are the maximal
primitive n-submotives in (X, ‚àÜX ) and (Y, ‚àÜY ), so

              Hom(X, (Y, ‚àÜk(Y ) )) = Hom((X, ‚àÜk(X) ), (Y, ‚àÜk(Y ) )).

By definition,

     Hom(X, (Y, ‚àÜk(Y ) )) := B n (X √ók Y ) ¬∑ ‚àÜk(Y )
        and Hom((X, ‚àÜk(X) ), (Y, ‚àÜk(Y ) )) := ‚àÜk(X) ¬∑ B n (X √ók Y ) ¬∑ ‚àÜk(Y ) ,

and thus, B n (X √ók Y ) ¬∑ ‚àÜk(Y ) = ‚àÜk(X) ¬∑ B n (X √ók Y ) ¬∑ ‚àÜk(Y ) .
    Similarly, ‚àÜk(X) ¬∑ B n (X √ók Y ) = ‚àÜk(X) ¬∑ B n (X √ók Y ) ¬∑ ‚àÜk(Y ) .
    As in the proof of maximality of (X, ‚àÜk(X) ) in Proposition 3.17 we have
‚àÜk(X) ¬∑ B n (X √ók Y ) = ‚àÜk(X) ¬∑ B n (X √ók k(Y )). By Lemma 3.16 the latter
coincides with B n (k(X) ‚äók k(Y )). ‚äì ‚äî

Clearly, Y 7‚àí‚Üí Y prim is a functor from the category of smooth projective
varieties to the category of motives modulo numerical equivalence. Any
birational map is a composition of blow-ups and blow-downs with smooth
centers ([AKMW,W]). As a blow-up does not change Y prim (cf. [M]), this
implies that Y prim is an invariant of the function field k(Y ). According to
 9
   One can show this directly as follows. By Corollary 3.18, for any primitive
n-motive M ‚àº  = (Y, œÄ) with dim Y = n one has Hom(X, M ) := œÄB n (Y √ók X) =
œÄB n (k(Y ) √ók k(X)), which is independent of the model of k(X).

Hironaka, for any subfield L of F finitely generated over k there exists a
smooth projective variety Y[L] over k with the function field L, and therefore,
                                                           prim
one gets a canonical projective system of motives {Y[L]         }L indexed by
subfields L of F finitely generated over k.
                                     L [i]
    Now we define the functor B‚Ä¢ =     B of Theorem 1.1 from the category
of motives modulo numerical  equivalence to the category of graded Q-spaces
                               prim

Let also Bq denotes the restriction of B[0] to the subcategory of the primitive
                                                    prim             œÉ

    Remark. Any Grothendieck    L motive modulo‚äóinumerical equivalence M =

                                              = j Bj (Mij ).TOne proves this
by induction on dimension d of X as follows. Let M0d = œï ker(œï), where
œï runs over the set of morphisms from M to motives of type (Y √ó P1 , ‚àÜ)
for all Y with dim Y < d. (By Proposition 3.17, M0d = (X, œÄ ‚ó¶ ‚àÜk(X) ).)
As the length of M is ‚â§ dimQ End(M ) < ‚àû, the motive M/M0d can be
embedded into a finite direct sum of (Yj √ó P1 , ‚àÜ) with dim Yj < d. As
(Yj √ó P1 , ‚àÜ) = (Yj , ‚àÜ) ‚äï (Yj , ‚àÜ) ‚äó L, the induction is completed. In fact,

    As B[0] (M )UL = Hom Y[L] , M = œÄB q (X √ók Y[L] ) and œÄB q (XF )UL =

and any sufficiently big (with dim Y[L] ‚â• q) subfield L finitely generated
over k. We may assume that F is algebraic over L, so n < ‚àû. Then, by

  This implies that there exists a natural embedding of the    Q-algebra

  Using Proposition 3.17 one gets

By Corollary 3.18, the latter coincides with B q (k(X) ‚äók k(X)), which is the
same as EndG (œÄB q (XF )).
     By [Jan] and Lemma 3.2, the G-module B[0] (M ) is semi-simple. As
B (M ) surjects onto œÄB q (XF ) and EndG B[0] (M ) ‚äÜ EndG œÄB q (XF ), one

Proof. ‚àÜk(X) B d (X √ók Y ) = Hom(Y, (X, ‚àÜk(X) )). By Proposition 3.19,

3.3 ‚ÄúPolarization‚Äù on B n (k(X) ‚äók F ) and polarizable G-modules

Proposition 3.21. For any irreducible k-variety X of dimension n there
is a symmetric G-equivariant non-degenerate pairing

such that hp‚àó (¬∑), ¬∑ i = h ¬∑ , p‚àó (¬∑)i for any generically finite rational map p.
In particular, h , i induces non-degenerate pairings between the submodules
W := œÄB n (k(X) ‚äók F ) and t W := t œÄB n (k(X) ‚äók F ) for all projectors
œÄ ‚àà B n (k(X) ‚äók k(X)).
   If for (n ‚àí 1)-cycles on 2n-dimensional complex varieties the numerical
equivalence coincides with the homological one, then h , i is (‚àí1)n -definite.
In particular, this holds for n ‚â§ 2.

Proof. We may suppose that X is a smooth projective variety over k. For
a pair Œ±, Œ≥ ‚àà B n (k(X) ‚äók F ) fixed by a compact open subgroup U ‚äÇ G
we define hŒ±, Œ≥i ‚àà Q(œá) by hb    Œ±¬∑bŒ≥ i ¬∑ [U ], where Œ±  b are the images of Œ±, Œ≥ ‚àà

B n (k(X) ‚äók k(YU )) in B n (X √ók YU ) in the sense of Proposition 3.14. Here
YU is a smooth proper variety over k with the function field k(YU ) identified
with F U , and h ¬∑ i is the intersection form on B n (X√ók YU ). By the projection
formula, hŒ±, Œ≥i is independent of the choices, and hp‚àó (¬∑), ¬∑ i = h ¬∑ , p‚àó (¬∑)i.
    For a triplet of smooth proper varieties X1 , X2 , X3 , a triplet of integers
a, b, c ‚â• 0 with a + b + c = dim(X1 √ó X2 √ó X3 ) and a triplet Œ± ‚àà Aa (X1 √ó

hŒ± ¬∑ Œ≥ ‚ó¶ t Œ≤i. For any Œ± ‚àà W ‚àí {0} fixed by U there is Œ≤ ‚àà B n (X √ók YU )
such that hb  Œ± ¬∑ Œ≤i 6= 0. Then, as Œ±    b = œÄ‚ó¶Œ±   b ‚ó¶ ‚àÜk(YU ) , one has hb
                                                                          Œ± ¬∑ Œ≤i =
 Œ± ¬∑ t œÄ ‚ó¶ Œ≤ ‚ó¶ ‚àÜk(YU ) i 6= 0. As t œÄ ‚ó¶ Œ≤ ‚ó¶ ‚àÜk(YU ) ‚àà t W , this shows that
hb
h , i induces a non-degenerate pairing between W and t W for an arbitrary
projector œÄ.
    By Lemma 3.13, HomH(U) (B n+1 (X √ók YU ), B n (k(X)‚äók k(YU ))) = 0. By

B n+1 (X √ók YU ) is zero for any L ‚àà NS(X). Interchanging the roles of X

Proposition 3.22. Let V be a finite-dimensional Q-vector space with a
                                                        h   ,   i
positive definite symmetric pairing V ‚äó V ‚àí‚Üí Q and with an action
H ‚àí‚Üí GL(V ), p 7‚àí‚Üí œÉp of a subgroup H ‚äÜ Q√ó           + , generated by almost all
primes, such that hœÉp x, œÉp yi = p ¬∑ hx, yi for all x, y ‚àà V and for all p ‚àà H.
Then V = 0.
Proof. Since a Q-multiple of œÉp is orthogonal, œÉp is diagonizable over Q for
all p ‚àà H. As the group H is abelian, there is a basis {ei } of V ‚äó Q and
                                √ó
characters Œªi : H ‚àí‚Üí Q such that œÉr ei = Œªi (r)¬∑ei . Note, that the elements
ei belong to V ‚äó K for a finite extension K of Q, so the characters factor
as Œªi : H ‚àí‚Üí K √ó .
    For each embedding œÑ : K ÷í‚Üí C we define an hermitian form hx, yiœÑ :=
hœÑ x, œÑ yi, where h , i is the bilinear form on V ‚äó C induced by h , i
and       is the complex conjugation on V ‚äó C. One has 0 6= hœÉp ei , œÉp ei iœÑ =
œÑ (Œªi (p))œÑ (Œªi (p)) ¬∑ hei , ei iœÑ = p ¬∑ hei , ei iœÑ , so |œÑ (Œªi (p))| = p1/2 for any œÑ .
    Let L be the subfield in the normalization of K over Q generated by
all the conjugates over Q of the image of Œª1 , so L is a Galois extension of
Q. For any embedding œÑ : K ÷í‚Üí C the image of L in C is invariant under
the complex conjugation, since œÑ Œª1 (p) = p ¬∑ (œÑ Œª1 (p))‚àí1 . As the latter does
not depend on the embedding, the complex conjugation induces an element
c in the center of Gal(L/Q). L cannot be totally real, since then it would
contain elements p1/2 for almost all prime p, and thus it would be ‚àö               of infinite
degree. As the field of invariants R of c is totally real, L = R( ‚àíŒ±) for
some totally positive integer Œ± ‚àà OR . Let d = [R : Q].
    As the subgroup {1, c} is normal in Gal(L/Q), the field R is a Galois
extension of Q. By the ChebotareÃàv density theorem, there are infinitely
many rational primes p corresponding to the element (=the conjugacy class
of) c. As restriction of c to R is trivial, such ideals (p) split completely in the
extension R/Q, i.e., (p) = ‚Ñò1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚Ñòd . On the other hand the ideals ‚Ñò1 , . . . , ‚Ñòd
stay prime in the extension L/R (one of them should stay prime, since c is
non-trivial, and the others lie in the Gal(L/Q)-orbit of such one).
    Now let integers x, y ‚àà OR be such that x2 +                       2
                                                                  ‚àö Œ±y ‚àà (p) ‚äÜ ‚Ñòj for any
j.
‚àö  Since    ‚Ñò j remains    prime    in O   ,
                                          L ‚àö one    has  x  +  y   ‚àíŒ±   ‚àà ‚Ñòj for a choice of
   ‚àíŒ±. Since ‚Ñòj is c-invariant, 2x, 2y ‚àíŒ± ‚àà ‚Ñòj , and thus, x, y ‚àà ‚Ñòj for p big
enough with respect to Œ±. So we get x, y ‚àà ‚Ñò1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚Ñòd = (p).
    If there is an element in L with the modulus p1/2 with respect to any
complex embedding of L, then there are non-zero integers x, y, z ‚àà OR of
minimal possible norm of xyz such that x2 +Œ±y 2 = pz 2 . As this implies z 2 ‚àà
(p), one should also have z ‚àà (p) if L is unramified over p, and therefore, the
triplet (x/p, y/p, z/p) also satisfies the above conditions and has a smaller
‚Äúnorm‚Äù. This is contradiction. ‚äì           ‚äî

   We shall say that an admissible G-module W is polarizable (when n <
‚àû) if there is a symmetric positive definite G-equivariant pairing W ‚äóW ‚àí‚Üí
Q(œá).
Corollary 3.23. Let W be a polarizable G-module. Let L be an extension
of k in F . Then W UL(x) = 0 for any x ‚àà F transcendental over L.
Proof. Since W is smooth, there is a finitely generated extension L1 of
k such that the stabilizer of an element w ‚àà W UL(x) contains the open
subgroup hUL1 , UL(x) i. By Lemma 2.1, the latter contains UL2 (x)‚à©L3 (x) =
UL4 (x) , where L3 is generated over L by a transcendence basis of F over
L(x), L2 is generated
                T       over L1 by a transcendence basis of L3 over k, and
L4 := L2 (x) L3 is finitely generated over k. We replace L by L4 , thus
assuming, that L is finitely generated over k.
    As UL(x) ‚äÇ UL(xp ) = œÉUL(x) œÉ ‚àí1 , where œÉx = xp and œÉ|L = id, the
                                               ‚àº
element œÉ induces an isomorphism W UL(x) ‚àí‚Üí W UL(xp ) , and W UL(xp ) ‚äÜ
   UL(x)
W        , the dimension argument shows that œÉ induces an automorphism of
W UL(x) . For any w ‚àà W one has hœÉw, œÉwi = œá(œÉ) ¬∑ hw, wi, so Proposition
3.22 says that W UL(x) = 0. ‚äì ‚äî
Corollary 3.24. Any finite-dimensional polarizable G-module is zero.
Proof. This follows from Corollary 2.10 and Corollary 3.23.       ‚äì

4 Morphisms between certain G-modules and matrix coefficients

4.1 Two remarks on the G-modules F/k and F √ó /k √ó

Proposition 4.1. For any 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ ‚àû the G‚ó¶ -modules F/k and F √ó /k √ó
are irreducible.
Proof. Let A be the additive subgroup of F generated by the G‚ó¶ -orbit of
some x ‚àà F ‚àí k. For any y ‚àà A ‚àí k one has y22‚àí1 = y‚àí1     1      1
                                                             ‚àí y+1        1
                                                                    . As y‚àí1  and
  1               ‚ó¶                                   2
y+1  are in the  G  -orbit of y, this  implies that y   ‚àà A. As for  any y, z ‚àà A
               1         2            2
one has yz = 4 ((y + z) ‚àí (y ‚àí z) ), the group A is a subring of F .
    Let M be the multiplicative subgroup of F √ó generated by the G‚ó¶ -orbit
of some x ‚àà F ‚àí k. Then for any y, z ‚ààSM one has y + z = z(y/z + 1), so if
y/z 6‚àà k then y + z ‚àà M , and thus, M {0} is a G‚ó¶ -invariant subring of F .
    Since the G‚ó¶ -orbit of an element x ‚àà F ‚àí k contains all elements of
F ‚àí k(x), if n ‚â• 2 then each element of F is the sum of a pair of elements in
the orbit. Any G‚ó¶ -invariant subring in F , but not in k, is a k-subalgebra, so
if n = 1 then Gal(F/Q(G‚ó¶ x)) ‚äÇ G‚ó¶ is a compact subgroup normalized by
G‚ó¶ . Then by Theorem 2.9 we have Gal(F/Q(G‚ó¶ x)) = {1}. As any element of
Q(G‚ó¶ x) is the fraction of a pair of elements in Z[G‚ó¶ x] and for any y ‚àà F ‚àí k
the element 1/y belongs to the G‚ó¶ -orbit of y, one has Z[G‚ó¶ x] = F . ‚äì      ‚äî
Proposition 4.2. For any 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ ‚àû the annihilator of F/k in Dk and
the annihilator of F √ó /k √ó in DQ are trivial.

          P
Proof. Let Nj=1 aj ¬∑ œÉj be the image of some Œ± ‚àà DE in E[G/UL ] for an
open subgroup UL , an integer N ‚â• 1, some aj ‚àà E and some pairwise
                                     /k
distinct embeddings œÉj : L ÷í‚Üí F . Here E is either k, or Q. Let œÑ ‚àà G be
such an element that the embeddings œÉ1 , . . . , œÉN , œÑ œÉ1 , . . . , œÑ œÉN are pairwise
distinct.                                                        PN
    Suppose Œ± annihilates F/k. For any x ‚àà L one has j=1 aj ¬∑ œÉj x ‚àà k,
             PN                  PN
and thus, j=1 aj ¬∑ œÉj x + j=1 (‚àíaj ) ¬∑ œÑ œÉj x = 0 for all x ‚àà L. Then, by
Artin‚Äôs theorem on independence of characters, a1 = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = aN = 0.
    Similarly, suppose that Œ± annihilates F √ó /k √ó . We may suppose that aj ‚àà
                                  QN                                 Q2N
Z. For any x ‚àà L√ó one has j=1 (œÉj x)aj ‚àà k √ó , and thus, j=1 (œÉj x)aj = 1
for all x ‚àà L√ó , where œÉj = œÑ œÉj‚àíN and aj = ‚àíaj‚àíN for N < j ‚â§ 2N .
    Let œÑ1 , . . . , œÑM be a collection of pairwise distinct embeddings P    of L into
F and b1 , . . . , bM be such a collection of non-zero integers that M         j=1 |bj |
                                          QM         bj                       √ó
is minimal among those for which j=1 (œÑj x) = 1 for all x ‚àà L . Then
QM                  bj
                        QM          bj
   j=1 (œÑj x + 1) ‚àí       j=1 (œÑj x)   = 0, which is equivalent to

      j:bj >0              j:bj <0             j:bj >0          j:bj <0

                      P                    QM
We rewrite this as c1 ,...,cM Ac1 ,...,cM j=1 (œÑj x)cj = 0, where 0 ‚â§ cj ‚â§ |bj |
      PM          PM
and j=1 cj < j=1 |bj |. Then Ac1 ,...,cM are integers which are all non-zero
if either cj = bj for all j with bj > 0, or cj = ‚àíbj for all j with bj < 0. By
                                                        Q                Q              c‚Ä≤j
Artin‚Äôs theorem on independence of characters, M          j=1 (œÑj x)
                                                                    cj
                                                                       = M   j=1 (œÑj x)
for a pair of distinct collections (cj ) and (c‚Ä≤j ) as before, with |cj ‚àíc‚Ä≤j | < |bj | for

some j, and for all x ‚àà L. But then j=1 |cj ‚àíc‚Ä≤j | < j=1 |bj |, contradicting

4.2 Morphisms between certain G- and G‚ó¶ -modules

Proposition 4.3. Let A and B be simple commutative group schemes over
k. Then for any 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ ‚àû
                                          ‚àº                        ‚àº
     Homgroup   schemes/k (A, B)Q     ‚àí‚Üí HomG (WA , WB ) ‚àí‚Üí HomG‚ó¶ (WA , WB ).

Proof.
1. First, consider the cases A, B ‚àà {Ga , Gm }. Let œï ‚àà HomG‚ó¶ (WA , WB )
                                                                        ‚ó¶
   and x ‚àà WA ‚àí {0}. Then œï(x) is fixed by the stabilizer
                                                        T St‚ó¶x of x in G .
   The group Stx fits intoTan exact sequence 1 ‚àí‚Üí Uk(x) G ‚àí‚Üí Stx ‚àí‚Üí
                            U        G‚ó¶
      A(k) ‚àí‚Üí 1. As WB k(x)        = (B(k(x))/B(k))Q and A(k) acts on k(x) by
                                                                          A(k)
      the affine linear substitutions of x, one has WBStx = (B(k(x))/B(k))Q .
                                                                       √ó
       ‚Äì If A = Gm and B = Ga then WBStx = (k(x)/k)k = 0, so œï = 0.
       ‚Äì If A = Ga and B = Gm then WBStx = (k(x)√ó /k √ó )kQ = 0, so œï = 0.

                                                                      √ó
    ‚Äì If A = B = Gm then WBStx = (k(x)√ó /k √ó )kQ = {xŒª | Œª ‚àà Q}, so
      œï(x) = xŒª for some Œª ‚àà Q. This implies that œï(œÉx) = (œÉx)Œª for all
      œÉ ‚àà G‚ó¶ . As F √ó /k √ó is an irreducible G‚ó¶ -module, one has œïy = y Œª for
      all y ‚àà F √ó /k √ó .
    ‚Äì If A = B = Ga then WBStx = (k(x)/k)k = {Œª ¬∑ x | Œª ‚àà k}, so
      œï(x) = Œª ¬∑ x for some Œª ‚àà k. This implies that œï(œÉx) = Œª ¬∑ œÉx for all
      œÉ ‚àà G‚ó¶ . As F/k is an irreducible G‚ó¶ -module, one has œïy = Œª ¬∑ y for
      all y ‚àà F/k.
2. Fix a smooth irreducible curve Z ‚äÜ A over k. For any generic point
             /k                                                       œï
   x : k(Z) ÷í‚Üí F and any G‚ó¶ -homomorphism WA ‚àí‚Üí WB the element œï(x)
                                           ‚ó¶
                            U         ‚à©G
   belongs to the space WB x(k(Z))             = (B(x(k(Z)))/B(k))Q , and therefore,
                                                                            hx
   there is an integer Nx ‚â• 1 and a rational map Z ‚àí‚àí ‚Üí B defined over
   k such that œï(x) = N1x hx (x). This implies that if œï 6= 0 and either
   A = Gm or A = Ga then B = Gm or B = Ga .
3. Now suppose that A and B are simple abelian varieties over k. Then the
                                                 œïx
   maps hx are regular and factor as Z ‚àí‚Üí JZ ‚àí‚Üí B for some homomor-
   phisms œïx from the Jacobian JZ .
4. If A and B are not isogeneous, there is such a curve Z that any homo-
   morphism of the group schemes JZ ‚àí‚Üí B is trivial, and thus œï(x) = 0,
   so we may suppose that A = B.
5. There is such a curve Z that
                                                  ‚àº
       EndA := Endgroup     scheme/k (A)Q       ‚àí‚Üí Homgroup               schemes/k (JZ , A)Q .

   Then one can consider œïx as an element of EndA , i.e., œï(x) = N1x œïx (x).
6. For any pair of generic points x1 , x2 ‚àà Z(F ) there are generic points
                             t, y1 , . . . , yM , z1 , . . . , zM ‚Ä≤
   of Z(F ) such that the elements of both collections (x1 , t, y1 , . . . , yM )
   and (x2 , t, z1 , . . . , zM ‚Ä≤ ) are
                                     P linearly independent P in WA over the algebra
   EndA , and u := x1 + t + j yj and v := x2 + t + j zj are generic points
   of Z(F ).
   Then, by definition, œï(u) coincides with
                                        Ô£´                                Ô£∂
                  1                   1 Ô£≠                     X
                       œïu (u) =           œïu (x1 ) + œïu (t) +    œïu (yj )Ô£∏ ,
                 Nu                  Nu                       j

                                                 1
   and, as œï is a homomorphism, œï =             N x1   œïx1 (x1 )+ N1t œït (t)+ N1y œïy1 (y1 )+
                                                                                      1
   ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + Ny1 œïyM (yM ). We can assume that Nu = Nv = Nx1 = Nx2 = Nt .
              M
   Then one has œïu = œïx1 = œït . Similarly, one has œïv = œïx2 = œït , and
   therefore, the restriction of œï to the set of generic points of Z coincides
   with the restriction of œà to the set of generic points of Z, for some
   œà ‚àà EndA .
   As generic points of Z generate A(F ) as an abstract group, this implies
   that œï = œà, i.e., that œï ‚àà EndA .

7. There remain the cases where A is an abelian variety and B is ei-
   ther Ga or Gm . As WB is an irreducible G‚ó¶ -module, any non-zero G‚ó¶ -
   homomorphism to WB is surjective. Any surjection of smooth represen-
   tations of G‚ó¶ induces a surjection of their subspaces fixed by a compact
   subgroup K of G. Taking K = UL‚Ä≤ , where L‚Ä≤ is a purely transcendental
   extension of k, we get contradiction showing that HomG‚ó¶ (WA , WB ) = 0.

Corollary 4.4. For any pair of pure 1-motives M1 , M2 one has

       HomG (B1 (M1 ), B1 (M2 )) = HomG‚ó¶ (B1 (M1 ), B1 (M2 )).          ‚äì
                                                                        ‚äî

Corollary 4.5. For any G-module W there is at most 1 character œà such
that W (œà) ‚àº
           = B1 (M ) for a pure 1-motive M .

Proof. Suppose that W is irreducible, W (œà1 ) =‚àº B1 (M1 ), W (œà2 ) ‚àº
                                                                   = B1 (M2 )
for some pure 1-motives M1 and M2 and some characters œà1 6= œà2 . By the
fully faithfulness and the previous corollary,

 Hom(M1 , M2 ) = HomG (B1 (M1 ), B1 (M2 )) = HomG‚ó¶ (B1 (M1 ), B1 (M2 )),

so Hom(M1 , M2 ) = HomG‚ó¶ (W (œà1 ), W (œà2 )), which non-zero, since the G‚ó¶ -
modules W (œà1 ) and W (œà2 ) are isomorphic, and thus, M1 and M2 are iso-
morphic, which implies that W (œà1 ) ‚àº
                                    = W (œà2 ) as G-modules. We may as-
sume that œà2 = 1. Set œà = œà1 6= 1.
    The G-module W (œà) coincides with W as a vector space, but G acts by
(œÉ, w) 7‚àí‚Üí œà(œÉ) ¬∑ œÉw. Suppose that there is an isomorphism W ‚àí‚Üí W (œà),
                             Œª
i.e., an automorphism W ‚àí‚Üí W such that Œª(œÉw) = œà(œÉ) ¬∑ œÉŒª(w). Then Œª
can be considered as an element of Endker œà (W ). As ker œà contains G‚ó¶ , the
automorphism Œª can also be considered as an element of EndG‚ó¶ (W ).
     This implies that EndG‚ó¶ (W ) 6= EndG (W ), contradicting the previous
corollary.
     If W is not irreducible, it should be semi-simple anyway, so its irreducible
summands are motivic, implying the Corollary. ‚äì       ‚äî


4.3 Non-compactness of supports of matrix coefficients

A matrix coefficient of a smooth representation W of a topological group is
a function on the group of type hœÉw, wi

in the dual representation with open stabilizer.
Proposition 4.6. Suppose that n < ‚àû, a subgroup H of G contains G‚ó¶ and
the supports of the matrix coefficients of a representation of H are compact.
Then this representation is zero.
Proof. Let C be an algebraically closed extension of k of cardinality strictly
greater than the cardinality of k. Let œâ 6= 0 be an irreducible representation
of H over C with compact supports of the matrix coefficients. We may

replace H by G‚ó¶ , and replace œâ by an irreducible subquotient of œâ|G‚ó¶ . Let
N be a compact open subgroup in G‚ó¶ such that œâ(hN ) 6= 0.
    Along the same lines as, e.g., in Claim 2.11 of [BZ], one proves the Schur‚Äôs
lemma: the endomorphisms of a smooth irreducible C-representation of G‚ó¶
are scalar. This allows one to modify Theorem 2.42 a) of [BZ] as follows. For
each open compact subgroup N in G‚ó¶ there is an element Œµœâ     N ‚àà DC such that
œâ(ŒµœâN ) = œâ(h N ) and  œÄ(Œµ œâ
                           N ) = 0 for any smooth  irreducible C-representation
œÄ of G‚ó¶ distinct from œâ.
    As the G‚ó¶ -module F √ó /k √ó is irreducible, and EndG‚ó¶ (F √ó /k √ó ) = Q, the
C-representation œÄ = (F √ó /k √ó ) ‚äó C of G‚ó¶ is irreducible.10 On the other
hand, the support of the matrix coefficient hœÉx, wi  e is not compact for any
x ‚àà F √ó /k √ó ‚àí {1} and any vector w    e 6= 0 in the representation dual to œÄ,
since the stabilizer of x is not compact. This implies that there is an element
Œµ ‚àà DC such that œâ(Œµ) = œâ(hN ) and œÄ(Œµ) = 0, contradicting Proposition

5 Some examples of (co-)homological calculations

5.1 Examples of Ext-calculation and torsors

Let SmG be the category of smooth G-modules. It is a full abelian subcat-
egory in the category of G-modules.
Proposition 5.1. Let n = ‚àû and A be an irreducible commutative alge-
braic group over k.
    Then Ext1SmG (A(F )Q , Q) = Ext1G,cont (A(F )Q , Q) = 0.
Proof. Let 0 ‚àí‚Üí Q ‚àí‚Üí E ‚àí‚Üí A(F )Q ‚àí‚Üí 0 be a continuous extension,
                                                                    s
i.e., with closed stabilizers.
                           L   A choice of a linear section A(F )Q ÷í‚Üí E de-
fines a splitting E ‚àº= Q A(F )Q as a Q-vector space. The G-action is
given by œÉ(b, x) = (b + aœÉ (x), œÉx), where aœÉ (x + y) = aœÉ (x) + aœÉ (y) and
aœÉ (œÑ x) + aœÑ (x) = aœÉœÑ (x). E is continuous if and only if the subgroup
{œÉ ‚àà Stabx | aœÉ (x) = 0} is closed for any x ‚àà A(F )Q . In particular, the
            a(x)
map Stabx ‚àí‚Üí Q given by œÉ 7‚àí‚Üí aœÉ (x) is a homomorphism with closed
kernel. As a(x) is continuous, the image of any compact subgroup of Uk(x)
is a compact subgroup in Q, i.e., 0. By Lemma 2.8, the subgroup gener-
ated by compact subgroups is dense in Uk(x) , so Uk(x) is in the kernel of
a(x), and thus, a(x) factors through Stabx /Uk(x) ‚äÜ A(k)tors . Since any
homomorphism from any torsion group to Q is zero, we get aœÉ (x) = 0
for any œÉ ‚àà Stabx , and therefore, Stab(b,y) = Staby for any (b, y) ‚àà E.
This implies also that for any y ‚àà A(F )Q , any œÑ ‚àà G and any œÉ ‚àà Staby
one has aœÑ œÉ (y) = aœÑ (y). In particular, if x is a generic point of A and
H = {œÑ ‚àà G | œÑ x = ¬µ ¬∑ x for some ¬µ ‚àà Q√ó }, then a(x) : H ‚àí‚Üí Q factors

    Variant: F/k is an irreducible G‚ó¶ -module, DQ ÷í‚Üí Endk (F/k), EndG‚ó¶ (F/k) =
k, and therefore, (F/k) ‚äók C is an irreducible C[G‚ó¶ ]-module.

through Q√ó ‚àí‚Üí Q and p ¬∑ aœÑ (x) + aœÉ (x) = aœÑ œÉ (x) for any œÉ, œÑ ‚àà G such
that œÉx = p ¬∑ x and œÑ x = q ¬∑ x for some p, q ‚àà Q√ó . Then aœÉ (x) = (p ‚àí 1) ¬∑ c(x)
for some c(x) ‚àà Q. Clearly, c(m ¬∑ x) = m ¬∑ c(x) for any m ‚àà Q√ó .
    Note, that c( ) is linear on the set of generic points of A. Indeed, if
                                                          /k
x and y (considered as embeddings x, y : k(A) ÷í‚Üí F ) are algebraically
independent over k (i.e., k(x, y) := x(k(A))y(k(A)) ‚äÇ F is of transcendence
degree 2 dim A over k) then there is an element œÉ ‚àà G such that œÉx = 2 ¬∑ x
and œÉy = 2¬∑y, so aœÉ (x) = c(x), aœÉ (y) = c(y), and aœÉ (x+y) = c(x+y), so, by
additivity of aœÉ , one has c(x + y) = c(x) + c(y). In general, for any collection
of generic points x1 , . . . , xN there is some z ‚àà A(F ) such that the subfield
k(z, x1 , . . . , xN ) of F is of transcendence degree dim A over k(x1 , . . . , xN ).
                                    P                         PN
By induction on N , one has N         j=1 mj ¬∑ c(xj ) = c(z +      mj ¬∑ xj ) ‚àí c(z).
                      PN                                  PN j=1
In particular, if j=1 mj ¬∑ xj = 0 this means that j=1 mj ¬∑ c(xj ) = 0. This
implies that c( ) extends to a linear functional on A(F )Q .
    Subtracting the coboundary of c( ), we may assume that aœÉ (y) = 0 for
any generic point y ‚àà A(F ) and any œÉ ‚àà G such that œÉy = ¬µ ¬∑ y for some
¬µ ‚àà Q√ó .
    Fix a generic point y ‚àà A(F ). Any G-equivariant section over the subset
                                              Œ±y,b
of generic points of A is of type œÉy 7‚àí‚Üí œÉ(b, y) for some b ‚àà Q. As G
acts transitively on the set of generic points of A, and the stabilizers of
vectors in E coincide with the stabilizers of their projections to A(F )Q , this
section is well-defined. For any ¬µ ‚àà Q√ó let œÑ¬µ ‚àà G be such an element that
œÑ¬µ y = ¬µ ¬∑ y. Then Œ±y,b (¬µ ¬∑ œÉy) = Œ±y,b (œÉœÑ¬µ y) = œÉœÑ¬µ Œ±y,b (y) = œÉœÑ¬µ (b, y) =
(b + aœÉœÑ¬µ (y), œÉœÑ¬µ y) = (b + aœÉ (œÑ¬µ y), œÉœÑ¬µ y) = ¬µ ¬∑ (b/¬µ + aœÉ (y), œÉy), since
aœÑ¬µ (y) = 0, so Œ±y,b (¬µ ¬∑ x) = ¬µ ¬∑ Œ±y,b (x) for any generic point x ‚àà A(F )
and any ¬µ ‚àà Q√ó if and only if b = 0, i.e., Œ±y,0 is the unique G-equivariant
homogeneous (but, a priori, non-linear) section over the subset of generic
points of A. As Œ±œÉy,0 is also a G-equivariant homogeneous section over
the subset of generic points of A for arbitrary œÉ ‚àà G, one has Œ±y,0 (œÉy) =
(aœÉ (y), œÉy) = Œ±œÉy,0 (œÉy) = (0, œÉy), so aœÉ (y) = 0 for any œÉ ‚àà G and any
generic point y. Since any element of A(F )Q is a sum of generic points of
A, we get aœÉ (z) = 0 for any œÉ ‚àà G and any z ‚àà A(F )Q . ‚äì        ‚äî

Corollary 5.2. Let n = ‚àû and A be an irreducible commutative algebraic
group over k. Then one has

           Ext1SmG (WA , Q) = Ext1G,cont (WA , Q) = Hom(A(k), Q).

Proof. The functor RHom(‚àí, Q) applied to 0 ‚àí‚Üí A(k)Q ‚àí‚Üí A(F )Q ‚àí‚Üí
WA ‚àí‚Üí 0 gives an exact sequence Hom(A(F )Q , Q) ‚àí‚Üí Hom(A(k)Q , Q) ‚àí‚Üí
Ext1 (WA , Q) ‚àí‚Üí Ext1 (A(F )Q , Q), where the exterior groups are zero by
Proposition 5.1. ‚äì
                 ‚äî

Lemma 5.3. Let n = ‚àû, and either A = Gm , or A = Ga .
  Then Ext1SmG (Q, WA ) = 0.
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of Ô¨Åelds                    37


Proof. Let 0 ‚àí‚Üí WA ‚àí‚Üí E ‚àí‚Üí Q ‚àí‚Üí 0 be an exact sequence in SmG . The
stabilizer of an element of E projecting to 1 ‚àà Q contains an open subgroup
UL , so E is a sum of WA and a quotient of Q[G/UL ] by a submodule in the
group Q[G/UL ]‚ó¶ of degree-zero 0-cycles.
    When restricted to Q[G/UL ]‚ó¶ , the projection Q[G/UL ] ‚àí‚Üí E factors
through WA . Denote it by Œ±. Fix elements œÉ, œÑ ‚àà G such that L, œÉ(L) and
œÑ œÉ(L) are in general position, œÉ|L = œÑ |L and œÉ 2 |L = id. Then the generator
[1] ‚àí [œÉ] of Q[G/UL ]‚ó¶ is fixed by ULœÉ(L) , and therefore,

  Œ±([1] ‚àí [œÉ]) = f (x, y) ‚àà (A(LœÉ(L))/A(k))Q ,
             Œ±([œÉ] ‚àí [œÑ œÉ]) = f (y, z) ‚àà (A(œÉ(L)œÑ œÉ(L))/A(k)) Q ,
                            Œ±([1] ‚àí [œÑ œÉ]) = f (x, z) ‚àà (A(LœÑ œÉ(L))/A(k))Q ,
where f (‚àí, ‚àí) is a rational function and x, y, z denote collections of elements
                                                                              ‚àÇ2
in L, œÉ(L), œÑ œÉ(L), respectively. Then f (x, y)+f (y, z) = f (x, z). Taking ‚àÇx‚àÇz
                            ‚àÇ       ‚àÇ
in the case A = Ga , or ‚àÇx    log ¬∑ ‚àÇz log in the case A = Gm , we get f (x, z) =
f (x) + g(z). As œÉ([1] ‚àí [œÉ]) = ‚àí([1] ‚àí [œÉ]), one has f (x, y) = ‚àíf (y, x), and
thus, f (x, y) = f (x)‚àíf (y) for some f (x) ‚àà L. Let Œ≤ ‚àà G be such an element
that Œ≤f (x) = 2f (x) (in the sense of the group law of A). Then the image of
2 ¬∑ [1] ‚àí [Œ≤] in E is fixed by G and projects to 1 ‚àà Q, so E ‚àº  = Q ‚äï WA . ‚äì   ‚äî

    It will follow from Propositions 6.4 and 6.15 that Ext1SmG (Q, W ) = 0 for
any admissible representation W of G in the case n = ‚àû. (More generally,
                        q                           q
if n = ‚àû, W1 , W2 ‚àà IG    and W1 is projective in IG  then, using Lemma 6.6,
we get ExtSmG (W1 , W2 ) = ExtSmG (W1 , W2 ) = Ext1I q (W1 , W2 ) = 0. Now

   In the next example, we wish to show that Ext1SmG (WA , WGm ) 6= 0 for
any abelian variety A over k. The G-module Div‚ó¶Q = lim Divalg (YU )Q , intro-

duced before Proposition 3.11, fits into the exact sequence 0 ‚àí‚Üí F √ó /k √ó ‚àí‚Üí
Div‚ó¶Q ‚àí‚Üí Pic‚ó¶Q ‚àí‚Üí 0. By Proposition 3.11, any non-zero element of A‚à® (k)Q
determines an embedding of WA into Pic‚ó¶Q , thus inducing an extension of
WA by WGm inside Div‚ó¶Q . This extension is non-split, since any generic
F -point x of A, considered as an element of A(F )Q , identifies the space
HomG (A(F )Q , Div‚ó¶Q ) with a subspace in (Div‚ó¶Q )Stabx which is the same as
                    htranslations by torsion elements in A(k)i
          Divalg (A)Q                                          = 0.

    For a smooth G-group A denote by HSm        (G, A) the set of isomorphism
classes of smooth G-torsors under A, i.e., the set of classes of those G-torsors
in H 1 (G, A) that become trivial on an open subgroup of G.
    In particular, H 1 (G, GLr F ) is the set of isomorphism classes of semi-

linear r-dimensional representations of G over F , and HSm      (G, GLr F ) is its

Proposition 5.4. If n = ‚àû then HSm (G, A(F )) = {‚àó} for any algebraic
group A over k.

                                                        1
Proof. For any 1-cocycle (aœÉ ) presenting a class in HSm  (G, A(F )) there is
an extension L of k in F of finite type such that aŒæ = 1 for any Œæ ‚àà UL ,
so, as aœÉœÑ = aœÉ ¬∑ œÉaœÑ , a is a function on G/UL , and aœÉ ‚àà A(LœÉ(L)) for any
œÉ ‚àà G.
                    /k
     For any œÑ : L ÷í‚Üí F in general position with respect to L there is some
       /k
œÉ : L ÷í‚Üí F such that œÉ(L) and œÉœÑ (L) are in general position with respect to
L. Set F ‚Ä≤ = œÉ(L)œÑ (L)œÉœÑ (L) ‚äÇ F . There is an F ‚Ä≤ -subalgebra R of finite type
                                                                            T
in LF ‚Ä≤ ‚äÇ F with the fraction field LF ‚Ä≤ such that the fraction field of R L
coincides with L and aœÉ , aœÑ , aœÉœÑ ‚àà A(R). There is a ring homomorphism
    s                                                            T
R ‚àí‚Üí F ‚Ä≤ identical on F ‚Ä≤ and inducing a homomorphism R L ‚àí‚Üí k, so
s(aŒæ ) ‚àà A(Œæ(L)) if Œæ ‚àà {œÉ, œÑ, œÉœÑ }.
    Clearly, œÉaœÑ ‚àà A(F ‚Ä≤ ), so s(aœÉœÑ ) = s(aœÉ ¬∑ œÉaœÑ ) = s(aœÉ ) ¬∑ œÉaœÑ , and thus,
aœÑ = œÉ ‚àí1 s(aœÉ )‚àí1 ¬∑ œÉ ‚àí1 s(aœÉœÑ ). This implies that aœÑ = fœÉ‚àí1 ¬∑ œÑ fœÉœÑ , where
fŒæ := Œæ ‚àí1 s(aŒæ ) ‚àà A(L) and Œæ ‚àà {œÉ, œÉœÑ }.
                                     /k
     In other words, for any œÑ : L ÷í‚Üí F in general position with respect to L
                                                                    /k
there exist gœÑ , hœÑ ‚àà A(L) such that aœÑ = gœÑ ¬∑ œÑ hœÑ . Any œÉ : L ÷í‚Üí F in general
                                                               /k
position with respect to L can be extended to LœÑ (L) ÷í‚Üí F in such a way
that L, œÉ(L) and œÉœÑ (L) will be in general position, so gœÉ‚àí1 ¬∑ aœÉœÑ ¬∑ œÉœÑ h‚àí1
                                                                         œÑ  =
œÉhœÉ ¬∑ œÉgœÑ is an element of A(LœÉœÑ (L)) and simultaneously of A(œÉ(L)), i.e.,

hœÉ ¬∑ gœÑ ‚àà A(k) for any œÉ, œÑ : L ÷í‚Üí F in general position with respect to L.
This means that hœÉ = bœÉ ¬∑ f and gœÑ = f ‚àí1 ¬∑ cœÑ , where bœÉ , cœÑ ‚àà A(k) and
f ‚àà A(L), so aœÑ = f ‚àí1 ¬∑ cœÑ bœÑ ¬∑ œÑ f .
    For any Œæ ‚àà G there exist œÉ and œÑ in general position with respect to L
such that Œæ = œÉœÑ , and therefore, aŒæ = (f ‚àí1 ¬∑ cœÉ bœÉ ¬∑ œÉf ) ¬∑ œÉ(f ‚àí1 ¬∑ cœÑ bœÑ ¬∑ œÑ f ) =
f ‚àí1 ¬∑ (cœÉ bœÉ cœÑ bœÑ ) ¬∑ œÉœÑ f = f ‚àí1 ¬∑ dŒæ ¬∑ Œæf for some dŒæ ‚àà A(k), which means that
                                                                1
the 1-cocycle (aŒæ ) is cohomological to the image in HSm           (G, A(F )) of an

element of HSm (G, A(k)) = HomSm (G, A(k)), trivial by Theorem 2.9. ‚äì               ‚äî

     Remarks. 1. If n < ‚àû then there exist uncountably many semi-linear
smooth representations of G over F of any finite dimension. Namely, any
extension of coefficients from Q to F of a non-trivial finite-dimensional
smooth Q-representations of G gives such semi-linear representations of G.
(In fact, the natural map H 1 (G, A(k)) ‚àí‚Üí H 1 (G, A(F )) is injective for
any algebraic group A over k. Otherwise, for a pair of 1-cocycles (aœÉ ) and
(a‚Ä≤œÉ ) on G with values in A(k) there would exist such B ‚àà A(F ) that
œÉB = aœÉ ¬∑ B ¬∑ a‚Ä≤œÉ ‚àí1 . If f (B) 6‚àà k for some f ‚àà k(A) defined at B then there
is œÉ ‚àà G sending f (B) out of the field of definition of B, so œÉB 6= A ¬∑ B ¬∑ A‚Ä≤
for any A, A‚Ä≤ ‚àà A(k). ‚äì    ‚äî)

5.2 An example of H0 -calculation

Lemma 5.5. Let n = ‚àû, X a smooth projective variety over k, A an irre-
ducible commutative algebraic group over k, and either W = CH0 (XF )0Q , or
W = A(F )Q . Then for any open subgroup UL in G one has H0 (UL , W ) = 0.

Proof. Let K be the function field of X, or of A. The embeddings œÉ : K ÷í‚Üí F
over k, in general position with respect to L (i.e., with tr.deg(œÉ(K)L/L) =
tr.deg(K/k)), form a single UL -orbit. By Corollary 3.5, for any generic point
       /k
w : K ÷í‚Üí F in general position with respect to L the Q-space W is generated
by œÑ w ‚àí w for all œÑ ‚àà UL , so H0 (UL , W ) = 0. ‚äì

6 The category IG

Lemma 6.1. Let W be a Ssmooth representation of G, and L be an extension
of k in F . Then W UL = L0 ‚äÜL W UL0 , where L0 runs over extensions of k
of finite type.

Proof. For any w ‚àà W UL there is an extension L1 of k of finite type such
that w ‚àà W UL1 , so w ‚àà W H , where H = hUL , UL1 i.
   Consider first the case tr.deg(L/k) < ‚àû. Let L2 be generatedTover L1
by a transcendence basis of L over k. Then H ‚äá hUL , UL2 i and L2 L = L.
One has the following evident inclusions UL ‚äÜ hUL , UL2 i =: H ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ UL2 T L .
Consider the quotients H ‚Ä≤ /UL = hGal(L/L), UL2 /UL2 L i and UL2 T L /UL =
          T
Gal(L/L2 L).
                                                      T Chapter VIII, ¬ß1,
   By the standard Galois theory (e.g., S.Lang, Algebra,
Theorem 4), UL2 /UL2 L = Gal(L2 L/L2 ) ‚àº  = Gal(L/L2 L).
                                          T                            T
   According to Lemma 2.1, hGal(L/L2 L), Gal(L/L)i = Gal(L/L2 L),
so H ‚Ä≤ /UL = ULT2 T L /UL , and therefore, H ‚Ä≤ = UL2 T L . Finally, H ‚äá UL0 ,
where L0 = L2 L.
   Now consider the case tr.deg(L/k) = ‚àû. The group H contains the sub-
group hUL , UL1 i, which coincides, by Proposition 2.14, with UL T L1 . Let
                                                              T
L2 be generated over L1 by a transcendence basis S of L1 L over k (in
40                                                                                 M.Rovinsky


particular, L2 ‚äÇ L1 ). Then T  one has embeddings
                                        T           L1 ‚äÜ L2 ‚äÜ L1 ,TandTthere-
fore, L1 = L2 , and thus, L1 L = L2 L. Similarly, k(S) ‚äÜ L2 L L1 ‚äÜ
  T                        T T              T          T T
L L1 , and therefore, L2 (L L1 ) = L L1 = L2 (L L1 ). By Propo-
sition 2.14, this implies that hUL2 , UL T L1 i = UL2 T L T L1 , so H contains
                        T
UL3 , where L3 = L2 L. Let L4 be the minimal Gal(L/L)-invariant ex-
tension of L3 . As L3 is a subfield of L Tfinitely generated
                                                          T over k, L4 is an
extension of finite type of L3 . Then L4 L = L4 = L4 L, so by Proposi-
                                              T       Gal(L/L)
tion 2.14, hUL , UL4 i = UL0 , where L0 = L4 L = L4             .
    Finally, H ‚äá UL0 , where L0 is a subfield of L of finite type over k. ‚äì‚äî

Corollary 6.2. Let W be a smooth representation of G such that W UL1 =
W UL1 (t) for any extension L1 of k of finite type and any t ‚àà F ‚àí L1 . Then
W UL = W UL‚Ä≤ for any extension L of k and any purely transcendental ex-
tension L‚Ä≤ of L.
                                    S
Proof. By Lemma 6.1, W UL‚Ä≤ = L0 ‚äÜL‚Ä≤ W UL0 , where L0 runs over exten-
sions of k of finite type. Let L‚Ä≤ = L(x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . ) for some x1 , x2 , x3 , . . .
algebraically independent over L. Each L0 of this type is a subfield in
                                  ‚äÜ L of finite type
L1 (x1 , . . . , xN ) for some L1 S                    S over k and some inte-
ger N ‚â• 0. Then W UL‚Ä≤ = L0 ‚äÜL‚Ä≤ W UL0 ‚äÜ L1 ‚äÜL W UL1 = W UL , so
W UL‚Ä≤ = W UL . ‚äì       ‚äî

Lemma 6.3. Let F ‚Ä≤ $ F be an algebraically closed extension of k. Suppose
that W UF ‚Ä≤ = W UF ‚Ä≤ (x) for a smooth representation W of G and some x ‚àà
F ‚àí F ‚Ä≤ . Then W UL = W UL(x) for any extension L of k inside F ‚Ä≤ .

Proof. Fix a transcendence basis S of F ‚Ä≤ over L and set L1 = L(S).
   As the group UL1 is an extension of GF ‚Ä≤ /L1 by GF/F ‚Ä≤ , and UL1 (x) is an
extension of the group GF ‚Ä≤ (x)/L1 (x) = GF ‚Ä≤ /L1 by GF/F ‚Ä≤ (x) , one has
                            GF ‚Ä≤ /L1                    GF ‚Ä≤ (x)/L1 (x)
       W UL1 = W GF/F ‚Ä≤                 = W GF/F ‚Ä≤ (x)                      = W UL1 (x) .

   For any y ‚àà S ‚à™ {x} there is œÉ ‚àà UL inducing a permutation of S ‚à™ {x}
that transforms (S ‚à™ {x}) ‚àí {y} to S. Such œÉ induces an automorphism of
W UL1 (x) transforming W UL((S‚à™{x})‚àí{y}) to W UL1 , and therefore, the latter
two spaces coincide.
   This implies that W UL1 is fixed by the subgroup of G generated by
UL((S‚à™{x})‚àí{y}) for all y ‚àà S ‚à™ {x}. By Lemma 2.16, this subgroup is dense
in UL , and therefore, W UL1 = W UL . ‚äì ‚äî

    Let IG be the full subcategory in SmG consisting of those represen-
tations W of G for which W GF/L = W GF/L‚Ä≤ for any extension L of k in
F and any purely transcendental extension L‚Ä≤ of L in F . For each integer
             q
q ‚â• 0 let IG   be the full subcategory in IG consisting of those representa-
tions W of G for which W GF/F ‚Ä≤ = 0 for any algebraically closed F ‚Ä≤ with
tr.deg(F ‚Ä≤ /k) = q ‚àí 1.

Proposition 6.4. Any admissible representation of G is an object in IG if
n = ‚àû.
Proof. Let W be an admissible representation of G, L an extension of k in
F of finite type and x, y ‚àà F are algebraically independent over L. Then
the finite-dimensional space W UL is included into the finite-dimensional
spaces W UL(x) and W UL(y) ; and the latter ones are included into the finite-
dimensional space W UL(x,y) . As the group UL(x+y,xy) is an extension of the
group {1, Œ±} = Gal(L(x, y)/L(x + y, xy)) (so Œ±x = y and Œ±y = x) by
                                          hŒ±i
UL(x,y), one has W UL(x+y,xy) = W UL(x,y)      . As the subgroups UL(x+y,xy)
and UL(x,y) are conjugated in G, the spaces W UL(x+y,xy) and W UL(x,y) are
of the same dimension. This implies that W UL(x+y,xy) = W UL(x,y) , and thus,
Œ± acts trivially on W UL(x,y) .
    Notice, however, that Œ± permutes W UL(x) and W UL(y) , so W UL(x) =
   UL(y)
W        . By Lemma 2.16, the group generated by UL(x) and UL(y) is dense
in UL , and therefore, W UL = W UL(x) . ‚äì‚äî
Corollary 6.5. The category of admissible representations of G over E is
abelian. It is closed under extensions in SmG (E).
Proof. It suffices to check that for any short exact sequence
                          0 ‚àí‚Üí W1 ‚àí‚Üí W2 ‚àí‚Üí W3 ‚àí‚Üí 0
of representations of G with admissible W2 the representations W1 and W3
of G are also admissible. For any subextension L of finite type over k and a
transcendence basis t1 , t2 , t3 , . . . of F over L set L‚Ä≤ = L(t1 , t2 , t3 , . . . ). Then
                        U                 U          U
the sequence 0 ‚àí‚Üí W1 L‚Ä≤ ‚àí‚Üí W2 L‚Ä≤ ‚àí‚Üí W3 L‚Ä≤ ‚àí‚Üí 0 is exact. If n < ‚àû,
we can assume that F = L. As W2 ‚àà IG (E) in the case n = ‚àû, the middle
term coincides with W2UL , which is a finite-dimensional space, and therefore,
                    U                 U
so are the terms W1 L‚Ä≤ and W3 L‚Ä≤ , containing W1UL and W3UL , respectively.
This implies that W1 and W3 are admissible. ‚äì           ‚äî

   Remark. If n = ‚àû, the category of smooth representations of G has
such disadvantage that it has no non-zero projective objects.
   Proof. Let W be a projective object in the category of smooth E-
representations of G. Choose a system of generators {ej }j‚ààJ of W . This
determines a surjection
                           M              œÄ
                              E[G/ULj ] ‚àí‚Üí W,
                                j‚ààJ

where ULj ‚äÜ Stabej . Fix an element i0 ‚àà J and for each j ‚àà J fix
an extension L‚Ä≤j of Lj such that tr.deg(L‚Ä≤j /k) > tr.deg(L L i0 /k). As W is
projective, the composition of œÄ with the surjection           j‚ààJ E[G/UL‚Ä≤j ] ‚àí‚Üí

  j‚ààJ E[G/U   Lj ] splits, and therefore, there is an element in    j‚ààJ E[G/ULj ]
                                                                               ‚Ä≤

with the same stabilizer as ei0 . However, as E[G/UL‚Ä≤j ]             0   = 0, this implies
that ei0 = 0, and thus, W = 0. ‚äì   ‚äî

on IG for any purely transcendental extension L‚Ä≤ of L. The group GF/L‚Ä≤ is
compact, if F is algebraic over L‚Ä≤ , so H 0 (GF/L‚Ä≤ , ‚àí) is exact on SmG , and
thus, its restriction to IG is also exact.

Lemma 6.7. If F ‚Ä≤ is a subfield in F with tr.deg(F ‚Ä≤ /k) = ‚àû then the func-
tor H 0 (GF/F ‚Ä≤ , ‚àí) from SmG to SmGF ‚Ä≤ /k is an equivalence of categories (in-
ducing an equivalence of IG and IGF ‚Ä≤ /k ). The functor H 0 (GF/K , ‚àí) from
SmG to VectQ is exact if and only if tr.deg(K/k) = tr.deg(F/k)(‚â§ ‚àû).
                                                     ‚àº
Proof. There exists a field isomorphism œï : F ‚àí‚Üí F ‚Ä≤ identical on k. Then
                                                             ‚àº
œï induces an isomorphism of topological groups GF ‚Ä≤ /k ‚àí‚Üí G by œÑ 7‚àí‚Üí
œï‚àí1 œÑ œï and an equivalence of the categories of representations of G and
representations of GF ‚Ä≤ /k by œÄ 7‚àí‚Üí œï‚àó œÄ, where œï‚àó œÄ(œÑ ) = œÄ(œï‚àí1 œÑ œï).
    For any subfield L ‚äÇ F finitely generated over k there exists an element
œÉ ‚àà G such that œÉ|L = œï|L . Let W be a smooth representation of G. Then œï
                                            ‚àº
and œÉ induce the same isomorphism W UL ‚àí‚Üí W UœÉ(L) = W Uœï(L) . Passing to
                                                                 ‚àº     G
the direct limit with respect to L, we get an isomorphism W ‚àí‚Üí W F/F ‚Ä≤ .
For any œÑ ‚àà GF ‚Ä≤ /k and any w ‚àà W one has œïœÄ(œï‚àí1 œÑ œï)w = œÑ œïw (since œï

    Now, if tr.deg(K/k) = ‚àû, then H 0 (GF/K , ‚àí) is the composition of exact
functors H 0 (GF/K , ‚àí) and H 0 (Gal(K/K), ‚àí). Otherwise, if tr.deg(K/k) <
tr.deg(L/k), then the only GF/K -invariant element in Q[G/UL ] is zero, so
H 0 (GF/K , ‚àí) transforms the surjection Q[G/UL ] ‚àí‚Üí Q to 0 ‚àí‚Üí Q. ‚äì     ‚äî

Proof. Let W ‚Ä≤ ‚àà IG     . Any G-homomorphism W ‚àí‚Üí W ‚Ä≤ factors through
                                 q
Œ±(W ), which is an object in IG    , so we may assume that Œ± is surjective.
Let L be an extension of k in F and L‚Ä≤ a purely transcendental exten-
sion of L in F over which F is algebraic. As the functor H 0 (UL‚Ä≤ , ‚àí) is
exact on SmG , the morphism Œ± induces a surjection W UL‚Ä≤ ‚àí‚Üí (W ‚Ä≤ )UL‚Ä≤ . As
(W ‚Ä≤ )UL = (W ‚Ä≤ )UL‚Ä≤ , the subgroup UL acts trivially on (W ‚Ä≤ )UL‚Ä≤ , and there-
fore, the subrepresentation WL = hœÉw ‚àí w | œÉ ‚àà UL , w ‚àà W UL‚Ä≤ iG of G is
in the kernel of Œ± (it is independent of L‚Ä≤ as all possible L‚Ä≤ form a single
UL -orbit and œÉœÑ w ‚àí œÑ w = (œÉœÑ )w ‚àí w ‚àí (œÑ w ‚àí w) for any œÑ ‚àà UL and any
w ‚àà W UL‚Ä≤ ; moreover, WL dependsP     only on the G-orbit of L). This implies
that Œ± factors through IW := W/ L WL .
    The representation IW of G is smooth, so the map W UL‚Ä≤ ‚àí‚Üí (IW )UL‚Ä≤
induced by the projection is surjective, and therefore, one can lift any ele-
ment w ‚àà (IW )UL‚Ä≤ to an element w ‚àà W UL‚Ä≤ . Then œÉw‚àíw coincides with the
projection of œÉw ‚àí w for any œÉ ‚àà UL . Note, that œÉw ‚àí w ‚àà WL , so its projec-
tion is zero, and therefore, œÉw = w for any œÉ ‚àà UL . As (IW )UL ‚äÜ (IW )UL‚Ä≤ ,
this means that (IW )UL = (IW )UL‚Ä≤ , and thus, IW ‚àà IG .
    We may further suppose that W ‚àà IG . As Nq‚àí1 W ‚Ä≤ = 0 and Nq‚àí1 is
                                               Œ±
functorial, Nq‚àí1 W is in the kernel of W ‚àí‚Üí W ‚Ä≤ , so Œ± factors through
I q W := W/Nq‚àí1 W .
    As the functor H 0 (GF/F ‚Ä≤ , ‚àí) is exact on IG , one has a short exact
sequence

    Example. Let A be a one-dimensional group scheme over k, m ‚â• 1 an
integer, and W = Nq W be a smooth representation of G, where q ‚â§ n ‚àí 1.
Then I(S m A(F ) ‚äó W ) = 0 if either m is even, or if A = Ga , or if A = Gm .
                                                       VN
In particular, the natural projection A(F )‚äóNQ    ‚àí‚Üí       A(F )Q induces an
                       ‚äóN         V N
isomorphism I(A(F )Q ) ‚àí‚Üí I(          A(F )Q ) if n ‚â• N ‚àí 1.
    Proof. For any vector space V and its proper subspace V ‚Ä≤ the space
S m V is spanned by the elements x‚äóm for all x ‚àà V ‚àí V ‚Ä≤ , so S m A(F ) ‚äó
W is spanned by the elements x‚äóm ‚äó w for all w ‚àà W with Stabw ‚äá
Uk‚Ä≤ , tr.deg(k ‚Ä≤ /k) < q + 1, and all x ‚àà A(F ) ‚àí A(k ‚Ä≤ ). If m is even then
the stabilizer of such x‚äóm ‚äó w contains the group {œÉ ‚àà Uk‚Ä≤ | œÉx = ¬±x},
which contains the subgroup Uk‚Ä≤ (t) for an element t ‚àà k(x) := x(k(A)) with
quadratic extension k(x)/k(t). If A is rational then the stabilizer of x‚äóm ‚äów
contains the subgroup Uk‚Ä≤ (x) . This implies that the image of x‚äóm ‚äó w in
I(S m A(F ) ‚äó W ) spans a trivial subrepresentation of Uk‚Ä≤ . On the other
hand, as n ‚â• q + 1 > tr.deg(k ‚Ä≤ /k), there is œÉ ‚àà Uk‚Ä≤ such that œÉx = 2 ¬∑ x,
and thus, œÉ(x‚äóm ‚äó w) = 2m ¬∑ (x‚äóm ‚äó w), which means that this trivial
subrepresentation of Uk‚Ä≤ is zero, so I(S m A(F ) ‚äó W ) = 0. ‚äì  ‚äî

   Remark. I is not left exact, e.g., it transforms the injection k ÷í‚Üí F to
k ‚àí‚Üí 0.

Conjecture 6.9. If n = ‚àû then for any j ‚â• 0 and any object W of IG the
G-module grjN W is semi-simple.

This is evident when j = 0, and deduced easily from Corollary 6.22 when
j = 1.

Corollary 6.10. If n = ‚àû and Conjecture 6.9 holds for any 0 ‚â§ j ‚â§
q ‚àí 1 then the functor I q is exact on IG . This is equivalent to the strict
compatibility of the filtration N0 ‚äÜ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äÜ Nq‚àí1 with morphisms in IG .
                       Œ±        Œ≤
Proof. Let 0 ‚àí‚Üí W1 ‚àí‚Üí W2 ‚àí‚Üí W3 ‚àí‚Üí 0 be a short exact sequence in
IG . Then the first term of the induced exact sequence
             \
  0 ‚àí‚Üí (W1 Nq‚àí1 W2 )/Nq‚àí1 W1 ‚àí‚Üí I q W1 ‚àí‚Üí I q W2 ‚àí‚Üí I q W3 ‚àí‚Üí 0

measures deviation from the strict compatibility of Nq‚àí1 with the morphism
Œ±.
    To show that the filtration N‚Ä¢ on objects of IT  G is strictly compati-
ble with the morphisms, i.e., œï(Nj W1 ) = œï(W1 ) Nj W2 for any mor-
            œï
phism W1 ‚àí‚Üí W2 in IG , we proceed by induction on j ‚â• 0. This is
                                           G     ‚Ä≤
clear when j = 0. By Lemma 6.6, œï(W1 F/F ) = œï(W1 )GF/F ‚Ä≤ for any
          ‚Ä≤               ‚Ä≤
subfield F with tr.deg(F /k) = j, so œï(Nj W1 ) = Nj œï(W1 ), and thus,
Motives and representations of automorphism groups of Ô¨Åelds                    45


we may further suppose that œï is an embedding: WT1 ‚äÇ W2 . Suppose
       T                                      W   N W
that W1 Nj W2 6= Nj W1 . Replace W1 by W1‚Ä≤ := 1Nj Wj1 2 and W2 by
       Nj W2
W2‚Ä≤ := Nj W1 . Then 0 6=   W1‚Ä≤ ‚äÇ W2‚Ä≤ = Nj W2‚Ä≤ and Nj W1‚Ä≤ = 0. (By Proposition

6.8, W1‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ I j+1 W1 , so   by Lemma 6.6, W1‚Ä≤ ‚àà IG   , which is equivalent to
Nj W1‚Ä≤ = 0.)
   The induction assumption excludes the case W1‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ Nj‚àí1 W2‚Ä≤ , so we may
                       W‚Ä≤
replace W1‚Ä≤ by W1 := Nj‚àí11W ‚Ä≤ and W2‚Ä≤ by W2 := grjN W2‚Ä≤ . Then 0 =

   Assuming Conjecture 6.9, there is a morphism W2 ‚àí‚Üí W1 splitting the

    Remark. The inclusion Q[G/UL ]‚ó¶ ÷í‚Üí Q[G/UL ] is an example of mor-

sufficiently many projective objects in IG for any s ‚â• 0.
                                                       s
Proof. Any exact sequence 0 ‚àí‚Üí W1 ‚àí‚Üí W2 ‚àí‚Üí W3 ‚àí‚Üí 0 in IG gives

Lemma 6.12. For any 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ ‚àû, any subfield L1 ‚äÇ F of finite type over

                                                 Œ±
Proof. Let x ‚àà F ‚àí L1 and let Q[G/UL1 (x) ] ‚àí‚Üí IQ[G/UL1 (x) ] = CL1 (x) be

[UL1 (x) ] ‚àà WL1 ‚äÇ Q[G/UL1 (x) ] (see definition of I in the proof of Propo-

    One has L1 ‚äÜ L2 ‚äÜ L1 (x1 , . . . , xN ) for some x1 , . . . , xN algebraically

Proof. Let t1 , . . . , tN be a transcendence basis of F ‚Ä≤ over F ‚Ä≤ L, and thus,
a transcendence basis of F ‚Ä≤ L over L. Then the surjections

Proposition 6.15. IG (E) is a Serre subcategory in SmG (E) if n = ‚àû.
Proof. By Lemma 6.6, the category IG (E) is closed under taking subquo-
tients in SmG (E), so we have only to check that it is closed under extensions
in SmG (E).
    Let 0 ‚àí‚Üí W1 ‚àí‚Üí W ‚àí‚Üí W2 ‚àí‚Üí 0 be an extension in SmG (E) with
W1 , W2 ‚àà IG (E). By Corollary 6.2 and Lemma 6.3, it suffices to check that
W UL = W UL‚Ä≤ for any extension L of k in F of finite type and a purely
transcendental extension L‚Ä≤ of L with L‚Ä≤ = F . As the functor H 0 (UL‚Ä≤ , ‚àí) =
HomSmU ‚Ä≤ (E) (E, ‚àí) is exact on SmG (E) and W1 , W2 ‚àà IG (E), this is equiv-
         L
alent to the vanishing of Ext1SmU (E) (E, ‚àí) on IG (E). As the forgetful func-
                                     L
tor SmG (E) ‚àí‚Üí SmUL (E) induces IG (E) ‚àí‚Üí IUL (E), one can replace k
with L and then it remains to show the vanishing of Ext1SmG (E) (E, ‚àí) on
IG (E).
    Let 0 ‚àí‚Üí W1 ‚àí‚Üí W ‚àí‚Üí E ‚àí‚Üí 0 be an extension in SmG (E) with
W1 ‚àà IG (E). Choose some e ‚àà W projecting to 1 ‚àà E. The stabilizer
of e contains an open subgroup UL . Fix a maximal purely transcendental
extension L‚Ä≤ P of k in L. Let L‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ be a Galois extension of L‚Ä≤ containing L.
          1
Then [L‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ :L‚Ä≤ ] œÉ‚ààGal(L‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ /L‚Ä≤ ) œÉe is fixed by UL‚Ä≤ and projects to 1 ‚àà E, so W
is a sum of W1 and a quotient of E[G/UL‚Ä≤ ]. Restriction to E[G/UL‚Ä≤ ]‚ó¶ of
the projection E[G/UL‚Ä≤ ] ‚àí‚Üí W factors through W1 which is an object in
IG (E).
    Let œÉ ‚àà G be such an element that L‚Ä≤ and œÉ(L‚Ä≤ ) are in general position
and œÉ 2 |L‚Ä≤ = id. Then [1] ‚àí [œÉ] is a generator of E[G/UL‚Ä≤ ]‚ó¶ , so there is
a surjection E[G/UL‚Ä≤ œÉ(L‚Ä≤ ) ] ‚àí‚Üí E[G/UL‚Ä≤ ]‚ó¶ sending [œÑ ] to [œÑ ] ‚àí [œÑ œÉ], and
therefore, a surjection E = CL‚Ä≤ œÉ(L‚Ä≤ ) ‚äó E ‚àí‚Üí IE[G/UL‚Ä≤ ]‚ó¶ . However, œÉ
changes sign of the generator [1]‚àí[œÉ] of E[G/UL‚Ä≤ ]‚ó¶ , and thus, IE[G/UL‚Ä≤ ]‚ó¶ =
0. This means that the projection E[G/UL‚Ä≤ ] ‚àí‚Üí W factors through E, i.e.,
W ‚àº = W1 ‚äï E. ‚äì   ‚äî

Conjecture 6.16. If n = ‚àû then CH0 (XF )Q = Ck(X) for any smooth irre-
ducible proper variety X over k.

Remark. This is true, by Corollary 6.21 and Lemma 6.12, if k(X) is uni-
rational over a one-dimensional field. Another example is given by k(X) =
                        2     m          Pm
k(x1 , . . . , xm )he1 e2 ¬∑¬∑¬∑em i , where j=1 xdj = 1, m is odd and d ‚àà {m+1, m+2},
ei xj = Œ∂ Œ¥ij ¬∑ xj for a primitive dth root of unity Œ∂. (The proof is the same
as for CH0 (X) = Z.)

Proposition 6.17. If n = ‚àû then for any irreducible variety X over k
                              /k
the kernel of Q[{k(X) ÷í‚Üí F }] ‚àí‚Üí Ck(X) is the sum over all curves y ‚àà
(k(X) ‚äók F )1 of subspaces spanned by those linear combinations of generic
(with respect to a field of definition of y) F -points of {y} that are linearly
equivalent to zero on any compactification of {y}.

Proof. Let H be the set of algebraically closed extensions F‚àû of k in F such
that tr.deg(F/F‚àû ) = 1. Set hK := hUK . By Lemma 6.3 and Corollary 6.2,
the kernel ‚àû W of W ‚àí‚Üí IW coincides with
    X
        hœÉw ‚àí w | w ‚àà W GF/F‚àû (t) , œÉ ‚àà GF/F‚àû , t ‚àà F ‚àí F‚àû iQ

           F‚àû ‚ààH

   If W = Q[G/UL ] this is the same as
      X                                    /k
             hœÉhF‚àû (t) Œæ ‚àí hF‚àû (t) Œæ | Œæ : L ÷í‚Üí F, œÉ ‚àà GF/F‚àû , t ‚àà F ‚àí F‚àû iQ .
     F‚àû ‚ààH

We may suppose that in this sum Œæ(L) 6‚äÇ F‚àû , as otherwise œÉhF‚àû (t) Œæ ‚àí
hF‚àû (t) Œæ = 0. Then the pair (Œæ, F‚àû ) determines the F‚àû -curve C F‚àû ,Œæ :=
Spec((Œæ ¬∑ id)(L ‚äók F‚àû )) on Spec(L ‚äók F‚àû ).
   As for any pair of elements œÉ ‚àà GF/F‚àû and Œ± ‚àà GF/F‚àû (t) the homomor-
                     œÉŒ±Œæ¬∑id                                       Œæ¬∑id
phism L ‚äók F‚àû ‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚Üí F is the composition of L ‚äók F‚àû ‚àí‚Üí F with the
automorphism œÉŒ±, the kernels of œÉŒ±Œæ ¬∑ id and of Œæ ¬∑ id coincide, and thus,
œÉhF‚àû (t) Œæ ‚àí hF‚àû (t) Œæ is an F -divisor on C F‚àû ,Œæ , which is a linear combination
of generic F -points of C F‚àû ,Œæ .
    The triplet (Œæ, F‚àû , t) determines the F‚àû -curve CtF‚àû ,Œæ := Spec((Œæ ¬∑
                                                              T          Œ≤

induced by the inclusions F‚àû [t] ‚äÇ (Œæ ¬∑ id)(L ‚äók F‚àû [t]) ‚äÉ (Œæ ¬∑ id)(L ‚äók F‚àû ).
Now one can rewrite œÉhF‚àû (t) Œæ ‚àí hF‚àû (t) Œæ as Œ≤‚àó T ‚àó div( TT‚àíœÉt
                                                            ‚àít ), which is the
divisor of a rational function on any compactification of C F‚àû ,Œæ √óF‚àû F =

Spec((L ‚äók F )/p) =: Cp , where p := ker(L ‚äók F ‚àí‚Üí F ‚äóF‚àû F ).

6.2 Objects of IG of level 1

For a subfield L in F of finite type over k denote by Z0rat (L ‚äók F ) the kernel
of the natural projection Q[G/UL ] ‚àí‚Üí CH0 (XF )Q for a smooth proper
model X of L over k.                               L
    For any W ‚àà SmG one has a surjection                 G

where F ‚Ä≤ is an algebraically closed extension of k in F with tr.deg(F ‚Ä≤ /k) = 1.
This means that to describe the objects of IG of level 1 it suffices to treat the
case W = heiG , where Stabe ‚äá UL with L ‚àº     = k(X) for a smooth projective
curve X over k of genus g ‚â• 0. Then W is dominated by CL . Let JX be the

the class of j=1 Œ≥j + j=1 Œ±j in Pics+g X is a generic point. Then there is

thus, suppose that Œ¥1 , . . . , Œ¥s are in general position.
    Fix a collection Œ∫ij of generic points of X in general position, also with

that the classes of Œ≥1 + i=1 Œ∫i1 , . . . , Œ≥s + i=1 Œ∫is in Picg+1 X are generic

suppose that both Œ≥1 , . . . , Œ≥s and Œ¥1 , . . . , Œ¥s are in general position.
                                                                                        /k

Lemma 6.19. The images of the generators wN = j=1 œÉj ‚àí j=1 œÑj of
Z0rat (L ‚äók F ) (from Lemma 6.18) in W := IZ0rat (L ‚äók F ) are fixed by G.
Proof. Set M := N + g. Then for any generic point Œ≥ of PicM (XF ) in
general position with respect to œÉ1 , . . . , œÉN , œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN there is a collection
Œ±1 , . . . , Œ±g of generic points of XF , also in general position with respect to
                                                            PN              Pg
œÉ1 , . . . , œÉN , œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN , such that the class of j=1 œÉj + j=1 Œ±j coincides
with Œ≥.
     There exists an M -tuple Œæ = (Œæ1 , . . . , ŒæM ) of generic points such that
both 2M -tuples (œÉ1 , . . . , œÉN , Œ±1 , . . . , Œ±g ; Œæ) and (œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN , Œ±1 , . . . , Œ±g ; Œæ) are
                                                       ‚àí1
generic points of the irreducible variety pM              (0).
     The subfields
 LŒæ := (Œæ1 (L) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ŒæM (L))SM ,          LœÉ := (œÉ1 (L) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ œÉN (L)Œ±1 (L) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Œ±g (L))SM
are isomorphic to the function field of the M th symmetric power of X, and
                                                                    ‚àí1
LœÉ LŒæ is isomorphic to the function field of the SM \pM                (0)/SM . As M th
symmetric power of X is birational to the product of the Jacobian of X
and a projective space, the subfields LŒæ , LœÉ , as well as LœÉ LŒæ , are purely
transcendental extensions of the subfield Œ≥(k(PicM (X))) in F . Clearly, the
same is true for the subfields LœÑ := (œÑ1 (L) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ œÑN (L)Œ±1 (L) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Œ±g (L))SM and
LœÑ LŒæ .

   j=1 Œ±j ‚àí   j=1 Œæj of Z0 (L‚äók F ) are fixed by ULœÉ LŒæ and by ULœÑ LŒæ , respec-
tively. Then the classes of wœÉ and of wœÑ in W are fixed by UŒ≥(k(PicM (X))) ,
and thus, so is their difference wN .
    Fix a purely transcendental extension L0 of k in F with tr.deg(L0 /k) = g
in general position with respect to œÉ1 , . . . , œÉN , œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN . Then
                                 \
                 L0 =                            Œ≥(k(PicM (X))),
                             Œ≥‚ààG, Œ≥(k(PicM (X)))‚äÉL0

so by Lemma 2.1, the subgroup in G generated by UŒ≥(k(PicM (X))) for such
Œ≥ contains UL0 , and thus, the image of wN in W is fixed by UL0 .
   Finally, as W ‚àà IG , one has wN ‚àà W UL0 = W G . ‚äì  ‚äî

fixed by G. As (œÉ1 , . . . , œÉN ; œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN ) and (œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN ; œÉ1 , . . . , œÉN ) are both
generic points of the irreducible variety p‚àí1          N (0) and the generic points form
a single G-orbit, there is an element Œ≤ ‚àà G such that Œ≤œÉj = œÑj and Œ≤œÑj = œÉj
for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ N , so Œ≤w = ‚àíw. As W is generated by the images of wN ‚Äôs,
which are fixed by G, we get W = 0. ‚äì                ‚äî

Corollary 6.21. Let X be a smooth projective curve over k, L = k(X)
be its function field and Q[G/UL ]‚ó¶ be the group of degree-zero 0-cycles. If
n = ‚àû then IQ[G/UL ]‚ó¶ = Pic‚ó¶ (XF )Q and CL = Pic(XF )Q .
Proof. Using Proposition 6.20, this can be done by applying the right-
exact functor I to the short exact sequences 0 ‚àí‚Üí Z0rat (L ‚äók F ) ‚àí‚Üí

Corollary 6.22. If n = ‚àû then any object of IG of level 1 is a direct sum
of a trivial module and a quotient of direct sum of modules A(F )Q for some
abelian varieties A over k by a trivial submodule.
Proof. By Corollary 6.21, any object W of IG of level 1 is a quotient of
L
   X‚ààI Pic(XF )Q for a set I of smooth projective curves over k. As there
is a splitting
       L       Pic(XF )Q ‚àº
                         = Q ‚äï Pic‚ó¶ (XF )Q , we get that W is a quotient of
   G
W ‚äï A‚ààJ A(F )Q for a set J of simple abelian varieties over k.
                         G
    In particular, W/W
                    L      is semi-simple, so there is a subset J ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ J such
                                           G
that the projection

    Then W ‚äï A‚ààJ ‚Ä≤ A(F )Q ‚àí‚Üí W is a surjection with trivial kernel. ‚äì      ‚äî
Corollary 6.23. If n = ‚àû then A(F )Q (resp., WA ) is a projective object
                  1
of IG (resp., of IG ) for any abelian k-variety A.
Proof. A(F )Q (resp., WA ) is a direct summand of Pic(XF )Q (resp., WJX )
for a smooth curve X on A, which is a projective object in IG (resp., in
  1
IG  ) by Corollary 6.21 and Corollary 6.11. ‚äì

T Define the following decreasing filtration on the objects of IG : F W =

Proof. By Corollary 6.22, F 1 W = ker(W ‚àí‚Üí Q ‚äï W ‚Ä≤ ), where W ‚Ä≤ runs
over all quotients of direct sum of modules A(F )Q for some abelian varieties
A over k by a trivial submodule. We may suppose that œï‚Äôs are surjective.
As Ck(X) is projective, any such œï lifts to a homomorphism to the direct
sum of A(F )Q .
                              deg            ‚àº Q ‚äï C ‚ó¶ . One has
   Let C ‚ó¶ k(X)= ker(Ck(X) ‚àí‚Üí Q), so Ck(X) =           k(X)

            ‚ó¶
     HomG (Ck(X) , A(F )Q ) = HomG (Ck(X) , A(F )Q )/HomG (Q, A(F )Q )
                  = (A(k(X))/A(k))Q = (Mor(X, A)/A(k))Q
                          = Hom(AlbX, A)Q = HomG (AlbX(F )Q , A(F )Q ),

                                    ‚ó¶
so any G-homomorphisms from Ck(X)      to any object of level 1 factors through

    The filtration splits, since AlbX(F )Q is projective. ‚äì‚äî

duces a surjection of UL -modules Q[{L(X) ÷í‚Üí F }] ‚àí‚Üí Ck(X) for any ex-
tension L of k in F with tr.deg(F/L) = ‚àû and any irreducible k-variety
X.
                            /k
Proof. For any œÉ : k(X) ÷í‚Üí F there is a generic curve Y on XF defined over
some k ‚Ä≤ such that œÉ is its F -point generic with respect to k ‚Ä≤ . Then the class
                      /k‚Ä≤
of œÉ in Ik‚Ä≤ Q[{k ‚Ä≤ (Y ) ÷í‚Üí F }] can be presented by a linear combination of F -
points of Y generic with respect to k ‚Ä≤ L. As generic points of Y are generic
                                          /L
points of X, this means that Q[{L(X) ÷í‚Üí F }] ‚àí‚Üí Ck(X) is surjective. ‚äì
                                                                     ‚äî

   Propositions 6.15 and the following one suggest that the category IG
should be related to the category of effective homological motives.
Proposition 6.26. The inner Hom functor13 on SmG induces the inner
Hom functor on IG if n = ‚àû. Level of Hom(W1 , W2 ) does not exceed q if
W1 , W2 = Nq W2 ‚àà IG and q ‚â§ 1.
Proof. For any W1 ‚àà ILG there is a collection I of irreducible varieties over
k and a surjection of   X‚ààI Ck(X) onto W1 , and thus, an inclusion of G-
modules                             Y
                 Hom(W1 , W2 ) ÷í‚Üí       Hom(Ck(X) , W2 ).
                                      X‚ààI

Clearly,
  Q      for any collection {MŒ± }Œ±‚ààI of objects of IG any smooth submodule
in Œ±‚ààI MŒ± is also an object of IG , and thus, to show that Hom(W1 , W2 ) ‚àà
IG for any W1 , W2 ‚àà IG it suffices to check that Hom(W1 , W2 ) ‚àà IG for
any W2 ‚àà IG and any W1 of type Ck(X) .
   By its definition, Hom(W1 , W2 ) is the union of HomUL (W1 , W2 ) over all
open subgroups UL in G.
   Fix an algebraically closed subfield F ‚Ä≤ of F such that tr.deg(F/F ‚Ä≤ ) =
                                                     /k
tr.deg(F ‚Ä≤ /k) = ‚àû and an embedding œÉ : k(X) ÷í‚Üí F in general position
with respect to F ‚Ä≤ .
    As, by Corollary 6.25, for any L ‚äÇ F ‚Ä≤ with tr.deg(F/L) = ‚àû there
                                                     /L
is a surjection of UL -modules W := Q[{L(X) ÷í‚Üí F }] ‚àí‚Üí W1 , one has
13
     (W1 , W2 ) 7‚àí‚Üí lim HomU (W1 , W2 ), where U runs over the set of open sub-
                   U‚Üí
groups of G. Clearly, HomG (W1 , Hom(W2 , W3 )) = HomG (W1 ‚äó W2 , W3 ) for any

functor SmG ‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚Üí SmGF ‚Ä≤ /k is an equivalence of categories, inducing
an equivalence of IG and IGF ‚Ä≤ /k , so the object Hom(W1 , W2 ) belongs to
IG .
     If W2 is a trivial G-module then Hom(Ck(X) , W2 ) = W2 , so the repre-
sentation Hom(W1 , W2 ) is a submodule of a trivial G-module, and thus,
Hom(W1 , W2 ) is trivial itself.
     To show that Hom(W  L1 , W2 )‚ó¶is of level 1, if W
                                                     L2 = N1 W1 , it is sufficient
to treat the case W1 = X‚ààI Ck(X)        and W2 = ( j‚ààJ Aj (F )Q )/Œõ for some
       L
Œõ ‚äÜ j‚ààJ Aj (k)Q . Then, using Corollaries 6.24 and 6.25, we get that

                                 /L
         HomUL (Q[{L(X) ÷í‚Üí F }]‚ó¶ , W2 ) = HomUL (AlbX(F )Q , W2 ).

As this is independent of L, the G-module Hom(W1 , W2 ) is trivial. ‚äì
                                                                    ‚äî

   Remark. The G-equivariant pairing Q[G/U ] ‚äó Q[G/U ] ‚àí‚Üí Q given
by [œÉ] ‚äó [œÑ ] 7‚àí‚Üí 0 if [œÉ] 6= [œÑ ] and [œÉ] ‚äó [œÉ] 7‚àí‚Üí 1 defines an embedding
of Q[G/U ] into its contragredient, so, unlike the objects of IG in the case
n = ‚àû, for any 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ ‚àû there exist many smooth G-modules with
non-trivial contragredients.


6.4 A tensor structure on IG

As Example after Proposition 6.8 on p.44 shows, IG is not closed under
tensor products in SmG . We define W1 ‚äóI W2 by I(W1 ‚äó W2 ).
   This operation is not associative on SmG as one can see from the fol-
lowing example. Let Wj = Q[G/Uj ] for some open subgroups Uj = ULj in
                                                         QN
G, 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ N , N ‚â• 2. Then one has W1 ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó WN = Q[ j=1 G/Uj ] =
L

         Q
  œÑ ‚ààG\(  j
   Clearly, the representation Q[G ¬∑ (œÑ1 , œÑ2 , . . . , œÑN )] is isomorphic to the
                     TN
representation Q[G/( j=1 œÑj Uj œÑj‚àí1 )], so
                                             M
         I(W1 ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó WN ) ‚àº
                             =                                     CL1 œÑ2 (L2 )...œÑN (LN ) .14
                                                  Q
                                      (œÑj )‚ààG\(       j   G/Uj )

                                               L                        /k

   More symmetrically, W1 ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó WN ‚àº

If U1 = U2 = Uk(x) , one has IW1 = IW2 = Q, and therefore, W1 ‚äóI (W2 ‚äóI
Q) = W1 ‚äóI IW2 = IW1 = Q.
    On the other hand, by Noether normalization, (W1 ‚äóI W2 ) ‚äóI Q =
I(W1 ‚äó W2 ) contains submodules isomorphic to CL for any field L finitely
generated over k and with tr.deg(L/k) = 1.

Lemma 6.27. If n = ‚àû then for any finite collection of smooth irreducible
proper k-varieties X1 , . . . , XN there is a canonical surjection of G-modules
                    I(Œ±)                          
Ck(X1 √ók ¬∑¬∑¬∑√ók XN ) ‚àí‚Üí I Ck(X1 ) ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó Ck(XN ) .
   If Ck(X1 √ók ¬∑¬∑¬∑√ók XN ) = CH0 (X1 √ók ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ók XN )Q then I(Œ±) is an isomor-
phism.

Proof. It suffices to check that the canonical G-homomorphism Q[{k(X1 )‚äók

¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äók k(XN ) ÷í‚Üí F }] ‚àí‚Üí Ck(X1 ) ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó Ck(XN ) , given by œÑ ‚àí

¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó œÑ |k(XN ) , is surjective, and its kernel is contained in the kernel of

Q[{k(X1 ) ‚äók ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äók k(XN ) ÷í‚Üí F }] ‚àí‚Üí Ck(X1 √ók ¬∑¬∑¬∑√ók XN ) (so that a canonical
G-homomorphism Ck(X1 ) ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó Ck(XN ) ‚àí‚Üí Ck(X1 √ók ¬∑¬∑¬∑√ók XN ) is defined,
and the composition

                        I(Œ±)                          
    Ck(X1 √ók ¬∑¬∑¬∑√ók XN ) ‚àí‚Üí I Ck(X1 ) ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó Ck(XN ) ‚àí‚Üí Ck(X1 √ók ¬∑¬∑¬∑√ók XN )

is the identity).
     We have to check that for any collection of generic points œÉj ‚àà Xj ,
1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ N , the class œÉ of œÉ1 ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó œÉN in Ck(X1 ) ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó Ck(XN ) is a linear
combination of the images of generic points of X1 √ók ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ók XN .
     By induction on j we show that œÉ is a linear combination of elements of
type œÉ1‚Ä≤ ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó œÉN
                    ‚Ä≤
                      , where œÉ1‚Ä≤ , . . . , œÉj‚Ä≤ are in general position. For j = 1 there
is nothing to prove. If j > 1 there is a curve Y on Xj defined over a subfield
k ‚Ä≤ ‚äÇ F with tr.deg(k ‚Ä≤ /k) < ‚àû such that œÉj‚Ä≤ ‚àà Y (F )‚àí Y (k ‚Ä≤ ). Clearly, for any
G-module W the canonical G-homomorphism W ‚àí‚Üí IW factors through
the GF/k‚Ä≤ -homomorphism W ‚àí‚Üí Ik‚Ä≤ W . Here Ik‚Ä≤ : SmGF/k‚Ä≤ ‚àí‚Üí IGF/k‚Ä≤
denotes the same functor as I, but in the context of GF/k‚Ä≤ -modules. The
embedding Y ÷í‚Üí (Xj )k‚Ä≤ induces the GF/k‚Ä≤ -homomorphism Q[Y (F )] ‚àí‚Üí
Q[Xj (F )], and therefore, using Corollary 6.21, the GF/k‚Ä≤ -homomorphism
                                                    M

                                                 x‚àà(Xj )k‚Ä≤

                                                                         L
This implies that the image of œÉj‚Ä≤ ‚àà Y (F ) in IQ[Xj (F )] = x‚ààXj Ck(x) ,
which is equal to [œÉj‚Ä≤ ] ‚àà Ck(Xj ) , coincides with the image of a linear com-
bination of some generic points of Y that are in general position with re-
spect to œÉ1‚Ä≤ , . . . , œÉj‚àí1
                          ‚Ä≤
                             , i.e., of some points of Y (F ) ‚àí Y (k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ), where k ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ =

                        ‚Ä≤   (k(Xj‚àí1 )). This completes the induction, so we may
suppose that œÉ1 , . . . , œÉj are in general position. Then there is some œÑ :

k(X1 ) ‚äók ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äók k(XN ) ÷í‚Üí F such that œÑ |k(Xj ) = œÉj for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ N , thus
implying that Œ± is surjective.
    Besides, the representation Ck(X1 ) ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó Ck(XN ) surjects onto the rep-
resentation CH0 ((X1 )F ) ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó CH0 ((XN )F )Q , and the latter one surjects
onto CH0 ((X1 √ók ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ók XN )F )Q = Ck(X1 √ók ¬∑¬∑¬∑√ók XN ) . ‚äì‚äî

Corollary 6.28. If n = ‚àû and Lemma 6.27 is true then ‚äóI is associative,
the class of projective objects in IG is stable under ‚äóI , and W1 ‚äóI ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äóI
WN = I (W1 ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó WN ).

Proof. By Lemma 6.27, the class of G-modules of type CL is stable under ‚äóI ,
and ‚äóI is associative on this class. As any projective object is a direct sum-
mand of a direct sum of G-modules of type CL , the same holds for the class
of projective objects in IG , and also W1 ‚äóI ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äóI WN = I (W1 ‚äó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äó WN )
for projective W1 , . . . , WN .
                                                         Œ±j
    Any object Wj ‚àà IG is the cokernel of a map Qj ‚àí‚Üí Pj , where Pj and
Qj are direct sums of G-modules of type CL . This implies that Wi ‚äóI Wj is
                                           id‚äóŒ±j +Œ±i ‚äóid
the cokernel of Pi ‚äóI Qj ‚äï Qi ‚äóI Pj ‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚Üí Pi ‚äóI Pj , and in general,
(. . . (W1 ‚äóI W2 ) ‚äóI ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ) ‚äóI WN is the cokernel of

     N                                   P

Clearly, this is independent of rearrangements of the brackets. ‚äì
                                                                ‚äî

     Remarks. 1. As it follows from Example on p.44, The form W1 ‚äóW2 ‚àí‚Üí
W1 ‚äóI W2 can be degenerate. (If W1 = E(F )Q for an elliptic curve E over
k, and W2 = W1 /Œõ for some subspace 0 6= Œõ ‚äÜ E(k)Q then W1 ‚äóI W1 =
   V2
I( W1 ) surjects onto W1 ‚äóI W2 with kernel dominated by W1 ‚äó Œõ. As
the form is skew-symmetric, when lifted to W1 ‚äó W1 , its left kernel contains
Œõ. ‚äì  ‚äî)
     2. The functor E(F )‚äóI is not exact. (Applying it to Œõ ÷í‚Üí W1 , we get
                               V2
W1 ‚äó Œõ ‚àí‚Üí I(W1‚äó2 ) = I( W1 ), with the kernel containing S 2 Œõ, since
                                                                    V
S 2 Œõ is in the kernel of the composition W1 ‚äó Œõ ÷í‚Üí W1‚äó2 ‚àí‚Üí 2 W1 . )
     In particular, if we denote by TorI‚Ä¢ (W, ‚àí) the left derivatives of the
functor W ‚äóI then TorI‚Ä¢ (W1 , W2 ) 6‚àº   = TorI‚Ä¢ (W2 , W1 ). (As the functor W ‚äóI
is right exact, any projective object of IG is acyclic, cf., e.g., [GM], Ch.III,
¬ß6.12., so if TorI‚Ä¢ (W1 , W2 ) ‚àº
                               = TorI‚Ä¢ (W2 , W1 ) then

                     TorIj (E(F )Q , W ) ‚àº
                                         = TorIj (W, E(F )Q ) = 0

if j > 0, i.e., the functor E(F )‚äóI should be exact. ‚äì

7 Representations induced from the compact open subgroups

In this section we give an example (Corollary 7.3) of a pair of essentially
different open compact subgroups U and U ‚Ä≤ in G with embeddings of E-
representations E[G/U ] ÷í‚Üí E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] and E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] ÷í‚Üí E[G/U ] of G. This
implies that E[G/U ] and E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] have the same irreducible subquotients.
Proposition 7.4 contains one more example of this phenomenon. However,
it seems crucial for these examples that the primitive motives of maximal
                              ‚Ä≤
level of models of F U and F U coincide (and trivial).
    But first, two general remarks.
    Remarks. 1. Representation of G/G‚ó¶ . Let U be a compact open
subgroup in G. Then there is a surjection of the E-representation E[G/U ]
of G onto any irreducible E-representation of G factorizing through the
quotient G/G‚ó¶ .
    2. Twists by 1-dimensional representations. Let œï be a homomor-
phism from G/G‚ó¶ to Q√ó . We consider E[G/U ](œï) as the same E-vector
                                              œÑ
space as E[G/U ], but with the G-action [œÉ] 7‚àí‚Üí œï(œÑ ) ¬∑ [œÑ œÉ]. Then Œªœï ([œÉ]) :=
                                                                   Œªœï
œï(œÉ)¬∑[œÉ] defines an isomorphism of representations E[G/U ] ‚àí‚Üí E[G/U ](œï)
of G.
    This implies that for any irreducible E-representation W of G the mul-
tiplicities of W and W (œï) in E[G/U ] coincide.


7.1 Purely transcendental extensions of quadratic extensions

Lemma
   T        7.1. Let U and U ‚Ä≤ be openT compact
                                          S      Tsubgroups in T G such that
U U ‚Ä≤ is of index 2 in U : U = (U U ‚Ä≤ ) œÉ(U U ‚Ä≤ ), and U ‚Ä≤ œÉU ‚Ä≤ œÉ ‚äÜ U .
Then U is the only right U -coset in U U ‚Ä≤ . Equivalently, for any œÉ1 , œÉ2 ‚àà G
if œÉ1 U U ‚Ä≤ = œÉ2 U U ‚Ä≤ then œÉ1 U = œÉ2 U .

Proof. Equivalence. If U is the only right U -coset in U U ‚Ä≤ and œÉ1 U U ‚Ä≤ =
œÉ2 U U ‚Ä≤ then œÉ2‚àí1 œÉ1 U ‚äÜ U U ‚Ä≤ , so œÉ2‚àí1 œÉ1 U = U , i.e., œÉ2‚àí1 œÉ1 ‚àà U . Conversely,
suppose that œÉ1 U U ‚Ä≤ = œÉ2 U U ‚Ä≤ implies œÉ1 U = œÉ2 U . Then if œÉ1 U ‚äÜ U U ‚Ä≤ one
also has œÉ1 U U ‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ U U ‚Ä≤ and, by the measure argument, œÉ1 U U ‚Ä≤ = U U ‚Ä≤ , and
thus, œÉ1 U = U .                                              S
    Now suppose that œÉ1 U U ‚Ä≤ = œÉ2 U U ‚Ä≤ . As U U ‚Ä≤ = U ‚Ä≤ œÉU ‚Ä≤ , one has either
œÉ1 U ‚Ä≤ = œÉ2 U ‚Ä≤ and œÉ1 œÉU ‚Ä≤ = œÉ2 œÉU ‚Ä≤ , or œÉ1 U ‚Ä≤ = œÉ2 œÉU ‚Ä≤ and œÉ1 œÉU ‚Ä≤ = œÉ2 U ‚Ä≤ .
The second case can be reduced to the first one by replacing      T     œÉ2 with œÉ2 œÉ
(as this does not change œÉ2 U ). Now one has œÉ1‚àí1 œÉ2 ‚àà U ‚Ä≤ œÉU ‚Ä≤ œÉ ‚äÜ U , and
thus, œÉ1 U = œÉ2 U . ‚äì  ‚äî                T             T              T
    Remark. One obviously has U U ‚Ä≤ = œÉ(UT U ‚Ä≤ )œÉ ‚äÜ U ‚Ä≤ T (œÉU ‚Ä≤ œÉ). Un-
der assumptions of Lemma 7.1, this means U ‚Ä≤ (œÉU ‚Ä≤ œÉ) = U U ‚Ä≤ .
                           ‚Ä≤
Lemma
  T ‚Ä≤ 7.2. Let U and U be some     TopenScompact     T subgroups in G such that
U U is of index 2 in U : U = (U U ‚Ä≤ ) œÉ(U U ‚Ä≤ ). Suppose that for any
integer N ‚â• 1 and any collection œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN ‚àà U ‚Ä≤ œÉ‚àíU one has œÑ1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ œÑN 6= 1.

Then the morphism of E-representations E[G/U ] ‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚Üí E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] of G
is injective.
                                          T                            T
Proof. First,
            T   we check that U ‚Ä≤ (œÉU ‚Ä≤ œÉ) ‚äÜ U . If œÑ ‚àà U ‚Ä≤ (œÉU ‚Ä≤ œÉ) ‚àí U then
œÑ ‚àí1 ‚àà U ‚Ä≤ (œÉU ‚Ä≤ œÉ) ‚àí U , so 1 = œÑ œÑ ‚àí1 ‚àà (U ‚Ä≤ ‚àí U )((œÉU ‚Ä≤ œÉ) ‚àí U ) = (U ‚Ä≤ œÉ ‚àí
U )(U ‚Ä≤ œÉ ‚àí U ), which contradicts our assumption when N = 2.

     Suppose that M       j=1 bj [œÉj ] is in the kernel, i.e.,     j=1 bj ([œÉj ] + [œÉj œÉ]) = 0,
where bj 6= 0, œÉj are pairwise distinct as elements of G/U and M ‚â• 2. Then,
by Lemma 7.1, œÉi U U ‚Ä≤ 6= œÉj U U ‚Ä≤ for i 6= j.
     OneS considers the graph whose vertices are the right U ‚Ä≤ -cosets in the
           M
union j=1 œÉj U U ‚Ä≤ , and whose edges are the sets œÉj U U ‚Ä≤ for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ M
which join the vertices œÉj U ‚Ä≤ and œÉj œÉU ‚Ä≤ . There are at least 2 edges entering
to Pa given vertex, since otherwise this ‚Äúvertex‚Äù is contained in the support
        M

Corollary 7.3. Let 2 ‚â§ n < ‚àû and L‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ‚äÇ F bep        a subfield finitely generated

Proof. One has U U ‚Ä≤ = UL‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (t,u) , U =T(U SU ‚Ä≤ ) T(U U ‚Ä≤ )œÉ, where œÉt =
u ‚àí t and œÉ|L‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (u) = id, and U ‚Ä≤ = (U U ‚Ä≤ ) (U T U ‚Ä≤ )œÑ , where œÑ u = ‚àíu
and œÑ |L‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (t) = id. This implies that U ‚Ä≤ œÉ ‚àí U = (U U ‚Ä≤ )œÑ œÉ and (œÑ œÉ)2 u = u,
(œÑ œÉ)2 t = t + 2u, so for any N ‚â• 1 and anyT œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN ‚àà U ‚Ä≤ œÉ ‚àí U one
has œÑ1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ œÑN 6= 1. Similarly, U œÑ ‚àí U ‚Ä≤ = (U U ‚Ä≤ )œÉœÑ = (U ‚Ä≤ œÉ ‚àí U )‚àí1 , so
for any N ‚â• 1 and any œÑ1 , . . . , œÑN ‚àà U œÑ ‚àí U ‚Ä≤ one has œÑ1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ œÑN 6= 1. It
follows from Lemma 7.2 that there exist embeddings E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] ÷í‚Üí E[G/U ]
and E[G/U ] ÷í‚Üí E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ]. ‚äì    ‚äî

Proof. As E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] embeds naturally into E[G/U ], any subquotient of the
module E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] is a subquotient of E[G/U ]. Let W be the quotient of
E[G/UL‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ] by the sum of the images of E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] under all possible E[G]-
homomorphisms to E[G/UL‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ ]. As in the proof of CH0 (Y[L] ) = Z,15 one
                   2     m
checks that W he1 e2 ¬∑¬∑¬∑em i = 0, and thus, E[G/U ] coincides with the sum of
the images of E[G/U ‚Ä≤ ] under all E[G]-homomorphisms to E[G/U ]. ‚äì      ‚äî

    Remark. Let L be an extension of k of finite type and of transcendence
degree q in F . Then, at least assuming some conjectures, any motivic G-
module of level < q is a subquotient of Q[G/UL ] with infinite multiplicity.
To see this, fix a transcendence basis x1 , . . . , xq of L over k. Then there is
                              s
a surjection Q[G/UL ] ‚àí‚Üí ‚Ñ¶F/k    , given by [1] 7‚àí‚Üí xs+1 dx1 ‚àß ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚àß dxs for

any s < q. Any motivic G-module of level s is a submodule of ‚Ñ¶F/k           with
infinite multiplicity.


A The centers of the Hecke algebras

Lemma A.1. Let K be a compact open subgroup in G. Let ŒΩ ‚àà HE (K)
be an element which is not a E-multiple of hK . Then there exist elements
x1 , . . . , xn ‚àà F K algebraically independent over k such that ŒΩhU 6‚àà E ¬∑ hU ,
where U = Uk(x1 ,...,xn ) ‚äá K.
                       P
Proof. Let ŒΩ =            aj œÉj hK , where the classes of œÉj in G/K are pairwise
distinct. After subtracting a multiple of hK , if necessary, we may suppose
that œÉj 6‚àà K for any j. Then the sets {x ‚àà F K | œÉi x = œÉj x} for i 6= j
and {x ‚àà F K | œÉj x = x} for any j are proper k-subspaces in F K , and
therefore, there exist elements x1 , . . . , xn ‚àà F K algebraically independent
over k with x1 outside their union. These conditions on x1 , . . . , xn imply
that œÉi |k(x1 ,...,xn ) 6= œÉj |k(x1 ,...,xn ) and œÉj |k(x1 ,...,xn ) 6= id for any i 6= j.
     Set S U = Uk(x1 ,...,xn ) . Then the support of the element ŒΩ ‚àó hU coincides
with j œÉj U , which is not a subset in U , so ŒΩ ‚àó hU is not a multiple of hU .
‚äî
‚äì

Lemma A.2. Let U = Uk(x1 ,...,xn ) for some x1 , . . . , xn algebraically inde-
pendent over k, and let ŒΩ be a central element either in the Hecke algebra
                                  ‚ó¶
HE (U ), or in the Hecke algebra HE (U ). Then ŒΩ ‚àà E ¬∑ hU .

Proof. For any œÑ in the normalizer of U one has ŒΩ(hU œÑ hU ) = ŒΩhU œÑ = ŒΩœÑ 6= 0
if ŒΩ 6= 0, and (hU œÑ hU )ŒΩ = œÑ hU ŒΩ = œÑ ŒΩ. We
                                           ` may suppose that the support
of ŒΩ does not contain 1, i.e., Supp(ŒΩ) = œÉ‚ààS U œÉU for a finite subset S in
G ‚àí U.

     Let A be the image of Q[e1 , e2 , . . . , em ] in EndG W . It is a semisimple algebra,
so we want to show that e1 e22 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ em           m 6‚â° 1 modulo any maximal ideal in A. For
                              ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ hei1 ¬∑¬∑¬∑eil i
this
Pd‚àí1  we   note     that    (L  )              is rational for any 1 ‚â§ i1 < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ < il ‚â§ m, so
                          j
  j=0  (e i1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ e il )   =  0. The     assumptions     on m and d imply that modulo any
maximal ideal in A the element e1 e22 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ em          m is a non-trivial root of unity.

    Let H = {œÑ ‚àà G | œÑ |k(xj ) ‚àà Aut(k(xj )/k) for all 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ n}, and for
each 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ n let the subfield Lj be generated over k by x1 , . . . , xbj , . . . , xn .
As ŒΩ is a central element in H(U ), one has œÑ ŒΩœÑ ‚àí1 = ŒΩ for all œÑ ‚àà H. In
particular, Supp(œÑ ŒΩœÑ ‚àí1 ) = Supp(ŒΩ), so each œÑ ‚àà H induces a permutation
of the set S of double U -classes. The subgroup U ‚äÇ H acts trivially on S,
so the action of H on S factors through the quotient H/U ‚àº             = (PGL2 k) .
                                                                                      n
                                         n
Any homomorphism from (PGL2 k) to the permutation group of the set S,
is trivial, since any element of PGL2 k is (#S)!-th power of another element
of PGL2 k, and therefore, U œÑ œÉœÑ ‚àí1 U = U œÉU for any œÉ ‚àà S. In particular,
œÑ œÉœÑ ‚àí1 xj is in the finite set U œÉxj for all œÑ ‚àà H; or, even more particularly,
the set of fields k(œÑ œÉxj ) for all œÑ ‚àà H is finite.
    Fix some j. Suppose that œÉxj 6‚àà k(xj ) (this implies that n > 1). Then
there is 1 ‚â§ s ‚â§ n different from j such that F is algebraic over Ls (œÉxj ).
Set Hj = {œÑ ‚àà ULs | œÑ |k(xs ) ‚àà Aut(k(xs )/k)}. Then for any œÑ ‚àà Hj one
has œÑ œÉœÑ ‚àí1 xj = œÑ œÉxj , so the Hj -orbit of œÉxj should be finite, and thus, a
subgroup of finite index in Hj should be compact, so the group Hj should
be compact itself, which is false.
    As U œÑ œÉœÑ ‚àí1 U = U œÉU is equivalent to U œÑ œÉ ‚àí1 œÑ ‚àí1 U = U œÉ ‚àí1 U , we get
œÉ ¬±1 xj ‚àà k(xj ). If œÉ ¬±1 xj 6‚àà k(xj ) then k(œÉ ¬±1 xj , xj )/k(xj ) has a non-empty
branch locus. The PGL2 k-orbit of any point on P1k is infinite, so the PGL2 k-
orbit of the branch locus is also infinite, which means that the set of fields
k(œÑ œÉ ¬±1 xj ) is infinite, unless k(œÉ ¬±1 xj ) is a subfield in k(xj ). Then k(xj ) =
œÉk(œÉ ‚àí1 xj ) ‚äÜ œÉk(xj ) = k(œÉxj ) ‚äÜ k(xj ). As the center of PGL2 k is trivial,
this shows that œÉ|k(xj ) = id. When varying j, we get œÉ ‚àà U , contradicting
our assumptions. ‚äì      ‚äî

Lemma A.3. Let K be a compact subgroup in G. If n < ‚àû and ŒΩ ‚àà
HE (K) ‚àí E ¬∑ hK then there exists a compact open subgroup U containing K
such that ŒΩ ‚àó hU 6‚àà E ¬∑ hU .

Proof. There is some œÉ in the support of ŒΩ outside of K, i.e., if U ‚Ä≤ is an open
compact subgroup in G not containing œÉ then there is an open subgroup
U ‚äÜ U ‚Ä≤ such that ŒΩ(œÉU ) 6= 0, and therefore, the support of ŒΩhU contains œÉ,
so it is non-empty and it does not coincide with U . ‚äì ‚äî

     As a corollary of these statements we get

Theorem A.4. Let K be a compact subgroup in G. Then the centers of the
                           ‚ó¶
Hecke algebras HE (K) and HE (K) coincide with E ¬∑ hK if n < ‚àû.

Proof. Clearly, for any pair of compact subgroups K ‚äÜ U the multiplication
                                                                       hU ‚àó
by hU : ŒΩ 7‚àí‚Üí ŒΩhU gives homomorphisms of the centers Z(HE (K)) ‚àí‚Üí
                        ‚ó¶       Uh ‚àó  ‚ó¶
Z(HE (U )) and Z(HE       (K)) ‚àí‚Üí Z(HE  (U )). Then by Lemma A.3, we may
suppose that K is open. By Lemma A.1, we may further suppose that
                                                                     ‚ó¶
K = Uk(x1 ,...,xn ) . Then, by Lemma A.2, the centers of HE (K) and HE (K)
coincide with E ¬∑ hK . ‚äì   ‚äî

B The case of positive characteristic

In this appendix we show that all results of ¬ß2 and ¬ß6 remain valid in the
case of char(k) = p > 0.
    The topology on G is the same as described in Introduction. The group
G is also Hausdorff, locally compact if n < ‚àû, and totally disconnected;
the subgroups G{F,(FŒ± )Œ±‚ààI }/k are closed in G, the fibers of the morphism of

   The inverse correspondences are given by G ‚äÉ H 7‚àí‚Üí F H .
    Proof of Lemma 2.1. We may suppose that L and all LŒ± are perfect.
Then, after replacing the reference to the Galois correspondence of ¬ß2 with
the reference to the Galois correspondence of this appendix, the proof in ¬ß2
goes through. ‚äì  ‚äî
    Proof of Lemma 2.2. First, replace L with its ‚Äúperfectization‚Äù. Let ‚Ñì ‚àà
{2, 3} ‚àí {p}. Then any element œÑ in the common normalizer in G of all
closed subgroups of index ‚â§ ‚Ñì in UL satisfies œÑ (L(f 1/‚Ñì )) = L(f 1/‚Ñì ) for all
f ‚àà L√ó . If œÑ 6‚àà UL then there is an element x ‚àà L√ó such that œÑ x/x 6= 1.
Then œÑ x/x = y ‚Ñì for some y ‚àà F √ó ‚àí ¬µ‚Ñì . Set f = x + Œª for a variable
Œª ‚àà k. By Kummer theory,
                             œÑ f /f ‚àà L√ó‚Ñì , and therefore, L contains L0 :=
          ‚àí‚Ñì 1/‚Ñì
k y (x+Œªy   )
      (x+Œª)1/‚Ñì
               | Œª ‚àà k ‚äÇ k(x, y).
   Now we come back to our original L and replace L0 with the subfield gen-
                                                  ‚àí‚Ñì 1/‚Ñì
erated by appropriate p-primary powers of y (x+Œªy   )
                                              (x+Œª)1/‚Ñì
                                                         , where p = char(k).
As tr.deg(k(x, y)/k) ‚â§ 2, by our assumption on L, the subfield L0 of L
should be finitely generated over k. But this is possible only if y ‚Ñì = 1, i.e.,
if œÑ ‚àà UL . (To see this, one can choose a smooth model of the extension
L0 (x)/k(x, y) over k and look at itsTbranch locus.) ‚äì   ‚äî
    Proof of Lemma 2.4. Let œÉ ‚àà H U ‚àí{1} and k ‚Ä≤ be the algebraic closure
in F of any subfield in F hœÉi with tr.deg(F/k ‚Ä≤ ) = 1. As the extension F/F hœÉi
is abelian there is an element x ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ and an integer N ‚â• 2 such that
œÉx 6= x and either œÉxN = xN , or œÉ(xp ‚àíx) = xp ‚àíx. Then one has œÉ(k ‚Ä≤ ) = k ‚Ä≤
and œÉ(k ‚Ä≤ (x)) = k ‚Ä≤ (x).
    The rest of the proof is the same as the last two paragraphs of the proof
in ¬ß2. ‚äì ‚äî
60                                                                   M.Rovinsky


    Proof of Lemma 2.5 in ¬ß2 remains valid, after we replace L‚Ä≤ with its
perfect closure in LL‚Ä≤ , but we do not claim that the inclusion PGL2 k ÷í‚Üí
NG‚ó¶ UL‚Ä≤ /UL‚Ä≤ is an isomorphism. ‚äì       ‚äî
    Proof of Lemma 2.7. We proceed by induction on m, the case m = 0 be-
ing trivial. We wish to find wm ‚àà F such that w and Œæwm are algebraically
independent over k ‚Ä≤ generated over k by w1 , . . . , wm‚àí1 , Œæw1 , . . . , Œæwm‚àí1 .
Suppose that there is no such wm . Then for any u ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ and any
v ‚àà F ‚àík ‚Ä≤ (Œæu) one has the following vanishings in ‚Ñ¶k2‚Ä≤ (u,v,Œæu,Œæv)/k‚Ä≤ : du‚àßdŒæu =
dv ‚àß dŒæv = 0, d(u + v) ‚àß dŒæ(u + v) = 0, and d(u + v ‚Ñì ) ‚àß dŒæ(u + v ‚Ñì ) = 0 for
any integer ‚Ñì ‚â• 2 prime to p := char(k). Applying the first two to the third,
we get ‚Ñì(v ‚Ñì‚àí1 ‚àí Œæv ‚Ñì‚àí1 )dv ‚àß dŒæu = 0, which means that either Œæv ‚Ñì‚àí1 = v ‚Ñì‚àí1
for any v ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ (Œæu), or dv = 0 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶k1‚Ä≤ (v,Œæv)/k‚Ä≤ for all v ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ , or
dŒæu = 0 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶k1‚Ä≤ (u,Œæu)/k‚Ä≤ for all u ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ . In the first case Œæv = v for any
v ‚àà F , i.e., Œæ = 1.
    If Œæ(k ‚Ä≤ ) 6= k ‚Ä≤ then there exists u ‚àà k ‚Ä≤ such that Œæu ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ . Fix some
v ‚àà F ‚àí (k ‚Ä≤ (Œæu) ‚à™ Œæ ‚àí1 (k ‚Ä≤ )). Even if Œæv ‚àà k ‚Ä≤ (v), the element Œæ(uv) does not
belong to k ‚Ä≤ (v) = k ‚Ä≤ (uv), i.e., Œæ(uv) and uv are algebraically independent
over k ‚Ä≤ .
    We may, thus, suppose that Œæ(k ‚Ä≤ ) = k ‚Ä≤ . Replacing Œæ with Œæ ‚àí1 , we reduce
the case dŒæu = 0 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶k1‚Ä≤ (u,Œæu)/k‚Ä≤ to the case du = 0 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶k1‚Ä≤ (u,Œæu)/k‚Ä≤ for all
                             s
u ‚àà F ‚àí k ‚Ä≤ . Let P (X, Y p ) be the minimal polynomial of Œæu over k ‚Ä≤ [u] with
maximal possible integer s ‚â• 1.
    Replacing Œæ by Frs Œæ, where Fr is the Frobenius automorphism, we get
that du 6= 0 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶k1‚Ä≤ (u,Œæu)/k‚Ä≤ . As this implies Œæ = 1, we get contradiction, since
no non-zero power of the Frobenius automorphism is identical on k. This
shows that there exists desired wm ‚àà F . ‚äì       ‚äî
    Proof of Proposition 2.14. We may suppose that L1 and L2 are perfect.
Then the proof in ¬ß2 goes through. ‚äì       ‚äî
    Proofs of Lemmas 2.6, 2.8, 2.12, 2.15 and 2.16, Theorem 2.9, and Corol-
