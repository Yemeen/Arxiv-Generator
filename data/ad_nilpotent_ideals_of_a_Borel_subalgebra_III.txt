                                                  result is a nice uniform formula for the dimension of maximal ideals in these posets.
                                                  We also obtain results on ad-nilpotent ideals which complete the analysis started in

                                                In this paper we investigate in detail certain remarkable posets of abelian ideals
                                             Iab (τ, α) of a Borel subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra. These posets depend upon
                                             a long root α and an element τ of the coroot lattice (subject to certain natural
                                             restrictions), and form a partition of all abelian ideals of a Borel subalgebra. As a
                                             consequence of our analysis we may deduce uniform formulas for the dimensions of
                                             maximal and minimal ideals in Iab (τ, α). Our work generalizes and refines the work
                                             of Panyushev and Suter on similar topics, using as a key tool the combinatorics
                                             of affine Weyl groups and root systems. Our formulas also provide a uniform
                                             explanation of classical Malcev’s results on the maximal dimension of an abelian
                                             subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra. In order to explain more precisely our results
                                             we need to set the basic framework.
                                                Let g be a complex simple Lie algebra of rank n. Let b ⊂ g be a fixed Borel
                                             subalgebra, with Cartan component h; let ∆+ be the positive system of the root
                                             system ∆ of g corresponding to the previous choice, and Π = {α1 , . . . , αn } be the
                                             associated set of simple roots. Let Q, Q∨ be the root and coroot lattices, and W
                                             be the Weyl group of g. For each α ∈ ∆+ let gα denote the root space of g relative
                                             to α. Denote by Iab the set of abelian ideals of b.
                                                The class Iab has been introduced in [K1], but the paper that started the recent
                                             research activity on the subject is the long research announcement [K2]. In this
                                             paper Kostant established deep connections between the combinatorics of abelian
                                             ideals, the machinery of Cartan decompositions and the theory of discrete series
                                             (for developments in this direction see also [CMP]) . His work is partly based on
                                             a simple but surprising result due to D. Peterson (the so-called Peterson’s 2rk(g)
                                             abelian ideals theorem): the abelian ideals may be encoded and in turn enumerated
                                             through elements in a certain subset Wab of the affine Weyl group W   c of g. In [CP2]
                                             we extended this encoding, say i 7→ wi , to the set I of ideals of b contained in [b, b].
                                             These ideals are characterized, among the ideals of b, by the following property:

for any x ∈ i, ad(x) : g → g is a nilpotent endomorphism, hence we call them ad-
nilpotent ideals. Moreover we gave a characterization of the image of the map i 7→ wi
       c . Reformulating this characterization in terms of the affine representation
inside W
   c allowed us to describe a suitable simplex D in h∗ whose Q∨ -points parametrize
of W                                                    R
I (see [CP3]). In such a way we obtained a bijection between I and certain W -
orbits in the coroot lattice of g, which affords a uniform enumeration of I. A short
part of section 3 of this paper is devoted to give results on I which complete the
analysis started in our previous papers and which have been announced in [CP3]:
we characterize the ideals in I having a fixed class of nilpotence in terms of elements
of D ∩ Q∨ and the generators of i ∈ I as a b-module in terms of wi .
    The remaining and more extended part of the paper deals with abelian ideals.
Recall from [CP2] that if i ∈ Iab and wi = tτ v, where tτ is the translation by
τ ∈ Q∨ , and v ∈ W , then τ belongs to set X of Q∨ -points lying in twice the closure
of the fundamental alcove of W  c . We provide a general description of the elements
of X as orthogonal sums of highest roots of nested standard irreducible parabolic
subsystems of ∆. This result turns out to be a very useful technical device for our
goals.
    We begin our analysis decomposing Iab w.r.t. X: the map Wab → X, tτ v 7→ τ
is surjective, thus we have a partition into non-empty sets
                                             [
                                    Iab =           Iab (τ ),
                                             τ ∈X


Iab (τ ) being the set of ideals i whose wi has tτ as translational part. In [K2]
and [CMP] it is shown that Iab (τ ) is in canonical bijection with Wτ \W , where,
if kτ is the
          √ equal rank symmetric subalgebra of g formed by the fixed points of
Ad(exp( −1πτ ), Wτ denotes the Weyl group of (kτ , h). In the following discussion
we list our main results.
   We prove that, for all τ ∈ X, Iab (τ ) has a unique minimal element; moreover we
describe explicitly the maximal elements of Iab (τ ). If τ = 0, then Iab (τ ) consists
just of the zero ideal, so assume τ 6= 0. If i is maximal in Iab (τ ), then wi−1 (−θ + 2δ)
is a long simple root (here θ is the highest root of ∆ and δ is the fundamental
imaginary root of the affine system ∆  b attached to ∆). So we are led to consider,
for any α in the set Πℓ of long simple roots, the subposets

                 Iab (τ, α) = {i ∈ Iab | wi = tτ v, wi−1 (−θ + 2δ) = α}.

For any i ∈ Iab (τ ), wi−1 (−θ+2δ) belongs to ∆ and is a long positive root. We denote
by ∆+ ℓ the set of long positive roots in ∆ and extend the definition of Iab (τ, α) to
all α in ∆+
          ℓ . Thus we have
                                              [
                                Iab (τ ) =           Iab (τ, α).
                                             α∈∆+
                                                ℓ



Iab (τ, α) is possibly empty; we give an explicit criterion for Iab (τ, α) to be non-
empty. We prove that if Iab (τ, α) 6= ∅, then it has unique minimal and maximal
elements. More precisely, we prove that the poset Iab (τ, α) is order isomorphic to the
coset space W ((Π ∩ α⊥ ) \ Pτ,α)\W (Π ∩ α⊥ ) (see 7.6 for the precise definition of Pτ,α
               ad-NILPOTENT IDEALS OF A BOREL SUBALGEBRA III                                 3

and 2.8, 2.9 for the definition of the poset of cosets.) This result is a generalization
of [S, Theorem 11]. We explicitly describe elements wτ , yτ,α , y̌τ,α ∈ W c such that

  i(wτ ) = min Iab (τ ),   i(wτ yτ,α ) = min Iab (τ, α),    i(wτ y̌τ,α ) = max Iab (τ, α).

The ideals max Iab (τ, α) for all simple roots α such that Iab (τ, α) 6= ∅ are exactly
the maximal elements of Iab (τ ).
   For α ∈ ∆+        ℓ set Xα = {τ ∈ X | Iab (τ, α) 6= ∅}. Then Xα is chain in Q ,
                                                                                      ∨

in the standard partial order, and its minimal element is θ ∨ . Assume Xα =
{τ1 , . . . , τk(α) }, θ ∨ = τ1 < . . . < τk(α) , and denote by mh (α) the maximal ideal
in Iab (τh , α). Then a careful analysis of the elements of W    c corresponding to the
ideals mh (α) allows us to prove that

                             m1 (α) ⊂ . . . . . . ⊂ mk(α) (α).

The proof of these inclusion relations gives a clear explanation of the “shell-like”
structure of the elements of Wab noted in [S, §5]. Moreover it gives as a by-product
a case-free proof of the following nice result, due to Suter [S, Corollary 13], which
holds for the maximal abelian ideals m(α) = mk(α) (α), α ∈ Πℓ of b:

                                                 1 b            
                       dim (m(α)) = g − 1 +        |∆α | − |∆α |
                                                 2

where ∆b α , ∆α are the (finite) subsystems generated by the simple roots orthogonal
        b ∆ respectively, and g is the dual Coxeter number of ∆.
to α in ∆,
   In particular we obtain a uniform version of Malcev’s formulas for the dimension
of maximal commutative subalgebras of g: if d denotes the dimension of such a
subalgebra, we have
                                   d = dim mk(α) (α).
where α is a long simple root having maximal distance from the affine node in the
extended Dynkin diagram of ∆.
   Then we show that, when α ∈ Πℓ , mk(α) (α) is a maximal abelian ideal of b
and that each maximal abelian ideal of b occurs in this way for a unique α ∈ Πℓ .
Hence the map α 7→ mk(α) (α) is a bijection between Πℓ and maximal ideals in Iab ;
the same bijection has been shown via a case by case verification in [PR] and in a
uniform way in [P, Corollary 3.8].
   Finally, we find a general dimension formula for all the ideals mh (α). In the
above notation, to each pair (α, h), 1 ≤ h < k(α), α ∈ ∆+  ℓ we associate a finite
                               b
irreducible subsystem ∆h,α of ∆ and we prove that

                                                  h−1
                                                  X
                       dim (mh (α)) = g − 1 +           (gh (α) − 1)
                                                  i=1

where gh (α) is the dual Coxeter number of ∆h,α .
    The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we recall some basic facts about
affine root systems and Coxeter groups. In section 3 we recall our encoding of ad-
nilpotent ideals of g via the affine Weyl group and we prove the two results on I

stated above. In section 4 we characterize the maximal abelian ideals of b in terms
of the corresponding elements in W c . In section 5 we give a structure theorem for
the elements of X. In section 6 we introduce Iab (τ ), we describe its unique minimal
element and begin the study of the maximal elements, proving that they should
belong to Iab (τ, α) with α ∈ Πℓ . Section 7 is devoted to the proof of the existence
of unique minimal and maximal elements in Iab (τ, α). In section 8 we give the
explicit description of the maximal elements mh (α) which leads to our dimension
formulas. The last section deals with the explicit computation of dim (mh (α)) for
any admissible pair (h, α), α ∈ Πℓ .

Notational conventions. If R is a root system we shall denote by ∆+ (R), Q(R)
Q+ (R), W (R) the positive roots, the root lattice, the positive root lattice and the
Weyl group of R, respectively. If Y is a subset of R, we shall also use the notation
∆(Y ), and W (Y ), to denote the subsystem generated by Y , and its Weyl group,
respectively. If R is irreducible, we set θ(R) to be its highest root. We reserve the
symbols ∆+ , Q, Q+ , θ, W for the same data relative to the root system ∆ of g.
   If R is simply laced we shall regard all roots as long.
   The maximal irreducible subsystems of a root system R will be called the com-
ponents of R.       Pn
   For α ∈ Q, α = i=1 λi αi we set Supp(α) = {αi | λi 6= 0}.
   We shall mainly use two partial orderings throughout the paper, both denoted
by ≤: we shall endow Q (or Q∨ ) with the usual order: α < β if β − α is a sum of
positive roots (resp. coroots). Further we shall regard W and W   c as posets via the
weak order (more precisely the weak left Bruhat order with respect to the standard
set of Coxeter generators, see [H, 5.9]). Subsets of W or W  c will be endowed with
the restriction of ≤. Only in one instance we shall use the Bruhat order: it will be
denoted by <B .
   We shall denote by A \B the set difference of A and B, and by A + B the
symmetric difference of the sets A, B. For k ∈ N+ , we set [k] = {1, . . . , k}.

            §2 Affine root systems and combinatorics of roots

   Our basic tools are the standard theory of affine Weyl groups and some com-
binatorial properties of root systems. This section is devoted to recollect these
topics.
                      Ln
   We set V ≡ h∗R =       Rαi and denote by ( , ) the positive symmetric bilinear
                        i=1
form induced on V by the Killing form. The affine root system associated to ∆
can be introduced as follows [Kac, Chapter 6]. We extend V and its inner product
setting Vb = V ⊕ Rδ ⊕ Rλ, (δ, δ) = (δ, V ) = (λ, λ) = (λ, V ) = 0, and (δ, λ) = 1.
We still denote by ( , ) the resulting (non-degenerate) bilinear form. The affine
root system associated to ∆ is ∆   b = ∆ + Zδ = {α + kδ | α ∈ ∆, k ∈ Z}; remark
that the affine roots are non isotropic vectors. The set of positive affine roots is
b + = (∆+ + Nδ) ∪ (∆− + N+ δ), where ∆− = −∆+ . We denote by θ the highest
∆
root of ∆ and set α0 = −θ + δ, Π   b = {α0 , . . . , αn }. We sometimes call the roots of
∆ inside ∆b the “finite roots”. For each α ∈ ∆   b + we denote by sα the corresponding
reflection of Vb , sα (x) = x − 2(α,x)              b
                                (α,α) x for x ∈ V . The affine Weyl group associated
to ∆ is the group W   c generated by {sα | α ∈ ∆     b + }; the set {sα | α ∈ Π}
                                                                              b is a set of

Coxeter generators for W  c ; we denote by ℓ the corresponding length function. Note
that w(δ) = δ for any w ∈ W   c . It turns out that W
                                                    c is a semidirect product T ⋊ W ,
where T = {tτ | τ ∈ Q∨ } ∼   = Q∨ is the subgroup of translations, and the action of
                 −1
W on T is vtτ v = tv(τ ) . The action of tτ on V ⊕ Rδ, in particular on the roots,
is given by tτ (x) = x − (x, τ )δ, for each x ∈ V ⊕ Rδ. (See [Kac] for the general
definition of tτ on Vb ).
   Now consider the W  c -invariant affine subspace E = {x ∈ Vb | (x, δ) = 1}. Remark
that E = V ⊕ Rδ + λ; let π : E → V be the natural projection. For w ∈ W      c we set
w = π ◦w|E . We have that the map w 7→ w gives an isomorphism of W     c onto a group
Waf of affine transformations of V [Kac, 6.6]. Under this isomorphism each element
tτ of T maps to the true translation by τ . So Waf is the usual affine representation
of the affine Weyl group [B, VI, §2]. In fact, for α ∈ ∆+ and k ∈ Z set

                             Hα,k = {x ∈ V | (x, α) = k}

and let sα,k denote the orthogonal reflection with respect to Hα,k in V . For β ∈ Vb ,
    b β be the hyperplane orthogonal to β in Vb . Then it is easy to see that, for each
let H
α ∈ ∆+ , k > 0 and h ≥ 0, we have
                       b −α+kδ ∩ E) = Hα,k ,
                     π(H                              s−α+kδ = sα,k ,
                       b α+hδ ∩ E) = Hα,−h ,
                     π(H                              sα+hδ = sα,−h .

Hence we have a transparent correspondence between the linear and the affine
context. Henceforward we shall omit the bar and use the same notation for the
            c and the corresponding elements Waf . We denote by C is the funda-
elements in W
                  c and by C1 the fundamental alcove of Waf ,
mental chamber of W

                     C = {x ∈ Vb | (x, αi ) > 0 for i = 0, . . . , n},
                     C1 = {x ∈ V | (x, α) > 0 ∀α ∈ Π, (x, θ) < 1}
                        = {x ∈ V | 0 < (x, α) < 1 ∀α ∈ ∆+ }.

Then we have C1 = π(C ∩ E). This implies the following result.

2.1. For any α ∈ ∆+ , k ∈ N+ , h ∈ N

           w−1 (−α + kδ) < 0 if and only if Hα,k separates C1 and w(C1 ),
           w−1 (α + hδ) < 0 if and only if Hα,−h separates C1 and w(C1 ).


2.2. For j > 0 set

                   Cj = {x ∈ V | (x, α) > 0 ∀α ∈ Π, (x, θ) < j};

also set
                     C∞ = {x ∈ V | (x, αi ) > 0 for i = 1, . . . , n}.
Thus C∞ is the fundamental chamber of W . The walls of Cj are the hyperplanes,
Hαi ,0 , 1 ≤ i ≤ n and Hθ,j , so that Cj = jC1 . For all β ∈ ∆+ and x ∈ C∞ we have
(x, β) ≤ (x, θ). In particular we obtain that if Hβ,k ∩ C2 6= ∅, then k = 1.

 2.3. Let R be a finite or affine root system. Choose the set R+ of positive roots,
 and denote by RΣ the corresponding set of simple roots. Let G be the Weyl group
 of R; for α ∈ R+ we denote by sα the reflection with respect to α. For v ∈ G we
 set
                          N (v) = {β ∈ R+ | v −1 (β) < 0}.

 Moreover, we denote by Lv the set of left descents of v:

                               Lv = {α ∈ RΣ | ℓ(sα v) < ℓ(v)}.

 Similarly we define the set of right descents of v as Rv = {α ∈ RΣ | ℓ(vsα ) < ℓ(v)}.
    The following facts are well known; proofs and details about (3) and (4) can be
 found in [D], [CP1]. Item (5) follows from (3).
(1) Lv = N (v) ∩ RΣ ;
(2) α ∈ Lv if and only if there exists a reduced expression of v starting with sα .
(3) N (v) is finite, closed under root addition and, moreover, if β1 , . . . , βk ∈ R+ ,
    c1 , . . . , ck ∈ R+ , and c1 β1 + · · · + ck βk ∈ N (v), then βi ∈ N (v) for at least one
    i ∈ {1, . . . , k}.
(4) Conversely, if R ∼     6 A
                            = b1 , and N ⊆ R+ is a finite set which satisfies the following
    conditions:
      (a) N is closed under root addition,
      (b) for all β1 , β2 ∈ R+ such that β1 + β2 ∈ N , at least one of β1 , β2 belongs
          to N ,
     then there exists v ∈ W (R) such that N = N (v). If R ∼  =A  b1 , then the sets N (v),
     v ∈ W (R), are exactly all the sets {−α + iδ | 1 ≤ i ≤ k}, for all k ∈ N+ , and
     {α + iδ | 0 ≤ i ≤ k}, for all k ∈ N, where α is the finite simple root.
(5) Let I ⊆ RΣ . Then Lv ⊆ I if and only if for all α ∈ N (v) we have Supp(α)∩I 6= ∅.

   We describe explicitly the set N (v). Part (1) of the following statement is clear;
 part (2) is well-known [B, VI, 1.6].

 2.4. Let w ∈ G and let w = σ1 · · · σk be any reduced expression of w with σi = sβi ,
 βi ∈ RΣ . If we set γ1 = β1 , γ2 = σ1 (β2 ), . . . , γk = σ1 · · · σk−1 (βk ), then we have:
     (1) w = sγk · · · sγ2 sγ1 .
     (2) N (w) = {γ1 , . . . , γk }.


 2.5 We also set N (v) = N (v) ∪ −N (v). It is easy to see that for any u, v ∈ G we
 have
                             N (vu) = N (v) + vN (u),

 where we denote by + the symmetric difference of sets.

    We recall that the weak order ≤ of G is defined as follows: for v, v ′ ∈ G, we
 have v ≤ v ′ if and only if there exists an element u ∈ G such that v ′ = vu, ℓ(v ′ ) =
 ℓ(v) + ℓ(u). From 2.4 and 2.5 we easily obtain the following characterization of the
 weak order.

2.6. v ≤ v ′ if and only if N (v) ⊆ N (v ′ ).

   Moreover, we have the following results.
2.7. The following conditions (1), (2), (3) and (4) are equivalent:
(1) N (vu) ⊇ N (v); (2) vN (u) ⊆ ∆+ ; (3) ℓ(vu) = ℓ(v) + ℓ(u); (4) v ≤ vu.
    Similarly, the following conditions (1′ ), (2′ ), (3′ ) and (4′ ) are equivalent:
(1 ) N (vu) ⊆ N (v); (2′ ) vN (u) ⊆ ∆− ; (3′ ) ℓ(vu) = ℓ(v) − ℓ(u); (4′ ) v ≥ vu.

   Let G′ be a standard parabolic subgroup of G, and let R′ be its root system.
Recall that any v ∈ G can be decomposed as v = v ′ v ′′ where v ′ ∈ G′ and v ′′ is an
element of minimal length in the right coset G′ v; moreover, v ′ , v ′′ are unique. It
follows that
2.8. For all v ∈ G there exists v ′ ∈ G′ such that N (v) ∩ R′ = N (v ′ ).
   Set moreover R′′ = R \R′ . It is well known that y ∈ G′ x is the minimal length
representative of the right coset G′ x if and only if Ly ⊆ R′′ . Therefore, {y ∈ G |
Ly ⊆ R′′ } is the set of minimal length representatives for the set of right cosets
G′ \G. Thus the restriction of the weak order of G on {y ∈ G | Ly ⊆ R′′ } induces
a partial ordering on G′ \G. When saying the poset G′ \G, we shall always refer to
this ordering.

2.9. The poset G′ \G has a unique minimal and a unique maximal element.
The identity 1 of G clearly corresponds to the minimum of G′ \G. If w0 is the
longest element of of G and w0′ is the longest element of G′ , then we have that
N (w0′ w0 ) = ∆+ (R) \∆+ (R′ ). By 2.3 (5), if y ∈ G is such that Ly ⊆ R′′ , then
N (y) ⊆ ∆+ (R) \∆+ (R′ ); therefore we obtain that w0′ w0 is the unique maximal ele-
ment in {y ∈ G | Ly ⊆ R′′ }, with respect to the weak order. Thus w0′ w0 corresponds
to the unique maximal element of G′ \G.



               §3 ad-nilpotent ideals via affine Weyl groups

   We turn now toP  ad-nilpotent ideals. Recall from [CP2, §2] that to any ad-
nilpotent ideal i =   gα we can associate a set of positive roots in the affine root
                     α∈Φ
system attached to g in the following way:
                                     [            
                             L(i) =      −Φki + kδ ,
                                        k≥1

where Φ1i = Φ and Φki = (Φk−1i   + Φ) ∩ ∆, k ≥ 2. In [CP2, Prop. 2.4] we proved
                                  c such that N (wi ) = L(i). Set
that there exists a (unique) wi ∈ W
                     W = {wi | i ∈ I} ,         Wab = {wi | i ∈ Iab } ,
so that i 7→ wi is a bijection I → W, restricting to a bijection Iab → Wab . The
inverse map will be denoted by w 7→ i(w).
   The sets W, Wab have been characterized in our previous papers.

Proposition 3.1. (1) [CP3, Prop. 2] Let w ∈ W  c , w = tτ v, τ ∈ Q∨ , v ∈ W . Then
w ∈ W if and only if the following conditions hold:
     (i) w(C1 ) ⊂ C∞ ;
    (ii) (v −1 (τ ), αi ) ≤ 1 for each i ∈ [n] and (τ, v(θ)) ≥ −2.
(2) [CP2, Th. 2.9] w ∈ Wab if and only if w(C1 ) ⊂ C2 .


    An obvious but useful observation is the following remark (see 2.6).

3.2. For i, j ∈ I, the following conditions are equivalent:
                 (1) i ⊆ j;    (2) N (wi ) ⊆ N (wj );   (3) wi ≤ wj .

   Finally, we remark that the construction given at the beginning of the section
is quite simple in the special case of abelian ideals. Indeed, we have the following
result.

Proposition 3.3. (Peterson, see also [CP2, section 2]) Let i ∈ Iab . Then N (wi ) =
{−α + δ | gα ⊆ i}. In particular, dim(i) = ℓ(wi ).
  Conversely,   assume that w ∈ W  c is such that N (w) ⊆ ∆− + δ and set i =
   P
           gα . Then i ∈ Iab .
−α+δ∈N(w)



   The next results complete the analysis developed in [CP2], [CP3], showing once
again that all the combinatorial information regarding ad-nilpotent ideals can be
recovered fromPwi .
Remark that       gα ∈ I if and only if Φ is a dual order ideal of ∆+ endowed with
               α∈Φ
the usual partial order, i.e., if and only if, for all α ∈ Φ and β ∈ ∆+ such that
α ≤ β, we have that β ∈ Φ.
   For all i ∈ I we set
                               Φi = {β ∈ ∆+ | gβ ⊆ i},
and denote by Ai the set of minimal elements of Φi . It is clear that Ai is an
antichain of ∆+ , i.e. a set of incomparable elements. As explained in [CP3, §4 (1)],
Φi is completely determined by Ai .

Proposition 3.4. For i ∈ I the following statements are equivalent:
  (1) wi (αi ) = β − δ, β ∈ ∆+ for some i, 0 ≤ i ≤ n;
  (2) β ∈ Ai .

Proof. (1) =⇒ (2). We have wi (αi ) = β − δ < 0; hence, wi si (αi ) = −β + δ > 0.
By 2.7, it follows that N (wi ) = N (wi si ) ∪ {−β + δ}. If there exists γ ∈ Φi such
that β > γ, then −γ + δ is equal to −β + δ plus a sum of roots in ∆+ . But
−γ + δ ∈ N (wi ), hence −γ + δ ∈ N (wi si ), and since −β + δ 6∈ N (wi si ), by 2.3
(3) we obtain that some root in ∆+ belongs to N (wi si ). This is not possible, since
N (wi si ) ⊆ N (wi ) ⊆ ∆− + N+ δ.
(2) =⇒ (1). Let β ∈ Φi be minimal. We shall prove that L(i) \{−β + δ} verifies
                                                                         c such that
conditions (a) and (b) of 2.3 (4). This will imply that there exists w ∈ W
L(i) \{−β + δ} = N (w); hence, by 2.6 and 2.5, wi = wsi for some i ∈ {0, . . . , n} and
                ad-NILPOTENT IDEALS OF A BOREL SUBALGEBRA III                              9

wi (αi ) = −w(αi ) = β − δ. Set N = L(i) \{−β + δ}. Since N ⊆ ∆− + N+ δ, no pair of
roots in N sum up to −β + δ; since, moreover, L(i) is closed under root addition we
obtain that N is closed, too. It remains to prove that (b) holds. Assume η ∈ N and
                            b + . If η1 , η2 6= −β+δ, we are done since (b) holds for L(i).
η = η1 +η2 , with η1 , η2 ∈ ∆
We assume that η1 = −β + δ and prove that then η2 ∈ N . Set η = −η + kδ, k > 0,
η ∈ ∆+ . We prove the claim by induction on k. First notice that η2 6∈ ∆+ + Nδ,
since, if η2 = α + (k − 1)δ with α ∈ ∆+ , then −η = −β + α, which implies β > η
against the minimality of β in Φi . So we may assume η2 = −α + (k − 1)δ, k > 1,
α ∈ ∆+ . We first assume k = 2, so that η = (−β + δ) + (−α + δ). By assumption
η ∈ Φ2i , hence η = β ′ + α′ with β ′ , α′ ∈ Φi . Moreover we have that η = β + α,
hence 0 < (α′ + β ′ , α + β) = (α′ , α) + (α′ , β) + (β ′ , α) + (β ′ , β). It follows that
at least one of the scalar products in the right hand side of the above identity is
positive. If (α′ , α) > 0, then α′ − α ∈ ∆, and since β = β ′ + (α′ − α), we obtain
that α′ − α < 0, by the minimality of β in Φi . Since −α′ + δ = −α + δ + (α − α′ ),
−α′ + δ ∈ L(i), α − α′ ∈ ∆+ \L(i), and L(i) has property (b), we obtain that
−α + δ ∈ L(i), hence −α + δ ∈ N . If (β ′ , α) > 0, we obtain similarly that
−α + δ ∈ N . So we assume that (α′ , β) > 0. Then by minimality of β we have that
α′ − β ∈ ∆+ , hence α − β ′ = α′ − β ∈ ∆+ and we can argue as in the previous
case, so obtaining that −α + δ ∈ N . The case (β ′ , β) > 0 is similar. Thus we
have proved the claim for k = 2. Now we assume k > 2 and the claim true for
k − 1. By assumption we have η = β ′ + α′ with α′ ∈ Φk−1      i    and β ′ ∈ Φi . Arguing
as above, we find that at least one of (α′ , α), (α′ , β), (β ′ , α), (β ′ , β), is positive.
If (α′ , α) > 0, then by minimality of β we obtain that α − α′ > 0; moreover
−α′ + (k − 1)δ = −α + (k − 1)δ + (α − α′ ), and since −α′ + (k − 1)δ ∈ L(i) and
α − α′ ∈   / L(i) we obtain that −α + (k − 1)δ ∈ L(i), hence −α + (k − 1)δ ∈ N .
If (β ′ , β) > 0, we obtain as above that α − α′ > 0 ∈ ∆+ , and we are reduced to
the previous case. So we assume that (α′ , β) > 0. As above, α′ − β > 0, hence
there exists γ ∈ ∆+ such that α′ = β + γ and α = β ′ + γ. Hence we have that
−α′ +(k −1)δ = (−β +δ) +(−γ +(k −2)δ). By the induction assumption we obtain
that −γ + (k − 2)δ ∈ L(i), hence −α + (k − 1)δ = (−β ′ + δ) + (−γ + (k − 2)δ) ∈ L(i)
and therefore −α + (k − 1)δ ∈ N . The case (β ′ , α) > 0 is similar. 

For each β ∈ Ai , let xβ be any non zero element in gβ . Then {xβ | β ∈ Ai } is a
minimal set of generators of i as a b-module. Hence Proposition 3.4, together with
[CP2, Prop. 2.12, ii], imply the following result.

Corollary 3.5. For any i ∈ I, the minimal number of generators of i as a b-module
equals the number of right descents of wi and the cardinality of the antichain Ai .

   To proceed further, we need to recall one of the main results from [CP3]. Set
        D = {σ ∈ Q∨ | (σ, αi ) ≤ 1 for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and (σ, θ) ≥ −2} .
Set moreover
              Dab = {σ ∈ Q∨ | (σ, α) ∈ {0, 1, −1, −2} for each α ∈ ∆+ }.
It is clear that Dab ⊆ D. The first part of next statement is a result of [CP3],
generalizing the second one, which appears in [K2].

Proposition 3.6. [CP3, Prop. 3], [K2, Theorem 2.6] The map F : tτ v 7→ v −1 (τ )
is a bijection between W and D. Moreover, F restricts to a bijection between Wab
and Dab .
Set now, for 1 ≤ j ≤ ht(θ):
                                                                 	
                 Dj′ = σ ∈ Q∨ | −(j + 1) ≤ (σ, β) < j + 1 ∀ β ∈ ∆+ .

Set Di = Di′ ∩ D. Note that Dab = D1 = D1′ . Next lemma follows by standard
arguments (see [IM]); for the sake of completeness we include a proof.

Lemma 3.7. Assume i ∈ I and wi = tτ v, with τ ∈ Q∨ and v ∈ W . The following
conditions are equivalent:
      (i) wi (C1 ) ⊂ Cj+1 ;
     (ii) for each α ∈ ∆+ , 0 ≤ (τ, α) ≤ j+1; moreover, if (τ, α) = 0, then v −1 (α) > 0
          and if (τ, α) = j + 1, then v −1 (α) < 0.

Proof. Assume that (i) holds; then the hyperplanes Hα,0 , Hα,j+1 do not separate
C1 and wi (C1 ) for any α ∈ ∆+ . By direct computation, we obtain

     wi−1 (−α + (j + 1)δ) = v −1 t−τ (−α + (j + 1)δ) = −v −1 (α) + (j + 1 − (α, τ ))δ.

By 2.1, the above root should be positive, hence (α, τ ) ≤ j + 1, and, if equality
holds, then necessarily v −1 (α) < 0. Similarly, wi−1 (α) = v −1 (α) − (α, τ )δ > 0,
hence (α, τ ) ≥ 0, and v −1 (α) > 0 if (α, τ ) = 0. Hence (ii) holds. The converse is
similar. 


   For i ∈ I, let n(i) denote the nilpotence index of i ∈ I, i.e. the minimal n ∈ N+
such that in+1 = 0, where in is the nth term of the descending central series of i
(i1 = i).
Proposition 3.8. F induces by restriction bijections between {wi | i ∈ I, n(i) ≤ j}
and Dj .
Proof. By [CP2, Corollary 2.5] the ad-nilpotent ideal i of b has nilpotence index at
                                    / Li for any α ∈ ∆+ ; in turn, this condition is
most j if and only if −α + (j + 1)δ ∈
equivalent to
                                  wi (C1 ) ⊂ Cj+1
(this follows, e.g., by formulas 2.1). By Lemma 3.7, we assume that condition
3.7(ii) holds and consider (v −1 (τ ), β) for β ∈ ∆+ . We have either β = v −1 (α)
or β = −v −1 (α) for some α ∈ ∆+ . In the former case v −1 (α) > 0 and by our
assumption 0 ≤ (v −1 (τ ), β) = (τ, α) < j + 1; in the latter case v −1 (α) < 0, whence
−j − 1 ≤ (v −1 (τ ), β) = −(τ, α) < 0. In either cases we have −j − 1 ≤ (v −1 (τ ), β) <
j + 1. In a similar way we see that, conversely, if −j − 1 ≤ (v −1 (τ ), β) < j + 1, then
3.7(ii) holds. 

             §4 A characterization of maximal abelian ideals


   In this section we study maximal abelian ideals of b, obtaining a characterization
for them in terms of wi .
   We shall need the following easy remark.

4.1. If τ ∈ Q∨ is dominant, then either (τ, θ) = 0, or (τ, θ) ≥ 2. This is immediate
since 0 is the unique element in Q∨ ∩ C 1 .

                                                  b for some k ≥ 2, then
Lemma 4.2. Let i ∈ Iab and β ∈ ∆. If β + kδ ∈ wi (Π),
                    −1
β = −θ, k = 2, and wi (−θ + 2δ) ∈ Π.

Proof. Let β + kδ = wi (α), α ∈ Π.    b Then α 6∈ L −1 , hence ℓ(wi sα ) > ℓ(wi ) and
                                                       wi
by 2.7 N (wi sα ) = N (wi ) ∪ {wi (α)} = N (wi ) ∪ {β + kδ}. If β > 0, then by 2.3 (3)
we should obtain that β ∈ N (wi sα ), which is impossible since β ∈      / N (wi ); hence
β < 0. In particular, β + kδ ∈  / Π + Nδ, hence, by 3.3, no root in Π + Nδ belongs to
N (wi sα ). But it is clear that β + kδ is equal to −θ + 2δ plus a linear combination of
roots in Π + Nδ with integral non-negative coefficients; hence by 2.3 (3) we obtain
that −θ + 2δ ∈ N (wi sα ). Using 3.3 again, we obtain that −θ + 2δ = β + kδ. It
remains to prove that α 6= −θ+δ. Let wi = tτ v, τ ∈ Q∨ , v ∈ W . If by contradiction
α = −θ +δ, then v(θ) = θ and tτ v(−θ +δ) = −θ +(1+(θ, τ ))δ. Since τ is dominant,
by 4.1 we obtain that either tτ v(−θ + δ) = −θ + δ or tτ v(−θ + δ) = −θ + kδ with
k > 2. 


                                  b ⊆ ±(∆− + δ) ∪ Π ∪ {−θ + 2δ}.
Lemma 4.3. Let i ∈ Iab . Then wi (Π)

Proof. Let α ∈ Π.b If wi (α) < 0, then by 3.3 wi (α) ∈ ∆+ − δ. Assume wi (α) > 0,
so that, by 2.7, N (wi sα ) = N (wi ) ∪ {wi (α)}. If wi (α) = β + kδ with β ∈ ∆+ and
k ≥ 0, then by 2.3 (3) there exists some γ ∈ Π such that γ ∈ N (wi sα ), whence, by
3.3, γ = wi (α). Finally, if wi (α) = −β + kδ with β ∈ ∆+ and k > 0, then either
k = 1, or, by 4.2, β = θ and k = 2. 


                                                   b ∩ (∆− + δ) = ∅. In this
Theorem 4.4. i ∈ Iab is maximal if and only if wi (Π)
case −θ + 2δ ∈ wi (Πℓ ).

Proof. The abelian ideal i is maximal in Wab if and only if, for all w ∈ W c such that
wi ≤ w in the weak order, w 6∈ Wab . By 3.3, if u ∈ Wab and u′ ≤ u in the weak
order of W c , then u′ ∈ Wab as well. This implies that i is maximal in Iab if and only
                b such that wi (α) > 0, we have that wi sα 6∈ Wab . Since for wi (α) > 0
if, for all α ∈ Π
we have N (wi sα ) = N (wi ) ∪ {wi (α)}, this happens if and only if wi (α) 6∈ ∆− + δ.
This proves the first statement.
                b ∩ (∆− + δ) = ∅, we have in particular that wi is not the identity of
    Now if wi (Π)
c . Notice, moreover, that by 4.1 no translation may correspond to some non zero
W
abelian ideal. Hence if wi = tτ v, then v is not the identity; therefore v(α) < 0 for
at least one α ∈ Π. But by 4.3, tτ v(Π) b ⊆ ∆+ − δ ∪ Π ∪ {−θ + 2δ}, hence for such
an α, v(α) = −θ and wi (α) = −θ + 2δ. Moreover, since θ is long, α is long too. 
12                          PAOLA CELLINI PAOLO PAPI

4.5. Remark. If w ∈ Wab , and w = tτ v with τ ∈ Q∨ , v ∈ W , then w−1 (−θ +2δ) ∈
Πℓ if and only if v −1 (−θ) ∈ Πℓ . In fact, if v(α) = −θ, then by 4.1 we obtain that
either w(α) = −θ, or w(α) = −θ + 2δ, but by 4.3 the first case cannot occur.

   In 3.6 we recalled Kostant’s bijection between Iab and a certain subset Dab of
Q∨ . Theorem 4.4 translates into the following characterization of maximal abelian
ideals inside Dab .

Proposition 4.6. Let i ∈ Iab and let wi = tτ v, with τ ∈ Q∨ and v ∈ W . Then i
is maximal if and only if
    (1) (v −1 (τ ), αi ) 6= −1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n;
    (2) (v −1 (τ ), θ) 6= 0.

Proof. For all α ∈ ∆  b we have wi (α) = v(α) − (v(α), τ )δ; moreover, v(−θ + δ) =
                                                                                b ∩
−v(θ) + δ and (δ, τ ) = 0. Therefore by a direct computation we obtain that wi (Π)

                             §5 The structure of X

   As explained in the introduction, the set X = Q∨ ∩ C 2 plays a prominent role
in the description of the abelian ideals. In this section we provide a technical
characterization of X. Indeed we shall give an orthogonal decomposition of each
element of X as a sum of highest roots of nested irreducible parabolic subsystems
of ∆.
   We need preliminarily the analysis of which roots are dominant; this fact is
known to the experts, nevertheless we prefer to provide a proof (which is different
from the one given in [St1, Proposition 2.1]).
   It is clear that the highest root θ is dominant. Moreover, θ ∨ is a short root in
the dual system ∆∨ and is clearly dominant relatively to ∆∨ . Symmetrically, if
                                                           ∨
θ(∆∨ ) is the highest root of ∆∨ and we set θs = (θ(∆2θ(∆    )
                                                      ∨ ),θ(∆∨ )) , we obtain that θs

is a short dominant root in ∆. Therefore θ, θs are dominant; the converse is also
true.

Lemma 5.1. The unique dominant roots in ∆ are θ and θs .
Proof. Let α ∈ ∆ be a long dominant root. Then (α, β) ≥ 0 for all β ∈ ∆+ ;
indeed, since α is long, we have (β, α∨ ) ∈ {0, 1} for all β ∈ ∆+ . It follows that
β − α 6∈ ∆+ for all β ∈ ∆+ , otherwise (β − α, α∨ ) = (β, α∨ ) − (α, α∨ ) < 0, against
the assumption that α is dominant. Therefore α = θ. Now assume that α is a short
dominant root. Then α∨ is a long dominant root in ∆∨ , therefore α∨ = θ(∆∨ ) and
α = θs . 


Lemma 5.2. If τ ∈ Q is dominant and non zero then τ ≥ θs . Equivalently, if
τ ∈ Q∨ is dominant and non zero then τ ≥ θ ∨ .
Proof. It is well known that the fundamental weights are nonnegative linear com-
binations of Π, hence any dominant weight σ is a nonnegative linear combination
                ad-NILPOTENT IDEALS OF A BOREL SUBALGEBRA III                              13

of Π; it is also clear that Supp(σ) = Π. In particular, if σ ∈ −Q+ , then there
                                                            Pn
exists some α ∈ Π such that (σ, α) < 0. Indeed, if 0 6= σ =    λi αi with λi ≤ 0,
                                                                     i=1
then there exists an i such that λi < 0 and (σ, αi ) < 0. This is immediate, since
(αi , αj ) ≤ 0 for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, hence (σ, αj ) ≥ 0 for all j such that λj = 0.
     Now let τ ∈ Q be dominant and assume, by contradiction, that τ − θs 6∈ Q+ .
Then τ −θs is an integral linear combination of Π with some negative coefficient, say
             Ph             Pn
τ = θs − j=1 λj αij + j=h+1 λj αij , with {i1 , . . . , in } = [n], 1 ≤ h ≤ n, λj ∈ N
                                                     Ph                        Pn
and λj > 0 for some 1 ≤ j ≤ h. Set σ =                   j=1 λj αij , and υ =    j=h+1 λj αij
        ′      +
Let σ ∈ Q be a maximal element, with respect to the standard partial order,
such that σ ′ ≤ σ, and θs − σ ′ ∈ ∆. Set θs′ = θs − σ ′ and σ ′′ = σ − σ ′ , so that
τ = θs′ − σ ′′ + υ. By the above discussion, if σ ′′ 6= 0 then there exist some k ∈ [h]
such that σ ′′ > αik and (−σ ′′ , αik ) < 0. But it is clear that (υ, αik ) ≤ 0; moreover,
(θs′ , αik ) ≤ 0, otherwise θs′ − αik = θs − (σ ′ + αik ) ∈ ∆, and σ ′ + αik ≤ σ, against the
maximality of σ ′ . It follows that (τ, αik ) < 0, a contradiction. Hence τ = θs′ +υ. By
5.1, θs′ is not dominant, hence (θs′ , αi ) < 0 for some i ∈ [n]. Since θs′ = θs − σ ′ , θs is
dominant, and (−σ ′ , αij ) ≥ 0 for j ∈ [n] \[h], we obtain that (θs′ , αik ) < 0 for some
k ∈ [h]. But then (υ, αik ) ≤ 0, hence (τ, αik ) < 0, against the assumption. 


Notation. We set

              ∆θ = {α ∈ ∆ | (α, θ) = 0},          Π′θ = {α ∈ Π | (α, θ) 6= 0}.


Lemma 5.3.
   (1) ∆θ is the standard parabolic subsystem of ∆ generated by Π \Π′θ .
   (2) The longest element w0 of W preserves the irreducible components of ∆θ
       and acts on them as their longest element.
   (3) Let Γ be any irreducible component of ∆θ , θ(Γ) its highest root and α ∈ Π′θ .
       Then (α, θ(Γ)) < 0.

Proof.
(1) This is well known, since θ is dominant.
(2) Let w0θ be the longest element of W (∆θ ). Then w0θ is the commutative product of
the longest elements relative to each irreducible component of ∆θ , hence it preserves
∆θ componentwise and acts on each component as its longest element. Consider
sθ w0θ . For all α ∈ ∆+ we have sθ (α) = α − (α, θ ∨ )θ, hence sθ (α) < 0 if and only if
α 6⊥ θ; it follows that N (sθ ) = ∆+ \∆+ θ . Moreover, sθ fixes ∆θ pointwise, thus we
have N (sθ w0 ) = N (sθ ) + sθ N (w0 ) = (∆+ \∆+
               θ                   θ                        +
                                                  θ ) + sθ ∆θ = (∆    ∆θ ) + ∆ +
                                                                   +\ +              +
                                                                               θ = ∆ .
It follows that sθ w0θ = w0 , which clearly implies the claim.
(3) This follows from the fact that if α ∈ Π′θ , then α is connected to each component
of the Dynkin graph of Π \Π′θ . This implies that (α, β) ≤ 0 for all β ∈ Γ and
(α, β) < 0 for at least one β ∈ Γ ∩ Π. Since Supp(θ(Γ)) = Γ ∩ Π, we obtain
(α, θ(Γ)) < 0. 


Definition 5.4. Let
                                ∆ = ∆1 ⊃ ∆2 ⊃ . . . ⊃ ∆k

be a chain of standard parabolic irreducible subsystems of ∆ and set θi = θ(∆i ) for
i = 1, . . . , k. We shall say that ∆ = ∆1 ⊃ ∆2 ⊃ . . . ⊃ ∆k is a good chain if:
     (1) ∆i is an irreducible component of {α ∈ ∆i−1 | (α, θi−1 ) = 0}.
     (2) If α ∈ Π and (α, θi ) > 0, then α ⊥ ∆j for all j ≥ i + 2.
     (3) ∆i contains at least a long root.

Notation. For a good chain {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ ∆2 ⊃ . . . ⊃ ∆k } we set

                 θi = θ(∆i );   Πi = ∆i ∩ Π;    Π′i = {α ∈ Πi | (α, θi ) 6= 0},

for i = 1, . . . , k.
Lemma 5.5. Let {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ ∆2 ⊃ . . . ⊃ ∆k } be a good chain.
     (1) For i = 1, . . . , k, θi is a long root, in particular (θi∨ , β) ∈ {−1, 0, 1, 2}, for
         all β ∈ ∆+ and (θi∨ , β) = 2 if and only if β = θi .
     (2) We have (θi∨ , β) = 0 for all β ∈ ∆j with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k.
     (3) Let α ∈ Π. Then (θi∨ , α) = −1 if and only if α ∈ Π′i−1 , and (θi∨ , α) > 0 if
         and only if α ∈ Π′i .

Proof. The first statement follows from property (3) in Definition 5.4. The second
statement follows directly from the definitions, too. We prove (3). Assume α ∈ Π.
By Lemma 5.3 (3), if α ∈ Π′i−1 , we have (θi∨ , α) = −1. Moreover, it is clear that
(θi∨ , α) ∈ {1, 2} if α ∈ Π′i and that (θi∨ , α) = 0 if α ∈ Πi \Π′i , so it remains to prove
that (α, θi ) = 0 if α 6∈ Π′i−1 ∪ Πi . Assume α ∈ Πi−j \(Π′i−1 ∪ Πi ), with j ≥ 1. If
α ∈ Π′i−j , then j > 1 and we are done by property (2) of Definition 5.4. If α 6∈ Π′i−j ,
then α lies in a connected component of ∆θi−j . If such component is not ∆i−j+1 ,
then α ⊥ Πi−j+1 , hence (α, θi ) = 0, since θi ∈ ∆i−j+1 . If α ∈ Πi−j+1 , we conclude
by induction. 


     Set X + = X \{0}.

Proposition 5.6. Let {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k } be a good chain of root subsystems
                 P
                 k
of ∆ and set τ =   θi∨ . Then τ ∈ X + . Moreover, if α ∈ Π, we have (τ, α) 6= 0 if
                         i=1
and only if α ∈ Π′k .
   Conversely, for each τ ∈ X + there exists a good chain {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k }
              Pk
such that τ =    θi∨ .
                   i=1

               Pk                                                 Pk
Proof. Clearly      θi∨ ∈ Q∨ , so we only have to prove that          θi∨ ∈ C 2 . We have
 k           i=1                                                i=1
 P ∨                     P k
     θi , θ = (θ ∨ , θ)+ i=2 (θi∨ , θ) = 2 since, for i ≥ 2, θi ∈ ∆θ . Thus it remains to

               P
               k
prove that       θi∨ is dominant. Let α ∈ Π. By Lemma 5.5, (α, θi ) 6= 0 if and only if
             i=1
either α ∈ Π′i or α ∈ Π′i−1 . Set i∗ = max {i | α ∈ Πi }. Then α 6∈ Π′i for all i < i∗ and
                                              

                                            θi = 0. Assume α ∈ Π′i∗ . If i∗ < k, then

clearly α 6= θi∗ and by Lemma 5.5 we obtain α,             = (α, θi∨∗ ) + (α, θi∨∗ +1 ) =
                                                               θi∨
                                                i=1

                              k
1 − 1 = 0. If i∗ = k, then α,   θi∨ = (α, θi∨∗ ) ∈ {1, 2}.
                                   i=1
    Now we prove the converse statement. Assume τ ∈ X + . As remarked in 4.1 we
have (τ, θ) = 2 and, by Lemma 5.2, τ ≥ θ ∨ . If τ = θ ∨ we are done, so we assume
τ − θ ∨ 6= 0. We have (τ − θ ∨ , θ) = 0 and τ − θ ∨ ∈ (Q∨ )+ . Since θ is dominant, this
implies that all the simple coroots which support τ −θ ∨ must be perpendicular to θ,
so that, indeed, τ − θ ∨ ∈ Q∨ (∆θ ). It is clear that τ − θ ∨ is still dominant relatively
to ∆θ ; we claim that, moreover, Supp(τ − θ ∨ ) is included in a single irreducible
component of ∆θ . By Lemma 5.3 (3), for any irreducible component Γ of ∆θ
and α ∈ Π′θ we have (α, θ(Γ)∨ ) = −1. Let Γ1 , . . . , Γj be irreducible components
of ∆θ . Then τ − θ ∨ is a sum of dominant elements in Q∨ (Γ1 ), . . . , Q∨ (Γj ). If, by
contradiction, Supp(τ −θ ∨ ) has non-trivial intersection with two distinct irreducible
components, say Γ1 and Γ2 , of ∆θ , then, by Lemma 5.2, τ − θ ∨ ≥ θ(Γ1 )∨ + θ(Γ2 )∨ .
It follows that, for α ∈ Π′θ , we have (α, τ −θ ∨ ) ≤ −2, and therefore that (α, τ ) ≤ −1,
which is impossible. So there exists an irreducible component ∆2 of ∆ such that
τ − θ ∨ lies in Q∨ (∆2 ). By Lemma 5.2, τ − θ ∨ ≥ θ2∨ . By induction we can find
a chain of irreducible subsystems ∆ = ∆1 ⊃ ∆2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k , such that ∆i is an
                                              Pk
irreducible component of (∆i )θi and τ =           θi∨ .
                                                i=1
    It remains to prove that ∆ = ∆1 ⊃ ∆2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k satisfies conditions (2) and
(3) of Definition 5.4.
    First we prove (3). Assume by contradiction that ∆i consists entirely of short
roots, for some i in [k]. By a direct check we obtain that then ∆i has rank 1 and
                                                          ∨
∆i−1 is of type B3 or G2 ; in particular i = k. Now θk−1      + θk∨ must be dominant
for ∆k−1 , but this is not the case. In fact, θk is the short root of Πk−1 , while θk−1
is long. If α is the (unique) root in Π′k−1 , then α is long, thus (θk−1
                                                                       ∨
                                                                          , α) = 1 and
   ∨                      ∨       ∨
(θk , α) < −1, hence (θk−1 + θk , α) < 0.
    Finally we prove (2). Assume α ∈ Π′i . Clearly (α, θj ) = 0 for 1 ≤ j < i.
Moreover, as remarked above, we have (α, θi+1 ) < 0 and, since α 6∈ ∆j for j > i,
(α, θj ) ≤ 0 Pfor j ≥ i + 2. Since θi and
                                       P θi+1 are    long we obtain (τ, α) = (θi∨ , α) +
   ∨                    ∨                         ∨
(θi+1 , α) + j≥i+2 (θj , α) = 1 − 1 + j≥i+2 (θj , α). Since τ is dominant it follows
that (θj∨ , α) = 0 for all j ≥ i + 2. 


Remark 5.7. The proof of Theorem 5.6 makes clear the following facts.
   (1) Assume τ ∈ X + and τ = θ1∨ +· · ·+θk∨ , as in 5.6. Then (θ,θ)      2 τ = θ1 +· · ·+θk ,
              (θ,θ)
       and 2 (τ, τ ) = 2k.
   (2) Assume τ, τ̃ ∈ X + , τ = θ1∨ + · · · + θk∨ , and τ̃ = θ̃1∨ + · · · + θ̃k̃∨ as in Theorem
       5.6. Let h be the maximal index such that θh = θ̃h . Then θi = θ̃i for
       1 ≤ i ≤ h; moreover, θi ⊥ θ̃j for all i, j > h. It follows that (θ,θ)      2
                                                                                     (τ, τ̃) = 2h.
                                                                   +
       In particular the orthogonal decomposition of τ ∈ X provided by Theorem
       5.6 is unique.
   (3) Let α ∈ ∆+   ℓ . Then there exists a unique maximal good chain ∆ = {∆1 ⊃
       · · · ⊃ ∆k } such that α ∈ ∆i for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Moreover, if {∆ = ∆′1 ⊃ · · · ⊃
       ∆′h } is any good chain such that α ∈ ∆′h , then h ≤ k and ∆′i = ∆i for
       1 ≤ i ≤ h. This is easily seen by induction; indeed, if {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆i }
16                               PAOLA CELLINI PAOLO PAPI

         is a good chain such that α ∈ ∆i , then α belongs to at most one connected
         component of ∆i ∩ θi⊥ , hence there is at most one good chain {∆ = ∆1 ⊃
         · · · ⊃ ∆i+1 } which extends {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆i } and such that α ∈ ∆i+1 .

Examples.
∆ ∼= An . Set ∆i = hαi , . . . , α2n−i+1 i 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊ n+1
                                                      2 ⌋. Then the possible good
                                             n+1
chains are Sj = {∆1 , . . . , ∆j }, 1 ≤ j ≤ ⌊ 2 ⌋. The corresponding elements in X
are τj = ωj∨ + ωn−j+1
                ∨
                        (here ωi∨ denotes the ith fundamental coweight).
∆∼= E6 . Due to condition (2), there are only two good chains:

                              {∆},        {∆, hα1 , α3 , α4 , α5 , α6 i}.

Indeed X + = {θ ∨ , ω1∨ + ω6∨ }.
∆∼= B2n+1 . Due to conditions (2) and (3), there are the following good chains:

                            {∆},      {∆, hα3 , α4 , . . . , α2n+1 i}, . . .

          {∆, hα3 , α4 , . . . , α2n+1 i, . . . , hα2n−1 , α2n , . . . , α2n+1 i}, {∆, hα1 i}.



                                     §6 The posets Iab (τ )

   In this section we begin to study the poset of abelian ideals encoded by elements
   c of the form tτ v, for a fixed τ ∈ X and v varying in W . We prove that this
in W
poset has minimum, obtained for a special element tτ vτ which will be analysed in
detail. Then we introduce the posets Iab (α, τ ), which will be extensively studied in
the next section.

Notation. Let τ ∈ X + . According to Proposition 5.6, and Remark 5.7 (2) there
exists a unique good chain of irreducible subsystems {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k } such
that τ = θ1∨ + · · · + θk∨ , where θi is the highest root of ∆i . We shall call τ =
θ1∨ +· · ·+θk∨ the standard orthogonal decomposition of τ , and {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k }
the good chain of τ . Moreover we set

∆(τ ) = ∆k ,     Π(τ ) = Π ∩ ∆(τ ),        θ(τ ) = θk ,     Π′ (τ ) = {α ∈ Π(τ ) | (α, θ(τ )) 6= 0}.

We set ∆(0) = Π(0) = ∅. Then, by 5.6, given α ∈ Π we have (α, τ ) 6= 0 if and only
if α ∈ Π′ (τ ).

     We set, for τ ∈ X,

                          Wab (τ ) = {w ∈ Wab | w = tτ v, v ∈ W },

                               Iab (τ ) = {i ∈ Iab | wi ∈ Wab (τ )}.

6.1. Let w ∈ W   c . By Proposition 3.1 (2), w ∈ Wab if and only if w(C1 ) ⊂
C2 . Let x ∈ C1 , and w = tτ v, with τ ∈ Q∨ and v ∈ W . Then w(x) ∈ C2
if and only if (tτ v(x), β) > 0 for all β ∈ Π, and (tτ v(x), θ) < 2. Equivalently,
                  ad-NILPOTENT IDEALS OF A BOREL SUBALGEBRA III                       17

 w(x) ∈ C2 if and only if 0 < (tτ v(x), β) < 2 for all β ∈ ∆+ . For β ∈ ∆ have
 (tτ v(x), β) = (τ + v(x), β) = (τ, β) + (x, v −1 (β)); moreover 0 < |(x, v −1 (β))| < 1
 and (x, v −1 (β)) > 0 if and only if v −1 (β) > 0. Set

                                   ∆iτ = {α ∈ ∆ | (α, τ ) = i}.

 Then we obtain:

(1) tτ v ∈ Wab if and only if the following conditions hold: τ ∈ X; for all β ∈ ∆0τ ∩∆+ ,
    v −1 (β) > 0; for all β ∈ ∆2τ , v −1 (β) < 0.

   By 4.1, for τ ∈ X we have (τ, θ) = 2 unless τ = 0. In this case, by 3.1 (2),
                                                                  c . So we have,
 we have that tτ v ∈ Wab if and only if tτ v = 1, the identity of W
 equivalently,

(2) tτ v ∈ Wab if and only if the following conditions hold: τ ∈ X; for all β ∈ Π, if
    (τ, β) = 0, then v −1 (β) > 0; if tτ v 6= 1, then v −1 (θ) < 0.

    Using Theorem 5.6, we also obtain:

(3) tτ v ∈ Wab if and only if τ ∈ X, Lv ⊆ Π′ (τ ), and, if tτ v 6= 1, θ ∈ N (v).

   Moreover, by Proposition 3.3, w ∈ Wab if and only if N (w) ⊆ ∆− + δ. We have
 w−1 (−β +δ) = v −1 t−τ (−β +δ) = v −1 (−β +(1−(τ, β))δ) = v −1 (−β)+(1−(τ, β))δ.
 Hence w−1 (−β + δ) < 0 if and only if (τ, β) > 1 or (τ, β) = 1 and v −1 (β) > 0.
 Thus if w ∈ Wab , since (τ, β) ≤ 2 for all τ ∈ X and β ∈ ∆+ , we obtain (cfr.[CMP,
 Lemma C]):

(4) N (tτ v) = {−β + δ | β ∈ ∆2τ ∪ (∆1τ \N (v))},

    hence:

(5) gβ ⊆ i(tτ v) if and only if β ∈ ∆2τ ∪ (∆1τ \N (v)).

    By (1), if w ∈ Wab , then ∆2τ ⊆ N (v). Therefore by (5), if tτ v and tτ v ′ belong to
 Wab (τ ∈ X, v, v ′ ∈ W ), then the inclusion of the corresponding ideals corresponds
 to the reverse weak order of v, v ′ :

(6) i(tτ v) ⊆ i(tτ v ′ ) if and only if v ′ ≤ v.

    Consider
                               ∆even
                                τ    = {α ∈ ∆ | (α, τ ) is even}.
 It is clear that for τ ∈ X

(7) ∆2τ = (∆even
            τ
                 \
                   ∆0τ ) ∩ ∆+ .

   We remark that ∆0τ is the parabolic standard subsystem of ∆  b generated by
  \ ′                                        even
 Π Π (τ ), and, by [CMP, Lemma 2.6 (2)], ∆τ       is isomorphic to the standard

Proposition 6.2. Let w ∈ Wab , τ ∈ X + , and let τ = θ1∨ + · · · + θk∨ be the standard
orthogonal decomposition of τ . Then i(w) ∈ Iab (τ ) if and only if −θi + δ ∈ N (w)
for all i ∈ {1, . . . , k} and −β + δ 6∈ N (w) for all β ∈ ∆k ∩ θk⊥ .
Proof. Assume w = tτ v with v ∈ W . Since (τ, θi) = 2 for all i ∈ {1, . . . , k}, by 6.1
(4) we have that w−1 (−θi + δ) < 0, for all i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. Moreover, if β ∈ ∆k ∩ θk⊥ ,
we have (τ, β) = 0, hence by 6.1 (4) −β + δ 6∈ N (w). Conversely, let w = tτ̃ v
with τ̃ 6= τ and τ̃ = θ̃1∨ + · · · + θ̃k̃∨ be the standard orthogonal decomposition of
τ̃ . Let h ∈ {1, . . . , min {k, k̃}} be the maximal index such that θh = θ̃h . Then, by
Remark 5.7 (2) at least one of k, k̃ is strictly greater than h. Moreover, if h < k,
then θh+1 ⊥ τ̃ hence, by 6.1 (4), −θh+1 + δ 6∈ N (w). If h = k, then we have that
θ̃h+1 ∈ ∆k ∩ θk⊥ and −θ̃h+1 + δ ∈ N (w). 


  As recalled in 2.9, for each I ⊆ Π there is a unique v ∈ W with Lv ⊆ I of
maximal length, and maximal, indeed, with respect to the weak order: just take
v = w0I w0 , where w0I is the longest element in hsα | α 6∈ Ii. Then N (v) = ∆+ \∆I ,
where ∆I is the subsystem of ∆ generated by Π \I.

Notation. We fix τ ∈ X and set

                          vτ = w0I w0 ,     with     I = Π′ (τ ).


     By 6.1 (3) tτ vτ ∈ Wab . Moreover we have the following result.

Proposition 6.3.
  (1) i(tτ vτ ) = min Iab (τ );
  (2) dim i(tτ vτ ) = 12 (|∆even
                            τ    | − |∆0τ |).

Proof. (1) From 6.1 (6) we directly obtain that i(tτ vτ ) is minimal in Iab (τ ).
(2) We have N (vτ ) = ∆+ \∆I = ∆+ \∆0τ = ∆2τ ∪ ∆1τ , hence, by 6.1 (5), i(tτ vτ ) =
  ⊕ gα . In particular dim i(tτ vτ ) = |∆2τ |, and by 6.1 (7) we obtain formula (2). 
α∈∆2τ



Lemma 6.4. The element vτ is an involution.
Proof. We have, for any I ⊆ Π, that (w0I w0 )−1 = w0J w0 with J = −w0 (I). So, in
our case, we have to prove that −w0 (I) = I, for I = Π′ (τ ). By Lemma 5.3 (2) w0
preserves all irreducible components of ∆θ and acts on them as their longest ele-
ment. Since the longest element maps the highest root to its opposite, by recursion
we obtain that −w0 fixes τ , for each τ ∈ X, and therefore stabilizes Π′ (τ ). 


Lemma 6.5. Let I ⊆ Π, v = w0I w0 , and y ∈ W . If v is an involution, then Lvy ⊆ I
if and only if Ly ⊆ I. In this case −vN (y) ⊆ N (v) and N (vy) = N (v) \ − vN (y).
In particular l(vy) = l(v) − l(y).
Proof. For any u ∈ W we have Lu ⊆ I if and only if N (u) ⊆ ∆ \∆I , where ∆I is the
subsystem of ∆ generated by Π \I. Recall that N (vy) = N (v) + vN (y). If Ly 6⊆ I,
let α ∈ Ly \I. Then α ∈ N (y), whence v(α) ∈ vN (y), but v(α) = v −1 (α) > 0,
                ad-NILPOTENT IDEALS OF A BOREL SUBALGEBRA III                               19

hence v(α) 6∈ N (v); therefore v(α) ∈ N (vy). Since N (v) = ∆ \∆I , we obtain that
N (vy) 6⊆ ∆ \∆I , hence Lvy 6⊆ I. Conversely, if N (y) ⊆ ∆ \∆I , then vN (y) =
v −1 N (y) < 0. By 2.7, it follows that N (vy) ⊆ N (v), hence Lvy ⊆ Lv . Moreover,
−v(N (y)) ⊆ N (v) and l(vy) = l(v) − l(y). 


Proposition 6.6. Assume τ ∈ X, v, v ′ ∈ W . Then tτ v ∈ Wab if and only if
v = vτ y with Ly ⊆ Π′ (τ ).
   Assume tτ v, tτ v ′ ∈ Wab , v = vτ y, and v ′ = vτ y ′ . Then i(tτ v) ⊆ i(tτ v ′ ) if and
only if N (y) ⊆ N (y ′ ).
Proof. The first assertion follows directly from 6.1 (3), 6.4, and 6.5.
   Under the assumptions of the second assertion, by 6.5 we have −vτ N (y) ⊆
N (vτ ), −vτ N (y ′ ) ⊆ N (vτ ), N (vτ y) = N (vτ ) \ − vτ N (y), and N (vτ y ′ ) = N (vτ ) \ −
vτ N (y ′ ). Therefore, v ′ ≤ v if and only if y ≤ y ′ . This proves the claim. 


   It is clear that the arguments of section 4 can be specialized to Iab (τ ). We obtain
the following result.

Proposition 6.7. Let i ∈ Iab (τ ). Then i is maximal in Iab (τ ) if and only if
wi (Π) ∩ (∆− + δ) = ∅. In this case, if τ 6= 0, we have wi−1 (−θ + 2δ) ∈ Π, hence if
wi = tτ v, then v −1 (−θ) ∈ Πℓ .
Proof. We notice that if j ∈ Iab (τ ), then wj = wi x with x ∈ W . So, we can just
                                                  b 
mimic the proof of 4.4 considering Π in place of Π.


  The above result leads us to analyse v −1 (θ) for all v ∈ W such that tτ v ∈ Iab (τ ).
We first study what vτ (θ) is.

  For any root β and any simple root α let nα (β) denote the coefficient of α in β
and set mα = nα (θ):
                                X                        X
                           β=         nα (β)α,     θ=         mα α.
                                α∈Π                     α∈Π



Proposition 6.8. Fix τ ∈ X + .
    (1) We have vτ (Π \Π′ (τ )) = Π \Π′ (τ ).
    (2) Set Bτ = vτ (Π′ (τ )). For each β ∈ Bτ , there exists a unique α ∈ Π′ (τ ) such
        that nα (β) 6= 0 and, for such an α, we have nα (β) = −1. In particular
        B τ ⊆ ∆− .
    (3) Let β ∈ Bτ and α ∈ Π′ (τ ) such that nα (β) = −1. Then −β is the maximal
        element in {γ ∈ ∆+ | Supp(γ) ∩ Π′ (τ ) = {α}, nα (γ) = 1}, with respect to
        the standard partial order of Q.
    (4) We have vτ (θ) = −θ(τ ). Moreover, nα (θ(τ )) = mα for all α ∈ Π′ (τ ) and
        θ(τ ) is the minimal root with this property, with respect to the standard
        partial order of Q.
20                              PAOLA CELLINI PAOLO PAPI

Proof.
(1) The claim follows since vτ maps Π \Π′ (τ ) to −w0 (Π \Π′ (τ )), which is equal to
Π \Π′ (τ ), as seen in the proof of Lemma 6.4.
(2) Recall that vτ = vτ−1 ; thus Bτ = vτ (Π′ (τ )) is a set of negative roots. By (1) vτ
preserves Π \Π′ (τ ), and since vτ (Π) is a basis of ∆, we obtain that Bτ ∪ (Π \Π′ (τ ))
is a basis of ∆. In particular, each α ∈ Π′ (τ ), is a nonnegative or nonpositive linear
combination of Bτ ∪ (Π \Π′ (τ )). This implies that for each α ∈ Π′ (τ ), some β ∈ Bτ
is supported by α and, moreover, α has coefficient −1 in such a β. Moreover, each
β ∈ Bτ is supported by a unique α ∈ Π′ (τ ).
(3) Let α ∈ Π′ (τ ) and βα be the unique root in Bτ supported by α. If γ ∈ ∆+ ,
Supp(γ) ∩ Π′ (τ ) = {α}, and nα (γ) = 1 then, arguing as in (2) we find that γ equals
−βα minus a sum of roots in Π \Π′ (τ ). This proves the claim.
                        P
(4) We have vτ (θ) = α∈Π mα vτ (α). For each α ∈ Π′ (τ ), set γα = vτ (α), and let
α′ be the unique root of Π′ (τ ) which supports γα . Then, by (2), nα′ (vτ (θ)) = −mα ,
hence mα ≤ mα′ . Moreover {α′ | α ∈ Π       ′           ′                       ′
                                           P(τ )} = Π (τ ),Phence {mα | α ∈ Π (τ )} =
                                                                        ′
                 ′
{mα | α ∈ Π (τ )}. It follows that              mα =            mα′ , hence mα = mα′ .
                                            α∈Π′ (τ )        α∈Π′ (τ )
                    ′
Thus each α ∈ Π (τ ) occurs in −vτ (θ) with coefficient mα . We show that −v(θτ )
is the minimal root with this property. As seen in (1), vτ permutes Π \Π′ (τ ); since
θ + η is not a root for each η ∈ Q+ , we obtain that vτ (θ) + η is not a root for all
η ∈ Q+ (Π \Π′ (τ )). Equivalently −vτ (θ) − η is not a root for all η ∈ Q+ (Π \Π′ (τ )),
hence −vτ (θ) is minimal among the roots in which α occurs with coefficient mα for
all α ∈ Π′ (τ ). Now we know from the orthogonal decomposition of τ = θ1∨ +· · ·+θk∨
that (τ, θi) = 2 for i = 1, . . . , k. Since nα (θi ) ≤ nα (θ1 ) = mα for all α ∈ Π′ (τ ) and
since Π′ (τ ) is the set of all simple roots non orthogonal to τ , we obtain nα (θi ) = mα
for i = 1, . . . , k. In particular we obtain that −vτ (θ) ≤ θ(τ ). But Π′ (τ ) is the set
of all simple roots which belong to ∆(τ ) and are not orthogonal to θ(τ ), hence
we have (−vτ (θ), θ ∨(τ )) = (θ(τ ), θ ∨ (τ )) = 2. Since θ(τ ) is long this implies that
−vτ (θ) = θ(τ ). 


Lemma 6.9. Let α ∈ ∆+
                    ℓ , v ∈ W and assume that α ∈
                                                / ∆(τ ) and v(α) = θ(τ ).
Then Lv 6⊆ Π′ (τ ).

Proof. By 2.3 (5), Lv 6⊆ Π′ (τ ), if and only if there exists some γ ∈ N (v) such
that Supp(γ) ∩ Π′ (τ ) = ∅. We shall find such a γ. Since α 6∈ ∆(τ ), we have
that v ∈   / W (∆(τ )), hence N (v) 6⊆ ∆(τ ). By 2.8, N (v) ∩ ∆(τ ) = N (v ′ ) for some
v ∈ W (∆(τ )), hence there exists v ′′ ∈ W such that v = v ′ v ′′ , and v ′ N (v ′′ ) =
 ′

N (v) \∆(τ ). Set N (v ′′ ) = {β1 , . . . , βh }, and γi = v ′ (βi ), for i = 1, . . . , h, so that
N (v) \∆(τ ) = {γ1 , . . . , γh }. By 2.4 (1), we may assume that v = sγh · · · sγ1 v ′ . Con-
ditions α ∈    / ∆(τ ) and v ′ ∈ W (∆(τ )) imply v ′ (α) 6= θ(τ ), hence sγh · · · sγ1 (θ(τ )) 6=
θ(τ ). This implies that there exists i ∈ {1, . . . , h} such that γi 6⊥ θ(τ ). Since
θ(τ ) ∈  / N (v), we have that θ(τ ) 6= γi , hence (γi , θ ∨ (τ )) = ±1. Assume first
(γi , θ ∨ (τ )) = −1, so that γi + θ(τ ) ∈ ∆+ . By 6.8 (4), for any β ∈ Π′ (τ ) we
have that nβ (θ(τ )) = mβ , hence that nβ (γi ) = 0, and we are done. So assume
(γi , θ ∨ (τ )) = 1, so that γi − θ(τ ) ∈ ∆. Since γi ∈   / ∆(τ ), we have that γi 6< θ(τ ),
                         ′               ′       +
hence γi = θ(τ ) + γi , for some γi ∈ ∆ . Since γi ∈ N (v), and θ(τ ) ∈                / N (v), by
2.3 (3) we obtain that γi′ ∈ N (v). But (γi′ , θ ∨ (τ )) = −1, so we are reduced to the
previous case. 

  For τ ∈ X and α ∈ ∆+

                     Wab (τ, α) = {w ∈ Wab (τ ) | w(α) = −θ + 2δ};

                              Iab (τ, α) = {i ∈ Iab | wi ∈ Wab (τ, α)}.

Let α ∈ ∆+ℓ and w ∈ Wab be such that w(α) = −θ + 2δ. Then, if w = tτ v with
      ∨
τ ∈ Q and v ∈ W , we have v(α) = −θ. Conversely, if v(α) = −θ, then v 6= 1,
hence by 3.1 (2) τ 6= 0. By 4.1 it follows that (τ, θ ∨) = 2, hence tτ v(α) = tτ (−θ) =

using 6.4, and 6.8 (4), y(α) = vτ−1 v(α) = vτ (−θ) = θ(τ ). By 6.9, this implies that

                                      §7 The posets Iab (τ, α)

  In this section we prove that, for α ∈ ∆+  ℓ , Iab (τ, α) is not empty if and only if
α ∈ ∆(τ ), and in this case Iab (τ, α) has a unique minimal element and a unique
maximal element.

Proposition 7.1. Let α be any long root. Then:
     (1) {v ∈ W | v(α) = θ} has a unique element yα of minimal length.
     (2) Lyα ⊆ Π′θ ; conversely, if v ′ ∈ W , v ′ (α) = θ, and Lv ⊆ Π′θ , then v ′ = yα .
     (3) If α ∈ Πℓ , then ℓ(yα ) = g − 2;
     (4) yα−1 is the unique minimal element, with respect to the weak order, in
         {v ∈ W | v(θ) = α};
     (5) N (yα−1 ) = {β ∈ ∆+ | (β, α∨ ) = −1}.

Proof.
(1), (4). We start with proving that there exists a unique minimal element, with
respect to the weak order, in {v ∈ W | v(θ) = α}. This will imply (1) and (4). Let
m = min {ℓ(v) | v(θ) = α} and let v ∈ W be any element such that v(θ) = α and
       v∈W
ℓ(v) = m. Let v ′ ∈ W be such that v ′ (θ) = α. Then v ′ = vx with x ∈ StabW (θ).
We shall prove that ℓ(v ′ ) = ℓ(v) + ℓ(x): by 2.6, this implies in particular that
N (v) ⊆ N (v ′ ). Let v = si1 · · · sik , x = sj1 · · · sjh be reduced expressions. If by
contradiction si1 · · · sik sj1 · · · sjh is not reduced, then there exist u <B v, y <B x,
<B being the Bruhat order, such that uy = vx. But StabW (θ) = W (∆θ ) = hsβ |
β ∈ Π \Π′θ i, therefore, since x ∈ StabW (θ), we have y ∈ StabW (θ), too. It follows
that u(α) = θ, against the assumption that ℓ(v) is minimal. We set yα = v −1 ; then
it is clear that yα is the unique element of minimal length in W which maps α to
θ.
(2) For all y ∈ W , if y(α) = θ, then y = xyα with x ∈ StabW (θ) and ℓ(y) =
ℓ(x) + ℓ(yα ). In particular, ℓ(sβ yα ) > ℓ(yα ) for all β ∈ Π \Π′θ , hence Lyα ⊆ Π′θ .
Moreover, Lx ⊆ Π \Π′θ and N (x) ⊆ N (y), hence, if y 6= yα , Ly 6⊆ Π′θ .
(5) Assume yα (β) < 0. Then α 6= β and −yα (β) ∈ N (yα ). By item (2),
Supp(−yα (β)) ∩ Π′θ 6= ∅, hence (β, α∨ ) = −(−yα (β), θ ∨ ) = −1. Conversely, as-
sume (β, α∨ ) = −1. Then (yα (β), θ ∨ ) = −1, hence yα (β) < 0.
(3) Now we assume α ∈ Π and prove that m = g −2. Let α ∈ Πℓ and v ∈ W be such
that v(α) = θ. We first show that ℓ(v) ≥ g − 2. Let v = sγ1 · · · sγk be a reduced
                                            Qh
expression. Set v0 = 1, and vh = i=1 sγi , for 1 ≤ h ≤ k. Since N (vh ) ⊆ N (v),
vh−1 (θ) is a long positive root for 0 ≤ h ≤ k; in particular, vh−1     −1
                                                                             (θ) 6= γh , for 0 < h ≤
k. For any positive root β and any γ ∈ Π, we have sγ (β) = β − (β, γ ∨ )γ. Moreover,              
                                            ∨                              ∨        ∨       (β,β) 
if β is long and β 6= γ, then |(β , γ)| ≤ 1, hence |(β, γ )| = (β , γ) (γ,γ)  ≤
                  
 (β,β)      (θ,θ) 
 (γ,γ)  =  (γ,γ) . Therefore vh−1  −1
                                           (θ) − vh−1 (θ) ≤ (γ(θ,θ)
                                                               h ,γh )
                                                                       γh , for 1 ≤ h ≤ k, hence
                                   P
                                   k

θ − α = v0−1 (θ) − vk−1 (θ) ≤           (γi ,γi ) γi .   Since θ =         mγ γ =         m∨
                                                                                           γ (γ,γ) γ, we
                                  i=1                                γ∈Π            γ∈Π

obtain that each γ 6= α occurs in the sequence (γ1 , . . . ,P              γ times, and
             ∨                                                    ∨
α at least mα − 1 times. It follows that ℓ(v) = k ≥             mγ − 1 = g − 2. Next,
                                                                      γ∈Π
we show that there exists a w ∈ W such that w(α) = θ and ℓ(w) ≤ g − 2. If β
is a long root and β 6= θ, then there exists a simple root γ such that (β, γ ∨ ) < 0
                                  (θ,θ)
and hence sγ (β) = β + (γ,γ)            γ. Therefore, if α is a simple long root, we can
find a sequence of simple roots (γ1 , . . . , γk ) such that (sγi−1 · · · sγ1 (α), γi∨ ) < 0,
sγi · · · sγ1 (α) = sγi−1 · · · sγ1 (α) + (γ(θ,θ)
                                             i ,γi )
                                                     γi , for i ≤ k, and sγk · · · sγ1 (α) = θ. Then
                 P ∨
clearly k =         mγ − 1 = g − 2 and therefore ℓ(sγk · · · sγ1 ) ≤ g − 2. This concludes
              γ∈Π
the proof. 

Proposition 7.2. Let α ∈ ∆+      ℓ . Then for any pair β1 , β2 in ∆
                                                                        +
                                                                          such that θ =
β1 + β2 , at most one of β1 , β2 lies in N (yα ); moreover if β ⊥ θ, then β 6∈ N (yα ).
   If α is simple, exactly one of β1 , β2 lies in N (yα ); in particular

                                      1
                             g−2 =      (|∆| − |∆θ | − 2).
                                      4

Conversely, assume that y ∈ W is such that for any pair β1 , β2 in ∆+ such that
θ = β1 + β2 , exactly one of β1 , β2 lies in N (y), and, moreover, θ 6∈ N (y). Then
there exists α ∈ Πℓ such that y(α) = θ.
Proof. We have θ ∈   / N (yα ), therefore, by 2.3 (3), for any pair β1 , β2 in ∆+ such
that θ = β1 + β2 , at most one of β1 , β2 lies in N (yα ). Moreover, by 7.1 (2) and
2.3 (5), no root orthogonal to θ may belong to N (yα ). If α ∈ Π, since yα (α) > 0,
we have N (yα sα ) = N (yα ) ∪ {θ}; therefore at least one of β1 , β2 lies in N (yα sα )
and hence in N (yα ). By 7.1 (2) we have that, moreover, no root in ∆θ belongs
to N (yα ), therefore, using 7.1 (3), we obtain g − 2 = ℓ(yα ) = 12 (|∆+ \∆+  θ | − 1) =
1
4
  (|∆| − |∆θ | − 2).
    Now let y ∈ W be such that for any pair β1 , β2 in ∆+ such that θ = β1 + β2 ,
exactly one of β1 , β2 lies in N (y), and, moreover, θ 6∈ N (y). Then N (y) ∪ {θ} still
verifies conditions (a) and (b) of 2.3 (4), therefore there exists y ′ ∈ W such that
N (y ′ ) = N (y) ∪ {θ}. By 2.6, y ′ = yx with ℓ(y ′ ) = ℓ(y) + ℓ(x), therefore ℓ(x) = 1;
equivalently, x = sα for some α ∈ Π. Then by 2.4 we obtain that θ = y(α), hence
that α ∈ Πℓ . 


Notation. For α ∈ ∆+
                   ℓ , we set w̌α = s0 yα . Recall that yα sα = sθ yα and tθ = s0 sθ ,
                                                                            ∨

therefore we have
                            w̌α = s0 yα = tθ∨ yα sα .

Proposition 7.3. Let α ∈ ∆+
                          ℓ .
   (1) We have Iab (θ ∨ , α) = {i(w̌α )}.
   (2) For any pair β1 , β2 in ∆+ such that θ = β1 + β2 , at most one of −β1 +
       δ, −β2 + δ lies in N (w̌α ), and if α ∈ Π exactly one. Moreover, α0 ∈ N (w̌α ),
       and β 6∈ N (w̌α ) for all β ∈ ∆b + ∩ α⊥ .
                                              0
   (3) N (w̌α−1 ) = {β ∈ ∆+ | (β, α) = −1} ∪ {−α + δ}.

Proof.
    (1) follows from 6.1 (3) and 7.1 (2).
    (2) If θ = β1 + β2 with β1 , β2 ∈ ∆+ , then (βi , θ ∨ ) = 1 for i = 1, 2, so that
s0 (β1 ) = −β2 + δ and s0 (β2 ) = −β1 + δ. Since N (w̌α ) = N (s0 ) + s0 N (yα ), we get
the claim by Proposition 7.2.
    (3) follows from 7.1 (5), since N (w̌α−1 ) = N (yα−1 ) ∪ yα−1 N (s0 ). 

                                                                          S
Remark. It is clear that for all τ ∈ X + we have that Iab (τ ) =               Iab (τ, α).
                                                                        α∈∆+

  We can apply Proposition 7.1, in particular, to the irreducible parabolic subsys-
tems ∆(τ ), τ ∈ X + . We set

                                    Πℓ (τ ) = Πℓ ∩ Π(τ )
                                    ∆+         +
                                     ℓ (τ ) = ∆ℓ ∩ ∆(τ ).

For α ∈ Πℓ (τ ) we denote by yτ,α be the unique element of minimal length in
W (∆(τ )) such that yτ,α (α) = θ(τ ).

Proposition 7.4. Let τ ∈ X + and α ∈ ∆+        ℓ (τ ). Then tτ vτ yτ,α ∈ Wab (τ, α). In
particular, Iab (τ, α) is not empty if and only if α ∈ ∆+ℓ (τ ).

Proof. The “only if ” part was stated in 6.10. Conversely, if α ∈ ∆+        ℓ (τ ), then
yτ,α (α) = θ(τ ) and Lyτ,α ⊆ Π′ (τ ). Moreover, since vτ yτ,α (α) = −θ, we have
θ ∈ N (vτ yτ,α ). By Lemma 6.5 and 6.1 (3), it follows that tτ vτ yτ,α ∈ Iab (τ, α). 

Remark. The element yα defined in Proposition 7.1 equals yθ∨ ,α , in the above
notation. Comparing Propositions 7.3 (1) and 7.4 we obtain that, indeed, vθ∨ yα =
yα s α .

Proposition 7.5. Let τ ∈ X + , α ∈ ∆+ ℓ (τ ), and y ∈ W be such that y(α) = θ(τ )
and Ly ⊆ Π (τ ). Then yτ,α ≤ y and yτ,α y ∈ W (Π ∩ α⊥ ). In particular
          ′                         −1


                                i(tτ vτ yτ,α ) = min Iab (τ, α).

Proof. By 2.8, there exists y ′ ∈ W (∆(τ )) such that N (y ′ ) = N (y) ∩ ∆(τ ) and
                                                        −1
y = y ′ x with ℓ(y) = ℓ(y ′ ) + ℓ(x). Set α′ = y ′ (θ(τ )). Clearly α′ ∈ ∆+ (τ ), and
                                                                                    −1
since Ly′ ⊆ Π′ (τ ), by 7.1 (2) we obtain that y ′ = yτ,α′ . Then x = yτ,α             ′ y; hence

y = yτ,α′ x and N (y) = N (yτ,α′ ) ∪ yτ,α′ N (x). We prove that x is a product of
reflections with respect to simple roots orthogonal to α′ . Let x = x1 · · · xk with
xi simple reflection for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Assume by contradiction that xj = sβ with
β 6⊥ α′ for some j ∈ {1, . . . , k}, and xi (α′ ) = α′ for i < j. Set x′ = x1 · · · xj−1 ,
and y ′ = yτ,α′ x′ . Then y ′ (β) ∈ N (y) \N (yτ,α′ ), hence y ′ (β) ∈   / ∆(τ ); in particular
y (β) 6≤ θ(τ ). We have y (α ) = θ(τ ) and, since (β, α ) 6= 0, (y ′ (β), θ(τ )) 6= 0, hence
 ′                             ′  ′                          ′

either y ′ (β) −θ(τ ), or y ′ (β) +θ(τ ) is a root. In the second case, by 6.8 (4) we obtain
that nγ (y ′ (β)) = 0 for all γ ∈ Π′ (τ ): this is impossible, since y ′ (β) ∈ N (y) and
Ly ⊆ Π′ (τ ). In the first case, since y ′ (β) 6≤ θ(τ ), we obtain that y ′ (β) − θ(τ ) > 0;
moreover, since y ′ (β) ∈ N (y) and θ(τ ) ∈     / N (y), by 2.3 (3) y ′ (β) − θ(τ ) ∈ N (y). As
above this leads to a contradiction, since nγ (y ′ (β) − θ(τ )) = 0 for all γ ∈ Π′ (τ ).
Thus we have in particular that x(α′ ) = α′ , hence y(α′ ) = θ(τ ); it follows that
α′ = α. By Proposition 6.6 we obtain that i(tτ vτ yτ,α ) = min Iab (τ, α). 

Lemma 7.6. Let τ ∈ X + , α ∈ ∆+     ℓ (τ ), and y ∈ W be such that y(α) = θ(τ ) and
      ′                −1
Ly ⊆ Π (τ ). Set x = yτ,α y. Then x ∈ Wα and Lx ⊆ Pτ,α .
  Conversely, if x ∈ Wα and Lx ⊆ Pτ,α , then yτ,α x(α) = θ(τ ) and Lyτ,α x ⊆ Π′ (τ ).
Moreover, ℓ(yτ,α x) = ℓ(yτ,α ) + ℓ(x).
Proof. By Proposition 7.5, we have that x ∈ Wα , hence N (x) ⊆ ∆(Π ∩ α⊥ );
moreover N (y) = N (yτ,α ) ∪ yτ,α N (x). Therefore it suffices to prove that for all
β ∈ Π ∩ α⊥ \Pτ,α we have that β 6∈ N (x). Assume β ∈ Π ∩ α⊥ \Pτ,α ; this means
that either β ∈ Π(τ ), or β 6∈ Π(τ ) and β ⊥ ∆(τ ). First assume β 6∈ Π(τ ) and β ⊥
∆(τ ). Then, since yτ,α ∈ W (∆(τ )), we obtain that yτ,α (β) = β. By assumption,
β 6∈ N (y), hence β 6∈ N (x). Next assume β ∈ Π(τ ). Then yτ,α (β) ∈ ∆(τ ) and,
since β ⊥ α, yτ,α (β) ⊥ θ(τ ). It follows that Supp(yτ,α (β)) ∩ Π′ (τ ) = ∅; therefore
yτ,α (β) 6∈ N (y), whence β 6∈ N (x).
   Conversely, let x ∈ Wα be such that Lx ⊆ Pτ,α . It is clear that yτ,α x(α) = θ(τ ).
We use 2.3 (5): since N (yτ,α ) ⊆ Π′ (τ ), it suffices to prove that, for all β ∈ N (x),
Supp(yτ,α (β)) ∩ Π′ (τ ) 6= ∅, and yτ,α (β) > 0. By assumption, for each β ∈ N (x),
Supp(β) ∩ Pτ,α 6= ∅. Since yτ,α ∈ W (∆(τ )), yτ,α acts on any root by summing
linear combinations of roots in Π(τ ). Since P (τ, α) ∩ Π(τ ) = ∅, we obtain that
Supp(yτ,α (β)) ∩ Pτ,α 6= ∅; moreover yτ,α (β) > 0. But β ⊥ α, hence yτ,α (β) ⊥
θ(τ ). Since θ(τ ) has negative scalar product with all roots in Pτ,α , we obtain that
Supp(yτ,α (β)) also contains some root having positive scalar product with θ(τ ). By
Lemma 5.5 (3) it follows that Supp(yτ,α (β))∩Π′ (τ ) 6= ∅. This implies the thesis. 

     Notice that if β ∈ Π \Π(τ ) and β 6⊥ ∆(τ ), then (β, θ(τ )) < 0. Let {∆ = ∆1 ⊃
· · · ⊃ ∆k } be the good chain of τ . By Lemma 5.5, for all β ∈ Π we have (β, θ(τ )) < 0
if and only if β ∈ Π′k−1 , where Π′k−1 = {β ∈ Π | (β, θk−1 ) 6= 0}, θk−1 being the
highest root of Πk−1 . Thus we obtain that Pτ,α = Π′k−1 ∩ α⊥ . We set, for α ∈ ∆+     ℓ
and τ ∈ X +
                              Wα,τ = W ((Π ∩ α⊥ ) \Π′k−1 ).
As seen in 2.9, Wα,τ \Wα is a poset with minimum and maximum. If w0α is the
longest element of Wα , and w0α,τ is the longest element of Wα,τ , then w0α,τ w0α
corresponds to the maximal element of Wα,τ \Wα . We set
                                 y̌α,τ = yα,τ w0α,τ w0α .
We can now describe the poset structure of Iab (τ, α).

Proposition 7.7. Let τ ∈ X + , and α ∈ ∆+        ℓ (τ ). Then the poset Iab (τ, α) is
isomorphic to Wα,τ \Wα . In particular Iab (τ, α) has a unique maximal element and
a unique minimal element. Moreover,
                             max Iab (τ, α) = i(tτ vτ y̌α,τ ).

Proof. Assume i, j ∈ Iab (τ, α). Then by Proposition 6.6, wi = tτ vτ y, wj = tτ vτ y ′ ,
with Ly , Ly′ ⊆ Π′ (τ ). Moreover i ⊆ j if and only if y ≤ y ′ . By Lemma 7.6, there
exist x, x′ ∈ Wα such that Lx , Lx′ ⊆ Pτ,α , y = yτ,α x, and y ′ = yτ,α x′ . Moreover,
y ≤ y ′ if and only if x ≤ x′ . By 2.9, this implies the claim. 

                         §8 Maximal elements in Iab (τ, α)

   In the previous section we have shown that Iab (τ, α) is not empty if and only
if α ∈ ∆+    ℓ (τ ) and in this case it has unique minimal and maximal elements, but
at this point we have no information about the relationships between Iab (τ, α) and
Iab (τ ′ , α). In this section we shall prove that max Iab (τ, α) ⊆ max Iab (τ ′ , α) if and
only if τ ≤ τ ′ . We remark that if τ ≤ τ ′ , then max Iab (τ, α) and min Iab (τ ′ , α)
may be not comparable.
     Let α ∈ ∆+
              ℓ . We set


                            Adj(α) = {α′ ∈ Π | (α, α′ ) 6= 0};

                Φ∗ (α) = {β ∈ ∆ | nα′ (β) = mα′ , for all α′ ∈ Adj(α)};
                                           X
                                 i∗ (α) =         gβ .
                                            β∈Φ∗ (α)

Notice that Adj(α) ∩ Supp(α) 6= 0, since (α, α) 6= 0.

   Consider the parabolic subsystems of ∆,
                         b
are orthogonal to α, ∆(Π ∩ α ) and ∆(Π ∩ α⊥ ), respectively. Recall that, for
                               ⊥

α ∈ ∆+                               ⊥
      ℓ , we have set Wα = W (Π ∩ α ). We also set:

           cα = W (Π
           W       b ∩ α ⊥),        b α = ∆(Π
                                    ∆       b ∩ α ⊥),      ∆α = ∆(Π ∩ α ⊥).

in particular w∗,α ∈ Wab ∩ W
           cα and Lx ⊆ {α0 }, then x ∈ Wab and x ≤ w∗,α . In particular, for all
(3) If x ∈ W
x ∈ Wab ∩ Wcα , we have x ≤ w∗,α .

Proof.
(1) It is clear that Φ∗ (α) ⊆ ∆+ and is an abelian set, i.e., for all β, β ′ ∈ Φ∗ (α),
β + β ′ is not a root. It also clear that if β ∈ Φ∗ (α) and β ′ ∈ ∆+ is such that β ′ ≥ β,
then β ′ ∈ Φ∗ (α). This proves that i∗ (α) is an abelian ideal of b.
(2) The first equality follows from section 3 and holds even if α 6⊥ θ. We prove the
second equality.
   Assume that α0 ⊥ α and β ∈ ∆      b + \∆+ . Then β = cα0 + P cγ γ, with c, cγ ∈
                                       α    α
                                                                 γ∈Π∩α⊥
                                                     P
N and c > 0, hence β = β+cδ with β = −cθ+                 cγ γ. Now nα′ (β) = −cmα′ for
                                                  γ∈Π∩α⊥
all α′ ∈ Adj(α). It follows that c = 1, hence that −β ∈ Φ∗ (α), and β ∈ −Φ∗ (α) + δ.
    Conversely, if β ∈ ∆+ is such that nα′ = mα for all α′ ∈ Adj(α), then −β +δ −α0
is either 0, or a non negative linear combination of roots in Π ∩ α⊥ , hence −β + δ ∈

(3) Assume x ∈ W cα and Lx ⊆ {α0 }. Then N (x) ⊆ ∆b + ; moreover, by 2.3 (3) we

Remark. Since for all w ∈ Wab we have Lw ⊆ {α0 }, by Lemma 8.1 (3) and 2.9 we
                            cα is isomorphic to Wα \W
obtain that the poset Wab ∩ W                       cα .

Lemma 8.2. Let {∆1 = ∆ ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k } be a good chain, and Πi = ∆i ∩ Π for
i = 1, . . . , k. Assume that k ≥ 2 and α ∈ Πk . Then nα (θk−1 ) = mα .
Proof. We assume by contradiction that nα (θk−1 ) < mα . We shall prove that then
for all β ∈ Πk we have that nβ (θk−1 ) < mβ : this is impossible since, by 6.8 (4), for
β ∈ Π′k we have mβ = nβ (θk ) ≤ nβ (θk−1 ).
   Assume β ∈ Πk . We first prove that, if nβ ′ (θk−1 ) < mβ ′ for some β ′ ∈ Adj(β),
                  mβ . Since β ∈ ∆k , we have (β, θi ) = 0 forPall i ∈ [k − 1], hence
then nβ (θk−1 ) < P
0 = (β, θ) =           mβ ′ (β, β ′ ), and 0 = (β, θk−1 ) =          nβ ′ (θk−1 )(β, β ′ ).
                 β ′ ∈Adj(β)                                        β ′ ∈Adj(β)
                                   ′                   ′
Since (β, β) > 0 and (β, β ) < 0 for all β 6= β in Adj(β), we obtain that, if
nβ ′ (θk−1 ) < mβ ′ for some β ′ 6= β in Adj(β), then nβ < mβ .
    Now, for all β ∈ Πk , there exists a sequence, β1 = α, . . . , βh = β, in Πk , such
that βi+1 ∈ Adj(βi ) for i = 1, . . . , h − 1. If nα (θk−1 ) < mα , we obtain inductively
that nβ (θk−1 ) < mβ . 


   Let α ∈ ∆+ ℓ . We recall that, by Remark 5.7 (3), there exists a unique maximal
good chain {∆ = ∆1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k } such that α ∈ ∆i for 1 ≤ i ≤ k: we shall call this
chain the maximal good chain of α. Any good chain the elements of which contain
α is an initial section of the maximal one.

Notation. Let α ∈ ∆+    ℓ . We denote by {∆ = ∆1 (α) ⊃ · · · ⊃ ∆k(α) (α)} the
maximal good chain of α, and for 1 ≤ h ≤ k(α), we denote by θh (α) the highest
root of ∆h (α). Moreover we set τ0 (α) = 0, and

                 h
                 X
      τh (α) =         θi (α)∨ ,   for 1 ≤ h ≤ k(α),       Xα = {τh (α) | 1 ≤ h ≤ k(α)}.
                 i=1


It is clear that if α ∈ ∆+                                   +
                         ℓ , then τ ∈ Xα if and only if α ∈ ∆ℓ (τ ). Thus by Remark
5.7 and Proposition 7.4 we have that Iab (τ, α) 6= ∅ if and only if τ ∈ Xα .

Proposition 8.3. Let α ∈ ∆+                                                          b
                                   ℓ and assume that k(α) ≥ 2. Then −θh (α) + δ ∈ ∆α ,
for all h ∈ {1, . . . , k(α) − 1}. Equivalently, for 1 ≤ h < k(α), we have nβ (θh (α)) =
mβ , for all β ∈ Adj(α).
Proof. Set k = k(α). We shall prove that for all β ∈ Adj(α) we have nβ (θk−1 ) = mβ ;
this clearly implies that nβ (θh ) = mβ for all h ∈ {1, . . . , k − 1}, which is equivalent
to the thesis. Let β ∈ Adj(α). If β ∈ Πk , then the claim follows directly from
Lemma 8.2. Assume β 6∈ Πk . We first show that β ∈ Πk−1 . If not, consider the
maximal i ∈ {1, . . . , k − 2} such that β ∈ Πi . Since α ∈ Πi+1 , β cannot belong to
any irreducible component of ∆i ∩ θi⊥ different from ∆i+1 ; it follows that β ∈ Π′i .
28                            PAOLA CELLINI PAOLO PAPI

But then, by property (2) of Definition 5.4, β ⊥ ∆i+2 : this is impossible, since
α ∈ ∆i+2 and β ∈ Adj(α). Thus we have β ∈ Πk−1 \Πk and β 6⊥ ∆k : this implies
that β ∈ Π′k−1 , hence, by 6.8 (4), nβ (θk−1 ) = mβ . 


     In the next Lemma we consider the element w̌α defined in section 7.
Lemma 8.4. (1) Let α ∈ ∆+                         c
                              ℓ and x ∈ Wab ∩ Wα . Then w̌α x ∈ Wab and i(w̌α x) ⊇
i(w̌α ). Moreover, dim i(w̌α x) = ℓ(w̌α ) + ℓ(x).
(2) Let α ∈ ∆+            c                                           c
               ℓ and x ∈ Wα be such that w̌α x ∈ Wab . Then x ∈ Wab ∩ Wα .

Proof. (1) If x ∈ Wab ∩ W     cα , then we have that N (x) ⊆ ∆− + δ, and N (x) ⊥
α. Consider z ∈ N (x), z = −β + δ, β ∈ ∆+ . We have β ⊥ α, so, by 7.1 (5),
β∈ / N (yα−1 ); it follows that yα N (x) ⊆ ∆− + δ. Moreover, yα N (x) ⊥ θ, therefore
w̌α N (x) = s0 yα N (x) = yα N (x). In particular, w̌α N (x) ∈ ∆       b + , hence by 2.7
                                                                −
w̌α ≤ w̌α x. Moreover, N (w̌α x) = N (w̌α ) ∪ w̌α N (x) ⊆ ∆ + δ, hence w̌α x ∈ Wab .
By 3.2 we obtain that i(w̌α ) ⊆ i(w̌α x). Moreover, we have dim i(w̌α x) = ℓ(w̌α x) =
ℓ(w̌α ) + ℓ(x).
(2) By 8.1 (3) it suffices to prove that Lx ⊆ {α0 }. If Lx 6⊆ {α0 }, then there exists
β ∈ Π ∩ α⊥ such that β ∈ N (x). By Proposition 7.3 (3) we have w̌α (β) > 0, hence
w̌α (β) ∈ N (w̌α x) ⊆ ∆− + δ. It follows that w̌α sβ ∈ Wab and i(w̌α sβ ) ) i(w̌α ).
But i(w̌α sβ ) ∈ Iab (θ ∨ , α), and, by 7.3 (1), Iab (θ ∨ , α) = {i(w̌α )}, thus we get a
contradiction. 


Lemma 8.5. Let α ∈ ∆+                                c
                    ℓ . Assume τ ∈ X, x ∈ Wab (τ ) ∩ Wα and set 2h =
(θ,θ)
  2 (τ, τ ). Then:
     (1) h ∈ {0, . . . , k(α) − 1} and w̌α x ∈ Wab (τh+1 (α), α);
     (2) yα (τ ) = θ2 (α)∨ + · · · + θh+1 (α)∨ .

Proof. By 8.4 (1), w̌α x ∈ Wab ; moreover, it is clear that w̌α x(α) = −θ +2δ. Let x =
tτ v, with v ∈ W . Then w̌α x ∈ Iab (θ ∨ + yα (τ ), α). By Proposition 7.4 and Remark
5.7 (3), we obtain that θ ∨ + yα (τ ) = τj (α) for some j ∈ {1, . . . , k(α)}. Since α ⊥ τ ,
we have that θ ⊥ yα (τ ), hence (θ,θ)   ∨             ∨
                                   2 (θ + yα (τ ), θ + yα (τ )) = 2(h + 1). By Remark
                            ∨
5.7 (1), it follows that θ + yα (τ ) = τh+1 (α) and hence that 1 ≤ h + 1 ≤ k(α), so
that h ∈ {0, . . . , k(α) − 1}. Moreover yα (τ ) = θ2 (α)∨ + · · · + θh+1 (α)∨ . 


Notation. Let α ∈ ∆+
                   ℓ . If k(α) > 1 and h ∈ [k(α) − 1], we set


               Ψh (α) = {β ∈ ∆h (α) | β = θh (α), or θh (α) − β ∈ ∆α };

                                   h
                                   [                            X
                        Φh (α) =         Ψi (α);   ih (α) =              gβ .

Moreover, we set Φ0 (α) = ∅, and i0 (α) to be the zero ideal. By Proposition 8.3
we directly obtain that Φh (α) ⊆ Φ∗ (α) for all h ∈ [k(α) − 1]. We remark that the
subsets Ψh (α), h ∈ [k(α) − 1], are pairwise disjoint.

Lemma 8.6. Let α ∈ ∆+       ℓ . Then ih (α) is an abelian ideal of b, for 0 ≤ h <
k(α). Set w̌h,α = wih (α) . Then w̌h,α ∈ Wab (τh (α)) ∩ W   cα . In particular w̌α w̌h,α ∈
Wab (τh+1 (α), α) and dim i(w̌α w̌h,α ) = ℓ(w̌α ) + ℓ(w̌h,α ).
Proof. We set k = k(α); ∆h = ∆h (α), θh = θh (α), τh = τh (α), and Φh = Φh (α),
for 0 ≤ h < k.
    If h = 0, the claim is trivial. Assume k ≥ 2 and 1 ≤ h ≤ k − 1. Since
Φh (α) ⊆ Φ∗ (α), by Lemma 8.1 (1) we obtain that ih (α) is an abelian subalgebra.
    Then let β ∈ Φh and β ′ ∈ ∆+ be such that and β ′ ≥ β. We shall prove that
β ′ ∈ Φh ; this will imply that ih (α) is an abelian ideal. It is clear that nγ (β ′ ) = mγ
for all γ ∈ Adj(α). Let i ∈ [h] be such that β ∈ ∆i and θi − β ∈ ∆α ∪ {0}. Assume
first β ′ ∈ ∆i . Then, since θi is dominant in ∆i , we have (θi , β ′ ) ≥ (θi , β) > 0.
Hence either β ′ = θi , or θi − β ′ ∈ ∆. In the latter case, since θi − β ′ ≤ θi − β,
we have that θi − β ′ ∈ ∆α ; therefore β ′ ∈ Φh . Next assume β ′ ∈         / ∆i and let
j, 1 ≤ j ≤ i − 1, be such that β ∈ ∆j and β 6∈ ∆j+1 . If β ⊥ θj , then β ′ is
                                        ′             ′                 ′

included in some connected component of ∆j ∩ θj⊥ . But, for all α′ ∈ Adj(α), we
have nα′ (β ′ ) = mα′ > 0; moreover Adj(α) ∩ Supp(α) 6= ∅, and Supp(α) ∈ ∆j+1 ,
hence we obtain that β ′ ∈ ∆j+1 , a contradiction. Hence β ′ 6⊥ θj . It follows that
either β ′ = θj , or θj − β ′ ∈ ∆, and, indeed, θj − β ′ ∈ ∆α . Thus β ′ ∈ Φh . This
concludes the proof that ih (α) ∈ Iab .
    By definition, θi ∈ Φh for all i ∈ [h]; moreover β 6∈ Φh for all β ∈ ∆h ∩ θh⊥ .
It follows that −θi + δ ∈ N (w̌h,α ) for all i ∈ [h], and −β + δ 6∈ N (w̌h,α ) for all
β ∈ ∆h ∩ θh⊥ . By Proposition 6.2, it follows that w̌h,α ∈ Wab (τh ).
    If β ∈ Ψj (α), for some j ∈ [h], then, by definition, −β + δ − (−θj + δ) ∈ ∆α ,
and since, by 8.3, −θj + δ ∈ ∆    b α , we obtain that −β + δ ∈ ∆  b α . Since N (w̌h,α ) =
{−β + δ | β ∈ Φh }, we obtain that N (w̌h,α ) ⊆ ∆   b α , hence that w̌h,α ∈ Wcα .
    By 8.5 and 8.4 (1) we finally obtain that w̌α w̌h,α ∈ Wab (τh+1 (α), α), and
dim i(w̌α w̌h,α ) = ℓ(w̌α ) + ℓ(w̌h,α ). 


Remark. For α ∈ ∆+     ℓ and 0 ≤ h < k(α), let w̌h,α = wih (α) , as in the statement of
8.6. Notice that i0 (α) is the zero ideal, hence w̌0,α = 1. Notice, moreover, that, for
h>0
                                N (w̌h,α ) = −Φh (α) + δ.


Proposition 8.7. Let α ∈ ∆+       ℓ , 0 ≤ h < k(α), and i ∈ Iab (τh+1 (α), α). Then
                   −1                    cα .
i ⊇ i(w̌α ), and w̌α wi ∈ Wab (τh (α)) ∩ W
Proof. Set τ = τh+1 (α). By Lemma 8.6 we have that w̌α w̌h,α ∈ Wab (τ, α). Set
j = min Iab (τ, α). By Proposition 7.5, for each w ∈ Wab (τ, α) we have that w = wj y
with y ∈ Wα . In particular, for all w, w′ ∈ Wab (τ, α) we have that w−1 w′ ∈ Wα .
                                                             cα . Then by Lemma 8.4
Thus wi = w̌α w̌h,α y, with y ∈ Wα , and therefore w̌h,α y ∈ W
(2) we obtain that w̌h,α y ∈ Wab ∩ W cα , and it is clear that w̌h,α y ∈ Wab (τh (α), α).
Moreover, by 8.4 (1), i ⊇ i(w̌α ). 

These posets have been studied also in [P], [S]. If i ∈ Iab , then i ∈ Iab (α) if and
only if wi (α) = −θ + 2δ. We can now obtain the following results.

                                                              cα . In particular,
Corollary 8.8. (Suter) The poset Iab (α) is isomorphic to Wα \W
it has a unique minimal element and a unique maximal element. Moreover,

                  min Iab (α) = i(w̌α ),     max Iab (α) = i(w̌α w∗,α ).

Proof. By Proposition 8.7 and Lemma 8.4, i ∈ Iab (α) if and only if wi = w̌α x with
x ∈ Wab ∩ W  cα ; moreover, in this case, N (w̌α x) = N (w̌α ) ∪ w̌α N (x). Therefore, if
                                                              cα , then i ⊆ j if and only
i, j ∈ Iab (α), wi = w̌α x, and wj = w̌α y, with x, y ∈ Wab ∩ W
if x ≤ y. By Lemma 8.1 and the subsequent remark we get the claim. 

Corollary 8.9. Assume i ∈ Iab , α ∈ ∆+   ℓ and τ ∈ Xα .
  (1) i ∈ Iab (α) if and only if min Iab (α) ⊆ i ⊆ max Iab (α).
  (2) i ∈ Iab (τ, α) if and only if min Iab (τ, α) ⊆ i ⊆ max Iab (τ, α).
Proof. (1) The “only if” part is a trivial consequence of Corollary 8.8. Conversely,
assume that min Iab (α) ⊆ i ⊆ max Iab (α). Then there exists x ∈ W such that
wi = w̌α x and N (wi ) = N (w̌α ) ∪ w̌α N (x). Since N (wi ) ⊆ N (w̌α w∗,α ), it follows
that N (x) ⊆ N (w∗,α ) ⊆ ∆  b α ; therefore x(α) = α and wi (α) = w̌α (α) = −θ + 2δ.
(2) The “only if” part follows from Propositions 7.5 and 7.7. Conversely, assume
min Iab (τ, α) ⊆ i ⊆ max Iab (τ, α), and let τ = τh (α), h ∈ [k(α)]. By item (1),
i ∈ Iab (α), hence i ∈ Iab (τh′ (α), α), for some h′ ∈ [k(α)]. By Proposition 6.2,
gθi (α) ⊂ i if and only if i ∈ [h′ ]; similarly, gθi (α) is contained in min Iab (τ, α) and
max Iab (τ, α), hence in i, if and only if i ∈ [h]. Hence h = h′ . 

     We set
                                  m(α) = max Iab (α),
thus m(α) = i(w̌α w∗,α ).

   By Proposition 7.7, if Iab (τ, α) is not empty, then it has a unique maximal
element. For all 1 ≤ h ≤ k(α), we set

                              mh (α) = max Iab (τh (α), α).

We can now explicitly describe mh (α).

Proposition 8.11. For all α ∈ ∆+
                               ℓ , and 0 ≤ h < k(α), we have

                                 mh+1 (α) = i(w̌α w̌h,α ).

Proof. Set τ − = τh (α). By Proposition 8.7, wmh+1 (α) = w̌α x, with x ∈ Wab (τ − ) ∩
cα . By Lemma 8.6 it suffices to prove that w̌α x ≤ w̌α w̌h,α , and this is equivalent
W
to prove that N (x) ⊆ N (w̌h,α ). Recall that N (w̌h,α ) = {−β + δ | β ∈ Φh (α)}.
Assume β ∈ N (x) and β = −β + δ, with β ∈ ∆+ . We shall prove that β ∈ Φh (α).
   We set ∆i = ∆i (α), and θi = θi (α), for 1 ≤ i ≤ h. Since ∆h = ∆(τ − ), by
Proposition 6.2 we have that β 6∈ ∆h ∩ θh⊥ , in particular β 6∈ ∆h+1 . Let i ∈ [h]
be such that β ∈ ∆i and β 6∈ ∆i+1 ; then β ∈ ∆j for 1 ≤ j ≤ i. We first prove
that there exists j ∈ {1, . . . , i} such that (β, θj ) > 0. We assume, by contradiction,
that (β, θj ) = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Since β 6∈ ∆i+1 , we obtain that β belongs to a
connected component of ∆i ∩ θi⊥ distinct from ∆i+1 , in particular β ⊥ ∆i+1 , and
hence β ⊥ θj also for j ≥ i + 1. But this implies that β ⊥ τ − , which is impossible,
by 6.1 (4). Therefore there exists j ∈ {1, . . . , i} such that (β, θj ) > 0. Then either
β = θj , or θj − β ∈ ∆+ . Moreover, since −θj + δ and β belong to ∆      b α , we have that
θj −β = β −(−θj +δ) ∈ ∆   b α ∪{0}. But θj −β ∈ ∆∪{0}, therefore θj −β ∈ ∆α ∪{0}.
This means that β ∈ Φh (α). 

   For any good chain {∆ = ∆1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ ∆k }, we have that Πi ∪ {−θi + δ} is a basis
for a subsystem ∆   b i of ∆b which can be identified with the affine root system of ∆i .
               +
   Let α ∈ ∆ℓ , k = k(α), and ∆i = ∆i (α), for i ∈ [k]. We consider the parabolic
subsystem of ∆   b i generated by (Πi ∪ {−θi + δ}) ∩ α⊥ : this is a finite and not
necessarily irreducible system. If 1 ≤ i < k, then −θi + δ ⊥ α, and we denote
by ∆b i (α) the irreducible component of ∆((Πi ∪ {−θi + δ}) ∩ α⊥ ) which includes
−θi + δ. By 8.3, ∆    b i (α) ⊆ ∆
                                b α . Notice that if α ⊥ θ, then ∆ b 1 (α) is equal to the
system ∆  b 1 which occurs in 8.10.
   If k(α) > 1 and 1 ≤ h ≤ k(α) − 1, we set
                               b h (α)+ | (β, (−θh + δ)∨ ) = −1} ∪ {0}.
                 Ψh (α) = {β ∈ ∆

Lemma 8.12. Let 1 ≤ h < k(α). We have
                            Ψh (α) = {θh − β | β ∈ Ψh (α)}.
In particular,
                          |Ψh (α)| = |Ψh (α)| = gh (α) − 1,
where gh (α) is the dual Coxeter number of ∆ b h (α).

Proof. Since ∆b h (α)+ ⊆ ∆
                         b+                                   b
                           α , by Lemma 8.1 we obtain that ∆h (α)
                                                                     +\

−1, then β + (−θh + δ) is a root, and therefore β ∈ ∆. Then it is clear that
θh − β ∈ ∆h , hence, by definition, θh − β ∈ Ψh (α).
   Conversely, assume β ∈ Ψh (α) and β 6= θh . Then it is clear that (θh − β, (−θh +
  ∨
δ) ) = −1; moreover, θh − β is positive and belongs, by definition, to ∆α . It follows
that θh − β ∈ Ψh (α).
   By Proposition 7.1 (3) and (5) we have that |Ψh (α)| = gh (α) − 1. 

                                               i=1



Proof. By Proposition 8.11, wmh+1 (α) = w̌α w̌h,α , for 0 ≤ h < k(α); moreover,
by Lemma 8.6, N (w̌α w̌h,α ) = N (w̌α ) ∪ w̌α N (w̌h,α ). We have N (w0,α ) = ∅, and
N (w̌h,α ) = −Φh (α) + δ for 1 ≤ h < k(α); since Φh−1 (α) ⊂ Φh (α), we obtain that
w̌α wh−1,α < w̌α w̌h,α , for 1 ≤ h < k(α). Therefore mh (α) ⊂ mh+1 (α). It follows
that mk(α) (α) = max Iab (α), hence, by Corollary 8.8, mk(α) (α) = m(α).
   By Lemma 8.6, we have that dim mh (α) = ℓ(w̌α ) + ℓ(wh−1,α ). By 7.1 (3),

ℓ(w̌α ) = g − 1. Moreover, |N (wh−1,α )| = |Φh−1 (α)| =        Ψi , and since the sets

Ψi (α) are pairwise disjoint, by 8.12, we obtain that ℓ(wh−1,α ) =         (gi (α) − 1).   

such that j ⊇ i, then wi−1 wj ∈ W

Proof. By assumption wj ≥ wi , in the weak order, hence there exists x ∈ W      c such
that wj = wi x and ℓ(wj ) = ℓ(wi ) + ℓ(x). Moreover N (wj ) = N (wi ) ∪ wi N (x),
with wi N (x) ⊆ ∆  b + , and indeed, since wj ∈ Wab , wi N (x) ⊆ ∆− + δ. Assume by
contradiction that x 6∈ W   cα and set x = x′ sβ x′′ , with x′ ∈ Wcα , β ∈ Πb \α⊥ , and
ℓ(x) = ℓ(x′ ) + 1 + ℓ(x′′ ), so that x′ (β) ∈ N (x). Notice that then β 6= α, otherwise
we have α = x′ (α) ∈ N (x) and hence −θ+2δ = wi (α) ∈ N (wj ), which is impossible.
Thus, since α is simple and long, we have (β, α∨ ) = −1, hence (wi x′ (β), wi x′ (α)) =
(wi x′ (β), −θ ∨ + 2δ) = −1. But this implies that wi x′ (β) ∈ ∆+ + Zδ, which is
impossible since wi x′ (β) ∈ N (wj ) ⊆ ∆− + δ. We have therefore that x ∈ W   cα . 


  Notice that if α ∈ ∆ℓ (τ ) and τ = θ1∨ + · · · + θk∨ is the standard orthogonal
decomposition of τ , then τ = τk (α).

Corollary 8.15. Assume τ ∈ X + , α, β ∈ Πℓ (τ ), α 6= β, i ∈ Iab (τ, α), and j ∈
Iab (τ, β). Then i, j are not comparable. In particular, if τ = θ1∨ + · · · + θk∨ is the
standard orthogonal decomposition of τ , the maximal elements of Iab (τ ) are exactly
the ideals mk (α) with α ∈ Πℓ (τ ).
Proof. Assume by contradiction i ⊆ j. Then by 8.14 j ∈ Iab (τ, α), which is absurd.
The last assertion follows from Proposition 6.7. 

ideals in Iab (τ, α), Iab (τ, β) for α, β ∈ ∆+

Proposition 8.16. If α ∈ Πℓ , then m(α) is a maximal abelian ideal of b.
Proof. If i ⊇ m(α), then by Lemma 8.14 wi ∈ Iab (τ, α) for some τ ∈ Xα , hence by
Theorem 8.13 i ⊆ m(α). 


Remark. Notice that if τ = τk(α) (α), then α 6⊥ τ ; conversely, if τ ∈ Xα and
τ = τh (α) with 1 ≤ h < k(α), then α ⊥ τ . Hence the maximal ideals of b which
belong to Iab (τ ) are exactly the m(α) with α ∈ Πℓ (τ ) and α 6⊥ τ .

Corollary 8.17. (Panyushev). The map α 7→ m(α) is a bijection between long
simple roots and maximal abelian ideals of b.
Proof. The claim follows from Proposition 8.16, Corollary 8.15, and Theorems 4.4,
8.13. 



                         §9 Dimension formulas for mh (α)

   In this section we determine the dimension of mh (α), for all α ∈ Πℓ and 1 ≤ h ≤
k(α). This calculation has the following interesting consequence. It is easy to see
that the maximal dimension d of a maximal commutative subalgebra of g coincides
with the maximal dimension of an abelian ideal of b (for a proof see [R, §7]). Hence

                                  d = max {dim m(α)} .
                                       α∈Πℓ


As expected from Theorem 8.13 we shall see that the maximum is obtained when α
is a long simple root having maximal distance from the affine node in the extended
Dynkin diagram of ∆. The dimensions dim mh (α) will be uniformly calculated
using Theorem 8.13: these calculations afford, as a special case, a conceptual ex-
planation of the case by case calculations in [PR, Tables I, II], and in turn, a proof
of Malcev’s classical result on the dimension of a maximal commutative subalgebra
[M]. We use for Dynkin diagrams the numbering of [B].
   Before looking at the ideals mh (α) for each type of root system, we note that,
in general, for any long simple root α we have m1 (α) = max Iab (θ ∨ , α) and
dim m1 (α) = g − 1.

Note that the second summand in the r.h.s. (i.e., ℓ(w̌i,αh )) is independent from n.
The previous calculation can be expressed as follows

For n = 3 we have d = 5, obtained for h = 1, i = 2. For n ≥ 4 we have d = n(n−1)2

and this value is obtained for h = n − 1 and i = ⌊ n2 ⌋ (for n = 4 it is also obtained
for h = 1, i = 2).

   We have X + = {θ ∨ }. There is only one maximal ideal corresponding to the
unique simple long root; it has dimension 3.

Remark. It is also possible to obtain the previous results using Proposition 7.7.
Indeed
          dim (max Iab (α, τ )) = ℓ(vτ ) + ℓ(yτ,α ) + ℓ(w0α ) − ℓ(w0α,τ )
where w0α , is the longest elements in Wα and w0α,τ is the longest element in W ((π ∩
α⊥ ) \Pτ,α ).
   Now ℓ(vτ ) = |∆2τ | = |∆even
                              τ  | − |∆0τ |, ℓ(yτ,α ) = g(∆(τ )) − 2 and the last two
summands in the r.h.s. of the previous formula can be easily calculated determining
the number of positive roots of the corresponding subsystems.
   As an example, we will write down the computations for types An and E6 for
the maximal ideals, displaying the results as follows. Set τα = τk(α) (α).

We use the following notational conventions: if in the rightmost column appears a
root system of negative rank, then the whole column must not be considered (e.g.,
type An , k = 1). Moreover a root system of rank zero should be regarded as the
