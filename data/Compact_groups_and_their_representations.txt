                                                    Abstract. This is an overview article on compact Lie groups and their representations, written for the
                                                    Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics to be published by Elsevier.



                                                In this article we describe the structure and representation theory of compact Lie groups. Throughout
                                            the article, G is a compact real Lie group with Lie algebra g. Unless otherwise stated, G is assumed to be
                                            connected. The word “group” will always mean a “Lie group” and the word “subgroup” will mean a closed
                                            Lie subgroup. The notation Lie(H) stands for the Lie algebra of a Lie group H. We assume that the reader
                                            is familiar with the basic facts of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, which can be found in the article
                                            Lie groups: general theory in this Encyclopedia, or in the books listed in the bibliography.

                                                                               1. Examples of compact Lie groups
                                               Examples of compact groups include
                                                  • Finite groups
                                                  • Quotient groups Tn = Rn /Zn , or more generally, V /L, where V is a finite-dimensional real vector
                                                    space and L is a lattice in V , i.e. a discrete subgroup generated by some basis in V . Groups of this
                                                    type are called tori; it is known that every commutative connected compact group is a torus.
                                                  • Unitary groups U(n) and special unitary groups SU(n), n ≥ 2.
                                                  • Orthogonal groups O(n) and SO(n), n ≥ 3.
                                                  • The groups U (n, H), n ≥ 1, of unitary quaternionic transformations, which are isomorphic to
                                                    Sp(n) := Sp(n, C) ∩ SU(2n).
                                               The groups O(n) have two connected components, one of which is SO(n).
                                               The groups SU(n) and Sp(n) are connected and simply-connected.
                                               The groups SO(n) are connected but not simply-connected: for n ≥ 3, the fundamental group of SO(n) is
                                            Z2 . The universal cover of SO(n) is a simply-connected compact Lie group denoted by Spin(n). For small n,
                                            we have isomorphisms: Spin(3) ≃ SU(2), Spin(4) ≃ SU(2) × SU(2), Spin(5) ≃ Sp(4), Spin(6) ≃ SU(4).

                                                                    2. Relation to semisimple Lie algebras and Lie groups
                                            2.1. Reductive groups. A Lie algebra g is called
                                                 • simple if it is non-abelian and has no ideals different from {0} and g itself.
                                                 • semisimple if it is a direct sum of simple ideals.
                                                 • reductive if it is a direct sum of semisimple and commutative ideals.
                                            We call a connected Lie group G simple or semisimple if Lie(G) has this property.
                                            Theorem 1. Let G be a connected compact Lie group and g = Lie(G). Then
                                              (1) The Lie algebra g = Lie(G) is reductive: g = a ⊕ g′ , where a is abelian and g′ = [g, g] is semisimple.
                                              (2) The group G can be written in the form G = (A × K)/Z, where A is a torus, K is a connected,
                                                  simply-connected compact semisimple Lie group, and Z is a finite central subgroup in A × K.
                                              (3) If G is simply-connected, it is a product of simple compact Lie groups.
                                              The proof of this results is based on the fact that the Killing form of g is negative semidefinite.

Example 1. The group U(n) contains as the center the subgroup C of scalar matrices. The quotient group
U(n)/C is simple and isomorphic to SU(n)/Zn . The presentation of Theorem 1 in this case is

                         U(n) = T1 × SU(n) /Zn = C × SU(n) / C ∩ SU(n) .
                                                     
For the group SO(4) the presentation is SU(2) × SU(2) /{±(1 × 1)}.
   This theorem effectively reduces the study of the structure of connected compact groups to the study of
simply-connected compact simple Lie groups.
2.2. Complexification of a compact Lie group. Recall that for a real Lie algebra g, its complexifica-
tion is gC = g ⊗ C with obvious commutator. It is also well-known that gC is semisimple or reductive iff g is
semisimple or reductive respectively. There is a subtlety in the case of simple algebras: it is possible that a
real Lie algebra is simple, but its complexification gC is only semisimple. However, this problem never arises
for Lie algebras of compact groups: if g is a Lie algebra of a real compact Lie group, then g is simple if and
only if gC is simple.
   The notion of complexification for Lie groups is more delicate.
Definition 1. Let G be a connected real Lie group with Lie algebra g. A complexification of G is a
connected complex Lie group GC (i.e. a complex manifold with a structure of a Lie group such that group
multiplication is given by a complex analytic map GC × GC → GC ) which contains G as a closed subgroup,
and such that Lie(GC ) = gC . In this case, we will also say that G is a real form of GC .
   It is not obvious why such a complexification exists at all; in fact, for arbitrary real group it may not
exist. However, for compact groups we do have the following theorem.
Theorem 2. Let G be a connected compact Lie group. Then it has a unique complexification GC ⊃ G.
Moreover, the following properties hold:
   (1) The inclusion G ⊂ GC is a homotopy equivalence. In particular, π1 (G) = π1 (GC ) and the quotient
       space GC /G is contractible.
   (2) Every finite-dimensional representation of G can be uniquely extended to a complex analytic repre-
       sentation of GC .
  Since a Lie algebra of a compact Lie group G is reductive, we see that GC must be reductive; if G is
semisimple or simple, then so is GC . The natural question is whether every complex reductive group can be
obtained in this way. The following theorem gives a partial answer.
Theorem 3. Every connected complex semisimple Lie group H has a compact real form: there is a compact
real subgroup K ⊂ H such that H = KC . Moreover, such a compact real form is unique up to conjugation.
Example 2. The unitary group U(n) is a compact real form of the group GL(n, C).
  The orthogonal group SO(n) is a compact real form of the group SO(n, C).
  The group Sp(n) is a compact real form of the group Sp(n, C).
  The universal cover of GL(n, C) has no compact real form.
   These results have a number of important applications. For example, they show that study of representa-
tions of a semisimple complex group H can be replaced by the study of representations of its compact form;
in particular, every representation is completely reducible (this argument is known as Weyl’s unitary trick).
2.3. Classification of simple compact Lie groups. Theorem 1 essentially reduces such classification
to classification of simply-connected simple compact groups, and Theorem 2, Theorem 3 reduce it to the
classification of simple complex Lie algebras. Since the latter is well-known, we get the following result.
Theorem 4. Let G be a connected, simply-connected simple compact Lie group. Then gC must be a simple
complex Lie algebra and thus can be described by a Dynkin diagram of one the following types: An , Bn , Cn ,
Dn , E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 , G2 .
  Conversely, for each Dynkin diagram in the above list, there exists a unique up to isomorphism simply-
connected simple compact Lie group whose Lie algebra is described by this Dynkin diagram.

   For types An , . . . , Dn , the corresponding compact Lie groups are well-known classical groups shown in
the table below:
    An , n ≥ 1     Bn , n ≥ 2       Cn , n ≥ 3 Dn , n ≥ 4
    SU(n + 1) Spin(2n + 1)            Sp(n)     Spin(2n)
   The restrictions on n in this table are made to avoid repetitions which appear for small values of n. Namely,
A1 = B1 = C1 , which gives SU(2) = Spin(3) = Sp(1); D2 = A1 ∪A1 , which gives Spin(4) = SU(2)× SU(2);
B2 = C2 , which gives SO(5) = Sp(4) and A3 = D3 , which gives SU(4) = Spin(6). Other than that, all entries
are distinct.
   Exceptional groups E6 , . . . , G2 also admit explicit geometric and algebraic descriptions which are related
to the exceptional non-associative algebra O of so-called octonions (or Cayley numbers). For example, the
compact group of type G2 can be defined as a subgroup of SO(7) which preserves an almost complex structure
on S 6 . It can also be described as the subgroup of GL(7, R) which preserves one quadratic and one cubic
form, or, finally, as a group of all automorphisms of O.

                                              3. Maximal tori
3.1. Main properties. In this section, G is a compact connected Lie group.
Definition 2. A maximal torus in G is a maximal connected commutative subgroup T ⊂ G.
  The following theorem lists the main properties of maximal tori.
Theorem 5.
  (1) For every element g ∈ G, there exists a maximal torus T ∋ g.
  (2) Any two maximal tori in G are conjugate.
  (3) If g ∈ G commutes with all elements of a maximal torus T , then g ∈ T .
  (4) A connected subgroup H ⊂ G is a maximal torus iff the Lie algebra Lie(H) is a maximal abelian
      subalgebra in Lie(G).
Example 3. Let G = U(n). Then the set T of diagonal unitary matrices is a maximal torus in G; moreover,
every maximal torus is of this form after a suitable unitary change of basis. In particular, this implies that
every element in G is conjugate to a diagonal matrix.
Example 4. Let G = SO(3). Then the set D of diagonal matrices is a maximal commutative subgroup in
G, but not a torus. Here D consists of 4 elements and is not connected.
3.2. Maximal tori and Cartan subalgebras. The study of maximal tori in compact Lie groups is closely
related to the study of Cartan subalgebras in reductive complex Lie algebras (see [Se] for a definition of a
Cartan subalgebra).
Theorem 6. Let G be a connected compact Lie group with Lie algebra g, and let T ⊂ G be a maximal torus
in G, t = Lie(T ) ⊂ g. Let gC , GC be the complexification of g, G as in Theorem 2.
   Let h = tC ⊂ gC . Then h is a Cartan subalgebra in gC . Conversely, every Cartan subalgebra in GC can be
obtained as tC for some maximal torus T ⊂ G.
   This allows us to use results about Cartan subalgebras (such as root decomposition, properties of root
systems, etc.) when studying compact Lie groups. From now on, we will denote by R ⊂ h∗ the root system
of gC ; it can be shown that in fact, R ⊂ it∗ . We will also use notation α∨ ⊂ it for the coroot corresponding
to a root α ∈ R. Definitions of these and related notions can be found in [Se] or in the article Lie groups:
general theory in this encyclopedia.
3.3. Weights and roots. Let G be semisimple. Recall that the root lattice Q ⊂ it∗ is the abelian group
generated by roots α ∈ R, and let the coroot lattice Q∨ ⊂ it be the abelian group generated by coroots α∨ ,
α ∈ R. Define also the weight and coweight lattices by
                                     P = {λ | hα∨ , λi ∈ Z   ∀α ∈ R} ⊂ it∗
                                    P ∨ = {t | ht, αi ∈ Z ∀α ∈ R} ⊂ it,
4                             ALEXANDRE KIRILLOV AND ALEXANDER KIRILLOV JR




where h ·, · i is the pairing between t and the dual vector space t∗ .
  It follows from the definition of root system that we have inclusions
                                                     Q ⊂P ⊂ it∗
(1)
                                                   Q∨ ⊂P ∨ ⊂ it
  Both P, Q are lattices in it∗ ; thus, the index (P : Q) is finite. It can be computed explicitly: if αi is a
basis of the root system, then the fundamental weights ωi defined by
(2)                                                hα∨
                                                     i , ωj i = δij

form Pa basis of P . The simple roots αi are related to fundamental weights ωj by the Cartan matrix A:
αi = Aij ωj . Therefore, (P : Q) = (P ∨ : Q∨ ) = | det A|.
   Definitions of P , Q, P ∨ , Q∨ if g also make sense when g reductive but not semisimple. However, in this
case they are no longer lattices: rk Q < dim t∗ , and P is not discrete.
   We can now give more precise information about the structure of the maximal torus.
Lemma 1. Let T be a compact connected commutative Lie group, and t = Lie(T ) its Lie algebra. Then the
exponential map is surjective and preimage of unit is a lattice L ⊂ t. There is an isomorphism of Lie groups
                                                   exp : t/L → T.
In particular, T ≃ Rr /Zr = Tr , r = dim T .
                                           1
    Let X(T ) ⊂ it∗ the lattice dual to   2πi L:

(3)                                X(T ) = {λ ∈ it∗ | hλ, li ∈ 2πiZ ∀l ∈ L}.
It is called the character lattice for T (see Section 4.3).
Theorem 7. Let G be a compact connected Lie group, and let T ⊂ G be a maximal torus in G.
  Then Q ⊂ X(T ) ⊂ P . Moreover, the group G is uniquely determined by the Lie algebra g and the lattice
X(T ) ∈ t∗ which can be any lattice between Q and P .
Corollary. For a given complex semisimple Lie algebra a, there are only finitely many (up to isomorphism)
compact connected Lie groups G with gC = a.
   The largest of them is the simply-connected group, for which T = t/2πiQ∨, X(T ) = P ; the smallest is
the so-called adjoint group, for which T = t/2πi P ∨, X(T ) = Q.
Example 5. Let G = U(n). Then it = {real diagonal matrices}. Choosing the standard basis of matrix
units in it, we identify it ≃ Rn , which also allows us to identify it∗ ≃ Rn . Under this identification,
                                                                       X
                                     Q = {(λ1 , . . . , λn ) | λi ∈ Z,   λi = 0},
                                     P = {(λ1 , . . . , λn ) | λi ∈ R, λi − λj ∈ Z},
                                 X(T ) = Zn .
Note that Q, P are not lattices: Q ≃ Zn−1 , P ≃ R × Zn−1 .
   Now let G = SU(n). Then it∗ = Rn /R · (1, . . . , 1), and Q, P are the images of Q, P for G = U(n) in this
quotient. In this quotient they are lattices, and (P : Q) = n. The character lattice in this case is X(T ) = P ,
since SU(n) is simply-connected. The adjoint group is PSU(n) = SU(n)/C, where C = {λ · id | λn = 1} is
the center of SU(n).
3.4. Weyl group. Let us fix a maximal torus T ⊂ G. Let N (T ) ⊂ G be the normalizer of T in G:
N (T ) = {g ∈ G  gT g −1 = T }. For any g ∈ N (T ) the transformation A(g) : t 7→ gtg −1 is an automorphism
of T . According to Theorem 5, this automorphism is trivial iff g ∈ T . So in fact, it is the quotient group
N (T )/T which acts on T .
Definition 3. The group W = N (T )/T is called the Weyl group of G.

  Since the Weyl group acts faithfully on t and t∗ , it is common to consider W as a subgroup in GL(t∗ ).
  It is known that W is finite.
  The Weyl group can also be defined in terms of Lie algebra g and its complexification gC .
Theorem 8. The Weyl group coincides with the subgroup in GL(it∗ ) generated by reflections sα : x 7→
x − 2(α,x)                                              ∗
    (α, α) , α ∈ R. Here ( , ) is the bilinear form on h induced by the Killing form of g.

Theorem 9.
      (1) Two elements t1 , t2 ∈ T are conjugate in G iff t2 = w(t1 ) for some w ∈ W .
      (2) There exists a natural homeomorphism of quotient spaces G/ Ad G ≃ T /W , where Ad G stands for
          action of G on itself by conjugation. (Note, however, that these quotient spaces are not manifolds:
          they have singularities.)
      (3) Let us call a function f on G central if f (hgh−1 ) = f (g) for any g, h ∈ G. Then the restriction map
          gives an isomorphism
               {continuous central functions on G} ≃ {W -invariant continuous functions on T }
Example 6. Let G = U(n). The set of diagonal unitary matrices is a maximal torus, and the Weyl group
is the symmetric group Sn acting on diagonal matrices by permutations of entries. In this case, Theorem 9
shows that if f (U ) is a central function of a unitary matrix, then f (U ) = f˜(λ1 , . . . , λn ), where λi are
eigenvalues of U and f˜ is a symmetric function in n variables.

                                 4. Representations of compact groups
4.1. Basic notions. By a representation of G we understand a pair (π, V ) where V is a complex vector
space and π is a continuous homomorphism G → Aut(V ). This notation is often shortened to π or V . In this
article we only consider finite-dimensional representations; in this case, the homomorphism π is automatically
smooth and even real-analytic.
   We associate to any f.d. representation (π, V ) of G the representation (π∗ , V ) of the Lie algebra g = Lie(G)
which is just the derivative of the map π : G → Aut V at the unit point e ∈ G. In terms of the exponential
map we have the following commutative diagram
                                                     π
                                                G −−−−→ Aut V

   Choosing a basis in V , we can write the operators π(g) and π∗ (X) in matrix form and consider π and π∗
as matrix valued functions on G and g. The diagram above means that
(4)                                            π(exp X) = eπ∗ (X) .
Recall that if G is connected, simply-connected, then every representation of g can be uniquely lifted to
a representation of G. Thus, classification of representations of connected simply-connected Lie groups is
equivalent to the classification of representations of Lie algebras.
   Let (π1 , V1 ) and (π2 , V2 ) be two representation of the same group G. An operator A ∈ Hom(V1 , V2 )
is called an intertwining operator, or simply an intertwiner, if A ◦ π1 (g) = π2 (g) ◦ A for all g ∈ G.
Two representations are called equivalent if they admit an invertible intertwiner. In this case, using an
appropriate choice of bases, we can write π1 and π2 by the same matrix-valued function.
   Let (π, V ) be a representation of G. If all operators π(g), g ∈ G, preserve a subspace V1 ⊂ V , then the
restrictions π1 (g) = π(g)|V1 define a subrepresentation (π1 , V1 ) of (π, V ). In this case, the quotient space
V2 = V /V1 also has a canonical structure of a representation, called the quotient representation.
   A representation (π, V ) is called reducible if it has a non-trivial (different from V and {0}) subrepre-
sentation. Otherwise it is called irreducible.

    We call representation (π, V ) unitary if V is a Hilbert space and all operators π(g), g ∈ G, are unitary,
i.e. given by unitary matrices in any orthonormal basis. We use a short term “unirrep” for a “unitary
irreducible representation”.
4.2. Main theorems. The following simple but important result was one of the first discoveries in repre-
sentation theory. It holds for representations of any group, not necessarily compact.
Theorem 10 (Schur Lemma). Let (πi , Vi ), i = 1, 2, be any two irreducible finite-dimensional representations
of the same group G. Then any intertwiner A : V1 → V2 is either invertible or zero.
Corollary 1. If V is an irreducible f.d. representation, then any intertwiner A : V → V is scalar: A = c · id,
c ∈ C.
Corollary 2. Every irreducible representation of a commutative group is one-dimensional.
  The following theorem is the fundamental results of the representation theory of compact groups. Its
proof is based on the technique of invariant integrals on a compact group, which will be discussed in the
next section.
Theorem 11.
  (1) Any f.d. representation of a compact group is equivalent to a unitary representation.
  (2) Any f.d. representation is completely reducible: it can be decomposed into direct sum
                                                   M
                                              V =      ni Vi
        where Vi are pairwise non-equivalent unirreps. Numbers ni ∈ Z+ are called multiplicities.
4.3. Examples of representations. The representation theory looks rather different for abelian (i.e. com-
mutative) and non-abelian groups. Here we consider two simplest examples of both kinds.
   Our first example is a 1-dimensional compact connected Lie group. Topologically it is a circle which we
realize as a set T ≃ U(1) of all complex numbers t with absolute value 1.
   Every unirrep of T is one-dimensional; thus, it is just a continuous multiplicative map π of T to itself. It
is well-known that every such a map has the form
                                        πk (t) = tk    for some   k ∈ Z.
The collection of all unirreps of T is itself a group, called Pontrjagin dual of T and denoted by T.b This
group is isomorphic to Z.
   By Theorem 11, any f.d. representation π of T is equivalent to a direct sum of 1-dimensional unirreps.
                                                                           b = Z taking non-negative values:
So, an equivalence class of π is defined by the multiplicity function µ on T
                                                    X
                                                π≃      µ(k) · πk .
                                                      k∈Z
   The many-dimensional case of compact connected abelian Lie group can be treated in a similar way. Let
T be a torus, i.e. an abelian compact group, t = Lie(T ). Then every irreducible representation of T is
one-dimensional and thus is defined by a group homomorphism χ : T → T1 = U(1). Such homomorphisms
are called characters of T . One easily sees that such characters themselves form a group (Pontrjagin dual
of T ). If we denote by L the kernel of the exponential map t → T (see Lemma 1), one easily sees that every
character has a form
                                  χ(exp(t)) = eht,λi    λ ∈ it∗ , λ ∈ X(T )
where X(T ) ⊂ t is the lattice defined by (3). Thus, we can identify the group of characters Tb with X(T ).
                 ∗

In particular, this shows that Tb ≃ Zdim T .
   The second example is the group G = SU(2), the simplest connected, simply-connected non-abelian
compact Lie group. Topologically G is a 3-dimensional sphere since the general element of G is a matrix of
the form                                  

                                                                              

Let V be 2-dimensional complex vector space, realized by column vectors            . The group G acts naturally
                                                                               v
on V . This action induces the representation Π of G in the space S(V ) of all polynomials in u, v. It is
infinite-dimensional, but has many f.d. subrepresentations. In particular, let S k (V ), or simply S k , be the
space of all homogeneous polynomials of degree k. Clearly, dim S k = k + 1.
   It turns out that the corresponding f.d. representations (Πk , S k ), k ≥ 0, are irreducible, pairwise non-
equivalent and exhaust the set G   b of all unirreps.
   Some particular case are of special interest:
     (1) k = 0. The space V0 consists of constant functions and Π0 is the trivial 1-dimensional representation:
         Π0 (g) ≡ 1.
     (2) k = 1. The space V1 is identical to V and Π1 is just the tautological representation π(g) ≡ g.
     (3) k = 2. The space V2 is spanned by monomials u2 , uv, v 2 . The remarkable fact is that this repre-
                                                                                   2   2        2
                                                                                                  −v 2
         sentation is equivalent to a real one. Namely, in the new basis x = u +v    2   , y = u 2i    , z = iuv we
         have                                                                     
                                              ℜ(a2 + b2 )   2ℑ(ab)    ℑ(b2 − a2 )
                                  a b
                            Π2             =  2ℑ(ab)       |a|2 − |b|2  2ℜ(ab)  .
                                  −b a             2    2
                                                ℑ(a + b )     2ℜ(ab)    ℜ(a2 − b2 )
         This formula defines a homomorphism Π2 : SU(2) → SO(3). It can be shown that this homomorphism
         is surjective, and its kernel is the subgroup {±1} ⊂ SU(2):
                                                         2      Π
                                      1 → {±1} ֒→ SU(2) −→ SO(3) → 1.
        The simplest way to see it is to establish the equivalence of Π2 with the adjoint representation of G
        in g. The corresponding intertwiner is
                                                                                  
                     2             2                      2           iβ    α + iγ

                                                                  −α + iγ     −iβ
        Note that SU(2) and SO(3) are the only compact groups associated with the Lie algebra sl(2, C).
   The group G contains the subgroup H of diagonal matrices, isomorphic to T1 . Consider the restriction
of Πn to T1 . It splits into the sum of unirreps πk as follows:
                                                          s=[n/2]
                                                           X
                                            Res G
                                                T1 Πn =             πn−2s .
                                                           s=0
The characters πk which enter this decomposition are called the weights of Πn . The collection of all weights
(together with multiplicities) forms a multiset in Tb denoted by P (Πn ), or P (S n ).
   Note the following features of this multiset:
    (1) P (Πn ) is invariant under reflection k 7→ −k.
    (2) All weights of Πn are congruent modulo 2.
    (3) The non-equivalent unirreps have different multisets of weights.
   Below we show how these features are generalized to all compact connected Lie groups.

                                           5. Fourier transform
5.1. Haar measure and invariant integral. The important feature of compact groups is the existence of
so-called “invariant integral”, or “average”.
Theorem 12. For every compact Lie group G, there exists a unique
                                                               R     measure dg on G, called Haar measure,
which is invariant under left shifts Lg : h 7→ gh and satisfies G dg = 1.
  In addition, this measure is also invariant under right shifts h 7→ hg and under involution h 7→ h−1 .
  Invariance of the Haar measure implies that for every integrable function f (g), we have
                         Z            Z              Z              Z
                           f (g) dg =    f (hg) dg =    f (gh) dg =    f (g −1 ) dg
                             G             G                G                 G
8                            ALEXANDRE KIRILLOV AND ALEXANDER KIRILLOV JR




    For a finite group G the integral with respect to the Haar measure is just averaging over the group:
                                           Z
                                                          1 X
                                              f (g) dg =       f (g)
                                            G            |G|
                                                                    g∈G

For compact connected Lie groups the Haar measure is given by a differential form of top degree which is
invariant under right and left translations.
   For a torus T n = Rn /Zn with real coordinates θk ∈ R/Z or complex coordinates tk = e2πiθk , the Haar
                                                Qn    dtk
measure is dn θ := dθ1 dθ2 · · · dθn or dn t := k=1 2πit k
                                                           .
   In particular, consider a central function f (see Theorem 9). Since every conjugacy class contains elements
of the maximal torus T (see Theorem 5), such a function is determined by its values on T , and integral of
a central function can be reduced to integration over T . The resulting formula is called Weyl integration
formula. For G = U(n) it looks as follows:
                                     Z                  Z          Y
                                                      1
                                            f (g)dg =        f (t)     |ti − tj |2 dn t
                                       U(n)           n! T         i<j

where T is the maximal torus consisting of diagonal matrices
                                      t = diag(t1 , . . . , tn ),    tk = e2πiθk ,
and dn t is defined above.
  Weyl integration formula for arbitrary compact group G can be found in [Si] or [B, Section 18].
  The main applications of the Haar measure is the proof of complete reducibility theorem (Theorem 11)
and orthogonality relations (see below).
5.2. Orthogonality relations and Peter-Weyl theorem. Let V1 , V2 be unirreps of a compact group G.
Taking any linear operator A : V1 →RV2 and averaging the expression A(g) := π2 (g −1 ) ◦ A ◦ π1 (g) over G, we
get an intertwining operator hAi = G A(g)dg. Comparing this fact with the Schur lemma, one obtains the
following fundamental results.
   Let (π, V ) be any unirrep of a compact group G. Choose any orthonormal basis {vk , 1 ≤ k ≤ dim V } in
V and denote by tVkl , or tπkl , the function on G defined by
                                              tVkl (g) = (π(g)vl , vk ).
The functions tVkl are called matrix elements of the unirrep (π, V ).
Theorem 13 (Orthogonality relations).
   (1) The matrix elements tVkl are pairwise orthogonal and have norm (dim V )−1/2 in L2 (G, dg).
   (2) The matrix elements corresponding to equivalent unirreps span the same subspace in L2 (G, dg).
   (3) The matrix elements of two non-equivalent unirreps are orthogonal.
   (4) The linear span of all matrix elements of all unirreps is dense in C(G), C ∞ (G) and in L2 (G, dg).
       (Generalized Peter-Weyl theorem).
                                                   b of equivalence classes of unirreps is countable.
  In particular, this theorem implies that the set G
  For a f.-d. representation (π, V ) we introduce the character of π as a function
                                                                    dim
                                                                     XV
(5)                                     χπ (g) = tr π(g) =                tπkk (g).
                                                                    k=1
It is obviously a central function on G.
Remark. Traditionally, in representation theory the word “character” has two different meanings: 1. A
multiplicative map from a group to U(1). 2. The trace of a representation operator π(g). For 1-dimensional
representations both notions coincide.
    ¿From orthogonality relations we get the following result.
Corollary. The characters of unirreps of G form an orthonormal basis in the subspace of central functions
in L2 (G, dg).

5.3. Non-commutative Fourier transform. The non-commutative Fourier transform on a compact group
G is defined as follows. Let G b denote the set of equivalence classes of unirreps of G. Choose for any λ ∈ Gb
a representation (πλ , Vλ ) of class λ and an orthonormal basis in Vλ . Denote by d(λ) the dimension of Vλ .
   We introduce the Hilbert space L2 (G)      b as the space of matrix-valued functions on G
                                                                                           b whose value at a
point λ ∈ Gb belongs to Matd(λ) (C). The norm is defined as
                                                     X                       

  For a function f on G define its Fourier transform fe as a matrix valued function on G:
                                                                                       b

                                     Z               X                      
                       2
                 ||f ||L2 (G, dg) :=   |f (g)|2 dg =   d(λ) · tr fe(λ)fe(λ)∗ =: ||fe||2L2 (G)
                                                                                           b .
                                        G               b
                                                      λ∈G

    (3) The following inversion formula expresses f in terms of fe:
                                            X                        
                                    f (g) =     d(λ) · tr fe(λ)πλ (g) .
                                                  b
                                                λ∈G

    (4) The Fourier transform send the convolution to the matrix multiplication:
                                                f^        e e
                                                 1 ∗ f2 = f1 · f2

        where the convolution product ∗ is defined by
                                                   Z
                                   (f1 ∗ f2 )(h) =    f1 (hg)f2 (g −1 ) dg.
                                                          G

  Note the special case of the inversion formula for g = e:
                                 X                              X
                         f (e) =     d(λ) · tr fe(λ) , or δ(g) =   d(λ) · χλ (g)
                                    b
                                  λ∈G                                   b
                                                                      λ∈G
                                            R
where δ(g) is Dirac’s delta function: G f (g)δ(g) dg = f (e). Thus we get a presentation of Dirac’s delta
function as a linear combination of characters.

                      6. Classification of finite-dimensional representations
  In this section, we give a classification of unirreps of a connected compact Lie group G.

6.1. Weight decomposition. Let G be a connected compact group with maximal torus T , and let (π, V )
be a f.d. representation of G. Restricting it to T and using complete reducibility, we get the following result.
Theorem 15. The vector space V can be written in the form
                          M
(6)                 V =        Vλ ,    Vλ = {v ∈ V | π∗ (t)v = hλ, tiv         ∀t ∈ t}.
                              λ∈X(T )

where X(T ) is the character group of T defined by (3).

     The spaces Vλ are called weight subspaces, vectors v ∈ Vλ — weight vectors of weight λ. The set
(7)                                      P (V ) = {λ ∈ X(T ) | Vλ 6= {0}}
is called the set of weights of π, or the spectrum of ResG
                                                         T π, and

                                             mult(π, V ) (λ) := dim Vλ
is called the multiplicity of λ in V .
     The next theorem easily follows from the definition of the Weyl group.
Theorem 16. For any f. d. representation V of G, the set of weights with multiplicities is invariant under
the action of the Weyl group:
                            w(P (V )) = P (V ),      mult(π, V ) (λ) = mult(π, V ) (w(λ))
for any w ∈ W .
6.2. Classification of unirreps. Recall that R is the root system of gC . Assume that we have chosen
a basis of simple roots α1 , . . . , αr ⊂ R. Then R = R+ ∪ R− ; roots α ∈ R+ can be written as a linear
combination of simple roots with positive coefficients, and R− = −R+ .
    A (not necessarily finite-dimensional) representation of gC is called a highest weight representation if
it is generated by a single vector v ∈ Vλ (the highest weight vector) such that gα v = 0 for all positive roots
α ∈ R+ .
    It can be shown that for every λ ∈ X(T ), there is a unique irreducible highest weight representation of
gC with highest weight λ, which is denoted L(λ). However, this representation can be infinite-dimensional;
moreover, it may not be possible to lift it to a representation of G.

                                                            i i ∈ Z+ for any simple root αi . The set of
Definition 4. A weight λ ∈ X(T ) is called dominant if hλ, α∨
all dominant weights is denoted by X+ (T ).
Theorem 17.
                                                 P
  (1) All weights of Lλ are of the form µ = λ − ni αi , ni ∈ Z+ .
  (2) Let λ ∈ X+ . Then the irreducible highest weight representation L(λ) is finite-dimensional and lifts
      to a representation of G.
  (3) Every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of G is of the form L(λ) for some λ ∈ X+ .
     Thus, we have a bijection {unirreps of G} ↔ X+ .
Example 7. Let G = SU(2). There is a unique simple root α and the unique fundamental weight ω, related
by α = 2ω. Therefore, X+ = Z+ · ω and unirreps are indexed by non-negative integers. The representation
with highest weight k · ω is precisely the representation Πk constructed in Section 4.3.
Example 8. Let G = U(n). Then X = Zn , and X+ = {(λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ Zn | λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λn }. Such objects
are well known in combinatorics: if we additionally assume that λn ≥ 0, then such dominant weights are in
bijection with partitions with n parts. They can also be described by Young diagrams with n rows (see
[FH]).
6.3. Explicit construction of representations. In addition to description of unirreps as highest weight
representations, they can also be constructed in other ways. In particular, they can
                                                                                  P be defined analytically
as follows. Let B = HN+ be the Borel subgroup in GC ; here H = exp h, N+ = exp α∈R+ cα eα . For λ ∈ h∗ ,
let χλ : B → C× be a multiplicative map defined by
(8)                                               χλ (hn) = ehh,λi .
Theorem 18 (E.Cartan–Borel–Weil). Let λ ∈ X(T ). Denote by V (λ) be the space of complex-analytic
functions on GC which satisfy the following transformation property:
                                    f (gb) = χ−1
                                              λ (b)f (g),     g ∈ GC ,   b ∈ B.

The group GC acts on V (λ) by left shifts:
                                                   
(9)                                           π(g)f (h) = f (g −1 h).
      (1) V (λ) 6= {0} iff −λ ∈ X+ .
      (2) If −λ ∈ X+ , the representation of G in V (λ) is equivalent to L(w0 (λ)), where w0 ∈ W is the unique
          element of the Weyl group which sends R+ to R− .
   This theorem can also be reformulated in more geometric terms: the spaces V (λ) are naturally interpreted
as spaces of global sections of appropriate line bundles on the flag variety B = GC /B = G/T .
   For classical groups irreducible representations can also be constructed explicitly as the subspaces in
tensor powers (Cn )⊗k , transforming in a certain way under the action of the symmetric group Sk .

                                     7. Characters and multiplicities
7.1. Characters. Let (π, V ) be a finite-dimensional representation of G and let χπ be its character as
defined by (5). Since χπ is central, and every element in G is conjugate to an element of T , χπ is completely
determined by its restriction to T , which can be computed from the weight decomposition (6):
                                         X                    X
(10)                           χπ |T =        dim Vλ · eλ =        multπ λ · eλ
                                         λ∈X(T )                λ∈X(T )

where eλ is the function on T defined by eλ (exp(t)) = eht,λi , t ∈ t. Note that eλ+µ = eλ eµ and that e0 = 1.

7.2. Weyl character formula.
Theorem 19 (Weyl character formula). Let λ ∈ X+ . Then
                                     Aλ+ρ            X
                              χL λ =      ,    Aµ =    ε(w)ew(µ)
                                      Aρ
                                                                w∈W

                                                                                           1
                                                                                               P
where, for w ∈ W , we denote ε(w) = det w considered as a linear map t∗ → t∗ , and ρ =     2   R+   α.

   In particular, computing the value of the character at point t = 0 by L’Hopital’s rule, it is possible to
deduce the following formula for the dimension of irreducible representations:
                                                    Y hα∨ , λ + ρi
(11)                                   dim L(λ) =                   .
                                                          hα∨ , ρi
                                                         α∈R+

Example 9. Let G = SU(2). Then Weyl character formula gives, for irreducible representation Πk with
highest weight k · ω
                                  xk+1 − x−(k+1)
                         χ Πk =                  = xk + xk−2 + · · · + x−k ,   x = eω
                                     x − x−1
which implies dim Πk = k + 1.
  Weyl character formula is equivalent to the following formula for weight multiplicities, due to Kostant:
                                             X
                              multL(λ) µ =        ǫ(w)K(w(λ + ρ) − ρ − µ),
                                                   w∈W

where K is Kostant’s partition function: K(τ ) is the number of ways of writing τ as a sum of positive roots
(with repetitions).
  For classical Lie groups such as G = U(n), there are more explicit combinatorial formulas for weight
multiplicities; for U(n), the answer can be written in terms of the number of Young tableaux of a given
shape. Details can be found in [FH].

7.3. Tensor product multiplicities.
                                P      Let (π, V ) be a finite-dimensional representation of G. By complete
reducibility, one can write V =   nλ L(λ). The coefficients nλ are called multiplicities; finding them is an
important problem in many applications. In particular, a special case of this is finding the multiplicities in
tensor product of two unirreps:                        X
                                                              ν
                                      L(λ) ⊗ L(µ) =        Nλµ  L(ν).
   Characters provide a practical tool of computing multiplicities: since
                                                                        Pcharacters of unirreps are linearly
independent, multiplicities can be found from the condition that χV = nλ χL(λ) . In particular,
                                                      X
                                                           ν
                                        χL(λ) χL(µ) =    Nλµ χL(ν) .
Example 10. For G = SU(2), tensor product multiplicities are given by
                                                    M
                                       Πn ⊗ Πm =         Πl
where the sum is taken over all l such that |m − n| ≤ l ≤ m + n, m + n + l is even.
   For G = U(n), there is an algorithm for finding the tensor product multiplicities, formulated in the
language of Young tableaux (Littlewood–Richardson rule). There are also tables and computer programs for
computing these multiplicities; some of them are listed in the bibliography.
