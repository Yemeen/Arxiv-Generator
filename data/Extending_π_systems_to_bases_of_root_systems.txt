                                                      Let R be an indecomposable root system. It is well known that any root
                                                  is part of a basis B of R. But when can you extend a set of two or more
                                                  roots to a basis B of R? A π-system is a linearly independent set of roots,
                                                  C, such that if α and β are in C, then α − β is not a root. We will use
                                                  results of Dynkin and Bourbaki to show that with two exceptions, A3 ⊂ Bn
                                                  and A7 ⊂ E8 , an indecomposable π-system whose Dynkin diagram is a
                                                  subdiagram of the Dynkin diagram of R can always be extended to a basis
                                                  of R.


                                            1    Introduction
                                            Let R be an indecomposable root system in a Euclidean space V . A subset B
                                            of R is called a basis of R if B is a vector space basis of V and each root of R
                                            can be written as a linear combination of roots in B with integral coefficients that

                                                                                      1
are all nonnegative or all nonpositive. It is well known that any root is part of
a basis B of R. But when can you extend a set of two or more roots to a basis
B of R? A π-system ([Dyn, Oni-Vin]) is a linearly independent set of roots, C,
such that if α and β are in C, then α − β is not a root. (It is not assumed to be
linearly independent in [Oni-Vin].) A subset of a basis will be a π-system, and a
π-system will be a basis of a root subsystem. We can associate a Dynkin diagram
to a π-system, and in order to extend to a basis of R, the Dynkin diagram of the
π-system must be a subdiagram of the Dynkin diagram of R. By a subdiagram
we mean a diagram obtained by deleting some nodes and their corresponding
links. We will assume that the nodes corresponding to short roots are marked, and
that the subdiagram preserves the marking. Hence two orthogonal short roots do
not form a subdiagram of Bn , while two orthogonal long roots do. We will use
results of Dynkin ([Dyn] and Bourbaki ([Bou] to show that with two exceptions,
A3 ⊂ Bn and A7 ⊂ E8 , an indecomposable π-system whose Dynkin diagram is
a subdiagram of the Dynkin diagram of R can always be extended to a basis of
R. Our techniques can easily handle the decomposable case, too, but the results
become more tedious to state, and we feel that it would distract from the main
ideas of the paper.
    We would like to thank professor Robert V. Moody for pointing out the results
from Bourbaki to us during his visit to Singapore.


2    Results from Dynkin and Bourbaki
If C is a set of roots, then [C] denotes the set of all roots in R that are linear com-
binations of the roots in C with integer coefficients. Let Π and Π′ be π-systems.
We will say that Π′ is obtained from Π by an elementary transformation if Π′ is
obtained by adjoining the lowest root to one of the indecomposable components
of Π and then removing one root from that component.
    We will first state three results due to Dynkin ([Dyn, Theo. 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3]).
Proposition 1. Let C be a π-system in a root system, R. Then [C] is a root
subsystem of R with basis C.
Proposition 2. Let C be a π-system in an indecomposable root system, R, of rank
n. Then C can be extended to a π-system, D, with n elements.
Proposition 3. Let D be a π-system with n elements in an indecomposable root
system, R, of rank n. Then D can be obtained by a sequence of elementary trans-
formations of a basis of R.
    This shows that extending C will not always give us a basis of R, but that the
extension can be obtained by a sequence of elementary transformations of a basis
of R.

                                          2
    The next three propositions are due to Bourbaki ([Bou, Coro. to Prop. 4, Coro.
4 to Prop. 20 and Prop. 24 of Chap. VI, §1]).

Proposition 4. Let V ′ be a subspace of V and let V ′′ be the subspace spanned by
R′ = R ∩ V ′ . Then R′ is a root system in V ′′ .

    Notice that V ′ may intersect R so that dim V ′′ < dim V ′ .

Proposition 5. If C a subset of a basis B of R and V ′ the subspace of V spanned
by C, then C is a basis of the root system R′ = R ∩ V ′ .

   Notice that [C] uses integer coefficients, while R′ = R ∩ V ′ includes rational
coefficients. This proposition says that a if C is a subset of a basis, then [C] = R′ .

Proposition 6. Let C be a basis of R′ = R ∩ V ′ , where V ′ is a subspace of V .
Then C can be extended to a basis B of R and R′ is the set of roots in R that are
linear combinations of elements of C.

    This says that if [C] = R′ , then C can be extended to a basis of R.
    Then next result is a simple combination of Propositions 1 to 6.

Theorem 7. Let C be a π-system in R and let V ′ be the subspace of V spanned
by C. Then [C] is a root subsystem of R′ = R ∩ V ′ , C can be obtained from a
basis of R′ by a sequence of elementary transformations, and C can be extended
to a basis B of R if and only if C is a basis of R′ , i.e., [C] = R′ .

Proof. It follows from Proposition 1 that [C] is a root subsystem of R′ = R ∩ V ′
with basis C. In general [C] 6= R′ , so we can only use Proposition 3 to say that
C is obtained from a basis of R′ by a sequence of elementary transformations. If
[C] = R′ , then it follows from Proposition 6 that C can be extended to a basis of
R. The converse follows from Proposition 5.


3    Extension results
It follows from Theorem 7 that C will extend to a basis of R unless there is a root
system R′ such that
                                [C] ⊂ R′ ⊂ R,
where rank [C] = rank R′ < rank R, [C] 6= R′ and C can be obtained from a
basis of R′ by a sequence of elementary transformations. We are for simplicity
assuming that [C] is indecomposable, and hence R′ is also indecomposable. The
next lemma is proved by inspection of the extended Dynkin diagrams.



                                          3
Lemma 8. The only indecomposable roots systems [C] ⊂ R′ where C can be
obtained by a sequence of elementary transformations of a basis of R′ are listed
below.


                 A3 ⊂ B3 , Dn ⊂ Bn for n ≥ 4, A7 ⊂ E7 ,
            A8 ⊂ E8 , D8 ⊂ E8 , B4 ⊂ F4 , D4 ⊂ F4 , A2 ⊂ G2 .

   D4 ⊂ F4 is obtained by using two elementary transformations, while all the
other only require one.
    Since our pairs must sit inside a root system, R, of higher rank, and the dia-
gram of C must be a subdiagram of the diagram of R, there are only two cases
that satisfies our conditions, A3 ⊂ B3 ⊂ Bn and A7 ⊂ E7 ⊂ E8 .
    The only way C can fail to extend is if C is obtained from an R′ diagram by
an elementary transformation so that C includes the lowest root of R′ . We will
see in the next theorem that in that case we can use the fact that the lowest root is
a linear combination of all the roots in the basis to show that [C] 6= R′ .

Theorem 9. An indecomposable π-system, C, in R can be extended to a basis B
of R, unless [C] ⊂ R is on of the following two cases.

   1. A3 ⊂ Bn for n ≥ 4 and C = {r1 , r2 , r3 } has Dynkin diagram

                                        r❝1       r❝2   r❝3

      and (r1 + 2r2 + r3 )/2 is a root in Bn .

   2. A7 ⊂ E8 and C = {r1 , . . . , r7 } has Dynkin diagram

                            r❝1   r❝2   r❝3       r❝4   r❝5   r❝6   r❝7

      and
                          (r1 + 2r2 + 3r3 + 4r4 + 3r5 + 2r6 + r7 )/2
      is a root in E8 .

Proof. We cannot use the pairs in Theorem 8 involving E8 , F4 and G2 , because
we cannot fit them into any bigger root systems. We also cannot fit a Dk diagram
inside Bn , so we are left with A3 ⊂ B3 ⊂ Bn and A7 ⊂ E7 ⊂ E8 .
    We will use the bases for the root systems listed in [Bou] and denote the lowest
root by α0 .

                                              4
    For A3 ⊂ Bn , either A3 is the Y-branch at the end of the extended diagram
of B3 or A3 is part of the diagram of Bn . In the first case, r2 = α2 and either
r1 or r3 must be the lowest root −(α1 + 2α2 + 2α3 ) and the other must be α1 .
In either case, we can recover the deleted root from the lowest root, giving us
(r1 + 2r2 + r3 )/2 = −α3 = −e3 , which is a root of Bn , but not in [C]. So V ′ is the
span of {e1 , e2 , e3 }, and R′ = B3 while [C] = A3 . Hence C cannot be extended
to a basis of Bn by Theorem 7.
                                                 r1
                                    α❝ 3 ✟ r❝✏ ✏❝
                                             2 ✏
                                         ❍ PP  P r❝3
    However, if C = {α1 , α2 , α3 } corresponds to an A3 that is a subdiagram of
the diagram of Bn , then (r1 + 2r2 + r3 )/2 is not a root of Bn . In this case V ′ does
not contain any short roots, so R′ = [C] and C can be extended to a basis of Bn .
    For A7 ⊂ E8 , the A7 is either part of the diagram of E8 or is part of the
extended diagram of E7 . In the E8 case we have

                             C = {α1 , . . . , α8 } − {α2 },
       and in the extended E7 case we have

                            C = {α0 , α1 , . . . α7 } − {α2 },
       where α0 = −2α1 − 2α2 − 3α3 − 4α4 − 3α5 − 2α6 − α7 is the lowest root of
E7 .
    In the extended E7 case we don’t know whether r1 or r7 is the extended root,
but again we can recover the deleted root from the lowest root, giving us

                 (r1 + 2r2 + 3r3 + 4r4 + 3r5 + 2r6 + r7 )/2 = −α2 .
    In the E8 case this expression will not be a root. It follows that in the extended
E7 case C can be extended to a basis of E8 , while in the E8 case C can only be
extended to a basis of A8 .
    Notice that C = {α1 , α2 , α0 , } = {e1 − e2 , e2 − e3 , −e1 − e2 }, where α0 is the
lowest short root in Cn is not a π-system in Cn , since e1 −e2 −(−e1 −e2 ) = 2e1 is
a root in Cn . We initially considered linearly independent sets of roots with non-
positive inner products, i.e., linearly independent, admissible (nonpositive inner
product) sets of roots instead of π-systems. π-systems are always admissible, and
for simply laced root systems, indecomposable π-systems are admissible, since
the only way the difference between two roots can have the same length as the
two roots is if the angle between them is π/3. However, C ⊂ Cn shows that this
is false for multiply laced root systems. In particular, Exercise 34 on page 177 of


                                            5
[Oni-Vin] appears to be incorrect. (They do not require π-systems to be linearly
independent, but that does not make any difference.)
    Notice that Dk ⊂ Bk is listed in Lemma 8, while Dk ⊂ Ck is not. There are
two standard ways of constructing equal rank inclusions of root systems. One
is to use elementary transformations and is used by Borel and de Siebenthal
([Bor-Sib]). The other is to consider the set of short and long roots in multiply
laced root systems. Dk forms the long roots in Bk and the short roots in Ck , but
only the Bk inclusion can be obtained by an elementary transformation.
    Notice also that we only talk about root systems, and not about Lie subalge-
bras. Unless we know something about the Cartan subalgebras, inclusions of root
systems and inclusions of Lie algebras will not necessarily correspond. The fact
that Dk ⊂ Ck does not imply that so(2n) ⊂ sp(2n).
