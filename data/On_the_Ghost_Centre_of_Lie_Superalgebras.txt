                                                    Abstract. We define a notion of ghost centre of a Lie superalgebra g = g0 ⊕ g1 which
                                                    is a sum of invariants with respect to the usual adjoint action (centre) and invariants
                                                    with respect to a twisted adjoint action (“anticentre”). We calculate the anticentre in
                                                    the case when the top external degree of g1 is a trivial g0 -module. We describe the
                                                    Harish-Chandra projection of the ghost centre for basic classical Lie superalgebras and
                                                    show that for these cases the ghost centre coincides with the centralizer of the even part
                                                    of the enveloping algebra.
                                                       The ghost centre of a Lie superalgebra plays a role of the usual centre of a Lie algebra
                                                    in some problems of representation theory. For instance, for g = osp(1, 2l) the annihilator
                                                    of a Verma module is generated by the intersection with the ghost centre.




                                                                                     1. Introduction

                                             1.1. Let g0 be a complex finite dimensional Lie algebra and Z(g0 ) be the centre of its
                                             universal enveloping algebra. Then Z(g0 ) acts on a simple g-module by an infinitesimal
                                             character and consequently, such characters separate representations. Moreover, in the
                                             case when g0 is semisimple, the annihilator of a Verma module is generated by the kernel
                                             of the corresponding infinitesimal character.
                                               Let g = g0 ⊕ g1 be a complex finite dimensional Lie superalgebra and Z(g) be the
                                             (super)centre of its universal enveloping algebra U(g). All g-modules considered below
                                             are assumed to be Z2 -graded and “g-simple module” means simple as graded module.
                                             The centre Z(g) acts on a simple g-module by an infinitesimal character, but, even in the
                                             “nice” case g = osp(1, 2l), the annihilator of a Verma module is not always generated by
                                             the kernel of the corresponding infinitesimal character. In [GL] we described, for the case
                                                                                        e
                                             g = osp(1, 2l), a polynomial subalgebra Z(g)    of U(g) which acts on a simple module by
                                             “supercharacter”. The annihilator of a Verma module is generated by the kernel of the
                                             corresponding supercharacter.
                                                                                                    e
                                                In this paper we introduce a notion of ghost centre Z(g) (see 2.1.2). This is a subalgebra
                                             of U(g) which contains both Z(g) and a centre of U(g) considered as associative algebra.
                                                            e
                                             The algebra Z(g)     acts on a simple module by “supercharacter” and separates graded
                                             representations (see 2.2).

   By definition, Z(g) is a sum of Z(g) and so-called anticentre A(g). The last one is the
set of invariants of U(g) with respect to a ‘nonstandard adjoint action’ ad′ g introduced
in [ABF]. The product of two elements from the anticentre lies in the centre and the
product of an element from the centre and an element from the anticentre belongs to the
anticentre.
                          e
  As well as Z(g) itself, Z(g)   is not easy to describe and, in general, it is not noetherian
algebra. However, in the case when the top external degree Λtop g1 of g1 is a trivial g0 -
module, A(g) itself as well as its image in the symmetric algebra can be easily described—
see Theorem 3.3. The above condition on Λtop g1 holds for the simple finite-dimensional
Lie superalgebras apart from the W (n) type.
   The existence of non-zero anticentral elements implies two “negative” results. The
first one is that the direct generalization of the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture does not hold
for the Lie superalgebras with even dimensional g1 —see 3.5.2. The second one is that
Separation theorem does not hold for the classical basic Lie superalgebras apart from the
simple Lie algebras and the superalgebras osp(1, 2l)—see 4.5.


1.2. In the case g = osp(1, 2l) Arnaudon, Bauer, Frappat ([ABF]) and Musson ([Mu])
constructed a remarkable even element T in the enveloping algebra U(g). This element
is ad′ g-invariant and its Harish-Chandra projection is the product of hyperplanes cor-
responding to the positive odd roots. The element T has been called ‘Casimir’s ghost’
in [ABF], since its square belongs to the centre.
  In 3.3 we construct such element T ∈ A(g) for any g such that Λtop g1 is a trivial g0 -
module. The image of T in the symmetric algebra belongs to Λtop g1 . In Section 4 we
show that in the case when g is a basic classical Lie superalgebra, the Harish-Chandra
projection of T is also the product of hyperplanes corresponding to the positive odd roots.
  In [S2] A. Sergeev described the set of ‘anti-invariant polynomials’ which are the in-
variants of the dual algebra U(g)∗ with respect to the nonstandard adjoint action ad′ g.


1.3. Content of the paper. In Section 2 we define our main objects: the anticentre
                            e
A(g) and the ghost centre Z(g).                              e
                                   We describe the action of Z(g) on the modules of finite
length in the case when g is finite dimensional.
   In Section 3 we show that A(g) is equal to zero if dim g1 is infinite. Moreover all
elements of A(g) are either even (if dim g1 is even) or odd (otherwise). We describe
the structure of A(g) when Λtop g1 is a trivial g0 -module. Namely, we prove that as a
vector space A(g) is isomorphic to Z(g0 ). The central step of the proof is Theorem 3.2.3
which states that for any g0 -module L, the induced g-module Indgg0 L and the coinduced
g-module Coindgg0 L are isomorphic up to grading. This theorem allows us to define T as
a unique up to a scalar ad′ g-invariant element inside the ad′ g-module generated by 1.
                                                                                          3




   In Section 4 we consider the case when g is a complex classical basic Lie superalgebra.
In this case, the Harish-Chandra projection of Z(g) is described by Kac and Sergeev
(see [S1]). In Corollary 4.2.4, we describe the Harish-Chandra projection of A(g).
   We say that an element u ∈ U(g) acts on a module M by a superconstant if it acts by
the multiplication by a scalar on each graded component Mi (i = 0, 1). In the case when
                                                            e
g is finite dimensional and dim g1 is even, any element of Z(g)  acts on a simple module
M by a superconstant (see 2.2). In Corollary 4.4.4 we show that if g is a basic classical
Lie superalgebra then any element of U(g) acting by a superconstant on each simple
                                       e
finite dimensional module belongs to Z(g).             e
                                             Moreover Z(g)  coincides with the centre (and
the centralizer) of the even part U(g)0 of the universal enveloping algebra. For the case
g = osp(1, 2l) the last result was proven in [GL].

                                   2. Ghost centre

  In this paper the ground field is C. Let g = g0 ⊕ g1 be a finite dimensional Lie super-
algebra such that g1 6= 0. Everywhere except 2.1, g is assumed to be finite dimensional.
All g-modules are assumed to be Z2 -graded. We denote by Π the parity change functor:
Π(M) := M ⊗ Π(C) where Π(C) is the trivial odd representation. Denote by U(g) the
enveloping superalgebra of g and by Z(g) the (super)centre of U(g).

2.1. For a homogeneous u ∈ U(g) denote by d(u) its Z2 -degree. For a U(g)-bimodule
M one defines the adjoint action of g on M by setting (ad g)m := gm − (−1)d(g)d(m) mg
where m ∈ M, g ∈ g are homogeneous elements and d(m) denotes the Z2 -degree of m.
Define a twisted adjoint action ad′ of g on M as the adjoint action of g on the bimodule
Π(M). One has
                            (ad′ g)(u) = gm − (−1)d(g)(d(m)+1) mg.
Assume that M has a superalgebra structure such that g(m1 m2 ) = g(m1 )m2 and (m1 m2 )g =
m1 (m2 )g for all g ∈ g, m1 , m2 ∈ M. Then for any homogeneous m1 , m2 ∈ M and g ∈ g
one has
             (ad′ g)(m1 m2 ) = ((ad g)m1 )m2 + (−1)d(g)d(m1 ) m1 ((ad′ g)m2 )
                              = ((ad′ g)m1 )m2 + (−1)d(g)(d(m1 )+1) m1 ((ad g)m2 ).
Moreover if m is ad′ g-invariant then
              (ad′ g)(m1 m) = ((ad g)m1 )m, (ad g)(m1 m) = ((ad′ g)m1 )m.               (1)

2.1.1. Example.        Let N be a U(g)-module and End(N) be the ring of its C-linear
endomorphisms. Then End(N) admits a natural structure of graded U(g)-bimodule. Let
θ be the endomorphism of N which is equal to id (resp., − id) on the even (resp., odd)
component of N. Then θ is an even ad′ g-invariant homomorphism which commutes
with the even elements of End(N) and anticommutes with the odd elements of End(N).
The formulas (1) imply that End(N) considered as ad g-module is isomorphic to End(N)
considered as ad′ g-module. The similar assertion fails for U(g) (the structure of U(g) as
ad′ g-module is given in Lemma 3.1.2).

2.1.2. Let us call anticentre A(g) the set of elements of U(g) which are invariant with
respect to ad′ . Remark that any even element of the anticentre anticommutes with odd
elements of U(g) and commutes with even ones and any odd element of the anticentre
commutes with all elements of U(g). Clearly the anticentre is a module over the centre
and the product of any two elements of the anticentre belongs to the centre. For example,
for g = osp(1, 2l) A(g) is a free rank one module over Z(g) (see [GL], 4.4.1). This is not
true for a general Lie superalgebra.
                           e
  Let us call ghost centre Z(g) the sum of A(g) and Z(g). It is clear that Z(g) e    is a
subalgebra of U(g) which contains the centre of U(g) considered as associative algebra.
                                      e
   In order to describe the action of Z(g) on simple modules, note the following version
of Schur’s lemma for Lie superalgebras

2.1.3. Lemma. Let g be a finite or countable dimensional Lie superalgebra and M =
M0 ⊕ M1 be a simple g-module. Then either End(M)ad g = k id or End(M)ad g = k id ⊕kσ
                                                    ∼
where the odd element σ provides a g-isomorphism M −→ Π(M) and σ 2 = id.

Proof. Assume that φ ∈ End(M)ad g is even. Both homogeneous components M0 and M1
are simple U(g)0 -modules. Since U(g)0 is a complex countable dimensional associative
algebra, the restriction of φ on M0 (resp., on M1 ) is some constant c0 (resp., c1 )— see [BZ].
Since M is simple, c0 = c1 and so φ = c0 id.
   Assume that φ ∈ End(M)ad g is odd. Then φ2 is even and so φ2 = c id for some c ∈ C. If
c = 0 then Ker φ 6= 0 and so√φ = 0. Otherwise φ is invertible and provides a g-isomorphism
     ∼
M −→ Π(M). Set σ = φ/ c. Let ψ be another odd ad g-invariant endomorphism such
that ψ 2 = id. Then (ψ ± σ) are also odd ad g-invariant endomorphisms. Therefore (ψ + σ)
(resp., (ψ − σ)) is either isomorphism or zero. Since (ψ + σ)(ψ − σ) = 0, it implies that
ψ = ±σ. This proves the lemma.

                                                             ′
2.1.4. Using Example 2.1.1, we conclude that End(M)ad g = End(M)ad gθ. This implies
                                             e
the following lemma describing the action of Z(g) on simple modules.
   Lemma. Let g be finite or countable dimensional Lie superalgebra, M = M0 ⊕ M1 be
                                         e
a simple g-module and z be an element of Z(g). Then the action of z on M is proportional
                                                                                        5

                            id,   if   z   ∈ Z(g)   and   z   is   even,
                            0,    if   z   ∈ Z(g)   and   z   is   odd,
                            θ,    if   z   ∈ A(g)   and   z   is   even,
                            σθ,   if   z   ∈ A(g)   and   z   is   odd.

2.2. Case dim g1 is even. In this case all elements of A(g) are even (see 3.1.3). Denote
by Ce the algebra spanned by id and θ. Then C e = C[θ]/(θ 2 − 1). Denote by π the algebra
              e sending θ to −θ.
involution of C
  Definition.                               e
                An algebra homomorphism χ : Z(g)  e is called supercharacter if
                                                 →C
χ(Z(g)) = C and χ(A(g)) ⊆ Cθ.
                  e
  By Lemma 2.1.4, Z(g) acts on a simple modules M by a supercharacter χM . Moreover
χΠ(M ) = πχM .

2.2.1. The standard consequence of Schur’s lemma is the following statement. Any
finite length module M has a unique decomposition into a direct sum of submodules
Mi such that, for any fixed i, all simple subquotients of Mi have the same infinitesimal
character and these characters are pairwise distinct for different i. Similarly, one can
deduce from Lemma 2.1.4, that any finite length module M has a unique decomposition
into a direct sum of submodules Mj such that, for any fixed j, all simple subquotients
of Mj have the same supercharacter and these supercharacters are pairwise distinct for
different j. This new decomposition is a refinement of the previous one. For example,
let L be a simple module such that A(g) does not lie in Ann L. Then L and Π(L) have
different supercharacters. This, for instance, implies that though they have the same
infinitesimal character, there are no non-trivial extensions of L by Π(L).

2.3. Case dim g1 is odd. In this case all elements of A(g) are odd (see 3.1.3). Retain
notation of 2.2. The algebra spanned by id and σθ (see Lemma 2.1.3) is isomorphic to C.e
However if L is a simple module such that aL 6= 0 for some a ∈ A(g), then the product of
                                                                ∼
θ and the image of a in End L provides an isomorphism s : L −→ Π(L). One can choose
a such that s2 = id. There are two possible choices of such s which differ by sign. As a
consequence, in this case, it is more natural to define a odd supercharacter as a pair of
homomorphism (χ, πχ) where χ satisfies the conditions given in Definition 2.2 and π is
                  e sending σθ to −σθ. Observe that if L ∼
the involution of C                                        6= Π(L) then χ = πχ.
   As in 2.2.1, odd supercharacters allows us to construct a decomposition of any module
of finite length, but, probably, it always coincides with the decomposition coming from
the infinitesimal characters.

2.3.1. Example.         Let g1 be generated by x and g0 be generated by [x, x]. Then
U(g) = C[x], Z(g) = C[x2 ] and A(g) = C[x2 ]x is a cyclic Z(g)-module generated by x.
The list of the simple representations of g is the following:
6




  a) Two trivial representations (one is even and one is odd). The corresponding odd
supercharacter sends A(g) to zero.
  b) Two-dimensional representations L(λ) (λ ∈ C \ {0}) spanned
                                                           √     by v and xv where
    2
x v = λv. The corresponding odd supercharacter sends x to ± λσθ. The representations
L(λ) and Π(L(λ)) are isomorphic.

                                   3. Anticentre A(g)

   Retain notation of Section 2. Assume that g = g0 ⊕ g1 is a Lie superalgebra such that
g1 is finite dimensional and Λtop g1 is a trivial g0 -module. In this section we construct a
linear injective map from the centre Z(g0 ) to the anticentre A(g)—see Theorem 3.3. This
allows us to describe the image of A(g) in the symmetric algebra S(g).

3.1. Denote by F the canonical filtration of U(g) given by F k := gk . Recall that this
is an ad g-invariant filtration and that the associated graded algebra grF U(g) = S(g)
is supercommutative. For u ∈ U(g) denote its image in S(g) by gr u. Remark that
(ad′ x)(u) = 2xu − (ad x)(u) for x ∈ g1 and u ∈ U(g). Therefore
        gr((ad′ x)(u)) = 2(gr x)(gr u), ∀u ∈ U(g), x ∈ g1 s.t. gr(xu) = (gr x)(gr u).      (2)

3.1.1. Let L be an even vector space endowed by a structure of g0 -module. Denote by
Indgg0 L the supervector space U(g) ⊗U (g0 ) L (here U(g) is considered as a right U(g0 )-
module) equipped with the natural left U(g)-module structure.
  Let L be a submodule of U(g0 ) with respect to ad g0 -action. Denote by (ad′ g)(L) the
ad′ g-submodule of U(g) generated by L. Note that there is a natural surjective map from
Indgg0 L to (ad′ g)(L) given by u ⊗ m 7→ (ad′ u)m for u ∈ U(g), m ∈ L.

3.1.2. Lemma.        Let L be a submodule of U(g0 ) with respect to ad g0 -action. The
natural map Indg0 L → (ad′ g)(L) is an isomorphism. Moreover U(g) = (ad′ U(g))U(g0 )
                 g

and thus as ad′ g-module U(g) is isomorphic to Indgg0 U(g0 ).
                                                                                      Q
Proof. Let {xi }i∈I be an ordered basis of g1 . For any finite subset J ⊆ I set xJ := i∈J xi ,
where the product is taken with respect to the fixed order. Then the elements {gr xJ }J⊆I
form a basis of Λg1 ⊂ S(g). Choose a basis {uj }j∈S in L such that {gr uj }j∈S are linearly
independent in grF U(g0 ). Using (2) one concludes that gr(ad′ xJ )uj = 2|J| (gr xJ )(gr uj )
for all finite subsets J ⊆ I, j ∈ S. Therefore the elements {(ad′ xJ )uj }J⊆I,j∈S are linearly
independent. This proves the first assertion.
   For the second assertion, note that gr U(g) is spanned by the elements of the form
(gr xJ )(gr u) with u ∈ U(g0 ). Now (gr xJ )(gr u) = gr((ad′ xJ )u)/2|J| and so gr(ad′ U(g))U(g0 ) =
gr U(g). Therefore U(g) = (ad′ U(g))U(g0 ) as required.

The isomorphism U(g) ∼
                     = Indgg0 U(g0 ) is proven in [S2], 3.2.

3.1.3. Corollary.     If g1 has infinite dimension then A(g) = 0. If dim g1 is even, all
elements of A(g) are even and if dim g1 is odd, all elements of A(g) are odd.

Proof. Retain notation of Lemma 3.1.2. Any element of U(g) can be written in a form
        P
u = J (ad′ xJ )uJ where uJ ∈ U(g0 ). Take u 6= 0 and set m = max{|J| | uJ 6= 0}. Assume
that m < dim g1 . Take J such that |J| = m and uJ 6= 0; take i ∈ I \ J. Modulo
P               ′
  |J ′ |<m+1 (ad xJ ′ )U(g0 ) one has
                                              X
                              (ad′ xi )u =          (ad′ xi xJ ′ )uJ ′ 6= 0.
                                             |J ′ |=m

Thus if u ∈ A(g) then m = dim g1 . Since A(g) is a Z2 -graded subspace of U(g), the
assertion follows.


3.2. Ind and Coind. Let L be an even vector space endowed by a structure of left g0 -
module. Denote by Coindgg0 L the supervector space HomU (g0 ) (U(g), L) (here U(g) is
considered as a left U(g0 )-module) equipped with the following left U(g)-module structure:
(uf )(u′) := f (u′ u) for any f ∈ HomU (g0 ) (U(g), L), u, u′ ∈ U(g). The aim of this subsection
is to prove that Indgg0 L and Coindgg0 L (resp., Π(Coindgg0 L) ) are isomorphic if dim g1 is
even (resp., odd).


3.2.1. Retain notation of Lemma 3.1.2. For k ∈ N set
                                                  X
                                   Fok :=                 U(g0 )xJ .
                                              J⊆I,|J|≤k

                                              ′
One has xJ xJ ′ = ±xJ∪J ′ modulo Fo|J|+|J |−1 . This implies that Fop Foq ⊆ Fop+q and thus Fo
is a filtration of U(g). In particular, Fok are U(g0 )-bimodules and the filtration does not
depend from the choice of {xi }i∈I .
   Consider U(g) as a left U(g0 )-module. Denote by ι a g0 -homomorphism from U(g) to
U(g0 ) such that ker ι = Fo|I|−1 and ι(xI ) = 1. Recall that ker ι does not depend from the
choice of basis in g1 . Note that u0 xI = xI u0 modulo Fo|I|−1 for any u0 ∈ U(g0 ), since Λtop g1
is a trivial g0 -module. Thus ι : U(g) → U(g0 ) is a homomorphism of U(g0 )-bimodules.
  Define a map (.|.) from U(g) ⊗U (g0 ) U(g) to U(g0 ) by setting (u|u′) = ι(uu′ ). For any
subsets J, J ′ of I set δJ,J ′ = 1 if J = J ′ and δJ,J ′ = 0 otherwise.


3.2.2. Lemma.            For any J ⊆ I there exist uJ , vJ ∈ U(g) such that (uJ |xJ ′ ) =
(xJ ′ |vJ ) = δJ,J ′ .

Proof. We prove the existence of vJ by induction on r = |I \ J|. For r = 0, J = I and
vI = 1 satisfies the conditions.
8




  Fix J ⊆ I. For any J ′ ⊆ I such that |J ′ | ≤ |J|, one has xJ ′ xI\J = ±xI\J∪J ′ modulo
ker ι = Fo|I|−1. Thus (xJ ′ |xI\J ) = 0 for J 6= J ′ and (xJ |xI\J ) = ±1. Set
                                              X
                              v := xI\J −                vJ ′ (xJ ′ |xI\J ).
                                            |J ′ |>|J|

Then (xJ ′ |v) = 0 for any J ′ ⊆ I, J ′ 6= J and (xJ |v) = ±1. This proves the assertion.
    The existence of uJ can be shown similarly.

3.2.3. Theorem. Assume that g = g0 ⊕ g1 is a Lie superalgebra such that Λtop g1 is a
trivial g0 -module. Then for any g0 -module L the linear map Ψ defined by
                     Ψ(u′ ⊗ m)(u) := (u|u′)m, ∀m ∈ L, u, u′ ∈ U(g)
                                    ∼
provides an isomorphism Indgg0 L −→ Πdim g1 (Coindgg0 L).

Proof. For any u0 ∈ U(g0 ) one has (u|u′u0 )m = ι(uu′ u0 )m = ι(uu′)u0 m = (u|u′)u0 m and
thus φ is well-defined on Indgg0 L = U(g) ⊗U (g0 ) L. Moreover
               Ψ(u′ ⊗ m)(u0 u) = (u0 u|u′)m = u0 (u|u′)m = u0 Ψ(u′ ⊗ m)(u)
and so Ψ(u′ ⊗ m) is a U(g0 )-linear map.
    For any s ∈ U one has
        Ψ(su′ ⊗ m)(u) = (u|su′)m = (us|u′)m = Ψ(u′ ⊗ m)(us) = (sΨ(u′ ⊗ m))(u)
and so Ψ is a homomorphism of left U(g)-modules.
   Since Ψ(1 ⊗ m)(xJ ) = δI,J m, the element Ψ(1 ⊗ m) is even iff xI ∈ U(g) is even. Thus
Ψ is a map from Indgg0 L to Coindgg0 L if dim g1 is even and from Indgg0 L to Π(Coindgg0 L)
if dim g1 is odd.
                                                                   P
   Any element of Indgg0 L can be written in the form J⊆I xJ ⊗ mJ where mJ ∈ L. Fix
                                                           P
J ′ ⊆ I and choose uJ ′ ∈ U(g) as in Lemma 3.2.2. Then Ψ( J⊆I xJ ⊗ mJ )(uJ ′ ) = mJ ′ .
This implies that ker Ψ = 0.
  Fix J ⊆ I and choose vJ ∈ U(g) as in Lemma 3.2.2. Then for any m ∈ L one has
Ψ(vJ ⊗ m)(xJ ′ ) = δJ,J ′ m. This implies the surjectivity of Ψ and completes the proof.

3.3.   Retain notation of Lemma 3.2.2.
  Theorem.         Assume that g = g0 ⊕ g1 is a Lie superalgebra such that Λtop g1 is
a trivial g0 -module. Then the map φ : z 7→ (ad′ v∅ )z provides a linear isomorphism
        ∼
Z(g0 ) −→ A(g). Moreover one has gr φ(z) = x gr z where x is an element of Λtop (g1 ).

Proof. The proof follows from Lemma 3.1.2 and Theorem 3.2.3. We give a full detail
below.
                                                                                                     9




   Denote by ǫe a trivial even representation of g and let e be a non-zero vector of ǫe. There
is a canonical bijection Φ from Homg0 (ǫe, U(g0 )) onto Homg(ǫe, Coindgg0 U(g0 )) given by
                  Φ(ψ)(e)(u) = ψ(ue) ∀ψ ∈ Homg0 (ǫe, U(g0 )), u ∈ U(g).
                                                                     ∼
Combining the map Φ with the natural bijection Z(g0 ) −→ Homg0 (ǫe, U(g0 )), we obtain
the bijection
                               ∼
                  Φ′ : Z(g0 ) −→ Homg(Πdim g1 (ǫe), Coindgg0 U(g0 ))
given by
                                   (Φ′ (z)(e))(xJ ) = δJ,∅ z.
In view of Theorem 3.2.3, Φ′ induces the bijection
                                    ∼
                       Φ′′ : Z(g0 ) −→ Homg(Πdim g1 (ǫe), Indgg0 U(g0 ))
given by
                                     Φ′′ (z)(e) = v∅ ⊗ z.
Finally, Lemma 3.1.2 implies that the map sending z to (ad′ v∅ )z provides a linear iso-
                  ∼
morphism Z(g0 ) −→ A(g) and moreover A(g) lies in U(g)0 if dim g1 is even and in U(g)1
if dim g1 is odd.
                                                                 P
   The proof of Lemma 3.2.2 shows that v∅ = ±xI +                    J6=∅   xI\J dJ where dJ are some
elements of U(g0 ). Therefore
                                                            X
                        φ(z) := (ad′ v∅ )(z) = (ad′ (xI +            cJ xJ ))z                    (3)
                                                            J⊂I
                                                                6=


where cJ are some scalars. By the formula (2), gr φ(z) = x gr z for x := gr xI ∈ Λtop (g1 ).
This completes the proof.

3.4.   The condition on Λtop (g1 ) is essential for both Theorem 3.2.3 and Theorem 3.3.

3.4.1. Example. Let g be the Lie superalgebra W (1) spanned by the even element g
                                                                                   e
and the odd element x subject to the relations [x, x] = 0, [g, x] = x. Then Z(g) = Z(g) =
C and A(g) = 0.

3.4.2. For Theorem 3.2.3 the condition on Λtop is not only sufficient but also necessary.
In fact, assume that the isomorphism Ψ exists for a trivial g0 -module ǫ. Then one has
the following isomorphisms of g0 -modules
                               ∼           ∼                ∼
                         Λg1 −→ Indgg0 ǫ −→ Coindgg0 ǫ −→ (Λg1 )∗ .
                                                                                                 ∼
Thus Λg1 is a self-dual g0 -module. The last is equivalent to the condition Λtop (g1 ) −→ ǫ
if g1 is assumed to be finite dimensional.

                                                                                           ∼
3.4.3. We describe below for which simple Lie superalgebras the condition Λtop (g1 ) −→ ǫ
holds.
   A classification theorem of Kac (see [K1], 4.2.1) states that any complex simple finite
dimensional Lie superalgebra is isomorphic either to one of the classical Lie superalgebra
or to one of the Cartan Lie superalgebras W (n), S(n), S(n),e    H(n).
   Evidently the condition holds if g0 is semisimple or if g1 ∼
                                                              = g∗1 as g0 -module. In particular
the condition holds for all classical Lie superalgebras. It is easy to check that the above
                                                                e
condition holds also for the Cartan Lie superalgebras S(n), S(n),      H(n) and does not hold
for the Cartan Lie superalgebras W (n) with n 6= 2.

3.4.4. Retain the assumption of Theorem 3.3.
     Definition.    Denote by T a non-zero ad′ g-invariant element belonging to (ad′ U(g))(1).

  The element T is defined up to a non-zero scalar and it is even iff dim g1 is even.
Observe that, up to a scalar, T is a unique element of the anticentre whose image in S(g)
belongs to Λtop (g1 ).

3.5. Remarks.

3.5.1. Here we consider U(g) as an associative algebra and denote its centre by Z. Evi-
dently Z ∩ U(g)0 = Z(g) ∩ U(g)0 and Z ∩ U(g)1 = A(g) ∩ U(g)1 . Hence, in the case when
g is finite dimensional,
                       Z = Z(g) ∩ U(g)0               if dim g1 is even,
                       Z = (Z(g) ∩ U(g)0 ) ⊕ A(g)     if dim g1 is odd.

3.5.2. In most of the cases U(g) is not a domain— see [AL]. However, even if U(g) is
a domain (for example g = osp(1, 2l)) the direct generalization of the Gelfand-Kirillov
conjecture does not hold for Lie superalgebras.
  In fact, let k be a field of characteristic zero and An (k) be a Weyl algebra over k. Recall
that the centre of a Weyl skew field Wn (k) coincides with k and that An (k) = An (k) ⊗k k.
Therefore a Weyl skew field does not contain non-central elements whose squares are
central. Take any non-zero a ∈ A(g). If dim g1 is even then a 6∈ Z, but a2 ∈ Z. This
implies that a Weyl skew field and a skew field of fractions of U(g) are not isomorphic if
dim g1 is even and Λtop g1 is a trivial g-module.

                   4. The case of basic classical Lie superalgebras

  In this section g denotes a basic classical Lie superalgebra (see [K2] and 4.1 below) such
that g1 6= 0. In this case the dimension of g1 is even and so all elements of A(g) even. In
                                                                                        11




particular, they anticommute with the odd elements of U(g) and commute with the even
ones.
  In this section we show that the restriction of the Harish-Chandra projection P on
                                                                   e
A(g) is an injection and describe its image. We also prove that Z(g)    coincides with the
centralizer of U(g)0 and with the set of the elements of U(g) acting by superconstants on
each simple finite dimensional module.

4.1. Notation. A finite dimensional simple Lie superalgebra g is called basic classical if
g0 is reductive and g admits a non-degenerate invariant bilinear form. The list of basic
classical Lie superalgebras is the following as determined by Kac (see [K2]):
            a) simple Lie agebras
            b) A(m, n), B(m, n), C(n), D(m, n), D(2, 1, α), F (4), G(3).

  Fix a Cartan subalgebra h in g0 and a triangular decomposition g = n− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ . For
a U(g)-module M and an element µ ∈ h∗ set M|µ = {m ∈ M| hm = µ(h)m, ∀h ∈ h}.
When we use the notation U(g)|µ , the action of g on U(g) is assumed to be the adjoint
action. For µ ∈ h∗ we say that µ is even if U(g)|µ is a non-zero subspace of the even
part of U(g). We say that µ is odd if U(g)|µ is a non-zero subspace of the odd part of
U(g). Since g is a basic classical Lie superalgebra, µ is either even or odd in the case
when U(g)|µ 6= 0.
   The Harish-Chandra projection P : U(g) → S(h) is the projection with respect to the
following triangular decomposition U(g) = U(h) ⊕ (U(g)n+ + n− U(g)) (we identify S(h)
and U(h)). An element a of U(g)|0 acts on a primitive vector of weight µ (µ ∈ h∗ ) by
multiplication by the scalar P(a)(µ). Thus the restriction of P on U(g)|0 = U(g)h is an
algebra homomorphism from U(g)|0 to S(h).
   Denote by ∆0 the set of non-zero even roots of g. Denote by ∆1 the set of odd roots of
g. Set ∆ = ∆0 ∪ ∆1 . Set
                 ∆0:= {α ∈ ∆0 | α/2 6∈ ∆1 },            ∆1:= {β ∈ ∆1 | 2β 6∈ ∆0 }.
Note that ∆1 is the set of isotropic roots. Denote by ∆+ the set of positive roots and
                       ±
define ∆− , ∆±    ±
             0 , ∆1 , ∆0 as usual.

   Denote by W the Weyl group of ∆0 . For any α ∈ ∆0 let sα ∈ W be the corresponding
reflection. Let W ′ be the subgroup of W generated by the reflections sα , α ∈ ∆0 . Note
that W = W ′ iff all odd roots are isotropic. Otherwise (if g is of the type B(m, n) or
G(3)) W ′ is a subgroup of index two.
  Set                             X                     X
                              1                     1

                                                               α, ρ := ρ0 − ρ1 .

Define the translated action of W on h∗ by the formula:
                         w.λ = w(λ + ρ) − ρ, ∀λ ∈ h∗ , w ∈ W.
12




Define the left translated action of W on S(h) by setting w.f (λ) = f (w −1.λ) for any
λ ∈ h∗ .
     Denote by (−, −) a non-degenerate W -invariant bilinear form on h∗ .

4.1.1. For λ ∈ h∗ denote a graded g-Verma module of the highest weight λ by M    f (λ)
where the grading is fixed in such a way that a highest weight vector has degree zero.
By [LM], an element of U(g) annihilating the modules M  f (λ) for λ running through a
                         ∗
Zariski dense subset of h , is equal to zero.
     We use the following result which is a consequence of a theorem of Kac (see [Ja], 2.4)

4.2.1. Lemma. The restriction of the Harish-Chandra projection P provides a linear
injective map A(g) → tS(h)W. .

Proof. Recall that a ∈ U(g)|0 acts on a primitive vector of weight µ (µ ∈ h∗ ) by multi-
plication by the scalar P(a)(µ). Fix a non-zero a ∈ A(g). Since A(g) ⊂ U(g)|0 , a acts
on the even component of M f (λ) by multiplication by the scalar P(a)(λ) and on the odd
component of M f (λ) by multiplication by the opposite scalar. The intersection of the
                                                                                           13




annihilators of all Verma modules is zero (see 4.1.1) and so P(a) is a non-zero polynomial
in S(h).
  Choose a pair (n, α) and an element λ satisfying the assumption of Lemma 4.1.2. Note
                                                                                  +
that nα is even iff α is even. This implies that P(a)(λ) = P(a)(λ − nα) for α ∈ ∆0 and
                                             +                        +
P(a)(λ) = −P(a)(λ − nα) for α ∈ ∆+    1 \ ∆1 . Observe that for α ∈ ∆0 λ − nα = sα .λ
                                                +
and so P(a)(λ) = P(a)(sα .λ). For fixed α ∈ ∆0 the set of λ such that (λ + ρ, α) ∈ N+ is
a Zariski dense subset of h∗ . Thus P(a) ∈ S(h) is W ′ .-invariant.
                       +
  Take α ∈ (∆+                        +
                1 \ ∆1 ). Then 2α ∈ ∆0 and λ − nα = s2α .λ; arguing as above we obtain
that s2α .P(a) = −P(a). In particular, P(a) is divisible by (hα + (ρ, α)).
                   +
   Now take α ∈ ∆1 . Then α is isotropic. In particular, (λ + ρ, α) = 0 implies (λ − α +
ρ, α) = 0. Using Lemma 4.1.2, we conclude that (λ + ρ, α) = 0 implies that P(a)(λ) =
(−1)n P(a)(λ − nα) for any n ∈ N. Therefore P(a)(λ) = 0 if (λ + ρ, α) = 0. Thus P(a) is
divisible by (hα + (ρ, α)).
  Hence P(a) is divisible by (hα + (ρ, α)) for any α ∈ ∆+       1 . This implies that P(a) is
                                                                                           +
divisible by t. Since t is W .-invariant, P(a)/t is also W .-invariant. For any α ∈ (∆+
                            ′                             ′
                                                                                      0 \∆0 ,
both P(a) and t are antiinvariant with respect to the action of sα . Thus P(a)/t is
invariant with respect to the action of sα and so P(a)/t is W.-invariant. This completes
the proof.

4.2.2. Define a filtration on g by setting Fu0 = 0, Fu1 = g1 , Fu2 = g and extend it
canonically to an increasing filtration on U(g). Let z ∈ Z(g0 ) have a degree r with
respect to the canonical filtration. Then, by (3), φ(z) ∈ Fudim g1 +2r and so P(φ(z)) is a
polynomial of degree less than or equal to (dim g1 + 2r)/2 = |∆+     1 | + r. In particular,
                                                          +
P(φ(1)) is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to |∆1 | and so it is equal to t up to
a non-zero scalar. Recall that the map φ depends on the choice of basis {xi }i∈I ; choose a
basis {xi }i∈I such that P(φ(1)) = t.

4.2.3. Fix r ∈ N and set Zr := Z(g0 ) ∩ F r . Denote by Sr the space of W.-invariant
polynomials of degree less than or equal to r. Take z ∈ Zr . Combining Lemma 4.2.1
                                                                           ∼
and 4.2.2, we conclude that (P(φ(zr ))/t) ∈ Sr . Recall that gr Z(g0 ) −→ S(h)W as
graded algebras and so dim Zr = dim Sr . Since φ is a linear isomorphism, it follows that
P(Zr ) = tSr .

4.2.4. Corollary.       The restriction of the Harish-Chandra projection P provides a
linear bijective map A(g) → tS(h)W. . In particular, P(T ) = t.

4.2.5.   Lemma.     Any non-zero element z ∈ A(g) is a non-zero divisor in U(g).

Proof. Assume that zu = 0. Recall that z acts by multiplication by P(z)(λ) (resp.,
                                                       f (λ). Therefore u annihilates
−P(z)(λ)) on the even (resp., odd) graded component of M
14




f (λ) when λ is such that P(z)(λ) 6= 0. Since P(z) 6= 0, the set {λ| P(z)(λ) 6= 0} is a
M
Zariski dense subset of h∗ . By 4.1.1, it implies that u = 0.


4.2.6. Remark. On the contrary to the central elements, gr z is a zero-divisor for any
z ∈ A(g). In fact, by (1) (ad U(g))(z) = (ad′ U(g))(1)z and thus (ad U(g))z contains T z.
Therefore z and T z have the same degree with respect to the canonical filtration and so
gr T gr z = 0. In particular, T 2 is a central element whose degree is equal to dim g1 .


4.2.7.    Corollary.
                                     Z(g) ∩ A(g) = 0.



Proof. For any z ∈ Z(g) ∩ A(g) and any odd element u ∈ g1 one has zu = 0. Hence z = 0
by Lemma 4.2.5.

4.3. The structure of Z(g).                   e

                    ]
sider the algebra S(h) := S(h)[ξ]/(ξ − 1). Define a map P ′ : Z(g)
                                       2                           e        ] by setting
                                                                        → S(h)
                                                                     e
P ′ (z) = P(z) for z ∈ Z(g) and P ′ (z) = P(z)ξ for z ∈ A(g). Since Z(g)  ⊂ U(g)|0 , the re-
                   e
striction of P on Z(g) is an algebra homomorphism. Taking into account Corollary 4.2.4,
we conclude that P ′ provides an algebra isomorphism from Z(g)   e     onto the subalgebra
                   W.     ]
(P(Z(g)) ⊕ tS(h) ξ) of S(h).


4.3.1. Assume that g is of the type B(m, n) or G(3). Then W ′ 6= W and so t is not W.-
invariant. Therefore P(A(g)) ∩ P(Z(g)) = {0}. Then, using Corollary 4.2.4, we conclude
that the restriction of the Harish-Chandra projection provides an algebra isomorphism
 e
Z(g)  ∼
      = (P(Z(g)) ⊕ tS(h)W. ).
     In all other cases, P(A(g)) ⊂ P(Z(g)).


4.3.2. In the case when g = osp(1, 2l), Z(g) is a polynomial algebra and A(g) is a cyclic
Z(g) module generated by T . In other cases (when g is basic classical Lie superalgebra)
this does not hold. However, a similar result hold after a certain localization.
   More precisely, if g 6= osp(1, 2l) (that is g is not of the type B(0, l)) then P(Z(g))
is strictly contained in S(h)W. . However, since the product of two elements from the
anticentre belongs to the centre, P(Z(g)) contains t2 S(h)W. . Set Q := T 2 , q := t2 . Then
                                                                                e

4.4. The action of Z(g)    on the simple modules. Let us say that an element u ∈ U(g)
acts on a U(g)-module M by a superconstant if it acts by a multiplication by a scalar on
each graded component of M. By 2.2, each element of Z(g)  e    acts by a superconstant on
any simple module. In this subsection we shall prove that actually Z(g)e    coincides with
the set of elements of U(g) which act by superconstants on each simple finite dimensional
                    e
module. Moreover Z(g)    coincides with the centralizer of the even part U(g)0 in U(g).

                       e
4.4.1. By definition, Z(g)  lies in the centralizer of U(g)0 in U(g) and even in the centre
                                e
of U(g)0 since all elements of Z(g)  are even.
  Let A be a centralizer of U(g)0 in U(g) and a be an element of A. Clearly, a acts by a
superconstant on any Verma module. On the even component of M(λ)f    a acts by P(a)(λ).
                           ∗
Let f (a) be the function h → k such that a acts by f (a)(λ) on the odd component of
f (λ).

4.4.2.   Lemma.     For any a ∈ A the function f (a) : h∗ → k is polynomial.

Proof. Choose y ∈ n−            +
                    1 and x ∈ n1 such that h := [y, x] ∈ S(h) and h 6= 0. For each µ ∈ h
                                                                                         ∗
                                    f (µ). Then yv is odd and so
choose a highest weight vector vµ ∈ M               µ

                         xayvµ = f (a)(µ)xyvµ = f (a)(µ)h(µ)vµ .
Since xay ∈ U(g)|0 one has xayvµ = P(xay)(µ)vµ . Thus
                                f (a)(µ)h(µ) = P(xay)(µ).                               (4)
This implies that P(xay)(µ) vanishes on the whole hyperplane {µ| h(µ) = 0}. Therefore
h divides P(xay)(µ) and so f (a) = P(xay)/h is a polynomial.

4.4.3. Lemma 4.4.2 implies that an element a ∈ A acts by P(a)(λ) on the even com-
ponent of Mf (λ) and by f (λ) on the odd component of M   f (λ). Arguing as in 4.2.1, we
              ′                                  W.
obtain that P := P(a) − f (a) belongs to tS(h) . Similarly, P := P(a) + f (a) belongs to
                                      +
S(h)W. and moreover for any α ∈ ∆1 one has P (λ − α) = P (λ) if (λ + ρ, α) = 0. By [S1]
and Corollary 4.2.4, this implies that P = P(z) for some z ∈ Z(g) and P ′ = P(z ′ ) for
some z ′ ∈ A(g). Then a − (z + z ′ )/2 kills any Verma module and so a = (z + z ′ )/2. This
             e
proves that Z(g) = A.
  The intersection of the annihilators of all simple highest weight modules is equal to
zero (see 4.1.1). This implies that the set of elements of U(g) acting by superconstants
on each graded simple finite dimensional module coincides with A. Hence we obtain

4.4.4. Corollary.     If g is a basic classical Lie superalgebra then the following algebras
coincide
   i) The algebra of elements of U(g) which act by superconstants on each graded simple
finite dimensional module.

     ii) The algebra Z(g).
     iii) The centre of U(g)0 .
     iv) The centralizer of U(g)0 .

4.5. A remark concerning the separation theorem. An important structure theo-
rem of Kostant asserts that for any finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebra there exists
an ad g-submodule H of U(g) such that the multiplication map induces the isomorphism
            ∼
H ⊗ Z(g) −→ U(g). In [Mu], I. Musson proved the similar assertion for g = osp(1, 2l).
These theorems are called the separation theorems. We shall show that Separation theo-
rem does not hold for any basic classical Lie superalgebra apart from finite dimensional
simple Lie algebras and g = osp(1, 2l).

4.5.1. Denote by V (resp., Ve ) a trivial representation of g0 (resp., g).
  Lemma. Assume that g1 contains a non-zero element x such that [x, x] = 0. Then
the trivial submodule Ve is not a direct summand of Indgg0 V .

Proof. Denote a generator of V ⊂ Indgg0 V by v and a generator of the trivial submodule
of Indgg0 V by v ′ . Retain notation of 3.3. Choose an ordered basis {xi }i∈I of g1 in such a
                                     P
way that [x1 , x1 ] = 0. Write v ′ = J⊂I cJ xJ ⊗ v where cJ ∈ C. One has x1 xJ = 0 when
1 ∈ J and x1 xJ = x{1}∪J otherwise. Since x1 v ′ = 0, this implies that c∅ = 0.
  Recall that Homg(Indgg0 V, Ve ) is one-dimensional and is spanned by an element f such
that f (V ) 6= 0 and f (U(g)gV ) = 0. Thus f (v ′ ) = 0 and so the trivial submodule Ve is not
a direct summand of Indgg0 V .

4.5.2. Let g be a basic classical Lie superalgebra which is neither simple Lie algebra nor
osp(1, 2l). Then g1 contains a non-zero element x such that [x, x] = 0. From (1) it follows
that the multiplication by T gives a g-map from the ad′ g-module generated by 1 onto the
ad g-module generated by T . Since T is a non-zero divisor, this map is an isomorphism.
In particular, T 2 ∈ (ad U(g))T and (ad U(g))T ∼= Indgg0 V where V is a trivial g0 -module.
Using Lemma 4.5.1, we conclude that T 2 spans a trivial ad g-submodule of U(g) which
is not a direct summand. On the other hand, 1 spans a trivial ad g-submodule of U(g)
which is a direct summand, since U(g) = C ⊕ U(g)g as ad g-module.
   Assume now that Separation theorem holds for U(g). Then Z(g) ∼         = (H)g ⊗ Z(g)
                                  g
as Z(g)-module. Therefore (H) is one-dimensional. Thus all trivial ad g-submodules
of U(g) are either direct summands or are not direct summands of U(g). This gives a
contradiction.

5.1. The centralizer of U(g)0 contains Z(g).   Do they coincide provided that Λtop g1 is a
trivial g0 -module? Note that the condition on Λtop g1 is essential— see Example 3.4.1.

5.2. Let C be the set of the elements of U(g) which act by a superconstant on each

even. Assume that dim g1 is even and that the intersection of all graded primitive ideals
                                          e
of U(g) is zero. Does this imply that C = Z(g)?

5.3. In the case when g is a basic classical Lie superalgebra both answers are positive—
see Corollary 4.4.4.
