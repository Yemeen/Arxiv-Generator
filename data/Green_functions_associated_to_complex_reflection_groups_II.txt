                                                   Abstract. Green functions associated to complex reflection groups G(e, 1, n) were
                                                   discussed in the author’s previous paper. In this paper, we consider the case of com-
                                                   plex reflection groups W = G(e, p, n). Schur functions and Hall-Littlewood functions
                                                   associated to W are introduced, and Green functions are described as the transition
                                                   matrix between those two symmetric functions. Furthermore, it is shown that these
                                                   Green functions are determined by means of Green functions associated to various
                                                   G(e′ , 1, n′ ). Our result involves, as a special case, a combinatorial approach to the
                                                   Green functions of type Dn .



                                                                                  0. Introduction
                                                This paper is a continuation of [S]. In [S], Hall-Littlewood functions associated to
                                            the complex reflection group G(e, 1, n) were introduced. Green functions associated
                                            to G(e, 1, n) are defined as a solution of a certain matrix equation arising from the
                                            combinatorics of e-symbols. It was shown that such Green functions are obtained as
                                            coeffcients of the expansion of Schur functions in terms of Hall-Littlewood functions.
                                            In the case where e = 2, G(e, 1, n) coincides with the Weyl group of type Bn , and
                                            the Green function in that case coincides with the Green function associated to finite
                                            classical groups Sp2n (Fq ) or SO2n+1 (Fq ) introduced by Deligne-Lusztig, in a geometric
                                            way. So our resut is regarded as a first step towards the combinatorial description of
                                            such Green functions, just as in the case of Green polynomials of GLn (Fq ).
                                                In this paper, we take up the complex reflection group G(e, p, n), and show that
                                            a similar formalism as in the case of G(e, 1, n) works also for such groups. In the case
                                            of G(e, p, n), symmetric functions such as Schur functions, Hall-Littlewood functions,
                                            etc. appear as p-tuples of similar functions associated to the various complex reflec-
                                            tion groups G(e′ , 1, n′ ). In particular, Green functions associated to G(e, p, n) can be
                                            described in terms of Green functions associated to G(e′ , 1, n′ ). In the case where
                                            e = p = 2, the group G(e, p, n) is equal to the Weyl group of type Dn . In this case
                                            our Green functions coincide with the Green functions associated to the finite groups
                                            SO2n (Fq ) of split type or non-split type. So our result implies, in this case, that the
                                            Green functions of type Dn can be described completely in terms of various “Green
                                            functions” of type Bn′ . However, note that the Green function of type Bn′ appearing
                                            in this context is not the Green function associated to SO2n′ +1 . They are the functions
                                            introduced in [S], associated to different type of symbols.
                                                                                             1

    In the case where n = 2, the group G(e, e, n) is equal to the dihedral group of
degree 2e. In this case, our Green function coincides with the function obtained by
Geck-Malle [GM] in connection with special pieces and unipotent characters of finite
reductive groups (see [L2]).

                     1. Schur-Weyl reciprocity for G(e, p, n)

     1.1. Let W    f ≃ Sn ⋉(Z/eZ)n be the imprimitive complex reflection group G(e, 1, n)
acting on the complex vector space Cn . Let e1 , . . . , en be the standard basis of Cn .
Then W f is realized as a subgroup of GL(Cn ) consisting of w such that w(ei ) = ξi ex(i)
for i = 1, . . . , n, where x ∈ Sn and ξi is an e-th root of unity (depending on w). We
fix a primitive e-th root of unity ζ. Then ξi = ζ ai with ai ∈ Z/eZ, and w ∈ W        f can be
written as w = x(a1 , . . . , an ) uniquely. The complex reflection group W0 = G(e, e, n)
is defined as the subgroup of W    f consisting of w ∈ W f such that Pn ai ≡ 0 (mod e).
                                                                        i=1
W0 is a normal subgroup of W      f of index e. Let us define, for k = 0, . . . , e − 1, tk ∈ W
                                                                                              f
by
                                            (
                                              ζek   if i = k,
                                 tk (ei ) =
                                              ei    otherwise.
                                                    Q                                      f
Then w = x(a1 , . . . , an ) can be written as w = x ni=1 tai i . Hence if we put σ = t1 , W
is a semidirect product of W0 with the cyclic group of order e generated by σ. For
each factor pPof e, we put W = W0 ⋊hσ p i. Then W is the subgroup of W       f consisting of
                n
w such that i=1 ai ≡ 0 (mod p), and is isomorphic to the complex reflection group
G(e, p, n).
     1.2.    For a factor p of e, we put d = e/p. Let Pn,e be the set of e-tuples
                                                 Pe−1 (k)
α = (α , . . . , α(e−1) ) of partitions such that k−0
         (0)
                                                      |α | = n. An element α ∈ Pn,e
                                                 Pe−1
is called an e-partition of n. We put l(α) = k=0 l(α(k) ), where l(α(k) ) denotes the
number of parts of the partition α(k) . Let us define an operator θ = θp on Pn,e by
θ(α) = (α(k−d) ) for α = (α(k) ) ∈ Pn,e . We denote by cα,p the number of elements in
the θ-orbit of α. Then the irreducible representations of W are described as follows.
                                                                                 f is
It is known that the set of isomorphism classe of irreducible representations of W

parametrized by Pn,e . Let Zα be an irreducible W
Then Zα is decomposed, as a W -module, as
                                           p              p
(1.2.1)                              Zα = Zα,1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Zα,r ,
                                                                     p
where r = p/cα,p , and σ permutes factors in a cyclic way. Each Zα,i    is an irreducible
W -module, mutually non-isomorphic of the same dimension. Furthermore, if α and
β are in the same orbit under θ, then Zα ≃ Zβ as W -modules. We denote by χα the
                         f afforded by Zα, and by χα,i the irreducible character of W
irreducible character of W                              p
              p
afforded by Zα,i for i = 1, . . . , p/cα,p . We write α ∼p β if α and β are in the same
θ-orbit, and by Pn,e /∼p the set of θ-orbits in Pn,e . Then the set W ∧ of irreducible
characters of W is parametrized as

(1.2.2)                  W ∧ = {χα,i
                                 p | α ∈ Pn,e /∼p , 1 ≤ i ≤ p/cα,p }.



       1.3. Here we recall the Schur-Weyl reciprocity                            f and a cetaiin Levi
                                                                      Lbetween
                                                                         e−1
                                                                                 W
subgroup of a general linear group over C. Let V = i=0 Vi be a vector space over C
                                                          (k)
with dim Vi = mi . We fix a basis E = {vj | 1 ≤ j ≤ mk } of Vk for 0 ≤ k ≤ e − 1.
             (0)     (0)  (1)            (1)
Then v1 , . . . , vm0 , v1 P  , . . . , vm1 , . . . gives a basis of V , which we write in this order as
v1 , . . . , vM with M =           mi . Let G = GLm0 × · · · × GLme−1 . Here GLmi acts on Vi
in a natural way. Hence we have an action of G on V , and so on the n-fold tensor
space V ⊗n . On the other hand, Sn acts on V ⊗n by permuting the factors of the tensor
product. This action commutes with the action of G. We extend the action of Sn to
that of W     f as follows: For a basis element v = vi ⊗ · · · ⊗ vin in V , we put
                                                                 1


                                             tk (v) = ζ j v

                                                                                  f , commuting
if vik ∈ Vj . Then this action of t1 , . . . , tn on V gives rise to an action of W
with the action of G. It is known that the following Schur-Weyl reciprocity holds (e.g.,
see [SS], where the Hecke algebra version is discussed).
(1.3.1) Let σ1 : CWf → End V ⊗n , ρ1 : CG → End V ⊗n be the representations of W   f and
G, respectively, (CWf , etc. denote the group algebra of W f , etc. over C). Then σ1 (CW
                                                                                       f)
                                                                    ⊗n
and ρ1 (CG) are the centralizer algebras of each other in End V . More precisely, the
following holds. Put m = (m0 , . . . , me−1 ), and let Λm be the set of α ∈ Pn,e such that
                     f × G-module V ⊗n is decomposed as
l(α(i) ) ≤ mi . Then W
                                           M
                                 V ⊗n =          Zα ⊗ Vα ,
                                               α∈Λm


                            f -module as before, and Vα is an irreducible G-module
where Zα is the irreducible W
                                                                               f -modules
with highest weight α. In particular, if mi ≥ n for any i, all the irreducible W
are realized in V ⊗n .
    1.4. We shall extend the Schur-Weyl reciprocity to the case of W . Here we pose
the following assumption on m.
4                                             T. SHOJI

(1.4.1) mk = mk+d for k = 0, 1, . . . , p − 1 in m = (m0 , . . . , me−1 ).

                                                                         (k)        (k+d)
    Let us define a linear automorphism τ = τp on V by τ (vj ) = vj   for 1 ≤ j ≤ mk
and for integers k (here we regard k ∈ Z/eZ). Then τ is an element of GLM of order
p, and normalizes the subgroup G. We denote by G   e the subgroup of GLM generated
by G and τ , which is isomorphic to the semidirect product G ⋊hτ i, where τ acts on
G = GLm0 × · · · × GLme−1 by τ (GLmk ) = GLmk+d . Now we have an action of G    e on
  ⊗n                      ⊗n
V , where τ acts on V        by
                           (k )            (k )        (k +d)              (k +d)
                       τ (vi1 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vin n ) = vi1 1       ⊗ · · · ⊗ vin n     .

We denote this action also by ρ1 . Here ρ1 (τ ) is an automorphism of order p on V ⊗n ,
commuting with the action of Sn . Moreover, we have τ στ −1 = ζ −dσ on V ⊗n , and so
ρ1 (τ ) normalizes the subalgebra ρ1 (CWf) of End V ⊗n . It is easy to check, for w ∈ Wf,
that σ1 (w) commutes with ρ1 (τ ) if and only if w ∈ W . Thus we have an action of W ×G  e
       ⊗n
on V . We consider the decomposition of V          ⊗n                              ∼ Vθ(α) ,
                                                       as in (1.3.1). Since τ (Vα) −
                                                                                   →
τ maps Zα ⊗ Vα onto Zθ(α) ⊗ Vθ(α) . Here we may choose, as a model of Zα in V ⊗n ,
the space of highest weight vectors with highest weight α in V ⊗n . Then we have
τ (Zα) = Zθ(α) . Put Γ =< τ >≃ Z/pZ, and let Γα be the stabilizer of Zα in Γ . Then
Zα = hτ c i with c = cα,p , and Zα turns out to be a Γα-module. For each φ ∈ Γα∧ , we
denote by Zα,φ the φ-isotropic subspace of Zα, which is stable by W . Now σ permutes
factors Zα,φ transitively, and |Γα| = p/cα,p . It follows that each Zα,φ becomes an
irreducible W -module and
                                            M
                                      Zα =        Zα,φ
                                                  φ∈Γα∧


gives the decomposition of Zα into irreducible W -modules given in (1.2.1). On the

other hand, let Vα,φ  be a G-submodule of V ⊗n generated by a highest weight vector

G-module.  Moreover, Vα,φ are mutually non-isomorphic for distinct pairs (α, φ). Put

we have the following Schur-Weyl reciprocity between W and G.   e

                        2. Frobenius formula for G(e, p, n)

    2.1. In the remainder of this paper, we assume that m = (m0 , . . . , me−1 ) satisfies
the condition (1.4.1) and the condition that mi ≥ n for i = 0, . . . , e − 1. Then
any irreducicible W -module is realized as Zα,φ by Proposition 1.5. In this case, Λpm
coincides with the set

                          PeW = {(α, φ) | α ∈ Pn,e /∼p , φ ∈ Γα∧ }.

We denote by χα,φ the irreducible character of W corresponding to the W -module
Zα,φ . Under this notation, the parametrization of W ∧ in (1.2.2) can be modified as

(2.1.1)                                               eW }.
                               W ∧ = {χα,φ | (α, φ) ∈ P

    For later use, we consider a more general situation. Assume that q is a factor of
e and that hσ q i×hσ p i is a subgroup of hσi ≃ Z/eZ, i.e., e/q and e/p are prime each
other. The typical case is that W = W0 and q is any factor of e. Now one can form a
semidirect product hσ q i⋉W as a subgroup of W    f . We are now interested in the set of
 q                           ∧
σ -stable characters in W . It follows from the discussion in 1.4 that the irreducible
W -module Zα,φ is σ q -stable if and only if q is divisible by |Γα| = p/cα,p . So we put

                       PeW
                         q
                           = {(α, φ) ∈ PeW | qcα,p ≡ 0 (mod p)}.

We also write it as P  eq                                                           ∧
                        n,e,p to make the dependence on n, e, p more explicit. Let Wex,q
be the set of σ q -stable irreducible characters of W . Thus Wex,q
                                                               ∧
                                                                   is given as

(2.1.2)                     ∧
                           Wex,q                          eq }.

     2.2. As in [S], we identify Pn,e with the set Zn0,0 = Zn0,0 (m). Here Zn0,0 is the set
                                                                                   (k)
of e-partitions α written as α = (α(0) , . . . , α(e−1) ) with a partition α(k) : α1 ≥ · · · ≥
 (k)                                              (k)
αmk ≥ 0. We prepare the indeterminates xi for 0 ≤ k < e, 1 ≤ i ≤ mk . We write
        (k)                             (k)           (k)
x = {xi }, and also write as x(k) = {x1 , . . . , xmk } for a fixed k. Recall that a power
sum symmetric function pα(x) is defined for α ∈ Zn0,0 as
                                                  mk

    It is known that the set of conjugacy classes in Wf is in bijection with Pn,e . The
explicit correspondence will be given later in 2.3. We denote by wβ a representative
of the conjugacy class in Wf corresponding to β ∈ Pn,e . Then the Frobenius formula
                                  f is given as follows.
for the irreducible characters of W
                               f ). Let β ∈ Pn,e . Then we have
(2.2.3) (Frobenius formula for W

     2.3.     We want to generalize (2.2.3) to the case of irreducible characters on
    q
σ W . First of all we describe the conjugacy classes in W       f and W more precisely. The
correspondence between the conjugacy classes in W            f and Pn,e is given explicitly as
follows. Assume that w maps ei1 , ei2 , . . . , eim in a cyclic way, up to scalar, and leaves
other ej unchanged. If w m (ei1 ) = ζ k ei1 , we say that w is a k-cycle (i1 , . . . , im ) of
length m. Now w ∈ W        f can be written as a product of various disjoint cycles. If we
group up, for a fixed k, the k-cycles among them, it produces a partition α(k) , and
α = (α(0) , . . . , α(e−1) ) turns out to be an e-partition of n. This gives the required
bijection. We denote by Cα the conjugacy class of W          f corresponding to α ∈ Pn,e .
                    (0)       (e−1)
     For α = (α , . . . , α         ) ∈ Pn,e , we define an integer ∆(α) by
                                                      e−1
                                                      X
(2.3.1)                                  ∆(α) =             l(α(k) )k.
                                                      k=0

It is easily checked taht the conjugacy class Cα belongs to W if and only if ∆(α) ≡ 0
(mod p). The class Cα is decomposed into several conjugacy classes in W .
     More generally, we consider a coset σ q W in W f . Then σ q W is invariant under the
                  f, and the class Cα lies in σ q W if and only if ∆(α) ≡ q (mod p). The
adjoint action of W
conjugacy class Cα ⊂ σ q W is also decomposed into several W -orbits. The complete
description of such W -orbits will be given in Proposition 2.13.
        2.4. Let D be an operator on V ⊗n defined by

                D(vi1 ⊗ vi2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vin ) = xi1 xi2 · · · xin (vi1 ⊗ vi2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vin ).

                                                                                                (k)
(Although we must replace V by the scalar extension K ⊗C V with K = C(xj ), we
use the same notation by abbreviation). Then D commutes with the action of W  f,
                                                                              ⊗n
and the Frobenius formula (2.2.3) is obtained by computing the trace Tr (Dw, V )

for w ∈ Wf in two different ways. We follow this strategy to establish the Frobenius
formula for the characters of W , in our case by computing the traces Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n )
for j = 0, . . . , p − 1.
    For an integer j (0 ≤ j < p), let hj be order of the image j̄ of j in Z/pZ. Then p is
written as p = hj j1 , where j1 is the greatest common divisor of j and p. We introduce
                                (k)
new indeterminates Xj = {Xi } by
              (k)      (k) (k+jd) (k+2jd)                (k+(h−1)jd)
(2.4.1)    Xi       = xi xi      xi            · · · xi                        (0 ≤ k < j1 d, 1 ≤ i ≤ mk ),

with h = hj . We write also as Xj = {X1 , . . . , Xmk } for a fixed k. One can define a
           (i)                                          (0)          (j d−1)
function pr (Xj ) with respect to the variables Xj = {Xj , . . . , Xj 1      } by modifying
(2.2.2) as follows.
                                                     j1 d−1
                                                         X               (k)
(2.4.2)                               p(i)
                                       r (Xj )   =              ζ ik pr (Xj ).
                                                         k=0

    Then we have the following lemma.


Lemma 2.5. Let w ∈ W       f be an f -cycle of length n. Assume that w is of the form
     a b
w = t1 tn z, where z is a cyclic permutation (1, 2, . . . , n) ∈ Sn and a + b ≡ f (mod p).
Then, for each j such that 0 ≤ j < p,
                                  (
                                                 (f )
                                   hζ −(f +b)jd pn/h (Xj )     if h | n and h | f ,
             Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n ) =

where h = hj as before.


Proof. We have
             (k )     (k )              (k )                          (k +jd)        (k +jd)             (k       +jd)
      τ j w(vi1 1 ⊗ vi2 2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vin n ) = ζ akn +bkn−1 vin n                 ⊗ vi1 1       ⊗ · · · ⊗ vin−1
                                                                                                            n−1
                                                                                                                         .

                                                                                   (k )         (k )
Now assume that Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n ) 6= 0. Then there exists vi1 1 , . . . , vin n ∈ E satisfying
the relation
                               (k )      (k    +jd)
                              vis s = vis−1
                                         s−1
                                                                 for s = 1, . . . , n.

(Here we regard vi0 = vin , and k0 = kn ). This implies that
                               (k )      (k +njd)
(2.5.1)                       vi1 1 = vi1 1          ,
                               (k )      (k +(s−1)jd)
                              vis s = vi1 1                      for s = 2, . . . , n.

In particular, we have njd ≡ 0 (mod e), or equivalently nj ≡ 0 (mod p).
8                                               T. SHOJI

    Under the notation in (2.4.1), we have
                                                    j1 d−1 h−1                 mk
                                                     XX                        X        (k)
(2.5.2)        Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n ) = ζ −(a+2b)jd                  ζ f (k+sjd)         (Xi )n/h .
                                                     k=0 s=0                   i=1


This implies that Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n ) = 0 unless f j ≡ 0 (mod p). Here note that the
condition nj ≡ 0 (mod p) is equivalent to h | n, and similarly for f j ≡ 0 (mod p).
The second assertion follows from this.
   We now assume that nj ≡ 0 and f j ≡ 0 (mod p). Then by (2.4.2) and (2.5.2), we
have
                                                                     (f )
                           Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n ) = hζ −(a+2b)jd pn/h (Xj ).

This shows the first assertion, and the lemma is proved.



                                                                    f. We fix j and

                                           (k)
let h = hj and j1 be as before. For α = (αi ), we consider the following condition

Assume that α ∈ Pn,e satisfies (2.6.1). We define a j1 d-partition β = (β (0) , . . . , β (j1 d−1) )
             (k/h)     (k)             (k)
of n/h by βi       = αi /h for any αi such that h | k. We write β as β = α[j]. Then
we have h∆(α[j]) = ∆(α). Note that in this situation (2.4.2) can be regarded as
a formula analogous to (2.2.2) for variables Xj , by replacing ζ by ζ h. Thus one can
define pα[j](Xj ) just as in (2.2.1) as a product of various pβ (k) (Xj ).
                                                                    i
    As in 2.3, w can be written as a product of various cycles associated to α. Under
the conjugation in W , w is changed to an element w ′ of the following type; the cycle
                     (k)                                                                       (k)
corresponding to αi is of the form tki1 z, where z = (i1 , i2 , . . . , im ) ∈ Sm with m = αi ,
except one cycle. The excepted one is of the form tai1 tbim z, where z = (i1 , i2 , . . . , im )
with a + b ≡ k (mod e). We may further assume that each cyclic permutation z
occuring in the decomposition of w ′ is of the form z = (i1 , i1 + 1, . . . , i1 + (m − 1)).
We write this element as w ′ = wα(b).
    Note that Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n ) remain unchanged if w is replaced by its conjugate w ′ ,
since W commutes with D and τ . Then Tr (Dτ j w ′ , V ⊗n ) can be computed by making
use of Lemma 2.5. So, as a corollary to Lemma 2.5, we have

Proposition 2.7. Assume that w ∈ Cα in W      f , and that w is conjugate under W to
wα(b). Then Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n ) = 0 unless α satisfies the condition (2.6.1). If α satisfies
the condition (2.6.1), then

                       Tr (Dτ j w, V ⊗n ) = hl(α[j])ζ −(∆(α)+b)jd pα[j] (Xj ).

   2.8.    Next, we consider the decomposition V ⊗n =      Vα,φ ⊗ Zα,φ as given in
Proposition 1.5. Assume that w ∈ σ q W . If χα,φ ∈ W ∧ is not σ q -stable, then Dτ j w
maps Vα,φ ⊗ Zα,φ onto a different factor. It follows that

      Let χα,φ be a σ q -stable irreducible character of W . Then χα,φ can be extended
to an irreducible character of hσ q i⋉W ≃ We,p′,n , where p′ = pq/e. Let Γ ′ ≃ Z/p′ Z
be the subgroup of Γ ≃ Z/pZ generated by τ e/q , and Γα′ the stabilizer of Zα in Γ ′ .
Since q is divisible by |Γα| by (2.1.2) and since (e/p, e/q) = 1, we see that Γα′ coincides
with Γα. Hence Irreducible characters of W occuring in the decomposition of χα are
also regarded as irreducible characters of We,p′,n . In this way, we can fix an extension
eα,φ of χα,φ to We,p′,n . Accordingly, the irreducible W -module Zα,φ is extended to the
χ
irreducible We,p′ ,n -module corresponding    L to χ eα,φ , which we denote by Zeα,φ .

      Remember that Vα,φ ⊗ Zα,φ ≃                β∈O(α) Vβ,φ ⊗ Zβ,φ as G × W -module, and τ

each summand Vβ,φ          ⊗ Zβ,φ stable. The last space is extended to a We,p′,n -module

      Assume that α ∈ Pn,e satisfies the condition that cα,p | j. We put α{j} =
(α , . . . , α(j1 d−1) ). Since j1 d is divisible by cα,p , α{j} turns out to be a j1 d-partition

of n/h. Also note that, τ j ∈ Γα. Under this setting, We have the following lemma.

Lemma 2.9. Let α ∈ Pn,e , and q be as in 2.1. Assume that χα,φ is σ q -stable. Then
for w ∈ σ q W , we have

where c = cα,p , and sα{j} (Xj ) etc. are Schur functions given in 2.2 with resepect to
the variables Xj .

Proof. By the previous remark, Dτ j w permutes the factors Vβ,φ     ′
                                                                        ⊗ Zβ,φ if j is not a
multiple of c, and so Tr (Dτ w, Vα,φ ⊗ Zeα,φ ) = 0. Now assume that c | j. Then we can

      In fact, Vβ,1 is an irreducible G-module isomorphic to Vβ, and it is known from
(2.2.3) that Tr (D, Vβ) = sβ(x). Vβ has a basis consisting of weight vectors, on which
                                                     (k )              (k )
D acts diagonally. Here for a vector v = vi1 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vin n ∈ V ⊗n , the weight of v
                                                                               (k)
is given by an elemenet γ(v) = (γ (0) , . . . , γ (e−1) ) ∈ Zn0,0 , where γi is the number of
  (k)
vi occuring in the expression of v. On the other hand, τ j acts on Vβ, by permuting
the weight vectors; if v is a weight vector with weight γ, then τ j (v) is also a weight
vector with weight γ ′ = (γ (−jd) , γ (1−jd) , . . . , γ (e−1−jd) ). Hence, in order to compute
Tr (Dτ j , Vβ ), we have only to consider the weight vectors in Vβ whose weights are
                        (k)
of the type γ = (γi ) such that γ (k) = γ (k+jd) for each k. Note that monomials
Q (k) γ (k)
   (xi ) i obtained as weights of D produce the Schur function sβ(x). Then the
                                                  Q (k) (k)
corresponding weight for Dτ j is given by (Xi )γi for γ as above (the product is
taken for k such that 0 ≤ k < j1 d). Hence Tr (Dτ j , Vβ,1       ′
                                                                    ) is obtained by picking up the
                                         Qe−1                (k)
monomials of this type from sβ (x) = k=0 sβ(k) (x ), which coinicdes with sβ{j} (Xj ).
This proves (2.9.1).
      To prove the lemma, it is enough to show that
                                     i
(2.9.2)                            eθ (α),φ (w) = ζ qid χ

                                                             i
for i = 0, . . . , c−1. We show (2.9.2). Since χ          eθ (α),φ are both extensions of χα,φ ,
                                                 eα,φ and χ
                                                                             i
there exists a linear character ϕ of the cyclic group hσ q i such that χ   eθ (α),φ = ϕ ⊗ χ
                                                                                          eα,φ .

On the other hand, since τ στ            = ζ σ on V , we see that the action of σ q on
                                             −d        ⊗n

Zeθi (α),φ = τ i (Zeα,φ ) corresponds, under the isomorphism τ i of W -modules, to the action
of σ q on Zeα,φ multiplied by ζ qid. This implies (2.9.2), and the lemma follows.


     2.10. In order to formulate the Frobenius formula for the σ q -stable characters of
W , we shall define Schur functions and power sum symmetric functions associated to
σ q W . Let (α, φ) ∈ Peq , and put, for each 0 ≤ j < p,
                       W

where c = cα,p . We put sα,φ (x) = (sjα,φ (x))0≤j<p , and call it Schur function for σ q W
associated to (α, φ).
    Next, we consider power sum symmetric functions. For a pair (α, b), where α ∈
Pn,e and 0 ≤ b < e, and for 0 ≤ j < p, we put
                          (
                j           hl(α[j])ζ −(∆(α)+b)jd pα[j](Xj ) if α satisfies (2.6.1),
(2.10.2)       pα,b (x) =
                            0                                otherwise.

(For the notation, see 2.6.) We put pα,b (x) = (pjα,b(x))0≤j<p , and call it a power sum
symmetric function for σ q W associated to the pair (α, b).
     We are now ready to formulate a Frobenius formula for the characters on σ q W as
follows. The proof is immediate from Proposition 2.7, (2.8.1) and Lemma 2.9.

polynomials of degree i. We can define a space of symmetric functions Ξ = i≥0 Ξi ,
where Ξi is the inverse limit of Ξim (cf. [loc. cit.]). For α ∈ Pn,e , the functions sα(x),
                                                                         (k)  (k)
pα(x) given in 2.2 make sense for infinietely many variables x1 , x2 , . . . , and give rise

     Schur functions sα,φ (x) and power sum symmetric functions pβ,b (x) defined in

be regarded as elements in the space              pΞnC , the direct sum of p copies of C ⊗ Ξn . It
is easy to see that Schur functions {sα,φ | (α, φ)            ∈P eq } are linearly independent in

where Ξp,q j (Xj ) denotes the space Ξp,q j with repsect to the variables Xj . (2.12.1) is
immediate from (2.10.1).
     It follows from Proposition 2.11 that pβ,b ∈ ΞnC (p; q) if wβ (b) ∈ σ q W . By making
use of the Frobenius formula, we can give a complete description of W -orbits of σ q W .
First we prepare some notations. Take w = wβ (b) ∈ σ q W . For 0 ≤ j < p, we define
fj (w) ∈ Z/pZ by
                             (
                              bj (mod p)         if β satisfies (2.6.1),
(2.12.2)            fj (w) =
                              0                  otherwise.

     By Proposition 2.7 and (2.10.2), we can associate to each W -orbit in σ q W a well-
defined function pβ,b (x), where w = wβ (b) is a representative of this orbit. We denote
pβ,b (x) also by pw (x). As a corollary to Proposition 2.11, we have the following
characterization of W -orbits in σ q W .

Proposition 2.13. (i) Assume that w, w ′ ∈ σ q W . Then w and w ′ are conjugate
    under W if and only if pw (x) = pw′ (x).
12                                          T. SHOJI

 (ii) Let w = wβ (b) and w ′ = wβ(b′ ) are elemetns in σ q W , (i.e., ∆(β) ≡ q (mod p),
      cf. 2.3). Then w and w ′ are conjugate under W if and only if fj (w) = fj (w ′ ) for
      j = 0, . . . , p − 1.
Proof. It is known that the “character table” (e  χα,φ (w)) of σ q W is a non-singular
matrix. (Here (α, φ) runs over all the elements in PeW
                                                     q
                                                       , and w runs over all the repre-
sentatives of W -orbits in σ W ). Since Schur functions form a basis of ΞnC (p, q), we see
                            q

that {pw | w ∈ σ q W/∼} is also a basis by Proposition 2.11. In particular, they are all
distinct. This proves (i). The second statement is then immediate from (2.10.2).

    2.14. In view of Proposition 2.13, we can determine the parameter set for the
set of W -orbits in σ q W . Put

               PqW = {(β, b) | β ∈ Pn,e , 0 ≤ b < e, ∆(β) ≡ q          (mod p)}.

We define an equivalence relation on PqW by (β, b) ∼ (β ′ , b′ ) if and only if β = β ′ and
                                     eW = Pen,e,p the set of equivalnece classes in P W .
pβ,b (x) = pβ′ ,b′ (x). We denote by Pq     q                                            q
       e W                                      q
Then Pq parametrizes the set of W -orbits in σ W , and so the set {pβ,b | (β, b) ∈ Pq }e W

gives rise to a basis of ΞnC (p, q).
    2.15. In this and next subsection, we give some examples of Schur functions and
powersum symmetric functions in typical cases, i.e., the case where W = G(2, 2, n)
and the case where W = G(e, e, 2).
    First we assume that W = G(2, 2, n). So W (resp. W     f ) is the Weyl group of type
                                         2
Dn (resp. type Bn ). In this case, θ = 1, and we have Γα ≃ Z/2Z if θ(α) = α, and
Γα = 1 otherwise. In later discussion, the case PeW   0
                                                        corresponds to the split Dn case,
              e 1
and the case PW corresponds to the non-split Dn case. For each (α, φ) ∈ P      e0 , Schur
                                                                                 W
                  0      1
function sα,φ = (sα,φ , sα,φ ) is defined as follows.
                                        X
(2.15.1)                 s0α,φ (x) =            sβ (x),
                                       β∈O(α)
                                     (
                                      ±sβ (X)             if θ(α) = α,
                         s1α,φ (x) =
                                      0                   otherwise.

Here if θ(α) = α, then α is written as α = (β; β) with a partition β of n/2, and sβ (X)
                                                            (0) (1)
is the Schur function with respect to the variables Xj = xj xj . (Note that β = α{1}
in the previous notation). The sign takes + (resp. −) if φ = 1 (resp. φ 6= 1).
     On the other hand, (α, φ) ∈ P e1 if and only if θ(α) 6= α, and so Γα = {1}. In this
                                    W
case, Schur function sα,φ (x) is given as follows.

(2.15.2)              s0α,φ (x) = sα(x) − sθ(α) (x),         s1α,φ (x) = 0.

    Next we consider the power sum symmetric function pβ,b = (p0β,b , p1β,b ). A con-
                   f lying in W decomposes into two W -orbits if and only if β =
jugacy class Cβ of W
(β; −) with a partition β = (β1 , β2 , · · · ) such that βi is even for each i. Let β ′ =
                                      GREEN FUNCTIONS                                      13

(β1 /2, β2 /2, . . . ) be a partition of n/2. Then we have β ′ = β[1] in the previous no-
tation. Such a class Cβ is called a degenerate class, and other classes are said to be
non-degenerate. The function pβ,b (x) (b = 0, 1) associated to (β, b) ∈ P  e0W is given as
follows.

(2.15.3)         p0β,b (x) = pβ (x),
                             (
                               0                      if Cβ is non-degenerate,
                 p1β,b (x) =
                               ±2l(β) pβ ′ (X)        if Cβ is degenerate.

Here pβ (x) is the function for W f , and pβ ′ (X) is the powersum symmetric function for
                                (0) (1)
Sn/2 with variables Xj = xj xj associated to the partition β ′ . The sign takes +
(resp. −) if b = 0 (resp. b = 1).
    On the other hand, (β, b) ∈ Pe1W if and only if ∆(β) ≡ 1 (mod 2) and b = 0. In
this case, pβ,b (x) is given as

                             p0β,b(x) = pβ (x),           p1β,b (x) = 0.




    2.16. We now consider the case where W = G(e, e, 2). So W is the dihedral
group of order 2e. Put

                    α0 = (2; −; · · · ; −),
                   αij = (−; · · · ; 1; · · · ; 1; · · · ; −) (0 ≤ i ≤ j < e),

where in the second case, 1 appears only in the i-th and j-th entries. If i = j, we
understand that αii = (−; · · · ; 11; · · · ; −). Then the set of representatives of θ-orbits
of P2,e is given as {α0 , α0j | 0 ≤ j ≤ e/2}. Here Γα = {1} unless e is even and
j = e/2, in which case Γα0j = Z/2Z. Consequently, Schur functions sα,φ = (skα,φ )0≤k<e
associated to (α, φ) ∈ PeW0
                            are given as follows.
                           P
                           
                            P β∈O(α) sβ (x)             if k = 0,
                 k
(2.16.1)        sα,φ (x) = ± β′ ∈O(α′ ) sβ′ (X)          if α = α0,e/2 and k = e/2,
                           

                             0                           otherwise.

In the second case, α′ = (1; −; · · · ; −) is an e/2-partition of 1 and coincides with
α{e/2}. sα′ (X) is the Schur function associated to α′ with respect to the variables
                               (k)  (k) (e/2+k)                  P (0) (e/2)
X (0) , . . . , X (e/2−1) for Xj = xj xj        . Hence sα′ (X) = j xj xj    and we have

                                              e/2−1
                               e/2

                                               i=0    j


The sign takes + (resp. −) if φ = 1 (resp. φ 6= 1).

    Next we consider power sum symmetric functions. A conjugacy class Cβ ⊂ W
belongs to W in the following case;

                                     {α0 ,    αi,e−i (0 ≤ i ≤ e/2)}.

     Then pβ,b = (pkβ,b (x))0≤k<e associated to (β, b) ∈ Pe0W is given as

where α′ = (1; −; · · · ; −) is the e/2-partition as given before and also coincides with
α0 [e/2], and pα′ (X) is the power sum symmetric function associated to α′ with respect
to variables {X (0) , . . . , X (e/2−1) }. Hence we have

            3. Hall-Littlewood functions associated to G(e, p, n)

     3.1. Here we review some results from [S] concerning symmetric functions as-
sociated to W    f . In what follows we regard the variables x(k) defined for k ∈ Z/eZ ≃
                                                              i
{0, 1, . . . , e − 1}. For each 0 ≤ k < e and an integer r ≥ 0, we define a function
 (k)
qr,± (x; t) (according to the sign + or −) by
                                                     Q      (k)           (k±1)

where δ = mk − 1 − mk±1 , and by qr,± (x; t) = 1 for r = 0. In the product of the
               (k)                                                  (k)
denominator, xj runs over all the variables in x(k) except xi , while in the numerator,
 (k±1)                                                      (k)
xj     runs over all the variables in x(k±1) . Then qr,± (x; t) is a polynomial in Z[x; t],
homogenoeous of degree r with respect to the variables x(k) , x(k±1) ([S, Lemma 2.3]).
    For an e-partition α = (α(0) , . . . , α(e−1) ) ∈ Pn,e , we define a function qα,± (x) by
                                                         mk

     For α = (αj ) ∈ Pn.e , we define a function zα(t) by

where in the product, we neglect the factors such that αj = 0. zα is the order
of the centralizer of wα in Q f . Explicitly, zα is given as follows. For a partition

β = (1 , 2 , . . . ), put zβ = i≥1 ini ni !. Then zα = el(α) k=0 zα(k) .
    For later use, we also give the order of the stabilzer ZW (w) of w ∈ σ q W in W .
Assume that Cα ⊂ σ q W and that Cα decomposes into r distinct W -orbits. Since these
W -orbits have the same cardinality, we have for w ∈ Cα,

The following formula was proved in [S, Proposition 2.5].

Proposition 3.2. We have
                          X                    X
(3.2.1)      Ω(x, y; t) =   qα,+ (x; t)mα(y) =   mα(x)qα,− (y; t),
                                 α                               α
                               X
                                         −1
(3.2.2)         Ω(x, y; t) =         zα(t) pα(x)p̄α(y),
                                 α

where α runs over all the e-partitions of any size. In (3.2.2), p̄α(y) denotes the complex
conjugate of pα(y).


    3.3. We define an isomorphism θ of C[x] (the polynomial ring with infinitely many
                 (k)    (k+d)                                        (k)         (k)
variables) by θ(xj ) = xj     . Then it follows from (2.2.2) that θ(pr ) = ζ −kdpr , and
so we have

(3.3.1)                               θ(pα) = ζ −∆(α)d pα.

    On the other hand, it can be checked easily from the definition that

(3.3.2)        θ(sα) = sθ(α) ,        θ(mα) = mθ(α) ,                θ(qα,± ) = qθ(α),± .

    We now introduce an operator Θq : C[x] → C[x] for a factor q of e by
                                               p−1
                                               X
(3.3.3)                                 Θq =         ζ qidθi .
                                               i=0
16                                              T. SHOJI

Then it is easy to see that
                                 (
                                     p · pβ        if ∆(β) ≡ q       (mod p),
(3.3.4)              Θq (pβ) =
                                     0             otherwise.

Take α ∈ Pn,e and put c = cα,p as before. Then it follows from (3.3.2) that we have
                            c−1
                            p X ζ qids i
                           
                                                             if qc ≡ 0 (mod p),
                                       θ (α)
(3.3.5)           Θq (sα) = c i=0
                           
                           
                             0                               otherwise.

Similar formulas as (3.3.5) hold also for Θq (mα) and Θq (qα,± ) by replacing sθi (α) in
(3.3.5) by mθi (α) and qθi (α),± .
    Let us define mjα,φ (x) and qα,φ,±
                                   j
                                       (x; t), for each 0 ≤ j < p, as in the case of sα,φ (x)
by replacing sθi (α){j} in (2.10.1) by mθi (α){j} and qθi (α){j},± . We put
                                j
(3.3.6)             q α,φ,± = (qα,φ,± )0≤j<p ,             mα,φ = (mjα,φ )0≤j<p .

                                          (k)             (k+d)
Note that θ induces an action θ(Xi ) = Xi               on the variables Xj . Thus similar
formulas as (3.3.4) and (3.3.5) hold also for funlctions pα[j] (Xj ) and sα{j} (Xj ), etc.
(More precisely, the formula for sα{j} is completely similar to (3.3.5). But for pβ(Xj ),
                                                           (k)               (k)
ζ must be replaced by ζ h . In particular, we have θ(pr (Xj )) = ζ −khdpr (Xj ). Hence
the condition in the first formula in (3.3.4) should be replaced by “if h∆(β) ≡ q
(mod p)” for a j1 d-partitionP   β). Now qα,± can be written as a linear combination of
sβ. Then by applying Θq , i ζ qid qθi (α),± can be written as a linear combination of
        P                                 j         n/h
various i ζ qidsθi (β) . It follows that qα,φ,± ∈ Ξp,q j (Xj ). Hence by (2.12.1), q α,φ,± is
contained in ΞnC(t) (p, q) = C(t) ⊗ ΞnC (p, q). Similarly, mα,φ is contained in ΞnC(t) (p, q).
Now it is easy to see that the sets {q α,φ,± | (α, φ) ∈ PeW   q
                                                                } and {mα,φ | (α, φ) ∈ Peq }
                                                                                          W
form bases of ΞnC(t) (p, q).
                                                                                    (k)
      For each j (0 ≤ j < p), we also consider the variables Yj = (Yi ) defined
                                                                 (k)
in a similar way as Xj but obtained from the variables y = (yi ) instead of x =
  (k)
(xi ). We now define Cauchy’s reproducing kernel associated to σ q W by Ωq (x, y; t) =
(Ωjq (x, y; t))0≤j<p, with

(3.3.7)                     Ωjq (x, y; t) = Θq,Xj (Ω(Xj , Yj ; thj )),

where Ω(Xj , Yj ; thj ) is the function defined in a similar way as (3.1.4), with respect to
the variables Xj , Yj and thj . Θq,Xj stands for the action of Θq on the variables Xj . For
w = wα(b) ∈ σ q W , we define zα,b (t) by
                                                mk
                                            e−1 Y
                                            Y                 (k)
(3.3.8)                     zα,b (t) = zα,b        (1 − ζ k tαj )−1 .
                                                k=0 j=1

Hence, zα,b (t) is the one obtained from zα(t) by replacing zα = |ZW
                                                                   f (w)| by zα,b =
|ZW (w)|, and so it coincides with rp−1 Zα(t) by (3.1.4).
    The following proposition gives a counter part of Propostion 3.2 to the case of
σq W .



Proposition 3.4. Ωq (x, y; t) has the following expansions.
                                            X                                   X

where (α, φ) runs over all the elements in ∞   n=1 Pn,e,p in (3.4.1). In (3.4.2), (α, b) runs
                          S      en,e,p . mα,φ (resp. q α,φ,− , pα,b ) denotes the complex
over all the elements in ∞  n=1 Pq
conjugate of mα,φ (resp. q α,φ,− , pα,b ), respectively.



Proof. First we show (3.4.1). We fix j and put h = hj as before. Let us consider the
expansion of Ω(Xj , Yj ; th ) by making use of the first equality of (3.2.1). By applying
the operator Θq,Xj on both sides of this expansion, we have
                                                       X
(3.4.3)                          Ωjq (x, y; t) =              Θq (qβ,+ (Xj ; th ))mβ (Yj ),
                                                         β


where β runs over j1 d-partitions of any size. Take β ∈ Pn/h,j1d . In view of (3.3.5), we
may only consider β such that qc ≡ 0 (mod p) in the sum (3.4.3), where c = cβ,p . By
making use of the formula for Θq (qβ,+ ) which is similar to (3.3.5), we have

                         X                                 X p X
                                                                c−1              
                                                                     qid
(3.4.4)                          Θq (qβ′ ,+ )mβ′        =           ζ qθi (β′ ),+ mβ′

                                                                  c−1            c−1

                                                        =       ζ qθi (β),+   ζ −qkdmθk (β) .
                                                          c i=0
                                                                                 k=0

Now there exists α ∈ Pn,e such that β = α{j}. Then c coinicdes with cα,p . Moreover
the action of θ on β is compatible with that on α. Then the last formula of (3.4.4)
can be written as
              X                c−1

It follows that
                                              X        j
                            Ωjq (x, y; t) =           qα,φ,+ (x; t)mjα,φ (y),
                                              (α,φ)

                                           S
where (α, φ) runs over all the elements in ∞     eq
                                             n=1 Pn,e,p . This shows the first equality of
(3.4.1). The second equality is shown similarly.
    Next we show (3.4.2). We consider the expansion of Ω(Xj , Yj ; th ) by (3.2.2). By
applying Θq,Xj on this equality, together with (3.3.4), we have
                                              X
(3.4.5)                   Ωjq (x, y; t) = p          zβ (th )−1 pβ(Xj )pβ(Yj ),
                                               β


where β runs over j1 d-partitions of any size such that h∆(β) ≡ q (mod p) (see the
discussion in 3.3). zβ(th ) is the function defined similar to (2.1.3) for a j1 d-partition
β, by replacing ζ by ζ h. We fix β ∈ Pn/h,j1 d as above. Then there exists α ∈ Pn,e such
that β = α[j]. Hence α satsifies (2.6.1), and ∆(α) = h∆(β). Let r be the number of
                       en,e,p for a fixed α. Then by (2.10.2), we have
all the pairs (α, b) ∈ Pq

                                                             X
(3.4.6)                 pβ(Xj )pβ(Yj ) = h−2l(β) r −1              pjα,b (x)pjα,b (y),
                                                               b

where the sum is taken over all the pairs (α, b) for a fixed α. Now using the explicit
description of zα(t) in (3.1.3) and subsequent parts, one can check that

(3.4.7)                              zβ (th ) = h−2l(β) zα(t).

Substituting (3.4.6) and (3.4.7) into (3.4.5), together with (3.3.8), we have
                                            X
                          Ωjq (x, y; t) =           zα,b (t)−1 pjα,b (x)pjα,b (y),

where (α, b) runs over all the elements in                 n=1 Pq         This implies (3.4.2), and the
propostion is proved.



    3.5. As in [S], we denote by Zn0,0 = Zn0,0 (m) the set of e-partitions α such that
|α| = n and that each α(k) is regarded as an element in Zmk , written in the form
        (k)          (k)
α(k) : α1 ≥ · · · ≥ αmk ≥ 0. We fix an integer r > 0, and consider an e-partition

with the symbol of the form Znr,0 = Znr,0 (m), i.e., the set of e-partitions of the form
Λ = α+Λ0 , where α ∈ Zn0,0 and the sum is taken entry-wise. We denote by Λ = Λ(α)

if Λ = α + Λ0 , and call it the e-symbol of type (r, 0) corresponding to α. We write
|Λ| = n if Λ ∈ Znr,0 .
      As in [S], we consider the shift operation Znr,0 (m) → Znr,0(m′ ) for m′ = (m0 +
1, . . . , me−1 + 1) by associating Λ′ = α + Λ0 (m′ ) to Λ = α + Λ0 (m), where α is
regarded as an element of Zn0,0 (m′ ) by adding 0 in the entries ` of α. We often consider
the symbols as elements in the equivalence class in the set m′ Znr,0 (m′ ) under the
shift operation. We denote by Z̄nr,0 the set of equivalence classes. Note that Λ0 is
regarded as a symbol in Znr,0 with n = 0.
      Two elements Λ and Λ′ in Z̄nr,0 are said to be similar (and denoted as Λ ∼ Λ′ )
if there exist representatives in Znr,0 such that all the entries of them coincide each
other with multiplicities. The equivalence class with respect to this relation is called
a similarity class in Z̄nr,0 .
      We shall define a function a : Z̄nr,0 → N. For Λ ∈ Znr,0 , we put
                                    X                       X
(3.5.2)               a(Λ) =               min(λ, λ′ ) −              min(µ, µ′),
                                 λ,λ′ ∈Λ                   µ,µ′ ∈Λ0


which induces a well-defined function a on Z̄nr,0 . The a-function takes a constant value
on each similarity class in Znr,0. By using the bijection Zn0,0 ≃ Znr,0 , a-functions and
similarity classes are defined for Zn0,0 , for which we use the same notation as for Zn0,0 .
    Under the natural bijection Pn,e ≃ Zn0,0 ≃ Znr,0 , the operation θ is transfered to the
action on Znr,0, which we denote also by θ. It is clear that θ preserves each similarity
class in Znr,0 .

    3.6. As discussed in [S], {sα(x)} and {mα(x)} form bases of the Z[t]-module
Z[t] ⊗ Ξ, and {qα,± (x; t)} form a basis of Q(t) ⊗Z Ξ = ΞQ [t]. Moreover, {pα(x)} gives
a basis of C(t)-space ΞC [t] = C(t) ⊗Z Ξ.
    Following [S], we define a scalar product on ΞQ [t] by the condition that

(3.6.1)                             hqα,+ (x; t), mβ (x)i = δα,β,

and extend it to a sesquilinear form on ΞC [t]. Then by Proposition 3.2, we also have

(3.6.2)                        hmα(x), qβ,− (x; t)i = δα,β,
                                      hpα(x), pβ (x)i = zα(t)δα,β.

    The Hall-Littlewood functions PΛ± (x; t) and Q±       Λ(x; t) were introduced in [S]. By
Corollary 4.6 in [S], they satisfy the following formulas.
                            X

|Λ| = |Λ | and Λ ∼ Λ . In (3.6.4), Λ runs over all the elements in ∞

     We now define a total order ≺ on the set Zn0,0 satisfying the condition that each
similarity class forms an interval and that a(α) > a(β) implies that α ≺ β. The
following characterization of Hall-Littlewood functions was given in Propostion 4.8 in
[S].


Proposition 3.7. (i) PΛ± are characterized by the following two properties.
    (a) PΛ± (x; t) can be expressed in terms of sβ (x) as

 (ii) The functions {Q±                                                 ±

     3.8. We now define a sesquilinear form on ΞnC(t) (p, q) by the condition that

(3.8.1)                              hq z,+ (x; t), mz ′ (x)i = δz,z ′

for z, z ′ ∈ Pen,e,p
               q
                     . Then by Proposition 3.4, we also have

(3.8.2)                hmz (x), q z ′ (x; t)i = δz,z ′    (z, z ′ ∈ Pen,e,p

(α, φ) ∈ Pn,e,p and that α ∈ Zn . We often identify Zen,q

                                                     0,0

We define a total order ≺ on Zen,q          0,0
                                                compatible with the order on Zn0,0 , i.e., for z =
(α, φ), z ′ = (α′ , φ′ ) ∈ Zen,q
                              0,0
                                  , we have z ≺ z ′ if a(α) > a(α′ ), and the set {(α, φ)}, where
α falls in a fixed similarlity class in Zn0,0 , form an interval in this order.
    The scalar product on ΞC [t] given in 3.6 induces a sesquilinear form h , ij on the
                 n/h
space C(t) ⊗ Ξp,q j (Xj ), which satisfies the formula
                                           (
              j                             φ(τ j )φ′ (τ j )cα,p         if α = α′ and cα,p | j,
(3.8.3)     hqα,φ,+  (x), mjα′ ,φ′ (x)ij =

This implies that for u = (uj ), v = (v j ) ∈ ΞnC(t) (p, q) =  j=0 C(t) ⊗ Ξp,q (Xj ), the
following formula holds, since it certainly holds for u = q α,φ,+ and v = mα′ ,φ′ by

   3.9. In view of (3.3.2) and (3.6.1), the automorphism θ leaves the scalar product
on ΞQ [t] invariant. It follows by Proposition 3.7 that we have

                            θ(PΛ± ) = Pθ(Λ)
                                       ±
                                            ,             θ(Q±     ±
                                                             Λ) = Qθ(Λ) .


Hence a similar formula as (3.3.5) holds also for PΛ± (resp. for Q± Λ), by replacing sθ i (α)
    ±                 ±                                   e 0,0
by Pθi (Λ) (resp. by Qθi (Λ) ). Now for each z = (α, φ) ∈ Zn,q , we define

(3.9.1)                P±     ±,j
                        z = (Pz )0≤j<p ,               Q±     ±.j
                                                        z = (Qz )0≤j<p ,


where Pz±,j and Q±,j  z  are defined as in the case of sα,φ (x) by replacing sθi (α){j} in
(2.10.1) by Pθi (Λ){j} and Q±
              ±
                             θ i (Λ){j} . By using a s similar argument as in 3.3, we see that
the sets {Pz } and {Qz } give rise to bases of ΞnC(t) (p, q).
            ±            ±

    It is known that PΛ± (x; 0) = sα(x) for Λ(α) = Λ by [S]. Hence by (3.9.1), we have

(3.9.2)                            P±
                                    Λ(α),φ (x; 0) = sα,φ (x).


    The functions P±           ±
                    z (x) and Qz (x) are charactersized by the following properties, in
analogy to Proposition 3.7.

Proposition 3.10. (i) P±            er,0
                            z (z ∈ Zn,q ) are characterized by the following two proper-
    ties.
    (a) P±z (x; t) can be expressed in terms of sz ′ (x) as
                                                     X

            z , Pz ′ i = 0 unless z ∼ z .
 (ii) The functions {Qz } are characterized as the dual basis of {P±
                           ±
                                                                       z }, i.e.,

                       z , Qz ′ i = hQz , Pz ′ i = δz,z ′           (z, z ′ ∈ Zen,q
                                                                                r,0
                                                                                    ).

Proof. By substituting t = 0 into (3.4.2), we have
                                        X
                                            −1
                         Ωq (x, y; 0) =    zα,b pα,b (x)pα,b(y),
                                            (α,b)


where zα,b = |ZW (w)| for w = wα(b). On the other hand, starting from the expansion
of Ω(x, y; 0) by means of Schur functions sα(x) as given in Remark 4.9 in [S], by using
22                                                  T. SHOJI

a similar argument as in the proof of (3.4.1), one can show that
                                         X
                          Ωq (x, y; 0) =     sα,φ (x)sα,φ (y).
                                                      (α,φ)


It follows that one can define a hermitian form on ΞnC (p, q) satisfying the properties
                                                                                        eq ). Hence
that hpξ , pξ′ i = δξ,ξ′ (ξ, ξ ′ ∈ Peqn,e,p ), and that hsz , sz ′ i = δz,z ′ (z, z ′ ∈ Pn,e,p
the seaquiliner form on ΞnC(t) (p, q) is reduced to the hermitian form on ΞnC (p, q) by
substituting t = 0. Now the arguments in the proof of Proposition 4.8 and Remark
4.9 in [S] can be applied to our situation, and one can show that there exist unique
functions satisfying the properties (i), (ii) in the proposition, respectively. So, we have
only to show that P±          ±
                        z , Qz satisfy the properties in the proposition.
                                +,j
     First we note that hPΛ,φ       , PΛ−,j                            ′
                                          ′ ′ i = 0 unless Λ ∼ Λ by Proposition 3.7. It follows
                                           ,φ
                                            −
from (3.8.4) that we have hP+                                       ′
                                      z , Pz ′ i = 0 unless z ∼ z . This shows the proerty (b) of
(i). Next we shall show the property (a). Clearly the statement (a) is equivalent to
the statement that
                                                       X
(3.10.1)                                  P± z  = sz +     d±      ±
                                                            z,z ′ Pz ′
                                                               z′


for any z, z ′ ∈ Zen,q
                   r,0
                       , where d±                 ′              ′
                                z,z ′ = 0 unless z ≺ z and z 6∼ z .
    We consider the equation (3.10.1) for a fixed z with respect to the + sign. Take
z such that z ′ ≺ z and z 6∼ z ′ . Taking the scalar product with P−
 ′
                                                                    z ′ on both sides of
(3.10.1), we have
                                               X
(3.10.2)                      hsz , P−
                                     z ′ i+               d+        +       −
                                                           z,z ′′ hPz ′′ , Pz ′ i = 0.
                                              z ′′ ∼z ′


When z ′ runs over all the elements in a fixed similarity class, (3.10.2) can be regarded
as a system of equations with unknown variables {d+    z,z ′′ }. As in the arguments in the
first part of the proof (cf. Remark 4.9 in [S]), the matrix (hP+            −
                                                                    z ′′ , Pz ′ i) is non-singular.
Hence (3.10.2) has a unique solution {d+ z,z ′′ }. Put

                                                           X
                                      Fz = sz +                      d+       +
                                                                      z,z ′′ Pz ′′
                                                             z ′′


using thus determined d+           ′′             ′′
                       z,z ′′ for z ≺ z and z 6∼ z . Then clearly we have


(3.10.3)              hP+    −              −
                        z , Pz ′ i = hFz , Pz ′ i                   for z ′ ≺ z and z ′ 6∼ z.

On the other hand, it follows from Proposition 3.7 that we have
                 +
               hPΛ(α) , PΛ−′ i = hsα, PΛ−′ i               for Λ(α) ≺ Λ′ or Λ(α) ∼ Λ′ .

This implies, in view of (3.8.4), that

(3.10.4)               hP+    −              −              −
                         z , Pz ′ i = hsz , Pz ′ i = hFz , Pz ′ i         for z ≺ z ′ or z ∼ z ′ .

Now (3.10.3) and (3.10.4) implies that P+     z = Fz ,              and (3.10.1) is proved for P+
                                                                                                z . The
           −
proof for Pz is similar.
   Finally, we show (ii). By Proposition 3.7 (ii),                  we have
                             (
                +,j   −,j     φ(τ j )φ′ (τ j )cα,p                   if cα,p | j and z = z ′ ,
             hPz , Qz ′ ij =
                              0                                      otherwise.

                                      −                                   −
This implies, by (3.8.4), that hP+                                   +
                                 z , Qz ′ i = δz,z ′ . The formula hQz , Pz ′ i = δz,z ′ is shown
similarly.
    As a corollary to Proposition 3.10, we have
Corollary 3.11. Ωq (x, y; t) has the following expansions.

                                                           z (x; t)P̄z ′ (y; t)
                                        z,z ′
                                        X                                 X
(3.11.2)              Ωq (x, y; t) =            Q+         −
                                                 z (x; t)P̄z (y; t) =             P+         −
                                                                                   z (x; t)Q̄z (y; t),
                                         z                                  z

                                                               S
where z = (Λ, φ), z ′ = (Λ′ , φ′ ) run over all the elements in ∞    er,0
                                                                 n=1 Zn,q , and bz,z ′ = 0
unless |Λ| = |Λ′ | and Λ ∼ Λ′ in (3.9.1). In (3.9.2), z = (Λ, φ) runs over all the
            S
elements in ∞     er,0
              n=1 Zn,q .

Proof. (3.11.2) follows from (3.4.1) and Proposition 3.10   P(ii) by a−standard argument, +
(e.g. [M, I, 4.6]). We show (3.11.1). We write P−      z  =                                       −
                                                               z ′ az,z ′ Qz ′ . Since hPz ′ , Pz i =
az,z ′ , Proposition 3.10 (b) implies that the transition matrix between two bases {P−               z}
and {Q−    z } is a block diagonal matrix with respect to the partition    by    similarity
                                                                                      P      classes.
                                                                                                     −
Hence its inverse matrix is also block diagonal, i.e., Q− z is written as Qz =
                                                                                  −
                                                                                         z ′ bz,z ′ Pz ′ ,
where bz,z ′ = 0 unless z ∼ z ′ . Substituting this into the second formula in (3.11.2), we
obtain (3.11.1). Thus the corollary is proved.



                     4. Green functions associated to G(e, p, n)

    4.1. For functions f, h on σ q W , we define an inner product hf, hiq by
                                                           X
                                 hf, hiq = |W |−1                 f (w)h(w).
                                                         w∈σq W

It is known in general that the number of σ q -stable irreducible characters is equal
to the number of W -orbits in σ q W . An σ q -stable irreducible character χ on W can
be extended to an irreducible character of hσ q i⋉W , in e/q distinct way. We fix an

extension χ
          e of χ. Then χ  e gives a function on σ q W by restriction, which is constant
on each W -orbit. It is known that
                                         (
                                          1     if χ
                                                   e=χ  e′ ,
(4.1.1)                      he  e′ iq =
                              χ, χ
                                          0     if χ 6= χ′ .

Now the set of σ q -stable irreducible characters is parametrized by P eq . Also the set
                                                                        W
of W -orbits in σ q W is parametrized by PeqW . We fix a total order on PeW
                                                                          q
                                                                            ≃ Zen,q

                                                                                    as in
3.6. Let X = (e   z          e q      e W                             q
                χ (ξ)) (z ∈ PW , ξ ∈ Pq ) be the character table of σ W . We define H
as the diagonal matrix indexed by P  eq whose diagonal entry corresponding to (ξ, ξ)
                                       n,e,p
is zξ−1 = |ZW (wα(b)|−1 for ξ = (α, b). Then (4.1.1) can be written in a matrix form
                                            t
(4.1.2)                                         XH X̄ = I.



    4.2. Let M = Cn be the natural reflection representation of W f . We consider M
as a W -module by the restrition. Let S(M) be the symmetric algebra of M, and I+ the
ideal of S(M) generated by W -invariant homogeneous vectors of strictly positiv degree.
We deonte by R = S(M)/I+ the coinvariant algebra of W . The Poincaré   Lpolynomial
PW (t) associated to W is defined in terms of the graded algebra R =       Ri . In our
case, PW (t) is explicitly given as
                                                n−1
                                                Y ei  t − 1 tdn − 1
                                 PW (t) =                  ·        .
                                                i=1
                                                       t−1   t−1

Since σ normalizes W , σ acts naturally on R, stablizing each summand Ri . We denote
   ei the thus obtained W
by R                     f -module.
                                        f defined by the determinant on M. For each
    Let detM be the linear character of W
f -stable function f on σ W , we deifne Rq (f ) ∈ C(t) by
W                         q


                                           n−1

where N ∗ is the number of reflections in W . Also we define a matrix Ω′q = (ωz,z
                                                                              ′

In either of the formulas, detM etc. denote the complex conjugates of them. Let
P = (pz,z ′ ) and Λ = (λz,z ′ ) be the matrices indexed by Zen,q
                                                             0,0
                                                                 . We consider the following
system of equations with unknown variables pz,z ′ , λz,z ′ ;

                  λz,z ′ = 0     unless z ∼ z ′ ,
(4.3.2)           pz,z ′ = 0     unless either z ≻ z ′ and z 6∼ z ′ , or z = z ′ ,
                  pz,z ′ = ta(z) ,
                  P Λ tP = Ωq .

As discussed in [S, 1.5], the system of equations (4.1.2) is equivalent to the system of
equations

(4.3.3)                                    P ′ Λ′ tP ′′ = Ω′q ,

where either of P ′ = (p′z,z ′ ) and P ′′ = (pz,z ′ ) satisfies similar conditions as in the second
and third one in (4.3.2), and Λ′ = (λz,z ′ ) as in the first one. (Actually, it is shown that
P = P ′). In the reamider of this section, we shall show that the solution of (4.1.3) can
be descrbed in a combinatorial way.


 Remark 4.4. In the case where e = p = 2, G(e, e, n) is the Weyl group of type
Dn . In this case, the equation (4.2.2) coincides with (4.2.3), and the solution for it
describes the Green functions of SO2n defined over a finite field of odd characteristic
of split type (resp. non-split type) if q = 0 (resp. q = 1).


   4.5.    For two bases X, Y of ΞnC(t) (p, q), we denote by M(X, Y ) the transition
matrix between X and Y . Let X± (t) be the transition matrix M(p, P± ) between the
power sum symmetric functions {pξ } and the Hall-Littlewood functions {P± z }, i.e.,

                                                X
                                                         z
(4.5.1)                              pξ (x) =           Xξ,± (t)P±
                                                                 z (x; t).
                                                    z

        eqn,e,p is the row-index and z = (Λ, φ) ∈ Pen,e,p
(Here ξ P                                            q
                                                          is the column-index.) Then by
                                                                      z
(3.8.1) and by the properties of PΛ shown in [S], we see that Xξ;±       (t) ∈ C(t) and is
equal to zero unless |z| = |ξ|. (For z = (α, φ) and ξ = (β, b), we put |z| = |α| and
|ξ| = |β|, respectively.) Moreover since P±z (x; 0) = sz (x) by (3.9.2), we have

                                         z
(4.5.2)                                 Xξ;±       eα,φ (wβ(b))
                                             (0) = χ

by Proposition 2.11. It follows that X± (0) = M(p, s) is the character table of W . In
particular, X± (0) is independent of the sign, which we denote simply as X(0). By

combining (3.4.2) and (3.11.1), we have
                X                           X
                    zξ (t)−1 pξ (x)pξ (y) =   bz,z ′ (t)P+         −
                                                         z (x; t)P̄z ′ (y; t),
                  |ξ|=n                                z,z ′


where in the right hand side, z, z ′ run over all elements in Zen,qr,0
                                                                       . We put D(t) =
                                         e q      e 0,0
D− = (bz,z ′ (t)), the matrix indexed by Pn,e,p ≃ Zn,q , and denote by Z(t) the diagonal
matrix indexed by Peqn,e,p , where the entry corresponding to (ξ, ξ) is given by zξ (t).
Substituting (4.5.1) into the above equation, we have
                                   t
                                       X+ (t)Z(t)−1 X̄− (t) = D(t).

If we put Λ(t) = D(t)−1 , the above formula is equivalent to

(4.5.3)                                X̄− (t)Λ(t) tX+ (t) = Z(t).


   4.6. Let K± (t) = M(s, P± ) be the transition matrix between Schur functions
and Hall-Littlewood functions, i.e., for z, z ′ ∈ Pen,e,p
                                                    q
                                                          ,
                                               X
(4.6.1)                           sz ′ (x) =          Kz±′ ,z (t)P±
                                                                  z (x; t).
                                                 z

Then by Proposition 3.10, K± (t) is a block lower triagnlar matrix with identity di-
agonal blocks, with entries in C(t). Since M(s, P± ) = M(p, s)−1 M(p, P± ), we have
K± (t) = X(0)−1 X± (t). Substituting this into (4.5.3), we have

(4.6.2)                    K− (t)Λ(t) tK+ (t) = X̄(0)−1 Z(t) tX(0)−1.

     We now define Green functions Qzξ;± (t) ∈ C(t) by

                                       Qzξ;± (t) = ta(z) Xξ;±
                                                          z
                                                              (t−1 ).

          e ±′ (t) = ta(z) K ±′ (t−1 ), Qz (t) can be written as
If we put K z ,z            z ,z         ξ;±

                                               X
                                Qzξ;± (t) =
                                                        ′′
                                                                e ±′′ (t)
                                                      ez (wβ(b))K
                                                      χ           z ,z
                                               z ′′


for ξ = (β, b). Let Ke ± (t) = (K
                                e ±′ (t)). Then K e ± (t) = K± (t−1 )T , where T is a a
                                  z ,z
diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ta(z) . Hence (4.6.2) can be rewritten as

(4.6.3)                   e − (t)Λ′ (t) tK
                          K              e + (t) = X̄(0)−1 Z(t−1 ) tX(0)−1 ,

                                                                                 e ± (t) are
where Λ′ (t) = T −1 Λ(t−1 )T . Here Λ′ (t) is still a block diagonal matrix, and K
block lower triangular matrices, where the diagonal blocks consist of scalar matrices
ta(z) I.

The following result gives a combinatorial description of the solution of (4.3.3).


Theorem 4.7. We have
                                  e − (t)Λ(t)
                                  K      e tK e + (t) = Ω′ .

            e − (t), P ′′ = K
Hence P ′ = K               e + (t) and Λ′ = Λ(t)
                                             e give a solution for the equation (4.3.3).

Proof. Let Y be the right hand side of (4.6.2). We shall compute Y . Let wα(b) be
the element in σ q W corresponding to ξ = (α, b). Since X(0) is the character table
of σ q W , we have tX(0)H X̄(0) = I by (4.1.2), where H is the diagonal matrix with
diagonal entries zξ−1 . It follows that

(4.7.1)                         Y = tX(0)HZ(t−1)H X̄(0).

                                  (k)
Now it is known that if α = (αj ) ∈ Pn,e , we have

                                                               (k)
                                               e−1 l(α
                                               Y     Y ) (k)
                       detM (t · idM −wα(b)) =          (tαj − ζ k ).
                                                        k=0 j=1


Hence by (3.3.8), zα,b (t−1 ) = zα,b tn detV (t · idV −wα(b))−1 . In particular, the (z, z ′ )-
entry of Y is equal to

                                          X           ez (w)e
                                                      χ       χz ′ (w)
                             tn |W |−1                                 .
                                         w∈σq W
                                                    detM (t · idM −w)

Therefore Ω′q = t−n G(t)Y and the theorem follows.

On the other hand, by using (4.6.1), we can express sz in terms of a linear combination

This proves the proposition.
The following special case would be worth mentioning.
Corollary 4.10. Assume that Γα = Γα′ = {1}. Then we have

    As in the case of Green functions associated to G(e, 1, n), one can expect that,

for z, z ′ ∈ Zn,q
               r,0
                   , Kz,z ′ (t) is a polynomial in t with positive integral coefficeints. In
                                                                 ±
view of Corollary 4.10, the conjecture for G(e, 1, n), i.e., Kα,α′ (t) ∈ Z[t], implies that
  ±
Kz,z ′ (t) ∈ K[t] with K = Q(ζ).


Remarks 4.11. (i) Proposition 4.9 asserts that Green functions associated to
G(e, p, n) are completely described in terms of Green functions associated to G(e′ , 1, n′ )
with various e′ | e, n′ | n. In the classical situation, this means that Green functions
of type Dn can be described in terms of Green functions assocaited to Weyl groups
of type Bn , and Sn/2 for even n. However, note that this does not mean such Green
functions are described in terms of Green functions of Sp2n or SO2n+1 . In fact, the
Green functions of Sp2n or SO2n+1 are defined in terms of symbols of the type Znr,s (m)
with m = (m + 1, m), while our Green functions are related to the symbols of the type
Znr,0 (m) with m = (m, m), and the structure of similarity classes is different.
      (ii) The group G(e, e, 2) coinicdes with the dihedral group of degree 2e. In particu-
lar, it coincides with the Weyl group of type A2 , B2 or G2 for e = 3, 4 or 6, respectively.
The case where e = 3, our Green function coincides with the Green function asociated
to GL3 (Fq ). However, as Lemma 5.4 in the next section shows, the Green function
associated to G(e, e, 2) for e = 4 or e = 6 (for any r) does not coincide with the Green
function of type B2 or G2 .


                                            5. Examples

    5.1. In this section, we give some examples of the matrices P = K        e − (t) asso-
ciated to the group G(e, e, n). But before doing it, we shall give a general remakr
in connection with fake degrees. Assume that W = G(e, p, n), and we consider the
case where q = 0. We write P = (pz,z ′ ) for z, z ′ ∈ PeW
                                                        0
                                                          . For j = 0, . . . , e − 1, put

β j = (β (0) , . . . , β (e−1) ), where β (j) = (1n ) and β i = ∅ for i 6= j. In this case, Γβj = {1},
and we identify z = (β j , 1) with β j . Then among PeW             0
                                                                       , F = {Λ(β 0 ), . . . , Λ(β d−1 )}
gives rise to a similarity class in Zen,0 , which has the maximum a-value.
                                              r,0

    For each z ∈ P         e0 , R0 (χz ) coincides with the fake degree P hχz , Ri iti (cf. 4.2).
                            W                                                   i≥0
The following formula shows that the fake degeree can be read from the matrix P ,
which is an analogue of Lemma 7.2 in [S]. The proof is completely similar to it.
Lemma 5.2. Let W = G(e, p, n) and assume that q = 0. Put b = a(β 0 ). Then we
have
                                          d−1
                                          X
                                                t−b R(χβj )pz,βj = R(χz ),
                                          j=0


where R(χβj ) = tn(n−1)/2+jn .
    In particular, in the case where W = G(e, e, n), we have F = {Λ(β 0 )}, and
pz,β0 = tn(n−1)/2−b R(χz ).

    5.3.   Assume that W = G(e, e, 2), the dihedral group of order 2e. We shall
determine the matrix P in the case where q = 0. Let α0 , αij be e-partitions defined
in 2.16. The set PeW
                   0
                     is given as follows.

                    α0,0 ,         α0,j    (1 ≤ j < e/2),        α0,e/2 ,   α′0,e/2 ,    α0 ,

where in the case of Γα = {1}, we write as α to denote the element (α, 1) ∈ P                 e0 .
                                                                                               W
Moreover, we have Γα = Z/2Z for α = α0,e/2 (the case where e is even), and in
this case, we write as α0,e/2 , α′0,e/2 instead of (α0,e/2 , 1), (α0.e/2 , −1), respectively. The
similarity classes in Zer,0 are given as follows.
                             n,0


              F1 = {Λ(α0,0 )},             F2 = {Λ(α0,j ) | 1 ≤ j ≤ e/2},               F3 = {Λ(α0 )},

where in F2 , Λ(α0,j ) for j = e/2 is understood as Λ(α0,e/2 ), Λ(α′0,e/2 ). The a-values
on similarity classes are given as follows.

                                   a(F1 ) = e,       a(F2 ) = 1,     a(F3 ) = 0.

Note that the similarity classes and a-values of them are independent from the choice
of r.
     Next we describe irreducible characters χz associated to z ∈ P  e0 . If z = α0,0 , α0 ,
                                                                      W
  z
χ coincide with the sign character ε and the identity character 1 of W , respectively.
If e is even, α0,e/2 and α′0,e/2 correspond two linear characters (long sign character η
and short sigh character η ′ ) of W . z = α0,1 corresponds to the reflection character
ρ1 of W (hence deg ρ1 = 2). Other characters corresponding to α0,j have all degree
2. We remark that the above partition of W ∧ into similarity classes together with
a-values coincide with the partition of W ∧ into families and their a-values introduced
by Lusztig [L1] in connection with the classification of unipotent characters of finite
reductiove groups, where 1, ε, ρ1 are the special characters corresponding to families.

    The fake degrees R(χz ) of W are given as follows.

(5.3.1)                      R(1) = 1,         R(ρj ) = tj + te−j (1 ≤ j < e/2)
                             R(η) = te/2 ,        R(η ′ ) = te/2 ,
                             R(ε) = te .

    We now define an order on the set W ∧ by

                             ε, ρ1 , ρ2 , . . . , ρm , 1             if e = 2m + 1,
                             ε, ρ1 , ρ2 , . . . , ρm−1 , η, η ′, 1   if e = 2m,

and define the order on PeW
                          0
                             accordingly. We consider the matrix equation P Λ t P = Ω
indexed by Pe . Following the partition of Pe0 into similarity classes, we regard P, Λ, Ω
             0
             W                               W
as block matrices. By our assumption, P and Λ have the following shape.
                        e                                        

where k is equal to e/2 − 1 (resp. e/2 + 1) if e is odd (resp. even), Λ22 is a matrix of
degree k. P21 , P32 are matrices of the shape (k, 1), (1, k), respectively.
    Since the matrix equation P Λ tP = Ω is completely the same as the matrix equa-
tion arising from the partition into families studied by Geck and Malle [GM], where
the case of dihedral groups is explcitly computed, the matrix P in our case is described
as follows. Note that in view of Lemma 5.2, the first column of P coincides with the
fake degrees of W .

Lemma 5.4 ([GM]). Let W = G(e, e, 2) be the dihedral group of degree 2e. Assume
that q = 0. Then the matrix P associated to Zen,0
                                              r,0
                                                  is given as follows.

and p31 = 1, P32 = (1, 0, . . . , 0).
   Moreover, a part of the matrix Λ is given as follows.

              λ11 = 1,      (Λ22 )1 = t−1 (te − 1) · t P21 ,         λ33 = te−2 (t2 − 1)(te − 1),

where (Λ22 )1 denotes the first row of the matrix Λ22 .



    5.5. In the remainder of this section, we shall give some more examples of Green
functions assciated to G(e, e, n). Throughout those examples, we always assume that
r = 2 and q = 0.

Note taht |Γα4 | = 3, and we write α4 , α′4 , α′′4 instead of (α, φ) with φ ∈ Γα4 . Γα = {1}
for other α. Then the symbols and similarity classes in Zen,0   2,0
