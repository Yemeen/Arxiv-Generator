                                                   MARK GORESKY, ROBERT KOTTWITZ, AND ROBERT MACPHERSON



                                               Let k be an algebraically closed field, G a connected reductive group over k, and
                                            A a maximal torus in G. We write g for the Lie algebra of G and a for X∗ (A) ⊗Z R.
                                               Let F = k((ǫ)) be the field of formal Laurent series over k and let o = k[[ǫ]] be
                                            the subring of formal power series. We fix an algebraic closure F̄ of F . We write
                                            G and g for G(F ) and g(F ) := g ⊗k F respectively. Let y ∈ a and write Gy and
                                            gy for the associated (connected) parahoric subgroup and subalgebra respectively.
                                            For example, if y = 0, then Gy = G(o) and gy = g(o), while if y lies in the interior
                                            of an alcove, then Gy (resp., gy ) is an Iwahori subgroup (resp. subalgebra).
                                               We write Fy for the k-ind-scheme G/Gy . When y = 0 for example, Fy is the
                                            affine Grassmannian G(F )/G(o). Any u ∈ g determines a closed subset
                                                                 Fy (u) := {g ∈ G/Gy : Ad(g −1 )(u) ∈ gy }
                                            of Fy , called an affine Springer fiber. Affine Springer fibers were first studied by
                                            Kazhdan and Lusztig [KL88], who established some of their basic properties, one
                                            of which we will now recall.
                                               Let T be a maximal F -torus in G, let t be its Lie algebra (over F ), and let
                                            AT denote the maximal F -split torus in T . A regular element u ∈ t is said to be
                                            integral if val λ(u) ≥ 0 for every λ ∈ X ∗ (T ) (convention: val 0 = +∞). Here we
                                            have denoted the value of the differential of λ on u simply by λ(u), an especially
                                            abusive notation when k has characteristic p, since in that case the differential of
                                            λ is 0 whenever λ is divisible by p in X ∗ (T ). The centralizer T (F ) of u acts on
                                            Fy (u), and inside the centralizer we have the lattice Λ := X∗ (AT ), viewed as a
                                            subgroup of T (F ) by sending µ ∈ Λ to ǫµ ∈ T (F ). The lattice Λ acts freely on
                                            Fy (u), and Kazhdan and Lusztig showed that the quotient Λ\Fy (u) is a projective
                                            (usually singular) variety over k, non-empty if and only if u is integral, and they
                                            conjectured a formula for its dimension, later proved by Bezrukavnikov [Bez96].
                                               In order to state the main result of this paper, we need two more definitions.
                                            We normalize the valuation on F̄ so that val ǫ = 1. We say that regular u ∈ t is
                                            equivalued with valuation s ∈ Q if val α(u) = s for every root α of T over F̄ and
                                            val λ(u) ≥ s for every λ ∈ X ∗ (T ). (For adjoint groups G the second part of the
                                            condition is of course redundant.) When s plays no role, we say simply that u is
                                            equivalued.
                                               Hessenberg varieties were introduced by De Mari, Procesi and Shayman [MPS92].
                                            In § 1 below we define them in greater generality but still call them Hessenberg
                                            varieties. The ones in [MPS92] are non-empty and admit pavings by affine spaces,
                                            but this is not always true of the more general ones considered below (see 1.6 for
                                            the emptiness question). In any case Hessenberg varieties are certain very special
                                            non-singular closed subvarieties of (partial) flag manifolds. By a Hessenberg paving

of an ind-scheme X we mean a exhaustive increasing filtration X0 ⊂ X1 ⊂ X2 ⊂ . . .
of X by closed subschemes Xi such that each successive difference Xi \ Xi−1 is a
disjoint union of iterated affine space bundles over Hessenberg varieties.
Theorem 0.1. Assume that the order of the absolute Weyl group W of G is in-
vertible in k. Let u be a regular integral equivalued element of t. Then the affine
Springer fiber Fy (u) admits a Hessenberg paving.
   For some tori T all the (nonempty) Hessenberg varieties turn out to be single
points, in which case the Hessenberg paving becomes a paving by affine spaces.
Before stating this as a precise theorem, we need to recall that (assuming |W | is
invertible in k) the G(F )-conjugacy classes of maximal F -tori in G are parametrized
by conjugacy classes in W . (This well-known fact is reviewed in 4.2.) We say that
T is Coxeter if the associated conjugacy class in W consists of Coxeter elements.
Now consider the centralizer M of AT in G. Then M is a Levi subgroup of G
(hence is split over F ) and contains T as an elliptic maximal F -torus. We say that
T is weakly Coxeter in G if T is Coxeter in M . For example split maximal tori are
weakly Coxeter, and all maximal tori in GL(n) are weakly Coxeter.
   Our Hessenberg pavings are obtained by intersecting the affine Springer fiber
with the orbits of a parahoric subgroup that depends on T . In 3.8 we give a formula
for the dimensions of these intersections. When the parahoric subgroup turns out
to be an Iwahori subgroup, for example when T is weakly Coxeter, we get a paving
by affine spaces, reminiscent of the one found by De Concini, Lusztig and Procesi
[CLP88] for ordinary (that is, non-affine) Springer fibers, and coinciding with the
one found by Lusztig and Smelt [LS91] in the case of homogeneous u ∈ t, with T a
Coxeter torus in GL(n). More precisely, we have the following theorem, in which
the dimensions of the affine spaces mentioned in its statement can be determined
using 3.8.
Theorem 0.2. Assume that |W | is invertible in k and that T is weakly Coxeter.
Let u be a regular integral equivalued element of t. Then the affine Springer fiber
Fy (u) admits a paving by affine spaces.
   It is worth noting that the equivalued hypothesis used here is weaker than the
customary one of homogeneity. However, the homogeneity hypothesis has the virtue
of guaranteeing the existence of a useful Gm -action on the affine Springer fiber,
stemming from the automorphisms ǫ 7→ zǫ of F (z ∈ Gm ). The work of Lusztig
and Smelt has been generalized to homogeneous elements in t for Coxeter tori T
by Fan [Fan96], Sage [Sag00] and Sommers [Som97]. Quite recently these results
have been reconsidered in the context of Cherednik’s double-affine Hecke algebras
by Vasserot [Vas] and by Berest, Etingof and Ginzburg [BEG]. A homogeneous
(weakly Coxeter) case for GL(n) was analyzed by Laumon and Waldspurger [LW].
   It is also worth noting that Hessenberg pavings which are not pavings by affines
are plentiful for groups other than GL(n). Indeed this occurs in the example of
Bernstein and Kazhdan, discussed in the appendix to [KL88], in which one of the
irreducible components of the affine Springer fiber for a certain kind of homogeneous
element in sp(6) admits a dominant map to an elliptic curve.
   In the body of the paper we actually allow a more general set-up, with the role
of u ∈ g being played by vectors v ∈ V := V ⊗k F , where V is a finite dimensional
representation of G over k, and with the role of gy being played by lattices Vy,t in V
(t ∈ R) analogous to the Moy-Prasad [MP94] lattices gy,t in g. In this situation

there are (generalized) affine Springer fibers Fy (t, v) (see 3.1), having Hessenberg
pavings under suitable hypotheses on t and v (see 3.2).
    Thus, even in the traditional case V = g, in the body of the paper the parahoric
subalgebra gy occurring in the definition of Fy (u) is replaced by a Moy-Prasad lat-
tice gy,t , and we construct a Hessenberg paving of the (generalized) affine Springer
fiber Fy (t, u) for any equivalued u ∈ t with valuation s ≥ t, again under the as-
sumption that |W | is invertible in k. The special case t = 0 yields the theorem
stated earlier.
    The main theorem of this paper yields purity results used to study orbital in-
tegrals in [GKM] and in a recent preprint of Laumon [Lau]. Indeed, suppose that
G is defined and split over a subfield k0 of k, and that T and u are defined over
k0 ((ǫ)). Then our Hessenberg pavings are defined over some finite extension of k0
in k. Moreover it is clear that when an ind-scheme S over a finite field Fq admits
a Hessenberg paving defined over Fq , then all eigenvalues of the geometric Frobe-
nius on the Borel-Moore homology HiBM (X, Ql ) (with l prime to q) have complex
absolute value q i/2 .

                             1. Hessenberg varieties
  Throughout this section we consider finite dimensional representations V of G.
For λ ∈ X ∗ (A) we let Vλ denote the weight space {v ∈ V : av = λ(a)v for all a ∈ A}.

1.1. Filtrations on representations V of G. Let y ∈ a. As usual y gives rise to
an R-grading on V :               M
                              V =     V (y, t),
                                        t∈R
where V (y, t) is the direct sum of the weight spaces Vλ for weights λ ∈ X ∗ (A) such
that λ(y) = t. We will also need the associated filtrations Fyt on V , where the
subspace Fyt V is by definition ⊕t′ ≥t V (y, t′ ). Clearly Fyt V ⊂ Fys V if s ≤ t.

1.2. Unstable vectors. As usual in geometric invariant theory we say that a
vector v ∈ V is G-unstable if there exist g ∈ G, y ∈ a and t > 0 such that
v ∈ g · Fyt V .

1.3. Good vectors. We say that a vector v ∈ V is G-good if there is no non-
zero G-unstable vector v ∗ ∈ V ∗ that vanishes identically on the subspace g · v of V .
(Here V ∗ denotes the vector space dual to V .) For example, any regular semisimple
element in g is G-good, at least if the characteristic of k is different from 2 (see
5.5).

1.4. Partial flag manifold Py . Let y ∈ a. As usual y determines a parabolic
subgroup Py of G whose Lie algebra is Fy0 g. We write Py for the homogeneous
space G/Py . The subspaces Fyt V are Py -stable, so there is a G-equivariant vector
bundle Eyt V over Py whose fiber at gPy ∈ Py is equal to the subspace gFyt V of V .

1.5. Hessenberg varieties. The vector bundle Eyt V is a subbundle of the constant
vector bundle Ṽ over Py with fiber V , so we may consider the quotient vector bundle
Ṽ /Eyt V on Py . Any vector v ∈ V determines a global section of Ṽ /Eyt V , and we
define Py (t, v) to be the zero-set of this global section, a closed subscheme of Py .
Thus Py (t, v) = {g ∈ G/Py : g −1 v ∈ Fyt V }.
4          MARK GORESKY, ROBERT KOTTWITZ, AND ROBERT MACPHERSON


   The map Y 7→ Y · v from g to V can be viewed as a constant map ·v : g̃ → Ṽ
of constant vector bundles. Over Py (t, v) the vector v lies in Eyt V , so the map ·v
carries Ey0 g into Eyt V , yielding an induced map
                                  ·v : g̃/Ey0 g → Ṽ /Eyt V.
The tangent bundle to Py is g̃/Ey0 g, and it is easy to see that the Zariski tangent
space to Py (t, v) at a point of Py (t, v) is equal to the kernel of ·v : g̃/Ey0 g → Ṽ /Eyt V
on the fibers at that point.
   Now suppose that v is a G-good vector and that t ≤ 0, in which case we refer
to Py (t, v) as a Hessenberg variety. We claim that any Hessenberg variety is non-
singular and projective. Projectivity is clear. To prove non-singularity we will
check that the global section v of Ṽ /Eyt V is transverse to the zero-section, or in
other words that the map ·v : g̃/Ey0 g → Ṽ /Eyt V is surjective on fibers at each point
gPy ∈ Py (t, v). To prove surjectivity at this point we must show that any v ∗ ∈ V ∗
that annihilates both g · v and g · Fyt V is zero. Since v ∗ annihilates the second
subspace and t ≤ 0, there exists δ > 0 such that v ∗ ∈ g · Fyδ V ∗ , and therefore v ∗ is
G-unstable. Since v is G-good, it follows that v ∗ = 0.

1.6. When are Hessenberg varieties empty? Hessenberg varieties are some-
times empty. Fortunately there is a fairly practical way to determine when this
happens, as we will now see. With notation as above, choose a Borel subgroup B
of G containing A and contained in Py . The closed subvariety
                             Y := {g ∈ G/B : g −1 v ∈ Fyt V }
of the flag manifold G/B obviously maps onto the Hessenberg variety Py (t, v), and
therefore it is enough to determine when Y is empty.
   Now Y is empty precisely when its fundamental class in H • (G/B, Ql ) is 0 (where
l is a prime that is non-zero in our ground field k). Recall that the Ql -algebra
H • (G/B, Ql ) is the quotient of the symmetric algebra S • on X ∗ (A) ⊗Z Ql by the
ideal I generated by the Weyl group invariant elements that are homogeneous of
strictly positive degree.
   It follows from the discussion in 1.5 that Y is obtained as the zero-set of a global
section of the G-equivariant vector bundle on G/B obtained from the representation
V /Fyt V of B, and that moreover this global section is transverse to the zero-section.
Therefore the fundamental class of Y in H • (G/B, Ql ) is equal to the top Chern
class of our vector bundle on G/B. Filtering V /Fyt V by a complete flag of B-stable
subspaces, we see that our top Chern class is the image under S • ։ H • (G/B, Ql )
of the element λ1 . . . λm , where m is the dimension of V /Fyt V and λ1 , . . . , λm are
the characters of A (with multiplicities) occurring in the B-module V /Fyt V .
   We conclude that our Hessenberg variety is empty if and only if λ1 . . . λm lies in
the ideal I.

1.7. Some vector bundles over Hessenberg varieties in the graded case.
The following constructions will be used to produce the Hessenberg pavings of
section 3.
   Let x ∈ a. We use x to define an R/Z-grading
                                    M
                              V =      V (x, s + Z)
                                       s∈R/Z
                  PURITY OF EQUIVALUED AFFINE SPRINGER FIBERS                                5


on V , where                                  M
                           V (x, s + Z) :=          V (x, s − m),
                                              m∈Z
with V (x, s − m) as in 1.1. In this way g itself becomes an R/Z-graded Lie algebra
and V becomes an R/Z-graded g-module.
   We denote by H the subgroup of G generated by A and the root subgroups for
all roots α of A in g such that α(x) ∈ Z. Then H is a connected reductive group
whose Lie algebra is g(x, 0 + Z). The action of H on V preserves the R/Z-grading
of V .
   Now let y ∈ a and t ∈ R. Since A is also a maximal torus in H, we may apply
the construction in 1.1 to the representation V (x, s) of H, where we have written
s as an abbreviation for s + Z. In this way we get a vector subbundle Eyt V (x, s) of
the constant vector bundle Ṽ (x, s) on Py = H/Py .
   Let us fix x, y ∈ a, s, t ∈ R and v ∈ V (x, s). We assume further that t ≤ 0
and that the image of v in V is a G-good vector (which implies that v is H-good
in V (x, s)). Under these hypotheses we are going to define some vector bundles
over the Hessenberg variety Py (t, v) ⊂ Py = H/Py associated to the vector v in the
representation V (x, s) of H.
   The vector bundles depend on two additional real numbers r and t′ . We write r
for r + Z, and we put t′′ := t + t′ . We assume that t′′ ≤ 0. The action of g on V
induces a linear map
(1.7.1)                    g(x, r) ⊗ V (x, s) → V (x, r + s).
This gives rise to a constant homomorphism
                            g̃(x, r) ⊗ Ṽ (x, s) → Ṽ (x, r + s)
                                                ′                             ′′
of constant vector bundles which carries Eyt g(x, r) ⊗ Eyt V (x, s) into Eyt V (x, r + s).
Over the Hessenberg variety Py (t, v) the global section v lies in the subbundle
Eyt V (x, s). Therefore the map Y 7→ Y · v induces a homomorphism
                               ′                             ′′
(1.7.2)         ·v : g̃(x, r)/Eyt g(x, r) → Ṽ (x, r + s)/Eyt V (x, r + s),
and in fact this homomorphism is surjective at every point of the Hessenberg variety,
as one sees using the G-goodness of v and the fact that t′′ ≤ 0, just as in the
proof of non-singularity of Hessenberg varieties. It follows that the kernel of the
homomorphism, call it K(x, y, r, s, t, t′ , v), is a vector bundle. Denoting by Hv the
stabilizer of v in H (which of course acts on our Hessenberg variety), we have an
exact sequence of Hv -equivariant vector bundles on the Hessenberg variety Py (t, v):
                                          ′                           ′′
 0 → K(x, y, r, s, t, t′ , v) → g̃(x, r)/Eyt g(x, r) → Ṽ (x, r + s)/Eyt V (x, r + s) → 0.

                   2. Moy-Prasad gradings and filtrations
2.1. Moy-Prasad filtrations on representations V of G. As in the introduc-
tion we write V for V ⊗k F and g for g ⊗k F , where F = k((ǫ)). The subspace
V ⊗k k[ǫ, ǫ−1 ] of V can be written as a direct sum of the subspaces Vλ ǫm , where
(λ, m) ranges through X ∗ (A) ⊕ Z.
   Now suppose that x ∈ a. For r ∈ R we define a subspace Vx (r) of V by
                                         M
                             Vx (r) =           Vλ ǫm .
                                          λ(x)+m=r
6         MARK GORESKY, ROBERT KOTTWITZ, AND ROBERT MACPHERSON


(In other words the direct sum is taken over all (λ, m) ∈ X ∗ (A) ⊕ Z such that
λ(x) + m = r.) Thus we have
                                             M
                           V ⊗k k[ǫ, ǫ−1 ] =   Vx (r).
                                              r∈R
                  Q
Now put Vx,r := r′ ≥r Vx (r′ ). Clearly Vx,r ⊂ Vx,s if r ≥ s, so we have defined
                                   Q
an R-filtration on V. Put Vx,r+ := r′ >r Vx (r′ ). Thus we have exact sequences
                         0 → Vx,r+ → Vx,r → Vx (r) → 0.
Clearly Vx,r+ = Vx,r+δ for all sufficiently small δ > 0.
  Taking V = g, we get gx (r) and gx,r . Note that gx,r are the lattices in g defined
by Moy-Prasad [MP94]. In this way g becomes an R-filtered Lie algebra over k
and V an R-filtered g-module. In other words the action of g on V induces linear
maps
                               gx,r ⊗ Vx,s → Vx,r+s
and
(2.1.1)                    gx (r) ⊗ Vx (s) → Vx (r + s).
  Recall the subspace V (x, r) of V defined in 1.7, where r denotes r + Z, as before.
We are now going to define a canonical linear isomorphism
(2.1.2)                       ix,r : Vx (r) → V (x, r).
The space Vx (r) is the direct sum of the spaces Vλ ǫm for λ, m such that λ(x)+ m =
r. For such λ, m define a linear isomorphism Vλ ǫm → Vλ by sending vǫm to v.
The direct sum of these isomorphisms is the desired isomorphism Vx (r) → V (x, r).
Under these isomorphisms the linear map (2.1.1) goes over to the linear map (1.7.1).

2.2. Moy-Prasad subgroups of G. We denote G(F ) by G. For x ∈ a and r ≥ 0
Moy-Prasad [MP94] have defined a subgroup Gx,r of G. We abbreviate Gx,0 to
Gx , a parahoric subgroup of G. Viewing Gx,r as a pro-algebraic group over k, its
Lie algebra can be identified with gx,r . The subgroups Gx,r are normal in Gx . For
s ≥ r we have Gx,s ⊂ Gx,r . We write Gx,r+ for ∪s>r Gx,s , a subgroup of Gx,r ; for
sufficiently small δ > 0 Gx,r+δ is equal to Gx,r+ . Put Gx (r) := Gx,r /Gx,r+ .
   Let V be a representation of G and let s be a real number. Then the parahoric
subgroup Gx preserves Vx,s . Moreover, for every r ≥ 0 the subgroup Gx,r acts
trivially on Vx,s /Vx,s+r . Finally, for r > 0 there is a canonical isomorphism
                               ξx,r : Gx (r) → gx (r),
and this isomorphism has the following property. Let g ∈ Gx,r and let v ∈ Vx,s .
Then gv − v lies in Vx,r+s , and its image w in Vx (r + s) depends only on the
image ḡ of g in Gx (r) and the image vs of v in Vx (s). The property of ξx,r we are
referring to is that
(2.2.1)                           w = ξx,r (ḡ) · vs
(The right-hand side of this equation uses the map (2.1.1) induced by the action of
g on V.)

2.3. More filtrations and vector bundles. We will now see that the affine set-
up of 2.1, 2.2 produces Hessenberg varieties and vector bundles of the type studied
in 1.7.
   Suppose we have x, y ∈ a and r, t ∈ R. We define a subspace Fty Vx (r) of Vx (r)
by
                Fty Vx (r) := im[Vy,t ∩ Vx,r → Vx,r /Vx,r+ = Vx (r)].
Applying this construction to V = g and t = 0, we get
                 F0y gx (r) := im[gy,0 ∩ gx,r → gx,r /gx,r+ = gx (r)].
Analogously, for r ≥ 0 we have a subgroup
                F0y Gx (r) := im[Gy ∩ Gx,r → Gx,r /Gx,r+ = Gx (r)],
and for r > 0 the subgroup F0y Gx (r) goes over to F0y gx (r) under the isomorphism
ξx,r : Gx (r) → gx (r).
    Put H0 := Gx (0), a connected reductive group over k, and put P = F0y Gx (0),
a parabolic subgroup of H0 . Each space Vx (r) is a representation of H0 , and P
preserves the subspace Fty Vx (r). Therefore, as in section 1, we may define an H0 -
equivariant vector bundle Ety Vx (r) over P := H0 /P whose fiber over hP is equal
to hFty Vx (r).
    To see that these constructions are instances of ones made in 1.7, let us examine
Fty Vx (r) more closely. This subspace of Vx (r) is the direct sum of the spaces
Vλ ǫm for (λ, m) such that λ(x) + m = r and λ(y) + m ≥ t. These two conditions
can be rewritten as λ(x) + m = r and λ(y − x) ≥ t − r, which shows that under
the isomorphism ix,r from Vx (r) to V (x, r), the subspace Fty Vx (r) goes over to
Ft−r
  y−x V (x, r). In particular, under the isomorphism gx (r) = g(x, r), the subspace
                         −r
F0y gx (r) goes over to Fy−x g(x, r).
    Note that H0 can be identified with the group H defined in 1.7 (for the given
x ∈ a), and that this identification is compatible with the identification gx (0) =
g(x, 0) of their Lie algebras. Under this identification, the parabolic subgroup
P ⊂ H0 goes over to Py−x ⊂ H, and the representation Vx (r) of H0 goes over to
the representation V (x, r) of H. We may also identify P = H0 /P with Py−x , and
                                                             t−r            −r
then the vector bundles Ety Vx (r), E0y gx (r) go over to Ey−x   V (x, r), Ey−x g(x, r)
respectively.

                    3. Generalized affine Springer fibers
3.1. Definition of generalized affine Springer fibers. Fix y ∈ a. We write
Fy for the (partial) affine flag space G/Gy , an ind-scheme over k. For t ∈ R and
v ∈ V we define the generalized affine Springer fiber Fy (t, v) ⊂ Fy by
                          Fy (t, v) = {g ∈ G/Gy : g −1 v ∈ Vy,t },
a closed subset of Fy .
3.2. Hypotheses on t and v. We are going to analyze the structure of this gen-
eralized affine Springer fiber under the following hypotheses on t, v. We suppose
that there exist x ∈ a and s ∈ R such that
    (1) s ≥ t,
    (2) v ∈ Vx,s , and
    (3) the image v̄ of v under Vx,s → Vx (s) → V (x, s) ֒→ V is a G-good vector
        in V .
8         MARK GORESKY, ROBERT KOTTWITZ, AND ROBERT MACPHERSON


In the third condition the map Vx,s → Vx (s) is the canonical projection and the
map Vx (s) → V (x, s) is the linear isomorphism ix,s defined in 2.1.
3.3. Intersection with orbits. In order to analyze Fy (t, v) we intersect it with the
orbits of Gx in Fy . The intersections will turn out to be iterated affine space bundles
over Hessenberg varieties (and are therefore empty precisely when the Hessenberg
variety is empty).
   We first make the observation that it is enough to consider the orbit of the base-
point in Fy . Indeed, right multiplication by an element c in the normalizer of A(F )
in G(F ) induces an isomorphism from the intersection of Fcy (t, v) and the Gx -orbit
of the base-point in Fcy to the intersection of Fy (t, v) and the Gx -orbit of c times
the base-point in Fy . (Recall that c acts on a by an affine linear transformation;
cy denotes the result of this action on y.)
   The intersection of Fy (t, v) and the Gx -orbit of the base-point in Fy is equal to
                      S := {g ∈ Gx /(Gx ∩ Gy ) : g −1 v ∈ Vy,t }.

3.4. Spaces S̃r and Sr . We must analyze S, and in order to do so we introduce
some auxiliary spaces. For r > 0 put
                S̃r := {g ∈ Gx /(Gx ∩ Gy ) : g −1 v ∈ Vy,t + Vx,s+r }
and for r ≥ 0 put
              S̃r+ := {g ∈ Gx /(Gx ∩ Gy ) : g −1 v ∈ Vy,t + Vx,(s+r)+ }.
Note that S̃r+ = S̃r+δ for all sufficiently small δ > 0.
  Since v ∈ Vx,s we have g −1 v ∈ Vx,s for any g ∈ Gx , and the condition
g v ∈ Vy,t + Vx,s+r can be thought of as the condition that the image of g −1 v in
 −1

Vx,s /Vx,s+r lie in the subspace
                          im[Vy,t ∩ Vx,s → Vx,s /Vx,s+r ].
Since Gx,r is normal in Gx and acts trivially on Vx,s /Vx,s+r , we see that S̃r
(respectively, S̃r+ ) is invariant under the left action of Gx,r (respectively, Gx,r+ ),
so that we may define quotient spaces
                                   Sr :=Gx,r \S̃r
                                  Sr+ :=Gx,r+ \S̃r+
Note that Sr+ = Sr+δ for all sufficiently small δ > 0.
   Let 0 = r0 < r1 < r2 < r3 < . . . be the discrete set of values of r ≥ 0 for which
either Gx (r) or Vx (s + r) is non-trivial. We have inclusion maps
                               · · · → S̃r3 → S̃r2 → S̃r1
and these induce maps
                              · · · → Sr 3 → Sr 2 → Sr 1 .
   Note that Srj = S for sufficiently large j, and that Sri+1 = Sri + for all i ≥ 0
(in particular, Sr1 = S0+ ). Therefore, in order to show that S is an iterated
affine space bundle over a Hessenberg variety it is enough to show that S0+ is a
Hessenberg variety and that for every r > 0 the map Sr+ → Sr is an affine space
bundle. In fact we will prove a more precise statement. For each r ≥ 0 we are
going to construct a vector bundle Er over the Hessenberg variety S0+ . It will turn
out that E0 is the tangent bundle to S0+ and that Sr+ → Sr is a torsor under the
                 PURITY OF EQUIVALUED AFFINE SPRINGER FIBERS                           9


vector bundle on Sr obtained by pulling back the  P vector bundle Er by means of
Sr → S0+ . Thus the dimension of S is given by r≥0 dim Er , the sum having only
finitely many non-zero terms. However it is conceptually clearer to calculate the
dimension slightly differently, as we will do in 3.8 below.

3.5. Analysis of S0+ . We now check that S0+ is a Hessenberg variety. We use the
notation of 2.3. It is immediate from the definitions that
                       S0+ = {g ∈ H0 /P : g −1 vs ∈ Fty Vx (s)}
where vs denotes the image of v under the canonical projection Vx,s → Vx (s). It
follows from the discussion in 2.3 that S0+ equals Py−x (t − s, v̄), where v̄ is the
image of vs under the isomorphism ix,s : Vx (s) → V (x, s). Since t − s ≤ 0 and v̄ is
G-good by hypothesis, it follows that Py−x (t − s, v̄) is a Hessenberg variety.

3.6. Some auxiliary bundles. Fix a real number r > 0. Before analyzing the
fibers of Sr+ → Sr , we introduce some auxiliary bundles. Consider the map
                              p : Gx,r+ \Gx → Gx,r \Gx .
Since Gx (r) = gx (r), it is clear that p is a principal gx (r)-bundle, or in other words
a torsor under the constant vector bundle g̃x (r) over Gx,r \Gx with fiber gx (r).
   Next consider the map
                 q : Gx,r+ \Gx /(Gx ∩ Gy ) → Gx,r \Gx /(Gx ∩ Gy ).
The target of q maps to
                        Gx,0+ \Gx /(Gx ∩ Gy ) = H0 /P = P.
On P we have the vector bundle E0y gx (r), and it is easy to see that q is a torsor
under the quotient of g̃x (r) by the pullback of E0y gx (r).

3.7. Analysis of Sr+ → Sr . We continue with r and q as in 3.6. Of course Sr+ is
a closed subspace of the source of q and Sr is a closed subspace of the target of q,
and it is the restriction of q to Sr+ that gives the map Sr+ → Sr that we need to
understand.
   In order to see that Sr+ → Sr is a bundle, we begin by making the following
simple calculation. Suppose that g ∈ Gx represents an element of Sr , so that
g −1 v ∈ Vy,t + Vx,s+r . Then g represents an element of Sr+ if and only if the image
of v is 0 in
                          gVy,t + Vx,s+r         Vx (s + r)
                                            =                  .
                         gVy,t + Vx,(s+r)+     gFty Vx (s + r)
   Suppose that we replace g by gr g with g ∈ Gx,r . (In other words we are consid-
ering points in the fiber of q through the point represented by g.) Note that
                          gr gFty Vx (s + r) = gFty Vx (s + r).
Since v ∈ Vx,s we have gr−1 v ≡ v − ξx,r (gr ) · v modulo Vx,(r+s)+ . Therefore the
element of Vx (s + r)/gFty Vx (s + r) obtained from gr g differs from the one obtained
from g by the element ξx,r (gr ) · vs ∈ Vx (s + r), where vs denotes the image of v
in Vx (s). Therefore g ∈ Sr lies in the image of Sr+ if and only if the image of v in
                                     Vx (s + r)
                                    gFty Vx (s + r)
10           MARK GORESKY, ROBERT KOTTWITZ, AND ROBERT MACPHERSON


lies in the image of
                                                  Vx (s + r)
(3.7.1)                         ·vs : gx (r) →                   .
                                                 gFty Vx (s + r)
   Using the linear isomorphisms gx (r) ≃ g(x, r) and Vx (s + r) ≃ V (x, s + r)
discussed at the end of 2.1, we can rewrite this last map as
                                                      t−s−r
(3.7.2)               ·v̄ : g(x, r) → V (x, s + r)/ḡFy−x   V (x, s + r),
where ḡ denotes the image of g in Gx (0) = H0 . (Recall from 2.3 that H0 can be
identified with the group H defined in 1.7, and that V (x, s + r) is a representation
of H.) Our hypotheses guarantee that t − s − r < 0 and that v̄ is a G-good vector
in V . It then follows from 1.7 that the map ·v̄ above is surjective, and hence that
g ∈ Sr does lie in the image of Sr+ .
   Therefore Sr+ → Sr is surjective, and the analysis above (together with 3.6)
shows that the fiber of Sr+ → Sr through the point in Sr+ represented by g ∈ Gx
                                                                     −r
is equal to the kernel of the map ·v̄ above modulo gF0y gx (r) = ḡFy−x  g(x, r). This
shows that Sr+ → Sr is a torsor under the vector bundle on Sr obtained by pulling
back the vector bundle
          Er : = ker[·vs : g̃x (r)/E0y gx (r) → Ṽx (s + r)/Ety Vx (s + r)]
                                     −r                           t−s−r
               = ker[·v̄ : g̃(x, r)/Ey−x g(x, r) → Ṽ (x, s + r)/Ey−x   V (x, s + r)],
the vector bundle denoted by K(x, y − x, r, s, t − s, −r, v̄) in 1.7. Note that the
vector bundle Er is also defined for r = 0, in which case it coincides with the
tangent bundle (see 1.5) of the Hessenberg variety S0+ = Py−x (t − s, v̄).

3.8. Dimension of S. Now we are going to calculate the dimension of S. The
group Gx acts on the vector space Vx,s . Over Gx /(Gx ∩ Gy ) we have the vector
bundle whose fiber at g ∈ Gx /(Gx ∩ Gy ) is the vector space Vx,s /(Vx,s ∩ gVy,t ),
and the vector v ∈ Vx,s determines a section of this vector bundle, a section whose
zero-set coincides with S, as follows immediately from the definitions.
   In fact this section is transverse to the zero-section. In other words, the map
                               ·v : gx → Vx,s /(Vx,s ∩ gVy,t )
is surjective for every g ∈ Gx that represents a point in S, as follows from the
surjectivity of the maps (3.7.1). Transversality implies that
(3.8.1)          dim(S) = dim(gx /(gx ∩ gy )) − dim(Vx,s /(Vx,s ∩ Vy,t ).
It is clear that dim(gx /(gx ∩gy )) is the number of affine roots that are non-negative
on x and strictly negative on y. In the important special case when V = g and t = 0,
there is a similar expression for the last dimension appearing in equation (3.8.1),
and we conclude that in this special case the dimension of S is the cardinality of
(3.8.2)                {affine roots α̃ : 0 ≤ α̃(x) < s and α̃(y) < 0}.

                4. Affine Springer fibers in the equivalued case
4.1. Additional hypothesis on k. Throughout this section we assume that the
order of the Weyl group W := NG (A)/A of G is invertible in k.

4.2. G-conjugacy classes of maximal F -tori in GF . We write GF for the F -
group obtained from G by extension of scalars from k to F , and as before we write
G for G(F ). We need to review the well-known classification of G-conjugacy classes
of maximal F -tori in G.
   Let T be a maximal F -torus in GF . Fix an algebraic closure F̄ of F and let Fs
denote the separable closure of F in F̄ . Choose h ∈ G(Fs ) such that T = hAh−1 .
For σ ∈ Γ := Gal(Fs /F ) put xσ = h−1 σ(h). Then σ 7→ xσ is a 1-cocycle of Γ in
G(Fs ), whose class in H 1 (F, NG (A)) we denote by x(T ). This construction yields
a bijection from the set of G-conjugacy classes of maximal F -tori in GF to the set
                           ker[H 1 (F, NG (A)) → H 1 (F, G)].
  The obvious surjection NG (A) → W induces an injection
                             H 1 (F, NG (A)) → H 1 (F, W )
since for our particular field F it is known [Ser68] that H 1 (F, T ′ ) vanishes for
every F -torus T ′ . Denoting by y(T ) the image of x(T ) in H 1 (F, W ), we obtain an
injection T 7→ y(T ) from the set of G-conjugacy classes of maximal F -tori in GF
to H 1 (F, W ).
   In fact all elements of H 1 (F, W ) arise in this way, and we will now review a proof
of this fact, since for our purposes we need to produce an explicit maximal F -torus
T for which y(T ) is a given element of H 1 (F, W ).

4.3. Construction of T . We start with a 1-cocycle of Γ in W and are going to
construct T such that y(T ) is the class of this 1-cocycle. Since the Galois action on
W is trivial, the 1-cocycle is simply a homomorphism Γ → W .
   For any integer l not divisible by the characteristic of k we let Fl denote the
subfield of Fs obtained by adjoining an l-th root ǫ1/l of ǫ to F , and we fix a
                                                                         m
primitive l-th root ζl of 1 in k. We do this in such a way that ζlm          = ζl for all
positive integers l, m not divisible by the characteristic. Recall that Gal(Fl /F ) is
cyclic of order l, generated by the automorphism τl sending ǫ1/l to ζl ǫ1/l .
   Since |W | is not divisible by the characteristic, the given homomorphism Γ → W
comes from a homomorphism ϕ : Gal(F|W | /F ) → W , and we denote by w the
element ϕ(τ|W | ) ∈ W . Choose an element ẇ ∈ NG (A)(k) of finite order such
that ẇ 7→ w. We denote by l the order of ẇ. Note that l is not divisible by the
characteristic. Thus there is a homomorphism Gal(Fl /F ) → NG (A)(k) sending τl
to ẇ, and this homomorphism lifts the given homomorphism Gal(F|W | /F ) → W .
   The element ẇ ∈ G(k) is semisimple, so there exists a maximal torus A′ in G
such that ẇ ∈ A′ (k). We have lifted our 1-cocycle in W to a 1-cocycle in NG (A)
that takes values in A′ . In order to produce T we need to write this 1-cocycle as
the coboundary of an element in G(Fs ).
   But our 1-cocycle happens to take values in the split torus A′ , so by Hilbert’s
Theorem 90, it must be possible to construct an element b ∈ A′ (Fl ) such that
b−1 τl (b) = ẇ. To obtain an explicit element b, we note that since ẇ is an l-
torsion element in A′ (k), there exists µ ∈ X∗ (A′ ) such that µ(ζl−1 ) = ẇ. Now put
b = µ(ǫ1/l )−1 ∈ A′ (Fl ); an easy calculation shows that b−1 τl (b) = ẇ, as desired.
   Define a maximal torus T by T := bAb−1 . Since b−1 τl (b) = ẇ, it follows that
T is defined over F and that y(T ) is the class in H 1 (F, W ) we started with. This
completes the explicit construction of T .

4.4. Comparison of two filtrations on t. The appropriate context here is that
of apartments for tamely ramified tori in reductive groups over non-archimedean
local fields (see [Adl98, Yu01] for example).
    We continue with the maximal torus we just constructed. We use the maximal
torus A′ and the element x := µ/l ∈ X∗ (A′ ) ⊗Z R to obtain an R-filtration gx,s
(s ∈ R). It is one of the Moy-Prasad filtrations considered before, but for A′ rather
than A.
    Let t denote the Lie algebra of T , a Cartan subalgebra of g. We want to
understand the filtration on t induced by the filtration gx,s on g. To do so we
first extend the filtration gx,s on g to a filtration on g(Fl ) := g ⊗k Fl by putting
                                            Y
                             g(Fl )x (s) :=     gλ · (ǫ1/l )m
                                            (λ,m)

where the index set for the product is the set of (λ, m) ∈ X ∗ (A′ ) ⊕ Z such that
λ(x) + (m/l) = s, or equivalently hλ, µi + m = sl, and then putting
                                         Y
                            g(Fl )x,s :=    g(Fl )x (s′ ).
                                            s′ ≥s

     Similarly we extend the filtration g0,s on g to a filtration on g(Fl ) by putting
                                 g(Fl )0 (s) := g · (ǫ1/l )m
for s of the form m/l for m ∈ Z and setting it equal to 0 otherwise, and then
putting
                                        Y
                           g(Fl )0,s :=   g(Fl )0 (s′ ).
                                            s′ ≥s
                 ×
   The group k acts on Fl by automorphisms over k. We denote by τz ∈ Aut(Fl /k)
the automorphism obtained from z ∈ k × ; it sends ǫ1/l to zǫ1/l . This action induces
an action z 7→ idg ⊗ τz of k × on g(Fl ), and we also denote this action by τz . Using
µ, we get a new action τz′ of k × on g(Fl ), for which z ∈ k × acts by Ad(µ(z)) ◦ τz .
For the action τz′ an element z ∈ k × acts on gλ · (ǫ1/l )m by z hλ,µi+m , which shows
that g(Fl )x,s is the product of the weight spaces for the τz′ action for weights j ∈ Z
such that j ≥ sl. Similarly g(Fl )0,s is the product of the weight spaces for the τz
action for weights j ∈ Z such that j ≥ sl.
   An easy calculation shows that
                               τz′ = Ad(b) ◦ τz ◦ Ad(b)−1 .
Therefore Ad(b)−1 g(Fl )x,s = g(Fl )0,s . Moreover b−1 T b = A. This shows that when
we use Ad(b)−1 to identify Lie(TFl ) with Lie(AFl ), the subspaces g(Fl )x,s ∩ Lie(TFl )
and g(Fl )x (s) ∩ Lie(TFl ) go over to g(Fl )0,s ∩ Lie(AFl ) and g(Fl )0 (s) ∩ Lie(AFl )
respectively. Note that g(Fl )0 (s) ∩ Lie(AFl ) is Lie(A) · (ǫ1/l )m if s = m/l for some
m ∈ Z and is 0 otherwise.

4.5. Equivalued elements. We continue with T as above. Let val : Fl× → Q be
the valuation on Fl , normalized so that val(ǫ1/l ) = 1/l. Let u ∈ t and suppose that
u is regular, so that α(u) ∈ Fl× for every root α of T (over F̄ ). Suppose further
that there exists s ∈ Q such that val α(u) = s for every root α of T (over F̄ ) and
val λ(u) ≥ s for every λ ∈ X ∗ (T ), in which case we say that u is equivalued with
valuation s. (Here we are using the convention that val 0 = +∞.)

Q This hypothesis      on u can also be rephrased as saying that u′ = Ad(b)−1 u ∈
                    1/l m
   m≥ls Lie(A) · (ǫ    ) and that the projection of u′ on Lie(A) · (ǫ1/l )ls is of the
form u′′ · (ǫ1/l )ls with u′′ regular in Lie(A). It follows from our comparison of
filtrations in 4.4 that u ∈ gx,s and that the image of u under
                             gx,s → gx (s) = g(x, s) ֒→ g,
namely u′′ , is regular semisimple in g, hence is G-good in g (see 1.3, noting that
if W is non-trivial, its order is divisible by 2, so that characteristic 2 has been
excluded).
   A minor nuisance is that x lies in X∗ (A′ ) ⊗Z R rather than a. We can correct
this by replacing T, u by their conjugates under an element of G(k) that takes A′
to A. This replaces x by an element of a, which we will still call x. For this new
x and for any t ∈ R with t ≤ s we have shown that the three conditions of 3.2
are satisfied. We conclude that for any y ∈ a and t ≤ s the intersection of the
affine Springer fiber Fy (t, u) with any Gx -orbit on Py is an iterated affine space
bundle over a Hessenberg variety for Gx (0). (The Hessenberg variety depends on
the orbit.)

4.6. Weakly Coxeter tori. For convenience we now assume that the maximal
F -split torus AT in T is contained in A, so that the centralizer M of AT is a Levi
subgroup of G (over k) containing A. We further assume that T is weakly Coxeter,
so that w is a Coxeter element in WM , the absolute Weyl group of A in M . Our
lifting ẇ is a regular semisimple element in M by a result of Kostant [Kos59]. We
are free to modify ẇ by any element in the center of M ; doing so we may choose ẇ
so that it is regular in G, not just in M . Looking back at how x was defined, we see
that x lies in the interior of an alcove. Thus Gx is an Iwahori subgroup, and the
Hessenberg varieties we get are subvarieties of the flag manifold of the torus Gx (0)
and hence have either 1 or 0 elements. Thus, for weakly Coxeter T our Hessenberg
paving is a paving by affine spaces.

               5. Regular semisimple implies good when p 6= 2
   In this section we fix a prime number p and assume that our algebraically closed
ground field k has characteristic p.

5.1. Review of regularity in g. Recall from [Bor69, Prop. 11.8] that u ∈ g is
semisimple if and only if it is contained in the Lie algebra of some maximal torus
T of G, in which case it is clear that the centralizer gu of u in g contains the Lie
algebra of that maximal torus. A semisimple element u ∈ g is said to be regular if
its centralizer is as small as possible, or, in other words, is equal to the Lie algebra
of some maximal torus. We denote by grs the set of regular semisimple elements
in g.

5.2. Non-emptiness of grs . Consider elements u in the Lie algebra t of some fixed
maximal torus T in G. Then u is regular if and only α(u) 6= 0 for every root α
of T in G. By conjugacy of maximal tori, grs is non-empty if and only if the set of
regular semisimple elements in t is non-empty, and this happens if and only if no
root of T vanishes identically on t. It even suffices to look only at simple roots, since
any root is in the Weyl group orbit of a simple one. (A root vanishes identically on
t if and only if it is divisible by p in X ∗ (T ).)

   If G is adjoint no simple root is divisible by p, and therefore grs is non-empty.
On the other hand grs is in fact empty for G = Sp2n and p = 2. Since hα∨ , αi = 2,
a root is never divisible by a prime other than 2; therefore grs is non-empty if p 6= 2.
5.3. Chevalley’s restriction theorem. Chevalley’s theorem states that so long
as grs is non-empty, the restriction map from G-invariant polynomials on g to
Weyl group invariant polynomials on t is an isomorphism. We refer to Springer
and Steinberg [SS70, Section 3.17] for a proof that works in finite characteristic.
(Springer and Steinberg assume that G is adjoint, but it is routine to adapt their
proof to the more general case in which it is assumed only that grs is non-empty.)
5.4. Parallel results for g∗ . Consider the dual g∗ of g, a representation of G.
Since t is canonically a direct summand of g (with complement the direct sum of
the root subspaces for T ), we may identify the dual t∗ of t with a direct summand
of g∗ . For λ ∈ t∗ it is easy to see that the centralizer of λ in g (for the coadjoint
action of G on g∗ ) is the direct sum of t and the root subspaces gα for roots α
of T such that λ(Hα ) = 0. Here Hα := α∨ (1), in other words, the image of the
coroot α∨ in t. An element λ ∈ t∗ is said to be regular if its centralizer is as small
as possible, or, in other words, is equal to t. We denote by g∗rs the set of elements
in g∗ whose coadjoint orbit contains a regular element of t∗ .
    Considerations parallel to those above show that g∗rs is non-empty if p 6= 2 or if
G is semisimple simply connected. On the other hand g∗rs is empty for SO(2n + 1)
and p = 2.
    Finally, it is routine to transpose the proof of Springer and Steinberg from g to
g∗ , where it yields the statement that if g∗rs is non-empty, then the restriction map
from G-invariant polynomials on g∗ to Weyl group invariant polynomials on t∗ is
an isomorphism.
5.5. Goodness of elements in grs and g∗rs . Assume that both grs and g∗rs are
non-empty. Then Chevalley’s restriction theorem holds for both g and g∗ , and it is
therefore clear that there are no non-zero unstable vectors (in the sense of 1.2) in t
and t∗ . It follows easily that elements in grs and g∗rs are good vectors (in the sense
of 1.3).
