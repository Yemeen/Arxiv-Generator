                                                  is to compare two basis for G-modules, namely the standard monomial
                                                  basis and the dual canonical basis. In particular, we give a sufficient
                                                  condition for a standard monomial to be an element of the dual canon-

                                            Introduction
                                            Let G denote a semisimple, simply connected, algebraic group defined over
                                            an algebraically closed field k of arbitrary characteristic. We fix a Borel
                                            subgroup B and a maximal torus T ⊂ B, denote W the Weyl group of
                                            G with respect to T . For a dominant weight λ let V (λ) the correspond-
                                            ing Weyl module and let Q be the parabolic subgroup which normalizes a
                                            highest weight vector. Let Lλ be the corresponding ample line bundle on
                                            G/Q. Consider the embedding G/Q ֒→ P(V (λ)) given by the global sections
                                            H 0 (G/Q, Lλ ) ≃ V (λ)∗ .
                                                 The
                                                  L aim of0 standard monomial theory is to give a presentation of the ring
                                            R = n≥0 H (G/Q, Lnλ ), which is compatible with the natural subvarieties
                                            of G/Q as for example the Schubert varieties X(τ ), the opposite Schubert
                                            varieties X κ and the Richardson varieties Xτκ = Xτ ∩ X κ , τ, κ ∈ W/WQ .
                                            More precisely, the aim is to construct a basis B ⊂ H 0 (G/Q, Lλ ) such that
                                            certain (= standard) monomials of degree n in these basis elements form a
                                            basis B(nλ) for H 0 (G/Q, Lnλ ), the relations provide an algorithm to write a
                                            non-standard monomial as linear combination of standard monomials, and
                                            the restrictions {m|Xτκ | m ∈ B(nλ), m 6≡ 0 on Xτκ } of the standard monomi-
                                            als to a Richardson variety Xτκ , form a basis for H 0 (Xτκ , Lnλ ). Such a basis

                                                                                    1
has turned out to be a powerful tool in the investigation of the geometry of
Schubert (and related) varieties, see for example [13] and [16].
    The concept of an adapted algebra has been introduced by the first au-
thor in [3, 4] in connection with the Berenstein-Zelevinsky conjecture on
q-commuting elements of the dual canonical basis Cq [U − ]. Let U ⊂ B be a
maximal unipotent subgroup, let U − be its opposite unipotent subgroup and
let n− be its Lie algebra. Denote Uq (n− ) the quantized enveloping algebra
and let B ⊂ Uq (n− ) be the canonical basis. As in the classical case, one has
a non-degenerate pairing between the quantized algebra of regular functions
Cq [U − ] on U − and Uq (n− ), so Cq [U − ] is naturally equipped with a canon-
ical basis, the dual B ∗ ⊂ Cq [U − ] of the canonical basis B. This basis has
many nice properties, for example the natural injection Vq (λ)∗ ֒→ Cq [U − ] is
compatible with the basis, i.e., B ∗ (λ) = B ∗ ∩ Vq (λ)∗ is a basis for Vq (λ)∗ . So
the specialization at q = 1 provides a basis B1∗ (λ) ⊂ H 0 (G/Q, Lλ ), of which
is known that it is compatible with Schubert (and related) varieties.
    So on the one hand, B1∗ (λ) looks like a perfect candidate as a starting
basis for a standard monomial theory. The problem with this approach
is that the multiplicative structure of the dual canonical basis is hardly
understood, see [7]. The adapted algebras occur in this context, they are
maximal subalgebras of Cq [U − ] which are spanned as a vector space by a
subset S ⊂ B ∗ , and all elements of S are multiplicative, i.e., with b, b′ ∈ S
also bb′ ∈ S. In particular, their product is again an element of the dual
canonical basis! The first author has constructed in [3] for every reduced
decomposition w̌0 of the longest word w0 in the Weyl group an adapted
algebra Aw̌0 ⊂ Cq [U − ].
    On the other hand, the construction in [18] of a standard monomial
theory for the ring R provides in particular a basis for H 0 (G/Q, Lλ ), the so-
called path vectors pπ , which also has nice representation theoretic features
(see for example [13, 16, 20]), and it is a natural question to ask for the
relationship between these two bases. Recall that the path model theory
[17, 19] provides combinatorial model [8, 10] for the crystal base theory, so
we can index the the elements bπ ∈ B1∗ (λ) and the path vectors pπ by L–S
paths of shape λ.
    The main result of this article can be formulated as follows (for a more
precise and more general formulation see section 5): In the q-commutative
parts of B ∗ given by the adapted algebras Aw̌0 , the two bases coincide up
to normalization. I.e., if bπ ∈ B1∗ (λ) is the specialization of an element of an
adapted algebra Aw̌0 ⊂ Cq [U − ] for some reduced decomposition w̌0 of w0 ,
then bπ = pπ , up to normalization (multiplication by a root of unity). Vice
versa, if the chain (τ ) of Weyl group elements in the L–S path π = (τ , a)

                                         2
is compatible with some reduced decomposition of w0 , then bπ = pπ , up to
normalization. In the last section, we provide some examples to illustrate
the connection between the path basis and the dual canonical basis.


1    Notation
Let G be a complex semisimple, simply connected algebraic group with Lie
algebra g. We fix a Cartan decomposition g = n⊕h⊕n−, where b = h⊕n is a
Borel subalgebra of g with fixed Cartan subalgebra h. Let U − be a maximal
unipotent subgroup of G such that Lie U − = n and let C[U − ] be the algebra
of regular functions on U − . The left multiplication of U − on itself induces
a natural morphism φ from the enveloping algebra U (n− ) on the algebra
of differential operators on C[U − ]. This induces a natural non-degenerate
pairing on U (n− ) × C[U − ], mapping (u, f ) to the value of φ(u)(f ) at the
identity of U − .
    This pairing has an analogue in the quantum setting, i.e., one has a
natural non-degenerate pairing on Uq (n− ) × Cq [U − ]. So the algebras can be
viewed as one being the restricted dual of the other.
    Kashiwara [9] and Lusztig [22] have constructed the so-called global crys-
tal or canonical basis B of the algebra Uq (n− ). By the dual canonical basis
we mean the basis B ∗ of Cq [U − ] dual to B with respect to the pairing above.
    Some elements of B ∗ can be easily described, they correspond to so-
called extremal weight vectors in representations. Let λ ∈ P + be a domi-
nant weight and let Vq (λ) be the corresponding irreducible highest weight
representation. Fix a highest weight vector vλ , and for τ ∈ W/Wλ let vτ be
the unique weight vector in Vq (λ) of weight τ (λ) obtained in the following
way: let τ = si1 · · · sir be a reduced decomposition of τ and set

                             vτ = Fα(ni 1 ) · · · Fα(nirr ) vλ ,
                                          1


where n1 = si2 · · · sir (λ), α∨                     ∨
             
                                 
      
                               i1 , . . . , nr = λ, αir . It follows from the Verma
relations for the generators of Uq (n− ) that the vector is independent of the
chosen decomposition. This weight space is one dimensional, let bλτ ∈ Vq (λ)∗
be the unique element of weight −τ (λ) such that

                                  bλτ (vτ ) = 1.                               (1)

This linear form is considered as a form on Uq (n− ) by setting bλτ (u) =
bλτ (uvλ ). The compatibility property of the canonical basis with highest



                                              3
weight representations shows immediately that these functions bλτ are ele-
ments of B ∗ . In the following we refer to the bλτ as (λ, q)–minors. For g = sln
and λ a fundamental weight, these are exactly the quantum minors.
   It is often more convenient to forget in the notation the stabilizer Wλ
and, by abuse of notation, just write bλτ for τ ∈ W and λ ∈ P + . In this way
we can formulate the following simple product rule (see [6]):

                ∀λ, µ ∈ P + :    bλτ bµτ = bλ+µ
                                            τ      in Cq [U − ].              (2)

More generally, for ξ ∈ Vq (λ)∗ let cλξ be the linear form on Uq (n− ) obtained by
setting cλξ (u) := cλξ (uvλ ). The following commutation relation can be found
for example in [6], it is a direct consequence of [15], where the expression of
the R-matrix is made explicit: suppose ξ, η are of weight ν1 , ν2 . Then
                                                           X
                    cλξ cλη = q −(λ,λ)+(ν1 ,ν2 ) cλη cλξ +   cληi cλξi         (3)

where there exist pi ∈ C(q) and some non-constant monomials Mi such that

                    ηi ⊗ ξi = pi (q)(Mi (E) ⊗ Mi (F ))η ⊗ ξ.


2    (λ, q)–minors and adapted algebras
Recall that two elements a, b ∈ Cq [U − ] are said to q-commute if ab = q m ba
for some m ∈ Z. Two elements b, b′ ∈ B ∗ are called multiplicative if the
product is a multiple of an element of the canonical basis, i.e., bb′ = rb′′ for
some b′′ ∈ B ∗ , r ∈ C(q). The elements of the dual canonical basis are in
general neither multiplicative nor q-commuting. Let ̟1 , . . . , ̟n be the set
of fundamental weights and fix a reduced decomposition w0 = si1 · · · siN of
the longest word in W , we write w̌0 to refer to this decomposition. Set
                                                    ̟i
                 yj = si1 · · · sij and set bj := byj j ∈ B ∗ .               (4)


Remark 1 Since bλτ = bλτ′ for τ ≡ τ ′ mod Wλ , it is easy to verify the fol-
lowing description of the elements above:

                 {b1 , . . . , bN } = {b̟
                                        yj | 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ N }
                                          i



     These elements have been studied in great detail by the first author in
[3], where he shows that they have the following remarkable properties:
    i) they are multiplicative and q-commute, and, more precisely,

                                         4
                                 mN
    ii) the monomials bm1 · · · bN are, up to a power of q, elements of B .
                          1                                                ∗

Let Sw̌0 be the set of the monomials above and let Aw̌0 be the subalgebra
of Cq [U − ] spanned by Sw̌0 . Actually, Aw̃0 is generated as a space by Sw̃0 .
     These properties motivate the following definition: a subalgebra A of
Cq [U − ] is called adapted if it is spanned by a subset P ∗ ⊂ B ∗ such that
the elements in P ∗ are multiplicative and A is maximal with this property,
i.e., for all b ∈ B ∗ − P ∗ there exist a p ∈ P ∗ such that b and p are not
multiplicative.

Theorem 2 ([3]) The subalgebra Aw̌0 is adapted with the elements of Sw̌0
(up to a rescaling by a power of q) as spanning set. The set Sw̌0 is an Ore
                                                      −1                −1
set in Cq [U − ], and for the localizations one has: Sw̌ 0
                                                           Cq [U − ] = Sw̌ 0
                                                                             Aw̌0 .


3    Lusztig’s Frobenius maps
Let R be the ring of Laurent polynomials Z[q, q −1 ]. We denote UR (n− ) the
                                                           (n)
R-form of Uq (n− ) generated by the divided powers Fi . Fix a primitive
2ℓ-th root of unity ξ, where ℓ itself is even, and denote Zξ the ring Z[ξ].
    Let U (n− ) be the Zξ -form of the enveloping algebra of n− , i.e., it is
obtained from the Kostant Z-form by the ring extension Z ֒→ Zξ .
    Let Uξ (n− ) be the Zξ -algebra obtained from UR (n− ) by specialization at
q = ξ, i.e., it is obtained from the Lusztig R-form UR (n− ) by base change
with respect to R → Zξ , q 7→ ξ.
    Let A = (ai,j )1≤i,j≤n be the Cartan matrix of G and denote by t A =
(ai,j ), ai,j := aj,i , the transposed matrix. Let d = (d1 , . . . , dn ), di ∈ N, be
minimal such that the matrix (di ai,j ) is symmetric. We denote by d the
smallest common multiple of the dj . To distinguish between the objects
associated to A and t A, we add always a t in the notation. For example, we
write t g = t n− ⊕ t h ⊕ t n for the Cartan decomposition of the semisimple Lie
algebra associated to t A, and we write t Fi for the generators of Uq (t n− ).
    In the following we assume that ℓ is divisible by 2d and we set ℓ = ℓ/d
and let ℓi ∈ N be minimal such that ℓi ddi ∈ ℓZ. In [22], Chapter 35, Lusztig
defines two algebra homomorphisms:

           Fr : t Uξ (n− ) →         U (n− )       t F (m)   7→ Fi
                                                                    (m/ℓ )
                                                                         i
                                                      i
                                                      (m)            (ℓ m)
           Fr′ : U (n− )   →       t U (n− )
                                      ξ             Fi        7→ t Fi i

                 (m/ℓ )
                 i
where we set Fi    := 0 if ℓi does not divide m. The first map is in fact a
Hopf algebra homomorphism, but the second is not.


                                         5
    The corresponding R-form of Cq [U − ] is denoted Rq [U − ], and its special-
izations at ξ respectively 1 are denoted Rξ [U − ] respectively R1 [U − ]. The
two algebra homomorphisms Fr and Fr′ induce dual maps:
                                                    ∗
          Fr∗ : R1 [U − ] → Rξ [t U − ]         Fr′ : Rξ [t U − ] 7→ R1 [U − ].

Note that Fr∗ is an algebra homomorphism since Fr is a Hopf algebra ho-
momorphism. Further, since Fr ◦ Fr′ is the identity map it follows that
   ∗
Fr′ ◦ Fr∗ is the identity. In particular, Fr∗ is injective and maps R1 [U − ]
isomorphically onto a commutative subalgebra of Rξ [t U − ]
    The maps Fr respectively its dual Fr∗ are called the Frobenius maps, and
              ∗         ∗
the maps Fr′ and Fr′ are called the Frobenius splittings (for the connec-
tion with the algebraic geometric notion of Frobenius splitting in positive
characteristic see [11] and [12]).
    Of special interest are for us the (λ, q)–minors:

Proposition 3 The Frobenius map Fr∗ is an algebra homomorphism which,
restricted to the (λ, q)–minors, is the ℓ-th power map, i.e.,

                                Fr∗ (bλτ ) = (bλτ )ℓ = bℓλ
                                                        τ .

                  ∗
The splitting Fr′ is a Zξ -module homomorphism which commutes with the
image of Fr∗ , i.e., for f ∈ R1 [U − ] and g ∈ Rξ [t U − ] we have
                                 ∗                      ∗
                            Fr′ (Fr∗ (f )g) = f Fr′ (g).

In particular,
                            ∗
                        Fr′ (bm 1ℓ      mr ℓ    m1        mr
                              τ1 · · · bτr ) = bτ1 · · · bτr .

Proof. The first part follows immediately from [18], we sketch for conve-
nience the arguments: let Vξ (ℓλ) be the Uξ (t g)–Weyl module for the highest
weight ℓλ, and let L(ℓλ) be the simple module of highest weight ℓλ. Then
L(ℓλ) is nothing but the Weyl module V (λ) for U (g), viewed as quantum
module via the (extension of the) Frobenius map Fr : Uξ (t g) → U (g). One
sees easily that this induces a dual map (also) denoted Fr∗ : V (λ)∗ → Vξ (ℓλ)∗
which sends extremal weight vectors of V (λ)∗ to the corresponding extremal
weight vectors of Vξ (ℓλ)∗ . In particular, the bλτ is sent to bℓλ
                                                                τ , which is equal
     λ  ℓ
to (bτ ) by (2). The commutation part follows from [11], see also [12]. More
precisely, the assumptions made on ℓ in these articles are, as mentioned in
their introductions, just made for convenience. Suppose f ∈ R1 [U − ] and

g ∈ Rξ [t U − ]. By choosing λ ∈ P + generic enough, we can assume that we
can identify f and g as elements of representations, i.e.,
               f ∈ V (λ)∗ ֒→ R1 [U − ],      g ∈ Vξ (ℓλ)∗ ֒→ Rξ [t U − ],
        ∗
and Fr′ (Fr∗ (f )g) ∈ V (2λ)∗ ֒→ R1 [U − ]. Now the same arguments as in
[11], section 4, or [12], section 6, go through to prove the compatibility
   ∗                   ∗                                  ∗
Fr′ (Fr∗ (f )g) = f Fr′ (g). The rest is obvious since Fr′ is a splitting. •
     The canonical basis B ⊂ Uq (n− ) spans UR (n− ) as an R-module, cor-
respondingly its dual basis B ∗ spans Rq [U − ] as an R-module. It follows
that the images of this basis in Rξ [t U − ] respectively R1 [U − ] span the cor-
responding specializations.
     Fix a reduced decomposition w0 = si1 · · · siN of the longest word in W .
                                ̟i
As in section 2, set bj := byj j ∈ B ∗ ⊂ Uq (g), let Sw̌0 be the set of the
monomials in the bj . Still denote Aw̃0 the R-module generated by Sw̃0 .
The R–algebra Aw̌0 specializes to a subalgebra Aξw̌0 ⊂ Rξ [t U − ] respectively
A1w̌0 ⊂ R1 [U − ]. In both cases the algebra has the (images of the) monomials
in Sw̌0 as a basis as Zξ -module.
     As an immediate consequence of the proposition above one sees:
Corollary 4 Fr∗ induces an inclusion of algebras Fr∗ : A1w̌0 → t Aξw̌0 such
                    mN
that Fr∗ (bm1              m1 ℓ
           1 · · · bN ) = b1    · · · bmNℓ
                                       N .


4    The path model, (λ, q)–minors and SMT
We come now first back to representations of G respectively U (g). A com-
binatorial tool for the analysis of these representations is the path model,
of which we recall quickly the most important features. Let λ ∈ P + be a
dominant weight.
    Let τ = (τ0 , . . . , τr ) be a strictly decreasing sequence (with respect to the
Bruhat order) of elements of W/Wλ , and let a = (a1 , . . . , ar ) be a strictly
increasing sequence of rational numbers such that 0 < a1 < . . . < ar < 1.
The pair π = (τ , a) is called a L-S path of shape λ if the pair satisfies the
following integrality condition. For all i = 1, . . . , r:
    • set ri = l(τi−1 ) − l(τi ). There exists a sequence β1 , . . . , βri of positive
      roots joining τi−1 and τi by the corresponding reflections, i.e.,
            τi−1 > sβ1 τi−1 > sβ2 sβ1 τi−1 > . . . > sβri · · · sβ1 τi−1 = τi ,
            D                                E
      and ai τi−1 (λ), sβ1 · · · sβj−1 (βj∨ ) ∈ Z for all j = 1, . . . , ri .

                                             7
In the following formulas we set always a0 = 0 and ar+1 = 1. The weight of
an L-S path π = (τ , a) of shape λ is the convex linear combination
                  r
                  X
         π(1) =          xi+1 τi (λ), where xi = ai − ai−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ r + 1.
                   i=0

For more details on the combinatorics of L-S paths we refer to [17]. Let
B(λ) be the set of L-S paths of shape λ, and let B(λ)τ be the set of L-S
paths π = (τ , a) of shape λ such that τ ≥ τ0 . The character of the Weyl
module V (λ) of highest weight λ and the Demazure module V (λ)τ can be
calculated using the L-S paths:
Theorem 5 ([17])
                                X                                           X
           Char V (λ) =                eπ(1) and Char V (λ)τ =                      eπ(1) .
                              π∈B(λ)                                      π∈B(λ)τ

    The path model of a representation is closely connected to the combi-
natorics of the crystal base. For the irreducible representation Vq (λ) fix a
highest weight vector vλ and let B(λ) = {bvλ | b ∈ B, bvλ 6= 0} be the canon-
ical basis of Vq (λ). Denote Lq (λ) the C[q]–submodule of Vq (λ) spanned by
the elements of the canonical basis B(λ) and set

                           B q (λ) = {b mod Lq (λ) | b ∈ B(λ)}.

Recall ([10, 8]) that the Kashiwara crystal B q (λ) (with the Kashiwara op-
erators fα , eα ) is isomorphic to the crystal given by the path model B(λ)
(with the root operators). In the following we will often identify these two
crystals and just write B(λ). For an element b ∈ B(λ) we write [b]λ or just
[b] for its class in B(λ), and for an element π ∈ B(λ) we write bπ for the
element in B(λ) such that [bπ ] = π.
     The tensor products of crystals can be defined in the path model in terms
of concatenations of paths or in terms of standard tuples:

Definition 6 Let π1 = (τ , a) ∈ B(λ1 ), π2 = (κ, b) ∈ B(λ2 ), . . ., respectively
πm = (σ, c) ∈ B(λm ) be L-S paths of shape λ1 , λ2 , . . ., respectively λm ,
where

          τ = (τ0 , . . . , τr ),   κ = (κ0 , . . . , κs ), . . . ,   σ = (σ0 , . . . , σt ).

The tuple π = (π1 , π2 , . . . , πm ) is called a standard tuple of shape λ =
(λ1 , . . . , λm ) if there exist representatives τ̃0 , . . . τ̃r ∈ W of the τ0 , . . . , τr ∈

                                                   8
W/Wλ1 , and representatives κ̃0 , . . . , κ̃s ∈ W of the κ0 , . . . , κs ∈ W/Wλ2 etc.,
such that
                τ̃0 ≥ . . . ≥ τ̃r ≥ κ̃0 ≥ . . . ≥ κ̃s ≥ . . . ≥ σ̃0 ≥ . . . ≥ σ̃t ,
Such a sequence (τ̃0 , . . . , τ̃r , κ̃0 , . . . , κ̃s , . . . , σ̃0 , . . . , σ̃t ) of representatives is
called a defining chain. The weight π(1) is the sum π1 (1) + . . . + πm (1) of
the weights of the L–S paths.

Remark 7 If λ1 = . . . = λm , the condition on standardness reduces to the
condition τr ≥ κ0 ≥ κs ≥ . . . ≥ σ0 in the Bruhat ordering on W/Wλ .
    By the independence of the crystal structure of path models [19], we have
a canonical bijection between the set B(λ) of standard tuples of shape λ and
the set of L–S paths B(λ) of shape λ = λ1 + . . . + λm . In fact, the standard
tuples correspond exactly to the elements in the Cartan component of the
tensor product of the crystals. The notation bπ ∈ B(λ) for an element of the
canonical basis corresponding to an element of a path model generalizes in
the obvious way.
    The following is a translation of [14], Proposition 33, into the language
of standard tuples:
Proposition 8 Let bi ∈ B(λi ) be elements of the canonical basis and let
πi ∈ B(λi ) be the L–S path such that [bi ] = πi , i = 1, P    . . . , m. Suppose the
tuple π = (π1 , . . . , πm ) is standard, let π ∈ B(λ), λ = m       i=1 λi , be the L–S
path of shape λ that identifies with the standard tuple, and let bπ = bπ ∈ B(λ)
be such that [bπ ] = π. Then [b1 ] ⊗ . . . ⊗ [bm ] identifies with [bπ ], and for the
dual basis elements there exists a s ∈ N such that
                               q s b∗1 b∗2 . . . b∗m = b∗π mod qL∗q (λ).
    The dual representation V (λ)∗ can be geometrically realized as the space
of global sections H 0 (G/B, Lλ ) of the line bundle Lλ on G/B. We recall now
the construction of a basis of H 0 (G/B, Lλ ) using (λ, q)–minors. The restric-
tion map induces a map between (tensor products of) dual Weyl modules
of the quantum group Uξ (t g):
                             Vξ (λ)∗ ⊗ . . . ⊗ Vξ (λ)∗ −→ Vξ (ℓλ)∗ .
We write shortly bλτ · · · bλκ for the image of bλτ ⊗. . .⊗bλκ . The dual of the Frobe-
nius splitting induces a map between dual Weyl modules of the quantum
group Uξ (t g) and U (g) (see [18]):
                                       ∗
                                   Fr′ : Vξ (ℓλ)∗ −→ V (λ)∗ .

                                                    9
Note that these maps are actually defined over Zξ .
    Let now π = (τ , a) ∈ B(λ) be an L-S path of shape λ, fix ℓ ∈ N, ℓ > 0
minimal such that 2d divides ℓ and ℓai ∈ N for all i = 1, . . . , r, and let ξ be
a corresponding primitive 2ℓ-th root of unity.

Definition 9 The path vector pπ ∈ H 0 (G/B, Lλ ), π = (τ , a), is defined as:
                                                                         
                    ∗
           pπ := Fr′ (bλτ0 )ℓx1 (bλτ1 )ℓx2 · · · (bλτr−1 )ℓxr (bλτr )ℓxr+1 ,

where xi = ai − ai−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ r + 1, and the bλτj are (λ, q)-minors in
Vξ (λ)∗ for j = 0, . . . , r.

   To distinguish between extremal weight vectors for U (g) and Uξ (t g) we
keep the notation bλτ in the quantum case and write pλτ for the classical case.
The reader should think of the pπ as a kind of algebraic approximation of
                                q
                                                     ℓxr+1
                        pπ ∼  ℓ
                                  pℓx 1 ℓx2 ℓx3
                                   τ0 pτ1 pτ3 . . . pτr    .

Though the expression above does not make sense in general, we will see
soon that at least in some special cases the expression can be given a useful
interpretation.
    We will also consider standard monomials in the path vectors:

Definition 10 Let π = (π1 , . . . , πm ) be a tuple of shape λ = (λ1 , . . . , λm ).
We associate to π the monomial pπ = pπ1 pπ2 · · · pπm in H 0 (G/Q, Lλ ), where
λ = λ1 + . . . + λm . The monomial pπ is called a standard monomial of shape
λ if π is a standard tuple.

    The path vectors are defined over Zξ for some appropriate root of unity,
so the collection B(λ) of all standard monomials of shape λ is defined over
the ring S ⊂ C generated by Z and all roots of unity.

Theorem 11 ([18]) The set of standard monomials B(λ) of shape λ forms
a basis for the space of sections H 0 (G/B, Lλ ), λ = λ1 + . . . + λm .

    For more information about applications of standard monomial theory
(singularities of Schubert varieties, generators and relations for homogeneous
coordinate rings of Schubert varieties, Koszul property, Pieri-Chevalley type
formula, ...) see for example [13], [18], [16].



                                        10
5      The path vectors and the dual canonical basis
Given an L-S path of shape λ, we use the same notation pπ for the path
vector in H 0 (G/B, Lλ ) as well as the element cλpπ ∈ C[U − ]. The dual canon-
ical basis B ∗ is compatible with the injection H 0 (G/B, Lλ ) ֒→ C[U − ], i.e., a
subset of B ∗ forms a basis of the image of H 0 (G/B, Lλ ).
    So it is natural to ask for a description of the transformation matrix
between the basis given by the path vectors and the basis given by elements
of the dual canonical basis.
    Let π = (τ , a) be an L-S path of shape λ. We identify an element τ ∈
W/Wλ with its minimal representative in W . Fix a reduced decomposition
w0 = si1 · · · siN of the longest word of the Weyl group, we write w̌0 to refer
to this decomposition. For j = 1, . . . , N , set yj = si1 · · · sij as in (4).

Definition 12 We say that π is compatible with w̌0 if τ ⊂ {y1 , . . . , yN },
i.e., {τ0 , . . . , τr } ⊂ {y1 , . . . , yN }.

   Let now π = (π1 , . . . , πm ) be a standard tuple of shape λ = (λ1 , . . . , λm )
with a defining chain (see Definition 6).

                 τ̃0 ≥ . . . ≥ τ̃r ≥ κ̃0 ≥ . . . ≥ κ̃s ≥ . . . ≥ σ̃0 ≥ . . . ≥ σ̃t ,



Definition 13 We say that π is compatible with w̌0 if the defining chain can
be chosen such that {τ̃0 , . . . , τ̃r , κ̃0 , . . . , κ̃s , . . . , σ̃0 , . . . , σ̃t } ⊂ {y1 , . . . , yN }.

  The following theorem provides the connection between certain standard
monomials and the adapted algebras:

Theorem 14 Let pπ = pπ1 · · · pπm ∈ H 0 (G/B, Lλ ) be a standard mono-
mial monomial of shape λ = (λ1 , . . . , λm ). If there exists a defining chain
(τ̃0 , . . . , τ̃r , . . . , σ̃0 , . . . , σ̃t ) which is compatible with some reduced decomposi-
tion of w0 , then the inclusion H 0 (G/B, Lλ ) ֒→ C[U − ], λ = λ1 + . . . + λm ,
maps the standard monomial pπ onto the element b∗π of the dual canonical
basis, up to multiplication by a root of unity.

Proof. We fix a reduced decomposition w̌0 of w0 and assume that the stan-
dard tuple π = (π1 , . . . , πm ) has a defining chain compatible with w̌0 . Let
A1w̌0 ⊂ R1 [U − ] ⊂ C[U − ] be the corresponding (specialization of the) adapted
algebra defined in section 2. We will show that the pπj are elements of the
set of monomials Sw̌0 spanning A1w̌0 . This proves the theorem by Theorem 2.

                                                     11
   So in the following it suffices to consider only one path vector pπ . Fix an
appropriate ℓ ∈ N as in section 4, Definition 9, for π = (τ0 , . . . , τr ; a1 , . . . , ar ),
and let ξ be a primitive 2ℓ-th root of unity. Set

           mπ := (bλτ0 )ℓa1 (bλτ1 )ℓ(a2 −a1 ) · · · (bλτr−1 )ℓ(ar −ar−1 ) (bλτr )ℓ(1−ar ) ,

where the bλτj are (λ, q)–minors in Vξ (λ)∗ for j = 0, . . . , r. By definition, we
               ∗
have pπ = Fr′ (mπ ). Let λ = nj=1 λj ̟j be the expression of λ as a linear
                               P
combination of fundamental weights. Then, by (2), we know for arbitrary
τ ∈ W:
                                     n
                                          ̟
                                     Y
                               bλτ =    (bτ j )λj
                                                     i=1
So we can rewrite mπ as:
                                                                       
            n              n                              n
                ̟             ̟                             ̟
           Y               Y                             Y
   mπ =  (bτ0j )ℓa1 λj   (bτ1j )ℓ(a2 −a1 )λj  · · ·  (bτrj )ℓ(1−ar )λj 
              j=1                        i=j                                     i=j

The defining chain of π is compatible with w̌0 , it follows (see Remark 1) for
the lifts τ̃j of the τj that the b̟                     t ξ        t −
                                  τ̃j are generators of Aw̌0 ⊂ Rξ [ U ]. Note if
                                     i

                                                           ̟              ̟
τ̃ ∈ W is a lift for τ ∈ W/Wλ , then (bτ j )λj = (bτ̃ j )λj . So bπ ∈ t Aξw̌0 , and
by reordering the elements we can write with the notation as in (4):

                                         mπ = cbr11 · · · brNN ,

where c is some root of unity. If all the exponents rj are divisible by ℓ, then
we know by Proposition 3 that
                            ∗                    ∗                            r /ℓ       r /ℓ
               pπ = Fr′ (mπ ) = cFr′ (br11 · · · brNN ) = cb11 · · · bNN

is an element of Sw̌0 , the spanning set for A1w̌0 .
    To prove the divisibility property, let π = (τ0 , . . . , τr ; a1 , . . . , ar ) be an
L-S path of shape λ compatible with P   w̌0 and consider the following projec-
tion: write λ as a linear combination α λα ̟α of fundamental weights, fix
a simple root α, let τ be the class of τ in W/W̟α , and set

              πα = (τ 0 , . . . , τ r ; a1 , . . . , ar ) = (σ0 , . . . , σt ; c1 , . . . , ct ).

where the second pair of sequences is obtained from the first by omitting
repetitions among the τ j as well as the corresponding bj , i.e., if

 σ0 = τ 0 . . . = τ j−1 > σ1 = τ j = . . . = τ k−1 > σ2 = τ k = . . . = τ m−1 > . . .

                                                      12
then c1 = aj , c2 = ak , c3 = am , . . .. Set
                          ℓλα c1          ℓλα (c2 −c1 )                ℓλα (1−ct )
         m π α = b̟
                  σ0
                    α
                                    b̟
                                     σ1
                                       α
                                                            · · · b̟
                                                                   σt
                                                                     α
                                                                                        ∈ Rξ [t U − ]

Then mπ = ξ p mπα1 mπα2 · · · mπαn ∈ Rξ [t U − ] for some power p of ξ. So the
divisibility property, and hence the first part of the theorem, is a consequence
of the following lemma, and the fact that pπ and the canonical basis element
bπ coincide (up to multiplication by an appropriate root of unity) follows
from Proposition 8.

Lemma 15 Set c0 = 0 and cr+1 = 1. The exponents have the property
λα (cj+1 − cj ) ∈ Z for all j = 0, . . . , r.

Proof. Let πα = (τ 0 , . . . , τ r ; a1 , . . . , ar ) = (σ0 , . . . , σt ; c1 , . . . , ct ) be as above
and suppose

             σi−1 = τ j−1 > σi = τ j = τ j+1 = . . . = τ k−1 > σi+1 = τ k

Corresponding to the fixed reduced decomposition w̌0 let yj = si1 · · · sij
be as in (4). By assumption, π is compatible with w̌0 , so {τ0 , . . . , τr } ⊂
{y1 , . . . , yN }. It follows: there exist indices such that

                τk ≤ yt < yt sα ≤ τk−1 < . . . < τj ≤ yv < yv sα ≤ τj−1

and yt sα and yv sα are elements of {y1 , . . . , yN }. Set β = yt (α), so sβ (yt sα ) =
yt . The definition of an L-S path implies:

                   ci+1 λα = ak λα = ak hλ, α∨ i = ak hyt (λ), β ∨ i ∈ Z.

Similarly, set δ = yv (α), so sδ (yv sα ) = yv . The definition of an L-S path
implies:
                ci λα = aj λα = aj hλ, α∨ i = aj hyv (λ), δ∨ i ∈ Z.
It follows: λα (ci+1 − ci ) ∈ Z.                                                                        •


6      Examples
In this section, we study some examples which illustrate our main theorem.
Let g be semisimple Lie algebra, let B ⊂ Uq (n− ) be the canonical basis and
denote Lq (n− ) the C[q]–submodule of Uq (n− ) spanned by the elements of



                                                    13
the canonical basis B. Let (B(∞), Lq (n− )) be the crystal of Uq (n− ) (see for
example [9], or [8]), consisting of the C[q]–module Lq (n− ), the basis

                       B(∞) = {b mod Lq (n− ) | b ∈ B},

and the Kashiwara operators {fα , eα | α a simple root} on B(∞) ∪ {0}.
   In the same way as the dual canonical basis B ∗ is compatible with the
representations Vq (λ)∗ , the crystal of Uq (n− ) can be seen as the limit of
the crystals of the representations Vq (λ). Recall (section 4) that the path
model can also be understood as a combinatorial model for the crystal of
the representations.

Example 16 Let g be of type A2 , denote α1 , α2 the simple roots, then every
element b ∈ B ∗ ⊂ C1 [U − ] of the dual canonical basis is the image of some
appropriately chosen standard monomial pπ .
Proof. Let u∞ ∈ B(∞) be the highest weight element of B(∞) and let ub
be the class of b in B(∞). The element ub ∈ B(∞) can be written as

  ub = fαℓ 1 fαm2 fαn1 u∞ , where m ≥ n, or ub = fαr 2 fαs1 fαt 2 u∞ where s ≥ t,

and s = ℓ + n, r = max{n, m − ℓ} and t = min{m − n, ℓ} (see [21] or [2]).
    Note if ub = fαℓ 1 fαm2 fαn1 u∞ is such that ℓ < m−n, then in the correspond-
ing expression ub = fαr 2 fαs1 fαt 2 u∞ we have r = m − ℓ > n = ℓ + n − ℓ = s − t.
So in the following we just write ub = fαℓ i fαmj fαni u∞ and suppose that i and
j are chosen such that ℓ ≥ m − n ≥ 0.
    Set λ = (ℓ + 2n − m)̟i + (m − n)̟j , and let π λ = (id, id, id) be the
unique standard tuple of shape λ = (n̟i , (m − n)̟j , (ℓ + n − m)̟i ) of
weight π λ (1) = λ. By applying the root operators (see [19]), we get for
π = fαℓ i fαmj fαni πλ the following standard sequence of shape λ:

                   π = (π1 = (sj si ) , π2 = (si sj ) , π3 = (si )).

Note that the sequence (si sj si , si sj , si ) is a defining chain for π which is
obviously compatible with the reduced decomposition w0 = si sj si . It follows
that the image of the standard monomial pπ = psj si psj si psi of shape λ in
C[U − ] is, up to multiplication by a root of unity, the element b = bπ of the
dual canonical basis B ∗ .


Example 17 The case g = sl3 is very special, in general it is not possible
to find for every element in B(∞) an “appropriate” standard tuple of L–S

                                          14
paths with a defining chain compatible with a reduced decomposition of w0 .
An example is for g = sl4 the element b ∈ B ∗ such that for its class in B(∞)
holds ub = fα2 fα1 fα3 u∞ . Nevertheless, it is easy to see by Theorem 14, that
the other elements of B(∞) of the same weight

      ub1 = fα1 fα2 fα3 u∞ ,       ub2 = fα3 fα2 fα1 u∞ ,        ub3 = fα3 fα1 fα1 u∞

correspond all to elements of the dual canonical basis which are “standard
monomials”: b1 = p(s1 s2 s3 ) ∈ H 0 (G/B, L̟3 ), b2 = p(s3 s2 s1 ) ∈ H 0 (G/B, L̟1 )
and b3 = p(s1 s3 s2 ) ∈ H 0 (G/B, L̟2 ).
    But let now λ = ̟1 + ̟3 , then there exists an L–S path of shape λ that
corresponds under the identification between crystal graphs and path models
to ub , it is the path π = (s2 s3 s1 , s3 s1 ; 12 ). The g-module V (λ) is isomorphic
to g endowed with the adjoint action. Via this isomorphism, the canonical
basis of V (λ) is given (up to scalar multiples) by a Chevalley basis. As a
function, pπ is the dual of the canonical basis element hα2 , thus b = pπ can
again be constructed as a “standard monomial” for an appropriate choice of
λ, but this time not in the context of Theorem 14.


Example 18 We suppose again g = sl3 . Set λ = 2̟1 + 2̟2 . We shall
explicit the pπ corresponding to the zero weight space V (λ)0 of V (λ).
   Let’s introduce some notation. Let

                      a = p̟          ̟2         ̟1             ̟2
                           s 1 , b = ps 2 , c = ps 2 s 1 , d = ps 1 s 2 ,
                              1



be the elements of C[U − ] as defined in section 4. It is well known (see [3]),
that the dual canonical basis is given by {ak bl cs dt , k, l, s, t ∈ N, kl = 0}.
Moreover, it is easy to see that ab = c + d. Indeed, ab decomposes in the
base {c, d} of the subspace of C[U − ] of weight α1 + α2 . Both coefficients in
this base are equal by symmetry and equal to one by [5], Theorem 2.3.
    The LS paths corresponding to V (λ)0 are
                                1                  1                     1
           π1 = (s2 s1 , s1 ;     ), π2 = (w0 , Id; ), π3 = (s1 s2 , s2 ; ).
                                2                  2                     2
Remark that π2 is compatible with a reduced decomposition while π1 and
π3 are not. As in the proof of Theorem 9, with l = 2, we obtain, up to a
root of one,
                     pπ1 = cba, pπ2 = cd, pπ3 = dab.
Hence,
                     pπ1 = c2 + cd, pπ2 = cd, pπ3 = cd + d2 .

                                             15
Remark that pπ2 is an element of the dual canonical basis while pπ1 and
pπ3 are not. Under the identification of the path model with crystal basis
elements we have in the dual canonical basis: bπ1 = c2 , bπ2 = cd and bπ3 =
d2 , so the transformation matrix reads as: pπ1 = bπ1 + bπ2 , pπ2 = bπ2 and
p π 3 = bπ 3 + bπ 2 .


Example 19 We suppose again g = sl3 , set now λ = m̟1 + m̟2 . To
simplify the notation of the L–S paths, we still write π = (τ , a) for a =
(a1 , a2 , a3 ), even if we have equality in 0 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ 1. In case
of equality, the reader has to omit the corresponding parameters and Weyl
group elements to avoid double counting.
     We claim that the pπ have a simple expression in terms of the canon-
ical basis: if π = (τ , a) is compatible with some reduced decomposition,
then pπ = bπ is an element of the dual canonical basis (after a possible
renormalization with a root of unity).
     If π = (τ , a) is not compatible with a reduced decomposition, then let ℓ
be even and minimal with the property that ℓai ∈ N for all i. Again, after
a possible renormalization (multiplication with a root of unity):

Proposition 20 If π = (τ , a) is not compatible with a reduced decomposi-
tion, then set t = min{m(a2 − a1 ), m(a3 − a2 )}. The following transition
relation holds between the canonical basis and the path vectors:
                                   ⌊t⌋  
                                   X    tℓ
                       p(τ ;a) =               b(τ ;a1 + j ,a2 ,a3 − j )
                                         jℓ             m           m
                                   j=0


Proof. To prove the statement, we divide the set of L–S paths in groups.
The first group is the set B(λ)1 = B(λ)1,1 ∪ B(λ)1,2 , where:

      B(λ)1,1 = {π = (w0 , s1 s2 , s1 , id; a1 , a2 , a3 ) | ma1 , ma2 , ma3 ∈ N}
      B(λ)1,2 = {π = (w0 , s2 s1 , s2 , id; a1 , a2 , a3 ) | ma1 , ma2 , ma3 ∈ N}

These paths are all compatible with a reduced decomposition, so the ele-
ments pπ are canonical basis elements: Set x1 = a1 , x2 = a2 − a1 , x3 =
a3 − a2 , then, after renormalizing the pπ (multiplication by a root of unity),
we have (with same notation as above):

              bπ = pπ = am(x2 +x3 ) cmx1 dm(x1 +x2 ) for π ∈ B(λ)1,1
              bπ = pπ = bm(x2 +x3 ) cm(x1 +x2 ) dmx1 for π ∈ B(λ)1,2

                                              16
In other words, let au cv dw (respectively bu cv dw ) be an element of the dual
canonical basis such that

           v ≤ w ≤ u + v ≤ m (respectively: w ≤ v ≤ u + w ≤ m)

In both cases, this canonical basis element is equal to pπ , where
                                     v w u+v
                                       , m , m ) for au cv dw
           
              (w0 , s1 s2 , s1 , id; m
       π=                            w v u+w
              (w0 , s2 s1 , s2 , id; m , m , m ) for bu cv dw respectively
   The second set of L–S paths of shape λ is in this example the union
B(λ)2 = B(λ)2,1 ∪ B(λ)2,2 , where:

      B(λ)2,1 = {π = (w0 , s2 s1 , s1 , id; a1 , a2 , a3 ) | ma1 , 2ma2 , ma3 ∈ N}
      B(λ)2,2 = {π = (w0 , s1 s2 , s2 , id; a1 , a2 , a3 ) | ma1 , 2ma2 , ma3 ∈ N}

By construction, we get (up to multiplication by a root               of unity): Let ℓ be
minimal and even such that ℓai ∈ N for all i, then, for π             ∈ B(λ)2,1 , we have
up to multiplication by a root of unity r̃:
                    ∗
               r̃Fr′ (cmx1 ℓ dmx1 ℓ cmx2 ℓ (ab)mx3 ℓ bm(x2 −x3 )ℓ )

                                                                       if x2 ≥ x3
      pπ =          ∗
              r̃Fr′ (cmx1 ℓ dmx1 ℓ cmx2 ℓ (ab)mx2 ℓ am(x3 −x2 )ℓ )     if x3 ≥ x2

and hence by Proposition 3 for some roots of unity r ′ :
            ′ m(x −x ) mx mx ′ ∗ mx ℓ
              r b 2 3 c 1 d 1 Fr (c 2 (ab)mx3 ℓ )                     if x2 ≥ x3
      pπ =                                ∗
             r ′ am(x3 −x2 ) cmx1 dmx1 Fr′ (cmx2 ℓ (ab)mx2 ℓ )        if x3 ≥ x2 .

Replacing ab by (c + d) (note that c and d commute) we get after renormal-
izing (by a root of unity):
            mx3 ℓ mℓx3  m(x2 −x3 ) mx1 mx1 ′ ∗ m(x2 +x3 )ℓ−j j
       ( P
            j=0     j b              c     d      Fr (c             d ) if x2 ≥ x3
 pπ =    Pmx  2 ℓ mℓx2    m(x   −x   )  mx    mx     ′ ∗ m2x2 ℓ−j j
            j=0     j   a     3    2   c   1 d   1 Fr (c         d )     if x3 ≥ x2

Since 2mx2 respectively m(x2 + x3 ) are integers, it follows that Fr′ maps a
summand to zero for j not divisible by ℓ, and hence:
        ( P⌊mx ⌋
                 3  mℓx3  m(x2 −x3 ) mx1 mx1 m(x2 +x3 )−j j

             j=0

and thus, after reordering, we get for π ∈ B(λ)2,1 :
       ( P⌊mx ⌋
                 3  mℓx3  m(x2 −x3 ) m(x1 +x2 +x3 )−j mx1 +j

                     jℓ a            c              d 1                if x3 ≥ x2

             j=0


                                           17
One sees easily that in terms of the root operators one has
                          m(x1 +2x2 ) m(2x1 +x2 +x3 ) mx1
                    π = f1           f2              f1 (id),

so, by Example 16, the corresponding element bπ in the dual canonical basis
is                 m(x −x ) m(x +x +x ) mx
                     b 2 3 c 1 2 3 d 1 if x2 ≥ x3
            bπ =
                     am(x3 −x2 ) cm(x1 +2x2 ) dmx1 if x3 ≥ x2 .
i.e., bπ is the summand for j = 0 in the expression above. Note that the
exponents in the summands for pπ in (5) satisfy all the following inequalities:

          2w ≤ u + v + w ≤    2v    ≤ 2m                  for bu cv dw
          2w ≤   v+w     ≤ 2(u + v) ≤ 2m                  for au cv dw .

On the other hand, any triple (u, v, w) of integers satisfying these inequalities
gives an element of the dual canonical basis of V (λ)∗ and is hence equal to
bη for some L–S path η of shape λ. We obtain the corresponding path by
the following rules:
                                        w u+v+w v
                                          , 2m , m ) for bη = bu cv dw
              
                 (w0 , s2 s1 , s1 , id; m
          η=                            w v+w u+v
                 (w0 , s2 s1 , s1 , id; m , 2m , m ) for bη = au cv dw

In the same way one gets for π ∈ B(λ)2,2 :
       ( P⌊mx ⌋
                3 mℓx3  m(x2 −x3 ) mx1 +j m(x1 +x2 +x3 )−j
            j=0    jℓ a            c      d                     if x2 ≥ x3
  pπ =    P⌊mx2 ⌋ mℓx    m(x −x ) mx +j m(x +2x )−j                         (6)
                   jℓ b            c      d 1 2                 if x3 ≥ x2
                      2      3  2     1
            j=0

As above, in terms of the root operators one has
                          m(x1 +2x2 ) m(2x1 +x2 +x3 ) mx1
                    π = f2           f1              f2 (id),

so the corresponding element bπ in the dual canonical basis is the summand
for j = 0 in the expression above:
                    m(x −x ) mx m(x +x +x )
                      a 2 3 c 1d 1 2 3                   if x2 ≥ x3
              bπ =     m(x   −x   )  mx    m(x   +2x   )
                      b    3    2   c   1 d    1     2   if x3 ≥ x2

The exponents in the expression for pπ in (6) satisfy the following inequali-
ties:
          2v ≤ u + v + w ≤    2w    ≤ 2m                  for bu cv dw
                                                                       ,
          2v ≤   v+w     ≤ 2(u + w) ≤ 2m                  for au cv dw

                                       18
and for any triple (u, v, w) of integers satisfying these inequalities, we can
obtain the corresponding path by the following rules:
                                        v u+v+w w
                                          , 2m , m ) for bη = au cv dw
              
                 (w0 , s1 s2 , s2 , id; m
         η=                             v v+w u+v
                 (w0 , s1 s2 , s2 , id; m , 2m , m ) for bη = bu cv dw

As a consequence we can now describe in terms of the path model the sum
expressions in (5) and (6): For all π = (τ , a) ∈ B(λ)2 , a = (a1 , a2 , a3 ), we
get for t = min{mx2 , mx3 }
