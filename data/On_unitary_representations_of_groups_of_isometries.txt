                                                    U (H)? This question was asked by Su Gao. We answer the question in the affir-

                                                                                  1. Introduction
                                                For a Hilbert space H we denote by Us (H) the group of all unitary operators on
                                             H, equipped with the strong operator topology. This topology is the same as the
                                             topology of pointwise convergence, it is induced on U(H) by the product topology
                                             on H H . The group Us (H) is a topological group, in other words, its topology is
                                             compatible with its group structure.
                                                Given a topological group G, a unitary representation of G is a continuous ho-
                                             momorphism f : G → Us (H). The representation f is faithful if it is injective, and
                                             topologically faithful if f is a homeomorphic embedding of G into Us (H). Thus a group
                                             admits a topologically faithful unitary representation if and only if it is isomorphic
                                             to a topological subgroup of a group of the form Us (H).
                                                Every locally compact group G (in particular, every Lie group) admits a topo-
                                             logically faithful unitary representation. For example, the regular representation
                                             on L2 (G) is such. Beyond the class of locally compact groups the situation is less
                                             clear. There are topological groups with a countable base which do not admit any
                                             faithful unitary representation or even any faithful representation by isometries on
                                             a reflexive Banach space (Megrelishvili). For example, the group H(I) of all self-
                                             homeomorphisms of the interval I = [0, 1] has this property [2]. It follows that Is (U),
                                             the group of isometries of the Urysohn universal metric space U, also has this prop-
                                             erty, since it contains a topological copy of H(I). See [4], [5], [6] for the proof and a
                                             discussion of the space U and its group of isometries.
                                                The question arises: what are metric spaces M for which the group Is (M) of all
                                             isometries of M admits a (topologically) faithful unitary representation? We consider
                                             the topology of pointwise convergence on Is (M) (or the compact-open topology, which
                                             is the same on Is (M)). If M is locally compact and connected, the group Is (M) is
                                             locally compact [1, Ch.1, Thm.4.7] and hence embeds in a unitary group. On the
                                             other hand, if M is the Urysohn space U (which topologically is the same as a Hilbert
                                             space [7]), then Is (M) has no faithful unitary representations, as we noted above.
                                                Let H be a (real or complex) Hilbert space. Consider the topological group Is (H)
                                             of all (not necessarily linear) isometries of H. This group is a topological semidirect
                                             product of the subgroup of translations (which is isomorphic to the additive group of

H) and the unitary group U(HR ) of the real Hilbert space HR underlying H. Su Gao
asked the author whether the topological group Is (H) is isomorphic to a subgroup
of a unitary group. The aim of the present note is to answer this question in the
affirmative. It follows that the additive group of H admits a topologically faithful
unitary representation. Even this corollary does not look self-evident.
Theorem 1.1. Let H be a Hilbert space, and let G = Is (H) be the topological group
of all (not necessarily linear) isometries of H. Then G is isomorphic to a subgroup
of a unitary group.
  In Section 2 we remind some basic facts concerning positive-definite functions on
groups, and prove (a generalization of) Theorem 1.1 in Section 3.
                          2. Positive-definite functions
   For a complex matrix A = (aij ) we denote by A∗ the matrix (āji ). A is Hermitian
if A = A∗ . A Hermitian matrix A is positive if all the eigenvalues of A are ≥ 0
or, equivalently, if A = B 2 for some Hermitian B. A complex function p on a
group G is positive-definite if for every g1 , . . . , gn ∈ G the n × n-matrix p(gi−1 gj ) is
Hermitian and positive. If f : G → U(H) is a unitary representation of G, then for
every vector v ∈ H the function p = pv on G defined by p(g) = (gv, v) is positive-
definite. (We denote by (x, y) the scalar product of x, y ∈ H.) Conversely, let p
be a positive-definite function on G. Then p = pv for some unitary representation
f : G → U(H) and some v ∈ H. Indeed, consider the group algebra C[G], equip
it with the scalar product defined by (g, h) = p(h−1 g), quotient out the kernel, and
take the completion to get H. The regular representation of G on C[G] gives rise to
a unitary representation on H with the required property. If G is a topological group
and the function p is continuous, the resulting unitary representation is continuous
as well. These arguments yield the following criterion:
Proposition 2.1. A topological group G admits a topologically faithful unitary rep-
resentation (in other words, is isomorphic to a subgroup of Us (H) for some Hilbert
space H) if and only if for every neighborhood U of the neutral element e of G there
exist a continuous positive-definite function p : G → C and a > 0 such that p(e) = 1
and |1 − p(g)| > a for every g ∈ G \ U.
Proof. The necessity is easy: consider convex linear combinations of the functions pv
defined above, where v ∈ H is a unit vector. We prove that the condition is sufficient.
According to the remarks preceding the proposition, for every neighborhood U of e
there exists a unitary representation fU : G → Us (H) such that fU−1 (V ) ⊂ U for some
neighborhood V of 1 in Us (H). Indeed, pick a positive-definite function p on G such
that p(e) = 1 and
                          inf{|1 − p(g)| : g ∈ G \ U} = a > 0.
Let fU be a representation such that p(g) = (fU (g)v, v) for every g ∈ G and some
unit vector v ∈ H. Then the neighborhood
                          V = {A ∈ Us (H) : |1 − (Av, v)| < a}
of 1 in Us (H) is as required.
   It follows that the Hilbert direct sum of the representations fU , taken over all
neighborhoods U of e, is topologically faithful.                                  
               ON UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS OF GROUPS OF ISOMETRIES                             3

  Let G be a locally compact Abelian group, Ĝ its Pontryagin dual. Recall that
continuous positive-definite functions on Ĝ are precisely the Fourier transforms of
positive measures on G (Bochner’s theorem). In particular, every positive-definite
function p : Rk → C has the form
                                 Z
                          p(x) =     exp (−2πi(x, y)) dµ(y)
                                      Rk

for some positive measure µ on Rk . Here (x, y) = ki=1 xi yi for x = (x1 , . . . , xk ) and
                                                           P
y = (y1 , . . . , yk ). Let p(x) = exp (−π(x, x)). Then p is the Fourier transform of the
Gaussian measure p(y)dy and hence is positive-definite. Thus for any x1 , . . . , xn ∈ Rk
the matrix (exp (− kxi −      p xj k2 )) is positive. Here k·k is the Hilbert space norm on
Rk defined by kyk =             (y, y). If H is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and
x1 , . . . , xn ∈ H, then the finite-dimensional linear subspace of H spanned by x1 , . . . , xn
is isometric to Rk for some k. Thus we arrive at the following:
Lemma 2.2. Let H be a Hilbert space, and let x1 , . . . , xn be points in H. Then the
symmetric n × n-matrix (exp (− kxi − xj k2 )) is positive.

                           3. Proof of the main theorem
  We prove a theorem which is more general than Theorem 1.1.
Theorem 3.1. Let (M, d) be a metric space, and let G = Is (M) be its group of
isometries. Suppose that there exists a real-valued positive-definite function p : R →
R such that:
   (1) p(0) = 1, and for every ǫ > 0 we have sup{p(x) : |x| ≥ ǫ} < 1;
   (2) for every points a1 , . . . , an ∈ M the symmetric real n × n-matrix (p(d(ai , aj )))
       is positive.
Then the topological group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of a unitary group.
 In virtue of Lemma 2.2, this theorem is indeed stronger than Theorem 1.1: if
M = H, we can take for p the function defined by p(x) = exp (−x2 ).

Proof. According to Proposition 2.1, we must show that there are sufficiently many
positive-definite functions on G. For every a ∈ M consider the function pa : G →
R defined by pa (g) = p(d(ga, a)). This function is positive-definite. Indeed, let
g1 , . . . , gn ∈ G. Since each gi is an isometry of M, we have d(gi−1gj a, a) = d(gi a, gj a),
and hence the matrix (pa (gi−1gj )) = (p(d(gi−1gj a, a))) = (p(d(gi a, gj a))) is positive by
our assumption.
   Let U be a neighborhood of 1 (= the identity map of M) in G. Without loss of
generality we may assume that
                        U = {g ∈ G : d(gai , ai ) < ǫ, i = 1, . . . , n}
for some a1 , . . . , an ∈ M and some ǫ > 0. Let t be the average of the functions
pa1 , . . . , pan . Then t is a positive-definite function on G such that
                                 sup{t(g) : g ∈ G \ U} < 1.

Indeed, let δ > 0 be such that p(x) ≤ 1 − δ for every x such that |x| ≥ ǫ. If g ∈ G \ U,
then d(gai , ai ) ≥ ǫ for some i, hence pai (g) = p(d(gai , ai )) ≤ 1 − δ and
                                          n
                                      1X                     δ
                               t(g) =        pak (g) ≤ 1 − .

                                               k=1
We invoke Proposition 2.1 to conclude that G has a topologically faithful representa-
tion.                                                                              
