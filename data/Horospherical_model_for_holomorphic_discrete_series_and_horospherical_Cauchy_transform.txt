                                                                                                Introduction
                                             For some homogeneous spaces the method of horospheres delivers an effective way to decompose repre-
                                             sentations in irreducible ones. For Riemannian symmetric spaces Y = G/K horospheres are orbits of
                                             maximal unipotent subgroups of G. They are parameterized by points of the horospherical homogeneous
                                             space ΞR = G/M N where N is a fixed maximal unipotent subgroup and M = ZK (A) as usual. The
                                             horospherical transform maps sufficiently regular functions on Y to the corresponding average along the
                                             horospheres. The crucial point is, that the abelian group A acts on Ξ and that this action commutes
                                             with the action of G. The decomposition of the natural representation of G in L2 (Ξ) in irreducible ones
                                             reduces to the decomposition relative to A. In this way we obtain all unitary spherical representations
                                             on Y (with constant multiplicity), except the complementary series. The computation of the Plancherel
                                             measure on Y is equivalent to the inversion of the horospherical transform.
                                                The method of horospheres works for several other types of homogeneous spaces, including complex
                                             semisimple Lie groups (considered as symmetric spaces) but it has very serious restrictions: discrete series
                                             representations lie in the kernel of the horospherical transform, as well as all representations induced
                                             from parabolic subgroups that are not minimal. In short, the kernel is the orthocomplement of the
                                             most continuous part of the spectrum. The simplest example when the horospherical transform can
                                             not be inverted is for the group SL(2, R). In [4, 5, 6] a modification of the method of horospheres
                                             was suggested: complex horospherical transform (the horospherical Cauchy-Radon transform). For a
                                             homogeneous space X we consider the complexification XC and instead of real horospheres on X we
                                             consider complex horospheres on XC without real points (they do not intersect X). The integration along
                                             a real horosphere is equivalent to the integration of a δ-function on X with support on this horosphere. In
                                             the complex version we replace this δ-function by a Cauchy type kernel with singularities on the complex
                                             horosphere without real point. In [4, 5] it is shown that such a complex horospherical transform has
                                             no kernel for SL(2; R) and that it reproduces the Plancherel formula; in [6] it is shown for all compact
                                             symmetric spaces.
                                                The objective of this paper is to show that the complex horospherical transform has no kernel on the
                                             holomorphic discrete series. Holomorphic discrete series exist for affine symmetric spaces X = G/H of
                                             Hermitian type; G is here a group of Hermitian type [7, 21] . The corresponding part of L2 (X) can
                                             be realized as boundary values of Hardy space H2 (D+ ) in a Stein tube D+ ⊂ XC with edge X [11].
                                             Our aim is to define a complex horospherical transform which has no kernel on holomorphic H-spherical
                                             representations.

   The first step is a construction of the space that is going to be the image of the complex horospherical
transform. For that, we consider those complex horospheres in the Stein symmetric space XC = GC /HC
that are parameterized by points of the complex horospherical space Ξ = GC /MC NC . In Ξ we then
consider an orbit Ξ+ of G × T+ where T+ is an abelian semigroup in the complex torus TC = AT with
the compact torus T as the edge. The space O(Ξ+ ) of holomorphic functions on Ξ+ is the Fréchet model
of the holomorphic discrete series. More exactly, if we decompose this representation with respect to
the compact torus T we obtain G-modules which are lowest weight modules (if they are irreducible); we
obtain all such modules with multiplicity one. Using the abelian semigroup T+ we can define a Hardy
type space H2 (Ξ+ ) with spectrum ”almost all” of the holomorphic discrete series.
   The next step is a geometrical background for the construction of the horospherical transform. Firstly,
we prove that the horospheres E(ξ) parameterized by points ξ ∈ Ξ+ do not intersect X. We construct
a simple Cauchy type kernel which has no singularities on X and the edge of its singularities coincides
with E(ξ). Using this kernel we define the horospherical Cauchy transform from L1 (X) to O(Ξ+ ) which
can be extended on L2 (X). The horospherical transform decomposed under T yields the holomorphic
spherical Fourier transform.
   The last step is the inversion of the horospherical Cauchy transform. We give the Radon type inversion
formula using results from [14] for the holomorphic discrete series. Let us remark that for X = SL(2, R)
the inversion formula was obtained in [4, 5] with tools from integral geometry on quadrics. This method
automatically extends on any symmetric spaces of Hermitian type of rank 1, i.e., the hyperboloids of
signature (2, n). Let us also pay attention to the complete similarity of formulas of this paper and
formulas in [6] for compact symmetric spaces. It confirms the view that finite-dimensional spherical
representations are similar to representations of holomorphic discrete series.

                               1. Symmetric spaces of Hermitian type
The objective of this section is to set up a standard choice of terminology that will be used throughout
the text.
  Let us fix some conventions upfront. For a real Lie algebra g let us denote by gC = g ⊗R C its
complexification. Likewise, if not stated otherwise, for a connected Lie group G we write GC for its
universal complexification. If ϕ : G → H is a homomorphism of connected Lie groups, then we will also
denote by ϕ
      • the derived homomorphism dϕ(1) : Lie(G) → Lie(H),
      • the extension of ϕ to a holomorphic homomorphism GC → HC .
    Let G be a connected semisimple Lie group with Lie algebra g. We assume that G ⊂ GC and that GC
is simply connected. Let τ : G → G be a non-trivial involution and write H, resp. HC , for the τ -fixed
points in G, resp. GC . The object of concern is the affine symmetric space X = G/H. We observe that
X is contained in its complexification XC = GC /HC as a totally real submanifold. Write x0 = HC for the
base point in XC .
    Let h be the Lie algebra of H and note that g = h + q with τ |q = −idq . The symmetric pair (g, h) is
called irreducible if g does not contain any τ -invariant ideals except the trivial ones, {0} and g. In that
case, either g is simple or g = g1 × g1 with g1 simple and τ (x, x′ ) = (x′ , x). We say that X is irreducible,
if (g, h) is irreducible. From now on we will assume, that X is irreducible.
    Fix a Cartan involution θ : G → G commuting with τ . Denote by K < G the subgroup of θ-fixed
points and write Y = G/K for the associated Riemannian symmetric space. Write k for the Lie algebra
of K. Then g = k + s with θ|s = −ids . Notice that the universal complexification KC of K naturally
identifies with the θ-fixed points in GC .
    We will assume that G is a Lie group of Hermitian type, i.e. Y is Riemannian symmetric space of
Hermitian type. The assumption can be phrased algebraically: z(k) 6= {0} with z(k) the center of k.
                             HOROSPHERICAL MODEL FOR DISCRETE SERIES                                      3


   We assume that τ induces an anti-holomorphic involution on Y and then call X an affine symmetric
space of Hermitian type.
Remark 1.1. (a) Our assumptions on G and τ can be phrased algebraically, namely:
(A)                                          z(k) ∩ q 6= {0} .
Let us mention that another way to formulate (A) is to say that q admits an H-invariant regular elliptic
cone, i.e. X is compactly causal [10].
(b) Symmetric spaces of Hermitian type resemble compact symmetric spaces on an analytical level.
Combined they form the class of symmetric spaces which admit lowest weight modules in their L2 -
spectrum (holomorphic discrete series).

  Since X is irreducible, it follows that z(k) ∩ q = iRZ0 is one dimensional. It is possible to normalize
Z0 in such a way that the spectrum of ad(Z0 ) is {−1, 0, 1}. The zero-eigenspace is kC . We denote the
+1-eigenspace in sC by s+ , and the −1-eigenspace by s− .
  Let t be a maximal abelian subspace in q containing iZ0 . Then t is contained in k ∩ q. Set a = it and
note that aC = tC .
  Let ∆ be the set of roots of tC in gC ,
                         ∆n = {α ∈ ∆ | gα
                                        C ⊆ sC } = {α ∈ ∆ | α(Z0 ) ∈ {−1, 1}}

and
                            ∆k = {α ∈ ∆ | gα   C ⊆ kC } = {α ∈ ∆ | α(Z0 ) = 0} .
              ˙
Then ∆ = ∆k ∪∆n . The elements of ∆n are called non-compact roots, and the elements in ∆k are called
compact roots. We choose an ordering in it∗ such that α(Z0 ) > 0 implies that α ∈ ∆+    +
                                                                                   n ⊆ ∆ . Let W be
the Weyl group of ∆ and Wk the subgroup generated by the reflections coming from the compact roots.
As s(Z0 ) = Z0 for all s ∈ Wk , it follows that ∆+n is Wk -invariant.

1.1. Polyhedrons, cones and the minimal tubes. Set A = exp(a), AC = exp(aC ), T = exp(t) and
TC = exp(tC ). We note that
                                          AC = TC = T A ≃ T × A .
                                                        −α
   For α ∈ ∆ let α̌ ∈ a be its coroot, i.e. α̌ ∈ [gα
                                                   C , gC ] ∩ a and α(α̌) = 2. Then
                                                      X
(1.1)                                          Ω=          R>0 · α̌
                                                 α∈∆+
                                                    n

defines a Wk -invariant open convex cone in a = it which contains Z0 . Often one refers to Ω as the minimal
cone (it is denoted cmin in [10]). Let us remark that one can characterize Ω as the smallest Wk -invariant
open convex cone in a which contains a long non-compact coroot, i.e.
(1.2)                          Ω = co (Wk (R>0 · α̌))      (α long in ∆+
                                                                       n).

Here co(·) denotes the convex hull of (·).
  We set A+ = exp(Ω) and note that A+ ⊂ A is an open semigroup. Moreover
                                      T+ = T exp(Ω) = T A+ ⊂ TC
defines a semigroup and complex polyhedron with edge T . We also use the notation A− = exp(−Ω) and
T− = T A− .
   Define G-invariant subsets of XC by
                                         D± = GA± · x0 ⊂ XC .
According to [18] D+ and D− are Stein domains in XC with X = G·x0 as Shilov boundary. Subsequently
we will refer to D+ and D− as minimal tube in XC with edge X.

Set                                                 M
                                      nC = n+

                                                           C = nC ⊕ s ,
                                                   α∈∆+

                                   mC = {U ∈ hC | (∀V ∈ t) [U, V ] = 0} ,
and
                                          p C = m C ⊕ t C ⊕ nC .
Notice, that mC is contained in kC , as Z0 ∈ tC . The Lie algebra pC is a minimal θτ -stable parabolic
subalgebra of gC . Define subgroups of GC by MC = ZHC (tC ) ⊂ KC , and NC = exp(nC ).
   Note that TC = AC . Then the prescription
                                        PC = MC AC NC = MC TC NC
defines a minimal θτ -stable parabolic subgroup of GC whose Lie algebra is pC . Write Γ = MC ∩AC = M ∩T
and observe that Γ is a finite 2-group. The isomorphic map
                                (MC ×Γ AC ) × NC → PC , ([m, a], n) 7→ man
yields the structural decomposition of PC .
   We denote by t ⊆ c a τ -stable Cartan subalgebra of g contained in k. Then c = t ⊕ ch , where ch = c ∩ h.
Denote by Σ the set of roots of cC in gC . Similarly we set Σn , the set of non-compact roots, Σk , the set
of compact roots. We choose a positive system Σ+ such that Σ+ |t \{0} = ∆+ .
   Define tori in G by C = exp c and Ch = exp ch . We note that C = T Ch ≃ T ×Γ Ch .

                  2. Complex Horospheres I: Definition and basic properties
  The objective of this section is to discuss (generic) horospheres on the complex symmetric space
XC = GC /HC . We will show that the space of horospheres is GC -isomorphic to the homogeneous space
Ξ = GC /MC NC . Further we will introduce a G-invariant subdomain Ξ+ ⊂ Ξ which will be a central
object for the rest of this paper.
  Set
                                            Ξ = GC /MC NC
and write ξ0 = MC NC for the base point of Ξ. Usually we express elements ξ ∈ Ξ as ξ = g · ξ0 for g ∈ GC .
  Consider the double fibration
(2.1)                                               GC /MC

By a horosphere in XC we understand a subset of the form
(2.2)                                 E(ξ) = π2 (π1−1 (ξ))      (ξ ∈ Ξ) .
For ξ = g · ξ0 we record that
                                   E(ξ) = gMC NC · x0 = gNC · x0 ⊂ XC
(use MC ⊂ HC ).
   Similarly, for z ∈ XC we set
(2.3)                                        S(z) = π1 (π2−1 (z)) .

If z = g · x0 for g ∈ GC , then notice S(z) = gHC · ξ0 . Moreover, for z ∈ XC and ξ ∈ Ξ one has the
incidence relations
(2.4)                      z ∈ E(ξ) ⇐⇒ π1−1 (ξ) ∩ π2−1 (z) 6= ∅ ⇐⇒ ξ ∈ S(z) .
  The space of horospheres on XC shall be denoted by Hor(XC ), i.e.
                                         Hor(XC ) = {E(ξ) | ξ ∈ Ξ} .
Our first objective is to show that Ξ parameterizes Hor(XC ):
Proposition 2.1. The map
                                        E : Ξ → Hor(XC ), ξ 7→ E(ξ)
is a GC -equivariant bijection.
Proof. Surjectivity and GC -equivariance are clear by definition. It remains to establish injectivity. For
             E(ξ )
that write GC 0 for the stabilizer of E(ξ0 ) in GC . By GC -equivariance it is enough to show that
  E(ξ )
GC 0 ⊆ MC NC . Assume that g · E(ξ0 ) = E(ξ0 ). Then gNC ⊆ NC HC . In particular, g = nh ∈ NC HC .
      E(ξ )                      E(ξ )                        E(ξ )
As GC 0 is a group, and n ∈ GC 0 , it follows, that h ∈ GC 0 . By Lemma 2.2 from below it follows
that h ∈ MC . Hence g = h(h−1 nh) ∈ MC NC , as MC normalizes NC .                                       
Lemma 2.2. Assume that h ∈ HC is such that h · E(ξ0 ) = E(ξ0 ). Then h ∈ MC .
Proof. Identify the tangent space Tx0 (GC /HC ) with gC /hC . Then, as (hNC h−1 ) · x0 = NC · x0 , it follows
that
                                        Ad(h)(nC ⊕ hC ) = nC ⊕ hC .
Thus, if U ∈ nC , there exists Z ∈ nC and L ∈ hC such that Ad(h)U = Z + L. Applying (1 − τ ) this
equality, we get Ad(h)(U − τ (U )) = Z − τ (Z). As qC = (1 − τ )(nC ) ⊕ tC , and this sum is orthogonal with
respect to Killing form, it follows that Ad(h)tC = tC . In particular, h ∈ NHC (tC ).
    We recall the Riemannian dual X r = Gr /K r of X = G/H which corresponds to the Lie algebras
g = kr + sr with kr = (h ∩ k) + i(h ∩ s) and sr = i(q ∩ k) + (q ∩ s). Notice that a is maximal abelian in sr .
 r

    To continue with the proof, we observe that NHC (tC ) = NK r (a)MC . Thus we may assume that
h ∈ NK r (a). Write σr for the complex conjugation in GC with respect to the real form Gr . Then taking
σ r fixed points in hNC ∈ NC HC yields hN r ∈ N r K r with N r = Gr ∩ NC . Thus the situation is reduced
to the Riemannian case where it follows from [9], p.78.                                                    
  It is crucial to observe that there is a TC -action on Ξ which commutes with the left GC -action:
Proposition 2.3. Let ξ = g · ξ0 ∈ Ξ, g ∈ GC . For t ∈ TC the prescription
(2.5)                                            ξ · t = gt · ξ0
defines an element of Ξ. In particular,
(2.6)                                     TC × Ξ → Ξ, (t, ξ) 7→ ξ · t
defines an action of TC on Ξ, which commutes with the natural action of G on Ξ.
Proof. As TC normalizes MC NC it follows that (2.5) is defined. Finally, (2.5) implies that (2.6). defines
a left-action of TC .                                                                                   
  It is obvious that the map
(2.7)                             (GC × TC ) × Ξ → Ξ, ((g, t), ξ) 7→ g · ξ · t
is a holomorphic action of the complex group GC × TC on the homogeneous space Ξ.
   The remainder of this section will be devoted to the definition and basic discussion of an important
G × T -invariant subset Ξ+ of Ξ.

    We recall from Subsection 1.1 the polydisc T+ = T A+ and define
                                         Ξ+ = GT+ · ξ0 = GA+ · ξ0 .
We record that Ξ+ is a (G × T )-invariant subset of Ξ.
   The set GPC is open in GC and G ∩ PC = M T . Hence G/M T can be viewed as an open, complex
submanifold of the flag manifold F = GC /PC . We write F+ = GPC /PC for the image of G/M T in F and
call F+ the flag domain. Although obvious we emphasize that F+ is G-homogeneous.
   Notice G/M T is the base space of the holomorphic fiber bundle G/M ×T T+ → G/M T with fiber
T+ /Γ. There is a natural action of G × T on G/M ×T T+ given by

                 (G × T ) × (G/M ×T T+ ) → G/M ×T T+ , ((g, t), [xM, a]) 7→ [gxM, at] .
    The next lemma gives us basic structural information on Ξ+ .
Lemma 2.4. The set Ξ+ is open in Ξ = GC /MC NC . Moreover, the mapping
                                  Φ : G/M ×T T+ → Ξ, [gM, t] 7→ gt · ξ0
is a G × T -equivariant biholomorphism onto Ξ+ .
Proof. Clearly, Φ is a defined G × T -equivariant map with im Φ = Ξ+ . By the definition of the complex
structure of G/M T the holomorphicity of the map is clear, too. Let us show that Φ is injective. For that
assume that g1 t1 · ξ0 = g2 t2 · ξ0 , gj ∈ G, tj ∈ T+ . By G-equivariance we may assume that g2 = 1. Then
g1 ∈ G ∩ PC = M T and w.lo.g. we may assume that g1 ∈ M . Consequently, as TC ∩ MC NC = Γ, we
obtain t1 ∈ t2 Γ, i.e. [M, t1 ] = [M, t2 ]. Hence Φ is injective.
   A standard computation yields that dΦ is an immersion and a simple dimension count shows that
dim G/M T + dim T+ = dim Ξ. In particular, Φ is a submersion and im Φ = Ξ+ is open, concluding the
proof of the lemma.                                                                                     

2.1. Fiberings. To conclude this section we mention three natural fibrations in relation to Ξ+ and F+ .
   Write S + = exp(s+ ) and recall that the map
                                 Y = G/K → GC /KC S + , gK 7→ gKC S +
is a G-equivariant open embedding. Henceforth Y will be understood as an open subset of the flag
manifold GC /KC S + .
Lemma 2.5. The following assertions hold:
      (i) The natural map
                                        Ξ+ → F+ , zMC NC 7→ zPC
          is a holomorphic fibration with fiber T+ /Γ.
     (ii) The natural map
                                           F+ → Y, gM T 7→ gK
           is a holomorphic fibration with fiber the flag variety K/M T .
     (iii) The natural map
                                           Ξ+ → Y, gt · ξ0 7→ gK
          is a holomorphic fibration with fiber K/M ×T T+ .
Proof. (i) follows from G ∩ PC = M T and (ii) is obvious. Finally (iii) is a consequence (i) and (ii).   

                                3. The G × T -Fréchet module O(Ξ+ )
   The natural action of G×T on Ξ+ gives rise to a representation of G×T on the Fréchet space O(Ξ+ ) of
holomorphic functions on Ξ+ . We will decompose O(Ξ+ ) with respect to this action. By the compactness
of T , it is clear that O(Ξ+ ) decomposes discretely under T . It turns out that each T -isotypical component
is the section module of a holomorphic line bundle over the flag domain F+ and that all such section
modules arise in this manner.
   In the second part of this section we turn our attention to G×T -invariant Hilbert spaces of holomorphic
functions on Ξ+ . By definition these are unitary G × T -modules H with continuous G × T -equivariant
embeddings into O(Ξ+ ). There are many interesting examples such as weighted Bergman and weighted
Hardy spaces. We will discuss the Hardy space H2 (Ξ+ ) on Ξ+ with constant weight and show that
H2 (Ξ+ ) constitutes a natural model for the the H-spherical holomorphic discrete series of G.
3.1. The decomposition of O(Ξ+ ). In Section 2 we exhibited a natural action of G × T on Ξ+ , namely

(3.1)                           (G × T ) × Ξ+ → Ξ+ , ((g, t), ξ) 7→ g · ξ · t .
We recall that O(Ξ+ ) becomes a Fréchet space when endowed with the topology of compact convergence.
Remark 3.1. Finite dimensional representation theory of GC shows that Ξ (and hence Ξ+ ) is holomor-
phically separable. In particular O(Ξ+ ) 6= {0}.
  Denote by GL(O(Ξ+ )) the group of bounded invertible operators on O(Ξ+ ).
  The action (3.1) induces a continuous representation of G × T on O(Ξ+ ):

                   L ⊗ R : G × T → GL(O(Ξ+ )), ((L ⊗ R)(g, t)f ) (ξ) = f (g −1 · ξ · t−1 ) ,
(g, t) ∈ G × T , f ∈ O(Ξ+ ), and ξ ∈ Ξ+ .
   We first decompose O(Ξ+ ) under the action of the compact torus T . Denote by Td          /Γ the character
group of T /Γ, i.e. Td/Γ = Homcont (T /Γ, S1 ). In the sequel we identify Td
                                                                           /Γ with the lattice

                             Λ = {λ ∈ a∗ | ∀U ∈ (exp |t )−1 (Γ) λ(U ) ∈ 2πiZ} .
Explicitly, to λ ∈ Λ one associates the character χλ (tΓ) = eλ(log t) . Often we will write tλ for χλ (tΓ).
  The assumption that GC is simply connected allows an uncomplicated description of the lattice Λ.
                    n                            o
                                         hλ,αi
Lemma 3.2. Λ = λ ∈ a∗ | (∀α ∈ ∆) hα,αi         ∈Z .
                                              hλ,αi
Proof. ′′ ⊆′′ : Let λ ∈ Λ. We first show that hα,αi ∈ Z for all α ∈ ∆k . For that observe that the compact
symmetric space K/H ∩ K embeds into G/H via the natural map
                                   K/H ∩ K → G/H, k(H ∩ K) 7→ kH .
                                         hλ,αi                                                   ′′
Thus [8], Ch. V, Th. 4.1, yields that    hα,αi   ∈ Z for all α ∈ ∆k . To complete the proof of        ⊆′′ we still
                 hλ,αi
have to verify       ∈ Z for all α ∈ ∆n . Fix α ∈ ∆n . Standard structure theory implies that there is an
                 hα,αi                                                           
                                                                              i 0
embedding of symmetric Lie algebras (su(1, 1), so(1, 1)) → (g, h) such that         ∈ su(1, 1) is mapped
                                                                              0 −i
to iα̌ ∈ t. As GC is simply connected, we thus obtain an immersive map SU(1, 1)/SO(1, 1) → G/H. In
            hλ,αi
particular, hα,αi ∈ Z must hold.
  ′′                     hλ,αi
      ⊇′′ : Suppose that hα,αi ∈ Z holds for all α. Recall the extension t ⊆ c of t to a compact Cartan
subalgebra of g. In the sequel we consider λ as an element of c∗ which is trivial on c ∩ h. On p. 537 in [8],
it is shown that λ is analytically integral for C = exp c (again this needs that GC is simply connected).

In particular λ defines an element χλ ∈ T̂ . It remains to show that χλ |Γ = 1. As M = ZH∩K (a) and
Γ = M ∩ T , this reduces to an assertion on the compact symmetric space K/H ∩ K, where it follows
from [8], Ch. V, Th. 4.1.                                                                         

    For each λ ∈ Λ define the λ-isotypical component of O(Ξ+ ) by


(3.2)                       O(Ξ+ )λ = {f ∈ O(Ξ+ ) | (∀t ∈ T ) R(t)f = tλ f } .
As (R, O(Ξ+ )) is a continuous representation of the compact torus T on a Fréchet space, the Peter-Weyl
theorem yields
                                                    M
(3.3)                                    O(Ξ+ ) =      O(Ξ+ )λ
                                                     λ∈Λ

  Each O(Ξ+ )λ is a G-module for the representation L. In order to describe them explicitly we recall
some facts on holomorphic line bundles.
  For λ ∈ Λ we write Cλ for C when considered as a M T -module with trivial M -action and T acting
by χλ . Recall that G/M T inherits a complex manifold structure through its identification with the flag
domain F+ . In particular, to each λ ∈ Λ one associates the holomorphic line bundle
(3.4)                                      Lλ = G ×MT C−λ .
Write O(Lλ ) for its G-module of holomorphic sections, i.e. O(Lλ ) consists of smooth functions f : G → C
such that
        • f (gmt) = t−λ f (g) for g ∈ G, t ∈ T and m ∈ m.
        • G/M T → Lλ , gM T 7→ [gM T, f (g)] is holomorphic.
    The restriction of Lλ to the flag variety K/M T yields the holomorphic line bundle
                                           Kλ = K ×MT C−λ
over K/M T . Write Λ0 for the   ∆−
                                 k -dominant   elements of Λ, i.e.

                                                                  	
(3.5)                            Λ0 = λ ∈ Λ | (∀α ∈ ∆+
                                                     k ) hλ, αi ≤ 0 .

  According to Bott [1], Vλ = O(Kλ ) is of finite dimension, and non-trivial if and only if λ ∈ Λ0 . By
Lλ = G ×MT C−λ ≃ G ×K (K ×MT C−λ ) we retrieve the standard isomorphism
                                         O(Lλ ) ≃ O(G ×K Vλ ) .
In particular,
(3.6)                               O(Lλ ) 6= {0}     ⇐⇒      λ ∈ Λ0 .
   We remind the reader that the T -weight spectrum of πλ is contained in λ + Z≥0 [∆+ ]. In particular,
O(Lλ ), if irreducible, is a lowest weight module for G with respect to the positive system ∆+ and lowest
weight λ.
   Finally we establish the connection between O(Ξ+ )λ and O(Lλ ). For that let us denote by Ξ0 the
pre-image of F+ in Ξ, i.e.
                                              Ξ0 = GTC · ξ0 .
Notice that Ξ+ ⊂ Ξ0 . Holomorphicity and T -equivariance yield O(Ξ+ )λ = O(Ξ0 )λ . Likewise holds for
O(Lλ ). Thus holomorphic extension and restriction gives a natural G-isomorphism O(Ξ+ )λ ≃ O(Lλ ).
  We summarize our discussion.
                              HOROSPHERICAL MODEL FOR DISCRETE SERIES                                      9


Proposition 3.3. The G × T -Fréchet module O(Ξ+ ) decomposes as
                                              M
                                     O(Ξ+ ) =      O(Ξ+ )λ .
                                                           λ∈Λ0

Moreover, holomorphic extension and restriction canonically identifies O(Ξ+ )λ with the section module
O(Lλ ).
  We conclude this subsection with some comments on unitarization of the section modules O(Lλ ).
Remark 3.4. Let λ ∈ Λ0 and let us denote by O(Lλ )K−fin the (g, K)-module of K-finite sections of
O(Lλ ). Let us assume that O(Lλ )K−fin is irreducible. Then O(Lλ )K−fin identifies with the generalized
Verma module N (λ) = U(gC ) ⊗U (kC +s− ) Vλ and the Shapovalov form on N (λ) gives rise to the (up to
scalar unique) contravariant Hermitian form on O(Lλ )K−fin . We say that O(Lλ )K−fin is unitarizable
if the Shapovalov form is positive definite. Another way to formulate it is that there exists a unitary
lowest weight representation (πλ , Hλ ) such that the (g, K)-module of K-finite vectors HλK−fin is (g, K)-
isomorphic to O(Lλ )K−fin . In this situation O(Lλ ) is then naturally G-isomorphic to the hyperfunction
vectors Hλ−ω of πλ .
    We want to emphasize that not all λ ∈ Λ0 correspond to unitarizable modules O(Lλ )K−fin (a necessary
condition is λ|Ω ≥ 0 and we refer to [3] for more precise information). However, we want to stress that
O(Lλ )K−fin is automatically unitarizable if λ|Ω is sufficiently positive (for example if condition (3.12)
below is satisfied).
3.2. The Hardy space on Ξ+ . The objective of this section is to introduce the Hardy space on Ξ+ and
to prove some of its basic properties.
   We begin with some measure theoretic preliminaries. The groups GC and MC NC are unimodular, and
hence Ξ = GC /MC NC carries a GC -invariant measure µ.
   Recall that M is a compact subgroup of G and denote by dm a normalized Haar measure on M .
Further we let dg and d(gM ) denote left G-invariant measures on G, resp. G/M , normalized subject to
the condition                   Z             Z   Z
                                   f (g) dg =         f (gm) dm d(gM )
                                  G                 G/M        M
for all f ∈ L1 (G).
   Notice that the stabilizer in G of any point ξ ∈ T+ · ξ0 ⊂ Ξ+ is the compact subgroup M . In particular
one has
                                   Z                       Z
(3.7)                                     f (g · ξ) dg =           f (g · ξ) d(gM )
                                      G                     G/M
for all ξ ∈ T+ · ξ0 and integrable functions f on Ξ+ .
   Write k·k2 for the L2 -norm on L2 (G). Let us remark that the representation (R, O(Ξ+ )) of T naturally
extends to a representation of the semigroup t ∈ T− ∪T , also denoted by R. Furthermore if f ∈ O(Ξ+ ) and
t ∈ T− then we can define the restriction of R(t)f to G by R(t)f |G : G → C by R(t)f |G (g) = f (gt−1 · ξ0 ).
The Hardy norm of f ∈ O(Ξ+ ) is defined by
                                          Z
(3.8)                        kf k2 = sup     |f (gt · ξ0 )|2 dg = sup kR(t)f |G k22 .
                                      t∈T+    G                         t∈T−

Let
(3.9)                              H2 (Ξ+ ) = {f ∈ O(Ξ+ ) | kf k < ∞} .

and hence T− acts on H2 (Ξ+ ) by contractions. Note, that R(t)f |G is right M -invariant, and, by the

             is an isometry into L2 (G/M ).
Proof. The proof follows a standard procedure and will be more a sketch. We refer to [11], in particular
the proof of Theorem 2.2, for a detailed discussion of the underlying methods.
   Let ξ ∈ Ξ+ . Then there exist relatively compact open sets UG ⊆ G and UT ⊆ T+ such that ξ ∈
UG UT · ξ0 . Thus, there is a constant c > 0 such that the Bergman-type estimate
                                     Z
                                               |f (ξ)|2 dµ(ξ) ≤ c · kf k2
                                           UG UT ·ξ0

holds for all f ∈ H (Ξ+ ). This implies that H2 (Ξ+ ) is complete, and that point evaluations are continu-
                      2

ous.
   Write C+ = {z ∈ C | Im(z) > 0} for the upper half plane and fix Z ∈ iΩ. We notice that the map
T− ∋ t 7→ R(t)f |G ∈ L2 (G) is well defined and holomorphic. Hence
                              Lf : C+ → L2 (G/M ); Lf (z) = R(exp(zZ))f |G ∈ L2 (G/M )
defines a holomorphic function on C+ .
   By Lemma 2.3 in [11] it follows, that limz→0 Lf (z) exists, and is monotonically increasing as s ց 0
along each line segment exp(siZ), or, because of the right invariance of dg, on each t exp(siZ), t ∈ T . As
in [11], one shows, that this limit is independent of Z. Thus, we get a boundary value map β : H2 (Ξ+ ) →
L2 (G/M ), defined by
                                             β(f ) = lim R(t)f |G .
                                                          t→e
By the definition of the Hardy space norm, we obviously have
                                                   kβ(f )k2 ≤ kf k .
But, as the norm kR(exp(sZ))f k2 is monotonically increasing for s ց 0, it follows that
                                              kR(exp(sZ))f k2 ≤ kβ(f )k
for all s ∈ R+ . Thus
                                                kR(t)f |G k ≤ kβ(f )k .
It follows, that β : H (Ξ+ ) → L (G) is an isometry, and hence H2 (Ξ+ ) is a Hilbert space.

   Clearly L ⊗ R defines a unitary representation of G × T on H2 (Ξ+ ). We are going to decompose
     2
H (Ξ+ ) with respect to this action. As before we begin with the decomposition under T . For λ ∈ Λ the
λ-isotypical component of H2 (Ξ+ ) is given by H2 (Ξ+ )λ = H2 (Ξ+ ) ∩ O(Ξ+ )λ . The Peter-Weyl theorem
yields the orthogonal decomposition
                                                           M
(3.11)                                        H2 (Ξ+ ) =          H2 (Ξ+ )λ

of H (Ξ+ ) in G-modules.
   We draw our attention to the unitary G-modules H2 (Ξ+ )λ inside of O(Ξ+ )λ .

  Suppose that H2 (Ξ+ )λ 6= {0}. Then O(Lλ ) 6= {0} and the restriction mapping
                                            H2 (Ξ+ )λ → O(Lλ )
gives a G-equivariant embedding. Moreover β(H2 (Ξ+ )λ ) ⊂ L2 (G). Thus H2 (Ξ+ )λ is a module of the
holomorphic discrete series of G. In terms of λ this means that λ satisfies the Harish-Chandra condition
[7]
(3.12)                               hλ − ρ(c), αi > 0       (∀α ∈ Σ+
                                                                    n),
                 P
where ρ(c) = 12 α∈Σ+ α.
   Write Λsd for the set of all λ ∈ Λ0 which satisfy (3.12).
   Conversely, let λ ∈ Λsd and write Hλ for a corresponding unitary lowest weight module with lowest
weight λ. Denote by vλ ∈ Hλ a normalized lowest weight vector and write d(λ) for the formal dimension
(see [7] or (5.13) below). It is then straightforward that
                                                        p                          

defines a G-equivariant isometric embedding. Hence H2 (Ξ+ )λ ≃ Hλ 6= {0}.
   Summarizing our discussion we obtain the Plancherel decomposition for H2 (Ξ+ ).
Proposition 3.6. As a G-module the Hardy space decomposes as
                                                 M
                                     H2 (Ξ+ ) ≃     Hλ .
                                                         λ∈Λsd

Remark 3.7. (a) The set Λsd describes the set of all H-spherical unitary lowest weight representations
(up to equivalence) whose matrix coefficients are square integrable on G, i.e. Λsd is the spectrum of the
H-spherical holomorphic discrete series of G.
(b) Later we well mainly deal with the spectrum Λ2 of the holomorphic discrete series on X. One has
                                                 Λ2 ⊆ Λsd
with equality precisely for the equal rank cases [20, 21].

                4. Complex Horospheres II: Horospheres with no real points
We continue our discussion of complex horospheres from Section 2. We will introduce the notion of
horosphere without real points and investigate Ξ+ with respect to this property. In addition we will
prove some dual statements for the minimal tubes D± .
Definition 4.1. We say that the complex horosphere E(ξ) ⊂ XC has no real points if E(ξ) ∩ X = ∅. We
denote by Ξnr ⊂ Ξ the subset of those ξ which correspond to horospheres with no real points.
Lemma 4.2. The set Ξnr is a G-invariant subset of Ξ.
Proof. Let ξ ∈ Ξnr and g ∈ G. Assume, that x ∈ E(g · ξ) ∩ X. Then g −1 x ∈ E(ξ) ∩ X, contradicting the
assumption that E(ξ) has no real points.                                                            

   Recall the open G-invariant subset Ξ+ = GA+ · ξ0 ⊂ Ξ. In the sequel it will be useful to consider with
Ξ+ its pre-image Ξ  e + in GC , i.e.
                                            Ξe + = GA+ MC NC .
                 e + is a left G and right MC NC invariant open subset of GC .
It is clear that Ξ
   Next we draw our attention to the Zariski open subset NC AC HC of GC . Our objective is to study Ξ e+
in relation to NC AC HC .

Remark 4.3. Notice that Ξ  e −1 ⊂ NC AC HC is equivalent to G ⊂ NC AC HC . However the latter is true
                             +
only for rank X = 1, i.e. dim t = 1. In general, G ∩ NC AC HC is an open and dense subset of G (cf.
Theorem 4.5 below).
     There is a right HC and left NC -invariant holomorphic middle-projection
                                       aH : NC AC HC → AC /Γ, z 7→ aH (x)
In particular, for each λ ∈ Λ we obtain natural (NC , HC )-invariant holomorphic maps
                                         NC AC HC → C, x 7→ aH (x)λ .
The holomorphic function NC AC · x0 → AC /Γ induced by aH shall also be denoted by aH .
  The function aH enables us to give a useful geometric description of horospheres.
Lemma 4.4. Let ξ = g · ξ0 ∈ Ξ for g ∈ GC . Then
                  E(ξ)   =   {z ∈ XC | g −1 z ∈ NC AC · x0 , aH (g −1 z) = Γ}
                         =   {z ∈ XC | g −1 z ∈ NC AC · x0 , aH (g −1 z)λ = 1   for all λ ∈ Λ}
Proof. ′′ ⊆′′ : If z ∈ E(ξ), then z = gn · xo for some n ∈ NC . Thus g −1 z = n · ξ0 ∈ NC AC · x0 and
aH (g −1 z) = aH (n · x0 ) = Γ.
  ′′
     ⊇′′ : Conversely, let z ∈ XC be such that g −1 z ∈ NC AC · x0 and aH (g −1 z) = Γ. ¿From the first
condition follows that g −1 z = na · x0 for some n ∈ NC and a ∈ AC ; the second condition implies a ∈ Γ.
Thus z ∈ g · ξ0 , as was to be shown.                                                                 
     We define a subset of Λ0 by
(4.1)                     Λ≥0      = {λ ∈ Λ0 | λ|Ω ≥ 0}
                                                                            	
(4.2)                              =   λ ∈ Λ | λ|Ω ≥ 0, (∀α ∈ ∆+

The following theorem is the main geometric result of the paper.
Theorem 4.5. The following assertions hold:
    (i) G ∩ NC AC HC is open and dense in G.
   (ii) Let λ ∈ Λ≥0 . Then the function aλH |G∩NC AC HC extends to a continuous function on G and
                                            |aH (g)λ | ≤ 1   (g ∈ G).
Proof. The approach to prove this theorem lies in the use of the structural decomposition
(4.3)                                              G = KAq H
where Aq = exp(aq ) with aq ⊆ s ∩ q a maximal abelian subspace.LThere is a natural way to construct
a flat aq out of the weight space decomposition gC = aC + mC + α∈∆ gα          C . It will be briefly reviewed.
                                                                                                            γ
Let γ1 , . . . , γr ∈ ∆+n be a maximal set of long  strongly orthogonal roots.  Then one can find Zj ∈ gCj ,
j = 1, . . . , r, such that
                                                 M r

                                                   j=1

is a maximal abelian subspace of s ∩ q; further

(see [10], p. 210-211 for all that).
   (i) As S + ⊆ NC , we obtain from (4.3) and (4.5) that
                                                G ⊂ NC KA− HC .

Hence it is sufficient to show that

(4.6)                    KA− ∩ NC+ AC (HC ∩ KC )      is open and dense in KA−
    To continue, we first have to recall some facts related to the Iwasawa decomposition of KC . Write
Ne + for a maximal C-stable unipotent subgroup of KC containing N + and set A        e = exp(ic). Then
   C                                                                      C
         e + e
KC = NC AK is an Iwasawa decomposition of KC . We recall that Ω and hence A− is Wk -invariant. Thus
Kostant’s non-linear convexity theorem (cf. [8], Ch. IV, Th. 10.5) implies that KA− ⊂ ÑC+ A− K. As
Ne + ⊂ N + MC and A ⊆ A     e ⊆ AMC , we thus get KA− ⊂ N + A− MC K. In particular, in order to establish
   C       C                                                C
(4.6) it is enough to verify that K ∩ NC+ AC (HC ∩ KC ) is dense in K. But this is known (for example it
follows from Lemme 2.1 in [2]).
    (ii) In the proof of (i) we have seen that G ⊂ NC MC A− KHC . Thus we only have to show that aλH can
be defined as a holomorphic function on KC with |aH (ak)λ | ≤ 1 for all k ∈ K and a ∈ A− . For that let
(τλ , Vλ ) denote the holomorphic (HC ∩ KC )-spherical representation of KC with lowest weight λ. Write
(·, ·) for a K-invariant inner product on Vλ . Let vλ be a normalized lowest weight vector and vH be the
spherical vector with (vH , vλ ) = 1. Then for all x ∈ NC+ AC (HC ∩ KC ) ⊂ KC we have
                                        (πλ (x)vH , vλ ) = aH (x)λ .
As the left hand side has a holomorphic extension to KC , the same holds for aλH . Finally, for a ∈ A− and
k ∈ K we have
                                         aH (ak)λ = aλ aH (k)λ .
Observe that aλ ≤ 1 as λ ∈ Λ≥0 and that |aH (k)λ | ≤ 1 for all k ∈ K by Lemma 2.3 in [2]. This completes
the proof of (ii).                                                                                       

We have shown:
Corollary 4.9. Let λ ∈ Λ≥0 be such that λ|Ω > 0. Then, aλH |D− ∩NC AC ·x0 extends to a holomorphic
function on D− such that
                                 |aH (x)λ | < 1  (x ∈ D− ) .
   We recall the definition of the orbits S(z) ⊂ Ξ for z ∈ XC (cf. equation 2.3). The convexity inclusion
(4.9) delivers the dual statement to Corollary 4.7:
Corollary 4.10. S(z) ∩ G/M = ∅ for all z ∈ D− .
Proof. Let z = ga · x0 for g ∈ G and a ∈ A− . Suppose that S(z) ∩ G/M 6= ∅. As S(z) = gaHC · ξ0 , this
is equivalent to aHC NC ∩ G 6= ∅. In other words Ga ∩ NC HC 6= ∅; a contradiction to (4.9).         

context we would like to mention that the results in this section remain true for Ω replaced by Ω̃, the
obvious adjustment of Λ≥0 understood.

                               5. The horospherical Cauchy transform
Our geometric results from Section 4 enable us to define a natural horospherical Cauchy kernel on Ξ+ .
The kernel gives rise to the horospherical Cauchy transform L1 (X) → O(Ξ+ ). The main result is a
geometric inversion formula for the horospherical Cauchy transform for functions in the holomorphic
discrete series on X.

5.1. The horospherical Cauchy kernel. In this subsection we define the horospherical Cauchy kernel
and the corresponding horospherical Cauchy transform. We will introduce the holomorphic spherical
Fourier transform and relate it the horospherical Cauchy transform.
   To begin with we have to recall some features of the root system ∆. Let us denote by
                                               Π = {α1 , . . . , αm }
                                                        −
a basis of ∆ corresponding to the positive system ∆+
                                                   n ∪ ∆k . As Spec ad(Z0 ) = {−1, 0, 1}, it follows that
exactly one member of Π is non-compact, say αm . Define weights ω1 , . . . , ωm ∈ a∗ by

                                       hωi , αj i
                                                  = δij     (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) .
                                       hαj , αj i
Set
                               Λ>0 = Z≥0 · ω1 + . . . + Z≥0 · ωm−1 + Z>0 · ωm .
Recall the definition of Λ≥0 from (4.1).
Lemma 5.1. The following assertions hold:
       (i) ωi |Ω > 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In particular, λ|Ω > 0 for all λ ∈ Λ>0 .
      (ii) Λ≥0 = Z≥0 · ω1 + . . . + Z≥0 · ωm . In particular, Λ>0 ⊂ Λ≥0 .
                                HOROSPHERICAL MODEL FOR DISCRETE SERIES                                       15

                                    P
Proof. (i) Fix x ∈ Ω. Then x = α∈∆+      n
                                            kα α̌ with kα > 0. Now each α ∈ ∆+   n can be uniquely expressed
                                 −
as α = αm + γ with γ ∈ Z≥0 [∆k ]. Moreover if α = β is the highest root, then γ ∈ Z>0 [α1 , . . . , αn−1 ]. As
kβ > 0, the assertion follows.
   (ii) Set Λ′≥0 = Z≥0 · ω1 + . . . + Z≥0 · ωm . We first show that Λ′≥0 ⊆ Λ≥0 . For that let λ ∈ Λ′≥0 , say
     Pm                                                                                        hλ,αi
λ = i=1 ki ωi with ki ∈ Z≥0 . As α1 , . . . , αn−1 constitutes a basis of ∆−
                                                                           k , it follows that hα,αi ∈ Z≤0 for
all α ∈ ∆+                                             ′
          k . Furthermore, λ|Ω ≥ 0 by (i). Hence Λ≥0 ⊆ Λ≥0 .
                                    ′
                                                                          Pm
   Finally we establish Λ≥0 ⊆ Λ≥0 . For that fix λ ∈ Λ≥0 . Then λ = i=1 ki ωi with some real numbers
                                                                                   hλ,αi
ki . We have to show that ki ∈ Z≥0 . Now λ ∈ Λ≥0 means in particular that          hα,αi   ∈ Z≤0 for all α ∈ ∆+
                                                                                                              k.
        hλ,αi i
Hence hα  i ,αi i
                  ∈ Z≥0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. It remains to show that hαhλ,αmi
                                                                          m ,αm i
                                                                                  ∈ Z≥0 . Integrality is clear.
Also since R≥0 · αˇm constitutes a boundary ray of the cone Ω, non-negativity follows.                       
  Define the horospherical Cauchy kernel on Ξ+ as the function
                                                   m−1
                                                   Y
                                         1                  1
                       K(ξ) =                    ·                            (ξ ∈ Ξ+ ) .
                                aH (ξ −1 )−ωm − 1 j=1 1 − aH (ξ −1 )ωj

In view of Corollary 4.6 and Lemma 5.1(i), the function K is holomorphic, left H-invariant and bounded
on subsets of the form GU · ξ0 for U ⊂ A+ compact.
   This allows us to define for a function f ∈ L1 (X) its horospherical Cauchy transform by
                                        Z
                                fb(ξ) =    f (x) · K(x−1 ξ) dx   (ξ ∈ Ξ+ ) .
                                          X
We notice that the horospherical Cauchy transform is a G-equivariant continuous map
                                         L1 (X) → O(Ξ+ ), f 7→ fb.
Remark 5.2. (a) The horospherical Cauchy kernel K is tied to the geometry of the minimal cone Ω:
there is no larger WK -invariant open convex cone Ω̃ such that K would be holomorphic on G exp(Ω̃) · ξ0
(this follows from Lemma 5.1 and (1.2)). In this context we wish to point the difference to the results of
Section 4 which are valid for a wider class of convex cones (cf. Remark 4.12).
(b) For each λ ∈ Λ0 and ξ ∈ Ξ+ consider the complex hypersurface
                                  L(λ, ξ) = {z ∈ XC | aH (ξ −1 z)λ − 1 = 0}
in XC . Their intersection is E(ξ) and they do not intersect X. The singular set of the horospherical
Cauchy kernel is the union of the m hypersurfaces L(ωi , λ) and the edge of this set is just E(ξ). It means
that if f is boundary value of a holomorphic function on D+ then fb is a residue on E(ξ).
   The horospherical Cauchy transform can be decomposed in its constituents associated to the elements
λ ∈ Λ>0 . More precisely, for λ ∈ Λ>0 and f ∈ L1 (X) let us define fbλ ∈ O(Ξ+ ) by
                                             Z
                                    b
                                    fλ (ξ) =   f (x) · aH (ξ −1 x)λ dx .
                                                X

We will call the map λ 7→ fbλ ∈ O(Ξ+ ) the spherical holomorphic Fourier transform of f .
Lemma 5.3. The following assertions hold:
   (i) Let U ⊂ A+ be a compact subset. The series
                                   X
                                        aH (ξ −1 )λ          (ξ ∈ Ξ+ )
                                        λ∈Λ>0

         converges uniformly on GU · ξ0 ⊂ Ξ+ .

     (ii) For all ξ ∈ Ξ+ one has

   We conclude from Lemma 5.3 that the horospherical Cauchy transform of a function f ∈ L1 (X) can
be decomposed as
                                               X
                                          fb =      fbλ
                                                          λ∈Λ>0

with the right hand side converging uniformly on compacta.
Remark 5.4. We wish to point out that the horospherical Cauchy kernel is a product of geometrical
and not functional analytic reasoning. We emphasize that in general not all parameters λ ∈ Λ>0 in the
decomposition of the horospherical Cauchy kernel correspond to unitarizable lowest weight modules (see
Remark 5.6 below for a more detailed discussion).
5.2. Holomorphic Fourier transform on lowest weight representations. The objective of this
subsection is to give a more detailed discussion of the holomorphic Fourier transform for functions f ∈
L2 (X) which are contained in lowest weight module.
   To begin with we collect some material on spherical unitary lowest weight representations. A reasonable
source might be the overview article [16].
   Let (πλ , Hλ ) be a non-trivial H-spherical unitary lowest weight representation of G. As before we
denote by vλ a normalized lowest weight vector. Write vH for the unique H-fixed distribution vector
which satisfies hvλ , vH i = 1.
   We record the fundamental identity


(5.1)                                aH (x)λ = hπλ (x)vH , vλ i          (x ∈ X) ,
which allows us to link our geometric discussion in Section 4 with representation theory.
Remark 5.5. It follows from Corollary 4.9 that aλH admits a holomorphic extension to the minimal
tube D− . Traditionally this fact was explained via (5.1) in the context of holomorphic extension of
unitary lowest weight modules (see [18]). We wish to point out that Corollary 4.9 asserts more, namely
that aλH |D− is bounded by 1. In addition Corollary 4.9 is more geometric, i.e. not restricted to unitary
parameters λ.

  Pairing the G-module of smooth vectors Hλ∞ with vH yields the G-equivariant embedding

                                                                           
(5.2)                        ι : Hλ∞ → C ∞ (X), v 7→ x 7→ hπλ (x−1 )v, vH i .

We say that πλ is X-square
                     p      integrable if there exists a constant ds (λ) > 0, the spherical formal dimension
(cf. [14]), such that ds (λ) · ι extends to an isometric map Hλ → L2 (X).
   X-square integrable parameters λ are characterized by the condition [21]

(5.3)                                 hλ − ρ, αi > 0      for all α ∈ ∆+
                                                                       n .
           P
Here ρ = 12 α∈∆+ mα α with mα = dimC gα    C.
  Likewise we say πλ is X-integrable if ι(HλK−fin ) ⊂ L1 (X). Integrability is described by the inequality

(5.4)                                hλ − 2ρ, αi > 0       for all α ∈ ∆+
                                                                        n .

   The set of parameters λ ∈ Λ>0 which satisfy condition (5.4), resp. (5.3), shall be denoted by Λ1 , resp.
Λ2 . Note that Λ1 ⊂ Λ2 .

Remark 5.6. We will discuss the lattice Λ>0 with regard to Λ1 and Λ2 . One recognizes a strong
dependence on the multiplicities mα which Pn we will exemplify for three basic cases below. Recall that
elements λ ∈ Λ>0 are described by λ = i=1 λi ωi with λi ∈ Z≥0 and λm > 0. In addition let us keep in
mind that conditions (5.3) and (5.4) are equivalent to hλ − ρ, αm i > 0, resp. hλ − 2ρ, αm i >P0.
                                                                                                m
   The equal rank case: In this situation one has t = c and mα = 1 for all α. Thus ρ = 21 i=1 ωi and
                   Pm          1                                                 1
therefore λ − ρ = i=1 (λi − 2 )ωi . In particular hλ − ρ, αm i = hαm , αm i(λm − 2 ) and thus Λ>0 ⊂ Λ2 as
λm ≥ 1 for elements λ ∈ Λ>0 .                                              P
   The group case: In this situation one has mα = 2 for all α and so ρ = ni=1 ωi . Accordingly we obtain
hλ − ρ, αm i = hαm , αm i(λm − 1). It follows that Λ>0 parameterizes the holomorphic discrete series and
their limits; in particular Λ2 ⊂ Λ>0 .                                                         
   The rank one case: Here one has Λ>0 = Z>0 · ω and ρ = m2α α. Thus Λ2 = (Z>0 + m2α )ω and
Λ2 ⊂ Λ>0 with equality precisely for mα = 1, i.e. g = sl(2, R).

  For λ ∈ Λ2 we set L2 (X)λ = ι(Hλ ).

Lemma 5.7. Let λ, µ ∈ Λ2 . Fix v ∈ Hλ and define f (x) = hπλ (x−1 )v, vH i ∈ L2 (X)λ . Then for all
ξ ∈ Ξ+ , the function
                                        X → C, x 7→ f (x)aH (ξ −1 x)µ
is integrable and
                                Z
                                                               δλµ
(5.5)                                f (x)aH (ξ −1 x)µ dx =          hv, πλ (ξ)vλ i .
                                 X                            ds (λ)
Here
                    πλ (ξ)vλ = a−λ πλ (g)vλ ∈ Hλ        for ξ = ga · ξ0 , g ∈ G and a ∈ A+ .

Proof. Fix ξ ∈ Ξ+ . Holomorphic extension of (5.1) yields

                                       aH (ξ −1 g)µ = hπλ (g)vH , πλ (ξ)vλ i

for all g ∈ G and ξ ∈ Ξ+ . It follows that x 7→ aH (ξ −1 x)µ is square integrable on X. Thus x 7→
f (x)aH (ξ −1 x)µ is integrable. Finally we apply Schur-orthogonality (cf. [14], Prop. 3.2) and obtain

                                                                                                                       
  For λ ∈ Λ1 let us write L1 (X)λ for the closure of ι(HλK−fin ) in L1 (X). The next lemma can be
understood as an L1 -version of Schur-orthogonality for the Cauchy-transform.
Lemma 5.8. Let λ ∈ Λ1 . Then
                                               fb = fbλ                for all f ∈ L1 (X)λ .

Proof. Fix f ∈ L1 (X)λ . We have to show that fbµ = 0 for all µ ∈ Λ>0 \{λ}. For µ ∈ Λ2 this is a
consequence of Lemma 5.7. Therefore, we may assume that µ ∈ Λ>0 \Λ2 . It means that condition (5.3)
is violated which we will express as
(5.6)                                                      hµ − ρ, αm i ≤ 0 .
     We now show that
                                       Z
                           fbµ (ξ) =           f (x)aH (ξ −1 x)µ dx = 0                  for all ξ ∈ Ξ+ .
                                           X

Equation above has boundary values on G/M ⊂ ∂Ξ+ and it will be sufficient to prove that
                                 Z
                       b
                      fµ (gM ) =    f (x)aH (g −1 x)µ dx = 0 for all g ∈ G .
                                               X
We compute
                                                           Z
                               fbµ (gM ) =                      f (x)aH (g −1 x)µ dx

                                                   =    f (gx)aH (x)µ dx

                                                   =        f (tgx)aH (tx)µ dx dt

                                                     Z Z                 
                                                   =          t f (tgx) dt aH (x)µ dx .
                                                               µ
                                                           X            T
                                                           R       µ
To arrive at a contradiction, suppose that T t f (tgx) dt 6= 0. This can only happen if µ belongs to the
T -weight spectrum of πλ . Now the T -weights of πλ are contained in λ + Z≥0 [∆+ ]. Thus µ = λ + γ for
some γ ∈ ∆+ . But then
                                  hµ − ρ, αm i = hλ − ρ, αm i + hγ, αm i .
Observe that both summands on the right hand side are positive, the desired contradiction to (5.6)                     

Remark 5.9. (Analytic continuation) Let λ ∈ Λ1 and f ∈ L1 (X)λ ∩L2 (X)λ . Write f (x) = hπλ (x−1 )v, vH i
for some v ∈ Hλ . Then Lemma 5.7 and Lemma 5.8 imply
                                                                     1
(5.7)                                              fb(ξ) =                hv, πλ (ξ)vλ i .
                                                                   ds (λ)

Clearly, the right hand side makes sense for all v ∈ Hλ and all X-square integrable parameters λ ∈ Λ2 .
We now explain how passing to parameters λ ∈ Λ2 in (5.7) has a natural explanation in terms of analytic
continuation. For that let G̃ denote the universal cover of G. Write Λ̃1 , Λ̃2 for the sets of G̃-integral
parameters which satisfy (5.4), resp. (5.3). Clearly Λ1,2 ⊂ Λ̃1,2 . The effect of passing to the universal
cover is that the parameter spaces involved become continuous in the central variable, i.e. there exists
constants 0 < c2 < c1 such that
                      Λ̃1 |RZ0 =]c1 , ∞[·(αm |RZ0 )   and Λ̃2 |RZ0 =]c2 , ∞[·(αm |RZ0 ) .
By the concrete formula for ds (λ) from [14], Th. 4.15, we know that λ 7→ ds (λ) is a meromorphic
function on a∗C which is positive on Λ̃2 . Now familiar techniques show that that the assignment Λ̃2 ∋
λ 7→ ds1(λ) hv, πλ (ξ)vλ i ∈ C becomes analytic in the central variable (the Shapovalov form is polynomial
in λ and in [13] it is explained how to make consistent analytic choices for v and vλ in dependence of the
central coordinate of λ).
   Motivated by Remark 5.9 we define the horospherical Cauchy transform for functions f ∈ L2 (X)λ ,
λ ∈ Λ2 by
                                             fb = fbλ .

5.3. Hyperfunctions and generalized matrix coefficients. In order to discuss the horospherical
Cauchy transform and its inverse in a more comprehensive way we need some results on the analytic
continuation of generalized matrix coefficients of lowest weight representations. Proofs of the facts cited
below can be found in [15].
   Let (π, H) be a unitary lowest weight representation of G. Write Hω and H−ω for the associated
G-modules of analytic, resp. hyperfunction vectors. The nature of the T -spectrum of π shows that π|T
extends holomorphically to T− . Moreover the so obtained self adjoint operators π(a), a ∈ A− , are of
trace class and strongly mollifying, i.e
(5.8)                                  π(a)H−ω ⊂ Hω            (a ∈ A− ) .
   Assume that π is H-spherical and denote by vH the (up to scalar) unique H-fixed distribution vec-
tor. Let v ∈ H−ω be a hyperfunction vector. We wish to interpret the generalized matrix coefficient
f (x) = hπ(x−1 )v, vH i as a generalized function on X = G/H. It follows essentially from (5.8) that the
prescription
(5.9)                 f˜(ga · x0 ) = hπ(g −1 )π(a−1 )v, vH i     for g ∈ G and a ∈ A+ .
defines a holomorphic function on D+ = GA+ · x0 . The minimal tube D+ has X as edge and this allows
us to interpret f as the boundary value of f˜. Henceforth we will identify f with the holomorphic function
f˜.
    Suppose that H ⊂ L2 (X), i.e. π = πλ with λ ∈ Λ2 and H = L2 (X)λ . We now show how the
horospherical Cauchy transform restricted to L2 (X)λ can be extended to L2 (X)−ω    λ  ⊂ O(D+ ). In other
words for ξ ∈ Ξ+ we wish to give meaning to
                                           Z
                                fb(ξ) =        f (x)aH (ξ −1 x)λ dx
                                             X
                                           Z
                                      =        hπ(x−1 )v, vH iaH (ξ −1 x)λ dx
                                              X

as a holomorphic function on Ξ+ . Express ξ as ξ = ga · ξ0 with g ∈ G and a ∈ A+ . By the usual
holomorphic change of variables one obtains that

                                    Z
                        fb(ξ)   =        f (x)aH (a−1 g −1 x)λ dx
                                    X
                                    Z
                                =        hπ(x−1 )π(g −1 )π(a−1 )v, vH iaH (x)λ d(x) .
                                    X
Now the last expression is well defined by (5.8). Of course one has
                                              1
(5.10)                              fb(ξ) =        hπ(a−1 )π(g −1 )v, vλ i
                                            ds (λ)
by the same argument as in Lemma 5.7. Thus we have shown that the horospherical Cauchy transform
on L2 (X)λ extends to a G-equivariant continuous map
                                            L2 (X)−ω
                                                  λ → O(Ξ+ )λ .
  We conclude this section with a conjecture related to the holomorphic intertwining of O(D+ ) and
O(Ξ+ ). It can be seen as a holomorphic analogue of Helgason’s conjecture (actually a theorem ny [12]).
  In order to state the conjecture some new terminology is needed. Let us call a holomorphic function
f on Ξ+ bounded away from the boundary if its restriction to gT+ a is bounded for all choices of g ∈ G
and a ∈ A+ . We denote by Ob.a.b. (Ξ+ ) the space of all holomorphic function on Ξ+ which are bounded
away from the boundary. Note that Ob.a.b.(Ξ+ ) is a closed G-subspace of the Fréchet space O(Ξ+ ).
Conjecture 1. Let D(X) be the algebra of G-invariant differential operators on X. Naturally we can
view D(X) as holomorphic differential operators on XC . Write O(D+ )λ for the common holomorphic
D(X)-eigenfunctions on D+ with infinitesimal character λ − ρ. Let λ ∈ Λ2 . We conjecture
(5.11)                                   Ob.a.b. (D+ )λ = L2 (X)−ω
                                                                λ  .
Notice that the inclusion ′′ ⊃′′ is clear by (5.8).
   We have already remarked that O(Ξ+ )λ ≃ Hλ−ω [15]. Hence our conjectured equality means that the
horospherical Cauchy transform induces an intertwining isomorphism Ob.a.b. (D+ )λ → O(Ξ+ )λ .
   It is also interesting problem to formulate (and prove) the conjecture for other parameters.
Remark 5.10. We illustrate Conjecture 1 for the one-sheeted hyperboloid X = Sl(2, R)/SO(1, 1). Fix
λ ∈ 2Z>0 = Λ2 and denote by Hλ , resp. H−λ , the lowest (resp. highest) weight module of G = Sl(2, R)
with lowest (resp. highest) weight λ, resp. −λ. Denote by Vλ−2 the finite dimensional G-module of
highest weight λ − 2. Write C ∞ (X)λ for the D(X)-eigenspace with eigenvalue λ − 1. Then
                                        C ∞ (X)λ ≃ Hλ∞ ⊕ H−λ
                                                          ∞
                                                             ⊕ Vλ−2
                         ∞
Now, the functions of H±λ   extend holomorphically to D± but not beyond, while the functions of Vλ−2
extend holomorphically to all of XC . One deduces that O(D+ )λ = Hλ−ω ⊕ Vλ−2 . Finally, the holomorphic
functions in Vλ−2 grow exponentially at infinity and hence are not bounded away from the boundary.
Thus Ob.a.b. (D+ )λ = L2 (X)−ω
                            λ   as conjectured.
5.4. Inversion of the horospherical Cauchy transform. To begin with we first have to explain
certain facts on incidence geometry between the Shilov boundary X of D+ and the boundary piece G/M
of Ξ+ .
   We keep in mind that we realized G/M in the boundary of Ξ+ by G/M ≃ G · ξ0 ⊂ ∂Ξ+ .
   Recall the orbits S(z) ⊂ Ξ from 2.3. For a point x ∈ X we define the real form of S(x) by

                                          SR (x) = S(x) ∩ G/M .
In view of the incidence relation (2.4), one has
                       SR (x) = {ξ ∈ G/M | ξ ∈ S(x)} = {ξ ∈ G/M | x ∈ E(ξ)} .

Lemma 5.11. Let x = g · x0 ∈ X, g ∈ G. Then
                                           SR (x) = gH · ξ0 ≃ H/M .
Proof. First notice that for x = g · x0 with g ∈ G one has SR (x) = g · SR (x0 ). Hence it suffices to show
that
                                          SR (x0 ) = H · ξ0 ≃ H/M .
Let ξ ∈ SR (x0 ) and write ξ = y · ξ0 for some y ∈ G. We have to show that y ∈ H and that y is uniquely
determined modulo M . First observe that ξ ∈ S(x0 ) means yNC ⊂ HC NC and so y ∈ HC NC ∩ G. Now
HC NC ∩ G = H implies y ∈ H. Finally, uniqueness modulo M is immediate from Lemma 2.2.                    
   It is possible to view the boundary orbits SR (x) as certain limits. For z = ga · x0 ∈ D+ we define
                                          SR (z) = gaH · ξ0 ≃ H/M .
We note that SR (z) ⊂ Ξ+ by (4.10). Furthermore there is the obvious limit relation
                                          lim SR (ga · ξ) = SR (g · x0 ) .
                                          a→1
                                         a∈A+


   Write dz (ξ) for the measure on SR (z) which is induced from a Haar measure d(hM ) on H/M via the
identification SR (z) ≃ H/M . Define the space of fiber integrable holomorphic functions on Ξ+ by
                                                    Z
               Of.i. (Ξ+ ) = {φ ∈ O(Ξ+ ) | D+ ∋ z →       |φ(ξ)| dz (ξ) is locally bounded} .
                                                           SR (z)
   For a function φ ∈ Of.i. (Ξ+ ) we define its inverse horospherical transform φ∨ ∈ O(D+ ) by
                                           Z
                                  φ∨ (z) =        φ(ξ) dz (ξ)   (z ∈ D+ ) .
                                                SR (z)

We note that
                                        Of.i. (Ξ+ ) → O(D+ ), φ 7→ φ∨
is a G-equivariant continuous map.
   Finally, we define a subset Λc ⊂ Λ2 of large parameters by

                           Λc = {λ ∈ Λ2 | (∀α ∈ ∆+n ) (λ − ρ)(α̌) > 2 − mα } .
   The inversion formula for the horospherical Cauchy transform is based on the following key result.

In other words, f = d(λ) · (fb)∨ .
Proof. Let f (ga · ξ0 ) = hπλ (a−1 )πλ (g −1 )v, vH i for some v ∈ Hλ−ω . Then by (5.10)
                                                  1
                                           fb(ξ) =     hv, πλ (ξ)vλ i .

As λ ∈ Λc , [14], Th. 2.16 and Th. 3.6, imply that

with the left hand side understood as convergent Hλ−ω -valued integral.
   Thus with z = ga · x0 one obtains that

                                                  λ , then the integral SR (z) f (ξ) dz (ξ) does not converge.
However, using the results from [14] it can be shown that the identity (5.12) can be analytically continued
(cf. Remark 5.9) to all λ ∈ Λ2 . Henceforth we understand (5.12) as an identity valid for all λ ∈ Λ2 .
   The formal dimension d(λ) is a polynomial in λ, explicitly given by [7]
                                                 Y
(5.13)                                d(λ) = c ·    hλ − ρ(c), αi
                                                       α∈Σ+

with c ∈ R a constant depending on the normalization of measures.
   The right action of T on Ξ+ induces an identification of U(tC ) with G-invariant differential operators
on Ξ+ . As usual we identify U(tC ) with polynomial functions on tC . In this way d(λ) corresponds to
a G-invariant differential operator L on Ξ+ which acts along the fibers of Ξ+ → F+ and has constant
coefficients in logarithmic coordinates. In particular,
                                        Lφ = d(λ) · φ         (φ ∈ O(Ξ+ )λ ) .
Combining this fact with equation (5.12) we obtain the main result of this paper.

                            6. The example of the hyperboloid of one sheet
This section is devoted to the discussion of the case G = Sl(2, R) and H = SO(1, 1). Notice that
G/H ≃ SOe (2, 1)/SOe (1, 1). For what follows it is inconsequential to assume that G = SOe (2, 1) and
H = SOe (1, 1) although the universal complexification of G = SOe (2, 1) is not simply connected.
  The map
                                                              

                               X = {x = (x1 , x2 , x3 )T ∈ R3 | x21 + x22 − x23 = 1} .
The base point x0 becomes (1, 0, 0)T . Let us define a complex bilinear pairing on C3 by
                                                                        

                  hz, wi = z1 w1 + z2 w2 − z3 w3     for z = z2  , w = w2  ∈ C3 .

If we set ∆(z) = hz, zi for z ∈ C3 , then X = {x ∈ R3 | ∆(x) = 1}. Further one has GC = SO(2, 1; C) ≃
SO(3, C) and HC = SO(1, 1; C) ≃ SO(2, C). Clearly
                                     XC = GC /HC = {z ∈ C3 | ∆(z) = 1} .

The homogeneous space GC /MC NC naturally identifies with the isotropic vectors Ξ = {ζ ∈ C3 \{0} |
∆(ζ) = 0} via the GC -equivariant map
                                                                        

The correspondence between elements of ζ ∈ Ξ and horospheres on XC is explicitly given by
                                  ζ ↔ E(ζ) = {z ∈ XC | hz, ζi = 1} .
Elements ζ ∈ Ξ can be expressed as ζ = ξ + iη with ξ, η ∈ R3 \{0} subject to
                                  ∆(ξ) = ∆(η)         and       hξ, ηi = 0 .
A simple computation yields

                               Ξ+ = {ζ = ξ + iη ∈ Ξ | ∆(ξ) = ∆(η) > 1}
and
                               D+ = {z = x + iy ∈ XC | ∆(x) > 1} .
  Next we compute the kernel function.
Lemma 6.1. For all z ∈ XC and ζ ∈ Ξ one has
                                         aH (ζ −1 z)−α = hz, ζi .
Proof. We first show that
(6.1)                            aH (g)−α = hg · x0 , ζ0 i       (g ∈ GC ) .
Observe that both sides are holomorphic functions on GC which are left NC and right HC -invariant.
Thus it is enough to test with elements a ∈ AC . Then aH (a)−α = a−α . On the other hand for a =

   cos θ sin θ 0
− sin θ cos θ 0 with θ ∈ C we specifically obtain
     0       0    1
                                                    
                                             cos θ      1

                                               0        0
This proves (6.1).
   It is now easy to prove the asserted statement of the lemma. For that write ζ = g · ζ0 and z = y · x0
for g, y ∈ GC . Then (6.1) implies

product on a be normalized such that hα, αi = 1 and identify R with a∗ by means of the bijection
