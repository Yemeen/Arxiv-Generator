                                             1     Introduction
                                             In this paper we present an example of elaborate categorical structures hidden in very simple algebraic
                                             objects. We look at the algebra of polynomial differential operators in one variable x, also known as the
                                             Weyl algebra, and its irreducible representation in the ring of polynomials Q[x]. We construct an abelian
                                             category C whose Grothendieck group can be naturally identified with the ring of polynomials and define
                                             exact functors FX : C → C and FD : C → C such that
                                                 (a) on the Grothendieck group K(C) of the category C functors FX and FD act as the multiplication by
                                             x and differentiation, respectively,
                                                 (b) there is a functor isomorphism FD FX ∼   = FX FD ⊕ Id, which lifts the defining relation ∂x = x∂ + 1 of
                                             the Weyl algebra,
                                                 (c) functors FX and FD have nice adjointness properties: FX is left adjoint to FD and right adjoint to
                                             FD , twisted by an automorphism of C.
                                                 The category C is the direct sum of categories Cn over all n ≥ 0, where Cn is the category of finite
                                             dimensional representations of the nilCoxeter algebra An , which is generated by Yi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, subject
                                             to relations Yi2 = 0, Yi Yj = Yj Yi for |i − j| > 1 and Yi Yi+1 Yi = Yi+1 Yi Yi+1 . The nilCoxeter algebra is the
                                             algebra of divided difference operators (see Macdonald [M], Fomin and Stanley [FS])

                                                                                                             f − si f
                                                                                                   Yi f =             ,                                                    (1)
                                                                                                            xi+1 − xi

                                             where f is a polynomial in x1 , . . . , xn and si f (x1 , . . . , xn ) = f (x1 , . . . , xi+1 , xi , . . . , xn ). Functors FX and
                                             FD are induction and restriction functors associated to the inclusion of algebras An ֒→ An+1 . The following
                                             holds
                                                (d) functors FX and FD , restricted to each Cn , are indecomposable.
                                                It seems likely that ours is the only example (up to obvious modifications of base change, etc.) of an
                                             abelian category C = ⊕ Cn and exact functors FX and FD satisfying conditions (a)-(d) above.
                                                                       n≥0
                                                 In Section 2 we study these and other properties of the category C and functors FX , FD . In Section 3
                                             we equip C with a bialgebra-category structure. Specifically, inclusions of algebras An ⊗ Am ֒→ An+m
                                             give rise to induction and restriction functors, which, when summed over all n, m ≥ 0, become functors
                                             M : C ⊗2 −→ C and ∆ : C → C ⊗2 between C and its second tensor power C ⊗2 . These functors are exact, boast
                                             neat adjointness properties and on the Grothendieck group descend to the multiplication and comultiplication
                                             in the commutative, cocommutative Hopf algebra Q[x] of polynomials in one variable. The associativity
                                             relation for the multiplication, coassociativity of the comultiplication and the consistency relation between
                                             the multiplication and comultiplication become isomorphisms of functors. We check that these isomorphisms
                                             satisfy the coherence relations of Crane and Frenkel [CF] for a bialgebra-category.
                                                 In Section 4.1 we sketch how working with graded modules and bimodules over the nilCoxeter algebra
                                             yields a categorification of the quantum Weyl algebra and of the quantum deformation of the Hopf algebra
                                             H. The grading shift automorphism in the category of graded modules descends to a map of Grothendieck
                                             groups which we interpret as the multiplication by q.
                                                 In Section 4.3 we present a simple generalization of our construction to cross-products and provide a
                                             short comment on the relation of our work to Ariki’s realization [A] of highest weight modules over affine
                                             Lie algebras.

2     The Weyl algebra and bimodules over the nilCoxeter algebra
2.1    The Weyl algebra
The Weyl algebra W is the algebra of differential operators with polynomial coefficients in one variable.
For our purposes define W as the algebra over Z with the unit 1, generators x, ∂ and defining relation
∂x = x∂ + 1. Let RQ be the Q-vector space RQ spanned by x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . . W acts on RQ via x · xi = xi+1
and ∂ · xi = ixi−1 . Abelian subgroups R and R′ of RQ , generated by {xi /i!}∞              i ∞
                                                                                 i=0 and {x }i=0 , respectively,
are W -submodules of RQ , i.e. the action of x and ∂ has integral coefficients in each of these two bases.
   The Weyl algebra has an antiinvolution τ : W → W with

                       τ (x) = ∂,     τ (∂) = x         and        τ (ab) = τ (b)τ (a)      for   a, b ∈ W.   (2)

Let (, ) be the symmetric bilinear form on RQ defined by (xi , xj ) = δi,j i!. This form is τ -invariant:

                                    (ya, b) = (a, τ (y)b) for y ∈ W, a, b ∈ RQ ,                              (3)

and it restricts to an integer valued bilinear product (, ) : R′ × R → Z.

2.2    The nilCoxeter algebra
Let An be the unital algebra over Q generated by Y1 , . . . , Yn−1 with defining relations

                                                  Yi2    =         0

                                              Yi Yj      =         Yj Yi      |i − j| > 1                     (4)

                                         Yi Yi+1 Yi      =         Yi+1 Yi Yi+1 .

Fomin and Stanley [FS] call An the nilCoxeter algebra. It originally appeared in the work of Bernstein,
Gelfand and Gelfand [BGG] on the cohomology of flag varieties and was later investigated and generalized
in various ways by Lascoux and Schützenberger [LS], Macdonald [Mc], Kostant and Kumar [KK], Fomin
and Stanley [FS] and others. Note that if we change the first relation in (4) to Yi2 = 1, we obtain the group
algebra of the symmetric group, which is, indeed, closely related to the nilCoxeter algebra:

Proposition 1 The algebra An is isomorphic to the algebra which is spanned over Q by Yw , as w ranges
over elements of the symmetric group Sn , with the multiplication

                              Yw1 Yw2     =    Yw1 w2         if        l(w1 w2 ) = l(w1 ) + l(w2 ),
                                                                                                              (5)
                              Yw1 Yw2     =    0              otherwise,

where l(w) is the standard length function on the symmetric group, the number of inversions created by w.
The isomorphism is given by sending the generator Yi of An to Ysi where si = (i, i + 1) is the transposition
of i and i + 1.

    In particular, An has dimension n!. Note that A0 = A1 = Q. Introduce a trace map trn : An → Q by

                   trn (Yw0 ) =      1   where w0 is the longest permutation, w0 (i) = n − i,
                                                                                                              (6)
                    trn (Yw ) =      0   if w 6= w0 .



                                                                    2
Proposition 2 The trace map trn is nondegenerate and makes An into a Frobenius algebra.

    P roof: When we say that the trace map is nongenerate we mean that for each y ∈ An , y 6= 0 we can
find y ′ ∈ An such that trn (yy ′ ) = 1. Algebras with a nondegenerate trace map are called Frobenius algebras.
The basic properties of the length function in the symmetric group imply that trn is nondegenerate. 
    For more information about Frobenius algebras we refer the reader to Yamagata [Y] and references
therein.
    Let B1 , B2 be finite-dimensional algebras over a field k and N a finite-dimensional (B1 , B2 )-bimodule.
Then N ∗ = Homk (N, k) is naturally a (B2 , B1 )-bimodule. The duality functor ∗ is a contravariant equiv-
alence between categories of finite-dimensional (B1 , B2 )-bimodules and (B2 , B1 )-bimodules. When B2 = k,
the duality functor ∗ is a contravariant equivalence between categories of left and right B1 -modules.
    If B1 has an automorphism ν, we can use it to twist the left action of B1 on a bimodule N : for y ∈ B1 and
t ∈ N the twisted left action of B1 is ν(y)t. We will denote the resulting bimodule by ν N. An automorphism
ν of B2 allows to twist the right action of B2 on N, we denote the resulting bimodule by Nν .
    Any algebra B is a bimodule over itself in the obvious way. Denote by ψn the involution of An which
takes Yi to Yn−i and by Aψ   n the algebra An as a bimodule over itself with the right action twisted by ψn .
                                                                          ∼
                                                                          =
Let 1ψ n  ∈ Aψ
             n  be the  image  of 1 ∈ An under the isomorphism An −→ Aψ        n of right An -modules, so that
  ψ            ψ
1n Yi = Yn−i 1n .

Proposition 3 An -bimodules A∗n and Aψ
                                     n are isomorphic.

   P roof: For w ∈ Sn let Yw∗ ∈ A∗n be the functional
                                                  (
                                         ∗         1 if σw = w0 ,
                                       Yw (Yσ ) =                                                               (7)
                                                   0 otherwise

It is easy to check that the map A∗n → Aψ           ∗         ψ
                                        n given by Yw 7−→ Yw 1n is a bimodule isomorphism (use that
si w0 = w0 sn−i ). 

Corollary 1 The algebra An is injective as a left and right An -module.

   This follows from either of the last two propositions. 
   Note that the trace trn is quasi-symmetric w.r.t. ψn :

                                     trn (ab) = trn (ψn (b)a)   for   a, b ∈ An .                               (8)

In the terminology of Frobenius algebras, ψn is the Nakayama automorphism associated with trn (see [Y],
Section 2.1).

2.3    Bimodules
Denote by χn the algebra map An → An+1 which sends each Yi to Yi . Proposition 1 implies that χn is
injective. The inclusion χn : An → An+1 induces a left and right An -module structure on An+1 . The left
An module structure on An+1 commutes with the right An+1 -module structure on An+1 , the latter coming
from the right action of An+1 on itself. Thus, An+1 is an (An , An+1 )-bimodule in a natural way, and we
denote this bimodule by Dn+1 . Similary, we get an (An+1 , An )-bimodule structure on An+1 and denote this
bimodule by Xn .

Proposition 4 Bimodules Xn and Dn are left and right projective.

P roof: Bimodule Xn is free of rank 1 as a left An+1 -module and, thus, left projective. As a right An -module,
it is free of rank n + 1 and spanned by 1, Yn , Yn−1 Yn , Yn−2 Yn−1 Yn , . . . , Y1 Y2 . . . Yn (since any element s
of the symmetric group Sn+1 admits a unique decomposition s = si si+1 . . . sn s′ with s′ ∈ Sn and some
i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1). Hence, Xn is projective as a right An -module. The same argument works for Dn . 



                                                         3
Proposition 5 For each n, there is an isomorphism of An -bimodules
                                 Dn+1 ⊗An+1 Xn ∼
                                               = An ⊕ (Xn−1 ⊗An−1 Dn ),                                   (9)
where An is equipped with the standard bimodule structure.
   P roof: The left hand side of (9) is isomorphic to An+1 , considered as an An -bimodule via χn . The right
hand side is the direct sum of An and An ⊗An−1 An . We have maps m1 , m2 of An -bimodules
                              m1 : An → An+1     and       m2 : An ⊗An−1 An → An+1                      (10)
which are uniquely determined by m1 (1) = 1 and m2 (1 ⊗ 1) = Yn . For w ∈ Sn+1 , the element Yw of An+1
lies in m1 (An ) iff w(n + 1) = n + 1. If w(n + 1) 6= n + 1, we can write w = ysn z for y, z ∈ Sn , so that
Yw = m2 (Yy ⊗ Yz ). Therefore, m1 and m2 define an An -bimodule isomorphism
                                                                     ∼
                                                                     =
                                      An ⊕ (An ⊗An−1 An ) −→ An+1 .                                     (11)

             ∞
    Let A = ⊕ An be the direct sum of algebras An over all n. Algebra A does not have a unit, instead it
            n=0
has an infinite system of pairwise orthogonal idempotents 1 ∈ An , n ≥ 0.
   An (An , Ak )-bimodule N is naturally a bimodule over the algebra A. Namely, for x ∈ Ai , i = 6 n we set
xN = 0 and let N x = 0 if x ∈ Ai , i 6= k. In this way, bimodules Xn and Dn , as we sum over all n, give rise
to A-bimodules X = ⊕ Xn and D = ⊕ Dn . We can rephrase Proposition 5 as
                        n≥0           n≥0

Proposition 6 There is a natural isomorphism of A-bimodules
                                        D ⊗A X ∼
                                               = A ⊕ (X ⊗A D).                                          (12)
    This is, of course, a bimodule version of the Weyl algebra relation ∂x = x∂ + 1. The generators x and ∂
of the Weyl algebra become the bimodules X and D, the product in the Weyl algebra becomes the tensor
product of bimodules, addition becomes the direct sum and 1 becomes the identity bimodule A.
    In the rest of this section we continue in the similar fashion, interpreting other structures of the Weyl
algebra and its polynomial representation in the framework of nilCoxeter algebras.

2.4    Categories and functors
                                                                                      ∞
Let Cn be the category of finite-dimensional unital left An -modules, and let C = ⊕ Cn . The category C
                                                                                     n=0
can be viewed as the full subcategory of the category of finite-dimensional left A-modules, which consists of
A-modules N with AN = N and An N = 0 for large enough n.
    An A-bimodule T is called small if it preserves the category C, i.e., for any N ∈ C, the module T ⊗A N is
in C. Denote by FT the functor of tensoring with T. We can reformulate Proposition 6 as saying that there
is a canonical isomorphism of functors
                                             FD FX ∼
                                                   = FX FD ⊕ IdC                                        (13)
   The Grothendieck group K(U) of an abelian category U is the group generated by symbols [N ] for all
objects N of U subject to relations [N2 ] = [N1 ] + [N3 ] whenever there is a short exact sequence 0 → N1 →
N2 → N3 → 0. The Grothendieck group of Cn is isomorphic to Z and generated by [Ln ], where Ln is the
simple An -module (Ln is uniquely defined, up to an isomorphism). We will identify K(Cn ) with the abelian
subgroup of R generated by xn /n!, by sending [Ln ] to xn /n!.
   Since K(C) = ⊕ K(Cn ), the Grothendieck group of C is canonically identified with the abelian group R,
                  n≥0
so that from now on we will consider [N ], for any object N of C, as an element of R. The indecomposable
projective module in Cn (which we denote Pn ) is mapped to xn :
                                                                         xn
                                            [Pn ] = xn ,       [Ln ] =      .                           (14)
                                                                         n!

                                                           4
We interpret the bilinear form (, ) : R′ × R → Z via the Hom bifunctor: if P is a projective object of C and
N is any object, then
                                       dimQ (HomC (P, N )) = ([P ], [N ])                                  (15)
Note that we need P to be projective, otherwise the dimension function on the left hand side will not be
additive in [N ]. Observe also that the form (, ) takes values in Z when restricted to R′ × R, but is fractional
when restricted to R × R.

  Bimodules X and D are right projective, so that the functors of tensoring with them are exact and induce
maps x and ∂ of the Grothendieck group R = K(C):
                         [X ⊗A N ] = x[N ],         [D ⊗A N ] = ∂[N ]   for    N ∈ Ob C.                   (16)
   The functor of tensoring with Xn is the induction functor from An -modules to An+1 -modules, while
tensoring with Dn+1 is the restriction functor from An+1 -modules to An -modules. Since the induction is left
adjoint to the restriction, we conclude that FXn is left adjoint to FDn+1 and FX is left adjoint to FD , i.e.,
there is a bifunctor isomorphism
                                       HomC (FX ?, ?) ∼
                                                      = HomC (?, FD ?).                                    (17)
This isomorphism can be interpreted as the lift of the equality (xa, b) = (a, ∂b) for a, b ∈ RQ , since we just
established that the Hom-bifunctor lifts the bilinear form (, ) (formula (15)).
    Note that (∂a, b) = (a, xb), so that a natural guess says that FX is not only left but also right adjoint to
FD . This is false, but not far from the truth. Consider the bimodule Aψ   n , which was defined in Section 2.2.
Denote by Aψ the A-bimodule which is the direct sum of Aψ      n over all n, and by Ψ : C → C the functor FAψ
of tensoring with Aψ . Since ψn is an involution, Ψ2 ∼= IdC .
Proposition 7 The functor FX is right adjoint to ΨFD Ψ.
   Proof: We use the following
Lemma 1 Let B1 , B2 be Frobenius algebras over a field k and ν1 , ν2 be Nakayama automorphisms of B1 , B2 .
Suppose that N is a finite-dimensional (B1 , B2 )-bimodule which is projective as a left B1 -module and as a
right B2 -module. Then the functor
                                        N ⊗B2 ? : B2 −mod → B1 −mod                                        (18)
of tensoring with N has the right adjoint functor
                                     (N ∗ )ν1 ⊗B1 ? : B1 −mod → B2 −mod                                    (19)
         ∗
(here (N )ν1 is the dual of N, with the right B1 -action twisted by ν1 ) and the left adjoint functor
                                              ∗
                                    ν2−1 (N       )⊗B1 ? : B1 −mod → B2 −mod                               (20)

   In the case when B1 and B2 are symmetric algebras (i.e. ν1 , ν2 are identity maps), rather than just
Frobenius algebras, this lemma is proved in Rickard [R], Corollary 9.2.4. The same proof works for Frobenius
algebras. 
   Applying this lemma to the (An+1 , An )-bimodule Xn proves the proposition (the Nakayama automor-
phism of An is ψn , hence the conjugation by Ψ in the second adjointness isomorphism). 

    The algebra W has a Q-vector space basis {xm ∂ n } for n, m ≥ 0. We will call this basis the canonical
basis of W. A product of two elements of the canonical basis decomposes as a linear combination of canonical
basis vectors with nonnegative integral coefficients. This basis can be interpreted in terms of indecomposable
bimodules. Namely, the (A, A)-bimodule X ⊗m ⊗ D⊗n (all tensor products are over A), which in our theory
is naturally associated to xm ∂ n , is the direct sum of (Am+k−n , Ak )-bimodules Am+k−n ⊗Ak−n Ak , over all
k ≥ n, and we have
Proposition 8 The (Am+k−n , Ak )-bimodule Am+k−n ⊗Ak−n Ak is indecomposable.
   Proof: An exercise. 

                                                           5
2.5    Contravariant duality
Denote by Cnr the category of finite-dimensional right An -modules and by C r the direct sum of categories Cnr
over all n ≥ 0. The duality functor N ∗ = Hom(N, k), defined in Section 2.2 for bimodules, will be considered
in this section as a contravariant functor from C to C r .
    Let u be the antiinvolution of An which takes Yi to Yi . It induces an equivalence of categories of left and
right An -modules. As we sum over all n, we obtain an equivalence of categories U : C r → C.
    The functor Ω = U ∗ is a contravariant equivalence C → C.

Proposition 9 There are natural isomorphisms of functors

                                                 Ω2       ∼
                                                          =       IdC                                      (21)
                                                 ΩΨ       ∼
                                                          =       ΨΩ                                       (22)
                                             ΩΨFX         ∼
                                                          =       FX ΩΨ                                    (23)
                                               ΩFD        ∼
                                                          =       FD Ω                                     (24)

   Proof Ω2 ∼= IdC , since u is an antiinvolution, and ΩΨ ∼
                                                          = ΨΩ, since uψn = ψn u. Isomorphism (23) is a
corollary of

Lemma 2        1. There is an isomorphism of bimodules

                                              Xn∗ ∼             ψ
                                                  = Dn+1 ⊗An+1 An+1                                        (25)

  2. There are isomorphisms, functorial in N ∈ Cn ,

                                        (Aψ         ∗         ∼    N ∗ ⊗An Aψ
                                          n ⊗ An N )          =              n                             (26)
                                        (Xn ⊗An N )   ∗       ∼
                                                              =             e n+1 ,
                                                                   N ∗ ⊗ An D                              (27)
            e n+1 is the (An , An+1 )-bimodule Aψ ⊗An Dn+1 ⊗An+1 Aψ .
      where D                                   n                 n+1

  3. There are functorial in N ∈ Cnr isomorphisms

                      U (N ⊗An Dn+1 ) ∼
                                      = Xn ⊗An U (N ),              U (N ⊗An Aψ   ∼ ψ
                                                                              n ) = An ⊗An U (N ).         (28)

    Statement 1 of the lemma follows from Proposition 3. Let us now prove (27). If N = Pn , the inde-
composable projective An -module, the isomorphism (27) follows from (25). Moreover, (25) also implies that
(27) is functorial relative to An -module maps Pn → Pn (here N = Pn ). For an arbitrary N, represent N as
the cokernel of a map of projective modules: Pn⊕a → Pn⊕b → N → 0. Applying the functors on the left and
right hand sides of (27) to each term of this exact sequence, and using the exactness of tensoring with Xn
and De n+1 , we conclude that (27) holds for any N, functorially in N. Other statements of the lemma can be
proved in a similar or easier fashion. 
    Armed with Lemma 2, we compute, for N ∈ C,
                                                  e = Ψ2 X ⊗ (ΨU (N ∗ )) = FX ΨΩ(N ).
               ΩΨFX (N ) = ΨΩ(X ⊗ N ) = ΨU (N ∗ ⊗ D)                                                       (29)

   Isomorphism (24) is adjoint to (23). 

2.6    The integral
We can next ask about the meaning of the indefinite integral in our model. The formula
                                            Z
                                                      xn+1
                                               xn =                                                        (30)
                                                      n+1
suggests to look for an exact functor from Cn to Cn+1 which takes the projective module Pn to a module
which is n + 1 times “smaller” than the projective module Pn+1 (since in our correspondence the image of
the projective module Pi in the ring of polynomials is xi ). Let In be the (An+1 , An )-bimodule, which is

                                                          6
isomorphic to An as the right An -module, and the left An+1 -action is via the homomorphism of algebras
tn+1 : An+1 → An , tn+1 (Yi ) = Yi for i < n and tn+1 (Yn ) = 0. Since In is projective as a right An -module, the
functor FIn : Cn → Cn+1 of tensoring an An -module with In is exact. Moreover, FIn takes the indecomposable
projective module Pn to a module of dimension n!, while theRprojective generator Pn+1 of Cn+1 has dimension
(n + 1)!, so that the desired relation holds: [In ⊗An N ] = [N ] for N ∈ Ob(Cn ). To formulate this relation
                                       ∞
without the index n, we form I = ⊕ In , the A-bimodule which is the direct sum of In over all n. Then we
                                    n=0
have
                                                   Z
                                    [I ⊗A N ] =        [N ]       for all   N ∈ ObC.                          (31)

    The following result is obvious:
Proposition 10 There are bimodule isomorphisms Dn+1 ⊗An+1 In ∼       = An and D ⊗A I ∼= A.
                                                                           R
This isomorphism can be considered as a categorification of the formula dR f (x) = f (x), for a polynomial
function f (x). On the other hand, we don’t get to categorify the formula df (x) = f (x), for I ⊗A D is not
isomorphic to A as an A-bimodule.

2.7     Multiplication and the Leibniz rule
Let γn,m be the algebra homomorphism An ⊗ Am → An+m given by

                                  γn,m (Yi ⊗ 1) = Yi ,            γn,m (1 ⊗ Yi ) = Yn+i .                     (32)

γn,m is injective and induces a bifunctor, denoted Jn,m , from the product Cn × Cm of categories Cn and Cm
to Cn+m :

                   Jn,m (N1 , N2 ) = An+m ⊗(An ⊗Am ) (N1 ⊗ N2 )              for    N 1 ∈ Cn , N 2 ∈ Cm .     (33)

Denote by J the bifunctor C × C → C, which is the direct sum of Jn,m over all n, m ≥ 0.

Proposition 11        1. Bifunctor J is biexact.
    2. There is a functorial isomorphism FD ◦J(N1 , N2 ) ∼
                                                         = J(N1 , FD N2 )⊕J(FD N1 , N2 ), satisfying the natural
       consistency relation for the decomposition of FD ◦ J(J(N1 , N2 ), N3 ).

We omit the proof. 
   Since J is biexact, it induces a map of Grothendieck groups K(C) × K(C) → K(C), which is just the
multiplication in the ring of polynomials. Part 2 of the proposition is a functor version of the Leibniz rule
∂(ab) = (∂a)b + a(∂b).


3      The bialgebra-category structure of C
3.1     Multiplication and comultiplication
The algebra of polynomials RQ = Q[x] has a comultiplication c(x) = x ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ x which makes RQ into a
bialgebra. The subring R of RQ is stable under the comultiplication and has a structure of a bialgebra over
Z. We will explains in detail how to lift the bialgebra structure from R to the category C.
    Let n = (n1 , . . . , ni ) be an ordered i-tuple of nonnegative integers. Let An = An1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Ani and denote
by Cn the category of finite dimensional left An -modules. Let C ⊗i the direct sum of categories Cn over all
i-tuples n.
    Algebra homomorphisms γn,m : An ⊗ Am → An+m , summed over all n and m, define induction and
restriction functors:

                                           M : C ⊗2 → C,           ∆ : C → C ⊗2 .                             (34)


                                                              7
    Note that the Grothendieck group of C ⊗i is naturally isomorphic to the i-th tensor power of K(C). The
symmetric group Si acts on the set of i-tuples by permutations of terms. This action induces an action of
Si on the category C ⊗i . We denote by Sj,j+1 the action of the transposition (j, j + 1).
    If a functor Gk : C ⊗ik → C ⊗jk , k = 1, 2 is given by tensoring with a bimodule Wk , denote by G1 ⊗ G2 the
functor C ⊗(i1 +i2 ) → C ⊗(j1 +j2 ) of tensoring with the bimodule W1 ⊗Q W2 .

Proposition 12        1. M is left adjoint to ∆ and right adjoint to S12 ∆.
  2. There are functor isomorphisms

                                                 M S12  ∼
                                                        =        ΨM Ψ⊗2                                       (35)
                                                        ∼
                                                  S12 ∆ =        Ψ   ⊗2
                                                                          ∆Ψ                                  (36)

  3. Functors M and ∆ are exact and on the Grothendieck group descend to the multiplication and comul-
     tiplication in the bialgebra K(C).

   Proof Part 2 of the proposition follows from an obvious computation with bimodules. Next, M is
induction and ∆ is restriction, thus, M is left adjoint to ∆. An+m is projective as left or right An ⊗ Am -
module, so we can apply Lemma 1 and conclude that M is right adjoint to Ψ⊗2 ∆Ψ. Together with the
isomorphism (36), this implies that M is right adjoint to S12 ∆. Since M and ∆ each have left and right
adjoints, they are exact. 

Proposition 13        1. There are functor isomorphisms

    Proof Functors M (M ⊗ Id) and M (Id ⊗ M ), restricted to Cn ⊗ Cm ⊗ Ck , are canonically isomorphic to the
functor of tensoring with An+m+k , considered as a left An+m+k -module and a right An ⊗ Am ⊗ Ak -module.
Hence the functor isomorphism (37). The same argument works for (38). To prove (39), note that both
sides of it decompose as direct sums of functors Cn ⊗ Cm → Ck ⊗ Cl , over all quadruples (n, m, k, l) such
that n + m = k + l. The left hand side of (39), as a functor Cn ⊗ Cm → Ck ⊗ Cl , is naturally isomorphic to
the functor of tensoring with An+m , considered as a left Ak ⊗ Al and a right An ⊗ Am -module, via algebra
homomorphisms γk,l and γn,m .

Lemma 3 Let w1 , . . . , wp , where p = min(n, m, k, l), be minimal length representatives of double cosets
Sk × Sl \ Sk+l /Sn × Sm . Then An+m is isomorphic, as an (Ak ⊗ Al , An ⊗ Am )-bimodule, to the direct sum
of subbimodules of An+m , spanned by Yw1 , . . . , Ywp .

    We omit the proof of the lemma. 
    The right hand side of (39), as a functor Cn ⊗ Cm → Ck ⊗ Cl , is isomorphic to the direct sum (over
all admissible r) of the following functors: restrict from An ⊗ Am to Ar ⊗ An−r ⊗ Ak−r ⊗ Al+r−n and
then induce to Ak ⊗ Al . Denote the corresponding (Ak ⊗ Al , An ⊗ Am )-bimodule by Br , it has a canonical
generator that we will call gr . To r there is associated a minimal length representative, w(r), of the double
cosets Sk × Sl \ Sk+l /Sn × Sm . Namely, w(r) is the permutation that preserves the first r elements of the
set {1, 2, . . . , n + m}, shifts the next n − r elements by k − r to the right, shift the following k − r elements
by n − r to the left and preserves the last l + r − n elements. Sending the generator gr of this bimodule
to Yw(r) ∈ An+m and summing over all admissible r gives us an isomorphism of bimodules ⊕Br ∼              = An+m .
                                                                                                   r
Finally, summing over all (n, m, k, l) with n + m = k + l, we get a functor isomorphism (39).

3.2    Coherence relations
Bialgebra-categories first appeared in the work of Crane and Frenkel [CF]. Crane and Frenkel argued that,
while Hopf algebras produce invariants of 3-manifolds, quantum invariants of 4-manifolds will be governed by
Hopf categories. In Hopf categories multiplication and comultiplication operations become functors, functor
isomorphisms take place of (co)associativity of (co)multiplication and of the consistency relation between
multiplication and comultiplication. Crane and Frenkel imposed 4 coherence relations on these functor
isomorphisms. These relations pop up in our simple example:

Proposition 14 Isomorphisms (37), (38) and (39) satisfy the coherence relations of Crane and Frenkel for
bialgebra-categories.

   The coherence relation for the multiplication can be viewed as a cube, depicted in Figure 1.

    In the vertices of the cube we have placed categories, arrows are functors and 6 square facets of the cube
are functor isomorphisms. For simplicity we write 1 for the identity functor Id. Any path leading from C ⊗4
to C defines a functor, and any square facet defines an isomorphism of functors. Starting with the functor
corresponding to a path, we can apply all 6 isomorphisms and return to the functor we started with. The
coherence relation requires this natural transformation of functors to be the identity. This relation is obvious
in our case. Note that the coherence relation for the multiplication is just the coherence relation for the
tensor product functor in the monoidal categories, also known as the pentagon associativity (see Mac Lane
[M], for instance).
    The coherence relation for the comultiplication is obtained from Figure 1 by reversing all arrows and
changing all appearances of M into ∆, This coherence holds in our category for obvious reasons too. More-
over, if we start from the multiplication coherence relation and change all functors and functor isomorphisms
to their right adjoints, we get the coherence relation for the comultiplication. Or, if we start from the mul-
tiplication coherence relation and pass to left adjoints, we again get the comultiplication coherence relation
(after canceling out all appearances of permutations in left adjoints, since the left adjoint of M is S12 ∆).
    There are two coherence relations that contain both multiplication and comultiplication. One of them
is depicted in Figure 2. To get the other one, change Figure 2 in the following way: exchange M with
∆ everywhere, reverse the direction of all arrows and invert the order of all compositions of functors, i.e.,
M 2 ◦ S23 should become S23 ◦ ∆2 .

    In our category C functors M and ∆ have nice adjointness properties, and these two coherence relations
are equivalent via adjointness. Figure 2 coherence cube in the category C follows from a simple computation
with double cosets Sk × Sl \ Sn+m+p /Sn × Sm × Sp for k + l = n + m + p. We omit the details. 

3.3    Other structures
Commutativity and cocommutativity: The bialgebra R is commutative and cocommutative. The
bialgebra-category C is not commutative or cocommutative, in the sense that M S12 is not isomorphic to M
and S12 ∆ is not isomorphic to ∆. Instead, we have isomorphisms (35) and (36), which say that M S12 , resp.
S12 ∆ is isomorphic to M, resp. ∆, twisted by the involution functor Ψ. We will refer to these properties of M
and ∆ as quasi-commutativity and quasi-cocommutativity, respectively. What are the coherence relations for
quasi-commutativity and quasi-cocommutativity? First of all, the usual coherence cube for the associativity
and commutativity constraints in symmetric monoidal categories can be twisted by Ψ into the one, depicted
in Figure 3 (where Ψ2 denotes Ψ⊗2 , etc.)

   To obtain the coherence relation between the quasi-cocommutativity and coassociativity isomorphisms,
change the direction of all arrows in Figure 3, substitute ∆ for M and invert the order of all compositions.
Finally, the Figure 4 below shows a coherence cube for the “mixed” quasi-(co)commutativity.

Proposition 15 These 3 coherence relations hold in the category C.

    Unit and counit: Let Q-vect be the category of finite-dimensional Q-vector spaces. The functor
ι : Q-vect → C which takes a vector space V to itself, considered as a module over A0 = Q, plays the role of
the unit in the bialgebra-category C. The functor ǫ : C → Q-vect which takes Cn to 0 for n > 0 and V ∈ C0
to V ∈ Q-vect is the counit functor.

    Antipode: So far we referred to C as a bialgebra-category, rather than a Hopf category, and did not
say a word about the antipode. The antipode s in the Hopf algebra R is given by s(x) = −x. Clearly, the
antipode cannot be lifted to any exact functor in C, since it does not have positive coefficients in the basis
of simple modules. This negativity is not a serious obstacle, though. We can pass to the bounded derived
category Db (C) of C, derive the functors M and ∆ and define the antipode functor T : Db (C) → Db (C) as
the composition of a shift by [n] (for Cn ) in the derived category and Ψ,

                                      T (N ) = ΨN [n], for N ∈ Db (Cn ).                                  (40)

On the Grothendieck group level Ψ does nothing, but it enables us to lift the identity s(ab) = s(b)s(a)
to the isomorphism of functors T M ∼
                                   = M T ⊗2S12 . But we are in for a bigger trouble: there is no functor
isomorphism

                                               M (T ⊗ Id)∆ ∼
                                                           = ιǫ,                                          (41)

which any self-respecting Hopf category must have. No easy way to save the day by modifying the antipode
functor is in sight. The problem lies with our childish definition of tensor powers of C, as the direct sum
of many little blocks. One conjectural remedy would be to glue these little pieces into a more sophisticated
construct, which should retain all the nice bialgebra-category properties of C and should also have an antipode
functor with the isomorphism (41) and coherence relations for it.

4.1    Graded bimodules and a categorification of the quantum Weyl algebra
The algebra An is graded, with each Yi in degree 1, and the Poincare polynomial of An is [n]! where
[n]! = [1] . . . [n] and [i] = 1 + q + · · · + q i−1 . Let C n be the category of finite-dimensional graded left An -
modules and C = ⊕ C n . Let {i} be the functor of shifting the grading up by i. Bimodules X and D over A
                   n≥0
are graded, tensoring with these bimodules over A give us functors, denoted F X , F D , in the category C.
Proposition 16 There is a functor isomorphism
                                            F DF X ∼
                                                   = F X F D {1} ⊕ Id                                           (42)
    We define the quantum Weyl algebra as the algebra over Z[q, q −1 ], generated by x and ∂, with relation
                                                                                                   xn
∂x = qx∂ + 1. Let R be the module over the quantum Weyl algebra, spanned over Z[q, q −1 ] by [n]!     , with the
action x · xi = xi+1 , ∂xi = [i]xi−1 .
    The Grothendieck group K(C) of C is a free Z[q, q −1 ]-module, spanned by the images of simple modules
Ln . The Z[q, q −1 ]-module structure comes from the grading, [N {i}] = q i [N ], for a graded module N. Thus,
                                                        xn
                                             [Ln ] =        ,    [Pn ] = xn .                                   (43)
                                                       [n]!
As a result, K(C) can be naturally identified with R. All other structures described in Section 2 have their
graded versions. We skip the details.
    The product M : C ⊗2 → C is again defined as the induction functor, while the coproduct ∆, considered
as a functor from C n to ⊕ C k ⊗ C n−k , is the restriction from An to Ak ⊗ An−k , composed with the shift
                          0≤k≤n
in the grading up by n − k. On the Grothendieck group, the coproduct functor acts as the comultiplication
∆(x) = x ⊗ 1 + q ⊗ x. Functor isomorphisms of Proposition 13 hold in the graded case as well and all results
of Section 3 generalize easily to the graded case.

4.2    Representations of symmetric groups
The bialgebra-category C is reminiscent of a similar structure for symmetric groups, discovered by Geissinger
[G], who observed that induction and restriction functors associated to inclusions of symmetric groups
Sn × Sm ֒→ Sn+m induce a bialgebra structure on the direct sum of Grothendieck groups of the categories
of Sn -modules, over all n. Geissinger [G] and Zelevinsky [Z] consistently derived many classical results on
representations of symmetric groups from this Hopf algebra structure. Zelevinsky also generalized this
construction from symmetric groups to wreath products of symmetric groups with finite groups and to
GL(n, F), for a finite field F. Although Gessinger and Zelevinsky work mostly with Grothendieck groups, their
results can be immediately reformulated in terms of categories. In particular, induction and restriction define
a bialgebra-category structure on the category ⊕ k[Sn ]-mod, where k is a field and k[Sn ]-mod the category
                                                   n≥0
of finite-dimensional modules over the group algebra of Sn . There are several other interesting examples of
bialgebra-categories that naturally appear in representation theory. We will discuss them elsewhere.

4.3    Nil wreath products
Let B be an algebra over Q. By An (B) we denote the semidirect product of An and B ⊗n , with the multipli-
cation Yw b1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ bn = bw(1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ bw(n) Yw for w ∈ Sn and bi ∈ B.
Proposition 17 If B is a Frobenius algebra then An (B) is also Frobenius.
  If B = Q[z]/{z k = 0}, denote An (B) by An (k). Let Cn (k) be the category of finite dimensional An (k)-
modules and C(k) = ⊕ Cn (k). Inclusions An (k) ֒→ An+1 (k) induce induction and restriction functors
                         n≥0
between categories Cn (k) and Cn+1 (k). Denote by FX,k , resp. FD,k , the direct sum of these induction, resp.
restriction functors over all n.

                                                            12
Proposition 18 There is a functor isomorphism FD,k FX,k ∼
                                                        = FX,k FD,k ⊕ (Id⊕k ).

Various constructions and results of previous sections, including adjointness isomorphisms and bialgebra-
category structures, can be generalized to algebras An (k). These algebras are nilpotent counterparts of
the wreath products of symmetric groups with cyclic groups and of Ariki-Koike cyclotomic Hecke algebras
[AK]. For instance, the nilCoxeter and Hecke algebras belong to a two-parameter family of algebras with
generators T1 , . . . Tn−1 and relations Ti2 = aTi + b, Ti Tj = Tj Ti for |i − j| > 1 and Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1
(specializing a = b = 0, resp. a = 1 − q, b = q, gets us the nilCoxeter algebra, resp. the Hecke algebra).
From this point of view, our categorification of the Weyl algebra action on polynomials is a toy degeneration
of Ariki’s magnificent realization [A] of irreducible highest weight modules over the affine Lie algebra sl  b n as
Grothendieck groups of categories of modules over cyclotomic Hecke algebras.
