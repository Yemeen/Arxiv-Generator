                                                   Abstract. We give explicit presentations by generators and rela-
                                                   tions of certain generalized Schur algebras (associated with tensor
                                                   powers of the natural representation) in types B, C, D. This ex-
                                                   tends previous results in type A obtained by two of the authors.
                                                   The presentation is compatible with the Serre presentation of the
                                                   corresponding universal enveloping algebra. In types C, D this
                                                   gives a presentation of the corresponding classical Schur algebra
                                                   (the image of the representation on a tensor power) since the clas-
                                                   sical Schur algebra coincides with the generalized Schur algebra in
                                                   those types. This coincidence between the generalized and classical
                                                   Schur algebra fails in type B, in general.




                                                                          Introduction
                                               Throughout the paper we work over Q. Vector spaces are over Q
                                            unless we say otherwise. In fact, all the results are valid over any field
                                            of characteristic zero.
                                               In [D] a new presentation of a generalized Schur algebra was given.
                                            This presentation is compatible with Lusztig’s modified form U̇ of the
                                            universal enveloping algebra U, in which the Cartan generators are re-
                                            placed by a system of orthogonal idempotents corresponding to weight
                                            space projectors. We are interested in the generalized Schur algebras
                                            S(π) associated to the set π = π(r) of dominant weights in a given ten-
                                            sor power E⊗r of the natural representation E of a simple Lie algebra of
                                            type B, C, or D. Our main result is a presentation by generators and
                                            relations of S(π) which is directly compatible with Serre’s presentation
                                            of U; i.e., the generators of the zero part are Cartan generators instead
                                            of idempotents. These results are formulated in Section 2 and proved

in Section 3; they extend results of [DG2, DG1] for type A to the other
classical types.
   We are also interested in the classical Schur algebras S(r), which we
define to be the image of the representation U → End(E⊗r ). These
algebras are closely linked to classical invariant theory, and interest
in them goes back to Schur and Weyl. They are in types B–D the
commuting algebras for the action on tensors of an appropriate Brauer
algebra; see [B]. (In type A the classical Schur algebras are the com-
muting algebras for the natural action of symmetric groups, acting by
place permutation.) As explained in [D, §7.4], the classical Schur alge-
bra coincides with the corresponding generalized Schur algebra S(π) if
and only if the set π0 of highest weights labeling composition factors
of E⊗r coincides with the set π of dominant weights occurring in E⊗r .
The inclusion π0 ⊂ π is obvious. In types A, C, and D it turns out
that this inclusion is equality; in type B this is not so — see 1.3.3 and
1.3.4. Thus the Schur algebra S(r) coincides with the generalized Schur
algebra S(π) in types A, C, and D, but in type B the Schur algebra
S(r) is in general a proper quotient of S(π).
   We rely on Weyl for the computation of the set π0 of highest weights
labeling composition factors of tensor powers of E. In order to make
this exposition somewhat self-contained, we collect the relevant results
from Weyl’s book in an appendix.
   Although we work in characteristic zero throughout the paper, it
should be noted that the Schur algebras and generalized Schur algebras
considered herein are defined over Z, so their study can be undertaken
in any characteristic.
   Another interesting problem is to find a basis of S(π) which is in
some sense compatible with a Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt basis of U. As
an application of Littelmann’s path model, we describe such a basis in
Section 4.

                 1. Generalized Schur algebras
  Let g be a reductive Lie algebra. The theory of generalized Schur
algebras was introduced by Donkin in [Do1, Do2, Do4]. A generalized
Schur algebra is a certain quotient of U = U(g) obtained by throwing
away all but finitely many simple modules. More precisely, let π be a
saturated set of dominant weights, meaning that if λ ∈ π and if µ is a
dominant weight such that µ 6 λ (in the usual dominance order), then
µ ∈ π. The generalized Schur algebra determined by π is the algebra
S(π) := U(g)/I, where I is the ideal of U(g) consisting of all elements
                 PRESENTING GENERALIZED SCHUR ALGEBRAS                          3

of U(g) annihilating every simple U-module of highest weight belonging
to π.
   In this paper, we take g to be a simple Lie algebra of classical type Bn ,
Cn , or Dn and we always take π equal to the set Π+ (E⊗r ) of dominant
weights of E⊗r , where E is the natural representation of g. Donkin
[Do2, Do3] showed that, in types A and C, the generalized Schur algebra
S(π) determined by this choice of π coincides with the Schur algebra
S(r). We extend this to type D; see Proposition 1.3.3 ahead. The
corresponding result is not generally true in type B.

1.1. Basic notation. In types Bn , Cn , Dn let g be defined by the form
given by
                       
                 0 I 0                            
               I 0 0 ;         0    I        0   I
                                          ;            .
                                −I 0           I 0
                 0 0 1
where I is the n × n identity matrix.
   Let m = dim E. Set ei,j = (δik δlj )16k,l6m. The set {ei,j | 1 6 i, j 6
m} is a basis of glm . In type An−1 we have m = n. The Hi := ei,i
(1 6 i 6 n) form a basis for the diagonal Cartan subalgebra h of gln In
types Bn , Cn , Dn we have respectively m = 2n + 1, 2n, 2n and we set
Hi = ei,i − en+i,n+i (1 6 i 6 n); the Hi form a basis for the diagonal
Cartan subalgebra h of so2n+1 , sp2n , so2n respectively.
   In all types A–D, let {εj } be the basis of h∗ dual to the basis {Hi }
of h; so that εj (Hi ) = δij . Define a bilinear form ( , ) on h∗ such that
(εi , εj ) = δij .
   Denote by α1 , . . . , αn a fixed choice of simple roots in types Bn , Cn , Dn .
Let (aij ) be the Cartan matrix, defined by aij = 2(αi , αj )/(αi , αi ).

1.2. Weights. We regard weights as n-tuples of rational numbers, de-
termining linear functionals on h by recording their values on the ba-
sis H1 , . . . , Hn . In other words, we identify the linear combination
λ1 ε1 + · · · + λn εn with the tuple λ = (λ1 , . . . , λn ).
   Fix simple root vectors ei ∈ gαi , fi ∈ g−αi . The fundamental weights
̟j (1 6 j 6 n) are the elements of h∗ defined by ̟j (hi ) = δij , where
hi := [ei , fi ]. The lattice of integral weights is the free abelian group
X generated
      P           by the ̟i , and the set X + of dominant weights is the
cone      N̟i . One checks that X is generated by ε1 , . . . , εn in type Cn
and by ε1 , . . . , εn together with the element (ε1 + · · · + εn )/2 in types
Bn , Dn . As usual, the dominance (partial) order on X is defined by
declaring that λ 6 µ (for λ, µ ∈ X) if µ − λ ∈ Nα1 + · · · + Nαn .
4                      DOTY, GIAQUINTO, AND SULLIVAN

  We identify h∗ with Qn by regarding ε1 , . . . , εn as the standard basis
of Qn ; this identifies X with a subgroup of Qn . In fact, under this
identification, we have
                      (
                        Zn                           (type Cn );
(1.2.1)         X=       n     1           1      n
                        Z ∪ (( 2 , . . . , 2 ) + Z ) (types Bn , Dn ).

The fundamental weights in type Cn are given explicitly by the equal-
ities
(1.2.2)               ̟ i = ε1 + · · · + εi     (1 6 i 6 n).
In type Bn the fundamental weights are given by
(1.2.3) ̟i = ε1 + · · · + εi   (1 6 i 6 n − 1),         ̟n = (ε1 + · · · + εn )/2
and in type Dn by
                        ̟ i = ε1 + · · · + εi    (1 6 i 6 n − 2),
(1.2.4)
            ̟n−1 = (ε1 + · · · + εn−1 − εn )/2,      ̟n = (ε1 + · · · + εn )/2.
The set X + of dominant weights is the set of all λ = (λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ X
satisfying
                     λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λn > 0         (types Bn , Cn );
(1.2.5)
                  λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λn−1 > |λn | (type Dn ).

1.3. Signed compositions. We shall need the following notations.
Write
            Λ(n, r) = {(λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ Nn | λi = r};
                                                 P

            Λ(n, r) = {(λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ Zn |
                                                 P
                                                   |λi | = r}.
The first set is the set of n-part compositions of r and the second is the
set of n-part signed compositions of r. Note that we allow 0 to appear
in a composition. Set
    Λ+ (n, r) = {(λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ Nn | λi = r, λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λn }.
                                          P

As usual, we identify members of Λ+ (n, r) with partitions of not more
than n parts. Given λ ∈ Λ+ (n, r), set λ− := (λ1 , . . . , λn−1 , −λn ) (its
associated weight), and let
    Λ− (n, r) = {λ− | λ ∈ Λ+ (n, r)},         Λ± (n, r) = Λ− (n, r) ∪ Λ+ (n, r).
Label the finite-dimensional simple g-modules L by their highest weight
λ ∈ X + (regarded as a vector of h-eigenvalues on H1 , . . . , Hn ).

Proposition 1.3.1. (a) The set of weights Π of E⊗r is the set of all
signed n-part compositions of r − 2j for 0 6 j 6 [r/2] (i.e. the union
of the Λ(n, r − 2j) for 0 6 j 6 [r/2]) in types Cn , Dn and the set of
all signed n-part compositions of r − j for 0 6 j 6 r (i.e. the union of
the Λ(n, r − j) for 0 6 j 6 r) in type Bn .
   (b) The set Π+ of dominant weights of E⊗r is the union over 0 6
j 6 [r/2] of the sets Λ+ (n, r − 2j) in type Cn , the union over 0 6 j 6 r
of the sets Λ+ (n, r − j) in type Bn , and the union over 0 6 j 6 [r/2]
of the sets Λ± (n, r − 2j) in type Dn .
Proof. In types Cn , Dn the weights of E are {±ε1 , . . . , ±εn }. In type
Bn the weights of E are {±ε1 , . . . , ±εn } ∪ {0}. The weights of E⊗r are
given by all expressions of the form
                             w1 + · · · + wr
where wi is a weight of E for each i. (The wi are not necessarily
distinct.) Part (a) is now clear.
  To prove part (b), combine part (a) with (1.2.5).            
Proposition 1.3.2. The set π = Π+ (E⊗r ) of dominant weights in E⊗r
is a saturated subset of X + , for types Bn , Cn , Dn .
Proof. One can decompose E⊗r into a direct sum of irreducible modules.
The set of dominant weights of an irreducible is necessarily saturated
(in characteristic zero), and the union of saturated sets is necessarily
saturated. In, fact, this argument shows that the set of dominant
weights of any g-module must be a saturated set.                      
  We remark that one can also give a combinatorial proof of the pre-
ceding result.
Proposition 1.3.3. The Schur algebras S(r) in types Cn , Dn are gen-
eralized Schur algebras determined by the saturated set π = Π+ (E⊗r ).
Proof. S(r) is by definition the image of the representation U → End(E⊗r ),
so S(r) ≃ U/A where A is the annihilator of E⊗r . By Wedderburn the-
ory, the simple S(r)-modules are the direct summands of E⊗r , and thus
must have highest weight belonging to the set π = Π+ (E⊗r ).
  Let S(π) = U/I be Donkin’s generalized Schur algebra determined
by the saturated set π. Here I is the ideal of U consisting of the ele-
ments annihilating every simple U-module of highest weight belonging
to π. Clearly A ⊆ I.
  Let π0 be the set of highest weights of composition factors appearing
as a direct summand in a Wedderburn decomposition of E⊗r . Weyl
6                    DOTY, GIAQUINTO, AND SULLIVAN

computed the decomposition of tensor space for the special orthogonal
and symplectic groups. His results show that, in types Cn and Dn ,
π0 = π. (See the appendix for a detailed summary of Weyl’s results,
with references.) This justifiess the equlity A = I, in types C, D. The
proof is complete.                                                   

Remark 1.3.4. The preceding result often fails for type Bn . Indeed,
the natural module E has two dominant weights but only one highest
weight, so for any n the needed equlity π0 = π fails already for r = 1.
Moreover, in type B2 = so5 we have π0 = {(2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0)} but the
set π is {(2, 0), (1, 1), (1.0), (0, 0)}. Here we relied on Weyl’s Theorem
A.3 in the appendix for a description of π0 in type B, and Proposition
1.3.1 above for the set π.
  Interestingly, the desired equality π0 = π holds when n = 1 and
r > 2. It would be useful to classifiy those pairs n and r for which
π0 = π for type Bn .                                                     ⋄

1.4. The idempotent presentation. Let π = Π+ (E⊗r ), in types B,
C, and D. In [D, 6.13], it was shown that the generalized Schur algebra
S(π) is isomorphic with the associative algebra (with 1) on generators
ei , fi (1 6 i 6 n), 1λ (λ ∈ W π) with the relations

                                      2. Main results

  In the statements to follow, notice that the first, third, fourth, fifth,
and sixth relations are identical in all types. In other words, only the
second and seventh relations vary by type. (The seventh relation is the
same in types C, D.)

  The enveloping algebra U(so2n ) is the algebra on the same genera-
tors but subject only to the relations (D1)–(D5); that presentation of
U(so2n ) is equivalent to the usual Serre presentation.
  The relation (D6) is superfluous.

   The proof of all three theorems of this section is given in the next
section. Our strategy is to show that the presentation of the theorem
is equivalent to the idempotent presentation of section 1.4.
Remark 2.3.8. One can easily show that any Hi , viewed as an operator
on E⊗r , satisfies its minimal polynomial P1 (T ), and similarly that any
J, viewed as an operator on E⊗r , satisfies its minimal polynomial P1 (T ),
in type B, or P2 (T ), in types C, D.                                    ⋄

                 3. Proof of the main theorems
  We will show that the generalized Schur algebra S(π), with π =
 +
Π (E⊗r ), defined by the presentation in 1.4 is isomorphic with the
algebra given by the generators and relations of Theorems 2.1.1, 2.2.1,
or 2.3.1, in types Bn –Dn .

3.1. The algebra Φ. Write U = U(g). Given a positive integer r, set
              P1 (T ) = (T + r)(T + r − 1) · · · (T − r + 1)(T − r),
(3.1.1)
              P2 (T ) = (T + r)(T + r − 2) · · · (T − r + 2)(T − r)
polynomials of degree 2r + 1, r + 1, respectively. Let Φ be the algebra
given by the generators and relations of Theorem 2.1.1, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
Then Φ = U/I. In types Cn and Dn , I is the two-sided ideal of U
generated by the P1 (Hi ) (i = 1, . . . , n) and P2 (J) for all J = ±H1 ±
· · · ± Hn . In type Bn , I is the two-sided ideal of U generated by the
P1 (Hi ) (i = 1, . . . , n) and P1 (J) for all J.

   From the triangular decomposition U = U− U0 U+ of U we have a cor-
responding triangular decomposition Φ = Φ− Φ0 Φ+ , where each algebra
Φ− , Φ0 , Φ+ is defined to be the image under the appropriate surjective
map of the corresponding subalgebra of U. Let UZ be Kostant’s Z-form
of U relative to the Chevalley generators ei , fi ; this is the Z-subalgebra
                          (a)   (c)
of U generated by all fi , ei (a, c ∈ N, 1 6 i 6 n). Then we have
                      0 +           − 0 +
equalities UZ = U− Z UZ UZ , ΦZ = ΦZ ΦZ ΦZ where the various subalgebras
are defined in the obvious manner.
   For the moment, regard H1 , . . . , Hn as commuting indeterminates.
A given set of polynomials in the polynomial ring Q[H1 , . . . , Hn ] deter-
mines an affine variety in Qn .
Proposition 3.1.2. Let V ⊆ Qn be the common zero locus of P2 (J) for
all J = ±H1 ± H2 ± · · · ± Hn , in types Cn , Dn . In type Bn let V ⊆ Qn
be the common zero locus of P2 (J) for all J, along with P1 (Hi ) for all
i = 1, . . . , n. Then V = Π, the set of weights of E⊗r .
Proof. For fixed r, let T = {−r, −r + 2, . . . , r − 2, r}. This is the set of
m ∈ Z satisfying |m| 6 r, m ≡ r (mod 2). The         P set Π, in types Cn and
                                         n
Dn , is the set of (λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ Z satisfying    |λi | ∈ T .
   Consider v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) ∈ V , a solution to P2 (J) = 0 for all choices
of J = ±H1 ± · · · ± Hn . Then ±v1 ± v2 ± · · · ± vn ∈ T for all possible
sign choices. In particular, for every i with 1 6 i 6 n we have
  v1 + · · · + vn ∈ T and − v1 − · · · − vi−1 + vi − vi+1 − · · · − vn ∈ T.
From this we conclude that 2vi is an even integer since P        the sum of any
two elements of T is even. Thus vi ∈ Z for all i. Since              |vi | ∈ T , the
inclusion V ⊆ Π holds.
    Now take λ = (λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ Π. We need to prove that ±λ1 + · · · ±
λn ∈ TPfor all sign choices. By the description of Π given above, we
know
P              |λi |P∈ T . For any choice σi of signs,
                                                 P      we have
                                                              P the congruence
    σi |λi | ≡        |λi | (mod 2). Moreover, | σi |λi || 6     |λi | 6 r. Thus
Π ⊆ V . This proves that V = Π in types Cn and Dn .
    Now we turn to type Bn . Let T ′ = {−r, −r + 1, . . . r − 1, r} and    P note
that in this case Π is the set of λ1 , . . . , λn ) ∈ Zn satisfying          |λi | ∈
  ′
T . By an argument similar to the above, it follows that the set of
solutions to the equations P1 (J)     P= 0 for all   J coincides with the set of
                       1    n                     ′
(v1 , . . . , vn ) ∈ ( 2 Z) such that    |vi | ∈ T . If the additional equations
P1 (Hi ) = 0 are imposed, then it is clear that the solution set is reduced
exactly to Π = Π(E⊗r ). The proof is complete.                                     
Remark 3.1.3. The proof shows, in particular, that relations (C6), (D6)
are consequences of relations (C7), (D7).                             ⋄

  We now consider the algebra Φ0 = U0 /(U0 ∩ I). By the PBW
theorem, U0 is isomorphic with the algebra Q[H1 , . . . , Hn ] of polyno-
mials in commuting “indeterminates” H1 , . . . , Hn . Define an algebra
Φ′ = U0 /I 0 where I 0 is the ideal in U0 generated by P2 (J) for all J and
P1 (Hi ) for all i, in types Cn , Dn , and is the ideal in U0 generated by
P1 (J) for all J and by P1 (Hi ) for all i, in type Bn . (In types Cn , Dn
the generators P1 (Hi ) are not needed.) Given λ ∈ Π, define an element
1λ ∈ Φ0 by
                                   Y P (λi ) (Hi )
                                         1
(3.1.4)                      1λ =         (λi )
                                    i P1        (λi )
          (k)
where P1 (T ) equals P1 (T ) with factor (T − k) deleted, for a given k
                                          (λ )
satisfying −r 6 k 6 r. Since (Hi − λi )P1 i (Hi ) = 0 (by definition of
Φ) we see from (3.1.4) that
(3.1.5)            H i 1 λ = λi 1 λ   (λ ∈ Π, 1 6 i 6 n).
Proposition 3.1.6. (a) The algebra Φ0 is isomorphic with the algebra
Φ′ .
   (b) The set of all 1λ (λ ∈ Π) is a Q-basis for Φ0 and a Z-basis for
Φ0Z ; moreover, this set is a set of pairwise orthogonal idempotents in
Φ0 which add up to 1.
Proof. View the Hi as coordinate functions on Qn . The algebra Φ′ is
the ring of regular functions on the variety of common zeros of I 0 . By
the previous proposition, this variety is the finite set Π. The coordinate
ring of Π is just the product λ∈Π Qλ where Qλ ∼
                                 Q
                                                       = Q is the function
ring of the λ. (The only functions definedQat a single point are the
constants.) The explicit isomorphism Φ0 ∼   = λ∈Π QQ    λ is realized by the
map (denoted by φ) which sends f (H1 , . . . , Hn ) to λ∈Π f (λ1 , . . . , λn ).
It is easy to check that 1λ (λ′ ) = δλλ′ . Thus, φ(1λ) is a vector whose
entries are all zero except for one entry which equals one. Since φ is an
isomorphism, it follows that the set 1λ (λ ∈ Π) is a Q-basis for Φ′ and
this set is a set of pairwise orthogonal idempotents of Φ′ which add up
to 1.
   By the definition of Φ we have an algebra surjection U → Φ By
restriction, this induces an algebra surjection U0 → Φ0 . The canonical
quotient map U → U/I induces, upon restriction to U0 , a map U0 →
U/I = Φ. The image of this map is Φ0 and its kernel is U0 ∩ I, so
Φ0 ∼= U0 /(U0 ∩ I). Clearly I 0 ⊆ U0 ∩ I. Thus we obtain an algebra
surjection:
(3.1.7)                       Φ′ = U0 /I 0 → Φ0 .
12                     DOTY, GIAQUINTO, AND SULLIVAN

The dimension of Φ′ is the cardinality of Π, the set of weights appearing
in the representation E ⊗r .
   We consider the quotient of the polynomial ring Q[H1 , . . . , Hn ] (the
variables Hi commute) by the ideal I 0 . It suffices to show that this
quotient is isomorphic with |Π| copies of the base field Q. By the
Chinese remainder theorem, applied repeatedly to the factors of the
polynomial P1 (Hi ), for each i = 1, . . . , n, we obtain an isomorphism
                          Y
Q[H1 , . . . , Hn ]/I 0 ≃    Q[H1 , . . . , Hn ]/(H1 −λ1 , . . . , Hn −λn , Pk (J))
                        λ1 ,...,λn

where k = 1 in types Cn , Dn and k = 2 in type Bn . In the product, each
integer λi belongs to the interval [−r, r]. Each factor in the product is
either Q or zero because the relations H1 − λ1 = 0, . . . , Hn − λn = 0
make each variable Hi a constant. Consider the factor for a selection
of constants λ1 , . . . , λn . If those values satisfy the identity Pk (J) = 0
for every choice of J, then the selection of constants gives a weight
of the rth tensor power of E, and the factor Q[H1 , . . . , Hn ]/(H1 −
λ1 , . . . , Hn − λn , Pk (J)) is Q. If the selected values do not satisfy the
relation Pk (J) = 0 for every choice of J, then the evaluation of such
a relation at λ1 , . . . , λn gives a nonzero constant in the ideal, so the
quotient Q[H1 , . . . , Hn ]/(H1 − λ1 , . . . , Hn − λn , Pk (J)) is 0.
   It follows that Φ0 has the same dimension as Φ′ . Thus the surjection
(3.1.7) is an isomorphism of algebras. This proves assertions (a) and
(b).                                                                        
Remark 3.1.8. (a) The argument shows in particular that U0 ∩ I = I 0 ,
an equality which is not obvious from the definitions.
  (b) From the proposition
                       P       and (3.1.5) it follows immediately (by
multiplication
P               by 1 =    λ 1λ ) that in Φ we have the equality Hi =
      λ 1
  λ∈Π i λ   for any i.                                              ⋄
Proposition 3.1.9. The elements ei , fi (1 6 i 6 n), 1λ (λ ∈ Π) of Φ
satisfy relations (R1)–(R8), with Π = W π.

Proof. Relation (R1) was proved in the previous proposition. To prove
(R2), first consider the case i 6= j. Then relations (B2), (C2), (D2) all
assert that ei fj − fj ei = 0, which is precisely relation (R2) in this case.
Now suppose i = j is strictly less than n. Then αi∨ = αi = εi − εi+1 for
types Bn , Cn , and Dn . Thus (αi∨ , λ) = λi − λi+1 . Since i < n, relations
(B2), (C2), (D2) all assert that ei fi − fi ei = Hi − Hi+1 . By Remark
3.1.8(b),
                                   P
                     Hi − Hi+1 = λ∈Π (λi − λi+1 )1λ .
                 PRESENTING GENERALIZED SCHUR ALGEBRAS                          13

This proves (R2) in the case i = j < n. Now consider the final re-
maining case i = j = n. In type Bn , we have αn∨ = 2αn = 2εn ,
and en fn − fn en = 2Hn . Relation (R2) for type Bn now follows
since 2Hn 1λ = (αn∨ , λ)1λ for all λ.. In type Cn , αn∨ = αn /2 = εn
and en fn − en fn = Hn . Relation (R2) for type Cn now follows since
Hn 1λ = (αn∨ , λ)1λ for all λ.. Finally, in type Dn , αn∨ = αn = εn−1 + εn
and en fn − en fn = Hn−1 + Hn . In exactly the same way as for the other
cases, it follows at once that (R2) holds for type Dn .
   We now prove relation (R3). First, from relations (B3), (C3), and
(D3) we see that ej Hi = (Hi − (εi , αj ))ej and so from (3.1.4) we obtain
the equality (in Φ)
(3.1.10)                  ej 1λ = P (H1 , . . . , Hn ) ej
where P (H1 , . . . , Hn ) is defined by

                                               i        P1        (λi )
From Remark 3.1.8(b) and the definition of P (H1, . . . , Hn ) we obtain
the equality
                                     P
(3.1.12)        P (H1, . . . , Hn ) = µ∈Π P (µ1 , . . . , µn )1µ .
In order to analyze this expression, first note that by its definition
  (λ )
P1 i (x) = 0 for all integers x except x = λi or |x| > r + 1. Thus for
a given µ ∈ Π, P (µ1 , . . . , µn ) = 0 unless, for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, one of
the conditions µi − (εi , αj ) = λi or |µi − (εi , αj )| > r + 1 holds.
   Now suppose there exists µ ∈ Π and i ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that |µi −
(εi , αj )| > r + 1. In this case, even though P (µ1 , . . . , µn ) need not
vanish, the product 1µ ej is necessarily zero as we now show. We have
the equality 1µ (Hi − µi ) = 0, so trivially 1µ (Hi − µi )ej = 0. But, using
relation (B3), (C3), or (D3), we may rewrite the last equality in the
form
(3.1.13)                1µ ej (Hi + (εi , αj ) − µi ) = 0.
The rightmost factor, Hi + (εi , αj ) − µi can be expressed via Remark
3.1.8(b) as the sum
                                     X
              Hi + (εi , αj ) − µi =   (νi + (εi , αj ) − µi )1ν
                                        ν∈Π

in which every coefficient differs from zero since we are under the as-
sumption that |µi − (εi , αj )| > r + 1 and each component of an element
of Π lies in the interval [−r, r]. It follows that Hi + (εi , αj ) − µi is an
14                     DOTY, GIAQUINTO, AND SULLIVAN

invertible element of Φ and so we can multiply equation (3.1.13) by its
inverse on the right to obtain the desired result that 1µ ej = 0.
   Thus, the only µ ∈ Π for which P (µ1, . . . µn )1µ ej 6= 0 is determined
by µi − (εi , αj ) = λi for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Thus µ = λ + αj . Moreover,
one easily sees that P (λ + αj ) = 1. Relation (R3) now follows. The
proofs of relations (R4)–(R6) are similar. Finally, (R7) and (R8) hold
since these are among the defining relations for U(g). The proof is
complete.                                                                    

     We note the following corollary for later reference.
Corollary 3.1.14. With π = Π+ (E⊗r ), there is a surjective algebra
homomorphism S(π) → Φ given by ei → ei , fi → fi , 1λ → 1λ .

3.2. The algebra S. Let S = S(π) be the generalized Schur algebra,
given by the generators and relations (R1)–(R8) of 1.4, for types Bn –
Dn . Let Π = Π(E⊗r ) = W π, the set of weights of E⊗r . Define elements
Hi ∈ S by
                          X               X
(3.2.1)             Hi =     (εi , λ)1λ =   λi 1 λ .
                              λ∈Π             λ∈Π

Proposition 3.2.2. With Hi as above, the elements Hi , ei , fi in S
satisfy the relations (B1)–(B7), (C1)–(C7), (D1)–(D7) in types Bn ,
Cn , Dn respectively.

Proof. The first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth relations are the same
for all types, so the argument differs only for the second and seventh
relations. Moreover, the fourth and fifth relations are the same as (R7)
and (R8), so we only need to establish the first, second, third, sixth,
and seventh relations.
   It follows from the definition (3.2.1) of the elements Hi and the
commutativity of the 1λ that the elements Hi , Hj commute in S. This
proves the first relation (B1), (C1), (D1).
   We consider the third relation. We will show that Hi ej − ej Hi =
(εi , αj )ej . At this point, it is convenient to set 1λ = 0 for all λ ∈ X −Π.
Then the sums in (R1), (R2), and (3.2.1) can be taken over X. The
relations (R3), (R5) may be expressed by the single equality
(3.2.3)               ei 1λ = 1λ+αi ei    (all i, λ ∈ X)
and (R4), (R6) may be expressed as
(3.2.4)              fi 1λ = 1λ−αi fi    (all i, λ ∈ X).

From (3.2.1), (3.2.3), by reindexing the first sum we obtain
                          P                  P
          Hi ej − ej Hi = λ (εi , λ)1λ ej − λ (εi , λ)ej 1λ

                        = λ (εi , λ)ej 1λ−αj − λ (εi , λ)ej 1λ
                          P                         P
                        = λ (εi , λ + αj )ej 1λ − λ (εi , λ)ej 1λ
                          P
                        = λ (εi , αj )ej 1λ = (εi , αj )ej ,
by the second part of (R1), where the sums are taken over X. This
proves the first part of (B3), (C3), and (D3). The proof of the second
part is entirely similar, using (3.2.4) instead of (3.2.3).
  We consider the sixth relation. We have equalities
   (Hi + r) · · · Hi · · · (Hi − r)
          X                         X                  X
       = ( (εi , λ)1λ + r) · · · ( (εi , λ)1λ ) · · · ( (εi , λ)1λ − r)
            λ∈Π                          λ∈Π                          λ∈Π
            X                                  X                            X
       =(         ((εi , λ) + r)1λ ) · · · (         (εi , λ)1λ ) · · · (         ((εi , λ) − r)1λ )
            λ∈Π                                λ∈Π                          λ∈Π
           X
       =         [((εi , λ) + r) · · · (εi , λ) · · · ((εi , λ) − r)]1λ
           λ∈Π

(since the 1λ are orthogonal idempotents). The last expression above
equals 0, i.e., all its coefficients equal 0, because for λ ∈ Π, (εi , λ) = λi
is an integer between −r and r. This proves (B6), (C6), and (D6).
    We consider (B2). We must show that ei fi − fi ei = δij (Hi − Hi+1 ),
when i < n and ei fi − fi ei = δij (2Hn ), when i = n. When i 6= j,
ei fi − fi ei = 0 by (R2), so we are reduced to the case i = j. By (3.2.1),
for i < n we have
                       P
       Hi − Hi+1 = λ∈Π (εi − εi+1 , λ)1λ
                    = λ∈Π (αi , λ)1λ = λ∈Π (αi∨ , λ)1λ = ei fi − fi ei ,

by relation (R2).P       (We used the equality
                                           P αi =∨ αi for i < n.) For i = n,
we have 2Hn = λ∈Π (2εn , λ)1λ = λ∈Π (αn , λ)1λ = en fn − fn en , by
(R2). This proves (B2). The proof of (C2) and (D2) is similar.
                                             Pn
   We consider (B7). Consider J =              i=1 σi Hi for a given choice of
signs (σ1 , . . . , σn ) in {1, −1}n . Then we have
              J = ni=1 σi λ∈Π (εi , λ)1λ = ni=1 λ∈Π σi λi 1λ .
                     P         P               P P

For any integer s we have equalities
                            P P                P
                 (J + s) = ( i λ σi λi 1λ ) + ( λ s1λ )

16                   DOTY, GIAQUINTO, AND SULLIVAN

where i varies from 1 to n and λ varies over Π. Hence we obtain
                                         r X X

                                       λ∈Π s=−r        i=1

The last expression vanishes since, for each λ ∈ Π, ±λ1 ± · · · ± λn is an
integer between −r and r. This proves (B7). The proof of (C7), (D7)
is similar.                                                              
Corollary 3.2.5. There is a surjective algebra

mapping ei → ei , fi → fi , and Hi → Hi = λ∈Π (εi , λ)1λ.

3.3. Conclusion of the proof. Corollary 3.1.14 shows that S is a
quotient of Φ. Corollary 3.2.5 shows that Φ is a quotient of S. It
follows that Φ is isomorphic with S = S(π), and hence Theorems 2.1.1,
2.2.1, and 2.3.1 are proved.

                         4. A basis for S(π)
   Let g be a Lie algebra of classical type defined over Q. As before,
let π = Π+ (E⊗r ). We would like to give a canonical basis for the
generalized Schur algebra S(π) in terms of the elements of the universal
enveloping algebra.
   Since S(π) is the direct sum of endomorphism algebras of simple
factors of E⊗r , we consider first the problem of finding a basis for the
full matrix algebra End(M) of an irreducible module M. To give a
basis for End(M) in terms of the elements of the universal enveloping
algebra, we will exploit Littelmann’s basis for M.

4.1. Littelmann’s basis. Let h be a Cartan subalgebra of g. Let
R ⊂ h∗ be the set of roots of h in g, i.e., the nonzero eigenvalues for the
adjoint representation of h on g, and let S be the set of simple roots
relative to some hyperplane in h∗ . For each simple root α, let sα be
the corresponding element of the Weyl group of the root system. Fix
a reduced expression sα1 · · · sαm for the longest word w0 in the Weyl
group of g in terms of the set {sα | α ∈ S}.
   Let XQ be the rational span of the weight lattice of g within h∗ .
Consider the set of paths x : [0, 1] → XQ that begin at the origin, and
take Π to be the free Z-module on that set. In [L1, §1], Littelmann
defines certain operators {f˜α }α∈S and {ẽα }α∈S on Π. The value of f˜α
at a path x(t) with endpoint x(1) either is the 0-element of Π or is a
                  PRESENTING GENERALIZED SCHUR ALGEBRAS                               17

particular path f˜α · x with endpoint x(1) − α. In an inverse sense, the
value of ẽα at a path x(t) with endpoint x(1) either is the 0-element of
Π or it is a particular path ẽα · x with endpoint x(1) + α. Let A be the
algebra generated by those operators.
   Consider any path Pλ in the dominant chamber that terminates at
an integral weight λ. Pλ generates an irreducible A-module Mλ . In
terms of the chosen reduced expression w0 = sα1 · · · sαm , consider the
elements of A of the form f˜αn11 · · · f˜αnmm . Littelmann shows that the
elements f˜αn11 · · · f˜αnmm · Pλ span Mλ . Moreover, in [L2, §§6–7], he gives a
geometric description of a set Sλ of sequences of exponents n1 , ..., nm
such that, as (n1 , ..., nm ) ranges over Sλ , the elements f˜αn11 · · · f˜αnmm · Pλ
form a basis for Mλ .
   For each simple root α, let fα and eα be nonzero elements of the
root spaces of g corresponding respectively to the roots −α and α,
satisfying [eα , fα ] = α∨ ∈ h∗ . Let L(λ) be the irreducible g-module of
highest weight λ, and vλ be a highest weight vector. In [L2, Theorem
10.1], using the theory of crystal bases, Littelmann shows that as the
sequences (n1 , ..., nm ) range over Sλ , the elements fαn11 · · · fαnmm · vλ form
a basis for L(λ).
   Let Sλopp be the set of sequences (nm , ..., n1 ), where (n1 , ..., nm ) ranges
over Sλ . Let uλ be a lowest weight vector in L(λ). By the same theory of
crystal bases, as (t1 , ..., tm ) ranges over Sλopp , the elements etα11 · · · etαmm ·uλ,
form a basis for L(λ).


4.2. Basis for End(L(λ)). Consider the dual module L(λ)∗ . Its weights
are the negatives of the weights of L(λ), and its highest weight is
−w0 (λ), since the lowest weight of L(λ) is w0 (λ). Furthermore, the
lowest weight of L(λ)∗ is −λ, and as a lowest weight vector, we can
take the element χvλ that is 1 at vλ and 0 at all weight vectors of other
weights. Hence, by the preceding paragraph, as (t1 , ..., tm ) ranges over
  opp
S−w  0 (λ)
           , the elements etα11 · · · etαmm · χvλ , form a basis for L(λ)∗ .
  Let 1λ be the element of End(L(λ)) that acts as 1 on the highest
weight line of L(λ) and acts as 0 on the other weight spaces.

Theorem 4.2.1. Let λ be a dominant integral weight. As {n1 , ..., nm }
                                                   opp
range over Sλ , and as {t1 , ..., tm } range over S−w 0 (λ)
                                                            , the elements

                           {fαn11 · · · fαnmm 1λ etα11 · · · etαmm }

form a basis for End(L(λ)).
18                    DOTY, GIAQUINTO, AND SULLIVAN

Proof. Under the natural identification of L(λ)⊗L(λ)∗ with End(L(λ)),
the element
                    fαn11 · · · fαnmm · vλ ⊗ etα11 · · · etαmm · χvλ
of L(λ) ⊗ L(λ)∗ corresponds to the element
                          fαn11 · · · fαnmm 1λ etα11 · · · etαmm
of End(L(λ)).                                                             
Corollary 4.2.2. In Lie algebras of type Bn , Cn , or Dn , as {n1 , ..., nm }
range over Sλ , and as {t1 , ..., tm } range over Sλopp , the elements
                        {fαn11 · · · fαnmm 1λ etα11 · · · etαmm }
form a basis for End(L(λ)).

Proof. In those types, w0 = −I.                                           

4.3. Basis for S(π). Consider the generalized Schur algebra S(π) for
π = Π+ (E⊗rL ) in types Bn , Cn , and Dn . S(π) is isomorphic with the
direct sum λ∈π End(L(λ)). In [D, 6.10] it is proved that an idempo-
tent 1µ (µ ∈ W π = Π(E⊗r )) acts on any S(π)-module M as 1 on the
eigenspace of M of value µ, and acts as 0 on the eigenspaces of M of
all other values.
Theorem 4.3.1. The algebra S(π) has a basis consisting of all ele-
ments of the form
                         fαn11 · · · fαnmm 1λ(i) etα11 · · · etαmm
such that
                   {n1 , ..., nm } ∈ Sλ ; {t1 , ..., tm } ∈ Sλopp
as λ varies over π.

Proof. (By induction on the partial order on π.) Let λ be a maximal
weight of π. The element
                          fαn11 · · · fαnmm 1λ etα11 · · · etαmm
is zero in End(L(λ′ )) for each λ′ ∈ π different from λ. Such elements
give a basis for the endomorphism algebra of L(λ). By induction we
may assume the basis has been established as stated for the generalized
Schur algebra S(π\{λ}). Note that π\{λ} is saturated.                

Appendix A. Irreducible factors in the rth tensor power
                      of the natural module

   Weyl [W] describes the irreducible factors in the rth tensor power of
the natural module for a classical group. For convenience, we summa-
rize here the results from [W] needed in the paper.

Type Bn = SO2n+1 . Let T be a diagram with row lengths f1 > f2 >
· · · ft > 0, with t 6 n. The diagram T ′ associated to T has row lengths
f1 > f2 > · · · ft > ft+1 > · · · > f2n+1−t , where ft+1 = ft+2 = · · · =
f2n+1−t = 1, i.e., T ′ is obtained by adding 2n − 2t + 1 boxes to the first
column of T . The irreducible SO2n+1 -modules associated to T and T ′
are isomorphic with highest weight of exponents f1 > f2 > · · · > ft .
(Weyl, Chapter 7, equations 9.10 and 9.11.) The pairs {T, T ′} partition
Weyl’s set of permissible diagrams (Weyl p. 155).
    The following is Weyl’s Theorem 5.7F for the group SO2n+1 .
Theorem A.1. For each pair {T, T ′} of permissible diagrams, the ir-
reducible module corresponding  to T is a factor of the rth tensor power
of the natural module iff tj=1 fj = m−2k, for some k > 0, and the ir-
                         P
reducible module corresponding
                         P2n+1−tto T ′ is a factor of the rth tensor power
of the natural module iff j=1 fj = m − 2k for some k > 0.
Remark. Weyl’s theorem is stated for the full orthogonal group, but
in section 9 of Chapter 6, he shows that irreducible modules for the
full orthogonal group remain irreducible for the proper orthgonal group
when the dimension of the natural module is odd.

   Because fj = 1 for j = t + 1, ..., 2n + 1 − t, we can write the condition
on T ′ in the theorem as tj=1 fj + (2n − 2t + 1) = m − 2k for some
                          P

k > 0, or equally, as tj=1 fj + (2n − 2t) = m − 2k − 1 for some k > 0.
                     P

   We can give the irreducible factors of the rth tensor power in the
following theorem:
Theorem A.2. The irreducible factors of the rth tensor power of the
natural module for SO2n+1 are those whose highest characters have ex-
ponents f1 > f2 > · · · > ft > 0 with t 6 n, where either
  (i) tj=1 fj = m − 2k, for some k > 0, or
      P

  (ii) tj=1 fj + (2n − 2t) = m − 2k − 1, for some k > 0.
      P

  The theorem can be restated in a slightly different form:
20                   DOTY, GIAQUINTO, AND SULLIVAN

Theorem A.3. The irreducible factors of the rth tensor power of the
natural module for SO2n+1 are those whose highest characters have ex-
ponents f1 > f2 > · · · > fn > 0, where either
  (i) nj=1 fj = m − 2k, for some k > 0, or
      P

  (ii) nj=1 fj = m − 2k ′ − 1, for some k ′ > 0, for which fn−k′ 6= 0.
      P


Proof. Set k ′ = n + k − t to interchange parts (ii) of the theorems A.2
and A.3. Note that the condition k > 0 translates into the condition
t > n − k′.                                                           

Type Cn = Sp2n . Consider the diagrams T with row lengths f1 >
f2 > · · · > fn > 0. For the symplectic group Sp2n , the irreducible
modules correspond to the diagrams T . The irreducible Sp2n -module
corresponding to the diagram T is a factor of the rth tensor power of
the natural module if and only if f1 + f2 + · · · + fn = m − 2k for some
k > 0.
   In terms of highest weights, we have the following (Weyl, Chapter 6,
p. 175 and Theorem 7.8D):
Theorem A.4. Consider sequences of integers f1 > f2 > · · · > fn > 0.
The irreducible factors of the rth tensor power of the natural module for
Sp2n are those whose highest characters have exponents (f1 , f2 , ..., fn ),
where f1 + f2 + · · · + fn = m − 2k, for some k > 0.

Type Dn = SO2n . The permissible diagrams for the full orthogonal
group O2n are those whose first two columns have combined length no
more than 2n. The irreducible modules for the full orthogonal group
O2n correspond to the permissible diagrams (Weyl Theorem 5.7F).
   The set of permissible diagrams can be partitioned into pairs of as-
sociated diagrams as follows. Let T be a diagram with row lengths
f1 > f2 > · · · > ft > 0, with t 6 n. The diagram T ′ associated to
T has row lengths f1 > f2 > · · · > ft > ft+1 > · · · > f2n−t , where
ft+1 = ft+2 = · · · = f2n−t = 1, i.e., T ′ is a permissible diagram ob-
tained from the permissible diagram T by adding 2n − 2t boxes to the
first column of T . By Weyl’s theorem 5.7F for O2n , the irreducible
module corresponding to T is P a factor of the rth tensor power of the
natural module exactly when tj=1 fj = m − 2k, for some k > 0, and
the irreducible module corresponding to T ′ is Pa factor of the rth tensor
                                                   2n−t              ′
power of the natural module exactly when           j=1 fj = m − 2k , for
some k ′ > 0. Because
                   Pt ft+1 = ft+2 = · · · = f2n−t     = 1, that condition
can be written as j=1 fj = m − 2(n − t) − 2k , for some k ′ > 0.

   Consider the pair {T, T ′ }. If T ′ satisfies the condition tj=1 fj =
                                                                 P

Pt− 2(n − t) − 2k , for some k > 0, then T satisfies          the condition

   j=1 fj = m − 2k, for the value k = (n − t) + k > 0. Hence, if the
diagram T ′ corresponds to a factor of the rth tensor power, so does the
diagram T .
   When we restrict the irreducible O2n -modules corresponding to T
and T ′ to the proper orthogonal group SO2n , there are two cases to con-
sider (Weyl, Theorems 5.9A and 7.9). In the first case, t < n. There,
T and T ′ are distinct diagrams that correspond to nonisomorphic O2n -
modules. Upon restriction to SO2n , those modules become isomorphic
irreducible SO2n -modules. The highest character of that irreducible
SO2n -module has nonzero exponents (f1 , f2 , ..., ft ), with t < n. In the
second case, t = n. There, T = T ′ , and the corresponding irreducible
O2n -module, upon restriction to SO2n , splits into two nonisomorphic
irreducible SO2n -modules, one whose highest character has exponents
(f1 , f2 , ..., fn−1 , fn ) and the other whose highest character has expo-
nents (f1 , f2 , ..., fn−1 , −fn ).
   The following theorem gives the isomorphism classes of the irre-
ducible SO2n -modules in the rth tensor power of the natural module,
summing up the conclusions of the preceding paragraphs.
TheoremP         A.5. Consider sequences of integers f1 > f2 > · · · > fn > 0
such that nj=1 fj = m − 2k, for some k > 0.. The irreducible modules
in the rth tensor power of the natural module for SO2n are those whose
highest characters have exponents (f1 , f2 , ..., fn−1, fn ) with fn = 0, and
those whose highest characters have exponents (f1 , f2 , ..., fn−1 , fn ) or
(f1 , f2 , ..., fn−1 , −fn ), with fn > 0.
