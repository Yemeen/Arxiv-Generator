     Abstract. In this paper, we consider the most non-split parabolic D4 type preho-
     mogeneous vector space. The vector space is an analogue of the space of Hermitian
     forms. We determine the principal part of the zeta function.




Introduction
   Throughout this paper, k is a number eld. Let k1 be a cubic extension of k,
and k2 the Galois closure of k1. Then either k2 = k1 is a cyclic cubic extension
of k or k2 is an S3 {extension of k. In this paper, we consider the zeta function
dened for a prehomogeneous vector space (G; V ) which becomes the D4 case in
[6] after extending the base eld from k to k2 . We consider the most non-split case
here and the vector space is an analogue of the space of Hermitian forms except it
depends on three two dimensional vectors. So we call this space the space of binary
tri-Hermitian forms. We discussed the meaning of this case in [1].
   The purpose of this paper is to determine the principal part of the zeta function.
Our main result is Theorem (3.6). In x1, we dene the prehomogeneous vector
space in this paper, and prove a stratication of this vector space. Since our group
is non-split, we cannot directly apply Kempf's theorem on the rationality of the
equivariant Morse stratication [2], even though it does not seem so dicult to
make necessary adjustments. However, since our representation is rather small, we
will handle the stratication explicitly. We will probably consider such adjustments
for general non-split prehomogeneous vector spaces in the future.
   In x2, we dene the zeta function, the Fourier transform, and the smoothed
Eisenstein series. Our method for computing the principal part of the zeta function
is similar to that of [3], [5], [7], [8]. In x3, we will analyze the terms which come
from the set of unstable points, and prove a principal part formula.
   For basic notion on adeles, see [4]. The ring of adeles, the group of ideles, and
the adelic absolute value of k are denoted by A ; A  ; j j respectively. We x a non-
trivial character < > of A =k. The ring of adeles, the group of ideles, and the adelic
absolute value of k1 are denoted by A k1 ; A k1 ; j jk1 respectively. Note that by the

inclusion A ! A k1 , an idele (av )v corresponds to the idele (bw )w such that bw = av
if w is a place over v. Let A 1 = ft 2 A j jtj = 1g; A 1k1 = ft 2 A k1 j jtjk1 = 1g.
Identifying k1 
 A = A k1 the norm map Nk1 =k can be extended to a map from A k1
to A . It is known (see [4, p. 139]) that jNk1=k (t)j = jtjk1 for t 2 A k1 . The set of
positive real numbers is denoted by R+.
   Suppose [k : Q] = n. Then [k1 : Q1] = 3n. For  2 R+,  2 A  is the idele whose
component at any innite place is  n and whose component at any nite    1
                                                                             place is 1.
              
Also k1 2 A k1 is the idele whose component at any innite place is  3n and whose
component at any nite place is 1. Clearly,  = 3k1 . Since jj =  and jk1 jk1 = ,
this means that jjk1 = 3.
   If X is a variety over k and R is a k{algebra, the set of R{rational points of X
is denoted by XR . The space of Schwartz{Bruhat functions on VA is denoted by
S (VA ). If f; g are functions on a set X , f  g means that there is a constant C
such that f (x)  Cg(x) for all x 2 X .

x1 The space of binary tri-Hermitian forms
   Let G1 = GL(1)k ; G2 = GL(2)k1 , and G = G1  G2 . We consider G as a
group overk. Let Ve =k22 
 k22 
 k22. We rst x a coordinate system for Ve .
Let f1 = 10 ; f2 = 01 , and eijk = fi 
 fj 
 fk for i; j; k = 1; 2. Then
feijkPj i; j; k = 1; 2g is a basis for Ve . So any element x 2 Ve can be expressed as
x = i;j;k xijk eijk , where xijk 2 k2 for all i; j; k.
   We choose three dierent imbeddings 1 ; 2 ; 3 : k1 ! k2 over k. Let H1 =
Gal(k2=k), and H2 = Gal(k2 =k1). Then H2 is a subgroup of H1 and [H1 : H2] = 3.
So there exists a homomorphism h : H1 ! S3 such that H2i  = H2h()(i) for
i = 1; 2; 3. (Here if 1; 2 2 S3, (12)(i) = 2(1 (i)).) We dene a right action of
H1 on Ve by
                 (x1 
 x2 
 x3 ) = xh( 1 )(1) 
 xh( 1 )(2) 
 xh( 1 )(3):
Let V = Ve H1 . Then V is a vector space over k. We dene an action of G on V by
                   (t1 ; g)x1 
 x2 
 x3 = t1 g1 x1 
 g2 x2 
 g3 x3 :
   We choose and x  2 H1 so that h() = (1; 2; 3). Then we use 1 = 1; 2 =
; 3 = 2 as three dierent imbeddings. If k2 is an S3 {extension of k, this
means that we are restricting elements of Gal(k2 =k) to k1 . Also since 1 = 1, the
non-trivial element  2 H2 corresponds to the transposition (2; 3).
   Note
    P   that if x1 ; x2 ; x3 2 k, (x1 
 x2 
 x3 ) = x3 
 x1 
 x2 . This means that if
x = i;j;k xijk eijk ,
                 x = x111 e111 + x112e211 + x121e112 + x122 e212
                          + x211 e121 + x212e221 + x221 e122 + x222 e222:
Also
                 x = x111e111 + x112 e121 + x121e112 + x211e211
                          + x122e122 + x212 e221 + x221 e212 + x222e222 :
                                           2
Therefore, x 2 V is equivalent to
                 x111; x222 2 k; x211 ; x122 2 k1 ;
                 x122 = x212; x1222 = x221 ; x211 = x121; x2112 = x112 :
So x is determined by x111; x222 2 k and x122; x211 2 k1.
   We proved in [1] that (G; V ) is a prehomogeneous vector space.
   Let T2  G2 be the subgroup of diagonal matrices, N2  G2 the subgroup
of lower triangular matrices with diagonal entries 1, and B2 = T2N2 . We dene
T = G1  T2; N = f1g  N2. Then B = TN is a Borel subgroup of G. We dene

where t21; t22 2 A k1 ; u 2 A k1 . We use the same notation for elements (1; a(t21 ; t22 ))
and (1; n(u)). Then T2 , N2 consist of elements of the form a(t21 ; t22 ); n(u) respec-
tively.
   The action of a(t21 ; t22 ) is given by
        a(t21 ; t22)x = Nk1=k (t21 )x111 e111 + t21t221 Nk1 =k (t22 )x122 e122

For t1 2 GL(1)k , the action is given by the usual multiplication of t1.
  By easy computations,
          n(u)e111 = e111 + ue211 + u e121 + u2 e112
                            2           2
                     + u u e122 + uu e212 + uu e221 + Nk1=k (u)e222 ;
          n(u)e112 = e112 + ue212 + u e122 + uu e222;
          n(u)e121 = e121 + ue221 + u2 e122 + uu2 e222 ;
          n(u)e122 = e122 + ue222;
          n(u)e211 = e211 + u e221 + u2 e212 + u u2 e222;
          n(u)e212 = e212 + u e222;
          n(u)e221 = e221 + u2 e222 ;
          n(u)e222 = e222 :
                     P
Therefore, if n(u)x = i;j;k yijk eijk ,
         y111 = x111;
         y211 = x211 + ux111;
         y122 = x122 + u u2 x111 + u x2112 + u2 x211 ;
         y222 = x222 + Nk1=k (u)x111 + Trk1 =k (u u2 x211 ) + Trk1 =k (ux122):
                                              3
   The element x is obtained by exchanging 1 and 2 in the indices of eijk 's (for
example e122 = e211).
   The relative invariant of (G; V ) can be constructed in the following manner. For
x = (xijk ) 2 Ve , we associate a 2  2 matrix with entries in the space of linear forms
in two variables v = (v1 ; v2 ) as
                                                          
                               x
               x ! Mx (v) = v1 x111 x121   + v2 xx 112 x 122   :
                                211 x221           212 x222
Then Fx(v) = det Mx(v) is a quadratic form in v = (v1 ; v2 ).
  By an easy computation,
            Fx(v) = (x111 x1222 x211 x211)v12
                                        2 2
                     + (x111 x222 + x211 x122 x211 x122 x211 x122)v1 v2
                           2
                     + (x211   x222 x122 x122)v22 :
Let (x) be the discriminant of Fx(v).
  We showed in [6] that
                    ((g1; g2; g3 )x) = (det g1 det g2 det g3)2 (x)
for g1; g2; g3 2 GL(2)k2 ; x 2 Ve . So if we put (g) = Nk1=k (det g) for g 2 GL(2)k1 ,
 is a k{rational character of G and ((g)x) = (g)2 (x). We proved in [1] that
(x) 2 k[V ]. We dene Vkss = fx 2 Vk j (x) 6= 0g and call it the set of semi-stable
points. If x 2 Vk n f0g is not semi-stable, we say it is unstable.
   For the rest of this section, we will consider a stratication of Vk . Let
  Y1 = fx 2 V j x111 = x211 = 0g; Y1ss = fx 2 Y1 j x122 6= 0g;
  Z1 = fx 2 V j x111 = x211 = x222 = 0g; Z1ss = fx 2 Z1 j x122 6= 0g;
  Y2 = Z2 = fx 2 V j x111 = x211 = x122 = 0g; Y2ss = Z2ss = fx 2 Z2 j x222 6= 0g:
We dene Si = GYiss for i = 1; 2.
Proposition (1.2) (1) Vk n f0g = Vkss ` S1k ` S2k .
(2) Sik 
        = Gk Bk Yikss for i = 1; 2.
Proof. Let x 2 Vk n f0g be an unstable point. We rst prove that there exists
g 2 Gk such that Fgx (v) = v22.
   If
                   x111x1222 x211x211 = x2112 x222 x122 x122 = 0;
Fgx (v) is a scalar multiple  of v1 v2 and x 2 Vkss. Applying  if necessary, we may
                     2
assume that x111 x122    x211 x211 6= 0.
   Let u 2 k1 and y = n(u)x. By an easy computation,
       Fy (v) = (x111 x1222 x211 x211)v12 + (A(x) + 2B(x)u)2 v1 v2 + C (x)v22 ;
                                           4
where
                   A(x) = x111 x222 + 2x211 x122 Trk1=k (x211 x122 );
                   B(x) = x111 x122 x211 x2112 ;
and we don't have to know      what C (x) is.
   If x211 6= 0, x211 x211 = Nk1 =k (x211 )x2111 2 k1. Also x111; x222 2 k  k1 and
                       2
x211 ; x122 2 k1. Therefore, we can choose u 2 k1 so that the second term becomes
zero. Since x is unstable, this means that the third term is zero also. Then for a
suitable t1 2 k, Ft1 y (v) = v22 .
   Next we prove that for any unstable point x 2 Vk , there exists g 2 Gk such
that gx 2 Y1k . If x 6= 0, this means either
                                               gx 2 Y1ssk or Y2ssk . We may assume that
Fx(v) = v22 . So the matrix xx111 xx2112 is not invertible. If x111 = 0, x211 = 0
                                         

                                    211 122
also. So x 2 Y1. Assume that x111 6= 0. Let u2 k1 and y = n(u)x. Then
y111 = x111 ; y211 = x211 + ux111 and the matrix yy111 yy211
                                                                      
                                                                      2   is not invertible
                                                             211 122
either. We can choose u so that y211 = 0. This implies y122 = 0. If y222 6= 0, Fy (v)
is a scalar multiple of v1 v2 which is a contradiction. Therefore, y222 = 0. Then
y 2 Z2.
   Next we prove that if x; y 2 Y1ssk and gx = y for g 2 Gk , there exists g0 2 Bk such
that g0x = y. Note that because
                              ` of the Bruhat decomposition of GL(2)k1 , we have
a decomposition Gk = Bk Bk Bk . If g 2 Bk , there is nothing to prove. If g 2
Bk Bk , by replacing x if necessary, we may assume that g = (t1; a2 (t21 ; t22)n(u) )
for certain t1 2 k; t21; t22 2 k1; u 2 k1. If x0 = (x0ikj ) = x, x0211 6= 0. If x0111 6= 0,
y111 6= 0 which is a contradiction. If x0111 = 0, since x0211 6= 0, y211 6= 0 which is a
contradiction also. Therefore, we can take the above g from Bk .
   The argument is similar for S2, and this proves the proposition.
                                                                                      Q.E.D.

x2 The zeta function and the smoothed Eisenstein series
  In this section, we dene the zeta function and discuss basic properties of the
smoothed Eisenstein series.
  Let
G02A = fg 2 G2A j j det gj1 = 1g; G0A = A 1  G02A ;
B21A = fa(k1 t21 ; k11t22)n(u) j  2 R+; t21 ; t22 2 A 1k1 ; u 2 A k1 g; BA1 = A 1  B21A :

    We dene GeA k = R+  G0A k . The group GeA acts on VA by assuming that
  2 R+ acts by multiplication by . Throughout this paper, we express elements
eg 2 GeA ; g0 2 G0A as ge = (; t1 ; g2 ); g0 = (t1; g2 ) where  2 R+; t1 2 A 1 , and
 g2 2 G02A . We identify the element g0 with (1; g0) and g2 2 G02A with (1; 1; g2 ). Let
K1  A be the unique maximal compact subgroup, and K2  G2A the standard
maximal compact subgroup. Then K = K1  K2 is aRmaximal compact subgroup
of G0A . Let dk be the Haar measure on K such that K dk = 1. Throughout this
                                              5
paper, we express elements of BA1 as
                            b1 = (t1 ; a(k1 t21; k11t22)n(u));
where t1 2 A 1 ; t21; t22 2 A 1k1 ;  2 R+; u 2 k1 .
   We use the Haar measure d t0 on t0 2 A 1 or A 1k1 such that the volume of A 1 =k
or A 1k1 =k1 is 1. If t = t0 or k1 t0 where t0 2 A 1 or A 1k1 , we use d t = dd t0 as
the Haar measure on A 1 or A 1k1 . We do not use the subscript k1 for the measure
on A 1k1 because the situation will be clear from the context. We use the measure
                          db1 =  2 dt1 dd t21dt22 du
on BA1 . We use dg0 = dkdb1 as the Haar measure on G0A . Let dg2 be the Haar
measure on G0A which we dened in x1.1 of [8]. Then dg0 = d t1dg2. We dene
deg = ddg0.
    For  > 0, we dene
                      T20+ = fa(k1 ; k11) j  2 R+;   g:
Let 
  B20A be a compact subset. We dene S0 = KT20+
. The set S0 is called a
Siegel set. It is known that for a suitable choice of  and 
, S0 surjects to G02A =G2k .
 Also there exists another compact set 
b  G02A such that S0  
b T20+.
    For x = (xijk ); y = (yijk ) 2 V , we dene
               [x; y]0 = x111 y111 + Trk1 =k (x211 y211 + x122 y122) + x222 y222:
This is a non-degenerate bilinear form on V dened over k. By an easy computation,
[gx; y] = [x; t gy] for g = (t1 ; a2 (t21 ; t22)); ; n(u) and x; y 2 VA . So this is true
for all g 2 G and x; y 2 VA . We dene [x; y] = [x; y]. For eg 2 Ge, we dene
eg = ( 1 ; t 1 ;  tg2 1 ). This is an involution and the above bilinear form satises
[egx; y] = [x; (eg ) 1 y] for all x; y 2 VA .
    For  2 S (VA ), we dene its Fourier transform by
                                       Z
                            b (x) =        (y) < [x; y] > dy:
                                       VA

It is easy to see that the Fourier transform of (eg ) is  8b (eg ).
Denition (2.1) For any Gk {invariant subset S  Vk and  2 S (VA ), we dene
                                                   X
                                 S (; eg) =            (egx):
                                                   x2S

  Note that by Proposition (1.2), if x 2 Vkss, (x111 ; x211) 6= 0 and (x122 ; x222) 6= 0.
Therefore, by Lemma (1.2.3) and Lemma (1.2.6) in [8], we get the following lemma.
Lemma (2.2) (1) There exists a slowly increasing function h(; ) such that for
any N1 ; N2  1,
   Vkss (; ge)  sup(() N1 ; (3 ) N1 ) sup(( 1 ) N2 ; (3  1) N1 )h(; ):
                                               6
(2) The function Vk (; ge) is slowly increasing.
   Note that x211; x122 2 k1 and k1 is a vector space of dimension 3 over k. So when
x211 6= 0, we 1are applying Lemma (1.2.6) in [8] with mij = 3 for a suitable (i; j ).
Also k1 =  3 . So the multiplication of k1 can be considered as a multiplication
of an element of A . This is why we get the factor 3  or 3  1.
   Let !1 ; !2 be characters of A k =k; A k1 =k1 respectively. We put ! = (!1 ; !2).
For this !, we dene a character of GeA k =Gk by !(eg) = !1(t1 )!2(det g2). We dene
(!1 ) = 1 if !1 is a trivial character and (!1 ) = 0 otherwise. We dene (!2 )
similarly.
Denition (2.3) For  2 S (VA ), ! as above and a complex variable s, we dene

   By Lemma (2.2), the integral (1) converges absolutely and locally uniformly in
a certain right half plane and the integral (2) is an entire function. This means
that (G; V ) is of complete type (see [8, p. 64]) and therefore, by Theorem (0.3.7)
in [8] (which is due to Shintani), Z (; !; s) can be continued meromorphically to
the entire plane and satises a functional equation
                          Z (; !; s) = Z (b ; ! 1 ; 8 s):
   For  2 R+ and  2 S (VA ), we dene  (x) = (x). Let

Then by the Poisson summation formula,
              Z (; !; s) = Z+(; !; s) + Z+(b ; ! 1; 8 s) + I (; !; s):
   We study the last term in x3. For that purpose, we briey discuss basic properties
of the smoothed Eisenstein series. For z = (z1; z2 ) 2 C 2 such that z1 + z2 = 0, we
dene a(t21 ; t22 )z = jt21jzk11 jt22 jzk21 . Let  = ( 21 ; 12 ). We can consider  as half the
sum of positive weights. Let (z) be an entire function which is rapidly decreasing
with respect to Im(z) on any vertical strip. Moreover, we assume that
                                                                1 1

Let E (g2 ; w; ) be the smoothed Eisenstein series dened for g2 2 G02A and a com-
plex variable w. For the denition of E (g2; w; ), see [3, p. 172], [5, p. 526], [7,
p. 368], or [8, p. 75], (we are applying the denition in [5], [7], [8] replacing k by
k1). Since the dependency on is not so crucial, we drop and use the notation
E (g2 ; w) instead.
   Let s = z1 z2. Since z1 + z2 = 0, can be considered as a function of s. With
this understanding,  corresponds to s = 1. We dene

It is well known that Vk1 2 is the volume of G02A =G2k .
   The following Proposition is well known.

possibly for a simple pole at w = 1 with residue

x3 The principal part formula
   In this section, we determine the principal part of the zeta function. For that
purpose, we rst have to dene distributions which appear in the inductive com-
putation.
Denition (3.1) (1) Let 	1; 	2 be Schwartz{Bruhat functions on A ; A k1 respec-
tively. Then for t1 2 A  ; t2 2 kk1 , we dene

(2) Let !1; !2 be characters of A  =k ; A k1 =k1 respectively. For a complex variable
s, we dene

   These are more or less the Dedekind zeta functions of k; k1 respectively. They
can be continued meromorphically to the entire plane with possible simple poles at
s = 0; 1.

Denition (3.4) (1) #(!) = (!1 )(!2 ).

   Note that M! M!  = M!  and Z (; !; s) = Z (M! ; !; s). So in order to study
Z (; !; s), we may assume that M!  = . The following theorem is the main

Lemma (3.10)               Z

                           BA1 =Bk
Proof. By Lemma (1.2.8) in [8], for any N  1,
                         Y ss (; b1 )  N sup(1; ):
                                       1k
  So on any vertical strip in Re(w) > 0, for any N  1; l > 2,
                   Y1ssk (; b1 )Ee(b1 ; w)  N +1 2l sup(1; ):
This proves the lemma.
                                                                            Q.E.D.
  Note that E0(b1 ; w) depends only on . By substituting q = t1t21t221 Nk1 =k (t22),
we get

                 !(b1 )Y1ssk (; b1 )E0(b1 ; w)db1

  It is easy to see that

                                      ! (q)k1 1(R1 ; k1 q)     1    s d d q

we get the proposition.
                                                                                                  Q.E.D.

                                                 BA1 =Bk

The last step is because Z2ssk (; b1 ) does not depend on u.
  By substituting q = t1Nk1 =k (t22), we get
      Z
                  !(b1 )Z2ssk (; b1 )E0(b1 ; w)db1

  Since k13 =  1, It is easy to see that

                                                              12
   Let
(3:12)        J1(; !) = # (!)(b (0) (0))
                            + %k1 2(!)(1 (R2 b ; !1 1; 2) 1(R2; !1 1 ; 2));
            J2(; !; s) = 1 (!)(k1 1 (R1b ; !2 1 ; s) k1 1(R1 ; !2; s)):
Then by (3.8) and Propositions (3.9), (3.11),     Z
   I (; !; w)  J1(; !)(w; ) +          p1               J (; !; s)k1 (s)(w; s)ds:
                                        2 1 Re(s)=r>1 2
   Therefore, by Wright's principle (see [7, p. 373] or x3.7 of [8] replacing k by k1),
J2(; !; s) is holomorphic at s = 1 and
                I (; !; w)  J1(; !)(w; ) + %k1 J2(; !; 1)(w; ):
This implies
           1(!)k1 1;( 1)(R1b ; !2 1 ; 1) = 1 (!)k1 1;( 1)(R1 ; !2; 1);
           J2(; !; 1) = 1(!)(k1 1;(0)(R1b ; !2 1 ; 1) k1 1;(0)(R1; !2 ; 1)):
Therefore,
(3:13) I 0(; !) = Vk1 2 #(!)(b (0) (0))
                        + 2 (!)(1 (R2 b ; !1 1; 2) 1 (R2; !1 ; 2))
                        + 1 (!)(k1 1;(0)(R1b ; !2 1 ; 1) k11;(0)(R1; !2 ; 1)):
   It is easy to see that
                         (0) = (0); c(0) =  8 b (0);
                         1(R2; !1 ; 2) =  21 (R2; !1 ; 2);
                         1(R2c; !1 1 ; 2) =  61 (R2b ; !1 1 ; 2):
   Since
                     k11 (R1; !2 ; s) =  1 3s k11(R1 ; !2; s);
                     k11 (R1c; !2 1 ; s) =  7+3sk11 (R1b ; !2 1 ; s);
we get
               k1 1;(0)(R1 ; !2; 1) =  4 k11;(0)(R1 ; !2; 1)
                                               3 4 log k11;( 1)(R1; !2 ; 1);
              k1 1;(0)(R1 c; !2 1; 1) =  4 k11;(0)(R1 b ; !2 1; 1)

Then Theorem (3.6) follows by integrating sI 0(; !) over s 2 [0; 1] using (3.13).
                                                                                     Q.E.D.
Remark (3.14) For a place v, let kv be the corresponding completion of k. If
 = 
v where v is a Schwartz{Bruhat function on Vkv and v is compactly
supported in Vkssv for a certain innite place v, k1 1;( 1)(R2 ; !2; 1) = 0. But if
M!  = ,
                   k1 1;( 1)(R2b ; !2 1 ; 1) = k11;( 1)(R2; !2 ; 1) = 0
also. Therefore, all the poles of the associated Dirichlet series for this prehomoge-
neous vector space are simple.
