                                                    Abstract. Let nn (C) be the algebra of strictly upper-triangular n × n matrices and
                                                    X2 = {u ∈ nn (C) : u2 = 0} the subset of matrices of nilpotent order 2. Let Bn (C) be
                                                    the group of invertible upper-triangular matrices acting on nn by conjugation. Let Bu be
                                                    the orbit of u ∈ X2 with respect to this action. Let S2n be the subset of involutions in the
                                                    symmetric group Sn . We define a new partial order on S2n which gives the combinatorial
                                                    description of the closure of Bu . We also construct an ideal I(Bu ) ⊂ S(n∗ ) whose variety
                                                    V(I(Bu )) equals Bu .
                                                       We apply these results to orbital varieties of nilpotent order 2 in sln (C) in order to
                                                    give a complete combinatorial description of the closure of such an orbital variety in
                                                    terms of Young tableaux. We also construct the ideal of definition of such an orbital
                                                    variety up to taking the radical.

                                             1.1. Let G = SLn (C) be the special linear group of degree n over field C. Let B = Bn (C)
                                             be the standard Borel subgroup of G, that is the subgroup of all invertible upper-triangular
                                             matrices.
                                                Take g = sln and let g = n ⊕ h ⊕ n− be its standard triangular decomposition where
                                             n = nn is a subalgebra of strictly upper-triangular matrices, h = hn is a subalgebra of
                                             diagonal matrices of trace zero and n− = n− n is a subalgebra of strictly lower-triangular
                                             matrices in sln .
                                               We identify n− with (n+ )∗ through the Killing form on g. For any Lie algebra a, let
                                             S(a) denote its symmetric algebra.
                                               For any u ∈ n let Ou := {AuA−1 | A ∈ G} be its (adjoint) G-orbit and Bu :=
                                             {BuB −1 | B ∈ B} to be its (adjoint) B-orbit.
                                                For any u ∈ n, its only characteristic value is 0. So, Ou is a nilpotent orbit and every
                                             nilpotent orbit is obtained in such a way. Also, the Jordan form of a nilpotent orbit is
                                             described by a partition of n. Obviously, Bu ⊂ Ou ∩ n. Let O be a nilpotent orbit and
                                             v ∈ n. We say that Bv is associated to O if Bv ⊂ O. It is obvious that Bv is associated to
                                             O if and only if Ov = O. As shown in [2] for n ≥ 6, the number of Bv orbits associated

to O can be infinite. However, the G orbits of nilpotent order 2 decompose into finitely
many B orbits and so are a nice exception.
   Let X2 be the set of elements of nilpotent order 2 in n, that is X2 := {u ∈ n | u2 = 0}
where u2 is defined by associative multiplication of matrices. Let Sn be the symmetric
group on n elements. Let S2n be the set of involutions in Sn , that is S2n := {σ ∈ Sn | σ 2 =
Id}. As shown in [12] there is a natural bijection between B-orbits in X2 and S2n .
   In this paper we define a new partial order on S2n which completely describes a B-orbit
closure for B-orbits in X2 via this bijection. The combinatorial description of this order
is natural and very simple. Moreover, for a given B-orbit B ⊂ X2 we construct (via
generators) an ideal I(B) ∈ S(n− ) whose variety V(I(B)) equals B and use it to prove
our main Theorem 3.5.
    In addition we apply these results to the study of orbital varieties in X2 .
   On the one hand, the ideas of N. Spaltenstein gave me the inspiration for the order
defined here. On the other hand, we apply the results on B-orbits to the study of orbital
varieties. So we would like to give a brief description of orbital varieties.


1.2. Orbital varieties derive from the works of N. Spaltenstein [17, 18], and R. Stein-
berg [19, 20] written during their studies of the unipotent variety of a complex semisimple
group G. Translation from the unipotent variety of G to the nilpotent cone of g = Lie(G),
gave the notion of an orbital variety. It is defined as follows.
   Consider the adjoint action of G on g. Fix some triangular decomposition g = n h n− .
                                                                                      L L
A G orbit O in g is called nilpotent if it consists of nilpotent elements, that is if O = G x
for some x ∈ n. The intersection O ∩ n is a Lagrangian subvariety of O. It is reducible in
general. Its irreducible components are called orbital varieties associated to O. Orbital
varieties play a key role in the study of primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra U(g).
They also play an important role in Springer’s Weyl group representations.
   The first role above can be detailed as follows. Since g is semisimple, we can identify
g∗ with g through the Killing form. This identification gives an adjoint orbit a symplectic
structure. Then, by [18], [19] and [6], an orbital variety U associated to a nilpotent
orbit is a Lagrangian subvariety. Following the orbit method one would like to attach an
irreducible representation of the enveloping algebra U(g) to U. This should be a simple
highest weight module. Combining the results of A. Joseph and T. A. Springer one obtains
a one to one correspondence between the set of primitive ideals of U(g) containing the
augmentation ideal of its centre (thus corresponding to integral weights) and the set of
orbital varieties in g corresponding to Lusztig’s special orbits (see for example [1]). The
picture is especially beautiful for g = sln . In this case, all orbits are special and by [10]
the associated variety of a simple highest (integral) weight module is irreducible. By [1]
and [6] in general orbital variety closures are the irreducible components of an associated
variety of a simple highest weight module. Whilst for g = sln orbital variety closures are

themselves associated varieties and therefore give a natural geometric understanding of
the classification of primitive ideals. This makes their study especially interesting.

1.3. There are two descriptions of orbital varieties. The first one, valid only for sln was
given by Spaltenstein. The second one is a general construction for any semisimple Lie
algebra. It was obtained by Steinberg. We will consider the first one in what follows.
Both descriptions give a very nice combinatorial characterization of orbital varieties in sln
in terms of Young tableaux. However, both descriptions are not very satisfactory from a
geometric point of view.
   The ultimate description of an orbital variety U would be via the ideal I(U) ⊂ S(n− )
of definition of U, that is a radical ideal I whose variety V(I) equals U. In [7, Lecture 7]
the general form that such an ideal should take is suggested. Let N be the generic matrix
of n− + 1d. Then I(U) should be generated by a1 , a2 , · · · , ak . Here ai = gr (mi ), where
mi are some minors of N and filtration is by degree. This suggestion derived from an
algorithm for Ann U (n− ) U based on the Enright functor [6, 8.4] together with calculations
in [2].
   Of course, the above does not tackle the difficult question as to which minors mi to
choose. However, in [9] the ideal of definition of orbital varieties of codimension 1 in
a nilradical was constructed. This is the simplest non-trivial case since such a variety
closure is a complete intersection, thus we had to find only one non-trivial generating
polynomial.
   As explained in 1.1, here we apply the results for B orbits in X2 , to orbital varieties
associated to nilpotent orbits of nilpotent order 2. We use the fact shown in [11, 4.13]
that an orbital variety U ⊂ X2 admits a dense B-orbit BU . Applying our results to BU
we obtain an ideal I(U) := I(BU ) whose variety V(I(U)) equals U. Then the ideal of
definition of U is the radical of I(U).

1.4. Another natural problem connected to studying orbital variety closures is their
description as a union of irreducible varieties each one lying in some nilpotent orbit. In
particular, one can ask whether an orbital variety closure consists of orbital varieties only
or it includes some other B stable varieties.
   If g 6= sln an orbital variety closure is not necessarily [15] a union of orbital varieties.
However, the construction only works outside sln . One can conjecture that in sln an orbital
variety closure is a union of orbital varieties. This conjecture holds for orbital varieties of
Richardson type as it is shown in [13]. As well it is supported by the computations for
all orbital varieties for n ≤ 6.
  In this paper we show in 4.5 that this conjecture holds for orbital varieties in X2 .
                                                           G
   Given orbital varieties U, W ∈ n we say that W ≥ U if W ⊂ U. In [14] we give
the combinatorial description of this order for orbital varieties in X2 in terms of Young
tableaux. Thus, the result in 4.5 completes the combinatorial description of an orbital

variety closure in X2 in terms of Young tableaux. Although an orbital variety in X2 has a
much simpler structure then an orbital variety in general even this relatively simple case
already demonstrates the complexity of the theory.

1.5. The ideas we use to study Bu are derived from Spaltenstein’s characterization of
orbital varieties in sln by Young tableaux. Let us recall it in short.
   A nilpotent orbit Ou is described by a partition giving the length of blocks in the
Jordan form of u. Suppose the Jordan form of u consists of k non-zero blocks. We order
blocks in non-increasing order and put λ∗i to be the length of i−th block. Then Ou is
defined by the partition λ∗ = (λ∗1 , . . . , λ∗k ). We can represent λ∗ graphically as a Young
diagram – an array of k rows each starting at the same place on the left, where the i-th
row contains λ∗i boxes.
   Since in this paper we consider only nilpotent elements with the Jordan blocks of
length not more than 2, it is more convenient for us to take the dual partition to λ∗ that
is λ = (λ1 , . . . , λm ) where λi = #{λ∗j ∈ λ∗ | λj ≥ i}. In these terms Ou is described
by Young diagram Dλ with m columns with j-th column containing λj boxes. We will
denote the corresponding orbit by Oλ .
    Recall that a Young tableau T associated to the Young diagram Dλ is obtained by
filling the boxes of Dλ with numbers 1, . . . , n so that the numbers increase in rows from
left to right and in columns from top to bottom. Given a Young tableau T associated to
Dλ its shape is defined to be λ and denoted as sh (T ). Given u ∈ n∩Oλ its Young diagram
is again defined to be λ and denoted as Dn (u), or simply D(u). Now consider canonical
projections π1,n−i : nn → nn−i acting on a matrix by deleting the last i columns and the last
i rows. Set Dn−1 (u) := D(π1,n−1 (u)), Dn−2(u) := D(π1,n−2 (u)), . . . , D1 (u) := D(π1,1 (u))
and φ(u) := (D1 (u), D2(u), . . . , Dn (u)). Put 1 into the unique box of D1 (u). For any
i : 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 note that Di+1 (u) differs from Di (u) by a single ”corner” box. Put i + 1
into this box. This gives a bijection from the set of the chains (D1 (u), D2(u), . . . , Dn (u))
to the set of standard Young tableaux T of shape Dn (u). In other words, we view a
standard Young tableau as a chain of Young diagrams. For u ∈ n put ϕ(u) := T if T
corresponds under this bijection to φ(u). Set νT := {u ∈ n | ϕ(u) = T }.
   By Spaltenstein [17] orbital varieties associated to Oλ are parameterized by standard
Young tableaux of shape λ as follows. Let {Ti } be the set of Young tableaux of shape λ.
Set UTi := ν Ti ∩ Oλ . Then {UTi } is the set of orbital varieties associated to Oλ .

1.6. We would like to push Spaltenstein’s construction a little bit further. In a sim-
ilar way define projections πi,n : n → nhi,ni (cf. 2.3) acting on a matrix by deleting
the first i − 1 rows and the first i − 1 columns. Set D i (u) := D(πn−i+1,n (u)) and
θ(u) := (D 1 (u), . . . , D n (u)). Put n into the unique box of D 1 (u). Again, D i+1 (u) dif-
fers from D i (u) by a single ”corner” box. Insert n − i + 1 into the left hand corner by
inverting “jeu de taquin” (cf. [16]). This gives a second bijection from the set of chains
(D 1 (u), D 2(u), . . . , D n (u)) to the set of standard Young tableaux T of shape D n (u). In
                                      B-ORBITS OF ORDER 2                                          5




other words, we again view a standard Young tableau as a chain of Young diagrams.
For u ∈ n put ϑ(u) := T if T corresponds under this bijection to θ(u). Again, set
ν T := {u ∈ n | ϑ(u) = T }. By symmetry about the anti-diagonal it follows that any
orbital variety U associated to Oλ is obtained as U = ν T ∩ Oλ . Moreover, it is immediate
that ν T ∩ Oλ = UT .
  On the other hand, ϑ(u) can
                           ` differ from ϕ(u). For standard tableaux T, S of shape λ put
ν = (νT ∩ν ). Then νT =
 S
 T
          S
                              (νT ∩ν ). Obviously, νTS ⊂ UT ∩US . Thus, dim νTS < dim UT
                                     S

                             sh S=λ
whenever S 6= T. Hence, νTT is dense in UT .
   For any i, j : 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n using jeu de taquin to delete 1, . . . , i − 1 from a tableau
T and deleting boxes containing n, n − 1, . . . , j + 1 from T we define πi,j (T ) – a tableau
with j − i + 1 boxes filled in with i, . . . , j. Set Di,j (T ) := sh (πi,j (T )). In that way we can
consider each Young tableau as a double chain through
                                  D1,1 (T ) D1,2 (T ) . . . D1,n (T )
                                                                            
                                                D2,2 (T ) . . . D2,n (T ) 
                        T ←→                               ..       ..      
                                                              .      .      
                                                                  Dn,n (T )
Correspondingly, we can define the projection πi,j : nn → nj−i+1 acting on a matrix by
deleting the first i − 1 rows and the first i − 1 columns and the last n − j rows and the
last n − j columns. Set
                              νT′ = {u ∈ n | D(πi,j (u)) = Di,j (T )}
Obviously, νT′ ⊂ νTT . Moreover, using Steinberg construction one gets that UT = νT′ ∩ Oλ .
This construction provides us the power rank conditions introduced in [21]. In turn these
conditions define an ideal IT ⊂ S(n− ) such that its variety V(IT ) contains U T . However,
in general for n ≥ 6 this ideal is far away from being an ideal of definition of UT since
the variety of the ideal is not irreducible and can include even another orbital variety
associated to the same nilpotent orbit (cf., for example, [21]).

1.7. Now we can explain the way we construct I(B) for B ⊂ X2 . Note that adjoint B
                                                         ′
action is compatible projection, that is πi,j (Bu ) = Bπi,j (u) where Bu′ ′ is a Bj−i+1−orbit
of u′ ∈ nj−i+1 . Thus, we can use the same construction of double chains not only for
orbital varieties but for B-orbits as well. Note that a double chain defined by some Young
tableau corresponds in general to some set of B-orbits, however, a double chain defined
by a B-orbit will not correspond in general to a standard Young tableau. This double
chain can be described by power rank conditions exactly in the same way as in the case
of an orbital variety. Thus, as in the case of orbital varieties we can construct an ideal
I(B) ⊂ S(n− ) as it is explained in detail in 2.8, 2.9. Again, the variety V(I(B)) always
contains B but in general it contains B−orbits not from B as well (cf. 2.10).
  However, for B ⊂ X 2 the variety V(I(B)) = B. This is the main technical result of the
paper.

1.8. In this paper we do not touch upon two very important problems connected to our
results. The first problem is whether the ideals we construct are ideals of definition. To
show this we have to show that they are radical ideals. This is a complex question. For
some cases we can answer positively using technique introduced in [4], in particular if
B is associated to the minimal (non-zero) orbit. Indeed, for the nilpotent orbit of the
smallest non-zero dimension, the ideal constructed in 2.9 for an orbital variety associated
to it, coincides with the ideal of definiton for such orbital varieties given in [3]. These
computations give us a hope that our ideals are ideals of definition. However, I am far
away from complete answer to this question.
   The second problem is closely connected to the first one. It is the construction of a
strong quantization of orbital varieties in X2 . Again, as it is shown in [8] the problem is
far from being easy even for the minimal nilpotent orbit.
   Another question, that we do not consider here, which however could be solved using
our construction is the description of intersections of orbital varieties of nilpotent order
2.


1.9. The body of the paper consists of three sections. In section 2 we explain all the
background essential in the subsequent analysis to make the paper self-contained. In
section 3 we formulate and prove the results on B-orbit closures in X2 . Finally, in section
4 we explain the results connected to orbital varieties of nilpotent order 2 and apply the
results of section 3 to complete the combinatorial description of their closures.
   In the end one can find the index of notation in which symbols appearing frequently
are given with the subsection where they are defined. We hope that this will help the
reader to find his way through the paper.

                   2. Geometric and Combinatorial Preliminaries

2.1. Let P (n) denote the set of partitions of n. For all λ := {λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λk >
0} ∈ P (n) we define the Young diagram Dλ to be the array of k columns of boxes each
starting at the first row with the i-th column containing λi boxes. Let Dn denote the set
of all Young diagrams with n boxes.
    Recall as well that λ∗ denotes the dual partition.

   For example, take λ = (4, 2, 2). Then λ∗ = (3, 3, 1, 1) and



                                        Dλ =




2.2. It is convenient to replace sln by gln . This makes no difference to the nilpotent cone
N whilst the adjoint action (conjugation) by G = GLn on N factors to SLn . Let B be
the (Borel) subgroup of upper-triangular matrices in G. Let b = Lie (B) = n ⊕ h be the
corresponding subalgebra of gln .
  Recall the Ou defined in 1.1 and the Oλ defined in 1.5. For u ∈ n ∩ Oλ set sh (u) := λ
and sh (Ou ) := sh (u).
   In particular, O(l,k) denotes the nilpotent orbit with k Jordan blocks of length 2 and
l − k Jordan blocks of length 1.

projections πi,j : B → Bhi,ji and πi,j : n → nhi,ji which we           mentioned in 1.6. For the
matrix u = (us,t)ns,t=1 where u ∈ n or u ∈ B one has

  Recall 1.6. For u ∈ n put Di,j (u) := sh (πi,j (u)). Let Du be the resulting “matrix” of
projections shapes, that is
                                       (
                                         0,         if i ≥ j;

                                         Di,j (u) otherwise
Let Bu denote the B orbit of u.
   For any u ∈ n and A ∈ B one has πi,j (AuA−1 ) = πi,j (A)πi,j (u)πi,j (A)−1 so that
sh (πi,j (AuA−1 )) = sh (πi,j (u)) and DBu := Du is well defined. By the discussion in 1.6
one sees that Di,j−1 (u) (as well as Di+1,j ) is obtained from Di,j (u) just by decreasing one
of the entries of Di,j by 1, that is if Di,j (u) = (λ1 , . . . , λk ), where λk > 0, then there exists
r : 1 ≤ r ≤ k such that Di,j−1(u) = (λ1 , . . . , λr − 1, . . . , λk ).

2.4. Let W be Weyl group of (g, h). For α ∈ R+ let sα ∈ W be the corresponding
reflection. For αi ∈ Π set si := sαi . We identify W with Sn by taking si to be the
elementary permutation interchanging i, i + 1.
   Set Shi,ji := hsαk : i ≤ k < j i which we call a parabolic subgroup of W = Sn .
Set Dhi,ji := {w ∈ Sn | w(αk ) ∈ R+ ∀i ≤ k < j}. Then the multiplication map gives a
bijection Shi,ji × Dhi,ji ≃ Sn . Let πi,j : Sn → Shi,ji be the projection onto the first factor.

2.5. Let us define the decomposition of X2 into B−orbits.
   Recall that S2n denotes the subset of involutions in Sn . Write σ ∈ S2n as a product of
disjoint cycles of length 2. Order entries inside a given cycle to be increasing. Unless
mentioned to the contrary (in section 4) we order the cycles so that the first entries
increase. Thus, σ = (i1 , j1 )(i2 , j2 ) . . . (ik , jk ) where is < js for any 1 ≤ s ≤ k and is < is+1
for any 1 ≤ s < k.

   For σ = (i1 , j1 )(i2 , j2 ) . . . (ik , jk ) we construct Nσ ∈ n as follows
                                       (
                                         1, if i = is , j = js for some 1 ≤ s ≤ k :

                                         0, otherwise.

  Note that Nσ is the upper-triangular part of the permutation matrix Mσ . Set Bσ :=
BNσ . By [12, 2.2] one has
                       `
Proposition. X2 =          Bσ .
                        σ∈S2n


    This finiteness property is particular for X2 . For n ≥ 6 and Xk = {X ∈ n | X k = 0}
where k ≥ 3 the number of B orbits in Xk is infinite in general for any infinite field as it
is shown in [2].

2.6. Given σ = (i1 , j1 )(i2 , j2 ) . . . (ik , jk ) ∈ S2n , set l(σ) := k and let Oσ := ONσ be the G
orbit of Nσ .
Lemma. For σ ∈ S2n such that l(σ) = k one has sh (Oσ ) = (n − k, k).

Proof.
Indeed, Nσ ∈ X2 and its rank is k. Thus, its Jordan form contains k blocks of length 2
and n − k blocks of length 1.
                                                                                                 

2.7. Given σ = (i1 , j1 )(i2 , j2 ) . . . (ik , jk ) ordered as in 2.5. For s : 2 ≤ s ≤ k set
                 rs := r(is , js ) := #{jp : p < s, jp < js } + #{jp : jp < is }.
For example, take σ = (1, 6)(3, 4)(5, 7). Then l(σ) = 3 and r2 = 0, r3 = 2 + 1 = 3.
   By [12, 3.1] one has

We call these the power rank conditions. Each power rank condition can be translated into
polynomials in S(g∗ ) as follows. Let us identify S(g∗ ) with S(g) through the coordinate
functions                                   (
                                             1, if (s, r) = (i, j),
                             xj,i (er,s ) =                                           (∗)
                                             0, otherwise.
Setting xi,j = ej,i identifies g∗ with g. Now, Rank ui ≤ j if and only if every minor of order

Let {Pt }t=1 be the set of all minors of order j of N i . Then O λ is the zero variety of

2.9. Identify S(n∗ ) with S(n− ) through 2.8 (∗). Take u ∈ n and put B := Bu . Let us
apply 2.8 to B.
   Let DB be the matrix defined in 2.3. From DB define an ideal I(B) (or simply I) of
S(n− ) as follows. Suppose (DB )i,j = (λ1 (i, j), . . . , λk (i, j)). For any u ∈ B one has by
definition of DB that the power rank conditions on πi,j (u) (cf. [21]) are as follows:
Rank (πi,j (u)) = j − i + 1 − λ1 (i, j), Rank ((πi,j (u))2 ) = j − i + 1 − λ1 (i, j) − λ2 (i, j), . . .

                    Rank ((πi,j (u))k−1) = λk (i, j),       Rank ((πi,j (u))k ) = 0.                (∗)

In turn, these power rank conditions translate to polynomials in S(n ) by 2.8.
   Note that if u ∈ X2 then the power rank conditions provide us polynomials of 2 types:
quadratic polynomials given by the conditions πi,j (u2 ) = 0 and polynomials of order
Rank (πi,j (u)) + 1 – these are the minors of order Rank (πi,j (u)) + 1 of matrix πi,j (u) (cf.
3.4 for the details).
     Note that for any u ∈ n one has
      (i) πi,j (ur ) = (πi,j (u))r for any i, j : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and r ∈ N.
     (ii) Rank (πi,j (u)) ≤ Rank (πi,j−1(u)) + 1 and Rank (πi,j (u)) ≤ Rank (πi+1,j (u)) + 1 for
          any possible i, j.

Di+1,i+r . For some l ∈ N we can write Di,i+r = (λ1 , . . . , λl + 1, . . .). Then the polynomials
generated by power rank conditions coming from Di,i+r for powers less than l belong to
the ideal Ir−1 . In particular,
    (i) if Di,i+r = (λ1 , . . . , λk , 1) then I(i,i+r) (B) ⊂ Ir−1 (B);

In our notation we get I1 (B) = hP1 = x3,2 , P2 = x4,3 , P3 = x5,4 i. As for the entries of
the second set one has Di,i+2 = (2, 1) = (Di+1,i+2 , 1) for all i : 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, thus, the
second set does not add new generating polynomials, so that I2 (B) = I1 (B). Again, since
D1,4 = (2, 1, 1) = (D1,3 , 1) then by our lemma we do not get new generating polynomials

from this condition. The only possible new generating polynomial produced by the third
set obtains from D2,5 = (2, 2) and it comes from Rank (π2,5 (N 2 )) = 0. This gives us
P3 = x5,3 x3,2 + x5,4 x4,2 however P3 = P1 x5,3 + x4,2 P3 so that it is in I1 (B). Finally,
D1,5 = (2, 2, 1) = (D2,5 , 1) so that again by our lemma we do not get new generating
polynomials. Thus, I(B) = I1 (B) = hx3,2 , x4,3 , x5,4 i.

2.10. Given two B−orbits B, B′ applying the result of Gerstenhaber we get I(B) ⊂ I(B′ )
if and only if for any i < j one has (DB )i,j ≤ (DB′ )i,j .
   Obviously, B ⊂ V(I(B)). However, in general V(I(B)) ) B. Power rank conditions are
too weak even to separate two B-orbits of the same dimension lying in the same nilpotent
orbit O. For example, consider

2.11. From the previous subsections we see that we can define two partial orders on B
orbits in n. The first one is defined by inclusion of B orbit closures and the second one by
inverse inclusion of the ideals generated by power rank conditions defined by a B orbit.
We call the first order geometric and the second order algebraic. From 2.10 we see that
in general the algebraic order is a proper extension of the geometric order.
  Now consider just B orbits of nilpotent order 2 in n. They are in bijection with S2n so
both these orders induce partial orders on S2n .
                                        B-ORBITS OF ORDER 2                                              13




   The geometric order on S2n is induced by B orbit closures inclusion, that is for σ, σ ′ ∈ S2n
           G
we set σ ′ ≤ σ if Bσ′ ⊂ Bσ .
   The algebraic order on S2n is induced by inverse inclusions of I(Bσ ), that is for σ, σ ′ ∈ S2n
           A
we set σ ′ ≤ σ if I(Bσ′ ) ⊃ I(Bσ ) (or equivalently if V(I(Bσ′ )) ⊂ V(I(Bσ ))).
  We show in what follows that on S2n the geometric and the algebraic orders coincide
and we have the precise combinatorial description of this order.

2.12. Since πi,j is a projection it is continuous, one has
Lemma. For B-orbit B and any i, j : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n one has πi,j (B) ⊆ πi,j (B). In
particular, if B′ ⊂ B then πi,j (B′ ) ⊂ πi,j (B).

2.13. We need also the following notation for σ ∈ S2n . We write (i, j) ∈ σ if it is one of
the cycles of σ.
    We write σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ) in increasing order as described in 2.5. Set I(σ) :=
{is }ks=1 and J(σ) := {js }ks=1 .
    For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n set Si,j to be the set of indices Si,j (σ) := {s : i ≤ is ≤ j and i ≤
js ≤ j}. For example, take σ = (1, 8)(2, 5)(3, 4)(6, 7) ∈ S8 . Then S2,6 (σ) = {2, 3}. One has
πi,j (σ) = (is1 , js1 ) . . . (isq , jsq ), where Si,j = {sp }qp=1 . In our example π2,6 (σ) = (2, 5)(3, 4).

                                     3. B-orbit closures in X2

3.1. For a matrix u ∈ n recall the notion Bu from 1.1 and Du , DBu from 2.3. For
i, j : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n set Ri,j (u) = Rank πi,j (u) and let Ru denote the corresponding
(upper-triangular) matrix of ranks:
                                        (
                                         0,        if i ≥ j;
                            (Ru )i,j :=
                                         Ri,j (u), otherwise.
Obviously, for any v ∈ Bu one has Rv = Ru so that we may write RBu := Ru exactly as
we have defined DBu .
   Note that Ru can be read off from Du . Indeed, denote Di,j (u) := (λ1i,j (u), λ2i,j (u), . . .)
then Ri,j (u) = j + 1 − i − λ1i,j (u). In general, the information encoded in Du is much
reacher than the information encoded in Ru . However, in the case of u ∈ X2 these two
matrices give exactly the same information since Di,j (u) = (j + 1 − i − Ri,j (u), Ri,j (u)).
  Adding one row or one column to a matrix can at most increase its rank by one, so for
any u ∈ n the matrix Ru has the following properties
     (i) (Ru )i,j = 0 if i ≥ j
    (ii) For i < j one has (Ru )i+1,j ≤ (Ru )i,j ≤ (Ru )i+1,j + 1 and (Ru )i,j−1 ≤ (Ru )i,j ≤
         (Ru )i,j−1 + 1.
14                                      ANNA MELNIKOV




By 2.5 for any u ∈ X2 there exist a unique σ ∈ S2n such that Bu = Bσ . We get Ru = RNσ
which we denote by Rσ := RNσ = RBσ . By the definition of Nσ in each row and each
column there is not more than one non-zero entry, thus, (Rσ )i,j is simply the number of
ones in the matrix πi,j (Nσ ).

In particular, just by the form of Nσ one has that (Nσ )i,j = 1 implies

                                                                                          (∗)
This implies as well that (Nσ )k,i = (Nσ )j,k = 0 for any k so that
      (Rσ )k,i = (Rσ )k,i−1   and     (Rσ )j,k = (Rσ )j+1,k     for any k : 1 ≤ k ≤ n.       (∗∗)
Moreover, we get
Lemma. Let σ ∈ S2n then (Rσ )i,j = (Rσ )i+1,j + 1 = (Rσ )i,j−1 + 1 = (Rσ )i+1,j−1 + 1 if and
only if (i, j) ∈ σ.

Proof.
If (i, j) ∈ σ then (Nσ )i,j = 1. This implies that (Rσ )i,j = (Rσ )i+1,j + 1 = (Rσ )i,j−1 + 1.
Also (Nσ )i,j = 1 implies (Nσ )i,k = (Nσ )t,j = 0 for all k 6= j and t 6= i. Hence, in particular,
(Rσ )i+1,j = (Rσ )i,j−1 = (Rσ )i+1,j−1 .
   On the other hand, assume that (Rσ )i+1,j = (Rσ )i,j−1 = (Rσ )i+1,j−1 . This means by the
form of N that Ni,k = Nt,j = 0 for any k : 1 ≤ k ≤ j − 1 and for any t : i + 1 ≤ t ≤ n.
Then (Rσ )i,j = (Rσ )i+1,j + 1 forces Ni,j = 1.

   Thus, by (∗), (∗∗) and the lemma, any R = Rσ for σ ∈ S2n has the following additional
property
     (iii) If Ri,j = Ri+1,j + 1 = Ri,j−1 + 1 = Ri+1,j−1 + 1 then
            (a) Ri,k = Ri+1,k for any k < j and Ri,k = Ri+1,k + 1 for any k ≥ j;

3.2. Let us study the structure of Rσ more explicitly.
Lemma. Let R = Rσ for some σ ∈ S2n . For any i, j : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n only one of the
following is possible
    (i)   Ri,j   = Ri+1,j−1 and in that case Ri+1,j = Ri,j−1 = Ri,j ;
   (ii)   Ri,j   = Ri+1,j−1 + 2 and in that case Ri+1,j = Ri,j−1 = Ri+1,j−1 + 1;
  (iii)   Ri,j   = Ri+1,j−1 + 1 and Ri+1,j = Ri,j−1 = Ri+1,j−1;
  (iv)    Ri,j   = Ri+1,j−1 + 1 and Ri,j−1 = Ri+1,j−1 + 1, Ri+1,j = Ri,j ;
   (v)    Ri,j   = Ri+1,j−1 + 1 and Ri+1,j = Ri+1,j−1 + 1, Ri,j−1 = Ri,j .
In each of the above cases R can be presented graphically as follows:
                         ··· p p                 ··· p+1 p+2
                     (i) · · · p  p         (ii) · ·
                                                 ·       p    p+1
                               .. ..                     ..      ..
                                . .                       .       .
                   ··· p p+1                ··· p p+1           ··· p+1 p+1
             (iii) · · · p  p ;        (iv) · · · p p + 1 , (v) · · · p  p
                         .. ..                    ..  ..              .. ..

Proof.
Consider some Nσ . The first case is simply equivalent to Nk,j = Ni,s = 0 for any k ≥ i
and any s ≤ j. The second case is equivalent to the existence of k > i and of s < j
such that Nk,j = Ni,s = 1. Since Ri,j is the number of ones in the submatrix N(i,j) it is
obvious that Ri,j = Ri+1,j−1 + 2 in that case. The third case occurs if Ni,j = 1 and, thus,
Nk,j = Ni,s = 0 for any k > i and any s < j so that Ri+1,j = Ri,j−1 = Ri+1,j−1 . The fourth
case occurs if Ni,s = 0 for all s ≤ j and Nk,j = 1 for some k > i. Finally, the fifth case
occurs if Nk,j = 0 for all k ≥ i and Ni,s = 1 for some s < j.
                                                                                            

3.3. Let R2n ⊂ Mn denote a subset of matrices satisfying properties (i)-(iii) of 3.1.
Proposition. R2n = {RNσ }σ∈S2n .

Proof.
We have seen already that Rσ ∈ R2n for all σ ∈ S2n . On the other hand, consider some
R ∈ R2n and let N be the matrix defined by
                  (
                    1, if Ri,j = Ri+1,j + 1 = Ri,j−1 + 1 = Ri+1,j−1 + 1; (∗)
           Ni,j =
                    0, otherwise.
By property (i) Ni,j = 0 for any i, j : i ≥ j. Note that if Ni,j = 1 then Ni,k = 0 for any
k 6= j. Indeed, Ri,k = Ri+1,k for k < j and Ri,k−1 = Ri+1,k−1 + 1 for k > j by property
iii(a) so that conditions (∗) are not satisfied for any (i, k) for which k 6= j. Exactly in the
16                                             ANNA MELNIKOV




same way we get by iii(b) that Nk,j = 0 for any k 6= i. Again, by iii(c) no Nj,k and Nk,i can
satisfy conditions (∗), thus, Nj,k = Nk,i = 0. Hence, N = Nσ for σ defined by non-zero
entries of N. It remains to show that Rσ = R. This is a straightforward corollary of (i)
and (ii) of 3.1.
                                                                                                          

3.4. Let I2 ⊂ S(n− ) be the ideal generated by I2 = h                    k=j+1 xi,k xk,j ij=1,i=j+1 .   Then
V(I2 ) = X2 .
    Given σ ∈ S2n let Bσ be the corresponding B orbit in X2 . DBσ (cf. 2.3) defines as in 2.9
the ideal I(Bσ ) or simply I(σ) of S(n− ). which has two types of generating polynomials.
The polynomials of the first type are quadratic (homogeneous) polynomials generating
I2 since I2 ⊂ I(σ). The generating polynomials of the second type in Iσ are determined
by Rank (πi,j (Nσ )) that is by (Rσ )i,j . We translate this fact into the set of minors of
πi,j (N) of size (Rσ )i,j + 1. These polynomials are homogeneous of degree (Rσ )i,j + 1.
Let us denote the ideal generated by the polynomials of the second type by I1 (σ). Put
IRσ := Iσ := I2 + I1 (σ). Set VRσ := Vσ := V(Iσ ).
   Note that πi,j (Nσ ) provides new polynomials generating I1 (σ) compared to those ob-
tained from πi+1,j (Nσ ) and πi,j−1(Nσ ) only in the situation when (Rσ )i,j = (Rσ )i+1,j−1.
Indeed, by lemma 2.9(ii) if (Rσ )i,j = (Rσ )i+1,j−1 + 1 then all the new generating polyno-
mials obtained from (Rσ )i,j are in I2 .

1 ≤ i, j ≤ n one has Ri,j ≤ Ri,j  . Let us define the corresponding partial order on S2n . For
σ, σ ′ ∈ S2n we put σ ≤ σ ′ if Rσ ≤ Rσ′ .

Theorem. For any σ ∈ S2n one has

   To do this we study the inclusion relation on {Iσ }σ∈S2n and show that it coincides with
inverse inclusion relation on {Bσ }σ∈S2n . Then the result obtains as a corollary.

3.6. All the power rank conditions in the case of X2 are defined just by ranks of the
minors of the lower-triangular matrix of indeterminants (and the common conditions
coming from X 2 = 0). Hence σ ≤ σ ′ (or Rσ ≤ Rσ′ ) ⇐⇒ Iσ ⊃ Iσ′ ⇐⇒ Vσ ⊂ Vσ′ .
Lemma. Bσ′ ⊂ Bσ implies Vσ′ ⊂ Vσ .

Proof.
The proof is by induction on n. It holds trivially for n = 2. Assume it holds for n − 1.
  Assume Bσ′ ⊂ B σ for σ ′ , σ ∈ S2n .
      (i) Since Bσ′ ⊂ Bσ implies Oσ′ ⊂ Oσ , thus, by Gerstenhaber’s result (cf. 2.8),
          Rank Nσ′ ≤ Rank Nσ , that is, (Rσ′ )1,n ≤ (Rσ )1,n .

      (ii) By 2.12 this implies as well that π1,n−1 (Bσ′ ) ⊂ π1,n−1 (Bσ ). By the induction as-
           sumption this provides Rπ1,n−1 (σ′ ) ≤ Rπ1,n−1 (σ) .
     (iii) Exactly in the same way we get π2,n (Bσ′ ) ⊂ π2,n (Bσ ) and, thus, Rπ2,n (σ′ ) ≤ Rπ2,n (σ) .

By (ii) and (iii) we get (Rσ′ )i,j ≤ (Rσ )i,j for any (i, j) 6= (1, n) and by (i) one has
(Rσ′ )1,n ≤ (Rσ )1,n . Thus, Rσ′ ≤ Rσ .

      (i) D1 (σ) is the set of all σ ′ such that
          (a) σ ′ < σ;
          (b) l(σ ′ ) = l(σ);
          (c) for any σ ′′ such that σ ≥ σ ′′ ≥ σ ′ one has either σ ′′ = σ or σ ′′ = σ ′ .
     (ii) D2 (σ) is the set of all σ ′ such that
          (a) σ ′ < σ;
          (b) l(σ ′ ) < l(σ);
          (c) for any σ ′′ such that l(σ ′′ ) < l(σ) and σ > σ ′′ ≥ σ ′ one has σ ′′ = σ ′ .
   For any σ ′ ∈ D1 (σ) one has Oσ′ = Oσ . Moreover, D1 (σ) is the set of the maximal
elements of length l(σ) which are smaller than σ with respect to the order defined in 3.5.
   For every σ ′ ∈ D2 (σ) one has Oσ′ ( Oσ . Moreover D2 (σ) is the set of the maximal
elements of length less than l(σ) which are smaller than σ with respect to the order defined
in 3.5.
   We begin with the construction of D2 (σ). Then we construct D1 (σ). Both constructions
are straightforward but the proofs are rather long.
   Recall from 2.5 that we write σ = (i1 , j1 )(i2 , j2 ) . . . (ik , jk ) where is < js for any s :
1 ≤ s ≤ k and is < is+1 for any s : 1 ≤ s < k. Recall notation (i, j) ∈ σ, I(σ) and J(σ)
from 2.13. Set
                   M(σ) := {s : s = 1 or s > 1 and js > max{j1 , . . . js−1 }}.
The following lemma is straightforward.
Lemma. If s ∈ M(σ) then for any (i, j) ∈ σ such that (i, j) 6= (is , js ) one has that either
i > is or j < js . In particular, fix m := max{s ∈ M(σ)} then jm = max{j ∈ J(σ)}.

3.8. For any s : 1 ≤ s ≤ k let σs− := (i1 , j1 ) . . . (is−1 , js−1 )(is+1 , js+1 ) . . . be the involution
obtained by omitting (is , js ). From the definition of ≤ one has σs− < σ. Our aim is to show
that D2 (σ) = {σs− | s ∈ M(σ)}. We will first prove the
Lemma. D2 (σ) ⊇ {σs− | s ∈ M(σ)}.

Proof.
Consider σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ) ∈ S2n .
   Assume (i1 , j1 ) = (1, n). Then D2 (σ) = {σ1− = (i2 , j2 ) . . . (ik , jk )} since for any (i, j) 6=
(1, n) one has (Rσ )i,j = (Rσ1− )i,j and (Rσ1− )1,n = (Rσ )1,n − 1.
   Now assume (i1 , j1 ) 6= (1, n). If s ∈ M(σ) then
                                    (
                                      (Rσ )p,q − 1, if p ≤ is and q ≥ js ;
                     (Rσs− )p,q =
                                      (Rσ )p,q ,    otherwise.

Assume that there exists σ ′ such that l(σ ′ ) < k and Rσ > Rσ′ ≥ Rσs− . Since (Rσs− )p,q =
(Rσ )p,q whenever p > is or q < js we obtain (Rσ′ )p,q = (Rσs− )p,q = (Rσ )p,q whenever p > is
or q < js .
   In particular, for any (i, j) ∈ σs− we have either i > is or j < js by lemma 3.7. Hence,
(Rσ′ )p,q = (Rσs− )p,q = (Rσ )p,q for (p, q) ∈ {(i+1, j −1), (i, j −1), (i+1, j), (i, j)}. Further,
since (Nσ )i,j = 1 lemma 3.1 gives (Rσ )i,j = (Rσ )i+1,j−1 + 1 = (Rσ )i,j−1 + 1 = (Rσ )i+1,j + 1.
Thus, also (Rσ′ )i,j = (Rσ′ )i+1,j−1 + 1 = (Rσ′ )i,j−1 + 1 = (Rσ′ )i+1,j + 1, which by lemma 3.1
gives (i, j) ∈ σ ′ whenever (i, j) ∈ σs− . Finally, since l(σ ′ ) ≤ k − 1 we obtain σ ′ = σs− .
                                                                                                               

3.9.
Proposition. D2 (σ) = {σs− | s ∈ M(σ)}.

Proof.
By lemma 3.8 it remains to show that for any σ ′ such that σ ′ < σ and l(σ ′ ) < l(σ) there
exists s ∈ M(σ) such that σ ′ ≤ σs− .
    The proof is by induction on n. It is trivially true for σ ∈ S22 . Assume it is true for
σ ∈ S2n−1 . Take σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ) ∈ S2n and σ ′ = (i′1 , j1′ ) . . . (i′k′ , jk′ ′ ) ∈ S2n such that
σ ′ < σ and k ′ < k. In the induction step we can consider recursion either to π1,n−1 or to
π2,n . This involves the interplay between all possible (Rσ′ )i,j where i = 1, 2, j = n − 1, n.
The argument is broken into the five claims below. We formulate the assumptions of each
claim both in terms of J(σ ′ ), J(σ) (resp. I(σ ′ ), I(σ)) and in terms of (Rσ′ )1,n−1 , (Rσ )1,n−1
(resp. (Rσ′ )2,n , (Rσ )2,n ) for greater clarity. The conclusion of each claim is the existence
of s ∈ M(σ) such that σ ′ ≤ σs− .
Claim 1. Assume that n 6∈ J(σ ′ ), J(σ) (resp. 1 6∈ I(σ ′ ), I(σ)). This is equivalent to
(Rσ′ )1,n−1 = (Rσ′ )1,n and (Rσ )1,n−1 = (Rσ )1,n (resp. (Rσ′ )2,n = (Rσ′ )1,n and (Rσ )2,n =
(Rσ )1,n .) Then there exists s ∈ M(σ) such that σ ′ ≤ σs− .

Proof.

By symmetry about the anti-diagonal it is enough to consider the case n 6∈ J(σ ′ ), J(σ) that
is (Rσ′ )1,n−1 = (Rσ′ )1,n = k ′ and (Rσ )1,n−1 = (Rσ )1,n = k. In that case π1,n−1 (σ ′ ) = σ ′ and
π1,n−1 (σ) = σ. By the induction hypothesis there exists s ∈ M(σ) such that σ > σs− ≥ σ ′ .
Considering σ, σs− and σ ′ as elements of S2n we get the corresponding rank matrices by
adding an n−th row with zero entries and an n−th column with entries equal to those in
the (n − 1)-th column. Thus, σ ′ ≤ σs− as elements of S2n .
                                                                                                
Claim 2. Assume that n 6∈ J(σ ′ ) and n ∈ J(σ) (resp. 1 6∈ I(σ ′ ) and 1 ∈ I(σ)). This is
equivalent to (Rσ′ )1,n−1 = (Rσ′ )1,n (resp. (Rσ′ )2,n = (Rσ′ )1,n ) and (Rσ )1,n−1 = (Rσ )1,n − 1
(resp. (Rσ )2,n = (Rσ )1,n − 1). Then σ ′ ≤ σm−
                                                 where m = max{s ∈ M(σ)} (resp.σ ′ ≤ σ1− ).

Proof.
Again, by symmetry about the anti-diagonal it is enough to consider the case (Rσ′ )1,n−1 =
(Rσ′ )1,n and (Rσ )1,n−1 = (Rσ )1,n − 1. In that case jm = n. Let us show that σ ′ ≤ σm          −
                                                                                                   .
Indeed, (Rσm  − )i,j = (Rσ )i,j whenever j < n so that (Rσ ′ )i,j ≤ (R − )i,j for such pairs. Since
                                                                      σm
n 6∈ J(σ ′ ) one has (Rσ′ )i,n = (Rσ′ )i,n−1 ≤ (Rσm                                        ′
                                                  − )i,n−1 = (R − )i,n for any i. Thus σ ≤ σ .
                                                                  σm
                                                                                                −
                                                                                                m

  We are left with the case 1 ∈ I(σ ′ ) and n ∈ J(σ ′ ). We have two subcases which we
consider in three claims below.
Claim 3. Assume that (1, n) ∈ σ ′ . This is equivalent to (Rσ′ )2,n−1 = (Rσ′ )1,n−1 =
(Rσ′ )2,n = k ′ − 1. Then there exists s ∈ M(σ) such that σ ′ < σs− .

Proof.

     If 1 ∈ I(σ) then σ ′ ≤ σ1− since
       (i) (Rσ1− )i,j = (Rσ )i,j ≥ (Rσ′ )i,j whenever i > 1;
      (ii) (Rσ′ )1,j = (Rσ′ )2,j ≤ (Rσ )2,j = (Rσ1− )1,j whenever j < n;
     (iii) (Rσ′ )1,n = k ′ ≤ k − 1 = (Rσ1− )1,n ;

   If 1 6∈ I(σ) then π2,n (σ) = σ and π2,n (σ ′ ) = (σ ′ )−
                                                          1 . By the induction hypothesis there
                                    ′ −
                              −
exists s ∈ M(σ) such that σs ≥ (σ )1 . Let us show that σs− ≥ σ ′ . Indeed,
       (i) (Rσs− )i,j ≥ (R(σ′ )−1 ) = (Rσ′ )i,j whenever i > 1;
      (ii) (Rσ′ )1,j = (Rσ′ )2,j ≤ (Rσs− )2,j = (Rσs− )1,j whenever j < n;
     (iii) (Rσ′ )1,n = k ′ ≤ k − 1 = (Rσs− )1,n ;

  Note that in both cases the inequality is strict since in both cases (Rσs− )2,n = k − 1 >
 ′
k − 1 = (Rσ′ )2,n .
                                                                                                

   The remaining case is when 1 ∈ I(σ ′ ) and n ∈ J(σ ′ ), but (1, n) 6∈ σ ′ . We consider two
cases according to whether n is or is not contained in J(σ).
Claim 4. Assume that 1 ∈ I(σ ′ ) and n ∈ J(σ ′ ) but (1, n) 6∈ σ ′ . This is equivalent to
(Rσ′ )2,n−1 = k ′ − 2, (Rσ′ )1,n−1 = (Rσ′ )2,n = k ′ − 1. Assume also that n 6∈ J(σ). This is
equivalent to (Rσ )1,n−1 = (Rσ )1,n . Then there exists s ∈ M(σ) such that σ ′ < σs− .

Proof.
If n 6∈ J(σ) then π1,n−1 (σ) = σ and l(π1,n−1 (σ)) − l(π1,n−1 (σ ′ )) = k − (k ′ − 1) ≥ 2. This
inequality permits us to use the induction hypothesis twice. Thus, there exists s ∈ M(σ)
and t ∈ M(σs− ) such that π1,n−1 (σ ′ ) ≤ (σs− )−            −
                                                      t < σs . Let im be min{is , it } then m ∈ M(σ)
                         − )i,j for all possible (i, j). In particular, (Rσ ′ )i,j ≤ (R − )i,j whenever
and (R(σs− )−t )i,j ≤ (Rσm                                                              σm
j < n. Considering σm , (σs− )−
                         −
                                  t  as elements    of  S  2
                                                           n we get
                                          (
                                            (Rσ )l,n ,              if l > im ;
                            (Rσm − )l,n =
                                            (R(σs− )−t )l,n−1 + 1, if l ≤ im .
On the other hand (Rσ′ )l,n ≤ (Rσ′ )l,n−1 + 1 ≤ (R(σs− )−t )l,n−1 + 1 for any l by definition
of (σs− )−
         t and the construction of the rank matrices. Thus, for l ≤ im we get (Rσ′ )l,n ≤
(Rσm− )l,n = (R − − )l,n−1 + 1. Finally, for l > im we get (Rσ ′ )l,n ≤ (R − )l,n = (Rσ )l,n .
                (σs )t                                                      σm
Altogether, this gives σ ′ < σm −
                                  . Note that the inequality is strict since (Rσm  − )1,n−1 =

k − 1 > (Rσ′ )1,n−1 = k ′ − 1.
                                                                                                   
Claim 5. Assume that 1 ∈ I(σ ′ ) and n ∈ J(σ ′ ) but (1, n) 6∈ σ ′ . This is equivalent to
(Rσ′ )2,n−1 = k ′ − 2, (Rσ′ )1,n−1 = (Rσ′ )2,n = k ′ − 1. Assume also that n ∈ J(σ). This is
equivalent to (Rσ )1,n−1 = (Rσ )1,n − 1. Then there exists s ∈ M(σ) such that σ ′ ≤ σs− .

Proof.
Again, consider π1,n−1 (σ), π1,n−1 (σ ′ ). Note that π1,n−1 (σ) > π1,n−1 (σ ′ ). We also have
l(π1,n−1 (σ)) = k − 1 > l(π1,n−1 (σ ′ )) = k ′ − 1. Thus, by induction hypothesis there exists
s ∈ M(π1,n−1 (σ)) such that π1,n−1 (σ ′ ) ≤ (π1,n−1 (σ))−   s . Let r = max{t ∈ M(σ)} then
jr = n. Let m = min{is , ir }. Again, m ∈ M(σ) by lemma 3.7 and (Rσ′ )i,j ≤ (Rσm           −)

whenever j < n. Note also
                                         (
                                          (Rσ )l,n ,         if l > im ;

                                          (Rσs− )l,n−1 + 1, if l ≤ im .
Thus, for l > im one has (Rσ′ )l,n ≤ (Rσ )l,n = (Rσm   − )l,n and for l ≤ im one has (Rσ )l,n ≤
                                                                        ′   −
(Rσ )l,n−1 + 1 ≤ (Rσs− )l,n−1 + 1 = (Rσm
                                       − )l,n . Altogether this gives σ ≤ σ .
                                                                            m

   In claims 1-5 we have considered all the possible cases described in lemma 3.2. There-
fore, the proof is completed.

3.10. Now we construct D1 (σ). It consists of four types of elements. In the next four
subsections we define these types and show that an element of the given type is in D1 (σ).
Then in subsection 3.15 we show that D1 (σ) consists of these four types of elements only.
   In the next five sections we set σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ) where is < is+1 for any s : 1 ≤
s < k and is < js for any s : 1 ≤ s ≤ k.
Lemma. . Let σ, σ ′ , σ ′′ ∈ S2n be such that σ ≥ σ ′ ≥ σ ′′ and l(σ) = l(σ ′ ) = l(σ ′′ ).
      (i) If I(σ) = I(σ ′′ ) then I(σ ′ ) = I(σ).
     (ii) If J(σ) = J(σ ′′ ) then J(σ ′ ) = J(σ).

Proof.
(i) Assume that I(σ) = I(σ ′′ ). Then by definition of a rank matrix (Rσ )i,n = (Rσ′′ )i,n
for all i. Since (Rσ )i,n ≤ (Rσ′ )i,n ≤ (Rσ′′ )i,n this forces (Rσ )i,n = (Rσ′ )i,n for all i. Thus
(Rσ′ )i,n = (Rσ′ )i+1,n + 1 ⇐⇒ (Rσ )i,n = (Rσ )i+1,n + 1. Hence, i ∈ I(σ) iff i ∈ I(σ ′ ).
     (ii) is obtained exactly in the same way.
                                                                                               

3.11. Let (is , js ) ∈ σ. Suppose there exists m < is satisfying both
      (i) m 6∈ I(σ) ∪ J(σ);
     (ii) Either m = is − 1 or for any t : m < t < is one has t ∈ I(π1,js (σ)) ∪ J(π1,js (σ)).
Then define σis ↑ to be obtained from σ by just changing (is , js ) to (m, js ). By the definition
such an m is unique, if it exists. If such an m does not exist put σis ↑ := ∅.
   For example, take σ = (2, 5)(3, 4)(7, 9)(8, 10). Then σ2↑ = (1, 5)(3, 4)(7, 9)(8, 10), σ3↑ =
∅, σ7↑ = (2, 5)(3, 4)(6, 9)(8, 10) and σ8↑ = (2, 5)(3, 4)(7, 9)(6, 10).
     If σis ↑ 6= ∅ then
                                         (
                                          (Rσ )i,j − 1, if m < i ≤ is and j ≥ js ;
                          (Rσis )i,j   =                                                       (∗)
                                          (Rσ )i,j ,    otherwise;
Thus, σis ↑ < σ.
Lemma. Take σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ). Let s : 1 ≤ s ≤ k be such that σis ↑ 6= ∅. Then

Proof.
The proof is by induction on n. The minimal n which permits such a situation to occur is
n = 3. In S23 there is a unique case of this type: σ = (2, 3) and σ2↑ = (1, 3). It is obvious
that σ2↑ ∈ D1 (σ). Assume the claim is true for n − 1.
  Suppose σis ↑ 6= ∅ for some s. Let σ ′ = (i′1 , j1′ ) . . . (i′k , jk′ ) be such that σ ≥ σ ′ ≥ σis ↑ . We
must show that either σ ′ = σ or σ ′ = σis ↑ .
   Note that by definition J(σ) = J(σis ↑ ). By lemma 3.10 this implies J(σ ′ ) = J(σ). Set
J := J(σ).
   Assume first that n 6∈ J. Passing to π1,n−1 we get π1,n−1 (σ) = σ, π1,n−1 (σ ′ ) = σ ′ and
π1,n−1 (σis ↑ ) = σis ↑ so that by the induction hypothesis either σ ′ = σ or σ ′ = σis ↑ .
   Now assume that n ∈ J. We have to consider two cases: either js = n or js < n.

     (i) Assume first that js = n. Then π1,n−1 (σis ↑ ) = π1,n−1 (σ) so that (Rσ )i,j = (Rσis ↑ )i,j =
         (Rσ′ )i,j whenever j < n. This is equivalent to (ir , jr ) ∈ σ if and only if (ir , jr ) ∈ σis ↑
         and thus also if and only if (ir , jr ) ∈ σ ′ whenever r 6= s. Suppose (i′s , n) ∈ σ ′ .
         Note that I(σ) \ {is } = I(σis ↑ ) \ {m} = I(σ ′ ) \ {i′s }. Denote this common set by
         Iˆ := I(σ) \ {is }.
             By (∗) and the structure of the rank matrices (Rσis ↑ )l,n = (Rσ )l,n = (Rσ )l,n−1
         whenever l > is and (Rσis ↑ )l,n = (Rσ )l,n = (Rσ )l,n−1 + 1 whenever l ≤ m. These
         equalities force (Rσ′ )l,n = (Rσ′ )l,n−1 whenever l > is and (Rσ′ )l,n = (Rσ′ )l,n−1 + 1
         whenever l ≤ m. Thus, by the structure of the rank matrices we get m ≤ i′s ≤ is .
         Further, by the definition of σis ↑ for any t : m < t < is one has t ∈ Iˆ ∪ J so that
         either i′s = is (that is σ ′ = σ) or i′s = m (that is σ ′ = σis ↑ ).
    (ii) Now assume that js < n.
          (a) Suppose (ir , n) ∈ σ (then (ir , n) ∈ σis ↑ as well) and (i′r , n) ∈ σ ′ . Let us
               show that i′r = ir . Indeed, by definition of σis ↑ one has either ir > is or
               ir < m. In both cases one has by (∗) that (Rσis ↑ )ir ,n−1 = (Rσ )ir ,n−1 and
               (Rσis ↑ )ir ,n = (Rσ )ir ,n = (Rσ )ir ,n−1 +1. One also has (Rσis ↑ )ir +1,n = (Rσis ↑ )ir ,n −
               1 = (Rσ )ir ,n −1 = (Rσ )ir +1,n . These equalities force (Rσ′ )ir +1,n = (Rσ′ )ir ,n−1 =
               (Rσ′ )ir ,n − 1. By the structure of the rank matrices this implies i′r = ir .
          (b) Since js < n one has π1,n−1 (σis ↑ ) = (π1,n−1 (σ))is ↑ . Thus, by the induction
               hypothesis either π1,n−1 (σ ′ ) = π1,n−1 (σ) or π1,n−1 (σ ′ ) = π1,n−1 (σis ↑ ). By (a)
               this implies that either σ ′ = σ or σ ′ = σis ↑ .

                                                                                                         


3.12. Again, let (is , js ) ∈ σ. Suppose there exists m > js satisfying both

     (i) m 6∈ I(σ) ∪ J(σ);
    (ii) Either m = js + 1 or for any t : js < t < m one has t ∈ I(πis ,n (σ)) ∪ J(πis ,n (σ)).

Then define σjs → to be obtained from σ just by changing (is , js ) to (is , m). Again, such
an m is unique, if it exists. If such an m does not exist put σjs → := ∅.
   For example, take σ = (2, 5)(3, 4)(7, 9)(8, 10) ∈ S211 . Then σ5→ = (2, 6)(3, 4)(7, 9)(8, 10), σ4→ =
∅, σ9→ = (2, 5)(3, 4)(7, 11)(8, 10) and σ10→ = (2, 5)(3, 4)(7, 9)(8, 11).
  By symmetry of the rank matrix about the anti-diagonal if σjs → 6= ∅ then σjs → < σ
and
                              (
                               (Rσ )i,j − 1, if js ≤ j < m and i ≤ is ;
               (Rσjs → )i,j =                                                     (∗′ )
                               (Rσ )i,j ,    otherwise;
Exactly as in 3.11 we get the
Lemma. Take σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ). Let s : 1 ≤ s ≤ k be such that σjs → 6= ∅. Then
σjs → ∈ D1 .

3.13. Consider (is , js ) ∈ σ for s ≥ 2 and suppose there exists jr < is satisfying one of the
conditions: either jr = is −1 or for any t : jr < t < is one has t ∈ I(πir ,js (σ))∪J(πir ,js (σ)).
Then define σjr ,is to be obtained from σ just by changing the cycles (ir , jr ), (is , js ) to the
cycles (ir , is ), (jr , js ).
   Note that for a given is there can exist a few possible jr . Let us denote the set of
all possible σjr ,is for a given is by Cis ↑→ (σ). If there is no r < s such that jr satisfies
conditions put Cis ↑→ (σ) := ∅.
   For example, take σ = (1, 3)(2, 4)(5, 8)(6, 7). Then C2↑→ (σ) = ∅, C5↑→ (σ) = {σ4,5 =
(1, 3)(2, 5)(4, 8)(6, 7), σ3,5 = (1, 5)(2, 4)(3, 8)(6, 7)} and C6↑→ = ∅.
     When σjr ,is is defined one has
                                     
                                     (Rσ )i,j − 1, if i ≤ ir and jr ≤ j < is ;
                                     
                     (Rσjr ,is )i,j = (Rσ )i,j − 1, if is ≤ i < jr and j ≥ js ;                       (∗∗)

                                        σ i,j       otherwise;

Thus, σjr ,is < σ.
Lemma. Take σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ). Let s : 2 ≤ s ≤ k and r : r < s be such that σjr ,is
exists. Then σjr ,is ∈ D1 .

Proof.
The proof is by induction on n. The minimal n which permits such a situation to occur
is n = 4. In S24 there is a unique case of this type: σ = (1, 2)(3, 4) and σ2,3 = (1, 3)(2, 4).
It is obvious that σ2,3 ∈ D1 (σ). Assume the claim is true for n − 1.
  Suppose σjr ,is ∈ Cis ↑→ (σ). Let σ ′ = (i′1 , j1′ ) . . . (i′k , jk′ ) be such that σjr ,is ≤ σ ′ ≤ σ. We
must show either σ ′ = σ or σ ′ = σjr ,is .

    Note that I(σ)∪J(σ) = I(σjr ,is )∪J(σjr ,is ). In particular, one has 1 ∈ I(σ) if and only if
1 ∈ I(σjr ,is ). By (∗∗) (Rσ )2,n = (Rσjr ,is )2,n , thus, (Rσ′ )2,n = (Rσ )2,n . Also, (Rσ )2,n = k − 1
if and only if 1 ∈ I(σ). Hence, 1 ∈ I(σ ′ ) ⇐⇒ 1 ∈ I(σ).
   Assume first that 1 6∈ I(σ). Passing to π2,n we get π2,n (σ) = σ, π2,n (σ ′ ) = σ ′ and
π2,n (σjr ,is ) = σjr ,is so that by the induction hypothesis either σ ′ = σ or σ ′ = σjr ,is .
   Now, let 1 ∈ I(σ).

     (i) Assume first that ir > 1. Then π2,n (σjr ,is ) = (π2,n (σ))jr ,is , thus, by the induc-
         tion hypothesis π2,n (σjr ,is ) ∈ D1 ((π2,n (σ))) so that either π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σ) or
         π2,n (σ ′ ) = (π2,n (σ))jr ,is .
          (a) If π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σ) then σ ′ < σ only if j1′ > j1 . In that case (Rσ′ )1,j1 =
               (Rσ )1,j1 − 1. On the other hand, since j1 6∈ [jr , is ] one has by (∗∗) that
               (Rσjr ,is )1,j1 = (Rσ )1,j1 , which contradicts the condition σ ′ ≥ σjr ,is . Thus,
               π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σ) implies σ ′ = σ.
          (b) If π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σjr ,is ) then σ ′ > σjr ,is only if j1′ < j1 . In that case (Rσ′ )1,j1′ =
               (Rσjr ,is )1,j1′ + 1. On the other hand since π2,n (σ ′ ) = (π2,n (σ))jr ,is one has j1′ 6∈
               [jr , is ] so that by (∗∗) (Rσjr ,is )1,j1′ = (Rσ )1,j1′ which contradicts the condition
               σ ′ ≤ σ. Thus, π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σjr ,is ) implies σ ′ = σjr ,is .
    (ii) Assume that ir = 1. In that case r = 1 and π2,n (σj1 ,is ) = (π2,n (σ))is ↑ . Thus, by
         Lemma 3.11 either π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σ) or π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σj1 ,is ).
            Assume first that π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σ). Then σ ′ < σ only if j1′ > j1 . By the
         conditions on the construction of σj1 ,is this implies j1′ > is so that by (∗∗)
         (Rσj1 ,is )1,is = (Rσ′ )1,is + 1 which contradicts σ ′ ≥ σj1 ,is . Thus, π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σ)
         implies σ ′ = σ.
            Now assume that π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σj1 ,is ). Then σ ′ > σj1 ,is only if j1′ < is . Again,
         by the conditions on construction of σj1 ,is this implies j1′ < j1 so that by (∗∗)
         (Rσ′ )1,j1′ = (Rσ )1,j1′ + 1 which contradicts σ ′ ≤ σ. Thus, π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σj1 ,is )
         implies σ ′ = σj1 ,is .

                                                                                                           


3.14. In the construction of the last type we use the notion M(σ) from 3.7. For (is , js ) ∈ σ
consider πis +1,js−1 (σ) and let M[is ,js ] (σ) := M(πis +1,js−1 (σ)). If M[is ,js] (σ) 6= ∅ then for
t ∈ M[is ,js ] (σ) define σis ,it to be obtained from σ just by changing the cycles (is , js ), (it , jt )
to the cycles (is , jt ), (it , js ). If M[is ,js] (σ) = ∅ put Cis ↑↓ (σ) := ∅ otherwise put Cis ↑↓ (σ) :=
{σis ,it : t ∈ M[is ,js] (σ)}.
   For example, take σ = (1, 8)(2, 5)(3, 4)(6, 7). Then

          C1↑↓ (σ) = {σ1,2 = (1, 5)(2, 8)(3, 4)(6, 7), σ1,6 = (1, 7)(2, 5)(3, 4)(6, 8)},
          C2↑↓ (σ) = {σ2,3 = (1, 8)(2, 4)(3, 5)(6, 7)},
          C3↑↓ (σ) = C6↑↓ (σ) = ∅.

     When σis ,it is defined one has,
                                     (
                                      (Rσ )i,j − 1, if it ≤ i < is and jt ≤ j < js ;
                    (Rσis ,it )i,j =                                                                 (∗ ∗ ∗)
                                      (Rσ )i,j ,    otherwise.

Thus, σis ,it < σ.
     In what follows we also need the following form of (∗ ∗ ∗):

Lemma. Take σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ). Let s : 1 ≤ s < k and t : t > s be such that σis ,it
exists. Then σis ,it ∈ D1 .

Proof.
The proof is by induction on n. The minimal n which permits such situation to occur is
n = 4. In S24 there is a unique case of this type: σ = (1, 4)(2, 3) and σ1,2 = (1, 3)(2, 4). It
is obvious that σ1,2 ∈ D1 (σ). Assume the claim is true for n − 1.
    Suppose σis ,it ∈ Cis ↑↓ (σ) for some s. Let σ ′ = (i′1 , j1′ ) . . . (i′k , jk′ ) be such that σis ,it ≤
σ ′ ≤ σ. We must show that either σ ′ = σ or σ ′ = σis ,it .
  Note that I(σ) = I(σis ,it ) and J(σ) = J(σis ,it ). Thus, by lemma 3.10 I(σ ′ ) = I(σ) and
J(σ ′ ) = J(σ). We will denote I := I(σ) and J := J(σ).
   Assume first that 1 6∈ I(σ). Passing to π2,n we get π2,n (σ) = σ, π2,n (σ ′ ) = σ ′ and
π2,n (σis ,it ) = σis ,it so that by the induction hypothesis either σ ′ = σ or σ ′ = σis ,it .
     Now, let 1 ∈ I(σ).

      (i) Assume first that s > 1. Then π2,n (σis ,it ) = (π2,n (σ))is ,it , thus, by induction hy-
          pothesis π2,n (σis ,it ) ∈ D1 ((π2,n (σ))) so that either π2,n (σ ′ ) = π2,n (σ) or π2,n (σ ′ ) =
          (π2,n (σ))is ,it . In both cases i′1 = 1 and j1′ = j1 since I(σ ′ ) = I and J(σ ′ ) = J. Thus,
          either σ ′ = σ or σ ′ = σis ,it .
     (ii) Now assume that s = 1. Consider π2,n (σ), π2,n (σ ′ ) and π2,n (σ1,it ). Note that
          I(π2,n (σ ′ )) = I \ {1} = I(π2,n (σ)) = I(π2,n (σ1,it )).
              Further note that for any m 6= t we get by the definition of M[1,js ] (σ) that
          either jm < jt , or im > it thus by (∗ ∗ ∗) (Rσ1,it )p,r = (Rσ )p,r for p = im , im + 1
          and r = jm , jm − 1. This forces also (Rσ′ )p,r = (Rσ )p,r for p = im , im + 1 and
                                                  ′
          r = jm , jm − 1. By Lemma 3.1 jm           = jm for any m : m > 1 and m 6= t. In other
          words for any m 6= 1, t one has (im , jm ) ∈ σ ′ . Since I(σ ′ ) = I and J(σ ′ ) = J we
          get that either (1, j1 ), (it , jt ) ∈ σ ′ (that is σ ′ = σ) or (1, jt ), (it , j1 ) ∈ σ ′ (that is
          σ ′ = σ1,it ).

lemmas 3.11-3.14 it remains to show that for any σ ′ =                       (i′1 , j1′ ) . . . (i′k , jk′ )
                                                                                  such that σ ′ < σ
there exist σ ′′ ∈ D ′ (σ) ∪ D ′′ (σ) such that σ ′′ ≥ σ ′ . This is a straightforward but rather
long computation. It involves the comparison of I(σ) and J(σ) with I(σ ′ ) and J(σ ′ ). As
in the proof of proposition 3.9 the argument is broken into the six claims.
   Since l(σ ′ ) = l(σ) one has that I(σ ′ ) ∪ J(σ ′ ) 6= I(σ) ∪ J(σ) implies the existence of
q ∈ I(σ ′ ) ∪ J(σ ′ ) such that q 6∈ I(σ) ∪ J(σ).
Claim 1. Assume that there exists q ∈ I(σ ′ ) such that q 6∈ I(σ) ∪ J(σ). Then there exists
s ∈ M(πq+1,n (σ)) such that σis ↑ ≥ σ ′ .

Proof.
Note that (Rσ′ )q,n = (Rσ′ )q+1,n + 1 and (Rσ )q,n = (Rσ )q+1,n . Since (Rσ′ )q,n ≤ (Rσ )q,n this
implies (Rσ′ )q+1,n < (Rσ )q+1,n so that by Proposition 3.9 there exists s ∈ M(πq+1,n (σ))
such that (πq+1,n (σ))−                ′
                      s ≥ πq+1,n (σ ). Consider σis ↑ . Since s ∈ M(πq+1,n (σ)) and q 6∈ I(σ)
one has σis ↑ 6= ∅. Moreover m ≥ q. Hence,
                                     (
                                       ≥ (R(πq+1,n (σ))−s )i,j , if i ≥ q + 1;
                        (Rσis ↑ )i,j
                                       = (Rσ )i,j ,              if i ≤ q.
Thus, σis ↑ ≥ σ ′ .
                                                                                                                               
   By symmetry of the rank matrix around the anti-diagonal we get the same result for
the case q ∈ J(σ ′ ). We need the complete formulation of this result in what follows.
Claim 2. Assume that there exists q ∈ J(σ ′ ) such that q 6∈ I(σ) ∪ J(σ). Then there exists
r ∈ M(π1,q−1 (σ)) such that σjr → ≥ σ ′ .

   Now we have to consider the case I(σ ′ ) ∪ J(σ ′ ) = I(σ) ∪ J(σ). (Note that this does not
imply I(ω) ∪ J(ω) = I(σ) ∪ J(σ) for all ω : σ ≥ ω ≥ σ ′′ ). We show that in this case
there exists σ ′′ ∈ D ′ (σ) ∪ D ′′ (σ) such that σ ′′ ≥ σ ′ . The proof is by induction. For n = 4
it holds trivially, as we have seen in 3.13, 3.14. Assume it for n − 1.
Claim 3. Assume that I(σ ′ ) ∪ J(σ ′ ) = I(σ) ∪ J(σ). Let n 6∈ J(σ). Then there exists
σ ′′ ∈ D ′ (σ) ∪ D ′′ (σ) such that σ ′′ ≥ σ ′ .

Proof.
Since n 6∈ J(σ), J(σ ′ ) one has π1,n−1 (σ) = σ and π1,n−1 (σ ′ ) = σ ′ . Thus, by the induction
hypothesis there exists σ ′′ ∈ D ′ (π1,n−1 (σ)) ∪ D ′′ (π1,n−1 (σ) such that σ ′′ ≥ π1,n−1 (σ ′ ).
Considering σ ′′ as an element of S2n we get the result.
                                                                                                                  
    Now assume that n ∈ J(σ). Possibly changing the order of pairs we write σ =
(i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik−1 , jk−1 )(i, n) and σ ′ = (i′1 , j1′ ) . . . (i′k−1 , jk−1
                                                                             ′
                                                                                 )(i′ , n). Let us start with the case
i 6= i. In that case i ∈ I(π1,n−1 (σ )) ∪ J(π1,n−1 (σ )) so that either i ∈ I(π1,n−1 (σ ′ )) or
 ′                                             ′                           ′

i ∈ J(π1,n−1 (σ ′ )). We consider each case in a separate claim.
Claim 4. Assume I(σ ′ ) ∪ J(σ ′ ) = I(σ) ∪ J(σ). Let (i, n) ∈ σ, and (i, n) 6∈ σ ′ . Assume
i ∈ I(σ ′ ). Then there exists it ∈ I(σ) such that it > i and σi,it ≥ σ ′ .

Proof.
Since i 6∈ I(π1,n−1 (σ)) one has (Rσ )i,n−1 = (Rσ )i+1,n−1 . Since i ∈ I(σ ′ ) and (i, n) 6∈ σ ′
one has i ∈ I(π1,n−1 (σ ′ )). Thus, (Rσ′ )i,n−1 = (Rσ′ )i+1,n−1 + 1. Since σ ′ < σ, in particular,
one has (Rσ′ )i,n−1 ≤ (Rσ )i,n−1. Therefore, (Rσ′ )i+1,n−1 < (Rσ )i+1,n−1 . By Proposition
3.9 there exists t ∈ M(πi+1,n−1 (σ)) such that (πi+1,n−1 (σ))−                      ′
                                                                   t ≥ πi+1,n−1 (σ ). Note that
(πi+1,n−1 (σ))−                −
              t = πi+1,n−1 (σt ). In particular, (Rσ′ )p,q ≤ (Rσt− )p,q whenever p ≥ i + 1 and
q ≤ n − 1.
     Note also that t ∈ M[i,n] (σ) so that σi,it exists. By 3.14 (∗ ∗ ∗′ )
                                        (

                                          (Rσt− )p,q otherwise;
Hence, σi,it ≥ σ ′ .
                                                                                                                  
Claim 5. Assume I(σ ′ ) ∪ J(σ ′ ) = I(σ) ∪ J(σ). Let (i, n) ∈ σ and i ∈ J(σ ′ ). Then there
exists r ∈ M(π1,i−1 (σ)) such that σ ′′ ≥ σ ′ where σ ′′ = σjr → or σ ′′ = σjr ,i.

Proof.

   Since i ∈ J(π1,n−1 (σ ′ )) and i 6∈ I(π1,n−1 (σ)) ∪ J(π1,n−1 (σ)) by Claim 2 there exists
r ∈ M(π1,i−1 (σ)) such that (π1,n−1 (σ))jr → ≥ π1,n−1 (σ ′ ).
   If there exists r ∈ M(π1,i−1 (σ)) such that m < i then σjr → 6= ∅ and σjr → ≥ σ ′ . Indeed,
π1,n−1 (σjr → ) = (π1,n−1 (σ))jr → so that (Rσjr → )p,q ≥ (Rσ′ )p,q whenever q < n and by (∗′ ) of
3.12 (Rσjr → )p,n = (Rσ )p,n ≥ (Rσ′ )p,n for any p.
  If for every r ∈ M(π1,i−1 (σ)) one has m = i then σjr ,i exists for every r. Let us take
maximal such r. Let us show that σjr ,i ≥ σ ′ .
      (i) (Rσjr ,i )p,q = (R(π1,n−1 (σ))jr → )p,q ≥ (Rσ′ )p,q whenever q < n.

    (ii) By 3.13 (∗∗) (Rσjr ,i )p,n = (Rσ )p,n whenever either p > i or p ≤ jr . Thus, (Rσjr ,i )p,n ≥
         (Rσ′ )p,n whenever either p > i or p ≤ jr .
   (iii) Since i ∈ J(σ ′ ), J(σjr ,i) we get by the form of the rank matrix (Rσ′ )i,n = (Rσ′ )i+1,n
         and (Rσjr ,i )i,n = (Rσjr ,i )i+1,n so that (Rσ′ )i,n ≤ (Rσjr ,i )i,n .
   (iv) Since r is maximal and m = i by definition of σjr → one has t ∈ I(σ) for any
         t : jr < t < i, thus, also t ∈ I(σjr ,i ) for any such t. Therefore, for any t : jr <
         t < i, one has (Rσjr ,i )t,n = (Rσjr ,i )i,n + (t − i). On the other hand by the form of
         the rank matrix (Rσ′ )t,n ≤ (Rσ′ )i,n + (t − i), so that (Rσ′ )t,n ≤ (Rσjr ,i )t,n for any
         t : jr < t < i.
Together (i)-(iv) give us σjr ,i ≥ σ ′ .

Claim 6. Assume I(σ ′ ) ∪ J(σ ′ ) = I(σ) ∪ J(σ). Let (i, n) ∈ σ, σ ′ . Then there exists
σ ′′ ∈ D ′ (σ) ∪ D ′′ (σ) such that σ ′′ ≥ σ ′ .

Proof.
Since I(π1,n−1 (σ)) ∪ J(π1,n−1 (σ)) = I(π1,n−1 (σ ′ )) ∪ J(π1,n−1 (σ ′ )) by the induction hypoth-
esis there exists σ̂ ∈ D ′ (π1,n−1 (σ)) ∪ D ′′ (π1,n−1 (σ)) such that σ̂ ≥ π1,n−1 (σ ′ ).
   Assume i 6∈ I(σ̂) ∪ J(σ̂). Then σ̂(i, n) ∈ S2n and σ ′ ≤ σ̂(i, n) < σ. Moreover,
     (i)   If   σ̂   = (π1,n−1 (σ))iq ,ir then either ir < i or iq > i so that σ̂(i, n) = σiq ,ir .
    (ii)   If   σ̂   = (π1,n−1 (σ))jr ,iq then either iq < i or jr > i so that σ̂(i, n) = σjr ,iq .
   (iii)   If   σ̂   = (π1,n−1 (σ))is ↑ and either is < i or m > i then σ̂(i, n) = σis ↑ .
   (iv)    If   σ̂   = (π1,n−1 (σ))js→ and either js > i or m < i then σ̂(i, n) = σis → .
Setting σ ′′ = σ̂(i, n) we get the result.
   It is left to consider the two cases when i ∈ I(σ̂) ∪ J(σ̂).
    (i) If σ̂ = (π1,n−1 (σ))is ↑ and m = i let σ ′′ = σi,is . It exists since s ∈ M[i,n] (σ). Moreover,
        σi,is ≥ σ ′ since (Rσi,is )p,q = (Rσ̂ )p,q whenever q < n and (Rσi,is )p,n = (Rσ )p,n for
        any p.
   (ii) If σ̂ = (π1,n−1 (σ))js → and m(js ) = i we need a more subtle analysis. First note
        that in this case (Rσ )1,i > (Rσ′ )1,i . Indeed, (Rσ̂ )1,i = (Rσ̂ )1,i−1 + 1 and (Rσ′ )1,i =
        (Rσ′ )1,i−1 . Thus, (Rσ̂ )1,i−1 ≥ (Rσ′ )1,i−1 provides (Rσ )1,i ≥ (Rσ̂ )1,i > (Rσ′ )1,i . Since
        (Rσ )1,n = (Rσ′ )1,n there exists j > i such that
         (a) p ∈ J(σ ′ ) implies p ∈ J(σ) for any p : i < p < j;
         (b) j ∈ J(σ ′ ) and j 6∈ J(σ).
        Since I(σ) ∪ J(σ) = I(σ ′ ) ∪ J(σ ′ ) statements (a) and (b) are equivalent to
        (a’) p ∈ I(σ) implies p ∈ I(σ ′ ) for any p : i < p < j;
        (b’) j ∈ I(σ) and j 6∈ I(σ ′ ).
           Thus by (b’) (Rσ )j,n−1 = (Rσ )j+1,n−1 + 1 and (Rσ′ )j,n−1 = (Rσ′ )j+1,n−1 so that
        (Rσ )j,n−1 > (Rσ′ )j,n−1 . By (a’) this provides (Rσ )i+1,n−1 > (Rσ′ )i+1,n−1.

               Thus, by Proposition 3.9 there exists t such that πi+1,n−1 (σ ′ ) ≤ (πi+1,n−1 (σ))−

3.16. The two previous propositions involve in their proofs long and tricky combinatorics.
At least I have not succeeded to find shorter and simpler proofs. On the other hand the
proof of the following lemma is more straightforward.
Lemma. For any σ ∈ S2n and for any σ ′ ∈ D1 (σ) ∪ D2 (σ) one has Bσ′ ⊂ B σ .

Proof.
Consider σ = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ) and σ ′ ∈ D1 (σ) ∪ D2 (σ). Since the metric topology has
more open sets than the Zariski topology it is enough to show that Nσ′ ∈ B σ for the metric
topology on End Cn . We construct a one parameter family of matrices {Ak } ∈ B such
that lim Ak Nσ A−1
                 k = Nσ′ in the metric topology. Each Ak will be an elementary upper-
        k→∞
triangular matrix or a product of elementary upper-triangular matrices. We construct
them explicitly. Let Ei (a) and Ei+j (a) be the invertible matrices defined as follows
                       (                                     (
                        a, if s = t = i;                      a, if s = i, t = j;
         (Ei (a))s,t =                       (Ei+j (a))s,t =
                        δs,t otherwise.                       δs,t otherwise.
One checks that Nσ′ = lim Ak Nσ A−1
                                 k where Ak are given as follows
                                       k→∞

       (i)   For     σ′   = σs− take Ak = Eis ( k1 );
      (ii)   For     σ′   = σis take Ak = Eis ( k1 )Ems +is (1);
     (iii)   For     σ′   = σjs take Ak = Eis ( k1 )Ejs +mjs (−k);
     (iv)    For     σ′   = σjr ,is take Ak = Eir (− k1 )Eis ( k1 )Ejr +is (1);
      (v)    For     σ′   = σis ,it take Ak = Ejt (k)Ejs (− k1 Eis +it (k)Ejt +js ( k1 ).

         the proof.

3.18. Now we can prove theorem 3.5. Let us recall it
Theorem. For any σ ∈ S2n one has
                                                      a

                                                      σ′ ≤σ


Proof.
By 3.4 Bσ ⊂ Vσ . Let us show that dim Vσ = dim Bσ and that Bσ is the only component
in Vσ of maximal dimension. Indeed, since Bσ ⊂ Vσ we get that dim Vσ ≥ dim Bσ . For
any σ ′ such that dim Bσ′ ≥ dim Bσ we have Bσ′ 6∈ B σ . Thus by 3.17(i) one has σ ′ 6< σ.
That means that there exists i, j such that (Rσ′ )i,j > (Rσ )i,j , so that Bσ′ 6⊂ Vσ . Hence,
dim Vσ = dim Bσ and Bσ is the only component of this dimension in Vσ . This together
with 3.8 and 3.11 gives:              a       [

The result follows by induction on order. Indeed, it is immediate that Vσ = Bσ = Bσ {0}

                 4. Results on orbital varieties of nilpotent order 2

4.1. Let us apply the results of section 3 to the study of orbital varieties of nilpotent order
2 in sln . First we recall some facts about such orbital varieties and then in subsections
4.4, 4.5 formulate and prove the corollaries of section 3 for orbital varieties.
   Recall the notion of a Young tableau from 1.5. We fill the boxes of Dλ ∈ Dn with
n distinct positive integers (instead of integers 1, . . . , n) in such a manner that entries
increase in rows from left to right and in columns from top to bottom. We call such an
32                                     ANNA MELNIKOV




array a Young tableau or simply a tableau. If the numbers in a Young tableau form the
set of integers from 1 to n, then the tableau is called a standard Young tableau. Again,
for any Young tableau T associated to Dλ we put sh (T ) = λ.
     Let Tn denote the set of all standard Young tableaux of size n.
   Let T2n ∈ Tn be the subset of standard Young tableaux with two columns. Let T =
                         t1,1                                      t1,2
                                                                     

(T1 , T2 ), where T1 =  ...  is the first column of T and T2 =  ...  is the second
                         tl,1                                      tk,2
column of T.
   Set σT = (i1 , j1 ) . . . (ik , jk ) where js = ts,2; i1 = t1,2 − 1, and is = max{d ∈ T1 \
{i1 , . . . , is−1 } | d < js } for any s > 1. Note that now we order the cycles of σ so that the
second entries increase. For example, take

                                               1 4
                                               2 5
                                         T =             ,
                                               3 7
                                               6 8

Then σT = (3, 4)(2, 5)(6, 7)(1, 8).
   Let us denote BT := BσT . Recall the notion of UT from 1.5. As we explained there if
an orbital variety is associated to a nilpotent orbit of nilpotent order 2, then it contains
a dense B−orbit. Explicitly by [11, 4.13] one has
Proposition. For T ∈ T2n one has BT = U T .

4.2. Let us induce geometric and algebraic orders, defined in 2.11 from S2n to T2n . For
                  G          G                 A             A
T, S ∈ T2n set T ≤ S if σT ≤ σS and set T ≤ S if σT ≤ σS . As a straightforward corollary
of [14, 3.7] we get that these two orders coincide, that is
                                         G           A
Theorem. For T, S ∈ T2n one has T ≤ S iff T ≤ S.

     Since these two orders coincide on T2n we can define a partial order on T2n by taking
             G
T ≤ S if T ≤ S.

4.3. For T ∈ T2n set D(T ) to be what is called in combinatorics the cover of T , that is
                   D(T ) := {S | S > T and if S ≥ U > T then U = S}.
In [14, 3.18] D(T ) is described explicitly.

Note that for any p < s one has i′p = ip . For p > s one has i′p = ip if and only if i′p > ts,2 .

                                                  S≥T


Proof.
Since BT is dense in UT we get
                                                             a
                               UT = B T ∩ OT =                            Bσ′ .
                                                             σ ′ ≤σ
                                                          l(σ ′ )=l(σ)


On the other hand by theorem 3.5
                           a                  a                 a           a
                      BT =     Bσ′ =                      Bσ′                           Bσ′ .
                               σ′ ≤σ          σ ′ ≤σ                        σ ′ <σ
                                           l(σ ′ )=l(σ)                  l(σ ′ )<l(σ)


Further, by definition of D2 (σ) we get that for any σ ′ such that σ ′ < σ and l(σ ′ ) < l(σ)
there exists σ ′′ ∈ D2 (σ) such that σ ′′ ≥ σ ′ . In other words, by theorem 3.5, Bσ′ ⊂ Bσ′′ .
Thus, we get
                                                 a [
                               U T = BT = UT                 B σ′ .

Let us show that D2 (σT ) = {σS }S∈D(T ) . Indeed, take T = (T1 , T2 ) where T1 =  ... 
                                                                                                          tl,1
                 t1,2
                     

and T2 =  ...  . Then σT = (ti1 ,1 , t1,2 ) . . . (tik ,1 , tk,2 ) where ti1 ,1 = max{ts,1 : ts,1 <
                 tk,2
a1,2 } and tij ,1 = max{ts,1 : ts,1 ∈ T1 \ {ti1 ,1 , . . . , tij−1 ,1 }, ts,1 < tj,k } whenever j > 1. Since
now the cycles of σT are ordered so that the second entries increase, one has j ∈ M(σT )
⇐⇒ tij ,1 = max{ti1 ,1 , . . . , tij ,1 } so that j ∈ M(σT ) if and only if (σT )−      j = σT htj,2 i for some
                                                 ` S
T htj,2i ∈ D(T ). Thus, we get BT = UT                       US.

Rank (S) ≤ k − 1. Thus,
