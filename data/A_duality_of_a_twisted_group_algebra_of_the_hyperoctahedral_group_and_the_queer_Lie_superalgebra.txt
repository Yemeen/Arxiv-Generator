                                                                              §1. Introduction
                                                We establish a duality relation (Theorem 4.2) between one of the twisted group
                                             algebras, of the hyperoctahedral group Hk (or the Weyl group of type Bk ) and a
                                             Lie superalgebra q(n0 ) ⊕ q(n1 ) for any integers k ≥ 4 and n0 , n1 ≥ 1. Here q(n0 )
                                             and q(n1 ) denote the “queer” Liesuperalgebras as called by some authors. The
                                             twisted group algebra Bk′ in focus in this paper belongs to a different cocycle from
                                             the one Bk used by A. N. Sergeev in his work [8] on a duality with q(n) and by the
                                             present author in a previous work [11]. This Bk′ contains the twisted group algebra
                                             Ak of the symmetric group Sk in a straightforward manner (§1. 1. 1), and has a
                                             structure similar to the semidirect product of Ak and C[(Z/2Z)k ]. (Bk′ and Bk were
                                             denoted by C[−1,+1,+1] Wk and C[+1,+1,−1]Wk respectively by J. R. Stembridge in
                                             [10].)
                                                In §2, we construct the Z2 -graded simple Bk′ -modules (where Z2 = Z/2Z) using
                                             an analogue of the little group method. These simple Bk′ modules are slightly
                                             different from the non-graded simple Bk′ -modules constructed by Stembridge in
                                             [10] because of the difference between Z2 -graded and non-graded theories, but they
                                                                                                                     .
                                             can easily be translated into each other. We will use the algebra Ck ⊗Bk′ , where Ck is
                                                                                                     .
                                             the 2k -dimensional Clifford algebra (cf. (3.2)) and ⊗ denotes the Z2 -graded tensor
                                             product (cf. [1], [2], [11, §1]), as an intermediary for establishing our duality, as we
                                             explain below. The construction of the simple Bk′ -modules leads to a construction
                                                                .
                                             of the simple Ck ⊗ Bk′ -modules in §3.
                                                                                            .
                                                In §4, we define a representation of Ck ⊗ Bk′ in the k-fold tensor product W =
                                             V ⊗k of V = Cn0 +n1 ⊕ Cn0 +n1 , the space of the natural  .
                                                                                                            representation of the Lie
                                                                                                           ′
                                             superalgebra q(n0 + n1 ). This representation of Ck ⊗ Bk depends on n0 and n1 ,
                                                                                                                          .
                                             not just n0 + n1 . Note that Bk can be regarded as a subalgebra of Ck ⊗ Bk′ , since
                                                                         .
                                             Bk is isomorphic to Ck ⊗ Ak by our previous result (cf. (3.3) of [11]). Under this
                                                                                        .
                                             embedding, our representation of Ck ⊗ Bk′ restricts to the representation of Bk in

                                                                                                                Typeset by AMS-TEX

                                                                                 .
W defined by Sergeev (cf. Theorem A). We show that the centralizer of Ck ⊗ Bk′ in
End(W ) is generated by the action of the Lie superalgebra q(n0 ) ⊕ q(n1 ) (Theorem
4.1). Moreover we show that Bk′ and q(n0 ) ⊕ q(n1 ) act on a subspace W ′ of W “as
mutual centralizers of each other” (Theorem 4.2). Note that Ak and q(n) act on
the same space W ′ “as mutual centralizers of each other” (cf. Theorem B).
   In Appendix, we include short explanations of some known reults, which we use
in the previous sections.
   In this paper, all vector spaces, and associative algebras, and representations
are assumed to be finite dimensional over C unless specified otherwise. The precise
statements of the results skeched in the introduction use the formulation of Z2 -
graded representations of Z2 -graded algebras (superalgebras) (cf. §1.1.3) as was
used in [1] and [2].
1.1 Preliminaries.
   1.1.1. A twisted group algebra Bk′ . For any k ≥ 1, let Bk′ denote the associative
algebra generated by τ ′ and the γi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, with relations

(1.1)
           2
         τ ′ = γi2 = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1),       (γi γi+1 )3 = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 2),
         (γi γj )2 = −1 (|i − j| ≥ 2),   (τ ′ γi )2 = 1 (2 ≤ i ≤ k − 1),
         (τ ′ γ1 )4 = 1.

If k ≥ 4, then Bk′ is isomorphic to a twisted group algebra of the hyperoctahedral
group Hk with a non-trivial 2-cocycle (cf. [10, Prop. 1.1]). We regard Bk′ as a
Z2 -graded algebra by giving the generator τ ′ (resp. the generator γi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1)
degree 0 (resp. degree 1). Note that this grading of Bk′ is different from that of Bk
in (3.1) or in [11].
   Let Ak denote the Z2 -graded subalgebra of Bk′ generated by γi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
If k ≥ 4, then Ak is isomorphic to a twisted group algebra of the symmetric group
Sk with a non-trivial 2-cocycle, with the Z2 -grading as in [2] and [11].
   1.1.2. Partitions and symmetric
                         `          functions. Let Pk denote the set of all parti-
tions of k, and put P = k≥0 Pk . For λ ∈ P , we write l(λ) for the length of λ,
namely the number of non-zero parts of λ. Also we write |λ| = k if λ ∈ Pk . Let
DPk and OPk denote the distinct partitions (or strict partitions, namely partitions
whose parts are distinct) and the odd partitions (namely partitions whose parts
are all odd) of k respectively. Let DPk+ and DPk− be the sets of all λ ∈ DPk
such that (−1)k−l(λ) = +1 and −1 respectively. Note that (−1)k−l(λ) ` equals the
signature of permutations with cycle type λ. We also put DP = k≥0 DPk and
       `
OP = k≥0 OPk . Let (DP 2 )k (resp. (OP 2 )k ) denote the set of all (λ, µ) ∈ DP 2
                                                     +             −
(resp. OP 2 ) such that |λ| + |µ| = k. Let (DP 2 )k and (DP 2 )k be the sets of all
(λ, µ) ∈ (DP 2 )k such that (−1)k−l(λ)−l(µ) = +1 and −1 respectively.
   Let Λx denote the ring of the symmetric functions in infinitely many variables
x = {x1 , x2 , . . . } with coefficients in C; namely our Λx is the scalar extension of
the Λx in [6], which is Z-algebra, to C.
                                          2
   Let Ωx denote the subring of Λx generated by the power sums of odd degrees,
namelyQ the pr (x), r = 1, 3, 5, . . . . Then {pλ (x) | λ ∈ OP } is a basis of Ωx , where
pλ = i≥1 pλi . For λ ∈ DP , let Qλ (x) ∈ Λx denote Schur’s Q-function indexed by
λ (cf. [7], [9, §6]). Then {Qλ (x) | λ ∈ DP } is also a basis of Ωx .
    1.1.3. Semisimple superalgebras. This theory was developed by T. Józefiak in
[1], which we mostly follow. A Z2 -graded algebra A, which is called a superalgebra
in this paper, is called simple if it does not have non-trivial Z2 -graded two-sided
ideals. If A is a simple superalgebra, then it is either isomorphic to M (m, n)
(denoted by M (m|n) in [2]) for some m and n, or isomorphic to Q(n) for some n
(see [2], [13, §1] for the definitions of simple superalgebras M (m, n), Q(n)).
    Let V be an A-module, namely a Z2 -graded vector space V = V0 ⊕ V1 together
with a representation ρ : A → End(V ) satisfying ρ(Aα )Vβ ⊂ Vα+β (α, β ∈ Z2 ). We
simply write ρ(a)v = av for a ∈ A and v ∈ V . By an A-submodule of V we mean a
Z2 -graded ρ(A)-stable subspace of V . We say that V is simple if it does not have
non-trivial A-submodules.
    Let V and W be two A-modules. Let Homα        A (V, W ) (α ∈ Z2 ) denote the subspace
of Homα (V, W ) = {f ∈ Hom(V, W ) ; f (Vβ ) ⊂ Wα+β } consisting of all elements
f ∈ Homα (V, W ) such that f (av) = (−1)α·β af (v) for a ∈ Aβ (β ∈ Z2 ), v ∈ V . Put
Hom·A (V, W ) = Hom0A (V, W ) ⊕ Hom1A (V, W ) and put End·A (V ) = Hom·A (V, V ).
We call End·A (V ) the supercentralizer of A in End(V ). Two A-modules V and
W are called isomorphic if there exists an invertible linear map f ∈ Hom·A (V, W ).
If this is the case, we write V ∼   =A W (or simply write V ∼     = W ). If V and W are
                               ∼
simple A-modules, then V = W if and only if there exists an invertible element in
Hom0A (V, W ) or Hom1A (V, W ). Note that, in [11] we distinguished between V and
the shift of V which is defined to be the same vector space as V with the switched
grading. In this paper, however, we identify V and the shift of V .
    If V is a simple A-module, then End·A (V ) is isomorphic to either M (1, 0) ∼   = C or
Q(1) ∼ = 1C  (cf. [1, Prop. 2.17], [2, Prop. 2.5, Cor.  2.6]). In the former (resp. latter)
case, we say that V is of type M (resp. of type Q). This gives the following
theorem (see [1], [2], [11, §1] for the definition of the “supertensor product” of the
superalgebras or modules).
                               .
Theorem 1.1. Let C = A ⊗ B be the supertensor product of superalgebras A and
B and let V = U ⊗ W be the supertensor product of a simple A-module U and a
simple B-module W .
   (a) If U , W are of type M , then V is a simple C-module of type M .
   (b) If one of U and W is of type M and the other is of type Q, then V is a
       simple C-module of type Q.
   (c) If U and W are of type Q, then V is a sum of two copies of a simple
       C-module X of type M : V = X ⊕ X.
                                                           .
Moreover, the above construction gives all simple A ⊗ B-modules.
                                                       .               .
   Using the above U , W , V and X, define an A ⊗ B-module U ◦ W by
                             
                      .        V if U or W is of type M ,
(1.2)              U ◦W =
                               X if U and W are of type Q.
                                            3
  Let Irr A denote the set of all isomorphism classes of simple A-modules for any
superalgebra A.
Corollary 1.2. We have a bijection
                   .                                     ∼       .                .

                                   §2. Simple modules for Bk′
     The simple Ak -modules are parametrized by DPk (cf. [2], [7], [9]). For λ ∈ DPk ,
let Vλ denote a simple Ak -module indexed by λ. Then Vλ is of type M (resp.
of type Q) if λ ∈ DPk+ (resp. λ ∈ DPk− ). We construct a Bk′ -module Vλ,µ for
(λ, µ) ∈ (DP 2 )k as follows. Define a surjective homomorphism of superalgebras
πk : Bk′ → Ak (resp. πk′ : Bk′ → Ak ) by πk (τ ′ ) = 1, πk |Ak = idAk (resp.πk′ (τ ′ ) = −1,
πk′ |Ak = idAk ). The simple Ak′ (resp. Ak−k′ )-module Vλ (resp. Vµ ) can be lifted
                   ′
to a Bk′ ′ (resp. Bk−k                              ′              ′
                       ′ )-module via πk ′ (resp. πk−k ′ ), where k = |λ|. This (simple)
  ′            ′
Bk′ (resp. Bk−k′ )-module is denoted by Vλ,φ (resp. Vφ,µ ). Let Vλ,µ denote the
                                     .                        .
Bk′ -module induced from the Bk′ ′ ⊗ Bk−k′
                                             ′ -module Vλ,φ ◦ Vφ,µ , namely

                                                                      .
                                Vλ,µ = Bk′ ⊗B′     .
                                                     ′
                                                   ⊗Bk−k
                                                              (Vλ,φ ◦ Vφ,µ )
                                                k′       ′

                           .                              .
                                                   ′
(see the definition of ◦ in (1.2)), where Bk′ ′ ⊗ Bk−k                     ′
                                                       ′ is embedded into Bk via

                       .                .
                τ ′ ⊗ 1 7→ τ ′ ,     γi ⊗ 1 7→ γi       (1 ≤ i ≤ k′ − 1),
                   .                        .
                1 ⊗ τ ′ 7→ τk′ ′ +1 ,   1 ⊗ γj 7→ γk′ +j        (1 ≤ j ≤ k − k′ − 1)

where τi′ = γi−1 γi−2 · · · γ1 τ ′ γ1 · · · γi−2 γi−1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
Theorem 2.1.(cf. [10], Th. 7.1) {Vλ,µ | (λ, µ) ∈ (DP 2 )k } is a complete set of the
isomorphism classes of simple Bk′ -modules. Vλ,µ is of type M (resp. of type Q) if
                +                        −
(λ, µ) ∈ (DP 2 )k (resp. (λ, µ) ∈ (DP 2 )k )
   The proof is analogous to the little group method, and is omitted. It can also be
shown that this parametrization coincides with that by Stembridge in [10, Theorem

We regard Bk as a superalgebra by giving the generator τ ′ (resp. the generator σi ,
1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) degree 1 (resp. degree 0). The subgroup of (Bk )× generated by σi ,
1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, is isomorphic to the symmetric group of degree k and it is denoted
by Sk .
    Let Ck denote the 2k -dimensional Clifford algebra, namely Ck is generated by

We regard Ck as a superalgebra by giving the generator ξi , 1 ≤ i ≤ k, degree 1.
Ck is a simple superalgebra. Let Xk be a unique simple Ck -module. If k is even

                      §4. A duality of Bk′ and q(n0 ) ⊕ q(n1 )
   Let q(n) denote the Lie subsuperalgebra
                                              ofgl(n, n) (denoted by l(n, n) in [5])

X, Y ∈ q(n), where the symbol ¯ expresses the degree of a homogeneous element.
This Lie superalgebra is called the queer Lie superalgebra. Let Un = U (q(n)) denote
the universal enveloping algebra of q(n), which can be regarded as a superalgebra.
Let W denote the k-fold supertensor product of the 2n-dimensional natural repre-
sentation V = V0 ⊕ V1 , dim V = (n, n), namely W = V ⊗k , where dim V denotes
the pair (dim V0 , dim V1 ). We define a representation Θ : Un → End(W ) by

for all homogeneous elements X ∈ q(n) and vi ∈ V (1 ≤ i ≤ k). Note that Un is an
infinite dimensional superalgebra. However, for a fixed number k, Un acts on W
through its finite dimensional image in End(W ). Therefore we can use the results
in §1.1.3 on finite dimensional superalgebras and their finite dimensional modules.
   Let n0 and n1 be two positive integers such that n0 + n1 = n. The Lie superal-

    The universal enveloping algebra of q(n0 ) ⊕ q(n1 ) is isomorphic to Un0 ⊗ Un1
which can be embedded into Un as a subalgebra generated by the elements of
q(n0 ) ⊕ q(n1 ).
    Now we define a representation Ψ : B̂k → End(W ), which depends on n0 and
n1 , by

Note that, by the isomorphism ϑ : Bk ∼ = Ck ⊗ Ak ⊂ B̂k , W can be regarded as a
Bk -module and this Bk -module was investigated by Sergeev in [8] (cf. Theorem A).
Then observing the actions of ϑ(τ ), ϑ(σi ) ∈ Bk′ , 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, on W , we have
(4.3,)
         Ψ (ϑ(τ )) (v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vk ) = (P v1 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ vk ,

for all homogeneous elements vj ∈ V , 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1.
                        .
   Let W ′ be a Un0 ⊗ Un1 -submodule of W . Since (q(n0 ) ⊕ q(n1 ))0 ∼   = gl(n0 , C) ⊕
gl(n1 , C) as a Lie algebra, and V is a sum of two copies (V0 and V1 ) of the nat-
ural representation of gl(n0 , C) ⊕ gl(n1 , C), this embeds W ′ |(q(n0 )⊕q(n1 ))0 into a
sum of tensor powers of the natural representation, so that this representation
of gl(n0 , C) ⊕ gl(n1 , C) can be integrated to a polynomial representation θW ′ of
GL(n0 , C) × GL(n1 , C). Let Ch[W ′ ] denote the character of θW ′ , namely

                Ch[W ′ ](x1 , x2 , . . . , xn0 , y1 · · · , yn1 )
                = tr θW ′ (diag(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn0 ), diag(y1 , y2 , . . . , yn1 )).

  The following theorem determines the supercentralizer of Ψ(B̂k ) in End(W ) and
                                       .
describes the characters of simple Un0 ⊗ Un1 -modules appearing in W .
                                                                              .
Theorem 4.1. (1) The two superalgebras Ψ(B̂k ) and Un0 ⊗ Un1 act on W as the
mutual supercentralizers of each other:
                                                                                    .

   (2) The simple B̂k -module Wλ,µ ((λ, µ) ∈ (DP 2 )k ) occurs in W if and only if
l(λ) ≤ n0 and l(µ) ≤ n1 . Moreover we have

where Uλ,µ denotes a simple Un0 ⊗ Un1 -module.
                                   .
   (3) We have Uλ,µ ∼=Un ⊗U.
                             n1
                                Uλ ◦Uµ , where Uλ (resp. Uµ ) denotes the simple Un0
                         0
(resp. Un0 )-module corresponding to the simple B|λ| (resp. B|µ| )-module Wλ (resp.
Wµ ) in Sergeev’s duality (cf. Theorem A).
   (4) The character values of Ch[Uλ,µ ] are given as follows :

(4.6)
         Ch[Uλ,µ ](x1 , x2 , . . . , xn0 , y1 , y2 , . . . , yn1 )
                 √
             = ( 2)d(λ,µ)−l(λ)−l(µ) Qλ (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn0 )Qµ (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn1 )

where d : (DP 2 )k → Z2 denotes a map defined by d(λ, µ) = 0 (resp. d(λ, µ) = 1) if
l(λ) + l(µ) is even (resp. l(λ) + l(µ) is odd).
Proof. First we will show the second equality of (4.4). Then the first equality
also follows from the double supercentralizer theorem (abbreviated as DSCT) for
semisimple superalgebras (cf. [11, Th. 2.1]).
                                                           .                 .
   By Theorem A, (1), we have End·Ψ(ϑ(Bk )) (W ) ⊃ Θ(Un0 ⊗Un1 ), since Θ(Un0 ⊗Un1 )
is a subsuperalgebra of Θ(Un ). Hence Θ(X ⊗ Y ) commutes with Ψ(ϑ(Bk )) for any
X ∈ q(n0 ), Y ∈ q(n1 ). By direct calculations, it can be shown that Θ(X ⊗ Y ) and
                                                     7
Ψ(1⊗τ ′ ) also commute. Since B̂k is generated as an algebra by the ϑ(τi ), 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
                                                                          .
the ϑ(σj ), 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1, and 1 ⊗ τ ′ , we have End·Ψ(B̂k ) (W ) ⊃ Θ(Un0 ⊗ Un1 ). We
need only to show that
                                                            .
(4.7)                          End·Ψ(B̂k ) (W ) ⊂ Θ(Un0 ⊗ Un1 ).

We have End·Ψ(B̂k ) (W ) ⊂ End·Ψ(ϑ(Bk )) (W ) = Θ(Un ) by Theorem A, (1). It can be
easily checked that Θ(Un ) ⊂ Q(n) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Q(n), where Q(n) denotes the underlying
vectorspace of q(n) (or the superalgebra it forms), so that we have End·Ψ(B̂k ) (W ) ⊂

and X + QXQ belongs to Q(n0 ) ⊕ Q(n1 ) for any X ∈ Q(n), we have

        T (Q(n) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Q(n)) ⊂ (Q(n0 ) ⊕ Q(n1 )) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (Q(n0 ) ⊕ Q(n1 )).

Hence it follows that

    Next we will show (2) and (3) simultaneously. Since V is a sum of the natural
representations X and Y of q(n0 ) and q(n1 ) respectively: V = X ⊕ Y , where
dim X = (n0 , n0 ), dim Y = (n1 , n1 ), W can be decomposed into a sum of tensor

condition forces this simple B̂k -module to be isomorphic to Wλ,µ . Consequently,
the result (2) and (3) follow.

pε : Θ(Un0 ⊗ Un1 ) → Θ(Un0 ⊗ Un1 )|W ε by pε (f ) = f |W ε for f ∈ Θ(Un0 ⊗ Un1 ). It is
clear that pε is surjective. We claim that pε is injective. Assume that f ∈ ker pε ,
namely f |W ε = 0 ∈ End(W ε ). Since f and the ξ2j−1 commute, and a subgroup
                                                                                ′

follows:
                 ξ2j−1 W (ε1 ,...,εr ) = W (ε1 ,...,εj +1,...,εr ) (1 ≤∀ j ≤ r)
it follows that f |W ε′ = 0 for all ε′ ∈ Zr2 . Therefore f = 0 in End(W ). Hence pε

follows that Θ(Un0 ⊗ Un1 )|W ε = End·Ψ(Bk′ ) (W ε ), as required.

   The supercentralizer End·Ψ(Bk′ ) (W ε ) contains an invertible element Ψ(ξk )∈Ψ(Ck ).
The subsuperalgebra of End·Ψ(Bk′ ) (W ε ) generated by Ψ(ξk ) is isomorphic to C1 . By
the arguments similar to the proof of (4.10), the result (4.11) follows from DSCT

   Let us mention a relation between the branching rule of the q(n)-modules to
q(n0 ) ⊕ q(n1 ) and that of the B̂k -modules to Bk (or that of the Bk′ -modules to Ak ).
   If an A-module V restricts to an B-module, we write V ↓A    B for this B-module, for
a superalgebra A and a subsuperalgebra B of A. Moreover, we write [V : U ]A (or
simply write [V : U ]) for the multiplicity of a simple A-module U in an A-module
V.

   Let Hk′ be the subgroup of (Bk′ )× generated by −1, τ ′ , γ1 , . . . , γk−1 . Then Hk′ is

pν (x1 , x2 , . . . , −y1 , −y2 , . . . ) and Ch[Vλ,µ ] denotes the character of Vλ,µ , namely
Ch[Vλ,µ ](w) = tr(wVλ,µ ) for w ∈ Bk′ where wVλ,µ denotes the action of w ∈ Bk′ on

Proof. By what we noted before Theorem 4.1, any Bk′ ⊗ (Un0 ⊗ Un1 )-submodule W ′
of W can be regarded as a Bk′ -module with a commuting polynomial representation
θW ′ of GL(n0 , C) × GL(n1 , C). Here we extend our notation in Theorem 4.1 to let
Ch[W ′ ](x ⊗ g) denote the trace tr(xW ′ ◦ θW ′ (g)) for x ∈ Bk′ and g ∈ GL(n0 , C) ×
GL(n1 , C), where xW ′ denotes the action of x ∈ Bk′ on W ′ .

                                                  k
and E = diag(x1 , . . . , xn0 , y1 , . . . , yn1 ) ∈ GL(n, C), we have

(4.16)                Ch[W ε ] (wκ,ν ⊗ E) = 2−r Ch[W ] ((1 ⊗ wκ,ν ) ⊗ E)
                               .
where 1 ⊗ wκ,ν ∈ Ck ⊗ Bk′ = B̂k . We calculate the right hand side using the
embedding ϑ : Bk ֒→ B̂k (cf. (3.3)), namely 1⊗γj = ϑ( √12 (τj −τj+1 )σj ). Put k′ = |κ|
                                                                           ′                       ′
and l = l(κ). Then k − k′ = |ν|. Moreover put W ′ = V ⊗k and W ′′ = V ⊗k−k . We
                                                     ′
have wκ,ν = wκ,φ wφ,ν , where wκ,φ ∈ Bk′ ′ , wφ,ν ∈ Bk−k ′ . Define a representations

The element 1 ⊗ wκ,φ of B̂k′ is a product of k′ − l elements 1 ⊗ γj = ϑ( √12 (τj −
τj+1 )σj ). This product can be rearranged into the following form:

     (constant) × (a product of the ϑ(τp ) − ϑ(τq )) × (a product of the ϑ(σj )).

The product of the ϑ(σj ) equals ϑ(σ κ,φ ). Expanding the product of ϑ(τp ) − ϑ(τq )
                ′
into a sum of 2k −l elements, we have
                                           k′ −l

Then all terms in the summation are conjugate to ϑ(σ κ,φ ) in ϑ((Bk )× ). Therefore
we have

On the other hand, by (4.6) and (4.9), if k is even, then we have

Since these hold for all n0 and n1 , the result follows.                         
    We review Stembridge’s formula for the character values of simple Bk′ -modules
, in a form adapted to the simple modules in the Z2 -graded sense.
Theorem 4.5. (cf. [10, Lem. 7.5]) We have

                       (λ,µ)∈(DP 2 )k


for all (κ, ν) ∈ (OP 2 )k , where Qλ (x, y) = Qλ (x1 , x2 , . . . , y1 , y2 , . . . ) and Qµ (x, −y)
= Qµ (x1 , x2 , . . . , −y1 , −y2 , . . . ).
   The formula (4.15) is different from Stembridge’s formula. Let us mention a
relationship between the two formulas. Define an algebra endomorphism ι of Ωx ⊗
Ωy by ι(f ⊗ 1) = f (x, y) = f (x1 , x2 , . . . , y1 , y2 , . . . ) and ι(1 ⊗ g) = g(x, −y) =
g(x1 , x2 , . . . , −y1 , −y2 , . . . ). Note that {Qλ (x, y)Qµ (x, −y) | (λ, µ) ∈ (DP 2 )} is a
basis of Ωx ⊗ Ωy (cf. [10, Th. 7.1, Lem. 7.5]). It follows that ι is an automorphism,
since ι(Qλ (x)Qµ (y)) = Qλ (x, y)Qµ (x, −y). Moreover, since ι(pr (x, y)) = 2pr (x)
and ι(pr (x, −y)) = 2pr (y) for any odd r, it follows that the image of (4.15) under
ι coincides with Stembridge’s formula.

A. Sergeev’s duality. We review Sergeev’s duality relation between Bk′ and Un
using DSCT. Define a map d : DPk → Z2 by d(λ) = 0 (resp. d(λ) = 1) if l(λ) is
even (resp. l(λ) is odd).

Theorem A. [8] (1) The two superalgebras Ψ(Bk ) and Un act on W as mutual
supercentralizers of each other:

(A.1)           End·Θ(Un ) (W ) = Ψ(Bk ),           End·Ψ(Bk ) (W ) = Θ(Un ).

  (2) The simple Bk -module Wλ (λ ∈ DPk ) occurs in W if and only if l(λ)) ≤ n.
Then we have
                                                M            .

                                              l(λ)≤n


where Uλ denotes a simple Un -module corresponding to Wλ in W in the sense of
DSCT.
  (3) The character values of Ch[Uλ ] are given as follows:
                                              √
(A.3)       Ch[Uλ ](x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = ( 2)d(λ)−l(λ) Qλ (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ).


B. A duality of Ak and q(n).. We established a duality relation between Ak
and Un on the same space W ε as in Theorem 4.2.

Theorem B. [11, Th. 4.1] The submodule W ε is decomposed as a multiplicity-free
                 .
sum of simple Ak ⊗ Un -modules as follows:

   (1) Assume that k is even. Then the simple Ak ⊗ Un -modules Vλ ◦ Uλ in W ε are
of type M . Furthermore we have

(B.2)         End·Θ(Un ) (W ε ) = Ψ(Ak ),           End·Ψ(Ak ) (W ε ) = Θ(Un ).

   (2) Assume that k is odd. Then the simple Ak ⊗ Un -modules Vλ ◦ Uλ in W ε are
of type Q. Furthermore we have

(B.3)       End·Θ(Un ) (W ε ) ∼
                              = C1 ⊗ Ψ(Ak ),          End·Ψ(Ak ) (W ε ) ∼
