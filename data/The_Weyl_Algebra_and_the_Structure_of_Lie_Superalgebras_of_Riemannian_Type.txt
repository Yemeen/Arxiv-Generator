                                                                                  0. Introduction


                                                 0.1. All vector spaces are over C and are assumed to be finite dimensional unless
                                             manifestly otherwise (e.g., tensor algebras, Weyl algebras, symmetric algebras, universal
                                             enveloping algebras of Lie algebras). A bilinear form (u, v) on a Z2 -graded vector space V =
                                             V0 + V1 will be called here supersymmetric in case (x, y) = (−1)|x||y| (y, x) for homogeneous

                                             elements x, y ∈ V and the even component V0 is orthogonal to the odd component V1 . In
                                             case V = g is a Lie superalgebra with g0 = V0 and V1 = g1 , such a bilinear form, now
                                             denoted by Bg , will be called super-Riemannian in case Bg is non-singular and ad-invariant.
                                             In such a case Bg0 = Bg |g0 is non-singular, symmetric (in the usual sense) and ad-invariant

                                             for the ordinary Lie algebra g0 . Also Bg1 = Bg |g1 is non-singular and alternating in the
                                             usual sense. Furthermore if Sp(g1 ) ⊂ Aut g1 is the symplectic group with respect to Bg1 ,
                                             then one has a representation

                                                                                 ν : g0 → Lie Sp(g1 )                                (0.1)


                                             where for x ∈ g0 , y ∈ g1 , one has ν(x)y = [x, y]. A Lie superalgebra which admits a

                                             super-Riemannian bilinear form will be said to be of Riemannian type.


                                                 Examples.

                                              [1] In his classification of all simple Lie superalgebras Victor Kac (see [Kac]) isolated a
                                                 subfamily which he referred to as basic classical Lie superalgebras. These are all of

                                               * Research supported in part by NSF grant DMS-9625941 and in part by the
                                             KG&G Foundation

                                                                                          1
    Riemannian type. Besides ordinary simple Lie algebras they list as A(m, n), B(m, n),
    C(n), D(m, n), D(2, 1, α), F (4), and G(3).
 [2] If s is any Lie superalgebra and s∗ is its dual we may form the semi-direct sum
    g = s ⊕ s∗ with s operating on s∗ by the coadjoint representation and with s∗ taken

    to be abelian. Then g has the structure of a Lie superalgebra of Riemannian type.


    0.2. Let v be a vector space with a non-singular alternating bilinear form Bv and

let Sp(v) be the symplectic group of v with respect to Bv . Let g0 be an (ordinary) Lie
algebra which admits a non-singular symmetric bilinear form Bg0 . Assume one has a
representation
                                    ν : g0 → Lie Sp(v)                                 (0.2)

As noted in (0.1) such a representation arises from a Lie superalgebra of Riemannian type.
The main theorem (Theorem 0.1 below) gives a necessary and sufficient condition, purely
in terms of the symplectic representation ν, that (0.2) be of the form (0.1).

    Let W (v) be the Weyl algebra over v (with respect to Bv ) so that W (v) is the free
algebra over v subject to the relations u v − v u = 2(u, v) for all u, v ∈ v. Let S(v) =
P∞      n
   n=0 S (v) be the symmetric algebra over v. The bilinear form Bv on v extends in a

natural way to a non-singular bilinear form BS(v) on S(v). There is a natural identification

of the underlying spaces of W (v) and S(v) so that we will understand that W (v) has two
multiplicative structures. The identification is such that un for u ∈ v and n ∈ Z+ has the
same meaning in both structures. The Weyl product of w, z ∈ W (v) is denoted by w z
and the product in S(v) will be denoted by w · z. Commutation using Weyl multiplication

defines a Lie algebra structure on S 2 (v) and a Lie algebra isomorphism

                                    S 2 (v) → Lie Sp(v)                                (0.3)

The representation ν then uniquely lifts to a Lie algebra homomorphism

                                      ν∗ : g0 → S 2 (v)                                (0.4)

                                             2
so that ν∗ composed with the isomorphism (0.3) is ν. With respect to the bilinear forms
Bg0 and BS(v) |S 2 (v) the map ν∗ admits a transpose


                                        ν∗t : S 2 (v) → g0                                (0.5)


Now let U (g0 ) be the universal enveloping algebra of g0 . The Lie algebra homomorphism
(0.4) then extends uniquely to an algebra homomorphism


                                     ν∗ : U (g0 ) → W (v)                                 (0.6)


Let xi , i = 1, . . . , k, be an orthonormal basis of g0 with respect to Bg0 . The Casimir
                                                                            Pk
element Casg0 ∈ Cent U (g0 ) corresponding to Bg0 is given by Casg0 = i=0 x2i . If we
identify S 0 (v) with C one readily shows that


                                   ν∗ (Casg0 ) ∈ S 4 (v) + C                              (0.7)


     Now let g = g0 ⊕v. Regarding g as a Z2 -graded vector space with g0 and v respectively
as the even and odd components, let Bg be the non-singular supersymmetric bilinear form
on g defined so that Bg |g0 = Bg0 and Bg |v = Bv . We will now say that the pair (ν, Bg)

is of super Lie type in case there is a Lie superalgebra structure on g so that (1) g0 , as
a Lie algebra, is the even component of g, (2) v = g1 , and for any x ∈ g0 , y ∈ v one has
[x, y] = ν(x)y, and (3) Bg is a super-Riemannian bilinear form on g (so that in particular
g is of Riemannian type). The following main theorem is proved as Theorem 2.8 in §2.


     Theorem 0.1. Let the pair (ν, Bg), as above, be arbitrary. Then (ν, Bg) is of super
Lie type if and only if ν∗ (Casg0 ) is a constant. That is, in the notation of (0.7), (ν, Bg) is

of super Lie type if and only if the component of ν∗ (Casg0 ) in S 4 (v) vanishes. Furthermore
in such a case the Lie superalgebra structure on g is unique. In fact for y, y ′ ∈ v the element
[y, y ′ ] ∈ g0 is given by

                                      [y, y ′] = 2 ν∗t (y · y ′ )                         (0.8)

                                                  3
    Remark 0.2. We may restate Theorem 0.1 in the language of representation theory.

Recall that v is even dimensional, say dim v = 2m. Then if Dif fpoly Cm is the algebra of all
differential operators on Cm with polynomial coefficients one has an algebra isomorphism

                                   W (v) → Dif fpoly Cm                                 (0.9)

If we compose (0.9) with (0.6) one has a homomorphism

                                   U (g0 ) → Dif fpoly Cm                             (0.10)

The statement of Theorem 0.1 is that (ν, Bg) is of super Lie type if and only if the image
of the Casimir element Casg0 in (0.10) is just multiplication by a constant.


    0.3. The statement of Theorem 0.1 was suggested to us by an analogous statement for
ordinary Lie algebras which we proved some time ago. If g is an ordinary Lie algebra with

a non-singular ad-invariant symmetric bilinear form Bg and k ⊂ g is a Lie subalgebra
such that Bk = Bg |k, is non-singular let p be the Bg orthocomplement of k in g and let
Bp = Bg |p. Let SO(p) be the orthogonal group with respect to Bp . The relation [k, p] ⊂ p
defines a representation

                                     ν : k → Lie SO(p)                                (0.11)

One question we considered and solved in the early 1960’s was to characterize the case
where k is a symmetric subalgebra of g (i.e., the case where [p, p] ⊂ k) purely in terms
of the representation ν. The characterization is the analogue of Theorem 0.1 where the
Clifford algebra Clif f (p) replaces the Weyl algebra W (v) and the exterior algebra ∧p

replaces the symmetric algebra S(v). The condition is again that ν∗ (Cask ) be a constant.
For the statement see p.152 in [Con]. For the proof see Theorem 1.59 in [Kos].


    Remark 0.3. The constancy of ν∗ (Cask ) in case rank k = rank g was used by
Parthasarathy to construct discrete series representations. See Lemma 2.2 in [Parth]. One

                                             4
is left to wonder whether Theorem 0.1 will have analogous applications for representations
of Lie superalgebras of Riemannian type.


                                  1. Lie superalgebras


    1.1. If
                                          V = V0 + V1

is a Z2 -graded vector space and v ∈ V , then the use of the notation |v| implicitly
assumes that v is homogeneous and |v| = 0 or 1 according as v is even, i.e., v ∈ V0
or odd, i.e., v ∈ V1 . If i, j ∈ {0, 1} represent homogeneity indices in Z2 -graded vector

spaces then i + j is taken in Z2 . A Z2 -graded vector space g = g0 + g1 is a Lie
superalgebra if the there is a bilinear operation [x, y] on g, where

                                        [gi , gj ] ⊂ gi+j                                   (1.1)

such that for x, y, z ∈ g

          (A) [x, y] = −(−1)|x||y| [y, x] and

         (B) (−1)|x||z| [x, [y, z]] + (−1)|z||y| [z, [x, y]] + (−1)|y||x| [y, [z, x]] = 0

One readily shows that (A) and (B) are equivalent to (A) and (B ′ ) where (B ′ ) is the
super derivation condition

                         [x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] + (−1)|x||y| [y, [x, z]]                 (1.2)

If V is a Z2 -graded vector space then End V has the structure of a Lie superalgebra
where for a ∈ End V and v ∈ V one has |av| = |a| + |v| and for a, b ∈ End V one has
[a, b] = ab − (−1)|a||b| ba. If g is Lie superalgebra then a super representation of g on V
is a homomorphism π : g → End V of Lie superalgebras which preserves the grading.

    Let g be a Lie superalgebra and consider the linear map

                  ad : g → End g, where for x, y ∈ g, ad x(y) = [x, y]

                                                 5
Then one readily verifies


    Remark 1.1. The map ad is a super representation of g on itself (referred to as

the adjoint representation). It follows from (1.1) and (1.2) that the restriction of the
bracket operation to g0 defines an ordinary Lie algebra structure on g0 and for x ∈ g0
the map
              x 7→ ad x|g1 defines an ordinary representation of g0 on g1            (1.3)


    1.2. Let V be a Z2 -graded vector space. The value taken on an ordered pair
u, v ∈ V by a bilinear form B on V will be denoted by (u, v) if there is no danger of
confusion. A bilinear form B on V will be said to be supersymmetric if
              (α) (u, v) = (−1)|u||v| (v, u), for all homogeneous u, v ∈ V
                                                                                     (1.4)
              (β) (Vi , Vj ) = 0 if i 6= j
If π is a representation of a Lie superalgebra g on V then we will say that B is invariant
under π (or g if π is understood) in case

                            (π(x)u, v) + (−1)|x||u| (u, π(x)v) = 0                   (1.5)

for all v ∈ V, and homogeneous x ∈ g, u ∈ V .
    Let V be a Z2 -graded vector space. The dual space V ∗ to V has an obvious
Z2 -grading. For v ∈ V and w ∈ V ∗ we will denote the pairing of w and v into C by

hw, vi. If a ∈ End V then at ∈ EndV ∗ is defined so that hat w, vi = hw, avi for any
v ∈ V and any w ∈ V ∗ . One readily shows that if π is a super representation of a Lie
superalgebra on V , then π ∗ is a super representation of g on V ∗ (referred to as the
representation contragredient to π) where for homogeneous x ∈ g and homogeneous

w ∈ V ∗ one has
                               π ∗ (x)w = −(−1)|x||w| π(x)t w                        (1.6)


    Remark 1.2. Note that it is immediate from (1.5) and (1.6) that if V is finite
dimensional and B is a non-singular π-invariant supersymmetric bilinear form on V

                                              6
then the linear isomorphism ξ : V → V ∗ defines a representation equivalence of π and
π ∗ , where for any u, v ∈ V one has hξu, vi = (u, v).


     1.3. Let V be a finite dimensional Z2 -graded vector space. The supertrace on
End V is a linear map

                                    str : End V → C                             (1.7)

defined so that str a = 0 if a ∈ (End V )1 and for a ∈ (End V )0 one has


                                str a = tr a|V0 − tr a|V1


Regarding C as a 1-dimensional Lie algebra (and hence a fortiori a Lie superalgebra)
one readily shows that (1.7) is a homomorphism of Lie superalgebras. In particular
for a, b ∈ End V ,
                             str [a, b] = str ab − (−1)|a||b| ba
                                                                                (1.8)
                                      =0
But for a, b, c ∈ End V one has


                            [a, bc] = [a, b]c + (−1)|a||b| b[a, c]              (1.9)


Let BEnd V be the bilinear form on End V defined by putting (b, c) = str bc. It is
trivial to see that BEnd V is non-singular. As a consequence of (1.8) and (1.9) one
then recovers the well-known


     Proposition 1.3. Let V be a finite dimensional Z2 -graded vector space. Then
BEnd V is a non-singular supersymmetric bilinear form on the Lie superalgebra End V .

Furthermore BEnd V is invariant under the (super) adjoint representation of End V
on itself.


     In the terminology of the introduction, which shall be retained from now on,
End V (wth the bracket structure defined above) is a Lie superalgebra of Riemannian

                                              7
type and BEnd V is a super-Riemannian bilinear form on End V . But now if π : g →
End V is any super representation of a Lie superalgebra on a Z2 -graded vector space
V then BEnd V , by Proposition 1.3, induces a supersymmetric bilinear form Bπ on g
given by

                                 (x, y) = str π(x)π(y)                            (1.10)

which is invariant under the adjoint representation of g. If π is the adjoint represen-
tation of g, then one will refer to Bad as the super Killing form.

    Now if g is any Lie superalgebra let


                                    ν : g0 → End g1                               (1.11)


be the representation of the ordinary Lie algebra g0 on the vector space g1 given by

ν(x)y = [x, y] for x ∈ g0 and y ∈ g1 . In this paper the main result will give the struc-
ture of an arbitrary Lie superalgebra g of Riemannian type. The structure theorem
will depend only on the ordinary Lie algebra g0 and a special property of a vector
space representation ν of g0 . The following are a few examples of Lie superalgebras

of Riemannian type.


    Examples.

(1) The Kac list of basic classical Lie superalgebras (see Introduction, §0.1). One

    notes that, for the case (i.e., Am,n ) of Proposition 1.1, if dim V0 = dim V1 then
    even though BEnd V is non-singular, the super Killing form is identically 0.

(2) Let B be any adjoint invariant, supersymmetric bilinear form on a Lie super-
    algebra g. For example take B = Bπ in the notation of (1.10). Let rad B be
    the radical of B so that rad B is a Lie superideal of g. Then g/rad B is a Lie
    superalgebra of Riemannian type and B ′ is a super-Riemannian bilinear form on

    g/rad B where B ′ is the bilinear form on g/rad B induced by B. One notes that
    if g is simple either rad B = 0 or rad B = g.

                                           8
(3) Let s be any finite dimensional Lie superalgebra. The coadjoint representation,
    coad, of s is the representation of s on the dual space s∗ to s, which is contra-
    gredient to ad. Let g = s ⊕ s∗ . One defines a Lie superalgebra structure on g so
    that s is a subalgebra, [s∗ , s∗ ] = 0, and [x, y] = coad x(y) for x ∈ s and y ∈ s∗ .

    In such a case put [y, x] = −(−1)|x||y| [x, y]. One defines a bilinear form Bg on g
    so that s and s∗ are isotropic subspaces and (y, x) = hy, xi for y ∈ s∗ and x ∈ s.
    In such a case one puts (x, y) = (−1)|x||y| (y, x). It is readily verified that Bg is a
    super-Riemannian bilinear form on g.


                  2. The Weyl algebra and the main theorem


    2.1. Let v be an even dimensional vector space and let Bv be a non-singular
alternating bilinear form (u, v) on v. Let T (v) be the tensor algebra over v. Let IW (v)
(resp. IS (v)) be the ideal in T (v) generated by all elements of the form u ⊗ v − v ⊗ u −
2(u, v) (resp. u ⊗ v − v ⊗ u) for u, v ∈ v. The Weyl algebra W (v) = T (v)/IW (v) (resp.

the symmetric algebra S(v) = T (v)/IS (v)) and one has a quotient homomorphism
σW : T (v) → W (v) (resp. σS : T (v) → S(v)). We may identify v with σW (v) and
with σS (v) so that S(v) is the commutative free algebra generated by v and Wv is the
algebra generated by v where one has the relation

                                   uv − vu = 2(u, v)                                 (2.1)

for u, v ∈ v. If DT is a derivation of T (v) which stabilizes both IW (v) and IS (v) then

DT descends to a derivation DW of W (v) and a derivation DS of S(v). We consider
two examples. Let Sp(v) ⊂ Aut v be the Lie algebra of the symplectic group with
respect to Bv . If α ∈ Lie Sp(v) then α extends uniquely to a derivation τT (α) of T (v).
The extension clearly stabilizes both IW (v) and IS (v) so that α uniquely extends to the

derivations τW (α) and τS (α) of W (v) and S(v), respectively. The symmetric algebra
S(v) is of course graded and τS (α) clearly stabilizes the homogeneous components

                                            9
S k (v), k = 0, 1, ...,. For the second example one notes that if u ∈ v, the unique
derivation ιT (u) (of degreee −1) of T (v) such that ιT (u)v = (u, v) stabilizes both
IW (v) and IS (v) and hence descends to derivations ιW (u) and ιS (v) of W (v) and
S(v), respectively.

     One naturally extends the bilinear form Bv on v to a non-singular bilinear form
BS(v) on S(v) so that S m (v) is orthogonal to S n (v) for m 6= n and if ui , vj ∈ v for
i, j = 1, . . . , n, then

                                                             X
                            (u1 · · · un , v1 · · · vn ) =        (u1 , vσ1 ) · · · (un , vσn )   (2.2)
                                                              σ

where the sum is over the permutation group of {1, . . . , n}.


     Remark 2.1. Note that BS(v) is symmetric on S n (v) if n is even and alternating
on S n (v) if n is odd.


     For each u ∈ v let εS (u) be the linear operator on S(v) of multiplication by u. It
is immediate from (2.2) that for any u ∈ v and w, z ∈ S(v) that


                                          (εS (u)w, z) = (w, ιS (u)z)                             (2.3)


Also for u, v ∈ v one readily has that the commutation relations

                                        [iS (u), εS (v)] = [εS (u), ιS (v)]
                                                                                                  (2.4)
                                                             = (u, v)

It follows therefore that if γ(u) = εS (u) + ιS (u), then for u, v ∈ v one has


                                             [γ(u), γ(v)] = 2(u, v)                               (2.5)


The linear map v → End S(v) where u 7→ γ(u) naturally extends to a homomorphism
T (v) → End S(v) which, by (2.5), descends to a homomorphism


                                             γ : W (v) → End S(v)                                 (2.6)

defining the structure of a W (v)-module on S(v). Now let η : W (v) → S(v) be the
linear map defined by putting
                                    η(w) = γ(w)1                                   (2.7)

Let Σ(v) ⊂ T (v) be the space of symmetric tensors. Clearly σW : Σ(v) → W (v) and

σS : Σ(v) → S(v) are linear isomorphisms. If u ∈ v then since (u, u) = 0, it follows
easily that η is a linear isomorphism since one clearly has, for any n ∈ Z+ ,


                                     η(un ) = u[n]                                 (2.8)


where, to avoid confusion, we have written un and u[n] , respectively, for the nth power
of u in W (v) and S(v). Henceforth we will identify W (v) with S(v), using η, and
understand that there are two multiplications on W (v), Weyl multplication, wz, and

the commutative multiplication of S(v) denoted now by w · z.


    Proposition 2.2. Let u ∈ v. Then ιW (u) = ιS (u) so that if we put ι(u) =

ιW (u) = ιS (u) then ι(u) is a derivation of both the Weyl and symmetric algebra
structures on W (v).
    Let α ∈ Lie Sp(v). Then τW (α) = τS (α) so that if we put τ (α) = τW (α) = τS (α)
then τ (α) is a derivation of both the Weyl and symmetric algebra structures on W (v).


    Proof. It follows from (2.8) that


                                      η σW = σS                                    (2.9)


on the subspace Σ(v) ⊂ T (v) of symmetric tensors. But then the proposition is a
consequence of (2.9) since ιT (u) and τT (α) stabilize Σ(v). Indeed if DT , DW and DS

are as in the beginning of §2.1 then DW σW = σW DT and DS σS = σS DT on T (v).
But if DT stabilizes Σ(v) then (2.9) implies


                                  η σW DT = σS DT

on Σ(v). Hence on Σ(v),
                                 η DW σW = DS σS

                                            = DS η σW
Thus

                                     η DW = DS η                              (2.10)

    2.2. For any element w ∈ S 2 (v) let ad w be the operator on W (v) defined so
that ad w(z) = [w, z] where z ∈ W (v) and commutation is with respect to Weyl

multiplication.


    Lemma 2.3. Let w ∈ S 2 (v). Then v = S 1 (v) is stable under ad w and if
v ∈ v, w ∈ S 2 (v) one has

                                  ad w(v) = −2 ι(v)w                          (2.11)

Furthermore ad w|v ∈ Lie Sp(v) and if u, v ∈ v one has


                              (u, ad w(v)) = −2ι(u)ι(v)w                      (2.12)



    Proof. Since S 2 (v) is clearly spanned by elements of the form t2 for t ∈ v to
prove (2.11) it suffices to take w = t2 . But then for v ∈ v

                                 −2ι(v)t2 = −4(v, t) t

                                           = 4(t, v) t

                                           = t2 v − v t2

This establishes (2.11). Now let u, v ∈ v. But then (2.12) follows from (2.11). How-
ever since ι(u) and ι(v) clearly commute (this follows for example from (2.3)) one

has (u, ad w(v)) = (v, ad w(u)). But of course (v, ad w(u)) = −(ad w(u), v) so that
ad w|v ∈ Lie Sp(v). QED

    Now let

                                A : S 2 (v) → Lie Sp(v)                           (2.13)


be the map defined by putting A(w) = (ad w)|v.


    Proposition 2.4. The subspace S 2 (v) ⊂ W (v) is a Lie algebra under Weyl
commutation. Moreover A is a Lie algebra isomorphism. In addition if w ∈ S 2 (v)

and α = A(w), then

                                      τ (α) = ad w                                (2.14)




    Proof. Let w ∈ S 2 (v) and let α = A(w) ∈ Lie Sp(v). Obviously ad w is a
derivation of W (v). But then ad w = τW (α) by definition of τW . Hence ad w = τ (α)

by Proposition 2.2. Consequently ad w = τS (α) so that S n (v) is stable under ad w for
all n ∈ Z+ . In particular this is the case for n = 2 so that S 2 (v) is a Lie subalgebra
of W (v). The Jacobi identity for commutation in W (v) then implies that A is a Lie
algebra homomorphism. The map A is injective by (2.12). It is then surjective by

dimension. QED


    Identify S 0 (v) with C. For any w ∈ W (v) let χ(w) ∈ C be the component

in S 0 (v) with respect to the graded structure on W (v) defined by the homogeneous

    Proposition 2.5. The bilinear form BS(v) on W (g) may be given by


                                     (y, z) = χ(y z)                              (2.15)

    Proof. Let y, z ∈ W (v). By (2.7)

                                   y z = γ(yz)1

                                       = γ(y)γ(z)1                               (2.16)

                                       = γ(y)z

By linearity, to prove (2.15) it suffices to take y = un , z = v m for u, v ∈ v and

n, m ∈ Z. But by (2.16)

                              y z = (εS (u) + ιS (v))n v m                       (2.17)

But then it is immediate from (2.17) that χ(y z) = 0 if n 6= m and if n = m, (2.17)

implies
                                 χ(y z) = (ιS (u))m v m

                                        = m!(u, v)m

                                        = (y, z)

This establishes (2.15). But now BS(v) is invariant under ad w for w ∈ S 2 (v) by
(2.15) since ad w derivates Weyl multiplication and, also, by (2.14), ad w preserves the
gradation of S(v). QED


    Clearly there exists a unique anti-automorphism JT of the tensor algebra T (v)
such that JT (u) = iu for any u ∈ v. One notes that JT fixes any element of the
form u ⊗ v − v ⊗ u − 2(u, v) where u, v ∈ v so that JT stabilizes the ideal IW (v).
Consequently JT descends to an anti-automorphism J of order 4 on the Weyl algebra

W (v) and equals the scalar i on v. Clearly then for any n ∈ Z+ ,


                                   J = in on S n (v)                             (2.18)


since S n (v) is spanned by all elements of the form un for u ∈ v. One notes then that
J 2 is an automorphism of order 2 on W (v) and


                                 J 2 = (−1)n on S n (v)                          (2.19)

Let W even (v) =     n=0   S 2n (v). Identify S 0 (v) with C.


       Proposition 2.6. W even is the (associative) subalgebra of W (v) generated by

S 2 (v). Furthermore for any w ∈ S 2 (v) one has

                                        w2 ∈ S 4 (v) + C                           (2.20)




       Proof. It is clear from (2.19) that W even (v) is the space of fixed elements for
the automorphism J 2 . Hence W even (v) is a subalgebra of W (v). However clearly
W even (v) is spanned by all elements of the form u2n = (u2 )n for all u ∈ v. Hence

W even (v) is generated by S 2 (v). But now it follows immediately from (2.16) and the
formula for γ(v) for v ∈ v that

                               (S 2 (v))2 ⊂ S 4 (v) + S 2 (v) + C                  (2.21)

We have only to show that if w ∈ S 2 (v), the component of w2 in S 2 (v) on the right side
of (2.21) vanishes. But J = −1 on S 2 (v) and J = 1 on S 4 (v) + C. But J(w2 ) = w2 .

Thus the component of w2 in S 2 (v) vanishes. QED


       2.3. Now assume that g0 is some (ordinary) Lie algebra with a nonsingular ad-

invariant symmetric bilinear form (x, y) denoted by Bg0 . Assume also that v is an
even dimensional vector space with a non-singular alternating bilinear form Bv and
that
                                      ν : g0 → Lie Sp(v)

is a symplectic representation (with respect to Bv ) of g0 on v.


       Remark 2.7. Note that one is presented with these assumptions in case g =

g0 + g1 is a Lie superalgebra of Riemannian type. In such a case let Bg be a super
Riemannian bilinear form on g. Indeed let Bg0 = Bg |g0 and Bg1 = Bg |g1 . Then the

                                               15
assumptions are satisfied where v = g1 , Bv = Bg1 and ν is the representation of g0 on
v defined as in (1.11).


    By Proposition 2.2 the Weyl algebra W (v) = S(v) (as linear spaces) then inherits

the structure of a g0 -module with respect to the action of τ (ν(x)) for x ∈ g0 . But, by
Proposition 2.4, ν uniquely “lifts” to a Lie algebra homomorphism


                                     ν∗ : g0 → S 2 (v)                             (2.22)


such that, by (2.14),

                                   ad ν∗ (x) = τ (ν(x))                            (2.23)

for any x ∈ g0 . With respect to the bilinear forms BS(v) |S 2 (v) and Bg0 the map ν∗

admits a transpose

                                     ν∗t : S 2 (v) → g0                            (2.24)

so that for any x ∈ g0 and w ∈ S 2 (v) one has

The spaces g0 and S 2 (v) are g0 -modules respectively with respect to ad and ad ν∗ (x).


    Proposition 2.7. Both ν∗ and its transpose ν∗t are g0 -maps.


    Proof. Clearly ν∗ is a g0 -map since ν∗ is a Lie algebra homomorphism. But
then ν∗t is a g0 -map since Bg0 is, of course, g0 -invariant and BS(v) is g0 -invariant by

Proposition 2.5. QED

to Bg0 . Consider the Casimir element Casg0 = i=1 x2i . Of course Casg0 is in the
center Z(g0 ) of U (g0 ). We will be particularly interested in ν∗ (Casg0 ). By (2.20) one
has

      2.4. We retain the assumptions and notation of §2.3 so that g0 is an arbitrary
(ordinary) Lie algebra which admits a non-singular ad-invariant symmetric bilinear

form Bg0 . Also v is an even dimensional vector space with a non-singular alternating
bilinear form Bv and

                                   ν : g0 → Lie Sp(v)

is a symplectic representation (with respect to Bv ) of g0 on v. Recalling Remark 2.7

our main theorem will be a condition on ν which characterizes the case when the
assumptions arise from a Lie superalgebra of Riemannian type.

      Let g = g0 ⊕ v and regard g as a Z2 -graded vector space where g0 and v

are respectively the even and odd components of g. Let Bg be the non-singular
supersymmetric bilinear form on g defined so that g0 and v are orthogonal and
Bg |g0 = Bg0 , Bg |v = Bv . We will say that the pair (ν, Bg) is of super Lie type
in case there exists a Lie superalgebra structure on g such that (1) g0 is the even

component, v = g1 is the odd component, [x, y] = ν(x)y for any x ∈ g0 , y ∈ v and (2)
Bg0 is ad-invariant.


      Theorem 2.8. Let (ν, Bg) be arbitrary. Then (ν, Bg ) is of super Lie type if and
only if ν∗ (Casg0 ) is a constant in the Weyl algebra W (v). That is, (ν, Bg) is of super
Lie type if and only if, in the notation of (2.27), the component of ν∗ (Casg0 ) in S 4 (v)

vanishes. Furthermore the Lie superalgebra structure on g is unique. In fact for any
y, y ′ ∈ v one has

                                   [y, y ′ ] = 2ν∗t (y · y ′ )                      (2.28)

                                              17
where we recall y · y ′ ∈ S 2 (v) is the (commutative) product of y and y ′ in S(v) and
[y, y ′ ] ∈ g0 is the supercommutator in g (and is not commutation in W (v)). In addition
g is a Lie superalgebra of Riemannian type and Bg is a super-Riemannian bilinear form
on g.


     Proof. Assume first that (ν, Bg ) is of super Lie type and let [y, z] be the bracket
in the Lie superalgebra g. We will show (2.28) is necessarily satisfied. Let y, y ′ ∈ v

and let x ∈ g0 . Then by (2.3), (2.11) and (2.23) one has

                              ([y, y ′], x) = −(y ′ , [x, y])

                                           = 2(y ′ , ι(y)ν∗ (x))
                                                                                    (2.29)
                                           = 2(y · y ′ , ν∗ (x))

                                           = 2(ν∗t (y · y ′ ), x)

But this establishes (2.28) since x ∈ g0 is arbitrary and Bg0 is non-singular.

     Now assume (ν, Bg ) is arbitrary. We will define a bracket [y, z] in g which will
clearly satisfy
                                 [y, z] = −(−1)|y||z| [z, y]                        (2.30)

Let [y, z] be the bracket in g0 if y, z ∈ g0 . Let [y, z] = −[z, y] = ν(y)z if y ∈ g0 and

z ∈ v. Let [y, z] = 2ν∗t (y · z) if y, z ∈ v. Now for any x ∈ g let a(x) ∈ End g be defined
so that a(x)y = [x, y] for any y ∈ g. We next show that Bg is invariant under a(x)
any x ∈ g. That is, for homogeneous x, y, z ∈ g one has

                            ([x, y], z) = −(−1)|x||y| (y, [x, z])                   (2.31)

If x ∈ g0 then both sides vanish if y and z have unequal degrees. But one has
(2.31) for y, z ∈ g0 since Bg0 is ad-invariant and one has (2.30) for y, z ∈ v since
ν(x) ∈ Lie Sp(v). Next assume x ∈ v. Then both sides of (2.31) vanish if y and z

have the same degrees. By reversing sides it suffices only to consider only one of the
remaining 2 cases. Namely it suffices to consider the case where y ∈ v and z ∈ v.

                                              18
But then (2.31) follows from a reverse of the argument in (2.29). That is going from
bottom to the top. This establishes (2.31).

     We now determine to what extent the super Jacobi identity


                           [x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] + (−1)|x||y| [y, [x, z]]                     (2.32)


is already satisfied. Of course (2.32) is satisfied in case x, y, z ∈ g0 . In case 2 of the

3 elements x, y, z are in g0 , then (2.32) is also satisfied since ν is a representation.
But (2.32) is also satisfied if only one of the elements x, y, z lies in g0 . To prove this
it suffices only to consider the case where x ∈ g0 and y, z ∈ v. The fact that this
case is sufficient uses (2.30) which holds for all homogeneous pairs x, y in g. But by

Proposition 2.2, (2.23) and Proposition 2.7

                               [x, [y, z]] = 2[x, ν∗t (y · z)]

                                             = 2ν∗t (ad ν∗ (x)(y · z))

                                             = 2ν∗t ([x, y] · z + y · [x, z])

                                             = [[x, y], z] + [y, [x, z]]

This establishes (2.32). The final case to be considered is when the three elements are
in v. Recalling (B) in §1.1 we will have established that (ν, Bg ) is of super Lie type if

and only if for all y, y ′ , y ′′ ∈ v one has


                           [y, [y ′, y ′′ ]] + [y ′ , [y ′′ , y]] + [y, [y ′ , y ′′ ]] = 0        (2.33)


Let y, y ′ , y ′′ ∈ v. Let w ∈ S 2 (v) and y, y ′ , y ′′ ∈ v. Then by Proposition 2.2

               ι(y ′ )ι(y)w2 = ι(y ′ )((ι(y)w) w + w ι(y)w)
                                                                                                  (2.34)
                              = 2(ι(y ′ ) ι(y)w) w + ι(y)w ι(y ′ )w + ι(y ′ )w ι(y)w

But ι(u)ι(v)w = (u · v, w) by (2.3). Hence applying ι(y ′′ ) to (2.34) yields


  ι(y ′′ )ι(y ′ )ι(y)w2 = 2((y · y ′ , w)ι(y ′′ )w + (y ′ · y ′′ , w)ι(y)w + (y ′′ · y, w)ι(y ′ )w) (2.35)

                                                        19
                                                                                                               Pk
Now let {xi }, i = 1, . . . , k, be a Bg0 -orthonormal basis of g0 so that Casg0 =                                 i=1   x2i .
But now if we replace w in (2.35) by ν∗ (xi ) one has by (2.11) and (2.23)

 ι(y ′′ )ι(y ′ )ι(y)ν∗ (xi )2 = 2((y · y ′ , ν∗ (xi ))ι(y ′′ )ν∗ (xi ) + (y ′ · y ′′ , ν∗ (xi ))ι(y)ν∗ (xi )

                                          + (y ′′ · y, ν∗ (xi ))ι(y ′ )ν∗ (xi ))

                             = (ν∗t (y · y ′ ), xi )[y ′′ , xi ] + (ν∗t (y ′ · y ′′ ), xi )[y, xi]

                                          + (ν∗t (y ′′ · y), xi )[y ′ , xi ]
                                 1
                             =     (([y, y ′], xi )[y ′′ , xi ] + ([y ′ , y ′′ ], xi )[y, xi] + ([y ′′ , y], xi)[y ′ , xi ])
                                 2
But then summing over i = 1, . . . , k, yields

                                              1 ′′
         ι(y ′′ )ι(y ′ )ι(y)ν∗ (Casg0 ) =       ([y , [y, y ′]] + [y, [y ′, y ′′ ]] + [y ′ , [y ′′ , y]])           (2.36)
                                              2

But if z ∈ S 4 (v) then for any y ′′′ ∈ v, (y ′′′ , ι(y ′′ )ι(y ′ )ι(y)z) = (y · y ′ · y ′′ · y ′′′ , z) by
(2.3). Hence z = 0 if and only if ι(y ′′ )ι(y ′ )ι(y)z = 0 for all y, y ′ , y ′′ ∈ v since BS(v)
is non-singular on S 4 (v). Thus one has the Jacobi identity (2.33) if and only if the

component of ν∗ (Casg0 ) in S 4 (v) vanishes. The result then follows from (2.27). QED


     Assuming (ν, Bg ) is of super Lie type the scalar ν∗ (Casg0 ) describes the action

of ν∗ (Casg0 ) in the representation (0.9) of W (v). We can compute this scalar purely
in terms of the finite dimensional representation ν of g0 . Since Lie Sp(v) is a sim-
ple Lie algebra, it has a unique ad-invariant symmetric bilinear form up to scalar
multiplication. However two such forms present themselves to us. One, tr αβ for

α, β ∈ Lie Sp(v), and the second is given by BSv |S 2 (v). The following lemma com-
putes the ratio.


     Lemma 2.9. Let w, z ∈ S 2 (v). Then

                                                      1
                                        (w, z) =        tr (ad w ad z)|v                                            (2.37)
                                                      8



                                                          20
    Proof. By the simplicity of Lie Sp(v) it suffices to verify (2.37) for a single choice
of w and z where (w, z) 6= 0. In fact we choose w = z and w = u · v where u, v ∈ v are
chosen so that (u, v) = 1. Since of course (u, u) = (v, v) = 0 it follows immediately
from (2.2) that

                                    (u · v, u · v) = 1                             (2.38)

On the other hand by (2.11) one readily has

                                  ad u ad v(v) = 2v
                                                                                   (2.39)
                                  ad u ad v(u) = −2u

But ad u ad v clearly vanishes on the Bv -orthocomplement of the plane spanned by u
and v. Hence tr (ad u ad v)2 = 8. QED


    The representation ν of g0 of course extends to a representation of ν of U (g) on
v. We can now prove


    Theorem 2.10. Assume that (ν, Bg ) is of super Lie type. Then

                                              1
                              ν∗ (Casg0 ) =     tr ν(Casg0 )                       (2.40)
                                              8


    Proof. By Theorem 2.8, (2.15) and Lemma 2.9 one has, using notation in the
proof of Theorem 2.8,
                           ν∗ (Casg0 ) = χ(ν∗ (Casg0 ))

                                           k
                                       =         (ν∗ (xi ), ν∗ (xi ))
