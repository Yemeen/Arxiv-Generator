                                                  Abstract. We show that the Young tableaux theory and constructions of the irreducible rep-
                                             resentations of the Weyl groups of type A, B and D, Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types A, B, and D,
                                             the complex reflection groups G(r, p, n) and the corresponding cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,p,n ,
                                             can be obtained, in all cases, from the affine Hecke algebra of type A. The Young tableaux theory
                                             was extended to affine Hecke algebras (of general Lie type) in recent work of A. Ram. We also show
                                             how (in general Lie type) the representations of general affine Hecke algebras can be constructed
                                             from the representations of simply connected affine Hecke algebras by using an extended form of
                                             Clifford theory. This extension of Clifford theory is given in the Appendix.

                                                 Recent work of A. Ram [Ra2,5] gives a straightforward combinatorial construction of the
                                             simple calibrated modules of affine Hecke algebras (of general Lie type as well as type A). The first
                                             aim of this paper is to show that Young’s seminormal construction and all of its previously known
                                             generalizations are special cases of the construction in [Ra5]. In particular, the representation
                                             theory of
                                             (a) Weyl groups of types A, B, and D,
                                             (b) Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types A, B, and D,
                                             (c) the complex reflection groups G(r, p, n), and
                                             (d) the cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,p,n ,
                                             can be derived entirely from the representation theory of affine Hecke algebras of type A. Further-
                                             more, the relationship between the affine Hecke algebra and the objects in (a)-(d) always produces
                                             a natural set of Jucys-Murphy type elements and can be used to prove the standard Jucys-Murphy
                                             type theorems. In particular, we are able to use Bernstein’s results about the center of the affine
                                             Hecke algebra to show that, in the semisimple case, the center of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra
                                             Hr,1,n is the set of symmetric polynomials in the Jucys-Murphy elements.

     A. Young’s seminormal construction of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group
dates from 1931 [Yg1]. Young himself generalized his tableaux to treat the representation theory
of Weyl groups of types B and D [Yg2]. In 1974 P.N. Hoefsmit [Hf] generalized the seminormal
construction to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types A, B, and D. Hoefsmit’s work has never been
published and, in 1985, Dipper and James [DJ, Theorem 4.9] and H. Wenzl [Wz] independently
treated the seminormal construction for irreducible representations for Iwahori-Hecke algebras of
type A. In 1994 Ariki and Koike [AK] introduced (some of) the cyclotomic Hecke algebras and
generalized Hoefsmit’s construction to these algebras. The construction was generalized to a larger
class of cyclotomic Hecke algebras in [Ar2]. For a summary of this work see [Ra1] and [HR].
     General affine Hecke algebras are naturally associated to a reductive algebraic group and
the size of the commutative part of the affine Hecke algebra depends on the structure of the
corresponding algebraic group (simply connected, adjoint, etc.). The second aim of this paper is
to show that it is sufficient to understand the representation theory of the affine Hecke algebra in
the simply connected case. We describe explicitly how the representation theory of the other cases
is derived from the simply connected case.
     The machine which allows us to accomplish this reduction is a form of Clifford theory. Pre-
cisely, if R is an algebra and G is a finite group acting on R by automorphisms then the represen-
tation theory of the ring RG of fixed points of the G-action can be derived from the representation
theory of R and subgroups of G. This is an extension of the approach to Clifford theory given by
Macdonald [Mac2].
     Let us state precisely what is new in this paper. The main result has three parts:
 (1) The Hecke algebras Hr,p,n of the complex reflection groups G(r, p, n) can be obtained as fixed
     point subalgebras of the Hecke algebra Hr,1,n associated to the complex reflection group Gr,1,n
     via
                                            Hr,p,n = (Hr,1,n )Z/pZ .
(2) The Hecke algebras H̃L of nonadjoint p-adic groups can be obtained as fixed point subalgebras
    of the Hecke algebra H̃P associated to the corresponding adjoint p-adic group, via

                                            H̃L = (H̃P )P/L .

 (3) There is a form of Clifford theory (to our knowledge new) that allows one to completely deter-
     mine the representation theory of a fixed point subalgebra RG in terms of the representation
     theory of the algebra R and the group G.
We use this method to work out the representation theory of the algebras Hr,p,n in detail. Addi-
tional results include,
 (4) The discovery of the “right” affine braid groups B∞,p,n and affine Hecke algebras H∞,p,n to
     associate to the cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,p,n . The representation theory of these new
     groups and algebras is completely determined from the representation theory of the classical
     affine braid groups B∞,1,n and the classical affine Hecke algebras H∞,1,n of type A as a
     consequence of the results in (3).
Finally,
 (5) We show how the classical trick (due to Cherednik) for determining the representation theory
     of the algebras Hr,1,n from that of H∞,1,n arises from a map from the affine Hecke algebra
     of type C to the finite Hecke algebra of type C which corresponds to a folding of the Dynkin
     diagram. This explanation is new. We show that such maps from the affine Hecke algebra to
     the finite Hecke algebra cannot exist in general type, and we work out the details of the cases
     where such homomorphisms do arise from foldings.

     In a recent paper Reeder [Re] has used our results to prove the Langlands classification of
irreducible representations for general affine Hecke algebras. (Previously, this was known only in
the simply connected case, see Kazhdan and Lusztig [KL].) This also provides a classification of
the irreducible constituents of unramified principal series representations of general split reductive
p-adic groups. (The Kazhdan-Lusztig result provides this classification for groups with connected
center.)

                       1. Algebras with Young tableaux theories
     A. Young invented the theory of standard Young tableaux in order to describe the represen-
tation theory of the symmetric group Sn ; the group of n × n matrices such that
     (a) the entries are either 0 or 1,
     (b) there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column.
Young himself began to generalize the theory and in [Yg1] he provided a theory for the Weyl groups
of type B, i.e. the hyperoctahedral groups W Bn ∼= (Z/2Z) ≀ Sn of n × n matrices such that
     (a) the entries are either 0 or ±1,
     (b) there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column.
In the same paper Young also treated the Weyl group W Dn of n × n matrices such that
     (a) the entries are either 0 or ±1,
     (b) there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column,
     (c) the product of the nonzero entries is 1.
W. Specht [Sp] generalized the theory to cover the complex reflection groups G(r, 1, n) ∼
                                                                                        = (Z/rZ)≀Sn
consisting of n × n matrices such that
     (a) the entries are either 0 or rth roots of unity,
     (b) there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column.
     In the classification [ST] of finite groups generated by complex reflections there is a single
infinite family of groups G(r, p, n) and exactly 34 others, the “exceptional” complex reflection
groups. The groups G(r, p, n) are the groups of n × n matrices such that
     (a) the entries are either 0 or rth roots of unity,
     (b) there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column,
     (c) the (r/p)th power of the product of the nonzero entries is 1.
Though we do not know of an early reference which generalizes the theory of Young tableaux to
these groups, it is not difficult to see that the method that Young uses for the Weyl groups W Dn
extends easily to handle the groups G(r, p, n).
    Special cases of the groups G(r, p, n) are
     (a) G(1, 1, n) = Sn , the symmetric group,
     (b) G(2, 1, n) = W Bn , the hyperoctahedral group (i.e. the Weyl group of type Bn ),
     (c) G(2, 2, n) = W Dn , the Weyl group of type Dn ,

     (d) G(r, 1, n) ∼
                    = (Z/rZ) ≀ Sn = (Z/rZ)n ⋊ Sn .
The order of G(r, 1, n) is r n n!. Let Eij be the n × n matrix with 1 in the (i, j) position and all
other entries 0. Then G(r, 1, n) can be presented by generators
                            X                                                      X
             s1 = ζE11 +           Eii ,   and si = Ei,i+1 + Ei+1,i +                        Ejj ,   2 ≤ i ≤ n,
                            j6=1                                                  j6=i,i+1


where ζ is a primitive rth root of unity, and relations
   (B1) si sj = sj si ,              if |i − j| > 1,
   (B2) si si+1 si = si+1 si si+1 ,  for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
  (BB) s1 s2 s1 s2 = s2 s1 s2 s1 ,
    (C) sr1 = 1,
    (R) s2i = 1,                    for 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
The group G(r, p, n) is the subgroup of index p in G(r, 1, n) generated by

                            a0 = sp1 ,        a1 = s1 s2 s1 ,         ai = si ,      2 ≤ i ≤ n.

(1.1) Cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,1,n . More recently there has been an interest in Iwahori-
Hecke algebras associated to reflection groups and there has been significant work generalizing the
constructions of A. Young to these algebras. Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types A, B and D were
handled by Hoefsmit [Ho] and other aspects of the theory for these algebras were developed by
Dipper, James and Murphy [DJ, DJM], Gyoja [Gy] and Wenzl [Wz]. In 1994, Ariki and Koike
[AK] introduced cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,1,n for the complex reflection groups G(r, 1, n) and
they generalized the Young tableau theory to these algebras. Theorem 3.18 below shows that the
theory of [AK] is a special case of an even more general theory for affine Hecke algebras.
     Let u1 , . . . , ur , q ∈ C, q 6= 0. The cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) is the algebra
over C given by generators T1 , . . . , Tn and relations
   (B1) Ti Tj = Tj Ti ,                                    if |i − j| > 1,
     (B2)   Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 ,                             for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
    (BB)    T1 T2 T1 T2 = T2 T1 T2 T1 ,
    (qC)    (T1 − u1 )(T1 − u2 ) · · · (T1 − ur ) = 0,
    (qR)    (Ti − q)(Ti + q −1 ) = 0,                               for 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
                                                                n
The algebra Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) is of dimension r n! (see [AK]).
    (a) H1,1,n (1; q) is the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type An−1 .
    (b) H2,1,n (q, −q −1 ; q) is the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Bn .
    (c) If ζ is a primitive rth root of 1 then Hr,1,n (1, ζ, . . . , ζ r−1 ; 1) is the group algebra CG(r, 1, n).
Fact (c) says that the representation theory of the groups G(r, 1, n) is a special case of the repre-
sentation theory of the algebras Hr,1,n .
(1.2) Cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,p,n .            The work of Broué, Malle and Michel [BMM]
demonstrated that there are cyclotomic Hecke algebras associated to most complex reflection groups
(even exceptional complex reflection groups). In particular, there are cyclotomic Hecke algebras
Hr,p,n corresponding to all the groups G(r, p, n) and Ariki [Ar2] has generalized the Young tableau
mechanism to these groups (see also [HR]). Theorems 3.15 and the mechanism of Theorem 2.8
show that the theory of Ariki is a special case of a general construction for affine Hecke algebras.
                                            affine hecke algebras                                               5

     Let r, p, n ∈ Z>0 be such that p divides r and let d = r/p. Let x0 , . . . , xd−1 ∈ C and let ξ be
a primitive pth root of 1. For 1 ≤ j ≤ r, define

                  uj = ξ k xℓ ,     if j − 1 = ℓp + k,            (0 ≤ k ≤ p − 1, 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ d − 1)

i.e., u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C are chosen so that

                  (T1 − u1 )(T1 − u2 ) · · · (T1 − ur ) = (T1p − xp0 )(T1p − xp1 ) · · · (T1p − xpd−1 ).

The algebra Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q) is the subalgebra of Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) generated by the ele-
ments
                    a0 = T1p ,           a1 = T1−1 T2 T1 ,   ai = Ti , for 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Then
(a) H2,2,n (1; q) is the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Dn ,
(b) If η is a primitive dth root of unity then Hr,p,n (1, η, · · · , ηd−1 ; 1) is the group algebra CG(r, p, n).
(1.3) Affine braid groups of type A. There are three common ways of depicting affine braids
[Cr], [GL], [Jo]:
(a) As braids in a (slightly thickened) cylinder,
(b) As braids in a (slightly thickened) annulus,
(c) As braids with a flagpole.
See Figure 1. The multiplication is by placing one cylinder on top of another, placing one annulus
inside another, or placing one flagpole braid on top of another. These are equivalent formulations:
an annulus can be made into a cylinder by turning up the edges, and a cylindrical braid can be
made into a flagpole braid by putting a flagpole down the middle of the cylinder and pushing the
pole over to the left so that the strings begin and end to its right.
     The group formed by the affine braids with n strands is the affine braid group of type A.
The affine braid group B∞,1,n is presented by generators T2 , . . . , Tn and X ε1 (see Figure 2) with
relations
    (B1) Ti Tj = Tj Ti ,                         if |i − j| > 1,
    (B2) Ti Ti+1 Ti = Ti+1 Ti Ti+1 ,                      for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
             ε1       ε1            ε1      ε1
   (BB) X T2 X T2 = T2 X T2 X ,
   (B1′ ) X ε1 Ti = Ti X ε1 ,                             for 3 ≤ i ≤ n.
Inductively define X εi ∈ B∞,1,n by

                                         X εi = Ti X εi−1 Ti ,      2 ≤ i ≤ n.                              (1.4)

By drawing pictures of the corresponding affine braids one can check that the X εi all commute
with each other. View the symbols εi as a basis of Rn so that
                                          n

The affine braid group B∞,1,n contains a large abelian subgroup

                                                  X = {X λ | λ ∈ L},                                        (1.6)

    The pole winding number of an affine braid b ∈ B∞,1,n is κ(b) where κ: B∞,1,n → Z is the
group homomorphism defined by κ(X ε1 ) = 1 and κ(Ti ) = 0, 2 ≤ i ≤ n. The affine braid group
B∞,p,n is the subgroup of B∞,1,n of affine braids with pole winding number equal to 0 (mod p),

                            B∞,p,n = {b ∈ B∞,1,n | κ(b) = 0 (mod p)}.                            (1.7)

                                                                            X

for each nonnegative integer p. The lattice Lp is a lattice of index p in L. Then

                               B∞,p,n = hX λ , Ti | λ ∈ Lp , 2 ≤ i ≤ ni

and the group X Lp = hX λ | λ ∈ Lp i is an abelian subgroup of B∞,p,n .
(1.9) Affine Hecke algebras of type A. The affine Hecke algebra H∞,1,n (resp. H∞,p,n ) is
the quotient of the group algebra CB∞,1,n (resp. CB∞,p,n ) by the relations

                               Ti2 = (q − q −1 )Ti + 1,          2 ≤ i ≤ n.

Let L and X λ be as in (1.5) and (1.6). The subalgebra

               C[X] = span{X λ | λ ∈ L}           (resp. C[X Lp ] = span{X λ | λ ∈ Lp })       (1.10)

is a commutative subalgebra of H∞,1,n (resp. H∞,p,n ). The symmetric group Sn acts on the lattice
L by permuting the εi and the lattices Lp are Sn -invariant sublattices of L. Let si = (i, i − 1) ∈ Sn
and αi = εi − εi−1 . For 2 ≤ i ≤ n and λ ∈ L (resp. λ ∈ Lp ),

                                                                 X λ − X si λ

                                                                 1 − X −αi

     For each element w ∈ Sn define Tw = Ti1 · · · Tip if w = si1 · · · sip is an expression of w as a
product of simple reflections si such that p is minimal. The element Tw does not depend on the
choice of the reduced expression of w [Bou, Ch. IV §2 Ex. 23]. The sets

                  {X λ Tw | λ ∈ L, w ∈ Sn }        and      {X λ Tw | λ ∈ Lp , w ∈ Sn }

are bases of H∞,1,n and H∞,p,n , respectively [Lu]. The center of H∞,1,n is

                            Z(H∞,1,n ) = C[X ε1 , . . . , X εn ]Sn = C[X]Sn ,                  (1.12)

and C[X Lp ]Sn is the center of H∞,p,n (see Theorem 4.12 below).

                            2. Representation theory transfer
                                    affine hecke algebras                                          7

     In this section we provide the mechanism for obtaining the representation theory of H∞,p,n
from H∞,1,n and for obtaining the representation theory of cyclotomic Hecke algebras from affine
Hecke algebras. In order to obtain the representation theory of H∞,p,n from H∞,1,n we identify
H∞,p,n as the set of fixed points of a certain group G acting on H∞,1,n by automorphisms. Once
this is done, the extended version of Clifford theory given in the Appendix allows one to construct
the representations of H∞,p,n from those of H∞,1,n . The same technique can be applied to obtain
the representations of the braid groups B∞,p,n from those of B∞,1,n , of the complex reflection
groups G(r, p, n) from those of G(r, 1, n), and of the Weyl groups W Dn from those of the Weyl
groups W Bn .
(2.1) Obtaining H∞,p,n -modules from H∞,1,n -modules. The following result is what is
needed to apply the Clifford theory developed in the Appendix to derive the representation theory
of the algebras H∞,p,n from that of H∞,1,n .

Theorem 2.2. Let ξ be a primitive pth root of unity. The algebra automorphism g: H∞,1,n →
H∞,1,n defined by
                  g(X ε1 ) = ξX ε1 ,   and     g(Ti ) = Ti , 2 ≤ i ≤ n,

gives rise to an action of the group Z/pZ = {1, g, . . . , g p−1 } on H∞,1,n by algebra automorphisms
and
                                      H∞,p,n = (H∞,1,n )Z/pZ

is the set of fixed points of the Z/pZ-action.

Proof. Immediate from the definitions of H∞,1,n , H∞,p,n and (1.6).

     The action of Z/pZ on H∞,1,n which is given in Theorem 2.2 induces an action of Z/pZ on
the simple H∞,1,n -modules, see (A.1) in the Appendix. The stabilizer K of the action of Z/pZ
on a simple H∞,1,n -module M is the inertia group K of M . The action of K commutes with the
action of H∞,p,n on M and we have a decomposition

                                            |K|−1
                                             M
                                      M∼
                                       =            M (j) ⊗ K (j) ,                             (2.3)
                                             j=0


where K (j), 1 ≤ j ≤ |K| − 1, are the simple K-modules and M (j) are H∞,p,n -modules. Theo-
rem A.13 of the Appendix shows that the M (j) are simple H∞,p,n -modules and that all simple
H∞,p,n -modules are constructed in this way. In Theorem 3.15 we show that this method gives
a combinatorial construction of the module M (j) in any case when the Young tableau theory is
available. This is a generalization of the method used in [Ar2] and [HR].
(2.4) The surjective algebra homomorphisms Φ and Φp . The homomorphisms Φ and
Φp described below are the primary tools for transferring results from the affine Hecke algebras
to cyclotomic Hecke algebras. Many results are easier to prove for affine Hecke algebras because
of the large commutative subalgebra C[X] which is available in the affine Hecke algebra. The
homomorphism Φ has also been used by Cherednik [Ch2], Ariki [Ar3] and many others.

Proposition 2.5. Let H∞,1,n be the affine Hecke algebra of type A defined in (1.9) and let
Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) denote the cyclotomic Hecke algebra of (1.1).
8                                     A. Ram        and      J. Ramagge

(a) Fix u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C, q ∈ C∗ . There is a surjective algebra homomorphism given by
                     Φ: H∞,1,n        −→ Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)
                         Ti           7−→         Ti ,                        2 ≤ i ≤ n,
                         X ε1        7−→          T1 .
(b) Restricting the homomorphism Φ to H∞,p,n yields a surjective homomorphism defined by
                   Φp :   H∞,p,n        −→ Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q)
                            Ti         7 →
                                        −              ai ,                     2 ≤ i ≤ n,
                           X pε1      7−→              a0 ,
                          X ε2 −ε1   7−→            a1 a2 .

Proof. The result follows directly from the definitions of the affine Hecke algebras H∞,1,n and
H∞,p,n (see (1.9)) and the cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,1,n and Hr,p,n (see (1.1) and (1.2)).
                                                               Pn
    Let Lp be the lattice defined in (1.8) and define Cr = {λ = i=1 λi εi | 0 ≤ λi < r}. Ariki and
Koike [AK] and Ariki [Ar2] have shown that the sets

           {Φ(X λTw ) | λ ∈ Cr , w ∈ Sn }          and       {Φp (X λ Tw ) | λ ∈ Cr ∩ Lp , w ∈ Sn }     (2.6)

are bases of Hr,1,n and Hr,p,n , respectively.
(2.7) Relating H∞,1,n -modules and Hr,1,n -modules. The representation theory of the affine
Hecke algebra H∞,1,n is equivalent to the representation theory of the cyclotomic Hecke algebras
Hr,1,n (considering all possible u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C). The elementary constructions in the following
theorem allow us to make H∞,1,n -modules into Hr,1,n -modules and vice versa.

Theorem 2.8. Let H∞,1,n be the affine Hecke algebra of type A defined in (1.9) and let
Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) be the cyclotomic Hecke algebra of (1.1).
(a) Fix u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C, q ∈ C∗ , and let Φ be the surjective homomorphism of Proposition 2.5. If
     M is a simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-module then defining

                           hm = Φ(h)m,            for all h ∈ H∞,1,n and all m ∈ M ,

    makes M into a simple H∞,1,n -module.
(b) Let M be a simple H∞,1,n -module and let ρ: H∞,1,n → End(M ) be the corresponding repre-
    sentation. Let u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C be such that the minimal polynomial p(t) of the matrix ρ(X ε1 )
    divides the polynomial (t − u1 ) · · · (t − ur ). Define an action of Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) on M by

                            T1 m = X ε1 m          and       Ti m = Ti m,   2 ≤ i ≤ n,

    for all m ∈ M . Then M is a simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-module.

Proof. The Theorem follows directly from the definitions of H∞,1,n and Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q), and
the construction of the surjective homomorphism Φ.

Remark 2.9. The same translations work for arbitrary finite dimensional modules; in particular,
they work for indecomposable modules and preserve composition series.


    3. Standard Young tableaux, representations and Jucys-Murphy elements
                                       affine hecke algebras                                                9

     In this section we review the generalization of standard Young tableaux in [Ra5] which is used
to construct representations of the affine Hecke algebras H∞,1,n . Then we show how this theory can
be transported to provide combinatorial constructions of simple modules for the cyclotomic Hecke
algebras Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) and Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q). This approach shows that Jucy-Murphy
type elements in the cyclotomic Hecke algebras arise naturally as images of the elements X εi in the
affine Hecke algebra. The standard Jucys-Murphy type theorems then follow almost immediately
from standard affine Hecke algebra facts.
(3.1) Skew shapes and standard tableaux. A partition λ is a collection of n boxes in a
corner. We shall conform to the conventions in [Mac] and assume that gravity goes up and to the
left.




Any partition λ can be identified with the sequence λ = (λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . .) where λi is the number
of boxes in row i of λ. The rows and columns are numbered in the same way as for matrices. In
the example above we have λ = (553311). If λ and µ are partitions such that µi ≤ λi for all i we
write µ ⊆ λ. The skew shape λ/µ consists of all boxes of λ which are not in µ. Any skew shape is a
union of connected components. Number the boxes of each skew shape λ/µ along major diagonals
from southwest to northeast and

                                write boxi to indicate the box numbered i.

     Let λ/µ be a skew shape with n boxes. A standard tableau of shape λ/µ is a filling of the
boxes in the skew shape λ/µ with the numbers 1, . . . , n such that the numbers increase from left
to right in each row and from top to bottom down each column.
(3.2) Placed skew shapes. Let R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )) = {a + bi | a ∈ R, 0 ≤ b ≤ 2π/ ln(q 2 )} ⊆ C.
If q is a positive real number then the function

                                 R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )) −→    C∗
                                                                          2
                                           x            7−→   q 2x = eln(q )x

is a bijection. The elements of [0, 1) + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )) index the Z-cosets in R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )).
     A placed skew shape is a pair (c, λ/µ) consisting of a skew shape λ/µ and a content function

                        c: {boxes of λ/µ} −→ R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 ))        such that                    (3.3)

     c(boxj ) − c(boxi ) ≥ 0,                      if i < j and c(boxj ) − c(boxi ) ∈ Z,
     c(boxj ) = c(boxi ) + 1,         if and only if boxi and boxj are on adjacent diagonals, and
     c(boxi ) = c(boxj ),                if and only if boxi and boxj are on the same diagonal.
This is a generalization of the usual notion of the content of a box in a partition (see [Mac] I §1
Ex. 3).
     Suppose that (c, λ/µ) is a placed skew shape such that c takes values in Z. One can visualize
(c, λ/µ) by placing λ/µ on a piece of infinite graph paper where the diagonals of the graph paper
10                                   A. Ram    and     J. Ramagge

are indexed consecutively (with elements of Z) from southeast to northwest. The content of a
box b is the index c(b) of the diagonal that b is on. In the general case, when c takes values in
R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )), one imagines a book where each page is a sheet of infinite graph paper with
the diagonals indexed consecutively (with elements of Z) from southeast to northwest. The pages
are numbered by values β ∈ [0, 1) + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )) and there is a skew shape λ(β) /µ(β) placed on
page β. The skew shape λ/µ is a union of the disjoint skew shapes on each page,
                               G            
                         λ/µ =     λ(β) /µ(β) ,     β ∈ [0, 1) + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 )),             (3.4)
                              β

and the content function is given by

     c(b) = (page number of the page containing b) + (index of the diagonal containing b).       (3.5)

for a box b ∈ λ/µ.

boxes in a skew shape λ/µ.

(3.7) Calibrated H∞,1,n -modules. A finite dimensional H̃∞,1,n -module M is calibrated if it
has a basis {vt } such that for each λ ∈ L and each vt in the basis

                               X λ vt = t(X λ )vt ,        for some t(X λ ) ∈ C.

This is the class of representations of the affine Hecke algebra for which there is a good theory of
Young tableaux [Ra2].
     The following theorem classifies and constructs all irreducible calibrated representations of
the affine Hecke algebra H∞,1,n . The construction is a direct generalization of A. Young’s clas-
sical “seminormal construction” of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group [Yg2].
Young’s construction was generalized to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type A by Hoefsmit [Hf] and
Wenzl [Wz] independently, to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of types B and D by Hoefsmit [Hf] and to
cyclotomic Hecke algebras by Ariki and Koike [AK]. In (3.7) and (3.11) below we show how all
of these earlier generalizations of Young’s construction can be obtained from Theorem 3.8. Some
parts of Theorem 3.8 are originally due to I. Cherednik, and are stated in [Ch1, §3].

Theorem 3.8. ([Ra, Theorem 4.1]) Let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape with n boxes. Define an
action of H∞,1,n on the vector space

                  H̃ (c,λ/µ) = C−span{vL | L is a standard tableau of shape λ/µ}

by the formulas
                                X εi vL = q 2c(L(i))vL ,
                                  Ti vL = (Ti )LL vL + (q −1 + (Ti )LL )vsi L ,
where si L is the same as L except that the entries i − 1 and i are interchanged,

                             q − q −1
         (Ti )LL =                                ,   vsi L = 0 if si L is not a standard tableau,
                     1 − q 2(c(L(i−1))−c(L(i)))

and L(i) denotes the box of L containing the entry i.
(a) H̃ (c,λ/µ) is a calibrated irreducible H∞,1,n -module.
(b) The modules H̃ (c,λ/µ) are non-isomorphic.
(c) Every irreducible calibrated H∞,1,n -module is isomorphic to H̃ (c,λ/µ) for some placed skew
    shape (c, λ/µ).

Remark 3.9. All of the irreducible modules for the affine Hecke algebra have been classified and
constructed by Kazhdan and Lusztig [KL]. The construction in [KL] is geometric and noncombi-
natorial. It is nontrivial to relate the construction of Theorem 3.8 and the classification in [KL].
This point is the subject of [RR].

(3.10) Calibrated H∞,p,n -modules. A finite dimensional H∞,p,n module M is calibrated if it
has a basis {vt } such that for each λ ∈ Lp and each vt in the basis

                               X λ vt = t(X λ )vt ,        for some t(X λ ) ∈ C.

Let us show how Theorem 3.8, Theorem 2.2 and Theorem A.13 provide explicit constructions of
simple calibrated H∞,p,n -modules. The resulting construction is a generalization of the construc-
tion of Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q)-modules given by Ariki [Ar2] (as amplified and applied in [HR]).
Comparing the following machinations with those in [HR, §3] (where more pictures are given) will
be helpful.
     The (Z/pZ)-action on H∞,1,n induces an action of Z/pZ on the simple H∞,1,n -modules, as in
(A.1) of the Appendix, and this action takes calibrated modules to calibrated modules since the
(Z/pZ)-action on H∞,1,n preserves the subalgebra C[X]. The Z/pZ action on simple calibrated
modules can be described combinatorially as follows.
     If (c, λ/µ) is a placed skew shape with n boxes and g ∈ Z/pZ define
                               g(c, λ/µ) = (c − iα/p, λ/µ),                  where α = 2π/ ln(q 2 ),         (3.11)
and c − iα/p denotes the content function defined by (c − iα/p)(b) = c(b) − iα/p, for all boxes
b ∈ λ/µ. To make this definition we are identifying the set [0, α) with R/αZ. One can imagine
the placed skew shape as a book with pages numbered by values β ∈ [0, 1) + i(R/αZ) and a skew
shape λ(β) /µ(β) on each page. The action of

                    g cyclically permutes the pages numbered β + i(k/p)α, 0 ≤ k < p.
If L is a standard tableau of shape (c, λ/µ) let gL denote the same filling of λ/µ as L but viewed
as a standard tableaux of shape g(c, λ/µ).
     Let g H̃ (c,λ/µ) be the H∞,1,n -module H̃ (c,λ/µ) except twisted by the automorphism g, see (A.1)
in the Appendix. It follows from the formulas in Theorem 3.8 that the map
                                                     g
                                              φ:         H̃ (c,λ/µ)   −→       H̃ g(c,λ/µ)
                                                                                                             (3.12)
                                                            vL        7−→          vgL
is an H∞,1,n -module isomorphism. Indeed, since g −1 (Tj ) = Tj and (Tj )gL,gL = (Tj )LL ,

      φ(Tj ◦ vL ) = Tj φ(vL ),              and
           εj                  −1
     φ(X        ◦ vL ) = φ(g        (X )vL ) = φ(ξ −1 X εj vL ) = q 2(c(L(j))−iα/p)vgL = X εj vgL = X εj φ(vL ),
                                       εj


where ◦ denotes the H∞,1,n -action on g H̃ (c,λ/µ) as in (A.1). Identify g H̃ (c,λ/µ) with H̃ g(c,λ/µ) via
the isomorphism in (3.12).
     Let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape with n boxes and let K(c,λ/µ) be the stabilizer of (c, λ/µ)
under the action of Z/pZ. The cyclic group K(c,λ/µ) is a realization of the inertia group of H̃ (c,λ/µ)
and
                  K(c,λ/µ) = {(g κ )ℓ : H̃ (c,λ/µ) → H̃ (c,λ/µ) | 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ |Kc,λ/µ) | − 1},
where κ is the smallest integer between 1 and p such that g κ (c, λ/µ) = (c, λ/µ) and |K(c,λ/µ) | is the
order of K(c,λ/µ) . The elements of K(c,λ/µ) are all H∞,p,n -module isomorphisms. Since K(c,λ/µ) is
a cyclic group the irreducible K(c,λ/µ) -modules are all one-dimensional and the characters of these
modules are given explicitly by
                          ηj :       K(c,λ/µ)       −→ C
                                                                               0 ≤ j ≤ |K(c,λ/µ) | − 1,
                                       gκ          7−→ ξ jκ ,
since ξ κ is a primitive |K(c,λ/µ) |-th root of unity. The element
                                                           |K(c,λ/µ) |−1

is the minimal idempotent of the group algebra CK(c,λ/µ) corresponding to the irreducible character
ηj . It follows (from a standard double centralizer result, [Bou2]) that, as an (H∞,p,n , K(c,λ/µ) )-
bimodule,

                            |K(c,λ/µ) |−1

                                j=0


and K (j) is the irreducible K(c,λ/µ) -module with character ηj . The following theorem now follows
from Theorem A.13 of the Appendix.

Theorem 3.15. Let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape with n boxes and let H̃ (c,λ/µ) be the simple
calibrated H∞,1,n -module constructed in Theorem 3.8. Let K(c,λ/µ) be the inertia group of H̃ (c,λ/µ)
corresponding to the action of Z/pZ on H∞,1,n defined by (A.1). If pj is the minimal idempotent
of K(c,λ/µ) given by (3.13) then
                                     H̃ (c,λ/µ,j) = pj H̃ (c,λ/µ)

is a simple calibrated H∞,p,n -module.

   Theorem 3.15 provides a generalization of the construction of the Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q)-
modules which was given by Ariki [Ar2] and extended and applied in [HR].
(3.16) Simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-modules. Many (usually all) of the simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-
modules can be constructed with Theorems 2.8 and 3.8.
    If λ/µ is a skew shape define

                                    N W (λ/µ) = {northwest corner boxes of λ/µ},

so that N W (λ/µ) is the set of boxes b ∈ λ/µ such that there is no box of λ/µ immediately above
or immediately to the left of b.

Theorem 3.17. Fix u1 , . . . , ur ∈ C∗ and let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape with n boxes. If

                                        {q 2c(b) | b ∈ N W (λ/µ)} ⊆ {u1 , . . . , ur }

then the H∞,1,n -module H̃ (c,λ/µ) is a simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-module (via Theorem 2.8).

Proof. Let (c, λ/µ) be a placed skew shape with n boxes and let H̃ (c,λ/µ) be the simple H∞,1,n -
module of Theorem 3.8. Let ρ(c,λ/µ) : H∞,1,n → End(H̃ (c,λ/µ) ) be the representation corresponding
to H̃ (c,λ/µ) . By the formulas in Theorem 3.8 the matrix ρ(X ε1 ) is diagonal with eigenvalues
q 2c(L(1)) , for L ∈ F (c,λ/µ) , where F (c,λ/µ) is the set of standard tableaux of shape λ/µ.
      The boxes L(1), L ∈ F (c,λ/µ) are exactly the northwest corner boxes of λ/µ and so the minimal
polynomial of ρ(X ε1 ) is
                                                     Y
                                        p(t) =              (t − q 2c(b) ).
                                                          b∈N W (λ/µ)

Thus the condition {q 2c(b) | b ∈ N W (λ/µ)} ⊆ {u1 , . . . , ur } is exactly what is needed for H̃ (c,λ/µ)
to be an Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-module via Theorem 2.8.

Theorem 3.18. If the cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hr,1,n (u1 , u2 , . . . , ur ; q) is semisimple, then its
simple modules are the modules H̃ (c,λ) constructed in Theorem 3.17, where λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r) ) is
an r-tuple of partitions with a total of n boxes and c is the content function determined by

                          q 2c(b) = ui ,     if b is the northwest corner box of λ(i) .


Proof. The equations q 2c(b) = ui , for b ∈ N W (λ(i) ), determine the values c(b) for all boxes b ∈ λ and
thus the pair (c, λ) defines a placed skew shape. By a Theorem of Ariki [Ar1], Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)
is semisimple if and only if

                               [n]q ! 6= 0         and       ui u−1        2           2n
                                                                 j 6∈ {1, q , . . . , q },


where [n]q ! = [n]q [n − 1]q · · · [2]q [1]q and [k]q = (q k − q −k )/(q − q −1 ). These conditions guar-
antee that (c, λ) is a placed skew shape and that the H̃∞,1,n -module H̃ (c,λ) defined in Theorem
3.8 is well defined and irreducible. The reduction in Theorem 2.8 makes H̃ (c,λ) into a simple
Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-module and a count of standard tableaux (using binomial coefficients and the
classical identity for the symmetric group case) shows that
                                   X
                                                  dim(H̃ (c,λ) )2 = r n n! = dim(Hr,1,n ),
                            λ=(λ(1) ,...,λ(r) )


where the sum is over all r-tuples λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r) ) with a total of n boxes. Thus the H̃ (c,λ) are
a complete set of simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-modules.

    Theorem 3.18 demonstrates that the construction of simple modules for Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)
by Ariki and Koike [AK, Theorem 3.7], for H2,1,n (p, −p−1 ; q) by Hoefsmit [Hf], for H1,1,n (1; q) by
Hoefsmit [Hf] and Wenzl [Wz] (independently), and for H1,1,n (1; 1) = CSn and H2,1,n (1, 1; 1) =
CW Bn by Young [Yg1-2], are all special cases of Theorem 3.8.
(3.19) Jucys-Murphy elements in cyclotomic Hecke algebras. The following result is
well known, but we give a new proof which shows that the cyclotomic Hecke algebra analogues of
the Jucys-Murphy elements which have appeared in the literature (see [BMM], [Ra1], [DJM] and
the references there) come naturally from the affine Hecke algebra H∞,1,n .

Corollary 3.20. Let Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) and Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q) be the cyclotomic Hecke
algebras defined in (1.1) and (1.2).
(a) The elements
                                Mi = Ti · · · T2 T1 T2 · · · Ti ,    1 ≤ i ≤ n,
    generate a commutative subalgebra of Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q).
(b) If Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) is semisimple then every simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-module has a basis
    of simultaneous eigenvectors of the elements Mi .
(c) The elements

                  M1p = a0 ,         and           Mi M1−1 = ai · · · a3 a2 a1 a3 · · · ai ,   2 ≤ i ≤ n,

    generate a commutative subalgebra of Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q).
(d) If Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q) is semisimple then every simple Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q)-module has a
    basis of simultaneous eigenvectors of the elements M1p and Mi M1−1 , 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

Proof. (a) The elements X εi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, generate the subalgebra C[X] ⊆ H∞,1,n . Inductive
use of the relation (1.4) shows that Mi = Φ(X εi ), where Φ: H∞,1,n → Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) is the
homomorphism in Proposition 2.5. Thus the subalgebra of Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) generated by the
element Mi is the image of C[X] under the homomorphism Φ.
(b) is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.18, the construction described in Theorem 3.8, and
the fact that Mi = Φ(X εi ).
(c) The elements X pε1 and X εi −ε1 , 2 ≤ i ≤ n, generate the subalgebra C[X Lp ] ⊆ H∞,p,n and the
images of these elements under the homomorphism Φp : H∞,p,n → Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q) are the
elements M1p and Mi M1−1 .
The proof of part (d) uses the construction described in Theorem 3.15 and is analogous to the
proof of part (b).

(3.21) The center of Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q).        It is an immediate consequence of (1.12) and the
proof of Corollary 3.20 that

                               C[M1 , . . . , Mn ]Sn ⊆ Z(Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)),

where Mi = Ti Ti−1 · · · T2 T1 T2 · · · Ti−1 Ti . The following proposition shows that this inclusion is an
equality.

Proposition 3.22. If the cyclotomic Hecke algebra Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) is semisimple then its
center
                       Z(Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)) = C[M1 , . . . , Mn ]Sn ,
where Mi = Ti Ti−1 · · · T2 T1 T2 · · · Ti−1 Ti and C[M1 , . . . , Mn ]Sn is the ring of symmetric polynomials
in M1 , . . . , Mn .

Proof. By (1.12) Z(H∞,1,n ) = C[X]Sn . Thus, since Mi = Φ(X εi ), where Φ: H∞,1,n → Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)
is the surjective homomorphism of Proposition 2.5, it follows that

             C[M1 , . . . , Mn ]Sn = Φ(C[X]Sn ) = Φ(Z(H∞,1,n )) ⊆ Z(Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)).

     For the reverse inclusion we need to show that the action of the elements C[M1 , . . . , Mn ]Sn
distinguishes the simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-modules.
     Let λ = (λ(1) , . . . , λ(r) ) be an r-tuple of partitions with a total of n boxes and let H̃ (c,λ)
be the corresponding simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-module as constructed by Theorem 3.18 (and
Theorem 3.8). If L is a standard tableau of shape λ then M1 , . . . , Mn act on vL by the multiset of
values (q 2c(L(1)) , . . . , q 2c(L(n)) ). The elementary symmetric functions ei (M1 , . . . , Mn ) act on H̃ (c,λ)
by the values ai = ei (q 2c(L(1)), . . . , q 2c(L(n)) ). Note that ai does not depend on the choice of the
standard tableau L (since ei (M1 , . . . , Mn ) ∈ Z(Hr,1,n )). We show that the simple module H̃ (c,λ)
is determined by the values a1 , . . . , an . This shows that the simple modules are distinguished by
the elements of C[M1 , . . . , Mn ]Sn .
     Let us explain how the values a1 , . . . , an determine the placed skew shape (c, λ). There is a
unique (unordered) multiset of values b1 , . . . , bn such that ei (b1 , . . . , bn ) = ai for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The
bi are determined by the equation

                    (t − b1 ) · · · (t − bn ) = tn − a1 tn−1 + a2 tn−2 − a3 tn−3 + · · · ± an .

From the previous paragraph, the multiset {b1 , . . . , bn } must be the same as the multiset
16                                      A. Ram       and     J. Ramagge

{q 2c(L(1)) , . . . , q 2c(L(n)) }. In this way the multiset S = {c(L(1)), . . . , c(L(n))} is determined by
a1 , . . . , an .
        The multiset S is a disjoint union S = S1 ⊔ · · · ⊔ Sr of multisets such that each Si is in
a single Z-coset of R + i[0, 2π/ ln(q 2 ))i (see (3.4)). These Z cosets are determined by the values
u1 , . . . , ur and thus there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ui and the multisets Si . Then
|λ(i) | = Card(Si ), the nonempty diagonals of λ(i) are determined by the values in Si , and the lengths
of the diagonals of λ(i) are the multiplicities of the values of the elements of Si . This information
completely determines λ(i) for each i. Thus (c, λ) is determined by the values a1 , . . . , an .

Remark 3.23. In the language of affine Hecke algebra representations (see [Ra2]) the proof of
Proposition 3.22 shows that (when Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) is semisimple) the simple Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)-
modules H̃ (c,λ) all have different central characters (as H∞,1,n modules).

Remark 3.24. The elements M1p and Mi M1−1 from Corollary 3.20 cannot be used to obtain a
direct analogue of Proposition 3.22 for Hr,p,n (x0 , . . . , xd−1 ; q). This is because all of the H∞,p,n -
modules Vj appearing in the decomposition (3.14) will have the same central character. However,
when n is odd, the natural analogue of Proposition 3.22 does hold for Iwahori-Hecke algebras of
type Dn , HDn (q) = H2,2,n (1; q). In that case, every simple H2,1,n -module has trivial inertia group
and the decomposition in (3.14) has only one summand.

                           4. Affine Hecke algebras of general type
     Let R be a reduced root system and let R∨ be the root system formed by the coroots α∨ =
2α/hα, αi, for α ∈ R. Let W be the Weyl group of R and fix a system of positive roots R+ in R.
Let {α1 , . . . , αn } be the corresponding simple roots and let s1 , . . . , sn be the corresponding simple
reflections in W . The fundamental weights are defined by the equations hωi , α∨            j i = δij and the
lattices

extended Dynkin diagrams are given in Figure 3. If Γ is a Dynkin diagram or extended Dynkin

(4.1) Affine Weyl groups. The extended affine Weyl group is the group

                     W̃ = W ⋉ P = {wtλ | w ∈ W, λ ∈ P },                where wtλ = twλ w,

for w ∈ W and λ ∈ P where tλ corresponds to translation by λ ∈ P . Define s0 ∈ W̃ by the
equation

see [Bou Ch. IV §1 no. 2.1]. The subgroup Waff = W ⋉ Q of W̃ is presented by generators
s0 , s1 , . . . , sn and relations

where the mij are determined from the extended Dynkin diagram of the root system R∨ . Define

                       Ω = {gi | ωi is minuscule},               where gi w0 w0,i = tωi ,                   (4.3)

w0 is the longest element of W and w0,i is the longest element of the group hsj | 1 ≤ j ≤ n, j 6= ii,
see [Bou Ch. IV §2 Prop. 6]. Then Ω ∼       = P/Q and each element g ∈ Ω corresponds to an
automorphism of the extended Dynkin diagram of R∨ , in the sense that

                                       if g ∈ Ω then gsi g −1 = sσ(i) ,                                     (4.4)

where σ is the permutation of the nodes determined by the automorphism. Equation (4.4) means
that W̃ = Waff ⋊ Ω. The usual length function on the Coxeter group Waff is extended to the group
W̃ by
                          ℓ(wg) = ℓ(w),      for w ∈ Waff and g ∈ Ω.
    Let L be a lattice such that Q ⊆ L ⊆ P . View L/Q as a subgroup of Ω ∼
                                                                         = P/Q and let

                                        W̃L = W ⋉ L = Waff ⋊ (L/Q).

Then Waff = W̃Q , W̃ = W̃P , and W̃L is a subgroup of W̃ .
(4.5) Affine braid groups. Let L be a lattice such that Q ⊆ L ⊆ P . The affine braid group
B̃L is the group given by generators Tw , w ∈ W̃L , and relations

Let B̃aff = B̃Q . View L/Q as a subgroup of Ω ∼= P/Q. Then BL = Baff ⋊ L/Q is presented by
generators Ti = Tsi , 0 ≤ i ≤ n, and relations

By [Mac3, 3.4] and [Lu], the X λ are well defined and do not depend on the choice λ = µ − ν, and

                                 X λ X µ = X µ X λ = X λ+µ ,            for λ, µ ∈ P .                      (4.8)

Then X λ ∈ B̃L if and only if λ ∈ L.

The Iwahori-Hecke algebra H is the subalgebra of H̃ generated by T1 , . . . , Tn .
    To our knowledge, the following theorem is due to Bernstein and Zelevinsky in type A, and to
Bernstein in general type (unpublished). Lusztig has given an exposition in [Lu]. We give a new
proof which we believe is more elementary and more direct.

Theorem 4.12. (Bernstein, Zelevinsky, Lusztig [Lu]) Let L be a lattice such that Q ⊆ L ⊆ P ,
where Q is the root lattice and P is the weight lattice of the root system R. Let H̃ = H̃L be the
affine Hecke algebra corresponding to L and let C[X] = span{X λ | λ ∈ L}. Let W be the Weyl
group of R. Then the center of H̃ is

                    Z(H̃) = C[X]W = {f ∈ C[X] | wf = f for every w ∈ W } .

Proof. Assume                             X
                                  z=              cλ,w X λ Tw ∈ Z(H̃).
                                       λ∈L,w∈W

Let m ∈ W be maximal in Bruhat order subject to cγ,m 6= 0 for some γ ∈ L. If m 6= 1 there exists
a dominant µ ∈ L such that cγ+µ−mµ,m = 0 (otherwise cγ+µ−mµ,m 6= 0 for every dominant µ ∈ L,
which is impossible since z is a finite linear combination of X λ Tw ). Since z ∈ Z(H̃) we have
                                                   X
                             z = X −µ zX µ =               cλ,w X λ−µ Tw X µ .
                                                 λ∈L,w∈W


Repeated use of the relation (4.11) yields
                                                   X
                                     Tw X µ =              dν,v X ν Tv
                                                 ν∈L,v∈W


where dν,v are constants such that dwµ,w = 1, dν,w = 0 for ν 6= wµ, and dν,v = 0 unless v ≤ w. So
                         X                         X         X
                  z=             cλ,w X λ Tw =                       cλ,w dν,v X λ−µ+ν Tv
                       λ∈L,w∈W                   λ∈L,w∈W ν∈L,v∈W


and comparing the coefficients of X γ Tm gives cγ,m = cγ+µ−mµ,m
                                                          P     dmµ,m . Since cγ+µ−mµ,m = 0 it
follows that cγ,m = 0, which is a contradiction. Hence z = λ∈L cλ X λ ∈ C[X].
     The relation (4.11) gives

                                  zTi = Ti z = (si z)Ti + (q − q −1 )z ′

where z ′ ∈ C[X]. Comparing coefficients of X λ on both sides yields z ′ = 0. Hence zTi = (si z)Ti ,
and therefore z = si z for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. So z ∈ C[X]W .

(4.13) Deducing the H̃L representation theory from H̃P . Although we have not taken this
point of view in our presentation, the affine Hecke algebras defined above are naturally associated
to a reductive algebraic group G over C [KL] or a p-adic Chevalley group [IM]. In this formulation,
the lattice L is determined by the group of characters of the maximal torus of G. It is often
convenient to work only with the adjoint version or only with the simply connected version of the
group G and therefore it seems desirable to be able to derive the representation theory of the affine
Hecke algebras H̃L from the representation theory of the affine Hecke algebra H̃P . The following
                                       affine hecke algebras                                                         19

theorem shows that this can be done in a simple way by using the extension of Clifford theory in
the Appendix. In particular, Theorem A.13, can be used to construct all of the simple H̃L -modules
from the simple H̃P -modules.

Theorem 4.14. Let L be a lattice such that Q ⊆ L ⊆ P , where Q is the root lattice and P is the
weight lattice of the root system R. Let H̃ = H̃L be the affine Hecke algebra corresponding to L.
Then there is an action of a finite group K on H̃P , acting by automorphisms, such that

                                                  H̃L = (H̃P )K ,

is the subalgebra of fixed points under the action of the group K.

Proof. There are two cases to consider, depending on whether the group Ω ∼
                                                                         = P/Q is cyclic or not.
       Type   An−1  Bn   Cn  D2n−1                           D2n      E6   E7  E8                       F4   G2

In each case we construct the group K and its action on H̃P explicitly. This is necessary for the
effective application of Theorem A.13 on examples.
Case 1. If Ω is a cyclic group Ω then the subgroup L/Q is a cyclic subgroup. Suppose

                   Ω = {1, g, . . . , g r−1 }          and     L/Q = {1, g d , . . . , g d(p−1) },

where pd = r. Let ζ be a primitive pth root of unity and define an automorphism
                                 σ:   H̃P       −→      H̃P
                                       g         7−→    ζg ,
                                       Ti       7−→     Ti ,           0 ≤ i ≤ n.

The map σ is an algebra isomorphism since it preserves the relations in (4.6) and (4.10). Further-
more, σ gives rise to a Z/pZ action on H̃P and

                                                 H̃L = (H̃P )Z/pZ .                                               (4.15)

Case 2. If the root system R∨ is of type Dn , n even, then Ω ∼
                                                             = Z/2Z × Z/2Z and the subgroups
of Ω correspond to the intermediate lattices Q ⊆ L ⊆ P . Suppose

                           Ω = {1, g1 , g2 , g1 g2 | g12 = g22 = 1, g1 g2 = g2 g1 }.

and define automorphisms of H̃P by
                    σ1 :   H̃P     −→ H̃P                           σ2 :   H̃P    −→      H̃P
                            g1     7−→ −g1 ,                                g1    7−→      g1 ,
                                                         and
                            g2      7−→ g2 ,                                g2     7−→    −g2 ,
                            Ti       7−→ Ti ,                               Ti      7−→    Ti .
Then
               H̃L1 = (H̃P )σ1 ,        H̃L2 = (H̃P )σ2 ,          and        H̃Q = (H̃P )hσ1 ,σ2 i ,             (4.16)
where L1 and L2 are the two intermediate lattices strictly between Q and P .


                    5. Where does the homomorphism Φ come from?
20                                            A. Ram                         and    J. Ramagge

     The homomorphism Φ: H∞,1,n → Hr,1,n of Proposition 2.5 is a powerful tool for transporting
results about the affine Hecke algebra of type A to the cyclotomic Hecke algebras. In this section
we show how this homomorphism arises naturally, from a folding of the Dynkin diagram of B̃n ,
and we give some generalizations of the homomorphism Φ to other types.

Example 1. Type Cn . The root system R of type Cn can be realized by

                                      R = {±2εi , ±(εj − εi ) | 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n},

where εi are an orthonormal basis of Rn . The simple roots and the fundamental weights are given
by
                         α1 = 2ε1 ,      αi = εi − εi−1 ,   2 ≤ i ≤ n,


                                   ωi = εn + εn−1 + · · · + εi ,                         1 ≤ i ≤ n.
If φ∨ is the highest root of R∨ then

     φ = εn + εn−1 ,         and       sφ∨ = (sn−1 · · · s2 s1 s2 · · · sn−1 )sn (sn−1 · · · s2 s1 s2 · · · sn−1 ).                (5.1)

Then ωn = εn is the only miniscule weight,

                                 w0 = (1, −1)(2, −2) · · · (n, −n),
                               w0,n = (1, −1)(2, −2) · · · (n − 1, −(n − 1)),                                  and                 (5.2)
                           w0 w0,n = (n, −n) = sn · · · s2 s1 s2 · · · sn .

extends to a well defined surjective group homomorphism. From the identity (4.3),

                                       ΦC̃C (X εn ) = ΦC̃C (X ωn )
                                                         = ΦC̃C (gn Tn Tn−1 · · · T2 T1 T2 · · · Tn−1 Tn )
                                                         = Tn Tn−1 · · · T2 T1 T2 · · · Tn−1 Tn .

By inductively applying the relation X εi = Ti X εi−1 Ti we get

                            ΦC̃C (X εi ) = Ti Ti−1 · · · T2 T1 T2 · · · Ti−1 Ti ,                          for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.


Example 2. Type An−1 . Since the weight lattice P for the root system of type Cn is the same
as the lattice L defined in (1.5) we have an injective homomorphism

                                        ΦÃC̃ :    B∞,1,n                   −→             B̃P (Cn )
                                                    Ti                     7−→                Ti ,               2 ≤ i ≤ n,
                                                    X εi                    7−→              X εi .

The composition of ΦÃC̃ and the map ΦC̃C from (5.5) is the surjective homomorphism defined by

                             Φ:    B∞,1,n          −→      B(Cn )
                                    Ti            7 →
                                                   −       Ti ,                                                                        2 ≤ i ≤ n,
                                    X εi         7−→       Ti Ti−1 · · · T2 T1 T2 · · · Ti−1 Ti ,                                      1 ≤ i ≤ n.

In fact, it follows from the defining relations of B∞,1,n and B(Cn ) that the map Φ is an isomorphism!
     The cyclotomic Hecke algebras Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) are quotients of CB(Cn ) and in this way
the group homomorphism Φ is the source of the algebra homomorphism

                                                   Φ: H∞,1,n −→ Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q)

which was used extensively in Section 3 to relate the representation theory of the cyclotomic Hecke
algebras Hr,1,n (u1 , . . . , ur ; q) to the affine Hecke algebra of type A.

Example 3. Type Dn . Let R be the root system of type Dn . Then R∨ is also of type Dn and
inspection of the Dynkin diagrams of types D̃n and Dn yields a surjective algebra homomorphism

Proposition 5.6. Let H̃(G2 ) be the affine Hecke algebra of type G2 as given by (4.6) and (4.10)
and let H(G2 ) be the Iwahori-Hecke subalgebra of type G2 generated by T1 and T2 . There does
not exist an algebra homomorphism Φ: H̃(G2 ) → H(G2 ) such that Φ(Ti ) = Ti , for 1 ≤ i ≤ 2.

Proof. There is an irreducible representation of H̃(G2 ) given by
                                                                                                                 
                          q     0                                          1            2 − q −2   q 2 − 1 + q −2
         ρ(T1 ) =                          ,     and           ρ(T2 ) =                                                 ,
                          0    −q −1                                    q + q −1           3           q2 − 2

(see [Ra1, Theorem 6.11]). We show that there does not exist a 2 × 2 matrix N which satisfies

          N 2 = (q − q −1 )N + 1,               N ρ(T2 )N = ρ(T2 )N ρ(T2 )          and N ρ(T1 ) = ρ(T1 )N.

If N exists then N must be diagonal since N commutes with ρ(T1 ) and ρ(T1 ) is a diagonal matrix
with distinct eigenvalues. The first equation shows that N is invertible and the second equation
shows that N is conjugate to ρ(T2 ). It follows that N must have one eigenvalue q and one eigenvalue
−q −1 . Thus, either                                        −1        
                                q      0                       −q      0
                         N=                       or    N=                 .
                                0 −q −1                          0     q
However, neither of these matrices satisfies the relation N ρ(T2 )N = ρ(T2 )N ρ(T2 ). This contradic-
tion shows that the representation ρ cannot be extended to be a representation of H̃(G2 ).

     In spite of the fact, demonstrated by the previous example, that there does not always exist a
surjective algebra homomorphism from the affine Hecke algebra onto its Iwahori-Hecke subalgebra,
there are interesting surjective homomorphisms from affine Hecke algebras of exceptional type.

        Let N be a (finite dimensional) left R-module. For each g ∈ G define an R-module g N , which has
        the same underlying vector space N but such that

        simple if and only if N is simple. Thus there is an action of G on the set of simple R-modules.

Theorem A.6. (Clifford theory) Let Rλ be a simple R-module and let H be the inertia group of
Rλ . Let H µ be a simple (CH)α−1 -module where α: H × H → C∗ is the factor set determined by
a choice of isomorphisms φh : Rλ → h Rλ . Define an action of R ⋊ H on Rλ ⊗ H µ as in (A.5) and
define
                    RGλ,µ = IndR⋊G     λ     µ                      λ

Then
(a) RGλ,µ is a simple R ⋊ G-module.
(b) Every simple R ⋊ G-module is obtained by this construction.
(c) If RGλ,µ ∼
             = RGν,γ then Rλ and Rν are in the same G-orbit of simple R-modules and H µ ∼
                                                                                        = Hγ

Proof. The proof of this theorem is as in [Mac2] except that the consideration of the factor set
α: H × H → C∗ is necessary to correct an error there. We thank P. Deligne for pointing this out
to us. A sketch of the proof is as follows.
     Let M be a simple R⋊G-module
                        P               and let Rλ be a simple R-submodule of M . Then gRλ ∼
                                                                                           = g Rλ
as R-modules and M = g∈G gRλ since the right hand side is an R ⋊ G-submodule of M . Then
                           X                                               X
                   M=              gi N = IndR⋊G
                                             R⋊H (N ),      where N =            hRλ ,
                         gi ∈G/H                                           h∈H


and the first sum is over a set {gi } of coset representatives of the cosets G/H.
    The R-module N is semisimple and by [Bou2]

                                            N∼
                                             = Rλ ⊗ H µ ,                                   (A.7)

where H µ = HomR (Rλ , N ). It can be checked that the vector space H µ has a (CH)α−1 -action
given by
             (ch ψ)(m) = α(h, h−1 )hψ(φh−1 (m)), for h ∈ H, ψ ∈ HomR (Rλ , N ),
where ch is as in (A.4). Then, with R ⋊ H-action on Rλ ⊗ H µ given by (A.5), the isomorphism in
(A.7) is an isomorphism of R ⋊ H-modules (see [CR, Thm. (11.17) (ii)]).

     If P is an (CH)α−1 -submodule of H µ then Rλ ⊗ P is an R ⋊ H-submodule of Rλ ⊗ H µ and
IndR⋊G
   R⋊H (R
          λ
             ⊗ P ) is an R ⋊ G-submodule of M . Thus H µ must be a simple (CH)α−1 -module.
     This argument shows that every simple R ⋊ G-module is of the form RGλ,µ . The uniqueness
follows as in [Mac2, App.].


Remark A.8. A different choice ψh : Rλ → h Rλ of the isomorphisms in (A.3) may yield a factor
set β: H × H → C∗ which is different from the factor set α. However, the algebras (CH)β−1 and
(CH)α−1 are always isomorphic (a diagonal change of basis suffices).

Lemma A.9. Define RG = {r ∈ R | g(r) = r for all g ∈ G} and let e = (1/|G|)                 g∈G   g ∈ R ⋊ G.
(a) The map
                                θ: RG −→ e(R ⋊ G)e
                                     s 7−→           se
    is a ring isomorphism.
(b) Left multiplication by elements of R and the action of G by automorphisms make R into a
    left R ⋊ G-module. Right multiplication makes R a right RG -module. The rings R ⋊ G and
    e(R ⋊ G)e act on (R ⋊ G)e by left and right multiplication, respectively. The map

                                           ψ: R            ∼
                                                           =   (R ⋊ G)e
                                              r          7−→      re

    is an isomorphism of (R ⋊ G, RG )-bimodules.

Proof. (a) If r ∈ RG then

                                        1 X           1 X
                              ere =         g(r)ge =      re = re.
                                       |G|           |G|
                                           g∈G                   g∈G


Thus the map θ is well defined and if r, s ∈ RG then rese = rse, so θ is a homomorphism.
                                                                                       P      If
re = se then r = s since R ⋊ G is a free R-module with basis G. Thus θ is injective. If g∈G rg g
is a general element of R ⋊ G then

                    P
and, for each g ∈ G, h∈G h(rg ) ∈ RG . So θ is surjective.
    The proof of (b) is straightforward.

    Let (CH)α be the algebra with basis {bh | h ∈ H} and multiplication given by

                                  bg bh = α(g, h)bgh ,         for g, h ∈ H,

and let (CH)α−1 be as in (A.4). Let M be a (CH)α -module. The dual of M is the (CH)α−1 -module
given by the vector space M ∗ = Hom(M, C) with action

                   (ch ψ)(m) = α(h, h−1 )−1 ψ(bh−1 m),             for h ∈ H, ψ ∈ M ∗ .
26                                  A. Ram      and       J. Ramagge

This is a (CH)α−1 action since, for all g, h ∈ H, ψ ∈ M ∗ ,

            (cg ch ψ)(m) = α(h, h−1 )−1 α(g, g −1 )−1 ψ(bh−1 bg−1 m)
                         = α(h, h−1 )−1 α(g, g −1 )−1 α(h−1 , g −1 )ψ(b(gh)−1 m)
                         = α(h, h−1 )−1 α(g, g −1 )−1 α(h−1 , g −1 )α(gh, h−1 g −1 )(cgh ψ)(m)
                         = α(g, h)−1 (cgh ψ)(m),

where the last equality follows from the associativity of the product bg bh bh−1 bg−1 in (CH)α . If
ρ: (CH)α → End(M ) is the representation corresponding to M then the representation ρ∗ : (CH)α−1 →
End(M ∗ ) corresponding to M ∗ is

                            ρ∗ (ch ) = α(h, h−1 )−1 ρ(bh−1 )t = (ρ(bh )−1 )t .                   (A.10)

     If M is a (CH)α -module and N is a (CH)α−1 -module then M ⊗ N is an CH-module with
action defined by

                    h(m ⊗ n) = bh m ⊗ ch n,          for h ∈ H, m ∈ M and n ∈ N .                (A.11)

The following lemma is a version of Schur’s lemma which will be used in the proof of Theorem A.13.
                                                                          ∗
Lemma A.12. Suppose that M and N are simple     P (CH)α -modules and let N be the (CH)α−1 -
module which is the dual of N . Let eH = (1/|H|) h∈H h. Then
                                                        
                                                ∗           1,   if M ∼
                                                                      = N,
                              dim(eH (M ⊗ N )) =
                                                            0,   otherwise.


Proof. Identify M ⊗ N ∗ with Hom(N, M ). Then, by (A.10) and (A.11), the action of CH on
Hom(N, M ) is given by,

                    hA = ρ(bh )Aρ(bh )−1 ,       for h ∈ H and A ∈ Hom(N, M ),

where ρ: (CH)α → End(M ) is the representation corresponding to M . If A ∈ Hom(N, M ) and
g ∈ H then
                     eH A = geH A = g(eH A) = ρ(bg )(eH A)ρ(bg )−1 ,
and so ρ(bg )(eH A) = (eH A)ρ(bg ) for all g ∈ H. Then, by Schur’s lemma, eH A = 0 if M ∼
                                                                                        6 N and
                                                                                         =
eH A is a constant if M = N .


Theorem A.13. Let Rλ be a simple R-module and let H be the inertia group of Rλ . The ring RG
acts on Rλ (by restriction) and (CH)α acts on Rλ (by the R-module isomorphisms φh : Rλ ∼
                                                                                       = h Rλ
of (A.3)) and these two actions commute. Thus there is a decomposition
                                              M
                                      Rλ ∼
                                         =           Rλ,ν ⊗ (H ν )∗ ,
                                             ν∈Ĥα


where Ĥα is an index set for the simple (CH)α -modules, (H ν )∗ is the dual of the simple (CH)α−1 -
module H ν , and Rλ,ν is an RG -module.

(a) If Rλ,µ 6= 0 then it is a simple RG -module.
(b) Every simple RG -module is isomorphic to some Rλ,µ .
(c) The nonzero Rλ,µ are pairwise nonisomorphic.

Proof. The setup of Lemma A.9(b) puts us in the situation of [Gr, §6.2]. If e is the idempotent
used in Lemma A.9 then the functor

                              R ⋊ G-modules −→              RG -modules
                                   M        7−→                 eM

is an exact functor such that if M is a simple R ⋊ G-module then eM is either 0 or a simple RG -
module. Furthermore, every simple RG -module arises as eM for some simple R ⋊ G-module M .
     Let RGλ,µ be a simple R ⋊ G-module as given by Theorem A.6. From the definition of RGλ,µ
we obtain
                          eRGλ,µ = e(R ⋊ G) ⊗R⋊H (Rλ ⊗ H µ )
                                 = e ⊗ (Rλ ⊗ H µ ) = eeH ⊗ (Rλ ⊗ H µ )
                                 = e ⊗ eH (Rλ ⊗ H µ ),
                      P
where eH = (1/|H|) h∈H h. Using the decomposition in the statement of the Theorem, we
conclude that, as RG -modules,
                                                                         
                                              M
                       eRGλ,µ = e ⊗ eH              Rλ,ν ⊗ (H ν )∗ ⊗ H µ 
                                              ν∈Ĥ
                                                                             
                                              M
                               = e ⊗ eH             Rλ,ν ⊗ eH ((H ν )∗ ⊗ H µ )
                                              ν∈Ĥ
                               ∼
                               = Rλ,µ .

The last isomorphism is a consequence of Lemma A.12. The statement of the Theorem now follows
from the results of J.A. Green quoted above.
Remark A.14. It follows from Theorem A.13 that Rλ is semisimple as an RG -module and the
action of (CH)α on Rλ generates EndRG (Rλ ).
