                                                The Ado theorem is a fundamental fact, which has a reputation to be a ’strange theorem’. We
                                             give its natural proof.
                                                1. Construction of faithful representation. Consider a finite-dimensional Lie algebra g.
                                             Assume that g is a semidirect product p ⋉ n of a subalgebra p and a nilpotent ideal n. Assume that
                                             the adjoint action of p on n is faithful, i.e., for any z ∈ p, there exists x ∈ n such that [z, x] 6= 0.
                                                Consider the minimal k such that all the commutators
                                                                                   [. . . [[x1 , x2 ], x3 ], . . . , xk ],   xj ∈ n
                                             are 0.
                                                 Denote by U (n) the enveloping algebra of n. The algebra n acts on U (n) by the left multipli-
                                             cations. The algebra p acts on U (n) by the derivations
                                                        dz x1 x2 x3 . . . xl = [z, x1 ]x2 x3 . . . xl + x1 [z, x2 ]x3 . . . xl + . . . ,   where z ∈ p.
                                             This defines the action of the semidirect product p ⋉ n = g on U (n).
                                                Denote by I the subspace in U (n) spanned by all the products x1 x2 . . . xN , where N > k + 2.
                                             Obviously,
                                                1. I is the two-side ideal in U (n).
                                                2. Consider the linear span A of all the elements having the form 1, x, x1 x2 ∈ U (n). Obviously,
                                             I ∩ A = 0.
                                                3. I is invariant with respect to the derivations dz .
                                                Obviously, the module U (n)/I is a finite-dimensional faithful module over g.
                                                2. The Ado theorem.
                                                Lemma 1. Any finite-dimensional Lie algebra q admits an embedding to an algebra g such that
                                                a) g is a semidirect product of a reductive subalgebra p and a nilpotent ideal n;
                                                b) the action of p on n is completely reducible.
                                                Obviously, Lemma 1 implies the Ado theorem. Indeed, g admits a decomposition
                                                                                                 g = p′ ⊕ (p′′ ⋉ n)
                                             where p′ , p′′ are reductive subalgebras and the action of p′′ on n is faithfull. After this, it is
                                             sufficient to apply the construction of p.1.
                                                 Remark. The Ado theorem implies Lemma 1 modulo the Chevalley construction of algebraic
                                             envelope of a Lie algebra. But Lemma 1 itself can be easily proved directly.
                                                 3. Killing lemma. Let g be a Lie algebra, let d be its derivation. For an eigenvalue λ, denote
                                             by gλ its root subspace gλ = ∪k ker(d − λ)k ; we have g = ⊕gλ . As it was observed by Killing,
                                             x ∈ gλ , y ∈ gµ implies [x, y] ∈ gλ+µ .
                                                 Thus the Lie algebra g admits the gradation by the eigenvalues of d. Consider the gradation
                                             operator ds : g → g defined by ds v = λv if v ∈ gλ . Obviously, ds is a derivation, and dds = ds d.
                                             We also consider the derivation dn := d − ds , this operator is nilpotent (the equality d = dn + ds
                                             is called the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition). Clearly,
                                                                                     ker ds ⊃ ker d;               ker dn ⊃ ker d;                        (1)
                                                                                    im ds ⊂ im ds ;                im dn ⊂ im ds                          (2)
                                                 4. Elementary expansions. Let q be a Lie algebra, let I be an ideal of codimension 1. Let
                                             x∈/ I. Denote by d the operator Adx : I → I. Consider the corresponding pair of derivations ds ,
                                             dn . Consider the space
                                                                                    q′ = Cy + Cz + I

                                                                                                              1
where y, z are formal vectors. We equip this space with a structure of a Lie algebra by the rule

                   [y, z] = 0,     [y, u] = ds u,       [z, u] = dn u,   for all u ∈ I

and the commutator of u, v ∈ I is the same as it was in I.
    The subalgebra C(y + z) ⊕ I ⊂ q′ is isomorphic q. We say that q′ is an elementary expansion
of q.
    Obviously, [q′ , q′ ] = [q, q].
    For a general Lie algebra, the required embedding to a semidirect product can be obtained by
a sequence of elementary expansions.
    5. Proof of Lemma 1. Let q be a Lie algebra. Let h be its Levi part, and r be the radical.
Denote by m the nilradical of q, i.e., m = [q, r]; recall that m is a nilpotent ideal, and [q, q] = h ⋉ m
(see [1], 1.4.9).
    Consider a nilpotent ideal n of q containing the nilradical m. Consider a subalgebra p ⊃ h such
that the adjoint action of p on q is completely reducible and p ∩ n = 0; for instance, the can choice
n = m, p = h.
    Obviously, the q-module q/(p ⋉ n) is trivial. Consider any subspace I of codimension 1 con-
taining p ⋉ n, obviously I is an ideal in q. Since the action of p on q is completely reducible, there
exists a p-invariant complementary subspace for I. Let x be an element of this subspace. Since
the p-module q/I is trivial, x commutes with p. We apply the elementary expansion to these data.
    We obtain the new algebra q′ = Cy + Cz + I with the nilpotent ideal n′ = Cz + n and with the
reductive subagebra p′ = Cy ⊕ p (by (1), y commutes with p).
    It remains to notice that

                        dim q′ − dim p′ − dim n′ = dim q − dim p − dim n − 1

and we can repeat the same construction.
