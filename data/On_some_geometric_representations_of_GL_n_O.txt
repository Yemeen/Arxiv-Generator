                                                    Abstract. We study a family of complex representations of the group GLn (o), where o is
                                                    the ring of integers of a non-archimedean local field F . These representations occur in the
                                                    restriction of the Grassmann representation of GLn (F ) to its maximal compact subgroup
                                                    GLn (o). We compute explicitly the transition matrix between a geometric basis of the
                                                    Hecke algebra associated with the representation and an algebraic basis which consists of
                                                    its minimal idempotents. The transition matrix involves combinatorial invariants of lattices
                                                    of submodules of finite o-modules. The idempotents are p-adic analogs of the multivariable
                                                    Jacobi polynomials.


                                                                                      1. Introduction
                                            1.1. Outline. Let F be a non-archimedean local field and o its ring of integers. Let kF be the
                                            residue field and p the maximal ideal of o. For ℓ ∈ N, let oℓ denote the finite quotient o/pℓ .
                                            The group GLn (F ) acts transitively on Gr(m, n, F ), the Grassmannian of m-dimensional
                                            subspaces of a fixed n-dimensional space, giving rise to a complex representation of GLn (F )
                                            on L2 (Gr(m, n, F )). This work is about the restriction of this representation to the max-
                                            imal compact subgroup GLn (o). Since the irreducible constituents of this representation
                                            are contained in S(Gr(m, n, F )) ⊂ L2 (Gr(m, n, F )), the dense subspace of locally constant
                                            functions, we focus on the latter and call it the Grassmann representation of GLn (o). The
                                            Grassmann representation has a multiplicity free decomposition to irreducible representa-

                                            where Λm stands for partitions of at most m parts, see [BO]. Each irreducible constituent
                                            UλF contains a unique (normalized) Px -spherical vector eFλ , where Px is a stabilizer of a point
                                            x ∈ Gr(m, n, F ). These functions are the non-archimedean analogs of the multivariable Ja-
                                            cobi polynomials which arise in the analogous setup when F is either R or C, and will there-
                                            fore be called the p-adic multivariable Jacobi functions. Algebraically, after the appropriate
                                            normalization, they form a basis of the Hecke algebra Hm = EndGLn (o) S(Gr(m, n, F ))
                                            which consists of minimal idempotents. The algebra Hm can be identified with the con-
                                            volution algebra S(Px \GLn (o)/Px ) of bi-Px -invariant locally constant functions on GLn (o).
                                            The latter description comes with a natural geometric basis: characteristic functions of the

matrix between these geometric and algebraic bases (Theorem 7).
  The Grassmann representation is filtered by the finite dimensional Iℓ -invariant subspaces

where Iℓ = Ker{GLn (o) → GLn (oℓ )}. In fact, S(Gr(m, n, F )) = lim S(Gr(m, n, F ))Iℓ , hence
                                                                     −→
the problem can be translated into a finite problem: analysis of the representation of the finite
group GLn (oℓ ) in S(Gr(m, n, F ))Iℓ . The latter can in turn be identified with C(Gr(m, n, oℓ )),
the space of complex valued functions on the (finite) Grassmannian of free oℓ -submodules of
rank m in onℓ , with its natural GLn (oℓ )-action.
1.2. Context of the problem. To put things into perspective, we briefly describe the
archimedean [JC] and quantum [DS] counterparts of the Grassmann representation, see also
[Onn, OS] for more details. These are representations of the orthogonal group On arising
from its action on Gr(m, n, R), of the unitary group Un arising from its action on Gr(m, n, C),
and of the quantized enveloping algebra Uq (gln ) on the quantum Grassmanian [DS]. They all
have similar decompositions to (1), indexed by the same set Λm , giving rise to zonal spherical
functions eRλ and eCλ , which are special cases of the multivariable Jacobi polynomials, and eqλ
which are known as the multivarable little q-Jacobi polynomials [Sto].
   In [Sto, SK] it is shown that by taking appropriate limits, the multivariable q-Jacobi
polynomials eqλ degenerate to the multivariable Jacobi polynomials which specialize to eRλ
and eCλ , and in [Onn] it is further shown that they degenerate to the p-adic multivariable
Jacobi functions eFλ which are studied in the present paper (see also [Har] and [KO] for the
projective space case). Besides the aesthetic nature of these limits, in which the quantum
zonal spherical functions degenerate to the zonal spherical functions over all local fields,
archemedeans and non-archimedeans, they have been used in [OS] to compute the dimensions
of the irreducible constituents in (1), and no other direct computation is known at present.
   In a different direction, the multivariable p-adic Jacobi functions generalize the q-Hahn
polynomials for q = |o/p| = |kF | (see e.g. [GR] for the precise definition), which under the
appropriate interpretation coincide with eFλ , for λ = (1j ) with 0 ≤ j ≤ m. These functions
form a basis of EndGLn (kF ) C(Gr(m, n, kF )), which captures the first term in the filtration (2).
See [Del, Dun] for more details on this special case.
   The irreducible representations UλF are studied in [BO] in great detail. Their precise
identification involves the study a wider family of geometric representations of the group
GLn (oℓ ) which arise from its action on Gr(λ, onℓ ), the Grassmannian of submodules of onℓ
of type λ. Isomorphism types of submodules of onℓ are classified by partitions, which is the
underlying reason behind the appearance of Λm in (1).
1.3. Content of the paper. Section 2 is devoted to representations and Hecke algebra
which arise from the action of the finite quotients GLn (oℓ ) on Grassmannians of submodules
of onℓ . The main tools, i.e. geometrically defined intertwining operators, are described and
developed. Most of this section is an adaptation of relevant results and ideas from [BO]
which is the foundational background for this work.
   Sections 3 and 4 are devoted to transition matrices between various bases of the Hecke
algebras. The main tools which are used are combinatorial invariants of the lattice of sub-
modules in free oℓ -modules, the Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex associated with
flags of submodules, and explicit computations with q-binomial coefficients.
                                                 2
  In section 5 the finite results are transferred to S(Gr(m, n, F )) and its Hecke algebra Hm .
Special attention is given to the limiting process from the algebraic and topological aspects.
  Section 6 is devoted to related topics and open problems. In the appendix several claims
on modules over discrete valuation rings are proved, which we suspect to be known, but
could not find an adequate reference.

             2. Hecke algebras associated to finite Grassmannians
    Let oℓ = o/pℓ and let Gℓn denote the automorphism group of a free oℓ -module of rank n.
Upon a choice of a basis Gℓn can be identified with GLn (oℓ ). Recall that any finitely generated
oℓ -module is isomorphic to oλ = ⊕ri=1 o/pλi for some λ = (λi ) where ℓ ≥ λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λr ≥ 0
since o is a discrete valuation ring. We call λ the (isomorphism) type of that module. The
length of the partition λ, i.e. the number of its nonzero parts, is the rank of the module oλ ,
and the height of a partition is its largest part. The set of partitions of length at most m is
denoted Λm . The set of types is equipped with a natural partial order: µ ≤ ν whenever a
module of type µ can be embedded in a module of type ν. In terms of the corresponding
Young diagrams it amounts to inclusion of the corresponding diagrams. Here and in the
sequel we follow the notations of [Mac, II.1].
    In this section we analyze representations and Hecke algebras which arise from Grassman-
nians of submodules of the free oℓ -module of rank n. On one hand they generalize the case
ℓ = 1 which is studied in [Dun], and on the other hand they form the crucial ingredient for
understanding the Grassmann representation S (Gr(m, n, F )) of GLn (o).

2.1. Definition and realization of the Hecke algebra. Let L(onℓ ) denote the lattice of
submodules of onℓ . The group Gℓn acts on the lattice L(onℓ ) which is a disjoint union of the
Gℓn -invariant subsets
                    Xλ = Gr(λ, onℓ ) = {x ∈ L(onℓ ) | x ≃ oλ }    (λ ∈ Λℓn ),
where Λℓn = {λ ∈ Λn | height(λ) ≤ ℓ} stands for isomorphism types of elements in L(onℓ ).
Let τ : L(onℓ ) → Λℓn be the type map which assigns to each module its isomorphism type.
  For each λ ∈ Λℓn , let Fλ = C(Xλ ) be the complex permutation representation of Gℓn
arising from its action on Xλ . We equip Fλ with the inner product associated to the counting
measure on Xλ . The following claim, which will be proved in §5, highlights the relevance of
the representations Fλ with λ = (ℓm ) = (ℓ, . . . , ℓ).
Claim 2.1. There exist an isomorphism of GLn (o)-representations
                                S (Gr(m, n, F )) ≃ lim Fℓm .
                                                   −→
  Apart from their role in Claim 2.1, the representations Fℓm are distinguished among all
Fλ since
   (a) They are multiplicity free, and
   (b) The number of their irreducible constituents is |Λℓm | = ℓ+m
                                                                     
                                                                  m
                                                                       , in particular, it is
       independent of o.
                                                3
This is proved in [BO] in greater generality, but in order to be as self contained as possible
we shall explain it in detail. Let
                                          Hℓm = EndGℓn (Fℓm )
stand for the (Hecke) algebra of Gℓn -invariant endomorphisms of Fℓm . Assertions (a) and
                                                                                               ℓ
(b) would follow once we show that the algebra Hℓm is isomorphic to the algebra CΛm of
complex valued functions on Λℓm with pointwise multiplication. To prove that, we look at an
alternative description of Hℓm which is of geometric flavor. The algebra EndC (Fℓm ) can be
identified with C(Xℓm ×Xℓm ) by interpreting anyP function f : Xℓm ×Xℓm → C as a summation
kernel Tf : Fℓm → Fℓm , that is, Tf (h)(x) = y∈Xℓm f (x, y)h(y). The map f 7→ Tf is just
the identification of matrices with endomorphisms, which is also equivariant with respect to
the natural Gℓn -action on both algebras: [g · T ](h) = g(T (g −1h)) and [g · f ](x, y) = f (gx, gy)
for g ∈ Gℓn , T ∈ Fℓm , and f ∈ C(Xℓm × Xℓm ). Taking Gℓn -invariants gives
(3)                                    Hℓm ≃ C(Xℓm ×Gℓn Xℓm ).
Claim 2.2. For m ≤ n/2 there exist a bijection
                                                         ∼
                                     Xℓm ×Gℓn Xℓm −→ Λℓm
                                            Gℓn (x, y) 7−→ τ (x ∩ y),
Proof. The fact that Gℓn preserves the module structure implies that this map is well defined.
It is onto due to the assumption m ≤ n/2 which gives enough room to realize any type λ as
intersection of two oℓ -modules of type ℓm . It is one-to-one because any abstract isomorphism
between x ∩ y and x′ ∩ y ′ can be lifted to an element g ∈ Gℓn such that (x′ , y ′ ) = (gx, gy),
using
Lemma 2.3. Let z ⊂ E and z ′ ⊂ E ′ be modules such that z ≃ z ′ and E ≃ E ′ ≃ ojℓ . Then
any isomorphism of oℓ -modules z → z ′ can be extended to an isomorphism E → E ′ .
Proof. The ring oℓ is self injective1, therefore, the module ojℓ is injective, and hence the
                ∼
embedding z → z ′ ֒→ E ′ can be extended to a map E → E ′ . It is easy to see that among
such extensions exist one-to-one extensions which must be surjective as well due to the
finiteness of oℓ .                                                                        
   Going back to the argument above, the isomorphism x∩y ≃ x′ ∩y ′ can be (simultaneously)
extended to isomorphisms x ≃ x′ and y ≃ y ′ by using the lemma for j = m. These two
isomorphisms glue to an isomorphism x + y ≃ x′ + y ′ , which by using the lemma once more
for j = n, proves the claim.                                                            
Corollary 1. The algebra Hℓm is semisimple, commutative and of dimension |Λℓm |, hence
                                                             ℓ
(4)                                            Hℓm ≃ CΛm .
                                                                                        ℓ
Proof. Given the bijection of Claim 2.2 we get that both Hℓm and CΛm have the same
dimension: |Λℓm | = |{isomorphism types of submodules of om   ℓ }|. Both are semisimple, thus
the only non obvious issue is the commutativity of the algebra Hℓm , which follows from
Gelfand’s trick. That is, we have that (x, y) and (y, x) are in the same Gℓn -orbit since
τ (x ∩ y) = τ (y ∩ x), hence the identity is an anti-isomorphism of the algebra.           
  1This   is well known, but can also be easily verified using Baer’s criterion which reduces the injectivity
verification to a trivial calculation.
                                                     4
   It will be convenient to denote from now on φ = ℓm and Φ = ℓn . To make the link
with the terminology of [BO], note that Lemma 2.3 shows that rectangular types such as
φ and Φ are symmetric (Definition 2.1 in loc. cit.), and Claim 2.2 shows that (φ, Φ) form
a symmetric couple (Definition 2.2 in loc. cit.), provided that m ≤ n/2, which is our
assumption throughout.
   Using the isomorphisms (3) and (4), we obtain two natural bases for Hφ . The first, which
comes from the r.h.s of (3), consists of the operators corresponding to characteristic functions
of the orbits {gλ | λ ≤ φ}, and will be call the geometric basis, and the second, which comes
from the r.h.s of (4), consists of idempotents {eλ | λ ≤ φ}, and will be called the algebraic
basis. The precise meaning of the indexing of the algebraic basis will follow from Theorem
2 below. In order to connect these bases we need a fine analysis of intertwining operators
which is the theme of the next subsection.
2.2. Geometric intertwiners and bases for the Hecke algebra. Define the following
operators
    (a) For each pair of types λ ≤ µ let
                                                     X
                  Tµ≻λ : Fλ → Fµ ,       Tµ≻λ h(y) =   h(x) (y ∈ Xµ )
                                                           x⊂y
                                                       X
                  Tλ≺µ : Fµ → Fλ ,       Tλ≺µ h(x) =             h(y)   (x ∈ Xλ ).
                                                       y⊃x

   (b) For types λ, µ ≤ ν, let Tλ֒→ν←֓µ : Fµ → Fλ be the operator
                                           X
                     Tλ֒→ν←֓µ h(x) =                h(y)    (x ∈ Xλ ).
                                      {y∈Xµ | τ (y+x)=ν}


   (c) The aforementioned operators gλ ∈ Hφ (λ ≤ φ) are explicitly defined by
                                     X
                       gλ h(x) =            h(y)     (x ∈ Xφ ).
                                     {y | τ (y∩x)=λ}

   Note that all these operators commute with the GΦ -action, and that Tµ≻λ and Tλ≺µ form
an adjoint pair. In order to minimize confusion, we follow the rule that whenever an operator
is labeled with a diagram (e.g. Tλ֒→ν←֓µ ), it acts from the space indexed by the right type of
the diagram (Fµ ) to the space indexed by the left type (Fλ ).
  In order to find the transition matrix between the geometric basis {gλ } and the algebraic
basis {eλ } of Hφ , we introduce a third basis which is defined by cλ = Tφ≻λ Tλ≺φ (λ ≤ φ), and
will be called the cellular basis. The geometric basis can be viewed as averaging operators
along ‘spheres’, whereas the cellular basis can be viewed as weighted averaging operators on
‘balls’. More specifically, the following upper triangular relation holds [BO, §3.4.2]
                                              X ν 
(c-g)                                   cλ =           gν ,

                                                    λ

which in turn proves that {cλ } is indeed a basis. Here λν is the number of submodules of
                                                             
type λ contained in a module of type ν. For each λ ≤ φ set

Theorem 2. Hφλ and Hφλ are ideals ∀λ ≤ φ, hence, Kλ = Hφλ /Hφλ λ≤φ is a complete set
                                                       

of irreducible representations of Hφ .
Corollary 3. If eλ is the idempotent in Hφ corresponding to Kλ for all λ ≤ φ, then there
exist a lower triangular matrix (Aλκ ) such that
                                            X
(c-e)                                  cλ =      Aλκ eκ .
                                                κ≤λ

  The cellular basis appears as a bridge between the geometric and algebraic bases. It is
upper triangular with respect to the former and lower triangular with respect to the latter.
In the next subsection we shall use it to compute the idempotents explicitly.
Remark 1. Theorem 2 can be used to label the irreducible representations of Hφ . The one-
dimensional Hφ -module Kλ is the unique Hφ -module which is annihilated by all {Hφµ | µ < λ}
and not annihilated by Hφλ . In view of the well known dictionary between representations
of the group which occur in Fφ and modules of the Hecke algebra Hφ , we can now label
the irreducibles in Fφ by: Uλ ↔ Kλ . Moreover, by the definition of cλ as the composition
Tφ≻λ Tλ≺φ , the annihilation criterion above translates to the fact that Uλ occurs in Fλ and
does not occur in Fµ for µ < λ.

                   3. Transition matrix: cellular to geometric
  In this section we invert the relation (c-g) and compute it explicitly. It consists of two
parts, an abstract inversion using properties of the lattice of submodules and an explicit
calculation in terms of q-binomial coefficients, where q is the cardinality of the residue field
kF .

3.1. An abstract inversion. Two o-module monomorphisms i : x ֒→ y and i′ : x′ ֒→ y ′
are said to be equivalent if there are isomorphisms x ≃ x′ and y ≃ y ′ such that the following
diagram is commutative
                                             x ֒→ y
                                                  i
(5)                                         ↓     ↓
                                            x′ ֒→
                                                ′
                                                  y ′
                                                  i

Assuming the isomorphism types of x and y are λ and ν correspondingly,        we denote the
                                                            ν=ν
                                                                
equivalence class of i : x ֒→ y by i : λ ֒→ ν, and let i:λ֒→ν stand for the number of
submodules of type λ in a module of type ν with embedding type i.
  Let y be a finite module over o. Denote by L(y) the lattice of submodules of y. One
naturally associates a simplicial complex to y, denoted C(y), with vertices consisting of the
non-trivial submodules of y (all but 0 and y). The simplices of C(y) are given by flags
                       {(y1 , y2 , . . . , ym ) | 0 ⊂ y1 ⊂ y2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ ym ⊂ y}
We denote the Euler characteristic of C(y) by χ(y).
  For inverting the relation (c-g) we note that coefficients λν coincide with ζ̂(λ, ν) in the
                                                               

                                   i

We get

                                             λ ֒→ ν
                                                      i

The following Lemma shows that many of the terms in (6) vanish.
Lemma 3.1. If py 6= (0) then C(y) is contractible, in particular, χ(y) = 0.
Proof. Denote C = C(y), and D ⊆ C the subcomplex spanned by the subset of vertices
{x | py ⊆ x ⊂ y} ⊆ C0 . D is a cone over the vertex py, hence contractible. The function
                                ϕ : L(y) → L(y),          ϕ(x) = x + py
extends to a retraction ϕ∗ : C → D. The function
                        Ψ : C × [0, 1] → C           Ψ(c, t) = (1 − t)c + tϕ∗ (c)
establishes a deformation retract from C to D. Therefore C is contractible.                           
  The value of χ(y) depends only on the isomorphism type of y hence we shall use the
notation χ(λ) for λ ∈ Λn . The vanishing of χ(λ) when oλ is not a vector space will be
written in short as χ(λ) = 0 if pλ = 0.
3.2. Explicit calculation. It will be useful to use another set of coordinates for elements
in Λℓn , obtained by transposed diagrams λ′ = (λ′j ), defined by λ′j = |{i : λi ≥ j}|. The
module-theoretic interpretation of the λ′j ’s is given
                                                   in [Mac, II.1(1.4)]. For every partition ξ,
let n(ξ) = (i − 1)ξi and |ξ| = ξi . Let q = o/p = |kF |, and for m, n ∈ N set
            P                   P

                           [n]q = 1 − q −n ,            [0]q = 1,

                       [n]q ! = [n]q [n − 1]q · · · [1]q ,         =                 .

The subscript q will be occasionally omitted from the notation.

                  4. Transition matrix: cellular to idempotents
4.1. Abstract description. Let E be a fixed o-module of type Φ = ℓn . We say that two
submodules are transversal if their intersection is zero. Let κ, λ and µ be types of modules
and let xµ and xκ be two transversal submodules of E of types µ and κ respectively. Let
     • [µ ≺ λ̇ ⋔ κ]Φ be the number of submodules of type λ in F which contain xµ and are
        transversal to xκ .
     • [µ ≺ λ̇]Φ be the number of submodules of F of type λ which contain a given submodule
        of type µ (in the above notation this is [µ ≺ λ̇ ⋔ 0]Φ ).
Note that both [µ ≺ λ̇ ⋔ κ]Φ and [µ ≺ λ̇]Φ are well defined by Lemma 2.3.
  Since the cellular structure agrees with the idempotent decomposition, we already know
by Corollary 3 that there exist a lower triangular matrix Aλκ such that the relation (c-e)
above holds. We have already seen that the transition matrix (c-g) from the geometric basis
to the cellular basis depends only on geometric invariants of the lattice of submodules in a
very simple way. This is also the case for the cellular-idempotents transition matrix.
Theorem 4. Aλκ = [κ ≺ λ̇]φ [λ ≺ φ̇ ⋔ κ]Φ .
   Note that Theorem 4 is a generalization of [BO, Theorem 6] in which the same statement
is proved for λ’s with rectangular shape. Our strategy is to analyze the multiplication in the
                                                 ν
algebra with respect to the cellular basis. Let Bλµ be multiplication coefficients with respect
to the cellular basis

Observe that   Bλκ   = Aλκ for κ ≤ λ. The following lemma follows immediately from [BO,
Lemma 3.6].
Lemma 4.1.
  (1) Tφ≻κ Tκ≻ν = [ν ≺ κ̇]φ Tφ≻ν .
  (2) Tν≺κ Tκ≺φ = [ν ≺ κ̇]φ Tν≺φ .
Substituting cη = Tφ≻η Tη≺φ in equation (8) and using Lemma 4.1 gives (assume κ ≤ λ):
                                   
                    Tφ≻λ Tλ≺φ Tφ≻κ Tκ≺φ

                           = Tφ≻λ                           Tλ≻ν Tν≺κ Tκ≺φ
                                    ν≤κ
                                        [ν ≺ λ̇]φ [ν ≺ κ̇]φ
   Let Fλ• = Im(Tλ≺φ ). Observe that the set of maps ∆ = ∆λκ = {Tλ≻ν Tν≺κ }ν≤λ∧κ when
restricted to Fκ•, forms a basis for Gℓ -maps Fκ• → Fλ• . Indeed, these maps are independent
after being composed with Tφ≻λ on the left and Tκ≺φ on the right and using lemma 4.1. We
get the following identity on Fλ• :
                                                    ν

Denote the coefficient of an operator S w.r.t to a basis element D ∈ ∆ by hS, Di∆ .
                                               8
Definition 4.2. A triple κ ≤ λ ≤ η is called good if
                               hTλ≺η Tη≻κ , Tλ≻κ i∆ = [λ ≺ η̇ ⋔ κ]Φ
Combining Definition 4.2 with (10) we see that Theorem 4 is equivalent to:
Theorem 5. κ ≤ λ ≤ φ is a good triple.
  We would like to take a small pause and explain the strategy which we undertake. The
idea is to show that it is enough to find a path connecting λ and φ in the segment [λ, φ]
which can be paved with good triples, and then exhibit such path. More precisely, we follow
three steps:
    (1) Given λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λr ≤ φ such that κ ≤ λi−1 ≤ λi is good for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r and
        also κ ≤ λr ≤ φ is good, implies that so is κ ≤ λ0 ≤ φ.
    (2) κ ≤ λ1 ≤ λ2 is good whenever λ2 covers λ1 (i.e. [λ1 , λ2 ] = {λ1 , λ2 }) and has the same
        rank.
    (3) κ ≤ ǫ ≤ φ is good whenever ǫ and φ are symmetric.
Note that a Jordan-Hölder sequence of types from λ to a symmetric type ǫ of the same rank
gives an appropriate path: λ = λ0 ≤ · · · ≤ λr = ǫ ≤ φ.

Step 1
Lemma 4.3. If κ ≤ λ ≤ θ and κ ≤ θ ≤ φ are good so is κ ≤ λ ≤ φ.

  Using this lemma r times completes the proof of step 1. Note that the lemma can be used
successively only from the ’top’ to the ’bottom’.

Let λ1 and λ2 be types of same rank and assume that λ2 covers λ1 . Let κ ≤ λ1 . We want
to show that hTλ1 ≺λ2 Tλ2 ≻κ , Tλ1 ≻κ iΘ = [λ1 ≺ λ˙2 ⋔ κ]. However, the assumption that λ1 and
λ2 have the same rank guarantees that any module of type λ2 containing a module of type
λ1 which is transversal w.r.t. a module of type κ inherits this transversality. Hence, the
requirement to avoid κ is redundant and [λ1 ≺ λ˙2 ⋔ κ] = [λ1 ≺ λ˙2 ]. We start by expanding
the product Tλ1 ≺λ2 Tλ2 ≻κ :
(11)                     Tλ1 ≺λ2 Tλ2 ≻κ = aλ1 Tλ1 ֒→λ1 ←֓κ + aλ2 Tλ1 ֒→λ2 ←֓κ
                                                   9
The assumptions on λ1 and λ2 assures that no other terms appear in (11). Evidently Tλ1 ≻κ =
Tλ1 ֒→λ1 ←֓κ and aλ1 = [λ1 ≺ λ˙2 ]. We are therefore reduced to showing that the ∆ expansion of
the second term in (11) does not contain a multiple of Tλ1 ≻κ . This is accomplished by claim
4.4. Let κ1 be the unique type which can (possibly) complete a cartesian diagram (see the
first part of claim A.3 in appendix A):

Let w0 , x0 and y0 be submodules of F such that w0 ⊂ x0 ∩ y0 with types τ (w0 ) = κ1 ,
τ (x0 ) = κ and τ (y0 ) = φ. Define:
      B = Bx0 ,y0 ,w0 = {z|z ⊂ y0 , τ (z) = λ1 , τ (z + x0 ) = λ2 , z ∩ x0 = w0 }

             B = {z|w0 ⊂ z ⊂ y0 , τ (z) = λ1 , τ (pz + px0 ) = pλ2 , pz ∩ px0 = pw0 }
This description of B together with the symmetricity of y0 implies that |B| depends only on
the types of px0 and w0 , denote it by bpκ,κ1 . Applying the l.h.s. to δx0 yields:

Step 3
We should prove that the triple κ ≤ ǫ ≤ φ is good when both ǫ and φ are symmetric types.
This is precisely the assertion of [BO, Theorem 6]. In particular see relation (8) in the proof.
The only delicate point which deserves a remark, is the duality axiom which is used in the
proof and should be justified. Indeed, in a module of type κ, the number of submodules of
type α equals to the number of submodules of co-type α (cf. [Mac, II.1]).

Proof. A basic quantity, which all other quantities are scaled to, is the cardinality of Hom(oλ , oν )
which is denoted and computed by
                                                                              ′   ′

The subset of all injective morphisms will be denoted Hom1−1 (oλ , oν ) and we will use
                                               hom1−1 (λ, ν) = |Hom1−1 (oλ , oν )|
For a given type λ, hom1−1 (λ, λ) is computed in [Mac, II.1] where it is denoted aλ (q). A
similar computation shows that
                                        Y [νi′ − λ′i+1 ]!
                        hom1−1 (λ, ν) =        ′     ′

                                            [ν i − λ i ]!
Observe that the map
                                 Hom1−1 (oλ , oν ) → Gr(λ, oν ),                      ψ 7→ Im(ψ)

is hom        (λ, λ) to one, thus

                                   λ      hom1−1 (λ, λ)
and (1) follows. Given an o-module f of type φ, counting in two ways the size of the set
                                       {x, y < f | x < y, τ (x) = λ, τ (y) = ν}

which combined with (1) proves (2).

   In order to prove (3) we need a little preparation. Let E be a module of type Φ. Let
                                                                   ′
z < E be a fixed module of type λ. Denote by E1 a module of type ℓλ1 containing z. Observe
that E1 is a direct summand of E. Fix a complimentary direct summand to E2 such that
E = E1 ⊕ E2 . Denote the corresponding projections by p1 and p2 . Assume that a type ν is
given. Let
                              X = {x < E | τ (x) = ν, x ∩ z = 0},
in particular [ν̇ ⋔ λ] = |X|. Observe that the map
                                   Hom(oν , E1 ) ⊕ Hom1−1 (oν , E2 ) → X,
                                      (ψ1 , ψ2 ) 7→ Im(ψ1 + ψ2 )
        1−1
is hom        (ν, ν) to one. This map is indeed into X as
                       Im(ψ1 ⊕ ψ2 ) ∩ z ⊂ Im(ψ1 ⊕ ψ2 ) ∩ E1 ≃ Ker(ψ2 ) = (0).
It is onto X as for a given ψ ∈ Hom1−1 (oν , E), with Im(ψ) ∈ X we have Ker(p2 ◦ ψ) ≃
Im(ψ) ∩ E1 which is (0), as the p-torsion of E1 is equal to the p-torsion of z. We get that

                    5. From the finite Grassmannians to S(Gr(m, n, F ))
   Recall that Iℓ denotes the kernel of the reduction of GLn (o) modulo pℓ . The group GLn (o),
being the inverse limit of the finite groups Gℓn , enjoys the property that each of its continuous
irreducible complex representations has a level. That is, the first nonnegative integer ℓ such
that Iℓ+1 acts trivially. It follows that there exist a natural filtration
                (0) ⊂ S(Gr(m, n, F ))I1 ⊂ S(Gr(m, n, F ))I2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ S(Gr(m, n, F )).
The ℓ-th term in this filtration consists of all the irreducible components of the representation
which have level at most ℓ − 1, and thus can be regarded as a representation of Gℓn . Denote
this representation by ρ̄ℓm . Since each irreducible constituent is contained in some ρ̄ℓm , we
get
(12)                                        S(Gr(m, n, F )) ≃ lim ρ̄ℓm
                                                              −→
as GLn (o) representations.
Lemma 5.1. (ρ̄ℓm , S(Gr(m, n, F ))Iℓ ) ≃ (ρℓm , Fℓm ).
                                                             12
Proof. Follows from the natural identification
                 Iℓ \Gr(m, n, F ) ≃ Iℓ \GLn (F )/Pm (F ) ≃ GLn (oℓ )/Pm (oℓ ) ≃ Xℓm ,
where Pm is the appropriate parabolic group, and the isomorphism
                                S(Gr(m, n, F ))Iℓ ≃ C(Iℓ \Gr(m, n, F )).
                                                                                                            
  Consequently, combining (12) with Lemma 5.1 proves Claim 2.1. Note that the isomor-
phism in Lemma 5.1 is algebraic, and that there are two different inner products on ρℓm
and on ρ̄ℓm , arising from the counting measure on Xℓm or the projection of the (probability)
Haar measure from GLn (o) to Iℓ \Gr(m, n, F ), respectively. Throughout the finite analysis
we kept the former inner product, while at this stage of transferring the results to the infinite
Grassmann representation, we should keep track of the appropriate normalization.

and hence of all groups, spaces and algebras defined over it, summarized by

and explained in detail below.
5.1. Lifting the finite spaces, algebras and functions. Let πℓ : Xℓm → X(ℓ−1)m be the
natural quotient maps. As GLn (o)-spaces we have
                                   Gr(m, n, F ) ≃ lim Xℓm .
                                                  ←−
Using the identification in Claim 2.2, the maps πℓ descent to maps
                             πℓ : Λℓm → Λm
                                         ℓ−1
                                             ,              τ (oλ ) 7→ τ (oλ /pℓ−1 oλ )
which are easily described in transposed coordinates by
                                  (λ′1 , . . . , λ′ℓ−1 , λ′ℓ ) 7→ (λ′1 , . . . , λ′ℓ−1 ).
Consider the set ℓ≥0 Λℓm , and endow it with a graph structure by connecting each λ ∈ Λℓm
                    `
                         ℓ−1
with its image πℓ (λ) ∈ Λm   . This graph is a rooted tree, the root being the empty partition
in Λm . The inverse limit lim Λℓm can be identified with the space of ends of this tree. The

obvious sections Λm     → Λℓm given by (λ′1 , . . . , λ′ℓ−1 ) 7→ (λ′1 , . . . , λ′ℓ−1 , 0) give at the limit an
imbedding of Λm in lim Λℓm . Thus, Λm can be identified with an open and dense subset of
                      ←−
lim Λℓm . Let N stand for the one point compactification of N. Λm is naturally imbedded in
←−                                        m
Nm . We denote by Λm its closure in N . It is easily seen that Λm can be identified with
lim Λℓm . We summarize this discussion by

Proposition 5.2. Gr(m, n, F ) ×GLn (o) Gr(m, n, F ) ≃ Λm ≃ lim Λℓm .
                                                                         ←−
Proof. The only nontrivial issue left to address is the fact that the first identification is also
topological. The topology on the l.h.s is the quotient topology. The quotient map from
Gr(m, n, F ) × Gr(m, n, F ) to Xℓm × Xℓm is continuous and GLn (o)-equivariant. The limit
map becomes continuous and well-defined on the quotient.                                                      

Remark 5.3.
  (1) As topological spaces, Λm \ Λm ≃ Λm−1 , thus m
                                                   `
                                                      i=0 Λi is a stratification of Λm .
  (2) Gr(m, n, F ) carries a GLn (o)-invariant measure. Consequently, also does Λm ,
      and Λm is of full measure inside Λm . This measure is computed in [Onn, §2.2].

   The maps πℓ give rise to inclusions of the (finite dimensional) spaces iℓ : L2 (X(ℓ−1)m ) →
L (Xℓm ), where the notation F (X) is replaced by L2 (X) to emphasize that the inner product
 2

structure is induced from the Haar measure, rather than the counting measure. The adjoint
transformation, i∗ℓ , is the orthogonal projection on the Iℓ−1 invariants. In the limit we get
the vector space of Bruhat-Schwartz (=locally constant) functions:
                   S(Gr(m, n, F )) ≃ lim L2 (Gr(m, n, F ))Iℓ ≃ lim L2 (Xℓm ).
                                     −→                        −→

L (Gr(m, n, F )) is the completion S(Gr(m, n, F )), or alternatively, the direct limit in the
category of Hilbert spaces. The inclusions iℓ also give embeddings of the Hecke algebras
Hℓm = EndGℓn (L2 (Xℓm )) given by
                               H(ℓ−1)m → Hℓm ,          h 7→ iℓ ◦ h ◦ i∗ℓ .
Recall by (3) that as vector spaces Hℓm ≃ F (Λℓm ), and that under this isomorphism the
operator gλ ∈ Hℓm (λ ∈ Λℓm ) corresponds to the delta function δλℓ ∈ F (Λℓm) supported on λ.
Claim 5.4. If λ′ℓ−1 = 0 then iℓ ◦ δλℓ−1 ◦ i∗ℓ = δλℓ .
Proof. The condition λ′ℓ−1 = 0 implies that πℓ−1 (λ) is the singleton {λ} ⊂ Λm , and the claim
follows.                                                                                     
   It follows that the image of δλℓ inside lim Hℓm stabilizes for ℓ large enough, thus determining
                                           −→
an element δλ = lim δλℓ , where δλ is the delta function supported at λ, viewing λ as an element
                  −→
of Λ̄m via Λm ⊂ Λ̄m . The identifications of Proposition 5.2 give three ways to look at
                               Hm = EndGLn (o) (S(Gr(, m, n, F ))) ,
namely,                                                
              Hm ≃ S Gr(m, n, F ) ×GLn (o) Gr(m, n, F ) ≃ S(Λm ) ≃ lim Hℓm .
                                                                     −→
Here S(Λm ) is the space of locally constant functions on Λm . The limit algebra structure
obviously coincides with the operator algebra structure of S(Λm ), arising when viewing its
elements as convolution operators on S(Gr(m, n, F )). Denote by F (Λm ) the space of finitely
supported functions on Λm . As Λm is discrete in Λm , F (Λm ) is imbedded in S(Λm ). As
Λm is dense in Λm , F (Λm) is dense in S(Λm ) too. Consequently, the algebraic structure of
S(Λm ) is determined by F (Λm ) = Span{δλ : λ ∈ Λm }.
5.2. Transition matrices. We are finally in a position to collect the pieces, and write down
explicitly the transition matrix between the delta functions basis of Hm and the idempotents
of Hm . In order to do that we introduce an intermediate basis, which is the limit of the
(normalized image in Hm ) of the finite levels cellular bases. For λ ∈ Λm define
                                                   cλ
                                        c̄λ = lim Φ  ,
                                              −→
                                                   ℓ    φ
ḡλ the operator which corresponds to δλ , and ēλ the image of eλ in Hm . Combining the
results of §3-4 with the above discussion gives

                                  problems
6.1. Complexity of the representations Fλ . The focus of this paper is on the represen-
tations Fλ with λ = ℓm . They enjoy the property that their decomposition into irreducible
constituents is of combinatorial nature, in particular, independent of the ring o. For arbi-
trary (non-rectangular) types there is a strong dependence on the ring, and a highly non
trivial problem is
Problem 1. Decompose Fλ into irreducible constituents for any λ ∈ Λm .
    The nontriviality of the problem is demonstrated in the next proposition. Let B denote
the subgroup of upper triangular matrices in GLn (o ), that is, the stabilizer of a full flag of
o -free submodules in on .
Proposition 6.1. If all parts of λ ∈ Λn are pairwise unequal with smallest part λn =  and
                                                                 Gn
largest part λ1 = ℓ, then the Gℓn -representation Fλ contains IndB (1), where the action of
Gℓn on the latter is via reduction modulo p .
                                                       G   n
   To get an idea of the complexity of IndB (1), the reader is referred to [CN] in which the
case n = 3 is studied. Though we know very little about these arbitrary Grassmannians,
they can be used to pin down the irreducible representations which occur in the Grassmann
representation studied in the current paper: the essence of the labeling in (1) of §1 comes
from the following theorem.
Theorem 8. [BO] There exist a family UλF | λ ∈ Λm of irreducible representations of
                                                              	
GLn (o) such that

    (2) hUλF , Fµ i = |{λ ֒→ µ}|. I.e., the multiplicity of UλF in Fµ is the number of nonequiv-
        alent embeddings of a module of type λ in a module of type µ.
In particular UλF occurs both in S(Gr(m, n, F )) and in Fλ with multiplicity one, and does
not occur in Fµ for λ  µ.
                                                               15
6.2. Dimensions of UλF . The dimensions of the representations UλF were computed in [OS],
using a sophisticated and heavy computational machinery of degenerations of certain gen-
eralized quantum dimensions formulae to actual dimensions of the UλF ’s. They are given by
the following formula [OS, §4.3].

for λ ∈ Λn .                                                             Qj−1
   Here ∂λ′ = (λ′j − λ′j+1 )j≥0, ρ = (n − 1, n − 2, . . . , 0), (a; t)j = i=0 (1 − ti a) and t = |o/p|−1.
We used t instead of q to match the notation of [OS].
Problem 2. Compute the dimensions of UλF (λ ∈ Λm ) directly.
6.3. Heisenberg-like relations on the complete lattice of submodules. Let L denote
the lattice of submodules in onℓ and let Λ = Λℓn . Let F (L) = ⊕λ≤ℓn Fλ stand for complex
valued functions on L. For x, y ∈ L we use the notation y ⋗ x whenever y covers x (i.e. y/x
is simple). Define the following ’lowering’ and ’raising’ operators on F (L):
                    D♭ : F (L) → F (L)                               D♯ : F (L) → F (L)
                               X                                                X
                    D♭ f (x) =    f (y)                              D♯ f (x) =   f (y).
                                   y⋗x                                         y⋖x

Observe that D♭ and D♯ are adjoints. Indeed, this follows from D♭ =
                                                                                           P
                                                                                              µ⋖λ    Tµ≺λ and
D♯ = µ⋗λ Tµ≻λ .

Proposition 6.2. (D♭ D♯ − D♯ D♭ )|Fλ = bλ · IdFλ

Proof. Using the definition of D♭ and D♯ , we need to show that
                    XX             XX
                            h(z) −         h(z) = bλ · h(x)   ∀x ∈ Xλ
                         y⋗x z⋖y         y⋖x z⋗y

   For any subset Σ ⊂ Λ let ♯(Σ) be the set of types which covers types from Σ and ♭(Σ) the
set of types which are covered by types from Σ. For λ ∈ Λ let ♮(λ) = ♭♯(λ) = ♯♭(λ).
   First, we note that any y 6= x from τ −1 (♮λ), appears exactly once in each of the summands
on the left hand side. Indeed, there is exactly one submodule (their join) which covers both
of them, and exactly one submodule (their meet) which is covered by both of them. Hence
such pairs do not contribute to the left hand side.
   Second, y = x ∈ τ −1 (♮λ) appears uλ times in the first summand, and lλ times in the
second summand, where for a fixed z0 ∈ τ −1 (λ):
                          uλ = |{y|y ⋗ z0 }|                    lλ = |{y|y ⋖ z0 }|
It follows that bλ = uλ − lλ .                                                                             

  The scalars bλ can be easily computed. They are given by
                                                   q n−rkλ − q rkλ
                                          bλ =
                                                       q−1
                                                      16

6.4. More questions regarding the Hecke algebra Hℓm . The transition matricx (c-e)
is given explicitly by a combinatorial data (Theorem 4). Examples imply that this should
also be the case for the transition matrix (e-c), and it would be interesting to find such
interpretation.

Problem 3. Invert the relation (c-e).

   As mentioned in the introduction the case ℓ = 1 is well studied [Dun, Del]. In loco citato
the set X1m is studied as an association scheme (the q-Johnson scheme). The graph structure
is defined by: two points x, y ∈ X1m are connected with an edge if x ∩ y is of  P codimension
one in each of them. The Laplacian ∆ on this graph, defined by ∆h(x) = x∼y h(y) (for
h ∈ F1m ), is nothing but the operator g1m−1 . It turns out that ∆ generates the Hecke algebra,
i.e. H1m = C[∆]. The following is a conjectural generalization of this fact.

Problem 4. Prove that {g(ℓm−1 ,j 1 ) | j = 0, . . . , ℓ − 1} generate Hℓm as an algebra.

6.5. Other algebraic groups. The case ℓ = 1 admits generalizations to other algebraic
groups, see e.g. [Sta]. It would be interesting to generalize these further to other classical
groups, for example

Problem 5. Study the natural Grassmann representation of the symplectic group arising
from its action on Lagrangian subspaces of ℓ2n .



              Appendix A. Local rings and discrete valuation rings
   In this appendix we prove some claims regarding local rings. All modules under consider-
ation are assumed to be of finite rank. Let R be a local ring with a maximal ideal p and let
x, y be R-modules. Let x̄ = x/px. By Nakayama’s lemma x → y is onto if and only if the
induced map x̄ → ȳ is onto. Equivalently rk(x) = dim x/px.

Claim A.1. Let R be a local ring with maximal ideal p. Let z be an R-module and x, y two
submodules of z. Then:
                                                                   px ∩ py 
                   rk(x + y) = rk(x) + rk(y) − rk(x ∩ y) + dim
                                                                    p(x ∩ y)
                                                17
Proof. Using the equalities p(x+y) = px+py and p(x⊕y) = px⊕py, we obtain a commutative
diagram with exact columns and rows (14) and exact sequence (15):
                          0          0          0
                          ↓          ↓          ↓
                   0 → px ∩ py → px ⊕ py → px + py → 0
                          ↓          ↓          ↓
(14)               0 → x∩y     →   x⊕y   →   x+y → 0
                          ↓          ↓          ↓
                         x∩y        x⊕y       x+y
                   0 → px∩py   99K px⊕py 99K p(x+y) → 0
                          ↓          ↓          ↓
                          0          0          0
(the exactness of the dashed row follows from the obvious exactness of the other rows and
columns)

                             px ∩ py     x∩y        x∩y
(15)                    0→            →          →         →0
                             p(x ∩ y)   p(x ∩ y)   px ∩ py
and obtain:
                                     (14)                 x∩y
           rk(x) + rk(y) = rk(x ⊕ y) = rk(x + y) + dim
                                                         px ∩ py
                                     (15)
                                                                      px ∩ py 
                                     = rk(x + y) + rk(x ∩ y) − dim
                                                                      p(x ∩ y)
                                                                                         
Claim A.2. Let R be a local ring with maximal ideal p. Let z be an R-module and x, y two
submodules of z. Then:
              rk(x) = rk(x + y) ⇐⇒ rk(x ∩ y) = rk(y) and px ∩ py = p(x ∩ y)
Proof. (⇐) clear. (⇒) if rk(x) = rk(x + y) we have that the two non-negative terms rk(y) −
                   px∩py
rk(x ∩ y) and dim p(x∩y)    must sum up to zero.                                          
  We now specialize to the situation to which we apply these assertions.
Claim A.3. Let o be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal p. Let z be a finite o-
module and x, y two submodules of z. Assume that rk(x + y) = rk(x) and x + y covers
x.
   (1) τ (x ∩ y) depends only on τ (x), τ (y) and τ (x + y).
   (2) τ (x + y) = λ ⇐⇒ τ (px + py) = pλ, px ∩ py = p(x ∩ y) and p(x ∩ y) $ py.
Proof. One immediately verifies that for a module w, τ (w) = λ ⇔ dim w̄ = λ1 = rk(λ)
and τ (pw) = pλ.
   (1) There exist a unique i such that pi (x + y)/pi x 6= (0). By the isomorphism pi (x +
        y)/pix ≃ pi y/pi (x ∩ y) it is also the unique i for which pi y/pi (x ∩ y) 6= (0).
   (2) (⇒) Assume τ (x + y) = λ. Clearly τ (px + py) = pλ, and by Claim A.2 also px ∩ py =
        p(x ∩ y). Since x ∩ y $ y and have the same rank, the dimensions of x ∩ y and ȳ
        must be the same and p(x ∩ y) $ py.
                                            18
        (⇐) The data on the right together with claim A.2 implies that τ (p(x + y)) = pλ
        and rk(x + y) = rk(x). This implies that τ (x + y) = λ.
                                                                                       
