                                             0         Introduction
                                             To each real semisimple Jordan algebra, the Tits-Koecher-Kantor theory asso-
                                             ciates a distinguished parabolic subgroup P = LN of a semisimple Lie group
                                             G. The groups P which arise in this manner are precisely those for which N is
                                             abelian, and P is conjugate to its opposite P .
                                                 Each non-open L-orbit O on N ∗ admits an L-equivariant measure dµ which is
                                             unique up to scalar multiple. By Mackey theory, we obtain a natural irreducible
                                             unitary representation πO of P , acting on the Hilbert space

                                                                                 HO = L2 (O, dµ).

                                                     In this context, we wish to consider two problems:

                                                 1. Extend πO to a unitary representation of G.
                                                 2. Decompose the tensor products πO ⊗ πO′ ⊗ πO′′ ⊗ · · ·

                                                 If the Jordan algebra is Euclidean (i.e. formally real) then G/P is the Shilov
                                             boundary of a symmetric tube domain. In this case, the first problem was solved
                                             in [S1], [S2], where it was shown that πO extends to a unitary representation
                                             of a suitable covering group of G. The second problem was solved in [DS],
                                             where we established a correspondence between the unitary representations of
                                             G occurring in the tensor product, and those of a “dual” group G′ acting on
                                             a certain reductive homogeneous space. This correspondence agrees with the
                                             θ-correspondence in various classical cases, and also gives a duality between E7
                                             and real forms of the Cayley projective plane.
                                                 In this paper we start to consider these two problems for non-Euclidean
                                             Jordan algebras. The algebraic groundwork has already been accomplished in

                                                                                          1
[S3], however the analytical considerations are much more subtle, and here we
only treat the case of the representation π1 = πO1 corresponding to the minimal
L-orbit O1 .
    It turns out that in order for the first problem to have a positive solution,
one has to exclude certain Jordan algebras of rank 2. This is related to the
Howe-Vogan result on the non-existence of minimal representations for certain
orthogonal groups.
    To each of the remaining Jordan algebras we attach a restricted root system
Σ of rank n, where n is the rank of the Jordan algebra. The root multiplicities,
d and e, of Σ play a decisive role in our considerations. For the reader’s conve-
nience, we include a list of the corresponding groups G and the multiplicities in
the appendix.
    For these groups, we show that π1 extends to a spherical unitary represen-
tation of G, and that the spherical vector is closely related to the one variable
Bessel K-function Kτ (z), where

                                       d−e−1
                                  τ=         .
                                         2
    The function Kτ (z) can be characterized, up to a multiple, as the unique
solution of the modified Bessel equation

                                                   τ2
                          ψ ′′ + z −1 ψ ′ − (1 +      )ψ = 0

that decays (exponentially) as z → ∞; and, to us, one of the most delightful
aspects of the present consideration is the unexpected and uniform manner in
which this classical differential equation emerges from the structure theory of
G.
    More precisely, we establish the following result:
    We identify N with its Lie algebra n = Lie(N ) via the exponential map. We
also fix an invariant bilinear form on h·, ·i on g, which is a certain multiple of
the Killing form, normalized as in Definition 1.1 below. We use this form to
identify N ∗ with n = Lie(N ). For y in n, h−θy, yi is positive, and we define
                                      p
                                 |y| = h−θy, yi.


Theorem 0.1 π1 extends to a unitary representation of G with spherical vector
|y|−τ Kτ (|y|).

   Since π1 is spherical, its Langlands parameter is its infinitesimal character,
and this can be determined via the (degenerate) principal series imbedding
described in section 2 below. It is then straightforward to verify that π1 is the
minimal representation of G, with annihilator equal to the Joseph ideal. (For
G = GL(n), the minimal representation is not unique.)

                                          2
    Thus our construction should be compared to other realizations of the min-
imal representations in [Br], [T], [H] etc. Although our construction is for a
more restrictive class of groups, it does offer two advantages over the other con-
structions. The first advantage is that our construction works for a larger class
of representations, and the second advantage is that it is well-suited for tensor
product computations.
    Both of these features will be explored in detail in a subsequent paper. In
the present paper, we consider k-fold tensor powers of π1 , where k is strictly
smaller than n (rank of Σ), and show that the decomposition can be understood
in terms of certain reductive homogeneous spaces

                              Gk /Hk , 1 < k < n.

These spaces are defined in section 3, and are listed in the appendix.
   We consider also the corresponding Plancherel decomposition:
                                       Z ⊕
                        2
                       L (Gk /Hk ) =       m(κ)κ dµ(κ) ,
                                        bk
                                        G

where dµ is the Plancherel measure, and m(κ) is the multiplicity function. Then
we have
                                                                bk and G,
Theorem 0.2 For 1 < k < n, there is a correspondence θk between G      b
such that                   Z ⊕
                      ⊗k
                     π1 =       m(κ)θk (κ) dµ(κ).

1     Preliminaries
The results of this section are all well-known. Details and proofs may be found
in [S1], [KS] and in the references therein (in particular, [BK] and [Lo]).

1.1    Root multiplicities
Let G be a real simple Lie group and let K be a maximal compact subgroup
corresponding to a Cartan involution θ. We shall denote the Lie algebras of G,
K etc by g, k etc. Their complexifications will be denoted by lowercase fraktur
letters with subscript C . Fix θ, and let g = k + p be the associated Cartan
decomposition.
    The parabolic subgroups P = LN obtained by the Tits-Kantor-Koecher
construction are those such that N is abelian, and P is G-conjugate to its
opposite parabolic
                               P = θ(P ) = LN .


                                        3
In this case N has a natural structure of a real Jordan algebra, which is unique
up to a choice of the identity element.
    In (Lie-)algebraic terms, this means that P is a maximal parabolic subgroup
corresponding to a simple (restricted) root α which has coefficient 1 in the
highest root, and which is mapped to −α under the long element of the Weyl
group.
    In this situation, M := K ∩ L is a symmetric subgroup of K (this is equiv-
alent to the abelianness of N ), and we fix a maximal toral subalgebra t in the
orthogonal complement of m in k.
    The roots of tC in gC form a restricted root system of type Cn , where n =
dimR t is the (real) rank of N as a Jordan algebra (this result is essentially due
to C. Moore). We fix a basis {γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γn } of t∗ such that

                        Σ(tC , gC ) = {±(γi ± γj )/2, ±γj }.

    The restricted root system Σ = Σ(tC , kC ) is of type An−1 , Cn or Dn , and the
first of these cases arises precisely when N is a Euclidean Jordan algebra. This
case was studied in [S1], therefore we restrict our attention to the last two cases.
    The root multiplicities in Σ play a key role in our considerations. If Σ is Cn ,
there are two multiplicities, corresponding to the short and long roots, which
we denote by d and e, respectively. If Σ is Dn , and n 6= 2, then there is a single
multiplicity, which we denote by d, so that Dn may be regarded as a special
case of Cn , with e = 0.
    The root system D2 is reducible (being isomorphic to A1 × A1 ) and a priori
there are two root multiplicities. In what follows, we explicitly exclude the
case when these multiplicities are different. This means that we exclude from
consideration the groups

                       G = O(p, q), N = Rp−1,q−1 (p 6= q);

indeed, our main results are false for these groups. When the two multiplicities
coincide, we once again denote the common multiplicity  Pby d.
    The multiplicity of the short roots ±(γi ± γj )/2 in (tC , gC ) is equal to 2d,
and the multiplicity of the long roots ±γi is e + 1.
    In the appendix we include a table listing the groups under consideration,
as well as the values of d and e for each of these groups.

1.2    Cayley transform
We briefly review the notion of the Cayley transform. Let C be the following
element (of order 8) in SL2 (C)
                                             
                                   1    1 i
                             C= √               .
                                    2   i 1



                                         4
   The Cayley transform of sl2 (C) is the automorphism (of order 4) given by
                                      c = Ad C.
   It transforms the “usual” basis of sl2 (C)
                                                                      
                    0 1                0 0             1           0
              x=            , y=                , h=                           ,
                    0 0                1 0             0           −1
to the basis
                                                                              
            1        −i 1             1       i 1                      0   −1
         X=                     , Y =                      , H=i                       ,
            2        1 i              2       1 −i                     1   0
where X = c(x) = C −1 xC, etc. In turn, c can be expressed as
                             πi                  πi
                  c = exp ad    (x + y) = exp ad    (X + Y ).
                              4                   4
   The key property of the Cayley transform is that it takes the compact torus
(spanned by iH) to the split torus spanned by h (cf. [KW]).
   We turn now to the Lie algebra gC . By the Cartan-Helgason theorem the
root spaces pγj are one-dimensional, and so by the Jacobson-Morozov theorem
we get holomorphic homomorphisms
                          Φj : sl2 (C) −→ gC , j = 1, ..., n
such that Xj = Φj (X) spans pγj .
    We fix such maps Φj , and denote the images of x, X, y, Y, h, H by xj , Xj ,
etc. Since the roots γj are strongly orthogonal, the triples {Xj , Yj , Hj } commute
with each other, and the Cayley transform of g is defined to be the automorphism
                       πi X         X  Y                   πi
          c = exp ad            Xj +     Yj =      exp ad       (Xj + Yj ).
                        4                                    4
    Thus we obtain an R-split toral subalgebra a defined by
                         a = c−1 (it) = Rh1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Rhn .
The roots of aC in gC are
                                                        1
               Σ(aC , gC ) = {±εi ± εj , ±2εj } where εi =γi ◦ c.
                                                        2
The short roots have multiplicity 2d and the long roots have multiplicity e + 1.
   In fact a ⊂ l, and we have
 Σ(a, l) = {±(εi − εj )} , Σ(a, n) = {εi + εj , 2εj } , Σ(a, n) = {−εi − εj , −2εj }

Definition 1.1 The invariant form h., .i on g is normalized by requiring
                                     hx1 , y1 i = 1.

                         def   p
   For y ∈ n, we set |y| =      − hy, θyi , as in Introduction.

                                              5
1.3     Orbits and measures
We now describe the orbits of L in n ≃ N ∗ . For k = 1, ..., n − 1, define
                          Ok = L · (y1 + y2 + . . . + yk ).
Then these, together with the trivial orbit O0 , comprise the totality of the
singular (i.e., non-open) L-orbits in n.
    We define ν ∈ a∗ as
                             ν = ε1 + ε2 + . . . + εn .
Then ν extends to a character of l , and we will write eν for the corresponding
(spherical) character of L.
Lemma 1.1 The orbit O1 carries a natural L−equivariant measure dµ1 , which
transforms by the character e2dν , that is
                  Z                           Z
                                         2dν
                      g(l · y)dµ1 (y) = e (l)   g(y)dµ1 (y).
                    O1                             O1

Proof. Let S1 be the stabilizer of y1 in L. It suffices to show that the modular
function of S1 is the restriction, from L to S1 , of the character e2dν . Passing to
the Lie algebra s1 , we need to show that
                                 tr ads1 = 2dν|s1 .
    To see this, we remark that s1 has codimension 1 inside a maximal parabolic
subalgebra q of l, corresponding to the stabilizer of the line through y1 . The
space of characters of q is two-dimensional, and it follows that the space of
characters of s1 is one-dimensional. Hence any character of s1 is determined by
its restriction to a ∩ s1 = Ker ε1 . The restriction of ν to s1 is nontrivial, hence
                                    tr ads1 = kν
for some constant k.
    Obviously, tr adl = 0, and the only root spaces missing from s1 are the root
spaces lε1 −εj , j ≥ 2 (each of these root spaces has dimension 2d). Hence, for
a∈a
                                           n
                                           X
                         tr ads1 (a) = −2d   (ε1 − εj )(a),
                                             j=2

and restricting this to Ker ε1 , we obtain 2dν |a∩s1 .

2      Minimal representation of G
If χ is a character of l, we write πχ for the (unnormalized) induced representation
    G
IndP  (χ). These representations were studied in [S3] in the “compact” picture,
by algebraic methods. Among the results established there was the existence
of a finite number of “small”, unitarizable, spherical subrepresentations, which
occur for the following values of χ

                               χj = e−jdν , j = 1, . . . , n − 1.

   In this paper we use analytical methods, and work primarily with the “non-
compact” picture, which is the realization of πχ on C ∞ (N ), via the Gelfand-
Naimark decomposition

                                                G ≈ NP.

In fact, using the exponential map we can identify n and N , and realize πχ on
C ∞ (n).
    We will show that the unitarizable subrepresentation of πχ1 admits a natural
realization on the Hilbert space L2 (O1 , dµ). Since there is no obvious action of
G on this space, we have to proceed in an indirect fashion. The key is an explicit
realization of the spherical vector σχ1 .

2.1    The Bessel function
We let d, e be the root multiplicities of Σ(t, k) as in previous section, and define

                             τG = τ = (d − e − 1)/2

as in the introduction.
    Let Kτ be the K-Bessel function on (0, ∞) satisfying

                        z 2 Kτ′′ + zKτ′ − (z 2 + τ 2 )Kτ = 0.                   (1)
                   √
               Kτ ( z)
   Put φτ (z) = √ τ , then φτ satisfies the differential equation
                ( z)
                 Dφτ = 0, where Dφ = 4zφ′′ + 4(τ + 1)φ′ − φ.                    (2)
   We lift φτ to an M -invariant function gτ on O1 , by defining

                                                     Kτ (|y|)
                        gτ (y) = φτ (− hy, θyi) =         τ   .                 (3)
                                                      |y|
   Remark. If d = e (as is the case for G = Sp2n (C) or Spn,n ), then τ = − 21
and
                        1/2               1/2 exp(− |y|)
            gτ (y) = |y| K−1/2 (|y|) = |y|          1/2
                                                         = e−|y| .
                                                |y|
If d = e + 1 (this is true for GL2n (k), k = R, C or H), then

                                  gτ (y) = K0 (|y|).


Proposition 2.1 (1) gτ is a (square-integrable) function in L2 (O1 , dµ1 ).
  (2) The measure gτ dµ1 defines a tempered distribution on n.

Proof. (1) We define
                                def
                            O′ = {y ′ ∈ O1 : |y ′ | = 1}.

Then O′ is compact; the map

                       O′ × (0, ∞) ∋ (y ′ , w) 7−→ wy ′ ∈ O1

is a diffeomorphism, and the measure dµ1 can be decomposed as a product

                            dµ1 (wy ′ ) = dµ′ (y ′ )dµ′′ (w)

   We now determine the explicit form of dµ′′ (w).



                                           8
                P
   Define h = ni=1 hi , then (ad h)y = −2y for any y ∈ n. We take y ∈ O1 ,
z > 0, a = ln z and calculate
                       h                ah
 dµ1 (zy) = dµ1 (exp(−a ) · y) = e−2dν(− 2 ) dµ1 (y) = edna dµ1 (y) = z dn dµ1 (y).
                       2
Therefore, for z > 0
                               dµ1 (zy) = z dn dµ1 (y)                            (4)
and it follows that dµ′′ (zw) = z dn dµ′′ (w), and so, up to a scalar multiple,
                               dµ′′ (w) = wdn−1 dw,
where dw is the Lebesgue measure.
   We can now calculate
          Z                       Z         ∞   Z
                      2                                  Kτ (w)2 ′ ′ dn−1
              |gτ (y)| dµ1 (y) =                                dµ (y )w  dw
             O1                         0           O′    w2τ
                                        Z       ∞
                                                    Kτ (w)2 dn−1
                                  = c                      w     dw,              (5)
                                            0        w2τ
where c = µ′ (O′ ) is a positive constant. The function Kτ (w) has a pole of
order τ at 0 (or, in case of τ = 0, a logarithmic singularity at 0), and it decays
exponentially as w → ∞ [W, 3.71.15]. Hence w−2τ Kτ (w)2 has a pole of order
                       4τ = 2(d − e − 1) ≤ 2d − 2 < dn − 1
(recall that we require n ≥ 2). Thus the integrand in (5) is non-singular and
decays exponentially as w → ∞. Therefore, the integral (5) converges and
gτ (y) ∈ L2 (O1 , dµ1 ).
    (2) From the calculation in (1), we see that gτ (y) ∈ L1loc (O1 , dµ1 ) and has
exponential decay at ∞ (i.e., as |y| → ∞). This implies the result.
    We can now define the Fourier transform of gτ ,

                                    Φ = g\
                                         τ dµ1

as a (tempered) distribution on n. The key result is the following
Proposition 2.2 Φ is a multiple of the spherical vector σχ1 .
   The proof of this proposition will be given over the next two subsections.

2.2    Characterization of spherical vectors
For φ : n → n, let ξ(φ) denote the corresponding vector field:
                                              
                              d               
                 ξ(φ)f (x) =    f (x + tφ(x))     for f : n → C.
                             dt                 t=0

   Then we have the following formulas for the action of πχ on C ∞ (n):

                                            9
   • for x0 ∈ n, πχ (x0 ) = ξ(x0 ),
   • for h0 ∈ l, πχ (h0 ) = χ(h0 ) − ξ ([h0 , x]),
   • for y0 ∈ n, πχ (y0 ) = χ[x, y0 ] − 12 ξ ([h, x]), where h = [x, y0 ].

   We need a Lie algebra characterization of σχ :

Lemma 2.3 The space of πχ (k)-invariant distributions on n is 1–dimensional
(and spanned by σχ ).

Proof. It is well known (and easy to prove) that the only distributions on Rn ,
                            ∂
which are annihilated by ∂x     , i = 1, ..., n are the constants. More generally, we
                              i        n o
                                           ∂
can replace Rn by a manifold, and ∂x         i
                                                by any set of vector fields which span
the tangent space at each point of the manifold.
    For χ = 0, the formulas above show that π0 (g) acts by vector fields on
C ∞ (n). Moreover, using the decomposition G = KP , we see that π0 (k) is a
spanning family of vector fields. Thus the result follows in this case.
    For general χ, if T is a πχ (k)-invariant distribution, then T /σχ = T σ−χ is
π0 (k)-invariant, and hence a constant.

Proposition 2.4 Let T be an M -invariant distribution on n such that

                      πχ (y + θy)T = 0 for some y 6= 0 in n,

then T is a multiple of the spherical vector σχ .

Proof. The M -invariance of T implies that

                                      πχ (m)T = 0

Since m is a maximal subalgebra of k, m and y + θy generate k as a Lie algebra.
Thus
                                πχ (k)T = 0,
and the result follows from the previous lemma.

2.3    The K-invariance of the Bessel function
We now turn to the proof of Proposition 2.2. To simplify notation, we will write
π instead of πχ1 . Since Φ is clearly M -invariant, by Proposition 2.4 it suffices
to show
                                π(y1 + θy1 )Φ = 0
for y1 ∈ n. We will prove this through a sequence of lemmas.




                                           10
   It is convenient to introduce the following notation: if g1 and g2 are functions
on O1 , we define                  Z
                            (g1 , g2 ) =        g1 (y) g2 (y)dµ1 (y)
                                           O1

provided the integral converges.
   If g is a function on O1 and h ∈ l, then the action of h on g is given by

   In the computation below, we shall work with the expressions of the type

                         dt O1                    t=0

To justify differentiation under the integral sign, we need to impose the standard
conditions on g (e.g. [Ke, p.170]), as follows.
   Define a class of functions I ⊂ C ∞ (O1 ), given by the following conditions:
a smooth function g belongs to I if

   • g ∈ L1 (O1 , dµ1 ) and
   • for any h ∈ l we can find c > 0 and G(y) ∈ L1 (O1 , dµ1 ), such that

      for all y ∈ O1 and |t0 | < c.


Lemma 2.5 Suppose g1 , g2 are smooth functions on O1 , such that g1 g2 ∈ I.
Then
               (h · g1 , g2 ) + (g1 , h · g2 ) = 2dν(h)(g1 , g2 ).      (6)


Proof. Using the L-equivariance of dµ1 , we obtain
             Z                                       Z

Under the assumptions of the lemma, we can differentiate this identity in t, to
get              Z                             Z
                     h · (g1 g2 ) dµ1 = 2dν(h)   g1 g2 dµ1 .

By the Leibnitz rule, the result follows.

   More generally, if g1 , g2 are functions on n × O1 , then (g1 , g2 ) is a function
on n. In this notation, for g in L1 (O1 , dµ1 ), the Fourier transform of gdµ1 is
given by the formula
                                [1 = (e−ihx,yi , g).

Lemma 2.6 Let g ∈ L1 (O1 , dµ1 ) be a smooth function on O1 , such that

Suppose f = (e−ihx,yi , g), then

                π(y1 )f = − (e−ihx,yi , h · g(y)), where h = [x, y1 ].
                           2
Proof. By the formula for the action of π(y1 ), we get

        −2 (π(y1 )f + dν(h)f )      = ξ ([h, x]) · (e−ihx,yi , g)

where we have used the previous lemma, and the relation

  hx + t[h, x], yi = hx, yi + t h[h, x], yi = hx, yi − t hx, [h, y]i = hx, y − t[h, y]i .

The result follows.
    The pairing − h·, θ·i gives a positive definite M -invariant inner product on
n, and we now obtain the following

Lemma 2.7 Suppose that g(y) = φ (− hy, θyi) for some smooth φ on (0, ∞),
and e−ihx,yi g ∈ I. Put f (x) = (e−ihx,yi , g), as before. Then
                                                                      
                π(y1 )f = e−ihx,yi , hx, [[θy, y1 ], y]i φ′ (− hy, θyi) .

Proof. Writing h = [x, y1 ] as in the previous lemma, we get

                            d
            h · g(y) =         φ (− hy + t[h, y], θ(y + t[h, y])i)|t=0
                            dt
                            d                                          
                       =       φ − hy, θyi − 2t hθy, [h, y]i + O(t2 ) t=0
                            dt
                       =    −2 hθy, [h, y]i φ′ (− hy, θyi) .


                                            12
Since
                      hθy, [h, y]i = hθy, [[x, y1 ], y]i = hx, [[θy, y1 ], y]i ,
the result follows.
   The key lemma is the following computation

Lemma 2.8 Let φ and f be as in the previous lemma, and suppose for x ∈ n

                e−ihx,yi φ (− hy, θyi) ∈ I,               e−ihx,yi φ′ (− hy, θyi) ∈ I.             (7)

Then we have
                                                                        
              π(y1 + θy1 )f (x) = e−ihx,yi , i hθy1 , yi (Dφ) (− hy, θyi) ,                        (8)

where the differential operator D is given by the formula (2), i.e.

              (Dφ) (− hy, θyi) = 4 (− hy, θyi) φ′′ + 2(d + 1 − e)φ′ − φ.                           (9)



Proof. PChoose a basis lj of l and define functions cj (y) by the formula
[θy, y1 ] = j cj (y)lj . Then by the previous lemma
                 X                                                X d                          
                                                                                                 
 π(y1 )f    =             (e−ihx,yi , hx, [lj , y]i cj φ′ ) = i        e−ihx,y+t[lj ,y]i , cj φ′ 
                  j                                               j
                                                                    dt                            t=0
                   X
            =    i  (lj · e−ihx,yi , cj φ′ ).
                      j


Differentiation in this calculation is justified, because e−ihx,yi φ′ (− hy, θyi) ∈ I.
    Applying (6) to the last expression, we can write
                       X                                                      
         π(y1 )f = −i       e−ihx,yi , −2dν(lj )cj φ′ + cj lj · φ′ + φ′ lj · cj . (10)
                                j

We now calculate each term in this expression.

   • First we have                      X
                                                ν(lj )cj φ′ = ν([θy, y1 ])φ′ .
                                            j

        Since ν is a real character of l, it vanishes on l∩k and we have ν([θy, y1 ]) =
        ν([θy1 , y]). Recall that n and n are irreducible l-modules. Therefore,
        ν([θy1 , y]) = k hθy1 , yi for some constant k 6= 0, independent of y. Setting
        y = y1 , we get hθy1 , y1 i = h−x1 , y1 i = −1. Hence k = −ν([θy1 , y1 ]) = 1,
        and therefore             X
                               −      2dν(lj )cj φ′ = −2d hθy1 , yi φ′ .          (11)
                                        j



                                                       13
   • Next we compute
                                                         X
                                                              cj lj · φ′ = [θy, y1 ] · φ′
                                                          j
                  d ′
                =    φ (− hy + t[[θy, y1 ], y], θ(y + t[[θy, y1 ], y])i)|t=0
                  dt
                                 = −2 hy, [[y, θy1 ], θy]i φ′′ (− hy, θyi)

      Since y is a k-conjugate to a root vector, there is a scalar k ′ independent of
      y such that [[y, θy], y] = k ′ hy, θyi y . Setting y = y1 we get hy1 , θy1 i = −1,

                                             [[y1 , −x1 ], y1 ] = −2y1

      and k ′ = 2. Also − hy, [[y, θy1 ], θy]i = h[y, θy], [y, θy1 ]i = h[[y, θy], y], θy1 i.
      Hence                X
                                cj lj · φ′ = 4 hy, θyi hθy1 , yi φ′′ .                  (12)
                                  j
                                P
   • Next we note that                j lj   · cj is independent of the basis lj , so we may
     assume that
                                  θlj = ±lj and hlj , −θlk i = δjk .
      Then cj (y) = h[θy, y1 ], −θlj i and
                          P               P
                             j l j · cj =  j h[θ[lj , y], y1 ], −θlj i
                        P
                      = j hy1 , [θ[lj , y], θlj ]i = − hy1 , Ωθyi .
                 P           2
      Here Ω =     j ad(θlj ) = Ωl − 2Ωk∩l , where the Casimir elements are
      obtained by using dual bases with respect to h , i.
      To continue, we need the following lemma:


Lemma 2.9 Ω acts on n by the scalar k ′′ = 2 − 2e.

Proof. When e = 1 it’s easy to see that the operator Ω acts by 0. Indeed,
in this case g is a complex semisimple Lie algebra
                                               √        and for each basis element
lj ∈ k ∩ l there exists a basis element lj′ = −1lj ∈ p ∩ l . Then [lj , [lj , x]] +
[lj′ , [lj′ , x]] = 0 and k ′′ = 0.
       When e = 0, g is split and simply laced, and l is the split real form of a
complex reductive algebra lC . Take a root vector xλ ∈ gλ , where λ is any positive
root in n. For any positive root α of lC we fix eα ∈ lα and set lα = eα +θeα ∈ k∩l
and lα′ = eα − θeα ∈ p ∩ l. Then the collection of all lα , lα′ together with the
orthonormal basis of a Cartan subalgebra f of l forms a basis of l. Observe that

         [lα , [lα , xλ ]] + [lα′ , [lα′ , xλ ]] = [eα , [eα , xλ ]] + [e−α , [e−α , xλ ]] = 0,


                                                    14
since xλ ∈ gλ and neither λ + 2α nor λ − 2α is a root of the simply laced algebra
gC .
     We choose a basis {ui } of f, and denote the elements of the dual (with respect
to h , i) basis by u
                   ei . Then
                             X
                     Ωxλ =        [ui , [e
                                         ui , xλ ]] = hλ, λi xλ = 2xλ .
                              i

     In the remaining two cases k ∩ l acts on n irreducibly,
                                                      P           therefore Ω automat-
ically acts by a scalar and it suffices to compute j [lj , [lj , x1 ]]. For e = 3 we
have G = GL2n (H), L = GLn (H) × GLn (H) and n = Hn×n . The computation
for this group is similar to the case of G = GL2n (R). We reduce the calculation
to the summation over the diagonal subalgebra of l and obtain
                                        
√     √      
                  Ωxλ = hλ, λi xλ + 3 −1λ, −1λ xλ = −4xλ .
                                                                    P
     Finally, for e = 2 (G = Spn,n ), a direct evaluation of j [lj , [lj , x1 ]] gives
k ′′ = −2.
Therefore, we get       X
                            φ′ lj · cj = −2(1 − e) hθy1 , yi φ′ .                 (13)
                         j

   • Finally, we have
                      d  −ihx+tθy1 ,yi                               
         π(θy1 )f =      e             ,φ     = −i e−ihx,yi , hθy1 , yi φ .     (14)
                      dt                   t=0




    Putting the formulas (11)–(14) together, we deduce the lemma.
                                                                  √
                                                              Kτ ( z)
    Proof of Proposition 2.2. Recall that we study φτ (z) = √ τ , its lift
                                                               ( z)
gτ to the radial function on O1 ,
                                                     Kτ (|y|)
                         gτ (y) = φτ (− hy, θyi) =        τ
                                                      |y|

and its Fourier transform Φ(x) = (e−ihx,yi , gτ ). By Proposition 2.4 it suffices
to check that π(y1 + θy1 )Φ = 0. This identity would follow immediately from
Lemma 2.8, because Dφτ = 0 by formula (2) and then the desired result follows
from (8).
    To complete the proof we have to verify the assumptions (7). In subsection
2.1 we proved that gτ ∈ L1 (O1 , dµ1 ). It is easy to verify (using the standard facts
about the derivatives of Kτ from [W]), that the lifts to O1 of the functions φ′τ (z)
and φ′′τ (z) (we denote them by gτ′ (y) and gτ′′ (y)) both belong to L1 (O1 , dµ1 ).
Observe also that φτ (z), φ′τ (z), φ′′τ (z) are all monotone on (0, ∞).

                                         15
     Moreover, since all these functions tend to zero exponentially as |y| → ∞,
the functions A(y)gτ (y), A(y)gτ′ (y), A(y)gτ′′ (y) all belong to L1 (O1 , dµ1 ), for
any A(y) bounded in the neighbourhood of y = 0 and growing (at most) poly-
nomially with respect to |y| as |y| → ∞.
     Fix h ∈ l , x ∈ n and choose c > 0 sufficiently small, such that for all y ∈ O1
and |t| < c
                             
 th                 
                              e · y, θ(eth · y)  ≥ |hy, θyi| .
                                                           2
We can then estimate the derivative:

d

for all y ∈ O1 and |t| < c, where A1 (y), A2 (y) are some functions of polynomial
growth. From the discussion above, the right-hand side of this inequality is an
L1 -function on O1 , hence e−ihx,yi gτ ∈ I.
    Proceeding in the same manner, we deduce that e−ihx,yi gτ′ ∈ I.


2.4     Proof of Theorem 0.1
Denote by J the space of the induced representation π1 = IndG
                                                            P (e
                                                                 −dν
                                                                     ). By
the Gelfand-Naimark decomposition and the exp map, J can be viewed as a
subspace of C ∞ (n). Then for l ∈ L and η ∈ J we have

                            π1 (l)η(x) = e−dν (l)η(l−1 · x).

It was proved in [S3] that the (g, K)-module J has a unitarizable spherical
(g, K)-submodule V , which we also regard as a subspace of C ∞ (n).
    Remark. It is possible to give a direct description of the elements of the
“abstract” Hilbert space H, where H is the Hilbert space closure of V with re-
spect to the (g, K)-invariant norm on V . For that purpose we use the “compact”
realization of π1 on C ∞ (K/M ) from [S3]. It was shown that π1 is a represen-
tation of ladder type, with all its K-types {αm | m ∈ N} lying on a single line,
α1 being a one-dimensional K-type. The restriction h , im of a π1 -invariant
Hermitian form to any K-type αm is a multiple of the L2 (K)-inner product on
V , and from the explicit formulas in [S3] it follows that

                                    def   h , im
                                qm =             = O(mC )
                                          h , i1
for some constant C > 1, which can be expressed in terms of parameters d, e
and n. Thus we can identify H with the Hilbert space L2 (N, {qm }), where the
constant qm gives the weight of the point m ∈ N. That is, any element of H can
be viewed as an M -equivariant function on K, such that its sequence of Fourier
coefficients belongs to L2 (N, {qm }). In particular L2 (N, {qm }) ⊂ l2 (N), and the
elements of H all lie in L2 (K).

                                             16
   We write H for the space of those tempered distributions on n which are
Fourier transforms of ψdµ1 for some ψ ∈ L2 (O1 , dµ1 ). If η is the Fourier trans-
form of a distribution of the form ψdµ1 , i.e.,
                      Z                                         

                    = (e            , edν (l)ψ(l−1 · y)).

It follows from the calculation above that P acts unitarily on H (it is convenient
to identify this action with its realization on L2 (O1 , dµ1 ) via the Fourier trans-
form).We denote this unitary representation of P by π ′ . Observe that (π ′ , H)
is an irreducible representation of P .
                                                             −τ
    According to Proposition 2.1, Φ(x) = (e−i<x,y> , |y| Kτ (|y|)) belongs to
H.

Theorem 2.10 V is a dense subspace of H, and the restriction of the norm is
(g, K)-invariant.

Proof. Let C ∞ (K)V be the subspace of C ∞ (K), consisting of those smooth
functions on K, whose K-isotypic components belong to V . Since V is a sub-
module of J, C ∞ (K)V is obviously G-invariant.
   Denote by C(G) the convolution algebra of smooth L1 functions on G = P K,
and consider
                        W = π1 (C(G))Φ ⊂ C ∞ (K)V .
So all elements of W are continuous functions on K, hence continuous on
G, and therefore are determined by their restrictions to N . Moreover, W =
π1 (C(P K))Φ and K fixes Φ, therefore

                           W = π1 (C(P ))Φ = π ′ (C(P ))Φ.

This shows that W is a π ′ (P )-invariant subspace of H, and from the irreducibil-
ity of π ′ we conclude that W is dense in H.
    We can now put two π1 (PP )-invariant norms on W – one from H and another
from V , as follows. If f = cm vm , with vm in the K-isotypic component with
highest weight αm (occurring in V ) and kvm kL2 (K) = 1, then

                                          2
                                                 X            2
                                    kf kV =              |cm | qm .                                      (15)


                                                    17
Since f is smooth, it follows that |cm | decays rapidly, so the series in (15)
converges, thus giving a π1 (P )-invariant norm on W.
   Then it follows from [P] (cf. [S1, p.417]), that we can find a (dense) C(P )-
invariant subspace W′ ⊂ W, such that these two forms are proportional on W′ .
Considering the closure of W′ we obtain an isometric P -invariant imbedding of
H into H.
   Then W is:
   (1) a G-invariant subspace of the irreducible module H, hence dense in H;
   (2) a dense subspace of the Hilbert space H.
   It follows that H = H.
    This concludes the proof of Theorem 0.1.


3     Tensor powers of π1
3.1    Restrictions to P
In the previous section we constructed a unitary representation π1 of G acting
on the Hilbert space L2 (O1 , dµ1 ), where O1 is the minimal L-orbit in a non-
Euclidean Jordan algebra N . Define the k-th tensor power representation

                               Πk = π1⊗k (2 ≤ k < n).

As we shall show, the techniques developed in [DS] allow us to establish a du-
ality between the spectrum of this tensor power and the spectrum of a certain
homogeneous space. We omit the proofs of the several propositions below, be-
cause the proofs of the corresponding statements from [DS] can be used without
any substantial modification.
    Observe that the orbit Ok is dense in O1 + O1 + . . . + O1 . The representa-
                                              |         {z       }

tion Πk acts on L (O1 , dµ1 )     ≃ L2 (Ok′ , dµ′ ), where Ok′ = O1×k and dµ′ is the
                        ′
product measure on Ok . We fix a generic representative ξ ′ = (ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξk ) ∈
Ok′ , such that
                           ξ = ξ1 + ξ2 + . . . + ξk ∈ Ok .
   Denote by Sk′ and Sk the isotropy subgroups of ξ ′ and ξ, respectively, with
respect to the action of L on Ok′ and Ok . Observe that the Lie algebras s′k and
sk of Sk′ and Sk , respectively, can be written as

                              s′k   =   (hk + lk ) + uk
                              sk    =   (gk + lk ) + uk .

Here lk , gk and hk are reductive, hk ⊂ gk and uk is a nilpotent radical common
for both s′k and sk . Let Gk and Hk be the corresponding Lie groups.



                                          18
   Example. Take G = O2n,2n and k < n. Then ξi = E2i−1,2i − E2i,2i−1
                Pk
(1 ≤ i ≤ k), ξ = i=1 ξi and
                                              
                  sk = sp2k (R) + gl2(n−k) (R) + R2k,2(n−k) .

Then Gk = Sp2k (R) and it’s easy to check that Hk = SL2 (R)k .
    The following Lemma can be verified by direct calculation (cf. [DS, Lemma
2.1]).

Lemma 3.1 Let χξ be the character of N corresponding to ξ ∈ N ∗ . Then
                                                       
   Πk |P = IndP                    P        Sk
              Sk′ N (1 ⊗ χξ ) = IndSk N (IndS ′ 1) ⊗ χξ   (L2 -induction).
                                                 k



   Let γ ′ = IndG                                                  2
                 Hk 1 be the quasiregular representation of Gk on L (Gk /Hk );
                   k


then it can be decomposed using the Plancerel measure dµ for the reductive
homogeneous space Xk = Gk /Hk and the corresponding multiplicity function
m:G bk → {0, 1, 2, . . .}, i.e.,
                                   Z   ⊕
                              ′
                            γ ≃            m(κ)κ dµ(κ).
                                   bk
                                   G

Each irreducible representation κ of Gk can be extended to an irreducible repre-
sentation κ∨ of Sk , and the decomposition of the Lemma above can be rewritten
as                                Z    ⊕
                         Πk |P =           m(κ)Θ(κ) dµ(κ),                   (16)
                                   bk
                                   G

where Θ(κ) = IndP        ∨
                  Sk N (κ ⊗ χξ ).
   Moreover, by Mackey theory all representations Θ(κ) are unitary irreducible
                                       ′′
representations of P , and Θ(κ′ ) ≃ Θ(κ ) if and only if κ′ ≃ κ′′ .

3.2    Low-rank theory
In [DS] we extended the theory of low-rank representations ([Li]) to the confor-
mal groups of euclidean Jordan algebras. Inspection of the argument in [DS]
shows that the analogous theory can be developed in exactly the same manner
for the conformal groups of non-euclidean Jordan algebras.
    For any unitary representation η of G, we decompose its restriction η|N into
a direct integral of unitary characters, where the decomposition is determined
by a projection-valued measure on N  b = N ∗ . If this measure is supported on
a single non-open L-orbit Om , 1 ≤ m < n we call η a low-rank representation,
and write rank η = m. Proceeding by induction on m, as in [Li], [DS, Sect 3],
we can prove the following



                                           19
Theorem 3.2 Let η be a low-rank representation of G. Write A(η, P ) for the
von Neumann algebra generated by {η(x)| x ∈ P } and A(η, G) for the von Neu-
mann algebra generated by {η(x)| x ∈ G}. Then A(η, G) = A(η, P ).

    Proof of Theorem 0.2. Now consider the restriction of Πk to N . Its
restriction to P is given by the direct integral decomposition (16), and we
can further restrict it to N . The rank of the induced representation Θ(κ) =
IndP       ∨
    Sk N (κ ⊗ χξ ) is k (the N –spectrum is supported on the L−orbit of ξ, i.e.
Ok ). Therefore Πk can be decomposed over the irreducible representations of
G of rank k.
    It follows from the theorem above that any two non-isomorphic representa-
tions from the spectrum of Πk restrict to non-isomorphic irreducible represen-
tations of P . Hence the representation Πk can be decomposed as
                                 Z ⊕
                            Πk =     m(κ)θ(κ) dµ(κ),                      (17)
                                    bk
                                    G

where for almost every κ the unitary irreducible representation θ(κ) is ob-
tained as the unique irreducible representation of G determined by the condition
θ(κ)|P = Θ(κ).
    Therefore, the map κ → θ(κ) gives a (measurable) bijection between the
spectrum of Πk = π ⊗k and the unitary representations of Gk occurring in the
quasiregular representation on L2 (Gk /Hk ).
    Example. Take G = E7(7) . It is the conformal group of the split exceptional
real Jordan algebra N of dimension 27. Consider the tensor square of the mini-
mal representation π1 of G (k = 2). Then L = R∗ × E6(6) , S2′ is the stabilizer of
y1 and y2 and S2 is the stabilizer of y1 + y2 ∈ O2 . One can see that in this case
g2 = Stabs0(5,5) (y1 + y2 ) = so(4, 5) and h2 = Stabs0(5,5) (y1 ) ∩ Stabs0(5,5) (y2 ) =
so(4, 4) (cf. [A, 16.7]). Hence the decomposition (17) establishes a duality
between the representations of E7(7) occurring in Π2 = π1 ⊗ π1 and the uni-
tary representations of Spin(4, 5) occurring in L2 (Spin(4, 5)/Spin(4, 4)) . The
homogeneous space Spin(4, 5)/Spin(4, 4) is a (pseudo-riemannian) symmetric
space of rank 1, and it is known to be multiplicity free. Therefore, π1 ⊗ π1 has
simple spectrum.
    Similarly, for G = E7 (C) we obtain a duality between E7 (C) and the sym-
metric space SO9 (C)/SO8 (C).
