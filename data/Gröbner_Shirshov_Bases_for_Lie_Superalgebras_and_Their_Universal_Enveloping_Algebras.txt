1     Introduction
Let A be a free (commutative, associative, or Lie) algebra over a field k, let S ⊂ A be a
set of relations in A, and let hSi be the ideal of A generated by S. One of the fundamental
problems in the theory of abstract algebras is the reduction problem: given an element
f ∈ A, one would like to find a reduced expression for f with respect to the relations in S.
One of the most common approaches to this problem is to find another set of generators
for the relations in S that can replace the original relations so that one can get an effective
algorithm for the reduction problem. More precisely, if one can find a set S c of generators
of the ideal hSi which is closed under a certain composition of relations in S, then there
exists an easy criterion by which one can determine whether an element f ∈ A is reduced
with respect to S or not.
    In 1965, inspired by Gröbner’s suggestion, Buchberger found a criterion and an algo-
rithm of computing such a set of generators of the ideals for commutative algebras [16],
which were modified and refined in [17] and [18]. Such a set of generators of ideals is now
referred to as a Gröbner basis, and it has become one of the most popular research topics
in the theory of commutative algebras (see for example, [3]). In 1978, Bergman developed
the theory of Gröbner bases for associative algebras by proving the Diamond Lemma [4].
His idea is a generalization of Buchberger’s theory and it has many applications to various
areas of the theory of associative algebras such as quantum groups.
    For the case of Lie algebras, where the situation is more complicated than commutative
or associative algebras, the parallel theory of Gröbner basis was developed by Shirshov
in 1962 [30], which is even earlier than Buchberger’s discovery. In that paper, which
was written in Russian and never translated in English, he introduced the notion of
composition of elements of a free Lie algebra and showed that a set of relations which is
closed under the composition has the desired property. Shirshov’s idea is essentially the
same as that of Buchberger, and it was noticed by Bokut that Shirshov’s method works
for associative algebras as well [7]. For this reason, we will call such a set of relations
of a free Lie algebra (and of a free associative algebra) a Gröbner-Shirshov basis. (See
[2] for a more detailed history of Gröbner-Shirshov basis.) It has been used to determine
the solvability of some word problems [29, 30, 6] and to prove some embedding theorems
[5, 7, 8]. Recently, in a series of works by Bokut, Klein, and Malcolmson, Gröbner-Shirshov
bases for finite dimensional simple Lie algebras and the quantized enveloping algebra of
type An were constructed explicitly ([9, 10, 11, 14]).
    In this work, we develop the theory of Gröbner-Shirshov bases for Lie superalgebras
and their universal enveloping algebras. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,


                                              2
after introducing the basic facts such as super-Lyndon-Shirshov words (monomials) and
Composition Lemma, we prove that a set of monic polynomials in the free Lie superalgebra
is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for a Lie superalgebra if and only if it is a Gröbner-Shirshov
basis for its universal enveloping algebra (Theorem 2.8). This is a generalization of the cor-
responding result for Lie algebras obtained in [15]. Thus the theory of Gröbner-Shirshov
bases for Lie superalgebras and that of associative algebras are unified in this way, and
as a by-product, we obtain a purely combinatorial proof of the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt
Theorem (Proposition 2.11).
    In section 3, we investigate the structure of Gröbner-Shirshov bases for Kac-Moody
superalgebras and prove that, in order to find a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for a Kac-Moody
superalgebra, it suffices to consider the completion of Serre relations of the positive part
(or negative part) which is closed under the composition (Theorem 3.5). As a corollary,
we obtain the triangular decomposition of Kac-Moody superalgebras and their universal
enveloping algebras (Corollary 3.6). Our result in this section is a generalization of the
corresponding result for Kac-Moody algebras obtained in [14].
    Finally, in Section 4, we give an explicit construction of Gröbner-Shirshov bases for
classical Lie superalgebras. The outline of our construction can be described as follows.
We first start with a Kac-Moody superalgebra which is isomorphic to a given classical
Lie superalgebra. Using the supersymmetry and Jacobi identity, we expand the set of
Serre relations to a complete set R of relations which is closed under the composition
and determine the set B of R-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials. Now compar-
ing the number of elements of B with the dimension of the corresponding classical Lie
superalgebra, we conclude that the set R is indeed a Gröbner-Shirshov basis.
    The main part of this work was completed while the first and the second authors were
visiting Korea Institute for Advanced Study in the winter of 1998. We would like to
express our sincere gratitude to Hyo-Chul Myung, Efim Zelmanov and the other members
of Korea Institute for Advanced Study for their hospitality and cooperation.



2     Gröbner-Shirshov bases for Lie superalgebras
Let X = X0̄ ∪ X1̄ be a Z2 -graded set with a linear ordering ≺, and let X ∗ (resp. X # ) be
the semigroup of associative words on X (resp. the groupoid of nonassociative words on
X). Then the semigroup X ∗ (resp. the groupoid X # ) has the Z2 -grading X ∗ = X0̄∗ ⊕ X1̄∗
(resp. X # = X0̄# ⊕ X1̄# ) induced by that of X. The elements of X0̄∗ and X0̄# (resp. X1̄∗
and X1̄# ) are called even (resp. odd).


                                              3
    We denote by l(u) the length of a word u and the empty word will be denoted by 1. For
an associative word u ∈ X ∗ , we can choose a certain arrangement of brackets on u, which
will be denoted by (u). Conversely, there is a canonical bracket removing homomorphism
ρ : X # → X ∗ given by ρ((u)) = u for u ∈ X ∗ .
    We consider two linear orderings < and ≪ on X ∗ defined as follows:

     (i) u < 1 for any nonempty word u; and inductively, u < v whenever u = xi u′ ,
     v = xj v ′ and xi ≺ xj or xi = xj and u′ < v ′ .
     (ii) u ≪ v if l(u) < l(v) or l(u) = l(v) and u < v.

The ordering < (resp. ≪) is called the lexicographical ordering (resp. length-lexicographical
ordering). We define the orderings < and ≪ on X # by (i) u < v if and only if ρ(u) < ρ(v),
and (ii) u ≪ v if and only if ρ(u) ≪ ρ(v).
   A nonempty word u is called a Lyndon-Shirshov word if u ∈ X or vw > wv for
any decomposition of u = vw with v, w ∈ X ∗ . A nonempty word u is called a super-
Lyndon-Shirshov word if either it is a Lyndon-Shirshov word or it has the form u = vv
with v a Lyndon-Shirshov word in X1̄∗ . A nonempty nonassociative word u is called a
Lyndon-Shirshov monomial if either u is an element of X or

     (i) if u = u1 u2 , then u1 , u2 are Lyndon-Shirshov monomials with u1 > u2 ,
     (ii) if u = (v1 v2 )w then v2 ≤ w.

A nonempty nonassociative word u is called a super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomial if either
it is a Lyndon-Shirshov monomial or it has the form u = vv with v a Lyndon-Shirshov
monomial in X1̄# .
Remark. In some literatures, the Lyndon-Shirshov words have been referred to as regular
words, normal words, Lyndon words, etc. Since the definition of Lyndon-Shirshov words
dates back to the works by Chen, Fox and Lyndon [19] and Shirshov [27], we decide to
call them Lyndon-Shirshov words. The definition of super-Lyndon-Shirshov words can be
found in [1, 24].

    The following lemma asserts that there is a natural 1-1 correspondence between the
set of super-Lyndon-Shirshov words and the set of super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials.

Lemma 2.1 ([1, 19, 24, 26]) If u is a super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomial, then ρ(u) is a
super-Lyndon-Shirshov word. Conversely, for any super-Lyndon-Shirshov word u, there
is a unique arrangement of brackets [u] on u such that [u] is a super-Lyndon-Shirshov
monomial.

                                             4
   Let k be a field with char(k) 6= 2, 3, and let AX be the free associative algebra generated
by X over k. The algebra AX becomes a Lie superalgebra with the superbracket defined
by
                               [x, y] = xy − (−1)(deg x)(deg y) yx
for x, y ∈ AX . Let LX be the subalgebra of AX generated by X as a Lie superalgebra.
Then LX is the free Lie superalgebra generated by X over k. As we can see in the following
theorem, there is a canonical linear basis for the free Lie superalgebra LX :

Theorem 2.2 ([1, 19, 24, 26]) The set of super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials form a linear
basis of the free Lie superalgebra LX generated by X.

Remark. The existence of linear bases for free Lie algebras of this form was first suggested
by Hall [22], and later by Shirshov in a more general form ([26, 28]). The linear basis
for a free Lie superalgebra given in the above theorem will be called the Lyndon-Shirshov
basis. It is a special case of the Hall-Shirshov basis.

    Given a nonzero element p ∈ AX we denote by p the maximal monomial appearing
                                             P
in p under the ordering ≪. Thus p = αp + βi wi with α, βi ∈ k, wi ∈ X ∗ , α 6= 0 and
wi ≪ p. The coefficient α of p is called the leading coefficient of p and p is said to be
monic if α = 1.
    The following lemma plays a crucial role in defining the notion of Lie composition.

Lemma 2.3 ([19, 24, 26]) Let u and v be super-Lyndon-Shirshov words such that v is
contained in u as a subword. Write u = avb with a, b ∈ X ∗ . Then there is an arrangement
of brackets [u] = (a[v]b) on u such that [v] is a super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomial, [u] = u
and the leading coefficient of [u] is either 1 or 2.

    Let u = avb be a super-Lyndon-Shirshov word, where v is a super-Lyndon-Shirshov
subword and a, b ∈ X ∗ . We define the bracket on u relative to v, denoted by [u]v , as
follows:

     (i) [u]v = (a[v]b) if the leading coefficient of [u] is 1,
     (ii) [u]v = 12 (a[v]b) if the leading coefficient of [u] is 2,

where the arrangement of brackets [u] on u is the one described in Lemma 2.3. Note that
[u]v is monic and [u]v = u.
    Similarly, if p is a monic polynomial in the free Lie superalgebra LX such that p is
super-Lyndon-Shirshov, then we define the bracket on u relative to p, denoted by [u]p

                                                5
to be the result of the substitution of p instead of p in [u]p . Clearly, [u]p is monic and
[u]p = u.
    We now define the notion of associative composition of the elements in the free asso-
ciative algebra AX generated by X. Let p, q be monic elements in AX with leading terms
p and q. If there exist a, b ∈ X ∗ such that pa = bq = w with l(p) > l(b), then we define
the composition of intersection (p, q)w to be

(2.1)                                    (p, q)w = pa − bq.

If there exist a, b ∈ X ∗ such that p = aqb = w, then we define the composition of inclusion
to be

(2.2)                                    (p, q)w = p − aqb.

Note that we have (p, q)w ≪ w in either case.
   Next we proceed to define the notion of Lie composition of the elements in the free
Lie superalgebra LX generated by X. Let p, q be monic polynomials in the free Lie
superalgebra LX with leading terms p and q. If there exist a, b ∈ X ∗ such that pa = bq = w
with l(p) > l(b), then we define the composition of intersection hf, giw to be

(2.3)                                  hf, giw = [w]p − [w]q .

If there exist a, b ∈ X ∗ such that p = aqb = w, then we define the composition of inclusion
to be

(2.4)                                    hp, qiw = p − [w]q .

We have hp, qiw ≪ w in this case, too.

Remark. Our definition of Lie composition is essentially the same as the one given in
[6, 23, 24, 29]. We modified the definition in [6, 23, 24, 29] to define the Lie composition
hp, qiw at one stroke.

   Let S be a set of monic polynomials in LX ⊂ AX , let I be the (Lie) ideal generated by
S in the free Lie superalgebra LX , and let J be the (associative) ideal generated by S in
the free associative algebra AX . We denote by L = LX /I the Lie superalgebra generated
by X with defining relations S and let U(L) = AX /J be its universal enveloping algebra.
                                                                                  P
   For f, g ∈ AX and w ∈ X ∗ , we write f ≡A g mod (S, w) if f − g =                αi ai si bi , where
αi ∈ k, ai , bi ∈ X ∗ , si ∈ S with ai si bi ≪ w for each i. Similarly, for f, g ∈ LX and w ∈ X ∗ ,

                                                  6
                                          P
we write f ≡L g mod (S, w) if f −g = αi (ai (si )bi ), where αi ∈ k, ai , bi ∈ X ∗ , si ∈ S with
p(ai (si )bi ) ≪ w for each i. The set S is said to be closed under the associative composition
(resp. Lie composition) if for any f, g ∈ S, we have (f, g)w ≡A 0 (resp. hf, giw ≡L 0)
mod (S, w).
    A set of monic polynomials S in the free Lie superalgebra LX is called a Gröbner-
Shirshov basis for the ideal J (resp. for the ideal I) if it is closed under the associative
composition (resp. Lie composition). By abuse of language, we will also refer to S as a
Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the associative algebra U(L) and for the Lie superalgebra L,
respectively. An associative word u is said to be S-reduced if u 6= asb for any s ∈ S and
a, b ∈ X ∗ . A nonassociative word u is said to be S-reduced if ρ(u) is S-reduced.
    The following lemma is a generalization of Lemma 1 in [9].

Lemma 2.4
    (a) Every nonempty word u in the free associative algebra AX can be written as
                                 X           X
(2.5)                        u=      αi ui +    βj aj sj bj ,

where ui is an S-reduced word, αi , βj ∈ k, aj , bj ∈ X ∗ , sj ∈ S and aj sj bj ≪ u for all i, j.
Hence the set of S-reduced words spans the algebra U(L).
    (b) Every super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomial u in LX can be written as
                                X             X
(2.6)                       u=        αi ui +      βj (aj (sj )bj ),

where ui is an S-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomial, αi , βj ∈ k, aj , bj ∈ X ∗ , sj ∈ S
and (aj (sj )bj ) ≪ u for all i, j. Hence the set of S-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov mono-
mials spans the Lie superalgebra L.

Proof. Since the proof of (a) is similar to that of (b), we only give a proof of (b). If u is
S-reduced, we are done. Thus we assume that u = asb for some s ∈ S, a, b ∈ X ∗ . Then u
and s are super-Lyndon-Shirshov words and u − α[u]s ≪ u for some α ∈ k. Since u−α[u]s
is a linear combination of super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials whose leading terms are less
than u, we may proceed by induction, which completes the proof. 



    The following lemma plays a crucial role in our discussion of Gröbner-Shirshov bases.
It is originally due to Shirshov [30] and is now known as the Composition Lemma.

Lemma 2.5 (cf. [1, 6, 24, 30]) If S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the ideal J, then for
any f ∈ J, the word f contains a subword s with s ∈ S.

                                               7
   It is clear that if a polynomial f ∈ LX satisfies f ≡L 0 mod(S, w) for w ∈ X ∗ ,
then f ≡A 0 mod(S, w). The converse is also true if S is closed under the associative
composition.

Lemma 2.6 Assume that S is closed under the associative composition. If a polynomial
f ∈ LX satisfies f ≡A 0 mod(S, w) for w ∈ X ∗ , then f ≡L 0 mod(S, w).

Proof. Suppose f ≡A 0 mod(S, w) for w ∈ X ∗ and our assertion holds for all w ′ ≪ w.
Then f ∈ J, and by the Composition Lemma, f = asb for some a, b ∈ X ∗ and s ∈ S.
Since f − [f ]s ≡A 0 mod(S, f) and f ≪ w, our assertion follows by induction. 




Lemma 2.7 Let f, g ∈ S be monic polynomials in LX such that the associative composi-
tion (f, g)w is defined. Then we have

(2.7)                      (f, g)w ≡A hf, giw     mod (S, w).

Proof.     We consider the composition of intersection only. The proof for the compo-
                                                          P
sition of inclusion is similar. Recall that [w]f = f a +    αi ai f bi with ai fbi ≪ w and
            P
[w]g = bg+ βi ci gdi with ci gdi ≪ w. Thus hf, giw = [w]f −[w]g = f a−bg+h = (f, g)w +h,
where h ≡A 0 mod(S, w). Hence (f, g)w ≡A hf, giw mod(S, w). 



   Combining Lemma 2.6 and Lemma 2.7, we obtain the main result of this section,
which is a generalization of the main theorem in [15].

Theorem 2.8 Let S be a set of monic polynomials in the free Lie superalgebra LX . Then
                                                                 
S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the Lie superalgebra L = LX I if and only if S is
                                                                          
a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for its universal enveloping algebra U(L) = AX J. That is,
S is closed under the Lie composition if and only if it is closed under the associative
composition.

   The following proposition, which is a generalization of Proposition 2 in [9], provides
us with a criterion for determining whether a set of monic polynomials in the free Lie
superalgebra is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis or not.




                                            8
Proposition 2.9
                                                                       
   (a) If the set of S-reduced words is a linear basis of U(L) = AX J, then S is a
Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the ideal J of AX .
   (b) If the set of S-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials is a linear basis of L =
   
LX I, then S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the ideal I of LX .

Proof. Since the proof of (b) is the same as (a), we will prove (a) only. Suppose on the
contrary that S is not closed under the associative composition. Then there exist f, g ∈ S
such that (f, g)w 6≡A 0 mod(S, w) for w ∈ X ∗ . By Lemma 2.4, we may write
                                       X          X
                             (f, g)w =    αi ui +     βj aj sj bj ,

where αi , βj ∈ k, ui is S-reduced, aj , bj ∈ X ∗ , sj ∈ S and aj sj bj ≪ w for all i and j. Since
                                     P
(f, g)w 6≡A 0 mod(S, w), we have          αi ui 6= 0 in AX . Since the set of S-reduced words
                                     P
is a linear basis of U(L), we have         αi ui 6= 0 in U(L). But, since (f, g)w ∈ J, we have
P
   αi ui = 0 in U(L), which is a contradiction. 



   Conversely, by Lemma 2.4 and the Composition Lemma, we can show that a Gröbner-
Shirshov basis gives rise to a linear basis for the corresponding algebras.

Theorem 2.10
    (a) If S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the Lie superalgebra L = LX /I, then the set
of S-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials forms a linear basis of L.
    (b) If S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the universal enveloping algebra U(L) = AX /J
of L, then the set of S-reduced words forms a linear basis of U(L).

Proof. Since the proof of (b) is similar to that of (a), we will prove (a) only. By Lemma
2.4 the set of S-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials spans L. Assume that we
      P
have     αi ui = 0 in L, where αi ∈ k and ui are distinct S-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov
                     P
monomials. Then         αi ui ∈ I in the free Lie super algebra LX . Since I ⊂ J, we obtain
P                                                                           P
   αi ui ∈ J. By the Composition Lemma (Lemma 2.5) the leading term            αi ui contains
a subword s with s ∈ S. Since each ui is S-reduced, we must have αi = 0 for all i. Hence
the set of S-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials is linearly independent. 



   As a corollary, we obtain a purely combinatorial proof of the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt
Theorem.

Proposition 2.11
   Let L = L0̄ ⊕ L1̄ be a Lie superalgebra with a linear basis Z = {z1 , z2 , . . . } such that
each zi is homogeneous with respect to the Z2 -grading. Then a linear basis of the universal
enveloping algebra U(L) of L is given by the set of all elements of the form zi1 zi2 . . . zin
where ik ≤ ik+1 and ik 6= ik+1 if zik ∈ L1̄ .

Proof.   Let Y = {y1 , y2, . . . } be a Z2 -graded set identified with the set Z by a map ι
such that ι(yi ) = zi and ι(Yα ) = Zα with α ∈ Z2 . Let LY be the free Lie superalgebra
generated by Y . Let S ⊂ LY be the set of elements of the form
                                                  X
                                                     k
                                       [yi yj ] −   αij yk

                                          k
where i ≥ j and i 6= j if yi ∈ Y0̄ , and αij is the structure constants given by the equation
          P k                                                                           
[zi zj ] = k αij zk in L. Let I be the ideal of LY generated by S. Then, clearly, LY I is
isomorphic to L and the set of S-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials is just the set
Y . By Proposition 2.9 the set S is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for L and then by Theorem
2.8 the set S is also a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for U(L). Now our assertion follows from
Theorem 2.10. 



    Let S be a set of relations in the free Lie superalgebra LX generated by X. We will
see how one can complete the set S to get a Gröbner-Shirshov basis. For any subset
T of LX , we define Tb = {p/α | α ∈ k is the leading coefficient of p ∈ T }. Let S (0) = Sb
and S(0) = {hf, giw 6≡L 0 mod (S (0) , w)| f, g ∈ S (0) }. For i ≥ 1, set S(i) = {hf, giw 6≡L
0 mod (S (i) , w)| f, g ∈ S (i) } and S (i) = S (i−1) ∪ Sb(i−1) .
                          S
    Then the set S c = i≥0 S (i) is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the (Lie) ideal I generated
by S in LX . Hence, by Lemma 2.7, it is also a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the (associative)
ideal J generated by S in AX . It is easy to see that if every element of S is homogeneous
in xi ∈ X, then every element of S c is also homogeneous in xi ’s.


3     Kac-Moody superalgebras
We now investigate the structure of Gröbner-Shirshov bases for Kac-Moody superalge-
bras. Our result is a generalization of the work by Bokut and Malcolmson [14] on the
Gröbner-Shirshov bases for Kac-Moody algebras. In the section, since we will consider
the associative congruences only, we will use the notation ≡ in place of ≡A .


                                              10
   Let Ω = {1, 2, . . . , r} be a finite index set and τ be a subset of Ω. A square matrix
A = (aij )i,j∈Ω is called a generalized Cartan Matrix if it satisfies:
                 (i) aii = 2 or 0 for i = 1, . . . , r and if aii = 0, then i ∈ τ ,
                 (ii) if aii 6= 0, then aij ∈ Z≤0 for i 6= j,
                 (iii) aij = 0 implies aji = 0,
                 (iv) if aii = 2 and i ∈ τ , then aij ∈ 2Z.
Let E = {ei }i∈Ω , H = {hi }i∈Ω , F = {fi }i∈Ω , and X = E ∪ H ∪ F . We define a Z2 -
grading on Ω by setting deg i = 0̄ for i ∈    / τ and deg i = 1̄ for i ∈ τ , and on X by
deg ei = deg fi = deg i and deg hi = 0̄. We give a linear ordering on X by ei ≻ hj ≻ fk
for all i, j, k ∈ Ω and ei ≻ ej , hi ≻ hj , fi ≻ fj when i > j. Then we have the lexico-
graphic ordering and length-lexicographic ordering as in Section 2. We denote the left
                                                                       f The Kac-Moody
adjoint action of a Lie algebra by ad and the right adjoint action by ad.

ak,k+1 + ak,k−1 = 0. Let S± = S±,1 ∪ S±,2 and S(A, τ ) = S+ ∪ W ∪ S− . We denote by G+
(resp. G0 and G− ) the subalgebra of G generated by E (resp. H and F ).
    Set tij = [ei fj ] − δi,j hi , which belong to the relations W . We define the differential
substitution ∂˜j = ∂(e
                     ˜ j → hj ) acting as a right superderivation on AE by

                  (ei )∂˜j = δij hj ,

                 (uv)∂˜j = u(v)∂˜j + (−1)(deg j)(deg v) (u)∂˜j v           for u, v ∈ AE .

It is easy to prove that for any p ∈ AE ,

(3.4)                pfj ≡ (−1)(deg p)(deg j) fj p + (p)∂˜j        mod (W, w).

for some w ≫ pfj . Note that ∂˜j is also a right superderivation on LE .

Lemma 3.1 Let p be a homogeneous monic element of AE such that (p, tij )w is defined
for w ∈ X ∗ . Then we have

                           (p, tij )w ≡ (p)∂˜j       mod ({p} ∪ W, w).

Proof. It suffices to consider the composition of intersection. We can write p = p + p′
with p = bei , where all the terms of p′ are lower than p. Then w = pfj = bei fj . Since p
is homogeneous, deg p = deg p′ . From (3.4), we have

                    (p, tij )w = pfj − b(ei fj − (−1)(deg i)(deg j) fj ei − δij hj )
                              = p′ fj + (−1)(deg i)(deg j) bfj ei + δij bhj
                              ≡ (−1)(deg p)(deg j) (fj p′ + fj bei ) + (p′ )∂˜j

                              ≡ (p)∂˜j mod ({p} ∪ W, w).

   In the rest of this paper, we shall omit brackets whenever it is convenient. Namely,
the Lie product [a, b] will be written as ab. Moreover, (adx)n y will be written as xn y and
  f n as xy n . It would be clear from the context whether a product ab means a Lie
x(ady)
product or not.

                                                       (i)
                       hq, riw ∂˜j ≡ (q, r)w ∂˜j mod (S+ ∪ W, l(p)).

Thus it is enough to show that (q, r)w ∂˜j ≡ 0 mod (S+ ∪ W, l(p)). Write p = (q, r)w =
                                                     (i)

qa − br. Then by the induction hypothesis, we have

                       (q, r)w ∂˜j =q(a)∂˜j + (−1)(deg a)(deg j) (q)∂˜j a
                                    − b(r)∂˜j − (−1)(deg r)(deg j) (b)∂˜j r
                                                       (i)
                                     ≡0       mod (S+ ∪ W, l(p)).

  



   Combining Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.3, we obtain:

Proposition 3.4 For any element p ∈ S+c , we have

                       hp, tij iw ≡ (p, tij )w ≡ 0   mod (S+c ∪ W, w).

    Proposition 3.4 implies that all the compositions between the relations in S+c and W
are trivial. Similarly, one can show that all the compositions between the relations in S−c
and W are also trivial. Now we can present the main theorem of this section.

Theorem 3.5 Let G = G(A, τ ) be a Kac-Moody superalgebra with the set of defining
relations S(A, τ ) = S+ ∪ W ∪ S− . Then the set S+c ∪ W ∪ S−c is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis
for the Kac-Moody superalgebra G(A, τ ). That is, S(A, τ )c = S+c ∪ W ∪ S−c . Hence it is
also a Gröbner- Shirshov basis for the universal enveloping algebra U(G) of G(A, τ ).




                                               14
Proof. By definition, there is no nontrivial composition among the relations in S±c and
the relations in S+c and S−c . Also, all the compositions between the relations in S±c and
W are trivial (see the remark after Proposition 3.4). Thus we have only to consider the
compositions among the elements in W . We will show that hp, qiw ≡ 0 mod (W, w) for all
p, q ∈ W , where w ∈ X ∗ is determined by p and q. There are four cases to be considered.
    If p = hi hj (i > j) and q = hj hk (j > k), then w = hi hj hk and

                           hp, qiw = [w]p − [w]q = (hi hj )hk − hi (hj hk )
                                   = (hi hj )hk ≡ 0.

If p = ej hi + αij ej and q = hi hk (i > k), then w = ej hi hk and

                      hp, qiw = [w]p − [w]q = (ej hi )hk + aij ej hk − ej (hi hk )
                              = (ej hk )hi + aij ej hk ≡ −akj ej hi + aij ej hk
                              ≡ akj aij ej − akj aij ej = 0.

Similarly, if p = hi hj (i > j) and q = hj fk + ajk fk , then hp, qiw ≡ 0. Finally, if p =
ej hi + aij ej and q = hi fk + aik fk , then w = ej hi fk and

               hp, qiw = [w]p − [w]q = (ej hi )fk + aij ej fk − ej (hi fk ) − aik ej fk
                        = (ej fk )hi + aij ej fk − aik ej fk
                        ≡ δjk hj hi + δjk aij aij hj − δjk aik hj ≡ 0,

which completes the proof.         



   As a corollary, we obtain the triangular decomposition of Kac-Moody superalgebras
and their universal enveloping algebras.

Corollary 3.6 Let G = G(A, τ ) be a Kac-Moody superalgebra. Then we have

(3.5)                                    G∼
                                          = G+ ⊕ G0 ⊕ G−

and

(3.6)                           U(G) ∼
                                     = U(G+ ) ⊗ U(G0 ) ⊗ U(G− )

as k-linear spaces.



                                                   15
Proof.      Observe that any super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomial of degree ≥ 2 cannot be
W -reduced if it contains hi or ej fk as a subword. Hence by Theorem 3.5, the set B of
S(A, τ )c -reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials is given by B = B+ ∪ H ∪ B− , where
B+ (resp. B− ) is the set of S+c -reduced (resp. S−c -reduced) super-Lyndon-Shirshov mono-
mials in ei ’s (resp. fi ’s). By Theorem 2.10, B is a linear basis of G, which proves the
k-linear isomorphism (3.5). The isomorphism (3.6) follows from the Poincaré-Birkhoff-
Witt Theorem. 




4     Classical Lie superalgebras
In this section, we will give an explicit construction of Gröbner-Shirshov bases for the
classical Lie superalgebras. A Gröbner-Shirshov basis S is said to be minimal if no
proper subset of S is closed under the Lie composition. We first set up some notations.
Recall that we omit brackets whenever it is convenient. For the elements xi ∈ X, we set
[x1 x2 . . . xm ] = x1 [x2 . . . xm ] and {x1 . . . xm−1 xm } = {x1 . . . xm−1 }xm (m ≥ 1). If i > j, we
will write xij = [xi xi−1 · · · xj ]. For simplicity, we will also denote xii = xi . We will use
the lexicographical ordering for the set I × I: (i, j) > (k, l) if and only if i > k or i = k,
j > l.
    We briefly recall the definition of classical Lie superalgebras [21]. Let V = V0̄ ⊕ V1̄
be a Z2 -graded vector space with dim V0̄ = m and dim V1̄ = n, and let L be the space of
k-linear endomorphisms of V . For each α ∈ Z2 , set

                      Lα = {T : V → V | T (Vβ ) ⊂ Vα+β for all β ∈ Z2 }.

Then L has a Z2 -graded decomposition L = L0̄ ⊕ L1̄ and it becomes a Lie superalgebra
with the superbracket defined by

                                    [X, Y ] = XY − (−1)αβ Y X

for X ∈ Lα , Y ∈ Lβ , α, β ∈ Z2 . The Lie superalgebra L is called the general linear Lie
superalgebra and is denoted by gl(m, n).
    Let v1 , · · · , vm be a basis of V0̄ and vm+1 , · · · , vm+n be a basis of V1̄ . Then L can be
interpreted as the space of (m + n) × (m + n) matrices over k, and we have
                    (        !                                                          )
                        A 0 
          L0̄ =                  A is an m × m matrix and D is an n × n matrix ,
                        0 D

                                                  16
                   (     !                                                          )
                    0 B 
           L1̄ =             B is an m × n matrix and C is an n × m matrix .
                    C 0
                      !
                 A B
   For X =               ∈ gl(m, n), we define the supertrace of X to be strX = trA −
                 C D
trB, where tr denotes the usual trace function. Then the subspace sl(m, n) of gl(m, n)
consisting of the matrices with supertrace 0 forms a Lie superalgebra which is called the
special linear Lie superalgebra.
   Let B be a nondegenerate consistent supersymmetric bilinear form on V . Thus V0̄
and V1̄ are orthogonal to each other, B|V0̄ ×V0̄ is symmetric, and B|V1̄ ×V1̄ is skew-symmetric
(which implies n must be even). For each α ∈ Z2 , define

   osp(m, n)α = {T ∈ gl(m, n)α | B(T v, w) = −(−1)α(degv) B(v, T w) for all v, w ∈ V }.

Then the subspace osp(m, n) = osp(m, n)0̄ ⊕ osp(m, n)1̄ becomes a Lie superalgebra. We
set

                           B(m, n) = osp(2m + 1, 2n) (m ≥ 0, n > 0),
(4.1)                         C(n) = osp(2, 2n − 2) (n ≥ 2),
                          D(m, n) = osp(2m, 2n) (m ≥ 2, n > 0).

These subalgebras are called the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebras of type B(m, n), C(n),
and D(m, n), respectively.


4.1     The special linear Lie superalgebra sl(m, n) (m, n > 0)
Let Eij denote the (m + n) × (m + n) matrix whose (i, j)-entry is equal to 1 and all the
other entries are 0, and let

(4.2)                  xi = Ei,i+1 , yi = Ei+1,i    (i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n − 1).

Then the elements xi , yi, zi = [xi , yi ] (i = 1, 2, · · · , m+n−1) generate the Lie superalgebra
sl(m, n).
   On the other hand, let Ω = {1, 2, · · · , m + n − 1}, τ = {m} ⊂ Ω, and consider the
generalized Cartan matrix A = (aij )i,j∈Ω defined by

             am,m = 0, am,m+1 = 1, am+1,m = −1,
(4.3)        aij = −1 if |i − j| = 1 and (i, j) 6= (m, m + 1),
             aij                                                     = 0 if |i − j| > 1.

                                                   17
Let G = G(A, τ ) be the Kac-Moody superalgebra associated with (A, τ ) and denote by
ei , fi , hi (i = 1, · · · , m + n − 1) the generators of G. Then it is straightforward to verify
that the generators xi , yi , zi (i = 1, · · · , m + n − 1) of the Lie superalgebra sl(m, n) also
satisfy the defining relations of the Kac-Moody algebra G = G(A, τ ). Hence there exists
a surjective Lie superalgebra homomorphism φ : G → sl(m, n) given by ei 7→ xi , fi 7→ yi ,
hi 7→ zi (i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n − 1).
     In the following lemma, we will derive more “refined” relations of G, which will be
used to construct a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the special linear Lie superalgebra sl(m, n).
Recall that we use the notation eij = [ei ei−1 · · · ej ] for i > j and eii = ei .

Lemma 4.1 In the Kac-Moody superlagebra G = G(A, τ ), we have

(4.4)                        eij ekl = δj−1,k eil   for all (i, j) ≥ (k, l).

Proof.    We will proceed in several steps.
Step 1: For all j > k + 1, we have eij ekl = 0.
   By the Serre relations, we have ej el = 0 for all j > l + 1. Next, fix l and assume that
j > k + 1, k > l. Then by the Jacobi identity and induction hypothesis, we get

                 ej ekl = ej (ek ek−1,l ) = (ej ek )ek−1,l + (−1)d ek (ej ek−1,l ) = 0,

where d = (degej )(degek ) ∈ Z2 . Finally, fix j and assume that i > j > k + 1. Then the
induction argument yields

                eij ekl = (ei ei−1,j )ekl = ei (ei−1,j ekl ) + (−1)d (ei ekl )ei−1,j = 0,

where d = (degei )(degei−1 ) ∈ Z2 .
Step 2: For all i, j, k ∈ Ω, we have eij ej−1,k = eik .
   If i = j, there is nothing to prove. If i > j, then by induction argument and Step 1,
we obtain

             eij ej−1,k = (ei ei−1,j )ej−1,k = ei (ei−1,j ej−1,k ) + (−1)d (ei ej−1,k )ei−1,j
                       = eii ei−1,k = eik ,

where d = (degei )(degei−1 ) ∈ Z2 .
Step 3: For all i > j, we have ei eij = 0 and eij ej = 0.



                                                    18
     By the Serre relations, we have ei ei,i−1 = 0. If i ≥ j + 2, then Step 2 implies eij =
ei,i−1 ei−2,j . Hence by Step 1, we obtain

             ei eij = ei (ei,i−1 ei−2,j ) = (ei ei,i−1 )ei−2,j + (−1)d ei,i−1 (ei ei−2,j ) = 0,

where d = (degei )(degei,i−1 ) ∈ Z2 .
   Similarly, we get eij ej = 0 for i > j.
Step 4: For all k, l ≥ 1, we have hi ei+k,i−l = 0.
   By the relations in W , we obtain

                          hi ei+k,i−l = (ai,i+1 + aii + ai,i−1 )ei+k,i−l = 0.

Step 5: For all i > j, we have eij ei−1 = 0.
   If j = i − 1, then by the Serre relations, we get eij ei−1 = 0. Suppose first that j < i − 1
and i − 1 6= m. The by Step 3, we obtain

            (eij ei−1 )ei−1 = ((ei ei−1,j )ei−1 )ei−1
                            = (ei (ei−1,j ei−1 ) + (−1)d (ei ei−1 )ei−1,j )ei−1
                                                                        ′
                            = (−1)d (ei ei−1 )(ei−1,j ei−1 ) + (−1)d ((ei ei−1 )ei−1 )ei−1,j
                            = 0,

where d = (degei )(degei−1 ) and d′ = (degei−1 )(degei−1,j ). Multiplying both sides by fi−1
yields

                    0 = ((eij ei−1 )ei−1 )fi−1
                       = (eij ei−1 )(ei−1 fi−1 ) + ((eij ei−1 )fi−1 )ei−1
                       = (eij ei−1 )hi−1 + (eij hi−1 )ei−1 + ((eij fi−1 )ei−1 )ei−1 .

The second summand is equal to 0 by Step 4. Since eij fi−1 is a scalar multiple of ei ei−2,j ,
the third summand is also equal to 0. By the Jacobi identity and Step 4, the first summand
yields 2eij ei−1 = 0, which proves our claim.
    If j < i − 1 and i − 1 = m, since (em+1 em )(em em−1 ) = 0 by the Serre relations, we get

           em+1,j em = em+1 (emj em ) − (em+1 em )emj
                      = −(em+1 em )(em (em−1 em−2,j ))
                      = −(em+1 em )((em em−1 )em−2,j )
                      = −((em+1 em )(em em−1 ))em−2,j + (em em−1 )((em+1 em )em−2,j )= 0.

                                                    19
Step 6: For all n > k ≥ 0, m > l ≥ 0, we have em+k,m−l em+k,m−l = 0.
   Suppose k = 0. If l = 0, then we have to show that em em = 0. Note that

               0 = em (em em−1 ) = (em em )em−1 − em (em em−1 ) = (em em )em−1 .

Multiplying both sides by fm−1 , we obtain
                        0 = ((em em )em−1 )fm−1
                          = (em em )(em−1 fm−1 ) + ((em em )fm−1 )em−1
                          = (em em )hm−1 = 2em em ,
which implies em em = 0.
   Next, suppose l > 0. If em,m−l em,m−l = 0, then
                   0 = ((em,m−l em,m−l )em−l−1 )em−l−1
                     = (em,m−l em,m−l−1 )em−l−1 + (em,m−l−1 em,m−l )em−l−1
                     = 2em,m−l−1 em,m−l−1 ,
which yields em,m−l−1 em,m−l−1 = 0. Hence, by the downward induction, we conclude
em,m−l em,m−l = 0 for all m > l ≥ 0.
   Finally, if k > 0, then our assertion follows from the same downward induction argu-
ment as above.
Step 7: For all k ≥ k ′ , l ≤ l′ , we have em+k,m−l em+k′ ,m−l′ = 0.
   Suppose k ′ = k. If l = l′ , then our assertion was proved in Step 6. If l < l′ and
em+k,m−l em+k,m−l′ = 0, then
                  0 = (em+k,m−l em+k,m−l′ )em−l′ −1
                    = em+k,m−l (em+k,m−l′ −1 ) + (em+k,m−l em−l′ −1 )em+k,m−l′
                    = em+k,m−l em+k,m−l′ −1 .
Hence by the downward induction, we get em+k,m−l em+k,m−l′ = 0 for all l ≤ l′ .
   If k > k ′ , our assertion follows by the same downward induction argument.
Step 8: For all i ≥ j > 1, we have eij ei,j−1 = 0.
   If i = j, then our assertion is just the Serre relation. Suppose i > j and i + 1 6= m.
Then if eij ei,j−1 = 0, we have
                        0 = ei+1 (ei+1 (eij ei,j−1))
                          = ei+1 (ei+1,j ei,j−1 ) + (−1)d ei+1 (eij ei+1,j−1 )
                                   ′
                          = (−1)d ei+1,j ei+1,j−1 + (−1)d ei+1,j ei+1,j−1 ,

                                                 20
where d = (deg ei+1 )(deg eij ) and d′ = (deg ei+1 )(deg ei+1,j ). Since i + 1 6= m, we have
ei+1,j ei+1,j−1 = 0 and the induction argument gives our relations. If i > j, i + 1 = m and
eij ei,j−1 = 0, then by Step 7, we get ei+1,j ei+1,j−1 = emj em,j−1 = 0. Hence our assertion
follows from the induction.
Step 9: For all k 6= j − 1, (i, j) ≥ (k, l), we have eij ekl = 0.
    Fix k = i. If l = j, then our assertion holds by Step 6. If l = j − 1, then it is just Step
8. If l < j − 1, then, by Step 1 and Step 8, we have

                     eij eil = eij (ei,j−1 ej−2,l )
                            = (eij ei,j−1 )ej−2,l + (−1)d ei,j−1(eij ej−2,l ) = 0,

where d = (deg eij )(deg ei,j−1 ) ∈ Z2 .
   Suppose k < i. If j > k + 1, our assertion holds by Step 1. Let us assume k ≥ j. If
k = l, then we may assume k < i − 1 by Step 5, and we have

                     eij ek = (ei,k+2ek+1,j )ek
                            = ei,k+2(ek+1,j ek ) + (−1)d (ei,k+2ek )ek+1,j = 0.

We shall use induction on k − l. Note that if k > l, then we have

                  eij ekl = eij (ek ek−1,l ) = (eij ek )ek−1,l + (−1)d ek (eij ek−1,l ),

where d = (deg eij )(deg ek ) ∈ Z2 . The first summand is equal to 0 by the case k = l.
Consider the second summand. If j 6= k, then it is 0 by the induction hypothesis. If
j = k, then by Step 2, it is equal to

                              (−1)d ek (eik ek−1,l ) = (−1)d ek eil = 0.

       I. ei ej (i > j + 1),
      II. eij ei−1 (i > j),
     III. eij ei,j−1 (i ≥ j > 1),
     IV. em+k,m−l em+k,m−l (n > k ≥ 0, m > l ≥ 0).

                                                      21
    Let R− be the set of relations in F # obtained by replacing eij ’s in R+ by fij ’, and
let R(A, τ ) = R+ ∪ W ∪ R− . Consider the Lie superalgebra L = LX /hR(A, τ )i, where
hR(A, τ )i denotes the ideal in LX generated by R(A, τ ). Then, by Lemma 4.1, there is
a surjective Lie superalgebra homomorphism ψ : L → G defined by ei 7→ ei , hi 7→ hi ,
fi 7→ fi (i ∈ Ω). We now prove the main result of this subsection.

Theorem 4.2 The set R(A, τ ) of relations in LX is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the Lie
superalgebra L.

Proof.   Set R = R(A, τ ). As in the proof of Corollary 3.6, the set of R(A, τ )-reduced
super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials is B = B+ ∪ H ∪ B− , where B± is the set of R± -
reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials in LE (resp. in LF ). We claim that the set of
R+ -reduced Lyndon-Shirshov monomials in LE is
                               ′
                              B+ = {eij |m + n > i ≥ j ≥ 1}.

Let w be an R+ -reduced Lyndon-Shirshov monomial in LE . If l(w) = 1, then there is
nothing to prove. Suppose that l(w) > 1. Then w = uv, where u, v are R+ -reduced
Lyndon-Shirshov monomials. By induction, we have w = eij ekl , where i ≥ j, k ≥ l and
(i, j) > (k, l) in the lexicographical ordering. Note that we must have i > k, for if i = k,
then j − 1 ≥ l and eij ei,j−1 is a subword of w. We will show that k = j − 1 and i = j.
If k > j, then w contains ek+1,j ek as a subword, and if k = j, then w contains (ek+1 ek )ek
as a subword. Finally, if k ≤ j − 2, then w contains ej ek as a subword. Hence we must
have k = j − 1. Moreover, since w is a Lyndon-Shirshov monomial, we must have i = j.
Therefore, we obtain w = eil , which proves our claim.
     Now, let w be an R+ -reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomial in LE s. Then w is
a Lyndon-Shirshov monomial or w = uu with u a Lyndon-Shirshov monomial in E1̄# . If
the latter is true, then, as we have seen in the previous paragraph, we have u = em+k,m−l
(n > k ≥ 0, m > l ≥ 0), in which case w is not R+ -reduced by IV. Therefore we have
                                ′
                          B+ = B+ = {eij |m + n > i ≥ j ≥ 1}.

Similarly, we get B− = {fij |m + n > i ≥ j ≥ 1}.
   By Lemma 2.4, B spans L. Since φ and ψ are surjective, we have card(B) ≥
dim sl(m, n). But the number of elements of B is (m + n)2 − 1, which is equal to the
dimension of sl(m, n). Thus φ and ψ are isomorphisms and B is a linear basis of L.
Therefore, by Proposition 2.9, R is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for L. 




                                            22
Remark. The proof of Theorem 4.2 shows that the Lie superalgebras L, G(A, τ ) and
sl(m, n) are all isomorphic. Hence Theorem 4.2 gives a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the
Lie superalgebra sl(m, n). Our argument also shows that R(A, τ ) is actually a minimal
Gröbner-Shirshov basis.



4.2     The Lie superalgebras of type B(m, n) (m, n > 0)
Let Eij denotes the (2m + 2n + 1) × (2m + 2n + 1) matrix whose (i, j)-entry is 1 and all
the other entries are 0. Set

                xi = E2m+i+1,2m+i+2 − E2m+n+i+2,2m+n+i+1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
                xn = E2m+n+1,1 + Em+1,2m+2n+1 ,
                xn+i = Ei,i+1 − Em+i+1,m+i (1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1),
                        √
                xm+n = 2(Em,2m+1 − E2m+1,2m ),
(4.5)
                yi = E2m+i+2,2m+i+1 − E2m+n+i+1,2m+n+i+2 (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
                yn = E1,2m+n+1 − E2m+2n+1,m+1 ,
                yn+i = Ei+1,i − Em+i,m+i+1 (1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1),
                        √
                ym+n = 2(E2m+1,m − E2m,2m+1 ).

Then the elements xi , yi , zi = [xi , yi ] (i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n) generate the ortho-symplectic
Lie superalgebra B(m, n) = osp(2m + 1, 2n) (m, n > 0) and xn , yn are the odd generators.
    On the other hand, let Ω = {1, 2, . . . m+n}, τ = {n} ⊂ Ω, and consider the generalized
Cartan matrix A = (aij )i,j∈Ω defined by

              an,n = 0,    an,n+1 = 1,      am+n,m+n−1 = −2,
(4.6)         aij = −1 if |i − j| = 1, (i, j) 6= (n, n + 1), (m + n, m + n − 1),
              aij = 0     if |i − j| > 1.

Let G = G(A, τ ) be the Kac-Moody superalgebra associated with (A, τ ) and denote by
ei , fi , hi (i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n) the generators of G. Then, as in the case of sl(m, n),
one can verify that the generators xi , yi, zi (i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n) of the Lie superalgebra
osp(2m + 1, 2n) satisfy the defining relations of the Kac-Moody superalgebra G(A, τ ).
Hence there exists a surjective Lie superalgebra homomorphism φ : G → osp(2m + 1, 2n)
given by ei 7→ xi , fi 7→ yi, hi 7→ zi (i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n). As in Section 4.1, we first
derive more relations in G, which will be used to construct a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for
the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra B(m, n) = osp(2m + 1, 2n) (m, n > 0).

                                                 23
Lemma 4.3 In the Kac-Moody superalgebra G = G(A, τ ), we have

                       eij ekl = δj−1,k eil if (i, j) ≥ (k, l), m + n > k,
(4.7)                  [em+n,i em+n,j em+n,k ] = 0 (i, j, k ∈ Ω),
                       (em+n,i em+n,j )(em+n,k em+n,l ) = 0 (i, j, k, l ∈ Ω).

Proof.    As in Lemma 4.1, we will prove our assertion in several steps.
Step 1: For all (i, j) > (k, l) and m + n > k, we have eij ekl = δj−1,k eil .
    If we remove the (m + n)-th row and the (m + n)-th column of A, then we get
the generalized Cartan matrix for the Lie superalgebra sl(m, n). Thus we have only to
consider the case when i = m + n. Suppose k ≤ m + n − 2. If j = m + n, then em+n ekl = 0
as in Step 1 of the proof of Lemma 4.1. If j < m + n, then we have

                  em+n,j ekl = (em+n em+n−1,j )ekl
                            = em+n (em+n−1,j ekl ) + (−1)d (em+n ekl )em+n−1,j
                            = δj−1,k em+n em+n−1,l = δj−1,k em+n,l ,

where d = (deg em+n )(deg em+n−1,j ).
   If k = m + n − 1 and j = m + n, then em+n em+n−1,l = em+n,l and if j < m + n − 1,
then

           em+n,j em+n−1,l = em+n,j (em+n−1 em+n−2,l )
                           = (em+n,j em+n−1 )em+n−2,l + (−1)d em+n−1 (em+n,j em+n−2,l )
                           = (em+n,j em+n−1 )em+n−2,l + (−1)d δj−1,m+n−2 em+n−1 em+n,l ,

where d = (deg em+n,j )(deg em+n−1 ). As in Step 5 of the proof of Lemma 4.1, we have
em+n,j em+n−1 = 0, which proves our claim.
Step 2: For all i ∈ Ω, we have [em+n em+n em+n,i ] = 0.
  It is clear that [em+n em+n em+n ] = 0. Suppose that [em+n em+n em+n,i ] = 0 for i < m+n.
Multiplying both sides by ei−1 , we obtain

                0 = [em+n em+n em+n,i ]ei−1
                  = em+n ((em+n em+n,i )ei−1 ) + (−1)d (em+n ei−1 )(em+n em+n,i )
                                                     ′
                  = em+n (em+n em+n,i−1 ) + (−1)d em+n ((em+n ei−1 )em+n,i )
                  = [em+n em+n em+n,i−1 ]

for d, d′ ∈ Z2 , and the downward induction on i gives our claim.

                                                24
Step 3: [em+n em+n em+n−1 ](em+n em+n−1 ) = 0.
   If m 6= 1, then by the Serre relation, we get

          [em+n em+n em+n−1 ](em+n em+n−1 )
           = ([em+n em+n em+n−1 ]em+n )em+n−1 + em+n ([em+n em+n em+n−1 ]em+n−1 )
           = −[em+n em+n em+n em+n−1 ]em+n−1 + em+n (em+n {em+n em+n−1 em+n−1 }) = 0.

If m = 1, then

             [en+1 en+1 en ](en+1 en ) = ([en+1 en+1 en ]en+1 )en + en+1 ([en+1 en+1 en ]en )
             = en+1 (en+1 {en+1 en en }) − en+1 ((en+1 en )(en+1 en ))
             = −[en+1 en+1 en ](en+1 en ) − (en+1 en )[en+1 en+1 en ]
             = −2[en+1 en+1 en ](en+1 en ),

which yields [en+1 en+1 en ][en+1 en ] = 0.
Step 4: For all i ∈ Ω, we have

               [em+n em+n em+n−1 ]em+n,i = 0, (em+n em+n,i )(em+n em+n−1 ) = 0.

   Let a = [em+n em+n em+n−1 ]em+n,i and b = (em+n em+n,i )(em+n em+n−1 ). If m 6= 1, then
by Step 2 and Step 3, we obtain

                 0 = [em+n em+n em+n,i ]em+n−1
                   = em+n {em+n em+n,i em+n−1 } + (em+n em+n−1 )(em+n em+n,i )
                   = em+n {em+n em+n−1 em+m,i } − b = a − 2b,

and

          0 =([em+n em+n em+n−1 ](em+n em+n−1 ))em+n−2,i
               = [em+n em+n em+n−1 ]em+n,i + ([em+n em+n em+n−1 ]em+n−2,i )(em+n em+n−1 )
               = a + em+n {em+n em+n−1 em+n−2,i }(em+n em+n−1 ) = a + b.

Hence we have a = b = 0. Similarly, if m = 1, then we get a + b = 0 and a + 2b = 0,
which implies a = b = 0.
Step 5: For all i, j ∈ Ω, we have {em+n em+n,i em+n,j } = 0.
   If j = m + n or j = m + n − 1, our assertion holds by Step 2 and Step 4. We will use
the downward induction on j. Suppose j < m + n − 1 and {em+n em+n,i em+n,j } = 0 for all


                                                   25
i ∈ Ω. Then we have
                      0 = {em+n em+n,i em+n,j }ej−1
                           = (em+n em+n,i )em+n,j + ((em+n em+n,i )ej−1 )em+n,j
                           = {em+n em+n,i em+n,j−1 } + δij (em+n em+n,i−1 )em+n,j
                           = {em+n em+n,i em+n,j−1 },
which proves our claim.
Step 6: For all i, j, k ∈ Ω, we have [em+n,i em+n,j em+n,k ] = 0.
    If i = m + n, Step 5 implies

            em+n (em+n,j em+n,k ) = (em+n em+n,j )em+n,k + em+n,j (em+n em+n,k ) = 0.

If i < m + n, by the above observation, we get
             [em+n,i em+n,j em+n,k ] = (em+n em+n−1,i )(em+n,j em+n,k )
             = em+n [em+n−1,i em+n,j em+n,k ] + (−1)d [em+n em+n,j em+n,k ]em+n−1,i
                       ′                                      ′′
             = (−1)d δm+n,j [em+n em+n,i em+n,k ] + (−1)d δm+n,k [em+n em+n,j em+n,i ] = 0,
where d, d′ , d′′ ∈ Z2 .
    It remains to prove the last relation. But it is an immediate consequence of Step 6.




   Let X = E∪H ∪F = {ei , hi , fi | i ∈ Ω} be a Z2 -graded set, where Ω = {1, 2, · · · , m+n}
and τ = {n} is the set of odd index. Let R+ be the set of relations in E # given by:
       I. ei ej (m + n ≥ i > j + 1 > 1),
      II. eij ei−1 (m + n ≥ i > j ≥ 1),
     III. eij ei,j−1 (m + n > i ≥ j > 1),
     IV. en+k,n−l en+k,n−l (m > k ≥ 0, n > l ≥ 0),
      V. [em+n,i em+n,j em+n,j−1 ] (m + n ≥ i ≥ j > 1),
     VI. {em+n,i em+n,j em+n,i−1 } (m + n ≥ i > j ≥ 1),
    VII. (em+n,i em+n,j )(em+n,i em+n,j ) (m + n ≥ i > n ≥ j ≥ 1),
   VIII. (em+n,i em+n,j )(em+n,i em+n,j−1 ) (n ≥ i > j > 1).
    Let R− be the set of relations in F # obtained by replacing eij ’s in R+ by fij ’s, and
let R(A, τ ) = R+ ∪ W ∪ R− . Consider the Lie superalgebra L = LX /hR(A, τ )i. Then, by
Lemma 4.3, there exists a surjective Lie superalgebra homomorphism ψ : L → G defined
by ei 7→ ei , hi 7→ hi and fi 7→ fi (i ∈ Ω). Then we have :

                                                   26
Theorem 4.4 The set R(A, τ ) of the relations in LX is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the
Lie superalgebra L.

Proof. Set R = R(A, τ ). As in the case of sl(m, n), the set of R(A, τ )-reduced super-
Lyndon-Shirshov monomials is B = B+ ∪ H ∪ B− . We claim that the set of R+ -reduced
Lyndon-Shirshov monomials in LE is
                          ′
                         B+ = {eij |i ≥ j} ∪ {em+n,i em+n,j |i > j}.

   Let w be an R+ -reduced Lyndon-Shirshov monomial in LE . If l(w) = 1, there is
nothing to prove. If l(w) > 1, then w = uv, where u, v are R+ -reduced Lyndon-Shirshov
                                                   ′
monomials. Hence by induction, we have u, v ∈ B+     . We will show that either u = em+n,j ,
v = em+n,l with j > l or u = ei , v = ei−1,l , which would prove our claim. We need to
consider the following four cases.
Case 1. u = eij , v = ekl   (i ≥ j, k ≥ l):
    Since uv is Lyndon-Shirshov, we have (i, j) > (k, l) lexicographically. If i = k = m+n,
then u = em+n,j , v = em+n,l with j > l. If i = k < m + n, then j − 1 ≥ l, and eij ekl
contains eij ei,j−1 as a subword. Hence w is not R+ -reduced by III. If i = j > k and
k = i − 1, then u and v have the desired form and we are done. If i = j > k and k ≤ i − 2,
then w is not R+ -reduced by I. If i > k and i > j, then we must have k = i − 1, since
eij = ei ei−1,j and ei−1,j ≤ ekl by the definition of Lyndon-Shirshov monomials. Hence w
is not R+ -reduced by II.
Case 2. u = ekl , v = em+n,i em+n,j    (i > j, k ≥ l):
   Since uv is Lyndon-Shirshov, we have k = m + n and l ≥ i. Then w is not R+ -reduced
by V, since w contains em+n,i (em+n,i em+n,i−1 ) as a subword.
Case 3. u = em+n,i em+n,j , v = ekl    (i > j, k ≥ l):
   Since uv is Lyndon-Shirshov, we have em+n,i > ekl ≥ em+n,j . It follows that k = m + n
and i > l ≥ j. Hence w contains {em+n,i em+n,j em+n,i−1 } as a subword, and w is not
R+ -reduced by VI.
Case 4. u = em+n,i em+n,j , v = em+n,k em+n,l      (i > j, k > l):
   Since uv is Lyndon-Shirshov, we have (i, j) > (k, l) and em+n,j ≤ em+n,k em+n,l . Thus
we have j < k and either i = k > j > l or i > k > j. If i = k > j > l, then w contains
(em+n,i em+n,j )(em+n,i em+n,j−1 ) as a subword, and w is not R+ -reduced by VII or VIII. If
i > k > j, then w contains {em+n,i em+n,j em+n,i−1 } as a subword, and w is not R+ -reduced
by VI.

                                              27
   Now, let w be an R+ - reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomial in LE . Then w is
Lyndon-Shirshov or w = uu with u a Lyndon-Shirshov monomial in E1̄# . If the latter is
true, then we have the following three possibilities:
   (i) u = en+k,n−l (m > k ≥ 0, n > l ≥ 0),
   (ii) u = em+n,j (1 ≤ j ≤ n),
   (iii) u = em+n,i em+n,j (m + n ≥ i > n ≥ j ≥ 1).
But the cases (i) and (iii) cannot occur by IV and VII. Therefore the set of R+ -reduced
super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials is given by

          B+ = {eij | i ≥ j} ∪ {em+n,i em+n,j | i > j} ∪ {em+n,j em+n,j |1 ≤ j ≤ n}.

Similarly, we get

         B− = {fij | i ≥ j} ∪ {fm+n,i fm+n,j | i > j} ∪ {fm+n,j fm+n,j |1 ≤ j ≤ n}.

By Lemma 2.4 B spans L. Since φ and ψ are surjective, we have card(B) ≥ dim osp(2m +
1, 2n). But the number of elements of B is 2(m + n)2 + m + 3n, which is equal to the
dimension of osp(2m + 1, 2n). Hence B is a linear basis of L and by Proposition 2.9,
R = R(A, τ ) is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the Lie superalgebra L. 



Remark. The proof of Theorem 4.4 shows that the Lie superalgebras L, G(A, τ ) and
B(m, n) = osp(2m + 1, 2n) are all isomorphic. Hence Theorem 4.4 gives a Gröbner-
Shirshov basis for the Lie superalgebra B(m, n) = osp(2m + 1, 2n). Our argument also
shows that R(A, τ ) is actually a minimal Gröbner-Shirshov basis.



4.3     The Lie superalgebras of type B(0, n) (n > 0)
Let Eij denotes the (2n + 1) × (2n + 1) matrix whose (i, j)-entry is 1 and all the other
entries are 0. Set
                      xi = Ei+1,i+2 − En+i+2,n+i+1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
                           √
                      xn = 2(E1,2n+1 + En+1,1 ),
(4.8)
                      yi = Ei+2,i+1 − En+i+1,n+i+2 (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
                           √
                      yn = 2(E1n − E2n+1,1 ).

Then the elements xi , yi , zi = [xi , yi] generate the Lie superalgebra B(0, n) = osp(1, 2n)
(n > 0) and xn , yn are the odd generators.

                                             28
   On the other hand, let Ω = {1, 2, . . . n}, τ = {n} ⊂ Ω, and consider the generalized
Cartan matrix A = (aij )i,j∈Ω defined by

                        an,n = 2,    an,n−1 = −2,
(4.9)                   aij = −1 if |i − j| = 1, (i, j) 6= (n, n − 1),
                        aij = 0     if |i − j| > 1.

Let G = G(A, τ ) be the Kac-Moody superalgebra associated with (A, τ ) and denote by ei ,
fi , hi (i = 1, 2, · · · , n) the generators of G. Then, by the same argument as in the proof
of Lemma 4.3, we obtain:

Lemma 4.5 In the Kac-Moody superalgebra G = G(A, τ ), we have

                          eij ekl = δj−1,k eil if (i, j) ≥ (k, l), n > k,
(4.10)                    [eni enj enk ] = 0 (i, j, k ∈ Ω),
                          (eni enj )(enk enl ) = 0 (i, j, k, l ∈ Ω).

    Let X = E ∪ H ∪ F = {ei , hi , fi | i ∈ Ω} be a Z2 -graded set, where Ω = {1, 2, · · · , n}
and τ = {n} ⊂ Ω is the set of odd index. Let R+ be the set of relations in E # given by:
        I. ei ej (n ≥ i > j + 1 > 1),
       II. eij ei−1 (n ≥ i > j ≥ 1),
      III. eij ei,j−1 (n > i ≥ j > 1),
      IV. [en,i en,j en,j−1] (n ≥ i ≥ j > 1),

      VI. (en,i en,j )(en,i en,j−1) (n ≥ i > j > 1).
    Let R− be the set of relations in F # obtained by replacing eij ’s in R+ by fij ’s, and let
R(A, τ ) = R+ ∪ W ∪ R− . Consider the Lie superalgebra L = LX /hR(A, τ )i. Then there
is a surjective Lie superalgebra homomorphism ψ : L → G, and using the same argument
as in the proof of Theorem 4.4, we obtain:

Theorem 4.6 The set R(A, τ ) of the relations in LX is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the
Lie superlagebra L.

Remark. The set of R+ -reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials in LE is given by

                            B+ = {eij |i ≥ j} ∪ {en,i en,j |i ≥ j},

and the Lie superalgebras L, G(A, τ ), and B(0, n) = osp(1, 2n) are all isomorphic. More-
over, R(A, τ ) is a minimal Gröbner-Shirshov basis.

4.4      The Lie superalgebras of type C(n) (n ≥ 2)
Let Eij denotes the (2n + 1) × (2n + 1) matrix whose (i, j)-entry is 1 and all the other
entries are 0. Set

                          x1 = E13 − En+2,2 ,
                          xi = Ei+1,i+2 − En+i+1,n+i        (2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
                          xn = En+1,2n ,
(4.11)
                          y1 = E31 + E2,n+2 ,
                          yi = Ei+2,i+1 − En+i,n+i+1       (2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
                          yn = E2n,n+1 .

Then the elements xi , yi , zi = [xi , yi ] (i = 1, 2, · · · , n) are the generators of the Lie
superalgebra C(n) = osp(2, 2n − 2), and x1 , y1 are the odd generators.
   Let Ω = {1, 2, . . . n}, τ = {1} ⊂ Ω and consider the generalized Cartan matrix
A = (aij )i,j∈Ω defined by

                       a11 = 0,        a12 = 1,   an−1,n = −2,
(4.12)                 aij = −1 if |i − j| = 1, (i, j) 6= (1, 2), (n − 1, n),
                       aij = 0     if |i − j| > 1.

Let G = G(A, τ ) be the Kac-Moody superalgebra associated with (A, τ ) and denote by
ei , fi , hi (i = 1, 2, · · · , n) the generators of G. Then there is a surjective Lie superalgebra
homomorphism φ : G → osp(2, 2n−2) given by ei 7→ xi , fi 7→ yi , hi 7→ zi (i = 1, 2, · · · , n).
     By a similar argument in the proof of Lemma 4.3, we can derive a more refined set of
relations in G, which gives a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the Lie superalgebra osp(2, 2n−2)
(n ≥ 2). Since the argument is a variation of the one given in Lemma 4.3, we omit the
proof here.

Lemma 4.7 In the Kac-Moody superalgebra G = G(A, τ ), we have

                eij ekl = δj−1,k eil    if (i, j) ≥ (k, l) and k 6= n − 1 when i = n,
                {eni en−1,j en−1,k } = 0 (n > i),
(4.13)
                {eni en−1,j enk } = 0 (i, j, k ∈ Ω),
                (eni en−1,j )(en,k en−1,l ) = 0 (i, j, k, l ∈ Ω).

   Let X = E ∪ H ∪ F = {ei , hi , fi | i ∈ Ω} be a Z2 -graded set, where Ω = {1, 2, · · · , n}
and τ = {1} ⊂ Ω is the set of odd index. Let R+ be the set of relations in E # given by:

                                                     30

    III.   eij ei,j−1 (n ≥ i ≥ j > 1),
    IV.    ei1 ei1 (n ≥ i ≥ 1),
     V.    {en,i en−1,j en−1 } (n > j ≥ i ≥ 1),
    VI.    {en,i en−1,j en,i−1 } (n > j ≥ i > 1),
   VII.    [en,i en,i en−1 ] (n ≥ i > 1),
   VIII.   (en,1 en−1,j )(en,1 en−1,j ) (n > j > 1),
    IX.    (en,i en−1,j )(en,i en−1,j−1) (n > j > i > 1).
    Let R− be the set of relations in F # obtained by replacing eij ’s in R+ by fij ’s, and let
R(A, τ ) = R+ ∪ W ∪ R− . Consider the Lie superalgebra L = LX /hR(A, τ )i. Then there
is a surjective Lie superalgebra homomorphism ψ : L → G defined by ei 7→ ei , fi 7→ fi ,
hi 7→ hi (i ∈ Ω). Moreover, we have:

Theorem 4.8 The set R(A, τ ) of the relations in LX is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for the
Lie superalgebra L.

Proof. Since our argument is similar to the one for the proof of Theorem 4.4, we just
give a sketch of the proof. We first prove that the set of R(A, τ )-reduced Lyndon-Shirshov
monomials in LX is given by
             ′
            B+ = {eij | i ≥ j} ∪ {en,i en−1,j | n > j ≥ i ≥ 1 and (i, j) 6= (1, 1)},

and conclude the set B+ of R+ -reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials in LE is equal
    ′
to B+ .
   We see that B = B+ ∪ H ∪ B− spans L, where

            B− = {fij | i ≥ j} ∪ {fn,i fn−1,j | n > j ≥ i ≥ 1 and (i, j) 6= (1, 1)}

is the set of R− -reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials in LF . The number of ele-
ments in B is 2n2 + n − 2, which is equal to the dimension of osp(2, 2n − 2) (n ≥ 2).
Hence the homomorphisms φ and ψ are isomorphisms, and B is a linear basis of L, which
proves our assertion. 



Remark. The Lie superalgebras L, G(A, τ ), and C(n) = osp(2, 2n − 2) are all isomorphic
and R(A, τ ) is a minimal Gröbner-Shirshov basis.

4.5      The Lie superalgebras of type D(m, n) (m ≥ 2, n > 0)
Let Eij denotes the (2m + 2n) × (2m + 2n) matrix whose (i, j)-entry is 1 and all the other
entries are 0. Set

                  xi = E2m+i,2m+i+1 − E2m+n+i+1,2m+n+i (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
                  xn = E2m+n,1 + Em+1,2m+2n ,
                  xn+i = Ei,i+1 − Em+i+1,m+i (1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1),
                  xm+n = Em,2m−1 − Em−1,2m ,
(4.14)
                  yi = E2m+i+1,2m+i − E2m+n+i,2m+n+i+1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
                  yn = E1,2m+n − E2m+2n,m+1 ,
                  yn+i = Ei+1,i − Em+i,m+i+1 (1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1),
                  ym+n = E2m−1,m − E2m,m−1 .

Then the elements xi , yi , zi = [xi , yi] (i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n) are the generators of the Lie
superalgebra D(m, n) = osp(2m, 2n), and xn , yn are the odd generators.
   Let Ω = {1, 2, . . . m + n}, τ = {n}, and consider the generalized Cartan matrix
A = (aij )i,j∈Ω defined by

                ann = 0,    an,n+1 = 1,    am+n−2,m+n = −1,
                am+n−1,m+n = 0 am+n,m+n−2 = −1,            am+n,m+n−1 = 0,

                aij = 0    if |i − j| > 1, and (i, j) 6= (m + n − 2, m + n),
                                     (m + n, m + n − 2).

    Let G = G(A, τ ) be the Kac-Moody superalgebra associated with (A, τ ) and denote
by ei , fi , hi (i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n) the generators of G. Then there is a surjective Lie
superalgebra homomorphism φ : G → osp(2m, 2n) given by ei 7→ xi , fi 7→ yi , hi 7→ zi
(i = 1, 2, · · · , m + n).
   We modify some of our notations:
   (i) We neglect em+n,m+m−1 ; if j ≤ m + n − 2, we write em+n,j = em+n em+n−2,j .
   (ii) We introduce a modified Kronecker’s delta:
                            
                            1    if i = jor i = j + 1 = m + n − 1,
                     δ̂ij =                                         .
                            0    otherwise.

                                               32
   In the following lemma, we will list a set of relations in G which would yield a Gröbner-
Shirshov basis for the Lie superalgebra D(m, n) = osp(2m, 2n) (m ≥ 2, n > 0). We will
omit the proof which is similar to that of Lemma 4.3.

Lemma 4.9 In the Kac-Moody superalgebra G = G(A, τ ), we have

               eij ekl = δ̂j−1,k eil if (i, j) ≥ (k, l), (i, k) 6= (m + n, m + n − 1),
               em+n,i em+n−1,i = 0 if i > n,
               em+n,i em+n−1,i−1 = em+n,i−1 em+n−1,i      if i ≤ n,
(4.16)
               {em+n,i em+n−1,j em+n−1,k } = 0 (i, j, k ∈ Ω),
               {em+n,i em+n−1,j em+n,k } = 0 (i, j, k ∈ Ω),
               (em+n,i em+n−1,j )(em+n,k em+n−1,l ) = 0 (i, j, k, l ∈ Ω).

   Let X = E ∪ H ∪ F = {ei , hi , fi | i ∈ Ω} be a Z2 -graded set, where Ω = {1, 2, · · · , n}
and τ = {1} ⊂ Ω is the set of odd index. Let R+ be the set of relations in E # given by:
       I. ei ej (i > j + 1, (i, j) 6= (m + n, m + n − 2)), em+n em+n−1 ,
      II. eij ei−1 (m + n > i > j), em+n,j em+n−2 (m + n − 2 ≥ j),
     III. eij ei,j−1 (i ≥ j > 1) with j ≤ m + n − 2 when i = m + n,
          em+n (em+n em+n−2 ),
     IV. em+n,i em+n−1,i (m + n − 2 ≥ i > n),

     VI. {em+n,i em+n−1,j em+n−1 } (i < j < m + n),
          {em+n,i em+n−1,i em+n−1 } (i ≤ n),
    VII. {em+n,i em+n,i em+n−1 } (m + n − 2 ≥ i),
   VIII. {em+n,i em+n−1,j em+n,i−1 } (1 < i < j < m + n),
          {em+n,i em+n−1,i em+n,i−1 } (i ≤ n),
     IX. (em+n,i em+n−1,j )(em+n,i em+n−1,j−1 ) (n + 1 < i + 1 < j < m + n),
          (em+n,i em+n−1,j )(em+n,i em+n−1,j ) (i ≤ n, i < j).
    Let R− be the set of relations in F # obtained by replacing eij ’s by fij ’s in R+ , and let
R(A, τ ) = R+ ∪ W ∪ R− . Consider the Lie superalgebra L = LX /hR(A, τ )i. Then there
is a surjective Lie superalgebra homomorphism ψ : L → G defined by ei 7→ ei , fi 7→ fi ,
hi 7→ hi (i ∈ Ω), and we have:

Theorem 4.10 The set R(A, τ ) of the relations in LX is a Gröbner-Shirshov basis for
the Lie superalgebra L.


                                                33
Proof. As in the case of C(n) = osp(2, 2n − 2), we only give a brief sketch of the proof
here. The set of R± -reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov monomials in LE (resp. LF ) is given
by

                B+ = {eij | i ≥ j} ∪ {em+n,i em+n−1,j | i < j or i = j ≤ n },
                B− = {fij | i ≥ j} ∪ {fm+n,i fm+n−1,j | i < j or i = j ≤ n }.

Hence the number of elements in the set of R(A, τ )-reduced super-Lyndon-Shirshov mono-
mials in LX is 2(m + n)2 − m + n, which is equal to the dimension of the Lie superalgebra
D(m, n) = osp(2m, 2n). Therefore, B is a linear basis of L and R(A, τ ) is a Gröbner-
Shirshov basis for L. 



Remark. The Lie superalgebras L, G(A, τ ), and D(m, n) = osp(2m, 2n) are all isomorphic
and R(A, τ ) is a minimal Gröbner-Shirshov basis.
