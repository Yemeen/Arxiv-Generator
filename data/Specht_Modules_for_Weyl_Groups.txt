                                            1     Introduction

                                            Over fields of characteristic zero, there are well known construction of the irreducible represen-
                                            tations and of irreducible modules, called Specht modules for the symmetric groups Sn which
                                            are based on elegant combinatorial concepts connected with Young tableaux etc.(see, e.g.[10]).
                                            James [8] extended these ideas to construct irreducible representations and modules over arbi-
                                            trary field. Al-Aamily, Morris and Peel [ 1 ] showed how this construction could be extended to
                                            deal with the Weyl groups of type Bn . In [11] the second author described a possible extension
                                            of James’ work for Weyl groups in general, where Young tableaux are interpreted in terms of
                                            root systems. We now modify these results and give an alternative generalisation of James’ work
                                            which is an improvement and extension of the original approach suggested by Morris.


                                            2     Some General Results On Weyl Groups

                                            In this section we establish the notation and state some results on Weyl groups which are required
                                            later . Standard references for this material are N Bourbaki [ 3 ] , R W Carter [ 4 ] and J E
                                            Humphreys [ 7 ] .
                                               Let Φ be a root system in an l-dimensional real space V and π be a simple system in Φ with
                                            corresponding positive system Φ+ and negative system Φ− .

                                                  W = W(Φ) =< τα | α ∈ Φ >

                                            be the W eyl group of Φ, where τα is the reflection corresponding to α. Let l(w) denote the
                                            length of w and the sign of w, s(w), is defined by s(w) = ( − 1 )l(w) , w ∈ W.
                                                We note the following facts which are requried later.


                                                                                            1
2.1 There are | W | simple systems (positive systems) in Φ given by wπ (wΦ+ ), w ∈ W. The
group W acts transitively on the set of simple systems.
2.2 Let Γ be the Dynkin diagram ( or Coxeter graph ) of Φ. A Weyl group is irreducible if
its Dynkin diagram is connected. Irreducible Weyl groups have been classified and correspond
to root systems of type Al (l ≥ 1), Bl (l ≥ 2), Cl (l ≥ 3), Dl (l ≥ 4), E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 , G2 . For
example W ( Al ) ∼  = Sl+1 , the symmetric group on the set {1, 2, ..., l + 1} . As our aim in this
paper is to generalise ideas from the symmetric groups, the root system and Dynkin diagram
are given in this case. The Dynkin diagram is

       1      2       3                   l-1         l
       ✐       ✐       ✐        . . .       ✐         ✐


and if { ǫ1 , ǫ2 , ... , ǫl+1 } is the standard basis for Rl+1 , then

      π = { α1 = ǫ1 − ǫ2 , α2 = ǫ2 − ǫ3 , ... , αl = ǫl − ǫl+1 }

      Φ = { ǫi − ǫj | 1 ≤ i , j ≤ l + 1}

      Φ+ = { ǫi − ǫj | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ l + 1}

2.3 A subsystem Ψ of Φ is a subset of Φ which is itself a root system in the space which it spans.
A subsystem Ψ is said to be additively closed if α , β ∈ Ψ , α + β ∈ Φ , then α + β ∈ Ψ .
From now on we assume that Ψ is additively closed subsystem of Φ. A W eyl subgroup W(Ψ)
of W corresponding to a subsystem Ψ is the subgroup of W generated by the τα , α ∈ Ψ.
2.4 The graphs which are Dynkin diagrams of subsystems of Φ may be obtained up to conjugacy
by a standard algorithm due independently to E B Dynkin, A Borel and J de Siebenthal (see
e.g. [ 4 ] ).
2.5 If w ∈ W and U is the subspace of V composed of all vectors fixed by w, then w is a product
of reflections corresponding to roots in the orthogonal complement U ⊥ of U . [ 4 ]
2.6 The simple system J of Ψ can always be chosen such that J ⊂ Φ+ . [12]
2.7 The set DΨ = {w ∈ W | w(j) ∈ Φ+ f or all j ∈ J } is a distinguished set of coset
representatives of W(Ψ) in W , that is, each element w ∈ W has unique expression of the form
dΨ wΨ , where dΨ ∈ DΨ and wΨ ∈ W(Ψ) and furthermore dΨ is the element of minimal length
in the coset dΨ W(Ψ). [12]
2.8 We now extend the above to cover some further reflection subgroups of Weyl groups. This
work is due to Steinberg and we follow the description given by Carter [5] where the results
highlighted below are proved.

                                                  2
Let ρ be a non-trivial symmetry of the Dynkin diagram of Φ. Then there is a unique isometry τ
of V such that τ (r) is a positive multiple of ρ ( r ) = r̄ for all simple roots r ∈ π. The isometry
τ satisfies the conditions :

      τ (r) = r̄          if all the roots of Φ have same length

                   √1    r̄   if r is short
      τ (r) = { √2                             f or Φ = B2 or F4
                        2 r̄ if r is long

                   √1    r̄   if r is short
      τ (r) = { √3                             f or Φ = G2
                        3 r̄ if r is long

  Clearly the order of τ as an isometry of V is equal to the order of ρ as a permutation of π.
Now let
   V 1 = {v ∈ V | τ (v) = v}
For each v ∈ V let v 1 denote the projection of v onto the subspace V 1 . Then v 1 is the average
of the vectors in the orbit of v under τ .
   Since τ (r) is a positive multiple of ρ ( r ) for all r ∈ π we have
   τ wr τ −1 = wρ         ( r )   ,   where r ∈ π
   Let
   W 1 = {w ∈ W | τ w τ −1 = w }
then W 1 operates faithfully on V 1 . Let J be an orbit of π under ρ . Let W(J) be the subgroup
of W generated by the elements τr for r ∈ J . Let w0J be the element of W(J) which transforms
every positive root in ΦJ into a negative root. Then w0J ∈ W 1 and W 1 is generated by the
elements w0J for the different ρ-orbits of π. Since w0J coincides with wr1 on V 1 for each root
r ∈ J the elements w0J are reflections when restricted to V 1 . Then the reflections wr1 of V 1 ,
for all r ∈ π , generate the group W 1 of isometries of V 1 . Let Φ1 = {r 1 ∈ V 1 | r ∈ Φ} and
π 1 = {r 1 ∈ V 1 | r ∈ π}. The sets w (Φ+
                                        J ) form a partition of Φ as w runs through the elements
       1
of W and J runs through the ρ-orbits of π . The roots r and s are in the same set if and only
if r 1 is a positive multiple of s1 .
    The sets Φ1 and π 1 almost act as a root system and simple system for W 1 acting on V 1 ,
since
(i) Φ1 spans V 1 ,
(ii) Every element of Φ1 is a linear combination of elements of π 1 with coefficients all non-
negative or all non-positive ,
(iii) A basis of V 1 may be obtained by picking one element of π 1 out of each set of positive

                                                       3
multiples ,
(iv) If r 1 ∈ Φ1 then there is an element of W 1 which coincides with wr1 on V 1 ,
(v) If r 1 , s1 ∈ Φ1 then wr1 (s1 ) ∈ Φ1 .
The groups W 1 will be referred to as Steinberg subgroups from now on.

                                                                                          r

let Ji be a simple system in Ψi (i = 1, 2, ..., s) and J =                 Ji . Let Ψ         be the largest subsystem
                                                                     i=1

in Φ orthogonal to Ψ and let J             ⊂ Φ+ the simple system of Ψ               .
   Let J¯ stand for the ordered set {J1 , J2 , ..., Jr ; J1 , J2 , ..., Js } , where in addition the elements
                                                             ′   ′          ′

                 ′
in each Ji and Ji are ordered. Let

         TJ,J ′ = {wJ¯ | w ∈ W}

   Now , we consider under what conditions the elements in the set TJ,J ′ are distinct. We obtain
the following lemma.
                                                                      ′⊥
Lemma 3.1 | TJ,J ′ |=| W | if and only if W(J ⊥ ) ∩ W(J ) =< e > .

Proof Suppose that w1 J¯ = w2 J¯ , where w1 , w2 ∈ W . Then w1 J = w2 J , w1 J = w2 J and
                                                                                    ′        ′

                                                  ′
since the elements of each component of J and J are also ordered it follows that w2−1 w1 (α) = α
                                               ′                                               ′⊥
for all α ∈ J and w2−1 w1 (α) = α for all α ∈ J , that is , by ( 2.5 ) w2−1 w1 ∈ W(J ⊥ ) ∩ W(J ).
                                                                                   ′⊥
Thus we have that the elements of TJ,J ′ are distinct if and only if W(J ⊥ ) ∩ W(J ) =< e >.
    Now we can give our principal definition .
                                  ′                                                                      ′
Definition 3.2 Let Ψ and Ψ be subsystems of Φ with simple systems J and J respectively
           ′                      ′                     ′
such that Ψ ⊆ Φ \ Ψ and J ⊂ Φ+ , J ⊂ Φ+ . The pair {J, J } is called a usef ul system in Φ if

                                                         4
               ′                                 ′⊥
W(J) ∩ W(J ) =< e > and W(J ⊥ ) ∩ W(J ) =< e >.
                      ′                                               ′
Remark 1 If {J, J } is a useful system in Φ , then {wJ, wJ } is also a useful system in Φ, for
w ∈ W. Thus , from now on TJ,J ′ will be denoted by T∆ .
                      ′                                           ′                    ′⊥
Remark 2 If {J, J } is a useful system in Φ then Ψ ∩ Ψ = ∅ and Ψ⊥ ∩ Ψ                       = ∅ However the
converse is not true in general.
                              ′
Definition 3.3 Let {J, J } be a useful system in Φ . Then the elements of T∆ are called
                         ′                                            ′
∆ − tableaux, the J and J are called the rows and the columns of {J, J } respectively.
    We see that this is a natural extension of the concept of a Young tableaux in the representation
theory of symmetric groups . In the case Al , the subsystems are given up to conjugacy by root
systems of type Al1 + ... + Als , where the li ≥ 0 and (li + 1 ) = l + 1 Thus the corresponding
                                                           P

Weyl subgroup is W (Al1 ) × ... × W ( Als ) which is isomorphic to the Young subgroup
Sl1 +1 × ... × Sls +1 of Sl+1 and there is a Weyl subgroup corresponding to each partition of
l + 1 . If Ψ = Al1 + ... + Als is a subsystem of Al , then λ = (l1 +1 , ... , ls +1) is a partition of
l+1 . If we put ki = l1 +...+li +i (i = 1, 2, ..., s) and k0 = 0 then {ǫki−1 +1 −ǫki−1 +2 , ..., ǫki −1 −ǫki }
is a simple system for Ali . This may be represented by the λ-tableau

the other n! λ− tableau being obtained by allowing the elements of Sn to act on this λ− tableau.
    The orthogonal subsystem Ψ⊥ is the root system determined by the elements in rows of length
one in the λ − tableau . The ordering of the rows is important , for example the 32 − tableaux
123 and 456 are regarded as distinct tableaux.

Definition 3.4 Two ∆-tableaux J¯ and K̄ are row − equivalent , written J¯ ∼ K̄ , if there
exists w ∈ W(J) such that K̄ = w J.¯ The equivalence class which contains the ∆-tableau J¯
    ¯ and is called a ∆ − tabloid.
is {J}
  Let τ∆ be the set of all ∆-tabloids . It is clear that the number of distinct elements in τ∆ is
[W : W(J)] and by ( 2.7 ) we have

      τ∆ = {{ dJ¯ } | d ∈ DΨ }
                            ′                     ′
We note that if J¯ = { J ; J } then dJ ⊂ Φ+ but dJ need not be a subset of Φ+ .
   We now give an example to illustrate the construction of a ∆-tabloid. In this example and
later examples we use the following notation. If π = {α1 , α2 , ..., αn } is a simple system in Φ

and α ∈ Φ, then α =                ai αi , where ai ∈ Z. From now on α is denoted by a1 a2 ...an and
                             i=1
τα1 , τα2 , ..., ταn are denoted by τ1 , τ2 , ..., τn respectively.
Example 3.5 Let Φ = A3 with simple system π = {α1 = ǫ1 − ǫ2 , α2 = ǫ2 − ǫ3 , α3 = ǫ3 − ǫ4 }.

   The group W acts on τ∆ according to

      σ {wJ } = {σwJ }             f or all σ ∈ W.

This action is well defined , for if {w1 J} = {w2 J} , then there exists ρ ∈ W(w1 J) such that
ρw1 J = w2 J . Hence since σρσ −1 ∈ W(σw1 J) and σw2 J = σρw1 J = (σρσ −1 )(σw1 J) , we have
{σw1 J} = {σw2 J} .
   Now if K is arbitrary field , let M ∆ be the K-space whose basis elements are the ∆-tabloids.
Extend the action of W on τ∆ linearly on M ∆ , then M ∆ becomes a KW-module. Then we
have the following lemma.
Lemma 3.6 The KW-module M ∆ is a cyclic KW-module generated by any one tabloid and
dimK M ∆ = [W : W(J)]
   Now we proceed to consider the possibility of constructing a KW-module which corresponds
to the Specht module in the case of symmetric groups. In order to do this we need to define a
∆-polytabloid .

Definition 3.7 Let {J, J } be a useful system in Φ . Let

                                                       and eJ,J ′ = κJ ′ { J¯ }

                   σ ∈ W(J )


where s is the sign function defined in Section 2 . Then eJ,J ′ is called the generalized ∆ −
polytabloid associated with J.
  If w ∈ W(Φ) , then
                           X
     w κJ ′        =                        s(σ)wσ

Hence, for all w ∈ W(Φ), we have

    Let S J,J be the subspace of M ∆ generated by ewJ,wJ ′ where w ∈ W. Then by (3.1) S J,J
is a KW-submodule of M ∆ , which is called a generalized Specht module. Then we have the

Then by ( 3.1 ) we have w ( eJ,J ′ ) = ewJ,wJ ′ ∈ S wJ,wJ . Clearly Tw is an isomorphism. The
statements (ii) , (iii) follow easily from (i).

Lemma 3.10 Let {J, J } be a useful system in Φ . Then S ∆,∆ is generated by edJ,dJ ′ , where

Proof If w ∈ W, then by (2.7), w = dρ, where d ∈ DΨ′ and ρ ∈ W(J ) and since

d = σw−1 = σ w     and σ σ = w w ∈ W(J) ∩ W(J ) = < e > . Hence we have w = w

Proof By Lemma 3.11 if {σJ } appears in eJ,J ′ then all the {σJ } are different, where σ ∈ W(J ).
                      ′
But { {σJ } | σ ∈ W(J ) } is a linearly independent subset of { {d J } | d ∈ DΨ }. If eJ,J ′ = 0
                                         ′
then s(σ) = (−1)l(σ) = 0 for all σ ∈ W(J ) . This is a contradiction and so eJ,J ′ 6= 0.
Remark 3 In [ 11 ] the second author has defined a partial dual of a subsystem Ψ simply as
                 ′
a subsystem Ψ of Φ which is contained in Φ \ Ψ . However the following lemma shows that
                                  ′
the extra condition W(J) ∩ W(J ) =< e > in our definition of a useful system is also necessary.
Unfortunately this condition which is a group theoretical one is not easily checked and it would
be useful if it could be replaced by a criteria in terms of the root system only.

Lemma 3.16 Let {J, J } be a useful system in Φ and let d ∈ DΨ . Then the following conditions
are equivalent:
(i) { dJ } appears with non-zero coefficient in eJ,J ′
                          ′
(ii) There exists σ ∈ W(J ) such that σ{ J¯ } = {dJ }
                                          ′
(iii) There exists ρ ∈ W(J) and σ ∈ W(J ) such that d = σ ρ

                                                                                   9
Proof The equivalence of (i) and (ii) follows directly from the formula

                                       ¯
                  X
     eJ,J ′ =               s ( σ ) σ {J}
                        ′
                σ ∈ W(J )


(ii) ⇒ (iii) Suppose that there exists σ ∈ W(J ) such that σ{ J¯ } = {dJ }. Then we
                                                             ′


have σ −1 d{ J¯ } = {J¯ }. By the definition of equivalence there exists ρ ∈ W(J) such that
                                                  ′⊥             ′
σ −1 d J¯ = ρ J¯ . Then ρ−1 σ −1 d ∈ W(J ⊥ ) ∩ W(J ). Since {J, J } is a useful system in Φ then
                          ′
d = σ ρ , where σ ∈ W(J ) and ρ ∈ W(J).
                                            ′
(iii) ⇒ (ii) Let d = σ ρ, where σ ∈ W(J ) and ρ ∈ W(J). Since ρ ∈ W(J), ρ J¯ = J¯ then
{dJ } = {σρJ } = {σJ }.
                            ′
Lemma 3.17 Let {J, J } be a useful system in Φ and let d ∈ DΨ . If { dJ } appears in eJ,J ′
            ′
then d Ψ ∩ Ψ = ∅.
                                                                                               ′
Proof Let α ∈ d Ψ. If { dJ } appears in eJ,J ′ then by Lemma 3.16 d = σ ρ, where σ ∈ W(J )
                                                                                     ′
and ρ ∈ W(J). Then α ∈ σρΨ. Since ρ ∈ W(J), then α ∈ σΨ and σ −1 α ∈ Ψ. But Ψ ∩ Ψ = ∅,
                ′               ′     ′       ′           ′
then σ −1 α 6∈ Ψ . Since σ ∈ W(J ), σΨ = Ψ then α 6∈ Ψ .
                            ′
Lemma 3.18 Let {J, J } be a useful system in Φ and let d ∈ DΨ . Let
       ′
d Ψ ∩ Ψ 6= ∅. Then κJ ′ { dJ } = 0.
                    ′                               ′                     ′
Proof If d Ψ ∩ Ψ 6= ∅ then let α ∈ d Ψ ∩ Ψ and so τα ∈ W(dJ) ∩ W(J ). Thus

     ( e − τα ) {dJ } = {dJ } − {dJ } = 0
                                            ′
Since { e , τα } is a subgroup of W(J ) then we can select signed coset representatives σ1 , σ2 ,
                                   ′
σ3 , ... , σs for { e , τα } in W(J ) such that

                            s
                            X
     κJ ′ { dJ } = (            σi ) ( e − τα ) {d J} = 0 .
                        i = 1


   The converse of Lemma 3.17 is not true in general, which leads to the following definition .

Definition 3.19 A useful system {J, J } in Φ is called a good system if
       ′
d Ψ ∩ Ψ = ∅ for d ∈ DΨ then { dJ } appears with non-zero coefficient in eJ,J ′ .
                            ′
Lemma 3.20 Let {J, J } be a good system in Φ and let d ∈ DΨ .
(i) If {dJ } does not appear in eJ,J ′ then κJ ′ { dJ } = 0.
                                                           ′
(ii) If {dJ } appears in eJ,J ′ then there exists σ ∈ W(J ) such that

     κJ ′ { dJ } = s ( σ ) eJ,J ′

                                                        10
                                                                                                     ′
Proof (i) If {dJ } does not appear in eJ,J ′ then by definition of a good system we have d Ψ∩Ψ 6= ∅
and hence by Lemma 3.17 we have κJ ′ { dJ } = 0.
                                                                                         ′
(ii) Since {dJ } appears in eJ,J ′ it follows by Lemma 3.16 that there exists σ ∈ W(J ) such that
σ{J¯} = {dJ }. Then we have
                              X
         κJ ′ { dJ } = (                    s(ρ) ρ) {σ J} = s(σ)eJ,J ′ .
                                       ′
                            ρ∈W(J )

Corollary 3.21 Let {J, J } be a good system in Φ. If m ∈ M ∆ then κJ ′ m is a multiple of eJ,J ′ .
Proof If m ∈ M ∆ then we have
                       X
             m =                αd { dJ } , where αd ∈ K
                      d ∈ DΨ
                       X
         κJ ′ m =               αd κJ ′ { dJ }
                      d ∈ DΨ


But by Lemma 3.20 κJ ′ m = λ eJ,J ′ , where λ ∈ K.
   We now define a bilinear form < , > on M ∆ by setting
                                              1       if {J¯1 } = {J¯2 }
         < {J¯1 } , {J¯2 } > = {              0       otherwise

This is a symmetric, non-singular, W-invariant bilinear form on M ∆ .
   Now we can prove James’ submodule theorem in this general setting.

Theorem 3.22 Let {J, J } be a good system in Φ. Let U be submodule of M ∆ . Then either

Proof If u ∈ U then

                               = < κJ ′ u , { J¯ } >

But by Corollary 3.21 κJ ′ u = λ eJ,J ′ , for some λ ∈ K. If λ 6= 0 for some u ∈ U , then
                                ′
eJ,J ′ ∈ U , that is , S ∆,∆ ⊆ U . However , if λ = 0 for all u ∈ U , then < u , eJ,J ′ > = 0 ,
                       ′⊥
that is , U ⊆ S ∆,∆ .

                                                                      11
   We can now prove our principal result.

Theorem 3.23 Let {J, J } be a good system in Φ . The KW-module
        ′           ′        ′        ′⊥
D ∆,∆ = S ∆,∆ / S ∆,∆ ∩ S ∆,∆              is zero or irreducible.
                                           ′
Proof If U is a submodule of S ∆,∆ then U is a submodule of M ∆ and by Theorem 3.22 either

S ∆,∆ ⊆ U in which case U = S ∆,∆ or U ⊆ S ∆,∆                       and U ⊆ S ∆,∆        ∩ S ∆,∆        , which
completes the proof.
   In the case of K = Q or any field of characteristic zero < , > is an inner product and
     ′          ′                                                    ′
D ∆,∆   = S ∆,∆ . Thus if for a subsystem Ψ of Φ a good system {J, J } can be found , then
we have a construction for irreducible KW-modules . Hence it is essential to show for each
subsystem that a good system exists which satisfies Definition 3.19.
   In the following example, we show how a good system may be constructed in most cases for the
Weyl group of type D4 . In a future publication, we shall present an algorithm for constructing a
good system for certain subsystems; indeed this algorithm will give a good system with additional
                                                                                         ′
properties which will lead to the construction of a K-basis for our Specht modules S ∆,∆ , which
correspond to the basis consisting of standard tableaux in the case of symmetric groups.

been obtained. We now show how an additional irreducible character is obtained. Let Ψ2 = A1

Since Ψ2 ⊂ Ψ1 , by Lemma 3.15 S ∆1 ,∆1 is a KW-submodule of S ∆1 ,∆2 . By a similar calculation
                                                                                        ′        ′
to the above it can be showed that the corresponding character of W afforded by S ∆1 ,∆2 /S ∆1 ,∆1
is χ11 .
    In fact, we have a ’Specht series’ corresponding to series

       ∅ ⊂ {1101} ⊂ {1101, 0111}

Unfortunately, no further irreducible character of W(D4 ) are obtained by similar calculations
for the other subsystems.
    We see that not all the irreducible modules for W(D4 ) are obtained in this way. That is,
there are not a sufficient supply of subsystems or Weyl subgroups to give a complete set of
irreducible modules. In the next section, it will be shown that the irreducible character χ10 , χ12
of degree 4 and 6 respectively can be obtained by considering W(B3 ) and W(G2 ) as Steinberg
subgroups of W(D4 ).


4     Additional Specht Modules for Weyl Groups

In this section we consider our groups as reflection groups and thus, include reflection subgroups
these groups. We modify the algorithm for determining subsystems of Φ in ( 2.4 ) so as to
include Steinberg subgroups of the type described in ( 2.8 ). Detailed proofs are not always
included as they are either modifications of those in Section 3 or in the earlier paper [ 11 ]. In


                                                      15
this case, it is necessary to express our results in terms of the subgroups rather than the root
subsystems as in Section 3.
Algorithm 4.1
(i) Form the extended Dynkin diagram of Φ . This is obtained by adding one further node to the
graph of Φ corresponding to the negative of the highest root ,
(ii) Delete one or more nodes in all possible ways from the extended Dynkin diagram,
(iii) Let ρ be a symmetry of the remaining Dynkin diagram. Then follow (2.8) to form a Steinberg
subgroup for this remaining Dynkin diagram ,
(iv) Take also the duals of the diagrams obtained in the same way from the dual system Φ̃ which
is obtained from by interchancing long and short roots,
(v) Repeat the process with the Dynkin diagram obtained and continue any number of times.
Definition 4.2 An extended subsystem Ψ is the root system corresponding to the Dynkin
diagram obtained by Algorithm 4.1.
    Let Ψ be an extended subsystem of Φ with simple system J and Dynkin diagram ∆. By
Algorithm 4.1 we have
(i) If the symmetry ρ is the identity, then W(J) is a Weyl subgroup of W(Φ).
(ii) If ρ is a non-trivial symmetry, then W(J) is a Steinberg subgroup of W(Φ).
Definition 4.3 If Ψ is an extended subsystem of Φ, then the reflection subgroup W(J) of W
which is generated by the τα , α ∈ Ψ is called a Steinberg − W eyl (SW) − subgroup of W.
   We now define equivalence relation on the elements of W.
       ′                                ′                       ′
     w ∼w       if and only if         w w−1 ∈ W(J) f or w , w ∈ W(Φ)

Definition 4.4 Let w ∈ W . The equivalence class

                           ′       ′
     { w W(J) } = { w | w ∼ w}

is called a ∆ − tabloid.
   Let τ∆ be the set of all ∆-tabloids. In this new setting it is clear that the elements of τ∆
are the left coset representatives of W(J) in W and the number of distinct elements in τ∆ is
[W : W(J)].
   The group W acts on τ∆ according to
       ′                       ′                      ′
     w { w W(J) } = {w w W(J) }               f or all w ∈ W.


   This action is again easily seen to be well defined .

                                                 16
   Now if K is arbitrary field , let M ∆ be the K-space whose basis elements are ∆ -tabloids.
Extend the action of W on τ∆ linearly on M ∆ , then M ∆ becomes KW-module. Then we have
the following theorem.
Theorem 4.5 The KW-module M ∆ is the permutation module on the SW-subgroup W(J) M ∆
is a cyclic KW-module generated by any one tabloid and dimK M ∆ = [ W : W(J) ].
                                                                                           ′
   Now we can consider the possibility of constructing a KW-module S J,J which generalises
the Specht modules described in Section 3. In this direction we first define a useful dual of a
SW-subgroup W(J).
                                                                                   ′
Definition 4.6 A usef ul dual of W(J) is a SW-subgroup W(J ) of W(Φ) which satisfies
            ′
W(J) ∩ W(J ) =< e >
Then we have the following lemma.

all w ∈ W(J).

where s is the sign function defined in Section 2.Then eJ,J ′ is called a generalized ∆ −polytabloid.

   Let S J,J be the subspace of M ∆ spanned by all the generalized ∆-polytabloids ewJ,wJ ′ ,

w ∈ W. By the same method as in Section 3, S J,J is a KW-submodule of M ∆ , which is called
a generalized Specht module.

Lemma 4.14 If w ∈ W and W(J ) is a useful dual of W(J), then the following conditions are
equivalent:

have σ −1 w{W(J)} = {W(J)}. By the definition of equivalence, σ −1 w ∈ W(J) and there exists
                                                             ′
ρ ∈ W(J) such that σ −1 w = ρ. Hence w = σρ , where σ ∈ W(J ) and ρ ∈ W(J).
(iii) ⇒ (ii) If w = σρ, then since ρ ∈ W(J), ρ{W(J)} = {W(J)} and {wW(J)} = {σW(J)}.

Definition 4.15 A useful dual W(J ) of W(J) is called a good dual of W(J) if κJ ′ {wW(J)} =
                                                                                          6 0,
then {wW(J)} appears in eJ,J ′ .
                                      ′
Lemma 4.16 Let W(J ) be a good dual of W(J) .
(i) If {wW(J)} does not appear in eJ,J ′ then κJ ′ {wW(J)} = 0.
                                                           ′
(ii) If {wW(J)} appears in eJ,J ′ then there exists σ ∈ W(J ) such that

        κJ ′ { w W(J) } = s ( σ ) eJ,J ′

Proof See Lemma 3.20
Corollary 4.17If m ∈ M ∆ then κJ ′ m is a multiple of eJ,J ′ .
  We now define a bilinear form < , > on M ∆ by setting
                                                       (
                                                             1 if w1 = w2
        < {w1 W(J)}, {w2 W(J)} >=
                                                             0 otherwise

This is a symmetric, non-singular, W-invariant, bilinear form on M ∆ .
  Now the analogue of James’ submodule theorem can be proved in this more general setting.
Theorem 4.18 Let U be submodule of M ∆ . Then either
    ′                            ′⊥                     ′⊥                        ′
S J,J ⊆ U or U ⊆ S J,J                    where S J,J        is complement of S J,J in M ∆ .
  We can now prove our principal result.

                                                                    18

Theorem 4.19 The KW-module D J = S J,J / S J,J ∩ S J,J                                    is zero or irreducible.
Proof See Theorem 3.23
  Now to illustrate the above we show how a complete system of irreducible modules is deter-
mined in the case Φ = D4 .
Example 4.20 Let Φ = D4 with π = {α1 = ǫ1 − ǫ2 , α2 = ǫ2 − ǫ3 , α3 = ǫ3 − ǫ4 , α4 = ǫ3 + ǫ4 }
and let Ψ1 = A3 be the extended subsystem of D4 with simple system J1 = {1000, 0100, 0010}.
        ′                                                                      ′
Let Ψ1 = 2A1 be the extended subsystem of D4 with simple system J1 = {1101, 0111}.Since
                  ′                           ′
W(J1 ) ∩ W(J1 ) =< e >, then W(J1 ) is a useful dual of W(J1 ). Then τ∆1 contains the ∆1 -
tabloids {W(J1 )},{τ4 W(J1 )}, {τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}, {τ1 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}, {τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}, {τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )},
{τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}, {τ4 τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}.
    For w = e, τ1 τ2 τ4 , τ3 τ2 τ4 , τ4 τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 , we have κJ ′ {wW(J1 )} =
                                                                                6 0. Since
                                                                             1


        eJ1 ,J ′ = {W(J1 )} − {τ1 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} + {τ4 τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}
              1

              ′
then W(J1 ) is a good dual of W(J1 ).
   Now let K be a field with CharK=0. Let M ∆1 be K-space whose basis elements are the
                         ′
∆1 -tabloids. Let S J1 ,J1 be the corresponding KW-submodule of M ∆1 , then by definition of the
Specht module we have
                  ′
        S J1 ,J1 = Sp { eJ1 ,J ′ , eτ4 J1 ,τ4 J ′ , eτ2 τ4 J1 ,τ2 τ4 J ′ }

where
   eJ1 ,J ′               = {W(J1 )} − {τ1 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} + {τ4 τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}

   eτ4 J1 ,τ4 J ′         = {τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ1 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} + {τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}

   eτ2 τ4 J1 ,τ2 τ4 J ′   = {τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ1 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} + {τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}

                                                                                     ′
   Let T1 be the matrix representation of W afforded by S J1 ,J1 with character ψ1 and let τ2 be
the representative of the conjugate class C2 . Then
    τ2 (eJ1 ,J ′ )            ={W(J1 )} − {τ1 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} + {τ4 τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}
               1
                              =eJ1 ,J ′
                                      1
    τ2 (eτ4 J1 ,τ4 J ′ )      ={τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ1 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} + {τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}
                    1
                              =eτ2 τ4 J1 ,τ2 τ4 J ′
                                                 1
    τ2 (eτ2 τ4 J1 ,τ2 τ4 J ′ )={τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ1 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} − {τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )} + {τ2 τ1 τ3 τ2 τ4 W(J1 )}
                          1
                              =eτ4 J1 ,τ4 J ′
                                       1

    Thus we have

                                                                    19

                         
                    0 1 0
   By a similar calculation to the above it can be showed that ψ1 = χ4 . By the same method
to the above, in addition to the irreducible modules in Example 3.24 we have,
                                                      ′        ′

       G2         {0100, 31 (1000 + 0010 + 0001)}   A2     {0001, 0110}       χ12

   We note that the irreducible modules corresponding to the characters χ10 , χ11 have not been
obtained. We now show how additional irreducible characters are obtained.
            ′                                                                  ′                         ′
      Let Ψ2 = A1 be the extended subsystem of Φ with simple system J2 = {1101}. Then W(J2 )
                                             ′                            ′                          ′
is a useful dual of W(J1 ). Since W(J2 ) is a SW-subgroup of W(J1 ), by Lemma 4.13 S            J1 ,J1
                                                                                                is
                              ′
a KW-submodule of S    J 1 ,J 2 . By a similar calculation to the above it can be showed that the
                                                   ′       ′
corresponding character of W afforded by S J1 ,J2 /S J1 ,J1 is χ11 .

    Let Ψ2 = A1 be the extended subsystem of Φ with simple system J2 = {1000}. Let Ψ1 = B3
                                                              ′
be the extended subsystem of Φ with simple system J1 = {0100, 0001, 21 (1000 + 1211)} and

Then W(J2 ) is a useful dual of W(J2 ) and W(J1 ) is a good dual of W(J1 ). Since W(J2 ) is
                               ′                      ′                              ′
a SW-subgroup of W(J1 ), by Lemma 4.13 S J2 ,J1 is a KW-submodule of S J2 ,J2 . By a similar
calculation to the above it can be showed that the corresponding character of W afforded by
       ′          ′
S J2 ,J2 /S J2 ,J1 is χ10 . Thus we have obtained a complete set of irreducible modules for D4 .
