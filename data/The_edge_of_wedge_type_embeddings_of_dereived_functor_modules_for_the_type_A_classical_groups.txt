                                                       A holomorphic discrete series can be realized as the space of the holomorphic sections
                                                   of a homogeneous vector bundle on a bounded symmetric domain. We can embed it into a
                                                   degenerate principal series realized as the space of hyperfunction sections of a vector bundle
                                                   on the Shilov boundary by taking the boundary value. We consider an algebraic version
                                                   of higher cohomological analogue of such an embedding for complex reductive groups and

                                             § 0.       Introduction
                                             Let G be a real linear reductive Lie group and let GC its complexification. We denote by g0
                                             (resp. g) the Lie algebra of G (resp. GC ) and denote by σ the complex conjugation on g with
                                             respect to g0 . We fix a maximal compact subgroup K of G and denote by θ the corresponding
                                             Cartan involution. We denote by k the complexified Lie algebra of K.
                                                 We fix a parabolic subgroup P of G with a θ-stable Levi part M . We denote by N the
                                             nilradical of P . We denote by p, m, and n the complexified Lie algebras of P , M , and N ,
                                             respectively. We denote by PC , MC , and NC the analytic subgroups in GC corresponding to p,
                                             m, and n, respectively.
                                                 For X ∈ m, we define
                                                                                          1
                                                                                  δ(X) = tr (adg(X)|n) .
                                                                                          2
                                             Then, δ is a one-dimensional representation of m. We see that 2δ lifts to a holomorphic group
                                             homomorphism ξ2δ : MC → C× . Defining ξ2δ |NC trivial, we may extend ξ2δ to PC . We put
                                             X = GC /PC . Let L be the holomorphic line bundle on X corresponding to the canonical
                                             divisor. Namely, L is the GC -homogeneous line bundle on X associated to the character ξ2δ on
                                             PC . We denote the restriction of ξ2δ to P by the same letter.

                                                                                                 1
     For a character η : P → C× , we consider the unnormalized parabolic induction u IndG    P (η).
          u   G                                                 ∞
Namely, IndP (η) is the K-finite part of the space of the C -sections of the G-homogeneous
line bundle on G/P associated to η. u IndG  P (η) is a Harish-Chandra (g, K)-module.
     If G/P is orientable, then the trivial G-representation is the unique irreducible quotient of
u IndG (ξ ). If G/P is not orientable, there is a character ω on P such that ω is trivial on the
      P 2δ
identical component of P and the trivial G-representation is the unique irreducible quotient of
u IndG (ξ ⊗ ω).
      P 2δ
     Let O be an open G-orbit on X. We put the following assumption:
     Assumption A There is a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra q of g such that q ∈ O.
     Under the above assumption, q has a Levi decomposition q = l + u such that l is a θ and
σ-stable Levi part. In fact l is unique, since we have l = σ(q) ∩ q.
     For each open G-orbit O on X, we put

                                  AO = Hdim u∩k(O, L)K-finite .

From [Wong 1993], AO is a derived functor module. Namely, in the terminology in [Vogan-
Zuckerman 1984], we have AO = Aq = Aq(0).
    If G is of the Hermitian type and P is a Siegel parabolic subgroup of G, there are two open
G-orbits in X isomorphic to G/K. (the Siegel upper and lower half planes.) For such orbits,
AO are representations in holomorphic or anti-holomorphic discrete series. In this case, we can
embed AO into u IndG P (ξ2δ ) by taking boundary values at the Shilov boundary.
    We consider the other orbits. Then, the corresponding embedding should be a higher coho-
mological analogy of boundary value maps. Here, we discuss examples.
    Example 1.       Let n be an integer such that n > 3. Let G be SO0 (n, 1) and let P be
its minimal parabolic subgroup. Then X = GC /PC has two G-orbits. One is a closed orbit
XR = G/P and the other is an open orbit (say O). In this case, Assumption A holds and we
have O ∼ = G/(SO(2) × SO0 (n − 2, 1)). Since O = X − XR , we have the following long exact
sequence of cohomologies:
                                          n−1
           H n−2 (X, L) → H n−2 (O, L) → HX R
                                              (X, L) → H n−1 (X, L) → H n−1 (O, L).

Taking account of n−1 = dim X, we see H n−2 (X, L) = 0 and H n−1 (X, L) = C from the general-
ized Borel-Weil-Bott theorem [Kostant 1961]. From [Wong 1993], we have H n−2 (O, L)K-finite =
AO and H n−1 (O, L) = 0. Since XR is an n − 1-dimensional sphere, XR is orientable. Hence
   n−1
HX  R
       (X, L) is nothing but the space of hyperfunction sections of the principal series representa-
tion of G with respect to L. (cf. [Kashiwara-Kawai-Kimura 1986]) Hence, taking K-finite parts,
we have the following short exact sequence.

                                0 → AO → u IndG
                                              P (ξ2δ ) → C → 0.

Hence, the structure of u IndG
                             P (ξ2δ ) is understood geometrically in this case.
   Example 2.      Let n > 3. Let G = SO0 (n, 2) and P be a parabolic subgroup with the
semisimple part of the Levi part is isomorphic to SO0 (n − 1, 1). In this case X = GC /PC
has three open G-orbits. Two of them (say O+ and O− ) are Hermitian symmetric spaces
(symmetric domains of type IV). The remaining one (say O0 )is non-Stein and isomorphic to
G/(SO(2) × SO0 (n − 2, 2)). Let O+ and O− be the closures of O+ and O− , respectively. In this



                                                 2
case, we have (X − O+ ) ∩ (X − O− ) = O0 and (X − O+ ) ∪ (X − O− ) = X − XR . Here, we put
XR = G/P . Hence, we have the following Mayer-Vietris exact sequence:

       H 2n−2 (X − O+ , L) ⊕ H 2n−2 (X − O− , L) → H 2n−2 (O0 , L) → H 2n−1 (X − XR , L).

We also have the following exact sequences.

                      H 2n−2 (X, L) → H 2n−2 (X − O+ , L) → HO
                                                             2n−1
                                                                  (X, L),
                                                                   +
                                                             2n−1
                      H 2n−2 (X, L) → H 2n−2 (X − O− , L) → HO    (X, L).
                                                                   −


From [Kostant 1961], we have H 2n−2 (X, L) = 0. We can regard O+ and O− as closed convex
sets in an open cell of X. (Namely, we realize O+ and O− as bounded symmetric domains.)
Hence, from the edge-of-wedge theorem (see [Kashiwara-Laurent 1983] Théorème 1.1.2), we have
  2n−1             2n−1
HO     (X, L) = HO      (X, L) = 0. Hence, H 2n−2 (X − O+ , L) = H 2n−2 (X − O− , L) = 0. We
    +               −
also have the following exact sequence.

                     0 = H 2n−1 (X, L) → H 2n−1 (X − XR , L) → HX
                                                                2n
                                                                  R
                                                                    (X, L).

Hence, we have
                      H 2n−2 (O0 , L) ֒→ H 2n−1 (X − XR , L) ֒→ HX
                                                                 2n
                                                                   R
                                                                     (X, L).
In this case XR is orientable if and only if n is even. Hence, the local cohomology HX  2n (x, L)
                                                                                         R
is the space of hyperfunction sections of the degenerate principal series of G with respect to L
(resp. L ⊗ ω) if n is even (resp. odd). Taking K-finite part, we have

                                  AO0 ֒→ u IndG
                                              P (ξ2δ ) (if n is even),
                              AO0 ֒→ u IndG
                                          P (ξ2δ ⊗ ω) (if n is odd).

    Such an easy construction of an embedding seems to be difficult to obtain in the general cases.
However, [Matumoto 1988],[Kashiwara-Schapira 1990], [Sahi-Stein 1992], [Gindikin 1993], etc.
give some evidences of the existence of the edge-of-wedge type embeddings as above in more
general settings. In this article, we consider the following problem in the setting of Harish-
Chandra modules:
    Problem B Let G be a real linear reductive Lie group and let P be its parabolic subgroup.
Let O be an open G-orbit in X = GC /PC satisfying Assumption A. Does there exist a character
χ of P trivial on the identity component such that AO ֒→ u IndG  P (ξ2δ ⊗ χ)?
    If the nilradical of P is commutative, the answer is known more or less by [Sahi 1992],
[Sahi-Stein 1990], [Sahi 1995], and [Zhang 1995]. For instance, we consider a real rank n group
G = Sp(n, R) and its Siegel parabolic subgroup P . If n is even, then Problem B is affirmative.
However, if n is odd, Problem B fails except for holomorphic and anti-holomorphic discrete
series.
    In this article, we first consider the case that G is a complex reductive group. In this case,
X = GC /PC = G/P ×G/P has a unique open G-orbit (say O0 ). Let g = Lie(G) and p = Lie(P ).
We denote by m a Levi part of p. We fix a Cartan subalgebra h of g such that h ⊆ p. We denote
by w0 (resp. wp) the longest element of the Weyl group with respect to (g, h) (resp. (m, h)). O0
satisfies the Assumption A if and only if w0 wp is an involution.
    In fact, we have :

                                                 3
    Theorem C (Theorem 1.2.6) Assume G is a complex reductive group. AO0 ֒→ u IndG             P (ξ2δ )
if and only if w0 wp is a Duflo involution in the Weyl group for (g, h).
    The condition “ w0 wp is a Duflo involution.” is same as the existence condition for a non-
trivial homomorphism between certain generalized Verma modules ([Matumoto 1993]). In fact,
AO0 can be identified with some non-class one degenerate principal series representation ([En-
right 1979] and [Vogan-Zuckerman 1984]). In viewpoint of this identification, the embedding in
Theorem C is nothing but an intertwining operator between degenerate principal seiries induced
from the homomorphism between generalized Verma modules. (cf. [Collingwood-Shelton 1990])
    For a Weyl group of type A, any involution is a Duflo involution. We get an affirmative
answer on the case of G = GL(n, C). Moreover, we have:
    Theorem D (Theorem 3.2.1) Under Assumption A, we have an affirmative answer on the
case of G = GL(n, R) and G = GL(n, H).
    In this case, as a submodule of u IndG  PC (ξ2δ ), AO0 is the image of intertwining operator from
                                              C

the degenerate principal series representation of which AO0 is realized as a quotient. This
intertwing operator is induced from a homomorphism between generalized Verma modules.
    Finally, we mention the case of G = U(m, n).
    Let G = U(m, n) and let P be an arbitrary prarabolic subgroup of G. In this case, As-
sumption A automatically holds for all the open orbits. However, there is an obvious necessary
condition. Since u IndGP (ξ2δ ) has a perfect pairing with an irreducible generalized Verma module,
any submodule of IndGu                                                            u   G
                          P (ξ2δ ) has the same Gelfand-Kirillov dimension as IndP (ξ2δ ). We call
an open G-orbit O in X = GC /PC good, if the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of AO equals that
of u IndG
        P (ξ2δ ). (We can determine good orbits applying a combinatorial algorithm described in
[Trapa 2001].) We denote by G the set of the good open G-orbits on X. We have:
    Theorem E (Corollary 2.10.3)
                                                             M
                                      Socle(u IndG
                                                 P (ξ2δ )) =    AO .
                                                          O∈G

Here, Socle(u IndG                                                     u  G
                    P (ξ2δ )) is the maximal semisimple submodule of IndP (ξ2δ ). In this case,
           G
Socle(u IndP (ξ2δ )) is the image of an intertwining operator induced from a homomorphism be-
tween generalized Verma modules.

Let G be a connected complex reductive linear Lie group. Let g be the Lie algebra of G, U (g)
the universal enveloping algebra of g, h a Cartan subalgebra of g, and ∆ the root system with
respect to (g, h). Let W be the Weyl group of the pair (g, h) and denote by w0 the longest
element of W . We fix a positive system ∆+ of ∆ and denote byP Π the corresponding Pbasis of ∆.
We fix a triangular decomposition g = n̄ ⊕ h ⊕ n such that n = α∈∆+ gα and n̄ = −α∈∆+ gα .
Here, gα is the root space with respect to α. We consider a Borel subalgebra b = h + n.
    We denote by g0 the normal real form of g which is compatible with the above decomposition
and denote by X ❀ X̄ the complex conjugation with respect to g0 . Then there is an anti-
automorphism, so-called Chevalley anti-automorphism, X ❀ t X of g which satisfies the following

   (3) t X = X (X ∈ h).
   We extend X ❀ t X to an anti-automorphism of U (g).
   We define a homomorphism of a real Lie algebra g → g × g by X ❀ (X, X̄) for X ∈ g. Then
the image of this homomorphism is a real form of g × g. Hence, we can regard g × g as the
complexification gc of g. kc = {(X, −t X) | X ∈ g} is identified with the complexification of a
compact form of g. kc is also identified with g by an isomorphism X ❀ (X, −t X) as complex
Lie algebras. We may regard G × G as a complexification GC of G. Let P be a standard
parabolic subgroup of G; namely the Lie algebra p of P contains b. We denote by M (resp. m)
the Levi part of P (resp. p) stable under the Chevalley anti-automorphism. We denote by np
the nilradical of p. Let S be the subset of Π corresponding to p; namely S is the basis of the
root system with respect to (m, h). Put S ′ = {−w0 α|α ∈ S}. We denote by p′ the standard
parabolic subalgebra corresponding to S ′ . We denote by wp the longest element of the Weyl
group with respect to (m, h).

1.2   Formulation of the problem and results
Under the above identification GC ∼
                                  = G × G, the complexification PC of P is identified with a
subgroup P × P of G × G. The complex generalized flag variety X = GC /PC is identified with
G/P ×G/P . X can be regarded as the set of parabolic subalgebra of g which is Ad(GC )-conjugate
to Lie(PC ) = pC ∼
                 = p × p.
   We easily have:
Proposition 1.2.1. X has a unique G-orbit (say O0 ). The following five conditions are equiv-
alent to each other.
    (1) O0 contains a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra of gC .
    (2) p and the parabolic subalgebra opposite to p are G-conjugate.
    (3) p = p′ .
    (4) S is stable under the action of −w0 .
    (5) w0 wp = wpw0 . (Namely w0 wp is an involution.)
    For X ∈ m, we define δp(X) = 21 tr adg(X)|np .
                                                 

    Then, δp is a one-dimensional representation of m. We see that 2nδp lifts to a holomorphic
group homomorphism ξ2nδp : M → C× for all n ∈ Z. Identifying MC ∼      = M × M , for n, m ∈
2Z we can regard χn,m = ξnδp ⊠ ξmδp as a real analytic group homomorphism M → C× .
Taking account of the natural projection P → M , we regard χn,m as a real analytic one-
dimensional representation of P . So, we can consider an unnormalized degenerate principal
series representation:
         u
         IndG                  ∞                     −1
             P (χn,m ) = {f ∈ C (G)|f (gp) = χn,m (p) f (g) (g ∈ G, p ∈ P )}kc -finite .

  If p = b, then δb = ρ = 21 α∈∆+ α. For t ∈ R, we define an unnormalized generalized Verma
                             P

module:
                                 u
                                   Mp(t) = U (g) ⊗U (p) Ctδp .
Here, Ctδp means the one-dimensional module of p such that m acts on it by tδp. If p = b,
we simply write u M (t) = u Mb(t). We denote by Ip(t) the annihilator of Mp(t) in U (g). From
[Vogan 1984], Mp(t) is irreducible for t 6 −1. Therefore Ip(t) is a primitive ideal for t 6 −1.

                                              5
    Under the identification gc ∼  = g × g, we identify U (gc ) ∼
                                                                = U (g) ⊗ U (g). We denote by
u     ǔ (u ∈ U (g) ) the anti-automorphism of U (g) generated by X ❀ −X (X ∈ g). If V is a
U (g)-bimodule, we can regard V as a U (gc )-module as follows.

                               (u1 ⊗ u2 )v = t ǔ1 vǔ2   (u1 , u2 ∈ U (g), v ∈ V ).

In particular, we may regard U (g)/Ip(t) as a U (gc )-module.
    We quote:

Theorem 1.2.2. ([Conze-Berline, Duflo 1977] 2.12 and 6.3)
     If n is an even integer such that n > 2, then u IndG
                                                        P (χn,n ) is isomorphic to U (g)/Ip(−n) as
U (gc )-modules.

    Together with [Borho-Kraft 1976] 3.6 and the primtivity of Ip(−n) (n > 0), we have:

Corollary 1.2.3. If n > 2, then u IndG     P (χn,n ) has a unique irreducible submodule (say Yn ). The
Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of Yn equals that of u IndG      P (χn,n ). The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of
u IndG (χ     )/Y   is strictly smaller than  that of Y   .
     P    n,n     n                                     n

     [Borho-Jantzen 1977] 4.10 Corollar (also see [Jantzen 1983] 15.27 Corollar) implies Ip(−n) =
Ip′ (n − 2).
     Since u IndG
                P (χ2,2 ) is the induced module associated with the canonical bundle, we only con-
sider the case of n = 2. For simplicity, we put I = Ip(−2) = Ip′ (0). Let M and N be
U (g)-modules. HomC (M, N ) has natural structure of a U (g)-bimodule. We introduce a U (gc )-
module structure on HomC (M, N ). We denote the kc -finite part of Hom(M, N ) by L(M, N ).
V      L(u M (0), V ) defines a category equivalence between a category of highest weight mod-
ules and a category of Harish-Chandra (gc , kc )-modules (Bernstein-Gelfand-Joseph-Enright cf.
[Bernstein-Gelfand 1980], [Joseph 1979]). Via this category equivalence, the 2-sided ideals of
U (g)/I correspond to the U (g)-submodules of u M (0)/I u M (0). In particular Y2 corresponds to
the irreducible highest weight module with the highest weight τ ρ − ρ ([Joseph 1979], also see
[Joseph 1983] p43). Here, τ ∈ W is the Duflo involution associated to the primitive ideal I.
For integral weights µ, ν ∈ h∗ , we denote by V (ν, µ) the Langlands (Zhelobenko) subquotient of
u IndG (ξ
      B ν+ρ ⊠ ξµ+ρ ). From [Joseph 1979] 4.5, we have:

Theorem 1.2.4. The unique irreducible submodule Y2 of u IndG
                                                           P (χ2,2 ) is isomophic to V (−τ ρ, −ρ) =
V (w0 τ w0 ρ, ρ).

    Next, under the equivalent conditions in Proposition 1.2.1, we compare Y2 with AO0 =
H dim np (O0 , L)k -finite .
                      First, we remark:
                  c


Theorem 1.2.5. ([Enright 1979], [Vogan-Zuckerman 1984])
   Assume that p satisfies the equivalent conditions in Proposition 1.2.1. Then we have

                                      A O0 ∼
                                           = u IndG         ∼u G
                                                  P (χ2,0 ) = IndP (χ0,2 ).

    Since 2δp = ρ−w0 wpρ, we see AO0 is the Langlands subquotient V (−w0 wpρ, −ρ) of u IndG
                                                                                          B (ξ−w0 wp ρ+ρ ⊠
ξ−ρ+ρ ).
    Since u Mp(−2) is the irreducible highest weight module of the highest weight −2δp = w0 wpρ−
ρ, we have:

                                                          6
Theorem 1.2.6. Assume that p satisfies the equivalent conditions in Proposition 1.2.1. Then
AO0 is isomorphic to the unique submodule of u IndG
                                                  P (χ2,2 ) if and only if w0 wp is a Duflo invo-
lution in W .
   In case that w0 wp is a Duflo involution, the embedding of AO0 into u IndG   P (χ2,2 ) can be
regarded as intertwining operators between degenerate principal series representation:
                                   u
                                       IndG           u   G
                                          P (χ2,0 ) ֒→ IndP (χ2,2 ),
                                   u
                                       IndG           u   G
                                          P (χ0,2 ) ֒→ IndP (χ2,2 ).

   In fact, the following result holds:

Proposition 1.2.7. ([Matumoto 1993])
   Let t be a non-negative even integer. Then we have
                                       u
                                           Mp(−t − 2) ֒→ u Mp(t)

if and only if w0 wp is a Duflo involution in W .
    Taking account of the isomorphism u IndG          ∼ u           u          ∗
                                            P (χm,n ) = ( Mp(−m)⊗ Mp(−n))k -finite , the above
                                                                                c
intertwining operator are induced from the embedding of the generalized Verma module.
    If W is a Weyl group of the type A, each involution in W is a Duflo involution ([Duflo 1977]).
Hence, we have:
Corollary 1.2.8. If G = GL(n, C) and p satisfies the equivalent conditions in Proposition 1.1,
the socle of u IndG
                  P (χ2,2 ) is isomorphic to AO0 .


§ 2.      U(m, n)
2.1   Root systems
Let m and n be non-negative integers. We fix a maximal compact subgroup K(m, n) of
G = U(m, n), which is isomorphic to U(m) × U(n). We denote by θ the Cartan involution
corresponding to K(m, n). We fix a θ-stable maximally split Cartan subgroup s H(m, n) of
U(m, n). We denote by s h(m, n) the complexified Lie algebra of s H(m, n). We remark that
all the Cartan subgroup of U(m, n) is connected. We denote by g(m, n) (resp. k(m, n))the
complexified Lie algebra of U(m, n) (resp. K(m, n)). So, we have g(m, n) ∼ = gl(m + n, C) and
k(m, n) ∼
        = gl(m, C) × gl(n,  C).
    We denote by KC (m, n) the complexification of K(m, n). So, KC (m, n) is isomorphic to
GL(m, C) × GL(n, C). We identify the complexification of U(m, n) with GL(m + n, C). First,
we consider the root system ∆(m, n) with respect to ∆(g(m, n), s h(m, n)). Then we can choose
an orthonormal basis e1 , ..., em+n of s h(m, n)∗ such that

                          ∆(m, n) = {ei − ej | 1 6 i, j 6 m + n, i 6= j}.

We choose the above e1 , ..., em+n so that θ(ei ) = em+n−i+1 for all 1 6 i 6 min{m, n} and
θ(ei ) = ei for all min{m, n} < i < m + n − min{m, n}.
    We fix a simple system Π(m, n) for ∆(g(m, n), s h(m, n)); Π = {e1 − e2 , ..., em+n−1 − em+n }.
We denote by ∆+ (m, n) the corresponding positive system.

                                                    7
2.2   Standard parabolic subgroups
Fix θ, s H(m, n), etc. as in 2.1.
   We also consider the particular orthonormal basis e1 , ..., em+n of s h∗ defined in 2.1. We
denote by E1 , ...., Em+n the basis of s h(m, n) dual to e1 , ..., em+n .
   Let κ = (k1 , ..., ks ) be a finite sequence of positive integers such that

                                 k = k1 + · · · + ks 6 min{m, n}.

We put ki∗ = k1 + · · · + ki for 1 6 i 6 s and k0∗ = 0. Hence ks∗ = k. Put m′ = m − k and
n′ = n − k.
    We put
                           2ki 
                           X                               
                    Ai =           ∗ +j − E
                                Eki−1             ∗          (1 6 i 6 s)),
                                           m+n−(ki−1 +j+1)
                          j=1

   Then we have θ(Ai ) = −Ai for 1 6 i 6 s. We denote by aκ (m, n) the Lie subalgebra of
s h(m, n)
       spanned by {Ai | 1 6 i 6 s}.
   We define a subset S(κ) of Π(m, n) as follows.

                  S(κ) = Π − {eki∗ − eki∗ +1 , em+n−ki∗ − em+n−ki∗ +1 |1 6 i 6 s}.

    We denote by Mκ (m, n) (resp. mκ (m, n)) the standard Levi subgroup (resp. subalgebra) of
U(m, n) (resp. g(m, n)) corresponding to S(κ). Namely Mκ (m, n) is the centralizer of aκ (m, n)
in U(m, n).
    We denote by Pκ (m, n) a parabolic subgroup of U(m, n) whose θ-stable Levi part is Mκ (m, n).
We choose Pκ (m, n) so that the roots in ∆(m, n) whose root spaces are contained in the com-
plexified Lie algebra of the nilradical of Pκ (m, n) are all in ∆+ (m, n). We denote by Nκ (m, n)
the nilradical of Pκ (m, n).
    Formally, we denote by U(0, 0) the trivial group {1} and we denote by GL(κ, C) a product
group GL(k1 , C) × · · · × GL(ks , C). Then, we have

                                Mκ (m, n) ∼
                                          = GL(κ, C) × U(m′ , n′ ).

GL(κ, C) and U(m′ , n′ ) can be identified with a subgroups of Mκ (m, n) up to their automor-
phisms. The Cartan involution θ induces Cartan involutions on Mκ (m, n), GL(κ, C), U(m′ , n′ )
and we denote them by the same letter θ.
   We denote by pκ (m, n), mκ (m, n), and nκ (m, n) the complexified Lie algebras of Pκ (m, n),
Mκ (m, n), and Nκ (m, n), respectively.

2.3   Parabolic inductions
For a general reductive Lie group G and its parabolic subgroup P , we define an unnormalized
induction as follows. We fix a maximal compact subgroup K and the corresponding Cartan
involution θ such that P has a θ-stable Levi part L. We denote by g, k, and l the complexified
Lie algebras of G, K,and L, respectively. We denote by U the nilradical of P . Let Z be a
Harish-Chanda (l, L ∩ K)-module and (π, H) be a Hilbert globalization of Z. u IndG P (Z) is the
K-finite part of

               {f ∈ C ∞ (G) ⊗ H | f (gℓn) = π(ℓ−1 )f (g) (g ∈ G, ℓ ∈ L, n ∈ U )}.

                                                 8
   Let m and n be non-negative integers and Let k be a positive integer such that k 6
min{m, n}. Let µ and ν be complex numbers such that µ + ν ∈ Z. We define a one-dimensional
                 k , Ck ) of GL(k, C) as follows.

                            k                           −ν
                           ηµ,ν (g) = det(g)µ det(g)            (g ∈ GL(k, C)).
When we identify M(k) (m, n) with GL(k, C) × U (m − k, n − k), there is ambiguity coming from
automorphisms of GL(k, C) and U (m − k, n − k). We choose P          the identification so that the
differential of the restriction of Ckµ,ν ⊠ Ctrivial to s H(m, n) is µ ki=1 ei + ν kj=1 em+n−j+1 ∈
                                                                                  P
s h(m, n)∗ . For a Harish-Chandra (g(m − k, n − k), K(m − k, n − k))-module Z, we define

                              u k                    U (m,n)
                               I [µ, ν](Z) = u IndP             (Ckµ,ν   ⊠ Z).
                                                      (k) (m,n)


Taking account of “ρ-shift”, we define the normalized parabolic induction by n I k [µ, ν](Z) =
u I k [µ + m′ +n′ +k , ν + m′ −n′ +k ](Z).

2.4   θ-stable parabolic subalgebras
In this article, we denote by N the set of the non-negative integers.
    We discuss θ-stable parabolic subalgebras with respect to U(m, n) (cf. [Vogan 1996] Example
4.5).
    Let ℓ be a positive integer. Put
                                                         ℓ         ℓ
             (                                                                                            )
                                                         X         X
                                                  ℓ   ℓ
Pℓ (m, n) = ((m1 , ..., mℓ ), (n1 , ..., nℓ )) ∈ N × N |   mi = m,   ni = n, mj + nj > 0 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ ,
                                                          i=1             i=1

We also put                                         [
                                        P(m, n) =         Pℓ (m, n),
                                                    ℓ>0
                                    P(0, 0) = P0 (0, 0) = {((∅), (∅))}.
If (m, n) ∈ P(m, n) satisfies (m, n) ∈ Pℓ (m, n), we call ℓ the length of (m, n). For (m, n) ∈
P(m, n), we define
                             I(m,n) = diag(Im1 , −In1 , ..., Imℓ , −Inℓ )
Here, for a positive integer Ik means the k × k identity matrix. If k = 0, we regard I0 as nothing.
Then we can consider the following realization of U (m, n).
                       U(m, n) = g ∈ GL(m + n, C)|t ḡI(m,n) g = I(m,n) .
                                                                          	

Let θ be the Cartan involution given by the conjugation by I(m,n) . In this realization, we
denote by q(m, n) the block-upper-triangular parabolic subalgebra of g(m, n) = gl(m + n, C)
with blocks of sizes p1 + q1 , ...., pℓ + qℓ along the diagonal. Then, q(m, n) is a θ-stable parabolic
subalgebra. The corresponding Levi subgroup U(m, n) consists of diagonal blocks.
                             U(m, n) ∼
                                     = U(m1 , n1 ) × · · · × U(mℓ , nℓ ).
We denote by g(m, n) the complexified Lie algebra of U(m, n). We denote by v(m, n) the
nilradical of q(m, n).
    Via the above construction of q(m, n), K(m, n)-conjugate class of θ-stable parabolic subal-
gebras with respect to U(m, n) is classified by P(m, n).

2.5     Cohomological inductions
First, we discuss the case of θ-stable maximal parabolic subalgbras.
    We fix non-negative integers m and n and ((m′ , p), (n′ , q)) ∈ P2 (m, n). Here, m′ = m − p
and n′ = n − q. For an integer h, we define a unitary character ηhp,q : U(p, q) → C× by

                                               ηhp,q (g) = det(g)h       (g ∈ U(p, q)).

We denote by Cp,q                             p,q
               h the representation space of ηh . For a Harish-Chandra (g(m−p, n−q), K(m−
p, n − q))-module Z, we define

induction functor defined in [Knapp-Vogan 1995] p328 or [Vogan 1982], then we have
                                                                          pm′ +qn′

   Let (m, n) = ((m1 , ..., mℓ ), (n1 , ..., nℓ )) ∈ Pℓ (m, n) and h = (h1 , ...., hℓ ) ∈ Zℓ . We define

                  A(m,n) [h] = Rmℓ ,nℓ [hℓ ](Rmℓ−1 ,nℓ−1 [hℓ−1 ](· · · (Rm2 ,n2 [h2 ](Cm
                                                                                       h1
                                                                                         1 ,n1
                                                                                               )) · · · )).

A(m,n) [h] is nothing but a derived functor module for q(m, n).
  We quote:

Theorem 2.5.1. ([Vogan 1984], [Vogan 1988], [Trapa 2001] Lemma 3.5)
   (1) A(m,n) [h] is a derived functor module in the good range for q(m, n) if and only if
hi > hi+1 for all 1 6 i < ℓ. In this case, A(m,n) [h] is non-zero and irreducible.
   (2) A(m,n) [h] is a derived functor module in the weakly fair range for q(m, n) if and only
if
                                      mi + ni + mi+1 + ni+1
                        hi − hi+1 > −                           (1 6 i < ℓ).
                                                2
   (3) A(m,n) [h] is a derived functor module in the mediocre range for q(m, n) if and only if
                                                                           X
                hi − hi+1 > − max{mi + ni , mj + nj } −                           (mk + nk ) (1 6 i < j 6 ℓ).
                                                                         i<k<j

In this case A(m,n) [h] is zero or irreducible.
    The mediocre condition is weaker than the weakly fair condition. The weakly fair condition
is weaker than the good condition. The mediocre condition implies the unitarity of A(m,n) [h].




                                                                   10
2.6    Associated varieties
It is well-known that the GL(m+n, C)-nilpotent orbits in g(m, n) = gl(m+n, C) are parametrized
by the Young diagrams with m + n boxes. (Cf. [Collingwood-McGovern 1993])
     Fix a sequence of positive integers c = (c1 , ..., cℓ ) such that c1 + · · · + cℓ = m + n. Let τ ∈ Sℓ
be a permutation such that cτ (1) > cτ (2) > · · · > cτ (ℓ) . Denote by Y (c) the Young diagram
consisting of ℓ columns such that the length of the i-th column of Y (c) is cτ (i) . We denote by
O(c) the nilpotent GL(m + n, C)-orbit in g(m, n) corresponding to Y (c).
     For (m, n) = ((m1 , ..., mℓ ), (n1 , ...nℓ )) ∈ Pℓ (m, n), we put m + n = (m1 + n1 , ..., mℓ +
nℓ ). For (m, n) = ((m1 , ..., mℓ ), (n1 , ...nℓ )) ∈ Pℓ (m, n), the Richardson orbit with respect to
q(m, n) coincides with O(m + n). (Kraft, Ozeki, Wakimoto, see [Collingwood-McGovern 1993]
Theorem 7.2.3 ) Namely, O(m + n) is a unique nilpotent GL(m + n, C)-orbit in g(m, n) such
that O(m, n) ∩ v(m, n) is open in v(m, n). (Here, v(m, n) is the niradical of q(m, n.) It is
known that dim O(m + n) = 2 dim v(m, n).
     Let g(m, n) = k(m, n) ⊕ s(m, n) be the complexified Cartan decomposition with respect to
θ.
     The nilpotent KC (m, n)-orbits in s(m, n) are parametrized by (the equivalence classes of) the
signed Young diagrams of signature (m, n). (See [Collingwood-McGovern 1993]) Here, a signed
Young diagram is a Young diagram in which every box is labeled with + or − sign in such a
way that signs alternate across rows. We call two signed Young diagrams equivalent, if one can
be obtained from the other by interchanging rows of equal length. The signature of a signed
Young diagram is the ordered pair (m, n), where m (resp. n) is the number of boxes labeled +
(resp. −). For a signed Young diagram T , we denote by |T | the Young diagram obtained by
earasing all + and − on Y . We call |T | the shape of T . For a Young diagram consisting of m + n
boxes, we denote by Sm,n (Y ) the set of the equivalence classes of the signed Young diagrams of
signature (m, n) whose shape is Y .
     The above parametrization of the nilpotent KC (m, n)-orbits in s(m, n) is compatible with the
parametrization of GL(m + n, C)-nilpotent orbits in g(m, n) = gl(m + n, C) via Young diagrams.
Namely, for any nilpotent KC (m, n)-orbit O in s(m, n) corresponding to a signed Young diagram
T , the nilpotent GL(n + m, C)-orbit Ad(GL(m + n, C))O corresponds to |T |. For a nilpotent
GL(m + n, C)-orbit O in g(m, n) corresponding to a Young diagram Y , O ∩ s(m, n) is the union
of the nilpotent KC (m, n)-orbits corresponding to the elements of Sm,n (Y ).
     For a Harish-Chandra (g(m, n), K(m, n))-module M , we denote by Dim(M ) (resp. Ass(M ))
the Gelfand-Krillov dimension (resp. the associated variety) of M . (cf. [Vogan 1978], [Vogan
1991]) For an irreducible Harish-Chandra (g(m, n), K(m, n))-module M with an integral in-
finitesimal character, Ass(M ) is the closure of a single nilpotent KC (m, n)-orbit in s(m, n).
([Barbasch-Vogan 1982])

Lemma 2.6.1. ([Trapa 2001] Lemma 5.6)
    Let Z be a Harish-Chandra (g(m, n), K(m, n))-module such that Ass(Z) is the closure of
a single nilpotent KC (m, n)-orbit in s(m, n) corresponding to a signed Young diagram T . Let
h be a sufficiently large integer so that the ccohomological induction Rp,q [h](Z) is in the good
range. Then Ass(Rp,q [h](Z)) is the closure of a nilpotent KC (m + p, n + q)-orbit (say O) in
s(m + p, n + q). Then, the signed Young diagram corresponding to O is obtained by adding p
pluses and q minuses, from top to bottom, to the row-ends of T so that
    (1) at most one sign is added to each row-end,


                                                   11
    (2) the signs of the resulting diagram must alternate across rows, and
    (3) add signs to the highest row possible.
    (The resulting diagram may not have rows of decreasing length. If necessary, we can choose
another signed Young diagram equivalent to T in order to obtain a signed Young diagram as the
result of the above procedure.)
    Remark As explained in [Trapa 2001], we can calculate the associated varieties of derived
functor modules of U(m, n) using Lemma 2.6.1.
    For (m, n) ∈ P(m, n), Dim(Am,n [h]) 6 12 dim O(m, n). We call (m, n) ∈ P(m, n) normal,
if Dim(Am,n [h]) = 12 dim O(m, n) holds in the good range. It is kown that for a normal
(m, n) ∈ Pℓ (m, n) and any mediocre h ∈ Zℓ , we have Dim(Am,n [h]) = 12 dim O(m, n) and
Ass(Am,n [h]) = Ass(Am,n [h′ ]), where h′ is any parameter in the good range. (cf. [Trapa
2001]) Fix a sequence of positive integers c = (c1 , ..., cℓ ) such that c1 + · · · + cℓ = m + n. Put

        O(c) = {(m, n) ∈ Pℓ (m, n) | (m, n) is normal and mi + ni = ci for all 1 6 i 6 ℓ}

   Examining the procedure described in Lemma 2.6.1, we can easily have:
Corollary 2.6.2. Let c be a sequence of positive integers as above. The correspondence (m, n)
Ass(A(m,n) [h]) induces a bijection
                                                            ∼
                                             Φc : O(c) → Sm,n (Y (c)).

2.7    The annihilator of a degenerate principal series representation
Let m and n be non-negative integers. Let κ = (k1 , ..., ks ) be a finite sequence of positive integers
such that k = k1 + · · · + ks 6 min{m, n}. Let u = (u1 , ..., us ) and v = (v1 , ..., vs ) be sequences of
complex numbers such that ui + vi ∈ Z for all 1 6 i 6 s. Let h ∈ Z. We consider a degenerate
principal series representation of U(m, n) as follows.
             n κ
              Im,n [u; h; v]   = n I k1 [u1 , v1 ](n I k2 [u2 , v2 ](· · · (n I ks [us , vs ](Chm−k,n−k ) · · · )).

If m = n = k, we regard C0,0  h as the trivial representation of the trivial group. In this case
n I κ [u; h; v] does not depend on h. We denote by δ κ                      s
   m,n                                                m,n an element of C whose i-th entry is
     ∗
m+n−ki−1
   2     ,   where ki∗ = k1 + · · · + ki . We denote by J(u, h, v) the annihilator of n Im,n
                                                                                          κ [u; h; v] in

the universal enveloping algebra U (g(m, n)).
    We define a normalized generalized Verma module as follows. Let p be a parabolic subalgebra
of g = g(m + n). Let p = l + n be a Levi decomposition of p. We define a one-dimensional
representation −ρp of l by −ρp(X) = 12 (ad(X)|n) (X ∈ l). For a one-dimensional representation
ξ of l we extend ξ ⊗ −ρp to a one-dimensional representation of p as usual and define n Mp(ξ) =
U (g) ⊗U (p) (ξ ⊗ −ρp).
    We define a weight on s h(m, n) by
                                                                                           
                    Xs      Xki                 m+n−2k
                                                  X            X s        ki
                                                                          X
       ξ(u, h, v) =     ui       eki−1
                                    ∗ +j  + h         ek+j +      vs−i     em+n−k+ki−1 ∗ +j  .

                    i=1         j=1                        j=1                i=1           j=1

Obviously, ξ(u, h, v) can be extend to a one-dimensional representation of l. We denote by
p̄κ (m, n) the opposite parabolic subalgebra to pκ (m, n). n Im,n
                                                              κ [u; h; v] and n M
                                                                                 pκ (m,n) (−ξ(u, h, v))


                                                             12
have a perfect pairing. n Mp̄κ (m,n) (ξ(u, h, v)) and n Mpκ (m,n) (−ξ(u, h, v)) also have a perfect pair-
ing.
    Hence we have:

Lemma 2.7.1. J(u, h, v) coincides with the annihilator of n Mp̄κ (m,n) (ξ(u, h, v)).

   Let c = (c1 , ..., cℓ ) be a sequence of non-negative integers such that c1 + · · · + cℓ = m + n.
Put c∗i = c1 + · · · + ci and c∗0 = 0. We define a subset S[c] of Π(m, n) as follows.

                                 S[c] = Π − {ec∗i − ec∗i +1 |1 6 i 6 ℓ}.

We denote by p(c) the standard parabolic subalgebra of g(m, n) associated to S[c]. Under
appropriate realization of g(m, n) as gl(m + n, C), p(c) is the block-upper-triangular parabolic
subalgebra of gl(m + n, C) with blocks of sizes c1 , ..., cℓ along the diagonal. If ci = 0 for some
i, “a block of size 0” means nothing. Namely, we simply neglect it. We denote by p̄(c) the
parabolic subalgebra opposite to p(c). For a sequence h = (h1 , ..., hℓ ) of complex numbers, we
define a weight on s h(m, n) as follows.
                                                                
                                          ℓ
                                          X      Xci
                                   ξ(h) =   hi        ec∗i−1 +j  .
                                            i=1      j=1

    Hereafter, we consider a degenerate principal series representation n Im,n
                                                                           κ [u; h; v] with an

integral infinitesimal character. Namely, we assume that u − δm,n , v + δm,n ∈ Zs . We define
                                                               κ         κ

h = (h1 , ..., h2s+1 ) as follows.

                                        h1 = h,
                                       h2i = us−i+1 (1 6 i 6 s),
                                     h2i+1 = vi (1 6 i 6 s).

We also define a sequence of positive integer c by

                                  c1 = m + n − 2k,
                                  c2i = c2i+1 = ks−i+1 (1 6 i 6 s).

   We define
                         Ξ(u, h, v) = {τ ∈ S2s+1 | hτ (1) > · · · > hτ (2s+1) }.
Obviously Ξ(u, h, v) is non-empty. For τ ∈ S2s+1 , put cτ = (cτ (1) , ..., cτ (2s+1) ) and hτ =
(hτ (1) , ..., hτ (2s+1) ) From [Borho-Jantzen 1977] 4.10 Corollar and Lemma 2.7.1, we have:

Proposition 2.7.2. If τ ∈ Ξ(u, h, v), then J(u, h, v) coincides with the annihilator of n Mp̄(cτ ) (ξ(hτ )).

    From [Vogan 1984], we see that n Mp̄(cτ ) (ξ(hτ )) is irreducible for τ ∈ Ξ(u, h, v). Hence we
see that J(u, h, v) is a primitive ideal.




                                                   13
2.8    The associated variety of a degenerate principal series representation
For a Harish-Chandra (g(m, n), K(m, n))-module Z, we denote by [Z] the distribution charac-
ter of Z. Let V and M be Harish-Chandra (g(m, n), K(m, n))-modules. We write V ∼ M ,
if a virtual character [V ] − [M ] is a linear combination of the distribution characters of ir-
reducible Harish-Chandra (g(m, n), K(m, n))-modules whose Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions are
strictly smaller than Dim(V ).
    As in 2.7, we consider a degenerate principal series representation n Im,nκ [u; h; v] with an

integral infinitesimal character. We also define c and h from (u, h, v) as in 2.7. We have:

Proposition 2.8.1. Assume that Ξ(u, h, v) contains the identity element e. Then, we have

Here, ȟ = (ȟ1 , ..., ȟ2s+1 ) is defined by ȟi = hi −     2      + c∗i−1   (1 6 i 6 2s + 1).

Proof. If h2i = h2i+1 for 1 6 i 6 s, the irreducible decomposition of n Im,n κ [u; h; v] is given in

[Matumoto 1996] Theorem 3.3.1. Each irreducible component is a derived functor module. So,
the statement of the proposition in this particular case is obtained by examining the method of
computation, via Lemma 2.6.1, of the associated varieties of derived functor modules appearing
the decomposition formula. The general case is obtained by applying the standard argument of
the translation principle into the weakly fair range. ([Vogan 1984], [Vogan 1988], [Vogan 1990])

    Remark We may prove Proposition 2.8.1 directly using [Matumoto 2002] Theorem 2.2.3.
    Remark that O(c) is the Richardson orbit with respect to pκ (m, n). We denote by O(c) its
closure.
    It is easy to see that Ass(n Im,n
                                   κ [u; h; v]) does not depend on the choice of the parameter
                    n κ
(u; h; v) such that Im,n [u; h; v]) has an integral infinitesimal character. Hence, we have:
Corollary 2.8.2. For any n Im,n
                            κ [u; h; v] with an integral infinitesimal character, we have


                                  Ass(n Im,n
                                         κ
                                             [u; h; v]) = O(c) ∩ s(m, n)

   From [Schmid-Vilonen 2000], we can identify the wave front sets of derived functor modules.
The wave front set of the degenerate principal series represntation is obtained by [Barbasch-
Vogan 1980]. Hence, Corollary 2.8.2 is equivalent to the following result.
Corollary 2.8.3. The real Lie algebra Lie(Nκ (m, n)) intersects all the real form of the Richard-
son GL(m + n, C)-orbit in gl(m + n, C) with respect to pκ (m, n).
    Remark The corresponding statement to Corollary 2.8.3 is incorrect for a general semisim-
ple Lie algebra. For instance, the Jacobi parabolic subalgebra of sp(2, R) gives a counterexample;
there are three real forms but the nilradical intersects only one of them.

2.9    Irreducible constituents of the maximal Gelfand-Kirillov dimension
As in 2.7, we consider a degenerate principal series representation n Im,n
                                                                       κ [u; h; v] with an integral

infinitesimal character. We also define c and h from (u, h, v) as in 2.7.
    We have:

Here, ȟ = (ȟτ1 , ..., ȟτ2s+1 ) is defined by ȟτi = hτ (i) −     2
                                                                      τ (i)

 τ ∗                                                            τ ∗
c i−1 = cτ (1) + · · · + cτ (i−1) for 2 6 i 6 2s + 1 and c 0 = 0.

Proof. Applying the standard argument of the translation principle into the weakly fair range
([Vogan 1984], [Vogan 1988], [Vogan 1990]), we may assume that hτ (1) ≫ · · · ≫ hτ (2s+1) .
    From [Barbasch-Vogan 1983] (also see [Trapa 2001] section 6), we see
    (1) An irreducible Harish-Chandra (g(m, n), K(m, n))-module with an integral infinitesimal
character is determined by its annihilator and its associated variety.
    (2) The associated variety of an irreducible Harish-Chandra (g(m, n), K(m, n))-module
with an integral infinitesimal character is irreducible.
                                                                                                  τ
    Let (m, n) ∈ O(cτ ). From [Vogan 1986] Proposition 16.8, we see the annihilator of A(m,n) [ȟ ]
                                                                      τ
contains the annihilator of n Mp̄(cτ ) (ξ(hτ )). Since Dim(A(m,n) [ȟ ]) = 12 dim O(c), Proposition
                                                  τ
2.7.2 implies that the annihilator of A(m,n) [ȟ ] coincides with J(u, h, v). So, taking account of
the above (1) and (2), we have
                                                                  τ

                                           (m,n)∈O(cτ )

Here, n(m, n) are positive integers.
     Hence, we have only to show that:
     (✸) The number of irreducible constituents of the maximal Gelfand-Kirillov dimension in
n I κ [u; h; v] equals the number of signed Young diagrams of the shape Y (c).
   m,n
     Since the datum (u, h, v) is recovered from h, we write I[h] = n Im,n      κ [u; h; v], J(h) =

J(u, h, v), and Ξ[h] = Ξ(u, h, v).
     We regard the symmetric group S2s+1 as a Coxeter group such that a set of transpositions
{(i, i + 1) | 1 ≤ i < 2s + 1} is the simple reflections. We denote by ℓ(τ ) the length of τ ∈ S2s+1 .
     We prove (✸) by the induction on ℓ(τ ). The case of ℓ(τ ) = 0 follows from Proposition 2.8.1.
     So, we assume ℓ(τ ) > 0.
     Then there exists some 1 6 i 6 2s + 1 such that the length of τ ′ = τ ◦ (i, i + 1) is strictly
smaller than τ . Since we assumed that hτ (i) ≫ hτ (i+1) ≫ hτ (i+2) , there is a positive integer r0
such that hτ (i+1) ≫ hτ (i) − r0 ≫ hτ (i+2) . For r ∈ N, we define h(r) = (h(r)1 , ..., h(r)2s+1 ) by
h(r)j = hj for j 6= τ (i) and h(r)τ (i) = hτ (i) − r. Then, we see Ξ(h) = {τ } and Ξ(h(r0 )) = {τ ′ }.
For r ∈ N, we define weights on s h(m, n) as follows.

Then, ψ(r) and ψ ′ (r) are contained in the same Weyl group orbit and represent the same
infinitesimal character. In fact, they are the infinitesimal character of I[h(r)].
    For λ, µ ∈ s h(m, n)∗ such that λ − µ is integral, we denote by Tλµ the translation functor.
Namely, if Z is a Harish-Chandra module with a generalized infinitesimal character λ, Tλµ (Z) =
Pµ (Vµ−λ ⊗C Z). Here, Vµ−λ is the irreducible finite-dimensional representation with an extreme
weight µ − λ and Pµ is the projection functor to the generalized infinitesimal character µ.

[T ′ rr0 (I[h(r0 )])] = [I[h(r)]].
    We denote by H(r) the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules Z
such that J(h(r)) annihilates Z and Dim(Z) = 12 dim O(c). If we apply [Vogan 1990] Corollary

    (1) T0r gives a bijection of H(0) onto H(r).

   From Lemma 2.9.2, Lemma 2.9.3, and the exactness of the translation functors, we see that
the number of irreducible constituent of the maximal Gelfand-Kirillov dimension in I[h] equals
the number of those in I[h(r0 )]. From the assumption of the induction, (✸) holds for I[h(r0 )].
Therefore, we have (✸) for I[h]. Q.E.D.

2.10     The socle of a degenerate principal series representation with a finite-
         dimensional quotient
In order to obtain the main result, we prepare the following lemma in the general setting.
Lemma 2.10.1. Let G be a real reductive group and let K be a maximal compact subgroup of
G. We denote by g the complexified Lie algebra of G. For a Harish-Chandra (g, K)-module M ,
we denote by M h the Hermitian dual of M . (cf. [Vogan 1984])
   Let I be a Harish-Chandra (g, K)-module and let Ψ : I h → I be a (g, K)-homomorphism.
   We assume the following three conditions (a1)-(a3).
   (a1) Dim(Kernel(Ψ)) < Dim(I h ).
   (a2) Let V be an arbitrary irreducible constituent of I such that Dim(V ) = Dim(I). Then,
V ∼
 h
   = V and the multiplicity of V in I is one.
   (a3) Let W be any submodule of I, then Dim(W ) = Dim(I).

                                                             16
    Then, we have
    (1) Socle(I) = Ψ(I h ).
    (2) Dim(I/Socle(I)) < Dim(I).
    Here, Socle(I) is the maximal semisimple submodule of I.
    In particular, any irreducible constituent V of I such that Dim(V ) = Dim(I) is a submodule
of I.

Proof. Let V be any irreducible submodule of I. Then V h ∼= V has to be realized as a quotient
of I h . From (a3), we have Dim(V ) = Dim(I). From (a1), we see Ψ(I h ) contains an irreducible
constituent isomorphic to V . From (a2), we have V ⊆ Ψ(I h ). Hence Socle(I) ⊆ Ψ(I h ).
    In order to show (1), we have only to show that Ψ(I h ) ∼  = I h /Kernel(Ψ) is semisimple.
Let W be any irreducible quotient of I h /Kernel(Ψ). Then, W is also a quotient of I h . So,
W h is realized as a submodule of I. Hence, Dim(W h ) = Dim(W ) = Dim(I) from (a3). So,
W ∼ = W h ⊆ Socle(I) ⊆ Ψ(I h ) Hence, I h /Kernel(Ψ) contains a submodule isomorphic to W .
(a2) implies the multiplicity of W is one. Since any irreducible quotient of I h /Kernel(Ψ) is a
submodule, Ψ(I h ) ∼= I h /Kernel(Ψ) is semisimple.
    (2) follows from (a1) and (1). 
    Now, we state the main result.
Theorem 2.10.2. Assume u = (u1 , ..., us ), v = (v1 , ..., vs ) ∈ Zs and h ∈ Z satisfy u1 > · · · >

          n                      κ             κ
              Mpκ (m,n) (−ξ(u + δm,n , h, v − δm,n )) ֒→ n Mpκ (m,n) (−ξ(v − δm,n
                                                                              κ             κ
                                                                                  , h, u + δm,n )).

This embedding induces an intertwining operator

                    ϕ : n Im,n
                           κ         κ
                               [v − δm,n           κ
                                         ; h; u + δm,n ]) → n Im,n
                                                               κ         κ
                                                                   [u + δm,n           κ
                                                                             ; h; v − δm,n ]).
                                      κ [u + δ κ ; h; v − δ κ ]).
Moreover, we have Image(ϕ) = Socle(n Im,n     m,n          m,n

Proof. From the standard argument of translation principle, we may assume that u1 = u2 =
· · · = us = h = vs = · · · = v1 = 0. For simplicity, we put I = n Im,n   κ [δ κ ; 0; −δ κ ]) and
                                                                              m,n       m,n
p = pκ (m, n). Then, I h = n Im,n  κ [−δ κ ; 0; +δ κ ]). Moreover, I (resp. I h ) has a perfect
                                         m,n       m,n
pairing with a generalized Verma module u Mp(−2) (resp. u Mp(0)). (See 1.2.) In this case
p satisfies the equivalent conditions in Proposition 1.2.1. Hence, Proposition 1.2.7 implies that
u M (−2) ֒→ u M (0). This induces an intertwining operator Ψ : I h → I (for instance, see
      p           p
[Collingwood-Shelton 1990] 2). Since Kernel(Ψ) has a perfect pairing with u Mp(0)/u Mp(−2)
and Dim(u Mp(0)/u Mp(−2)) < Dim(u Mp(−2)) = Dim(I), we have Dim(Kernel(Ψ)) < Dim(I).
Since u Mp(−2) is irreducible, any submodule of I also has a parfect pairing with u Mp(−2). This
implies that any submodule of I has the same Gelfand-Kirillov dimension as I. Together with
Lemma 2.10.1, we can apply Theorem 2.9.1 to our setting and obtain the result.         Q.E.D.

    The Matsuki duality ([Matsuki 1988]) tells us KC (m, n)-conjugacy class of θ-stable parabolic
subalgberas {q(m, n) | m + n = c(m, n, κ)} parameterizes the open U(m, n)-orbits of the com-
plexified generalized flag variety X(m, n, κ) = GL(m + n, C)/Pκ (m, n)C . We denote L the
canonical line bundle on X(m, n, κ). For an open U(m, n)-orbit O in X(m, n, κ), we put

Here, S = dim(v(m, n)∩k(m, n)) and q(m, n) is the θ-stable parabolic subalgebra corresponding
to O. We call an open U(m, n)-orbit O in X(m, n, κ) good, if Dim(AO ) = dim X(m, n, κ). Then
we may rewrite Theorem 2.10.2 as follows.

§ 3.       GL(n, R) and GL(n, H)
3.1   Parabolic subalgebras and generalized flag varieties
Let n be a positive integer greater than 1. Let K be one of R, C, or H. We consider G = GL(n, K).
We denote by s H the Lie group of n × n diagonal non-singular matrices in G. Fix a maximal
compact subgroup K of G. We denote by θ the corresponding Cartan involution. We may
choose the maximal compact subgroup K appropriately so that s H(n) is θ-stable. We denote
by g (resp. k) the complexified Lie algebra of G (resp. K). We denote by s h the complexified
Lie algebra of s H. Then, s h is a maximally split Cartan subalgebra of g.
    Let c = (c1 , ..., cs ) be a sequence of positive integers such that c1 + · · · + cs = n. We denote
by P (c) the block-upper-triangular parabolic subgroup of G with blocks of sizes c1 , ..., cs along
the diagonal. We denote by PC (c) (resp. GC ) the complexification of P (c) (resp. G). We denote
by p(c) the complexified Lie algebra of P (c). We denote by m(c) the Levi subalgebra of p(c)
such that s h(n) ⊆ m(c). and denote by MC (c) the corresponding complexified Levi subgroup.
We denote by n(c) the nilradical of p(c).
    We denote by w0 (resp. wc ) the longest element of the Weyl group for (gl(n, C), s h) (resp.
(m(c), s h)).
    From [Matsuki 1979], we easily see the full flag variety of GC has a unique open G-orbit.
Hence, an arbitrary generalized flag variety X(c) = GC /PC (c) has a unique open G-orbit (say
Oc ). We regard as X(c) the set of parabolic subalgebras of g which are Ad(GC )-conjugate to
p(c). The following result is more or less known.
Proposition 3.1.1. Let c = (c1 , ..., cs ) be a sequence of positive integers such that c1 +· · ·+cs =
n. Then, the following conditions are equivalent to each other.
   (1) Oc contains a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra of g .
   (2) p(c) and the parabolic subalgebra opposite to p(c) are G-conjugate.
   (3) For any integer 1 6 i 6 2s , we have ci = cs−i+1 .
   (4) w0 wc = wc w0 . (Namely, w0 wc is an involution.)




                                                  18
   We denote by ωc the canonical line bundle on X(c). Namely, ωc is a homogeneous line
bundle associate with the character of MC (c) :
                                           det Ad(g)|n(c) ∈ C× .
                                                         
                             MC (c) ∋ g

3.2   The socle of degenerate principal series representation with respect to
      canonical bundle
Assume that c satisfies the equivalent conditions in Proposition 3.1.1 and choose a θ-stable
parabolic subgroup q(c) in Oc such that q(c) has a Levi part l(c) which is a comlexified Lie
algebra of its normalizer L(c) in G. We denote by u(c) the nilradical of q(c)
    Put AOc = H S (Oc , ωc )K-finite ∼
                                     = Aq(c) (0). Here, S = dim(k ∩ u(c)).
    The case of K = C is discussed in Corollary 1.2.8. For the remaining cases, we have:

Theorem 3.2.1.
    (1) If K = H, then AOc is a unique irreducible submodule of u IndGP (c) (ωc ).
    (2)    If K = R, then there is a one-dimensional representation χ which is trivial on the
identical component of P (c) and AOc is a unique irreducible submodule of u IndGP (c) (ωc ⊗ χ).
    (3) In any case, AOc is the image of an intertwining operator induced from an embedding
of a generalized Verma module.

Proof. We consider the case of K = H. Write H = C + jC. We put K = Sp(n) = {g ∈
        t
   √ H)| ḡg = Ik }. Then we regard gl(k, C) as a real Lie subalgebra of gl(k, H). For ℓ ∈ Z and
GL(k,
t ∈ −1R, we define a one-dimensional unitary representation ξℓ of GL(k, C) as follows.
                                                 det(g) ℓ
                                                        
                                    ξℓ (g) =               .
                                               | det(g)|
Let q(k) be a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra with a Levi decomposition q(k) = gl(k, C)+u(k). We
choose the nilradical u(k) so that ξℓ is in the good range with respect to q(k) for sufficient large
ℓ. Derived functor modules with respect to q(k) is called quarternionic Speh representations.
                                     gl(k,H)⊗ C,Sp(k) k(k+1)
(∗)                    Ak (ℓ) = (u Rq(k),O(k)R          )      (ξℓ+2k )   (ℓ ∈ Z).

For ℓ ∈ Z, Ak (ℓ) is derived functor module in the good (resp. weakly fair) range in the sense of
[Vogan 1988] if and only if ℓ > 0 (resp. ℓ > −k).
   We define d = (d1 , ..., d[ s+1 ] ) by di = 2ci = 2cs−i+1 (1 6 i 6 2s ). Here, [ s+1
                                                                                     2 ] = max{j ∈
                               2
Z | j 6 s+1
          2 }. If s is odd, we put d s+1  = c s+1 . We put d∗i = d1 + · · · + di . The Levi part M (d)
                                       2        2
of P (d) can be identified with GL(d1 , H) × · · · × GL(d[ s+1 ] , H).
                                                              2
    For g ∈ GL(k, H), we denote by det(g) ∈ R× the noncommutative determinant ([Artin 1957]
p151). For t ∈ R, we denote by χt a character of GL(k, H) defined by χt (g) = det(g)t .
    More or less [Vogan 1986] tells us (also see [Matumoto 2002] 2.4 )

                                                 i=1

    Here, id means the identity representation of GL(n − d∗[ s ] , H). (We regard GL(0, H) as the
                 N                                           2

Lemma 3.2.2. ([Sahi 1995], [Zhang 1995])

                                 A2k (ℓ) ∼ n IndP ((k,k)) (χℓ+k ⊠ χ−ℓ−k ).

    We define c′ = (c′1 , ..., c′s ) by c′2i−1 = c′2i = ci = cs−i+1 (1 6 i 6 2s ). If s is odd, we put
cs = c s+1 . Combining the above (⋆) and Lemma 3.2.2, we can easily see

                                          i=1

Since M (c) is G-conjugate to M (c′ ), Harish-Chandra’s character theory implies the following
character identity.
                            s                                    

Hence,
                                          AOc ∼ u IndG
                                                     P (c) (ωc ).

We can apply an argument similar to the proof of Theorem 2.10.2 and we have the desired result
for the case of G = GL(n, H).
    For the case of G = GL(n, R), we can prove the result similarly. We may apply [Speh 1983]
instead of (⋆). The corresponding result of result of Lemma 3.2.2 is also obtained in [Sahi-Stein
1990], [Sahi 1995], and [Zhang 1995]. (Also see [Howe-Lee 1999]) 
