                                                                                        Introduction

                                                  In this paper we prove a product formula for the c-function associated to a non-compactly
                                            causal symmetric space M . Let us recall here the basic facts. Let G be a connected semisimple
                                            Lie group, τ : G → G be a non-trivial involution and H = Gτ . Then M := G/H is a semsimple
                                            symmetric space. The space M is called non-compactly causal, if q: = {X ∈ g: τ (X) = −X}
                                            contains an open H -invariant hyperbolic cone C 6= Ø . In this case S := H exp(C) is a open
                                            subsemigroup of G. A spherical function on M is an H -biinvariant continuous function on
                                            S/H ⊆ M , which defines an eigendistribution of the algebra of H -invariant differential operators
                                            on M , see [FHÓ94], [KNÓ98], [Ól97]. There exists a maximal abelian hyperbolic subspace a of
                                            q such that C = Ad(H).(a ∩ C). Let
                                                                                             Z
                                                                              ϕλ (g.x0 ) =       aH (gh)λ−ρ dµH (h)
                                                                                             H

                                            be a spherical function given by a convergent integral similar to the expression for the spherical
                                            functions on the Riemannian symmetric spaces G/K . Here x0 ∈ M is the coset {H} and
                                            aH (g) ∈ A: = exp(a) is determined by g ∈ HaH (g)N . The asypmtotic behaviour of ϕλ (a.x0 )
                                            along S ∩ A is given by ϕλ (a.x0 ) ∼ c(λ)aλ−ρ , where ρ is half the sum over the positive roots
                                            counted with multiplicities. The function c(λ) is the c-function of the space M . It turns out
                                            that the c-function is a product of two c-function, c(λ) = cΩ (λ)c0 (λ) where c0 (λ) is the Harish-
                                            Chandra c-function of a Riemannian subsymmetric space G(0)/K(0) and cΩ (λ) is a function
                                            associated to the real bounded symmetric domain H/(H ∩ K), where K is a τ -stable maximal
                                            compact subgroup of G. The c-function was first introduced by Oshima-Sekiguchi in [OS80],
                                            whereas cΩ (λ) was first introduced in [FHÓ94].
                                                  The c-function for a Riemannian symmetric space G/K can be written as a product of
                                            c-functions of rank one symmetric spaces associated to each restricted root of g (Gindikin–
                                            Karpelevic formula). For general non-Riemannian symmetric spaces G/H one cannot expect
                                            this type of result. However, for non-compactly causal symmetric spaces we show in this paper
                                            (cf. Theorem III.5) that such a product formula holds. The case of Cayley type spaces has already
                                            been treated by J. Faraut in [Fa95] by the use of Jordan algebra methods and in [Gr97] the case
                                            Sl(n, R)/ SO(p, q) is dealed. The approach presented here is general, different and relies on new
                                            insights on the fine convex geometry of the real bounded symmetric domain Ω (cf. Theorem II.5
                                            and Theorem II.7.)
                                                  Our result has important applications. The c-function was the last unknown part in

representations (cf. [Kr99]). Further it gives us important information on the normalized spherical
functions ϕeλ : = cΩ (λ)−1 ϕλ . One knows that the function λ 7→ ϕ    eλ (s.x0 ) has a meromorphic
continuation to a∗C (cf. [Ól97]) and the product formula gives us important information on the
poles. In particular, this allows more detailed analysis of the spherical Laplace transform, in
particular Paley-Wiener type theorems.



       I. Non-compactly causal symmetric spaces and Lie algebras

    In this section we introduce notation and recall some facts concerning non-compactly causal
symmetric Lie algebras and their associated symmetric spaces. Our source of reference is [HiÓl96].



                                      Algebraic preliminaries

        Let g be a simple finite dimensional real Lie algebra. Let τ : g → g be a non-trivial
involution. Then (g, τ ) is a symmetric Lie algebra. We write g = h + q for the τ -eigenspace
decomposition of g corresponding to the eigenvalues +1 and −1 . Let θ be a Cartan involution
of g which commutes with τ and let g = k + p be the associated Cartan decomposition.
        For a, b ⊆ g let za (b): = {X ∈ a : [X, Y ] = 0, Y ∈ b} be the centralizer of b in a . We call
(g, τ ) non-compactly causal, or simply NCC, if zq∩p (h ∩ k) 6= {0} . We call (g, τ ) non-compactly
Riemannian (NCR) if τ is a Cartan involution. If not otherwise stated from now on (g, τ )
denotes a NCC symmetric Lie algebra. Then zq∩p (h ∩ k) = z(q ∩ p) = RX0 is one dimensional.
Let a ⊆ q ∩ p be a maximal abelian subspace and note that RX0 ⊆ a and that a is maximal
abelian in p . We write ∆ = ∆(g, a) for the root system of g with respect to a and
                                                         M
                                          g = zg (a) ⊕         gα
                                                         α∈∆


for the corresponding root space decomposition. We write g(0): = h ∩ k + q ∩ p and note that
(g(0), τ (0)), with τ (0): = τ |g(0) , is NCR. If α ∈ ∆ then either gα ⊆ g(0) or gα ⊆ q ∩ k + h ∩ p . A
root α ∈ ∆ is called compact if gα ⊆ g(0) and non-compact if gα ⊆ q∩k+h∩p . We write ∆k and
∆n for the collection of compact and non-compact roots, respectively. Note that ∆ = ∆k ∪∆        ˙ n.
      We can and will normalize X0 such that Spec(ad X0 ) = {−1, 0, 1} . Then ∆k = {α ∈
∆: α(X0 ) = 0} and we can choose a positive system ∆+ of ∆ such that

                              ∆+           +
                               n : = ∆n ∩ ∆ = {α ∈ ∆n : α(X0 ) = 1}


and such that ∆+
               k : = ∆k ∩ ∆
                           +
                             is a positive system in ∆k . Let ∆− := −∆+ , ∆−      +
                                                                           n := −∆n and
  −       +
∆k := −∆k .
      We recall now few facts about the structure of the root system ∆. Two roots α, β ∈ ∆ are
said to be strongly orthogonal if α ± β is not a root. Let Γ: = {γ1 , . . . , γr } be a system of strongly
orthogonal roots in ∆+ n of maximal length, i.e., Γ consists of pairwise strongly orthogonal roots
and has maximal number of elements with respect to this property. We set

                                    W: = NInn(h∩k) (a)/ZInn(h∩k) (a)

and call W the small Weyl group of ∆.
                        The   c -function for non-compactly   causal symmetric spaces                    3

Proposition I.1. For the root system ∆ = ∆(g, a) of a non-compactly causal symmetric Lie
algebra (g, τ ) the following assertions hold:
   (i) The root system ∆ is reduced, i.e., if α ∈ ∆ then 2α 6∈ ∆. In particular, there exists at
       most two root lengths.
  (ii) All long roots in ∆+  n are conjugate under the small Weyl group W . Moreover, all roots
       γi , 1 ≤ i ≤ r , are long.
 (iii) Write ∆+                              +             +
                 n,s for the short roots in ∆n . Then, if ∆n,s 6= Ø , one has

                                              1
                                      ∆+
                                       n,s = { (γi + γj ): 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r}
                                              2

      and all elements of ∆+
                           n,s are conjugate under W .

Proof. (i) [HiÓl96, Th. 3.2.4] or [NÓ99, Lemma 2.12].
(ii) [NÓ99, Lemma 2.26].
(iii) [NÓ99, Lemma 2.22, Lemma 2.24].
      For α ∈ ∆ let Hα ∈ {[X, τ (X)]: X ∈ gα } ⊆ a be such that α(Hα ) = 2 . For each 1 ≤ i ≤ r
let Hi = Hγi . We set c: = spanR {H1 , . . . , Hr } ⊆ a and write b for the orthogonal complement
of c in a with respect to the Cartan-Killing form; in particular a = c ⊕ b .

Proposition I.2.      The positive system ∆+ k can be chsosen such that for the restriction of
∆ = ∆(g, a) to c the following assertions hold:

                                 1                             1
                        ∆+
                         n |c = { (γi + γj ): 1 ≤ i, j ≤ r} ∪ { γi : 1 ≤ i ≤ r},
                                 2                             2
                                 1                               1
                   ∆+
                    k |c \{0} = { (γi − γj ): 1 ≤ j < i ≤ r} ∪ {− γi : 1 ≤ i ≤ r}.
                                 2                               2
Moreover, the second sets in the two unions from above may or may not occur simultaneously.
Proof.     [NÓ99, Th. 2.21] or [Kr99, Th. IV.4].
      Since we have free choice for ∆+                               +             1
                                     k we assume in the sequel that ∆k |c \{0} ⊆ { 2 (γi − γj ): 1 ≤
                1
j < i ≤ r} ∪ {− 2 γi : 1 ≤ i ≤ r} .

Lemma I.3. Assume that ∆n,s 6= Ø and let Πk be the set of simple roots corresponding to
∆+                                       ∗                                      ∗             1
 k . Then there exits β1 , . . . , βm ∈ b , βj (X0 ) = 0 , and δ1 , . . . δl ∈ b , δi (X0 ) = 2 , such that

                 1                                                      1
           Πk = { (γi+1 − γi ): 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1} ∪ {β1 , . . . , βm } ∪ {− γr + δi : 1 ≤ i ≤ l}.
                 2                                                      2

Here the last set occurs if and only if there exits half roots in ∆ |c .
Proof.       For each α ∈ ∆ let sα denote the corresponding reflection. Then sγj ( 12 (γi + γj )) =
1                                                                         1
2 (γi − γj ), i 6= j together with Proposition I.1(iii) shows that ∆k ⊇ { 2 (γi − γj ): 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ r} .
Thus Proposition I.2 yields that

                              1
                        ∆+                                     ∗    ⊥
                         k ⊆ { (γi − γj ): 1 ≤ j < i ≤ r} + (b ∩ X0 )
                              2
                                1                                   1
                           ∪ {− γi : 1 ≤ i ≤ r} + {δ ∈ b∗ : δ(X0 ) = } ∪ b∗ .
                                2                                   2
Now the assertion follows easily from Proposition I.2 and the fact that ∆ is a root system.
4                                                                                             June 8, 1999

        We define the maximal cone in a is defined by

                               Cmax : = {X ∈ a: (∀α ∈ ∆+
                                                       n ) α(X) ≥ 0}.

Lemma I.4. Let X0 = X0b + X0c with X0b ∈ b and X0c ∈ c. Then we have X0b , X0c ∈ Cmax .
Proof. First note that X0c = 12 (H1 + . . . + Hr ) and so X0c ∈ Cmax by Proposition I.2.
                                                                           1
To show X0b ∈ Cmax let α ∈ ∆+    n . Then Proposition I.2 shows that α = 2 (γi + γj ) + β with
β ∈ b , β(X0 ) = β(X0 ) = 0 , or α = − 2 γi + δ with δ ∈ b and δ(X0 ) = δ(X0b ) = 21 . In any case
     ∗               b                 1                  ∗

we have α(X0b ) ≥ 0 concluding the proof of the lemma.
        Finally we define subalgebras of g by

                                      Analytic preliminaries
      Let GC be a simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra gC and let G be the analytic
subgroup of GC corresponding to g. Let H = Gτ = {X ∈ G: τ (g) = g} . We write A, K ,
N , N , Nk± , Nn± for the analytic subgroups of G which correspond to a , g(0), h, k, n, n,
n±    ±                                       ±    ±
 k , nn . Note that the groups A, N , N , Nk , Nn are all simply connected and that the
corresponding exponential mappings expA : a → A, expN : n → N etc. are all diffeomorphisms.
Let G(0) = ZG (X0 ) = {g ∈ G: Ad(g).X0 = X0 } . Then H and G(0) are τ and θ invariant,
H = (H ∩ K) exp(h ∩ p) and G(0) = (H ∩ K) exp(q ∩ p).
      The Lie algebra g decomposes as g = h + a + n and the multiplication mapping

                                 H × A × N → G, (h, a, n) 7→ han

is an analytic diffeomorphism onto its open image HAN .
      Note that N = Nn− ⋊ Nk− . We have


(1.1)                          N ∩ HAN = exp(Ω)Nk− = Nk− exp(Ω)

with Ω ∼
       = H/H ∩ K a real bounded symmetric domain in n−
                                                     n.




         II. The geometry of the real bounded symmetric domain Ω
      We denote by κ the Cartan-Killing form on g and define an inner product on g by
hX, Y i: = −κ(X, θ(Y )) for X, Y ∈ g. Let Xi ∈ gγi be such that Hi = [Xi , X−i ], with
X−i = τ (Xi ). By [HiÓl96] and Herman’s Convexity Theorem we have

(2.1)                 Ω = {X ∈ n−
                                n : k ad(X + τ (X))k < 1}
                                        Xr
(2.2)                   = Ad(H ∩ K).{      tj X−j : −1 < tj < 1, j = 1, . . . , r} ,
                                          j=1

where k · k denotes the operator norm corresponding to the scalar product h·, ·i on g. Note that
(2.1) implies that Ω is a convex balanced subset of n−
                                                     n .

Remark II.1. Recall the definition of the maximal cone Crmmax in a . Then it is clear from
the characterization (2.1) of Ω that ead X .Ω ⊆ Ω for all X ∈ Cmax . We also have a minimal
cone in a defined by
                                                                   X
                   Cmin : = cone({[X, τ (X)]: X ∈ gα , α ∈ ∆+ }) =   R + Hα .
                                                                                     α∈∆+
                                                                                        n


We note that Cmin ⊆ Cmax and in particular Hi ∈ Cmax for each 1 ≤ i ≤ r .
    The following concept turns out to be very useful for the investigation of the fine convex
geomety of Ω.

Definition II.2.      (Oshima-Sekiguchi) By a signature of ∆ we understand a map ε: ∆ →
{−1, 1} with the following properties:
(S1) ε(α) = ε(−α) for all α ∈ ∆.
(S2) ε(α + β) = ε(α)ε(β) for all α, β ∈ ∆ with α + β ∈ ∆.
         If ε : ∆ → {−1, 1} is a signature then θε : g → g defined by θε (X) = ε(α)θ(X), X ∈ gα
and θε |zg (a) = θ|zg (a) is an involution on g that commutes with θ (see [OS80, Def. 1.2]). As
τ |zg (a) = θ|zg (a) and τ |gα = ±θ|gα , with + if α is compact and −1 if α non-compact, it follows
that θε also commutes with τ .

Lemma II.3. Keep the notation of Definition II.2.
 (i) If ε is a signature of ∆, then the prescription
                                         
                                           X        for X ∈ zg (a),
                               σε (X): =
                                           ε(α)X for X ∈ gα , α ∈ ∆
      defines an involutive automorphism of g. The involution σε commutes with both τ and θ .
 (ii) Let Π: = {α1 , . . . , αn } be a basis of ∆. Then for any collection (ε1 , . . . , εn ) ∈ {−1, 1}n
      one can define a signature ε of ∆ by setting
                                     n
                                     X                  n
                                                        Y                     X
                               ε(±         ni αi ): =         εni i     for         ni αi ∈ ∆.
                                     i=1                i=1                   i=1

(iii) Let the notation be as in (ii). Then ε 7→ (ε(αi ))ni=1 defines a bijection between the set of
      signatures of ∆ and {−1, 1}n .
Proof. (i) This follows by the Oshima-Sekiguchi construction because σε = τε θ . (ii) is clear
and (iii) follows from (ii).
     In the sequel we identify signatures with elements in {−1, 1}n .

Lemma II.4. Let ε be a signature of ∆. Then σε (Ω) = Ω.
                                                                Pr
Proof.    Let X ∈ Ω. By (2.2) there is a k ∈ H ∩ K and Y = j=1 tj X−j , −1 < tj < 1
such that Ad(k).Y =PX . As σε commutes with τ and θ it follows that σε (k) ∈ K ∩ H . Hence
σε (X) = Ad(σε (k)). rj=1 ε(γj )tj X−j ∈ Ω.
     Recall that there is basis Π ⊆ ∆+ having the form

                                            Π = {α0 , α1 , . . . , αn }

with α0 long and non-compact and αi , 1 ≤Pin≤ n compact. Thus every non-compact         negative
                                                                                      +
root γ ∈ ∆−
          n  can be written as γ = −α0 −   i=1 m i αi , m i ∈ N 0 . By our choice of ∆k we have
α0 = γ1 .

                                                   γ
Theorem II.5.       For each γ ∈ ∆−           −
                                  n let pγ : nn → g be the orthogonal projection. Then

                                                 X ∈ Ω ⇒ pγ (X) ∈ Ω.
                      P
Proof.     Let X = γ∈∆−    n
                             Xγ ∈ Ω with Xγ ∈ gγ , γ ∈ ∆−  n . We have to show that Xγ ∈ Ω.
Recall that there are at most two root length in ∆ (cf. Proposition I.1(i)).
Case 1: γ is a long root.
     By Proposition I.1(ii) there exists an element
                                                 Prh ∈ NInn(h∩k) (a) such that h.γ = −α0 . Thus
we may assume that γ = −α0 = −γ1 . Let H: = j=2 Hj . By Remark II.1 we have
                                           X1 : = lim et ad H .X ∈ Ω.
                                                    t→+∞
                       P
If we express X1 =       β∈∆−n
                               Xβ as a sum of root vectors, then Proposition I.2 implies that
β |c = −γ1 or β = 21 γ1 − δ with δ(X0b ) = 12 . Since X0b ∈ Cmax (cf. Lemma I.4), we now get
                                                                  b
                                          Xγ = lim et ad X0 .X1 ∈ Ω.
                                                   t→+∞

Case 2: γ is a short root.
     By Proposition I.1(iii) we may assume that γ = 12 (γ1 + γ2 ) and by Lemma I.3 we may
suppose α0 = γ1 , αj = 21 (γj+1 − γj ) for 1 ≤ j ≤ r − 1 . Write
                                             X
                                       X=        Xm1 ,...,mn ,
                                                      mi ≥0
                              Pn
where Xm1 ,...,mn ∈ g−(α0 +      i=1
                                       mi αi )
                                           . Then we have to show that X1,0,...,0 ∈ Ω. Set
                               X                                  X
                   Xev : =              Xm1 ,...,mn and Xodd : =       Xm1 ,...,mn .
                             mn ≡0(2)                                  mn ≡1(2)

Then X = Xev + Xodd and we claim that Xev , Xodd ∈ Ω. Let ε = (1, 1, 1, . . . , −1). Then by
Lemma II.4 we get:
                     σε (X) = σε (Xev + Xodd ) = Xev − Xodd ∈ Ω .
Since Ω is balanced and convex we moreover have
                       1                                  1
                 Xev = (X + σε (X)) ∈ Ω and Xodd = (X − σε (X)) ∈ Ω.
                       2                                  2
By repeating this argument we thus my assume that
                                         X
                                 X=             Xm1 ,...,mn .
                                                    m1 ≡1(2)
                                                   mj ≡0(2),j>1

                                                                        Pr
Now we apply the contraction semigroup generated by H =                   j=3   Hj ∈ Cmax and obtain
                                           X1 : = lim et ad H .X ∈ Ω.
                                                    t→+∞
                                                    P
Thus we may assume X = X1 and X =                      β∈∆− n
                                                              Xβ with −β = γ, γ1 , γ2 , 12 (γ1 + γ2 ) +

β, − 2 γ1 + σP1 , − 2 γ2 + σ2 and β, σ1 , σ2 ∈ b , σ1 (X0 ) = σ2 (X0 ) = 2 (cf. Proposition I.2). Write
β = −γ1 − j=1 mj αj . The cases β = γ1 and β = γ2 are excluded, since we have m1 = 0 ,
resp. m1 = 2 , contradicting m1 ≡ 1(2). Applying to X the contraction semigroup generated
by X0b ∈ Cmax excludes the case β = − 12 γ1 + σ1 and β = − 21 γ2 + σ2 . Let now Y ∈ b such that
δj (Y ) > 0 , 1 ≤ j ≤ l , and βj (Y ) > 0 , 1 ≤ j ≤ m (cf. Lemma I.3). Then ∆+       n ⊆ N0 [Π] shows
that Y ∈ Cmax . But then
                                       Xγ = lim et ad Y .X ∈ Ω,
                                                    t→+∞
completing the proof Case 2 and hence of the theorem.

                                     Subdomains of rank one
        For α ∈ ∆+ we set                                               ′
                                    g(α): = gα + g−α + [gα , g−α ]
and τ (α): = τ | g(α) . Then (g(α), τ (α)) is a symmetric subalgebra of (g, τ ) of real rank one,
that is a(α): = a ∩ g(α) is one dimensional. Further we set h(α): = h ∩ g(α) etc. We denote
by G(α), A(α) etc. the analytic subgroups of G corresponding to g(α), a(α) etc. Let
H(α) = G(τ )τ (α) = G(α) ∩ H .
      Assume that α ∈ ∆+     n . Then (g(α), τ (α)) is NCC and n(α) = n+      n (α) = g .
                                                                                          α

Lemma II.6. Let α ∈ ∆+      n and sα ∈ G(α) be a representaive of the one element big Weyl
group NG(α) (a(α))/ZG(α) (a(α)) of g(α). Then
                                                                      
                      N (α) ∩ H(α)A(α)N (α) ∪˙ N (α) ∩ H(α)sα A(α)N (α)

is open and dense in N (α).
Proof.     This follows by Matsukis Theorem (cf. [Ma79, Theorem 3]), if we can show that
M (α): = ZK(α) (a(α)) ⊆ H(α) because sα M (α) = M (α)sα . Let F = exp(ia(α)) ∩ G(α). Then
one has M (α) = F ZH(α)o (a(α)) by [NÓ99, Lemma 5.7]. But if f ∈ F then τ (α)(f ) = f −1 = f ,
by the same lemma. Hence F ⊆ H(α), which implies that M (α) ⊆ H(α).

Theorem II.7.       Let α ∈ ∆+
                             n . Then Ω ∩ n(α) = Ω(α).
Proof. ” ⊇ ”: This is clear.
” ⊆ ”: Note that Ω ∩ n(α) is open and convex in n(α). We have
                                                          
(2.3)                            exp(Ω) ∩ H(α)sα A(α)N (α) = Ø,

since exp(Ω) ⊆ HAN and HAN ∩ Hsα AN = Ø by Matsukis Theorem. In view of (2.3), Lemma
II.7 implies that there exists an open dense subset Ωα of Ω ∩ n(α) such that Ωα ⊆ Ω(α). Now
the assertion follows from the fact that both Ω(α) and Ω ∩ n(α) are open and convex.

whenever the defining integral exist. We write E , EΩ and E0 for the domain of definition of c,
cΩ and c0 , respectively. We call c the c-function of the non-compactly causal symmetric space
G/H and cΩ the c-function of the real bounded symmetric domain Ω, while c0 is the usual
c-function of the non-compact Riemannian symmetric space G(0)/K(0).

Remark III.2. (a) The choice of the particular analytic realization G/H of (g, τ ) as a
symmetric space is immaterial for the definition of the c-function.
(b) We have E = E0 ∩ EΩ and for all λ ∈ E one has the splitting

                                                c(λ) = c0 (λ)cΩ (λ)

(cf. [FHÓ94, Lemma 9.2]).
(c) The c-functions can be written as Laplace transforms (cf. [KNÓ98]). Let us explain this for
the c-function c. For c0 and cΩ one has analogous statements.
       There exists a positive Radon measure µ on a such that
                                                                   Z
                               (∀λ ∈ E)        c(λ) = Lµ (λ): =         eλ(X) dµ(X),
                                                                    a


i.e., c is the Laplace transform of µ. In particular we see that the domain of definition E is a
tube domain over a convex set, i.e., one has

                                                    E = ia∗ + ER

with ER ⊆ a∗ a convex subset of a∗ . One knows that int E is non-empty. Moreover, the fact that
c is a Laplace transform implies that c is holomorphic on int E and that c has no holomorphic
extension to a connected open tube domain strictly larger than int E .

      Now we are going to prove the product formula for the c-function cΩ . Our srategy is a
modified Gindikin-Karpelevic approach as presented in [GaVa88, p. 175–177] or [Hel84, Ch. IV].

      For a positive system R ⊆ ∆ we set nR : =         α∈−(∆+ ∩R) g   and write N R for the
corresponding analytic subgroup of G. We define an auxiliary c-function by
                                                Z
                                    cR (λ): =            aH (n)−(λ+ρ) dµN R (n)

     For a single root α ∈ ∆+ we set ρα : = 21 mα α and write
                                           Z
                               cα (λ): =            aH(α) (n)−(λ+ρα ) dµN (α) (n).
                                           N (α)

We denote by Eα ⊆ a∗C the domain of definition of cα .

Proposition III.3.           For any positive system R ⊆ ∆ we have that
                                                                Y
                                                cR (λ) =                   cα (λ)
                                                           α∈(R∩∆+ )

                                                   T
and cR (λ) is defined if and only if λ ∈               α∈(R∩∆+ )     Eα .
Proof. We proceed by induction on |R ∩ ∆+ |. If R ∩ ∆+ = Ø , then the assertion is clear.
      Assume that R ∩ ∆+ 6= Ø . Then we find an element β ∈ R ∩ ∆+ which is simple in R .
Set Q: = sβ .R . Then Q = R\{β} ∪ {−β} since ∆ is reduced (cf. Proposition I.1(i)). Thus we
have (Q ∩ ∆+ )∪{β}
                ˙   = R ∩ ∆+ . We now have to distinguish to cases.
Case 1: β is compact.
In this case, the HAN -decomposition of G(β) coincides with the Iwasasa decomposition, i.e.
G(β) = K(β)A(β)N (β). Thus cR (λ) = cβ (λ)cQ (λ) follow as in [GaVa88, Prop. 4.7.6].
Case 2: β is non-compact.

Set N Q : = N Q ∩ Nk− , N Q : = N Q ∩ Nn− and note that N Q = N Q ⋊ N Q . Since N R = N (β)N Q
we thus get

                       Z       Z      Z
            cR (λ) =            n       k
                                            aH (nβ nn nk )−(λ+ρ) dµN (β) (nβ ) dµN n (nn ) dµN k (nk ).
                                                                                                Q        Q
                       N (β)   NQ      NQ


     If nβ nn nk ∈ N ∩ HAN , then (1.1) implies that nβ nn ∈ exp(Ω). Since n−
                                                                            n is abelian,
Theorem II.5 therefore implies that nβ ∈ exp(Ω) and so nβ ∈ exp(Ω(β)) by Theorem II.7.
Therefore we can write nβ = hβ aβ nβ with hβ ∈ H(β), aβ ∈ A(β) and nβ ∈ N (β). Now one
can proceed as in [GaVa88, p. 175–177] and one gets cR (λ) = cβ (λ)cQ (λ).

Remark III.4. If we choose R = −∆+                                                      +
                                           n ∪ ∆k (this is a positive system since ∆n is W -
invariant), then we have c0 = cR and Proposition III.3 results in the Gindikin-Karpelevic product

                            Eα . We want to apply Proposition III.3 to R = ∆+ . In view of
Remark III.2(b) and Remark III.4, we thus get

By [FHÓ94, (10.3)] one has
                                                 m            λ(Hα ) mα    
                                                      α
(3.2)                     cΩ(α) (λ) = 2mα −1 B            ,−         −   +1

and

(3.3)                         EΩ(α) = {λ ∈ a∗C : Re λ(Hα ) < 2 − mα }.

It follows from (3.3) that

(3.4)                    EΩ′ = {λ ∈ a∗C : (∀α ∈ ∆+
                                                 n ) Re λ(Hα ) < 2 − mα }.

Besides EΩ = EΩ′ all assertions of the theorem now follow from (3.1)-(3.4). Finally, EΩ = EΩ′
follows from the fact that all c-functions involved are Laplace transforms (cf. Remark III.2(c)).
The following simple fact that shows that we can split off all the non-compact roots to get the
cΩ -function before we come to the compact roots.

Lemma III.6. Let R be a any positive system of roots in ∆. If R ∩ ∆+          n 6= Ø , then R ∩ ∆n
                                                                                                   +

contains a a root that is simple in R .
                                                                                          Pn
                                     set of simple roots in R . Let γ ∈ R∩∆+
Proof. Let {β0 , . . . , βn } be the P                                     n . Then γ =     i=0 ni βi
                                        n
with ni ∈ N0 . Thus 1 = γ(X0 ) = i=0 ni βi (X0 ) which implies that βi (X0 ) > 0 for at least one
βi . But then βi ∈ ∆+n.
