                                                     Abstract. We study Harish-Chandra representations of the Yangian Y(gl2 )
                                                     with respect to a natural maximal commutative subalgebra which satisfy a
                                                     polynomial condition. We prove an analogue of the Kostant theorem showing
                                                     that the restricted Yangian Yp (gl2 ) is a free module over the corresponding
                                                     subalgebra Γ and show that every character of Γ defines a finite number of
                                                     irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over Yp (gl2 ). We study the categories of
                                                     generic Harish-Chandra modules, describe their simple modules and indecom-
                                                     posable modules in tame blocks.

                                                Throughout the paper we fix an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0.
                                             Consider the pair (U, Γ) where U is an associative k-algebra and Γ is a subalgebra
                                             of U . Denote by cfs Γ the cofinite spectrum of Γ, i.e.,
                                                        cfs Γ = {maximal two-sided ideals m of Γ | dim Γ/m < ∞}.
                                             A finitely generated module M over U is called a Harish-Chandra module (with
                                             respect to Γ) if                   M
                                                                          M=         M (m),
                                                                                      m∈cfs Γ
                                                                                         1

where
                 M (m) = {x ∈ M | mk x = 0 for some                   k ≥ 0}.
   Harish-Chandra modules play a central role in the classical representation the-
ory; see e.g. Dixmier [Di]. In particular, weight modules over a semisimple Lie
algebra are Harish-Chandra modules with respect to a Cartan subalgebra. An-
other important example is provided by the Gelfand–Tsetlin modules [DFO1] over
the universal enveloping algebra U (gln ) of the general linear Lie algebra gln . They
are Harish-Chandra modules with respect to the Gelfand–Tsetlin subalgebra of
U (gln ). The latter is the commutative subalgebra generated by the centers of
U (glk ), k = 1, . . . , n. A theory of Harish-Chandra modules for general pairs (U, Γ)
is developed in [DFO2].
   An irreducible Harish-Chandra module M is said to be extended from m ∈ cfs Γ
if M (m) 6= 0. A central problem in the theory of Harish-Chandra modules is to
investigate the existence and uniqueness conditions for such an extension. In the
case where the extension is unique, the irreducible Harish-Chandra modules are
parametrized by some equivalence classes of the elements of cfs Γ. It has been
recently proved in [Ov] that for the case of Gelfand–Tsetlin modules over gln the
number of pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible modules extended from a given m ∈
cfs Γ is nonzero and finite.
   In this paper we begin a detailed study of Harish-Chandra modules over the
Yangians. The Yangian for gln is a unital associative algebra Y(gln ) over k with
                                   (1)   (2)
countably many generators tij , tij , . . . where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, and the defining
relations
(1.1)            (u − v) [tij (u), tkl (v)] = tkj (u) til (v) − tkj (v) til (u),
where
                                            (1)         (2)
                         tij (u) = δij + tij u−1 + tij u−2 + · · ·
and u, v are formal variables. This algebra originally appeared in the works on
the quantum inverse scattering method ; see e.g. Takhtajan–Faddeev [TF], Kulish–
Sklyanin [KS]. The term “Yangian” and generalizations of Y(gln ) to an arbitrary
simple Lie algebra were introduced by Drinfeld [D1]. He then classified finite-
dimensional irreducible modules over the Yangians in [D2] using earlier results of
Tarasov [T1, T2]. An explicit construction of every such module over Y(gl2 ) is
given in those papers by Tarasov and also in the work by Chari and Pressley [CP].
Apart from this case, the structure of a general finite-dimensional irreducible rep-
resentation of the Yangian remains unknown. In the case of Y(gln ) a description
of generic modules was given in [M1] via Gelfand–Tsetlin bases. A more general
class of tame representations of Y(gln ) was introduced and explicitly constructed by
Nazarov and Tarasov [NT]. Another family of representations has been constructed
in [M3] via tensor products of the so-called evaluation modules. An important role
in these works is played by the Drinfeld generators [D2]
             ai (u),   i = 1, . . . , n,     bi (u), ci (u),    i = 1, . . . , n − 1
of the algebra Y(gln) which are defined as certain quantum minors of the ma-
trix T (u) = tij (u) . The coefficients of the series ai (u), i = 1, . . . , n form a
commutative subalgebra of Y(gln ) which can be regarded as an analogue of the
Gelfand–Tsetlin subalgebra of U(gln ). We shall consider the Harish-Chandra mod-
ules for Y(gln ) with respect to this particular subalgebra. So, the Harish-Chandra
                     HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES FOR YANGIANS                               3


modules for Y(gln ) are natural analogues of the Gelfand–Tsetlin modules for gln
[DFO1]. Note also that the tame modules over Y(gln ) [NT] is a particular case of
Harish-Chandra modules.
  In this paper we are concerned with Harish-Chandra modules for the Yangian
Y(gl2 ). Recall that every irreducible finite-dimensional Y(gl2 )-module contains a
unique vector ξ annihilated by t12 (u) and which is an eigenvector for the Drinfeld
generators a1 (u) and a2 (u) defined by
(1.2)       a1 (u) = t11 (u) t22 (u − 1) − t21 (u) t12 (u − 1),   a2 (u) = t22 (u);
see [T1, T2] and [CP]. Moreover, there exists an automorphism tij (u) 7→ c(u) tij (u)
of Y(gl2 ), where c(u) ∈ 1 + u−1 k[[u−1 ]], such that the eigenvalues of ξ become
polynomials in u−1 under the corresponding twisted action of the Yangian. This
prompts the introduction of the class of Harish-Chandra polynomial modules over
Y(gl2 ), i.e., such Harish-Chandra modules where the operators a1 (u) and a2 (u) are
polynomials. More precisely, due to (1.2), it is natural to require that for some
positive integer p the polynomials a1 (u) and a2 (u) have degrees 2p and p, respec-
tively. Note that a1 (u) is the quantum determinant of the matrix T (u) [IK], [KS].
Its coefficients are algebraically independent generators of the center of Y(gl2 ).
   We can interpret the definition of Harish-Chandra polynomial modules using
the algebra Yp (gl2 ) called the Yangian of level p; see Cherednik [C1, C2]. It is
                                                                                (r)
defined as the quotient of Y(gl2 ) by the ideal generated by the elements tij with
r ≥ p + 1. A Harish-Chandra polynomial module over Y(gl2 ) is just a Harish-
Chandra module over Yp (gl2 ) for some positive integer p. In what follows we shall
consider Harish-Chandra modules over Yp (gl2 ) with respect to the commutative
subalgebra Γ generated by the coefficients of a1 (u) and a2 (u).
   Let us now describe our main results. First, we prove that Yp (gl2 ) is free as a left
(right) Γ-module (Theorem 3.4). This is an analogue of the well-known Kostant
theorem [K]. Each character of Γ can therefore be extended to an irreducible
Yp (gl2 )-module. An important role in our study is played by certain universal
Harish-Chandra modules over Yp (gl2 ) (Theorem 4.5) such that every irreducible
module in H(Yp (gl2 ), Γ) is a quotient of the corresponding universal module.
   Further, we show that Γ is a Harish-Chandra subalgebra (Theorem 5.3) in the
sense of [DFO2] which allows us to apply the general theory of [DFO2] to the study
of Harish-Chandra modules for Yp (gl2 ). In particular, it provides an equivalence
between the category H(Yp (gl2 ), Γ) of Harish-Chandra modules and the category of
finitely generated modules over a certain category A whose objects are the maximal
ideals of Γ. We then use this to prove that the number of pairwise non-isomorphic
extensions of a character of Γ to an irreducible Yp (gl2 )-module is finite (Theo-
rem 7.2). The full subcategory HW (Yp (gl2 ), Γ) of H(Yp (gl2 ), Γ) which consists of
modules with diagonalizable action of Γ turns out to be equivalent to the category
of finitely generated modules over a certain quotient category of A (Section 2.1).
In Section 8 we study a full subcategory in HW (Yp (gl2 ), Γ) of generic modules,
this imposes a certain condition on the eigenvalues of a2 (u) while those of a1 (u)
are arbitrary. In particular, we give a complete description of irreducible mod-
ules (Theorem 8.5) and indecomposable modules in tame blocks of this category
(Theorem 8.9).

                                   2. Preliminaries
2.1. Harish-Chandra subalgebras. In this paper we shall only consider the pairs
(U, Γ) where the subalgebra Γ of U is commutative. In this case cfs Γ coincides with
the set Specm Γ of all maximal ideals in Γ.
    We let U -mod denote the category of finitely generated left modules over an
associative algebra U . The Harish-Chandra modules for the pair (U, Γ) form a
full abelian subcategory in U -mod which we denote by H(U, Γ). A Harish-Chandra
module M is called weight if the following condition holds: for all m ∈ Specm Γ and
all x ∈ M (m) one has m x = 0. The full subcategory of H(U, Γ) consisting of weight
modules will be denoted HW (U, Γ). The support of a Harish-Chandra module M is
the subset Supp M ⊆ Specm Γ which consists of those m which have the property
M (m) 6= 0. If for a given m there exists an irreducible Harish-Chandra module M
with M (m) 6= 0 then we say that m extends to M .
    A commutative subalgebra Γ ⊆ U is called a Harish-Chandra subalgebra of U
[DFO2] if for any a ∈ U the Γ-bimodule ΓaΓ is finitely generated both as left
and as right Γ-module. The property of Γ to be a Harish-Chandra subalgebra is
important for the effective study of the category H(U, Γ). In this case, for any
finite-dimensional Γ-module X the module U ⊗Γ X is a Harish-Chandra module.
For any a ∈ U set
    Xa = {(m, n) ∈ Specm Γ × Specm Γ | Γ/n is a subquotient of ΓaΓ/Γam}.
Equivalently, (m, n) ∈ Xa if and only if (Γ/n) ⊗Γ ΓaΓ ⊗Γ (Γ/m) 6= 0. Denote by ∆
the minimal equivalence on Specm Γ containing all Xa , a ∈ U and by ∆(A, Γ) the
set of the ∆-equivalence classes on Specm Γ. Then for any a ∈ U and m ∈ Specm Γ
we have
                         X                             M
(2.1)      aM (m) ⊆            M (n),     H(U, Γ) =          H(U, Γ, D).
                        (m,n)∈Xa                          D∈∆(U,Γ)

Define a category A = AU,Γ with the set of objects Ob A = Specm Γ and with the
space of morphisms A(m, n) from m to n, where
(2.2)                        A(m, n) = Γn ⊗Γ U ⊗Γ Γm
                    n
and Γm = lim Γ/m is the completion of Γ by m ∈ Specm Γ. Then the space
            ←n
A(m, n) has a natural structure of Γn −Γm -bimodule. We have the decomposition
                                      M
                              A=            A(D),
                                      D∈∆(U,Γ)

where A(D) is the restriction of A on D. The category A is endowed with the
topology of the inverse limit while the category of k-vector spaces (k-mod) is en-
dowed with the discrete topology. Consider the category A-modd of continuous
functors M : A → k-mod. We call them discrete modules following the terminology
of [DFO2, Section 1.5]. For any discrete A-module N define a Harish-Chandra
U -module                                M
                             F(N ) =           N (m).
                                       m∈Specm Γ
Furthermore, for x ∈ N (m) and a ∈ U set
                                      X
                              ax =                 an x
                                       n∈Specm Γ
                         HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES FOR YANGIANS                                         5


where an is the image of a in A(m, n). For any morphism f : M → N in the
category A-modd set                  M
                            F(f ) =        f (m).
                                              m∈Specm Γ
We thus have a functor F : A-modd → H(U, Γ).
Proposition 2.1. ( [DFO2], Theorem 17.) The functor F is an equivalence.
   We will identify a discrete A-module N with the corresponding Harish-Chandra
module F(N ). For m ∈ Specm Γ denote by m̂ the completion of m. Consider the
two-sided ideal I ⊆ A generated by the completions m̂ for all m ∈ Specm Γ and
set AW = A/I. Proposition 2.1 implies the following.
Corollary 2.2. The categories HW (U, Γ) and AW -mod are equivalent.
   The subalgebra Γ is called big in m ∈ Specm Γ if A(m, m) is finitely generated
as a left (or, equivalently, right) Γm -module.
Lemma 2.3. ( [DFO2], Corollary 19.) If Γ is big in m ∈ Specm Γ then there exist
finitely many non-isomorphic irreducible Harish-Chandra U -modules M such that
M (m) 6= 0. For any such module dim M (m) < ∞.

2.2. Special PBW algebras. Let U be an associative algebra over k endowed
with an increasing filtration {Ui }i∈Z , U−1 = {0}, U0 = k, Ui Uj ⊆ Ui+j . For
u ∈ Ui \ Ui−1 set deg u = i. Let U = gr U be the associated graded algebra
                                      M ∞
                                 U=       Ui /Ui−1 .
                                              i=0

For u ∈ U denote by u its image in U and for a subset S ⊆ U set S = {s | s ∈ S}
⊆ U . The algebra U is called a special PBW algebra if any element of U can
be written uniquely as a linear combination of ordered monomials in some fixed
generators of U and if U is a polynomial algebra. Such algebras were introduced
in [FO].
   Let Λ = k[X1 , . . . , Xn ] be a polynomial algebra. A sequence g1 , . . ., gt ∈ Λ is
called regular (in Λ) if the class of gi in Λ/(g1 , . . . , gi−1 ) is non-invertible and is not
a zero divisor for any i = 1, . . . , t.
   Next proposition contains some properties of regular sequences which will be
used in the sequel; see e.g. [BH].
Proposition 2.4.               (1) A sequence of the form X1 , . . . , Xr , G1 , . . . Gt is regular
       in Λ if and only if the sequence g1 , . . . , gt is regular in k[Xr+1 , . . . , Xn ],
       where gi (Xr+1 , . . . , Xn ) = Gi (0, . . . , 0, Xr+1 , . . . , Xn ).
   (2) A sequence g1 g1′ , g2 , . . . , gt is regular if and only if the sequences g1 , g2 , . . . , gt
       and g1′ , g2 , . . . , gt are regular.
   The following analogue of Kostant theorem [K] is valid for special PBW algebras.
Theorem 2.5. [FO] Let U be a special PBW algebra and let g1 , . . ., gt ∈ U be
mutually commuting elements such that g 1 , . . ., gt is a regular sequence in U, and
let Γ = k[g1 , . . . , gt ]. Then U is a free left (right) Γ-module. Moreover Γ is a direct
summand of U .

                                3. Freeness of Yp (gl2 ) over Γ
  Let p be a positive integer. The level p Yangian Yp (gl2 ) for the Lie algebra gl2
                                                             (1)         (p)
[C2] can be defined as the algebra over k with generators tij , . . . , tij , i, j = 1, 2,
subject to the relations
                                  1
(3.1)           [Tij (u), Tkl (v)] = (Tkj (u)Til (v) − Tkj (v)Til (u)),
                                 u−v
where u, v are formal variables and
                                                    p
                                                    X     (k)
                       Tij (u) = δij up +                 tij up−k ∈ Yp (gl2 )[u].
                                                    k=1

Explicitly, (3.1) reads
                                    min(r,s)
                   (r) (s)
                                      X           (a−1) (r+s−a)       (r+s−a) (a−1) 
                 [tij , tkl ]   =                 tkj  til         − tkj     til     ,
                                      a=1
         (0)             (r)
where   tij= δij and     = 0 for r ≥ p + 1. Note that the level 1 Yangian Y1 (gl2 )
                        tij
coincides with the universal enveloping algebra U(gl2 ). Set
                       (k)
                 deg tij = k                for    i, j = 1, 2 and k = 1, . . . , p.
This defines a natural filtration on the Yangian Yp (gl2 ). The corresponding graded
algebra will be denoted by Y p (gl2 ). We have the following analogue of the Poincaré–
Birkhoff–Witt theorem for the algebra Yp (gl2 ).
Proposition 3.1. ( [C2]; see also [M2]) Given an arbitrary linear ordering on the
                     (k)
set of generators tij , any element of the algebra Yp (gl2 ) is uniquely written as a
linear combination of ordered monomials in these generators. Moreover, the algebra
                                                 (k)
Yp (gl2 ) is a polynomial algebra in generators tij .
   Proposition 3.1 implies that Yp (gl2 ) is a special PBW algebra. Denote by D(u)
the quantum determinant
                     D(u) = T11 (u)T22 (u − 1) − T21 (u)T12 (u − 1)
                                = T11 (u − 1)T22 (u) − T12 (u − 1)T21 (u)
(3.2)
                                = T22 (u)T11 (u − 1) − T12 (u)T21 (u − 1)
                                = T22 (u − 1)T11 (u) − T21 (u − 1)T12 (u).
Clearly, D(u) is a monic polynomial in u of degree 2p,
(3.3)           D(u) = u2p + d1 u2p−1 + · · · + d2p ,                      di ∈ Yp (gl2 ).
It was shown in [C1, C2] (see also [M2] for a different proof) that the coefficients
d1 , . . . , d2p are algebraically independent generators of the center of the algebra
Yp (gl2 ). Denote by Γ the subalgebra of Yp (gl2 ) generated by the coefficients of
                                 (k)
D(u) and by the elements t22 , k = 1, . . . , p. This algebra is obviously commutative.
We will show later (Corollary 5.3) that Γ is a Harish-Chandra subalgebra in Yp (gl2 ).
                                      (1)           (p)
Lemma 3.2. The sequence t22 , . . . , t22 , d1 , . . . , d2p of the images of the generators
of Γ is regular in Yp (gl2 ).

Proof. Let us set
       (i)         (i)                                                               (i) (j)       (i) (j)
 ti = t11 + t22 ,         i = 1, . . . , p           and              ∆i,j = t11 t22 − t21 t12 ,               i, j = 1, . . . , p.
It follows from (3.3) that
                                                                      2p
                                                                      X
                                                             2p
                                                D(u) = u          +         di u2p−i ,
                                                                      i=1
with
                                          i−1
                                          X
                         di = ti +              ∆j,i−j                for      i = 1, . . . , p         and
                                          j=1
                                   p
                                   X
                         di =               ∆j,i−j                    for      i = p + 1, . . . , 2p.
                                  j=i−p
Hence we need to show that the sequence
                                                                      p−1
                                                                      X                  p
                                                                                         X
             (1)          (p)
         t22 , . . . , t22 , t1 , t2 + ∆11 , . . . , tp +                   ∆i,p−i ,            ∆i,p+1−i , . . . , ∆pp
                                                                      i=1                i=1
                                                                                                         (1)              (p)
is regular. We will denote by ∇i the result of the substitution t22 = · · · = t22 = 0
in di , i = 1, . . . , 2p. By Proposition 2.4 (1), we only need to show the regularity of
the sequence
                                         ∇1 , . . . , ∇2p .
Consider the automorphism φ of Y p (gl2 )/I given by
               (i)                        (i)      (i)            (i)          (i)
              t11 7→ ∇i ,                 t21 7→ t21 ,            t12 7→ t12 ,                 for i = 1, . . . , p,
                                                          (1)           (p)
where I is the ideal generated by                        t22 , . . . , t22 .
                                                          Since the regularity of a sequence
is preserved by automorphisms, it is sufficient to demonstrate the regularity of the
sequence
                            (1)           (p)
                           t11 , . . . , t11 , ∇p+1 , . . . , ∇2p .
                                                                             (k)
Since the elements ∇i do not depend on the t11 , Proposition 2.4 (1) implies that
this is equivalent to the regularity of the sequence ∇p+1 , . . . , ∇2p . For each pair of
indices k, l ∈ {1, . . . , p} and any index 1 ≤ a ≤ max{k, l}, consider the sequence of
a elements which occupy the rows of the table s(k, l, a) below

                                                                                                              

                           .                                                                                  
                                                                                                              

Note that when k = l = a = p the rows of the table are exactly the elements ∇i ,
i = p + 1, . . . , 2p. We will show by induction on a that the sequence of rows of

s(k, l, a) is regular. Note that s(k, l, 1) consists of the single element t21 t12 and
is obviously regular. Now let a > 1. Consider the following two tables which we
denote by s′ (k, l, a) and s′′ (k, l, a), respectively.

Due to Proposition 2.4 (2), it is sufficient to verify the regularity of both s′ (k, l, a)
                                                                  (k)
and s′′ (k, l, a). Using again Proposition 2.4 (1), substitute t21 = 0 in s′ (k, l, a)
      (k)
and t12 = 0 in s′′ (k, l, a). It is easy to see that after this substitution we obtain
the tables s(k − 1, l, a − 1) and s(k, l − 1, a − 1), respectively. By the induction
hypothesis, both of them are regular and so is s(k, l, a). In particular, the sequence
s(p, p, p) is regular which completes the proof.                                        
                                                         (1)           (p)
   Using the regularity of the sequence t22 , . . . , t22 , d1 , . . . , d2p we immediately ob-
tain the following.

Corollary 3.3. The generators t22 , . . . , t22 , d1 , . . . , d2p of Γ are algebraically in-
dependent.
    Combining Lemma 3.2 with Proposition 2.5 we obtain our first main result.
Theorem 3.4.        (1) Yp (gl2 ) is free as a left (right) module over Γ. Moreover Γ
      is a direct summand of Yp (gl2 ).
  (2) Any m ∈ Specm Γ extends to an irreducible Yp (gl2 )-module.
   For a subset P ⊆ Yp (gl2 ) denote by D(P ) the set of all x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) such that
there exists z ∈ Γ, z 6= 0 for which zx ∈ P .
Corollary 3.5. Let P ⊆ Yp (gl2 ) be a finitely generated left Γ-module then D(P ) is
a finitely generated left Γ-module.
Proof. Since Γ is a domain then D(P ) is a Γ-submodule in Yp (gl2 ). Using the fact
that Yp (gl2 ) is a free left Γ-module we conclude that Yp (gl2 ) ≃ FP ⊕ F where FP
and F are free left Γ-modules, FP has a finite rank and P ⊆ FP . Then D(P ) ⊆ FP
and hence it is finitely generated as a module over a noetherian ring.            

                     4. Harish-Chandra modules for gl2 Yangians
   In this section we introduce universal Harish-Chandra modules M (ℓ). We also
describe their structure in an explicit form in the case of generic parameters ℓ.
   Let L be a polynomial algebra in the variables b1 , . . . , bp , g1 , . . . g2p . Define a
k-homomorphism ı : Γ → L by
                       (k)
(4.1)               ı(t22 ) = σk,p (b1 , . . . , bp ),          ı(di ) = σi,2p (g1 , . . . , g2p ),
where σi,j is the i-th elementary symmetric polynomial in j variables. Due to
Corollary 3.3, ı is injective. We will identify the elements of Γ with their images
in L and treat them as polynomials in the variables b1 , . . . , bp , g1 , . . . g2p invariant
under the action of the group Sp × S2p . Set L = Specm L. We will identify L with
k3p . If
    β = (β1 , . . . , βp ),      γ = (γ1 , . . . , γ2p )             and          ℓ = (β1 , . . . , βp , γ1 , . . . , γ2p )
                         HARISH-CHANDRA MODULES FOR YANGIANS                                    9


then we shall write ℓ = (β, γ). The monomorphism ı induces the epimorphism
(4.2)                                    ı∗ : L → Specm Γ.
If ℓ ∈ L and m = ı∗ (ℓ) then D(ℓ) will denote the equivalence class of m in
∆(Yp (gl2 ), Γ); see Section 2.1.
   Let P0 ⊆ L, P0 ≃ Z p , be the lattice generated by the elements δi ∈ k3p for
i = 1, . . . , p, where
                            δi = (δi1 , . . . , δi3p ), δij = δij .
Then P0 acts on L by shifts δi (ℓ) := ℓ + δi . Furthermore, the group Sp × S2p acts on
L by permutations. Thus the semidirect product W of the groups Sp × S2p and P0
acts on L and L. Denote by S a multiplicative set in L generated by the elements
bi − bj − m for all i 6= j and all m ∈ Z and by L the localization of L by S. Note
that S is invariant under the action of W and hence W acts on L as well.
   For arbitrary 3p-tuple ℓ = (β, γ) ∈ L set
             β(u) = (u + β1 ) · · · (u + βp ),             γ(u) = (u + γ1 ) · · · (u + γ2p ).
Let Iℓ be the left ideal of Yp (gl2 ) generated by the coefficients of the polynomials
T22 (u) − β(u) and D(u) − γ(u). Define the corresponding quotient module over
Yp (gl2 ) by
(4.3)                                    M (ℓ) = Yp (gl2 )/Iℓ .
We shall call it the universal module. It follows from Theorem 3.4 that Iℓ is a
proper ideal of Yp (gl2 ) and so M (ℓ) is a non-trivial module. It is clear that if V is
an arbitrary Harish-Chandra Yp (gl2 )-module generated by a non-zero η ∈ V such
that D(u)η = γ(u)η and T22 (u)η = β(u)η then V is a homomorphic image of M (ℓ).
  Set P1 = Specm L ⊆ L, i.e. P1 consists of generic 3p-tuples ℓ = (β, γ) such that

(4.4)                            βi − βj 6∈ Z          for all i 6= j.
If ℓ ∈ P1 then the modules from the category H(Yp (gl2 ), Γ, D(ℓ)) are called generic
Harish-Chandra modules.
4.1. Weight modules. For ℓ = (β, γ) ∈ L the category HW (Yp (gl2 ), Γ, D(ℓ))
consists of finitely generated weight modules V with central character γ and with
Supp V ⊆ D(ℓ). We shall denote this category by Rℓ for brevity. If ℓ ∈ P1 then
the modules from Rℓ will be called generic weight modules.
   A Yp (gl2 )-module V is an object of Rℓ if V is a direct sum of its weight subspaces:
             M
       V =        Vℓ ,   Vℓ = {η ∈ V | T22 (u)η = β(u)η, D(u)η = γ(u)η}.
               ℓ∈L

   If V ∈ Rℓ then we shall simply write Vβ instead of Vℓ and identify Supp V with
the set of all β such that the subspace Vβ is nonzero. The next lemma describes
the action of the Yangian generators on the weight subspaces; cf. (2.1).
Lemma 4.1. Let V be a generic weight Yp (gl2 )-module and let β = (β1 , . . . , βp ) ∈
Supp V . Then
                                p
                                X                                             p
                                                                              X
(4.5)            T21 (u)Vβ ⊆           Vβ+δi         and        T12 (u)Vβ ⊆         Vβ−δi
                                 i=1                                          i=1

where β ± δi = (β1 , . . . , βi ± 1, . . . , βp ).

Proof. First we show that T21 (−βi )Vβ ⊆ Vβ+δi for all i = 1, . . . , p. Since
                             T22 (u − 1)T21 (u) = T21 (u − 1)T22 (u)
we have
                 T22 (−βi − 1)T21 (−βi ) η = T21 (−βi − 1)T22 (−βi ) η = 0
for all η ∈ Vβ . Also,
     T22 (−βj )T21 (−βi ) η = (βi − βj )−1 (T21 (−βi )T22 (−βj ) − T21 (−βj )T22 (−βi )) η
                              + T21 (−βi )T22 (−βj ) η = 0
since T22 (−βk ) η = 0 for all k = 1, . . . , p. Using the fact that βi − βj ∈     / Z we
conclude that T21 (−βi )Vβ ⊆ Vβ+δi for all i = 1, . . . , p. Since T21 (u) is a polynomial
of degree p − 1 in u and βi 6= βj if i 6= j, we thus get the first containment
of (4.5). The second is verified in the same way with the use of the identity
T22 (u)T12 (u − 1) = T12 (u)T22 (u − 1).                                                

Corollary 4.2. If V is indecomposable generic weight module over Yp (gl2 ) and
β ∈ Supp V then Supp V ⊆ β + Z p .                                           
Lemma 4.3. If V is a generic weight Yp (gl2 )-module with the central character γ
then for any β = (β1 , . . . , βp ) ∈ Supp V and any η ∈ Vβ we have
                        T12 (−βr )T21 (−βs ) η = T21 (−βs )T12 (−βr ) η,
if s 6= r, and
                          T12 (−βi − 1)T21 (−βi ) η = −γ(−βi ) η,
                          T21 (−βi + 1)T12 (−βi ) η = −γ(−βi + 1) η.
Proof. The first equality follows from the defining relations (1.1). The two remain-
ing follow from (3.2).                                                            

     The following corollary is immediate from Lemma 4.3.
Corollary 4.4. Let V be a generic weight Yp (gl2 )-module with the central character
γ and let β = (β1 , . . . , βp ) ∈ Supp V .
      (1) If γ(−βi ) 6= 0 then Ker T21 (−βi ) ∩ Vβ = 0.
      (2) If γ(−βi + 1) 6= 0 then Ker T12 (−βi ) ∩ Vβ = 0.
      (3) If V is indecomposable and γ(−βi + k) 6= 0 for all k ∈ Z then
                        Ker T21 (−ψi ) ∩ Vψ = Ker T12 (−ψi ) ∩ Vψ = 0
          for all ψ = (ψ1 , . . . , ψp ) ∈ Supp V .                                          
   Since the universal module M (ℓ) is non-trivial, the image of 1 in M (ℓ) is nonzero.
We shall denote this image by ξ. Assume that β satisfies the genericity condition
(4.4). For any (k) = (k1 , . . . , kp ) ∈ Z p define the corresponding vector of the
module M (ℓ) by
                     Y

The action of T11 (u) is found from the relation

Proof. We start by proving the formulas for the action of the generators of Yp (gl2 ).
Formula (4.7) follows by induction with the use of the relations
                                        u−v+1                    1
(4.10)           T22 (u) T21 (v) =            T21 (v) T22 (u) −     T21 (u) T22 (v)
                                         u−v                    u−v
and
                                        u−v−1                    1
(4.11)           T22 (u) T12 (v) =            T12 (v) T22 (u) +     T12 (u) T22 (v)
                                         u−v                    u−v
implied by (3.1). By Lemma 4.3 we have: if ki > 0 then
                      T21 (−βi − ki ) ξ (k) = ξ (k+δi ) ,
(4.12)
                      T12 (−βi − ki ) ξ (k) = −γ(−βi − ki + 1) ξ (k−δi ) ;
if ki < 0 then
                           T12 (−βi − ki ) ξ (k) = ξ (k−δi ) ,
(4.13)
                           T21 (−βi − ki ) ξ (k) = −γ(−βi − ki ) ξ (k+δi ) ;
and if ki = 0 then
                                        T12 (−βi ) ξ (k) = ξ (k−δi ) ,
(4.14)
                                        T21 (−βi ) ξ (k) = ξ (k+δi ) .
Applying the Lagrange interpolation formula we obtain the remaining formulas.
    It is implied by the formulas, that the module M (ℓ) is spanned by the vectors
ξ (k) . By (4.7) and the genericity assumption, the ξ (k) are eigenvectors for T22 (u)

with distinct eigenvalues. In order to verify their linear independence, suppose first
that γ(u) satisfies the condition
(4.15)             γ(−βi − k) 6= 0             for all k ∈ Z       and all i.
                                                       (k)
In this case the linear independence of the ξ     follows from the fact that each of
them is nonzero. This is implied by (4.12)–(4.13) since ξ 6= 0 in M (ℓ).
                                                                 f(ℓ) as follows. As
    In the case of general γ(u) let us define a Yp (gl2 )-module M
                  f                                             e(k)
a vector space, M (ℓ) is the k-linear span of the basis vectors ξ with (k) running
over Z p and the action of Yp (gl2 ) is given by the formulas (4.7)–(4.9), where the
ξ (k) should be replaced with ξe(k) . We have to verify that the operators Tij (u) do
satisfy the Yangian defining relations (3.1). However, the application of both sides
of (3.1) to a basis vector ξe(k) amounts to polynomial relations on the coefficients
of γ(u). By the previous argument, if γ(u) satisfies (4.15) then these relations are
identities. Therefore, these identities remain hold for an arbitrary γ(u) and thus
f(ℓ) is well defined.
M
    Finally, consider the Yp (gl2 )-module homomorphism
                                             f(ℓ),
                             ϕ : Yp (gl2 ) → M               1 7→ ξe(0) .
Obviously, the ideal Iℓ is contained in the kernel Ker ϕ and so, this defines a homo-
morphism M (ℓ) → M    f(ℓ) which takes ξ (k) to the corresponding vector ξe(k) . Since
            e
the vectors ξ (k)                 f(ℓ) this proves that the vectors ξ (k) are linearly
                  form a basis of M
independent.                                                                        

   Let us fix a p-tuple β satisfying the genericity condition (4.4) and introduce the
elements of Yp (gl2 ) by
                       Y
              τ (k) =      T21 (−βi − ki + 1) · · · T21 (−βi − 1) T21 (−βi )
                       i, ki >0
                         Y
                   ×              T12 (−βi − ki − 1) · · · T12 (−βi + 1) T12 (−βi ),
                       i, ki <0

where (k) runs over Z p .
Corollary 4.6. The elements τ (k) are linearly independent over Γ in the right
Γ-module Yp (gl2 ).
Proof. Suppose that a linear combination of the elements τ (k) with coefficients in
Γ is zero:
                          X
(4.16)                       τ (k) c(k) = 0,  c(k) ∈ Γ.
                                  (k)

Apply the left hand side to the vector ξ in a module M (ℓ) with ℓ = (β, γ) satisfying
the assumptions of Theorem 4.5. We get the relation
                                 X
                                    c(k) (ℓ) ξ (k) = 0,
                                         (k)

where c(k) (ℓ) is the evaluation of the polynomial c(k) at T22 (u) = β(u) and D(u) =
γ(u). Since the vectors ξ (k) form a basis of M (ℓ) this implies that c(k) (ℓ) = 0 for any
choice of the parameters γ. Therefore, each c(k) does not depend on the generators

                                      (i)
di and so it is a polynomial in the t22 . However, due to the Poincaré–Birkhoff–
Witt theorem for the algebra Yp (gl2 ) (Proposition 3.1), a nontrivial relation (4.16)
can only hold if the elements τ (k) are linearly dependent over k. But this is not
the case because the vectors ξ (k) = τ (k) ξ are linearly independent in M (ℓ) by
Theorem 4.5.                                                                        
Remark 4.7. One can also produce a family of Γ-linearly independent elements for
the left Γ-module Yp (gl2 ). They can be obtained as images of the τ (k) under the
anti-automorphism of the algebra Yp (gl2 ) given by
                                      (r)    (r)
(4.17)                               tij 7→ tji .
For the proof we observe that every generator of Γ is stable under this anti-
automorphism. With the exception of the case p = 1, the elements τ (k) do not
apparently constitute a basis of Yp (gl2 ) as a right Γ-module.
Remark 4.8. Given two monic polynomials α(u) and β(u) of degree p define the cor-
responding Verma module V (α(u), β(u)) as the quotient of Yp (gl2 ) by the left ideal
generated by the coefficients of the polynomials T11 (u) − α(u), T22 (u) − β(u) and
T12 (u); cf. [T1, T2]. Then the same argument as above shows that V (α(u), β(u))
has a basis {ξ (k) } parameterized by p-tuples of nonnegative integers (k). The for-
mulas of Theorem 4.5 hold for the basis vectors ξ (k) , where γ(u) should be taken
to be α(u) β(u − 1) which defines the central character γ of V (α(u), β(u)). In fact,
V (α(u), β(u)) is isomorphic to the quotient of the corresponding universal module
M (ℓ), ℓ = (β, γ) by the submodule spanned by the vectors {ξ (k) } such that (k)
contains at least one negative component ki .
Corollary 4.9. Let ℓ = (β, γ) ∈ P1 .
   (1) The module M (ℓ) is a generic weight Yp (gl2 )-module with central character
       γ, Supp M (ℓ) = Z p and all weight spaces are 1-dimensional.
   (2) The module M (ℓ) has a unique maximal submodule and hence a unique
       irreducible quotient.
   (3) The equivalence class D(ℓ) coincides with the set ℓ + P0 .
Proof. Statement (1) follows immediately from Theorem 4.5. The sum of all proper
submodules of M (ℓ) is again a proper submodule implying (2). The statement (3)
follows immediately from (1).                                                 
   We will denote the unique irreducible quotient of M (ℓ) by L(ℓ). It follows from
Corollary 4.9 that all weight spaces of L(ℓ) are 1-dimensional. We can now describe
all irreducible generic weight Yp (gl2 )-modules.
Corollary 4.10. Let ℓ = (β, γ) ∈ P1 .
   (1) There exists an irreducible generic weight Yp (gl2 )-module L(ℓ) with L(ℓ)β 6=
       0 and with central character γ. Moreover, dim L(ℓ)ψ = 1 for all ψ ∈
       Supp L(ℓ).
   (2) Any irreducible weight module over Yp (gl2 ) with central character γ gener-
       ated by a nonzero vector of weight β is isomorphic to L(ℓ).

                    5. Γ is a Harish-Chandra subalgebra
  In this section we adapt the results from [DFO2] and [Ov] for the Yangians. In
particular, we show that Γ is a Harish-Chandra subalgebra.
14        VYACHESLAV FUTORNY, ALEXANDER MOLEV, AND SERGE OVSIENKO


   We have the following analogue of the Harish-Chandra theorem for Lie algebras
[Di].
Proposition 5.1. Let x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) be such that xM (ℓ) = 0 for any ℓ ∈ P1 . Then
x = 0.
Proof.
T      Since M (ℓ) = Yp (gl2 )/Iℓ it will be sufficient to show that the intersection
    I
  ℓ ℓ over all ℓ ∈ P1 is zero. By Theorem 3.4 (1), the Yangian Yp (gl2 ) isPfree as a
right module over Γ. Let xi , i ∈ I be a basis of Yp (gl2 ) over Γ. If x = i∈I xi zi
for some zi ∈ Γ then x ∈ Iℓ if and only if zi (ℓ) = 0 for all iT∈ I. Since P1 is dense
in L in Zariski topology it follows immediately that if x ∈ ℓ Iℓ then zi = 0 for all
i ∈ I and thus x = 0. This completes the proof.                                     
   For any ℓ0 ∈ P1 the module M (ℓ0 ) has a basis ξ (k) , (k) ∈ Z p with the action
of generators of Y(gl2 ) defined by formulas (4.7)–(4.9). We will relabel the basis
elements of M (ℓ0 ) as ξℓ , ℓ ∈ ℓ0 + P0 . It follows from Theorem 4.5 that for every
x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) there exists a finite subset Lx ⊆ P0 consisting of elements δ such that
                                                 X
(5.1)                                x ξℓ =              θ(x, ℓ, δ) ξℓ+δ
                                                δ∈Lx

for some nonzero coefficients θ(x, ℓ, δ) ∈ k. We can also regard these coeffi-
cients as the values of the rational functions θ(x, b, δ) ∈ L at b = ℓ, where
b = (b1 , . . . , bp , g1 , . . . , g2p ). Clearly, the set Lx is Sp × S2p -invariant. Note that for
a given x this formula does not depend on ℓ0 .
   We identify the (Γ−Γ)-bimodule structure on Yp (gl2 ) with the corresponding
Γ ⊗ Γ-module structure. For any z ∈ Γ and any finite S ⊆ L introduce the following
polynomial

                                                                           |S|

        FS,z = FS,z (z, b) =         (z ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ z(b + δ)) =                      z i ⊗ ai ,       ai ∈ L.

                                                        i=0
     (1) ai ∈ Γ, i = 0, . . . , q.

                                                                              X
     (2) For any x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) such that Lx ⊆ S we have                              z i xai = 0.
                                                                              i=0

Proof. Since S is Sp × S2p -invariant, the coefficients of the polynomial FS,z are
Sp × S2p -invariant and hence belong to Γ which proves (1). It is sufficient to check
the statement (2) for S = Lx since FS,z = FS\Lx ,z FLx ,z . Let ℓ ∈ P1 and let ξℓ be
a basis element of M (ℓ). Then

  The main result of this section is the following theorem.

Theorem 5.3. Γ is a Harish-Chandra subalgebra of Yp (gl2 ).

Proof. Following [DFO2, Proposition 8], it is sufficient to show that a Γ-bimodule
   (k)
Γ tij Γ is finitely generated both as left and as right module for every possible
                                                                                         (k)
choice of indices i, j, k. This is obvious for i = j = 2 since t22 ∈ Γ. Suppose now
                                    (k)      (k)
that i = 2, j = 1. We have di t21 = t21 di by the centrality of di . It follows from
                                                          (k)
(4.8) that Lt(k) = {δi | i = 1, . . . , p}. Then for x = t21 we have

                                                           l=0

and
                                                         p−1

(5.2)                                 (t22 )p t21 +         (t22 )l t21 al = 0
                                                         l=0

by Proposition 5.2 (2). Hence the elements
                                       p
                                       Y   (i)     (k)

                                       i=1

                             (k)
are generators of Γt21 Γ as a right Γ-module. The cases i = 1, j = 2 and i = j = 1
are treated similarly since

        Lt(k) = {−δi | i = 1, . . . , p}                and          Lt(k) = { δi − δj | i, j = 1, . . . , p}.
          12                                                           11


               (k)
Thus, Γtij Γ is finitely generated as a right Γ-module. The claim for the left
module is proved by the application of the anti-automorphism of the algebra Yp (gl2 )
defined in (4.17) where we note that every element of Γ is stable under this anti-
automorphism.                                                                     

Example 5.4. We give an explicit form of the relation (5.2) for the particular case
i = k = p = 2. It reads
                                                                  

                    6. Universal representation of the Yangian
   We will denote by K(Γ) the field of fractions of Γ.
   Let MP0 (L) be the ring of locally finite matrices over L (with a finite number of
non-zero elements in each row and each column) with the entries indexed by the
elements of P0 . Any ℓ ∈ P1 defines the evaluation homomorphism χℓ : L → k,
which induces the homomorphism of matrix algebras Φ(ℓ) : MP0 (L) → MP0 (k).
For ℓ, ℓ′ ∈ P0 denote by eℓ ℓ′ the corresponding matrix unit in MP0 (L). The group
W acts on MP0 (L) by the rule: if X = (Xℓ ℓ′ )ℓ,ℓ′ ∈P0 then
(6.3)                 (w−1 · X)ℓ,ℓ′ = w−1 · Xw(ℓ)w(ℓ′ )               for   w ∈ W.
     Define the map
                                G : Yp (gl2 ) → MP0 (L)
such that for any x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) and any ℓ ∈ P0 , G(x)ℓ ℓ′ = θ(x, b + ℓ, δ) if ℓ′ − ℓ = δ
and 0 otherwise; see (5.1).
Lemma 6.1.       (1) G is a representation of Yp (gl2 ).
  (2) G(x) is W-invariant for any x ∈ Yp (gl2 ). In particular, G(x)0 0 ∈ K(Γ).
  (3) If x = x(b1 , . . . , bp , g1 , . . . , g2p ) ∈ Γ and ℓ = (l1 , . . . , lp , 0, . . . , 0) ∈ P0 then
                         G(x)ℓℓ = x(b1 + l1 , . . . , bp + lp , g1 , . . . , g2p ).
      (4) G(Γ) consists of W-invariant diagonal matrices X such that X0 0 ∈ Γ. In
          particular, any such matrix X is determined by X0 0 ∈ Γ.
                                                              (k)
Proof. Let T be the free associative algebra with generators e
                                                             tij , where i, j = 1, 2
and k = 1, . . . , p, and let
                                                            e(k)    (k)
                                π : T → Yp (gl2 ),          tij 7→ tij ,
                                                                         (k)
be the canonical projection. Define a homomorphism g : T → MP0 (L) by g(e
                                                                        tij ) =
     (k)
G(tij ) for all suitable i, j, k. To prove (1) it is sufficient to show that g(Ker π) = 0.
Suppose that f ∈ Ker π. Then Φ(ℓ)(g(f )) = 0 and thus g(f )ℓ′ ℓ′′ (ℓ) = 0 for any
ℓ ∈ P1 . Since P1 is dense in Specm L we conclude that g(f ) = 0 implying (1).
The image of G is W-invariant since this holds for the generators of Yp (gl2 ); see
(4.7)–(4.9). For any σ ∈ Sp × S2p we have
                    (σ −1 · G)(x)0 0 = σ −1 (G(x)σ(0) σ(0) ) = σ −1 (G(x)0 0 ).
Hence G(x)0 0 is Sp × S2p -invariant proving (2). The statement (3) follows from
(2) if we apply a shift by ℓ ∈ P0 to an arbitrary x ∈ Yp (gl2 ). The statement (4)
follows immediately from (2) and (3).                                           
   The composition rℓ = Φ(ℓ) ◦ G defines a representation of Yp (gl2 ). By the
construction, this representation provides a matrix realization of the module M (ℓ);
see Theorem 4.5.
Proposition 6.2. The representation G : Yp (gl2 )−→ MP0 (L) is faithful.
Proof. It is clear that                              \
                                        Ker G ⊆            Ker rℓ .
                                                    ℓ∈P1
Hence it is sufficient to prove that the intersection of the kernels is zero. Let ℓ ∈ P1 .
Then
T     Ker rℓ = Ann M (ℓ) by definition and so Ker rℓ ⊆ Iℓ . However, the intersection
 ℓ Iℓ over all ℓ ∈ P1 is zero, as was shown in the proof of Proposition 5.1.           

Corollary 6.3.       (1) Γ is a maximal commutative subalgebra in Yp (gl2 ).
   (2) If for x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) the matrix G(x) is diagonal then x ∈ Γ.
Proof. Consider an element x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) which commutes with every z ∈ Γ and such
that x ∈/ Γ. Suppose that there exist ℓ, ℓ′ ∈ P0 , ℓ 6= ℓ′ such that G(x)ℓℓ′ 6= 0. There
exists z ∈ Γ such that z(ℓ) 6= z(ℓ′ ) and so G(z)ℓℓ 6= G(z)ℓ′ ℓ′ by Lemma 6.1 (3). Then
we have
               G(xz)ℓℓ′ = G(x)ℓℓ′ G(z)ℓ′ ℓ′ = G(zx)ℓℓ′ = G(z)ℓℓ G(x)ℓℓ′
which contradicts to the assumption. Therefore G(x) is diagonal. To prove the max-
imality of Γ it is now sufficient to verify part (2) of the corollary. By Lemma 6.1 (2),
we have G(x)0 0 = f /g ∈ K(Γ) with relatively prime f, g ∈ Γ. Suppose that g 6∈ k.
By Lemma 6.1 (2) and (4), we derive that G(x)G(g) = G(f ) and hence xg = f by
Proposition 6.2. This shows that x ∈ Γ due to Theorem 3.4 (1).                        

  Denote by X0 the column matrix defined by
                                   X
                            X0 =        L eδ,0 ,
                                              δ∈P0

where 0 is the zero element of P0 . Note that the W-action (6.3) induces an action
of Sp × S2p on the free L-module X0 .
Corollary 6.4. Let p : MP0 (L)→ X0 be the natural projection. Then the compo-
sition r = p ◦ G : Yp (gl2 ) → X0 is injective. Moreover, the map p commutes with
the action of Sp × S2p and, in particular, r(Yp (gl2 )) is Sp × S2p -invariant.
Proof. Note that for any x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) the matrix G(x) ∈ MP0 (L) is determined
completely by its column p(G(x)). Thus r(x) = 0 implies G(x) = 0 and hence
x = 0 since G is faithful. This proves that r is injective. The other statements
follow immediately from the definitions and Lemma 6.1 (2).                    

   As in Section 5, we identify the (Γ−Γ)-bimodule structure on Yp (gl2 ) with the
corresponding action of Γ ⊗ Γ. Using the embedding (4.1), we can regard the
elements of Γ ⊗ Γ as polynomials in two families of variables b and b′ which are
Sp × S2p -invariant.
Lemma 6.5. Suppose that x ∈ Yp (gl2 ), f ∈ Γ ⊗ Γ, and ℓ, ℓ′ ∈ P0 . Then

                     G(f · x)ℓℓ′ = f (b + ℓ, b + ℓ′ )G(x)ℓℓ′ .
                P                                        P
Proof. Let f = i zi ⊗ zi′ ∈ Γ ⊗ Γ. Then G(f · x) = i G(zi )G(x)G(zi′ ) and hence,
by Lemma 6.1 (4),
                  X                                            X

Lemma 6.6. Let S ⊆ L be an Sp × S2p -invariant set. Suppose that z ∈ Γ and
x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) is such that G(x)ℓ ℓ′ = 0 for all ℓ, ℓ′ , ℓ − ℓ′ 6∈ S. Then FS,z · x = 0.

                          P
Proof. Let F = FS,z =        i   z i ⊗ ai with ai ∈ L. If ℓ − ℓ′ ∈ S then
                       G(F · x)ℓℓ′ = F (z(b + ℓ), b + ℓ′ ) G(x)ℓ ℓ′
by Proposition 5.2(1) and Lemma 6.5. Furthermore, observe that h(z, b) = z ⊗ 1 −
1 ⊗ z(b + ℓ − ℓ′) divides F and that h(z(b + ℓ), b + ℓ′) = 0. Here we regard the result
of the evaluation of the product of type z ⊗ z ′ (b′ ) at b as the polynomial z(b)z ′ (b′ ).
This gives F (z(b + ℓ), b + ℓ′ ) = 0. Hence, G(F · x) = 0 implying F · x = 0 by
Proposition 6.2.                                                                         
   Let S ⊆ P0 be a finite Sp ×S2p -invariant set. Define YS = {x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) | Lx ⊆ S}.
Clearly YS is a Γ-subbimodule of Yp (gl2 ). We have the following characterization
of the bimodule YS .
Lemma 6.7. Let x ∈ Yp (gl2 ). Then
  (1) x ∈ YS if and only if the condition G(x)ℓ,ℓ′ 6= 0, for some ℓ, ℓ′ ∈ P0 ,
      implies that ℓ − ℓ′ ∈ S.
  (2) FLx \S,z · x ∈ YS for any z ∈ Γ.
  (3) YS is a finitely generated left (right) Γ-module and YS = D(YS ).
  (4) Y{0} = Γ.
Proof. The statement (1) follows from the definition of YS . Let F = FLx \S,z and
y = F ·x. To prove (2) calculate the matrix element G(y)ℓℓ′ provided that ℓ−ℓ′ 6∈ S.
By Lemma 6.5,
                  G(y)ℓℓ′ = G(F · x)ℓℓ′ = F (z(b + ℓ), b + ℓ′ )G(x)ℓℓ′ .
If ℓ − ℓ′ 6∈ Lx then G(x)ℓℓ′ = 0 and hence G(y)ℓℓ′ = 0. Suppose now that ℓ − ℓ′ ∈
Lx \ S. Then
                                      Y
              F (z(b + ℓ), b + ℓ′ ) =   (z(b + ℓ) − z(b + ℓ′ + δ)) = 0.
                                        δ∈Lx \S

This proves (2).
   Let x ∈ D(YS ) and suppose that z ∈ Γ is such that z 6= 0 and zx ∈ YS . Since
G(zx)ℓℓ′ = z(b + ℓ)G(x)ℓℓ′ by Lemma 6.5, we have G(zx)ℓℓ′ = 0 if and only if
G(x)ℓℓ′ = 0 implying that x ∈ YS . Hence YS = D(YS ).
   Consider r(YS ) as a Γ-submodule of X0 where r : Yp (gl2 ) → P  X0 is defined
in Corollary 6.4. Then r(YS ) belongs to the free L-submodule        ℓ∈S Leℓ 0 of
X0 of finite rank. Hence L · r(YS ) is finitely generated L-module. Without
loss of generality we can assume that this module is generated by the elements
r(x1 ), . . . , r(xs ) ∈ r(YS ). Since D(YS ) = YS we have

Fix x ∈ Y . Then

Note that for any y ∈ YS and any σ ∈ Sp × S2p we have σ · r(y) = r(y) since S is
Sp × S2p -invariant. Hence

which can be rewritten as

Since each ui is Sp × S2p -invariant, it belongs to the field of fractions K(Γ) for all
i = 1, . . . , s. Multiplying both parts of (6.4) by the common denominator of the ui
we obtain from Corollary 6.4 that

Due to Corollary 3.5, we can conclude that YS is finitely generated over Γ. This
proves (3). By the definition of YS , x ∈ Y{0} if and only if G(x) is diagonal. Hence
x ∈ Γ by Corollary 6.3 (2).                                                        

                  7. Category of Harish-Chandra modules
   We will show in this section that each character of Γ extends to a finite number
of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over Yp (gl2 ). This is an analogue of the
corresponding result in the case of a Lie algebra gln which was conjectured in
[DFO1] and proved in [Ov]. In this section we use the techniques of [DFO2] and
[Ov].
   Since Γ is a Harish-Chandra subalgebra of Yp (gl2 ) we can apply all the state-
ments from Section 2.1. Set A = AYp (gl2 ),Γ . Then by Proposition 2.1, the categories
A-modd and H(Yp (gl2 ), Γ) are equivalent. Also the full subcategory HW (Yp (gl2 ), Γ)
consisting of weight modules is equivalent to the module category AW -mod. If
ℓ ∈ L then the category Rℓ = HW (Yp (gl2 ), Γ, D(ℓ)) is equivalent to the block
AW (D(ℓ))-mod of the category AW -mod.
   Let m, n ∈ Specm Γ, ℓm , ℓn ∈ L are such that ı∗ (ℓm ) = m and ı∗ (ℓn ) = n; see
(4.2). Set
                S(m, n) = {σ1 ℓn − σ2 ℓm | σ1 , σ2 ∈ Sp × S2p } ∩ P0 .
Consider the following subset in L
                P2 = {ℓ ∈ L | ℓi − ℓj 6∈ Z \ {0},       i, j = 1, . . . , p}
and put Ω = ı∗ (P2 ). We shall also be using the set A(m, n) introduced in (2.2).
Proposition 7.1.         (1) For any m, n ∈ Specm Γ and any m, n ≥ 0 we have
                      Yp (gl2 ) = YS + nn Yp (gl2 ) + Yp (gl2 )mm ,
        where S = S(m, n).
    (2) A(m, n) is finitely generated as a left Γn -module and as a right Γm -module.
        In particular, the algebra Γ is big in every n ∈ Ob A.
    (3) If S(m, n) = {0} then A(m, n) is generated as a left Γn -module and as a
        right Γm -module by the image of 1 in A(m, n).
    (4) If S(m, m) = {0} then m ∈ Ω. Moreover, A(m, m) is a quotient algebra
        of Γm and m extends uniquely to an irreducible Yp (gl2 )-module.
    (5) If ℓm ∈ P1 then A(m, m) = Γm .
    (6) Let ℓ ∈ P1 , m = ı∗ (ℓ) and n = ı∗ (ℓ + δi ), i ∈ {1, . . . , p}. Then A(m, n) is
        a free of rank 1 as a right Γm -module and as a left Γn -module.

Proof. (1) We shall show that for any x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) and any k > 1 there exists xk ∈
YS such that

                                              k
                                              X
(7.1)                            x ∈ xk +           nk−i xmi .
                                              i=0

The statement will follow if we choose k = m + n + 1. We will use induction on
k. Suppose that k = 1. If Lx ⊆ S then x ∈ YS and there is nothing to prove.
Furthermore, by the definition of the set S for any ℓ ∈ Lx \ S the Sp × S2p -orbits
of ℓn and ℓm + ℓ are disjoint. Hence there exists z ∈ Γ such that z(ℓn ) 6= z(ℓm + ℓ)
for any ℓ ∈ Lx \ S. Let F = FLx \S,z . Then
                                    Y
                  F (z(ℓn ), ℓm ) =      (z(ℓn ) − z(ℓm + ℓ)) 6= 0.
                                    ℓ∈Lx \S

We can assume that F (z(ℓn ), ℓm ) = 1. Hence we obtain that F = 1 + u where
u ∈ n ⊗ Γ+ Γ ⊗ m. It follows from Lemma 6.7 (2), that x1 = F · x belongs to YS .
Hence we have
     x1 = (1 + u) · x ∈ x + n x Γ + Γ x m           and thus        x ∈ x1 + n x Γ + Γ x m.
This proves the assertion in the case k = 1. Assume that (7.1) holds for some k ≥ 1.
Then
             k
             X            k
                          X                     k

                                                          X
Since YS is a Γ-bimodule we conclude that xk +                  nk−i xk mi ⊆ YS which implies
                                                          i=0
the statement (1). In particular, we have proved that
                                               k
                                               X

                                               i=0

   (2) We prove the statement for the case of left module, the case of right module
can be treated analogously. By (1) the image x of every x ∈ YS in A(n, m) is

Rk = min{[k/2], d[k/2] }. We have
                                          ∞
                                          X

Note that the first sum is well defined since Rk → ∞ when k → ∞. We conclude
that A(n, m) is finitely generated as a left Γn -module. This completes the proof of
(2).
   (3) By Lemma 6.7 (4), Y{ 0} = Γ. Hence A(m, n) is generated (both as a left
and as a right module) by the image of 1 ∈ Γ by (1).
   (4) By (3), A(m, m) is 1-generated as a left Γm -module. Then the k-algebra
homomorphism
                        ı̂m : Γm →A(m, m),        z 7→ z · 1m ,
where 1m is a unit morphism, is an epimorphism which shows that A(m, m) is a
quotient algebra of Γm . The uniqueness of the extension follows from the uniqueness
of the simple A(m, m)-module and [DFO2, Theorem 18].
   (5) Let ℓ = ℓm ∈ P1 . Then S(m, m) = ∅ and A(m, m) ≃ Γm /Jm by (4) and thus
Jm acts trivially on M (m) in any Harish-Chandra module M . Since ℓ ∈ P1 then for
                                                                k
any k > 0 there exists a canonical projection π̃k : L−→ L/(ℓ) , where (ℓ)k = ℓk L.
                                                                                  k
It induces a homomorphism of the matrix algebras πk : MP0 (L) −→ MP0 (L/(ℓ) )
and defines a Harish-Chandra module by the following composition
                              G                   π
                                             k
                   Yp (gl2 )−−−−−→MP0 (L) −−−− −→ MP0 (L/(ℓ)k ).
For any nonzero x ∈ Γ there exists k > 0 such that x 6∈ (ℓ)k and hence πk (G(x)0,0 ) =
x + (ℓ)k 6= 0. Therefore, there exists a Harish-Chandra module M where x acts
nontrivially on M (m) implying that Jm = 0. This completes the proof.
   (6) The proof is analogous to the proof of (5). Let z ∈ Γ, z 6= 0. Suppose
A(m, n)z = 0. Then by the construction of the equivalence F : A-modd −→ H(U, Γ)
for any Harish-Chandra module M and any x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) the linear operator xz on
M induces the zero map between M (m) and M (n). It is sufficient to construct
a Harish-Chandra module where this is failed. For k ≥ 1 consider as in (5) the
composition πk ◦ G : Yp (gl2 ) → MP0 (L/(ℓ)k ). It defines a Harish-Chandra module
structure on a free L/(ℓ)k -module
                                     X
                                X=        L/(ℓ)k eδ,0 .
                                        δ∈P0

Consider x ∈ Yp (gl2 ) such that G(x)δi 0 6= 0 for some i. Then
                    G(xz)δi 0 = G(x)δi 0 G(z)00 = G(x)δi 0 z 6= 0.
Choose k such that G(xz)δi 0 6∈ (ℓ)k . Hence (πk · G)(xz)δi ,0 6= 0 and the linear
operator xz induces a non-zero map between X(m) = L/(ℓ)k and X(n) = L/(ℓ +
δi )k . The contradiction shows that A(m, n)z 6= 0. The case zA(m, n) = 0 is treated
in a similar manner.                                                              
  Now we are in a position to state the main result of this section which follows
immediately from Lemma 2.3 and Proposition 7.1 (2).

Theorem 7.2. Let m ∈ Specm Γ. Then the left ideal Yp (gl2 )m is contained in
finitely many maximal left ideals of Yp (gl2 ). In particular, m extends to a finitely
many (up to an isomorphism) irreducible Yp (gl2 )-modules and for each such module
M , dim M (n) < ∞ for all n ∈ Specm Γ.

                 8. Category of generic Harish-Chandra modules
   In this section we study a full subcategory of generic modules in HW (Yp (gl2 ), Γ).
We give a complete description of irreducible modules and indecomposable modules
in tame blocks of this category.
Lemma 8.1. Let ℓ ∈ P1 , ℓ = (β, γ), m = ı∗ (ℓ) ∈ Specm Γ, n = ı∗ (ℓ + δi ),
i ∈ {1, . . . , p}. If βi 6∈ {γ1 , . . . , γ2p } then the objects of A represented by m and n
are isomorphic.
Proof. Choose z1 , z2 ∈ Γ such that
             z1 (ℓ + δj ) = δij ,        z2 (ℓ + δi − δj ) = δij ,           j = 1, . . . , p.
             (1)     (1)
Set z = z2 t12 z1 t21 . Then G(z) is diagonal by Lemma 6.5 and hence z ∈ Γ by
Corollary 6.3 (2). We will show that the image of z in Γm is invertible. Clearly,
this is equivalent to the fact that z(ℓ) 6= 0. Formulas (4.7)–(4.9) imply that
z(ℓ) = γ(−βi ) 6= 0 by assumption. Denote by T1 (respectively T2 ) the genera-
tor of Γm − Γn (respectively, Γn − Γm )-bimodule A(m, n) (respectively, A(n, m));
see Proposition 7.1 (6). Then
                                  (1)                        (1)    ′
                              z2 t12 = zm T2 ,         z1 t21 = T1 zm
                ′                                ′
for some zm , zm   ∈ Γm and hence z = zm T2 T1 zm  . Since z(ℓ) 6= 0 it follows that
  ′                                      −1    ′ −1
zm (ℓ) 6= 0, zm (ℓ) 6= 0 and so T2 T1 = zm z(zm ) is invertible in Γm . A similar
argument shows that T1 T2 is invertible in Γn . Therefore the objects m and n are
isomorphic.                                                                       

Corollary 8.2. Let ℓ ∈ P1 , ℓ = (β, γ), βi − γj 6∈ Z for all i, j. Then the category
H(Yp (gl2 ), Γ, D(ℓ)) is hereditary. Moreover,
                           dim Ext1H(Yp (gl2 ),Γ,D(ℓ)) (L(ℓ), L(ℓ)) = 3p.

Proof. Let m = ı∗ (ℓ) ∈ Specm Γ. By Lemma 8.1 and our assumptions all objects
of the category A(D(ℓ)) are isomorphic and hence the category A(D(ℓ))-modd
is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional modules over Γm . Applying
Proposition 2.1 we conclude that the category H(Yp (gl2 ), Γ, D(ℓ)) is hereditary.
Since Γm is an algebra of power series in 3p variables the statement about dim Ext1
follows.                                                                         

8.1. Category of generic weight modules. Let us fix
      ℓ ∈ P1 ,      m = ı∗ (ℓ),         n = ı∗ (ℓ + δi ) ∈ Specm Γ,                i ∈ {1, . . . , p}.
Then AW (m, m) ≃ Γm /Γm m ≃ k by Proposition 7.1 (5) and so, dim AW (m, n) = 1
by Proposition 7.1 (6). We will give a direct construction of the category AW (D(ℓ)).
   We shall keep the notation
         ℓ = (β, γ),         β = (β1 , . . . , βp ) ∈ kp ,         γ = (γ1 , . . . , γ2p ) ∈ k2p .

Since ℓ ∈ P1 then βi − βj ∈/ Z for i 6= j. Consider the following category Kℓ :
Ob (Kℓ ) = Z p and the morphisms are generated by
               fi (k) : (k) 7→ (k + δi )     and         ei (k) : (k) 7→ (k − δi ),
                                                     p
where i = 1, . . . , p and (k) = (k1 , . . . , kp ) ∈ Z with the following relations:
                   fj (k + δi ) fi (k) = fi (k + δj ) fj (k),
                   ej (k − δi ) ei (k) = ei (k − δj ) ej (k),
                   ei (k + δj ) fj (k) = fj (k − δi ) ei (k)      for i 6= j,
                    ei (k + δi ) fi (k) = −γ(−βi − ki ) 1(k) ,
                    fi (k − δi ) ei (k) = −γ(−βi − ki + 1) 1(k) .
It follows immediately from Lemmas 4.1 and 4.3 that any module in the category Rℓ
can be naturally viewed as a module over the category Kℓ which defines a functor
F : Rℓ → Kℓ -mod. Consider the cyclic subalgebra Cℓ (a) = HomKℓ (a, a) for any
a ∈ Z p . Clearly, Cℓ (a) ≃ k for any a ∈ Z p due to the defining relations of Kℓ . For
any a = (k1 , . . . , kp ) ∈ Z p we can construct a universal module M (ℓ, a) ∈ Kℓ -mod.
Consider k as a Cℓ (a)-module with
                          ei (k + δi ) fi (k) 1 = −γ(−βi − ki ),
                          fi (k − δi ) ei (k) 1 = −γ(−βi − ki + 1).
Let Aℓ,a be an algebra of paths in Kℓ originating in a. Now construct a Z p -graded
Kℓ -module
                             M (ℓ, a) = Aℓ,a ⊗Cℓ (a) k.
Clearly, all graded components of M (ℓ, a) are 1-dimensional and M (ℓ, a)a = 1a ⊗ k.
A module M (ℓ, a) contains a unique maximal Z p -graded submodule which inter-
sects M (ℓ, a)a trivially and hence has a unique irreducible quotient L(ℓ, a) with
L(ℓ, a)a ≃ k and dim L(ℓ, a)b ≤ 1 for all b ∈ Z p . If V is another irreducible Kℓ -
module with Va 6= 0 then there exists a non-trivial Cℓ (a)-homomorphism from k
to Va which can be extended to an epimorphism from M (ℓ, a) to V . Since V is
irreducible we conclude that V ≃ L(ℓ, a).
   Obviously, we can view M (ℓ) as a module over the category Kℓ with a natural
action of the morphisms of Kℓ and F (M (ℓ)) = M (ℓ, β). Thus a Kℓ -module M (ℓ, β)
can be extended to a Yp (gl2 )-module M (ℓ). Moreover, the functor F preserves the
submodule structure of M (ℓ). In particular, F (L(ℓ)) = L(ℓ, β).
Proposition 8.3. If ℓ ∈ P1 then the categories Kℓ -mod and Rℓ are equivalent.
Proof. Let ℓ = (β, γ). We already have the functor F : Rℓ → Kℓ -mod. Suppose
that V ∈ Kℓ -mod. We want to show that V can be extended to a Yp (gl2 )-module.
Fix v ∈ V(k) \ {0}. Let W ⊆ V be a submodule generated by v. Then W(k) = kv
and there is an epimorphism from M (ℓ, a) to W , where a = (k1 , . . . , kp ), which
maps 1a ⊗ 1 to v. Since F (M (ℓ′ )) = M (ℓ, a), where ℓ′ = (β + a, γ), then W can be
extended to a corresponding quotient of M (ℓ′ ). Since v was an arbitrary element
of V we conclude that V can be extended to a Yp (gl2 )-module and will denote
that module by G(V ). Clearly, G defines a functor from Kℓ -mod to Rℓ (action on
morphisms is obvious). One can easily see that the functors F and G define an
equivalence between the categories Kℓ -mod and Rℓ .                               

8.2. Support of irreducible generic weight modules. To complete the classi-
fication of irreducible modules we have to know when two irreducible modules L(ℓ)
and L(ℓ′ ) are isomorphic. For that we need to describe the support Supp L(ℓ).
   We shall say that the weight subspaces M (ℓ)ψ and M (ℓ)ψ+δi are strongly iso-
morphic if γ(−ψi ) 6= 0 where ψ = (ψ1 , . . . , ψp ). This implies

       fi (ψ1 , . . . , ψp ) M (ℓ)ψ 6= 0 and ei (ψ1 , . . . , ψi + 1, . . . , ψp ) M (ℓ)ψ+δi 6= 0.

  The statement below follows immediately from the relations in Kℓ (cf. also
Corollary 4.4).

Lemma 8.4. If M (ℓ)ψ and M (ℓ)ψ+δi are strongly isomorphic, then M (ℓ)ψ±δj
and M (ℓ)ψ+δi ±δj are strongly isomorphic for all i, j = 1, . . . , p such that i 6= j.
Moreover, if

               fi (ψ1 , . . . , ψp ) M (ℓ)ψ = 0          or       ei (ψ1 , . . . , ψp ) M (ℓ)ψ = 0

then
                         fi (ψ1 , . . . , ψj ± 1, . . . , ψp ) M (ℓ)ψ±δj = 0            or
                          ei (ψ1 , . . . , ψj + 1, . . . , ψp ) M (ℓ)ψ±δj = 0,
respectively, for all j 6= i.

     Let ai , a′i ∈ Z ∪ {±∞}, ai ≤ a′i , i ∈ {1, . . . , p}. Denote

      P (a1 , . . . , ap , a′1 , . . . , a′p ) = {(x1 , . . . , xp ) ∈ Z p | ai ≤ xi ≤ a′i , i = 1, . . . , p},

a parallelepiped in Z p . Note that some faces of the parallelepiped can be infinite
in some directions. In particular, in the case ai = −∞, a′i = ∞ for all i, the
parallelepiped coincides with Z p .

Theorem 8.5. For any irreducible weight module L(ℓ) over Yp (gl2 ) there exist
elements ai , a′i ∈ Z ∪ {±∞}, ai ≤ a′i , i ∈ {1, . . . , p} such that

                                Supp L(ℓ) = P (a1 , . . . , ap , a′1 , . . . , a′p ).

Proof. Let ℓ = (β, γ) ∈ P1 . Fix i ∈ {1, . . . , p}. If γ(−βi + k) 6= 0 for all k ∈ Z then

                                 (k1 , . . . , ki + m, . . . , kp ) ∈ Supp L(ℓ)

as soon as (k1 , . . . , kp ) ∈ Supp L(ℓ). This follows immediately from Lemma 8.4. In
this case we set ai = −∞ and a′i = ∞. Now let γ(−βi + k) = 0 for some k ∈ Z.
Let m ≥ 0 be the smallest integer (if it exists) such that γ(−βi − m) = 0 and let
n ≤ 0 be the largest integer (if it exists) such that γ(−βi − n + 1) = 0. It follows
from Lemma 8.4 that

              Supp L(ℓ) ∩ {β + kδi | k ∈ Z} = {β + nδi , . . . , β, . . . , β + mδi }.

If β + sδj ∈ Supp L(ℓ), j 6= i then

Supp L(ℓ) ∩ {β + sδj + kδi | k ∈ Z} = {β + sδj + nδi , . . . , β + sδj , . . . , β + sδj + mδi }.

In this case we set ai = βi + n and a′i = βi + m. The statement of the theorem now
follows.                                                                         

8.3. Indecomposable generic weight modules. Fix ℓ = (β, γ) ∈ P1 . A full
subcategory S ⊆ Kℓ is called a skeleton of Kℓ provided the objects of S are pairwise
non-isomorphic and any object of Kℓ is isomorphic to some object of S. In this
case the categories of Kℓ -mod and S-mod are equivalent.
   For each i ∈ {1, . . . , p} consider a set Ii = {k ∈ Z | γ(−βi − k) = 0}. Define a
category Sℓ as a k-category with the set of objects
                            S0 = {0, . . . , |I1 |} × · · · × {0, . . . , |Ip |}

                                                               1 ,...,cp ) (e1 ,...,ep )

for all k 6= r and all possible x, y ∈ {r, s} and all ai , ei , ci , with 1 ≤ i ≤ p for which
this equality makes sense.
   It follows from the construction that Sℓ is the skeleton of the category Kℓ . Note
that the corresponding algebra is finite-dimensional. In particular, Sℓ is semisimple
when Ik = ∅ for all 1 ≤ k ≤ p, i.e. when γ(−βk + r) 6= 0 for all k ∈ Z and all
i = 1, . . . , p. Hence it is sufficient to describe all indecomposable modules over Sℓ .
   Fix a ∈ S0 and define a simple Sℓ -module Sa such that Sa (b) = δa,b k for all
b ∈ S0 and all morphisms are trivial. Since Sℓ defines a finite-dimensional algebra
we have the following
Proposition 8.6. Any simple module over Sℓ is isomorphic to Sa for some a ∈ S0 .
   This is another confirmation of the fact that all weight spaces in any irreducible
generic weight Yp (gl2 )-module are 1-dimensional. But this need not be the case
for indecomposable modules. We restrict ourselves to a full subcategory Rℓf ⊆ Rℓ
which consists of weight modules V with dim Vψ < ∞ for all ψ ∈ Supp V . We will
establish the representation type of the category Rℓf (finite, tame or wild). For the
necessary definitions we refer the reader to [Dr].
   To establish the representation type of the category Rℓf it is sufficient to con-
sider the category Sℓ -modf of modules over the category Sℓ with finite-dimensional
weight spaces. Denote Xℓ = {k ∈ {1, . . . , p} | Ik 6= ∅}.
8.3.1. Indecomposable modules in the case |Xℓ | = 1. In this section we describe
all indecomposable modules over Sℓ in the case |Xℓ | = 1. Let Xℓ = {i} and let
|Ii | = r > 0. In this case the category Sℓ has the following quiver A with the
relations:
                  1 a1 2       r ar r + 1
                  ◦ -◦ . . . ◦  - ◦                    ai b i = b i ai = 0
                       b1         br
   We denote by Si , i ∈ {1, . . . , r+1}, the simple module corresponding to the point
i. These modules correspond to all irreducible modules in Rℓf by Proposition 8.6.
26         VYACHESLAV FUTORNY, ALEXANDER MOLEV, AND SERGE OVSIENKO


Now describe the remaining indecomposable modules for the quiver above. Fix
integers 1 ≤ k1 < k2 ≤ r + 1 and a function
                              ξk1 ,k2 : {k1 , k1 + 1, . . . , k2 } → {0, 1}.
Define the module M = M (k1 , k2 , ξk1 ,k2 ) as follows: M (i) = kei , k1 ≤ i ≤ k2 and
M (i) = 0 otherwise. Furthermore,
                       ai ei = ei+1 ,      bi ei+1 = 0         if     ξk1 ,k2 (i) = 1

and

                       ai ei = 0,       bi ei+1 = ei      if        ξk1 ,k2 (i) = 0,
for all 1 ≤ i < k2 . The proof of the following proposition is standard; see e.g. [GR].
Proposition 8.7. The modules Si for 1 ≤ i ≤ r + 1 and M (k1 , k2 , ξk1 ,k2 ) with
1 ≤ k1 < k2 ≤ r + 1 and
                              ξk1 ,k2 : {k1 , k1 + 1, . . . , k2 } → {0, 1},
exhaust all non-isomorphic indecomposable modules for A.
8.3.2. Indecomposable modules in the case |X|ℓ = 2. In this section we describe the
indecomposable modules for Sℓ when |X|ℓ = 2 and |Ik | = 1 for each k ∈ Xℓ . Then
Sℓ is isomorphic to the following category B considered in [BB].

By Proposition 8.6, this category has four non-isomorphic simple modules Si where
i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, with the support in the given point i. The indecomposable modules
were described in [BB]. For the sake of completeness we repeat here this classifica-
tion.
   We will treat the objects of B as elements of Z/4Z. Consider the following three
families of non-simple indecomposable modules.
Finite family. Fix i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3} and define the B-module Mi such that Mi (j) = kej
for each j = 0, 1, 2, 3 and
       ai ei = ei+1 ,        ai+1 ei+1 = ei+2 ,        bi−1 ei = ei−2 ,          bi−2 ei−1 = ei−2
while uj ek = 0 for all other cases of u ∈ {a, b} and j, k = 0, . . . , 3. Obviously, Mi is
indecomposable module for any i.
Infinite discrete families. Let n ∈ N, n > 1, and j ∈ Z 4 . Define a B-module
Mn,j,1 (respectively, Mn,j,2 ) as follows. Consider n elements e1 , . . . , en . A k-basis
of the vector space Mn,j,1 (l) (respectively, Mn,j,2 (l)) is the set of ek such that
j + k − 1 ≡ l(mod 4). The elements al and bl−1 act as follows:
                
                    ek+1 ,   if l is even (resp., odd), k < n and j + k − 1 ≡ l(mod 4);
     al e k =
                    0,       otherwise.

              

  bl−1 ek =
                  0,         otherwise.
All modules Mn,j,1 and Mn,j,2 , n > 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ 3 are non-isomorphic indecomposable
B-modules.
Infinite continuous families. For each λ ∈ k, λ 6= 0, and d ∈ Z, d > 0 define the
B-modules Md,λ,1 and Md,λ,2 as follows. Set
                   Md,λ,1 (i) = kd ,
                  Md,λ,1 (a0 ) = Md,λ,1 (a2 ) = Md,λ,1 (b1 ) = Id ,
                  Md,λ,1 (b0 ) = Md,λ,1 (b2 ) = Md,λ,1 (a1 ) = Md,λ,1 (a3 ) = 0,
                  Md,λ,1 (b3 ) = Jd,λ
and
                   Md,λ,2 (i) = kd ,
                  Md,λ,2 (b0 ) = Md,λ,2 (b2 ) = Md,λ,2 (a1 ) = Id ,
                  Md,λ,2 (a0 ) = Md,λ,2 (a2 ) = Md,λ,2 (b1 ) = Md,λ,2 (b3 ) = 0,
              Md,λ,2 (a3 ) = Jd,λ ,
where Jd,λ is the Jordan cell of dimension d with the eigenvalue λ.
  All modules Md,λ,k , k = 1, 2 are indecomposable and corresponding indecom-
posable modules in Rℓf have all weight spaces of dimension d.
Proposition 8.8. ( [BB], Proposition 3.3.1.) The modules Si , Mi , Mn,i,1 , Mn,i,2 ,
Md,λ,1 , Md,λ,2 where 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, d is a positive integer, λ ∈ k, λ 6= 0, and n ≥ 2 is
an integer, constitute an exhaustive list of pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable
B-modules.
  The following theorem describes the representation type of Rℓf .
Theorem 8.9.         (1) If |Xℓ | = 0 then Rℓf is a semisimple category with a unique
       indecomposable (=irreducible) module;
  (2) If |Xℓ | = 1 then Rℓf has finite representation type;
  (3) If |Xℓ | = 2 then Rℓf has tame representation type if and only if |Ik | = 1 for
       all k ∈ X. Otherwise, Rℓf has wild representation type;
   (4) If |Xℓ | > 2 then Rℓf has wild representation type.
Proof. In the case when |Xℓ | = 1 all indecomposable modules for Sℓ are described
in Proposition 8.7. Hence Rℓf has the finite representation type. If |Xℓ | = 2 and
|Ik | = 1 for each k ∈ X then all indecomposable modules for Sℓ are described in
Proposition 8.8. It follows from the definition that Rℓf has the tame representation
type in this case. If |Ik | > 1 for at least one k then it is easy to construct a family
of indecomposable modules that depends on two continuous parameters. Hence,
in this case Rℓf has the wild representation type. Suppose now that |Xℓ | > 2.
Then Sℓ contains a full subcategory of wild representation type considered in [BB,
Theorem 1]. We immediately conclude that Rℓf has the wild representation type.
This completes the proof.                                                             
Corollary 8.10.      (1) If |Xℓ | = 0 then the category Rℓ is a semisimple category
       with a unique indecomposable module.

     (2) If |Xℓ | = 1 then Rℓ has finite representation type with indecomposable mod-
         ules as in Proposition 8.7.
Proof. Since cases |Xℓ | ≤ 1 correspond to the finite representation type then the
corresponding categories do not admit infinite-dimensional indecomposable mod-
ules by [A] and hence every indecomposable module belongs to Rℓf .              
