                                             1    Introduction
                                             The Paley–Wiener theorem for K-finite compactly supported smooth functions
                                             on a real reductive group Lie group G of the Harish-Chandra class is due to J.
                                             Arthur [1] in general, and to O.A. Campoli [9] for G of split rank one.
                                                 In our paper [7] we established a similar Paley–Wiener theorem for smooth
                                             functions on a reductive symmetric space. In this paper we will show that
                                             Arthur’s theorem is a consequence of our result if one considers the group G as
                                             a symmetric space for G × G with respect to the left times right action. At the
                                             same time we will formulate a Paley–Wiener theorem for K-finite generalized
                                             functions (in the sense of distribution theory) on G, and prove that it is a
                                             special case of the Paley–Wiener theorem for symmetric spaces established in
                                             our paper [8].
                                                 All mentioned Paley–Wiener theorems are formulated in the following spirit.
                                             A Fourier transform is defined by means of Eisenstein integrals for the mini-
                                             mal principal series for the group or space under consideration. The Eisen-
                                             stein integrals depend on a certain spectral parameter and satisfy the so called
                                             Arthur–Campoli relations. A Paley–Wiener space is defined as a certain space of



                                                                                    1
meromorphic functions in the spectral parameter, characterized by the Arthur–
Campoli relations and by growth estimates. The Paley–Wiener theorem asserts
that the Fourier transform is a topological linear isomorphism from a space of
K-finite compactly supported smooth or generalized functions onto a particular
Paley–Wiener space.
    The Paley–Wiener space of Arthur’s paper is defined in terms of Eisenstein
integrals as introduced by Harish-Chandra [13]; we shall refer to these integrals
as being unnormalized. Our Paley–Wiener theorems in [7] and [8] are defined
in terms of the so-called normalized Eisenstein integrals defined in [3]. For
G considered as a symmetric space the normalized Eisenstein integral differs
from the unnormalized one. Consequently, the associated Fourier transforms
and Paley–Wiener spaces are different. The final objective of this paper is to
clarify the relationships between the various Paley–Wiener spaces.
    Recently, P. Delorme, [12], has proved a different Paley–Wiener theorem,
involving the operator-valued Fourier transforms associated with all generalized
principal series representations. In his result the Arthur–Campoli relations are
replaced by intertwining relations. Moreover, the result is valid without the
restriction of K-finiteness.
    We shall now give a brief outline of the present paper. In Section 2 we
introduce the basic concepts, in particular the space Cc∞ (G : τ ) of τ -spherical
compactly supported smooth functions, for which Arthur’s theorem is most
conveniently formulated. We review the definition of Harish-Chandra’s (unnor-
malized) Eisenstein integral E(P : λ) for P a minimal parabolic subgroup of
G and with spectral parameter λ ∈ a∗0C ; here a0 is the Lie algebra of the split
component A0 of P. Finally, we give the definition of the associated Fourier
transform u FP .
    In Section 3 we recall, in Theorem 3.3, the formulation of Arthur’s Paley–
Wiener theorem, [1]. This theorem deals with the family of Fourier transforms
(u FQ )Q∈P0 with Q ranging over the finite set P0 of parabolic subgroups with
the same split component A0 . The theorem asserts that this family of trans-
forms establishes an isomorphism from Cc∞ (G : τ ) onto a Paley–Wiener space
u PW(G, τ, P ). The Fourier transforms in the family are completely determined
              0
by any single one among them. Accordingly, in Theorem 3.6, Arthur’s Paley–
Wiener theorem is reformulated by asserting that a single Fourier transform
u F defines a topological linear isomorphism from C ∞ (G : τ ) onto a Paley–
   P                                                     c
Wiener space u PW(G, τ, P ).
    In Section 4 we formulate, in Theorem 4.2, a distributional Paley–Wiener
theorem, which asserts that u FP defines a topological linear isomorphism from
the space Cc−∞ (G : τ ) of τ -spherical compactly supported generalized functions
on G onto a Paley–Wiener space u PW∗ (G, τ, P ).
    At this point of the paper, the main results have been stated. The rest of
the paper is devoted to proofs. In Section 5 we prepare for this by introducing
the C-functions and listing those of their properties that are needed.
    In Section 6 we give the proof that Theorem 3.6 is indeed a reformulation
of Arthur’s theorem. We describe the relations between the different Fourier
transforms in terms of C-functions. The equivalence of Theorems 3.3 and 3.6
is then captured by the assertion, in Proposition 6.4, that the natural map

                                        2
between the Paley–Wiener spaces u PW(G, τ, P0 ) and u PW(G, τ, P ) is a topo-
logical isomorphism.
    In the next Section, 7, a normalized Fourier transform FP is defined in terms
of the normalized Eisenstein integral
                  E ◦ (P : λ : · ): = E(P : λ : · ) ◦ CP |P (1 : λ)−1 ;
This normalization is natural from the point of view of asymptotic expansions;
it has the effect that the new, normalized C-functions become unitary for imagi-
nary λ. It follows from the relation between the Eisenstein integrals that the nor-
malized Fourier transform is related to the above Fourier transform by a relation
of the form u FP = UP ◦ FP , where UP denotes multiplication by a C-function
λ 7→ CP |P (1 : −λ̄)∗ . An associated Paley–Wiener space PW(G, τ, P ) is defined,
as well as a distributional Paley–Wiener space, indicated by superscript ∗. The
main result of the section, Theorem 7.8, asserts that the map UP induces iso-
morphisms PW(G, τ, P ) → u PW(G, τ, P ) and PW∗ (G, τ, P ) → u PW∗ (G, τ, P ).
As a result, the associated Paley–Wiener theorems for the normalized Fourier
transform are equivalent to those for the unnormalized transform.
    Let ∗ X denote G viewed as a symmetric space for ∗G: = G × G. In the final
section the unnormalized Eisenstein integral E(P : λ) for G is related to the
unnormalized Eisenstein integral for ∗ X as defined in [3]. It follows from this
relation that the normalized Eisenstein integrals, for G and ∗ X, coincide; there-
fore, so do the normalized Fourier transforms. Likewise, it is shown that the
Paley–Wiener spaces for G coincide with the similar spaces for ∗ X. This finally
establishes the validity of all mentioned Paley–Wiener theorems as special cases
of the theorems in [7] and [8].


2    Basic concepts
Let G be a real reductive Lie group of the Harish-Chandra class and let K be
a maximal compact subgroup. Let Vτ be a finite dimensional Hilbert space,
and let τ be a unitary double representation of K in Vτ . By this we mean
that τ = (τ1 , τ2 ) with τ1 a left and τ2 a right unitary representation of K in
Vτ ; moreover, the representations τ1 and τ2 commute. We will often drop the
subscripts on τ1 and τ2 , writing
                           τ (k1 )vτ (k2 ) = τ1 (k1 )vτ2 (k2 )
for all v ∈ Vτ and k1 , k2 ∈ K. A function f : G → Vτ is called τ -spherical if it
satisfies the rule
                           f (k1 gk2 ) = τ (k1 )f (g)τ (k2 )                (2.1)
for all g ∈ G and k1 , k2 ∈ K. The space of smooth τ -spherical functions is
denoted by C ∞ (G : τ ) and equipped with the usual Fréchet topology. The
subspace Cc∞ (G : τ ) of compactly supported smooth τ -spherical functions is
equipped with the usual complete locally convex (Hausdorff) topology.
    We shall first briefly establish some notation for the group. As usual, we
denote Lie groups by Roman capitals, and their Lie algebras by the Gothic
lower case equivalents.

                                           3
    Let θ ∈ Aut(G) be the Cartan involution associated with K. The associated
infinitesimal involution of g is denoted by the same symbol and the associated
eigenspaces with eigenvalues +1 and −1 by k and p, respectively. Accordingly,
we have the Cartan decomposition g = k ⊕ p.
    Let a0 be a maximal abelian subspace of p and let Σ be the restricted
root system of a0 in g. Let A0 : = exp a0 be the associated vectorial subgroup
of G and let P0 = P(A0 ) be the collection of parabolic subgroups of G with
split component A0 . Each element P ∈ P0 is minimal and has a Langlands
decomposition of the form P = M0 A0 NP , with M0 equal to the centralizer of
A0 in K. Let Σ(P ) be the collection of a0 -roots in nP = Lie(NP ). Then P 7→
Σ(P ) defines a one-to-one correspondence between P(A0 ) and the collection of
positive systems for Σ.
    We equip a0 with a W -invariant positive definite inner product h · , · i; the
dual space a∗0 is equipped with the dual inner product. The latter inner product
is extended to a complex bilinear form on a∗0C . The norm associated with the
inner product on a∗0 is extended to a Hermitian norm on a∗0C , denoted by | · |.
    We shall now review the definition of the τ -spherical Eisenstein integral re-
lated to a given parabolic subgroup P ∈ P(A0 ). Let τM0 denote the restriction
of τ to M0 . As M0 is a subgroup of K, the space L2 (M0 : τM0 ) of square in-
tegrable τM0 -spherical functions M0 → Vτ is finite dimensional and equals the
space of smooth τM0 -spherical functions. We equip M0 with normalized Haar
measure, and define the finite dimensional Hilbert space A2 = A2 (τ ) by

                     A2 : = L2 (M0 : τM0 ) = C ∞ (M0 : τM0 ).                (2.2)

Let ψ ∈ A2 . For λ ∈ a∗0C we define the function ψλ = ψP,λ : G → Vτ by

                         ψλ (namk) = aλ+ρP ψ(m)τ2 (k),

for k ∈ K, m ∈ M0 , a ∈ A0 and n ∈ NP . Here ρP ∈ a∗0 is defined by

                                   1
                           ρP (H) = tr (ad(H)|nP ).
                                   2
By the analytic nature of the Iwasawa decomposition G = NP A0 K, the function
ψλ is analytic. We define the Eisenstein integral E(P : ψ : λ): G → Vτ by
                                       Z
                   E(P : ψ : λ : x): =   τ1 (k)ψλ (k−1 x) dk,             (2.3)
                                        K

for x ∈ G. Then, clearly, E(P : ψ : λ) is a function in C ∞ (G : τ ), depending
linearly on ψ and holomorphically on λ.

Remark 2.1 Here we have adopted the same convention as J. Arthur [1], §2,
which differs from Harish-Chandra’s. Let E HC denote the Eisenstein integral as
defined by Harish-Chandra [13], §9. Then E HC (P : ψ : λ) = E(P : ψ : iλ).
    For the reader’s convenience, we note that Arthur [1] uses the notation
Acusp (M0 , τ ) or A0 for the space (2.2).



                                        4
    In terms of the Eisenstein integral we define a Fourier transform u FP from
Cc∞ (G : τ ) to the space O(a∗0C )⊗ A2 of holomorphic A2 -valued functions on
a∗0C . The superscript u indicatesthat this Fourier transform is defined in terms
of the above unnormalized Eisenstein integral, in contrast with a normalized
Fourier transform FP to be defined later.
    Let dx be a choice of Haar measure on G. We define the Fourier transform
u F f of f ∈ C ∞ (G : τ ) by the formula
   P            c
                                  Z
              u
             h FP f (λ) , ψiA2 = hf (x) , E(P : ψ : −λ̄ : x)iVτ dx,          (2.4)
                                        G

for ψ ∈ A2 and λ ∈ a∗0C . It follows from the Paley–Wiener theorem in              [1]
that u FP is injective on Cc∞ (G : τ ). This injectivity can also be established   by
application of the subrepresentation theorem, [11], Thm. 8.21.


3    Arthur’s Paley–Wiener theorem
The image of Cc∞ (G : τ ) under Fourier transform is described by the Paley–
Wiener theorem due to J. Arthur [1], which we shall now formulate.
   It is convenient to rewrite the definition of the Fourier transform u FP in
terms of a (unnormalized) dual Eisenstein integral. Given x ∈ G and λ ∈ a∗0C ,
we agree to define E(P : λ : x) ∈ Hom(A2 , Vτ ) by the formula

                          E(P : λ : x)ψ: = E(P : ψ : λ : x)

for ψ ∈ A2 . Moreover, we define a dual Eisenstein integral by
                u ∗
                   E (P : λ : x): = E(P : −λ̄ : x)∗ ∈ Hom(Vτ , A2 ),          (3.1)

where the superscript ∗ indicates that the Hilbert adjoint has been taken. The
superscript u serves to distinguish the present dual Eisenstein integral from a
normalized version that will be introduced at a later stage.
    The dual Eisenstein integral uE ∗ may be viewed as a smooth Hom(Vτ , A2 )-
valued function on a∗0C × G which is holomorphic in the first variable. In terms
of this Eisenstein integral, the Fourier transform (2.4) may be expressed as an
integral transform. Indeed, it readily follows from the given definitions that
                                   Z
                      u              u ∗
                        FP f (λ) =    E (P : λ : x)f (x) dx,                (3.2)
                                        G

for f ∈ Cc∞ (G : τ ) and λ ∈   a∗0C .
                                  We now proceed to giving the definition of a
suitable Paley–Wiener space.
    Let V be a finite dimensional real linear space. We denote by S(V ) the
symmetric algebra of VC . This algebra is identified with the algebra of constant
coefficient holomorphic differential operators on VC in the usual way.
    We denote by O(VC ) the space of holomorphic functions on VC and, for
a ∈ VC , by Oa = Oa (VC ) the space of germs of holomorphic functions at a.
Moreover, we denote by Oa (VC )∗tayl the space of linear functionals Oa → C of
the form
                             f 7→ eva (uf ) = uf (a),

                                            5
with u ∈ S(V ). The elements of Oa (VC )∗tayl will be called Taylor functionals at
a, as they give linear combinations of coefficients of a Taylor series at a. Clearly,
the map u 7→ eva ◦ u is a linear isomorphism from S(V ) onto Oa (VC )∗tayl .
    We define the space of Taylor functionals on VC as the algebraic direct sum

                          O(VC )∗tayl : = ⊕a∈VC Oa (VC )∗tayl .

Given U ∈ O(VC )∗tayl , the finite set of a ∈ VC with Ua 6= 0 is called the support
of U, notation supp U. Given f ∈ O(VC ), we put
                                          X
                                Uf: =           Ua fa .
                                             a∈supp U

The map U ⊗ f 7→ U f defines an embedding of O(VC )∗tayl into the linear dual
O(VC )∗ ; this justifies the notation. Note that in fact the elements of O(VC )∗tayl
are continuous with respect to the usual Fréchet topology on O(VC ).
                                                      P U : VC → S(V ) may be
    Finally, we note that a finitely supported function
viewed as a Taylor functional by the formula U f : = a eva [U (a)f ]. Accordingly,
the space of Taylor functionals may be identified with the space of finitely
supported functions VC → S(V ).

Definition 3.1 An (unnormalized, holomorphic) Arthur–Campoli functional
for (G, τ, P0 ) is a family (LP )P ∈P0 ⊂ O(a∗0C )∗tayl ⊗ A∗2 such that
                            X
                                   LP [uE ∗ (P : · : x)vP ] = 0
                           P ∈P0

for all x ∈ G and all (vP )P ∈P0 ⊂ Vτ . The linear space of such families is denoted
by u AChol (G, τ, P0 ).

    For R > 0 we define HR (a∗0C ) to be the space of holomorphic functions
ϕ: a∗0C → C such that for every n ∈ N,

                 νR,n (ϕ): = sup (1 + |λ|)n e−R|Re λ| |ϕ(λ)| < ∞.
                              λ∈a∗0C

Equipped with the seminorms νR,n , for n ∈ N, this space is a Fréchet space.

Definition 3.2 Let R > 0. The Paley–Wiener space u PWR (G, τ, P0 ) is defined
to be the space of families (ϕP )P ∈P0 ⊂ HR (a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 such that
                                 X
                                       LP ϕP = 0
                                     P ∈P0

for all (LP )P ∈P0 ∈ u AChol (G, τ, P0 ).

   By continuity of the Taylor functionals, the Paley–Wiener space is a closed
subspace of the direct sum of a finite number of copies of HR (a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 , one for
each P ∈ P0 ; it is therefore a Fréchet space of its own right.


                                                6
    For R > 0 we put GR : = K exp B̄R K, where B̄R denotes the closed ball of
center 0 and radius R in a0 . Moreover, we define the following closed subspace
of Cc∞ (G : τ ), and equip it with the relative topology:
                   ∞
                  CR (G : τ ) = {f ∈ C ∞ (G : τ ) | supp f ⊂ GR }.

We have now gathered the concepts and notation needed to formulate the Paley–
Wiener theorem due to J. Arthur, [1], p. 83, Thm. 3.3.l.

Theorem 3.3 (Arthur [1]) The map f 7→ (u FP f )P ∈P0 is a topological linear

    Each of the individual Fourier transforms u FP , for P ∈ P0 , is already in-
jective on Cc∞ (G : τ ). It is therefore natural to reformulate Arthur’s theorem in
terms of a single Fourier transform.

Definition 3.4 Let P ∈ P0 . An (unnormalized, holomorphic) Arthur–Campoli
functional for the triple (G, τ, P ) is a functional L ∈ O(a∗0C )∗tayl ⊗ A∗2 such that

                              L[uE ∗ (P : · : x)v] = 0,                         (3.3)

for all x ∈ G and all v ∈ Vτ . The space of such functionals is denoted by
u AC (G, τ, P ).
     hol

Definition 3.5 Let P ∈ P0 and R > 0. We define the Paley–Wiener space
u PW (G, τ, P ) to be the space of functions ϕ ∈ H (a∗ ) ⊗ A such that Lϕ = 0
      R                                           R 0C      2
for all L ∈ u AChol (G, τ, P ).

    Arthur’s Paley–Wiener theorem may now be reformulated as follows.

Theorem 3.6 Let P ∈ P0 and R > 0. The map u FP is a topological linear
                  ∞ (G : τ ) onto u PW (G, τ, P ).
isomorphism from CR                   R

The equivalence of Theorems 3.3 and 3.6 will be established in Section 6.


4    A distributional Paley–Wiener space
In this section we will formulate a Paley–Wiener theorem characterizing the
image under Fourier transform of the space Cc−∞ (G : τ ) of compactly supported
τ -spherical generalized functions.
    We shall first define the mentioned space. The space Cc−∞ (G) of compactly
supported generalized functions on G is defined as the topological linear dual
of the Fréchet space of smooth densities on G. It is equipped with the strong
dual topology.
    Via the map f 7→ f dx, the space Cc−∞ (G) is isomorphic with the space
of compactly supported generalized densities on G. Via integration the latter
space may in turn be identified with the continuous linear dual of C ∞ (G), i.e.,
with the space of compactly supported distributions on G.


                                          7
    The pairing with smooth densities induces a natural embedding Cc∞ (G) ֒→
Cc−∞ (G);  accordingly, the left and right regular representations of G in Cc∞ (G)
extend to continuous representations of G in Cc−∞ (G). We now define Cc−∞ (G : Vτ )
as the space of K × K-invariants in Cc−∞ (G) ⊗ Vτ . Again, there is a natural
embedding Cc∞ (G : τ ) ֒→ Cc−∞ (G : τ ).
    The definition of u FP by (3.2), for a given P ∈ P0 , has a natural interpre-
tation for compactly supported τ -spherical generalized functions. Accordingly,
u F extends to a continuous linear map C −∞ (G : τ ) → O(a∗ ) ⊗ A .
   P                                         c                 0C      2
    Let R > 0 and n ∈ N. We define H∗R,n (a∗0C ) to be the space of entire holo-
morphic functions ϕ: a∗0C → C with

               νR,−n (ϕ) = sup (1 + kλk)−n e−R|Re λ| |ϕ(λ)| < ∞.
                           λ∈a∗0C

Equipped with the given norm, this space is a Banach space. If m < n, then

                            H∗R,m (a∗0C ) ⊂ H∗R,n (a∗0C ),

with continuous inclusion map. The union H∗R (a∗0C ) of these spaces, for n ∈ N,
is equipped with the inductive limit locally convex topology.

Definition 4.1 Let P ∈ P0 and R > 0. The distributional Paley–Wiener space
u PW∗ (G, τ, P ) is defined as the space of functions ϕ ∈ H∗ (a∗ ) ⊗ A satisfying
     R                                                     R 0C       2
the Arthur–Campoli relations Lϕ = 0 for all L ∈ u AChol (G, τ, P ).

   By continuity of Taylor functionals, the space u PW∗R (G, τ, P ) is a closed
subspace of H∗R (a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 ; we endow it with the relative topology.
   The following result is the analogue of Arthur’s Paley–Wiener theorem for
K-finite compactly supported generalized functions on G. Given R > 0 we de-
           −∞
note by CR    (G : τ ) the space of τ -spherical generalized functions on G with
support contained in GR = K exp B̄R K. It is equipped with the relative topol-
ogy.

Theorem 4.2 (The Paley–Wiener theorem for generalized functions) Let
P ∈ P0 and R > 0. The Fourier transform u FP extends to a topological linear
                  −∞
isomorphism from CR  (G : τ ) onto u PW∗R (G, τ, P ).

    As mentioned in the introduction, this theorem will follow from the results
of the present paper combined with the distributional Paley–Wiener theorem
for reductive symmetric spaces proved in [8].

Remark 4.3 With the same arguments that will lead to the equivalence of
Theorems 3.6 and 3.3, it can be shown that Theorem 4.2 is equivalent to a
Paley–Wiener theorem for generalized functions involving the family (u FP )P ∈P0
in the same spirit as Theorem 3.3.




                                          8
5    C-functions, singular loci and estimates
To establish the equivalence of Theorems 3.3 and 3.6 we need relations between
the Fourier transforms, which can be given in terms of the so-called C-functions.
The latter arise as coefficients in asymptotic expansions of Eisenstein integrals.
    Let Q ∈ P0 . We denote by a+     Q the positive chamber determined by the
                                  +
positive system Σ(Q) and by AQ the image in A0 under the exponential map.
Then KA+  Q K is an open dense subset of G.
    In view of its τ -spherical behavior, the Eisenstein integral E(P : λ), for
P ∈ P0 , is completely determined by its restriction to A+    Q . It follows from
                                                         +
Harish-Chandra’s result [14], Thm. 18.1, that, on M0 AQ , the given Eisenstein
integral behaves asymptotically as follows:
                      X
  E(P : λ : ma)ψ ∼         asλ−ρQ [CQ|P (s : λ)ψ](m),   (a → ∞ in A+   Q ),  (5.1)
                     s∈W

for every ψ ∈ A2 , every m ∈ M0 , and λ ∈ ia∗reg0   . Here W denotes the Weyl
group of the root system Σ and the coefficients CQ|P (s : · ) are End(A2 )-valued
analytic functions of λ ∈ ia∗reg
                             0   . The functions CQ|P (s : · ), for s ∈ W, are
uniquely determined by these properties. A priori they have a meromorphic
extension to an open neighborhood of ia∗0 in a∗0C .

Remark 5.1 Harish-Chandra denotes the c-functions by lower case letters.
In view of Remark 2.1, the C-functions introduced above are related to Harish-
Chandra’s by the formula CQ|P (s : iλ) = cQ|P (s : λ).

    For P ∈ P0 and R ∈ R we put

              a∗0 (P, R): = {λ ∈ a∗0C | hRe λ , αi < R, ∀α ∈ Σ(P )}.         (5.2)

A Σ-hyperplane in a∗0C is a hyperplane of the form hλ , αi = c, with α ∈ Σ and
c ∈ C. The hyperplane is said to be real if c ∈ R.
    We define ΠΣ (a∗0C ) to be the set of polynomial functions that can be written
as a product of a nonzero complex number and linear factors of the form λ 7→
hλ , αi − c, with α ∈ Σ and c ∈ C. The subset of polynomial functions which
are products as above with c ∈ R is denoted by ΠΣ,R (a∗0C ).

Lemma 5.2 Let P ∈ P0 . The endomorphism C(1: λ) = CP |P (1: λ) ∈ End(A2 )
is invertible for generic λ ∈ ia∗0 . Both maps

                                 λ 7→ C(1: λ)±1                              (5.3)

extend to End(A2 )-valued meromorphic functions on a∗0C that can be expressed
as products of functions of the form λ 7→ cα (hλ , αi), for α ∈ Σ(P ), with cα
a meromorphic function on C with real singular locus. Accordingly, each of
the functions (5.3) has a singular locus equal to a locally finite union of real
Σ-hyperplanes in a∗0C .
    Let R ∈ R. Only a finite number of the mentioned singular hyperplanes
intersect −a∗0 (P, R). There exist polynomial functions q± ∈ ΠΣ,R (a∗0 ) such that

                                        9
λ 7→ q± (λ)C(1 : −λ)±1 are regular on the closure of the set a∗0 (P, R). If q± is
any pair of polynomials with these properties, there exist constants n ∈ N and
C > 0 such that
            kq ± (λ)C(1 : −λ)±1 k ≤ C(1 + |λ|)n ,        (λ ∈ a∗0 (P, R)).
Proof. All assertions readily follow from the arguments in [1], proof of Lemma
5.2, except possibly for the final estimate, which at first follows for a particular
choice of q± . A straightforward application of the Cauchy integral formula then
gives the result for arbitrary q± satisfying the hypotheses.                      
   Following Harish-Chandra [15], §17, we define the following normalized C-
functions, for P, Q ∈ P0 and s ∈ W :
                    ◦
                     CQ|P (s : λ): = CQ|Q (1 : sλ)−1 CQ|P (s : λ).              (5.4)
The following result, due to Harish-Chandra, [15], will be of crucial importance
to us.
Lemma 5.3 (Harish-Chandra [15]) For all P, Q ∈ P0 and s ∈ W, the
End(A2 )-valued function λ 7→ ◦CQ|P (s : λ) has a rational extension to a∗0C .
    The endomorphism ◦CQ|P (s : λ) is invertible for generic λ ∈ a∗0C and λ 7→
◦C            −1 is a rational End(A )-valued function.
   Q|P (s : λ)                      2
    Finally, each of the functions λ 7→ ◦CQ|P (s : λ)±1 is a product of functions
of the form λ 7→ cα (hλ , αi), for α ∈ Σ, with cα a End(A2 )-valued rational
function on C.
Proof. The assertions for ◦CQ|P (s : λ) follow from [15], Lemma 19.2 combined
with the Corollary to Lemma 17.2 and with Lemma 17.4 of the same article.
For imaginary λ, the endomorphism ◦CQ|P (s : λ) is unitary, by [15], Lemma
17.3. The remaining assertions now follow by application of Cramer’s rule. 


6    Relations between the Fourier transforms
According to [15], Lemma 17.2, the Eisenstein integrals are related by the fol-
lowing functional equations:
                    E(P : λ : · ) = E(Q : sλ : · )◦CQ|P (s : λ),                (6.1)
for P, Q ∈ P0 and s ∈ W, as an identity of meromorphic C ∞ (G)⊗ Hom(A2 , Vτ )-
valued functions in the variable λ ∈ a∗0C .
Lemma 6.1 Let P, Q ∈ P0 . Then ◦CQ|P (1 : λ) ◦ ◦CP |Q (1 : λ) = I, as an iden-
tity of End(A2 )-valued functions in the variable λ ∈ a∗0C .
Proof. From the functional equation for the Eisenstein integral it follows that,
for x ∈ G,
               E(P : λ : x) = E(P : λ : x)◦CP |Q (1 : λ)◦CQ|P (1 : λ).
Using (5.1), we infer that this identity is valid with CP |P (1 : λ) in place of
E(P : λ : x) on both sides. As CP |P (1 : λ) is invertible for generic λ, the required
identity follows.                                                                   

                                         10
   In view of (3.1) it follows immediately from (6.1) that the unnormalized dual
Eisenstein integrals satisfy the following functional equations, for P, Q ∈ P0 and
s ∈ W,
                ◦
                 CQ|P (s : −λ̄)∗ uE ∗ (Q : sλ : · ) = uE ∗ (P : λ : · ),      (6.2)
as an identity of meromorphic C ∞ (G) ⊗ Hom(Vτ , A2 )-valued functions of λ ∈
a∗0C . In view of the definition of the Fourier transform in (3.2), this in turn
implies that, for every f ∈ Cc∞ (G, τ ),
                         ◦
                         CQ|P (s : −λ̄)∗ u FQ f (sλ) = u FP f (λ),               (6.3)

as an identity of meromorphic A2 -valued functions of λ ∈ a∗0C .

Lemma 6.2 Let ϕ = (ϕP )P ∈P0 ⊂ O(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 , and assume that Lϕ = 0 for
all L ∈ uAC(G, τ, P0 ). Then for all P, Q ∈ P0 and s ∈ W,
                             ◦
                              CQ|P (s : −λ̄)∗ ϕQ (sλ) = ϕP (λ),                  (6.4)

for generic λ ∈ a∗0C .

Proof. Let P, Q ∈ P0 and s ∈ W be fixed. In view of Lemma 5.3 there
exists a polynomial function q ∈ ΠΣ (a∗0C ) such that λ 7→ q(λ)◦CQ|P (s : −λ̄)∗ is
polynomial. Let ϕ fulfill the hypothesis and let µ ∈ a∗0C \ q −1 (0).
    We define Taylor functionals LR ∈ O(a∗0C )∗tayl ⊗ A∗2 by LP ψ: = −q(µ)ψ(µ)
and LQ ψ = evµ [λ 7→ q(λ)◦CQ|P (s : −λ̄)∗ ψ(sλ)], for ψ ∈ O(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 , and by
LR = 0 for R ∈ P0 \{P, Q}. It follows from (6.2) that L ∈ uAC(G, τ, P0 ). Hence,
Lϕ = 0. We conclude that ϕ satisfies (6.4) for λ ∈ a∗0C \ q −1 (0).             
    If V is a finite dimensional real linear space, we denote by M(VC ) the space
of meromorphic functions on VC . Given P, Q ∈ P0 , we define the endomorphism
γP |Q of M(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 by

                             [γP |Q ψ](λ) = ◦CQ|P (1 : −λ̄)∗ ψ(λ).

In particular, γP |P = I.

Lemma 6.3 Let P, Q ∈ P0 and R > 0. Then γP |Q maps                   u PW
                                                                            R (G, τ, Q)
continuously into HR (a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 .

Proof. It follows from Lemma 5.3 that there exists a polynomial q ∈ ΠΣ (a∗0C )
such that the function λ 7→ q(λ) ◦CQ|P (1 : −λ̄)∗ is polynomial on a∗0C . This
in turn implies that the map q ◦ γP |Q maps u PWR (G, τ, Q) continuously into
HR (a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 .
    Let α ∈ Σ and c ∈ C be such that l: λ 7→ hλ , αi − c is a factor of q. Let
d be the highest integer such that ld is still a factor of q. Let Hα denote the
element of a0 determined by Hα ⊥ ker α and α(Hα ) = 2. Fix 0 ≤ k < d. Then
the element Hαk ∈ S(a0 ), viewed as a constant coefficient differential operator
on a∗0C satisfies Hαk q = 0 on l−1 (0). Fix λ0 ∈ l−1 (0) and consider the functional
L ∈ O(a∗0C )∗tayl ⊗ A∗2 defined by

                                 L(ϕ): = evλ0 ◦ Hαk [qγP |Q ϕ],                  (6.5)

                                              11
for ϕ ∈ O(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 . It follows from (6.2) that, for all x ∈ G and v ∈ Vτ , the
function γP |Q uE ∗ (Q : · : x)v equals uE ∗ (P : · : x)v, hence is holomorphic on
a∗0C . By application of the Leibniz rule we now see that L(uE ∗ (Q : · : x)v) = 0
for all x ∈ G and v ∈ Vτ . Hence, L belongs to u AChol (G, τ, Q). Let now ϕ ∈
u PW (G, τ, Q). Then it follows that (6.5) equals zero. As this is valid for every
       R
λ0 ∈ l−1 (0) and all 0 ≤ k < d, it follows that ld divides q(λ)γP |Q ϕ. Treating
all factors of q in this fashion, we see that γP |Q ϕ is holomorphic on a∗0C outside
a subset of complex codimension 2. It follows that γP |Q maps u PWR (G, τ, Q)
into O(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 . Since qγP |Q maps u PWR (G, τ, Q) continuous linearly into
HR (a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 , it follows by a repeated application of Cauchy’s integral formula,
treating the linear factors of q one at a time, that γP |Q is a continuous linear
map u PWR (G, τ, Q) → HR (a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 .                                           
    If L ∈ uAC(G, τ, P ), then the family of Taylor functionals (L′Q )Q∈P0 de-
fined by L′P = L and by L′Q = 0 for Q 6= P belongs to uAC(G, τ, P0 ). Ac-
cordingly, we may view uAC(G, τ, P ) as a subspace of uAC(G, τ, P0 ). It follows
that u PWR (G, τ, P0 ), for R > 0, is a subspace of the direct sum of the spaces
u PW (G, τ, P ), for P ∈ P . Moreover, by continuity of Taylor functionals, this
      R                     0
subspace is closed.

Proposition 6.4 Let Q ∈ P0 . Then, for each R > 0, the projection onto the
component with index Q induces a topological linear isomorphism
                     u                             u
                         PWR (G, τ, P0 ) −→            PWR (G, τ, Q).             (6.6)

Proof. Let E denote the direct sum of a finite number of copies of HR (a∗0C )⊗A2 ,
labeled by the elements of P0 . For each such element P let prP : E → HR (a∗0C ) ⊗
A2 denote the projection onto the component of label P. We define the map
γQ : u PWR (G, τ, Q) → E by

                          prP ◦ γQ = γP |Q ,           (∀ P ∈ P0 ).

Then γQ is continuous linear; we will show that it maps into the subspace
u PW (G, τ, P ) of E. Let (L )                        u
     R         0                   P P ∈P0 belong to AChol (G, τ, P0 ). For each P ∈
P0 we select qP ∈ ΠΣ (a0C ) such that λ 7→ qP (λ)◦CQ|P (1 : −λ̄)∗ is a polynomial
                            ∗

function. By Lemma 6.5 below, there exists a L′P ∈ O(a∗0C )∗tayl ⊗ A∗2 such that
LP = PL′P ◦ qP on O(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 . By application of the Leibniz rule, we see that
L′′ = P L′P ◦ qP ◦ γP |Q defines an element of O(a∗0C )∗tayl ⊗ A∗2 . It follows from
the functional equations for the Eisenstein integral that, for every x ∈ G and
vQ ∈ Vτ ,
                                           X
             L′′ [uE ∗ (Q : · : x)vQ ] =       L′P ◦ qP [uE ∗ (P : · : x)vQ ]
                                              P
                                          X
                                      =           LP [uE ∗ (P : · : x)vQ ] = 0.
                                              P

Hence, L′′ ∈ u AChol (G, τ, Q). It follows that for ϕ ∈ u PWR (G, τ, Q) we have
                                        X
                        0 = L′′ (ϕ) =      L′P [qP γP |Q (ϕ)].
                                          P


                                          12
Moreover, since γP |Q (ϕ) P is holomorphic for each P ∈ P0 , it follows that the
latter expression equals P LP γQ (ϕ)P . Hence, γQ maps u PWR (G, τ, Q) into
u PW (G, τ, P ). Moreover, it does so continuously, as the latter space carries
       R        0
the relative topology from E.
    From the definition of γQ we see that prQ ◦ γQ = γQ|Q = I. Moreover, if
ϕ ∈ u PWR (G, τ, P0 ), then by Lemma 6.2 with s = 1, it follows that ϕP =
γP |Q (ϕQ ), for all P ∈ P0 . Hence, γQ ◦ prQ = I on u PWR (G, τ, P0 ). It follows
that prQ restricts to a topological linear isomorphism (6.6) with inverse γQ . 

Lemma 6.5 Let q ∈ ΠΣ (a∗0C ). Then for every L ∈ O(a∗0C )∗tayl there exists a
L′ ∈ O(a∗0C )∗tayl such that L = L′ ◦ q on O(a∗0C ).

Proof. This may be proved in the same fashion as [7], Lemma 10.5.                
   It is an immediate consequence of Proposition 6.4 that Theorem 3.3 and
Theorem 3.6 are equivalent.


7    The normalized Fourier transform
The purpose of this section is to give equivalent versions of the Paley–Wiener
theorems discussed in the previous sections, Theorem 3.6 and Theorem 4.2. The
new versions are formulated in terms of a suitably normalized Fourier transform,
which in the final section will be shown to coincide with the analogous Fourier
transform for the group viewed as a symmetric space. The normalized Fourier
transform is defined as in Section 2, but with a differently normalized Eisenstein
integral.
    Let P ∈ P0 . We define the normalized Eisenstein integral by

                   E ◦ (P : λ : x) = E(P : λ : x)CP |P (1 : λ)−1 ,           (7.1)

for generic λ ∈ a∗0C and for x ∈ G. Then λ 7→ E ◦ (P : λ) is a meromorphic
C ∞ (G) ⊗ Hom(A2 , Vτ )–valued function on a∗0C . It is not entire holomorphic
anymore, but its singular set is of a simple nature. Indeed, by Lemma 5.2 the
singular set is a locally finite union of hyperplanes of the form hλ , αi = c, with
α ∈ Σ+ , c ∈ R. Moreover, the occurring constants c are bounded from below.
It is known that the singular set is disjoint from the imaginary space ia∗0 , but
we shall not need this here.
    As before we define (normalized) dual Eisenstein integrals by

                E ∗ (P : λ : x) = E ◦ (P : −λ̄ : x)∗ ∈ Hom(Vτ , A2 )         (7.2)

for generic λ ∈ a∗0C and for x ∈ G. In terms of these we define the normalized
Fourier transform FP : Cc−∞ (G : τ ) → M(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 by
                                  Z
                       FP f (λ) =    E ∗ (P : λ : x)f (x) dx.
                                    G

Lemma 7.1 Let f ∈ Cc−∞ (G, τ ). The unnormalized and normalized Fourier
transforms are related by
                       CP |P (1 : −λ̄)∗ FP f (λ) = u FP f (λ),              (7.3)
as an identity of meromorphic functions of the variable λ ∈ a∗0C .
Proof. Replacing λ by −λ̄ in both sides of (7.1), then multiplying with the
C-function and taking conjugates, we obtain, in view of (3.1) and (7.2),
                  CP |P (1 : −λ̄)∗ E ∗ (P : λ : x) = uE ∗ (P : λ : x),
as meromorphic functions of λ ∈ a∗0C with values in C ∞ (G) ⊗ Hom(Vτ , A2 ). The
result follows by testing with f dx.                                          
     The singular nature of the normalized Eisenstein integral does not allow us
to define Arthur–Campoli functionals in terms of Taylor functionals as we did
in Section 3. Instead we need the concept of Laurent functional introduced in
[6], Sect. 12. We briefly recall its definition.
     Let V be a finite-dimensional real linear space and let X ⊂ V ∗ \ {0} be a
finite subset. For a point a ∈ VC , we define the polynomial function πa : VC → C
by                                     Y
                                πa : =    (ξ − ξ(a)).
                                       ξ∈X

The ring of germs of meromorphic functions at a is denoted by M(VC , a). We
define the subring
                      M(VC , a, X): = ∪N ∈N πa−N Oa .
Let eva denote the linear functional on Oa that assigns to a germ f ∈ Oa its
value f (a) at a.
    An X-Laurent functional at a ∈ VC is a linear functional L ∈ M(VC , a, X)∗
such that for every N ∈ N there exists a uN ∈ S(V ) such that
                       L = eva ◦ uN ◦ πaN          on     πa−N Oa .         (7.4)
The space of all Laurent functionals on VC , relative to X, is defined as the
algebraic direct sum of linear spaces
                                        M
                     M(VC , X)∗laur : =   M(VC , X, a)∗laur .            (7.5)
                                         a∈VC

For L in the space (7.5), the finite set of a ∈ VC for which the component La is
nonzero is called the support of L and denoted by supp L.
   According to the above definition, any L ∈ M(VC , X)∗laur may be decom-
posed as                                 X
                                 L=            La .
                                        a∈supp L

Let M(VC , X) denote the space of meromorphic functions ϕ on VC with the
property that the germ ϕa at any point a ∈ VC belongs to M(VC , a, X). Then
the natural bilinear map M(VC , X)∗laur × M(VC , X) → C, given by
                                           X
                        (L, ϕ) 7→ Lϕ: =          La ϕa

induces an embedding of M(VC , X)∗laur onto a linear subspace of the dual space
M(VC , X)∗ . For more details concerning these definitions, we refer the reader
to [6], Sect. 12.

Lemma 7.2 Let L ∈ M(VC , X)∗laur and let ψ ∈ M(Ω, X), for Ω an open
neighborhood of supp L. Then L ◦ ψ belongs to M(VC , X)∗laur .

Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that L is supported by a
single point a ∈ VC . First assume that ψa ∈ Oa . Then the result follows by a
straightforward application of the definition containing (7.4) combined with the
Leibniz rule. It remains to establish the result for ψ = πa−k , with k ∈ N. In this
case the result is an immediate consequence of the mentioned definition.         
    The following result relates the Laurent functionals to the Taylor functionals
defined in Section 3. The inclusion map O(VC ) ⊂ M(VC , X) induces a surjection
M(VC , X)∗ → O(VC )∗ . This property of surjectivity also holds on the level of
Laurent functionals. The space O(VC )∗tayl may naturally be viewed as a subspace
of O(VC )∗ . The natural map M(VC , X)∗laur → O(VC )∗ maps into this subspace.

Lemma 7.3 The natural map M(VC , X)∗laur → O(VC )∗tayl is surjective.

Proof. Let U ∈ O(VC )∗tayl . Without loss of generality we may assume that U is
supported by a single point a ∈ VC . Then U = eva ◦ u for some u ∈ S(V ). By
[4], Lemma 1.7 with d′ = 0, there exists a L ∈ M(VC , a, X)∗laur determined by a
sequence (un )n∈N ⊂ S(V ), such that u0 = u. Thus, L restricts to U on O(VC ).

    Before proceeding, we formulate a result concerning division that will be
frequently used in the sequel.

Lemma 7.4 Let E be a finite dimensional complex linear space. Let S be a
linear subspace of M(VC , X)⊗E, let S ◦ be the annihilator of S in M(VC , X)∗laur ⊗
E ∗ and let S ◦◦ be the space of functions ϕ ∈ M(VC , X) ⊗ E such that Lϕ = 0
for all L ∈ S ◦ .
    Let ψ be a nonzero End(E)-valued meromorphic function on VC such that
both ψ and ψ −1 belong to M(VC , X) ⊗ End(E). Let Ω ⊂ VC be an open subset
such that ψϕ is regular on Ω for all ϕ ∈ S. Then ψϕ is regular on Ω for all
ϕ ∈ S ◦◦ .

Proof. We first assume that ψ = I. Then every ϕ ∈ S is regular on Ω. Let
now ϕ ∈ S ◦◦ and consider a point a ∈ Ω. Then it suffices to show that the
germ ϕa is regular at a. As ϕa ∈ M(VC , a) ⊗ E, there exists a product q of
factors of the form ξ − ξ(a), with ξ ∈ X, such that qϕa is regular at a. We
fix q of minimal degree. Then qϕa has a non-trivial value at a. Hence, there
exists a linear functional η ∈ E ∗ such that eva ◦ qhϕa , ηi = 6 0. There exists a
Laurent functional L ∈ M(VC , a)∗laur such that L = eva on Oa (VC ). Now L ◦ q
is a Laurent functional, and it follows from the above that L1 : = [L ◦ q] ⊗ η is
nonzero on ϕa . Hence L1 ∈  / S ◦ . It follows that there exists a function ϕ1 ∈ S


                                        15
such that q(a)η(ϕ1 (a)) = L1 ϕ1 is nonzero. This implies that q is nonzero at a,
hence constant. We conclude that ϕa is regular at a.
    We now turn to the case with ψ general. Then multiplication by ψ induces
a linear automorphism of M(VC , X) ⊗ E, whose inverse is multiplication by
ψ −1 . In view of Lemma 7.2, the map ψ ∗ : L 7→ L ◦ ψ is a linear automorphism of
M(VC , X)∗laur ⊗ E with inverse (ψ −1 )∗ . Put S1 : = ψS. Then S1◦ = ψ ∗−1 (S ◦ ) and
S1◦◦ = ψS ◦◦ . By the first part of the proof it follows that all elements of S1◦◦ are
regular on Ω. The result follows.                                                   
   We use the non-degenerate bilinear map h · , · i on a∗0 to identify this space
with its real linear dual. Accordingly we view Σ as a finite subset of a∗∗
                                                                         0 \ {0}
and invoke the space of Σ-Laurent functionals on a∗0C in the following definition.

Definition 7.5 A (normalized) Arthur–Campoli functional for (G, τ, P ) is a
Laurent functional L ∈ M(a∗0C , Σ)∗laur ⊗ A∗2 such that

                               L [E ∗ (P : · : x)v] = 0

for all x ∈ G and v ∈ Vτ . The space of such functionals is denoted by AC(G, τ, P ).

     Our next objective is to define suitable spaces of meromorphic functions
with controlled singular behavior.
     A Σ-hyperplane in a∗0C is defined to be a hyperplane of the form l−1 (0),
where l: λ 7→ hλ , αi − c with α ∈ Σ and c ∈ C. The hyperplane is said to be real
if c ∈ R. A Σ-configuration in a∗0C is a locally finite collection of Σ-hyperplanes.
The configuration is said to be real if all its hyperplanes are real. Let now H
be a real Σ-configuration. For each H ∈ H we fix αH ∈ Σ and sH ∈ R such
that H equals the zero locus of lH : λ 7→ hλ , αi − sH .
     Let d: H → N be a map. For ω a subset of a∗0 whose closure intersects only
finitely many hyperplanes from H, we define the polynomial function πω,d on
a∗0C by                                   Y      d(H)
                               πω,d =           lH .                           (7.6)
                                            H∈H
                                           H∩ cl ω6=∅

Moreover, we define M(a∗0C , H, d) to be the space of meromorphic functions
ϕ ∈ M(a∗0C ) such that for every bounded open subset ω of a∗0 , the function
πω,d ϕ is regular on ω + ia∗0 .
    For ω a bounded subset of a∗0 and n ∈ Z we define the [0, ∞]-valued semi-
norm νω,d,n on M(a∗0C , H, d) by

                   νω,d,n (ϕ): =     sup      (1 + |λ|)n |πω,d (λ)ϕ(λ)|.        (7.7)
                                   λ∈ω+ia∗0

We define P(a∗0C , H, d) to be the space of functions ϕ ∈ M(a∗0C , H, d) such that
νω,d,n (ϕ) < ∞ for every compact set ω ⊂ a∗0 and all n ∈ N. This space is a
Fréchet space with topology induced by the collection of seminorms νω,d,n , for
ω compact and n ∈ N.
    We denote by N = N (a∗0 ) the collection of maps n: C → N, with C the
collection of compact subsets of a∗0 . On N we define the partial ordering ≤

                                              16
by n ≤ m if and only if n(ω) ≤ m(ω) for all ω ∈ C. For n ∈ N we define
Pn∗ (a∗0C , H, d) to be the space of functions ϕ ∈ M(a∗0C , H, d) such that

            νω,d,−n(ω) (ϕ) =        sup (1 + |λ|)−n(ω) |πω,d (λ)ϕ(λ)| < ∞
                                  λ∈ω+ia∗0

for every compact subset ω ⊂ a∗0 . Equipped with the seminorms νω,d,−n(ω) the
space Pn∗ (a∗0C , H, d) is a complete locally convex space. If m ≤ n then clearly
Pm∗ ⊂ P ∗ , with continuous linear inclusion map.
        n
    We now define

                      P ∗ (a∗0C , H, d): = ∪n∈N (a∗0 ) Pn∗ (a∗0C , H, d),

and equip this space with the inductive limit locally convex topology.
    In particular, these definitions may be interpreted for H = ∅ and d = ∅. In
this case we have πω,d = 1 for every ω ⊂ a∗0 , so that

                             P(a∗0C , ∅) and P ∗ (a∗0C , ∅)

are just spaces of holomorphic functions ϕ on a∗0C determined in the above
fashion by seminorms of the form

                         νω,n (ϕ): =         sup        (1 + |λ|)n |ϕ(λ)|.
                                       λ∈ω+ia∗0

For the rest of this section, let P ∈ P0 be fixed and let H = HG,τ,P be the
smallest collection of Σ-hyperplanes in a∗0C such that the singular locus of λ 7→
E ∗ (P : λ : · ) is contained in the union ∪H. In view of Lemma 5.2 the collection
H is locally finite and consists of real Σ-hyperplanes. Moreover, by the same
lemma, the set of H ∈ H with H ∩ a∗0 (P, R) 6= ∅ is finite, for every R ∈ R.
     We define the map d = dG,τ,P : H → N as follows. For each H ∈ H we fix
lH : a∗0C → C as in (7.6) and define d(H) as the smallest integer k ≥ 0 such that
the C ∞ (G) ⊗ Hom(Vτ , A2 )-valued meromorphic function lH     k E ∗ (P : · ) extends
                            ′
regularly over H \ ∪{H ∈ H | H 6= H}. ′

     Given a subset ω ⊂ a∗0 whose closure meets only finitely many hyperplanes
from H, we define the polynomial function πω,d as in (7.6). In particular, we
write π = πP for this polynomial with ω = a∗0 ∩ ā∗0 (P, 0), where the second set
in the intersection denotes the closure of the set (5.2) with R = 0. Thus, the
C ∞ (G) ⊗ Hom(Vτ , A2 )-valued function λ 7→ π(λ)E ∗ (P : λ) is holomorphic on a
neighborhood of ā∗0 (P, R) and π ∈ ΠΣ,R (a∗0 ) is minimal with this property.
     We define the following closed subspace of P(a∗0C , H, d) ⊗ A2 :

          PAC (a∗0C , H, d, P )
            : = {ϕ ∈ P(a∗0C , H, d) ⊗ A2 | Lϕ = 0, ∀L ∈ AC(G, τ, P )}          (7.8)
                              ∗ (a∗ , H, d, P ) in a similar fashion, but with P
Finally, we define the space PAC  0C
              ∗
replaced by P .




                                                   17
Definition 7.6
 (a) Let R > 0. We define the Paley–Wiener space PWR (G, τ, P ) to be the
     subspace of PAC (a∗0C , H, d, P ) consisting of functions ϕ such that, for all
     n ∈ N,
                     sup (1 + kλk)n e−R|Re λ| kπ(λ)ϕ(λ)k < ∞.                 (7.9)
                      λ∈ā∗0 (P,0)

      The space is equipped with the relative topology.

 (b) For R > 0 we define the distributional Paley–Wiener space PW∗R (G, τ, P )
                             ∗ (a∗ , H, d, P ) consisting of functions ϕ for which
     to be the subspace of PAC   0C
     there exists a constant n ∈ N such that

                        sup (1 + kλk)−n e−R|Re λ| kπ(λ)ϕ(λ)k < ∞.             (7.10)
                     λ∈ā∗0 (P,0)

      This space is also equipped with the relative topology.

    We will finish this section by discussing the relation of these Paley–Wiener
spaces with the unnormalized Paley–Wiener spaces introduced in Definitions
3.5 and 4.1. As a preparation, we first give another characterization of the
unnormalized Paley–Wiener spaces.
    We define PuAC (a∗0C , ∅, P ) and Pu∗AC (a∗0C , ∅, P ) as the closed subspaces of
the spaces P(a∗0C , ∅) ⊗ A2 and P ∗ (a∗0C , ∅) ⊗ A2 , respectively, consisting of the
functions ϕ satisfying the relations Lϕ = 0 for all L ∈ u AChol (G, τ, P ).

Proposition 7.7 Let R > 0.
 (a) The space u PWR (G, τ, P ) consists of the functions ϕ ∈ PuAC (a∗0C , ∅, P )
     with the property that, for every n ∈ N,

                             sup (1 + |λ|)n e−R|Re λ| kϕ(λ)k < ∞.             (7.11)
                          λ∈ā∗0 (P,0)

      Moreover, the topology of u PWR (G, τ, P ) coincides with the relative topol-
      ogy from PuAC (a∗0C , ∅, P ).

 (b) The space u PW∗R (G, τ, P ) consists of the functions ϕ ∈ Pu∗AC (a∗0C , ∅, P )
     with the property that there exists a number n ∈ N such that

                            sup (1 + |λ|)−n e−R|Re λ| kϕ(λ)k < ∞.             (7.12)
                         λ∈ā∗0 (P,0)

      Moreover, the topology of u PW∗R (G, τ, P ) coincides with the relative topol-
      ogy from Pu∗AC (a∗0C , ∅, P ).

Proof. We start by making some remarks on Euclidean Paley–Wiener spaces.
From the text preceding Definition 3.2 we recall the definition of the space
HR (a∗0C ), equipped with the Fréchet topology T induced by the seminorms νR,n ,
for n ∈ N. Clearly, HR (a∗0C ) ⊂ P(a∗0C , ∅), with continuous inclusion map. We
denote by Tr the associated relative topology on HR (a∗0C ). Then T is finer than
Tr . We will show that both topologies are in fact equal.

                                         18
     By the Euclidean Paley–Wiener theorem, Euclidean Fourier transform Feucl
defines a continuous linear isomorphism from CR              ∞ (a ) onto H (a∗ ). From a
                                                                 0         R 0C
                                                                                      −1
straightforward estimation it follows that the inverse Fourier transform Feucl             is
                           ∗           ∞
continuous from P(a0C , ∅) to C (a0 ). It follows from the above that the identity
                −1
map Feucl ◦ Feucl     is continuous from (HR (a∗0C ), Tr ) to (HR (a∗0C ), T ). Hence T =
Tr .
     From the text preceding Definition 4.1 we recall the definition of H∗R (a∗0C ),
equipped with the inductive limit locally convex topology denoted T ∗ . Clearly,
H∗R (a∗0C ) ⊂ P ∗ (a∗0C , ∅), with continuous inclusion map. Let Tr∗ denote the as-
sociated relative topology on H∗R (a∗0C ). Then T ∗ is finer than Tr∗ . We will show
that both topologies are equal.
                                                                                    −∞
     By the distributional Euclidean Paley-Wiener theorem, Feucl maps CR                (a0 )
                        ∗    ∗          ′
bijectively onto HR (a0C ). Fix R > R and let k be an arbitrary positive inte-
               −∞
ger. Then CR        (a0 )k , the subspace of generalized functions of order at most k,
naturally embeds into the continuous linear dual of the Banach space CR              k (a ),
                                                                                      ′  0
                                                                         −∞
equipped with the C k norm k · kC k . Accordingly, we equip CR              (a0 )k with the
restriction of the dual norm. By a straightforward estimation, there exists a
Ck > 0 such that
                                  νR,k (Feucl (f )) ≤ Ck kf kC k

Feucl   maps Pn∗ (a∗0C , ∅) ∩ H∗R (a∗0C ) into CR   (a0 )k , with k = n({0}) + dim a0 + 1.
Moreover, this map is continuous with respect to the relative topology from
                                                                     −∞
Pn∗ (a∗0C , ∅) on the first of these spaces. Now Feucl maps CR          (a0 )k continuously
                                                                    −1
into H∗R (a∗0C ). It follows that the identity map Feucl ◦ Feucl       is continuous from
Pn∗ (a∗0C , ∅) ∩ H∗R (a∗0C ) to H∗R (a∗0C ). By the universal property of the inductive
limit, it follows that Tr∗ is finer than T ∗ . Hence T ∗ = Tr∗ .
     We proceed with the actual proof. We denote the subspace of PuAC (a∗0C , ∅, P )
defined in (a) by PW and the similar subspace defined in (b) by PW ∗ . These
subspaces are equipped with the relative topologies. Clearly, u PWR (G, τ, P ) is
a subspace of PW, and u PW∗R (G, τ, P ) a subspace of PW ∗ , with continuous in-
clusion maps. To conclude the proof we must establish the converse inclusions,
also with continuous inclusion maps.
     A holomorphic function ϕ ∈ O(a∗0C )⊗A2 that is annihilated by u AChol (G, τ, P ),
satisfies the functional equations
                             ϕ(λ) = ◦CP |P (s : −λ̄)∗ ϕ(sλ),                          (7.13)
for s ∈ W and generic λ ∈ a∗0C ; in view of Proposition 6.4 this follows from
Lemma 6.2 with P = Q.
     In view of Lemma 5.3, there exists a product qs of linear factors of the form
h · , αi − c, with α ∈ Σ and c ∈ C, such that λ 7→ qs (λ)◦CP |P (s : −s−1 λ̄)∗ is
polynomial. We define
                               Y
                       q(λ): =     qs (sλ),    (λ ∈ a∗0C ).
                                   s∈W

Then there exist constants C > 0 and N ∈ N, such that, for all s ∈ W and
λ ∈ a∗0C ,
                 kq(s−1 λ)◦CP |P (s : −s−1 λ̄)k ≤ C(1 + |λ|)N .

                                             19
If we combine this with the functional equation (7.13), we see that, for each
s ∈ W, every n ∈ Z and all λ ∈ ā∗0 (P, 0),
                           −1 λ|
 (1 + |s−1 λ|)n e−R|Re s           kq(s−1 λ)ϕ(s−1 λ)k ≤ C(1 + |λ|)n+N e−R|Re λ| kϕ(λ)k.

Combining these estimates for s ∈ W, we obtain

               νR,n (qϕ) ≤ C            sup (1 + |λ|)n+N e−R|Re λ| kϕ(λ)k,
                                     λ∈ā∗0 (P,0)

where νR,n is defined as in the first part of the proof. On the other hand, by
an easy application of Cauchy’s integral formula it follows that for every n ∈ Z
there exists a constant Cn > 0 such that

                                     νR,n (ϕ) ≤ Cn νR,n (qϕ),

for all ϕ ∈ O(a∗0C )⊗A2 . It follows from these estimates that PW equals the inter-
section of PuAC (a∗0C , ∅, P ) with the Euclidean Paley–Wiener space HR (a∗0C )⊗A2 .
By definition, the topology of PW equals the relative topology from the first
of these spaces. By the first part of the proof, the topology also coincides
with the relative topology from the second of these spaces. It follows that
PW ⊂ u PWR (G, τ, P ) with continuous inclusion map. This establishes (a).
Assertion (b) follows by a similar argument.                                     
   We define the map UP ∈ Aut(M(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 ) by

                              UP ϕ(λ) = CP |P (1 : −λ̄)∗ ϕ(λ).

Then (7.3) may be rephrased as
                                          u
                                              FP = UP ◦ FP .



Theorem 7.8 Let R > 0. The map UP ∈ Aut(M(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 ) restricts to a
topological linear isomorphism
                                                    ≃
                       PW∗R (G, τ, P ) −→                u
                                                             PW∗R (G, τ, P ),

and similarly to a topological linear isomorphism
                                                    ≃    u
                       PWR (G, τ, P ) −→                     PWR (G, τ, P ).

Proof. It follows from Lemma 5.3 that the functions λ 7→ CP |P (1: −λ̄)∗±1 belong
to M(a∗0C , Σ)⊗ End(A2 ), so that the map UP restricts to a linear automorphism
of the space M(a∗0C , Σ) ⊗ A2 . It follows from Lemma 7.2 that transposition
induces an automorphism UPt of M(a∗0C , Σ)∗laur ⊗ A∗2 .
    Let uAC(G, τ, P ) denote the space of Laurent functionals L ∈ M(a∗0C , Σ)∗laur ⊗
  ∗
A2 such that (3.3) holds for all x ∈ G and v ∈ Vτ . Then it follows from Lemma
7.3 that the natural map
                            u
                              AC(G, τ, P ) → u AChol (G, τ, P )                   (7.14)

                                                    20
is surjective.
    If L ∈ M(a∗0C , Σ)∗laur ⊗ A∗2 , then
                    L[uE ∗ (P : · : x)v] = L ◦ UP [E ∗ (P : · : x)v],
for all x ∈ G and v ∈ Vτ . It follows that UPt restricts to a linear isomorphism
from uAC(G, τ, P ) onto the space AC(G, τ, P ).
     Let MAC (a∗0C , Σ, P ) denote the space of ϕ ∈ M(a∗0C , Σ) ⊗ A2 such that
Lϕ = 0 for all L ∈ AC(G, τ, P ). Similarly, let MuAC (a∗0C , Σ, P ) denote the
space of ϕ ∈ M(a∗0C , Σ) ⊗ A2 such that Lϕ = 0 for all L ∈ uAC(G, τ, P ).
Then it follows from the above that UP defines a linear isomorphism from
MAC (a∗0C , Σ, P ) onto MuAC (a∗0C , Σ, P ). The latter of the two spaces consists of
holomorphic functions, by Lemma 7.4, applied with S consisting of the functions
uE ∗ (P : · : x)v, for x ∈ G and v ∈ V . By surjectivity of the map (7.14) it follows
                                          τ
that MuAC (a∗0C , Σ, P ) equals the space OuAC (a∗0C , P ) of ϕ ∈ O(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 with
Lϕ = 0 for all L ∈ u AChol (G, τ, P ).
     We conclude that UP defines a linear isomorphism from MAC (a∗0C , Σ, P )
onto OuAC (a∗0C , P ). Only the estimates remain to be taken care of.
     Let ω ⊂ a∗0 be a bounded open subset. Applying Lemma 7.4 with S con-
sisting of all functions E ∗ (P : · : x), for x ∈ G and with Ω = ω + ia∗0 and
ψ = πω,d ⊗ I, we see that for every ϕ ∈ MAC (a∗0C , Σ, P ) the function πω,d ϕ is
holomorphic on ω +ia∗0 . This implies that MAC (a∗0C , Σ, P ) ⊂ M(a∗0C , H, d)⊗A2 .
     Again, let ω ⊂ a∗0 be a bounded open subset. Then ω + ia∗0 ⊂ a∗0 (P, r) for
a suitable real number r. By Lemma 5.2, there exists a polynomial p ∈ ΠΣ (a∗0 )
such that λ 7→ p(λ)CP |P (1 : −λ̄)∗ is holomorphic on a∗0 (P, r). Moreover, by
application of the same lemma, there exist N ∈ N and C > 0 such that, for
every n ∈ Z,
                          νω,n (p πω,d UP ϕ) ≤ Cνω,n+N (πω,d ϕ)
for all ϕ ∈ M(a∗0C , H, d)⊗ A2 . On the other hand, let ω0 be a relatively compact
subset of ω. Then, by an easy application of Cauchy’s integral formula, there
exists for every n ∈ Z a constant Cn > 0, such that
                             νω0 ,n (ψ) ≤ Cn νω,n (pπω,d ψ)
for all ψ ∈ M(a∗0C , H, d) ⊗ A2 that are regular on ω + ia∗0 . It follows that
                          νω0 ,n (UP ϕ) ≤ Cn C νω,d,n+N (ϕ),
for all ϕ ∈ PAC (a∗0C , H, d, P ). This implies that UP maps PAC (a∗0C , H, d, P ) con-
tinuous linearly into P(a∗0C , ∅)⊗A2 , hence also continuously into PuAC (a∗0C , ∅, P ).
Moreover, the same statement holds for the spaces with superscript ∗. By a sim-
ilar argument, involving Lemma 5.2 for the inverse of the C-function, it follows
that UP−1 maps PuAC (a∗0C , ∅, P ) continuous linearly into PAC (a∗0C , H, d, P ). A
similar statement is true for the spaces with the superscript ∗.
    Finally, using Lemma 5.2 once more in the above fashion, it follows that
a function ϕ ∈ PAC (a∗0C , H, d, P ) satisfies the estimate (7.9) for all n ∈ N if
and only if UP ϕ satisfies the estimate (7.11) for all n ∈ N. If we combine this
with Proposition 7.7 (a), we see that UP restricts to a topological linear iso-
morphism from PWR (G, τ, P ) onto u PWR (G, τ, P ). The analogous statements
for the spaces with the superscript ∗ are proved in a similar fashion.               


                                           21
8    The group as a symmetric space
We retain the notation of the previous sections. In this section we will view the
group G as a symmetric space, and compare the Fourier transforms and Paley–
Wiener spaces for G with those for the associated symmetric space. This will
allow us to deduce the Paley–Wiener theorems for the group from the analogous
theorems for symmetric spaces.
     As G is of the Harish-Chandra class, the group ∗G: = G × G is of this
class as well. We consider the involution ∗ σ of ∗G defined by ∗ σ(x, y) = (y, x).
Its group of fixed points, the diagonal subgroup, is denoted by ∗H. The space
∗ X: = ∗G/∗H is a reductive symmetric space of the Harish-Chandra class. The
map ∗G → G given by (x, y) 7→ xy −1 induces a diffeomorphism

                             p:   ∗   X: = ∗G/∗H −→ G,                          (8.1)

intertwining the natural left action of ∗G with the action of ∗G on G given
by (x, y)g = xgy −1 . Accordingly, G becomes a reductive symmetric space of
the Harish-Chandra class. We fix a choice of Haar measure dg on G; then
dx = p∗ (dg) is a choice of ∗G-invariant measure on ∗ X.
    The map ∗θ: = (θ, θ) is a Cartan involution of ∗G which commutes with ∗ σ.
The associated maximal compact subgroup equals ∗K: = K × K. We recall that
τ = (τ1 , τ2 ) is a double unitary representation of K in Vτ and define the unitary
representation of ∗K in Vτ by ∗τ (k1 , k2 )v = τ (k1 )vτ (k2 )−1 . Then pull-back by
p induces a topological linear isomorphism
                                            ≃
                      p∗ : C −∞ (G : τ ) −→ C −∞ (∗ X : ∗τ ),                   (8.2)

which we shall also denote by f 7→ ∗ f . Clearly this isomorphism restricts to an
isomorphism between the subspaces indicated by Cc−∞ , C ∞ and Cc∞ .
    The −1 eigenspaces of ∗θ and ∗ σ in ∗ g equal ∗ p: = p × p and ∗ q: = {(X, −X) |
X ∈ g}, respectively. It follows that a maximal abelian subspace ∗aq of ∗ p ∩ ∗ q
is given by
                           ∗aq : = {(X, −X) | X ∈ a0 }.


The derivative of p equals the isomorphism ∗ g/∗ h → g induced by the map
g × g → g, (X, Y ) 7→ X − Y ; we will denote this derivative by p as well. The
map p restricts to the isomorphism from ∗aq onto a0 given by (X, −X) 7→ 2X.
Via pull-back under the isomorphism p, we transfer the given inner product on
a0 to an inner product on ∗aq . Accordingly, for every R > 0 the closed ball ∗ B̄R
of center 0 and radius R in ∗aq is mapped onto the similar ball B̄R in a0 . It
follows that p: ∗ X → G maps ∗ XR : = ∗K exp ∗ B̄R ∗H onto GR = K B̄R K. The
following result is now obvious.

Lemma 8.1 Let R > 0. The map p∗ , defined in (8.2), restricts to a topological
                            −∞                −∞
linear isomorphism from CR     (G : τ ) onto CR  (∗ X : ∗τ ), and, similarly, to a
                                        ∞
topological linear isomorphism from CR (G : τ ) onto CR ∞ ( X : τ ).
                                                            ∗   ∗


    We will now compare the definition of the normalized Eisenstein integral for
(∗ X, ∗τ ) given in [3], Sect. 2, with the one for (G, τ ) given in the present paper.

                                           22
The isometry p: ∗aq → a0 induces an isometry p∗ : a∗0 → ∗ a∗q (for the dual inner
products on these spaces). The complex linear extension of this map is denoted
by p∗ : λ 7→ ∗ λ, a∗0C → ∗ a∗qC .
    The system ∗ Σ of restricted roots of ∗aq in ∗ g consists of the roots 12 ∗ α, for
α ∈ Σ. The root space for the root 21 ∗ α is given by gα × {0} ⊕ {0} × g−α . Thus,
if P ∈ P0 then ∗P : = P × P̄ belongs to the set ∗ Pσmin of minimal ∗ σ ∗θ-stable
parabolic subgroups of ∗G containing ∗ Aq ; the associated system of positive
roots is ∗ Σ(∗P ) = { 12 ∗ α | α ∈ Σ(P )}. As usual, let ρ∗P ∈ ∗ a∗q be defined by

                                           1
                            ρ∗P ( · ): =     tr (ad( · )|n∗P ).
                                           2
Then ρ∗P = ∗ (ρP ). Thus, without ambiguity, we may use the notation ∗ ρP for
this functional.
    Via the isometry ∗aq ≃ a0 we see that every element of the Weyl group of ∗ Σ
can be realized by an element of ∗K ∩ ∗H = diag(K). It follows that the coset
space ∗ W/∗ W∗K∩∗H consists of one element. Thus as a set of representatives
for this coset space in the normalizer of ∗aq in ∗K we may fix ∗ W = {e}.
Accordingly, the space ◦ C(∗τ ) of [3], Eqn. (17), now denoted by ∗ A2 , is given
by
                        ∞
             ∗ A2 : = C   (∗ M/∗ M ∩ ∗H : ∗τ ) = L2 (∗ M/∗ M ∩ ∗H : ∗τ ).
We equip the space ∗ M/∗ M ∩ ∗H with the pull-back of the invariant measure
on M0 under the analogue of the map (8.1) for the tuple (M0 , τ0 ), and the
space ∗ A2 with the associated L2 -type inner product. Then the analogue of the
isomorphism (8.2) for the tuple (M0 , τ0 ) gives a unitary isomorphism

                             p∗ : ψ 7→ ∗ ψ, A2 → ∗ A2 .

Given ψ ∈ A2 , we define the Eisenstein integral E(∗P : ∗ψ : ∗ λ) as in [3], Eqn.
(20). Then we have the following relation with the Eisenstein integral defined
in (2.3).

Lemma 8.2 Let P ∈ P0 , ψ ∈ A2 . Then for every (x, y) ∈ ∗G,

            E(∗P : ∗ψ : ∗ λ)(x, y) = E(P : CP̄ |P (1: −λ̄)∗ ψ : λ)(xy −1 ),     (8.3)

as an identity of meromorphic functions in the variable λ ∈ a∗0C .

Proof. We briefly write N = NP . Let λ ∈ a∗0C be such that Re λ + ρP is P̄ -
dominant. Then Re ∗ λ + ∗ ρP is ∗ P̄ -dominant. Let ∗ ψ̃(∗ λ): ∗G → Vτ be defined
as in [3], Eqn. (17), for the situation at hand. Then ∗ ψ̃(∗ λ) = 0 outside ∗P ∗H
and
                                       −1
                ∗ ψ̃(∗ λ : nam1 g , n̄a   m2 g) = a2λ+2ρP ψ(m1 m−1
                                                                2 ),

for n ∈ N, n̄ ∈ N̄ , a ∈ A0 , m1 , m2 ∈ M0 and g ∈ G. It follows that ∗ ψ̃(∗ λ) =
∗ [ψ̃(λ)], where ψ̃(λ): G → Vτ is defined to be zero outside N A0 M0 N̄ and


                            ψ̃(λ : namn̄) = aλ+ρP ψ(m)


                                            23
for (n, a, m, n̄) ∈ N × A0 × M0 × N̄ . In view of [3], Eqn. (20), we now infer that

              E(∗P : ∗ψ : ∗ λ : (x1 , x2 )) =
                   Z
                                         −1
               =            ∗τ (k1 , k2 )   ∗ ψ̃(∗ λ : k1 x1 , k2 x2 ) dk1 dk2
                     K×K
                   Z
               =            τ (k1 )−1 ψ̃(λ : k1 x1 x−1     −1
                                                       2 k2 )τ (k2 ) dk1 dk2
                       K×K
                 = E(P : Ψ(λ) : λ : x1 x−1
                                        2 ),                                     (8.4)

see (2.3), where the function Ψ(λ): M0 → Vτ is defined by
                                 Z
                      Ψ(λ : m) =    ψ̃(λ : mk−1 )τ (k) dk.                       (8.5)
                                        K

As M0 normalizes N̄ , the function ψ̃(λ) transforms according to ψ̃(λ : xm) =
ψ̃(λ : x)τ (m), for x ∈ G and m ∈ M0 . It follows that the integrand in (8.5) is a
left M0 -invariant measurable function on K. We now consider the real analytic
map (κ, H, ν): G → K × a0 × N determined by

                       x = κ(x) exp H(x)ν(x),             (x ∈ G).               (8.6)

Then the Haar measure dn̄ may be normalized such that for every ϕ ∈ C(K/M0 )
we have           Z             Z
                     ϕ(k) dk =      ϕ(κ(n̄)) e−2ρP H(n̄) dn̄.
                       K                N̄
We apply this substitution of variables to the integral (8.5). Since κ(n̄) =
n̄ν(n̄)−1 exp[−H(n̄)], whereas ψ̃(λ) is right N̄ -invariant, it follows that
               Z
    Ψ(λ, m) =     ehλ−ρP , H(n̄)i ψ(m)τ (κ(n̄)) dn̄ = [CP̄ |P (1 : −λ̄)∗ ψ](m). (8.7)
                 N̄

The last equality follows from [14], §19, Thm. 1, since τ is unitary (take Remark
5.1 into account). In the notation of [14], we have µP = 0 since P is minimal.
    Combining (8.4) with (8.7) we obtain the desired identity for λ ∈ a∗0C such
that Re λ + ρP is P̄ -dominant. Now apply analytic continuation.               

Remark 8.3 With the same method of proof it can be shown that Lemma 8.2
generalizes to arbitrary parabolic subgroups of G. In the more general lemma,
the expression on the left-hand side is defined as in Harish–Chandra’s work,
taking account of Remark 2.1. Moreover, the Eisenstein integral on the right-
hand side is defined as in [10], p. 61, with λ in place of −λ. In the proof
one has to replace the decomposition (8.6) by the decomposition induced by
G = K exp(mP ∩ p)AP NP .

Remark 8.4 Lemma 8.2 can also be derived from [2], Lemma 1, by express-

principal series, see [3], Eqn. (25) and [13], Thm. 7.1.

Corollary 8.5 Let P ∈ P0 , ψ ∈ A2 . Then

                       E ◦ (∗P : p∗ ψ : ∗ λ) = p∗ (E ◦ (P : ψ : λ)),                 (8.8)

as an identity of meromorphic functions in the variable λ ∈ a∗0C .

Proof. In (8.3) we substitute x1 = m1 a and x2 = m2 a−1 for m1 , m2 ∈ M0 A0
and a ∈ A0 . Comparing coefficients in the asymptotic expansions of type (5.1)
for both sides, as a → ∞ in A+         P , we obtain that p
                                                            ∗−1 ◦ C
                                                                   ∗P | ∗P
                                                                           (1 : ∗ λ) ◦ p∗ =
CP |P (1 : λ)CP̄ |P (1 : −λ̄)∗ . The result now follows from Lemma 8.2 if we apply
the definitions of the normalized Eisenstein integrals, see (7.1) and [3], Eqn.
(49).                                                                                     
   We can now formulate the relation between the Fourier transforms for G
and those for the associated symmetric space ∗ X; for the definition of the latter,
we refer to [3], Eqn. (59). We define the linear isomorphism
                                                 ≃
                      p∗ : M(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 −→ M(∗ a∗qC ) ⊗ ∗ A2                        (8.9)

by p∗ (ψ)(∗ λ) = p∗ [ψ(λ)], for ψ ∈ M(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 and for generic λ ∈ a∗0C .

Lemma 8.6 Let P ∈ P0 . Then the following diagram commutes:
                                            p∗
                        Cc−∞ (G : τ )    −→          Cc−∞ (∗ X : ∗τ )
                           FP ↓                          ↓ F∗P
                                            p∗
                       M(a∗0C ) ⊗ A2 −→ M(∗ a∗qC ) ⊗ ∗ A2 .

Proof. Let f ∈ Cc−∞ (G : τ ) and put ∗ f : = p∗ (f ) ∈ Cc−∞ (∗ X : ∗τ ). Let ψ ∈ A2 .
Then it follows by application of Corollary 8.5 and the fact that dx = p∗ (dg)
that
                                  Z
         hF∗P (∗ f )(∗ λ) , ∗ψi =      h∗ f (x) , E ◦ (∗P : ∗ψ : −∗ λ̄ : x)i dx
                                  Z∗ X
                                =    hf (g) , E ◦ (P : ψ : −λ̄ : g)i dg
                                        G
                                  = hFP f (λ) , ψi = h∗ [FP f (λ)] , ∗ψi.

In the last equality we have used that p∗ : ψ 7→ ∗ψ is a unitary isomorphism
from A2 onto ∗ A2 . Using the definition of the map (8.9) we conclude that
F[∗P ] ◦ p∗ (f ) = p∗ ◦ FP f.                                              
    The map p∗ : λ 7→ ∗ λ is a linear isomorphism from a∗0 onto ∗ a∗q , mapping
the set Σ onto 2∗ Σ. It follows that the map p∗ in (8.9) maps M(a∗0C , Σ) ⊗ A2
isomorphically onto M(∗ a∗qC , ∗ Σ) ⊗ ∗ A2 . Moreover, the transpose of its inverse
restricts to a linear isomorphism
                                                 ≃
               p∗ : M(a∗0C , Σ)∗laur ⊗ A∗2 −→ M(∗ a∗qC , ∗ Σ)∗laur ⊗ ∗ A∗2 ,        (8.10)

which we shall also denote by L 7→ ∗ L.

Lemma 8.7 The isomorphism (8.10) maps AC(G, τ, P ) onto AC(∗ X, ∗τ , ∗P ).

                                             25
Proof. Let (x, y) ∈ G × G and v ∈ Vτ . We consider the functions f : µ 7→
E ∗ (∗P : µ : (x, y))v and g: λ 7→ E ∗ (P : λ : xy −1 )v, where the first dual Eisenstein
integral is defined in a fashion analogous to (7.2), see [5], Eqn. (2.3).
     It follows from Corollary 8.5 that f = p∗ g. Thus, for every L ∈ M(a∗0C )∗laur ⊗
A∗2 we have that p∗ (L)f = ∗ L∗ g = Lg. It follows from this that L ∈ AC(G, τ, P )
if and only if p∗ (L) ∈ AC(∗ X : ∗τ : ∗P ). The result follows.                        
    Let P ∈ P0 and R > 0. We define the Paley–Wiener space PWR (∗ X : ∗τ : ∗P )
as in [7], Def. 3.4. The mentioned definition depends on a choice of positive
roots, which we take to be ∗ Σ(∗P ). We enlarge this space to a distributional
Paley–Wiener space PW∗R (∗ X : ∗τ : ∗P ) in complete analogy with the way in
which (b) enlarges (a) in Definition 7.6.

Theorem 8.8 Let P ∈ P0 and R > 0. The map (8.9) restricts to a topological
linear isomorphism
                                                ≃
                     p∗ : PW∗R (G, τ, P ) −→ PW∗R (∗ X, ∗τ , ∗P )                 (8.11)

and to a similar isomorphism between the spaces without the superscript ∗.

Remark 8.9 The definition of PWR (∗ X, ∗τ , ∗P ) in [7], Def. 3.4, is not com-
pletely analogous to Definition 7.6 (a), as the definition in [7] invokes only the
relations determined by the space ACR (∗ X, τ, P ) of Arthur–Campoli function-
als with real support; see also [7], Def. 3.2. However, it follows by application
of [7], Thm. 3.6, that the functions in the Paley–Wiener space thus defined
satisfy all remaining Arthur–Campoli relations as well. Consequently, [7], Def.
3.4, determines the same Paley–Wiener space as the analogue of Definition 7.6
for the triple (∗ X, ∗τ , ∗P ). A similar remark can be made for the distributional
Paley–Wiener space.
    It follows from these observations, combined with the results of this paper,
that the Paley–Wiener spaces introduced in Definitions 3.2, 3.5 and 7.6 remain
unaltered if only the Arthur–Campoli functionals with real support are invoked.

Proof. We define the hyperplane configuration ∗ H = ∗ H∗ X,∗τ ,∗P and the map
∗d = d∗ X,∗τ ,∗P as in [7], text following Lemma 2.1. In view of the relation
between the dual Eisenstein integrals, it follows that p∗ (H) = H and that
d∗ = d ◦ p∗ . This implies that the map p∗ introduced in (8.9) restricts to a
topological linear isomorphism

                          P ∗ (a∗0C , H, d) → P ∗ (∗ a∗qC , ∗ H, ∗ d),

and to a similar isomorphism between the spaces without the superscript ∗. In
view of Lemma 8.7 these isomorphisms restrict to isomorphisms of the closed
subspaces with index AC.
    Let ∗ π be defined as π in [7], for the tuple (∗ X, ∗τ ) and the positive system
   +
∗Σ   = ∗ Σ(∗P ). Then it follows from the relation between the dual Eisenstein
integrals that ∗ π = p∗ (π), possibly up to a nonzero constant factor, which we
may ignore here. As p∗ : a∗0 → ∗ a∗q , λ 7→ ∗ λ, is an isometry, it follows that

                            π(λ)eR|Re λ| = ∗ π(∗ λ)eR|Re ∗ λ| .

                                              26
Moreover, from p∗ (Σ(P )) = 2∗ Σ(∗P ) it follows that ∗ a∗q (∗P , 0) = p∗ (a∗0 (P, 0)).
                           (∗)
Thus, a function ϕ ∈ PAC (a∗0C , H, d) satisfies an estimate of type (7.9) (or of
type (7.10)) if and only if the function p∗ (ϕ) satisfies the analogous estimate
for the triple (∗ X, ∗τ , ∗P ). The result now follows in view of Remark 8.9.  
    It follows from Lemma 8.6 combined with Lemma 8.1 and Theorem 8.8 that
FP is a topological linear isomorphism CR  ∞ (G : τ ) → PW (G, τ, P ) if and only
                                                             R
if F∗P is a topological linear isomorphism CR    ∞ ( X : τ ) → PW ( X, τ , P ).
                                                     ∗  ∗            R ∗   ∗   ∗
In view of the results of Section 7, it now follows that Theorem 3.6, hence
Arthur’s Paley–Wiener theorem, is a consequence of [7], Thm. 3.6. Similarly, it
follows from the Paley–Wiener theorem proved in [8] that FP is a topological
                            −∞
linear isomorphism from CR     (G : τ ) onto PW∗R (G, τ, P ). Thus, the validity of
Theorem 4.2 follows from the main result of [8].
