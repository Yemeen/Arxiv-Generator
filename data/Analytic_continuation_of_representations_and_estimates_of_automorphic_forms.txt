                                                                             0. Introduction

                                                 0.1. Analytic vectors and their analytic continuation. Let G be a Lie
                                            group and (π, G, V ) a continuous representation of G in a topological vector
                                            space V . A vector v ∈ V is called analytic if the function ξv : g 7→ π(g)v is
                                            a real analytic function on G with values in V . This means that there exists
                                            a neighborhood U of G in its complexification GC such that ξv extends to a
                                            holomorphic function on U . In other words, for each element g ∈ U we can
                                            unambiguously define the vector π(g)v as ξv (g), i.e., we can extend the action
                                            of G to a somewhat larger set. In this paper we will show that the possibility
                                            of such an extension sometimes allows one to prove some highly nontrivial
                                            estimates.
                                                 Unless otherwise stated, G = SL(2, R), so GC = SL(2, C). We consider a
                                            typical representation of G, i.e., a representation of the principal series. Namely,
                                            fix λ ∈ C and consider the space Dλ of smooth homogeneous functions of degree
                                            λ − 1 on R2 \ 0, i.e., Dλ = {φ ∈ C ∞ (R2 \ 0) : φ(ax, ay) = |a|λ−1 φ(x, y)}; we
                                            denote by (πλ , G, Dλ ) the natural representation of G in the space Dλ .
                                                 Restriction to S 1 gives an isomorphism Dλ ≃ Ceven     ∞ (S 1 ), and for basis

                                            vectors of Dλ one can take the vectors ek = exp(2ikθ). If λ = it, then    R (πλ , D λ)
                                                                                                              2    1          2
                                            is a unitary representation of G with the invariant norm ||φ|| = 2π S 1 |φ| dθ.
                                                 Consider the vector v = e0 ∈ Dλ . We claim that v is an analytic vector and
                                            we want to exhibit a large set of elements g ∈ GC for which the expression π(g)v
                                                                                                                      λ−1
                                            makes sense. The vector v is represented by the function (x2 + y 2 ) 2 ∈ Dλ .
                                            For any a > 0 consider the diagonal matrix ga = diag(a−1 , a). Then
                                                                                                             λ−1
                                                                 ξv (ga ) = πλ (ga )v = (a2 x2 + a−2 y 2 )    2    .

                                                  This last expression makes sense as a vector in Dλ for any complex a such
                                            that |arg(a)| < π4 (since in this case Re (a2 x2 + a−2 y 2 ) > 0). Hence, we see
                                            that the function ξv extends analytically to the subset I = {ga : |arg(a)|
                                            < π4 } ⊂ SL(2, C).
                                                  The same argument shows that the function ξv extends analytically to
                                            the domain U = SL(2, R) · I · KC ⊂ SL(2, C) (open in the usual topology),

where K = SO(2, R) and KC = SO(2, C) ≃ C∗ ; thus, for any g ∈ U we
unambiguously define the vector π(g)v.
     As g approaches the boundary of U , the vector π(g)v ∈ Dλ has very
specific asymptotic behavior that we will use in order to obtain information
about this vector.

      0.2. Triple products. Let us describe an application of the principle of
analytic continuation to a problem in the theory of automorphic functions.
Namely, we will show how to apply the principle in order to settle a conjecture
of Peter Sarnak on triple products. As a corollary of our result we will get a
new bound on Fourier coefficients of cusp forms.
      Recall the setting. Let H be the upper half-plane with the hyperbolic
metric of constant curvature −1. We consider the natural action of the group
G = SL(2, R) on H and identify H with G/K by means of this action.
      Fix a lattice Γ ⊂ G and consider the Riemann surface Y = Γ \ H. In
this paper we will discuss both cocompact and noncocompact lattices of finite
covolume. For simplicity of exposition, in most of the paper we will only discuss
the cocompact case. Then in Section 4 we will describe how to overcome the
extra difficulties in case of noncocompact lattices.
      The Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆ acts on the space of functions on Y.
When Y is compact it has discrete spectrum; we denote by µ0 < µ1 ≤ . . .
its eigenvalues on Y and by φi the corresponding eigenfunctions. (We assume
that φi are L2 normalized: ||φi || = 1.) These functions φi are usually called
automorphic functions or Maass forms (see [B]).
      To state the problem about triple products, fix one automorphic function,
φ, and consider the function φ2 on Y . Since φ2 is not an eigenfunction, it is
not an automorphic function. Since φ2 ∈ L2 (Y ), we may consider its spectral
decomposition in the basis {φi }:
                                       X
                                  φ2 =     ci φi .

Here
R      the coefficients are given by the triple product integrals: ci = hφ2 , φi i =
  X φ · φ · φi dx. Later we will explain why these triple products are of interest
and how they are related to the theory of Rankin-Selberg L-functions (see also
[S], which was our starting point).
                                                                   √
     Claim. The coefficients ci decay exponentially as exp(− π2 µi ).
                                                                               1−λ2
     More precisely, let us introduce new parameters λi such that µi = 4 i
(the meaning of this parametrization will become clear in subsection 0.3).
Introduce new (normalized) coefficients bi = |ci |2 exp( π2 |λi |). The main result
of the paper is the proof of the following theorem which settles a conjecture of
P. Sarnak (see [S]):

     Theorem. There exists a constant C > 0 such that
                   X
                         bi ≤ C · (ln T )3 as T → ∞ .
                        |λi |≤T


     Corollary. There exists a constant C > 0 such that

      Remarks. 1. The bound in the theorem is essentially sharp. Namely,
                                                                   P∞         −ε|λi | ≥
our method gives the following lower bound on the average:            i=1 bi e
c| ln ε|.
      For a single triple product we cannot do better than the bound in the
corollary.
      For congruence subgroups we can speculate about the true “size” of these
triple products. It is known (see 0.6) that in certain cases the ci are equal (up to
an explicit factor) to the value of the triple Garrett L-function at 21 . For these
L-functions, the Lindelöf conjecture predicts bi ≪ |λi |−2+ε . This is consistent
with our bound together with the Weyl law: the number of eigenfunctions with
|λi | ≤ T is proportional to T 2 .
     2. We will prove similar results for nonuniform lattices (see §4).
     3. This type of question has been considered before. The first result on ex-
ponential decay of the coefficients ci for a holomorphic cusp form φ was proven
by A. Good ([G]) for the general (i.e., nonarithmetic) nonuniform lattices Γ
thanks to a special feature of holomorphic Poincaré series. Recently, M. Jutila
([J]) extended these results to the nonholomorphic case (Maass forms), but
only for the group SL(2, Z), using Kuznetsov’s formula and nontrivial arith-
metic information (Weil’s bounds on Kloosterman’s sums and deep results of
Iwaniec). In particular, all these methods work only for nonuniform lattices.
     In [S], P. Sarnak introduced a new method to estimate the triple products
based on analytic continuation of certain matrix coefficients of the function
φ; this method works for uniform lattices as well. Being partly based on the
theory of spherical harmonics, it led to a weaker bound (by a power of T ).
     Our method, in addition to the analytic continuation, uses more sophis-
ticated representation theory, in particular, an idea of G-invariant norms on
representations and gives the optimal result (possibly, up to a power of loga-
rithm).
    4. Our method gives a more general result than Theorem 0.2. We can
obtain similar logarithmic bounds for any polynomial expression in any finite
number of automorphic functions φk instead of φ2 , as above.

     5. One can ask the same question about growth of triple products for
polynomial expressions in automorphic functions of nonzero weight. In this
case the decay is also exponential with the same exponent as in Claim 0.2, but
the bound in the analogue of Theorem 0.2 is a power of T and not logarithmic
as above.

     The main interest in triple products and their bounds stems from their
relation to the theory of automorphic L-functions. We will discuss this relation
in 0.6. We also show in 0.7 that Theorem 0.2 implies a new bound on the
Fourier coefficients of automorphic functions in the case of nonuniform lattices.

      0.3. Automorphic representations. To explain our method, we first recall
the relation of automorphic functions to automorphic representations of G.
      For a given lattice Γ in G we denote by X the quotient space X = Γ \ G.
The group G acts on X, hence, on the space of functions on X. We can identify
H with G/K. Then the Riemann surface Y = Γ \ H is identified with X/K.
This induces an isometric embedding L2 (Y ) ⊂ L2 (X), the image consisting of
all K-invariant functions.
      For any eigenfunction φ of the Laplace operator ∆ on Y we consider the
closed G-invariant subspace Lφ ⊂ L2 (X) generated by φ under the G-action.
It is known that (π, L) = (πφ , Lφ ) is an irreducible unitary representation of
G (see [G6]).
      Conversely, fix an irreducible unitary representation (π, L) of the group
G and a K-fixed unit vector v0 ∈ L. Then any G-morphism ν : L → L2 (X)
defines an eigenfunction φ = ν(v0 ) of ∆ on Y ; if ν is an isometric embedding,
then ||φ|| = 1. Thus, the eigenfunctions φ correspond to the tuples (π, L, v0 , ν).
      Usually it is more convenient to work with smooth vectors. Let V =
  ∞
L be the subspace of smooth vectors in L. Then ν gives a morphism
ν : V → (L2 (X))∞ ⊂ C ∞ (X). If X is compact, then MorG (L, L2 (X)) ≃
MorG (V, C ∞ (X)).       Thus, the eigenfunctions correspond to the tuples
(π, V, v0 , ν : V → C ∞ (X)).
      All irreducible unitary representations of G with K-fixed vector are clas-
sified: these are representations of the principal and complementary series and
the trivial representation. For simplicity, consider representations of the prin-
cipal series only. In this case the representation (π, V ) in the space of smooth
vectors is isomorphic to the representation (πλ , Dλ ) for some λ = it (see 0.1).
                                                                              2
The eigenvalue of the corresponding automorphic function equals µ = 1−λ      4 .

       0.4. The method. We describe here the idea behind the proof of Theorem
0.2.
    Let Li ⊂ L2 (X) be the space corresponding to the automorphic function
φi as above (see 0.3). Let pri : L2 (X) → Li be the orthogonal projection.
                             ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                                333

Since the function φ2 is K-invariant and there is at most one K-fixed vector
in each irreducible representation of SL(2, R), we have pri (φ2 ) = ci φi .
     Since the G-action commutes with the multiplication of functions on X,

                   pri ((π(g)φ)2 ) = pri (π(g)(φ2 )) = ci πi (g)φi .

     By the principle of analytic continuation, the same identity holds for the
complex points g ∈ U (see 0.1). Since all the spaces Li are orthogonal, we get
the following basic relation for the complex points g:
                                       X
(0.4.1)               ||(π(g)φ)2 ||2 =   |ci |2 ||πi (g)φi ||2 .
                                          i

Here || · || = || · ||L2 denotes the L2 -norm in L2 (X).
     It is important that in (0.4.1) we deal with complex points g and for such g
the operators π(g) are nonunitary. As a result, relation (0.4.1) gives nontrivial
information.
     Now, consider the behavior of the function (π(g)φ)2 near the boundary
of U . Take ε > 0 and an element gε ∈ U which is approximately at the
distance ε from the boundary of U . For example, set gε = diag(a−1    ε , aε ) for
aε = exp(( π4 − ε)i).
     With shorthand notation, vε = π(gε )e0 and φε = ν(vε ), formula (0.4.1)
becomes
                                           X
(0.4.2)                        ||φ2ε ||2 =   |ci |2 ||φi,ε ||2 .

    Our goal is to give an upper bound on the left-hand side of (0.4.2) and a
lower bound of each of the ||φi,ε ||2 as i → ∞ and ε → 0. The latter problem is
simpler since it is invariantly defined in terms of representation theory; thus it
can be computed in any model of the representation πi (e.g., in Dλi ). A direct
computation gives
                                        π
                  ||φi,ε ||2 ≥ c · exp(( − ε)|λi |) for some c > 0.
                                        2
     On the other hand, we will prove the bound kφ2ε k ≪ |ln ε|3 . These two
bounds easily imply Theorem 0.2 (see 2.3).
     The last bound follows from the bound |φε (x)| ≤ C| ln ε| which holds
pointwise on X and which we consider to be our main achievement in this
paper. Its proof is based on the use of invariant norms which we now explain.

    0.5. Invariant norms. The most difficult part of the proof is that of the
                                                                                   1
pointwise bound |φε | ≤ C| ln ε|. Note that the L2 -norm of φε is of order | ln ε| 2 ;
hence, the pointwise bound only differs from it by a power of logarithm.
    In order to obtain such a bound, we use invariant (non-Hermitian!) norms
on the representation π. Namely, as we have explained, any automorphic
334                JOSEPH BERNSTEIN AND ANDRE REZNIKOV


function gives rise to an embedding ν : Dλ → C ∞ (X). We consider the
supremum norm Nsup on Dλ induced by ν:

                             Nsup (v) = sup |ν(v)(x)|.
                                         x∈X

For a discussion of Lp -norms on X see Appendix A.
     From the Sobolev restriction theorem on X (for more details see Appendix
B), it follows that Nsup is bounded by some Sobolev norm S = Sk on the space
Dλ . Hence, the main properties of the norm Nsup are: it is G-invariant and
Nsup ≤ S.
     We will show that there exists a maximal norm S G on the space Dλ satis-
fying these two conditions. This norm is defined in terms of the representation
πλ only and it is independent of the automorphic form picture.
     We then use the model Dλ of πλ in order to prove the bound S G (vε ) ≤
C| ln ε|. The proof uses the standard method of dyadic decomposition from
harmonic analysis; it is based on the observation that, in Dλ , the vector vε is
represented by a function which is roughly homogeneous.
     As a result we get a pointwise bound

(0.5)         sup |φε | = Nsup (vε ) ≤ S G (vε ) ≤ C| ln ε| as   ε → 0.

     Remark. A new feature of our method, which seems to be absent in the
classical approaches to automorphic forms, is the essential use of representation
theory.
     First of all, in order to study the automorphic function φ that lives on the
space Y , we pass to a bigger space, X, and work directly with the representa-
tion (π, G, V ) ⊂ C ∞ (X) which corresponds to φ.
     In some classical approaches, the space V is actually also present, albeit
very implicitly. And when present, it appears only as a collection of vectors
π(h)φ created from the automorphic function φ by operators π(h) correspond-
ing to various functions (or distributions) h on G. Though, in principle, one
can show that such functions exhaust V , in most cases it is very difficult to
work with such an implicit description.
     In this paper we directly use the space V in order to prove Theorem 0.2.
For example, the central technical result is the pointwise bound of the function
u = φε ∈ V . This bound is proven in Section 5 by means of dyadic decom-
position. The idea of the method is to break the function u into the sum of
“pieces” ui ∈ V which we can move to a better position (for more detail see
§§5.2).
     We describe these ui using the explicit model Dλ of V . We do not know
how to realize the ui ’s in the form π(h)φ. So we do not see how to prove this
crucial estimate without using the space V as a whole.

     0.6. Relation to L-functions. The main interest in triple products and
their bounds stems from their relation to the theory of automorphic L-func-
tions. A particular case of these triple products is the scalar product of φ2 with
the Eisenstein series E(s). This is the original example of Rankin and Selberg
of the L-function associated to two cusp forms (see [B]). Namely, L(φ ⊗ φ, s) =
g(s)hφ2 , E(s)i, where g(s) is an explicit factor.
     M. Harris and S. Kudla ([HK]) discovered that such triple products are
related to the special value at s = 12 of L(φ⊗φ⊗φi , s). This gives further reason
for the study of such triple products, at least when φ and φi are holomorphic
cusp forms for a congruence subgroup of a division algebra.

     0.7. Bounds on Fourier coefficients of cusp forms. As we mentioned
above, our result implies certain bounds for the Rankin-Selberg L-functions
on the critical line. This, in turn, has implication for the classical problem of
obtaining bounds of the Fourier coefficients of cusp forms.
     Recall the setting (see [Se], [G], [S]). Let Γ be a nonuniform lattice in
SL(2, R), which can be nonarithmetic (the standard example of a nonuniform
lattice is Γ =SL(2, Z)).
     Let 10 11 be a generator of its unipotent subgroup. Let φ be a cusp form
                          2
with eigenvalue µ = 1−λ 4 . We have then the following Fourier decomposition
(see [B]):
                                 X        1
                     φ(x + iy) =     an y 2 K λ (2π|n|y)e2πinx ,
                                                2
                                    n6=0

where K λ is the K-Bessel function.
         2
     In order to study the coefficients an , Rankin and Selberg introduced the
                        2
series L(s) = n>0 |anns| , the Rankin-Selberg L-function (we assume that φ is
              P

real valued; hence, an = a−n ). The significance of this Dirichlet series is that
it has an integral representation and as a result a spectral interpretation (as
well as an analytic continuation!) which we will use.
     Let E(s) be the Eisenstein series associated to the cusp at ∞. The series
E(s) is unitary for Re(s) = 1/2 and
                                      2π s Γ(s)
                  L(s) =                                  hφ2 , E(s)i ;
                           Γ(s/2)2 Γ(s/2 + it)Γ(s/2 − it)
hence, our method gives an upper bound for L(s). Namely, taking into ac-
count the asymptotic behavior of the Γ-function we obtain, for example, the
following:
                    R T +1                              3
     Corollary 1. T        |L( 12 + iτ )|dτ ≪ T (ln T ) 2 .

         The Lindelöf conjecture for L(s) is stronger:         it asserts a bound
|L( 12   + iT )| ≪ T ε .
336                JOSEPH BERNSTEIN AND ANDRE REZNIKOV


    Corollary 1 implies, in turn, a bound on the coefficients an themselves via
standard methods of analytic number theory (for details, see [G], [P]):
                               1
      Corollary 2. |an | ≪ n 3 +ε for any ε > 0.
                                         1
     Remarks. 1. The bound |an | ≤ cn 2 is due to Hecke and follows from the
fact that the function φ is bounded (sometimes this is called the standard or
convexity bound).
     The Peterson-Ramanujan Conjecture is the assertion that |an | ≪ nε for
the congruence subgroups.
                                                                      5
     The best-known bound for the congruence subgroups is n 28 +ε due to
Bump-Duke-Hoffstein-Iwaniec ([B-I]).
     For nonarithmetic subgroups, however, there was no improvement over
the Hecke bound before [S] appeared. It was even suspected that the Hecke
bound might be of true order for nonarithmetic subgroups.
     Recently for the general lattice, Sarnak [S] gave the first improvement
over the Hecke bound (he treated SL(2, C), while the SL(2, R)-case was done
in [P]). Sarnak also suggested that the Peterson-Ramanujan Conjecture might
be true in this general setting. It was his idea to use the analytic continuation
which led us to think about the problem.
     2. The main point of Corollary 2 is that it holds without any assumption
on the arithmeticity of Γ.
     We would like to add that, even theoretically, the triple product method
cannot give the Peterson-Ramanujan Conjecture; indeed, even Lindelöf’s con-
                                                   1
jecture for L(s) above implies only that |an | ≪ n 4 +ε .

      The results of this paper where announced in [BR].

               1. Analytic continuation of representations

     1.1. Let G be a Lie group, (π, G, V ) its representation and v an analytic
vector in V . Then we can find a left G-invariant domain U ⊂ GC containing
G such that the function ξv : G → V given by g 7→ π(g)v has an extension
                           ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                             337

to U as a univalued holomorphic function. For the elements g ∈ U we define
the vector π(g)v to be the value of the extended function of ξv at g.
     One should be careful with the choice of U since the vector π(g)v depends
on this choice. However, having fixed U , we see that the action of G on v can
be unambiguously extended to this somewhat larger set U ⊃ G. We will see
that in many situations there is a natural choice of U which works for many
vectors v.
     It is clear that with an appropriate choice of domains of definition the
extended operators π(g) have the usual properties:

 (i) π(gh) = π(g)π(h); π(g−1 ) = π(g)−1 ;
(ii) If ν : (π, V ) → (τ, L) is a morphism of representations, then τ (g) ◦ ν =
     ν ◦ π(g);
(iii) If (ω, V ⊗ L) is the tensor product of representations (π, V ) and (τ, L),
      then ω(g) = π(g) ⊗ τ (g). If (π ∗ , V ∗ ) is the dual representation, then
      π ∗ (g) = π(g)∗ .
(iv) If (π̄, V̄ ) is the complex conjugate representation, then π(g) = π̄(ḡ). In
     particular, given a G-invariant positive definite scalar product on V we
     formally get π(g)+ = π(ḡ)−1 .

      1.2. Geometry of the domain U for SL(2, R). (See also Appendix C.) We
consider representations of the principal series of the group G = SL(2, R).
Namely, for any λ ∈ C we consider the representation (πλ , G, Dλ ); see 0.1.
      In such a realization, the K-fixed vector is the function v(x, y) = (x2 +
     λ−1
y 2 ) 2 . For convenience, we denote x2 + y 2 by Q(x, y) and will view it as a
quadratic form on C2 . Then the action of G on v is given by

(1.2)                 (π(g)v)(x, y) = (g(Q)(x, y))(λ−1)/2 .

     Let U be the open subset of GC consisting of matrices g such that the
quadratic form g(Q) on R2 has a positive definite real part. Since the function
z 7→ z (λ−1)/2 is a well-defined holomorphic function in the right half-plane
Re z > 0, we see that formula (1.2) makes sense for all g ∈ U .
     This gives us a holomorphic function on U with values in Dλ . We will
see that U is connected, so this function is the holomorphic extension of the
function ξv to the domain U . We will also show that for most λ the domain U
is the maximal domain of holomorphicity for the function ξv .
     Observe that U is left G-invariant and right KC -invariant, where KC =
SO(2, C) ≃ C∗ ⊂ SL(2, C). Let us identify GC /KC with the variety Q of
unimodular quadratic forms on C2 via g 7→ g(Q). By definition, U is the
preimage of the open subdomain Q+ ⊂ Q consisting of all quadratic forms
whose real part is positive definite.
338                  JOSEPH BERNSTEIN AND ANDRE REZNIKOV


    For every λ we have constructed a holomorphic G-equivariant function v :
Q+ → Dλ such that R 7→ vR = R(λ−1)/2 , R ∈ Q+ . The analytic continuation
π(g)v is given by π(g)v = vg(Q) .

     Remarks. 1. Note that all K-finite matrix coefficients hπ(g)e0 , en i have
an analytic extension to a much larger domain: {diag(z, z −1 ) : |arg(z)| < π2 }.
Observe a curious phenomenon: each matrix coefficient of the function π(g)e0
is holomorphic in this larger domain, but the function itself admits analytic
continuation to U only.
     For groups of higher rank the situation is much more intriguing and we
hope to return to it elsewhere.
    2. The same proof can be applied to any K-finite vector v ∈ Dλ ; it shows
that for every such vector the function ξv = π(g)v has an extension to the
same domain U ⊂ SL(2, C).


                 2. Triple products. Proof of Theorem 0.2

     Recall (see 0.2 and 0.4) that we fix an automorphic function φ and consider
the function φ2 ∈ L2 (Y ) ⊂ L2 (X). Let {φi } be the orthonormal eigenbasis
                               1−λ2
of the space L2 (Y ), ∆φi = 4 i φi . We set ci = hφ2 , φi i , bi = |ci |2 exp( π2 |λi |).
Let Li ⊂ L2 (X) be the subspace corresponding to φi . We denote by
pri : L2 (X) → Li the orthogonal projection and by L⊥ the orthogonal com-
plement to the sum of all subspaces Li in L2 (X).
     2.1. Proof of (0.4.1). Observe that the Plancherel formula gives us (0.4.1)
with an additional term on the right-hand side. The term is equal to
||π(g)(ψ)||2 , where ψ is the orthogonal projection of the function φ2 onto L⊥ .
Since L⊥ does not have K-invariant vectors, ψ = 0.
     2.2. Estimates of kφε k. Choose a family of elements gε tending to the
boundary of U . Consider the corresponding vectors vε = π(gε )v ∈ Dλ , vi,ε =
π(gε )vi ∈ Dλi and the corresponding functions φε , φi,ε on X. Observe that all
our formulas are given not in terms of the element gε (see 0.4) but in terms of
the corresponding quadratic form Qε = gε (Q) ∈ Q+ (see 1.2). So it is easier
for us to describe the forms Qε without specifying elements gε .
     In our method, the quadratic forms Qε lying within the same G-orbit lead
to the same estimates; in particular, we can take the diagonal elements gε
described in 0.4. Computationally, however, it is easier to work with another
system of quadratic
            √        forms, namely with the forms Qε (x, y) = a(x−iεy)(εx+iy),
where i = −1 and a > 0 is a (bounded as ε → 0) normalization constant
which makes det Qε = 1.
                                 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                                 339

     We will see in Appendix C that, modulo the G-action, the forms R ∈
Q+ depend only on one parameter, so the specific choice of the family Qε is
inconsequential.
     We can rewrite formula (0.4.2) as
                                     X
(2.1)                    ||φ2ε ||2 =   |ci |2 ||φi,ε ||2 .

    Proposition. Let (π, G, L) be an irreducible unitary representation of
SL(2, R) and v ∈ L a unit K-fixed vector. Consider gε and vε = π(gε )v as
above. Then

(1) ||vε ||2 ≤ C| ln(ε)| as ε → 0.
(2) There exists c > 0 such that if π ≃ πλ is a representation of the principal
    series, then ||vε ||2 > c exp(( π2 − 6ε)|λ|) for any λ and ε < 0.1.
(3) Fix an isometric G-equivariant embedding ν : L → L2 (X) and set φε =
    ν(vε ) ∈ C ∞ (X). Then supx∈X |φε (x)| ≤ C| ln ε| as ε → 0.

     2.3. Proof of Theorem 0.2. From Proposition 2.2 it follows immediately
that we have:
               sup |φε (x)| ≤ C| ln ε| and ||φε ||2 = ||vε ||2 ≤ C| ln(ε)|.
               x∈X

    Therefore, ||φ2ε ||2 ≤ ||φε ||2 · sup |φε |2 ≤ C| ln(ε)|3 . Hence, formula (2.1)
implies
                           X                      X           π             X
  C| ln(ε)|3 ≥ ||φ2ε ||2 =    |ci |2 ||φi,ε ||2 ≥   |ci |2 e( 2 −6ε)|λi | =   bi e−6ε|λi | .
                             i                    i                        i

Set ε = 1/T and collect the terms with |λi | ≤ T , and the desired bound results.




     3. Invariant norms and estimates of automorphic functions

     In this section we prove the upper bound (3) from Proposition 2.

     3.1. Let (π, G, L) be a unitary representation and ν : L → L2 (X) a con-
tinuous G-equivariant morphism. Then ν maps the subspace of smooth vectors
V = L∞ ⊂ L into C ∞ (X). Given a vector v ∈ V , we would like to describe
an effective method for obtaining a pointwise bound for the function φ = ν(v).
In other words, consider the supremum norm Nsup on V defined in 0.5. We
would like to find bounds for Nsup in terms of π.
     Observe that the L2 -norm of φ is bounded by kνk · kvk, where kνk is the
operator norm. So let us assume that ||ν|| ≤ 1.
340                 JOSEPH BERNSTEIN AND ANDRE REZNIKOV


    First, we will describe some weak bounds of Nsup in terms of Sobolev
norms on V ; these bounds easily follow from the Sobolev restriction lemma.
Then we will improve these bounds using the G-invariance of Nsup .
    For convenience we recall the notion of Sobolev norms.
     3.2. Sobolev norms. Let (π, V ) be a smooth representation of a Lie group
G and || · || be a G-invariant Hermitian norm on V . For every nonnegative
integer k define the Sobolev norm Sk on V as follows. Fix a basis X1 , . . . , Xn
of the Lie algebra g = Lie(G) and define the norm Sk by Sk (v)2 = ||Xα v||2 ,
                                                                   P

where the sum runs over all monomials Xα = Xi1 Xi2 · · · Xil of degree ≤ k.
       Remarks. 1. If we start with an arbitrary norm || · || on V , we get another
system of norms, also called Sobolev norms. If the norm || · || is Hermitian,
then all Sobolev norms are also Hermitian ones.
       Our definition depends on the choice of basis Xi but different choices lead
to equivalent norms.
       2. Since the norm || · || is G-invariant, the representation (π, V ) is contin-
uous with respect to the norm Sk for any k, with continuity constants inde-
pendent of the representation π. Namely, for every g ∈ G we have Sk (π(g)v) ≤
||g||kad Sk (v), where || · ||ad is the norm in the adjoint representation of G.
       3. One can actually define Sobolev norm Ss for every s ∈ R as follows.
The operator ∆ = − Xi2 : V → V is an essentially self-adjoint operator on
                           P

V . We can define the Sobolev norm Ss on V to be Ss (v) = ||(∆ + 1)s/2 v||.
     Example. Let (π, V = Dλ ) be the unitary representation of the principal
series of G = SL(2, R) and || · || the standard invariant Hermitian norm; V can
                      ∞ (S 1 ) and e = e (θ) = e2ikθ , k ∈ Z, is a basis consisting
be identified with Ceven             k     k
of K-finite vectors. For a smooth vector v we define its Fourier coefficients as
ak = hv, ek i.
     It is easy to check that in this realization the Sobolev norm Ss is the norm
induced by the quadratic form Qs (v) = n |an |2 (1+ µ + 2n2 )s (here we started
                                            P

with any basis of g orthonormal with respect to the standard scalar product).
     3.3. Sobolev estimate. Let (π, G, L) be a unitary representation of G =
SL(2, R) and V ⊂ L the subspace of smooth vectors. Suppose that X = Γ\G
is compact. Then any morphism of G-modules ν : V → C ∞ (X) defines the
supremum norm Nsup on V .
    Lemma 3.1. Suppose that ||ν|| ≤ 1 with respect to the L2 -norm. Then
Nsup ≤ CS2 , where the constant C only depends on the geometry of X.
    The proof of the lemma easily follows from the Sobolev restriction lemma.
We will present it in Appendix B together with a similar result for noncocom-
pact lattices.
                           ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                             341

    Remark. In [BR] we showed that the same bound Nsup ≪ Ss holds for any
s > 1/2, which is less trivial since it goes beyond the restriction theorem. For
our present purposes, however, the elementary result of the lemma is enough.

     3.4. Invariant (semi-)norms. The bound which we proved in Lemma 3.1
is rather weak. For example, it gives a bound on Nsup (vε ) which is a power
of ε−1 (even if we use optimal constant s = 1/2; see Remark 3.3). We are
able to significantly improve this bound using the fact that the norm Nsup is
G-invariant.
     Let us state some elementary general result about invariant (semi-)norms.
Let G be an arbitrary group acting on some linear space V .

    Claim. For any seminorm N on V there exists a unique seminorm N G on
V satisfying the following conditions:

(1) N G is G-invariant;
(2) N G ≤ N ;
(3) N G is the maximal seminorm satisfying conditions (1) and (2).
We will prove this claim in Appendix A.
   The passage from N to N G has the following obvious properties:
(1) If N1 ≤ CN2 , then N1G ≤ CN2G ;
(2) If N is G-invariant, then N = N G .

     We apply this general construction to our situation, when the space V
is the smooth part of some unitary representation (π, G, L) of G = SL(2, R).
Consider the Sobolev norm S = S2 on V and construct the corresponding
invariant seminorm S G . If ν : L → L2 (X) is a morphism of representations,
then ν(V ) ⊂ C ∞ (X) and we can define the norm Nsup on V as in 0.5. This
norm is G-invariant and Nsup ≤ CS. Hence, Nsup ≤ CS G ; in particular,
Nsup (vε ) ≤ CS G (vε ).
     The norm S G , however, is defined in terms of the representation π only.
It does not depend on the embedding ν. In particular, we can estimate the
norm S G (vε ) by computations in Dλ . The main result in this direction is the
following proposition which implies inequality (3) in Proposition 2.

     Proposition. Let (π, G, L) be a unitary irreducible representation and
v ∈ L a unit K-fixed vector. For k ≥ 0, consider the Sobolev norm S = Sk on
the space V of smooth vectors in L and denote by S G its invariant part.
     Then there exists a constant C > 0 such that S G (vε ) ≤ C| ln(ε)| as ε → 0.

    We will prove this proposition in Section 5.

                                   4. Noncocompact Γ

      4.1. Cuspidal representations. In order to prove the crucial bound,
|φε | ≤ C| ln ε|, we have used the norm Nsup induced by the supremum norm
on X via the embedding ν and the fact that an appropriate Sobolev norm ma-
jorizes it. From this, the proof of the bound and Theorem 0.2 immediately
follow. We will explain now how to find such a Sobolev norm in the case of a
noncocompact lattice Γ.
      If X is noncompact, it is not clear why a supremum norm exists on the
space of smooth vectors of π. Actually, there is no such norm for a general
automorphic representation since a general automorphic function does not need
to decay at infinity. However, if π is cuspidal, then its smooth vectors decay at
infinity and the supremum norm is well defined. A simple proposition below
(proven in Appendix B) shows that there is an appropriate Sobolev norm which
majors Nsup in this case as in the cocompact case. This suffices to prove the
bound |φε | ≤ C| ln ε|, hence, the analog of Theorem 0.2.
     Proposition. Let (π, G, L) be a unitary representation of the group G =
SL(2, R) and ν : L → L2 (X) a bounded morphism of representations whose
image lies in the cuspidal part of L2 (X). Consider the space V = L∞ of
smooth vectors in L and introduce the norm Nsup on V as in 0.5. Then there
exists a constant C such that Nsup ≤ CS3 , where S3 is the third Sobolev norm
on V .
     4.2. We state now the version of Theorem 0.2 for a noncocompact lattice Γ
(for notations see [B]). Denote by {αj }j=1,... ,k the set of cusps and by Ej (s) the
corresponding Eisenstein series; let {φi } be the basis for the discrete spectrum
(cusp forms and residual eigenfunctions). Let φ be a cusp form and denote, as
before, bi = |hφ2 , φi i|2 exp( π2 |λi |) and bj (t) = |hφ2 , Ej ( 21 + it)i|2 exp( π2 |t|).
      Theorem. There exists a constant C such that
             X         XZ
                 bi +            bj (t)dt ≤ C(ln T )3 as T → ∞.
               |λi |≤T         j    |t|≤T



                   5. Some computations in the model Dλ

     This section is devoted to the proof of Propositions 2 and 3.4. Our proof
is based on explicit computations in the model Dλ of the representation π.
     Since π is a unitary representation with a K-fixed vector, it is either a
representation of the principal series, or a representation of the complementary
series (or the trivial representation). In 5.1 and 5.2 we consider representations
of the principal series. In 5.5 we treat the complementary series.
                           ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                              343

     5.1. Proof of statements (1) and (2) of Proposition 2. What we claim in
(1) and (2) is independent of the realization of πλ . We chose the realization of
πλ in Dλ . By definition, the element gε is chosen so that vε = π(gε )v is given
                   λ−1
by the function Qε 2 , where Qε (x, y) = a(x − iεy)(εx + iy).
    For computations we will use two models of the representation Dλ :
    Circle model. Realization of Dλ as the space of smooth functions on S 1 ,
described in 0.1.
    Line model. In this model, to every vector v ∈ Dλ we assign the function
u on the line given by u(x) = v(x, 1).
    The line model is convenient to describe the action of the Borel subgroup.

    Lemma. (1) π( 10 1b )u(x) = u(x − b).

      Denote by qε the restriction of the quadratic form Qε on the line {(x, 1)};
i.e., qε (x) = a(x − iε)(εx + i) = a(ε(x2 + 1) + ix(1 − ε2 )). Thus, the vector
                                               (λ−1)/2
vε ∈ Dλ correspondsRto the function uε = qε            , and we have to estimate
                    2       2
the integral ||vε || = |uε | dx.
     Let m(X) = |q(x)| and a(x) = arg(q(x)) be the modulus and the argument
of the function q. Then for λ = it we have |uε (x)|2 = m(x)−1 exp(2ta(x)).

      Proof of (1) in Proposition 2. Since t is fixed, the function exp(2ta(x)) is
 uniformly bounded, while the function m(x)−1 is bounded by ε−1 for |x| ≤ ε,
                           −1          −1 −2               −1
Rby |1/x| 2for ε ≤ |x| ≤ ε and by ε x for |x| > ε , which implies that
   |uε (x)| dx ≤ C| ln ε|.

    Proof of (2) in Proposition 2. We can assume that t > 0. Clearly, on the
segment [1, 2] we have, uniform in ε < 0.1, bounds |m(x)| < 3 and a(x) >
π/4 − 3ε. This implies that ||vε ||2 ≥ c exp(π/2 − 6ε).

     Remark. There is another way to compute the norm ||vε ||, based on the
theory of spherical functions. Namely, for every λ ∈ C we consider the spher-
ical function Sλ on G equal to the matrix coefficient of the K-fixed vector
v ∈ Dλ , Sλ (g) = hπ(g)v, vi. This function is well-known: it is determined by
its restriction to the diagonal subgroup and on this subgroup it is essentially
given by the Legendre function. In particular, this function has an analytic
continuation to some domain which contains all diagonal matrices diag(a−1 , a)
with |arg(a)| < π/2.
344                 JOSEPH BERNSTEIN AND ANDRE REZNIKOV


      We can compute the norm ||π(g)v|| using spherical functions as follows.
For g ∈ U we write ||π(g)v||2 = hπ(g)v, π(g)vi = hπ(g′ g)v, vi = Sλ (g′ g), where
g′ = ḡ−1 (see 1.1). In particular, if g = diag(a−1 , a), where a ∈ C such that
||a|| = 1 and |arg(a)| < π/4, then we have ||π(g)v||2 = Sλ (g2 ).

     5.2. Proof of Proposition 3.4. We work with a fixed λ as ε → 0. Denote
the norm SkG on the space Dλ by N . We want to estimate N (vε ).

    Step 1. The vector vε is realized as the function Qλ−1 ε   . Consider this
function in a circle model. We can choose a partition of unit αi on the circle
and replace the function vε with a function αvε , where α is a smooth function
with small support on the circle.
     If α is supported far from the x- and the y-axes, then the family of func-
tions αvε is uniformly bounded with respect to the norm Sk , hence, with respect
to the norm N . The case of a function α supported near the x-axis can be
reduced to the case of the y-axis by the change of coordinates (x 7→ y, y 7→ −x).
     Thus, it suffices to estimate N (αvε ), where α is a smooth function sup-
ported near the y-axis.
    Step 2. Let us pass to the line model of the representation Dλ . Here one
should be a little careful since the standard Sobolev norm S k on the space
F of functions on the line does not agree with the Sobolev norm S k on the
space Dλ . However, on the subspace F′ of functions supported on the segment
[−2, 2] these two norms are comparable, and so on this subspace we will pass
from one of these norms to another without changing notations.

      In the line model our vector αvε is represented by the function uε given by
uε (x) = αaκ (x − iε)κ (εx + i)κ , where κ = (λ − 1)/2. We see that as ε → 0 the
structure of the function uε is mainly determined by the factor (x − iε)κ which
is roughly homogeneous in x. We estimate the norm N (uε ) using the fact that
the norm N itself is homogeneous with respect to dilations. We will do this
using the, standard in harmonic analysis, method of dyadic decomposition.
Let us describe this method informally for λ = 0.
      In this case, the function u = uε on [0, 1] is, more or less, equal to (x −
iε) −1/2 . In other words, uε is just a branch of the function x−1/2 slightly
smoothed at the origin.
      The only a priori estimate of the norm N we know is N ≤ Sk . However,
one can easily see that the value Sk (u) is too big. What we can do is to break
the segment I = [0, 1] into smaller segments I1 = [1/2, 1], I2 = [1/4, 1/2], . . . , Il
(plus some small segment at the origin) and to break our function u into the
sum of functions ui approximately supported on these segments.
      Now let us estimate, separately, the norms N (ui ). The operator π(g)
with a suitable diagonal matrix g moves ui into the function u′i with support
                            ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                                345

on [1, 2]. This transformation does not affect the norm N , since N is invariant,
but it tremendously decreases the Sobolev norm Sk . This yields a much better
estimate: N (ui ) = N (u′i ) ≤ Sk (u′i ).
     To get a better bound, we move the function ui as far to the right as
possible. On the other hand, we cannot move it beyond the point 2 since there
we lose control of the Sobolev norm Sk ; this explains, in particular, why we
have to break the function u into pieces: each piece must be scaled differently.
     Let us formulate a general statement about functions on the line that sums
up the results one can prove using this method.
     5.3. Dyadic decomposition. Let F be the space of smooth functions with
compact support on the line. For every t > 0 consider the dilation operator
ht : F → F, where ht (f )(x) = f (t−1 x).
     Suppose on F we have a homogeneous norm N of degree r; i.e., N (ht f ) =
t−r N (f ). Assume also that for functions supported on the segment [−2, 2] we
have the estimate N (f ) ≤ Sk (f ), where Sk is the kth Sobolev norm.
     To estimate the values N (uε ) for some family of functions uε ∈ F as ε → 0,
we assume that the family uε is “roughly homogeneous.” This means that
uε = τε fε ∈ F, where fε is a family of smooth functions on the line such that
ftε = tκ ht (fε ); i.e., ftε (tx) = tκ fε (x) (we say that this family is homogeneous
of degree κ) and τε ∈ F is a family of truncation multipliers.
     Proposition. Let N be a norm homogeneous of degree r on the space
F = Cc∞ (R). Let uε ∈ F be a family of functions described above. Assume
that:
(1) There exists a constant S = Sf which bounds the Sobolev norm Sk on the
    segments [−2, −1] and [1, 2] for all functions fε with 0 < ε < 1 and also
    bounds the Sobolev norm Sk of the function f1 on the segment [−2, 2];
(2) The truncation family τε is uniformly bounded in Cck [−1, 1]; i.e., all these
    functions are supported on the segment [−1, 1] and for all ε ≤ 1 all their
    derivatives up to order k are bounded by some constant Ctr .
                                      R1
    Then N (uε ) ≤ CCtr Sf (εRe κ−r + ε tRe κ−r · dt/t).
    In other words, N (uε ) ≪ 1 if Re κ > r, N (uε ) ≪ εRe κ−r if Re κ < r and
N (uε ) ≪ | ln ε| if Re κ = r.
     We can apply this proposition to our situation. Namely, consider the
family of functions fε (x) = (x + iε)κ , where κ = (λ − 1)/2. Identify the space
F = Cc∞ (R) with a subspace in Dλ using the line model of Dλ (see 5.1). Then
the formulas for the action of the diagonal group on F from Lemma 5.1 show
that the G-invariant norm N on Dλ considered as a norm on F is homogeneous
of degree r = −1/2.
346                     JOSEPH BERNSTEIN AND ANDRE REZNIKOV


     It is easy to check that the family of functions uε (for some τε ) satisfies
the conditions of Proposition 5.3 with κ = (λ − 1)/2. Thus, Re κ = −1/2 and
Proposition 5.3 shows that N (uε ) ≤ C| ln ε|, which proves Proposition 3.4.
     5.4. Proof of Proposition 5.3. Let us formalize the proof outlined in 5.2.
Technically, it is a little easier to break u into an integral, rather than a sum,
of components. That is what we are going to do.
     Fix a smooth function γ ∈ F equal to 1 on [−1, 1] and supported on
[−2, 2]. Then γuε = uε .
                                                                        d
     Consider two families of functions in F: γt = ht (γ) and δt = t dt   γt .
     They have the following properties:
 (i) γ1 is supported on [−2, 2]; δ1 is supported on [−2, −1] ∪ [1, 2];
 (ii) ht (γ1 ) = γt , ht (δ1 ) = δt ;
                  R1
(iii) γ1 − γa = a δt · dt/t.
     Fix an ε ≤ 1 and consider two families of functions
                                                      R 1 in F: gt = γt uε and
ct = δt uε . Then we can express uε = g1 as g1 = gε + ε ct · dt/t. Hence, the
following claim (with Ctr , Sf described in the statement of Proposition 5.3)
implies the bound on the norm N (uε ):
      Claim. There exists C which only depends on k and such that
(1) N (ct ) ≤ CCtr Sf tRe κ−r for all t such that ε ≤ t ≤ 1;
(2) N (gε ) ≤ CCtr Sf εRe κ−r .
      Proof. (1) Set a = t−1 . Then we have N (ct ) = t−r N (ha (ct )) and ha (ct ) =
ha (δt )ha (τε )ha (fε ) = δ1 ha (τε )faε · tκ . Observe that the function ha (ct ) is sup-
ported on [−2, −1] ∪ [1, 2], where all the derivatives of δ1 ha (τε ) up to the order
k are uniformly bounded by CCtr , while the Sk -norm of all functions faε is
bounded by Sf . This implies that N (ha (ct )) ≤ Sk (ha (ct )) ≤ CCtr Sf tRe κ .
Hence, N (ct ) ≤ CCtr Sf tRe κ−r .
      Claim (2) is similarly proved with the help of the dilation h−1      ε .

     5.5. The complementary series. We describe modifications in the proofs
in 5.1 and 5.2 needed to treat the complementary series.
     Let (π, G, V ) be a representation of the complementary series. We will
realize it as a representation (πλ , Dλ ) for some λ such that −1 < λ < 0 (see
formulas in [G5]).
     We can use the line model     of the space Dλ as in 5.1 but with the scalar
product given by ||f ||2 = |x − x′ |−λ−1 f (x)f (x′ )dxdx′ . As in 5.1, we have
                              R

to estimate ||uε ||2 , where uε = (qε )(λ−1)/2 . In this case the main contribution
comes from a neighborhood of 0 and direct computations show that ||uε ||2 ≤
C| ln ε|.
                             ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                                 347

     Proof in 5.2 is even easier. Indeed, the invariant norm N on Dλ becomes
a homogeneous of degree (λ − 1)/2 norm N on the space F of functions on
the line. We have to estimate the value of this norm on a function uε , roughly
homogeneous of degree κ = (λ − 1)/2. Proposition 5.3 implies that N (uε ) ≤
C| ln ε|.

                         Appendix A. Invariant norms

     A.1. Fix a complex vector space V . A seminorm on V is a function
N : V → R+ such that N (v1 + v2 ) ≤ N (v1 ) + N (v2 ) and N (av) = |a|N (v).
     The set N of all seminorms on V is a partially ordered set with respect
to the relation ≤, where N ≤ N ′ whenever N (v) ≤ N ′ (v) for all v ∈ V .

     Lemma. The partially ordered set (N , ≤) is inductive, i.e., any nonempty
family of seminorms Nu has the exact lower bound N = inf Nu .
                                                    P
     Proof. Define N by setting N (v) = inf( Nui (vi )), where the sum runs
over all finite collections v1 , . . . , vk ∈ V and Nu1 , . . . , Nuk ∈ N which satisfy
P
   vi = v.
     It is easy to check that N is a seminorm bounded by each seminorm Nu .
If M is a seminorm such that M ≤ Nu for all Nu , then, clearly, M ≤ N . The
uniqueness of N is obvious.

    Geometrically it is clear that the seminorm N is defined by the unit ball
which is the convex hull of the unit balls of the seminorms Nu .

    A.2. Construction of invariant seminorms. Suppose an arbitrary group
G acts on a complex vector space V . Then G acts on the set of seminorms
on V by g(N )(v) = N (g−1 v). For every seminorm N on V we define a new
seminorm: N G = inf g(N ). From the definition one can immediately deduce
                   g∈G
that:

 (i) N G is an invariant seminorm.
(ii) If M is any invariant seminorm bounded by N , then M ≤ N G .

     Remark. Let us apply this construction to a representation (π, G, V ) of
the unitary principal series of the group G = SL(2, R).
     For any s ∈ R, consider the corresponding Sobolev norm Ss and construct
the invariant seminorm SsG . One can easily show that for s < 0 the seminorm
SsG vanishes. For s ≥ 0 the norm Ss is bounded below by an invariant unitary
norm || · ||. This implies that || · || ≤ SsG ; hence, SsG is a norm.
     One can show that for all s > 1/2 the norms SsG are equivalent to the
same norm, B. This norm is distinguished by the condition that it is the
maximal G-invariant norm on V (i.e., any G-invariant norm N is bounded by
348                JOSEPH BERNSTEIN AND ANDRE REZNIKOV


CB for some constant C). If we realize V as the space of functions on the
                                                                   1/2
circle (see 0.1), then B becomes equivalent to the Besov norm B1,1 (here 1/2
stands for derivative of order 1/2, one 1 stands for the L1 -norm and another
1 is the weight index in the Besov norm). This equivalence can be shown by
standard methods of harmonic analysis, like in [A], where similar questions are
discussed.
     In particular, this shows that for any cuspidal representation we have a
bound on the supremum norm of the form Nsup ≪ B.
     For 0 ≤ s ≤ 1/2 the norms SsG are all distinct. It is interesting to inves-
tigate the nature of these norms. We think that in the circle model they are
close to Besov norms, namely SsG ∼ Bq,q s with 1/q − s = 1/2.

     The embedding ν : V → C ∞ (X) defines a family of G-invariant norms Np
on the space V corresponding to Lp -norms on X. We can use Proposition 4.1
and the Besov norm B described above to give some bounds for these norms
in terms of the representation (π, G, V ) only.
     Namely, consider a representation of the principal series. Realize the space
V in the circle model. Then we have the required bounds at two points:

 (i) N2 coincides with the L2 -norm on S 1 , the latter being the Besov norm
      0 .
     B2,2
                                           1/2
(ii) N∞ is bounded by the norm B = B1,1 .

    Using interpolation theory for Banach norms we conclude that for inter-
mediate p, 2 ≤ p ≤ ∞, there exists a bound Np ≪ Bq,q s , where 1/q + 1/p = 1,

1/q − s = 1/2.
    It is interesting to give similar bounds for norms Np for 1 ≤ p < 2.

              Appendix B. Estimates using Sobolev norms

      B.1. Sobolev inequalities. We start with the standard Sobolev lemma:

     Lemma. Let B be the unit ball in Rn . Consider the space V of smooth
functions on B with the L2 -norm || · ||, and introduce Sobolev norms Sk on V
as in subsection 3.2, i.e., Sk (f )2 =   ||∂α (f )||2 , where the sum runs over all
                                       P

monomials in partial derivatives ∂α = ∂i1 , . . . , ∂il of order ≤ k. Then for any
k > n/2 there exists a constant C such that |f (0)| ≤ CSk (f ) for f ∈ V .

     This lemma holds (though its formulation is more cumbersome) for any
Sobolev norm Ss with s > n/2.
     In this paper we actually need this lemma only for k ≥ n. In this case the
estimate is elementary and can be proven by induction using direct integration.
     From the Sobolev lemma we immediately deduce its version for any Lie
group G. Namely, suppose G is an n-dimensional Lie group. We fix some
                           ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                            349

basis Xi of the Lie algebra g of the group G and use it to construct a left-
invariant metric and a left-invariant measure on G. Fix a symmetric compact
neighborhood B of the unit e ∈ G; we will call B the unit ball.
     Consider the space V of smooth functions on B, introduce the L2 -norm
with respect to the left-invariant measure on G and define Sobolev norms on
V using derivatives Xi ∈ g corresponding to the right G-action.
      Corollary. Let k > n/2. Then there exists a constant C such that
|f (e)| ≤ CSk (f ), for any f ∈ V .
     Though this reformulation seems to be quite trivial, it is in fact rather
strong, since it gives some estimates which are uniform with respect to the left
G-action.
      B.2. Sobolev inequalities for homogeneous spaces. Let X = Γ\G be a
homogeneous space. We consider a measure on X induced by a left G-invariant
Haar measure on G and introduce the L2 -norm and Sobolev norms in the
space V of smooth functions on X. We would like to describe Sobolev type
inequalities which are uniform on X.
      We will call a function w on the space X a weight if it is a positive
measurable function and for every g ∈ G there exists a constant C(g) such
that w(xg) ≤ C(g)w(x) for all x ∈ X; we also assume that the function C(g)
is locally bounded.
      Fix a ball B ⊂ G as above. For every point x ∈ X we consider the
map px : B → X given by g 7→ xg. This map induces the morphism of Hilbert
spaces p∗x : L2 (X) → L2 (B) and we denote by w(x) the norm of this morphism.
(One can show that w(x)2 is the maximal cardinality of the fibers of the map
px .) It is easy to see that w is a weight on X. It depends on the choice of the
unit ball B but for different balls these functions are comparable.
      Now the Sobolev inequality for G (Corollary B.1) immediately implies
    Proposition. For k > n/2 there exists a constant C such that for any
f ∈ V and x ∈ X, |f (x)| ≤ Cw(x)Sk (f ).
    If X is compact, then the weight function w(x) is bounded; thus the
proposition implies Lemma 3.3.
    If X is not compact, then in order to get a bound on sup |f (x)| we need
an additional information, e.g., that f is cuspidal.
     B.3. Sobolev estimates in the cuspidal case. Let G be a Lie group, Γ ⊂ G
a lattice in G and X = Γ\G. We fix a basis in g = Lie(G) and use it to
construct a left-invariant metric on G and the induced metric on X.
     Recall the notion of the cuspidal function on X. A unipotent subgroup
U ⊂ G is cuspidal if U is nontrivial and ΓU = Γ ∩ U is a cocompact subgroup
350                JOSEPH BERNSTEIN AND ANDRE REZNIKOV


in U . Geometrically this means that the left orbits of U in G become compact
when mapped to X; these compact sets are called horocycles.
     A smooth function f on X is called cuspidal if the integral of f over any
horocycle vanishes. Important here is the G-invariance of the space of cuspidal
functions on X; in particular, this space is g-invariant.
     For every point x ∈ X, define d(x) as the infimum of 1 and the diameters
of all horocycles through x. Roughly speaking, d measures how close point x
is to a cusp.
     The following lemma shows that we can improve estimates for a cuspidal
function if we know estimates for its derivatives.

      Lemma. Suppose f is a smooth cuspidal function on X such that f and
all its derivatives Xi f are bounded by a weight w. Then for some constant C
independent of f , the function f is bounded by a weight w′ = Cwd.

     Proof. Let x ∈ X. If d(x) ≥ 0.1, there is nothing to prove. So suppose
d(x) < 0.1; i.e., there exists an horocycle H passing through x and diam(H) ≤
2d(x) < 0.2. By hypothesis, all the derivatives of f at all points of H are
bounded by Cw(x). This means that the gradient of f is bounded by C ′ w(x)
at all points of H.
     We can assume that the function f is real. Then the condition that its
integral over H vanishes implies that f vanishes at least at one of the points
of H. Combined with the estimate |grad(f )| ≤ C ′ w(x) and the fact that
diam(H) ≤ 2d(x) this implies the desired estimate |f (x)| ≤ 2C ′ w(x)d(x).

     Proof of Proposition 4.1. Let us come back to the case G = SL(2, R),
X = Γ\G.
     Let f be a cuspidal function on X. It follows from the estimate in B.2 that
f and its derivatives are bounded by Cw(x)S3 (f ) with the weight w introduced
in B.2. Hence, |f | ≤ Cw(x)d(x)S3 (f ) by Lemma B.3. In order to finish the
proof, it suffices to show that the function wd is bounded on X. This result
easily follows from the theory of Siegel domains. Let us recall this theory.
     Fix a cuspidal unipotent subgroup U , set ΓU = Γ ∩ U and consider the
homogeneous space XU = ΓU \G. Let p : XU → X be the natural projection.
     Let A be the Cartan group of G. It is canonically isomorphic to R∗ ; we
define the function h : A → R by h(a) = ln(|a|). Using Iwasawa decomposition
we can canonically extend h to a left U -invariant and right K-invariant function
on G. This latter function defines the function h : XU → R.
     A Siegel domain ST is an open subdomain of XU defined as the preimage
  −1
h (T, ∞). Fix one Siegel domain S = ST and consider the map p : S → X.
It is easy to see that for the unit ball B ⊂ G the domain S′ = S · B is
contained in another Siegel domain, ST ′ . By the theory of Siegel domains the
                            ANALYTIC CONTINUATION                                351

cardinality of the fibers of the map p : S′ → X is finite and bounded; hence,
the operator p∗ : L2 (X) → L2 (S′ ) is bounded. By the definition of w this
implies that w(p(x)) ≤ Cw(x) for any x ∈ S. Also, obviously, d(p(x)) ≤ d(x)
for any x ∈ S.
     By reduction theory the space X can be covered by a compact set and
the union of images of a finite collection of Siegel domains. Hence, in order to
check that the function dw is bounded on X, it suffices to check the bound on
each Siegel domain.
     Direct computations on the Siegel domain ST show that for x ∈ ST ⊂ XU
we have d(x) ≤ C exp(−h(x)) and w(x) ≤ C exp(h(x)/2), which shows that
the function dw is bounded on ST .

          Appendix C. The geometry of domain U ⊂ SL(2, C)

       In the 2-dimensional case there is a convenient way to describe the variety
Q of unimodular quadratic forms; see 1.2. Namely, fix a skew-symmetric form
h·, ·i on C2 . Then for any pair of noncollinear vectors a, b ∈ C2 set Qa,b (x) =
ha,xihb,xi                                                                         1
   ha,bi . Note that this form only depends on the images of a and b in P ,
i.e., we can define the unimodular quadratic form Qa,b for any pair of distinct
points of P1 . It is easy to see that this identification defines a natural SL(2, C)-
equivariant isomorphism of algebraic varieties P1 × P1 \ {diagonal} and Q.

      Lemma. (1) Identify C with an open subset of P1 , z 7→ (z, 1). (In partic-
ular, this realizes H as an open G-invariant subset of P1 .) Then the morphism
(a, b) 7→ Qa,b identifies the domain H × H̄ with the subdomain Q+ ⊂ Q.
    (2) Let I(Q) = {diag(z −1 , z) : | arg z| < π4 } ⊂ GC . Then U = SL(2, R) · I ·
SO(2, C).

     Proof. If P is a diagonal unimodular quadratic form on C2 , then it is easy
to see that P ∈ Q+ if and only if P is of the form g(Q) for some g ∈ I. This
shows that I ⊂ U and, hence, G · I · KC ⊂ U .
     In order to prove the opposite inclusion it suffices to show that Q+ =
G · I(Q). Consider any form P ∈ Q+ . Since the form Re P is positive definite,
we can find a basis of R2 in which the real and imaginary parts of P are simul-
taneously diagonalized. This implies that the orbit G(P ) contains a diagonal
quadratic form P ′ . As we saw, P ′ is of the form h(Q) for some h ∈ I. This
proves heading (2).
     The form Q corresponds to the point (i, −i) ∈ H × H̄. Hence, for h ∈ I
the point (hi, −hi) ∈ H × H̄ corresponds to the quadratic form h(Q) which lies
in Q+ ; thus, the subset I(Q) lies in both H × H̄ and Q+ .
     Since Q+ and H × H̄ are G-invariant, to show that they coincide, it suffices
to show that each of them is generated by I(Q) under the G-action.

     For Q+ this fact was already proven in heading (2). In order to prove it
for H × H̄, observe that the only G-invariant of the pair (a, b) ∈ H × H̄ is the
hyperbolic distance d(a, b̄). Since, in I(Q), arbitrary distances can be realized,
I(Q) generates H × H̄ as a G-set.
