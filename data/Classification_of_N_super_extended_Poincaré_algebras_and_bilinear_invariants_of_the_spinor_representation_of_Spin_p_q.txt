                                                    Abstract. We classify extended Poincaré Lie super algebras and Lie algebras of
                                                    any signature (p, q), that is Lie super algebras and Z2 -graded Lie algebras g =
                                                    g0 + g1 , where g0 = so(V ) + V is the (generalized) Poincaré Lie algebra of the
                                                    pseudo Euclidean vector space V = Rp,q of signature (p, q) and g1 = S is the
                                                    spinor so(V )-module extended to a g0 -module with kernel V . The remaining super
                                                    commutators {g1 , g1 } (respectively, commutators [g1 , g1 ]) are defined by an so(V )-
                                                    equivariant linear mapping
                                                                 ∨2 g1 → V    (respectively,   ∧2 g1 → V ) .
                                                    Denote by P + (n, s) (respectively, P − (n, s)) the vector space of all such Lie super
                                                    algebras (respectively, Lie algebras), where n = p + q = dim V and s = p − q is
                                                    the signature. The description of P ± (n, s) reduces to the construction of all so(V )-
                                                    invariant bilinear forms on S and to the calculation of three Z2 -valued invariants
                                                    for some of them.
                                                       This calculation is based on a simple explicit model of an irreducible Clifford
                                                    module S for the Clifford algebra Clp,q of arbitrary signature (p, q). As a result of
                                                    the classification, we obtain the numbers L± (n, s) = dim P ± (n, s) of independent
                                                    Lie super algebras and algebras, which take values 0,1,2,3,4 or 6. Due to Bott
                                                    periodicity, L± (n, s) may be considered as periodic functions with period 8 in each
                                                    argument. They are invariant under the group Γ generated by the four reflections
                                                    with respect to the axes n = −2, n = 2, s − 1 = −2 and s − 1 = 2. Moreover, the
                                                    reflection (n, s) → (−n, s) with respect to the axis n = 0 interchanges L+ and L− :
                                                                          L+ (−n, s) = L− (n, s) .

   The Lie super algebra of this super group for N = 1 is defined as follows: p(1) (1, 3) =
g = g0 + g1 = p(1, 3) + S, where p(1, 3) = R1,3 + so(1, 3) is the Poincaré Lie algebra
and S = C2 is the spinor module of the Lorentz algebra so(1, 3) ∼     = sl(2, C) trivially
extended to a p(1, 3)-module. The supercommutator {·, ·} : S ⊗ S → R1,3 is defined
as projection onto the unique vector submodule V ∼     = R1,3 in the symmetric square
  2
∨ S.
   We remark that in this case there exists also a unique vector submodule in ∧2 S,
which defines on p(1, 3) + S the structure of a Z2 -graded Lie algebra p(−1) (1, 3).
   Our goal is to classify for any pseudo Euclidean space V = Rp,q all similar exten-
sions of the (generalized) Poincaré algebra p(V ) = p(p, q) = Rp,q + so(p, q) to a super
Lie algebra or to a Z2 -graded Lie algebra.
   An other motivation to study such extensions is that extended Poincaré Lie alge-
bras are closely related to the full isometry algebra isom(M) of homogeneous quater-
nionic Kähler manifolds M (s. [dW-V-VP], [A-C1]). In fact, isom(M) = p + RA,
where p is an extension of the Poincaré algebra p(3, 3 + k) of the pseudo Euclidean
space R3,3+k of signature (3, 3 + k), k = −1, 0, 1, . . . , and A is a derivation of p
defining a natural gradation.

Definition 0.1. A super Lie algebra (respectively a Z2 -graded Lie algebra) g = g0 +g1
is called an N-extended (respectively −N-extended) Poincaré algebra of V =
Rp,q if the following conditions hold
  1) g0 ∼= p(V ).
  2) g1 is a sum of N irreducible spinor or semi spinor modules of p(V ) = V + so(V )
      with trivial action of the vector group V.
  3) The super bracket {S, S} ⊂ V (respectively Lie bracket [S, S] ⊂ V ).

   Let S be a p(V )-module with trivial action of the vector group V . Then defining
on g = p(V ) + S the structure of a super Lie algebra (respectively of a Z2 -graded
Lie algebra) such that g0 ∼= p(V ), g1 = S and {S, S} ⊂ V (respectively [S, S] ⊂ V )
is equivalent to defining an so(V )-equivariant mapping j : V ∗ → ∨2 S ∗ (respectively
j : V ∗ → ∧2 S ∗ ). The super bracket (respectively the Lie bracket) is given by j ∗ :
∨2 S → V (respectively j ∗ : ∧2 S → V ). Remark that under these assumptions the
Jacobi identities are automatically satisfied.
   We show that the classification of N-extended (N ∈ Z) Poincaré algebras easily
reduces to the classification of equivariant embeddings V ∗ ֒→ ∨2 S ∗ if N > 0 and
V ∗ ֒→ ∧2 S ∗ if N < 0, where V is the vector module and S the spinor module of
so(V ). In other words, we reduce the classification to the cases N = ±1, ±2.
   We prove that the following three vector spaces are isomorphic:
    1) the space J of so(V )-equivariant mappings j : V ∗ → S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ ,
    2) the space M of so(V )-equivariant multiplications µ : V ∗ ⊗ S → S and
    3) the space B of so(V )-invariant bilinear forms β on S.

   Let ρ : V ∗ ⊗ S → S be the (standard) Clifford multiplication, where we have
identified V ∼= V ∗ using the scalar product on V = Rp,q . Then an isomorphism
jρ : B → J is given by
                jρ (β) : v ∗ ∈ V ∗ 7→ β ◦ ρ(v ∗ ) = β(ρ(v ∗ )·, ·) ∈ S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ .
   In particular, the classification of so(V )-equivariant mappings V ∗ → S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ is
equivalent to the classification of so(V )-invariant bilinear forms on the spinor module
S. The latter amounts to the description of the Schur algebra C of so(V )-invariant
endomorphisms of S. The structure of C as abstract algebra depends only on the
signature s = p − q of Rp,q modulo 8; it is a simple real, complex or quaternionic
matrix algebra of rank 1 or 2 or a sum of two isomorphic such algebras.
   To construct equivariant embeddings of the vector module V ∗ into the symmetric
square ∨2 S ∗ (or into the exterior square ∧2 S ∗ ) we introduce the notion of admissible
bilinear form β on S and also the corresponding notion of admissible endomorphism
of S, which depends on the choice of an admissible bilinear form β.
Definition 0.2. An so(V )-invariant bilinear form β on the spinor module S is called
admissible if it has the following properties:
  1) Clifford multiplication ρ(v) is either β-symmetric or β-skew symmetric. We
     define the type τ of β to be τ (β) = +1 in the first case and τ (β) = −1 in the
     second.
  2) β is symmetric or skew symmetric. Accordingly, we define the symmetry σ of β
     to be σ(β) = ±1.
  3) If the spinor module is reducible, S = S + + S − , then S ± are either mutually
     orthogonal or isotropic. We put ι(β) = +1 in the first case, ι(β) = −1 in the
     second and call ι(β) the isotropy of β.
   Every admissible form β defines an so(V )-equivariant embedding jρ (β) : V ∗ →
∨ S ∗ if τ (β)σ(β) = +1 or jρ (β) : V ∗ → ∧2 S ∗ if τ (β)σ(β) = −1. Moreover, if
 2

S = S + + S − , then either S ± are orthogonal or isotropic for every bilinear form in
the image of jρ (β).
   The main part of the paper is the construction of an admissible basis for the space
J of equivariant mappings V ∗ → S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ , i.e. a basis consisting of embeddings jρ (β),
where β are admissible bilinear forms on S.
   To describe all admissible forms β we make use of very simple explicit models
of the irreducible Clifford modules inspired by Ras̆evskiı̆ [R]. We prove that the
problem reduces to the three fundamental cases V = Rm,m , Rk,0 and R0,k using the
isomorphisms Cℓm+k,m ∼           ˆ k and Cℓm,m+k ∼
                        = Cℓm,m ⊗Cℓ                             ˆ 0,k and the algebraic
                                                      = Cℓm,m ⊗Cℓ
properties of the fundamental invariants τ , σ and ι with respect to Z2 -graded tensor
products.
   Moreover, we establish that for every pseudo Euclidean vector space V = Rp,q there
is a prefered non degenerate so(V )-invariant bilinear form h on the spinor module

S. This allows us to define canonically the notion of admissible endomorphism of S
and the invariants τ , σ and ι for such endomorphisms. They are multiplicative with
respect to the composition h ◦ A = h(A·, ·), A ∈ C admissible.
   Finally, we explicitly construct in all the cases an admissible basis for the Schur
algebra C. This canonically yields admissible bases for the space B of invariant
bilinear forms and the space J of equivariant mappings.
   This gives an explicit description of all extended Poincaré algebras g = p(V ) + S,
where S is the spinor module. The super (respectively Lie) brackets ∨2 S → V
(respectively ∧2 S → V ) are given as linear combinations of mappings ji∗ , where the
ji : V ∗ → ∨2 S ∗ (respectively V ∗ → ∧2 S ∗ ) form an admissible basis for the space of
so(V )-equivariant mappings V ∗ → ∨2 S ∗ (respectively V ∗ → ∧2 S ∗ ).
   If the spinor module S is an irreducible so(V )-module, we obtain all N = ±1
extended Poincaré algebras. If S is reducible, then we obtain all N = ±2 extended
Poincaré algebras and using the invariant ι we can determine all N = ±1 extended
Poincaré algebras. Sometimes there exist only trivial N = 1 (or N = −1) extended
Poincaré algebras, i.e. {S, S} = 0 (or [S, S] = 0).
   Given a pseudo Euclidean vector space V = Rp,q , let |N| = 1 or 2 denote the
number of irreducible summands of the spinor module S of so(V ). For fixed N =
+|N| or N = −|N| we give now the dimension dN of the vector space of N-extended
Poincaré algebra structures on g = p(V ) + S.
   The function dN , which depends only on the signature (p, q), admits a symmetry
group Γ generated by reflections. Moreover, there is an additional supersymmetry
which relates the dimension L+ := d+|N | of the space of super algebras to the dimen-
sion L− := d−|N | of the space of Lie algebras.
   More precisely: Denote by n = p + q the dimension and by s = p − q the signature
of V = Rp,q and let L+ = L+ (n, s) (respectively L− (n, s)) be the maximal number
of linearly independent super algebra structures ∨2 S → V (respectively Lie algebra
structures ∧2 S → V ) on g = p(V ) + S. The functions L+ and L− are periodic with
period 8 in each argument, hence we may consider them as functions on Z2 = Z × Z.
The value of the pair (L+ , L− ) is given in Table 1. It follows from the inspection of
this table, that the function (L+ , L− ) is invariant under the group Γ generated by
the reflections with respect to the 4 axes defined by the equations n = −2, n = 2,
s′ := s − 1 = −2 and s′ = s − 1 = 2. A fundamental domain F for Γ is
            F = {(n, s) ∈ Z2 | − 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ,   −2 ≤ s′ = s − 1 ≤ 2} ∩ G ,

    G = {(n, s)|∃(p, q) ∈ Z2 : n = p + q,   s = p − q} = {(n, s) ∈ Z2 |n + s even}
and consists of 12 points. The values of the pair (L+ , L− ) at these points are typed
in bold face in Table 1.
   Moreover, the reflection θ with respect to the axis {n = 0}, θ : (n, s) 7→ (−n, s),
is a supersymmetry of the pair (L+ , L− ), that is it interchanges the number of Lie

         g = p(V ) + S are given as functions of the dimension n and signature s
         of V . A fundamental domain for the reflection group Γ is emphasized
         in bold face. The supersymmetry axis is given by the equation n = 0.

space with the metric < x, y > = i=1 xi y i − p+q          j j
                                                   j=p+1 x y . We denote by so(V ) =
so(p, q) the pseudo orthogonal Lie algebra and by p(V ) = p(p, q) = so(V ) + V the
semidirect sum of so(V ) and the Abelian ideal V , it is the Lie algebra of the isometry
group of (V, < ·, · >). We call p(V ) the Poincaré algebra of the space V .
Definition 1.1. A Z2 -graded Lie algebra (respectively a super algebra) g = g0 + g1
is called an extension (respectively a super extension) of p(V ) if g0 = p(V ),
V is in the kernel of the representation of g0 on g1 and [g1 , g1 ] ⊂ V (respectively
{g1 , g1 } ⊂ V ).

  Remark 1: Sometimes, for unification, we will refer to Z2 -graded Lie algebras and
to super algebras as ǫ-algebras, where ǫ = −1 or +1 respectively. Correspondingly,
we will speak of ǫ-extensions.
Proposition 1.1. There exists a natural one-to-one correspondence between exten-
sions (respectively super extensions) of p(V ) up to isomorphisms and equivalence
classes of pairs (ρ, π), where
                                   ρ : so(V ) → gl(W )
is a representation and
                          π : ∧2 W → V       (resp.   ∨2 W → V )
is a so(V )-equivariant linear map from the space of skew symmetric (respectively
symmetric) bilinear forms on W ∗ to the vector module V . Two pairs (ρ, π) and
(ρ′ , π ′ ) (ρ′ : so(V ) → gl(W ′)) are equivalent if there exists an automorphism φ :
p(V ) → p(V ) and a linear map ψ : W → W ′ such that the following diagramms are
commutative (for pairs of skew symmetric type):
                              ρ                                    π
                    so(V ) −→ gl(V )                  ∧2 W         −→ V
                      ↓ φ̄      ↓            ψ         ↓         ψ    ↓   φ|V
                              ρ′         ′             2     ′     π′
                    so(V ) −→ gl(W )                  ∧W          −→ V
where φ̄ is the induced automorphism of so(V ) = p(V )/V . For pairs of symmetric
type ∧2 must be replaced by ∨2 .
  Proof: Given a pair (ρ, π) of skew symmetric type, we define a Z2 -graded Lie
algebra g = g0 + g1 , g0 = p(V ) = so(V ) + V , g1 = W by
                                [A, w] = ρ(A)w ,
                              [w1 , w2 ] = π(w1 ∧ w2 ) ,
                                 [v, w] = 0 ,
where A ∈ so(V ), v ∈ V and w, w1, w2 ∈ W . For a pair of symmetric type we define
a super algebra g = g0 + g1 by the same formulas replacing only the middle equation
by
                              {w1 , w2 } = π(w1 ∨ w2 ) .
The Jacobi identity is satisfied because ρ is a representation, π is equivariant and
the (anti)commutator of W with W is contained in V and hence commutes with W .
The other statements can be checked easily.
  Recall that the spinor representation is the representation of so(V ) on an irre-
ducible module S of the Clifford algebra Cℓ(V ). It is either irreducible or a sum of
two irreducible semi spinor modules S ± .

Definition 1.2. (cf. Def. 0.1) Let g = g(ρ, π) be an ǫ-extension of p(V ) associated
with a pair (ρ, π). We say that g is an ǫN-extended Poincaré algebra if ρ is a
sum of N = 0, 1, 2, . . . irreducible spin 1/2 representations, i.e. irreducible spinor or
semi spinor representations.
  The purpose of this paper is to classify all N-extended (N ∈ Z) Poincaré algebras.
Before starting this classification we explain how, given a (super) extension of the
Poincaré algebra, we can construct more complicated ǫ-algebras.
1.2. Internal symmetries and charges.
Definition 1.3. Let g = g0 + g1 be an ǫ-algebra. An internal symmetry of g is
an automorphism of g which acts trivially on g0 .
   Now we give a simple construction which associates with an ǫ-extension g = g(ρ, π)
of the Poincaré algebra p(V ) and l ∈ N an ǫ-extension g(+l) and also a −ǫ-extension
g(−2l) which admit O(l) respectively Sp(2l, R) as internal symmetry groups. We define
g(+l) = g(ρ(+l) , π (+l) ), where
                         ρ(+l) = lρ : so(V ) → lW = W ⊗ Rl ,

                    π (+l) (w1 ⊗ v1 , w2 ⊗ v2 ) = π(w1 , w2 )< v1 , v2 > ,
< ·, · > is the standard Euclidean scalar product on Rl . Similarly, we define
                       g(−2l) = 2lρ : so(V ) → 2lW = W ⊗ R2l ,

                    π (−2l) (w1 ⊗ v1 , w2 ⊗ v2 ) = π(w1 , w2 )ω(v1 , v2 ) ,
where ω is the standard symplectic form on R2l . Here we have used the convention
that π(w1 , w2 ) = π(w1 ∨ w2 ) if ǫ = +1 and π(w1 , w2 ) = π(w1 ∧ w2 ) if ǫ = −1.
Proposition 1.2. If g is an ǫ-extension of the Poincaré algebra p(V ), then g(+l) is
an ǫ-extension and g(−2l) is a −ǫ-extension. The standard actions of O(l) (respec-
tively Sp(2l, R)) on Rl (respectively R2l ) are naturally extended to actions on g(+l)
(respectively g(−2l) ) by internal symmetries.
  Proof: The first statement follows immediately from Prop. 1.1 and the remark that
the bilinear map π (+l) (respectively π (−2l) ) has the same (respectively the opposite)
symmetry as π. The last statement is immediate.
Example 1: Applying this construction to an ǫ-extended (s. Def. 1.2) Poincaré alge-
bra, we obtain an ǫl-extended Poincaré algebra and also an −ǫ2l-extended Poincaré
algebra with internal symmetry groups O(l) and Sp(2l, R) respectively.
Definition 1.4. A Z2 -graded Lie algebra (respectively a super algebra) g = g0 + g1
is called a charged extension (respectively a charged super extension) of the
Poincaré algebra p(V ) if
       N -(SUPER)-EXTENDED POINCARÉ ALGEBRAS AND BILINEAR INVARIANTS                9

   1) g0 = p(V ) + C is a trivial extension of p(V ), i.e. [C, C] = 0.
   2) The action of V + C on the g0 -module W = g1 is trivial.
   3) The Lie (respectively super) bracket π : ∧2 W → g0 (respectively ∨2 W → g0 ) is
      a sum π = πV + πC , where πV : ∧2 W → V and πC : ∧2 W → C (respectively
      πV : ∨2 W → V and πC : ∨2 W → C). In particular, (p(V ) + W, πV ) is an
      extension (respectively super extension) of p(V ).
If moreover, [so(V ), C] = 0, and hence [C, g] = 0, then g is called a central charge
extension (respectively a central charge super extension) of p(V ).
   Let an extension (respectively super extension) p(V ) + W admitting a connected
Lie group H of internal symmetries be given. Without restriction of generality we
can assume that H is simply connected and we denote the Lie algebra of H by h.
To construct a charged extension (respectively super extension) (p(V ) + C) + W
preserving the internal symmetry group H it is necessary and sufficient to define an
(so(V ) + h)-equivariant map πC from the exterior (respectively symmetric) square of
W to an (so(V ) + h)-module C.
Example 2: Let p(V ) + W be an extension of p(V ). Consider the extension g(+l) =
p(V ) + W ⊗ Rl with internal symmetry group H = O(l) defined above. Let h ∈
∨2 W ∗ ⊗ Rr be a symmetric so(V )-invariant (possibly trivial) vector valued bilinear
form on W and η ∈ ∧2 W ∗ ⊗ Rs a skew symmetric such form. Define
                 πC : ∧2 (W ⊗ Rl ) → C = Rr ⊗ ∧2 Rl + Rs ⊗ ∨2 Rl ,

            πC (w1 ⊗ x1 , w2 ⊗ x2 ) = h(w1 , w2)x1 ∧ x2 + η(w1 , w2 )x1 ∨ x2 ,
where w1 , w2 ∈ W and x1 , x2 ∈ Rl . Then πC defines on (p(V ) + C) + W ⊗ Rl the
structure of central charge extension of p(V ) with symmetry group O(l).
   Analogeously, we can define on (p(V ) + C) + W ⊗R2l , C = Rr ⊗∨2 R2l + Rs ⊗∧2 R2l ,
the structure of central charge super extension of p(V ) with symmetry group Sp(2l, R)
by
                               πC : ∨2 (W ⊗ R2l ) → C ,

            πC (w1 ⊗ x1 , w2 ⊗ x2 ) = h(w1 , w2)x1 ∨ x2 + η(w1 , w2 )x1 ∧ x2 .
Example 3: Let p(V ) + W be a super extension of p(V ). Consider the super
extension g(+l) = p(V ) + W ⊗ Rl with internal symmetry group H = O(l) and let h
be a symmetric and η a skew symmetric vector valued so(V )-invariant bilinear form
on W , as above. Define
                 πC : ∨2 (W ⊗ Rl ) → C = Rr ⊗ ∨2 Rl + Rs ⊗ ∧2 Rl ,

            πC (w1 ⊗ x1 , w2 ⊗ x2 ) = h(w1 , w2)x1 ∨ x2 + η(w1 , w2 )x1 ∧ x2 .
Then πC defines on (p(V )+C)+W ⊗Rl the structure of central charge super extension
of p(V ) with symmetry group O(l).
10                    DMITRY V. ALEKSEEVSKY AND VICENTE CORTÉS

  Analogeously, we can define on (p(V ) + C) + W ⊗ R2l , C = Rr ⊗ ∧2 R2l + Rs ⊗ ∨2 R2l
the structure of central charge extension of p(V ) with symmetry group Sp(2l, R) by
                                  πC : ∧2 (W ⊗ R2l ) → C ,

               πC (w1 ⊗ x1 , w2 ⊗ x2 ) = h(w1 , w2)x1 ∧ x2 + η(w1 , w2 )x1 ∨ x2 .
  In the physical literature (s. [F]) the expression “central charges” is used for a
special case of Example 3.
1.3. Reduction of the classification of N-extended Poincaré algebras to
the cases N = ±1, ±2. Let g = g(ρ, π) = p(V ) + W be a ±N-extended Poincaré
algebra, N = 1, 2, . . . . Then either the spinor representation ρ0 : so(V ) → gl(S) is
irreducible and ρ = Nρ0 , W = NS = S ⊗ RN , or it decomposes into two irreducible
subrepresentations ρ0 = ρ+ + ρ− , S = S + + S − and ρ = N+ ρ+ + N− ρ− , W =
N+ S + + N− S − = S + ⊗ RN+ + S − ⊗ RN− , N = N+ + N− . The description of all ǫN-
extended Poincaré algebras g(ρ, π) reduces to the description of all so(V )-equivariant
mappings π : ∧2 W → V if ǫ = −1 and π : ∨2 W → V if ǫ = +1. If π 6= 0, the
dual mapping defines an so(V )-equivariant embedding π ∗ : V ∗ ֒→ ∧2 W ∗ if ǫ = −1 or
π ∗ : V ∗ ֒→ ∨2 W ∗ if ǫ = +1. To find all such embeddings it is suficient to determine
all submodules isomorphic to V ∗ in ∧2 W ∗ and ∨2 W ∗ or, equivalently, all vector
submodules V in ∧2 W and ∨2 W . Tables 2 and 3 reduce this problem to the cases
N = 1 or 2.

where S0 ∼= S ± and N = N+ + N− . Table 2 shows that the classification of all
equivariant embeddings V ֒→ ∨2 W (case ǫ = +1) reduces to finding all equivariant
embeddings V ֒→ ∨2 S and V ֒→ ∧2 S if S is irreducible and equivariant embeddings
V ֒→ ∨2 S ± , V ֒→ ∧2 S ± and V ֒→ S + ⊗ S − if S = S + + S − . Table 3 shows that the
same reduction applies to the case ǫ = −1, i.e. to the problem of finding all equivariant

embeddings V ֒→ ∧2 S. We see that e.g. the classification of N-extended Poincaré
algebras for N > 0 (i.e. super algebra extensions) reduces to the classification of
N = ±1-extended Poincaré algebras in case there is only one irreducible spin 1/2
representation of so(V ). The same is true for N < 0, i.e. for Lie algebra extensions.
  To illustrate this reduction we consider the case ǫ = +1 and ρ = Nρ0 in more
detail.
Lemma 1.3. Assume ǫ = +1 and ρ = Nρ0 , where ρ0 is an irreducible spin 1/2
representation on S0 . Then any so(V )-equivariant embedding
                   j : V ֒→ ∨2 W = ∨2 S0 ⊗ ∨2 RN + ∧2 S0 ⊗ ∧2 RN
is given by
                               X                   X
                      j(v) =       φa (v) ⊗ Aa +       ψb (v) ⊗ Bb ,
                               a                   b

where φa : V → ∨2 S0 and ψb : V → ∧2 S0 are equivariant embeddings, Aa ∈ ∨2 RN
and Bb ∈ ∧2 RN .
  Proof: Choose bases (Aa ) and (Bb ) of ∨2 RN and ∧2 RN respectively. Then j(v) can
be decomposed as above and the coefficients φa and ψb are equivariant embeddings
or zero.
1.4. Equivariant embeddings V ∗ ֒→ S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ , modified Clifford multiplica-
tions and Dirac operators. We reduced the problem of the classification of N-
extended Poincaré algebras to the description of so(V )-equivariant mappings V ∗ →
S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ , where S is the spinor module of so(V ). We will denote by J the vector
space of all such mappings.
   Now we will show that this space is closely related to two other vector spaces:
    • the space B of all so(V )-invariant bilinear forms on S and
    • the space M of so(V )-equivariant multiplications µ : V ∗ ⊗ S → S.
Denote by C the Schur algebra of so(V )-invariant endomorphisms of S. We define
two natural anti-representations of C on B and J and also a representation and an

anti-representation of C on M by:

                              (ηAM µ)(v ∗ ) = µ(v ∗ ) ◦ A ,
where A ∈ C, v ∗ ∈ V ∗ , β ∈ B, j ∈ J and µ ∈ M ⊂ Hom(V ∗ , End S). Remark that
a non zero equivariant mapping j : V ∗ → S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ is automatically an embedding.
Definition 1.5. An equivariant embedding j : V ∗ → S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ is called non degen-
erate, if j(V ∗ )S = S ∗ and j(S) ∼ = S, where we consider j as mapping j : S →
V ⊗ S ∗ . An equivariant multiplication µ : V ∗ ⊗ S → S is called non degenerate, if
µ(V ∗ )S = S.
  Using the following identifications, we define mappings from two of the spaces B,
J and M into the third.
              B = (S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ )so(V ) ,

Theorem 1.4. The choice of a non degenerate element β0 , j0 or µ0 in any of the
spaces B, J and M defines vector space isomorphisms between the two others:
                            jβ0 : M             →   J
                                    µ       7 →     j(β0 , µ) = β0 ◦ µ ,
                            µβ0 : J            →    M
                                    j          7→   µ(β0 , j) = β0 ◦ j ;
                            βj0 : M             →   B
                                    µ   7 →         β(µ, j0) = µ ◦ j0 ,
                             µj 0 : B   →           M
                                    β         7→    µ(β, j0) = β ◦ j0 ;
                             jµ0 : B    →           J
                                    β     7→        j(β, µ0) = β ◦ µ0 ,
                            βµ0 : J        →        B
                                    j      7→       β(µ0, j) = µ0 ◦ j .
   Proof: The statement is trivial for jβ0 and µβ0 , because these mappings amount
to “raising and lowering” indices of tensors via the non degenerate form β0 .
   It is clear that µj0 and jµ0 are injective, since j0 and µ0 are non degenerate. Hence,
it is sufficient to prove that βj0 and βµ0 are injective.
   Consider first βµ0 (j) = µ0 ◦ j, where j : S → V ∗ ⊗ S ∗ and µ0 : V ∗ ⊗ S ∗ → S ∗ . The
kernel of βµ0 equals
                           ker βµ0 = {j ∈ J |j(S) ⊂ ker µ0 }
If 0 6= j ∈ ker βµ0 , then ker µ0 contains the non trivial submodule j(S). This
is impossible, because ker µ0 does not contain spin 1/2 submodules. Indeed, after
complexification the so(V C )-module (V ∗ )C ⊗ (S ∗ )C has the decomposition
                   (V ∗ )C ⊗ (S ∗ )C = Σ ⊕ (S ∗ )C = (ker µC0 ) ⊕ (S ∗ )C ,
where Σ = ker µC0 contains only spin 3/2 modules, i.e. Kronecker product of the
vector module V C ∼  = (V ∗ )C (spin 1) and an irreducible spin 1/2 module.
   Consider now βj0 (µ) = µ ◦ j0 , where j0 : S → V ∗ ⊗ S ∗ and µ : V ∗ ⊗ S ∗ → S ∗ .
As before we have the decomposition (V ∗ )C ⊗ (S ∗ )C = Σ ⊕ (S ∗ )C , where Σ has no
submodules isomorphic to submodules of (S ∗ )C . If µ 6= 0, ker µC = Σ ⊕ S1C , where
S1C 6= (S ∗ )C is a proper submodule of (S ∗ )C . Since j0 is non degenerate j0 (S) ∼
                                                                                    =S
cannot be contained in ker µ.
Lemma 1.5. Let S be the spinor module of so(V ). There always exists a non de-
generate so(V )-invariant bilinear form β on S.
14                  DMITRY V. ALEKSEEVSKY AND VICENTE CORTÉS

   Proof: The existence of β is equivalent to the self duality of S, i.e. to the condition
S∗ ∼= S as so(V )-modules.
   The self duality of the complex so(V C ) spinor module S follows from the criterion
of self duality given in [O-V] p. 195.
   Now we discuss the real case. Assume first S C has the same number of irreducible
summands as S. Then the self duality of S follows from that of S C , s. [O-V] p.
291. In the opposite case S admits an invariant complex structure J and (S, J) ∼      =S
(complex spinor module of so(V C )). Then the real part of a non degenerate complex
so(V C )-invariant bilinear form on S = S gives a real so(V )-invariant bilinear form on
S and it is easy to check that this form is non degenerate.
   From Theorem 1.4 and this lemma we now derive an important consequence. Recall
that by definition the spinor module S is a module over the Clifford algebra Cℓ(V ).
The restriction of the multiplication mapping Cℓ(V ) × S → S to V × S defines a non
degenerate so(V )-equivariant multiplication ρ : V ⊗ S ∼ = V ∗ ⊗ S → S, which is called
Clifford multiplication (as above V and V ∗ are identified using the pseudo Euclidean
scalar product of V ). The composition j(β, ρ) = β ◦ ρ with a non degenerate so(V )-
invariant form β gives a non degenerate so(V )-equivariant embedding V ∗ ֒→ S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ .
Using the lemma and this remark, we obtain the following corollary from Theorem
1.4.
Corollary 1.6. The spaces B of so(V )-invariant bilinear forms on S, J of so(V )-
equivariant mappings V ∗ → S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ and M of so(V )-equivariant multiplications
V ∗ ⊗ S → S are isomorphic. In particular, Clifford multiplication ρ defines the
isomorphism jρ : B → J and hence any so(V )-equivariant embedding V ∗ ֒→ S ∗ ⊗ S ∗
is of the form
                  j = jρ (β) : v ∗ 7→ β(ρ(v ∗ )·, ·) ,       β ∈ B,   v∗ ∈ V ∗ .
   Remark 2: Using an so(V )-equivariant multiplications µ : V ∗ ⊗ S → S one
can define a Dirac type operator D µ on a pseudo Riemannian spin manifold M as
follows. Let µx : Tx∗ M ⊗ Sx → Sx be a field of equivariant multiplications, where
S(M) = ∪x∈M Sx → M is the spinor bundle. Then
                                                 X
                       (D µ s)x = µx (∇s) = µx (   ei ⊗ ∇ei s) ,
                                                         i

where (ei ) is a basis of Tx M, (ei ) the dual basis of Tx∗ M and ∇ is the spinor connection
induced by the Levi Civita connection.

1.5. Z2 -graded type and Schur algebra C. It is well known (s. [L-M]), that every
Clifford algebra Cℓ(V ), V = Rp,q , is isomorphic to K(l) or to 2K(l) = K(l) ⊕ K(l),
where K(l) is the full matrix algebra over K of rank l depending on (p, q) and where
K = R, C or H.

Definition 1.6. We say that a Clifford algebra Cℓ(V ) has type rK, r = 1 or 2, if
Cℓ(V ) ∼
       = rK(l) for some l ∈ N.
  Recall that the Clifford algebra Cℓ(V ) has a natural Z2 -grading Cℓ(V ) = Cℓ0(V ) +
Cℓ1(V ). If V = Rp,q (6= 0), then the even part Cℓ0(V ) is isomorphic to the Clifford
algebra Cℓ(V ′ ) of V ′ = Rp−1,q if p ≥ 1 and V ′ = Rq−1 if p = 0. Remark that
dim Cℓ0 (V ) = dim Cℓ(V )/2. By the preceding remarks, the following definition makes
sense.
Definition 1.7. The pair
                 t(Cℓ(V )) = (r0 K0 , rK) = (type Cℓ0 (V ), type Cℓ(V ))
is called the Z2 -graded type of the Clifford algebra Cℓ(V ).
  The following proposition describes the periodicity of the type t of the Z2 -graded
Clifford algebras Cℓp,q = Cℓ(Rp,q ).
Proposition 1.7. The Z2 -graded type tp,q = t(Cℓp,q ) depends only on the signature
s = p − q modulo 8 and t(s) = t(p − q) = tp,q is given in the table.

              s   1    2     3     4    5    6     7     8
            t(s) R, C C, H H, 2H 2H, H H, C C, R R, 2R 2R, R
  Proof: The proof reduces to the investigation of [L-M] Table II.
Corollary 1.8. The Z2 -graded type tp,q = t(s = p − q) is mirror symmetric with
respect to the diagonal {p + q = 0}: tp,q = t−q,−p ; in other words, t(Cℓp,q ) =
t(Cℓ8k−q,8k−p), 8k ≥ p, q.
  Moreover, the Z2 -graded type tp,q = t(s) = (t0 (s), t1 (s)) is mirror super symmetric
with respect to the axis {s = p − q = 3.5}, i.e.
                         (t0 (7 − s), t1 (7 − s)) = (t1 (s), t0 (s)) .
   The type rC and Z2 -graded type tm = (r0 C, rC) of a complex Clifford algebra
Cℓm = Cℓ(Cm ) are defined by putting V = Cm in Definition 1.6 and 1.7, where Cm
is equippedPwith a non degenerate (complex) bilinear form, e.g. the standard one:
< z, w >= m                      m
             j=1 zj wj , z, w ∈ C .

Proposition 1.9. The Z2 -graded type tm = t(Cℓm ) depends only on the parity of m:
                             
                               (2C, C) if m is even
                      tm =
                               (C, 2C) if m is odd
   Let S = Sp,q be an irreducible Cℓp,q -module. Recall that by definition the Schur
algebra C = Cp,q of S is the algebra of all its so(V )-invariant endomorphisms; it is
the algebra of endomorphisms which commute with Cℓ0p,q . Analogously, we define the
                c
Schur algebra Cm  of the complex spinor module S; it is the algebra of endomorphism
of S commuting with Cℓ0m .

Corollary 1.10. The Schur algebra Cp,q = C(p − q) depends only on s = p − q
modulo 8 and is given in the table. In particular, it admits the mirror symmetry
(p, q) 7→ (−q, −p).

                   s      1    2   3   4   5 6 7   8
                  C(s)   R(2) C(2) H H ⊕ H H C R R ⊕ R

   Proof: Remark that if t(Cℓp,q ) = (r0 K0 , rK) and hence Cℓ0p,q ∼= r0 K0 (l0 ), Cℓp,q ∼
                                                                                         =
rK(l), then l is completely determined by l0 and vice versa; l = l0 or 2l0 . This follows
from dim Cℓp,q = 2 dim Cℓ0p,q .
                                                                0
   Using this remark, Proposition 1.7 shows that the pair (Clp,q  , Clp,q ) is isomorphic
to one of the following:
                                                          l
                              (K(l), K′ (l)) ,     S = K′ ,
                              (K(l), 2K(l)) ,      S = Kl ,
                             (K′ (l), K(2l)) ,     S = K2l ,
                             (2K(l), K(2l)) ,      S = K2l ,
where K = R, C or H and R′ = C, C′ = H.
  In the first case the K(l)-module S = K′ l is a sum of two irreducible equivalent
modules S ± ∼= Kl and hence the Schur algebra C ∼ = K(2).
  In the second (respectively third) case S = Kl (respectively K2l ) is irreducible as
K(l)- (respectively K′ (l)-) module and hence C ∼
                                                = K (respectively K′ ).
  In the last case C ∼
                     = K ⊕ K, which follows from the next lemma.
Lemma 1.11. Let S = K2l be the irreducible module of the algebra K(2l) and A ∼ =
2K(l) a subalgebra of K(2l), then the A-module S is decomposed into a sum of two
nonequivalent submodules S ± .
   Proof: It is clear that the A-module S is the sum of two irreducible submodules
S + and S − . They are not equivalent because A|S + and A|S − have different kernels,
namely the two ideals K(l) ⊂ A.
   Remark that the algebras C ⊕ C and H(2) do not occur as Schur algebras of the
real spinor module S.
                                   c
Corollary 1.12. The Schur algebra Cm of the complex spinor module S depends only
on the parity of m:
                              
                        c       C ⊕ C if m is even
                      Cm =
                                     C if m is odd
  The proof of Corollary 1.10 shows that the structure of the matrix algebra C
contains the following information about the Cℓ0(V )-module S.
       N -(SUPER)-EXTENDED POINCARÉ ALGEBRAS AND BILINEAR INVARIANTS                17

Proposition 1.13. C is a simple K-matrix algebra (respectively a sum of two iso-
morphic K-matrix algebras) if and only if Cℓ0 (V ) is a simple K-matrix algebra (re-
spectively a sum of two isomorphic such algebras). S is an irreducible Cℓ0 (V )-module
if and only if C ∼= K (= R, C or H). S is decomposed into a sum of two equiva-
lent (respectively inequivalent) Cℓ0(V )-modules if and only if C ∼
                                                                  = K(2) (respectively
C∼ = K ⊕  K).
  The corresponding statement in the complex case is given for the sake of complete-
ness:
Proposition 1.14. If m is even, then the spinor module S = Sm is the sum S =
S+ + S− of two inequivalent irreducible Cℓ0m -modules. In this case, Cℓ0m and the Schur
          c
algebra Cm  are the direct sum of two isomorphic simple (complex) matrix algebras.
   If m is odd, then the spinor module is an irreducible module of the simple matrix
algebra Cℓ0m and its Schur algebra is also simple.
   Since, due to Lemma 1.5, S admits a non degenerate so(p, q)-invariant bilinear
form, by Schur’s Lemma the dimension bp,q of the space B = Bp,q of so(p, q)-invariant
bilinear forms on S equals
                              bp,q = dim Bp,q = dim Cp,q .
Hence we have:
Corollary 1.15. bp,q = b(p − q) is a periodic function of s = p − q with period 8. In
particular, it admits the mirror symmetry (p, q) 7→ (−q, −p). Its values are given in
the following table.

forms on the complex spinor module S, then bm = dimC Cm   and we have:

  2. Fundamental invariants τ , σ and ι and reduction to the basic
                   signatures (m, m), (k, 0) and (0, k)
2.1. Fundamental invariants. As before let V denote a pseudo Euclidean vector
space and S its spinor module. In Corollary 1.6 we have established that every
so(V )-equivariant embedding j : V ∗ ֒→ S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ is of the form
                      j = jρ (β) : v ∗ 7→ β(ρ(v ∗ )·, ·) ,   v∗ ∈ V ∗ ,
where ρ is Clifford multiplication and β ∈ B. The dimension of the space B of
so(V )-invariant bilinear forms on S was given in Corollary 1.15.
18                 DMITRY V. ALEKSEEVSKY AND VICENTE CORTÉS

  Now we will concentrate on a class of bilinear forms β ∈ B for which jρ (β)V ∗ ⊂
∨ S ∗ or jρ (β)V ∗ ⊂ ∧2 S ∗ and define fundamental invariants τ , σ and ι for this class.

Definition 2.1. A bilinear form β on the spinor module S is called admissible if
it has the following properties:
   1) Clifford multiplication ρ(v), v ∈ V , is either β-symmetric or β-skew symmetric.
      We define the type τ of β to be τ (β) = +1 in the first case and τ (β) = −1 in
      the second.
   2) The bilinear form β is symmetric or skew symmetric. Accordingly, we define
      the symmetry σ of β to be σ(β) = ±1.
   3) If the spinor module is reducible, S = S + + S − , then S ± are either mutually
      orthogonal or isotropic. We put ι(β) = +1 in the first case, ι(β) = −1 in the
      second and call ι(β) the isotropy of β.
   Due to 1) every admissible form β is so(V )-invariant and hence defines an so(V )-
equivariant embedding jρ (β) : V ∼= V ∗ ֒→ S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ . In addition, jρ (β)V ⊂ ∨2 S ∗ if
τ (β)σ(β) = +1 and jρ (β)V ⊂ ∧2 S ∗ if τ (β)σ(β) = −1. If S = S + + S − , then for
every bilinear form γ ∈ jρ (β)V the semi spinor modules S ± are either γ-isotropic (if
ι(γ) = −ι(β) = −1) or mutually γ-orthogonal (if ι(γ) = −ι(β) = +1).
   Given an admissible form β ∈ B and A ∈ C the composition β ◦ A = β(A·, ·) ∈ B
is in general not admissible. However, if A is β-admissible (see Definition 2.2 below)
then β ◦ A is admissible.
Definition 2.2. Let β ∈ B be admissible. An endomorphism A of S is called β-
admissible if it has the following properties:
  1) Clifford multiplication ρ(v), v ∈ V , either commutes or anticommutes with A.
     We define the type τ of A to be τ (A) = +1 in the first case and τ (A) = −1 in
     the second.
  2) A is β-symmetric or β-skew symmetric. Accordingly, we define the β-symmetry
     σ of A to be σβ (A) = ±1.
  3) If the spinor module is reducible, S = S + + S − , then either AS ± ⊂ S ± or
     AS ± ⊂ S ∓ . We put ι(A) = +1 in the first case, ι(A) = −1 in the second and
     call ι(A) the isotropy of A.
  Due to 1) every β-admissible endomorphism A is so(V )-invariant and hence β ◦A ∈
B. Moreover, β ◦ A is admissible and the fundamental invariants are multiplicative:
                               τ (β ◦ A) = τ (β)τ (A) ,
                               σ(β ◦ A) = σ(β)σ(A) ,
                               ι(β ◦ A) = ι(β)ι(A) .
  In section 3.1 (s. Definition 3.1), for every pseudo Euclidean space V , we will
construct a canonical non degenerate so(V )-invariant bilinear form h on the spinor

module S. We will define that an endomorphism A of S is admissible of symmetry
σ(A) = ±1, if A is h-admissible and σh (A) = ±1.
Remark 3: The complete classification of admissible forms β ∈ B, which we will
give in this paper, implies the following. Let γ ∈ B be non degenerate and admissible.
Then a γ-admissible endomorphism A ∈ C is β-admissible for every admissible β ∈ B.
In particular, admissibility (i.e. h-admissibility) implies β-admissibility.

2.2. Reduction to the basic signatures. Let V1 and V2 be pseudo Euclidean
spaces and V = V1 + V2 their orthogonal sum. We recall (s. [L-M] I. Prop. 1.5) that
there is a canonical isomorphism of Z2 -graded algebras
                                Cℓ(V ) ∼        ˆ
                                       = Cℓ(V1 )⊗Cℓ(V 2) ,

      ˆ denotes the Z2 -graded tensor product of Z2 -graded algebras.
where ⊗
Proposition 2.1. Let M1 = M10 + M11 be a Z2 -graded Cℓ(V1)-module and M2 a (not
necessarily Z2 -graded) Cℓ(V2)-module. Then M = M1 ⊗M2 carries a natural structure
of Cℓ(V )-module, V = V1 + V2 , given by:
                (a1 ⊗ a2 )(m1 ⊗ m2 ) = (−1)deg(a2 ) deg(m1 ) a1 m1 ⊗ a2 m2 ,
where ai ∈ Cℓ(Vi ), mi ∈ Mi , i = 1, 2. If M2 = M20 + M21 is a Z2 -graded Cℓ(V2)-
module, then this formula defines on M the structure of Z2 -graded Cℓ(V )-module:
M 0 = M10 ⊗ M20 + M11 ⊗ M21 , M 1 = M10 ⊗ M21 + M11 ⊗ M20 .

Corollary 2.2. Let Si be an irreducible Cℓ(Vi )-module, i = 1, 2, and assume that
S1 = S1+ + S1− is reducible as Cℓ0(V1 )-module. Then S = S1 ⊗ S2 is an irreducible
                  ˆ
(Cℓ(V ) = Cℓ(V1)⊗Cℓ(V                       0                                +   −
                        2 ))-module. The Cℓ (V )-module S is reducible, S = S + S ,
                                                         +    −
if and only if S2 is reducible as Cℓ0(V2 )-module, S2 = S2 + S2 .
Proof: Let S1 be an irreducible Cℓ(V1 )-module which is reducible as Cℓ0 (V1 )-module
and let S1+ be an irreducible Cℓ0 (V1 )-submodule. Then
                                S1′ := Cℓ(V1 ) ⊗Cℓ0 (V1 ) S1+
is an irreducible Cℓ(V1 )-module, hence S1 ∼    = S1′ as Cℓ(V1 )-modules. Moreover, S1′
is a Z2 -graded Cℓ(V1 )-module (s. [L-M] I. Prop. 5.20): S1′ = S1′ 0 + S1′ 1 , S1′ 0 =
Cℓ0(V1 ) ⊗Cℓ0 (V1 ) S1+ ∼            1             0
                        = S1+ and S1′ = Cℓ1(V1 )S1′ = Cℓ1(V1 ) ⊗Cℓ0 (V1 ) S1+ .
   Therefore, we may assume (as usual) that S1 = S1+ + S1− is a Z2 -graded Cℓ(V1 )-
module: S10 = S1+ , S11 = S1− = Cℓ1(V1 )S1+ , reducing the first statement to Proposition
2.1. The remaining statements also follow from the structure of Z2 -graded Clifford
module on S1 and on S2 (in the reducible case).
   Now we investigate the algebraic properties of the fundamental invariants with
respect to Z2 -graded tensor products.

Proposition 2.3. Under the assumptions of Corollary 2.2 let βi be admissible bilin-
ear forms on Si , i = 1, 2.
  If τ (β1 ) = ι(β1 )τ (β2 ), then β = β1 ⊗ β2 is admissible and
                                  τ (β) = τ (β1 ) = ι(β1 )τ (β2 ) ,
                                  σ(β) = σ(β1 )σ(β2 ) ,
                                  ι(β) = ι(β1 )ι(β2 ) ,
where ι(β) and ι(β2 ) are defined if and only if S2 (and hence S) is reducible as module
of the even part of the corresponding Clifford algebra.
   Let Ai be βi -admissible endomorphisms of Si , i = 1, 2. If τ (A1 ) = ι(A1 )τ (A2 ), then
A = A1 ⊗ A2 is admissible and
                                  τ (A) = τ (A1 ) = ι(A1 )τ (A2 ) ,
                                 σβ (A) = σβ1 (A1 )σβ2 (A2 ) ,
                                  ι(A) = ι(A1 )ι(A2 ) ,
where ι(A) and ι(A2 ) are defined if and only if S2 is reducible as Cℓ0(V2 )-module.
Proof: The only non trivial statements are the ones concerning the type τ . For si ,
ti ∈ Si and vi ∈ Vi we compute:
             β((v1 ⊗ 1)(s1 ⊗ s2 ), t1 ⊗ t2 ) = β(v1 s1 ⊗ s2 , t1 ⊗ t2 ) =
                      β1 (v1 s1 , t1 )β2 (s2 , t2 ) = τ (β1 )β1 (s1 , v1 t1 )β2 (s2 , t2 ) =
               τ (β1 )β(s1 ⊗ s2 , v1 t1 ⊗ t2 ) = τ (β1 )β(s1 ⊗ s2 , (v1 ⊗ 1)(t1 ⊗ t2 ))
and
          β((1 ⊗ v2 )(s1 ⊗ s2 ), t1 ⊗ t2 ) = (−1)deg s1 β(s1 ⊗ v2 s2 , t1 ⊗ t2 ) =
         (−1)deg s1 β1 (s1 , t1 )β2 (v2 s2 , t2 ) = (−1)deg s1 τ (β2 )β1 (s1 , t1 )β2 (s2 , v2 t2 ) =

                               (−1)deg s1 τ (β2 )β(s1 ⊗ s2 , t1 ⊗ v2 t2 ) =

                        (−1)deg s1 +deg t1 τ (β2 )β(s1 ⊗ s2 , (1 ⊗ v2 )(t1 ⊗ t2 )) .
     If ι(β1 ) = (−1)deg s1 +deg t1 we obtain
(1)        β((1 ⊗ v2 )(s1 ⊗ s2 ), t1 ⊗ t2 ) = ι(β1 )τ (β2 )β(s1 ⊗ s2 , (1 ⊗ v2 )(t1 ⊗ t2 )) .
Otherwise, both sides of (1) vanish. Hence, the equation (1) is always true.
  Similarly we have:
             (v1 ⊗ 1)((A1 ⊗ A2 )(s1 ⊗ s2 )) = τ (A1 )(A1 ⊗ A2 )((v1 ⊗ 1)(s1 ⊗ s2 ))
and
          (1 ⊗ v2 )((A1 ⊗ A2 )(s1 ⊗ s2 )) = (1 ⊗ v2 )(A1 s1 ⊗ A2 s2 ) =
            (−1)deg(A1 s1 ) A1 s1 ⊗ v2 A2 s2 = (−1)deg(A1 s1 ) τ (A2 )A1 s1 ⊗ A2 v2 s2 =
       N -(SUPER)-EXTENDED POINCARÉ ALGEBRAS AND BILINEAR INVARIANTS                21

                      (−1)deg(A1 s1 ) τ (A2 )(A1 ⊗ A2 )(s1 ⊗ v2 s2 ) =

               (−1)deg(A1 s1 )+deg s1 τ (A2 )(A1 ⊗ A2 )((1 ⊗ v2 )(s1 ⊗ s2 )) =

                   ι(A1 )τ (A2 )(A1 ⊗ A2 )((1 ⊗ v2 )(s1 ⊗ s2 )) .
   Now we point out that every pseudo Euclidean space V can be decomposed as
orthogonal sum V = V1 + V2 such that the assumptions of Corollary 2.2 are satisfied,
i.e. such that the spinor Cℓ0 (V1 )-module S1 is reducible. In fact, we can decompose
V into V1 = Rm,m and V2 = Rk,0 or R0,k .
Proposition 2.4. Let V = V1 + V2 be the orthogonal sum of the pseudo Euclidean
spaces V1 = Rm,m and V2 . Let S1 be an irreducible Cℓ(V1 )-module. Then S1 = S1+ +S1−
is a sum of two inequivalent irreducible Cℓ0 (V1 )-submodules S1± and an irreducible
                 ˆ
(Cℓ(V ) = Cℓ(V1)⊗Cℓ(V 2 ))-module S is given by S = S1 ⊗S2 , where S2 is an irreducible
Cℓ(V2)-module. S is reducible as Cℓ0 (V )-module if and only if S2 is reducible as
Cℓ0(V2 )-module.
Proof: The first statement follows from the fact that the Schur algebra of S1 is
Cm,m = C(s = m − m = 0) = R ⊕ R. Now all other statements follow immediately
from Corollary 2.2.

               3. Case of signature (m, m) and complex case
3.1. Signature (m, m). Let U and U ∗ denote two complementary isotropic sub-
spaces of V = Rm,m , so V = U + U ∗ . We denote by < ·, · > the scalar product of V
and identify U ∗ with the dual space to U by
                       u∗ (u) = < u, u∗ > ,      u∗ ∈ U ∗ , u ∈ U .

Proposition 3.1. The following formulas define an irreducible Cℓm,m -module on S =
∧U:
                      ρ(u)s = u ∧ s
                     ρ(u∗ )s = −u∗ ∠s , s ∈ ∧U , u ∈ U , u∗ ∈ U ∗ .
Proof: This follows from the obvious identities ρ(u)2 = ρ(u∗ )2 = 0 and ρ(u)ρ(u∗ ) +
ρ(u∗ )ρ(u) = −2< u, u∗ >Id.
  For any a ∈ ∧U and α ∈ ∧U ∗ we define nilpotent endomorphisms ǫa and ια of
S = ∧U by:
                                        ǫa = a ∧ s ,
                                        ια = α∠s .

Proposition 3.2. The Lie algebra so(m, m) ֒→ End S of the spinor group admits
the following graded decomposition:
                  so(m, m) = g−2 + g0 + g2 = ι∧2 U ∗ + sl(U) + ǫ∧2 U ,
sl(U) = [ιU ∗ , ǫU ], [gi , gj ] ⊂ gi+j (gi+j = 0 for |i + j| > 2). In particular, ι∧2 U ∗ and
ǫ∧2 U are Abelian subalgebras.
 It is very easy to describe the semi spinor modules S ± in our model of the spinor
module S.
Lemma 3.3. S = ∧U is the sum of the two inequivalent irreducible so(m, m)-
submodules S + = ∧ev U and S − = ∧odd U.
Proof: It is clear that ∧ev U and ∧odd U are irreducible so(m, m)-submodules and we
already know that they are inequivalent, s. e.g. Proposition 2.4.
Remark 4: The statement that ∧ev U and ∧odd U are inequivalent so(m, m)-modules
follows also from the fact that these are eigenspaces of the volume element ωm,m =
e1 · · · e2m ∈ Cℓ0m,m , (ei ) an orthonormal basis of Rm,m .
   We can define an so(m, m)-invariant endomorphism E of S by
                                        E|S ± = ±Id .
To construct an admissible bilinear form f on S = ∧U we fix a volume form vol ∈
∧m U on U ∗ and define
                           f (∧i U, ∧j U) = 0 ,     if i + j 6= m ,

                      f (s, t)vol = ǫi s ∧ t ,    s ∈ ∧i U , t ∈ ∧m−i U ,
where ǫi = (−1)i(i+1)/2 . Remark that ǫi+1 = (−1)i+1 ǫi .
Proposition 3.4. The space B of so(m, m)-invariant bilinear forms on S = Sm,m is
spanned by the admissible elements f and fE = f (E·, ·). Their fundamental invari-
ants (τ, σ, ι) depend only on m (mod 4) and are given in the next table:

                          f  −−− −−+ −+− −++
                          fE ++− +−+ +−− +++
                          m:   1        2       3       4
  An f - and fE -admissible basis for the Schur algebra C ∼
                                                          = R ⊕ R is given by the
endomorphisms Id and E of S:
              τ (E) = −1 ,      σf (E) = σfE (E) = (−1)m ,            ι(E) = +1 .
Proof: We first check that ρ(v), v ∈ U + U ∗ , is f -skew symmetric. For v = u ∈ U,
s ∈ ∧i U, t ∈ ∧m−i−1 U:
          (f (ρ(u)s, t) + f (s, ρ(u)t))vol = ǫi+1 (u ∧ s) ∧ t + ǫi s ∧ (u ∧ t) = 0 .
        N -(SUPER)-EXTENDED POINCARÉ ALGEBRAS AND BILINEAR INVARIANTS                    23

For v = u∗ ∈ U ∗ , s ∈ ∧i U, t ∈ ∧m−i+1 U:
         (f (ρ(u∗ )s, t) + f (s, ρ(u∗)t))vol = ǫi−1 (u∗ ∠s) ∧ t + ǫi s ∧ (u∗ ∠t) =

                 ǫi−1 (u∗ ∠s) ∧ t + ǫi (−1)i (u∗ ∠(s ∧ t) − (u∗ ∠s) ∧ t) =

                              (ǫi−1 − (−1)i ǫi )(u∗∠s) ∧ t = 0 .
The symmetry properties of f follow from the computation
         f (t, s)vol = ǫj t ∧ s = ǫj ǫi (−1)ij f (s, t)vol = (−1)m(m+1)/2 f (s, t)vol ,
where s ∈ ∧i U, t ∈ ∧j U and i + j = m.
Finally, f (∧ev U, ∧odd U) = 0 if m is even and f (∧ev U, ∧ev ) = f (∧odd U, ∧odd U) = 0 if
m is odd. This proves all the statements about f . It is immediate to see that E
is f -admissible with fundamental invariants given above. Since f is admissible and
E is f -admissible, fE is admissible and its fundamental invariants are computed by
multiplicativity:
           τ (fE ) = τ (f )τ (E) ,   σ(fE ) = σ(f )σf (E) ,    ι(fE ) = ι(f )ι(E) .
This proves the proposition.
Proposition 3.4 implies the following theorem:
Theorem 3.5. Every so(m, m)-equivariant embedding V ∗ ֒→ S ∗ ⊗ S ∗ , S = Sm,m the
spinor so(m, m)-module, is a linear combination of the embeddings jρ (f ) and jρ (fE ).
Their image is contained in the dual of the subspaces indicated in the table depending
on m (mod 4).

  Now put V1 = Rm,m 6= 0 and let V2 be an arbitrary pseudo Euclidean space. Denote
the spinor module of so(Vi ) by Si , i = 1, 2.
Proposition 3.6. Let β2 be an admissible bilinear form on S2 . Then there is a
unique (up to scaling) admissible form β1 on S1 such that τ (β2 ) = ι(β1 )τ (β1 ). In
particular, β1 ⊗ β2 is an admissible bilinear form on the spinor so(V1 + V2 )-module
S1 ⊗ S2 .
   If moreover, A2 is a β2 -admissible endomorphism of S2 , then there is a unique
β1 -admissible endomorphism A1 of S1 such that τ (A2 ) = ι(A1 )τ (A1 ), in partiular,
A1 ⊗ A2 is a β1 ⊗ β2 -admissible endomorphism of S1 ⊗ S2 .
   The fundamental invariants of β1 ⊗ β2 and A1 ⊗ A2 are easily computed using the
rules given in Proposition 2.3.

Proof: This follows from ι(fE )τ (fE ) = −ι(f )τ (f ), ι(E)τ (E) = −ι(Id)τ (Id) and
section 2.2.
  If we assume that V2 is of definite signature, i.e. V2 = Rk,0 or R0,k , then there is a
unique (up to scaling) P in(V2 )-invariant symmetric bilinear form h2 on the irreducible
module S2 of the compact group P in(V2 ).
Lemma 3.7. The P in(V2 )-invariant scalar product h2 is admissible: τ (h2 ) = −1
if V2 = Rk,0 and τ (h2 ) = +1 if V2 = R0,k ; σ(h2 ) = +1 and if S2 is reducible,
S2 = S2+ + S2− , S2− = Cℓ1 (V2 )S2+ , then ι(h2 ) = +1.
Proof: Let ρ(v) denote Clifford multiplication by a unit vector v ∈ V2 . Then h2 is
ρ(v)-invariant and ρ(v)2 = −Id if V2 = Rk,0 and ρ(v)2 = +Id if V2 = R0,k . This
implies τ (h2 ) = ∓1.
  To see that ι(h2 ) = +1 in the reducible case, consider the scalar product h′2 on S2
defined by
                       h′2 (S2+ , S2− ) = 0 ,   h′2 |S2± = h2 |S2± (6= 0) .
It is easy to check that h′2 is invariant under Clifford multiplication by unit vectors
v ∈ V2 using that S − = vS + . This implies h′2 = h2 .
   By Proposition 3.6 for every V1 = Rm,m 6= 0 there is a unique admissible bilinear
form h1 on the spinor module S1 of so(V1 ) such that τ (h2 ) = ι(h1 )τ (h1 ).
Definition 3.1. The canonical bilinear form on the spinor module S = S1 ⊗S2 of
so(V1 +V2 ) is h = h1 ⊗h2 , where h2 is the canonical bilinear form on the spinor module
S2 of so(V2 ) ∼= so(k), i.e. the P in(V2 )-invariant scalar product. In line with this
definition we say that an endomorphism A of S (respectively A2 of S2 ) is admissible
of symmetry σ(A) = ±1 (respectively σ(A2 ) = ±1) if A is h-admissible (respectively
h2 -admissible) and σh (A) = ±1 (respectively σh2 (A2 ) = ±1).
Remark 5: For V1 = Rm,m we have two (non degenerate) admissible bilinear forms
f and fE on S1 = Sm,m . If we want to choose a canonical one, which is not necessary
for our purpose, we can consider on S1 the structure of irreducible Cℓm,m+1 -module
defined in section 3.2. Then only one of the forms, namely fE , remains admissible
for the Cℓm,m+1 -module S1 = Sm,m+1 , it is in fact the canonical bilinear form on
this module. Moreover, the complex bilinear extension fEC of fE , is the unique (up
to scaling) so(2m + 1, C)-invariant complex bilinear form on the irreducible Cℓ2m+1 -
module S2m+1 = Sm,m+1 ⊗ C, s. Corollary 3.12.
3.2. Complex case. Case of even dimension:
The following theorem follows immediately from the fact that an irreducible module
S2m of Cℓ2m can be obtained as S2m = Sm,m ⊗ C and that S2m splits as Cℓ02m -module:
S2m = S+      −           ±     ±
        2m + S2m , where S2m = Sm,m ⊗ C.

Theorem 3.8. Every so(2m, C)-equivariant embedding C2m ֒→ S2m ⊗S2m is a linear
combination of the embeddings jρ (f )C and jρ (fE )C . Their image is contained in the

Case of odd dimension:
The odd dimensional complex case can be obtained from the real case of signature
(m, m + 1) by complexification.
  We fix the orthogonal decomposition (Rm,m+1 , < ·, · >) = Re0 + Rm,m , where
< e0 , e0 > = −1, and denote by ρ the irreducible representation of Cℓm,m on Sm,m
constructed in Proposition 3.1.
Proposition 3.9. An irreducible representation ρ̃ of Cℓm,m+1 on Sm,m+1 = Sm,m is
defined by
                          ρ̃|Rm,m = ρ|Rm,m ,   ρ̃(e0 ) = ρ(ωm,m ) ,
where ωm,m is the volume element of Cℓm,m . The Cℓ0m,m+1 -module Sm,m+1 is irre-
ducible and has Schur algebra Cm,m+1 = R Id.
Proof: It is sufficient to check that {ρ̃(e0 ), ρ(x)} = 0 for x ∈ Rm,m and that ρ̃(e0 )2 =
Id. This follows from the next lemma.
Lemma 3.10. The volume element ω = ωm,m = e1 e2 · · · e2m ((ei ) an orthonormal
basis of Rm,m ) of Cℓm,m satisfies {ω, x} = 0 for all x ∈ Rm,m and ω 2 = +1.

Proposition 3.11. Every so(m, m + 1)-invariant bilinear form on S = Sm,m+1 is a
multiple of the admissible (canonical) form fE (s. Proposition 3.4) and hence every
so(m, m + 1)-equivariant embedding Rm,m+1 ֒→ (S ⊗ S)∗ is proportional to the em-
bedding jρ̃ (fE ), which maps Rm,m+1 into ∨2 S ∗ if m ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4) and into ∧2 S ∗
if m ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4).
Proof: ρ̃(e0 ) = ρ(ωm,m ) is fE -symmetric and τ (fE ) = +1.

Proposition 4.1. If m ≡ 0 or 3 (mod 4) the following formulas define on S =
S2m,0 = Cℓm the structure of irreducible Cℓ2m -module:
                      ρ(x)s = xs
                      ρ(x̃)s = ωsx if m ≡ 0 (mod 4)
                      ρ(x̃)s = ωα(s)x if m ≡ 3 (mod 4) ,
where x ∈ Rm , s ∈ S and ω is the volume element of Cℓm, i.e. ω = e1 · · · em for an
orthonormal basis (ei ) of Rm . The so(2m)-module S is the sum S = S + + S − of the
two inequivalent irreducible modules S + = Cℓ0m and S − = Cℓ1m if m ≡ 0 (mod 4) and
is irreducible if m ≡ 3 (mod 4).
   If m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4) the structure of irreducible Cℓ2m -module on S = S2m,0 =
S2m = Cℓm is given by:
                       ρ(x)s = xs
                       ρ(x̃)s = iα(s)x ,          x ∈ Rm ,          s∈S.
As so(2m)-module S = S + + S − is the sum of the two irreducible modules S + = Cℓ0m
and S − = Cℓ1m , which are equivalent for m ≡ 1 (mod 4) and inequivalent for m ≡ 2
(mod 4).
Proof: It is sufficient to check the identities
                                    ρ(x)2 = −< x, x >Id,
                                    ρ(x̃)2 = −< x, x >Id,
                             {ρ(x), ρ(ỹ)} = 0
for x, y ∈ Rm . This is straightforward using the following lemma.
Lemma 4.2. The volume element ω = ωm = e1 · · · em of Cℓm satisfies {ω, x} = 0 if
m is even and [ω, x] = 0 if m is odd, x ∈ Rm ⊂ Cℓm . Moreover,

  Now we describe the P in(2m)-invariant symmetric bilinear form h on S using the
canonical identification ∧Rm → Cℓm of Z2 -graded vector spaces given by
                               ei1 ∧ . . . ∧ eik 7→ ei1 · · · eik
with respect to an orthonormal basis (ei ), i = 1, . . . , m, of Rm .
  The standard scalar product < ·, · > on ∧Rm induced by the scalar product on
Rm is invariant under exterior x ∧ · and interior x∠· multiplication with unit vectors
x ∈ Rm .

Lemma 4.3. Using the identification Cℓm = ∧Rm , Clifford multiplication of x ∈ Rm
and φ ∈ Cℓm is given by:
                             xφ = x ∧ φ − x∠φ
                             φx = x ∧ α(φ) + x∠α(φ) .
Proof: The proof is similar to [L-M] I.Prop. 3.9.
Corollary 4.4. The standard scalar product < ·, · > on ∧Rm = Cℓm is invariant
under left and right multiplications by unit vectors x ∈ Rm . In particular, if m ≡ 0
or 3 (mod 4), h = < ·, · > is the (admissible) P in(2m)-invariant scalar product on
the irreducible Cℓ2m -module S = Cℓm .
   If m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4), we extend the standard scalar product on ∧Rm to a
symmetric complex bilinear form < ·, · >C on S = ∧Cm . Using the operator c of
complex conjugation, we define a symmetric real bilinear form h = Re < c ·, · >C on
S.
Lemma 4.5. Let m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4). Then h = Re < c ·, · >C is the (admissible)
P in(2m)-invariant scalar product on the irreducible Cℓ2m -module S = Cℓm .
Proof: We check that ρ(x) and ρ(x̃), x ∈ Rm , are < c ·, · >C -skew symmetric and
hence h-skew symmetric. By Corollary 4.4 left and right multiplication, Lx and Rx ,
by x ∈ Rm are < ·, · >C -skew symmetric endomorphisms of S = Cℓm , in particular,
ρ(x) is < ·, · >C -skew symmetric. It is easy to see that α and the operator I of
multiplication by i are < ·, · >C -symmetric endomorphisms. Moreover,
                            [I, Rx ] = [I, α] = {α, Rx } = 0
and hence ρ(x̃) = I ◦ Rx ◦ α is < ·, · >C -symmetric. From the relations
                         [c, Lx ] = [c, Rx ] = [c, α] = {c, I} = 0
we obtain that [ρ(x), c] = {ρ(x̃), c} = 0, which implies that ρ(x) and ρ(x̃) are
< c ·, · >C -skew symmetric.
   Now we construct admissible, i.e. h-admissible, bases of the Schur algebra C = C2m,0
for all the values of m (mod 4).
Proposition 4.6. If m ≡ 0 (mod 4), an admissible basis of the Schur algebra
                               C2m,0 ∼
                                     =R⊕R
is given by the endomorphisms Id and E = α of S = Cℓm : τ (E) = −1, σ(E) =
σh (E) = +1, ι(E) = +1.
   If m ≡ 3 (mod 4), an admissible basis of C2m,0 ∼
                                                  = C is given by the endomorphisms
Id and J = Lω ◦ α of S = Cℓm : τ (J) = −1, σ(J) = −1.
   The space B of so(2m)-invariant bilinear forms on S is spanned by admissible
elements:
                      B = span {h, hE }     if m ≡ 0 (mod 4) ,
28                 DMITRY V. ALEKSEEVSKY AND VICENTE CORTÉS

                      B = span {h, hJ } if       m ≡ 3 (mod 4) .
The fundamental invariants (τ, σ, ι) are given by:
                  (τ, σ, ι)(h)    =   (−1, +1, +1),
                 (τ, σ, ι)(hE )   =   (+1, +1, +1) if m ≡ 0 (mod 4),
                     (τ, σ)(h)    =   (−1, +1),
                   (τ, σ)(hJ )    =   (+1, −1) if m ≡ 3 (mod 4).
Proof: We show that J is admissible and τ (J) = σ(J) = −1. All other statements
are immediate.
  Let m ≡ 3 (mod 4). From [Lx , Lω ] = [Rx , Lω ] = {Lx , α} = {Rx , α} = 0 (s. Lemma
4.2) it follows that {Lx , J} = {Rx , J} = 0. Since ρ(x) = Lx and ρ(x̃) = Rx ◦ J, we
conclude {ρ(x), J} = {ρ(x̃), J} = 0.
The operator J is skew symmetric as product of two anticommuting symmetric op-
erators, namely Lω and α (the scalar product is Lω -invariant and L2ω = +Id).
  If m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4), we consider the following operators on S = Cℓm :
                  I : s 7→ is , J = Lω ◦ c , K = IJ       and E = α ,
where ω = e1 · · · em ∈ Cℓm ⊂ Cℓm is the volume element.
Proposition 4.7. Let m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4). The Schur algebra C2m,0 (∼       = C(2) if
                     ∼
m ≡ 1 (mod 4) and = H ⊕ H if m ≡ 2 (mod 4)) is generated by the admissible
operators I, J and E satisfying the following (anti) commutator relations:
                        I 2 = J 2 = L2ω = −1 ,     E 2 = c2 = +1 ,

                        {I, J} = [I, E] = [I, Lω ] = {I, c} = 0 ,

                         [J, Lω ] = [J, c] = [E, c] = [Lω , c] = 0 ,

                    {J, E} = {Lω , E} = 0 if        m ≡ 1 (mod 4) ,

                     [J, E] = [Lω , E] = 0    if m ≡ 2       (mod 4) .
An admissible basis of the Schur algebra is given by the endomorphisms Id, I, J, K,
E, EI, EJ, EK. Their fundamental invariants (τ, σ, ι) are given in the next table,
where the value of m is modulo 4.

       m:    Id  I   J   K   E   EI  EJ  EK

       2    +++ +−+ −−+ −−+ −++ −−+ +−+ +−+
   The fundamental invariants of the corresponding admissible basis of B are also
listed for convenience:

Proof: The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 3.4 and 4.6. One uses
the multiplication rules for the invariants and also that Lω is skew symmetric, c is
symmetric and they commute.
Theorem 4.8. Every so(2m)-equivariant embedding R2m ֒→ (S ⊗ S)∗ , S = S2m,0 , is
a linear combination of the embeddings
            jρ (h) : R2m ֒→ (S + ∧ S − )∗   and jρ (hE ) : R2m ֒→ (S + ∨ S − )∗

4.2. Case of odd dimension. To reduce the odd dimensional case to the even
dimensional, we consider the orthogonal decomposition R2m+1 = Re0 + R2m , where
e0 is a unit vector. Let ρ denote the irreducible representation of Cℓ2m on S2m,0
defined in section 4.1. We will extend ρ to an irreducible representation ρ̃ of Cℓ2m+1
on S = S2m+1,0 , where S2m+1,0 = S2m,0 if m ≡ 1, 2 or 3 (mod 4) and S2m+1,0 =
S2m,0 ⊗ C = S2m if m ≡ 0 (mod 4). If m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4), S2m,0 = S2m admits
the Cℓ2m -invariant complex structure I. For m ≡ 0 (mod 4) multiplication by i is a
Cℓ2m -invariant complex structure on S2m,0 ⊗ C and will also be denoted by I.

Proposition 4.9. The following formulas define an irreducible representation ρ̃ of
Cℓ2m+1 on S2m+1,0 .
                                        ρ̃|R2m = ρ|R2m ,

                                    ρ(ω2m )   if m ≡ 1     or 3   (mod 4)
                ρ̃(e0 ) =
                                I ◦ ρ(ω2m )   if m ≡ 0     or 2   (mod 4) ,
where, in the case m ≡ 0 (mod 4), ρ has been extended complex linearly to a repre-
sentation on S2m,0 ⊗ C, denoted by the same symbol. S = S2m+1,0 is irreducible as
Cℓ02m+1 -module if m 6≡ 0 (mod 4) and the sum S = S + + S − of the two equivalent
                                    +        −
irreducible Cℓ02m+1 -modules S + = S2m,0 + iS2m,0 = Cℓ0m + iCℓ1m and S − = iS + if m ≡ 0
(mod 4).
Proof: It is sufficient to check that ρ̃(e0 )2 = −Id and {ρ̃(e0 ), ρ(x)} = 0 for x ∈ R2m ,
since all other information can be extracted from the Schur algebra, s. Corollary
1.10. These identities follow immediately from Lemma 4.2 and the fact that I is a
Cℓ2m -invariant complex structure.
   Now we describe the P in(2m + 1)-invariant scalar product h on S = S2m+1,0 . Let
h2m,0 denote the P in(2m)-invariant scalar product on S2m+1,0 = S2m,0 if m ≡ 1, 2
or 3 (mod 4) and by hC2m,0 the complex bilinear extension of the P in(2m)-invariant
scalar product on S2m,0 to a P in(2m)-invariant complex bilinear form on S2m+1,0 =
S2m = S2m,0 ⊗ C if m ≡ 4 (mod 4).
Lemma 4.10. The P in(2m+1)-invariant scalar product h = h2m+1,0 on S = S2m+1,0
is given by h = h2m,0 if m ≡ 1, 2 or 3 (mod 4) and by h = Re hC2m,0 (c ·, ·) if m ≡ 4
(mod 4), where c is complex conjugation with respect to S2m,0 ⊂ S2m,0 ⊗ C.
Proof: If m 6≡ 4 (mod 4), the statement follows from Schur’s Lemma, since S2m+1,0 =
S2m,0 . If m ≡ 4 (mod 4), the Hermitian form hC2m,0 (c ·, ·) is I-invariant and hence
invariant under ρ̃(e0 ) = I ◦ ρ(ω2m ) and the same is true for h = Re hC2m,0 (c ·, ·).
  If m 6≡ 3 (mod 4), we have on S2m+1,0 = Cℓm = Cℓm + iCℓm the operator c of
complex conjugation. Hence, we can define an endomorphism J of S2m+1,0 = Cℓm by
the formulas
                           
                              Lω ◦ c if m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4)
                    J :=
                               α ◦ c if m ≡ 0 (mod 4) ,
where Lω is left multiplication by the volume element ω = ωm of Cℓm and α|Cℓ0m =
+Id, α|Cℓ1m = −Id.
Proposition 4.11. Let m 6≡ 3 (mod 4). An admissible basis of the Schur algebra
C = C2m+1,0 is given by the endomorphisms Id, I, J and K = IJ of S2m+1,0 = Cℓm .
If m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4), then I 2 = J 2 = −Id, {I, J} = 0 and C2m+1,0 ∼
                                                                    = H. If m ≡ 0

If m ≡ 3 (mod 4), then the Schur algebra C2m+1,0 = R Id and B = Rh.
Proof: straightforward, cf. Proposition 4.6.

          ρ(x̃)s = iα(s)x ,     x ∈ R0,m ⊂ Cℓm = Cℓ0,m ⊗ C , s ∈ S = Cℓm .
As so(0, 2m)-module S = S + + S − is the sum of the two irreducible submodules
S + = Cℓ0m and S − = Cℓ1m , which are inequivalent for m ≡ 2 (mod 4) and equivalent
for m ≡ 3 (mod 4).
   Recall (s. Corollary 4.4) that the standard scalar product on ∧Rm = Cℓm = Cℓm,0
is invariant under left and right multiplications by unit vectors x ∈ Rm = Rm,0 . We
can consider R0,m as subspace
                    R0,m = iRm ⊂ Cℓm = Cℓm ⊗ C = Cℓm + iCℓm .
Then Cℓ0,m = Cℓ00,m + Cℓ10,m = Cℓ0m + iCℓ1m . We define an isomorphism of Z2 -graded
vector spaces ϕ : Cℓm → Cℓ0,m on elements a ∈ Cℓm of pure degree deg(a) = 0 or 1
by:
                                     a 7→ ideg(a) a .
A scalar product < ·, · > on Cℓ0,m is defined by the condition that ϕ : Cℓm → Cℓ0,m
is an isometry for the standard scalar product on ∧Rm = Cℓm . The following lemma
is true by construction.
Lemma 5.3. The scalar product < ·, · > on Cℓ0,m is invariant under left and right
multiplications by unit vectors x ∈ R0,m . In particular, if m ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4),
h = < ·, · > is the (admissible) P in(0, 2m)-invariant scalar product on the irreducible
Cℓ0,2m -module S = S0,2m = Cℓ0,m .
  If m ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4), we extend the scalar product < ·, · > on Cℓ0,m to a sym-
metric complex bilinear form < ·, · >C on S = ∧Cm . Using the operator c = c0,m of
complex conjugation with respect to the real form Cℓ0,m = Cℓ0m + iCℓ1m of Cℓm , we
define a (real) scalar product h = Re < c ·, · >C on S.
Lemma 5.4. Let m ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4). Then h = Re < c ·, · >C is the (admissible)
P in(0, 2m)-invariant scalar product on the irreducible Cℓ0,2m -module S = Cℓm .

  Now we construct (h-)admissible bases of the Schur algebra C = C0,2m for all the
values of m (mod 4).
Proposition 5.5. If m ≡ 0 (mod 4), an admissible basis of the Schur algebra
                               C0,2m ∼
                                     =R⊕R
is given by the endomorphisms Id and E = α of S = Cℓ0,m: τ (E) = −1, σ(E) =
σh (E) = +1, ι(E) = +1.
   If m ≡ 1 (mod 4), an admissible basis of C0,2m ∼ = C is given by the endomorphisms
Id and J = Lω ◦ α of S = Cℓ0,m (where ω is a volume element of Cℓ0,m ): τ (J) = −1,
σ(J) = −1.
   The space B of so(0, 2m)-invariant bilinear forms on S is spanned by the admis-
sible elements h and hE if m ≡ 0 (mod 4) and by h and hJ if m ≡ 1 (mod 4).
Their fundamental invariants (τ, σ, ι) are (τ, σ, ι)(h) = (+1, +1, +1), (τ, σ, ι)(hE ) =
(−1, +1, +1) if m ≡ 0 (mod 4) and (τ, σ)(h) = (+1, +1), (τ, σ)(hJ ) = (−1, −1) if
m ≡ 1 (mod 4).
  If m ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4), we consider the following operators on S = Cℓm :
              I : s 7→ is , J = Lω ◦ c , K = IJ and E = α (ω = ω0,m ) .

Proposition 5.6. Let m ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4). The Schur algebra C0,2m (∼       = H⊕H
if m ≡ 2 (mod 4) and ∼ =  C(2)  if m  ≡   3 (mod  4)) is generated by the admissible
operators I, J and E, which satisfy the following identities:
                        I 2 = J 2 = L2ω = −1 ,    E 2 = c2 = +1 ,

                        {I, J} = [I, E] = [I, Lω ] = {I, c} = 0 ,

                        [J, Lω ] = [J, c] = [E, c] = [Lω , c] = 0 ,

                     [J, E] = [Lω , E] = 0   if m ≡ 2       (mod 4) ,

                    {J, E} = {Lω , E} = 0 if       m ≡ 3 (mod 4) .
An admissible basis of the Schur algebra is given by the endomorphisms Id, I, J, K,
E, EI, EJ, EK. Their fundamental invariants (τ, σ, ι) are given in the next table,
where the value of m is modulo 4.

S0,2m defined in section 5.1. We will extend ρ to an irreducible representation ρ̃
of Cℓ0,2m+1 on S = S0,2m+1 , where S0,2m+1 = S0,2m if m ≡ 0, 2 or 3 (mod 4) and
S0,2m+1 = S0,2m ⊗ C = S2m if m ≡ 1 (mod 4). If m ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4), S0,2m = S2m
admits the Cℓ0,2m -invariant complex structure I. For m ≡ 1 (mod 4) multiplication
by i is a Cℓ0,2m -invariant complex structure on S0,2m ⊗ C and will also be denoted by
I.

Proposition 5.8. The following formulas define an irreducible representation ρ̃ of
Cℓ0,2m+1 on S0,2m+1 .

               ρ̃(e0 ) =
                               I ◦ ρ(ω0,2m )   if m ≡ 1 or    3 (mod 4) ,
where, in the case m ≡ 1 (mod 4), ρ has been extended complex linearly to a repre-
sentation on S0,2m+1 = S0,2m ⊗ C. S = S0,2m+1 is irreducible as Cℓ00,2m+1 -module if
m 6≡ 3 (mod 4) and the sum S = S + + S − of the two equivalent irreducible Cℓ00,2m+1 -

modules S + = S J and S − = iS J if m ≡ 3 (mod 4), where S J is the fixed point set of
a so(0, 2m + 1)-invariant real structure Jˆ on S (the explicit expression for Jˆ will be
given below).
   Next we describe the P in(0, 2m + 1)-invariant scalar product h = h0,2m+1 on S =
S0,2m+1 . Let h0,2m denote the P in(0, 2m)-invariant scalar product on S0,2m+1 =
S0,2m if m ≡ 0, 2 or 3 (mod 4) and by hC0,2m the complex bilinear extension of
the P in(0, 2m)-invariant scalar product on S0,2m to a P in(0, 2m)-invariant complex
bilinear form on S0,2m+1 = S2m = S0,2m ⊗ C if m ≡ 1 (mod 4).
Lemma 5.9. The P in(0, 2m + 1)-invariant scalar product h = h0,2m+1 on S =
S0,2m+1 is given by h = h0,2m if m ≡ 0, 2 or 3 (mod 4) and by h = Re hC0,2m (c ·, ·) if
m ≡ 1 (mod 4), where c is complex conjugation with respect to S0,2m ⊂ S0,2m ⊗ C.
   If m 6≡ 0 (mod 4), we have on S0,2m+1 = Cℓm = Cℓ0,m +iCℓ0,m the operator c = c0,m
of complex conjugation. Using it we define an endomorphism Jˆ of S0,2m+1 = Cℓm by
                                  Jˆ := Lω ◦ α ◦ c ,
where ω = ω0,m is a volume element of Cℓ0,m and α|Cℓ0m = +Id, α|Cℓ1m = −Id.
Proposition 5.10. Let m 6≡ 0 (mod 4). The Schur algebra C = C0,2m+1 is generated
by the endomorphisms I and Jˆ of S = S0,2m+1 = Cℓm , which satisfy the following
relations: I 2 = −1, {I, J}ˆ = 0. Moreover, Jˆ2 = +Id and C0,2m+1 ∼   = R(2) if m ≡ 3

(mod 4) and J = −Id and C0,2m+1 = H if m ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4). An admissible basis
of C0,2m+1 is given by the endomorphisms Id, I, Jˆ and K̂ = I J.  ˆ Their fundamental
invariants (τ, σ, ι) together with the invariants of the associated admissible basis for
the space B of so(0, 2m + 1)-invariant bilinear forms are given in the Table 7 (ι is
only defined if m ≡ 3 (mod 4)). If m ≡ 0 (mod 4), C0,2m+1 = RId.

Theorem 5.11. Every so(0, 2m + 1)-equivariant embedding R0,2m+1 ֒→ (S ⊗ S)∗ is

                          6. Complete classification
   Every pseudo Euclidean space V admits a (unique up to an isometry) orthogonal
decomposition V = V1 + V2 , where V1 = Rm,m and the scalar product of V2 is
positively or negatively defined. Now we consider the case when V1 6= 0 and V2 6= 0,
the other cases were treated in the sections 3.1, 4 and 5. We denote by Si , i = 1, 2,
the irreducible Cℓ(Vi )-module constructed in the sections 3.1 and 4, 5 respectively.
Then S = S1 ⊗ S2 carries the structure of irreducible module for the Clifford algebra
                 ˆ
Cℓ(V ) = Cℓ(V1)⊗Cℓ(V   2 ), s. Proposition 2.4. By Proposition 3.6, to every admissible
bilinear form β2 (respectively endomorphism A2 ) on S2 we associate an admissible
bilinear form β = β1 ⊗ β2 (respectively endomorphism A1 ⊗ A2 ) on S. In the sections
4 and 5 we have contructed admissible bases for the space B2 of so(V2 )-invariant
bilinear forms on S2 and for the Schur algebra C2 of S2 . Therefore, this explicit
correspondence defines an injective linear mapping φ : β2 7→ β = φ(β2 ) (respectively
ψ : A2 7→ A = ψ(A2 )) from B2 into the space B of so(V )-invariant bilinear forms
on S (respectively from C2 into the Schur algebra C of S). Moreover, φ and ψ are
actually isomorphisms, because the Schur algebras of S and S2 are isomorphic, due
to the fact that V and V2 have the same signature s, s. Corollary 1.10. So we have
essentially proved:

Theorem 6.1. There exist natural isomorphisms φ : B2 → B of vector spaces and
ψ : C2 → C of algebras mapping admissible elements onto admissible elements. Under
       N -(SUPER)-EXTENDED POINCARÉ ALGEBRAS AND BILINEAR INVARIANTS                37

these maps, the fundamental invariants of admissible elements transform according
to the rules given in Proposition 2.3.
  In particular, if m ≡ 0 (mod 4), then φ and ψ preserve the fundamental invariants
((4,4)-periodicity).
Proof: We recall that by Proposition 3.4 the Schur algebra Cm,m of S1 = Sm,m
has the admissible basis (Id, E) and E 2 = +Id. This implies that the vector space
isomorphism ψ is actually an isomorphism of algebras. The (4,4)-periodicity follows
from
               σ(fE ) = ι(fE ) = σf (E) = σfE (E) = ι(E) = +1 .
Recall that Bp,q denotes the space of so(p, q)-invariant bilinear forms on the so(p, q)
spinor module Sp,q and Cp,q is the Schur algebra of Sp,q .
Corollary 6.2. ((8,0)- and (0,8)-periodicity) There exist natural isomorphisms
                   φ8,0 : Bp,q → Bp+8,q    and φ0,8 : Bp,q → Bp,q+8
of vector spaces and
                    ψ8,0 : Cp,q → Cp+8,q   and ψ0,8 : Cp,q → Cp,q+8
of algebras mapping the admissible elements onto admissible elements preserving their
fundamental invariants.
Proof: By Theorem 6.1 Bp,q and Cp,q have admissible bases. Now we recall from
sections 4 and 5 that if k ≡ 0 (mod 8), then Ck,0 ∼    = C0,k has an admissible ba-
sis, which was denoted by (Id, E), such that (τ, σ, ι)(E) = (−1, +1, +1) and, of
course, (τ, σ, ι)(Id) = (+1, +1, +1). The existence of the maps ψ8,0 and ψ0,8 follows
from τ (Id)ι(Id) = −τ (E)ι(E). They preserve the fundamental invariants, because
σ(Id) = ι(Id) = σ(E) = ι(E) = +1. The existence and properties of φ8,0 and φ0,8
are proved similarly.
Corollary 6.3. Every so(V )-equivariant mapping j : V → (S ⊗ S)∗ is a linear
combination of the embeddings jA = jρ (hA ), where h is the canonical bilinear form
on the spinor module S of so(V ) and A are admissible elements of the Schur algebra
C of S.
  To obtain an overview over all possible N-extended Poincaré algebras p(V ) + S,
N = ±1, ±2, it is useful to define the invariants σ and ι for embeddings j : V ֒→
(S ⊗ S)∗ having special properties. More precisely, we put σ(j) = +1 if jV ⊂ ∨2 S ∗
and σ(j) = −1 if jV ⊂ ∧2 S ∗ . If S = S + + S − , we define ι(j) = +1 if jV ⊂
(S + ⊗ S + + S − ⊗ S − )∗ and ι(j) = −1 if jV ⊂ (S + ⊗ S − )∗ .
  Note that the fundamental invariants of jA = jρ (hA ), A ∈ C admissible, are easily
computable:
  σ(jA ) = τ (hA )σ(hA ) = τ (h)τ (A)σ(h)σ(A) and ι(jA ) = −ι(hA ) = −ι(h)ι(A) .

 Recall that J denotes the space of so(V )-equivariant mappings j : V → (S ⊗ S)∗ .
We define the subspaces
                       J σ0 := {j ∈ J |σ(j) = σ0 } ∪ {0} and

                         J σ0 ι0 := {j ∈ J σ0 |ι(j) = ι0 } ∪ {0}
and put

We shall write L+ , L+− , ... instead of the more cumbersome L+1 , L+1 −1 , ...
  Remark that L+ (= L++ + L+− if S = S + + S − ) is the maximal number of linearly
independent super algebra structures on p(V ) + S and that L− (= L−+ + L−− ) is the
number of Z2 -graded Lie algebra structures on p(V ) + S.
Theorem 6.4. The numbers (L+ , L− ) and (L++ , L+− , L−+ , L−− ) depend only on the
dimension n = dim V = p + q and the signature s = p − q of V = Rp,q modulo 8.
Moreover, they admit the mirror super symmetry n 7→ −n. More precisely,
                       L+ (−n, s) = L− (n, s) and
                      L+ ι0 (−n, s) = L− ι0 (n, s) , ι0 = ± .
Their values are given in Table 9.

Proof: This follows from Theorem 6.1 and the tables of sections 3.1, 4 and 5 by
straightforward computation.
   In the complex case we consider the space Jc of so(m, C)-equivariant mappings
Cm → (Sm ⊗ Sm )∗ and define the invariants σ, ι and the spaces Jc+ , Jc+− etc. as in

the real case (ι is only defined if the complex so(m, C) spinor module Sm is reducible
Sm = S+       −                                        +
       m + Sm ). Their dimensions are denoted by Lc , Lc

                                                              etc.

                               c , Lc ) and (Lc , Lc , Lc , Lc ) depend only on m
(mod 8). Moreover, they admit the mirror super symmetry m 7→ −m. More precisely,
                            L+          −
                              c (−m) = Lc (m) and
