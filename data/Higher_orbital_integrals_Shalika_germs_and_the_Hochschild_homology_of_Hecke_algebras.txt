                                                Orbital integrals play an important role in the harmonic analysis of a reductive
                                             p–adic group G; they are, for instance, one of the main ingredients in the Arthur–
                                             Selberg trace formula. Orbital integrals on unimodular groups are a particular case
                                             of invariant distribution, which have been used in [2] to prove the irreducibility of
                                             certain induced representations of GLn over a p-adic field.
                                                By definition, an invariant distribution on a unimodular group G gives rise to
                                             a trace (i.e., a Hochschild cocycle of degree zero) on Cc∞ (G), the Hecke algebra of
                                             compactly supported, locally constant, complex valued functions on G. It is inter-
                                             esting then to try to analyse as completely as possible the Hochschild homology and
                                             cohomology groups of the algebra Cc∞ (G) (denoted HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) and HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)),
                                             respectively).
                                                In this paper, G will be the set of F-rational points of a linear algebraic group
                                             G defined over a finite extension F of the field Qp of p-adic numbers, p being a
                                             fixed prime number. The group G does not have to be reductive, although this is

certainly the most interesting case. When we shall assume G (or G, by abuse of
language) to be reductive, we shall state this explicitely. For us, the most important
topology to consider on G will be the locally compact topology induced from an
embedding of G ⊂ GLn (F). Nevertheless, the Zariski topology on G will also play
a role in our study.
   To state the main result of this paper, we need to introduce first the concept of
standard subgroup. For any set A ⊂ G, we shall denote
                        C(A) := {g ∈ G, ga = ag, ∀a ∈ A}
and Z(A) := A ∩ C(A). This latter notation will be used only when A is a sub-
group of G. A commutative subgroup S of G is called standard if S = Z(C(s))
for some semi-simple element s ∈ G. Our results will be stated in terms of stan-
dard subgroups of G. We shall denote by Hu the set of unipotent elements of a
subgroup H. Sometimes, the set C(S)u is also denoted by US , in order to avoid
having to many paranthesis in our formulae. One of the main results of this paper
(Theorem 1) identifies the groups HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) in terms of the following data: the
set Σ of (conjugacy classes of) standard subgroups S of G, the subset S reg ⊂ S of
S-regular elements, the action of the Weyl group W (S) of S on Cc∞ (S), and the
continuous cohomology of the C(S)–module
                         Cc∞ (US )δ := Cc∞ (C(S)u ) ⊗ ∆C(S) ,
where ∆C(S) denotes the modular function of the group C(S). More precisely, if G
is a p-adic group defined over a field of characteristic zero, as before, then Theorem
1 states the existence of an isomorphism
                              M
(1)           HHq (Cc∞ (G)) ≃      Cc∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗ Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ),
                             S∈Σ
which can be made natural by using a generalization of the Shalika germs.
   It is important to relate this result with the periodic cyclic homology groups of
Cc∞ (G). For the Hecke algebra Cc∞ (G), the periodic cyclic homology is related to
Hochschild homology by
(2)                 HPq (Cc∞ (G)) ≃ ⊕k∈Z HHq+2k (Cc∞ (G))comp ,
that is, HP∗ (Cc∞ (G)) is the localization of Hochschild homology to the G-invariant
subset of compact elements of G. This relation is implicit in [10]. Consequently, the
results of this paper complement the results on the cyclic homology of p–adic groups
in [10, 19]. It is interesting to remark that HP∗ (Cc∞ (G)) can also be described
in terms of the admissible spectrum of G, see [12], and hence our results have
significance for the representation theory of p-adic groups. See also [16] for similar
results on (the groups of real points of) algebraic groups defined over R. These
periodic cyclic cohomology groups are isomorphic to K∗ (Cr∗ (G)), by combining
results from [1], [13], and [10].
   Assume for the moment that G is reductive. Then, in order to better understand
the role played by the groups HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) and H∗ (G, Cc∞ (Gu )) in the representa-
tion theory of G, we relate H∗ (G, Cc∞ (Gu )) to the analogous cohomology groups,
H∗ (P, Cc∞ (Pu )δ ) and H∗ (M, Cc∞ (Mu )δ ), associated to parabolic subgroups P of G
and to their Levi components M . In particular, we define morphisms between
these Hochschild homology groups that are analogous to the induction and infla-
tion morphisms that play such a prominent role in the representation theory of
p–adic groups. These morphisms are induced by morphisms of algebras.

   In [4], Blanc and Brylinski have introduced higher orbital integrals associated to
regular semisimple elements by proving first that
(3)                       HHq (Cc∞ (G)) ≃ Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ),
a result which they dubed “the MacLane isomorphism.” (Actually, they did not
have to twist with the modular function, because they worked only with unimodular
groups G, see Lemma 1 for the slightly more general version needed in this paper),
after that we rely more on filtrations of the G-module Cc∞ (G), rather than on
localization. This allows us to define higher orbital integrals at arbitrary elements.
Then, we study the properties of these orbital integrals and we obtain in particular
a proof of the existence of abstract Shalika germs for the higher orbital integrals.
Actually, the existence of Shalika germs turns out to be a consequence of some
general homological properties of the ring of invariant, locally constant functions
on the group G. We also use the techniques developed in [16] in the framework of
real algebraic groups. It would be interesting to relate the results of this paper to
those of [11].
   This is the revised version of an preprint that was first circulated in February
1999. I would like to thank Paul Baum, David Kazhdan, Robert Langlands, George
Lusztig, Roger Plymen, and Peter Schneider for useful comments and discussions.

                       1. Homology of Hecke algebras
   In this section we shall use several general results on Hochschild homology of
algebras, on algebraic groups, and on the continuous cohomology of totally discon-
nected groups. Good references are [5, 6, 15], for the general theory, and [12] for
questions related to Hochschild homology.
   If G is a group and A ⊂ G is a subset, we denote by C(A) the centralizer of A,
that is, the set of elements of G that commute with every element of A, and by
N (A) the normalizer of A, that is, the set of elements g ∈ G such that gAg −1 = A.
By Z = Z(G) = C(G) we denote the center of G.
   If X is a totally disconnected, locally compact, non-discrete space X, we denote
by Cc∞ (X) the space of compactly supported, locally constant, complex valued
functions on X. Recall that, if U ⊂ X is an open subset of X as above, then
restriction defines an isomorphism
(4)                        Cc∞ (X)/Cc∞ (U ) ≃ Cc∞ (X \ U ).
   Let G be a linear algebraic group defined over a totally disconnected locally
compact field F. Thus F is a finite algebraic extension of Qp , the field of p-adic
numbers. The set G(F) of F-rational points of G is called a p–adic group and will
be denoted simply by G. It is known [5] that G = G(F) identifies with a closed
subgroup of GLn (F), and hence it has a natural locally compact topology that
makes it a totally disconnected space. We fix a Haar measure dg on G.
   Consider now the space Cc∞ (G) of compactly supported, locally constant func-
tions on G. Fix a Haar measure dh on G. Then the convolution product, denoted
∗, is defined by
                                       Z
                         f1 ∗ f2 (g) =   f1 (h)f2 (h−1 g)dh,
                                        G
makes Cc∞ (G) an algebra, the Hecke algebra of G. It is important in representa-
tion theory to determine the (AdG –)invariant linear functionals on Cc∞ (G). If G is

unimodular, the space of invariant linear functionals on Cc∞ (G) coincides with the
space of traces on Cc∞ (G); moreover, since the space of traces of Cc∞ (G) identifies
with HH0 (Cc∞ (G)), the first Hochschild cohomology group of Cc∞ (G), it is reason-
able to ask what are the groups HHq (Cc∞ (G)), the Hochschild homology groups of
Cc∞ (G), in general. Since HHq (Cc∞ (G)) is the algebraic dual of HHq (Cc∞ (G)), it is
enough to concentrate on Hochschild homology. The computation of the groups
HHq (Cc∞ (G)) is the main purpose of this paper.
   We first recall the definition of HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)). Let

                       Cc∞ (Gq+1 ) = Cc∞ (G) ⊗ Cc∞ (G) ⊗ . . . ⊗ Cc∞ (G),

(q + 1)–times, be the usual (algebraic) tensor product of vector spaces. The Hoch-
schild differential b : Cc∞ (Gq+2 ) → Cc∞ (Gq+1 ) is given by
                                     q
                                     X               Z
                                                 j
(5) (bf )(g0 , g1 , . . . , gq ) =         (−1)           f (g0 , . . . , gj−1 , γ, γ −1 gj , gj+1 , . . . , gq )dγ
                                     j=0              G
                                                                            Z
                                                                      q+1
                                                            + (−1)               f (γ −1 g0 , g1 , . . . , gq , γ)dγ.
                                                                             G

By definition, the q-th Hochschild homology group of Cc∞ (G), denoted HHq (Cc∞ (G)),
is the q-th homology group of the complex (Cc∞ (Gq+1 ), b). Since Cc∞ (G) is an
inductive limit of unital algebras, this definition coincides with the usual definition
of Hochschild homology for non-unital algebras (using algebras with adjoint unit).
   The group G acts by conjugation on Cc∞ (G), and we denote by Cc∞ (G)ad the
G-module defined by this action. Also, let ∆G denote the modular function of G,
which we recall, is defined by the relation
                                  Z               Z
                           ∆G (h)     f (gh)dg =     f (g)dg.
                                             G                       G

We shall be especially interested in the G–module Cc∞ (G)δ obtained from Cc∞ (G)ad
by twisting it with the modular function. More precisely, let Cc∞ (G)δ = Cc∞ (G) as
vector spaces, and let the action of G on functions be given by the formula

(6)                    (γ · f )(g) = ∆G (γ)f (γ −1 gγ),                     f ∈ Cc∞ (G)δ .

The reason for this twisting is that, for G non-unimodular, the traces of Cc∞ (G) are
the G–invariant functionals on Cc∞ (G)δ , not on Cc∞ (G) (this is an immediate con-
sequence of Lemma 1). More generally, our approach to the Hochschild homology
of Cc∞ (G) is based on Lemma 1.
   Before stating and proving Lemma 1, we need to introduce some notation. First,
if M is an arbitrary G–module, we denote by M ⊗ ∆G the tensor product of the
G–modules M and C, where the action on C is given by the multiplication with
the modular function of G. (We sometimes write this as Cc∞ (G)δ = Cc∞ (G) ⊗ ∆G .)
   If M is a right G–module and M ′ is a left G–module, then M ⊗G M ′ is defined
as the quotient of M ⊗ M ′ by the submodule generated by mg ⊗ m′ − m ⊗ gm′. For
example, if H ⊂ G is a closed subgroup and if X is a left H–space, then we have
an isomorphism of G–spaces

(7)                     Cc∞ (G) ⊗H (Cc∞ (X) ⊗ ∆H ) ≃ Cc∞ (G ×H X),

where G × X is the quotient (G × X)/H for the action h(g, x) = (gh−1 , hx). This
isomorphism is obtained by observing that the natural map
  tX : Cc∞ (G) ⊗ Cc∞ (X) = Cc∞ (G × X) −→ Cc∞ (G ×H X),
                                                                              Z
                                                          tX (f )((g, x)) =        f (gh, h−1 x)dh,
                                                                               H
passes to the quotient to give the desired isomorphism. Sometimes it will be con-
venient to regard a left G–module as a right G–module by replacing g with g −1 .
   Also, recall that a G–module M is smooth if, and only if, the stabilizer of each
element of M is open in G. Then one can define the continuous homology groups
of G with coefficients in the smooth module M , denoted Hk (G, M ), using tensor
products as follows. Let Bq (G) = Cc∞ (Gq+1 ), q = 0, 1, . . . , be the Bar complex of
the group G, with differential
                                        q+1
                                        X         Z
                                                j
         (df )(g0 , g1 , . . . , gq ) =     (−1)    f (g0 , . . . , gj−1 , γ, gj , . . . , gq )dγ.
                                      j=0          G

Then the complex (Bq , d) gives a resolution of C with projective Cc∞ (G)–modules,
and the complex
(8)                                         Bq (G) ⊗G M
computes Hq (G, M ). See [3, 6].
  We shall need the following extension of a result from [4]:
Lemma 1. Let Cc∞ (G)δ = Cc∞ (G) ⊗ ∆G be the G–module obtained by twisting the
adjoint action of G on Cc∞ (G) by the modular function. Then we have a natural
isomorphism
(9)                             HHq (Cc∞ (G)) ≃ Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ).
Proof. Consider the complex (8), which computes the continuous cohomology of
M = Cc∞ (G)δ , and let hG : Bq (G) ⊗ Cc∞ (G)δ ≃ Cc∞ (G) ⊗ Cc∞ (Gq+1 ) = Cc∞ (Gq+2 ) →
Cc∞ (G)⊗q+1 be the map
                                    Z
   hG (f )(g0 , g1 , . . . , gq ) =   f (g −1 hg, g −1 g0 , g −1 g0 g1 , . . . , g −1 g0 g1 . . . gq )dg,
                                  G
                                                                                   h = g0 g1 . . . gq .
  As in equation (7), the map hG descends to the quotient to induce an isomor-
phism
(10)            h̃G : Bq (G) ⊗G Cc∞ (G)δ ≃ Cc∞ (Gq+2 ) ⊗G C ≃ Cc∞ (G)⊗q+1
of complexes, that is h̃G ◦ (d ⊗G 1) = b ◦ h̃G , which establishes the isomorphism
Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ) ≃ HHq (Cc∞ (G)), as desired.
   To better justify the twisting of the module Cc∞ (G) by the modular function in
the above lemma, note that the trivial representation    of G gives rise to an obvious
morphism π0 : Cc∞ (G) → C, by π0 (f ) = G f (g)dg, which hence defines a trace on
                                          R

Cc∞ (G). However π0 is not G–invariant for the usual action of G, but is invariant
if we twist the adjoint action of G by the modular function, as indicated.
   We proceed now to a detailed study of the G-module Cc∞ (G)δ . First we define a
natural AdG -invariant stratification of G, called the standard stratification of G.

    Let g be the Lie algebra of G in the sense of linear algebraic groups. Denote by
ai (g) the coefficients of the polynomial det(t + 1 − Adg ),
                                              m
                                              X
                        det(t + 1 − Adg ) =         ai (g)ti ∈ F[t].
                                              i=0

Let ar be the first non-zero coefficient ai , and define
                       Vk = {ar = ar+1 = . . . = ar+k−1 = 0}.
Thus V0 = G, by convention, and G \ V1 = G′ , the set of regular elements of G if
G is reductive. Also, Vm+1 = ∅ because am = 1. We observe that the functions
ai (g) are G-invariant polynomial functions on G, and that they depend only on the
semisimple part of g.
    The description of the Hochschild homology of Cc∞ (G) that we shall obtain is
formulated in terms of certain commutative subgroups of G, called standard, that
we now define.
Definition 1. A commutative subgroup S ⊂ G is called standard if, and only if,
there exists a semisimple element s0 ∈ G such that S is the center of C(s0 ), the
centralizer of s0 in G.
    If s0 and S are as in the definition above, then S is the set of F–rational points of
a subgroup S of G and C(S) = C(s0 ). The element s0 in the above definition is not
unique in general, and, for a standard subgroup S ⊂ G, we denote by S reg ⊂ S the
set of semisimple elements s ∈ S such that C(S) = C(s). An element s ∈ S reg will
be called S-regular. This set is not empty by the definition of a standard subgroup.
Note that S reg depends on G also, and not only on S.
    Standard subgroups exist. Indeed, if γ ∈ G is semisimple, then S(γ) := Z(C(γ)),
the center of the centralizer of γ, is a standard subgroup of G. In particular, every
semisimple element of G belongs to S reg , for some standard subgroup S of G. For
all standard subgroups S, the set S reg is an open subset of S in the Zariski topology.
    For any p–adic group H, we denote by Hu the set of unipotent elements of H,
and call it the unipotent variety of H. In the particular case of H = C(S), where
S ⊂ G is a standard subgroup, we also denote C(S)u = US .
    In order to proceed further, recall that the Jordan decomposition of an element
g ∈ G is g = gs gu , where gs is semisimple, gu is unipotent, and gs gu = gu gs . This
decomposition is unique [5]. If g = gs gu is the Jordan decomposition of g ∈ G and
if gs ∈ S reg , then gu ∈ US , by definition, and hence g ∈ S reg US .
    Consider now a standard subgroup S ⊂ G and let
                                FS = AdG (S reg ), and
                                 FSu = AdG (S reg US )
be the set of semisimple elements of G conjugated to an element of S reg and,
respectively, the set of elements g ∈ G conjugated to an element of S reg US (i.e.,
such that the semisimple part of g is in FS ). Also, let N (S) be the normalizer of
S and W (S) = N (S)/C(S). Since N (S) leaves S reg invariant and is actually the
normalizer of this set, it follows that the quotient W (S) can be identified with a set
of automorphisms of Sss , the subgroup of semisimple elements of S. Since N (S)
is the set of F–rational points of an algebraic group, the rigidity of tori ([5], page
117) shows that W (S) is finite.

   The natural map (g, s) → gsg −1 descends to a map
                    φS : (G × S reg )/N (S) ∋ (g, s) → gsg −1 ∈ FS .
Similarly, we obtain a map
                 φuS : (G × S reg US )/N (S) ∋ (g, su) → gsug −1 ∈ FSu .
   In the following proposition we consider the locally compact (and Hausdorff)
topology of G, and not the Zariski topology. Denote by Gss the set of semisimple
elements of G.
Proposition 1. Let S be a standard subgroup of G. Using the above notation, we
have:
   (i) The set FS is an analytic submanifold of G, and the maps φS and φuS are
homeomorphisms.
   (ii) For each k, the set Vk \ Vk+1 is a disjoint union of sets of the form FSu , and
each FSu ⊂ Vk \ Vk+1 is an open subset of Vk . Moreover, the set Gss ∩ (Vk \ Vk+1 ) is
a disjoint union of sets of the form FS , and each FS ⊂ Vk \ Vk+1 is an open subset
of Gss ∩ Vk .
Proof. (i) First we check that φS and φuS are injective. Indeed, assume that
g1 s1 g1−1 = g2 s2 g2−1 , for some s1 , s2 ∈ S reg . Then, if g = g2−1 g1 , we have
              gC(s1 )g −1 = C(s2 ) ⇒ gC(S)g −1 = C(S) ⇒ gSg −1 = S,
and hence g ∈ N (S). Consequently, we have (g1 , s1 ) = (g2 g, g −1 s2 g) = g −1 (g2 , s2 ),
with g ∈ N (S), as desired. The same argument shows that if FS and FS ′ have a
point in common, then the standard subgroups S and S ′ are conjugated in G.
    The injectivity of φuS follows from the injectivity of φS , indeed, if g1 (s1 u1 )g1−1 =
g2 (s2 u2 )g2−1 , let g = g2−1 g1 as above, and conclude that gs1 g −1 = s2 , by the
uniqueness of the Jordan decomposition. As above, this implies that g ∈ N (S).
    Since the differential dφS is a linear isomorphism onto its image (i.e. it is injec-
tive) and φS is injective, it follows that φS is a local homeomorphism onto its image
(for the locally compact topologies), and that its image is an analytic submanifold
([21], p. 38, Theorem (2.3)). The set Gss ∩ (Vk \ Vk+1 ) is an algebraic variety on
which G acts with orbits of the same dimension, and hence φS is proper. This
proves that φS is a homeomorphism. Using an inverse for φS , we obtain that φuS is
also a homeomorphism.
    To prove now (ii), consider a standard subgroup S ⊂ G, and let d be the dimen-
sion of C(S). Then a0 = a1 = . . . = ad−1 = 0 on S, and S ∩ {ad 6= 0} contains
S reg as an open component. It follows that, if s ∈ Gss ∩ (Vk \ Vk+1 ) ∩ S reg , then
FS ⊂ Vk \ Vk+1 . This shows that Gss ∩ (Vk \ Vk+1 ) is a union of sets of the form FS .
This must then be a disjoint union because the sets FS are either equal or disjoint,
as proved above.
    Now, if g ∈ Vk \ Vk+1 has semisimple part s, then s ∈ FS ⊂ Gs ∩ (Vk \ Vk+1 ),
for some standard subgroup S, and hence g ∈ FSu ⊂ Vk \ Vk+1 . The sets FSu are
open in the induced topology because the map Vk \ Vk+1 → Gs ∩ (Vk \ Vk+1 ) is
continuous.

   See also [24].
   Let R∞ := R∞ (G) be the ring of locally constant AdG -invariant functions on G
with the pointwise product, which we regard as a subset of the set of endomorphisms

of the G–module Cc∞ (G)δ = Cc∞ (G) ⊗ ∆G . For each k ≥ 1, denote by Ik ⊂ R∞ the
ideal generated by functions f : G → C of the form
                               f = φ(ar , ar+1 , . . . , ar+k−1 ),
where φ is a locally constant function φ : Fk → C such that φ(0, 0, . . . , 0) =
0. (Recall that each of the polynomials a0 , . . . , ar−1 is the 0 polynomial.) By
convention, we set I0 = (0); also, it follows that Im+1 = R∞ .
  Fix now k, and let pn ∈ Ik be the function φn (ar , ar+1 , . . . , ar+k−1 ), where
φn : Fk → C is 1 on the set
                        {ξ = (ξ0 , . . . , ξk−1 ) ∈ Fk , max |ξi | ≥ q −n }
and vanishes outside this set. (Here q is the number of elements of the residual
field of F, and the non-archimedean norm “| |” is normalized such that its range is
{0}∪{q n , n ∈ Z}.) Then pn = p2n = pn pn+1 and Ik = ∪pn R∞ . For further reference,
we state as a lemma a basic property of the constructions we have introduced.
Lemma 2. If M is a R∞ –module, then Ik M = ∪pn M .

    As a consequence of this above lemma, we obtain the following result.
Corollary 1. Consider the G–module
               Mk = (Ik+1 /Ik ) ⊗R∞ Cc∞ (G)δ ≃ Ik+1 Cc∞ (G)δ /Ik Cc∞ (G)δ .
Then, for each q ≥ 0, we have an isomorphism
                                                   m
                                                   M
                             Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ) ≃         Hq (G, Mk )
                                                   k=0

of vector spaces.
Proof. There exists a (not natural) isomorphism
                                  m
                                  M
            Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ) ≃         Ik+1 Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ )/Ik Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ),
                                  k=0

of vector spaces.
   By the above lemma, the inclusion of Ik Cc∞ (G)δ → Cc∞ (G)δ of G-modules induces
natural isomorphisms

    Hq (G, Ik Cc∞ (G)δ ) ≃ Hq (G, lim pn Cc∞ (G)δ )
                                   →
                                         ≃ lim pn Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ) ≃ Ik Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ),
                                             →

because the functor Hq is compatible with inductive limits and with direct sums.
  The naturality of these isomorphisms and the Five Lemma show that
      Hq (G, Ik+1 Cc∞ (G)δ /Ik Cc∞ (G)δ ) ≃ Ik+1 Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ )/Ik Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ).
This is enough to complete the proof.

   We now study the homology of the subquotients Mk = Ik+1 Cc∞ (G)δ /Ik Cc∞ (G)δ
by identifying them with induced modules. Let Σk be a set of representative of con-
jugacy classes of standard subgroups S such that FS ⊂ Vk \ Vk+1 (or, equivalently,
FSu ⊂ Vk \ Vk+1 ).

Lemma 3. Using the above notation, we have Ik Cc∞ (G) = Cc∞ (G \ Vk ) and
                                              M
                 Ik+1 Cc∞ (G)δ /Ik Cc∞ (G)δ ≃    Cc∞ (FSu ).
                                                      S∈Σk

Proof. It follows from the definition of Ik that, if f ∈ Ik Cc∞ (G)δ , then f vanishes
in a neighborhood of Vk . Conversely, if f is in Cc∞ (G \ Vk ), then we can find some
polynomial ai , with i ≤ r + k − 1, such that |ai | is bounded from below on the
support of f by, say, q −n , then pn f = f . The second isomorphism follows from the
first isomorphism using (4) and Lemma 2.

   If H ⊂ G is a closed subgroup and M is a smooth (left) H–module (that is, the
stabilizer of each m ∈ M is an open subgroup of M ), we denote
(11)    indG         ∞             ∞
           H (M ) = Cc (G) ⊗H M = Cc (G) ⊗ M/{f h ⊗ m − f ⊗ hm, h ∈ H}.

Where the right H–module structure on Cc∞ (G) is (f h)(g) = f (gh−1 ). Then
Shapiro’s lemma, see [7], states that
(12)                     Hk (G, indG
                                   H (M ) ⊗ ∆G ) ≃ Hk (H, M ).

(A proof of Shapiro’s Lemma in our setting is contained in the proof of Theorem
4.)
    The basic examples of induced modules are obtained from H–spaces. If X is an
H–space (we agree that H acts on X from the left), then
            Cc∞ ((G × X)/H) ≃ indG   ∞                 G   ∞
                                 H (Cc (X) ⊗ ∆H ) ≃ indH (Cc (X)δ )

as G–modules, where H acts on G × X by h(g, x) = (gh−1 , hx). For example,
Proposition 1 identifies Cc∞ (FSu ) with an induced module:
       Cc∞ (FSu ) ≃ indG       ∞
                       N (S) (Cc (S
                                    reg
                                        US ) ⊗ ∆N (S) ) = indG       ∞
                                                             N (S) (Cc (S
                                                                          reg
                                                                              US )δ ).
   Shapiro’s lemma is an easy consequence of the Serre–Hochschild spectral se-
quence, see [7], which states the following. Let M be a smooth G–module and
H ⊂ G be a normal subgroup. Then the action of G on Hq (H, M ) descends to an ac-
                                                        2
tion of G/H, and there exists a spectral sequence with Ep,q = Hp (G/H, Hq (H, M )),
convergent to Hp+q (G, M ).
   Let Mk = Ik+1 Cc∞ (G)δ /Ik Cc∞ (G)δ , as before.
Proposition 2. Using the above notation, we have a natural
                         M
           Hq (G, Mk ) ≃      Cc∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗ Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ )
                             hSi∈Σk
                   ∞
isomorphism of R –modules
Proof. Let S be a standard subgroup of G. Recall first that W (S) = N (S)/C(S) is
a finite group that acts freely on S reg , which gives a N (S)–equivariant isomorphism
                        Cc∞ (S reg US )δ = Cc∞ (US )δ ⊗ Cc∞ (S reg ).
   Let M be a smooth N (S)–module. The Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence
applied to the module M and the normal subgroup C(S) ⊂ N (S) gives natural
isomorphisms
          Hq (N (S), M ) ≃ H0 (W (S), Hq (C(S), M )) ≃ Hq (C(S), M )W (S) .
10                                       V. NISTOR


     Combining these two isomorphisms, we obtain

 Hk (G, Cc∞ (FSu )δ ) ≃ Hk (G, indG       ∞
                                  N (S) (Cc (S
                                               reg
                                                   US )δ )δ ) ≃ Hk (N (S), Cc∞ (S reg US )δ )
                                        W (S)
≃ Hk (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ )⊗Cc∞ (S reg )         ≃ Cc∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗Hk (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ).
                                      

The result then follows from Lemma 3, which implies directly that
                                  Mk ≃ ⊕S∈Σk Cc∞ (FSu )δ .
The proof is now complete.

   Combining this proposition with Corollary 1, we obtain the main result of this
section. Recall that a p–adic group G = G(F) is the set of F–rational points of
a linear algebraic group G defined over a non-archemedean, non-discrete, locally
compact field F of characteristic zero. Also, recall that US is the set of unipotent
elements commuting with the standard subgroup S, and that the action of C(S) on
Cc∞ (US ) is twisted by the modular function of C(S), yielding the module Cc∞ (US )δ =
Cc∞ (US ) ⊗ ∆C(S) .
Theorem 1. Let G be a p–adic group. Let Σ be a set of representative of conjugacy
classes of standard subgroups of S ⊂ G and W (S) = N (S)/C(S), then we have an
isomorphism
                              M
              HHq (Cc∞ (G)) ≃    Cc∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗ Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ).
                                S∈Σ

  Remark. The isomorphism of the above theorem is not natural. A more natural
description of HHq (Cc∞ (G)) will be obtained in one of the following sections by
considering higher orbital integrals and their Shalika germs

            2. Higher orbital integrals and their Shalika germs
   Proposition 2 of the previous section allows us to determine the structure of the
localized cohomology groups HH∗ (Cc∞ (G))m , where m is a maximal ideal of R∞ (G).
This will lead to an extension of the higher orbital integrals introduced by Blanc
and Brylinski in [4], and to a generalization of some results of Shalika [22] to higher
orbital integrals. In this way, we shall also obtain a more natural description of
HHq (Cc∞ (G)).
   First recall the following result.
Proposition 3. Let G be a reductive p–adic group over a field of characteristic 0,
S ⊂ G be a standard subgroup, and γ ∈ S reg (that is, γ is a semisimple element
such that C(S) = C(γ)). Then there exists a N (S)–invariant closed and open
neighborhood of γ in C(S) such that
                              G × U ∈ (g, h) → ghg −1 ∈ G
defines a homeomorphism of (G × U )/N (S) onto a G–invariant, closed and open
subset V ⊂ G containing γ.
Proof. The result follows from Luna’s Lemma. For p-adic groups, Luna’s Lemma
is proved in [17], page 109, Properties “C” and “D.”

     From this proposition we obtain the following consequences for the ring R∞ (G).
                           HOMOLOGY OF p-ADIC GROUPS                                      11


Corollary 2. Let U and V be as in Proposition 3 above.
   (i) The ring R∞ (G) decomposes as the direct sum C ∞ (V )G ⊕ C ∞ (V c )G , and
C (V )G ≃ C ∞ (U )N (S) ⊂ C ∞ (C(S))N (S) = R∞ (C(S))W (S) . (Here V c is the com-
 ∞

plement of V in G.)
   (ii) For any two semisimple elements γ, γ ′ ∈ G, if φ(γ) = φ(γ ′ ) for all φ ∈
R (G), then γ and γ ′ are conjugated in G.
  ∞

   (iii) Let m ∈ R∞ (G) be the maximal ideal consisting of functions that vanish
at a semisimple element γ ∈ G. Then p is generated by an increasing sequence of
projections, and Mm ≃ M/mM , for any R∞ (G)–module M .
Proof. (i) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 3. (ii) follows from [17],
Proposition 2.5.
   To prove (iii), observe that the maximal ideal m is generated by a sequence of
projections pn , that is, m = ∪pn R∞ (G), with p2n = pn .
   We know from [17], Proposition 2.5, that R∞ (G) is isomorphic to C ∞ , for some
locally compact, totally disconnected topological space X. Moreover, if M is a
C ∞ (X)–module and m is the maximal ideal of functions vanishing at x0 , for some
fixed point x0 ∈ X, then C ∞ (X)m ≃ C ∞ (X)/mC ∞ (X), and hence
      Mm = M ⊗C ∞ (X) C ∞ (X)m ≃ M ⊗C ∞ (X) C ∞ (X)/mC ∞ (X) ≃ M/mM.
Since X is metrizable, we can choose a basis Vn of compact open neighborhoods
of x0 in X. Then, if we let pn to be the characteristic function of Vnc , then pn are
projections generating m. By choosing Vn to be decreasing, we obtain a decreasing
sequence pn .
  We now consider for each maximal ideal m ⊂ R∞ = R∞ (G) the localization
HHq (Cc∞ (G))m .
Proposition 4. Let m be a maximal ideal of R∞ (G). If m consists of the functions
that vanish at the semisimple element γ ∈ G and S ⊂ G is a standard subgroup
such that γ ∈ S reg , then
                       HHq (Cc∞ (G))m ≃ Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ).
For all other maximal ideals m ⊂ R∞ (G), we have HHq (Cc∞ (G))m = 0.
  Note that Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )) ≃ Hq (C(γ), Cc∞ (C(γ)u )).
Proof. The vanishing of HH∗ (Cc∞ (G))m in the second half of the proposition follows
because Cc∞ (G)m = 0 in that case.
   Assume now that m consists of functions vanishing at γ, a semisimple element
of G. The localization functor V → Vm is exact by standard homological algebra.
The sequence of ideals (Ik )m is an increasing sequence satisfying (I0 )m ≃ 0 and
(Im+1 )m ≃ C. Choose k such that (Ik )m ≃ 0 and (Ik+1 )m ≃ C. (This happens if,
and only if, γ ∈ Vk \ Vk+1 .) It follows that
               Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ )m ≃ Hq (G, Ik+1 Cc∞ (G)δ /Ik Cc∞ (G)δ )m .
   Since all the isomorphisms of Proposition 2 are compatible with this the local-
ization functor, we obtain that

The only quotient Cc∞ (S reg )W (S) /mCc∞ (S reg )W (S) that does not vanish is the one
containing (a conjugate of) γ, and then it is isomorphic to C. This completes the
proof.

     An alternative proof can be obtained by writing
          Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ )m ≃ Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δm ) ≃ Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ /mCc∞ (G)δ ),
and then observing that Cc∞ (G)δ /mCc∞ (G)δ ≃ Cc∞ (US ), by Corollary 2 (iii). How-
ever the above proof is more convenient when dealing with orbital integrals. See
also [16], first circulated in 1990 as a preprint of the Mathematical Institute of the
Romanian Academy (INCREST) Nr. 18, March 1990, and where the localization
techniques were first introduced.
   We now extend the definition of higher orbital integrals introduced by Blanc and
Brylinski to cover non–regular semisimple elements also. Fix a standard subgroup
S ⊂ G, and let k be such that S reg ⊂ Vk \ Vk+1 . As in the above proof, Proposition
2 gives a natural R∞ (G)–linear, degree preserving, surjective morphism

       H∗ (G, Ik+1 Cc∞ (G)δ /Ik Cc∞ (G)δ ) −→ Cc∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ),
and hence a linear map
(13)
Ik+1 HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) = H∗ (G, Ik+1 Cc∞ (G)δ ) −→ Cc∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ).

     Fix c ∈ Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ) and γ ∈ S reg , and let
                                  S
                          Oγ,c = Oγ,c : Ik+1 HHq (Cc∞ (G)) −→ C
be the evaluation of the map at γ and c in (13). We obtain, in particular, that
for any f ∈ Ik+1 HHq (Cc∞ (G)), the function γ → Oγ,c (f ) is a locally constant,
compactly supported function on S reg . The function Oγ,c can then be extended to
the whole group HHq (Cc∞ (G)) using a simple observation. For any γ ∈ S reg there
exists a locally constant function φ ∈ Ik+1 such that φ(γ) = 1. Then let
                                    Oγ,c (f ) := Oγ,c (φf ),
which is independent of φ. It follows from definition of Oγ,c that, for any f ∈
HHq (Cc∞ (G)), the function γ → Oγ,c (f ), obtained as above, is a locally constant
function on S reg , but not necessarily compactly supported. We thus obtain the
following result.
Proposition 5. Let S ⊂ G be a standard subgroup. Then there exists a degree-
preserving, R∞ (G)–linear map

              OS : HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) −→ C ∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ),
which is an isomorphism when localized at each maximal ideal m ⊂ R∞ (G) consist-
ing of functions vanishing at an element γ ∈ S reg .
  We call the maps OS and Oγ,c = Oγ,c     S
                                             “higher orbital integrals” because they
generalize the usual notion of orbital integral. (If c is a cocycle of dimension q,
we call Oγ,c a q-higher orbital integral.) Indeed, assume that G and C(S) are uni-
modular, following thorough the identifications in the previous section, we obtain,
                             HOMOLOGY OF p-ADIC GROUPS                                 13


for c0 = 1 ∈ H0 (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ) the evaluation at the identity element e ∈ G, and
f ∈ Cc∞ (G) = HH0 (Cc∞ (G)), that
                                             Z
                    Oγ,c0 (f ) = Oγ,1 (f ) =         f (gγg −1 )dg,
                                               G/C(S)

where dg is the induced measure on G/C(S).
  If γ ∈ G is a semisimple element and S is a standard subgroup of G such that
C(γ) = C(S), (i.e., γ ∈ S reg ), then restriction at γ defines a map
                  Oγ = OγS : HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) → H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ )
such that c(Oγ (f )) = Oγ,c (f ), for all c ∈ Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ).
                                                   S
   A word on notation, whenever we write Oγ,c         or OγS , we assume that γ ∈ S reg ,
which actually determines S. This means that we can omit S from notation. How-
                                            S
ever, if we want to write that Oγ,c = Oγ,c     is obtained by specializing
             OS : HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) → C ∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ )
to a point γ ∈ S reg and then by evaluating at c, that is that
                                S
                               Oγ,c (f ) = hOS (f )(γ), ci,
then it is obviously more convenient to include S in the notation.
   Let γ ∈ G be a semisimple element. We want now to investigate the behavior
of the orbital integrals Og,c with g in a small neighborhood of γ. Fix a standard
subgroup S ⊂ G such that γ is in the closure of AdG (S reg ), but is not in AdG (S reg ),
and a class c ∈ Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )). More precisely, we want to study the germ of
the function g → Og,c (f ) at an element γ, where f ∈ HHq (Cc∞ (G)) is arbitrary.
The germ of a function h at γ will be denoted hγ .
   The following theorem extends one of the basic properties of Shalika germs from
usual orbital integrals to higher orbital integrals.
Theorem 2. Let S ∈ G be a standard subgroup γ ∈ S an element in the closure of
S reg , but γ 6∈ S reg . Then there exists a degree preserving linear map
       σγS : H∗ (C(γ), Cc∞ (C(γ)u )δ ) → C ∞ (S reg )W
                                                     γ
                                                       (S)
                                                           ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ),
such that
                                 OS (f )γ = σγS (Oγ (f )),
for all f ∈ HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)).
  Note that, in the notation for the maps σγS , the standard subgroup S is no longer
determined by γ.
Proof. By the definition of the localization of a module, the map
             OS : HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) → C ∞ (S reg )W
                                              γ
                                                (S)
                                                    ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ )
factors through a map
            F : HH∗ (Cc∞ (G))γ → C ∞ (S reg )W
                                             γ
                                               (S)
                                                   ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ).
Since Oγ : HH∗ (Cc∞ (G))γ → H∗ (C(γ), Cc∞ (C(γ)u )δ ) is an isomorphism by Proposi-
tion 4, we may define
                                 σγS = F ◦ Oγ−1 ,
and all desired properties for σγS will be satisfied.

   Let γ ∈ S \ S reg be such that γ is in the closure of S reg , as above, and also let
c ∈ Hq (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ). Then a consequence of the above theorem, Theorem 2, is
                                                      S
that the germ at γ of the higher orbital integrals Og,c  depends only on Oγ . More
                   reg             ∞                         S
precisely, if g ∈ S , f ∈ HHq (Cc (G)), and we regard Og,c      (f ) as a function of g,
                                S
then its germ at γ, denoted Og,c (f )γ , is given by
                               S
(14)                          Og,c (f )γ = hσγS (Oγ (f )), ci.
   This observation allows us to relate Theorem 2 with results of Shalika [22] and Vi-
gneras [24]. So assume now that G is reductive and let ξi ∈ H0 (C(γ), Cc∞ (C(γ)u )δ )
be the basis dual to the basis of H0 (C(γ), Cc∞ (C(γ)u )δ ) given by the orbital inte-
grals over the orbits of γu, for u nilpotent in C(γ). If we let Fi = σγ (ξi ), then we
recover the usual definition of Shalika germs. Due to this fact, we shall call the
maps σγS introduced in Theorem 2 the higher Shalika germs.
   We can now characterize the range of the higher orbital integrals. Combining
all higher orbital integrals for S ⊂ G ranging through a set Σ of representatives of
standard subgroups of G, we obtain a map
                                  M
            O : HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) →       C ∞ (S reg )W (S) ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )).
                                  S∈Σ


Theorem 3. Let Σ be a set of representatives of standard subgroups of G and σγS
be the maps introduced in Theorem 2 for γ ∈ S reg \ S reg . Also, let
                         M
                    F⊂       C ∞ (S reg ) ⊗ H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )δ ),
                           S∈Σ

be the space of sections ξ satisfying ξγ = σγS (ξ(γ)). Then O establishes a R∞ (G)–
linear isomorphism
                              O : HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) −→ F .
Proof. Note first that the map O is well defined, that is, that its range is contained
in F , by Theorem 2.
   To prove that O is an isomorphism, filter both HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) and F by the
subgroups Ik HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) and, respectively, by Ik F , using the ideals Ik introduced
in Section 1. Since O is R∞ (G)–linear, it preserves this filtration and induces maps
                  Ik+1 HH∗ (Cc∞ (G))/Ik HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) → Ik+1 F /Ik F .
These maps are, by construction, exactly the isomorphisms of Proposition 2. Stan-
dard homological algebra then implies that O itself is an isomorphism, as de-
sired.
     A consequence of the above result the following “density” corollary.
Corollary 3. Let a ∈ HHq (Cc∞ (G)). If all q-higher orbital integrals of a vanish,
then a = 0.
   We shall also need certain specific cocycles below. Let τ0 be the trace τ0 (f ) =
f (e) on Cc∞ (G), G unimodular, obtained by evaluating f at the identity e of G. Let
G0 be the kernel of all unramified characters of G. Then G/G0 ≃ Zr , where r is
the rank of a split component of G. Let pj : G → Z be the morphisms obtained by
considering the jth component of Zr . Then
                                 δj (f )(g) = pj (g)f (g)

defines a derivation of Cc∞ (G). Moreover, we can identify H∗ (G) with Λ∗ Cr , the
exterior algebra with generators δ1 , . . . , δr . Fix c ∈ H∗ (G). We can assume that
c = δ1 ∧ . . . ∧ δq , and then we define the map Dc : Cc∞ (G)⊗q+1 → Cc∞ (G) by the
formula
                                         X
(15)      Dc (f0 , . . . , fq ) = (q!)−1   ǫ(σ)f0 δσ(1) (f1 )δσ(2) (f2 ) . . . δσ(q) (fq )
                                    σ∈Sq

Then τc = τ0 ◦ Dc (f0 , . . . , fq ) defines a Hochschild q cocycle on Cc∞ (G), and
(16)                                   τc = Oe,c ,
if we naturally identify c with an element of the cohomology group H∗ (G, Cc∞ (Gu )).

               3. The cohomology of the unipotent variety
   It follows from the main result of the first section, Theorem 1, that, in order to
obtain a more precise description of the Hochschild homology of Cc∞ (G), we need
to understand the continuous cohomology of the H–module Cc∞ (Hu )δ , where H
ranges through the set of centralizers of standard subgroups of G and Hu is the
variety of unipotent elements in H. (We call the variety Hu the unipotent variety of
H.) Since the cohomology groups Hk (H, Cc∞ (Hu )δ ) depend only on H, it is enough
to consider the case H = G. In this section we gather some results on the groups
Hq (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ).
   We first need to recall the computation of the groups H∗ (G) = H∗ (G, C), [6].
More generally, we also need to compute H∗ (G, Cχ ), where χ : G → C∗ is a charac-
ter of G and Cχ = C as a vector space, but with G–action given by the character
χ.
   Assume first that G = S is a commutative p–adic group, and let S0 be the union
of all compact-open subgroups of S. Then S0 is a subgroup of S and S/S0 is a free
abelian subgroup, whose rank we denote by rk(S). For this group we then have
                          Hk (S) ≃ Hk (S/S0 , C) ≃ Λk C rk(S) .
    For an arbitrary p–adic group G, we may identify the cohomology groups Hq (G)
with those of a commutative p–adic group. Indeed, if G0 is the connected com-
ponent of G (in the sense of algebraic groups) then G/G0 is finite, and hence
Hq (G) ≃ Hq (G0 ), by the Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence. This tells us that
we may assume G to be connected as an algebraic group. Choose then a Levi
decomposition G = M N , where N is the unipotent radical of G, M is a reduc-
tive subgroup, uniquely determined up to conjugation, and the product M N is a
semidirect product. Since Hq (N ) = 0 for q > 0, it follows that Hq (G) ≃ Hq (M ).
Let M1 ⊂ M be the commutator subgroup of M , which is also a p–adic group, see
[5]. The cohomology groups Hq (M1 ) were computed in [4], Proposition 6.1, page
316, and [6] and they also vanish for q > 0 (because the fundamental domain of the
building of G is a simplex). All in all, we obtain that
                             Hq (G) ≃ Hq (M ) ≃ Hq (M ab ),
where M ab = M/M1 is the abelianization of M .
  We summarize the above discussion in the following well known statement.
Lemma 4. Let G be a p–adic group, not necessarily reductive, and let r be the rank
of a split component of the reductive quotient of G. Then
                              Hq (G) = Hq (G, C) ≃ Λq Cr ,
16                                         V. NISTOR


and Hq (G, Cχ ) = 0, if χ is a nontrivial character of G.
     We continue with a few elementary remarks on Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ).
Remark 1. If G1 → G is a surjective morphism with finite kernel F , then there
exists a natural homeomorphism G1u ≃ Gu of the unipotent varieties of the two
groups. Since the kernel F acts trivially on G1u , using the Hochschild-Serre spectral
sequence we obtain an isomorphism
(17)          Hk (G1 , Cc∞ (G1 u )δ ) ≃ Hk (G1 , Cc∞ (Gu )) ≃ Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ).

Remark 2. If G ⊂ G1 is a normal p–adic subgroup with F ≃ G1 /G finite, then we
again have a natural homeomorphism G1u = Gu . This gives
(18)        Hk (G1 , Cc∞ (G1 u )δ ) ≃ Hk (G1 , Cc∞ (Gu )δ ) ≃ Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ )F ,
using once again the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. In particular, if the char-
acteristic morphism F → Aut(G)/ Inn(G) is trivial, then we get a natural isomor-
phism Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ) ≃ Hk (G1 , Cc∞ (G1 u )δ ).

Remark 3. If G = G′ × G′′ , then Gu = G′u × G′′u naturally, and hence Cc∞ (Gu ) ≃
Cc∞ (G′u ) ⊗ Cc∞ (G′′u ). This gives
                                     M
(19)         Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ) ≃     Hi (G′ , Cc∞ (G′u )) ⊗ Hj (G′′ , Cc∞ (G′′u )).
                                   i+j=k


Remark 4. If Z is a commutative p–adic group of split rank r, then
                           Hk (Z, Cc∞ (Zu )δ ) ≃ Cc∞ (Zu ) ⊗ Λk Cr .

Remark 5. The above isomorphisms reduce the computation of Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ )
for G reductive, to the computation of the cohomology groups corresponding to its
semisimple quotient H := G/Z(G):
                                                   M
(20)     Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ) = Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )) ≃   Hi (H, Cc∞ (Hu )δ ) ⊗ Λj Cr ,
                                                       i+j=k

where r is the rank of a split component of G.
  Let τ0 be the trace obtained by evaluating at the identity. Using τ0 , we obtain
an injection H j (G) ∋ c → τ0 ⊗ c ∈ H j (G, Cc∞ (Gu )).
   In order to obtain more precise results on H∗ (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ), we need to take
a closer look at the structure of Cc∞ (Gu ) as a G–module. For a G–space X, we
denote by hXi the quotient space X/G with the induced topology, which may be
non-Hausdorff. Thus hGu i is the set of unipotent conjugacy classes of G.
   Assume now that hGu i is a finite set. (This happens for example if G is reductive,
because the ground field F has characteristic zero.) Then the space Gu can be
written as an increasing union of open G–invariant sets Ul ⊂ Gu , U−1 = ∅, such
that each difference set Ul \ Ul−1 is a disjoint union of open and closed G–orbits,
(21)                                 Ul \ Ul−1 = ∪Xl,j .
A filtration Ul with these properties will be called “nice.” There may be several
nice filtrations of Gu .
   A nice filtration of Gu , as above, gives rise, by standard arguments, to a spectral
sequence converging to Hk (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ), as follows. First, let hgi ∈ hGu i be the

orbit through an element g ∈ Gu . Also, let C(g) denote the centralizer of g ∈ Gu
and rg denote the rank of a split component of C(g) if C(g) is unimodular, rg = 0
otherwise. This definition of rg is justified by Hk (C(g), ∆C(g) ) ≃ Λk Crg .
Proposition 6. Let G be a p–adic group with finitely many unipotent orbits (i.e.,
hGu i is finite). Then, for any nice filtration (Ul ) of Gu by open G–invariant subsets,
there exists a natural spectral sequence with
                                           M
                              2
                             Ep,q =                 Λp+q Cru ,

convergent to   Hp+q (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ).
Proof. The argument is standard and goes as follows. Recall first that any filtration
0 = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ FN = Cc∞ (Gu )δ by G–submodules gives rise to a spectral
                  1
sequence with Ep,q   = Hp+q (G, Fp /Fp−1 ), convergent to Hp+q (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ).
    Now, associated to the open sets Ul of a nice filtration, there exists an increasing
filtration Fl = Cc∞ (Ul )δ ⊂ Cc∞ (Gu )δ by G–submodules such that
                                                    M
                         Cc∞ (Ul )δ /Cc∞ (Ul−1 )δ ≃   Cc∞ (Xl,j )δ ,
                                                           j

where each Xl,j is the orbit of a unipotent element, and Ul \ Ul−1 has the topology
given by the disjoint union of the orbits Xl,j . Fix l and j, and let u be a unipotent
element in Xl,j (so that then Xl,j is the orbit through u), which implies that
Cc∞ (Xl,j ) ≃ indG
                 C(u) (∆C(u) ). Finally, from Shapiro’s lemma we obtain that

                    Hk (G, Cc∞ (Xl,j )δ ) ≃ Hk (C(u), ∆C(u) ) ≃ Λk Cru ,
and this completes the proof.
   We expect this spectral sequence to converge for G reductive. This is the case,
for example for G = GLn (F) and for SLn (F). See Section 5. The convergence
of the spectral sequence implies, in particular, the convergence of the orbital in-
tegrals of unipotent elements in reductive groups (which is a well known fact due
to Deligne and Rao [18]). In general, the convergence of the spectral sequence of
the above proposition can be interpreted to represent the convergence of “higher
orbital integrals.”

                    4. Induction and the unipotent variety
   We assume from now on that G is reductive, and we fix a parabolic subgroup
P ⊂ G, P 6= G, and a Levi subgroup M ⊂ P , so that P = M N , where N is the
unipotent radical of P , and the product is a semidirect product. In this section, we
relate H∗ (G, Cc∞ (Gu )δ ) to the groups, H∗ (P, Cc∞ (Pu )δ ) and H∗ (M, Cc∞ (Mu )δ ). He
have considered non-unimodular subgroups in the previous sections in order to be
able to handle subgroups like P .
   Let K be a “good” maximal compact subgroup of G (see [9], Theorem 5), so
that G = KP . This decomposition shows that the map
                              K × P ∋ (k, p) → kpk −1 ∈ G
is proper, and hence the map G ×P P := (G × P )/P ∋ (g, p) → gpg −1 ∈ G is also
proper. This gives a map
    Cc∞ (G)δ = Cc∞ (G) → Cc∞ (G ×P P ) ≃ indG   ∞                  G ∞
                                            P (Cc (P ) ⊗ ∆P ) = indP (Cc (P )δ )

of G-modules. This map of G–modules and the standard identification of Hoch-
schild homology with continuous cohomology, equation (9), then give a morphism

     HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)) ≃ H∗ (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ) −→ H∗ (G, indG   ∞
                                                    P (Cc (P )δ ) ⊗ ∆G )

of Hochschild homology groups. The main result of this section states that indG
                                                                              P is
induced by a morphism of algebras, which we now proceed to define.
   Let dk be the normalized Haar measure on the maximal compact subgroup K,
normalized such that K has volume 1. The composition of kernels
                                       Z
                    T1 T2 (k1 , k2 ) =   T1 (k1 , k)T2 (k, k2 )dk
                                           G/P
               ∞
defines on C (K × K) an algebra structure. Let
(23)                     φG    ∞         ∞           ∞
                          P : Cc (G) −→ C (K × K) ⊗ Cc (P ),
                                               −1
be defined by φG P (f )(k1 , k2 , p) = f (k1 pk2 ).
   Recall [9] that the push-forward of the product dpdk of Haar measure on P × K,
via the multiplication map P × K ∋ (p, k) → pk ∈ G, is a left invariant measure
on G, and hence a multiple λdg of the Haar measure dg on G. Suppose that the
measure dk of K is the restriction of dg to K, and has total mass 1. Then the
Haar measures on G and P will be called compatible if λ = 1. We shall need the
following result of Harish Chandra (implicitly stated in [23]):
Lemma 5. Suppose the Haar measures on G and P are compatible. Then the
linear map φG
            P , defined above in equation (23), is a morphism of algebras.

Proof. The product on C ∞ (K × K) ⊗ Cc∞ (P ) = Cc∞ (K × K × P ) is given by the
formula                            Z Z
           (h1 h2 )(k1 , k2 , p) =     h1 (k1 , k, q)h2 (k, k2 , q −1 p)dqdk.
                                      K    P
Let ∗ denote the multiplication (i.e., convolution product) on Cc∞ (G). Thus, we
need to prove that
                                   Z Z
             f1 ∗ f2 (k1 pk2−1 ) =     f1 (k1 qk −1 )f2 (kq −1 pk2−1 )dqdk,
                                      K    P

for all f1 , f2 ∈  Cc∞ (G).  Consider the map P × K ∋ (q, k) → g := qk −1 ∈ G, and
let dµ be the push-forward of the measure dqdk. Then the right-hand side of the
above formula becomes
         Z Z                                         Z
                 f1 (k1 qk −1 )f2 (kq −1 pk2 )dqdk =   f1 (k1 g)f2 (g −1 pk2−1 )dµ(g).
           K   P                                       G

We know that dµ = dg, by assumptions (see the discussion before the statement of
this lemma), and then
  Z                                    Z
      f1 (k1 g)f2 (g −1 pk2−1 )dµ(g) =   f1 (g)f2 (g −1 k1 pk2−1 )dµ(g) = f1 ∗ f2 (k1 pk2−1 ),
     G                                 G
by the invariance of the Haar measure. The lemma is proved.

   The trace C ∞ (K × K) → C induces an isomorphism
                       τ : HH∗ (C ∞ (K × K) ⊗ Cc∞ (P )) ≃ HH∗ (Cc∞ (P )).
Explicitly, this isomorphism is given at the level of chains by
   τ (f0 ⊗ f1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ fq )(p0 , p1 , . . . , pq )
                          Z
                       :=          f0 (k0 , k1 , p0 )f1 (k1 , k2 , p1 ) . . . fq (kq , k0 , pq )dk0 . . . dkq .
                               K q+1

This isomorphism combines with φG
                                P to give a morphism

                               P )∗ : HH∗ (Cc (G)) −→ HH∗ (Cc (P )).

Theorem 4. Let P be a parabolic subgroup of a reductive p–adic group G. Consider
                             G
the morphisms (φG                       ∞                  ∞
                 P )∗ and indP : HH∗ (Cc (G)) −→ HH∗ (Cc (P )), defined above
                                  G         G
(Equations (24) and (22)). Then (φP )∗ = indP .
Proof. Let M1 and M2 be two left G–modules. We can regard M1 as a right module,
and then the tensor product M1 ⊗G M2 is the quotient of M1 ⊗ M2 by the group
generated by the elements gm1 ⊗ gm2 − m1 ⊗ m2 , as before. Alternatively, we can
think of M1 ⊗G M2 as (M1 ⊗ M2 ) ⊗G C. This justifies the notation f ⊗G 1 for a
morphism M1 ⊗G M2 → M1′ ⊗G M2′ induced by a morphism
                               f = f1 ⊗ f2 : M1 ⊗ M2 → M1′ ⊗ M2′ .
   We shall prove the theorem by an explicit computation. To this end, we shall
use the results and notation (hG and h̃G = hG ⊗G 1) of Lemma 1.
   By direct computation, we see that the morphism
                                τ ◦ φG    ∞
                                     P : Cc (G)

                                                    → Cc∞ (P )⊗q+1
between Hochschild complexes, is given by the formula
(25) τ ◦ φG
          P (f )(p0 , p1 , . . . , pq ) =
                                Z

   We now want to realize the map indG              ∞                  ∞
                                         P : HH∗ (Cc (G)) −→ HH∗ (Cc (P )), at the
level of complexes. In the process, it will be convenient to identify the smooth G-
module Cc∞ ((G × P )/P ) ≃ indG   ∞
                              P (Cc (P )δ ) with a subspace of the space of functions
on G × P , using the projection G × P → (G × P )/P .
   Consider the G–morphism
                         l : Bq (G) ⊗ Cc∞ (G) → Bq (G) ⊗ indG   ∞
                                                            P (Cc (P )δ )

induced by the morphism
                             Cc∞ (G) → indG   ∞            ∞
                                          P (Cc (P )δ ) ⊂ C (G × P ).

Explicitly,
                l(f )(g0 , g1 , . . . , gq , g, p) = f (g0 , g1 , . . . , gq , gpg −1 ).
Then the resulting morphism
          l ⊗G 1 : Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ) = Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ) → Hq (G, indG   ∞

     The G–morphism

       r(f )(g, p0 , p1 , . . . , pq , p) =           f (gp0 k1−1 , gp1 k2−1 , . . . , gpn k0−1 , g, p)dk,
                                              K q+1

(dk = dk0 . . . dkq ) is well defined and induces an isomorphism in homology, because
the only nonzero homology groups are in dimension 0, and they are both isomorphic
to indG   ∞
      P (Cc (P )δ ). We have an isomorphism

             χ : indG             ∞                            ∞
                    P (Bq (P ) ⊗ Cc (P )δ ) ⊗G C → (Bq (P ) ⊗ Cc (P )δ ) ⊗P C,

of complexes. This shows that the homology of the second complex in (26) is
isomorphic to Hq (P, Cc∞ (P )δ ), and that the map induced on homology, that is
                    χ(r ⊗G 1) : Hq (G, indG   ∞                    ∞
                                          P (Cc (P )δ )) → Hq (P, Cc (P )δ ),

is the Shapiro isomorphism.
    Recall now that the isomorphism Hq (G, Cc∞ (G)δ ) ≃ HHq (Cc∞ (G)) is induced
by the morphism of complexes h̃q defined in Lemma 1, Equation (9). From the
definition of the morphism indG          ∞                ∞
                               P : HH∗ (Cc (G)) → HH∗ (Cc (P )) and the above dis-
cussion, we obtain the equality of the morphisms Hq (G, Cc (G)δ ) → Hq (P, Cc∞ (P )δ )
                                                         ∞
                                      G
induced by χ(rl ⊗G 1) and h̃−1P ◦ indP ◦h̃G . Thus, in order to complete the proof,
it would be enough to check that h̃P ◦ χ(rl ⊗G 1) = τ ◦ φG   P ◦ h̃G at the level of
complexes. Let
                  t : Bq (G) ⊗ indG   ∞                        G ∞
                                  P (Cc (P )δ ) → Bq (G) ⊗G indP (Cc (P )δ )

be the projection. Since hG is surjective, it is also enough to check that h̃P χ(r ⊗G
1)tl = τ φG  P hG .
    Let
                                     Z
 r′ (f )(p0 , p1 , . . . , pq , p) =   f ( k ′ p0 k1−1 , k ′ p1 k2−1 , . . . , k ′ pn k0−1 , k ′ , p)dk ′ dk,
                                    K×K q+1

where dk = dk0 . . . dkq , as before. Then r′ induces a morphism
                       r′ : Bq (G) ⊗ indG   ∞                      ∞
                                        P (Cc (P )δ ) → Bq (P ) ⊗ Cc (P )δ

of complexes satisfying hP ◦ r′ = h̃P χ(r ⊗G 1)t. Directly from the definitions we
obtain then that hP ◦ r′ ◦ l = τ ◦ φG
                                    P ◦ hG . This completes the proof.

   For simplicity, we have stated and proved the above result only for G reductive,
however, it extends to general G and P such that G/P is compact, by including
the modular function of G, where appropriate.
   In order to better understand the effect of the morphism
                       indG     G            ∞               ∞
                          P = (φP )∗ : HH∗ (Cc (G)) −→ HH∗ (Cc (P )),

it is sometimes useful to look at its action on the geometric fibers of the group
HH∗ (Cc∞ (G)). This is especially useful because the action on the geometric fibers
also recovers the classical results on the characters of induced representations.

   First we observe that restriction defines a morphism ρG    ∞          ∞
                                                         P : R (G) → R (P ). In
case the group G is reductive and M is a Levi component of the parabolic subgroup
P , we also have R∞ (P ) ≃ R∞ (M ).
Lemma 6. Let P be a parabolic subgroup of a reductive p–adic group G, and let
ρG    ∞         ∞
 P : R (G) → R (P ) be the morphism induced by restriction, used to define a
R (G)–module structure on HH∗ (Cc∞ (P )). Then

                           P : HH∗ (Cc (G)) −→ HH∗ (Cc (P ))

is R∞ (G)–linear, in the sense that indG          G         G                   ∞
                                       P (f ξ) = ρP (f ) indP (ξ), for all f ∈ R (G)
                  ∞
and all ξ ∈ HH∗ (Cc (G)).
Proof. The result of the lemma follows from the fact that the map
                               Cc∞ (G) → indG   ∞
                                            P (Cc (P )δ )
is R∞ (G)–linear and the isomorphism of Shapiro’s Lemma,
                       Hq (G, indG   ∞                   ∞
                                 P (Cc (P )δ ) ≃ Hq (P, Cc (P )δ ),
is natural.
   Alternatively, one can use the explicit formula of equation (25).
   If m = mγ ⊂ R∞ (G) is the maximal ideal of functions vanishing at a semisimple
element γ ∈ G, then its image (ρG               G     ∞         ∞         ∞
                                   P )∗ (m) := ρP (m)R (P ) ⊂ R (P ) = R (M ) is
the ideal of functions vanishing at all g ∈ M that are conjugated to γ in G. If γ
is elliptic, then m = R∞ (P ). If γ ∈ M , then m need not, in general, be maximal.
Nevertheless, we obtain a morphism
         (ρG           ∞        ∞         ∞       G
           P )γ : C ≃ R (G)γ = R (G)/m → R (M )/(ρP )∗ (m) ≃ C
                                                               #hγi
                                                                    ,
where #hγi = l is the set of conjugacy classes in M that consist of elements that are
conjugated to γ in the bigger group G. Let γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γl ∈ M be representatives
of the conjugacy classes of element in M that are conjugated to γ in G.
   We are ready now to study the morphisms
  (indG            ∞               ∞              ∞
      P )γ : HHq (Cc (G))γ = HHq (Cc (G))/m HHq (Cc (G))
                                                                     l
                                                                     M
                                 −→ HHq (Cc∞ (P ))/(ρG
                                                     P )∗ (m) ≃             HHq (Cc∞ (P ))γj .
                                                                     j=1

   Let CP (γj ) be the centralizer of γj in P and CG (γj ) ≃ CG (γ) be the centralizer
of γj in G. Then CP (γj )u identifies with a subspace of CG (γ)u , which gives rise to a
continuous proper map CG (γ) ×CP (γ) CP (γ)u → CG (γ)u , and hence to a morphism
                                            C (γ)
                      Cc∞ (CG (γ)u ) → indCG
                                           P (γj )
                                                   (Cc∞ (CP (γj )u )δ )
of CG (γ)–modules. Passing to cohomology, we obtain using Shapiro’s Lemma a
morphism
           ιγγj : Hq (CG (γ), Cc∞ (CG (γ)u )) −→ Hq (CP (γ), Cc∞ (CP (γj )u )δ ).
  Recall that Proposition 4 gives isomorphisms
                     HHq (Cc∞ (G))γ ≃ Hq (CG (γ)), Cc∞ (CG (γ)u ))
and
                   HHq (Cc∞ (P ))γj ≃ Hq (CP (γj )), Cc∞ (CP (γj )u )δ ).

Proposition 7. Let γ ∈ G be a semisimple element and M ⊂ P be as above. If
the conjugacy class of γ does not intersect M , then HH∗ (Cc∞ (P ))γ = 0, and hence
(indG
    P )γ = 0. Otherwise, using the notation above, we have

                   (indG       l    γ          ∞               ∞
                       P )γ = ⊕j=1 ιγj : HH∗ (Cc (G))γ → HH∗ (Cc (P ))γ .

Proof. This follows from definitions if we observe that in the sequence of maps

     G ×P P ×CP (γi ) (γi CP (γi )u ) ≃ G ×CG (γi ) CG (γi ) ×CP (γi ) (γi CP (γi )u )
                                                                  → G ×CG (γi ) (γi CG (γi )u )
the second map is induced by CG (γi ) ×CP (γi ) CP (γi )u → CG (γi )u and their com-
position induces on homology the direct summand ιγγj of the map (indG   P )γ .

   Another morphism that is likely to play an important role is the “inflation,”
which we now define. Let N ⊂ P be the unipotent radical of an algebraic p–adic
group, and let M = P/N be its reductive quotient. Then integration over N defines
an algebra morphism
                                                       Z
                P
               ψM : Cc∞ (P ) → Cc∞ (M ) , ψM
                                           P
                                             (f )(m) =   f (mn)dn.
                                                                   N

Integration over N also defines a G-morphism Cc∞ (P )δ → Cc∞ (M ), and, since N is
a union of compact subgroups, we finally obtain morphisms
                   Hk (P, Cc∞ (P )δ ) → Hk (P, Cc∞ (M )) ≃ Hk (M, Cc∞ (M )),
whose composition we denote inf P
                                M.

Theorem 5. If M is a Levi component of a p-adic group P over a field of char-
acteristic zero, as above. Then we have
                        P
                      (ψM )∗ = inf P         ∞               ∞
                                   M : HH∗ (Cc (P )) → HH∗ (Cc (M )).

Proof. Integration over N defines a morphism
                           f : B(P ) ⊗ Cc∞ (P )δ → B(M ) ⊗ Cc∞ (M ),
which commutes with the action of P . Then f ⊗P 1 coincides with the morphism
                           P
of complexes induced by ψM   .
                                                                         P
   Consider now the maps hG defined in the proof of Lemma 1. Then ψM       ◦ hP =
                    P
hM ◦ f , and hence ψM ◦ h̃P = h̃M ◦ (f ⊗P 1), from which the result follows.

   We now want to proceed by analogy and establish the explicit form of the action
of inf P
       M on the geometric fibers. Fix γ ∈ M . Again, integration over the nilpotent
radical of CP (γ), the centralizer of γ in P , induces a morphism
                 Cc∞ (CP (γ)u )δ = Cc∞ (CP (γ)u ) ⊗ ∆CP (γ) → Cc∞ (CM (γ)u ),
of P -modules. Let

     jγ : HH∗ (Cc∞ (P ))γ = H∗ (CP (γ), Cc∞ (CP (γ)u )δ )
                                        −→ H∗ (CM (γ), Cc∞ (CM (γ)u )) = HH∗ (Cc∞ (M ))γ
be the induced morphism.

Proposition 8. Let γ be a semisimple element of a Levi component M of the
group P . Let d(γ) be the determinant of Ad−1
                                            γ − 1 acting on Lie(N )/ ker(Adγ − 1).
Then, using localization at the maximal ideal defined by γ in R∞ (G) = R∞ (P ) and
the above notation,
             (inf P
                  M )γ = |d(γ)|
                                −1
                                   jγ : HH∗ (Cc∞ (P ))γ → HH∗ (Cc∞ (M ))γ .
Proof. Fix γ ∈ G, not necessarily semisimple and let Nγ be the subgroup of
elements of N commuting with γ. We choose a complement Vγ of Lie(Nγ ) in
Lie(N ) and we use the exponential map to identify Vγ with a subset of N . Then
the Jacobian of the map
                  Vγ × Nγ ∋ (n, n′ ) → γ −1 nγn−1 n′ ∈ N = Vγ Nγ
is d(γ), and from this the result follows.
   This result is compatible with the results of van Dijk on characters of induced
representations, see [8].

                                   5. Examples
   Our results can be used to obtain some very explicit results in certain particular
cases.
   Example 1. Let Z be a commutative p-adic group of split rank r (so that
Hq (Z) ≃ Λq Cr , for all q ≥ 0). Then
(27)                      HHq (Cc∞ (Z)) ≃ Cc∞ (Z) ⊗ Λq Cr .

  Example 2. Let P be the (parabolic) subgroup of upper triangular matrices in
SL2 (F), and A ⊂ P be the subgroup of diagonal matrices. Then inflation defines a
morphism
              inf P         ∞               ∞         ∞        ∗
                  A : HH∗ (Cc (P )) → HH∗ (Cc (A)) = Cc (A) ⊗ Λ C
whose range is Cc∞ (A) ⊕ Cc∞ (A \ {±I}), with I the identity matrix of SL2 (F). (We
see this by localizing at each γ.) To describe the kernel of inf P
                                                                 A , let
                                               
                                          1 b
(28)                               ub =           .
                                          0 1
Then, if we choose b to range through Σu , a set of representative of F∗ /F∗2 , the
set of elements ub forms a set of representatives of the set of nontrivial conjugacy
classes of unipotent elements of P . Recall that F has characteristic zero, so Σu is a
discrete set. Let Ob,+ be the orbital integral associated to ub , and let Ob,− be the
orbital integral associated to −ub , then
                           F± = ⊕b Ob,± : Cc∞ (G) → CΣu
identify the kernel of inf P                                         P
                            A as follows. The map F+ ⊕ F− : ker(inf A ) → C
                                                                             ±Σu
                                                                                 is
injective, and the range of each of F± is the set of elements with zero sum.
   All in all, let us consider the map Φ = inf P
                                               A ⊕F+ ⊕ F− ,

          Φ : HH∗ (Cc∞ (P )) → (Cc∞ (A) ⊕ C±Σu )(0) ⊕ (Cc∞ (A \ {±I}))(1) ,
where the lower index (i) represents the degree. Then Φ is surjective in degree
                                                   ∞
           ∗  ∗2
                             P of (f, λb,ǫ ), f ∈ Cc (A), λ ∈ C, for ǫ ∈ {±1} and
1, and, in degree 0, it consists
b ∈ Σu ≃ F /F , such that b λb,ǫ = f (ǫI), for ǫ = ±1.

   Note that evaluation at ±I does not define a trace on Cc∞ (P ). Actually, in the
spectral sequence of Proposition 6, the obstruction to extend the evaluation at I to
a trace is responsible for “killing” the 1 cohomology supported at I (which explains
our claim on the range of inf P A above).

   Example 3. Consider now the group G = SL2 (F), where F is a p-adic field
of characteristic zero such that the characteristic of the residual field is not 2, for
simplicity. Let Fq be the residual field of F (thus q = pn , for some n ∈ N and some
prime p, denotes the number of elements of Fq . We choose ǫ in the valuation ring
of F, whose image in Fq is not a square. Also, let τ be a generator of the (unique)
maximal ideal of the valuation ring of F. We shall use the notation of [20] and
thus let θ range through the set {ǫ, τ, ǫτ } and let Tθ Tθ# be the elliptic tori defined
there. (Recall that Tθ = {[aij ], a11 = a22 , a21 = θa12 } and Tθ# = {[aij ], a11 =
a22 , a21 = θ# a12 }, where θ# = θa2 , for some a ∈ F2 not in the image of the norm
map N : F[θ]∗ → F∗ .) We distinguish two cases, first the case where −1 is a square
and then the case where it is not a square. If −1 is a square, then the Weyl group
of each of the tori T = Tθ , Tθ# has order 2. Otherwise W (T ) = {1}, for each T = Tθ
or T = Tθ# , but Tθ and Tθ# are conjugate for each fixed θ.
   Let X = ∪θ Tθ /S2 ∪ ∪θ Tθ# /S2 , if −1 is a square, and X = ∪θ Tθ otherwise, with
the induced topology. Then X \ {±} identifies with the set of elliptic conjugacy
classes of SL2 (F).
   Denote by A ⊂ SL2 (F) the set of diagonal matrices in SL2 (F). Let W (A) = S2
act on Cc∞ (A) ⊗ Λ∗ C by conjugation on Cc∞ (A) and act by the nontrivial character
on C. Then we have the following. Recall that there are 10 conjugacy classes of
unipotent elements in SL2 (F), if p 6= 2.
Proposition 9. The composition
           φ := inf P      G         ∞                         ∞        ∗
                    A ◦ indP : HH∗ (Cc (SL2 (F))) → HH∗ (A) = Cc (A) ⊗ Λ C

has range consisting of W (A) invariant elements, and the kernel of φ is isomorphic
to Cc∞ (X \ {±I}) ⊕ C10 , via orbital integrals with respect to elliptic and unipotent
elements.
Proof. First of all, it is clear that the composition φ = inf P      G
                                                              A ◦ indP is invariant with
respect to the Weyl group W (A), and hence its range consists of W (A)-invariant
elements.
   The localization of φ at a regular, diagonal conjugacy class γ is onto by Proposi-
tion 4. Next, we know that every orbital integral extends to Cc∞ (SL2 (F)), and this
implies directly that the spectral sequence of Proposition 6 collapses at the E 2 term.
This proves that the localization of φ at γ = 1 is also onto, and hence φ is onto.
The rest of the proposition follows also from Proposition 6 by localization.

     This example is also discussed in [4], but from a different perspective.
     Example 4. We end this section with a description of the ingredients entering
in the formula (1) for the of the Hochschild homology of Cc∞ (G), if G = GLn (F).
Let γ ∈ G be a semisimple element. The minimal polynomial Qγ of γ decomposes
as Qγ = p1 p2 . . . pr into irreducible polynomials with coefficients in F. (We assume,
for simplicity, that each polynomial pj is a monic polynomial.) Also, let Pγ =
pl11 pl22 . . . plrr be the characteristic polynomial of γ. Then the algebra generated by

γ is
                               F[γ] ≃ K1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Kr ,
where Ki = F[t]/(pi (t)) are not necessarily distinct fields. The commutant {γ}′ of
γ in Mn (F) is the commutant of this algebra, and hence
                   {γ}′ ≃ Ml1 (K1 ) ⊕ Ml2 (K2 ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ Mlr (Kr ),
                           r
                           Y                                   r
                                                               Y
                  C(γ) ≃         GLli (Ki ) , S := Z(C(γ)) ≃         K∗i ,
                           i=1                                 i=1
and
S reg = {(xi ) ∈ S, xi generates Ki and the minimal polynomials of xi are distinct}.
   By the Skolem–Noether theorem, the Weyl group W (S) = N (S)/C(S) coincides
with the group of algebra automorphisms of {γ}′. This group has as quotient a
group isomorphic to the subgroup Π ⊂ N (S) which permutes the algebras Mli (Ki )
Then Π ∼= Sm1 × . . . × Smt , that is, Π is a product of symmetric
                                                               Qr groups. We denote
the kernel of this morphism by W0 (S). It is isomorphic to i=1 AutF (Ki ) (again
by the Skolem–Noether theorem). The group W (S) is then the semidirect product
of W0 (S) by Π. We hence obtain exact sequences
                       1 −→ N0 (S) −→ N (S) −→ Π −→ 1
and
                       1 −→ C(S) −→ N0 (S) −→ W0 (S) −→ 1 .
    According to (1), the only other ingredients necessary to compute HH∗ (Cc∞ (G))
are the groups H∗ (C(S), Cc∞ (US )).
    Now, the unipotent variety of C(S) is the product of the unipotent varieties of
GLli (Ki ), i = 1, r, and the subgroup C(S) preserves this product decomposition.
We see then that in order to prove that the spectral sequence of Proposition 6
collapses (for any choice of open subsets Ui ), it is enough to check this for the
spectral sequence converging to the cohomology of Cc∞ (GLn (K)u ), for an arbitrary
characteristic zero p-adic field K.
    Fix a unipotent element γ ∈ GLn (K). Define then V0 = 0, Vl = ker(γ −1)l ⊂ Kn ,
if l > 0. Also, choose Wl such that Vl = Vl−1 ⊕ Wl , and define
                        P = {γ ∈ GLn (K), γVl ⊂ Vl }, and
                        M = {γ ∈ GLn (K), γWl = Wl }.
Then P is a parabolic subgroup with unipotent radical
                      N = {γ ∈ GLn (K), (γ − 1)Vl ⊂ Vl−1 },
and M is a Levi component of P . It is easy to check, from definition, that the
P –orbit of u in N is dense. The centralizer of u is then contained in P and has
split rank ≤ the split rank of P . Fix a maximal split torus A in the centralizer of
u. We can assume that this split torus is contained in M . From the definition and
by direct inspection, the map H∗ (A) → H∗ (M ) is injective, and hence the map
(29)                       H∗ (M ) −→ H∗ (A) = H∗ (C(u))
is surjective.
   Fix now a cohomology class c0 ∈ Hq (C(γ)) ≃ Hq (A) and choose a cohomology
class c ∈ Hq (M ) that maps to c0 under the above restriction map. Also, let τ be
26                                             V. NISTOR


the trace on τ0 (f ) = f (e) on Cc∞ (M ) (obtained by evaluation at the identity e).
Then the formula
(30)                         φ0 (f0 , . . . , fq ) = τ0 (Dc (f0 , . . . , fq ))
defines a Hochschild cyclic cocycle on Cc∞ (M ). Consequently,
                                      φ = φ0 ◦ inf P        G
                                                   A ◦ ◦ indP

defines a Hochschild cocycle on Cc∞ (G). For any filtration Ui of Gu by open, in-
variant open sets, such that each Ul \ Ul−1 consists of a single orbit. Suppose that
the orbit Ul \ Ul−1 is the orbit of γ ∈ GLn (F) considered above. Then the cocycle
φ will vanish on Cc∞ (Ul ) and represent the cohomology class
                           c ∈ Hq (C(γ)) ≃ Hq (G, Cc∞ (Ul \ Ul−1 )).
From this it follows that the spectral sequence of Proposition 6 degenerates at E 2 .
  It is very likely that the above argument extends to arbitrary reductive G by
choosing M and P as in [18].
