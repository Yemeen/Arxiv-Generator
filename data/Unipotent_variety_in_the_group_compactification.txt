                                                  Abstract. The unipotent variety of a reductive algebraic group G plays an impor-
                                                  tant role in the representation theory. In this paper, we will consider the closure Ū
                                                  of the unipotent variety in the De Concini-Procesi compactification Ḡ of a connected
                                                  simple algebraic group G. We will prove that Ū − U is a union of some G-stable
                                                  pieces introduced by Lusztig in [L4]. This was first conjectured by Lusztig. We will
                                                  also give an explicit description of Ū . It turns out that similar results hold for the
                                                  closure of any Steinberg fiber in Ḡ.

                                                 A connected simple algebraic group G has a “wonderful” compactification Ḡ,
                                             introduced by De Concini and Procesi. The variety Ḡ is a smooth, projective
                                             variety with G × G action on it. The G × G-orbits of Ḡ are indexed by the subsets
                                             of the simple roots.
                                                 The group G acts diagonally on Ḡ. Lusztig introduced a partition of Ḡ into
                                             finitely many G-stable pieces. The G-orbits on each piece are in one-to-one cor-
                                             respondence to the conjugacy classes of a certain reductive group. Based on the
                                             partition, he developed the theory of “Parabolic Character Sheaves” on Ḡ.
                                                 In this paper, we study the closure Ū of the unipotent variety U of G in Ḡ, par-
                                             tially based on the previous work of [Spr2]. The main result is that the boundary
                                             of the closure is a union of some G-stable pieces. (see Theorem 4.3.)
                                                 The unipotent variety plays an important role in the representation theory. One
                                             would expect that Ū, the subvariety of Ḡ, which is analogous to the subvariety U
                                             of G, also plays an important role in the theory of “Parabolic Character Sheaves”.
                                             Our result is a step toward this direction.
                                                 The arrangement of this paper is as follows. In section 1, we briefly recall some
                                             results on the B × B-orbits of Ḡ (where B is a Borel subgroup of G) and results on
                                             Ū, which were proved by Springer in [Spr1] and [Spr2]. In section 2, we first recall

the definition of the G-stable pieces and then in 2.6, we show that any G-stable
piece is the minimal G-stable subset of Ḡ that contains a particular B × B-orbit.
In the remaining part of section 2, we establish some basic facts about the Coxeter
elements, which will be used in section 4 to prove our main theorem. In section
3, we show case-by-case that certain G-stable pieces are contained in Ū . Hence a
lower bound of Ū is established.
   A naive thought about Ū is that the boundary of the “unipotent elements” are
“nilpotent cone”. In fact, it is true. A precise statement is given and proved in 4.3.
Thus we obtain an upper bound of Ū. We also show in 4.3 that the lower bound
is actually equal to the upper bound. Therefore, our main theorem is proved. In
section 4, we also consider the closure of arbitrary Steinberg fiber of G in Ḡ. (An
example of Steinberg fiber is U.) The results are similar. In the end of section 4,
we calculate the number of points of Ū over a finite field. The formula bears some
resemblance to the formula for Ḡ.

                                 1. Preliminaries
1.1. Let G be a connected, simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed
field k. Let B be a Borel subgroup of G, B − be the opposite Borel subgroup and
T = B ∩ B − . Let (αi )i∈I be the set of simple roots. For i ∈ I, we denote by
α∨          ∨
  i , ωi , ωi and si the simple coroot, the fundamental weight, the fundamental
coweight and the simple reflection corresponding to αi . We denote by <, > the
standard pairing between the weight lattice and the root lattice. For any element
w in the Weyl group W = N (T )/T , we will choose a representative ẇ in N (T ) in
the same way as in [L1, 1.1].
    For any subset J of I, let WJ be the subgroup of W generated by {sj | j ∈ J}
and W J (resp. J W ) be the set of minimal length coset representatives of W/WJ
(resp. WJ \W ). Let w0J be the unique element of maximal length in WJ . (We will
simply write w0I as w0 .) For J, K ⊂ I, we write J W K for J W ∩ W K .
1.2. For J ⊂ I, let PJ ⊃ B be the standard parabolic subgroup defined by J and
PJ− ⊃ B − be the opposite of PJ . Set LJ = PJ ∩ PJ− . Then LJ is a Levi subgroup
of PJ and PJ− . Let ZJ be the center of LJ and GJ = LJ /ZJ be its adjoint group.
We denote by πPJ (resp. πP − ) the projection of PJ (resp. PJ− ) onto GJ .
                             J
   Let Ḡ be the wonderful compactification of G ([DP] deals with the case k = C.
The generalization to arbitrary k was given in [Str]). It is an irreducible, projective
smooth G × G-variety. The G × G-orbits ZJ of Ḡ are indexed by the subsets J
of I. Moreover, ZJ = (G × G) ×P − ×PJ GJ , where PJ− × PJ acts on the right on
                                    J
G × G and on the left on GJ by (q, p) · z = πP − (q)zπPJ (p)−1 . Let hJ be the image
                                               J
of (1, 1, 1) in ZJ .
   We will identify ZI with G and the G × G-action on it is given by (g, h) · x =
gxh−1 .
   For any subvariety X of Ḡ, we denote by X̄ the closure of X in Ḡ.
   For any finite set A, we will write |A| for the cardinality of A.
          UNIPOTENT VARIETY IN THE GROUP COMPACTIFICATION                         3

1.3. For any closed subgroup H of G, we denote by Hdiag the image of the diagonal
embedding of H in G × G and by Lie(H) the corresponding Lie subalgebra of H.
For g ∈ G, we write g H for gHg −1 .
   For any parabolic subgroup P , we denote by UP its unipotent radical. We
will simply write U for UB and U − for UB− . For J ⊂ I, set UJ = U ∩ LJ and
UJ− = U − ∩ LJ .
   For parabolic subgroups P and Q, define

                                P Q = (P ∩ Q)UP .

                                                       (u̇ P )
  It is easy to see that for J, K ⊂ I and u ∈ J W K , PJ K = PJ∩Ad(u)K .
  Let U be the unipotent variety of G. Then U is stable under the action of Gdiag
and U is stable under the action of U × U and Tdiag . Moreover, U = Gdiag · U .
Similarly, Ū = Gdiag · Ū (see [Spr2, 1.4]).
1.4. Now consider the B × B-orbits on Ḡ. We use the same notation as in [Spr1].
For any J ⊂ I, u, v ∈ W , set [J, u, v] = (B × B)(u̇, v̇) · hJ . It is easy to see
                          −1                              J
that [J,      F [J, x, vz ], where u = xz with x ∈ W and z ∈ WJ . Moreover,
      F u, v] =
Ḡ =                 [J, x, w]. Springer proved the following result in [Spr1, 2.4].
     J⊂I x∈W J ,w∈W

Theorem. Let x ∈ W J , x′ ∈ W K , w, w′ ∈ W . Then [K, x′ , w′ ] is contained
in [J, x, w] if and only if K ⊂ J and there exists u ∈ WK , v ∈ WJ ∩ W K with
xvu−1 6 x′ , w′ u 6 wv and l(wv) = l(w) + l(v).
   As a consequence of the theorem, we have the following properties which will
be used later.
   (1) For any K ⊂ J, w ∈ W J and v ∈ WJ , [K, wv, v] ⊂ [J, w, 1].
   (2) For any J ⊂ I, w, w′ ∈ W J with w 6 w′ , then [J, w′ , 1] ⊂ [J, w, 1].
1.5. In this subsection, we recall some results of [Spr2].
   Let ǫ be an indeterminate. Put o = k[[ǫ]] and K = k((ǫ)). An o-valued point of
a k-variety Z is a k-morphism γ : Spec(o) −   → Z. We write Z(o) for the set of all
o-valued points of Z. Similarly, we write Z(K) for the set of all K-valued points
of Z. For γ ∈ Z(o), we have that γ(0) ∈ Z, where 0 is the closed point of Spec(o).
   By the valuative criterion of completeness (see [EGA, Ch II, 7.3.8 & 7.3.9]),
for the complete k-variety Ḡ, the inclusion o ֒→ K induces a bijective from Ḡ(o)
onto Ḡ(K). Therefore, any γ ∈ Ḡ(K) defines a point γ(0) ∈ Ḡ. In particular, any
γ ∈ U (K) defines a point γ(0) ∈ Ḡ. Here we regard U (K) as a subset of Ḡ(K) in
the natural way.
   We have that x ∈ Ū if and only if there exists γ ∈ U (K) such that γ(0) = x
(see [Spr2, 2.2]).
   Let Y be the cocharacter group of T . An element λ ∈ Y defines a point in
T (k[ǫ, ǫ−1 ]), hence a point pλ of T (K). Let H ⊂ G(o) be the subgroup consisting
of elements γ with γ(0) ∈ B. Then for γ ∈ U (K), there exists γ1 , γ2 ∈ H, w ∈ W
4                                          XUHUA HE

and λ ∈ Y , such that γ = γ1 ẇpλ γ2 . Moreover, w and λ are uniquely determined
by γ (see [Spr2, 2.6]). In this case, we will call (w, λ) admissible. Springer showed
that (w, λ − w−1 λ) is admissible for any dominant regular coweight λ (see [Spr2,
3.1]).
   For λ ∈ Y and x ∈ W with x−1 · λ dominant, we have that pλ (0) = (ẋ, ẋ) ·
hI(x−1 λ) , where I(x−1 λ) is the set of simple roots orthogonal to x−1 λ (see [Spr2,
2.5]). If moreover, (w, λ) is admissible, then there exists some t ∈ T such that
(U × U )(ẇẋt, ẋ) · hI(x−1 λ) ⊂ Ū .

                                2. the partition of ZJ
2.1. We will follow the set-up of [L4, 8.18].
    For any J ⊂ I, let P J be the set of parabolic subgroups conjugate to PJ . We
will write B for P ∅ . For P ∈ P J , Q ∈ P K and u ∈ J W K , we write pos(P, Q) = u
                                                                                  ′
if there exists g ∈ G, such that g P = PJ , g Q = u̇ PK . For J, J ′ ⊂ I and y ∈ J W J
with Ad(y)J = J ′ , define
                                                        ′
        Z̃Jy = {(P, P ′ , γ) | P ∈ P J , P ′ ∈ P J , γ = UP ′ gUP , pos(P ′ , g P ) = y}

with the G × G action given by (g1 , g2 ) · (P, Q, γ) = (g1 P , g2 P ′ , g2 γg1−1 ).
   To z = (P, P ′ , γ) ∈ Z˜Jy , we associate a sequence (Jk , Jk′ , uk , yk , Pk , Pk′ , γk )k>0
                                    ′
with Jk , Jk′ ⊂ I, uk ∈ W , yk ∈ Jk W Jk , Ad(yk )Jk = Jk′ , Pk ∈ PJk , Pk′ ∈ PJk′ , γk =
UPk′ gUPk for some g ∈ G satisfies pos(Pk′ , g Pk ) = uk . The sequence is defined as
follows.

         P0 = P, P0′ = P ′ , γ0 = γ, J0 = J, J0′ = J ′ , u0 = pos(P0′ , P0 ), y0 = y.

and that um = pos(Pm , Pm ), Pm ∈ PJm , Pm ∈ PJm       ′ for m < k. Let

where
                                    gk−1                                      ′
      gk−1 ∈ γk−1 is such that             Pk−1 contains some Levi of Pk−1 ∩ Pk−1 ,

                 uk = pos(Pk′ , Pk ), yk = u−1

                                                              ′


   It is known that the sequence is well defined. Moreover, for sufficient large n,
we have that Jn = Jn′ = Jn+1 = Jn+1       ′
                                               = · · · and un = un+1 = · · · = 1. Now we
                                                                  ′
set β(z) = u0 u1 · · · un , n ≫ 0. Then we have that β(z) ∈ J W . By [L4, 8.18] and
[L3, 2.5], the sequence (Jk , Jk′ , uk , yk )k>0 is uniquely determined by (J, β(z), y).

            UNIPOTENT VARIETY IN THE GROUP COMPACTIFICATION                                 7

   Set L̃J,w = LJn and C̃J,w = ẇL̃J,w . Let NG (L̃J,w ) be the normalizer of L̃J,w in
G. Then C̃J,w is a connected component of NG (L̃J,w ) and Z̃Jwn ,1 is a fibre bundle
over P Jn with fibres isomorphic to C̃J,w . There is a natural bijection between
C̃J,w and F = {z = (PJn , PJn , γn ) | z ∈ Z̃Jwn ,1 } under which the action of L̃J,w on
C̃J,w by conjugation corresponds to the action of PJn /UPJn on F by conjugation.
Therefore, we obtain a canonical bijection the set of G-stable subvarieties of Z̃J,w
and the set of L̃J,w -stable subvarieties of C̃J,w (see [L4, 8.21]). Moreover, a G-
stable subvariety of Z̃J,w is closed if and only if the corresponding L̃J,w -stable
subvariety of C̃J,w is closed. By the remark 1 of 2.3, for any b ∈ B ∩ L̃J,w , the
                              −1
G-orbit that contains (PJ , ẇJ PJ ∗ , ẇb) corresponds to the L̃J,w -orbit that contains
ẇb via the bijection.
2.5. Since G is adjoint, the center of P/UP is connected for any parabolic subgroup
P . Let HP be the inverse image of the (connected) center of P/UP under P −                 →
P/UP . We can regard HP /UP as a single torus ∆J independent of P . Now ∆J
acts (freely) on Z̃J by δ : (P, P ′ , γ) 7→ (P, P ′ , γz) where z ∈ HP represents δ ∈ ∆J .
The action of G on Z̃J commutes with the action of ∆J and induces an action
of G on ∆J \ Z̃J . There exists a G-equivariant isomorphism from ZJ to ∆J \ Z̃J
which sends (g1 , g2 ) · hJ to (g2 PJ , g1 PJ− , Ug1 P − g1 g2−1 Hg2 PJ ). We will identify ZJ
                                                     J

with ∆J \ Z̃J .
   It is easy to see that ∆J (Z̃J,w ) = Z̃J,w . Set ZJ,w = ∆J \ Z̃J,w . Then
                                             G
                                     ZJ =           ZJ,w .
                                            w∈W J


   Moreover, we may identify ∆J with a closed subgroup of the center of L̃J,w . Set
LJ,w = L̃J,w /∆J and CJ,w = C̃J,w /∆J . Thus we obtain a bijection between the set
of G-stable subvarieties of ZJ,w and the set of LJ,w -stable subvarieties of CJ,w (see
[L4, 11.19]). Moreover, a G-stable subvariety of ZJ,w is closed if and only if the
corresponding LJ,w -stable subvariety of CJ,w is closed and for any b ∈ B ∩ L̃J,w , the
                              −1
G-orbit that contains (PJ , ẇJ PJ ∗ , ẇb) corresponds to the LJ,w -orbit that contains
ẇb∆J via the bijection.
Proposition 2.6. For any w ∈ W J , ZJ,w = Gdiag · [J, w, 1].
   Proof. By 2.3, (ẇ, b) · hJ ∈ ZJ,w for all b ∈ B. Since ZJ,w is G-stable,
Gdiag [J, w.1] ⊂ ZJ,w .
   For any z ∈ ZJ,w , let C be the LJ,w -stable subvariety corresponding to Gdiag · z
and let c be an element in C̃J,w such that c∆J ∈ C. By 2.2, ẇ normalizes B ∩ L̃J,w .
Thus c is L̃J,w -conjugate to an element of ẇ(B ∩ L̃J,w ). Therefore, z is G-conjugate
to (ẇ, b) · hJ for some b ∈ B ∩ L̃J,w . The proposition is proved. 
Proposition 2.7. For any w ∈ W J , ZJ,w = Gdiag (ẇT, 1) · hJ .
8                                       XUHUA HE

   Proof. Since (ẇT, 1) · hJ ⊂ ZJ,w and ZJ,w is a G-stable closed variety, we have
that Gdiag (ẇT, 1) · hJ ⊂ ZJ,w .
   Set X = {(ẇt, u) · hJ | t ∈ T, u ∈ U }. For any u ∈ ẇ UJ and t ∈ T , we have that
Ad(ẇt)−1 u ∈ UJ and u ∈ ẇ UJ ⊂ U . Consider the map φ :ẇ UJ × T −      → X defined
                                              −1    −1               ẇ
by φ(u, t) = (u, u)(ẇt, 1) · hJ = (ẇt, (ẇt) uẇtu ) · hJ , for u ∈ UJ , t ∈ T .
   It is easy to see that there is an open subset T ′ of T , such that the restriction
of φ to ẇ UJ × T ′ is injective. Note that dim(X) = dim(T ) + dim(U/UPJ ) =
dim(T ) + dim(UJ ) = dim(ẇ UJ × T ). Then the image of φ is dense in X. The
proposition is proved. 
Remark. This argument was suggested by the referee.
2.8. For w ∈ W , denote by supp(w) the set of simple roots whose associated
simple reflections occur in a reduced expression of w. An element w ∈ W is called
a Coxeter element if it is a product of the simple reflections, in some order, or in
other words, |supp(w)| = l(w) = |I|. We have the following properties.
Proposition 2.9. Fix i ∈ I. Then all the Coxeter elements are conjugate under
elements of WI−{i} .
    Proof. Let c, c′ be Coxeter elements. We say that c′ can be obtained from
c via a cyclic shift if c = si1 si2 · · · sin is a reduced expression and c′ = si1 csi1 .
It is known that for any Coxeter elements c, c′ , there exists a finite sequences of
Coxeter elements c = c0 , c1 , . . . , cm = c′ such that ck+1 can be obtained from ck
via a cyclic shift (see [Bo, p. 116, Prop. 1]).
    Now assume that c = si1 si2 · · · sin is a reduced expression of a Coxeter element.
If i1 6= i, then si1 csi1 and c are conjugated by si1 ∈ WI−{i} . If i1 = i, then
si1 csi1 = si2 si3 · · · sin c(si2 si3 · · · sin )−1 . Therefore, if a Coxeter element can be
obtained from another Coxeter element via a cyclic shift, then they are conjugated
by elements of WI−{i} . The proposition is proved. 
Remark. The proof of [loc. cit] also can be used to prove this proposition.
Proposition 2.10. Let J ⊂ I and w ∈ W J with supp(w) = I. Then there exist
a Coxeter element w′ , such that w′ ∈ W J and w′ 6 w.
   Proof. We prove the statement by induction on l(w).
   Let i ∈ I with si w < w. Then si w ∈ W J . If supp(si w) = I, then the statement
holds by induction hypothesis on si w. Now assume that supp(si w) = I − {i}. By
induction, there exists a Coxeter element w′ of WI−{i} , such that w′ ∈ W J−{i}
and w′ 6 si w. Then si w′ is a Coxeter element of w and si w′ 6 w.
   Since w′ ∈ WI−{i} , (w′ )−1 αi is either αi or a non-simple positive root. We
also have that w′ is a Coxeter element of WI−{i} . Thus if (w′ )−1 αi = αi , then
< αi , α∨
        j >= 0 for all j 6= i. It contradicts the assumption that G is simple. Hence
(w ) αi is a non-simple positive root. Note that if si w′ ∈
   ′ −1
                                                            / W J , then si w′ = w′ sj
for some j ∈ J, that is, (w ) αi = αj . Therefore, si w ∈ W J . The proposition is
                             ′ −1                        ′

proved. 

Corollary 2.11.
      J
w ∈ W . Then K⊂J w′ ∈W K ,supp(w′ )=I ZK,w′ ⊂ ZJ,w .

   Proof. By 1.4, [K, wv, v] ⊂ [J, w, 1] for K ⊂ J and v ∈ WJ . Since ZJ,w is
G-stable, (v̇ −1 ẇv̇T, 1) · hK ⊂ ZJ,w . By 2.9, (ẇ′ T, 1) · hK ⊂ ZJ,w for all Coxeter
element w′ . By 2.7, ZK,w′ ⊂ ZJ,w for all Coxeter element w′ with w′ ∈ W K .
For any u ∈ W K with supp(u) = I, there exists a Coxeter element w′ , such that
w′ ∈ W K and w′ 6 u. Thus by 1.4, we have that [K, u, 1] ⊂ ZJ,w . By 2.6,
ZK,u ⊂ ZJ,w . The corollary is proved. 
Remark. In 4.4, we will show that the equality holds.

                           3. Some combinatorial results
3.1. Fix i ∈ I. Define subsets Ik of I for all k ∈ N in the following way. Set
I1 = {i}. Assume that Ik is already defined. Set

           Ik+1 = {αj | j ∈ I − ∪kl=1 Il , < α∨
                                              j , αm >6= 0 for some m ∈ Ik }.

   It isQeasy to see that if j1 , j2 ∈ Ik with j1 6= j2 , then < αj1 , α∨     j2 >= 0. Thus
sIk = j∈Ik sj is well-defined. For sufficiently large n, we have In = In+1 = · · · =
∅ and sIn = sIn+1 = · · · = 1. Now set wk = sIn sIn−1 · · · sIk for k ∈ N. We will
write wJ for w1 . Set J−1 = I and J0 = J = I − {i}. Then wJ is a Coxeter
element and wJ ∈ W J . Let (Jn , Jn′ , un , yn ) be the sequence determined by wJ
and w0 w0J . Then we can show by induction that for k > 0, Jk = Jk−1 − Ik+1 ,
         J              J                  J
uk = w0 k−1 w0Jk sIk+1 w0 k+1 w0Jk , yk = w0 k−1 w0Jk sIk sIk−1 · · · sI1 and Jk′ = Ad(yk )Jk .
In particular, Jn = ∅. Thus L̃J,wJ = T and C̃J,wJ = ẇJ T . Since w is a Coxeter
element, the homomorphism T −        → T sending t ∈ T to (ẇJ )−1 tẇJ t−1 is surjective.
Thus L̃J,wJ acts transitively on C̃J,wJ . By 2.5, G acts transitively on ZJ,wJ .
                                 J
   For k ∈ N, we set vk = w0 k−1 w0Jk wk+1 −1
                                               . Then it is easy to see that

                       v̇k−1
                               (UPJ ′ ∩ UJk−1 ) = wk+1 (UP − ∩ UJ−k−1 ).

                                  w n−1 wn+1
Therefore by 2.3, for b ∈                      (UP − ∩ UJ−n−1 ) · · ·w2 (UP − ∩ UJ−0 )T , we have
                                                  Jn                      J1

that (ẇJ b, 1) · hJ ∈ ZJ,wJ .
   In the rest of this section, we will keep the notations of J, Jk , wJ and wk as
above. We will prove the following statement.
Proposition. Let X be a closed subvariety of Ḡ satisfying the following condition:
for any admissible pair (w, λ) and x ∈ W with x−1 λ is dominant, there exist some
t ∈ T , such that Gdiag (U × U )(ẇẋt, ẋ) · hI(x−1 λ) ⊂ X. Then ZJ,wJ ⊂ X.
  An example of such X is Ū. There are some other interesting examples, which
we will discuss in 4.5. The proof is based on case-by-case checking.
10                                           XUHUA HE

Remark. The outline of the case-by-case checking is as follows.
   For λ ∈ Y , we write λ > 0 if λ ∈ l∈I R>0 α∨
                                       P
                                                  l .
                                                 ∨
   We start with the fundamental coweight ωi . Find x ∈ W that satisfies the
conditions (1) xωi∨ > 0 and (2) for l ∈ I, either (sl − 1)xωi∨ > 0 or sl xωi∨  0.
Such x always exists, as we will see by case-by-case checking. The elements xωi∨
that we obtain in this way are not unique, in general. Fortunately, there always
exists some x ∈ W that satisfies the conditions (1) and (2) and allows us to do
the procedures that we will discuss below.
   In the rest of the remark, we fix such x. Since xωi∨ ∈ Y , there exists n ∈ N,
such that nxωi∨ is contained in the coroot lattice. Set λ = nxωi∨ . Now we can
find v ∈ W such that (v, λ) is admissible. (In practice, we find v ∈ W with
l(v) = |supp(v)| and −vλ > 0. Then we can use lemma 3.2 to check that if (v, λ)
is admissible.) By the assumption on X, Gdiag (U × U )(v̇ẋt, ẋ) · hJ ⊂ X for some
t ∈ T.
   In some cases, x−1 vx = wJ . Since wJ is a Coxeter element, (ẇJ T, 1) · hJ =
Tdiag (ẇJ t, 1) · hJ ⊂ X. By 2.7, ZJ,wJ ⊂ X.
   In other cases, the situation is more complicated. We need to choose some
u ∈ U , such that (uv̇ ẋt, ẋ) · hJ ∈ ZJ,wJ . This is the most difficult part of the
case-by-case checking. The lemma 3.3 and lemma 2.3 will be used to overcome the
difficulties.

  Throughout this section, we will use the same labelling of Dynkin diagram as in
[Bo]. For a, b ∈ I, we denote by s[a,b] the element sb sb−1 · · · sa of the Weyl group
W and ṡ[a,b] = ṡb ṡb−1 · · · ṡa . (If b < a, then s[a,b] = 1 and ṡ[a,b] = 1.)

Lemma 3.2. Let x = si1 si2 · · · sin with |supp(x)| = n. Then (1 − x−1 )ωk∨ = 0
     / {i1 , i2 , . . . , in } and (1 − x−1 )ωi∨j = sin sin−1 · · · sij+1 α∨
if k ∈                                                                     ij . Thus (x, λ) is
                              Pn                       ∨
admissible for all λ ∈ j=1 Nsin sin−1 · · · sij+1 αij .

  The lemma is a direct consequence of [Bo, p. 226, Ex. 22a], which was pointed
out to me by the referee.
Lemma 3.3. Let w, x, y1 , y2 ∈ W and t ∈ T . Assume that y1 = si1 si2 · · · sil ,
y2 = sil+1 sil+2 · · · sil+k with k + l = |supp(y1 y2 )|. If moreover, < α∨                il1 , αil2 >= 0

for all 1 6 l1 < l2 6 l and (1 − y1 y2 )xωi∨ , (1 − y1 )wωi∨ ∈                                      ∨
                                                                                    P
                                                                                      j=1 R>0 αij , then
there exists u ∈ U−w−1 αil+1 U−w−1 αil+2 · · · U−w−1 αil+k such that (ẋ−1 ẇut, 1) · hJ ∈

     Proof. We have that (1−y1 y2 )xωi∨ = j=1 (1−sij )sij+1 · · · sil+k xωi∨ . Note that
i1 , i2 , . . . , ik+l are distinct and (1 − sij )sij+1 · · · sil+k xωi∨ ∈ Rα∨       ij for all j. Hence

that ẇ−1 U−αij ẇ ∈ UP − for j 6 l.

    There exists uj ∈ Uαij and u′j ∈ U−αij such that uj ṡij uj = u′j . Note that

3.4. In subsection 3.4 to subsection 3.7, we assume that G is P GLn (k). Without
loss of generality, we assume that i 6 n/2. In this case, wJ = s[i+1,n−1] s−1                [1,i] . For
any a ∈ R, we denote by [a] the maximal integer that is less than or equal to a.
   For 1 6 j 6 i, set aj = [(j − 1)n/i]. For convenience, we will set ai+1 = n − 1.
Note that for j 6 i − 1, aj+1 − aj = [jn/i] − [(j − 1)n/i] > [n/i] > 2. Therefore, we
have that 0 = a1 < a1 + 1 < a2 < a2 + 1 < · · · < ai < ai + 1 6 ai+1 = n − 1. Now
set b0 = 0. For k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n − 1} − {a2 , a3 , . . . , ai } − {a2 + 1, a3 + 1, . . . , ai + 1},
set bk = i. For j ∈ {2, 3, . . . , i}, set baj = (j − 1)n − iak and baj +1 = i − baj . In
particular, bn−1 = i.

 l=i i(n − l)αl . Thus the lemma holds for j = i.
  Note that jn − i(aj + l) = jn − iaj+1 + i(aj+1 − aj − l) = baj+1 + i(aj+1 − aj − l).

          Thus the lemma holds for j. 
    Lemma 3.6. We have that x−1 v1 x = wJ .
          Proof. If aj > j + 1, then s−1                            −1
                                      [j+1,aj+1 ] s[aj +1,aj+1 ] = s[j+1,aj ] . If j > 2 and
    aj < j + 1, then j = 2, aj = 2 and s−1                                      −1
                                                    [3,a3 ] s[a2 +1,a3 ] = 1 = s[3,a2 ] . In conclusion,
    s−1                            −1                                     −1
     [j+1,aj+1 ] s[aj +1,aj+1 ] = s[j+1,aj ] for j > 2. Moreover, s[2,a2 ] s[a1 +1,a2 ] = s1 . Thus



     s−1                     −1
      [2,a2 ] v1 s[2,a2 ] = s[2,a2 ] s[a1 +1,a2 ] v2 s[2,a2 ] = s1 v2 s[2,a2 ] = v2 s1 s[2,a2 ] = v2 s[3,a2 ] s1 s2 .

     Thus, we can prove by induction on j that x−1 v1 x = x−1                      −1
                                                                  j vj s[j+1,aj ] s[1,j] xj for

                                                   [1,i] . The lemma is proved. 

  3.7. By 3.4 and 3.5, there exists t ∈ T , such that (U × U )(v̇ẋt, ẋ) · hJ ⊂ X.
  Consider K = {aj | baj = 0}. Then for any       j, j ′ ∈ K with j 6= j ′ , we have that

  Therefore, (ẋ ẏ v̇ ẋt, 1) · hJ ∈ X. By 3.6, x yvx = x v1 x = wJ . Therefore,
                  −1                              −1          −1

  ZJ,wJ ∩ X 6= ∅. By 3.1, G acts transitively on ZJ,wJ . Therefore ZJ,wJ ⊂ X.

                        4. The explicit description of Ū
4.1. We assume that G1 is a disconnected algebraic group such that its identity
component G0 is reductive. Following [St, 9], an element g ∈ G1 is called quasi-
semisimple if gBg −1 = B, gT g −1 = T for some Borel subgroup B of G0 and some
maximal torus T of B. We have the following properties.
   (a) if g is semisimple, then it is quasi-semisimple. See [St, 7.5, 7.6].
   (b) Let g ∈ G1 is a quasi-semisimple element and T1 be a maximal torus of
ZG0 (g)0 , where ZG0 (g)0 is the identity component of {x ∈ G0 | xg = gx}. Then
any quasi-semisimple element in gG0 is G0 -conjugate to some element of gT1 . See
[L4, 1.14].
   (c) g is quasi-semisimple if and only if the G0 -conjugacy class of g is closed
in G1 . See [Spa, 1.15(f)] for the if-part, the only-if-part is due to Lusztig in an
unpublished note. His proof is as follows.
Proposition(Lusztig). Let g ∈ G1 . Let clG0 g be the G0 -conjugacy class of g.
Assume that clG0 g is closed. Then g is quasi-semisimple.
   Proof. The proof is due to Lusztig.
   By [St 7.2], we can find a Borel subgroup B such that gBg −1 = B. Let clB g be
the B-conjugacy class of g. Since clB g ⊂ clG0 g and clG0 g is closed, we see that the
closure of clB g is contained in clG0 g. By [Spa 1.15(e)], the closure of clB g contains
           UNIPOTENT VARIETY IN THE GROUP COMPACTIFICATION                               19

a quasi-semisimple element. Hence clG0 g contains a quasi-semisimple element.
Hence g is quasi-semisimple. 
4.2. Let ρi : G − → GL(Vi ) be the irreducible representation of G with lowest
weight −ωi and ρ̄i : Ḡ −
                        → P End(Vi ) be the morphism induced from ρi (see [DS,
3.15]). Let N be the subvariety of Ḡ consisting of elements such that for all i ∈ I,
the images under ρ̄i are represented by nilpotent endomorphisms of Vi . We have
the following result.
Theorem 4.3. We have that
                                        G          G
                       Ū − U = N =                            ZJ,w .
                                        J$I w∈W J ,supp(w)=I


   Proof. By 2.11 and the results in section 3, we have that
                       G          G
                                            ZJ,w ⊂ Ū − U.
                          J$I w∈W J ,supp(w)=I

                                                          
   For i ∈ I, let Xi be the subvariety of P End(Vi ) consisting of the elements
that can be represented by unipotent or nilpotent endomorphisms of Vi . Then Xi
is closed in P (End(Vi )). Thus, ρ̄i (z) ∈ Xi for z ∈ Ū. Moreover, since G is simple,
for any g ∈ Ḡ, ρ̄i (g) is represented by an automorphism of Vi if and only if g ∈ G.
Thus if z ∈ Ū − U, then ρ̄i (z) is represented by an nilpotent endomorphism of Vi .
Therefore Ū − U ⊂ N .
   Assume that w ∈ W J with supp(w) 6= I and N ∩ZJ,w 6= ∅. Let C be the closed
LJ,w -stable subvariety that corresponds to N ∩ ZJ,w . We have seen that ẇ is a
quasi-semisimple element of NG (LJ,w ). Moreover, there exists a maximal torus
T1 in ZLJ,w (w)0 such that T1 ⊂ T . Since C is an LJ,w -stable nonempty closed
subvariety of CJ,w , ẇt ∈ C for some t ∈ T1 . Set z = (ẇt, 1) · hJ . Then z ∈ N .
   Since supp(w) 6= I, there exists i ∈ I with i ∈   / supp(w). Then −wωi = −ωi .
Let v be a lowest weight vector in Vi . Assume that ρ̄i (z) is represented by an
                                          ∗
endomorphism A   F of VF. Then Av ∈ k v. Thus z ∈      / N . That is a contradiction.
Therefore N ⊂ J$I w∈W J ,supp(w)=I ZJ,w . The theorem is proved. 
Remark. Let G = P GL4 (k) and I = {1, 2, 3}. Then the theorem implies that
Z{1,3},s2 s1 s3 s2 ⊂ Ū. By 2.5, we can see that Z{1,3},s2 s1 s3 s2 contains infinitely many
G-orbits. Therefore Ū contains infinitely many G-orbits.
Corollary 4.4. Let i ∈FI and F
                             J = I − {i} and w be a Coxeter element of W with
      J
w ∈ W . Then ZJ,w = K⊂J w′ ∈W K ,supp(w′ )=I ZK,w′ .
                                F                        F
  Proof. Note that ZJ,w ⊂ Ū ∩ ( K⊂J ZK ). Since Ū and K⊂J ZK are closed,
             F             F     F
ZJ,w ⊂ Ū ∩ ( K⊂J ZK ) = K⊂J w′ ∈W K ,supp(w′ )=I ZK,w′ . Therefore by 2.11,
       F     F
ZJ,w = K⊂J w′ ∈W K ,supp(w′ )=I ZK,w′ . 

   4.5. Let σ : G −→ T /W be the morphism which sends g ∈ G to the W -orbit in
   T that contains an element in the G-conjugacy class of the semisimple part gs .
   The map σ is called Steinberg map. The fibers of σ are called Steinberg fibers.
   The unipotent variety is an example of Steinberg fiber. Some other interesting
   examples are the regular semisimple conjugacy classes of G.
      Let F be a fiber of σ. It is known that F is a union of finitely many G-
   conjugacy classes. Let t be a representative of σ(F ) in T , then F = Gdiag · tU
   and F̄ = Gdiag · tŪ (see [Spr2, 1.4]). It is easy to see that t(Ū − U ) ⊂ N .
   Thus F̄ − F = Gdiag · t(Ū − U ) ⊂ N . Therefore, if (w, λ) is admissible and x−1 · λ
   dominant, then there exists some t′ ∈ T such that (U ×U )(ẇẋt′ , ẋ) · hI(x−1 λ) ⊂ tŪ .
                                               F      F
   Thus by 2.11 and the results in section 3, J$I w∈W J ,supp(w)=I ZJ,w ⊂ F̄ − F .
   Therefore, we have
                                                    G            G
                               F̄ − F = N =                                     ZJ,w .
                                                   J$I w∈W J ,supp(w)=I


     Thus F̄ − F is independent of the choice of the Steinberg fiber F . As a conse-
   quence, in general, F̄ contains infinitely many G-orbits (answering a question that
   Springer asked in [Spr2]).
   4.6. For any variety X that is defined over the finite field Fq , we write |X|q for
   the number of Fq -rational points in X.
      If G is defined and split over the finite field Fq , then for any w ∈ W J , |Z̃J,w |q =
   |G|q q −l(w) (see [L4, 8.20]). Thus
                                                                  X
              |ZJ,w |q = |G|q q −l(w) (q − 1)−|I−J| = (                   q l(u) )(q − 1)|J| q l(w0 w) .
                                                                 u∈W


     Set L(w) = {i ∈ I | wsi < w}. Then w ∈ W J if and only if J ⊂ L(w0 w).
                  6 1, then L(w0 w) 6= I. Therefore
   Moreover, if w =

              X              X                          X                X           X
|Ū − U|q =                              |ZJ,w |q = (         q l(w) )                            (q − 1)|J| q l(w0 w)
              J6=I w∈W J ,supp(w)=I                     w∈W              J6=I w∈W J ,supp(w)=I
              X                X            X
         =          q l(w)                          q l(w0 w) (q − 1)|J|
              w∈W            supp(w)=I J⊂L(w0 w)
              X                X
         =          q l(w)               q l(w0 w)+|L(w0 w)| .
              w∈W            supp(w)=I


   Remark. Note that |Ḡ|q = w∈W q l(w) w∈W q l(w0 w)+|L(w0 w)| (see [DP, 7.7]).

   Our formula for |Ū − U|q bears some resemblance to the formula for |Ḡ|q .
