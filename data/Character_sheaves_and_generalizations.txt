                                            1. Let k be an algebraic closure of a finite field Fq . Let G = GLn (k). The group
                                            G(Fq ) = GLn (Fq ) can be regarded as the fixed point set of the Frobenius map
                                                                       q
                                            F : G −  → G, (gij ) 7→ (gij ). Let Q̄l be an algebraic closure of the field of l-adic
                                            numbers, where l is a prime number invertible in k. The characters of irreducible
                                            representations of G(Fq ) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, which
                                            we take to be Q̄l , have been determined explicitly by J.A.Green [G]. The theory of
                                            character sheaves [L2] tries to produce some geometric objects over G from which
                                            the irreducible characters of G(Fq ) can be deduced for any q. This allows us to
                                            unify the representation theories of G(Fq ) for various q. The geometric objects
                                            needed in the theory are provided by intersection cohomology.
                                                Let X be an algebraic variety over k, let X0 be a locally closed irreducible,
                                            smooth subvariety of X and let E be a local system over X0 (we say ”local system”
                                            instead of ”Q̄l -local system”). Deligne, Goresky and MacPherson attach to this
                                            datum a canonical object IC(X̄0 , E) (intersection cohomology complex) in the
                                            derived category D(X) of Q̄l -sheaves on X; this is a complex of sheaves which
                                            extends E to X (by 0 outside the closure X̄0 of X0 ) in the most economical possible
                                            way so that local Poicaré duality is satisfied. We say that IC(X̄0 , E) is irreducible
                                            if E is irreducible.
                                                Now take X = G and take X0 = Grs to be the set of regular semisimple
                                            elements in G. Let T be the group of diagonal matrices in G. For any integer
                                            m ≥ 1 invertible in k we have an unramified n!mn -fold covering
                                                πm : {(g, t, xT ) ∈ Grs × T × G/T ; x−1 gx = tm } −
                                                                                                  → Grs , (g, t, xT ) 7→ g.
                                            An irreducible local system E on Grs is said to be admissible if it is a direct
                                            summand of the local system πm! Q̄l for some m as above. The character sheaves
                                            on G are the complexes IC(G, E) for various admissible local systems E on Grs .
                                                We show how the irreducible characters of G(Fq ) can be recovered from charac-
                                            ter sheaves on G. If A is a character sheaf on G then its inverse image F ∗ A under
                                            F is again a character sheaf. There are only finitely many A (up to isomorphism)
                                            such that F ∗ A is isomorphic to A. For any such A we choose an isomorphism

φ : F ∗ A −→ A and we form the characteristic function χA,φ : G(Fq ) −    → Q̄l whose
value at g is the alternating sum of traces of φ on the stalks at g of the cohomology
sheaves of A. Now φ is unique up to a non-zero scalar hence χA,φ is unique up to
a non-zero scalar. It turns out that
   (a) χA,φ is (up to a non-zero scalar) the character of an irreducible represen-
tation of G(Fq ) and A 7→ χA,φ gives a bijection between the set of (isomorphism
classes of ) character sheaves on G that are isomorphic to their inverse image un-
der F and the irreducible characters of G(Fq ).
(This result is essentially contained in [L1,L3].) The main content of this result
is that the (rather complicated) values of an irreducible character of G(Fq ) are
governed by a geometric principle, namely by the procedure which gives the inter-
section cohomology extension of a local system.

2. More generally, assume that G is a connected reductive algebraic group over k.
The definition of the IC(G, E) given above for GLn makes sense also in the general
case. The complexes on G obtained in this way form the class of uniform character
sheaves on G. Consider now a fixed Fq -rational structure on G with Frobenius map
F :G−   → G. The analogue of property 1(a) does not hold in general for (G, F ).
It is still true that the characteristic functions of the uniform character sheaves
that are isomorphic to their inverse image under F are linearly independent class
functions G(Fq ) − → Q̄l . However they do not form a basis of the space of class
functions. Moreover they are in general not irreducible characters of G(Fq ) (up to
a scalar); rather, each of them is a linear combination with known coefficients of a
”small” number of irreducible characters of G(Fq ) (where ”small” means ”bounded
independently of q”); this result is essentially contained in [L1,L3].
   It turns out that the class of uniform character sheaves can be naturally enlarged
to a larger class of complexes on G.
   For any parabolic P of G, UP denotes the unipotent radical of P . For a Borel
B in G, the images under cB : G −       → G/UB of the double cosets BwB form a
partition G/UB = ∪w (BwB/UB ).
   An irreducible intersection cohomology complex A ∈ D(G) is said to be a
character sheaf on G if it is G-equivariant and if for some/any Borel B in G, cB  ! A
has the following property:
   (∗) any cohomology sheaf of this complex restricted to any BwB/UB is a local
system with finite monodromy of order invertible in k.
Then any uniform character sheaf on G is a character sheaf on G. For G = GLn
the converse is also true, but for general G this is not so.
   Consider again a fixed Fq -rational structure on G with Frobenius map F : G −   →
G. The following partial analogue of property 1(a) holds (under a mild restriction
on the characteristic of k).
   (a) The characteristic functions of the various character sheaves A on G (up
                                      ∼
to isomorphism) such that F ∗ A −→ A form a basis of the vector space of class
functions G(Fq ) − → Q̄l .

3. We now fix a parabolic P of G. For any Borel B of P let c̃B : G/UP −    → G/UB
be the obvious map. Now P acts on G/UP by conjugation.
   An irreducible intersection cohomology complex A ∈ D(G/UP ) is said to be
a parabolic character sheaf if it is P -equivariant and if for some/any Borel B in
P , c̃B
      ! A has property 2(∗). When P = G, we recover the definition of character
sheaves on G.
   Consider now a fixed Fq -rational structure on G with Frobenius map F : G − →G
such that P is defined over Fq . Then G/UP has a natural Fq -rational structure
with Frobenius map F . The following generalization of 2(a) holds (under a mild
restriction on the characteristic of k).
   (a) The characteristic functions of the various parabolic character sheaves A on
                                              ∼
G/UP (up to isomorphism) such that F ∗ A −→ A form a basis of the vector space
V of P (Fq )-invariant functions G(Fq )/UP (Fq ) −→ Q̄l .
The proof is given in [L5]. It relies on a generalization of property 2(a) to not
necessarily connected reductive groups which will be contained in the series [L6].
   If h : G(Fq ) −→ Q̄l is the characteristic function of a character sheaf as in
2(a) then by summing h over the fibres of G(Fq ) −   → G(Fq )/UP (Fq ) we obtain a
function h̄ ∈ V. It turns out that each function h̄ is a linear combination of a
”small” number of elements in the basis of V described above. (The fact such a
basis of V exists is not apriori obvious.)
   The parabolic character sheaves on G/UP are expected to be a necessary in-
gredient in establishing the conjectural geometric interpretation of Hecke algebras
with unequal parameters given in [L4].

4. In this section G denotes an abelian group with a given family F of automor-
phisms such that
   (i) if F ∈ F and n ∈ Z>0 , then F n ∈ F;
                                                                           ′
   (ii) if F ∈ F, F ′ ∈ F then there exist n, n′ ∈ Z>0 such that F n = F ′n ;
   (iii) for any F ∈ F, the map G −       → G, x 7→ F (x)x−1 is surjective with finite
kernel.
For F ∈ F and n ∈ Z>0 , the homomorphism
   NF n /F : G − → G, x 7→ xF (x) . . . F n−1 (x),
                                                   n
restricts to a surjective homomorphism GF −          → GF . (If y ∈ GF we can find
                                                                                     n
z ∈ G with y = F (z)z , by (i),(iii). We set x = F (z)z −1 . Then x ∈ GF
                        n   −1

and NF n /F (x) = y.) Let X be the set of pairs (F, ψ) where F ∈ F and ψ ∈
Hom(GF , Q̄∗l ). Consider the equivalence relation on X generated by (F, ψ) ∼
(F n , ψ ◦ NF n /F ). Let G∗ be the set of equivalence classes. We define a group
structure on G∗ . We consider two elements of G∗ ; we represent them in the
form (F, ψ), (F ′, ψ ′ ) where F = F ′ (using (ii)) and we define their product as
the equivalence class of (F, ψψ ′); one checks that this product is independent
of the choices. This makes G∗ into an abelian group. The unit element is the
equivalence class of (F, 1) for any F ∈ F. For F ∈ F we define an automorphism
F ∗ : G∗ −  → G∗ by sending an element of G∗ represented by (F n , ψ) with n ∈

Z>0 , ψ ∈ Hom(GF , Q̄∗l ) to (F n , ψ ◦ F ) (here ψ ◦ F is the composition GF          −→
    n   ψ

Hom(GF , Q̄∗l ) −
                → G∗ , ψ 7→ (F, ψ) is
                                                                     ∗
  (a) a group isomorphism of Hom(GF , Q̄∗l ) onto the subgroup (G∗ )F of G∗ .
                                                   n
(This follows from the surjectivity of NF n /F : GF −→ GF .)
5. Assume now that G is an abelian, connected (affine) algebraic group over k.
We define the notion of character sheaf on G.
     Let F be the set of Frobenius maps F : G −  → G for various rational structures on
G over a finite subfield of k. (These maps are automorphisms of G as an abstract
group.) Then properties 4(i)-4(iii) are satisfied for (G, F) hence the abelian group
G∗ is defined as in §4. We will give an interpretation of G∗ in terms of local
systems on G. Let F ∈ F. Let L : G −          → G be the Lang map x 7→ F (x)x−1 .
Consider the local system E = L! Q̄l on G. Its stalk at y ∈ G is the vector space
Ey consisting of all functions f : L−1 (y) − → Q̄l . We have Ey = ⊕ψ∈Hom(GF ,Q̄∗l ) Eyψ
where
     Eyψ = {f ∈ Ey ; f (zx) = ψ(z)f (x) ∀z ∈ GF , x ∈ L−1 (y)}.
We have a canonical direct sum decomposition E = ⊕ψ E ψ where E ψ is a local
system of rank 1 on G whose stalk at y ∈ G is Eyψ (ψ as above). There is a unique
                                             ∼
isomorphism of local systems φ : F ∗ E ψ −→ E ψ which induces identity on the stalk
at 1. This induces for any y ∈ G the isomorphism EFψ (y) −       → Eyψ given by f 7→ f ′
where f ′ (x) = f (F (x)). If y ∈ GF , this isomorphism is multiplication by ψ(y).
Thus, the characteristic function χE ψ ,φ : GF −    → Q̄l is the character ψ.
                           ′
     Let n ∈ Z>0 . Let L : G −  → G be the map x 7→ F n (x)x−1 . Conider the local
system E ′ = L′! Q̄l on G. Its stalk at y ∈ G is the vector space Ey′ consisting
of all functions f ′ : L′−1 (y) −  → Q̄l . We define Ey −     → Ey′ by f 7→ f ′ where
f ′ (x) = f (NF n ,F x) (note that NF n /F (L′−1 (y)) ⊂ L−1 (y)). This is induced by a
                                                                                 ∼      ′
morphism of local systems E −    → E ′ which restricts to an isomorphism E ψ −→ E ′ψ
                                     n
where ψ ′ = ψ ◦ NF n /F ∈ Hom(GF , Q̄∗l ).
     From the definitions we see that, if ψ, ψ ′ ∈ Hom(GF , Q̄∗l ) then for any y ∈ G
                                      ′ ∼         ′
we have an isomorphism Eyψ ⊗ Eyψ −→ Eyψψ given by multiplication of functions
                                                                              ′ ∼     ′
on L−1 (y). This comes from an isomorphism of local systems E ψ ⊗ E ψ −→ E ψψ .
     A character sheaf on G is by definition a local system of rank 1 on G of the
form E ψ for some (F, ψ) as above. Let S(G) be the set of isomorphism classes
of character sheaves on G. Then S(G) is an abelian group under tensor product.
The arguments above show that (F, ψ) 7→ E ψ defines a (surjective) group homo-
morphism G∗ −    → S(G). This is in fact an isomorphism. (It is enough to show
that, if (F, ψ) is as above and ψ ′ ∈ Hom(GF , Q̄∗l ) is such that the local systems
         ′                                                                         ′
E ψ , E ψ are isomorphic, then ψ = ψ ′ . As we have seen earlier, each of E ψ , E ψ has
a unique isomorphism φ, φ′ with its inverse image under F : G −      → G which induces
the identity at the stalk at 1. Then we must have χE ψ ,φ = χE ψ′ ,φ′ hence ψ = ψ ′ .
Note that for F ∈ F, the map F ∗ : G∗ −     → G∗ corresponds under the isomorphism

    ∼
G∗ −→ S(G) to the map S(G) −     → S(G) given by inverse image under F . Using
this and 4(a), we see that, for F ∈ F, the map Hom(GF , Q̄∗l ) −
                                                               → S(G), ψ 7→ E ψ is
                                 F   ∗
a group isomorphism of Hom(G , Q̄l ) onto the subgroup of S(G) consisting of all
character sheaves on G that are isomorphis to their inverse image under F . We
see that in this case the analogue of 1(a) holds.
   From the definitions, we see that,
   (a) if L1 ∈ S(G) and m : G × G −  → G is the multiplication map then m∗ L1 =
L1 ⊗ L1 .
In the case where G = k, our definition of character sheaves on G reduces to that
of the Artin-Schreier local systems on k.

6. In this section we assume that G is a unipotent algebraic group over k of
”exponential type” that is, such that the exponential map from Lie G to G is well
defined (and an isomorphism of varieties.) In this case we can define character
sheaves on G using Kirillov theory. Namely, for each G-orbit in the dual of Lie G
we consider the local system Q̄l on that orbit extended by 0 on the complement
of the orbit. Taking the Fourier-Deligne transform we obtain (up to shift) an
irreducible intersection cohomology complex on Lie G (since the orbit is smooth
and closed, by Kostant-Rosenlicht). We can view it as an intersection cohomology
complex on G via the exponential map. The complexes on G thus obtained are by
definition the character sheaves of G. Using Kirillov theory (see [K]) we see that
in this case the analogue of 1(a) holds.
   Assume, for example, that G is the group of all matrices
                                                 
                                            1 a b
                              [a, b, c] =  0 1 c 
                                            0 0 1

with entries in k and that 2−1 ∈ k. Consider the following intersection cohomology
complexes on G:
   (i) the complex which on the centre {(0, b, 0); b ∈ k} is the local system E ∈
S(k), E =6 Q̄l wxtended by 0 to the whole of G;
   (ii) the local system f ∗ E where f [a, b, c] = (a, c) and E ∈ S(k2 ).
The complexes (i),(ii) are the character sheaves of G.

7. In this section we assume that G is a connected unipotent algebraic group over
k (not necessarily of exponential type). We expect that in this case there is again
a notion of character sheaf on G such that over a finite field, the characteristic
functions of character sheaves form a basis of the space of class functions and each
characteristic function of a character sheaf is a linear combination of a ”small”
number of irreducible characters. Thus here the situation should be similar to that
for a general connected reductive group rather than that for GLn . We illustrate
this in one example. Assume that k has characteristic 2. Let G be the group

with entries in k; we also write [a, b, c, d] instead of the matrix above. (This group
can be regarded as the unipotent radical of a Borel in Sp4 (k).)
    Let E0 ∈ S(k) be the local system on k associated in §5 to Fq and to the
homomorphism ψ0 : Fq −     → Q̄∗l (composition of the trace Fq −   → F2 and the unique
                                      ∗
injective homomorphism F2 −     → Q̄l ).
    Consider the following intersection cohomology complexes on G:
    (i) the complex which on the centre {[0, b, c, 0]; (b, c) ∈ k2 } is the local system
E ∈ S(k2 ), E 6= Q̄l (see §5) extended by 0 to the whole of G;
    (ii) the complex which on {[a0 , b, c, 0]; (b, c) ∈ k2 } (with a0 ∈ k∗ fixed) is the
local system prc∗ E where E ∈ S(k), E =   6 Q̄l (see §5) extended by 0 to the whole of
G;
    (iii) the complex which on {[0, b, c, d0]; (b, c) ∈ k2 } (with d0 ∈ k∗ fixed) is the
local system f ∗ E0 where f [0, b, c, d0] = αb + α2 d0 c (with α ∈ k∗ fixed) extended
by 0 to the whole of G;
    (iv) the complex which on {[a0 , b, c, d0]; (b, c) ∈ k2 } (with a0 , d0 ∈ k∗ fixed) is
the local system f ∗ E0 where f [a0 , b, c, d0] = a−2   −1
                                                    0 d0 c extended by 0 to the whole
of G;
    (v) the local system f ∗ E on G where f [a, b, c, d] = (a, d) ∈ k2 and E ∈ S(k2 ).
By definition, the character sheaves on G are the complexes in (i)-(v) above.
Note that there are infinitely many subvarieties of G which appear as supports of
character sheaves (this in contrast with the case of reductive groups). There is
a symmetry that exchanges the character sheaves of type (ii) with those of type
(iii). Namely, define ξ : G − → G by

                   [a, b, c, d] 7→ [d, c + ab + a2 d, b2 + dc + abd, a2 ].

Then ξ is a homomorphism whose square is [a, b, c, d] 7→ [a2 , b2 , c2 , d2 ]; moreover,
ξ ∗ interchanges the sets (ii) and (iii) and it leaves stable each of the sets (i), (iv)
and (v).
    Now G has an obvious Fq -structure with Frobenius map F : G −             → G. We
describe the irreducible characters of G(Fq ).
    (I) We have q 2 one dimensional characters U −    → Q̄∗l of the form [a, b, c, d] 7→
ψ0 (xa + yd) (one for each x, y ∈ Fq ).
    (II) We have q − 1 irreducible characters of degree q of the form [0, b, c, 0] 7→
qψ0 (xb) (all other elements are mapped to 0), one for each x ∈ Fq − {0}.
    (III) We have q − 1 irreducible characters of degree q of the form [0, b, c, 0] 7→
qψ0 (xc) (all other elements are mapped to 0), one for each x ∈ Fq − {0}.

    (IV) We have 4(q−1)2 irreducible characters of degree q/2, one for each quadru-
ple (a0 , d0 , ǫ1 , ǫ2 ) where
    a0 ∈ F∗q , d0 ∈ F∗q , ǫ1 ∈ Hom({0, a0 }, ±1), ǫ2 ∈ Hom({0, d0 }, ±1),
namely
    [a, b, c, d] 7→ (q/2)ǫ1 (a)ǫ2 (d)ψ0 (a−2 −1
                                          0 d0 (ba + ba0 + c)),
if a ∈ {0, a0 }, d ∈ {0, d0 }; all other elements are sent to 0.
A character of type (II) is obtained by inducing from the subgroup {[a, b, c, d] ∈
G(Fq ); d = 0} the one dimensional character [a, b, c, 0] 7→ ψ0 (xb) where x ∈ Fq −
{0}. A character of type (III) is obtained by inducing from the commutative
subgroup {[a, b, c, d] ∈ G(Fq ); a = 0} the one dimensional character [0, b, c, d] 7→
ψ0 (xc) where x ∈ Fq − {0}. A character of type (IV) is obtained by inducing from
the subgroup {(a, b, c, d) ∈ G(Fq ); a ∈ {0, a0 }} (where a0 ∈ Fq − {0} is fixed) the
one dimensional character [a, b, c, d] 7→ ǫ1 (a)ψ0 (f d + a−2    −1
                                                            0 d0 (ba + ba0 + c)) where
f ∈ Fq is chosen so that ψ0 (f d0 ) = ǫ2 (d0 ) (the induced character does not depend
on the choice of f ).
    Consider the matrix expressing the characteristic functions of character sheaves
A such that F ∗ A ∼      = A (suitably normalized) in terms of irreducible characters of
G(Fq ). This matrix is square and a direct sum of diagonal blocks of size 1 × 1
(with entry 1) or 4 × 4 with entries ±1/2, representing the Fourier transform over
a two dimensional symplectic F2 -vector space. There are (q − 1)2 blocks of size
4 × 4 involving the irreducible characters of type IV.
    We see that, in our case, the character sheaves have the desired properties. We
also note that in our case, G(Fq ) has some irreducible character whose degree is
not a power of q (but q/2) in contrast with what happens in the situation in §6.
8. Let ǫ be an indeterminate. For r ≥ 2 let Ar = k[ǫ]/(ǫr ). Let G = GLn (Ar ).
Let B (resp.T) be the group of upper triangular (resp. diagonal) matrices in G.
Then G is in a natural way a connected affine algebraic group over k of dimension
n2 r and B, T are closed subgroups of G. On G we have a natural Fq -structure
                                                       (q)
with Frobenius map F : G −       → G, (gij ) 7→ (gij ) where for a0 , a1 , . . . , ar−1 in k we
set (a0 + a1 ǫ + · · · + ar−1 ǫr−1 )(q) = aq0 + aq1 ǫ + · · · + aqr−1 ǫr−1 . The fixed point set of
F :G−  → G is GLn (Fq [ǫ]/(ǫr )). For i 6= j in [1, n], we consider the homomorphism
fij : k −→ T which takes x ∈ k to the diagonal matrix with ii-entry equal to
1 + ǫr−1 x, jj-entry equal to 1 − ǫr−1 x and other diagonal entries equal to 1. Since
T is connected and commutative, the group S(T ) is defined (see §5). Let L ∈ S(T ).
                                                                                                ∗
We will assume that L is regular in the following sense: for any i 6= j in [1, n], fij            L
is not isomorphic to Q̄l .
   Let π : B − → T be the obvious homomorphism. Consider the diagram
                                             a      b

    Y = {(g, xB) ∈ G × G/B; x−1 gx ∈ B}, a(g, xB) = g, b(g, xB) = π(x−1 gx).

Then b∗ L is a local system on Y and we may consider the complex a! b∗ L on G.
   As in §5, we can find an integer m0 > 0 such that, for any m ∈ M =
                                                                                m
{m0 , 2m0 , 3m0 , . . . }, L is associated to (Fq m , ψm ) where ψm ∈ Hom(T F , Q̄∗l ).
We can regard ψm as a character B(Fq m ) −       → Q̄∗l via π : B − → T ; inducing this
from B(Fq m ) to G(Fq m ) we obtain a representation of G(Fq m ) whose character is
denoted by cm . It is easy to see (using the regularity of L) that this character is
irreducible.
                                                               ∼
   For m ∈ M, there is a unique isomorphism (F m )∗ L −→ L of local systems on
T which induces the identity on the stalk of L at 1. This induces an isomorphism
                ∼
(F m )∗ (b∗ L) −→ b∗ L (where F : Y −      → Y is (g, xB) 7→ (F (g), F (x)B)) and an
                                  ∼                               m
isomorphism (F ) (a! b L) −→ a! b L in D(G). Let χm : GF −
                   m ∗      ∗           ∗
                                                                    → Q̄l be the char-
                             ∗
acteristic function of a! b L with respect to this isomorphism. From the definitions
we see that χm = cm . This shows that a! b∗ L behaves like a character sheaf except
for the fact that it is not clear that it is an intersection cohomology complex.
   We conjecture that:
   (a) if L is regular then a! b∗ L is an intersection cohomology complex on G.
(The conjecture also makes sense and is expected to be true when GLn is replaced
by any reductive group, and G by the corresponding group over Ar .) Thus one can
expect that there is a theory of character sheaves for G, as far as generic principal
series representations and their twisted forms is concerned. But one cannot expect
a complete theory of character sheaves in this case (see §13).
   In §9-§12 we prove the conjecture in the special case where G = GL2 (k) and
r = 2.

9. Let A = A2 = k[ǫ]/(ǫ2 ). Let V be a free A-module of rank 2. Let G be
the group of automorphisms of the A-module V . This is the group of all auto-
morphisms of the 4-dimensional k-vector space V that commute with the map
ǫ:V −  → V given by the A-module structure. Hence G is an algebraic group of
dimension 8 over k. Let 0 G̃ be the set of all pairs (g, V2 ) where g ∈ G and V2 is
a free A-submodule of V of rank 1 such that gV2 = V2 . For k = 1, 2, let Xk be
the set of all A-submodules of V that have dimension k as a k-vector space. Let
G̃ be the set of all triples (g, V1 , V2 ) where g ∈ G, V1 ∈ X1 , V2 ∈ X2 , V1 ⊂ V2 ,
gV1 = V1 , gV2 = V2 and the scalars by which g acts on V1 and V2 /V1 coincide. We
can regard 0 G̃ as a subset of G̃ by (g, V2) 7→ (g, ǫV2 , V2 ). Note that G̃ is naturally
an algebraic variety over k and 0 G̃ is an open subset of G̃.
    The group of units A′ of A is an algebraic group isomorphic to k∗ × k. Hence
S(A′ ) is defined. Let L1 ∈ S(S ′ ), L2 ∈ S(S ′ ). Let L = L1 ⊠ L2 ∈ S(A′ × A′ ),
E = L2 ⊗ L∗1 ∈ S(A′ ). Define f : 0 G̃ −      → A′ × A′ by f (g, V2 ) = (α1 , α2 ) where
α1 ∈ A is given by gv = α1 v for v ∈ V2 and α2 ∈ A′ is given by gv ′ = α2 v ′ for
         ′

v ′ ∈ V /V2 . Let L̃ = f ∗ (L1 ⊠ L2 ), a local system on 0 G̃. Define fi : 0 G̃ −  → A′
(i = 1, 2) by f1 (g, V2 ) = α1 α2 , f2 (g, V2 ) = α1 where α1 , α2 are as above. Then
L̃ = f1∗ L1 ⊗ f2∗ L. (We use 5(a).)
    We shall assume that L is regular in the following sense: the restriction of E to
                    CHARACTER SHEAVES AND GENERALIZATIONS                                       9

the subgroup T = {1 + ǫc; c ∈ k} of A′ is not isomorphic to Q̄l .
Lemma 10. (a) G̃ is an irreducible, smooth variety and G̃ − 0 G̃ is a smooth
irreducible hypersurface in G̃.
   (b) We have IC(G̃, L̃)|G̃−0 G̃ = 0.
     Note that f1 : 0 G̃ − → A′ extends to the whole of G̃ by f1 (g, V1 , V2 ) = detA (g :
V −  → V ). Hence f1∗ L1 extends to a local system on G̃ and we have IC(G̃, L̃) =
f1 L1 ⊗ IC(G̃, f2∗ E). Hence to prove (b) it is enough to show that IC(G̃, f2∗ E) is
  ∗

zero on G̃ − 0 G̃.
                                                              → X1 (resp. G̃ − 0 G̃ −
     Let Z (resp. H) be the fibre of the second projection G̃ −                        →
X1 ) at V1 ∈ X1 . Since G acts transitively on X1 it is enough to show that Z is
smooth, irreducible, H is a smooth, irreducible hypersurface in Z and IC(Z, f2∗ E)
is zero on H (the restriction of f2 to Z is denoted again by f2 ).
     Let e1 , e2 be a basis of V such that V1 = kǫe1 . The subspaces V2 ∈ X2 such
                                                  ′ ′′
that V1 ⊂ V2 are exactly the subspaces V2z ,z = kǫe1 + k(z ′ e1 + z ′′ ǫe2 ) where
(z ′ , z ′′ ) ∈ k2 − {0}. An element g ∈ G is of the form

                             ge1 = a0 e1 + b0 e2 + a1 ǫe1 + b1 ǫe2 ,
                             ge2 = c0 e1 + d0 e2 + c1 ǫe1 + d1 ǫe2

where ai , bi , ci , di ∈ k satisfy a0 d0 − b0 c0 6= 0.
                                                                                ′ ′′     ′ ′′
   The condition that gǫe1 ∈ kǫe1 is b0 = 0. The condition that gV2z ,z = V2z ,z
is that z ′ b1 + z ′′ d0 = a0 z ′′ if z ′ 6= 0 (no condition if z ′ = 0). The condition that
                                                    ′ ′′
the scalars by which g acts on V1 and V2z ,z /V1 coincide is a0 = d0 if z ′ = 0 (no
condition if z ′ 6= 0).
   We see that we may identify Z with

         {(a0 , c0 , d0 , a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 ; z ′ , z ′′ ) ∈ k7 × (k2 − {0})/k∗ ;
                                                  a0 6= 0, d0 6= 0, z ′ b1 = z ′′ (a0 − d0 )}

and H with the subset defined by z ′ = 0. In this description it is clear that Z is
irreducible, smooth and H is a smooth, irreducible hypersurface in Z. The function
f2 takes a point with z ′ 6= 0 to a0 + ǫ(a1 + z ′′ z ′−1 c0 ). To prove the statement on
intersection cohomology we may replace Z by the open subset z ′′ 6= 0 containing
H. Thus we may replace Z by

     Z1 = {(a0 , c0 , d0 , a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 ; z) ∈ k7 × k; a0 6= 0, d0 6= 0, zb1 = a0 − d0 }

and H by the subset defined by z = 0. The function f2 is defined on Z1 − H by

                    a0 + ǫ(a1 + z −1 c0 ) = (a0 + ǫa1 )(1 + ǫz −1 c0 a−1
                                                                      0 ).

Thus f2 = f3 f4 where f3 (resp. f4 ) is defined on Z1 − H by a0 + ǫa1 (resp.
1 +ǫz −1 c0 a−1          ∗      ∗     ∗                                ∗
             0 ). Hence f2 E = f3 E ⊗f4 E. Now f3 extends to Z1 hence f3 E extends
10                                       G. LUSZTIG

to a local system on Z1 . We have IC(Z1 , f3∗ E ⊗ f4∗ E) = f3∗ E ⊗ IC(Z1 , f4∗ E). It is
enough to show that IC(Z1 , f4∗ E) is zero on H. We make the change of variable
c = c0 a−1
        0 . Then Z1 becomes

            Z1 = {(a0 , c, a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 ; z) ∈ k7 × k; a0 6= 0, a0 − zb1 6= 0},
H is the subset defined by z = 0 and f4 : Z1 − H −             → A′ is given by 1 + ǫz −1 c.
                                              7
Let Z̃1 = {(a0 , c, a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 ; z) ∈ k × k} and let H1 be the subset of Z̃1 defined
by z = 0. Then Z1 is open in Z̃1 and f4 is well defined on Z̃1 − H1 by 1 + ǫz −1 c.
Hence f4∗ E is well defined on Z̃1 − H1 . It is enough to show that IC(Z̃1 , f4∗ E)
is zero on H1 . Let H ′ = {(c, z) ∈ k2 ; z = 0} and define f ′ : k2 − H ′ −        → A′ by
f ′ (c, z) = 1 + ǫz −1 c. It is enough to show that IC(k2 , f ′∗ E) is zero on H ′ . Let P
be the projective line associate to k2 . Then H ′ defines a point x0 ∈ P . Since f ′ is
constant on lines, it defines a map h : P − {x0 } −        → A′ . Since P is 1-dimensional
we have IC(P, h∗ E) = F where F is a constructible sheaf on P whose restriction
to P − {x0 } is h∗ E. It is enough to show that
     (c) the stalk of F at x0 is 0;
     (d) H i (P, F ) = 0 for i = 0, 1.
(Indeed, (c) implies that IC(k2 , f ′∗ E) is zero at (c, 0) with c 6= 0 and (d) implies
that IC(k2 , f ′∗ E) is zero at (0, 0).)
     Consider the standard Fq -rational structures an k2 , X, A′ and let F be the
corresponding Frobenius map. We may assume that E is associated as in §5 to
(Fq , ψ) where ψ ∈ Hom(A′F , Q̄∗l ). For any m ∈ Z>0 there is a unique isomorphism
                    ∼
φm : (F m )∗ E −→ E which induces the identity on the stalk of E at 1. The char-
acteristic function of E with respect to this isomorphism is a′ 7→ ψ(NF m /F (a′ )),
             m
a′ ∈ A′F . Since, by assumption, E|T is not isomorphic to Q̄l , ψ|T F is not the
                                                  m                              m
trivial character. Hence ψ ◦ NF m /F : A′F −         → Q̄∗l is non-trivial on T F . Now φm
                                                   ∼
inducesPan isomorphism φ′m : (F m )∗ h∗ E −→ h∗ E. We show that
     (e) x∈P F m −{x0 } tr(φ′m , (h∗ E)x ) = 0.
AnP   equivalent statement is:
                                                −1
        (c,z)∈Fq m ×F∗m (ψ ◦ NF m /F )(1 + ǫz
                  q
                                                   c) = 0,
                                                          m                               m
which follows from the fact that ψ ◦ NF m /F : A′F −    → Q̄∗l is non-trivial on T F .
Introducing (e) in the trace formula for Frobenius, we see that
      P2
   (f) i=0 (−1)i tr(φ′m , H i (P, F )) = tr(φ′m , Fx0 )
where Fx0 is the talk of F at x0 and φ′m is in fact equal to φ′1 m (for m = 1, 2, 3, . . . ).
By Deligne’s purity theorem, H i (P, F ) together with φ′1 is pure of weight i; by
Gabber’s theorem [BBD], Fx0 together with φ′1 is mixed of weight ≤ 0. Hence from
(f) we deduce that H 1 (P, F ) = 0, H 2 (P, F ) = 0 and dim H 0 (P, F ) = dim Fx0 . By
the hard Lefschetz theorem [BBD] we have dim H 0 (P, F ) = dim H 2 (P, F ). It
follows that H 0 (P, F ) = 0 hence Fx0 = 0. This proves (c),(d). The lemma is
proved.
Lemma 11. Define ρ : 0 G̃ − → G by (g, V2 ) 7→ g. Let K = ρ! L̃. Let G0 be the
open dense subset of G consisting of all g ∈ G such that g : ǫV −
                                                                → ǫV is regular,

semisimple. Let ρ0 : ρ−1 (G0 ) −
                               → G0 be the restriction of ρ. Then ρ0! L̃ is a local
system on G0 . We have dim suppHi K < dim G − i for any i > 0.
   The first assertion of the lemma follows from the fact that ρ0 is a double cover-
ing. To prove the second assertion it is enough to show that, for i > 0, the set Gi
consisting of the points g ∈ G such that dim ρ−1 (g) = i and ⊕j Hcj (ρ−1 (g), L̃) 6= 0
has codimension > 2i in G.
   Consider the fibre ρ−1 (g) for g ∈ G. We may assume that, with respect to       a
                                                                                      ab
suitable A-basis of V , g can be represented as an upper triangular matrix            0 c
with a, c in A′ and b ∈ A. (Otherwise, ρ−1 (g) is empty.) There are five cases:
   Case 1. a − d ∈ A′ . Then ρ−1 (g) consists of two points.
   Case 2. a − d ∈ ǫA, b ∈ A′ . Then ρ−1 (g) is an affine line.
   Case 3. a − d ∈ ǫA − {0}, b ∈ ǫA. Then ρ−1 (g) is a disjoint union of two affine
lines.
   Case 4. a = d, b ∈ ǫA − {0}. Then ρ−1 (g) is an affine line.
   Case 5. a = d, b = 0. Then ρ−1 (g) is an affine line bundle over a projective
line.
In case 2, we may identify ρ−1 (g), L̃|ρ−1 (g) with P − {x0 }, F |P −{x0 } in the proof of
Lemma 10. Then the argument in that proof shows that Hcj (ρ−1 (g), L̃) = 0 for all
j. We see that G1 consists of all g as in case 3 and 4, hence G1 has codimension
3 in G. We see that G2 consists of all g as in case 5, hence G2 has codimension 6
in G. The lemma is proved. Note that without the assumption that L is regular,
the last assertion of the lemma would not hold (there would be a violation coming
from g in case 2.)
12. We show:
(a)                               ρ! L̃ = IC(G, ρ0! L̃).
Define ρ̃ : G̃ −  → G by ρ̃(g, V1 , V2 ) = g. Clearly, ρ̃ is proper. Let j : 0 G̃ −→ G
be the inclusion. We have ρ = ρ̃ ◦ j hence ρ! L̃ = ρ̃! (j! L̃). By Lemma 10, we
have j! L̃ = IC(G̃, L̃) hence ρ! L̃ = ρ̃! IC(G̃, L̃). Since ρ̃ is proper, ρ̃! commutes
with the Verdier duality D. Hence D(ρ! L̃) = ρ̃! DIC(G̃, L̃). Hence D(ρ! L̃) equals
ρ̃! IC(G̃, L̃∗ ) up to a shift. Now the same argument that shows j! L̃ = IC(G̃, L̃)
shows also j! L̃∗ = IC(G̃, L̃∗ ). Hence, up to shift, D(ρ! L̃) equals ρ̃! j! L̃∗ = ρ! L̃∗ .
Now the argument in Lemma 12 can also be applied to L̃∗ instead of L̃ and yields
dim suppHi ρ! L̃∗ < dim G − i for any i > 0. Thus, ρ! L̃ satisfies the defining
properties of IC(G, ρ0! L̃) hence it is equal to it. This proves (a).
     We see that conjecture 8(a) holds for n = 2, r = 2.
13. If G is a connected affine algebraic group over k which is neither reductive
nor nilpotent, one cannot expect to have a complete theory character sheaves for
G. Assume for example that G is the group of all matrices
                                           
                                  [a, b] = a0 1b

with entries in k. The group G(Fq ) (for the obvious Fq -rational structure) has
(q − 1) one dimensional representations and one (q − 1)-dimensional irreducible
representation. The character of a one dimensional representation can be real-
ized in terms of an intersection cohomology complex (a local system on G), but
that of the (q − 1) dimensional irreducible representation appears as a difference
of two intersection cohomology complexes, one given by the local system Q̄l on
the unipotent radical of G and one supported by the unit element of G. A sim-
ilar phenomenon occurs for G as in §9 and for a (q 2 − 1)-dimensional irreducible
representation of G(Fq ).
