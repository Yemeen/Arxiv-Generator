                                                     Abstract. In this paper, it is shown that the projectivity of a rational module
                                                     for an infinitesimal unipotent group scheme over an algebraically closed field
                                                     of positive characteristic can be detected on a family of closed subgroups.



                                                Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0 and G be an infinites-
                                             imal group scheme over k, that is an affine group scheme G over k whose coordinate
                                             (Hopf) algebra k[G] is a finite-dimensional local k-algebra. A rational G-module
                                             is equivalent to a k[G]-comodule and further equivalent to a module for the finite-
                                             dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra k[G]∗ ≡ Homk (k[G], k). Since k[G]∗ is
                                             a Frobenius algebra (cf. [Jan]), a rational G-module (even infinite-dimensional) is
                                             in fact projective if and only if it is injective (cf. [FW]). Further, for any rational
                                             G-module M and any closed subgroup scheme H ⊂ G, if M is projective over G,
                                             then it remains projective upon restriction to H (cf. [Jan]). We consider the ques-
                                             tion of whether there is a “nice” collection of closed subgroups of G upon which
                                             projectivity (over G) can be detected.
                                                For an example of what we mean by a “nice” collection, consider the situation
                                             of modules over a finite group. Over a field of characteristic p > 0, a module over
                                             a finite group is projective if and only if it is projective upon restriction to a p-
                                             Sylow subgroup (cf. [Rim]). For a p-group (and hence for any finite group), L.
                                             Chouinard [Ch] showed that a module is projective if and only if it is projective
                                             upon restriction to every elementary abelian subgroup. If the module is assumed
                                             to be finite-dimensional, this result follows from the theory of varieties for finite
                                             groups (cf. [Ca] or [Ben]). Indeed, elementary abelian subgroups play an essential
                                             role in this theory.
                                                In work of A. Suslin, E. Friedlander, and the author [SFB1], [SFB2], a theory of
                                             varieties for infinitesimal group schemes was developed. In this setting, subgroups of
                                             the form Ga(r) (the rth Frobenius kernel of the additive group scheme Ga ) play the
                                             role analogous to that of elementary abelian subgroups in the case of finite groups.
                                             Not surprisingly then, for finite-dimensional modules, one obtains the following
                                             analogue of Chouinard’s Theorem.

                                             Proposition 1 ([SFB2, Proposition 7.6]). Let k be an algebraically closed field of
                                             characteristic p > 0, r > 0 be an integer, G be an infinitesimal group scheme over
                                             k of height ≤ r, and M be a finite-dimensional rational G-module. Then M is
                                             projective as a rational G-module if and only if whenever H ⊂ G is a subgroup
                                             scheme isomorphic to Ga(s) (with s ≤ r) the restriction of M to H is projective as
                                             a rational H-module.

    Under some stronger hypotheses, E. Cline, B. Parshall, and L. Scott had previ-
ously shown that it suffices to consider a much smaller collection of subgroups (cf.
[CPS, Main Theorem]). More precisely, their result applies to a group scheme G
of the form N(r) (the rth Frobenius kernel of N ) where N is a connected (reduced)
T -stable subgroup scheme of a connected, semisimple algebraic group scheme over
k (and T is a maximal torus). If M is a finite-dimensional N(r) T -module (i.e. M is
an N(r) -module which admits a compatible T -structure), then the projectivity of
M may be detected by taking only those subgroup schemes of the form H = Uα(r)
for each root subgroup Uα ⊂ N . However, this result does not hold in general
for infinite-dimensional modules (cf. [CPS, Example (3.2)]), whereas Chouinard’s
Theorem for finite groups does.
    The goal of this paper is to show that Proposition 1 also holds for infinite-
dimensional modules if G is assumed to be unipotent. (An affine group scheme G
is said to be unipotent if it admits an embedding as a closed subgroup of Un , the
subgroup scheme in GLn of strictly upper triangular matrices, for some postive
integer n.) Although unnecessary for Chouinard’s Theorem, to handle arbitrary
modules, we need a slightly stronger hypothesis. Indeed, consider the case that
G is isomorphic to a product G×n  a(1) of height one additive group schemes. As an
algebra, k[G]∗ is isomorphic to the group algebra of an elementary abelian p-group
and the desired theorem becomes equivalent to Dade’s Lemma [Dade] which says
that a kΠ-module for an elementary abelian p-group Π is projective if and only
if it is projective upon restriction to every “cyclic shifted subroup”. This result
was originally proved for finite-dimensional modules and D. Benson, J. Carlson,
and J. Rickard [BCR2] observe that one must consider a larger field in order for
Dade’s Lemma to hold in general. As such, we must also consider field extensions.
Specifically, in Section 2, we prove the following theorem using some of the ideas
in [SFB2] and an argument similar to that of Chouinard [Ch] without appealing
to the theory of varieties.

Theorem. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0, r > 0 be
an integer, and G be an infinitesimal unipotent group scheme over k of height ≤ r.
For any rational G-module M , M is projective as a rational G-module if and only
if for every field extension K/k and every (closed) K-subgroup scheme H ⊂ G⊗k K
with H ≃ Ga(s) ⊗k K (with s ≤ r) the restriction of M ⊗k K to H is projective as
a rational H-module.

   The essential property of a unipotent group scheme is that the trivial module
k is the only simple module or equivalently that HomG (k, M ) = M G 6= 0 for
all non-zero rational G-modules M . (Indeed, this property is sometimes taken as
the definition of a unipotent group scheme.) Observe that the theory of finite-
dimensional algebras shows that if k is the only simple module for such an algebra,
then the algebra is indecomposable as a module over itself, and hence a module is
in fact projective if and only if it is free. Hence, over an infinitesimal unipotent
group scheme, the notions of projective, injective, and free are all equivalent.
   In the sense of these properties, infinitesimal unipotent group schemes are ana-
logues of finite p-groups. For finite groups, the key to reducing the projectivity
of a G-module to the case of a p-group is that the restriction map in cohomology
induced by the embedding of a p-Sylow subgroup is an injection. Unfortunately,
there is no analogous result in the setting of group schemes.
                  PROJECTIVITY FOR UNIPOTENT GROUP SCHEMES                            3


   We remind the reader that the restricted representation theory of a restricted Lie
algebra g over k is equivalent to the representation theory of a certain (height 1)
infinitesimal group scheme (cf. [Jan]). As such, the theorem applies to p-nilpotent
restricted Lie algebras, which may be embedded in a Lie algebra of strictly upper
triangular matrices, and may be stated as follows.
Corollary. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0, g be a
finite-dimensional, p-nilpotent restricted Lie algebra over k, and M be a u(g)-
module, where u(g) denotes the restricted enveloping algebra of g. Then M is
projective over u(g) if and only if for every field extension K/k, M is projective
upon restriction to each subalgebra u(hxi) ⊂ u(g ⊗k K) for all x ∈ g ⊗k K with
x[p] = 0, where hxi ⊂ g ⊗k K denotes the one-dimensional restricted Lie subalgebra
of g ⊗k K spanned by x, and x[p] denotes the image of x under the restriction map
on g ⊗k K.
   In this context, the result of Cline, Parshall, and Scott asserts that it suffices to
consider only those elements x which are root vectors. Consider the two-dimensional
nilpotent Lie subalgebra g = hxα , xα+β i ⊂ sl3 generated by root vectors, where α
and β are the simple roots. In Example (3.2) of [CPS], they exhibit an infinite-
dimensional non-projective g-module M which is free upon restriction to the root
vectors xα and xα+β ; contradicting an infinite-dimensional version of their result.
On the other hand, the interested reader can readily check that this module M is
not free upon restriction to the element x = cxα + dxα+β whenever c, d ∈ k are
both non-zero and hence does not contradict the corollary.
   Before turning to the proof, we note one potential application of the theorem (or
preferably a generalization of it to arbitrary infinitesimal group schemes). Recently
D. Benson, J. Carlson, and J. Rickard [BCR1], [BCR2] have developed a theory
of varieties for infinitely generated modules over finite groups. While Chouinard’s
Theorem for finite-dimensional modules follows from the theory of varieties, it turns
out that knowing Chouinard’s Theorem in advance for arbitrary modules is neces-
sary for certain results in the more general theory. Hence, an attempt to generalize
the theory of varieties to arbitrary modules for infinitesimal group schemes may in
part require the above theorem.

                              1. Cohomology Facts
   In this section, we record two results about cohomology which will be used in
the next section to prove the theorem. First, the following well known fact relates
projectivity to vanishing of cohomology for unipotent group schemes. Indeed, the
reader will readily observe that this result holds for modules over an arbitrary
finite-dimensional k-algebra which admits k as the only simple module and has the
property that the notions of injective and projective are equivalent.
Proposition 2. Let k be a field of characteristic p > 0 and G be an infinitesimal
unipotent group scheme over k. For any rational G-module M , M is projective (=
injective = free) if and only if H 1 (G, M ) = 0.

   To prove Proposition 2, we need to consider a minimal injective resolution I∗ for
M . Any rational G-module M has a unique up to isomorphism injective hull QM
such that soc QM ≃ soc M (cf. [Jan, I 3.17]). We can form as usual an injective
resolution of M :
                                  δ0    δ1
                               I0 →  I1 →   I2 → · · ·
by taking I0 = QM and inductively In to be the injective hull of In−1 / im δn−2 and
δn−1 : In−1 ։ In−1 / im δn−2 ֒→ In (with I−1 ≡ M and δ−1 : M ֒→ QM ). Evidently
we have In−1 / im δn−2 ≃ im δn−1 = ker δn .
Lemma 1 (cf. [Ben, I 2.5.4]). Let I∗ be the minimal injective resolution of M con-
structed above. Then the differential in the complex HomG (k, I∗ ) is trivial and hence
we have H i (G, M ) = HomG (k, Ii ) = IiG for all i ≥ 0.
Proof. Consider δi : Ii → Ii+1 for any i ≥ 0 and let α : k → Ii be a nonzero map.
We want to show that δi ◦ α = 0. Since α is a nonzero map and k is simple, α is in
fact injective and so α(k) is a simple submodule of Ii . Hence, α(k) is contained in
the socle of Ii . By construction, soc Ii = soc(ker δi ) ⊂ ker δi . Hence, α(k) ⊂ ker δi .
In other words, δi ◦ α = 0 as claimed.
    Using Lemma 1, we now prove Proposition 2.
Proof of Proposition 2. If M is projective, then clearly H i (G, M ) = 0 for all i > 0.
Conversely, suppose that H 1 (G, M ) = 0 and let I∗ be a minimal injective resolution
of M as above. Lemma 1 shows in particular that H 1 (G, M ) = I1G and hence
I1G = 0. Since G is unipotent, the G-fixed points of every non-zero module are non-
zero. Hence, we must have I1 = 0. But, that means M was injective (equivalently
projective) to begin with.
   In the proof of the theorem, we will also need to make use of the structure of the
cohomology algebra of Ga(1) , which is simply the same as the cohomology algebra
of the finite cyclic group Z/p.
Proposition 3 ([CPSvdK]). If p 6= 2, then the cohomology algebra H ∗ (Ga(1) , k)
is the tensor product of a polynomial algebra k[x1 ] in one generator x1 of degree
2 and an exterior algebra Λ(λ1 ) in one generator λ1 of degree 1. If p = 2, then
H ∗ (Ga(1) , k) = k[λ1 ] is a polynomial algebra in one generator λ1 of degree 1 (and
in this case we set x1 = λ21 ).

                               2. Proof of Theorem
   We now proceed to prove the theorem. If M is projective as a rational G-module,
then M ⊗k K is projective over G ⊗k K and, as already noted, remains so upon
restriction to H. Conversely, suppose all restrictions are projective. Let k ′ /k be any
(even trivial) algebraically closed field extension, G′ = G ⊗k k ′ , and M ′ = M ⊗k k ′ .
Clearly for any field extension K/k ′ and K-subgroup scheme H ⊂ G′ ⊗k′ K with
H ≃ Ga(s) ⊗k k ′ ⊗k′ K the restriction of M ′ ⊗k′ K to H is projective as a rational
H-module.
   We proceed by induction on dimk′ k ′ [G′ ] to show the slightly stronger statment
that M ′ is projective over G′ for any such k ′ . If dimk′ k ′ [G′ ] = 1, G′ is the trivial
group scheme and there is nothing to prove. So, assume now that the result holds
for any k ′ and any H ⊂ G′ with dimk′ k ′ [H] < dimk′ k ′ [G′ ]. If G′ ≃ Ga(s) ⊗k k ′ for
some s ≤ r, then we are done by assumption.
                    PROJECTIVITY FOR UNIPOTENT GROUP SCHEMES                                     5


   So, we may assume from now on that G′ 6≃ Ga(s) ⊗k k ′ . By Proposition 2, to
show that M ′ is projective over G′ , it suffices to show that H 1 (G′ , M ′ ) = 0. Let
φ : G′ ։ G′a(1) = Ga(1) ⊗k k ′ be any non-trivial homomorphism of group schemes.
(As G is unipotent, there exists at least one such homomorphism.) Consider the
short exact sequence of group schemes over k ′
                                 1 → N → G′ → G′a(1) → 1
and the induced Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence
                  E2p,q (M ′ ) = H p (G′a(1) , H q (N, M ′ )) ⇒ H p+q (G′ , M ′ ).
Now, φ induces a map on cohomology φ∗ : H ∗ (G′a(1) , k ′ ) → H ∗ (G′ , k ′ ). Let
xφ = φ∗ (x1 ) where x1 ∈ H 2 (G′a(1) , k ′ ) is the canonical generator. Furthermore,
the spectral sequence admits an action of the cohomology ring H ∗ (G′a(1) , k ′ ), with
H ∗ (G′a(1) , k ′ ) acting on the abutment via φ∗ .
   Since φ is non-trivial, dimk′ k ′ [N ] < dimk′ k ′ [G′ ] and so by induction M ′ is
projective upon restriction to N . Thus, H i (N, M ′ ) = 0 for all i > 0 and the
spectral sequence collapses to
                         E2p,0 = H p (G′a(1) , (M ′ )N ) ⇒ H p (G′ , M ′ )
giving an isomorphism H ∗ (G′a(1) , (M ′ )N ) ≃ H ∗ (G′ , M ′ ). We now recall that the
action of x1 induces a periodicity isomorphism H i (G′a(1) , Q) ≃ H i+2 (G′a(1) , Q) for
all i > 0 and any rational G′a(1) -module Q (cf. [SFB2, 2.3]). Hence, the action of
xφ ∈ H 2 (G′ , k ′ ) also induces a periodicity isomorphism H i (G′ , M ′ ) ≃ H i+2 (G′ , M ′ )
for all i > 0.
   We consider the following two cases.
CASE I: dimk′ HomGr/k′ (G′ , G′a(1) ) = 1
   By Theorem 1.6 of [SFB2] (which is an analogue of a characterization of p-
groups in terms of cohomology by J.-P. Serre [Se]), xφ ∈ H 2 (G′ , k ′ ) is nilpotent
and so we conclude from the above periodicity isomorphism that H 1 (G′ , M ′ ) = 0
and hence M ′ is projective.
CASE II: dimk′ HomGr/k′ (G′ , G′a(1) ) > 1
   Let φ1 and φ2 be two linearly independent homomorphisms from G′ onto G′a(1) .
Further, let c1 , c2 ∈ k ′ . Then, by Corollary 1.5 of [SFB2],
           c1 xφ1 + c2 xφ2 = xc1/p φ1 + xc1/p φ2 = xc1/p φ1 +c1/p φ2 ∈ H 2 (G′ , k ′ ).
                                  1          2            1       2

                                                     1/p     1/p
If at least one of c1 , c2 is non-zero, the map     c1 φ1 + c2 φ2    : G′ → G′a(1) is non-zero
and so the action of c1 xφ1 + c2 xφ2 induces a periodicity isomorphism H i (G′ , M ′ ) ≃
                                                                                 ∼
H i+2 (G′ , M ′ ) for all i > 0. In particular, c1 xφ1 +c2 xφ2 : H 1 (G′ , M ′ ) → H 3 (G′ , M ′ ).
              1     ′    ′
Hence, if H (G , M ) was a finite-dimensional space, then one would readily con-
clude from an eigenvalue argument that H 1 (G′ , M ′ ) = 0. Since H 1 (G′ , M ′ ) might
be infinite-dimensional (as M ′ might be), we make use of an infinite-dimensional
substitute used in [BCR2]. For the reader’s convenience, we restate this result
here.
Lemma 2 ([BCR2, Lemma 4.1]). Let V and W be vector spaces over an alge-
braically closed field k and K be a non-trivial field extension of k. Suppose that
φ1 , φ2 : V → W are linear maps with the property that for every pair of scalars
6                                CHRISTOPHER P. BENDEL


c1 , c2 ∈ K, not both zero, the linear map c1 φ1 + c2 φ2 : V ⊗k K → W ⊗k K is an
isomorphism. Then both V and W are the zero vector space.
   Continuing with the proof of the theorem, let K/k ′ be any non-trivial alge-
braically closed field extension. Consider the base changes of G′ and M ′ to K:
GK ≡ G′ ⊗k′ K and MK ≡ M ′ ⊗k′ K. Then we have H ∗ (G′ , k ′ )⊗k′ K ≃ H ∗ (GK , K)
and H ∗ (G′ , M ′ ) ⊗k′ K ≃ H ∗ (GK , MK ). Further, since φ1 and φ2 remain linearly
independent after base change, for any c1 , c2 ∈ K with at least one non-zero, the
map c1 φ1 + c2 φ2 : GK → G′a(1) ⊗k′ K is non-trivial. Since our inductive assumption
applies to any algebraically closed field extension of k, it also applies to K and so
as above we may conclude that
                                                                ∼
          c1 xφ1 + c2 xφ2 = xc1/p φ1 +c1/p φ2 : H 1 (GK , MK ) → H 3 (GK , MK ).
                                1       2

Hence, applying Lemma 2 to K/k ′ , we again conclude that H 1 (G′ , M ′ ) = 0 and so
M ′ is projective over G′ and the proof is complete.
