                                                Let G be a reductive algebraic group over the complex numbers, B a Borel subgroup of
                                             G, and T a maximal torus of B. We denote by Λ = Λ(G) the weight lattice of G with
                                             respect to T , and by Λ+ = Λ+ (G) the set of dominant weights with respect to the positive
                                             roots defined by B. Let g be the Lie algebra of G, and let N denote the nilpotent cone in g.
                                                Now, let e ∈ N be a nilpotent element, and let Oe be the orbit of e in g under the adjoint
                                             action of G. We write Ge for the centralizer of e in G. Let No denote the set of nilpotent
                                             orbits in g, and No,r the set of G-conjugacy classes of pairs
                                                         {(e, τ ) | e ∈ N and τ an irreducible rational representation of Ge }.
                                                Lusztig [9] conjectured the existence of a bijection No,r ↔ Λ+ using his work on cells
                                             in affine Weyl groups. From the point of view of Harish-Chandra modules, Vogan also
                                             conjectured a bijection between No,r and Λ+ . Such a bijection has been established by
                                             Bezrukavnikov in two preprints (the bijections in each preprint are conjecturally the same)
                                             [2], [3]. Bezrukavnikov’s second bijection is closely related to Ostrik’s conjectural descrip-
                                             tion of the bijection [12] (see also [4]). In the case of G = GL(n, C), the first author
                                             [1] described an explicit combinatorial bijection between No,r and Λ+ from the Harish-
                                             Chandra module perspective. At present, it is not known how all of these bijections are
                                             related (Bezrukavnikov’s two candidates; Ostrik’s conjectural candidate; and the first au-
                                             thor’s candidate in type A). In this paper, we work in the context of [1], which we now
                                             review.
                                                Let KG (N ) denote the Grothendieck group of G-equivariant coherent sheaves on N .
                                             On the one hand, KG (N ) has a natural basis indexed by elements of Λ+ , denoted AJ(λ)
                                             in [12] (but unlike in [12], we are not utilizing the C∗ action on N here). The algebraic
                                             global sections of AJ(λ) are isomorphic as a G-module to IndG   T λ. Thus, the space of global
                                             sections of any element F ∈ KG (N ) is given as a G-module by a unique expression of the
                                             form
                                                                                          X

                                             us by Vogan.)
                                               Let us now fix a pair (e, τ ) ∈ No,r . We want to consider all elements F ∈ KG (N ) whose
                                             support is contained in Oe , and whose restriction to Oe is the vector bundle arising from τ .

For each such F, there is at least one λ of maximal length occurring in the expression (1)
(where we have fixed a W -invariant positive-definite symmetric bilinear form on the real
span of Λ, so that we can speak of the length of a weight of G). Define γ : No,r → Λ+ by
             γ(e, τ ) = the smallest such largest λ, over all possible choices of F .
The following conjecture was made in [1]; moreover, it was proved in the case of G =
GL(n, C) in op. cit.
Conjecture 1.1 ([1]). The map γ is well-defined and is a bijection. Moreover, there is a
basis {M (e, τ )} for KG (N ), indexed by No,r , such that
    1. the support of M (e, τ ) is Oe ,
    2. the restriction of M (e, τ ) to Oe is the locally free sheaf arising from τ , and
    3. there is an upper-triangular relationship between this basis and the one indexed by Λ+ :
                                                              X
                     Γ(N , M (e, τ )) = ± IndGT γ(e, τ ) +          mµ IndG T µ.

   In this paper, we study the problem of computing γ when τ gives rise to a local system
on Oe (for semisimple groups, this means that τ is trivial on the identity component of Ge ).
Let us denote by Λloc+ the image of γ when τ corresponds to a local system.
   Here is an outline of the paper. In section 2, we compute Λloc
                                                                + explicitly for G = GL(n).
In section 3, we state a precise conjecture, for general G, that the Dynkin weights for the
Langlands dual group of G are a subset of Λloc  + . In section 4, we show how to associate
to γ(e, τ ) a sub-bundle of the cotangent bundle of G/B. Then for GL(n), we are able to
prove that when e is in a fixed nilpotent orbit, the cohomology of the sub-bundles (with
coefficients in the structure sheaf) are independent of the local system τ .

                     2. Computing γ for a local system in GL(n)
   For a partition d of n, let Od denote the nilpotent orbit in gl(n) indexed by d. If
d = [k1a1 , k2a2 , . . . , klal ], then we know that π1 (Od ) ≃ Z/cZ, where c is the greatest common
divisor of the ki ’s [5]. Let Gd denote the isotropy group of an element in this orbit, and
Gdred the reductive part thereof. Following the notation of [5], we have

                               Gdred ≃ GL(a1 )k∆1 × · · · × GL(al )k∆l .
Here, H∆ m denotes the diagonal copy of H in the product of m copies of itself. Now, in

the case of simply connected semisimple groups, we identify local systems on an orbit with
representations of the component group of the centralizer of an element in the orbit. In the
setting of GL(n), we will first produce a list of representations of Gdred , and then we will
examine their restrictions to SL(n) to determine the correspondence with local systems.
   Let A1 ∈ GL(a1 ), A2 ∈ GL(a2 ), etc. The set of matrices (A1 , . . . , Al ) determines an
element Ã of
                                   GL(a1 )k∆1 × · · · × GL(al )k∆l ;
          LOCAL SYSTEMS ON NILPOTENT ORBITS AND WEIGHTED DYNKIN DIAGRAMS                            3

moreover, we have
                                 det Ã = (det A1 )k1 · · · (det Al )kl .
Since every ki is divisible by c, we can write this as
                                                                         c
                             det Ã = (det A1 )k1 /c · · · (det Al )kl /c .

Let “det1/c ” denote the character Gdred → C× given by

                                    (det A1 )k1 /c · · · (det Al )kl /c ,
and for any p ∈ Z, let detp/c denote the p-th power of this map.
  In SL(n), the isotropy group SL(n)d is the subgroup of Gd consisting of matrices of
determinant 1. The function det1/c takes only finitely many values when restricted to this
subgroup, namely, the c-th roots of unity. Indeed, the component group of SL(n)d is just
Z/cZ, and the irreducible representations of Z/cZ are just powers of the function det1/c .
We have, then, that the irreducible representations of π1 (Od ) come from
                                   det0/c , det1/c , . . . , det(c−1)/c .
   Now we need to compute γ(Od , detp/c ) for 0 ≤ p ≤ c − 1. Suppose that the dual partition
of d is dt = [j1b1 , . . . , jsbs ]. Following the notation of [1], we let Ld denote the Levi subgroup
                                Ld = GL(j1 )b1 × · · · × GL(js )bs ,
and we let Pd be the standard (block-upper-triangular) parabolic subgroup whose Levi
factor is Ld . Recall that every nilpotent orbit in GL(n) is Richardson; in particular, Od
is Richardson for Pd . We fix a choice of e ∈ Od such that Gdred ⊂ Ld and Gd ⊂ Pd .
Explicitly, the embedding of Gd in Pd is such that the factor GL(ai )k∆i sits diagonally across
the product of the first ki factors of Ld . Let ρd denote the half-sum of the positive roots of
Ld .
   We make the observation that any irreducible representation of Gd must be trivial on its
unipotent radical, hence is completely determined by its restriction to Gdred . Therefore, it
makes sense to refer to irreducible representations of Gd by their highest weights. We do
this at various points below.
   In [1], the computational device of “weight diagrams” was introduced and employed to
carry out the computation of γ. For our present purposes, however, we are only concerned
with a small collection of representations for each orbit, and we do not need to use the
cumbersome weight diagrams. Instead, we make use of the following auxiliary result.
Proposition 2.1 ([1], Claim 2.3.1). Let (πλ , Vλ ) denote the irreducible Ld -representation
of highest weight λ, regarded as a Pd -representation by letting the unipotent part of Pd act
trivially, and let (τ, Wτ ) be an irreducible representation of Gd . Suppose that τ occurs as a
summand in the restriction of πλ to Gd , and, moreover, that
                                              kλ + 2ρd k2
is minimal among all irreducible Pd -representations whose restriction to Gd contains τ as
a summand. Then γ(Od , τ ) = λ + 2ρd , made dominant for GL(n).

   The next proposition describes γ(Od , detp/c ) explicitly in terms of the standard basis.
The remainder of the section will be devoted to establishing this proposition. In Section 4,
we shall use this explicit description to prove the main result.
   Let ωp = γ(Od , detp/c ). Writing ω0 in the standard basis, let “block Ba ” refer to the
collection of coordinate positions which contain the entry a in ω0 , for a ∈ Z. Let µk be the
multiplicity of k in dt . (Thus, if there is some ji such that ji = k, then µk = bi ; otherwise,
µk = 0.) Note that every bi and every µk must be a multiple of c.
                                                 P
Proposition 2.2. The length of block Ba is k≥0 µa+2k+1 when a ≥ 0 and the length of
Ba and B−a are the same. Moreover, if we write the length of block Ba as ma c, then ωp is
obtained by replacing the first ma p entries in block Ba with a + 1.

Example 2.3. Consider the orbit labeled by d = [6, 3, 3] in GL(12). Then c = 3, dt =
[3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], and µ3 = 3 and µ1 = 3.
   We illustrate the preceding proposition by listing here all the ωp . The first sentence of
the proposition describes ω0 by giving the lengths of blocks, and the second sentence tells
us how to obtain the other ωp ’s by modifying ω0 .
                                     B2          B0              B−2
                                  z }| { z        }|      { z }| {
                            ω0 = (2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −2, −2, −2)
                            ω1 = (3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, −1, −2, −2)
                            ω2 = (3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, −1, −1, −2)
Proof. Let λp be the appropriate dominant weight of Ld as described in Proposition 2.1,
such that ωp is just λp + 2ρd , made dominant for GL(n). In what follows, we shall be
careless about saying “made dominant” every time; the reader should fill in those words
wherever appropriate.
  Let us begin with the trivial representation of π1 (Od ), namely det0/c . Whatever λ0 is, it
must be dominant for Ld , so that hλ0 , 2ρd i ≥ 0. Therefore
                   kλ0 + 2ρd k2 = kλ0 k2 + k2ρd k2 + 2hλ0 , 2ρd di ≥ k2ρd k2 .
Now 0 is a weight of Ld with the right restriction to Gdred , and taking λ0 = 0 obviously
minimizes kλ0 + 2ρd k2 (the above inequality becomes an equality). We therefore have
ω0 = 2ρd . What does 2ρd look like? For each GL(ji ) factor of Ld , we get a part of 2ρd
that looks like
                                  (ji − 1, ji − 3, . . . , 1 − ji ).
Thus, in the total 2ρd , a particular coordinate a with a ≥ 0 occurs once for each factor
GL(ji ) withPji = a + 2k + 1 for some k with k ≥ 0. It follows that the length of block Ba
is precisely k≥0 µa+2k+1 , as desired. It is also clear that the length of block Ba and block
B−a are equal.
   Next, we consider the case p 6= 0. We will consider the first factor GL(a1 )k∆1 of Gdred
individually; the other factors would be treated identically. The factor GL(a1 )k∆1 of Gdred
sits diagonally across various GL(ji )bi factors of Ld ; indeed, it sits across k1 of of them.
Now, given a weight λ of Ld , we obtain the coordinates of the restriction λ|Gd by summing
                                                                                 red
up coordinates of λ according to the diagonal embedding of the factors of Gdred in Ld . (See
         LOCAL SYSTEMS ON NILPOTENT ORBITS AND WEIGHTED DYNKIN DIAGRAMS                          5

[1] for a detailed account of how to restrict weights from Ld to Gdred .) In any case, we
add up k1 distinct coordinates of λ to obtain each coordinate of the GL(a1 )k∆1 part of the
restriction of λ. Now, the highest (and only) weight of Gdred on the representation detp/c is
                                                                       !
                            pk         pk1         pk         pkl 
                               1                        l
                                 ,... ,      ,... ,       ,... ,        ;
                           | c {z c }               | c {z c }
                                        k                      k
                                 GL(a1 )∆1              GL(al )∆l

in particular, every coordinate in the GL(a1 )k∆1 part of the weight is equal to pk1 /c. If
we want kλk2 to be minimal, it is clear that the k1 coordinates we add up to obtain this
coordinate should consist of pk1 /c 1’s and (c − p)k1 /c 0’s.
   Repeating this argument for every factor of Gdred , we see that kλk2 is minimized if, among
all its coordinates, there are pn/c 1’s and (c − p)n/c 0’s. But to compute γ, we need to
minimize kλ + 2ρd k2 , not kλk2 . We have
                           kλ + 2ρd k2 = kλk2 + k2ρd k2 + 2hλ, 2ρd i.
So among possible λ’s of minimal size, we could try to choose one so as to minimize hλ, 2ρd i.
In fact, we can arrange for the latter inner product to be 0.
   Among the factors GL(ji )bi of Ld , take the weight (1, . . . , 1) (i.e., the determinant char-
acter) on pbi /c of the factors, and (0, . . . , 0) on the remaining (c − p)bi /c of them. Con-
catenating these weights together, we obtain a weight λp of Ld . It is easy to see that λp
has the right number of 0’s and 1’s to have the desired restriction to Gdred as well as to be
of minimal size. Moreover, as promised, we have that hλp , 2ρd i = 0.
   Therefore, ωp = λp + 2ρd . This looks very similar to ω0 , except that in each block Ba ,
a proportion p/c of the coordinates have been increased by 1. Thus ωp has precisely the
desired form.

                       3. A conjecture about Dynkin diagrams
   Let LG, LB, LT be the data of the Langlands dual group corresponding to G, B, T ,
respectively. Let Lg, Lb, Lh denote the Lie algebras of LG, LB, LT , respectively. The weights
of T can be identified with the elements h ∈ Lh such that α∨ (h) is integral for all coroots α∨
of G (which are the roots of LG). This identification allows us to associate to a nilpotent
orbit LO in Lg a dominant weight for G. Namely, we can choose e ∈ LO and let e, h, f span
an sl2 -subalgebra of Lg with h ∈ Lh. Then by Dynkin-Kostant theory, h is well-defined up
to W -conjugacy, and by sl2 -theory, h takes integral values at the coroots of G. Hence, h
determines an element of Λ+ . We refer to the dominant weight of G thus obtained as the
Dynkin weight of LO, and we denote by D ⊂ Λ+ the set of Dynkin weights of all nilpotent
orbits in Lg.
   In the previous section, we saw that ω0 = 2ρd (made dominant for GL(n)). This is
nothing more than the Dynkin weight of the nilpotent orbit Odt (we are identifying G with
L
 G), since Odt intersects the Lie algebra of Ld in the regular orbit. This result and a similar
one for Richardson orbits in other groups (along with calculations in groups of low rank)
have led a number of people to conjecture that D is a subset of Λloc  + (see [4]). We wish to
                                                          loc
state a precise conjecture about how D sits inside of Λ+ . To this end, we assign to each

Lusztig-Spaltenstein duality. Our conjecture essentially says that if we write our putative
finite cover of O as G/K, then for some τ which is trivial on K, γ(O, τ ) equals the Dynkin
weight of LO.
   Let A(O) denote the fundamental group of O and let Ā(O) denote Lusztig’s canonical
quotient of A(O) (see [8], [14]). Let No,c be the set of pairs (O, C) consisting of a nilpotent
orbit O ∈ g and a conjugacy class C ⊂ A(O). We denote by LNo the set of nilpotent orbits
in Lg. In [14] a duality map d : No,c → LNo is defined which extends Lusztig-Spaltenstein
duality. This map is surjective and the image of an element (O, C) ∈ No,c , denoted d(O,C) ,
depends only on the image of the conjugacy class C in Ā(O).
   Now given LO ∈ Lg, Proposition 13 of [14] exhibits an explicit element (O, C) ∈ No,c
such that d(O,C) = LO. The orbit O also satisfies O = d(LO) (in particular, O is special).
Consider the image of C in Ā(O), which we will also denote by C. We suspect that this
conjugacy class coincides with one that Lusztig associates to LO using the special piece for
L
 O (see Remark 14 in [14]).
   The canonical quotient Ā(O) of A(O) is always of the form S3 , S4 , S5 or a product of
copies of S2 . Hence, it is possible to describe Ā(O) as a Coxeter group of type A and then
to associate to each conjugacy class C in Ā(O) a subgroup HC of Ā(O) which is well-defined
up to conjugacy in Ā(O). Lusztig did this for the exceptional groups in [10] and we now do
it for the classical groups.
   First we need to describe Ā(O) as a Coxeter group in the classical groups (where Ā(O) is a
product of copies of S2 ). We use the description of Ā(O) in [14]. Let λ = [λa11 , λa22 , . . . , λakk ]
be the partition corresponding to O in the appropriate classical group of type B, C, or D.
Let M be the set of integers m equal to some λi such that
                                 λi is odd and νi is odd in type Bn
(2)                             λi is even and νi is even in type Cn
                                λi is odd and νi is even in type Dn
             P
where νi = ij=1 aj . Then from section 5 of [14], we know that the elements of Ā(O) are
indexed by subsets of M in type C and by subsets of M of even cardinality in types B and
D. In type C we choose our set of simple reflections in Ā(O) to correspond to subsets of M
with a single element. In type B and D we choose our set of simple reflections in Ā(O) to
correspond to subsets {a, b} of M with a > b and where no element of M is both less than
a and greater than b. Thus given a conjugacy class C of Ā(O) (which consists of a single
element, w, since the group is abelian), we can write w minimally as a product of simple
reflections. The simple reflections used are unique, and we define HC to be the subgroup of
Ā(O) generated by those simple reflections. Consider the surjection π : Ge → Ā(O) where
e ∈ O and define K = π −1 (HC ) in Ge . We can now make our conjecture.
   Given LO in Lg, we have assigned a conjugacy class C in Ā(O) where O = d(LO) and
then a subgroup K in Ge where e ∈ O. Consider the finite cover Õ = G/K of O. Let
                                                                                   P
C[Õ] denote the global algebraic functions on Õ. It is immediate that C[Õ] =       Γ(O, L)
where the sum is over the irreducible local systems L (counted with multiplicity) which
arise from the irreducible representations of A(O) appearing in IndK                    e 0
                                                                      (Ge )0 C, where (G ) is
   identity component of Ge . Hence (1) implies that as a G-module C[Õ] can be written
theP
as λ∈Λ+ mλ IndG T λ. Let µ be a weight of largest length with mµ 6= 0.

Conjecture 3.1. The weight µ is unique and is the Dynkin weight of LO.
   We have verified the conjecture in a number of cases, although a general proof is elusive
at the moment.
   It seems likely that when τ gives rise to a local system, denoted Lτ , that M (e, τ ) is
just the direct image of Lτ from Oe to the whole nilpotent cone and so Γ(N , M (e, τ )) =
P e , Lτ ) (this would be consistent with Bezrukavnikov’s and Ostrik’s work).
Γ(O                                                                           Since C[Õ] =
   Γ(O, L), Conjecture 3.1 would then state that the Dynkin weight of O occurs as γ(O, τ )
                                                                       L

for some irreducible representation τ of Ge which is trivial on K.
Remark 3.2. Specifying exactly what τ is seems to be more difficult. For example, let LO
be the subregular orbit in type Bn . Then O = d(LO) is the smallest non-zero special orbit
in type Cn . This orbit is Richardson, coming from the parabolic subgroup with Levi factor
of type Cn−1 , and the parabolic subgroup gives rise to a 2-fold cover of O. Thus it is clear
that the Dynkin weight of LO comes from this 2-fold cover of O (which is, in fact, the one
specified by our conjecture) since LO is regular in a Levi factor of type Bn−1 . However,
when n is odd, the Dynkin weight will correspond to the trivial local system on O, but
when n is even, the Dynkin weight will correspond to the non-trivial local system on O (see
the calculations in [4]).

                    4. Cohomology of the associated sub-bundles
   For an element h ∈ h, we can define a subspace nh of the nilradical n of b as follows. We
set
                                             M
                                  nh =               gα
                                           α a positive root
                                               α(h)≥2

where gα is the α-eigenspace of the root α. As in the previous section, we may identify
Λ+ (LG) with a subset of h. Then for λ ∈ Λ+ (LG) we get a subspace nλ of n. Our definition
is motivated by the fact that if λ ∈ h happens to be a Dynkin weight for a nilpotent orbit
O ∈ g, then by work of McGovern, C[G ×B nλ ] ≃ C[O] [11] and moreover, by work of
Hinich and Panyushev, H i (G/B, S j (n∗λ )) = 0 for all j ≥ 0 and i > 0 [7], [13]. Hence, it
seems reasonable, especially given Conjecture 3.1, to pick a general element λ ∈ Λloc+ ( G)
                                                                                        L
                                          P
and study H i (G/B, S j (n∗λ )). Note that j≥0 H 0 (G/B, S j (n∗λ )) ≃ C[G ×B nλ ].
   We begin with the definition
Definition 4.1. Two B-representations V, Ṽ are called G/B-equivalent if
                          H i (G/B, S j (V ∗ )) ≃ H i (G/B, S j (Ṽ ∗ )).
for all i, j ≥ 0.
  Our main result is for GL(n), and we identify G with LG. We hope in future work to say
something interesting for other groups.
Theorem 4.2. Fix the partition d and let nd,p = nωp . For any p the B-representations
nd,p are all mutually G/B-equivalent to each other. Thus, we have for any p that
                         H i (G/B, S j (n∗d,p )) ≃ H i (G/B, S j (n∗d,0 ))
8                           PRAMOD N. ACHAR AND ERIC N. SOMMERS

and the latter equals 0 if i > 0 and equals Cj [Odt ] if i = 0 (the algebraic functions on the
dual orbit of degree 2j).
  The last sentence is just a re-formulation of the Hinich, McGovern, and Panyushev results.
Before proving the theorem, we prove two lemmas which rely on the following proposition.
Proposition 4.3. Let Ṽ ⊂ V be representations of B such that V /Ṽ ≃ Cµ is a one-
dimensional representation of B corresponding to the character µ. Let α be a simple root,
and let Pα be the parabolic subgroup containing B and having α as the only positive root
in its reductive part. If V extends to a Pα -representation and hα∨ , µi = −1, then V, Ṽ are
G/B-equivalent.
Proof. Consider the exact sequence 0 → Ṽ → V → Cµ → 0 and its dual 0 → C−µ → V ∗ →
Ṽ ∗ → 0. By Koszul, we have 0 → S j−1 (V ∗ ) ⊗ C−µ → S j (V ∗ ) → S j (Ṽ ∗ ) → 0 is exact for
all j ≥ 0. By the lemma of Demazure [6], H ∗ (G/B, S j−1 (V ∗ ) ⊗ C−µ ) = 0 for all j ≥ 1 since
V ∗ is Pα -stable and hα∨ , −µi = 1 (here our B corresponds to the positive roots, hence the
difference with Demazure’s convention). The result follows from the long exact sequence in
cohomology.
   We need to introduce notation to describe the B-stable subspaces of n. It is clear that
if gα belongs to a B-stable subspace U of n, then so does gβ for all positive roots β with
α  β (where  denotes the usual partial order on positive roots). Hence it is enough to
describe U by the positive roots α such that gα ⊂ U and α is minimal among all positive
roots with this property. In this case, we say that α is minimal for U .
   List the simple roots of G as α1 , . . . , αn−1 . Then any positive root of G = GL(n) is of
the form αi + αi+1 + · · · + αj , which we denote by [i, j]. We can express the usual partial
order on the positive roots as [i, j]  [i′ , j ′ ] if and only if i′ ≤ i and j ≤ j ′ . We can then
specify U by its minimal positive roots, namely a collection of intervals [i, j] such that for
any two intervals [i, j] and [i′ , j ′ ] with i ≤ i′ , we have j ≥ j ′ . We will say that U is partially
specified by the interval [i, j] if the root [i, j] is minimal for U (although there may be other
minimal roots). Let us also say that U is i-stable if U is stable under the action of the
parabolic subgroup Pαi .
   Let U be a B-stable subspace of n which is partially specified by the interval [a, b] and
which is either (a−1)-stable or (b+1)-stable. Let U ′ be the subspace of n which is specified
by the same intervals as U except that [a, b] is replaced by the two intervals [a − 1, b] and
[a, b + 1]. Then U and U ′ are G/B-equivalent. This is simply an application of Proposition
4.3 where µ is the root [a, b] and α is either αa−1 or αb+1 . We refer to the G/B-equivalence
of U and U ′ as the basic move for a − 1 (respectively, for b + 1). We now state two lemmas
which rely solely on the basic move.
Lemma 4.4. Let U be a subspace of n which is partially specified by an interval [a, b] and
such that U is i-stable for b < i < d for some d. Let U ′ be the subspace of n specified by the
same intervals as those defining U , but replacing [a, b] with the collection of intervals
                                {[a − j + 1, d − j] | 1 ≤ j ≤ d − b}.
Then U is G/B-equivalent to U ′ .
Proof. Applying the basic move for b + 1 replaces [a, b] with the intervals [a − 1, b] ∪ [a, b + 1].
Now apply the basic move repeatedly on the right (for i in the range b + 2 ≤ i < d) to the
           LOCAL SYSTEMS ON NILPOTENT ORBITS AND WEIGHTED DYNKIN DIAGRAMS                                     9

interval [a, b + 1] and we are left with the two intervals [a − 1, b] ∪ [a, d − 1]. The general
result follows by induction on d − b: we apply the proposition to the interval [a − 1, b] with
d replaced by d − 1. The base case d − b = 1 is trivially true.

Lemma 4.5. Let U be a subspace of n partially specified by the intervals
                       [b0 , b1 ] ∪ [b1 + 1, b2 ] ∪ · · · ∪ [bl−1 + 1, bl ] ∪ [bl + 1, bl+1 ]
and
                                     [b1 , b2 − 1] ∪ · · · ∪ [bl−1 , bl − 1]
where bj ≤ bj+1 − 2 for 1 ≤ j ≤ l − 1. Assume that no interval of U is of the form [bl , a1 ] but
that there are intervals of U of the form [b0 − 1, a2 ] and [a3 , bl+1 + 1]. Let U ′ be the subspace
of n specified by the same intervals as U , except that [b0 , b1 ] is replaced by [b0 , b1 − 1] and
[bl + 1, bl+1 ] is replaced by [bl , bl+1 ]. Then U is G/B-equivalent to U ′ . A similar statement
holds even if the we omit the interval [bl + 1, bl+1 ] or [b0 , b1 ] from the specification of U .
Proof. Let U1 be specified by the same intervals as U , except with the above intervals
replaced by the intervals
        [b0 , b1 ] ∪ [b1 + 1, b2 − 1] ∪ [b2 + 1, b3 − 1] ∪ · · · ∪ [bl−1 + 1, bl − 1] ∪ [bl + 1, bl+1 ]
Then U1 is seen to be G/B-equivalent to U by applying the the basic move to the roots
[b1 + 1, b2 − 1], [b2 + 1, b3 − 1], . . . , [bl−1 + 1, bl − 1] since U1 is stable for b2 , b3 , . . . , bl . The
stability for bl follows from the assumption that no interval of U is of the form [bl , a1 ].
   Let U2 be specified by the same intervals as U1 , except we replace the interval [b0 , b1 ]
with [b0 , b1 − 1] and the interval [bl + 1, bl+1 ] with [bl , bl+1 ]. Then U2 is G/B-equivalent to
U1 . This can be seen by applying the basic move to [b0 , b1 − 1] (as U2 is stable for b1 ) and
applying the basic move (in reverse) to [bl , bl+1 ] (as U1 is bl -stable). Here we are using the
fact that U contains intervals of the form [b0 − 1, a2 ] and [a3 , bl+1 + 1].
   The proof is completed by observing that U2 is stable for b1 , b2 , . . . , bl−1 , so we can apply
the basic move to the roots [b1 + 1, b2 − 1], [b2 + 1, b3 − 1], . . . , [bl−1 + 1, bl − 1], arriving at
U ′.
Proof of Theorem 4.2. For an orbit corresponding to d and a local system corresponding
to p, we have computed ωp in Section 2.P   We recall that c is the g.c.d. of the parts of d and
ma was defined by the equation ma c = i≥0 µa+2i+1 , where µi is the multiplicity of i as a
                                                                             P
part in dt . Write k for one less than the largest part of dt , and set si = j≥i mj c.
   Then by Proposition 2.2, nd,p = nωp is specified by the set of intervals
                                       Ii = [si+1 + pmi , si + pmi−1 ]
where k ≥ i ≥ −k + 1. The difference between the left endpoint of Ii and the right endpoint
of Ii+2 will be denoted ∆i . So
                                         ∆i = (c − p)mi+1 + pmi .
For i ≥ 1 we have ∆i ≤ ∆−i ≤ ∆i−2 since m−i = mi and mi ≤ mi−2 when i ≥ 1.
  Step 1. Application of Lemma 4.4 to each of the intervals Ii shows that nd,p is G/B-
equivalent to the subspace W of n defined by the set of intervals
                             Ii,j = [si+1 + pmi − j + 1, si−1 + pmi−2 − j]
10                         PRAMOD N. ACHAR AND ERIC N. SOMMERS

where 1 ≤ j ≤ ∆i if k ≥ i ≥ 1 and where 1 ≤ j ≤ ∆i−2 if 0 ≥ i ≥ −k + 1. In the former
case, if ∆i < j ≤ ∆i−2 , then the intervals Ii,j are not minimal, so we may omit them from
our specification of W .
   Step 2. Now for each r in the range k ≥ r ≥ 1, starting with r = k and working down
to r = 1, we will modify the intervals Ir+1,j and I−r+1,j for j > pmr+1 (in the cases where
those intervals are defined) to obtain a new subspace of n which is G/B-equivalent to W .
   First, we will modify I−r+1,j for ∆r+1 < j ≤ ∆−r−1 . Consider the intervals
                            Ir−1,j ∪ Ir−3,j ∪ · · · ∪ I−r+5,j ∪ I−r+3,j
for ∆−r−1 < j ≤ ∆r−1 and the intervals
                            Ir−1,j ∪ Ir−3,j ∪ · · · ∪ I−r+3,j ∪ I−r+1,j
for ∆r+1 < j ≤ ∆−r−1 . These yield a situation where we can apply Lemma 4.5 a total
number of ∆r−1 − ∆−r−1 = p(mr−1 − m−r−1 ) times to each of the intervals I−r+1,j for
∆r+1 < j ≤ ∆−r−1 . This will replace I−r+1,j = [s−r+2 + pm−r+1 − j + 1, s−r + pm−r−1 − j]
with [s−r+2 + pm−r−1 − j + 1, s−r + pm−r−1 − j].
   Second, we will modify both Ir+1,j and I−r+1,j for pmr+1 < j ≤ ∆r+1 Consider the
intervals
                          Ir−1,j ∪ Ir−3 ∪ · · · ∪ I−r+5,j ∪ I−r+3,j
for ∆r+1 < j ≤ (∆r−1 − ∆−r−1 ) + ∆r+1 and the intervals
                            Ir+1,j ∪ Ir−1,j ∪ · · · ∪ I−r+3,j ∪ I−r+1,j
for pmr+1 < j ≤ ∆r+1 . We again apply Lemma 4.5 a total number of ∆r−1 − ∆−r−1 times
by modifying the pair of intervals Ir+1,j ∪ I−r+1,j . Then for pmr+1 < j ≤ ∆r+1 we replace
Ir+1,j ∪ I−r+1,j with [sr+2 + pmr+1 − j + 1, sr + pmr+1 − j] ∪ [s−r+2 + pm−r−1 − j + 1, s−r +
pm−r−1 − j].
   We do this for all r starting with r = k and working backward to r = 1 (note we haven’t
done anything to the intervals I1,j ).
   Step 3. At this point our subspace of n is specified by the following intervals: [si − l +
1, si−2 − l] for i ≥ 2 with 1 ≤ l ≤ (c − p)mi and for 1 ≥ i with 1 ≤ l ≤ (c − p)mi−2 , and
those Ii,j where j ≤ pmi for i ≥ 1 and j ≤ pmi+2 for i ≤ 0.
   Fix r ≥ 1. We may assume by induction on r that our subspace is G/B-equivalent to one
partially specified by the following intervals (the case r = 1 is already true): [si −l+1, si−2 −l]
for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and 1 ≤ l ≤ cmi ; and [si − l + 1, si−2 − l] for 0 ≥ i ≥ −r + 2 and 1 ≤ l ≤ cmi−2 .
We want to show that the our subspace is G/B-equivalent to one partially specified by the
previous intervals together with the cases where i = r + 1 and i = −r + 1 in the above
formulas.
   Let Ji,l = [si+1 − l + 1, si−1 − l]. Consider the intervals
                 Ir+1,j ∪ Jr−2,j+(c−p)mr−1 ∪ · · · ∪ J−r+2,j+(c−p)mr−1 ∪ I−r+1,j
for 1 ≤ j ≤ pmr+1 and the intervals
                                      Jr−2,l ∪ · · · ∪ J−r+2,l
for 1 ≤ l ≤ (c−p)mr−1 . We apply Lemma 4.5 a total number of (c−p)(mr−1 −mr+1 ) times to
the pair of intervals Ir+1,j ∪ I−r+1,j for 1 ≤ j ≤ pmr+1 . We thus replace Ir+1,j ∪ I−r+1,j with
[sr+2 +pmr+1 −j +1, sr−1 +(p−c)mr+1 −j]∪[s−r+1 +(p−c)m−r−1 −j +1, s−r +pm−r−1 −j].
          LOCAL SYSTEMS ON NILPOTENT ORBITS AND WEIGHTED DYNKIN DIAGRAMS                                   11

These intervals are just [sr+1 − l + 1, sr−1 − l] ∪ [s−r+1 − l + 1, s−r−1 − l] for (c − p)mr+1 <
l ≤ cmr+1 . Hence, by induction on r we see that our original subspace is G/B-equivalent
to the subspace specified by the intervals Ji,l where 1 ≤ l ≤ cmi+1 for i ≥ 1 and where
1 ≤ l ≤ cmi−1 for i ≤ 0. This subspace is independent of p which completes the proof.
