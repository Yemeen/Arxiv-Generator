                                                  Let A be an associative simple (central) superalgebra over C and L an invariant
                                                  linear functional on it (trace). Let a 7→ at be an antiautomorphism of A such that
                                                  (at )t = (−1)p(a) a, where p(a) is the parity of a, and let L(at ) = L(a). Then A admits
                                                  a nondegenerate supersymmetric invariant bilinear form ha, bi = L(abt ). For A =
                                                  U (sl(2))/m, where m is any maximal ideal of U (sl(2)), Leites and I have constructed
                                                  orthogonal basis in A whose elements turned out to be, essentially, Chebyshev (Hahn)
                                                  polynomials in one discrete variable. Here I take A = U (osp(1|2))/m for any maximal
                                                  ideal m and apply a similar procedure. As a result we obtain either Hahn polynomials
                                                  over C[τ ], where τ 2 ∈ C, or a particular case of Meixner polynomials, or — when
                                                  A = Mat(n + 1|n) — dual Hahn polynomials of even degree, or their (hopefully, new)
                                                  analogs of odd degree. Observe that the nondegenerate bilinear forms we consider for
                                                  orthogonality are, as a rule, not sign definite.


                                            1     Introduction
                                            Classically, orthogonal polynomials were considered with respect to a sign definite bilinear
                                            form. Lately we encounter the growth of interest to the study of orthogonal polynomials
                                            relative an arbitrary (but still symmetric and nondegenerate) form, cf. [4, 7, 8] and referen-
                                            ces therein. In these approaches, however, the bilinear forms are introduced “by hands”
                                            and the differential or difference equations the orthogonal polynomials satisfy are of high
                                            degree. We would like to point out that traces and supertraces on associative algebras
                                            and superalgebras are natural sources of bilinear symmetric forms which are seldom sign-
                                            definite. The Lie structure on the algebras obtained from these associative algebras and
                                            superalgebras is more adapted to the study of orthogonal polynomials. In particular, the
                                            eigenvalue problem for the Casimir operator — the quadratic element of the center with
                                            respect to the Lie structure — naturally provides with a 2nd degree difference equation
                                            for the polynomials orthogonal relative the above (super)traces.

   Let sl(2) be represented as Span(Y, H, X) subject to relations

      [X, Y ] = H,         [H, Y ] = −2Y,       [H, X] = 2X.                                (1.1)

                2
lies in the center of U (sl(2)). Let Iλ be the two-sided ideal in the associative algebra
U (sl(2)) generated by Ω − 12 (λ2 − 1). It turns out that the associative algebra Ãλ =
U (sl(2))/Iλ is simple for λ 6∈ Z \{0}, otherwise Ãλ contains an ideal such that the quotient
is isomorphic to the matrix algebra Mat(|λ|). Set ([1])
            (
                Ãλ ,          if λ 6∈ Z \ {0},

                Mat(|λ|),      otherwise.

Clearly, A−λ ≃ Aλ . As associative algebra, Aλ is generated by X, Y , and H subject to
relations

and one more relation for integer values of λ:

      X |λ| = 0    if λ ∈ Z \ {0}.                                                          (1.5)

It is also known that Aλ possesses an antiautomorphism u 7→ ut given on generators by
the formula

      X t = Y,          Y t = X,     H t = H.                                               (1.6)

In [6] we have shown that on Aλ there exists a unique, up to a constant factor, nontrivial
linear functional L, which for positive integer λ’s is the usual trace and which satisfies
L ut = L(u). By means of this functional        we define an invariant symmetric bilinear form
h·, ·i on Aλ , by setting hu, vi = L uv t . The form h·, ·i is nondegerate and symmetric.

     Now, consider Aλ as an sl(2)-module with respect to the adjoint representation. We

Clearly, H arranges a Z-grading on Aλ , namely

      [G, G] = 2X,          [F, F ] = −2Y.
For convenience we add also the following corollaries
      [H, X] = 2X,           [H, Y ] = −2Y,

      [X, Y ] = H,         [G, Y ] = F,       [F, X] = G.
These relations immediately imply that U (osp(1|2)) is generated, as associative superal-
gebra, by F , H, and G. Set

  i) The element τ belongs to the supercenter of U (osp(1|2)), i.e., it commutes with the
     even elements and anticommutes with the odd ones.
  ii) The centralizer of the Cartan subalgebra of osp(1|2) in U (osp(1|2)) is generated by H
      and τ .

 iii) Ω = τ 2 −   4   is the quadratic Casimir element of U (osp(1|2)).

   A theorem of Pinczon. Pinczon [12] described the maximal two-sided ideals of
U (osp(1|2)). Let us formulate his results in a form convenient to us.
Enveloping Superalgebra U (osp(1|2)) and Orthogonal Polynomials                            233

Theorem 2.1.
  A) Every maximal two-sided ideal of U (osp(1|2)) is of the form mλ , where mλ is:
                                2
     generated by τ 2 − λ + 21 for λ 6∈ Z≥0 ∪ − 21 ;
                                                  	

     the kernel of the finite dimensional representation with highest weight λ for λ ∈ Z≥0 ;
     generated by τ for λ = − 12 .
  B) Let Bλ = U (osp(1|2))/mλ . Then

         i) If λ 6∈ Z≥0 ∪{− 12 }, then Bλ is generated by G, H, and F subject to the relations

                  [H, G] = G,  [H, F ] = −F ; [G, F ] = H;
                         1

                                        2
                  τ = H + − 2F G,      τ = λ+      .
                         2                     2

        ii) The superalgebra B− 1 is isomorphic to the Weil algebra A1 = Diff (1) = C[P, Q]
                                  2
            considered as superalgebra when generators are considered to be odd (recall that
            the defining relations in Diff (1) are P Q − QP = 1.
        iii) Bλ ≃ Mat(λ + 1|λ) for λ ∈ Z≥0 .

   On the structure of Bλ. Recall that an antiautomorphism of superalgebra A is
an even linear map a 7→ at for a ∈ A such that (ab)t = (−1)p(a)p(b) bt at . Define an
antiautomorphism of U (osp(1|2)) by setting H t = H, F t = G, Gt = −F . Clearly, this
antiautomorphism induces an antiautomorphism of Bλ for every λ.
   Later on, I will show that on Bλ exists a unique, up to a scalar factor,     nontrivial
                                                                             t
invariant linear functional — the supertrace str. So the form hu, vi = str uv determines
an invariant supersymmetric bilinear form on Bλ . The lack of nonzero two-sided ideals
guarantees the non-degeneracy
                   1	          of the form.
   For λ 6∈ Z+ ∪ − 2 the algebra Bλ possesses a Z-grading of the form Bλ = ⊕ (Bλ )i ,
                                                                                    i∈Z
where

      (Bλ )i = {u ∈ Bλ | [H, u] = iu for i ∈ Z}.

For f, g ∈ C[H, τ ] and i ≥ 0 set

      hf, gii = hf Gi , gGi i   and     hf, gi−i = hf F i , gF i i.                       (2.6)
                         2
Recall that τ 2 = λ + 12 and introduce a Z-grading in C[H, τ ] by setting deg H = 2,
deg τ = 1. Now it is not difficult to verify that for any i ∈ Z there exists a basis {fk }k≥0
such that deg fk = k and hfk , f i = 0 if deg f < k. In what follows the basis elements with
such properties will be called orthogonal polynomials in H and τ .
   Set also

      ∆(H) = ∇(H) = 1,          ∆(τ ) = −2τ,        ∇(τ ) = 2τ                            (2.7)

and extend the action of the operators ∆ and ∇ onto C[H, τ ] by setting

      ∆(f g) = ∆(f ) · g + f · ∆(g) + ∆(f )∆(g),
                                                                                          (2.8)
      ∇(f g) = ∇(f ) · g + f · ∇(g) + ∇(f )∇(g).

Besides, set
      ∆2 (τ ) = ∇2 (τ ) = 0
and extent the action of the operators ∆2 and ∇2 onto C[H, τ ] by formulas similar to (2.8).

   The case of Bλ for λ ∈ Z≥0 In this case Bλ = Mat(λ + 1|λ) and the image of τ
under the natural homomorphism U (osp(1|2)) −→ Bλ is a polynomial in H. Therefore,
having applied the arguments after Theorem 2.1 (on the structure of Bλ ) we obtain an
orthogonal basis distinct from the basis of orthogonal polynomials.

U (sl(2)) considered as a superalgebra such that p(U ) = p(V ) = 1, p(H) = 0. Observe also
that the images of U , V , and H in Bλ generate Bλ and are subject to relations

Z-graded Bλ = ⊕ (Bλ )i , where

Being a matrix superalgebra, Bλ possesses an antiautomorphism, the supertransposition,
which in terms of the generators is given by the formula
      H t = H,             U t = −V,         V t = U.
The supertrace gives rise to a bilinear form hu, vi = str uv t on Bλ .

   Namely, let a = x1 · · · xn ; let us perform induction on n to prove that [a, A] ⊂ [X, A].
For n = 1 the statement is obvious. If n > 1, then a = xa1 , where x ∈ X and due to (3.1)
we have

      [a, c] = [xa1 , c] = [x, a1 c] + ε(x, a1 c)[a1 , cx].

Lemma 3.2. Let A be an associative superalgebra and a 7→ at be its antiautomorphism
(supertransposition, i.e., it satisfies (ab)t = (−1)p(a)p(b) bt at and (at )t = (−1)p(a) a). Let
L be an even invariant functional on A (like supertrace, i.e., L([A, A]) = 0) such that
L(at ) = L(a) for any a ∈ A. Define the bilinear form on A by setting

Then hu, vi = hv, ui and

Since L is even, we see that hu, vi =6 0 only if p(v) = p(u). But in this case (−1)p(v)(p(u)+1)

      (Bλ )i = {f Gi | f ∈ C[H, τ ]},       (Bλ )−i = {f F i | f ∈ C[H, τ ]}.

Therefore, L((Bλ )i ) = 0 if i 6= 0, so any trace L is only nonzero on (Bλ )0 = C[H, τ ]. To

Lemma 3.5. Let L be a linear functional on Bλ determined in Lemma 3.4 and normed

Proof. i) Induction on n, where u = x1 . . . xn and xi ∈ Span (H, G, F ) for each i.
   For n = 1 the statement is obvious. Let u = u1 u2 and let for u1 and for u2 the
statement be true. Then

           = ut1 ut2 = (−1)p(u1 )+p(u2 ) u1 u2 = (−1)p(u) u.

   ii) Let us represent u ∈ Bλ in the form u = u0 + L(u), where u0 ∈ Ker L. But we know
that Ker L = [Bλ , Bλ ]. So

      (Ker L)t = ([Bλ , Bλ ])t = [Bλ , Bλ ] = Ker L.

Hence, ut0 ∈ Ker L and ut = ut0 + L(u). Thus, L ut = L(u).

   Proof of heading 1 of Theorem 2.2. Let u ∈ (Bλ )i , u ∈ (Bλ )j . Then

      ihu, vi = h[H, u], vi = hu, [H, v]i = jhu, vi.

Therefore, if i 6= j, then hu, vi = 0.
  Proof of heading 2 of Theorem 2.2. By [12] (see also [3]), there is an expansion
Bλ = ⊕ (Π)n (Ln ), where Ln is an irreducible highest weight module over osp(1|2) with
      n∈Z≥0
even highest weight vector, Π is the change of parity functor and where Bλ is considered
as osp(1|2)-module with respect to the adjoint representation. Itis easy to verify that L2n
is generated by the highest weight vector G2n , whereas Π L2n+1 is generated by G2n+1 τ .
Hence, fk,2i G2i ∈ L2i+k .
    Making use of Lemma 3.5, it is not difficult to verify that

      hΩ ∗ u, vi = hu, Ω ∗ vi,

where Ω is defined in Lemma 2.1 and ∗ denotes the adjoint action. This immediately
implies that hLp , Lq i = 0 if p 6= q and, therefore, hfk,2i , fl,2i i2i = 0 if k 6= l.
   Let us show now that deg fk,2i = k. (Recall again that deg H = 2, deg τ = 1.) It is
easy to verify that

Lemma 4.1. On Weyl algebra A1 = C[P, Q], there exists a unique up to a constant factor
invariant linear functional L. It is uniquely determined by its restriction onto C[H]. The
generating function of L is of the form

                    et/2
      ϕL (t) = c            for c ∈ C.
                   1 + et
Proof. Since (A1 )i = {u ∈ A1 | [H, u] = iu} for i ∈ Z, we see that L((A1 )i ) = 0 for i 6= 0.
So L is uniquely determined by its restrictions onto (A1 )0 = C[H].
   Further,

      [A1 , A1 ] ∩ C[H] = [P, (A1 )1 ] ∩ C[H] = Span([P, f Q])

where f ∈ C[H]. But

generate in U (osp(1|2)) a subalgebra isomorphic to U (sl(2)), considered as a superalgebra
with nontrivial odd part.
   It is also convenient to consider U (sl(2)) per se, not as a subalgebra of U (osp(1|2)). We
mean the following.
   Let sl(2) = Span(X, H, Y ) with relations (1.1). Consider U (sl(2)) as a superalgebra
with parity given by the formula p(X) = p(Y ) = 1 (hence, p(H) = 0). Set

           1               1                  1
      U = √ Y,        V = √ X,         H 7→     H,
            2               2                 2

we, clearly, have

The Casimir operator, being even, remains the same:

      Ω = H 2 − H + 2V U = H 2 + H + 2U V.

Therefore,

      V 2|λ| = 0 for λ ∈ Z≥0 .
                        2
   In what follows we will assume that Cλ is considered for λ ∈ C because all the proofs
hold for such λ, not only for λ ∈ Z≥0 .
   Formulas (5.3) easily imply that by setting

      H t = H,      U t = −V,      Vt =U
                                                                      t

The condition L(H) = 0 implies that c1 = c2 for λ 6= − 12 and c2 = 0 otherwise. This
proves the uniqueness.
   Let us prove the existence. By Lemma 3.1 we have

      [Cλ , Cλ ] = [U, Cλ ] + [V, Cλ ]

and
      [Cλ , Cλ ] ∩ C[H] = ([U, Cλ ] + [V, Cλ ] ∩ C[H] = [U, (Cλ )1 ] ∩ C[H]
            = Span([U, f V ] | f ∈ C[H]) = Span(f (H + 1)U v + f (H)V U | f ∈ C[H]).

Hence, deg[U, f V ] = deg f + 2. Hence, 1, H 6∈ [Cλ , Cλ ] and Cλ /[Cλ , Cλ ] is the linear span
of the images of 1 and
                      H. This proves the existence of L.
   Let L̃(u) = L ut = 0. Then L̃ is invariant and L̃(H) = L(H) = 0. The uniqueness
implies that L̃ = L.

Proof. i) Determine an automorphism of Cλ by setting

and set

       g(H) = f (H)V 2k U 2k + U 2k f (H)V 2k .

Then

In other words, g(H) is an odd polynomial. By Lemma 5.1 the generating function for L
is an even one, so L(g(H)) = 0.

Lemma 5.3. Let f, g ∈ C[H], ε = ±1, i ∈ Z≥0 . We have:
   i) If f (H)V 2i+1 = U, gV 2i+2 , then the condition εg(H) = g(2i + 2 − H) is equivalent
                                  

      to the condition f (2i + 1 − H) = −εf (H) and deg f = deg g + 1.
  ii) If f (H)V 2i = U, gV 2i+1 , then the condition εg(H) = g(2i + 1 − H) is equivalent
                                

      to the condition f (2i − H) = εf (H) and deg f = deg g + 2.

 iii) If f (H)V 2i+1 = U, gV 2i+2 , then the condition εg(H) = g(2i + 2 − H) is equivalent
                                  	

      to the condition f (2i + 1 − H) = εf (H) and deg f = deg g + 2.
  iv) If f (H)V 2i = U, gV 2i+1 , then the condition εg(H) = g(2i + 1 − H) is equivalent
                                	

      to the condition f (2i − H) = −εf (H) and deg f = deg g + 1.

Proof. i) The condition f (H)V 2i+1 = [U, gV 2i+2 ] is equivalent to the equation

      f (H) = T (H + 1)g(H + 1) − T (H − 2i − 1)g(H),                                       (5.4)

where T (H) = 12 (λ + H)(λ + 1 − H). This implies

      f (2i + 1 − H) = T (2i + 2 − H + 1)g(2i + 2 − H) − T (−H)g(2i + 1 − H)
                          = εT (H − 2i − 1)g(H) − εT (H + 1)g(H + 1) = εf (H).

Conversely, let f (2i + 1 − H) = −εf (H). Set ψ(H) = g(H) − εg(2i + 2 − H). Then (5.4)
implies

      ψ(H + 1)T (H + 1) − ψ(H)T (H − 2i − 1) = 0.                                           (5.5)

If i ≥ 0, then polynomial T (H +1) has a root α such that α−k is not a root of T (H −2i−1)
for any k ∈ Z≥0 . Select this root α. Then equation (5.5) implies ψ(α) = 0, but then
ψ(α − 1)T (α − 1 − 2i − 1) = 0 and, therefore, ψ(α − 1) = 0. So ψ(α − k) = 0 for any
k ∈ Z≥0 . Thus, ψ = 0.
    Headings ii)–iv) are similarly proved.
   Proof of heading 2 of Theorem 2.4. Let l = 2k. Let us prove by induction on k
that f2k,2i is an orthogonal polynomials of degree 2k with respect to the form h·, ·i2i . Let

      C[H]i+ = {f ∈ C[H] | f (2i − H) = f (H)}                                              (5.6)

and

      C[H]i− = {f ∈ C[H] | f (2i − H) = −f (H)}.                                            (5.7)

Then Lemma 5.2 implies that the spaces C[H]i+ and C[H]i− are orthogonal with respect to
the form h·, ·i2i . So it suffices to prove that hf2k,2i , gi2i = 0 for g ∈ C[H]i+ and deg g < 2k.

                   =         ·            1     ∆f +                                        ∆f.

In other words,
                                                                 
              (H − λ)(H + λ + 1) (H − 2i − λ + 1)(H − 2i + λ + 1)
      Df =                      +                                   ∆f.
                 2H − 2i + 1               2H − 2i + 1

By calculating the leading coefficient of Df leads us to the equation of heading 3.
  Equation of heading 4 is similarly obtained by considering operator
                 (                              )
            2i             1              2i
                                              	
     Df · V = U,                   V, f V        .
                      H − i + 12

   Proof of headings 5–7 of Theorem 2.4. Statements of heading 5 follow from the
study of automorphism θ given by formulas

      θ(H) = −H,              θ(U ) = V,     θ(V ) = U

in the same way as in heading 2 of Theorem 2.4.
   To prove statements of heading 6, consider the following subspaces of C[H]:

           i+ 12
      C[H]+        = {f ∈ C[H] | f (2i + 1 − H) = f (H)},
           i+ 12
      C[H]−        = {f ∈ C[H] | f (2i + 1 − H) = −f (H)}.

By Lemma 5.2 these subspaces are completely isotropic with respect to the form h·, ·i2i+1 .
Let us show that the form hf2k,2i+1 , f2k+1,2i+1 i2i 6= 0, while the remaining scalar products
vanish. Indeed, equations (2.15)–(2.18) imply
                                 1
      f2k,2i+1 V 2i+1 =                V, f2k,2i+2 V 2i+2
                                                          
                                    1                                                             (5.9)
                             H − i+ 2
and

      f2l+1,2i+1 V, f2l,2i+2 V 2i+2 .
                                  
                                                                                                 (5.10)

Hence,

            = h U, f2k,2i+2 V 2i+2 ,                             2i+2
                                                                   
                                                  U, f 2l,2i+2 V        i
                                   H − i + 12

                         2i+2          1                        2i+2
            = f2k,2i+2 V      , V,             U, f2l,2i+2 V         ]
                                   H − i + 12

            = hf2k,2i+2 V 2i+2 , D̃f2l,2i+2 V 2i+2 i = hf2k,2i+2 , D̃f2l,2i+2 i2i+2 ,
where
                         "                                       #
                2i+2            1
                                      U, f2l,2i+2 V 2i+2
                                                         
      D̃f · V          = V,        1
                            H − i+ 2

and is well defined thanks to Lemma 5.3i).
   It is easy to show that D̃ is selfadjoint and f2k,2i+2 is its eigenfunction corresponding
to a nonzero eigenvalue αl . So

      hf2k,2i+1 , f2l+1,2i+1 i2i+1 = αl hf2k,2i+2 , f2l,2i+2 i2i+2 .

This proves statement of heading 6.
   Statements of heading 7 are proved similar to those of heading 5.
   Proof of headings 1, 8, 9 of Theorem 2.4. Proof of heading 1 is similar to that of
heading 1 of Theorem 2.2. To prove heading 8, consider the operator
                                                              i+ 1
      D̃f · V 2i+1 = U, V, f V 2i+1
                                  
                                               for f ∈ C[H]+ 2 .
                                            i+ 12                                         i+ 1
It is easy to verify that D̃f ∈ C[H]−               and, the other way round, if f ∈ C[H]− 2 , then
             i+ 1
D̃f ∈ C[H]+ 2 . Moreover, hDf, gi2i+1 = hf, Dgi2i+1 , i.e., D is selfadjoint and deg Df =
deg f + 1 if deg f > 0. Hence,

      hDf2k,2i+1 , f2l,2i+1 i = hf2k,2i+1 , Df2l,2i+1 i = 0      if l < k.

So Df2k,2i+1 = α · Df2k+1,2i+1 . Having calculated α we obtain the statement of heading 8.
   Proof of heading 9 is similar to arguments from the proof of of headings 8 and 9 of
Theorem 2.2.
