1 Introduction
Let us consider loop groups associated with compact Lie groups. Considering the
(infinite dimensional) affine analogy of the classical theories for finite dimensional
Lie groups [1]-[3], we have in our situation the following diagram of categories
and functors

                                                           Ri S

    where
    I(W ) := HomU (h̃) (U(k̃), W )[h̃],
    H(W ) := HomU (b̃) (U(k̃), W )[h̃],
    S(V ) := V [k̃], the Zuckerman functor,
    V ∼ is the maximal U(h̃)-locally finite and H̃-semisimple module in the alge-
braic dual V ∗ ,
    V ≈ the maximal U(k̃)-locally finite and k̃-semisimple module in V ∗ ,
    C(h̃, H̃) the category of finite dimensional semisimple (h̃, H̃)-modules,
    C(b̃, H̃) the category of the U(h̃)-locally finite, H̃-semisimple and U(ñ+ )-
locally finite (b̃, H̃)-modules,

1 INTRODUCTION                                                                   3


   The functor I shows that the category C(k̃, H̃) has enough injective objects;
hence, one can define the Zuckerman derived functors
                                M
                    Ri S(V ) :=    H i (k̃, H̃; Vλ∗ ⊗ V ) ⊗ Vλ .
                                 λ∈P̃

For the objects from the subcategory O one can restrict on the injective in O
resolutions, i.e.
                             Ri (S|O ) ∼
                                       = (Ri S)|O .
By using the determinant bundle see for example [6] structure

                             det(k̃/h̃) = ∧max (k̃/h̃),

we can easily prove the natural duality for relative Lie cohomology

                     H i (k̃, H̃; V ) × H max−i (k̃, H̃; W ) → C,

for a dual pair of modules V and W, and the natural duality of Zuckerman derived
functors
                      Ri S(V ) × Rmax−i S(W ⊗ εk̃/h̃) → C,
or in a weaker form, an isomorphism

                           Ri S(V ) ∼
                                    = Rmax−i S(V ∼ )≈ .

It is easy then to deduce a Borel-Weil-Bott type theorem

                          Ri S(H(L−wλ+ρ̃)) ∼ = δi,s(w) V−λ+ρ̃ ,
                P                          P
where s(w) =        dim gα + l − 1 + i ai and ρ̃ is the sum of the fundamental
weights. Finally, it is easy to deduce an affine analogue of the Kostant theorem on
decomposition for the cohomology of the nilpotent part
                                             M
                         H i (ñ+ ; Vλ ) =         Lw(λ+ρ̃)−ρ̃

3 Category C(k̃, H̃)
Assume g̃ = k̃ to be an affine Lie algebra associated to a compact complex Lie
algebra k = k R ⊗R C, where kR is the real Lie algebra of some compact connected
Lie group K. Suppose that 2-cocycle c(., .) is integral. In this case the associated
Lie algebra extension can be lifted to an extension of the corresponding Lie groups

                      1 → T → K̃ → LK ∼
                                      = C ∞ (S1 , K) → 1.

For each subgroup H ⊂ K, consider the corresponding central extension

                               1 → T → H̃ → H → 1.

In particular, if H is some Cartan subgroup of K we have an affine extension H̃
of Cartan subgroup H. In this case, the affine Cartan subgroup H̃ is also finite
dimensional.
    The pair (k̃, H̃) is called to be compatible, if there is such a homomorphism
of affine Lie groups H̃ → Aut k̃ that the corresponding homomorphism of affine
Lie algebras h̃ → End k̃ is coincided with the adjoint representation adh̃(k̃) and
that it induces the adjoint representation Adh̃(H̃) in k̃.
    For such a fixed compatible pair (k̃, H̃) we define C(k̃, H̃) as the category
the objects of which have simultaneously (k̃, h̃)-module (see [3]) and H̃-module
structures, which are compatible in the sense

                 h(Xv) = ((Ad h)X).hv, ∀h ∈ H̃, ∀v ∈ V, X ∈ k̃.

    Remark that all the categories C(h̃, H̃), C(k̃, H̃), C(k̃, K̃), . . ., raised in the in-
troduction are the particular cases of this definition. Following M. Duflo and M.
3 CATEGORY C(K̃, H̃)                                                                   7


Vergne [2] we define now the derived Zuckermann functors and then prove their
duality in the category C(k̃, H̃).
      Denote by F (K̃) = ⊕λ∈P̃ (Vλ∗ ⊗ Vλ ) the associated algebra of matrix elements
of the standard modules, where the sum runs over the set of weight lattice P . It
is also the (k̃, H̃)-module of regular functions on K̃. Denote by r and l the right
and left regular representations of K̃ ( or k̃ ) on F (K̃), respectively. Let V be a
(k̃, H̃)-module with the action θ̌ of k̃ ( or H̃) in V . Then we define a (k̃, H̃)-module
structure on F (K̃; V ) := F (K̃) ⊗ V by

             (ψ(X)f )(k) = θ̌(X)f (k) + (l(X)f )(k), ∀x ∈ k̃, ∀k ∈ K̃,

                      (ψ(h)f )(k) = θ̌(h)f (h−1 k), ∀k, h ∈ H̃.
    This action commutes with the (k̃, H̃)-module structure ψ. The right regular
representation r ( of algebra k̃, or of group K̃ ) also commutes with the (k̃, H̃)-
module structure ψ and finally

                             r(k)ψ(X)r(k −1) = Γ(k.X).

The representation Γ of the Algebra k̃ and the representation r of the group K̃ can
be continued on

                    Hom(∧∗ k̃, F (K̃; V )) ∼
                                           = F (K̃; Hom(∧∗ k̃, V )).

     It is easy to prove ( see [2], p. 468 ) that for every Y ∈ k̃, one can define I(Y )
by
          (I(Y )µ)(k) = i(k.Y )µ(k), ∀k ∈ K̃, ∀µ ∈ F (K̃, Hom(∧∗ k̃, V ))
and that Γ(Y )−r(Y ) = d◦I(Y )+I(Y )◦d. Thus Γ and r induces a (k̃, K̃)-module
structure on the Zuckermann derived functors
                                M
                     Γi (V ) :=   H i (k̃, H̃; Vλ∗ ⊗ V ) ⊗ Vλ .
                                  λ∈P̃

In the next section, by using of the general ideas of homological algebra [3],
we show that for connected K̃, Γ◦ (V ) coincides with the Zuckermann functor
S(V ) := V [k̃] from the category C(k̃, H̃) into the category C(k̃, K̃).
    Remark that in the second part of this contribution we shall prove a version of
the Peter-Weyl theorem, which asserts that

                        S(U(k̃)∗ ) ∼
                                     M
                                   =      Vλ∗ ⊗ Vλ = F (K̃).

3 CATEGORY C(K̃, H̃)                                                                  8


Thus F (K̃) can be interpreted as the algebra of regular functions on K̃, as in the
classical case, [5], [7].
    Recall that k̃/h̃ is infinite dimensional space L[z, z −1 ] ⊗ (k/h). But it is well-
defined the determinant fiber bundle structure on det(k̃/h̃) := ∧max (k̃/h̃) ( see for
example [5] ), in case where h is a Cartan subalgebra. Because the corresponding
group H is compact, det(k̃/h̃) admits also a (k̃, H̃)-module structure εk̃/h̃ with the
trivial differential.
    Suppose that h., .i is a (k̃, H̃)-invariant pairing of (k̃, H̃)-modules V, W ∈
C(k̃, H̃).

Theorem 3.1 For each (k̃, H̃)-invariant pairing of V, W ∈ C(k̃, H̃), there exists
a (k̃, K̃)-invariant pairing of type

                         hΓi (V ), Γmax −i (W ⊗ εk̃,h̃)i → C.

Proof. Let us denote by dWK the Wiener measure on K̃. Then each H̃-invariant
ith relative cocycle
                        ω1 ⊗ f1 ∈ ∧i (k̃/h̃)∗ ⊗ F (K̃; V )
can be (k̃, H̃)-invariantly paired with any relative cocycle ω2 ⊗ f2 ⊗ ζ of degree 1
from
                       ∧max−i (k̃/h̃)∗ ⊗ F (K̃; W ) ⊗ ∧max (k̃, h̃)
by the formula
                                                  Z
         hω1 ⊗ f1 , ω ⊗ f2 ⊗ ζi = hω1 ∧ ω2 , ζi         hf1 (k), f2 (k)idWK (k).
                                                   K̃


This pairing is compatible with the differential d of the complex of relative (k̃, H̃)-
valued cocycles, i.e. for H̃-invariant elements µ1 ∈ ∧i (k̃/h̃)∗ ⊗ F (K̃; V ) and
µ2 ∈ ∧max−i (k̃, h̃)∗ ⊗ F (K̃) ⊗ ∧max (k̃, h̃), we have

                          hdµ1, µ2 i + (−1)i hµ1 , dµ2 i = 0.

The last gives thus a (k̃, K̃)-invariant pairing of the Zuckermann derived functors
of type
                          hΓi (V ), Γmax−i (W ⊗ εk̃,h̃)i → C.

4 Duality of the Zuckermann derived functors
We develop in this section the formal homological algebra on the categories C(h̃, H̃),
C(k̃, H̃), C(k̃, K̃) etc.
     First of all, it is easy to see that the category C(k̃, H̃) has enough injective ob-
jects. Really, for every object W of C(k̃, H̃), the object I(W ) = HomU (h̃) (U(k̃), W )
is injective in the category C(k̃, H̃). Furthermore every injective object in C(k̃, H̃)
can be presented as a direct summand of an object of this type I(W ). More ex-
actly, we have V ֒→ I(V ). It is easy to see that if F ∈ C(k̃, K̃), then F ∈ C(k̃, H̃)
and the exact covariant additive functor F ⊗ (.) maps the injective objects into the
same ones, commuting with the Zuckermann functor S(V ) = V [k̃]. Hence, we
have the isomorphism

                           Ri S(F ⊗ V ) ∼
                                        = F ⊗ Ri S(V ).

In particular, to each resolution 0 → V → I ∗ of type

                             0 → V → I0 → I1 → . . .

we can apply the functor U(k̃) ⊗ (.) and obtain the commutativity of Ri S with
U(k̃) ⊗ (.) and also with the multiplication functor m (i.e. the U(k̃)-action ),
following the commutative diagram


                                      ∼
                                      =
     U(k̃) ⊗ Ri S(V )                                    ✲       Ri S(U(k̃) ⊗ V )

                                  Ri S(V )

More particularly, if the submodule V ⊂ V1 ⊕ V2 ∈ C(k̃, H̃) is stable under
Z(k̃) = U(k̃)k̃ and if for some element u ∈ Z(k̃), the operator u − χ(u) acts
nilpotently on V , then so it acts also on the derived functors Ri S(V ).
    Consider the finite dimensional injective H̃-invariant Koszul resolution
                                                             d
                    0 → C → HomU (h̃) (U(k̃), ∧0 (k̃/h̃)∗ )→ . . .
4 DUALITY OF THE ZUCKERMANN DERIVED FUNCTORS                                           10

                               d
                       . . . → HomU (h̃) (U(k̃), ∧max (k̃/h̃)∗ ) → 0
and apply the tensor multiplication with V on the right. We have then an injective
resolution of V
                                                                     d
                  0 → V → HomU (h̃) (U(k̃), ∧0 (k̃/h̃)∗ ⊗ V )→
                                                             V
                                                               ...

                           d
                       V
                    ...→ HomU (h̃) (U(k̃), ∧max (k̃/h̃)∗ ⊗ V ) → 0.
Applied the Zuckermann functor S(V ) = V [k̃] and taken the H̃-invariant parts,
we have the derived functors as the cohomology groups of complex

                      Ri S(V ) = Cohi (I(∧∗ (k̃/h̃)∗ ⊗ V )H̃ , dV ).

Remark that

         HomU (h̃) (U(k̃), ∧i (k̃/h̃) ⊗ V ) ∼
                                            = HomU (h̃) (∧i (k̃/h̃), U(k̃)∗ ⊗ V ).

Hence, applying the functor S, we have

                I(∧i (k̃/h̃)∗ ⊗ V ) ∼
                                    = HomU (h̃) (∧i (k̃/h̃), R(k̃) ⊗ V ),

                        Vλ ⊗ Vλ∗ is the maximal (k̃, H̃)-bimodule in U(k̃)∗ , i.e.
                L
where R(k̃) =       λ∈P̃


            I(∧i (k̃/h̃)∗ ⊗ V ) ∼
                                  M
                                =      HomU (h̃) (∧i (k̃/h̃), V ⊗ Vλ∗ ) ⊗ Vλ .
                                   λ∈P̃

Therefore, we have the equivalence of functors

               Ri S(V ) ∼
                                    M
                        = H(V ) :=      H i (k̃, H̃; Vλ ⊗ V ) ⊗ Vλ∗ ,
                                           λ∈P̃


          Rmax−i S(V ) ∼
                                          M
                       = G(V ) :=                H max−i (k̃, H̃; V ∼ ⊗ Vλ ) ⊗ Vλ∗ .
                                          λ∈P̃

Applying Theorem 1, we have now an equivalence of functors
                                            ≃
                           TV : Ri S(V ) →         Rmax−i S(V ∼ )∼ .

Hence we obtain the result

Theorem 4.1 V −→ TV is an equivalence of functors.
5 CATEGORY O                                                                      11


5 Category O
By using the trivial action of the nilpotent part ñ+ of affine Lie algebras b̃ :=
h̃ ⊕ ñ+ , one can, in place of the category C(k̃, H̃) and the functor I consider the
category C(b̃, H̃) and the functor H,

                          H(W ) := HomU (b̃) (U(k̃), W ).

Thus we can use the subcategory O in C(k̃, H̃), which has also enough injective
objects. This is a more economic way of computing the derived functors. Remark
that the most important Verma modules belong too to this subcategory. We have
deal with this situation in proving the Borel-Weil-Bott type theorem.
    For each H(W ) ∈ O, where W ∈ C(b̃, H̃), let us consider the O-injective,
H̃-invariant resolution of type

                               0 → H(W ) → I ∗ (W ),

Lie algebra
                                    ñ = ñ+ ⊕ ñ− ,
and
                I i (W ) := (HomU (h̃) (U(k̃), ∧i n∗ ⊗ W )[h̃])H̃ ∈ O.
Then we have
                      SI i (W ) ∼
                                = HomU (h̃) (∧i ñ, R(k̃) ⊗ W )H̃
                     ∼
                       M
                     =       Vλ ⊗ (HomU (h̃) (∧i ñ, Vλ∗ ⊗ W ))H̃ .
                        λ∈P̃

Hence
                  Ri S(H(W )) ∼
                                    M
                              =            Vλ ⊗ (H i (ñ; Vλ∗ ⊗ W ))H̃ .
                                    λ∈P̃

In the category O an analogue of the classical Bernstein-Gel’fand-Gel’fand’s re-
sults [1] holds :Every indecomposable injective object is a direct summand of an
object of type

                   H((U(ñ)/ñr U(ñ))∗ ⊗ Lλ ), λ ∈ P̃ , ∀r >> 0.

Therefore, remarking that if F ∈ C(k̃, H̃),

               H i (ñ, (U(ñ)/ñr U(ñ))∗ ⊗ Lλ ⊗ F ) = 0, i = 1, 2, ...
6 BOREL-WEIL-BOTT AND KOSTANT TYPE THEOREMS                                      12


we see that in the category O all the objects are acyclic, i.e. if V is an injective
object in O, then Ri S(V ) vanishes unless i = 0. In the category O, all the
objects have finite injective cohomological dimension. Then by induction on this
dimension one proves that (Ri S)|O ∼ = Ri (S|O ). This mean that computing the
Zuckermann derived functors for objects in O is independent from the bigger
category C(k̃, H̃).


6 Borel-Weil-Bott and Kostant type theorems
Recall that by P̃ we denote the weight lattice of our compact complex affine Lie
algebra, P̃+ the Weyl chamber of the dominant weights. The Weyl group W̃ acts
on P̃ and every regular weight µ can be uniquely presented in form −wλ + ρ̃,
where λ ∈ P̃+ and w ∈ W̃ . Recall that the length function is defined by l(w) :=
#{λ ∈ Π̃; wλ = −λ} ≤ l + 1. P  If ̟ ∈ W and l(̟) = l + 1, then ̟ Π̃ = −Π̃.
    By definition, we have ρ̃ = li=0 λi and
                                               l
                                               X

                                               i=0

Remark that although dimC gkδ = l, ∀k ∈ Z \ (0), where δ ∈ h∗ , δ(d) = 1 and
δ|h+Cc = 0, we have always dim L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ = 1.
    Let us introduce a function

                          l(w) + l − 1 + i ai if wα0 = −α0 .


Theorem 6.1 For every regular integral dominant weight λ ∈ P̃+ and for every
element w ∈ W̃ ,

                  i                  0         if i 6= s(w)

                                     V−wλ+ρ̃ if i = s(w).

Proof. As in the classical case, we prove the theorem by induction on the length
of elements of the affine Weyl group W̃ .
    (a) First of all we verify the assertion in the case of maximal length elements,
l(w) = l + 1, w Π̃ = −Π. Hence w = ̟.

      From the discussed properties of the functor H one deduces easily that
                         H(L−̟λ) ∼
                                 = H(L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ ⊗ V−λ+ρ̃ )χλ ,
where the index χλ means the submodule, where the operators z − χλ (z) act
nilpotently, for all z ∈ Z(k̃) = cent U(k̃), and χλ the infinitesimal character
corresponding to λ.
    In Section 3 we have seen that
                      Ri S(Wχλ ) ∼
                                 = (Ri S(W ))χλ , W ∈ C(k̃, H̃),
                           Ri S(W ⊗ Vλ ) ∼
                                         = Ri S(W ) ⊗ Vλ .
Hence, we have
                Ri S(H(L−̟λ+ρ̃ )) ∼
                                  = Ri S((H(L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ ) ⊗ V−λ+ρ̃ ))χλ
        = (Ri S(H(L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ ) ⊗ V−λ+ρ̃ ))χλ ∼
        ∼                                  = (Ri S(H(L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ )) ⊗ V−λ+ρ̃ )χλ .
Therefore it is enough to compute Ri S(H(L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ ))χλ . We have
                                    M
              Ri S(H(L̟ρ̃+ρ̃ )) = (   Vλ ⊗ H i (ñ; L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ ⊗ V ∗ ))χ0

                                                  = V0 ⊗ H i (ñ; L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ ),
where ñ := ñ+ ⊕ ñ− , ∧i n+ has no vectors of weight −̟ ρ̃ + ρ̃, if i 6= s(w). If
i = s(w), we have
                           ∧s(w) ñ = (∧s(w) ñ)−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ ⊕ . . .
and
                                H s(w)(ñ; L−̟ρ̃+ρ̃ ) = C.
The theorem is verified in this case. Remark that here we have the non-triviality
of the cohomology group in dimension s(w), while in the classical case the non-
triviality in the dimension l(w).
    (b) Suppose that l(w) < l + 1 and that the theorem is verified for all w ′ ∈ W̃ ,
such that
                                  l(w ′ ) ≥ l(w) + 1.
Consider Q̃ = w P̃ . Then wλ is Q̃-dominant, integral and regular. Because Q̃ 6=
 ˜ + , there exists a Q̃-simple root α from ∆
w∆                                          ˜ + , such that hλ, αi > 0. Because

                                    sα Q̃ ⊇ Q̃ − {α},
then wλ and sα wλ are P1 -dominant, where P̃1 = Q̃ − {α}.

Lemma 6.1 Suppose that λ ∈ P̃ is regular integral weight. Then there exists a
unique root system Q such that λ is dominant weight. Suppose that ther exists a
Q-simple root α ∈ ∆ ˜ + ∪ Q such that hλ, αi > 0 and that the both elements λ and
λ′ = sα λ are (Q − {α})-dominant. Then in the category O there exists such an
object E that :
   (i) the sequence
                           0 → Mλ → E → Mλ′ → 0
is exact and
    (ii) Ri S(E) = 0, ∀i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., where Mλ = U(k̃) ⊗U (b̃) Lλ−ρ̃ is the Verma
modules associated to λ.

Proof. This lemma is an affine analogue of Lemma 6.2 from [3] and its proof does
not require an essential change.                                              


     End of the proof of Theorem 6.1.
     From this lemma, by changing λ 7→ wλ, there exists a module E ∈ O satis-
fying (i) and (ii). Then E has the finite dimensional weight spaces with respect to
h̃. Hence we have an exact sequence

                         0 → Ms∼α wλ → E ∼ → Mwλ
                                              ∼
                                                 → 0.

In virtue of the duality theorem, we have

                        Ri S(E ∼ ) = Ri S(E)≈ = 0, ∀i ∈ N.

From the long exact sequence, one has
                                 ∼ ∼
                           Ri S(Mwλ ) = Ri+1 S(Ms∼α wλ ).

Remark that
                                   ∼
                                  Mwλ = H(L−wλ+ρ̃),
                            Ms∼α wλ = H(L−sαwλ+ρ̃ )        .
Hence
                                                     

i.e.                                        
                                                0           if i 6= s(w)
                  R S(H(L−wλ+ρ̃)) ∼
                    i
                                  =
                                                V−λ+ρ̃      if i = s(w).
The theorem is completely proved.                                                 
   As usually, changing λ by λ + ρ̃, we have

                        δi,s(w) V−λ = Ri S(H(L−w(λ+ρ̃)+ρ̃ ))

                        ∼
                        = V−λ ⊗ H i (ñ; L−w(λ+ρ̃)+ρ̃ ⊗ Vλ∗ )H̃

                  ∼
                  = V−λ ⊗ HomU (h̃) (L∗−w(λ+ρ̃)−ρ̃ , H i (ñ; V−λ
                                                               ∗
                                                                  ))H̃ .
Hence we have just an affine analogue of the Kostant theorem on cohomology of
the nilpotent part.

Theorem 6.2
                        H i (ñ+ ; V ) ∼
                                              M
                                       =                  Lw(λ+ρ̃)−ρ̃
                                           w∈W̃ ,s(w)=i


Remark. We have deal with (k̃, H̃)-modules and the central characters of type
eλ and the infinitesimal characters of type χλ . A similar situation with (g̃, K̃)-
modules with the central characters of Harish-Chandra type θλ and the infinitesi-
mal characters χλ gives us an algebraic realization of the discrete series represen-
tations for loop groups. This idea will be devoted the next part of our contribution.
