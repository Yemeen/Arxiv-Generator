                                                 Suppose G is a real reductive Lie group in Harish-Chandra’s class (see [6,
                                            §3]). We propose here a structure for the set Πu (G) of equivalence classes of
                                            irreducible unitary representations of G. (The subscript u will be used through-
                                            out to indicate structures related to unitary representations.) We decompose
                                            Πu (G) into disjoint subsets with a (very explicit) discrete parameter set Λu :
                                                                                    [
                                            (0.1)                       Πu (G) =        Πλuu (G).
                                                                                      λu ∈Λu

                                            Each subset is identified conjecturally (Conjecture 0.6) with a collection of
                                            unitary representations of a certain subgroup G(λu ) of G. (We will give strong
                                            evidence and partial results for this conjecture.) In this way the problem of
                                            classifying Πu (G) would be reduced (by induction on the dimension of G) to
                                            the case G(λu ) = G.
                                                 Before considering the general program in more detail, we describe it in
                                            the familiar case G = SL(2, R). (This example will be treated more com-

pletely in Example 6.2 below.) The parameter set Λu is Z. If n is a nonzero
integer, then G(n) = SO(2), and Πnu (G) consists of a single discrete series rep-
resentation (with Harish-Chandra parameter n + sgn n and lowest SO(2)-type
n + 2 sgn n). The corresponding representation of SO(2) is the character usu-
ally parametrized by n. If n = 0, then G(0) = SL(2, R), and Π0u (G) consists of
all the remaining unitary representations: those containing an SO(2) character
parametrized by 0, ±1, or ±2. (These are the principal series, the complemen-
tary series, the trivial representation, and the first two discrete series.)
      At first glance it might appear natural to separate also the first two dis-
crete series as isolated points in the parametrization. But recall that these
representations are not isolated in the unitary dual of SL(2, R); rather they are
limits of complementary series. The decomposition we have given is consistent
with the topology of Πu (G), and separating the first two discrete series would
not be.
      As the example of SL(2, R) indicates, our “reduction” to the case G(λu )
= G is in some ways not very powerful; almost all of the interesting phenomena
are swept into that case. Nevertheless there is some content in these ideas.
In a separate paper, the first author will show how to use them to deduce
an old conjecture classifying unitary representations with sufficiently regular
infinitesimal character.

    We turn now to a description of the decomposition (??) in general. Choose
a Cartan involution θ of G, with fixed points K a maximal compact subgroup
of G. The real Lie algebra g0 then acquires a Cartan decomposition
(0.2a)                            g0 = k0 + p0 ,
with p0 the −1 eigenspace of (the differential of) θ. The complexification of g0
is written
(0.2b)                            g = g 0 ⊗ R C;
similar notation is used for other groups. Fix a nondegenerate G-invariant,
θ-invariant symmetric bilinear form h , i on g0 , negative definite on k0 and
positive definite on p0 . We will use the same notation for the complexification
of h , i (a complex-valued form on g), as well as its various restrictions and
dualizations.
     Our partition of representations of G is in terms of their restrictions to K;
so we begin by recalling the highest weight theory for representations of K.
     Fix a maximal torus T c ⊂ K. The abelian group Tbc of characters of T c
will be identified (by passing to differentials) with a lattice of imaginary-valued
linear functionals on the real Lie algebra:
(0.3a)                             Tbc ⊂ i(tc0 )∗ .
                 CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       1069

Because the form h , i was chosen to be negative definite on k0 , it is positive
definite on i(tc0 )∗ . The roots of T c in k and the weights of T c in g are characters
of T c , and so will be regarded as elements of i(tc0 )∗ . Choose a system of positive
roots

(0.3b)                          ∆+ (k, tc ) ⊂ ∆(k, tc ).

The Weyl group of T c in K is by definition the normalizer of T c in K divided
by the centralizer:

(0.3c)                    W (K, T c ) = NK (T c )/ZK (T c ).

Since K need not be connected, this group may be larger than the Weyl group
W (k, tc ) of the root system. Obviously W (K, T c ) acts on the root system
∆(k, tc ), so we can define

(0.3d)          R(G) = {w ∈ W (K, T c ) | w∆+ (k, tc ) = ∆+ (k, tc )}

(see [16, Def. 5.1.2]). The notation is chosen to reflect the fact that R(G)
is closely related to the R-group of Knapp and Stein. Notice that if G is
connected, then R(G) is trivial. There is a semidirect product decomposition

(0.3e)                      W (K, T c ) = R(G)W (k, tc )

with the second factor normal. Each root α in ∆(k, tc ) corresponds to an
eigenspace kα of Ad(T c ) on the complexified Lie algebra. We define
                               X
(0.3f)               nk =           kα ,     bk = nk + tc ;
                              α∈∆+ (k,tc )

this is a Borel subalgebra of k.

     Lemma 0.1 (See [16], Prop. 5.1.9). Using the notation of (0.3), suppose
V is a finite-dimensional complex representation of the Lie algebra k. The set
of highest weights of V is by definition the set of weights of tc acting on V nk ,
a subset of (tc )∗ .
 a) If V is an irreducible representation of k, then V nk has dimension one, so
     V has exactly one highest weight.
 b) The element µ ∈ (tc )∗ is the highest weight of an irreducible representation
     of k if and only if µ is dominant integral for k: that is,

                                     2hµ, αi/hα, αi ∈ N

    for all α ∈ ∆+ (k, tc ).
 c) Suppose V is a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of K. Then
    the collection of highest weights of V is a single orbit of R(G) on Tbc ⊂
    i(tc0 )∗ (cf. (0.3d)).

       Write

(0.4a)                   hc0 = gT0 = kT0 + pT0 = tc0 + ac0 ,

a fundamental Cartan subalgebra of g0 . We will be interested not so much in
the roots of hc in g as in their restrictions to tc : the nonzero weights of T c on
g. Define

(0.4b)            ∆(p, tc ) = set of nonzero weights of T c on p.

These weights all occur with multiplicity one. Define

(0.4c)                     ∆(g, tc ) = ∆(p, tc ) ∪ ∆(k, tc ),

a subset with multiplicities in i(tc0 )∗ . One can find fairly detailed structural
information about this set for example in [15, §2]. We mention here only a
few highlights. First, ∆(g, tc ) is a (possibly nonreduced) root system. The
elements having multiplicity one are the restrictions of imaginary roots of hc ;
each is compact or noncompact. The roots having multiplicity two are the
restrictions of complex roots; each corresponds to one root in k and one in p.
The Weyl group W (g, tc ) of ∆(g, tc ) may be identified with the stabilizer of tc
in W (g, hc ); it contains W (K, T c ).
     Whenever u ⊂ g is a T c -invariant subspace, we write ∆(u, tc ) for the set
of weights of T c in u, counted with multiplicities. Define
                                        X
(0.4d)                      2ρ(u) =          γ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ .
                                       γ∈∆(u,tc )

As a character of T c , this is the determinant of the adjoint action on u. As a
weight for the Lie algebra tc , it is the trace of the adjoint action on u. We will
make particular use of

(0.4e)                                2ρ(nk ) = 2ρc ,

the sum of the positive roots of T c in k (see (0.3)).

     We turn now to the definition of the partition 0.1 of the unitary dual. We
will say more about the motivations behind the construction in Section 2, but
here we mention just three primary sources: the notion of lowest K-type in [15];
the geometric reformulation of that notion by Carmona in [3]; and a charac-
terization used by the first author of the lowest K-types of the representations
Aq (λ) studied in [18].
     Fix a highest weight µ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ . Choose a system of positive roots ∆+ (g, tc )
for ∆(g, tc ) making µ + 2ρc dominant:

(0.5a)                 hµ + 2ρc , γi ≥ 0,           γ ∈ ∆+ (g, tc ).
                  CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                        1071

Because µ is dominant for K and 2ρc is dominant and regular, ∆+ (g, tc ) nec-
essarily contains ∆+ (k, tc ). Define
                                      X
(0.5b)                           2ρ =     γ,
                                         γ∈∆+ (g,tc )

the sum of the positive roots. This positive system defines a positive Weyl
chamber
(0.5c)            C = {φ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ | hφ, γi ≥ 0        (γ ∈ ∆+ (g, tc ))}.
This is a closed convex cone in the Euclidean space i(tc0 )∗ . We may therefore
define a projection P from i(tc0 )∗ onto C: P φ is the unique element of C closest
to φ. (This classical construction will be considered carefully in Section 1.)
Using P , we can now define
(0.5d)                       λu (µ) = P (µ + 2ρc − 2ρ).
This is an element of the positive Weyl chamber C ⊂ it∗0 ; we will see in Propo-
sition 1.4 that it is independent of the choice of positive root system subject
to (0.5a). By (0.5a), µ + 2ρc lies in C; so by definition of P ,
                             |λu (µ) − (µ + 2ρc )| ≤ |2ρ|.
Consequently the distance from µ to λu (µ) may be bounded independently of
µ (say by |2ρ| + |2ρc |). Because the weights µ lie in a (discrete) lattice in i(tc0 )∗ ,
it follows that the set
(0.5e)                   Λu = {λu (µ), µ ∈ Tbc dominant}
is discrete in i(tc0 )∗ . It is very easy to check that the group R(G) acts on Λu .
     We can now define the decomposition (0.1).

     Definition 0.2.    Fix λu ∈ Λu . The set of K-types attached to λu is
                  b | δ has a highest weight µ ∈ Tbc such that λu (µ) = λu }.
  Buλu (G) = {δ ∈ K
The set of unitary representations of G attached to λu is
         Πλuu (G) = {(π, Hπ ) ∈ Πu (G) | π has a lowest K-type in Buλu (G)}.
    It will sometimes be convenient (especially in our consideration of the Fell
topology in Section 8) to abuse notation by writing
                                      λu (π) = λu
when π ∈ Πλuu (G). The difficulty is that π may belong to several different
 λ′
Πuu (G). Corollary 0.4 below says that λu (π) is well-defined as an orbit of
R(G), but not (unless G is connected) as an element of i(tc0 )∗ .
1072           SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


     The definition of lowest K-type is given in [15, Def. 5.1], or [16, Def.
5.4.18]; we will recall it in Section 2.
     Proposition 0.3.        Suppose µ and µ′ are highest weights of lowest K-
types of a single irreducible representation of G. Then the weights λu (µ) and
λu (µ′ ) lie in the same orbit of R(G) (cf. (0.3)).
       We will prove this at the end of Section 3.
      Corollary 0.4.      Suppose λu and λ′u belong to Λu (cf. (0.5)). If λu
                                                           λ′
and λ′u belong to the same orbit of R(G), then Πλuu (G) = Πuu (G). If not, then
               λ′
Πλuu (G) and Πuu (G) are disjoint.
     To get a partition as described in (0.1), we could, of course, replace Λu
by a fundamental domain for the action of R(G); but since there is no natural
choice for such a fundamental domain, it is more convenient for us to leave
matters in this form.
     Next, we want to describe the group G(λu ) discussed after (0.1). The root
space decomposition of k implies that
                                  k0 = tc0 ⊕ [tc0 , k0 ],
and therefore that
(0.6a)                         g0 = tc0 ⊕ [tc0 , k0 ] ⊕ p0 .
By means of this decomposition any linear functional on tc0 extends canonically
to g0 , by making it zero on the other summands. In this way we can identify
i(tc0 )∗ naturally as a subspace of ig∗0 :
(0.6b)                              i(tc0 )∗ ֒→ ig∗0 .
The group G acts on ig∗0 by the coadjoint action. In the same way T c (or even
its normalizer in G) acts on it∗0 , and the inclusion 0.6(b) is T c -equivariant.
Since T c is abelian, it follows that T c acts trivially on the image. For any
λ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ ⊂ ig∗0 , define
(0.6c)            G(λ) = isotropy group at λ for the G action;
this is a subgroup of G containing T c . It is easy to check that the Cartan
involution θ preserves G(λ); and that G(λ) is a reductive group in Harish-
Chandra’s class, with Cartan involution θ|G(λ) .
     The set of roots of T c in G(λ) is
(0.6d)               ∆(g(λ), tc ) = {γ ∈ ∆(g, tc ) | hγ, λi = 0}.
We can therefore construct a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra q(λ) = g(λ) + u(λ)
by the following requirement (compare [16, Def. 5.2.1], and [9, Prop. 4.76]):
(0.6e)               ∆(u(λ), tc ) = {γ ∈ ∆(g, tc ) | hγ, λi > 0}.
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                    1073

     Using the parabolic subalgebra q(λ), we define functors of cohomological
parabolic induction Lj (λ) carrying (g(λ), G(λ)∩ K)-modules to (g, K)-modules
(see [9, §5.1], or [16, Def. 6.3.1]). These are most interesting in the degree
(0.6f)                         S = dim(u(λ) ∩ k).
At the same time, we have LK
                           j (λ) carrying (G(λ) ∩ K)-modules to K-modules
([9, §5.6]).

    Proposition 0.5.       With notation as in Definition 0.2 and (0.6), the
functor LK
         S (λu ) implements a bijection from Buλu (G(λu )) onto Buλu (G).

     We will prove this in Section 3 (Proposition 3.1). The aim of this paper
is a corresponding result for unitary representations:

     Conjecture 0.6. With notation as in Definition 0.2 and (0.6), the functor
LS (λu ) implements a bijection from Πλuu (G(λu )) onto Πλuu (G).

     In Section 5 we will explain a program for proving this conjecture, reducing
it to the more elementary Conjecture 5.7′ . We present strong evidence for the
validity of this latter conjecture, including Proposition 7.12 (which is a partial
result towards it) and Theorem 5.9 (which provides moral support for the
formulation of the conjecture). The program leads to an alternative description
of the subsets Πλuu (G) (Theorem 5.8(c)). This description will imply that each
is an open and closed subset of Πu (G), and that the bijection in Conjecture
0.6 is a homeomorphism in the Fell topology. We will examine these issues in
Section 8.


                      1. Projections on convex cones

     In this section we recall some elementary general results about projections
on convex cones. They will be applied to positive Weyl chambers in i(tc0 )∗ ,
with notation as described in the introduction. The ideas and the exposition
are taken from [3]. Throughout this section, V will be a finite-dimensional
real vector space, endowed with a positive definite inner product h , i. Write
|v| = hv, vi1/2 for the corresponding Hilbert space norm on V . Let C be a
closed convex cone in V . Write
(1.1)              C o = {v ∈ V | hv, ci ≥ 0,   for all c ∈ C}
for the dual cone; it is again a closed convex cone in V .

     Proposition 1.1 (See [3, Prop. 1.2]).   Suppose v ∈ V . Then there is
a unique element c0 of C closest to v. It may be characterized by any of the
following equivalent conditions.
1074          SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


 a) For any c ∈ C, |v − c0 | ≤ |v − c|.
 b) For any c ∈ C, hv − c0 , c − c0 i ≤ 0.
 c) The vector c0 − v belongs to the dual cone C o , and hc0 − v, c0 i = 0.

       We omit the elementary proof.

     Definition 1.2. In the setting of Proposition 1.1, the element c0 of C
satisfying the equivalent conditions (a)–(c) is written P v, the projection of v
on C.

     We will need some additional properties of the projection P that depend
on special properties of Weyl chambers. We therefore assume for the rest of
this section that we are given a (possibly nonreduced) root system
(1.2a)                                        ∆ ⊂ V,
and a set of positive roots
(1.2b)                                       ∆+ ⊂ ∆.
We do not assume that ∆ spans V . Write Vs for the linear span of ∆ in
V , and Vz for its orthogonal complement. (The subscripts s and z stand for
“semisimple” and “central.”) Write
(1.2c)                        Π = {α1 , . . . , αl } ⊂ ∆+
for the simple roots; these form a basis of Vs . Write ξi for the dual basis of
fundamental weights:
(1.2d)              hξi , αj i = δij ,          hξi , vi = 0 (v ∈ Vz ).
The closed positive Weyl chamber is by definition
(1.2e)                C = {v ∈ V | hv, αi ≥ 0                (α ∈ ∆+ )}
                                   l
                                   X
                         = Vz +              R≥0 ξi .
                                   i=1

Occasionally it will be useful to emphasize the dependence on the choice of
positive root system; in that case we will write C(∆+ ). The dual cone (cf. (1.1))
is
                                               l
                                               X
                                         o
(1.2f)                             C =                R≥0 αi ,
                                                i=1

the cone of positive roots. We will refer to this collection of notation and
assumptions as “the setting 1.2.”
    The main construction we use in this paper is (0.5d): to begin with a
dominant weight, subtract a dominant weight, then project onto the positive

Weyl chamber. The following lemma will lead to several important properties
of this construction.

    Lemma 1.3.       In the setting 1.2, suppose γ ∈ C is a dominant weight,
α ∈ Π is a simple root, and v ∈ V . If hv, αi ≤ 0, then
                               hP (v − γ), αi = 0.

    Proof. By Proposition 1.1, we may write
(1.3a)                    v − γ = P (v − γ) − e(v, γ),
with e(v, γ) ∈ C o orthogonal to P (v − γ). By 1.2(f), this means
                                   X
(1.3b)                   e(v, γ) =    ci αi   (ci ≥ 0),
                                    i

and ci > 0 implies hαi , P (v−γ)i = 0. Now form the inner product of (1.3a) with
α. The hypothesis on v and the dominance of γ make the left side nonpositive.
The first term on the right is nonnegative. If it is zero we are done; so we may
assume it is positive. Then
(1.3c)                          hα, e(v, γ)i > 0.
Distinct simple roots have nonpositive inner product; so (1.3b) and (1.3c) imply
that the coefficient ci of α in (1.3b) must be strictly positive. We have already
seen that this implies α is orthogonal to P (v − γ), as we wished to show.
     Proposition 1.4.    In the setting 1.2, fix a dominant weight γ ∈ C.
Define a map Tγ from V to V as follows. Given v ∈ V , choose a positive root
system ∆+ (v) making v dominant; write ∆+ (v) = σ∆+ , with σ ∈ W (∆) (the
Weyl group). Define
                          Tγ (v) = P (∆+ (v))(v − σγ).
Then Tγ (v) is well-defined (independent of the choice of positive root system
making v dominant).
    Recall that this result was used in (0.5d).

     Proof. Suppose w∆+ (v) is another positive system making v dominant.
Then v and w−1 v are both dominant for ∆+ (v), and are conjugate by the Weyl
group; so they coincide. Consequently w fixes v. Using w∆+ (v) to define Tγ (v)
leads to
 P (w∆+ (v))(v − wσγ) = P (w∆+ (v))(wv − wσγ) = w(P (∆+ (v))(v − σγ)).
     By Chevalley’s theorem (see for example [9, Prop. 4.146]) w is a product
of reflections in simple roots orthogonal to v. By Lemma 1.3, each such simple
1076          SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


root is orthogonal to P (∆+ (v))(v − σγ). So w fixes P (∆+ (v))(v − σγ), and we
get finally
                 P (w∆+ (v))(v − wσγ) = P (∆+ (v))(v − σγ),
as we wished to show.

     The next result will be used in Section 2 to relate the parameter λu (µ)
defined in (0.5) to the parameter λ(µ) constructed in [15, Prop. 4.1] or [16,
Prop. 5.3.3]. This will lead directly to Proposition 0.3, and to a variety of
stronger properties of the sets Πλuu (G).

    Proposition 1.5. In the setting 1.2, suppose v, γ, and δ are all domi-
nant weights in C. Then

                        P (v − γ − δ) = P (P (v − γ) − δ).

       Proof. Write

(1.4a)                    P (v − γ) = (v − γ) + e(v, γ),

with e(v, γ) ∈ C o orthogonal to P (v − γ) (Proposition 1.1(c)). Next, write

(1.4b)         P (P (v − γ) − δ) = (P (v − γ) − δ) + e(P (v − γ), δ),
with e(P (v − γ), δ) ∈ C o orthogonal to P (P (v − γ) − δ). Combining these two
equations gives

(1.4c)         P (P (v − γ) − δ) = (v − γ − δ) + e(v, γ) + e(P (v − γ), δ).

The last term on the right is orthogonal to P (P (v − γ) − δ) by 1.4(b). The
second is orthogonal to P (v−γ) by 1.4(a), and therefore also to P (P (v−γ)−δ)
by Lemma 1.3. We have therefore shown that e(v, γ) + e(P (v − γ), δ) is an
element of C o orthogonal to P (P (v−γ)−δ). By Proposition 1.1(c), the formula
in 1.4(c) now shows that

                        P (v − γ − δ) = P (P (v − γ) − δ),

as desired.

    Corollary 1.6.       In the setting 1.2, suppose γ and δ are dominant
weights in C. Define maps Tγ , etc., as in Proposition 1.4. Then

                                 Tγ+δ = Tγ ◦ Tδ .

     The next result will be used in the characterization of the K-types at-
tached to the parameter 0 (Definition 0.2), for which Conjecture 0.6 gives no
information. It is exactly analogous to [3, Cor. 2.13].
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                    1077

    Proposition 1.7.       In the setting 1.2, suppose v and γ are dominant
weights in C. The following conditions are equivalent.
 a) P (v − γ) = 0.
 b) The weight γ − v belongs to C o ; that is, it is a sum of positive roots with
    nonnegative coefficients.
 c) The weight v belongs to the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of γ.
    Proof. The equivalence of (a) and (b) follows from Proposition 1.1(c).
That (b) and (c) are equivalent is a well-known aspect of the Cartan-Weyl
theory of finite-dimensional representations; but since it is not easy to find a
convenient reference, we give a proof. The main step is
    Lemma 1.8 ([16, Lemma 6.3.28]).       Suppose γ ∈ C is dominant and
σ ∈ W (∆). Then there is an element e(σ) ∈ C o so that
                                 σ · γ = γ − e(σ).

      Using this lemma, we proceed with the proof of the proposition. Suppose
                             P                              P
first that (c) holds; say v = σ∈W cσ σ · γ, with cσ ≥ 0 and   cσ = 1. Adding
the equations in Lemma 1.8 gives
                                     X
                              v=γ−        cσ e(σ).
                                            σ
Since Co  is a convex cone, the last sum belongs to C o , as we wished to show.
     Conversely, suppose v is not in the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of
γ. Then it is separated from the convex hull by a hyperplane. That is, there
is an element λ′ ∈ V so that
                        hv, λ′ i > hσ · γ, λ′ i   (σ ∈ W ).
This inequality may be written as
                        hv, λ′ i > hγ, σ · λ′ i   (σ ∈ W ).
(We have replaced the variable σ by σ −1 ; since the inequality holds for all
σ ∈ W , this is permissible.) Now write λ for the dominant element of the
Weyl group orbit of λ′ , and λ′ = σ0 · λ. Then we have
                      hv, σ0 · λi > hγ, σ · λi       (σ ∈ W ).
(This time we have replaced σ by σσ0−1 .) Applying Lemma 1.8 to the dominant
weight λ, we find σ0 · λ = λ − e(σ0 ), with e(σ0 ) ∈ C o . Since v is dominant, it
has a nonnegative inner product with e(σ0 ). So we get
                        hv, λi > hγ, σ · λi       (σ ∈ W ).
Taking σ = 1, we find in particular
                                   hv − γ, λi > 0.

                                                        / C o , as we wished to
Since λ is dominant, this inequality implies that γ − v ∈
show.

       We can now give a convenient characterization of the map v 7→ P (v − γ).

     Corollary 1.9.        In the setting 1.2, suppose v and γ are dominant
weights in C. Let W0 be the Weyl group of roots orthogonal to P (v − γ) (the
stabilizer in W of P (v − γ)). Then v − P (v − γ) is dominant, and belongs to
the convex hull of the W0 orbit of γ.
     Conversely, suppose that v0 and γ are dominant weights in C. Let W0 be
the Weyl group of the roots orthogonal to v0 . Suppose γ0 is a dominant weight
in the convex hull of the W0 orbit of γ. Then v = v0 + γ0 is dominant, and
P (v − γ) = v0 .

      Proof. Write ∆0 for the system of roots orthogonal to P (v − γ). By
Proposition 1.1(c), v − γ − P (v − γ) is a sum of negative roots orthogonal to
P (v − γ); that is, a sum of roots in ∆−  0 . Now apply Proposition 1.7 to the
                             +
root system ∆0 and the ∆0 -dominant weight v − P (v − γ). The conclusion
is that v − P (v − γ) belongs to the convex hull of the W0 orbit of γ. Clearly
v − P (v − γ) is dominant for ∆+                         +     +
                                0 . The remaining set ∆ − ∆0 is permuted by
W0 . Since γ is dominant for these roots, the convex hull of W0 · γ must be as
well.
      The converse is similar but easier, and we leave it to the reader.

     Because we will most often use these results in the case γ = ρ (half the
sum of the positive roots), we will need a precise description of the convex hull
in that case.

     Proposition 1.10 ([10, Lemma 5.9]). In the setting of 1.2, write ρ for
half the sum of the positive roots. Then the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit
of ρ coincides with the set R of all weights of the form
                          X
                     r=        cα α,    (−1/2 ≤ cα ≤ 1/2).
                         α∈∆+

Equivalently, these are the weights
                              X
                     r =ρ−          bα α,    (0 ≤ bα ≤ 1).
                                α∈∆+




                     2. Classification by lowest K-types

     In this section we recall part of the Langlands classification of admissible
irreducible representations of G, as reformulated in [15], [16], and [3].
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                     1079

     Definition 2.1. Suppose G is a reductive group in Harish-Chandra’s class.
The admissible dual of G is the set Πa (G) of infinitesimal equivalence classes
of irreducible admissible representations of G. Equivalently, Πa (G) may be
identified with the set of equivalence classes of irreducible (g, K)-modules ([16,
Def. 0.3.8]; here K is a maximal compact subgroup of G as in 0.2.).

     Most of the equivalence of these two definitions of Πa (G) is proved in
[5]. What is missing there is the proof that every irreducible (g, K)-module
appears as the space of K-finite vectors in an admissible representation. This
was proved for linear groups by Harish-Chandra, and in general by Lepowsky
and Rader independently (see for example [19, Th. 3.5.6]).

     Definition 2.2 ([15, Def. 5.1] or [16, Def. 5.4.18]). Suppose X ∈ Πa (G) is
an irreducible (g, K)-module. A lowest K-type of X is an irreducible represen-
tation δ ∈ Kb such that

 a) δ appears in the restriction of X to K, and
 b) if µ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ is a highest weight of δ (Lemma 0.4), then hµ + 2ρc , µ + 2ρc i
    (notation 0.4(e)) is minimal subject to (a).

     Obviously the norm in Definition 2.2(b) is independent of the choice of
highest weight of δ.
     The classification of admissible representations in [15] is based on the
following fact.

       Proposition 2.3 ([15, Prop. 4.1] or [16, Prop. 5.3.3]).         Suppose µ ∈
i(tc0 )∗ is dominant integral for ∆+ (k, tc ). Choose a positive root system ∆+ =
∆+ (g, tc ) making µ + 2ρc dominant (cf. (0.5a)). Write ρ for the corresponding
half sum of positive roots. Then there is a weight λa (µ) ∈ it∗0 with the following
properties.
 a) The weight λa (µ) is dominant for ∆+ .
 b) There is an orthogonal collection βi of positive imaginary roots such that
                                P
      i) λa (µ) = µ + 2ρc − ρ + i ci βi     (0 ≤ ci ≤ 1/2), and
     ii) hλa (µ), βi i = 0.

     Corollary 2.4 ([3, Th. 2.10]). In the notation of Proposition 2.3, the
weight λa (µ) is the projection of µ+2ρc −ρ on the cone C of dominant weights.
In the notation of Proposition 1.4, λa (µ) = Tρ (µ + 2ρc ). Consequently λa (µ)
is independent of the choice of ∆+ making µ + 2ρc dominant.

     Proof. Proposition 2.3 shows that λa (µ) satisfies the conditions in Propo-
sition 1.1(c) characterizing P (µ+2ρc −ρ). The remaining assertions now follow
from Proposition 1.4.
1080              SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


       In analogy with (0.5e), we may now define
(2.1)                       Λa = {λa (µ), µ ∈ Tbc dominant}.
The analogue of Definition 0.2 for admissible representations is:

       Definition 2.5.     Fix λa ∈ Λa . The set of K-types attached to λa is
                   b | δ has a highest weight µ ∈ Tbc such that λa (µ) = λa }.
   Baλa (G) = {δ ∈ K
The set of admissible representations of G attached to λa is
               Πλa a (G) = {π ∈ Πa (G) | π has a lowest K-type in Baλa (G)}.

    Just as in the case of Definition 0.2, we will abuse notation in Section 8
by writing
                                  λa (π) = λa
when π ∈ Πλa a (G). Again the difficulty is that π may belong to several different
  λ′
Πa a (G). It follows from Theorem 2.9 below that λa (π) is well-defined as an
orbit of R(G).

     Proposition 2.6. With notation as in Definition 2.5, (0.6), and (0.4d),
write Sa = dim u(λa )∩k. Then the functor LK
                                           Sa (λa ) implements a bijection from
  λ −ρ(u(λa ))
Ba a             (G(λa )) onto Baλa (G).

     This is essentially proved in [16], although some careful inspection of def-
initions is needed to verify that. Typical of the complications is the fact that
the functors LK S (λ) are not defined in [16]. Fortunately they are easy to de-
scribe in terms of highest weights: roughly speaking, they add 2ρ(u(λ) ∩ p) to
the highest weight. Here is a more precise statement.

    Lemma 2.7 ([9, Cor. 5.72]).          Suppose λ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ is dominant for
∆+ (k, tc ),
          so that u(λ) ∩ k ⊂ nk (notation (0.6e) and (0.3f)). Write R =
dim u(λ) ∩ p, so that ∧R (u(λ) ∩ p) is a one-dimensional representation of
G(λ) ∩ K. Suppose Z is an irreducible representation of G(λ) ∩ K, of highest
weight denoted µG(λ) ∈ Tbc , and V is an irreducible representation of K. Then

         HomK (LK                               R
                S (λ)(Z), V ) ≃ HomG(λ)∩K (Z ⊗ ∧ (u(λ) ∩ p), V
                                                               u(λ)∩k
                                                                      ).
     Define µG = µG(λ) + 2ρ(u(λ) ∩ p). If µG is dominant for K, then ev-
ery irreducible constituent of LK
                                S (λ)(Z) has highest weight µG . If µG is not
dominant for K, then LK  S (λ)(Z) = 0.

     Given this description of the functor LK
                                            S (λ), the translation from Lemma
6.5.4 in [16] to Proposition 2.6 above is more or less straightforward; we omit
the details.
                 CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                      1081

    In order to formulate the classification of admissible representations, we
need one more ingredient.
    Proposition 2.8 ([9, Th. 5.80]).     In the setting (0.6), suppose Z is a
(g(λ), G(λ) ∩ K)-module. Then there is a natural injective map of K-modules
                             BZ : LK
                                   S (λ)(Z) → LS (λ)(Z).

     This map is called the bottom layer map for Z, for reasons explained in
Section 5.6 of [9].
     Theorem 2.9 ([16, Th. 6.5.12]).             Suppose λa ∈ Λa (cf. (2.1)). Then
there is a natural bijection
(2.2)                      Πaλa −ρ(u(λa )) (G(λa )) → Πλa a (G)
                                                        λ −ρ(u(λ ))
(Def. 2.5) defined as follows. Suppose Za ∈ Πa a           a
                                                              (G(λa )) is an irre-
ducible (g(λa ), G(λa ) ∩ K)-module.
 a) The set of lowest G(λa ) ∩ K-types of Za consists precisely of those in
       λ −ρ(u(λa ))
    Ba a            (G(λa )).
 b) The set of lowest K-types of LSa (λa )(Za ) consists precisely of the image of
    the bottom layer map composed with LK  Sa (λa ) on the lowest G(λa )∩K-types
    of Za .
                        λ −ρ(u(λ ))
     Let δG(λa ) ∈ Ba a      a
                                (G(λa )) be an irreducible representation of the
group G(λa ) ∩ K appearing in Za , and let δ = LK   Sa (λa )(δG(λa ) ) be the corre-
                                      λ
sponding representation of K in Ba (G) (Prop. 2.6). By Proposition 2.8, δ
                                        a

must appear in LSa (λa )(Za ).
  c) There is a unique irreducible subquotient X of LSa (λa )(Za ) containing the
     K-type δ.
 d) The multiplicity of δ in X is equal to the multiplicity of δ in LSa (λa )(Za ),
     and to the multiplicity of δG(λa ) in Za .
  e) The subquotient X is independent of the choice of the representation δG(λa )
          λ −ρ(u(λ ))
       in Ba a      a
                      (G(λa )), subject to the requirement that δG(λa ) occur in Za .
       The bijection (2.2) sends Za to X.
       To construct the inverse map, suppose X is an irreducible (g, K)-module in
                                                                 λ −ρ(u(λa ))
Πλa a (G), having a lowest K-type δ ∈ Baλa (G). Let δG(λa ) ∈ Ba a            (G(λa ))
be the corresponding irreducible representation of G(λa )∩K (Prop. 2.6). Write
Ra = dim(u(λa ) ∩ p) as in Lemma 2.7.
  f) The representation δG(λa ) appears in the cohomology space H ∗ (u(λa ), X)
       (a (g(λa ), G(λa ) ∩ K))-module) exactly as often as δ appears in X; all
       occurrences are in degree Ra .
 g) There is a unique irreducible subquotient Za of H Ra (u(λa ), X) containing
       the G(λa ) ∩ K-type δG(λa ) .
1082           SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


 h) The subquotient Za is independent of the choice of δ ∈ Baλa (G), subject to
    the requirement that δ occur in X.
       The inverse of (2.2) sends X to Za .

     Just as for Proposition 2.6, some translation is required to pass from the
results in [16] to this one; but we omit the details.
     Because we are interested in unitary representations, we need to know how
the bijection of Theorem 2.9 affects Hermitian forms. Here is the underlying
machinery.

     Proposition 2.10 ([9, Th. 6.34]).        In the setting of (0.6), suppose Z
is a representation of G(λ) ∩ K. Then any invariant Hermitian form on Z
induces in a natural way a K-invariant Hermitian form on LK       S (λ)(Z). This
correspondence carries positive definite forms to positive definite forms, and
negative definite forms to negative definite forms.
     Suppose Z is actually a (g(λ), G(λ) ∩ K)-module. Then any invariant
Hermitian form on Z induces in a natural way a (g, K)-invariant Hermitian
form on LS (λ)(Z). The bottom layer map BZ of Proposition 2.8 is unitary;
that is, it respects these forms.

     Theorem 2.11.         The bijection of Theorem 2.9 preserves Hermitian
representations.      Explicitly, suppose Za is an irreducible Hermitian
(g(λa ), G(λa ) ∩ K)-module. Then the induced Hermitian form on LSa (λa )(Za )
descends to a nondegenerate form on the subquotient X containing the lowest
K-types.

     Unfortunately, the analogue of Theorem 2.11 with “Hermitian” replaced
by “unitary” is false. We know no examples in which Za is unitary and X is
not; but the other direction fails spectacularly and often. One of the simplest
examples has G = SOe (4, 1) and µ = 0 the highest weight of the trivial rep-
resentation of K. In this case G(λa ) = SO(2) × SOe (2, 1), and Theorem 2.9
relates spherical representations of G to representations of G(λa ) containing
the SO(2) × SO(2) representation C−1 ⊗ C0 . (The subscripts refer to the rep-
resentations of SO(2), which we index by Z as usual.) Then the representation
Za = C−1 ⊗ C3 of G(λa ) carries a Hermitian form of signature (1, 2); but the
corresponding irreducible representation X of G is the trivial representation.
     Here is how we propose to circumvent this problem. Suppose q = l + u is
a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra containing q(λa ). Using “induction by stages”
theorems, we can get analogues of Theorems 2.9 and 2.11 relating certain
representations of G to certain representations of L. These results are in some
sense weaker than those above, because they reduce problems about G not
to G(λa ), but only to the larger group L. On the other hand, and for the
same reason, a representation of L “remembers” more about the corresponding
                 CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                 1083

representation of G than the representation of G(λa ) does. For that reason, a
unitary version of Theorem 2.11 has a better chance to be true. An extreme
possibility is to take q = g; then L = G, so the “reduction” from G to L is
perfectly behaved but worthless. Our goal is to choose q large enough that the
reduction is well-behaved, but small enough that it is interesting.
     We begin with formalities. Fix λa ∈ Λa . A weight λ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ is called a
singularization of λa if for every root α ∈ ∆(g, tc ),
(2.3a)                       hλ, αi > 0 ⇒ hλa , αi > 0.
That is, we require that λ belong to the same closed positive Weyl chamber
as λa , and that it lie on at least as many walls. Another way to say the same
thing is: λ should belong to every closed positive Weyl chamber containing λa .
A consequence of (2.3a) is
(2.3b)                       hλa , αi = 0 ⇒ hλ, αi = 0.
By (0.6),
(2.3c)         u(λ) ⊂ u(λa ),      g(λa ) ⊂ g(λ),         q(λa ) ⊂ q(λ).
Because G is in Harish-Chandra’s class, it follows also that
(2.3d)                            G(λa ) ⊂ G(λ).
(To work with groups not in Harish-Chandra’s class, this condition should be
included as an additional assumption on λ. We will eventually apply these
formalities with λ = λu , the weight defined by (0.5) for some µ giving rise
to λa . In that case (2.3d) is automatically satisfied.) We have direct sum
decompositions like
(2.3e)                    u(λa ) = u(λ) + (u(λa ) ∩ g(λ)),
and similarly after intersection with k. We need two consequences of this
decomposition. First,
(2.3f)                ρ(u(λa )) = ρ(u(λ)) + ρ(u(λa ) ∩ g(λ))
as weights in i(tc0 )∗ (cf. (0.4d)). Next, if we define
(2.3g)              Sa = dim u(λa ) ∩ k,      S = dim u(λ) ∩ k,
then
(2.3h)                   dim(u(λa ) ∩ g(λ) ∩ k) = Sa − S.
We are going to be interested in cohomological induction functors related to
three parabolic subalgebras:
(2.4a)         LSa (λa ): (g(λa ), G(λa ) ∩ K)-modules → (g, K)-modules)
1084         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


(defined in terms of the parabolic subalgebra q(λa ));
(2.4b)        LS (λ): (g(λ), G(λ) ∩ K)-modules → (g, K)-modules
(defined in terms of the parabolic subalgebra q(λ)); and
(2.4c) LSa −S (λa , λ): (g(λa ), G(λa ) ∩ K)-modules → (g(λ), G(λ) ∩ K)-modules
(defined in terms of the parabolic subalgebra q(λa ) ∩ g(λ)). Similarly, we have
the corresponding functors for compact group representations.

     Proposition 2.12 ([9, Th. 11.77).           In the setting of (2.3) and (2.4),
there are natural equivalences
                                                                     G(λ)∩K
  LSa (λa ) ≃ LS (λ) ◦ LSa −S (λa , λ),    LK           K
                                            Sa (λa ) ≃ LS (λ) ◦ LSa −S (λa , λ).

These equivalences respect the bottom layer maps of Proposition 2.8 and the
Hermitian forms of Proposition 2.10.

     What is established in [9] is a composition-of-functors spectral sequence.
The equivalence here appears as a corner of that spectral sequence, because
the various cohomological induction functors all vanish above the degrees in
the proposition. (A careful reader may notice that the assertions about bottom
layer maps and Hermitian forms are not actually stated or proved in [9]. In
any case they are stated here only for moral support; we will make no use of
them.)
     Using Proposition 2.12, it is a simple matter to extend Proposition 2.6
and Theorems 2.9 and 2.11 to apply to q(λ) instead of q(λa ).

     Theorem 2.13.       Suppose λa ∈ Λa , and there is fixed a singularization
λ of λa (cf. (2.3) and (2.4)).
                                                                λ −ρ(u(λ))
 a) The functor LKS (λ) implements a bijection from Ba
                                                       a
                                                                             (G(λ)) onto
    Baλa (G).
 b) There is a natural bijection
                             Πaλa −ρ(u(λ)) (G(λ)) → Πλa a (G)
                                                 λ −ρ(u(λ))
    defined as follows. Suppose that Z ∈ Πa a           (G(λ)) is an irreducible
    (g(λ), G(λ) ∩ K)-module. Then the corresponding (g, K)-module X is the
    unique irreducible subquotient of LS (λ)(Z) containing K-types in Baλa (G).
    Conversely, given X ∈ Πλa a (G), put R = dim(u(λ) ∩ p). Then we assign to
    X the unique irreducible subquotient Z of H ∗ (u(λ), X) containing G(λ) ∩
                  λ −ρ(u(λ))
    K-types in Ba a          (G(λ)); it appears in degree R.
 c) The bijection of (b) preserves Hermitian representations.
                    λ−ρ(u(λ))
 d) Suppose Z ∈ Πa            (G(λ)) is an irreducible Hermitian (g(λ), G(λ) ∩
    K)-module. Then the image of the bottom layer map BZ (Prop. 2.8) maps
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                    1085

    injectively to the irreducible subquotient X described in (b). On these
    K-types, the signature of the Hermitian form on X therefore corresponds
    precisely to the signature on Z.
                    λ−ρ(u(λ))
 e) Suppose Z ∈ Πa            (G(λ)) is an irreducible (g(λ), G(λ) ∩ K)-module,
    and the infinitesimal character of Z corresponds by the Harish-Chandra
    isomorphism to a weight φ ∈ h∗ . Assume that
                    Re hφ + ρ(u(λ)), αi ≥ 0        (α ∈ ∆(u(λ), h)).
    Then LS (λ)(Z) is irreducible.
 f) Under the assumptions of (e), suppose also that Z is unitary.           Then
    LS (λ)(Z) is unitary.
 g) Under the assumptions of (e), suppose also that
                      hφ + ρ(u(λ)), αi 6= 0      (α ∈ ∆(u(λ), h))
    and that LS (λ)(Z) is unitary. Then Z is unitary.

    Sketch of proof. For (a), Proposition 2.6 (applied to the groups G and
G(λ)) provides bijections

                   LK     λa −ρ(u(λa ))
                    Sa : Ba             (G(λa )) → Baλa (G),
               G(λ)∩K
              LSa −S : Baλa −ρ(u(λa )) (G(λa )) → Baλa −ρ(u(λ)) (G(λ)).

Now Proposition 2.12 implies that LK     S (λ) provides a bijection between the
ranges of these two maps. The proofs of (b) and (c) are similar; we omit
the details. Part (d) is the Signature Theorem of [9, Cor. 11.228]; (e) is the
Irreducibility Theorem of [9, Th. 8.7]; and (f) is the Unitarizability Theorem
of [9, Th. 9.1] or [17, Th. 1.3(a)]. Part (g) is [17, Th. 1.3(b)].



                 3. Relation to the unitary classification

     In this section we will relate the various sets defined for unitary represen-
tations in Definition 0.2 with the classification by lowest K-types described in
Section 2. We begin with a K-dominant weight µ ∈ Tbc as in (0.5), and a posi-
tive root system ∆+ (g, tc ) making µ + 2ρc dominant. Define ρ as in (0.5b), half
the sum of the positive roots. Recall from Corollary 2.4 that in the notation
of Proposition 1.4,
(3.1a)                        λa (µ) = Tρ (µ + 2ρc ).
The definition in (0.5d) may be written as
(3.1b)                        λu (µ) = T2ρ (µ + 2ρc ).
1086          SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


By Corollary 1.6,

(3.1c)               λu (µ) = Tρ ◦ Tρ (µ + 2ρc ) = Tρ (λa (µ)).

Lemma 1.3 (or Proposition 1.4) now implies that

(3.1d)         λu (µ) is a singularization of λa (µ) (notation 2.3).

This information leads immediately to a relationship between the sets of
K-types defined as in Definitions 0.2 and 2.5.

       Proposition 3.1.    Use the notation of (0.5), (2.1), and Proposition 1.4.
  a) Λu = Tρ (Λa ).
                S
  b) Buλu (G) = λa ∈Λa , Tρ (λa )=λu Baλa (G).
  c) In the notation of Theorem 2.13, the functor LK
                                                   Su (λu ) implements a bijec-
tion from Buλu (G(λu )) onto Buλu (G).

     Proof. Parts (a) and (b) are immediate from (3.1c) and the definitions.
For (c), we combine the description of Buλu (G) in (b) with Theorem 2.13(a)
(which applies because of (3.1d)). The conclusion is that LK
                                                           Su (λu ) implements
a bijection from           [
                                  Baλa −ρ(u(λu )) (G(λu ))
                            λa ∈Λa
                          Tρ (λa )=λu

onto Buλu (G). To complete the proof of (c), we need

    Lemma 3.2. In the setting of Proposition 3.1, suppose λ′a ∈ Λa (G(λu )).
Then the following two properties are equivalent.
 a) Tρ(g(λu )) (λ′a ) = λu .
 b) There is a λa ∈ Λa (G) such that Tρ (λa ) = λu , and λ′a = λa − ρ(u(λu )).

    Assuming this lemma for a moment, we see that the last union may be
rewritten as                [         ′
                                   Baλa (G(λu )).
                            λ′a ∈Λa (G(λu ))
                           Tρ(g(λu )) (λ′a )=λu

According to Proposition 3.1(b) (which we have already proved) this is pre-
cisely Buλu (G(λu )), as we wished to show.

     Proof of Lemma 3.2. Suppose first that (b) holds. Fix a positive root
system ∆+ (g, tc ) making λa dominant, and write ρ for half the sum of the
positive roots. Then

(3.2a)                      ρ = ρ(u(λu )) + ρ(g(λu )).
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                     1087

According to Proposition 1.1(c), the hypothesis that Tρ (λa ) = λu means that
λu is dominant for ∆+ (g, tc ), and that

(3.2b)               λu = (λa − ρ(u(λu ))) − ρ(g(λu )) + w,

with w a nonnegative combination of positive roots orthogonal to λu . But this
formulation also shows that if we set λ′a = λa − ρ(u(λu )), then

                                Tρ(g(λu )) (λ′a ) = λu .

So (a) is satisfied.
    Conversely, assume (a) holds. Choose a positive root system ∆+ (g(λu ), tc )
making λ′a dominant. Define

(3.2c)              ∆+ (g, tc ) = ∆+ (g(λu ), t) ∪ ∆(u(λu ), tc ).

Then (3.2a) still holds. Define

(3.2d)                         λa = λ′a + ρ(u(λu )).

By Proposition 1.1(c), the assumption (a) may be written as in (3.2b). This
looks at first as if it immediately implies (b) of the proposition. What is
missing is this. To compute Tρ (λa ), we must subtract from λa half the sum
of the positive roots for a system making λa dominant. We do not yet know
that λa is dominant for ∆+ (g, tc ). Here is a proof of that. Since λu is central
in G(λu ), we can apply Proposition 1.7 almost directly to the hypothesis (a).
The conclusion is

   λ′a − λu belongs to the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of ρ(g(λu )).

Of course the Weyl group in question is for ∆(g(λu ), tc ). This Weyl group fixes
ρ(u(λu )). We conclude that λa may be written as a convex combination
                                 X
                           λa =     cw (λu + wρ),

with w running over the Weyl group of ∆(g(λu ), tc ). Each summand here has
positive inner product with the roots in ∆(u(λu ), tc ), so λa does as well. On the
other hand it is immediate from (3.2d) that λa is dominant for ∆+ (g(λu ), t); so
we conclude that λa is actually dominant for ∆+ (g, tc ), as we wished to show.
Now (3.2b) does imply that Tρ (λa ) = λu , which is (b).

     Proof of Proposition 0.3. Write δ and δ′ for lowest K-types of π having
highest weights µ and µ′ . Define λa = λa (µ), and λ′a = λa (µ′ ). Use Theorem
2.9 and the K-type δ to write π as a subquotient of some LSa (λa )(Za ). Then
δ′ must be a lowest K-type of this cohomologically induced representation. By
Theorem 2.9(b), δ′ must also belong to Baλa (G). It is clear from Definition
1088         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


2.5 (and Lemma 1.4) that this implies that λ′a = r · λa , for some r ∈ R(G).
Consequently (3.1c) implies that

             λu (µ′ ) = Tρ (λ′a ) = Tρ (r · λa ) = r · Tρ (λa ) = r · λu (µ),

as we wished to show.



              4. Relation to ordinary parabolic induction

     In this section we consider the relationship between our results about
cohomological induction and those formulated with ordinary parabolic induc-
tion. We begin with the case to which Theorem 2.9 reduces the classification
of admissible representations.

     Proposition 4.1.        Suppose λa ∈ Λa (cf. (2.1)), and that G(λa ) = G.
Then G is quasisplit; that is, there is a Borel subgroup B q = T q Aq N q of G.
The Levi factor H q = T q Aq is a maximally split Cartan subgroup of G. After
replacing B q by a conjugate, we may assume that the identity component T0q
is contained in T c (cf. (0.3)). Then the linear functional λa vanishes on the
orthogonal complement of tq ⊂ tc , so it makes sense to write λa ∈ i(tq0 )∗ . An
irreducible representation γ ∈ Tbq is said to be fine of type λa if its differential
is a multiple of λa .
 a) Suppose δ ∈ Baλa (G). Then the restriction of δ to T q consists of fine
    representations of T q of type λa , belonging to a single orbit of W (G, H q ).
 b) The set Baλa (G) consists of all lowest K-types of the induced representa-
    tions IndK                                                   q
                T q (γ), as γ runs over fine representations of T of type λa .
 c) Suppose δ ∈ Baλa (G), and X ∈ Πλa a (G) is an irreducible admissible rep-
    resentation of lowest K-type δ. Let γ be any representation of T q ap-
    pearing in the restriction of δ. Then there is a character ν ∈ A         bq so
    that X is a Langlands subquotient of the principal series representation
    IndGT q Aq N q (γ ⊗ ν). In particular, the infinitesimal character of X has
    Harish-Chandra parameter (λa , ν) ∈ (tq )∗ + (aq )∗ .

     This is [16, Prop. 5.3.26, Th. 4.3.16, and Th. 4.4.8]. Inspection of the
proofs shows that what is claimed here does not use the assumption of abelian
Cartan subgroups. (That is needed for example to show that the restriction of
δ to T q decomposes with multiplicity one.)
     We turn now to general representations. So let λa ∈ Λa (G). Proposition
4.1 guarantees that G(λa ) is quasisplit. A little more precisely, Proposition 2.6
guarantees that

(4.1a)                           λ′a = λa − ρ(u(λa ))
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                      1089

belongs to Λa (G(λa )); and evidently
(4.1b)                           G(λa )(λ′a ) = G(λa ),
so we can apply Proposition 4.1. Pick a quasi-split Cartan subgroup
(4.1c)                      H(λa ) = T (λa )A(λa ) ⊂ G(λa )
as in Proposition 4.1. Just as in the proposition, we may regard λ′a , λa , and
ρ(u(λa )) as weights in it(λa )∗0 . Now consider the centralizer of A(λa ) in G.
Because A(λa ) is the vector part of the Cartan subgroup H(λa ), this centralizer
has a Langlands decomposition
(4.1d)                         GA(λa ) = M (λa )A(λa ).
Here M (λa ) is a θ-stable reductive subgroup of G containing T (λa ) as a com-
pact Cartan subgroup.
     Proposition 4.2.         In the setting 4.1, there are natural bijections among
the following three sets.
 a) Fine representations of T (λa ) of type λ′a (Proposition 4.1); that is, irre-
    ducible representations of T (λa ) of differential equal to a multiple of λ′a .
 b) Irreducible representations of T (λa ) of differential equal to a multiple of
    λa − ρ(m(λ)). Here the positive root system is the one for t(λa ) in m(λa )
    making λa dominant.
 c) Discrete series representations of M (λa ) of Harish-Chandra parameter λa .
     Proof. This result is analogous to Proposition 6.6.2 in [16]. To construct
the bijection between (a) and (b), consider the set of roots ∆(u(λa ), h(λa )).
The imaginary roots among these are precisely the positive roots of t(λa ) in
m(λa ). The remaining roots occur in pairs (α, θα). Choose one root from each
of these pairs, and list the choices as {α1 , . . . , αr }. Define
                                   X
                               τ=      αi ∈ T (λa )b.
                                       i
Because α and θα have the same restriction to T (λa ), the character τ is inde-
pendent of choices. Furthermore
                              ρ(u(λa )) = ρ(m(λa )) + dτ.
The bijection from (a) to (b) is just tensoring with τ . The bijection from (b) to
(c) is Harish-Chandra’s parametrization of the discrete series. In the context
of Section 2, the set in (c) turns out to be Πλa a (M (λa )), and the bijection with
(b) is precisely 2.2; that is, it is given by cohomological induction from T (λa )
to M (λa ). Details may be found in [9, §11.8].
    We can now formulate the relationship between Theorem 2.9 and the
parabolic induction version of the Langlands classification.

     Theorem 4.3 ([9 , Th. 11.225]). Suppose we are in the setting of (2.2),
and that the irreducible (g, K)-module X corresponds to Za . Use the notation
of (4.1), and fix a character γ q ⊗ ν of H(λa ) as in Proposition 4.1 so that
                                     G(λ )
Za is a Langlands quotient of IndH(λaa )N q (γ ⊗ ν). Let γ be the discrete series
representation of M (λa ) with Harish-Chandra parameter λa that corresponds
to γq in the bijection from (a) to (c) of Proposition 4.2. Choose a real parabolic
subgroup P = M (λa )A(λa )N of G making Re ν dominant for the a(λa )-weights
in n; and define N q = N ∩ G(λa ). Then
                                                
                                G(λ )
                  LSa (λa ) IndH(λaa )N q (γ ⊗ ν) ≃ IndG
                                                       P (γ ⊗ ν).

In particular, X is a Langlands quotient of IndG
                                               P (γ ⊗ ν).

      This is stated without complete proof in [16, Th. 6.6.15]; it was essentially
first proved in the unpublished second half of [15].
      Recall that the tempered representations constitute the closure (in the Fell
topology) of the support of the Plancherel measure. A tempered irreducible
representation is unitary, but unitary representations need not be tempered.

     Corollary 4.4. The bijection of Theorem 2.9 preserves tempered rep-
                                            λ −ρ(u(λa ))
resentations. Explicitly, suppose Za ∈ Πa a              (G(λa )) is an irreducible
tempered (g(λa ), G(λa ) ∩ K)-module. Then LSa (λa )(Za ) is an irreducible tem-
pered (g, K)-module in Πλa a (G); and every such tempered representation arises
in this way.

     Proof. The nature of the Langlands classification implies that a Lang-
lands quotient is tempered if and only if the continuous parameter ν is purely
imaginary (see for example [8, Th. 8.53]). Theorem 4.3 says that the bijection
of Theorem 2.9 preserves continuous parameters, so temperedness is also pre-
served. For the rest, the infinitesimal character of Za is given by the weight
(λa − ρ(u(λa )), ν) ∈ h(λa )∗ . When ν is purely imaginary, the dominance of
λa implies immediately that the condition in Theorem 2.13(e) is satisfied; so
LSa (λa )(Za ) is irreducible.



               5. The reduction step in the classification

     Theorem 2.13 and Proposition 3.1 together allow us to approach Con-
jecture 0.6. To see what we have, we consider first the case of Hermitian
representations.

    Definition 5.1. Suppose G is a reductive group in Harish-Chandra’s class.
The Hermitian dual of G is the set Πh (G) of equivalence classes of irreducible
                 CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                     1091

(g, K) modules endowed with nondegenerate invariant Hermitian forms. Here
K is a maximal compact subgroup of G; and an equivalence is required to
preserve the Hermitian form.
     Suppose λu ∈ Λu (cf. (0.5)). The set of Hermitian representations of G
attached to λu is
          Πλhu (G) = {π ∈ Πh (G) | π has a lowest K-type in Buλu (G)}
(cf. Definition 0.2).

    Proposition 0.3 immediately shows that these sets partition the Hermitian
dual:

    Proposition 5.2.       Suppose λu and λ′u belong to Λu (cf. (0.5)). If λu
                                                           λ′
and λ′u belong to the same orbit of R(G), then Πλhu (G) = Πhu (G). If not, then
               λ′
Πλhu (G) and Πhu (G) are disjoint.

    At this point it is useful to be a little more precise than we have been
about the notion of signature.

     Definition 5.3. (See [17, Def. 1.4], or [9, Prop. 6.12].) Suppose X is an
admissible representation of K (that is, locally finite with finite multiplicities),
and h , i is a K-invariant Hermitian form on X. The signature of h , i is a set of
                               b to the nonnegative integers, defined as follows.
three functions (p, q, z) from K
Suppose (δ, Vδ ) is an irreducible representation of K. Fix a positive-definite
invariant Hermitian form h , iδ on Vδ . Define
                              X δ = HomK (Vδ , X).
This is a finite-dimensional vector space, of dimension equal to the multiplicity
m(δ) of δ in X. There is a unique Hermitian form h , iδ on X δ characterized
by the property
             hT v, Swi = hT, Siδ hv, wiδ     (T, S ∈ X δ , v, w ∈ Vδ ).
The form h , iδ may be diagonalized; and we define p(δ) (respectively q(δ), z(δ))
to be the number of positive (respectively negative, zero) diagonal entries.
These numbers are of course independent of the choice of diagonalization, and
characterize the form h , iδ up to equivalence. Notice that
                           m(δ) = p(δ) + q(δ) + z(δ).
The form h , i on X is nondegenerate if and only if z = 0, and positive definite
if and only if q = z = 0.

     Theorem 5.4.       Suppose λu ∈ Λu (cf. (0.5)).
 a) The functor LK                                   λu               λu
                 Su (λu ) provides a bijection from Bu (G(λu )) onto Bu (G).
1092           SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


 b) The set Πλhu (G(λu )) consists of all irreducible (g(λu ), G(λu ) ∩ K)-modules
    endowed with an invariant Hermitian form, and containing at least one
    (G(λu ) ∩ K)-type in the set Buλu (G(λu )).
 c) There is a natural bijection
                               Πλhu (G(λ)) → Πλhu (G)
    defined as follows. Suppose that Z ∈ Πλhu (G(λu )) is irreducible as a
    (g(λu ), G(λu ) ∩ K)-module. Then the corresponding (g, K)-module X is
    the unique irreducible subquotient of LSu (λu )(Z) containing K-types in
    Baλa (G). The Hermitian form on X is the one inherited from the one on
    LSu (λu )(Z) induced from Z by Proposition 2.10.
 d) The bijections of (a) and (c) preserve signatures of Hermitian forms; that
    is, the signature on a K type in Buλu (G) of the Hermitian form on X is
    equal to the signature on the corresponding G(λu ) ∩ K-type of the Hermi-
    tian form on Z.
 e) Suppose Z ∈ Πλhu (G(λ)) is an irreducible (g(λu ), G(λ) ∩ K)-module, and
    the infinitesimal character of Z corresponds by the Harish-Chandra iso-
    morphism to a weight φ ∈ h∗ . Assume that
                  Re hφ + ρ(u(λu )), αi ≥ 0              (α ∈ ∆(u(λu ), h).
       Then LSu (λu )(Z) is irreducible.

       Proof. Part (a) is Proposition 3.1(c). For (b), the group G plays no role,
so we may as well assume G = G(λu ). One inclusion is obvious; so suppose X is
an irreducible (g, K)-module containing a K-type δ ∈ Buλu (G). We must show
that the lowest K-type δ′ also belongs to Buλu (G). Write Z for the identity
component of the compact part of the center of G. Then tc is the orthogonal
direct sum of z and the span of the roots. Since G(λu ) = G, the weight λu is
orthogonal to all the roots; so λu ∈ iz∗0 is just the differential of the character
by which Z acts on δ. Since Z acts by the same character on δ′ , we see that
λ′u |z = λu . This implies that

(5.1)                                  |λu | ≤ |λ′u |.

Now we apply

     Lemma 5.5. Suppose X is an irreducible (g, K)-module of lowest K-type
      λ′
δ′ ∈ Bu u (G), and δ is any other K-type of X. Then δ has a highest weight µ
with
                               λu (µ) = λ′u + Q′ ,
with Q′ a sum with nonnegative coefficients of roots of tc in q(λ′u ). In particular,
                         hλu (µ), λu (µ)i ≥ hλ′u , λ′u i,
with equality only if λu (µ) = λ′u .
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                      1093

      We will give the proof in a moment. Assuming the result, we find that
|λu | ≥ |λ′u |. By 5.1, equality must hold. The condition for equality in the
Lemma is λ′u = λu ; so the lowest K-type δ′ of X belongs to Buλu (G), as we
wished to show.
      Part (c) is (in light of (3.1)) just Theorem 2.13(b); part (d) is Theorem
2.13(d); and part (e) is Theorem 2.13(e).

     Proof of Lemma 5.5. This is a variation on Lemma 6.5.6 in [16], which we
will also use here. Fix a highest weight µ′ of δ′ so that λu (µ′ ) = λ′u , and define
λ′a = λa (µ′ ). According to the proofs of Lemma 6.5.6 and Theorem 6.5.9 in
[16] we can find a highest weight µ of δ so that
(5.2a)                            λa (µ) = λ′a + Q′1 ,
with Q′ a sum with nonnegative coefficients of roots of tc in q(λ′u ). We want
a relationship between λu (µ) and λ′u , so we rewrite both sides in those terms.
Fix a positive root system (∆+ )′ making λ′a dominant, and write ρ′ for half
the sum of its positive roots. Then 5.2(a) becomes
(5.2b)                  λu (µ) + ρ0 = λ′u + Q′1 + ρ′ − w′ .
Here w′ is a nonnegative combination of roots in (∆+ )′ orthogonal to λ′u . On
the left we have used instead Corollary 1.9: ρ0 is a dominant weight in the
convex hull of the W0 -orbit of ρ. By Proposition 1.10, we can write
                                X
(5.2c)             ρ0 = ρ′ −         bα′ α′   (0 ≤ bα′ ≤ 1).
                              α′ ∈(∆+ )′

Inserting this in (5.2b) gives
                                                    X
(5.2d)               λu (µ) = λ′u + Q′1 − w′ +                 bα′ α′ .
                                                  α′ ∈(∆+ )′

This has the form required in the lemma. The last inequality is an immediate
consequence.

     We need one more definition.

     Definition 5.6 (16, Def. 5.4.11]). Suppose h0 is a θ-stable Cartan subal-
gebra of g0 . Write h0 = t0 + a0 for its decomposition into the +1 and −1
eigenspaces of θ: t0 = h0 ∩ k0 , and a0 = h0 ∩ p0 . Any complex-valued linear
functional γ ∈ h∗ may then be written as
                                 γ = (λ, ν) ∈ t∗ + a∗ .
Now make a further decomposition of γ as
                       γ = γ1 + iγ2 = (λ1 , ν1 ) + i(λ2 , ν2 ),
1094         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


in such a way that γj takes purely real values on a0 , and purely imaginary
values on t0 . That is,
                    λj ∈ it∗0 ,       νj ∈ a∗0 ,      γj ∈ it∗0 + a∗0 .
Define the canonical real and imaginary parts of γ as
                            RE γ = γ1 ,            IM γ = γ2 .
If α ∈ h∗ is a root, then
                                  Re hγ, αi = hRE γ, αi,
and similarly for imaginary parts.
     One checks easily that the decomposition into canonical real and imag-
inary parts commutes with the action of the Weyl group, and in fact with
any automorphism that is inner for the complexified Lie algebra ([16, Lemma
5.4.12]).
     Here is the main conjecture of this paper.
     Conjecture 5.7. Suppose λu ∈ Λu (cf. (0.5)), and that G(λu ) = G. Sup-
pose X ∈ Πλhu (G) is an irreducible Hermitian (g, K)-module (Definition 5.1).
Let h be a θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of g0 , and φ ∈ h∗ a weight parametrizing
the infinitesimal character of X by the Harish-Chandra isomorphism. Assume
that the canonical real part RE φ does not belong to λu plus the convex hull
of the Weyl group orbit of ρ. Then the signature of the Hermitian form on X
must be indefinite on K-types in Buλu (G).
     The statement of this conjecture is complicated somewhat by the central
weight λu . Of course the center of g is more or less irrelevant to interesting
statements about unitary representations. In particular, Conjecture 5.7 is
equivalent to the following statement about semisimple groups. (This kind of
reduction is discussed again in 6.1 below.)
    Conjecture 5.7′ . Suppose G is a connected semisimple group in Harish-
Chandra’s class; and suppose X ∈ Π0h (G) is an irreducible Hermitian (g, K)-
module (Definition 5.1). Let h be a θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of g0 , and
φ ∈ h∗ a weight parametrizing the infinitesimal character of X by the Harish-
Chandra isomorphism. Assume that the canonical real part RE φ does not
belong to the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of ρ. Then the signature of
the Hermitian form on X must be indefinite on K-types in Bu0 (G).
     We will give some supporting evidence for this conjecture in Proposition
7.12 below, which is based on Parthasarathy’s Dirac operator inequality. We
also formulate a conjectural sharpening of the Dirac operator inequality which
would imply Conjecture 5.7′ (Conjecture 7.19).
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                     1095

     Theorem 5.8.       In the setting of Theorem 5.4, assume that Conjecture
5.7 is true for G(λu ). Then the bijection of (c) preserves unitarity. More
precisely, suppose h0 is a θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of g(λu )0 . Write W0 for
the Weyl group of h in g(λu ).
 a) The cohomological parabolic induction functor LSu (λu ) implements a bi-
    jection from Πλuu (G(λu )) onto Πλuu (G).
 b) Assume that Z is an irreducible unitary (g(λu ), G(λ)∩K)-module contain-
    ing a (G(λu ) ∩ K)-type in Buλu (G(λu )), and that the infinitesimal char-
    acter of Z corresponds by the Harish-Chandra isomorphism to a weight
    φ(Z) ∈ h∗ . Then RE φ(Z) − λu (cf. Definition 5.6) belongs to the convex
    hull of the W0 orbit of ρ(g(λu )).
 c) Assume that X ∈ Πλuu (G), and that the infinitesimal character of X cor-
    responds by the Harish-Chandra isomorphism to a weight φ(X) ∈ h∗ .
    Assume that RE φ(X) is dominant for the roots of h in u(λu ). Then
    RE φ(X) − (λu + ρ(u(λu ))) belongs to the convex hull of the W0 orbit of
    ρ(g(λu )). In particular, Tρ (RE φ(X)) = λu .

     The last statement of (c) appears to recover λu from the infinitesimal
character of any representation in Πλuu (G). It does not quite do that, however,
since we needed the weight φ(X) to satisfy a positivity condition determined
by λu . At any rate we can recover the Weyl group orbit of λu .
     Before embarking on the proof of this result, we need a complement to
Conjecture 5.7.

     Theorem 5.9.         Suppose λu ∈ Λu (cf. (0.5)), and that G(λu ) = G.
                  λu
Suppose X ∈ Πh (G) is an irreducible Hermitian (g, K)-module. Let h be
a θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of g0 , and φ ∈ h∗ a weight parametrizing the
infinitesimal character of X by the Harish-Chandra isomorphism. Assume
that the canonical real part RE φ belongs to λu plus the convex hull of the Weyl
group orbit of ρ. Then X is unitary if and only if its Hermitian form is positive
definite on K-types in Buλu (G).

        Proof. There is no loss of generality in assuming that h is the fundamental
Cartan subalgebra. We use Theorem 1.5 of [17]. That provides irreducible tem-
pered (g, K)-modules Z1 , . . . , Zp (of real infinitesimal character) and integers
r1± , . . . , rp± , so that the signature of the Hermitian form on X is
                               X                 X             
                                    ri+ ΘK (Zi ),   ri− ΘK (Zi ) .

Here ΘK (Z) denotes the formal K-character of Z. Fix a lowest K-type δi of
Zi , and a highest weight µi of δi . Write λi = λa (µi ).
      Because Zi is tempered and has real infinitesimal character, Theorem 4.3
shows that the infinitesimal character is given by the weight λi . The proof
1096         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


of Theorem 1.5 in [17] shows first of all that each Zi has the same central
character as X; and second, that the infinitesimal character λi must belong
to the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of RE φ. From these two facts we
deduce that λi must belong to λu plus the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit
of ρ. Corollary 1.9 therefore implies that (in the notation of Proposition 1.4)
Tρ (λi ) = λu . By Corollary 1.6, it follows that λu (µi ) = λu , and therefore that
δi ∈ Buλu (G).
     For the proof of the theorem, “only if” is clear; so suppose X is not
                                      P −
positive definite. This means that       ri ΘK (Zi ) 6= 0. It follows that the lowest
K-types of one of the Zi must appear with nonzero multiplicity in this sum;
that is, that the form on X is not positive on some δi . (For this it is enough to
take |λi | minimal with ri− 6= 0. The absence of cancellation then follows from
Theorem 6.5.9(b) in [16].) But we have just seen that δi belongs to Buλu (G),
as we wished to show.

     Proof of Theorem 5.8. Part (b) is an immediate consequence of Conjecture
5.7. For (a), suppose X ∈ Πλuu (G); write Z for the corresponding Hermitian
representation in Πλhu (G(λu )) (Theorem 5.4(c)). By Theorem 5.4(d), the Her-
mitian form on Z must be positive on the (G(λu ) ∩ K)-types in Buλu (G(λu )).
By Conjecture 5.7, the infinitesimal character of Z corresponds to a weight
φ(Z) ∈ h∗ with
(5.3a)                         RE φ(Z) = λu + w0 .
Here w0 is a weight in the convex hull of the W0 orbit of ρ(g(λu )). By Theorem
5.9, Z is unitary. Adding ρ(u(λu )) to (5.3a) gives
(5.3b)             RE φ(Z) + ρ(u(λu )) = λu + ρ(u(λu )) + w0 .
The right side here is strictly dominant on roots of h in u(λu ) (compare the ar-
gument at the end of the proof of Lemma 3.2). By Theorem 5.4(e), LSu (λu )(Z)
is irreducible. For the converse, suppose Z ∈ Πλuu (G(λu )). By Conjecture 5.7,
the infinitesimal character of Z satisfies (5.3a). We have seen that this implies
the positivity condition in Theorem 2.13(e); so by Theorem 2.13(e) and (f),
LSu (λu )(Z) is irreducible and unitary, as we wished to show.
      For (c), we may assume by (a) that X = LSu (λu )(Z), and that the in-
finitesimal character of Z corresponds to a weight φ(Z) satisfying (5.3a). Using
Corollary 5.25 of [9] (or Prop. 6.3.11 of [16]) we find that the infinitesimal char-
acter of X is represented by the weight
(5.3c)                      φ(X) = φ(Z) + ρ(u(λu )).
We have seen above that RE φ(X) is strictly dominant for the roots of h in
u(λu ); so this φ(X) must coincide (up to the action of W0 ) with the represen-
tative chosen in (c). Now (5.3c) and (5.3b) together imply that φ(X) has the
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                    1097

property asserted in (c). This in turn implies that Tρ (RE φ(X)) = λu by (for
example) Corollary 1.9.

    Corollary 5.10.        Conjecture 5.7 (for the subgroup G(λu ) of G) implies
Conjecture 0.6.



               6. The set Buz (G) of unitarily small K-types

     Definition 6.1. Suppose G is a real reductive group in Harish-Chandra’s
class, and K is a maximal compact subgroup. A parameter λu ∈ Λu (cf. (0.5))
is called unitarily small if G(λu ) = G (cf. (0.6)). The set of unitarily small
parameters is written Λzu (G); the z stands for central. A highest weight µ ∈ Tbc
                                                                             b is
is called unitarily small if λu (µ) is unitarily small. A representation δ ∈ K
called unitarily small (with respect to G) if δ has a unitarily small highest
weight. The set of all unitarily small K-types is written Buz (G).

     This is the analogue of “small” ([16, Def. 5.3.24], or [15, Def. 5.1]); the
change is that the weight λa (µ) constructed in Proposition 2.3 has been re-
placed by λu (µ). Because of (3.1d), unitarily small is a weaker condition than
small. It is fairly easy to see from the definition and Proposition 1.1 that the
trivial representation of K is always unitarily small. By contrast, the trivial
representation is small in the sense of [16] if and only if G is quasisplit.
     Theorem 5.8 reduces the classification of unitary representations (at least
modulo Conjecture 5.7) to the classification of sets Πλuu (G), with λu unitarily
small. By Theorem 5.4(b), membership in such a set is equivalent to containing
a K-type in Buλu (G). So Conjecture 5.7 reduces the classification of unitary rep-
resentations to the classification of those containing a unitarily small K-type.
That is one reason to understand such K-types as completely as possible. A
second reason is that Conjecture 5.7 is again a statement about representations
containing unitarily small K-types.
     For these reasons, we devote the next two sections to a series of character-
izations of unitarily small K-types (Theorem 6.7, Corollary 6.12, Proposition
7.1, and Proposition 7.17). We begin with some examples of the calculation in
(0.5).

      Example 6.2.   Suppose G = SL(2, R), and K = SO(2) = T c , so that

(a)                         b = Tbc ≃ Z ⊂ R ≃ i(tc0 )∗ .
                            K

The set of roots of T c in g is

(b)                               ∆(g, tc ) = {±2};

both of these are noncompact imaginary. Write µn for the irreducible repre-
sentation of K corresponding to the integer n. Because there are no compact
roots, 2ρc = 0. Therefore µn + 2ρc = µn is dominant for the positive root
system
(c)                          ∆+ (g, tc ) = {(sgn n) · 2};
here we define sgn 0 = +1. The corresponding positive Weyl chamber C con-
sists of the half line containing sgn n. The projection P on C is the identity
on C, and sends the other half line to zero. Now 2ρ = 2 sgn n, so
(d)                        µn + 2ρc − 2ρ = n − 2 sgn n.
This belongs to C (and so is equal to λu (µn )) as long as |n| ≥ 2. For smaller
values of n it does not belong to C, so the projection on C is zero. To sum-
marize:
                                
                                  n − 2 sgn n, if |n| ≥ 2;
(e)                  λu (µn ) =
                                  0,            if |n| ≤ 2.
This verifies the assertions made in the introduction after (0.1). In particular,
we see that the set of unitarily small K-types (or highest weights) is
(f)                       Buz (SL(2, R)) = {µn | |n| ≤ 2}.
By contrast, the set of small K-types in the sense of [16] consists of the µn
with |n| ≤ 1.
    Example 6.3. Suppose G = Sp(4, R), the real symplectic group of rank
2. Then K = U(2) (the rank two unitary group), so T = U(1) × U(1), and
(a)                      Tbc ≃ Z2 ⊂ R2 ≃ i(tc0 )∗ .
The set of roots of T c in g is
(b)              ∆(g, tc ) = {(±2, 0), (0, ±2), ±(1, 1), ±(1, −1)};
all but the last pair are noncompact. As a positive root in K we choose
(1, −1) = 2ρc ; the dominant weights µ(p,q) are then parametrized by decreasing
pairs of integers (p, q). We write δ(p,q) for the irreducible representation of U(2)
of highest weight µ(p,q) . Calculation of λu (µ(p,q) ) falls into four cases according
to the positive root system defined by µ(p,q) + 2ρc . We look at just one of these
cases carefully. Suppose that
(c)
p + 1 ≥ 1 − q ≥ 0, ∆+ (g, tc ) = {(2, 0), (0, −2), (1, 1), (1, −1)}, 2ρ = (4, −2).
Then one can calculate
                     
                      (p − 3, q + 1),         if   p − 3 ≥ −1 − q ≥ 0;
                     
                      (p − 3, 0),             if   p − 3 ≥ 0 and −1 − q ≤ 0;
(d)   λu (µ(p,q) ) =
                     
                      ( p−q−4
                           2   , −(p−q−4)
                                    2     ),   if   p − q ≥ 4 and p − 3 ≤ −1 − q;
                     
                       (0, 0)                  if   p − 3 ≤ 0 and p − q ≤ 4.
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                     1099

Combining this information with similar calculations in the other three cases,
we find
(e)           Buz (Sp(4, R)) = {δ(p,q) | 3 ≥ p ≥ q ≥ −3, p − q ≤ 4}.
There are 25 representations of K in this set. The set of small representations
of K consists of just five of them:
(f)                   {δ(p,q) | 1 ≥ p ≥ q ≥ −1, p − q ≤ 1}.

     Example 6.4. In order to understand the role of the compact part of
the center of G, we include one example where that is nontrivial. So let G =
U(1, 1), the unitary group of the standard indefinite Hermitian form on C2 .
We can take K = T c = U(1) × U(1), and
(a)                          Tbc ≃ Z2 ⊂ R2 ≃ i(tc0 )∗ .
The set of roots of T c in g is
(b)                           ∆(g, tc ) = {±(1, −1)};
these roots are noncompact. Of course this example is very close to Example
6.2, and we use parallel notation. A calculation like the one given there shows
that
                         
                           (p, q) − (sgn (p − q))(1, −1), if |p − q| ≥ 2;
(c)       λu (µ(p,q) ) =
                           ((p + q)/2, (p + q)/2),        if |p − q| ≤ 2.
The set of unitarily small parameters is therefore
(d)                   Λzu (U(1, 1)) = {(m/2, m/2) | m ∈ Z}.
Notice that these weights are precisely the restrictions to the center of arbitrary
weights in Tbc . The unitarily small K-types are
(e)                    Buz (U(1, 1)) = {δ(p,q) | |p − q| ≤ 2}.

     With these examples in hand, we turn to a general description of unitarily
small K-types. In addition to the notation from the introduction, we need to
introduce
(6.1a)            Z = identity component of the center of G.
This group is preserved by θ, and so has a direct product decomposition
(6.1b)          Z = Zc Zh         (Zc = Z ∩ K, Zh = exp(z0 ∩ p0 ).
(The subscript h stands for “hyperbolic.”) Write
(6.1c)            Gs = derived group of G0 ,       Ts = Gs ∩ T c .
1100                SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


On the Lie algebra level we have direct sum decompositions
(6.1d)                          g0 = gs,0 + z0 ,       tc0 = ts,0 + zc,0 .
(The subspaces ts,0 and zc,0 correspond to what was called Vs and Vz in (1.2).)
On the group level the corresponding decompositions are not direct: Z ∩Gs can
be nontrivial. (Because we have taken Gs to be connected, the multiplication
map from Gs × Z to G is never surjective unless G is connected. In fact this
problem persists even if we replace Gs by the full derived group of G.)
     We propose to use the decompositions in (6.1) to reduce many problems to
the semisimple case. There is a technical complication, however: the subgroup
Gs need not be closed in G. It is preserved by the Cartan involution, and has
a well-behaved Cartan decomposition
                                Gs = (Gs ∩ K) · exp(gs,0 ∩ p0 );
but the (connected reductive) group Gs ∩ K need not be compact. When
this happens, Gs is not in Harish-Chandra’s class. Nevertheless all the results
we have proved apply to it, after minor adjustments in the formulations. (For
example, one considers only unitary representations of Gs ∩K, and only unitary
characters of Ts .) Alternatively, one can strengthen the hypotheses on G to
exclude the problem. For example, one can assume that G is a finite cover
of a real reductive algebraic group. This assumption is inherited by Gs . We
will therefore ignore the problem, and speak as if Gs were again in Harish-
Chandra’s class.
    Lemma 6.5.     With notation as above, suppose µ ∈ Tbc is a K-dominant
weight. Write µz and µs for its restrictions to Zc and Ts . Then
                        λu (G)(µ) = λu (Gs )(µs ) + µz ∈ it∗s,0 + iz∗c,0 .
In particular, µ is unitarily small for G if and only if µs is unitarily small for
Gs .

    This is obvious from the definitions. In the same way we can reduce
matters to the various simple factors of Gs .
       Lemma 6.6.   With notation as above, list the simple factors of Gs as
G1s , . . . Grs . i
           Put Ts = Ts ∩ Gis , so that there is a direct sum decomposition
                                     t∗s = (t1s )∗ + · · · + (trs )∗ .
Suppose µs ∈ Tbs is a (Gs ∩ K)-dominant weight. Write µis for its restriction
to Tsi . Then
                       λu (Gs )(µs ) = λu (G1s )(µ1s ) + · · · + λu (Grs )(µrs ).
In particular, µs is unitarily small if and only if all the µis are.

    Again we omit the simple proof.
    Here is the main result of this section.

     Theorem 6.7.        Use the notation of Definition 6.1 and (6.1). Suppose
δ ∈ K has highest weight µ ∈ Tbc . Write µz ∈ iz∗c,0 for the differential of the
     b
restriction of µ to Zc . Define λu (µ) and λa (µ) as in (0.5) and Proposition 2.3.
Then the following conditions are equivalent.
 a) The K-type δ is unitarily small (Definition 6.1).
 b) The parameter λu (µ) is equal to µz .
 c) The parameter λa (µ) belongs to µz plus the convex hull of the Weyl group
    orbit of ρ.
 d) Let ∆+ (g, tc ) be a positive root system making µ + 2ρc dominant. List the
    fundamamental weights for ∆+ as {ξ1 , . . . , ξl } (cf. (1.2). Write 2ρn for
    the sum of the noncompact positive roots. Then
                           hξi , µi ≤ hξi , 2ρn i       (1 ≤ i ≤ l).
 e) Let (∆+ )′ (g, tc ) be any positive root system containing ∆+ (k, tc ). List the
    fundamamental weights for (∆+ )′ as {ξ1′ , . . . , ξl′ } (cf. (1.2)). Write 2ρ′n for
    the sum of the noncompact positive roots. Then
                           hξi′ , µi ≤ hξi′ , 2ρ′n i    (1 ≤ i ≤ l).
 f) There is a system of positive roots (∆+ )′ (g, tc ) containing ∆+ (k, tc ), with
    the property that
                                 X
                    µ = µz +             cβ β       (0 ≤ cβ ≤ 1).
                                  β∈(∆+ )′ (p,tc )

 g) There is an expression
                                       X
                       µ = µz +                  bβ β    (0 ≤ bβ ≤ 1).
                                    β∈∆(p,tc )


      Proof. The equivalence of (a) and (b) is clear from Lemma 6.5 and the
definitions. For the equivalence of (b) and (c), recall from (3.1c) that λu (µ) =
Tρ ((λa )(µ)). Now the equivalence is clear from Proposition 1.7.
      For the rest, the conditions in (d) through (g) are clearly satisfied if and
only if the analogous conditions on µs are satisfied. Lemma 6.5 therefore
allows us to assume that G = Gs is connected and semisimple. Under this
assumption, we will prove that (a) implies (d); that (d) implies (e); that (e)
implies (f); that (f) implies (g); and finally that (g) implies (a). The most
difficult of these is (e) implies (f).
      So suppose that G is semisimple and that µ is unitarily small; that is, that
λu (µ) = 0. According to (0.5) and Proposition 1.7, this means that µ+2ρc −2ρ
1102         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


belongs to −C o . Since the fundamental weights ξi belong to the positive Weyl
chamber C, it follows that
                                 hξi , µ + 2ρc − 2ρi ≤ 0.
Because 2ρ = 2ρc + 2ρn , this is equivalent to
                                    hξi , µi ≤ hξi , 2ρn i.
This is (d).
    Next, suppose that (d) holds. Fix (∆+ )′ as in (e); say
(6.2a)                                (∆+ )′ = w∆+ ,
for some w in the Weyl group. We may assume that the fundamental roots
are labelled in such a way that ξi′ = wξi . Then
(6.2b)      hξi′ , µi = hξi′ , µ + 2ρc i − hξi′ , 2ρc i = hwξi′ , µ + 2ρc i − hξi′ , 2ρc i.
By Lemma 1.8,
(6.2c)                      hwξi , µ + 2ρc i ≤ hξi , µ + 2ρc i.
By our hypothesis (d), it follows that
(6.2d)         hwξi , µ + 2ρc i ≤ hξi , 2ρi = hwξi , 2wρi = hξi′ , 2ρ′ i.
Inserting the inequality (6.2d) in (6.2b) yields
(6.2e)               hξi′ , µi ≤ hξi′ , 2ρ′ i − hξi′ , 2ρc i = hξi′ , 2ρ′n i.
This is (e).
    Because the proof that (e) implies (f) is the most difficult part of the
argument, we postpone it to the end. That (f) implies (g) is trivial. Assume
therefore that (g) holds (still assuming G is semisimple); we will deduce (a).
Choose a positive system ∆+ making µ + 2ρc dominant. The formula for µ
may then be written as
                                   X
                          µ=            (bβ − b−β )β.
                                    β∈∆+ (p,tc )

Here the coefficients cβ = bβ − b−β lie between −1 and 1. We may therefore
write                                 X
                         µ = 2ρn +          (cβ − 1)β;
                                          β∈∆+ (p,tc )

the coefficients aβ = cβ − 1 in this formula lie between 0 and −2. It follows
that                             X
                µ + 2ρc − 2ρ =          aβ β     (−2 ≤ aβ ≤ 0).
                                     β∈∆+ (p,t)
               CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                   1103

Obviously the right side belongs to −C o , the cone spanned by negative roots.
By Proposition 1.7, P (µ + 2ρc − 2ρ) = 0; that is, λu (µ) = 0. This is (a).
     Finally, we turn to the proof that (e) implies (f). We proceed by induction
on the dimension of G. Recall that we are assuming that G = Gs is semisimple.
Lemma 6.6 actually allows us to assume that G is simple. (More precisely, if g0
has a nontrivial decomposition into simple factors, then the summands have
lower dimension, so we already know the implication for them. Lemma 6.6
allows us to deduce the implication for G.)

     Lemma 6.8. Suppose G is compact and simple. Then the only weight µ
satisfying either condition (e) or condition (f) of Theorem 6.7 is µ = 0.

    Proof. The condition in (e) is
                                   hξ, µi ≤ 0
for any fundamental weight ξ (with respect to the fixed positive system making
µ dominant). Because fundamental weights have nonnegative inner product,
this implies µ = 0. The argument for (f) is even simpler.

    We may therefore assume that G is noncompact and simple.

     Lemma 6.9.        Suppose G is noncompact and simple. Then the noncom-
pact roots span (tc )∗ . In particular, in the setting of Theorem 6.7(e),
                                 hξi′ , 2ρ′n i > 0.

    Proof. Define
(6.3a)          ∆0 = {α ∈ ∆(g, tc ) | hα, βi = 0 (β ∈ ∆(p, t))},

(6.3b)            ∆1 = roots in the integer span of ∆(p, tc ).
Obviously ∆0 and ∆1 are mutually orthogonal root subsystems in ∆. We claim
that
(6.3c)                          ∆ = ∆0 ∪ ∆1 .
Assume this for a moment. The orthogonality of the decomposition allows us
to conclude that root vectors for ∆0 and ∆1 must commute with each other,
and therefore that we get a corresponding decomposition
(6.3d)                           g0 = g00 + g10 .
Because g0 is simple, this decomposition must be trivial. Since G is assumed
to be noncompact, the second factor is nontrivial; so the first must be trivial.
Therefore ∆ = ∆1 , which is the first claim in the lemma.
1104            SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


    To prove (6.3c), suppose γ is any root belonging neither to ∆0 nor to ∆1 .
Since ∆1 includes the noncompact roots, γ must be compact. Since it is not
in ∆0 , there is a noncompact root β with which it has nonzero inner product.
Possibly replacing β by −β, we get
                                         hγ, βi < 0.
It follows (by the representation theory of the SU(2) generated by γ) that β +γ
is a noncompact root. Therefore γ = (β +γ)−β belongs to ∆1 , a contradiction.
      To prove the last inequality, notice that ξi′ has nonnegative inner product
with each positive root. Therefore
(6.3e)
     ∆+ (p, tc ) = {β ∈ ∆(p, t) | hξi′ , βi > 0} ∪ {certain roots orthogonal to ξi′ }.
So
                                                 X
(6.3f)                        hξi′ , 2ρn i =                hξi′ , βi.
                                               β∈∆(p,tc )
                                               hξi′ ,βi>0

This is a sum of strictly positive terms; and it is nonempty by the first part of
the lemma.
     We continue now with the proof that (e) implies (f) in Theorem 6.7.
Recall that we are proceeding by induction on the dimension of G, and that
we have reduced to the case when G is simple and noncompact. We propose
to apply the inductive hypothesis to a maximal Levi subgroup of G. In order
to construct it, we choose a positive root system (∆+ )′ (g, tc ) ⊃ ∆+ (k, tc ) and
a fundamental weight ξi′ so as to maximize the quotient
(6.4a)                            ci = hξi′ , µi/hξi′ , 2ρ′n i.
Notice that the denominator is strictly positive by Lemma 6.9. We can make
the numerator nonnegative by an appropriate choice of (∆+ )′ (for example by
making µ dominant); so our maximum ci must be nonnegative. By hypothesis
(e) of Theorem 6.7, ci is bounded above by 1. Consequently
(6.4b)                                  0 ≤ ci ≤ 1.
The weight ξi′ belongs to i(tc0 )∗ , so by (0.6) it defines a proper Levi subgroup
(6.4c)                              Li = G(ξi′ ) ⊃ T c .
The root system of Li is
(6.4d)           ∆i = {γ ∈ ∆ | hξi′ , γi = 0} = span of {α′j | j 6= i}.
Our choice of positive roots for K gives a positive system
(6.4e)                      ∆+           c          +     c
                             i (li ∩ k, t ) = ∆i ∩ ∆ (k, t ).

The construction of (0.6) also provides a unipotent subalgebra
(6.4f)          ui = u(ξi′ ),       ∆(ui , t) = {γ ∈ ∆ | hξi′ , γi > 0}.
Recall from (0.4d) that 2ρ(ui ∩ p) denotes the sum of the roots of tc in ui ∩ p;
that is, the sum of the noncompact roots having positive inner product with
ξi′ . Define
(6.4g)                           µi = µ − 2ci ρ(ui ∩ p).


    Lemma 6.10.       Use the notation of (6.4).
 a) The weight µi belongs to the R-span of the roots of Li .
 b) The weight µi is dominant integral for Li ∩ K. More precisely, if α is any
    root in Li ∩ K, then
                                 hα, µi i = hα, µi.
 c) The weight µi satisfies condition (e) of Theorem 6.7 with respect to the
    group Li .

     Let us assume this lemma for a moment, and complete our proof that (e)
implies (f). Because Li has strictly lower dimension than G, we may assume by
inductive hypothesis that (e) implies (f) for Li . Parts (a) and (b) of Lemma
6.10 guarantee that Theorem 6.7 makes sense for Li and µi ; and part (c)
says that Theorem 6.7(e) is satisfied. By induction, Theorem 6.7(f) must be
satisfied as well. That is, we can find a positive system (∆+   ′′
                                                             i ) for Li , containing
  +          c
∆i (li ∩ k, t ), so that
                                X
(6.5a)                µi =                cβ β     (0 ≤ cβ ≤ 1).
                          β∈(∆+
                              i
                                )′′ (li ∩p,tc )

Now define a positive root system for G by
(6.5b)                        (∆+ )′′ = (∆+  ′′         c
                                          i ) ∪ ∆(ui , t ).

Then (6.4g) and (6.5a) show that
(6.5c)      µ = 2ci ρ(ui ∩ p) + µi
                   X                        X
              =           ci β +                         cβ β     (0 ≤ cβ ≤ 1).
                 β∈∆(ui ∩p)         β∈(∆+           c
                                        i ) (li ∩p,t )
                                           ′′


Because of (6.4b), this expression has the form required in Theorem 6.7(f).
     It remains to prove Lemma 6.10. For (a), (1.2) shows that the R-span of
the roots of Li is precisely the orthogonal complement of ξi′ . We calculate
                       hξi′ , µi i = hξi′ , µi − ci hξi′ , 2ρ(ui ∩ p)i.
1106          SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


Using (6.3f), we see that the second inner product on the right is just hξi′ , 2ρ′n i.
Therefore
                         hξi′ , µi i = hξi′ , µi − ci hξi′ , 2ρ′n i.
Inserting the definition (6.4a) of ci , we see immediately that the right side is
zero, as desired.
     For (b), it is enough to prove the formula. In light of (6.4g), the formula
amounts to
                     hα, 2ρ(ui ∩ p)i = 0    (α ∈ ∆(li ∩ k, tc )).
Because the adjoint action of the reductive group Li ∩ K preserves ui ∩ p, the
sum of the weights of the latter must be orthogonal to the roots of Li ∩ K.
     We turn now to (c). Suppose therefore that (∆+        ′′
                                                        i ) is a system of positive
                         +           c
roots for Li containing ∆i (li ∩ k, t ). Just as in (6.5) we define a positive root
system for G by
(6.6a)                      (∆+ )′′ = (∆+  ′′         c
                                        i ) ∪ ∆(ui , t ).

Write
(6.6b)                             Π′′ = {α′′1 , . . . , α′′l }
for the set of simple roots, and {ξj′′ } for the dual basis of fundamental weights.
By construction, the two positive root systems (∆+ )′ and (∆+ )′′ differ by an
element of the Weyl group of ∆i . It follows that
(6.6c)                                     ξi′ = ξi′′ .
Furthermore the constants ci defined using (∆+ )′ and (∆+ )′′ coincide, as do
the weights 2ρ(ui ∩ p). Consequently there is no loss of generality in assuming
henceforth that (∆+ )′ = (∆+ )′′ .
    We are trying to establish an inequality relating µi and the fundamental
weights for the positive system (∆+   ′                 i ′
                                   i ) . Let us write (ξj ) for these fundamental
weights. According to (1.2), they are characterized by belonging to the span
of ∆i , and by
(6.7a)                    h(ξji )′ , α′k i = δjk          (k, j 6= i).
From these requirements we see that (ξji )′ must be the projection of ξj′ orthog-
onal to ξi′ . That is,
(6.7b)                    (ξji )′ = ξj′ − (hξi′ , ξj′ i/hξi′ , ξi′ i)ξi′ .
The sum of the noncompact positive roots for Li is
(6.7c)                       2(ρin )′ = 2ρ′n − 2ρ(ui ∩ p).
The inequality of Theorem 6.7(e) that we are trying to prove is
(6.7d)                       h(ξji )′ , µi i ≤ h(ξji )′ , 2(ρin )′ i.
                  CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                             1107

We begin by examining the right side. Because 2(ρin )′ is a sum of roots in Li ,
it is orthogonal to ξi′ . So (6.7b) allows us to replace (ξji )′ by ξj′ on the right
side. Inserting (6.7c) gives
(6.7e)                  h(ξji )′ , 2(ρin )′ i = hξj′ , 2ρ′n − 2ρ(ui ∩ p)i.
Next we examine the left side of (6.7d). By construction µi is orthogonal to
ξi′ , so (6.7b) allows us to replace (ξji )′ by ξj′ here as well. Just as in (6.4a), let
us define
(6.7f)                             cj = hξj′ , µi/hξj′ , 2ρ′n i.
Using this definition and (6.4g), we get
(6.7g)               h(ξji )′ , µi i = hξj′ , µi − ci hξj′ , 2ρ(ui ∩ p)i
                                  = cj hξj′ , 2ρ′n i − ci hξj′ , 2ρ(ui ∩ p)i.
Recall now that we chose i to maximize ci . In particular we must have cj ≤ ci .
Since the coefficient of cj on the right in (6.7g) is positive (Lemma 6.9), we
deduce
                                                              
(6.7h) h(ξji )′ , µi i ≤ ci hξj′ , 2ρ′n i − hξj′ , 2ρ(ui ∩ p)i = ci hξj′ , 2ρ′n − 2ρ(ui ∩ p)i.
Now (6.7e) and the fact that ci ≤ 1 (cf. (6.4b)) show that (6.7h) implies the
inequality (6.7d). This completes the proof of Lemma 6.10, and therefore of
Theorem 6.7.

     We want next to explore some formal consequences of the characterizations
of unitarily small K-types in Theorem 6.7. We will apply the following lemma
to the set of roots of T c in p.

     Lemma 6.11.         Use the notation of (0.3). Suppose S ⊂ i(tc0 )∗ is an
arbitrary finite subset invariant under the Weyl group of K:
                             w·S ⊂S             (w ∈ W (K, T )).
Define                        (                                    )
                               X
                    R(S) =             bs s     (0 ≤ bs ≤ 1)           ⊂ i(tc0 )∗ .
                                 s∈S

Then R(S) is convex and invariant under W (K). The following conditions on
                                  b are equivalent.
an irreducible representation δ ∈ K
 a)   Every weight of δ belongs to R(S).
 b)   Every extremal weight of δ belongs to R(S).
 c)   Every highest weight of δ belongs to R(S).
 d)   Some highest weight of δ belongs to R(S).
 e)   Some extremal weight of δ belongs to R(S).
1108         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


    We will say that a representation of K (even reducible) is of type S if these
conditions are satisfied.

     Proof. That R(S) is convex and W (K) invariant is obvious, as are the
implications (a) ⇒ (b) ⇒ (c) ⇒ (d) ⇒ (e). We will complete the proof by
showing that (e) ⇒ (b) ⇒ (a). So assume (e) holds. The set of extremal
weights of δ is a single orbit of W (K), so (b) follows by the W (K) invariance
of R(S). Now assume (b). Every weight must lie in the convex hull of the
extremal weights. (For connected K this is a consequence of Proposition 1.7,
and the general case follows at once.) So the convexity of R(S) shows that (b)
implies (a).

     Corollary 6.12.        Suppose G is a real reductive group in Harish-
Chandra’s class, and K is a maximal compact subgroup; use the notation of
                                                                     b are
(6.1). The following conditions on an irreducible representation δ ∈ K
equivalent.
 a) The K-type δ is unitarily small.
 b) The restriction δs of δ to Gs ∩ K is of type ∆(p, tc ) (Lemma 6.11).
 c) Write µz ∈ iz∗c,0 for the differential of the character of Zc on δ. Then δ is
    of type {µz } ∪ ∆(p, tc ).
    Proof. In light of Lemmas 6.11 and 6.5, this is a reformulation of the
equivalence of (a) and (g) in Theorem 6.7.
     Before we embark on a more serious investigation of unitarily small K-
types, we want to describe the unitarily small parameters of Definition 6.1.
The result (Proposition 6.13) is fairly simple, but the proof is a little involved.
We need to extend somewhat the notation introduced in (6.1). Recall that
gs,0 = [g0 , g0 ] is the derived algebra of g0 . It is a direct sum of simple ideals
(Lemma 6.6). Write
(6.8a)         gc,0 = sum of the compact simple factors of gs,0 .
The corresponding subgroup Gc of Gs is compact, connected, and semisimple.
Therefore it has finite center; so in particular the intersection
(6.8b)                        Fc = Z(Gc ) ∩ Z ⊂ Zc
of its center with the identity component of the center of G must be finite.

    Proposition 6.13.        Assume the setting of Definition 6.1; use also the
notation of (6.1) and (6.8). The set Λzu (G) of unitarily small parameters for
G consists precisely of the differentials of characters of Zc /Fc .

     Proof. Suppose δ ∈ Buz (G) is a unitarily small representation of K. It is
clear from conditions (f) or (g) of Theorem 6.7 that δ must be trivial on Gc .
               CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                   1109

(This was essentially proved in Lemma 6.8.) The restriction of δ to Zc therefore
defines a character µz of Zc /Fc , and Lemma 6.5 shows that the corresponding
unitarily small parameter is the differential of µz .
     Conversely, suppose µz is a character of Zc /Fc . We must show how to
extend µz to a unitarily small representation of K. The problem is easily
reduced to the identity component of G, so we assume henceforth that G is
connected. Define
(6.9a)        Gn = identity component of the centralizer in G of Gc .
Clearly this is a closed connected reductive subgroup of G. On the level of Lie
algebras it is easy to prove a direct sum decomposition
(6.9b)                            g0 = gc,0 + gn,0 .
From this it follows that the multiplication map defines a surjective covering
homomorphism
(6.9c)                            Gc × Gn → G.
Define
(6.9d)                 F = Gc ∩ Gn = Z(Gc ) ∩ Z(Gn ).
This is a finite central subgroup of both factors. Its intersection with the
identity component of the center of Gn is just the group Fc defined in (6.8b).
The kernel of the multiplication map is
(6.9e)               F∆ = {(f, f −1 ) | f ∈ F } ⊂ Gc × Gn .
Now (6.9) allows us to describe the representation theory of G completely in
terms of the representation theory of Gc and Gn separately. Here is an example.

     Lemma 6.14.       Suppose G is connected; use the notation of (6.9). The
irreducible representations δ of K are in one-to-one correspondence with pairs
                                       bc × (Gn ∩ K)b,
                          (δc , δn ) ∈ G
subject to the requirement that
                                    δc |F = δn |F .

    Proof. Because of (6.9), the multiplication map defines an isomorphism
                          K ≃ (Gc × (Gn ∩ K))/F∆ .
The representations of the direct product Gc × (Gn ∩ K) are tensor products,
and so correspond to pairs (δc , δn ). The requirement in the lemma is exactly
what is needed to make δc ⊗ δn trivial on F∆ .
1110         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


    We now set out to construct a unitarily small representation of K from
our character µz of Zc /Fc . As a first step, consider the subgroup F Zc of Gn .
Because F ∩ Zc = Fc ,
(6.10a)                         F Zc /F ≃ Zc /Fc .
So we begin by regarding µz as a character of F Zc /F . Because this is a compact
central subgroup of Gn , we can find an irreducible representation δn1 of Gn ∩ K
such that
(6.10b)                           δn1 |F Zc = µz .
If δn1 were unitarily small, then C ⊗δn1 would be a unitarily small representation
of K restricting to µz , and we would be done. But δn1 may not be unitarily
small, so we need to work a little harder.
       Write Tn for our fixed maximal torus in Gn ∩ K (the intersection of T c
with Gn ), and µ1n ∈ Tbn for any weight of δn1 . By hypothesis
(6.10c)                           µ1n |F Zc = µz .
On the other hand, Gn has no compact simple factors. By Lemma 6.9, this
implies that the noncompact roots span the semisimple part of it∗n,0 . We may
therefore write
                                X
(6.10d)             µ1n = µz +        b1β β   (b1β ∈ R).
                                 β∈∆(p,tn )

For each noncompact root β, choose an integer nβ so that
(6.10e)                       bβ = b1β + nβ ∈ [0, 1].

Now define µn ∈ Tbc to be µ1n twisted by the sum of the various nβ β:
                                        X
(6.10f)                   µn = µ1n +          nβ β.
                                            β∈∆(p,tn )

Because the roots are characters of Tn , this is well-defined. Because the center
of Gn acts trivially on the roots, (6.10c) implies
(6.10g)                           µn |F Zc = µz .
Finally, (6.10d–f) give
                                 X
(6.10h)            µn = µz +                bβ β         (0 ≤ bβ ≤ 1).
                               β∈∆(p,tn )

Now define δn to be the unique irreducible representation of Gn ∩K of extremal
weight µn . By Lemma 6.11, the highest weight of δn has an expression of the
same form as in (6.10h). By Theorem 6.7, δn is unitarily small. By Lemma
                    CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                     1111

6.14, δ = C ⊗ δn is a unitarily small representation of K, and the restriction of
δ to Zc is µz by (6.10g).


            7. Unitarily small K-types and the Dirac operator

     Proposition 7.1. In the setting of Definition 6.1, any irreducible repre-
                                                V
sentation of K appearing in the exterior algebra p (notation (0.2)) is unitarily
                                             V
small. More precisely, the representation p is of type ∆(p, tc ) (cf. Lemma
6.11).
    Proof. The weights of the exterior algebra of p are those of the form
                        X
                              bβ β,     (bβ = 0 or 1).
                           β∈∆(p,tc )
            V
Therefore       p is of type ∆(p, t). Now apply Corollary 6.12.
     In the theory of unitary representations, the interaction between the K-
          V
types of p and certain spinor representations plays an important role. In
this section we will outline this theory, and show how to extend parts of it to
all unitarily small representations.
     Our development is taken from [4, Chapter II] and [2, II.6]. We will
indicate particularly large departures from their conventions. We begin with
a finite-dimensional real inner product space (V0 , h , i). Set
(7.1a)        SO(V0 ) = special orthogonal group of V0 ,           V = V0 ⊗R C.
The Clifford algebra C(V0 ) is the real associative algebra with unit generated
by V0 and subject to the relations
(7.1b)                      v 2 = −hv, vi · 1     (v ∈ V0 ).
(For Chevalley this is the Clifford algebra of the form −h , i.) Sometimes it is
convenient to write the defining relations in the equivalent form
(7.1c)                  vw + wv = −2hv, wi         (v, w ∈ V0 ).
Obviously SO(V0 ) (and even the full orthogonal group O(V0 )) acts on C(V0 )
by algebra automorphisms. The action of −1 ∈ O(V0 ) defines a Z/2Z-grading
(7.1d)                     C(V0 ) = C(V0 )even + C(V0 )odd .
There is an algebra antiautomorphism transpose of C(V0 ), characterized by
                t             t
(7.1e)          v = −v,        (ab) = t b ta    (v ∈ V0 , a, b ∈ C(V0 )).
(Chevalley emphasizes the antiautomorphism α that acts by +1 on V0 . It
differs from transpose by the action of −1 ∈ O(V0 ).) The Clifford algebra is
1112         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


filtered by assigning the generators degree 1. Write Cp (V0 ) for the pth level of
the filtration. Then there is a natural isomorphism
                                                 ^p
(7.1f)                     Cp (V0 )/Cp−1 (V0 ) ≃    V0

respecting the algebra structure and the Z/2Z-grading. It follows easily that
there is a natural isomorphism
(7.1g)                           C1 (V0 )odd ≃ V0 ;
the map from right to left just sends the space V0 of generators into C(V0 ).
     Write C(V0 )× for the group of invertible elements of C(V0 ). Because
C(V0 ) is a finite-dimensional associative algebra with a unit, C(V0 )× is an
open subset. It is a Lie group; the Lie algebra is C(V0 ) with the commutator
bracket. This group acts on C(V0 ) by conjugation:
(7.2a)
 Ad: C(V0 )× → Aut(C(V0 )), Ad(u)(a) = uau−1 (u ∈ C(V0 )× , a ∈ C(V0 )).
The differential of this representation is the action of C(V0 ) on itself by bracket.
The subgroup C(V0 )×   even acts in Ad to preserve the Z/2Z grading. We now
define the spin group of V0 as
(7.2b)         Spin(V0 ) = {g ∈ C(V0 )×                        t    −1
                                      even | Ad(g)(V0 ) ⊂ V0 , g = g }.

This is the group that Chevalley calls the reduced Clifford group Γ+    0 . The
first condition here may also be expressed as requiring Ad(g) to preserve the
filtration of 7.1(f). By construction, Spin(V0 ) is an algebraic group, and the
adjoint action provides an algebraic homomorphism
                              τ : Spin(V0 ) → GL(V0 ).
Because Ad preserves the algebra structure, the relation (7.1b) shows that the
image of τ is contained in O(V0 ):
(7.2c)                         τ : Spin(V0 ) → O(V0 ).



    Lemma 7.2. The image of the map τ of (7.2c) is the special orthogonal
group SO(V0 ). The kernel consists of the two scalar elements ±1 in the center
of C(V0 ). If dim V0 ≥ 2, this kernel is contained in the identity component of
Spin(V0 ); so in that case Spin(V0 ) is a connected double cover of SO(V0 ).

     Proposition 7.3.       The Clifford algebra C(V0 ) is a semisimple algebra
of dimension 2 dim V0 . Write Z = Z(C(V0 )) for the center.
     Suppose that dim V0 = 2r is even. Then Z consists only of the scalars C0 .
Consequently C(V0 ) and its complexification are both central simple algebras.
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                    1113

In particular, C(V0 ) has a unique complex simple module (γ, S) (up to equiv-
alence), of dimension 2r . Regard γ as a representation of the group C(V0 )× .
Write σ for the restriction of γ to the subgroup Spin(V0 ). If r ≥ 1, then σ is
the direct sum of two inequivalent irreducible representations (σ± , S± ), each of
dimension 2r−1 .
     Suppose that dim V0 = 2r + 1 is odd. Then Z is two-dimensional; it is
spanned by the scalars and an odd element z− , satisfying
(a)                            (z− )2 = ±1 ∈ C0 .
The subalgebra C(V0 )even has dimension 22r and one-dimensional center ; it is
central simple, and generated as an algebra by Spin(V0 ). The entire Clifford
algebra is a tensor product
(b)                        C(V0 ) ≃ Z ⊗R C(V0 )even .
There is a unique complex simple module (γeven , S) for C(V0 )even (up to equiv-
alence), of dimension 2r . The restriction of γ to Spin(V0 ) is an irreducible
representation (σ, S). There are exactly two extensions γ and γ ′ of γeven to a
module for C(V0 ) (on the same space S); they are related by
(c)                       γ(v) = −γ ′ (v)       (v ∈ V0 ).
Any complex simple module for C(V0 ) is isomorphic to exactly one of γ
and γ ′ .
     In either case, suppose (γ, S) is a simple module for C(V0 ). Then there
is a positive definite invariant Hermitian form h , i on S. This means that
γ(a)∗ = γ(ta), or explicitly that
(d)                         hγ(a)s, s′ i = hs, γ(ta)s′ i.
This form is unique up to a positive scalar multiple. In particular, the repre-
sentation (σ, S) of Spin(V0 ) is unitary.

     We should make two remarks about the notation introduced in this propo-
sition. There is no preferred choice between the two irreducible constituents
of the spin representation in the even-dimensional case; to call one of them σ+
is to make a choice. Similarly, there is no preferred extension of γeven in the
odd-dimensional case; calling one γ is making a choice.
     This proposition summarizes several results in Chapter 2 of [4]. (The
formulation in II.6.2 of [2] is not quite correct in the odd-dimensional case,
when it overlooks the nonuniqueness of the extension of γeven to C(V0 ).)

     Definition 7.4. Suppose we are in the setting 7.1–7.2. A space of spinors
for V0 is a complex simple module (γ, S) for the Clifford algebra C(V0 ), en-
dowed with a positive definite invariant Hermitian form h , i, as described in
1114         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


Proposition 7.3. We write (σ, S) for the corresponding unitary representation
of Spin(V0 ); we will sometimes call σ a spin representation. By 7.2(a) and the
definition of σ,
        γ(Ad(g)(a)) = σ(g)γ(a)σ(g −1 )       (g ∈ Spin(V0 ), a ∈ C(V0 )).

     Example 7.5. Suppose V0 is a one-dimensional space Rv0 , and that v0 has
length one. Then SO(V0 ) is trivial. The Clifford algebra C(V0 ) is generated
by v0 with the relation v02 = −1; that is, C(V0 ) is isomorphic to the algebra C
of complex numbers. There are two possible isomorphisms, sending v0 to i or
to −i. The even subalgebra is
                              C(V0 )even = R ⊂ C,
and the odd subspace is iR. The transpose automorphism is complex conjuga-
tion, so we see that
                            Spin(V0 ) = ±1 ⊂ R× .
The unique complex simple module for C(V0 )even is just C; the two possible
extensions to C(V0 ) have v0 acting by ±i. (The distinction between these is
not just a matter of choosing i ∈ C; we must also choose between v0 and −v0
as a basis element of V0 .)

     Example 7.6. Suppose V0 is two-dimensional, with an orthonormal basis
{j, k}. Then SO(V0 ) consists of the 2 × 2 matrices
                                                     
                                         cos θ − sin θ
(a)               SO(V0 ) = r(θ) =                        .
                                         sin θ   cos θ
The Clifford algebra has basis {1, j, k, jk}, with relations
(b)                       j 2 = k2 = −1,    jk = −kj.
This is evidently isomorphic to the algebra of quaternions
(c)                         H = {a + bi + cj + dk}

by sending jk to i. The transpose antiautomorphism is the usual conjugation
of quaternions (which is −1 on i, j, and k). The even subalgebra is
(d)                           C(V0 )even = C ⊂ H.
It is not difficult to check from (d) and the definition (7.2b) that
(e)               Spin(V0 ) = {s(φ) = cos φ + i sin φ | φ ∈ R} .
The conjugation action on V0 is
(f)                             τ (s(φ)) = r(2φ).
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                   1115

To see that, one calculates for example
             τ (s(φ))j = (cos φ + i sin φ)j(cos φ − i sin φ)
                        = j cos2 φ − iji sin2 φ + (ij − ji) sin φ cos φ
                        = j(cos2 φ − sin2 φ) + k(2 sin φ cos φ)
                        = j cos 2φ + k sin 2φ
                        = r(2φ)j.
Therefore Spin(V0 ) is the double cover of the circle SO(V0 ). The unique com-
plex simple module for C(V0 ) may be realized on S = C2 by
                                                              
                    0 1                  0 i                  i 0
(g)      γ(j) =             , γ(k) =            , γ(i) =             .
                   −1 0                  i 0                  0 −i
The natural decomposition C2 = C + C gives a Spin(V0 )-invariant decompo-
sition S = S+ + S− . Combining (e) with the third formula in (g), we see
that
(h)                           σ± (r(φ)) = exp(±iφ).
That is, the two half-spin representations σ± are the first two characters of the
circle Spin(V0 ).
    One reason for considering these two examples in such detail is that many
aspects of general Clifford algebras and spin representations can be reduced to
dimensions one and two. In order to understand how, we need a little more
notation.
    Suppose first that W0 ⊂ V0 is any subspace. We immediately get a natural
map of Clifford algebras
(7.3a)                           C(W0 ) → C(V0 )
respecting Z/2Z gradings, filtrations, and the transpose. By (7.1f) this map is
one-to-one; we use it to identify C(W0 ) as a subalgebra of C(V0 ). It is clear
from the definition in 7.2 that (7.3a) induces an inclusion of groups
(7.3b)                        Spin(W0 ) ֒→ Spin(V0 ).
Suppose now that U0 is a second subspace of V0 , and that
(7.3c)                       U0 is orthogonal to W0 .
Then (7.1c) says that
(7.3d)               wu + uw = 0          (u ∈ U0 , w ∈ W0 ).
From this we can get complete commutation or anticommutation rules for even
and odd elements of C(U0 ) and C(V0 ); but we will be content with
(7.3e)           ab − ba = 0        (a ∈ C(W0 )even , b ∈ C(U0 )).
1116         SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


In particular,
(7.3f)                 Spin(W0 ) and Spin(U0 ) commute.
The isomorphism (7.1f) also shows that C(W0 ) and C(U0 ) meet only in their
common scalars. Lemma 7.2 therefore shows that
(7.3g)                      Spin(W0 ) ∩ Spin(U0 ) = {±1},
                     Spin(W0 ) ×{±1} Spin(U0 ) ֒→ Spin(V0 ).
Here the notation means that we divide the product group by the diagonal
copy of {±1}.
     The formula (7.3f) suggests that an orthogonal decomposition of V0 ought
to give rise to a tensor product decomposition of the Clifford algebra. This
is complicated by the strange shape of the commutation relation (7.3d). The
following bit of extra structure will allow us to circumvent this.
    Definition 7.7. Suppose we are in the setting 7.1–7.2, and that dim V0 is
even. A special element ε ∈ Spin(V0 ) is one satisfying
                                  τ (ε) = −1 ∈ SO(V0 ).
      Such an element exists and is unique up to sign by Lemma 7.2. Because
τ (ε2 ) = 1, we must have ε2 = ±1. In Example 7.6, ε = s(π/2) = i is a special
element of square −1. If V0 = 0, then ε = ±1 are special elements of square 1.
It turns out that ε2 = (−1)r when dim V0 = 2r, but we will not need this.
     Proposition 7.8 ([4, II.2.5]).          In the setting 7.1–7.2, suppose that there
is an orthogonal decomposition
(a)                                    V0 = W 0 + U 0 ,
and that dim W0 is even. Choose a special element ε ∈ Spin(W0 ) ⊂ C(W0 )even .
    Suppose first that ε2 = 1. Then there is an isomorphism of algebras
(b)                         jR : C(W0 ) ⊗R C(U0 ) → C(V0 ),
defined by
                            
                                ab,    if a ∈ C(W0 ) and b ∈ C(U0 )even ;
(c)          jR (a ⊗ b) =
                                aεb,   if a ∈ C(W0 ) and b ∈ C(U0 )odd .
This isomorphism complexifies to
(d)                    jC : C(W0 )C ⊗C C(U0 )C → C(V0 )C .
     Suppose next that ε2 = −1. Then there is an isomorphism of complexified
algebras as in (d), given by
                       
                         ab,   if a ∈ C(W0 )C and b ∈ C(U0 )C,even ;
(e)       jC (a ⊗ b) =
                         iaεb, if a ∈ C(W0 )C and b ∈ C(U0 )C,odd .

     Suppose (γ(W0 ), S(W0 )) and (γ(U0 ), S(U0 )) are complex simple modules
for C(W0 ) and C(U0 ) (Proposition 7.3). Then
(f)                             S = S(W0 ) ⊗ S(U0 )
is a simple module for C(V0 ) under the isomorphism jC of (d). In this way
the restriction of the spin representation σ(V0 ) of Spin(V0 ) to the subgroup
Spin(W0 )Spin(U0 ) (Def. 7.4 and (7.3g)) is identified with the tensor product of
the spin representations of the factors:
(g)                  σ(V0 )|Spin(W0 )Spin(U0 ) ≃ σ(W0 ) ⊗ σ(U0 ).

      Corollary 7.9. In the setting 7.1–7.2, suppose dim V0 = 2r + δ, with δ
equal to 0 or 1. Choose a collection of r orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces
W1 , . . . , Wr of V0 . Recall from Example 7.6 that each group Spin(Wi ) is a
double cover of the circle group SO(Wi ), with two-element kernel ±1i :
                     1 → {±1i } → Spin(Wi ) → SO(Wi ) → 1.
Write
                   T (W1 , . . . , Wr ) = SO(W1 ) × · · · × SO(Wr ),
             Te(W1 , . . . , Wr ) = Spin(W1 ) ×{±1} · · · ×{±1} Spin(Wr ).
Here the second definition means the quotient of the direct product by the sub-
group generated by all elements (−1i )(−1j ) (1 ≤ i, j ≤ r). This is a double
cover of the corresponding product of orthogonal groups:
              1 → {±1} → Te(W1 , . . . , Wr ) → T (W1 , . . . , Wr ) → 1.

 a) The group T (W1 , . . . , Wr ) is a maximal torus in SO(V0 ).
 b) The group Te(W1 , . . . , Wr ) may be naturally identified as a subgroup of
    Spin(V0 ); it is a maximal torus.
 c) Write ±βi for the two weights of SO(Wi ) on (Wi )C ; extend them to all of
    T (W1 , . . . , Wr ) by making them trivial on the other factors SO(Wj ). Then
    the weights of T (W1 , . . . , Wr ) on (V0 )C are {±β1 , . . . , ±βr }, together with
    0 if δ = 1.
 d) The weights of the spin representation σ(V0 ) of Spin(V0 ) are the 2r weights
    {1/2(±β1 ± · · · ± βr )}.

     Corollary 7.10 ([2, Lemma II.6.5]).            In the setting 7.1–7.2, choose a
spin representation (σ, S) (Def. 7.4). Then       the tensor product representation
σ ⊗ σ of Spin(V0 ) descends to SO(V0 ) by the     map of (7.2c). As representations
of SO(V0 ),

     Finally we introduce the Dirac operator. In the setting (0.2), recall that
our fixed bilinear form h , i is positive definite on p0 . We will make the
constructions based on 7.1–7.2 with p0 playing the role of V0 . The adjoint
action of K on p0 preserves the form, and so defines a homomorphism
(7.4a)                          Ad: K → O(p0 ).
Of course the identity component K0 is mapped to SO(p0 ). Recall from (7.2c)
and Lemma 7.2 that we also have a spin double cover of SO(p0 ). This covering
pulls back by Ad to a double cover of K0 . More precisely, we define
(7.4b)          e 0 = {(k, g) ∈ K0 × Spin(p0 ) | Ad(k) = τ (g)}.
                K
Then projection on the first factor defines a short exact sequence
(7.4c)                              e 0 → K0 → 1.
                         1 → {±1} → K
Similarly, projection on the second factor defines a homomorphism
(7.4d)                        f K
                              Ad: e 0 → Spin(p0 ).

Fix now a space of spinors (γ, S) for p0 (Definition 7.4). By composition with
f the spin representation defines a representation
Ad,
(7.4e)                                  f S)
                                   (σ ◦ Ad,
of Ke 0 on S. We call this the spin representation of K e 0 , and often denote it
simply σ.
     Suppose now that X is a (g, K)-module. Often we can understand very
well the action of K on X, in terms of the Cartan-Weyl theory of finite-
dimensional representations. What remains, therefore, is to understand the
action of p0 on X. The Dirac operator provides a way to compare this action
with the action of p0 on S by Clifford multiplication. Because the latter action
is also well understood, the problem of understanding X is to some extent
reduced to understanding the Dirac operator.

     Definition 7.11. Suppose G is a reductive group as in (0.2). Use the
notation of (7.4), so that in particular we have chosen a space (γ, S) of spinors
for p0 . Suppose that (π, X) is a representation of g. The Dirac operator for X
is an endomorphism D of X ⊗ S, defined as follows. Let {Yi } be a basis of p0 ,
and {Y j } the dual basis:
(a)                              hYi , Y j i = δij .
Then the Dirac operator on X ⊗ S is
                              X
(b)                       D=      π(Yi ) ⊗ γ(Y i ).

                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                   1119

      The construction of a Dirac operator therefore requires a choice of a space
of spinors. We saw in Proposition 7.3 that if p0 is odd-dimensional, there are
two inequivalent choices for such a space. It is natural to ask how changing the
choice affects the Dirac operator. Proposition 7.3 shows that the two choices
γ and γ ′ may be realized on a common space S, and that they are related by
γ(Y ) = −γ ′ (Y ) (for Y ∈ p0 ). The two Dirac operators D and D ′ on X ⊗ S are
then related by D = −D ′ . We will be interested mostly in the eigenvalues of
D 2 ; they are of course unaffected by such a change.

    Proposition 7.12 (Parthasarathy [14, Lemma 2.5]; see also [13,
Prop. 3.1], and [2, Lemma II.6.11]).
 a) In the setting of Definition 7.11, the operator D is independent of the
    choice of basis {Yi }.
 b) Write ΩG for the Casimir operator of G, and ΩK for the Casimir operator
    of K ([8, p. 209). Then

               D 2 = −π(ΩG ) ⊗ 1 + (π ⊗ σ)(ΩK ) − (hρ, ρi − hρc , ρc i).

    Here ρc is as defined in (0.4e), and ρ is half the sum of any set of positive
    roots for g.
 c) Suppose that X is a Hermitian representation of g0 . Then D is formally
    self-adjoint with respect to the tensor product Hermitian structure on X
    ⊗ S:
                       hDx, yi = hx, Dyi      (x, y ∈ X ⊗ S).

 d) Suppose X is a (g, K)-module. Then X ⊗ S is a locally finite represen-
              e 0 for the tensor product action π ⊗ σ. The Dirac operator D
    tation of K
    intertwines this action.
 e) Suppose X is a unitary (g, K)-module, and that π(ΩG ) is a scalar operator.
    Then D 2 has nonnegative eigenvalues on X⊗S. In particular, suppose that
    X has an infinitesimal character corresponding by the Harish-Chandra
    parametrization to a weight φ(X) ∈ h∗ . Let µ
                                                e ∈ (tc )∗ be the highest weight
    of any representation of Ke 0 on X ⊗ S. Then

                          he
                           µ + ρc , µ
                                    e + ρc i ≥ hφ(X), φ(X)i.

     Proof. Part (a) is entirely elementary; the argument is omitted in any of
the references mentioned. A version of (b) (essentially for X equal to C ∞ (G))
is proved in [13]; the observation that Parthasarathy’s argument applies in the
present setting appears in all the other references. For part (c), the Hermitian
property of π means that the operators π(Yi ) are skew-adjoint. By (7.1e) and
(7.3d), the Clifford multiplication operators γ(Y i ) are skew-adjoint. By (b) of

                                                                      e ∈ K
     For (d), the first assertion is trivial. For the second, suppose k     e0;
write k ∈ K0 for its image by (7.4c). Then

                                                      i

Here we have used for π the compatibility of the group and Lie algebra repre-
sentations, and for γ the condition in Definition 7.4. Because {Ad(k)Yi } is a
basis of p0 and {Ad(k)Y i } is the dual basis (by the K-invariance of our bilinear
form), it follows from (a) that the right side of (7.5a) is D, proving (d).
     For (e), part (b) shows that D 2 is diagonalizable. If x is a nonzero eigen-
vector of eigenvalue c, then it follows from (c) that
(7.5b)                          c = hDx, Dxi/hx, xi.
Because the form on X is positive, the form on X ⊗ S is positive as well; so the
denominator in (7.5b) is positive and the numerator nonnegative. Therefore
c ≥ 0, as we wished to show. For the last inequality, the eigenvalues of D 2 are
computed by (b). Under the assumptions in (e), we find first of all that
(7.5c)                    π(ΩG ) = hφ(X), φ(X)i − hρ, ρi.
(This standard formula is proved for example in [7, Ex. 4, p. 134].) Let δe be a
                  e 0 of highest weight µ
representation of K                     e; then for the same reason we have
(7.5d)                  e K ) = he
                        δ(Ω      µ + ρc , µ
                                          e + ρc i − hρc , ρc i.
Suppose now that x ∈ X ⊗ S transforms according to the representation δ.  e
Then the formulas in (b) and (7.5c) and (7.5d) show that x is an eigenvector
for D 2 . The eigenvalue c is equal to
(7.5e)
  −(hφ(X), φ(X)i − hρ, ρi) + (he
                               µ + ρc , µ
                                        e + ρc i − hρc , ρc i) − (hρ, ρi − hρc , ρc i)
                              = he
                                 µ + ρc , µ
                                          e + ρc i − hφ(X), φ(X)i.
The nonnegativity of c is therefore the last inequality in (e).

     The inequality in Proposition 7.12(e) is sufficiently important that we
state it separately, in a slightly strengthened form.

     Proposition 7.13 (Parthasarathy’s Dirac operator inequality; see [14,
Lemma 2.5]). Suppose G is a reductive group as in (0.2), and X is an irre-
ducible Hermitian (g, K)-module. Suppose that X has infinitesimal character
corresponding by the Harish-Chandra parametrization to a weight φ(X) ∈ h∗ .
Recall from Definition 5.6 the canonical real part RE φ(X) ∈ it∗0 + a∗0 . Fix a
                                    e be the highest weight of a representation δe
space S of spinors for p0 , and let µ
   e
of K0 occurring in X ⊗ S.
                  CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                      1121

       List the representations of K0 occurring in δe ⊗ σ as {δ1 , . . . , δr }. Assume
that
              the Hermitian form on X is positive on the K0 -types δi .
(This is automatic if X is unitary.) Then
                      he
                       µ + ρc , µ
                                e + ρc i ≥ hRE φ(X), RE φ(X)i.

    The improvement over the inequality in Proposition 7.12(e) takes two
forms. First, the positivity of the Hermitian form on X is assumed only on a
specific finite set of K0 -types, and not on the entire representation. Second,
we have replaced φ(X) by its canonical real part. To see that this is an im-
provement, write φ(X) = RE φ(X) + iIM φ(X). Then the squared length of
φ(X) is
(7.6a) hRE φ(X), RE φ(X)i − hIM φ(X), IM φ(X)i + 2ihRE φ(X), IM φ(X)i.
The inner product is real and positive definite on the image of RE and IM;
so the first term here is positive, the second negative, and the third purely
imaginary. On a Hermitian representation the Casimir operator must have a
real eigenvalue, so the third term is zero; and we get
(7.6b)                  hφ(X), φ(X)i ≤ hRE φ(X), RE φ(X)i.
This says that the inequality in Proposition 7.13 implies the one in Proposition
7.12(e).

     Proof. Write X0 for the K0 -invariant subspace of X generated by the iso-
typic subspaces of type δi . Suppose x ∈ X ⊗S is a nonzero vector transforming
                                 e Then it follows from the definition of {δi }
according to the representation δ.
that x ∈ X0 ⊗ S. By Proposition 7.12(d), Dx also transforms according to
e so Dx ∈ X0 ⊗ S. By hypothesis, our Hermitian form is positive definite on
δ,
X0 ⊗ S; so
(7.7a)                           hDx, Dxi/hx, xi ≥ 0.
Now the same calculation as in (7.5b) and (7.5e) shows that
(7.7b)                    he
                           µ + ρc , µ
                                    e + ρc i ≥ hφ(X), φ(X)i.
To get the canonical real part into the picture, we use Theorem 16.10 in [8].
The result is of sufficient interest to state separately.

    Proposition 7.14 ([8, Th. 1 6.10]). Suppose G is a real reductive group
in Harish-Chandra’s class, and (X, h , i) is an irreducible Hermitian (g, K)-
module. Suppose H is a θ-stable Cartan subgroup of G, and that the infinitesi-
mal character of X is given in the Harish-Chandra parametrization by a weight
1122          SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


φ(X) ∈ h∗ . Then there exist a parabolic subgroup P1 = M1 A1 N1 of G, an irre-
ducible Hermitian Harish-Chandra module X1 for M1 , and a unitary character
ν1 ∈ ia∗1,0 , with the following three properties.
 a) The infinitesimal character of X1 has a Harish-Chandra parameter that is
    conjugate by Ad(g) to RE φ(X).
 b) The weight ν1 is conjugate by Ad(g) to iIM φ(X).
 c) There is an isomorphism of Hermitian representations
                           X ≃ IndG               ν1
                                  M1 A1 N1 (X1 ⊗ e ⊗ 1).

       Consider the Hermitian representation
                         X ′ = IndG
                                  M1 A1 N1 (X1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1);

this is a (g, K)-module of finite length.
 d) The representations X and X ′ are isomorphic as Hermitian represen-
    tations of K. In particular, their signature characters coincide (Defini-
    tion 5.3).
 e) The infinitesimal character of X ′ is just that of X1 ⊗ 1 composed with
    a Harish-Chandra homomorphism, and is therefore given in the Harish-
    Chandra parametrization by the weight
                                 φ(X ′ ) = RE φ(X).

     Proof. Parts (a)–(c) are essentially proved in [8, Th. 16.10]. Part (d) fol-
lows immediately from the construction of the Hermitian form on a paraboli-
cally induced representation in the “compact picture.” Part (e) is a standard
calculation of infinitesimal characters of induced representations ([8, Prop.
8.22]).

     Returning to the proof of Proposition 7.12, we now apply Proposition 7.12
to the representation X. By (d), the representation X ′ inherits the positivity
assumption made on the K-types of X. We may also identify the element x
with an element of X ′ ⊗ S, still transforming by δ.e Applying the inequality
(7.7b) to the representation X ′ therefore gives the conclusion we want.

    Now we will relate these ideas to the notion of unitarily small K-types.
Here is a classical fact that hints at what we want.

     Proposition 7.15.         Suppose G is a connected reductive group as in
(0.2), and (σ, S) is a spin representation for p0 (a representation of K e 0 ; see
(7.4)). Suppose δ is a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of K. Then
the following conditions on δ are equivalent.
                                     V
  a) The representation δ occurs in p.
                 CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                         1123

 b) There is an irreducible constituent σ1 of σ so that δ⊗σ1 contains a K e 0 -type
    in S.
 c) There are irreducible constituents σ1 and σ2 of σ so that δ occurs in σ1 ⊗σ2 .

    This is an easy consequence of Corollary 7.10; we omit the argument. By
Proposition 7.1, a representation δ satisfying these conditions is unitarily small.
What we want to do is weaken the conditions until they are precisely equivalent
to unitarily small. We begin with some properties of the spin representation.

     Lemma 7.16 ([2, Lemma II.6.9]).       Suppose G is a connected reductive
group as in (0.2), and (σ, S) is a spin representation for p0 (a representation
   e 0 ; see (7.4)).
of K
 a) The representation σ is of type 12 ∆(p, tc ) (Lemma 6.11). That is, every
    weight of σ is a sum of noncompact roots with coefficients between −1/2
    and 1/2.
 b) Suppose ∆+ (g, tc ) is a system of positive roots containing ∆+ (k, tc ). Then
                                              X
                                 ρn = 1/2            β
                                             β∈∆+ (p,tc )

    is a highest weight of σ. Similarly −ρn is a lowest weight of σ.
 c) Every highest weight of σ is of the form in (b).

     Proposition 7.17.        Suppose G is a semisimple group as in (0.2), and
(σ, S) is a spin representation for p0 . Suppose δ is an irreducible representation
of K. In the notation of Definition 6.1, the following conditions on δ are
equivalent.
 a) The representation δ is unitarily small.
 b) There is an irreducible constituent σ1 of σ and an irreducible constituent
    σ2 of δ ⊗ σ1 so that σ2 is of type 12 ∆(p, tc ) (Lemma 6.11). That is, every
    weight of σ2 is a sum of noncompact roots with coefficients between −1/2
    and 1/2.
 c) There is an irreducible constituent σ1 of σ and an irreducible representa-
    tion σ2 of type 21 ∆(p, tc ), with the property that δ|K0 contains an irreducible
    constituent of σ1 ⊗ σ2 .
 d) There are irreducible representations σ1 and σ2 of K       e 0 , of type 1 ∆(p, tc ),
                                                                             2
    with the property that δ|K0 contains an irreducible constituent of σ1 ⊗ σ2 .

     Proof. We will prove that (a)⇒(b)⇒(c)⇒(d)⇒(a). So suppose (a) holds.
Let µ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ be a highest weight of δ. By Theorem 6.7(f), we can find a
positive root system ∆+ (g, tc ) so that
                              X
                      µ=              cβ β (0 ≤ cβ ≤ 1).

Write δ0 for an irreducible constituent of δ (as a representation of K0 ) of
highest weight µ, and σ1 for an irreducible constituent of σ of lowest weight
−ρn (Lemma 7.16(b)). By a theorem of Parthasarathy, Rao, and Varadarajan
([12, Cor. 1 to Th. 2.1]), there is an irreducible constituent σ2 of δ0 ⊗ σ1 of
extremal weight
                       X
         µ − ρn =                  (cβ − 1/2)β    (−1/2 ≤ cβ − 1/2 ≤ 1/2).
                    β∈∆+ (p,tc )


By Lemma 6.11, σ2 is of type 12 ∆(p, tc ). This is (b). The implication (b)⇒(c)
is formal from the self-duality of S. That (c)⇒(d) is a formal consequence of
Lemma 7.16(a). Finally, assume (d). The weights of σ1 ⊗ σ2 are all of the form
γ1 + γ2 , with γi a weight of σi . It follows immediately that σ1 ⊗ σ2 is of type
∆(p, tc ). Now (a) follows from Theorem 6.7(g).

     We can now prove a result in the direction of Conjecture 5.7; more pre-
cisely, of Conjecture 5.7′ .

     Proposition 7.18.        Suppose G is a semisimple group, and suppose
X ∈ Π0h (G) is an irreducible Hermitian (g, K)-module (Definition 5.1). Let h
be a θ-stable Cartan subalgebra of g, and φ ∈ h∗ a weight parametrizing the
infinitesimal character of X. Assume that

                                   hRE φ, RE φi > hρ, ρi.

Then the Hermitian form on X must be indefinite on K-types in Bu0 (G).

     Proof. Suppose not. Then we may assume that the form is positive def-
inite on the K-types in Bu0 (G). By hypothesis X contains a unitarily small
K-type δ ∈ Bu0 (G). By Proposition 7.17, we can find a representation σ2 of
type 21 ∆(p, tc ) occurring in δ ⊗ σ, and therefore in X ⊗ S. We are going to
apply Proposition 7.12. We therefore list the representations of K containing
constituents of σ2 ⊗ σ as {δ1 , . . . , δr }. By Proposition 7.17(d), these are all
unitarily small; so by hypothesis the Hermitian form on X is positive on them.
Write µ2 for the highest weight of σ2 . According to Proposition 7.12,

(7.8a)                  hµ2 + ρc , µ2 + ρc i ≥ hRE φ, RE φi.

Fix a positive root system ∆+ (g, tc ) containing ∆+ (k, tc ), and write ρn for half
the sum of the corresponding noncompact positive roots. Because σ2 is of type

1       c
2 ∆(p, t ),   we can write
                         X
(7.8b)           µ2 =             (cβ − c−β )β        (0 ≤ c±β ≤ 1/2)
                       β∈∆+ (p,tc )
                          X
                   =                  aβ β            (−1/2 ≤ aβ ≤ 1/2)
                       β∈∆+ (p,tc )
                                 X
                   = ρn −                    bβ β     (0 ≤ bβ ≤ 1).
                             β∈∆+ (p,tc )

Adding ρc gives
                                      X
(7.8c)         µ 2 + ρc = ρ −                  bβ β   (0 ≤ bβ ≤ 1).
                                β∈∆+ (p,tc )

By Proposition 1.10, it follows that µ2 + ρc belongs to the convex hull of the
Weyl group orbit of ρ. Consequently
(7.8d)                          hµ2 + ρc , µ2 + ρc i ≤ hρ, ρi.
Combining this with (7.8a) gives hρ, ρi ≥ hRE φ, RE φi, contradicting the hy-
pothesis in the proposition. This contradiction completes the proof.

    This argument seems to us to be rather natural and powerful; so it is
disappointing that we cannot deduce Conjecture 5.7′ from it. Perhaps the
problem lies in Proposition 7.13. The following sharpening of that proposition
would (by the argument above) immediately imply Conjecture 5.7′ .

     Conjecture 7.13. Suppose we are in the setting of Proposition 7.13; make
the same hypotheses as for that proposition. Then RE φ(X) is conjugate by
Ad(g) to a weight in the convex hull of the Weyl group orbit of µ
                                                                e + ρc .

     We are being a little bit vague about the Weyl group in this conjecture;
probably it is enough to use the Weyl group W (g, tc ) of the restricted root
system, but the conjecture would still imply Conjecture 5.7′ even if we take
the full Weyl group W (g, hc ).

                         8. Topology of the unitary dual

     In this section we consider the relationship between the parametrization of
the unitary dual given (conjecturally) by Theorem 5.8 and the Fell topology. A
careful treatment of this topic would require a careful foundational discussion
of the Fell topology, which we prefer to avoid. Our arguments will therefore
be sketchy at several crucial points.
     We begin with a discussion of infinitesimal characters. Fix a θ-stable
positive root system ∆+ (g, hc ) for the Cartan subalgebra hc of (0.4a); this
1126          SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


choice is equivalent to the choice of a system ∆+ (g, tc ) of positive restricted
roots. We may assume that ∆+ (g, tc ) contains our fixed system ∆+ (k, tc ) of
positive roots for k.
     Definition 8.1. With notation as above, suppose φ ∈ (hc )∗ is a weight.
We say that φ is complex dominant if it satisfies either of the following equiv-
alent conditions.
 a) The canonical real part RE φ (Definition 5.6) is dominant for ∆+ (g, hc );
    and the canonical imaginary part IM φ is dominant for those positive roots
    orthogonal to RE φ.
 b) For every positive root α ∈ ∆+ (g, hc ), we have either Re hφ, αi > 0; or
    Re hφ, αi = 0, and Im hφ, αi > 0; or hφ, αi = 0.
       The set of complex dominant weights is denoted
                              CC (∆+ (g, hc )) ⊂ (hc )∗ .
It is a fundamental domain for the action of W (g, hc ) on (hc )∗ :
                        CC (∆+ (g, hc )) ≃ (hc )∗ /W (g, hc ).
We endow CC (∆+ (g, hc )) with the quotient topology from this bijection (and
not with the subspace topology from hc , which has more neighborhoods of
purely imaginary elements).
     The ordinary positive Weyl chamber CR (∆+ (g, hc )) consisting of dominant
elements of (itc0 + ac0 )∗ is a subset of CC (∆+ (g, hc )). We will use the fact that
the topology on CR coming from this inclusion (that, is the quotient topology
from
                        CR (∆+ (g, hc )) ≃ (itc0 + ac0 )∗ /W (g, hc )
coincides with the subspace topology from the inclusion
                           CR (∆+ (g, hc )) ⊂ (itc0 + ac0 )∗ .

       We now write
(8.1a)                        Z(g) = center of U (g).
The Harish-Chandra isomorphism is
                                                      c
(8.1b)                          Z(g) ≃ S(hc )W (g,h ) .
An infinitesimal character is by definition a homomorphism from Z(g) to the
complex numbers, or equivalently a maximal ideal in Z(g). By analogy with
the notation we are using for representations, the set of infinitesimal characters
is written
(8.1c)                         Π(Z(g)) = Max Z(g).
                 CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                           1127

The isomorphism (8.1b) identifies these infinitesimal characters with W orbits
on h∗ :
(8.1d)             Π(Z(g)) ≃ (hc )∗ /W (g, hc ) ≃ CC (∆+ (g, hc ));
the last equivalence comes from Definition 8.1. We will describe this map a
little more carefully in (8.2) below.
      The set of infinitesimal characters carries a “Fell topology” of its own: the
weakest topology making each of the evaluation maps
(8.2a)          ez : Π(Z(g)) → C,       ez (χ) = χ(z)         (z ∈ Z(g))
continuous. (We use the usual analytic topology on C; if instead we used
the Zariski topology, we would get the restriction to Max Z(g) of the Zariski
topology on Spec Z(g).) We can restate the definition of the topology as follows.
A set U ⊂ Π(Z(g)) is a neighborhood of the element χ0 ∈ U if and only if
there are elements z1 , . . . , zn ∈ Z(g) and positive numbers ε1 , . . . , εn with the
property that U contains
(8.2b)    N (z, ε; χ0 ) = {χ ∈ Π(Z(g)) | |χ(zi ) − χ0 (zi )| < εi   (i = 1, . . . , n)}.
Now Chevalley’s theorem says that Z(g) is isomorphic to a polynomial ring
C[x1 , . . . , xm ]. (The elements x1 , . . . , xm may be thought of as generators of
Z(g); by the Harish-Chandra isomorphism (8.1b), they correspond to genera-
tors for the algebra of W -invariants in S(hc ).) Each element ξ = (ξ1 , . . . , ξm ) ∈
Cm defines an element χξ ∈ Π(Z(g)); the characteristic property is χξ (xi ) = ξi .
By the Nullstellensatz, this correspondence gives an isomorphism
(8.2c)                              Π(Z(g)) ≃ Cm .
It is very easy to check (by the description of neighborhoods in (8.2b)) that this
isomorphism sends the topology on Π(Z(g)) to the standard topology on Cm .
We want to know something slightly more subtle, however. We may identify
S(hc ) with the algebra of polynomial functions on (hc )∗ . Each λ ∈ (hc )∗
therefore defines an algebra homomorphism
(8.2d)                     ξλ : S(hc ) → C,      p 7→ p(λ).
We use the same symbol to denote the composition with the Harish-Chandra
homomorphism:
(8.2e)                              ξλ : Z(g) → C.
In this way we get a map
(8.2f)                     (hc )∗ → Π(Z(g)),         λ 7→ ξλ .
This is the map of (8.1d): it is surjective, and the fibers are precisely the orbits
of W (g, hc ).

     It is more or less obvious from the definitions that the map of (8.2f)
is continuous (from the standard topology on (hc )∗ to the “Fell topology”
on Π(Z(g))). What we need is the stronger assertion that the topology on
Π(Z(g)) is actually the quotient topology; equivalently, that the map (8.2f) is
open. Here is an explicit formulation.

     Lemma 8.2. In the setting of (8.2), suppose (p1 , . . . , pm ) is a collection
                              c
of generators for S(hc )W (g,h ) . Fix λ0 ∈ (hc )∗ and ε > 0. Then there is a
positive number δ so that if λ ∈ (hc )∗ and
                         |pi (λ) − pi (λ0 )| < δ    (i = 1, . . . , m),
then there is a w ∈ W (g, hc ) such that
                                      |λ − w · λ0 | < ε.

     In the case of GL(n), this lemma in turn can be reformulated as follows.
Suppose f0 is a monic polynomial of degree n with roots (λ10 , . . . , λn0 ), and
ε > 0. Then there is a δ > 0 so that if f is a monic polynomial whose
coefficients are within δ of those of f0 , then the roots (λ1 , . . . , λn ) of f are
each (after permutation) within ε of the corresponding roots of f0 . That is,
it says that the collection of roots of a polynomial depends continuously on
the coefficients. This is of course well known. In keeping with the incomplete
nature of this section, we omit the argument for the general case.

     Corollary 8.3. The bijection of (8.1d) is a homeomorphism from the
“Fell topology” to the quotient topology from (hc )∗ .

       Definition 8.3.     The infinitesimal character map
                            Πu (G) → Π(Z(g)),          π 7→ ξ(π)
sends an irreducible unitary representation π to the homomorphism ξ(π) by
which Z(g) acts on the space of smooth vectors of π.

     Theorem 8.5 (Bernat-Dixmier [1]).       The infinitesimal character map
is continuous from the Fell topology on the unitary dual to the “Fell topology”
on Π(Z(g)) (cf. (8.2)).

       Corollary 8.6.         The map
                         Πu (G) → CC (∆+ ),         π 7→ φ(π; ∆+ )
(obtained by composing the infinitesimal character map of Theorem 8.5 with
the isomorphisms of (8.1d)) is continuous from the Fell topology on the unitary
dual to the quotient topology (Definition 8.1) on the cone of complex dominant
weights.
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                       1129

     This is immediate from Theorem 8.5 and Corollary 8.3.
     We are now in a position to draw some conclusions about the topology of
the unitary dual. A little more notation is helpful. In the setting of Definition
8.1, suppose λ ∈ i(tc0 )∗ . Define D∆+ (λ) to be the unique W (g, tc ) conjugate
of λ belonging to the positive Weyl chamber C of (0.5c). (Notice that C is
contained in CR (∆+ ).) The map
(8.3a)                      i(tc0 )∗ → C,         λ 7→ D∆+ (λ)
is continuous and finite-to-one. On the other hand, the canonical real part
(Definition 5.6) defines a continuous map
(8.3b)                (hc )∗ → i(tc0 )∗ + (ac0 )∗ ,          φ 7→ RE φ.
This map is W -equivariant, and therefore descends to a continuous map for
the quotient topologies
(8.3c)                  CC (∆+ ) → CR (∆+ ),                 φ 7→ RE φ.
Similarly, the map Tρ of Proposition 1.4 is continuous:
(8.3d)           i(tc0 )∗ + (ac0 )∗ → i(tc0 )∗ + (ac0 )∗ ,       φ 7→ Tρ (φ).
To see this, recall that Tρ is defined separately on each closed Weyl chamber
C ′ : if ρ′ is half the sum of the positive roots for C ′ , and P ′ is the projection
on C ′ (Definition 1.2), then
(8.3e)                             Tρ (φ) = P ′ (φ − ρ′ ).
This mapping is obviously continuous on C ′ , because P ′ is a contraction. Since
C ′ is closed, and the definitions agree on the intersections of different chambers
(Proposition 1.4), Tρ is continous.
    Theorem 8.6.        In the setting of Definition 8.1, suppose π is an irre-
ducible unitary representation, and
                             φ(π; ∆+ ) ∈ CC (∆+ ) ⊂ (hc )∗
comes from the infinitesimal character as in Corollary 8.6. Define
                            λ(π; ∆+ ) = Tρ (RE φ(π; ∆+ ))
(notation as in Proposition 1.4).
 a) The weight λ(π; ∆+ ) belongs to the positive Weyl chamber CR (∆+ ) ⊂
    i(tc0 )∗ + (ac0 )∗ .
 b) The map
                         Πu (G) → CR (∆+ ), π 7→ λ(π; ∆+ )
     is continuous from the Fell topology to the standard topology on the cone
     of dominant weights.

 c) Assume that Conjecture 5.7 holds, and that π ∈ Πλuu (G) (Definition 0.2).
    Then
                            D∆+ (λu ) = λ(π; ∆+ )
       (notation as in (8.3a)).

     Proof. Because RE φ(π; ∆+ ) is dominant for ∆+ (g, hc ), Tρ may be com-
puted by subtracting ρ and projecting on the positive Weyl chamber. This
proves (a). Part (b) follows from Corollary 8.6, the continuity of the maps
in (8.3c and d), and the identification noted in Definition 8.1 of the quotient
and subspace topologies on CR (∆+ ). Part (c) is a reformulation of Theorem
5.8(c).

        Corollary 8.8.             Fix λu ∈ Λu (cf. (0.5e)). Choose representatives
λ1u , . . . , λru for the orbits of R(G) on
                                  W (g, tc ) · λu ∩ Λu .
Assume that Conjecture 5.7 holds.
             S      λi
 a) The set ri=1 Πuu (G) of unitary representations is open and closed in the
    Fell topology.
                                                                        j
                             λi
 b) Suppose i 6= j, and π ∈ Πuu (G). Then π contains no K-types in Buλu (G).
                λi
 c) Each set Πuu (G) is open and closed in the Fell topology.
 d) The mapping
                       Πu (G) → Λu /R(G),      π 7→ λu (π)
       (notation as in Definition 0.2) is continuous from the Fell topology to the
       natural (discrete) topology on the image.

     The statement of this corollary is a little cumbersome; part (c), for ex-
ample, is obviously stronger than (a). The formulation is chosen to make the
proof clearer.
     One might expect that (d) should be more or less a formal consequence
of the definitions. To see why it is not, consider the analogous map
(8.4)                   Πu (G) → Λa /R(G),           π 7→ λa (π)
(notation as in (2.1) and Definition 2.5). The definition of λa is formally very
similar to that of λu ; but the mapping in (8.4) is not continuous in the Fell
topology. To see why, suppose G = SL(2, R), and let π be the first holomorphic
discrete series representation. In the notation of Example 6.2, the lowest K-
type of π is µ2 , and λa (π) = 1. But there is a sequence {πj } of spherical
complementary series representations having π as a limit point. (The reason
is that π appears as a composition factor in the reducible spherical principal
series representation at the end of the complementary series.) Each πj has
                CLASSIFICATION OF UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS                     1131

lowest K-type µ0 , so λa (πj ) = 0. So λa (πj ) fails to converge to λa (π). (On
the other hand, Example 6.2 shows that λu (π) = 0 = λu (πj ), so there is no
contradiction to (d) in the corollary.)

    Proof. By Theorem 8.6(c), we have a continuous map
            Πu (G) → D∆+ (Λu ),       π 7→ λ(π, ∆+ ) = D∆+ (λu (π)).
The range is discrete because Λu is (cf. (0.5e)), and so carries the discrete
topology. The set of unitary representations in (a) is just the preimage of
D∆+ (λu ), and so must be open and closed. Part (b) is immediate from Lemma
5.5.
                                               λi
      For (c), it suffices to prove that each Πuu (G) is closed. So suppose {πn }
                                       λi
is a sequence of representations in Πuu (G), and that π is a limit point. By (a),
                           j
π must belong to some Πλuu (G); we want to show that i = j. Suppose not. By
                                                    j
Definition 0.2, π must contain a K-type τ in Buλu (G). We can therefore form
a corresponding nonzero matrix coefficient fπ ; it transforms on the right and
left by τ under K. By the definition of the Fell topology, fπ may be uniformly
approximated on compact sets by matrix coefficients of the representations πn .
By (b), these representations do not contain τ ; and it follows easily that their
matrix coefficients cannot approximate fπ . This contradiction proves (c). Part
(d) is immediate from (c).

     Corollary 8.9. In the setting of Theorem 5.8, assume that Conjecture
5.7 holds. Then the bijection

                        LSu (λu ): Πλuu (G(λu )) → Πλuu (G)
is a homeomorphism in the Fell topology; the image is open and closed in
Πu (G).

     Sketch of proof. According to fundamental (and partly unpublished) work
of Miličić, the Fell topology may be described in terms of the reducibility
of certain parabolically induced representations. To be a little more precise,
suppose P = M AN is a parabolic subgroup of G, δ ∈ Πa (M ) is an admissible
representation, and

(8.5a)                            ν: [0, 1] → a∗
is a continuous map. Define a family of admissible representations by
(8.5b)             I(t) = IndG
                             P (δ ⊗ ν(t) ⊗ 1),      (t ∈ [0, 1]).

Now we make the following assumption:
(8.5c)   For all t ∈ [0, 1), the representation I(t) is irreducible and unitary.
1132           SUSANA A. SALAMANCA-RIBA AND DAVID A. VOGAN, JR.


Here by “unitary” we mean “infinitesimally equivalent to a unitary represen-
tation.” List the irreducible composition factors of the representation I(1) as
I1 , I2 , . . . , Ir . As a consequence of assumption 8.5(c) and a theorem of Miličić,
(see [11]), all of the representations Ij are unitary; and they are precisely the
limit points of I(t) as t approaches 1:

(8.5d)                         lim I(t) = {I1 , . . . , Ir }.
                               t→1

Finally, every convergent sequence in the Fell topology has a subsequence con-
structed in this way.
     By this description of the Fell topology, and the good behavior of LSu (λu )
(in particular Theorem 5.4(e)), it is not difficult to prove the corollary. We
omit the details.

     We make one final remark. All of the interesting results in this section
depend on Conjecture 5.7; it is natural to ask what can be said absolutely. In
the setting of Theorems 5.4 and 5.8, we can consider a certain subset

(8.6a)                     Πλu,good
                              u
                                    (G(λu )) ⊂ Πλuu (G(λu ))

consisting of unitary representations for which the infinitesimal character φ(Z)
satisfies

(8.6b)                RE φ(Z) ∈ λu + {convex hull of W · ρ};

here both the Weyl group and ρ come from G(λu ). The content of Conjecture
5.7 is that this set is all of Πλuu (G(λu )); but in any case it is a well-defined closed
subset. The proof of Theorem 5.8 shows that LSu (λu ) defines a bijection from
this set to a closed subset

(8.6c)                          Πλu,good
                                   u
                                         (G) ⊂ Πλuu (G).

We define

(8.6d)                      Πu,good = ∪λu ∈Λu Πλu,good
                                                 u
                                                       (G),

a closed subset of Πu (G). Everything we have said about Πu (G) using Con-
jecture 5.7 applies unconditionally to Πu,good (G).
