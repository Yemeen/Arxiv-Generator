                                                              The lassifying spae of a bound quiver
                                                                             Juan Carlos Bustamante
                                                      Abstrat.    We assoiate to a bound quiver (Q, I) a CW-omplex whih we
                                                      denote by B(Q, I), and all the lassifying spae of (Q, I). We show that
                                                      the fundamental group of B(Q, I) is isomorphi to the fundamental group of
                                                      (Q, I). Moreover, we show that this onstrution behaves well with respet to
                                                      overings. On the other hand, we study the (o)homology groups of B(Q, I),
                                                      and ompare them with the simpliial and the Hohshild (o)homology groups
                                                      of the algebra A = kQ/I . More preisely, we give suient onditions for these
                                                      groups to be isomorphi. This generalizes a theorem due to Gerstenhaber and
                                                      Shak [20℄.




                                                                                    Introdution
                                                  Let A be an assoiative, nite dimensional algebra over an algebraially losed
                                             eld k. It is well-known (see [8℄, for instane) that if A is basi and onneted, then
                                             there exists a onneted bound quiver (Q, I) suh that A ≃ kQ/I , where kQ is the
                                             path algebra of Q and I is an admissible two sided ideal of kQ. The pair (Q, I) is
                                             then alled a presentation of A. If Q ontains no oriented yles, then A is said
                                             to be a triangular k−algebra.
                                                  For eah presentation (Q, I) of A, one an dene its fundamental group,
                                             denoted by π1 (Q, I) (see [21, 25℄, for instane). A triangular k−algebra A is said
                                             to be simply onneted if, for every presentation (Q, I) of A, the group π1 (Q, I)
                                             is trivial. Simply onneted algebras play an important rle in the representation
                                             theory of algebras, sine overing tehniques often allow to redue the study of
                                             indeomposable representations of an algebra A to the study of indeomposable
                                             representations of a suitably hoosen simply onneted algebra [8℄.
                                                  On the other hand, given an algebra A = kQ/I , its Hohshild ohomology
                                             groups HHi (A) also give important information about the simple onnetedness, as
                                             well as about the rigidity properties of A, see [19, 13, 33℄. If moreover A admits
                                             a semi-normed basis, one an dene the simpliial homology and ohomology

                                             SHi (A, G), respetively see [9℄ (also [26, 24℄).
                                                  Results in [2, 9, 10, 15, 20, 23℄ exhibit several relations between the groups
                                             mentioned above. To a shurian triangular algebra A is assoiated a simpliial

and the simpliial (o)homology groups of A are respetively isomorphi to the
fundamental group and the (o)homology groups of |A| see [10, 24, 9℄.
    The main aim of this work is to build a topologial spae whih would be a
geometrial model for studying the fundamental groups and overings of bound
quivers, as well as the simpliial and Hohshild (o)homology of not neessarily
shurian algebras. The paper is organized as follows.
    In setion 1, we x notation and terminology, and reall the denition of the
(natural) homotopy relation indued by an ideal I on the set of walks in a quiver
Q. We also reall the denition of the fundamental group π1 (Q, I).
    We begin setion 2 with a motivating disussion about lassifying spaes of
small ategories, in the sense of K−theory [32, 28℄. A partiular ase of that
onstrution is the simpliial omplex |A| assoiated to an inidene algebra A(Σ).
The main part of this setion is devoted to the onstrution of a CW-omplex
B = B(Q, I), whih we all the lassifying spae of the bound quiver (Q, I).
Several examples are given.
    In setion 3, we disuss some homotopy properties of B , and we prove the rst
main result of this paper.
    Theorem 3.3. Let (Q, I) be a bound quiver, and B = B(Q, I) be its lassifying
spae. Then the groups π1 (B) and π1 (Q, I) are isomorphi.
    This generalizes previous similar results obtained independently for inidene
algebras, and for shurian triangular algebras in [30℄ and [10℄, respetively. More-
over, this allows to obtain an adaptation of Van Kampen's theorem to the ontext
of bound quivers (ompare with [30℄).
    In setion 4, we deal with overings of bound quivers, and of topologial spaes.
Theorem 4.3 says that a overing morphism of bound quivers p : (Q̂, I)    ˆ    / (Q, I)
indues a overing of topologial spaes Bp : B(Q̂, I)
                                                    ˆ     / B(Q, I) . The main result
in this setion is the following:
    Theorem 4.5. Let               / (Q, I) be a Galois overing given by a group
                                   ˆ
                          p : (Q̂, I)
G. Then (B̂, Bp) is a regular overing of B with overing automorphism group
isomorphi to G.
   In setion 5, we reall the denition of the simpliial (o)homology of an algebra
A = kQ/I having a semi-normed basis. We show that the homotopy relation is
strongly related to the vetors of suh a basis. Finally, we ompare the simpliial
homology and ohomology groups of A to the (ellular) homology and ohomology
groups of B(Q, I) with oeients in some abelian group G, Hi (B) and Hi (B, G),
respetively. More preisely, we show the following statement
   Corollary 5.5. Let A = kQ/I be an algebra having a semi-normed basis.
Then, for eah i ≥ 0, there are isomorphisms of abelian groups
                                           ∼
                              SHi (A, G)       / Hi (B, G),
                                           ∼    / Hi (B).
                               SHi (A)

    An immediate onsequene of this result is that one an think about the
(o)homology theories of B(Q, I) as a generalization of the simpliial (o)homology

theories of an algebra A, whih are dened only for algebras having semi-normed
bases.
    Finally, in setion 6 we fous on the Hohshild ohomology groups of A.
More preisely, following [20, 24℄ we ompare them with the simpliial ohomology
groups of A. Strengthening theorem 3 in [24℄, we then prove the following result,
whih generalizes a theorem due to Gerstenhaber and Shak [20℄ (see also [12℄).
    Theorem 6.3. Let A = kQ/I be a shurian triangular, semi-ommutative
algebra. Then, for eah i ≥ 0, there is an isomorphism of abelian groups
                                                  ∼
                         Hi (ǫ) : SHi (A, k + )       / HHi (A) .


    It is worth to note that the isomorphisms of Corollary 5.5 and Theorem 6.3
are indued by isomorphisms of omplexes whih preserve anonial up-produts,
thus the isomorphism above yields an isomorphism of graded rings. We use them
to obtain new algebrai-topology avored proofs of some known results about the
Hohshild ohomology groups of monomial algebras ([4, 22℄).
                          1. Preliminaries
    1.1. Notation and terminology. Let Q be a nite quiver. We denote by
Q0 and Q1 the sets of verties and arrows of Q, respetively. Given a ommutative
eld k, the path algebra kQ is the k-vetor spae with basis all the paths of Q,
inluding one stationary path ex for eah vertex x of Q. Two paths sharing soure
and target are said to be parallel. The multipliation of two basis elements of kQ
is their omposition whenever it is possible, and 0 otherwise. Let F be the two-
sided ideal of kQ generated by the arrows of Q. A two-sided ideal I of kQ is alled
admissible if there exists an integer m ≥ 2 suh that F m ⊆ I ⊆ F 2 . The pair
(Q, I) is a bound quiver. It is well-known that if A is a basi, onneted, nite
dimensional algebra over an algebraially losed eld k, then there exists a unique
nite onneted quiver Q and a surjetive morphism of k−algebras ν : kQ / A ,
whih is not unique in general, with I = Ker ν admissible [8℄.
     Let (Q, I) be a bound quiver, and A ≃ kQ/I . It will sometimes be onvenient to
onsider A as a loally bounded k−ategory, whose objet lass is Q0 , and, for x, y
in Q0 , the morphism set A(x, y) equals the quotient of the free k−module kQ(x, y)
with basis the set of paths from x to y , modulo the subspae I(x, y) = I ∩ kQ(x, y),
see [8℄. A path w from x to y is said to be a non-zero path if w ∈/ I(x, y). It is
easily seen that A(x, y) = ex Aey .
    1.2. The fundamental group. Given a bound quiver (Q,P          I), its fundamental
group is dened as follows [25℄. For x, y in Q0 , a relation ρ = m  i=1 λi wi ∈ I(x, y)
(where λi ∈ k∗ , and wi are dierent paths from x to y ) is said P  to  be minimal if
m ≥ 2, and, for every proper subset J of {1, . . . , n}, we have J λi wi ∈  / I(x, y).
    We dene the homotopy relation ∼ on the set of walks on (Q, I), as the
smallest equivalene relation satisfying
     (1) For eah arrow α from x to P  y , one has αα−1 ∼ ex and α−1 α ∼ ey .
     (2) For eah minimal relation m       i=1 λi wi , one has wi ∼ wj for all i, j in
          {1, . . . , m}.
     (3) If u, v, w and w′ are walks, and u ∼ v then wuw′ ∼ wvw′ , whenever these
          ompositions are dened.

    We denote by we the homotopy lass of a walk w. A losely related notion is
that of natural homotopy. Two parallel paths p and q are said to be naturally
homotopi if p = q or there exists a sequene p = p0 , p1 , . . . , ps = q of parallel
paths, and, for i ∈ {1, . . . , s}, paths ui , vi , vi′ and wi suh that pi = ui vi wi ,
pi+1 = ui vi′ wi with vi and vi′ appearing in the same minimal relation (ompare
with [3℄). In that ase we write p ∼◦ q and pe◦ will denote the natural homotopy
lass of a path p. It is easily seen that natural homotopy is the smallest equivalene
relation on the set of paths on (Q, I) satisfying onditions 2) and 3) (replaing, of
ourse, walks by paths in ondition 3)). Thus p ∼◦ q implies p ∼ q but the onverse
is not true (see 2.2, example 1)). Sine the ideal I is admissible, for every arrow
α in Q one has α  e◦ = {α}. Moreover, note that if A = kQ/I is shurian, then the
relations ∼ and ∼◦ oinide.
    For a xed vertex x0 ∈ Q0 , we denote by π1 (Q, x0 ) the fundamental group of
the underlying graph of Q at the vertex x0 . Let N (Q, I, x0 ) be the normal subgroup
of π1 (Q, x0 ) generated by all elements of the form w−1 u−1 vw, where w is a walk
from x0 to x, and u, v are two homotopi paths from x to y . The fundamental
group π1 (Q, I) is dened to be

                          π1 (Q, I) = π1 (Q, x0 )/N (Q, I, x0 ).

     Sine the quiver Q is onneted, this denition is independent of the hoie of
the base point x0 . An important remark is that the group dened above depends
essentially on the minimal relations, whih are given by the ideal. It is well-known
that, for a k-algebra A, its presentation as a bound quiver algebra is not unique.
Thus, the fundamental group is not an invariant of the algebra (see [1℄). A tri-
angular k-algebra A is said to be simply onneted if, for every presentation
A ≃ kQ/I of A as a bound quiver algebra, we have π1 (Q, I) = 1.
     However, it has been shown in [5℄ that if an algebra A is onstrited (that is, if,
for every arrow α : x / y in Q1 , one has dimk A(x, y) = 1), then the fundamental
group is independent of the presentation.

                       2. The lassifying spae B(Q, I)
    2.1. Bakground and motivation. To a shurian triangular algebra A =
kQ/I , is assoiated a simpliial omplex |A| in the following way [9℄ (see also
[26, 7℄): An n−simplex is a sequene x0 , x1 , . . . , xn of n + 1 dierent verties of Q
suh that for eah j with 1 ≤ j ≤ n, there is a morphism fj in A(xj−1 , xj ) with
fn fn−1 · · · f1 6= 0. For instane, if A = A(Σ) is the inidene algebra of a poset
(Σ, ≤), then |A| is the simpliial omplex of non empty hains of Σ (see [6, 20℄).
Moreover, in this ase, this onstrution is a partiular ase of that of the lassifying
spae BC of a small ategory C (see [32, 28℄). More generally, let C be a small
ategory. The spae BC is a CW-omplex with 0−ells orresponding to the objets
of C , and, for n ≥ 1, one n−ell for eah diagram

                                f1          f2           fn
                           X0        / X1        / ···        / Xn
in C where none of the fi is an identity map. The orresponding n−ell is attahed
in the obvious way to any ell of smaller dimension obtained by deleting some Xi
and, if 0 < i < n, replaing fi and fi+1 by the omposition fi+1 fi , whenever this

omposition is not an identity map. This onstrution leads to a funtor from the
ategory of small ategories to that of CW-omplexes.
     For example, onsider a poset (Σ, ≤) as a ategory whose objets are the ele-
ments of Σ, and, for x, y ∈ Σ there is a morphism ρyx : y / x if and only if x ≤ y in
Σ, with the obvious omposition. With the above notation, the simpliial omplex
|Σ| is equal to BΣ. This leads us to the following.

     2.2. Denition and Examples. Reall that, given                           Pn n ≥ 0, the standard
n−simplex is the set ∆n = {(t0 , t1 , . . . , tn ) ∈ Rn+1 |                       i=0 ti = 1, ti ≥ 0}. Its
j th fae is ∂j ∆n = {(t0 , t1 , . . . , tn ) ∈ ∆n | tj = 0}, and, moreover ∂∆n = ∪j ∂j ∆n .
An open n−ell is an homeomorphi opy of ∆n \∂∆n . Given two topologial spaes

     We wish to build a CW-omplex by suessively attahing n−ells to a previ-
ously built (n − 1)−dimensional omplex. We begin by giving a desription of the
sets Cn of n−ells. Set C0 = Q0 , C1 = {e                   σ ◦ | σ : x /o / y is a path in Q, σ ∈              / I, σ 6=
ei }, and, for n ≥ 2, Cn = {(e                           en◦ )| σ1 σ2 · · · σn is a path in Q, σ1 · · · σn ∈
                                           σ1◦ , . . . , σ                                                                 /
I, σi 6= ei }. To avoid umbersome notations, an element (e                        σ1◦ , σ             en◦ ) of Cn will
                                                                                         e2◦ , . . . , σ
be denoted by σ n , or even σ , if there is no risk of onfusion.
     Given σ = σe◦ ∈ C1 , with, say, σ : x /o /o /o / y , dene ∂01 (σ) = y and ∂11 (σ) = x.

    Denition. Let (Q, I) be a bound quiver. The CW-omplex obtained by the
preeding onstrution is the lassifying spae of (Q, I), and is denoted by B(Q, I)
     A slightly dierent approah onsists in onsidering homotopy lasses of paths,
instead of natural homotopy lasses to attah the ells. The omplex obtained in
this way will be denoted B ♯ (Q, I), and alled the total lassifying spae of (Q, I).
    Remarks.
     (1) If the algebra A = kQ/I is almost triangular, that is ex (rad A)ey 6= 0
         implies ey (rad A)ex = 0 for all verties x, y ∈ Q0 (ompare with the
         denition in [10℄), then the spaes B(Q, I) and B ♯ (Q, I) are regular CW-
         omplexes.
     (2) Sine for every arrow α of Q we have that αe◦ = {α}, the underlying graph
         of Q an be onsidered in a natural way as a subspae of the lassifying
         spae B(Q, I). This is not the ase with the total lassifying spae (see
         example 1 below).
    Examples.

         bound by I =< βα − γα >. The arrows β and γ are homotopi, but not
         naturally homotopi. The spaes B(Q, I) and B ♯ (Q, I) look as follows

                         1



                                                                                f

                                                                                     α   1

                        B(Q, I)                                         B ♯(Q, I)


     (2) Let A = kQ/I be a shurian algebra. As noted before, in this ase ho-
         motopy and natural homotopy oinide, thus B(Q, I) = B ♯ (Q, I). For
         x, y ∈ Q0 , there is a 1-ell joining them if and only if there is a non-zero
         path w from, say, x to y . Moreover, if there is another suh path w′ ,
         then, sine A is shurian, one has w ∼◦ w′ . Thus dierent paths give the
         same 1−ell, and one an identify it with the pair (x, y). In a similar way,
         given an n−ell orresponding to (e                 en◦ ), with σi ∈ A(xi−1 , xi ), one
                                               σ1◦ , . . . , σ
         an identify it with the sequene of n + 1 points x0 , x1 , . . . , xn in Q. This
         shows that for shurian algebras A = kQ/I , the ellular omplex B(Q, I)
         is preisely the simpliial omplex |A| of 2.1, above (see also [24℄).

    latter is not zero. Moreover, in this ase we have B(Q, I) = B ♯ (Q, I).
(4) Let Q be a quiver, and I be the ideal of kQ generated by paths of length 2.
    In this ase there are no minimal relations, so homotopy, and natural ho-
    motopy are trivial relations so B(Q, I) = B ♯ (Q, I). Eah arrow α : x / y
    of Q gives rise to a 1−ell. Moreover, sine the only non-zero paths are
    the arrows, these are the only ells. For the same reason, there are no
    higher dimensional ells, so the spae B(Q, I) is homeomorphi to Q, the
    underlying graph of Q.

        with n−tuples (e                 en◦ ) of omposable morphisms, regardless whether
                           σ1◦ , . . . , σ
        their omposition is zero or not. However, if there are no monomial rela-
        tions in I , the omplex B(Q, I) is exatly the lassifying spae B(P(Q, I)).
        The same applies for B ♯ (Q, I) with respet to the lassifying spae of the
        ategory P(Q)/ ∼.

        bound by all the ommutativity relations and all the paths of length 3.
        The spae B(Q, I) is homeomorphi to the 3−dimensional sphere S 2 . The
        ommutativity relations tell how to "glue" the 2−dimensional ells. The
        existene of monomial relations implies that there are no 3−ells to "ll
        the hole". On the other hand, the spae B(P(Q, I)) is homeomorphi to
        the ball B 3 .
            Let (Q, I ′ ) be the same quiver bound by the ommutativity relations
        (and only these). In partiular, the natural homotopy relations indued
        by I and I ′ are the same. However, the spae B(Q, I ′) is homeomorphi
        to B 3 , hene does not have the same homotopy type as B(Q, I). This
        shows that monomial relations play an important rle in the onstrution
        of B(Q, I), even though they are taken into aount to dene the neither
        the natural homotopy nor the homotopy relations.
    (3) The fat that B(Q, I) is not really the lassifying spae of a ategory
        implies that this onstrution is not funtorial, as the following example
        shows: Consider the quiver Q

        and let I =< α1 α2 + β1 β2 >, I ′ =< α1 α2 , β1 β2 >. The identity map
        on Q yields a bound quiver morphism f : (Q, I) / (Q, I ′ ) . However the
        indued map g : (Q, I ′ ) / (Q, I) is not a bound quiver morphism sine
        α1 α2 ∈ I ′ , but α1 α2 ∈
                                / I . In this ase, the spae B(Q, I) is homeomorphi
        to B 2 = {x ∈ R2 | ||x|| ≤ 1}. On the other hand, B(Q, I ′) is homeomorphi
        to S 1 . Thus, there is no non homotopially trivial map from B(Q, I) to
        B(Q, I ′ )

                                        3. Homotopy
      3.1. Proposition. Let (Q, I) be a bound quiver with I a monomial ideal suh
that = kQ/I is almost triangular. Then the underlying graph Q is a deformation
retrat of B(Q, I).
Proof : Sine I is monomial, the natural homotopy and the homotopy relations
are trivial. Thus, the n−ells are given by n−tuples (σ1 , . . . , σn ) of paths suh
that σ1 σ2 · · · σn ∈/ I . If I = F 2 , there is nothing to prove (see example 4, above).
If this is not the ase, then there are non-zero paths of length greater or equal
than 2. Let α1 · · · αn be a maximal non-zero path. It gives a n−ell α whih is
maximal. For i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, let xi be the soure of αi+1 , and xn be the target
of αn . Sine A is almost triangular, xi 6= xj whenever i 6= j , thus we may onsider
the n−ell α as the standard n−simplex [x0 , . . . xn ]. Let y = 12 (x0 + xn ), thus
[x0 , . . . xn ] = [x0 , . . . , xn−1 , y] ∪ [y, x1 , ..., xn ].

              x0                           x0                        x0

                              x3                        x3                        x3


       x2                          x2                          x2
                                                    1

      For t ∈ [0, 1] dene r(t) = (1 − t)y + tx1 , that is the path joining y to x1 .
Using r one an "rush" the simplex [x0 , . . . xn ] onto its faes [x0 , . . . , xn−1 ] and
[x1 , . . . , xn ], whih, by the maximality assumption, are the only faes in the omplex
that are not free (use the baryentri oordinates, and the division of the simplex
given below). The spae obtained is B(Q, I), in whih we have rushed the ell
α onto the (n − 1)−ells ∂0 (α) and ∂n (α). It is easily seen that this spae is
preisely B(Q, I1 ) where I1 = I+ < α1 · · · αn >, whih is again a monomial ideal.
If I1 = F 2 , we have nished, otherwise we repeat the proess above with another
maximal dimensional ell of B(Q, I1 ). This must end in a nite number of steps,
sine I is admissible.
                                                                                         
     A rst immediate onsequene is that if I is a monomial ideal, then the fun-
damental group π1 (B) of the topologial spae B , is isomorphi to the fundamental
group π1 (Q, I) of the bound quiver (Q, I). In fat, this is a partiular ase of a
muh more general situation.
     Given a ell omplex X , its fundamental group π1 (X) an be desribed in the
following onvenient way (see [27℄, for instane). Fix a 0−ell, x0 , and a maximal
tree M , that is, a subomplex of dimension smaller or equal than 1, whih is ayli
and maximal with respet to this property. For every 2−ell e2λ of X , let αe be
a path lass whih starts at some xed 0−ell x in its boundary, ∂e2λ, and goes
around ∂e2λ exatly one. Moreover, let βx be the unique path lass in X whih
goes from x0 to x along the tree M . Finally set γe = βx αe βx−1 (ompare with the
denition of a parade data in [17℄).

subgroup of G generated by the following elements
       (1) The ells of M ,
       (2) The elements γe , as onstruted above.
      With the above notation, reformulating theorem 2.1, p 213 of [27℄, one has
π1 (X) ≃ G/N .
      Moreover, sine we are interested in omplexes of the form B = B(Q, I), and in
this ase all the 2−ells are of the form (e      e2◦ ), the boundary of suh a ell being

    3.2. Lemma. Let (Q, I) be a bound quiver and T be a maximal tree in Q.
Then π1 (B) ≃ F/K , where F is the free group with basis the set of arrows of Q,
and K is the normal subgroup of F generated by the elements of the following two
types:
      (1) α, for every arrow α in T
      (2) (α1 α2 · · · αr )(β1 β2 · · · βs )−1 whenever α1 α2 · · · αr and β1 β2 · · · βs are two
          paths appearing in the same minimal relation.
Proof : Let        T be a maximal tree in the quiver Q. In partiular T is a set of
arrows of Q. It follows from the onstrution of B(Q, I) that an arrow α : x / y in
T gives rise to a 1−ell α  e◦ in B(Q, I). The set of 1−ells obtained from the arrows
of T forms a maximal tree M in B(Q, I). We work with respet to these maximal
trees. Moreover, let G and N be as before.
    Consider the map φ : F / G/N dened by α  / α̃N . It is straightforward
to see that K ⊆ Ker φ, so we obtain a group homomorphism Φ : F/K / G/N
dened by αK  / α̃N
    We show that Φ is an isomorphism by onstruting its inverse. If we◦ is a 1− ell
in B(Q, I), then there are arrows α1 , α2 , . . . , αr in Q suh that α1 α2 · · · αr ∼◦ w,
and α1 α2 · · · αr ∈/ I . Dene the map ψ : G / F/K by w̃  / α1 α2 · · · αr K . It
is not hard to see that this is a well-dened map, and, moreover, that N ⊆
Ker ψ . Thus, we obtain a group homomorphism Ψ : G/N                   / F/K dened by
          α1 . . . αr K . Finally, it is straightforward to hek that Φ and Ψ are mu-

   3.3. Theorem. Let (Q, I) be a bound quiver, with Q triangular and B =
B(Q, I). Then the groups π1 (B) and π1 (Q, I) are isomorphi.
Proof : This is an easy onsequene of the preeding lemma, and the desription
of π1 (Q, I) given in setion 1.2.
                                                                                              

     Remark. A similar argument applies to the fundamental group of                   B ♯ (Q, I).
Thus we obtain π1 (B ) ≃ π1 (Q, I).

     3.4. Corollary. Let A = kQ/I be a triangular algebra. Then A is simply on-
neted if and only if for every presentation (Q, I), B(Q, I) or, equivalently B ♯ (Q, I),

    Given a bound quiver (Q, I), and a full onvex subquiver Qi , let I i denote the
ideal I ∩ kQi of kQi , that is, the restrition of I to Qi . With these notations we
have the following result (see also [30℄).
    3.5. Corollary. Let    (Q, I) be a bound quiver, Q1 and Q2 be two full onvex
subquivers of Q suh that every non-zero path of Q lies entirely in either Q1 or Q2 ,
and Q0 = Q1 ∩ Q2 is onneted. Then, π1 (Q, I) is the pushout of the diagram
                     π1 (Q1 , I 1 ) o           π1 (Q0 , I 0 )                  / π1 (Q2 , I 2 )

where the arrows are the maps indued by the inlusions.
Proof : It follows from the hypotheses made on                                  Q1 and Q2 , that B(Q1 , I 1 ) ∪
B(Q , I ) = B(Q, I), and that B(Q , I ) ∩ B(Q , I ) is onneted. The result then

bound by I =< α1 α2 − β1 β2 , α1 β2 − β1 α2 >, and let Q1 and Q2 be the full
subquivers of Q generated be the verties 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 1, 2, 3, respetively. An
easy omputation gives π1 (Q1 , I 1 ) = Z ∗ Z, π1 (Q2 , I 2 ) = Z2 , and π1 (Q0 , I 0 ) = Z,
and this yields π1 (Q, I) = Z ∗ Z2 .

                                            4. Coverings
    As we saw in the example before proposition 3.1, the onstrution of B(Q, I)
does not lead to a funtor from the ategory of bound quivers with bound quivers
morphisms to the ategory of CW-omplexes with ellular maps. However, as we
now see, if we onsider the ategory of bound quivers with overing morphisms,
then B gives rise to a overing morphism of topologial spaes.
     We refer the reader to [8, 18, 14℄, for referenes about overings and their uses
in representation theory of algebras.
     Given a bound quiver Q and a vertex x ∈ Q0 , let, as usual, x+ (or x− ) be the set
of all arrows leaving (or entering, respetively) the vertex x. A bound quiver mor-
phism p : (Q,b I)
               b     / (Q, I) indues in an obvious way a k−linear map p : k Q
                                                                             b      / kQ .

is alled a overing morphism if
      (1) p−1 (x) 6= ∅ for every x ∈ Q0
      (2) For every x ∈ Q0 , and x̂ ∈ p−1 (x), the map p indues bijetions x̂+ / x+
           and x̂− / x−

     (3) For every x, y ∈ Q0 , every relation ρ ∈ I(x, y) and every x̂ ∈ p−1 (x) there
         exists ŷ ∈ p−1 (y) and ρ̂ ∈ I(x̂,

    Conditions 2) and 3) ensure that overing morphisms behave well with respet
to homotopy relations. We have the following straightforward lemmata whose easy
proofs will be omitted.

    Reall from [31℄, for instane, that if X is a topologial spae, then a overing
spae of X is a pair (X̂, p) where
      (1) X̂ is an arwise onneted topologial spae
      (2) p : X̂ / X is a ontinuous map

          with Ûi disjoint open sets, and p|Û : Ûi / Ux an homeomorphism, for
          every i ∈ I .
     This yields the following result.
     4.3. Theorem. Let p : (Q, b
                            b I)           / (Q, I) be a overing morphism of bound quiv-
ers, with Q, Q
             b onneted. Then (B̂, Bp) is a overing spae of B(Q, I)

Proof : Sine Q̂ is a onneted quiver, Bb is an arwise onneted spae. Moreover,
it follows from its denition that Bp is a ontinuous map. Thus, there only remains
to prove that the third ondition of the denition is satised. But this follows from
the fat that the open ells of Bb are disjoint open sets, and from the denition of
Bp, whose restrition the eah suh ell is an homeomorphism.
                                                                                            
     Among all the overs of a bound quiver (Q, I), there is one of partiular interest.
The universal over of (Q, I) is a over map p : (Q̂, I)

     Reall from [14℄, for instane, that a over of bound quivers p : (Q̂, I)ˆ         / (Q, I)
is said to be a Galois over dened by the ation of a group G of automorphisms
of (Q̂, I)
        ˆ if
      (4) pg = p for all g ∈ G
      (5) p−1 (x) = Gp−1 (x) and p−1 (α) = Gp−1 (α), for all verties x in Q0 and
           arrows α ∈ Q1 .
      (6) G ats without xed points on Q̂.
     Moreover, in this situation there exists a normal subgroup H of π1 (Q, I) suh
              ˆ ≃ H and π1 (Q, I)/H ≃ G (see [14℄).
that π1 (Q̂, I)
     As before, an automorphism g of (Q̂, I)   ˆ indues a map from the set of paths of
     ˆ to the set of paths of (Q, I). This allows to dene a ellular map Bg : B̂
(Q̂, I)                                                                                       /B

                                                                       σ1 , . . . , σ ◦

the ell (g    ◦
                           σn ). The fat that Bg is well-dened follows from the fat
           g σ1 , . . . , gg
                             ◦

that g is invertible. Moreover, it is straightforward to hek that BgBp = Bp. An
important remark is that the restrition of Bg to the 0−ells of B̂ is preisely g .
An immediate onsequene of this is that if g1 and g2 are automorphisms of (Q̂, I)             ˆ
with g1 6= g2 , then Bg1 6= Bg2 .
     On the other hand, given a overing spae (X̂, p) of a topologial spae X , we
denote by p∗ the group homomorphism π1 (p) : π1 (X̂) / π1 (X) . In partiular, p∗ is
always a monomorphism (see [31℄). If Im p∗ is a normal subgroup of π1 (X) then the
overing (X̂, p) is said to be regular. The set of all homeomorphisms φ : X̂ / X̂
suh pφ = p is a group, whih is alled the group of overing automorphisms of
(X̂, p), and is denoted by Cov(X̂/X). It is well-known that a overing (X̂, p) is
regular if and only if Cov(X̂/X) ats transitively on p−1 (x0 ), the ber over the
base point (see [31℄, for instane).
     Note that the set {Bg| g ∈ G} is a subgroup of Cov(B̂/B), whih is isomorphi
to G. In fat, we have the following stronger result.
    4.5. Theorem. Let                  / (Q, I) be a Galois overing given by a group
                                       ˆ
                              p : (Q̂, I)
G. Then (B̂, Bp) is a regular overing of B and Cov(B̂/B) ≃ G.
Proof : First of all, x a vertex x0 ∈ Q0, whih is also a 0−ell of B . These will
be the base points with respet the fundamental groups that will be onsidered.
    In order to show that (B̂, Bp) is a regular overing of B , it is enough to show
that Cov(B̂/B) ats transitively on the ber p−1 (x0 ). This follows immediately from
ondition 5 in the denition of a Galois overing, and the fat that G is isomorphi
to a subgroup of Cov(B̂/B).
    On the other hand

                       Cov(B̂/B) ≃                     ≃              ≃G

where the rst isomorphism is given by Corollary 10.28, p. 294 in [31℄
                                                                                             

    Remark. Theorem 10.19, p.290, in [31℄ states that a nontrivial overing au-
tomorphism h ∈ Cov(X̂/X) ats without xed points on X̂ . Thus, ondition 6 in
the denition of Galois overings is redundant.

     Example. Consider the quiver Q
                                          α1         α2
                                               (           (

bound by the ideal I =< α1 α2 − β1 β2 , α1 β2 − β1 α2 >. The spae B(Q, I) is
homeomorphi to the real projetive plane RP 2 . On the other hand, the universal
over of (Q, I) is given by the quiver Q′

                                   x3 B       / x2         / x1

overing map p : Q′ / Q is given by p(xi ) = p(yi ) = i, for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. The spae
     b is homeomorphi to the sphere S 2 , and the map Bp identies antipodal
   b I)
B(Q,
points. It is well-known that the pair (S 2 , Bp) is a overing spae of RP 2 .
    Remark. Again, with the obvious hanges in lemmata 4.1, 4.2 and theorem 4.3
we obtain a similar result for the total lassifying spae B ♯ (Q, I), and its overing
spaes.

                          5. (Co)Homologies
     5.1. (Co)Homology of B(Q, I). Let (C• (B), δ) be the omplex dened by
letting Ci (B) be the free abelian group with basis the set of i−ells, Ci , and
by dening δn : Cn (B) / Cn−1 (B) on the basis elements by the rule δn (σ) =
Pn+1
   i=0 (−1) ∂i (σ).
            i n

     With these notations, the homology groups Hi (B) of B are the homology groups
of (C• (B), δ). Moreover, if G is an abelian group, then the ohomology groups
Hi (B, G) of B with oeients in G, are the ohomology groups of HomZ (C• (B), G).
In an analogous way, we dene the orresponding omplex (C• (B ♯ ), δ), and obtain
the (o)homology groups of B ♯ .
     5.2. Simpliial (o)homology of algebras. On the other hand, reall that
the simpliial homology of a shurian algebra was dened in [9℄ (see also [24, 26℄
for generalization to the non-shurian ase) in the following way. For every pair of
verties i, j of Q, let Bij be a k−basis of ei Aej . The set B = ∪i,j Bij is said to be
a semi-normed basis if:
      (1) ei ∈ Bii , for every vertex i.
      (2) α ∈ Bij , for every arrow α : i / j
      (3) For σ, σ′ in B , either σσ′ = 0 or there exist λσσ′ ∈ k, and b(σ, σ′ ) ∈ B
          suh that σσ′ = λσσ′ b(σ, σ′ )
     Dene the hain omplex (SC• (A), d) in the following way: SC0 (A), and SC1 (A)
are the free abelian groups with basis Q0 , and B , respetively. For n ≥ 2, let SCn (A)
be the free abelian group with basis the set of n−tuples (σ1 , . . . , σn ) of B n suh
that σ1 σ2 · · · σn 6= 0, and σi 6= ej , for all i, for all j ∈ Q0 . The dierential is indued
by the rules d1 (σ) = y − x when σ ∈ Bxy , and, for n ≥ 1,

A, with oeients in M , with respet to the basis B . Moreover, by dn , we denote
the indued dierential HomZ (dn , M ).
    Remarks.
        (1) Not every algebra of the form A = kQ/I admits a semi-normed basis.
            However, it is shown in [24℄ that if the universal over of (Q, I) is shurian,
            then A admits a semi-normed basis. In partiular all shurian algebras
            admit semi-normed basis.
        (2) On the other hand, A has a semi-normed basis B , the groups SCi depend
            essentially on the way B is related to I . Hene, as for fundamental groups,
            dierent presentations of the algebra may lead to dierent simpliial ho-
            mology groups, as the following well-known example shows: Consider the
            quiver Q
                                            β
                                                  (      α   /1
                                        3         62
                                            γ

          Let I1 be the ideal generated by βα, and Aν1 = kQ/I1 . Assoiated to
          this presentation, there is a semi-normed basis {e1 , e2 , e3 , α, β, γ, γα}, and
          with respet to this basis, SC2 (Aν1 ) has as basis {(γ, α)}, and this leads
          to SH1 (Aν1 ) = Z.
                On the other hand, let I2 be the ideal generated by (β−γ)α, and Aν2 =
          kQ/I2 . It is easy to see that Aν1 ≃ Aν2 . With this presentation, one has
          the same semi-normed basis, however SC2 (Aν2 ) has a basis {(γ, α), (β, α)},
          and this leads to SH1 (Aν2 ) = 0.
      (3) As noted in [24℄, in ase A is shurian one an identify a basis element
          (σ1 , . . . , σn ) of SCn (A) with the (n + 1)−tuple (x0 , x1 , . . . , xn ) of verties
          of Q, where σi ∈ exi−1 Aexi , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n (ompare with example 2 in
          setion 2.2). Thus, for shurian algebras the simpliial homology groups
          are independent of the semi-normed basis with respet to whih they are
          omputed. Moreover, it is straightforward that in this ase one has, for
          every i ≥ 0, Hi (B) ≃ SHi (A), and Hi (B, G) ≃ SHi (A, G) for every abelian
          group G.
    The last remark is in fat a partiular ase of a more general result. Before
stating and proving it we need the following tehnial lemma.
    5.3. Lemma. Let         A = kQ/I be an algebra having a semi-normed basis B ,
then:
16                                              J. C. BUSTAMANTE




         a) For every non-zero path w there exist a unique basis element b(w) and a
            salar λ suh that w = λb(w).
         b) For every basis element v ∈ B , there exist a non-zero path p(v) and a
            salar µ suh that v = µp(v). Moreover, if p(v) and p′ (v) are two suh
              paths, then they are naturally homotopi.
         c) If w1 , w2 are two non-zero paths with w1 ∼◦ w2 , then there is a salar
            λ ∈ k suh that w 2 = λw 1

Proof :
         a) This follows from an easy indution on the length l(w) of the path w.
         b) Let σ ∈ Bxy , and w1 , w2 , . . . , wr be paths from x to y suh that {wi | 1 ≤
            i ≤ r} is a basis of ex Aey . It follows from a) that there exists λi ∈ k\{0}
            and b(wi ) ∈ Bxy suh that wi = λi b(wi ). Hene, Bxy = {b(w1 ), . . . , b(wr )}
            so σ = b(wi0 ) = λi0 wi0 for some i0 suh that 1 ≤ i0 ≤ r. Then set
            p(σ) = wi0 . Moreover, if p(σ) and p′ (σ) are two dierent suh paths and
            µ, µ′ salars suh that σ = µp(σ) = µ′ p′ (σ) we get µp(σ) − µ′ p′ (σ) =
            σ − σ = 0 whih is a minimal relation, and this shows that p(σ) and p′ (σ)
              are naturally homotopi.
         c) Let w1 , w2 be two parallel homotopi paths, and suppose that w 1 and
            w 2 are linearly independent. Without loss of generality, we an assume
            that w1 and w2 appear in the same minimal relation. One then has
            P

      5.4. Theorem. Let                A = kQ/I be an algebra having a semi-normed basis,
then:
         a) There exists an epimorphism of omplexes φ♯• : SC• (A)                              / C• (B ♯ ) ,
         b) There exists an isomorphism of omplexes φ• : SC• (A)                              / C• (B) .

Proof : It is lear that                 C0 (B) ≃ C0 (B ♯ ) ≃ SC0 (A). For n ≥ 1, onsider the
morphisms        φ♯n   and φn dened by

     φ♯n : SCn (A)                     / Cn (B ♯ )           φn : SCn (A)                      / Cn (B)
                                                                                                               ◦
       (σ1 , . . . , σn )
                                  ]
                                / (p(σ             ^          (σ1 , . . . , σn )
                                                                                      / ]◦               ^

It follows from the seond statement in lemma 5.3 that φ♯n and φn are epimorphisms
of abelian groups. Moreover, it is lear that they ommute with the boundary

operators involved. This proves the rst statement. In order to prove the seond,
onsider the map
                          ψn : Cn (B)                                           / SCn (A)

                              (e             en◦ )                   / (b(σ1 ), . . . , b(σn )).

     The fat that the denition of ψn is not ambiguous follows from the third
statement in lemma 5.3. It is lear that ψn ommutes with the boundary operators,
so it denes a morphism of omplexes. Finally, it is straightforward to hek that
φ• and ψ• are mutually inverse.
                                                                                                   

    5.5. Corollary. With the above hypotheses, for eah i ≥ 0, there are isomor-
phisms of abelian groups
      a) Hi (B) ≃ SHi (A), and
      b) Hi (B, G) ≃ SHi (A, G), for every abelian group G.
                                                                                                   

    Remark. In ase G is a ommutative ring R, then the omplexes involved are
endowed with a anonial up produt. This provides to H• (A, R) = ⊕i≥0 Hi (A, R),
and H• (B, R) = ⊕i≥0 Hi (B, R), a graded ommutative ring struture. A diret
omputation shows that the morphisms indued in ohomology φ• , φ♯• , and ψ•
preserve these produts. Thus, the morphisms in the orollary above are ring
homomorphisms.

           Thus, B and B ♯ do not have the same homotopy type. However, note that
           A = kQ/I , does not have a semi-normed basis.

    Reall that, given an arwise topologial spae X , the Hurewiz-Poinaré the-
orem (see [31℄, for instane) states that its rst homology group, H1 (X) is the
abelianisation of its fundamental group π1 (X). This allows to prove the following.

     5.6. Corollary. Let A = kQ/I be a onstrited algebra having a semi-normed
basis. Then its rst simpliial (o)homology groups are independent of the presen-
tation of A.
Proof : For suh an algebra one has
                                           π1 (B)              π1 (Q, I)

     On the other hand, the universal oeients theorem gives

                SH1 (A, G)     ≃   HomZ (SH1 (A), G) ⊕ Ext1Z (SH0 (A), G)
                               ≃   HomZ (SH1 (A), G).

                                                                                              
     We now turn to the Hohshild ohomology of algebras.

                               6. Hohshild ohomology
     Reall that for an arbitrary k-algebra A, its enveloping algebra is the tensor
produt Ae = A ⊗k Aop . Thus, an A − A−bimodule an be seen equivalently as an
Ae -module. The Hohshild ohomology groups HHi (A, M ) of an algebra A with
oeients in some A−A−bimodule M , are, by denition the groups ExtiAe (A, M ).
In ase M is the A − A−bimodule A AA , we simply denote them by HHi (A). We
refer the reader to [11, 22, 29℄, for instane, for general results about Hohshild
(o)-homology of algebras.

    6.1. A onvenient resolution. In [12℄, Cibils gave a onvenient projetive
resolution of A over Ae . Let E be the subalgebra of A generated by the verties
of Q. Note that E is semi-simple, and that A = radA ⊕ E as E − E−bimodule.
Let radA⊗n denote the nth tensor power of radA with itself over E . With these
notations, one has a projetive resolution of A as A − A−module:

                                         bn                                  bn−1

                / A ⊗E radA ⊗E A                     / A ⊗E A                       /A   /0

     where d0 is the multipliation and
     bn (a ⊗ σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn ⊗ b) =         aσ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn ⊗ b
                                            n−1
                                            X
                                       +          (−1)j a ⊗ σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σj σj+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn b
                                            j=1
                                       +    (−1)n a ⊗ σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn b.
    Moreover, there is an obvious natural isomorphism HomAe (A ⊗E radA⊗n ⊗E
A, A) ≃ HomE e (radA⊗n , A). This will be useful later. We denote by bn the orre-
sponding boundary operator, and, moreover, we let bn = HomE e (bn , A).

   Remark. Note that the tensor produts are taken over E . Thus, if σ1 , σ2 ∈
radA, with, say σ1 ∈ ei Aej , and σ2 ∈ el Aem then, in radA⊗2 , one has

                            σ1 ⊗ σ2 = σ1 ej ⊗ el σ2 = σ1 ⊗ ej el σ2
and this vanishes if j 6= l. The same argument shows that radA⊗n is generated by
elements of the form σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn where σi ∈ ei−1 Aei for 1 < i ≤ n. Moreover, if
A admits a semi-normed basis B , then using k−linearity, one an assume that eah
σi is an element of B .
     Following [24℄, for n ≥ 1, dene ǫn : HomZ (SCn (A), k+ ) / HomE e (radA⊗n , A)
in the following way: for f ∈ HomZ (SCn (A), k+ ), and a basis element (σ1 , . . . σn ),
put ǫn (f )(σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn ) = f (σ1 , . . . , σn )σ1 · · · σn whenever (σ1 , . . . , σn ) ∈ SCn (A),
and 0 otherwise.
     Also, for n ≥ 1, dene µn : HomE e (radA⊗n , A) / HomZ (SCn (A), k+ ) as fol-
lows: for a basis element (σ1 , . . . , σn ) in SCn (A), we have σ1 σ2 · · · σn 6= 0, and
lies in, say, e0 Aen , whih an be written as the diret sum of k−vetor-spaes
< σ1 σ2 · · · σn > ⊕A′0n . Moreover, σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn ∈ radA⊗n , thus, for g ∈
HomE e (radA⊗n , A) we have:

           g(σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn ) = g(e0 σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn en ) = e0 g(σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn )en
so that g(σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn ) ∈ e0 Aen , and there is a salar λ and a0 ∈ A′0n suh that
g(σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn ) = λσ1 σ2 · · · σn + a0 . Dene µn (g)(σ1 , . . . , σn ) = λ.

     6.2. Lemma [24℄. With the above notations, one has:
       a) µn ǫn = id, for n ≥ 1,
       b) ǫ• is a morphism of omplexes,
       c) If A is shurian, then µ• is a morphism of omplexes.

     Remark. In [20℄, it was shown that for inidene algebras, the morphisms
Hi (ǫ) are isomorphisms. Moreover, as a onsequene of a result of [15℄ (see also
[10℄), H1 (ǫ) is also an isomorphism for shurian triangular algebras. Thus, in light
of [24℄ (or Lemma 6.2 above), one may naturally ask if in ase A is shurian, the
monomorphisms Hi (ǫ) are isomorphisms. As the following example shows, this is
not always the ase.

On the other hand, using for instane, Happel's long exat sequene [22℄, one gets

    Reall that an algebra A = kQ/I is said to be semi-ommutative [22℄ when-
ever for w, w′ paths sharing origin and terminus in Q, then w ∈ I if and only
if w′ ∈ I . For instane, inidene algebras are semi-ommutative. Shurian tri-
angular, semi-ommutative algebras are also alled weakly transitive [16℄. The
algebra in the preeding example is shurian, but not semi-ommutative. This leads
to the main result of this setion, whih is a generalization of a result of Gersten-
haber and Shak [20℄, and makes more preise a result of Martins and de la Peña
(theorem 3 in [24℄).
    6.3. Theorem. Let A = kQ/I be a shurian triangular, semi-ommutative
algebra. Then, for eah i ≥ 0, there is an isomorphism of abelian groups
                                                        ∼
                              Hi (ǫ) : SHi (A, k + )         / HHi (A) .


Proof : In light of lemma 6.2, there only remains to show that if           A is semi-
ommutative then ǫn µn = id for n ≥ 1. Let f ∈ HomE e (radA⊗n , A), and σ1 ⊗
· · · ⊗ σn be a basis element in radA⊗n , with, say σ1 σ2 · · · σn ∈ e0 Aen . Assume
σ1 σ2 · · · σn 6= 0. Sine A is shurian, there exists some salar λ suh that f (σ1 ⊗
· · · ⊗ σn ) = λσ1 · · · · · · σn , thus (µn f )(σ1 , . . . , σn ) = λ, and


               (ǫn µn f )(σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn )    = ((µn f )(σ1 , . . . , σn ))σ1 · · · σn
                                               = λσ1 . . . σn
                                               = f (σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn )
     On the other hand, if σ1 · · · σn = 0, then,
               (ǫn µn f )(σ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σn ) = ((µn f )(σ1 , . . . , σn ))σ1 · · · σn = 0
Moreover, sine A is semi-ommutative we have e0 Aen = 0, and therefore f (σ1 ⊗
· · · ⊗ σn ) = 0.
                                                                                           

    Remark. Again, it is straightforward to hek that ǫ• are µ• preserve up-
produts, thus the isomorphism above indue a ring isomorphism.

    6.4. Corollary [20℄. Let (Σ, ≤) be a nite poset and A = A(Σ) be its in-
idene algebra, then, for eah i ≥ 0, there is an isomorphism of abelian groups
Hi (BΣ, k + ) ≃ HHi (A).
                                                                                           

    Remark. There exist algebras whih are not semi-ommutative, but there are
still an isomorphisms Hi (ǫ) : SHi (A, k+ )     ≃       / HHi (A) for all i ≥ 0. Consider the
following quiver Q
                                        α2
                               α1  l64       / 3 α3 / 2 RR α4
                                 ll                        RRRR
                              lll                               (
                            6 XXXXXXXX                       ff2 1

                                    β1         5      β2

and let A = kQ/I where I =< α1 α2 , α3 α4 >. This algebra is shurian, but not
semi-ommutative. One an easily ompute
                                                    
                        i       +         i             k   if i = 0, 1,
                    SH (A, k ) = HH (A) =
                                                        0   otherwise.
    Keeping in mind the last theorem, and proposition 3.1, we an get new short
algebrai-topology avored proofs of some well-known results in [22, 5℄ about the
Hohshild ohomology groups of monomial algebras. Let χ(Q) be the Euler har-
ateristi of Q, that is, let χ(Q) = 1 − |Q0 | + |Q1 |.

    6.5. Corollary [22℄. Let A = kQ/I be a monomial semi-ommutative shurian
algebra, then
      a) HH0 (A) = k .
      b) dimk HH1 (A) = χ(Q).
      c) HHi (A) = 0 for i ≥ 2.

Proof : With the above hypotheses, the graph Q is a strong deformation retrat
of B(Q, I), and theorem 6.3 holds. The results follow diretly.
                                                                                           

    6.6. Corollary [4℄. Let A = kQ/I be a monomial algebra, then the following
are equivalent:
      a) HHi (A) = 0 for i > 0.
      b) HH1 (A) = 0.
      c) Q is a tree.

Proof : It is trivial that a) implies b). In order to show that b) implies c) assume
that Q is not a tree. Again, sine I is monomial, Q is a strong deformation retrat
of B(Q, I), and, sine it is not a tree, we have dimk SH1 (A, k+ ) = χ(Q) > 0. The
result then follows from lemma 6.2. Finally, we show that c) implies a). If Q is a
tree, then A is shurian semi-ommutative, thus theorem 6.3 applies. But Q, whih
is a strong deformation retrat of B(Q, I), is an ayli 1−dimensional omplex.
The result follows diretly.
                                                                                           
