                                                                                          Abstract
                                                This paper gives a classification of parabolic subalgebras of simple Lie algebras
                                             over C that are complexifications of parabolic subalgebras of real forms for which
                                             Lynch’s vanishing theorem for generalized Whittaker modules is non-vacuous. The
                                             paper also describes normal forms for the admissible characters in the sense of
                                             Lynch (at least in the quasi-split cases) and analyzes the important special case
                                             when the parabolic is defined by an even embedded TDS (three dimensional simple
                                             Lie algebra).

                                                                                       Introduction
                                                If g is a semi-simple Lie algebra over C and if p P  is a parabolic subalgebraP of g
                                             then there is a Z-grade of g as a Lie algebra, g = j gj such that p = j≥0 gj
                                                         P
                                             and if n = j>0 gj then n is the nilradical of p and g1 projects bijectively onto the
                                             abelianization (n/[n, n]) of n. The purpose of this article is to give a classification of
                                             those parabolic subalgebras such that there is a Richardson element x ∈ n such that
                                             x ∈ g1 . That is there exists x ∈ g1 such that [p, x] = n. A parabolic subalgebra will
                                             be called nice if it satisfies this condition. These parabolic subalgebras are exactly
                                             the complexifications of the real parabolic subalgebras whose nilradicals support
                                             admissible Lie algebra homomorphisms to iR in the sense of Lynch’s thesis [L]. In
                                             that thesis Lynch proved a generalization of Kostant’s vanishing theorem for Whit-
                                             taker modules [K] (valid for generic Lie algebra homomorphisms to iR of nilradicals
                                             of Borel subalgebras of quasisplit real forms). Of course, Lynch’s theorem is vac-
                                             uous if the nilradical of the parabolic subalgebra admits no such homomorphisms.
                                             He introduced the term admissible for the parabolic sublagebras whose nilradicals
                                             admit admissible homomorphisms. Thus an admissible parabolic in the sense of
                                             Lynch is a real form of a nice parabolic in our sense.
                                                It is clear that a parabolic subalgebra is nice if and only if its intersection with
                                             each ideal is nice. Thus it is enough to do the classification for simple Lie algebras
                                             over C. The complete classification is given in section 1 and the rest of the paper
                                             is devoted to the proof of the correctness of the list (sections 3 and 4), and to a
                                             description of the corresponding Richardson elements (admissible elements in the
                                             sense of Lynch). The proofs of the assertions in section 5 will appear in [B].

   In [W] the second named author used his extension of the Lynch results to prove
a holomorphic continuation of generalized Jacquet integrals for degenerate principal
series under the real analogue of the condition of niceness. These results contain all
known cases of continuation, holomorphy and (essentially) uniqueness for Jaquet
integrals and Whittaker models. Thus the results of this paper explain both the
range of applicability of those results and their limitations.
   In [L] Lynch studies the classification of his admissible parabolic subalgebras.
His results are correct for types An , F4 and G2 .
   The paper [EK] studies
                     P      the notion of a good grade of a semi-simple algebra. This
is a Z-grade of g = j gj as a Lie algebra such that there is an element x ∈ g2 such
                           P
that ad(x) is injective on j<0 gj . Theorem 2.1 implies that a good grade with all
                                                       P
odd components equal to 0 defines a nice parabolic j≥0 gj . Thus a classification
of good grades yields as a special case a classification of nice parabolic subalgebras.
That said we have decided that the special case was of sufficient importance to
have an independent exposition even if the paper [EK] were without any errors
(see the remark before Theorem 1.4). Also, our description of the answer for the
classical groups is (we hope) simpler than that given in [EK]. In addition, we have
endeavored to give enough detail that a serious reader could with little additional
effort check that the results are correct.
   The authors would like to thank Elashvili for informing them of his work with
Kac. For obvious reasons there is substantial overlap between our papers. Many
of the general results in section 2 can be found in the second named author’s
manuscript [W] that has been freely available on his web site (in various forms) for
at least two years and in [EK].

                          1. Statement of the results
   If not specified otherwise, g will denote a simple Lie algebra over the complex
numbers. Fix a Borel subalgebra b in g, let h ⊂ b be a Cartan subalgebra of g. We
will denote the set of simple roots relative to this choice by ∆ = {α1 , . . . , αn }. We
always use the Bourbaki-numbering of simple roots.
   Let p ⊂ g be a parabolic subalgebra, p = m ⊕ u (where m is a Levi factor and u
the corresponding nilpotent radical of p). After conjugation we can assume that p
contains the chosen Borel subalgebra and m ⊃ h. If b has been fixed then we will
say that p is standard if p ⊃ b from now on. In particular, if p is standard then it
is given by a subset of ∆, namely the simple roots such that both roots spaces g±α
belong to the Levi factor of p.
   Thus such a parabolic subalgebra is described by a n-tuple, (u1 , ..., un ) in {0, 1}n:
ones correspond to simple roots with root spaces not in m. Equivalently, a parabolic
subalgebra is given by a coloring of the Dynkin diagram of the Lie algebra: a
black (colored) node corresponds to a simple root whose root space belongs to
m. Here, one has to be very careful since there exist different notations. Our
choice was motivated by the coloring for Satake diagrams. Let (u1 , ..., un ) define
the parabolic subalgebra p and and P H ∈ h be defined by αi (H) = ui . If we set
gi = {x ∈ g|[H, x] = ix} then p = i≥0 gi .

1.1. Results in the classical cases. As is usual, we will refer to the simple Lie
algebras of type An , Bn , Cn , Dn as the classical Lie algebras and the remaining five
simple Lie algebras will be called exceptional. We realize the classical Lie algebras
            NICE PARABOLIC SUBALGEBRAS OF REDUCTIVE LIE ALGEBRAS                                 3


as subalgebras of glN for N = n + 1, 2n + 1, 2n, 2n respectively. With An the
trace zero matrices, Bn , Dn the orthogonal Lie algebra of the symmetric form with
matrix with all entries 0 except for those on the skew diagonal which are 1 and
Cn the symplectic Lie algebra for the symplectic form with matrix whose only
nonzero entries are skew diagonal and the first n are 1 and the last n are −1.
With this realization we take as our choice of Borel subalgebra the intersection of
the corresponding Lie algebra with the upper triangular matrices in glN . We will
call a parabolic subalgebra that contains this Borel subalgebra standard. If p is a
standard parabolic subalgebra then we refer to the Levi factor that contains the
diagonal Cartan subalgebra, h, by m and call it the standard Levi factor.
    Thus for all classical Lie algebras the standard Levi factor is then in diagonal
block form given by a sequence of square matrices on the diagonal. For the or-
thogonal and symplectic Lie algebras, these sequences are palindromic. If p is a
parabolic subalgebra for one of these Lie algebras then if m is the standard Levi
factor of the parabolic subalgebra to which it is conjugate then we will say that m
is the standard Levi factor.
Theorem 1.1. For type An a parabolic subalgebra is nice if and only if the sequence
of the block lengths of its standard Levi factor is unimodal.
Theorem 1.2. For type Bn a parabolic subalgebra p is nice if and only if its stan-
dard Levi factor either has unimodal block lengths or the block lengths are of the
form
              a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ ar > b1 = b2 = ... = bs < ar ≥ ... ≥ a1
with b1 = ar − 1 and if r > 1 then ar−1 < ar .
Theorem 1.3. For type Cn a parabolic subalgebra is nice if and only if the sequence
of block lengths of its standard Levi factor is unimodal and if the number of blocks
is odd then each odd block length occurs exactly twice.
    Before we state our result for Dn a word should be said about the ambiguity in
describing parabolic subalgebras in the case of Dn . We note that the intersection of
the standard parabolic subalgebra with block sizes [a1 , a2 , ..., ar , 1, 1, ar , ..., a2 , a1 ]
for GL(d) (d = 2(a1 +...+ar +1)) with so(d) is the same as the intersection with the
standard parabolic with block lengths [a1 , a2 , ..., ar , 2, ar , ..., a2 , a1 ]. In the following
theorem we we will only look at the second version of the parabolic subgroup. The
first two types in Theorem 6.4 (i),(ii) in [EK] do not appear in our result directly
because of this choice.
    We should also point out that there is a difference between our statement and
that of [EK] involving the last part of this result and Theorem 6.4 (i) and (ii)
in [EK]. Their list is missing all cases with s even and ar > 3. In addition to having
a (perhaps too) detailed proof of the following result in this paper the authors have
done extensive computer computations which agree with our formulation for n ≤ 20.
Theorem 1.4. For type Dn a parabolic subalgebra is nice if and only if its standard
Levi factor (taking into account the choice made above) has one of the following
forms:
   1) It is unimodal with an odd number of blocks.
   2) It is unimodal with an even number of block lengths and the odd block lengths
occur exactly twice.

    3) The block lengths are of the form




               a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ ar > b1 = b2 = ... = bs < ar ≥ ... ≥ a1




with b1 = ar − 1, ar is odd and ar−1 < ar and if s is even then the odd block lengths
occur exactly twice.




1.2. Results in the exceptional cases. In this subsection we will state the clas-
sification of nice parabolic subalgebras for the exceptional simple Lie algebras. The
parabolic subalgebra will be given by an n-tuple where n is the rank and the en-
tries are αi (H) where H is the element that gives the grade corresponding to the
parabolic subalgebra and the αi are the simple roots in the Bourbaki order.
    The only nice parabolic subalgebras in type G2 , F4 are those that are given by
an even sl2 -triple (see the next section for the definition). They are listed below.

                       2. Characterizations of niceness
   In this section we study the notion of niceness and prove properties of nice
parabolic subalgebras. Recall that a parabolic subalgebra induces a Z-grading of g
via the map ad H where H ∈ h is defined as in the beginning of section 1. We will
also use the notation B for the Killing form of g.
Theorem 2.1. Let p ⊂ g with associated grading g = ⊕j∈Z gj . The following are
equivalent:
    (1) p is nice
    (2) There exists X ∈ g1 such that ad(X) : gj → gj+1 is surjective for all j ≥ 0.
    (3) There exists X ∈ g1 such that ad(X) : gj → gj+1 is surjective for all j > 0.
    (4) There exists X ∈ g1 such that ad(X) : gj−1 → gj is injective for all j ≤ 0.
Proof. Let X ∈ g1 be such that [p, X] = n. Then since
                                  p = g0 ⊕ g1 ⊕ ... ⊕ gr
6                        KARIN BAUR AND NOLAN WALLACH


we must have ad(X)gi = gi+1 for i ≥ 0. This proves the necessity of condition 2).
The sufficiency is equally clear. To prove 3) we will show that 3) implies 2). Let Ω
be the set of all X ∈ g1 satisfying the condition in 3). Then Ω is Zariski open and
dense in g1 . We also note that if Λ is the set of all X ∈ g1 such that [X, p] = g1
then it is also Zariski open and dense. Hence Ω ∩ Λ 6= ∅. We have proved that 3)
implies 2).                                             P                P
   We now prove 4). For this we observe that if n =       gi (resp. p =     gi ) then
                                                        i<0               i≤0
y ∈ n (resp. y ∈ p) is 0 if and only if B(y, n) = {0} (resp. B(y, p) = {0}). Let
X ∈ g1 be such that [p, X] = n. Then if y ∈ n and [X, y] = 0 then
                    {0} = B([X, y], p) = B(y, [X, p]) = B(y, n).
So y = 0. Suppose that X ∈ g1 and ad X : n → g is injective then we assert
that ad X : p → n is surjective. Indeed, if not there would exist y ∈ n with
B(y, [p, X]) = {0} but y 6= 0. But B(y, [p, X]) = B([X, y], p) and since [X, n] ⊂ p
we would have the contradiction y 6= 0 but [X, y] = 0.                           
   As a consequence we have the following useful criterion for the exceptional Lie
algebras.
Corollary 2.2. If p ⊂ g is nice then
  (i) dim gj ≥ dim gj+1 for all j > 1.
  (ii) dim g1 > dim g2 .
Proof. Part (2) of Theorem 2.1 gives (i). Note that the line through X is in the
kernel of the map ad X : g1 → g2 . This gives part (ii).                      
   Any nonzero nilpotent element x of a complex semisimple Lie algebra is the nil-
positive element of an sl2 -triple {x, h, y} (Jacobson-Morozov Theorem, cf. Section
3.3 in [CM]). The next result describes a large class of examples of nice parabolic
subalgebras (most of them in many simple Lie algebras) .
Lemma 2.3. Let p ⊂ g with grading g = ⊕j∈Z gj . Assume that there is a nonzero
x ∈ g1 and y ∈ g such that the sl2 -triple of x is {x, 2H, y}. Then p is nice.
Proof. This follows from part (4) of Theorem 2.1 since the kernel of ad x is contained
in the sum of the eigenspaces for the eigenvalues of 2H that are non-negative
integers.                                                                           
   If p ⊂ g is a subalgebra satisfying the assumptions of Lemma 2.3, we will say
that p is given by an even TDS (by a three-dimensional simple subalgebra).
   We recall a helpful result of [W]: Let g be a simple Lie algebra with Dynkin
diagram △. Let △′ be a connected subdiagram of △ and g′ the corresponding
simple Lie algebra. If p ⊂ g is a parabolic subalgebra we denote the parabolic
subalgebra p ∩ g′ by p′ .
Lemma 2.4. If p ⊂ g is nice then for every g′ obtained as above, p′ is nice.
Proof. Let n′ be the nilradical of p′ and let n be the nilradical of p. Let u ∈ h be
such that if α ∈/ ∆′ then α(u) = 1. Let v be the direct sum of the eigenspaces for
strictly positive eigenvalues of ad u. Then v is an ideal in n and since n = n′ ⊕ v,
n′ ∼
   = n/v. Let p denote the projection from n onto n/v. Let X ∈ g1 be as in (2) of
Theorem 2.1. Let X ′ be the unique element in n′ such that p(X ′ ) = p(X). Then it
is easy to see that X ′ ∈ g′1 and satisfies (3) of Theorem 2.1.                   

   Lemma 2.4 has two consequences: on one hand any subdiagram of a nice para-
bolic subalgebra is again nice. On the other hand, if a diagram contains a subdia-
gram that is not nice, then the “big” diagram is not nice.
   The following result will be one of our main tools in our proofs of the theorems
in the previous section.
Theorem 2.5. Let p be a parabolic subalgebra of g, p = m ⊕ u where    P m is a
Levi factor of p and u the corresponding nilpotent radical. Let g =    gj be the
corresponding grade. Then
   x ∈ g1 is a Richardson element of p if and only if dim gx = dim m.
                                           P
Proof. We denote the opposite nilradical, j<0 gj , by u. If x ∈ u then ad(x)g =
ad(x)u + ad(x)p. Now ad(x)p ⊂ u and dim ad(x)u ≤ dim u. Thus
                                dim ad(x)g ≤ 2 dim u.
This implies for x ∈ u that dim gx ≥ dim m and equality implies that dim ad(x)p =
          P equality implies that x is a Richardson element. If x ∈ g1 then
dim u. Thus
ad(x)u ⊂ j≤0 gj . If x is a Richardson element then since ad(x) is injective on u
the kernel of ad(x) is contained in p (see Theorem 2.1 (4)). Since ad(x)p = u we
have proved that dim gx = dim m.                                                
    We recall that distinguished nilpotent elements of g are nilpotent elements that
are not containedPin any Levi factor m ( g. Let x ∈ g1 be nilpotent, let x, 2H, y be
a TDS and g =       gi the grading given by H. Then x is distinguished if and only
if dim m = dim g1 (cf. Section 8.2 of [CM]).
Corollary 2.6. Let p ( g and x ∈ g1 a Richardson element with dim m > dim g1 .
Then x is not a distinguished nilpotent element for g.
Proof. Follows directly from Theorem 2.5.                                             

                   3. The determination of Jordan forms
   We use the notation Mp,q (C) for the p × q matrices over C. Let n1 , ..., nr > 0
with r ≥ 2 be given. Then we define a map φ : Mn1 ,n2 (C) × Mn2 ,n3 (C) × · · · ×
Mnr−1 ,nr (C) → Mn1 ,nr (C) by φ(X1 , ..., Xr−1 ) = X1 · · · Xr−1 . The following should
be well known. Since it will be used several times we include a proof.
Lemma 3.1. If r ≥ 2 then φ is a surjection onto the variety Yn1 ,nr ,m = {X ∈
Mn1 ,nr |rank(X) ≤ m} with m = min{n1 , ..., nr }.
Proof. If V is a vector space over C then we will use the notation PV for the
projective space of V . We observe that φ induces a regular map of PMn1 ,n2 (C) ×
PMn2 ,n2 (C) × · · · × PMnr−1 ,nr (C) into PMn1 ,nr (C). We will prove that the image
of this map is the projective variety Z = {[X] ∈ PMn1 ,nr (C)|∆(X) = 0 for all
m + 1 × m + 1 minors of X}. This will clearly prove the Lemma. We first observe
that Y = Yn1 ,nr ,m is an irreducible affine variety. Indeed, define the n1 × nr matrix
J by                                              
                                            I 0
                                     J=              ,
                                            0 0
with I the m × m identity matrix. Then the set of matrices in Mn1 ,nr (C) of rank
exactly m is U = {gJh−1 |g ∈ GL(n1 , C), h ∈ GL(nr , C)}. Since U is irreducible as
8                         KARIN BAUR AND NOLAN WALLACH


a quasi-projective variety (indeed it is affine) and Y is the Zariski closure of U the
irreducibility follows.
   We now prove the result by induction on r. If r = 2 then φ is the identity map
and the result is obvious. Assume for r and we will now prove it for r + 1. By the
above and the inductive hypothesis it is enough tp show that the set H = {W X|X ∈
                                                                     ′
Mnr ,nr+1 (C), W ∈ Yn1 ,nr ,m is Zariski dense in Yn1 ,nr+1 ,m′ with
                                                                  m = min{nr+1, m}.
To see this
             we observe that if J is as above and if K is I 0 if nr ≤ nr+1
      I
or         if nr > nr+1 then the set {gJKh−1|g ∈ GL(n1 , C), h ∈ GL(nr+1 , C)} is
      0
contained in H and JK is the “J” for Yn1 ,nr+1 ,m′ .                                
   We now consider a standard parabolic subalgebra p of An , n ≥ 1. Then p is
given by integers n1 , ..., nr > 0 with n1 + ... + nr = n + 1. We think of the matrices
as given in r × r block form with the i-th diagonal block of size ni × ni . Then the
grade corresponding to p is given by bracket with
                              r−1                               

                                                   ..

Thus x ∈ g1 is of the block form
                                                                     

with Xi a ni × ni+1 matrix. If we consider the j-th power of x then it has all of
its (possibly) non-zero entries in the j + 1-st super-diagonal and those entries are
X1 X2 · · · Xj , X2 X3 · · · Xj+1 , ..., Xr−j Xr+1−j · · · Xr−1 . We have
Lemma 3.2. If x ∈ g1 is generic then xj has rank equal to

                            P
                                       min{ni , ni+1 , ..., ni+j−1 }.
                             i=1

   This is a simple application of the above observation, and Lemma 3.1.
   We now recall an algorithm for calculating the Jordan canonical form of a nilpo-
tent matrix. Let x be a nilpotent n + 1 × n + 1 matrix. We assume that its Jordan
canonical form has as blocks of size s for s = 1, ..., m and xm = 0. If J is a nilpotent
Jordan block of size k then the dimension of the kernel of J s is s for s = 1, ..., k − 1
and k for s ≥ k. Hence a1 , ..., ar satsify the system of linear equations
                      a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + ar−1 + ar = dim ker x

                   a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 + ... + 2ar−1 + 2ar = dim ker x2

                                                                 .
           a1 + 2a2 + 3a3 + ... + (r − 1)ar−1 + (r − 1)ar = dim ker xr−1
           a1 + 2a2 + 3a3 + ... + (r − 1)ar−1 + rar = dim ker xr = n + 1.

   We will now study the Jordan forms for the other classical Lie algebras. We will
use the versions of these Lie algebras as they are given in [GW]. We will now give
the analogue of Proposition 3.3 for these cases. We start with the case of Cn .
Proposition 3.4. Let g be of type Cn and let p is a standard parabolic subal-
gebra. Let x ∈ g1 be a generic element. If p is given by an even number of
blocks then the element x is generic for the corresponding parabolic subgroup of
sl2n and thus its Jordan form is calculated as in Proposition 3.3. If there are an
odd number of blocks the Jordan form is calculated as follows: write the block sizes
as n1 , ..., nr , nr+1 , nr+2 , ..., n2r+1 and denote this 2r + 1 tuple by n. We define
a non-negative integer rij (n) as follows. If i < 1, j < 1 or i + j > 2r + 1 then
rij (n) = 0. We now assume i, j ≥ 1 and i + j ≤ 2r + 1. If i + j ≤ r + 1 or
if i ≥ r + 1 then rij (n) = min{ni , ni+1 , ..., ni+j }. If i ≤ r and i + j > r + 1
then we set s = min{ni , ni+1 , ..., ni+j }, u = min{r + 1 − i, i + j − r − 1} and
v = min{nr+1−u , nr+2−u , ..., nr+1+u }. If v is odd set t = v − 1 if v is even set
t = v, then rij (n) = min{s, t}. Then the rank of xj is
                                        X
                             rj (n) =       rij (n), j > 0, r0 (n) = 2n.
                                      i
For each 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r + 1 there are rj−1 (n) − 2rj (n)+rj+1 (n) blocks of size j in the
Jordan form of x.
   The result for Bn and Dn is similarly complicated. Also we will follow the
convention introduced in the discussion before Theorem 1.4 to resolve the ambiguity
in the cases where there are an even number of block sizes and the central pair are
both of size 1. These cases are ignored and we use the description of the same
parabolic now with one less block size and all sizes the same except that the 1,1 is
replaced by a 2.
Proposition 3.5. Let g be of type Bn or Dn and let p is a standard parabolic
subalgebra and let d = 2n + 1 in the case of Bn and d = 2n for Dn . Let x ∈ g1 be
a generic element. If p is given by an odd number of blocks then the element x is
10                         KARIN BAUR AND NOLAN WALLACH


generic for the corresponding parabolic subgroup of sld and thus its Jordan form is
calculated as in Proposition 3.3. If there are an even number of blocks the Jordan
form is calculated as follows: write the block sizes as n1 , ..., nr , nr+2 , ..., n2r+1 and
denote this 2r tuple by n. We define a non-negative integer rij (n) as follows.
If i < 1, j < 1 or i + j > 2r then rij (n) = 0. We now assume i, j ≥ 1 and
i + j ≤ 2r. If i + j ≤ r or if i ≥ r then rij (n) = min{ni , ni+1 , ..., ni+j }. If i ≤ r and
i + j ≥ r + 1 then we set s = min{ni , ni+1 , ..., ni+j }, u = min{r + 1 − i, i + j − r}
and v = min{nr+1−u , nr+2−u , ..., nr+u }. If v is odd set t = v − 1 if v is even set
t = v, then rij (n) = min{s, t}. Then the rank of xj is
                                   X
                         rj (n) =      rij (n), j > 0, r0 (n) = 2n.
                                    i
For each 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r + 1 there are rj−1 (n) − 2rj (n)+rj+1 (n) blocks of size j in the
Jordan form of x.
   The intricacy of these statements is evidenced in the complicated proof. We
warn the reader that it will be painful. We will devote the rest of this section to
the proofs of these propositions. For Bn and Dn we will use the form with matrix
having all entries 0 except for ones on the skew diagonal
                                                      

For Cn we use the form given by
                                                       
                                                0 L

                                               −L 0
with L as above. We will use the notation A# for the adjoint of the matrix A
with respect to the indicated form. Thus for Bn , Dn if A has ij entry aij then
A# has ij entry am−j,m−i with m = 2n + 2, 2n + 1 respectively. In the case Cn
we write ηi = 1 if i ≤ n and ηi = −1 if i > n. Then if A has ij entry aij then
A# has ij entry −ηi ηj a2n+1−j,2n+1−i . In all cases, if ei , i = 1, ..., q is the standard
basis with q = 2n + 1, 2n, 2n for Bn , Cn and Dn respectively than if (..., ...) is the
corresponding invariant form on Cq then (ei , eq+1−j ) = ±δij . This implies the
following observations:
(a) If i + p ≤ n + 1 then (..., ...) induces a perfect pairing between
                            Vi,p = spanC {ei , ei+1 , ..., ei+p−1 }
and
                     V̌i,p = spanC {eq+2−i−p , eq+1−i−p , ..., eq+1−i }
(b) In the case of Bn the form (..., ...) induces a nondegenerate form on spanC {ei |n+
1 − p ≤ i ≤ n + 1 + p} for p = 0, ..., n.
(c) In the cases Cn and Dn the form (..., ...) induces a nondegenerate form on
spanC {en−i , en−i+1 , .., en , en+1 , ..., en+i+1 }.
   If p is a standard parabolic subalgebra of one of these Lie algebras then it is
given by a palindromic sequence of the form (A) n1 , ..., nr−1 , nr , nr , nr−1 , ..., n1 or
(B) n1 , ..., nr , m, nr , ..., n1 with ni > 0 and 2(n1 + ... + nr ) = q in the former case
and in the latter in addition m > 0 and 2(n1 + ... + nr ) + m = q. We will use the

corresponding grade on the Lie algebra. Each of these sequences delineates a block
form for the q × q matrices. The elements of g1 have block forms

to V̌n1 +···+ni−1 +1,ni . and Yi = −Xi# with upper # indicating the adjoint map rela-
tive to the indicted perfect pairing. In case (A) Vn1 +...+nr−1 +1,nr = V̌n1 +...+nr−1 +1,nr
so relative to the indicted non-degenerate forms indicated in (b) and (c) above we
have Xr# = −Xr . In case (B) we look upon Xr as a map from Vn1 +...+nr +1,m to
V̌n1 +...+nr +1,m and then Yr = −Xr#.
   We will now begin a calculation of the Jordan canonical form of a generic element
x in g1 as given above. As in the case An we must calculate the rank of xj for
j = 1, ..., 2r − 1 in case (A) and j = 1, ..., 2r in case (B). We need the following
Lemma to handle the case (B) for Cn . Let V1 , ..., Vr , W be finite dimensional
non-zero vector spaces and assume that we have a symplectic (i.e. non-degenerate
skew symmetric bilinear form), h..., ...i on W . If T : Vi+1 → Vi linear then define
T ∗ : Vi∗ → Vi+1  ∗                   ∗
                                by T λ = λ ◦ T . If T : W → Vr then we define
                      
(as# usual)
  #      ∗
T : Vr → W by T λ, w = λ(T w). We leave the following as an exercise whose
proof is similar to that of Lemma 3.1 and will be left to the reader.
Lemma 3.6. Let Ti : Vi+1 → Vi be linear for i = 1, ..., r − 1 and let Tr : W → Vr
be linear then the form on V1∗ defined by
                                       (λ, µ)T = λ(T µ)

                                   · · · T1∗ is skew symmetric. Let Xk be the space of all
skew symmetric forms of rank k on V1∗ . Let s be the minimum of {dim V1 , ..., dim Vr , dim W }
then if s is even set t = s if s is odd set t = s − 1 then the map


     Hom(V2 , V1 ) × Hom(V3 , V2 ) × · · · × Hom(Vr , Vr−1 ) × Hom(W, Vr ) → Xk

                                                                          · · · T1∗ is onto.

   In case (A) the non-zero entries of xj are in the blocks in the j-th diagonal (i.e.
has blocks i, i + j, so the diagonal is the 0-th diagonal). The entries in that diagonal
are of three possible types:
1-A Xi Xi+1 · · · Xi+j−1 if i ≥ 1 and j + i ≤ r + 1 (the i-th entry).
2-A Xi Xi+1 · · · Xr Yr−1 · · · Y2r−i−j+1 if i ≥ 1, 2r > i + j > r + 1 and i ≤ r (the i-th
entry).
3-A Yr−i Yr−i−1 · · · Yr−i−j+1 if i ≥ 1, i + j ≤ r the (r + i-th entry).
   In case (B) there are also three possibilities:
1-B Xi Xi+1 · · · Xi+j−1 if i ≥ 1 and j + i ≤ r + 1 (the i-th entry).
2-B Xi Xi+1 · · · Xr Yr · · · Y2r−i−j+1 if i ≥ 1 and 2r > i + j > r + 1 and i ≤ r (the
i-th entry).
3-B Yr−i Yr−i−1 · · · Yr−i−j+1 if i ≥ 0 and i + j ≤ r the (r + i + 1-th entry).
   We will now compute the generic rank of each of the six types of matrices.
Proposition 3.7. (i) In cases 1-A, and 1-B and i + j ≤ r the generic rank is
min{ni , ..., ni+j }.
   (ii) In case 1-A with i + j = r + 1 the generic rank is min{ni , ..., nr−1 , s} with
s = nr if nr is even or the algebra is symplectic and s = nr − 1 if nr is odd and the
algebra is orthogonal.
   (iii) In case 1-B and i + j = r + 1 the generic rank is min{ni , ..., nr , m}. (Here
recall that m is the block size of the middle block.)
   (iv) In case 2-A if i = 2r − i − j set s = min{ni , . . . , n2r−i−j }. The generic rank
is s if s is even and s − 1 if s is odd. If i < 2r − i − j set s = min{nr , ..., n2r−i−j+1 }
and t = min{ni , ni+1 , .., n2r−i−j }, if i > 2r − i − j then set s = min{ni , ..., nr } and
t = min{n2r−i−j , ..., ni } then there are two possibilities.
         a) If s is even or if we are in the case Cn then the generic rank is min{s, t}.
         b) If s is odd then the generic rank is min{s − 1, t}.
   (v) In case 3-A it is min{nr−i+1 , nr−i , ..., nr−i−j+1 }.
   (vi) In case 3-B it is min{nr−i+1 , nr−i , ..., nr−i−j+1 } if i > 0 and it is
   min{m, nr , nr−i−1 , ..., nr−i−j+1 } if i = 0.
   (vii) In case 2-B it is min{ni , ..., nr , m, nr , nr−1 , ..., n2r−i−j } for orthogonal al-
gebras.
   (viii) In case 2-B for symplectic algebras let k be the minimum of i and 2r − i − j.
Let s = min{nk , ..., nr , m} if s is even then set t = s if s is odd set t = s − 1. Then
the generic rank is min{ni , ..., nr , m, nr , nr−1 , ..., n2r−i−j , t}.
Proof. The cases 1-A for i + j ≤ r ,3-A,1-B,3-B have already been observed in the
study of An . In the case of 1-A with i + j = r + 1 then in the symplectic case the
generic rank of Xr is nr in the orthogonal case it is nr if nr is even and nr − 1 if
it is odd. We look at the case 2-B. This case for orthogonal algebras follows from
Lemma 1 above, the similar fact that (in the notation of Lemma 1) the set
           Z = {XX T |X ∈ Yp,q,r } = {Z|Z T = Z, Z ∈ Mp (C), rk(Z) = r}
is irreducible and the last part of the proof of Lemma 1. For symplectic algebras
we use the previous lemma and a similar argument. We are left with 2-A. In this
case we must look at matrices of the form XZX T with the matrix Z, l × l and
Z T = −Z for the orthogonal cases and M Z T M = Z (with M as above) in the
symplectic case. In the orthogonal cases if X is generic of rank a and Z is generic
           NICE PARABOLIC SUBALGEBRAS OF REDUCTIVE LIE ALGEBRAS                        13


of rank b (note b is l if l is even and l − 1 if l is odd) then the rank of XZX T is
c = min{a, b} if c is even and it is c − 1 if c is odd. In the symplectic case the
generic rank is the minimum of the generic ranks of X and Z (which must be l). 
   We will use the result above to calculate the Jordan forms of specific generic
elements in the next few sections using formula (*) above.
Corollary 3.8. Let x be a generic element in g1 for the standard parabolic subal-
gebra p. If g is of type Cn and the corresponing sequence of block sizes is as in case
(A) or if it is of type Bn or Dn then the Jordan form of x is the same as that of
x′ , a generic element in level 1 of the grade for the sequence of block sizes for slq
with q = 2n for types Cn and Dn and 2n + 1 for type Bn .
   We will conclude this section with some observations that will be used in the
determination of the nice parabolic subalgebras that are given in terms of even
nilpotent elements as in Lemma 2.3.
   Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra over C and let k be a reductive subalgebra
that is reductively embedded (that is the restriction of the adjoint representation
of g to k is completely reducible). Let a be a Cartan subalgebra of k contained in
h, a Cartan subalgebra of g. Then we say that k is evenly embedded in g if the
restriction to a of a root of g on h is in the root lattice of k in a∗ . We note that this
condition is independent of any choices made. We note that if k is an embedded sl2
with standard basis {e, f, h} then k is evenly embedded if and only if e is an even
nilpotent element of g.
   The following lemma is an obvious consequence of the definitions.
Lemma 3.9. Let k be evenly embedded in the semisimple Lie algebra g. Then x ∈ k
is an even nilpotent element of k if and only if it is even as a nilpotent element of
g.
  We apply this result to the classical Lie algebras with the following easy Lemma
that we will leave to the reader.
Lemma 3.10. Standard embeddings of Lie algebras so(n) and sp(n) into sld (with
d = n and d = 2n respectively) are even.

                     4. The proofs of the main theorems.
   In this section we will prove the theorems of section 1. For the exceptional
types the results were proved using the computer program GAP. Our proofs in
the classical cases involve the computation of Jordan forms for generic elements as
described in Proposition 3.3 and Proposition 3.7.
4.1. The case of An . In this subsection we will prove Theorem 1.1. We will first
prove the necessity of the condition. We will use the following result
Theorem 4.1. Let n1 ≥ n2 ≥ ... ≥ nr > 0 define the JordanP form of a nilpotent
matrix in Mn (C) then the dimension of its centralizer is m2i with m1 ≥ m2 ≥
                                                                i
... ≥ ms the dual partition.
   Suppose that there exist i < j < k with ni > nj < nk . We assert that this
implies that there exist l and m such that nl < nl+1 = ... = ni+m > nl+m+1 .
Indeed, let k − i be minimal subject to the condition that there exists i < j < k
such that ni > nj < nk . If there exists s with i < s < j and ns ≥ ni then
14                         KARIN BAUR AND NOLAN WALLACH


ns > nj < nk and k − s < k − i. Thus if i < s < j then ni > ns . If i < s < j and
ns < nj then ni > ns < nj and j − i < k − i. So we must have if i < s < j then
ni > ns ≥ nj . If for such an s we have ns > nj then we have ns > nj < nk . Thus
we have ns = nj . For i < s < j. We can use the same argument to complete the
proof for the interval between j and k.
Lemma 4.2. If g is of type An and if p is the standard parabolic subalgebra of An ,
n ≥ 1 given by integers n1 , ..., nr > 0 with n1 + ... + nr = n + 1. Then if there exist
i < j < k ≤ r with ni > nj < nk then p is not nice.
Proof. The above remarks imply that we may assume that we have
                              n1 > n2 = ... = nm < nm+1 .
Then the above proposition implies that if the Jordan canonical form of a generic
element of g1 has Jordan canonical form with aj blocks of size j for j = 1, ..., m + 1
then am+1 = n2 and ai = 0 for 1 < i < m + 1 and a1 = n1 + nm+1 − 2n2 . The
corresponding partition is
                         m + 1 = ... = m + 1 > 1 = 1 = ... = 1
with n2 , m + 1 and n1 + nm+1 − 2n2 one. The dual partition has one row of length
n1 + nm+1 − n2 and m rows of length n2 . Thus the dimension of the centralizer of
a generic element of g1 in Mn+1 (C) is
     (n1 + nm+1 − n2 )2 + mn22 = 2(n1 − n2 )(nm+1 − n2 ) + n21 + n2m+1 + (m − 1)n22
                               > n21 + n2m+1 + (m − 1)n22 = dim l
with l the standard Levi factor of the corresponding parabolic subalgebra in Mn+1 (C).
Thus Theorem 4.1 implies that p is not nice.                                       

  In light of this lemma the condition of the main theorem for An is necessary.
We now prove that it is sufficient. We will prove the result by induction on r. If
r = 1 there is nothing to prove. The above lemma implies that we may assume
that the ni satisfy one of the following systems of inequalities
                                n1 ≤ ... ≤ nr > 0      (i)

                               n1 ≥ ... ≥ nr > 0      (ii)

                   0 < n1 ≤ ... ≤ nr1 > nr1 +1 ≥ ... ≥ nr > 0      (iii)

Using the Chevalley involution we see that case (i) is nice if and only if case (ii) is
nice. But Proposition 3.3 above implies that in case (ii) the partition corresponding
to the Jordan canonical form of a generic element of g1 is the dual partition to
n1 ≥ ... ≥ nr . PThus the dimension of the centralizer of a generic element in g1
in Mn+1 (C) is n2i . Thus the parabolic subalgebra is indeed nice in these cases.
We now complete the proof by induction. If r ≤ 2 then we are in case (i) or (ii).
We assume the result for r − 1 ≥ 2. We may assume that we are in case (iii).
Applying the Chevalley automorphism we may assume that n1 ≥ nr . The formula
for the Jordan form implies that if i > r − 1 the contribution to the ai of nr cancel
out. Let a′i be the number of blocks of size i for
                          n1 ≤ ... ≤ nr1 > nr1 +1 ≥ ... ≥ nr−1 .

Then a′i = ai for i = 2, ..., r − 2 and a′r−1 = min{n1 .nr−1 }. We also note that
ar−1 = min{n1 , nr−1 } − nr and ar = nr . This implies that a′1 = a1 . Hence the dual
partition for the ai with i = 1, ..., r differs from the dual partition for the a′i with
i = 1, ..., r − 1 by having one additional row which is of length nr . The inductive
hypothesis implies that the sum of the squares of the entries in the dual partition
for the a′i is n21 + ... + n2r−1 and so the sum of the squares for the dual partition for
the ai is n21 + ... + n2r . This completes the proof.
   Actually we have proved that if we have a parabolic subalgebra in the case
An that corresponds to a unimodal sequence n1 , ..., nr and if p is the partition
corresponding to the Jordan form of a generic element of g1 then the dual partition
to p is the ni put in decreasing order.
   The following result follows from the fact that a nilpotent element in sln is even
if and only if all of the block lengths in its Jordan canonical form have the same
parity.
Theorem 4.3. Let p be a nice standard parabolic subalgebra of sln then it corre-
sponds to an even nilpotent element if and only if its sequence of block lengths is
palindromic.
   This result implies that the even nilpotent orbits on sln are in one to one corre-
spondence with the unimodal, palindromic, compositions of n (recall that a compo-
sition of n is a sequence m1 , ..., mr of positive integers such that m1 + ... + mr = n).
Let an denote the number of even nilpotent orbits (0 is considered to be an even
nilpotent orbit) in sln . It is not hard to show that this description implies
Lemma 4.4. The generating function for the an , n≥1 an q n , is

   We note that this combined with the usual classification of even nilpotent orbits
yields

This sequence can be found in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as
number A096441. We note that Euler’s identity (cf. [A] (2.2.5)) says that
                         X        tn             1

                                  i=1            i=0

This implies the above equation also. However, the above method is purely combi-
natorial and implies the special cases t = q and q → q 2 and t = q 2 and q → q 2 .

4.2. The case of Cn . In this subsection we will prove Theorem 1.3. We will use
the following result (cf. [CM]).
Theorem 4.5. Let g be of type C. Let n1 ≥ n2 ≥ ... ≥ nr > 0 be a partition
corresponding the Jordan form of an element x ∈ g then if m1 ≥ ... ≥ ms is the
dual partition then the dimension of gx is

                                   i

     Before we get down to the business at hand we will prove a useful result.
Lemma 4.6. Let the standard parabolic subalgebra, p, for Cn have block sizes r of
size l, s of size m, and r of size l with s and l odd, l < m and n = rl + sm
                                                                           2 viz.

                                  0        0     l×l
Then p is nice if and only if r = 0, 1.
Proof. We will use the main result of the previous section. Let x be a generic
element in g1 . Let ri denote the rank of xi . Our result implies that ri = 2rl+(s−i)m
for i = 1, ..., s, rs+i = (2r − 2i)l + i(l − 1) for i = 1, ..., r and rs+r+i = (r − i)(l − 1)
for i = 1, ..., r. Thus using the method of section one to calculate Jordan forms we
see that the Jordan form of a generic x has l − 1 blocks of size 2r + s, 2 blocks of
size r + s and m − l − 1 blocks of size s.
   The dual partition has s blocks of size m, r blocks of size l + 1 and r blocks of
size l − 1. We therefore see that the dimension of the centralizer of x is
                               sm2                   m

with ξ = 1 if r is even and 0 if r is odd. This number is s−1  2

r − 1 + ξ. If r is even this number is r and if r is odd it is r − 1. The lemma
follows.                                                                         
   We will first show that a standard parabolic subalgebra is nice only if the cor-
responing sequence defining the A2n−1 parabolic is unimodal. So suppose that
we have a standard parabolic subalgebra p corresponding to n1 , ..., nr , nr , ..., n1 in
case (A) or n1 , ..., nr , m, nr , ..., n1 in case (B). We assume that the sequence is not
unimodal and we derive a contradiction. We first consider case (A). Then Corol-
lary 3.8 implies that the Jordan form in question is the same as the one for Aq with
q = 2(n1 + ... + nr ). Let m1 ≥ ... ≥ ms be the corresponding dual partition. If the
sequence n1 , ..., nr , nr , ..., n1 is not unimodal then we have
                            2(n21 + ... + n2r ) < m21 + .... + m2s
by the main theorem for An . This implies that
                                           (m21 + .... + m2s )
                       n21 + ... + n2r <                       ≤ dim gx
                                                   2
so the parabolic is not nice.
   We now look at case (B). We assume that the squence n1 , ..., nr , m, nr , ..., n1 is
not unimodal but the corresponding parabolic subalgebra is nice. Then there must
be a subsequence of the form
                             ns > ns+1 , ..., m, ..., ns+1 < ns
or of the form
                                nr > m < nr .
These correspond to subdiagrams of the diagram for the standard parabolic sub-
algebra. We assert that the corresponding parabolic subalgebra cannot be nice

for the corresponding subalgebra of type Cnr + m2 . Let x be generic in g1 . Then
according to Proposition 3.4
                                  rk(x) = 2m,
                                       rk(x2 ) = m,
                                    rk(x3 ) = 0.
Thus the Jordan canonical form of x has 2nr − 2m blocks of size 1 and m blocks
of size 3. Thus the dual partition is 2nr − m ≥ m = m. So the dimension of gx is
                                   2
                        (2nr − m)                m
                                  + m2 + n r +
                            2                    2
                                                 m(m + 1)
                        = (nr − m)2 + nr + n2r +          .
                                                    2
Since n2r + m(m+1)
              2    is the dimension of the corresponding Levi factor we see that
the corresponding parabolic is not nice. We can thus assume that we have
                           ns > ns+1 , ..., m, ..., ns+1 < ns
as a subsequence. We take s to be maximal with respect to this condition. Then
we must have
                   ns > ns+1 ≤ ... ≤ nr , m, nr ≥ ... ≥ ns+1 < ns
if one of the inequalities nt ≤ nt+1 were strict then the type A result combined
with the subdiagram theorem would imply that the parabolic is not nice. Thus we
may assume that we have
                    ns > ns+1 = .. = nr , m, nr = ... = ns+1 < ns
the relationship between nr and m cannot be nr > m since this yields a subdiagram
that we have just seen cannot be nice. We are thus left with 2 cases
                                 a > b = ... = b < a
or
                        a > b = ... = b < c > b = ... = b < a
where a = ns and in the former case b = m in the latter case n = ns+1 and c = m.
We look at the latter case first. We assume first of all that b is even. Our usual
method of calculation (assuming that there are r b’s and that n = 2rb + 2a + m)
yields
                       dim gx − l = (a − b)(a + 2c + 1 − 3b).
If b is odd then the previous lemma implies that r = 1. Thus we are looking at
                                 a > b < c > b < a.
In this case one finds that the dual partition is 2a + c − 2b ≥ b + 1 = b + 1 > b − 1 =
b − 1. We leave the algebra that shows that this case is not nice to the reader.
   At this point we have shown that unimodality is a necessity for niceness. The
lemma above implies that it is not sufficient. We will devote the rest of the section
to the proof of Theorem 1.3. Let p be a standard parabolic of g with a unimodal
sequence of block lengths. Then if the number of blocks is even or all of the
block lengths are even then Corollary 3.8 implies that the Jordan canonical form
of a generic element in g1 is the same as the Jordan form for the corresponding
parabolic in A2n−1 . Since the sequence is unimodal and palindromic we see that
the element corresponds to an even nilpotent element for A2n−1 and hence for g1 .
18                        KARIN BAUR AND NOLAN WALLACH


Thus in this case the parabolic is nice. We may thus assume that the number of
blocks is odd and the sequence of block sizes is of the form
                 0 < n1 ≤ ... ≤ nr ≤ m ≥ nr ≥ ... ≥ n1 > 0.        (1)
With at least one ni odd. Lemma 4.6 implies that the result is true for r = 1. We
will prove the theorem in this case by induction on r. We will prove that if we have
a sequence as above that corresponds to a nice parabolic and if we extend it by
adding blocks at either end of size n0 yielding
               0 < n0 ≤ n1 ≤ ... ≤ nr ≤ m ≥ nr ≥ ... ≥ n1 ≥ n0 > 0.
Then the new parabolic subalgebra is nice if n0 is even or if n0 is odd and n0 < n1 .
We will show that it is not nice if n0 is odd and n0 = n1 . We will first prove the
positive statements.
   Assume that n0 is even. Let x′ be a generic element of the first level of the
grade for the parabolic subalgebra corresponding to the block sequence (1) and let
x be an element for the block sequence above. Let Rj′ be the rank of (x′ )j and let
Rj be the rank of xj . Then since n0 is even Proposition 3.7 implies that
                        Rj = Rj′ + 2n0 , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r + 1,
                              ′                    ′
                     R2r+2 = R2r+2 + n0 , R2r+j = R2r+j , j > 2.
This if Nj and Nj′ are the respective dimensions of the kernels of xj and (x′ )j we
have
                     Nj = Nj′ , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r + 1,
                          ′                    ′
                 N2r+2 = N2r+2 + n0 , N2r+j = N2r+j + 2n0 , j > 2.
So if the multiplicities in the Jordan forms of x and x′ are respectively Mj and Mj′
then we have
                 Mj = Mj′ , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r,
                       ′                    ′
              M2r+1 = M2r+1 − n0 , M2r+2 = M2r+2 = 0, M2r+3 = n0 .
This implies that the number of odd blocks in the Jordan form is unchanged and
that the only change in the dual partition is the addition of 2 blocks of size n0 .
Thus as in the case of type A the parabolic subalgebra is nice in this case.
  We now consider the case when n0 is odd and n0 < n1 . The argument is similar.
We will use the same notation. We have
                      Rj = Rj′ + 2n0 , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r + 1,
                            ′                       ′
                   R2r+2 = R2r+2 + n0 − 1, R2r+j = R2r+j , j > 2.
Doing the obvious subtraction we have
                   Nj = Nj′ , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r + 1,
                        ′                       ′
               N2r+2 = N2r+2 + n0 + 1, N2r+j = N2r+j + 2n0 , j > 2.
This yields
              Mj = Mj′ , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r,
                  ′                       ′
         M2r+1 = M2r+1 − n0 − 1, M2r+2 = M2r+2 + 2, M2r+3 = n0 − 1.

We therefore see that we have reuced the number of odd blocks by 2 and added 2
blocks to the dual partition of siizes n0 + 1 and n0 − 1. This completes the proof
in this case.
   Finally we assume that n0 is odd and n0 = n1 . We may assume that n1 < n2 by
the inductive hypothesis. We will show that in this case the parabolic subalgebra
is not nice and the proof will be complete. This time we have
                 Rj = Rj′ + 2n0 , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r, R2r+1 = R2r+1
                                                       ′
                                                            + 2(n0 − 1),
                       ′                       ′
              R2r+2 = R2r+2 + n0 − 1, R2r+j = R2r+j , j > 2.
So
                   Nj = Nj′ , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r, N2r+1 = N2r+1
                                                   ′
                                                        + 2,
                         ′                       ′
                N2r+2 = N2r+2 + n0 + 1, N2r+j = N2r+j + 2n0 , j > 2.
Hence
            Mj = Mj′ , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r − 2, M2r−1 = M2r−1
                                                ′             ′
                                                     , M2r = M2r −2=0
                  ′                           ′
         M2r+1 = M2r+1 − n0 + 1 = 0, M2r+2 = M2r+2 = 0, M2r+3 = n0 − 1.
Here we see that there is a net change of two more odd blocks in the Jordan form.
In the dual partition we remove one row of size, n0 − 1 and replace it with one of
size n0 + 1, we then add 2 rows of length n0 − 1 to complete it. Thus the dimension
of the centralizer for x is that of the one for x′ plus

                            −           + (n0 − 1)2 + 1 = n20 + 2.

The inductive hypothesis now implies that the dimension of the centralizer of x is
the dimension of a Levi factor of p plus 2 and the result follows.
   Using Theorem 4.3 we note that the methods of this section allow us to describe
the standard nice parabolic subalgebras coming from even nilpotent elements in the
case of Cn and thereby give a parametrization of the even nilpotent orbits.
Lemma 4.7. The even nilpotent orbits of a Lie algebra of type Cn are in one two
one correspondence with the unimodal, palindromic compositions of 2n which have
the property that if the number of parts is odd then all the parts are even.
4.3. The case of Bn and Dn . In this subsection we will describe the standard
nice parabolic subalgebras in the case when g is an orthogonal Lie algebra that is
of type B or D and thereby prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.4. We will use the following
result (cf. [CM]).
Theorem 4.8. Let g be of type B or D. Let n1 ≥ n2 ≥ ... ≥ nr > 0 be a partition
corresponding the Jordan form of an element x ∈ g then if m1 ≥ ... ≥ ms is the
dual partition then the dimension of gx is
                              P m2i    1
                                  2 − 2 |{i|ni odd}|.
                                i

     We will prove Theorems 1.2 and 1.4 simultaneously in the following form.
Theorem 4.9. Let p be a standard parabolic subgroup of g we consider 4 conditions
on the sequence of its of block lengths.
  1) It is a unimodal sequence with an odd number of elements.
  2) It is a unimodal sequence of even length and each odd block length occurs at
most twice.
20                          KARIN BAUR AND NOLAN WALLACH


     3) The sequence is of the form
                  n1 ≤ .... ≤ nr > nr − 1 = ... = nr − 1 < nr ≥ ... ≥ n1
with the total number of blocks odd and r = 1 or nr−1 < nr .
   4) The sequence is of the form above with the total number of blocks even, the
odd ones occuring at most twice and nr must be odd and at least 3.
   Then p is nice if and only if the sequence satisfies one of the above conditions.

   The proof of this result will take up the rest of the section. We will first prove that
the shapes of the sequences are necessary conditions for niceness. So assume that
we a nice p with block lengths m1 , ..., ms that is not unimodal. Since mj = ms+1−j
we see that If mi ≤ mi+1 for all i ≤ 2s − 1 if s is odd and i ≤ s−1
                                                                  2 if s is odd then the
sequence is unimodal. Thus we may assume that there is j such that mj > mj+1
and j is in the indicated range. If we have mj > mk < ml with j < k < l < u and
u = 2s if s is even, u = s−12 if s is odd then we would have a non-nice type type
A subdiagram of the diagram of p. Taking the j with mj > mj+1 in the indicted
range to be as big as possible we see that there must be central subsequences of
one of the following forms (even and odd correspond to the number of blocks, thus
(1) in the even cases means that there are an even number of b’s):
   Even Cases:

                              (1)       a > b = ... = b < a.
                    (2)     a > b = ... = b < c = c > b = ... = b < a.
     Odd Cases:
                             (1)     a > b = ... = b < a.
                     (2)     a > b = ... = b < c > b = ... = b < a.
We will show that the diagrams of type (2) are never nice and those of type (1) are
nice if and only if and a = b + 1 and if there are an even number of blocks then b is
even. We first look at the case of b even we are in the even type (1) case so there
are 2l, b’s. Then applying Proposition 3.5 we see that if x is a generic element in
the degree 1 part of the grade and if Ri is the rank of xi then

       R1 = (2l + 1)b, R2 = 2lb, R3 = (2l − 1)b, ..., R2l+1 = b, Rj = 0, j > 2l + 1.
The dimension of ker xi will be denoted Ni . We find that
N1 = 2a−b, N2 = 2a, N3 = 2a+b, ..., N2l+1 = 2a+(2l−1)b, Nj = 2a+2lb, j > 2l+1.
From this we find that the Jordan canonical form has 2(a − b) blocks of size 1 and
b blocks of size 2l + 2 This implies that the Jordan form of x is 2a − b, b, ..., b with
2l + 1 b’s. The sequence of block lengths has 2(a − b) odd parts thus
                                 (2a − b)2   2l + 1 2
                          dim gx =         +       b − a + b.
                                     2          2
If m is the standard Levi factor of p then dim m = a2 + lb2 . A direct calculation
yields that
                        dim gx − dim m = (a − b)(a − b − 1).
This says that in this case the parabolic subalgebra is nice if and only if a = b + 1.
We next look at type 1 with an odd number of blocks then the argument is identical
(since in the odd case the parity of b plays no role. We conclude the analysis of
           NICE PARABOLIC SUBALGEBRAS OF REDUCTIVE LIE ALGEBRAS                      21


the type one cases by looking at the even case with with b odd and showing that
this cannot correspond to a nice parabolic subalgebra. To simplify the calculation
we first show that the case when we have blocks b, b, b, b with b odd is not nice.
Indeed, in this case we have
                   R1 = 3b − 1, R2 = 2b − 2, R3 = b − 1, R4 = 0.
Thus
                       M1 = 0, M2 = 2, M3 = 0, M4 = b − 1.
If b = 1 then the dual partition is 2, 2 so dim gx − dim m = 2. If b > 1 then the dual
partition is b + 1, b + 1, b − 1, b − 1 and we have dim gx − dim m = 2. This proves our
assertion. If we use Lemma 2.4 then we are reduced to proving that the parabolic
with block lengths a > b = b < a is not nice if b is odd. In this case we have
                   R1 = 3b − 1, R2 = 2b − 2, R3 = b − 1, R4 = 0.
This yields
                    M1 = 2a − 2b, M2 = 2, M3 = 0, M4 = b − 1.
If b = 1 then the dual partition is
                             2a − b + 1, b + 1, b − 1, b − 1.
Hence we have
                    dim gx − dim m = (a − b)2 + a − b + 2 > 2.
This proves the result in this case.
    We are thus left with analyzing the type (2) cases. When there are an even
number of parts then there are 4 cases (i) b, c even,(ii) c even, b odd,(iii) c odd,b
even and (iv) b, c odd. We will not bore the reader by going through all of the 4
type (2) even cases and the one type (2) odd case. We will do enough that the
reader should have no trouble checking the missing cases. Recall that we are trying
to prove that all of these cases are not nice. We look at the odd case (2) first. In
this case we have
                                 Rj = (2l + 3 − j)b.
¿From this we see that the corresponding Jordan form has 2a − 3b + c blocks of size
1 and b blocks of size 2l + 3. The dual partition is one block of size 2a − 2b + c and
2l + 2 blocks of size b. Thus
                             (2a − 2b + c)2                      c
                  dim gx =                  + (l + 1)b2 − a + b − .
                                   2                             2
The dimension of the corresponding Levi factor is a2 + lb2 + c(c−1)2 . One checks
easily that the dimension of gx is strictly larger than the dimension of the Levi
factor.
   We now look at the even cases. We first look at the case when b and c are even
and the number of b’s is 2l (thus the total length is 2l + 4). Then
               R1 = (2l + 2)b + c, Ri = (2l + 4 − i)b, 2 ≤ i ≤ 2l + 4.
This leads to a Jordan form with 2a − 2b ones,c − b twos and b blocks of size 2l + 4.
The dual partition has one block of size 2a − 2b + c, one block of size c and 2l + 2
of size b. The dimension of a Levi factor is a2 + lb2 + c2 and the dimension of gx is
                     (2a − 2b + c) (c − b)
                                  +        + (l + 1)b2 − a + b
                           2          2
22                          KARIN BAUR AND NOLAN WALLACH


the difference is (a−b)(a+2c−3b−1) ≥ 2(a−b) > 0. Thus the parabolic subalgebra
is not nice as asserted. If c is odd and b is even then the only change in the ranks
is R1 = (2l + 2)b + c − 1. We leave it to the reader to show that the parabolic
subalgebra is not nice in this case. We will now look at b, c odd. Then we have
                  R1 = (2l + 2)b + c − 1,   R2 = (2l + 2)b,
                  Rj = (2l − 2(j − 3))b + (j − 2)(b − 1), 2 < j ≤ l + 3,
                  Rj = (2l + 4 − j)(b − 1), l + 4 ≤ j ≤ 2l + 4.
From this we find that the corresponding Jordan form has 2a − 2b + 2 blocks of size
1, c − b − 2 blocks of size 2, 2 blocks of size l + 3 and b − 1 blocks of size 2l + 4.
The number of odd blocks is 2a − 2b + 2 + 2ξ with ξ = 1 if l is even and ξ = 0 if l
is odd. The dual partition has one block of size 2a + c − 2b + 1, one block of size
c − 1, l + 1 blocks of size b + 1 and l + 1 blocks of size b − 1. We therefore have
             (2a − 2b + c + 1)2   (c − 1)2
     dim gx =                   +          + (l + 1)(b2 + 1) − a + b − ξ
                     2                2
           = 2a2 − 4ab + 2b2 + 2(a − b)(c + 1) + c2 + 1 + lb2 + b2 + l − a + b − ξ
           = a2 − 4ab + 3b2 + 2(a − b)c + (1 − ξ) + l + a2 + lb2 + c2
           = (a − b)2 + 2(a − b)(c − b) + (1 − ξ) + l + a2 + 2lb + c2 .
Since the dimension of the corresponding Levi factor is a2 + 2lb + c2 the correspond-
ing parabolic subalgebra is not nice. If c is even and b is odd the only change in
the ranks is R1 = (2l + 2)b + c. We leave this case for the reader.
   We conclude that if a parabolic subalgebra is nice and the corresponding sequence
of block sizes not unimodal then it must contain the following in the middle
                                b + 1 > b = .. = b < b + 1
with b even if the number of terms is even. We now prove that under these
conditions on b and the number of blocks the parabolic corresponding to
                            a ≥ b + 1 > b = .. = b < b + 1 ≤ a
is not nice. Let s be the number of b’s, One checks that
                R1 = 2(b + 1) + (s + 1)b, Rj = (s + 4 − j)a, 2 ≤ j ≤ s + 4.
This implies that the corresponding Jordan form one block of size 2(a − b − 1)
(unless this number is 0) has 2 blocks of size 2 and b blocks of size s + 4. Thus
the dual partition is one block of size 2a − b one of size b + 2 (notice that these
are the same if a = b + 1) and b with multiplicity s + 2. Thus the dimension of gx
          2         2
is (2a−b)
      2     + (b+2)
                 2    + s+2 2                b
                         2 b − (a − b − 1) − 2 ξ with ξ = 0 if s is even and ξ = 1 if
s is odd. The dimension of the corresponding Levi factor is 2(b + 1)2 + 2s b2 − 2b ξ.
The difference is 2 + (a − b)(a − b − 1) so the parabolic subalgebra is not nice as
asserted. We leave it to the reader to check that if a is as above and a < b + 1
then the parabolic subalgebra is nice.
    We will prove the theorem by induction on the number of elements in the se-
quence of block lengths. We will first consider the unimodal case we will show that
if the number of blocks is odd then the corresponding parabolic subalgebra is nice.
If the number of blocks is even then the corresponding parabolic subalgebra is nice
if and only if each odd block occurs at most twice. We will prove this by induction
on the number of blocks. If the number of blocks is one then the corresponding
           NICE PARABOLIC SUBALGEBRAS OF REDUCTIVE LIE ALGEBRAS                    23


parabolic subalgebra is the whole Lie algebra and the result is obvious. If the num-
ber of blocks is 2 then the corresponding parabolic subalgebra has commutative
nilradical so is nice. Assume that we have proved the result for r ≥ 1 blocks. If we
take such a unimodal nice parabolic subalgebra with sequence
                                     0 < n1 ≤ ... ≥ n1 > 0
and we adjoin a block at both ends a block of size n0 ≤ n1 then we will show that
if r is odd then the corresponding parabolic subalgebra is nice and if r is even then
it is nice if n0 is even or if it is odd it is nice if and only if n0 < n1 . We first
assume that r is odd or n0 is even. We will use arguments similar to those for the
case of type C. We will use the primed notation in the same way as in the previous
section. We find that
                              Ri = Ri′ + 2n0 , 1 ≤ i ≤ r,
                                        ′
                                                       ′
                            Rr+1 = Rr+1 + n0 , Rr+2 = Rr+2 .
Thus the multiplicities in the Jordan form are
                                 Mi = Mi′ for i ≤ r − 1,
                 Mr = Mr′ − n0 , Mr+1 = Mr+1
                                         ′
                                             = 0, Mr+2 = n0 .
This implies that the corresponding dual partition is obtained by adjoining two rows
of length n0 to the original partition. Thus we have added n20 to the dimension of
the centralizer and the same to the dimension of the Levi factor so the parabolic
subalgebra is nice in this case. We now assume that n0 is odd and n0 < n1 . In
this case we have
                       Ri = Ri′ + 2n0 , 1 ≤ i ≤ r,
                                 ′
                                                  ′
                    Rr+1 = Rr+1 + n0 − 1, Rr+2 = Rr+2 = 0.
The multiplicities for the Jordan form are given by
                                 Mi = Mi′ for i ≤ r − 1,
           Mr = Mr′ − n0 − 1, Mr+1 = Mr+1
                                      ′
                                          + 2 = 2, Mr+2 = n0 − 1.
This time we change the dual partition by adjoining a row of length n0 − 1 and one
of length n0 + 1. In the Jordan form we have added to rows of odd length. So we
find that the parabolic subalgebra is nice since the dimension of the Levi factor is
the same as the centralizer.
   To complete the unimodal case we must show that if r is even n0 is odd and
n0 = n1 then the parabolic subalgebra is not nice. We note that by the inductive
hypothesis we must have n1 < n2 . As above we have
                Ri = Ri′ + 2n0 , 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1, Rr = Rr′ + 2(n0 − 1),
                        ′
                                            ′
              Rr+1 = Rr+1 + n0 − 1, Rr+2 = Rr+2 = 0.
This yields multiplicities in the Jordan form:
                Mi = Mi′ for i ≤ r − 2, Mr−1 = Mr−1
                                                ′
                                                    − 2 = 0,
               Mr = Mr′ − n0 + 3 = 2, Mr+1 = 0, Mr+2 = n0 − 1.
The upshot is two rows of length r − 1 are lost and the original last row in the
dual partition is replaced by a row of length n0 + 1 and one row is added of length
24                       KARIN BAUR AND NOLAN WALLACH


n0 − 1. The upshot is that the dimension of the centralizer is two more than that
of the Levi factor. We have completed the argument in this case.
   We now look at the non-unimodal case. Here we have seen that the sequence
must contain
                            b + 1 > b = ... = b < b + 1
with b even if the number of terms is even or
                         a < b + 1 > b = ... = b < b + 1 > a
with b even if the number of terms is even. Now using the results for type A we
see that if we have a general nonunimodal sequence and not just of the above two
forms it must be of the form
        n1 ≤ ... ≤ nr ≤ a < b + 1 > b = ... = b < b + 1 > a ≥ nr ≥ ... ≥ n1
with b even if the number of blocks is even. Now exactly the same argument as
in the unimodal case proves that the conditions 3),4) of the theorem are necessary
and sufficient.
   Using Theorem 4.3 we note that the methods of this section allow us to describe
the standard nice parabolic subalgebras coming from even nilpotent elements in the
case of so(n) and thereby give a parametrization of the even nilpotent orbits.
Lemma 4.10. The even nilpotent orbits of so(n) are in one-to-one correspondence
with the unimodal, palindromic compositions of n which have the property that if
the number of parts is even then all the block sizes are even.
4.4. The exceptional cases. In this subsection we will explain how to derive
the tables for the exceptional Lie algebras. In the case of G2 , Lemma 2.3 and
Corollary 2.2 already give the classification of nice parabolic subalgebras. For F4
there are eight parabolic subalgebras that are given by a TDS and seven parabolic
subalgebras that are not nice by the dimension criterion Corollary 2.2. The only
remaining case is (1, 0, 0, 1). One uses Corollary 2.6 to show that this parabolic
subalgebra is not nice: The corresponding Levi factor has dimension 12. The
only nilpotent element in the Bala-Carter table (cf. [C], p. 401) that has a 12-
dimensional centralizer satisfies dim m = dim g1 , i.e. is a distinguished nilpotent.
But the grading associated to (1, 0, 0, 1) gives a much smaller dimension for g1 .
Hence, this parabolic subalgebra is not nice.
Remark 4.11. Observe that for G2 and F4 , the nice parabolic subalgebras are
exactly those given by an even TDS.
   The most complicated case is En . We describe the steps that led to the classifi-
cation (cf. list in Section 1).
   First step: Use the dimension criterion (Corollary 2.2). There remain 37, 46
resp. 40 parabolic subalgebras of E6 , E7 , resp. of E8 . We used Mathematica to
check the dimensions of the graded parts.
   In a second step, one identifies all parabolic subalgebras that are given by a TDS
(10 for E6 , 24 for E7 and 46 for E8 ). They can be found using the tables of nilpotent
orbits in [C], pp. 402-407.
   Thirdly, the subdiagram result (Lemma 2.4) gives sixteen more nice parabolic
subalgebras for E6 . It also excludes a couple of parabolics for all E-types that have
a bad subdiagram (of type Dn , n = 4, 5, 6, 7).
            NICE PARABOLIC SUBALGEBRAS OF REDUCTIVE LIE ALGEBRAS                             25


   After that, there remain 30 parabolic subalgebras of E-types. For all these para-
bolic subalgebras, one calculates the dimension of the Levi factor. By Theorem 2.5,
this is the same as the dimension of the centralizer for a Richardson element. In a
case-by-case study, one checks whether there is a nilpotent element in g1 whose sta-
bilizer has the required dimension. This can be done using the Computer Algebra
Program GAP:
Remark 4.12. The GAP-program uses the function ‘random’
                                                      P         to generate a generic
element x ∈ g1 , namely it produces an element x = α∈g1 cα Xα where all cα are
nonzero. Generic means that the dimension dim mx of the centralizer of x in the
Levi factor m equals dim m − dim g1 .
   The program tests whether x is generic and then calculates the dimension dim gx
of the centralizer of x in g. By Theorem 2.5, p is nice if and only if this dimension
equals m.
Remark 4.13. We came to the same list by hand. This involved studying the
roots of g1 using a variety of different methods.
  The complete list of nice parabolic subalgebras in type E consists of 30 parabolic

                     5. Nilpotent elements, a normal form
   In this section, we introduce a normal form for Richardson elements in g1 . We
will not give any proofs given that the paper is already long. In a separate paper
([B]), the first named author is discussing this normal form for the nilpotent ele-
ments in more detail and explains the weight structure of the representation g1 of
m.
   Let p ⊂ g be a nice parabolic subalgebra of a classical Lie algebra. We will show
how to choose a Richardson element in g1 that projects into only the root spaces
for the roots in a small set S1 . For each type of a parabolic subalgebra p in type
A, B, C, D we give a recipe that picks this set of g1 .
   We view the classical Lie algebras in the corresponding glN (N = n + 1, 2n +
1, 2n, 2n for types A, B, C, D). If αij , i < j, is a positive root for glN , then the
standard matrix with a 1 in the i, j position and zeros everywhere else, Eij , is a
basis for the root space gαij .
   Recall that the sequence of the block lengths of the standard Levi factor are of
the form (a1 , . . . , ar+1 ) for sln+1 . For the other classical Lie algebras, they are of
the form (a1 , . . . , ar , ar , . . . , a1 ) (even number of blocks, (A)-case) or of the form
(a1 , . . . , ar , ar+1 , ar , . . . , a1 ) (odd number of blocks, (B)-case) respectively. These
sequences give rise to a block decomposition of the first super-diagonal (cf. dis-
cussion above Lemma 3.6). We thus obtain r subsets of the positive roots. More
precisely, the roots of g1 are divided into r subsets.

   We can think of the roots of such a subset as filling out a rectangle of size
ai × ai+1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1 (resp. i ≤ r in the (B)-case) and of size ar × ar in the
(A)-case. We denote these rectangles by Ri,i+1 (i ≤ r). Note that the central one
in the (A)-case is a square matrix of size ar × ar that is symmetric if the Lie algebra
is symplectic and skew-symmetric if g is an orthogonal Lie algebra. The entries of
a rectangle Ri,i+1 will be labeled by (k, l), 1 ≤ k ≤ ai+1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ ai , starting with
(1, 1) in the lower left corner and ending with (ai+1 , ai ) in the upper right corner.
Every such entry (k, l) corresponds uniquely to a positive root αik ,jl of glN since
every entry (k, l) of such a rectangle corresponds uniquely to a matrix entry Eik ,jl .
Remark 5.1. Our choice of the subset S1 of the roots of g1 has to do with the
weight structure of the representation of the Levi factor on the space g1 . The
subsets S1 are related to our initial proofs of the theorems. Especially, they play a
role in our first theoretical approach to the exceptional case.
Remark 5.2. Using Proposition 3.7 one checks that the constructed nilpotent
                                 j
element is generic (that is the XR have generic rank). So the constructed matrix
XR is a Richardson element for p in g1
5.1. Case An . Let p be a nice parabolic subalgebra of sln+1 . Let (a1 , . . . , ar+1 ) be
the sequence of the block lengths of the standard Levi factor of p. By Theorem 1.1
this sequence is unimodal, so a1 ≤ · · · ≤ as ≥ · · · ≥ ar+1 . We will now give the
subset S1 of the sets of roots of g1 by explicitely describing the needed roots for
each rectangle Ri,i+1 .
Recipe 5.3. (1a) If i is odd we choose the entries (1, 1), (2, 2), . . . , (ai , ai ) of the
rectangle Ri,i+1 .
   (1b) If i is even we choose entries (ai+1 , ai ), (ai+1 −1, ai −1), . . . , (ai+1 −ai +1, 1)
of Ri,i+1 .
   (2) The subset S1 of the roots of g1 is then the union of all roots corresponding
to the chosen entries.                                              P
   (3) We define the nilpotent element XR to be the matrix α∈S1 Eα .
   The result is a nilpotent matrix that has r small boxes, one in each of the
rectangles Ri,i+1 . The small boxes consist of skew-diagonal matrices as shown in
the following example.
Example 5.4. The parabolic subalgebra (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1) of A6 , i.e. p is given by the
sequence (1, 2, 3, 1) of block length of the standard Levi factor. The normal form
of the Richardson   element is
                 ∗   1
                                  
                    ∗   ∗           1    
                     ∗   ∗       1
                                         
                                         
     XR :=   
                            ∗   ∗   ∗    .
                                          
             
                            ∗   ∗   ∗    
                                          
                            ∗   ∗   ∗   1
                                         ∗
     The roots that are chosen are α1 , α2 + α3 + α4 , α6 , α3 + α4 .
Remark 5.5. In Example 4.6 of [GR] Röhrle and Goodwin describe Richardson
elements of g1 for parabolic subalgebras of glN . They follow a construction given
by [BHRR]. The method amounts to choose an identity matrix of size min{ai , ai+1 }
in each rectangle Ri,i+1 , starting with entry (1, ai ). The two methods are equivalent.
Our approach is motivated by the construction for the other classical Lie algebras
as we will see.

5.2. Case Cn . Here, the pattern is slightly different. Either there is an even num-
ber of blocks in the standard Levi factor ((A)-case) or an odd number ((B)-case).
In the first case the recipe is essentially the same as for sln+1 . In the second case
we modify Recipe 5.3. We divide the chosen entries into two sets, choosing half
of them starting with entry (1, 1) and the other half starting with entry (ai+1 , ai ).
Let bi := ⌊ a2i ⌋ and Bi := ⌈ a2i ⌉.
Recipe 5.6. (1A) For i ≤ r we do the same as in Recipe 5.3. In particular, in
rectangle Rr,r+1 we choose all entries on the skew-diagonal, i.e. (1, 1), . . . , (ar , ar ).
     (1B) If i is odd, we choose the entries (1, 1), . . . , (Bi , Bi ) and the entries (ai+1 , ai ),
. . . , (ai+1 − bi + 1, ai − bi + 1) of the rectangle Ri,i+1 . If i is even, we choose the
entries (1, 1), . . . , (bi , bi ) and the entries (ai+1 , ai ), . . . , (ai+1 − bi , ai − bi ).
     (2) The subset S1 of the roots of g1 is the union of all roots that correspond to
the chosen entries.
     (3) We define the nilpotent element XR to be the following matrix: If αij (with
i ≤ n) is an element of S1 , then the matrix XR has entry 1 at position (i, j) and
the correspond entry at its adjoint position: It has entry −1 at position (2n − j +
1, 2n − i + 1) if j > n and entry 1 at position (2n − j + 1, 2n − i + 1) if j ≤ n.
   It is clear that this is a matrix of sp2n .

                                                     = 8. Thus the partition of XR is
        (2, 2, 3, 3), with one pair of odd entries. The dual partition is (4, 4, 2). This
        gives dim gXR = 21 (16 + 16 + 4) + 1 = 19 (cf. Theorem 4.5 which is equal
        to dim m.

         12. Thus the partition is (2, 2, 4, 4), which is equal to its dual partition. So
         dim gXR = 12 (16 + 16 + 4 + 4) = 20. The Levi factor also has dimension 20.

Remark 5.8. In the construction for the special orthogonal case, there are some
adaptions of the recipe: If there is an even number of blocks, i.e. in the (A)-case,
and ai > ai+1 for some i, we pick ai+1 roots for Ri,i+1 . In the (B)-case we choose
twice Bi := ⌈ a2i ⌉ entries in each rectangle Ri,i+1 if the parities of ai and of ai+1 are
different.
   Recall that bi := ⌊ a2i ⌋ and Bi := ⌈ a2i ⌉. To deal with non-unimodal sequences we
introduce si := min{ai , ai+1 }.
Recipe 5.9. (1A) Let the number of blocks in the standard Levi factor be even.
   Let i ≤ r + 1. For odd i we choose entries (1, 1), . . . , (si , si ) in rectangle Ri,i+1 .
For even i we choose entries (ai+1 , ai ), . . . , (ai+1 − si + 1, ai − si + 1) of the rectangle
Ri,i+1 .                                                                      
   In rectangle Rr,r+1 we choose br two-by-two matrices 10 −1              0
                                                                              on the skew-
diagonal, starting at (1, 1) if r is odd or at (ar , ar ) if r is even. Cf. Example 5.11.
   (1B) For each rectangle Ri,i+1 we pick the entries (1, 1), . . . , (Bi , Bi ) and the
entries (ai+1 , ai ), . . . , (ai+1 − bi , ai − bi ). As an illustration, see Example 5.10
below and Example 5.12.
   (2) The set S1 is the union of all roots aij that correspond to the chosen entries.
   (3) The nilpotent element XR is the following matrix: If αij ∈ S1 then XR has
entry 1 at position (i, j) and entry −1 at the position adjoint to (i, j): at position
(2n − j + 2, 2n − i + 2) in the case of so2n+1 resp. at (2n − j + 1, 2n − i + 1) in the
case of so2n .
     Example 5.12 treats non-unimodal cases.
Example 5.10. We present the constructed nilpotent element for parabolic sub-
algra of B4 where the sequence of block lengths is unimodal and consists of an odd
number of blocks. The parabolic subalgebra of B4 is (0, 1, 0, 0), with block lengths
(2, 5, 2).

(3, 3, 3, 1, 1) with five odd parts. The dual partition is (5, 3, 3), and so dim gXR =

  We have dim ker XR = 4, dim ker XR    = 6 and dim ker XR     = 8, dim ker XR   = 10.
The Jordan form is given by the partition (1, 1, 4, 4) with dual partition (4, 2, 2, 2).
So the centralizer of XR has dimension 13 which is equal to dim m.

Remark 5.13. In the (A)-cases, type B, D Recipe 5.9 chooses more roots than
we do in the other case. We know that there are example where this is necessary,
e.g. the parabolic subalgebra of D11 with block lengths (1, 3, 5, 4, 5, 3, 1). Here,
one needs the “extra” roots chosen in R1,2 and in R2,3 . If we choose only the
commuting roots according to the recipe for type C (Recipe 5.6) we obtain a nilpo-
                      ′
       ′
tent XR   with dim gXR > 41 while dim m = 41. On the other hand, if there are
only odd sized blocks, as in Example 5.10, there is a way to choose one entry less
per rectangle Ri,i+1 . In Example 5.10 one can alternatively choose (2, 1), (3, 2)
and (4, 3) in R1,2 . Also, if r = 2, we can use part (1B) of Recipe 5.6 instead of
(1B) in Recipe 5.9. These phenomena are discussed in detail in [B] where the first
named author describes the properties of the roots involved in the construction of
Richardson elements.
