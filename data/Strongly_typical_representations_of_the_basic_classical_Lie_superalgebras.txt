                                                    Abstract. We describe the category of representations with a strongly typical central
                                                    character of a basic classical Lie superalgebra in terms of representations of its even part.




                                                                                      1. Introduction

                                             1.1. In [PS1], I. Penkov and V. Serganova show that the category of representations
                                             of a basic classical Lie superalgebra g of type I with a fixed typical central character is
                                             equivalent to the category of representations of the even part g0 with a suitable central
                                             character. A similar result for type II was proven by I. Penkov in [P] for “generic” central
                                             characters. The aim of this paper is to understand for which central characters such an
                                             equivalence holds. We also study a simplest example when such an equivalence fails to
                                             exist, but the corresponding category of representations of a Lie superalgebra still has a
                                             good description.

                                             1.2. The basic classical Lie superalgebras were described by V. Kac in [K1]. These Lie
                                             superalgebras are the closest to the ordinary simple Lie algebras: for instance, they can
                                             be described by their Cartan matrices. The even part of a basic classical Lie superalgebra
                                             g is a reductive Lie algebra. The centre Z(g) is described in [K2], [S1], [BZV]; it is
                                             isomorphic to a subalgebra of S(h)W and their fields of fractions coincide (here h is a
                                             Cartan subalgebra of g0 and W is the Weyl group of g0 ).

                                             1.3. Let g = g0 ⊕ g1 be a basic classical Lie superalgebra, Ue be its universal enveloping
                                             superalgebra and Z(g) be the centre of Ue . Let T be a special ghost element constructed
                                             in [G1]— see 2.3. We call a maximal ideal χe of Z(g) strongly typical if it does not contain
                                             T 2.
                                                                                               f set N
                                                 For a maximal ideal χe of Z(g) and a g-module N     f := {v ∈ N| f χer v = 0, ∀r >> 0}.

                                             For a fixed χe ∈ Max Z(g), denote by gr Cer the category of graded g-modules N  f satisfying
                                                 f = 0 and by gr Ce the category of graded g-modules N
                                             χer N                                                       f satisfying N
                                                                                                                      f =N   f.
                                                                   ∞                                                     e
                                                                                                                         χ

                                               Consider g0 as a purely even Lie superalgebra. Denote by U its enveloping algebra and
                                             by Z(g0 ) the centre of U. For a maximal ideal χ of Z(g0 ) and a g0 -module N define Nχ

as above. For a fixed χ ∈ Z(g0 ), denote by gr C r the category of graded g0 -modules N
                                                                                       f
satisfying χr N = 0 and by gr C ∞ the category of graded g0 -modules N satisfying Nχ = N.
In Sect. 3 we prove the following

1.3.1. Theorem. For a strongly typical χe ∈ Max Z(g) the category gr Ce∞ is equivalent
to the category gr C ∞ where χ is a suitable maximal ideal of Z(g0 ). The equivalence is
given by the functors
                             f 7→ N
                             N     f,      N 7→ (Indgg0 N)χe.
                                     χ

The restriction of these functors provide also the equivalence of gr Cer with gr C r .
  A maximal ideal χ ∈ Max Z(g0 ) is suitable in the sense of the above theorem iff for
some projective Verma g-module M    f satisfying χeMf = 0, the g -module M f is Verma and,
                                                                0            χ
moreover, one has M   f = Ue M
                             f . Note that if χ is a perfect mate for χ
                                                                      e in the sense of [G2],
                               χ
then it fulfills these conditions. In [G2], Sect.8 we prove the existence of a perfect mate
χ for each strongly typical χe ∈ Max Z(g). This allows one to describe the category gr Ce∞
corresponding to any strongly typical χe in terms of Theorem 1.3.1.
   The proof is based on the theorem stating that for a strongly typical χe the annihilator
of a Verma g-module M  f satisfying χ
                                    eMf = 0 is equal to Ue χ—
                                                           e  see [G2].
   An analogue of Theorem 1.3.1 for the basic classical Lie superalgebras of type I is proven
in [PS1]; for “generic” χe in type II case, it is proven in [P]. Both proofs are based on a
realization of the categories gr Ce1 , gr C 1 as categories of D-modules on the corresponding
flag varieties.

1.4. Theorem 1.3.1 suggests a study of categories of representations of g corresponding
to a non strongly typical character χ.
                                     e Call such χ  e weakly atypical. If χ
                                                                          e is not typical,
               e
the category C ∞ has a very complicated structure— for instance, it contains non-trivial
extensions of non-isomorphic finite dimensional modules. An “intermediate” case, when
χe is typical but not strongly typical (it is possible only for the types B(m, n), G(3)),
seems to be less complicated. We consider the case when g = osp(1, 2l) (B(0, 2l)) and the
maximal ideal is a “generic” weakly atypical (see the condition (10)). This means that
the highest weight λ of a highest weight module annihilated by m belongs to exactly one
of the hyperplanes Sβ , β ∈ ∆+                      ∗
                             1 where Sβ := {µ ∈ h | (µ + ρ, β) = 0}.

   It is convenient to substitute the maximal ideal m of Z(g) by the maximal ideal χe of
                     e
the “ghost centre” Z(g)   (see [G1] for definition) which contains m. For g = osp(1, 2l) one
      e
has Z(g) = Z(g) ⊕ T Z(g) and the ideal χe := m ⊕ T Z(g) is a maximal ideal of Z(g).    e
Define the categories gr Cer and gr Ce∞ for such χe ∈ Max Z(g)
                                                            e    in the same way as it was
done above for χ ∈ Max Z(g). For fixed χ, denote by C r the category of non-graded
                  e
g0 -modules N satisfying χr N = 0 and by C ∞ the full subcategory of the category of
non-graded g0 -modules consisting of the modules N satisfying Nχ = N.   f

    Under the above assumption on m, we prove in Sect. 4 the following
                                                                                            3




1.4.1. Theorem.        The category gr Ce∞ is equivalent to the category C ∞ where χ is a
suitable maximal ideal of Z(g0 ). The equivalence is given by the functors
                            f 7→ N
                            N    f ∩N
                                    f,          N 7→ (Indgg0 N)χe
                                  χ  0

where the grading on Indgg0 N is determined by the assuming N to be even.
  The restriction of these functors provide also the equivalence of gr Cer with C r .
  A maximal ideal χ ∈ Max Z(g0 ) is suitable in the sense of the above theorem iff for
some projective Verma g-module M   f satisfying χ
                                                eMf = 0, the g -module M := M    f ∩M f is
                                                                0                 χ    0
Verma and M  f = Ue M. In 4.5.3 we construct such a suitable ideal χ for each m ∈ Max Z(g)
satisfying the above assumption.
  The proof is based on the theorem stating that the annihilator of a Verma g-module M   f
satisfying mMf = 0 is equal to Ue χ
                                  e (see [GL1], 6.2) and on Proposition 4.7 which describes
                           f  f
the locally finite part F (M, M ) of endomorphisms of a Verma module M      f through the
image of Ue in it.

                                    2. Preliminaries

   Everywhere in the paper g = g0 ⊕g1 denotes one (unless otherwise specified, an arbitrary
one) of the basic classical complex Lie superalgebras gl(m, n), sl(m, n), osp(m, n), psl(n, n).
Each of these Lie superalgebras possesses the following properties: it admits a g-invariant
bilinear form which is non-degenerate on [g, g] and the even part g0 is a reductive Lie
algebra.

2.1. Conventions. In this paper the ground field is C. We denote by N+ the set of
positive integers. If A is an algebra, N is an A-module and X, Y are subsets of A and
N respectively, we denote by XY the submodule spanned by the products xy where
x ∈ X, y ∈ Y .
   For a Z2 -homogeneous element u of a superalgebra denote by d(u) its Z2 -degree. In all
formulae where this notation is used, u is assumed to be Z2 -homogeneous.
   For a Lie superalgebra m denote by U(m) its universal enveloping algebra and by S(m)
its symmetric algebra. All modules in the text are assumed to be left modules unless
otherwise specified. An m-module N is called locally finite if dim U(m)v < ∞ for all
v ∈ N. Set Ue := U(g) and U := U(g0 ).

2.2. Fix a triangular decomposition g = n− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ — see [PS2] for definition. Denote
by ∆ the set of all non-zero roots of g and by ∆+            +
                                                 0 (resp., ∆1 ) the set of non-zero positive
                                    +
even (resp., odd) roots of g. Set ∆1 := {β ∈ ∆+            +
                                                1 | 2β 6∈ ∆0 }. and

    Let W be the Weyl group of g0 . For w ∈ W, µ ∈ h∗ set
                                     w.µ = w(µ + ρ) − ρ.
Denote by (−, −) a g-invariant bilinear form on g which is non-degenerate on [g, g] and
                                                             +
also the induced W -invariant bilinear form on h∗ . One has ∆1 = {β ∈ ∆+
                                                                       1 | (β, β) = 0}.



2.3.   Define the adjoint action of g on Ue by setting
                        (ad g)u = gu − (−1)d(g)d(u) ug, ∀g ∈ g, u ∈ Ue

By default, the action of g on Ue is assumed to be the adjoint action. The centre Z(g) of
Ue is equal to Ue ad g.
    Define the twisted adjoint action of g on Ue by setting

                      (ad′ g)u = gu − (−1)d(g)(d(u)+1) ug, ∀g ∈ g, u ∈ Ue .
                               ′
The anticentre A(g) := Ue ad g contains an element T defined in [G1]. This is a unique
                                      Q
element of A(g) satisfying P(T )(λ) = β∈∆+ (β, λ + ρ) for any λ ∈ h∗ ; here P : Ue → S(h)
                                           1
is the Harish-Chandra projection. The element T is even. Since T belongs to A(g), it
commutes with the even elements of Ue and anticommutes with the odd ones; in particular,
T 2 ∈ Z(g).
  The Harish-Chandra projection P provides a monomorphism ι : Z(g) → S(h)W. . The
image of ι is described in [K2], [S1], [BZV]; ι is bijective iff g = osp(1, 2l). The centre
Z(g) contains an element Q such that
                                                   Y
                                   P(Q)(λ) =           (β, λ + ρ).

The localized algebra Z(g)[T −2 ] is isomorphic to a localization of a polynomial algebra
S(h)W by P(Q)—see [K3]. The localized algebra Z(g)[T −2 ] is isomorphic to a localization
of a polynomial algebra S(h)W .

2.4. The category O      e and Verma modules. Denote by O the full subcategory of the
category of g0 -modules consisting of finitely generated h-diagonalizable g0 -modules which
are n+                              e
      0 -locally finite. Denote by O the similarly defined category of g-modules. Since
    +                      +
U(n ) is finite over U(n0 ), a g-module N belongs O   e iff as a g -module N belongs to O.
                                                                  0
                                         e
In particular, any module of category O has a finite length.

2.4.1. For λ ∈ h∗ denote by Cλ a one-dimensional b-module such that n+ v = 0 and
                                                         f (λ) by setting
hv = λ(h)v for any h ∈ h, v ∈ Cλ . Define a Verma module M
                                    f (λ) := Ue ⊗
                                    M            U (b) Cλ .

A Verma g0 -module M(λ) is defined similarly.

2.4.2. A maximal ideal χe ∈ Max Z(g) is called typical if it does not contain Q defined
in 2.3. If χe ∈ Max Z(g) is typical then the set
                                  e := {λ ∈ h∗ | χ
                               W (χ)             eMf (λ) = 0}

forms a single W.-orbit. For g = osp(1, 2l) all χe ∈ Max Z(g) are typical.
   Call a g-module N typical if AnnZ(g) N is a typical maximal ideal of Z(g). Define the
                                                       P
partial order on h∗ by setting µ ≥ ν ⇐⇒ (µ − ν) ∈ α∈∆+ Nα. A typical Verma module
Mf (λ) is projective (resp., simple) in O
                                        e if λ is maximal (resp., minimal) in W.λ—see, for
instance, [G2], 2.5.3. In particular, for a typical χe ∈ Max Z(g) there exists a projective
Verma module M   f satisfying χ  f = 0.

  A maximal ideal χe ∈ Max Z(g) is called strongly typical if T 2 6∈ χ.
                                                                     e A strongly typical
central character is typical. Call a g-module N strongly typical if AnnZ(g) N is a strongly
typical maximal ideal of Z(g).
                                                        +
   If g is not of types B(m, n), G(3) then ∆+
                                            1 = ∆1 and so the notion of typical and
strongly typical module coincide.

2.5. Throughout the paper we shall write “ad g-module” instead “g-module with respect
to the adjoint action”. For any g-modules N1 , N2 view Hom(N1 , N2 ) := HomC (N1 , N2 ) as
a g-module with respect to the adjoint action and denote by F (N1 , N2 ) the locally finite
part of the ad g-module Hom(N1 , N2 ). Similarly for any g0 -modules N1 , N2 denote by
F (N1 , N2 ) the locally finite part of the ad g0 -module Hom(N1 , N2 ). Notice that for any
g-module N its locally finite part coincides with its ad g0 -locally finite part, since Ue is a
finite extension of U.

2.5.1. Let N be a g0 -module and E be a finite dimensional g0 -module. It is easy to
check that A := F (N, N), B := F (N ⊗ E, N ⊗ E) are subalgebras of Hom(N, N) and
Hom(N ⊗ E, N ⊗ E) respectively. The algebra A acts on F (N, N ⊗ E) from the right and
the algebra B acts on F (N, N ⊗ E) from the left; these actions commute. We claim that
6




F (N, N ⊗ E) is a free right A-module whose rank is equal to the dimension of E and,
moreover, EndA (F (N, N ⊗ E)) = B.
    Indeed, consider the map ι : F (N, N) ⊗ E → Hom(N, N ⊗ E) given by ι(f ⊗ v)(n) =
f (n) ⊗ v for any P
                      f ∈ F (N, N), v ∈ E and the map ι′ : F (N, N ⊗ E) → Hom(N, N) ⊗ E
given by ψ 7→ i pi ◦ ψ ⊗ ei where {ei } is a basis of E and pi : N ⊗ E → N are given by
pi (n ⊗ ej ) := δi,j n ⊗ ej . One can easily sees that Im ι ⊆ F (N, N ⊗ E), Im ι′ ⊆ F (N, N) ⊗ E
and that ι′ ◦ ι = id, ι ◦ ι′ = id. Thus F (N, N ⊗ E) ∼   = F (N, N) ⊗ E is a free right A-module
whose rank is equal to the dimension of E. Similarly, the map ι′′ : A⊗EndC (E) → B given
by ι′′ (f ⊗ φ)(n ⊗ v) := f (n) ⊗ φ(v) for any f ∈ A = F (N, N), n ∈ N, v ∈ E, φ ∈ EndC (E)
is bijective. For any f, f ′ ∈ A, v ∈ E, φ ∈ EndC (E) one has ι′′ (f ⊗ φ)(ι(f ′ ⊗ v)) =
ι(f f ′ ⊗ φ(v)). This implies EndA (F (N, N ⊗ E)) = B since the A-module F (N, N ⊗ E) is
freely generated by the elements ι(1 ⊗ ei ) (here 1 is the unit of A).

2.6. Let M be a Verma g-module. By Duflo’s theorem Ann M = U AnnZ(g0 ) M—see [D].
By [J1], 6.4 the natural map U/(Ann M) → F (M, M) is bijective.
  Let Mf be a strongly typical Verma g-module. Then Ann M      f = Ue Ann     f
                                                                         Z(g) M and the
            e
natural map U/(Ann  Mf ) → F (M,
                               f Mf ) is bijective (see [G2], 9.4,9.5).

3. Equivalence of Categories for a strongly typical central character

equivalent to the category of U-modules N satisfying N = Nχ provided χe ∈ Max Z(g)
is strongly typical and χ ∈ Max Z(g0 ) is its perfect mate—see 2.7.2. The corresponding
quasi-inverse functors are given by N f 7→ Nf and by N 7→ (Indg N) . There are two

versions of this result: graded and non-graded. We consider first a non-graded version. A
graded version is easily deduced from the non-graded one.

category of U-modules N satisfying χr N = 0 and C ∞ be the category of U-modules N

direct limit of modules belonging to Cer for r → ∞.

3.1.1. Let M be a Verma g0 -module such that χM = 0. We shall use the following
equality

                             AnnUe(Indgg0 M) = Uχ
which follows from the fact that Ue is free over U.
    Let us show that

for any N ∈ C ∞ . Indeed, for any N ∈ C 1
                    AnnZ(g) (Indgg0 N) ⊇ Ue χ ∩ Z(g) = AnnZ(g) (Indgg0 M)
that implies the inclusion (2) (for N ∈ C 1 ). Any N ∈ C r admits a finite filtration with
the factors belonging to C 1 and so the inclusion (2) holds for such N. To deduce (2) for
any N ∈ C ∞ , observe that for any v ∈ Indgg0 N there exists a finitely generated submodule
N ′ of N such that Indgg0 N ′ contains v. Since N ′ is finitely generated, it lies in C r for a
suitable r ∈ N+ . This implies the inclusion (2).
    Hence for any N ∈ C ∞

3.1.2. Consider the map f : Ue /(Uχ)e   → F (M, Indgg0 M) induced by the natural map
Ue → F (M, Indgg0 M) given by u 7→ (m 7→ u ⊗ m). We claim f is an isomorphism of left Ue
and right U-modules. Since Ue is free over U and AnnU M = Uχ, the map f is injective.
Kostant’s Separation Theorem (see [Ko]) states the existence of an ad g0 -submodule H ′ of
                                                                                ∼
S(g0 ) such that the multiplication map provides an isomorphism H ′ ⊗ S(g0 )g0 −→ S(g0 ).
Then
                      S(g) = Λg1 ⊗ S(g0 ) = (Λg1 ⊗ H ′ ) ⊗ S(g0 )g0 .
Using [BL], 5.4, it is easy to deduce the existence of an ad g0 -submodule H of Ue such
that the multiplication map provides the isomorphism H ⊗ Z(g0 ) → Ue . Moreover, H ∼ =
Λg1 ⊗ H ′ as an ad g0 -module. By 2.6, H ′ ∼
                                           = F (M, M) as ad g0 -modules. The following

implies the surjectivity of f .
    The bijectivity of f gives the following useful formula

3.3.1.   Theorem.       The functors
                               Ψ : Ce∞ → C ∞     f 7→ N
                                                 N    f,
                                                        χ
                               Φ : C ∞ → Ce∞     N 7→ (Indgg0 N)χe
are mutually quasi-inverse. Moreover, their restrictions provide the equivalence of the
categories Cer and C r for any r ∈ N+ .
  Outline of the proof. We know by 3.2.1 that the functors Ψ, Φ are adjoint. In 3.4.1
we reduce the required assertion to the “case r = 1” that is to the statement that the
restriction Ψ1 , Φ1 of the functors Ψ, Φ to the categories Ce1 , C 1 provide an equivalence of
the categories. Not that 3.4.1 does not use the condition (6).
   Observe that the inclusion Ψ1 (Ce1 ) ⊆ C 1 immediately follows from 2.7.1, but it is not
clear apriori that Φ1 (C 1 ) ⊆ Ce1 . To prove that Ψ1 , Φ1 provide an equivalence of the
categories we show, using Proposition 3.4.3, that the functor Φ′ : N 7→ F (M, M   f) ⊗ N
                                                                                       U
provides an equivalence of the categories C 1 → Ce1 . It is easy to show that Ψ1 is the left
quasi-inverse to Φ′ and so it provides an equivalence of the categories Ce1 → C 1 . Using
10




this fact, we show that Φ(M) ∼
                             =Mf and deduce that Φ is isomorphic to Φ′ . This will
                                                  1
complete the proof.

3.4. Proof of Theorem 3.3.1.

3.4.1. Reduction to the case r = 1. The formula (3) implies that Φ(N) is isomorphic to
the localization of Indgg0 N, considered as a Z(g)-module, at the maximal ideal χe (that is
by the set Z(g) \ χ).
                   e
                                            f) is isomorphic to the localization of N,
  Similarly, the formula (4) implies that Ψ(N                                       f
considered as a Z(g0 )-module, at the maximal ideal χ.
  Taking into account that the induction and the localization functors are exact and
commute with direct limits, one concludes that the assertion of Theorem 3.3.1 is equivalent
to the statement that the restrictions Ψ1 , Φ1 of the functors Ψ, Φ to the categories Ce1 , C 1
provide an equivalence of the categories.

3.4.2. Case r = 1. It remains to show that the restriction Ψ1 of Ψ to the subcategory Ce1
and the restriction Φ1 of Φ to the subcategory C 1 provide an equivalence of the categories
Ce1 and C 1 .
     We start with the following technical proposition.

3.4.3. Lemma.       Assume that N f is a g-module, N is a g -direct summand of N f and
                                                            0
f is a g-direct summand of Ind N. Then the F (N,
N                                g                    f N)-F
                                                         f                          f)
                                                              (N, N) bimodule F (N, N
                                 g0
                                                                   f N
provides a Morita equivalence between the algebras F (N, N) and F (N, f).


Proof. Denote the algebra F (N, N) by A. For any g-module X endow the vector space
F (N, X) with the natural right A-module structure. Since N is a g0 -direct summand
   f, A as a right module over itself is a direct summand of F (N, N).
of N                                                                     f    To obtain the
                                      f
statement one has to check that F (N, N ) is a finitely generated projective right A-module
and that EndA (F (N, Nf)) = F (N,
                               f N).
                                   f

   Denote Indgg0 N by I. Recall that as a g0 -module I = Λg1 ⊗ N. By 2.5.1, F (N, I) is a
free A-module whose rank is equal to the dimension of Λg1 . Since N  f is a direct summand
                          f
of I, the A-module F (N, N) is a direct summand of F (N, I). Hence F (N, N)   f is a finitely
generated projective right A-module. One has EndA (F (N, N  f)) = p End (F (N, I))p where
                                                                          A
                                                               f
p ∈ EndA (F (N, I)) is the idempotent with the image F (N, N ) corresponding to the de-
                              f
composition F (N, I) = F (N, N)⊕F    (N, G). By 2.5.1, the left action of F (I, I) on F (N, I)
                                   ∼                                                    f Nf)
induces an isomorphism F (I, I) −→ EndA (F (N, I)). Thus the left action of F (N,
          f                               f   f   ∼                 f
on F (N, N ) induces an isomorphism F (N, N ) −→ EndA (F (N, N)). The assertion fol-

3.4.4. Retain the notation of 3.3. Consider a canonical map Indgg0 M → M        f . By the
                                                    f is projective in O.
property (b) of (6), this map is surjective. Recall M                     e Consequently,
f is a g-direct summand of Indg M and so the pair (M
M                                                         f , M) satisfies the assumptions
                                 g0
of Lemma 3.4.3. From 2.6 it follows that F (M   f) ∼
                                             f, M   = Ueχe and F (M, M) ∼ = Uχ as algebras.
Taking into account Lemma 3.4.3 one concludes that the functor Φ : C 1 → Ce1 defined by
                                                                    ′

                                      f ⊗ N = F (M, M
                      Φ′ (N) := F (M, M)            f) ⊗ N
                                         Uχ             U

provides an equivalence of the categories.

3.4.5. One has
                                      f ) ⊗ N = F (M, M) ⊗ N = N
                  Ψ1 ◦ Φ′ (N) = F (M, Mχ   U              U

since F (M, M) ∼ = Uχ . Hence Ψ1 is quasi-inverse to Φ′ and it provides an equivalence of
the categories Ce1 → C 1 .
  Let us verify that the functors Φ1 and Φ′ are isomorphic. Formula (5) implies that
                 Φ1 (N) = F (M, (Indgg0 M)χe) ⊗U N = F (M, Φ1 (M)) ⊗U N                 (7)
for any N ∈ C 1 . Thus to show that Φ1 (N) ∼
                                           = Φ′ (N) for all N ∈ C 1 it is enough to verify
only that
                                    (Indgg0 M)χe ∼
                                                 =Mf.                                   (8)
                        f is a g-direct summand of Indg M. Thus it is enough to
As we have shown above, M                             g0
check that
                             Homg(N,f Indg M) = 0
                                          g0

for all simple N                f∼
               f ∈ Ce such that N        f and that

                             dim Homg(Soc M      g0

Recall that Indgg0 M ∼
                     = Coindgg0 M (see 2.8) and so
                       f, Indg M) = Hom (N,
                  Homg(N                  f M) = Hom (Nf , M).

   f ∈ Ce is simple, N
If N                 f = Ψ (N  f) ∈ C is also simple. Taking into account that the g -socle

                                                                 f , M) = 0 if N
                                                                  χ             χ = Soc M

and dim Homg0 (Nχ , M) = 1 otherwise. If Ψ1 (N) = Nχ = Soc M then N = Soc M ∼      f since
Ψ1 : Ce1 → C 1 provides an equivalence of the categories and Ψ1 (M
                                                                 f ) = M. This proves (8).

  Hence the functors Φ1 and Φ′ are isomorphic. This completes the proof of Theo-

3.5. Remarks.

3.5.1. Recall that any N f ∈ Ce is generated by N    f and so is a homomorphic image
                                ∞                     χ
       g f
of Indg0 Nχ . Consequently, the restrictions of the functors Ψ, Φ provide an equivalence
between Ce∞ ∩ Oe and C ∩ O. The same is true for the categories of weight modules. Also,
                      ∞
one can easily see that the Verma modules of Ce∞ ∩ O e correspond to the Verma modules
of C ∞ ∩ O.

3.5.2. Formula (8) which says that Φ(M) ∼ =Mf is crucial for the whole proof. If one had
an independent proof of this formula, one could deduce from it a straightforward proof
of Theorem 3.3.1.

3.6. Graded case. Denote by gr Ce∞ (resp., gr Cer ) the full category of Z2 -graded U-    e
modules Nf satisfying N
                      f =N    f (resp., χ r
                                         e Nf = 0). Consider U as a purely even superalgebra
                        e
                        χ
and define similarly gr C ∞ , gr C r . Denote by # the forgetful functors gr Ce∞ → Ce∞ and
gr C ∞ → C ∞ .

3.6.1. Evidently any N ′ ∈ C ∞ is isomorphic to N # for some N ∈ gr C ∞ — for instance,
one can consider N ′ as a purely even (odd) module. It turns out that the similar assertion
holds for Ce∞ . Indeed, since χe is strongly typical, it contains an element (T 2 − c2 ) for some
non-zero c ∈ C. Denote by Ue0 the even part of Ue ; recall that T lies in the centre of Ue0 .
Any N f ∈ Ce is a direct sum of the Ue -modules N , N where
            ∞                            0              +   −

            f | (T − c)r v = 0, ∀r >> 0},
 N+ := {v ∈ M                                                  f | (T + c)r v = 0, ∀r >> 0}.
                                                    N− := {v ∈ M
One can define a Z2 -grading on N  f by putting N f := N , N  f := N . In such a way, one
                                                   0      +     1     −
                   e         e
obtains a functor C ∞ → gr C ∞ which is left quasi-inverse to the functor #. This implies, in
particular, that for any irreducible graded Ueχe-module N
                                                        f, its image N
                                                                     f# remains irreducible
(non-graded) module.

3.6.2.   Theorem.      The functors
                          Ψgr : gr Ce∞ → gr C ∞ ,     f 7→ N
                                                      N    f,
                                                             χ
                          Φgr : gr C ∞ → gr Ce∞ ,     N 7→ (Indgg0 N)χe
are mutually quasi-inverse. Their restriction provides an equivalence of the categories
gr Cer and gr C r for any r ∈ N+ .

Proof. Repeating the arguments of Lemma 3.2.1, one shows that the functor Ψgr is left
and right adjoint to the functor Φgr .
  The functors Ψ, Φ are quasi-inverse and so the canonical homomorphism αN : N →
Ψ ◦ Φ(N) is an isomorphism for any N ∈ C ∞ . For any N ∈ gr C ∞ denote by αN the
canonical homomorphism N → Ψgr ◦Φgr (N). One has #◦Ψgr = Ψ◦# and #◦Φgr = Φ◦#.
Therefore #(αN ) = αN # . Since αN # is an isomorphism, αN is also an isomorphism.
                                                                                             13




                                                       f) → N
Similarly, the canonical homomorphism βNe : Φgr ◦ Ψgr (N    f is an isomorphism for any
f ∈ gr Ce . Hence gr Ψ and gr Φ are quasi-inverse.
N        ∞

  The equality Ψgr (gr Cer ) = gr C r follows from the equality Ψ(gr Cer ) = C r . This implies
the second claim.


                                      4. An Example
               e
   Say that a U-central character is weakly atypical if it is not strongly typical. In this
section we consider a “generic” weakly atypical central characters for g := osp(1, 2l). We
show that, for such a character m ∈ Max Z(g), the category gr Ce∞ of graded g-modules N  f
           f =N
satisfying N     f is equivalent to the category C of g -modules N satisfying N = N
            m                                      ∞      0                         χ
                                                                e
for an appropriate χ. We see that in this case the category gr C ∞ is “twice smaller” than
one could expect in the strongly typical case.
  Throughout this section all g-modules are assumed to be graded.

4.1. The superalgebra osp(1, 2l) does not have isotropic roots: (β, β) 6= 0 for any β ∈ ∆1 .
As a result, osp(1, 2l) has many features of the simple Lie algebras. For instance, Ue is a
domain, its centre Z(g) is a polynomial algebra and all finite dimensional representations
are completely reducible. In [M1], Musson proved the existence of a harmonic space
      e this is an ad g-submodule of Ue such that the multiplication map provides the
H in U:
                          ∼
isomorphism H ⊗ Z(g) −→ Ue .
     f is strongly typical its annihilator is a centrally generated ideal.
  If M
  Suppose that Mf is not strongly typical; this means that m := Ann     f           2
                                                                   Z(g) M contains T .
Then, by [GL1], 6.2,
                                      f = U(T
                                  Ann M   e Z(g) + m)

                                                                   e
and χe := (T Z(g) + m) is the maximal ideal of the “ghost centre” Z(g) = Z(g) + T Z(g).
           e                                     f
The ideal U χ is primitive since a Verma module M (µ) is simple if µ ∈ W (m) is minimal.
             e

  Moreover, by [GL1], 5.3, for any simple g0 -module V one has

                                   e      f )) =     1
                     dim Homg0 (V, U/(Ann M            dim Homg0 (V, H)                    (9)
                                                     2
where H is the harmonic space mentioned above.

4.2. Retain the notation of 2.4.2. Recall that m ∈ Max Z(g) is strongly typical iff the
elements λ ∈ W (m) do not belong to the hyperplanes
                               Sβ := {µ ∈ h∗ | (µ + ρ, β) = 0}
14




for β ∈ ∆+1 . In this section we consider m ∈ Max Z(g) such that any λ ∈ W (m) belongs
to exactly one hyperplane Sβ that is
                                  ∃!β ∈ ∆+
                                         1 : (λ + ρ, β) = 0.                               (10)
In particular, m is not strongly typical and so T 2 ∈ m. Set
                                      χe := T Z(g) + m.

                      f the vector space
     For any g-module N
                             f := {v ∈ N
                             N         f| χ
                                          er v = 0, r >> 0}
                              χe

is a g-submodule of N  f. Let gr Ce (resp., gr Ce ) be the category of graded g-modules N
                                                                                        f
                                   r             ∞
                                                            ′              ′
               f = 0 (resp., N
satisfying χer N             f =N  f). Observe that Ce ⊆ Ce ⊆ Ce where Ce is the category
                              χe                       1    1     2        1
of graded g-modules N  f satisfying mNf = 0.

                                   f annihilated by χ.
     Fix a projective Verma module M                e Fix χ ∈ Max Z(g0 ) such that

                           (a) M := Mf
                                      χ;0 is a Verma g0 -module
                               f    e                                                      (11)
                           (b) M = U M.
(the existence of χ satisfying (11) will be shown in 4.5). Let C ∞ (resp., C r ) be the category
of g0 -modules N satisfying Nχ = N (resp., χr N = 0).

4.3.    Theorem.     The functors
                            Ψ : gr Ce∞ → C ∞     f 7→ (N
                                                 N     f) ,
                                                         0 χ
                            Φ : C ∞ → gr Ce∞     N 7→ (Indgg0 N)χe
where the grading on Indgg0 N = Ue ⊗U N is determined by assuming N to be even, are quasi-
inverse. Moreover their restrictions to gr Cer and C r respectively provide an equivalence of
these categories.

Proof. First steps of the proof are the same as those in the proof of Theorem 3.3.1.
Considering Indgg0 N as the graded module with respect to the grading defined above one
obtains
                                          f = Hom (N, N
                           Homg(Indgg0 N, N)              f)
                                                   g0      0

for any graded g-module N  f. Repeating 3.2.1, one concludes that the functors Ψ, Φ are
adjoint. Repeating 3.4.1, one reduces the required assertion to “the case r = 1” that is to
the statement that the restrictions Ψ1 , Φ1 of the functors Ψ, Φ to the categories gr Ce1 , C 1
provide an equivalence of the categories.
                                          f The embedding M → M
  Evidently, M is a g0 -direct summand of M.                         f gives rise to a
                   g
non-zero g-map Indg0 M → M  f . Using M
                                      f = UM
                                          e                          f , one concludes
                                             and the projectivity of M
     f is a g-direct summand of Ind M. Denote by B the algebra F (M
that M                                g                                 f, M
                                                                           f ) and by
                                      g0
                                                                                          15




B-Mod the category of B-modules. Taking into account Lemma 3.4.3, one concludes that
the functor Φ′′ : C 1 → B-Mod defined by
                                                 f) ⊗ N
                                Φ′′ (N) := F (M, M   U

provides an equivalence of the categories.
   The category gr Ce1 is the category of graded modules over the superalgebra A :=
e Ue χ).
U/(  e     In Proposition 4.7 below we prove that B = A ⊕ Aθ where θ ∈ F (M,  f Mf)
is given by
                                    θ(v) = (−1)d(v) v.
In particular, θ2 = 1 and θa = (−1)d(a) aθ for any a ∈ A. Define the functor Gr : B-
Mod → gr Ce1 as follows: for any X ∈ B-Mod the A-module structure on Gr(X) is given
by “the restriction of scalars” and the grading is given by
              Gr(X)0 := {v ∈ X| θv = v}, Gr(X)1 := {v ∈ X| θv = −v}.
It is easy to see that Gr provides an equivalence of the categories B-Mod and gr Ce1 . Hence
Φ′ := Gr ◦Φ′′ provides an equivalence of the categories C 1 and gr Ce1 .
  The functor Φ′ : C 1 → gr Ce1 is given by the formula N 7→ F (M, M   f ) ⊗ N where the
                                                                            U
                 f                        f            f
grading on F (M, M ) is defined by F (M, M )i := F (M, Mi ) (i = 0, 1).
  The last step of the proof repeats 3.4.5. Indeed,
               Ψ1 ◦ Φ′ (N) = F (M, (Mf ) ⊗ N = F (M, M) ⊗ N = N
                                       χ;0   U                   U

since F (M, M) ∼
               = Uχ . Hence Ψ1 is quasi-inverse to Φ′ and it provides an equivalence of the
categories Ce1 → C 1 . Now, in order to verify that the functors Φ1 and Φ′ are isomorphic,
one can simply repeat 3.4.5 for the graded modules.

4.4. The restrictions of the functors Ψ, Φ provide an equivalence between Ce∞ ∩ O
                                                                                e and
C ∞ ∩ O and between the corresponding categories of weight modules. The Verma modules
of Ce∞ ∩ O
         e correspond to the Verma modules of C ∩ O.
                                                 ∞


4.4.1. The category gr Ce∞ has a canonical involution Π given by
                                 f) = N
                               (ΠN    f , (ΠN)
                                            f =N f.
                                   0   1       1  0

This leads to an interesting involution Π′ = Ψ ◦ Π ◦ Φ on the category C ∞ . One has
                                    N = ((Indgg0 N)χe)χ;0 ,
                                Π′ (N) = ((Indgg0 N)χe)χ;1

                                  f
  Theorem 4.3 implies that M ′ := M          f
                                   χ;1 = Ψ(Π(M)) is a Verma g0 -module. For N ∈ C 1
one has Φ(N) ∼
             = Φ′ (N) and so
                                Π′ (N) = F (M, M ′ ) ⊗U N.

4.5. It remains to prove Proposition 4.7 and to find χ ∈ Max Z(g0 ) satisfying (11). To
achieve these goals we proceed in a manner similar to [G2], Sect.8.
                                                            f annihilated by χ
    Call χ ∈ Max Z(g0 ) a mate for χe if for a Verma module M                  e the g0 -
            f    f
modules Mχ;0 , Mχ;1 are Verma modules. Call χ ∈ Max Z(g0 ) a perfect mate for χe if it
is a mate and for a simple highest weight module Ve (λ) annihilated by χe the g0 -module
Ve (λ)χ;0 is non-zero.
     In this subsection we construct a perfect mate χ for χe satisfying (10).

                                                                              0      1
the module Mf (λ) has a filtration such that the set of factors coincides with the set
                 i
{M(λ − γ) : γ ∈ Γi }— see [M1], 3.2.
     It is easy to check that for any w ∈ W, γ ∈ Γ

                               w.λ − w∗ γ + ρ0 = w(λ − γ + ρ0 ).                       (12)

Therefore the g0 -central characters of M(w.λ − w∗ γ) and M(λ − γ) coincide. Thus the
multiset of g0 -central characters of {M(w.λ − γ) : γ ∈ Γ} does not depend on the choice
of w ∈ W . Recall that the set

                                   e := {µ ∈ h∗ |χ
                                W (χ)            eMf (µ) = 0}

forms a single W.-orbit.

4.5.2. Say that µ, µ′ ∈ i Zσi have the same parity if (µ − µ′ ) ∈ Z∆+      0 . Suppose that
    ′
γ, γ ∈ Γ both lie either in Γ0 or in Γ1 . This is equivalent to the condition that the
elements γ, γ ′ have the same parity. For any w ∈ W one has w∗ γ − w∗ γ ′ = w(γ − γ ′ )
and so the elements w∗ γ, w∗ γ ′ also have the same parity. Hence both w∗ γ, w∗ γ ′ lie either
in Γ0 or in Γ1 . This has the following consequence: the multiset of g0 -central characters
of {M(w.λ − γ) : γ ∈ Γ0 } coincides either with the multiset of g0 -central characters
of {M(λ − γ) : γ ∈ Γ0 } or with the multiset of g0 -central characters of {M(λ − γ) :
γ ∈ Γ1 }. In particular, if χ ∈ Max Z(g0 ) is such that for some λ ∈ W (χ)       e one has
 f                                                                             ′
M (λ)χ = M(λ − γ0 ) ⊕ M(λ − γ1 ) for certain γi ∈ Γi (i = 0, 1) then for any λ ∈ W (χ)  e the
g0 -modules Mf (λ′ )
                     χ;i are Verma modules.


4.5.3. Define a lexicographic order on C by setting c1 > c2 if Re c1 > Re c2 or Re c1 =

  The condition (10) implies the existence of λ ∈ W (χ)

Set M    f (λ) and

One easily sees that
                                       λ + ρ0 − γ ∈ W (λ + ρ0 )
                                                                          f = M(λ) ⊕
only for γ = σl , 0. Therefore χM(λ − γ) = 0 iff γ = σl , 0. This implies Mχ
M(λ − σl ). By 4.5.2, χ is a mate for χ.
                                      e

4.5.4. Let us show that χ is a perfect mate. Suppose this is not true. Then Ve (w.λ)χ;i = 0
for some w ∈ W and i ∈ {0, 1}. The equality (12) implies that for any y ∈ W
                             f (y.λ) = M(y.λ − y 0) ⊕ M(λ − y σ )
                             M      χ           ∗            ∗ l

and so Ve (y.λ)χ is a homomorphic image of M(y.λ − y∗ 0) ⊕ M(λ − y∗ σl ). The module
Ve (w.λ) is a homomorphic image of the module M(w.λ);
                                                   f        denote the kernel of this homo-
                f                  f
morphism by N . The module N has finite length and the factors of its Jordan-Gölder
series have form Ve (µ) for some µ ∈ W.λ satisfying µ < w.λ. Since 0 = Ve (w.λ)χ;i =
(Mf (w.λ)/N)f                                         f      f
              χ;i , one concludes that the g0 -module Nχ;i = M (w.λ)χ;i has a finite filtration
whose factors are quotients of either M(y.λ − y∗ 0) or M(y.λ − y∗ σl ) for some y ∈ W
satisfying y.λ < w.λ. Hence the highest weight of M   f (w.λ)
                                                              χ;i belongs to the set

                           X := {y.λ − y∗ 0, y.λ − y∗ σl }y∈W         s.t. y.λ<w.λ .
18




              f
The module M(w.λ)    χ;i is isomorphic either to M(w.λ − w∗ 0) or to M(w.λ − w∗ σl ).
Therefore either w.λ − w∗ 0 or w.λ − w∗ σl belongs to the set X.
  If w.λ − w∗ 0 = y.λ − y∗ 0 then, by (12), w(λ + ρ0 ) = y(λ + ρ0 ), that is w −1y ∈
StabW (λ + ρ0 ). One has
                                      l
                                      X                         l
                                                                X

          StabW (λ + ρ0 ) = StabW (        (kj + )σj ) ⊆ StabW ( kj σj ) = StabW (λ + ρ)
                                       1        2               1

since k1 , . . . , kl−1 > kl = 0. Thus w.λ − w∗ 0 = y.λ − y∗ 0 implies w.λ = y.λ. Hence
(w.λ − w∗ 0) 6∈ {y.λ − y∗ 0}y∈W,y.λ<w.λ.
  If w.λ − w∗ 0 = y.λ − y∗ σl then, by (12), w(λ + ρ0 ) = y(λ + ρ0 − σl ) or, equivalently,
w(λ + ρ0 ) = ysβl (λ + ρ0 ) where sβl ∈ W is the reflection with respect to the root βl .
Therefore w −1 ysβl ∈ StabW (λ+ρ0 ). As we already saw StabW (λ+ρ0 ) ⊆ StabW (λ+ρ) and
so w −1 ysβl ∈ StabW (λ + ρ). Then w −1 y ∈ StabW (λ + ρ) since sβl ∈ StabW (λ + ρ). Hence
w.λ − w∗ 0 = y.λ − y∗ σl forces w −1 y ∈ StabW (λ + ρ). We conclude that (w.λ − w∗ 0) 6∈ X.
   Similarly, if w.λ − w∗ σl = y.λ − y∗ 0 then, by (12), w(λ + ρ0 − σl ) = y(λ + ρ0 ). As
we have shown above, this implies w −1y ∈ StabW (λ + ρ). Hence (w.λ − w∗ σl ) 6∈ {y.λ −
y∗ 0}y∈W,y.λ<w.λ.
  Finally, if w.λ − w∗ σl = y.λ − y∗ σl then, by (12), w −1 y ∈ StabW (λ + ρ0 − σl ). One can
easily deduce from the equality
                                                  l−1
                                                  X          1     1
                                  λ + ρ0 − σl =         (kj + )σj − σl
                                                   1         2     2
that StabW (λ + ρ0 − σl ) ⊆ StabW (λ + ρ). Thus (w.λ − w∗ σl ) 6∈ X as required.
     Hence {w.λ − w∗ 0; w.λ − w∗ σl } ∩ X = ∅. This proves that Ve (w.λ)χ;i 6= 0 for i = 0, 1.

  The ideal Ue χe is equal to the annihilator of a Verma module M  f which has a finite
support in Z(g0 ). Therefore any g-module annihilated by Ue χe has a finite support in
Z(g0 ). Arguing as in [G2], 8.3.2, 8.3.3, one can deduce from the definition of perfect

4.7. Proposition. Let M     f be a Verma module annihilated by χ
                                                               e and let A be the image
   e       f   f
of U in F (M , M ) under the natural map. Then
                                         f, M
                                      F (M  f ) = A ⊕ Aθ

where θ ∈ F (M  f ) is given by

                                        θ(v) = (−1)d(v) v.


Proof. Suppose that M  f is simple. By [G2], 11.1.5, for any simple g-module Ve one has
dim Homg(Ve , F (M,
                  f M))
                      f = dim Hom (Ve , H) where H is a harmonic space —see 4.1. The
                                     g
complete reducibility of both H and F (M,    f forces H ∼

ad g0 -invariant and so A = Aθ as ad g0 -modules. In the light of (9), as ad g0 -modules H ∼
                          ∼                                                                  =
A ⊕ A. Since the multiplicity of any finite dimensional g0 -module in H is finite, in order
to prove the equality F (Mf, M
                             f ) = A ⊕ Aθ it is enough to show that F (M,   f M f ) = A + Aθ.
Since θu = (−1)d(u) uθ for any u ∈ Ue , (A + Aθ) is a graded Ue -subbimodule of F (M,   f M).
                                                                                           f
Let χ ∈ Z(g0 ) be a perfect mate for χ.

Then Jθ = {(u, −u)| u ∈ U/(Uχ)} and thus

F (Mf′ , M

to E provides a bijection E → Im f since ker f = ker f ′ = Ue χ.       e Suppose that f (u1 ) =

f (u2 )θ for some u1 , u2 ∈ E; then (u1 − u2 )M0 = 0 and so f (u1 ) = f ′ (u2 )θ that implies
                                                                     ′

u1 = u2 = 0 since f ′ (E) ∩ f ′ (E)θ = 0. Therefore f (E) ∩ f (E)θ = 0. Thus F (M,          f M f)
contains f (E) ⊕ f (E)θ. A Joseph’s reasoning based on the use of GK-dimension, shows

9.2. In particular, F (M   f, M f ) is isomorphic to an ad g-submodule of F (M f′ , M
                                                                                    f′ ). On the
other hand, F (M, f M f ) contains f (E) ⊕ f (E)θ which is isomorphic, as an ad g -module, to
                                                                                    0

         f′ ). Since the multiplicity of each finite dimensional g -module in F (M     f′ , M
                                                                                            f′ ) is
                                                                       0
finite, one concludes that F (M    f, M f ) = f (E) ⊕ f (E)θ = Im f ⊕ θ Im f as required.
