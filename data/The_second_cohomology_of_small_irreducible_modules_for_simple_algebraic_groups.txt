                                                    Abstract. Let G be a simple, simply connected and connected algebraic
                                                    group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0, and let V be
                                                    a rational G-module such that dim V ≤ p. According to a result of Jantzen,
                                                    V is completely reducible, and H 1 (G, V ) = 0. In this paper we show that
                                                    H 2 (G, V ) = 0 unless some composition factor of V is a non-trivial Frobenius
                                                    twist of the adjoint representation of G.

                                               Let G be a quasisimple, connected, and simply connected algebraic group over
                                            the algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. By a G-module V , we
                                            always understand a rational G-module (one given by a morphism of algebraic
                                            groups G → GL(V )). In this paper, we study the cohomology of a G-module V
                                            such that dim V ≤ p. By results of Jantzen [Jan96] one knows that V is semisimple
                                            and that H 1 (G, V ) = 0.
                                               Recall that the Lie algebra g of G is a G-module via the adjoint action. Our
                                            main result is:
                                            Theorem A. Let V be a G-module with dim V ≤ p. Then H 2 (G, V ) 6= 0 if and
                                            only if V has a composition factor isomorphic with a Frobenius twist g[d] of g for
                                            some d ≥ 1.
                                               Differentiating the representation of G on V gives a representation for the Lie
                                            algebra g on V . Assume that V g = 0. Then the theorem says that H 2 (G, V ) = 0.
                                            For V of this sort, the vanishing of H 2 is a consequence of the linkage principle
                                            for G together with results in section 2 which give estimates for the dimensions of
                                            Weyl modules whose high weights are simultaneously in the low alcove and in the
                                            orbit Wp • 0. In fact, the same argument shows that H i (G, V ) is 0 for all i ≥ 1; see
                                            Proposition 5.2. It was pointed out to me that an earlier version of this manuscript
                                            contained an overly complicated proof of this observation.
                                               The crucial case for Theorem A is when V is simple, non-trivial and V g = V .
                                            There is a unique d ≥ 1 such that the “Frobenius untwist” V [−d] is a G-module on
                                            which g acts non-trivially. We have already seen that H i (G, V [−d] ) = 0 for i = 1, 2,
                                            so Theorem A follows from the following two results (see 5.4). [We denote by h the
                                            Coxeter number of the group G.]
                                            Theorem B. Suppose that p ≥ h and that W is a G-module for which H i (G, W ) =
                                            0 for i = 1, 2. Then H 2 (G, W [d] ) ≃ HomG (g, W ) for all d ≥ 1.

Theorem C. If p > h, dim H 2 (G, g[d] ) = 1 for all d ≥ 1. For any p, there is a
d0 ≥ 1 so that H 2 (G, g[d] ) 6= 0 for all d ≥ d0 .
   Theorem B is proved in 5.3; it immediately implies the first assertion of Theorem
C (see 5.5). We give a proof the second assertion of Theorem C in section 5.6.
   We end the paper by applying the results of section 2 to calculations of coho-
mology groups H i (G1 , L), where G1 is the Frobenius kernel, and L is a simple G1
module with dim L ≤ p; see Proposition 6.
   We conclude this introduction by remarking that the result of Jantzen [Jan96]
cited above is one of several recent results studying the semisimplicity of low
dimensional representations of groups in characteristic p. See [Ser94], [McN98],
[McN99],[Gur99], and [McN00] for related work.

questions of Guralnick encouraged the author to consider the problems addressed
in this paper, and several conversations inspired some useful ideas.

                                2. Root systems
2.1. We denote by R an indecomposable root system in its weight lattice X with
simple roots S ⊂ R+ . For each α ∈ S, there is a fundamental dominant weight
̟α ∈ X; the ̟α form a Z basis of X.
   We write α0 for the dominant short root, and α̃ for the dominant long root in
R (these coincide in case there is only one root length).
   The Coxeter number of R is given by
                         h − 1 = sup {hρ, α∨ i} = hρ, α∨
                                                       0 i.
                                  α∈R+

   For m ∈ Z and α ∈ R, let sα,m denote the affine reflection of XR = X ⊗Z R in
the hyperplane Hα,m = {x ∈ XR : hx, α∨ i = m}.
   Let l > h be an integer. The affine Weyl group Wl is the group of affine transfor-
mations of XR generated by all sα,ln for n ∈ Z. According to [Bou72, ch. VI, §2.1,
Prop. 1] Wl is isomorphic to the semidirect product of W (the finite Weyl group)
with lZR. The normalizer of Wl in the full affine transformation group of XR con-
tains all translations by lX, hence Wl is a normal subgroup of W cl , the semidirect
product of W and lX. Moreover, W    cl /Wl ≃ lX/lZR ≃ X/ZR is the fundamental
group of R, which we will denote by π.
            1P                                               cl (also of W and Wl )
   Let ρ =           α. We always consider the dot action of W
            2 α∈S
on X: for w ∈ W cl and λ ∈ X, this is given by w • λ = w(λ + ρ) − ρ.
   The subset Cl of XR given by
              Cl = {λ ∈ XR | 0 < hλ + ρ, α∨ i < l   for each α ∈ R+ }.
is a fundamental domain for the dot action of Wl on X; its conjugates under Wl
                                                         cl normalizes Wl , [Bou72,
are known as alcoves, and Cl is the lowest alcove. Since W
                         cl permutes the alcoves.
ch. VI, §2.1] shows that W
   Let Ω be the stabilizer in W cl of C. Since Wl permutes the alcoves simply
transitively, one deduces that Wcl is the semidirect product of Ω and Wl . Thus
      c
Ω ≃ Wl /Wl ≃ π.

   Since l > h, the intersection Cl ∩ X + is non-empty. [Note that if l ≤ h had been
allowed, we would have Cl ∩ X + = {0} in case l = h, and Cl ∩ X + = ∅ if l < h.] It
                   cl • 0 ∩ Cl = {ω • 0 | ω ∈ Ω}.
is then clear that W

                                                              P
2.2. Let I index the simple roots S = {αi }, write α∨   0 =
                                                                        ∨
                                                                i∈I ni αi , and put
J = {i ∈ I | ni = 1}. A dominant weight 0 6= ̟ ∈ X is minuscule if whenever
λ ≤ ̟ and λ is a dominant weight, then ̟ = λ. According to [Bou72, Ch. VI,
exerc. 23,24], ̟ is minuscule just in case ̟ = ̟i for some i ∈ J.
   For i ∈ I ∪ {0}, let Si = S \ {αi } (so S0 = S). Write Ri ⊂ R for the root
subsystem determined by Si , and Wi for the parabolic subgroup of W associated
with Ri . Let wi ∈ Wi be the unique element which makes all positive roots in Ri
negative.
   For x ∈ X, let t(x) denote the affine translation by x; for i ∈ J, let γi =
               cl . Note that γi represents ̟i ∈ X/ZR ≃ lX/lZR ≃ W
t(l̟i )w0 wi ∈ W                                                     cl /Wl .
   Applying [Bou72, ch. VI, §2.2 Prop. 6 and Cor.] one obtains:

Proposition. (a) Each non-0 coset of ZR in X is uniquely represented by a
     minuscule weight. In particular, |π| = |J| + 1.
 (c) The non-identity elements of Ω are precisely the γi for i ∈ J. We have

                  cl • 0 ∩ Cl = {0} ∪ {γi • 0 = (l − h)̟i | i ∈ J}
                  W

2.3.   For a dominant weight λ, let
                                        Y hλ + ρ, α∨ i
(1)                            d(λ) =
                                        α>0
                                            hρ, α∨ i

be the value of Weyl’s degree formula at λ.

Proposition. Let λ = (l − h)̟i for some i ∈ J.
              l−1
                  
 (a) d(λ) ≥ l−h    , with equality if and only if h − 1 = ℓ(w0 wi ).
 (b) If l − h ≥ 2 and h ≥ 3, then d(λ) > l.

Proof. For 1 ≤ k ≤ h − 1, let e(k) be the number of α ∈ R+ \ Ri+ with hρ, α∨ i = k.
The argument in the remark on p. 520-521 of [Ser94] (following Prop. 6) shows
that e(k) ≥ 1 for each 1 ≤ k ≤ h − 1. Thus, we have

                       Y
                       h−1
                             l−h+k
                                      e(k)       h−1
                                                  Y     l−h+k
                                                                  
                                                                  l−1
                                                                      
              d(λ) =                          ≥               =        .
                               k                          k       l−h
                       k=1                        k=1

If ℓ(w0 wi ) = |R+ | − |Ri+ | = h − 1, then e(k) = 1 for each 1 ≤ k ≤ h − 1 and equality
holds. This proves (a).                                                              
                                                                                 l−1
    For (b), note that under the given hypothesis we have l ≥ 5. Since l−h             ≥
 l−1
     
   2   > l for all such l, (b) follows immediately.

Remark. Using the table in the proof of Proposition 2.4 below, it is straightforward
to verify that equality holds in (a) if and only if either R = Ar and i ∈ {1, r} or
R = Cr and i = 1. (Since B2 = C2 , the latter case includes B2 and i = 2.)

2.4.   In the following, let me emphasize the standing assumption l > h.
Proposition. If 0 6= λ ∈ W   cl • 0 ∩ C and d(λ) < l then d(λ) = ℓ − 1 and (R, λ) is
listed in the following table. If the rank of R is ≥ 2, then l = h + 1.


                             R            l           λ

                             C(l−1)/2     l odd       ̟1
Proof. The rank 1 situation leads to the item listed in the table. When the rank is
at least 2, one applies Proposition 2.3 to obtain l = h + 1, whence λ = ̟i for some
i ∈ J; i.e. λ is minuscule.
   We handle the minuscule cases by classification. For each indecomposable root
system R for which J 6= ∅, we list in the following table the Coxeter number, the set
J, and the value d(̟i ) for each i ∈ J. The simple roots are indexed as in the tables
in [Bou72, Planche I-X]; the data recorded here, with the exception of the values
d(̟i ), may be verified by inspecting those tables as well. The values d(̟i ) are
well known (and can anyway be computed from the formula, or by representation
theoretic arguments).
           Type of R    h         J                   d(̟i ), i ∈ J

           E7           18        {7}                 56
From this table, one can list all pairs (R, λ) for which R has Coxeter number l − 1
and λ is minuscule. It is a simple matter to see that d(λ) < l only when (R, λ) is
as claimed.

                            3. The algebraic groups
3.1. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0, and let G be a
connected, simply connected semisimple algebraic k-group. The non-0 weights of
a maximal torus T ≤ G on g = Lie(G) form an indecomposable root system R of
rank r = dim T in the character group X = X ∗ (T ). Since G is simply connected,
X identifies with the full weight lattice of R as in section 2. We fix a choice of
simple roots S and positive roots R+ . The dominant weights are denoted X + . The
group G is assumed to be quasisimple; i.e. the root system R is indecomposable.
3.2. For each dominant weight λ ∈ X + , the space of global sections of the cor-
responding line bundle on the flag variety affords an indecomposable rational G-
module H 0 (λ) with simple socle. The modules L(λ) = soc H 0 (λ) comprise all of
the simple rational modules for G (and are pairwise non-isomorphic).
   The character of each H 0 (λ) is the same as in characteristic 0; hence in particular
dimk H 0 (λ) is given by the Weyl degree formula, whose value at λ we denote d(λ)
as in 2.3.

                                                       P
3.3. Any dominant λ may be written as a finite sum i≥0 pi λi with each λi a
restricted weight. Recall that a dominant weight µ if hµ, α∨ i < p for all simple
roots α. Steinberg’s tensor product theorem says:

   For d ≥ 1, let Gd be the d-th Frobenius kernel of G. Let V be a rational G-
module and m ≥ 1. If there is a rational G module W with W [m] ≃ V , we regard
W as the Frobenius untwist W = V [−m] of V . Now regard V as a module for Gd .
Since Gd is a normal subgroup scheme, G acts on V Gd ; since Gd acts trivially on
this G-module, there is an untwisted rational G-module (V Gd )[−d] . It follows that
there is an untwist H i (Gd , V )[−d] for all i ≥ 0.
                                                                [d]
   Consider now two G-modules V1 and V2 , and form W = V1 ⊗V2 . The Frobenius

kernel Gd acts trivially on V2 , so that
(1)                    H i (Gd , W )[−d] ≃ H i (Gd , V1 )[−d] ⊗ V2

3.4. Let Wp ≤ Wcp be as in section 2 (for l = p), let C = Cp ∩ X + denote the
dominant weights in the lowest alcove, and let C̄ = C̄p ∩ X + (C̄p is the closure in
XR ).
Proposition. Let λ ∈ X + .
 (a) If H i (G, L(λ)) 6= 0 for some i ≥ 0. then λ ∈ Wp • 0.
                                                      cp • 0.
 (b) If H i (G1 , L(λ)) 6= 0 for some i ≥ 0, then λ ∈ W
        i      0
 (c) H (G, H (λ)) = 0 for all i > 0.
 (d) If λ ∈ C̄, then L(λ) = H 0 (λ); in particular, dim L(λ) = d(λ).
Proof. (a) follows from the linkage principle for G [Jan87, Cor. II.6.17], and (b)
from the linkage principle for G1 [Jan87, Lemma II.9.16]. (c) follows from [Jan87,
II.4.12]. (d) follows from [Jan87, II.6.13,II.5.10].

              4. The Lie algebra and the cohomology of G1
   We want to describe explicitly the cohomology H ∗ (G1 , k) in degree ≤ 2. For
this, we need some information on the Lie algebra g.
4.1. Recall that the prime p is bad [=not good] for the indecomposable root system
R if one of the following holds: p = 2 and R is not of type Ar ; p = 3 and R is of
type G2 ,F4 , or Er ; p = 5 and R is of type E8 .
   The prime p is very good if it is not bad, and in case R = Ar , if also p does not
divide r + 1.
   Application of the summary in [Hum95, 0.13] yields:
Lemma A. Assume that p is very good. Then g is a simple Lie algebra. The
adjoint G-module is simple, self-dual, and isomorphic with L(α̃) where α̃ is the
dominant long root.
  Notice that if p > h, then p is very good.
Lemma B. Assume that p ≥ h. If W is any G-module, then HomG (g, W [d] ) = 0
for d ≥ 1.
6                                GEORGE J. MCNINCH


Proof. When p > h this follows since g is a simple g-module with restricted highest
weight. When p = h, we have R = Ap−1 . Since G is simply connected, we have
g = slp . Thus g is an indecomposable G-module with unique simple quotient L(α̃),
and the lemma follows.

4.2. Let B be a Borel subgroup of G, and let u be the nilradical of Lie(B). Re-
garding u∗ as a B-module, we get a vector bundle on G/B which we also write as
u∗ . According to [AJ84, 3.8], the formal character of the G-module H 0 (G/B, u∗ )
is χ(α̃) = ch(g∗ ).
    Let N ⊂ g be the nilpotent cone. There is by [AJ84, 3.9] an injective homomor-
phism of graded algebras k[N ] → H 0 (G/B, Su∗ )
Lemma. For simply connected, quasisimple algebraic groups G, g∗ ≃ k[N ]1 ≃
H 0 (G/B, u∗ ).
Proof. Let I(N ) ✁ k[g] = Sg∗ be the (homogeneous) defining ideal of the variety
N . We need to show that I(N )1 = 0. If not, then N ⊂ V ⊂ g for some proper
G-submodule V . A look at the summary in [Hum95, 0.13] shows that, since G is
simply connected, the only G-submodules of g have dimension 0 or 1. On the other
hand, by [Hum95, Theorem 6.19], the variety N has codimension rank(G) in g and
so clearly can’t be contained in a 1 dimensional linear subspace!

Remarks.   1. Here is a fancier result which implies the lemma if we assume that
    the prime p is good for G. Since G is simply connected and p is good, the
    Springer resolution
                             ϕ : Ñ = G ×B u → N
       given by (g, X) 7→ Ad(g)(X) is a desingularization, hence in particular a
       birational map; see [Hum95, Theorem 6.3 and Theorem 6.20]. Again since G
       is simply connected and p is good, the variety N is normal ([Hum95, Theorem
       4.24]). Standard arguments then yield an isomorphism of graded algebras
             ϕ∗
       k[N ] −→ Γ(Ñ , OÑ ). Finally, the projection Ñ → G/B is an affine morphism,
             ≃
       so that Γ(Ñ , OÑ ) = H 0 (G/B, Su∗ ) as a graded algebra.
    2. On the other hand, if G = P GLr , and p|r, one can find a linear form on g that
       vanishes on N , hence there can be no isomorphism k[N ]1 → H 0 (G/B, u∗ )
       (compare formal characters). So the lemma can fail when G is not simply
       connected. [Note that ϕ is not birational in this example. One can show that
       there is a Gsc -isomorphism ψ : Ñsc → Ñ (using some obvious notations). We
       get therefore a commuting diagram:
                                        ϕsc ◦ψ −1
                                     Ñ C     / Nsc
                                         CC
                                                    γ
                                           CC
                                          ϕ CCC
                                                ! 
                                                 N
       The map ϕsc ◦ ψ −1 is birational. Since γ ∗ k(N ) ⊂ k(Nsc ) is a proper purely
       inseparable extension, so too is ϕ∗ k(N ) ⊂ k(Ñ ).]
Proposition.    1. If p 6= 2 or if R is not of type Cr , then H 1 (G1 , k) = 0.
  2. Assume that p ≥ h. Then H 2 (G1 , k)[−1] ≃ g∗ as G-modules.
                  THE SECOND COHOMOLOGY OF SMALL MODULES                            7


Proof. For (1) see [Jan87, Lemma II.12.1]. For (2), first suppose that p > h.
By [AJ84, 3.7,3.9], there is a G-equivariant isomorphism of graded rings k[N ]′ ≃
H ∗ (G1 , k)[−1] where k[N ]′ is again the graded coordinate ring of N , but with the
linear functions on g given degree 2. The claim now follows from the lemma.
   When p = h, apply [AJ84, Cor. 6.3] to see that H 2 (G1 , k)[−1] ≃ H 0 (G/B, u∗ );
the claim follows again from the lemma in this case.

                      5. Low dimensional modules for G
5.1. We recall first some facts about low dimensional modules established in
[Jan96] and [Ser94].
Proposition. Let L be a simple non-trivial restricted G module with highest weight
λ. Suppose that dim L ≤ p.
 (a)   λ ∈ C̄.
 (b)   λ ∈ C if and only if dimk L < p.
 (c)   h ≤ p. If moreover dim L < p, then h < p.
 (d)   If R is not of type A and dim L = p, then h < p. If p = h and dim L = p,
       then R = Ap−1 and λ = ̟i with i ∈ {1, p − 1}.
Proof. (a) follows from [Jan96, Lemma 1.4], and (b) from [Jan96, 1.6], see also
[Ser94]. For (c), note first that (a) implies dim L = d(λ) by Proposition 3.4(d). If
λ ∈ C̄ \ C, then (a) and (b) imply that dim L = p, whence p = h follows from
Weyl’s degree formula. (c) now follows since C is empty if p < h and C = {0} if
p = h.
   In [Jan96, 1.6], Jantzen made a list of all simple restricted modules for G with
dimension p. Inspecting that list yields (d).

5.2. Vanishing results when g acts non-trivially. Let L be a simple module
for G.
Proposition. If G1 (equivalently: g) acts non-trivially on L and dim L ≤ p, then
H i (G, L) = 0 for all i ≥ 0.
Proof. Write the highest weight of L as λ = µ1 + pµ2 with µ1 restricted. Since
Lg = 0, we have µ1 6= 0. Since p ≥ dim L ≥ dim L(µ1 ), Proposition 5.1 implies
that µ1 ∈ C̄ and that h ≤ p. We have in particular that L(µ1 ) = H 0 (µ1 ), hence
the proposition will follow from Proposition 3.4 if we show that µ2 is 0.
   If dim L = p, Steinberg’s tensor product theorem gives µ2 = 0. If dim L < p
then 5.1 shows that p < h and µ1 ∈ C. If H i (G, L) 6= 0 for some i, then λ ∈ Wp • 0
by the linkage principle, whence µ1 ∈ W • 0 + pX = W      cp • 0. Now Proposition
2.4 applies; it shows that dim L(µ1 ) = p − 1 whence we have µ2 = 0 by another
application of Steinberg’s theorem.

5.3. Second cohomology. Here we prove our main tool for describing second
cohomology; first we require the following:
Lemma. Let E2p,q =⇒ H p+q be a convergent, first quadrant spectral sequence.
  1. If E20,1 = E21,1 = E20,2 = 0, then H 2 ≃ E22,0
  2. If E21,0 = E21,1 = E22,0 = 0, then H 2 ≃ E20,2 .
8                                  GEORGE J. MCNINCH

                                                                           2,0
Proof. We verify (1), the argument for (2) is the same. We must show that E∞   ≃
 2,0                   2,0
E2 ; first note that E3 is the cohomology of the sequence
                                  E20,1 → E22,0 → E24,−1
from which we get E32,0 ≃ E22,0 . For any first quadrant spectral sequence one
                                         2,0
has (by similar reasoning) that Ea2,0 ≃ Ea+1  for a > 2, so we get the desired
isomorphism.
Theorem. Suppose that p ≥ h. Let V be a G-module for which H i (G, V ) = 0 for
i = 1, 2, and let d ≥ 1.
   1. H 1 (G, V [d] ) = 0, and
   2. H 2 (G, V [d] ) ≃ HomG (g, V ).
Proof. The Frobenius kernel G1 is a normal subgroup of G; thus there is a Lyndon-
Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence computing H i (G, V [d] ) which in view of 3.3 (1)
has the form
         E2s,t = H s (G, H t (G1 , V [d] )[−1] ) = H s (G, H t (G1 , k)[−1] ⊗ V [d−1] )
If t = 1, E2s,t = 0 by Lemma 4.2(1).
    There is an exact sequence of the form [Jan87, I.4.1(4)]
                         0 → E21,0 → H 1 (G, V [d] ) → E20,1 = 0.
Thus H 1 (G, V [d] ) ≃ E21,0 ≃ H 1 (G, V [d−1] ). We get now (1) by induction on d.
  Lemma 4.2(2) shows now that H 2 (G1 , k) ≃ g∗ . Thus, the only possible non-0
E2 terms of total degree 2 are
                    E20,2 =H 0 (G, g∗ ⊗ V [d−1] ) = HomG (g, V [d−1] )
                    E22,0 =H 2 (G, V [d−1] ).
  For d > 1, we apply 4.1 Lemma B to see that E20,2 = 0 whence H 2 (G, V [d] ) ≃
E22,0= H 2 (G, V [d−1] ) by part (1) of the lemma; thus (2) will follow provided it
holds for d = 1. In that case, we have E22,0 = 0 by assumption, and the result just
proved in part (1) shows that E21,0 = 0. Thus part (2) of the lemma applies; it
shows that H 2 (G, V [1] ) ≃ E20,2 = HomG (g, V ) as desired.
5.4. The second cohomology of small modules. Let L = L(λ) be a simple G-
module, and suppose that dim L ≤ p. Proposition 5.2 showed that the vanishing of
cohomology for L is a consequence of the linkage principle when λ 6∈ pX. However,
if λ ∈ pZR, λ is linked to 0, so the linkage principle does not yield vanishing. The
following result shows that, despite the linkage of λ and 0 in this case, the second
cohomology is usually 0.
Theorem. Let L be a simple G-module with dim L ≤ p. If H 2 (G, L) 6= 0, then
L ≃ g[d] for some d ≥ 1.
Proof. Let L′ be such that L ≃ (L′ )[d] for d ≥ 0, and such that g acts non-
trivially on L′ . We have by 5.1 that p ≥ h. Also, we have by Proposition 5.2 that
H i (G, L′ ) = 0 for i ≥ 1. If d = 0, we are done. If d > 1, then Theorem 5.3 applies,
and we get that
                                H 2 (G, L) ≃ HomG (g, L′ ).
                  THE SECOND COHOMOLOGY OF SMALL MODULES                            9


  We get by Proposition 5.1 that p > h unless R = Ap−1 and L′ = L(̟i ) with
i ∈ {1, p − 1}. If p > h, then g is a simple G-module by Lemma 4.1. So if
HomG (g, L′ ) 6= 0 then L′ ≃ g whence L ≃ g[d] as claimed.
  In the remaining case, one must just note that weight considerations yield
HomG (g, L(̟i )) = 0 for i = 1, p − 1, whence H 2 (G, L) = 0.
5.5. The second cohomology of twists of the adjoint module. The first
assertion of Theorem C of the introduction follows from the following:
Proposition. Assume that p > h. Then H 1 (G, g[d] ) = 0 and H 2 (G, g[d] ) ≃
EndG (g) has dimension 1 for d ≥ 1.
Proof. Since p > h, Lemma 4.1 shows that g is the simple module with highest
weight α̃. It follows that g = H 0 (α̃), and thus that H i (G, g) = 0 for i ≥ 1 by
Proposition 3.4. The proposition now follows from Theorem 5.3.
Remark. Note that dim g > h (in fact, dim g = (h + 1)r where r is the rank of G).
So we get also: if dim g ≤ p, then dim H 2 (G, g[d] ) = 1 for d ≥ 1.
5.6. A second proof. Here we give a second proof of the non-vanishing of H 2 for
twists of the adjoint module; the result proved here verifies the remaining assertion
of Theorem C of the introduction. We have included the argument since it offers
some “explanation” for the non-vanishing.
    The group G arises by base change from a split reductive group scheme G over Z.
Let Zp be the complete ring of p-adic integers, and let Qp be its field of quotients.
For any finite field extension F of Qp , let o denote the integers in F . The residue
field o/m may be identified with the extension Fq of Fp .
    Let K denote the group of points G(o) regarded as a subgroup of G(F ). Since
G is smooth, the reduction homomorphism K → G(Fq ) is surjective (see [Tit79,
3.4.4]).
    For n ≥ 1, let Kn ⊂ K be the kernel of the map K → G(o/mn ). Note that
K/K1 = G(Fq ) acts by conjugation on each quotient Kn /Kn+1 .
Proposition. (a) There is for each m ≥ 1 a canonical isomorphism Km /Km+1 ≃
     gFq as representations for G(Fq ), where gFq is the Lie algebra of GFq .
 (b) If H 2 (G(Fq ), gFq ) = 0, the exact sequence of groups
                            1 → K1 → K → G(Fq ) → 1
     splits.
 (c) There is a p-power q0 , depending only on the root system R of G, such that
     H 2 (G(Fq ), gFq ) 6= 0 whenever q ≥ q0 .
 (d) There is an integer a0 ≥ 1 such that H 2 (G, g[a] ) 6= 0 whenever a ≥ a0 .
Proof. (a) Follows from [DG70, II.§4.3]. (b) Since K1 is a pro-p group [PR94,
Lemma 3.8], this follows from [Ser67, Lemma 3].
   (c) Choose a Qp vectorspace V and a non-trivial faithful Qp -rational represen-
tation GQp → GL(V ). For each extension F of Qp with integers o, the group K =
G(o) is a subgroup of (the group of F -points of) GL(VF ). If H 2 (G(Fq ), gFq ) = 0,
the sequence in (b) is split and VF is a non-trivial F [G(Fq )]-module.
   Since F has characteristic 0, it is well known that the minimal dimension of a
non-trivial F [G(Fq )] module is bounded below by the value f (q) of a polynomial
f ∈ Q[x], depending only on G, for which f (q) → ∞ as q → ∞. We may choose q0
such that f (q) > dimQp V for each q > q0 , and (c) follows at once.
10                                   GEORGE J. MCNINCH


     (d) now follows from (c) and [CPSvdK77, Cor. 6.9].

                           6. Small simple modules for G1
  Combining results of [KLT99] with the results recorded in 2.4, we obtain some
explicit results on G1 cohomology of low dimensional simple modules:
Proposition. Let L be a non-trivial simple G1 module with dim ≤ p. Assume for
some i ≥ 0 that H i (G1 , L) 6= 0. Then dim L = p−1. Moreover, there is a quadruple
(R, λ, i(0), V ) in the following table for which R is the root system of G, λ the high
weight of L, i ≥ i(0) and H i(0) (G1 , L)[−1] ≃ V as G-modules.

                R                     λ             i(0)     H i(0) (G1 , L)[−1]
                A1                    (p − 2)̟1     1        L(̟1 )
                Ap−2                  ̟1 , ̟p−2     p−2      L(λ)
                C(p−1)/2     p odd    ̟1            p−2      L(λ)
Proof. By [Jan87, Prop. II.3.14], L = resG     G1 L(λ) for some restricted dominant
weight 0 6= λ. Thus L(λ) is a restricted, simple G module with dimension ≤ p.
It follows from Proposition 5.1 that h ≤ p, that λ ∈ C̄, and that L = H 0 (λ) as
modules for G.
   Suppose that H i (G1 , L) 6= 0 for some i. By the linkage principle for G1 (Propo-
sition 3.4(b)), we must have λ ∈ W   cp • 0, hence λ ∈ C. This implies that h < p.
Proposition 2.2 shows that λ = (p − h)̟i = w0 wi • 0 + p̟i for some i ∈ J, and
Proposition 2.3 yields dim L = p − 1 and lists the possible pairs (R, λ).
   For h < p, Kumar, Lauritzen and Thomsen [KLT99, Theorem 8] have extended
a result of Andersen and Jantzen [AJ84, 3.7]; this result implies in particular that
the minimal degree for which H ∗ (G1 , L) is non-0 is ℓ(w0 wi ), and that
                              H ℓ(w0 wi ) (G1 , L)[−1] ≃ H 0 (̟i ).
It is straightforward to compute for each pair (R, λ) the length ℓ(w0 wi ); one gets
in this way the result.

Remark. The Theorem implies the fact (used by Jantzen in the proof of [Jan96,
Lemma 1.7]) that H 1 (G1 , L) = 0 for all simple G1 modules L with dim L ≤ p.
The argument used by Jantzen there relied on the calculations of H 1 carried out
in [Jan91].
