                                                     matrix. We show how to derive the defining relations between these generators and explicitly
                                                     write them for a “most natural” (“distinguished” in terms of Penkov and Serganova) system
                                                     of simple roots. The results are given mainly for Lie superalgebras whose component of
                                                     degree zero is a Lie algebra (other cases being left to the reader). Observe presentations of
                                                     exceptional Lie superalgebras and Lie superalgebras of hamiltonian vector fields. Now we
                                                     can, at last, q-quantize the Lie Lie superalgebras of hamiltonian vector fields and Poisson
                                                     superalgebras.



                                                                                       §1. Preliminaries
                                                After Berezin formulated in 1971 to one of us (DL) the problem which in modern terms
                                             would have sounded “define supermanifolds and construct differential supergeometry” a first
                                             step was to look after examples of Lie superalgebras that naturally appear in mathematics.
                                             Homotopy rings with respect to Whitehead’s product are examples of such Lie rings, but
                                             nobody, so far, described these natural rings in any case. By description we mean identi-
                                             fication of the semisimple part and radical. A reason for such careless attention to these
                                             most natural rings becomes clear soon after one tackles the problem: they are nilpotent,
                                             hence, not so interesting in a sense (simple Lie (super)algebras have a richer structure and
                                             interesting representation theory). A result of C. Löfvall and J.-E. Roos indicates that this
                                             deduction might be too hasty.
                                                In a similar problem C. Löfvall and J.-E. Roos [LR] made a break-through observation:
                                             they not only found traces left by simple Lie superalgebras where nothing indicated them
                                             but also identified these superalgebras as a “positive part” of certain twisted loops algebras
                                             with values in simple Lie superalgebras. The paper [LR] is, clearly, the first in a series
                                             to appear, where, among other things, Löfvall and Roos will needPpresentations (in other
                                             words, generators and defining relations) of the positive part g> =      gi of certain (twisted)
                                                                       P                                          i>0
                                             loop superalgebra g =       gi , associated with the simple (or a close to the simple) finite
                                                                         i>0

                                             relations, compare with appalling presentation of [T] or implicit presentations of the positive

    We hope that our results contribute to the fest on the occasion of Jan-Erik’s birthday and
make his calculations, if not life, easier.
    Namely, we observe that even in the absence of g0 there is a concise way to encode the
presentation. Indeed, in the majority of cases g> is the direct sum of irreducible g0 -modules
gi , and, as Lie superalgebra, g> is generated by g1 . If g1 is irreducible, as in cases of Löfvall
and Roos, then, instead of dim g1 generators, it suffices to take just one, any one vector,
say the lowest weight vector.
    The space of relations (same as the space of generators in the general case) must not split
into the direct sum of irreducible g0 -modules, but, nevertheless, one can list only the vacuum
vectors, i.e., the lowest AND highest weight vectors (since some modules can be glued in
indecomposable conglomerates, we need both). Mathematica-based package SuperLie ([G])
helps to find these vacuum vectors.
    To reduce volume of the paper, we did not reproduce the standard homological inter-
pretation of relations and spectral sequence leading to the answer; for Lie algebras it is
expressed in [LP] and its superization is straightforward via the Sign Rule. Observe only
that since relations represent homology class, they can be “pure” or “dirty” if defined modulo
boundaries.
    History and an overview. The traditional way to determine classical simple finite
dimensional Lie algebra (over C) is via Chevalley generators, though other generators are
possible. For discussion of other possibilities with examples see [GL1]. Recently a presenta-
tion of simple Lie superalgebras of the four Cartan series of vector fields was given [LP] and,
together with Serre relations for affine Kac–Moody algebras [K1], this completed description
of presentations of simple Z-graded Lie algebras of polynomial growth (presentations with
respect to other choices of generators are certainly possible).
    Here we consider simple Z-graded Lie superalgebras of polynomial growth (and close
to them “classical” Lie superalgebras, such as central extensions of the simple ones, their
algebras of differentiations, etc.). Their list is conjecturally ([LS1]) completed and consists
of
    • the finite dimensional ones (classification results by Kaplansky and Nahm-Rittenberg-
Scheunert [FK], [NRS] were skillfully rounded up by Kac [K2]),
    • the vectorial algebras, i.e., algebras of vector fields, (classification announced [LS1] and
partly proved [LS2] by Leites and Schepochkina; the proof was again quickly rounded up by
Kac and Cheng [K3], bar some gaps, see [Sh5]),
    • the twisted loop algebras (with symmetrizable Cartan matrix [vdL]), or obtained as
twisted loops [FLS], and
    • the stringy (i.e., vectorial algebras pertaining to string theories) algebras (for their
intrinsic definition and list see [GLS1]).
    In terms of presentations, another subdivision is more natural:
    (a) the algebras of the form g(A) with Cartan matrix A (subdivided into subclasses (as )
with symmetrizable Cartan matrix and (an ) with non-symmetrizable Cartan matrix,
    (q) the series psq and its relatives (central extensions, exterior differentiations, etc.) and
    (v) the vectorial algebras and their relatives, the members of the subclass are easily rec-
ognized by lack of the property “if α is a root, then so is −α”.
    For g(A) (both subcases) a very redundant presentation is given in [LSS] and, the minimal
one, in [GL2]; their q-quantization (for symmetrizable A) is described in [Y]. The redundant
presentation [LSS], though very long, has an advantage: it only involves Serre relations.
Regrettably, it is so redundant that practically it is useless.
    For q(n) and q(n)(1) see [LSe]; presentation of twisted loops is an open problem.
                      DEFINING RELATIONS FOR CLASSICAL LIE SUPERALGEBRAS                          3

  For presentations of vectorial Lie algebras see [LP]; the series with g0 a Lie algebra see
[GLP]; here we also consider several cases left in [GLP] as open problems and the Lie
superalgebras of Hamiltonian vector fields and its central extension: Poisson superalgebra.
The last two cases are of interest in relation with spinor-oscillator representations and its
q-quantization, see [Kl], [LSh].
  Though several results describing presentations of simple and close to them vectorial
superalgebras were obtained a while ago ([Ko], [T]) they are given in the form too bulky to
grasp or implicit ([U]; [FF]). A simplification of presentations is desirable: for g0 = sh(0|n)
the dimension of the space of relations computed in [T] for n = 5 is equal to 420 and grows
with n, whereas the total number of vacum vectors in the space of relations is < 10 and does
not grow with n, cf. Tables 2.1.2.
  Problem formulation. Consider Z-graded Lie superalgebras g = ⊕ gi of the following
                                                                           i∈Z
two types:
   (1) vectorial Lie superalgebras, i.e., of finite depth d (in the above sum i ≥ d), cf. [LP];
   (2) of infinite depth, but not of the form g(A) (the algebras g(A) being already considered
in complementing each other papers [GL2] and [Y]) or of type q (for whose presentation see
[LSe]).
   Among these algebras we will first consider the ones for which g0 is a Lie algebra. The
general case is an open problem, which can be solved any time for any given g via the lines
indicated here and with the help of Grozman’s SuperLie package.
   Observe that in [GL2] and [Y] all bases (systems of simple roots or, rather, corresponding
generators) are considered. For the vectorial algebras and superalgebras and for loop algebras
with values in vectorial superalgebras we have considered below just one of the possible bases.
It can well happen that presentations corresponding to some other base is nicer in some
sense: e.g., for a rank n simple Lie algebra, Serre relations corresponding to 3n Chevalley
generators though numerous (∼ n2 ) are very simple and easy to compute, unlike a handful
of independent on n but more intricate relations between the pair of “Jacobson generators”
considered in [GL1]. Nevertheless, both presentations are needed. For a method of passage
from base to base (an analog of the Weyl group) see [PS].
   Let g+ = ⊕ gi and g− = ⊕ gi ; let n± be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of g0 described
               i>0                   i<0
in textbooks (e.g., [OV]) if g0 is a Lie algebra or in [PS] (see also refs. therein) if g0 is a Lie
superalgebra. We decompose g into the sum N− ⊕ h ⊕ N+ , where N± = n± ⊕ g± , and for the
cases when g0 is a Lie algebra (purely even) describe the defining relations. The relations
obtained for vectorial Lie superalgebras are not very simple-looking, cf. [LP].
   Notice that, unlike the case of finite dimensional simple Lie algebras, the bases, i.e.,
systems of simple roots, correspond not to maximal solvable Lie superalgebras (described in
[Shc]) but to what is called Borel subalgebras in [PS].
   Open problems are listed in §4.

 §1. Generators in some vectorial Lie superalgebras and associated loops
1.1. Generators of vect(0|n). Set ∂i = ∂x∂ i . Some of the generators of vect(0|n) generate
its subalgebras as indicated (i.e., the Xi+ and Y generate N+ ; the Xi± generate sl(1|n)):
                                  sl(1|n)
                                                   P
      N+         x1 ∂2 , . . . , xn−1 ∂n , xn          xi ∂i xn xn−1 ∂1
      N−             x2 ∂1 ,   . . . , xn ∂n−1 ,   ∂n
   notations          X1± ,             ±
                               . . . , Xn−1 , Xn±                Y

The generators of svect(0|n) are the same as of vect(0|n) but without the boldfaced element
Xn+ = xn xi ∂i . The loop algebras have two more generators: for vect(0|n) set
        P

                                          X0− = x1 . . . xn ∂n · t−1 and X0+ = ∂1 · t.
For svect(0|n) set
                         X0− = x1 . . . xn−1 ∂n · t−1 and X0+ = ∂1 · t.
It is not clear that this choice of generators (the highest weight vector of g−1 and the
lowest weight vector of g1 ) which gives nice-looking relations for Lie algebras (and even Lie
superalgebra with Cartan matrix) is the best when Lie superalgebras are very non-symmetric.
1.2. Generators of k(1|n). In what follows we will by abuse of language write just f
instead of either Hf , the Hamiltonian vector field generated by f or Kf , the contact vector
field generated by f ; in so doing we must remember that in either case (Hf or Kf ) the degree
of the vector field generated by a monomial f of degree k is equal to k − 2.
   Some of the generators of k(1|n) generate the following subalgebras (for n = 2k > 6 and
n = 2k + 1 > 5, respectively):
                                osp(2k|2)                                        osp(2k + 1|2)
      N+        tη1    ξ1 η2 . . . ηn ξn−1        ξn ξn−1   η1 η2 η3   tη1    ξ1 η2 . . . ηn ξn−1     ξn θ   η1 η2 η3
      N−        ξ1    η1 ξ2    . . . ηn−1 ξn      ηn ηn−1              ξ1    η1 ξ2   . . . ηn−1 ξn    ηn θ
    notations        X0±      X1±   ...     ±
                                           Xn−1   Xn±         Y         X0±    X1±    ...    ±
                                                                                            Xn−1     Xn±       Y

The generators of h(0|n) and po(0|n) are those above without the boldfaced element X0+ =
tη1 .
  The loop algebras h(0|n)(1) and po(0|n)(1) have two more generators:
                                Y0− = ξ1 . . . ξn ηn ηn−1 . . . η2 · t−1 and Y0+ = η1 · t.
It is not clear that this choice of generators is the best and it is desirable to experiment with
other choices.
   In small dimensions (n < 7) relations look differently and are to be computed separately.
Besides, the generators look different. Though presentations of some of these algebras were
considered, it is advisabable to revise it (the results of A. Nilsson are unpublished and those
of [FNZ], as well of [T], should be presented in a more user-friendly form).
                                                        §2. Relations
2.1. Relations for N− of k(1|n), po(0|n) and h(0|n). Clearly, N− for vect(0|n) and
svect(0|n) coincides with n− for sl(1|n) while N− for k(1|n) and po(0|n) coincides with n−
for osp(n|2), which are known [LSe], [GL2].
2.1.1. Relations for N− of h(0|n). The Lie algebra h(0|n) is generated by the same
elements as k(1|n) and po(0|n) but the relations are different: for h(0|n) there is an additional
relation of weight (0, . . . , 0) with respect to o(n) because (for n > 1)
                                            H2 (g−1 ) = S 2 (g−1 ) = R(2π) ⊕ R(0).
The corresponding cycle of weight 0 is
                                {ξ1 , η1 } + · · · + {ξn , ηn } (+{θ, θ} if n is odd ).                                 (∗)
The relation expressed in terms of generators looks awful. It can be beautified as follows.
In the space of relations corresponding to the other irreducible component the subspace of
relations of weight 0 is of dimension n − 1. Therefore, n − 1 summands in (∗) vanish; for
role of survivor select the simplest one of them, say, the following one: {ξ1 , η1 } = 0.

2.2.4. The periplectic series. Recall that the compatible (with parity) Z-gradings of
spe(n) are of the form spe(n) = g−1 ⊕ g0 ⊕ g1 and there are two such cases both with
g0 = sl(n): (here id is the standard sl(n)-module):
  a) g1 = S 2 (id), g−1 = E 2 (id∗ );
  b) g1 = E 2 (id), g−1 = S 2 (id∗ ) .
    Let n± be the maximal nilpotent subalgebras of g0 . Set
                                       m+ = n+ ⊕ g1 ;        m− = n− ⊕ g−1
Denote by X + (resp. X − ) a vector of lowest (highest) weight in the g0 -module g1 (resp.
g−1 ). The first term ⊕ E1p,q of the spectral sequence converging to H2 (m± ) consists of
                           p+q=2

                   E12,0 = H2 (n± ),     E11,1 = H1 (n± ; g±1 ),      E10,2 = H0 (n± ; E 2 (g±1 )).
Since we already know H2 (n± ), we are only interested in the other two summands. In case
(a), (resp. (b)), H1 (n± ; g±1 ) is the same as for m+ of sp(2n) and for m− of o(2n) (resp. for
m− of o(2n) and sp(2n) of m+ ), we explicitly have:
                                  (adXn+ )3 (X + ) = 0,       (adXn− )2 (X − ) = 0                           (a)

                                  (adXn+ )2 (X + ) = 0,       (adXn− )3 (X − ) = 0                            (b)
with  [Xi+ , X + ]
                =      [Xi− , X − ]
                            = 0 for i < n in both cases (a) and (b).
  Let ϕi be the ith fundamental weight of g0 , R(χ) the (space of the) irreducible repre-
sentation with highest weight χ. Now, for the sl(n)-modules g1 = R(2ϕ1 ) in case (a) and
g1 = R(ϕ2 ) in case (b), we have:

                              S 2 (R(2ϕ1 )) = R(4ϕ1 ) ⊕ R(2ϕ2 )
                                             (
                                              R(2ϕ2 ) ⊕ R(ϕ4 ) if n > 3
                              S 2 (R(ϕ2 )) =
                                                  R(2ϕ2 )       if n = 3.
Therefore, we have the relations
                                   [X ± , X ± ] = 0                                    for both cases a) and b)
and the relations
                                                                       −
                 (a) [X + , [Xn+ , [Xn+ , X + ]]] = 0, [X − , [Xn− , [Xn−1 , X − ]]] = 0;
                                                                       −
                                                                                                         (P eR± )
                 (b) [X + , [Xn+ , [Xn+ , X + ]]] = 0, [X − , [Xn− , [Xn−1 , X − ]]] = 0.
of which the first in case (a) and the second in case (b) are only defined if n > 3.

the deform of the Lie superalgebra osp(4|2) corresponding to the value of parameter equal
to ε, i.e., d(ε) = g(A) for any of the following Cartan matrices (cf. [GL2]):

The algebra d(ε) has an outer automorphism of order 3; select the generators of the maximal
nilpotent subalgebras of d(ε)(3) as follows. Let X1± , X2± , X3± be the Chevalley generators of
d(ε). Set
             Y1+ = εX1+ + ε2 X2+ + X3+ ,                         Y2+ = [X3− , [X1− , X2− ]];

  The relations between these generators are:

2.3.2. Stringy superalgebras. For the exceptional stringy superalgebra kasL introduced
in [GLS1] (and in [CK]) the relations are computed in [GLS1] and, in another form, in [CK].
Observe that the relations of kas are not simply the relations for kasL that do not involve
the extra generators.
   Among the stringy superalgebras kL (1|6) is one of the most interesting: it possesses a
nondegenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form and, therefore, can be q-quantized, cf.
[LSp].
   The basis of g+ for the standard Z-grading of kL (1|6):
                 X1+ = ξ1 η2 ,             X2+ = ξ2 η3 ,            X3+ = ξ2 ξ3 ,           X0+ = tη1 ,
             X̃1+ = 1t ξ1 ξ3 η2 η3 , X̃2+ = 1t ξ1 ξ2 η1 η3 , X̃3+ = 1t ξ1 ξ2 ξ3 η1 , X̃0+ = η1 η2 η3
The generators Xi± for i 6= 0, clearly, generate o(6) while all of them generate osp(6|2). One
expects the same relations between them, but the other generators interfere and the final
result is as follows (we skip the superscript):
                     [X2 , X3 ] = 0, [X2 , X0 ] = 0, [X3 , X0 ] = 0, [X0 , X0 ] = 0;

     §4. Presentation of vectorial Lie superalgebras: an overview of open
                                   problems
4.1. Vectorial Lie superalgebras with polynomial coefficients and loops with
values in them.

Lemma . ([ShV]) There are embeddings of Lie superalgebras such that their negative parts
as Z-graded Lie superalgebras coincide:

                      sl(n + 1|m) ⊂ vect(n|m),             osp(m|2n + 2) ⊂ k(2n + 1|m),
                      pe(n + 1) ⊂ m(n),           spe(n + 1) ⊂ sm(n).

  This is already something: it remains to establish presentation of N+ only. The rest of
the known information is gathered in the following statement, cf. [HP]. The cases when the
Lie superalgebra is not simple are marked by a + sign; we disregard them in this paper.

Theorem . The following table lists the restrictions for the relations of the subalgebra N+
of a simple vectorial Lie superalgebra to be “pure” (blank space) or “dirty” (marked by a
dot).

4.3. Stringy and vectorial superalgebras: other bases. We have only computed the
relations in several cases. There remains to compute the relations in the cases marked by a
thick dot (and a cross) in Table 4.1 and for the exceptional algebras [Sh5] (for the consistent
gradings thereof this is done in [GLS2]; for the other W-gradings it is desirable, at least, for
completeness). It is desirable to compute them for all simple stringy superalgebras or, at
least, for the distinguished algebras that admit nontrivial central extensions most often used
in applications, cf. [GLS1], and for other bases of vectorial algebras and superalgebras.
