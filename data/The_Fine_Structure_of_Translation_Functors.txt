                                                    Abstract. Let E be a simple finite dimensional representation of a
                                                    semisimple Lie algebra with extremal weight ν and let 0 6= e ∈ Eν . Let
                                                    M (τ ) be the Verma module with highest weight τ and 0 6= vτ ∈ M (τ )τ .
                                                    We investigate the projection of e ⊗ vτ ∈ E ⊗ M (τ ) on the central
                                                    character χ(τ + ν). This is a rational function in τ and we calculate
                                                    its poles and zeros. We then apply this result in order to compare
                                                    translation functors.

                                             Let k be a field of characteristic zero and let g be a split semisimple Lie
                                             algebra over k. Then h ⊂ b ⊂ g denote a Cartan and a Borel subalgebra,
                                             U = U(g) the universal enveloping algebra and Z ⊂ U its center. We set
                                             R+ ⊂ R ⊂ h∗ to be the roots of b and of g. Let n (resp. n− ) be the sum of
                                             the positive (negative) weight spaces and denote by P + ⊂ P ⊂ h∗ the set

of dominant and the lattice of integral weights respectively. Let W be the
Weyl group.
A g-module M is called Z-finite, if dimk (Zm) < ∞ for all m ∈ M . Every
Z-finite module M splits under the operation of the center Z into a direct
sum of submodules M = ⊕χ∈MaxZ Mχ . Here χ runs over the maximal
ideals in the center and Mχ ∈ M∞ (χ), where
    M∞ (χ) := {M | for all m ∈ M there exists n ∈ N such that χn m = 0}.
We denote the projection onto the central character χ by prχ : M 7→ Mχ .
By means of the Harish-Chandra homomorphism [Di, 7.4] ξ : Z → S(h)
(normalized by z − ξ(z) ∈ Un ∀z ∈ Z) we assign to each weight τ ∈ h∗ its
central character χ(τ ) defined by χτ (z) := ξ(z) (τ ) ∀z ∈ Z.
Let now ν ∈ P be an integral weight and denote by E := E(ν) the irreducible
finite dimensional g-module with highest weight in Wν. It is known that
for each Z-finite module M the tensor product E ⊗ M is again Z-finite [BG,
Corollary 2.6]. If we now tensor a module M ∈ M∞ χ(τ ) with E and
then project onto the central character χ(τ + ν), we obtain the translation
functor

                Tττ +ν : M∞ χ(τ ) −→ M∞ χ(τ + ν)

                                M            7→   prχ(τ +ν) (E ⊗ M )

In the present paper we investigate the fine structure of translation functors.
Namely, take for M the Verma module M (τ ) := U(g) ⊗U(b) kτ with its
highest weight vector vτ := 1 ⊗ 1 ∈ M (τ )τ and then identify for all τ ∈ h∗ :
                                           ∼
                                M (τ ) −→ U(n− )
                                uvτ    7→   u
We set V (ν) = V := E ⊗ U(n− ), choose a fixed extremal weight vector
eν ∈ Eν and define the map
                       fν :    h∗ −→          V
                               τ   7→ prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ )
Here we identify prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ ) ∈ E ⊗ M (τ ) with its image in V . The
image of the map fν is then contained in the finite dimensional ν-weight
space (E ⊗ U(n− ))ν of V , and we may thus regard fν as a map between
varieties. In P
              general however, fν is not a morphism.
Let ρ := 1/2 α∈R+ α denote the half sum of positive roots, α∨ the co-root
of α and set
          Nν := {(α, mα ) ∈ R+ × Z | −hρ, α∨ i ≤ mα < −hν + ρ, α∨ i}.
Then the set
                                [
                     Hν :=               {τ ∈ h∗ | hτ, α∨ i = m}
                              (α,m)∈Nν

is a finite family of hyperplanes and therefore Zariski closed. We will show
at first that fν is a morphism of varieties on the complement of Hν ∪ S,
where S ⊂ h∗ is a suitable Zariski closed subset of codimension ≥ 2. More
precisely, S consists of intersections of finitely many hyperplanes.

Define for all roots α ∈ R and for all m ∈ Z the polynomial function Hα,m
on h∗ by
                    Hα,m (τ ) := hτ, α∨ i − m for all τ ∈ h∗ .
If we then set δν := (α,m)∈Nν Hα,m , we obtain Hν = {τ ∈ h∗ | δν (τ ) = 0}.
                      Q

A central result of this paper will be the following
Theorem. There exists a morphism of varieties G : h∗ → Vν , such that
the set of zeros of G has codimension ≥ 2 and such that G equals δν fν on
h∗ − (Hν ∪ S).
This means that the map fν has a pole of order 1 along each of the hyper-
planes hτ, α∨ i = m with (α, m) ∈ Nν and outside of these hyperplanes it is
a non-vanishing morphism of varieties except on a set of codimension ≥ 2.

In chapter 4 we introduce the so-called triangle functions ∆(µ, ν; x)(τ ) for
integral weights µ and ν and x ∈ W. These are rational functions on h∗ ,
which measure in a subtle way the relation between the two translation func-
        +ν+µ
tors Tττ+ν   ◦Tττ +ν and Tττ +ν+µ by first applying them to the Verma modules
M (τ ) and M (x · τ ) and then identifying the results with M (τ + ν + µ) and
M (x · (τ + ν + µ)) respectively.
Bernstein defined in [Be] the so-called relative trace trE for a finite di-
mensional vector space E and this function is related to the special case
∆(−ν, ν; w0 ), where ν is dominant and w0 is the longest element of W. This
is explained in Chapter 5. By Bernstein’s explicit formula for trE we obtain
Corollary. Let ν ∈ P + be dominant and τ ∈ h∗ generic, i.e. hτ, α∨ i ∈
                                                                     / Z
for all α ∈ R. Then
                                     Y hτ + ν + ρ, α∨ i
                 ∆(−ν, ν; w0 )(τ ) =                    .
                                      +
                                         hτ + ρ, α∨ i
                                       α∈R

We remark that Kashiwara has also calculated this case [Ka, Thm. 1.9].
In Chapter 6 we calculate the triangle functions in general. Since they are
rational functions on h∗ , it suffices to determine their zeros and poles. In
order to do this we make use of the maps fν for suitable integral weights ν.
Set now ᾱ(λ) := 1 for hλ, α∨ i < 0 and ᾱ(λ) := 0 for hλ, α∨ i ≥ 0. Then we
obtain
Theorem. Let ν, µ ∈ P be integral weights and x ∈ W. Then
                         Y hτ, α∨ iᾱ(ν) hτ + ν, α∨ iᾱ(µ) hτ + ν + µ, α∨ iᾱ(ν+µ)

                          2. Filtration of E ⊗ M (τ )
In the following let ν ∈ P be a fixed integral weight. Then let ν1 , . . . , νn be
the multiset of weights of E = E(ν), i.e. with multiplicities, and let (ei )1≤i≤n
be a basis of weight vectors of E, such that P     ei ∈ Eνi and νi < νj ⇒ i < j.
Here λ ≤ µ for weights λ, µ ∈ h∗ , if µ − λ = α∈R+ nα α with nα ∈ N.
In [BGG1] it was shown     Pn that the  tensor product E ⊗ M (τ ) admits a chain
of submodules Ni := j=i U(n )(ej ⊗ vτ ), such that Ni /Ni+1 ∼
                                    −
                                                                    = M (τ + νi ).
Using this, one can easily construct a slightly coarser filtration, namely a
filtration such that the subquotients are each isomorphic to a direct sum
of Verma modules with the same highest weight. In order to do this, let
µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µm denote the set of weights of E without multiplicities and set
dj := dim Eµj . We may choose the numbering of the νi in such a way that
νk = µj for all k with d1 + · · · + dj−1 < k ≤ d1 + · · · + dj . The weight
space Eµj is then generated by precisely these ek . Set d0 := 0 and define for
1 ≤ j ≤ m:
                m
                X                                 n
                                                  X
        Mj :=         U(n− )(Eµk ⊗ vτ ) =                       U(n− )(ek ⊗ vτ ).
                k=j                         k>d1 +d2 +···dj−1

We obtain immediately: The chain E ⊗ M (τ ) = M1 L        ⊃ · · · ⊃ Mm ⊃ 0
is a filtration of submodules such that Mj /Mj+1 =      ∼
                                                           dj M (τ + µj ) and
the summands M (τ + µj ) are generated by the vectors (ei ⊗ vτ )/Mj+1 =
pr(ei ⊗ vτ )/Mj+1 , where ei is a vector of weight µj .

Lemma
Q          1. For 1 ≤ j ≤ m let sj ∈ Z with χτ +µj (sj ) = 0 and set zi :=
  j≥i sj . Then for 1 ≤ i ≤ m we get: zi Mi = 0.
In particular, for a weight vector eµi ∈ Eµi we obtain

                   zi+1 (eµi ⊗ vτ ) = zi+1 prχ(τ +µi ) (eµi ⊗ vτ ).

Proof. The first statement follows by induction from above and since a cen-
tral element z ∈ Z operates on the Verma module M (λ) by multiplication
with the scalar χλ (z).
By construction of the Mi it is clear, that for eµi ⊗ vτ ∈ Mi its projections
prχ(τ +µ) (eµi ⊗ vτ ) lie already in Mi+1 if χ(τ + µ) 6= χ(τ + µi ). But eµi ⊗ vτ
equals the sum of its projections and thus the second statement follows from
the first.

Note that for the extremal weight ν = νi0 = µj0 its weight space is of
dimension 1. Therefore, we can always choose the numbering of the νi such
that i > i0 ⇐⇒ νi > νi0 = ν or equivalently j > j0 ⇐⇒ µj > µj0 = ν. It
then follows immediately that an element of Mi0 = Mj0 (of Mi0 +1 = Mj0 +1
resp.) consists only of parts with central character χτ +µ for µ ∈ P (E) with
µ ≥ ν (µ > ν resp.). For eν ⊗ vτ ∈ Mi0 we thus obtain the following special
case of Lemma 1

Lemma 2. ForQ µ ∈ P (E) with µ > ν let sµ ∈ Z such that χτ +µ (sµ ) = 0
and set z := µ>ν sµ . Then z(eν ⊗ vτ ) = z prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ ).

3.1. Algebraicity of fν . For ν ∈ P fixed, set E := E(ν) and let fν be the
map
                       fν : h∗ −→            V
                            τ    7→ prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ )
where V = V (ν) := E ⊗ U(n− ) ∼     = E ⊗ M (τ ) for all τ ∈ h∗ . We will
first construct a Zariski open set U ⊂ h∗ such that fν restricted to U is a
morphism of varieties. In this case we will also say that fν is algebraic on
U.
Before we go on, we need some more notation P    : The dot-operation of the
Weyl group on h∗ has fixed point −ρ = −1/2 α∈R+ α and is defined by

h∗ and P(h∗ )W· the (W·)-invariants. We define the operator

                                    for all λ ∈ h∗ , s ∈ P(h∗ ).

For any µ ∈ P (E) with µ > ν we now choose an element hµ ∈ h, hµ 6= 0
and define maps Hµ : h∗ × h∗ −→ k by

If we fix τ ∈ h∗ , the map Hµ (−, τ ) : h∗ −→ k is then a polynomial function
on h∗ and its kernel is obviously a hyperplane in h∗ . We then define a

By means of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism [Di, 7.4] ξ : Z −→ P(h∗ )W· ,
      exist central elements sµ ∈ Z, such that ξ(sµ ) = sym Hµ (−, τ ). For
there Q
zτ := µ>ν sµ we have ξ(zτ ) = pτ . Define now the map
                         u = u{hµ } :   h∗ −→       k
                                        τ   7→ pτ (τ + ν)
and set U{hµ } := {τ ∈ h∗ | u(τ ) 6= 0} ⊂ h∗ .
Lemma 3. The map fν restricted to U{hµ } is a morphism of varieties and
for all τ ∈ U{hµ } we have fν (τ ) = (u(τ ))−1 zτ (eν ⊗ vτ ).
Proof. We know χτ +µ (sµ ) = (ξ(sµ ))(τ + µ) = (sym Hµ (−, τ ))(τ + µ) = 0
and by Lemma 2 we conclude zτ (eν ⊗ vτ ) = zτ prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ ).
Let now τ ∈ U{hµ } , i. e. u(τ ) 6= 0. This means, that for all w ∈ W and for
all µ ∈ P (E) with µ > ν we have hw·(τ +ν)−τ −µ, hµ i 6= 0 and in particular
w · (τ + ν) 6= τ + µ or equivalently χ(τ + ν) 6= χ(τ + µ)∀µ ∈ P (E), µ > ν.
This implies, that already the projection prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ ) ∈ E ⊗ M (τ )
generates a Verma module M (τ + ν). A central element z operates on this
by multiplication with the scalar (ξ(z))(τ + ν) = u(τ ). We therefore get
zτ (eν ⊗ vτ ) = zτ prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ ) = u(τ )fν (τ ) and the above equation
follows.

We have yet to show that fν is algebraic on U{hµ } . By construction of zτ
it is clear that zτ depends algebraically on τ for all τ ∈ h∗ . Also the map
τ 7→ zτ (eν ⊗ vτ ) ∈ V is a morphism on h∗ and 1/u is per definition algebraic
on U{hµ } . Thus fν restricted to U{hµ } is a morphism.
Example. Let ν ∈ P (E) be an extremal and dominant weight. For all
µ ∈ P (E) with µ 6= ν we then have µ < ν and we may choose zτ := 1 ∈ Z
for all τ ∈ h∗ . The above lemma then implies U{hµ } = h∗ , the map fν is a
morphism on h∗ and fν (τ ) = eν ⊗ vτ for all τ .
                                                 S
Lemma 3 implies that fν is algebraic on U := U{hµ } , where the union is
taken over all possible choices for {hµ | µ ∈ P (E), µ > ν}. If we set
       A := {τ ∈ h∗ | u(τ ) = pτ (τ + ν) = 0 for all choices of {hµ }},
we can write U as U = h∗ − A. Since pτ (τ + ν) = µ∈P (E),µ>ν w∈W hw ·
                                                       Q              Q

(τ + ν)− τ − µ, hµ i we know that τ is in A if and only if there exists a w ∈ W
and a µ ∈ P (E) with µ > ν, such that w · (τ + ν) = τ + µ. Thus we obtain
                          [
                 A=            {τ ∈ h∗ | w · (τ + ν) = τ + µ}.
                      µ∈P (E),µ>ν
                         w∈W

Let us examing more closely the sets on the right hand side: For w = sα , α ∈
R, we get {τ ∈ h∗ | hτ, α∨ iα = ν − µ − hν + ρ, α∨ iα}, which implies that this
set is nonempty if and only if there exists a weight µ = ν − hτ + ν + ρ, α∨ iα
in the α-string through ν, such that µ ∈ P (E) and µ > ν. Since ν was
an extremal weight, it is either the greatest or the smallest weight in this
α-string and hence such a µ exists only if hν, α∨ i < 0 for an α ∈ R+ . In this
case all µ(n) := ν + nα for 1 ≤ n ≤ −hν, α∨ i are weights of E with µ(n) ≥ ν.
Comparing this with µ = ν − hν + ρ + τ, α∨ iα we obtain as condition for τ
precisely −hρ, α∨ i ≤ hτ, α∨ i ≤ −hν + ρ, α∨ i − 1 for an α ∈ R+ .
Set W 0 := {w ∈ W | w 6= sα for an α ∈ R}. For
      Nν := {(α, mα ) ∈ R+ × Z | −hρ, α∨ i ≤ mα < −hν + ρ, α∨ i}

        S :=
                 µ∈P (E),µ>ν
                   w∈W 0

we get A = Hν ∪ S and S consists of finitely many intersections of at least
two hyperplanes and is therefore a Zariski closed subset of codimension ≥ 2.
We remark that in general Hν and S are not disjoint. Using Lemma 3 we
obtain
Lemma 4. The map fν is algebraic on the complement of Hν ∪ S.
3.2. Poles of fν . Theorem 1 and proof. Let now δν ∈ P(h∗ ) be the
product of the equations of the hyperplanes in Hν , that is

where Hα,m (τ ) := hτ, α∨ i − m. We then have Hν = {τ ∈ h∗ | δν (τ ) = 0}.
              THE FINE STRUCTURE OF TRANSLATION FUNCTORS                          7

Theorem 1. There exists a morphism of varieties G : h∗ −→ Vν , such that
the set of zeros of G has codimension ≥ 2 and such that G equals δν fν on
h∗ − (Hν ∪ S).
The proof comes in two parts. In the first part we demonstrate the existence
of an algebraic extension G of δν fν on the whole of h∗ , in the second we will
show that the set of zeros of G has codimension ≥ 2. It will be useful to
introduce the set S1 ⊂ h∗ of all intersections of hyperplanes in Hν . So if we
set
     S1 := {τ ∈ h∗ | Hα,m (τ ) = 0 = Hβ,n (τ ) for (α, m) 6= (β, n) ∈ Nν }
then S ∪ S1 is a Zariski closed subset of codimension ≥ 2. Note that (Hν ∩
S) ⊂ S1 and hence Hν − (S ∪ S1 ) = Hν − S1 . By definition of S1 we obtain
immediately
Lemma 5. Let τ ∈ Hν − S1 . Then there exists exactly one α ∈ R+ , such
that sα · (τ + ν) = τ + µ0 for a weight µ0 of E with µ0 > ν, namely
µ0 = ν − hτ + ν + ρ, α∨ iα. For all µ ∈ P (E) with µ > ν and µ 6= µ0
we have w · (τ + ν) 6= τ + µ for all w ∈ W.
Proof of Theorem 1. Again let U = h∗ − (Hν ∪ S) be the set on which fν is
algebraic. First we claim
  (∗) For all τ0 ∈ h∗ − (S ∪ S1 ) there exists a Zariski open neighborhood U0
      of τ0 and an algebraic map G0 : U0 → Vν , such that G0 = δν fν on
      U ∩ U0 .
This statement then implies the existence of an algebraic extension of δν fν
locally around every point of h∗ −(S ∪S1 ). This extension is unique and thus
we obtain a global algebraic extension on h∗ −(S ∪S1 ). Since codim(S ∪S1 ) ≥
2 we can extend this to a morphism G on the whole of h∗ .
Let now τ0 ∈ h∗ − (S ∪ S1 ).
      / Hν , then τ0 ∈ U = h∗ − (Hν ∪ S) and since fν was algebraic on U
If τ0 ∈
(Lemma 4), claim (∗) follows with U0 := U and G0 := δν fν .
Let now τ0 ∈ Hν . By assumption we then have τ0 ∈ Hν −(S ∪S1 ) = Hν −S1 ,
and Lemma 5 implies that hτ0 , α∨ i = t0 ∈ Z for exactly one α ∈ R+ and
µ0 = ν − hν + ρ + τ0 , α∨ iα is a weight of E with µ0 > ν.
Again we construct a set U{hµ } with a particular choice of {hµ }. Namely,
choose for all weights µ ∈ P (E) with µ > ν and µ 6= µ0 elements hµ ∈ h,
such that Hµ (w · (τ0 + ν), τ0 ) = hw · (τ0 + ν) − τ0 − µ, hµ i 6= 0 for all w ∈ W.
For µ0 however, choose hµ0 such that
   a) hα, hµ0 i =
                6 0 and
   b) Hµ0 (w·(τ0 +ν), τ0 ) = hw·(τ0 +ν)−τ0 −µ0 , hµ0 i 6= 0 for all sα 6= w ∈ W.
Lemma 5 ensures that  Q such a choice of {hµ } is always     possible. For τ ∈ h∗
we set again pτ := µ∈P (E),µ>ν sym Hµ (−, τ ), and ξ −1 (pτ ) =: zτ ∈ Z. For
u defined by u(τ ) = pτ (τ + ν) we then obtain U{hµ } = {τ ∈ h∗ | u(τ ) 6= 0}.
According to Lemma 3 the map fν restricted to U{hµ } is algebraic. Let’s
have a closer look at the map u : It vanishes alongthe hyperplane ker Hα,t0 ,
because
         for all τ ∈ h∗ we have Hµ0 sα · (τ + ν), τ = −hα, hµ0 i · hτ, α∨ i −
t0 = a · Hα,t0 (τ ), where a := −hα, hµ0 i 6= 0 according to assumption a).
All the other hyperplanes along which u vanishes are not equal to ker Hα,t0
but do at most intersect it. Otherwise (since τ0 ∈ ker Hα,t0 ) we would have
8                                  KAREN GÜNZL
                     
Hµ w · (τ0 + ν), τ0 = 0 for a pair (µ, w) 6= (µ0 , sα ) which is impossible by
our choice of the hµ .
For ū : h∗ → k defined by ūHα,t0 = u, it follows by what we just said that
ū(τ0 ) 6= 0. With U0 := {τ ∈ h∗ | ū(τ ) 6= 0} we then get
    • τ 0 ∈ U0
    • 1/ū is algebraic on U0
    • U{hµ } = U0 − ker Hα,t0 , thus U0 = U{hµ } ∪ ker Hα,t0
    • (U ∩ U0 ) ⊂ U{hµ } , since U ∩ ker Hα,t0 = ∅.
If we define δ̄ = δ̄ν : h∗ → k by δ̄Hα,t0 = δν and set
                   G0 :    U0 −→               V
                                              −1
                           τ  7→ δ̄(τ ) ū(τ )    zτ (eν ⊗ vτ )
we know that G0 is algebraic on U0 . In particular, G0 is algebraic on an
open neighborhood of τ0 . This is now the local algebraic extension of δν fν
around τ0 which we were looking for, because according to Lemma 3 we have
for all τ ∈ U{hµ } :
       δν (τ )fν (τ ) = δν (τ ) (u(τ ))−1 zτ (eν ⊗ vτ )
                     = δ̄ν (τ )Hα,t0 (τ ) (Hα,t0 (τ ))−1 (ū(τ ))−1 zτ (eν ⊗ vτ )
                     = G0 (τ ).
In particular, this equation holds for all τ ∈ (U ∩ U0 ) ⊂ U{hµ } , i.e. (∗).

It remains to show that the set of zeros of G has codimension ≥ 2.
In order to do this, let S2 be the union of all intersections of hyperplanes in
Hν with any other integral hyperplanes, that is
       S2 := S1 ∪ {τ ∈ Hν | hτ, α∨ i = m ∈ Z for a pair (α, m) ∈
                                                               / Nν }.
We claim
 (∗∗) K := {τ ∈ h∗ | G(τ ) = 0} ⊂ (S ∪ S2 )
and conclude then that codim K ≥ 2. Indeed, by definition the set S ∪ S2
consists of a countable family of intersections of integral hyperplanes. On the
other hand, G is algebraic on h∗ and therefore its set of zeros must be Zariski
closed. Since a countable family of intersections of integral hyperplanes is
Zariski closed only if it is a finite family of such intersections, the set K must
have codimension ≥ 2.
Let now τ0 ∈ h∗ − (S ∪ S2 ). We have to show G(τ0 ) 6= 0.
      / Hν , we have δν (τ0 ) 6= 0 and τ0 ∈ U = h∗ − (Hν ∪ S). Now G equals
If τ0 ∈
δν fν on U and hence G(τ0 ) = δν (τ0 )fν (τ0 ) 6= 0.
Let now τ0 ∈ Hν . Again by the first part of the proof we know that there is
                                                                    −1
an open neighborhood U0 of τ0 , such that G(τ ) = δ̄ν (τ ) ū(τ )       zτ (eν ⊗ vτ )
for all τ ∈ U0 . Since δ̄ν (τ0 ) 6= 0 it thus suffices to show
(∗∗)’ zτ0 (eν ⊗ vτ0 ) 6= 0.
In order to do this, we will use Lemma 6 to 9 of the following section. Set
e := eν and denote the projection onto the central character χ(τ0 + ν) by
pr = prχ(τ0 +ν) : V ։ V .
Since τ0 ∈ Hν − S2 , there exists exactly one α ∈ R+ such that hτ0 , α∨ i ∈ Z.
Therefore, Rτ0 := {β ∈ R | hτ0 , β ∨ i ∈ Z} = {α, −α} and hence the Weyl

group Wτ0 of this root system Rτ0 equals Wτ0 = hsβ | β ∈ Rτ0 i = hsα i. For
τ0 and µ0 = ν − hτ0 + ν + ρ, α∨ iα we may then apply Lemma 8 and obtain
a short exact sequence
         M                                             
                    M (sα · (τ0 + ν)) ֒→ pr E ⊗ M (τ0 ) ։ L(τ0 + ν)
            dim Eµ0
                                       
such that pr(e⊗ vτ0 )/ pr E ⊗ M (τ0 ) generates the simple module L(τ0 + ν).
The module pr E⊗M (τ0 ) is projective (Lemma 7) and this forces the above
short exact sequence to be a nontrivial extension because otherwise, being a
direct summand, L(τ0 +ν) would be projective too. This contradicts Lemma
7.
Therefore (see for example [HS, Ch.3, Lemma   L 4.1]) we have at least one
direct summand M (sα · (τ0 + ν)) of R2 :=       dim Eµ0 M (sα · (τ0 + ν)), such
that the projection pro : R2 ։ M (sα · (τ0 + ν)) induces a nontrivial exten-

that the following diagram commutes (the rows are exact, PO is a push-out

Since the bottom row is a nontrivial extension and since Wτ0 +ν = Wτ0 =
hsα i, the push-out PO is isomorphic to P (τ0 + ν), the projective cover of
L(τ0 + ν) in O (Lemma 6). In the right loop of the above diagram lies the
following element diagram

Since pr(e ⊗ vτ0 )/R2 is a generator of L(τ0 + ν) we conclude that pro

  ˜ zτ0 pr(e ⊗ vτ0 ) and we obtain zτ0 pr(e ⊗ vτ0 ) 6= 0. Therefore, claim (∗∗)’
pro

Lemma 6, 7, 8 and 9 hold.
3.3. Proof of Lemma 6, 7, 8 and 9. In the following let eν denote
again the fixed extremal weight vector of the finite dimensional irreducible
g-module E = E(ν). Set vτ ∈ M (τ ) the canonical generator of the Verma
module and let V := E ⊗ U(n− ) ∼    = E ⊗ M (τ ) for all τ ∈ h∗ . The category
O is the category of all finitely generated g-modules, which are b-finite and

semisimple over h [BGG2]. For λ ∈ h∗ set Wλ := {w ∈ W | λ − wλ ∈ P }
and Rλ := {β ∈ R | hλ, β ∨ i ∈ Z}. The group Wλ is then the Weyl group to
the root system Rλ [Ja1, 1.3]. Denote by P (λ) the projective cover in O of
the simple module L(λ).
Lemma 6. Let λ ∈ h∗ with Wλ = hsα i and M (λ) = L(λ) simple. If the
short exact sequence M (sα · λ) ֒→ N ։ L(λ) is a nontrivial extension, then
N is isomorphic to P (λ).
Proof. For λ with Wλ = hsα i there exists in O (up to isomorphism) a unique
indecomposable projective module P (λ), such that the short exact sequence
                            M (sα · λ) ֒→ P (λ) ։ L(λ)
is a nontrivial extension [BGG2, Ch.4]. We thus have a nontrivial element
of Ext1 L(λ), M (sα · λ) . The assertion follows immediately if we knew
that dim Ext1 L(λ), M (sα · λ) ≤ 1. Indeed, construct for M (sα · λ) ֒→
P (λ) ։ L(λ) the long exact homology sequence [HS, Ch.3, Thm.5.3] (set
M = M (sα · λ), P = P (λ), L = L(λ), Ext = ExtO and let ω be the connect-
ing homomorphism):
                        ω
     · · · → Hom(M, M ) → Ext1 (L, M ) → Ext1 (P, M ) → Ext1 (M, M ) → · · ·
and note that Ext1 (P, M ) = 0 since P = P (λ) is projective [HS, Chap.3,
Prop.2.6.]. By exactness we obtain ω surjective. Since now for any Verma
module M dim Hom(M, M ) = 1, we conclude that dim Ext1 (L, M ) ≤ 1.

     prχ(τ +ν) E ⊗ M (τ ) is a projective object of the category O.
 (b) If hτ + ν + ρ, α∨ i ≤ 0, then M (τ + ν) = L(τ + ν) is simple and not
     projective.
Proof. a) A Verma module M (λ) is projective if hλ + ρ, β ∨ i ≥ 0 for all
β ∈ Rλ ∩ R+ [Ja2, 4.8]. Since Wτ = hsα i, we have Rτ ∩ R+ = {α} and hence
M (τ ) is projective. Then also E ⊗ M (τ ) is projective, because for E with
dim E < ∞ the functor
                             FE :    O   −→   O
                                     M   7→ E ⊗ M

maps projective objects of O to projective objects of O [BG]. Its direct
summand prχ(τ +ν) E ⊗ M (τ ) ⊂ E ⊗ M (τ ) is then projective too.
b) A Verma module M (λ) is simple if and only if hλ + ρ, β ∨ i ≤ 0 for all
β ∈ Rλ ∩ R+ [Di, 7.6.24] or [Ja1, 1.8, 1.9]. Since Wτ +ν = Wτ = hsα i we
obtain Rτ +ν ∩ R+ = {α} and the simplicity of M (τ + ν) = L(τ + ν) follows.
Since the short exact sequence M (sα · (τ + ν)) ֒→ P (τ + ν) ։ L(τ + ν)
is a nontrivial extension [BGG2, Ch.4], the module L(τ + ν) cannot be
projective.

Lemma 8. Let τ ∈ h∗ with Wτ = hsα i and µ0 := ν−hτ +ν+ρ,     α∨ iα ∈ P (E)
such that µ0 > ν. Then the module prχ(τ +ν) E ⊗ M (τ ) admits a chain of
submodules

                  prχ(τ +ν) E ⊗ M (τ ) = R1 ⊃ R2 ⊃ 0,
such that R2 ∼
             = dim Eµ M (sα · (τ + ν)) and R1 /R2 ∼
               L

and such that L(τ + ν) is generated by prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ ) /R2 .
Proof. Let µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µm be the weights of E without multiplicities, num-
bered such that µi < µj ⇒ i < j. Set µj0 := ν, µj1 := µ0 , dj := dim Eµj
and pr := prχ(τ +ν) . From chapter 2 we already know that E ⊗ M (τ ) has a
                                                                                  ∼
L of submodules E ⊗M (τ ) = M1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Mm ⊃ 0 such that Mj /Mj+1 =
chain
   dj M (τ + µj ). It is then clear that pr(E⊗M (τ )) = pr M1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ pr Mm ⊃
0 is a chain of L submodules such that the subquotients pr Mj / pr Mj+1 are
isomorphic to       dj M (τ + µj ), if τ + µj ∈ W · (τ + ν), otherwise they are
0. Since µj and ν are integral weights, we get µj = w · (τ + ν) − τ only for
w ∈ Wτ . For w = e this yields µj0 = ν, for w = sα we obtain µj1 = µ0
since τ + µ0 = sα · (τ + ν). By assumption we have µj0 = ν < µ0 = µj1 ,
and thus j0 < j1 . Therefore, if we       omit in this chain trivial submodules
we obtain a chainL      pr E ⊗ M (τ ) = pr   LMj0 =: R1 ⊃ pr Mj1 =: R2 ⊃ ∼        0
such that R2 ∼   =        dj1 M (τ + µ 0 ) =   dj1 M (s α · (τ + ν)) and R 1 /R 2 =
L
       M (τ + ν)  ∼
                  =  M   (τ  + ν). By  construction of the Mi this module is gen-
   dj0
erated by prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ )/R2 . Now µ0 > ν forces hτ + ν + ρ, α∨ i < 0
and together with Wτ +ν = Wτ = hsα i this implies M (τ + ν) = L(τ + ν)
(Lemma 7).
For µ ∈ h∗ define maps Hµ : h∗ × h∗ → k by       Q Hµ (λ, τ ) := hλ − τ −

Then zτ0 ∈ / AnnZ P (τ0 + ν).
Proof. We will first give an explicit description of the annihilator AnnZ P (τ0 +

β ∈ R+ ∩ Rλ we have hλ + ρ, β ∨ i ≥ 0. Denote by wλ ∈ Wλ the longest

Here P + (h∗ ) denotes the set of polynomial functions on h∗ without constant
term. We want to describe the annihilator of P (τ0 + ν) and choose for this
λ0 := sα · (τ0 + ν) = τ0 + µ0 = τ0 + ν − hτ0 + ν + ρ, α∨ iα. We then have
Wλ0 = Wsα ·(τ0 +ν) = Wτ0 +ν = Wτ0 = hsα i and hence Rλ0 = {α, −α}. By
assumption we know that hλ0 + ρ, α∨ i ≥ 0 and obtain for all β ∈ R+ ∩ Rλ0
that hλ0 + ρ, β ∨ i ≥ 0. Now wλ0 = sα is the longest element in Wλ0 and
we may apply Soergel’s theorem with λ := λ0 = sα · (τ0 + ν).     P Assume we
had ξ −1 (p) ∈ AnnZ P (wλ0 · λ0 ) = AnnZ P (τ0 + ν) for p = ni=1 pi qi with
              W
pi ∈ P + (h∗ ) λ0 and qi ∈ P(h∗ ). Then it follows for all pi that
                                                                          ∗

                     0 (pi ) (µ) = λ0 (pi ) (sα µ) = pi (λ0 + sα µ) ∀µ ∈ h .

For µ = α we obtain pi (λ0 + α) = pi (λ0 − α) and this forces the derivative
of p in direction of α to vanish at the point λ0 . Let’s    Q check this condition
for pτ . By definition we have for all λ ∈ h∗ : pτ (λ) = µ>ν,w∈W Hµ (w · λ, τ ).
If we define p̄τ by p̄τ Hµ0 (−, τ ) = pτ , we obtain
                                       Y
                        p̄τ (λ) :=             Hµ (w · λ, τ ).
                                   (w,µ)6=(e,µ0 )
                                    w∈W,µ>ν

Let p′τ denote the derivative of pτ in direction α. By the product rule we
have p′τ = p̄′τ Hµ0 (−, τ ) + p̄τ Hµ′ 0 (−, τ ).
                                                                          
Since sα · (τ0 + ν) = τ0 + µ0 it follows that Hµ0 sα · (τ0 + ν), τ0 = 0 and
we get p′τ0 sα · (τ0 + ν) = p̄τ0 sα · (τ0 + ν) Hµ′ 0 sα · (τ0 + ν), τ0 . But now
neither of these two factors is zero because

and by assumption  (b) none of the factors Hµ w·(τ    0 +ν), τ0 vanishes,   hence
p̄τ0 sα · (τ0 + ν) 6= 0. On the other hand, also Hµ′ 0 sα · (τ0 + ν), τ0 6= 0 since
                                                                        

by assumption (a) we have: Hµ′ 0 (λ, τ0 ) = ddt |t=0 hλ + tα − τ0 − µ0 , hµ0 i =

Together this implies p′τ0 sα · (τ0 + ν) 6= 0 and therefore ξ(pτ0 ) = zτ0 cannot

4.1. Preliminaries. Let M be a representation of g and E a vector space.
Then E ⊗ M is a representation of g via X(e ⊗ m) := e ⊗ Xm for all
X ∈ g, e ∈ E and m ∈ M . If in addition E is also a representation of g, then
we obtain a second g-operation on E ⊗M via X(e⊗m) := Xe⊗m+e⊗Xm.
To distinguish these two representations we denote the first one by E ⊗M ˆ .
Let now E be a finite dimensional representation of g and ν ∈ P a weight

Remark. For a generic weight, i.e. a weight τ ∈ h∗ such that hτ, α∨ i ∈/ Z for
all α ∈ R, the central characters χ(τ + µ) for µ ∈ P (E) are pairwise distinct.
In particular, in this case the condition of the lemma is always satisfied.
Proof. By the so-called tensor identity we have a canonical isomorphism
                                         ∼
                    U ⊗U(b) (E ⊗ kτ ) −→ E ⊗ (U ⊗U(b) kτ )
such that u⊗(e⊗a) 7→ u(e⊗(1⊗a)). Call the left hand side F , the right hand
side is E ⊗ M (τ ). Denote by µ1 , . . . , µm the weights of E. The filtration
E ⊗ M (τ ) = M1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Mm ⊃ 0, where the subquotients are isomorphic
to direct sums of Verma modules (see page 4), induces a filtration of F :
U ⊗U(b) (E ⊗ kτ ) = F = F1 ⊃ F2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Fm ⊃ 0 such that
                         Fj /Fj+1 ∼
                                  = U ⊗U(b) (Eµj ⊗ kτ ).
Now here the right hand side is canonically isomorphic to Eµj ⊗M        ˆ (τ + µj )
(by mapping e ⊗ uvτ +µj 7→ u ⊗ (e ⊗ 1)) and in particular, we have that
χ (τ + µj ) (Fj /Fj+1 ) = 0.
Let now ν = µi for a fixed i. By the condition on τ we know that χ(τ + ν) 6=
χ(τ + µj ) for all j 6= i, j ∈ {1, . . . , m} and hence prχ(τ +ν) (Fj /Fj+1 ) = 0 for
all j 6= i. Thus we get prχ(τ +ν) F = prχ(τ +ν) F1 = . . . = prχ(τ +ν) Fi and also
prχ(τ +ν) Fi+1 = . . . = prχ(τ +ν) Fm = 0. We conclude that prχ(τ +ν) F ⊂ Fi
and that Fi+1 ⊂ ker(prχ(τ +ν) : Fi ։ prχ(τ +ν) F ). Since prχ(τ +ν) (Fi /Fi+1 ) =
Fi /Fi+1 , we know even that Fi+1 is equal to this kernel. This now induces
a natural isomorphism
                                        ∼
                             Fi /Fi+1 −→ prχ(τ +ν) F

We apply the tensor identity F ∼
                               = E ⊗ M (τ ) and the lemma follows.
Let us recall the theorem of Bernstein and Gelfand [BG] for projective func-
tors. For this denote by M the category of all Z-finite g-modules and for

 M∞ (χ) := {M ∈ M | for all m ∈ M exists n ∈ N such that χn m = 0}.
A projective χ-functor is then a functor F : M(χ) → M, which is iso-
morphic to a direct summand of a functor E⊗ for a finite dimensional
representation E. In particular, the restriction of the translation functor

to F̃ .
Theorem. [BG, 3.5] Let F, F̃ : M(χ) → M be projective χ-functors and
let τ ∈ h∗ such that χ(τ ) = χ and M (τ ) is projective. Then the obvious map

Remark. (i) The Verma module M (τ ) is projective if and only if hτ +
      ρ, α∨ i ∈/ {−1, −2, . . . } for all α ∈ R+ . In particular, for a generic
      weight τ the Verma module M (τ ) is always projective.
 (ii) Note that in [BG] the Verma module with highest weight τ is denoted
      by Mτ +ρ . Accordingly, the theorem there is formulated for all τ with
      hτ, α∨ i ∈

on the zero weight space (E(µ)∗ ⊗ E(ν)∗ ⊗ E(ν + µ))0 .
Now take for τ not only any, but rather the generic weight: For this denote
by S := Sk (h) the symmetric algebra of h and let K := Quot(S) be its
quotient field. We then have a k-linear map h ֒→ S ֒→ K and obtain thus a
K-linear map τ : K ⊗k h −→ K such that the following diagram commutes
                                h    −−−→ S
                                           
                                           
                               y            y
                                           τ
                               K ⊗k h −−−→ K
With this τ (= tautologous) we then obtain ∆(µ, ν; x)(τ ) ∈ K × . These are
the triangle functions.
4.3. Uncanonical definition of ∆. We defined the triangle functions by
a series of canonical isomorphisms. For our purposes it is sometimes more
convenient to realize the triangle functions in the following – uncanonical
– way: Let ν ∈ P , x ∈ W and choose a fixed extremal weight vector
0 6= eν ∈ E(ν)ν . Since extremal weight spaces are one dimensional, this
choice is unique up to non-zero scalar. By Lemma 10 we obtain for generic
τ ∈ h∗ a – no longer canonical – isomorphism
                                               ∼
          Fxν (x · τ ) : M (x · (τ + ν)) −→    Tττ +ν M (x · τ )
                            vx·(τ +ν)    7→ prχ(τ +ν) (ẋeν ⊗ vx·τ )
Here ẋ ∈ G denotes a pre-image of x ∈ W ∼   = NG T /T . We have ẋeν ∈
E(ν)xν . Let now µ ∈ P be another weight. Choose ẽµ ∈ E(µ)µ and
ēµ+ν ∈ E(µ + ν)µ+ν , both non-zero, and consider for generic τ the fol-
lowing sequence of isomorphisms:
                  +ν+µ
  HomM(χ(τ ))→ Tττ+ν   ◦ Tττ +ν , Tττ +ν+µ
                                             
              ∼         +ν+µ τ +ν
             −→ Homg Tττ+ν   Tτ M (x · τ ), Tττ +ν+µ M (x · τ )
                                                               
              ∼                                                
             −→ Homg M (x · (τ + ν + µ)), M (x · (τ + ν + µ))
              ∼
             −→ k
Denote this map by Nat(µ, ν; x)(τ ). Here again the first isomorphism is
clear by the Theorem of Bernstein-Gelfand, the second is due to the the
                                                 +ν+µ
maps Fx(ν+µ) (x · τ ) and Fxµ (x · (τ + µ)) ◦ Tττ+ν   Fxν (x · τ ). We then obtain
           ∆(µ, ν; x)(τ ) = Nat(µ, ν; x)(τ ) ◦ (Nat(µ, ν; e)(τ ))−1 (1).
It follows that this characterization of ∆ is independent of the choice of the
weight vectors eν , ẽµ and ēµ+ν , and also independent of the choice of the
pre-image ẋ of x.

        5. Bernstein’s relative trace and a special case of ∆
5.1. The relative trace. Let us recall the definition of the relative trace
trE defined by Bernstein in [Be]. Let g-mod be the category of all g-
modules and let E be a finite dimensional g-module. Denote by FE :
g-mod → g-mod the functor defined by FE (M ) := E ⊗ M . The relative
trace trE : Endg-mod (FE ) → Endg-mod (Id) is then a morphism from the
16                              KAREN GÜNZL

endomorphisms of the functor FE to the endomorphisms of the identity
functor on g-mod, defined by
                    trM
                      E : Endg (E ⊗ M ) → Endg M
                                a       7→ trM
                                             E (a)
where
                    i                    id ⊗a                          cont ⊗ id
     trM               ∗              ∗
       E (a) : M −−−→ E ⊗ E ⊗ M −−−→ E ⊗ E ⊗ M −−−−−→ M
                                                        .
                        j                   c
Here, i is the map M ֒→ Endg (E) ⊗ M → E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M with j(m) := idE ⊗m
and c the canonical isomorphism Endg (E) ∼      = E ∗ ⊗ E. The map cont :
E ∗ ⊗ E → k denotes the evaluation map.
Bernstein has calculated an explicit formula for the relative trace, by con-
sidering it as a map from P(h∗ )W· to itself in the following way: First, we
identify Endg-mod (Id) ∼ = Z with the center of the enveloping algebra U, then
we make use of the natural morphism Z → Endg-mod (FE ) and composing
this with the trace map we obtain trE : Z → Z. By means of the Harish-
                               ∼
Chandra isomorphism ξ : Z −→ P(h∗ )W· (normalized by z − ξ(z) ∈ Un) we
may then regard trE as an endomorphism of P(h∗ )W· .
Define
P       now on P(h∗ ) a convolution f 7→ P (E) ∗ f by (P (E) ∗ f )(λ) :=
   µ∈P (E) f (λ + µ), where the sum is taken over all weights µ ∈ P (E) with
their multiplicities. Set Λ(λ) := α∈R+ hλ + ρ, α∨ i. Then we have
                                  Q

Theorem. [Be] trE (f ) = Λ−1 (P (E) ∗ Λf ) for all f ∈ P(h∗ )W· .
If we choose now for M the Verma module M (λ) we can associate to each en-
                                                  M (λ)
domorphism f ∈ Endg (E⊗M (λ)) an element trE (f ) of Endg (M (λ)) ∼  = k.
As endomorphism of M (λ) this element operates on M (λ) by multiplication
                    M (λ)
with the scalar (trE (f ))(λ) and we obtain by Bernstein’s Theorem for all
λ ∈ h∗ and for all w ∈ W
               M (w·λ)
                       (f ) (λ) = Λ−1 (P (E) ∗ Λf ) (λ)

                                = (Λ(λ))−1

5.2. The special case ∆(−ν, ν; w0 ). Let now E = E(ν), w0 ∈ W the
longest element and prχ(τ +ν) ∈ Endg (E(ν) ⊗ M (w0 · τ )) the projection on
                                                M (w ·τ )
the central character χ(τ + ν). Then trE(ν) 0               (prχ(τ +ν) ) is an element in
Endg (M (w0 · τ )) ∼
                   = k and we have
Theorem 2. Let ν ∈ P + be a dominant weight and τ ∈ h∗ generic. Then
                                         M (w ·τ )
                   ∆(−ν, ν; w0 )(τ ) = trE(ν) 0       (prχ(τ +ν) ).
Proof. Postponed to 5.3.
Regarding ∆(−ν, ν; w0 ) as a polynomial function on h∗ we obtain for this
special case an explicit formula:
Corollary. Let ν ∈ P + be a dominant weight and τ ∈ h∗ generic. Then
                                    Y hτ + ν + ρ, α∨ i
                ∆(−ν, ν; w0 )(τ ) =                    .

Proof. Under the morphism P(h∗ )W· ∼    = Z → Endg-mod (FE ) the projection
prχ(τ +ν) is the image of a polynomial function, which takes value 1 at all
weights λ ∈ W ·(τ +ν) and vanishes at all other weights τ +µ with µ ∈ P (E).
Call this polynomial function pr.¯ By Bernstein’s formula for the relative
trace we then obtain

                                           µ∈P (E(ν))

and by definition of pr                  ¯ + µ) for µ ∈ P (E) does not vanish
                          ¯ the value of pr(τ
if and only if there is a w ∈ W such that w · (τ + µ) = (τ + ν). Since
τ is generic, this is only possible for w = e and hence µ = ν. In this
case we have pr(τ
P                ¯ + ν) = 1 and since furthermore dim E(ν)ν = 1, we get
   µ∈P (E(ν)) Λ(τ  +µ) pr(τ
                          ¯ +µ) = Λ(τ +ν). The claim now follows by Theorem
2 and the equation
                M (w ·τ )          Λ(τ + ν)    Y hτ + ν + ρ, α∨ i
              trE(ν) 0 (pr)¯ (τ ) =           =                    .

                                                     hτ + ρ, α∨ i

5.3. Proof of Theorem 2. First we make some more general preliminary
remarks.

5.3.1. The adjunctions (Tττ +ν , Tττ+ν ) and (Tττ+ν , Tττ +ν ). Let A and B be cat-
egories and F : A → B, G : B → A two functors. Then an adjunction (F, G)
of F and G is a family of isomorphisms
                                                      ∼
         (F, G)M,N := (F, G) : HomB (F M, N ) −→ HomA (M, GN ),
which is natural in M and N (M ∈ A, N ∈ B).
For example, for E a finite dimensional g-module we obtain an adjunction
(FE , FE ∗ ) of FE : g-mod → g-mod and FE ∗ : g-mod → g-mod as the compo-
sition
Homg (E ⊗ M, N ) → Homg (E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M, E ∗ ⊗ N ) → Homg (M, E ∗ ⊗ N ).
Here, the first map is given by f 7→ idE ∗ ⊗f , the second by g 7→ g ◦ i.
Interchanging E and E ∗ we obtain in the same way an adjunction (FE ∗ , FE ).
Its inverse is the composition
Homg (M, E ⊗ N ) → Homg (E ∗ ⊗ M, E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ N ) → Homg (E ∗ ⊗ M, N ),
where the first map is again given by f 7→ idE ∗ ⊗f and the second by
g 7→ (cont ⊗ idN ) ◦ g. Let now ν ∈ P be an integral weight. Each identi-
                     ∼
fication ϕ : E(ν)∗ −→ E(−ν) then defines adjunctions (FE(ν) , FE(−ν) ) and
(FE(−ν) , FE(ν) ). More precisely, we have
                                                  ∼
  (FE(ν) , FE(−ν) ) :    Homg (E(ν) ⊗ M, N ) −→ Homg (M, E(−ν) ⊗ N )
                                 f            7→     (ϕ ⊗ f ) ◦ i
and
                                                   ∼
 (FE(−ν) , FE(ν) )−1 :   Homg (M, E(ν) ⊗ N ) −→ Homg (E(−ν) ⊗ M, N )
                                 g           7→ (cont ⊗ idN ) ◦ (ϕ−1 ⊗ g)
18                                          KAREN GÜNZL

Let now iχ : M∞ (χ) ֒→ M denote the embedding functor. We then have
in a natural way adjunctions (iχ , prχ ) and (prχ , iχ ). Since for the transla-
tion functor Tττ +ν = prχ(τ +ν) ◦FE(ν) ◦ iχ(τ ) , we thus obtain also adjunctions
(Tττ +ν , Tττ+ν ) and (Tττ+ν , Tττ +ν ).
5.3.2. The natural transformations adj1 and adj2 . Let M ∈ M∞ (χ(τ )) and
consider Id ∈ Homg (Tττ +ν M, Tττ +ν M ). By means of the two adjunctions
(Tττ +ν , Tττ+ν ) and (Tττ+ν , Tττ +ν )−1 we get two maps as the images of Id:
     adj1M ∈ Homg (M, Tττ+ν Tττ +ν M ) and adj2M ∈ Homg (Tττ+ν Tττ +ν M, M )
and one checks that we obtain in this way natural transformations adj1 ∈
HomM∞ (χ(τ ))→ (Id, Tττ+ν ◦Tττ +ν ) and adj2 ∈ HomM∞ (χ(τ ))→ (Tττ+ν ◦Tττ +ν , Id).
By composing these two maps, we get a canonical endomorphism of M :
                                 adj1                       adj2
                              M
                         M −−−→ Tττ+ν Tττ +ν M −−−→
                                                  M
                                                    M.
We want to describe this endomorphism in more detail. By definition, the
adjunction (Tττ +ν , Tττ+ν ) is just the composition of adjunctions (iχ(τ ) , prχ(τ ) )◦
(FE(ν) , FE(−ν) ) ◦ (prχ(τ +ν) , iχ(τ +ν) ) and one checks easily that the image of
Id ∈ Homg (Tττ +ν M, Tττ +ν M ) under (prχ(τ +ν) , iχ(τ +ν) ) is precisely the pro-
jection prχ(τ +ν) . Thus, the image of Id under the adjunction (Tττ +ν , Tττ+ν )
can be described by the composition
                                            ϕ⊗pr
                adj1M : M −−−→
                            i
                               E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M −−−→ Tττ+ν Tττ +ν M.
Here, we put E = E(ν) and pr = prχ(τ +ν) . Analogously, we obtain for adj2M
the composition
                                            −1
           adj2M : T τ T τ +ν M −ϕ−−−
                                    ⊗pr              cont ⊗ id
                                     −→ E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M −−−−−−M    → M
                    τ +ν τ
and taken together we have the following commutative diagram:
                                adj1                             adj2

                                               x                                  x
                                        ϕ⊗idE⊗M                        cont ⊗ idM 
                                                                                 
                iy

                           id    ∗   ⊗ pr                   id    ∗   ⊗ pr
         E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M −−E−−−→ E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M −−E−−−→ E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M
We thus obtain for adj2M ◦ adj1M
            i                           idE ∗ ⊗ prχ(τ +ν)                      cont ⊗ id
    M −−−→ E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M −−−−−−−−−−→ E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M −−−−−−M           → M.
Comparing this with the relative trace trE for E = E(ν), it follows imme-
diately for all M ∈ M∞ (χ(τ )) that
                     adj2M ◦ adj1M = trM
                                       E(ν) (prχ(τ +ν) ) ∈ Endg (M )

or, regarded as natural transformation of the identity functor Id : M∞ (χ(τ ))
→ M∞ (χ(τ )) to itself
                            adj2 ◦ adj1 = trE(ν) (prχ(τ +ν) ).
Let now ιχ : M(χ) ֒→ M denote the embedding functor, let F, G : M∞ (χ) →
M be functors and denote by F (χ), resp. G(χ) its restrictions to the sub-
category M(χ). Each natural transformation n from F to G can be re-
garded as natural transformation from F (χ) to G(χ) by first applying ιχ

and then n. In particular, we obtain in this way the two natural transfor-
mations adj1 ∈ HomM(χ(τ ))→ Id(χ), Tττ+ν ◦ Tττ +ν (χ) and similarly adj2 ∈

5.3.3. We have ∆(−ν, ν; w0 )(τ ) = adj2M (w0 ·τ ) ◦ adj1M (w0 ·τ ) . By choosing for
M the Verma module M (τ ), we can assign to each τ ∈ h∗ a canonical element
adj2M (τ ) ◦ adj1M (τ ) ∈ End(M (τ )) ∼
                                      = k. We will see in the following, that
for dominant ν this is precisely the triangle function ∆(−ν, ν; w0 )(τ ). For
                                                                                     ∼
x ∈ W and τ generic we call φx (x·τ ) the isomorphism Tττ+ν Tττ +ν M (x · τ ) −→
M (x · τ ) given by (φx (x · τ ))−1 = Tττ+ν Fxν (x · τ ) ◦ F−xν (x · (τ + ν)) (see 4.3).
First we show that for dominant ν and generic τ the following diagram
commutes:
                                                 adj2M (τ )

Let again denote eν ∈ E(ν)ν the fixed extremal weight vector for a dominant
integral weight ν. Since w0 is the longest element in the Weyl group the
dominance of ν implies that e−ν := ẇ0 eν is a weight vector of weight −ν.
Here, ẇ0 ∈ G is a representative of w0 ∈ NG (T )/T .
Define now a pairing E(−ν) × E(ν) → k by he−ν , eν i := 1 and obtain thus
                                    ∼
an identification ϕ : E(ν)∗ −→ E(−ν). Let vτ ∈ M (τ ) be the canonical
generator. To see that the above diagram commutes, it suffices to show that
the pre-image of vτ in Tττ+ν Tττ +ν M (τ ) is mapped again to vτ when applying
adj2M (τ ) . We have

         (φe (τ ))−1 (vτ ) = prχ(τ ) e−ν ⊗ (prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ ))
                                                                 

                        = prχ(τ ) (e−ν ⊗ eν ⊗ vτ )
                                            M
                        = e−ν ⊗ eν ⊗ vτ −                        prχ (e−ν ⊗ eν ⊗ vτ ).
                                                      χ6=χ(τ )

The first equation holds by definition of φe (τ ), the second follows since for
dominant ν we have prχ(τ +ν) (eν ⊗ vτ ) = eν ⊗ vτ (see the example on page
6) and the third equation is just direct sum decomposition. Since adj2M was
the composition
                                ϕ−1 ⊗pr                          cont ⊗ id
              Tττ+ν Tττ +ν M −−−−−→ E ∗ ⊗ E ⊗ M −−−−−−M
                                                      → M

we know in particular that adj2M (τ ) is a g-module homomorphism to M (τ ).
Then it is clear, that adj2M (τ ) maps χ6=χ(τ ) prχ (e−ν ⊗ eν ⊗ vτ ) to zero since
                                        L

this element has wrong central character. For e−ν ⊗ eν ⊗ vτ we use the fact
that he−ν , eν i = 1 and obtain as image under adj2M (τ ) precisely vτ . Taken
together, we get adj2M (τ ) = id ◦φe (τ ), i.e. the above diagram commutes.
This now means that under the map Nat(−ν, ν; e)(τ ) the image of adj2 ∈
HomM(χ(τ ))→ Tττ+ν ◦ Tττ +ν (χ), Tττ (χ) is just the identity id ∈ End(M (τ )).

The commutativity of the left hand side can be shown in an analogous way.
We thus obtain for dominant ν
                      adj2M (w0 ·τ ) ◦ adj1M (w0 ·τ ) = ∆(−ν, ν; w0 )(τ )

from section 5.3.2 we deduce Theorem 2.

also a positive root. Then we obtain in δxν (x · τ ) the factor

on U and there exists an algebraic extension on h∗ whose set of zeros has
codimension ≥ 2.
Remark. Here, we call a map a : U → W to a vector space W algebraic, if it
is a morphism of varieties. Of course, this is defined only if dim W < ∞. In
our case however, the image of hx (ν1 , . . . , νn ) is always contained in
                                                                           a finite

Let now x ∈ W be fixed. For generic τ define then the map axν (τ ) by
    axν (τ ) : M (x · τ ) ∼
                          = U(n− ) −→ E(ν) ⊗ M (x · τ ) ∼

where fxν (x · τ ) = prχ(τ +ν) (ẋeν ⊗ vx·τ ). Since fν is algebraic on U (see
Theorem 1), we obtain in this way also an algebraic map
                axν : U −→ Homk U(n− ), E(ν) ⊗ U(n− )
                                                               

                      τ 7→                     axν (τ )
Here again, the image of axνis contained in a finite dimensional subspace of
Homk U(n− ), E(ν)⊗ U(n− ) and we regard axν in this way as a map between
varieties.
According to Theorem 1 there is an algebraic extension of δν fν on h∗ , which
vanishes only on a set of codimension ≥ 2. Therefore, also axν has such an
algebraic extension and we call it again axν . For generic τ we then have
(axν (τ ))(vx·τ ) = δxν (x · τ ) prχ(τ +ν) (ẋeν ⊗ vx·τ ). Note that for all τ ∈ h∗
the vector (axν (τ ))(vx·τ ) ∈ E(ν) ⊗ M (x · τ ) generates a Verma module with
highest weight x · (τ + ν). The image of axν (τ ) is thus always contained in
a Verma module M (x · (τ + ν)) ⊂ E(ν) ⊗ M (x · τ ) and we can identify the
element (axν (τ ))(vx·τ ) with the canonical generator vx·(τ +ν) ∈ M (x · (τ + ν)).
Using the isomorphism M (x · (τ + ν)) ∼        = U(n− ), we may then apply the map
axν′ (τ + ν) for another weight ν ′ ∈ P . In particular, we can concatenate the
maps axνn (τ + ν1 + · · · + νn−1 ) ◦ · · · ◦ axν2 (τ + ν1 ) ◦ axν1 (τ ) and obtain in this
way an algebraic map
       a : h∗ −→             Homk U(n− ), E(νn ) ⊗ · · · E(ν1 ) ⊗ U(n− )
                                                                                

weight τ to a(τ ) = δxν1 (x · τ )δxν2 (x · (τ + ν1 )) · · · δxνn (x · (τ + ν1 + · · · νn−1 ))
hx (ν1 , . . . , νn )(τ ) = dx (ν1 , . . . , νn )(τ )hx (ν1 , . . . , νn )(τ ). We thus obtain the
map a as the desired algebraic extension.

Lemma 14. Set D x (τ ) := δx(ν+µ) (x · τ )/δxν (x · τ )δxµ (x · (τ + ν)). Then the
map D x Gx is algebraic on U and there exists an algebraic extension on h∗
whose set of zeros has codimension ≥ 2.

Proof. Since the maps dx (ν1 , . . . , νn )hx (ν1 , . . . , νn ) have such algebraic ex-
tensions (Lemma 13), the commutativity of the above diagram implies that
also D x Gx has such an algebraic extension, where

       D x (τ ) = dx (ν + µ, −µ, −ν)(τ )dx (−ν, ν)(τ + ν)dx (−µ, µ)(τ + ν + µ)
              = δx(ν+µ) (x · τ )/δxν (x · τ )δxµ (x · (τ + ν)).



Finally, we come to the

Proof of Theorem 3. By Lemma 11 it suffices to show that ∆(µ, ν; x)(τ ) =
c π(τ + ρ) for a non-vanishing constant c. Note, that (D x /D e )(τ ) =
±π(τ + ρ). We deduce from Lemma 12 that for generic weights D x D e Ge =
∆(µ, ν; x)D e D x Gx . Since D e Ge as well as D x Gx have algebraic extensions
on h∗ which vanish only on a set of codimension ≥ 2 (Lemma 14), it follows
that there is a constant c ∈ k × , independent of τ, µ, ν and x, such that

                    c ∆(µ, ν; x)(τ ) = (D x /D e )(τ ) = ±π(τ + ρ).

By means of Theorem 3 or directly with the definition of ∆ one then checks

7.2. Generalizations.

7.2.1. The Weyl group parameter. Let ν, µ ∈ P and x, y ∈ W. Instead of
applying the translation functors to the Verma modules M (τ ) and M (x · τ ),
we may choose the Verma modules M (x · τ ) and M (y · τ ). We then define
a generalized triangle function ∆g by

    ∆g (µ, ν; y, x)(τ ) := det yx−1 ◦ nat(µ, ν; x)(τ ) ◦ (nat(µ, ν; y)(τ ))−1 .
                                                                             

We now have ∆g (µ, ν; e, x)(τ ) = ∆(µ, ν; x)(τ ) and going back to the defini-
tion of ∆g we deduce the identities
(I1) ∆g (µ, ν; y, x)(τ ) = (∆(µ, ν; y)(τ ))−1 ∆(µ, ν; x)(τ )
(I2) ∆g (µ, ν; y, x)(τ ) = (∆g (µ, ν; x, y)(τ ))−1
and
(I3) ∆g (µ, ν; y, x) ∆g (µ, ν; x, z) = ∆g (µ, ν; y, z).
The equivalent statement to the Rotation identity is obtained by comparing
(I1) with
(I4) ∆g (µ, ν; y, x)(τ ) = ∆(yµ, yν; xy −1 )(y · τ ).

7.2.2. Number of translations. The triangle functions measure in a subtle

Obviously we have ✸(µ, ν; ν + µ; x) = ∆(µ, ν; x) as well as
      ✸(µm , . . . , µ1 ; νn , . . . , ν1 ; x)(τ ) = (✸(νn , . . . , ν1 ; µm , . . . , µ1 ; x)(τ ))−1
and we can reduce the calculation of ✸ to the calculation of ∆ by means of
the
Split identities.
